01:53.466 --> 01:54.866
Hm.

01:54.868 --> 01:56.569
Hello, Ros.

01:59.705 --> 02:01.905
How's that novel
you're working on?

02:01.907 --> 02:05.645
It's okay, if you like scrumpled
pieces of paper in a bin.

02:06.947 --> 02:08.782
You just haven't
found your story yet.

02:13.853 --> 02:15.488
What's this one about?

02:16.722 --> 02:18.389
Um...

02:18.391 --> 02:21.394
Oh, kids, magic...

02:22.762 --> 02:24.730
Wishes that cause trouble.

02:26.832 --> 02:28.932
Sounds a bit young.

02:28.934 --> 02:31.504
Oh, no one's
too old for wishes.

02:33.506 --> 02:34.906
Let's go, monkey.

02:34.908 --> 02:36.776
Oh, no, no.
No charge.

02:37.777 --> 02:39.010
Thank you.

02:40.814 --> 02:43.715
Is that gel in your hair?

02:43.717 --> 02:45.783
Come on,
we're in a rush. Why?

02:45.785 --> 02:47.751
It looks weird.

02:47.753 --> 02:49.889
- How weird?
- Really weird.

03:01.367 --> 03:03.400
There you are!

03:03.402 --> 03:05.502
You are coming with me,
young lady.

03:05.504 --> 03:07.337
- I'm busy.
- Busy?

03:07.339 --> 03:09.707
This is not busy.

03:09.709 --> 03:11.542
I'm making friends.

03:11.544 --> 03:13.745
You said I should
make friends, right?

03:13.747 --> 03:16.647
Friends? This is not
what a friend looks like.

03:16.650 --> 03:21.318
This... this is a mugshot
on the six o'clock news.

03:21.320 --> 03:22.686
You're lucky
I don't call the cops.

03:22.688 --> 03:24.925
Go ahead. Any luck,
I'll get deported.

03:34.067 --> 03:36.433
Robbie...

03:36.435 --> 03:38.437
I thought I asked you
to pack!

03:39.773 --> 03:41.340
What good is that?

03:42.742 --> 03:44.676
What are you thinking
about wearing for underpants?

03:44.678 --> 03:47.511
Because those games cartridges are
not gonna supply adequate coverage.

03:47.513 --> 03:49.381
Come on,
bit of action, please!

04:11.104 --> 04:13.637
I just don't know
what's wrong with you, Smash.

04:13.639 --> 04:16.673
I've got a good mind not to take
you on this vacation at all.

04:16.675 --> 04:19.041
So don't. Take me somewhere
good.

04:19.043 --> 04:21.644
- Like back home.
- We <i>are</i> home.

04:21.647 --> 04:25.116
This sucky little country?
Have you seen what they eat?

04:25.118 --> 04:27.819
Mushy peas.
They eat mushy peas, Mom.

04:28.922 --> 04:30.420
And they drive
on the left!

04:31.657 --> 04:33.359
Oh, my gosh,
you almost killed us!

04:37.030 --> 04:40.597
You're gonna absolutely love this
place, guys, I promise.

04:40.599 --> 04:42.900
- Is there a phone signal?
- I hope not.

04:42.902 --> 04:45.669
Imagine that, Robbie?
All that peace and tranquility.

04:45.671 --> 04:47.138
Romping in the dunes.

04:47.140 --> 04:51.677
And there's a...
there's a bit of a surprise.

04:53.445 --> 04:56.413
- Is there Wi-Fi?
- No, there's no Wi-Fi.

04:56.415 --> 04:59.483
- Is that the surprise?
- No.

04:59.485 --> 05:02.886
- It isn't a very good surprise.
- Well, it's not the surprise.

05:02.888 --> 05:06.657
What if mum wants to phone us?
What if she's having a crisis?

05:06.660 --> 05:09.628
Mummy's a big girl,
she can look after herself.

05:13.166 --> 05:16.001
Robbie, if you play that thing all the
way, you're gonna be sick.

05:25.845 --> 05:28.812
See? I've been packed
for weeks.

05:28.814 --> 05:30.914
I did mention we're going
to the British coast, right?

05:30.916 --> 05:32.416
You are, maybe.

05:32.418 --> 05:34.518
This is my luggage
for the Seychelles,

05:34.520 --> 05:36.753
where I'm moving soon
as dad makes the call.

05:36.755 --> 05:38.655
Smash...

05:38.657 --> 05:40.824
Smash, I don't think
your dad is...

05:40.826 --> 05:42.960
Smash! Smash!

05:42.963 --> 05:44.828
Hey, Maudie!

05:44.830 --> 05:47.065
- You wanna fly?
- Yeah! Fly!

05:58.777 --> 06:01.713
- What is this?
- This is...

06:01.715 --> 06:03.447
It's just some sounds
I'm getting in to.

06:03.449 --> 06:05.083
Some new ones. Gotta, uh...

06:05.085 --> 06:07.152
They're quite cool, these guys, actually.
They're a...

06:08.989 --> 06:10.789
um... band.

06:12.192 --> 06:14.560
What do you think
the surprise is gonna be?

06:16.061 --> 06:19.162
- Nothing good.
- What if it's Mum?

06:19.164 --> 06:22.100
What if they're getting back together?
It'd be like before.

06:22.102 --> 06:25.669
Long silences
and emotional repression?

06:25.671 --> 06:29.910
Shh. Before that,
when it was all all right.

06:49.129 --> 06:52.596
There's white sand beaches in
the Seychelles, and flamingos.

06:52.598 --> 06:55.066
And probably tension,
and civil unrest.

06:55.068 --> 06:57.200
There's no unrest
in the Seychelles.

06:57.202 --> 06:59.636
Your father's there,
give them time.

07:02.242 --> 07:04.144
What is this?

07:06.011 --> 07:10.213
Oh, no, you have
got to be kidding me?

07:10.215 --> 07:13.216
What? I can cook.

07:13.218 --> 07:15.887
Well, I'm a mom,
aren't I?

07:15.889 --> 07:17.689
Moms are supposed to cook.

07:17.691 --> 07:19.556
I don't wanna get poisoned.

07:23.562 --> 07:25.296
- You can't cook!
- You'll see.

07:25.298 --> 07:26.732
You can't cook!

07:46.987 --> 07:50.121
So...
what do you think?

07:50.123 --> 07:51.989
I feel sick.

07:51.992 --> 07:53.790
Just keep calm, deep breaths.

07:53.792 --> 07:56.762
In through the nose,
out through the mouth.

08:03.702 --> 08:06.770
- It's coming out.
- Well, try to keep it in.

08:06.772 --> 08:08.807
- There you go, darling.
- Thanks.

08:12.177 --> 08:13.577
Deep breaths.

08:47.313 --> 08:48.314
Mum!

09:13.706 --> 09:15.338
Who are they?

09:17.142 --> 09:18.744
Let's go inside.

09:29.022 --> 09:31.254
Uh...

09:31.256 --> 09:35.328
Maudie, Smash,
this is David.

09:37.931 --> 09:41.201
Guys, I'd like you
to meet Alice.

09:44.037 --> 09:46.204
You should know your mum talks
about you girls all the time.

09:46.206 --> 09:48.139
Oh, what a coincidence.

09:48.141 --> 09:49.843
She doesn't talk
about you at all.

09:56.149 --> 09:57.951
Why are you holding hands?

10:00.919 --> 10:02.721
Well, um...

10:04.858 --> 10:06.723
We have something
to tell you.

10:06.725 --> 10:09.127
I feel sick.

10:09.129 --> 10:11.231
Ros, Robbie...

10:12.332 --> 10:14.197
Your dad and I, well, um...

10:14.199 --> 10:18.201
We've been, well,
we've been, um...

10:18.203 --> 10:20.872
We've been seeing
each other.

10:20.874 --> 10:23.306
That is revolting!

10:23.309 --> 10:26.878
- Hey, Smash.
- Can we go home, please?

10:26.880 --> 10:29.780
Wait, when you say
"seeing each other,"

10:29.782 --> 10:32.083
you mean <i>seeing</i> each other?

10:32.085 --> 10:35.052
Look, this holiday's a great opportunity
for everyone to get to know each other.

10:35.054 --> 10:37.257
Come on. What do you say?

10:45.931 --> 10:48.131
Great going, Mom.

10:48.133 --> 10:51.638
You ruined my life.
Again.

10:52.472 --> 10:54.174
I'm going to my room.

10:55.741 --> 10:57.776
Okay. Let's go inside...

11:00.879 --> 11:03.048
But... but what about Mum?

11:04.284 --> 11:06.286
Ros, Mum's not...

11:08.221 --> 11:09.953
Hey!

11:09.955 --> 11:12.789
That's my room!
I was here first!

11:12.791 --> 11:14.758
Are you kidding me?
It's my room!

11:14.760 --> 11:16.930
I said get out!

11:18.764 --> 11:20.897
Stop it!
It's my room now!

11:20.899 --> 11:22.400
I was here first!

11:22.402 --> 11:25.102
- Stop it, go away!
- It's my room!

11:37.050 --> 11:39.918
This is my half.
Stay out.

11:47.160 --> 11:49.160
Who brings books
on a holiday?

11:49.162 --> 11:52.197
- People who can read.
- People with no lives.

11:56.802 --> 11:58.871
Look at these losers.

12:00.005 --> 12:01.374
Get off that.

12:10.849 --> 12:12.550
Hey...

12:12.552 --> 12:14.920
Look, we're gonna make it
work, for all of them.

12:16.155 --> 12:17.388
Yes, we are.

12:17.390 --> 12:19.292
- Is that...?
- Yes.

12:20.460 --> 12:23.226
Oh!

12:23.228 --> 12:24.996
Get off of me!

12:26.231 --> 12:27.431
- You get off of me!
- Stop it!

12:27.433 --> 12:29.032
Hey!

12:29.034 --> 12:30.901
- Both of you, calm down.
- She started it!

12:30.903 --> 12:33.204
- She started it!
- Smash, you're just impossible.

12:33.206 --> 12:34.472
I don't wanna be here!

12:34.474 --> 12:35.906
I don't want
to be here!

12:35.908 --> 12:38.009
Right!
I have an idea.

12:38.011 --> 12:41.281
Why don't we all go...
for a picnic?

12:49.254 --> 12:51.555
This place is gross.

12:51.557 --> 12:53.224
Smash, try to be nice.

12:53.226 --> 12:56.059
How? There's all this
gross stuff on my shoe.

12:56.061 --> 12:57.395
Tell you what,
why don't we play a game?

12:57.397 --> 12:58.496
I spy with my little eye,

12:58.498 --> 13:01.299
something beginning with W.

13:01.301 --> 13:03.266
Weirdo.

13:03.268 --> 13:05.505
Maudie, David
is not a weirdo.

13:07.507 --> 13:10.308
- Oh.
- Hello!

13:10.310 --> 13:14.111
You must be the new tenants
over at the cottage.

13:14.113 --> 13:16.447
You must be Mr. Trent
from the, uh...

13:16.449 --> 13:19.916
The mansion? Yes, that's
right, I live in a mansion.

13:19.918 --> 13:21.985
This is all
part of my estate.

13:21.987 --> 13:24.490
This is, um,
quite some backyard you got here.

13:26.992 --> 13:30.161
Oh, I'm sorry, I can't quite
understand what you're saying.

13:30.163 --> 13:32.295
Oh!

13:32.298 --> 13:35.667
- Alice is American.
- Ah! You're an American.

13:35.669 --> 13:37.603
For a moment I thought
you had a speech impediment.

13:39.138 --> 13:43.006
And you've got...
four children!

13:43.008 --> 13:44.642
You have been busy,
haven't you?

13:44.644 --> 13:47.478
Oh, no.
They're not all of our...

13:47.480 --> 13:49.380
No, we're still getting
to know each other.

13:49.382 --> 13:52.051
- As if we have a choice.
- Smash, please.

13:53.587 --> 13:55.553
And this is Alice's daughter.

13:55.555 --> 13:59.124
Oh, and for some reason
you've called her Smash.

14:00.526 --> 14:02.593
How delightful.
Who's the rest of the crew?

14:02.596 --> 14:04.430
Crash, Bang and Wallop?

14:06.932 --> 14:08.366
Oh, my...

14:08.368 --> 14:10.135
Well, that is
extraordinary.

14:11.671 --> 14:13.371
You...

14:13.373 --> 14:15.406
You, don't move.

14:17.343 --> 14:18.444
Brilliant.

14:22.482 --> 14:25.216
Oh! And one of the rest of you.

14:25.218 --> 14:27.685
Well, better be getting back
to the old mansion.

14:27.687 --> 14:30.356
Do let me know
if you need, uh...

14:32.257 --> 14:34.291
- Anything?
- Yeah.

14:34.293 --> 14:36.494
That would go there
as a noun, wouldn't it?

14:36.496 --> 14:38.964
Anything.
Anything. Anything.

14:40.400 --> 14:43.667
He seems like
a very interesting fellow.

14:43.669 --> 14:46.472
Shall we? W.

14:49.242 --> 14:50.974
- Anyone?
- Water?

14:50.976 --> 14:53.076
Very good.

15:03.289 --> 15:06.524
Why do you
call her Smash?

15:06.526 --> 15:08.459
Her real name's Samantha.

15:21.174 --> 15:22.573
Excuse me.

15:22.576 --> 15:24.310
Hey.

15:38.658 --> 15:41.091
Hey! Give it back!

15:41.093 --> 15:43.226
- You want it?
- Smash.

15:43.228 --> 15:46.231
Hey! Give that back
now, Samantha!

15:47.601 --> 15:50.336
- Don't call me that.
- Give me that back!

15:51.370 --> 15:53.038
Give it back!

15:59.244 --> 16:00.980
Give it back!

16:09.522 --> 16:11.090
Smash?

16:13.125 --> 16:14.492
Smash, are you all right?!

16:14.494 --> 16:18.796
- Smash?
- It's a tunnel.

16:18.798 --> 16:22.533
- Where does it go?
- Away from you.

16:22.535 --> 16:23.735
We should tell someone.

16:23.737 --> 16:25.536
She... she might get hurt.

16:25.538 --> 16:27.605
- She's got my game.
- Robbie!

16:27.607 --> 16:29.272
Robbie, come back!

16:29.274 --> 16:33.012
- Wait for me!
- Maudie, no. Come back.

16:33.813 --> 16:35.147
Oh...

16:45.525 --> 16:47.393
Maudie!

16:49.562 --> 16:51.163
Maudie!

16:55.535 --> 16:58.504
Maudie! Maudie,
come back!

17:08.381 --> 17:10.082
Give it!

17:14.688 --> 17:17.623
- Poor little Robbie.
- Give it!

17:29.869 --> 17:32.169
Robbie, be careful, just...

17:32.171 --> 17:35.308
- It's dangerous!
- You wanna see dangerous?

17:36.309 --> 17:37.811
Smash, come down!

17:38.844 --> 17:41.146
You're frightening Maudie!

17:46.218 --> 17:49.721
Hey, Robbie Hood. Fetch.

17:49.723 --> 17:51.190
Smash!

17:52.491 --> 17:55.160
Come on, kid.
What you scared of?

18:02.668 --> 18:03.869
Fairy?

18:25.959 --> 18:28.728
It's got my shoe!
It's got my shoe!

18:32.898 --> 18:35.234
Oh, it's got my shoe!

18:58.692 --> 19:00.760
Run, Maudie!
Run to the rocks!

19:01.962 --> 19:03.562
Maudie, come here,
come here, come here.

19:23.849 --> 19:24.918
No!

19:40.366 --> 19:41.600
Here.

19:48.642 --> 19:50.674
It's coming!

20:01.955 --> 20:03.454
Hmm?

20:03.456 --> 20:05.656
What the...?

20:05.659 --> 20:07.391
I can hit it!
Shall I hit it?!

20:07.393 --> 20:11.562
No! Hit her, she's hurting me!

20:11.564 --> 20:13.296
Did it just speak?

20:13.299 --> 20:16.700
Speak? That was
angry shouting.

20:16.702 --> 20:18.870
If I was gonna speak, I would
have said something like,

20:18.872 --> 20:20.804
"Oh! What's that?!"

20:28.914 --> 20:32.816
Fine, you got me.
What do you want?

20:32.818 --> 20:34.518
My sister's shoe.

20:34.520 --> 20:36.353
I don't know
what you're talking about.

20:36.355 --> 20:38.522
You stole it
right off her foot.

20:38.524 --> 20:42.960
Anything that touches this beach
is an offering to the Psammead.

20:42.963 --> 20:46.563
- Psammead?
- Yes, hello.

20:46.565 --> 20:49.399
I'll take most offerings,
I'm not fussy.

20:49.401 --> 20:53.336
I know this. This is from my
book, <i>Five Children and It.</i>

20:53.339 --> 20:56.874
The kids, they find this thing
and it gives them wishes.

20:56.876 --> 21:00.744
One a day, but nothing
longer than a sentence.

21:00.746 --> 21:02.446
But you don't want to wish.

21:02.448 --> 21:04.047
They never work out.

21:04.049 --> 21:06.017
There's consequences.

21:06.019 --> 21:07.518
Something
unfortunate happens,

21:07.520 --> 21:09.721
you blame me,
I get a bad name.

21:09.723 --> 21:11.455
Wishes are bad news.

21:11.457 --> 21:13.857
I wish I was
the best climber in the world.

21:25.771 --> 21:27.138
Was that it?

21:27.140 --> 21:29.473
What do you mean,
"was that it?"

21:29.475 --> 21:30.774
I nearly burst!

21:30.776 --> 21:34.112
So, we make a wish and you,
what, make a fart?

21:34.114 --> 21:37.581
Magic isn't all twinkly lights
and stardust, you know.

21:37.583 --> 21:40.684
Some of us have to work
with enchanted stomach gasses.

21:40.686 --> 21:43.921
Now,
if you'll excuse me.

21:43.924 --> 21:45.989
Wait! Don't go.

21:45.991 --> 21:48.559
Oh, yeah, we wanna wish
for more farts.

21:48.561 --> 21:50.128
I'm sorry,

21:50.130 --> 21:52.996
did I make the granting of
your heart's desire look easy?

21:52.998 --> 21:55.799
Because it isn't!
It's extremely tiring!

21:55.801 --> 21:59.037
- And stinky.
- Hmm...

21:59.039 --> 22:01.405
If you want a dead Psammead
on your hands,

22:01.407 --> 22:04.075
go ahead,
ask for two wishes.

22:04.077 --> 22:07.411
Until then, one a day
is the best I can do.

22:07.413 --> 22:10.948
Come back tomorrow,
if you survive this one.

22:24.598 --> 22:27.433
I want my fairy.

22:31.004 --> 22:32.170
Aww...

22:32.172 --> 22:34.039
Look, it works!

22:36.775 --> 22:38.477
Robbie, be careful!

22:41.114 --> 22:44.082
Hey! Whoa!

22:44.084 --> 22:45.751
Robbie!

22:47.853 --> 22:51.690
These wishes, they can...
There's a catch, I know there is.

22:54.593 --> 22:56.695
Higher! Faster!

22:58.564 --> 23:01.632
Maybe we should go
and look for them.

23:01.635 --> 23:03.867
Maybe we should
stay here and...

23:06.171 --> 23:07.905
No, I think we should
look for them.

23:07.907 --> 23:09.240
I guess that would be

23:09.242 --> 23:11.541
- the responsible thing to do.
- Mmm.

23:11.543 --> 23:13.945
Ooh. Got bars.

23:13.947 --> 23:15.213
Wait one second.

23:15.215 --> 23:16.247
Hello?

23:16.249 --> 23:18.882
No, it's fine. Shoot.

23:18.884 --> 23:20.550
What? Hello?

23:20.552 --> 23:22.920
Can you hear me?
Yes!

23:22.923 --> 23:24.988
Hey, Ros, are you enjoying
the sea air?

23:24.990 --> 23:26.725
Can't talk. Book.

23:36.970 --> 23:39.703
Well, it's nice to see you
running about a bit.

23:39.705 --> 23:41.104
Robbie!

23:41.106 --> 23:43.677
Robbie, get down!
The wish ends at sunset!

23:49.282 --> 23:50.849
Faster!

23:51.850 --> 23:52.851
Higher!

23:54.254 --> 23:56.156
More dangerous!

24:09.568 --> 24:10.971
Robbie, hang on!

24:34.893 --> 24:36.161
Grab the rope!

25:23.043 --> 25:25.276
Oh, my Switch!

25:30.215 --> 25:31.216
Come on, Maudie.

25:34.119 --> 25:35.952
Are you okay?

25:35.955 --> 25:37.157
Yeah, my game's okay.

25:38.924 --> 25:41.793
Oh, for goodness sake.

25:41.795 --> 25:44.761
Get your head
out of that screen, Robbie.

25:44.763 --> 25:46.863
A bit of exercise!

25:46.865 --> 25:48.101
Come on.

25:54.940 --> 25:56.808
You'd think
that he'd mention,

25:56.810 --> 25:59.911
"Oh, and by the way,
the magic wears off at sunset."

25:59.913 --> 26:04.115
- There's dribble on my fairy!
- Oh.

26:32.345 --> 26:35.178
That was pretty
amazing today, right?

26:35.180 --> 26:38.749
I mean, wishes.
Real wishes.

26:38.751 --> 26:40.886
- Have you thought about what you might...
- No.

26:43.423 --> 26:46.089
Fine. You're not
the only one with a phone.

26:46.091 --> 26:48.059
Oh, you call that
a phone?

26:48.061 --> 26:50.761
My dad got mine.
It's the best.

26:50.763 --> 26:53.799
Just like my life will be when he
takes me away from all of this.

27:00.939 --> 27:03.376
Yes! I got a bar!

27:06.211 --> 27:08.081
<i>Look,
I can make films with it.</i>

27:09.815 --> 27:13.186
<i>Here you go.
Your favorite.</i>

27:15.788 --> 27:17.390
<i>Let me get
you two together.</i>

27:19.024 --> 27:20.193
<i>Do a kiss.</i>

27:30.836 --> 27:33.072
<i>Let's see what else that thing
does, shall we?</i>

27:36.775 --> 27:37.977
Okay.

27:41.181 --> 27:42.746
- <i>Hi.</i>
- Dad!

27:42.748 --> 27:44.448
<i>I'm sorry I can't take
your call right now.</i>

27:44.450 --> 27:46.184
<i>Please leave your message
after the tone,</i>

27:46.186 --> 27:47.786
<i>and I'll get back to you
as soon as I...</i>

28:43.176 --> 28:44.542
Looking for someone?

28:44.544 --> 28:48.079
Hey, don't pelt me
with sea barf.

28:48.081 --> 28:50.847
- Sorry, it's a reflex.
- To what?

28:50.849 --> 28:55.052
To foolish children
in search of ill-advised wishes.

28:55.054 --> 28:57.488
Then I got great news
for you, Sammy.

28:57.490 --> 29:00.057
Because this is the best wish
you've ever heard.

29:16.476 --> 29:18.411
Mum?

29:34.027 --> 29:36.027
<i>Ros,
I want you to bring Maudie.</i>

29:36.029 --> 29:37.461
<i>I don't want her
to miss this.</i>

29:37.463 --> 29:39.230
- Miss what?
- <i>You'll find out.</i>

29:39.232 --> 29:40.897
<i>I'm sending someone
to pick you up.</i>

29:40.899 --> 29:42.535
Where from?

29:47.172 --> 29:51.076
Um, Smash said she's
gone out for a nature walk.

29:52.277 --> 29:53.846
What did she really say?

29:55.014 --> 29:58.149
Uh... that she hates
all of us

29:58.151 --> 30:01.284
and we should just
butt out of her life.

30:01.287 --> 30:03.587
That sounds
like my daughter.

30:03.589 --> 30:08.093
No whisk,
so, um... spoon?

30:09.128 --> 30:10.628
Okay.

30:10.630 --> 30:13.930
Anyway, we were just wondering
if maybe we could join her?

30:13.932 --> 30:16.233
That's a funny way
of butting out of her life.

30:16.235 --> 30:18.469
Well, just trying
to make an effort.

30:18.471 --> 30:21.304
Oh, good for you, Ros.
Making new friends, that's nice.

30:21.307 --> 30:23.074
Whoa!

30:26.011 --> 30:28.945
- Oh, are you okay?!
- Yes, yes, yes. No!

30:28.947 --> 30:30.113
Okay, we gotta go.

30:32.652 --> 30:35.952
Has Smash run away again?

30:35.955 --> 30:38.656
No, she just wants us
to take you to her.

30:38.658 --> 30:42.460
- Am I running away too?
- No one's running away.

30:42.462 --> 30:44.428
She's made a wish,
that's all.

30:44.430 --> 30:48.432
She got up early and made a
wish, without telling us.

30:48.434 --> 30:50.636
- What wish?
- I don't know.

30:53.707 --> 30:56.073
Maybe she wished
to be invisible.

30:56.075 --> 30:58.243
Invisible
would be cool.

31:08.321 --> 31:12.325
Huh. Yeah, I don't think
she wished to be invisible.

31:26.339 --> 31:30.410
Maudie! Robbie! Wait!

31:31.511 --> 31:33.246
Wait! Come back!

31:34.380 --> 31:37.517
Maudie!
Where are we going?

31:41.621 --> 31:43.156
Put your seatbelt on!

32:10.450 --> 32:11.451
No.

33:14.447 --> 33:16.213
Robbie.

33:16.215 --> 33:18.115
Maudie.

33:18.117 --> 33:20.083
The other one.

33:20.085 --> 33:22.355
Coco's waiting inside.
Follow me.

33:26.091 --> 33:28.225
Who's Coco?

33:28.227 --> 33:30.227
That's Coco Rayne.

33:30.229 --> 33:34.231
I want shorter there, longer here.
A lot more feathers.

33:34.233 --> 33:36.500
And you, add a cape.

33:36.502 --> 33:38.804
Ah, you made it!

33:42.241 --> 33:45.342
Not long to go now.
You must be so excited!

33:45.344 --> 33:49.346
Confused, mostly.
Where's Smash?

33:49.348 --> 33:51.384
Come with me,
I'll take you to her.

33:53.386 --> 33:56.720
No, of course, none of this
is any surprise to me.

33:56.722 --> 33:59.091
I knew she had it
the moment I first saw her.

34:06.800 --> 34:10.568
Hey, Maudie! Big sis is a star!
What do you think?

34:10.570 --> 34:14.137
Come on,
let's get you into make-up, Maudie.

34:14.139 --> 34:17.206
The new video has got
two billion views.

34:17.208 --> 34:19.811
Smash, you are the
hottest act on the planet.

34:19.813 --> 34:21.545
What about us?

34:21.547 --> 34:23.380
There's some super fans
who won a competition.

34:23.382 --> 34:25.248
- Go stand by them.
- Hey, excuse me.

34:25.250 --> 34:27.687
- Yeah?
- Girls, take a photo. Take a photo.

34:28.853 --> 34:30.824
Yeah.

34:34.527 --> 34:36.760
- Nice. All right, let's go talk to the media.
- Okay.

34:36.762 --> 34:39.362
Okay, don't forget to talk
about your fragrance, okay?

34:39.364 --> 34:40.864
This is forever, Smash.

34:40.866 --> 34:43.434
You could have at least told us
before you just ran off...

34:43.436 --> 34:44.737
Somebody throw
a sheet over that.

34:52.545 --> 34:53.745
Robbie!

34:53.746 --> 34:56.813
- Smash? Maudie?
- Ros?

34:56.815 --> 35:00.451
Yes, where is your
mysterious daughter?

35:00.453 --> 35:03.289
What's she up to, eh?

35:08.728 --> 35:10.429
Mr. Trent?

35:14.768 --> 35:17.701
Oh... Hello!

35:17.703 --> 35:20.604
Well, fancy seeing you here,

35:20.606 --> 35:23.240
on this, uh,
craggy pathway.

35:23.242 --> 35:24.475
What are you doing?

35:24.477 --> 35:27.310
Oh, what, on the...
with the... and the...

35:27.313 --> 35:30.381
I just, uh...
nature survey, actually.

35:30.383 --> 35:34.618
Um, just studying the fauna
and flora of the area.

35:34.620 --> 35:36.587
Oh, there's a bee.

35:36.590 --> 35:38.656
You haven't seen our children, have you?
They seem to have disappeared.

35:38.658 --> 35:40.892
They haven't disappeared,
we just don't know where they've gone.

35:40.894 --> 35:42.426
Which is pretty much
the same thing.

35:42.428 --> 35:43.961
I knew we shouldn't
let them wander off.

35:43.964 --> 35:46.497
David, they're children.
You gotta give 'em some freedom.

35:46.499 --> 35:47.865
Well, I do
give them freedom,

35:47.867 --> 35:50.367
I just tend to be
with them at the time.

35:50.369 --> 35:52.335
Do you know what?
They're gonna be fine.

35:52.338 --> 35:55.272
I grew up here myself, and I was
forever darting off into these moors,

35:55.274 --> 35:56.908
in pursuit of some creature
or another.

35:56.910 --> 35:58.676
Oh, to be young again,

35:58.678 --> 36:03.280
and innocently pulling the
wings off some natural creation.

36:03.282 --> 36:05.248
Tsk.

36:05.250 --> 36:06.417
Here's a thought.

36:06.419 --> 36:08.720
Why don't you and your family

36:08.722 --> 36:11.254
come over
to the mansion tomorrow?

36:11.256 --> 36:12.756
We could all spend
some time together.

36:12.758 --> 36:15.859
Have a little drinky.
Might be rather fun.

36:15.861 --> 36:17.428
Oh, no, we wouldn't
wanna impose.

36:17.430 --> 36:19.731
It's not an imposition!
I insist!

36:19.733 --> 36:22.666
I'd love it. I was never
blessed with children myself,

36:22.668 --> 36:25.536
and I think you can learn
so much from them, can't you?

36:25.538 --> 36:29.540
Well, that's very...
very, very kind of you.

36:29.542 --> 36:31.809
- Thank you.
- So, you'll come?

36:31.811 --> 36:33.747
I'll put it in the pad.
Tomorrow.

36:37.316 --> 36:40.754
Smash! Smash! Smash! Smash!

36:52.331 --> 36:56.900
Um, hello, Smash, maybe we can
stop to talk about how all you...

36:56.902 --> 36:58.736
Let's go. Go, go, go!

36:58.738 --> 37:01.640
Smash!

37:17.523 --> 37:19.757
Who wants to party?!

37:21.927 --> 37:24.663
I said who wants to party?!

37:27.933 --> 37:29.668
This show's for my sister,
Maudie!

37:32.606 --> 37:34.039

No, no, no,
but it hardly started.

38:32.766 --> 38:34.464
No, I want them back!

38:34.466 --> 38:37.100
Oi! How did you
get in here?!

38:37.102 --> 38:38.337
Run!

38:40.005 --> 38:41.407
Run!

38:48.949 --> 38:50.982
This is trash!
I want it back!

38:50.984 --> 38:53.517
I want it...
I want it all back!

38:53.519 --> 38:54.918
You can't.

38:54.920 --> 38:57.721
You have it for a while,
then it's gone.

38:57.723 --> 39:00.123
That's the way it is.

39:00.125 --> 39:02.694
We're gonna be
in so much trouble.

39:02.696 --> 39:05.963
They are going to be
in so much trouble.

39:05.966 --> 39:08.367
I thought we should
give them some freedom?

39:16.942 --> 39:20.777
<i>Passengers are reminded...</i>

39:20.779 --> 39:22.613
Sorry.
Come on, Maudie.

39:22.616 --> 39:24.848
You're so slow!

39:24.850 --> 39:27.218
Smash, have you got any idea
how we're going to get home?

39:27.220 --> 39:29.052
- Hurry up!
- Wait!

39:29.054 --> 39:30.787
<i>The train
service to Penzance</i>

39:30.789 --> 39:33.091
<i>is now standing
at platform eight.</i>

39:33.093 --> 39:34.658
<i>Calling at Reading,
Bristol Parkway...</i>

39:34.660 --> 39:35.927
Hurry up.

39:35.929 --> 39:38.762
- We don't have tickets!
- Just act natural!

39:40.233 --> 39:41.433
Just go on!

39:43.802 --> 39:45.070
Shut the door.

39:47.673 --> 39:49.806
We used to do this
all the time back home,

39:49.808 --> 39:51.174
but the bathrooms
are much bigger there.

39:51.176 --> 39:53.013
Americans have
bigger butts.

40:06.660 --> 40:08.660
Two girls,
both 13 years old,

40:08.662 --> 40:10.494
a boy, nine,
probably with his hood up,

40:10.496 --> 40:11.795
and a five-year-old girl.

40:11.797 --> 40:14.631
You sure they're not
on a nature ramble?

40:14.633 --> 40:16.900
At night? No.

40:16.902 --> 40:18.835
Well, there's a lot
to see at night.

40:18.837 --> 40:20.637
Badgers, owls...

40:20.639 --> 40:23.074
What? David, why is he
asking about owls?

40:23.076 --> 40:24.641
They're not looking at owls.

40:24.643 --> 40:27.080
Are you sure?
Fascinating creatures.

40:29.683 --> 40:32.183
Right. Okay.

40:32.185 --> 40:33.850
It's gonna be okay.

40:33.852 --> 40:37.587
- Now, this is a tawny owl.
- I don't...

40:37.589 --> 40:40.524
I don't want
to look at owls.

40:40.526 --> 40:43.862
I want you to find
our children, please.

40:46.665 --> 40:47.833
You tried ringing them?

40:49.102 --> 40:51.703
Mmm-hmm.
But there's no signal.

40:51.705 --> 40:54.172
There's one up that ladder.

40:54.174 --> 40:57.909
<i>♪ I make a crash
in a flash, I'm... ♪</i>

40:57.911 --> 41:00.777
Forgetting it.

41:00.779 --> 41:02.548
It's my turn
on the seat, move.

41:07.821 --> 41:11.089
You know, none of us
chose this, Smash.

41:11.091 --> 41:12.756
We could at least
try to get along.

41:12.758 --> 41:15.927
Not me. I'm gonna go live
with my dad in the Seychelles.

41:15.929 --> 41:18.229
Yeah,
and what about your mum?

41:18.231 --> 41:22.133
She won't even notice.
All she cares about is her dumb job.

41:25.270 --> 41:27.105
It's your mum!

41:27.107 --> 41:29.240
- What are you gonna tell her?
- That it's your fault.

41:29.242 --> 41:33.044
Hi! Hi, Alice. It's Ros.

41:33.046 --> 41:36.114
Ros, where are you?
Are Maudie and Smash with you?

41:36.116 --> 41:40.083
Um, yes, um, Smash's hand
got stung by a bee,

41:40.085 --> 41:42.619
and it swelled up and we
got taken to a hospital.

41:42.621 --> 41:44.654
What? Hospital?

41:44.657 --> 41:45.957
<i>How'd you get to the hospital?
What happened?</i>

41:45.959 --> 41:47.158
No, we're fine,
we're fine.

41:47.160 --> 41:48.725
Um, they gave her
an injection

41:48.727 --> 41:50.193
and we're just waiting
for the swelling to go down.

41:51.765 --> 41:53.264
Occupied.

41:55.634 --> 41:57.335
That was Smash, yeah.

41:57.337 --> 41:59.603
Which hospital?
We'll come and get you.

41:59.605 --> 42:02.706
Um, the... they're gonna
put us on the train.

42:02.708 --> 42:04.342
<i>You can pick us up
from the station.</i>

42:04.344 --> 42:08.179
A train? Hasn't this country
heard of an ambulance before?

42:08.181 --> 42:09.813
Calm down, calm down, calm...

42:15.821 --> 42:17.323
Where's your mom?

42:19.092 --> 42:21.024
She's at university.

42:21.026 --> 42:24.828
- Oh, your dad cheated on her?
- No, of course not.

42:24.830 --> 42:27.265
She just wanted
to find herself.

42:27.267 --> 42:29.335
Find herself
a long way from you.

42:30.703 --> 42:32.305
Is that why your dad left you?

42:33.772 --> 42:36.740
No. He just got
fed up with my mom,

42:36.742 --> 42:38.211
just like everyone else does.

42:41.981 --> 42:44.818
Daddy's gone to live
with a new lady.

42:47.152 --> 42:51.389
She reeled him in with her
tight, 20-year-old tushy.

42:54.828 --> 42:56.427
<i>We're now approaching St.
Austell.</i>

42:56.429 --> 42:58.131
I think this is our stop.

43:02.801 --> 43:04.938
Tickets, now.

43:14.147 --> 43:15.748
Finally.

43:22.956 --> 43:24.888
Unbelievable.

43:24.890 --> 43:26.289
Totally unbelievable.

43:26.292 --> 43:27.691
I just can't
get my head around it.

43:27.693 --> 43:29.427
I know.
Totally out of control.

43:29.429 --> 43:31.229
I can't believe that Ros and Robbie
would ever do anything like that.

43:31.231 --> 43:33.865
It's just not like them.

43:33.867 --> 43:37.100
Meaning what?
It's all Smash's fault?

43:37.102 --> 43:41.405
Of course not. Although...
they've just never broken the law before.

43:41.407 --> 43:44.207
Well, you never let them
out of your house, David.

43:44.209 --> 43:46.277
I mean, what are they gonna do,
embezzle your rhubarb?

43:46.279 --> 43:48.912
- Let's not argue.
- No, let's argue.

43:48.914 --> 43:50.348
Come on, you have a problem
with my parenting?

43:50.350 --> 43:51.883
I wanna hear
what you have to say.

43:51.885 --> 43:53.451
I... I don't have
a problem with your parenting.

43:53.453 --> 43:55.186
Although, obviously...

43:55.188 --> 43:57.357
Obviously, obviously what?

43:59.058 --> 44:01.058
- Smash has her issues, but...
- Issues?

44:01.060 --> 44:04.495
You said issues.
You told me that she had issue...

44:04.497 --> 44:06.763
Let's... let's just...
let's just forget everything

44:06.765 --> 44:07.864
and just... and move on.

44:07.866 --> 44:09.132
No, no, no. Don't do that,

44:09.134 --> 44:10.834
don't try to smooth
everything over.

44:10.836 --> 44:13.036
- Tell me what you mean.
- I didn't mean anything.

44:13.038 --> 44:14.906
I...
I'm sorry I mentioned it.

44:14.908 --> 44:17.974
I don't want apologies, David.
I wanna know what you feel.

44:17.977 --> 44:19.112
What are you thinking?

45:16.101 --> 45:17.969
Do it again.

45:17.971 --> 45:19.470
I want it again!

45:19.472 --> 45:21.905
I don't do
the same wish twice.

45:23.376 --> 45:25.977
- What are you doing?!
- It's my turn for a wish!

45:25.979 --> 45:29.146
Oh, great, and what lame-o thing
are you gonna ask for? World peace?

45:29.148 --> 45:32.416
World peace? Finally.

45:32.418 --> 45:33.786
No!

45:35.521 --> 45:38.389
Maybe you should wish
to be a famous writer.

45:38.391 --> 45:40.223
Maybe you should wish
yourself up a brain.

45:40.225 --> 45:42.225
Maybe you should wish
yourself up a boyfriend!

45:42.227 --> 45:45.563
Maybe I should wish for the
sweet release of oblivion.

45:45.565 --> 45:49.332
What about two wishes
today, Sammy?

45:49.335 --> 45:52.836
Two wishes a day
is extremely hazardous for me.

45:52.838 --> 45:54.905
If you want two wishes a day,

45:54.907 --> 45:58.609
I suggest you find one of
the two-wish-a-day-Psammeads.

45:58.612 --> 46:01.044
Where are they?

46:01.046 --> 46:02.482
Extinct.

46:10.323 --> 46:12.456
Great, now you
scared him off!

46:12.458 --> 46:14.958
- I scared him off?!
- Yeah, you scared him off!

46:14.960 --> 46:16.359
- I did not scare him off!
- Hey! Stop it!

46:16.362 --> 46:18.298
- I touched you!
- You pushed me!

46:21.635 --> 46:23.436
Good morning.

46:26.905 --> 46:29.042
Do you think
maybe we could not, um...

46:35.080 --> 46:37.948
Can we put
last night behind us?

46:37.950 --> 46:39.417
That's the problem,
isn't it?

46:39.419 --> 46:43.454
Putting things behind us,
pretending everything's okay.

46:43.456 --> 46:45.425
I don't know
if it's gonna work.

46:46.426 --> 46:47.958
What, because I said...

46:47.960 --> 46:50.293
It's not what you said,
it's what you don't say.

46:50.296 --> 46:53.064
I never know what you're
feeling because you're...

46:53.066 --> 46:55.132
You're always
so damn reasonable.

46:55.134 --> 46:58.069
You know, sometimes you just
gotta let it rip.

47:01.174 --> 47:03.407
Do you think that might be
too many raisins?

47:06.245 --> 47:07.679
Yeah, maybe.

47:07.681 --> 47:10.481
Look, I promise

47:10.483 --> 47:16.087
I will... I will try to be
a lot more unreasonable.

47:16.089 --> 47:18.157
- Okay?
- Okay.

47:21.561 --> 47:23.960
Let's give the kids
another chance today,

47:23.963 --> 47:25.663
maybe they'll calm down a bit.

47:25.665 --> 47:27.699
- Yeah.
- You're pushing me.

47:27.701 --> 47:30.033
Ow, stop,
why are you kicking me?

47:30.035 --> 47:31.302
I'm just trying
to walk through the door.

47:31.304 --> 47:32.570
So am I!

47:38.311 --> 47:40.678
This is it.

47:40.680 --> 47:42.079
Dad!

47:43.316 --> 47:45.116
- I was walking!
- Dad, she hit me!

47:45.118 --> 47:46.550
- Oh, sorry for walking.
- Smash, come on, please.

47:46.552 --> 47:48.285
- There's a bruise.
- Oh, there's a bruise?

47:48.287 --> 47:49.520
Yes, there's a bruise.

47:59.031 --> 48:01.432
Welcome.
Welcome to Trent Towers.

48:01.434 --> 48:03.035
Come in, come in.

48:09.242 --> 48:13.076
Well, this is charming.

48:13.078 --> 48:16.079
Oh, uh... I wonder
if I might trouble you

48:16.081 --> 48:19.550
to remove
your outdoor footwear.

48:19.552 --> 48:21.118
- Of course.
- Okay, sweetie.

48:21.120 --> 48:23.721
Would you mind? Awfully?

48:23.723 --> 48:25.224
Shoes.

48:28.227 --> 48:31.128
It's just that
it's a heritage site.

48:31.130 --> 48:32.666
If you don't mind?

48:34.534 --> 48:36.467
Daddy shot that hippo.

48:36.469 --> 48:40.738
An incredible hump.
Put up a real struggle, that beast.

48:42.241 --> 48:44.109
Just pop those there.

48:46.078 --> 48:48.179
So, what do you think?

48:48.181 --> 48:52.383
It's charming, yes.
Really, really charming.

48:52.385 --> 48:55.318
It's old
and kind of worn-looking.

48:55.321 --> 48:56.720
Ahem.

48:56.722 --> 48:59.490
I guess that's
a British thing, right?

48:59.492 --> 49:03.162
Well, it's not Disneyland
but we do our best.

49:04.764 --> 49:09.066
There was a time when the
Trents were kings of the world.

49:09.068 --> 49:12.303
My ancestors
explored the globe,

49:12.305 --> 49:15.506
bravely uncovering
lost civilizations and...

49:15.508 --> 49:18.442
liberating their primitive
knickknacks.

49:18.444 --> 49:23.647
Great-grandpops, he made
his fortune in Africa, then...

49:23.649 --> 49:28.219
blew it all on, well...

49:28.221 --> 49:30.788
let's call it his final quest.

49:30.790 --> 49:34.527
A quest, really?
For, um, what?

49:35.795 --> 49:37.428
Ultimate power.

49:37.430 --> 49:41.298
Riches beyond the dreams
of man. The usual.

49:41.300 --> 49:44.568
It was an obsession
that finally destroyed him,

49:44.570 --> 49:49.174
but which may yet
have a positive outcome.

49:51.477 --> 49:55.412
Do you think I could
perhaps offer you a cocktail?

49:55.414 --> 49:58.181
And give the children
a tour of the house?

49:58.183 --> 50:02.219
Let's leave the adults
to their stuffy entertainment.

50:02.221 --> 50:06.189
I've got some things that I think you'll
find rather intriguing through here.

50:06.191 --> 50:08.259
Come this way, young lady.
Through here.

50:08.261 --> 50:11.663
Now, this is
an absolute gem,

50:11.665 --> 50:14.197
and it's the only one like it
in the world, what's more.

50:14.199 --> 50:18.369
Now, look at some of these genuine marvels.
Don't mind the smell.

50:18.371 --> 50:21.274
Wow. Look at all of this.

50:23.242 --> 50:24.708
What's this do?

50:24.710 --> 50:27.679
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no,
we don't touch that.

50:27.681 --> 50:31.515
- That's not for children is it?
- Cool! Night vision goggles!

50:31.517 --> 50:35.286
Yes, well, plainly
I'm a keen badger enthusiast.

50:35.288 --> 50:39.456
And I like to keep a keen eye
on the goings on of the badger.

50:39.458 --> 50:41.693
They're fascinating creatures,
the badgers.

50:41.695 --> 50:44.862
Do you know they eat their young?
If you're interested.

50:44.864 --> 50:47.164
Ah, now, you'll like this.

50:47.166 --> 50:49.400
This is the last living Dodo.

50:49.402 --> 50:51.368
It looks kinda dead.

50:51.370 --> 50:53.737
Formerly
the last living Dodo.

50:53.739 --> 50:56.574
Don't be pedantic,
it's not an appealing quality in a child.

50:56.576 --> 50:58.309
Uh, come through this way.

50:58.311 --> 51:00.744
- What's this?
- That's from China.

51:00.746 --> 51:04.415
Let go, please.
It's a Tyrannosaur's claw.

51:04.417 --> 51:05.849
Did your family
shoot it, too?

51:05.851 --> 51:09.520
No, but they, they did shoot
the peasant that found it.

51:11.891 --> 51:14.692
Oh... Ah... Ta-ta-ta...

51:14.694 --> 51:17.595
Please, don't touch that.
Come on.

51:17.597 --> 51:20.531
Should be in a borstal.

51:20.533 --> 51:22.834
Now, I've got some real
treats for you in here.

51:22.836 --> 51:25.803
A menagerie of wonderful
beasts and creatures

51:25.805 --> 51:27.905
we've painstakingly preserved.

51:27.907 --> 51:30.776
Natural treasures...

51:36.882 --> 51:39.249
Oh, there you are.

51:39.251 --> 51:42.553
Oh... Where's the toilet?

51:42.555 --> 51:46.492
The water closet is...
it's upstairs on the right.

51:47.493 --> 51:48.926
Okay.

51:48.929 --> 51:53.230
Now, who would like to see
a stuffed elephant?

51:53.232 --> 51:56.900
Formerly endangered,
they're now obviously extinct.

51:56.902 --> 52:00.406
But there are some real
treasures among other things.

52:19.258 --> 52:21.693
Ooh...
Hello there.

52:21.695 --> 52:24.395
Nothing of interest in there
for a young person.

52:24.397 --> 52:26.497
Um, Ros, while I have you
for a moment,

52:26.499 --> 52:29.533
could I just ask...
have you ever been here before?

52:29.535 --> 52:31.969
Or had a relative from here?
A grandmother, perhaps?

52:31.972 --> 52:34.638
- Um, no.
- Curious, um...

52:34.640 --> 52:36.640
Since you've been here,

52:36.642 --> 52:38.776
have you come across
anything unusual?

52:38.778 --> 52:41.979
- Any oddities?
- Um, other than you, you mean?

52:41.982 --> 52:44.848
Well, listen,

52:44.850 --> 52:47.018
if you should see anything
unusual, do let me know.

52:47.020 --> 52:49.488
I'd make it
worth your while.

52:52.626 --> 52:53.925
For example.

52:59.498 --> 53:01.333
Hmm.

53:03.937 --> 53:06.004
Hmm...

53:06.006 --> 53:09.575
Look at these!

53:11.377 --> 53:14.478
Hey, I want to replace your mom.

53:14.480 --> 53:15.713
That's pretty much
how she sees me.

53:15.715 --> 53:17.249
No. No, it's not.

53:18.051 --> 53:19.516
Maybe a little bit.

53:19.518 --> 53:21.454
Here,
let me have a go.

53:23.823 --> 53:27.290
Smash,
I am your stepfather.

53:28.494 --> 53:31.628
We're so revolting.

53:31.630 --> 53:33.564
The Force
is strong with this one.

53:34.868 --> 53:36.333
Forgive me interrupting

53:36.335 --> 53:39.336
your ethnically insensitive
erotica,

53:39.338 --> 53:41.939
but I think I'd rather like
to get on with my afternoon.

53:41.942 --> 53:43.875
- Yes. Oh, sorry.
- Sorry about that.

53:43.877 --> 53:46.980
- Where are the others?
- Oh, we said they could go.

53:48.614 --> 53:50.948
Ros. Ros, we need
to talk to you, darling.

53:50.951 --> 53:53.987
I'll take that,
thank you.

54:15.508 --> 54:17.474
I know Smash
isn't always easy.

54:17.476 --> 54:20.477
She has difficulty
making friends.

54:20.479 --> 54:22.113
Well, with girls, anyways.

54:22.115 --> 54:24.782
So she knows
how to talk to boys?

54:24.784 --> 54:27.753
The wrong sort
of boys, yeah.

54:28.754 --> 54:30.289
Look, Ros...

54:31.357 --> 54:33.024
I just wanna say,

54:33.026 --> 54:35.058
I really care
about your dad.

54:35.060 --> 54:37.661
- So do I.
- I know you do, honey.

54:37.663 --> 54:40.564
Your dad...
he's sweet.

54:40.566 --> 54:44.102
Even when I first crashed
into him, he was just so...

54:44.104 --> 54:46.870
Has he told you this?
How we met?

54:46.872 --> 54:51.575
I crashed into him with my car.
He asked me for my number.

54:51.577 --> 54:53.610
I was like, "Can you believe
this guy?

54:53.612 --> 54:56.647
He's hitting on me
at a road traffic accident."

54:56.650 --> 54:59.650
Turns out it was for insurance,
but I wasn't gonna let him get away

54:59.653 --> 55:01.451
without buying me coffee.

55:01.453 --> 55:05.656
And he wasn't badly hurt,
although his bike was wrecked.

55:05.659 --> 55:08.792
So, Ros...

55:08.794 --> 55:10.594
I guess what I
wanna ask is...

55:10.596 --> 55:13.430
Oh, wait, you have bars!

55:13.432 --> 55:15.799
Do you actually have bars?

55:15.801 --> 55:18.069
It's my mum! My mum! I...

55:18.071 --> 55:20.639
I'll let you guys
be alone.

55:22.876 --> 55:25.843
Mum, is that you?

55:25.845 --> 55:28.782
- It's noisy.
- <i>I'm at a party.</i>

55:29.783 --> 55:31.615
Seriously?

55:31.617 --> 55:33.617
<i>How are you doing out there
with your father?</i>

55:33.619 --> 55:35.919
<i>You getting on
okay with Alice?</i>

55:35.921 --> 55:38.455
You... you know
about her?

55:38.457 --> 55:41.192
<i>Your dad's got to move
on, sweetheart.</i>

55:41.194 --> 55:44.928
Yeah, but, um, I was
actually wondering...

55:44.930 --> 55:46.630
Do you think that maybe
when you've finished

55:46.632 --> 55:49.600
with all the partying
and the studying and stuff,

55:49.603 --> 55:51.903
you might... you might
actually come home?

55:51.905 --> 55:54.137
<i>Ros, we've talked
about this.</i>

55:54.139 --> 55:57.075
- <i>Your dad's a lovely man...</i>
- Yes, he is!

55:57.077 --> 55:59.678
He is a lovely man. I knew
you still liked him.

56:12.826 --> 56:15.492
Ow, that is sharp!

56:15.494 --> 56:19.563
What kind of maniac leaves
a Spinosaurus claw on a beach?

56:19.565 --> 56:22.532
It's supposed to be
a Tyrannosaur.

56:22.534 --> 56:24.801
Excuse me.
I think I know

56:24.803 --> 56:27.038
a Spinosaurus claw
when it stabs me.

56:27.040 --> 56:30.108
It's a very particular
kind of impalement.

56:30.110 --> 56:33.477
- You've met dinosaurs?
- Of course I haven't met dinosaurs!

56:33.479 --> 56:36.748
I hid from dinosaurs or I
wouldn't have survived long enough

56:36.750 --> 56:38.548
to be pestered by you!

56:38.550 --> 56:41.052
Now, the important thing
about dinosaurs is...

56:41.054 --> 56:43.855
Can we have our wish now?
It's Maudie's turn.

56:43.857 --> 56:45.088
Yeah...
Oh, yeah, never mind

56:45.090 --> 56:47.691
about the incredible
prehistoric anecdotes.

56:47.693 --> 56:49.628
"Give us our wish."

56:50.864 --> 56:52.596
What is it this time?

56:52.598 --> 56:55.732
I wish we could all...

57:09.783 --> 57:11.249
You all right, darling?

57:11.251 --> 57:14.918
Um, yeah, I'm just feeling
a bit...

57:14.920 --> 57:16.788
light-headed.

57:16.790 --> 57:19.159
Oh. You know...

57:20.926 --> 57:23.261
Alice is
a really nice person.

57:23.263 --> 57:26.197
I think, you know,
you'll grow to like her.

57:26.199 --> 57:28.467
You just have to
give her a chance, babe.

57:39.945 --> 57:41.645
Hey...

57:41.647 --> 57:44.548
- What are you doing?
- Hugging trees, you know...

57:44.550 --> 57:47.784
I love the wildlife.

57:47.786 --> 57:50.088
Well, why don't I...

57:50.090 --> 57:52.123
give it a hug with you?

57:52.125 --> 57:55.692
Oh, yeah, sure, just...

57:55.694 --> 57:57.195
How am I doing?
All right?

57:57.197 --> 58:00.031
Um, great. Yeah.

58:00.033 --> 58:04.235
You know, Ros,
there's something I want to ask you.

58:04.237 --> 58:06.572
Oh, really?

58:08.241 --> 58:13.910
How would you feel
if Alice... moved in?

58:13.912 --> 58:15.679
With us?

58:15.681 --> 58:17.714
All of us,
living together like,

58:17.716 --> 58:20.283
well, like a new family.
I mean, I know

58:20.286 --> 58:22.120
it'll be a difficult
transition in the beginning,

58:22.122 --> 58:24.322
but what do you think?

58:24.324 --> 58:26.224
Hmm?

58:26.226 --> 58:27.526
Rozzy?

58:30.696 --> 58:31.965
Rozzy?

59:01.061 --> 59:03.228
Maudie!

59:08.201 --> 59:10.902
Ros!

59:10.904 --> 59:13.770
Maudie wished we could fly!
How great is this?!

59:13.772 --> 59:16.339
Dad wants us
to live with Alice.

59:16.342 --> 59:20.243
- Thought so.
- That's all you can say?

59:20.245 --> 59:22.781
It's not like we can do
anything to stop them.

59:37.097 --> 59:38.298
Dad!

01:00:20.739 --> 01:00:23.909
- That's Smash's phone.
- What?

01:00:26.312 --> 01:00:28.945
She got a text from her dad.

01:00:28.947 --> 01:00:33.018
There's no room
for her at... at the moment.

01:00:34.219 --> 01:00:36.753
Big surprise.

01:00:36.755 --> 01:00:39.956
"But how about
I buy you some sneakers."

01:00:39.959 --> 01:00:41.925
- Oh...
- Some sneakers?

01:00:41.927 --> 01:00:43.995
Wow.

01:00:43.997 --> 01:00:46.097
I tried not to let her
get her hopes up.

01:00:46.099 --> 01:00:47.498
- Hey.
- I really tried.

01:00:47.500 --> 01:00:49.866
This way, she stays
with you, with us.

01:00:49.868 --> 01:00:51.234
It's a good thing.

01:00:51.236 --> 01:00:54.105
Yeah, she's
gonna be so excited.

01:01:26.439 --> 01:01:29.340
Ros! There's something
wrong with Smash.

01:01:29.342 --> 01:01:30.343
Come on.

01:01:38.384 --> 01:01:40.119
Smash, stop it!

01:01:53.032 --> 01:01:54.500
I'm okay.

01:02:38.243 --> 01:02:41.312
Why don't you just
leave me alone?

01:02:41.314 --> 01:02:43.283
Oh...

01:02:47.420 --> 01:02:52.358
- You could have killed yourself!
- So what?! Who cares?!

01:02:55.961 --> 01:02:59.230
Even my dad
doesn't want me.

01:02:59.232 --> 01:03:03.200
We want you.
Don't we, Robbie?

01:03:03.202 --> 01:03:06.002
Yeah, you're
all right.

01:04:05.965 --> 01:04:08.267
Ah, there you are.
Just in time.

01:04:10.035 --> 01:04:11.637
Dinner's ready!

01:04:20.714 --> 01:04:22.448
There you go.

01:04:44.970 --> 01:04:47.471
Oh... you found it.

01:04:47.473 --> 01:04:50.040
- We need to talk about that.
- I'll save you the trouble.

01:04:50.042 --> 01:04:52.476
"That was so expensive.
You're so irresponsible.

01:04:52.478 --> 01:04:54.712
What's wrong with you?
Why don't you just disappear, huh?

01:04:54.714 --> 01:04:56.980
Why don't you just become
someone else?"

01:04:56.982 --> 01:04:59.419
- Smash, no.
- I'm gonna give this the funeral it deserves.

01:05:04.658 --> 01:05:08.159
Uh... there's cakes.

01:05:08.161 --> 01:05:10.029
I'll get the cakes. Okay?

01:05:18.538 --> 01:05:21.240
I liked it
when we could fly.

01:05:27.781 --> 01:05:30.414
Hey, you ran away
earlier, darling.

01:05:30.416 --> 01:05:32.616
I think maybe
we should talk about...

01:05:32.618 --> 01:05:34.618
I talked to mum.

01:05:34.620 --> 01:05:36.556
She still likes you,
you know.

01:05:49.134 --> 01:05:51.735
Fly!

01:05:51.737 --> 01:05:53.406
Maudie?

01:06:10.624 --> 01:06:13.791
Imagine if none
of this happened.

01:06:13.793 --> 01:06:17.160
Imagine if your mum
was with your dad...

01:06:17.162 --> 01:06:18.830
they loved each other...

01:06:18.832 --> 01:06:21.534
and they had
enough time for you.

01:06:23.336 --> 01:06:25.769
That won't happen.

01:06:25.771 --> 01:06:29.308
My mom and dad can't even
be on the same continent.

01:06:31.777 --> 01:06:34.245
What if they could?

01:06:34.247 --> 01:06:37.615
We could wish it.
We could wish them together.

01:06:37.617 --> 01:06:40.083
Only for a day.

01:06:40.085 --> 01:06:43.621
What if there's a way
to make a wish last forever?

01:06:43.623 --> 01:06:46.158
It's my turn tomorrow.
I've got an idea.

01:07:18.357 --> 01:07:19.492
It's over.

01:07:20.493 --> 01:07:21.492
What?

01:07:21.494 --> 01:07:23.861
The holiday.

01:07:23.863 --> 01:07:25.697
We've been moving too fast,

01:07:25.699 --> 01:07:28.131
asking you to adjust
too quickly.

01:07:28.133 --> 01:07:29.633
It's not fair.

01:07:29.635 --> 01:07:32.536
So, you can pack your bags
and then we'll go.

01:07:32.538 --> 01:07:34.774
- But... but you can't.
- Pathetic.

01:07:36.375 --> 01:07:38.609
- I thought you were committed.
- We are committed.

01:07:38.612 --> 01:07:41.845
You're gonna let it slide just
'cause your kids act up a bit?

01:07:41.847 --> 01:07:45.382
What did you think we were gonna do?
Hold a jamboree?

01:07:45.384 --> 01:07:47.250
We're supposed to hate you.

01:07:47.252 --> 01:07:49.887
- Don't you know anything?
- Smash, it's not that...

01:07:49.889 --> 01:07:52.389
I'm very disappointed
in your attitude.

01:07:52.391 --> 01:07:53.891
Not you.
But you.

01:07:53.893 --> 01:07:57.463
- I thought you had guts.
- I've got guts.

01:07:59.231 --> 01:08:02.766
Yeah, that's right, Dad,
you tell her.

01:08:02.768 --> 01:08:05.168
If you want something,
then you're gonna take it.

01:08:05.170 --> 01:08:08.305
And if you wanna force your kids
on some awful holiday,

01:08:08.307 --> 01:08:10.374
then you're damn well
going to.

01:08:10.376 --> 01:08:12.443
We need to know
our boundaries.

01:08:12.445 --> 01:08:14.345
You need to find
a way through this,

01:08:14.347 --> 01:08:17.180
because I tell you,
you let us win this one,

01:08:17.182 --> 01:08:18.549
the next time you try
to put us together,

01:08:18.551 --> 01:08:20.718
we're gonna be burning down
bus shelters!

01:08:20.720 --> 01:08:21.886
Yeah!

01:08:23.823 --> 01:08:27.661
You need to take a long,
hard look at yourselves.

01:08:32.866 --> 01:08:34.966
"Burning down
bus shelters"?

01:08:34.968 --> 01:08:36.567
Okay, it was
your boundaries thing.

01:08:36.569 --> 01:08:38.970
I was, like,
"Let's go total delinquent."

01:08:42.508 --> 01:08:47.845
Um, your mum said that you've
had a lot of boyfriends.

01:08:47.846 --> 01:08:50.913
- Did she?
- I was just wondering

01:08:50.916 --> 01:08:53.984
how that whole "getting them
to notice you" thing works.

01:08:53.987 --> 01:08:55.853
Just run up
and hit them on the arm.

01:08:55.854 --> 01:08:57.621
- Really?
- Yeah!

01:08:57.622 --> 01:08:59.857
Boys are the simplest thing
in the world.

01:08:59.859 --> 01:09:01.457
Just don't overthink it.

01:09:01.460 --> 01:09:04.395
Oh, and, uh,
do something about your hair.

01:09:04.397 --> 01:09:06.263
And curly hair helps, too.

01:09:24.984 --> 01:09:27.618
You new type of children
are just so demanding.

01:09:27.621 --> 01:09:29.821
The last ones
were much more considerate.

01:09:29.823 --> 01:09:33.756
Funny you should mention them.
That's who we want to meet.

01:09:33.759 --> 01:09:37.461
We wish to go back in time
and meet the original children,

01:09:37.462 --> 01:09:39.763
the ones from E. Nesbit's book
<i>Five Children and It.</i>

01:09:39.765 --> 01:09:41.965
That's your wish?
I thought you were gonna...

01:09:41.966 --> 01:09:44.568
I just wanna
ask them something.

01:09:44.569 --> 01:09:47.005
Time travel wishes
are dangerous.

01:09:47.006 --> 01:09:49.941
Timelines change,
people stop existing.

01:09:49.943 --> 01:09:53.609
There's always consequences
with time travel. Always.

01:09:53.612 --> 01:09:56.380
- I'm decided.
- Fine.

01:09:56.382 --> 01:09:58.582
Who cares
about reality anyway?

01:10:01.755 --> 01:10:04.354
Wait. What if we wanna
get back?

01:10:04.356 --> 01:10:06.523
You see that shell?

01:10:06.525 --> 01:10:09.393
Blow on that
if you get into bother.

01:10:09.395 --> 01:10:10.894
Is it magic?

01:10:10.896 --> 01:10:13.931
I don't know, one of them is.
Might be that one.

01:10:33.452 --> 01:10:34.553
Gracious.

01:10:35.689 --> 01:10:38.056
You're a rum-looking lot.

01:10:38.058 --> 01:10:40.524
Said the dude
in fancy dress.

01:10:40.526 --> 01:10:44.561
- I beg your pardon?
- Do you speak English?

01:10:44.563 --> 01:10:46.764
She's American.
We're from the future.

01:10:46.766 --> 01:10:48.732
The Psammead sent us
back here to meet you.

01:10:48.734 --> 01:10:51.069
Golly, that's
a cracking wish.

01:10:51.071 --> 01:10:52.804
Perhaps we should wish
to go to your time.

01:10:52.806 --> 01:10:54.471
Not in that getup.

01:10:54.473 --> 01:10:56.642
Says the girl
in the scarecrow costume.

01:10:58.011 --> 01:10:59.246
I'm Cyril.

01:11:01.413 --> 01:11:02.412
Ros.

01:11:02.414 --> 01:11:04.414
And this must be Robert,

01:11:04.416 --> 01:11:06.519
Jane, Anthea and Elam.

01:11:08.121 --> 01:11:10.854
Listen, there was something
we wanted to ask you.

01:11:10.856 --> 01:11:13.423
Is there a way
to make a wish permanent?

01:11:13.425 --> 01:11:15.093
There's something
I really want to ask for,

01:11:15.095 --> 01:11:17.494
but it has to last forever,
not just a day.

01:11:17.496 --> 01:11:20.363
- You mean you don't know yet?
- Tell me.

01:11:20.366 --> 01:11:23.600
That's simple. You just
wish for something else.

01:11:23.602 --> 01:11:26.503
- Something that can...
- Bloody poachers!

01:11:26.505 --> 01:11:29.606
- Scarper!
- Scrumpers! I knew it!

01:11:29.608 --> 01:11:32.476
Scarper!

01:11:32.478 --> 01:11:35.078
Caught ya, boy.

01:11:35.080 --> 01:11:38.049
I didn't steal anything!

01:11:38.051 --> 01:11:40.617
Don't you dare,
don't you dare move your earlobe.

01:11:40.619 --> 01:11:44.488
Ow! Get off of me!
Stop it!

01:11:44.490 --> 01:11:47.959
Ow, let go.
You're hurting me!

01:11:47.961 --> 01:11:51.528
Empty your pockets.
Let's see your loot.

01:11:51.530 --> 01:11:53.831
Let's see what you've stolen from
me, what you have pilfered.

01:11:53.833 --> 01:11:55.667
Come on,
what have you got in there?

01:11:55.669 --> 01:11:58.836
Hop to it. Shell, yes.
That's no interest to me.

01:11:58.838 --> 01:12:00.904
- Hey!
- What's this now?

01:12:03.742 --> 01:12:05.579
What sorcery is this?!

01:12:08.414 --> 01:12:11.983
What are these infernal beasts
trapped within here?

01:12:11.985 --> 01:12:16.019
- See how enraged they are!
- They're angry birds?

01:12:16.021 --> 01:12:17.821
I'm not surprised.

01:12:17.823 --> 01:12:20.958
Trapped for all eternity
in a prison.

01:12:23.529 --> 01:12:26.129
- Hey...
- What are ya?

01:12:26.131 --> 01:12:30.467
A witch? A sorcerer?
A necromancer?

01:12:30.469 --> 01:12:32.870
A leprechaun?
A Frenchman?

01:12:32.872 --> 01:12:34.872
Whatever it is you are,

01:12:34.874 --> 01:12:38.508
I'll wager
you're highly collectable.

01:12:38.510 --> 01:12:42.145
- A real treasure.
- Please, I'm a girl.

01:12:42.147 --> 01:12:43.949
The Psammead
brought us here.

01:12:44.950 --> 01:12:46.884
Psammead?

01:12:46.886 --> 01:12:49.220
Well, who's this Psammead?

01:12:49.222 --> 01:12:51.089
I don't know, it's...
it's not a person.

01:12:51.091 --> 01:12:54.157
It's just this thing
that gives us wishes.

01:12:54.159 --> 01:12:56.828
Interesting.

01:12:56.830 --> 01:13:01.533
And where might I find this
magical wish-granting entity?

01:13:02.568 --> 01:13:04.838
Tell me! Tell me!

01:13:08.574 --> 01:13:10.809
I shan't be asking you again.

01:13:14.079 --> 01:13:15.916
You got that right!

01:13:34.500 --> 01:13:36.835
Ros! Come on!

01:13:38.238 --> 01:13:40.704
Robbie! How did you...

01:13:40.706 --> 01:13:43.206
Smash got Cyril to go back
and see the Psammead.

01:13:43.208 --> 01:13:45.842
And I wished for us
to have superpowers!

01:13:45.844 --> 01:13:48.845
I've got x-ray vision,
so I can see through walls.

01:13:48.847 --> 01:13:50.647
That's how we found you.

01:13:50.649 --> 01:13:53.750
Maudie's telekinetic,
and Smash has super strength.

01:13:53.752 --> 01:13:54.818
And you've got...

01:13:55.989 --> 01:13:59.022
Laser eyes.
Cool.

01:14:11.705 --> 01:14:13.572
This is a wheeze!

01:14:27.120 --> 01:14:29.020
We have to get out of here,
right now.

01:14:29.022 --> 01:14:30.321
The Psammead's in danger.

01:14:30.323 --> 01:14:32.758
Come on, this is fun.

01:14:35.561 --> 01:14:38.198
You see that? That's Tristan's
great-grandfather over there.

01:14:40.065 --> 01:14:42.100
Once he's seen all this,
he's going to spend the rest of his life

01:14:42.102 --> 01:14:43.867
hunting down the Psammead.

01:14:43.869 --> 01:14:47.170
That was his life's quest,
and I just handed it to him.

01:14:47.172 --> 01:14:49.340
Our Tristan's
hunting him, too!

01:14:49.342 --> 01:14:51.910
Then I guess we ought to do
something about that.

01:15:05.724 --> 01:15:06.860
Where's the Psammead?

01:15:08.228 --> 01:15:09.695
There!

01:15:14.367 --> 01:15:15.969
My offerings!

01:15:17.370 --> 01:15:19.139
My offerings!

01:15:22.075 --> 01:15:24.776
Oh, my gosh.
It's true.

01:15:24.778 --> 01:15:27.212
The legend is true.

01:15:30.316 --> 01:15:32.984
Leave this to me.
Smash power!

01:15:32.986 --> 01:15:34.851
- Smash!
- Ow, ow.

01:15:34.853 --> 01:15:37.288
That wish expired
about a hundred years ago.

01:15:37.290 --> 01:15:38.958
Come on!

01:15:42.027 --> 01:15:43.063
Maudie!

01:15:44.064 --> 01:15:45.897
- Stop! Stop it!
- Stop!

01:15:45.899 --> 01:15:48.765
Out of the way!
The creature's mine!

01:15:48.767 --> 01:15:51.702
- Try and make us!
- Oh, okay then!

01:15:53.238 --> 01:15:54.239
Come on!

01:16:12.425 --> 01:16:13.692
Huh...

01:16:17.696 --> 01:16:19.796
Oh, run, Maudie, run!

01:16:27.072 --> 01:16:28.741
Oh, this is
really helping.

01:16:35.080 --> 01:16:36.216
To the tunnel!

01:16:50.864 --> 01:16:52.964
My beautiful offerings!
Take me back!

01:16:52.966 --> 01:16:54.398
Didn't we just rescue you?

01:16:54.400 --> 01:16:56.167
Oh, well, that...
that was rescuing, was it?

01:16:56.169 --> 01:16:58.236
I'm sorry, I thought you
were trying to kill me.

01:16:58.238 --> 01:17:00.003
If you have a problem
with our rescuing,

01:17:00.005 --> 01:17:02.073
then maybe you should have
magicked yourself out of it!

01:17:02.075 --> 01:17:05.245
- I can't do magic on myself.
- Well, that sucks.

01:17:11.850 --> 01:17:14.986
Hey! You! I'm stuck!

01:17:14.988 --> 01:17:18.256
We'll tell the coastguard
in a couple of days!

01:17:18.258 --> 01:17:19.490
Maybe a week!

01:17:23.363 --> 01:17:26.131
I am really sorry
about your beach.

01:17:28.301 --> 01:17:32.235
- It's not your fault.
- Well, actually...

01:17:32.237 --> 01:17:35.907
you know that whole
going-back-in-time thing

01:17:35.909 --> 01:17:42.446
may kind have been what made the
Trents obsessed with hunting you down.

01:17:42.448 --> 01:17:46.450
Oh. Oh, I see.

01:17:46.452 --> 01:17:49.953
Gosh, you must feel
so awful about that.

01:17:49.955 --> 01:17:51.855
Look, don't worry.

01:17:51.857 --> 01:17:55.393
Seriously, I was thinking
of moving on anyway.

01:17:55.395 --> 01:17:58.396
- Really?
- No, not really!

01:17:58.398 --> 01:18:01.064
I've lived on that beach
for a hundred million years.

01:18:01.066 --> 01:18:03.767
It's survived global floods,
two ice ages,

01:18:03.769 --> 01:18:07.138
and a comet which wiped out
most of the life on earth.

01:18:07.140 --> 01:18:10.041
But apparently,
it couldn't survive you!

01:18:10.043 --> 01:18:12.443
I'll... I'll make it
up to you.

01:18:21.854 --> 01:18:23.421
Wow!

01:18:23.423 --> 01:18:25.323
- That actually looks edible.
- Hey!

01:18:26.326 --> 01:18:27.824
Hitting is unacceptable.

01:18:27.826 --> 01:18:29.192
I can be very, very,

01:18:29.194 --> 01:18:31.864
very unreasonable about it.

01:18:33.799 --> 01:18:36.334
Those kids never finished
telling you what you wanted.

01:18:36.336 --> 01:18:40.303
How to make a wish last forever?
I worked that out.

01:18:40.306 --> 01:18:43.306
The Psammead's wishes
always end at sunset.

01:18:43.309 --> 01:18:46.410
But what if we wish
for something else?

01:18:46.412 --> 01:18:50.581
What if we wish for something
that could make permanent magic?

01:18:50.584 --> 01:18:52.751
Like another Psammead?

01:18:54.119 --> 01:18:56.153
No.

01:18:56.155 --> 01:18:57.888
I'm more thinking an app

01:18:57.890 --> 01:19:00.857
that makes people
fall in love forever.

01:19:00.859 --> 01:19:03.026
Puts everything back
as it was.

01:19:03.028 --> 01:19:06.530
So, the app
disappears at sunset,

01:19:06.532 --> 01:19:08.965
but then both our parents
are still together!

01:19:08.968 --> 01:19:11.034
Ros, you're awesome.

01:19:11.036 --> 01:19:14.540
Thanks.
You're pretty okay, too.

01:19:16.610 --> 01:19:18.511
How are we gonna
sneak him in?

01:19:23.483 --> 01:19:25.985
Wait, stop. I think
I heard something.

01:19:36.195 --> 01:19:37.330
Um...

01:19:54.480 --> 01:19:59.385
Hmm. There's a startling
lack of, uh, sand.

01:20:02.121 --> 01:20:04.457
Eh...
I'll get the buckets.

01:20:09.362 --> 01:20:11.128
Dad says you spoke to Mum.

01:20:11.130 --> 01:20:13.564
Yeah, she's doing
really well, you know.

01:20:13.566 --> 01:20:16.233
I think this university stuff's
just a temporary thing.

01:20:16.235 --> 01:20:19.337
- She still really likes...
- Stop. Just don't.

01:20:19.339 --> 01:20:22.540
She's had to make a lot of
very difficult choices, Robbie.

01:20:22.542 --> 01:20:24.608
It's not like any
of this is straightforward.

01:20:24.610 --> 01:20:26.644
- And then there's...
- That's dad talking.

01:20:26.646 --> 01:20:29.515
She left us, Ros.
She left us.

01:20:41.060 --> 01:20:43.294
Oh, okay, it's ice cream.

01:20:43.296 --> 01:20:44.662
Say it in...
say it in a British...

01:20:44.664 --> 01:20:48.065
You go <i>ice cream!</i>

01:20:48.067 --> 01:20:49.132
What do you think?

01:20:49.134 --> 01:20:50.568
Well, it's not on fire,

01:20:50.570 --> 01:20:52.704
so I guess it's good.

01:20:52.706 --> 01:20:55.306
This has never happened
before, trust me.

01:20:55.308 --> 01:20:58.642
- Now say water bottle.
- Water bottle.

01:20:58.644 --> 01:21:00.678
Water bottle.

01:21:00.680 --> 01:21:02.380
- What was that?
- Oh, just me.

01:21:03.949 --> 01:21:06.149
It sounded
like it was upstairs.

01:21:07.286 --> 01:21:09.086
Oh, actually,
you know what?

01:21:09.088 --> 01:21:13.023
I am tired and would like to go
upstairs to do some sleeping.

01:21:13.025 --> 01:21:15.959
I'm also very tired too,
so, yeah, I should turn in.

01:21:15.961 --> 01:21:19.064
Oh, me too. I'm really tired.
Thank you.

01:21:20.400 --> 01:21:21.998
What's going on?

01:21:22.001 --> 01:21:24.101
There's a sand monster
in the bath.

01:21:24.103 --> 01:21:25.505
It's mean, but we love it.

01:21:28.273 --> 01:21:29.409
Oh...

01:21:35.248 --> 01:21:36.516
Oh!

01:21:38.284 --> 01:21:39.485
Offerings.

01:21:41.354 --> 01:21:45.224
We seriously have to find it
a new place to live.

01:21:47.059 --> 01:21:48.528
Do you think it's the tart?

01:21:50.129 --> 01:21:51.294
There's no way it's the tart.

01:21:51.297 --> 01:21:53.431
- The tart's amazing.
- Yeah?!

01:21:53.433 --> 01:21:55.433
Yeah.

01:21:55.435 --> 01:21:57.334
Actually, do you think
I should check on them?

01:21:57.336 --> 01:21:58.602
Oh, no.
They're up to stuff

01:21:58.604 --> 01:22:00.237
they don't want us
to know about.

01:22:00.239 --> 01:22:02.141
It's like we're
a real family already.

01:22:24.764 --> 01:22:27.232
Mmm... Mm...

01:22:33.072 --> 01:22:34.638
It has to be
one sentence.

01:22:34.640 --> 01:22:36.474
It is, these are
semicolons.

01:22:36.476 --> 01:22:40.211
Wow, a use for punctuation.
Who knew?

01:22:40.213 --> 01:22:43.346
You know, if it's too vague or
if there's holes in it, then...

01:22:43.349 --> 01:22:45.817
It's not.
It's watertight.

01:22:45.819 --> 01:22:48.552
Tomorrow everything will go
back to how it should be.

01:22:48.554 --> 01:22:51.088
Our real parents
back together.

01:22:51.090 --> 01:22:54.124
Not just together.
In love, forever.

01:22:54.126 --> 01:22:56.193
Will be like
we never even met.

01:23:19.318 --> 01:23:22.054
It was my favorite
when I was her age.

01:23:30.630 --> 01:23:33.566
Tell her you got it, though. I don't
want her to think I'm trying to buy her.

01:23:35.234 --> 01:23:39.803
Four children.
Double trouble.

01:23:39.805 --> 01:23:41.705
Do you think we can handle it?

01:23:41.707 --> 01:23:43.474
What's life
without a challenge?

01:23:43.476 --> 01:23:45.144
Really peaceful.

01:23:47.480 --> 01:23:51.214
Oh... I can't wait to see
them grow and blossom.

01:23:51.216 --> 01:23:53.116
Yeah, maybe.

01:23:53.118 --> 01:23:54.818
I wish that they'd
never grow...

01:23:54.820 --> 01:23:57.323
Do not complete
that sentence!

01:24:01.427 --> 01:24:03.228
Hey, you're
supposed to be asleep!

01:24:04.764 --> 01:24:07.232
Oh, Smash, I, uh...

01:24:09.335 --> 01:24:10.503
fixed your phone.

01:24:11.537 --> 01:24:14.106
Uh, thanks.

01:24:15.341 --> 01:24:17.711
It's not as flashy
as it was before but...

01:24:18.912 --> 01:24:21.514
But it works.
That's what counts, right?

01:24:24.584 --> 01:24:25.851
Yeah.

01:24:30.189 --> 01:24:31.390
All right.

01:24:35.160 --> 01:24:36.862
Okay, girls,
go back to sleep now.

01:25:09.462 --> 01:25:11.196
Sunrise.

01:25:12.632 --> 01:25:14.734
Smash, wake up.
The wish.

01:25:15.901 --> 01:25:17.837
Mmm.

01:25:22.676 --> 01:25:24.976
Stop! No!

01:25:24.978 --> 01:25:27.681
Girls? Girls,
what's going on in there?

01:25:31.617 --> 01:25:35.486
- Why are you wet?
- Um, I...

01:25:35.488 --> 01:25:39.691
Sorry, did we
wake you getting showered?

01:25:39.693 --> 01:25:42.292
This holiday
is just so great.

01:25:42.294 --> 01:25:44.996
- Why sleep through it, right?
- Yeah, yeah.

01:25:44.998 --> 01:25:49.400
We just thought we should make an
early start and see the sun come up.

01:25:49.402 --> 01:25:50.934
Do you know what?

01:25:50.936 --> 01:25:54.838
That is a brilliant idea.
Let's do it.

01:25:54.840 --> 01:25:58.810
Let's start the day.
Let's have breakfast on the beach!

01:25:58.812 --> 01:26:00.346
What?

01:26:02.816 --> 01:26:03.849
Ros...

01:26:05.451 --> 01:26:08.485
let's have a bit
of human interaction today.

01:26:08.487 --> 01:26:09.855
Leave the books
behind, all right?

01:26:25.471 --> 01:26:26.772
Them.

01:26:28.374 --> 01:26:29.973
- No!
- Come on,

01:26:29.975 --> 01:26:32.311
if you can rescue a Psammead,
you can do this.

01:26:39.853 --> 01:26:40.954
Ooh.

01:26:45.991 --> 01:26:47.426
Eh...

01:27:21.560 --> 01:27:25.096
You got this. You'll be so cool.
Just do it.

01:27:25.098 --> 01:27:26.396
Ow!

01:27:26.398 --> 01:27:28.066
What are you doing, psycho?

01:27:28.068 --> 01:27:30.601
- I'm sorry, I...
- No.

01:27:30.604 --> 01:27:32.070
You've got issues.

01:27:32.072 --> 01:27:35.341
I... I don't know
what came over me.

01:27:37.643 --> 01:27:39.980
So, do you want
to get an ice cream?

01:28:04.503 --> 01:28:06.872
Okay, girls. Time to go.

01:28:11.011 --> 01:28:12.678
Ah...

01:28:22.856 --> 01:28:24.890
Huh?

01:28:29.461 --> 01:28:31.162
Ah...

01:28:41.006 --> 01:28:42.874
Hey!

01:28:42.876 --> 01:28:44.978
I wanna...
I wanna see more photos.

01:28:49.849 --> 01:28:52.516
What's so funny?

01:28:52.518 --> 01:28:53.787
Door's open.

01:29:00.961 --> 01:29:03.161
- We've been robbed!
- What the...?

01:29:14.174 --> 01:29:15.674
Tristan.

01:29:19.478 --> 01:29:22.446
- Ros!
- Tell my dad I've gone for a walk.

01:29:22.448 --> 01:29:23.647
No, I'm coming, too.

01:29:23.649 --> 01:29:26.450
No, just, go away, okay?
This is my mess.

01:29:26.452 --> 01:29:28.485
If I hadn't made that stupid
time-travel wish,

01:29:28.487 --> 01:29:29.821
none of this
would have happened.

01:29:29.823 --> 01:29:31.054
I have to sort it out.

01:29:31.056 --> 01:29:34.092
No, you don't.
We do.

01:29:34.094 --> 01:29:36.462
This is our mess, too.

01:29:38.031 --> 01:29:39.963
Fine, just, come on then.

01:29:39.965 --> 01:29:42.599
It'll be pretty easy
to get in.

01:29:42.601 --> 01:29:44.067
We can force
a window or something.

01:29:44.069 --> 01:29:45.739
I mean, the place
is pretty run down.

01:29:52.012 --> 01:29:53.747
Whoa.

01:29:56.882 --> 01:29:57.983
Get off!

01:29:59.184 --> 01:30:01.186
Get off of me!

01:30:04.124 --> 01:30:05.889
Welcome!

01:30:05.891 --> 01:30:08.894
I knew you wouldn't
be able to resist!

01:30:09.995 --> 01:30:13.031
Well... what do you think?

01:30:13.033 --> 01:30:14.998
Dazzling, isn't it?

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:17.035
When do the fashion police
get here?

01:30:17.037 --> 01:30:19.002
You might still
have time to run.

01:30:21.274 --> 01:30:22.676
Bring them to me.

01:30:24.277 --> 01:30:27.644
But I suppose I do owe you
a debt of gratitude.

01:30:27.646 --> 01:30:29.615
<i>Une</i> French Fancy?

01:30:31.284 --> 01:30:33.216
The only thing we want
is the Psammead.

01:30:33.218 --> 01:30:36.753
- Where is he?
- Psammead?

01:30:36.755 --> 01:30:40.824
Psammead, Psammead,
Psammead, Psammead.

01:30:42.262 --> 01:30:44.761
Psammead...

01:30:44.763 --> 01:30:46.898
Oh!

01:30:46.900 --> 01:30:49.970
You mean
my latest acquisition!

01:30:53.006 --> 01:30:55.541
- What have you done to him?
- Nothing!

01:30:56.575 --> 01:30:58.810
Couple of mild
electric shocks.

01:30:58.812 --> 01:31:01.745
Nothing that would trouble
the Geneva Convention.

01:31:01.747 --> 01:31:03.246
It's a bit of a wuss,
to be honest with you.

01:31:03.248 --> 01:31:05.183
Let him go.

01:31:05.185 --> 01:31:08.086
- He's given you everything that you want.
- This?

01:31:08.088 --> 01:31:11.855
This isjust the beginning.
First thing I thought of.

01:31:11.857 --> 01:31:15.592
Plush pad,
purple lady army, velvet.

01:31:15.594 --> 01:31:19.164
And it's refusing
to give me any more. Hmm?

01:31:39.585 --> 01:31:42.719
<i>Please...</i>

01:31:42.721 --> 01:31:45.722
- <i>I can't.</i>
- Do you see?

01:31:45.724 --> 01:31:50.095
I need you kids
to help me change its mind.

01:31:51.364 --> 01:31:53.096
It won't listen to us.

01:31:53.098 --> 01:31:56.199
It can only do one wish a day.
Any more is dangerous for him.

01:31:56.201 --> 01:31:57.235
He could hurt himself.

01:31:57.237 --> 01:31:58.802
Oh, Ros, my dear child.

01:31:58.804 --> 01:32:01.172
I don't need you
to talk to it.

01:32:01.174 --> 01:32:06.144
I need you here
so that I can change its mind.

01:32:06.146 --> 01:32:07.981
Get off my sister!

01:32:09.014 --> 01:32:10.549
<i>Please don't hurt them.</i>

01:32:11.917 --> 01:32:16.254
Well, that's rather
up to you, isn't it?

01:32:16.256 --> 01:32:20.326
More wishes, please.

01:32:21.995 --> 01:32:24.027
<i>Very well.</i>

01:32:24.029 --> 01:32:27.766
<i>If you must.
Make a wish.</i>

01:32:28.867 --> 01:32:30.001
I wish that...

01:32:30.003 --> 01:32:33.304
Ah! Very good, very good!

01:32:33.306 --> 01:32:35.173
Nearly got me there.
Shoot that one first.

01:32:36.342 --> 01:32:37.710
<i>Stop.</i>

01:32:39.712 --> 01:32:44.315
<i>Take your wish, Tristan Trent.
It will be your last.</i>

01:32:44.317 --> 01:32:46.149
Yes, yes.
Spare me the platitudes.

01:32:46.151 --> 01:32:48.952
Gold!

01:32:48.954 --> 01:32:51.354
I wish for gold, creature.

01:32:51.357 --> 01:32:54.327
Beyond the dreams of man.

01:33:14.414 --> 01:33:16.615
Where's my gold?

01:33:41.774 --> 01:33:46.344
Children...
you have to...

01:33:46.346 --> 01:33:48.880
you-you-you have to...

01:33:55.889 --> 01:33:59.157
It's okay, Psammead.
We'll take care of you.

01:33:59.159 --> 01:34:03.396
No. You have to leave.

01:34:04.464 --> 01:34:05.664
Now.

01:34:07.933 --> 01:34:11.271
Ooh, yeah.

01:34:41.334 --> 01:34:42.968
Help!

01:35:22.375 --> 01:35:24.477
Poor sand monster.

01:35:28.213 --> 01:35:31.417
Sammy? Sammy!

01:35:32.552 --> 01:35:36.089
No. No. No...

01:35:40.460 --> 01:35:42.460
Robbie, Robbie, stop.

01:35:42.462 --> 01:35:44.595
No. No...

01:35:44.598 --> 01:35:47.166
I... I can't.

01:35:51.104 --> 01:35:52.969
I can't.

01:36:26.406 --> 01:36:28.441
Shoe sand, yum, yum.

01:36:31.311 --> 01:36:33.379
Maudie.

01:36:35.348 --> 01:36:37.348
Sand monster's hungry.

01:37:01.307 --> 01:37:03.042
Do you mind?

01:37:30.203 --> 01:37:31.435
<i>Careful.</i>

01:37:31.437 --> 01:37:33.270
You're gonna love
this new beach.

01:37:33.272 --> 01:37:35.475
- What's the sand like?
- Be quiet.

01:37:37.477 --> 01:37:39.610
Shh.

01:37:39.613 --> 01:37:42.415
Oh...
I'll take that.

01:37:50.189 --> 01:37:51.589
Okay, let's go.

01:37:51.591 --> 01:37:53.391
Last day, let's make
the most of it.

01:37:53.393 --> 01:37:56.394
I can take your bag
for you. Yeah.

01:37:56.396 --> 01:37:57.963
Thank you!

01:37:59.432 --> 01:38:02.034
I think
I'm sitting on a snorkel.

01:38:05.270 --> 01:38:06.604
Ow!

01:38:06.606 --> 01:38:08.207
- Oh!
- Sorry!

01:38:23.022 --> 01:38:24.488
Mind your head.

01:38:24.490 --> 01:38:26.690
All right.

01:38:26.692 --> 01:38:28.492
Hurry!

01:38:28.494 --> 01:38:31.362
Girls! What's that?
Where are you going?

01:38:31.364 --> 01:38:33.597
What's that?!

01:38:33.599 --> 01:38:35.601
It's just a shell, baby.

01:38:39.539 --> 01:38:41.439
See?

01:38:41.441 --> 01:38:43.142
Okay, I'm over it now.

01:38:44.177 --> 01:38:45.711
Okay.

01:38:56.656 --> 01:38:57.990
Hmm...

01:39:17.042 --> 01:39:19.142
Good grain.

01:39:19.144 --> 01:39:21.146
That's quality.

01:39:37.062 --> 01:39:38.830
So, this will do?

01:39:38.832 --> 01:39:41.131
Oh, yes.
I'm digging deep.

01:39:41.133 --> 01:39:46.069
No one's finding me for another
hundred years, if I have any luck.

01:39:46.071 --> 01:39:48.539
Now, if you'll excuse me.

01:39:48.541 --> 01:39:51.809
- Wait!
- Our final wish.

01:39:51.811 --> 01:39:56.449
Okay, for the last time.
Wish me.

01:39:58.351 --> 01:40:01.387
So... you're really
gonna do it then?

01:40:02.656 --> 01:40:05.389
Yeah, our mum and dad
back together.

01:40:05.391 --> 01:40:07.527
Robbie, don't you want
to be happy?

01:40:16.335 --> 01:40:19.169
"We wish to create a mobile
phone application..."

01:40:19.171 --> 01:40:20.504
Mmm?

01:40:20.506 --> 01:40:22.273
"...hereafter referred to
as an app..."

01:40:22.275 --> 01:40:24.441
- Ros...
- What?

01:40:24.443 --> 01:40:27.845
Why is your shoe flashing?

01:40:27.847 --> 01:40:30.313
I don't know, but...

01:40:30.316 --> 01:40:33.316
Where is it? Eh?

01:40:33.319 --> 01:40:35.254
- Where is it?
- I don't...

01:40:40.694 --> 01:40:42.696
I have a signal!

01:40:43.763 --> 01:40:45.765
Yay, we have a signal.

01:40:47.132 --> 01:40:50.167
Okay...

01:40:50.169 --> 01:40:54.507
Two-hundred and eighty-seven emails.
Nineteen voicemails.

01:41:00.580 --> 01:41:03.380
I'm on vacation.

01:41:10.356 --> 01:41:12.656
Is that...?
Hang on.

01:41:18.564 --> 01:41:20.531
- Show me to its nest.
- Ow!

01:41:20.533 --> 01:41:22.700
Where it does its business!

01:41:22.702 --> 01:41:25.369
Take me to its lair!
Its dwelling place!

01:41:25.371 --> 01:41:28.840
What are you doing?!

01:41:28.842 --> 01:41:31.174
- What's going on?
- Stinking...

01:41:31.176 --> 01:41:32.910
- What's going on?!
- Stay out of this, this doesn't concern you.

01:41:32.913 --> 01:41:34.846
It's between me
and these children.

01:41:34.848 --> 01:41:37.481
Hang on a minute. Just calm down.
I'm sure we can all...

01:41:37.483 --> 01:41:38.682
Yeah, I think
you should calm down.

01:41:38.684 --> 01:41:39.751
Let me carry out
my investigation.

01:41:39.753 --> 01:41:40.784
Mr. Trent, be reasonable.

01:41:40.786 --> 01:41:42.285
I'm being reasonable!

01:41:42.288 --> 01:41:44.622
I've not shot them
or flogged them, have I?

01:41:44.624 --> 01:41:47.891
Now why don't you toddle off into
the dunes with your American tart,

01:41:47.893 --> 01:41:49.693
and let me take care
of business?

01:41:52.298 --> 01:41:54.531
You keep your hands
off my family!

01:41:54.533 --> 01:41:56.266
Alice, phone the police.

01:41:56.268 --> 01:41:59.739
Oh, yes. Um, well,
I have a phone, too.

01:42:00.906 --> 01:42:02.475
Four bars.

01:42:09.415 --> 01:42:11.283
Ros, stop.

01:42:12.418 --> 01:42:15.687
No, Ros, no.

01:42:15.689 --> 01:42:19.224
But the wish, I...
I never made the wish!

01:42:20.926 --> 01:42:23.763
It was just here.
It can't have gone far.

01:42:25.765 --> 01:42:27.933
Why aren't you helping me?!

01:42:29.268 --> 01:42:31.368
It... it's gone, Ros.

01:42:31.370 --> 01:42:34.605
No. I want it back.
I want it back!

01:42:34.608 --> 01:42:36.275
Let it go.

01:42:39.779 --> 01:42:41.612
Well, I... I don't know
about anyone else,

01:42:41.615 --> 01:42:44.383
but I'm still looking forward
to hearing this ludicrous wish.

01:42:51.657 --> 01:42:54.558
We wish...

01:42:54.560 --> 01:42:56.429
Can they say
goodbye first?

01:43:02.736 --> 01:43:04.970
We had a good time,
didn't we?

01:43:06.472 --> 01:43:08.207
We had the best.

01:43:13.579 --> 01:43:15.681
But I don't
wanna say goodbye.

01:43:16.816 --> 01:43:20.319
But we have to, Maudie.
We have to.

01:43:28.294 --> 01:43:29.930
I wish...

01:43:33.033 --> 01:43:34.467
I wish...

01:43:48.447 --> 01:43:49.950
I wish...

01:43:56.655 --> 01:44:00.692
I wish that you have a long,
peaceful sleep in the sand,

01:44:00.694 --> 01:44:04.363
and no one disturbs you for at
least another hundred years.

01:44:05.564 --> 01:44:07.933
Maybe there's hope for you yet.

01:44:12.938 --> 01:44:16.673
- Goodbye, Psammead.
- Bye, Psammead.

01:44:16.675 --> 01:44:18.444
Thanks for the horrible wishes.

01:44:19.745 --> 01:44:21.411
Well, goodbye, children.

01:44:21.413 --> 01:44:22.916
It's been awful knowing you.

01:44:24.084 --> 01:44:26.752
Bye-bye, sand monster.

01:44:31.056 --> 01:44:32.626
See you never.

01:44:34.593 --> 01:44:36.962
That I can promise.

01:44:52.611 --> 01:44:53.945
And just the way
he was behaving.

01:44:53.947 --> 01:44:55.512
Don't... don't... now,
don't arrest me.

01:44:55.514 --> 01:44:57.749
There's been a misunderstanding.
Un-arrest me.

01:44:57.751 --> 01:45:00.584
Arrest them!
If you're gonna arrest anybody.

01:45:00.586 --> 01:45:03.054
He struck me, she's American,

01:45:03.056 --> 01:45:05.455
they destroyed my house
with a magical sand thing!

01:45:05.457 --> 01:45:08.360
It decimated my mansion!
It's in ruins!

01:45:12.731 --> 01:45:13.967
Kids?

01:45:15.100 --> 01:45:17.035
Are you all right?

01:45:17.037 --> 01:45:19.636
We're fine.

01:45:19.638 --> 01:45:21.540
We're all completely fine.

01:46:46.159 --> 01:46:48.994
- There you go.
- Thank you.

01:46:51.730 --> 01:46:53.897
I wish I could be
a writer one day.

01:46:53.899 --> 01:46:57.102
Well, you're never too old
for wishes, huh?

01:47:01.241 --> 01:47:03.176
Have a nice day.

01:47:05.178 --> 01:47:08.048
Could you sign it
for Jacqueline, please?

01:47:10.215 --> 01:47:11.885
Of course!

01:47:21.061 --> 01:47:22.761
Thank you.

01:47:26.241 --> 01:47:28.598
