00:06.039 --> 00:08.906
Good evening, sir. How was your day?

00:08.975 --> 00:11.068
Being a lawyer stinks, Geoffrey.

00:11.144 --> 00:12.611
No matter how good a job you do...

00:12.679 --> 00:15.341
your clients still compare you
to Harry Hamlin.

00:16.349 --> 00:19.375
Yes. The resemblance is quite striking.

00:21.000 --> 00:27.074

00:49.282 --> 00:51.910
Come on, baby. Get on the soul train.

00:55.722 --> 00:59.021
I love this kind of dancing,
it makes you feel so young.

00:59.859 --> 01:03.920
<i>Doesn't that golden oldie
take you way back?</i>

01:05.331 --> 01:07.265
<i>That was Papa's Got a Brand New Bag...</i>

01:07.333 --> 01:11.064
<i>recorded 25 long years ago
by James Brown...</i>

01:11.137 --> 01:13.367
<i>the Granddaddy of Soul.</i>

01:14.641 --> 01:17.974
<i>We'll be right back
after this message from Geritol.</i>

01:19.712 --> 01:22.510
And the Fresh Prince
drives down the court.

01:22.582 --> 01:26.143
He stops, he pops, and it's... Yes!

01:26.619 --> 01:27.711
No.

01:28.621 --> 01:31.590
Will, don't play inside.
You might break something.

01:31.658 --> 01:33.888
Or something might break you.

01:33.960 --> 01:36.793
I'm sorry. You don't have a hoop outside.

01:36.863 --> 01:40.094
And Jazz is getting tired of standing
on the second-floor balcony...

01:40.166 --> 01:41.758
holding a pool skimmer.

01:42.068 --> 01:44.935
Come on, Prince, man.
I know a playground in my neighborhood.

01:45.004 --> 01:46.596
'Course we can only play half-court.

01:46.673 --> 01:49.471
They use the other end
to sell stolen appliances.

01:50.343 --> 01:51.742
Dope. Let's go.

01:51.911 --> 01:54.004
Hold on. We don't want you playing there.

01:54.080 --> 01:58.141
There's a perfectly good basketball court
at the school, where Carlton is practicing.

01:58.218 --> 02:00.482
Carlton's on the basketball team?

02:01.754 --> 02:03.278
How do they do?

02:03.556 --> 02:07.993
They try hard, but to tell you the truth,
they haven't won a game so far.

02:08.193 --> 02:11.891
Aunt Viv, don't you think
if we went down to watch them practice...

02:11.965 --> 02:14.661
Carlton would be a little embarrassed?

02:15.335 --> 02:16.825
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

03:26.739 --> 03:28.104
All right.

03:30.009 --> 03:31.374
Good try!

03:47.860 --> 03:49.885
Man, these guys need help.

03:50.063 --> 03:52.224
Help? They need a telethon.

03:55.068 --> 03:56.501
He threw that ball to me.

03:56.569 --> 03:59.231
I'm on the other team.
I'm supposed to try and get it.

03:59.305 --> 04:03.332
- You don't have to be rude about it.
- You two, make up right now.

04:06.446 --> 04:09.313
All right, men. Another brilliant warm-up.

04:10.550 --> 04:14.008
Frankly, I think there's been
way too much emphasis over the years...

04:14.087 --> 04:17.113
on putting the ball
actually through the hoop.

04:17.322 --> 04:19.654
So let's practice some passing.

04:20.827 --> 04:23.762
- Coach Smiley, may I have a minute?
- Sure.

04:24.864 --> 04:26.957
All right, men, take five.

04:27.433 --> 04:29.333
Headmaster Thorvald, good afternoon.

04:29.402 --> 04:32.200
This is Barry O'Donnell.
He's a distinguished alumnus...

04:32.272 --> 04:35.298
and I'm encouraging him to donate money
for a new gymnasium.

04:35.375 --> 04:38.640
Coach. What do you think
the team's prospects are this year?

04:38.711 --> 04:39.905
For what?

04:41.314 --> 04:42.747
For winning.

04:43.783 --> 04:45.182
Excuse me.

04:46.286 --> 04:49.619
What about those two?
You've been holding out on me.

05:01.768 --> 05:04.100
Now those are players.
I'd like to meet them.

05:04.170 --> 05:05.535
Gentlemen.

05:06.339 --> 05:07.636
Not you.

05:09.275 --> 05:12.608
You two, come on over.
I want you to meet somebody.

05:13.646 --> 05:16.774
Mr. Thorvald,
straight up, about that fire alarm:

05:16.849 --> 05:18.680
I don't know who pulled it.

05:19.585 --> 05:20.745
Forget about it.

05:20.820 --> 05:23.812
I'd like you to meet two
of Bel-Air Academy's newest recruits.

05:23.890 --> 05:27.348
This is Will Smith and... Your name is...

05:27.660 --> 05:29.093
Jazz, man.

05:29.195 --> 05:31.163
Of course, Mr. Jazzman.

05:32.565 --> 05:35.227
Will, where have you been hiding yourself?

05:35.301 --> 05:37.235
What do you mean? During gym class?

05:37.303 --> 05:41.433
No. I just wondered, how'd you two men
like to join the school team?

05:41.708 --> 05:44.176
Man, I ain't even in this school.

05:44.477 --> 05:47.344
I'm willing to look past that if you are.

05:48.247 --> 05:51.216
Coach, he can't be on the team
if he's not in school here.

05:51.284 --> 05:53.411
Okay. How about you, Will?

05:53.820 --> 05:55.788
I was just trying to find
somewhere to play.

05:55.855 --> 05:59.086
You join this team,
you can play here anytime you want.

05:59.292 --> 06:03.319
- No, I don't think so.
- It'll look good on a college application.

06:03.429 --> 06:04.794
I don't know, Coach.

06:04.864 --> 06:07.298
All right. I'll give you my car.

06:09.635 --> 06:11.000
Okay, this is gonna be fun.

06:11.070 --> 06:13.698
The coach asked me to go through
the playbook with you.

06:13.773 --> 06:17.072
Your team doesn't need a playbook.
They need a prayer book.

06:18.378 --> 06:20.107
Now, pay attention.

06:20.213 --> 06:21.874
This is you...

06:22.682 --> 06:24.616
and this is me.

06:26.152 --> 06:29.644
Carlton, you got it wrong already.
It's more like this.

06:30.456 --> 06:31.980
This is me.

06:33.860 --> 06:35.691
And this is you.

06:38.331 --> 06:39.491
Fair enough.

06:40.199 --> 06:42.531
This is my brain...

06:44.404 --> 06:46.338
and this is your brain.

06:48.641 --> 06:51.007
This is my handsome face.

06:51.077 --> 06:54.240
And this is your ugly
little Frankenstein face.

06:55.148 --> 06:57.207
- Give me that chalk.
- Come on, man, beat it.

06:57.283 --> 06:59.376
- Give it.
- Ashley!

06:59.886 --> 07:02.980
Here, Ashley,
finally there's an adult in the room.

07:05.191 --> 07:07.887
Guys, I'm trying to study.
What are you doing?

07:07.960 --> 07:10.793
- Keep away from Carlton.
- Over here.

07:13.533 --> 07:15.000
Children, please!

07:15.334 --> 07:17.495
What if your parents witnessed
this horseplay?

07:17.570 --> 07:20.266
- Give me that chalk immediately.
- Keep it away from Carlton!

07:20.339 --> 07:22.170
Keep away from Carlton and Geoffrey.

07:22.241 --> 07:25.267
You've met your match, Master William.

07:27.780 --> 07:29.873
Geoffrey, get off me, man.

07:31.350 --> 07:32.647
Geoffrey?

07:33.853 --> 07:36.117
May I get you something, sir?

07:38.925 --> 07:40.483
No, thank you.

07:41.427 --> 07:44.453
Will, how many times
do I have to tell you...

07:44.530 --> 07:46.122
that this is our living room?

07:46.199 --> 07:50.192
How'd you like it if I went into your room
and started throwing chalk around?

07:50.269 --> 07:51.964
I'd be devastated.

08:00.012 --> 08:01.138
Out.

08:05.284 --> 08:06.876
- Why did you do that?
- What?

08:06.953 --> 08:09.285
You singled Will out.
They were all goofing around.

08:09.355 --> 08:11.721
He was the mastermind. Trust me.

08:11.858 --> 08:14.053
I just wish you'd be nicer to Will.

08:14.126 --> 08:17.493
He joined the basketball team
and you haven't said a word about it.

08:17.563 --> 08:20.896
- Give him some credit.
- All right. I see your point.

08:20.967 --> 08:25.427
Besides, I think it's a great opportunity
for you two to find some common ground.

08:25.505 --> 08:28.565
After all, you were kind of
a star athlete in college.

08:28.641 --> 08:30.302
"Kind of a star athlete"?

08:30.376 --> 08:32.900
All right. You were a football god.

08:34.046 --> 08:36.207
Okay. Who knows,
it might do him some good.

08:36.282 --> 08:39.183
Nothing like a little organized sport
to straighten a guy out.

08:39.251 --> 08:41.982
Yes. It did wonders for Pete Rose.

08:48.528 --> 08:52.692
Hilary, I appreciate you coming tonight.
I know you're not a big sports fan.

08:52.865 --> 08:55.891
Mother, please,
it's Will's first game with the team.

08:55.968 --> 08:57.162
I'm proud of him.

08:57.236 --> 09:00.467
If I didn't show up to support him,
what kind of cousin would I be?

09:00.540 --> 09:02.940
It'll be three hours well spent.

09:03.175 --> 09:04.767
Three hours?

09:59.165 --> 10:02.601
Five, four, three, two, one!

10:09.475 --> 10:11.466
I'm going to Disneyland!

10:16.282 --> 10:18.045
You did all right!

10:33.299 --> 10:35.767
All right, men, good game on Friday.

10:35.835 --> 10:37.735
But we can do even better this week.

10:37.803 --> 10:40.738
- So let's go over some plays.
- Sorry I'm late, Coach!

10:40.806 --> 10:42.569
Sorry isn't good enough, Cartwell.

10:42.642 --> 10:46.373
- I was under the assumption...
- You made an assumption.

10:48.414 --> 10:52.009
Don't make an assumption...

10:52.351 --> 10:54.683
because you will be an ass...

10:54.754 --> 10:57.245
and the ump will shun you.

10:59.258 --> 11:02.284
Cartwell, after practice,
you give me 10 laps around the school.

11:02.361 --> 11:03.487
Yes, Coach.

11:04.130 --> 11:06.098
Now let's take a look at this play.

11:06.165 --> 11:09.430
What's up? It's my squad.

11:11.103 --> 11:13.230
Sorry I'm late, Coach.

11:13.305 --> 11:15.205
Don't worry about it, Smith.

11:15.274 --> 11:18.141
You just take it easy.
Save that energy for the game.

11:18.210 --> 11:20.178
But I was late, and I have to run 10 laps.

11:20.246 --> 11:22.043
Twenty laps. Now, shut up.

11:24.350 --> 11:27.376
First play. Guard inbounds to the center.

11:27.453 --> 11:30.752
Center moves down court, fakes right,
passes to the forward.

11:30.823 --> 11:31.915
What does he do?

11:31.991 --> 11:33.652
- Passes to Will?
- Bingo.

11:34.794 --> 11:38.389
Second play. Jump ball.
Ball is tipped to the center.

11:38.464 --> 11:40.762
Center shuttles to the guard,
back to the center...

11:40.833 --> 11:42.858
who hits to the forward
and over to baseline.

11:42.935 --> 11:44.493
- What does he do?
- Passes to Will.

11:44.570 --> 11:45.696
Yes!

11:47.139 --> 11:49.573
Okay. Number three.

11:49.775 --> 11:51.208
Forward inbounds from here...

11:51.277 --> 11:54.041
bounce pass to the guard,
who zips it back to the forward...

11:54.113 --> 11:55.637
under the net. What does he do?

11:55.715 --> 11:59.276
If he's clear, he goes for the lay-up.
Otherwise, back to the guard.

11:59.351 --> 12:02.377
Okay, Banks, not paying attention?
Ten laps.

12:03.556 --> 12:06.855
Not paying attention?
Look at Will. He's asleep.

12:08.494 --> 12:11.486
Mind your own business, Banks.
That's 20 laps.

12:18.904 --> 12:23.603
<i>NBA superstar Isaiah Thomas
is used to having things his own way.</i>

12:25.144 --> 12:26.702
<i>But not today.</i>

12:47.800 --> 12:49.267
How do you do it, Prince?

12:49.335 --> 12:50.893
Easy, Isaiah.

12:55.341 --> 12:58.799
<i>Air Fresh gym shoes. Just pass it to Will.</i>

13:06.819 --> 13:08.184
Hi, pumpkin. Hi, love.

13:08.254 --> 13:09.619
- Hi.
- Is Will home yet?

13:09.688 --> 13:11.952
He's outside playing basketball
with Carlton.

13:12.024 --> 13:14.492
Come on, Will. Now let me down.

13:16.128 --> 13:18.187
Will, would you come in here
a minute, please?

13:18.264 --> 13:19.595
What's going on?

13:19.665 --> 13:23.692
I've been thinking about what you said
about us finding some common ground.

13:23.769 --> 13:26.602
- Good.
- The firm has season tickets...

13:26.672 --> 13:30.005
for the Laker game, so I put in for them.
I thought we could go.

13:30.075 --> 13:33.511
Philip, what a great idea. He'll love it.

13:33.579 --> 13:34.978
Thank you.

13:37.383 --> 13:40.216
Uncle Phil, thanks for putting
the hoop up on the garage.

13:40.286 --> 13:43.278
It's really helping my lay-ups, Dad.
Come on out, I'll show you.

13:43.355 --> 13:45.323
Sounds great, Carlton,
but in a minute, okay?

13:45.391 --> 13:48.827
- You wanted to talk to me?
- I have two tickets to the Lakers game.

13:48.894 --> 13:51.624
- How'd you like to come?
- Word, I'm with that.

13:51.697 --> 13:55.224
Give the Laker girls an opportunity
to check out a future Laker.

13:56.535 --> 13:57.934
Yeah, right.

13:58.337 --> 14:00.134
Son, you want to show me those lay-ups?

14:00.206 --> 14:03.903
Maybe a little bit later.
Actually, I've got some studying to do.

14:03.976 --> 14:05.967
- After dinner?
- Okay.

14:06.045 --> 14:08.343
- Uncle Phil, want to shoot a few hoops?
- Sure.

14:08.414 --> 14:11.713
Did I tell you how my high-school team
won the state championship?

14:11.784 --> 14:14.412
I made the final basket right at the buzzer.

14:14.486 --> 14:15.748
That's decent.

14:16.488 --> 14:18.581
- Hi, Carlton.
- Hi, Hilary.

14:19.058 --> 14:21.925
- Hilary, can I ask you something?
- Sure.

14:22.261 --> 14:24.729
How was I in the basketball game
last Friday?

14:24.797 --> 14:27.561
You were great. You didn't make
any baskets or anything...

14:27.633 --> 14:29.965
but you looked cute in your uniform.

14:30.035 --> 14:32.367
I think it's great
how you don't get it too sweaty.

14:32.438 --> 14:35.407
I guess it's 'cause you don't run too fast.
Smart move.

14:37.009 --> 14:38.874
Did Dad mention me during the game?

14:38.944 --> 14:41.606
He did turn around
to the guy behind him once and say:

14:41.680 --> 14:44.478
"Shut up.
That's my son you're talking about."

14:47.586 --> 14:48.814
It's Will, isn't it?

14:48.888 --> 14:50.822
No. It's not.

14:54.126 --> 14:55.559
Talk to me.

14:56.996 --> 14:59.829
Look, it's ridiculous
to compare yourself to Will.

15:00.099 --> 15:02.966
You're captain of the debate team,
a straight "A" student...

15:03.035 --> 15:06.334
you're leader of the glee club.
So what if Will's good at basketball?

15:06.405 --> 15:08.373
Thanks, Hilary. That means a lot to me.

15:08.440 --> 15:10.670
Besides, if that basket
were two feet lower...

15:10.743 --> 15:13.075
you'd be just as good as he is.

15:19.852 --> 15:22.252
Geoffrey, I'm surprised
you decided to come.

15:22.321 --> 15:23.913
You're not a basketball fan.

15:23.989 --> 15:27.356
True, madam, but I have found
that any game can be made interesting...

15:27.426 --> 15:29.451
if you put a little money on it.

15:29.528 --> 15:32.986
- You bet on this game?
- $50 says Bel-Air wins it.

15:33.399 --> 15:34.957
Who'd take that bet?

15:35.301 --> 15:36.825
You rang, beautiful?

15:38.037 --> 15:40.062
Jazz, you bet against Will?

15:40.139 --> 15:42.505
Yeah. He screws up, I'm loaded.

15:52.017 --> 15:56.386
<i>Students, parents, alumni,
let me introduce our beloved coach...</i>

15:56.488 --> 15:57.978
<i>Herb Smiley.</i>

16:02.094 --> 16:03.584
<i>Thank you.</i>

16:03.662 --> 16:06.130
<i>I see a lot of new faces out here tonight...</i>

16:06.198 --> 16:08.393
<i>faces I didn't see when we were losing.</i>

16:09.768 --> 16:13.761
<i>People who did not support this team
in its darkest hour.</i>

16:14.206 --> 16:17.573
<i>All I can say is, I don't blame you one bit.</i>

16:18.544 --> 16:20.603
<i>Half the time, I didn't want to be there.</i>

16:20.679 --> 16:24.376
<i>And quite frankly,
I usually ducked out a little early.</i>

16:25.384 --> 16:29.616
<i>But that's all gonna change tonight
because of our new superstar...</i>

16:30.122 --> 16:31.487
<i>Will Smith.</i>

17:49.535 --> 17:52.436
<i>With seven seconds remaining,
Bel-Air is down by two points...</i>

17:52.504 --> 17:53.994
<i>and calls a time out.</i>

17:54.073 --> 17:57.565
Our only hope for winning this game
is by shooting a three-pointer.

17:57.643 --> 18:00.237
So here's the plan.
Cartwell, you inbound to Hunt.

18:00.312 --> 18:02.906
- Hunt, what do you do?
- Shoot for the three-pointer?

18:02.981 --> 18:05.575
Very funny.
That'll be 10 laps, chowderhead.

18:06.285 --> 18:08.549
- What's the right answer?
- Pass it to Will.

18:08.620 --> 18:10.884
All right. Now, let's do it.

18:10.956 --> 18:13.117
One, two, three, Bel-Air!

18:20.933 --> 18:22.594
Oh, my God.

18:41.887 --> 18:43.684
Yes!

18:50.362 --> 18:54.594
Thirty, forty, fifty!

18:55.267 --> 18:57.167
- There.
- Thanks, man.

18:57.236 --> 18:59.466
Nice doing business with you.

19:00.172 --> 19:03.471
Mr. Jazz,
the World Snooker Championship...

19:03.542 --> 19:05.942
is on the sports station in a few moments.

19:06.078 --> 19:08.911
Would you care to place a wager?

19:09.314 --> 19:12.340
- I don't know anything about snooker.
- Don't worry.

19:12.417 --> 19:15.352
I'll tell you everything you need to know.

19:18.724 --> 19:21.488
I'm going to shoot some hoops.
If you'd like to practice...

19:21.560 --> 19:25.155
some new and more spectacular ways
to lose a game, please join me.

19:25.964 --> 19:28.228
- Put that down.
- Put what down?

19:28.333 --> 19:30.733
- My basketball.
- Your basketball?

19:31.203 --> 19:33.728
Excuse me, your name is Spalding?

19:34.840 --> 19:37.434
Dad gave it to me for my birthday
three years ago.

19:37.509 --> 19:38.806
It's my ball. Give it.

19:38.877 --> 19:41.641
In a bad mood? You should be
the happiest guy in the world.

19:41.713 --> 19:43.078
Yeah? Why?

19:43.215 --> 19:45.740
'Cause you got out
of that locker room alive.

19:45.851 --> 19:48.285
Man, Coach Smiley was upset.

19:48.353 --> 19:51.550
Boy, you're lucky
that was just a starter's pistol.

19:51.790 --> 19:53.951
I was trying to win the game.

19:54.026 --> 19:55.823
No, you were trying to be the hero.

19:55.894 --> 19:58.920
Somebody else can be the hero
besides you all the time.

19:59.531 --> 20:01.192
Let's get something straight.

20:01.266 --> 20:04.702
I been here for two months.
I been getting yelled at at home...

20:04.770 --> 20:08.706
screamed at at school,
I been sent to detention, grounded...

20:08.774 --> 20:12.175
threatened with expulsion
on almost a daily basis.

20:12.844 --> 20:16.336
I finally do something I get credit for,
and you can't take it.

20:16.481 --> 20:18.005
Man, I got news for you.

20:18.083 --> 20:21.610
I ain't about to sell myself short
just to make you feel better. Grow up!

20:21.687 --> 20:24.383
You should grow up,
hogging the ball every chance you get!

20:24.456 --> 20:26.117
- I wasn't hogging nothing.
- You were!

20:26.191 --> 20:27.590
Okay, you two.

20:28.227 --> 20:30.195
What's this all about?

20:30.929 --> 20:33.261
Carlton doesn't want me
to use his basketball...

20:33.332 --> 20:35.800
'cause he's afraid
I might get it in the basket.

20:35.867 --> 20:38.529
Will you two start acting your age?

20:38.604 --> 20:41.903
What I saw on that basketball court
tonight was a disgrace.

20:42.040 --> 20:44.770
If I'd made that last shot,
I'd be the hero right now.

20:44.843 --> 20:48.074
Carlton, the fact that you missed the shot
wasn't a disgrace.

20:48.146 --> 20:51.172
You stole the ball
from a member of your own team.

20:51.883 --> 20:54.408
Yeah, and if you'd passed it to me,
we would've won.

20:54.486 --> 20:55.680
You would?

20:55.754 --> 20:58.587
Of course, I can make that shot
with my eyes closed...

20:58.657 --> 21:01.888
- and one hand tied behind my back.
- Was that gonna be your next trick?

21:01.960 --> 21:04.190
'Cause you were like
a one-man circus out there.

21:04.263 --> 21:07.494
Uncle Phil, the coach told the team
to pass the ball to me.

21:07.566 --> 21:09.500
Did he tell you to woof at the crowd...

21:09.568 --> 21:13.095
kiss the cheerleader between plays,
and shoot the ball backwards?

21:13.472 --> 21:16.168
No, I came up with all that fly stuff myself.

21:17.676 --> 21:20.236
That wasn't fly, Will.

21:20.612 --> 21:23.376
A real star plays with the team.

21:24.283 --> 21:26.751
Maybe you should think about that.

21:33.458 --> 21:36.393
Carlton, can I ask you something?

21:37.095 --> 21:38.221
Sure.

21:38.864 --> 21:43.324
When you stole the ball from Will
and tried to make that Hail Mary shot...

21:43.402 --> 21:45.666
what were you thinking about?

21:47.072 --> 21:48.972
- I don't know.
- Really?

21:51.476 --> 21:54.502
I guess I was just thinking
of the first game Will won...

21:54.579 --> 21:57.844
and how you ran out on the court
and you were so proud of him.

21:57.916 --> 22:01.215
I guess I thought it would be cool
if it happened to me.

22:01.320 --> 22:04.153
Carlton, you don't have to be a hero.

22:04.556 --> 22:07.218
I'm proud that you're out there
giving it all you got.

22:07.292 --> 22:10.318
You started coming to games
when Will joined the team.

22:10.395 --> 22:14.388
- I wanted to support him.
- You wouldn't come when it was just me.

22:16.702 --> 22:19.068
I'd like to come to everything you do.

22:19.137 --> 22:23.130
I always come to your tennis games,
to your debate matches...

22:23.208 --> 22:25.540
your glee club concerts.

22:25.610 --> 22:28.374
Frankly, keeping up
with your extracurricular activities...

22:28.447 --> 22:30.415
is a 24-hour-a-day job.

22:31.249 --> 22:34.116
Did I mention
I was elected editor of the yearbook?

22:35.220 --> 22:37.381
I didn't mean to slight you.

22:37.622 --> 22:39.681
But I can't slight Will, either.

22:39.791 --> 22:42.259
His mother is 3,000 miles away.

22:42.327 --> 22:45.387
He needs a cheering section
as much as you do.

22:45.464 --> 22:46.931
Maybe more.

22:49.568 --> 22:53.163
- I'm gonna head up. Good night, son.
- Good night, Dad.

22:56.375 --> 22:57.603
Will.

22:58.710 --> 22:59.904
Yeah?

23:01.213 --> 23:02.339
Here.
