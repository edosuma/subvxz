01:40.810 --> 01:42.145
<i>Good morning, Mr. Bryce.</i>

01:42.353 --> 01:44.147
<i>I trust the pickup ran smoothly.</i>

01:44.481 --> 01:47.066
Hand-off was clean.
No stops till the exit point.

01:51.029 --> 01:52.447
<i>Clear roads all the way, Chief,</i>

01:54.115 --> 01:55.241
<i>just as you predicted.</i>

01:55.325 --> 01:56.159
Thank you for agreeing

01:56.242 --> 01:58.119
to an earlier departure time,
Mr. Kurosawa.

01:58.369 --> 01:59.680
I'm honored that you and your wives

01:59.704 --> 02:01.748
have entrusted
a Triple-A Protection Service today.

02:06.836 --> 02:09.464
<i>Moving red to green option,
coming in on your vector.</i>

02:10.173 --> 02:12.342
<i>Get the engine started,
I want an immediate takeoff.</i>

02:12.801 --> 02:14.201
<i>Air space has already been cleared.</i>

02:14.594 --> 02:15.594
<i>Roger that.</i>

02:16.012 --> 02:18.139
<i>All channels moving
to restricted air space.</i>

02:23.311 --> 02:24.311
Shall we?

02:37.909 --> 02:38.910
Mr. Kurosawa...

02:48.837 --> 02:50.588
<i>Another
Triple-A delivery, sir.</i>

02:50.672 --> 02:51.952
Stay with him
till he's airborne.

02:52.006 --> 02:53.716
<i>- Yes, sir.</i>
- Canvas is clear?

02:54.384 --> 02:56.594
<i>Nothing for miles, Chief. Almost boring.</i>

02:56.845 --> 02:57.845
And what's our motto?

02:58.805 --> 03:00.139
Boring is always best.

03:10.775 --> 03:11.775
Move! Move!

03:12.151 --> 03:13.945
Client down! Client down!

03:14.028 --> 03:15.071
<i>Code seven! Code seven!</i>

03:15.321 --> 03:16.321
<i>Jesus!</i>

03:16.531 --> 03:18.366
<i>It's like a goddamn milkshake in here!</i>

03:18.575 --> 03:19.784
<i>Bravo One down.</i>

03:19.868 --> 03:21.744
<i>We need
a clean-up team in here now!</i>

03:21.828 --> 03:23.746
<i>Repeat, Bravo One down.</i>

03:40.305 --> 03:43.975
<i>♪ There's no one to have fun with ♪</i>

03:49.522 --> 03:55.278
<i>♪ Since my baby's love
Has been done with ♪</i>

04:01.159 --> 04:05.580
<i>♪ All I do is think of you... ♪</i>

04:17.007 --> 04:18.927
Fucking piece of paper I've got here.

04:19.344 --> 04:22.472
...I'm gonna beat this motherfucker's...

04:26.059 --> 04:27.059
Holy shit.

04:32.565 --> 04:33.565
Mr. Seifert.

04:36.194 --> 04:38.404
- Are we ready to go?
- "Are we ready?"

04:38.655 --> 04:39.530
I've been waiting!

04:39.614 --> 04:42.241
What the hell took you so long?
It's half past 9:00!

04:42.325 --> 04:44.661
Apologies. I had to make some
preparations... Mr. Seifert.

04:44.744 --> 04:45.744
Mr. Seifert!

04:47.080 --> 04:48.600
It's best if I go through doors first.

04:49.040 --> 04:50.040
- Okay?
- Okay.

04:51.209 --> 04:52.603
You don't know what I'm dealing with here.

04:52.627 --> 04:53.836
Come on, let's go, let's go.

04:53.920 --> 04:54.837
- Double time.
- You don't understand.

04:54.921 --> 04:56.589
These people are animals!

04:56.881 --> 04:58.466
They're probably here already,

04:59.384 --> 05:01.528
- just waiting for me to leave.
- I can appreciate your concern,

05:01.552 --> 05:03.346
but I assure you, you are perfectly safe.

05:03.763 --> 05:05.563
All you need to do
is exactly what I tell you.

05:06.182 --> 05:08.685
Mr. Seifert? Mr. Seifert?
This way, please.

05:09.060 --> 05:11.145
All right. Is it not enough cocaine,
or too much?

05:14.732 --> 05:16.734
They say you're Triple-A rated.

05:17.151 --> 05:18.152
Is that a real thing?

05:18.236 --> 05:22.073
Let's just focus on you dying
of natural causes, shall we?

05:22.782 --> 05:24.242
Soon.

05:24.450 --> 05:25.450
That's my car.

05:25.702 --> 05:26.869
Take a mental picture of it.

05:27.328 --> 05:28.955
I find it safer if we're using a car

05:29.038 --> 05:30.790
that blends in
with the surrounding traffic.

05:33.209 --> 05:35.449
Well, that was easy.
In fact, practically nothing at all.

05:35.712 --> 05:36.963
Boring is always best.

05:37.213 --> 05:38.373
I trust you'll reduce your...

05:40.049 --> 05:41.718
- <i>What?</i>
- This is Michael Bryce.

05:41.801 --> 05:43.112
I'm an executive protection agent,

05:43.136 --> 05:44.697
fully licensed and bonded within the EU.

05:44.721 --> 05:47.515
<i>Fuckin' hell. I know it's you.
I've got caller ID!</i>

05:47.598 --> 05:50.601
<i>Such a fucking dick.
You got a pickup for me or what?</i>

05:50.685 --> 05:54.522
Yes. I've extracted my client
from 27 Saint George Street.

05:54.605 --> 05:55.690
Clean-up is required.

05:56.858 --> 06:00.486
<i>On the seventh floor, north stairwell,
I've left a French national</i>

06:00.570 --> 06:02.113
employed by the Taray Crime Syndicate.

06:03.364 --> 06:05.084
<i>You'll find two more
in the south stairwell.</i>

06:05.324 --> 06:08.204
<i>On the roof, you're gonna find another
who's gonna need some dental work.</i>

06:09.662 --> 06:12.790
<i>In the alley, there's two gentlemen
who may require some counseling.</i>

06:15.126 --> 06:18.504
<i>One more in the east office
on the sixth floor under construction</i>

06:19.213 --> 06:21.549
<i>and one on the number three elevator.</i>

06:24.719 --> 06:25.803
Oh, oh, oh!

06:25.887 --> 06:28.222
<i>Parking garage,
under the Rolls-Royce in space five,</i>

06:28.306 --> 06:29.932
<i>there's a pound of plastic explosives,</i>

06:30.016 --> 06:31.536
you might want to call the bomb squad.

06:33.478 --> 06:35.688
Check that. Make it the fire department.

06:35.772 --> 06:36.606
Is that my car?

06:36.689 --> 06:39.150
I'm afraid so. Have a seat,
it's been a long day.

06:45.031 --> 06:47.033
That was a custom Rolls-Royce,
one of a kind.

06:47.366 --> 06:48.806
I thought that was an unusual color.

06:48.993 --> 06:49.993
Was that periwinkle?

06:50.661 --> 06:52.288
I did find this in the backseat.

06:52.663 --> 06:53.498
Scraps!

06:53.581 --> 06:54.581
Precious, aren't they?

06:57.168 --> 06:58.419
It smells like ass in here.

06:58.836 --> 06:59.836
Buckle up.

07:00.004 --> 07:02.256
This car certainly
isn't Triple-A rated.

07:02.340 --> 07:04.509
It's not even fit for animals.

07:35.665 --> 07:37.667
Keep moving!

07:38.459 --> 07:40.378
Everybody go home!

07:41.546 --> 07:42.672
Get out of the way!

07:50.137 --> 07:51.597
Have a look there.

08:12.910 --> 08:14.370
Knock on the doors.

08:22.253 --> 08:23.253
How's your English?

08:26.215 --> 08:29.468
I don't know much English, Mr. President.

08:32.263 --> 08:35.057
"The only way for the country to progress

08:35.975 --> 08:40.270
is by eradicating the scourge of genocide

08:40.354 --> 08:44.232
blackening our country
and our livelihood."

08:47.278 --> 08:49.155
.I appreciate your modesty.

08:51.782 --> 08:54.994
I hope we're not...
disturbing your family.

08:58.831 --> 09:00.333
They are on holiday.

09:00.875 --> 09:01.875
Good for them.

09:04.295 --> 09:06.088
Family makes a man whole.

09:13.304 --> 09:15.473
I could have
you executed for treason,

09:15.556 --> 09:20.102
but another would simply stand
a little bit higher on your corpse.

09:20.811 --> 09:25.066
There must be some other lesson
I could teach you.

09:33.741 --> 09:34.784
As I said,

09:36.327 --> 09:38.204
there is nothing more important...

09:38.913 --> 09:40.289
than a good education.

09:46.587 --> 09:47.587
<i>Professor Asimov,</i>

09:48.631 --> 09:50.675
can you please tell the court
what happened next?

09:51.342 --> 09:54.261
Then... I was taken

09:54.345 --> 09:56.764
to one of Dukhovich's internment camps.

09:59.517 --> 10:01.268
I was there for three years

10:03.062 --> 10:05.690
until he was finally overthrown.

10:06.691 --> 10:10.277
Arrested like the monster he is.

10:12.655 --> 10:14.156
Thank you, Professor Asimov.

10:14.824 --> 10:18.869
Your Honor, I request
that this entire testimony be disregarded.

10:19.161 --> 10:22.373
Without any evidence,
this is merely hearsay.

10:23.499 --> 10:24.792
Sustained.

10:24.875 --> 10:26.627
<i>The trial
of former Belarusian President</i>

10:26.711 --> 10:28.546
<i>Vladislav Dukhovich continued today</i>

10:28.629 --> 10:31.424
<i>with emotional testimony
from many of his country's victims.</i>

10:31.799 --> 10:34.635
But while powerful to hear,
Dukhovich's attorneys say

10:34.719 --> 10:37.221
they are nothing more
than the lies of his enemies.

10:37.304 --> 10:39.807
Long one of the world's
most brutal dictators...

10:39.890 --> 10:42.476
Who stands accused
of ethnic cleansing on a massive scale.

10:42.560 --> 10:45.813
An unprecedented level of security
is in place around the courthouse.

10:45.896 --> 10:48.357
Even the airspace
above this city is closed.

10:48.441 --> 10:50.901
So far, the prosecution
has been crippled by the lack

10:50.985 --> 10:52.903
of any hard evidence
against Dukhovich himself.

10:52.987 --> 10:54.488
Numerous witnesses

10:54.572 --> 10:56.615
who were expected
to testify have disappeared.

10:56.699 --> 10:59.744
Is there anyone brave enough
to come forward with evidence

10:59.827 --> 11:02.246
and finally put an end
to his brutal reign?

11:19.597 --> 11:21.807
Mr. Kincaid,
this is Interpol's offer.

11:22.141 --> 11:25.102
In return for your testimony
against former President Dukhovich,

11:25.561 --> 11:28.647
your wife will receive a full
pardon from all jurisdictions.

11:30.691 --> 11:33.652
You're going to pardon an innocent woman?

11:35.613 --> 11:37.013
That's mighty fucking white of you.

11:37.990 --> 11:39.742
Assuming we accept this arrangement

11:39.825 --> 11:41.118
for Sonia Kincaid,

11:41.827 --> 11:44.413
there's still the matter
of an agreement regarding my client.

11:49.460 --> 11:50.460
He will receive

11:51.670 --> 11:55.216
this letter recommending leniency.

11:55.549 --> 11:57.384
Mr. Kincaid is a contract killer

11:57.468 --> 11:59.887
facing two dozen counts
of murder in ten countries.

12:00.137 --> 12:01.680
Absent a legitimate deal,

12:01.931 --> 12:04.266
he will never breathe free air again.
Under no...

12:11.774 --> 12:13.859
Sonia goes free.

12:16.195 --> 12:17.822
We're all set, Director Casoria.

12:18.656 --> 12:20.491
Let's get this gentleman to The Hague.

12:30.126 --> 12:32.044
Mr. Kincaid,
this is Agent Roussel.

12:33.129 --> 12:34.272
She'll be leading a security detail,

12:34.296 --> 12:37.424
which will escort you
to the International Criminal Court.

12:38.926 --> 12:42.388
You know, Dukhovich's men have killed
every single witness brought against them,

12:42.596 --> 12:45.391
and my security detail
is a dozen off-duty cops?

12:46.225 --> 12:49.186
These are the most highly-trained officers
in Europe, Mr. Kincaid.

12:49.270 --> 12:50.938
We have taken every precaution

12:51.021 --> 12:53.732
to make sure that your involvement
is completely classified.

12:54.400 --> 12:55.442
It's a secret?

12:56.152 --> 12:58.112
That makes me feel so much better.

12:58.404 --> 12:59.488
Well, I can assure you,

13:00.156 --> 13:01.365
even if there was an attempt,

13:01.866 --> 13:03.506
we're more than prepared for any assault.

13:06.036 --> 13:07.955
You prepared for that assault,
motherfucker?

13:08.581 --> 13:12.459
Uncuff me, give me some car keys,
a couple guns, I'll meet you guys there.

13:12.543 --> 13:15.421
The court's deadline
is at 5:00 p.m. tomorrow, Mr. Kincaid.

13:16.255 --> 13:20.301
That gives us 27 hours to transport
you from Manchester to the Netherlands.

13:21.552 --> 13:24.889
If you want to help your wife,
you should get moving.

13:28.225 --> 13:29.351
Okay, Inspector Clouseau,

13:29.435 --> 13:31.687
let's see what these elite troops
of yours can do.

13:32.354 --> 13:33.354
Come on, guys, let's go.

13:36.400 --> 13:37.400
Agent Roussel,

13:38.360 --> 13:40.487
I don't have to remind
you of the importance of this.

13:41.197 --> 13:43.741
- No, ma'am.
- And don't doubt what he's capable of.

13:44.491 --> 13:45.491
I won't, sir.

14:11.936 --> 14:13.729
<i>- Take a left on Kirkland Avenue.
- Yes.</i>

14:17.441 --> 14:20.694
What a pretty little town.
Old, narrow streets,

14:21.195 --> 14:22.780
buildings nice and close,

14:23.280 --> 14:25.699
lots of great views
from all those windows.

14:25.783 --> 14:27.326
This route's been wiped clean for us.

14:27.409 --> 14:28.410
Nothing to worry about.

14:28.494 --> 14:29.870
Is that right?

14:30.412 --> 14:31.705
How's that nose of yours doing?

14:42.132 --> 14:43.509
<i>Take a diversion route.</i>

14:43.592 --> 14:45.511
Got a boyfriend, Roussie?
Significant other?

14:46.220 --> 14:47.846
I need you to be quiet, Mr. Kincaid.

14:47.930 --> 14:50.015
I'm just saying,
now might be the perfect time

14:50.099 --> 14:52.226
to write one of those
"I'll always love you" texts.

14:56.272 --> 14:58.274
Relax, motherfucker.

14:58.357 --> 15:00.818
If you hear the shot,
it wasn't meant for you.

15:03.529 --> 15:05.572
<i>Two-two-one,
ten-four en route.</i>

15:28.971 --> 15:30.681
Fuck!

15:30.764 --> 15:32.141
Cover me!

15:32.224 --> 15:33.350
Move! Move!

15:41.692 --> 15:42.735
Cover me!

16:00.961 --> 16:03.756
Move! Move!
Go! Get that door open!

16:04.256 --> 16:06.967
Go! Go! Alpha Squad, with me!

16:07.384 --> 16:09.345
Agent Roberts, protect the witness!

16:15.184 --> 16:16.518
Parker, take the left flank!

16:28.947 --> 16:30.783
Shit! We need more backup!

16:33.702 --> 16:35.537
Follow me!

16:35.621 --> 16:37.039
Fuck!

16:58.268 --> 17:01.188
Agent Roussel!
God damn it, somebody!

17:01.271 --> 17:02.564
We need backup n...

17:09.070 --> 17:10.070
Turn around!

17:10.406 --> 17:11.281
It's ready!

17:11.365 --> 17:12.491
Come on!

17:23.419 --> 17:24.420
Lay down some cover fire.

17:54.658 --> 17:56.285
Fuck!

18:16.263 --> 18:18.140
- Show me your hands!
- Bitch, please!

18:19.975 --> 18:21.435
- Put these on.
- Fuck that.

18:21.685 --> 18:23.270
Interpol's compromised. You know that.

18:24.688 --> 18:26.773
Either you shoot me or watch me bleed out.

18:34.156 --> 18:35.407
We gotta get off the street.

18:35.491 --> 18:37.011
There's a safe house
not far from here.

18:42.623 --> 18:44.750
<i>As a car bomb has
exploded in Bishopgate Green,</i>

18:44.833 --> 18:46.752
<i>near Coventry City Center...</i>

18:50.839 --> 18:53.675
Don't even think
about answering that fucking phone!

18:54.718 --> 18:56.558
The only way Dukhovich
could've known our route

18:56.762 --> 18:58.430
was if he had somebody on the inside.

18:59.181 --> 19:01.642
Now, I need medical supplies,
and you need help.

19:02.100 --> 19:03.602
So, if you're gonna call somebody,

19:03.685 --> 19:05.896
they have to be totally out of the loop.

19:09.483 --> 19:11.151
I've had
the Black Diamond service

19:11.235 --> 19:12.694
four times now, you understand?

19:13.195 --> 19:15.364
Four times. The car still
smells like a cemetery.

19:15.572 --> 19:18.534
Are you washing the car with old assholes?

19:19.368 --> 19:20.619
Or...

19:20.702 --> 19:22.079
Just help me to understand.

19:24.790 --> 19:25.790
Just a second here.

19:27.501 --> 19:28.669
Hello, Amelia.

19:28.961 --> 19:30.629
I'm texting you an address in Coventry.

19:31.171 --> 19:32.440
You need to get there immediately.

19:32.464 --> 19:34.383
Bring three units of O-negative blood.

19:34.633 --> 19:37.386
I'm doing very well, thank you.
How are you?

19:37.761 --> 19:39.721
I don't have
the time for this, Michael.

19:39.805 --> 19:41.431
I have a job I need you to do.

19:42.307 --> 19:44.810
- Pass.
- I wasn't offering. I'm telling you.

19:44.893 --> 19:46.353
I have a job you're going to do.

19:46.436 --> 19:48.730
<i>I'm not gonna let you charm me
into this one, Amelia.</i>

19:49.147 --> 19:50.232
Okay, let's be clear.

19:50.649 --> 19:52.335
I'm not any happier about this
than you are,

19:52.359 --> 19:53.610
but I don't have a choice.

19:53.694 --> 19:55.571
Well, thank God I do.

19:56.071 --> 19:57.071
<i>No, Michael, you don't.</i>

19:57.489 --> 19:59.324
<i>Because if you're not
where I need you to be,</i>

19:59.408 --> 20:01.410
<i>I'm going to expose
you and your work to Interpol.</i>

20:01.868 --> 20:04.496
That elite Triple-A status
you want back so badly,

20:04.955 --> 20:07.635
- I'll make sure you never get near it.
- You're threatening me now?

20:08.333 --> 20:09.835
Not you, her. Are you threatening...

20:09.918 --> 20:12.078
You can't just threaten me
into taking orders from you.

20:12.129 --> 20:15.066
I guess we'll see. You're three hours
away. I'll see you in two and a half.

20:15.090 --> 20:17.718
Three... Okay, okay.
I guess we will. Jesus Christ.

20:18.176 --> 20:20.596
Here, we're gonna load
all these into the car, okay?

20:20.887 --> 20:23.247
We're gonna take the car out in the front,
and then burn it.

20:24.766 --> 20:26.518
This place is like a war zone.

20:26.893 --> 20:28.061
We got bodies everywhere.

20:28.145 --> 20:29.980
Our unit's compromised. Everyone's down.

20:30.480 --> 20:31.523
Get those guys IDed.

20:31.815 --> 20:33.483
And I've got no sign of Agent Roussel.

20:33.775 --> 20:36.570
Maybe 15 to 20
dead mercenaries, heavily armed.

20:37.070 --> 20:38.572
Media circus is in town.

20:39.156 --> 20:40.236
That's not the worst of it.

20:43.285 --> 20:44.285
Kincaid is gone.

20:46.121 --> 20:47.748
Coventry, every available agent.

20:48.373 --> 20:49.875
Report back to me with any updates.

20:50.208 --> 20:51.208
<i>Yes, ma'am.</i>

20:53.837 --> 20:54.877
There must've been a leak.

20:55.672 --> 20:58.342
I told you, there are too many
agencies involved.

20:58.550 --> 20:59.550
Get to The Hague.

20:59.885 --> 21:01.405
See what you can get out of Dukhovich.

21:01.845 --> 21:02.845
I'll try.

21:03.347 --> 21:05.349
And alert the penitentiary in Amsterdam.

21:05.807 --> 21:07.727
Have them triple the guard
around Kincaid's wife.

21:08.226 --> 21:09.226
Got it.

21:32.793 --> 21:34.795
Mrs. Kincaid, your attorney.

21:52.813 --> 21:54.293
Did I tell you you could turn around?

21:59.653 --> 22:01.446
What do you want,
you useless piece of shit?

22:01.947 --> 22:03.657
Baby, baby, it's me.

22:03.740 --> 22:05.951
My bad.

22:06.576 --> 22:07.744
What do you want,

22:07.828 --> 22:10.580
you fucking <i>hijo de puta</i> motherfucker!

22:11.164 --> 22:12.499
I just wanted to hear your voice.

22:12.582 --> 22:13.582
Fuck you!

22:14.167 --> 22:16.253
There, you heard my voice.

22:16.503 --> 22:20.173
<i>The only reason I'm in this shit hole
is so that they can get to your sorry ass!</i>

22:21.591 --> 22:23.844
How you doing? Made a shank yet?

22:23.927 --> 22:24.845
<i>What for?</i>

22:24.928 --> 22:26.768
It's prison, baby.
You got to protect yourself.

22:27.222 --> 22:28.974
It's a Dutch prison, Darius!

22:29.057 --> 22:30.851
What are they gonna do,
beat me with a clog?

22:31.268 --> 22:32.561
You got a view at least?

22:32.978 --> 22:35.647
<i>Just a whole lot of corny Dutch buildings.</i>

22:36.606 --> 22:40.068
There's one
with a huge fucking clock on it.

22:40.736 --> 22:42.404
Like that's what I need right now.

22:42.487 --> 22:44.281
Do they have those flowers you love?

22:44.364 --> 22:47.576
Irises?
They come from there, right?

22:47.659 --> 22:49.745
Fucking tulips, Darius.

22:49.828 --> 22:52.914
<i>What kind of a piece-of-shit husband</i>

22:52.998 --> 22:55.250
<i>doesn't remember
his wife's favorite flowers?</i>

22:55.917 --> 22:57.335
<i>You never remember anything.</i>

22:57.627 --> 22:59.045
What's our anniversary?

22:59.129 --> 23:00.630
I'm gonna make this up to you, baby.

23:00.714 --> 23:03.049
<i>You see, that's what
I'm talking about,</i> cabrón.

23:05.051 --> 23:06.344
Darius, is something wrong?

23:08.346 --> 23:12.601
Not a thing, baby. Not a fucking thing.

23:15.812 --> 23:16.897
Then I want to hear it.

23:20.817 --> 23:23.111
<i>♪ 'Cause you know just what to say ♪</i>

23:24.404 --> 23:26.198
<i>♪ And you know just what to do ♪</i>

23:27.741 --> 23:29.367
<i>♪ Let me start by saying ♪</i>

23:30.744 --> 23:31.912
<i>♪ I love you ♪</i>

23:39.002 --> 23:41.797
- Hello? Sonia?
- Hello? Darius!

23:43.590 --> 23:46.510
You fucking piece of shit!

23:49.679 --> 23:51.139
You fucking shit!

24:20.168 --> 24:21.848
Go ahead,
you might as well finish the job.

24:34.140 --> 24:35.267
Why am I here, Amelia?

24:36.059 --> 24:37.185
A high-value transport.

24:38.812 --> 24:41.940
Oh, high value? Oh, I don't...

24:42.816 --> 24:45.527
I don't really do high value anymore.
These days I'm more in the...

24:46.486 --> 24:48.071
mid-level coked-out attorney market.

24:48.947 --> 24:50.031
Why do you think that is?

24:50.115 --> 24:51.575
Seriously, Michael?

24:51.658 --> 24:52.658
Because of you.

24:52.701 --> 24:55.620
You used me to climb the Interpol ladder,
and here we are again.

24:58.832 --> 24:59.833
You up for a promotion?

25:00.375 --> 25:02.937
You have to blame me for every little bump
in your road, don't you.

25:02.961 --> 25:05.213
No, these aren't bumps. No, no, no bumps.

25:05.297 --> 25:07.507
Just one dead Japanese arms dealer.

25:08.300 --> 25:09.819
- I had nothing to do...
- "...to do with."

25:09.843 --> 25:11.011
Do you know what happens

25:11.094 --> 25:13.972
when a Triple-A rated
executive protection agent

25:14.055 --> 25:14.973
loses a client?

25:15.056 --> 25:17.684
Triple-A. I was up here, yeah?

25:17.767 --> 25:19.519
Then I opened up to you. Why wouldn't I?

25:19.603 --> 25:20.687
I was in love with you.

25:21.229 --> 25:22.647
And I fucking told you his name.

25:23.398 --> 25:26.443
It was the first time in my entire career
I revealed a client's name.

25:26.693 --> 25:27.693
I trusted you.

25:30.405 --> 25:33.325
Now I'm down here. The dead guy's up here.

25:35.452 --> 25:37.787
I'm sorry, Michael,
you hit a rough patch.

25:37.871 --> 25:39.039
"A rough..."

25:39.122 --> 25:43.126
A 300-pound investment banker's ass
exploded four bags of heroin

25:43.209 --> 25:44.711
in the backseat of my car last week.

25:44.794 --> 25:46.630
Those aren't leather seats,
those are cloth.

25:46.880 --> 25:48.566
- Okay, Michael...
- Want you to take a minute

25:48.590 --> 25:50.109
to think of what that clean-up might be.

25:50.133 --> 25:51.986
I don't have the time
for your insane shit, okay?

25:52.010 --> 25:53.345
At that point, you sell the car.

25:53.428 --> 25:54.822
- I never used you!
- The depreciation...

25:54.846 --> 25:56.056
I just left you!

26:00.352 --> 26:03.188
Because you couldn't forgive me
for something I didn't even do.

26:11.905 --> 26:12.989
Transport is in there.

26:16.951 --> 26:17.951
Is that blood, dude...

26:19.579 --> 26:21.373
What the fuck?

26:38.932 --> 26:41.142
You know how long
I've been waiting for this?

26:43.478 --> 26:44.771
Oh, no, no. I'm not gonna look.

26:46.690 --> 26:47.857
Motherfucker!

26:55.532 --> 26:59.035
Hey, hey, hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Let's talk about this, okay?

26:59.119 --> 27:03.581
Even a dumbass like you is smart enough
to keep one in the... pipe.

27:05.083 --> 27:06.126
Oh, shit.

27:07.001 --> 27:08.086
And nighty night.

27:09.295 --> 27:11.923
- Darius Kincaid. Jesus Christ.
- ...Michael.

27:12.006 --> 27:14.008
This is who you want me to protect?
My shirt!

27:15.552 --> 27:16.552
Fine, fine.

27:17.220 --> 27:18.847
You get the feet, I'll get the nostrils.

27:20.223 --> 27:22.475
<i>The trial
of former Belarusian President</i>

27:22.559 --> 27:25.895
<i>Vladislav Dukhovich
took an uncertain turn this week,</i>

27:26.146 --> 27:27.397
<i>having recently survived</i>

27:27.480 --> 27:31.192
<i>a dioxin poisoning attempt
that left his face disfigured.</i>

27:31.276 --> 27:34.362
<i>- Authorities are keeping Dukhovich...</i>
- Interpol wishes to have a word.

27:34.946 --> 27:36.948
Quite the dust-up in Coventry
this morning.

27:37.741 --> 27:39.821
But you wouldn't know anything
about that, would you?

27:42.537 --> 27:44.873
You've come here to lodge a complaint?

27:44.956 --> 27:48.126
I've come for my money.
I delivered as promised.

27:48.460 --> 27:50.962
I gave you Kincaid as exposed
as you'll ever get him.

27:51.921 --> 27:53.006
Small security detail,

27:53.256 --> 27:54.799
practically a rookie leading them.

27:55.216 --> 27:57.969
I can't do more than that.
Let's be fair here.

28:08.271 --> 28:11.775
You think it's fair
that you want something for nothing?

28:12.233 --> 28:14.611
In my country...

28:15.320 --> 28:17.572
...we would skin you like a cat.

28:18.323 --> 28:20.200
Would that be fair?

28:22.619 --> 28:26.748
I come from nothing. I work all my life...

28:27.165 --> 28:28.708
serving the people.

28:29.751 --> 28:31.920
And then they come into my country

28:32.003 --> 28:33.463
and they took it all away!

28:35.173 --> 28:37.717
And now they lock me up like a rat,

28:38.468 --> 28:39.719
feed me poison!

28:42.263 --> 28:43.263
Is this fair?

28:44.390 --> 28:46.267
When Kincaid is dead,

28:49.437 --> 28:50.772
you'll be paid in full.

28:53.942 --> 28:55.222
You know he's a murderer, right?

28:55.276 --> 28:56.736
You're playing nurse to a murderer.

28:56.820 --> 28:58.404
- A witness. Mmm-hmm.
- Really?

28:59.197 --> 29:00.197
Twenty-seven times.

29:01.074 --> 29:03.674
That's how many times this asshole
has tried to kill me, 27... 28!

29:03.952 --> 29:05.203
Fucking Prague!

29:05.912 --> 29:07.205
If Dukhovich is acquitted,

29:07.705 --> 29:09.165
he'll be back in power next week.

29:09.457 --> 29:10.583
I won't let that happen.

29:10.667 --> 29:11.667
Good.

29:12.043 --> 29:13.363
You should take him to The Hague.

29:13.545 --> 29:14.545
I can't!

29:14.587 --> 29:16.130
There's a mole inside Interpol.

29:16.339 --> 29:18.383
- It's already cost me 12 good officers.
- Good?

29:19.300 --> 29:22.428
That's subjective.
Nice. Maybe they were nice.

29:23.471 --> 29:26.558
I'll make it simple for you;
If I stay near him, they'll find him.

29:26.641 --> 29:29.310
So I gotta risk my life
protecting this coffin magnet over here?

29:29.394 --> 29:30.746
No, no, no. You gotta put something

29:30.770 --> 29:32.250
- in the pot.
- How about your career?

29:32.355 --> 29:33.898
- How about it?
- Your precious career.

29:33.982 --> 29:35.400
You do this job for me,

29:36.818 --> 29:38.653
and I'll get you back to elite status.

29:39.696 --> 29:40.976
Yeah, you don't have that power.

29:41.656 --> 29:42.740
I've got connections.

29:44.033 --> 29:45.702
You want back in? I can put you there.

29:45.785 --> 29:46.828
Why would I trust you?

29:49.038 --> 29:50.038
Why?

29:52.750 --> 29:54.502
Because I've never lied to you, Michael.

29:56.254 --> 29:59.173
You're terrible at almost everything,

30:00.550 --> 30:02.677
but you're good at keeping people alive.

30:03.303 --> 30:05.513
Keep him alive... please,

30:06.973 --> 30:08.808
and you get your dream life back.

30:09.976 --> 30:12.478
And as bonus,
you'll never hear from me again.

30:16.357 --> 30:17.357
Good.

30:22.697 --> 30:23.697
Still.

30:34.042 --> 30:35.126
<i>Where are you?</i>

30:35.209 --> 30:37.712
Setting up operation
at Coventry police headquarters.

30:37.921 --> 30:39.172
You got nothing from Dukhovich?

30:39.255 --> 30:40.340
Are you surprised?

30:40.423 --> 30:41.257
- Ma'am?
- Busy.

30:41.341 --> 30:43.277
I've picked up activity
at our safe house in town.

30:43.301 --> 30:44.981
Is this something
I need to know right now?

30:45.011 --> 30:46.971
No, not normally.
But, yes, it should be vacant.

30:47.055 --> 30:48.264
<i>And you believe it's not?</i>

30:48.348 --> 30:50.183
<i>Well, the access code
was activated</i>

30:50.266 --> 30:51.809
<i>without identity authorization.</i>

30:51.893 --> 30:53.394
Could Kincaid have gotten inside?

30:53.478 --> 30:55.021
But it's on a revolving encryption.

30:56.981 --> 30:58.399
Get a team over there. Now!

30:59.776 --> 31:01.194
And where is Agent Roussel?

31:01.861 --> 31:02.987
<i>Sorry, got to go.</i>

31:03.071 --> 31:04.071
Good luck.

31:11.621 --> 31:13.456
I believe I know where Kincaid is.

31:42.360 --> 31:43.861
What the fuck is all this?

31:44.112 --> 31:45.112
You're a fugitive.

31:45.530 --> 31:46.572
Fugitives wear restraints.

31:46.656 --> 31:48.116
No, no, no, not the cuffs.

31:48.199 --> 31:51.035
I'm talking about these whack-ass,
hipster clothes I'm wearing.

31:51.285 --> 31:52.485
Yeah, luckily I brought extra.

31:52.662 --> 31:54.080
Lucky for who?

31:55.289 --> 31:57.333
Shit. Am I wearing underwear?

31:57.542 --> 32:00.062
Those are for me too,
in case I have to change your pants again.

32:00.128 --> 32:01.379
Not a fan.

32:01.462 --> 32:03.631
You know they call them
swinging dicks for a reason.

32:04.090 --> 32:05.650
How about we never speak of this again?

32:10.388 --> 32:13.266
Shit. Interpol protocol.

32:13.891 --> 32:17.131
When that phone rings and nobody answers,
they're gonna send officers to the door.

32:18.646 --> 32:19.731
And there they are.

32:22.066 --> 32:23.386
Yes, we're setting our perimeter.

32:25.528 --> 32:26.528
Comfy?

32:26.696 --> 32:28.406
So, what happened
to little Miss Interpol?

32:28.906 --> 32:30.074
Agent Roussel's gone.

32:30.533 --> 32:33.536
Damn! I liked her. She's spunky.

32:34.203 --> 32:35.431
This building has two stairwells,

32:35.455 --> 32:36.724
- no fire escapes...
- No fire escapes

32:36.748 --> 32:38.166
and no adjacent rooftops.

32:38.249 --> 32:40.644
You know, you're not the only
observant motherfucker on the planet.

32:40.668 --> 32:41.836
I go through doors first.

32:41.919 --> 32:43.796
I check to see if it's clear,
then you follow.

32:43.880 --> 32:45.673
Really? You think that's necessary?

32:45.965 --> 32:49.927
- My job is to keep you out of harm's way.
- Shit, motherfucker.

32:50.928 --> 32:52.764
I am harm's way.

33:07.403 --> 33:08.905
Two hostiles, maybe more.

33:09.280 --> 33:10.740
I don't suppose I could have a gun?

33:10.823 --> 33:12.992
No. We're gonna take
the north stairwell. Let's go.

33:14.285 --> 33:15.285
Fuck!

33:21.584 --> 33:23.294
- It's him!
- Come on!

33:31.803 --> 33:32.803
Thank God you're here.

33:32.970 --> 33:34.770
I don't know
what I would've done without you.

33:34.889 --> 33:36.349
Well done. Guess what happens now?

33:37.100 --> 33:38.851
Shots fired! Shots fired!

33:53.658 --> 33:55.535
<i>All units sending in nine-nine.</i>

33:59.831 --> 34:01.082
Now we have a new problem.

34:02.166 --> 34:04.544
I like to keep things
a little more subtle.

34:14.971 --> 34:16.973
See? Boring is better.

34:21.226 --> 34:23.396
Okay. That's very loud.

34:24.522 --> 34:25.565
It was empty anyway.

34:30.194 --> 34:32.362
<i>We're identifying
heat signatures on the rooftop</i>

34:32.446 --> 34:33.781
<i>moving in a northbound direction.</i>

34:33.864 --> 34:35.867
Copy that! Go, go, go!
They're on the roof!

34:38.327 --> 34:40.246
No, no, no. No odds in that jump.

34:40.329 --> 34:42.558
It beats the hell out of whatever's
gonna come through that door.

34:42.581 --> 34:44.542
No. Just gotta...

34:45.751 --> 34:47.753
We just gotta find
a more intelligent way...

34:50.797 --> 34:53.676
Motherfucker! Ahh! Shit!

34:55.636 --> 34:57.096
Holy fucking shit.

34:57.180 --> 35:00.266
Secure the roof! Go, go, go!
Delta squad with me!

35:00.766 --> 35:02.560
- They're on the north side!
- Copy that!

35:10.401 --> 35:12.028
Made that jump on one leg.

35:12.320 --> 35:14.697
I made that jump
without jumping. Let's go.

35:15.281 --> 35:16.361
So, what's your next trick,

35:16.699 --> 35:18.534
showing me how we escape without escaping?

35:18.618 --> 35:21.258
Let's just try to get to the car
without killing anyone, all right?

35:21.871 --> 35:24.624
- Is this your car?
- One of them.

35:24.707 --> 35:26.334
I remember
shooting at you in a Jaguar.

35:26.417 --> 35:28.294
Buckle up. If we get
in a high-speed chase,

35:28.377 --> 35:29.295
I want you strapped in.

35:29.378 --> 35:31.547
I'm more worried
about the wheels coming off this bitch

35:31.631 --> 35:33.633
when you reach the speed limit.

35:34.967 --> 35:35.801
Back in the day,

35:35.885 --> 35:37.845
we wouldn't have even stolen
this piece of shit,

35:37.929 --> 35:39.889
and we stole everything.
I remember one night...

35:39.972 --> 35:42.558
I know all I need to know about you.
All your early arrests,

35:43.017 --> 35:45.662
your father in and out of prison,
you following in the same footsteps.

35:45.686 --> 35:47.939
Did your little research, did you?

35:48.481 --> 35:50.316
Prepare for a test,
there are no surprises.

35:51.317 --> 35:53.277
And you grew up wanting to be a cop

35:53.361 --> 35:55.363
till you found out
wasn't no money in that shit.

35:55.696 --> 35:58.074
So you joined the CIA,
sharpened your skills,

35:58.157 --> 35:59.867
then decided to open your own shop,

36:00.117 --> 36:01.911
pimp yourself out to the fat cats.

36:02.411 --> 36:04.789
I didn't even have to do
no research to know that shit.

36:05.456 --> 36:06.896
It's written all over your punk-ass.

36:07.959 --> 36:10.544
Can't wait to hear what I'll do next.
That's great.

36:11.754 --> 36:12.754
You know, why don't...

36:14.340 --> 36:16.318
Why don't you lay back
and keep from getting spotted.

36:16.342 --> 36:17.176
Get comfortable.

36:17.260 --> 36:19.553
That's a good idea.

36:23.683 --> 36:25.309
Smells like ass back here!

36:26.477 --> 36:28.604
Bet that Jag never smelled like ass.

36:30.314 --> 36:31.482
These your electrolytes?

37:00.594 --> 37:02.805
Facial recognition
identifies this man

37:02.888 --> 37:04.390
as Michael Bryce.

37:05.099 --> 37:07.226
But you already know that,
don't you, Agent Roussel?

37:08.185 --> 37:09.353
You two have a history.

37:10.313 --> 37:11.439
Long time ago.

37:11.939 --> 37:13.733
You slipped Kincaid
into our own safe house,

37:13.816 --> 37:14.984
then brought in this...

37:16.110 --> 37:17.695
Executive protection agent?

37:21.866 --> 37:24.660
Official channels had been compromised.
What did you expect me to do?

37:24.744 --> 37:27.163
Clearly, our office security's
been breached.

37:27.538 --> 37:30.624
The red notice stays.
You, however, can go.

37:31.250 --> 37:32.251
I'm placing you on leave.

37:32.543 --> 37:34.837
You will surrender
your weapon and credentials.

37:35.421 --> 37:36.922
You are going to be telling

37:37.006 --> 37:38.758
this story for years, Amelia,

37:39.592 --> 37:41.135
from inside a very large office

37:42.136 --> 37:43.387
or a very small cell.

37:43.721 --> 37:46.682
Well, I like my odds.

37:48.100 --> 37:50.340
The only way Bryce and Kincaid
don't make it to The Hague

37:50.978 --> 37:52.298
is if they kill each other first.

37:54.190 --> 37:55.190
Amelia.

37:56.609 --> 37:57.943
She's making a mistake.

37:58.444 --> 37:59.987
We need to plug our leak.

38:00.738 --> 38:03.115
Now, this Bryce, do you trust him?

38:03.949 --> 38:05.326
With something like this, yes.

38:06.786 --> 38:07.870
I'll speak to Casoria,

38:08.204 --> 38:10.456
get her to allow you to come
to The Hague with us.

38:11.082 --> 38:12.583
But no more secrets.

38:14.001 --> 38:15.002
Thank you, sir.

38:25.513 --> 38:27.848
Search for car, plate FJ56MHV.

38:28.265 --> 38:30.851
They'll have identified the car
with the traffic cams by now.

38:30.935 --> 38:33.354
And you. Welcome to fugitive life.

38:33.854 --> 38:34.939
Until I turn you in.

38:35.356 --> 38:37.233
Just need to find a different vehicle,

38:37.691 --> 38:40.569
older model, no alarm. Right here.

38:42.321 --> 38:44.156
Luckily, I came prepared.

38:46.867 --> 38:49.867
You know, if you're gonna be a while,
I can just go in there and get a room.

38:50.204 --> 38:51.539
There's an art to low-impact,

38:51.622 --> 38:54.917
high-efficiency
breaking and entering, but...

38:58.963 --> 38:59.964
Art's subjective.

39:01.090 --> 39:02.130
And you're bleeding again.

39:02.675 --> 39:04.528
You know, for a dude
that runs around killing people,

39:04.552 --> 39:06.595
you've got this really strange
thing about bleeding.

39:06.679 --> 39:09.849
It's inefficient.
And I don't kill people, I protect them.

39:09.932 --> 39:11.225
Hector Ramirez.

39:12.059 --> 39:14.979
Hector Ramirez was an assassin.

39:15.062 --> 39:16.397
Yeah, I know. I trained him.

39:16.480 --> 39:18.399
Who was holding a knife
to my client's throat.

39:18.482 --> 39:19.567
And you killed him.

39:19.817 --> 39:22.069
No. I saved my client.

39:22.361 --> 39:24.548
I think Hector might have
a different perspective on that.

39:24.572 --> 39:26.490
Oh, is that so? Well, here's the thing.

39:26.574 --> 39:28.659
I was a Triple-A rated
executive protection agent.

39:28.742 --> 39:31.162
- You just made up that Triple-A shit.
- No, I did not!

39:31.245 --> 39:33.122
And if guys like you...
If sociopaths like you

39:33.205 --> 39:36.017
weren't running around trying to kill
my clients, then no one would get hurt.

39:36.041 --> 39:38.520
Triple-A, yeah. It sounds like you ought
to be selling life insurance

39:38.544 --> 39:39.980
or fixing my fucking transmission,
or something.

39:40.004 --> 39:41.314
Well,
you're uninsurable, trust me.

39:41.338 --> 39:42.506
And you said "was."

39:42.590 --> 39:45.402
- "I was a Triple-A, X-rated dickhead!"
- No, I said "am." Get in the fucking car!

39:45.426 --> 39:46.886
Get in the fucking car!

39:50.598 --> 39:52.475
Jesus fucking Christ.

39:53.350 --> 39:55.394
You definitely said "was."

39:55.769 --> 39:57.229
"Was" as in,

39:57.605 --> 40:00.566
"I used to be a Triple-X
dickhead driving a Jag,

40:00.649 --> 40:02.568
but now I'm rolling around
in this shit-wagon."

40:02.651 --> 40:03.944
Put your seatbelt on.

40:04.028 --> 40:06.614
What happened? Lose your edge?

40:07.031 --> 40:11.076
Drop focus? You slip up
and let a client get popped?

40:11.160 --> 40:12.203
Never slipped up.

40:13.078 --> 40:15.539
Well, how did "am" become "was"?

40:16.916 --> 40:20.753
I don't actually know. I mean,
how does a so-called expert assassin

40:21.045 --> 40:23.214
get busted by Interpol?

40:23.506 --> 40:25.341
Love, baby. Straight-up love.

40:26.926 --> 40:29.512
<i>See, I'm doing
this job in Geneva, right?</i>

40:29.720 --> 40:31.514
<i>Some dude washing the wrong dude's money.</i>

40:31.597 --> 40:32.597
<i>I get a call.</i>

40:33.098 --> 40:33.933
What?

40:34.016 --> 40:35.434
<i>My wife's been in a car accident,</i>

40:35.518 --> 40:36.519
<i>- Bad one.</i>
- What?

40:36.602 --> 40:39.772
<i>So, Geneva dude gets a pass,
I jet back to Mexico City,</i>

40:39.855 --> 40:42.608
<i>go straight to the hospital.
Bopped up in Sonia's room,</i>

40:43.234 --> 40:44.902
<i>two dozen agents waiting for me.</i>

40:51.033 --> 40:52.033
Played by the heart.

40:52.785 --> 40:54.370
Happens to the best of us, man.

40:54.578 --> 40:57.498
I mean, sort of like how
Agent Roussel took you from here

40:58.040 --> 41:00.251
to here... to here.

41:00.501 --> 41:03.629
Assassin and eavesdropper.
You're a real double threat.

41:04.338 --> 41:07.150
Well, you were whining like a bitch
so loud, I heard you through the wall.

41:07.174 --> 41:09.093
Agent Roussel and I
aren't any of your concern.

41:09.176 --> 41:11.679
So, she dumped you because
of all your tight-assed,

41:12.263 --> 41:14.390
"Boring is good, look before you leap,

41:14.473 --> 41:15.492
put your seatbelt on" shit?

41:15.516 --> 41:16.433
She didn't dump me.

41:16.517 --> 41:19.353
Oh, motherfucker, I know she dumped you.

41:19.436 --> 41:21.522
I'm just perusing all the reasons why,

41:21.605 --> 41:23.732
and there's a plethora
of those motherfuckers.

41:24.692 --> 41:26.318
- Plethora?
- Yeah. It means a lot.

41:26.402 --> 41:29.071
I know what plethora means!
It just doesn't apply here!

41:30.364 --> 41:33.492
And not jumping off the top of a roof,
that's logical, that's safe.

41:33.576 --> 41:36.453
You know, wearing a seatbelt:
logical, safe.

41:37.454 --> 41:39.814
Let me ask you something,
how many times have you been shot?

41:40.541 --> 41:41.584
- Counting today?
- Yeah.

41:42.668 --> 41:44.253
- Too many to count. You?
- Yeah, I bet.

41:44.336 --> 41:45.336
Zero.

41:45.504 --> 41:47.131
Now, we both know that's bullshit.

41:47.214 --> 41:50.467
That's not bullshit, okay?
This was a little flesh wound.

41:50.551 --> 41:52.070
You just kind of zinged it right there.

41:52.094 --> 41:53.822
<i>Didn't even require a Band-Aid.
You got lucky.</i>

41:53.846 --> 41:56.807
<i>Yeah, the rock shifted
just as I took the shot.</i>

41:57.349 --> 41:59.101
<i>- You lucky motherfucker.</i>
- Fuck!

41:59.184 --> 42:00.184
Fuck!

42:00.686 --> 42:01.686
Fucking Prague.

42:02.605 --> 42:03.647
Yeah, Prague.

42:03.731 --> 42:05.211
You never even took one for a client?

42:05.399 --> 42:06.734
Nope. Never had to.

42:06.817 --> 42:08.402
Yeah, but the question is, would you?

42:08.485 --> 42:10.154
See, if I'm paying Triple-A rates,

42:10.237 --> 42:12.865
then I'm looking
for that full-service shit,

42:12.948 --> 42:13.948
you know what I'm saying?

42:14.241 --> 42:16.035
That extra "A" stands for "ass,"

42:16.410 --> 42:18.537
yours, between mine and a bullet.

42:18.621 --> 42:20.456
Being prepared for everything

42:20.539 --> 42:22.309
means that that situation statistically
just won't occur.

42:22.333 --> 42:24.418
Bryce, you cannot be
prepared for everything!

42:24.501 --> 42:26.420
Life is gonna bloody us up, okay?

42:26.879 --> 42:29.465
You just gotta put a Band-Aid
on that shit and keep rolling!

42:30.633 --> 42:31.884
That's really beautiful, man.

42:32.301 --> 42:35.387
Do you ever just write stuff down?
I don't know, throw down a haiku or two?

42:36.347 --> 42:41.935
<i>♪ Life is a highway

42:42.978 --> 42:45.939

How'd you like that, motherfucker?

43:49.753 --> 43:51.714
Do you have any idea how stupid you sound?

43:51.797 --> 43:53.465
I mean, what a fuck-up!

43:53.966 --> 43:56.260
You lost my husband, and you're like,

43:56.593 --> 43:58.929
"Can you please help us find him?"

43:59.012 --> 44:00.764
Why the fuck should I?

44:00.848 --> 44:03.517
That is your fucking job, motherfucker!

44:03.767 --> 44:05.644
But, obviously, you suck at it.

44:09.398 --> 44:12.443
You received
a phone call today from your attorney.

44:12.526 --> 44:13.526
So?

44:14.153 --> 44:16.155
Well, we asked your attorney,

44:16.238 --> 44:19.074
but... he said he didn't have
any contact with you.

44:19.533 --> 44:23.078
What? Are you fucking kidding me?

44:23.162 --> 44:25.956
Okay, that's it!
I've had it with this lawyer!

44:26.039 --> 44:29.460
He's an alcoholic.
He calls me completely drunk,

44:29.543 --> 44:32.254
and he starts saying
the most inappropriate things.

44:32.337 --> 44:36.133
Like, for example,
what he likes to do to his wife's ass.

44:36.592 --> 44:40.304
That is a disgusting place
to hide a child's toy!

44:40.387 --> 44:41.388
And you know what?

44:41.472 --> 44:43.474
I don't need to listen to this shit!

44:43.557 --> 44:45.184
Then he forgets about it,

44:45.267 --> 44:47.352
but I'm stuck with the images in my head!

44:47.436 --> 44:48.436
Mrs. Kincaid,

44:49.813 --> 44:51.398
if you know where your husband is,

44:51.482 --> 44:52.483
you need to tell us.

44:53.192 --> 44:54.318
It's for his own safety.

45:08.165 --> 45:12.836
I'm sorr... You're worried
about my husband's safety?

45:14.338 --> 45:18.008
No one in this world
can kill Darius Kincaid.

45:19.176 --> 45:21.386
The man is a <i>cucaracha,</i>

45:22.221 --> 45:24.389
and I mean that
in every sense of the word.

45:24.973 --> 45:29.770
Sometimes you just want to crush
his little, filthy head with your shoe,

45:30.562 --> 45:31.980
but he won't die.

45:32.272 --> 45:33.941
That motherfucker is unkillable,

45:34.149 --> 45:35.192
so you can relax.

45:37.945 --> 45:38.945
But wait, no.

45:39.530 --> 45:42.241
There is one important thing
that you should know.

45:50.457 --> 45:52.209
Motherfuckers, get out of my fucking cell.

45:54.169 --> 45:55.546
Great.

45:56.129 --> 45:57.129
Now!

45:57.256 --> 45:59.132
And I want that lawyer fired!

45:59.216 --> 46:02.511
I want that lawyer fired!
I want a good one, professional lawyer!

46:02.594 --> 46:04.471
I have rights! Human rights!

46:12.145 --> 46:13.981
Okay, you can take a five-minute break.

46:31.081 --> 46:32.081
Good evening.

46:33.542 --> 46:34.543
Can I help you?

46:34.626 --> 46:36.086
We need to see your cameras.

46:36.795 --> 46:39.214
Sorry, sir, that's for management only.

46:55.063 --> 46:56.063
I got you!

47:01.153 --> 47:02.153
Where we at?

47:03.030 --> 47:04.031
I backtracked west.

47:05.115 --> 47:06.283
West is the wrong direction.

47:06.575 --> 47:08.452
Thank you. Thank you.

47:08.994 --> 47:10.794
They'd be expecting us
to take a direct route.

47:10.913 --> 47:12.140
The fuck is that you're eating?

47:12.164 --> 47:13.164
Postpones fatigue.

47:13.999 --> 47:16.060
Refuels glycogen and electrolytes.
I got you one, too,

47:16.084 --> 47:18.170
while you were taking
one of your world-class naps.

47:18.253 --> 47:19.963
I'd stay awake if you let me drive.

47:20.297 --> 47:22.017
Thank you. That's really generous of... No!

47:24.676 --> 47:25.676
I gotta piss.

47:26.053 --> 47:26.887
Use that.

47:26.970 --> 47:28.597
Timeline's not built for another break.

47:30.140 --> 47:33.435
Your dick might fit
in here, but mine...

47:34.770 --> 47:37.814
Plus, I need every drop of this shit
to tolerate this ride with you.

47:38.523 --> 47:39.763
Just pull the fucking car over.

47:40.442 --> 47:41.610
Jesus Christ.

47:50.827 --> 47:52.829
It'd be a lot easier without these cuffs,

47:53.246 --> 47:54.498
or this fucking underwear.

48:15.644 --> 48:16.644
Kincaid!

48:18.981 --> 48:20.816
Hey, asshole!

48:20.899 --> 48:23.860
Ugh! Fucking God damn it, that's not mud!

48:31.159 --> 48:32.359
You think I'm a fucking idiot?

48:32.953 --> 48:33.953
Well...

48:35.330 --> 48:37.374
You did think that cheap whiskey was piss.

48:37.457 --> 48:38.709
Fuck!

48:40.168 --> 48:41.528
Where the hell did that come from?

48:41.753 --> 48:45.257
This is what happens
when you mess with a perfectly laid plan.

48:45.841 --> 48:48.552
- Give me a gun. Give me a goddamn gun!
- I got this! I got this!

48:52.389 --> 48:53.265
There's more than one.

48:53.348 --> 48:55.183
A-ha! Perfect deduction, Sherlock.

48:57.686 --> 48:59.438
Draw their fire so I can take a look.

48:59.730 --> 49:00.730
All right. Go!

49:03.817 --> 49:04.817
Ow!

49:05.277 --> 49:06.570
- Shit!
- Okay.

49:06.945 --> 49:09.740
Three shooters in a row, all lit up.

49:10.866 --> 49:12.159
So, what do you want to do?

49:15.454 --> 49:17.873
While you can't come up with a plan,
they're gonna kill us.

49:18.206 --> 49:19.958
So here's the plan.

49:20.625 --> 49:23.086
- What the fuck?
- You take eleven o'clock, I'll take one.

49:23.462 --> 49:24.921
Let's see who gets to twelve first.

49:25.464 --> 49:27.799
Okay. On three. You ready?

49:28.508 --> 49:29.508
One...

49:38.060 --> 49:39.686
I said on three. You shot early.

49:39.770 --> 49:40.937
Yeah, before they did.

49:41.146 --> 49:42.146
Let me break it down...

49:54.451 --> 49:57.537
So much for your intricately
calculated travel plans.

49:57.996 --> 49:59.796
That's why I was trying
to bounce on your ass.

49:59.873 --> 50:01.083
See, I'm safer on my own.

50:01.333 --> 50:02.918
There's no way that they could've known

50:03.001 --> 50:05.253
- where we were.
- Well, they did, and now they're dead.

50:09.883 --> 50:11.323
This yours? Is this your cell phone?

50:11.802 --> 50:13.595
I might've taken that off some dead merc.

50:13.929 --> 50:14.929
You might've...

50:15.430 --> 50:16.950
You know, they can track a cell phone.

50:17.516 --> 50:21.478
That's why I use a ghost chip in mine,
so they can't track the phone.

50:21.812 --> 50:23.730
I mean, that's how they know
where we were!

50:24.564 --> 50:26.650
Here I am, I'm plotting courses
all over the country,

50:26.733 --> 50:29.694
and you're carrying a location beacon
in your pocket!

50:30.654 --> 50:31.654
My bad.

50:31.863 --> 50:32.863
Your bad?

50:33.448 --> 50:36.493
You don't even understand how
21st century technology works! I mean,

50:36.576 --> 50:38.829
how have you stayed alive this long?

50:38.912 --> 50:43.875
While all you guys are wasting your time
planning and aiming and deducing,

50:44.167 --> 50:45.168
I just do my thing,

50:45.502 --> 50:48.755
and my thing has always been better
than your fucking thing.

50:49.422 --> 50:50.841
Great. There you go.

50:52.092 --> 50:52.926
That's just great.

50:53.009 --> 50:55.428
I'm glad that your thing has
always been better than mine.

50:57.389 --> 50:58.574
You're not gonna take this gun?

50:58.598 --> 51:00.517
No, you keep that gun.
Use it to shoot me.

51:00.600 --> 51:02.400
No, no, no, I was gonna
shoot you with this...

51:03.478 --> 51:04.478
Shit!

51:14.239 --> 51:15.239
There go the guns.

51:15.824 --> 51:17.075
Well, look on the bright side.

51:18.076 --> 51:19.411
We get the bad guys' van.

51:40.807 --> 51:42.392
This field smells like your car.

51:44.436 --> 51:46.771
Dude, I said I was sorry about the phone.

51:47.564 --> 51:49.244
Who knows, maybe
your plan would've worked.

51:51.234 --> 51:53.087
- So, what about your other plan?
- There's no plan!

51:53.111 --> 51:55.864
The plan is we're in a cow pasture,
that's the plan.

51:56.239 --> 51:58.408
I'm talking about your Agent Roussel plan.

51:58.867 --> 52:00.952
That's why you're doing this, right?
Get her back?

52:03.038 --> 52:06.041
You think becoming
a Triple-A card-carrying dickhead

52:06.124 --> 52:09.961
is gonna give you an all-access
backstage pass to Agent Roussel's ass,

52:10.295 --> 52:12.005
- and she'll fall in love.
- I get it.

52:12.088 --> 52:14.317
- You're gonna be the guy...
- And your life will have meaning again.

52:14.341 --> 52:16.444
...that the other inmates come to
for advice. They're very lucky.

52:16.468 --> 52:18.678
Motherfucker, please.

52:19.346 --> 52:22.140
I've eaten hamburgers
that know more about women than you.

52:22.557 --> 52:25.852
- You, my friend, are a romantic retard.
- Hey!

52:26.645 --> 52:28.188
Just 'cause I want to get my business

52:28.271 --> 52:30.311
back in order, that doesn't make me
a shitty person.

52:30.732 --> 52:34.569
And Amelia has nothing,
absolutely nothing, to do with this.

52:35.862 --> 52:39.616
Oh man. You are so in love, it is crazy.

52:39.699 --> 52:41.243
Christ, do you ever shut up?

52:42.827 --> 52:44.746
Why is everything always
about love with you?

52:45.247 --> 52:46.623
Well, what else is there?

52:47.290 --> 52:52.295
I mean, take away the guns, the money,
the travel, the perfect shot

52:52.379 --> 52:55.173
through a motherfucker's
earhole from 300 meters.

52:56.341 --> 52:59.177
I mean, none of that shit means dick
if I can't tell Sonia about it.

52:59.970 --> 53:02.180
Well, I guess Amelia's
just not as special as Sonia.

53:02.264 --> 53:03.515
She sounds great.

53:04.266 --> 53:05.809
- What, she cheat on you?
- No.

53:06.184 --> 53:07.894
- Try to kill you?
- No.

53:07.978 --> 53:10.855
'Cause Sonia chopped off part of my ear
with a machete one time.

53:10.939 --> 53:12.816
She sewed it back on, but...

53:13.733 --> 53:16.278
it was two, three days before
our shit got real again.

53:17.362 --> 53:18.922
Where'd you guys meet, ChristianMingle?

53:18.947 --> 53:20.490
No. A bar in Honduras.

53:21.283 --> 53:24.703
One of those places
where nobody knows your face and name.

53:27.956 --> 53:29.124

55:18.525 --> 55:19.525
Need a ride?

55:19.692 --> 55:21.945
Yeah. We're trying to catch
a ferry to Amsterdam.

55:22.362 --> 55:23.672
- Yeah, I can get you there.
- Yeah?

55:23.696 --> 55:24.531
Jump in.

55:24.614 --> 55:27.409
Hey, hey, hey, there's eyes
all over Amsterdam for me.

55:27.492 --> 55:28.594
That's where Sonia's locked up.

55:28.618 --> 55:30.578
It's a quick in and out.
I got a place there.

55:30.662 --> 55:32.205
- You got a place in Amsterdam?
- Yeah.

55:32.705 --> 55:33.945
Is that where you keep the Jag?

55:34.624 --> 55:36.384
You know what?
Why don't you go fuck yourself

55:36.459 --> 55:38.336
and the horse you... Hello.

55:41.673 --> 55:43.049
Hello, beautiful Sisters.

55:47.929 --> 55:49.139
Whose lap will I sit on?

57:13.723 --> 57:14.723
One more!

57:24.943 --> 57:25.985
Your stop, boys!

57:28.488 --> 57:30.907
You take care, sisters.

57:31.658 --> 57:32.825
Bye, Kincaid!

57:35.286 --> 57:37.163
Go with God!

57:37.664 --> 57:39.958
This man's killed over 150 people.

57:40.041 --> 57:41.292
Two-fifty, easy.

57:42.168 --> 57:43.169
Yeah, but they love you.

57:43.962 --> 57:45.713
Me, they want to perform an exorcism on.

57:46.714 --> 57:47.834
Question for a higher power.

57:49.133 --> 57:50.176
Who is more wicked,

57:50.969 --> 57:52.804
he who kills evil motherfuckers

57:53.555 --> 57:54.764
or he who protects them?

58:07.694 --> 58:09.254
You really believe you're the good guy?

58:16.786 --> 58:19.247
My first contract... I was...

58:20.415 --> 58:21.833
I don't know, 16, 17.

58:23.459 --> 58:26.379
<i>There was a guy who broke into a church.</i>

58:27.922 --> 58:30.425
<i>The preacher was still there,
so he told the guy,</i>

58:30.508 --> 58:33.303
<i>"Look, you don't have to steal anything.
Take whatever you want."</i>

58:34.762 --> 58:36.002
<i>Dude wasn't there for the loot.</i>

58:36.514 --> 58:37.599
<i>He wanted to hurt somebody.</i>

58:44.105 --> 58:44.939
<i>Slaughters the preacher,</i>

58:45.023 --> 58:48.568
<i>displays his body on the altar

58:59.787 --> 59:03.207
<i>The Bible says never to take revenge,</i>

59:05.710 --> 59:06.794

59:10.465 --> 59:12.258
<i>But I wasn't prepared to wait that long.</i>

59:28.232 --> 59:32.612
So, when your moral compass
gets around to pointing at me,

59:33.613 --> 59:36.699
yeah, you'll be pointing
at one of the good guys.

59:38.242 --> 59:40.082
And how does one
of the good guys get connected

59:40.119 --> 59:41.559
with a piece of shit like Dukhovich?

59:42.455 --> 59:44.135
I didn't know everything
the dude was into.

59:44.290 --> 59:45.290
That's an easy excuse.

59:45.333 --> 59:47.561
Look, you know everything
about every client you ever had?

59:47.585 --> 59:50.672
Nope. I don't decide
whether my clients live or die.

When's the last time you paid rent
on this safe house?

01:00:31.421 --> 01:00:34.132
I haven't done a lot
of Amsterdam jobs lately.

01:00:34.966 --> 01:00:36.217
I just need to get my gear.

01:00:36.300 --> 01:00:40.054
The problem is that...
all the windows are polycarb.

01:00:40.138 --> 01:00:42.765
They have... extra layers of laminate,

01:00:43.766 --> 01:00:45.452
and obviously there's
a Hetzger alarm system,

01:00:45.476 --> 01:00:47.186
which is the premiere unit on the market.

01:00:48.312 --> 01:00:49.689
It's got three fail-safes.

01:00:50.606 --> 01:00:53.067
But if I can just...

01:00:59.699 --> 01:01:00.783
What the...

01:01:01.159 --> 01:01:03.578
- Jesus Christ!
- Nope. Darius Kincaid.

01:01:05.163 --> 01:01:07.498
But there are no words. I am amazing.

01:01:10.209 --> 01:01:11.711
That's so cute!

01:01:12.211 --> 01:01:13.755
You look so happy here.

01:01:16.966 --> 01:01:18.259
So, is Agent Roussel

01:01:18.342 --> 01:01:20.470
the only photograph-worthy
girl in your life?

01:01:20.928 --> 01:01:21.929
Been busy working.

01:01:24.056 --> 01:01:25.266
Whoa!

01:01:25.641 --> 01:01:27.393
You must give me your designer's number.

01:01:27.685 --> 01:01:29.812
We got four hours to court,
let's get cleaned up.

01:01:29.896 --> 01:01:31.814
I need to change my bandage
and take a shower.

01:01:31.898 --> 01:01:33.458
The hot water still work in this bitch?

01:01:33.524 --> 01:01:34.524
Upstairs.

01:01:35.860 --> 01:01:37.445
- Elevator?
- No!

01:01:37.528 --> 01:01:38.528
Fuck!

01:01:41.657 --> 01:01:43.409
Counsel, approach the bench.

01:01:44.285 --> 01:01:46.204
How can you allow Kincaid's testimony?

01:01:46.871 --> 01:01:49.415
A hired killer given a sweetheart deal.

01:01:50.166 --> 01:01:52.752
A man like that will say
anything to save himself.

01:01:52.835 --> 01:01:54.462
Kincaid has no sweetheart deal.

01:01:55.087 --> 01:01:56.714
His wife will go free, not him.

01:02:02.386 --> 01:02:03.805
The testimony will be allowed,

01:02:04.305 --> 01:02:06.891
assuming you produce
your witness by 5:00 p.m.

01:02:13.940 --> 01:02:16.418
- Michael, you should've been here by now.
- Yeah. Just a couple of bumps.

01:02:16.442 --> 01:02:17.276
We're on our way.

01:02:17.360 --> 01:02:18.921
<i>The judge isn't giving us any wiggle room.</i>

01:02:18.945 --> 01:02:20.613
You have less than four hours now!

01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:22.880
<i>Well, we're gonna be there in half that.</i>

01:02:23.825 --> 01:02:24.945
Then why are you calling me?

01:02:27.203 --> 01:02:28.287
Right. Well...

01:02:31.082 --> 01:02:33.459
I'm calling you because
I've been thinking, and...

01:02:37.922 --> 01:02:38.922
I forgive you.

01:02:42.635 --> 01:02:43.635
Yeah.

01:02:44.887 --> 01:02:45.972
It feels good to say that.

01:02:49.392 --> 01:02:50.393
I forgive you, Amelia.

01:02:52.144 --> 01:02:53.771
Are you fucking kidding me?

01:02:54.146 --> 01:02:55.146
What?

01:02:55.356 --> 01:02:56.858
You're seriously doing this now?

01:02:57.108 --> 01:02:59.026
- No. What?
<i>- And forgive me for what?</i>

01:02:59.652 --> 01:03:02.297
- There's nothing to forgive!
- No, no, no, look, I thought that you...

01:03:02.321 --> 01:03:05.157
- Just get Kincaid here!
- Fucking prick!

01:03:16.711 --> 01:03:17.711
Darius?

01:03:28.472 --> 01:03:29.472
Fuck!

01:03:34.020 --> 01:03:36.022
Yeah. We've got the whole area covered.

01:03:36.564 --> 01:03:38.357
If Kincaid shows up, he's ours.

01:03:42.737 --> 01:03:43.737
<i>Stay alert.</i>

Couldn't you just had
the flowers delivered?

01:06:14.180 --> 01:06:15.473
Needed a personal touch.

01:06:15.681 --> 01:06:17.242
You were about to get
his personal touch,

01:06:17.266 --> 01:06:18.184
if I hadn't followed you.

01:06:18.267 --> 01:06:19.185
All right, I appreciate you.

01:06:19.268 --> 01:06:21.288
And the guys who started
tracking you a few blocks ago.

01:06:21.312 --> 01:06:23.064
You mean the guy you snatched in the bush,

01:06:23.147 --> 01:06:24.907
and the two you left
knocked out in the park?

01:06:25.399 --> 01:06:27.318
Like I said, I appreciate you.

01:06:27.651 --> 01:06:29.987
Okay, so if you knew
that they were out there,

01:06:30.071 --> 01:06:32.656
but you still felt it was important
to deliver these flowers?

01:06:34.200 --> 01:06:36.035
Sonia's gonna really love those flowers.

01:06:36.118 --> 01:06:37.787
I sure fucking hope so.

01:06:37.870 --> 01:06:40.247
Now, this is as close
as I'm gonna be to her

01:06:40.664 --> 01:06:41.707
for a very long time.

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:44.418
It had to be special.

01:06:46.837 --> 01:06:47.837
First.

01:06:49.090 --> 01:06:51.634
I'm first. Look... You were saying?

01:06:52.510 --> 01:06:53.510
Tell me something.

01:06:53.594 --> 01:06:55.221
The day you and Agent Roussel

01:06:55.304 --> 01:06:56.972
took that picture I saw in your place,

01:06:57.348 --> 01:06:59.948
what kind of things would you have done
for her to make her happy?

01:07:00.893 --> 01:07:03.312
Anything. I loved her. Trusted her.

01:07:04.313 --> 01:07:06.190
She sold me out. Case closed.

01:07:06.440 --> 01:07:10.528
Well, that's cold. Maybe, just maybe,

01:07:11.237 --> 01:07:12.738
you ought to give her a pass on this.

01:07:13.614 --> 01:07:15.449
I mean, I gotta tell you, honestly,

01:07:16.325 --> 01:07:18.661
there's not a lot of women
who'd put up with your shit.

01:07:19.662 --> 01:07:20.955
That's inspirational, thank you.

01:07:21.038 --> 01:07:23.624
What I meant to say:
there's no women who would put up with it.

01:07:23.999 --> 01:07:25.477
- That's better.
- You're an annoying motherfucker

01:07:25.501 --> 01:07:26.661
with all your rules and shit.

01:07:26.710 --> 01:07:29.880
I mean, if she can put up with that,
she must be a pretty special girl.

01:07:32.591 --> 01:07:33.591
She is.

01:07:35.344 --> 01:07:37.346
You know, I told her today
that I forgave her.

01:07:37.680 --> 01:07:40.683
Really? And how'd that go?

01:07:41.100 --> 01:07:42.100
Hard to tell.

01:07:42.309 --> 01:07:44.603
You know, women don't like
to be forgiven for shit

01:07:45.020 --> 01:07:47.231
'cause that implies they did
some shit to begin with.

01:07:49.150 --> 01:07:50.776
I should just forget about Kurosawa.

01:07:51.318 --> 01:07:53.237
- What?
- Takashi Kurosawa.

01:07:54.738 --> 01:07:57.575
He was my client, she exposed him,
and he got killed.

01:08:02.830 --> 01:08:03.830
Something funny?

01:08:05.666 --> 01:08:08.127
She didn't expose your client!

01:08:08.210 --> 01:08:09.795
I popped Kurosawa!

01:08:11.463 --> 01:08:13.465
<i>I was at the airport for another target.</i>

01:08:13.549 --> 01:08:14.925
<i>I spotted him by accident.</i>

01:08:15.134 --> 01:08:17.469
<i>Lucky for me. Him, not so much.</i>

01:08:18.220 --> 01:08:20.430
<i>Doubled my money
on that corrupt Asian motherfucker.</i>

01:08:33.777 --> 01:08:36.404
Hey, I thought you knew
I was the one who popped him.

01:08:45.372 --> 01:08:46.372
I...

01:08:48.500 --> 01:08:51.712
- Shit! What the fuck, Bryce! Mother...
- We're done!

01:08:51.795 --> 01:08:53.380
That shit was two years ago, man.

01:08:53.464 --> 01:08:54.944
You gonna be a little bitch about it?

01:08:55.006 --> 01:08:55.883
You're on your own!

01:08:55.966 --> 01:08:58.135
Well, good! I'll be safer on my own!

01:08:58.219 --> 01:09:00.720
You won't last one hour without me!
You'll be dead in a minute!

01:09:00.804 --> 01:09:03.765
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you're about as useful
as a condom in a convent.

01:09:04.058 --> 01:09:06.518
- Eat my ass!
- That's what she said!

01:09:06.602 --> 01:09:09.145
- Suck it! Suck it!
- Fuck you!

01:09:09.897 --> 01:09:11.314

01:10:09.707 --> 01:10:11.166
I hope they kill him. I really do.

01:10:11.875 --> 01:10:12.875
Okay.

01:10:16.588 --> 01:10:20.092
Even if I did save him, again,
you know what he'd say?

01:10:20.175 --> 01:10:22.415
He'd say, "I had it all
figured out before you got here."

01:10:26.598 --> 01:10:28.058
He'd say, "I guess my thing

01:10:28.142 --> 01:10:30.185

01:10:33.439 --> 01:10:36.066

I was up here.

01:10:56.545 --> 01:10:57.545
I was up here.

01:10:59.131 --> 01:11:00.382
And God damn it!

01:11:04.386 --> 01:11:05.554
Pass me the magazine.

01:11:17.691 --> 01:11:18.691
There he is!

01:11:31.580 --> 01:11:32.831

Go, go, go, go, go!

01:13:06.925 --> 01:13:07.968
Turn!

01:13:32.618 --> 01:13:33.994
He's getting away!

01:13:56.600 --> 01:13:57.601
Watch out!

01:14:04.608 --> 01:14:05.901
To the right!

01:14:09.988 --> 01:14:12.032
- Drop your weapon!
- This way!

01:14:14.952 --> 01:14:15.952
Fuck!

01:14:17.287 --> 01:14:18.872
Hey, Interpol! Interpol!

01:14:25.629 --> 01:14:26.629
Fuck!

01:14:34.471 --> 01:14:35.471
Shit!

01:15:05.544 --> 01:15:06.628
Hurry!

01:15:39.745 --> 01:15:40.912
Fuck!

01:16:23.288 --> 01:16:24.288

01:16:53.485 --> 01:16:54.528
Okay.

01:17:03.453 --> 01:17:05.705
A loose helmet
is like wearing no helmet at all.

01:17:06.706 --> 01:17:09.376
It's not a button strap. It's a D-ring.

01:17:09.835 --> 01:17:12.462
Just unthread it through
the thing. It's very simple.

01:17:13.213 --> 01:17:16.007
Well... Or there's...
There's that shortcut.

01:17:31.606 --> 01:17:34.693
I ask you one time, polite.

01:17:35.402 --> 01:17:37.863
Where is Kincaid?

01:17:40.740 --> 01:17:42.159
Honestly, I'd tell you if I knew.

01:17:43.410 --> 01:17:45.745
You have my word. Look at my right hand.

01:17:46.788 --> 01:17:48.999
See that? That's a Boy Scout salute.

01:17:49.958 --> 01:17:50.959
We're sworn to never lie.

01:17:51.042 --> 01:17:52.669
I've taken an oath, so you can trust...

01:17:53.462 --> 01:17:56.339
Right in the fucking ear!

01:17:59.384 --> 01:18:00.760
Really? Waterboarding? Really?

01:18:01.636 --> 01:18:03.805
I was in the CIA. You know,
we don't do that anymore.

01:18:06.057 --> 01:18:08.518
Okay. Hey, hey. Hold it.
Whoa, whoa. Wait, wait, wait.

01:18:08.768 --> 01:18:11.021
Here's what we learned.
The key to interrogation

01:18:11.229 --> 01:18:12.481
is establishing a bond

01:18:12.898 --> 01:18:15.317
between the interrogator
and the subject, okay?

01:18:15.400 --> 01:18:17.986
You know, just sort of
like a rapport, okay?

01:18:18.069 --> 01:18:21.907
You need me to like you.
You need me to like you, okay?

01:18:21.990 --> 01:18:23.617
You need me to like you!

01:18:34.044 --> 01:18:35.295
I really don't like you.

01:18:37.005 --> 01:18:38.465
Okay, okay, okay.

01:18:47.474 --> 01:18:49.100
Where is Kincaid?

01:18:49.601 --> 01:18:51.770

No, it was all my fault.

01:20:38.877 --> 01:20:42.505
No... I did it all to myself.

01:20:42.589 --> 01:20:44.799
Bryce, please! Come on,
you didn't do it to yourself.

01:20:44.883 --> 01:20:46.635
That's life. Life happens.

01:20:47.135 --> 01:20:48.428
Life without Amelia.

01:20:50.764 --> 01:20:53.183
Hey, still time to work that shit out.

01:20:55.769 --> 01:20:57.479
So, how'd you and Agent Roussel meet?

01:21:01.232 --> 01:21:02.232
On a job.

01:21:04.027 --> 01:21:05.027
She was...

01:21:06.821 --> 01:21:08.698
She was working an undercover op,

01:21:10.158 --> 01:21:11.158
very badly.

01:21:16.206 --> 01:21:18.166

01:21:38.812 --> 01:21:41.940

shady and mayonnaise-chugging brother.</i>

01:21:42.315 --> 01:21:46.986

There's a couple of ringers in the game.

Yeah. I guarantee
you if that smells like ass,

01:25:04.517 --> 01:25:05.852

- Oh yeah.

- I will bust a cap in your ass,
- The clutch...

01:25:54.233 --> 01:25:55.513

for, um, for everything.

01:26:50.415 --> 01:26:52.333

Suspicious vehicle
is approaching, Commander.

01:35:24.094 --> 01:35:25.221
Stop the car!

01:35:28.849 --> 01:35:29.849
What's going on here?

01:35:33.395 --> 01:35:34.835
Is this what we've been waiting for?

01:35:37.733 --> 01:35:38.733
Shit.

01:35:47.660 --> 01:35:49.662
I got your witness, Darius Kincaid.

01:35:51.080 --> 01:35:52.080
Follow me.

01:35:55.834 --> 01:35:57.127
Obviously, Your Honor,

01:35:57.211 --> 01:36:00.881
this has devolved into a complete waste
of my client's time.

01:36:01.257 --> 01:36:03.217
The prosecution has no witness to present.

01:36:06.262 --> 01:36:07.822
Can you empty
your pockets, please, sir.

01:36:14.353 --> 01:36:15.938
Are you kidding me? Come on!

01:36:19.858 --> 01:36:21.986
As we seem to be reaching our deadline,

01:36:22.069 --> 01:36:26.657
I have no choice but to declare
that this trial has come to its natural...

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:39.128
Your Honor, I present Darius Kincaid.

01:36:39.211 --> 01:36:40.713
The deadline has passed!

01:36:40.796 --> 01:36:44.133
I believe we still had
a few seconds on the clock.

01:36:45.759 --> 01:36:46.759
How do I look?

01:36:46.969 --> 01:36:48.762
You got a little speck of blood on your...

01:36:49.972 --> 01:36:50.972
everywhere.

01:36:51.932 --> 01:36:54.351
Will the prosecution
please prepare their witness.

01:36:54.435 --> 01:36:56.020
- Hi.
- My God, are you okay?

01:36:56.437 --> 01:36:58.939
Yeah. There's your guy.

01:37:00.774 --> 01:37:02.484
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

01:37:04.236 --> 01:37:05.356
By the way, bumping into you

01:37:05.404 --> 01:37:07.084
is the best thing
that ever happened to me.

01:37:13.996 --> 01:37:15.956
Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth,

01:37:16.040 --> 01:37:17.124
and nothing but the truth?

01:37:17.958 --> 01:37:18.958
Yeah.

01:37:21.003 --> 01:37:23.172
Your name is Darius Kincaid?

01:37:23.756 --> 01:37:27.134
No. My real name is Darius Evans.

01:37:28.052 --> 01:37:29.678
My parents separated when I was six.

01:37:30.012 --> 01:37:32.514
My mother remarried
a real mean piece of work

01:37:33.015 --> 01:37:34.683
named Roger Kincaid.

01:37:35.059 --> 01:37:36.727
She figured if I took his name,

01:37:37.269 --> 01:37:38.771
he'd keep his belt on more often.

01:37:39.146 --> 01:37:41.023
Plan didn't work so well,
but the name stuck.

01:37:41.732 --> 01:37:45.110
My real father's name
is Maurice Evans, preacher.

01:37:45.611 --> 01:37:47.738
He was killed a few years later
in his own church.

01:37:48.656 --> 01:37:49.573
I'm sorry, I didn't...

01:37:49.657 --> 01:37:51.825
That's all right.
Can't research everything.

01:37:52.159 --> 01:37:56.538
Mr. Kincaid, were you ever
in the employ of Vladislav Dukhovich?

01:37:58.290 --> 01:38:00.376
No.
Have you ever met Dukhovich?

01:38:01.168 --> 01:38:05.255
Yes. April 17, 2012,
he invited me to his palace.

01:38:06.924 --> 01:38:10.177
<i>Prosecution Exhibit
17-D, palace security logs.</i>

01:38:11.303 --> 01:38:13.681
<i>Did he offer you employment then?</i>

01:38:14.431 --> 01:38:15.431
<i>Yes, he did.</i>

01:38:16.809 --> 01:38:20.521
<i>He wanted me to take out
a political rival exiled in the UK.</i>

01:38:22.856 --> 01:38:24.316
<i>- I refused.
- Why?</i>

01:38:24.900 --> 01:38:26.735
<i>Because while I was
there, he ordered his men</i>

01:38:26.819 --> 01:38:28.946
<i>to slaughter a village outside Polotsk.</i>

01:38:32.032 --> 01:38:33.784
I'm not down with killing innocent people.

01:38:34.118 --> 01:38:35.994
And do you have evidence
to corroborate this?

01:38:36.578 --> 01:38:37.578
Yeah.

01:38:39.248 --> 01:38:42.167
Go to FTP site Raven 257.

01:38:43.919 --> 01:38:44.962
Just load it up.

01:38:45.963 --> 01:38:47.089
Exhibit 18-D.

01:38:47.172 --> 01:38:48.716
We've confirmed the coordinates.

01:38:49.425 --> 01:38:50.509
It's asking for a password.

01:38:51.093 --> 01:38:52.761
Sorry. Password...

01:38:52.845 --> 01:38:54.888
"Dukhovich is a dick," all caps,

01:38:55.431 --> 01:38:57.057
except "dick" is lower case.

01:39:00.060 --> 01:39:01.895
I wasn't gonna trust
Interpol with this shit.

01:39:13.824 --> 01:39:14.825
Order!

01:39:18.912 --> 01:39:20.330
Order!

01:39:25.461 --> 01:39:26.461
Order in the court!

01:39:27.838 --> 01:39:28.838
Your Honors,

01:39:30.048 --> 01:39:34.386
I could save us all some time.
May I address the court?

01:39:38.056 --> 01:39:41.143
For months, I have been
sitting in this chair,

01:39:41.226 --> 01:39:46.106
nodding along to this ludicrous charade.

01:39:46.190 --> 01:39:47.190
Excuse me.

01:39:47.566 --> 01:39:49.026
My excellent attorney was hoping

01:39:49.109 --> 01:39:51.195
for the legitimacy of a formal acquittal,

01:39:51.278 --> 01:39:53.280
but that is no longer possible.

01:39:53.363 --> 01:39:54.490
Thank you, Darius.

01:39:55.824 --> 01:39:58.660
So, let us now end the charade.

01:39:59.328 --> 01:40:01.330
The charges against me

01:40:02.664 --> 01:40:04.166
are entirely correct.

01:40:05.876 --> 01:40:09.379
I am the rightful ruler of Belarus!

01:40:10.005 --> 01:40:12.883
- Sit down! Order!
- As the ruler of my nation,

01:40:12.966 --> 01:40:16.386
I will do as I wish without exception,
without apology.

01:40:16.470 --> 01:40:18.847
- Sit down! Order!
- I recognize no authority

01:40:18.931 --> 01:40:21.091
- that limits my power!
- Mr. Dukhovich, I order you...

01:40:24.228 --> 01:40:25.270
Assistant Director.

01:40:25.354 --> 01:40:26.647
Go do your job, Amelia!

01:40:28.565 --> 01:40:30.442
In this trial...

01:40:30.526 --> 01:40:34.279
the world community
is attempting to make a statement!

01:40:34.363 --> 01:40:37.658
Well, now I would like to make
a statement of my own!

01:40:42.996 --> 01:40:43.997
Show me your phone.

01:40:47.918 --> 01:40:51.713
I recognize no authority
that limits my powers!

01:41:03.934 --> 01:41:05.477
Everybody go!

01:41:11.483 --> 01:41:15.529
I will now take my leave
with my dignity intact!

01:41:41.179 --> 01:41:44.641
Now, that's what
I call Triple-A service.

01:41:45.601 --> 01:41:46.601
Fuck!

01:41:48.103 --> 01:41:51.398
Fuck! Medic! Medic!
I need a medic over here!

01:41:52.316 --> 01:41:54.109
- Lockdown protocol!
- Don't move!

01:42:05.954 --> 01:42:09.499
<i>We're here live in front

01:42:23.764 --> 01:42:25.223
Bryce! Focus on me.

01:42:25.307 --> 01:42:27.184
I'd really rather not.

01:42:27.559 --> 01:42:32.397
...<i>in effect.

01:42:33.273 --> 01:42:36.151

01:42:36.568 --> 01:42:38.695
I did my job. You go do yours.

01:42:39.488 --> 01:42:41.323
Gotta go get that motherfucker!

01:42:45.494 --> 01:42:46.662

Officer, the building is in lockdown.

01:43:05.097 --> 01:43:06.473
Dukhovich does not leave his cell.

01:43:12.604 --> 01:43:13.604
Let's go!

01:43:31.623 --> 01:43:33.166
It's over, Assistant Director.

01:43:33.250 --> 01:43:34.668
Give up.

01:44:15.625 --> 01:44:19.171
I didn't want to do this, Amelia.
I swear to you.

01:44:48.617 --> 01:44:49.617
Fuck!

01:44:58.168 --> 01:45:01.338
Michael! Michael!

01:45:04.049 --> 01:45:06.968
- Michael, you hear me?
- Are you okay? Yeah?

01:45:07.052 --> 01:45:08.845
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Good, good, good.

01:45:08.929 --> 01:45:09.930
- You?
- Yeah.

01:45:10.347 --> 01:45:12.516
Oh, no. You're bleeding.

01:45:12.599 --> 01:45:14.976
Oh, no, no, no.

01:45:19.481 --> 01:45:20.481
I'll get some help.

01:45:22.317 --> 01:45:23.317
Stay here.

01:45:33.954 --> 01:45:34.954
Hey!

01:45:35.247 --> 01:45:36.373
Hey!

01:46:07.445 --> 01:46:08.989
Up on the ledge, Dookie man.

01:46:12.534 --> 01:46:15.245
You heard me, bitch! Up on the ledge!

01:46:31.595 --> 01:46:33.430
The look on your face.

01:46:35.724 --> 01:46:37.309
You're so proud.

01:46:38.018 --> 01:46:40.020
Darius Kincaid,

01:46:40.937 --> 01:46:43.648
about to be a hero, save the day.

01:46:44.649 --> 01:46:46.151
None of that matters.

01:46:47.152 --> 01:46:48.361
There is no redemption,

01:46:48.820 --> 01:46:51.865
no atonement for a man like you.

01:46:51.948 --> 01:46:56.578
Your whole life has been
but a trail of corpses,

01:46:57.913 --> 01:47:01.041
and I will be just another
dead body on the pile!

01:47:03.460 --> 01:47:04.460
Go ahead!

01:47:06.046 --> 01:47:07.046
Finish me!

01:47:09.007 --> 01:47:13.428
But don't think for a moment
it will change what you are.

01:47:20.936 --> 01:47:23.021
I don't give a fuck about all of that!

01:47:23.939 --> 01:47:24.939
You fucked up

01:47:25.899 --> 01:47:29.110
when you shot my bodyguard.

01:47:30.612 --> 01:47:31.612
Who?

01:47:45.377 --> 01:47:46.461
Dukhovich.

01:47:48.463 --> 01:47:49.463
That's Dukhovich.

01:48:14.531 --> 01:48:16.700
Okay, here's what I'm thinking.

01:48:17.701 --> 01:48:18.743
Celebrity security.

01:48:19.411 --> 01:48:20.411
It's low stress.

01:48:20.954 --> 01:48:22.914
Boy bands and shit, right?

01:48:22.998 --> 01:48:25.638
One of those guys gets killed,
nobody's getting all that mad at me.

01:48:27.168 --> 01:48:28.712
Well, we'll figure it out.

01:48:28.795 --> 01:48:29.795
We will?

01:48:31.256 --> 01:48:34.843
Yo! What a brother gotta do
to get arrested up in this bitch?

01:48:37.387 --> 01:48:40.807
Can't someone just Taser him?
I mean, like, a non-lethal Taser.

01:48:41.182 --> 01:48:44.811
Director Casoria. My deal still good?

01:48:45.395 --> 01:48:47.897
You definitely held up
your end, Mr. Kincaid.

01:48:48.565 --> 01:48:52.819
Agent Roussel, why don't you go find
Mr. Kincaid some handcuffs.

01:48:54.029 --> 01:48:55.030
With pleasure.

01:48:59.409 --> 01:49:01.661
You were right to trust your instincts.
Well done.

01:49:02.746 --> 01:49:03.746
Thank you, ma'am.

01:49:06.374 --> 01:49:07.917
- You're welcome.
- For what?

01:49:08.460 --> 01:49:10.587
I got you a front row seat
to the Roussel show,

01:49:10.670 --> 01:49:13.048
and I got you that all-access
backstage pass

01:49:13.131 --> 01:49:15.383
- to that ass you've been wanting so bad.
- You did what?

01:49:15.759 --> 01:49:18.094
You jumped out of the car,
I gave her the 411 on you.

01:49:18.178 --> 01:49:21.097
I didn't jump out of the...
I went through the fucking windshield.

01:49:21.181 --> 01:49:22.015
Semantics.
