02:59.682 --> 03:01.838
Slowly does it,
Mr. Evans!

03:02.470 --> 03:03.462
When I give
the word!

03:03.505 --> 03:05.565
Now, are you
ready with your cork, sir?

03:05.816 --> 03:07.786
A great
big smile! Beautiful!

03:08.337 --> 03:09.429
Ready?

03:09.580 --> 03:11.240
Oh, dear,
oh dear, oh...

03:11.491 --> 03:13.737
oh, oh, oh...
this is awful.

03:19.085 --> 03:21.071
Oh, David, take us with you.

03:21.163 --> 03:23.336
Sorry, Maisie.
No passengers allowed.

03:23.383 --> 03:25.084
Tell you what, Innes.
I'll bet you 50 guineas

03:25.235 --> 03:27.012
my coach and four'll
beat you to the other side.

03:27.262 --> 03:29.240
Good idea! While
you're galloping over the top

03:29.391 --> 03:31.227
we'll be drilling
through the middle.

03:31.644 --> 03:33.939
That'll do.
Stop there.

03:35.550 --> 03:36.874
Thank you.

03:37.104 --> 03:37.934
Doc?

03:38.204 --> 03:40.101
Oh, David, my dear fellow,

03:40.232 --> 03:41.979
what a proud moment this is.

03:42.014 --> 03:44.839
I hope your faith
in me will be fully justified.

03:44.913 --> 03:46.135
I just made a wager.

03:46.164 --> 03:47.366
A little champagne to success?

03:47.517 --> 03:49.420
Oh, yes,
I'll... I'll drink to that.

03:50.096 --> 03:51.840
Oh, no.
I'd better not.

03:52.090 --> 03:52.882
I'm at the controls

03:53.133 --> 03:55.094
and you must keep
a clear head, too, David.

03:55.720 --> 03:57.180
- Winterbottom...
- Mr. Innes, sir.

03:57.831 --> 03:59.434
Dowsett, of the times.

03:59.684 --> 04:00.877
- How do you do, sir?
- How do you do?

04:00.928 --> 04:02.104
This is Dr. Abner Perry.

04:02.354 --> 04:03.648
- How do you do?
- How do you do, sir?

04:03.898 --> 04:05.083
Dr. Perry
was kind enough

04:05.133 --> 04:06.819
to nominate me
as his worst student.

04:07.069 --> 04:09.789
It took me longer to graduate
from geological engineering

04:09.915 --> 04:10.925
than any other man alive.

04:11.075 --> 04:13.036
Oh, but you had many
fine qualities, David.

04:13.579 --> 04:14.955
But you were rather slow.

04:15.205 --> 04:18.298
And that is rather surprising
because his father was so clever.

04:18.711 --> 04:22.261
One of the best we ever had in,
uh, '58, I think it was.

04:22.317 --> 04:23.760
Yes, yes, '58.

04:23.910 --> 04:24.927
Dear old dad.

04:25.079 --> 04:26.881
He should've
been here to see the mole.

04:26.931 --> 04:28.492
Ah, that is what you call it?

04:28.542 --> 04:30.186
The... the "iron mole"?

04:30.236 --> 04:31.354
That's what I call it.

04:31.604 --> 04:34.275
Dr. Perry here, calls it a high
calibration digging machine.

04:34.608 --> 04:38.935
It'll bore through solid rock
at a rate of 78 feet per minute.

04:38.989 --> 04:40.850
And this is
your design, Dr. Perry?

04:40.901 --> 04:43.394
The finance has been provided
by Mr. Innes, I gather.

04:43.473 --> 04:44.886
Oh, pardon me.

04:45.007 --> 04:47.213
David, gyroscopes.

04:47.251 --> 04:50.122
I know that today is just a
test-run through our Welsh hills...

04:50.189 --> 04:52.016
- Good day. David, come along.
- Good day, sir.

04:52.100 --> 04:55.178
But can you tell me, is it really
your intention to eventually explore

04:55.196 --> 04:56.974
deep into the bowels of the earth?

04:57.224 --> 04:59.602
Sir, we've been on top
of the earth long enough.

04:59.852 --> 05:02.950
It's about time
we found out what's underneath.

05:14.715 --> 05:16.209
Great crowd, huh, doc?

05:16.459 --> 05:18.879
Concentrate, David.
Close doors.

05:22.444 --> 05:23.608
Locks on.

05:24.671 --> 05:25.779
All secure.

05:25.940 --> 05:27.023
Ahh!

05:27.058 --> 05:29.340
How are we?
Ready to go, doc?

05:29.644 --> 05:31.005
Oh, yes!
Yes, my dear fellow.

05:31.081 --> 05:33.652
I'll just check the gyroscopes.

05:37.365 --> 05:38.452
Ahh!

05:38.699 --> 05:40.088
Very nice.

05:41.202 --> 05:43.873
Well, would you like
to move off, my boy?

05:44.332 --> 05:45.442
Ready and willing, doc.

05:45.492 --> 05:48.028
Good luck,
and happy landings.

05:49.365 --> 05:50.175
Oh, dear.

05:50.249 --> 05:52.176
Where is that smoke coming from?

05:53.219 --> 05:56.097
Ah, yes. Well, you'd better
put that out until we're underway.

05:57.284 --> 05:58.635
Procedure check.

06:01.274 --> 06:02.641
Vision ports.

06:03.577 --> 06:05.029
Opening vision ports.

06:13.432 --> 06:15.042
Control.

06:15.101 --> 06:16.178
Begin lift,

06:16.628 --> 06:18.521
steady up to 10 degrees.

06:19.507 --> 06:21.999
Check the inclinometer as we go, David.

06:26.141 --> 06:29.380
Milford, get the horses ready,
otherwise I shall lose 50 guineas.

06:29.388 --> 06:30.439
No cheating, Archie.

06:30.690 --> 06:32.651
You can't start until they're off.

06:37.433 --> 06:38.576
14,

06:39.326 --> 06:42.212
- 15...
- Right. Hold at that and lock off.

06:42.347 --> 06:44.383
- Locked off.
- Thank you, control.

06:44.993 --> 06:47.547
Vision lights, aft.

06:48.723 --> 06:51.093
Vision lights, forward.

06:51.937 --> 06:53.232
Nose-cutters.

06:58.379 --> 06:59.432
Right!

06:59.497 --> 07:01.063
Bring in the crawler banks.

07:06.999 --> 07:09.289
Firing engines, now.

07:14.043 --> 07:15.195
Here we go.

07:15.211 --> 07:18.449
10, 9, 8, 7...

07:19.877 --> 07:21.980
...4, 3,

07:22.446 --> 07:24.515
2, 1.

07:24.683 --> 07:25.710
Release.

07:31.092 --> 07:33.250
Up a little on the throttles, David.

07:33.462 --> 07:35.573
I have her at 1800.

07:38.619 --> 07:40.522
Oh! Back up, David!

07:43.785 --> 07:45.086
Going in again.

07:50.987 --> 07:52.063
Gripping now.

07:52.147 --> 07:53.581
Cut in the tail pan.

07:53.632 --> 07:54.975
Tail pan at 300.

07:55.226 --> 07:56.737
Come on, girls. Off we go.

07:56.787 --> 07:58.897
Come on, Milford.

07:59.649 --> 08:01.442
Steady the throttles.

08:02.545 --> 08:03.816
We're in.

08:08.277 --> 08:09.413
Slow her down, David.

08:09.863 --> 08:12.082
On the throttles.
Don't cut the engines.

08:14.937 --> 08:15.671
Whew!

08:15.921 --> 08:17.607
By gad!
That cannot be possible.

08:17.757 --> 08:19.805
Quick. What does
the distance meter read?

08:20.436 --> 08:22.097
Confounded contraption!

08:22.347 --> 08:24.399
It should be 700 feet deep

08:24.550 --> 08:26.469
by the time we get
it back to horizontal.

08:30.233 --> 08:31.944
She's going too fast.

08:34.948 --> 08:37.946
I can't change her course,
most extraordinary thing!

08:40.523 --> 08:42.751
The mole is burning up inside, doc.

08:46.590 --> 08:49.687
Can you... can you just
take over, David?

08:49.762 --> 08:52.007
I must...

08:52.557 --> 08:54.977
- Don't give up, sir
- I can't, I...

08:55.686 --> 08:57.970
- Ah, oh, ah...
- Doc! Doc Perry!

08:59.542 --> 09:00.635
- Ohh!
- Don't...

09:49.897 --> 09:51.489
Perry!
Doc?

09:55.455 --> 09:56.675
- Oh, Doc!
- Huh?

09:58.567 --> 09:59.527
- Doc!
- Oh!

09:59.877 --> 10:01.905
- You all right?
- Where wh-where was I?

10:04.334 --> 10:06.411
It's c-c-c-old.

10:07.221 --> 10:09.291
- The temperature...
- Hmmm?

10:09.375 --> 10:10.489
Look at it.

10:11.369 --> 10:12.837
I can't see a thing.

10:12.888 --> 10:13.783
Oh!

10:14.423 --> 10:15.165
Ice.

10:15.757 --> 10:17.346
Ice. It can't be possible.

10:18.344 --> 10:21.156
Fascinating. Just
make a note of the...

10:21.192 --> 10:21.900
Oh!

10:21.950 --> 10:24.771
Just make a note of
the temperature, will you?

10:27.266 --> 10:28.852
She's going up!

10:30.028 --> 10:31.864
A little more throttle, David.

10:40.985 --> 10:42.212
Temperature's rising, doc.

10:42.362 --> 10:43.714
We're on our way home.

10:45.042 --> 10:45.842
Not quite.

10:46.092 --> 10:47.804
We appear to be, uh,
in the middle

10:48.054 --> 10:50.599
of a... an underground
lake at the moment.

10:54.564 --> 10:55.289
Ohh!

10:55.340 --> 10:56.245
Excellent!

10:56.457 --> 10:57.411
Excellent!

10:57.692 --> 10:59.787
Lifting nicely.
Knew she'd do it.

10:59.821 --> 11:00.988
Lifting nicely?

11:07.365 --> 11:08.799
Hold on, doc!

11:15.243 --> 11:16.279
Hold on.

11:22.419 --> 11:23.938
Ohh!

11:38.625 --> 11:40.753
Total power failure?

11:41.004 --> 11:42.882
Oh, how very disappointing.

11:43.132 --> 11:44.341
It must've been the water.

11:44.592 --> 11:47.137
I didn't allow
for that contingency.

11:47.372 --> 11:50.488
Well, doc, shall we
see where we are?

11:50.677 --> 11:51.469
Yes.

11:52.513 --> 11:55.144
I'll, uh, just
get my umbrella.

11:55.179 --> 11:57.579
The weather seems so changeable.

11:59.524 --> 12:01.067
Ah!

12:01.318 --> 12:03.823
Ah, where did I put it
amongst all this lot?

12:04.448 --> 12:05.908
Ah! There it is.

12:27.483 --> 12:28.736
Doc?

12:29.653 --> 12:30.530
Doc!

12:30.780 --> 12:33.380
Yes... yes. What?

12:33.415 --> 12:34.366
Come here, quick.

12:34.401 --> 12:39.296
Hey really, I really must check
the reason for that power failure.

12:39.326 --> 12:41.306
I don't like being...

12:44.969 --> 12:48.470
what an unbelievable sight.

12:50.186 --> 12:51.214
Oop!

12:51.249 --> 12:52.548
Steady, doc.

12:53.682 --> 12:54.724
David!

12:54.901 --> 12:58.731
This can't be the other
side of the hill, surely.

12:58.790 --> 13:02.400
Unless it's
changed dramatically.

13:06.711 --> 13:08.400
Well, where are we?

13:08.923 --> 13:12.099
Look at this Mesozoic moss.

13:12.136 --> 13:14.355
Or is it a cycad?

13:14.598 --> 13:16.582
Yeah, I'm not sure, I...

13:16.617 --> 13:19.370
I've only seen it
before in fossilized form.

13:19.405 --> 13:22.130
I would dearly love to take
a frond back with me.

13:22.134 --> 13:24.022
That will be great, doc.
Just great.

13:24.057 --> 13:25.842
But where on earth can we be?

13:27.953 --> 13:28.703
Doc?

13:28.954 --> 13:30.187
Oh, I say.

13:30.222 --> 13:32.634
Steady, they may be stingers.

13:32.669 --> 13:34.086
Onward, dear boy.

13:40.012 --> 13:43.328
What an extraordinary sky.

13:44.102 --> 13:46.884
What a strange color, doc.

13:46.919 --> 13:49.234
This cannot be the Rhondda valley.

13:50.361 --> 13:53.314
I've never seen anything like it.

13:53.349 --> 13:55.066
Like nothing on earth.

14:03.506 --> 14:04.901
David?

14:05.551 --> 14:07.811
We are not on earth.

14:07.846 --> 14:08.564
We're...

14:08.714 --> 14:11.711
Well, if we're not on earth, doc,
then where the hell are we?

14:11.746 --> 14:17.552
From my observations, dear friend, I
can positively state that we are under it.

14:17.904 --> 14:18.628
Under?

14:18.655 --> 14:21.098
At the earth's core.

14:28.002 --> 14:30.279
By Jove!

14:30.314 --> 14:32.974
How very interesting.

14:34.721 --> 14:36.639
- Uh, d-doc...
- Mmm?

14:36.657 --> 14:39.749
No, I-I don't think you
want to get too close to that.

14:43.693 --> 14:44.763
Yes.

14:44.798 --> 14:48.653
It is a somewhat aggressive
looking... creature.

15:03.583 --> 15:04.766
David!

15:05.519 --> 15:06.800
Oh, dear!

15:08.691 --> 15:11.535
David, don't lose contact.

15:11.571 --> 15:12.720
Doc!

15:16.954 --> 15:18.748
Shoo! Shoo!

15:21.627 --> 15:22.962
Oh!

15:29.431 --> 15:30.725
Oh!

15:36.400 --> 15:38.293
Oh, oh dear!

15:40.156 --> 15:41.450
Oh!

15:44.537 --> 15:46.587
- Ohh!
- No, doc. This way.

15:46.875 --> 15:48.536
Oh, dear.
Oh!

15:50.330 --> 15:52.099
- Here.
- Oh, dear.

15:52.892 --> 15:55.445
Take care of
yourself, David.

15:55.597 --> 15:57.298
- Oh!
- Hang on, doc.

16:19.509 --> 16:20.969
David?

16:21.737 --> 16:23.503
Hang on, doc.

16:26.319 --> 16:27.224
Oh!

16:31.151 --> 16:32.403
Ugh!

16:38.846 --> 16:39.839
Take that!

16:52.768 --> 16:53.936
Come on!

16:56.174 --> 16:57.610
You ugly...

17:49.814 --> 17:51.246
Oh, dear.

17:51.401 --> 17:54.021
Oh, oh, I say!

17:56.491 --> 17:58.897
I say, do be careful.

18:17.566 --> 18:20.443
But we came in peace!

18:27.915 --> 18:29.168
Ugh!

18:32.714 --> 18:34.651
Oh, oh, David,

18:34.686 --> 18:36.953
How good to see that you're safe.

18:38.630 --> 18:40.400
Have you ever seen
anything like this before?

18:40.401 --> 18:41.066
No.

18:41.067 --> 18:42.828
Those prisoners look human.

18:42.863 --> 18:43.567
Yes.

18:43.568 --> 18:46.490
And they appear to be intellectually
superior to our captors.

18:46.569 --> 18:48.065
I do find
that interesting.

18:48.395 --> 18:51.752
They seem a pretty subhuman
species, yet the master race.

18:51.942 --> 18:52.902
Isn't that always the way?

18:53.152 --> 18:55.177
Yes, the power
of aggression, dear boy.

18:55.572 --> 18:57.033
Brawn before brains.

18:57.283 --> 18:58.826
No! Don't hit him!

18:58.861 --> 19:01.082
I'll remember him, doc,
but they all look the same.

19:01.181 --> 19:01.916
Yes.

19:44.598 --> 19:46.182
Ugh!

20:01.864 --> 20:02.665
David,

20:02.915 --> 20:04.545
don't you think it's about time

20:04.548 --> 20:07.382
we introduced ourselves
to our fellow sufferers?

20:08.131 --> 20:11.175
Dr. Abner Perry
at your service, ma'am.

20:12.769 --> 20:14.563
David.

20:14.813 --> 20:15.530
Dia.

20:15.531 --> 20:17.568
Dia?

20:18.819 --> 20:20.440
You can call him Doc.

20:21.991 --> 20:24.374
- Ghak.
- Oh, Ghak.

20:28.008 --> 20:28.933
Oh!

20:29.086 --> 20:30.170
Dia?

20:30.620 --> 20:33.359
Who's that man up in front
who keeps looking at me?

20:33.592 --> 20:36.123
He is Hoojah the sly one.

20:36.158 --> 20:37.334
Do not trust him.

21:11.651 --> 21:12.862
Perry?

21:15.657 --> 21:17.984
Doesn't it ever
get dark here?

21:18.411 --> 21:21.331
According to my watch, we've
been traveling for 2 days.

21:21.392 --> 21:23.585
No, here there can be no night.

21:23.620 --> 21:25.577
Just perpetual daylight.

21:25.714 --> 21:28.465
We are in a cave, you understand,

21:28.469 --> 21:30.243
a gigantic cave.

21:30.278 --> 21:33.115
And the sky is the underside
of the earth's crust...

21:33.226 --> 21:37.579
the magma, probably something
like 20 miles above us.

21:38.443 --> 21:39.819
Oh.

21:45.053 --> 21:48.768
Conserve your energy, dear boy.
We're both going to need it.

21:48.858 --> 21:50.425
That was my father's watch.

21:50.460 --> 21:51.935
Unpleasant character.

21:52.214 --> 21:54.258
Oh, dear!

21:55.051 --> 21:57.138
Dia?

21:57.514 --> 21:58.941
Who are they?

22:01.729 --> 22:02.854
Sagoths,

22:02.889 --> 22:04.633
soldiers of the Mahars.

22:04.668 --> 22:08.047
Oh, and... and pardon me,
what are Mahars?

22:08.407 --> 22:10.425
Mahars rule Pellucidar,

22:10.460 --> 22:13.664
and Sagoths take us
to be slaves in their city.

22:13.699 --> 22:15.324
- What a charming prospect.
- Dia.

22:17.837 --> 22:19.716
Aghh!

22:20.383 --> 22:21.969
Agh!

22:40.730 --> 22:41.846
Dia!

22:44.421 --> 22:47.540
Your act of chivalry didn't
seem very popular, David.

22:58.232 --> 23:00.277
Ahhh!

24:47.903 --> 24:49.083
Pardon me.

24:50.782 --> 24:52.827
Doc!

25:04.871 --> 25:05.621
David!

25:05.771 --> 25:08.100
That must be the city of the Mahars.

25:13.943 --> 25:16.125
Oh! Do watch that thing!

25:16.406 --> 25:18.116
Ohh!

25:18.701 --> 25:20.287
Uhh!

25:21.246 --> 25:24.327
Oh, they're so excitable,
like all foreigners.

25:24.567 --> 25:25.294
Dia.

25:25.544 --> 25:27.465
Dia!

25:27.716 --> 25:30.191
I just wanted to ask
her how much farther.

25:30.469 --> 25:33.101
They're giving
us the cold shoulder, David.

25:33.136 --> 25:35.979
We certainly seem to have blotted
our copybook somehow.

25:36.394 --> 25:38.147
Ohh!

25:47.286 --> 25:49.164
Ugh!

26:01.517 --> 26:02.788
David, I-I...

26:02.823 --> 26:04.696
I'm sorry to
be a burden, but I...

26:04.731 --> 26:06.874
I don't think
I can go on much longer.

26:06.909 --> 26:08.810
Come on, doc.
It can't be much farther.

26:19.460 --> 26:21.048
Oh!

26:50.176 --> 26:52.672
Noisy lot, aren't they, David?

26:56.436 --> 26:58.188
Ah.

27:08.371 --> 27:09.372
Doc?

27:09.423 --> 27:10.373
Mmm?

27:10.625 --> 27:12.167
Dia...

27:12.417 --> 27:13.554
Dia, she's gone.

27:13.589 --> 27:15.015
Uh?
She's not here?

27:15.050 --> 27:18.286
Ghak, what happened to Dia?

27:20.722 --> 27:22.416
Hoojah the sly one.

27:22.934 --> 27:25.875
He escaped with the girl you refused.

27:25.910 --> 27:28.107
- I what?
- You insulted Dia.

27:28.142 --> 27:30.326
Do you not know what you have done?

27:30.763 --> 27:31.555
No.

27:32.205 --> 27:35.211
When a man from Pellucidar fights
with another man for a woman,

27:35.236 --> 27:37.690
she belongs to he who wins.

27:38.887 --> 27:41.346
Well, you should've claimed
her or released her.

27:41.351 --> 27:44.119
But you showed contempt
for her by doing nothing.

27:45.823 --> 27:48.410
Now no man can
take her as mate

27:49.452 --> 27:51.906
until he's overcome you in combat.

27:55.668 --> 27:56.564
I didn't know.

27:56.599 --> 27:59.254
I thought I was protecting her.

28:00.208 --> 28:04.132
Forgive me, for you
could not have known.

28:06.858 --> 28:10.118
Dia was in hiding from Jubal,

28:11.264 --> 28:13.023
the ugly one.

28:14.568 --> 28:17.618
He is a man with the
strength of many men.

28:18.738 --> 28:22.782
And he has made it known
that he wants Dia for his mate.

28:24.438 --> 28:26.743
There is no one who can
defend her against him,

28:27.084 --> 28:29.582
and so Dia fled to the hills.

28:30.671 --> 28:33.782
Only to be captured
by a Sagoth raiding party.

28:38.848 --> 28:41.852
There is something
you should know, my friend.

28:42.845 --> 28:48.285
Dia is a princess,
the daughter of kings.

28:50.422 --> 28:54.147
She is proud and she
will never forgive you,

28:54.208 --> 28:57.465
even if you did find her again,
which you will not.

28:58.999 --> 29:04.152
We are all doomed
to slavery... and death.

29:16.753 --> 29:19.878
They are no respecters of age, are they?

29:31.039 --> 29:32.141
David!

29:32.176 --> 29:34.316
What a phenomenal sight...

29:34.794 --> 29:36.842
a fire curtain!

29:37.714 --> 29:39.758
Ooh!

30:34.577 --> 30:36.873
Ugh!

31:08.411 --> 31:09.758
- David!
- What?

31:09.793 --> 31:13.775
A Rhamphorhynchus of
the middle Jurassic period.

31:26.733 --> 31:28.996
My goodness, how enormous.

31:29.031 --> 31:31.800
Why, the largest
remains we ever discovered

31:31.835 --> 31:36.378
have never indicated a size much greater
than that attained by an ordinary crow.

33:07.061 --> 33:08.686
- Oh!
- Hey!

33:08.721 --> 33:09.874
What are you doing?

33:09.909 --> 33:10.940
Oh, oh!

33:11.090 --> 33:12.022
Doc!

33:39.394 --> 33:41.158
Perry!
Take care of yourself.

33:41.179 --> 33:42.405
I will, and you.

33:42.864 --> 33:45.008
You are beginning to annoy me.

34:25.369 --> 34:29.422
Ghak, one at a time.
You've got a long day.

34:38.101 --> 34:40.098
Ah, there you are, my friend.

34:40.132 --> 34:42.596
Another one for the shelves.

34:43.183 --> 34:44.621
Thank you.

34:46.168 --> 34:47.638
Now, what have we got?

34:51.943 --> 34:53.543
Fascinating.

34:54.739 --> 34:56.574
"The Mahar...

34:56.824 --> 34:58.368
"is limited...

34:58.618 --> 35:00.580
"vocally...

35:02.998 --> 35:05.042
"but has been...

35:06.504 --> 35:08.382
"endowed...

35:08.632 --> 35:09.465
"with...

35:09.715 --> 35:11.251
"mesmeric powers...

35:11.801 --> 35:14.392
"and a high degree of telepathy".

35:15.431 --> 35:18.885
That's quite a
combination, for a bird.

35:26.053 --> 35:28.976
I don't know what it is
they're giving us to eat.

35:29.156 --> 35:31.624
Perhaps it's just as well.

35:34.079 --> 35:35.846
- Doc?
- Mm-hmm?

35:36.990 --> 35:38.981
How do we get out of here?

35:39.569 --> 35:42.905
I really haven't been able
to find out anything definite

35:42.937 --> 35:44.520
about the Mahar's secret yet,

35:44.555 --> 35:49.940
except that, in some way,
it is connected with the lava,

35:49.941 --> 35:51.561
with the heat.

35:51.996 --> 35:53.960
Well, I'm certainly getting
to know about that.

35:53.964 --> 35:55.875
Ahh, but that is the point, David.

35:55.910 --> 36:00.560
Slaves are used to constantly
repair and divert the lava channels.

36:00.587 --> 36:03.500
You see, although the
lava is of vital importance,

36:03.516 --> 36:07.500
it is also eating away at the very
foundations of the Mahar city.

36:07.512 --> 36:11.891
And so its flow has to be continually
checked and rechanneled.

36:11.927 --> 36:16.085
In fact, the whole safety of the
city is dependent upon the slaves.

36:16.349 --> 36:18.533
And, uh, we are
among their number now.

36:19.618 --> 36:21.729
Oh, there's
cheerful Annie again.

36:21.764 --> 36:22.884
Watch yourself, doc.

36:25.583 --> 36:26.576
Doc!

42:34.087 --> 42:35.010
Yeah.

43:06.435 --> 43:07.408
David.

43:08.639 --> 43:09.522
David.

43:10.016 --> 43:11.349
- Ra.
- Ra?

43:12.017 --> 43:13.351
Hu-rah, rah.

43:19.232 --> 43:20.775
Oh, uh...

43:21.811 --> 43:23.556
I don't come from Pellucidar.

43:24.279 --> 43:26.194
I come from another world.

43:30.118 --> 43:32.936
I escaped from the Mahar city.

43:33.272 --> 43:35.773
No one can escape from the Mahar city.

43:36.791 --> 43:39.466
The Mahars are all-seeing,

43:39.921 --> 43:42.047
all lethal.

43:42.714 --> 43:46.257
Ra, why haven't you risen up
and fought the Mahars?

43:46.292 --> 43:48.128
You do not know the Mahar.

43:48.303 --> 43:51.442
You have not really seen their power.

43:52.724 --> 43:53.976
They're evil!

43:57.222 --> 43:58.148
Ra,

43:58.198 --> 44:01.150
if your tribe and the others

44:01.401 --> 44:04.803
joined together, you could
defeat the Mahars.

44:05.030 --> 44:06.904
It's good thought.

44:08.074 --> 44:09.617
But come with me.

44:10.202 --> 44:11.702
I'll show you.

44:12.328 --> 44:14.248
Then you'll understand.

44:24.298 --> 44:25.884
Ra?

44:26.176 --> 44:28.135
Where are you taking me?

44:37.895 --> 44:41.054
We are now within the outer
walls of the Mahar grotto.

44:41.241 --> 44:43.276
We climb.

45:53.972 --> 45:56.100
What are these
prisoners doing here?

45:56.225 --> 45:58.369
Wait, and you shall see.

45:59.020 --> 46:02.879
You may be thankful that you're not
on the same side of the wall as they.

46:04.106 --> 46:05.777
The Mahars.

46:14.910 --> 46:16.904
Are you looking for someone?

46:17.188 --> 46:18.704
Yes.

46:18.955 --> 46:20.542
Dia.

46:37.683 --> 46:39.572
Thank God she's not here.

47:44.333 --> 47:45.752
Vile cr...

48:25.499 --> 48:27.294
They've got to be destroyed.

48:31.883 --> 48:33.394
They've got to be.

48:33.429 --> 48:35.703
Come.
We go.

51:20.259 --> 51:22.429
David.

51:42.283 --> 51:43.594
I'm going back.

51:43.629 --> 51:45.770
After what you've just seen?

51:46.037 --> 51:48.354
Especially after what I've seen.

51:48.538 --> 51:50.582
They've got to be destroyed.

51:50.664 --> 51:53.878
David, you're one man...

51:54.712 --> 51:56.588
Strong, it's true.

51:59.050 --> 52:00.577
How can you win?

52:01.010 --> 52:03.222
I've got to find the
secret of the Mahars

52:03.386 --> 52:05.039
and destroy them.

52:08.600 --> 52:11.613
- I'll bring Ghak back.
- Ghak?

52:12.270 --> 52:14.507
He will not trust me.

52:14.763 --> 52:17.215
No tribe trusts each other.

52:20.445 --> 52:21.911
I know.

52:29.746 --> 52:32.624
You go back to your village, Ra,

52:33.167 --> 52:35.736
till the Sagoths come again.

52:40.583 --> 52:43.372
Do you think I'll let
you go back alone?

52:47.473 --> 52:53.380
- You're a friend, Ra.
- Yes, but foolish friend.

52:53.415 --> 52:56.072
The Mahars will
make a meal of us.

52:57.199 --> 52:59.430
We've just doubled our strength.

53:48.576 --> 53:50.786
It's...

55:38.520 --> 55:40.063
Danion!

55:40.314 --> 55:41.232
The ear.

55:41.882 --> 55:43.826
Get it behind the ear.

56:09.302 --> 56:10.844
The ear!

57:25.128 --> 57:26.796
Oh, no!

58:13.300 --> 58:14.827
You got him!

58:36.625 --> 58:37.921
Bravo!

58:40.020 --> 58:41.832
David, above you!

59:18.641 --> 59:19.901
Freedom!

59:25.266 --> 59:26.302
Freedom!

59:26.353 --> 59:28.423
Freedom! Freedom!

59:49.690 --> 59:51.275
Come on, doc.

59:59.153 --> 01:00:00.448
Get a tight hold, doc.

01:00:00.699 --> 01:00:03.164
I have a firm grip upon
your trousers, David.

01:00:03.167 --> 01:00:03.958
- David!
- What?

01:00:03.959 --> 01:00:06.446
I found it!
I found the Mahar secret!

01:00:06.481 --> 01:00:07.909
- Come with me.
- Not now, doc!

01:00:07.944 --> 01:00:09.686
But it's just through
this hidey-hole.

01:00:09.738 --> 01:00:11.145
Come on, me boy,
I'll show you.

01:00:34.097 --> 01:00:36.017
It's not far now, David.

01:00:36.266 --> 01:00:38.340
Be careful of the edge.

01:00:48.774 --> 01:00:52.333
It was the most amazing piece of luck.

01:00:52.368 --> 01:00:54.257
I practically stumbled on it.

01:00:54.292 --> 01:00:57.750
And after pondering over all
those heavy slabs in the library

01:00:57.797 --> 01:00:59.669
and learning very little from them,

01:00:59.704 --> 01:01:01.791
I got so dispirited.

01:01:01.867 --> 01:01:05.454
I kept thinking, "whatever will I
tell David when he gets back?"

01:01:05.479 --> 01:01:08.047
You knew I'd come
back for you, did you?

01:01:08.246 --> 01:01:09.866
Of course I did.

01:01:09.901 --> 01:01:11.551
What would I do without you?

01:01:16.543 --> 01:01:17.504
There...

01:01:17.755 --> 01:01:19.340
there it is.

01:01:19.589 --> 01:01:22.866
The very origin of
every Mahar that's born.

01:01:23.507 --> 01:01:24.843
Look, David.

01:01:25.093 --> 01:01:26.969
Do you see that winch?

01:01:27.219 --> 01:01:29.904
That is what controls the fire curtain.

01:01:37.351 --> 01:01:39.334
This is where we're
going to finish them.

01:02:06.781 --> 01:02:09.218
- It's a dead end, David.
- Doc, in here.

01:02:09.290 --> 01:02:11.490
Down there? But I'm
not a rabbit, you know.

01:02:11.525 --> 01:02:12.852
Come on, doc.

01:02:19.132 --> 01:02:22.379
Fascinating rock structure, David.

01:02:22.414 --> 01:02:24.718
Would you please, doc... come on!

01:02:25.711 --> 01:02:28.725
Oh, I'll just sit for a moment.

01:02:28.860 --> 01:02:30.483
Alright.
Catch your breath.

01:02:31.056 --> 01:02:32.902
I can't find my marks.

01:02:32.909 --> 01:02:36.938
David? Have you ever
thought of going to the moon?

01:02:37.812 --> 01:02:39.021
Hmm?

01:02:39.271 --> 01:02:40.516
Come on, doc.

01:02:40.551 --> 01:02:42.440
Oh, uh, which way now?

01:02:45.025 --> 01:02:47.252
I'm afraid we're lost, doc.

01:02:47.568 --> 01:02:50.503
Be careful not to graze
yourself on these

01:02:50.504 --> 01:02:53.953
formidable-looking rocks here.

01:02:54.074 --> 01:02:55.448
Oh!

01:02:55.699 --> 01:02:58.076
I say, there's that...

01:02:58.136 --> 01:03:00.578
peculiar pellucid light ahead.

01:03:00.829 --> 01:03:02.764
Shall we explore?

01:03:06.499 --> 01:03:07.875
Whoops-a-daisy.

01:03:08.126 --> 01:03:10.420
Here, doc. Come on.

01:03:10.670 --> 01:03:12.295
Watch yourself.

01:03:12.545 --> 01:03:14.881
Come on.

01:03:20.719 --> 01:03:22.596
Oh!

01:03:22.845 --> 01:03:24.762
Fresh air at last.

01:03:27.514 --> 01:03:28.349
David?

01:03:30.182 --> 01:03:31.977
I'm so sorry, dear fellow.

01:03:32.227 --> 01:03:35.065
This place is apt to make
one a little jumpy.

01:03:35.078 --> 01:03:36.813
Here, sit down.

01:03:50.157 --> 01:03:50.989
Dia!

01:03:51.239 --> 01:03:53.723
Come, and I kill her.

01:04:00.163 --> 01:04:00.956
Dia!

01:04:01.205 --> 01:04:03.054
Ahh! David!

01:04:50.491 --> 01:04:52.247
Bull's-eye!

01:04:56.247 --> 01:04:57.513
Dia?

01:04:57.563 --> 01:04:58.339
No.

01:04:58.688 --> 01:05:00.927
Dia, I thought
I'd never see you again.

01:05:01.375 --> 01:05:03.459
Dia?

01:05:05.586 --> 01:05:07.935
Be masterful, David.

01:05:08.420 --> 01:05:09.673
Dia?

01:05:09.923 --> 01:05:11.006
Sit down!

01:05:11.257 --> 01:05:12.508
Sit down!

01:05:13.058 --> 01:05:16.293
- Now, you listen to me...
- No, it's too late now.

01:05:17.563 --> 01:05:19.187
When we were near my village,

01:05:19.188 --> 01:05:21.541
I managed to escape
from Hoojah the sly one.

01:05:21.576 --> 01:05:23.688
And now I fear
that Hoojah the sly one

01:05:23.723 --> 01:05:25.542
will lead Jubal
the ugly one back here.

01:05:25.577 --> 01:05:26.800
I heard about him.

01:05:27.051 --> 01:05:28.677
David, he will kill you.

01:05:28.727 --> 01:05:31.112
He is the strongest warrior
in all of Pellucidar.

01:05:34.357 --> 01:05:36.276
What, David?

01:05:41.904 --> 01:05:44.619
The sooner I meet up
with Jubal, the better.

01:05:44.739 --> 01:05:46.156
Come on.

01:05:46.407 --> 01:05:47.399
Come on!

01:05:48.050 --> 01:05:50.418
- Watch your step, doc.
- Oh, yes.

01:05:50.576 --> 01:05:53.763
My word, what a fiery beastie.

01:05:56.123 --> 01:05:58.016
Oh, your royal highness,

01:05:58.165 --> 01:06:00.167
how very nice
to see you again.

01:06:00.417 --> 01:06:03.580
Remarkably efficient,
these primitive weapons.

01:06:03.587 --> 01:06:05.589
I've never had occasion
to use them before.

01:06:05.590 --> 01:06:08.220
Ha! The cord
from my spectacles.

01:06:08.723 --> 01:06:12.247
Oh, your tomahawk came
in very useful, too, David.

01:06:13.385 --> 01:06:16.032
Brains before brawn, huh, doc?

01:06:16.067 --> 01:06:18.205
Oh, a combination of both, dear boy.

01:06:18.707 --> 01:06:19.807
We must hurry.

01:06:19.942 --> 01:06:22.009
Yeah, I've got to find the ugly one.

01:06:22.684 --> 01:06:25.503
Wouldn't exactly call him
very pretty, would you?

01:06:26.102 --> 01:06:28.939
Hey, David!
Wait for me!

01:06:31.355 --> 01:06:33.939
It's Jubal the ugly one!

01:06:36.719 --> 01:06:37.930
You can say that again.

01:06:38.152 --> 01:06:39.029
Come, we must hide.

01:06:39.079 --> 01:06:41.740
- No, no, Dia, no!
- Come!

01:06:42.457 --> 01:06:44.888
I'm gonna have to fight
Jubal once and for all.

01:06:45.024 --> 01:06:48.120
- Stand aside, David.
- Doc, I said this is my fight.

01:07:47.370 --> 01:07:49.663
- Ohh!
- David!

01:07:50.704 --> 01:07:53.083
David...

01:08:05.281 --> 01:08:06.480
Watch him, David!

01:08:28.982 --> 01:08:30.430
That's right, David.

01:08:30.466 --> 01:08:31.987
Dia.

01:08:33.520 --> 01:08:34.871
No! No!

01:08:35.621 --> 01:08:37.384
Unhand her, you coward.

01:08:46.229 --> 01:08:48.694
Never mind the Queensberry rules.

01:09:21.438 --> 01:09:23.773
Well done, David!

01:09:27.066 --> 01:09:27.902
Now...

01:09:28.151 --> 01:09:29.819
you scoundrel.

01:09:34.448 --> 01:09:35.740
Missed.

01:09:35.990 --> 01:09:38.609
Well, at least we put
him to his heels. Hmph!

01:09:38.658 --> 01:09:40.051
Well done, David!

01:09:40.402 --> 01:09:42.265
Such courage, my boy!

01:09:42.300 --> 01:09:43.884
Such great courage!

01:09:44.496 --> 01:09:46.581
David!

01:09:50.375 --> 01:09:51.959
Jubal!

01:09:52.210 --> 01:09:53.859
You have defeated Jubal.

01:09:56.255 --> 01:09:57.656
Dia is yours.

01:09:58.757 --> 01:10:05.496
Dia will not be mine until we destroy
the Mahars and free Pellucidar.

01:10:20.523 --> 01:10:21.981
Raise bows.

01:10:24.067 --> 01:10:25.401
Take aim.

01:10:26.735 --> 01:10:27.945
Fire!

01:10:30.239 --> 01:10:33.258
Robin Hood and his
merry men, what, David?

01:10:42.556 --> 01:10:46.482
Hear me, leaders of
the tribes of Pellucidar.

01:10:47.559 --> 01:10:50.706
These strangers came to our world...

01:10:51.462 --> 01:10:56.616
a world ruled by the Mahars who
have enslaved and tortured us.

01:10:57.632 --> 01:11:02.038
For as long as we can recall...
our tribes have been divided.

01:11:03.037 --> 01:11:07.639
Now, with the help of
our new-found friends

01:11:08.532 --> 01:11:09.750
we are united.

01:11:09.800 --> 01:11:14.962
And we have the strength and the
power to destroy once and for all

01:11:14.969 --> 01:11:17.158
those who have enslaved us.

01:11:17.548 --> 01:11:20.139
Death to the Mahars!

01:11:38.487 --> 01:11:41.923
Well, David, would you like to
summarize our deployment?

01:11:44.542 --> 01:11:46.919
I will lead the main attack.

01:11:47.252 --> 01:11:49.867
Ghak, and his men will cover the rear.

01:11:50.571 --> 01:11:54.357
Ra and Dr. Perry will go ahead of us

01:11:54.925 --> 01:11:57.266
through the lava channel
and the inner sanctum

01:11:58.211 --> 01:12:00.947
and cut off the main fire supply.

01:12:01.263 --> 01:12:02.579
I hate to ask you
to do this, doc,

01:12:02.629 --> 01:12:04.698
but you know where
the controls are.

01:12:04.748 --> 01:12:07.767
I'm delighted to be of
some active service, my boy.

01:12:08.434 --> 01:12:11.609
Don't you worry, David.
I will take good care of him.

01:12:11.670 --> 01:12:12.815
Oh, most kind.

01:12:13.671 --> 01:12:17.182
Well, meeting adjourned, gentlemen.

01:12:19.700 --> 01:12:22.963
- I go with you, yes?
- No, Dia. No.

01:12:23.061 --> 01:12:24.196
Why not, David?

01:12:26.172 --> 01:12:29.557
Dia, the Mahar city is
no place for you.

01:12:32.786 --> 01:12:35.578
- David...
- Dia.

01:13:39.909 --> 01:13:42.160
This is it.

01:13:43.845 --> 01:13:46.728
I must warn you,
it gets very hot in there.

01:14:31.888 --> 01:14:33.572
Deuced it's hot!

01:14:48.925 --> 01:14:51.130
You could roast an ox in here.

01:15:13.502 --> 01:15:15.100
Got you, you bounder!

01:15:16.904 --> 01:15:19.392
Oh, I do beg your pardon,
your royal highness.

01:15:19.407 --> 01:15:21.595
I thought you were the enemy.

01:15:21.690 --> 01:15:24.199
- No.
- Dia, what are you doing here?

01:15:24.318 --> 01:15:26.986
It's Hoojah... he has
been captured by the Sagoths.

01:15:28.896 --> 01:15:29.990
He might betray us.

01:15:30.039 --> 01:15:31.820
That traitorous blighter!

01:15:31.823 --> 01:15:33.831
What a pity my arrow missed him.

01:15:34.082 --> 01:15:35.894
Oh, well.
Quickly, fall in.

01:15:36.044 --> 01:15:37.035
- Follow me.
- Right.

01:15:37.036 --> 01:15:39.796
Single file.

01:16:05.890 --> 01:16:07.035
Retreat!

01:16:13.570 --> 01:16:15.767
Ra, the inner sanctum!

01:20:40.055 --> 01:20:42.381
You cannot mesmerize me!

01:20:42.416 --> 01:20:45.177
I'm British!

01:21:14.906 --> 01:21:15.607
Dia!

01:21:16.040 --> 01:21:17.116
Dia! Perry!

01:21:33.412 --> 01:21:34.344
Dia!

01:22:38.307 --> 01:22:39.701
Dia!

01:22:42.376 --> 01:22:43.227
Doc!

01:23:00.098 --> 01:23:01.126
Dia!

01:23:37.726 --> 01:23:38.818
David!

01:23:51.027 --> 01:23:52.031
David!

01:24:01.410 --> 01:24:02.768
Ahh, David!

01:24:10.374 --> 01:24:12.334
David!

01:24:15.587 --> 01:24:16.916
Doc, you're limping!

01:24:16.951 --> 01:24:18.313
Oh, it's my brolly!

01:24:18.348 --> 01:24:20.465
Come on, doc, hurry up!

01:24:53.830 --> 01:24:55.037
Come on, doc!

01:24:55.072 --> 01:24:57.158
Here, David, here!

01:25:00.370 --> 01:25:01.536
Come on!

01:25:01.786 --> 01:25:03.788
Keep going, doc.

01:25:08.593 --> 01:25:09.474
Dia.

01:25:09.625 --> 01:25:11.919
Perry, this way.

01:25:23.010 --> 01:25:25.083
Wh-why have you stopped?

01:25:25.118 --> 01:25:27.245
- We must wait for Ra!
- Oh, yes!

01:25:28.431 --> 01:25:31.079
Ra!

01:25:31.114 --> 01:25:32.203
It's too late.

01:25:33.851 --> 01:25:35.437
Come on!

01:25:48.362 --> 01:25:49.946
Dia.

01:25:50.488 --> 01:25:52.031
Doc.

01:25:52.992 --> 01:25:54.449
Doc...

01:25:54.699 --> 01:25:56.285
Ra!

01:26:34.813 --> 01:26:36.022
Poor Ra.

01:26:36.272 --> 01:26:39.251
Yes, indeed.
A brave man.

01:26:48.948 --> 01:26:51.533
Come on, doc.

01:27:01.914 --> 01:27:04.316
Ah, here's David and his lovely lady.

01:27:05.377 --> 01:27:07.711
Goodbye!

01:27:10.756 --> 01:27:13.006
People of Pellucidar,

01:27:13.464 --> 01:27:16.176
according to your custom,

01:27:17.719 --> 01:27:20.586
I take Dia

01:27:22.347 --> 01:27:24.203
to be my bride.

01:27:30.519 --> 01:27:33.944
No, David.
It's not to be.

01:27:38.065 --> 01:27:41.479
I must stay here.
This is my world.

01:27:42.152 --> 01:27:44.872
I would be lost in yours.

01:27:44.988 --> 01:27:46.846
No. No, you wouldn't.

01:27:46.927 --> 01:27:48.801
I want to show you
the wonders of my world.

01:27:49.575 --> 01:27:53.261
I know, and I love you.

01:27:59.833 --> 01:28:03.330
Come along, David.
We must be on our way.

01:28:05.545 --> 01:28:07.756
Goodbye, Dia.

01:28:10.924 --> 01:28:13.300
God bless you.

01:29:09.424 --> 01:29:11.549
David?
