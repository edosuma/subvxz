01:45.397 --> 01:47.858
Scared the living crap out of me.

01:47.858 --> 01:49.860
Meryl Streep she wasn't.

01:49.860 --> 01:51.695
Who's Meryl Streep?

01:51.695 --> 01:54.823
Zoe, she's like Katie Holmes
to our parents.

01:54.823 --> 01:57.534
So, what's next, ladies?

01:57.534 --> 01:59.411
-I have to go home.
-No.

01:59.411 --> 02:03.415
I can't have another fight with
my parents. They think I'm in bed.

02:04.833 --> 02:06.710
Were you kids in bed early?

02:06.710 --> 02:10.172
-I stayed up till 10.
-After 9, Rhett was asleep.

02:10.172 --> 02:12.174
-Who's driving them?
-I will.

02:12.174 --> 02:16.178
Nicki's selling coffee at school,
I'm helping her.

02:17.179 --> 02:18.472
It sucks.

02:18.472 --> 02:22.476
Do not say "sucks," say "disappoints."

02:25.187 --> 02:27.898
I don't need a lunch.
I'll go with Tash.

02:27.898 --> 02:30.901
Eat pizza three days in a row?
I think not.

02:30.901 --> 02:33.320
That's really good.

02:33.320 --> 02:35.739
The proportions are perfect...

02:35.739 --> 02:38.909
...but do you draw
what you really see?

02:38.909 --> 02:42.913
The simplest is the hardest.
Seeing what's in front of you.

02:55.968 --> 02:57.928
What's on for tonight?

02:57.928 --> 03:01.932
I am so grounded. I got busted
sneaking back inside last night.

03:02.641 --> 03:06.645
-Damn, how'd you manage that?
-My dad set the motion detector.

03:06.770 --> 03:10.232
Our parents are getting
paranoid in their old age.

03:10.232 --> 03:14.236
Mine still trust me.

03:15.612 --> 03:19.616
It's beautiful.

03:19.658 --> 03:21.952
Not a bad couple of decades.

03:21.952 --> 03:24.830
Better than the first two
without you.

03:24.830 --> 03:28.834
To 20 years of you and me.

03:31.670 --> 03:35.674
And to our children, safe at home.

03:42.598 --> 03:44.391
Hey, cool, you lost them!

03:44.391 --> 03:47.519
Macho Mustang boys, to boot!

03:47.519 --> 03:51.523
-We struck a blow for sisterhood!
-The only "blow" you know.

03:51.565 --> 03:53.859
Diss.

03:53.859 --> 03:56.570
-Any raves?
-Full Moon Underground.

03:56.570 --> 03:59.573
San Bernardino.
Probably Saturday.

03:59.573 --> 04:02.034
I'll tell Mom I'm staying with you.

04:02.034 --> 04:05.454
I can't believe you
still work that scam.

04:05.454 --> 04:09.458
What can I say?
My 'rents are clueless.

04:10.584 --> 04:13.295
I'll bring glowsticks if you buy gas.

04:13.295 --> 04:17.048
-That's such a good idea!
-Nice try, Beams.

04:17.048 --> 04:19.593
Rest, it'll be one hell of a weekend.

04:19.593 --> 04:23.555
-Bye, Tasha.
-Don't let the bedbugs bite!

04:28.018 --> 04:32.022
Hasta!

04:47.037 --> 04:51.041
Now they call the cops on me.

04:58.757 --> 05:02.761
Hello!

05:05.639 --> 05:08.475
Hello!

05:08.475 --> 05:11.061
I'm sorry I'm late.

05:11.061 --> 05:14.898
Ruby Baker?

05:14.898 --> 05:18.902
Yeah, I'm Ruby.

05:19.486 --> 05:23.407
Whatever they said, I'm not missing.
I just went out.

05:24.992 --> 05:27.703
Your parents were in a car accident.

05:27.703 --> 05:30.539
Are they okay?

05:30.539 --> 05:34.501
-Ruby, why don't you have a seat, hon?
-Are they okay?

05:34.501 --> 05:38.088
My partner will help you have a seat.
Ruby.

05:38.088 --> 05:40.090
-I can sit down myself.
-I know.

05:40.090 --> 05:41.383
Are they okay?

05:41.383 --> 05:44.511
-Relax.
-We're here to help you.

05:44.511 --> 05:45.971
You'll be okay.

05:45.971 --> 05:49.975
Relax. Ruby?

05:52.853 --> 05:54.521
Ruby.

05:54.521 --> 05:55.814
You'll be okay.

05:55.814 --> 05:59.818
-Get her pulse.
-Can you hear me, Ruby?

06:03.697 --> 06:05.699
"They are as asleep.

06:05.699 --> 06:09.119
In the morning, they're like grass
which groweth up.

06:09.119 --> 06:12.414
In the morning, it flourisheth
and groweth up.

06:12.414 --> 06:16.168
In the evening, it is cut down
and withereth...

06:16.168 --> 06:20.172
...for we're consumed by thine anger
and by thy wrath we're troubled.

06:21.423 --> 06:25.427
Thou has set our iniquities
before thee, our secret sins...

06:25.552 --> 06:28.055
...in the light of thy countenance.

06:28.055 --> 06:31.934
For all our days are
passed away in thy wrath.

06:31.934 --> 06:34.937
We spend our years as
a tale that is told...

06:34.937 --> 06:37.898
...so teach us to number our days...

06:37.898 --> 06:41.902
...that we may apply
our hearts unto wisdom."

06:41.902 --> 06:45.864
I think Rhett Baker wants to
say something. Rhett?

07:03.090 --> 07:07.094
I just--

07:07.928 --> 07:11.890
I just wanna say....

07:19.523 --> 07:21.108
I just....

07:21.108 --> 07:25.112
It's okay.

07:29.074 --> 07:33.078
I didn't work with Dave and Grace
or see them every day...

07:33.245 --> 07:35.956
...but I knew them for 10 years...

07:35.956 --> 07:39.960
...and I'm sure if they
could hear this....

07:41.211 --> 07:43.130
Well, Grace...

07:43.130 --> 07:47.134
...would do her dismissive
little giggle.

07:47.217 --> 07:49.219
You know the one.

07:49.219 --> 07:53.223
And Dave would mutter
an "expletive deleted."

07:57.603 --> 08:00.689
They'd hate to be remembered
as anything but...

08:00.689 --> 08:04.151
...ordinary.

08:04.151 --> 08:07.696
Which is exactly what they were:

08:07.696 --> 08:11.700
Anything but ordinary.

08:12.034 --> 08:14.828
But they will live on...

08:14.828 --> 08:18.832
...through their children
and in all our hearts.

08:24.296 --> 08:27.049
Ruby?

08:27.049 --> 08:29.718
Do you remember me?

08:29.718 --> 08:32.638
I'm Uncle Jack,
your mom's brother.

08:32.638 --> 08:36.642
I'll go wait by the car, okay?

08:38.059 --> 08:41.647
If there's anything that you need...

08:41.647 --> 08:43.857
...anything I can do...

08:43.857 --> 08:47.861
...I don't mean in the next few weeks
or months, I mean anytime.

08:49.738 --> 08:53.742
How come I haven't seen you
in, like, 10 years?

08:54.034 --> 08:57.037
Have you even met my brother Rhett?

08:57.037 --> 08:59.331
Well, of course I have.

08:59.331 --> 09:02.042
I haven't seen either of you in years.

09:02.042 --> 09:05.963
First of all, I live pretty far away.
Chicago.

09:06.088 --> 09:08.882
Then how will you help us?

09:08.882 --> 09:12.803
I don't know.
There's the phone, e-mail.

09:12.803 --> 09:16.807
-You and my mom never wrote.
-That's true.

09:17.057 --> 09:20.352
As siblings get older,
they go separate ways.

09:20.352 --> 09:24.231
-You and Rhett are close now--
-We're not.

09:24.231 --> 09:27.901
We have nothing in common.

09:27.901 --> 09:31.822
Used to feel that way about your mom.
It's not true.

09:31.989 --> 09:35.993
I used to think I'd take a month off
and come out here...

09:36.660 --> 09:40.664
...and get to know you,
your brother and Grace again.

09:41.832 --> 09:45.836
Nice to see you.
Sorry things didn't work out.

09:53.677 --> 09:57.681
-I'll call you later, okay?
-Okay.

10:17.993 --> 10:21.705
Ruby? Hi.

10:21.705 --> 10:25.292
-I'm Alvin Begleiter.
-Hi.

10:25.292 --> 10:28.128
I'm so sorry.

10:28.128 --> 10:32.132
I'm your--
I was your parents' estate lawyer.

10:33.467 --> 10:35.886
I planned their wills...

10:35.886 --> 10:39.890
...what they wanted to do
with their money and--

10:41.642 --> 10:45.646
The most important issue right now
is who'll take care of you.

10:46.939 --> 10:48.357
You and Rhett.

10:48.357 --> 10:51.735
I'm assuming you know the Glasses?

10:51.735 --> 10:54.780
I've known them my whole life.

10:54.780 --> 10:57.282
Good. I know that your parents...

10:57.282 --> 11:01.286
...chose them after a great deal
of consideration.

11:01.286 --> 11:03.455
And there's something else.

11:03.455 --> 11:07.084
Your parents were extremely thrifty...

11:07.084 --> 11:11.088
...and with your mom's share,
your dad's life insurance...

11:13.799 --> 11:17.803
...there's enough for you
and Rhett for the rest of your lives.

11:19.054 --> 11:23.058
Obviously you don't know Rhett.

11:23.767 --> 11:27.271
That's good.
I'll give you one of my cards.

11:27.271 --> 11:29.815
I don't expect trouble.

11:29.815 --> 11:33.819
But if you have any concerns,
any problems....

11:34.903 --> 11:38.365
I'm an estate lawyer
and also a trust lawyer.

11:38.365 --> 11:42.369
I want to be someone you can trust.

11:47.833 --> 11:51.128
-You call me, okay?
-Okay.

11:51.128 --> 11:55.132
Mr. Glass.

11:57.134 --> 12:01.138
-Ruby.
-Thank you.

12:01.305 --> 12:05.309
My mom and dad would've
loved that speech.

12:06.310 --> 12:10.314
-They would've loved it.
-Come here.

12:12.149 --> 12:16.153
That's good.
We're gonna get through this.

12:17.029 --> 12:20.991
We'll get through it together, okay?

12:24.953 --> 12:27.247
Oh, Ruby.

12:27.247 --> 12:31.251
You're in good hands.

12:58.570 --> 13:00.781
Hey!

13:00.781 --> 13:04.785
-You guys ready for Malibu?
-It'll be a change, we won't lie.

13:05.786 --> 13:07.579
It's not the worst place.

13:07.579 --> 13:11.583
-Is this your car?
-My company's, on loan for today.

14:00.591 --> 14:04.595
Sweet!

14:04.928 --> 14:08.932
This place is huge!

14:11.268 --> 14:14.021
Hey, Rubes, check out this view.

14:14.021 --> 14:18.025
Yeah, it's pretty amazing.

14:21.987 --> 14:25.991
-Cool, a meteorite!
-It's art, Rhett.

14:26.950 --> 14:30.454
Give them the tour.
Stall them, I'll order dinner.

14:30.454 --> 14:34.458
Let's get the lay of the land.

14:38.128 --> 14:41.340
Master suite.

14:41.340 --> 14:45.052
Home gym.

14:45.052 --> 14:48.055
-Home theater.
-Sweet.

14:48.055 --> 14:52.059
-You never have to leave home.
-If only.

14:52.142 --> 14:54.353
Vicki comes in most days.

14:54.353 --> 14:56.271
-Hola, niÃ±os.
-Hola.

14:56.271 --> 15:00.150
Hello!

15:00.150 --> 15:03.946
This is your room.

15:03.946 --> 15:07.491
It's temporary quarters, of course.

15:07.491 --> 15:11.495
Unpack, get settled,
and I'll meet you in the kitchen.

15:15.499 --> 15:19.503
We're sharing a room?

15:22.381 --> 15:26.343
Glance at me when I'm changing
and you're busted.

15:27.052 --> 15:31.056
We have a little calamari,
a little risotto with mushrooms...

15:33.100 --> 15:37.104
...and green salad with
some Swiss chard.

15:43.235 --> 15:47.239
-Do you have any Garfield?
-What is that?

15:47.239 --> 15:51.243
-It's crap in a can.
-If it's crap, how come you eat it?

15:51.535 --> 15:55.539
-Come on, kids. Try the calamari.
-Isn't that squid?

16:02.087 --> 16:06.091
-Honey, tonight....
-I'll call Domino's.

16:06.550 --> 16:10.554
Thank you.

16:24.234 --> 16:27.738
Can you turn and face the wall?

16:27.738 --> 16:29.698
Who are you, the Blair Witch?

16:29.698 --> 16:33.577
I'm worse. Just face the wall.

16:33.577 --> 16:37.581
Turn that stupid thing off!

17:27.756 --> 17:30.801
There's public school,
then there's public school.

17:30.801 --> 17:34.638
Trust me, there won't be any
Bloods or Crips.

17:34.638 --> 17:37.349
I'm not scared of getting gunned down.

17:37.349 --> 17:41.228
-You're a great kid--
-It's not about being great.

17:41.228 --> 17:44.189
-It's about being....
-New?

17:44.189 --> 17:47.067
Middle-of-the-year new.

17:47.067 --> 17:51.071
There's a saying we teach
the Pain Ward patients.

17:51.280 --> 17:54.658
"This too shall pass."

17:54.658 --> 17:58.662
This too shall pass.
This too shall pass.

18:01.540 --> 18:02.791
Hi.

18:02.791 --> 18:06.795
Why don't you take
a seat in the back?

18:15.846 --> 18:18.432
We have a new addition.

18:18.432 --> 18:22.436
Would you introduce yourself,
Miss Baker?

18:23.562 --> 18:27.566
You just did.

18:31.570 --> 18:34.865
Hi.

18:34.865 --> 18:38.869
I'm Ruby Baker.

18:39.453 --> 18:43.457
I used to go to Shady Lane.
That's in the Valley.

18:44.708 --> 18:48.712
Not my choice,
just an accident of birth.

18:49.463 --> 18:52.466
How come you moved here?

18:52.466 --> 18:56.428
It was another accident.

18:57.596 --> 19:01.600
Let's make Ruby feel welcome.

19:15.739 --> 19:19.743
Thanks for the lift.

19:20.327 --> 19:24.331
Sweet!

19:26.208 --> 19:28.627
I can't believe it!

19:28.627 --> 19:31.630
Like one of those isn't noisy enough?

19:31.630 --> 19:35.634
No, Rubes. You can't play
"PokÃ©mon Snap" on PlayStation.

19:35.968 --> 19:39.805
You can play "Ape Escape,"
but not on N-64.

19:39.805 --> 19:43.809
Mom and Dad would freak out.

19:44.351 --> 19:48.355
Don't talk about them.

20:08.667 --> 20:11.962
I haven't seen one girl
with blue-black hair.

20:11.962 --> 20:15.966
The guys surf and swim all day.
That sun-worshiping culture.

20:16.800 --> 20:18.385
That sounds hot.

20:18.385 --> 20:22.389
I checked my pager all day.
I figured you'd call and you didn't.

20:23.390 --> 20:27.311
Cell phones are banned at school.
The kids don't care.

20:27.853 --> 20:30.814
They can't see they
lost their liberties.

20:30.814 --> 20:34.693
They have so much sunstroke,
they're wasted.

20:34.693 --> 20:38.697
Ruby?

20:40.324 --> 20:43.994
I got us an assortment
of different things.

20:43.994 --> 20:47.998
Some cold pastas, some salads.

20:52.419 --> 20:56.340
Ruby, I think that you'd be
well-served by a better attitude.

21:02.888 --> 21:06.892
It's okay. I don't mind take-out.
You're busy.

21:06.892 --> 21:08.727
It's not from Wendy's.

21:08.727 --> 21:12.731
I meant your attitude
toward your new school.

21:14.900 --> 21:18.904
-My attitude?
-I overheard your conversation.

21:20.030 --> 21:21.907
You were listening in?

21:21.907 --> 21:25.911
No, I was trying to get a line out,
but that's beside the point.

21:26.912 --> 21:30.499
The point is, you need those
kids to like you.

21:30.499 --> 21:33.627
Otherwise, you'll isolate,
sabotage yourself.

21:33.627 --> 21:37.631
-You'll have a miserable time.
-Okay, I get it.

21:43.512 --> 21:47.516
I learned something.

21:53.522 --> 21:55.524
Ruby?

21:55.524 --> 21:57.776
Ruby.

21:57.776 --> 22:01.780
-Wake up.
-I'm awake.

22:02.781 --> 22:06.785
-Wake up.
-Mommy?

22:08.495 --> 22:12.499
Mommy?

23:20.192 --> 23:23.445
You scared the crap out of me.

23:23.445 --> 23:27.449
I heard noises. I thought
it was a burglar or coyote.

23:27.574 --> 23:31.203
I'm not used to kids here.

23:31.203 --> 23:35.207
Come here.

23:39.044 --> 23:43.048
Thank you.

23:51.807 --> 23:54.601
You must be freezing.

23:54.601 --> 23:58.605
No more 3 a.m. swims. With all
the glass, you hear everything.

23:59.523 --> 24:02.943
I'll set the alarm at night.

24:02.943 --> 24:06.947
Are you coming?

24:13.203 --> 24:15.956
Drunk driving among teens has...

24:15.956 --> 24:19.251
...steadily decreased,
but we can do better.

24:19.251 --> 24:22.004
As these images starkly attest...

24:22.004 --> 24:26.008
...alcohol remains the No. 1
problem among teens.

24:26.842 --> 24:30.846
This year, 20 percent
of teenage drivers....

24:55.621 --> 24:59.625
How was your first day
of Driver's Ed?

24:59.875 --> 25:03.879
-Fine, I guess.
-They still show gruesome movies?

25:04.713 --> 25:06.715
Those were the Dark Ages.

25:06.715 --> 25:10.302
They have better ways
of teaching kids today.

25:10.302 --> 25:14.306
May I be excused?

25:22.856 --> 25:26.777
Stupid, kid-proof piece of crap.

25:28.612 --> 25:32.616
Ruby?

25:32.658 --> 25:36.662
Was it awful?
I mean, the driving class?

25:37.329 --> 25:41.333
-I can just imagine.
-No, it's....

25:44.253 --> 25:48.257
I have my period.

25:49.049 --> 25:53.053
Come with me.

26:04.189 --> 26:08.193
Thank you.

26:15.617 --> 26:18.787
Four doctors recommend....

26:18.787 --> 26:22.791
This cramp, too, shall pass.

26:25.252 --> 26:29.214
I'll turn it off
when I get to a save point.

26:30.382 --> 26:34.386
It's cool. I don't care.

26:35.262 --> 26:39.224
It's kind of relaxing.

27:02.289 --> 27:05.709
Erin, get out of there!

27:05.709 --> 27:09.129
What were you doing in there?
Tell me the truth!

27:09.129 --> 27:11.423
-What are you implying?
-Tell me!

27:11.423 --> 27:14.426
No, I won't answer you!
Good night!

27:14.426 --> 27:18.430
-What the hell are you doing?
-Getting ready for bed.

27:18.722 --> 27:22.726
-Watch your language.
-Don't play games with me.

27:22.851 --> 27:25.312
You know what I'm talking about.

27:25.312 --> 27:29.316
I'm too tired to guess.
I'm sick of your accusations.

27:29.483 --> 27:32.444
Is that what you call it now?

27:32.444 --> 27:34.655
-How many--
-I've done every--

27:34.655 --> 27:38.659
You told me you--

27:48.335 --> 27:49.962
Ruby?

27:49.962 --> 27:53.924
-Hi, I'm Hannah.
-Hi.

27:54.341 --> 27:58.262
There's this rumor you were
on academic probation.

27:59.179 --> 28:01.348
Cut to the chase, huh?

28:01.348 --> 28:05.352
I was. I had sex with the dean
and he took it off my record.

28:07.104 --> 28:09.189
Oh, not really.

28:09.189 --> 28:12.401
I was supposed to be at
my friend Tasha's...

28:12.401 --> 28:15.946
...doing an essay,
and went to this rave.

28:15.946 --> 28:19.950
Sunday I was fried and
downloaded this thing off the net.

28:20.909 --> 28:24.413
-Tuesday, I was busted.
-Hey, Hannah!

28:24.413 --> 28:28.417
-Hey! I gotta go.
-Bye.

28:40.012 --> 28:41.972
Hey, Ruby.

28:41.972 --> 28:45.017
My company's driving people
to a premiere.

28:45.017 --> 28:48.979
I gotta make sure everything
runs smooth. Wanna come?

28:49.104 --> 28:53.108
I have homework, three more hours.
Pretty heavy, so....

28:54.735 --> 28:58.739
That's perfect.

29:04.244 --> 29:08.248
Can we catch the end of the movie
or go to the party?

29:16.340 --> 29:18.884
Actually, the hell with Westwood.

29:18.884 --> 29:22.888
-My drivers can handle a premiere.
-Evening, sir.

29:23.597 --> 29:26.850
Mud pie for the lady.
Ketel One, rocks, for me.

29:26.850 --> 29:28.894
Great.

29:28.894 --> 29:30.270
Thank you.

29:30.270 --> 29:34.191
That party'd be a mob scene.
I really want to talk to you.

29:35.567 --> 29:38.904
-Here you are.
-Thank you.

29:38.904 --> 29:42.908
I remember when you guys moved
down the block 11 years ago.

29:43.784 --> 29:47.788
It was funny. I noticed the furniture
as they brought it in.

29:48.372 --> 29:51.208
Erin noticed a little girl.

29:51.208 --> 29:55.212
But you were upset.
I guess about moving cross-country.

29:57.172 --> 29:59.091
You wouldn't say a word.

29:59.091 --> 30:03.095
Just hugged this plastic doll
against your chest.

30:03.512 --> 30:07.516
Malibu Barbie, I think it was.
Prophetic, huh?

30:07.516 --> 30:11.103
Think you mean "pathetic."

30:11.103 --> 30:15.065
No, no.

30:17.192 --> 30:21.196
-I guess you moved on years ago.
-From what?

30:22.990 --> 30:26.994
From hugging plastic dolls.

30:29.288 --> 30:33.292
I should hope so.

30:37.129 --> 30:40.549
Last night, when you fought...

30:40.549 --> 30:42.551
...it wasn't about us, right?

30:42.551 --> 30:46.555
No. Married people sometimes
like to...

30:46.680 --> 30:49.516
...push each other's buttons.

30:49.516 --> 30:53.437
It's a form of intimacy,
a lower form, nothing serious.

30:55.314 --> 30:59.276
One thing I haven't said about Erin:

31:00.444 --> 31:04.406
It can be lonely living with her.

31:08.327 --> 31:12.331
But that's my cross to bear,
not yours.

31:19.171 --> 31:23.175
I think it's past my bedtime, Terry.

31:23.175 --> 31:25.552
Of course it is.

31:25.552 --> 31:29.473
Let's get you to bed.

32:03.382 --> 32:07.344
Terry.

32:07.594 --> 32:11.515
You're not wearing
your shoulder belt.

32:33.287 --> 32:35.080
Hey.

32:35.080 --> 32:39.126
Try not to make too much noise.
Rhett and Erin are asleep.

32:40.794 --> 32:44.715
Okay?

33:18.290 --> 33:22.044
Hamlet senses something's wrong...

33:22.044 --> 33:24.588
...that he alone can set right.

33:24.588 --> 33:27.633
I want two pages next Friday...

33:27.633 --> 33:31.595
...about what he means
and whether he succeeds.

33:47.486 --> 33:51.490
Mr. Begleiter, before my parents--

33:52.324 --> 33:56.328
They ever speak about
guardians for Rhett and me?

33:57.329 --> 34:01.333
Different from the Glasses? No.

34:01.333 --> 34:05.337
-I think they wanted to.
-They discussed it with you?

34:05.504 --> 34:09.507
No, but my parents weren't
friendly with them after they moved.

34:10.092 --> 34:12.886
Ruby, the Glasses aren't your parents.

34:12.886 --> 34:15.347
They'll never be your parents.

34:15.347 --> 34:19.351
-If Erin or Terry has done anything--
-We sleep in one room.

34:21.520 --> 34:22.896
That's not ideal.

34:22.896 --> 34:26.817
The other night we were alone
in Terry's car. He--

34:27.359 --> 34:30.279
What? What did he do?

34:30.279 --> 34:34.283
He just put my seat belt on.

34:34.824 --> 34:38.829
The way he leaned across me wasn't--
It just-- And I felt....

34:40.914 --> 34:44.126
I know it sounds stupid.

34:44.126 --> 34:45.543
And then...

34:45.543 --> 34:49.547
...Erin was shooting up.
I saw her holding a needle.

34:50.674 --> 34:54.136
Anyway, she looked really baked.

34:54.136 --> 34:58.140
Ruby.

34:59.683 --> 35:02.394
Ruby.

35:02.394 --> 35:05.939
Try and understand this.

35:05.939 --> 35:09.401
The accident, in effect...

35:09.401 --> 35:12.279
...orphaned you and your brother.

35:12.279 --> 35:16.283
So if this doesn't work out
with the Glasses...

35:16.700 --> 35:19.286
...you've no place to go.

35:19.286 --> 35:23.290
You'll become wards of the state.

35:23.290 --> 35:26.585
I'm not trying to scare you.

35:26.585 --> 35:30.589
I'm just telling you the facts of life.

35:33.175 --> 35:36.303
I drove halfway here
with the housekeeper...

35:36.303 --> 35:39.848
...and then hitchhiked
and I was scared.

35:39.848 --> 35:43.852
But I told myself once I made it,
you'd help me and Rhett.

35:55.322 --> 35:59.326
When we met, you said
I could trust you.

36:03.622 --> 36:06.208
Okay.

36:06.208 --> 36:10.212
All right.

36:11.338 --> 36:15.342
I believe you. And I know
who to get in touch with.

36:16.885 --> 36:20.889
It's not gonna be easy.
I can't promise you results.

36:22.224 --> 36:26.228
But I promise you that I'll look
into this. You have my word on that.

36:28.522 --> 36:31.984
Thank you.

36:31.984 --> 36:35.988
When we spoke after the funeral...

36:36.822 --> 36:39.658
...you had said that...

36:39.658 --> 36:42.661
...we had more than enough.

36:42.661 --> 36:45.789
How much would that be exactly?

36:45.789 --> 36:49.793
That's a question for the
trust officer at the bank.

36:51.253 --> 36:55.257
But between us,
four million dollars.

36:58.010 --> 37:02.014
So you can see,
you're financially very secure.

37:03.849 --> 37:06.810
Yeah.

37:06.810 --> 37:10.814
Now why don't you go home.
And do me one more favor?

37:10.856 --> 37:13.317
No hitchhiking.

37:13.317 --> 37:17.321
-This is out, okay?
-Yes, sir.

37:36.423 --> 37:40.427
Alvin Begleiter calling.

37:41.720 --> 37:45.724
I just had a disturbing visit
from Ruby Baker.

37:52.439 --> 37:56.026
Rhett, why don't you leave that now?

37:56.026 --> 37:58.737
Go and do some homework.

37:58.737 --> 38:02.741
I have a lot of homework too.

38:02.741 --> 38:06.745
Stay a minute, would you?

38:06.870 --> 38:10.874
What you saw last night
isn't what you think.

38:10.916 --> 38:14.795
Erin suffers from diabetes.

38:14.795 --> 38:16.630
I hid it.

38:16.630 --> 38:20.634
I don't want you or Rhett to worry.
The disease is under control.

38:21.760 --> 38:25.764
You saw Erin giving herself
her nightly insulin injection.

38:26.932 --> 38:30.894
Must've been a shock to walk in on.

38:32.646 --> 38:35.399
One more thing.

38:35.399 --> 38:39.403
Terry tells me that you got a
little skittish with him last night.

38:43.657 --> 38:47.661
That makes us feel sad.
We want you to trust us, Ruby.

38:48.662 --> 38:52.499
We need your trust.

38:52.499 --> 38:55.961
I overreacted, I'm sorry.

38:55.961 --> 38:59.673
There're still things
I need to get used to.

38:59.673 --> 39:02.134
We all do.

39:02.134 --> 39:06.138
We're all under stress.

39:08.140 --> 39:12.144
I'm gonna begin my Hamlet paper.

39:12.144 --> 39:16.148
If you need help, let me know.

39:17.566 --> 39:21.570
That'd be great.

39:27.868 --> 39:31.872
That's fine. Put it in park
and step out.

39:33.707 --> 39:37.628
And Ruby? You'll get behind
the wheel next.

39:43.884 --> 39:47.846
You can apply a bit more gas.

39:53.894 --> 39:56.438
Sorry, I'm a bad driver.

39:56.438 --> 39:59.733
There aren't any bad,
just inexperienced.

39:59.733 --> 40:03.737
Take a breath, start driving back.

40:11.203 --> 40:15.165
Bye.

40:32.224 --> 40:33.225
He's not in now.
I'll have him call you back.

40:33.225 --> 40:37.229
He's not in now.
I'll have him call you back.

40:38.939 --> 40:40.941
Hi.

40:40.941 --> 40:44.903
-I'm Ruby Baker. Terry's--
-I know who you are.

40:45.612 --> 40:48.657
Okay. Cool.

40:48.657 --> 40:51.076
I came to catch a ride from Terry.

40:51.076 --> 40:54.538
He's having a powwow with
some people now.

40:54.538 --> 40:58.542
-If you wanna wait, there's a lounge.
-Okay, thanks.

40:59.126 --> 41:03.088
-Glass Transit, may I help you?
-Any service technician to the office.

41:12.806 --> 41:16.226
-What's going on, Terry?
-The usual.

41:16.226 --> 41:20.230
Not to worry.
Nothing that can't be handled.

41:20.564 --> 41:24.568
-We had a payment plan.
-The dates arrive, the money doesn't.

41:25.611 --> 41:29.281
About that payment plan.
Nicole had a day...

41:29.281 --> 41:31.825
...I'd call it unrealistic.

41:31.825 --> 41:34.536
-You proposed that plan.
-I know.

41:34.536 --> 41:38.540
-It's not dishonesty. We gotta--
-What is it?

41:38.707 --> 41:42.711
NaÃ¯ve optimism.

41:42.878 --> 41:46.298
But I'm an optimist by nature.

41:46.298 --> 41:50.302
I'm betting on myself.

41:51.929 --> 41:55.933
I'll be right there.

42:10.030 --> 42:14.034
-Where's the money?
-You're not listening. The money--

42:16.203 --> 42:20.165
-Say is, as in, "the money is."
-Yeah.

42:50.279 --> 42:52.239
Can I help you?

42:52.239 --> 42:56.243
-Whose car is this?
-Hell if I know. Showed up one day.

42:56.243 --> 43:00.205
-One day, when?
-I don't know. Few months ago?

43:01.081 --> 43:05.085
-We had a car like this.
-You really shouldn't be back here.

43:06.670 --> 43:09.214
Ruby?

43:09.214 --> 43:12.718
Ruby?

43:12.718 --> 43:16.722
What happened was nothing.
Just a business glitch.

43:18.098 --> 43:22.102
Hope you didn't get freaked.
People get weird about money.

43:24.104 --> 43:28.108
I didn't mean to just show up.
I waited for Vicki and she never came.

43:30.277 --> 43:34.281
We had to let her go.
Erin got held up at the hospital.

43:34.406 --> 43:38.410
-Back up. You had to let Vicki go?
-We had to.

43:38.994 --> 43:41.413
She drove you without permission.

43:41.413 --> 43:45.334
Just to Santa Monica,
to the Promenade.

43:47.294 --> 43:50.005
How did you know that she drove me?

43:50.005 --> 43:54.009
How did we know? It's our job to know.

44:25.958 --> 44:29.962
-Did you have a hard day at work?
-It was fine, thanks.

45:19.803 --> 45:22.389
Hamlet.

45:22.389 --> 45:26.393
Don't you hate how he can't
make up his mind?

45:27.519 --> 45:31.440
To be, not be, not not be,
be, be not.

46:15.442 --> 46:19.446
My father drove a Saab.

48:11.475 --> 48:15.437
Terry!

48:15.437 --> 48:18.732
Thank you.

48:18.732 --> 48:22.319
For finishing my paper.

48:22.319 --> 48:26.323
That would be wrong.

48:38.502 --> 48:40.629
-Ruby.
-Yeah?

48:40.629 --> 48:44.341
Come with me.

48:44.341 --> 48:48.345
Sure.

48:56.228 --> 48:59.648
Ruby Baker? I'm Nancy Ryan.

48:59.648 --> 49:03.652
I'm an inspector with Social Services.

49:10.784 --> 49:14.788
Your lawyer said you
have problems with your guardians.

49:18.292 --> 49:22.296
Please relax and be open.
Everything said here stays private.

49:23.130 --> 49:26.425
Okay? So...

49:26.425 --> 49:28.594
...you're 16...

49:28.594 --> 49:32.598
...and your brother is 11,
and you share a bedroom?

49:32.973 --> 49:36.685
Yeah, for now.

49:36.685 --> 49:40.689
And you saw Erin Glass
injecting herself?

49:42.274 --> 49:46.278
-They said she has diabetes.
-Diabetes? I'm gonna check that.

49:49.573 --> 49:53.160
Now it's gonna be in writing twice.

49:53.160 --> 49:56.705
My word still won't count
next to the Glasses.

49:56.705 --> 50:00.709
Which is why I'll phone the Glasses
and ask them to meet me...

50:01.543 --> 50:03.629
...so I can verify everything.

50:03.629 --> 50:06.632
-Okay?
-But...

50:06.632 --> 50:10.177
...how can I live with them?

50:10.177 --> 50:14.181
-Do you wanna live with them?
-Sometimes things are fine.

50:15.182 --> 50:18.852
Last night, Terry helped me
with something...

50:18.852 --> 50:22.856
...but maybe that was
to keep me happy.

50:22.856 --> 50:26.485
I know this is scary for you,
but don't worry.

50:26.485 --> 50:30.489
We tell the guardians that we
perform a routine inspection.

50:32.032 --> 50:34.618
If it's still in progress...

50:34.618 --> 50:38.622
...you just act like we've
never met or spoken.

50:39.206 --> 50:43.210
You have no idea why I'm there. Okay?

50:55.389 --> 50:57.641
This is my husband, Terry Glass.

50:57.641 --> 50:59.601
-Hello.
-Hello.

50:59.601 --> 51:03.605
Is this necessary in the middle
of the day?

51:03.689 --> 51:06.900
We'll get this done
as quickly as possible.

51:06.900 --> 51:10.821
It's intrusive.
Let's get it over with.

51:17.202 --> 51:21.123
-May I...?
-Of course.

51:34.511 --> 51:37.514
Only one child sleeps here?

51:37.514 --> 51:39.600
Yes, Rhett.

51:39.600 --> 51:42.811
And the girl, Ruby,
she has her own room?

51:42.811 --> 51:46.815
-Of course.
-She's 16.

51:56.825 --> 52:00.829
Nice accommodations.

52:03.457 --> 52:06.418
The kids are home.
Do you want to meet them?

52:06.418 --> 52:10.339
Yes, I would. Just to say hi.

52:10.589 --> 52:14.593
But first, Dr. Glass,
may I look upstairs?

52:19.765 --> 52:23.185
This is awkward,
but it's also important.

52:23.185 --> 52:26.730
It's a matter of safety,
so there's nothing...

52:26.730 --> 52:30.734
...dangerous in easy reach.

52:48.502 --> 52:52.464
-"Humulin I and U."
-Diabetes. I'm insulin-dependent.

52:54.883 --> 52:58.887
We have it totally under control.

52:59.346 --> 53:03.350
It would appear that you do.

53:03.976 --> 53:07.980
Here's the two best kids in the world.

53:08.939 --> 53:11.900
Hi, you must be Rhett. I'm Nancy Ryan.

53:11.900 --> 53:13.527
Nice to meet you.

53:13.527 --> 53:17.531
So Rhett, how do you spend
your evenings?

53:17.656 --> 53:21.618
When I finish my homework, I read.

53:25.664 --> 53:29.585
And you must be Ruby.
You have a very nice room.

53:34.381 --> 53:38.260
You've made a wonderful home
for these children.

53:38.260 --> 53:42.264
-Thank you, Dr. Glass.
-Thank you.

53:44.516 --> 53:47.936
We'll see you out.

53:47.936 --> 53:51.940
You read? You lie.

53:52.024 --> 53:56.028
Guess who I learned from?

54:27.309 --> 54:31.313
Bye now.

54:57.965 --> 55:01.969
Why don't we order some dinner, hon?

55:14.356 --> 55:18.360
How do you like your new room?

55:18.485 --> 55:22.406
Couldn't have come at a better time.

55:45.512 --> 55:49.433
Come on, Mr. Begleiter.

56:09.703 --> 56:13.582
-Hello?
-Sorry to disturb you this late.

56:13.582 --> 56:17.586
But I found myself wondering,
"Where's the money?"

56:23.175 --> 56:25.052
You might as well know.

56:25.052 --> 56:29.056
Six months ago I took on a partner.
A silent partner and...

56:30.057 --> 56:34.061
...I recently found out
he was skimming cash.

56:35.020 --> 56:39.024
You've lost me. What does
this have to do with our loan?

56:41.610 --> 56:44.613
I'm waiting, Mr. Glass.

56:44.613 --> 56:48.617
-Mr. Glass, you still there?
-Yeah.

56:50.494 --> 56:53.956
He charged personal
expenses to the company.

56:53.956 --> 56:57.960
When I want a heartbreaking
human interest story...

56:58.627 --> 57:01.505
...I'll watch the news.

57:01.505 --> 57:05.509
Meanwhile, your payment's due
tomorrow, close of business.

57:06.677 --> 57:10.639
Do you fully understand me?

57:14.768 --> 57:17.229
Mr. Glass?

57:17.229 --> 57:20.941
I'm here.

57:20.941 --> 57:24.611
I'm seeking full restitution
from my partner.

57:24.611 --> 57:27.614
Plus I found a whole new
source of equity.

57:27.614 --> 57:30.242
My big, new, personal piggy bank.

57:30.242 --> 57:32.953
So you can expect another $30,000.

57:32.953 --> 57:36.957
That barely covers interest.
You need to pay off the principal.

57:37.958 --> 57:41.962
But I need some more time.
Not a lot more time.

57:42.254 --> 57:43.714
A week at the most.

57:43.714 --> 57:47.676
We'll give you two days,
because we like you.

57:47.968 --> 57:51.972
We'd hate for you to find
your beautiful house burnt down...

57:53.015 --> 57:57.019
...with your wife inside.

58:30.010 --> 58:34.014
Yeah?

58:37.601 --> 58:41.605
"I unfold a tale whose
word would harrow up thy soul...

58:41.605 --> 58:43.774
...freeze thy young blood...

58:43.774 --> 58:47.611
...make thy two eyes
start from their spheres...

58:47.611 --> 58:50.656
...and each hair to stand an end.

58:50.656 --> 58:52.950
If thou didst thy father love...

58:52.950 --> 58:56.912
...revenge his foul and unnatural
murder. Murder most foul...

58:58.038 --> 59:02.042
But this most foul,
strange, and unnatural...."

59:08.340 --> 59:09.758
Begleiterand Brice.

59:09.758 --> 59:13.762
-This is Ruby Baker for Mr. Begleiter.
-One moment.

59:17.891 --> 59:21.895
-Did you get my e-mail?
-No, Terry trashed my account.

59:22.896 --> 59:26.066
Or maybe the bill didn't get paid.

59:26.066 --> 59:28.819
Did you find out about the BMW?

59:28.819 --> 59:31.697
Right, the BMW.

59:31.697 --> 59:34.950
It was registered
to a business: G.T.l.

59:34.950 --> 59:37.661
Glass Transit Incorporated.

59:37.661 --> 59:41.665
-Terry's company.
-Now don't you get it?

59:42.708 --> 59:46.670
Ruby, please come with me.

59:47.129 --> 59:51.133
I have to call you back later.
Bye-bye.

59:52.259 --> 59:56.221
This is Miss Bassett,
our vice principal.

59:56.847 --> 59:58.265
Ruby.

59:58.265 --> 01:00:02.269
The paper you turned in to Mr. Kim,
that was your work, nobody helped?

01:00:03.145 --> 01:00:07.149
-No.
-Not even Harold Bloom?

01:00:07.149 --> 01:00:11.153
"Dance of contraries,"
didn't sound like a student.

01:00:11.278 --> 01:00:14.990
I found it and other phrases
in Mr. Bloom's book:

01:00:14.990 --> 01:00:17.993
Shakespeare:
The Invention of the Human.

01:00:17.993 --> 01:00:21.997
We were told there's a case of
plagiarism on your school record.

01:00:22.956 --> 01:00:26.877
You understand why we have to
take decisive action--

01:00:26.877 --> 01:00:29.296
You were told?

01:00:29.296 --> 01:00:32.466
-By who?
-That is hardly the issue here.

01:00:32.466 --> 01:00:36.470
This sort of cheating
has to have real consequences.

01:00:36.470 --> 01:00:40.474
We've spoken to your guardians.

01:00:40.474 --> 01:00:42.142
Of course you have.

01:00:42.142 --> 01:00:46.146
Frankly, we're not sure whether
you can continue at this school.

01:00:59.201 --> 01:01:01.203
Well?

01:01:01.203 --> 01:01:05.207
Why don't you ask Terry?

01:01:05.666 --> 01:01:09.670
Or maybe it's time you took
some responsibility.

01:01:11.505 --> 01:01:15.509
Maybe it's time.

01:01:57.134 --> 01:02:00.554
This is Jack Avery.
I'm out of the country...

01:02:00.554 --> 01:02:04.558
...but I'm checking my messages.

01:03:27.599 --> 01:03:31.520
Wake up.

01:03:33.522 --> 01:03:36.483
Don't make a sound.
Get dressed. We're gonna go.

01:03:36.483 --> 01:03:40.487
-Where? With who?
-Away with me.

01:03:40.487 --> 01:03:44.491
-Quit it! You're looking!
-Like there's something to see.

01:03:45.909 --> 01:03:49.288
It's raining. I was sleeping.
I don't wanna go.

01:03:49.288 --> 01:03:53.292
It'll be really fun.

01:03:53.959 --> 01:03:57.838
They're giving away
Dragon Ball Z at Blockbuster.

01:03:57.838 --> 01:04:01.842
We can go and avoid the rush.

01:04:01.967 --> 01:04:05.971
Really?

01:04:17.149 --> 01:04:21.153
Close the door.

01:04:28.994 --> 01:04:32.122
What if they find out?

01:04:32.122 --> 01:04:36.126
I'll take the blame.
Get in the car.

01:04:50.474 --> 01:04:54.478
You don't know what you're doing.

01:05:11.453 --> 01:05:13.163
Wanna slow down a little?

01:05:13.163 --> 01:05:17.167
One thing I learned from Terry:
Buckle up.

01:05:36.645 --> 01:05:40.649
-Terry's gonna kill you!
-Maybe so.

01:05:48.240 --> 01:05:51.952
Turn that off.

01:05:51.952 --> 01:05:55.956
Turn that shit off!

01:05:58.584 --> 01:06:02.588
Look out!

01:06:06.300 --> 01:06:10.012
You almost creamed that guy!

01:06:10.012 --> 01:06:14.016
Right. Turn it off!

01:06:26.236 --> 01:06:28.822
-I wanna go back.
-We're not.

01:06:28.822 --> 01:06:32.117
-What do you mean?
-Figure it out.

01:06:32.117 --> 01:06:36.038
We have to! You tricked me
and now I'm in trouble.

01:06:36.246 --> 01:06:39.041
-The Glasses tricked you.
-What?

01:06:39.041 --> 01:06:43.045
Did not. They're sleeping.

01:06:57.601 --> 01:07:01.605
They were gonna send me away
and you'd stay home with them.

01:07:02.731 --> 01:07:05.484
I like Terry. I like Erin.

01:07:05.484 --> 01:07:09.279
You like the shit they buy you.
You couldn't see it.

01:07:09.279 --> 01:07:11.657
They made you lie
to that social worker.

01:07:11.657 --> 01:07:14.868
I didn't know she was
a social worker.

01:07:14.868 --> 01:07:18.872
You didn't wanna lose
your Nintendo.

01:07:20.040 --> 01:07:23.210
They bought you off.

01:07:23.210 --> 01:07:27.172
-Where are you taking us?
-The point was to get away.

01:07:32.219 --> 01:07:36.181
Crap.

01:07:46.692 --> 01:07:50.654
Don't say anything stupid.

01:07:52.698 --> 01:07:54.783
The highway is closed.

01:07:54.783 --> 01:07:58.787
There's a mudslide.
You need to use Malibu Canyon....

01:08:03.208 --> 01:08:06.795
-Can I see your driver's license?
-My license?

01:08:06.795 --> 01:08:10.799
-And your registration too.
-It's....

01:08:11.842 --> 01:08:15.846
It's over there in all my stuff.

01:08:17.723 --> 01:08:21.727
I think I saw it over here.

01:08:23.687 --> 01:08:27.691
Pull onto the shoulder and step out.

01:08:33.322 --> 01:08:37.326
Officer!

01:08:37.951 --> 01:08:40.412
These are my kids.

01:08:40.412 --> 01:08:42.288
Terry Glass, Glass Transit.

01:08:42.288 --> 01:08:46.292
-We loaned you limos for the parade.
-How are you?

01:08:48.587 --> 01:08:50.589
Rhett, poor baby! Come with me.

01:08:50.589 --> 01:08:53.759
We have a behavior problem
back at home.

01:08:53.759 --> 01:08:57.763
Your sister's going through
a hard time right now.

01:08:57.888 --> 01:09:01.892
-You know, teenage-girl stuff.
-Got you.

01:09:02.350 --> 01:09:06.354
Good luck.

01:09:13.487 --> 01:09:17.491
Move over.

01:09:17.573 --> 01:09:21.578
-You can turn around here.
-Thanks.

01:09:38.220 --> 01:09:42.224
Don't you have anything to say to me?

01:09:43.934 --> 01:09:47.270
You killed my parents.

01:09:47.270 --> 01:09:50.232
That's insane and hurtful.

01:09:50.232 --> 01:09:54.236
You're threatened by your
business associates. I saw it.

01:09:55.404 --> 01:09:58.824
Like Erin said to me,
"We need your trust."

01:09:58.824 --> 01:10:01.702
You need my trust,
$4 million worth.

01:10:01.702 --> 01:10:05.539
I got a business.
My wife's a successful doctor.

01:10:05.539 --> 01:10:09.501
-I got a big, new--
-"Piggy bank."

01:10:11.545 --> 01:10:14.798
That's just words out of context.

01:10:14.798 --> 01:10:18.802
-What about the BMW my dad drove?
-What about it?!

01:10:21.305 --> 01:10:25.309
For their anniversary,
I lent them a Beemer...

01:10:25.309 --> 01:10:28.312
...so Dave wouldn't drive her
in that Saab...

01:10:28.312 --> 01:10:30.856
...which I repainted.

01:10:30.856 --> 01:10:32.983
No good deed goes unpunished.

01:10:32.983 --> 01:10:36.987
In your trashy mind,
you twisted that into--

01:10:36.987 --> 01:10:40.991
What do you think? Cut the steering,
stripped the brakes?

01:10:41.867 --> 01:10:43.035
Yeah.

01:10:43.035 --> 01:10:46.747
It's understandable,
basic psychology.

01:10:46.747 --> 01:10:49.458
You don't wanna blame your dad.

01:10:49.458 --> 01:10:52.294
That he had too much booze
that night.

01:10:52.294 --> 01:10:55.005
Then you'd
ask why your mom and dad...

01:10:55.005 --> 01:10:59.009
...hit the bottle.
Whose behavior drove them to drink?

01:11:18.904 --> 01:11:21.907
Get this straight.

01:11:21.907 --> 01:11:25.869
You and Rhett are mine.

01:11:38.340 --> 01:11:42.344
I suggest you forget your lurid,
adolescent fantasies and start--

01:11:48.517 --> 01:11:51.353
Help!

01:11:51.353 --> 01:11:55.357
-Let me go, bastard!
-Calm down, little girl!

01:12:01.530 --> 01:12:03.949
What's happening out there?

01:12:03.949 --> 01:12:06.410
Your sister is having a tantrum.

01:12:06.410 --> 01:12:10.372
Come on. Come back to bed.

01:12:11.415 --> 01:12:15.377
Let me go! Get off!

01:12:15.669 --> 01:12:19.590
Let go!

01:12:20.132 --> 01:12:24.136
You...!

01:12:28.557 --> 01:12:30.726
Listen hard, Ruby.

01:12:30.726 --> 01:12:33.854
Anything happens to you,
we got Rhett...

01:12:33.854 --> 01:12:36.982
...and all we need is one child.

01:12:36.982 --> 01:12:40.944
Erin! Stop him, please!

01:12:41.570 --> 01:12:45.574
Erin!

01:12:45.991 --> 01:12:49.953
Please come help me, please!
He's not gonna hurt you!

01:12:51.121 --> 01:12:55.125
Erin, please don't! Erin, don't! No!

01:13:01.882 --> 01:13:05.761
Thank you for listening.

01:13:05.761 --> 01:13:09.765
You'll feel better now, Ruby.
Rest, relax.

01:13:29.201 --> 01:13:31.495
-Where to, ladies?
-The mall.

01:13:31.495 --> 01:13:34.039
Time-out.
Has anyone heard from Ruby?

01:13:34.039 --> 01:13:37.960
-Me? Not for a month.
-Same. Won't even answer my e-mails.

01:13:38.669 --> 01:13:42.631
What up with Little Miss Malibu?
Too busy bodysurfing?

01:13:43.465 --> 01:13:47.469
Then we are too busy for her.

01:13:54.977 --> 01:13:58.981
-Hello?
-Where's the rest of our money?

01:13:59.523 --> 01:14:03.068
The bank sent me a check
with the wrong zip code.

01:14:03.068 --> 01:14:06.989
Some incompetent jerk at the bank
inverted the last digits!

01:14:07.906 --> 01:14:11.827
So I'll need another--

01:14:17.082 --> 01:14:20.961
We gotta expand the house,
a wing for the kids.

01:14:20.961 --> 01:14:24.965
Our little boy gets bigger every day,
and the girl is a teen.

01:14:26.258 --> 01:14:30.220
I don't know if you have kids....

01:14:30.929 --> 01:14:34.850
Anyway, construction costs
in Malibu are off the charts.

01:14:36.143 --> 01:14:39.730
I'm estimating a quarter million.

01:14:39.730 --> 01:14:43.692
We'll need to see blueprints.
There's an approval process.

01:14:44.693 --> 01:14:47.821
You can't get them
without an architect.

01:14:47.821 --> 01:14:51.742
Mine wants a cash down payment.
He's in demand.

01:14:52.284 --> 01:14:56.246
I believe we advanced you...

01:14:56.830 --> 01:15:00.834
...$30,000 for that purpose
just last month.

01:15:00.834 --> 01:15:04.755
But that was for a room,
before I realized I needed a wing.

01:15:05.547 --> 01:15:09.551
Isn't a guardian supposed to
keep the kids comfortable?

01:15:11.553 --> 01:15:13.180
Here's the trust.

01:15:13.180 --> 01:15:17.184
It authorizes me to use money
to enlarge the house.

01:15:17.643 --> 01:15:21.647
And guardians aren't supposed
to suffer economically...

01:15:21.939 --> 01:15:25.901
...in fulfilling their obligations?
I'm paying two tuitions.

01:15:26.777 --> 01:15:30.739
I employ a nanny. The kids see
therapists to deal with the tragedy.

01:15:32.032 --> 01:15:35.285
I plan trips to broaden
their horizons...

01:15:35.285 --> 01:15:39.289
... and it's like a root canal
when I need reimbursement.

01:15:46.338 --> 01:15:50.342
-Where'd you get it?
-You faxed it to us last week.

01:15:50.634 --> 01:15:54.638
I'm surprised to hear you have
both children at Westcott.

01:15:58.058 --> 01:16:02.062
Did I say Westcott? We changed our
minds about it. It's too glitzy.

01:16:04.648 --> 01:16:08.652
-We gotta do what's best for them.
-Isn't that the truth?

01:16:10.195 --> 01:16:13.699
Thank you for waiting.
I'll take your order.

01:16:13.699 --> 01:16:17.369
I need five dozen
10cc syringes fentanyl...

01:16:17.369 --> 01:16:21.081
...and I need two dozen
20cc syringes Demerol.

01:16:21.081 --> 01:16:24.209
We sent up 60 of fentanyl on Monday.

01:16:24.209 --> 01:16:28.130
I doubled the PCA infusion
rate of Demerol in six patients.

01:16:28.797 --> 01:16:30.841
Dr. Glass?

01:16:30.841 --> 01:16:33.260
I'm on the phone with the pharmacy.

01:16:33.260 --> 01:16:36.930
Dr. Wise wants to see you.

01:16:36.930 --> 01:16:40.851
The Medical Director.

01:16:58.869 --> 01:17:01.747
Wake up, Ruby.

01:17:01.747 --> 01:17:05.751
Sleeping Beauty.

01:17:13.258 --> 01:17:17.179
All you do is sleep. It scares me.

01:17:21.141 --> 01:17:25.145
So you're losing your medical license.
That's wonderful.

01:17:26.897 --> 01:17:30.901
-I have a sickness.
-Yeah, it's called self-pity.

01:17:32.069 --> 01:17:36.031
Complicated by being born
without a freaking backbone.

01:17:36.323 --> 01:17:39.284
So I'm weak, am I?

01:17:39.284 --> 01:17:41.787
Maybe I am.

01:17:41.787 --> 01:17:44.957
At least I'm not greedy
and reckless...

01:17:44.957 --> 01:17:47.876
...borrowing a million
from loan sharks--

01:17:47.876 --> 01:17:51.880
Which should've been paid off!
We had a good thing going...

01:17:52.381 --> 01:17:54.800
...till you put your hand in.

01:17:54.800 --> 01:17:57.970
A good thing? You son of a bitch!

01:17:57.970 --> 01:18:01.974
-I was a doctor!
-Yeah, but you became a junkie.

01:18:02.099 --> 01:18:06.061
Not until you did what you did.

01:18:06.478 --> 01:18:10.399
Where were you when I did it?

01:18:12.526 --> 01:18:16.488
Right. I saw an opportunity, Erin.

01:18:17.823 --> 01:18:20.951
I saw an opportunity and grabbed it.

01:18:20.951 --> 01:18:24.955
I had what you didn't.
I had the nerve, the will.

01:18:25.414 --> 01:18:28.959
Since nobody gave me
a chance, I took it.

01:18:28.959 --> 01:18:32.963
I'm not doing this anymore.

01:18:34.381 --> 01:18:36.967
It's already done.

01:18:36.967 --> 01:18:40.971
This is about containing the damage.
Understand?

01:18:43.098 --> 01:18:46.560
Good.

01:18:46.560 --> 01:18:50.147
You know we have to
get rid of the girl.

01:18:50.147 --> 01:18:53.233
Speaking of which, we're dry?

01:18:53.233 --> 01:18:57.154
There's nothing to take care of her,
so I'll get something.

01:19:00.240 --> 01:19:04.244
If I can't find drugs in L.A....

01:19:38.612 --> 01:19:41.073
Hi!

01:19:41.073 --> 01:19:44.910
Wave at the camera, Ruby.
Wave at the camera!

01:19:44.910 --> 01:19:47.579
They can't catch me!

01:19:47.579 --> 01:19:51.500
-Come in the water, Erin!
-Wait! I'm coming too!

01:20:00.217 --> 01:20:04.221
Spin me, Erin! Faster!
-Good girl.

01:21:03.155 --> 01:21:07.117
Rhett. Rhett, move away.

01:21:29.014 --> 01:21:32.184
Erin! It took some doing...

01:21:32.184 --> 01:21:36.146
...but I found some
pharmaceutical morphine.

01:21:38.148 --> 01:21:42.152
Erin?

01:22:03.048 --> 01:22:06.969
God, not now.

01:22:07.344 --> 01:22:10.180
Erin?

01:22:10.180 --> 01:22:14.184
Erin?

01:22:15.352 --> 01:22:19.356
1875 Montego Canyon.

01:22:19.398 --> 01:22:23.360
I thought you'd wanna know.

01:22:29.241 --> 01:22:33.203
Ruby?

01:22:34.621 --> 01:22:38.542
Honey?

01:22:43.255 --> 01:22:47.217
Terry needs to talk to you kids.

01:24:23.105 --> 01:24:26.775
You kids are a handful,
you know that?

01:24:26.775 --> 01:24:30.779
Where's your sister?
Where's your damn sister?

01:24:44.668 --> 01:24:48.672
I should've put you here from day one.

01:25:55.280 --> 01:25:59.284
What's happening?

01:26:06.208 --> 01:26:10.212
He got the Jag.

01:26:23.600 --> 01:26:27.604
-He walked back in the house.
-Keep working.

01:26:57.509 --> 01:27:01.513
He's sleeping.

01:27:05.517 --> 01:27:09.521
He fell asleep.
There's gonna be a change of plans.

01:28:13.502 --> 01:28:16.380
Why would he do that?

01:28:16.380 --> 01:28:17.923
He's bombed!

01:28:17.923 --> 01:28:21.927
He finished a bottle of vodka.
It's right there.

01:28:25.055 --> 01:28:29.059
I see what's weird.

01:28:46.785 --> 01:28:48.662
Begleiter! What's going on?

01:28:48.662 --> 01:28:52.666
You ought to have your
wife take a look at that.

01:28:53.083 --> 01:28:57.129
-She's not home.
-Your office said you were home.

01:28:57.796 --> 01:29:01.800
I kept calling but nobody answered,
so here I am.

01:29:02.843 --> 01:29:06.847
The bank blocked your
guardianship account.

01:29:06.972 --> 01:29:10.726
The officer believes
there's malfeasance.

01:29:10.726 --> 01:29:12.686
The sons of bitches!

01:29:12.686 --> 01:29:15.022
I went out on a limb for you.

01:29:15.022 --> 01:29:18.567
I warned you about the girl's claims...

01:29:18.567 --> 01:29:22.571
...about her accusations, because I
trusted you, as did the Bakers.

01:29:23.155 --> 01:29:26.742
But if you've lied,
the courts will step in.

01:29:26.742 --> 01:29:30.746
If they take these children,
they have no place to go.

01:29:33.040 --> 01:29:37.044
He thought he was helping us.

01:29:50.182 --> 01:29:54.186
Mr. Glass, where are the children?

01:29:55.020 --> 01:29:58.774
At their music lessons.
Their piano lessons.

01:29:58.774 --> 01:30:01.860
Next, I'll have to buy
them a Steinway...

01:30:01.860 --> 01:30:05.781
...and the bank will say,
"Can't they play the kazoo?"

01:30:12.079 --> 01:30:16.083
Shit!

01:30:16.959 --> 01:30:18.502
That's my Testarossa.

01:30:18.502 --> 01:30:22.506
No, that's our Testarossa.
Until we get our money back.

01:30:22.673 --> 01:30:25.217
You planned to skip town today?

01:30:25.217 --> 01:30:27.886
Where'd you get that idea?

01:30:27.886 --> 01:30:31.807
-Your wife called us this morning.
-My wife?

01:30:34.059 --> 01:30:38.063
Before you leave, how about repaying
the loan in one lump cash sum?

01:30:39.940 --> 01:30:42.067
He doesn't have our money.

01:30:42.067 --> 01:30:45.112
-What's going on, Terry?
-Ask him.

01:30:45.112 --> 01:30:49.116
-Your partner?
-Bastard robbed me blind.

01:30:50.075 --> 01:30:54.079
-Oh, my God. I'm leaving.
-No, no, no.

01:30:54.538 --> 01:30:56.081
-You're not.
-Really?

01:30:56.081 --> 01:30:59.126
-We need an explanation.
-From me?

01:30:59.126 --> 01:31:03.130
I have nothing to do with this!

01:31:17.728 --> 01:31:21.273
-Nobody listens anymore.
-Are you happy, Terry?

01:31:21.273 --> 01:31:25.277
Feel good about that?
Terry, you're a troublemaker.

01:31:25.986 --> 01:31:29.990
-That took care of the problem.
-No. We'll discuss this in the car.

01:31:31.033 --> 01:31:34.286
There's nothing to discuss!

01:31:34.286 --> 01:31:37.581
Just walk like a man out to the Jag.

01:31:37.581 --> 01:31:40.834
That was the problem. You solved it.

01:31:40.834 --> 01:31:44.755
The rest is pure profit.

01:31:44.755 --> 01:31:48.175
Not the Jag. The Volvo.

01:31:48.175 --> 01:31:52.179
Wait here for a minute, okay?

01:31:55.599 --> 01:31:59.603
-Nice little drive in our car.
-No! Not in there!

01:31:59.770 --> 01:32:03.190
Not in there! No! Not in there!

01:32:03.190 --> 01:32:05.317
I don't even have the key!

01:32:05.317 --> 01:32:08.153
We got all the keys to all the cars.

01:32:08.153 --> 01:32:10.614
Take the Volvo, not the Jag!

01:32:10.614 --> 01:32:14.034
-Let's go!
-Okay, you win!

01:32:14.034 --> 01:32:16.328
-You win.
-It's over.

01:32:16.328 --> 01:32:19.331
Just please take the Volvo, okay?

01:32:19.331 --> 01:32:21.750
You're making this difficult.

01:32:21.750 --> 01:32:23.961
-Whatever.
-Take the Volvo.

01:32:23.961 --> 01:32:27.965
Brand loyalty. I like that.

01:32:37.808 --> 01:32:39.643
That little bitch!

01:32:39.643 --> 01:32:43.230
You're some kind of joker.
We'll take the Jaguar.

01:32:43.230 --> 01:32:47.234
No!

01:33:43.415 --> 01:33:47.127
You haven't been
to our Tarzana office.

01:33:47.127 --> 01:33:50.005
We got a handball court and a sauna...

01:33:50.005 --> 01:33:54.009
...and way in the back we have
this special room.

01:33:55.052 --> 01:33:59.014
Totally soundproof.

01:34:11.443 --> 01:34:15.364
What the--?

01:34:22.079 --> 01:34:26.041
What the--?

01:35:11.545 --> 01:35:15.549
What'd you do to this car?!
What'd you do to this car?!

01:36:03.889 --> 01:36:07.893
Hi, you guys need some help?

01:36:08.185 --> 01:36:12.189
Yes.

01:36:37.339 --> 01:36:41.343
-Everything under control?
-We got it covered.

01:37:00.237 --> 01:37:04.241
Terry.

01:37:05.951 --> 01:37:09.955
You two kids stay in the car.

01:37:09.955 --> 01:37:13.917
I have a possible T.C.
Southbound, Malibu Canyon.

01:37:13.917 --> 01:37:17.921
-I'll be investigating.
-Copy that.

01:38:02.716 --> 01:38:04.468
I have a rollover T.C...

01:38:04.468 --> 01:38:08.472
...with one fatality.
I'll need two backup units.

01:38:14.019 --> 01:38:17.940
Ruby.

01:38:28.325 --> 01:38:30.202
It's okay.

01:38:30.202 --> 01:38:34.206
Ruby, go! Drive!

01:38:35.749 --> 01:38:39.753
-Where's the stupid key?!
-It's okay!

01:38:40.045 --> 01:38:44.049
We're gonna die here! Let's go!
Come on, find them!

01:38:45.217 --> 01:38:48.095
Ruby!

01:38:48.095 --> 01:38:50.472
I need your help.

01:38:50.472 --> 01:38:52.474
-He's getting closer!
-I got them!

01:38:52.474 --> 01:38:56.478
He's getting closer!

01:38:56.687 --> 01:39:00.649
Drive! Drive! Drive!

01:39:04.069 --> 01:39:07.990
Why are you stopping?!

01:39:10.367 --> 01:39:12.119
It's okay, honey.

01:39:12.119 --> 01:39:16.123
-Buckle up.
-What're you doing?!

01:39:16.999 --> 01:39:21.003
-All's forgiven.
-What're you doing?

01:40:04.171 --> 01:40:08.175
You kids okay?
Go back and wait by my car.

01:40:52.594 --> 01:40:56.598
Things will get easier from here on.

01:40:57.266 --> 01:41:01.186
They already have.

01:41:01.186 --> 01:41:05.190
Let's go home.

01:41:06.305 --> 01:41:12.481
