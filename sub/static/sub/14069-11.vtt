36:24.803 --> 36:26.136
I wasn't trying

36:26.171 --> 36:27.349
I was trying to help--
I don't believe you!

- Are you telling me

36:28.607 --> 36:30.107
you don't want me
to come back here?

36:30.142 --> 36:31.987
Of course I do, and you
can come back at any time,

36:32.011 --> 36:34.811
but that doesn't mean that--
I don't care what it means.

36:34.847 --> 36:36.191
And just to make it
absolutely clear,

36:36.215 --> 36:37.981
in case there is any doubt,

36:38.017 --> 36:40.350
if by some miracle
the hand of God touches me

36:40.386 --> 36:42.753
and I'm somehow able
to practice law again,

36:42.788 --> 36:45.756
this is the last place

I'm glad you're here.

I don't care what you

Louis, because
all you care about

is proving to me that you
should be managing partner

when everyone in the world
knows that you shouldn't--

37:24.363 --> 37:27.297

Harvey, please!

37:27.333 --> 37:29.110
Jessica didn't even want
your name up on the wall,

let you be managing partner

I was gonna tell him
that he's the one

38:11.910 --> 38:13.643
that should be
managing partner.

38:13.679 --> 38:16.046
Louis, you may
have your flaws,

38:16.081 --> 38:18.415
but he had no right
to talk to you like that.

38:18.450 --> 38:21.318
Yes, he did.

38:21.353 --> 38:23.298
I did everything he said I did,
and the reason I did it

38:23.322 --> 38:25.122
is because
all I ever care about

38:25.157 --> 38:27.457
is for people to see me
as more than I am.

38:27.493 --> 38:29.459
- Louis...
- The funny thing is,

38:29.495 --> 38:32.462
all I ended up with
was the shortest,

38:32.498 --> 38:34.431
most humiliating run
as managing partner

38:34.466 --> 38:37.300
in the history of the world.

38:37.336 --> 38:39.136
If you ask me,

38:39.171 --> 38:40.570
you may have had a short run,

but you made your mark.

38:47.546 --> 38:48.690
What are you talking about?

38:48.714 --> 38:50.414
Well, unless I'm mistaken,

38:50.449 --> 38:52.215
we have ten associates
starting tomorrow

38:52.251 --> 38:53.550
who chose to come here

38:53.585 --> 38:56.119
over one of the best law firms
in the city.

38:56.155 --> 38:59.423
They did that
because of you.

38:59.458 --> 39:01.925
It was because of me,
wasn't it?

39:01.960 --> 39:04.094
Yeah.

39:04.129 --> 39:05.962
And you did that
all on your own.

39:05.998 --> 39:08.365
Nobody asked you to do it.

39:08.400 --> 39:11.535
Where I come from,
they call that stepping up.

You're right. It is.

you mention it,

39:21.680 --> 39:23.480
before you hand over
your reins,

39:23.515 --> 39:24.648
there's something you can do

39:24.683 --> 39:26.616
to cement the future
of this firm.

39:26.652 --> 39:27.884
What's that?

39:27.920 --> 39:29.486
Show a little love
to someone

39:29.521 --> 39:32.789

for as long as I've known her.
