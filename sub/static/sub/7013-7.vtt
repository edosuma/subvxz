WEBVTT

00:09.409 --> 00:11.639
What are those?
Oh, Donna.

00:11.711 --> 00:13.975
Did you buy <i>Playboy</i> for me?

00:14.047 --> 00:16.538
No, they're college brochures.

00:16.616 --> 00:20.347
Donna, these people are fully dressed.
That's just not gonna work for me.

00:21.421 --> 00:23.389
My guidance counselor
gave them to me...

00:23.456 --> 00:25.515
but I already told him
I'm going wherever you go.

00:26.760 --> 00:30.924
How did I ever get
a girl as great as you?

00:30.997 --> 00:34.330
- You know you can do better than me, right?
- ( Laughs )

00:34.401 --> 00:37.802
- But you're right next door. It's so easy.
- Right.

00:40.940 --> 00:43.909
Oh, you two make me sick.

00:45.045 --> 00:48.446
Looks like my mom,
but speaks like my dad.

00:50.116 --> 00:52.778
I-I- I'm sorry, I didn't mean that.

00:52.852 --> 00:55.912
That wasn't me talking. That was-
That was-That was the menopause.

00:55.989 --> 00:58.287
No, you don't have to apologize.

00:58.358 --> 01:00.349
We totally get
what you're going through.

01:00.427 --> 01:03.954
Well, thank the Lord!
Fertile Myrtle totally gets it!

01:05.598 --> 01:07.691
- I miss the basement.
- Yeah.

01:11.905 --> 01:15.739
Kitty, I know these past few weeks
have been hard on you-

01:15.809 --> 01:19.540
hard on all of us, really.

01:19.612 --> 01:24.675
But especially hard on you.
I mean, since you found out you were-

01:24.751 --> 01:26.810
Just say it, Red.
Barren.

01:26.886 --> 01:29.616
Well, there's no need
for both of us to say it.

01:31.257 --> 01:33.589
So I got somethin'
to cheer my girl up.

01:33.660 --> 01:37.824
Oh, good, 'cause I finished off
the last bottle this morning.

01:39.866 --> 01:41.857
No, no.

01:41.935 --> 01:44.165
I got you...

01:44.237 --> 01:45.932
a puppy.

01:47.540 --> 01:49.906
He needs someone
to take care of him.

01:49.976 --> 01:54.436
- His mother got run over by a car.
- Did you run over a dog, Red?

01:57.050 --> 02:02.249
No! I just hate to see you sad,
and I thought-

02:02.322 --> 02:05.086
Oh, forget it. I'll take him back
and go to the liquor store.

02:06.759 --> 02:08.783
Well, now wait.
Wait.

02:08.862 --> 02:12.093
He's kind of cute.
Can I hold him?

02:15.468 --> 02:18.767
Oh-ho-ho!

02:18.838 --> 02:23.036
What a little lover boy!
Ooh!

02:23.109 --> 02:27.603
- See? He likes you.
- ( Barks )

02:27.680 --> 02:30.046
Ah, how about that?

02:30.116 --> 02:32.209
He's got menopause too.

I'm gonna go get out of this thing.

03:15.929 --> 03:17.863
- Oh, boo!
- Selfish!

03:19.866 --> 03:22.528
Man, what is with you guys
and this uniform?

03:22.602 --> 03:26.038
It makes us want to corrupt you.

03:27.907 --> 03:32.344
Man, Donna is so awesome.
She can afford to go to any school she wants...

03:32.412 --> 03:35.404
but she wants to go where I go
just so we can be together.

03:35.481 --> 03:37.847
Yeah, she is awesome.
Why is she with you again?

03:39.219 --> 03:42.586
'Cause a good girlfriend
accepts her guy no matter what.

03:42.655 --> 03:44.646
Jackie was always
trying to change me.

03:44.724 --> 03:46.954
''Grow up, Michael.''
''Act your age, Michael.''

03:47.026 --> 03:50.223
''Stop shooting grandmother
with a water pistol, Michael.''

03:51.264 --> 03:53.198
She's 92, Michael.

03:53.266 --> 03:56.827
She had jam on her face!

03:59.005 --> 04:01.200
Well, all I know is...

04:01.274 --> 04:04.004
things with me and Donna
are going really, really well.

04:05.445 --> 04:08.141
This is <i>just</i> about the point
where I screw things up.

04:08.214 --> 04:11.547
- So don't screw it up.
- Fez. ( Chuckles )

04:11.618 --> 04:14.781
Oh, Fez.
( Sighs )

04:14.854 --> 04:17.118
If history has taught us
anything, it's that...

04:17.190 --> 04:19.124
screwing up is my nature.

04:19.192 --> 04:23.424
But you know what I can do... is bank
a little goodwill- do something nice.

04:23.496 --> 04:25.487
- ( Snaps Fingers )
- Buy her a present.

04:25.565 --> 04:28.295
Yep, she deserves it too.
Do you know how many times...

04:28.368 --> 04:31.098
I tried to grab her boob
on the way to California?

04:32.605 --> 04:35.574
And it would've been easier
for her if she would've let me!

04:35.642 --> 04:38.133
'Cause you know me.
I won't stop.

04:38.211 --> 04:40.805
I gotta get Donna
something really special...

04:40.880 --> 04:43.280
something that reminds her
that even though I'm an idiot...

04:43.349 --> 04:45.408
I'm an idiot who loves her.

04:46.486 --> 04:48.477
I got it!
A scented candle!

04:48.554 --> 04:53.082
Chicks can't keep their shirt on
around a scented candle.

04:53.159 --> 04:56.560
Please, the battlefield of love
is littered with guys who give candles.

04:56.629 --> 04:58.563
It's expensive jewelry or nothing.

04:58.631 --> 05:00.963
Look, if you can't
put a price tag on love...

05:01.034 --> 05:03.298
then how do you know
how much it's worth?

05:03.369 --> 05:05.735
Jackie, what kind of crap is that?

05:05.805 --> 05:08.365
- You haven't learned a thing from me.
- Wait.

05:08.441 --> 05:10.375
Steven.
Well, what do you mean?

05:10.443 --> 05:13.970
I mean, romance was created by
corporations to prey on losers...

05:14.047 --> 05:16.572
who think buying nice things
will make somebody love them.

05:16.649 --> 05:19.379
If you ever read anything besides what-
( Scoffs )

05:19.452 --> 05:22.387
Donny Osmond puts on his waffles,
you might learn something.

05:24.057 --> 05:27.857
( Chuckles )
I put whipped cream on my waffles too.

05:29.362 --> 05:31.592
I eat like the stars!

05:33.833 --> 05:38.361
- ( Remote Clicks )
- Hey, when did you get the cute little wiener dog?

05:40.039 --> 05:43.907
No, no, no, no, no!
Not in my chair!

05:43.976 --> 05:45.910
Red Forman!

05:45.978 --> 05:51.507
Schotzie is a helpless, little
animal with four breakable legs.

05:51.584 --> 05:54.348
You can't throw him around the room
like you would Eric!

05:56.089 --> 05:59.058
Red, you don't seem like
the type of guy who'd get a dog...

05:59.125 --> 06:01.218
being that you're unfriendly.

06:03.696 --> 06:09.157
Yeah, I know. I just wanted to do
something to cheer Kitty up.

06:09.235 --> 06:13.001
Well, if you really wanted to cheer her up,
you should've bought her a banjo.

06:20.913 --> 06:22.904
A banjo, Bob?

06:22.982 --> 06:26.247
You can't hold a banjo
and not smile.

06:26.319 --> 06:30.119
You can't hold a potato chip
and not smile.

06:40.800 --> 06:42.768
Yes?

06:42.835 --> 06:45.326
Um, I want to buy
a present for my girlfriend...

06:45.405 --> 06:47.839
you know, that lets her know
how I feel about her.

06:47.907 --> 06:50.740
Oh, no problem.
Oh, oh. Oh.

06:50.810 --> 06:53.677
Would the, uh, lady
like a necklace? Huh?

06:53.746 --> 06:55.737
( Muttering )

07:00.086 --> 07:03.385
- Well, it's- it's nice.
- Yeah.

07:03.456 --> 07:05.754
- It's a little- little creepy.
- Mmm.

07:05.825 --> 07:08.555
Um, it doesn't really say
what I want to say though.

07:08.628 --> 07:10.789
Oh, okay. Okay. Oh! Oh.

07:10.863 --> 07:14.663
- How about a promise ring?
- Oh, don't even...

07:14.734 --> 07:16.998
- get me started on promise rings.
- Really?

07:17.069 --> 07:19.128
Like, once I gave her one,
and she didn't even want it.

07:19.205 --> 07:21.799
- But then she gave me-
- How about that. Look how that shines.

07:21.874 --> 07:24.570
Oh, that's nice, huh?
Uh.

07:24.644 --> 07:27.135
Well, your...
finger hair...

07:27.213 --> 07:29.841
- curling over the ring is kind of ruining it for me.
- Oh.

07:29.916 --> 07:32.146
Does, uh, wearing the merchandise
usually work for you?

07:32.218 --> 07:36.382
I don't know. I'm new here.
I used to work at the lingerie store.

07:39.425 --> 07:42.826
- They fired me.
- Ah, yes. Ah.

07:42.895 --> 07:44.988
I think I know what you're looking for.
Mm-hmm.

07:45.064 --> 07:48.898
How about a diamond ring?
Oh, isn't that gorgeous? Look at that.

07:50.303 --> 07:53.636
- Whoa. ( Chuckles ) That's an engagement ring.
- Mm-hmm.

07:53.706 --> 07:57.540
I'm in high school, man.
That says, uh, too much.

07:58.945 --> 08:03.882
Well, why don't you tell me
what it is you wanna say?

08:03.950 --> 08:06.851
That I love her...

08:06.919 --> 08:08.910
and we should be together forever.

08:08.988 --> 08:12.219
An engagement ring
says that verbatim.

08:13.459 --> 08:16.223
Well, too bad,
'cause I ain't buyin' one.

08:17.497 --> 08:19.465
Well, I refuse
to put on any more jewelry!

08:19.532 --> 08:22.057
Well, thank God for that!

08:27.707 --> 08:29.641
( Clears Throat )

08:29.709 --> 08:32.405
- Would you like to look around a little more?
- Sure.

08:33.412 --> 08:35.403
And sorry about what I said.

08:35.481 --> 08:37.972
- You look-You look really nice.
- Oh.

08:42.889 --> 08:44.823
( Stereo: Rock )

08:44.891 --> 08:47.758
Donna. You, me, tonight
at the water tower.

08:47.827 --> 08:51.888
Make yourself foxy, 'cause you're getting
something pretty special.

08:51.964 --> 08:56.128
Really. A present?
I <i>will</i> get foxy.

08:56.202 --> 08:59.433
Oh, and Donna?
Donna, don't forget to wear flats...

08:59.505 --> 09:02.338
so that Eric can feel like the boy.

09:04.410 --> 09:08.278
So, Forman,
you finally broke down, huh?

09:08.347 --> 09:11.316
- What'd you get her? Earrings? A little bracelet?
- No.

09:11.384 --> 09:13.716
I got her way more
than a piece of jewelry.

09:13.786 --> 09:17.222
I got her a gift
that really says something-

09:17.290 --> 09:19.918
a diamond engagement ring.

09:22.228 --> 09:24.253
As a joke?

09:28.968 --> 09:31.869
No. You guys, I'm gonna
ask Donna to marry me.

09:33.406 --> 09:35.533
As a joke?

09:36.943 --> 09:39.707
The stupid helmet?

09:41.280 --> 09:43.680
Why do I have to wear
the stupid helmet?

09:43.749 --> 09:47.048
Because you're stupid!

09:47.119 --> 09:49.485
You can't ask Donna
to marry you, man!

09:49.555 --> 09:52.922
Why not? I mean, come on. We already know
that we're gonna be together forever.

09:52.992 --> 09:56.120
No, you <i>think</i> that you're
gonna be together forever.

09:56.195 --> 09:58.595
Remember how you were worried
about screwing things up?

09:58.664 --> 10:00.996
This your Bay of Pigs, man.

10:01.067 --> 10:04.867
Yeah, even in my country we weren't
stupid enough to get married in high school.

10:04.937 --> 10:06.871
And we eat bugs!

10:10.142 --> 10:13.270
Forman, what the hell
are you thinking?

10:13.346 --> 10:15.280
You don't understand, okay?

10:15.348 --> 10:17.714
I love her. I was down
at the store and I realized-

10:17.783 --> 10:19.717
What am I waiting for?
We're happy.

10:19.785 --> 10:22.549
You don't get engaged
when you're happy!

10:22.622 --> 10:26.422
What's the point? You do it when your
back's against the wall and there's no way out...

10:26.492 --> 10:28.722
like if the girl's pregnant.

10:30.162 --> 10:32.926
It is settled, then.
Eric will get Donna pregnant.

10:34.333 --> 10:37.200
I will oversee the proceedings
for verification purposes.

10:38.904 --> 10:41.338
Ah, but he's so stupid,
how do we know he can do it?

10:42.842 --> 10:46.403
-Jackie, help me out here.
- Well, I think it's beautiful.

10:46.479 --> 10:48.504
Well, then you're crazy too.

10:48.581 --> 10:52.278
Look, Steven.
I am my own woman, okay?

10:52.351 --> 10:57.152
I'm allowed to have opinions about jewelry,
you present hater!

11:00.593 --> 11:04.324
Listen, you guys.
I've thought about this a lot, okay?

11:04.397 --> 11:08.356
Donna's willing to commit four years
of college to me. I wanna commit too.

11:08.434 --> 11:10.902
Forman, I say this to you...

11:10.970 --> 11:14.565
as a friend that likes
to see you get hurt.

11:17.376 --> 11:20.311
If you don't take
that ring back right now...

11:20.379 --> 11:24.247
you are going to end up
in a world of misery and pain.

11:24.316 --> 11:27.547
Hey, I love Donna, okay?

11:27.620 --> 11:31.579
So, did it ever occur to any of you
that I'm ready for a world of misery and pain?

11:31.657 --> 11:33.591
Think about that!

11:48.948 --> 11:52.782
Who wants the last piece of salami?

11:56.221 --> 11:58.348
I'll take it.

12:00.092 --> 12:02.560
Who wants the salami?

12:02.628 --> 12:04.926
- I said, I do.
- ( Laughing )

12:04.997 --> 12:07.192
There you go, Schotzie!

12:07.266 --> 12:09.291
I said, I wanted that.

12:10.736 --> 12:13.933
But he was begging, Red.

12:14.006 --> 12:16.167
We don't turn down beggars.

12:17.176 --> 12:20.703
Do we, Schotzie?
No, we don't!

12:20.779 --> 12:24.510
Okay, you guys know more about
relationships than my moron friends...

12:24.583 --> 12:26.517
- so I have a question about me and Donna.
- No.

12:26.585 --> 12:30.453
No more about you and Donna.
You need to be thinking about your future-

12:30.522 --> 12:33.719
college, getting out of my house.

12:35.027 --> 12:37.257
But... Donna <i>is</i> my future.

12:37.329 --> 12:39.763
Honey, we know you love Donna...

12:39.832 --> 12:43.097
but you two are so
on again and off again.

12:43.168 --> 12:46.228
You're probably gonna be
off again sometime soon.

12:46.305 --> 12:49.297
Won't they, Schotzie?
Yes, they will!

12:51.577 --> 12:55.946
How about a career? Have you even given
thought to what you're gonna do with your life?

12:56.015 --> 12:59.473
- Yes, Donna and I-
- I think he should be a pharmacist.

13:00.619 --> 13:03.144
Now there's an idea.
You can count.

13:03.222 --> 13:06.157
There's no heavy lifting.

13:06.225 --> 13:09.956
You oughta see him try to wrestle
with that big mop down at the store.

13:10.029 --> 13:14.432
- ( Laughing )
- I don't see what any of this
has to do with me and Donna.

13:14.500 --> 13:17.663
Oh, honey, but you would be
such a good pharmacist.

13:17.736 --> 13:22.969
Your slender fingers are perfect
for picking up tiny pills.

13:23.042 --> 13:25.442
Aren't they, Schotzie?
Yes, they are!

13:25.511 --> 13:28.605
( Laughs )
Did you see that? He just nodded.

13:37.256 --> 13:41.488
Man, everyone's down on me and Donna
getting engaged-you guys, my parents.

13:41.560 --> 13:45.018
Even the Magic 8-Ball said,
''Outlook not so good.''

13:46.899 --> 13:48.992
I just- Lo-

13:49.068 --> 13:51.764
I really think Donna
would love an engagement ring.

13:52.771 --> 13:54.762
Oh, she'll love the ring.

13:54.840 --> 13:58.139
It's the thought behind it
that'll send her running for the hills.

13:58.210 --> 14:00.940
Or, maybe she'll see how smart
it is to get married...

14:01.013 --> 14:03.982
when you're still in high school
and have no money or future.

14:05.150 --> 14:07.675
I know I ran when Jackie
wanted to marry me.

14:07.753 --> 14:10.415
'Cept I ran for California
instead of the hills.

14:10.489 --> 14:12.650
I mean, the beach kicks
the hills's ass!

14:12.724 --> 14:16.160
I mean, there's way more bikinis,
and they usually have a snack bar!

14:21.667 --> 14:26.127
What if you guys are right?
What if she thinks I'm moving too fast?

14:26.205 --> 14:28.969
Man, giving her this ring
is a huge gamble.

14:29.041 --> 14:32.807
Am I man enough to make that bet?
No, no. The answer is no.

14:32.878 --> 14:34.812
You see, Forman?

14:34.880 --> 14:37.872
You tried to do a nice, thoughtful thing,
and you screwed yourself.

14:37.950 --> 14:40.111
It's all about expectations, man.

14:40.185 --> 14:43.484
Like, I've taughtJackie
to think I'm rude and inconsiderate.

14:43.555 --> 14:46.956
I can't disappoint her,
because I'm <i>always</i> disappointing her!

14:48.727 --> 14:53.221
And if I don't give Donna the ring,
what are we gonna do at the water tower?

14:53.298 --> 14:55.562
Oh, God!

14:55.634 --> 14:57.659
I do deserve this!

15:01.273 --> 15:04.333
Does anyone else think
that Schotzie looks like Fez?

15:06.178 --> 15:08.169
That dog is flyin'!

15:10.582 --> 15:13.574
Well, I don't know
what's gotten into Schotzie.

15:13.652 --> 15:16.314
He's so hungry, he went through
three cans of food.

15:18.023 --> 15:21.049
Didn't you, Schotzie?
Yes, I did!

15:21.126 --> 15:23.253
( Giggling )

15:24.997 --> 15:26.988
Hey, Bob, hand me
that remote there, will ya?

15:27.065 --> 15:30.660
No, thanks, Red.
I'd have to buckle my belt.

15:30.736 --> 15:36.436
Well, buckle your belt anyway.
No one wants to see that.

15:39.278 --> 15:42.475
Oh, not again!

15:44.516 --> 15:47.110
There we go.
( Grunts )

15:48.654 --> 15:50.918
What the hell?

15:53.392 --> 15:55.656
Oh, crap!

15:55.727 --> 15:58.594
That's it.
That damn dog's gotta go!

15:58.664 --> 16:02.327
I think he just went, Red.
( Cackling )

16:03.835 --> 16:06.895
- Are you laughin', Bob?
- Your bottom's all wet.

16:06.972 --> 16:09.133
That's just plain funny in my book.

16:09.208 --> 16:12.541
Well, he can't stay.
He's makin' everyone miserable.

16:12.611 --> 16:17.310
I don't know. Kitty's seemed pretty
darn happy the past couple of days.

16:17.382 --> 16:20.476
- Yeah, well-
- Look, Red. You did a nice thing.

16:20.552 --> 16:24.454
Don't spoil it by,
you know, being yourself.

16:28.026 --> 16:31.052
I guess if the incontinent little bastard
makes Kitty happy...

16:31.129 --> 16:33.063
I'll put up with it.

16:33.131 --> 16:36.430
What the hell?
I've never been that happy anyway.

16:36.501 --> 16:39.561
At least, not since I've known you.

16:39.638 --> 16:43.165
Yeah.
Weird coincidence, huh?

16:48.880 --> 16:50.905
Okay. Look, you.

16:50.983 --> 16:53.611
I've been thinking about all
your conspiracy mumbo jumbo...

16:53.685 --> 16:56.119
about presents and diamonds
and buying me stuff.

16:56.188 --> 16:59.783
And I realized that all your paranoid,
delusional crap about romance...

16:59.858 --> 17:02.725
is just a cover-up
for you being cheap!

17:07.499 --> 17:11.367
Okay, first of all, it's not paranoid,
delusional crap.

17:11.435 --> 17:15.065
Advertisers spend billions to make you
think I'm a jerk if I don't buy you jewelry.

17:15.140 --> 17:18.040
And second of all, you're right.
I am cheap.

17:20.979 --> 17:24.142
Well, you'd better quit it.
Because I like to get stuff...

17:24.215 --> 17:26.945
especially shiny stuff.

17:27.019 --> 17:30.614
Would you settle for a cheeseburger
wrapped in tinfoil?

17:32.357 --> 17:34.723
Well, for you I will.
But just know...

17:34.793 --> 17:37.455
that I'm really
lowering my standards.

17:37.529 --> 17:39.861
That makes two of us.

17:41.667 --> 17:43.658
Come on.

17:48.940 --> 17:51.568
So? Huh?

17:51.643 --> 17:54.544
This is romantic, huh?

17:54.613 --> 17:57.081
It's a little more romantic
in the summer...

17:57.149 --> 17:59.811
or any time not below freezing.

17:59.885 --> 18:03.343
- So what am I getting?
- What are you getting?

18:03.422 --> 18:06.550
What... are you...
getting?

18:06.625 --> 18:08.559
This is what you're gettin'.

18:11.563 --> 18:15.499
- A candy bar?
- Well, half a candy bar.

18:15.567 --> 18:19.401
I figured, uh, you know,
we could share it under the stars.

18:19.471 --> 18:21.905
What a delightful...

18:21.973 --> 18:23.964
moonlit snack.

18:24.042 --> 18:27.534
Okay, you're being weird,
and it's freezing out here.

18:27.612 --> 18:30.581
Aw, come on.
It's not that cold.

18:30.649 --> 18:32.583
- Uhh.
- ( Chuckles )

18:33.919 --> 18:38.015
- Eric, why are we up here?
- Okay, I'm sorry, Donna.

18:38.090 --> 18:41.958
I had something that I was gonna give you,
but I realized it was stupid.

18:42.027 --> 18:45.690
Or everyone said it was stupid,
so I just decided against it.

18:45.764 --> 18:49.860
- Well, what was it?
- It was nothing.

18:49.935 --> 18:51.869
Well, it was something.

18:51.937 --> 18:53.996
I mean, I can see
that it was something.

18:54.072 --> 18:57.940
-Just tell me.
- Okay, fine.

19:00.579 --> 19:02.570
I was gonna give you this.

19:05.851 --> 19:08.786
- Oh, my God. Is that a-
- Yeah.

19:09.788 --> 19:12.256
Yeah.
It's stupid, right?

19:12.324 --> 19:15.316
- Yeah.
- ( Chuckles )

19:15.394 --> 19:17.954
And... no.

19:19.064 --> 19:20.998
I don't know.

19:22.401 --> 19:24.869
What would you have done with it?

19:26.338 --> 19:29.102
Well, I don't know.
I guess I would have...

19:29.174 --> 19:31.404
told you how beautiful you are...

19:31.476 --> 19:34.001
and that...

19:34.079 --> 19:36.240
you mean everything to me.

19:38.417 --> 19:40.351
And then...

19:40.419 --> 19:42.751
I would've gone down on one knee...

19:45.357 --> 19:47.348
you know, like this.

19:50.028 --> 19:52.588
And I would've taken your hand...

19:52.664 --> 19:55.258
and taken the ring-

19:58.603 --> 20:00.833
Go ahead.

20:00.906 --> 20:04.603
and I would have put the ring
on your finger...

20:06.144 --> 20:08.078
like this.

20:12.184 --> 20:14.118
Wow.

20:16.054 --> 20:17.988
So, uh-

20:18.056 --> 20:22.390
So, I'll tell you what. Uh, why don't
I just hold on to that until...

20:22.461 --> 20:24.861
you know,
until the real moment comes.

20:24.930 --> 20:27.831
Oh, sure.

20:27.899 --> 20:31.198
Or I could hold on to it.

20:33.071 --> 20:36.404
- You could?
- Yeah.

20:37.876 --> 20:40.140
Eric, I love you, and...

20:40.212 --> 20:42.476
I wanna be with you forever.

20:43.548 --> 20:45.482
Yes.

20:45.550 --> 20:47.609
That's what I told everyone...

20:47.686 --> 20:50.553
and... they made me wear
the stupid helmet.

20:56.294 --> 20:58.387
So, um...

20:59.664 --> 21:02.098
- did we just get-
- I think we did.

21:02.167 --> 21:04.533
Donna, I love you.

21:05.604 --> 21:08.596
- We are so stupid!
- I know, right?

21:25.190 --> 21:27.454
Oh, hey. Here comes your dad.
Put the ring in your pocket.

21:27.526 --> 21:29.892
- Why? He'll be happy for us!
- Oh, yeah?

21:29.961 --> 21:34.898
Hey, Mr. Pinciotti,
what would you do if I, say...

21:34.966 --> 21:38.402
-made a long-term commitment to your daughter?
-Oh, I'd kill ya.

21:40.338 --> 21:43.830
You know what?
A secret engagement is even more romantic.

21:43.909 --> 21:46.537
And... more stupid.
