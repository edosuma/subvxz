00:01.336 --> 00:02.684
KLAUS: Previously on "The Originals"...

00:02.714 --> 00:04.986
FREYA: If this prophecy is fulfilled,

00:05.016 --> 00:06.354
you will all fall.

00:06.384 --> 00:09.324
One by friend, one by foe, and one

00:09.354 --> 00:10.825
by family.

00:10.855 --> 00:13.344
As this mark grows, you'll go mad.

00:13.374 --> 00:16.397
You'll become a relentless ripper.

00:16.427 --> 00:17.460
REBEKAH: Hide my body.

00:17.462 --> 00:18.479
Elijah, do it!

00:18.509 --> 00:19.671
(Gasps)

00:20.548 --> 00:22.631
(Whooshing)

00:25.169 --> 00:26.785
- (Gasps)
- ELIJAH: What the hell did I just see?

00:26.787 --> 00:28.208
Vincent told me he found a way

00:28.238 --> 00:29.876
to extract the serum from Aurora.

00:29.906 --> 00:31.490
If Marcel becomes the beast,

00:31.492 --> 00:32.741
then I won't be able to stop him.

00:32.743 --> 00:34.076
Davina was like a daughter to me,

00:34.078 --> 00:36.136
and you condemned her to
a fate worse than death.

00:36.166 --> 00:37.951
So you will never be safe.

00:37.981 --> 00:40.231
I am nothing less than your worst...

00:40.261 --> 00:41.985
(Sharp squish)

00:43.037 --> 00:44.537
KLAUS: No!

00:45.389 --> 00:46.212
HAYLEY: What happened?

00:46.242 --> 00:47.178
ELIJAH: It's Marcel.

00:47.208 --> 00:48.646
I took his life.

00:50.661 --> 00:52.500
VINCENT: Marcel took that serum
the moment I offered it to him.

00:52.530 --> 00:54.520
So if the Mikaelsons think he's dead,

00:54.550 --> 00:56.293
they're in for a hell of a surprise.

00:57.903 --> 01:01.131
(Crickets chirping)

01:08.412 --> 01:10.362
KLAUS: You're a survivor.

01:10.364 --> 01:13.285
And survivors need names.

01:14.502 --> 01:16.168
How about Marcellus?

01:16.170 --> 01:17.386
Marcellus?

01:18.989 --> 01:22.407
Family can be more than just
those with whom we share blood.

01:22.709 --> 01:24.843
We can choose.

01:31.435 --> 01:32.690
I can't do it.

01:32.720 --> 01:34.495
Now, you once said the
same thing of your reading.

01:34.525 --> 01:35.976
Devote yourself to your music.

01:36.006 --> 01:38.173
Soon you shall be Johann Sebastian Bach.

02:09.939 --> 02:12.156
(Grunts softly)

02:19.817 --> 02:22.367
Were you watching me sleep?

02:22.369 --> 02:24.453
Hmm.

02:24.455 --> 02:25.838
Possibly...

02:27.435 --> 02:29.007
a little.

02:41.438 --> 02:45.696
Despite everything that we've done...

02:45.726 --> 02:49.561
all those we've lost...

02:49.563 --> 02:53.515
we're still here.

02:53.517 --> 02:55.650
You're not alone.

03:06.030 --> 03:08.285
What better life might have awaited you

03:08.315 --> 03:11.533
were another man your father?

03:11.635 --> 03:16.443
All those who have loved
me have lived to regret it.

03:16.954 --> 03:21.226
But I do know this, my littlest wolf.

03:21.558 --> 03:24.396
I will do right by you.

03:26.487 --> 03:28.506
(Footsteps approaching)

03:28.536 --> 03:31.070
What do you want, Elijah?

03:36.540 --> 03:38.577
I'm not foolish enough
to ask your forgiveness,

03:38.579 --> 03:40.245
so I'll say it again.

03:40.667 --> 03:43.415
I had no choice.

03:43.617 --> 03:47.669
We protect this family at any cost.

03:48.789 --> 03:51.957
You think I'm not aware of
how heavy that burden is?

03:52.304 --> 03:54.910
No. I think that this time,

03:54.912 --> 03:58.163
that burden...

03:58.165 --> 04:00.666
is simply too much to bear.

04:13.196 --> 04:15.431
Something isn't right.

04:15.433 --> 04:17.516
Well, you said you put
the prophecy to rest.

04:17.974 --> 04:19.184
So what's the worry?

04:19.653 --> 04:21.437
I didn't sleep last night.

04:21.738 --> 04:24.072
I just had this feeling of dread.

04:24.074 --> 04:25.846
I don't know if it's my own guilt,

04:25.876 --> 04:28.927
or maybe it's my intuition
telling me something's coming.

04:30.588 --> 04:31.980
And what's this?

04:31.982 --> 04:34.849
Your early warning system?

04:35.151 --> 04:36.723
This map is spelled to trace

04:36.753 --> 04:38.568
Niklaus's enemies.

04:39.022 --> 04:41.823
Let's just hope I'm being paranoid.

04:43.091 --> 04:44.114
(Sighs)

04:44.144 --> 04:47.062
(Reciting incantation)

05:03.697 --> 05:05.447
I guess you're not being paranoid

05:05.477 --> 05:06.504
when there is, in fact,

05:06.534 --> 05:08.834
a hoard of killers out to get you.

05:19.680 --> 05:20.918
All this was you?

05:20.948 --> 05:23.654
No. I had help.

05:23.684 --> 05:24.605
Davina Claire.

05:24.635 --> 05:25.884
She's the one that
made sure the Ancestors

05:25.886 --> 05:26.969
were gone for good.

05:28.173 --> 05:29.610
It's the last thing she did.

05:29.640 --> 05:30.828
That means you've done your part.

05:30.858 --> 05:32.558
That just leaves me to do mine.

05:32.560 --> 05:34.643
Are you sure you can?

05:35.475 --> 05:37.368
Am I sure I can?

05:37.753 --> 05:39.370
The whole point of me
taking Lucien's serum

05:39.400 --> 05:41.400
was so I'd have the power
to deal with the Mikaelsons.

05:41.430 --> 05:44.153
Marcel, there's a big difference
between having the power

05:44.155 --> 05:46.071
and actually using the
power to kill somebody.

05:46.073 --> 05:47.406
And these people were your family.

05:47.408 --> 05:49.542
They were my family.

05:49.868 --> 05:51.243
Do you know why I even
bothered pretending

05:51.245 --> 05:53.349
like I hadn't already taken the serum?

05:53.496 --> 05:56.782
I needed to see how
my family would react.

05:56.784 --> 05:59.201
Elijah killed me in cold blood.

06:01.021 --> 06:02.604
Yeah.

06:02.606 --> 06:04.356
So whatever happens
next, they've earned it.

06:04.358 --> 06:06.191
Did the people of New
Orleans earn it, too?

06:06.193 --> 06:08.360
'Cause I've been hearing
the rumors about vampires

06:08.362 --> 06:10.112
just flocking into
town, and it looks to me

06:10.114 --> 06:11.864
like you're dead set on starting a war.

06:11.866 --> 06:13.949
And I need to know what
happens to the innocent people

06:13.951 --> 06:16.201
when they get caught in
the crossfire of that.

06:16.203 --> 06:17.836
No. You got to promise me

06:17.838 --> 06:20.539
you're gonna do what's right
for the people of this city.

06:21.532 --> 06:24.560
That's exactly what I'm gonna do.

06:29.357 --> 06:30.565
Freya's tracking

06:30.595 --> 06:32.067
your sirelings now.

06:32.069 --> 06:33.401
So it won't be long.

06:33.403 --> 06:34.619
Which works for me.

06:34.621 --> 06:36.289
I could use a good fight.

06:36.863 --> 06:39.624
Well, we do have an advantage.

06:40.293 --> 06:41.272
No vampire may enter

06:41.302 --> 06:42.782
this stronghold so long as the deed

06:42.812 --> 06:44.451
remains in Freya's name.

06:44.481 --> 06:45.714
So what?

06:45.744 --> 06:48.467
We hide in here while our
enemies mass at the front gate?

06:48.497 --> 06:50.052
Well, if they're so
determined to die at our hands,

06:50.054 --> 06:51.053
let them come.

06:51.055 --> 06:53.255
(Freya reciting incantation)

07:06.229 --> 07:07.229
No.

07:07.941 --> 07:09.688
(Whooshing, Freya gasps)

07:14.579 --> 07:16.745
(Crowd murmuring nearby)

07:20.034 --> 07:22.618
(Footsteps approaching)

07:41.070 --> 07:43.621
MARCEL: Never thought
it would come to this.

07:43.651 --> 07:47.491
But, as always...

07:48.016 --> 07:52.013
the Mikaelsons made my choice for me.

07:52.365 --> 07:53.921
Marcel.

07:53.951 --> 07:55.105
How?

07:55.135 --> 07:57.886
How are we in your home?

07:59.123 --> 08:01.061
I have friends who can nullify a deed,

08:01.091 --> 08:02.925
- foreclose on a property like that.
- (Snaps fingers)

08:02.927 --> 08:05.002
Or did you mean...

08:05.441 --> 08:08.263
how am I not a rotting corpse?

08:12.170 --> 08:14.436
I thought my friend was dead,

08:14.438 --> 08:16.521
and yet here you are.

08:16.523 --> 08:18.190
So send these fools away,

08:18.192 --> 08:20.275
and let's talk.

08:20.527 --> 08:21.643
You and me.

08:21.645 --> 08:23.812
Is that relief I hear?

08:24.239 --> 08:25.497
Really?

08:25.527 --> 08:27.632
If I hadn't been one step ahead of you,

08:27.634 --> 08:30.024
I would be at the bottom of the river.

08:30.054 --> 08:30.545
ELIJAH: Marcel,

08:30.575 --> 08:32.498
your anger is with me.

08:33.934 --> 08:36.357
I am the one that's responsible
for this crime against you.

08:36.359 --> 08:40.100
One thing I learned sticking
around this family, Elijah,

08:40.130 --> 08:41.501
you take on one of you,

08:41.530 --> 08:43.365
you are taking on all of you.

08:43.857 --> 08:45.283
These guys,

08:45.285 --> 08:49.204
Klaus's sirelings, they're
here to bear witness today.

08:49.206 --> 08:53.091
Are you planning to put on
a little show, Marcellus?

08:53.093 --> 08:55.644
Damned sure that I am.

08:55.674 --> 08:58.230
The fall of the Mikaelsons.

08:58.788 --> 09:00.232
And guess what.

09:01.396 --> 09:03.578
The show has already started.

09:10.770 --> 09:13.234
(Crowd clamoring)

09:13.264 --> 09:14.507
You're gonna have to listen to me now.

09:14.537 --> 09:15.836
You're gonna have to hear me out,

09:15.838 --> 09:17.788
because I understand
what you're going through.

09:17.790 --> 09:19.206
Our connection with the Ancestors

09:19.208 --> 09:20.624
has been severed; it's gone.

09:20.626 --> 09:22.209
What about the vampires?

09:22.239 --> 09:24.857
- (Crowd murmurs agreement)
- Their numbers increase by the hour

09:24.887 --> 09:26.547
while our strength has diminished.

09:26.549 --> 09:28.638
All right. I hear you.

09:28.668 --> 09:30.229
But I need for you to hear me.

09:30.259 --> 09:32.303
Marcel Girard is gonna be back

09:32.305 --> 09:33.174
to running things in
the Quarter soon enough.

09:33.204 --> 09:34.117
- (Crowd grumbles)
- I know. Listen.

09:34.147 --> 09:35.923
Now, I'm not asking you to trust Marcel,

09:35.925 --> 09:37.308
I'm asking you to trust me.

09:37.310 --> 09:39.844
Guys, what happens next, it's up to us.

09:39.846 --> 09:42.313
(Crowd murmuring)

09:44.288 --> 09:45.772
(Exhales)

09:45.802 --> 09:47.585
- Nice speech.
- Thank you.

09:48.186 --> 09:50.055
Except for the part about
the vampires and the witches.

09:50.057 --> 09:51.589
(Chuckles)

09:51.591 --> 09:53.508
Yeah, I still can't
believe all this is real.

09:53.510 --> 09:55.427
Well, you'll get used to that.

09:56.204 --> 09:57.846
Look, I saw something.

09:59.599 --> 10:00.932
Crime scene.

10:02.649 --> 10:04.569
I can't call it in.
I wouldn't even know how to.

10:05.033 --> 10:06.271
But I need you to come with me.

10:06.813 --> 10:08.940
- See for yourself. â€­
- Yeah.

10:10.071 --> 10:12.694
(Gasping)

10:13.697 --> 10:16.030
(Grunts)

10:19.970 --> 10:21.119
What did they do to you?

10:21.121 --> 10:22.587
Poison.

10:22.589 --> 10:23.872
(Groans)

10:23.874 --> 10:25.874
Let's get you out of here.

10:30.130 --> 10:31.629
(Both grunting)

10:37.521 --> 10:38.887
(Panting)

10:41.109 --> 10:42.023
Come on.

10:42.025 --> 10:43.274
Let's go.

10:45.478 --> 10:48.212
KINNEY: A neighbor
called in a disturbance.

10:51.484 --> 10:54.986
Someone was screaming bloody murder.

10:54.988 --> 10:57.922
I get in here, I don't know
whether to call a coroner

10:57.924 --> 11:00.124
or an exorcist.

11:01.728 --> 11:04.045
I mean, what the hell
am I looking at, Vincent?

11:04.047 --> 11:06.119
VINCENT: These are the Strix.

11:06.149 --> 11:07.932
Or what's left of them.

11:07.934 --> 11:09.450
Are they even human?

11:09.452 --> 11:11.436
No, these are far from human, Will.

11:12.074 --> 11:14.656
The guy who did this...

11:15.624 --> 11:17.659
some kind of vampire?

11:18.255 --> 11:19.694
This is not a normal vampire.

11:19.696 --> 11:21.412
(Screaming)

11:24.284 --> 11:25.917
(Grunts)

11:26.786 --> 11:28.836
(Gasping)

11:28.838 --> 11:31.372
(Groaning)

11:31.374 --> 11:33.541
Lie down. Don't move.

11:33.543 --> 11:35.593
(Panting)

11:36.202 --> 11:39.047
The prophecy is coming true.

11:39.049 --> 11:41.466
This is the day Lucien said would come.

11:44.039 --> 11:44.995
No.

11:45.717 --> 11:47.555
There has to be another way out of this.

11:48.401 --> 11:50.224
Especially with your magic.

11:53.446 --> 11:55.897
Here. Drink.

11:55.899 --> 11:57.619
It won't cure you,
but it will help you.

11:57.649 --> 11:58.388
(Moans)

11:58.418 --> 12:01.919
Now, Lucien has an antidote
to the poison in his penthouse.

12:01.921 --> 12:03.721
Even if I was cured,

12:03.723 --> 12:07.341
the power I used to fight
Lucien, it's gone.

12:08.595 --> 12:11.596
There's nothing that
can stop Marcel now.

12:13.266 --> 12:15.266
There might be one thing.

12:15.268 --> 12:17.268
Stay here. Watch Hope.

12:20.106 --> 12:22.607
I know you're hurt. I loved Davina, too.

12:23.777 --> 12:25.827
And it would break her
heart to see you like this.

12:25.829 --> 12:28.196
Don't mention her name.

12:28.198 --> 12:30.581
If it weren't for you,
she'd still be alive.

12:31.618 --> 12:32.583
But she's not.

12:32.585 --> 12:34.585
This is an insult to her memory.

12:34.587 --> 12:35.620
(Grunts)

12:35.622 --> 12:36.921
(Crowd clamoring)

12:38.458 --> 12:39.791
(Screams)

12:40.790 --> 12:41.709
Kol.

12:41.711 --> 12:42.960
(Neck cracks)

12:51.187 --> 12:52.804
(Clamoring continues)

12:55.525 --> 12:56.557
(Arm cracks)

12:56.559 --> 12:58.443
(Screams)

13:00.480 --> 13:01.979
(Panting)

13:03.733 --> 13:07.618
(Crowd cheering)

13:16.409 --> 13:17.792
Stop!

13:20.151 --> 13:21.021
Rebekah.

13:21.051 --> 13:22.216
Hayley has Hope and Freya.

13:22.218 --> 13:24.469
Take our brothers and go now.

13:24.871 --> 13:26.837
Marcel will not hurt me.

13:27.524 --> 13:30.074
Not if he knows what's good for him.

13:33.613 --> 13:35.330
(Groans)

13:38.769 --> 13:41.186
I've only got a short
while before I go mad.

13:42.188 --> 13:43.470
So your explanation

13:43.472 --> 13:45.973
better be quick and it better be good.

13:54.876 --> 13:58.743
(Grunting, panting)

14:00.530 --> 14:01.746
It's not here.

14:01.748 --> 14:03.202
- I can't find it. â€­
- Calm down.

14:03.232 --> 14:04.498
Freya, think.

14:04.938 --> 14:05.950
When you were poisoned before,

14:05.952 --> 14:07.284
Klaus stole an antidote from Lucien.

14:07.286 --> 14:08.452
It has to be here.

14:08.454 --> 14:10.487
There's no other place to look.

14:11.574 --> 14:13.484
If I can't find the cure,

14:13.514 --> 14:14.825
I will die.

14:14.827 --> 14:16.243
KLAUS: Freya!

14:16.245 --> 14:18.412
(Grunting, groaning)

14:24.642 --> 14:25.803
- Elijah... â€­
- Don't.

14:25.805 --> 14:26.971
Please.

14:26.973 --> 14:28.389
(Gasping)

14:28.391 --> 14:30.924
- We'll deal with it later.
- (Hope crying)

14:30.926 --> 14:32.092
I'm going to die.

14:32.094 --> 14:33.258
KLAUS: You're not going to die.

14:33.288 --> 14:34.544
(Chuckles)

14:34.574 --> 14:35.429
That sounds familiar!

14:35.431 --> 14:38.315
Isn't that what you
said to Finn and Cami?

14:39.997 --> 14:41.485
Look, Lucien engineered his venom

14:41.487 --> 14:43.169
from the seven werewolf packs,

14:43.199 --> 14:44.989
so maybe that's the key to a cure.

14:44.991 --> 14:47.107
Oh, great. That's the
first piece in a puzzle

14:47.109 --> 14:49.360
none of us will be alive to solve.

14:49.362 --> 14:50.661
I'm poisoned, Rebekah's hexed,

14:50.663 --> 14:51.983
and our brothers are bitten.

14:52.013 --> 14:53.947
We need three different cures
to three different ailments,

14:53.949 --> 14:55.449
each of which could take years to find,

14:55.451 --> 14:57.451
and none of us will
make it through the day.

15:00.790 --> 15:02.289
REBEKAH: Oh, that doesn't bode well.

15:03.053 --> 15:04.932
Let's cut the niceties.

15:05.370 --> 15:07.294
I need you to cure my brothers
before something's done

15:07.296 --> 15:08.407
that can't be undone.

15:08.437 --> 15:10.070
Oh, there's no going back.

15:10.100 --> 15:11.965
This is a fight to the death,

15:11.967 --> 15:13.183
and I won't lose.

15:13.185 --> 15:14.468
Why are you doing this?

15:14.470 --> 15:16.114
You really need to ask that?

15:16.144 --> 15:18.939
Can you honestly defend them?

15:18.941 --> 15:20.858
After what they did to me?

15:20.860 --> 15:21.814
To Davina?

15:21.844 --> 15:23.294
No.

15:23.446 --> 15:24.912
I cannot defend them.

15:24.914 --> 15:25.881
But they're my family,

15:25.911 --> 15:28.615
and I am begging you to cure them.

15:29.990 --> 15:32.252
There is no cure.

15:35.497 --> 15:37.257
What do you mean, there is no cure?

15:37.459 --> 15:39.409
Elijah is as good as dead.

15:39.411 --> 15:40.827
So is Kol.

15:42.047 --> 15:43.463
Before the night's over,

15:43.465 --> 15:46.212
Klaus will follow along with them.

15:46.585 --> 15:48.752
Who is your next victim?! Me?!

15:50.005 --> 15:52.089
No. No.

15:52.091 --> 15:55.058
Hey, I would never hurt you.

15:57.546 --> 15:59.880
But I'm not backing down.

15:59.882 --> 16:04.551
I am taking back my home,
my city, my freedom.

16:06.889 --> 16:09.264
The Marcel that I knew...

16:09.612 --> 16:12.790
the man that I loved...

16:12.820 --> 16:17.364
never fancied himself
judge, jury and executioner.

16:22.321 --> 16:23.537
(Sighs)

16:24.856 --> 16:26.806
You want justice?

16:28.114 --> 16:29.183
Well, that's a hell of a lot more

16:29.213 --> 16:31.561
than they ever offered me, but...

16:33.148 --> 16:34.564
sure.

16:34.566 --> 16:36.283
Sure.

16:39.612 --> 16:41.238
Let's have justice.

16:43.052 --> 16:44.326
(Gasping)

16:44.356 --> 16:45.492
You know, maybe it's fair

16:45.494 --> 16:48.144
that you and I pay for what
was done to Davina.

16:48.174 --> 16:49.389
â€­No.

16:49.746 --> 16:52.621
Davina didn't want revenge, okay?

16:52.651 --> 16:55.402
Just put me out of my misery!

16:55.404 --> 16:57.320
At least put me to bloody sleep!

16:57.322 --> 16:59.322
(Groans loudly)

17:00.203 --> 17:01.908
(Panting)

17:02.820 --> 17:04.327
KLAUS: Elijah, Hayley's
attending to Hope,

17:04.329 --> 17:06.329
but I can get her for you.

17:07.833 --> 17:10.250
She's struggling with it.

17:11.837 --> 17:14.170
Not our finest moment, Niklaus.

17:16.131 --> 17:17.176
No.

17:23.804 --> 17:26.278
Please take care of her.

17:27.532 --> 17:29.853
I promise you.

17:30.232 --> 17:32.105
And Rebekah.

17:32.107 --> 17:33.190
I will get

17:33.192 --> 17:35.546
our sister, and I will make Marcel pay.

17:35.576 --> 17:36.766
No, brother, no, no.

17:36.796 --> 17:39.446
This was not...

17:39.448 --> 17:40.530
(Inhales sharply)

17:40.532 --> 17:42.791
This was not Marcel.

17:42.821 --> 17:45.202
This was me. This was my fault.

17:45.204 --> 17:48.477
I did all... all of this.

17:48.507 --> 17:50.591
(Panting)

17:56.539 --> 17:59.349
I can't do this without you, Elijah.

18:06.825 --> 18:08.442
Listen to me.

18:08.444 --> 18:10.944
You have to be strong.

18:10.946 --> 18:13.530
We need you.

18:21.540 --> 18:23.957
(Crowd clamoring)

18:36.138 --> 18:37.854
(Phone vibrating)

18:40.893 --> 18:44.061
Nik, it's me. There's an army of
your sirelings eager for blood.

18:44.063 --> 18:46.563
Marcel has them set to tear
apart the city to find you,

18:46.565 --> 18:50.734
but after a brief chat, he's
considered an alternative.

18:50.736 --> 18:52.736
Though I think it might be worse.

18:52.738 --> 18:55.656
He wants you to come back here
and stand trial for your sins.

18:56.909 --> 18:59.493
Before a jury of those
who hate me the most?

18:59.495 --> 19:01.078
Like hell I will.

19:01.080 --> 19:03.080
If you don't, this mob
will hunt you down.

19:03.082 --> 19:04.965
And given their current
frenzy, I can't imagine

19:04.967 --> 19:08.001
they'll show any mercy to you
or anyone standing in their way.

19:18.112 --> 19:20.363
ELIJAH: It's not a trial.

19:20.515 --> 19:23.015
This is suicide.

19:23.217 --> 19:26.696
Take Hayley, take Hope, get
the hell out of the city.

19:26.726 --> 19:27.888
No.

19:29.159 --> 19:30.691
We won't leave here.

19:31.752 --> 19:32.515
KOL: No!

19:32.545 --> 19:34.178
Davina! Please!

19:34.526 --> 19:35.546
No, please don't leave me!

19:35.548 --> 19:36.547
Shh-shh.

19:36.549 --> 19:39.383
(Grunting)

19:40.859 --> 19:42.708
There may be a way to save them.

19:42.738 --> 19:45.272
Then I will move the
world to make it so.

19:45.274 --> 19:46.273
I need time.

19:46.730 --> 19:48.275
You think I should stand trial

19:48.277 --> 19:49.833
before that death-dealing mob?

19:50.005 --> 19:52.138
Well, that's the easy part.

19:52.168 --> 19:53.844
In order to save your family,

19:53.846 --> 19:56.430
you need to come out
of that trial alive.

20:00.903 --> 20:03.103
(Fussing quietly)

20:07.661 --> 20:11.828
â™ª Silence is what I fear â™ª

20:11.830 --> 20:14.390
â™ª Are you â™ª

20:14.420 --> 20:16.533
â™ª Are you here? â™ª

20:16.535 --> 20:18.190
â™ª A tide of tears appeared... â™ª

20:18.220 --> 20:19.703
Klaus, it's too dangerous.

20:19.705 --> 20:21.985
- Let me come with you.
- No, I think not.

20:22.015 --> 20:23.572
Besides, I'm the one they want.

20:24.063 --> 20:25.726
â™ª Kinder â™ª

20:26.412 --> 20:27.761
â™ª You're kinder than me... â™ª

20:27.763 --> 20:31.398
Some time ago, I refused to
trust you with our daughter.

20:31.400 --> 20:32.349
Klaus...

20:32.351 --> 20:35.327
I took you from Hope.

20:37.866 --> 20:39.823
I was wrong.

20:39.825 --> 20:43.982
â™ª I understand you thinking, oh, oh... â™ª

20:44.195 --> 20:45.329
Take care of her.

20:45.331 --> 20:49.449
â™ª Our lies are better than the truth â™ª

20:49.451 --> 20:53.620
â™ª But I can't live it like I'm living â™ª

20:53.622 --> 20:56.540
â™ª I can't live a lie â™ª

20:56.542 --> 21:00.877
â™ª I'm giving up more than I should â™ª

21:00.879 --> 21:05.015
â™ª Forgive me for my frail love... â™ª

21:06.263 --> 21:08.058
Are you ready?

21:08.088 --> 21:10.387
â™ª Like I'm living â™ª

21:10.389 --> 21:13.640
â™ª I can't wait up nights, so tell me... â™ª

21:13.642 --> 21:15.308
Are you?

21:15.310 --> 21:17.527
â™ª And it's enough... â™ª

21:17.529 --> 21:19.062
For Freya's plan to work,

21:19.064 --> 21:22.149
I can't go mad and you can't die.

21:23.535 --> 21:25.786
What are the bloody odds of that?

21:25.788 --> 21:29.373
Wasn't it you who once said I
could talk my way out of hell?

21:29.375 --> 21:33.577
â™ª I'm giving up more than I should â™ª

21:33.795 --> 21:37.549
â™ª So tell me once and it's enough â™ª

21:37.579 --> 21:42.382
â™ª Forgive me for my frail love â™ª

21:49.474 --> 21:51.758
(Crowd clamoring)

21:58.516 --> 22:00.650
(Clamoring continues)

22:10.382 --> 22:12.332
MARCEL: Silence!

22:12.334 --> 22:14.501
(Clamoring fades)

22:16.055 --> 22:18.005
The great Klaus Mikaelson

22:18.007 --> 22:22.426
has decided to grace
us with his presence.

22:22.428 --> 22:24.845
I have nothing to hide, Marcel.

22:24.847 --> 22:29.182
You wish to put me on trial
for my many grievous sins.

22:30.936 --> 22:32.236
Well, go on.

22:32.238 --> 22:34.104
Have at it.

22:34.106 --> 22:36.490
(Crowd cheering)

22:43.670 --> 22:46.087
(Crowd cheering)

22:53.596 --> 22:55.630
Klaus Mikaelson.

22:55.632 --> 22:59.050
Sire to a thousand years'
worth of angry faces.

23:00.437 --> 23:03.788
How does it feel to be this hated?

23:05.725 --> 23:07.525
Go on.

23:07.527 --> 23:09.060
Look at them.

23:11.731 --> 23:14.966
I said, look at them!

23:15.391 --> 23:17.568
They're all yours, after all.

23:18.955 --> 23:20.455
Do you remember him?

23:20.932 --> 23:22.824
1694.

23:22.826 --> 23:24.826
His wife accused Rebekah of witchcraft.

23:25.275 --> 23:26.744
So you turned him

23:26.746 --> 23:30.081
and then compelled him
to drain his wife dry.

23:31.104 --> 23:32.250
Or this man.

23:32.252 --> 23:33.668
He was a simple farmer.

23:33.670 --> 23:35.086
In 1745,

23:35.088 --> 23:37.472
he made the mistake of
owning land that you wanted.

23:37.474 --> 23:39.590
You could've easily taken it.

23:39.592 --> 23:41.259
Instead, you turned him

23:41.261 --> 23:44.011
and then made him burn his
entire village to the ground.

23:45.098 --> 23:47.265
Or this woman.

23:47.267 --> 23:50.322
1891. Her mother had pneumonia.

23:50.352 --> 23:52.736
Coughed all through the night.

23:52.738 --> 23:54.855
You got annoyed.

23:54.857 --> 23:56.746
So you turned them both,

23:56.776 --> 24:00.561
and made her watch as you
burned her mother alive.

24:00.563 --> 24:01.979
Yes, yes, yes.

24:01.981 --> 24:03.647
My sins were terrible indeed.

24:03.649 --> 24:06.150
But they taught the world to fear me,

24:06.152 --> 24:08.808
and that fear protected my family.

24:08.838 --> 24:10.872
Don't preach to me about family!

24:10.874 --> 24:12.456
I was your family once.

24:12.458 --> 24:13.841
Or so you said.

24:13.843 --> 24:15.459
And where did that get me?

24:15.461 --> 24:17.678
I could've left you nameless and alone,

24:17.680 --> 24:19.213
but I didn't.

24:19.215 --> 24:22.350
I took you and I made
you all that you are.

24:22.827 --> 24:24.719
I guess you made everyone here.

24:24.721 --> 24:28.306
Made us all in your image.

24:28.308 --> 24:29.640
Angry,

24:29.642 --> 24:33.110
paranoid, merciless.

24:34.898 --> 24:36.781
Why?

24:38.868 --> 24:41.485
Why even bother siring us?

24:42.298 --> 24:44.739
Were you afraid to be alone?

24:44.741 --> 24:46.824
Was that it?

24:46.826 --> 24:50.494
Did you want to make something
so vile and disgusting,

24:50.496 --> 24:52.914
like you?

24:52.916 --> 24:54.916
In the end, the reason doesn't matter.

24:54.918 --> 24:57.668
You made us, you abandoned us,

24:57.670 --> 25:00.171
and anyone who dared
stand up for themselves,

25:00.173 --> 25:02.840
you took away everything that we loved!

25:02.842 --> 25:06.010
Because that is what you do!

25:07.847 --> 25:09.035
And for that,

25:09.625 --> 25:11.015
you must pay.

25:11.017 --> 25:12.767
(Crowd cheering)

25:20.610 --> 25:22.026
(Kol panting)

25:23.598 --> 25:25.538
- KOL: No! No, don't hurt her!
- Freya!

25:25.568 --> 25:27.203
- Freya, it's getting worse.
- Don't hurt her! Davina!

25:27.233 --> 25:29.183
HAYLEY: Calm down. Calm down, okay?

25:29.185 --> 25:30.184
Davina's gone.

25:30.186 --> 25:32.019
She's gone.

25:32.021 --> 25:34.271
She's at peace now. It's okay.

25:34.273 --> 25:36.273
(Yelling)

25:36.303 --> 25:37.432
(panting)

25:37.462 --> 25:40.032
Brother! Calm yourself.

25:40.919 --> 25:42.185
Are you okay?

25:42.215 --> 25:44.415
Yeah. I'm fine.

25:46.302 --> 25:49.253
(Crowd clamoring)

25:49.255 --> 25:50.838
Enough!

25:50.840 --> 25:53.424
(Crowd quiets)

25:53.426 --> 25:56.644
You will not condemn my brother
before I have had a chance

25:56.646 --> 25:59.146
- to speak on his behalf.
- â€­(Chuckles)

25:59.653 --> 26:01.053
You want to speak?

26:01.308 --> 26:03.267
All right.

26:03.269 --> 26:04.652
Go ahead.

26:12.751 --> 26:16.280
You accuse my brother
of unjust retaliation.

26:17.700 --> 26:19.834
Of killing your loved ones.

26:19.836 --> 26:22.753
But how is he any
different from any of you?

26:22.755 --> 26:26.457
The strong fight to
determine who is strongest,

26:26.459 --> 26:28.292
and my brother is strong!

26:28.294 --> 26:32.596
Yes, he fights for
power, as do all of you.

26:34.350 --> 26:38.302
But his first instinct
is to defend his blood,

26:38.304 --> 26:41.972
as you act to avenge yours.

26:41.974 --> 26:44.558
You say he is guilty, but I ask you,

26:44.560 --> 26:47.728
would anyone here do any less?

26:49.815 --> 26:51.232
MARCEL: That's your argument?

26:51.234 --> 26:53.534
All's fair in defense of the family?

26:53.536 --> 26:55.402
Hmm.

26:55.404 --> 26:57.154
Thing is, Rebekah,

26:57.156 --> 27:00.241
I seem to recall he
punished you, his sister,

27:00.243 --> 27:03.244
for no other reason than fear

27:03.246 --> 27:05.162
that you might love
someone more than him.

27:05.833 --> 27:08.132
We have been together for a millennium.

27:08.134 --> 27:09.750
We were bound to have a few tiffs.

27:09.752 --> 27:13.170
Was it a "tiff" when he
daggered you for loving me?

27:14.112 --> 27:16.590
Was that justice?

27:16.592 --> 27:18.642
Or when he exiled you from the Quarter?

27:18.644 --> 27:20.678
From your family?

27:20.680 --> 27:22.680
- From me?
- Marcel, stop.

27:22.682 --> 27:24.181
You hate him.

27:26.152 --> 27:28.602
You hate him as much as anybody here,

27:28.604 --> 27:32.406
maybe even more, given how
long he has made you suffer.

27:36.195 --> 27:39.029
You know what, Marcel?

27:39.031 --> 27:40.447
You're right.

27:41.250 --> 27:42.866
Rebekah...

27:44.754 --> 27:47.338
You see, I haven't been entirely honest.

27:48.925 --> 27:53.093
Perhaps it's time to
tell the brutal truth

27:53.095 --> 27:57.965
about my dear brother Klaus Mikaelson.

27:57.967 --> 27:59.383
(Giggles)

28:00.686 --> 28:02.603
(Crowd cheering)

28:08.190 --> 28:11.558
(Crowd cheering)

28:11.560 --> 28:13.160
(Crowd quiets)

28:13.162 --> 28:16.613
Yes, he is my brother,

28:17.218 --> 28:21.452
and I have loved him through the ages.

28:22.114 --> 28:24.621
But no one has felt the blunt end

28:24.623 --> 28:26.824
of his ire more than I.

28:26.826 --> 28:30.916
He claims that his actions
are in defense of his family,

28:30.946 --> 28:32.395
but he lies!

28:32.397 --> 28:34.064
Rebekah, you're not well.

28:35.200 --> 28:37.067
The curse has poisoned your mind.

28:37.069 --> 28:38.401
Let her speak!

28:38.403 --> 28:40.287
Yes, Nik.

28:40.289 --> 28:41.955
I would like to speak.

28:42.775 --> 28:44.275
Although, when I speak out of turn,

28:44.277 --> 28:47.495
I often end up with
a dagger in my chest.

28:48.998 --> 28:53.256
You see, my brother, he
cannot handle the brutal truth

28:53.763 --> 28:58.456
that he destroys everything he touches.

29:01.294 --> 29:05.796
You murdered our mother.

29:06.377 --> 29:08.432
And both of your fathers.

29:09.014 --> 29:12.303
You dagger your siblings and
leave us in coffins for decades!

29:12.305 --> 29:14.105
(Panting)

29:14.107 --> 29:15.806
You break our hearts,

29:15.808 --> 29:20.227
you forbid us from finding
love, all because you can't find

29:20.229 --> 29:23.030
any love of your own.

29:23.617 --> 29:26.233
I am envious of all of you.

29:26.635 --> 29:28.719
You have broken free from him.

29:29.559 --> 29:31.722
But I have had no such relief.

29:33.225 --> 29:37.394
Chained to him not
because of a sire link,

29:37.396 --> 29:40.703
but because of a foolish pact
that we made to each other

29:40.733 --> 29:43.517
when we were nothing more than children.

29:45.854 --> 29:50.857
What if he could suffer the way I have?

29:53.112 --> 29:55.278
The way that we all have!

29:57.282 --> 29:58.928
MARCEL: Well...

29:59.374 --> 30:01.418
I think we've heard enough.

30:03.539 --> 30:05.122
Have you come to a decision?

30:05.124 --> 30:07.841
CROWD: Kill him! Kill him!

30:07.843 --> 30:11.294
(Crowd clamoring)

30:11.296 --> 30:13.880
(Elijah shivering)

30:30.315 --> 30:32.616
I saw you.

30:35.444 --> 30:37.821
I had a dream you were...

30:37.823 --> 30:39.873
I was holding you.

30:41.660 --> 30:44.211
You seemed happy.

30:45.167 --> 30:46.830
It wasn't a dream.

30:55.307 --> 30:57.507
And I was happy.

30:59.728 --> 31:01.344
If Niklaus doesn't make it...

31:01.346 --> 31:03.597
- He will make it.
- Listen to me.

31:04.027 --> 31:05.932
Now, you have grieved enough.

31:05.934 --> 31:09.319
You promise me... if not for
yourself, then for Hope...

31:09.321 --> 31:13.824
you will get as far away
from this place as you can.

31:15.744 --> 31:18.161
I want you to be happy.

31:27.206 --> 31:29.790
CROWD: Kill him! Kill him!

31:29.792 --> 31:31.291
(Crowd clamoring)

31:31.293 --> 31:32.375
Enough!

31:32.377 --> 31:34.544
(Crowd quiets)

31:37.883 --> 31:41.885
I'm disappointed in you, Marcellus.

31:41.887 --> 31:46.223
Using my poor, impaired sister
to propagate your vitriol.

31:46.225 --> 31:48.558
It's hardly the mark of a
true leader, wouldn't you say?

31:48.560 --> 31:50.644
Oh, please. You want
the last word, take it.

31:50.646 --> 31:52.112
Then we can finish this.

31:52.114 --> 31:53.563
Look at you.

31:53.565 --> 31:56.316
Outraged over the loss of Davina.

31:56.318 --> 31:59.486
She who routinely betrayed my family.

31:59.488 --> 32:02.072
And in the end, defied

32:02.074 --> 32:03.740
even you.

32:03.742 --> 32:05.408
Perhaps...

32:05.410 --> 32:08.879
you should've warned her what
befalls those who cross me.

32:08.881 --> 32:10.413
Maybe...

32:10.415 --> 32:13.166
what happened to her was your fault.

32:13.168 --> 32:14.417
(Gasps)

32:14.419 --> 32:15.719
No matter.

32:15.721 --> 32:17.921
Davina's death did help

32:17.923 --> 32:20.140
defeat Lucien, so I
suppose you could say

32:20.142 --> 32:22.259
the little witch did
finally prove herself

32:22.261 --> 32:25.312
to be of some minute worth.

32:27.338 --> 32:29.432
And as for you lot...

32:29.434 --> 32:33.492
yes, I murdered your loved ones!

32:34.027 --> 32:35.856
I killed your harlot.

32:36.608 --> 32:38.942
I rid the world of your slum.

32:38.944 --> 32:43.029
And I freed you from
your decrepit mother.

32:43.615 --> 32:45.615
So, what of it?

32:46.102 --> 32:48.618
Each and every one of
you stands here today

32:48.620 --> 32:50.754
because I willed it to be so.

32:50.756 --> 32:55.625
This mockery of a trial is
allowed only because of me.

32:56.962 --> 32:59.179
And your very immortality

32:59.181 --> 33:02.299
is a gift... from me.

33:02.301 --> 33:05.468
A debt that you can never repay.

33:05.470 --> 33:10.640
One that far offsets all
of my supposed crimes.

33:12.144 --> 33:16.863
I... owe... you...

33:17.475 --> 33:19.316
nothing.

33:19.318 --> 33:21.368
So, go on!

33:21.370 --> 33:23.153
Kill me!

33:23.155 --> 33:27.240
I welcome the peace of death
as a reprieve from this tedium.

33:27.242 --> 33:30.377
I will die suffering but a taste

33:30.379 --> 33:33.914
of the agony I have
inflicted upon all of you.

33:34.336 --> 33:39.191
The scales remain in my favor.

33:39.735 --> 33:43.580
And in the end, you will all know

33:43.610 --> 33:45.675
that I won.

33:47.335 --> 33:52.899
You will remember me, Klaus Mikaelson...

33:54.024 --> 33:55.518
your maker.

33:59.241 --> 34:00.991
Death is too good for him!

34:02.361 --> 34:04.027
You have the means to make him suffer.

34:04.029 --> 34:05.445
Let that be his fate!

34:05.447 --> 34:07.697
CROWD: Torture him! Torture him!

34:07.699 --> 34:09.916
(Crowd clamoring)

34:18.460 --> 34:20.460
(Crowd quiets)

34:20.462 --> 34:23.129
Justice...

34:23.130 --> 34:25.465
for Klaus Mikaelson...

34:28.387 --> 34:33.556
should be a fate worse than death.

34:40.565 --> 34:44.199
This blade is imbued with dark magic.

34:44.202 --> 34:47.036
It will cause unending agony.

34:47.039 --> 34:50.907
All the pain that we have
felt at the hands of this man

34:50.909 --> 34:55.245
will pale in comparison
to what he will soon feel

34:55.246 --> 34:59.416
for as long as I decide to let him live.

34:59.418 --> 35:01.551
(Crowd cheering)

35:09.011 --> 35:13.930
For Davina, Diego, Thierry, Gia, Cami

35:13.932 --> 35:16.066
and the boy I used to be.

35:17.269 --> 35:20.570
The one you once called your son.

35:21.940 --> 35:25.658
(Screaming)

35:25.660 --> 35:28.495
(Crowd cheering)

35:35.954 --> 35:38.705
(Phone vibrating)

35:41.143 --> 35:43.594
Rebekah. Is it over?

35:43.596 --> 35:45.396
Nik found a way to stay alive.

35:45.398 --> 35:47.517
Our plan worked.

35:47.840 --> 35:49.733
Now it's up to you, Hayley.

35:50.241 --> 35:52.286
Make his sacrifice count.

35:52.288 --> 35:54.521
(Distant clamoring)

35:54.523 --> 35:57.247
I will. Hang tight.

35:57.277 --> 35:58.776
I'll come for you soon.

35:59.651 --> 36:01.078
Rebekah's dagger.

36:01.080 --> 36:03.280
It has her blood.

36:12.304 --> 36:13.627
â™ª All â™ª

36:13.873 --> 36:15.592
(Reciting incantation)

36:15.594 --> 36:19.179
â™ª Our times have come â™ª

36:25.771 --> 36:28.555
â™ª Here â™ª

36:28.557 --> 36:31.558
â™ª But now they're gone â™ª

36:31.560 --> 36:33.143
(Grunting)

36:33.145 --> 36:35.028
(Chanting louder)

36:39.368 --> 36:44.655
â™ª Seasons don't fear the reaper â™ª

36:46.625 --> 36:50.828
â™ª The wind, the sun or the rain â™ª

36:50.830 --> 36:54.248
â™ª We can be like they are â™ª

36:54.250 --> 36:57.501
â™ª Come on, baby â™ª

36:57.503 --> 37:01.388
â™ª Don't fear the reaper â™ª

37:01.390 --> 37:04.424
â™ª Baby, take my hand â™ª

37:04.426 --> 37:07.761
â™ª Don't fear the reaper â™ª

37:07.763 --> 37:09.480
â™ª We'll be able to fly... â™ª

37:09.649 --> 37:12.432
The king is dead.

37:13.801 --> 37:14.953
The king is dead.

37:14.983 --> 37:17.104
All hail the king.

37:18.008 --> 37:20.941
Can I help you with something, Vincent?

37:20.943 --> 37:26.196
â™ª La, la, la â™ª

37:26.198 --> 37:29.783
â™ª La, la... â™ª

37:30.715 --> 37:32.169
I just bought back your fight gym.

37:32.171 --> 37:34.371
I'm turning it into a church.

37:34.373 --> 37:35.455
Is that so?

37:35.457 --> 37:37.925
That is so, Marcel.

37:37.927 --> 37:40.260
I just saw what you did back there

37:40.262 --> 37:42.045
with all the bodies
and the bloodshed, man,

37:42.047 --> 37:44.431
left for anybody to find.

37:44.433 --> 37:46.850
Reminded me of somebody
else's handiwork.

37:46.852 --> 37:48.352
And I was hoping you
would be different, man,

37:48.354 --> 37:50.103
but I'm starting now
to think that you are

37:50.105 --> 37:52.723
just as dangerous as Klaus Mikaelson.

37:53.702 --> 37:55.142
I did what was necessary.

37:55.144 --> 37:56.810
No, you didn't, Marcel!

37:56.812 --> 37:58.478
That's what the problem is, man!

37:58.480 --> 38:00.531
You don't do what's necessary.

38:00.533 --> 38:04.067
You do what you want to
do, consequences be damned.

38:04.069 --> 38:08.093
The Mikaelsons are gone, so,
yeah, consequences be damned.

38:08.123 --> 38:09.990
Yeah, but my friend was
one of those consequences

38:09.992 --> 38:11.957
that you just damned.

38:11.987 --> 38:14.828
He's hurt real bad
because you got sloppy.

38:15.463 --> 38:16.713
'Cause you're sloppy, man.

38:16.743 --> 38:17.664
So, yeah,

38:17.666 --> 38:20.638
I'm-I'm gonna take the church back,

38:21.007 --> 38:24.004
and I'm making it into a sanctuary.

38:24.599 --> 38:25.839
Anybody can come.

38:25.841 --> 38:28.425
I don't care if they're a human.
I don't care if they're a witch.

38:28.427 --> 38:30.677
I-I don't care if they're a vampire.

38:30.679 --> 38:33.347
As long as they are sick and tired

38:33.349 --> 38:35.515
of the same old, same old that you

38:35.517 --> 38:38.018
and your pathetic family

38:38.020 --> 38:41.405
are "always and forevering" about.

38:42.148 --> 38:44.274
And if you got a problem
with that, Marcel,

38:44.276 --> 38:47.027
I will take a page from your playbook.

38:47.029 --> 38:51.365
â™ª We can be like they are â™ª

38:51.367 --> 38:52.833
â™ª Come on, baby... â™ª

38:52.835 --> 38:54.868
Consequences be damned.

38:54.870 --> 38:55.870
Huh?

38:57.685 --> 38:59.206
Your Highness.

38:59.208 --> 39:00.874
(Clicks heel)

39:00.876 --> 39:04.378
â™ª Don't fear the reaper â™ª

39:04.380 --> 39:08.048
â™ª We'll be able to fly â™ª

39:08.050 --> 39:11.385
â™ª Don't fear the reaper â™ª

39:11.387 --> 39:15.055
â™ª Baby, I'm your man... â™ª

39:15.057 --> 39:19.476
â™ª Baby, I'm your man. â™ª

39:30.406 --> 39:34.408
(Truck door opens, closes)

39:36.245 --> 39:38.545
(Seat belt clicks)

39:39.182 --> 39:41.048
KLAUS: My dearest Hope.

39:41.780 --> 39:44.635
I do not know how this will find you.

39:46.922 --> 39:49.089
As a child full of wonder,

39:49.091 --> 39:51.141
a teenager full of opinions,

39:51.143 --> 39:53.644
or a woman with the world at her feet.

39:53.646 --> 39:56.313
I write to tell you that I love you

39:56.315 --> 39:59.232
and to explain that in
our family's darkest hour,

39:59.859 --> 40:02.769
I was called upon to save my siblings,

40:03.290 --> 40:04.855
and so I did.

40:04.857 --> 40:06.940
â™ª â™ª

40:06.942 --> 40:08.742
KOL: Not exactly what I was expecting.

40:08.744 --> 40:11.078
But I guess beggars can't be choosers.

40:14.377 --> 40:16.038
FREYA: So you like it?

40:16.702 --> 40:18.785
It's what I always dreamed of.

40:18.787 --> 40:21.288
A home away from the city.

40:21.290 --> 40:22.673
Just family.

40:22.675 --> 40:24.254
So this creation,

40:24.284 --> 40:26.793
is this yours or is it Niklaus'?

40:26.795 --> 40:29.046
We're linked to his life force

40:29.048 --> 40:30.931
by the same spell our Aunt Dahlia used

40:30.933 --> 40:32.716
to keep me alive for a thousand years.

40:32.718 --> 40:35.802
I realized it was the only way.

40:35.804 --> 40:37.471
Put us in a deep sleep.

40:37.473 --> 40:40.857
Buy Hayley enough time
to find cures for us all.

40:40.859 --> 40:43.060
Hence the chambre de chasse.

40:43.062 --> 40:45.479
My little addition to the spell.

40:45.481 --> 40:47.280
In here, we can remain together

40:47.282 --> 40:48.704
until we wake.

40:49.240 --> 40:51.154
KLAUS: Please do not mourn me.

40:51.184 --> 40:52.652
Whatever pain I endure,

40:52.654 --> 40:55.288
I do so in service of those I love.

40:55.290 --> 40:57.574
â™ª Breathe... â™ª

40:57.576 --> 41:02.462
My sole regret is that
I will be away from you.

41:02.464 --> 41:04.965
â™ª Breathe... â™ª

41:04.967 --> 41:06.921
He knew.

41:07.586 --> 41:11.138
He had to be the
anchor to Freya's spell.

41:13.058 --> 41:15.509
He saved us.

41:15.511 --> 41:17.677
â™ª Breathe... â™ª

41:18.540 --> 41:20.847
KLAUS: Be good to your mother.

41:20.849 --> 41:24.601
I draw comfort knowing
that she will protect you.

41:24.603 --> 41:28.605
And I know she will not rest
until our family is united.

41:30.943 --> 41:34.995
Until then, my sacrifice
will allow you to grow.

41:34.997 --> 41:37.508
â™ª I see the candle burning... â™ª

41:37.538 --> 41:39.950
To become the beautiful daughter

41:39.952 --> 41:42.502
I can now only imagine.

41:42.504 --> 41:44.871
Please remember that you are the legacy

41:44.873 --> 41:47.040
this family has always desired,

41:47.692 --> 41:50.927
the promise we fought to protect.

41:50.929 --> 41:54.765
You are, and always will be...

41:54.767 --> 41:56.926
our hope.
