Yes. Fine.

Dr. Lewis was
worried about you.

that's all.

married for money...

saw everything,

said a word.

did something

I did not expect.

Mr. Murray was
on his way to meet her,

01:05:09.222 --> 01:05:12.225
But he was too late
to save her.

01:05:14.227 --> 01:05:16.228
He was able
to retrieve the body

01:05:16.228 --> 01:05:18.230
And dispose
of the car

01:05:18.230 --> 01:05:20.232
Before the
authorities arrived.

01:05:22.734 --> 01:05:25.737
When he got the
corpse back here,

01:05:25.737 --> 01:05:27.739
We noticed...

01:05:30.242 --> 01:05:34.246
It was missing
the ring finger

01:05:34.246 --> 01:05:35.747
On her left hand.

01:05:37.249 --> 01:05:39.251
Apparently,
Julie’s sister

01:05:39.251 --> 01:05:40.252
Had the killer
remove it

01:05:40.252 --> 01:05:43.255
As proof of
his accomplishment.

01:05:47.259 --> 01:05:50.262
You're going to kill me,
aren't you?

01:05:57.767 --> 01:05:59.269
Why, not at all.

01:06:03.773 --> 01:06:05.775
But Julie’s sister
might.

01:06:10.280 --> 01:06:12.282
You see, miss McGovern,

01:06:12.282 --> 01:06:13.783
Your excellent
performance

01:06:13.783 --> 01:06:14.784
Convinced her

01:06:14.784 --> 01:06:17.287
That Julie
is still alive.

01:06:20.290 --> 01:06:21.791
She wishes it wasn't so.

01:06:24.294 --> 01:06:26.296
She will pay
a great deal

01:06:26.296 --> 01:06:28.298
For a second chance.

01:06:29.298 --> 01:06:31.300
In chess,
miss McGovern,

01:06:31.300 --> 01:06:33.802
Second chances
are rare...

01:06:34.803 --> 01:06:37.306
But very valuable.

01:06:37.306 --> 01:06:38.807
There.

01:06:38.807 --> 01:06:41.810
That's not
too tight, is it?

01:06:49.317 --> 01:06:52.320
This, my dear,
will make you drowsy.

01:06:52.820 --> 01:06:53.321
No.

01:06:53.821 --> 01:06:55.823
No. No,
I don't want it!

01:06:55.823 --> 01:06:57.825
I don't want it! No.

01:06:57.825 --> 01:06:58.826
No, please. No.

01:06:58.826 --> 01:07:00.328
This will all
make it easier

01:07:00.328 --> 01:07:02.830
To fix, my dear.

01:07:04.332 --> 01:07:05.832
[Doorbell rings]

01:07:17.127 --> 01:07:18.628
Come back here!
Come back!

01:07:18.628 --> 01:07:20.630
My god,
please help me!

01:07:21.131 --> 01:07:22.632
Please help me!
I'm the one who called!

01:07:22.632 --> 01:07:24.634
Please! They're trying
to kill me!

01:07:25.135 --> 01:07:26.136
They're trying to kill me!

01:07:26.136 --> 01:07:27.137
I'm glad you're here.

01:07:27.137 --> 01:07:28.138
Who's trying
to kill you?

01:07:28.138 --> 01:07:30.140
Dr. Lewis: hello, tom.
Don't mind Julie.

01:07:30.140 --> 01:07:31.641
She's a patient of mine.

01:07:32.142 --> 01:07:33.143
Delusional
and very agitated.

01:07:33.143 --> 01:07:34.144
No!

01:07:34.644 --> 01:07:36.146
She doesn't know
what she's saying,

01:07:36.146 --> 01:07:37.146
I'm afraid.

01:07:37.146 --> 01:07:38.647
He's lying!
Don't believe him!

01:07:38.647 --> 01:07:41.149
He's lying! He's crazy.
They're trying to kill me!

01:07:41.149 --> 01:07:42.150
All right, all right.

01:07:42.150 --> 01:07:44.152
He's trying to kill me.

01:07:44.152 --> 01:07:45.653
You can't believe him!

01:07:45.653 --> 01:07:48.156
Julie, please
try to keep calm.

01:07:48.156 --> 01:07:49.657
She has these fits.

01:07:49.657 --> 01:07:50.658
Help me, please!

01:07:50.658 --> 01:07:51.659
Don't listen to him!

01:07:51.659 --> 01:07:52.660
It's all right, tom.

01:07:52.660 --> 01:07:55.163
She's only dangerous
to herself.

01:07:55.163 --> 01:07:57.165
Last night she got hold
of a steak knife

01:07:57.165 --> 01:07:58.666
And cut off
her own finger.

01:07:58.666 --> 01:08:01.169
No! No,
they did this to me!

01:08:01.669 --> 01:08:02.670
Let go of me!

01:08:03.171 --> 01:08:05.173
It took us all morning
to suture the wound,

01:08:05.173 --> 01:08:06.674
Didn't it, Julie?

01:08:06.674 --> 01:08:07.675
Don't call me that.

01:08:07.675 --> 01:08:08.676
My name is
Katie McGovern.

01:08:08.676 --> 01:08:10.678
Tom, do you want
to see her papers?

01:08:10.678 --> 01:08:13.681
Here. This is the statement
of her admission

01:08:14.182 --> 01:08:15.683
To mercy
psychiatric institute.

01:08:15.683 --> 01:08:16.684
That's not me!

01:08:16.684 --> 01:08:18.685
She was admitted there
last winter.

01:08:18.685 --> 01:08:19.685
Please,
look closely.

01:08:20.187 --> 01:08:21.188
That's not me.

01:08:21.188 --> 01:08:22.189
They made me
look like her.

01:08:22.689 --> 01:08:24.191
Please,
it's not me!

01:08:25.692 --> 01:08:28.194
Please, you can't
believe him!

01:08:28.194 --> 01:08:30.696
Oh, god.
You can't believe...

01:08:31.197 --> 01:08:32.198
Oh, no.

01:08:32.698 --> 01:08:33.698
Dr. Lewis:
this is very sad...

01:08:34.200 --> 01:08:35.701
Julie rose is dead.

01:08:37.703 --> 01:08:40.206
Her corpse is in the attic.

01:08:40.706 --> 01:08:41.707
Go look in the attic!

01:08:44.210 --> 01:08:45.211
Please!

01:08:45.211 --> 01:08:46.712
Look in the attic.

01:08:46.712 --> 01:08:50.216
Sometimes her imagination
gets the better of her.

01:08:50.216 --> 01:08:52.718
Please! Go look
in the attic.

01:08:52.718 --> 01:08:54.719
She'll be all right
in a few minutes.

01:08:54.719 --> 01:08:56.220
Hmm. Maybe we ought
to take a look.

01:08:56.220 --> 01:08:58.223
I don't think you should
encourage her.

01:08:58.723 --> 01:08:59.724
I think we should leave.

01:08:59.724 --> 01:09:01.225
Look, john, put the lady's
mind at rest. Go up--

01:09:01.725 --> 01:09:04.229
I really don't think
it's not necessary.

01:09:04.229 --> 01:09:05.229
It can't hurt.
It might calm her down.

01:09:05.729 --> 01:09:07.232
I'm gonna have to write out
a report anyway.

01:09:07.232 --> 01:09:08.733
All right.

01:09:08.733 --> 01:09:10.234
Mr. Murray...

01:09:10.234 --> 01:09:12.737
Take the officers
to the attic.

01:09:14.238 --> 01:09:15.240
The attic?

01:09:17.742 --> 01:09:19.243
Of course, sir.

01:09:19.243 --> 01:09:20.745
Right this way.

01:09:34.756 --> 01:09:36.759
I am sorry
you had to come out

01:09:36.759 --> 01:09:38.261
On such an awful day.

01:09:38.261 --> 01:09:40.263
Well, it's part of the job.

01:09:42.265 --> 01:09:44.267
Are you sorry, Julie?

01:09:47.270 --> 01:09:49.272
It's not heated.

01:10:09.291 --> 01:10:10.792
Would you
look at that.

01:10:10.792 --> 01:10:12.294
What?

01:10:12.294 --> 01:10:14.295
I haven't seen one of
those things in years.

01:10:14.295 --> 01:10:16.797
Oh, Dr. Lewis was once
quite a hunter.

01:10:16.797 --> 01:10:18.299
He wouldn't need to
be much of a hunter

01:10:18.299 --> 01:10:20.801
With one of those.

01:10:30.311 --> 01:10:31.812
Oh, uh...

01:10:34.815 --> 01:10:35.816
Oh.

01:10:40.321 --> 01:10:43.323
I'm going to have to get
a repairman in here.

01:10:43.323 --> 01:10:45.825
Look. She tore this wire
right out

01:10:45.825 --> 01:10:48.328
When she had her attack
this morning.

01:10:49.829 --> 01:10:50.830
Dr. Lewis doesn't
seem to think

01:10:51.331 --> 01:10:53.333
There's much hope
for her.

01:11:11.850 --> 01:11:13.852
Lovely, isn't it?

01:11:13.852 --> 01:11:15.854
90 years old.

01:11:16.855 --> 01:11:18.856
Made for
president Mckinley.

01:11:18.856 --> 01:11:20.358
That right?

01:11:20.358 --> 01:11:23.861
Poor man never got
to play on it, though.

01:11:23.861 --> 01:11:25.863
Shot dead in Cleveland

01:11:25.863 --> 01:11:29.367
The day it was delivered
to the white house.

01:11:29.367 --> 01:11:30.868
You play?

01:11:30.868 --> 01:11:32.870
Now and then.

01:11:33.371 --> 01:11:34.372
Someday
you must come by

01:11:34.872 --> 01:11:35.873
And we'll have
a game.

01:11:39.377 --> 01:11:40.378
Well?

01:11:40.878 --> 01:11:41.879
There's nothing
up there.

01:11:43.381 --> 01:11:44.382
What?

01:11:47.385 --> 01:11:49.387
It was there.

01:11:49.387 --> 01:11:51.889
It was.
I saw her.

01:11:51.889 --> 01:11:54.391
Oh, god.

01:11:54.391 --> 01:11:55.392
Mr. Murray,

01:11:55.892 --> 01:11:57.894
Take her back
to her room

01:11:58.395 --> 01:12:00.396
And see that she
remains there.

01:12:00.896 --> 01:12:01.897
No.

01:12:01.897 --> 01:12:03.399
No, please.

01:12:03.399 --> 01:12:05.401
No. No, please.

01:12:05.401 --> 01:12:06.402
Come on.

01:12:09.905 --> 01:12:11.907
They're going
to kill me.

01:12:11.907 --> 01:12:13.409
Please,
they're lying.

01:12:22.918 --> 01:12:24.420
Madness
is a terrible thing.

01:12:25.421 --> 01:12:26.922
No.

01:12:27.423 --> 01:12:29.424
No. No. No.

01:12:29.424 --> 01:12:30.425
No. No.

01:12:30.425 --> 01:12:31.926
[Banging]

01:12:48.443 --> 01:12:49.944
Aah!

01:12:52.446 --> 01:12:53.947
Aah!

01:12:54.448 --> 01:12:55.449
Aah!

01:12:57.451 --> 01:12:59.953
Aah!

01:12:59.953 --> 01:13:02.456
I wonder sometimes

01:13:02.456 --> 01:13:05.958
Why I don't just
give up on her.

01:13:06.459 --> 01:13:07.460
Stubborn, I guess.

01:13:16.469 --> 01:13:17.853
Rob: it wasn't
making any sense.

01:13:17.853 --> 01:13:19.355
She kept talking
about goldfish.

01:13:19.355 --> 01:13:20.856
Roland: huh?
Goldfish!

01:13:21.357 --> 01:13:22.358
Rob it's got
to be this next exit.

01:13:22.358 --> 01:13:23.359
Why?

01:13:23.359 --> 01:13:24.360
Because
according to this,

01:13:24.360 --> 01:13:25.861
There are only
6 covered bridges

01:13:25.861 --> 01:13:26.862
In this part
of new york state.

01:13:27.363 --> 01:13:27.863
Yeah? So?

01:13:28.364 --> 01:13:28.864
Only 4 of them
go anywhere

01:13:29.365 --> 01:13:29.865
Near the thruway.

01:13:30.366 --> 01:13:30.866
Right.

01:13:31.367 --> 01:13:32.368
According to this,

01:13:32.368 --> 01:13:33.369
Katie said
she was on the road

01:13:33.869 --> 01:13:35.371
About a few hours.
Right.

01:13:35.371 --> 01:13:37.373
Let's figure somewhere
between 2 and 4.

01:13:37.373 --> 01:13:38.874
Ok! Ok!

01:13:38.874 --> 01:13:40.376
So, of the 4
you can get to

01:13:40.376 --> 01:13:41.377
Off the highway,

01:13:41.377 --> 01:13:43.378
One is only an hour
from the city.

01:13:43.378 --> 01:13:44.878
2 are 5 hours
away, minimum.

01:13:44.878 --> 01:13:46.880
The only other one
is just east of here.

01:13:47.381 --> 01:13:49.383
It's about 1/2 a mile
away from the next exit.

01:13:49.383 --> 01:13:50.384
You sure?
Gotta be.

01:13:50.384 --> 01:13:51.885
Why didn't you
say something?

01:14:00.394 --> 01:14:02.396
[Distorted voice]
thank you for taking

01:14:02.896 --> 01:14:05.899
Such good care of my sister.

01:14:05.899 --> 01:14:09.403
She's been through
so much recently.

01:14:09.403 --> 01:14:11.405
[Distorted voice]
Julie...

01:14:11.405 --> 01:14:12.906
You have a visitor.

01:14:12.906 --> 01:14:13.907
Julie.

01:14:16.410 --> 01:14:18.911
I don't think
she can hear us.

01:14:20.913 --> 01:14:24.417
Julie, dear...

01:14:24.417 --> 01:14:29.922
So good to
see you again.

01:14:31.924 --> 01:14:33.426
Mr. Murray,

01:14:33.926 --> 01:14:36.428
Would you
please take her

01:14:36.428 --> 01:14:38.430
Upstairs?

01:14:42.934 --> 01:14:46.438
Up we go.

01:14:59.450 --> 01:15:02.453
Grrr!

01:15:04.455 --> 01:15:06.457
[Roars]

01:15:06.957 --> 01:15:08.959
She became
quite agitated

01:15:09.460 --> 01:15:12.463
When she heard
you were coming.

01:15:13.964 --> 01:15:16.467
It was necessary
to sedate her.

01:16:00.008 --> 01:16:03.011
Julie's told me so much
about you...Evelyn.

01:16:04.513 --> 01:16:06.013
I can imagine.

01:16:06.013 --> 01:16:09.016
Would you care for
a glass of sherry?

01:16:15.523 --> 01:16:17.024
A brandy, perhaps?

01:16:21.528 --> 01:16:22.529
Nothing?

01:16:35.542 --> 01:16:39.045
There is no reason
to be so downhearted.

01:16:46.051 --> 01:16:47.052
After all,
you are getting

01:16:47.553 --> 01:16:50.055
Exactly
what you want.

01:16:50.556 --> 01:16:53.559
She is all yours...

01:16:53.559 --> 01:16:55.561
When I have
what I want!

01:16:55.561 --> 01:16:57.062
Now where is it?

01:16:58.564 --> 01:16:59.565
Nearby.

01:16:59.565 --> 01:17:01.567
You've been told
to bring it with you.

01:17:01.567 --> 01:17:06.071
I've never been one
to do what I was told.

01:17:06.071 --> 01:17:08.073
Didn't Julie
tell you that?

01:17:10.576 --> 01:17:12.077
You grossly
underestimate me,

01:17:12.077 --> 01:17:13.078
My dear.

01:17:18.582 --> 01:17:20.584
I do have
something for you.

01:17:23.587 --> 01:17:24.588
What is it?

01:17:49.112 --> 01:17:52.115
A gamesman
to the very end.

01:17:54.117 --> 01:17:56.118
Oh, I admire that.

01:17:56.118 --> 01:17:59.622
Perhaps I'll have
that sherry after all.

01:17:59.622 --> 01:18:01.624
That's the spirit.

01:18:24.145 --> 01:18:26.648
She's resting comfortably,
Dr. Lewis.

01:18:46.166 --> 01:18:48.669
Every town around here
