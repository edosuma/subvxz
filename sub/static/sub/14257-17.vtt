01:09.376 --> 01:10.564
WHAT? A DUMP?

01:10.794 --> 01:12.946
WE'RE DOING A STORY
ABOUT A GARBAGE DUMP?

01:13.367 --> 01:15.365
NOT ANY GARBAGE
DUMP, VERNON.

01:15.645 --> 01:18.812
I'M TALKING ABOUT THE
GARBAGE DUMP OF THE FUTURE.

01:21.218 --> 01:23.822
I STILL THINK
THE WHOLE IDEA STINKS.

01:25.301 --> 01:28.688
HEY, BOSS, THIS IS
ME CALLING. BEBOP.

01:29.186 --> 01:30.574
REALLY?
AND ALL THE TIME

01:30.809 --> 01:32.808
I THOUGHT
IT WAS SANTA CLAUS.

01:33.399 --> 01:35.803
DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT YOUR
MISSION IS SUPPOSED TO BE?

01:36.396 --> 01:40.746
SURE, BOSS. WE'RE SUPPOSED
TO TAIL THAT TV CREW

01:40.746 --> 01:42.169
AND SEE WHAT
THEY'RE UP TO.

01:42.484 --> 01:46.319
3...2...1.
ROLL TAPE.

01:46.585 --> 01:50.090
THIS IS APRIL O'NEILL
HERE AT OUR CITY'S

01:50.090 --> 01:52.539
BRAND NEW STATE-OF-THE-ART
GARBAGE RECYCLING CENTER.

01:54.239 --> 01:55.986
WHOA, DUDES, IT'S APRIL.

02:00.705 --> 02:04.473
DUDES, APRIL'S ON THE
TUBE WITH A MAJOR STORY!

02:04.837 --> 02:06.954
A MAJOR STORY?

02:07.266 --> 02:08.609
WHY DIDN'T YOU
SAY SO?

02:08.982 --> 02:10.886
I COULD'VE SWORN
I JUST DID.

02:11.745 --> 02:13.795
THIS STATE OF THE
ART RECYCLING CENTER

02:14.051 --> 02:15.285
IS THE LATEST WEAPON

02:15.551 --> 02:17.313
IN THE CITY'S WAR
AGAINST GARBAGE.

02:17.688 --> 02:20.514
WHY DOES MICHELANGELO WANT
TO WATCH A SHOW ABOUT GARBAGE?

02:20.932 --> 02:22.961
DID YOU EVER SEE WHAT
HE PUTS ON HIS PIZZAS?

02:23.241 --> 02:24.540
WAY TO GO, APRIL.

02:24.831 --> 02:27.203
LOOKIN' GOOD...WHOA!

02:29.701 --> 02:32.695
IF APRIL WANTS TO DO A
STORY ABOUT A GARBAGE DUMP,

02:32.975 --> 02:35.180
SHE SHOULD USE
THIS AS HER LOCALE.

02:35.471 --> 02:36.943
ISN'T THIS
EXCITING, FOLKS?

02:37.218 --> 02:38.469
HERE THEY COME,

02:38.764 --> 02:40.510
THE CITY'S FLEET

02:40.510 --> 02:42.228
OF AUTOMATED,
COMPUTER-CONTROLLED

02:42.228 --> 02:43.416
ROBO-GARBAGE TRUCKS

02:43.416 --> 02:45.675
BEING TESTED
FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME.

02:45.881 --> 02:48.971
FRANKLY, IT LEAVES ME
KIND OF BREATHLESS.

02:49.326 --> 02:50.766
GARBAGE SIGHTED.

02:50.979 --> 02:52.293
GARBAGE SIGHTED.

02:52.790 --> 02:54.409
THESE SELF-PROPELLED
TRUCKS

02:54.677 --> 02:56.253
ARE THE PERFECT
SANITATION MACHINE,

02:56.484 --> 02:59.857
THE TRIUMPH OF TECHNOLOGY
OVER CANDY WRAPPERS.

03:00.180 --> 03:03.598
FELLAS, THIS WHOLE GARBAGE
THING IS GIVING ME AN IDEA.

03:03.915 --> 03:06.382
AND WHAT, PRAY TELL
IS THAT, BRAVE LEADER?

03:06.686 --> 03:08.974
IT'S TIME WE CLEANED UP
THIS PLACE.

03:09.310 --> 03:11.134
REALLY, BUD.
THE PAD IS

03:11.387 --> 03:12.867
GETTING KIND
OF FUNKY.

03:13.224 --> 03:17.233
I AGREE. IT LOOKS LIKE
A BUNCH OF ANIMALS LIVE HERE.

03:17.486 --> 03:19.606
OK, THEN.
LET'S GET STARTED.

03:23.313 --> 03:25.969
THANK YOU, APRIL.
I AM MOST GRATEFUL.

03:28.592 --> 03:31.396
I MUST STOP HAVING THOSE
LATE NIGHT SUSHI SNACKS.

03:42.534 --> 03:43.984
ALL RIGHT, APRIL,
WHAT'S NEXT?

03:44.735 --> 03:46.224
I KNOW YOU WON'T
BELIEVE THIS, VERNON,

03:46.607 --> 03:49.304
BUT WE'RE SUPPOSED TO
INTERVIEW THE MAIN COMPUTER.

03:50.154 --> 03:52.957
HOW DO YOU INTERVIEW SOME STUPID
BUNCH OF CHIPS AND TRANSISTORS?

03:54.141 --> 03:56.361
EXACTLY WHOM
ARE YOU CALLING STUPID?

03:56.853 --> 04:02.095
WAIT. DON'T TELL ME.

04:02.530 --> 04:05.918
YOU MUST BE THE DISPOSAL
UNIT MAIN PROCESSOR.

04:06.638 --> 04:08.306
THAT SOUNDS SO FORMAL.

04:08.602 --> 04:10.582
JUST CALL ME
DUMP 1000.

04:11.494 --> 04:13.592
PLEASED TO MEET YOU,
DUMP 1000.

04:13.984 --> 04:15.388
THAT'S SO MUCH BETTER.

04:15.705 --> 04:18.759
WILL YOU EXCUSE ME?
I MUST RESCUE YOUR FRIEND.

04:19.337 --> 04:21.845
HELP!
HELP ME, SOMEONE!

04:22.189 --> 04:24.443
QUICK, DUMP.
DO SOMETHING!

04:24.732 --> 04:26.197
NO PROBLEM, MS. O'NEILL.

04:26.451 --> 04:28.289
I'M PROGRAMMED
TO RETRIEVE GARBAGE.

04:30.254 --> 04:31.487
OH, THANK YOU, THANK YOU!

04:31.844 --> 04:34.029
MEMORIES OF THIS
WILL STAY WITH ME FOREVER.

04:35.574 --> 04:36.633
UGH! ME, TOO.

04:38.912 --> 04:40.129
YO, BEBOP.

04:40.472 --> 04:41.893
FOLLOW ME.

04:51.111 --> 04:52.919
BOSS, WE'RE
AT THE CHUTE.

04:53.398 --> 04:55.056
YOU SURE THIS
IS GONNA WORK?

04:55.302 --> 04:57.863
OF COURSE I'M SURE.
TRUST ME.

04:58.488 --> 05:00.684
I HATE IT
WHEN HE SAYS THAT.

05:08.140 --> 05:09.406
WELL, WHERE
DID YOU END UP?

05:09.721 --> 05:11.762
UH, SOMEPLACE WITH
LOTS OF BUTTONS

05:12.024 --> 05:13.944
AND PRETTY LIGHTS
AND STUFF.

05:14.225 --> 05:16.470
OH, EXCELLENT!
THE MAIN CONTROL ROOM.

05:16.691 --> 05:18.615
DON'T MOVE A MUSCLE
UNTIL I GET THERE.

05:18.874 --> 05:21.339
DON'T WORRY.
WE CAN'T.

05:21.704 --> 05:24.604
THIS IS MY MOST
INGENIOUS PLAN YET--

05:24.817 --> 05:26.720
TO REPROGRAM
THOSE ROBOTRUCKS

05:26.955 --> 05:29.874
TO SEEK OUT TURTLES
INSTEAD OF GARBAGE.

05:30.295 --> 05:34.115
THEN YOU'LL NEED SOMETHING TO
OVERRIDE THEIR MAIN CONTROLS.

05:34.583 --> 05:36.407
AS LUCK WOULD
HAVE IT,

05:36.782 --> 05:40.841
I JUST HAPPEN TO HAVE
SUCH A DEVICE RIGHT HERE.

05:41.220 --> 05:44.449
ALWAYS ONE STEP AHEAD
OF ME, AREN'T YOU, KRANG?

05:44.755 --> 05:49.184
YES, AND THAT'S NOT EASY
FOR SOMEONE WITH NO FEET.

05:50.279 --> 05:52.478
WE USE TURTLE POWER
TO CLEAN AND SCOUR.

05:53.040 --> 05:55.071
YEAH. ALL RIGHT, BOYS!

05:56.740 --> 05:57.703
BANZAI!

05:59.546 --> 06:01.727
DEATH TO ALL DUST BALLS.

06:02.026 --> 06:05.050
THIS SPRING CLEANING
BIT IS A REAL KICK.

06:05.413 --> 06:08.217
HEY, MICHELANGELO, LESS
CHATTER AND MORE CLATTER.

06:08.878 --> 06:09.776
AT THIS RATE,

06:09.979 --> 06:12.932
WE'LL FILL UP ONE OF THOSE
ROBOTRUCKS ALL BY OURSELVES.

06:14.683 --> 06:16.845
THANKS FOR THE
INTERVIEW, DUMP 1000.

06:17.109 --> 06:20.167
YOU'RE QUITE WELCOME, MS.
O'NEILL. IT'S BEEN MY PLEASURE.

06:20.557 --> 06:22.619
BY THE WAY, WHERE
DID VERNON GO?

06:23.037 --> 06:26.578
HE'S PERFECTLY SAFE. I HAD
HIM DRY-CLEANED FOR YOU.

06:27.111 --> 06:29.262
HAVE A NICE DAY.

06:30.433 --> 06:32.101
IF THERE'S ANYTHING
I HATE,

06:32.336 --> 06:34.334
IT'S UPPITY COMPUTERS.

06:35.643 --> 06:37.983
INTRUDER ALERT.
INTRUDER ALERT.

06:38.279 --> 06:40.633
YOU'RE TRESPASSING
IN A RESTRICTED AREA.

06:40.853 --> 06:42.122
GIVE THE PASSWORD.

06:42.880 --> 06:45.742
OPEN SEZ ME?

06:46.077 --> 06:47.733
INCORRECT RESPONSE.

06:48.029 --> 06:50.355
ARMED REACTION.
SEIZE THEM.

06:50.793 --> 06:52.008
HEY, LET GO!

06:52.729 --> 06:53.679
HEY, LET GO!

06:54.986 --> 06:58.143
HEY, LOOK! THE BOSS
IS COMING TO SAVE US.

06:58.448 --> 07:01.125
GEE, JUST LIKE
THE CALVARY.

07:01.354 --> 07:02.538
NOT SO FAST.

07:05.567 --> 07:07.189
I'M TAKING OVER.

07:08.593 --> 07:10.166
ATTENTION, CIRCUIT UNITS.

07:10.166 --> 07:12.069
INTRUDER USING
OVERRIDE DEVICE

07:12.365 --> 07:14.268
TO NULLIFY
MY CIRCUITS.

07:14.268 --> 07:15.688
LOSING...CONTROL.

07:21.440 --> 07:25.267
ALL RIGHT, YOU MISERABLE
MASS OF MICROCIRCUITS,

07:25.514 --> 07:26.877
LISTEN,
AND LISTEN GOOD.

07:27.933 --> 07:29.259
FIRST YOU COMMAND.

07:29.882 --> 07:32.345
ORDER YOUR ROBOTRUCKS
TO SEIZE THE TURTLES.

07:32.626 --> 07:34.140
SEIZE TURTLES?

07:34.767 --> 07:35.923
YOU HEARD ME.

07:36.236 --> 07:38.804
TURTLES. GRAB THEM
WHEREVER THEY ARE.

07:39.042 --> 07:40.677
AND I MEAN NOW.

07:40.943 --> 07:43.300
YES, MASTER.
I WILL DO YOUR BIDDING.

07:44.145 --> 07:45.558
ATTENTION ALL ROBOTRUCKS.

07:45.873 --> 07:48.750
FIND AND CAPTURE TURTLES
WHEREVER THEY ARE.

08:15.825 --> 08:17.432
A MASSIVE WAVE
OF TURTLENAPPING

08:17.648 --> 08:19.400
IS CURRENTLY UNDERWAY
THROUGHOUT THE CITY.

08:19.400 --> 08:22.522
POLICE HAVE NO EXPLANATION
FOR THIS STRANGE OCCURRENCE.

08:22.736 --> 08:24.061
WHEN ASKED TO COMMENT,

08:24.341 --> 08:25.247
THE MAYOR WOULD ONLY SAY,

08:25.247 --> 08:28.961
"FRANKLY, WE HERE AT CITY
HALL, ARE SHELL-SHOCKED."

08:32.171 --> 08:33.455
NO, NO, NO!

08:33.751 --> 08:36.698
YOU'RE BRINGING ME
THE WRONG TURTLES.

08:36.991 --> 08:39.691
YOU ASKED FOR TURTLES.
I BRING YOU TURTLES.

08:39.956 --> 08:44.328
NO! TALKING TO YOU IS LIKE
TALKING TO A MINDLESS ROBOT.

08:44.609 --> 08:47.289
KRANG, DO SOMETHING.

08:47.710 --> 08:51.187
THIS STUPID COMPUTER IS
KIDNAPPING EVERY TURTLE IN TOWN.

08:51.187 --> 08:52.766
GOOD.

08:53.534 --> 08:55.229
DID YOU SAY GOOD?

08:55.573 --> 09:00.348
PRECISELY. DUMP 1000
IS RELENTLESSLY EFFICIENT.

09:00.563 --> 09:01.924
EVENTUALLY IT WILL
BRING YOU

09:02.126 --> 09:05.540
THE TEENAGE MUTANT
NINJA TURTLES.

09:05.883 --> 09:09.914
UNTIL THEN, SHREDDER,
GET OFF MY BACK.

09:11.018 --> 09:12.927
TURTLES.
TURTLES EVERYWHERE.

09:13.153 --> 09:15.852
AND NOT A BLASTED
NINJA AMONG THEM.

09:21.484 --> 09:24.874
THERE. ASSIGNMENT
CLEANUP ACCOMPLISHED.

09:25.275 --> 09:27.698
IT'S LIKE
A DONE DEED, DUDE.

09:28.024 --> 09:29.399
GREAT JOB, FELLAS.

09:30.054 --> 09:33.033
AHH. QUITE A DIFFERENCE.

09:33.281 --> 09:35.669
I MOST DEFINITELY APPROVE.

09:35.669 --> 09:37.692
APRIL TO TURTLES.
COME IN, TURTLES!

09:37.973 --> 09:39.907
WHAT'S UP, APRIL?
ARE YOU IN TROUBLE?

09:40.236 --> 09:43.120
NO, BUT A LOT OF
YOUR DISTANT RELATIVES ARE.

09:43.120 --> 09:46.068
TURTLES ALL OVER THE CITY
ARE BEING TURTLENAPPED!

09:46.280 --> 09:48.554
TURTLENAPPED?
WHY? HOW?

09:48.879 --> 09:49.955
NO ONE KNOWS,

09:50.174 --> 09:54.219
BUT KEEP ALERT. SOMEBODY'S
AFTER TURTLES IN A BIG WAY

09:54.219 --> 09:55.959
AND YOU FELLAS
COULD BE NEXT.

09:56.260 --> 09:57.958
ENOUGH PRIMPING,
APRIL.

09:58.238 --> 09:59.674
WE'VE GOT
A SHOW TO DO.

09:59.674 --> 10:01.404
<i>I GOTTA GO! CIAO.</i>

10:01.768 --> 10:03.386
I DO NOT LIKE THIS.

10:03.623 --> 10:06.585
I HAVE A FEELING YOU TURTLES
MAY BE IN GREAT DANGER.

10:06.791 --> 10:08.442
HEY, WE LAUGH AT DANGER.

10:08.721 --> 10:10.893
SURE, WE'RE HEROES
IN A HALF SHELL--

10:10.893 --> 10:12.660
REMEMBER
THE THEME SONG?

10:13.010 --> 10:15.696
COME ON, AMIGOS. LET'S
TAKE IT TO THE STREETS.

10:15.933 --> 10:17.412
TURTLE POWER!

10:19.333 --> 10:23.511
AHH. TEENAGERS
WILL BE TEENAGERS.

10:36.934 --> 10:38.586
ROBOTRUCK ALERT.

10:38.586 --> 10:40.197
TURTLES AT 4:00.

10:40.496 --> 10:42.519
UH-OH. SOMEONE'S
ON OUR TAIL.

10:44.141 --> 10:45.873
WATCH IT, DUDE, I JUST HAD
MY SHELL

10:45.873 --> 10:51.303
DONATELLO, SEE WHAT YOU
CAN DO TO STOP THAT THING.

10:52.924 --> 10:54.175
LABEL IT STOPPED.

11:02.130 --> 11:05.309
HOW WEIRD. WHY DID IT
COME AFTER US LIKE THAT?

11:05.793 --> 11:08.602
OH, IT'S ALL
MY FAULT, DUDES.

11:08.866 --> 11:12.547
I WAS, OH,
LIKE, LITTERING.

11:14.855 --> 11:17.132
THIS IS CHANNEL 6
CORRESPONDENT

11:17.132 --> 11:18.787
APRIL O'NEILL
AT THE BEACH

11:18.787 --> 11:21.352
WHERE LEADING
TURTLEOLOGISTS HAVE GATHERED

11:21.352 --> 11:24.614
TO OBSERVE A RARE SEA
TURTLE CRAWL UP ON THE BEACH

11:24.614 --> 11:26.019
AND LAY HER EGGS.

11:26.019 --> 11:27.636
YOU AIN'T KIDDING,
RARE.

11:27.872 --> 11:30.315
THERE'S ONLY ONE OF
EACH SPECIES LEFT.

11:30.315 --> 11:33.357
PROFESSOR, WHAT HAPPENS IF SHE
DOESN'T LAY HER EGGS TODAY?

11:33.561 --> 11:34.482
OOH, BOY.

11:34.746 --> 11:37.589
YOU CAN KISS THE GALLOPOLIS
TURTLELOPOLIS GOODBYE.

11:37.589 --> 11:39.368
WE'RE TALKING EXTINCT HERE.

11:39.931 --> 11:42.953
LOOK. HERE COMES
THE HAPPY MAMA NOW.

11:43.234 --> 11:46.340
THIS IS IT, THE MOMENT ALL
OF US HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR.

11:46.603 --> 11:50.192
THE LAST EXISTING SURVIVOR
OF THIS VANISHING SPECIES

11:50.192 --> 11:52.920
IS ABOUT TO LAY
HER EGGS.

11:54.792 --> 11:58.584
OH, BOY, THE TURTLE
IS IN THE SOUP NOW.

11:59.755 --> 12:02.532
OH, NO! SOMEONE
STOP THAT TRUCK!

12:04.091 --> 12:04.908
LET GO!

12:05.399 --> 12:07.147
THIS ISN'T
GARBAGE!

12:08.711 --> 12:10.283
APRIL, COME BACK.

12:10.627 --> 12:13.374
TURTLES, I'M

12:13.374 --> 12:15.961
I THINK IT'S HEADING FOR
THE RECYCLING CENTER.

12:16.290 --> 12:19.447
KEEP CALM, APRIL.
WE TURTLES WILL SAVE YOU.

12:23.559 --> 12:28.925
WHOA, ISN'T
THIS MUSIC EXCELLENT?

12:35.356 --> 12:36.992
HEY, LET GO OF US!

12:36.992 --> 12:38.494
I'M A MEMBER
OF THE PRESS,

12:38.494 --> 12:42.003
AND SHE'S A MEMBER
OF AN ENDANGERED SPECIES.

12:43.762 --> 12:46.260
FUNNY, YOU DON'T
LOOK LIKE A TURTLE.

12:46.679 --> 12:49.098
DUMP 1000,
WHAT'S GOING ON?

12:49.351 --> 12:50.908
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?

12:51.288 --> 12:55.156
I CAN'T HELP IT.
I'M ONLY FOLLOWING ORDERS.

12:55.508 --> 12:57.413
MY ORDERS, MS. O'NEILL.

12:57.837 --> 12:59.110
SHREDDER!

12:59.415 --> 13:00.462
NATURALLY.

13:00.462 --> 13:02.622
AND THIS TIME I'LL GET

13:02.622 --> 13:03.790
THOSE TURTLE FRIENDS
OF YOURS.

13:04.040 --> 13:05.291
I MIGHT HAVE KNOWN
YOU'D BE

13:05.291 --> 13:07.228
BEHIND THIS
DESPICABLE SCHEME.

13:07.723 --> 13:10.940
FLATTERY WILL GET YOU...
TIED UP.

13:12.294 --> 13:13.931
WHAT SHOULD
WE USE, BOSS--

13:14.307 --> 13:17.253
A GRANNY KNOT
OR A SHEEP SHANK?

13:17.535 --> 13:20.046
WHY NOT USE ONE
LIKE YOUR HEAD--

13:20.046 --> 13:21.860
A SQUARE KNOT?

13:23.885 --> 13:27.223
GET THIS THING OFF ME,
YOU AMOEBA BRAIN.

13:28.269 --> 13:29.896
WE GOT IT, BOSS.

13:30.208 --> 13:31.287
HANG ON.

13:33.472 --> 13:36.728
GET OFF OF ME,
YOU GREEN GEEK.

13:40.156 --> 13:46.338
LET GO. THAT'S MY LASER
BLASTER TRIGGER FINGER.

13:46.729 --> 13:48.791
DON'T SWEAT IT,
ROCK STEADY.

13:49.033 --> 13:50.657
I'LL GET HIM
OFF YOU.

13:54.124 --> 13:56.242
I HATE TURTLES!

13:57.396 --> 13:58.721
THIS MIGHT NOT
BE EASY.

13:58.975 --> 14:00.545
THAT PLACE
IS A FORTRESS.

14:00.811 --> 14:03.576
YEAH. WE MIGHT HAVE
TO BLAST OUR WAY IN.

14:03.838 --> 14:05.631
FORGET FIRE POWER.

14:05.853 --> 14:07.102
WE'LL USE THAT.

14:07.382 --> 14:08.571
YOU'RE TOO LATE, DONATELLO.

14:08.571 --> 14:10.578
ANOTHER SUPERHERO
ALREADY HOLDS

14:10.816 --> 14:12.375
THE PATENT ON
TELEPHONE BOOTHS.

14:12.639 --> 14:13.904
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

14:14.200 --> 14:16.835
THE CENTER IS RUN BY
A GIANT CENTRAL COMPUTER.

14:17.074 --> 14:20.442
I'M HOPING I CAN PATCH INTO
IT BY WAY OF THE PHONE LINE.

14:20.687 --> 14:23.155
ALL RIGHT!
THEN START WALKING,

14:23.155 --> 14:25.022
AND LET YOUR FINGERS
DO THE TALKING.

14:25.288 --> 14:26.944
HERE GOES, FELLAS.

14:28.675 --> 14:29.671
WHAT?

14:32.125 --> 14:33.244
IT'S GOT DONATELLO!

14:33.575 --> 14:34.856
WE MUST STOP IT!

14:37.050 --> 14:38.501
SO MUCH
FOR THAT IDEA.

14:38.817 --> 14:41.792
OH, NO, DUDES.
MAXIMUM BUMMER.

14:42.011 --> 14:44.415
WHAT A HORRIBLE
DEVELOPMENT.

14:45.151 --> 14:48.269
YEAH, BUT WHAT A
GREAT CLIFF HANGER!

14:56.234 --> 14:57.662
OPEN THESE DOORS.

14:57.662 --> 15:00.706
LET ME OUT,
OR I'LL CALL MY LAWYER.

15:01.111 --> 15:03.452
NO, YOU'LL BE CALLING,
ALL RIGHT...

15:03.700 --> 15:05.215
FOR MERCY.

15:10.384 --> 15:11.673
SO LONG, WIMP.

15:11.941 --> 15:13.545
BYE-BYE, BOZO.

15:14.172 --> 15:16.289
YOU'LL NEVER GET AWAY
WITH THIS, SHREDDER!

15:16.684 --> 15:18.929
AND WHO'S GOING
TO STOP ME--

15:19.147 --> 15:21.177
YOUR PRECIOUS
NINJA TURTLES?

15:21.453 --> 15:23.189
YOU'LL SEE!
THEY'LL COME CHARGING

15:23.389 --> 15:25.759
THROUGH THAT DOOR
ANY MINUTE NOW.

15:28.541 --> 15:30.270
WHY, YOU'RE RIGHT,
MS. O'NEILL.

15:30.486 --> 15:32.474
HERE'S ONE OF THEM NOW.

15:32.474 --> 15:34.327
DONATELLO,
WHAT HAPPENED?

15:34.807 --> 15:35.930
I'LL TELL YOU LATER.

15:35.930 --> 15:37.678
I DON'T WANT
TO TIE UP THE PHONE.

15:39.740 --> 15:41.952
KRANG, WE'VE GOT
ONE OF THE TURTLES.

15:42.273 --> 15:43.876
WHAT GOOD IS ONE?

15:44.093 --> 15:45.946
WE NEED ALL
4 OF THEM.

15:47.120 --> 15:48.067
DON'T YOU SEE?

15:48.067 --> 15:49.846
WHEN THE OTHERS COME
TO RESCUE THEIR FRIEND,

15:49.846 --> 15:51.718
THEY'LL BE
CAPTURED, TOO.

15:51.920 --> 15:54.498
AND THEN, WITH ALL THIS
MACHINERY AT MY COMMAND,

15:54.498 --> 15:57.037
I SHALL BE INVINCIBLE.

15:57.373 --> 15:58.475
WHAT A CORNBALL.

15:58.816 --> 16:01.079
WHO WRITES THAT GUY'S
DIALOGUE, ANYWAY?

16:01.281 --> 16:02.435
NEVER MIND SHREDDER!

16:02.731 --> 16:05.026
WE'VE GOT TO HELP
THAT POOR SEA TURTLE.

16:05.228 --> 16:06.787
IF SHE DOESN'T
RETURN TO THE BEACH

16:07.006 --> 16:08.268
TO LAY HER EGGS
BY HIGH TIDE,

16:08.522 --> 16:10.677
IT WILL BE THE END
OF HER SPECIES!

16:10.890 --> 16:12.186
LISTEN TO ME,
SHREDDER.

16:12.186 --> 16:14.681
THIS INSANITY HAS
GONE ON TOO LONG.

16:14.919 --> 16:16.539
IT HAS GOT
TO STOP!

16:16.867 --> 16:20.346
AND HE COMPLAINS ABOUT
SHREDDER'S CORNY DIALOGUE?

16:33.593 --> 16:34.232
WHAT--

16:34.232 --> 16:36.124
DOZENS OF HANDS
GRABBING AT US.

16:36.124 --> 16:38.773
WE WANT TO GET INSIDE,
BUT NOT THIS WAY!

16:39.272 --> 16:40.926
I'M COMING GUYS.
HANG ON.

16:42.254 --> 16:43.983
LIKE WE'VE GOT
A CHOICE, RIGHT?

16:45.716 --> 16:47.700
THERE, FELLAS.
YOU'RE FREE.

16:48.741 --> 16:52.595
THAT'S TERRIFIC. YOU CUT
OUR CLIMBING ROPES, TOO!

16:51.659 --> 16:53.097
NO!
NO!

16:56.730 --> 16:59.305
SORRY, GUYS.

17:02.196 --> 17:05.035
I AM

17:05.981 --> 17:08.760
LISTEN, I'VE GOT AN IDEA
HOW TO GET INTO THIS PLACE.

17:09.108 --> 17:11.742
UH-OH. I SMELL
DISGUISE COMING UP.

17:16.058 --> 17:18.353
PLEASE IDENTIFY
YOURSELVES.

17:18.742 --> 17:20.570
OH, WE'RE,
LIKE, UH...

17:20.865 --> 17:22.612
SANITATION INSPECTORS--

17:22.859 --> 17:26.900
YEAH, WE'RE HERE TO
CHECK THE PLACE OUT.

17:29.303 --> 17:31.132
YOU WILL GIVE
THE PASSWORD.

17:31.132 --> 17:34.205
PASSWORD? WE DON'T NEED
NO STINKING PASSWORD.

17:34.466 --> 17:37.060
STINKING IS
THE CORRECT WORD.

17:37.060 --> 17:38.837
YOU MAY ENTER.

17:39.099 --> 17:40.722
ALL RIGHT!
WAY TO GO, DUDE.

17:46.549 --> 17:49.294
I WONDER WHERE ALL
THOSE TURTLES ARE HEADED.

17:49.512 --> 17:51.465
THE SAME
PLACE YOU ARE.

17:52.684 --> 17:55.301
THAT'S WHAT YOU THINK,
BACON BREATH.

18:02.124 --> 18:04.801
THIS KIND OF
REMINDS ME OF OUR ROOM...

18:05.020 --> 18:06.990
ONLY NOT AS MESSY.

18:07.272 --> 18:11.140
WELL, IT'S ABOUT
TO GET MESSIER.

18:13.587 --> 18:14.957
NO!
NO!

18:26.318 --> 18:30.436
HMM, THOSE VOICES
SOUND AWFULLY FAMILIAR.

18:32.585 --> 18:35.164
BOSS, ARE WE GLAD
TO SEE YOU.

18:35.927 --> 18:39.051
PLEASE, BOSS,
HELP US OUT.

18:39.435 --> 18:40.593
WHAT'S YOUR HURRY?

18:40.593 --> 18:43.162
GARBAGE PICKUP ISN'T
TILL NEXT THURSDAY.

18:44.247 --> 18:47.269
I HAVE THIS STRANGE FEELING
THE TURTLES ARE NEARBY.

18:47.594 --> 18:49.328
I JUST HOPE
THEY'RE IN TIME

18:49.328 --> 18:51.384
TO HELP THIS POOR
SEA TURTLE!

18:53.416 --> 18:56.142
WE'VE GOT TO FIND
DONATELLO AND APRIL.

18:56.439 --> 18:58.481
TURTLES SIGHTED.
TURTLES SIGHTED.

18:59.015 --> 19:00.852
UH-OH, GUYS.
ON YOUR TOES

19:00.852 --> 19:02.477
FOR SOME
MORE HANDS.

19:02.771 --> 19:08.918

BUTT BRAINS!

19:11.762 --> 19:13.770
THANKS FOR BREAKING
OUR FALL, SHREDHEAD.

19:14.129 --> 19:16.796
DUMP 1000,

19:21.464 --> 19:22.880
BOY, ARE WE DUMB--

19:22.880 --> 19:25.938
WE FELL FOR THE OLD
TITANIUM TENTACLES

19:27.394 --> 19:28.144
IN THE CEILING BIT.

19:28.356 --> 19:29.931
OH, AT LAST I'VE WON!

19:30.152 --> 19:32.210
THE TURTLES ARE
MY PRISONERS!

19:34.193 --> 19:36.663
THANKS. NOW HIM.

19:39.447 --> 19:42.011
THANKS, FELLA--

19:43.722 --> 19:46.764
APRIL, HELP ME CLEAR THESE
TURTLES OFF THE COMPUTER

19:46.764 --> 19:48.325
SO I CAN REPROGRAM IT.

19:49.884 --> 19:51.132
OOH.
THIS ONE'S HEAVY.

19:52.833 --> 19:56.095
TALK ABOUT YOUR WEIRD
SPECIES OF TURTLE.

19:56.373 --> 19:57.218
HOLD IT.

19:57.425 --> 19:59.399
IT LOOKS LIKE SOME
SORT OF CONTROL DEVICE.

20:00.851 --> 20:02.366
AT LEAST IT
USED TO BE.

20:02.915 --> 20:04.626
AT LAST
I'M FREE.

20:04.909 --> 20:05.972
FREE.

20:06.483 --> 20:07.807
WHAT'S GOING ON?

20:09.790 --> 20:12.192
SEIZE THE SUPERVILLAIN.

20:12.506 --> 20:13.551
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

20:13.551 --> 20:16.127
I'M YOUR MASTER.
RELEASE ME AT ONCE!

20:16.420 --> 20:17.635
RELEASE YOU?

20:17.635 --> 20:20.304
WITH UTMOST
PLEASURE, MASTER.

20:21.123 --> 20:24.584
BEBOP, LET'S GET
OUT OF HERE!

20:24.584 --> 20:26.362
DON'T RUSH OFF,
GENTLEMEN.

20:33.115 --> 20:34.822
GREAT JOB, DONATELLO.

20:35.153 --> 20:37.686
YEAH, MONDO
MANEUVERING, MAN.

20:37.911 --> 20:40.376
THANKS, GUYS, BUT WE'VE
STILL GOT MORE WORK TO DO.

20:40.627 --> 20:43.043
THAT'S RIGHT, LIKE GETTING
THIS SEA TURTLE

20:43.043 --> 20:45.259
BACK TO THE BEACH
SO SHE CAN LAY HER EGGS.

20:45.462 --> 20:46.654
APRIL IS CORRECT.

20:46.654 --> 20:47.790
YOU MUST HURRY.

20:47.790 --> 20:49.587
I WILL RETURN
THE OTHER TURTLES

20:49.587 --> 20:51.045
TO THEIR PROPER HOMES.

20:56.818 --> 20:59.970
OH, LOOKS LIKE WE
MADE IT JUST IN TIME!

21:00.301 --> 21:01.498
GOODBYE!

21:01.781 --> 21:08.134
BYE-BYE!
LATER!

21:08.363 --> 21:10.968
MICHELANGELO,
I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

21:11.202 --> 21:12.480
YOU'RE ACTUALLY CRYING.

21:13.066 --> 21:16.817
I GUESS SHE KIND OF
REMINDS ME OF MY MOM.

21:16.817 --> 21:19.220
COME ON, I'LL BUY
YOU A PIZZA.

21:19.422 --> 21:20.788
THAT OUGHT TO
CHEER YOU UP.

21:21.059 --> 21:25.055
WHOA, PIZZA? OH,
WHOA, WILL IT EVER!

21:25.290 --> 21:27.105
COME ON,
LET'S GET GOING!

21:27.105 --> 21:29.049
WHERE ARE YOU
TAKING ME?

21:29.049 --> 21:31.347
BACK TO THE GARBAGE
RECYCLING CENTER.

21:31.347 --> 21:35.120
I SCOPED OUT SOME GREAT LEFTOVERS
WE COULD USE FOR TOPPINGS.

21:36.260 --> 21:38.627
NO WAY!
