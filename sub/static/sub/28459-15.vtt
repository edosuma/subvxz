34:56.734 --> 34:59.767

35:00.000 --> 35:02.166
very interesting
I found out today.

35:03.533 --> 35:07.700
My daughter Alexia's very close
friend was burglarized.

35:07.734 --> 35:10.100
And her house was under
construction

35:10.133 --> 35:11.700
when the burglary happened.

35:11.734 --> 35:15.467
So they took
the construction workers

35:15.500 --> 35:17.600
to have a lie detector test.

35:17.633 --> 35:19.767
Guess who was there

35:20.000 --> 35:23.100
taking a lie detector test.

35:23.133 --> 35:24.433
- Who?

35:26.066 --> 35:27.467
- Lisa.

35:29.233 --> 35:32.133
Lisa Vanderpump was there

35:32.166 --> 35:34.500
taking a lie detector test.

35:34.533 --> 35:36.166
- What?!

35:38.033 --> 35:40.233
I'm confused. Why...
- Why would she do that?

35:40.266 --> 35:42.600
- She's obviously
taking a lie detector test

35:42.633 --> 35:44.133
to say she's innocent
from whatever--

35:44.166 --> 35:45.133
she acts like she's being

35:45.166 --> 35:46.266
accused of murder,
for God sakes.

35:46.300 --> 35:48.033
- I know.
That's what I can't understand.

35:48.066 --> 35:50.100
- One, this is, like,
not even normal behavior.

35:50.133 --> 35:51.266
- Last time I saw her,

35:51.300 --> 35:53.033
Lisa Vanderpump talked about

35:53.066 --> 35:56.700
taking a lie detector test
to "clear her name."

35:56.734 --> 35:58.000
- What do you want me to do?

35:58.033 --> 35:59.300
You want me to take
a lie detector test?

35:59.333 --> 36:01.433
- No, I don't want you to take
a lie detector test.

36:01.467 --> 36:03.667
I did not expect this!

36:03.700 --> 36:07.166
- When she brought it up...
- That is crazy.

36:07.200 --> 36:10.567

at a lie detector test?

ask me these questions"?

36:19.200 --> 36:21.300

"did you give the story..."?

36:21.333 --> 36:23.734
- Did you give the story
to Radar Online?

36:23.767 --> 36:25.667
- Right.
- Do you know anyone

36:25.700 --> 36:27.166
that gave the story
to Radar Online?

36:27.200 --> 36:29.166
- Right. Those are the two
most important ones.

36:29.200 --> 36:32.567
- Lie detector tests
aren't even accurate.

36:32.600 --> 36:34.033
- No, I know.

36:34.066 --> 36:35.700
Innocent people fail them
all the time;

36:35.734 --> 36:36.700

It's stupid.

in court.

and everything.

36:56.767 --> 36:59.266
Why do you think she does it?

36:59.300 --> 37:02.100
- It's how she looks
to the world.

37:02.133 --> 37:04.300
She wants to be perceived
as perfect.

37:04.333 --> 37:06.066
