01:38.496 --> 01:39.498
Three more to go in our

01:39.531 --> 01:40.700
final qualifier tonight,

01:40.733 --> 01:42.535
and it's hidden taking control.

01:42.567 --> 01:44.436
Close behind is
Slegger and Williams,

01:44.469 --> 01:46.239
double wide and three and four,

01:46.272 --> 01:47.073
now all bunched up

01:47.105 --> 01:48.307
heading to the
front straight away.

01:53.179 --> 01:54.680
Side by side, rim to rim,

01:54.712 --> 01:56.348
takes a high line,
Bill needs to go slow.

02:04.256 --> 02:06.859
Slides into one and two.

02:09.728 --> 02:11.164
There's the white,
one more time,

02:11.197 --> 02:12.431
wants the future spot,

02:12.463 --> 02:13.633
so does Snider.

02:13.665 --> 02:15.501
Still, holding onto
the lead is Hinton.

02:15.533 --> 02:16.668
Here we go, here we go,

02:16.701 --> 02:18.871
back into the straight away.

02:20.973 --> 02:23.276
It's game on, and the
turns are leading.

02:23.308 --> 02:24.843
Now four, into the finish line.

02:24.877 --> 02:26.546
It's gonna be Hinton and Snider

02:26.579 --> 02:27.680
in tonight's feature,

02:27.712 --> 02:29.281
coming up next.

03:01.780 --> 03:04.449
<b>GEARHEADS</b>

03:06.525 --> 03:09.525
<b>Subrip: Pix</b>

03:21.967 --> 03:24.604
And here we go, it's race time.

03:24.637 --> 03:26.538
Powering in to an early
lead in tonight's feature

03:26.572 --> 03:27.939
is Walter,

03:27.973 --> 03:30.309
who got a another full house
here inside of our town.

03:30.342 --> 03:31.711
Thanks again for filling
up those bleachers

03:31.743 --> 03:33.413
every Friday night.

03:34.580 --> 03:35.848
Here comes Bobby Dunlap
Senior on the high line,

03:35.881 --> 03:37.782
into turn four, he
overtakes Walter,

03:37.816 --> 03:39.284
opening up some distance.

03:39.318 --> 03:41.921
Nobody hangs onto
a lead like Dunlap.

03:41.954 --> 03:45.358
He's in his rocking chair now.

03:46.292 --> 03:47.492
Still in second,

03:47.526 --> 03:48.527
it's Walter, double
wide out of turn four.

03:48.560 --> 03:50.295
We have Phillips and Baker.

03:50.329 --> 03:51.730
It's Bobby Dunlap Senior,

03:51.764 --> 03:53.700
made them all choke on
that red dust once again.

03:56.467 --> 03:58.503
He has his mechanic Lucas here.

03:58.537 --> 04:01.907
Been almost unbeatable since
18 and a half years ago.

04:01.939 --> 04:04.544
Seems nobody can build a car
like that, their car good.

04:12.383 --> 04:13.785
Running high now
down to the low line,

04:13.818 --> 04:16.353
old Bobby D's been turning
left and doing all right,

04:16.387 --> 04:18.290
so if he thinks there's
a groove way down there,

04:18.324 --> 04:19.492
maybe he's right.

04:28.766 --> 04:29.935
Two to go.

04:32.370 --> 04:34.306
What's going
on with the 55?

04:34.339 --> 04:35.507
He's spinning loose.

04:35.540 --> 04:37.377
Real loose.

04:40.678 --> 04:42.281
Does the steering
wheel even work?

04:43.482 --> 04:44.517
He out of control.

04:44.550 --> 04:46.286
Hit the brakes, Bobby.

04:48.920 --> 04:50.355
Get the fire trucks over there.

04:50.389 --> 04:52.458
Bobby!

05:03.668 --> 05:06.072
Bobby.

05:08.406 --> 05:09.875
Bobby Junior.

05:11.944 --> 05:13.946
I know you're down there.

05:33.132 --> 05:34.834
Deputy Clarke.

05:37.101 --> 05:38.471
Fishin'

05:40.439 --> 05:42.675
What do you say
we go for a ride?

05:47.146 --> 05:48.381
Look, Bobby.

05:48.413 --> 05:49.647
I told you before,

05:49.680 --> 05:50.815
if you missed another day

05:50.848 --> 05:53.752
the school is gonna
come down on you.

05:57.723 --> 05:59.391
I ain't goin'
to summer school.

06:01.560 --> 06:02.795
Well, I understand.

06:02.827 --> 06:05.497
But maybe a different learning
environment is what you need.

06:08.934 --> 06:10.536
It's called work study.

06:13.572 --> 06:15.441
Luke?

06:17.608 --> 06:19.512
There's no way man.

06:19.545 --> 06:20.713
There ain't no way.

06:20.745 --> 06:22.180
Bobby, Bobby.

06:22.213 --> 06:24.983
He's the only one who
even returned my call.

06:27.519 --> 06:29.555
It's eight bucks an hour.

06:42.600 --> 06:44.202
Don't tell those
global warmies.

06:44.235 --> 06:45.603
This baby burns a
full gallon of gas

06:45.637 --> 06:47.506
just turning over.

06:55.613 --> 06:57.215
Can I help you, sir?

06:57.249 --> 06:58.551
Sir?

06:58.584 --> 06:59.951
That's what I'm talkin' about.

07:00.952 --> 07:07.492
Is there any specials today?

07:12.630 --> 07:13.632
Hey.

07:17.668 --> 07:18.536
I was steaks today,

07:18.569 --> 07:20.572
and everybody picked
up their to goes.

07:22.940 --> 07:24.576
What do you call this?

07:25.677 --> 07:26.979
I call it free.

07:28.247 --> 07:30.216
Here.

07:30.249 --> 07:32.551
Put a bunch of mustard on it.

07:32.584 --> 07:34.920
Won't even taste
the burned parts.

07:34.952 --> 07:36.822
The burned parts?

08:06.718 --> 08:09.288
Look at that.

08:09.321 --> 08:10.689
Dude.

08:10.721 --> 08:12.757
That chick is
hillbilly white trash.

08:14.158 --> 08:15.728
I'm gonna make her mine.

08:17.696 --> 08:18.664
Ho ho.

08:19.564 --> 08:21.233
Check this out.

08:21.266 --> 08:22.701
Well if the whole trailer park

08:22.733 --> 08:24.269
didn't come down here today.

08:25.269 --> 08:26.805
So say hello?

08:28.639 --> 08:35.615
Let's tune him up.

08:58.003 --> 08:59.972
Another smart-ass t-shirt.

09:00.871 --> 09:03.174
Probably burns the flag too.

09:03.207 --> 09:05.144
Hey pal.

09:05.177 --> 09:07.046
Sorry about the whole eye thing.

09:07.078 --> 09:08.313
You know, I heard you
were talking all kinds

09:08.346 --> 09:11.716
of mess about me, so
I had to represent.

09:13.217 --> 09:14.620
So what?

09:14.653 --> 09:15.754
You all like, what?

09:15.787 --> 09:17.690
Straight up gangsters
or something?

09:17.722 --> 09:19.324
You know what?
That's it.

09:19.357 --> 09:22.627
Hey, hey hey.
Calm down, calm down.

09:22.660 --> 09:23.928
Listen, man.

09:23.961 --> 09:26.932
I came down here to
apologize to you.

09:26.965 --> 09:28.133
I just found out

09:28.166 --> 09:29.936
that you didn't even do it.

09:31.870 --> 09:34.673
I made the extra effort
to come and find you.

09:34.706 --> 09:36.274
I swear.

09:36.307 --> 09:38.744
What do ya say?

09:42.980 --> 09:45.350
See, was that so hard, man?

09:45.384 --> 09:47.052
Now listen, pal.

09:47.085 --> 09:49.922
You see that girl over there.

09:51.023 --> 09:52.591
Do you know her?

09:53.958 --> 09:56.060
Naw, I've never
seen her before.

09:56.094 --> 09:59.031
She's white trash,
just like you.

09:59.063 --> 10:00.632
Shut up, Dale.

10:00.666 --> 10:02.635
I'm trying to talk
to my friend here.

10:04.836 --> 10:07.873
So what's her deal?

10:08.840 --> 10:10.776
She got a name?

10:12.210 --> 10:14.780
Dude, you really
wanna know her name?

10:15.980 --> 10:18.350
Go read her name tag.

10:22.754 --> 10:24.856
You hear this guy?

10:26.692 --> 10:28.693
Listen up, buddy boy.

10:28.726 --> 10:29.894
That little shiner

10:29.927 --> 10:32.898
is nothing compared
to what's coming.

10:37.269 --> 10:40.272
I will own your ass.

10:50.347 --> 10:52.717
Nice seeing ya, fellas.

11:43.869 --> 11:45.437
It's just dancing,

11:45.470 --> 11:46.872
but with less clothes.

11:47.938 --> 11:49.774
Bobby, is that you?

11:53.245 --> 11:56.181
No, I'm not gonna tell you
this again, Jamie Monroe.

11:56.214 --> 11:58.317
What you do with your
body is your business,

11:58.350 --> 11:59.951
and I will never
judge you for it,

11:59.985 --> 12:02.721
but there is no way I
am ever gonna do that.

12:03.989 --> 12:06.057
Hold on one second.

12:06.091 --> 12:08.293
Come on, girl.
Don't be shy.

12:08.326 --> 12:09.927
Later.

12:09.961 --> 12:10.962
There's a
whole lot of money down here.

12:12.563 --> 12:14.199
More than you'll make
selling chickens.

12:15.866 --> 12:17.769
So when did you
say I can start?

12:43.961 --> 12:47.432
I hear they had to wake
you up off the bar last week.

12:48.500 --> 12:50.269
Must've been over served.

12:52.070 --> 12:53.506
I got a friend
coming in to work.

12:54.605 --> 12:56.107
I told you I could get somebody.

13:01.145 --> 13:02.980
You ain't drinkin' no more?

13:03.014 --> 13:05.150
Ain't drinkin' any less.

14:10.916 --> 14:12.350
School sent me over.

14:12.384 --> 14:14.385
Told me to give you that.

15:08.072 --> 15:10.107
All right.

15:10.140 --> 15:11.976
I need these parts.

15:12.009 --> 15:14.446
Tools are here,
parts go in there.

15:16.614 --> 15:19.685
Okay, but how
do I know what...

15:24.154 --> 15:25.624
All right then.

15:33.465 --> 15:35.033
Darling, you ready?

15:37.402 --> 15:39.071
Honey, don't do that.

15:39.104 --> 15:40.205
You'll ruin your makeup.

15:40.238 --> 15:41.240
Come on.

15:42.139 --> 15:44.009
It'll be fine.

15:44.042 --> 15:45.143
You're lookin' real hot.

15:45.176 --> 15:46.478
They'll love you.

15:48.046 --> 15:49.415
I don't know.

15:50.782 --> 15:53.352
I don't know if I
can do this, Jamie.

15:53.384 --> 15:55.086
Of course you can.

15:55.120 --> 15:57.655
Just smile and make
'em feel special.

16:00.258 --> 16:02.394
I gotta go work the floor
while they still love me.

16:04.662 --> 16:06.565
So hot.

16:07.465 --> 16:10.436
You're gonna make a ton of
cash of of them mill boys.

17:12.797 --> 17:14.465
Here you go, boys.

17:20.570 --> 17:22.339
Well, thank you, sweetheart.

17:22.373 --> 17:23.741
You're welcome.

17:25.242 --> 17:27.178
So why ain't you up there?

17:28.846 --> 17:33.317
Jeez.
Mind your manners, boy.

17:33.351 --> 17:35.087
Apologize to the lady now.

17:36.453 --> 17:38.089
That, that's all right.

17:38.123 --> 17:40.392
Someone's gotta keep
bringing the beers.

18:11.155 --> 18:13.125
Welcome
ladies and gentleman,

18:13.157 --> 18:15.459
and thank you for making
it down to the speedway.

18:15.492 --> 18:17.895
The cars are warm and
the drivers are ready.

18:17.929 --> 18:21.133
It's now time to get
onto our time trials.

18:21.165 --> 18:22.166
The last group is
coming off the track,

18:22.200 --> 18:24.536
and that's it for our hot laps.

18:24.568 --> 18:26.471
We have many generations
with us tonight,

18:26.503 --> 18:29.140
in the true tradition
of dirt track racing.

18:33.243 --> 18:34.211
Come on, Travis.

18:34.244 --> 18:36.180
We should leave her alone.

18:36.213 --> 18:38.182
She doesn't know what
she's missing out on.

18:39.217 --> 18:40.685
She should be serving me,

18:40.718 --> 18:43.855
not greasy burgers
and burnt toast.

18:46.257 --> 18:48.259
So that Dunlap,

18:48.292 --> 18:51.195
he's been working with that
whack job up at the junk yard.

18:54.231 --> 18:59.203
Is that right?

19:06.611 --> 19:09.248
So he didn't say a word?

19:10.914 --> 19:12.651
Barely two.

19:14.519 --> 19:16.521
Crazy drunk if you ask me.

19:26.330 --> 19:28.432
Bobby Junior, why
won't you talk to me?

19:32.869 --> 19:34.939
What do you want me to say?

19:48.252 --> 19:50.288
I gotta get to work.

19:53.290 --> 19:56.961
See ya.

20:00.865 --> 20:03.500
What are you doing
creeping around here?

20:03.534 --> 20:06.270
I say you here,
I figured I'd come say hey.

20:06.304 --> 20:07.706
Yeah?

20:07.739 --> 20:10.008
Yeah, just got a
new lift kit in my truck,

20:10.040 --> 20:11.475
and I thought maybe
you and I could

20:11.509 --> 20:13.377
go for a drive sometime.

20:13.411 --> 20:15.513
That is if you're single.

20:15.546 --> 20:17.282
I'll think about it.

20:19.951 --> 20:21.620
You think about it.

22:15.465 --> 22:17.935
And here
we go, it's race time.

22:17.969 --> 22:19.403
Powering into an early lead

22:19.436 --> 22:21.438
in tonight's feature is Walter.

22:21.471 --> 22:23.375
We've got another full
house here in Solder town.

22:23.407 --> 22:24.842
Thanks again for filling
up those bleachers

22:24.875 --> 22:26.778
every Friday night.

22:26.810 --> 22:28.879
Here comes Bobby Dunlap
Senior on the high line,

22:28.913 --> 22:31.048
into turn four, he
overtakes Walter,

22:31.082 --> 22:32.450
opening up some distance.

22:32.482 --> 22:35.552
Nobody hangs onto
a lead like Dunlap.

22:41.726 --> 22:44.062
He and his mechanic Lucas here,
he's been almost unbeatable

22:44.095 --> 22:46.431
since 18 years ago.

22:46.463 --> 22:51.635
Seems nobody can
build a car like that.

22:55.539 --> 22:57.808
Riding high, and now
bound to the low line,

22:57.842 --> 23:00.078
old Bobby D's been turning
left and doing all right,

23:00.111 --> 23:01.813
so if he thinks there's
a groove way down there,

23:01.846 --> 23:03.582
well, maybe he's right.

23:22.467 --> 23:24.536
Checkered flag!

23:24.568 --> 23:26.471
Really racking up
them points now.

23:26.503 --> 23:29.440
He's definitely in contention
for the Martin Cup once again.

23:52.529 --> 23:54.865
Okay, I'll see
you tomorrow night.

23:54.898 --> 23:57.033
Thanks, Higgy.

23:57.034 --> 23:58.003
Hey.

23:59.036 --> 24:00.505
You're doing a good job.

24:33.069 --> 24:37.040
I need 16 15 inch tires
with the rim separate.

24:37.074 --> 24:42.547
Okay.

24:46.683 --> 24:48.787
Do you got an impact
wrench or something?

24:51.788 --> 24:55.192
It's out of sorts.

24:59.596 --> 25:01.266
You've got to be joking.

26:53.877 --> 26:54.980
All right.

27:02.185 --> 27:03.788
Hey there, Daisy Duke.

27:06.323 --> 27:08.726
I got a big race tomorrow night.

27:08.759 --> 27:10.260
Yeah?

27:10.294 --> 27:14.232
Yeah, I think you
need to be there.

27:14.265 --> 27:15.667
Is that right?

27:16.733 --> 27:18.202
That's right.

27:22.173 --> 27:23.740
Caution
lights are down.

27:23.773 --> 27:25.809
Here we go, only three more
for the checkered flag.

27:25.843 --> 27:27.178
Tilman powers into the hotline.

27:27.211 --> 27:28.813
The number 27 won't let...

27:41.192 --> 27:43.394
Coming out of turn four, on
the front, straight away.

27:56.073 --> 27:57.041
There's the light.

27:57.074 --> 27:58.843
One more time.

27:59.777 --> 28:00.878
Tilman on back straight away,

28:00.911 --> 28:02.413
now in the final turn.

28:03.847 --> 28:05.082
Checkered flag!

28:05.115 --> 28:07.050
He's gonna beat Travis
Tilman in victory lane

28:07.084 --> 28:08.753
for the fifth time this summer.

28:08.786 --> 28:10.755
Really racking up
them points now.

28:10.788 --> 28:13.758
He's definitely in contention
for the Martin cup once again.

28:17.127 --> 28:18.795
What's up?

28:18.828 --> 28:21.798
Well, I'm gonna need you
to move them cars up there,

28:21.832 --> 28:23.201
to down there.

28:24.335 --> 28:25.769
Yeah, but...

28:25.803 --> 28:27.305
You'll figure it out.

29:19.824 --> 29:21.226
Lucas.

29:25.195 --> 29:27.964
Hey, Lucas.

29:34.971 --> 29:37.008
Lucas.

29:37.040 --> 29:38.809
Come on, man.

29:39.943 --> 29:41.945
I can't do this.

29:43.247 --> 29:44.783
I don't drive.

29:48.952 --> 29:50.954
Can't you just tow 'em?

32:37.253 --> 32:40.958
I will own your ass.

32:41.759 --> 32:44.161
Lucas.

32:44.193 --> 32:45.596
Come on, man.

32:47.030 --> 32:48.499
I can't do this.

32:50.334 --> 32:52.135
I don't drive.

33:06.049 --> 33:08.519
That Travis Tilman
sure doesn't like to lose.

33:08.551 --> 33:11.154
While other drivers may
not like his aggressive,

33:11.188 --> 33:12.456
sometimes dangerous style,

33:12.489 --> 33:15.125
he certainly knows how
to rack up the victories.

33:19.163 --> 33:21.164
Hey.

33:21.198 --> 33:22.432
You see me out there?

33:22.465 --> 33:23.700
I sure did.

33:25.836 --> 33:28.072
You see me win?

33:28.105 --> 33:29.507
I did.

33:29.539 --> 33:31.608
Should we go celebrate?

33:31.642 --> 33:33.177
Let's go.

34:27.197 --> 34:28.264
There you are.

34:28.297 --> 34:30.433
Here, hold this.

34:30.467 --> 34:31.802
What is this?

34:34.338 --> 34:36.172
See...

34:36.206 --> 34:39.210
Motion creates electricity.

34:39.242 --> 34:42.277
Electricity creates motion.

34:42.311 --> 34:46.317
And it all starts with
magnetism from the poles.

34:59.228 --> 35:02.599
It's all in there.

35:06.603 --> 35:08.239
Yeah, this
baby's a beaut.

35:08.271 --> 35:10.273
440, dual exhaust,
heated seats.

35:10.306 --> 35:12.175
Can't beat that with a bet.

35:12.909 --> 35:15.245
How's it run without nitrous?

35:16.914 --> 35:20.551
Inhalation, compression.

35:21.617 --> 35:24.322
Ignition, exhaust.

35:26.489 --> 35:28.192
Art.

35:29.860 --> 35:30.827
Pardon me.

35:32.228 --> 35:34.164
Mastery of hand.

35:34.197 --> 35:37.367
Confidence of stroke.

36:57.614 --> 36:59.317
What the?

37:13.429 --> 37:16.000
How can you stand so
close to those speakers?

37:17.068 --> 37:19.336
I said how can you
stand so close to those...

37:19.369 --> 37:21.372
It's the only way
to take it, buddy.

37:22.639 --> 37:24.474
Yeah, well, it
almost blew me over.

37:24.507 --> 37:26.409
Woo yes, sound
waves will do that.

37:26.443 --> 37:28.445
They push things around.

37:28.478 --> 37:30.681
And if you're looking
for maximum heavyocity...

37:35.351 --> 37:38.321
Damn, I ain't never heard
no car sound like that.

37:38.355 --> 37:40.456
Yeah, you can tune 'em
up, you can tune 'em down

37:40.489 --> 37:42.425
any which way.

37:42.458 --> 37:43.926
Just like a motor.

37:45.362 --> 37:46.931
Woo!

37:48.431 --> 37:50.000
Humbuckers and horse power,

37:50.032 --> 37:51.969
now that's what
I'm talking about.

37:53.503 --> 37:54.505
Woo.

37:55.472 --> 37:58.575
So what in the heck you
doin' here so early?

37:58.608 --> 37:59.977
It's two o'clock.

38:00.976 --> 38:02.846
What, in the afternoon?

38:04.981 --> 38:06.484
Man.

38:07.884 --> 38:10.487
I must've got
accidentally drunk.

38:11.521 --> 38:13.423
I'll put the coffee on.

38:19.396 --> 38:21.999
Yeah, it's Friday night.

38:22.032 --> 38:23.534
You ain't goin' nowhere

38:23.567 --> 38:26.003
'till that whole
paycheck is gone.

38:26.036 --> 38:27.871
Congratulations.

38:27.903 --> 38:29.739
New guy pays all night.

38:29.773 --> 38:31.709
Hell yeah, I'm
fixin' to get wilder

38:31.742 --> 38:33.911
than a filler goat
tonight, boys.

38:33.943 --> 38:35.478
Woo.

38:47.958 --> 38:49.927
Lucas.

38:51.494 --> 38:52.630
Higgy.

38:55.431 --> 38:57.367
New girl in town?

38:57.400 --> 38:59.369
Naw, it's Jamie's friend.

38:59.402 --> 39:00.737
Chill.

39:01.905 --> 39:03.607
Sick of the farm I guess.

39:03.639 --> 39:10.413
Another round?

39:14.617 --> 39:16.420
Save it for the dancers, sir.

39:18.454 --> 39:19.422
How 'bout a lap dance?

39:19.456 --> 39:20.691
Get off of me!

39:24.894 --> 39:27.097
Get out of here now.

39:45.181 --> 39:48.851
So, when did your sister start

39:48.885 --> 39:52.156
working at the strip club?

39:56.525 --> 39:58.928
What do you mean?

39:58.961 --> 40:01.465
You know it can get
pretty rough in there.

40:02.498 --> 40:03.833
What happened?

40:16.079 --> 40:19.083
What, are you gonna pick
her up on your handle bars?

40:53.516 --> 40:55.485
I'll meet you outside.

40:58.188 --> 40:59.523
Hey.

40:59.556 --> 41:01.492
Hey, you out of your mind?

41:01.525 --> 41:03.894
Bobby, what are
you doin' here?

41:03.927 --> 41:05.528
Yeah, I could ask
you the same thing.

41:06.996 --> 41:09.032
I work here.

41:13.603 --> 41:14.605
Are you all right?

41:25.681 --> 41:26.849
Since when are you driving?

41:26.882 --> 41:29.152
What are you doing
working at that place?

41:30.719 --> 41:32.722
You saw that sheriff's notice.

41:33.789 --> 41:34.824
We can't make that kind of money

41:34.858 --> 41:36.494
working at the corner store.

41:38.094 --> 41:40.097
Lucas told me what
happened tonight.

41:43.166 --> 41:45.001
Who were they?

41:47.704 --> 41:50.508
Bobby, I ain't strippin'
if that's what your thinkin'.

41:52.342 --> 41:54.512
I didn't need that
image in my head.

41:58.280 --> 41:59.750
Shut up.

42:02.351 --> 42:03.820
Look, I just...

42:05.121 --> 42:07.525
I just don't wanna
lose the house.

42:11.061 --> 42:12.930
Yeah, me neither.

42:16.599 --> 42:18.067
So you know Lucas?

42:19.969 --> 42:23.039
Yeah, he was Daddy's
mechanic and partner.

42:25.240 --> 42:26.976
Don't you remember?

42:28.911 --> 42:31.314
I was five when Dad died.

42:32.815 --> 42:36.018
He and Daddy would be
in that garage for hours,

42:36.052 --> 42:39.557
and their heads buried
under the hood of some car.

42:41.657 --> 42:44.661
He don't act like he knows me.

43:00.876 --> 43:02.612
Hey, you're back?

43:02.646 --> 43:04.114
Everything all right
with your sister?

43:04.981 --> 43:07.318
Hey now, you're gonna
damage the equipment.

43:08.652 --> 43:11.355
Did you have that machine

43:11.387 --> 43:14.625
hooked up to my Daddy's car?

43:17.661 --> 43:19.363
Is that how he died?

43:20.362 --> 43:22.165
Look, it's not
that simple, Bobby.

43:23.400 --> 43:24.835
Hey now.

43:24.867 --> 43:26.603
It's time I told ya.

43:27.336 --> 43:29.739
Now, that night
your Daddy and I,

43:29.773 --> 43:31.708
we were testing out a theory.

43:31.740 --> 43:35.144
Hey, but we lost control.

43:39.782 --> 43:40.784
Hey.

43:41.751 --> 43:42.719
You know what gets me?

43:42.751 --> 43:44.721
Is you never told me.

43:44.753 --> 43:46.155
You never said a damn word.

43:47.023 --> 43:49.727
Bobby, your Daddy
and I had a plan.

43:50.760 --> 43:52.663
We just didn't know
how far it would go.

43:53.762 --> 43:54.931
Bobby!

43:58.867 --> 44:01.270
My family
owns all of this.

44:04.873 --> 44:06.809
The lake looks
beautiful to me.

44:07.876 --> 44:09.079
So do you.

44:10.280 --> 44:11.782
Travis.

44:15.784 --> 44:17.086
C'mon, you know you want it.

44:18.922 --> 44:19.889
Travis.

44:20.989 --> 44:22.358
Travis, stop it.

44:23.726 --> 44:24.728
Travis stop it!

44:24.760 --> 44:25.929
Don't.

44:25.961 --> 44:27.130
Don't you wanna
be with a winner?

44:29.331 --> 44:30.900
Where are you goin'?

44:30.934 --> 44:35.739
Where are you goin', Mae?

47:07.422 --> 47:08.557
That night,
your Daddy and I,

47:08.590 --> 47:11.060
we were testing out a theory.

47:11.094 --> 47:13.297
We were manipulating
time and space.

47:14.664 --> 47:18.268
Hey, but we lost control.

47:24.974 --> 47:27.577
Is that how he died?

47:27.610 --> 47:30.012
Look, it's
not that simple, Bobby.

47:36.920 --> 47:38.655
Bobby Dunlap
Junior's car has left the track

47:38.688 --> 47:41.324
in a crash eerily similar to
the one that claimed the life

47:41.356 --> 47:43.360
of his father 12 years ago.

47:57.507 --> 47:59.476
We regret to inform you
that Bobby Dunlap Junior

47:59.509 --> 48:02.512
did not survive the crash.

48:14.456 --> 48:15.925
Bases loaded,
bottom of the ninth,

48:15.958 --> 48:18.261
two outs, here comes the pitch,

48:20.530 --> 48:22.999
he got all of that one.

48:23.032 --> 48:24.300
Home run, baby!

48:26.034 --> 48:28.203
That was awesome.

48:32.307 --> 48:33.242
Hey.

48:35.043 --> 48:36.545
Can I help you?

48:36.579 --> 48:38.048
Can we talk?

48:39.148 --> 48:40.284
Please.

48:52.661 --> 48:55.130
What do you got there?

48:55.164 --> 48:58.134
Travis, what are
you doing here?

48:58.166 --> 49:00.737
Why haven't you
been returning my calls?

49:00.769 --> 49:02.072
Don't you remember?

49:03.438 --> 49:05.207
Why you bringing that up?

49:05.240 --> 49:06.543
We need to talk.

49:13.248 --> 49:14.350
Are you okay?

49:14.384 --> 49:17.052
Ain't like hitting girls, is it?

49:20.123 --> 49:24.193
You picked the wrong day, man.

49:28.398 --> 49:31.501
Are you all right?

49:31.534 --> 49:34.269
I almost had him, you know.

49:34.302 --> 49:35.739
I saw that.

49:37.206 --> 49:40.210
Come on, let's go get some ice.

50:06.235 --> 50:07.437
You sure this is his place?

50:07.469 --> 50:09.571
Yeah, that's it right there.

50:09.605 --> 50:12.074
That redneck sucker
punched the wrong guy.

50:13.208 --> 50:15.044
Yeah, he got you good.

50:15.077 --> 50:16.612
Shut up, Dale.

50:16.646 --> 50:18.148
Help me find a way inside.

50:32.394 --> 50:34.663
Yo, this don't
look like his room.

50:34.697 --> 50:36.700
Might be his sister's.

50:57.619 --> 51:00.123
This might get
us a little profit.

51:00.155 --> 51:02.625
Maybe even a new
exhaust manifold.

51:06.394 --> 51:07.396
Bingo.

51:25.380 --> 51:31.654
They took it all.

51:36.324 --> 51:38.293
Bobby Junior.

51:38.327 --> 51:40.163
I heard what happened.

51:41.164 --> 51:43.700
Yeah, they took all the
money Michelle had saved.

51:43.733 --> 51:45.301
I know you're totally
against the idea

51:45.333 --> 51:46.469
of racing and everything,

51:46.501 --> 51:49.105
but, the prize is
10,000 dollars.

51:53.342 --> 51:55.912
It's worth a shot.

51:55.945 --> 51:57.580
This is what
it's all about, folks.

51:57.612 --> 51:59.882
Passing down the tradition
through your family

51:59.916 --> 52:01.217
and your good buddies.

52:01.250 --> 52:02.585
Dirt track racing
is real racing.

52:02.617 --> 52:05.855
Home grown, served up
right here at the speedway.

53:21.864 --> 53:23.567
Lucas.

53:28.036 --> 53:32.675
Hey Lucas.

53:37.280 --> 53:38.281
Lucas.

53:49.458 --> 53:50.527
Hey...

53:53.362 --> 53:54.697
About before...

53:57.766 --> 54:00.469
Me too.

54:04.806 --> 54:06.242
For everything, Bobby.

54:07.876 --> 54:12.949
Sorry.

54:17.452 --> 54:18.822
Beautiful.

54:19.688 --> 54:25.761
This place in the morning.

54:30.398 --> 54:31.900
Hey Lucas...

54:35.771 --> 54:38.341
Can you do me a favor?

54:42.545 --> 54:44.847
Can you teach me how to race?

54:48.384 --> 54:51.420
I've been waitin'
for you to ask.

55:05.501 --> 55:06.936
You ready?

55:08.704 --> 55:12.642
Now, until you crash
or hit the wall,

55:12.675 --> 55:15.979
a man never truly
understands racin'.

55:17.380 --> 55:19.916
A good driver has
concern for the wall,

55:19.949 --> 55:21.918
but he pushes past it.

55:22.751 --> 55:27.523
A complete racer has
respect, but no fear.

55:31.092 --> 55:32.861
All right.

55:32.894 --> 55:36.032
Good talk.

55:52.981 --> 55:56.518
Hell, we got all day.

56:27.949 --> 56:29.485
That dog will hunt.

57:04.619 --> 57:06.822
Pretty sight, ain't it?

57:08.724 --> 57:12.195
Yeah, Lucas, this
may sound crazy, but,

57:14.262 --> 57:16.465
I swear I can hear music.

57:18.199 --> 57:20.669
You feel it right down
to the bone, don't ya?

57:22.670 --> 57:24.840
The rhythm of them cylinders,

57:24.873 --> 57:26.842
it's like a symphony.

57:29.677 --> 57:33.048
When you start driving with
your ears, not just your eyes,

57:34.115 --> 57:37.619
you begin to understand
what you're doing here,

57:37.652 --> 57:40.522
what you're all about.

57:44.293 --> 57:45.695
Took your Daddy a
lot longer than that

57:45.728 --> 57:48.998
to hear that orchestra play.

58:05.780 --> 58:08.550
All right, watch out
for snakes and spiders.

58:10.619 --> 58:12.622
It's like your
Daddy used to say,

58:12.655 --> 58:14.557
if you're not doing something
with what you learn,

58:14.590 --> 58:16.925
you ain't worth a damn.

58:20.896 --> 58:22.664
It's your Daddy's old backup.

58:25.701 --> 58:28.505
I reckon he'd want
you to have it.

58:31.739 --> 58:35.978
Damn, I don't
know what to say.

59:12.914 --> 59:14.284
Hey Michelle.

59:15.951 --> 59:17.786
Looks like I got a ride.

59:17.820 --> 59:19.588
Do you know this guy?

59:19.621 --> 59:21.757
Yeah, that's my brother.

59:21.789 --> 59:23.692
He's a cutie ain't he?

59:23.726 --> 59:25.827
Don't even think about it.

59:25.860 --> 59:26.962
Okay, okay.

59:29.231 --> 59:31.267
See you tomorrow.

59:48.150 --> 59:49.818
Yeah,
this is the place.

01:00:27.755 --> 01:00:31.226
Eenie meenie miney, hose.

01:00:48.242 --> 01:00:49.846
My goodness.

01:00:51.480 --> 01:00:52.882
What happened?

01:00:54.449 --> 01:00:57.952
Well, I stepped out.

01:00:57.985 --> 01:01:00.722
Lucas, what
happened to the car?

01:01:02.123 --> 01:01:04.393
Somebody broke in.

01:01:05.994 --> 01:01:08.364
They sure knew what
they were doin'.

01:01:09.831 --> 01:01:11.768
Why would anybody
wanna do this?

01:01:14.503 --> 01:01:16.239
Bad ethics.

01:01:18.106 --> 01:01:19.809
Can we fix it?

01:01:20.409 --> 01:01:24.146
Whoever it was, wasn't just
trying to mess up the paint.

01:01:24.179 --> 01:01:26.749
The race is in
less than a week.

01:01:28.282 --> 01:01:30.853
Well, that doesn't give
us much time now, does it?

01:01:34.356 --> 01:01:36.359
Hey, hand me that
wrench, would ya?

01:01:48.336 --> 01:01:49.338
Lucas.

01:01:49.972 --> 01:01:51.140
Yeah?

01:01:52.775 --> 01:01:54.376
What if I don't win?

01:01:55.911 --> 01:01:58.012
Well...

01:01:58.045 --> 01:01:59.715
You never know.

01:02:03.485 --> 01:02:06.189
I mean, you've
seen me out there.

01:02:07.889 --> 01:02:09.190
I ain't the fastest,

01:02:09.224 --> 01:02:12.461
and I definitely ain't
the most experienced.

01:02:13.862 --> 01:02:16.999
Well, none of that
is gonna matter none.

01:02:18.367 --> 01:02:20.369
You mean none of
that's gonna matter.

01:02:20.402 --> 01:02:22.371
Well, you got somethin'
none of them got.

01:02:24.539 --> 01:02:25.641
Like what?

01:02:25.675 --> 01:02:29.778
You're gonna say I have
heart or spirit or something.

01:02:29.811 --> 01:02:31.346
No, more important.

01:02:32.347 --> 01:02:34.483
You got your Daddy's blood,

01:02:34.516 --> 01:02:37.052
and I swear that
man had motor oil

01:02:37.085 --> 01:02:39.021
coursin' through his veins.

01:02:41.389 --> 01:02:43.192
What if that ain't enough?

01:02:44.358 --> 01:02:48.364
Well, it's what you got.

01:04:13.916 --> 01:04:18.387
You're not gonna do
something to the car, are you?

01:04:22.324 --> 01:04:24.427
You don't have to
worry about any of this.

01:04:25.494 --> 01:04:28.530
You just keep your
wheels on the track.

01:04:32.967 --> 01:04:35.070
This is my path.

01:05:16.210 --> 01:05:17.979
Ain't this excitin'?

01:05:19.547 --> 01:05:23.018
Welcome to the show.

01:05:27.621 --> 01:05:30.960
Yep.

01:05:35.097 --> 01:05:36.999
The rumors are true.

01:05:37.032 --> 01:05:38.401
You're paintin' again.

01:05:42.070 --> 01:05:44.006
Where are you off to?

01:05:44.039 --> 01:05:44.974
I was gonna see Bobby,

01:05:45.007 --> 01:05:49.043
see if Bobby needed
help with his project.

01:05:49.077 --> 01:05:50.947
I thought he was
finished with that.

01:05:52.280 --> 01:05:56.152
Hopefully today he will be.

01:06:00.422 --> 01:06:01.623
Where's Bobby?

01:06:01.655 --> 01:06:03.726
He got called up
for his time trials.

01:06:05.027 --> 01:06:06.996
Should be finishing
up about now.

01:06:07.028 --> 01:06:07.996
I missed it?

01:06:08.864 --> 01:06:10.432
Yeah, he got bumped
up on the list.

01:06:11.800 --> 01:06:17.440
Wait, here he comes.

01:06:21.643 --> 01:06:23.612
Well, how'd you do?

01:06:28.083 --> 01:06:29.751
Made the cut.

01:06:29.784 --> 01:06:31.452
That's great.

01:06:31.485 --> 01:06:33.054
How'd Tilman do?

01:06:34.088 --> 01:06:35.190
He's up now.

01:06:37.224 --> 01:06:39.060
Well, don't worry about him.

01:06:41.096 --> 01:06:43.164
You'll see him soon enough.

01:06:46.467 --> 01:06:48.503
Don't forget to
come on down to the midway.

01:06:48.536 --> 01:06:49.637
Under the bleachers,

01:06:49.670 --> 01:06:51.205
you get your racing
gear, good food,

01:06:51.239 --> 01:06:53.208
and an ice cold drink.

01:06:53.240 --> 01:06:55.344
Lots of flavors not be missed...

01:06:58.346 --> 01:07:00.282
Careful now.

01:07:00.315 --> 01:07:02.251
Don't wanna over tighten it.

01:07:02.284 --> 01:07:03.285
It seemed like it
was running a bit,

01:07:03.318 --> 01:07:05.421
retching the heat.

01:07:05.454 --> 01:07:07.589
Yeah, that oughta do it.

01:07:07.621 --> 01:07:09.157
Now start 'up.

01:07:20.402 --> 01:07:21.637
Right on pitch!

01:07:22.570 --> 01:07:25.273
You should really pull
out of those turns now.

01:07:34.882 --> 01:07:37.118
You come a long way,

01:07:38.385 --> 01:07:39.422
and

01:07:41.822 --> 01:07:44.393
I'm proud of ya.

01:07:44.425 --> 01:07:45.827
Thanks, Luke.

01:07:47.461 --> 01:07:48.730
Yeah, well...

01:07:50.164 --> 01:07:52.768
Check them tires, I'm
gonna go grab a beer.

01:07:56.170 --> 01:07:57.306
And
by the way, folks,

01:07:57.338 --> 01:07:58.606
don't forget to
stop by the Via W,

01:07:58.639 --> 01:08:00.108
women's auxiliary bake sale

01:08:00.141 --> 01:08:01.509
by the concession stand.

01:08:01.543 --> 01:08:02.878
They're selling
mouth-watering cheery,

01:08:02.911 --> 01:08:03.846
and apple crumble pies

01:08:03.878 --> 01:08:06.214
made from scratch and
ready for the table.

01:08:06.248 --> 01:08:09.485
All proceeds go to disabled
veterans in the local VA.

01:08:09.518 --> 01:08:11.320
This is a great cause
run by some great ladies,

01:08:11.353 --> 01:08:13.255
so let's get out there
and show your support

01:08:13.288 --> 01:08:14.121
for the veterans.

01:08:14.155 --> 01:08:16.256
God bless ya, and
God bless America.

01:08:17.225 --> 01:08:19.694
Knock 'em dead, Bobby Junior.

01:08:19.728 --> 01:08:20.796
I will.

01:08:21.895 --> 01:08:23.099
Thanks, Mae.

01:08:25.332 --> 01:08:27.135
For everything, I mean,

01:08:27.167 --> 01:08:28.470
you've been amazing.

01:08:30.270 --> 01:08:31.474
I'm just happy I could help.

01:08:34.242 --> 01:08:36.212
Racers,
please lead your cars...

01:08:37.444 --> 01:08:39.279
I gotta...

01:08:39.314 --> 01:08:40.483
You'll do great.

01:08:42.783 --> 01:08:43.783
All right, drivers.

01:08:43.818 --> 01:08:45.787
This'll be a 25 lap race.

01:08:45.819 --> 01:08:48.590
The first one to cross
the finish line wins.

01:08:48.622 --> 01:08:50.424
We'll be running in
Durrow rules tonight boys.

01:08:50.457 --> 01:08:52.560
That means nothing stops
unless you flip over

01:08:52.594 --> 01:08:54.229
or catch on fire.

01:08:54.261 --> 01:08:55.898
At that point, a yellow
flag will come out,

01:08:55.930 --> 01:08:57.599
a truck will push
you off the track.

01:08:58.934 --> 01:09:00.769
Prize tonight's 10,000.

01:09:00.801 --> 01:09:02.837
Let's have a good race, boys.

01:09:13.715 --> 01:09:15.417
You picked the
wrong horse, Mae.

01:09:16.318 --> 01:09:18.854
I don't know what
you're talking about.

01:09:18.886 --> 01:09:21.756
The kid's a natural.

01:09:22.823 --> 01:09:24.192
What'd he say?

01:11:06.060 --> 01:11:07.762
Here we go, the
big race final.

01:11:10.532 --> 01:11:12.601
Three time champion of
this 10,000 dollar race.

01:11:12.634 --> 01:11:13.502
He always

01:11:15.470 --> 01:11:17.338
And get this, driving
in the 55 car,

01:11:17.372 --> 01:11:19.408
is newcomer, Bobby
Dunlap Junior.

01:11:25.012 --> 01:11:26.347
Dunlap looks past the past,

01:11:26.381 --> 01:11:28.284
but doesn't

01:11:30.118 --> 01:11:32.087
Bobby Junior is the son
of the great track legend,

01:11:32.119 --> 01:11:33.755
Bobby Dunlap Senior,

01:11:33.787 --> 01:11:34.922
and just as surprising,

01:11:34.956 --> 01:11:36.525
seeing his old equipment
man, Lucas, here,

01:11:36.557 --> 01:11:38.359
who seems to have
come out of retirement

01:11:38.393 --> 01:11:40.095
to get behind this young racer.

01:11:40.127 --> 01:11:41.063
Good luck, Bobby Junior,

01:11:41.095 --> 01:11:42.797
you're certainly gonna need it.

01:11:42.831 --> 01:11:44.032
Racing may be Bobby Junior's...

01:11:45.533 --> 01:11:46.935
This is the first time
we see what this kid has

01:11:46.967 --> 01:11:49.305
what it takes to capture
the checkered flag.

01:12:03.484 --> 01:12:05.119
Tilman's trying to
pick up the final lead

01:12:05.153 --> 01:12:06.922
for the Martin Cup.

01:12:06.954 --> 01:12:08.090
Here we go.

01:12:08.122 --> 01:12:09.657
Turn green, turn
force into a file.

01:12:11.792 --> 01:12:13.362
Up to the high line.

01:12:13.395 --> 01:12:14.696
Dunlap, he's gonna
take the low line,

01:12:14.729 --> 01:12:16.731
turning one and two.

01:12:16.765 --> 01:12:18.367
He's gonna power away now.

01:12:18.399 --> 01:12:20.469
Tilman, he's gonna try to
build up some momentum.

01:12:20.502 --> 01:12:22.938
He's been on the high
line to make 'em up.

01:12:28.443 --> 01:12:30.612
Bobby Dunlap Junior has made
his way through the path,

01:12:30.645 --> 01:12:32.881
he's maneuvered
into second place.

01:12:32.913 --> 01:12:35.082
Challenging Tillman, we've
got lots of decent showman

01:12:35.115 --> 01:12:36.585
going on right now.

01:12:37.786 --> 01:12:41.056
These drivers want that 10,000
dollars something fierce.

01:12:44.591 --> 01:12:46.827
Travis Tilman and Bobby Junior
battling it out man to man,

01:12:46.860 --> 01:12:48.095
machine to machine,

01:12:48.128 --> 01:12:49.730
this could come down
to the final stretch.

01:12:49.764 --> 01:12:51.400
He turns one and two,

01:12:51.432 --> 01:12:53.068
Dunlap looks to make
a move down low,

01:12:53.100 --> 01:12:55.569
slips underneath
into three and four.

01:12:55.603 --> 01:12:57.572
If he flunks it, he's gonna
have to take it from Tilman,

01:12:57.604 --> 01:12:59.106
who's trying going on.

01:12:59.140 --> 01:13:00.876
The back, straight away,
making a run for it.

01:13:00.908 --> 01:13:03.677
White flag, one more
time, it's game on now.

01:13:03.711 --> 01:13:04.945
It's Tilman and Dunlap.

01:13:04.979 --> 01:13:06.515
Tilman gonna take the high line,

01:13:06.547 --> 01:13:07.748
Bobby Junior's gonna
take the low line

01:13:07.782 --> 01:13:10.152
into three and four.

01:13:32.073 --> 01:13:33.575
He slams the door on Tilman.

01:13:33.608 --> 01:13:35.644
Here we go, it's
Tilman and Dunlap.

01:13:35.676 --> 01:13:37.578
Dunlap powers into
a lead out of four,

01:13:37.612 --> 01:13:39.815
now on the front, straight
away, it's Dunlap.

01:13:39.847 --> 01:13:41.115
Dunlap for the win,
and Bobby Junior

01:13:41.149 --> 01:13:45.020
takes the checkered flag.

01:13:48.957 --> 01:13:50.525
And the Dunlap legacy
has been passed on

01:13:50.557 --> 01:13:52.493
to the next generation.

01:14:08.542 --> 01:14:15.483
Bobby Junior, we'll see
you in victory lane.

01:14:30.832 --> 01:14:31.900
Michelle!

01:14:31.932 --> 01:14:33.601
Woo!

01:14:33.635 --> 01:14:35.971
Woo!

01:14:40.307 --> 01:14:41.609
Thank you, thank you.

01:14:43.077 --> 01:14:44.213
Woo!

01:14:47.582 --> 01:14:48.917
Thanks.

01:14:52.220 --> 01:14:53.222
Man.

01:14:54.255 --> 01:14:55.556
Yeah.

01:15:37.832 --> 01:15:40.001
Bobby,

01:15:40.033 --> 01:15:42.570
It's clear to me that
you are exactly the man

01:15:42.604 --> 01:15:44.306
your father would
have wanted you to be.

01:15:47.307 --> 01:15:49.610
Your Daddy would be proud,

01:15:49.644 --> 01:15:51.713
just like I am.

01:15:53.146 --> 01:15:55.617
Enclosed is the key to the shop.

01:15:56.650 --> 01:15:59.086
You'll find the title and
other paperwork laid out

01:15:59.119 --> 01:16:00.689
on the desk.

01:16:00.721 --> 01:16:02.657
It's yours now.

01:16:04.091 --> 01:16:06.360
I got some traveling to do.

01:16:06.394 --> 01:16:09.731
A journey that you've
helped me to brave.

01:16:11.632 --> 01:16:14.668
'Cause the truth is, well,

01:16:14.702 --> 01:16:18.640
the truth is different
for each man, ain't it?

01:16:19.640 --> 01:16:21.876
But I reckon maybe that's
what we do on this earth.

01:16:23.310 --> 01:16:27.815
We search for truth, and
if we're lucky, we find it

01:16:27.849 --> 01:16:31.886
in who we are, and what we do.

01:16:35.355 --> 01:16:37.592
I was fortunate to meet
you and your Daddy.

01:16:40.194 --> 01:16:43.198
If I see him first, well,

01:16:43.230 --> 01:16:45.900
I'll be sure to say hello.

01:16:48.101 --> 01:16:49.770
Good luck to you, Bobby.

01:16:50.738 --> 01:16:53.208
Your friend, Lucas.
