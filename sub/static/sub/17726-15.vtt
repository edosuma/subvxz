"Vanderpump Rules"...

00:04.338 --> 00:05.106
- We can talk about
the bachelorette party.

00:06.174 --> 00:07.007
I feel like it would be really
fun to do New Orleans.

00:07.908 --> 00:08.342
I'll know exactly
where to take you guys.

- I'm gonna have a f---ing
awesome groomsmen squad.

00:11.612 --> 00:13.514
- Where do you want me to go?
- Wherever we go.

00:13.547 --> 00:16.284
- I did take what I had for
granted and I f---ed it up.

00:16.317 --> 00:20.054
- You were an arrogant
little punk.

00:20.088 --> 00:21.655
- She drinks,
and then she's mean,

00:21.689 --> 00:23.557
and sends me all of these
mean messages

00:23.591 --> 00:25.193
only when she drinks.

00:26.360 --> 00:27.161
- A lot of people feel that
you're fake a lot of times, so--

00:28.296 --> 00:29.297
- Then why the f--- are you
friends with me if I'm fake?

00:30.398 --> 00:31.299
- I don't agree with what Lala
said, but honestly,

00:32.133 --> 00:32.700
I'm not gonna sit here
and f---ing

00:33.567 --> 00:34.835
lay down in front of a truck

00:34.868 --> 00:36.670
because of some dumb sh--
she said.

00:36.704 --> 00:39.140
- Lala, who you've known for
about five f---ing minutes,

00:39.173 --> 00:40.841
and you've known--you've known
me for how long?

00:40.874 --> 00:42.543
- You've said stuff about her
too, though.

00:42.576 --> 00:44.345
- Really?

00:44.378 --> 00:47.448
I did not ask Ariana to be a
bridesmaid for a f---ing reason.

00:47.481 --> 00:50.551
She is a self-entitled,

00:50.584 --> 00:53.287
elitist, like, stuck-up person.

00:53.321 --> 00:54.688
- It's called being
emotionally mature.

00:54.722 --> 00:56.857
- All right.
- Are you drunk?

00:56.890 --> 01:00.261
Dude, I cannot believe you're
doing this to me right now.

It's so hot outside.
- I know.

01:41.369 --> 01:43.471
And guess what?
It's about to get even hotter.

01:43.504 --> 01:45.706
- Like, more humid.
- Yeah. Humid.

01:45.739 --> 01:47.308
- Are you bringing any heels?

01:47.341 --> 01:49.543
- I'm probably gonna bring
one pair of heels.

But, um, I feel stressed.

I swear to God, I feel like
it's my f---ing wedding,

'cause I feel stressed that
things aren't gonna be fun,

01:57.651 --> 01:59.587
or, like, is the bachelorette
party gonna be good.

01:59.620 --> 02:01.322

so disappointed

02:01.355 --> 02:02.356

that I choose.

02:02.390 --> 02:04.258
I mean, it was really hard,
like,

02:04.292 --> 02:06.160
I didn't have Katie
as a friend for a year

02:06.194 --> 02:08.196
because I kind of f---ed up.

02:08.229 --> 02:09.697
It's so much pressure.
I have nightmares

02:09.730 --> 02:11.499
about Katie being
disappointed in me.

02:11.532 --> 02:12.933
- Yeah.
- And now, basically,

02:12.966 --> 02:14.335
I'm in charge to make sure

02:15.469 --> 02:16.504
Katie has the best
bachelorette party ever.

02:17.571 --> 02:19.640
This is a chance for me
to do things differently.

02:19.673 --> 02:22.610
Better.
I haven't worn this shirt yet.

02:22.643 --> 02:24.345
It's so cute.
- That's super cute.

02:24.378 --> 02:26.380
It's fun and flirty,
just like you.

02:26.414 --> 02:28.182
- But I'm not flirty.
- But you have to, like,

02:28.216 --> 02:29.617
stop convincing yourself
that you're not.

02:29.650 --> 02:31.619
- I feel like I'm kind of,
like, negative.

02:31.652 --> 02:33.621
And abrasive.
- Stop being negative.

02:33.654 --> 02:35.289
I really just want her
to find someone

02:35.323 --> 02:37.225
to tell her she's pretty
and make out with her

02:37.258 --> 02:39.727
so she will stop f---ing crying
about Patrick.

02:39.760 --> 02:43.231
- I had one experience on
a vacation trying to be single.

02:43.264 --> 02:44.332
- Montauk was--
- Yes!

02:44.365 --> 02:45.533

02:45.566 --> 02:48.236
"This is what I have
coming for me?"

02:48.269 --> 02:50.604
- I've never hung out with
someone in--in a hot tub

02:50.638 --> 02:52.340
with a turtleneck on.

02:52.373 --> 02:55.409
It's like Steve Jobs.

02:55.443 --> 02:58.579
- Don't you think I would love
to meet somebody

02:58.612 --> 03:01.415
and then it makes me not think
about Patrick ever again?

03:01.449 --> 03:03.551
- This is your f---ing problem
and you know this.

03:03.584 --> 03:05.519
He is the first person who
has not given you

03:05.553 --> 03:08.722
a cheating, piece of sh-- reason
to break up with him,

03:08.756 --> 03:11.759
but he was a bad boyfriend.

just being like,

03:13.461 --> 03:14.528
"Your boyfriend's an asshole.

03:14.562 --> 03:15.996
He does awful things to you."

Like, that's how all the
relationships that I've been in.

03:18.466 --> 03:22.736
- I did go to Vegas and have
relations with someone else.

- I'm trying
to learn my lesson.

It's f---ing sad.
It's really sad.

03:27.841 --> 03:30.711
- You do deserve someone that
you're excited to be around

03:30.744 --> 03:33.714
all the time and not something
so wishy-washy.

03:33.747 --> 03:35.416

- Don't cry.

03:35.449 --> 03:36.717
- I'm depressed now.

03:36.750 --> 03:39.320
I don't want to talk
about anything now.

03:39.353 --> 03:41.422
I just don't!
- Don't get in your head.

03:41.455 --> 03:43.657
- It just puts me in that
f---ing depressed head space,

03:43.691 --> 03:45.759
and then all of a sudden
I have--it's my psoriasis.

03:45.793 --> 03:47.328
- Yeah, I know.

03:47.361 --> 03:49.330
- I know. I know. I know.

03:49.363 --> 03:50.531
- Ah!

03:51.799 --> 03:53.501

03:55.903 --> 03:59.239
I really hope that
that's gonna help.

you to take me

04:02.643 --> 04:05.346
to New Orleans for like, f---ing
five, six years.

You guys good?

04:26.667 --> 04:29.637
Just what I said yesterday,
like, I know I was, like,

04:29.670 --> 04:32.440
it's hard because--
I knew that was gonna happen.

04:32.473 --> 04:33.874
- I'm sorry about that, guys.
Yeah, I just--

04:33.907 --> 04:36.677

go at the same time...

04:36.710 --> 04:39.380
- [laughs]
- This whole building.

04:39.413 --> 04:43.517
- Come on, now. There we go.

04:45.486 --> 04:47.321
- [laughing]

04:47.355 --> 04:48.656
- So you know what that picture
you have on this--

04:48.689 --> 04:49.590
on your wall over there?
- Yeah.

04:50.724 --> 04:51.425
- I have that same picture
on my desk at work.

04:52.360 --> 04:53.794
- Really? It's a good one.
- You and Raven.

04:53.827 --> 04:55.663
- Mm-hmm.
My mom lives in Florida,

04:55.696 --> 04:57.765
so I really only get
to see my mom

04:57.798 --> 04:59.800
maybe once or twice a year.

04:59.833 --> 05:02.570
Not only did I get my love of
horses from her,

05:02.603 --> 05:06.674
but I like to think I inherited
her quiet strength.

05:06.707 --> 05:09.543
Except I'm not
always that quiet.

05:09.577 --> 05:10.878
- We're going over
to Scheana's later?

05:10.911 --> 05:12.813
- Scheana's mom's house.
- I'm just a little worried

05:12.846 --> 05:15.783
because Schwartz and Katie
had dinner last night,

05:15.816 --> 05:17.918
and got into it about us.

05:17.951 --> 05:20.588
Katie actually texted us
kind of mean stuff.

05:20.621 --> 05:22.356
- She did?
- Yeah.

05:22.390 --> 05:24.892
- She said, "I'm tired of
fighting and defending myself

05:24.925 --> 05:26.727
"against y'all with my fiancÃ©.

05:26.760 --> 05:28.796
"Jesus Christ.
Get over yourselves.

"We fight solely about him
defending the two of you.

05:31.932 --> 05:33.501
I'm very over it."

05:33.534 --> 05:35.536
The only thing I've said
about her lately

05:35.569 --> 05:37.505
is that she'd mad all the time.

05:37.538 --> 05:39.473
And I don't know if it's just
'cause she's stressed out

05:39.507 --> 05:40.340
about planning her wedding.

05:40.374 --> 05:42.142
I mean, it's coming
up really fast.

06:01.662 --> 06:03.431
Just trying to get everything
ready for tonight.

06:03.464 --> 06:04.732
- Yeah, so what's
happening tonight?

06:04.765 --> 06:05.733
- They bought out
the whole venue.

06:05.766 --> 06:06.800
- Okay.
- All night long.

06:07.768 --> 06:09.537
- All right, then, yeah, so...

06:09.570 --> 06:12.406

that was somebody--I was--

06:12.440 --> 06:13.641
I didn't realize it was you.

06:13.674 --> 06:14.875
I was really excited
for a second.

06:14.908 --> 06:17.511
- How are you?
You know James is DJing tonight.

06:17.545 --> 06:20.013
- Oh, yeah, but that's not at
our invitation, literally.

06:20.047 --> 06:21.715
- No, that was--
- That's because of them.

06:21.749 --> 06:22.950
- Yes.
- Because they asked him

06:22.983 --> 06:25.786
before all the...
- Yeah.

06:25.819 --> 06:28.589
- It's kind of irritating for
me because I've let James go.

06:28.622 --> 06:31.625
However, the people that have
organized the "Daily Mail" party

06:31.659 --> 06:34.628
requested him there because
they loved his music.

06:34.662 --> 06:37.898
It kind of makes me
a tiny bit nervous.

06:37.931 --> 06:40.033
I hope this little sh--
doesn't let me down.

06:40.067 --> 06:41.502
- Hello.
- Speak of the devil.

06:46.674 --> 06:48.809
- Are you ready for tonight?
- Yes.

06:48.842 --> 06:51.879
- And you know the policy about
drinking? Or no drinking?

06:51.912 --> 06:52.980
- Yeah.
- Are we aware of that?

06:53.013 --> 06:54.615
You swear to me?
- Swear.

I want to thank you guys too
for giving me,

06:56.484 --> 06:57.685

this opportunity tonight.

- Right, that's really cool.

- And it's a big chance for you
with them, so...

07:01.955 --> 07:03.791
- DJing this party is huge.

07:03.824 --> 07:06.894
And, uh, seeming that they asked
for me specifically as well

07:06.927 --> 07:09.029
is even huger, you know?

07:09.062 --> 07:11.231
Must be a pretty good DJ.

lately with the group.

07:39.026 --> 07:40.894
Katie and I got
in a huge fight...

07:40.928 --> 07:42.830
I have said, "I'm sorry.
It was tacky.

07:42.863 --> 07:44.632
It was classless. I'm sorry!"

07:44.665 --> 07:47.535
- Calm down.
- No! F--- this! God!

07:47.568 --> 07:47.601
But we did end up making up.

07:49.136 --> 07:50.871
- I just like things
being on the table.

07:50.904 --> 07:52.573
But I do love you,

07:56.610 --> 07:57.645
- We're good.

07:58.579 --> 07:59.513
- Shouldn't everybody be getting
here by now?

08:00.313 --> 08:00.948
- Um, I mean,
you know my friends.

08:01.882 --> 08:03.651
You say 3:00,
they show up at 4:15, so--

08:03.684 --> 08:04.918
- Yeah.
- Since we're leaving

08:06.186 --> 08:07.020
for New Orleans, I thought,
what's a better way

08:07.988 --> 08:10.858
to cool off than to get
in the f---ing pool?

08:10.891 --> 08:12.693

- Hey!

08:12.726 --> 08:13.961
- How's it going?
- I'm good.

08:13.994 --> 08:16.029
- You look cute.
- Thanks.

08:16.063 --> 08:18.065
I got my little Princess Leias
going on here.

08:18.098 --> 08:20.601
- Mm.
- Party's here.

08:20.634 --> 08:22.803
- Hey! What's up, dude?

08:22.836 --> 08:24.738
Hi, Britt. How you doing?

08:24.772 --> 08:27.608
- What the hell, dude?
What are you wearing?

08:27.641 --> 08:29.076
- This is what you wear
when you're defeated.

08:29.109 --> 08:31.745
- Hey, my mom needs her muumuu
back, dude.

08:31.779 --> 08:33.614
I don't even know where
to begin with this thing.

08:33.647 --> 08:34.748
- It's not so bad.
- Not only that, it's pink.

08:34.782 --> 08:37.551
I feel like this is what retired
people in Florida wear.

08:37.585 --> 08:39.753
- This is what you wear when
you've given up on life.

08:39.787 --> 08:41.321
I got this muumuu in Hawaii,
and initially,

08:41.354 --> 08:43.624
I thought it was kind of funny
and I liked it,

08:43.657 --> 08:47.060
but now, it's become more
of a symbolic garment

08:47.094 --> 08:50.631
that I put on when I've just
given up on the day.

08:50.664 --> 08:52.165
Hey, can we change the subject?
- Hey, hey, hey.

08:52.199 --> 08:54.635
Everything--everything all right
with you and Katie?

08:54.668 --> 08:56.336
- No, she's back.
Tequila Katie.

08:56.369 --> 08:59.039
She's f---ing back.
Don't look at me like that.

08:59.072 --> 09:00.774
- Hey, you're getting
married in a month.

09:00.808 --> 09:02.075
That's--you can look to that--
- No, it's fine.

09:02.109 --> 09:03.644
It's fine, I'ma sweep it
under the rug.

09:03.677 --> 09:05.846
- Yeah, there--that rug's
gonna be like this.

09:05.879 --> 09:07.848
Tom and Katie's relationship
is kind of like

09:07.881 --> 09:10.050
a stinky room,
and instead of, like,

09:10.083 --> 09:12.753
finding the source of the stink,

09:12.786 --> 09:16.657
they just Febreze the situation
and hope it goes away.

09:16.690 --> 09:19.192
- Katie's next level sh--, dude.

09:19.226 --> 09:21.762
- [laughs]
- Can she hear me?

09:21.795 --> 09:24.765
[dance music]

09:24.798 --> 09:31.071
*

09:31.104 --> 09:33.641
- Being the only one from LA,

09:33.674 --> 09:35.208
it's so much fun to have
all of my friends

09:35.242 --> 09:36.877
come to my hometown.

09:36.910 --> 09:38.679
Mom, where are
the Ping-Pong balls?

09:38.712 --> 09:39.847
- Mom, where are the balls?

09:41.014 --> 09:41.548
- I mean, we have beer pong
in the pool...

09:41.581 --> 09:44.752
- F---.
both: Yeah!

09:44.785 --> 09:45.819
- We need more beer.

09:45.853 --> 09:48.789
- Tacos, bikinis, booze.

09:48.822 --> 09:50.223
This is how we do it
in Azusa.

09:50.257 --> 09:51.959
*

09:51.992 --> 09:54.094
- Oh!
both: Yeah!

09:54.127 --> 09:55.896
- Oh, my God!
- F---!

09:55.929 --> 09:57.765
- We should put shots
in it next time.

09:57.798 --> 09:59.900
- No! Brittany!
- Are you crazy?

09:59.933 --> 10:01.969
- Hey!
- Is that my dog?

10:02.002 --> 10:03.671
- We've been a...[laughs].

10:03.704 --> 10:05.072
- He's like a wet noodle.

10:07.741 --> 10:10.077
- What's wrong?

10:13.413 --> 10:16.884
- Going back to the whole, um,
the bridal shower.

10:16.917 --> 10:18.118
- Yeah.
- You know, I feel like,

10:18.151 --> 10:20.120
Ariana made a choice
to really kind of

10:20.153 --> 10:21.789
put a damper on it all?

10:21.822 --> 10:23.724
- That is so beyond delusional

10:23.757 --> 10:25.025
for you to even think or say.

10:25.058 --> 10:26.894
- All right, like, it's my
f---ing bridal shower.

10:26.927 --> 10:28.128
I don't need to be
upset about it.

10:28.161 --> 10:29.262
I'm sorry, but like,
that's why

10:29.296 --> 10:30.898
she wasn't asked to be
a bridesmaid.

10:30.931 --> 10:34.001
Once again, like, we take
Ariana's side again.

10:34.034 --> 10:35.202
- That's so annoying.

10:35.235 --> 10:36.937
- I've really tried
not to be

10:36.970 --> 10:40.908
insecure about this,
but it's very frustrating

10:40.941 --> 10:42.876
when the man I'm going to marry

10:42.910 --> 10:46.680
puts another woman's feelings
above mine.

10:46.714 --> 10:49.182
It's really hurtful, actually.

10:49.216 --> 10:51.719
He should, like,
not be letting anyone,

10:51.752 --> 10:53.754
I don't care who they are,
get me down

10:53.787 --> 10:55.823
or make me feel that, like--
- I--I really--of course.

10:55.856 --> 10:57.190
I agree with you.

10:57.224 --> 10:58.759
- Do I need to be blond?

10:58.792 --> 11:00.227
So I need to be skinnier?

11:00.260 --> 11:02.696
I don't know what I need--
do I need to be cooler?

11:02.730 --> 11:04.698
Get drunk with the guys,
be so cool.

11:04.732 --> 11:08.836
Like, what do I got to do
to get Tom to respect me?

11:08.869 --> 11:12.906
So, yeah.
That's where we're at.

11:12.940 --> 11:14.775
- Coming up...
- Gross.

11:14.808 --> 11:17.778
- You're like a little jealous.

11:23.316 --> 11:24.752
[upbeat music]

11:25.685 --> 11:26.186
- Does he like it?
- Yeah, he likes it.

11:26.586 --> 11:27.254
Yeah, yeah.

11:27.287 --> 11:30.223
- Oh, baby.

11:30.257 --> 11:31.725
- I'm gonna get tacos.

11:31.759 --> 11:33.460
- Could you, like, make
a bunch of them?

11:33.493 --> 11:34.762
- How many?

11:34.795 --> 11:36.363
- For whoever wants
to just have one.

11:36.396 --> 11:38.866
Can I have one, then?
- I'll get you a taco!

11:38.899 --> 11:41.334
*

11:41.368 --> 11:43.170
- I'll shake my booty.

11:46.539 --> 11:48.776
- I've been dying for this group
to go to New Orleans.

11:48.809 --> 11:51.278
- Yeah.
It's gonna be so fun.

11:51.311 --> 11:52.780
- I know.
- And I'm excited for you.

11:52.813 --> 11:54.281
Like, I feel like
you need this.

11:54.314 --> 11:57.184
- I do need this, but then,
I'm also thinking

11:57.217 --> 11:59.753
I'm, uh, surrounded
by nothing but couples.

11:59.787 --> 12:01.488
So that's also
kind of depressing.

12:01.521 --> 12:03.156
- I'll be on dude patrol.
- Okay.

12:03.190 --> 12:05.058
- Fun patrol and dude patrol.
- Yeah.

12:05.092 --> 12:06.293
Okay.
- That works.

12:06.326 --> 12:07.460
- I'll just be on drink patrol.

12:07.494 --> 12:09.797
- So, I wanted to ask you,
because

12:09.830 --> 12:13.767
I have no idea what happened
with Katie and Tom.

12:13.801 --> 12:15.769
Is she okay?
- She's upset.

12:15.803 --> 12:17.905
I thought Schwartz was gonna
go over there and apologize

12:17.938 --> 12:20.740
and make it better,
but let's go ask Katie.

12:23.543 --> 12:25.445
- Do you want something?
- What are you drinking?

12:25.478 --> 12:28.448
- Vodka soda?
- Sure.

12:28.481 --> 12:30.317
- She's still fired up
from the night before.

12:30.350 --> 12:31.518
I can't talk to her,
and she can't talk to--

12:31.551 --> 12:33.153
- You can't say
you can't talk to her

12:33.186 --> 12:34.521
when she's gonna be your wife.
- No, but

12:34.554 --> 12:36.456
she doesn't have the humility
or the wherewithal,

12:36.489 --> 12:38.091
the self-awareness
to call herself out.

12:38.125 --> 12:40.093
- You should never talk about
your fiancÃ© like that.

12:40.127 --> 12:41.461
- It's true.
I'm not talking sh--.

12:41.494 --> 12:43.096
It's just true.

12:43.130 --> 12:46.499
- Katie's not perfect,
but Schwartz is no saint.

12:46.533 --> 12:49.937
If Schwartz keeps talking sh--
about Katie like this,

12:49.970 --> 12:51.805
homie's gonna have to answer
to me.

12:51.839 --> 12:53.941
You don't want Crazy Kristen
coming out.

12:53.974 --> 12:56.910
- She's so defensive.
She can't take any criticism.

12:56.944 --> 12:57.978
- But in--
- But do you not realize

12:58.011 --> 13:00.213
we're leaving for the bachelor
party in two days?

13:00.247 --> 13:02.215
- Yeah, I know.
- This is not good.

13:02.249 --> 13:05.185
- But it's--I'm used to it,
so it's not that bad either.

13:05.218 --> 13:06.553
- You're getting married,
for God's sakes.

13:06.586 --> 13:08.255
You guys can't even, like,

13:08.288 --> 13:09.489
stand the sight
of each other right now.

13:09.522 --> 13:11.191
Like, should this be
even happening?

13:11.224 --> 13:12.826
- You guys are getting married.
- I know. I know.

13:12.860 --> 13:14.527
I'm well aware of that.
- So unless you're gonna

13:14.561 --> 13:16.296
call this sh-- off--
- No, we're not calling it off.

13:16.329 --> 13:18.565
- So you need to just figure out
a different way--

13:18.598 --> 13:19.833
- Trust me--
- To deal with--

13:19.867 --> 13:21.401
- We've tried.
- Shay and I,

13:21.434 --> 13:23.336
after last year,
we've decided,

13:23.370 --> 13:25.172
you got to be like,
"Stop, stop."

13:25.205 --> 13:27.307
You have to kiss the person,
and you just have to hug them.

13:27.340 --> 13:29.209
- She would slap me.
- And as--I know.

13:29.242 --> 13:32.579
And as awkward as it seems,
think about it.

13:32.612 --> 13:35.148
Kisses make everything better.
- Oh, yeah, no, they don't.

13:35.182 --> 13:37.250
I don't know what world
you're living in.

13:37.284 --> 13:39.152
Getting marriage advice
from Scheana

13:39.186 --> 13:41.855
is like getting
sobriety advice from Shay.

13:41.889 --> 13:43.156
Kind of pointless.

13:43.190 --> 13:44.424
- Okay.
- Just go over, give her a kiss,

13:44.457 --> 13:46.326
say "I'm sorry, Bubba,
I love you,"

13:46.359 --> 13:48.328
and I'll stop bugging you
for the rest of the night.

13:48.361 --> 13:50.297
- I'm f---ing scared!

13:50.330 --> 13:52.966
Oh, God!
I'm so scared!

13:53.000 --> 13:54.534
- Just go. Go.

13:54.567 --> 13:56.169
- All right.
See you, dude.

13:56.203 --> 13:57.370
- Good luck.
- Okay.

13:57.404 --> 13:58.939
Listen, I love Katie.

13:58.972 --> 14:00.573
I really, truly do.
[laughing]

14:00.607 --> 14:02.409
I feel like I've tried
everything, you know?

14:02.442 --> 14:04.878
I've done therapy.
I asked her to marry me.

14:04.912 --> 14:08.215
I'm a man in a muumuu.
What else do I have to lose?

14:08.248 --> 14:10.283
I'm sorry, dude.
I'm sorry.

14:10.317 --> 14:11.651
I didn't mean to get you
upset again.

14:11.684 --> 14:13.887
Give me a kiss. I love you.
And we're gonna have fun--

14:13.921 --> 14:15.555
Give me a kiss.
- I don't want to right now.

14:15.588 --> 14:17.657
- Give me a kiss.
- Katie, you need to let it go.

14:17.690 --> 14:21.228
- Yeah, that was
for getting you upset.

14:21.261 --> 14:23.496
And, um, you know,
hurting your feelings

14:23.530 --> 14:25.232
with, uh, such--so many big,

14:25.265 --> 14:27.434
special moments in your life
approaching fast.

14:27.467 --> 14:27.534
So, hug it out?

14:30.337 --> 14:31.538
- I'm not gonna high five you.

14:32.639 --> 14:33.941
Tom wants to charm his way
out of this,

14:34.908 --> 14:36.643
but there's more sh--
going on between us

14:36.676 --> 14:38.578
than just him sticking up
for Ariana,

14:38.611 --> 14:41.248
and I don't think that
a hug and a high five

14:41.281 --> 14:43.383
is really gonna solve it.

14:43.416 --> 14:47.054
I have limits, and when I reach
those limits, I will explode.

14:47.087 --> 14:49.256
- I know. Yeah, I know.
- It would be nice

14:49.289 --> 14:51.591
that if from here on out,

14:51.624 --> 14:54.261
especially with our
bachelor/bachelorette coming up,

14:54.294 --> 14:57.030
that, like, you do make
my feelings a priority.

14:57.064 --> 14:58.331
- Okay.
- I should mean the most

14:58.365 --> 14:59.232
to you right now.
- You do.

15:00.367 --> 15:01.034
- And my feelings.
- That's unequivocal.

15:02.235 --> 15:03.236
- And that's why--but that's why
I'm acting out right now.

15:04.371 --> 15:05.372
Because I--I'm not getting that
from you right now,

15:06.373 --> 15:07.440
and it's hurtful.
- I know. Well, I'm sorry.

15:08.375 --> 15:10.043
I'm sorry. Bubba, I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

15:10.077 --> 15:11.611
- I don't want to fight
with things approaching.

15:11.644 --> 15:13.346
I don't want to have to--
- I don't either.

15:13.380 --> 15:16.349
- Resolution, my friends.

15:16.383 --> 15:18.551
- * We got to get away

15:18.585 --> 15:20.653
* To the special place

15:20.687 --> 15:22.422
* Got to get away

15:22.455 --> 15:24.424
* We got to get away

15:24.457 --> 15:26.093
* Come on and celebrate

15:26.126 --> 15:28.461
- This is...
- * We got to get away

15:28.495 --> 15:31.631
* We got to get away
[laughter]

15:31.664 --> 15:34.334
My nice, expensive luggage
is destroyed.

15:34.367 --> 15:36.669
- So is the ceiling.

15:36.703 --> 15:39.072
So, everything is clean
and ready to go.

15:39.106 --> 15:41.074
- Okay.
We don't need to bring towels.

15:41.108 --> 15:42.475
- Yeah.
- That's what a hotel's for.

15:42.509 --> 15:43.676
- Just a couple beach towels.

15:44.777 --> 15:45.412
- What beach are we going to?
We're going to a hotel.

15:45.445 --> 15:48.381
They have towels at the hotel.

15:48.415 --> 15:50.117
- Whatever, Jax.
- I'm not bringing

15:50.150 --> 15:52.019
the kitchen sink.
- You literally said

15:52.052 --> 15:53.120
when we walked in that--
- Wait.

15:53.153 --> 15:54.554
I'm not bringing everything
but--no.

15:54.587 --> 15:56.389
I'm not bringing everything
but the kitchen sink.

15:56.423 --> 15:57.657
All that laundry
has to be done today.

15:57.690 --> 16:01.028
- Your tone is very annoyed.
I'm gonna smack you.

16:01.061 --> 16:03.596
I always seem to be able
to deal with Jax's little

16:03.630 --> 16:05.565
hissy fits that he throws.

16:05.598 --> 16:07.134
- Why don't I tell your mother
what I've done for you

16:07.167 --> 16:08.535
since you've been here, okay?

16:09.669 --> 16:12.105
Sitting on the couch for a year
while I take care of you.

16:12.139 --> 16:14.107
- No matter how much
my feelings are hurt,

16:14.141 --> 16:16.143
I can never get Jax
to actually apologize.

16:16.176 --> 16:18.045
I didn't just do
all of this laundry?

16:18.078 --> 16:20.013
- But come on, honey.
That's--you know--

16:20.047 --> 16:21.714
- My dad always
told me growing up

16:21.748 --> 16:23.550
that yes,
everyone makes mistakes,

16:23.583 --> 16:25.618
but it takes a real man
to apologize.

16:25.652 --> 16:28.321
- You have one job: laundry.

16:28.355 --> 16:31.358
- What? I know you did not
just say that.

16:35.728 --> 16:38.031
- Hey.
Like my hat?

16:38.065 --> 16:40.033
- Mm-hmm.
- Sexy, isn't it?

16:40.067 --> 16:40.100
Gonna have to try to figure out
how to fit this

16:41.734 --> 16:43.703
in the suitcase over here,
'cause this thing's

16:43.736 --> 16:46.173
chock full of women's sh--.

16:46.206 --> 16:48.808
Schwartz suggested, for one
night of the bachelor party,

16:48.841 --> 16:50.710
we should all dress in drag.

16:50.743 --> 16:53.146
- Oh, yeah!
- Oh, yeah!

16:53.180 --> 16:56.349
I even quite fancy you myself!

16:56.383 --> 16:58.185
- Look, the butt pads came in.

16:58.218 --> 16:59.819
Should we give 'em a whirl?

16:59.852 --> 17:01.821
I'm going all the way.
I want all the best jewelry,

17:01.854 --> 17:04.524
the best makeup, the best wig,
the best outfit,

17:04.557 --> 17:07.594
the best shoes--yeah,
I'm f---ing doing this!

17:07.627 --> 17:09.062
Oh, yeah.

17:09.096 --> 17:10.830
- No! Gross!

17:10.863 --> 17:14.701
- Are you jealous?
You're like a little jealous.

17:14.734 --> 17:17.404
- Eww.

17:17.437 --> 17:19.606
*

17:19.639 --> 17:21.108
- I hate packing.

17:21.141 --> 17:23.843
- Did you want to bring
your snorkel?

17:23.876 --> 17:25.578
- Did you find that
in the bathtub?

17:25.612 --> 17:27.680
- Look what else I found!
- Oh, no!

17:27.714 --> 17:30.483
This was Jax's best friend
in Miami.

17:30.517 --> 17:31.484
- Jax!
- Ah!

17:32.285 --> 17:33.520
- Oh, you licked it, bro!
- Ew!

17:34.654 --> 17:36.756
- I thought it was can--don't
hit me, I have stitches.

17:36.789 --> 17:38.125
- You should bring it.
- I'm--of course

17:38.158 --> 17:39.392
I'm bringing it.
- You should.

17:40.327 --> 17:40.827
- I saved it for the next friend
to get married

17:41.428 --> 17:42.129
so I could dick-slap 'em.

17:43.330 --> 17:44.531
I really just hope
the next, like,

17:45.632 --> 17:46.733
few weeks, you know, they can
really pull it together.

17:46.766 --> 17:48.401
- Yeah.
- I can't imagine

17:48.435 --> 17:50.137
if a few weeks leading up
to our wedding,

17:50.170 --> 17:52.105
like, we were just
going at each other that much.

17:52.139 --> 17:54.474
Like, I don't know what, like,
I would have done.

17:54.507 --> 17:56.109
- I mean, no relationship's
perfect.

17:56.143 --> 17:58.611
Especially our group of friends.

17:58.645 --> 17:59.846
- Mm-hmm.
[sighs]

17:59.879 --> 18:01.514
- They'll figure it out.
- Totally.

18:01.548 --> 18:03.516
- That's not up to us.
We can just kind of be there--

18:03.550 --> 18:05.218
- Yeah, no, absolutely--
- Help as much as we can.

18:05.252 --> 18:07.654
- I want them to be
just be, like,

18:07.687 --> 18:09.522
the happiest they've ever
been in their lives

18:09.556 --> 18:10.423
for the next few weeks.

18:11.558 --> 18:13.260
I never plan on having another
wedding again.

18:13.293 --> 18:15.128
It's like, you know,
that's your one time.

18:15.162 --> 18:16.596
- Yeah.

18:16.629 --> 18:18.631
*

18:18.665 --> 18:20.700
- Look at this one.
- I like it.

18:20.733 --> 18:21.901
- I'm gonna rock this
at the pool.

18:21.934 --> 18:23.836
Doesn't just the air feel
fresher

18:23.870 --> 18:25.538
when you're not fighting?

18:25.572 --> 18:26.773
Take it in.
Ah.

18:26.806 --> 18:28.208
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

18:29.342 --> 18:30.810
- I'm glad that we talked, and
I think we should, like,

18:30.843 --> 18:34.547
have some vows that we can
make to each other.

18:34.581 --> 18:35.848
- Yeah.
- For the trip.

18:35.882 --> 18:38.751
- Yeah, what kind of vows?
- Like, I promise

18:38.785 --> 18:41.454
not to rage-text.

18:41.488 --> 18:42.622
Okay, what do you vow?

18:42.655 --> 18:43.823
- I would say I vow
to have your back,

18:43.856 --> 18:45.192
but that's not gonna be
an issue,

18:46.259 --> 18:46.726
because we're gonna be getting
along the whole time.

18:47.860 --> 18:48.861
- I know, but if--okay.
- Yes, I will have your back.

18:49.862 --> 18:50.697
This is the next chapter:
we're gonna leave

18:51.264 --> 18:52.265
all that sh-- behind us.

18:53.132 --> 18:53.800
I'm going into this trip
feeling really,

18:54.434 --> 18:55.202
really good about things.

18:55.802 --> 18:56.236
Whoa, whoa, we're--lookit.

18:57.069 --> 18:58.571
We're a united front
from here on out.

18:58.605 --> 19:00.273
No matter what happens,
we're unflappable.

19:00.307 --> 19:03.243
Even if, like, chaos erupts,
and everyone starts fighting,

19:03.276 --> 19:04.711
we're gonna be sitting there
smiling

19:04.744 --> 19:05.945
and sipping on our drinks.

19:05.978 --> 19:07.847
Whatever happens, we don't
turn on each other.

[upbeat music]

19:11.318 --> 19:12.719
- All righty.

19:12.752 --> 19:13.753
- Vamanos.

19:13.786 --> 19:16.223
New Orleans, here we come.

19:16.256 --> 19:18.725
- I love it!
- Just got some beads.

19:18.758 --> 19:22.495
I can't believe I had to show
my butt hole.

19:22.529 --> 19:23.863
- Ow!

[upbeat music]

19:31.271 --> 19:34.541

19:34.574 --> 19:36.843
- Next probably hour to two
hours I'll be sober,

19:36.876 --> 19:37.810
but after that,
it's all downhill.

19:37.844 --> 19:38.311
- This'll be the last time
you see me somewhat

19:39.979 --> 19:41.948
fresh-faced, coherent.

19:41.981 --> 19:48.955

19:48.988 --> 19:50.590
- Bead me!
- You're welcome!

19:50.623 --> 19:52.425
- Awesome.
- Don't we have to--

19:52.459 --> 19:55.428
don't we have to earn 'em?
Don't we have to--I'll show 'em.

19:55.462 --> 19:57.997
- Welcome, ladies, do you have
reservations with us?

19:58.030 --> 20:01.268
- Yes, it's, um, under Schwartz
or Maloney.

20:01.301 --> 20:02.969
- Schwartz or Maloney?
- We're gonna do a little

20:03.002 --> 20:05.638
anniversary dinner now so we can
meet up with y'all.

20:05.672 --> 20:06.939
- Okay.
- All right.

20:06.973 --> 20:08.341
I will see you guys
in a little bit!

20:08.375 --> 20:09.242
- Bye!
- Love you all!

20:09.276 --> 20:11.578
Today's our second
wedding anniversary,

20:11.611 --> 20:14.914
and although I'm aware we're on
a bachelor/bachelorette trip,

20:14.947 --> 20:18.485
not for me, we just got to do a
little something for us today.

20:18.518 --> 20:19.619
- Hi.
- How you doing--

20:19.652 --> 20:20.920
- Hi, I'm Jax. How are you?

20:20.953 --> 20:22.422
- What's the last name
on your reservation?

20:22.455 --> 20:24.023
- Taylor.
- All right, Mr. Taylor.

20:24.056 --> 20:26.926
Um, we were unable to obtain
authorization on your card.

20:26.959 --> 20:28.895
Did you have another method
of payment that you--

20:28.928 --> 20:30.897
- Every time! Yeah, this one.
- Okay.

20:30.930 --> 20:32.699
All right. Thank you.
- This has--

20:32.732 --> 20:34.967
this has been a reoccurring
thing with us.

20:35.001 --> 20:37.904
- Oh, my God, Jax,
your card is declined.

20:37.937 --> 20:39.238
- That can't be right.

20:40.239 --> 20:40.540
Every time I go somewhere,
they shut it off.

20:41.374 --> 20:41.674
It's 'cause I spend
so much money.

20:42.241 --> 20:43.343
- Sometimes it happens.

20:43.376 --> 20:44.344
- [sighs]

- Sexy suite.

20:50.683 --> 20:52.485
- Cute.

- I can't believe I've gone
this long in my life

20:54.421 --> 20:57.357
without ever going
to New Orleans.

20:57.390 --> 20:59.592
- Oh, my gosh, this is awesome.

20:59.626 --> 21:02.662
- Wow.
We got a view!

21:02.695 --> 21:05.365
Nice.
- Wow, it's really nice.

21:05.398 --> 21:07.534
Oh, it's f---ing perfect.

21:07.567 --> 21:09.336
I like it.
- Pretty.

21:09.369 --> 21:11.471
- Hello, you want to kiss me?

21:11.504 --> 21:18.478
*

21:21.381 --> 21:26.686
- This isn't exactly the
homecoming I had in my head.

21:28.588 --> 21:30.557
I'm watching all of my friends
grow up

21:30.590 --> 21:32.525
and make these big commitments,

21:32.559 --> 21:34.661
then I feel like everybody's
expecting me

21:34.694 --> 21:36.563
to be the life of the party.

21:36.596 --> 21:39.632
But I'm still hurting
from the breakup.

21:39.666 --> 21:41.801
So it's kind of difficult.

21:41.834 --> 21:43.470
Hello? Yes.

21:43.503 --> 21:46.573
I was wondering if I could order
room service.

21:46.606 --> 21:50.076
It's all gonna be going
to room 2203.

21:50.109 --> 21:51.944
- From here on out, let's,
like, savor the moment.

21:51.978 --> 21:52.044
Let's relish in the moment.
Watch this.

21:53.746 --> 21:55.047
Mm.
- Stop.

21:55.081 --> 21:56.549
- Do I taste like strippers?
Not yet.

21:56.583 --> 21:58.751
- Mm! Eww!
- Just give me a few hours.

21:58.785 --> 22:00.520
- Eww.
- I'm taking my shoes off.

22:00.553 --> 22:02.088
They're sweaty.

22:02.121 --> 22:03.523
- Really? Dude.

22:03.556 --> 22:05.057
- Let's crack a beer, or,
like, some champagne.

22:05.091 --> 22:06.759
Wait, did Lisa leave us
like a note or something?

22:06.793 --> 22:08.728
I saw a champagne bottle.
- Let me see.

22:08.761 --> 22:10.730
- I knew it.
- It's a date card.

22:10.763 --> 22:12.565
Let me read it.
- She sent it to me.

22:12.599 --> 22:14.066
- It says, "Katie and Tom.

22:14.100 --> 22:16.703
"The room is on me,
but only on the condition

22:16.736 --> 22:19.572
"that you make good use
of the bed.

22:19.606 --> 22:22.141
The bubbly is to help
break the ice."

22:22.174 --> 22:24.411
- I'm so grateful.
Lisa hooked us up

22:24.444 --> 22:26.413
with a really nice suite,
and, I mean,

22:26.446 --> 22:28.581
it is--it's ballin'.

22:28.615 --> 22:32.118
And I'm so excited about this,
but also,

22:32.151 --> 22:34.487
I'm thinking, "Man,
what if we trash it?"

22:34.521 --> 22:36.723
We probably will trash it.
[cork popping]

22:36.756 --> 22:38.124
We drinking out of the bottle?
- No!

22:38.157 --> 22:39.859
- It's a bachelor/bachelorette
party.

22:39.892 --> 22:42.128
- No!

22:42.161 --> 22:44.597
- Katie doesn't really want all
the bachelorettey stuff,

22:44.631 --> 22:47.700
but I had to get penis balloons.

22:47.734 --> 22:49.836

22:49.869 --> 22:52.705
Look, it's got the indentions.
- [laughs]

22:52.739 --> 22:55.542
- The inflatable penis.
That's for you boys.

22:55.575 --> 22:57.710
Look at the--ew!

22:57.744 --> 22:59.446
- Jesus.

22:59.479 --> 23:02.482
- Look how big the balls are.

23:04.851 --> 23:06.619
- Oh.
- Ooh, who's that?

23:06.653 --> 23:07.887
Uh-oh.
- Let me in!

23:07.920 --> 23:09.556
- Um, this is the couples suite.

23:09.589 --> 23:11.090
- Let me in! Let me in!

23:11.123 --> 23:13.125
- Come on in.
- Hi!

23:13.159 --> 23:14.494
- Oh, my God.

23:14.527 --> 23:15.728
- I'll get you
a glass of champagne.

23:15.762 --> 23:17.630
- Oh, I ordered you guys food.
- You did?

23:17.664 --> 23:19.098
- Yeah. I ordered it here.

23:19.131 --> 23:21.701
I also ordered my food
to come here too.

23:21.734 --> 23:23.903
I'm so excited.
- I know. Look at the view!

23:23.936 --> 23:25.171
You're back--oh, my God,
I keep forgetting

23:25.204 --> 23:27.139
you're back in your hometown.
- I can't--like, it's so weird--

23:27.173 --> 23:28.808
- It is so weird having you guys
here right now.

23:28.841 --> 23:30.610
I feel like all my worlds
are colliding.

23:30.643 --> 23:32.612
- Can you guys make me
one promise?

23:32.645 --> 23:34.113
- What?
- Okay.

23:34.146 --> 23:36.182
- Will you show your boobs
for beads one time?

23:36.215 --> 23:38.651
- I'm not showing my boobs!
- At Mardi Gras they do!

23:38.685 --> 23:40.787
- That's, like, hood rat.
- Just one.

23:40.820 --> 23:42.822
- I still have too many
breast reduction scars.

23:42.855 --> 23:44.190
I don't think I'm ready
for it yet.

- You know how--hey--
- I picture you just

23:48.227 --> 23:49.762
telling some like 18-year-old
kid that.

I got to..."

Oh.

Hey, guys.
Guys, look.

I used to do this as a job.

23:58.871 --> 24:01.207
- This is so nice.
- This is nice.

24:01.240 --> 24:02.742
- We should call her and
say thank you.

24:03.976 --> 24:04.577
- Should we call her now before
we're all hammered and sh--?

24:04.877 --> 24:05.578
- Yeah.

worthy of a biscuit?

24:13.853 --> 24:15.555
Okay.

24:15.588 --> 24:18.858
RosÃ©, no, finish what's
in your mouth first.

24:18.891 --> 24:20.493
No more biscuits.

24:20.527 --> 24:23.262
Have a drinky.

Hello?
- Hi, Lisa.

24:25.264 --> 24:27.500
It's Katie.
- Hi, Lisa, it's Tom.

24:27.534 --> 24:30.136
And Stassi too.
- Hi, Lisa.

24:30.169 --> 24:31.538
- What are you doing there,
Stassi?

24:32.605 --> 24:33.540
They're supposed to be having
a romantic moment.

Get out of there.

- She's a third wheel.
- How's the room?

24:39.011 --> 24:41.981
- Thank you so, so much.
- You didn't have to do that.

24:42.014 --> 24:44.851
You went above and beyond,
and it means the world to us.

24:44.884 --> 24:47.820
- Of course I had to do that.
I wanted to do that.

24:47.854 --> 24:50.256
- Thank you so much
for the champagne too.

24:50.289 --> 24:51.891
- Oh, listen, you're welcome.

24:51.924 --> 24:53.593
You guys mean the world to me.

24:53.626 --> 24:56.796
And this is the time for you
guys to enjoy yourselves

24:56.829 --> 24:59.866
and celebrate before
the hard work begins.

24:59.899 --> 25:02.268
Trust me, I've done
35 years of it.

25:02.301 --> 25:04.604
Don't get scared, Schwartzy.

25:04.637 --> 25:06.172
- What do you mean by hard work?
- Marriage.

25:06.205 --> 25:07.373
- Well, we'll talk
about it later.

25:07.406 --> 25:09.876
- I didn't have a bachelorette
party because

25:09.909 --> 25:11.978
Ken was so naughty,

25:12.011 --> 25:14.581
if I'm really honest, and I
don't like to admit this,

25:14.614 --> 25:15.982
I didn't want him to have
a bachelor party

25:16.015 --> 25:17.917
'cause I knew if he had
a bachelor party,

25:17.950 --> 25:19.852
we'd probably end up
not getting married.

25:19.886 --> 25:23.255
Anyway, guys, I've got to get
back to my friends.

25:23.289 --> 25:24.891
- Thank you, Lisa,
we really appreciate it,

25:24.924 --> 25:27.927
and we miss you.
- All right, bye, darling.

25:27.960 --> 25:29.896
[upbeat music]

25:29.929 --> 25:31.931
[crowd chatter]

25:31.964 --> 25:33.933
- Yay!
- Thank you!

25:33.966 --> 25:35.902
All right, you guys,
it's this way!

25:35.935 --> 25:37.970
- This is awesome. Stassi.

25:38.004 --> 25:40.339
This your home turf?
- It's my home turf!

25:40.372 --> 25:43.342
Bourbon Street is an amazing
street where anything goes.

25:43.375 --> 25:45.712
- This is probably where
the girls show their boobs?

25:45.745 --> 25:46.979
- Boobs!
- Yeah!

25:47.013 --> 25:48.581
[cheering]

25:48.615 --> 25:51.784
- Everybody's just so lively
and fun.

25:51.818 --> 25:53.720
- Ew!

25:53.753 --> 25:55.354
- It's just a really
f---ing good time.

25:55.387 --> 25:57.056
- Yeah, I just got some beads.

25:57.089 --> 25:58.791
I can't believe I had to show
my butt hole.

25:58.825 --> 26:00.760
- [laughing]
- Feels very festive

26:00.793 --> 26:03.796
and lively,
and it's the best

26:03.830 --> 26:06.332
welcoming first night out.

26:06.365 --> 26:07.934
Ow!

26:07.967 --> 26:10.670
That f---ing hurts!

26:10.703 --> 26:11.671
Ah!

26:11.704 --> 26:14.674
[loud jazz trumpeting]

26:14.707 --> 26:16.008
*

26:16.042 --> 26:17.777
- Doing that dance move!

26:17.810 --> 26:20.713
*

26:20.747 --> 26:22.782
- The first time I ever
got drunk was

26:22.815 --> 26:24.984
when I went to prom,
and I took my best friend,

26:25.017 --> 26:27.620
and he took me
to Bourbon Street.

26:27.654 --> 26:30.256
Whoo! Whoo!

26:30.289 --> 26:32.825
And fed me every single shot

26:32.859 --> 26:35.094
to the point where I just

26:35.127 --> 26:37.630
puked everywhere,
in public,

26:37.664 --> 26:39.031
like, all over the place.

26:39.065 --> 26:40.366
Whoo!

26:41.400 --> 26:42.368
Police had to escort me
back to the limo

26:43.102 --> 26:45.104
that my dad had rented for us.

26:45.137 --> 26:47.106
So there's that.

26:47.139 --> 26:51.744
*

26:51.778 --> 26:53.345
- Let's go get drunk.

26:53.379 --> 26:54.814
- Coming up...
- I didn't come--

26:54.847 --> 26:55.948
- It's okay.
- All the way to New Orleans

26:56.949 --> 26:57.750
to have all of our issues
thrown in my face.

26:58.918 --> 26:59.285
- No, he's not doing that.
- No, I'm not throwing any--

26:59.986 --> 27:00.486
- I'm gonna go try and have fun.

27:07.694 --> 27:09.228
- * We'll get stronger

27:09.929 --> 27:11.163
* We'll be better

27:11.197 --> 27:12.865
- Where are we going?

27:12.899 --> 27:14.867
- We're going
to my favorite bar.

27:14.901 --> 27:16.936
*

27:16.969 --> 27:19.238
- So cute!
[indistinct chatter]

27:19.271 --> 27:20.940
- Girls on this side,
guys on this side.

27:20.973 --> 27:22.942
- Yeah!
- I did have my concerns

27:22.975 --> 27:25.077
about it being a joint
bachelor/bachelorette party,

27:25.111 --> 27:27.947
but now that we're here,
and we're on Bourbon Street,

27:27.980 --> 27:30.149
I'm like,
"This is gonna be awesome."

27:30.182 --> 27:33.052
- I went and ordered
all these for the girls.

27:33.085 --> 27:34.286
They're shot glasses.

27:34.320 --> 27:35.955
- Wait, you can put
a shot in there?

27:35.988 --> 27:37.289
- We have beverages.
We have beverages.

27:37.323 --> 27:39.959
- Finally.
- Cheers, guys.

27:39.992 --> 27:42.261
- Happy bachelor party, huh?
- Yes.

27:42.294 --> 27:44.030
- Thank you.
- Hey, you know what?

27:44.063 --> 27:45.898
I need to--I need to take
this sweatshirt off.

27:45.932 --> 27:47.133
It's getting a little hot,
you know?

27:47.166 --> 27:48.367
- Oh, no.
- Yeah, get comfortable.

27:48.400 --> 27:50.369
- Just gonna take this thing
off real quick.

27:50.402 --> 27:52.471
- Oh!
- Oh!

27:52.504 --> 27:56.042
- For a long time,
I was Tom #1,

27:56.075 --> 27:58.110
but as I've grown to know you,

27:58.144 --> 28:01.480
I--I have--feel like
I have become...

28:01.513 --> 28:03.415
- Oh!
- Tom #2.

28:03.449 --> 28:05.384
all: Oh!

28:05.417 --> 28:09.055
This is the real Tom #1 shirt.
Put it on.

28:09.088 --> 28:10.156
- You know that
Kelly Clarkson song,

28:10.189 --> 28:13.259
"Some people wait a lifetime
for a moment like this"?

28:13.292 --> 28:15.494
- Whoa!
- Whoo!

28:15.527 --> 28:17.496
- I love you, man.
- I love you too.

28:17.529 --> 28:21.968
This is the moment I've been
waiting a lifetime for.

28:22.001 --> 28:23.335
- [laughing]

28:23.369 --> 28:26.338
[dance music]

28:26.372 --> 28:29.308
*

28:29.341 --> 28:30.309
- Hi, guys.
- Hi.

28:30.342 --> 28:31.410
- Let me take you to your table.

28:31.443 --> 28:34.981
- Thank you.
- Right this way.

28:35.014 --> 28:36.282
Can I get you guys
anything to drink?

28:36.315 --> 28:38.084
- Water's fine.
Thank you so much.

28:38.117 --> 28:40.186
- Shay's been sober
for eight months now,

28:40.219 --> 28:43.155
and I'm really happy and proud
to be celebrating

28:43.189 --> 28:46.058
the second anniversary
with Shay.

28:46.092 --> 28:49.361
- All righty.

28:51.330 --> 28:53.465
Whoa.
Damn.

28:53.499 --> 28:54.566
- [laughing]

28:56.068 --> 28:58.270
This boudoir book is the perfect
second anniversary gift.

28:58.304 --> 29:00.306
- Whoa.
- I mean, he loves

29:00.339 --> 29:02.341
when I dress up in lingerie.

29:02.374 --> 29:04.210
- Wow, these are incredible.

29:04.243 --> 29:06.545
- He's probably gonna want to go
straight back to our hotel room.

29:06.578 --> 29:08.447
- Babe, thank you so much.
- Yeah.

29:08.480 --> 29:10.449
- I love it.

29:10.482 --> 29:12.952
- Like a year ago,
I wouldn't have thought

29:12.985 --> 29:14.220
we'd already be in this place.

29:14.253 --> 29:17.489
Our first year of marriage
was very difficult.

29:17.523 --> 29:19.325
- How many were you
taking a day?

29:19.358 --> 29:21.293
- Probably like five.
- Wow.

29:21.327 --> 29:24.030
- Why did you marry me?
Why?

29:24.063 --> 29:25.497
It's like, whenever I get,
like, annoyed

29:25.531 --> 29:27.499
that you're at the studio late,
I just think,

29:27.533 --> 29:29.335
I'm like, okay,
would I rather him be,

29:29.368 --> 29:30.970
like, drunk at a bar,

29:31.003 --> 29:32.504
or home being an asshole--
- Yeah.

29:32.538 --> 29:34.006
- Or, like, unhappy.
I'm like,

29:34.040 --> 29:36.175
he's in his happy place
working on music.

29:36.208 --> 29:37.476
- Yeah.
- Staying sober.

29:37.509 --> 29:39.111
Like, it takes a lifetime
to accomplish

29:39.145 --> 29:41.180
what you have in a year.
- The main reason why

29:41.213 --> 29:43.249
I got to where I was
is because of you.

29:43.282 --> 29:44.483
- Aww.

29:44.516 --> 29:46.518
- You never stopped loving me.

29:46.552 --> 29:49.088
I am more in love with you
than I ever have been

29:49.121 --> 29:51.323
in my entire life.

29:51.357 --> 29:53.492
Losing you is the worst thing
that could ever happen to me.

29:53.525 --> 29:55.027
- Ditto.

29:55.061 --> 29:56.996
- I love you.
- I love you!

29:57.029 --> 29:59.331
- Give you a kiss?
- Yeah.

29:59.365 --> 29:59.398
Marriage is work.
It's not like you can just

30:02.134 --> 30:03.836
break up and move out.

30:03.870 --> 30:06.272
I'm very proud of us for
as far as we've come.

30:06.305 --> 30:08.440
I can't wait to spend the rest
of my life with you.

30:08.474 --> 30:10.176
And I don't care if they say
it's bad luck

30:10.209 --> 30:12.378
to cheers with waters,
cheers to you.

30:12.411 --> 30:14.213
- Cheers to you.
- So proud of you.

30:14.246 --> 30:17.516
I love you.
- I love you too.

30:17.549 --> 30:21.320
*

30:21.353 --> 30:22.855
- This looks like--
- We are a little rusty--

30:22.889 --> 30:25.257
- A f---ing hangover
waiting to happen.

30:25.291 --> 30:27.326
What the hell is it?
- It's a hurricane.

30:27.359 --> 30:30.596
And you're in New Orleans--
- Is it Hurricane TomKat?

30:30.629 --> 30:32.865
- It's Hurricane TomKat.

30:32.899 --> 30:34.333
- Wow.
- Bukkake face?

30:34.366 --> 30:36.535
- Yeah!
- Hi!

30:36.568 --> 30:39.538
- Yay!
[all cheering]

30:39.571 --> 30:40.539
- My man!
- What up?

30:40.572 --> 30:43.309
- There he is!
- Yo!

30:43.342 --> 30:45.077
- I feel like you have to, like,
go in between,

30:45.111 --> 30:46.645
like, both jaybles.
- When they're--

30:46.678 --> 30:48.414
when there's a lull
in their conversation,

30:48.447 --> 30:50.249
I'm like, "All right, I'm gonna
go in there."

30:50.282 --> 30:54.153
- I mean, of course Ariana has
to do something "Alternative."

30:54.186 --> 30:56.155
Do you guys want to do
a sÃ©ance?

30:56.188 --> 30:57.356
- She's not just a groomsman.

30:57.389 --> 30:58.557
- Love you!
- Ariana, get in here.

30:58.590 --> 31:00.259
- Love you guys too!

31:00.292 --> 31:01.593
- She's able to balance that
with being

31:01.627 --> 31:03.295
like a makeshift bridesmaid.

31:03.329 --> 31:05.564
- Oh. Ugh.
- Anybody want some Jager?

31:05.597 --> 31:07.433
- But then,
I'm so not surprised.

31:07.466 --> 31:09.601
- Oh, are these shots?

31:09.635 --> 31:12.571
Let's split it.

31:12.604 --> 31:14.440
- Oh, my God, there's like
lipstick on this.

31:14.473 --> 31:15.674
- It's one of our friends',
I think.

31:15.707 --> 31:18.544
I think.
What if it's not? Eww.

31:18.577 --> 31:21.313
*

31:21.347 --> 31:23.182
- How's it going?

31:23.215 --> 31:25.084
- Good. It's--I can't--
like, it's--

31:25.117 --> 31:26.685
everything goes by so fast.

31:26.718 --> 31:28.620
Like, this whole summer's just,
like, blown by.

31:28.654 --> 31:30.389
- It's crazy.

31:30.422 --> 31:32.591
Like, you guys have literally
pulled this wedding

31:32.624 --> 31:35.261
together and everything,
like, so fast.

31:35.294 --> 31:38.530
- Um, I've been losing my mind.

31:38.564 --> 31:40.566
[dramatic music]

31:40.599 --> 31:44.536
90% of the reason why
Tom and I fight is because of

31:44.570 --> 31:48.140
tension or hurt feelings between

31:48.174 --> 31:50.209
our friends and us, you know?

31:50.242 --> 31:53.479
So, you know, like,
what had happened

31:53.512 --> 31:55.948
at my bridal shower,
Ariana having, like,

31:55.982 --> 31:59.451
unwavering loyalty and defend
Lala to me,

31:59.485 --> 32:01.353
like, really?

32:01.387 --> 32:03.289
Like--it--like--

32:03.322 --> 32:05.524
It's just like so inappropriate.

32:05.557 --> 32:08.527
- The reality is,
when Lala first came to Sur--

32:08.560 --> 32:10.629
- No. Sorry.
I'm gonna cut you off there.

32:10.662 --> 32:12.164
Not listening to that.

32:12.198 --> 32:12.264
- You didn't confront her about
her trips,

32:13.565 --> 32:17.136
or anything, or like--like how
many blow jobs she has to give?

32:17.169 --> 32:19.238
- You didn't like her either
when she started,

32:19.271 --> 32:21.373
so why is it coming down on me?
- Nobody is chastising you.

32:21.407 --> 32:23.275
Look, my biggest concern, Katie.

32:23.309 --> 32:25.677
I feel like you and Schwartz
have argued a lot about sh--.

32:25.711 --> 32:29.648
And I feel like there's
something deeper underneath.

32:31.317 --> 32:36.255
- There's nothing deep-rooted.

32:36.288 --> 32:40.159
- I mean, I know that
a lot of your arguments

32:40.192 --> 32:42.694
tend to fall during a time

32:42.728 --> 32:45.597
where either or both of you
have been drinking.

32:45.631 --> 32:47.499
- Usually both.

32:47.533 --> 32:49.735
Like, it's so easy for her
to downplay when we do

32:49.768 --> 32:50.936
go into those insane fights--
- Yeah.

32:50.969 --> 32:53.505
- 'Cause a lot of times, she
doesn't remember a lot of it.

32:53.539 --> 32:57.576
- I think that's
a scary thing to hear.

32:57.609 --> 33:00.479
- The wedding is literally
three weeks away.

33:00.512 --> 33:02.014
As of today.

33:02.048 --> 33:04.016
Like, what if you guys
just meet with

33:04.050 --> 33:06.385
somebody who is just
completely objective

33:06.418 --> 33:07.686
and just talk--
just talk

33:07.719 --> 33:10.222
some of these little
f---ing things out.

33:10.256 --> 33:12.491
- I'm just saying, to like,
think that like, what, like,

33:12.524 --> 33:14.560
"And before you guys walk down,
like, make sure

33:14.593 --> 33:16.395
you want to do this."

33:16.428 --> 33:18.197
This is my bachelorette party.

33:18.230 --> 33:20.366
I just be just dancing,
and laughing,

33:20.399 --> 33:22.601
and having drinks,
and not be talking

33:22.634 --> 33:26.705
about my relationship
with Dr. Tom Sandoval.

33:26.738 --> 33:29.441
When do we get to have fun?
- We are having fun.

33:29.475 --> 33:32.378
- I haven't had fun in--
- Yeah you have.

33:32.411 --> 33:33.712
- You're not having fun?
What's wrong?

33:33.745 --> 33:35.581
- Tom thinks we should go
to therapy.

33:35.614 --> 33:37.516
- Bubba.
- Well, I didn't come here--

33:37.549 --> 33:39.218
- Bubba, it's okay.
- I didn't come all the way

33:40.386 --> 33:40.452
to New Orleans to have all of
our issues thrown in my face.

33:41.620 --> 33:41.653
- No, he's not doing that!
- No, I'm not throwing any--

33:42.721 --> 33:43.789
No, I don't want to do that.
- Nobody's talking.

33:44.756 --> 33:45.524
I love you.
- I'm gonna go try and have fun.

33:46.192 --> 33:47.459
- But I'm--Bubba, come back.

33:47.493 --> 33:48.760
Bubba, it's okay.

33:51.863 --> 33:53.732
- Coming up...
- I was an asshole,

[upbeat music]

34:06.178 --> 34:09.081
*

34:09.115 --> 34:11.317
- [sighs] So.

34:11.350 --> 34:13.219
How was everything tonight?
How many people did we have?

34:13.252 --> 34:15.254
- It was pretty good. 240.

34:15.287 --> 34:16.488
- Okay, good.

34:16.522 --> 34:18.824
- Oh. Perfect.

34:18.857 --> 34:20.359
How are you?

34:20.392 --> 34:22.694
- Do you have a reservation?
'Cause we're booked up.

34:22.728 --> 34:25.797
- [chuckles] I'm just coming to
say hi to Lisa.

34:25.831 --> 34:27.366
Can I see you outside
for a moment?

34:27.399 --> 34:29.435
- Okay. Got a couple of minutes.

34:29.468 --> 34:31.870
- All right. Perfect.

34:31.903 --> 34:34.840
Your new hostess
seems very lovely, very polite.

34:34.873 --> 34:37.109
I wonder how she is
to customers.

34:37.143 --> 34:39.311
- Well, I don't think she sleeps
with all our customers.

34:39.345 --> 34:40.779
- I didn't sleep with her.

34:40.812 --> 34:42.248
- Do you want to start
a problem with me

34:42.281 --> 34:43.515
because you hooked up with me--
- No.

34:43.549 --> 34:45.817
I didn't hook up with you.
Ever.

34:45.851 --> 34:49.188
No, Lisa, I wasn't smashing
with smushy troll-face, okay?

34:49.221 --> 34:51.290
I didn't know trolls
worked at Sur.

34:51.323 --> 34:54.160
- Anyway, what can I do you for?

34:54.193 --> 34:56.862
- Um, just, um, checking in
with you, you know?

34:56.895 --> 34:59.331
I just wanted to come talk to
you about the other night,

34:59.365 --> 35:00.699
at the "Daily Mail" party.

35:01.733 --> 35:02.334
It went really well.
I didn't drink the whole night.

35:03.335 --> 35:04.336
Killed my DJ set.
James Kennedy,

35:05.137 --> 35:06.338
the white Kanye West, is back.

35:06.372 --> 35:07.706
Forget what you heard,

35:07.739 --> 35:09.741
and remember where
you heard it first.

35:09.775 --> 35:09.841
Felt really good
about the other night,

35:11.510 --> 35:13.279
and everything really
seems to be

35:13.312 --> 35:15.347
coming a little bit
together for me, and, uh--

35:15.381 --> 35:17.416
- Is it? How many nights
a week are you working?

35:17.449 --> 35:19.351
- Honestly, Friday's
still open for me.

35:19.385 --> 35:21.553
Wednesday's still open for me.
Monday, Tuesday, I'm off.

35:21.587 --> 35:23.389
Sunday I'm off, so--
so two nights a week, really.

35:23.422 --> 35:24.390
- So only working
two nights a week.

35:24.423 --> 35:26.225
So what are you doing
the rest of the time?

35:27.393 --> 35:29.828
- I would honestly just love to
work here on Wednesdays again.

35:29.861 --> 35:31.797
- I just can't do that
right now.

35:31.830 --> 35:34.200
- Do you think I could like,
maybe work at Pump on a Friday?

35:34.233 --> 35:36.302
- No, no, no.
- 'Cause no one's up there.

35:36.335 --> 35:39.171
- No, what part of "No" don't
you understand? No.

35:39.205 --> 35:42.441
- Had to ask, know what I mean?
- No.

35:42.474 --> 35:44.910
James may look at this
like a one-night audition

35:44.943 --> 35:49.348
to gain back his full-time
residency at Sur and Pump,

35:49.381 --> 35:51.750
but to me, this is just
honoring a commitment.

35:51.783 --> 35:53.352
So what am I supposed to think?

35:53.385 --> 35:55.754
You know, if you show me
you're sober for a year.

35:55.787 --> 35:57.356
You show me that you're doing
an excellent job--

35:57.389 --> 35:59.491
- A year? I mean--
- Well, I could say, you know,

35:59.525 --> 36:00.959
you're never coming back--
- Right.

36:00.992 --> 36:03.462
- Which is exactly
what my intention was.

36:03.495 --> 36:05.931
- [sighs]

36:05.964 --> 36:07.866
All right, well, I don't want to
take up too much of your time.

36:07.899 --> 36:09.535
I know it's very precious--
- You've taken up

36:09.568 --> 36:10.902
a lot of my time
in the past, James.

36:10.936 --> 36:13.205
- Yes.
- All right, then.

36:13.239 --> 36:15.607
- All right. I'll see you later.
Say hi to Max for me.

36:15.641 --> 36:17.209
Think I might see him
later tonight.

36:17.243 --> 36:18.477
- You can say hello
to Max yourself.

36:18.510 --> 36:19.845
- All right, bye Lisa.
Thank you.

36:19.878 --> 36:23.282
- Bye, James.

36:23.315 --> 36:26.985
[dance music]

36:27.018 --> 36:28.987
- Wait, no--
- Best girl around.

36:29.020 --> 36:31.223
- What was that? That was--
- I have no idea.

36:31.257 --> 36:33.225
- That was vodka?
- Love it. Thank you.

36:33.259 --> 36:35.294
- This makes me happy.

36:35.327 --> 36:38.297
Having everybody in my hometown
and my favorite bar.

36:38.330 --> 36:38.397
Makes me be able to, like,
forget other things.

36:41.533 --> 36:43.369
- And then she cooks, see?

36:43.402 --> 36:44.870
- Do you want to talk to me
for a second?

36:44.903 --> 36:47.473
- What?
- We'll be right back.

36:47.506 --> 36:50.376
- Oh.

36:50.409 --> 36:54.580
- I thought I was gonna feel
really sad here because

36:54.613 --> 36:57.383
I'm the only one not
in a relationship.

36:57.416 --> 37:00.352
There's no giving kisses
to your boyfriend right now.

37:00.386 --> 37:01.219
- [laughing]
- When you're talking

37:02.288 --> 37:03.289
to somebody that's going
through a breakup.

37:03.955 --> 37:05.023
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- So like, put that

37:05.056 --> 37:06.425
kiss thing away.

37:07.526 --> 37:09.395
- Yeah, I'm talking
to Stassi about serious stuff.

37:09.428 --> 37:11.930
- Ah. Okay. All right. Okay.

37:11.963 --> 37:14.032
- He's so drunk.
- I'm sorry, I'm a little drunk.

37:14.065 --> 37:15.401
- I know you're drunk.
It's okay.

37:15.434 --> 37:18.570
- Continue.
- You came over here,

37:18.604 --> 37:21.273
and gave Brittany kissy faces--
- I miss my girlfriend!

37:21.307 --> 37:23.342
- When you knew I'm going
through a breakup--

37:23.375 --> 37:24.376
- Listen--
- And I don't need, like,

37:24.410 --> 37:26.878
everybody being coupley
right in front of my face.

37:26.912 --> 37:29.515
- I just want to help.
- Please, help. Then help me.

37:29.548 --> 37:31.583
- What you're going through
right now, I--I'm sorry.

37:31.617 --> 37:34.286
What--whatever--
- Yeah, it f---ing sucks.

37:34.320 --> 37:36.688
- I--I just don't understand

37:36.722 --> 37:38.424
why he could never be
in the picture.

37:38.457 --> 37:39.558
Why would he never
be there for you?

37:39.591 --> 37:40.626
What was the issue?

37:40.659 --> 37:41.993
- He didn't like Jax
or something?

37:42.027 --> 37:43.495
- I mean--
- Jax?

37:43.529 --> 37:45.331
Dude--this is six years ago.

37:45.364 --> 37:47.699
- I mean...

37:47.733 --> 37:50.068
You were never in the cards
for him to be--

37:50.101 --> 37:51.970
like, he was not gonna
be around you.

37:52.003 --> 37:54.306
You made a bunch of mistakes.

37:54.340 --> 37:57.443
Jax has done the worst things

37:57.476 --> 37:59.611
that you could do to someone
to me.

37:59.645 --> 38:02.414
And Patrick knows everything.

38:02.448 --> 38:05.016
Where'd you sleep last night?

38:05.050 --> 38:07.319
- Where do you think?

38:07.353 --> 38:08.554
- You've spent the last year

38:08.587 --> 38:10.522
professing I'm the only
one for you

38:10.556 --> 38:11.890
while you were banging

38:11.923 --> 38:14.326
one of my closest friends,
Kristen.

38:14.360 --> 38:16.528
What did I ever do to you,
like, to deserve this?

38:16.562 --> 38:17.696
What did I do?

38:17.729 --> 38:20.366
Patrick never wanted to come
to group events

38:20.399 --> 38:22.501
because he didn't want
to run into Jax.

38:22.534 --> 38:24.670
He didn't want to have to go
and shake his hand.

38:24.703 --> 38:27.005
So, we just kept
our lives separate.

38:27.038 --> 38:30.742
But that kind of drew a wedge
between me and Patrick,

38:30.776 --> 38:34.346
because I felt like I was
leading two different lives.

38:34.380 --> 38:37.949
- If a man loved you--
he's using that as a cop-out.

38:37.983 --> 38:39.918
- Oh, God.
- All right.

38:39.951 --> 38:43.455
- That's so stupid.
- It is not stupid!

38:43.489 --> 38:45.491
It would make me feel so much
better if you just

38:45.524 --> 38:48.059
looked at me and you said,
"I'm very sorry."

38:48.093 --> 38:50.128
Like, that would mean
everything to me.

38:50.161 --> 38:51.963
- This is not--
this is such a waste.

38:51.997 --> 38:54.766
- Wow.
Be more selfish.

38:54.800 --> 38:57.035
It--don't roll your eyes!

38:57.068 --> 38:59.571
- I'm not rolling my eyes.
- You don't get it!

38:59.605 --> 39:00.972
You don't get it!
- I don't get it?

- You don't get it.

39:16.622 --> 39:17.589
- I don't--I don't get it.

39:17.623 --> 39:18.624
- No, you don't get it!

39:19.558 --> 39:19.825
- What--what else
do you want me to say?

39:20.692 --> 39:22.828
- "Sorry" is what I want
to hear you say.

39:22.861 --> 39:25.697
Jax, you could release yourself.

39:25.731 --> 39:27.999
You could release
anything that you--

39:28.033 --> 39:30.135
- What? Everybody knows!
- You could just say,

39:30.168 --> 39:31.703
"I'm so sorry."
- Okay.

- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

I am sorry.

should want to be around.

I apologize.

Thank you for saying that.
Thank you.

To finally hear him
be remorseful,

40:20.051 --> 40:22.921
admit this guilt,
and look me in the eye

40:22.954 --> 40:25.090

so many other people

I can't help but be a little
bit jealous right now,

apologize to me

as a poster.

- [screaming]

41:47.773 --> 41:50.208
- Make it rain, Katie!

41:50.241 --> 41:52.711
- Wanted to upgrade
Tom and Katie's room.

41:52.744 --> 41:54.646
Well, hopefully, he's not
sleeping on the couch.

41:54.680 --> 41:55.914
[laughter]

41:57.115 --> 41:58.216
- Like Katie Maloney would say:
don't discount my feelings.

41:59.317 --> 42:00.018
- Don't pick a fight with me.
- You don't remember

42:01.052 --> 42:01.987
'cause you were too drunk.
- No, I wasn't, Tom!

42:03.054 --> 42:04.923
- All right, Katie.
- It's so buried deep down.

42:04.956 --> 42:07.993
And now she is pissed off about
every little thing.

42:08.026 --> 42:10.128
But like, he has to admit this
before the wedding. He has to.

42:10.161 --> 42:11.997
- You don't want to spend
the rest of your life like this.

42:12.030 --> 42:15.300
Whether you love her or not.

42:15.333 --> 42:16.835
- Yo, how does this work?

42:16.868 --> 42:18.704
- We're just getting f---ing
started, baby.

42:18.737 --> 42:20.972
[cheering and hooting]

42:21.006 --> 42:23.174
- Can you guys help me out?
Where is my penis?

42:23.208 --> 42:25.243
- It's not there.
- If you see it,

42:25.276 --> 42:28.046
you can play around with it for
a while, but I need it back.

42:28.079 --> 42:30.181
- Guys, back off.
- I want you and Katie

42:30.215 --> 42:32.784
to f---ing be on the best page
ever before you get married.

42:32.818 --> 42:34.185
Please.
- I will roast your ass.

42:34.219 --> 42:34.285
If you want to go
to war with me.

42:35.787 --> 42:36.888
- Okay, now you're being
Tequila Tom.

42:36.922 --> 42:39.224
- It doesn't concern you!
- Stop talking, Sandoval!

42:39.257 --> 42:41.192
- Are you serious?
- If someone wants to tell me

42:41.226 --> 42:43.328
what the f--- is happening,
that'd be cool.

42:43.361 --> 42:45.063
- Yes, I made out
with that chick.

42:45.096 --> 42:46.965
- And you didn't f--- her.
And you didn't f--- her, right?

42:46.998 --> 42:49.034
- I did not.
- That's a war out there.

42:49.067 --> 42:51.202
- I'm done with her.
I'm done with Katie.

42:51.236 --> 42:52.771
I'm not marrying her.

42:52.804 --> 42:53.839
I'm not.

42:54.873 --> 42:55.140
