So everybody has to
think on their feet.

05:14.555 --> 05:15.867
And I'm looking
around at this group.

05:15.970 --> 05:19.595

NARRATOR: And the redteam gets burdened with--

08:22.260 --> 08:23.054
Blueberries, Chef.

08:25.505 --> 08:26.298
Wow.

08:26.402 --> 08:27.541
There we have it.

08:27.645 --> 08:29.509
Now, get creative.

08:29.612 --> 08:31.511
I want to see some flair.

08:31.614 --> 08:34.341
We'd need hallucinogensto make a dish with that.

08:34.444 --> 08:39.035
Your 40 minutes starts now.

08:39.139 --> 08:40.243
NARRATOR: In today's challenge--

08:40.347 --> 08:41.935

08:44.109 --> 08:46.111
with their own
protein in addition

08:46.215 --> 08:47.872
to the seven shared
ingredients that they

08:47.975 --> 08:49.667
are all required to use.

08:49.770 --> 08:51.185
Get that rice on, guys.

08:51.289 --> 08:52.946
So a couple of things youcan do with the cherries.

08:53.049 --> 08:54.534
You can cook them in a balsamic.

08:54.637 --> 08:55.604
You can pickle them.

08:55.707 --> 08:56.674
Oh, I know what I'm gonna do.

08:56.777 --> 08:57.778
Come on, ladies.

08:57.882 --> 08:58.883
We got this.

08:58.986 --> 09:00.954
Guys, is everyone feeling OK?

09:01.057 --> 09:02.231
I'm not feeling OK.

09:02.334 --> 09:04.992
I'm allergic to peanut butter.

09:05.096 --> 09:07.857
I'm going to need help becausethere's just no way I can try

09:07.961 --> 09:09.756
my sauce with a peanut butter.

09:09.859 --> 09:10.722
What protein do you have?

09:10.826 --> 09:12.068
Halibut.

09:12.172 --> 09:14.415
On top of that, I have topair a peanut butter with fish.

09:14.519 --> 09:16.003
Could one your
teammates help you out

09:16.107 --> 09:17.418
with that element of your dish.

09:17.522 --> 09:20.421
I'm figure-- I'll find it.

09:20.525 --> 09:22.734
Hell, yeah, I'm a genius.

09:22.838 --> 09:24.046
What are you making?

09:24.149 --> 09:28.913
I'm doing a black cod witha cherry syrup gastrique.

09:29.016 --> 09:33.227
My dishes ride that line thaton this side, you're a genius,

09:33.331 --> 09:35.298
and on this side, you're crazy.

09:35.402 --> 09:37.197
[laughs]

09:37.300 --> 09:38.923
20 minutes remaining.

09:39.026 --> 09:41.097
Ladies, I want you incorporatingall seven ingredients.

09:41.201 --> 09:42.478
Yes, Chef.

09:42.582 --> 09:44.273
Good.

09:44.376 --> 09:45.170
Does this need more salt?

09:49.416 --> 09:51.314
I have a bad dry mouth.

09:51.418 --> 09:52.384
I can't, like--

09:52.488 --> 09:54.352
Robyn always chokes
during challenges.

09:54.455 --> 09:56.354
So as much as we
both want to win,

09:56.457 --> 09:57.907
I don't want to
give her some advice

09:58.011 --> 09:59.599
and then blame me when
it doesn't taste good.

09:59.702 --> 10:01.980
So I'm going to
focus on my own dish.

10:02.084 --> 10:03.844
Two minutes remaining.

10:03.948 --> 10:05.535
Guys, make sure if you'recooking artichokes,

10:05.639 --> 10:06.606
they're getting cooked.

10:06.709 --> 10:08.055
Don't overcook
your cod, Robyn.

10:08.159 --> 10:09.367
Well, it's still not cooked.

10:09.470 --> 10:10.437
Show some finesse, guys, yeah/

10:10.540 --> 10:11.334
Yes, Chef.

10:11.438 --> 10:12.232
My sauce is done.

10:12.335 --> 10:13.129
Can you taste my sauce?

10:13.233 --> 10:14.786
Sure.

10:14.890 --> 10:15.684
That's good.

10:15.787 --> 10:16.685
It's delicious.

10:16.788 --> 10:17.824
30 seconds remaining.

10:17.927 --> 10:19.446
- Come on, ladies.
- Y'all plating?

10:19.549 --> 10:20.792
Everything on the plate.

10:20.896 --> 10:31.423
GORDON RAMSAY: 10, 9, 8, 7,6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, and serve.

10:31.527 --> 10:32.839
Well done.

10:32.942 --> 10:34.426
Wow.
Time flies, right?

10:34.530 --> 10:35.462
Yes, Chef.

10:35.565 --> 10:37.878
I'm going to begin
with the red team.

10:37.982 --> 10:38.776
Barbie, let's go.

10:39.846 --> 10:40.640
Come on, Barbie.

10:40.743 --> 10:41.986
You got this, Barbie.

10:42.089 --> 10:45.161
NARRATOR: Each dish will bescored on a scale of 1 to 5.

10:45.265 --> 10:47.267
And the team with the
highest point total

10:47.370 --> 10:48.613
will win the challenge.

10:48.717 --> 10:50.926
Describe your dish, please.

10:51.029 --> 10:54.550
I made a pan-seared halibutwith an African peanut sauce,

10:54.654 --> 10:55.482
Chef.

10:55.585 --> 10:56.794
But I'm allergic to peanuts.So--

10:56.897 --> 10:57.760
So you haven't tasted this?

10:57.864 --> 10:58.658
No, Chef.

10:58.761 --> 10:59.659
But my team helped me.

10:59.762 --> 11:00.556
GORDON RAMSAY: Right.

11:04.940 --> 11:06.113
Mmm.

11:06.217 --> 11:07.287
You've nailed the fish.

11:07.390 --> 11:09.392
Peanut butterincorporated is delicious.

11:09.496 --> 11:11.153
That is a 4 out of 5.

11:11.256 --> 11:12.085
Good job.

11:12.188 --> 11:13.811
Good job, Barbie.

11:13.914 --> 11:16.089
BARBIE: I think that if I'dbeen able to taste my dish,

11:16.192 --> 11:17.849
I would've gotten a 5 out of 5.

11:17.953 --> 11:19.609
But I'm really proud of it.

11:19.713 --> 11:20.576
Really good start.

11:20.680 --> 11:21.473
Good job.

11:21.577 --> 11:22.543
Manda, let's go.

11:22.647 --> 11:23.855
NARRATOR: Now,
it's Manda's turn.

11:23.959 --> 11:26.616
And she is hoping to scorebig points with her rib cap

11:26.720 --> 11:28.273
and cantaloupe infused rice.

11:28.377 --> 11:30.172
The rice is bland.

11:30.275 --> 11:31.518
Damn.
That sucks.

11:31.621 --> 11:32.484
That does suck.

11:32.588 --> 11:33.969
That's a 2.

11:34.072 --> 11:34.901
Sorry, Chef.

11:35.004 --> 11:35.833
It's OK.

11:35.936 --> 11:38.042
[applause]

11:38.145 --> 11:38.939
Dana, let's go.

11:39.043 --> 11:41.183
Come on, Dana.

11:41.286 --> 11:43.081
NARRATOR: After
Manda's misstep, Dana

11:43.185 --> 11:45.359
is in the spotlight with
her peanut butter lime

11:45.463 --> 11:47.154
rib-eye with
blueberry demi-glace.

11:47.258 --> 11:48.949
The steak, you've
nailed beautifully.

11:49.053 --> 11:50.502
That is a resounding 5.

11:50.606 --> 11:51.400
Thank you, Chef.

11:51.503 --> 11:52.297
GORDON RAMSAY: Great job.

11:52.401 --> 11:54.368
Good job, Dana.

12:00.098 --> 12:02.031
with a blueberry gastrique.

12:02.135 --> 12:03.964
ROBYN: I haven't been doingso good on challenges.

12:04.068 --> 12:06.208
So I definitely
need to bounce back.

12:06.311 --> 12:07.140
Come on, Chef Ramsay.

12:07.243 --> 12:09.073
5, 5, 5, 5, out of 5, 5, 5.

12:09.176 --> 12:11.800
So it looks like
someone's been shot.

12:11.903 --> 12:12.732
Oh,

12:12.835 --> 12:13.663
Oh, no.

12:16.597 --> 12:17.495
It's bland.

12:17.598 --> 12:18.945
And the skin is rubbery.

12:19.048 --> 12:19.842
Come on.

12:19.946 --> 12:21.844
I'm struggling to give that a 1.

12:21.948 --> 12:23.743
1 out of 5.

12:23.846 --> 12:26.746
Robyn gets a 1 again.

12:26.849 --> 12:28.092
[sighs]

12:28.195 --> 12:30.473
This is not looking
good for our team.

12:30.577 --> 12:32.786
NARRATOR: As Robyn's
fish tanks, Elise

12:32.890 --> 12:35.824
is under pressure to deliveron her wagyu strip steak

12:35.927 --> 12:37.135
to boost their total.

12:37.239 --> 12:38.481
I love what you've
done with the melon.

12:38.585 --> 12:39.586
You wrapped the asparagus.

12:39.689 --> 12:41.139
That is a definite 5 for 5.

12:41.243 --> 12:42.037
Thank you, Chef.

12:42.140 --> 12:43.038
[applause]

12:43.141 --> 12:44.798
Once again, slamdunk.

12:44.902 --> 12:46.524
That 5 is all me, baby.

12:46.627 --> 12:48.491
NARRATOR: Next,
Michelle hopes her filet

12:48.595 --> 12:49.907

12:50.010 --> 12:51.598
I love what you've donewith that salty sweetness

12:51.701 --> 12:52.806
in the melon.

12:52.910 --> 12:54.635
NARRATOR: --can continuethe red team's hot streak.

12:54.739 --> 12:55.705
That's a 5 for 5.

12:55.809 --> 12:56.603
Thank you, Chef.

12:56.706 --> 12:57.673
[cheering]

12:57.777 --> 12:59.157
Yes!

12:59.261 --> 13:01.366
Jennifer, last for the reds.

13:01.470 --> 13:02.747
Describe the dish, please.

13:02.851 --> 13:07.200
It's peanut butter friedmonkfish with saffron risotto.

13:07.303 --> 13:08.304
That is cooked beautifully.

13:08.408 --> 13:09.409
Can you all see how
glistening that is?

13:09.512 --> 13:10.444
Yes, Chef.

13:10.548 --> 13:11.549
- A very strong 4.
- Thank you, Chef.

13:11.652 --> 13:12.861
- Good job.
- Good job, Jennifer.

13:12.964 --> 13:14.241
A really good job.

13:14.345 --> 13:15.656
Good job.

13:15.760 --> 13:18.418
Ladies, your total, 26.

13:18.521 --> 13:19.937
That's a strong effort.

13:20.040 --> 13:22.146
Right, Milly, starting
off for the blue team.

13:22.249 --> 13:25.218
If the red team could
get 26, I'm guaranteeing

13:25.321 --> 13:26.495
we're getting a 30.

13:26.598 --> 13:30.326
I have a brown butter
and baking fat monkfish,

13:30.430 --> 13:33.329
garnished with grilled
maraschino cherries.

13:33.433 --> 13:38.369
It doesn't look
that intriguing.

13:38.472 --> 13:40.785
But the actual flavor is good.

13:40.889 --> 13:41.682
It's a good 3.

13:41.786 --> 13:42.580
Thank you, Chef.

13:42.683 --> 13:43.926
Thank you.

13:44.030 --> 13:46.170
Great start.

13:46.273 --> 13:48.448
NARRATOR: Next stop, Vanhopes his filet with syrup

13:48.551 --> 13:51.209
and cherry sauce cancontinue to close the gap.

13:51.313 --> 13:52.590
The filet you nailed.

13:52.693 --> 13:56.283
But there's so much cherry onthat, it's just very sweet.

13:56.387 --> 13:57.181
3 out of 5, Van.

13:57.284 --> 13:58.147
[applause]

13:58.251 --> 14:00.632
Damn.

14:00.736 --> 14:03.773
NARRATOR: Benjamin's wagyu stripsteak with a maple bacon glaze

14:03.877 --> 14:06.846
will need to impress to matchthe perfect score that Elise

14:06.949 --> 14:08.123
received with her wagyu.

14:08.226 --> 14:09.055
Really beautiful.

14:09.158 --> 14:10.366
The glaze, there's
that earthiness.

14:10.470 --> 14:11.851
It just lightens everything up.

14:11.954 --> 14:13.266
That is a definite 5 for 5.

14:13.369 --> 14:15.958
Thank you, Chef.

14:16.062 --> 14:17.857
Getting a 5 is
the best, you know?

14:17.960 --> 14:19.859
That's what I do.

14:19.962 --> 14:22.068
NARRATOR: It's now up toJared's black cod with roasted

14:22.171 --> 14:24.725
cauliflower to keep
the blue team afloat.

14:24.829 --> 14:26.037
JARED: Man, I'm proud of this.

14:26.141 --> 14:28.695
This turned out exactlylike I thought it should.

14:28.798 --> 14:30.939
So I think the
bizarre thing with this

14:31.042 --> 14:35.115
is the cauliflower tastesbetter than your protein.

14:35.219 --> 14:36.220
Yes, Chef.

14:36.323 --> 14:38.394
GORDON RAMSAY: This
is 1 out of 5, Jared.

14:38.498 --> 14:39.706
Come on, bro.

14:39.809 --> 14:40.845
A 1?

14:40.949 --> 14:42.467
You're better than a 1, man.

14:42.571 --> 14:44.090
We can't win like this.

14:44.193 --> 14:45.885
GORDON RAMSAY: Nick,
let's go, please.

14:45.988 --> 14:47.990
NARRATOR: After Jared's
failure with fish,

14:48.094 --> 14:50.303
Nick will need to score
big with his rib-eye

14:50.406 --> 14:52.546
and golden raisintapenade for the blue team

14:52.650 --> 14:54.134
to have a chance of winning.

14:54.238 --> 14:56.102
This dish is inspired
by my husband because we

14:56.205 --> 14:57.966
always eat rib-eyes at home.

14:58.069 --> 14:59.657
Yeah, I can see
why he married you.

14:59.760 --> 15:01.383
5 for 5, young man.
- Thank you.

15:01.486 --> 15:02.315
Thank you.

15:02.418 --> 15:04.455
[applause]

15:04.558 --> 15:05.974

15:06.077 --> 15:07.389
Next up.
Josh, please.

15:07.492 --> 15:08.286
JOSH: We're 8 points down.

15:08.390 --> 15:09.701
There's two of us left.

15:09.805 --> 15:11.876
And I'm confident my dish haswhat it takes to help us win.

15:11.980 --> 15:13.050
Describe that, please.

15:13.153 --> 15:14.189
That is a bacon
wrapped halibut,

15:14.292 --> 15:16.087
Chef, that I basted with thyme.

15:16.191 --> 15:17.399
GORDON RAMSAY:
Visually, it's textbook.

15:17.502 --> 15:20.816
It looks like it's just cameoff the cover of a book.

15:20.920 --> 15:24.164
I'm like, please don'ttastes as good as it looks.

15:24.268 --> 15:25.890
The fish is overcooked.

15:25.994 --> 15:27.719
Yes, Chef.

15:27.823 --> 15:29.687
It's a 3 out of 5.

15:31.620 --> 15:32.759
So close.

15:32.862 --> 15:35.072
Gio, all the pressure on you.

15:35.175 --> 15:37.557
NARRATOR: As this is the
blue team's final dish,

I rendered the bacon.

15:45.185 --> 15:46.152
I sauteed it

15:46.255 --> 15:47.256
Temperature-wise,
what were you going for?

15:48.326 --> 15:50.708
Medium rare.

NARRATOR: It's down to thefinal dish of the letter

16:21.808 --> 16:23.120
NARRATOR: And if
Giovanni receives

16:23.223 --> 16:25.639
anything less than a
perfect score of 5,

16:25.743 --> 16:27.227
the red team will win.

16:27.331 --> 16:33.820

is a 4 out of 5.

16:33.923 --> 16:36.650

16:45.625 --> 16:46.833
Not losing today.

16:46.936 --> 16:48.697
Our confidence
needed to get boosted,

16:48.800 --> 16:50.181
up our morale a little bit.

16:50.285 --> 16:51.734
And we are so stoked.

recycling hundreds

17:47.721 --> 17:49.102

17:49.206 --> 17:51.553
Everything needs to
go in the proper bins.

17:51.656 --> 17:52.485
It's going to be smelly.

17:52.588 --> 17:54.142
It's going to be dirty.
Regroup.

26:21.131 --> 26:22.166
I don't know what's
wrong with you?

26:22.270 --> 26:23.443
No, I understand, Chef.
I made too much risotto.

26:23.547 --> 26:24.341
You made too much?

26:24.444 --> 26:25.480
Get a grip.

26:25.584 --> 26:26.688
Yes, Chef.

26:26.792 --> 26:28.241
NARRATOR: Even though Joshis making his job harder

26:28.345 --> 26:30.589
by delivering morerisottos than are needed,

26:30.692 --> 26:33.764
the blue team is steadily
delivering appetizers,

26:33.868 --> 26:35.594
while in the red
kitchen, Michelle

26:35.697 --> 26:39.114
and Elise are attempting tokeep pace with their appetizers.

26:39.218 --> 26:41.392
I'm, like, 30 seconds outon this, the two risottos.

26:41.496 --> 26:42.428
OK, I'm walking with
two orders of scallops.

26:42.531 --> 26:43.325
All right.

26:44.844 --> 26:45.604
Taste it.

26:54.233 --> 26:55.683
All of you, grab a spoon.

26:55.786 --> 26:57.374
Motherfucker.

26:57.477 --> 26:58.720
What does that reek of?

26:58.824 --> 27:00.480
It's raw and garlic.

27:00.584 --> 27:01.585
Garlic first.

27:01.689 --> 27:03.518
Raw rice.

27:03.622 --> 27:05.727
Shit.

27:05.831 --> 27:07.522
I'm pissed off at
Michelle right now

27:07.626 --> 27:08.972
because she's such a good cook.

27:09.075 --> 27:10.490
I don't understand
why she's doing this.

27:10.594 --> 27:11.733
This isn't looking
good right now

27:11.837 --> 27:12.734
That looks better, right?

27:12.838 --> 27:14.425
Yes.

27:14.529 --> 27:15.323
Taste.

27:15.426 --> 27:16.255
Taste before you go.

27:16.358 --> 27:19.430
I'm walking with two risottos.

27:19.534 --> 27:20.328
Thank you.

27:20.431 --> 27:21.225
You're welcome.

27:21.329 --> 27:22.675
Thank you, Chef.

27:22.779 --> 27:23.711
It better not fucking come back.

27:27.473 --> 27:28.336
Hey.

27:28.439 --> 27:29.440
A delicious risotto.

27:29.544 --> 27:31.373
But why wasn't that
like that first off?

27:31.477 --> 27:32.927
Why can't you do that
first time round?

27:33.030 --> 27:35.412
It'll be like that
from now on out, Chef.

27:35.515 --> 27:37.000
On order, two
risottos, two scallops.

27:37.103 --> 27:38.242
Risotto, how long?

27:38.346 --> 27:39.416
I have three--

27:39.519 --> 27:40.451
5 and 1/2 minutes, Chef.

27:40.555 --> 27:41.867

27:43.385 --> 27:44.041
Come on.
Up there.

27:44.145 --> 27:45.456
Let's go.

27:45.560 --> 27:48.528
There's no reason that youlook at your fucking stopwatch

27:48.632 --> 27:50.082
so you could time risotto.

27:50.185 --> 27:51.255
Like, that's stupid.

27:51.359 --> 27:52.601
Risotto, how long?

27:52.705 --> 27:53.499
Yes, Chef.

27:53.602 --> 27:54.396
Can you just count?

27:54.500 --> 27:55.328
People look at that.

27:55.432 --> 27:56.329
Oh, fuck.

27:56.433 --> 27:57.606
Look at your fucking
dish, you dick!

27:57.710 --> 27:58.849
Yes, Chef.

27:58.953 --> 27:59.816

27:59.919 --> 28:00.644

28:00.748 --> 28:02.128
I'll take it off.

28:02.232 --> 28:03.509
Fuck's sake.

28:03.612 --> 28:04.406
Piece of shit.

28:04.510 --> 28:06.201
Fuck.

28:06.305 --> 28:07.513
MILLY: Yeah.

28:07.616 --> 28:10.205
Chef Ramsay threw thatmotherfucker in the pizza oven.

28:10.309 --> 28:14.554
And you know, we had anew special for the night.

28:14.658 --> 28:16.556
Did you ask for
two risotto, Chef?

28:16.660 --> 28:18.869
This guy can't fucking count.

28:18.973 --> 28:19.767
Fucking extraordinary.

28:19.870 --> 28:20.699
VAN: What was that?

28:20.802 --> 28:24.081
GORDON RAMSAY: What the fuck?

28:24.185 --> 28:25.911

28:35.092 --> 28:36.507

28:36.611 --> 28:38.958
How screwed up is this?

28:40.201 --> 28:41.443
Hey.

You sit down with Paige.

28:42.997 --> 28:43.998
Sit down with Paige.

28:44.101 --> 28:44.895
You've made enough.

28:44.999 --> 28:46.552
Go on.

28:46.655 --> 28:48.450
This is what
humiliation looks like.

28:48.554 --> 28:49.348
Oh, what you did wrong?

28:49.451 --> 28:50.349
But I couldn't--

28:50.452 --> 28:51.384
Sorry.

28:51.488 --> 28:53.214
I don't like waste, Paige.

28:53.317 --> 28:54.594

Hurry up.

28:54.698 --> 28:55.872
- Excuse me.
- All of it?

28:55.975 --> 28:56.769
I guess so.

28:56.873 --> 28:57.977
At least it's delicious.

28:58.081 --> 28:59.013
[laughs]

29:00.186 --> 29:00.980
Come on, man.

29:01.084 --> 29:02.085
That ain't no punishment.

29:02.188 --> 29:03.811
- You're awesome, by the way.- Thank you.

29:03.914 --> 29:04.743

Best day of my life.

29:17.721 --> 29:18.895

Thank you.

29:20.828 --> 29:22.553
Thanks for the fun.

29:22.657 --> 29:24.521
Aw, poor guy.

29:24.624 --> 29:27.386
Van, can you put some ofthat stock in that pot, please?

29:27.489 --> 29:28.490
Where?
Here?

29:29.181 --> 29:30.492
No.
- Here.

29:30.596 --> 29:31.770
- What are you doing, bro?- Here.

29:31.873 --> 29:32.909
Why'd you fucking say that?

29:35.049 --> 29:35.670
Hey.

29:35.774 --> 29:37.327
[music playing]

29:41.331 --> 29:43.436

29:54.413 --> 29:55.310
Hey.

29:55.414 --> 29:56.415
I'll go over to
help you, and you're

29:56.518 --> 29:57.519
acting like a little
bitch right now, Josh.

29:57.623 --> 29:58.969
You don't have
to get that crazy.

29:59.073 --> 29:59.867
Two duck, two halibut.

29:59.970 --> 30:01.109
Where are we?

30:01.213 --> 30:02.386
- I'm waiting for garnish, Chef.- Oh, fucking hell.

30:02.490 --> 30:03.560
I'm garnishing
right now, Chef.

30:03.663 --> 30:05.700
We're slowing
down for garnish.

30:05.804 --> 30:08.220
Barbie seems flustered onthe garnish station, you know,

30:08.323 --> 30:10.601
where you, like, reheat stuff.

30:10.705 --> 30:11.671
- Barbie walking two duck?- No.

30:11.775 --> 30:12.983
Wait.

What do you mean, wait?

30:14.088 --> 30:15.158
GORDON RAMSAY: Two
duck, two halibut.

30:15.261 --> 30:17.125
Duck.

30:17.229 --> 30:18.195
Halibut garnish.

30:18.299 --> 30:21.026
I'm working on halibut
garnish right now.

30:21.129 --> 30:21.923
Come on.

30:22.027 --> 30:22.924
Yes, Chef.

30:23.028 --> 30:24.477
Why is Barbie
struggling with garnish?

30:28.688 --> 30:30.345
Ice cold mash.
- Sorry, Chef.

30:30.449 --> 30:31.415
Ice cold!

30:31.519 --> 30:33.348
Hey, can I have my

30:33.452 --> 30:34.556
My glove, you donut.

30:34.660 --> 30:35.454
Oh, sorry.

30:35.557 --> 30:36.904
Fucking hell.

30:37.007 --> 30:40.079
I guess if you bring coldmash up to Chef Ramsay,

30:40.183 --> 30:42.081
he's going to call you a donut.

30:42.185 --> 30:44.221
That's funny, donut.

Whoa, whoa, I thinkeverything got us kicked out,

36:18.348 --> 36:19.142
Yeah.

36:19.246 --> 36:20.143

36:22.214 --> 36:23.077
No.

36:23.181 --> 36:24.458
You got me twisted, man.

36:24.561 --> 36:28.151

36:33.777 --> 36:36.194

36:38.057 --> 36:39.921
He was slowing down
service all night.

36:40.025 --> 36:41.475
You had, like,
11 extra risottos.

36:41.578 --> 36:44.512
So you're saying that 11extra risottos is worse than not

36:44.616 --> 36:45.410
knowing how to cook meat?

36:46.445 --> 36:47.584
Yes.

36:47.688 --> 36:49.137
JOSH: If you can't cookmeat, you shouldn't be here.

36:49.241 --> 36:50.725

36:50.829 --> 36:53.349
But listen, I didn't do anythingto get you guys kicked out.

36:53.452 --> 36:54.453

And Jared should be up there.

37:55.169 --> 37:58.310
Put us through and take
that chef jacket off.

37:58.414 --> 38:01.693
I say we do two
people and move on.

38:01.796 --> 38:03.108
Josh and Benjamin.

38:03.211 --> 38:04.558
I got the same thing.

38:04.661 --> 38:05.697
Josh and Benjamin.

38:06.939 --> 38:08.078
Josh and Gio.

38:08.182 --> 38:09.459
Gio and Ben.

38:09.563 --> 38:10.736
Josh and Gio.

38:10.840 --> 38:11.910
Listen.

38:12.013 --> 38:13.291
It's gonna be Josh and
either Gio and Benjamin.

38:13.394 --> 38:14.326
So let's break the tie.

38:19.814 --> 38:22.645
[music playing]

38:29.134 --> 38:33.380
Tonight was a disaster.

38:33.483 --> 38:35.968
Milly, blue team's
first nominee and why.

38:36.072 --> 38:39.386
Our first nominee
is Josh, Chef.

38:39.489 --> 38:40.525
Josh?

38:40.628 --> 38:41.664
Yes, Chef.

38:41.767 --> 38:43.355
Because he kept making
the same mistake over

38:43.459 --> 38:45.978
and over again on the risotto.

38:46.082 --> 38:48.049
Wow.

38:48.153 --> 38:50.673
Blue team's second
nominee and why.

38:50.776 --> 38:51.812
Our second nominee is--

38:51.915 --> 38:54.262
[suspenseful music]

39:00.130 --> 39:03.927
[music playing]

39:04.031 --> 39:06.413
NARRATOR: For the first timesince the competition began,

39:06.516 --> 39:09.347
the blue team all stars
had a bad service.

39:09.450 --> 39:10.658
Their first nominee was--

39:10.762 --> 39:11.521
Josh, Chef.

39:14.179 --> 39:15.422
Wow.

39:15.525 --> 39:18.148
Blue team's second
nominee and why.

39:18.252 --> 39:23.775
Our second
nominee is Giovanni.

39:23.878 --> 39:24.879
Giovanni?

39:24.983 --> 39:27.054
Yes, Chef.

39:27.157 --> 39:28.296
Why?

39:28.400 --> 39:29.919
It was mistakes, whoevermade the most mistakes,

39:30.022 --> 39:32.059
and it was Giovanni.

39:32.162 --> 39:33.819
Josh, Gio, step forward.

39:38.341 --> 39:41.758
Gio, why do you think youshould stay in Hell's Kitchen?

39:41.862 --> 39:43.173
I think I should
stay in Hell's Kitchen,

39:43.277 --> 39:45.141
Chef, because I never madethe same mistake twice.

39:45.244 --> 39:46.280
I've had two good services.

39:46.384 --> 39:47.695
I know I should have
known better because I

39:47.799 --> 39:49.801
am the senior guy here.

39:49.904 --> 39:51.975
But I never quit.

39:52.079 --> 39:54.495
Josh, tell me why shouldyou stay in Hell's Kitchen.

39:54.599 --> 39:56.946
Chef, I have a lot
of passion and love

39:57.049 --> 39:58.050
for what I'm doing here.

39:58.154 --> 39:59.017
And I really want to be here.

39:59.120 --> 40:00.398
I deserve to be here, Chef.

40:00.501 --> 40:02.192
And I will give you the verybest each and every moment

40:02.296 --> 40:05.230
that I'm kept here, Chef.

40:05.333 --> 40:06.162
Yes, Benjamin.

40:06.265 --> 40:07.266
Chef, throughout
the whole day,

40:07.370 --> 40:08.854
we've been watching
over Josh, and he's

40:08.958 --> 40:11.270
been the weakest link all day.

40:11.374 --> 40:12.651
I disagree.

40:12.755 --> 40:15.171
All those who
believe that they

40:15.274 --> 40:17.725
are carrying Josh on theblue team, raise their hands.

40:20.314 --> 40:21.108
What?

40:24.076 --> 40:24.870
My decision is--

40:24.974 --> 40:27.770
[intense music]

40:32.671 --> 40:34.708
Josh, give me your jacket.

40:34.811 --> 40:35.640
Yes, Chef.

40:39.747 --> 40:46.685
When a team gives up onyou, there is no place to go.

40:46.789 --> 40:47.617
Josh.

40:47.721 --> 40:50.448
Yes, Chef.

40:50.551 --> 40:51.966
You go to the red team.
[gasping]

40:52.070 --> 40:53.036
No.

40:53.140 --> 40:56.212
Robyn, get up and
give Josh your seat.

40:57.351 --> 40:58.179
Oh, my gosh.

40:58.283 --> 41:01.562
Gio, back in line.

41:01.666 --> 41:04.427
Robyn, get in the blue team.

41:04.531 --> 41:06.015
- I'll miss you.
- Oh, my god.

41:06.118 --> 41:07.085
No.

41:07.188 --> 41:10.122
Listen and listen carefully.

41:10.226 --> 41:11.572
Oh, fuck.

41:11.676 --> 41:16.197
Josh and Robyn, I haven'tseen you at your best.

41:16.301 --> 41:19.028
And I'm willing to give
you one more chance.

41:19.131 --> 41:20.201
Yes, Chef.

41:20.305 --> 41:22.203
Both of you, you need
to perform at the level

41:22.307 --> 41:23.860
that you showed me when
you were here last.

41:23.964 --> 41:24.792
Is that clear?

41:24.896 --> 41:26.138
Yes, Chef.

41:26.242 --> 41:28.175
Get out of here.

41:28.278 --> 41:30.246
I'm going to the red team.

41:30.349 --> 41:31.350
This is no joke.

41:31.454 --> 41:33.387
These girls are a little
ruthless at times.

41:33.491 --> 41:34.595
But you know what?

41:34.699 --> 41:35.562
I'm going to make thebest of this opportunity.

41:35.665 --> 41:36.908
I'm going to hit
the ground running.

41:37.011 --> 41:38.703
I'm going to show
Chef Ramsay that I'm

41:38.806 --> 41:41.568
deserving of my second chance.

41:41.671 --> 41:43.328
Blue team all the
way, right here.

41:43.431 --> 41:44.847
I'm ready to take
the red jacket off.

41:44.950 --> 41:45.779
I'm here for a mission.

41:45.882 --> 41:47.505
I'm here to make myself better.

41:47.608 --> 41:49.368
I want to be that one
walking down the stairs.

41:49.472 --> 41:52.164
So I guess this is where
Chef wants me to be.

41:52.268 --> 41:54.891
Getting Josh out of
the blue chef jacket,

41:54.995 --> 41:56.583
that was our whole
thing tonight.

41:56.686 --> 41:57.687
Get rid of Josh.

41:57.791 --> 42:00.000
We ain't give a fuck
how we got rid of Josh.

42:00.103 --> 42:01.933
We ain't give a fuck if ChefRamsay threw them in the oven

42:02.036 --> 42:03.521
with that watch.
Boosh.

42:03.624 --> 42:04.418
Bye, Josh.

42:08.077 --> 42:10.148
NARRATOR: Next time on
"Hell's Kitchen," when

42:10.251 --> 42:12.184
the red team's newest member--

42:12.288 --> 42:14.186
I need to talk to
the red team, my team.

42:14.290 --> 42:16.050
NARRATOR: --gets the coldshoulder from Elise--

42:16.154 --> 42:17.845
Please can we go somewherewhere we can have a chat?

42:17.949 --> 42:18.743
The red team?

42:18.846 --> 42:19.813
I'm not ready to chat.

42:19.916 --> 42:21.435
He's been on the
team for 30 seconds.

42:21.539 --> 42:22.367
I don't think so.

42:22.470 --> 42:23.610
I'll tell you when
it's a meeting.

42:23.713 --> 42:24.783
And it ain't now.

42:24.887 --> 42:26.923
NARRATOR: --will he bejust the spark they need?

42:27.027 --> 42:28.649
They're going to have nochoice but to welcome me.

42:28.753 --> 42:30.064
Josh, delicious.

42:30.168 --> 42:32.377
JOSH: You can do that work withme or you can get out of here.

42:32.480 --> 42:34.241
NARRATOR: --to bring
down their tyrant.

42:34.344 --> 42:35.622
This is how the
red team works.

42:35.725 --> 42:37.865
Why do you bully everyone?

42:37.969 --> 42:39.004
I'm not a bully.

42:39.108 --> 42:40.281
And nobody on this team
would agree with you.

42:40.385 --> 42:42.352
Yes, you are.

42:42.456 --> 42:45.010
NARRATOR: Will getting calledout cause Elise freeze up?

42:45.114 --> 42:46.218
GORDON RAMSAY: I need the trays.

42:46.322 --> 42:47.219
Elise.

42:47.323 --> 42:48.496
Yo, what the fuck?

42:48.600 --> 42:50.429
She won't do anything.

42:50.533 --> 42:51.707
Elise, are you busy?

42:51.810 --> 42:52.880
NARRATOR: It's all next time--
