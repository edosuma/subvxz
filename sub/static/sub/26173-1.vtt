02:43.996 --> 02:45.198
We should go.

02:46.365 --> 02:48.367
How come everyone left so soon?

02:50.536 --> 02:52.305
They probably have things to do.

02:54.772 --> 02:56.508
There weren't that many people.

02:58.310 --> 03:01.911
Most of Grandpa's friends
are dead, sweetheart.

03:01.913 --> 03:02.948
Come on, let's go.

03:13.525 --> 03:14.625
All right,
these water rights

03:14.627 --> 03:16.596
have been in this family
since the 1800s.

03:18.430 --> 03:20.263
The old man himself
has owned them

03:20.265 --> 03:23.733
since, like, 1939.

03:23.735 --> 03:25.405
So it's gonna take
some persuasion.

03:26.805 --> 03:28.274
I want you guys to persuade him.

03:29.807 --> 03:30.842
You two know each other?

03:32.811 --> 03:34.810
I've seen him around.

03:34.812 --> 03:37.780
Had a friend who said he bought
a skimpy bag of weed from him.

03:37.782 --> 03:39.448
I don't sell skimpy bag.

03:39.450 --> 03:40.851
Had a bunch of stems in it.

03:40.853 --> 03:42.918
Oh, Jesus. All right, uh...

03:42.920 --> 03:45.721
Rainy, this is Jawari.
Jawari, Rainy.

03:45.723 --> 03:48.024
You think you guys
can work together?

03:48.026 --> 03:49.962
Hey, man, I'm a professional.

03:51.497 --> 03:53.630
All right, I need you
to loosen the guy up.

03:53.632 --> 03:55.666
He's old, all right?
Do not kill him.

03:55.668 --> 03:58.768
Just... Just get it done.
We need him to sign.

03:58.770 --> 04:00.336
When do you want this done?

04:00.338 --> 04:02.638
Let's do this tomorrow.
Around noon.

04:02.640 --> 04:05.574
You guys hold him there.
I'll come by with the papers.

04:05.576 --> 04:07.577
And what if he gives us trouble?

04:07.579 --> 04:09.446
What'd I just say, asshole?

04:09.448 --> 04:11.947
Do not kill him.
He can't sign if he's dead.

04:11.949 --> 04:13.850
I was just asking.

04:13.852 --> 04:15.388
Might have a shotgun
or something.

04:16.588 --> 04:18.522
He's in his 90s.

04:18.524 --> 04:20.723
Can you handle a guy in his 90s?

04:27.766 --> 04:29.335
Cheyenne, dinner's ready.

04:30.468 --> 04:32.836
James and Chris were
chasing me and Lucia.

04:32.838 --> 04:34.870
They said they were
going to toss us into the pond.

04:34.872 --> 04:36.539
Oh. Really?

04:36.541 --> 04:38.841
Well, we'll see about that.

04:38.843 --> 04:40.913
- What's that?
- It was on the door.

04:44.949 --> 04:45.985
Go wash up.

04:47.685 --> 04:48.854
What's for dinner?

04:50.822 --> 04:51.990
Vegetable soup.

04:55.560 --> 04:57.560
Hey, honey?

04:57.562 --> 04:59.663
What did you think
about the farm?

04:59.665 --> 05:00.867
It was okay.

05:01.600 --> 05:03.466
Just okay?

05:03.468 --> 05:05.668
Yeah, it was fun
just running around.

05:05.670 --> 05:07.339
There's lots of places to go.

05:11.509 --> 05:12.812
There's crackers
if you want some.

05:15.713 --> 05:20.384
So it turns out, Grandpa was a
bit of a hermit in his old age.

05:20.386 --> 05:23.022
We're probably the only family
he kept in contact with.

05:25.089 --> 05:26.825
He might leave me
something in his will.

05:27.892 --> 05:30.762
Really? Like what?

05:32.531 --> 05:33.665
Like, I don't know.

05:36.668 --> 05:39.906
Mr. Pendleton kind of hinted
he might leave me the farm.

05:41.639 --> 05:44.676
It's a lot more space
over there than in this trailer.

05:46.778 --> 05:48.014
Are you working tonight?

05:53.451 --> 05:54.950
Yes.

05:54.952 --> 05:56.088
Who's watching me?

05:57.021 --> 05:58.091
Lucia's mom.

06:00.826 --> 06:03.058
Don't let those boys
throw you in the pond.

06:03.060 --> 06:04.663
Please.

06:12.670 --> 06:13.836
Is Marty in his office?

06:13.838 --> 06:15.839
- Yeah.
- Okay.

06:15.841 --> 06:17.072
Would you like
some more coffee, sir?

06:17.074 --> 06:19.108
No, I'm fine, darling.
Thank you.

06:19.110 --> 06:20.747
I'll put this right over here.

06:24.983 --> 06:26.052
Have a good day.

06:42.166 --> 06:44.134
Got a minute?

06:44.136 --> 06:46.135
Yeah,
that's exactly what I've got.

06:46.137 --> 06:48.471
I'm tied up with this tax mess.

06:48.473 --> 06:49.908
I'm down to my last extension.

06:55.047 --> 06:56.983
I'm having
some hard times, financially.

06:57.915 --> 06:59.248
Boy, aren't we all?

06:59.250 --> 07:00.719
I need to make some extra money.

07:02.588 --> 07:04.187
Flirt with the customers.

07:04.189 --> 07:07.057
I'm not asking for a raise.
I'm just...

07:07.059 --> 07:09.625
Maybe you could
give me some extra hours.

07:09.627 --> 07:11.730
You're lucky to have
the hours you have now, Audrey.

07:12.997 --> 07:14.466
I got a kid, Marty.

07:15.266 --> 07:18.567
I had nothing to do with that,

07:18.569 --> 07:20.740
but maybe there is a solution.
You know, I'll uh...

07:21.839 --> 07:23.740
I'm really,
really tensed right now

07:23.742 --> 07:26.175
and you really need money.

07:26.177 --> 07:28.648
We're a match made in heaven.

07:36.855 --> 07:38.755
You owe me overtime pay.

07:38.757 --> 07:41.091
I told you, I'll pay you just
as soon as I get my tax refund.

07:41.093 --> 07:43.692
I know you have the money.
You just bought a brand-new car.

07:43.694 --> 07:45.464
Don't you tell me
how to spend my money.

07:46.163 --> 07:48.000
All right.

07:49.134 --> 07:51.700
I'm gonna pay your overtime.

07:51.702 --> 07:53.538
But you just have to wait
like everybody else.

07:55.874 --> 07:58.144
- Asshole.
- Nice mouth.

08:38.049 --> 08:39.347
You want beer?

08:39.350 --> 08:40.916
What the fuck is wrong with you?

08:40.918 --> 08:42.284
What? It's just beer.

08:42.287 --> 08:44.720
I'm talking about you carrying
them guns right out in the open.

08:44.722 --> 08:45.821
Man, nobody saw me.

08:45.823 --> 08:48.691
Besides, it's not a gun,
it's a rifle.

08:48.693 --> 08:51.264
You really think we need an
assault rifle for one old man?

08:52.264 --> 08:53.566
Here's your weapon.

08:56.268 --> 08:57.600
A six-shooter?

08:57.602 --> 08:59.736
It's a .38. That's respectable.

08:59.738 --> 09:01.204
How come I get a six-shooter

09:01.206 --> 09:03.373
like I'm some type of
fucking cowboy,

09:03.375 --> 09:05.175
and you get
a semi-automatic rifle?

09:05.177 --> 09:07.109
Yeah,
'cause that's all I've got.

09:07.111 --> 09:09.045
Besides, that was
my daddy's gun.

09:09.047 --> 09:11.082
Dan. You call your old man Dan?

09:13.184 --> 09:14.783
Man, what the fuck
is your problem, dude?

09:14.785 --> 09:16.288
I just thought we'd have
a beer together.

09:18.756 --> 09:20.290
Where's the bullets?

09:20.292 --> 09:21.994
Here, man,
I got your bullets right here.

09:25.263 --> 09:26.863
Six bullets is all I get?

09:26.865 --> 09:29.031
That's a six-shooter.
How many you want?

09:29.033 --> 09:31.233
Besides, we're not
supposed to kill anybody anyway.

09:31.235 --> 09:32.237
Remember?

09:34.239 --> 09:36.309
Hey, man, you got any weed?

09:37.208 --> 09:38.474
It's all stems, man.

09:38.476 --> 09:41.978
Come on, man, you know
I was just kidding with you.

09:41.980 --> 09:44.750
Besides, I know your own
personal stash is the good shit.

09:46.083 --> 09:48.917
Oh, yeah.
That's what I'm talkin' about.

09:48.919 --> 09:50.021
Let me see that.

09:50.721 --> 09:52.254
Nice.

09:52.256 --> 09:54.192
There's a little stem right
there, but that's all right.

09:55.126 --> 09:57.060
Mr. Pendleton is an old friend.

09:57.062 --> 09:58.998
He's helping us
with Grandpa's estate.

10:00.231 --> 10:02.967
My, I never knew

10:03.999 --> 10:05.300
he had such a pretty
great granddaughter.

10:06.804 --> 10:08.405
Grandpa had an estate?

10:08.407 --> 10:11.974
Yes. He owned 80 acres.

10:11.976 --> 10:14.179
- That's a lot.
- Yes, it is.

10:15.714 --> 10:17.683
You have any plans for it
if he leaves it to you?

10:19.183 --> 10:21.217
It needs a lot of work.

10:21.219 --> 10:24.320
Probably couldn't sell it
for a lot.

10:24.322 --> 10:26.723
I was actually thinking,

10:26.725 --> 10:30.093
it might be cheaper for us
if we lived there.

10:30.095 --> 10:31.027
Hmm.

10:31.029 --> 10:33.997
Will won't be executed
for another week.

10:33.999 --> 10:37.202
So, we'll talk about
the specifics then.

10:39.370 --> 10:42.439
I was at the funeral.
I don't know if you saw me.

10:42.441 --> 10:45.474
I did. Thank you.
Thank you for the flowers.

10:45.476 --> 10:47.377
You know, I know your...

10:47.379 --> 10:50.814
I worked with your grandfather,
my very first job.

10:50.816 --> 10:52.281
We were just boys.

10:52.283 --> 10:53.949
I did not know that.

10:54.952 --> 10:57.822
Picking some of the best
sweet corn we ever ate.

10:59.457 --> 11:01.391
You know, the first time
I saw your mother,

11:01.393 --> 11:03.028
she was younger
than you are now.

11:03.729 --> 11:04.594
Really?

11:04.596 --> 11:07.432
And you know,
she ran away from me.

11:08.432 --> 11:09.431
Seriously?

11:09.433 --> 11:13.936
I came by for a visit
and she ran away from me.

11:13.938 --> 11:16.174
But they said you were
slow to warm up to people.

11:17.075 --> 11:19.408
First ten minutes, I caught you

11:19.410 --> 11:23.046
spying on me from around
the corner of the house.

11:23.048 --> 11:24.914
Another ten minutes,

11:24.916 --> 11:28.454
and you were offering me
a cup of pretend tea.

11:29.354 --> 11:31.253
By the time I left,

11:31.255 --> 11:32.756
you were hanging at my neck.

11:32.758 --> 11:33.989
They had to pull you off me.

11:33.991 --> 11:36.158
I guess
I warmed up to you finally.

11:36.160 --> 11:37.162
Yes, you did.

11:38.096 --> 11:39.398
You were a clever one, too.

11:41.032 --> 11:43.802
She used a coffee can lid
for a frisbee.

11:44.436 --> 11:45.469
Got it stuck on the roof.

11:45.471 --> 11:48.271
Well, she tied a rope
to a baseball mitten...

11:48.273 --> 11:50.406
Threw it up there.

11:50.408 --> 11:51.840
That...

11:51.842 --> 11:53.776
That sounds more like me.

11:53.778 --> 11:56.780
- Did she ever get it down?
- Yes, she did.

11:56.782 --> 11:58.013
She sure did.

12:00.284 --> 12:02.887
An answer has no purpose
without a problem, you know?

12:05.990 --> 12:07.326
There aren't always answers.

12:10.095 --> 12:13.530
Well, I think
a clever girl will find one.

12:13.532 --> 12:17.168
Sometimes, you just have to
repurpose a few things.

12:19.070 --> 12:20.105
If that doesn't work?

12:21.873 --> 12:23.439
Leave it to the wind.

12:23.441 --> 12:25.778
It'll eventually blow off
whatever's on the roof.

12:27.379 --> 12:29.115
But I'm a runner, remember?

12:32.283 --> 12:33.451
But you come back.

12:40.292 --> 12:41.994
Thank you.

12:46.230 --> 12:47.232
Cheyenne.

12:49.234 --> 12:52.068
I'm sorry I didn't
say anything about it before,

12:52.070 --> 12:53.773
but it's not set in stone.

12:56.140 --> 12:57.840
What about school?

12:57.842 --> 12:59.477
Will I still go
to the same school?

13:00.846 --> 13:01.911
No.

13:01.913 --> 13:03.946
What about all my friends?

13:03.948 --> 13:06.348
Honey, I don't know
what's gonna happen.

13:06.350 --> 13:09.319
All I know is that we can't
afford the rent anymore.

13:09.321 --> 13:12.421
What about Dad?
Can we ask him to help us?

13:12.423 --> 13:14.492
Your dad doesn't
give us any money.

13:18.596 --> 13:21.564
If he knew we might
lose our home, then he might.

13:21.566 --> 13:24.233
All he would do is
try to take you away from me.

13:24.235 --> 13:26.201
Is that what you want? Hmm?

13:26.203 --> 13:27.572
You wanna live with your dad?

13:28.874 --> 13:30.576
You'll still have to
change schools.

13:36.981 --> 13:39.851
I know the birthday cards
from dad are really from you.

13:44.089 --> 13:46.289
How do you know that?

13:46.291 --> 13:48.927
No postage stamps
or return address.

13:50.961 --> 13:53.329
So you can't threaten me
with living with Dad.

13:53.331 --> 13:55.433
'Cause I already know
he wouldn't take me.

13:59.203 --> 14:01.005
You're pretty smart.
You know that?

14:01.605 --> 14:02.906
Yes.

14:04.509 --> 14:07.276
Just don't get a bumper sticker
on the car about it.

14:17.221 --> 14:18.356
What's your name, darlin'?

14:19.691 --> 14:20.926
Notta.

14:21.225 --> 14:22.327
Notta.

14:23.094 --> 14:25.129
- Is that Mexican?
- No.

14:25.629 --> 14:26.966
Notta what?

14:27.532 --> 14:28.998
Not a Chance.

14:32.070 --> 14:33.439
You got bird shit
on your window.

14:34.940 --> 14:36.975
Yeah? Why don't you
lick it off for me then?

14:38.143 --> 14:39.709
You think I won't?

14:39.711 --> 14:42.347
I'll give you ten bucks
if you lick that bird shit off.

14:44.215 --> 14:46.185
Come on, man.
The light turned green.

14:47.719 --> 14:49.254
Bitch, you even got ten bucks?

14:54.392 --> 14:55.494
I don't think you'll do it.

15:03.301 --> 15:04.470
Where's my money?

15:07.504 --> 15:08.974
I'll take the rest of it, too.

15:11.442 --> 15:13.075
What're you doing, man?

15:13.077 --> 15:14.178
Let's get out of here.

15:16.981 --> 15:18.482
Remember, I got your address.

15:18.484 --> 15:20.953
If you call the police, you better
hope they find me before I find you.

15:24.556 --> 15:26.025
All right,
coming through.

15:28.092 --> 15:31.194
Hey. There we go.

15:31.196 --> 15:34.497
That is the first time
you haven't hit fucking chair.

15:34.499 --> 15:37.099
I know.
You got me.

15:37.101 --> 15:38.703
That'll be all right.

15:40.739 --> 15:42.408
There.

15:43.541 --> 15:45.108
All right.

15:45.110 --> 15:46.608
You're getting better.
You're getting better.

15:46.610 --> 15:50.113
Hey. Put it over my feet.
My feet get cold.

15:50.115 --> 15:52.647
- Okay.
- No, the feet are down here, sir.

15:52.649 --> 15:53.651
There you go.

16:02.726 --> 16:03.962
So, uh...

16:05.296 --> 16:07.463
This afternoon I'm gonna
go see the old man.

16:07.465 --> 16:09.265
God.

16:09.267 --> 16:12.371
I stopped worrying about
that old bastard

16:13.437 --> 16:14.673
about 30 years ago.

16:16.206 --> 16:17.543
We hated each other.

16:19.711 --> 16:21.447
But respected each other.

16:23.048 --> 16:24.546
Yeah.

16:24.548 --> 16:26.581
Well, you could
never get him to sell.

16:26.583 --> 16:28.251
Dad could never get him to sell.

16:28.253 --> 16:30.689
You trying to tell me, you
wanna end up like your dad?

16:31.489 --> 16:32.454
I don't. I don't.

16:32.456 --> 16:35.291
You don't want that
and I don't want that.

16:35.293 --> 16:38.261
No, I don't. I just wanna show
you that I can run the business.

16:38.263 --> 16:39.264
I'm good.

16:41.765 --> 16:43.134
What are you gonna do?

16:44.269 --> 16:45.504
You know what we did in my day?

16:46.804 --> 16:49.204
If we didn't like somebody,

16:49.206 --> 16:51.342
we told them
right to their face,

16:52.476 --> 16:55.047
before you
loosen their jaw for them.

16:56.480 --> 17:00.516
And then they'd take a chair
and crack it over your head,

17:00.518 --> 17:02.053
if they had any guts.

17:03.354 --> 17:05.220
That's the problem today, Bobby.

17:06.589 --> 17:08.459
Nobody respects guts anymore.

17:12.195 --> 17:14.162
I wanna make you proud of me.

17:14.164 --> 17:17.566
You can proud
of one thing for sure.

17:17.568 --> 17:20.202
- What's that?
- Today,

17:20.204 --> 17:25.107
you were number one in the world
at hauling me off the shitter.

17:25.108 --> 17:27.612
It seems weird Bobby would go through
all this trouble for some water.

17:29.247 --> 17:31.150
He's just tryin' to
impress his grandfather.

17:38.756 --> 17:41.190
Do you have to carry that
out in the open like that?

17:41.192 --> 17:42.757
Hey, you know, maybe I'll
stick it down my pants.

17:42.759 --> 17:44.430
No one will see it
next to my dick.

17:45.563 --> 17:47.330
Hey, where's yours?

17:47.332 --> 17:49.498
If it was up your ass,
I bet you'd know where it was.

17:49.500 --> 17:51.366
Ooh, damn, brother.

17:51.368 --> 17:53.201
What spoiled your taco?

17:53.203 --> 17:55.337
Fuck you, man.

17:55.339 --> 17:58.274
Hey. Hey, so how long did
it take you to smear that,

17:58.276 --> 17:59.909
that doodle across your lip?
Huh?

17:59.911 --> 18:02.511
Shit, I shave twice a day, man.

18:08.385 --> 18:11.487
Man, if you shave twice a day,
I shit gold bricks.

18:11.489 --> 18:12.654
You can hardly tickle
a twat

18:12.656 --> 18:14.724
with that
Velcro-looking thing.

18:14.726 --> 18:16.459
Kiss my ass, cowboy.

18:16.461 --> 18:18.794
I get more pussy
than you come at.

18:18.796 --> 18:20.496
Ooh, well, well, well.

18:20.498 --> 18:21.796
If we're talking about
imaginary pussy,

18:21.798 --> 18:23.699
then I guess you're gonna win.

18:23.701 --> 18:24.803
I know you're in there!

18:26.703 --> 18:28.371
Hey!

18:28.373 --> 18:30.442
You ain't
fooling anyone, old man.

18:31.175 --> 18:32.443
We know you're in there!

18:34.378 --> 18:35.513
I don't think he's in there.

18:42.686 --> 18:44.822
I know he's around here somewhere.
He's gotta be.

18:45.557 --> 18:46.557
We'll find him.

19:02.307 --> 19:04.440
You check the woods
on that side,

19:04.442 --> 19:05.740
I'll come up behind the barn

19:05.742 --> 19:07.876
and we'll meet up
by that wood pile.

19:07.878 --> 19:09.514
Man, I fucking hate trees.

19:10.615 --> 19:12.614
How can you hate trees?

19:12.616 --> 19:15.418
- No one hates trees.
- I do.

19:15.420 --> 19:17.853
I was hiding out
from the police once,

19:17.855 --> 19:20.422
I was stuck in the woods
for weeks.

19:20.424 --> 19:23.558
Nothing but
goddamn trees everywhere.

19:23.560 --> 19:26.197
No one hates trees, man.
That's impossible.

19:29.800 --> 19:31.667
Hey, you know
what I'm gonna do?

19:31.669 --> 19:33.872
I'mma piss on this goddamn tree
right here.

19:34.905 --> 19:36.240
Can you reach that?

19:37.407 --> 19:38.409
Uh-oh!

19:39.443 --> 19:40.578
Oh!

19:45.782 --> 19:48.450
- That's my girl.
- Here you go.

19:48.452 --> 19:49.654
Thank you, baby.

20:04.269 --> 20:05.537
Whose car is that, Mom?

20:08.573 --> 20:09.939
I don't know.

20:09.941 --> 20:11.740
Might be the lumber company.

20:11.742 --> 20:13.412
Grandpa was gonna
thin the forest.

20:14.378 --> 20:15.577
You don't wanna come inside?

20:15.579 --> 20:16.914
Just wanna go to the swing.

20:17.781 --> 20:20.048
Okay. But be careful.

20:20.050 --> 20:21.419
It's very old.

20:30.060 --> 20:31.262
Cheyenne!

20:32.297 --> 20:33.531
Don't bother the bir...

20:34.632 --> 20:35.834
I'm right here, Mom.

20:37.835 --> 20:38.836
Cheyenne?

20:41.838 --> 20:44.640
Baby. Come on, baby.

20:44.642 --> 20:46.245
Get in...
Get in the car, honey.

20:46.778 --> 20:47.876
Come on.

20:47.878 --> 20:49.045
Baby, run!

20:52.517 --> 20:54.452
- Baby, lock the door!
- Open the door!

20:55.086 --> 20:56.318
Open the door!

20:56.320 --> 20:59.521
- Give me the keys!
- Open the door! We're not gonna hurt you!

20:59.523 --> 21:00.989
Open the door!
We're not gonna hurt you!

21:00.991 --> 21:03.528
Turn off the car
or I'll kill the kid.

21:07.664 --> 21:08.899
Put the car into park.

21:12.569 --> 21:14.503
Bitch, that was
a fuckin' warning shot.

21:14.505 --> 21:15.674
Put the car into park.

21:19.410 --> 21:21.043
Unlock the door.

21:21.045 --> 21:22.911
Baby.

21:22.913 --> 21:24.449
- Yeah.
- Unlock the door.

21:27.085 --> 21:28.817
Everything's gonna be fine.

21:28.819 --> 21:30.454
- Get out!
- Okay.

21:33.691 --> 21:35.357
What are we gonna do with them?

21:35.359 --> 21:37.625
- Okay. It's okay.
- Have you seen any rope around here?

21:37.627 --> 21:38.629
No.

21:41.932 --> 21:43.301
Let's start with names.

21:44.134 --> 21:45.871
I know you're Cheyenne.

21:46.738 --> 21:47.873
That's a pretty name.

21:49.039 --> 21:50.075
Is it because you're shy?

21:51.409 --> 21:52.411
Hmm?

21:53.611 --> 21:54.680
What's your name?

21:56.446 --> 21:58.646
- Audrey.
- Audrey.

21:58.648 --> 21:59.850
That's not so pretty.

22:00.884 --> 22:01.984
What's your middle name?

22:01.986 --> 22:04.623
- Hey, man, can I talk to you?
- Yeah, in a minute.

22:05.690 --> 22:07.823
So where's the old man, huh?

22:07.825 --> 22:10.159
- Grandpa?
- Yeah, grandpa.

22:10.161 --> 22:11.863
- He died.
- Died?

22:12.896 --> 22:14.764
Who gets the water rights?

22:14.766 --> 22:16.335
Water rights? I don't...

22:17.067 --> 22:18.834
I don't know.

22:18.836 --> 22:21.504
Whoever he leaves them to
I guess.

22:21.506 --> 22:23.773
Well, when will we
find out who get them?

22:23.775 --> 22:25.977
We read the will next week.

22:28.846 --> 22:30.412
Can't watch them for a week.

22:30.414 --> 22:31.883
You're right, man.
Come on, let's talk.

22:40.525 --> 22:41.957
Okay, first off,

22:41.959 --> 22:44.727
I don't like you
pointing the rifle at a kid.

22:44.729 --> 22:45.928
Really?

22:45.930 --> 22:48.063
Well, the old man
was once a kid.

22:48.065 --> 22:49.931
Audrey was once a kid.

22:49.933 --> 22:53.102
So if somebody's 17,
and they turn 18 tomorrow,

22:53.104 --> 22:55.438
I gotta wait till tomorrow to be
able to point a rifle at 'em?

22:55.440 --> 22:57.539
I had it
with your smart ass bullshit.

22:57.541 --> 22:59.174
I had it
with your pussy-footing.

22:59.176 --> 23:02.010
- Hey, fuck you, cowboy!
- Fuck you, Zulu!

23:02.012 --> 23:04.046
I was born in America,
dumb shit.

23:04.048 --> 23:06.148
You don't even know
what a Zulu is.

23:06.150 --> 23:07.283
I know what it is.

23:07.285 --> 23:09.617
It's that dude that plays
with chicken bones all day

23:09.619 --> 23:11.554
'cause he's got the best drugs.

23:11.556 --> 23:13.588
That's a sangoma, dumbass.

23:13.590 --> 23:15.524
It's all the same
bullshit to me.

23:15.526 --> 23:16.795
Now what are we
gonna do with them?

23:24.701 --> 23:27.001
If you sign
the water rights over,

23:27.003 --> 23:28.203
we'll let you go.

23:28.205 --> 23:30.139
Man, we don't even know
she'll get them.

23:30.141 --> 23:32.775
If she does,
we already have the contract.

23:32.777 --> 23:33.776
How about it?

23:33.778 --> 23:36.211
Bobby will be here in a bit
with the papers.

23:36.213 --> 23:37.816
You sign it, and that's it.

23:38.615 --> 23:39.951
What about you, shy one?

23:43.855 --> 23:45.156
You know anything about this?

23:47.825 --> 23:48.826
Does she talk?

23:49.794 --> 23:52.795
- She's scared.
- Oh, yeah?

23:52.797 --> 23:54.833
Are you mad
'cause I pointed a rifle at you?

23:56.267 --> 23:57.799
Yeah, well,

23:57.801 --> 24:00.538
if you don't talk,
I'm gonna point it at you again.

24:01.739 --> 24:03.171
This time I might fire it.

24:03.173 --> 24:06.609
Damn it, Rainy, I told you not to
threaten that kid with the rifle.

24:06.611 --> 24:08.747
Hey, you said not to point it at her.
Did I point it at her?

24:11.015 --> 24:12.184
Go on, shy one.

24:13.084 --> 24:14.749
Go on, baby, answer him.

24:20.657 --> 24:22.593
Me and Mom can't afford rent.

24:23.794 --> 24:26.161
So we thought we might
move in here.

24:26.163 --> 24:28.532
Oh, isn't that interesting?

24:29.733 --> 24:31.633
How you know
you get the house?

24:31.635 --> 24:33.102
We don't.

24:33.104 --> 24:34.239
Was I talking to you?

24:35.138 --> 24:36.240
Let her answer.

24:38.843 --> 24:42.545
Mr. Pendleton said
we'll probably get it.

24:42.547 --> 24:46.550
Because Grandpa was a hermit and
didn't have much family left.

24:47.718 --> 24:49.721
She'll probably
get the water rights, too.

24:50.688 --> 24:52.086
Problem solved.

24:52.088 --> 24:55.092
All we have to do now,
is just wait for Bobby.

24:56.826 --> 24:59.196
Yeah. I need a fucking beer.

25:09.906 --> 25:10.908
Oh, damn.

25:12.242 --> 25:14.742
What the hell did
the old man eat? Chickpea?

25:14.744 --> 25:16.747
There's more mouse shit
than food in these cupboards.

25:17.347 --> 25:19.014
He was 90.

25:19.016 --> 25:22.017
Maybe mouse shit was his secret
to longevity.

25:22.019 --> 25:23.751
Maybe you should
eat some, cowboy.

25:23.753 --> 25:24.855
Yeah? You think I won't?

25:25.589 --> 25:26.590
How much?

25:28.092 --> 25:29.924
I told you
I don't have any money.

25:29.926 --> 25:31.860
You have some beer in the car.
You remember?

25:31.862 --> 25:32.898
Oh, yeah, that's right.

25:34.097 --> 25:35.663
Why don't you go
get it for me?

25:35.665 --> 25:36.768
Fuck you.

25:39.936 --> 25:40.938
Audrey.

25:43.207 --> 25:44.676
Why don't you go get my beer?

25:46.644 --> 25:48.813
Untie me.

25:49.779 --> 25:51.115
She's got wit.

25:52.048 --> 25:53.117
I like that.

25:55.819 --> 25:57.021
I like that a lot.

25:59.256 --> 26:02.690
Hey, man, why don't you
step out for a spell?

26:02.692 --> 26:04.325
Hey, man, we didn't
come here for that.

26:04.327 --> 26:05.829
Yeah, I know,

26:06.631 --> 26:08.099
but, well, you know.

26:11.234 --> 26:12.401
Leave her alone.

26:12.403 --> 26:14.639
Oh, I see you draw the line
at pushing around old men.

26:15.205 --> 26:16.674
Just leave her alone.

26:23.114 --> 26:24.345
Don't worry.

26:24.347 --> 26:26.116
It's for him. Not for you.

26:26.884 --> 26:27.885
Just in case.

26:34.724 --> 26:36.827
Well, fuck you,
I'll get my own beer.

26:48.405 --> 26:49.707
Well, fuck you.

26:52.308 --> 26:53.845
Oh, yeah.

27:11.095 --> 27:12.096
Nice.

27:18.736 --> 27:19.804
Motherfucking birds.

27:22.272 --> 27:23.841
Loud ass fucking birds.

27:28.878 --> 27:29.947
Hey, man.

27:32.048 --> 27:33.817
Why didn't you tell me
you're firing one up?

27:34.919 --> 27:35.817
You didn't ask.

27:35.819 --> 27:37.288
Yeah, let me
get some of that.

27:40.423 --> 27:42.326
Here, man, maybe it'll
mellow you out.

27:45.429 --> 27:48.066
Goddamn, this shit can blow
a hole through a bag ball.

27:50.500 --> 27:52.903
Nah, man,
it's an acquired taste.

27:56.140 --> 27:57.175
Hey, you want some?

27:58.442 --> 27:59.507
No, thank you.

27:59.509 --> 28:00.979
You sure? It'll loosen you up.

28:01.746 --> 28:04.078
Get the tension out.

28:04.080 --> 28:07.718
Believe me, darlin', you look like you're
under a lot of pressure right now.

28:10.421 --> 28:12.121
- What about you?
- She doesn't want any.

28:12.123 --> 28:13.258
I didn't ask you.

28:19.028 --> 28:20.265
Suit yourself.

28:21.365 --> 28:24.065
You know what you are, cowboy?
A glut.

28:25.135 --> 28:27.469
You don't know when to quit.

28:27.471 --> 28:30.305
Hey, man, if you wanted it back,
all you have to do is ask.

28:30.307 --> 28:31.710
Don't have to get personal.

28:32.209 --> 28:33.211
Here.

28:42.219 --> 28:43.321
Move over.

28:46.056 --> 28:47.192
You comfortable?

28:47.825 --> 28:48.990
No.

28:48.992 --> 28:51.426
Would you be comfortable with
two criminals in your house?

28:51.428 --> 28:53.796
This isn't your house
yet, remember?

28:53.798 --> 28:55.400
Besides, Jawari is not
really a criminal.

28:57.067 --> 28:58.336
Worst thing Jawari's ever done,

28:59.170 --> 29:01.036
sell skimpy bags of dope.

29:01.038 --> 29:03.471
I told you, I don't
sell skimpy bags.

29:03.473 --> 29:04.873
My friends don't lie.

29:04.875 --> 29:07.042
Your friends are lying
sacks of shit.

29:07.044 --> 29:11.516
Nothing wrong with getting
a little extra out of the deal.

29:13.049 --> 29:14.985
What do you say, Audrey? Hmm?

29:16.287 --> 29:18.987
All we have to do
is wait for Bobby.

29:18.989 --> 29:20.956
Do you wanna fuck up
something that simple?

29:20.958 --> 29:22.961
Hey, you're a real killjoy,
you know that?

29:25.362 --> 29:28.330
- Just chill out, man.
- Yeah.

29:28.332 --> 29:30.332
Yeah, why don't you take a nap?

29:34.939 --> 29:36.307
Man, you're so annoying.

29:38.107 --> 29:41.043
He's gonna be real pissed
when he wakes up.

29:41.045 --> 29:43.014
Please don't hurt us.

29:47.183 --> 29:48.318
It's all right.

29:51.989 --> 29:53.958
I'm not actually
forcing myself on you.

29:54.858 --> 29:55.859
Okay?

29:56.527 --> 29:58.927
All I want...

29:58.929 --> 30:01.132
All I want is
for you to ask for it.

30:04.401 --> 30:05.403
Now, go on.

30:06.936 --> 30:08.005
Go on, ask for it.

30:11.208 --> 30:12.977
I don't know
what you want me to say.

30:14.144 --> 30:18.048
I want you to ask for it.

30:18.615 --> 30:19.817
I can't.

30:21.951 --> 30:24.620
You can. And you will.

30:24.622 --> 30:27.389
Cheyenne, can she please leave?

30:27.391 --> 30:29.557
No, fuck that.

30:29.559 --> 30:32.094
You can say it
in front of shy one.

30:32.096 --> 30:33.661
She's too young
to understand anyway.

30:33.663 --> 30:34.865
I can't.

30:35.531 --> 30:37.367
Yeah? All right.

30:37.934 --> 30:38.936
Okay.

30:40.671 --> 30:41.873
Come on.

30:49.613 --> 30:51.316
You sit here
and see what happens next.

30:55.318 --> 30:57.855
I don't... I don't know
what you want me to say.

30:59.923 --> 31:01.192
I'll do whatever you want.

31:04.193 --> 31:05.462
Maybe Cheyenne will ask fir it.

31:07.230 --> 31:08.232
No.

31:08.932 --> 31:10.532
Please. No.

31:10.534 --> 31:13.235
- I don't know what you want me to say!
- Come on, Cheyenne.

31:13.237 --> 31:15.304
Let's leave Audrey here
to think about things.

31:15.306 --> 31:17.508
No, God. Please.
I'll say anything you want.

31:18.174 --> 31:19.474
Please.

31:19.476 --> 31:20.979
Please take me!

31:22.211 --> 31:23.381
Take me!

31:28.652 --> 31:30.153
Take me!

31:30.621 --> 31:31.956
Oh, my God!

31:36.693 --> 31:38.262
Take me!

31:42.199 --> 31:43.664
Well, if you're gonna beg.

31:43.666 --> 31:45.435
I knew my charm
would wear you down.

31:50.140 --> 31:52.407
Baby.

31:52.409 --> 31:55.546
I need you to be really strong
for Mama right now, okay?

31:56.079 --> 31:57.144
Okay.

31:57.146 --> 31:59.680
I need this. For me, okay, baby?

31:59.682 --> 32:01.551
Come on. Come on.

32:09.759 --> 32:11.727
Let's go. Sit down.

32:11.729 --> 32:13.194
Stay quiet.

32:13.196 --> 32:14.997
You okay?

32:14.999 --> 32:17.302
It's okay. Take a deep breath.

32:20.503 --> 32:22.036
It's okay.

32:35.486 --> 32:37.285
What's this?

32:37.287 --> 32:40.654
Oh, right, a pamphlet.
Whatever could it be about?

32:40.656 --> 32:43.324
Hello, sir. My name is David.

32:43.326 --> 32:45.526
I just wanted to leave you
with some literature

32:45.528 --> 32:48.130
and to ask if you'd heard
the good news

32:48.132 --> 32:50.465
concerning our Lord
and Savior, Jesus Christ.

32:50.467 --> 32:51.536
You know what country you're in?

32:52.702 --> 32:54.302
- I'm sorry?
- It's a simple question.

32:54.304 --> 32:57.671
David, do you know what country
that you are in?

33:00.443 --> 33:03.013
- This is America.
- That's right. This is America.

33:06.215 --> 33:08.150
I'm sorry, sir, I'm not sure
what you're getting at.

33:08.152 --> 33:10.384
Did you see that church
on the corner down there?

33:10.386 --> 33:13.188
I sure did. It's a,
it's a really lovely big...

33:13.190 --> 33:17.092
That's one of a million on damn
near every corner in this country.

33:17.094 --> 33:20.194
Do you really think that you're gonna
run into someone who's never heard of

33:20.196 --> 33:21.465
Jesus fuckin' Christ?

33:22.665 --> 33:25.534
Hey, I'll tell you
where you need to go.

33:25.536 --> 33:28.636
You need to go to one of those
remote areas in Africa

33:28.638 --> 33:31.405
where they, uh, have
all those crazy tribes,

33:31.407 --> 33:33.275
where they worship tigers
and shit.

33:33.277 --> 33:35.509
That's where you'll find people
that never heard of Jesus.

33:35.511 --> 33:38.580
Okay. Sorry to bother you.

33:38.582 --> 33:42.487
You wanna know why Christians don't
like to go down to those places...

33:43.753 --> 33:45.423
'Cause you'll get a spear
in your ass.

33:46.323 --> 33:47.689
That's why.

33:47.691 --> 33:49.760
They'll make a necklace
out of your fuckin' head.

33:52.596 --> 33:53.828
I'll move on.

33:56.700 --> 33:59.433
Uh, have a good day, sir.

33:59.435 --> 34:00.605
You saw something, didn't you?

34:02.705 --> 34:05.606
- What?
- Don't act stupid with me.

34:05.608 --> 34:07.709
You just saw something,
didn't you?

34:07.711 --> 34:09.646
I don't know what
you're talking about, sir.

34:10.646 --> 34:12.380
I'll leave now. Thank you.

34:12.382 --> 34:14.282
That's why
I hate people like you.

34:14.284 --> 34:16.686
You would just lie like the
devil the second it suits you.

34:20.757 --> 34:24.094
Oh, now you're thinkin' about running
away like a little pussy, aren't you?

34:24.460 --> 34:25.462
Hmm.

34:41.744 --> 34:44.378
Come now, I'm trying
to be an asshole.

34:44.380 --> 34:47.350
I just, I just want you
to admit that you lied.

34:48.684 --> 34:51.518
Now, Audrey here did something
to tip you off

34:51.521 --> 34:53.353
and then you acted
like you were leaving

34:53.356 --> 34:55.289
when you were
really going for help.

34:55.291 --> 34:57.858
And then I asked you if you
saw something and you lied.

34:57.860 --> 35:00.530
I don't know

35:01.465 --> 35:03.264
What's going on here.

35:03.266 --> 35:05.467
I don't know
what any of this is about.

35:05.469 --> 35:08.472
This is about you lying,
and not being able to admit it.

35:11.675 --> 35:13.644
Okay. Okay.

35:15.445 --> 35:17.512
I admit it.

35:17.514 --> 35:20.117
I'm sorry.
I admit it, I lied.

35:21.617 --> 35:22.784
Well, now.

35:22.786 --> 35:25.322
That's not a very sincere
admission now, is it, David?

35:27.590 --> 35:29.391
I don't know
what you want me to say.

35:29.393 --> 35:31.496
Yeah, there's
a lot of that going around.

35:33.262 --> 35:34.829
I just want you,

35:34.831 --> 35:36.630
to admit

35:36.632 --> 35:38.465
- you lied.
- Stop it!

35:38.467 --> 35:40.802
Please leave him.

35:40.804 --> 35:43.704
I just want a little bit
of sincerity, David.

35:43.706 --> 35:47.208
Is that too much to ask?

35:49.278 --> 35:52.516
I... I saw her
looking out the window.

35:54.985 --> 35:56.253
I'm sorry.

35:58.487 --> 36:00.889
She was looking out the window.

36:00.891 --> 36:03.760
I... I didn't know what to do.
I was afraid.

36:04.927 --> 36:06.663
I didn't want to get involved.
I was...

36:07.898 --> 36:10.168
I was... I'm so sorry.

36:11.335 --> 36:13.235
Did you hear that, Audrey?

36:13.237 --> 36:15.338
He's the Christian. He was
gonna leave you here to rot.

36:17.474 --> 36:19.407
I bet you wish
all that prayer bullshit

36:19.409 --> 36:20.878
really worked right about now,
don't you?

36:24.880 --> 36:26.250
Hey, cowboy.

36:28.251 --> 36:30.318
Ought to blow
your fucking head off.

36:30.320 --> 36:31.519
Come on, Zulu.

36:31.521 --> 36:34.555
You're not mad over that little
bump on your head, are you?

36:34.557 --> 36:36.893
I was just trying to get a little
bit of alone time with my lady.

36:37.927 --> 36:39.793
Who the hell is this?

36:39.795 --> 36:41.662
Oh, that's my new friend, David.

36:41.664 --> 36:43.664
He likes to preach the gospel
when he isn't...

36:43.666 --> 36:44.766
I owe you a whack.

36:47.570 --> 36:48.737
Hey.

36:48.739 --> 36:50.775
What are you doing out of bed?
Where's your wheelchair?

36:52.576 --> 36:54.344
I gotta walk around
a little bit.

36:55.411 --> 36:56.614
Get the blood flowing.

36:57.748 --> 36:58.782
Oh.

37:00.684 --> 37:01.852
Ah.

37:06.489 --> 37:08.389
All fine "busy" ness.

37:08.391 --> 37:10.325
It's a disease.

37:10.327 --> 37:12.760
- Yeah.
- Busy, busy, busy.

37:12.762 --> 37:14.595
Something I gotta take care of.

37:14.597 --> 37:15.766
Yeah. Well...

37:16.699 --> 37:18.666
I remember being busy.

37:18.668 --> 37:20.270
When I built all this,

37:20.737 --> 37:21.939
I was a busy man.

37:23.005 --> 37:24.442
Hadn't worked once.

37:25.608 --> 37:26.811
I had nothing

37:27.710 --> 37:28.745
and I wanted it all.

37:29.846 --> 37:31.845
I know.
I know. You told me.

37:31.847 --> 37:35.353
My dad,
we didn't get on very well.

37:37.054 --> 37:41.655
But he told me,
"If you want a million dollars,

37:41.657 --> 37:44.996
"you better put in a million
dollar's worth of work."

37:46.996 --> 37:48.862
Yep.

37:48.864 --> 37:50.932
I worked that hard
for a long time

37:50.934 --> 37:52.937
so that you guys
wouldn't have to.

37:54.905 --> 37:58.405
And now I'm not sure
I did the right thing.

37:58.407 --> 38:00.742
Don't say that.
We got money.

38:00.744 --> 38:02.613
That's power.
Nobody fucks with us.

38:05.114 --> 38:09.717
Everybody thinks that
getting power is, you know,

38:09.719 --> 38:12.454
gonna be about being lucky.

38:12.456 --> 38:15.356
You know, hitting the jackpot,
winning the lottery,

38:15.358 --> 38:16.925
picking a stock.

38:16.927 --> 38:18.996
Nobody thinks
about the hard work.

38:20.496 --> 38:22.866
Nobody thinks
about the sacrifice.

38:24.034 --> 38:27.369
Nobody saw me digging wells

38:27.371 --> 38:30.972
in mud so deep, I couldn't
even get my boots out of it.

38:30.974 --> 38:32.574
Yeah, I bust my ass.

38:32.576 --> 38:34.945
It was all about the water
and the pipes.

38:36.079 --> 38:38.382
And they worked
just like a chain gang.

38:39.916 --> 38:43.650
Somebody told you
when you could take a break,

38:43.652 --> 38:47.557
somebody told you when you
could get a drink of water.

38:48.759 --> 38:50.527
And I decided right then.

38:52.496 --> 38:55.932
Someday, I was gonna
have all the water.

38:57.467 --> 38:59.099
And I was gonna
dig in the ground

38:59.101 --> 39:00.668
until the ground bled

39:00.670 --> 39:05.407
because no son of a bitch was
ever gonna tell me again,

39:05.409 --> 39:07.378
when I could
have a drink of water.

39:08.911 --> 39:09.980
Let's take you back to bed.
Come on.

39:11.581 --> 39:13.884
A man should
have the right to drink water

39:14.650 --> 39:16.086
whenever he wants to.

39:17.186 --> 39:19.589
What a pleasure.

39:20.456 --> 39:22.923
Oh, how pathetic am I!

39:22.925 --> 39:24.795
You know what happens
when you get older?

39:26.463 --> 39:27.698
You can't stop it.

39:28.831 --> 39:30.034
I know.

39:31.001 --> 39:32.599
I'm feeling it.

39:32.601 --> 39:33.837
You remember your grandmother?

39:34.538 --> 39:35.572
Yeah.

39:37.807 --> 39:39.576
She was right.

39:41.844 --> 39:45.679
- About what?
- A vacation.

39:45.681 --> 39:48.048
She thought that family should
spend more time together

39:48.050 --> 39:50.985
so she wanted us
to go to Brussels.

39:50.987 --> 39:53.958
To the World's Fair.
Tell me, no.

39:54.858 --> 39:58.059
Um, the Expo in 1958.

39:58.061 --> 40:00.028
And I argued her out of it

40:00.030 --> 40:02.229
and told her
no, I want to work harder,

40:02.231 --> 40:04.666
and how we needed
to get money for the family.

40:04.668 --> 40:08.635
And, uh, put everybody
in better shape than we were in.

40:08.637 --> 40:11.007
And, uh, now look at everything.

40:12.242 --> 40:13.677
Your dad's in jail.

40:15.045 --> 40:17.912
He wanted to make money
the easy way.

40:17.914 --> 40:19.880
- He didn't wanna earn it.
- Hmm.

40:19.882 --> 40:23.420
Water? Why don't you just turn
on the faucet? You got water.

40:26.255 --> 40:27.690
Your grandma was right.

40:29.059 --> 40:31.862
Your grandma was a true

40:33.496 --> 40:34.931
one of a kinder.

40:36.699 --> 40:38.835
I'm lying here,
half dead in my bed,

40:40.836 --> 40:42.472
wishing that, uh,

40:45.108 --> 40:46.907
I had gone to Brussels.

40:50.713 --> 40:53.248
Nobody ever dies wishing
that they'd worked harder,

40:53.250 --> 40:55.583
but they never tell you
what to wish for.

40:55.585 --> 40:57.822
I think I gotta get going.

40:59.222 --> 41:02.055
It was good to
spend some time with you though.

41:02.057 --> 41:04.258
You lying piece of shit.
It wasn't good talking to me.

41:04.260 --> 41:05.695
You were bored shitless.

41:06.295 --> 41:08.829
Tell me. Walk on out.

41:08.831 --> 41:10.965
- Will you let us go?
- That's the plan.

41:10.967 --> 41:12.666
But you can't tell anyone.

41:12.668 --> 41:14.568
I don't even
want the water rights.

41:14.570 --> 41:16.704
You could have
just asked me for them.

41:16.706 --> 41:20.008
I can't take care of all the
pipes and filters anyway.

41:20.010 --> 41:22.844
We just could have
asked for them?

41:22.846 --> 41:24.914
How did you
get mixed up in all this anyway?

41:26.081 --> 41:27.315
You seem nice.

41:27.317 --> 41:29.219
You watch too much TV, Audrey.

41:29.786 --> 41:30.855
Zulu.

41:32.188 --> 41:34.988
Put the gun down.
You're not gonna shoot anyone.

41:34.990 --> 41:37.791
First off, I told you
it's a goddamn rifle.

41:37.793 --> 41:39.760
Don't you know
the fucking difference?

41:39.762 --> 41:42.229
A rifle.
A rifle's got a rifle bore

41:42.231 --> 41:44.898
which causes the bullet to come
out spinning like a football.

41:44.900 --> 41:47.702
And a gun, has got a smooth bore

41:47.704 --> 41:49.604
so it's accuracy is shit.

41:49.606 --> 41:52.307
Secondly,
I thought you knew me better.

41:52.309 --> 41:54.245
What makes you think
I won't shoot your ass dead?

41:56.012 --> 41:57.811
I took the bullets out.

41:57.813 --> 41:59.947
You would think that
a gun expert like yourself

41:59.949 --> 42:01.983
would notice that
its magazine was missing.

42:01.985 --> 42:05.153
Son of a bitch.

42:05.155 --> 42:08.789
Yeah, I was just messing with you.
I wasn't gonna shoot you.

42:08.791 --> 42:10.560
Have a seat.
We wait for Bobby.

42:12.329 --> 42:15.833
No. You sit on the recliner.
You take the couch.

42:16.599 --> 42:18.266
Fine.

42:18.268 --> 42:19.903
I wanted the recliner anyway.

42:24.173 --> 42:26.874
You really messed things up
this time.

42:26.876 --> 42:29.943
Me? I was just having
a little fun like the old days.

42:29.945 --> 42:33.083
You know, rape, pillage, burn
and all that.

42:36.385 --> 42:38.251
What this?

42:38.253 --> 42:41.688
Hey, you mind if I whittle
while we wait?

42:41.690 --> 42:43.090
I thought you hated trees.

42:43.092 --> 42:44.728
I do. That's why
I like cutting 'em up.

42:46.228 --> 42:48.598
You know what, I'm gonna carve
you a little tiki statue.

42:52.635 --> 42:54.838
Hey, Audrey, you want me
to make you something?

42:56.806 --> 42:58.275
Just make your tiki statue.

42:59.809 --> 43:01.812
I don't think Jawari
appreciates my efforts.

43:03.278 --> 43:05.045
Besides,

43:05.047 --> 43:06.583
you're much prettier
than Jawari.

43:09.119 --> 43:10.721
I don't want anything from you.

43:11.286 --> 43:13.890
Oh, Audrey. That's cold.

43:14.858 --> 43:16.724
That really hurt my feelings.

43:16.726 --> 43:19.827
I doubt you have any feelings.

43:19.829 --> 43:22.365
That's not true.
I'm a sensitive guy.

43:25.101 --> 43:26.269
Let me ask you something.

43:27.269 --> 43:28.903
If you just met me,

43:28.905 --> 43:31.171
and you didn't know
nothing about me,

43:31.173 --> 43:33.106
would you even talk to me?

43:33.108 --> 43:35.175
I mean, if we
just met up somewhere,

43:35.177 --> 43:37.679
and I just came up to you and you
didn't know nothing about me,

43:37.681 --> 43:40.014
and we just started talking
about simple things.

43:40.016 --> 43:41.918
And I didn't do anything
to creep you out.

43:43.286 --> 43:44.621
What would you think of me?

43:47.456 --> 43:48.925
You might fool me.

43:51.927 --> 43:53.396
I fool myself sometimes.

43:57.701 --> 43:59.003
But I do know you.

44:00.335 --> 44:02.805
I know everything I need to know.

44:03.940 --> 44:05.472
You're evil.

44:05.474 --> 44:07.810
You're cruel and vicious.

44:09.378 --> 44:10.780
You're a monster.

44:12.047 --> 44:14.014
And I wouldn't
want to talk to you.

44:14.016 --> 44:15.883
I wouldn't want to see you.

44:15.885 --> 44:18.351
I wouldn't want
anything to do with you.

44:18.353 --> 44:21.424
She struck you down, man.

44:24.393 --> 44:25.695
Mom.

44:27.163 --> 44:29.833
You got me.

44:30.900 --> 44:32.900
You know what, Audrey?

44:32.902 --> 44:34.804
I'm gonna make you
a little giraffe.

44:35.371 --> 44:36.440
You like giraffes?

44:37.407 --> 44:39.840
Everybody likes giraffes.

44:39.842 --> 44:42.476
I don't know anyone
who doesn't like a giraffe.

44:42.478 --> 44:45.081
I didn't think there was anyone
who didn't like trees.

44:46.248 --> 44:48.317
You know, I was
in those woods for weeks.

44:49.351 --> 44:51.154
Those trees became
like prison bars.

44:52.989 --> 44:54.789
I don't think anyone's ever
had an experience like that

44:54.791 --> 44:55.793
with giraffes.

44:57.427 --> 44:59.360
Do you like giraffes, Audrey?

44:59.362 --> 45:01.130
I don't have anything else
to say to you.

45:04.266 --> 45:06.869
Man, I can't believe you're
gonna smoke that all by yourself.

45:09.239 --> 45:10.972
You ever heard
about paying for it?

45:10.974 --> 45:12.373
Man, I paid for those beers.

45:12.375 --> 45:14.244
I didn't drink
any of those beers.

45:17.380 --> 45:18.816
How much you want
for that joint?

45:19.382 --> 45:21.349
I'll give you $2.

45:21.351 --> 45:22.720
- Two bucks?
- Yeah.

45:23.552 --> 45:24.922
How much you want for it?

45:26.255 --> 45:29.125
I'll take the two bucks
if you calm the fuck down.

45:43.972 --> 45:46.173
So what church do you belong to?

45:46.175 --> 45:48.846
I know it's not Mormon.
They travel in pairs.

45:51.447 --> 45:53.050
It's the Church
of the Living Word.

45:54.449 --> 45:56.319
What is that?
Is that, uh, Jehovah's Witness?

45:59.054 --> 46:00.554
Protestant.

46:00.556 --> 46:02.225
What do they think about
you being a homo?

46:05.929 --> 46:08.061
Just as I thought.

46:08.063 --> 46:09.832
You know, it's a sin
according to that Bible.

46:10.867 --> 46:11.902
Yes, I do.

46:14.903 --> 46:16.137
I'm not.

46:16.139 --> 46:19.173
Just like you didn't see Audrey.

46:19.175 --> 46:23.510
I bet you spent your whole life
trying to, uh, get away from it.

46:23.512 --> 46:25.414
Spending every day
trying to pray it away.

46:28.952 --> 46:30.120
No.

46:31.855 --> 46:33.588
It's in the eyes.

46:33.590 --> 46:36.023
That's not something
that you can know about someone

46:36.025 --> 46:37.992
by looking into their eyes.

46:37.994 --> 46:39.129
Yes, you can.

46:40.530 --> 46:43.197
They promised you inner peace,
didn't they?

46:43.199 --> 46:44.467
And you didn't get shit.

46:46.436 --> 46:50.003
Day in, day out,
in the hot sun for Jesus.

46:50.005 --> 46:52.505
What do you get in return? Hmm?

46:52.507 --> 46:54.242
"Hi" and "bye" on a Sunday

46:54.244 --> 46:57.211
and "put some money in the
plate" and "see you next week"?

46:57.213 --> 47:00.213
I get a whole lot more
than that.

47:00.215 --> 47:02.950
Did you ever feel
the Holy Spirit inside you?

47:02.952 --> 47:04.488
Here, man, just mellow out.

47:07.090 --> 47:08.325
I want this back.

47:17.032 --> 47:18.900
Oh, you wanna borrow my knife?

47:18.902 --> 47:20.501
No, thank you, cowboy.

47:20.503 --> 47:21.738
I got a real knife.

47:25.608 --> 47:27.541
My bowie sounds better
than a switchblade.

47:27.543 --> 47:28.579
Seriously, dude?

47:29.512 --> 47:32.213
My flick to your click-clack?

47:32.215 --> 47:35.115
See the difference?
Two steps to one.

47:35.117 --> 47:38.485
Fan knives are better.
More reliable, I'm telling you.

47:38.487 --> 47:43.090
Besides, everybody knows that switchblades
are cooler than butterfly knives.

47:43.092 --> 47:45.293
You can't carve a giraffe
with a switchblade.

47:45.295 --> 47:47.360
The blade's too flimsy.

47:47.362 --> 47:49.265
Do you have to do that
in front of my kid?

47:50.300 --> 47:51.501
It's just a little coke.

47:53.335 --> 47:54.971
Okay, I'll keep it
away from her.

47:58.240 --> 47:59.673
Don't worry about it, darlin'.

47:59.675 --> 48:02.510
You can't get high
off second hand pot smoke.

48:02.512 --> 48:04.280
If you could,
we'd all be high off Jawari.

48:06.449 --> 48:07.617
I'll tell you what, Audrey.

48:08.650 --> 48:10.650
I'll put out this joint

48:10.652 --> 48:12.221
if you'll tell me
about yourself.

48:13.021 --> 48:14.521
What do you wanna know?

48:14.523 --> 48:15.659
What do you do for a living?

48:18.061 --> 48:18.994
I'm a waitress.

48:18.996 --> 48:21.231
Now will you please stop
blowing smoke at us?

48:22.498 --> 48:24.400
Not until you answer
few more questions.

48:25.702 --> 48:27.168
How many questions?

48:27.170 --> 48:29.505
I don't know. About five.

48:31.074 --> 48:33.007
I've already answered one.

48:33.009 --> 48:34.443
All right, then we got
four more to go.

48:36.411 --> 48:37.580
Were you a cheerleader?

48:39.215 --> 48:41.215
What does that have to do
with anything?

48:41.217 --> 48:42.485
I'm asking the questions.

48:45.621 --> 48:47.420
No.

48:47.422 --> 48:49.255
Were you popular in high school?

48:49.257 --> 48:51.057
That's completely subjective.

48:51.059 --> 48:52.092
No, no, it's not.

48:52.094 --> 48:54.327
Whether or not you were
popular in high school

48:54.329 --> 48:56.465
will tell me
virtually everything about you.

48:58.400 --> 48:59.967
How is that?

48:59.969 --> 49:03.604
Because high school's where people are
shaped for the rest of their lives.

49:03.606 --> 49:06.374
What you were back then
versus what you are now

49:06.376 --> 49:07.477
tells me everything.

49:10.445 --> 49:14.581
Well, I don't know if I would
be considered popular or not.

49:14.583 --> 49:16.719
Yeah, you do. People know if they
were popular in high school.

49:17.719 --> 49:19.619
I was valedictorian.

49:19.621 --> 49:21.290
See, I knew there was
something about you.

49:22.791 --> 49:24.724
Then you became a waitress.

49:24.726 --> 49:26.459
That tells me a lot.

49:26.461 --> 49:28.396
Did you go to college?

49:28.398 --> 49:31.599
I went for a couple of years,
but then I had to drop out.

49:31.601 --> 49:35.369
Look how much we've learned
in just four questions.

49:35.371 --> 49:37.804
You were valedictorian
and you dropped out of college

49:37.806 --> 49:39.475
and you became a waitress.

49:42.411 --> 49:44.080
Don't think I didn't
notice the wording.

49:44.579 --> 49:46.179
"Had to drop out."

49:46.181 --> 49:50.050
Not "I dropped out".
"Had to".

49:50.052 --> 49:53.820
Doesn't mean anything. Lots of
people drop out of college.

49:53.822 --> 49:56.257
Not lots of valedictorians.

49:56.259 --> 49:58.758
Had to do with money
more than anything else.

49:58.760 --> 50:01.061
Valedictorian that
can't get a scholarship?

50:01.063 --> 50:02.699
- Is that your last question?
- No.

50:04.699 --> 50:07.200
My last question is,

50:07.202 --> 50:10.507
did you drop out
because you were pregnant?

50:20.449 --> 50:22.816
Cheyenne is the best thing
that has ever happened to me.

50:22.818 --> 50:24.784
That's a generic
load of bullshit.

50:24.786 --> 50:26.052
Let me tell you
something, shy one.

50:26.054 --> 50:30.224
People lie, like the lies are
gonna magically turn to money.

50:30.226 --> 50:31.791
And nobody lies
more than parents.

50:31.793 --> 50:33.726
Sounds like someone had
a bad childhood.

50:33.728 --> 50:36.329
Kids come from fucking.

50:36.331 --> 50:38.666
So don't act like
you did something noble.

50:38.668 --> 50:41.101
Do you like talking that way
in front of a little girl?

50:41.103 --> 50:42.672
Parents have kids
for two reasons.

50:43.773 --> 50:45.738
They can't
control themselves sexually,

50:45.740 --> 50:47.340
and kids are cute.

50:47.342 --> 50:49.610
But when those little babies
start growing up,

50:49.612 --> 50:51.778
that shine starts wearing off

50:51.780 --> 50:54.451
and the parents start
resenting that burden.

50:55.384 --> 50:57.150
That's all parents.

50:57.152 --> 50:58.385
Leave her alone. That's no true.

50:58.387 --> 51:01.188
- Cheyenne...
- Oh, it is true.

51:01.190 --> 51:03.389
It is true.
Every parent reaches a point

51:03.391 --> 51:06.226
where they long for
the freedom that they once had,

51:06.228 --> 51:09.195
where they dream of all the
things they could have achieved

51:09.197 --> 51:10.498
if they weren't stuck.

51:10.500 --> 51:12.532
You know what?
You had your last question.

51:12.534 --> 51:15.168
Now you let me answer.
This is the truth, baby.

51:15.170 --> 51:16.572
You listen to me. Okay?

51:17.773 --> 51:19.539
I may have my regrets in life.

51:19.541 --> 51:22.376
I've screwed some things up.
I've screwed a lot of things up.

51:22.378 --> 51:24.512
But I screwed them up, not you.

51:24.514 --> 51:27.815
Yes, I dropped out of college

51:27.817 --> 51:29.682
because I got pregnant,

51:29.684 --> 51:31.087
'cause I couldn't afford it.

51:33.155 --> 51:35.623
I didn't know what I wanted to
do with my life anyway, baby,

51:35.625 --> 51:38.360
but being a mother seemed like
the best thing I could be.

51:40.630 --> 51:42.465
And it was hard. It was tough.

51:45.300 --> 51:47.471
There's times I don't know
if we're gonna make it.

51:50.373 --> 51:53.342
But I will never
regret having you.

51:55.344 --> 51:57.114
There's something
you're not telling us.

51:58.514 --> 52:01.648
Why don't you tell us
about your family?

52:01.650 --> 52:03.819
I'll tell you about my family if
you give me a couple of lines.

52:05.221 --> 52:08.389
Okay. I gotta hear this.

52:08.391 --> 52:11.891
I was no high school valedictorian,
I can tell you that.

52:11.893 --> 52:14.260
My old man was a con artist.

52:14.262 --> 52:16.729
Why am I not surprised?

52:16.731 --> 52:19.168
I remember traveling around
from place to place

52:19.668 --> 52:21.568
all the time.

52:21.570 --> 52:24.804
I was helping him run a show
game when I was only six.

52:24.806 --> 52:27.641
I remember he'd book
into a used car lot office

52:27.643 --> 52:30.211
to steal some keys
one Sunday afternoon.

52:30.213 --> 52:32.481
And, some people came in,
thinking the lot was open.

52:33.449 --> 52:34.684
He sold them a car.

52:36.385 --> 52:37.617
Filled up paperwork
and everything.

52:37.619 --> 52:40.623
He pretended to make a phone
call, checking on their credit.

52:42.490 --> 52:43.659
Banks weren't even open.

52:44.393 --> 52:45.693
Damn, Rainy,

52:45.695 --> 52:49.262
your old man had
a big old set of balls on him.

52:49.264 --> 52:52.432
I asked him why he did it.
He said, "I don't know.

52:52.434 --> 52:53.702
"Just wanted to see
where it went."

52:54.670 --> 52:55.805
Where was your mother?

52:56.639 --> 52:58.238
I never knew her.

52:58.240 --> 52:59.876
So you ran around
with your dad?

53:00.809 --> 53:02.244
That sounds pretty cool.

53:03.746 --> 53:07.581
When I was 12, we broke into
a house to rob the place.

53:07.583 --> 53:09.351
And it was just supposed to be
a woman alone.

53:10.485 --> 53:11.887
My dad made me wait
in the living room.

53:13.556 --> 53:14.691
I could hear her begging.

53:16.291 --> 53:18.559
I heard all these noises and...

53:18.561 --> 53:20.297
I didn't really know
what they were at the time.

53:21.530 --> 53:22.699
And her husband came home.

53:23.932 --> 53:25.534
And I ran to get my dad.

53:26.402 --> 53:27.503
And I opened the door.

53:28.771 --> 53:30.240
I saw him on top of her.

53:31.706 --> 53:32.875
He was so mad.

53:33.976 --> 53:35.311
He threw a pillow at me.

53:36.545 --> 53:37.978
I guess the pillow
hitting the lamp

53:37.980 --> 53:39.615
let the husband know
that we were there.

53:40.548 --> 53:41.684
He took out a gun.

53:43.052 --> 53:46.456
I climbed out the window first,
and I hid in the bushes.

53:48.423 --> 53:49.559
I heard a shot.

53:51.360 --> 53:52.596
I saw my dad hit the ground.

53:54.429 --> 53:55.698
He was just looking at me.

53:57.400 --> 53:58.535
His eyes were open,

53:59.934 --> 54:01.769
but I could tell he was dead.

54:01.771 --> 54:03.406
That's fucked up, man.

54:06.074 --> 54:07.509
I went to a state house.

54:08.643 --> 54:10.512
I've been a menace to society
ever since.

54:12.547 --> 54:16.550
"Put up again
thy sword into his place.

54:16.552 --> 54:19.385
"For all they that
take the sword,

54:19.387 --> 54:21.757
"shall perish with the sword."

54:23.559 --> 54:25.425
Is that in the Bible?

54:25.427 --> 54:27.396
Yes, sir, it certainly is.

54:29.931 --> 54:30.966
Jesus said that.

54:33.402 --> 54:34.834
When they came to arrest him,

54:34.836 --> 54:37.873
one of his disciples cut off the
ear of the high priest's servant.

54:39.775 --> 54:42.612
Jesus put his ear back on
and spoke those words.

54:43.411 --> 54:45.412
He cut his ear off?

54:45.414 --> 54:47.784
- And put it back on?
- Praise Jesus, he did.

54:49.452 --> 54:52.353
Give me some Kool-Aid
and a glass of water,

54:52.355 --> 54:54.356
and I'll show you
how to turn water into wine.

54:55.858 --> 55:00.961
Jesus' miracles are
well documented.

55:00.963 --> 55:03.764
I've seen people who
make a living off of him.

55:03.766 --> 55:06.066
It's kind of, like,
Copperfield's wire pullers

55:06.068 --> 55:07.737
claiming he can
really fly, isn't it?

55:09.938 --> 55:12.139
Lots of people.

55:12.141 --> 55:15.612
Lots of people saved.
Jesus is our savior.

55:16.945 --> 55:19.512
He's a healer. He has healed.

55:19.514 --> 55:21.081
You ever hear of
the immune system?

55:21.083 --> 55:24.521
The immune system
cannot make a blind person see.

55:25.153 --> 55:26.920
Ever hear of a set up?

55:26.922 --> 55:28.391
Faking stuff for money?

55:29.657 --> 55:31.858
All those people wouldn't lie.

55:31.860 --> 55:35.464
Oh, right. Those people are
known for their honesty.

55:36.465 --> 55:37.467
Right.

55:41.170 --> 55:43.103
Want to see me
do a magic trick?

55:43.105 --> 55:45.007
I met I can make
a line of coke disappear.

55:46.074 --> 55:47.443
What do you say, bro?

55:48.077 --> 55:49.112
Hmm?

55:51.514 --> 55:52.682
Put my knife down.

55:54.617 --> 55:55.919
Put the log down.

55:57.753 --> 55:59.153
Hmm?

55:59.155 --> 56:00.724
Come on over. You earned it.

56:04.492 --> 56:07.094
Did I ever tell you why I was in
the woods for all those weeks?

56:07.096 --> 56:08.597
When I was on the run
from the cops.

56:09.498 --> 56:10.567
- No.
- Hmm?

56:11.467 --> 56:13.635
Murder.

56:14.836 --> 56:17.037
I killed my ex-girlfriend
and her lover.

56:17.039 --> 56:18.608
I had to change my identity.

56:24.179 --> 56:25.948
You look a little bit
peaky there, Zulu.

56:36.891 --> 56:38.761
I bet that's the same look
my daddy had.

56:48.471 --> 56:51.505
Don't hurt us.
I'll do whatever you want.

56:51.507 --> 56:53.474
Just don't hurt Cheyenne.

56:53.476 --> 56:55.141
- Please.
- Shut up.

56:55.143 --> 56:57.677
My giraffe's not good enough
for you, remember?

56:57.679 --> 56:59.780
Please. Please.

56:59.782 --> 57:02.452
There was any reason for this
to escalate into murder.

57:03.152 --> 57:05.586
There still isn't.

57:05.588 --> 57:08.557
We can get him some help.
He might still be alive.

57:09.791 --> 57:11.193
Thanks for
pointing that out David.

57:13.829 --> 57:15.262
No!

57:17.099 --> 57:20.066
Oh, this is just sell-out
central here today, isn't it?

57:20.068 --> 57:21.735
First Audrey drags you in to it,

57:21.737 --> 57:23.836
and then you weasel out
of helping her,

57:23.838 --> 57:26.173
and now, you want to make sure
Jawari's dead.

57:26.175 --> 57:28.608
Please. Please. Please, that's not
what I said. That's not what I meant.

57:28.610 --> 57:29.709
That's not what I meant.

57:29.711 --> 57:32.144
Oh, what you mean
is to keep yourself alive.

57:32.146 --> 57:34.981
Even at the expense of
poor Audrey and Cheyenne here.

57:34.983 --> 57:36.148
Oh, God.

57:36.150 --> 57:37.950
Now, here's
what I want you to do.

57:37.952 --> 57:39.052
I want you to pick someone.

57:39.054 --> 57:41.889
And whoever you choose,
I kill.

57:41.891 --> 57:43.126
And the other two stay alive.

57:44.626 --> 57:47.596
What? I...

57:49.097 --> 57:50.731
I can't do that.

57:50.733 --> 57:52.132
Oh, but you must.

57:52.134 --> 57:54.233
You're the one who goes
door to door every day

57:54.235 --> 57:58.170
asking people to make the most
important decision of their lives.

57:58.172 --> 58:00.709
- Right there on the spot.
- Please.

58:01.744 --> 58:03.244
Oh, God have mercy. Please.

58:03.246 --> 58:06.012
Please, please don't do this. Please
don't do this. I can't. I can't.

58:06.014 --> 58:08.782
All right.
Then I'll make you choose.

58:08.784 --> 58:11.217
- No, please, shoot me.
- Shut up.

58:11.219 --> 58:12.221
Shoot me.

58:17.893 --> 58:19.559
You wanna shoot someone,

58:19.561 --> 58:20.929
you wanna hurt someone,

58:22.264 --> 58:24.063
- shoot me.
- Mom.

58:24.065 --> 58:26.166
- You're not good enough for me, remember?
- Shoot me!

58:37.246 --> 58:40.012
You cowardly piece of shit.

58:40.014 --> 58:42.215
I'm gonna count down
from ten to one

58:42.217 --> 58:44.885
and you're gonna choose
between Audrey and yourself.

58:44.887 --> 58:47.954
And if you haven't made a choice
by the time I get to one,

58:47.956 --> 58:50.292
then your choice is Cheyenne.

58:51.025 --> 58:52.291
No.

58:52.293 --> 58:54.360
Please don't hurt...
Don't hurt her. Please.

58:54.362 --> 58:56.896
You shut up.
You don't get a choice.

58:56.898 --> 58:58.268
The choice is all David's.

58:59.101 --> 59:00.570
Are you ready, David?

59:02.137 --> 59:05.338
- Ten.
- No, don't do this.

59:05.340 --> 59:06.740
Please don't do this.

59:06.742 --> 59:08.775
- Nine.
- Forgive me for my sins.

59:08.777 --> 59:10.213
- Bless me. Bless me.
- Eight.

59:11.746 --> 59:13.380
- David, choose me!
- Seven.

59:13.382 --> 59:15.182
Oh, God, forgive me
for my sins.

59:15.184 --> 59:16.653
- Choose me.
- Six.

59:17.786 --> 59:20.653
Don't do this. Please.

59:20.655 --> 59:21.787
Five.

59:21.789 --> 59:24.391
Four.

59:24.393 --> 59:26.626
Just stop it! Please.

59:26.628 --> 59:27.630
Three.

59:30.264 --> 59:32.099
- Just stop!
- Two.

59:32.101 --> 59:33.135
Me.

59:35.938 --> 59:36.972
What's that?

59:39.141 --> 59:40.577
Shoot me.

59:42.077 --> 59:43.279
Oh, I'm impressed.

59:44.278 --> 59:45.914
You finally got some balls.

59:47.248 --> 59:48.949
You know what?

59:48.951 --> 59:52.686
I'll give you one last chance
to change your mind.

59:52.688 --> 59:53.956
- Okay?
- He's right.

59:56.391 --> 59:57.793
He's right. I am a coward.

01:00:00.262 --> 01:00:02.028
I've been a coward
my whole life.

01:00:04.266 --> 01:00:05.735
Always running away.

01:00:06.735 --> 01:00:07.937
Always afraid.

01:00:11.005 --> 01:00:13.241
- But I'm not afraid now.
- Yeah.

01:00:14.275 --> 01:00:15.941
Well, look at the bright side.

01:00:15.943 --> 01:00:17.811
At least you don't have to go
door to door no more.

01:00:17.813 --> 01:00:18.815
I was raped.

01:00:20.882 --> 01:00:24.251
In college. At a frat party.

01:00:24.253 --> 01:00:26.052
I was smart enough
to get a scholarship

01:00:26.054 --> 01:00:28.954
and dumb enough to believe
this guy cared about me.

01:00:28.956 --> 01:00:30.222
I went upstairs with him.

01:00:30.224 --> 01:00:32.358
And the music was so loud.

01:00:32.360 --> 01:00:35.429
I remember his weight
and I remember I couldn't move

01:00:35.431 --> 01:00:36.996
and I couldn't breathe.

01:00:36.998 --> 01:00:38.432
Felt like a coffin.

01:00:38.434 --> 01:00:40.032
So I turned him in
to the president.

01:00:40.034 --> 01:00:43.036
And it was his word
against mine.

01:00:43.038 --> 01:00:44.771
And he said it was consensual.

01:00:44.773 --> 01:00:48.177
And when I wouldn't let it go,
they expelled me.

01:00:50.713 --> 01:00:51.848
So I left.

01:00:52.313 --> 01:00:53.847
And I gave up.

01:00:53.849 --> 01:00:57.016
And I was mad,
and I was...

01:00:57.018 --> 01:01:00.019
And then I found out
that I was pregnant.

01:01:00.021 --> 01:01:01.824
And I wanted to...

01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:14.703
But I didn't. No.

01:01:16.204 --> 01:01:18.807
And they came...
And when I saw her,

01:01:20.275 --> 01:01:25.278
they put her in my arms,
she was so small and real.

01:01:25.280 --> 01:01:27.450
She needed me
to take care of her.

01:01:29.351 --> 01:01:30.452
So...

01:01:33.989 --> 01:01:34.990
Baby...

01:01:39.862 --> 01:01:42.461
Baby, Tom is

01:01:42.463 --> 01:01:46.532
the man you think is your father,
he was my first husband.

01:01:46.534 --> 01:01:48.501
And the truth is
he doesn't pay child support

01:01:48.503 --> 01:01:49.905
because he doesn't have to.

01:01:51.306 --> 01:01:53.305
He doesn't have to.
When we separated,

01:01:53.307 --> 01:01:55.075
he said he wanted
to keep seeing you

01:01:55.077 --> 01:01:57.010
and I said yes.

01:01:57.012 --> 01:01:59.146
And he was helping us out,
but then he remarried

01:01:59.148 --> 01:02:00.780
and he just couldn't.

01:02:00.782 --> 01:02:02.382
He's a good man.

01:02:02.384 --> 01:02:04.086
I lied to you, baby.

01:02:08.056 --> 01:02:11.992
Your real father does not want
to have anything to do with you.

01:02:11.994 --> 01:02:14.494
And I'm sorry I lied

01:02:14.496 --> 01:02:16.164
and I'm a coward.

01:02:17.199 --> 01:02:18.434
You're not a coward, Mom.

01:02:20.001 --> 01:02:21.267
I forgive you.

01:02:21.269 --> 01:02:23.970
That doesn't
change anything anyway.

01:02:23.972 --> 01:02:27.744
Because David has already agreed
to go the Jesus route.

01:02:29.110 --> 01:02:31.847
- No one agreed to anything.
- It's okay.

01:02:34.048 --> 01:02:36.251
See? He wants this.

01:02:37.820 --> 01:02:39.122
He's okay with it.

01:02:41.389 --> 01:02:42.491
Aren't you, David?

01:02:45.960 --> 01:02:47.260
Baby...

01:02:47.262 --> 01:02:49.030
Do you even know
how to use that, shy one?

01:02:50.932 --> 01:02:52.268
You put that down, right now.

01:03:02.844 --> 01:03:05.247
Will you stop it, darlin'?
You're turning me on.

01:03:13.121 --> 01:03:14.923
I just love a woman
who can wrestle.

01:03:31.440 --> 01:03:32.575
Get off her!

01:03:38.380 --> 01:03:39.816
Who the fuck are you?

01:03:40.581 --> 01:03:41.917
Cheyenne.

01:03:44.585 --> 01:03:47.088
- Who the fuck are you?
- David.

01:03:48.456 --> 01:03:50.389
What the hell's happening here?

01:03:50.391 --> 01:03:53.293
- Rainy?
- We had some issues.

01:03:53.295 --> 01:03:54.927
You had some issues?

01:03:54.929 --> 01:03:56.528
What the fuck's going on?
What's...

01:03:56.530 --> 01:03:58.632
What's going on with Jawari?

01:03:58.634 --> 01:04:01.501
We got into it and, uh,
I accidentally killed him.

01:04:01.503 --> 01:04:03.168
- That's not true.
- Shut up, Audrey.

01:04:03.170 --> 01:04:04.970
You don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

01:04:04.972 --> 01:04:07.539
- Where's the old man?
- He's dead.

01:04:07.541 --> 01:04:09.508
Fuck! I told you
not to kill him!

01:04:09.510 --> 01:04:10.913
He was already dead.

01:04:11.445 --> 01:04:13.179
He died four days ago.

01:04:13.181 --> 01:04:15.117
Yeah, the will
doesn't get read 'til next week.

01:04:16.385 --> 01:04:18.952
Why is this asshole
pointing a gun at you?

01:04:18.954 --> 01:04:21.253
'Cause he got it while I was
wrestling with Audrey.

01:04:21.255 --> 01:04:23.158
She's probably gonna
get the water rights next week.

01:04:25.494 --> 01:04:28.628
Well, you know what we can do?

01:04:28.630 --> 01:04:32.201
Just have her sign real quick and we'll
just get out of here like nothing happened.

01:04:32.668 --> 01:04:34.233
Hey, put it down.

01:04:34.235 --> 01:04:36.302
Drop it.
Don't point at me. Down,

01:04:36.304 --> 01:04:37.938
Other side. Come on.

01:04:37.940 --> 01:04:40.610
Fuck around.
Push it. Push it.

01:04:43.978 --> 01:04:46.147
Rainy, get your gun.

01:04:47.048 --> 01:04:48.215
Rifle.

01:04:48.217 --> 01:04:50.887
I don't give a fat fuck
if it's Jawari's dick. Get it!

01:04:52.420 --> 01:04:53.556
Untie her.

01:04:59.661 --> 01:05:02.329
Here we go.

01:05:02.331 --> 01:05:05.565
Now, what you may not realize is
that all wills are retroactive.

01:05:05.567 --> 01:05:07.733
Ownership legally begins

01:05:07.735 --> 01:05:10.672
the moment the decedent dies.

01:05:12.440 --> 01:05:13.975
Here you go. That was easy.

01:05:15.710 --> 01:05:16.978
I'm on my way.

01:05:18.981 --> 01:05:20.347
But you clean up this mess.

01:05:20.349 --> 01:05:22.648
We were promised
we'd be let go.

01:05:22.650 --> 01:05:24.383
You were promised
you'd be let go?

01:05:24.385 --> 01:05:26.219
Well, listen, I want everything
to go real smooth here,

01:05:26.221 --> 01:05:28.320
but this guy's
a real fucking asshole.

01:05:30.092 --> 01:05:32.025
Rainy, do what you gotta do.

01:05:32.027 --> 01:05:33.559
Whoa! Whoa!

01:05:33.561 --> 01:05:35.195
Cheyenne!

01:05:35.197 --> 01:05:36.996
- Shit! Go!
- Go!

01:05:36.998 --> 01:05:38.333
Go! Go! I got him.

01:05:48.543 --> 01:05:50.613
Whoa.

01:05:58.519 --> 01:06:00.220
Boo!

01:06:00.222 --> 01:06:01.722
I'm gonna miss you, Audrey.

01:06:01.724 --> 01:06:05.291
This is the most excitement I've had
since my daddy tried to drown me.

01:06:05.293 --> 01:06:08.297
Well, that and killing
my ex-girlfriend.

01:06:10.164 --> 01:06:11.563
I got 'em!

01:06:11.565 --> 01:06:13.432
I have a gun, too.

01:06:13.434 --> 01:06:16.706
Audrey, I'm disappointed in you.

01:06:17.405 --> 01:06:18.507
This is a rifle.

01:06:20.242 --> 01:06:22.644
I'm sorry, you have a rifle

01:06:23.344 --> 01:06:24.644
and I have a gun.

01:06:24.646 --> 01:06:26.079
Yeah, thank you.

01:06:26.081 --> 01:06:28.113
But what you don't have
is the balls.

01:06:28.115 --> 01:06:29.518
Ah.

01:06:31.119 --> 01:06:32.722
- Ow, it's hot.
- Let's go.

01:06:34.422 --> 01:06:35.457
Audrey!

01:06:40.528 --> 01:06:43.063
Go. Go hide.

01:06:43.065 --> 01:06:44.500
I'm impressed, Audrey.

01:06:46.568 --> 01:06:47.770
I misjudged you.

01:06:48.570 --> 01:06:50.804
Doesn't happen often.

01:06:50.806 --> 01:06:53.041
Forgot I was dealing with
a high school valedictorian.

01:06:56.677 --> 01:06:58.047
You got guts, Audrey.

01:06:59.246 --> 01:07:00.449
And you're smart.

01:07:02.384 --> 01:07:04.119
That's a dangerous combination.

01:07:09.858 --> 01:07:12.525
You could have killed me.

01:07:12.527 --> 01:07:14.563
But you don't have the kind of
guts it takes to kill a man.

01:07:16.697 --> 01:07:17.732
It's something in the eyes.

01:07:25.407 --> 01:07:27.543
I sure hope shy one wasn't
up in the loft.

01:07:29.744 --> 01:07:31.247
Where did you go, Audrey?

01:07:32.246 --> 01:07:34.179
Huh?

01:07:34.181 --> 01:07:36.084
Did you go off into those woods?

01:07:44.759 --> 01:07:46.661
I'm gonna bury you
with this shovel, Audrey.

01:07:53.201 --> 01:07:55.237
Cheyenne, let's go.

01:07:56.570 --> 01:07:57.639
Come on.

01:08:01.476 --> 01:08:02.644
Let's go.

01:08:11.552 --> 01:08:13.855
Wait a minute,
I remember this.

01:08:16.725 --> 01:08:18.160
This is the reservoir.

01:08:18.859 --> 01:08:20.127
Okay.

01:08:22.564 --> 01:08:24.399
- What happened to it?
- I don't know.

01:08:25.466 --> 01:08:27.200
The creek.

01:08:27.202 --> 01:08:28.600
It's got to be right up here.

01:08:28.603 --> 01:08:29.604
Come on, let's go.

01:08:51.893 --> 01:08:53.362
I'm tired of fucking around.

01:08:55.831 --> 01:09:00.399
Please. You're not really gonna let him
kill that woman and her little girl?

01:09:00.402 --> 01:09:04.269
Yeah. Well, you're next
if it makes you feel any better.

01:09:04.270 --> 01:09:07.876
Wonder if it's too late to file in
with Water Resources Department.

01:09:10.212 --> 01:09:13.245
Girl's probably gonna grow up
to be a nobody, anyway.

01:09:13.247 --> 01:09:15.615
Especially in this town.

01:09:15.617 --> 01:09:16.950
Come on.

01:09:16.952 --> 01:09:19.622
Hey. Hey,
how late are you guys open?

01:09:21.221 --> 01:09:23.322
Okay. And how long
does it take to

01:09:23.323 --> 01:09:25.225
process transfer
of water rights?

01:09:26.895 --> 01:09:28.663
All right, so I couldn't do it
if I went in today?

01:09:29.898 --> 01:09:31.298
If I went in first thing
in the morning,

01:09:31.300 --> 01:09:34.267
could I do it by the end of the
day, get it in my company's name?

01:09:34.269 --> 01:09:36.501
I could? By the end of the day?

01:09:36.502 --> 01:09:38.971
All right, I'll do that.
Uh, I'll be there at 9:00 a.m.

01:09:38.974 --> 01:09:40.242
What's your name?

01:09:40.774 --> 01:09:42.508
Karen?

01:09:42.510 --> 01:09:43.779
Karen, thank you for the help.

01:09:44.511 --> 01:09:45.581
I will...

01:09:47.349 --> 01:09:48.484
I'll see you then.

01:09:53.822 --> 01:09:55.257
Where the fuck are you going?

01:09:58.460 --> 01:10:00.195
Trying to make a break for it?

01:10:01.662 --> 01:10:03.896
Should have shot you
right when I saw you.

01:10:03.898 --> 01:10:06.598
- Get up.
- Burn in hell!

01:10:06.600 --> 01:10:08.968
Fuck!

01:10:15.644 --> 01:10:17.376
Goddamn it!

01:11:15.569 --> 01:11:18.036
So we have to cross it?

01:11:18.038 --> 01:11:19.541
I don't think we have a choice.

01:11:21.076 --> 01:11:22.442
Okay.

01:11:22.444 --> 01:11:23.779
I just want to get out of here.

01:11:28.550 --> 01:11:29.618
I'm scared.

01:11:30.851 --> 01:11:32.518
I know you are.

01:11:32.520 --> 01:11:35.024
- We'll be across before you know it.
- Okay.

01:11:55.042 --> 01:11:56.344
Creek.

01:12:04.051 --> 01:12:05.554
- Mom.
- It's okay.

01:12:14.128 --> 01:12:15.463
Okay.

01:12:22.537 --> 01:12:23.905
I got you, okay?

01:12:27.509 --> 01:12:28.543
Climb.

01:12:29.676 --> 01:12:30.712
Good girl.

01:12:31.813 --> 01:12:33.681
Good girl. Take my hand.

01:12:36.984 --> 01:12:38.619
Mom! Mom!

01:12:39.621 --> 01:12:40.622
Mom!

01:12:44.057 --> 01:12:45.458
Mom!

01:12:46.795 --> 01:12:47.796
Mom!

01:12:48.997 --> 01:12:49.998
Come on up.

01:12:51.932 --> 01:12:52.935
Mom.

01:13:04.912 --> 01:13:06.514
- Are you okay?
- I am.

01:13:07.948 --> 01:13:09.648
I think Dad was a jerk.

01:13:09.650 --> 01:13:11.153
It's all right. It's all right.

01:13:13.654 --> 01:13:14.719
Let's go.

01:13:14.721 --> 01:13:16.589
What do we have here?

01:13:16.591 --> 01:13:18.160
This is a regular reunion.

01:13:19.894 --> 01:13:21.193
I would appreciate it

01:13:21.195 --> 01:13:24.729
if you would stop pointing that
gun at my daughter's face.

01:13:24.731 --> 01:13:27.732
Audrey, how many times
do I have to tell you

01:13:27.734 --> 01:13:29.602
that this is a rifle?

01:13:29.604 --> 01:13:31.140
Cheyenne, it's not hot now.

01:13:32.140 --> 01:13:33.638
What are you two talking about?

01:13:33.640 --> 01:13:35.808
- Push it up.
- When?

01:13:35.810 --> 01:13:37.746
Now.

01:14:02.069 --> 01:14:03.568
Watch out.

01:14:03.570 --> 01:14:04.706
What are we gonna do?

01:14:05.539 --> 01:14:06.875
There has to be two shots.

01:14:11.011 --> 01:14:12.046
Let's go.

01:14:36.104 --> 01:14:37.836
Yeah?

01:14:37.838 --> 01:14:39.975
Hey. Hey, Grandpa, it's Bobby.

01:14:40.875 --> 01:14:41.877
Yeah?

01:14:42.844 --> 01:14:43.878
I was sleeping.

01:14:44.746 --> 01:14:45.780
I know. This is important.

01:14:46.314 --> 01:14:47.713
Really?

01:14:47.715 --> 01:14:49.815
I did it.
I got the water rights.

01:14:49.817 --> 01:14:52.087
Bullshit. I don't believe it.

01:14:53.220 --> 01:14:54.689
No, I promise. I did it.

01:14:56.056 --> 01:14:57.192
<i>The old man died.</i>

01:14:59.560 --> 01:15:00.561
He died?

01:15:02.829 --> 01:15:04.565
He died and you didn't tell me?

01:15:06.100 --> 01:15:08.770
Jesus Christ, I...

01:15:09.770 --> 01:15:12.037
I... I could have sent flowers.

01:15:12.039 --> 01:15:14.609
Or I might even gone.

01:15:15.842 --> 01:15:17.813
You gotta tell me
this stuff, Bobby.

01:15:18.779 --> 01:15:20.181
I got his granddaughter to sign.

01:15:21.349 --> 01:15:22.618
<i>Which one?</i>

01:15:23.685 --> 01:15:24.720
<i>Who cares?</i>

01:15:26.119 --> 01:15:29.287
Who cares?
There's two, Bobby.

01:15:29.289 --> 01:15:30.889
And they're not twins.

01:15:30.891 --> 01:15:32.126
So which one?

01:15:35.229 --> 01:15:36.231
Audrey.

01:15:37.030 --> 01:15:38.065
Audrey.

01:15:39.067 --> 01:15:40.368
Yeah, that was the little one.

01:15:42.970 --> 01:15:46.240
Audrey's the one who always used
to monkey around with my beard.

01:15:48.042 --> 01:15:51.876
Who cares? Who cares? I got them done.
Got it signed.

01:15:51.878 --> 01:15:53.948
<i>You didn't hurt her,
did you, Bobby?</i>

01:15:55.917 --> 01:15:58.384
No. Of course not.

01:15:58.386 --> 01:16:02.687
<i>I'd be extremely unhappy
if you hurt her.</i>

01:16:02.689 --> 01:16:04.190
<i>Or anything happened to her.</i>

01:16:04.192 --> 01:16:06.627
- Audrey's fine.
- She better be.

01:16:08.363 --> 01:16:10.763
Fuck Audrey!
I did it. I did it.

01:16:10.765 --> 01:16:12.234
<i>What did you just say?</i>

01:16:13.900 --> 01:16:16.805
Make no mistake about
who's about to tell you this.

01:16:18.139 --> 01:16:20.876
You don't ever
speak to me like that.

01:16:21.943 --> 01:16:24.943
- Got it?
- I'm sorry.

01:16:24.945 --> 01:16:26.079
I did it... I didn't mean it.

01:16:26.081 --> 01:16:31.116
I just meant that I...
I... I'm excited to tell you.

01:16:31.118 --> 01:16:32.384
This is great news.

01:16:32.386 --> 01:16:35.023
We get the water rights
transferred tomorrow.

01:16:35.722 --> 01:16:37.723
Well...

01:16:37.725 --> 01:16:40.992
I think you better
understand one thing.

01:16:40.994 --> 01:16:44.065
You're the first in line.
And if you screw this up,

01:16:45.265 --> 01:16:46.768
you're done here.

01:16:48.403 --> 01:16:49.771
I didn't screw it up.

01:16:50.971 --> 01:16:53.371
I got it done.

01:16:53.373 --> 01:16:55.844
Rainy, we gotta get out of here.

01:16:57.145 --> 01:16:59.181
Clean it up.
We get out of here before dark.

01:17:00.047 --> 01:17:01.680
Ah.

01:17:01.682 --> 01:17:03.249
Hang up the phone.

01:17:03.251 --> 01:17:04.753
What's going on, Bobby?

01:17:07.822 --> 01:17:10.057
Nothing. I gotta call you back.

01:17:11.359 --> 01:17:14.427
Bobby. What's going on?

01:17:14.429 --> 01:17:15.730
I'll call you back.

01:17:20.234 --> 01:17:23.402
No one told you
to put it in the satchel.

01:17:23.404 --> 01:17:25.370
Did you want to make a call? I'll
give you... I'll give you my phone.

01:17:25.372 --> 01:17:26.942
Don't.

01:17:28.341 --> 01:17:30.175
I didn't kill anybody.

01:17:30.177 --> 01:17:32.780
I didn't kill anybody.
That wasn't me.

01:17:33.448 --> 01:17:34.946
I wouldn't do that.

01:17:34.948 --> 01:17:37.183
I just wanted you
to sign these papers.

01:17:37.185 --> 01:17:39.054
I never really fucking do that.
I never do.

01:17:39.820 --> 01:17:41.053
I swear to God.

01:17:41.055 --> 01:17:43.388
Do you have any idea what
you've done to me and my kid,

01:17:43.390 --> 01:17:44.792
you greedy fuck?

01:17:51.798 --> 01:17:53.068
I want you to make a choice.

01:17:55.970 --> 01:17:58.006
Very slowly, I want you
to reach in there,

01:17:59.974 --> 01:18:01.176
and if you wanna live,

01:18:02.944 --> 01:18:04.046
you'll take out the phone.

01:18:06.079 --> 01:18:07.314
If you wanna die,

01:18:09.417 --> 01:18:10.819
you'll take out the gun.

01:18:13.787 --> 01:18:14.789
I don't wanna die.

01:18:16.791 --> 01:18:17.859
I'll give you the phone.

01:18:19.327 --> 01:18:21.896
There's no
sense in more violence.

01:18:47.020 --> 01:18:48.155
Cheyenne!

01:18:51.259 --> 01:18:53.127
Come on out, baby.
It's okay.

01:18:58.032 --> 01:18:59.565
Love you.

01:18:59.567 --> 01:19:01.036
I love you, too.

01:19:41.876 --> 01:19:46.314
And so, this concludes
his last will and testimony.

01:19:47.215 --> 01:19:50.014
The house is officially yours.

01:19:50.016 --> 01:19:53.619
I don't know if you want to live there
now or not, given all that's happened.

01:19:53.621 --> 01:19:55.422
But it's yours to deal with
as you please.

01:19:56.990 --> 01:19:58.092
Any questions?

01:20:01.061 --> 01:20:03.331
I didn't hear you mention
anything about the water rights.

01:20:04.164 --> 01:20:06.365
Water rights?

01:20:06.367 --> 01:20:09.869
Your grandfather got his water
from the district.

01:20:09.871 --> 01:20:12.204
Grandpa had his water gravity
fed from the creek.

01:20:12.206 --> 01:20:15.574
I remember playing in the
reservoir when I was a kid.

01:20:15.576 --> 01:20:18.343
Well, when you were
a child, maybe,

01:20:18.345 --> 01:20:21.880
but, he switched to
district water, 20 years ago.

01:20:21.882 --> 01:20:24.019
He was too old
to maintain the pipes.

01:20:25.252 --> 01:20:27.518
So, who owns the water rights?

01:20:27.520 --> 01:20:29.153
The state.

01:20:29.155 --> 01:20:30.923
The law is that

01:20:30.925 --> 01:20:33.491
if water rights aren't exercised
for five years or more,

01:20:33.493 --> 01:20:34.962
they go into forfeiture.

01:20:36.430 --> 01:20:39.598
- Did Grandpa know this?
- I don't know.

01:20:39.600 --> 01:20:42.934
He would have been almost 80
when it went into forfeiture.

01:20:42.936 --> 01:20:47.272
Good chance that he couldn't
read or understand notices.

01:20:47.274 --> 01:20:51.143
So Grandpa couldn't have sold those
water rights even if he wanted to?

01:20:51.145 --> 01:20:54.245
He could have gotten them
from the state. Anyone could.

01:20:54.247 --> 01:20:56.884
Anyone? They were
up for grabs for anyone?

01:20:58.118 --> 01:20:59.153
Yes, anyone.

01:21:04.492 --> 01:21:05.627
Are you okay?

01:21:07.295 --> 01:21:08.296
Audrey?

01:21:11.564 --> 01:21:14.098
Are you all right?

01:21:14.100 --> 01:21:17.037
It's all right. You can sell off
some of the trees to the saw mill.

01:21:17.671 --> 01:21:19.073
That should get you by.

01:21:19.573 --> 01:21:20.942
You're okay.

01:21:22.676 --> 01:21:24.378
All they had to do was ask.

01:21:30.083 --> 01:21:31.519
All they had to do was ask.

01:21:57.480 --> 01:22:02.480
