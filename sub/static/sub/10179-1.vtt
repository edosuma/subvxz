02:10.782 --> 02:12.647
B-7

02:21.574 --> 02:23.403
G-46

02:28.000 --> 02:31.170
Before the cops nabbed me, I stashed cash.

02:31.746 --> 02:32.910
Millions.

02:32.989 --> 02:34.808
Hey! Sit down!

02:35.409 --> 02:37.142
Did you hear me? Millions!

02:37.177 --> 02:39.761
Can't you see I'm on a roll here?

02:40.400 --> 02:42.576
Come on, Penguin. Hear me out!

02:42.717 --> 02:44.164
Ahem!

02:46.556 --> 02:48.481
Bingo! Hur..

02:54.386 --> 02:56.137
N-17

02:56.128 --> 02:57.540
It was thirty years in the slammer and

02:57.603 --> 02:59.103
ten here in Arkham.
(Bingo!)

02:59.137 --> 03:00.310
But the fact is,

03:00.312 --> 03:04.000
I cannot take one more day in the cuckoo's nest.

03:04.000 --> 03:07.370
I am willing to split the take 50-50,

03:09.100 --> 03:12.144
if, you can get us out of here.

03:12.270 --> 03:16.000
And where might we retrieve our little nest egg?

03:16.152 --> 03:19.047
Gotham Cemetary, north end.

03:19.200 --> 03:22.300
The crypt behind the tombstone with the cross.

03:23.343 --> 03:25.600
But I think I'll keep more specific directions

03:25.600 --> 03:27.772
to myself until we get there.

03:27.772 --> 03:28.809
Together.

03:28.809 --> 03:32.588
You don't have to worry about trusting me, old pal.

03:32.588 --> 03:35.289
I'm as dependable as the dodo.

03:35.262 --> 03:37.162
I knew you were rock solid, Penguin.

03:37.243 --> 03:39.141
Not like that other guy.

03:40.246 --> 03:41.900
You told someone else?

03:41.900 --> 03:44.800
Well, first I went to the only one who's escaped

03:44.800 --> 03:46.010
from here more times than you.

03:46.010 --> 03:46.717
Who?

03:46.717 --> 03:47.526
Take it easy!

03:47.584 --> 03:49.350
I don't think he got what I was telling him.

03:49.350 --> 03:50.573
Who, who, who??

03:50.600 --> 03:53.700
I mean, talk about having a real screw loose, right?

03:55.302 --> 03:57.523
You told him?

03:59.100 --> 04:01.317
Joker! He's escaped!

04:09.300 --> 04:11.439
Goodbye Arkham,

04:12.174 --> 04:14.953
hello, Gotham!

04:22.287 --> 04:24.554
That crook loop's got the step on me!

04:24.600 --> 04:25.900
Come on, come on!

04:26.400 --> 04:27.571
That means you!

04:29.300 --> 04:30.756
Ooh, it's Joker!

04:30.957 --> 04:32.257
Where?

04:47.800 --> 04:49.397
Bingo.

05:33.300 --> 05:35.351
Tweet, tweet.

05:36.300 --> 05:38.548
Penguin, you old featherbrain.

05:38.600 --> 05:41.000
What brings you out of Arkham?

05:41.000 --> 05:42.747
Same as you, clowny.

05:42.903 --> 05:45.300
But I think we can save each other a whole lot of

05:45.300 --> 05:49.300
trouble if we agree to split the take.

05:49.800 --> 05:51.432
See your point.

05:51.630 --> 05:53.606
Partners?

06:08.900 --> 06:12.972
My, Pengy. You really know how to shake!

06:25.500 --> 06:28.752
Instant karma, Joker.

06:45.000 --> 06:48.128
Don't get caught in the rain without your straitjacket.

06:48.500 --> 06:51.963
Batsy, you're such a card.

07:08.600 --> 07:11.402
Gotham Cemetary.

07:19.700 --> 07:21.700
A casket, a casket

07:21.700 --> 07:24.746
which crypt's got the money casket?

07:28.200 --> 07:29.300
No sign.

07:29.300 --> 07:31.106
Tombstone with a cross,

07:31.141 --> 07:33.800
tombstone with a...

08:04.700 --> 08:06.461
Catch!

08:39.000 --> 08:40.710
Give it up.

08:53.500 --> 08:57.428
This time I'm out for bloody, Batsy.

09:03.700 --> 09:06.300
It's behind the cross.

09:06.300 --> 09:08.083
This must be the place.

09:10.100 --> 09:14.111
I'll take what's behind door number 1.

09:33.500 --> 09:34.900
Whoa.

09:34.900 --> 09:37.000
Like that will stop me.

09:46.493 --> 09:49.122
Show me the money.

10:05.300 --> 10:07.146
I'm bleeding!

10:17.200 --> 10:21.432
This isn't paydirt, it's just dirt!

10:35.600 --> 10:38.355
Where is that loot?!

11:22.400 --> 11:23.852
What's that?

11:57.600 --> 11:59.208
Show's over.

12:01.600 --> 12:04.363
The show must go on.

12:13.900 --> 12:17.508
You wouldn't leave your pal hanging,
now would you?

12:24.600 --> 12:26.400
Almost had you!

12:26.500 --> 12:29.512
Bye bye, Batsy!

13:45.100 --> 13:47.306
Hey! Cemetary's closed!

14:04.955 --> 14:07.581
That will do.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.555
Looks like I'm the main course.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.500
Dead guys don't do that!

14:41.526 --> 14:46.216
Not dead. Undead.

14:47.200 --> 14:50.562
I think I need to unwet my pants.

14:54.700 --> 14:57.800
I will require a human servant.

14:58.000 --> 15:02.606
A sentinel to guard my coffin while I sleep.

15:03.500 --> 15:04.954
You.

15:06.500 --> 15:07.600
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa.

15:07.600 --> 15:10.024
I'll have you know, Sir,

15:10.100 --> 15:12.100
I am a Cobblepot.

15:12.100 --> 15:16.173
And Cobblepots do not serve.

15:29.500 --> 15:32.722
I'm Penguin, I'll be your server.

15:54.100 --> 15:56.800
I shall darn that straight away, Sir.

15:57.800 --> 16:00.623
Sir? You are brooding.

16:01.640 --> 16:03.336
More so than usual.

16:03.641 --> 16:05.112
Alfred.

16:05.413 --> 16:07.731
Tonight, Joker met his demise.

16:09.927 --> 16:13.100
And our old friend, Cobblepot?

16:13.285 --> 16:16.647
Penguin's trail went completely cold.

16:20.300 --> 16:23.235
I have been at rest for quite some time.

16:23.700 --> 16:26.696
Transylvania has changed.

16:26.731 --> 16:28.000
Oh, O Dark One,

16:28.000 --> 16:30.816
you're not in Transylvania anymore.

16:30.816 --> 16:33.535
This is Gotham City.

16:37.500 --> 16:43.400
Then if I am no longer in Transylvania,
near my castle,

16:43.400 --> 16:48.000
it must be due to forces outside my control.

16:48.000 --> 16:52.766
Events which occurred, following my death.

16:55.400 --> 16:58.600
It seems, after I was vanquished,

16:58.600 --> 17:05.060
my remains were relocated, far from Transylvania.

17:07.500 --> 17:09.155
Very well.

17:10.000 --> 17:14.723
Now take me on a tour of this Gotham,
native guide.

17:15.300 --> 17:20.539
The night is young, and still I thirst.

17:32.800 --> 17:34.800
Wayne Industries feels an obligation

17:34.900 --> 17:38.100
to remain committed to socially responsible programs.

17:38.100 --> 17:39.100
A prime example would be

17:39.100 --> 17:41.600
our work in the field of alternative energy sources.

17:41.600 --> 17:43.000
Amazing.

17:43.000 --> 17:45.650
Well, I like to think we're just doing our part.

17:45.650 --> 17:48.110
I mean, you've been here nearly 40 minutes

17:48.110 --> 17:49.913
and haven't bolted for the door.

17:51.100 --> 17:53.800
My work sometimes calls me away.

17:53.900 --> 17:54.700
Well Bruce,

17:54.700 --> 17:55.800
I'm sure you can imagine

17:55.800 --> 17:57.500
how four false starts at an interview

17:57.500 --> 18:00.200
might make a reporter feel rejected.

18:00.200 --> 18:01.900
Now I have a question for you, Vicki.

18:01.900 --> 18:02.672
Shoot.

18:03.500 --> 18:04.674
Where's your camera man?

18:05.700 --> 18:08.710
I, uh, gave him the day off.

18:08.701 --> 18:09.200
Figured that way,

18:09.200 --> 18:11.000
Gotham TV News might have a better shot

18:11.000 --> 18:13.700
at getting to know the real Bruce Wayne.

18:13.700 --> 18:15.400
Gotham TV News, or

18:15.400 --> 18:17.000
Vicki Vale?

18:17.000 --> 18:18.400
Well, I'm not the one who

18:18.400 --> 18:21.200
picked a restaurant with such a beautiful view.

18:30.100 --> 18:31.600
I'm sorry, Vicki.

18:32.000 --> 18:32.850
Would you believe,

18:32.850 --> 18:34.383
I have to wrap this up.

18:35.500 --> 18:36.700
That was professional, Vale.

18:37.000 --> 18:38.160
No it's, it's not that.

18:38.356 --> 18:40.800
I still have a ton of things
to prepare for the energy expo

18:40.800 --> 18:44.700
at the mansion tomorrow night.
Why don't you come?

18:44.900 --> 18:46.875
But my story airs tomorrow morning.

18:47.382 --> 18:49.419
I meant as my date.

18:55.200 --> 18:56.679
The tally of missing persons

18:56.679 --> 18:59.360
has spiked dramatically in Gotham this past week.

18:59.360 --> 19:02.800
With the Gotham PD no closer
to uncovering who or what

19:02.800 --> 19:07.200
might be behind the mysterious
disappearances of these "Lost Ones",

19:07.200 --> 19:10.000
a cloud of fear hangs over our city.

19:10.000 --> 19:12.943
Gotham PD aren't the only ones who're baffled.

19:14.100 --> 19:16.700
Might the missing Penguin be behind this?

19:16.700 --> 19:19.000
No ransom demands, not his style.

19:19.000 --> 19:20.700
And speaking of news,

19:20.800 --> 19:23.858
how was your dinner with the lovely Vicki Vale?

19:25.100 --> 19:27.800
Short, but sweet.

19:27.900 --> 19:31.411
I invited her to the expo tomorrow night. And,

19:31.411 --> 19:32.910
to dinner here, Saturday.

19:32.910 --> 19:34.498
To think I was beginning to fear

19:34.498 --> 19:36.624
you prefered the company of archvillains.

19:38.900 --> 19:40.148
On that note,

19:40.371 --> 19:41.857
let's see if tonight turns up

19:41.857 --> 19:44.500
Penguin or any of these Lost Ones.

19:44.500 --> 19:45.900
I lost Joker,

19:45.900 --> 19:49.600
I'm not going to lose anyone else on my watch.

20:31.000 --> 20:32.500
My purse!

20:40.677 --> 20:42.400
A rent-a-cop?

20:43.766 --> 20:45.182
Whoa!

21:03.600 --> 21:04.878
Oh thank goodness.

21:05.000 --> 21:06.542
Guess I'm not needed.

21:06.671 --> 21:09.050
Did you find my bag?

23:02.700 --> 23:05.636
A man who dresses like a bat.

23:05.667 --> 23:07.100
Oh phsaw.

23:07.100 --> 23:08.900
The Batman may look the look,

23:08.900 --> 23:11.523
but he has none of your mojo.

23:11.800 --> 23:14.000
I am nonetheless intrigued.

23:14.000 --> 23:17.928
My legacy has been quite influencial.

23:21.600 --> 23:23.803
Vampires, Master Bruce?

23:23.743 --> 23:24.500
Are you certain

23:24.500 --> 23:26.904
you're not suffering from sleep deprivation?

23:26.979 --> 23:28.900
I don't want to believe it either, Alfred.

23:28.900 --> 23:30.376
But I know what I saw.

23:30.600 --> 23:31.830
Fangs.

23:32.250 --> 23:33.259
Poppycock.

23:33.294 --> 23:35.826
Easily purchased at any halloween superstore.

23:36.211 --> 23:38.227
It wasn't just the teeth.

23:39.800 --> 23:42.227
The way they moved, their eyes.

23:43.000 --> 23:44.200
They weren't human.

23:44.200 --> 23:45.700
Yes. Well, might I remind you

23:45.700 --> 23:47.263
before one urban legend

23:47.338 --> 23:49.203
becomes too obsessed with another,

23:49.263 --> 23:51.100
you are hosting the Wayne Industries

23:51.100 --> 23:54.061
energy expo here, tonight.

23:54.132 --> 23:57.800
With the ravishing Vicki Vale on your arm.

24:07.700 --> 24:11.314
Time for my master to rise and shine.

24:13.100 --> 24:16.100
Wakey-wake, it's nighty-night!

24:16.100 --> 24:20.021
You have places to be, people to bite.

24:33.528 --> 24:38.500
Those bloodshakes really work wonders
for your complexion.

24:38.500 --> 24:41.315
Rise, my children of the night.

24:41.375 --> 24:44.730
We shall take Gotham, human by human.

24:44.796 --> 24:47.500
Until our blood flows through its canals,

24:47.500 --> 24:54.085
transfiguring it into the city of the undead.

24:53.900 --> 24:56.672
As you execute my dark purpose,

24:56.712 --> 25:02.017
I shall stake my claim among Gotham's elite.

25:02.100 --> 25:04.100
Well if you're looking to be numero uno

25:04.100 --> 25:05.615
of the rich and famous,

25:05.661 --> 25:09.834
there's one bird you'll have to knock off its perch.

25:49.700 --> 25:50.100
You there,

25:50.100 --> 25:51.800
more napkins at the buffet.

25:51.800 --> 25:53.467
You, attend to the spill in the study.

25:54.834 --> 25:56.609
And you, Stipes,

25:57.117 --> 25:59.100
I realise this assignment may not be

25:59.100 --> 26:01.965
as big a priority to you as catching your next wave,

26:02.300 --> 26:04.878
but would you mind tucking in your shirt?

26:05.170 --> 26:07.443
Dude, come on, chill.

26:07.800 --> 26:09.522
Caviar chills.

26:09.584 --> 26:11.400
Alfred Pennyworth, serving captain,

26:11.400 --> 26:12.969
does nothing of the sort.

26:27.220 --> 26:29.589
Truly magnificent.

26:29.932 --> 26:31.499
Oh, my necklace?

26:31.599 --> 26:33.199
It's a family heirloom.

26:33.700 --> 26:35.309
And you are?

26:35.503 --> 26:39.553
Alucard. Doctor Alucard.

26:39.695 --> 26:41.029
Bruce Wayne.

26:41.104 --> 26:43.014
I don't believe we've met.

26:43.099 --> 26:44.436
I am new to Gotham,

26:44.487 --> 26:47.306
a recent transport from Eastern Europe.

26:47.381 --> 26:49.280
Really? What line of work are you in?

26:49.351 --> 26:51.013
Cultural anthropology.

26:51.079 --> 26:54.813
I am here to study your city's Batman.

26:54.884 --> 26:56.700
Our city's?

26:56.700 --> 26:59.368
You mean to tell me Budapest has a Dark Knight too?

26:59.443 --> 27:02.106
Rare instances have been documented

27:02.172 --> 27:04.977
of a man who assumes the likeness of a bat,

27:05.027 --> 27:08.404
in societies ancient as well as modern.

27:08.459 --> 27:09.893
And I believe,

27:09.961 --> 27:12.631
that while instilling fear by night,

27:12.681 --> 27:18.679
these beings cloak themselves as
normal members of society.

27:18.735 --> 27:20.220
Fascinating theory.

27:20.280 --> 27:23.100
Bats are fascinating creatures.

27:23.200 --> 27:25.459
As are you, Doctor.

27:25.521 --> 27:29.104
If you'll excuse us, we've got to circulate.

27:30.000 --> 27:32.377
Hmm, seems you've picked up
that he's my type, huh?

27:32.447 --> 27:34.500
Tall, dark, and weird?

27:36.400 --> 27:40.300
We spoke of my work, what of yours?

27:40.700 --> 27:42.398
Research and development.

27:42.528 --> 27:45.946
For instance, the Wayne Industries' SL5.

27:46.021 --> 27:48.095
It's the most efficient technology to date

27:48.180 --> 27:52.500
for collecting solar energy,
and storing it as true sunlight.

27:52.500 --> 27:56.500
It's about time science did something
positive with the sun.

27:56.500 --> 27:57.931
Hors d'oeuvres?

28:00.700 --> 28:05.535
Beef steak tartare, exquisite.

28:11.000 --> 28:13.704
I prefer my meat cooked.

28:15.782 --> 28:17.667
Some garlic shrimp?

28:19.200 --> 28:23.103
But you must, it really packs a punch.

28:32.000 --> 28:33.600
Please excuse me,

28:33.600 --> 28:38.384
I must find something with which to wash this down.

28:41.076 --> 28:44.160
Bruce? Are you alright?

28:44.260 --> 28:45.703
I'll be right back.

28:45.778 --> 28:48.220
There's something I need to attend to.

29:17.500 --> 29:18.600
Master Bruce.

29:18.600 --> 29:21.131
I know the night is terribly alluring to you,

29:21.211 --> 29:23.952
but Miss Vale is waiting for you.

29:27.234 --> 29:29.400
Sir! Is everything alright?

29:29.400 --> 29:30.225
Alfred?

29:30.857 --> 29:33.758
I don't remember how I got out here.

29:36.310 --> 29:38.789
Alucard.

29:39.596 --> 29:41.110
Sir?

29:42.500 --> 29:44.093
Master Bruce?

30:07.700 --> 30:09.392
You freaked me out.

30:09.800 --> 30:12.280
Looking for some munchies?

30:19.728 --> 30:23.766
You there. Circulate!

30:29.700 --> 30:31.235
Empty-handed?

30:31.310 --> 30:33.954
This time I am out for blood.

30:34.080 --> 30:36.450
Stipes! Mister Stipes.

30:36.450 --> 30:38.200
Now what is wrong with this picture?

30:38.200 --> 30:40.400
Correct. No cheese platter.

30:40.400 --> 30:43.300
Which means you are headed the wrong way.

30:43.300 --> 30:44.500
And look at yourself.

30:44.500 --> 30:49.509
Was I not clear the first... Oh dear.

30:56.376 --> 30:57.708
Oh, leaving before desert?

31:00.836 --> 31:02.470
I have had my fill.

31:02.934 --> 31:04.104
Though not of you.

31:04.811 --> 31:06.591
When might I see you again?

31:06.600 --> 31:07.750
Tomorrow morning.

31:07.750 --> 31:08.854
On Gotham TV News.

31:12.705 --> 31:14.072
Phew. Dodged that bullet.

31:14.789 --> 31:16.456
Sorry Vicki, I'll be right back.

31:32.909 --> 31:33.687
Master Bruce!

31:34.249 --> 31:36.995
The mirror, he had no reflection!

31:38.478 --> 31:39.948
Sir, did you hear me?

31:42.072 --> 31:43.511
Pardon me. Thanks.

31:48.218 --> 31:49.417
Whatever are you writing?

31:49.687 --> 31:51.032
His name.

31:51.600 --> 31:52.972
Alucard.

32:04.185 --> 32:05.099
So it would seem

32:05.209 --> 32:08.400
Gotham is not merely being visited by vampires-

32:09.105 --> 32:11.234
But the king of all vampires.

32:12.298 --> 32:13.841
Count Dracula.

32:15.835 --> 32:16.667
On the bright side,

32:16.902 --> 32:19.259
no corpses drained of blood have turned up.

32:19.479 --> 32:22.034
Which means Dracula hasn't slained anyone.

32:22.420 --> 32:23.087
Yet.

32:23.694 --> 32:25.062
And the dark side?

32:25.514 --> 32:27.714
If each of the lost ones in turn feeds on others-

32:27.880 --> 32:30.696
Their numbers will grow exponentially.

32:30.870 --> 32:32.631
Into an army of vampires.

32:34.201 --> 32:35.906
Stopping Dracula won't be enough.

32:36.306 --> 32:38.650
I need to rescue his victims.

32:38.650 --> 32:39.410
All of them.

32:39.410 --> 32:41.478
Before Gotham has a plague in its hands.

32:41.698 --> 32:43.820
Rescue vampires, Sir?

32:43.820 --> 32:46.600
Vampirism may be rooted in the supernatural,

32:46.600 --> 32:48.200
but it infects blood.

32:48.200 --> 32:49.950
And if it's transmitted like a disease,

32:49.950 --> 32:52.200
there's a chance it can be treated.

32:55.500 --> 32:56.229
We have the advantage

32:56.329 --> 32:59.088
of the largest old-school medical library in Gotham.

32:59.705 --> 33:01.759
Right here, under our roof.

33:02.516 --> 33:04.700
Yes. And it's always an honor

33:04.700 --> 33:06.350
to hunt for knowledge.

33:06.371 --> 33:08.459
Especially when it is courtesy

33:08.534 --> 33:10.709
of Doctor Thomas Wayne.

33:17.156 --> 33:20.054
What is it about you that keeps me coming back?

33:20.075 --> 33:24.806
Your boyish charm, hot bod, tons of money?

33:25.095 --> 33:27.117
If only I were shallow.

33:28.742 --> 33:32.785
There's something deeper,
bubbling below your surface.

33:33.200 --> 33:34.400
It's not hard to imagine

33:34.400 --> 33:38.600
why you're out to save the world
with science and all your charities.

33:38.600 --> 33:39.448
The question is,

33:39.659 --> 33:42.590
when will you let someone rescue you?

33:50.205 --> 33:51.344
Vicki Vale.

33:52.904 --> 33:54.353
What?

33:54.947 --> 33:56.437
I'm on my way.

34:00.394 --> 34:03.884
We just received exclusive
breaking news on the lost ones.

34:03.994 --> 34:05.526
Vicki Vale is live on the scene

34:05.511 --> 34:07.699
at downtown Gotham; here's her report.

34:07.715 --> 34:08.467
Fancy that.

34:08.437 --> 34:10.650
Two night owls on the same case.

34:10.650 --> 34:12.393
You are meant for each other.

34:14.167 --> 34:17.739
It seems Gotham PD may have new
information regarding

34:17.739 --> 34:19.594
the mysterious disappearances.

34:19.594 --> 34:22.580
Thanks to an eye witness who has this to say.

34:22.580 --> 34:24.252
I saw what got the guy.

34:24.252 --> 34:26.024
Saw it with my own two eyes.

34:26.024 --> 34:27.800
It was a bat.

34:27.800 --> 34:30.826
I saw a huge shadow of a bat-

34:31.052 --> 34:34.846
As such, Gotham PD has concluded that perpetrator

34:34.846 --> 34:38.042
behind these bizarre abductions is none other than

34:38.664 --> 34:39.677
the Batman.

34:41.545 --> 34:45.061
Well this could put a kink in the relationship.

34:52.838 --> 34:55.581
It's way past your bedtime, Sir.

34:55.620 --> 34:58.002
With more citizens vanishing every night,

34:58.052 --> 35:00.600
all we know is that the shadow of the bat

35:00.602 --> 35:03.600
now strikes fear not only in criminals,

35:03.600 --> 35:06.230
but in the hearts of all Gothamites.

35:06.753 --> 35:12.051
Mighty gracious of the Batman
to take all the blame for you.

35:12.114 --> 35:13.682
Sucker!

35:20.009 --> 35:22.786
You like? It's a plasma screen.

35:22.786 --> 35:24.880
You know, as in blood?

35:28.036 --> 35:29.425
Oh, the girl.

35:29.868 --> 35:34.100
You have been in the grave a long time, Master.

35:34.626 --> 35:37.066
Nice jugulars.

35:37.330 --> 35:42.756
Even her name possesses a mysterious allure.

35:43.033 --> 35:44.622
Vale.

35:44.995 --> 35:49.515
I think it's time to seek my bride.

35:57.100 --> 35:59.701
One of the first to vanish was a night watchman.

35:59.700 --> 36:01.606
At Gotham Cemetary.

36:02.500 --> 36:05.491
That seems as good a place as any
to catch a vampire.

36:05.491 --> 36:08.800
And do know that the windows and doors
of Wayne Mansion are not

36:08.800 --> 36:12.569
the only objects I enhanced with garlic.

36:27.700 --> 36:30.445
It's him. The Batman.

36:30.435 --> 36:33.496
Please, hurry. I don't want to be a lost one.

36:33.521 --> 36:35.300
Attention all SWAT units.

36:35.300 --> 36:39.104
We have a Batman sighting in the
vincinity of Gotham Cemetary.

36:51.500 --> 36:53.799
Graveyards may not wash.

36:53.905 --> 36:57.362
Not if vampires have an aversion to crosses.

39:05.200 --> 39:07.900
So the folk tales are true.

39:08.481 --> 39:10.900
There is another bat in Gotham.

39:10.900 --> 39:13.514
Count Dracula, I presume.

39:13.999 --> 39:18.118
A legend, you are apparently intimate with.

39:18.118 --> 39:19.813
Don't flatter yourself.

39:19.813 --> 39:22.335
We cast kindred shadows,

39:22.335 --> 39:24.101
have you not seen the news?

39:24.101 --> 39:25.510
I don't harm people.

39:25.510 --> 39:27.910
You have no concept of the harm

39:27.910 --> 39:32.076
of which I am capable,
if only because I really hate

39:32.076 --> 39:37.894
to waste a life when it can be
spent in servitude to me.

39:37.894 --> 39:40.300
Life, or living death?

39:40.300 --> 39:42.003
To become vampire,

39:42.003 --> 39:45.000
is to heighten all of one's senses.

39:45.000 --> 39:49.400
To attain speed, strength, and immortality.

40:02.300 --> 40:04.594
Dripping with garlic.

40:08.000 --> 40:11.242
I shall most certainly steer clear of those.

40:52.300 --> 40:56.527
Try as you may, you cannot outbat me.

41:23.600 --> 41:26.224
Join me, Batman.

41:27.800 --> 41:31.589
Join my legion of the undead.

41:31.589 --> 41:33.221
Not interested.

41:37.900 --> 41:42.387
Then I thank you for keeping my legacy alive
in my absence.

41:42.387 --> 41:47.743
But now there is only room
for one Batman in Gotham.

42:06.800 --> 42:10.130
You spurned my offer of eternal life.

42:10.130 --> 42:13.030
The next time, we do not part

42:13.030 --> 42:17.218
until maggots feed upon your flesh.

42:29.000 --> 42:30.737
Al-fred...

42:33.700 --> 42:34.641
Oh dear.

43:39.155 --> 43:40.888
You!

43:55.400 --> 43:57.510
Only a dream, Master Bruce.

43:58.730 --> 44:00.982
Wish I could say the same about last night.

44:01.200 --> 44:04.165
Dracula's stronger than the Batman in every way.

44:04.400 --> 44:05.836
Physically, mentally.

44:06.300 --> 44:09.000
I'm even being swallowed up by his legend.

44:09.000 --> 44:09.732
Sir?

44:11.800 --> 44:14.362
The more the Batman tries to protect Gotham,

44:14.662 --> 44:16.862
the more Gotham fears him.

44:17.362 --> 44:20.699
As if he were the son of Dracula.

44:26.300 --> 44:27.800
Mustn't wake Master too early,

44:27.800 --> 44:29.491
doesn't like the sun in his eyes.

44:29.541 --> 44:33.218
Mustn't be late, he'll be hungry and cranky.

44:38.500 --> 44:41.500
Hmm. Almost dark.

44:46.000 --> 44:47.300
Huh, what?

44:47.300 --> 44:48.311
You!

44:49.700 --> 44:52.800
Everyone's so shocked to see me these days.

44:52.800 --> 44:56.113
You, the fisherman who found me tangled in his net.

44:56.113 --> 45:00.925
By the way, who knew electroshock therapy
could be so invigorating?

45:01.125 --> 45:02.862
But that's all water under the bridge,

45:03.062 --> 45:06.067
cause Joker's back from the grave.

45:06.736 --> 45:08.828
Yeah, a lot of that going around.

45:09.324 --> 45:11.317
Speaking of graves, Penggy,

45:11.617 --> 45:14.137
might you be hiding buried treasure?

45:14.137 --> 45:16.533
No! There's nothing in there!

45:18.000 --> 45:20.656
Thought we were partners!

45:26.100 --> 45:28.689
Some hideout you got here, Penggy!

45:29.000 --> 45:31.300
Dripping with atmosphere.

45:31.700 --> 45:33.354
I'm warning you Joker!

45:33.554 --> 45:36.000
There's nothing here for you!

45:55.200 --> 45:59.365
Ooooh, that is one fat looking vault.

46:00.800 --> 46:02.074
No, Joker!

46:02.474 --> 46:05.850
That's one good looking corpse.

46:15.300 --> 46:18.801
Breakfast in bed, fresh squeezed.

46:41.800 --> 46:44.596
You, want to give blood?

46:51.800 --> 46:53.541
A break-in at the bank.

46:53.541 --> 46:56.800
As you have more apocalyptic matters to attend to,

46:56.800 --> 46:59.665
might you be leaving this one to the police?

46:59.665 --> 47:02.079
It's a blood bank.

47:18.700 --> 47:23.137
A bold finish of wild cherries, with a hint of oak.

48:14.600 --> 48:15.908
Joker?

48:16.008 --> 48:18.410
Undead and kicking!

48:20.100 --> 48:24.300
Funny, you're my second Batman tonight!

48:24.300 --> 48:27.371
And you're both pains in the neck!

48:37.100 --> 48:41.300
Batman, you're one dead duck!

48:47.534 --> 48:48.695
Garlic.

48:48.695 --> 48:50.500
Eww.

49:59.552 --> 50:00.700
Sir?

50:00.700 --> 50:02.741
Your garlic bombs did the trick.

50:03.300 --> 50:05.578
We have our test subject.

50:30.412 --> 50:31.796
Anything, Sir?

50:31.800 --> 50:33.017
Joker's not talking.

50:33.017 --> 50:35.401
He won't reveal Dracula's resting place,

50:35.501 --> 50:38.944
not so long as he has vampire blood in his veins.

50:38.944 --> 50:41.300
Batsy!!

50:41.300 --> 50:44.700
Joker has suffered a fate crueler than death.

50:45.600 --> 50:48.736
I intend to bring him back to the land of the living.

50:48.736 --> 50:50.947
With a little blood work.

51:49.400 --> 51:52.900
Hey little girl. You shouldn't be out here.

52:19.400 --> 52:22.900
Solar generator prepped and ready, Sir.

52:53.750 --> 52:57.250
Joker's blood didn't withstand the sunlight.

53:28.029 --> 53:29.700
I know you're near, Batsy.

53:29.700 --> 53:34.502
I can smell the precious nectar pumping
through your veins.

53:42.100 --> 53:43.600
Find anything of value?

53:43.700 --> 53:46.900
To be quite honest, so much vampire lore exists,

53:46.900 --> 53:50.253
that it is difficult to separate fact from fiction.

53:51.500 --> 53:56.200
Carmilla Karnstein, the bride of Count Dracula.

53:56.200 --> 54:00.052
According to legend,
her bloodthirst rivalled even his own.

54:00.700 --> 54:01.800
It seems they were-

54:01.800 --> 54:03.600
Meant for each other?

54:03.900 --> 54:07.000
If Cupid's arrow could penetrate a heart so black,

54:07.500 --> 54:10.600
there may be hope for you yet, Master Bruce.

54:12.800 --> 54:14.214
Miss Vale.

54:14.810 --> 54:16.170
It's Saturday night.

54:16.200 --> 54:17.376
The dinner!

54:17.376 --> 54:21.100
I completely forgot with all of this
blood sucking nastiness about.

54:23.300 --> 54:27.773
The horror! The horror!

54:29.000 --> 54:31.106
Tell her I'm running late.

54:35.900 --> 54:37.367
Coming!

54:46.705 --> 54:50.337
Miss Vale. Please, do come in.

54:54.000 --> 54:56.839
Why do you torment me, Batsy?

54:57.200 --> 54:59.322
I thought you cared.

54:59.600 --> 55:02.750
Trust me Joker, I'm trying to help you.

55:02.750 --> 55:05.456
Then feed me!

55:12.800 --> 55:14.500
Got ketchup?

55:17.600 --> 55:20.300
The grief must continue to affect Bruce.

55:20.400 --> 55:23.900
I mean, no one ever really gets over
a trauma like that.

55:24.000 --> 55:27.067
Master Bruce has his outlets.

55:27.400 --> 55:29.980
He must fear losing those he cares about.

55:30.400 --> 55:36.172
Which would explain his difficulty
in letting people get close.

55:37.500 --> 55:40.653
You have been most patient, Miss Vale.

55:45.000 --> 55:47.200
Do I smell garlic?

55:47.200 --> 55:49.446
Uh, that would be dinner.

55:56.400 --> 55:59.207
He isn't coming, is he?

56:14.700 --> 56:19.144
Thirsty. Burning up inside.

56:20.500 --> 56:23.900
I can't take it anymore!

56:28.308 --> 56:31.705
Have mercy on a sad clown.

56:40.000 --> 56:43.210
Dracula's resting place, where is it?

56:43.300 --> 56:44.800
Don't you see?

56:44.800 --> 56:47.515
The choice isn't mine to make.

56:48.400 --> 56:51.687
I am his vessel.

57:03.100 --> 57:07.730
Batsy, you complete me.

57:44.400 --> 57:46.402
Stable.

57:49.388 --> 57:50.826
Vicki.

57:51.400 --> 57:55.157
Astonishingly, she still speaks the world of you.

58:07.933 --> 58:09.424
Lunch.

58:11.200 --> 58:13.300
It's about time, Batsy.

58:13.300 --> 58:14.985
You're late!

58:19.700 --> 58:21.623
Taste's a little off.

58:21.700 --> 58:23.924
You sure this is fresh?

58:44.300 --> 58:45.700
No games, Joker.

58:45.700 --> 58:47.414
Where's Dracula?

58:47.800 --> 58:49.148
I'm looking at him.

58:49.243 --> 58:51.100
Where's Penguin?
Penguin?

58:51.100 --> 58:54.628
Where's Gotham Cemetary?
Cemetary.

58:54.628 --> 58:56.417
Am I.. am I dreaming?

58:56.417 --> 58:59.202
No, just insane.

58:59.502 --> 59:02.654
Which is why you're going back to Arkham.

59:05.900 --> 59:07.639
The cure had an interesting side effect.

59:08.192 --> 59:11.500
It seems when vampirism leaves one's system,

59:11.800 --> 59:14.335
so does the victim's memory of it.

59:14.600 --> 59:16.211
Perhaps for the better, Sir.

59:16.316 --> 59:19.698
After all, Gotham can barely
accept the legend of the Batman.

59:19.909 --> 59:22.990
However will they deal with the truth about Dracula?

59:23.075 --> 59:26.197
Hopefully that won't be an issue after tonight.

59:28.600 --> 59:30.789
Dracula's holed up in Gotham Cemetary,

59:31.000 --> 59:33.203
where I intend to bury him.

59:33.319 --> 59:34.650
Permanently.

59:35.036 --> 59:36.306
Begging pardon, Sir.

59:36.401 --> 59:39.928
You think your magic bullet may actually
destroy Dracula?

59:40.700 --> 59:42.888
Dracula may walk like a man,

59:43.200 --> 59:45.196
but he's a monster.

59:47.100 --> 59:50.755
Wait, wait up! Wait!

01:00:07.700 --> 01:00:09.800
Miss Vale.

01:00:10.600 --> 01:00:12.000
Doctor Alucard.

01:00:12.100 --> 01:00:15.400
Now you of all people should know better, Miss Vale.

01:00:15.700 --> 01:00:17.200
Alone at night?

01:00:17.200 --> 01:00:18.900
Yeah I know. The lost ones.

01:00:19.100 --> 01:00:20.910
I wasn't planning on missing my train.

01:00:21.200 --> 01:00:24.300
It may be some time before the next one arrives.

01:00:24.600 --> 01:00:28.296
Would you like to join me? For a drink?

01:00:28.500 --> 01:00:31.141
Uh, thank you, but I'm running late.

01:00:31.237 --> 01:00:33.510
So I'll catch a cab.

01:00:33.650 --> 01:00:35.239
Have a good night, Doctor.

01:00:56.200 --> 01:00:57.600
Sorry Vicki.

01:00:57.600 --> 01:01:00.760
Tonight, I have a date with Dracula.

01:01:01.400 --> 01:01:06.599
You have reached Wayne Mansion.
Please leave a message at the tone.

01:01:18.816 --> 01:01:22.338
Master Bruce, I know you are eager
to put an end to this reign of terror,

01:01:22.700 --> 01:01:25.790
but would it not be more prudent
to wait until sunrise?

01:01:26.100 --> 01:01:28.800
If you cannot guarantee your victory, Sir-

01:01:29.500 --> 01:01:31.022
Gotham loses.

01:01:32.057 --> 01:01:33.700
I'll need every advantage.

01:01:33.700 --> 01:01:37.600
And for once it is a big morning that
the Batman has ahead of him.

01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:39.086
Do get some rest.

01:01:39.700 --> 01:01:42.271
After returning Vicki's call.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:54.688
She's not picking up.

01:01:54.708 --> 01:01:55.991
Sir?

01:02:03.500 --> 01:02:04.981
Vicki.

01:02:07.500 --> 01:02:09.200
Hi Bruce. It's Vicki.

01:02:09.200 --> 01:02:11.474
You won't believe who I just bumped into.

01:02:11.600 --> 01:02:14.400
Tall dark and weird? Oh, well.

01:02:14.400 --> 01:02:17.700
I was hoping you might be around to rescue me-

01:02:17.950 --> 01:02:20.800
Sir, it is many hours before daybreak.

01:02:20.800 --> 01:02:23.615
I think Vicki's been patient enough.

01:02:24.252 --> 01:02:25.713
Right then.

01:03:02.200 --> 01:03:06.100
My children of the night.
Gather witness.

01:03:06.400 --> 01:03:08.582
The blood wedding.

01:03:15.200 --> 01:03:17.900
Vicki Vampira Vale.

01:03:17.900 --> 01:03:20.700
So what do we call her? Mrs Dracula?

01:03:20.700 --> 01:03:22.812
You misunderstand, Penguin.

01:03:22.812 --> 01:03:27.000
Miss Vale lacks the bite I require in a mate.

01:03:27.300 --> 01:03:30.755
Meet my true bride.

01:03:39.499 --> 01:03:41.960
But she's-
Ashes?

01:03:42.600 --> 01:03:46.707
Carmilla suffered the fate of immolation by sunlight.

01:03:46.900 --> 01:03:49.597
An almost permanent death.

01:03:49.800 --> 01:03:55.033
Mere blood cannot repair her,
as it would have punctured her heart.

01:04:03.700 --> 01:04:05.600
To resurrect my bride,

01:04:05.600 --> 01:04:09.805
she must feed upon the very essence of life itself.

01:04:10.500 --> 01:04:14.425
Master, take my soul.

01:04:24.841 --> 01:04:26.398
Joker's footprints.

01:04:41.200 --> 01:04:44.600
So this is how Dracula bypassed the crosses.

01:04:45.300 --> 01:04:48.800
I once tapped into these long forgotten catacombs.

01:04:49.500 --> 01:04:52.117
Apparently so did he.

01:05:21.500 --> 01:05:24.249
An unwanted guest.

01:07:43.700 --> 01:07:46.200
The... lost ones?

01:07:46.200 --> 01:07:47.450
Where are we?

01:07:47.500 --> 01:07:50.484
I don't know,
but let's get everyone out of here.

01:08:15.200 --> 01:08:18.872
You dare interrupt the ceremony.

01:08:34.600 --> 01:08:40.537
You cannot win.
No human can resist my will.

01:08:48.406 --> 01:08:49.950
Good boy.

01:08:49.950 --> 01:08:52.700
Once my bride has had her fill,

01:08:53.200 --> 01:08:58.942
I shall offer up your corpse as a wedding gift.

01:09:50.700 --> 01:09:52.142
My bride!

01:10:05.600 --> 01:10:07.299
Batman?

01:10:10.200 --> 01:10:16.024
If my bride cannot have your soul, Vicki Vale,
I shall have your blood!

01:10:16.115 --> 01:10:17.711
Run!

01:10:29.500 --> 01:10:30.812
Go!

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:42.312
Maybe you didn't hear,
Master's not through with you!

01:10:46.200 --> 01:10:48.792
It's scarcely midnight, Batman.

01:10:49.900 --> 01:10:53.536
Sunrise will not help you this time.

01:11:34.021 --> 01:11:40.350
No need to see you, Batman, I can smell your blood.

01:11:47.800 --> 01:11:54.542
Master Bruce is triangulating his location,
from within the catacombs?

01:12:43.450 --> 01:12:44.941
Come here!

01:13:43.698 --> 01:13:46.979
I do hope this is a positive turn.

01:14:42.100 --> 01:14:43.947
Count Dracula!

01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:01.787
I will drain you dry,
and use your cape as a dinner napkin.

01:15:02.200 --> 01:15:03.972
Oh dear.

01:15:18.900 --> 01:15:23.932
Now where did you disappear to, my pretty?

01:15:26.500 --> 01:15:28.880
Knock knock.

01:15:31.500 --> 01:15:34.320
Here's Ozzy!

01:16:04.800 --> 01:16:09.578
Impressive dwelling.
It shall be your tomb.

01:16:13.300 --> 01:16:15.248
Bite this!

01:16:34.900 --> 01:16:39.100
You may have cured
my human victims of their disease,

01:16:39.100 --> 01:16:44.883
but no earthly medicine can cure
a supernatural affliction.

01:16:55.700 --> 01:16:58.078
Go on, run.

01:16:58.100 --> 01:17:09.000
I am beyond human, Batman.
I am evil incarnate. I am the prince of-

01:17:11.700 --> 01:17:13.526
Darkness?

01:17:13.600 --> 01:17:15.700
Rise and shine.

01:17:30.538 --> 01:17:34.109
You are... Bruce Wayne.

01:17:38.200 --> 01:17:40.509
I'm the Batman.

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.323
And you're dust.

01:18:02.300 --> 01:18:06.264
I shall sweep that into the dustbin, straightaway.

01:18:11.600 --> 01:18:18.700
Soon Master will... drink your uh, blood and stuff-

01:18:18.800 --> 01:18:22.905
What am I talking about? Huh?

01:18:25.020 --> 01:18:27.320
Treasure!

01:18:27.755 --> 01:18:30.324
That's what I'm talking about!

01:18:30.664 --> 01:18:32.724
Freeze!

01:18:40.800 --> 01:18:43.714
Tonight, Gotham breathes a sigh of relief.

01:18:43.800 --> 01:18:46.120
The lost ones have been found.

01:18:46.120 --> 01:18:49.000
It seems Penguin was behind the bizarre plot

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:52.748
to use the hostages to recover
a missing mob treasure.

01:18:52.748 --> 01:18:56.700
Though details remain sketchy due to
amnesia inflicted on the hostages,

01:18:56.700 --> 01:18:59.340
apparently via some sort of hypnosis.

01:18:59.340 --> 01:19:01.614
But the hostages are safe and sound.

01:19:01.614 --> 01:19:06.039
And it now seems that the Batman was
unfairly blamed for Penguin's crimes.

01:19:06.039 --> 01:19:11.200
So it is safe to say we can swap
his status from villain back to vigilante.

01:19:11.200 --> 01:19:15.400
It was vampires I tell you, vampires!

01:19:15.400 --> 01:19:18.473
With big honking fangs.

01:19:20.220 --> 01:19:23.968
Good thing they've kept Penguin's pet
at Nest Warm back at Arkham Asylum.

01:19:24.436 --> 01:19:25.967
Now here's a twist.

01:19:25.967 --> 01:19:30.230
Instead of covering the news,
reporter Vicki Vale has become it.

01:19:30.265 --> 01:19:32.317
See any vampires, Vicki?

01:19:34.455 --> 01:19:36.455
Just bats.
