01:10.335 --> 01:11.455
<i>Sonja.</i>

01:25.494 --> 01:27.654
<i>You are suffering, Sonja...</i>

01:29.134 --> 01:32.334
<i>but vengeance shall be yours.</i>

01:32.654 --> 01:35.014
<i>Vengeance on Queen Gedren...</i>

01:36.134 --> 01:38.134
<i>who wanted you for herself.</i>

01:40.254 --> 01:42.573
<i>Your disgust was clear.</i>

01:46.573 --> 01:51.013
<i>And so it was that Gedren</i>
<i>ordered your family murdered...</i>

01:53.373 --> 01:56.653
<i>your body violated by her soldiers.</i>

01:59.053 --> 02:02.573
<i>But in your quest</i>
<i>for justice and vengeance...</i>

02:03.812 --> 02:06.012
<i>you will need great strength...</i>

02:07.532 --> 02:11.132
<i>for your sword arm must have no equal.</i>

02:12.892 --> 02:15.572
<i>I give you that strength.</i>

05:00.644 --> 05:03.884
Varna, where is the Lord of Hyrkania?

05:04.404 --> 05:06.324
He has not come, Highness.

05:06.564 --> 05:09.564
He should be here
for the destruction of the talisman.

05:10.684 --> 05:14.523
But we cannot delay.
We will proceed without him.

05:39.202 --> 05:41.722
O God of the high Gods...

05:42.322 --> 05:46.762
behold the talisman with which
you created the world and all things.

05:54.561 --> 05:56.121
O God of Gods...

05:56.921 --> 05:59.441
it has become too powerful for us...

06:00.161 --> 06:03.801
and we must destroy it
before it destroys the world.

06:20.600 --> 06:23.960
Forgive us now
as we send it out of the light...

06:24.040 --> 06:26.280
from which it draws its power...

06:27.160 --> 06:29.520
into eternal darkness.

06:42.239 --> 06:43.519
Forgive us.

08:48.633 --> 08:49.833
Come on.

09:10.872 --> 09:12.832
So this can make worlds...

09:14.312 --> 09:17.032
or shatter them by storm and earthquake.

09:19.672 --> 09:21.312
Have it lifted out.

09:21.392 --> 09:22.711
Lift it out!

09:54.030 --> 09:55.230
Touch it.

10:50.307 --> 10:53.387
So it is true. Only women may touch it.

10:55.747 --> 10:57.027
The cover.

11:06.307 --> 11:07.626
Take it out.

11:18.786 --> 11:22.026
Great queen,
what shall we do with the prisoners?

11:32.545 --> 11:34.385
- No!
- No!

11:59.984 --> 12:01.024
Come.

12:23.463 --> 12:24.583
Horses.

14:23.417 --> 14:25.217
The talisman's stolen.

14:26.777 --> 14:28.937
Must destroy the talisman.

14:31.057 --> 14:33.977
We must find my sister. Take me.

14:34.657 --> 14:38.176
I know where she is. Please.

15:11.855 --> 15:13.175
Magnificent.

15:21.654 --> 15:24.454
You have nothing more to learn, Sonja.

15:27.014 --> 15:30.814
You are the master of the master.

15:31.974 --> 15:34.054
Never have l seen your equal.

15:47.933 --> 15:51.333
You must learn to like men a little better.

15:52.373 --> 15:54.173
They are not all evil.

15:54.813 --> 15:57.853
We must judge by our own experience,
Grand Master.

15:57.893 --> 15:59.013
I know.

16:00.133 --> 16:03.772
But in life, all is not swordplay.

16:04.972 --> 16:08.572
Hatred of men in a lovely young woman...

16:09.892 --> 16:11.812
it could be your downfall.

16:13.532 --> 16:15.892
I don't hate all men, Grand Master.

16:16.892 --> 16:20.532
That would have been music to my ears
30 years ago.

16:21.251 --> 16:22.331
Come.

16:23.171 --> 16:27.251
A great swordsman
must have a great sword.

16:40.651 --> 16:41.811
Choose.

16:42.410 --> 16:44.850
A gift from the Grand Master.

16:56.450 --> 16:57.530
<i>Sonja.</i>

16:59.970 --> 17:01.730
What is it, Red Sonja?

17:29.728 --> 17:31.648
I'm looking for Red Sonja.

17:45.527 --> 17:48.207
- I am Sonja.
- Your sister's dying.

17:50.887 --> 17:52.567
I'll take you to her.

18:45.805 --> 18:46.885
Varna.

18:54.324 --> 18:55.604
Thank God.

18:56.444 --> 18:58.244
I've lived long enough.

19:00.004 --> 19:01.804
The talisman's stolen.

19:02.724 --> 19:05.284
All the priests massacred.

19:06.364 --> 19:09.363
- We fought...
- Rest, Varna. Later we can talk.

19:09.883 --> 19:12.083
There's no time. Listen.

19:14.323 --> 19:16.963
The talisman has terrible power...

19:18.163 --> 19:20.083
which grows in the light.

19:22.683 --> 19:26.723
In 13 days it could destroy the world...

19:27.643 --> 19:31.482
by storm and earthquake.

19:38.802 --> 19:41.282
You must destroy the talisman, Sonja.

19:42.082 --> 19:46.162
Send it into darkness. Swear that you will.

19:46.602 --> 19:47.762
I swear.

19:48.962 --> 19:50.322
Who took it?

19:51.161 --> 19:52.561
I don't know.

19:54.441 --> 19:57.361
There was a woman with a gold mask.

19:58.321 --> 19:59.521
Soldiers.

19:59.761 --> 20:02.481
Where did they take it? North? South?

20:13.080 --> 20:16.560
She's dead.
And the living have work to do.

20:20.200 --> 20:23.920
Her work, my work, is no concern of yours.

20:26.120 --> 20:28.800
- Who are you, anyway?
- My name is Kalidor.

20:29.560 --> 20:31.960
I befriended your sister, remember?

20:32.439 --> 20:34.159
I'm a friend of yours, too.

20:34.239 --> 20:37.999
I thank you for what you did for my sister.
You will be rewarded.

20:38.199 --> 20:40.799
I'm no mercenary. Nobody pays me.

20:41.399 --> 20:44.439
If l think somebody owes me something,
l take it.

21:26.517 --> 21:28.837
Someone is using the talisman.

21:30.677 --> 21:34.637
- What place is that?
- Hablok. It's a great city.

21:40.036 --> 21:41.716
Where are you going?

21:42.836 --> 21:43.956
Hablok.

21:45.596 --> 21:47.556
Wait. I'll come with you.

21:47.996 --> 21:51.316
Why should you? It's no business of yours.

21:51.636 --> 21:53.196
And neither am I.

21:53.276 --> 21:55.516
You may be wrong on both counts.

21:55.796 --> 21:59.075
I know you're a brave girl,
but danger is my trade.

21:59.795 --> 22:02.315
Then l'll learn it by myself.

22:06.235 --> 22:08.355
Don't make me angry, Kalidor.

22:09.035 --> 22:11.075
I don't need any man's help.

22:31.114 --> 22:35.074
Don't shake it, fool. Hold it steady!
Can you do nothing right?

22:35.514 --> 22:37.354
Still, you great idiot.

22:38.193 --> 22:40.113
I'm trying, Your Highness.

22:41.313 --> 22:45.073
Clumsy oaf. Stupid, dumb,
useless, selfish beast!

22:45.273 --> 22:47.193
Quickly, come. Come to me.

22:47.393 --> 22:51.033
Don't give me orders, slave.
I'll have you hung by the heels.

22:51.273 --> 22:53.273
Anyway, it's too slippery.

22:53.553 --> 22:57.313
Do you want me to fall
in that boiling mud? You numskull.

22:57.993 --> 23:00.592
I'll try to swing it around. Now.

23:00.952 --> 23:03.272
- Hold still, boy.
- Boy?

23:07.432 --> 23:10.192
Steady, Your Majesty. Steady.

23:28.951 --> 23:30.431
Jump off. Jump.

23:32.591 --> 23:34.271
What about me?

23:34.351 --> 23:36.951
Get back here and stop playing the fool.

23:37.951 --> 23:40.990
I hear and obey, master of the world.
I'm coming.

24:08.869 --> 24:11.949
Lucky for you that this person came along.

24:12.669 --> 24:15.109
Reward her, and tell her who l am.

24:17.149 --> 24:20.989
His Royal Highness, the Prince Tarn,
Great Lord of Hablok...

24:22.029 --> 24:24.228
keeper of the spotless throne...

24:24.308 --> 24:26.748
great elephant who fertilizes the world
with his...

24:26.828 --> 24:28.948
l've told you not to say that.

24:29.228 --> 24:31.788
Do it again, and l'll have you impaled.

24:33.948 --> 24:36.068
Well, reward her, fool.

24:46.987 --> 24:50.627
From the look of your kingdom, Prince,
you need this more than l do.

24:54.307 --> 24:55.947
Did she address me?

24:57.467 --> 24:58.907
What happened?

24:59.147 --> 25:01.747
Queen Gedren attacked us
is what happened.

25:01.827 --> 25:04.626
Gedren? Queen Gedren?

25:05.026 --> 25:06.426
That's right.

25:07.146 --> 25:11.426
She knocked down half the city with her
new weapon and demanded our surrender.

25:11.466 --> 25:13.026
My army ran away.

25:13.706 --> 25:15.746
Do they want to live forever?

25:15.826 --> 25:17.866
I refused to surrender.

25:18.426 --> 25:20.826
So she knocked down the other half.

25:21.546 --> 25:25.026
Falkon, since everyone is dead
or run away...

25:25.426 --> 25:27.945
you shall escort me
to the mountains tomorrow.

25:28.025 --> 25:29.865
I shall raise a new army...

25:29.945 --> 25:33.185
and crush this upstart Gedren underfoot.

25:33.865 --> 25:36.505
Where can l find her, this Queen Gedren?

25:36.745 --> 25:39.345
In Burkubane, the land of eternal night.

25:39.425 --> 25:40.705
How do l get there?

25:40.745 --> 25:44.625
There's a long scenic way, and there's
the short way through Brytag's toll road.

25:44.705 --> 25:47.664
I'll take Brytag's toll road.
Which way is that?

25:48.744 --> 25:51.544
Straight north from here.
You can't miss it.

25:52.584 --> 25:54.304
But it's worth a try.

25:56.264 --> 25:59.024
Ask the woman
if she wishes to join my army.

25:59.584 --> 26:01.584
We'll probably need a cook.

26:01.704 --> 26:04.704
Your Highness is too kind,
but l travel alone.

26:06.024 --> 26:09.703
Dismiss the woman, Falkon.
I shall dine in an hour.

26:15.623 --> 26:17.823
May l give you a word of advice?

26:17.943 --> 26:21.223
Put him over your knee
and beat some manners into him.

26:23.223 --> 26:25.703
You wouldn't happen to have a tablecloth,
would you?

27:17.420 --> 27:19.860
Brytag, come down and open the gate.

27:20.260 --> 27:21.980
Not so fast, redhead.

27:22.980 --> 27:25.700
I'm up here
where l can get a better look at you.

27:25.780 --> 27:28.020
I have no time to waste, Brytag.

27:28.660 --> 27:31.419
I have plenty. Come up, l say.

28:16.817 --> 28:19.057
- Come here, wench.
- Why should I?

28:22.537 --> 28:25.657
Because l am Brytag. This is my land.

28:26.697 --> 28:29.177
All that pass through pay me tribute.

28:29.217 --> 28:31.817
- How much, Brytag?
- Who mentioned money?

28:32.697 --> 28:34.216
Tribute, l said.

28:34.856 --> 28:37.296
The tender kind all women pay to Brytag.

28:46.736 --> 28:48.216
Suppose l don't.

28:48.576 --> 28:52.296
Suppose, instead, l open up
that great fat belly of yours.

28:56.575 --> 28:57.975
You hear that?

28:58.415 --> 29:00.775
She's going to open up my great...

29:03.055 --> 29:06.495
Woman, l have fought 177 men.

29:06.775 --> 29:09.615
Only one survives, and he has got no legs.

29:10.015 --> 29:12.175
You dare to mock at Brytag?

29:13.015 --> 29:14.735
That takes no daring.

29:18.254 --> 29:22.054
But when l've killed you,
will your warriors let me go unharmed?

29:22.454 --> 29:24.534
When you've killed me?

29:26.614 --> 29:30.894
When this wench has killed me,
you will let her go unharmed, won't you?

29:31.334 --> 29:32.374
Aye.

29:37.893 --> 29:38.933
See?

29:42.413 --> 29:43.693
So, wench.

29:47.933 --> 29:50.853
I'm gonna feed your eyes
to the birds, red hair.

29:51.093 --> 29:52.893
I don't need eyes to find you.

29:52.973 --> 29:55.373
I can smell you at a hundred paces.

30:43.450 --> 30:46.450
I will tell the future in your entrails,
red woman.

30:46.810 --> 30:49.530
I know my future. You have none.

31:37.848 --> 31:39.248
Hold on, Sonja.

31:47.767 --> 31:49.247
Sonja, come on.

32:06.926 --> 32:08.126
Look out!

32:28.725 --> 32:30.445
This way. Follow me!

32:31.325 --> 32:33.605
- Get away. Go!
- What about you?

32:33.685 --> 32:35.365
I can hold them. Go!

32:37.925 --> 32:39.685
Hurry! Stop them!

33:14.003 --> 33:15.723
Release me, ruffian!

33:15.923 --> 33:17.523
Release me, l say!

33:19.003 --> 33:21.563
- Tell us where it is.
- I'll have your head for this!

33:21.643 --> 33:23.043
Don't be shy.

33:25.443 --> 33:27.682
The gold, boy. Where's the gold?

33:28.362 --> 33:30.282
There is no gold, ruffian.

33:35.482 --> 33:38.002
I tell you, l have no gold!

33:39.202 --> 33:43.402
You have fine raiment, boy,
almost as resplendent as mine.

33:44.402 --> 33:46.642
And you expect me to believe
you're penniless?

33:46.722 --> 33:50.761
I'll have you know, villain,
l am Prince Tarn of Hablok.

33:51.121 --> 33:54.481
My subjects will see
to your punishment for this.

33:55.041 --> 33:58.961
And a grievous punishment it will be,
impertinent oaf!

33:59.201 --> 34:00.641
Your subjects?

34:01.001 --> 34:03.161
My kingdom is greater than yours.

34:03.241 --> 34:05.121
And l have but four.

34:08.161 --> 34:09.360
Pull him!

35:13.517 --> 35:16.917
- Are you all right, your sovereign Majesty?
- Yes, clumsy oaf.

35:17.877 --> 35:19.677
Why did you leave him?

35:20.157 --> 35:22.037
We needed food. I went hunting.

35:22.117 --> 35:24.157
You could have taken him with you.

35:24.237 --> 35:27.117
Tell her, Falkon,
that l don't care for hunting.

35:29.117 --> 35:31.157
He doesn't care for hunting.

35:59.675 --> 36:03.195
Treasure to the vaults,
prisoners to the dungeons.

36:03.995 --> 36:06.755
Take the talisman back
to the Chamber of Lights.

36:06.795 --> 36:08.515
Very well, my queen.

37:35.271 --> 37:38.670
Perhaps fewer candles...

37:38.990 --> 37:41.230
would be advisable, Your Majesty.

37:41.710 --> 37:42.710
Why?

37:42.950 --> 37:46.230
The stronger the light, the greater
the power of the talisman grows.

37:46.310 --> 37:48.310
I want more light here, not less.

37:48.390 --> 37:51.910
But it is dangerously powerful already,
great queen.

37:51.990 --> 37:56.190
- Look what it did to Hablok.
- Yes. Very satisfying.

37:57.310 --> 38:00.669
But l want its full power
when we march against Toktyl, Ikol.

38:00.749 --> 38:02.109
Its full power.

38:02.189 --> 38:05.309
- It will be beyond our control, Majesty.
- Majesty!

38:05.349 --> 38:07.989
Enemies are approaching
the outer empire.

39:42.625 --> 39:45.504
It's the Prince of Hablok, Your Majesty...

39:45.584 --> 39:47.424
with his army.

39:47.584 --> 39:48.744
Insects.

39:53.224 --> 39:54.464
That girl.

39:56.944 --> 40:00.184
So she escaped the fire. How fortunate.

40:01.424 --> 40:05.783
Ikol, l want her alive
without so much as a scratch on her skin.

40:06.423 --> 40:08.943
Shall l send out a small ambush party?

40:11.223 --> 40:12.183
No.

40:13.183 --> 40:15.863
We'll wait till they get a little closer.

40:31.622 --> 40:35.582
Burkubane, the land of perpetual night.

40:35.742 --> 40:38.582
Falkon, proclaim my arrival...

40:38.742 --> 40:41.142
and the defiance of Queen Gedren.

40:41.502 --> 40:43.142
Sound your trumpet.

40:43.662 --> 40:45.302
Keep quiet...

40:45.862 --> 40:48.341
at least till we find a way across.

40:48.421 --> 40:52.221
Princes do not sneak in
on their enemies like thieves.

40:52.821 --> 40:55.501
You don't know
much about princes, do you?

41:23.340 --> 41:25.460
You wait here with the horses.

41:26.780 --> 41:29.539
I want to test this bridge first.

41:30.099 --> 41:31.699
Or whatever it is.

42:09.338 --> 42:12.457
It looks safe enough.
We'll lead the horses across.

42:15.417 --> 42:17.377
Now hear me, Gedren!

42:17.457 --> 42:20.017
It is I, Prince Tarn of Hablok...

42:20.097 --> 42:23.577
to revenge myself
on the tyrant of Burkubane.

42:24.137 --> 42:27.457
Be quiet, you arrogant, ungrateful pup.

42:28.217 --> 42:29.937
How dare you, woman?

42:30.017 --> 42:31.856
I'll show you how l dare.

42:31.936 --> 42:34.376
This should have been done long ago.

42:34.696 --> 42:37.936
No. If you must hit someone, then hit me.

42:40.896 --> 42:42.976
You're not worth the effort, boy.

42:43.056 --> 42:45.056
Boy?

42:45.136 --> 42:47.816
Yes, boy. You'll never be anything else...

42:47.896 --> 42:51.336
till you learn gratitude
and self-sacrifice, like Falkon.

42:51.536 --> 42:53.095
He's a real man.

43:00.255 --> 43:04.295
She didn't mean it, my prince.
She doesn't know your fine qualities.

43:21.414 --> 43:23.054
Take that, ruffian.

43:36.493 --> 43:38.293
Take that, you ruffian.

43:52.853 --> 43:54.613
Practicing, Highness?

43:54.933 --> 43:58.372
I thought princes did everything so well,
they wouldn't need to.

43:58.852 --> 44:01.452
I was disarmed by those ruffians
the other day.

44:01.532 --> 44:04.532
I noticed. So? It needn't be fatal.

44:04.972 --> 44:07.172
I am disarmed. Kill me. Come on.

44:08.052 --> 44:09.252
Come on!

44:17.491 --> 44:20.171
You're meant to be
using your sword. Remember?

44:27.491 --> 44:29.091
Simple, isn't it?

44:29.531 --> 44:31.691
But it's not in the rule book.

44:31.731 --> 44:34.891
You see, fencing and fighting
are two different things.

44:35.371 --> 44:37.450
You need to learn them both.

44:48.410 --> 44:52.290
Will you teach me to fence and to fight?

44:53.810 --> 44:55.290
If you please?

44:59.889 --> 45:01.569
Spoken like a prince.

45:05.809 --> 45:09.289
You were disarmed
because you hold the hilt too tight.

45:09.529 --> 45:11.409
Grip gently. See?

45:15.089 --> 45:17.329
Gently. I see. Like this?

45:18.929 --> 45:20.888
Your Highness learns fast.

45:21.768 --> 45:25.168
I think we'll continue
your fencing lessons another time.

45:26.488 --> 45:28.208
We've an early start.

45:28.728 --> 45:30.448
You are very beautiful.

45:30.528 --> 45:33.928
When l am king of Hablok,
l shall have you at my court.

45:34.808 --> 45:37.048
You will? My, the honor.

45:38.408 --> 45:40.527
I may even make you my queen.

45:40.967 --> 45:43.007
But l'm still young.

45:43.487 --> 45:45.247
We shall have to see.

46:16.686 --> 46:19.686
They will reach
the Ithian Cavern tomorrow.

46:19.766 --> 46:22.445
We must force them to take shelter there.

46:23.165 --> 46:25.685
The killing machine will do the rest.

46:25.765 --> 46:28.085
Yes. They'll make fine fish food.

46:29.645 --> 46:31.205
But not the girl.

46:31.565 --> 46:35.045
I want that beauty here with me.
See to it that she is spared.

46:36.405 --> 46:39.165
I'll do my best, my queen.

46:39.685 --> 46:42.565
The machine is difficult to control.

46:42.645 --> 46:46.004
One cannot guarantee
that something will not go wrong.

46:47.724 --> 46:50.884
If it does, you will be its next victim.

47:02.644 --> 47:06.363
The talisman, Ikol. We need a storm.

47:07.843 --> 47:09.163
A little one.

47:20.723 --> 47:22.563
We should be out in the storm.

47:23.563 --> 47:25.482
Why? This is shelter, isn't it?

47:25.562 --> 47:29.562
I haven't got time to shelter.
I've four days left to find the talisman.

47:31.882 --> 47:34.402
Besides, something drove us in here...

47:34.762 --> 47:36.482
every bit of the way.

47:37.762 --> 47:40.282
I noticed it, but l'm not complaining.

47:43.482 --> 47:44.842
Where's Tarn?

47:46.321 --> 47:49.441
He promised not to wander.
Dry off, l'll go find him.

47:55.401 --> 47:56.801
Look at this.

48:03.281 --> 48:05.681
It must be the biggest in the world.

48:10.920 --> 48:13.840
Could be fake.
There's a lot of bad stuff around.

48:13.920 --> 48:16.360
This pearl can rebuild Hablok...

48:16.440 --> 48:19.440
fill its treasury, buy me an army.

48:20.280 --> 48:21.560
Dig it out!

48:21.640 --> 48:24.400
Your Highness,
it may belong to somebody.

48:25.000 --> 48:27.320
It does, and he wants it now!

48:28.679 --> 48:29.759
Yeah.

48:36.119 --> 48:37.919
Use your dagger, fool!

48:58.278 --> 48:59.598
What are you doing?

48:59.678 --> 49:02.278
Falkon, Highness, look at the water!

49:03.278 --> 49:06.078
Come on. Put your back into it.

49:06.558 --> 49:09.597
It won't budge.
Maybe it wasn't meant to come out.

49:09.957 --> 49:12.837
The water is rising.
You must get out of here.

49:22.957 --> 49:25.917
- This way! Make for the stairs!
- Come, my prince!

49:55.915 --> 49:57.995
- Get out of the water!
- Yes.

50:00.155 --> 50:02.155
Climb up here, my prince.

50:34.193 --> 50:35.273
Tarn!

50:36.633 --> 50:38.393
I'm coming, my prince!

50:48.033 --> 50:49.193
Let go!

51:17.031 --> 51:18.431
Where is she?

52:55.227 --> 52:57.507
I can't kill it! It's a machine!

53:13.426 --> 53:15.466
Sonja, we have to blind it!

53:16.626 --> 53:18.346
It's our only chance!

53:46.664 --> 53:49.144
Falkon, get out! It can't see!

54:35.182 --> 54:37.622
There. Keep it covered.

54:39.502 --> 54:41.422
Why have you been following me?

54:41.502 --> 54:43.862
To see that you reach the talisman safely.

54:43.942 --> 54:45.061
Why?

54:45.381 --> 54:48.421
I have to be sure
that the talisman is destroyed.

54:48.981 --> 54:51.381
Centuries ago, the high lords of Arcadia...

54:51.461 --> 54:54.261
had entrusted the talisman
to the priestesses...

54:54.341 --> 54:56.621
because only women may touch it.

54:56.941 --> 54:59.861
But to guard it,
or to destroy it if need be...

55:00.421 --> 55:02.821
is still the duty of the High Lord.

55:02.981 --> 55:04.941
You? The High Lord?

55:06.740 --> 55:09.900
I was coming to the temple
to see the talisman destroyed...

55:09.940 --> 55:12.140
when l found your sister dying...

55:12.220 --> 55:14.740
and learnt that the talisman
had been stolen.

55:15.340 --> 55:17.100
So she guided me to you.

55:17.180 --> 55:19.620
Why didn't you tell me who you were?

55:21.060 --> 55:23.500
You didn't seem to want a man's help.

55:23.580 --> 55:26.539
But you needed it,
so that's why l followed you.

55:27.139 --> 55:29.859
I had to be sure you reached the talisman.

55:30.659 --> 55:31.779
I see.

55:32.819 --> 55:35.859
I misunderstood.
I thought you had another reason.

55:43.379 --> 55:44.539
I did.

55:54.138 --> 55:56.858
No. I'm under a vow.

55:59.858 --> 56:03.378
No man may have me
unless he has beaten me in a fair fight.

56:08.497 --> 56:12.457
So the only man that can have you
is one who has tried to kill you.

56:14.697 --> 56:16.097
That's logic.

56:43.176 --> 56:46.936
If you yield only to a conqueror,
then prepare to be conquered.

56:58.415 --> 57:01.415
Don't be a fool. I don't want to kill you.

57:02.055 --> 57:03.175
Try it.

57:11.174 --> 57:12.414
Come on.

57:21.494 --> 57:24.094
Keep it down over there.
We're trying to sleep.

57:43.773 --> 57:45.373
Are you all right?

57:45.573 --> 57:48.453
Yes, Prince. We were just practicing.

57:49.533 --> 57:51.093
Then let me down!

57:58.172 --> 57:59.452
Thank you.

59:19.288 --> 59:21.288
Why does she fight so hard?

59:21.888 --> 59:23.768
She doesn't want to win.

01:00:58.604 --> 01:01:02.363
Gedren's army.
Another kingdom enslaved.

01:01:30.642 --> 01:01:33.002
The talisman! We must find a way in.

01:01:46.161 --> 01:01:47.841
We'll have to climb.

01:01:52.001 --> 01:01:53.921
Three of us should go in.

01:01:54.001 --> 01:01:57.481
Who'll stand guard this doorway,
the post of danger?

01:01:58.321 --> 01:02:00.281
- Falkon?
- Me? Here?

01:02:00.361 --> 01:02:03.161
I don't know what's coming out that door.
No, l am going up.

01:02:03.241 --> 01:02:04.400
Coward!

01:02:04.680 --> 01:02:06.840
I'll take my chances in there.

01:02:07.200 --> 01:02:08.920
And l have to go in.

01:02:20.280 --> 01:02:21.560
I'll stay.

01:02:29.399 --> 01:02:31.279
Take care, Your Highness.

01:02:47.198 --> 01:02:48.438
Thank you.

01:04:07.515 --> 01:04:09.435
Tomorrow, l start my diet.

01:04:14.034 --> 01:04:16.674
Majesty, the talisman
is almost beyond control.

01:04:16.754 --> 01:04:19.194
We must bury it in the dark
before it is too late!

01:04:19.274 --> 01:04:22.914
It'll be buried when l have no further use
for it, and that time is not yet.

01:04:22.994 --> 01:04:26.714
But it will kill us all!
O God, Majesty, what do you want?

01:04:26.994 --> 01:04:30.394
Our vaults are brimming with gold.
Great states live in terror of us!

01:04:30.474 --> 01:04:32.953
- What more is there?
- The world, Ikol!

01:04:33.233 --> 01:04:36.313
Today we took another piece
of the city of Toktyl.

01:04:36.393 --> 01:04:39.953
But l have wider claims
and the talisman will enforce them!

01:04:40.953 --> 01:04:43.433
Madness. There will be no world.

01:04:44.473 --> 01:04:47.073
There will be no world.

01:05:44.310 --> 01:05:48.070
We must find the talisman.
Only l can touch it, remember.

01:05:49.390 --> 01:05:53.430
You take that way, l'll go the other way.
Falkon, you take the center.

01:06:04.429 --> 01:06:06.429
How's the food around here?

01:06:07.429 --> 01:06:08.749
Who are you?

01:07:13.546 --> 01:07:15.986
- Look for the talisman.
- Yeah. Right.

01:07:36.425 --> 01:07:39.224
- Ikol, Gedren's black spider.
- You.

01:07:39.304 --> 01:07:41.704
Yes. Prince Tarn of Hablok:

01:07:41.784 --> 01:07:44.984
The city you blasted
with your filthy sorcery.

01:07:48.744 --> 01:07:51.584
So the royal brat hasn't learnt his lesson.

01:07:52.344 --> 01:07:54.064
Out of my way, child.

01:07:54.984 --> 01:07:57.944
So that you can desert,
like the thief you are?

01:07:59.304 --> 01:08:00.823
With my gold?

01:08:01.623 --> 01:08:03.063
Hablok's gold?

01:08:08.903 --> 01:08:12.303
Now that was unmannerly
of Your Highness...

01:08:12.903 --> 01:08:16.223
and rude little boys need correction...

01:08:16.542 --> 01:08:19.622
if they're going to grow up into...

01:08:27.462 --> 01:08:31.102
l'm afraid Your Highness' growth
is going to be stunted permanently.

01:08:35.942 --> 01:08:39.142
Now, yield, Black Spider.

01:09:25.618 --> 01:09:27.339
Where's Queen Gedren?

01:09:27.419 --> 01:09:30.179
She's gone. I'm so glad that you've come.

01:09:32.618 --> 01:09:35.578
Please, will you protect me?
I'm so frightened.

01:09:48.218 --> 01:09:51.457
Gedren! Where are you?

01:09:53.537 --> 01:09:57.538
So the Prince of Hablok
honors us with his presence unwisely.

01:09:57.858 --> 01:10:02.138
How many are with you?
Tell me! How many are with you?

01:10:02.898 --> 01:10:05.657
- How many?
- Enough, Gedren!

01:10:10.177 --> 01:10:13.137
Get back, or Hablok will need
an heir to the throne.

01:10:13.217 --> 01:10:15.137
And your own throne, Gedren.

01:10:15.217 --> 01:10:19.017
Unless the talisman goes into the dark,
your whole kingdom will...

01:10:23.257 --> 01:10:25.457
Prince, get Kalidor and Falkon.

01:10:26.856 --> 01:10:29.096
There's a way behind the throne.

01:10:30.656 --> 01:10:32.856
The talisman, Gedren. Quickly!

01:10:33.296 --> 01:10:37.256
You are a fool.
We could have ruled the world together.

01:10:37.336 --> 01:10:41.696
Now l shall rule alone,
and you will die for what you did to me.

01:10:41.776 --> 01:10:43.136
What l did?

01:10:43.616 --> 01:10:46.336
You slaughtered my parents like cattle.

01:10:46.416 --> 01:10:48.855
My brother, my sister!

01:10:49.095 --> 01:10:51.735
Vermin! What were their lives
compared to this?

01:10:52.775 --> 01:10:56.175
You are mad!
The talisman will destroy you.

01:11:53.052 --> 01:11:54.692
Up here, Sonja.

01:11:56.572 --> 01:11:57.772
Up here.

01:14:05.526 --> 01:14:09.286
Kalidor, Falkon, this way! Hurry!

01:14:36.605 --> 01:14:38.524
Down this hallway!

01:14:50.684 --> 01:14:52.724
Sonja. Over here.

01:15:05.483 --> 01:15:06.923
Falkon, help.

01:15:21.042 --> 01:15:22.442
Prince Tarn, come back.

01:15:22.522 --> 01:15:25.962
I am here, Gedren. Death to all tyrants.

01:15:53.401 --> 01:15:55.121
Sonja, help me!

01:15:55.441 --> 01:15:56.801
I'm trapped!

01:16:01.480 --> 01:16:04.360
Sonja! Behind you!

01:17:14.877 --> 01:17:16.557
I can't get through.

01:17:19.277 --> 01:17:22.157
Falkon, pull her through. I'll hold the gate.

01:18:22.234 --> 01:18:24.474
Follow me. This is the way out.

01:18:31.433 --> 01:18:32.913
How do you know, Highness?

01:18:32.993 --> 01:18:35.593
Because this is the way
l came in, you clown.

01:18:46.993 --> 01:18:48.713
Here's the way through.

01:18:48.793 --> 01:18:50.152
Go. Quickly!

01:19:13.351 --> 01:19:14.631
The door doesn't move.

01:19:14.711 --> 01:19:15.911
How does it open?

01:19:15.991 --> 01:19:17.831
I know. Leave it to me.

01:19:18.711 --> 01:19:20.511
No! Come back, Prince!

01:19:32.150 --> 01:19:33.550
He's done it.

01:19:33.630 --> 01:19:36.950
We can't leave him.
Wait here, my prince. Don't go away.

01:19:40.990 --> 01:19:43.350
Save yourselves! Run for it!

01:19:43.430 --> 01:19:45.990
You, too, Falkon, you great, clumsy oaf!

01:19:46.310 --> 01:19:48.310
Run! Run for it!

01:19:48.390 --> 01:19:50.990
I'm not leaving here without you,
my prince.

01:19:52.989 --> 01:19:56.349
Give me your hand. Reach. I'll get you out.

01:21:04.066 --> 01:21:05.826
Hablok is over there.

01:21:05.986 --> 01:21:08.866
When it's rebuilt,
you must come to visit us.

01:21:09.066 --> 01:21:11.386
I'm sure to need a queen someday.

01:21:11.426 --> 01:21:12.986
You'll find one.

01:21:13.186 --> 01:21:16.225
Whoever she is, Prince, choose carefully.

01:21:16.785 --> 01:21:21.185
I make it a rule never to take a woman
unless she can beat me in a fair fight.

01:21:21.745 --> 01:21:24.745
That's a challenge
l might think about someday.

01:21:25.505 --> 01:21:27.225
What about right now?

01:21:33.225 --> 01:21:34.425
Why not?

01:22:05.183 --> 01:22:06.863
Come along, Falkon.

01:22:07.663 --> 01:22:08.583
Come on.

01:24:55.375 --> 01:24:56.335
