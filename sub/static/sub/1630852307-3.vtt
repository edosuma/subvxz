WEBVTT

00:01.131 --> 00:03.829
- I still got some sh--
at your house, too, I need.

00:03.873 --> 00:07.007
I want my Fendi sh--.
Where's my Versace robe at?

00:07.050 --> 00:10.010
Shoot.
That ain't yours.

00:10.053 --> 00:12.577
- Previously, on
"Porsha's Family Matters"...

00:12.621 --> 00:15.841
- I had a son,
and he was a playboy.

00:15.885 --> 00:18.844
- Well, he's not
a playboy, though.

00:18.888 --> 00:20.629
To what extent?
To what extent?

00:20.672 --> 00:23.153
- We decided that it might
be best for us

00:23.197 --> 00:25.068
to go do a spiritual retreat.

00:25.112 --> 00:26.678
- Yeah.
- Girls trip!

00:26.722 --> 00:28.854
Clearly, we have a big-ass
misunderstanding, right now.

00:28.898 --> 00:29.942
So, I--

00:29.986 --> 00:30.943
- Please don't
use that language.

00:30.987 --> 00:31.901
Okay.
- My apologies to you.

00:31.944 --> 00:33.511
- Oh, I get an apology.

00:33.555 --> 00:36.862
- When someone mentions that
Dennis was a cheater,

00:36.906 --> 00:37.994
you get upset.

00:38.038 --> 00:39.126
- Okay, but you were
a cheater, too,

00:39.169 --> 00:41.041
according to a certain person.

00:41.084 --> 00:42.955
- A certain person who?
- Your mom.

00:42.999 --> 00:45.610
- I am trying to be
the bigger person

00:45.654 --> 00:48.657
so that I can at least
get her to Mexico

00:48.700 --> 00:51.355
and let Lauren splash
some spiritual water on her.

00:51.399 --> 00:53.488
Lovin' ain't easy,
but we're gonna figure it out.

00:53.531 --> 00:54.793
- All right.

00:54.837 --> 00:55.794
And on that, I will
accept your invitation.

00:55.838 --> 00:57.013
Okay.

00:57.057 --> 00:58.667
- Cheers.

00:58.710 --> 01:02.540
- Yes.
Hi, family.

01:30.220 --> 01:33.049
- Are you fixing your boob?
- Yes.

01:33.093 --> 01:34.746
- I looked at the window,
and it was hey.

01:34.790 --> 01:37.314
- I was, like, trying to do it
while holding the bottle.

01:37.358 --> 01:39.577
It wasn't working very well.
- Oh, my God.

01:39.621 --> 01:42.189
Hey, bottle.
- Hey, yes, bottle, bottle.

01:42.232 --> 01:44.452
- I'm excited. All right.
- Hi, hi.

01:44.495 --> 01:46.236
- So, I gotta get, um,
I gotta get glasses for us.

01:46.280 --> 01:49.370
- Okay.
- So we can champagne it up.

01:49.413 --> 01:51.981
Glasses.

01:52.024 --> 01:54.114
- Glasses, yay.
- Glasses, yes.

01:54.157 --> 01:58.292
So, what have you been up to?
- Working, for the most part.

01:58.335 --> 01:59.902
I just realized y'all had
that dollhouse, right now.

01:59.945 --> 02:01.382
- I know.

02:01.425 --> 02:02.774
You know, Baleigh's toys
kinda shift around the house.

02:02.818 --> 02:03.601
- Yes.

02:03.645 --> 02:04.602
- I mean, 'cause sometimes

02:04.646 --> 02:05.516
if I need to do something
in here,

02:05.560 --> 02:06.778
I would rather just have
her toys

02:06.822 --> 02:07.953
in the middle of the floor

02:07.997 --> 02:09.520
and be getting
what I need to get done

02:09.564 --> 02:10.956
while she does what she does.

02:11.000 --> 02:13.785
- So, um, what were
your opinions on the barbecue?

02:13.829 --> 02:16.048
- I know how it was for me,
but I wanna hear your side.

02:16.092 --> 02:18.921
- Um, awkward.

02:18.964 --> 02:20.140
They decided to
all of a sudden

02:20.183 --> 02:22.185
praise Simon
one by one.

02:22.229 --> 02:24.274
- When we were out at Republic
the other night,

02:24.318 --> 02:25.710
it just seemed like
y'all were just, like,

02:25.754 --> 02:27.451
had this, like, little,
like, vibe and connection.

02:27.495 --> 02:29.845
It was real cool.
- Oh, thank you.

02:29.888 --> 02:32.108
- And then little Granny Iona.

02:32.152 --> 02:33.936
- Yeah, Miss Iona is like--
- Gets up.

02:33.979 --> 02:34.937
- Yeah.

02:34.980 --> 02:38.549
- And shows her
entire buttocks.

02:38.593 --> 02:40.595
- I had a son,
and he was a playboy.

02:40.638 --> 02:42.423
- Well, he's not
a playboy, though.

02:42.466 --> 02:44.164
- It was-- it was tense.
Yeah.

02:44.207 --> 02:45.382
- It was the playboy comment.

02:45.426 --> 02:47.428
Porsha's two sides
of the family,

02:47.471 --> 02:52.607
we have the Williams, Aunt Liz,
me, Lauren, and Porsha,

02:52.650 --> 02:55.871
and then Porsha has
her mom's side of the family,

02:55.914 --> 03:01.006
Aunt Diane, Darlene, Storm,
Grandma Iona.

03:01.050 --> 03:02.312
I was a bit shocked.

03:02.356 --> 03:04.967
Maybe it's just Porsha's
other side of the family.

03:05.010 --> 03:06.708
So, if I had to compare the two,

03:06.751 --> 03:09.363
Porsha's mom's side
of the family--

03:09.406 --> 03:11.452
I'm not calling them
country bumpkins.

03:11.495 --> 03:13.628
I'm just saying
we were raised differently.

03:13.671 --> 03:16.674
It's definitely a difference.

03:16.718 --> 03:17.893
- I wanna see
what mommy thought.

03:17.936 --> 03:19.242
Mommy!

03:19.286 --> 03:20.374
- Hi, Aunt Lisa.

03:20.417 --> 03:22.027
- Hi, honey.
are ya?

03:22.071 --> 03:23.246
- Good.
How are you?

03:23.290 --> 03:24.247
- I'm good.
You look cute today.

03:24.291 --> 03:25.553
- Oh, Baleigh.

03:25.596 --> 03:26.597
- Yeah, she walks around
giving a look every day.

03:26.641 --> 03:28.686
- Look at your little dresses.

03:28.730 --> 03:31.211
I don't get a hug?

03:31.254 --> 03:32.473
Hi, Baleigh.
Hi, Baleigh.

03:32.516 --> 03:33.909
Hi.

03:33.952 --> 03:36.912
You look so cute.
- Thank you.

03:36.955 --> 03:39.828
- Um, so, we were talking
about the cookout.

03:39.871 --> 03:41.351
- Mm-hmm.

03:41.395 --> 03:43.745
- And how Miss Iona and
Miss Gina got a little tense.

03:43.788 --> 03:44.876
- Mm-hmm.

03:44.920 --> 03:45.964
- What happened?
Did we miss something?

03:46.008 --> 03:47.488
- You know,
Porsha's grandmother,

03:47.531 --> 03:50.534
and Diane, and Darlene,
I mean, Porsha is their world.

03:50.578 --> 03:54.930
With Dennis and Gina, you know,
they're looking at it

03:54.973 --> 03:56.540
from his perspective.

03:56.584 --> 03:58.760
- Usually, this takes years
for people to get engaged.

03:58.803 --> 03:59.804
You know what I mean?
- Right, right.

03:59.848 --> 04:00.979
Mm-hmm.

04:01.023 --> 04:02.503
- Like, all this
happened very suddenly.

04:02.546 --> 04:03.939
Porsha made this decision,
and it's affecting everyone,

04:03.982 --> 04:06.507
and everybody is not dealing
with it in the best way.

04:06.550 --> 04:08.596
- And it's super
extenuating circumstances.

04:08.639 --> 04:10.424
- Yeah.
- Dennis is hurt,

04:10.467 --> 04:12.295
so I think
he still has some feelings.

04:12.339 --> 04:13.514
I don't know.

04:13.557 --> 04:14.732
I'm still confused
about the whole thing.

04:14.776 --> 04:15.907
- Yeah.

04:15.951 --> 04:17.518
- So, what are your plans
for the trip?

04:17.561 --> 04:21.173
- I definitely had some ideas,
like shamanic drum circles.

04:21.217 --> 04:23.654
I'd love for us
to go get into nature.

04:23.698 --> 04:25.961
- Okay.
- Into some bodies of water.

04:26.004 --> 04:28.833
- Bales, can we go upstairs
and get some more toys

04:28.877 --> 04:29.921
for you to bring down?

04:29.965 --> 04:32.924
Okay, let's go.

04:32.968 --> 04:35.013
- Bye, Baleigh.
- Bye.

04:35.057 --> 04:37.277
- Is Dom coming?
- Yeah.

04:37.320 --> 04:39.714
I've known Dom
seven to eight years.

04:39.757 --> 04:42.586
I was able to get him a job
with Porsha,

04:42.630 --> 04:44.762
so he became
Porsha's assistant.

04:44.806 --> 04:46.982
And there was a lot of me
yelling at both of them

04:47.025 --> 04:48.331
while he was working for her.

04:48.375 --> 04:49.898
But since he's not working for
Porsha anymore,

04:49.941 --> 04:52.335
we've just maintained
a really good friendship.

04:52.379 --> 04:54.163
I also told Porsha that
I think we should invite

04:54.206 --> 04:55.730
Dennis and Simon.

04:55.773 --> 04:58.820
In addition to Mama Gina,
I was actually thinking

04:58.863 --> 05:01.823
let's bring the men.

05:01.866 --> 05:03.868
I'll tell 'em. I'll invite.
- You tell 'em then.

05:03.912 --> 05:05.783
- Wait, what?

05:05.827 --> 05:08.612
- I feel like Dennis and Simon
are wrapped up in

05:08.656 --> 05:11.398
all of the issues that are
going on in Porsha's family.

05:11.441 --> 05:13.400
They should come on the trip.

05:13.443 --> 05:15.489
Porsha is gonna
get Simon to come.

05:15.532 --> 05:18.318
I'm gonna get Dennis to come,
and you're gonna help me.

05:18.361 --> 05:19.667
- Uh-huh.
I love Dennis.

05:19.710 --> 05:20.929
I've always loved Dennis.
- I-I do love Dennis.

05:20.972 --> 05:23.192
Dennis is a really important
part of Porsha

05:23.235 --> 05:24.411
and Pilar's happiness,

05:24.454 --> 05:26.674
so I really need Dennis
to say yes

05:26.717 --> 05:28.371
because Porsha can't
blend her family

05:28.415 --> 05:29.503
if Dennis isn't there.

05:29.546 --> 05:32.897
Mission-- get Dennis
to this retreat.

05:32.941 --> 05:34.899
- It's the trade.
It's the trade for me.

05:34.943 --> 05:37.685
- Wait, what?
- He has two Versace robes.

05:37.728 --> 05:39.034
- Okay.

05:39.077 --> 05:40.470
- And then it's a Fendi jumpsuit
at Porsha's house

05:40.514 --> 05:41.819
that he really wants back.

05:45.997 --> 05:47.390
We're gonna have to sneak
and get it from Porsha

05:47.434 --> 05:48.391
'cause Porsha
is gonna be pissed

05:48.435 --> 05:49.523
if we take that
out of the house.

05:49.566 --> 05:50.654
Lauren Wilson
will know where it is.

05:50.698 --> 05:52.134
- Lauren is gonna help. Yeah.
- Okay.

05:52.177 --> 05:53.657
Then we call Dennis.
- Okay.

05:53.701 --> 05:55.224
If you want these...
- If you want these back...

05:55.267 --> 05:57.574
- You'll come on this trip.

05:57.618 --> 05:59.228
All right.
- Anyway.

05:59.271 --> 06:01.186
- So, we got a mission.

06:07.671 --> 06:09.369
- PJ, you want some eggs?

06:09.412 --> 06:11.675
Eggs, please.

06:11.719 --> 06:12.807
Okay.

06:12.850 --> 06:14.504
You got to stay out of school
two days

06:14.548 --> 06:16.767
since you don't feel good.

06:19.857 --> 06:22.382
- So, what's our gameplan?
Did you text Lauren?

06:22.425 --> 06:24.340
- I text her.
- Let's call her.

06:26.342 --> 06:28.213
- Hello.

06:28.257 --> 06:29.824
- Hey.

06:29.867 --> 06:32.957
- So, what we're trying to do,
is get some of Dennis' stuff,

06:33.001 --> 06:34.394
the two Versace robes
and the Fendi jumpsuit.

06:34.437 --> 06:35.699
- Yeah.

06:35.743 --> 06:39.094
- So, we're gonna try to
steal them from Porsha's.

06:39.137 --> 06:41.139
We're spying.

06:41.183 --> 06:42.750
- So, since you're gonna
be here,

06:42.793 --> 06:44.621
can you kinda be
a little decoy?

06:45.535 --> 06:47.450
- All right.
Goodbye.

06:47.494 --> 06:48.973
- Okay, bye.

06:49.017 --> 06:50.192
- We're gonna be
the worst spies ever.

06:50.235 --> 06:52.542
- Dennis better say yes.
That's all I know.

06:52.586 --> 06:55.023
- Hey, good morning.
- Hey.

06:55.066 --> 06:57.504
- Good morning.
Are you feeling better?

06:57.547 --> 06:59.114
- She was just a little warm
when she woke up.

06:59.157 --> 07:00.724
- Good morning.
Yeah?

07:00.768 --> 07:02.117
- But...

07:02.160 --> 07:02.770
- She's better
from last night?

07:02.813 --> 07:04.075
- Yes.
Mm-hmm.

07:04.119 --> 07:06.469
- Are you ready for the trip?
Are you excited?

07:06.513 --> 07:07.775
I know.
- I am.

07:07.818 --> 07:09.254
I think it's gonna be good.

07:09.298 --> 07:11.953
I think we'll be probably
talking about a lotta things

07:11.996 --> 07:14.085
that we need to talk about,
like Mama Gina and her stuff

07:14.129 --> 07:16.697
or whatever.

07:16.740 --> 07:20.701
- You ready?
- Ready.

07:20.744 --> 07:21.963
All right.
- Let's go.

07:22.006 --> 07:24.966
- All right. All right.
We gotta be quiet.

07:25.009 --> 07:26.489
Okay.
All right.

07:26.533 --> 07:27.882
- I gotta figure out
how I'm gonna do my hair

07:27.925 --> 07:29.971
for this trip.

07:30.014 --> 07:33.148
I was looking at, um,
at braids like I had

07:33.191 --> 07:34.410
for my birthday trip.

07:34.454 --> 07:36.194
- Okay, yeah.
- Um...

07:36.238 --> 07:37.500
- All right.
Come on. Come on.

07:37.544 --> 07:39.110
- Lauren. Lauren.

07:39.154 --> 07:40.416
- What I was thinking was,
like, you know

07:40.460 --> 07:43.724
how I had them braided
in the front.

07:43.767 --> 07:46.509
Remember I said I would just do,
like, the sewing in the back?

07:46.553 --> 07:47.945
- Oh, yeah.

07:47.989 --> 07:48.816
- And then just have, like,
half up and half down.

07:48.859 --> 07:49.991
- Yeah.

07:50.034 --> 07:52.950
- I don't have
anything to cover it.

07:52.994 --> 07:55.518
- But you know your
braider is good.

07:55.562 --> 08:00.392
- Okay.
Hold on.

08:00.436 --> 08:01.481
All right.

08:01.524 --> 08:03.657
Okay, it's a bunch
of stuff in here.

08:03.700 --> 08:05.485
Oh, sh--.
Shh, Londie.

08:05.528 --> 08:07.138
- Yes, yes.
- Londie.

08:07.182 --> 08:09.967
You can't be dropping sh--.

08:10.011 --> 08:11.578
- But the curly would be good
for vacation.

08:11.621 --> 08:12.709
- Definitely.

08:12.753 --> 08:14.581
- Um, who do you think
could do that?

08:14.624 --> 08:16.496
- I don't see
the Versace robe.

08:16.539 --> 08:18.933
It's really weird that Porsha
has a bunch of Dennis' stuff.

08:18.976 --> 08:19.977
I don't know.

08:20.021 --> 08:21.196
I throw my ex's
stuff away, okay?

08:21.239 --> 08:22.632
We break up,
your stuff goes.

08:22.676 --> 08:24.373
Bye-bye.
We're doing her a favor.

08:24.416 --> 08:27.550
We're getting rid of Dennis
completely out of her house.

08:27.594 --> 08:30.335
All right.
Mission to get Dennis--

08:30.379 --> 08:31.293
There it is, right there.

08:31.336 --> 08:33.600
Oh, my God, look.
Oh, my God.

08:33.643 --> 08:34.992
Oh, my God, it's right there.

08:37.908 --> 08:42.304
All right.
We got one.

08:42.347 --> 08:43.827
We need to go to the basement,

08:43.871 --> 08:45.394
which means we have to
walk right by her.

08:45.437 --> 08:46.482
- It's so cute.

08:46.526 --> 08:47.483
- That straight is bomb,
too, though.

08:47.527 --> 08:49.006
- It's really cute.

08:49.050 --> 08:50.617
- But the curly would
be good for vacation.

08:50.660 --> 08:52.096
- Definitely.

08:58.363 --> 08:59.930
- We'll get the furs alright.

09:01.671 --> 09:05.066
- Come on.
We're gonna get in trouble.

09:05.109 --> 09:08.156
- You want some eggs?
- Okay, yeah.

09:08.199 --> 09:10.419
- What you looking forward to
'cause you're going, too?

09:10.462 --> 09:12.290
- Yeah.
- You gonna do some yoga?

09:12.334 --> 09:15.642
- And some meditation?
- Mm-hmm.

09:15.685 --> 09:18.514
- What if she came out
right now?

09:18.558 --> 09:20.385
Champagne poppin'.
- All right, okay.

09:20.429 --> 09:23.040
- All the furs.
- Okay, all right.

09:23.084 --> 09:25.347
- Go, go, go, go.
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

09:25.390 --> 09:26.435
- And we're off.

09:26.478 --> 09:30.004
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my gosh.

09:30.047 --> 09:31.701
- Dennis is coming
on the trip.

09:31.745 --> 09:32.876
- Oh, my gosh.
- Coming up...

09:32.920 --> 09:34.878
Dom walked by me,
and he was like,

09:34.922 --> 09:38.099
"Why they got me
carrying Dennis' robe?"

09:38.142 --> 09:39.404
- Well, who got it 'cause
there ain't that many people?

09:39.448 --> 09:40.841
- We're gonna find out.

09:52.287 --> 09:54.245
- Chile.

09:54.289 --> 09:57.292
- We're ready to be cooking
this Nigerian breakfast.

09:57.335 --> 09:59.468
- Okay, whoa.
- So, yes.

09:59.511 --> 10:02.340
Simon is coming over,
and I want to make him

10:02.384 --> 10:06.736
a Nigerian inspired breakfast.
- Okay.

10:06.780 --> 10:08.172
- You ain't gonna
help me cook?

10:08.216 --> 10:09.521
- Well, I guess I'll be your--

10:09.565 --> 10:10.610
what do they call it--
sous cook.

10:10.653 --> 10:12.742
- Oh, wow.
- Yes, yes, yeah.

10:12.786 --> 10:15.484
- Okay, so, cut those.
- M'kay.

10:15.527 --> 10:17.791
- Okay, let's cut the peppers.

10:17.834 --> 10:20.228
It don't smell that spicy.

10:20.271 --> 10:22.883
I don't know if these is--
are these habanero?

10:22.926 --> 10:25.886
It's not that spicy.
- Okay.

10:25.929 --> 10:29.890
- You missed the other day
with me, Aunt Liz, and Lauren.

10:29.933 --> 10:32.327
- Y'all snuck that in on me?

10:32.370 --> 10:35.896
- So, we had this
whole ritual.

10:35.939 --> 10:38.681
- Mm-hmm.
- At Lena's Oasis.

10:38.725 --> 10:41.641
- Okay.
- It was beautiful.

10:41.684 --> 10:44.078
She cleansed our spirits.

10:44.121 --> 10:45.775
And so, Lauren was like,

10:45.819 --> 10:48.343
"Well, I was thinking about
the trip."

10:48.386 --> 10:49.649
- Mm-hmm.

10:49.692 --> 10:53.478
- "And I also think that
we should bring men."

10:53.522 --> 10:55.045
- Men?
- Uh-huh.

10:55.089 --> 10:57.047
- So, why are the men coming
to bust up our women's trip?

10:57.091 --> 10:59.484
- She feels like for us
to be able to heal as a family

10:59.528 --> 11:01.530
together, then all
the men should come.

11:01.573 --> 11:03.184
- That include Dennis?

11:03.227 --> 11:04.838
- Yeah.
- Okay.

11:04.881 --> 11:07.710
- I haven't really
mentioned it to Simon.

11:07.754 --> 11:09.973
So...
- Mm-hmm.

11:10.017 --> 11:12.193
- I'm gonna mention it
to him today.

11:12.236 --> 11:13.498
- Okay.

11:13.542 --> 11:15.239
- You cannot say that
you're blending a family

11:15.283 --> 11:16.893
and not include everyone,

11:16.937 --> 11:20.244
and I realized that I wasn't
really including Simon.

11:20.288 --> 11:23.944
I want Simon to be able
to get to know Dennis

11:23.987 --> 11:25.772
so that we can all
co-parent,

11:25.815 --> 11:27.382
so that's why
it's very important

11:27.425 --> 11:28.905
for him to come
on the trip.

11:28.949 --> 11:30.298
But what do you
think about it?

11:30.341 --> 11:32.169
- I think they will be fine.

11:32.213 --> 11:35.303
It's his mama
who may be the concern.

11:35.346 --> 11:36.739
- Okay.

11:36.783 --> 11:38.175
- I was really
sittin' on my edge

11:38.219 --> 11:39.829
when she started talking
to mommy like that.

11:39.873 --> 11:42.397
I mean, I-I just don't--
I don't trust myself.

11:42.440 --> 11:43.877
I'll put it that way.

11:45.139 --> 11:47.315
- I'm gonna put these first
since it got a little hot.

11:49.056 --> 11:50.448
Whoa!

11:50.492 --> 11:51.798
Okay.

11:51.841 --> 11:53.625
- So, if we're all gonna
come from an honest place,

11:53.669 --> 11:54.801
I don't see
anything wrong with it,

11:54.844 --> 11:57.151
but I think that's
very hard to do.

11:57.194 --> 11:58.326
- Okay.

11:58.369 --> 12:00.197
Oh, sh--.
- Mm-hmm.

12:01.459 --> 12:02.983
The fire can't be smokin'.

12:05.159 --> 12:07.117
- Hello!

12:07.161 --> 12:08.945
- Hey, baby!

12:08.989 --> 12:11.252
- Hey, darling.
- Hi, boo!

12:11.295 --> 12:12.862
- Ooh, look at you.

12:15.125 --> 12:17.084
What are you cooking here?
Hi, Mom.

12:17.127 --> 12:20.522
- I'm making you a amazing
Nigerian breakfast.

12:20.565 --> 12:21.479
- Are you kidding me
right now?

12:21.523 --> 12:23.307
- Yes.

12:23.351 --> 12:25.440
- I see plantains.
Baby, so, what are you cooking?

12:25.483 --> 12:27.181
Does it have a name?

12:28.835 --> 12:30.967
- When I Google it, it said
Nigerian breakfast, okay?

12:32.839 --> 12:34.188
- I've never been
in a situation

12:34.231 --> 12:37.757
where I constantly felt
somebody took care of me.

12:37.800 --> 12:39.584
I was always
taking care of somebody.

12:39.628 --> 12:41.891
And clearly, I just
met a woman that

12:41.935 --> 12:44.067
my welfare did
matter to her.

12:44.111 --> 12:45.808
It's refreshing.

12:45.852 --> 12:47.027
- But here we go.

12:48.419 --> 12:50.595
- Hi.
- Yes, Nat!

12:50.639 --> 12:51.988
Hi, boo!
- Hi, Simon.

12:52.032 --> 12:53.294
- Hey, what up?
- Hi.

12:53.337 --> 12:54.730
I'm good. How are you?
- Good to see you.

12:54.774 --> 12:56.297
- Nice to see you, too.
- How you been?

12:56.340 --> 12:57.515
- I've been great.

12:57.559 --> 12:58.690
- You remember Nat?

12:58.734 --> 12:59.909
Uh, he was telling me
that he knew you.

12:59.953 --> 13:01.258
- Of course, I remember.
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

13:02.694 --> 13:04.087
- You said you were
gonna ask Simon about

13:04.131 --> 13:06.655
going to this retreat,
what he thought about it.

13:06.698 --> 13:08.744
- Oh.
- Oh.

13:09.876 --> 13:11.834
- Lauren said that you
should come on the trip.

13:11.878 --> 13:13.314
- Yeah?
- Yeah,

13:13.357 --> 13:17.535
because it's more about
a complete family healing.

13:17.579 --> 13:18.493
- Right.
- Like, why have

13:18.536 --> 13:19.755
just the women
be healed?

13:19.799 --> 13:23.150
And, um...

13:23.193 --> 13:26.718
uh, uh...

13:26.762 --> 13:29.896
And I think she mentioned
Dennis comin'.

13:31.114 --> 13:32.855
I'm not sure.

13:37.773 --> 13:38.992
- I don't have
a problem with it.

13:39.035 --> 13:41.777
I'm absolutely for--
I've said repeatedly,

13:41.821 --> 13:43.387
and I'm not joking.

13:43.431 --> 13:46.129
I like where you and Dennis
are starting from as co-parents.

13:46.173 --> 13:48.653
You-you-you're
doing pretty good.

13:48.697 --> 13:50.220
I-I'm fine with it.

13:50.264 --> 13:51.874
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

13:51.918 --> 13:54.224
- Because we've decided
to do this as-as a family--

13:54.268 --> 13:55.225
- Family, yeah.

13:55.269 --> 13:55.878
- We're here to
help each other.

13:55.922 --> 13:57.140
- Help each other.

13:57.184 --> 13:59.099
- Co-parenting is not
a easy thing to do,

13:59.142 --> 14:02.711
and most of my co-parents
I get along with,

14:02.754 --> 14:05.105
but it-it's been
a struggle,

14:05.148 --> 14:07.847
but we figured out a way
to make it work,

14:07.890 --> 14:10.893
and Porsha and Dennis
are doing a great job,

14:10.937 --> 14:13.156
but they should have
a parenting plan.

14:13.200 --> 14:15.593
- They also asked
Gina to come,

14:15.637 --> 14:17.639
and that's what
I-I'm kinda leery about.

14:17.682 --> 14:18.683
- Yeah.

14:18.727 --> 14:19.728
- Well, I don't mind
Gina coming.

14:19.771 --> 14:21.164
The reason why is
because we'll--

14:21.208 --> 14:23.297
I think it's important for her
to embrace reality.

14:23.340 --> 14:24.994
- Absolutely.
- Mmm, that's true.

14:25.038 --> 14:27.040
- And when you
leave her outside,

14:27.083 --> 14:29.651
you leave her to
her mind to wonder

14:29.694 --> 14:32.741
what's truly going on.
- Yeah, mm-hmm.

14:32.784 --> 14:34.351
- Did you taste
your omelet, baby?

14:34.395 --> 14:35.918
- Yes, baby, good job.

14:35.962 --> 14:37.746
- Yeah, it's a little spicy,
but I like hot pepper.

14:37.789 --> 14:40.096
- You wanna taste this?

14:40.140 --> 14:41.968
It's hot as
- Ah!

14:42.011 --> 14:43.404
- See?
- Here you go.

14:44.971 --> 14:47.887
- I must be super Nigerian
because I'm good.

14:47.930 --> 14:50.367
- You're super Nigerian.

15:09.125 --> 15:10.648
How are you?
- Good. How are you?

15:10.692 --> 15:11.867
- Your hair looks
really cute.

15:11.911 --> 15:13.608
- Thank you, thank you.

15:13.651 --> 15:14.957
What's the plan?

15:15.001 --> 15:16.437
- The stuff is in the car.
- Okay.

15:16.480 --> 15:18.221
- So, I was thinking
let's wear the furs.

15:18.265 --> 15:20.006
We're just gonna
run in with 'em

15:20.049 --> 15:22.704
and be like,
"What's up, Dennis?"

15:22.747 --> 15:24.271
I don't think
I would ever be wearing

15:24.314 --> 15:26.490
this weird looking
Detroit fur

15:26.534 --> 15:29.015
had it not been for Porsha
wanting to blend her family.

15:29.058 --> 15:32.105
The things we do for Porsha,
at this point, like, my gosh.

15:32.148 --> 15:34.368
She-she should thank me.
She really should.

15:34.411 --> 15:35.630
All right, let's go.

15:39.895 --> 15:41.897
Can we talk
to you for a sec?

15:41.941 --> 15:44.291
- Y'all got my furs on?

15:44.334 --> 15:45.509
What's up?

15:45.553 --> 15:46.771
- Hey, how are you?

15:46.815 --> 15:48.121
- Y'all are somethin' funny.
- You look nice.

15:48.164 --> 15:49.557
- Why-why come over here
with my fur [indistinct]?

15:49.600 --> 15:50.906
- What's up, Dennis?
- What up?

15:50.950 --> 15:51.994
- Did you miss these?

15:52.038 --> 15:53.474
Did you miss these?
- I-I mean,

15:53.517 --> 15:55.998
them wasn't on-- them wasn't
on my list to get but...

15:56.042 --> 15:58.131
- This is ransom, okay?

15:58.174 --> 15:59.132
- Yo, hold on for
a minute, though.

15:59.175 --> 16:01.090
- You don't-you don't
get these

16:01.134 --> 16:02.570
until you give us
the answer we want.

16:05.094 --> 16:06.487
- Dennis, we're working
with what we have.

16:06.530 --> 16:07.662
- We did.
- Okay?

16:07.705 --> 16:08.924
- We got your Versace robe,

16:08.968 --> 16:10.099
but we're not gonna
give it back just yet.

16:10.143 --> 16:11.405
- We have something
to ask of you,

16:11.448 --> 16:12.667
and we need you to answer

16:12.710 --> 16:14.321
in the way we want
you to answer.

16:14.364 --> 16:15.931
- What?
- Yes.

16:15.975 --> 16:18.803
- I need you in Mexico.

16:18.847 --> 16:22.024
- Hell no.

16:22.068 --> 16:23.286
Ain't no way
I'm going to Mexico.

16:23.330 --> 16:24.331
Ain't no way.
- It's a retreat.

16:24.374 --> 16:25.419
- For what?

16:25.462 --> 16:26.420
- You don't need
to go on a retreat?

16:26.463 --> 16:27.943
- What am I going
to Mexico for?

16:27.987 --> 16:29.684
- Pilar is gonna be there.
Your mom is gonna be there.

16:29.727 --> 16:31.294
- No.

16:34.210 --> 16:35.429
- Since you wanna play
hard ball...

16:35.472 --> 16:37.692
- Do you want the rest
of the robe or not?

16:37.735 --> 16:40.695
We just need to make sure
what happened at the barbecue

16:40.738 --> 16:41.870
never happens again.

16:41.913 --> 16:43.089
- I don't even know--
what was that?

16:43.132 --> 16:44.090
What was that?
- The only way to do that,

16:44.133 --> 16:46.309
is to get together
and be cool.

16:49.095 --> 16:50.618
- I gotta think about this.

16:50.661 --> 16:52.402
I already know Mexico
is gonna turn into...

16:58.234 --> 17:01.150
You know, it-it's
a bad idea all around,

17:01.194 --> 17:03.196
and for PJ's sake,
it could be important,

17:03.239 --> 17:05.459
but I just feel there's
a lotta hidden agendas there.

17:05.502 --> 17:07.722
I'm gonna just make
my own call, at this point.

17:07.765 --> 17:10.377
I'm not feeling it.

17:10.420 --> 17:12.205
Y'all don't think it's weird
that I come to Mexico,

17:12.248 --> 17:14.859
and Porsha and her husband
is kissy-facing,

17:14.903 --> 17:16.731
and y'all are crying.

17:16.774 --> 17:17.732
What I'm gonna do there?

17:17.775 --> 17:19.081
- I think you can
have some fun.

17:19.125 --> 17:21.083
You don't have to come
to everything that I do.

17:21.127 --> 17:22.302
- So, with
the Williams family,

17:22.345 --> 17:24.347
it-it's always,
um, a healing process.

17:24.391 --> 17:26.697
N-nothing has ever
been healed, though.

17:26.741 --> 17:28.569
- I'm gonna send you a list.
I'm gonna text you a list,

17:28.612 --> 17:29.918
a-a packing list.

17:29.961 --> 17:32.399
I'd love for you to
bring some crystals.

17:32.442 --> 17:34.270
- I may see y'all
out there, maybe.

17:34.314 --> 17:35.924
I gotta see
what's going on.

17:35.967 --> 17:37.099
- You're coming to heal?

17:37.143 --> 17:39.014
- Can I get
my Versace robe, though?

17:39.058 --> 17:40.755
- Not until Mexico.
- In Mexico.

17:40.798 --> 17:42.148
Are we taking shots?

17:42.191 --> 17:44.150
- Tatiana, can I
get three shots?

17:44.193 --> 17:45.934
- So, this means
you're going?

17:45.977 --> 17:47.370
- Cheers to Mexico.
- Are you coming?

17:47.414 --> 17:49.068
- Yo quiero...

17:49.111 --> 17:50.243
- It's not even tequila.

17:50.286 --> 17:51.766
- I don't know any
more Spanish words.

17:51.809 --> 17:52.941
- I gotta think about Mexico.

17:52.984 --> 17:54.464
- All right, playboy.

17:54.508 --> 17:55.596
- Coming up next...

17:55.639 --> 17:58.599
- She said that
I cheated on Dennis,

17:58.642 --> 18:00.514
and she said you told her.

18:00.557 --> 18:01.950
- I told her what?

18:01.993 --> 18:04.474
- They act like she's
so innocent when she's not.

18:11.742 --> 18:13.222
- I have a question.

18:13.266 --> 18:15.442
Where are we going?

18:15.485 --> 18:17.400
- We're gonna go on
a spiritual retreat,

18:17.444 --> 18:19.141
and you're gonna
come with me this time.

18:19.185 --> 18:21.143
- Only if we
go to the beach.

18:21.187 --> 18:23.232
- Yes.
- And no meditating.

18:23.276 --> 18:25.626
- Well, everybody is gonna do
a little bit of meditating.

18:25.669 --> 18:27.628
- Not on my watch.

18:28.716 --> 18:30.283
- Uh, Baleigh was asking me
why I'm packing

18:30.326 --> 18:31.762
and where I'm going.
- Oh.

18:31.806 --> 18:33.416
- How do you feel about me

18:33.460 --> 18:34.896
being the leader
of this group?

18:34.939 --> 18:36.767
Do you feel like they're
gonna listen to me?

18:36.811 --> 18:39.422
- Absolutely.
I think everyone

18:39.466 --> 18:43.165
sees you as a leader
of sorts already.

18:43.209 --> 18:44.384
- Okay.
- You know,

18:44.427 --> 18:46.168
you're kinda the glue
that's going to be

18:46.212 --> 18:47.517
bringing this group together.

18:47.561 --> 18:48.779
- Mm-hmm.

18:48.823 --> 18:50.390
I'm preaching this retreat
to everybody else

18:50.433 --> 18:52.043
but maybe this Mexico
is what I need.

18:52.087 --> 18:53.349
- Right, it's for you.

18:53.393 --> 18:55.786
I think, in a weird kinda way,
it really is.

19:00.356 --> 19:02.489
- Let me show
you this piece.

19:02.532 --> 19:04.926
This actually
goes across here.

19:04.969 --> 19:05.883
- Uh-huh.

19:05.927 --> 19:10.714
- And the bottom
is this train.

19:10.758 --> 19:12.281
You like that?
- You're gonna look like
a queen.

19:12.325 --> 19:13.935
- Yes.

19:16.198 --> 19:17.939
- Let me see.

19:17.982 --> 19:21.421
- So, this is, um,
one of my pieces that I got.

19:21.464 --> 19:22.639
- That's cute.

19:22.683 --> 19:24.163
Why do you get
your stuff so big, though?

19:24.206 --> 19:25.947
- Because that's the
way it's supposed to go.

19:25.990 --> 19:28.515
I'm actually
looking forward to

19:28.558 --> 19:29.820
spending some time
with Porsha

19:29.864 --> 19:31.605
because Porsha has
always been like

19:31.648 --> 19:33.215
a big sister to me.

19:33.259 --> 19:36.000
- You know, what I really
wanna do, is bond with you.

19:36.044 --> 19:38.525
So, I think this is
just what the doctor ordered.

19:39.395 --> 19:41.180
- Ooh, no, we're
in trouble now.

19:41.223 --> 19:43.356
Oh, yes, Lauren.

19:43.399 --> 19:44.748
- Ahh!

19:44.792 --> 19:46.315
The top has fringes.

19:46.359 --> 19:49.318
- Ahh!

19:49.362 --> 19:52.713
Oh, yes, honey.
I'm retreat ready.

19:53.975 --> 19:56.238
- This-- no.

19:56.282 --> 19:57.848
She was telling me
I need to be appropriate,

19:57.892 --> 19:59.023
and I was like,
first of all,

19:59.067 --> 20:00.721
Lauren can't tell me
what to wear,

20:00.764 --> 20:02.244
all right?

20:02.288 --> 20:04.115
So, when I found this--

20:04.159 --> 20:05.813
- Oh, look, you could
wear these with them.

20:05.856 --> 20:08.511
- Ooh, see?
Look, see how fast.

20:08.555 --> 20:10.165
See how fast
she got on the boat?

20:10.209 --> 20:12.036
- Yeah.

20:22.264 --> 20:23.526
- Hi, how are you?

20:23.570 --> 20:25.354
Can I help you
with anything?

20:25.398 --> 20:26.921
- Well, I'm meeting
my son here.

20:26.964 --> 20:29.489
I know he said we're gonna be
looking for some crystals.

20:29.532 --> 20:30.838
- Oh, okay.

20:33.623 --> 20:35.538
- How you doin'?
- I'm good. How are you?

20:35.582 --> 20:37.323
If you have any questions,

20:37.366 --> 20:38.715
we can tell you
all about it

20:38.759 --> 20:40.239
and give you
some suggestions.

20:40.282 --> 20:41.805
- Oh, okay, great.

20:41.849 --> 20:43.894
- Let me check that out.
- So, yeah, take a look at that.

20:43.938 --> 20:45.722
- So, Lauren said you need
to bring some stones wit' you

20:45.766 --> 20:48.377
on this trip
you're going on.

20:48.421 --> 20:49.596
- Well, aren't you going?

20:49.639 --> 20:51.511
- I don't know about that.

20:51.554 --> 20:53.295
Maybe get some divine.
- I don't know much
about crystals.

20:53.339 --> 20:56.211
This is kinda whoo-hoo.
- Some divine feminine things
going on.

20:56.255 --> 20:58.605
This kinda, like, spooky.

21:00.998 --> 21:02.739
- If you're going, you need
to get some, too, come on.

21:02.783 --> 21:04.524
- I may get one
just in case.

21:04.567 --> 21:05.568
- All right, well,
I'm gonna finish packing,

21:05.612 --> 21:07.744
but I wanted to tell you about

21:07.788 --> 21:10.530
my sit-down that I had
with Mama Gina.

21:10.573 --> 21:12.619
- Who? Mama Gina?

21:12.662 --> 21:14.142
What? Y'all had lunch
or somethin'?

21:15.143 --> 21:16.753
- You remember how
we were at the cookout,

21:16.797 --> 21:18.799
and then everybody
brought up the trip.

21:18.842 --> 21:19.887
- A little awkward.

21:19.930 --> 21:21.758
- Yeah, and remember
I was like,

21:21.802 --> 21:23.673
oh, yeah, Mama Gina,
you should come, too.

21:23.717 --> 21:25.109
- Mm-hmm.

21:25.153 --> 21:27.851
- But then as I started
talking about the cookout,

21:27.895 --> 21:30.506
then it-- the conversation
just started going to the left.

21:30.550 --> 21:32.813
- Uh-uh.
- Yeah.

21:32.856 --> 21:34.423
- I don't know if I should
do this trip or not.

21:34.467 --> 21:35.685
I don't know.

21:35.729 --> 21:37.644
I don't know if that's
a good idea or not.

21:39.123 --> 21:40.647
- What happened?
- Oh, it didn't go too well.

21:40.690 --> 21:42.431
- What happened?

21:42.475 --> 21:45.260
- She then says to me

21:45.304 --> 21:47.958
that I cheated on Dennis,

21:48.002 --> 21:50.831
and she said you told her.

21:50.874 --> 21:52.354
- I told her what?

21:52.398 --> 21:53.703
- What-what you ask?

21:53.747 --> 21:56.140
- I asked her if she
had ever cheated on you.

21:56.184 --> 21:57.838
- What? Why would you
ask her that?

21:57.881 --> 21:58.839
- How do you know?
- Why are y'all so stuck

21:58.882 --> 22:00.057
in the-in the past?

22:00.101 --> 22:01.450
- Well, I ain't stuck
in the past.

22:01.494 --> 22:03.800
I just want some answers
about her cheating on you.

22:03.844 --> 22:05.367
She probably did.

22:05.411 --> 22:08.631
- She said, "Your mother said
that you cheated Dennis."

22:08.675 --> 22:10.372
She, uh, said,
"She admitted it."

22:10.416 --> 22:11.721
- Oh, my God,

22:11.765 --> 22:12.635
you know, I'm not gonna
even gonna swear to God,

22:12.679 --> 22:13.984
but that's a lie,

22:14.028 --> 22:15.290
and I'll tell it to her
to face. That's a lie.

22:17.031 --> 22:18.946
- The conversation
that I had with Diane

22:18.989 --> 22:20.730
when I was at the house--
- What was that conversation?

22:20.774 --> 22:22.645
- Okay, when she said
that there were-- oh,

22:22.689 --> 22:24.212
there was this situation

22:24.255 --> 22:26.170
and this event
with this young man.

22:26.214 --> 22:27.346
- Why you ain't never said
nothin' about it then?

22:27.389 --> 22:28.521
Why you didn't?

22:28.564 --> 22:29.652
- You all broke up.
There was no need.

22:29.696 --> 22:32.220
- That's very
important information.

22:32.263 --> 22:34.222
If Diane can sit down
with you and say,

22:34.265 --> 22:36.572
"Okay, we know Dennis
was cheatin',

22:36.616 --> 22:38.052
but Porsha was cheat--
cheating, too."

22:38.095 --> 22:41.098
- They act like she's
so innocent when she's not.

22:41.142 --> 22:42.404
She ain't innocent.
We all know that.

22:42.448 --> 22:43.884
- Well, we gotta get to
the bottom line then

22:43.927 --> 22:47.931
because if Diane said--
Diane knows, if she told you.

22:47.975 --> 22:50.194
Porsha was not a saint,
and we were still together.

22:50.238 --> 22:53.372
That's all I'm gonna say.
That's all I'm gonna say.

22:53.415 --> 22:55.548
- I can't believe
she lied on me like that.

22:55.591 --> 22:59.421
- My whole thing is,
if we are gonna be
building this family

22:59.465 --> 23:00.944
for togetherness--
- Mm-hmm.

23:00.988 --> 23:04.383
- Then you have to want
to have togetherness.

23:04.426 --> 23:06.863
- You got a crystal
that wards off fake people?

23:06.907 --> 23:08.517
- Oh, man.
- We actually do.

23:08.561 --> 23:10.911
Yes, it's right here.

23:10.954 --> 23:12.347
- Oh, yeah, give me that one.
- And it's called Bronzite.

23:12.391 --> 23:14.001
We use this a lot.

23:14.044 --> 23:14.784
- How many of them you gon' buy?
How many of them you gon' buy?

23:14.828 --> 23:15.959
- There you go. It's--

23:16.003 --> 23:17.439
- I need one
for each one of them.

23:17.483 --> 23:19.267
- Okay.

23:19.310 --> 23:20.747
- I'll be sure to
put these in my, uh,

23:20.790 --> 23:21.878
suitcase first,
so I don't forget 'em.

23:21.922 --> 23:24.403
- Okay, who you
buying them for?

23:24.446 --> 23:27.057
- Porsha.
- Oh, God.

23:27.101 --> 23:30.496
When you come to this trip,
focus on what's important.

23:30.539 --> 23:31.845
- To who?

23:31.888 --> 23:33.890
- To you.
- Okay.

23:33.934 --> 23:35.588
- Well, what's important
to PJ.

23:35.631 --> 23:37.416
- That just really
concerns me, Porsha,

23:37.459 --> 23:38.591
and I don't know
how I feel

23:38.634 --> 23:39.940
about going on this trip
if she's going.

23:39.983 --> 23:41.637
- Well, I don't blame you.

23:41.681 --> 23:43.334
- This trip can be
the best thing

23:43.378 --> 23:45.467
for our entire family,

23:45.511 --> 23:48.818
or it can be
a complete fiasco.

23:48.862 --> 23:50.733
Ooh, girl.

23:50.777 --> 23:52.431
- Coming up next...

23:52.474 --> 23:53.606
- You started this.

23:53.649 --> 23:54.911
- I didn't start sh--.
- Yes, you did,

23:54.955 --> 23:56.391
talking about
come get a robe.

23:56.435 --> 23:58.306
- We're not gonna get anywhere
talking about a robe!

23:58.349 --> 24:00.047
- Yo, waiter!

24:00.090 --> 24:01.788
- If anyone says,
"Robe," again, go home!

24:07.663 --> 24:09.491
- You ready
to go to Mexico?

24:09.535 --> 24:12.189
- You ready?
- Say, "Mexico."

24:12.233 --> 24:13.887
- All right.

24:13.930 --> 24:15.889
You are here.

24:15.932 --> 24:18.282
- Oh, my God, I think
I packed up my entire house.

24:22.504 --> 24:24.114
- Hi.
- Hi.

24:24.158 --> 24:25.464
- Welcome.

24:25.507 --> 24:27.857
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you, too.

24:27.901 --> 24:29.032
Muah.
- Muah.

24:29.076 --> 24:31.165
- You ready for this journey?
- I am.

24:31.208 --> 24:33.733
- I was really glad
to meet Mama Gina.

24:33.776 --> 24:35.038
We can be friends.

24:35.082 --> 24:36.910
We're about the closest
in age on this trip

24:36.953 --> 24:38.085
other than Simon.

24:42.611 --> 24:44.265
All right.
Here we go.

24:44.308 --> 24:45.527
- I need to get a cup, right?

24:45.571 --> 24:46.702
- Yeah, 'cause we're
fixin' to get lit

24:46.746 --> 24:50.097
before we go to
Mexico, girl.

24:50.140 --> 24:53.056
- ♪ Mexico

24:53.100 --> 24:54.580
Okay, there we go.

24:54.623 --> 24:56.538
- What's up with that bag?

24:56.582 --> 24:58.932
- It's got a robe in it.

24:58.975 --> 25:01.064
- Okay.
- Yes.

25:01.108 --> 25:03.545
- Viva la Mexico.

25:03.589 --> 25:06.156
- Better?
- Here's Mr. Teddy.

25:06.200 --> 25:08.463
Take Mr. Teddy.
- Oh, look at that.

25:08.507 --> 25:09.682
- Where is Diane?

25:09.725 --> 25:11.553
- So, y'all, you see mommy
isn't with us.

25:11.597 --> 25:12.772
- Yes.
- So, she woke up,

25:12.815 --> 25:15.165
and she said she literally
could not move.

25:15.209 --> 25:16.950
She was in so much pain.
- Oh.

25:16.993 --> 25:21.563
- My mom had all the plans
to give Mama Gina all the smoke.

25:21.607 --> 25:25.524
So, this might actually be
a good thing for the group

25:25.567 --> 25:27.438
but bad for me
'cause I want my mommy.

25:27.482 --> 25:30.050
- Yo.

25:30.093 --> 25:31.747
- Hey, where are you?

25:33.749 --> 25:36.404
- You gonna be at
the airport in time?

25:38.406 --> 25:39.973
- Yes, for Mexico.

25:41.191 --> 25:43.193
- Yes, I have a present
for you.

25:43.237 --> 25:45.369
So, I'll see you later
today, Dennis.

25:46.675 --> 25:47.763
- Okay.

25:47.807 --> 25:49.025
If Dennis doesn't
come on the trip,

25:49.069 --> 25:50.461
the robe is mine,

25:50.505 --> 25:52.986
and I'm wearing it
every day.

25:53.900 --> 25:55.641
- How are you? Hey!
- Hey, Mama Gina.

25:55.684 --> 25:57.294
- How are you?
- I'm good. I'm good.

25:57.338 --> 25:59.906
- Good. Oh.
- You see Mama Gina?

26:02.865 --> 26:04.824
One, two. One...
- You ready to go on the trip?

26:09.872 --> 26:11.700
- I ultimately decided
last minute to come

26:11.744 --> 26:14.616
because, you know,
I knew Mama Gina was going.

26:14.660 --> 26:17.358
I didn't want her to be
there alone

26:17.401 --> 26:18.620
with all those
crazy folk.

26:18.664 --> 26:21.362
It was either come
or fly in later

26:21.405 --> 26:22.581
to save the day.

26:38.118 --> 26:40.163
- Mexico, Mexico, Mexico.

26:40.207 --> 26:43.558
- I was glad that you came.
- Thank you, Auntie.

26:43.602 --> 26:45.865
- 'Cause I want you to
hold your head up high.

26:45.908 --> 26:47.083
- Oh, it's so high, ma'am.
Let me tell you.

26:47.127 --> 26:49.608
- And I want you to walk
through this thing

26:49.651 --> 26:52.567
like it's blessing.
- I-- I'm good.

26:52.611 --> 26:54.569
- Okay, so,
don't say nothin',

26:54.613 --> 26:56.658
but Dom walked by me,
and he was like,

26:56.702 --> 27:00.706
"Why they got me carryin'
Dennis' robe?"

27:00.749 --> 27:02.272
I said, "Wait a minute.

27:02.316 --> 27:03.926
"You talkin' about
the Versace robe?"

27:03.970 --> 27:05.362
- Well, who got it?
'Cause there ain't
that many people.

27:05.406 --> 27:06.712
- We're gonna find out.

27:06.755 --> 27:08.583
I'm sitting on my seat
on the flight,

27:08.627 --> 27:11.673
and Dom walks by,
and he's like,

27:11.717 --> 27:14.197
"I can't believe they got me
carrying your baby daddy robe."

27:14.241 --> 27:15.416
Wait a minute.

27:15.459 --> 27:18.506
Who came in my house
and took a robe out?

27:19.855 --> 27:21.552
- They better not be drunk.

27:21.596 --> 27:25.078
- Lauren! Hi!
- Hi!

27:25.121 --> 27:28.864
- Family retreat!

27:28.908 --> 27:31.258
- Hi, baby. Yes.
- I brought my yoga mat-- Look.

27:31.301 --> 27:32.607
- Yes!

27:32.651 --> 27:34.478
- She's the only one
with a yoga mat.

27:34.522 --> 27:37.307
Look at Aunt Liz.
- How are you?

27:37.351 --> 27:39.614
- Mexico.
- Hey!

27:41.050 --> 27:43.705
- Okay, grab a drink
and come this way, please.

27:43.749 --> 27:46.229
- Yes, mucho, uh, uno.

27:47.753 --> 27:50.494
What's going on?
- I don't know.

27:53.062 --> 27:54.890
- Whoa!

27:57.806 --> 27:59.765
Whoa!

28:07.207 --> 28:10.950
We got the Mayan dancers.
This feels so authentic.

28:10.993 --> 28:13.126
Like, they're already
bringin' in the holy ghosts.

28:13.169 --> 28:14.693
Like...

28:14.736 --> 28:17.173
I'm ready.
Save me!

28:19.045 --> 28:20.481
- Oh, cleanse me good.

28:20.524 --> 28:22.178
- Yeah, you need
to be cleansed.

28:22.222 --> 28:23.745
We're being cleansed.

28:26.574 --> 28:30.926
- So beautiful.
That is awesome.

28:30.970 --> 28:34.756
Baleigh, hi, boo.

28:34.800 --> 28:37.977
Muah.
- Thank you so much.

28:38.020 --> 28:40.240
- So, I wanted to give everyone
their room assignments.

28:40.283 --> 28:41.502
There's a two-bedroom suite,

28:41.545 --> 28:43.156
and you can stay in there
with Pilar,

28:43.199 --> 28:44.984
and Simon can stay there.
- Oh, good, perfect, perfect.

28:45.027 --> 28:47.813
- Um, Lauren, you'll be
in a suite by yourself.

28:47.856 --> 28:50.163
You two will be in a suite
by yourselves.

28:52.905 --> 28:56.560
I'm in a three-bedroom suite,
and in my suite,

28:56.604 --> 28:59.825
we're gonna have
Londie and Dennis.

28:59.868 --> 29:02.436
Everyone, okay, so,
we have dinner tonight

29:02.479 --> 29:06.222
at the RoMarley Beach House.
It's in a hour and a half.

29:06.266 --> 29:08.703
Go get ready for dinner.

29:08.747 --> 29:11.140
- Is it good?
- It's not that strong.

29:11.184 --> 29:12.838
- It's no liquor in it.
It's a mocktail.

29:12.881 --> 29:14.491
- Oh, it's no liquor in it?

29:14.535 --> 29:15.841
- Can I get an upgrade
on my room, though?

29:15.884 --> 29:18.278
- Wait. Why you-- no.
You're in a room with me.

29:18.321 --> 29:20.149
We're in a suite.

29:20.193 --> 29:21.847
- Why are we sharing a room?
- We can't be a sharing a room.

29:21.890 --> 29:23.718
I'm about to get me
a room right quick.

29:23.762 --> 29:25.154
- The whole hotel
is sold out.

29:25.198 --> 29:26.460
- I'm about to go next door.
- No, you can't leave.

29:26.503 --> 29:27.853
- They got a room, though.
- No, you--

29:27.896 --> 29:30.116
no, you have to stay here.
- Oh, hell no.

29:30.159 --> 29:32.727
I don't know who idea
thought that a grown man

29:32.771 --> 29:34.163
would wanna share a room

29:34.207 --> 29:36.209
with basically
my sister and my cousin.

29:36.252 --> 29:38.124
Who wanna do that?

29:38.167 --> 29:39.473
I don't wanna do that.

29:39.516 --> 29:41.257
- How about we go see it,
and then you can decide?

29:41.301 --> 29:45.871
- Yes Ma'am.

29:45.914 --> 29:47.350
- Ahh!

29:49.788 --> 29:51.354
- Ooh, it feels good in here.

29:51.398 --> 29:53.226
Oh, this is cute.

29:53.269 --> 29:55.445
Sissy hooked us up.

29:55.489 --> 29:58.013
Oh, I love it.
- Ooh.

29:58.057 --> 29:59.362
- Hey, you guys ready?
- I think so.

29:59.406 --> 30:01.147
- We have the best room,
you guys.

30:01.190 --> 30:03.889
- Okay, okay.

30:03.932 --> 30:05.194
- All right, Londie.
That's gonna be your room.

30:05.238 --> 30:07.457
- Maybe-- maybe.
- So, go check out your room.

30:07.501 --> 30:09.155
Dennis, you're this way.
- Oh!

30:09.198 --> 30:12.245
- This is yours.
- Okay, I'm staying.

30:12.288 --> 30:13.507
- You got a patio.

30:13.550 --> 30:14.900
- I'm definitely about
to get my own room.

30:14.943 --> 30:16.597
It's like Lauren
is spying on me, man.

30:16.640 --> 30:19.034
She wanna, like,
watch my moves or somethin'.

30:19.078 --> 30:20.688
Like, why does she want me
to stay next to her?

30:20.731 --> 30:21.907
That's very weird.

30:21.950 --> 30:23.299
Like, she's probably
workin' for Porsha.

30:23.343 --> 30:26.259
- I feel like this is the
only place for Dennis to go.

30:26.302 --> 30:29.131
I don't want him bringing in
dates and not telling me.

30:29.175 --> 30:31.090
So, I'm gonna keep an eye
on Dennis,

30:31.133 --> 30:33.701
right here, next to me,
outside my door,

30:33.744 --> 30:35.224
and maybe we'll bond
a little bit.

30:35.268 --> 30:37.226
- Let me see what
your room look like.

30:37.270 --> 30:38.662
- Mine starts over here.

30:40.490 --> 30:41.361
- Of course,
I took the best room.

30:41.404 --> 30:42.928
It's me.

30:42.971 --> 30:45.234
- Oh, hell no! Oh, hello no.
- I'm planning.

30:45.278 --> 30:46.366
- What is this?
- Don't go up there.

30:46.409 --> 30:47.628
You don't need
to go up there.

30:47.671 --> 30:50.283
- Oh, hell no, fam.
- No, no, no, no, no.

30:50.326 --> 30:51.893
- Hell no!

30:51.937 --> 30:53.199
- You don't need
to go up there.

30:53.242 --> 30:55.636
- What!

30:55.679 --> 30:57.203
- Oh, hell no!

30:57.246 --> 30:59.640
- I have to be able
to recollect myself

30:59.683 --> 31:01.772
after giving you
all my energy all day long.

31:04.340 --> 31:05.951
- I'm not having this sh--.
- I'm not trying

31:05.994 --> 31:08.649
to take the best room--
We'll do dinner here
one night.

31:08.692 --> 31:10.085
- I can't believe this sh--.

31:10.129 --> 31:11.913
- All of my work that I've done,
is going into this.

31:11.957 --> 31:14.046
I feel like
I deserve this.

31:14.698 --> 31:15.656
Oh, my God, no.

31:15.699 --> 31:17.353
Oh, my God.
Dennis, oh!

31:17.397 --> 31:20.748
Dennis!
Dennis, no!

31:25.535 --> 31:26.362
- Wow.

31:28.669 --> 31:30.976
- Ugh!

31:31.019 --> 31:33.065
- Yo, this sh-- lit.
She fooled us, man.

31:33.108 --> 31:34.893
- Holy
- Don't tell nobody.

31:34.936 --> 31:35.981
- Your room lit as

31:36.024 --> 31:37.547
- All right.
I'm going to get dressed.

31:42.552 --> 31:44.250
- What up?

31:45.251 --> 31:47.731
- What's up?
Don't miss that flight
in the morning.

31:49.124 --> 31:51.126
- You put something sexy
in your bag?

31:52.911 --> 31:55.783
- Did you put something sexy
in your bag?

31:58.481 --> 32:00.831
- I said did you put something
sexy in your bag?

32:03.791 --> 32:05.749
Damn.

32:06.750 --> 32:07.969
- Coming up...

32:08.013 --> 32:09.536
- She has no idea
what's going on.

32:09.579 --> 32:10.754
She doesn't need to
be involved.

32:10.798 --> 32:12.582
- She does. I told her.
- Stay out of it.

32:12.626 --> 32:13.888
- What are you gonna do?

32:22.331 --> 32:24.333
- This is like
a freaking family reunion.

32:24.377 --> 32:25.682
- It really is, right?

32:25.726 --> 32:27.597
- Everybody I've met
in your family, so far,

32:27.641 --> 32:28.947
I love every single
one of them.

32:28.990 --> 32:30.557
- They're everything.
They all love you, too.

32:30.600 --> 32:32.428
- We didn't only come here
with family.

32:32.472 --> 32:34.039
We came here
with other people.

32:34.082 --> 32:35.562
- Who are the other people?

32:35.605 --> 32:38.260
- Pilar's dad--
Pilar's grandmother.

32:38.304 --> 32:40.262
- They may be other people
for now, right?

32:40.306 --> 32:42.612
- Mm-hmm.
- However,

32:42.656 --> 32:46.529
the goal is for them
to be our people.

32:46.573 --> 32:48.009
- Okay.

32:48.053 --> 32:51.360
- Even though my goal is for
Pilar to be able to enjoy

32:51.404 --> 32:53.536
her stepfather
and her father,

32:53.580 --> 32:55.147
I do want you to be honest
with me...

32:55.190 --> 32:56.278
- Right.

32:56.322 --> 32:57.714
- ...about your feelings
along the way.

32:57.758 --> 33:02.458
- Uh, I'm still a man
that expects respect.

33:02.502 --> 33:04.069
- You think that's
been upheld?

33:04.112 --> 33:05.853
- So far, for the most part.

33:05.896 --> 33:07.072
- For some reason,

33:07.115 --> 33:08.638
I have a really good
feeling about this.

33:08.682 --> 33:09.639
- I think so, too.

33:15.297 --> 33:17.430
- Go get dressed.
We have dinner.

33:17.473 --> 33:18.344
- Five second twerk?

33:18.387 --> 33:21.477
- No. Go get dressed.

33:38.277 --> 33:40.061
- This is so pretty
how they set it up.

33:40.105 --> 33:41.932
This is so pretty.
- It's gorgeous.

33:41.976 --> 33:44.413
- I wanted Lena
on this retreat more for me

33:44.457 --> 33:47.416
than for the family,
because dealing with them, I--

33:47.460 --> 33:49.331
I do get weak sometimes,

33:49.375 --> 33:50.854
and I kinda need
her to hold me up.

33:50.898 --> 33:51.768
Hey.
- Hi.

33:51.812 --> 33:53.074
- Hey.
- Welcome, welcome.

33:53.118 --> 33:54.858
- Oh, it's so pretty.

33:54.902 --> 33:56.077
- Hey.

33:56.121 --> 33:58.514
- Aww, look at
you all prepared.

33:58.558 --> 34:00.560
- I'm prepared. I'm ready.
- Aww.

34:01.735 --> 34:03.606
- Hello, hello.
I love the coral.

34:03.650 --> 34:07.436
- Thank you.
- Hey, boo.

34:09.830 --> 34:12.528
- Hey, Dennis.

34:12.572 --> 34:15.053
- Hey, Miss Gina.
- Hello.

34:15.096 --> 34:17.794
- Hi, family.
- Hi.

34:17.838 --> 34:19.970
- Hello.

34:20.014 --> 34:22.190
- Hey, goddess.
- Hi.

34:22.234 --> 34:24.366
- So, it's gonna be
a set menu.

34:24.410 --> 34:26.499
The courses are
just gonna come out.

34:26.542 --> 34:28.109
- It's life family style.

34:28.153 --> 34:30.285
- Thank you guys
so much for coming.

34:30.329 --> 34:32.070
I want you guys to know
that this is something

34:32.113 --> 34:33.636
that you're doing
for yourselves.

34:33.680 --> 34:36.857
I know this week is gonna be
about self-transformation,

34:36.900 --> 34:40.382
and we can't do that without
detaching from our thoughts,

34:40.426 --> 34:43.559
and Lena is going to do
a ritual for us.

34:43.603 --> 34:45.474
- We're gonna do
a short meditation.

34:45.518 --> 34:46.910
We're gonna
clear our energy,

34:46.954 --> 34:48.695
and you're gonna begin
to cultivate self-awareness.

34:48.738 --> 34:50.740
So, stand on up.

34:52.481 --> 34:54.353
So, this is Florida water,

34:54.396 --> 34:58.270
and it's used by healers
for ceremony and ritual.

34:58.313 --> 35:00.272
So, I'm gonna
put some in your palm.

35:00.315 --> 35:02.317
You're gonna clap
three times

35:02.361 --> 35:05.233
and then come over
your third eye.

35:07.801 --> 35:09.585
- I don't even know what
to make of this situation.

35:11.674 --> 35:14.721
- So, rub your palms together.
Clap three times.

35:18.028 --> 35:19.595
- I'm cleansing myself.

35:21.206 --> 35:23.251
Over your third eye.
Uh-huh.

35:23.295 --> 35:25.035
All the way over,
three times. Uh-huh.

35:25.079 --> 35:26.124
Smell it.
Take it in.

35:26.167 --> 35:27.429
Stop going so fast.
- It stinks.

35:27.473 --> 35:29.301
- Smell it.
- It does not stink.

35:29.344 --> 35:30.606
- She called it
Florida water, man.

35:30.650 --> 35:32.608
It really smell like
my granddaddy cologne,

35:32.652 --> 35:34.349
is what it really smell like.
She ain't fooling me.

35:34.393 --> 35:36.177
I was gonna take some.

35:36.221 --> 35:37.657
Throw a little bit
on Porsha.

35:37.700 --> 35:39.267
Throw a little bit
on Storm.

35:39.311 --> 35:40.442
- Over your face.
Over your back.

35:40.486 --> 35:42.140
- That's right.

35:42.183 --> 35:46.361
- Uh, this is too much.

35:46.405 --> 35:47.623
- All right.

35:47.667 --> 35:48.842
So, we're gonna come
into a short meditation.

35:51.975 --> 35:55.805
We have the power
to choose our thoughts.

35:59.940 --> 36:01.985
Relaxing with the exhale.

36:04.118 --> 36:08.862
There's something powerful
about speaking your intention.

36:08.905 --> 36:10.646
Okay, so, we're gonna
go around and share.

36:10.690 --> 36:13.301
What are you pulling
into your life?

36:13.345 --> 36:15.129
- Maybe I can say
joyful abundance.

36:15.173 --> 36:17.175
- I would like to cultivate
some relationships

36:17.218 --> 36:18.654
that's actually real.

36:18.698 --> 36:21.091
- Abundance and prosperity
is always my intention.

36:21.135 --> 36:23.485
I've been manifesting that
for, like, a year and a half.

36:23.529 --> 36:26.619
- My first intention
would be good health.

36:26.662 --> 36:28.360
You know,
I'm very blessed,

36:28.403 --> 36:29.404
and I wanna continue
to have good health.

36:29.448 --> 36:31.841
- I wanted to bond
with the family.

36:31.885 --> 36:34.366
- When we were meditating
just now--
- Uh-huh.

36:34.409 --> 36:38.457
- I think that
my spirit was so smoky.

36:38.500 --> 36:40.850
So, I couldn't
see anything.

36:42.678 --> 36:44.680
Because I feel like
my intention

36:44.724 --> 36:46.508
was to come
to the trip in truth,

36:46.552 --> 36:48.336
and I haven't dealt
with it yet.

36:48.380 --> 36:50.382
- Okay.
- First things first.

36:50.425 --> 36:52.862
Dom is carrying
around a robe.

36:52.906 --> 36:54.908
- Sh--.

36:54.951 --> 36:58.694
- And it seems
like something secret,

36:58.738 --> 37:02.002
and Dom walked by,
and he said,

37:02.045 --> 37:04.352
"Oh, they got me carrying
your baby daddy's robe."

37:04.396 --> 37:06.746
- Oh, my God.

37:08.835 --> 37:12.012
- Don't blame Dom.
- Why?

37:12.055 --> 37:13.970
- Because Dennis was threatening
not to come on the trip.

37:14.014 --> 37:15.407
He told Londie that he
had things that he wanted.

37:15.450 --> 37:17.017
- I want my robe.
- And so, we said,

37:17.060 --> 37:19.149
"Okay, if we get it,
will you come on the trip?"

37:19.193 --> 37:20.542
He said, "Yes."

37:20.586 --> 37:22.544
- You can't take nothing
outta my house for Dennis.

37:22.588 --> 37:24.590
- He said it was his.
- No, you cannot do that.

37:24.633 --> 37:26.983
- We didn't think you were
gonna figure it out that way.

37:29.551 --> 37:31.031
- Here's my thing.

37:31.074 --> 37:33.599
If Dennis is not in a place
where he wants to be here,

37:33.642 --> 37:35.122
genuinely, to create the family
we want for Pilar...

37:35.165 --> 37:36.906
Aah, here you go.

37:36.950 --> 37:39.822
- then maybe you shouldn't
have given him the robe.

37:39.866 --> 37:41.433
- Oh, girl.

37:46.438 --> 37:49.179
- If Dennis is not in a place
where he wants to be here,

37:49.223 --> 37:52.182
genuinely, and do
the hard work to create

37:52.226 --> 37:54.097
the family we want
for Pilar,

37:54.141 --> 37:56.665
then maybe you shouldn't
have given him the robe.

37:56.709 --> 37:57.840
Like, it's not--
- I haven't even
got my robe back.

37:57.884 --> 37:58.885
it's not a joke.

37:58.928 --> 38:00.930
This isn't a game.
- What game?

38:00.974 --> 38:02.236
- I don't care
if Porsha is upset.

38:02.280 --> 38:05.326
She wanted Dennis to come.
We figured it out.

38:05.370 --> 38:06.458
Yay for us.

38:06.501 --> 38:07.328
And it wasn't your robe.
It's his robe.

38:07.372 --> 38:08.677
Give it back.

38:08.721 --> 38:11.158
- I'm here because we
all have a common goal.

38:11.201 --> 38:13.769
That's what I thought.
Now, if I am wrong, tell me.

38:13.813 --> 38:16.206
I don't know about y'all.
It's gonna really tick me off

38:16.250 --> 38:18.818
and trigger me
if it is about games,

38:18.861 --> 38:20.254
because I have
taken this serious.

38:20.298 --> 38:21.951
Y'all done
locked in, okay?

38:21.995 --> 38:23.997
I've locked into
what you want us to do

38:24.040 --> 38:26.260
because I'm in a very
uncomfortable position.

38:26.304 --> 38:28.306
That-that just really
triggered me to find out,

38:28.349 --> 38:30.525
like, oh, he needed a robe
in order to come on the trip.

38:30.569 --> 38:32.832
Like, clearly--
- What was the trigger about?

38:32.875 --> 38:34.529
What's the root
of the anger?

38:34.573 --> 38:36.096
- She's not in control.
That's the trigger.

38:36.139 --> 38:38.141
- Well, one is
going behind my back,

38:38.185 --> 38:40.840
so you can come
on the trip when clearly,

38:40.883 --> 38:42.363
is it really about a robe?
- That's not what happened.

38:42.407 --> 38:43.843
- Or are you just trying to,
like, pull-- pull strings?

38:43.886 --> 38:46.149
- But that's not
what happened.

38:46.193 --> 38:47.586
- Well, then what happened?

38:47.629 --> 38:49.979
- So, the barbecue was
extremely awkward.

38:50.023 --> 38:51.372
- We invited him.

38:51.416 --> 38:53.331
- We thought, for everyone
to get on the same page,

38:53.374 --> 38:55.811
that Dennis and Simon
should come.

38:55.855 --> 38:57.117
I made a deal with him.

38:57.160 --> 38:58.988
We get the robe.
He'll come.

38:59.032 --> 39:00.425
He's here.
- I guess my thing is,

39:00.468 --> 39:02.340
at what point-- what point
is it not a game, though?

39:02.383 --> 39:03.384
- And literally,
it was one robe,

39:03.428 --> 39:04.429
and we would have
told you later.

39:04.472 --> 39:05.908
- At what point
is it not a game?

39:05.952 --> 39:08.215
- The barbecue was a game.
- What do you mean a game?

39:08.258 --> 39:09.956
- It was really, really weird.
It was super weird.

39:09.999 --> 39:11.610
- Yeah, it was weird.

39:11.653 --> 39:14.090
Dennis, I thought we was gonna
meet your new girlfriend today.

39:14.134 --> 39:16.354
- I ain't got no girlfriend.
I don't.

39:16.397 --> 39:17.877
- He got a piece.

39:19.182 --> 39:21.402
- How we wanted it
to go for you and Porsha,

39:21.446 --> 39:24.362
it maybe wasn't what you and
her wanted at the time.

39:24.405 --> 39:27.234
So, now it may be too late.
I guess it too late.

39:27.277 --> 39:29.149
- Uh, I think
it's too late.

39:29.192 --> 39:31.412
- And if I were him,
or I were Mama Gina,

39:31.456 --> 39:33.371
I wouldn't come
around again.

39:33.414 --> 39:35.155
- I think it's ridiculous
to think that I would come

39:35.198 --> 39:37.549
all the way to Mexico
to get a robe back.

39:37.592 --> 39:39.115
I came because the trip
was important.

39:39.159 --> 39:40.421
Porsha is overreacting.

39:40.465 --> 39:43.424
Like, it's my robe.
I don't get it.

39:43.468 --> 39:45.383
- The barbecue was emotional.
- It was weird.

39:46.862 --> 39:47.863
- Girl, sit down.

39:47.907 --> 39:51.084
- If I were you,
or if I were him,

39:51.127 --> 39:53.086
I would not have
come around again.

39:53.129 --> 39:55.349
- I don't understand
what your issue is.

39:55.393 --> 39:56.568
- What do you care
about this robe?

39:56.611 --> 39:58.352
- Yeah, give me my robe.
- Yeah, because--

39:58.396 --> 39:59.353
because it's about
the intention.
- It's the principle.

39:59.397 --> 40:00.572
It's the principle of it.
- Hey!

40:00.615 --> 40:02.182
- Storm, you don't
know what's going on.

40:02.225 --> 40:03.444
Stay out of it.
- Okay.

40:03.488 --> 40:05.011
- It don't matter.
What does that matter?

40:06.926 --> 40:08.449
- Can you confirm
she's not Porsha?

40:08.493 --> 40:10.059
She wanna be Porsha.
She's not Porsha.

40:10.103 --> 40:12.192
I knew Storm before
I-I knew Porsha.

40:12.235 --> 40:15.021
She was a host, you know,
in one of my restaurants,

40:15.064 --> 40:16.588
and she got fired,

40:16.631 --> 40:19.808
because of just
poor work performance.

40:19.852 --> 40:22.637
- It was very hard for me
to work in his establishment

40:22.681 --> 40:26.380
just because he's just
a flirtatious person, period,

40:26.424 --> 40:28.121
and I used to tell him
all the time, like, don't--

40:28.164 --> 40:30.036
don't do that over here.
You're dating my cousin.

40:30.079 --> 40:31.516
- Ultimately,
it was hate from her.

40:31.559 --> 40:33.039
Like, "Oh, you're
dating Dennis.

40:33.082 --> 40:34.693
"He fired me.
Blah-blah-blah."

40:34.736 --> 40:37.913
She, you know, told Porsha
I was liking her,

40:37.957 --> 40:39.175
and then it came out
she was lying.

40:39.219 --> 40:41.047
It's like, oh, now you
gotta cut Storm off.

40:41.090 --> 40:43.963
- He old.
I don't do that old.

40:44.006 --> 40:45.486
- Ain't nobody had
to do no robe or nothin'

40:45.530 --> 40:47.009
for me to come.
- Porsha, if we was able

40:47.053 --> 40:48.315
to discuss it with you--
if we were able to discuss it--

40:48.358 --> 40:49.534
- I just came because
I naturally want this.

40:49.577 --> 40:50.099
- But, Porsha, we know
he's playing game.

40:50.143 --> 40:51.274
We know that.

40:51.318 --> 40:53.146
That's what we're trying to fix.
- Okay, thank you.

40:53.189 --> 40:54.408
- Who? Who playing games?
- So, validate that part
of what I'm saying.

40:54.452 --> 40:55.714
- I am. I'm trying.
You won't let me talk.

40:55.757 --> 40:57.063
- This sh-- is stupid.
- Give him his robe back.

40:57.106 --> 40:58.760
- All this is stupid.

40:58.804 --> 41:01.459
- Stop talking when you
don't know what's going on.

41:01.502 --> 41:03.243
- Or what? Or what?
What are you gonna do?

41:03.286 --> 41:04.505
- You don't know what--
- What are you gonna do?

41:04.549 --> 41:06.507
She already told me
what's going on.

41:06.551 --> 41:08.596
- I explained it to her,
what happened.

41:08.640 --> 41:10.206
- Keep talking about somethin'
you don't know anything about.

41:10.250 --> 41:11.643
- Waiter! Waiter!
- She does know,

41:11.686 --> 41:13.079
because I told her
what happened.
- She doesn't.

41:13.122 --> 41:16.038
- Porsha is upset
about a robe.

41:16.082 --> 41:17.736
That's Dennis' robe.

41:17.779 --> 41:19.781
This is how you're gonna
start out this trip,

41:19.825 --> 41:21.391
with this triviality?

41:21.435 --> 41:23.785
I thought you guys were gonna
go on a higher level now.

41:23.829 --> 41:27.267
They seem like children
to me, spiritually.

41:27.310 --> 41:28.834
- You don't even
know my side, Londie.

41:28.877 --> 41:30.183
- You just told me.

41:30.226 --> 41:31.619
I just listened to
your entire side.

41:31.663 --> 41:33.273
- Waiter!
- Londie.

41:33.316 --> 41:35.275
- She has no idea
what's going on.

41:35.318 --> 41:36.450
She doesn't gotta be involved.
- She does.

41:36.494 --> 41:39.018
I told her everything.
- You don't know.

41:39.061 --> 41:41.673
Stay out of it.
- What are you gonna do?

41:41.716 --> 41:45.677
- Oh, no, you're not
standing up. Girl, bye.

41:45.720 --> 41:46.982
- Let's just save this.

41:47.026 --> 41:48.375
- No, because it's just
so much to be said.

41:48.418 --> 41:49.594
It's a lotta undercover stuff
that's going on.

41:49.637 --> 41:50.899
- Stop talking.
Stop talking.

41:53.511 --> 41:55.121
- This is what you get?
You started this.

41:55.164 --> 41:56.601
- I didn't start sh--.
- Yes, you did,

41:56.644 --> 41:58.472
by going behind people's back.
- I didn't wanna come.

41:58.516 --> 42:00.474
I was asked to come.
- Talking about come
get a robe.

42:00.518 --> 42:02.824
- We're not gonna get anywhere
talking about a robe!

42:02.868 --> 42:04.391
- Yo, waiter!

42:05.914 --> 42:07.481
- Stop talking about the robe!
- I need a waiter.

42:07.525 --> 42:09.439
- Stop talking about--
if anyone says, "Robe," again,

42:09.483 --> 42:11.267
go home.

42:11.311 --> 42:13.008
It's not about the robe.

42:16.838 --> 42:19.667
Next time, on
"Porsha's Family Matters"...

42:22.191 --> 42:23.366
- Let it out.
That's it. Good.

42:25.064 --> 42:26.848
- I didn't wanna
sit around for four days

42:26.892 --> 42:29.634
twiddling my thumbs.
So, if you could, man,

42:29.677 --> 42:31.810
let her know I'm bringing
a date, you know?

42:31.853 --> 42:34.856
- So, remember last night
when Dennis did the whole,

42:34.900 --> 42:36.205
"I'm ready to trade rooms."

42:36.249 --> 42:38.120
And then he said today
a girl was coming.

42:41.254 --> 42:44.387
Porsha is going to start
sharpening her knives.

42:54.528 --> 42:56.138
- Dennis brought a girl.
