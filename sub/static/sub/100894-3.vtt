Alice, you are gonna love
those chicken dumplings,

01:12.739 --> 01:15.075
they have got a little extra kick today.

01:15.158 --> 01:16.117
[chuckles]

01:16.201 --> 01:18.703
Hello! Table for one,
or are you waiting on folks?

01:18.787 --> 01:21.039
I'm supposed to ask for Dana Sue Sullivan.

01:21.122 --> 01:23.583
Oh, well, that is me, sweetheart.
What can I do for you?

01:24.375 --> 01:25.543
You've been served.

01:31.716 --> 01:33.218
[clapping]

01:35.011 --> 01:38.556
I knew you were gonna look like a cat
stuck in a swing when you got those,

01:38.640 --> 01:40.558
but it was better than I even dreamed.

01:40.642 --> 01:42.310
You're suing me?

01:48.358 --> 01:49.984
Wrongful termination?

01:50.068 --> 01:50.944
Yeah.

01:51.444 --> 01:54.781
Now, everyone in South Carolina
is gonna know

01:54.864 --> 01:56.366
what a lousy boss you are.

01:56.866 --> 02:00.036
You take credit for all of my hard work,
and you claim it for yourself.

02:00.120 --> 02:02.872
Now, you and I, we both know
that if it weren't for me,

02:02.956 --> 02:05.083
this place would've folded
the day it opened.

02:05.166 --> 02:06.960
I slaved away in that kitchen,

02:07.043 --> 02:09.963
making this place a success, and, what,
you're gonna kick me to the curb?

02:10.046 --> 02:12.132
-You hog all the glory for yourself?
-Stop it.

02:12.215 --> 02:13.842
I was the genius in this kitchen!

02:13.925 --> 02:16.010
-If it weren't for me, it was gonna-- Hey!
-Get out!

02:16.094 --> 02:17.011
Come on.

02:17.095 --> 02:20.223
-Okay. Okay. Look, I'm gonna ruin you!
-[Erik] Come on. Let's go!

02:20.306 --> 02:22.267
When I'm done with her,
this place is gonna be mine!

02:22.350 --> 02:24.060
-Get out of here!
-Bet she goes crazy.

02:24.644 --> 02:26.229
If you're not careful,
she's gonna ruin you.

02:26.312 --> 02:27.313
[grunts]

02:28.273 --> 02:29.732
Chef asked you to leave!

02:33.319 --> 02:36.072
[boy] All right, boys, great job.
Let's do sit-ups now.

02:38.783 --> 02:39.993
Suck.

02:40.660 --> 02:42.370
-[groans]
-[Cal] Jackson, it's all right.

02:43.121 --> 02:46.875
Think about where you want it to go,
and then let it travel off your fingers.

02:47.709 --> 02:49.002
Hey, Coach Maddox.

02:50.837 --> 02:53.590
How come you got Tyler in the outfield
doing Pilates?

02:54.090 --> 02:55.925
Oh, core work is vital to his game.

02:56.009 --> 02:59.637
His arm is more important than his abs.
He should be exercising that.

02:59.721 --> 03:02.056
-Well, Jackson needs practice too.
-Why?

03:02.515 --> 03:04.225
'Cause of his arm,
or 'cause he's the mayor's son?

03:06.519 --> 03:07.896
What brings you by, Doctor?

03:11.399 --> 03:12.483
[Bill] All right, look.

03:13.067 --> 03:14.694
I'm worried about Tyler.

03:14.777 --> 03:16.362
And I know he's been struggling.

03:16.446 --> 03:20.825
And with the college scouts coming around,
well, he's gotta be in top form.

03:23.870 --> 03:24.704
You talk to him?

03:24.787 --> 03:26.789
He and I aren't talking that well
right now.

03:27.916 --> 03:30.543
Which is why he didn't want me
to meet with you and Maddie.

03:30.627 --> 03:32.003
Okay, well...

03:32.086 --> 03:33.046
[sighs]

03:33.421 --> 03:36.466
...how about you, Ms. Townsend,
and I sit down and we...

03:38.051 --> 03:39.219
develop a plan?

03:39.302 --> 03:42.013
Well, Maddie doesn't know much
about baseball.

03:42.972 --> 03:44.807
Yeah, but she knows a lot about Ty.

03:49.354 --> 03:50.396
Was that Brad?

03:51.022 --> 03:52.398
I mean, I know it was Brad,
I could hear him in here,

03:52.482 --> 03:53.316
but what did he want?

03:53.399 --> 03:56.027
-He didn't ask for you.
-Well, he's not coming back, is he?

03:57.237 --> 03:58.613
This is Chef's restaurant.

03:59.322 --> 04:00.657
It's Chef's decision.

04:00.740 --> 04:02.367
Was he why she put those up?

04:02.450 --> 04:04.035
'Cause it feels
like Big Brother's watching.

04:04.118 --> 04:05.995
Well, and as my mama used to say,

04:06.079 --> 04:08.581
don't do anything you don't want to see
on tomorrow's front page.

04:08.665 --> 04:11.918
-But don't you think that we should--
-I think you need to peel these potatoes.

04:23.638 --> 04:25.056
[Maddie]
So, how long have you been training?

04:25.139 --> 04:27.684
Oh, ten years.
Or that's how long I've been certified.

04:27.767 --> 04:30.228
I was helping friends in high school
and college before that.

04:31.271 --> 04:33.982
Um, now, our clientele is strictly ladies.

04:34.065 --> 04:36.150
Do you have any experience training women?

04:36.234 --> 04:38.319
Oh, men, women, dogs.

04:40.113 --> 04:41.406
I know you think I was joking about that,

04:41.489 --> 04:43.241
but when I lived in DC,
I had this one client,

04:43.324 --> 04:44.325
she had too much money.

04:44.409 --> 04:47.453
She paid me to do training sessions
with her pug, Ernie.

04:47.537 --> 04:49.872
Ernie! That was also the name
of her dead husband,

04:49.956 --> 04:51.582
so it was weird all around.

04:53.126 --> 04:54.752
Uh, Helen.

04:55.336 --> 04:58.214
Uh, sorry. I got bad news. [sighs]

04:59.841 --> 05:00.675
Excuse me.

05:03.011 --> 05:05.972
Skeeter, if you tell me
that there's a nest of copperheads

05:06.055 --> 05:08.308
under this house, I am selling pronto.

05:08.891 --> 05:11.602
Well, it's, uh,
still too cold for copperheads.

05:11.686 --> 05:13.896
Oh, you won't see them
till later this summer.

05:14.314 --> 05:15.315
[laughs]

05:16.024 --> 05:18.401
There could be a nest of copperheads
under this house?

05:18.901 --> 05:22.322
Well, your problem at the moment
is corroded pipes upstairs.

05:22.989 --> 05:24.073
Oh, come on.

05:24.157 --> 05:26.326
Uh, you-- You can't go up there.

05:27.035 --> 05:29.037
Not with those death spikes.

05:30.204 --> 05:33.249
I have been climbing stairs in high heels
since I was nine years old.

05:33.333 --> 05:34.375
Uh-huh.

05:34.459 --> 05:37.253
Those stilts will rip holes
in the drop cloths,

05:37.337 --> 05:40.006
and you'll trip
and break your pretty neck.

05:40.590 --> 05:42.300
Now, my guys can fix the pipe.

05:42.383 --> 05:44.344
It's just gonna take us a little longer.

05:44.427 --> 05:45.720
We'll pay for overtime,

05:45.803 --> 05:48.097
as long as we can still open on schedule.

05:48.181 --> 05:49.015
And, Skeeter,

05:49.599 --> 05:51.392
do whatever you can to make sure

05:51.476 --> 05:54.020
that we don't see any copperheads
around here.

05:55.521 --> 05:56.397
Ever.

05:57.523 --> 05:59.025
[man] What you're doing here is great.

05:59.984 --> 06:00.985
[Maddie] Oh, with the spa?

06:01.069 --> 06:03.738
Yeah! I mean, this whole place
is like your fight song!

06:03.821 --> 06:04.739
Oh. Uh... [chuckles]

06:04.822 --> 06:06.657
As soon as Ashley and I
heard what your ex did,

06:06.741 --> 06:09.035
I mean, we sang our own
find a new doctor song.

06:09.577 --> 06:11.245
Well, Ashley should join.

06:11.329 --> 06:12.372
[phone ringing]

06:12.455 --> 06:14.791
-Oh. Sorry.
-Oh, no, no. Take it.

06:14.874 --> 06:17.126
I've trained enough moms to know
that when that phone rings,

06:17.210 --> 06:18.127
everything else gets dropped.

06:18.211 --> 06:19.796
-Yeah.
-Even weights.

06:19.879 --> 06:21.339
My toe learned that the hard way.

06:22.048 --> 06:22.965
Ooh.

06:24.634 --> 06:26.761
Hey, um, Ty, I am on my way.

06:26.844 --> 06:28.179
Are you close?

06:28.262 --> 06:30.640
Actually, I... I'm leaving now.

06:30.723 --> 06:32.308
Mom, practice ended ten minutes ago.

06:32.392 --> 06:34.685
Oh, well,
I'm just finishing up a work thing.

06:34.769 --> 06:37.605
-Can you get a ride home with Luke?
-No, he already left.

06:37.939 --> 06:39.524
Okay, I'll be there in 15 minutes.

06:39.607 --> 06:40.483
Mom!

06:41.192 --> 06:42.944
Or how about you just walk home?

06:43.027 --> 06:43.986
Fine, I'll walk.

07:03.172 --> 07:05.591
Hey, don't use up all that hot water.

07:05.675 --> 07:08.094
-Kyle and Katie need to take a shower too.
-Okay.

07:12.265 --> 07:14.767
I hope he was more entertaining
on the ride home.

07:15.351 --> 07:16.227
Thanks for that.

07:16.727 --> 07:18.187
Glad to. He was on my way.

07:19.939 --> 07:22.984
So, Dr. Townsend came by practice.

07:23.860 --> 07:24.819
Sorry.

07:24.902 --> 07:26.487
He's worried about Ty's game.

07:27.405 --> 07:30.867
And we decided that the three of us
should have a sit-down.

07:32.076 --> 07:33.327
Tomorrow morning okay?

07:33.953 --> 07:35.621
I know Ty objected before,

07:35.705 --> 07:38.291
but I really think it's important
that it be the three of us.

07:38.374 --> 07:40.293
I understand. I'll be there.

07:41.210 --> 07:42.086
And...

07:42.753 --> 07:44.130
thanks again for getting him home.

07:44.589 --> 07:46.799
NBD, as the kids say.

07:46.883 --> 07:47.842
[both laugh]

07:47.925 --> 07:50.636
Uh, you know, if you need anything,
just holler.

07:51.596 --> 07:53.431
I actually don't live that far away.

07:59.103 --> 08:01.314
-[car door closes]
-[car engine starts]

08:02.940 --> 08:03.774
[knocking at door]

08:06.569 --> 08:08.196
You still working on your paper?

08:08.821 --> 08:09.697
Mm-hmm.

08:12.617 --> 08:14.577
What? You want to study astronomy too?

08:15.244 --> 08:16.537
[chuckles] No.

08:17.038 --> 08:20.041
No. The closest I ever want to get
to space is that roller coaster

08:20.124 --> 08:22.502
you made me ride at Disney World.

08:22.585 --> 08:27.256
I have never prayed so hard
for safe passage in my life, by the way.

08:27.840 --> 08:30.510
Yeah, Dad had to practically carry you off
when it was over.

08:33.429 --> 08:36.140
All right, well, put your paper
on the counter when you're done,

08:36.224 --> 08:38.017
and I'll proof it
before you get up in the morning.

08:38.100 --> 08:40.561
It's Coach Adams.
He doesn't care about typos.

08:40.645 --> 08:42.563
Well, I do, and you should.

08:43.856 --> 08:46.317
Please do not roll your eyes at me,
young lady.

08:46.400 --> 08:49.779
You know you're not allowed
to do things halfway under this roof.

08:53.074 --> 08:54.492
[keyboard clacking]

08:54.575 --> 08:55.576
Okay.

08:57.119 --> 08:58.829
Good night, sweetie.

09:10.508 --> 09:14.136
I want the three of us to figure out
what we can do together to help Ty.

09:14.679 --> 09:16.556
I don't want to have to bench him
this close to regionals.

09:16.639 --> 09:18.432
Well, he's going through a rough time,

09:18.516 --> 09:20.059
and pullin' him
from the startin' line-up now

09:20.142 --> 09:21.477
is only gonna make things worse.

09:21.561 --> 09:23.604
Bill, baseball is not everything.

09:24.355 --> 09:25.815
Ty will get his grades up.

09:25.898 --> 09:27.066
We can get him a tutor.

09:27.149 --> 09:28.234
I've got it covered.

09:28.317 --> 09:30.194
-I can help too.
-By writing checks?

09:30.278 --> 09:32.488
[stammers]
Let's just keep this discussion on Ty.

09:33.322 --> 09:34.156
[Bill sighs]

09:34.240 --> 09:37.076
I think part of what's making
Ty's game suffer...

09:38.869 --> 09:39.704
is you.

09:42.331 --> 09:44.375
When you're both in the stands,
he's distracted.

09:44.458 --> 09:47.795
I think he's worried if you're both
in the same place, you might...

09:49.547 --> 09:51.465
What's the answer? For Ty?

09:52.091 --> 09:53.301
Divide the games.

09:54.510 --> 09:55.928
One of you there at a time.

09:56.929 --> 09:59.181
A baseball custody agreement?

10:00.433 --> 10:01.267
No.

10:01.976 --> 10:05.062
No, I haven't missed a game of his
since T-ball,

10:05.146 --> 10:06.981
and with everything going on here,

10:07.064 --> 10:09.942
he needs to know just how much
I still love and support him.

10:10.026 --> 10:11.152
I'll tell him.

10:16.907 --> 10:18.743
[bell ringing]

10:18.826 --> 10:20.745
He shaves his beard with an ax, you know?

10:21.203 --> 10:23.205
Maybe if I did that,
I could pitch in the majors too.

10:23.289 --> 10:26.459
-Hey, well, you gotta hit puberty first.
-[chuckles] What are you talking about?

10:27.418 --> 10:28.419
Mom.

10:28.919 --> 10:30.129
Hey. What are you doing here?

10:30.212 --> 10:31.172
-Hey, Gabe.
-Hey.

10:31.255 --> 10:33.341
-Can I talk to you?
-Uh, yeah.

10:33.424 --> 10:34.467
Hey, listen.

10:34.550 --> 10:36.427
Um, your dad and I just had a meeting
with Coach Maddox.

10:36.510 --> 10:37.470
Dad's here, too?

10:38.012 --> 10:39.096
-Ty.
-What?

10:39.180 --> 10:41.891
Look, we all think that it would be best

10:41.974 --> 10:44.352
if your dad and I weren't
both at your games.

10:44.977 --> 10:47.229
So... we're gonna take turns,

10:47.855 --> 10:49.190
starting today.

10:49.273 --> 10:50.900
Your dad will be there. I won't.

10:52.193 --> 10:53.611
You're not gonna come see me pitch?

10:54.862 --> 10:55.696
Ty...

10:56.530 --> 10:58.366
Look, your dad and I don't agree
on much right now,

10:58.449 --> 11:00.451
but we agree on this, okay? We love you,

11:01.035 --> 11:04.163
and we support you,
and we want to see you succeed.

11:04.955 --> 11:06.040
So, go out there,

11:06.832 --> 11:08.876
kick Abbington's butt, okay?

11:09.877 --> 11:10.711
Okay.

11:12.713 --> 11:16.258
Sorry you expecting a Christmas party,
'cause this ain't one.

11:16.342 --> 11:17.677
Well, not with that attitude.

11:18.260 --> 11:20.471
Two problems. All right, number one.

11:20.554 --> 11:22.556
Dana Sue's fridge is on back-order.

11:22.640 --> 11:25.768
-Well, did you tell her?
-No. I saw what she did to Ronnie.

11:25.851 --> 11:28.020
I don't want that nuclear reactor
to blow up at me.

11:28.104 --> 11:30.231
Well, then don't marry her,
and then cheat on her.

11:30.314 --> 11:31.482
-What?
-I'll tell her.

11:31.565 --> 11:34.402
-The second problem--
-Is that you have not complimented me

11:34.485 --> 11:36.028
on my brand-new outfit.

11:36.112 --> 11:38.155
Second problem.

11:43.369 --> 11:44.495
Where is the ceiling?

11:45.746 --> 11:47.873
Pipes in the walls upstairs
have been leaking.

11:48.457 --> 11:49.875
Corroded everything.

11:49.959 --> 11:52.044
Soaked down through the walls,

11:52.128 --> 11:55.840
seeped into the floorboards
like deceit in a soul.

11:56.465 --> 11:57.717
How do you fix it?

11:58.175 --> 11:59.885
Well, we replace all the pipe,

12:00.511 --> 12:04.223
rebuild and repaint the wall,
and then we redo the flooring.

12:04.640 --> 12:06.142
Well,
we might as well take this opportunity

12:06.225 --> 12:07.476
to repaint the hallway.

12:07.560 --> 12:09.228
-Hmm.
-I'll have Maddie pick out a color.

12:09.311 --> 12:10.646
How long is this gonna take?

12:10.730 --> 12:13.858
Well, I-- I'll get it done
before your Christmas party.

12:13.941 --> 12:16.360
Skeeter Ramsey,
we're opening in less than a month!

12:16.444 --> 12:19.321
Not unless Santa owes you
a mighty big favor.

12:21.449 --> 12:22.783
How much more is this gonna cost?

12:22.867 --> 12:25.745
Even if my guys work 14-hour shifts,

12:25.828 --> 12:28.748
there's just not enough of 'em
to get it done in time.

12:32.251 --> 12:34.253
[cheering]

12:34.879 --> 12:36.255
Just need one more like that.

12:36.338 --> 12:39.550
Throw 'em out, Ty.
You can do it! You got this!

12:39.633 --> 12:40.843
[man] Let's go, Serenity!

12:40.926 --> 12:42.011
[man 2] Come on, Ty. Here we go.

12:42.970 --> 12:44.221
[Noreen] You got this.

12:50.102 --> 12:51.771
-[umpire] Strike!
-[Bill] Hey.

12:51.854 --> 12:53.314
There you go, son! There you go!

12:53.397 --> 12:55.483
That's it, Ty! Two more like that!

12:55.566 --> 12:57.151
Throw smoke! Throw smoke!

12:57.860 --> 12:59.111
[laughter]

13:00.237 --> 13:02.364
Hey, come on.
Throw strikes, son. Let's go.

13:05.534 --> 13:06.452
Ball.

13:07.119 --> 13:08.329
-[man] It's all right.
-You got this.

13:12.625 --> 13:14.585
Throw strikes, Tyler. Strike 'em out.

13:15.085 --> 13:16.295
[woman] Come on, Bulldogs.

13:19.340 --> 13:20.382
[umpire] Ball!

13:20.466 --> 13:21.342
[man] Come on.

13:22.009 --> 13:23.010
Relax!

13:24.094 --> 13:26.096
That's okay, Tyler, shake it off!

13:26.847 --> 13:28.516
[man] Deep breath, Ty. Breathe.

13:29.850 --> 13:31.811
[Noreen] You can do it. Make 'em swing.

13:32.561 --> 13:34.313
All right, why don't you sit down,
sweetheart, okay?

13:36.190 --> 13:38.609
I'm going to cheer for our son
as loud as I want.

13:39.026 --> 13:39.860
Okay.

13:41.237 --> 13:42.154
[man] Okay, Ty.

13:42.238 --> 13:43.489
Here we go, Tyler.

13:50.162 --> 13:51.288
[umpire] Ball three!

13:51.372 --> 13:53.791
You can do it, Ty!
Your dad and I believe in you!

13:54.667 --> 13:57.044
All this bad pitching
can't be good for the baby.

13:57.127 --> 13:58.712
Jackson, one more word out of you

13:58.796 --> 14:00.381
and you're benched
for the rest of the season.

14:00.923 --> 14:01.882
Sit down.

14:03.008 --> 14:04.510
-[man] Come on, Ty.
-[woman] Come on, Bulldogs.

14:04.593 --> 14:06.095
[man 2] Let's go, Bulldogs.

14:06.178 --> 14:07.388
[Noreen] Throw 'em out, Ty.

14:07.471 --> 14:09.098
[woman] Let's go, Bulldogs.

14:11.725 --> 14:13.769
[umpire] Ball four! Take your base.

14:14.603 --> 14:16.355
-Cal, wait.
-Time!

14:17.731 --> 14:18.732
[man] Brutal.

14:21.193 --> 14:22.403
[man 2] Focus up, Ty.

14:22.945 --> 14:23.988
[man 3] Help him out, Coach.

14:24.071 --> 14:25.614
Come on, Bulldogs. Let's go!

14:29.285 --> 14:30.744
[indistinct whispering]

14:44.842 --> 14:46.844
[indistinct whispering]

14:49.221 --> 14:52.057
I'm gonna go sit in the car.
This heat isn't good for the baby.

14:52.683 --> 14:54.977
[man] All right, Bulldogs.
Here we go! Here we go!

14:57.062 --> 14:58.188
We ready?

15:00.649 --> 15:02.443
[man 2] Here we go, Bulldogs.
Here we go, Bulldogs.

15:02.526 --> 15:03.569
[man 3] Pick it up now, Ty.

15:03.652 --> 15:04.820
-Come on. Let's go.
-Yeah.

15:05.237 --> 15:06.822
One batter at a time, okay?

15:08.824 --> 15:10.159
[umpire] Play ball!

15:15.748 --> 15:16.999
All right, son. Come on.

15:17.625 --> 15:18.542
Let's go.

15:21.503 --> 15:23.255
[indistinct chatter]

15:23.672 --> 15:26.800
Bailey, four swipes
won't get that counter clean. Do it again.

15:32.514 --> 15:35.559
I'm sure that the Department of Health
would appreciate your technique.

15:35.643 --> 15:37.436
-Yeah.
-Although,

15:37.937 --> 15:39.730
it's probably for the best
that they weren't present

15:39.813 --> 15:42.191
to witness that little food fight
that you had with Brad.

15:43.108 --> 15:44.109
So you heard about that.

15:46.612 --> 15:47.488
[sighs]

15:47.571 --> 15:49.490
How I let that man get under my skin,

15:49.573 --> 15:51.784
[stammers] I don't know. But he just--

15:51.867 --> 15:54.495
If I were here,
it wouldn't have just been one plate.

15:56.372 --> 15:58.040
What do I do the next time
he comes in here?

15:58.123 --> 15:59.041
Oh.

15:59.541 --> 16:01.293
I believe that Erik took care of that.

16:01.710 --> 16:04.004
Yeah, and what kind of boss am I?

16:04.088 --> 16:06.966
Getting my employees
all wrapped up in this mess.

16:07.508 --> 16:09.051
What if Brad goes to the police?

16:09.134 --> 16:10.052
Nah.

16:10.135 --> 16:12.513
Brad's ego's way too big
to go to the cops.

16:12.596 --> 16:14.390
He's never gonna step foot
in this place again.

16:15.099 --> 16:18.644
I can talk to Judge Sargent
about a restraining order,

16:18.727 --> 16:19.561
if that'll help?

16:21.647 --> 16:22.523
And the lawsuit?

16:22.982 --> 16:25.150
Dare you ask? I'll handle that.

16:25.776 --> 16:28.112
But it's gonna cost you a brownie.

16:28.195 --> 16:29.113
[chuckles]

16:29.446 --> 16:30.823
Take two, please.

16:30.906 --> 16:32.116
[Helen chuckles]

16:38.831 --> 16:40.457
For Skeeter's guys.

16:40.541 --> 16:43.043
-Ooh!
-Yeah, compliments of Erik.

16:43.502 --> 16:44.837
That is sweet of him.

16:44.920 --> 16:47.214
He told me he hoped
it would motivate them.

16:47.881 --> 16:50.092
Hey, why do they need to be motivated?

16:50.175 --> 16:51.135
Are we behind?

16:51.218 --> 16:53.971
Has Skeeter even ordered
the refrigerator yet?

16:54.054 --> 16:55.305
Yes, it's on back-order.

16:56.432 --> 16:58.017
Great. Great.

16:58.350 --> 17:00.769
Um, does he not know
that we're on a timeline?

17:00.853 --> 17:02.813
'Cause I don't know
if anyone else has seen this,

17:02.896 --> 17:06.483
but I don't have a fridge,
we don't have countertops.

17:06.567 --> 17:07.901
Okay, hold on, Dana Sue. Dana Sue.

17:07.985 --> 17:09.653
It-- It's gonna be okay.

17:11.321 --> 17:12.364
Wait, are you okay?

17:16.535 --> 17:18.454
Man, I used to be fun.

17:20.080 --> 17:21.248
Wasn't I fun?

17:21.331 --> 17:22.249
Yes.

17:22.791 --> 17:24.877
Man, remember our senior class trip?

17:24.960 --> 17:31.216
I got in a lot of trouble
because I was so much fun.

17:31.300 --> 17:33.343
Yes, that is one word to describe it.

17:33.427 --> 17:34.261
Mm-hmm.

17:34.344 --> 17:36.096
Two words would be "balloon dress."

17:36.680 --> 17:38.974
-I mean, not all the balloons popped.
-No.

17:39.058 --> 17:40.309
[both laugh]

17:40.392 --> 17:42.269
See? When did I stop being fun?

17:42.352 --> 17:44.188
You still kill at karaoke.

17:44.271 --> 17:46.899
Yeah. But, you know,
all I do anymore is just...

17:48.067 --> 17:49.860
[sighs]
I go around telling people what to do,

17:49.943 --> 17:51.570
and then snapping at 'em
when they don't do

17:51.653 --> 17:52.738
what I meant for them to do.

17:52.821 --> 17:55.491
Okay, stop.
Everyone at Sullivan's loves you.

17:55.574 --> 17:58.243
They obey me because I pay them.

17:58.327 --> 18:01.455
You think Erik put Brad on his rear end
because you pay him?

18:02.998 --> 18:03.916
Well, I...

18:05.167 --> 18:06.668
I don't know, I just...

18:06.752 --> 18:07.753
[exhales]

18:07.836 --> 18:10.172
...I just wish that I could relax.

18:11.173 --> 18:13.884
You know?
And, like, kick back with the crew

18:13.967 --> 18:15.219
like I did before.

18:15.302 --> 18:16.970
Before you were a boss.

18:17.721 --> 18:20.265
Honey, I know that you are stressed,
and you're tired.

18:20.349 --> 18:22.309
You know what I'm tired of?

18:22.392 --> 18:25.312
I am tired of building something
so a man can kick it down.

18:25.395 --> 18:27.940
The only thing
that Ronnie and Brad have in common

18:28.023 --> 18:29.733
is that you can succeed without them.

18:32.236 --> 18:33.153
Got it?

18:34.613 --> 18:35.739
[girl] Hey, Annie.

18:37.241 --> 18:39.034
Hey, Annie. You walking home?

18:39.409 --> 18:40.953
Uh, yeah. Didn't you have rehearsal?

18:41.036 --> 18:43.997
Not today. The lovers need extra work
with their scenes, so...

18:44.081 --> 18:45.499
My gosh, I would need so much work

18:45.582 --> 18:47.793
to pretend to be in love
with Billy Jeremiah.

18:47.876 --> 18:49.962
-[laughs]
-But with the right leading man?

18:50.045 --> 18:51.004
[phone chimes]

18:55.467 --> 18:56.301
Um...

18:57.094 --> 18:58.428
Kyle, I have to go back inside.

18:58.846 --> 18:59.847
-Uh...
-Sorry.

19:04.101 --> 19:06.436
I thought it'd be fun for you to wear
to Ty's next ball game.

19:08.438 --> 19:10.023
Mine's just for, you know, like,

19:10.107 --> 19:12.276
when I'm around the house,
or the kids come over.

19:13.152 --> 19:16.363
'Cause I'm pretty sure
no one wants me at the ball games.

19:18.407 --> 19:19.324
Um...

19:19.741 --> 19:20.576
Noreen.

19:21.160 --> 19:23.912
About that. Sweetheart, it's just...

19:25.622 --> 19:30.294
Well, Coach Maddox thinks
that Tyler can't concentrate

19:30.377 --> 19:34.256
when you're there, so, you know,
he doesn't play well,

19:34.339 --> 19:39.303
and right now we're all just trying to do
what's best for Tyler, right?

19:39.678 --> 19:42.598
But is this what's best?
We're building a family here.

19:42.681 --> 19:45.142
And how is he supposed to understand
how much he means to me

19:45.225 --> 19:48.061
if I can't share the one thing
that means the most to him?

19:48.145 --> 19:49.688
I don't know, darlin',

19:49.771 --> 19:52.107
but nobody wants to hurt you here, okay?

19:52.524 --> 19:54.318
I'm trying to be a good mom.

19:54.401 --> 19:56.236
And a good mom would be at his games.

19:56.320 --> 19:58.572
Tyler's mom is at his games.

20:07.497 --> 20:08.582
[sighs]

20:11.293 --> 20:12.586
[door opens]

20:15.047 --> 20:16.089
You're late.

20:16.548 --> 20:19.051
Had stuff to do. For an assignment.

20:19.134 --> 20:21.136
I appreciate a text, you know that.

20:23.096 --> 20:25.182
Wanna talk about the grade on your paper?

20:25.265 --> 20:26.767
Seems you already know.

20:26.850 --> 20:30.437
You know, I asked you to let me proof it,
and you didn't. Why?

20:30.854 --> 20:32.856
It was one paper, and it didn't matter.

20:32.940 --> 20:34.983
Annie, you and I both know

20:35.067 --> 20:37.402
that you are capable
of getting better than a C.

20:37.486 --> 20:39.988
Why are you always trying
to turn me into Little Miss Perfect?

20:40.405 --> 20:43.575
All you do is order everybody around,
expecting them to be flawless.

20:45.035 --> 20:47.454
[stammers] I do not expect perfection.

20:47.996 --> 20:50.040
I do expect best efforts,

20:50.499 --> 20:54.044
-and it's okay to mess up if you--
-No, it's not! Not around you.

20:54.711 --> 20:56.838
When somebody screws up,
you get mad and yell, and--

20:56.922 --> 20:59.758
I might lose my temper
every once in a while,

20:59.841 --> 21:02.511
but when I do, I apologize.

21:03.053 --> 21:04.513
Did you apologize to Brad?

21:05.847 --> 21:06.765
Brad?

21:06.848 --> 21:09.685
You fired him
because he made some little fail.

21:09.768 --> 21:13.939
Okay, I-- I don't know
what you think you know,

21:14.022 --> 21:16.400
but Brad made an epic fail.

21:16.483 --> 21:17.484
What about Dad?

21:18.443 --> 21:20.362
You know, one mistake
and you threw him out

21:20.445 --> 21:22.030
before he could even apologize.

21:24.116 --> 21:26.576
Annie Lenore Sullivan,

21:26.660 --> 21:30.247
you know that what your father did
was more than just one mistake.

21:30.330 --> 21:33.542
No, he messed up once,
and you ran him out of town.

21:34.001 --> 21:35.419
Is that what you're gonna do to me?

21:35.502 --> 21:37.296
If I get another C,
you're just gonna ship me off

21:37.379 --> 21:38.672
to St. Agnes with the wayward girls?

21:38.755 --> 21:40.882
Don't you dare talk to me this way.

21:41.300 --> 21:43.010
-You need--
-To shut up?

21:43.093 --> 21:45.971
To go away. Yeah, sure thing, boss lady.

21:46.930 --> 21:47.806
Oh, dear.

21:48.307 --> 21:49.641
[exhales]

22:02.738 --> 22:03.947
Well, good morning.

22:07.117 --> 22:10.078
Yeah, I know you're not allowed
a real mimosa,

22:10.162 --> 22:12.456
so we'll just pretend, all right?

22:15.083 --> 22:16.877
Are we not going into the office?

22:17.711 --> 22:19.796
No, we are. I just, uh...

22:20.672 --> 22:23.216
Well,
I thought we'd share a nice breakfast.

22:23.633 --> 22:25.802
Which you made all on your own.

22:27.137 --> 22:30.515
Well, no call does sound suspicious.
I, uh...

22:32.517 --> 22:36.188
Well, look, I'm--
I'm hoping today's a better day.

22:38.857 --> 22:39.733
Thank you.

22:41.109 --> 22:43.236
Starting off like this,
I'm sure it will be.

22:44.029 --> 22:44.905
Hey, come here.

22:50.077 --> 22:51.453
Let me take you to a movie.

22:52.829 --> 22:53.705
Come on.

22:54.122 --> 22:56.333
I'm on call tonight,
but how about tomorrow?

22:56.792 --> 22:59.878
All right? You pick what we see
and how much butter we put on the popcorn.

22:59.961 --> 23:02.589
-Ty has a game, and it's one of yours.
-Well...

23:04.049 --> 23:05.300
this is just as important.

23:06.093 --> 23:08.428
And Maddie'd be happy to go.

23:11.681 --> 23:12.682
You're so sweet,

23:12.766 --> 23:15.185
but I know how much
Ty's games mean to you.

23:15.268 --> 23:17.062
You're not gonna miss one 'cause of me.

23:17.854 --> 23:18.730
You sure?

23:21.149 --> 23:22.234
Of course.

23:22.651 --> 23:23.485
Oh...

23:23.860 --> 23:25.445
You're a good woman, Noreen.

23:33.995 --> 23:36.498
[Helen] There's still so much work to do
at the spa.

23:36.581 --> 23:37.916
We're not gonna open on time.

23:37.999 --> 23:41.503
Master scheduler that you are,
I can imagine that's a struggle.

23:41.586 --> 23:43.797
But I knew
that renovating Ms. Frances's house

23:43.880 --> 23:48.510
was gonna be a huge undertaking,
but there have been so many surprises,

23:48.593 --> 23:51.012
and I do not like surprises.

23:51.096 --> 23:52.556
Of course not.

23:52.639 --> 23:56.017
They remind us that we're not in control.

23:57.352 --> 23:59.271
[laughs] But you were saying?

24:01.356 --> 24:02.399
[groans]

24:03.400 --> 24:04.901
Skeeter has been a wonder,

24:05.819 --> 24:07.904
but there's only so much
that he can do with his crew.

24:08.321 --> 24:10.031
What happens
if you don't meet your deadline?

24:10.115 --> 24:13.243
We really want to open
on Ms. Frances's birthday to honor her.

24:14.536 --> 24:18.290
Ms. Frances was one of the first people
I met in Serenity.

24:18.373 --> 24:20.667
-She was on your call committee.
-Mm-hmm.

24:21.251 --> 24:24.463
She was quiet,
but I could tell her opinion.

24:24.546 --> 24:25.714
[chuckles]

24:26.298 --> 24:28.967
Even in silence,
it carried a lot of weight.

24:29.926 --> 24:31.178
When she did speak,

24:32.012 --> 24:34.556
it wasn't about doctrine or budget.

24:35.307 --> 24:36.725
It was about community,

24:37.225 --> 24:41.229
about how Serenity should
always welcome the stranger,

24:41.313 --> 24:42.689
and feed the hungry,

24:42.772 --> 24:44.316
and give the thirsty a drink.

24:44.399 --> 24:45.233
Oh, my.

24:48.195 --> 24:51.031
She told me a story
about three little girls

24:51.114 --> 24:53.450
who came to her on a hot summer day.

24:53.533 --> 24:54.534
[laughs]

24:54.618 --> 24:58.788
And asked if they could build
a lemonade stand on her corner.

24:58.872 --> 25:00.957
Now, why do you suppose
they wanted to use her corner?

25:01.750 --> 25:04.586
Uh, because
it was the busiest corner in town.

25:05.086 --> 25:07.756
Everybody, fancy, poor, and in between,

25:07.839 --> 25:10.800
it seemed like they'd have to come across
that corner

25:10.884 --> 25:12.385
at some point during the day.

25:12.469 --> 25:14.763
And it-- it was so hot

25:15.222 --> 25:16.973
that we knew
that they would need a lemonade.

25:17.057 --> 25:17.891
Mm-hmm.

25:17.974 --> 25:19.684
Give the thirsty a drink.

25:19.768 --> 25:22.604
[laughs] Our first venture together.

25:27.400 --> 25:28.818
Here's the thing about being the one

25:28.902 --> 25:31.488
who's always standing behind
the lemonade stand.

25:32.656 --> 25:35.325
You forget that you get thirsty too.

25:36.368 --> 25:39.788
You forget how
to let someone else pour for you.

25:41.081 --> 25:44.251
Ms. Frances will be honored
no matter what day you open.

25:45.085 --> 25:48.004
And there is no dishonor
in asking for help.

25:51.383 --> 25:52.717
[chuckles, sniffles]

25:53.552 --> 25:56.888
Why don't we step on out
across to Wharton's?

25:56.972 --> 25:59.599
I have this sudden hankering for lemonade.

25:59.683 --> 26:01.476
-Ooh. Let's go.
-[laughs]

26:01.560 --> 26:03.770
-[June] Don't have to tell me twice.
-[both laugh]

26:04.604 --> 26:06.231
[Max] How about this?

26:06.731 --> 26:08.942
[Maddie] Ooh.
Maybe something not so bright?

26:09.025 --> 26:11.903
This shade would scare Van Gogh. [laughs]

26:11.987 --> 26:13.113
All right. Van Gogh.

26:13.947 --> 26:15.740
♪ Go, go, gooo ♪

26:16.324 --> 26:18.952
All right, well, how about... these?

26:19.035 --> 26:20.954
-This is a little better, right?
-Mm-hmm.

26:21.037 --> 26:21.997
So much.

26:23.456 --> 26:24.332
Oh, I, uh...

26:24.916 --> 26:28.003
If you'll excuse me,
I have to alphabetize the hammers.

26:28.086 --> 26:29.296
[chuckles] Okay.

26:33.008 --> 26:33.883
Hey, Noreen.

26:34.718 --> 26:36.219
Shouldn't you be at Ty's baseball game?

26:37.721 --> 26:40.432
Bill and I decided
I shouldn't go to the games anymore.

26:41.766 --> 26:42.851
Oh. I'm sorry. I didn't--

26:42.934 --> 26:46.646
Those bleachers,
they're just so hard on my back right now.

26:51.526 --> 26:53.320
And this gives me more time

26:53.403 --> 26:56.489
to make some choices about the nursery
without Bill hanging around, and...

26:59.618 --> 27:03.038
We-- We wanna be surprised
whether it's a boy or a girl,

27:03.121 --> 27:07.459
so... I was thinking about a light green.

27:08.209 --> 27:09.044
It's lovely.

27:10.962 --> 27:13.256
But there's nothing wrong with yellow.

27:13.965 --> 27:15.008
No, there's not.

27:16.635 --> 27:19.012
It's just so hard to decide.

27:21.264 --> 27:22.182
Takes time.

27:33.693 --> 27:34.778
[sighs]

27:36.196 --> 27:40.700
And, Peanut, you'll be brave,
and strong, and confident.

27:41.618 --> 27:44.788
And you'll be such a good person
that even when you make mistakes,

27:44.871 --> 27:47.123
people will forgive you
because you have such a good heart.

27:48.375 --> 27:50.835
But, remember, if you ever feel all alone,

27:51.670 --> 27:53.505
no one can love you more than I do.

27:57.634 --> 27:58.593
[Kyle] Hey, Noreen.

27:59.636 --> 28:00.970
Kyle, what are you doing here?

28:01.054 --> 28:02.055
Practicing my lines.

28:02.555 --> 28:03.932
My whole part of the play
takes place outside,

28:04.015 --> 28:05.975
so I thought it'd be fun
to rehearse out here.

28:06.059 --> 28:08.561
And a lot more fun
than standing around in the hardware store

28:08.645 --> 28:12.023
-while my mom picks out paint.
-Yeah. That's not my favorite either.

28:12.107 --> 28:12.982
Yeah.

28:14.067 --> 28:15.694
-Can I sit?
-Yeah.

28:23.910 --> 28:26.204
How come you're not at Ty's game?
With Dad?

28:31.668 --> 28:34.087
Relationships are hard, aren't they?

28:35.338 --> 28:36.673
Something happen, sweetie?

28:37.048 --> 28:38.758
[chuckles] More like something didn't.

28:39.384 --> 28:42.595
W-- Why does all this have to be
so difficult?

28:44.931 --> 28:47.726
Remember: Girls are just as nervous
as you are,

28:48.143 --> 28:50.019
and they get their feelings hurt too.

28:51.104 --> 28:52.981
They just want to know
you're thinking about 'em.

28:53.064 --> 28:54.858
But what if that's all
you're thinking about?

28:54.941 --> 28:57.944
[chuckles] I mean, why can't they
just know that you like them?

28:59.404 --> 29:00.822
I'd know if a girl liked me.

29:03.241 --> 29:05.368
If there's somebody you like, hang tough.

29:05.994 --> 29:07.287
And if you don't give up,

29:07.370 --> 29:10.248
eventually, she'll see how you feel,
and she'll love you too.

29:17.714 --> 29:18.715
[door opens]

29:23.720 --> 29:24.637
[door closes]

29:25.305 --> 29:26.473
Hey, sweetie.

29:27.182 --> 29:29.267
How was your day?

29:29.350 --> 29:30.935
Didn't realize how late it is.

29:31.644 --> 29:32.520
Good night.

29:33.563 --> 29:35.440
[retreating footsteps]

29:36.149 --> 29:37.317
[sighs]

29:37.400 --> 29:38.443
[door closes]

29:46.910 --> 29:47.952
[sighs]

29:49.871 --> 29:50.705
[sploshing]

29:51.414 --> 29:52.332
Ugh.

29:53.166 --> 29:54.083
Oh, gosh.

30:03.218 --> 30:05.011
[grunts, squeals]

30:05.762 --> 30:07.680
[squeaking]

30:08.389 --> 30:09.349
[grunts]

30:11.643 --> 30:12.477
[sighs]

30:16.731 --> 30:20.026
[Skeeter] Didn't know there were
this many plumbers in the whole county.

30:20.109 --> 30:22.153
What do you have on Santa Claus?

30:22.237 --> 30:25.448
[Helen, chuckles] It's the other
Christmas guy who inspired me.

30:25.949 --> 30:27.784
And Pastor June reminded me

30:27.867 --> 30:30.787
that neighbors should be eager
to help each other out,

30:31.538 --> 30:33.456
and just as willing to ask for help.

30:34.582 --> 30:37.001
-They are residential plumbers, though.
-[groans]

30:37.085 --> 30:39.587
They know enough.
And what they don't know,

30:39.671 --> 30:41.381
you can show 'em.

30:43.591 --> 30:44.592
You are relentless.

30:44.676 --> 30:45.969
[laughing]

30:46.344 --> 30:48.555
I-- If you ever decide
to quit being a lawyer,

30:48.638 --> 30:52.183
-I'd give you a job in a heartbeat.
-Skeeter!

30:52.267 --> 30:53.518
I'll keep my shoes handy.

30:54.185 --> 30:55.478
-All right.
-[laughs]

30:56.896 --> 30:57.939
[Maddie sighs]

30:58.314 --> 30:59.732
Oh, gosh.

31:05.280 --> 31:06.322
[sighs]

31:10.368 --> 31:11.327
[phone chimes]

31:16.374 --> 31:17.500
Hey, it's Maddie.

31:18.001 --> 31:20.211
Um, I can't believe
I'm calling you like this,

31:20.295 --> 31:21.838
but I have tried everyone,

31:21.921 --> 31:24.090
and there is not an available plumber
in the county

31:24.173 --> 31:25.842
and my kitchen sink is leaking.

31:27.552 --> 31:31.139
Yeah. N-- No.
I-- I-- No, I knew enough to do that.

31:33.308 --> 31:34.392
I'd be grateful.

31:36.561 --> 31:37.645
[phone chimes]

31:43.443 --> 31:44.903
-Whoa.
-Whoa. I'm sorry. Hi.

31:45.737 --> 31:47.071
[chuckles] Erik.

31:47.739 --> 31:48.573
-Hi.
-Hi.

31:48.656 --> 31:50.742
It's, uh... nice to run into ya.

31:50.825 --> 31:51.701
[both laugh]

31:55.121 --> 31:55.955
Um...

31:56.664 --> 31:58.750
that was so sweet of you
to send over that cobbler.

31:59.542 --> 32:02.211
If there is anything
that'll make Skeeter's crew work harder

32:02.295 --> 32:04.088
than overtime pay, it's sweets.

32:04.172 --> 32:05.173
[both laugh]

32:05.256 --> 32:06.132
Did they enjoy it?

32:06.215 --> 32:08.885
Oh, they're not getting that
until the pipes are working.

32:09.677 --> 32:10.970
Incentives, my dear.

32:11.429 --> 32:13.306
Oh, such a taskmaster.

32:13.389 --> 32:14.974
[both laugh]

32:15.058 --> 32:17.644
-Remind me to stay on your good side.
-[both laugh]

32:18.353 --> 32:19.812
Well, who says that you are?

32:21.439 --> 32:22.440
All right.

32:23.149 --> 32:24.400
Erik, uh...

32:25.026 --> 32:28.738
thank you for taking Brad outside
for a little conversation.

32:29.447 --> 32:31.658
It was above and beyond
your job requirements.

32:31.741 --> 32:35.161
Well, I didn't do that as Chef's employee.
I did it as Dana Sue's friend.

32:35.244 --> 32:38.414
Well, she needed that. So thanks a bushel.

32:42.502 --> 32:43.836
I gotta...

32:43.920 --> 32:45.088
Yeah, I gotta run.

32:45.171 --> 32:46.673
-[laughs]
-Yeah.

32:55.682 --> 32:58.726
So, I turned off the water,
but it's still a mess.

32:58.810 --> 32:59.769
Are you ready?

33:02.605 --> 33:03.898
Yeah. Let's do this.

33:04.315 --> 33:05.274
Okay.

33:06.359 --> 33:09.153
-Uh, well, it looks like you tamed it.
-Yeah.

33:09.237 --> 33:10.989
Here, hold this. I'm going in.

33:12.657 --> 33:14.075
[sighs] Let's see here.

33:14.158 --> 33:15.368
So, it was, um...

33:15.451 --> 33:17.203
It was-- It was coming from here,

33:17.286 --> 33:19.080
but it was, like, shooting...

33:20.248 --> 33:24.168
It was shooting. Well, it was spraying,
like, this... in this direction.

33:24.252 --> 33:25.169
That way?

33:25.545 --> 33:26.546
I'm trying to be specific.

33:27.296 --> 33:29.298
-And I appreciate that.
-Okay, I don't want you

33:29.382 --> 33:32.301
to get hit in the face
with a bunch of water.

33:32.385 --> 33:33.428
[Maddie screams]

33:33.511 --> 33:34.804
-[Cal] Yup.
-Just like that.

33:34.887 --> 33:36.139
That's it. Goodness.

33:36.222 --> 33:37.974
-[Cal] Yep.
-Gosh. Let me put a towel down.

33:38.057 --> 33:39.559
[Cal] There's always something left
in the pipes.

33:39.642 --> 33:40.560
-Okay.
-[Cal] All right.

33:40.643 --> 33:42.437
So your connectors are loose.

33:42.520 --> 33:44.397
That's easy enough to fix.

33:44.480 --> 33:46.607
Okay. Let me get this out of here.

33:47.400 --> 33:48.943
-That should do it.
-[Maddie screams]

33:49.027 --> 33:52.530
No, that's not it.
Oh, my gosh, tighten it. Oh, gosh.

33:52.613 --> 33:53.990
[Cal grunting]

33:54.073 --> 33:56.492
Yeah, okay, all right,
I need the heavy artillery.

33:56.576 --> 33:58.494
Okay. Incoming.

33:58.578 --> 33:59.620
Thank you.

34:00.121 --> 34:00.955
All right.

34:01.414 --> 34:02.582
-[knob squeaking]
-[Cal grunts]

34:02.665 --> 34:03.624
All right.

34:04.292 --> 34:05.376
That should do it.

34:05.460 --> 34:06.627
Okay. Well, so you said.

34:06.711 --> 34:07.837
[both chuckle]

34:07.920 --> 34:09.464
Wait, how many more towels do you have?

34:09.547 --> 34:10.923
[laughs] Not enough.

34:11.007 --> 34:11.966
[Cal] Okay.

34:12.050 --> 34:13.342
-Okay.
-[Cal sighs]

34:14.010 --> 34:14.844
Victory.

34:16.054 --> 34:17.764
-[Cal sighs]
-Yeah, victory.

34:17.847 --> 34:18.681
[Cal exhales]

34:18.765 --> 34:19.807
Thank you so much.

34:19.891 --> 34:21.768
I made it look a lot harder than it was.

34:21.851 --> 34:23.644
[laughs] Yeah.
This is always the type of thing

34:23.728 --> 34:25.063
that Bill would take care of.

34:25.146 --> 34:27.690
And by take care of,
I mean, he would call a plumber.

34:27.774 --> 34:29.358
Which I did call a few of them,

34:29.442 --> 34:31.944
but Helen's got 'em all rounded up
working at the spa, so...

34:32.028 --> 34:33.654
-Thank you.
-It was really no big deal.

34:33.738 --> 34:35.281
Well, it was to me. [chuckles]

34:39.368 --> 34:40.787
Um, do you want a drink?

34:41.829 --> 34:44.040
Or you can, um--
You could stay for dinner?

34:44.123 --> 34:45.333
The kids are almost home.

34:45.416 --> 34:47.251
I-- It'll be something simple.

34:50.254 --> 34:51.130
I love simple.

34:52.381 --> 34:54.675
-Um, okay.
-If you're sure it's not too much trouble.

34:54.759 --> 34:57.970
No, it's fine. I always make enough
for a ball team. You know.

34:58.054 --> 34:59.180
[both] Teenage boys.

35:01.224 --> 35:03.726
Um, okay. So, well, I'll set you a plate.

35:03.810 --> 35:05.645
-[squeak]
-Oh! Hey, careful.

35:09.232 --> 35:10.274
[Ty] What the...

35:12.443 --> 35:14.070
Ty. Hi.

35:14.153 --> 35:15.029
Coach?

35:15.571 --> 35:16.405
Mom?

35:18.032 --> 35:19.492
-You're wet.
-Yeah.

35:20.076 --> 35:21.953
[stammers] Well, the sink, it busted,

35:22.036 --> 35:25.623
and I just--
I called Coach Maddox to fix it, so...

35:25.706 --> 35:26.582
You what?

35:27.166 --> 35:28.835
I'm gonna take a rain check on dinner.

35:28.918 --> 35:30.962
-You guys have a good night.
-Okay.

35:31.629 --> 35:32.630
Thank you.

35:55.987 --> 35:56.904
[phone chimes]

35:56.988 --> 35:57.989
Oh, Peggy.

36:09.458 --> 36:11.002
I've seen enough episodes of Suits

36:11.085 --> 36:14.213
to know Brad doesn't have a leg
to stand on with that lawsuit.

36:14.297 --> 36:16.299
Uh, you know, it's-- it's not...

36:17.925 --> 36:18.885
I... [sighs]

36:18.968 --> 36:19.802
Chef,

36:20.803 --> 36:21.679
you hired Isaac.

36:22.513 --> 36:25.183
Even though he didn't know a braising pot
from a flowerpot,

36:26.058 --> 36:27.518
and you've taught him.

36:27.602 --> 36:28.686
Encouraged him.

36:29.270 --> 36:31.731
Now you've moved him up
from dishwashing to the line.

36:32.148 --> 36:34.567
Even though he's still learning
to properly scrub a stockpot.

36:34.650 --> 36:35.693
[chuckles]

36:35.776 --> 36:37.153
You know, I'm standing right here.

36:37.945 --> 36:38.946
[chuckles]

36:39.030 --> 36:41.741
I know you don't like compliments
unless it's about your food,

36:42.241 --> 36:43.534
but you're a good boss.

36:44.368 --> 36:46.704
Don't beat yourself up over one bad apple.

36:48.831 --> 36:49.749
Thank you.

36:50.291 --> 36:51.209
Mm-hmm.

36:52.710 --> 36:53.794
This looks good.

36:53.878 --> 36:55.296
[Erik] Well, dig in.

36:55.379 --> 36:56.380
[laughs]

36:58.466 --> 36:59.425
[Dana Sue groans]

36:59.800 --> 37:00.635
Chef?

37:01.552 --> 37:03.304
Oh, now, you know he was teasing.

37:04.222 --> 37:06.891
Uh, I think there's something else
you should know about Brad.

37:13.731 --> 37:15.066
It was a weird day.

37:16.275 --> 37:19.320
What, like "polka-dotted fish
with two heads" weird,

37:19.403 --> 37:22.281
or, like,
"not everybody likes Beyoncé" weird?

37:22.365 --> 37:25.952
Like,
"I thought we were working out" weird?

37:26.035 --> 37:27.828
Oh! Oh.

37:29.580 --> 37:32.375
So, it's gonna be one of those days
where you don't want to chat about it,

37:32.458 --> 37:34.710
so I start talking really fast
in long run-on sentences,

37:34.794 --> 37:37.213
and you get tired of listening to how long
I can speak without taking a breath,

37:37.296 --> 37:39.048
'cause I have amazing core strength
and breath control

37:39.131 --> 37:40.299
and eventually, you give in and tell me.

37:40.383 --> 37:42.301
-Is that what it's gonna be like tonight?
-Yeah, you know what?

37:42.385 --> 37:43.386
I surrender, okay.

37:44.929 --> 37:46.555
I saw the mom today.

37:49.016 --> 37:49.892
Hmm.

37:50.685 --> 37:52.687
Didn't I tell you it was a bad idea? Yeah.

37:52.770 --> 37:55.189
No. No, no, no.
I know I told you it was a bad idea.

37:55.273 --> 37:57.692
-Even Ashley told you it was a bad idea.
-This is a bad idea,

37:57.775 --> 38:02.905
yeah, no, I know. Especially since
she's the mom of a player.

38:04.323 --> 38:05.366
My star player.

38:09.203 --> 38:10.371
The mom is Madd--

38:10.997 --> 38:12.832
-Hmm.
-The mom is Maddie Townsend?

38:12.915 --> 38:15.293
Yeah, I know you guys don't approve,
but I just--

38:15.376 --> 38:16.836
Oh, no. No, no, no, no.

38:16.919 --> 38:20.339
I definitely think you should ask out
my brand-new boss, Maddie.

38:20.423 --> 38:22.383
-The four of us could even double-date.
-[laughs]

38:22.466 --> 38:23.801
Oh, my gosh.

38:25.761 --> 38:26.721
However...

38:27.346 --> 38:30.349
However, I know what she's going through,
I've been through it.

38:30.850 --> 38:32.518
Like, I don't want to push her,

38:33.227 --> 38:35.396
but I can't exactly walk away.

38:37.648 --> 38:40.026
It's the age-old pull between the heart
and the head, my friend.

38:40.109 --> 38:41.736
You need to respect a lady
and give her space,

38:41.819 --> 38:43.988
but you can't wait to be up close
and personal.

38:46.532 --> 38:48.617
This is a place country music comes from.

38:49.118 --> 38:50.077
[chuckles]

38:52.038 --> 38:53.789
[blender whirring]

38:54.999 --> 38:57.084
So, I was thinking that, um,

38:57.168 --> 39:00.296
that we should hire Cal
to do some plumbing at the spa.

39:00.379 --> 39:02.923
I thought you said Skeeter had it handled.

39:03.007 --> 39:04.300
And he does.

39:04.800 --> 39:08.929
But if Cal is gonna go around town
doing naked plumbing,

39:09.013 --> 39:13.059
oh, I will punch some holes
so I can call him up and enjoy the show.

39:13.142 --> 39:16.020
[laughs] He was not naked.

39:16.103 --> 39:17.021
[laughs]

39:17.104 --> 39:19.231
He was just... wet.

39:19.315 --> 39:22.151
-[Helen] Mm-hmm.
-He was very, very wet.

39:22.818 --> 39:24.904
You know who drove by and saw him?

39:25.613 --> 39:26.572
[Dana Sue] Mary Vaughn Lewis.

39:26.655 --> 39:27.907
-Oh, Lord.
-[Helen] Please.

39:27.990 --> 39:30.826
And Mary Vaughn told Peggy,
and Peggy told Mary Lee,

39:30.910 --> 39:32.578
and Mary Lee told Lee Ann...

39:33.245 --> 39:37.917
that she drove by
and saw him shirtless and glistening.

39:38.334 --> 39:39.293
[laughs]

39:39.377 --> 39:41.212
-[Dana Sue] Glistening in the driveway.
-He was dripping.

39:41.295 --> 39:43.964
And they gave him six abs up.

39:44.048 --> 39:45.674
He deserves it.

39:45.758 --> 39:49.178
Well, I heard that he was practically
doing a Magic Mike routine

39:49.261 --> 39:50.596
in the middle of the street.

39:50.679 --> 39:52.139
-Lord have mercy.
-Mm.

39:52.848 --> 39:53.974
Seriously, though...

39:55.184 --> 39:57.436
staring at him in that wet T-shirt,

39:57.853 --> 39:59.397
all I could think of was Helen.

39:59.980 --> 40:01.232
-Why?
-[laughs]

40:01.315 --> 40:03.984
Because she said that it was impossible

40:04.068 --> 40:06.320
to be just friends with a man
that ridiculously hot.

40:06.404 --> 40:11.659
Exactly. Exactly. And that is why
you should be friends...

40:12.535 --> 40:13.494
with benefits.

40:13.577 --> 40:14.995
Oh, my Lord...

40:15.079 --> 40:17.957
Come bring that in.
You want to, and there it is.

40:18.040 --> 40:19.166
[all laughing]

40:19.250 --> 40:22.837
So that's the secret to happiness:
a plumber. A wet plumber.

40:22.920 --> 40:24.672
I guess so. [laughs]

40:24.755 --> 40:25.589
Well, you know,

40:25.673 --> 40:27.967
I guess I'll have to bust some pipes
down at the restaurant.

40:29.051 --> 40:30.386
Are things not improving?

40:30.928 --> 40:34.723
I just-- I know that my staff thinks
I'm authoritarian,

40:35.182 --> 40:36.725
and my daughter agrees.

40:36.809 --> 40:38.894
-[Helen] Oh, she's a teenager.
-Yeah.

40:38.978 --> 40:41.230
You should have heard
some of the things she said to me.

40:41.605 --> 40:42.690
About Ronnie.

40:43.732 --> 40:45.401
She even stood up for Brad.

40:45.484 --> 40:48.404
-I repeat: She's a teenager.
-Yeah.

40:48.487 --> 40:50.197
She doesn't believe half the stuff
she says.

40:51.115 --> 40:52.241
Yeah, well, what half though?

40:52.324 --> 40:53.284
[crunching]

40:53.367 --> 40:54.452
Okay.

40:54.535 --> 40:58.831
That's a thing that being a boss
and a mom have in common.

40:58.914 --> 41:00.332
They both can suck sometimes.

41:00.416 --> 41:01.333
Man...

41:01.667 --> 41:03.544
I used to be the life of the party.

41:03.627 --> 41:05.546
And you two know it. Right?

41:05.629 --> 41:07.715
And you were the bossy one.

41:07.798 --> 41:09.133
Determined!

41:09.216 --> 41:11.594
-And you were the sensible one.
-Well, look where that got me.

41:13.262 --> 41:14.180
You're gonna be fine.

41:14.263 --> 41:16.348
-Okay.
-Hmm. And you're not?

41:17.266 --> 41:18.934
I don't know. Sometimes I wonder.

41:20.144 --> 41:21.187
I'm just tired.

41:21.854 --> 41:23.689
I'm tired of Annie being angry,

41:23.772 --> 41:26.400
and I'm tired of my staff being prickly,
and...

41:27.568 --> 41:28.444
[sighs]

41:28.527 --> 41:30.821
It'd be so much easier
if everyone just liked me.

41:31.780 --> 41:32.740
We like you.

41:33.782 --> 41:35.534
-Most of the time.
-[laughs]

41:35.618 --> 41:36.744
You're awful.

41:37.286 --> 41:38.496
Oh, you're the worst.

41:38.579 --> 41:40.289
[Helen laughing]

41:45.503 --> 41:46.795
[water splashing]

41:48.839 --> 41:51.217
I'm gonna run this over to the bank.
Be right back.

41:51.300 --> 41:52.760
I'll be here. Scrubbing.

41:55.846 --> 41:56.722
[door closes]

42:19.245 --> 42:21.247
[instrumental music playing]

43:18.095 --> 43:19.221
[music fades out]
