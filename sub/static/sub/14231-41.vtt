is that what you mean?

is a little brother,

Hey, spiffy idea, Pistol.

Oh, yeah!

07:08.261 --> 07:10.347
Thought he had it made in the shade,
too,

07:10.472 --> 07:12.849
Till the bundle of joy boy showed up.

07:12.932 --> 07:14.184

07:14.267 --> 07:16.561
That baby took center stage
with his folks.

07:16.644 --> 07:18.021
Like he was Elvis or something.

07:18.104 --> 07:20.190
And all of a sudden Freddie was a zero.

07:20.315 --> 07:23.902

07:23.985 --> 07:27.364
a good little dog hair picking
car waxer?

07:27.447 --> 07:29.240
What if Dad likes him better than me?

07:29.324 --> 07:31.618
I mean, Pistol already does,

07:31.701 --> 07:34.204
and she hasn't even seen him yet.

07:34.287 --> 07:35.830
I could be...

Who takes out the trash?

07:57.644 --> 07:59.688

and worships his mother?

08:03.233 --> 08:05.068
Me, me, me!

08:07.946 --> 08:10.281
A little boy from a little town,

08:10.407 --> 08:13.451
just trying to do his chores.

I put my captain's hat?

What's a guy got to do around here

09:35.492 --> 09:37.243

09:37.702 --> 09:40.997
Never seen so much hard work from one kid
in my whole life.

09:41.122 --> 09:43.750
That's what I call earning your allowance,
P.J.

09:43.833 --> 09:45.627
No, Dad, he's gotta do it.

10:07.023 --> 10:11.861
Congratulations on
the new little addition, Dad.

10:12.696 --> 10:14.072
Don't! Don't touch her!

10:14.155 --> 10:15.407
She isn't ready yet.

10:15.615 --> 10:17.283

Oh, no. I mean the baby that
Peg's having.

Was that boat polish in my ears,
or did you say Peg's having a baby?

10:28.003 --> 10:30.839
Hm. Mean she forgot to tell you?

10:30.922 --> 10:33.508
Well, I guess with all the excitement
and everything--

Why doesn't anybody tell me these things?

11:01.494 --> 11:04.831
What am I gonna do? What am I gonna do?
What am I gonna do?

11:04.998 --> 11:07.125
What else? You feed him
and burp him,

11:07.208 --> 11:08.335
and sing him a lullaby,

11:08.418 --> 11:10.211
and put him to sleep in the nursery.

11:10.295 --> 11:11.463
Yeah, that's right.

11:12.088 --> 11:14.090
We don't have a nursery!

11:14.174 --> 11:18.136
Well, maybe you can build one
before Peg gets home.

11:19.387 --> 11:21.222
G-g-great idea!

11:21.306 --> 11:23.600
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Here! Hold these,

11:23.683 --> 11:25.060
Some of these.

11:25.143 --> 11:27.896
Hold everything! I'll be right back.

11:30.315 --> 11:33.818
You know...
Maybe we're targeting the wrong audience.

11:35.403 --> 11:39.074
Eighty-five gallons of sweat later
you tell me this?

11:39.157 --> 11:41.284
Peejster, sweetie baby,

11:41.826 --> 11:45.497
seems to me Pistol's the one
who wanted the new bro.

11:45.580 --> 11:48.500
-So?
-So, what if it proved

11:48.583 --> 11:52.212
you're the number one
box-office attraction in her G-rated life?

11:52.295 --> 11:53.546
Max.

11:53.630 --> 11:57.258
You are gonna be all the playmate
Pistol ever wants.

11:57.384 --> 11:58.968
Oh, not again, Max.

11:59.052 --> 12:02.180
You are gonna stake out
your brotherly territory,

12:02.263 --> 12:03.682
if it kills you.

12:05.141 --> 12:06.393
Thanks, P.J..

12:06.476 --> 12:09.312
We haven't played
The Spider and The Fly in days!

12:09.771 --> 12:11.439
Help me!

12:11.523 --> 12:13.149
Whee!

12:13.233 --> 12:14.818
I've got you in my web!

12:14.901 --> 12:15.860
Whoa!

12:15.985 --> 12:17.529
[babbling]

12:21.199 --> 12:22.325
[laughing]

12:22.492 --> 12:23.827
That's so fun!

12:23.910 --> 12:25.870
Let's do it again! Let's do it again!

12:26.579 --> 12:28.289
I can't take anymore!

12:28.373 --> 12:29.958
I tried so hard,

12:30.041 --> 12:32.127
but I give up!

12:32.919 --> 12:34.671
I'll even join the foreign legion.

12:34.921 --> 12:37.841
Hey, Peej, Peej, what's wrong?

12:37.924 --> 12:39.592
He's a broken boy,

12:39.676 --> 12:41.219
that's what's wrong.

12:41.302 --> 12:44.431
Given you the best years of his life,

12:44.514 --> 12:46.433
and look at him now.

12:46.516 --> 12:49.019
Can't you see he's only mortal?

12:49.144 --> 12:51.771
If you poke him with crayons,
will he not bleed?

12:51.855 --> 12:54.441
He's trying to be the best brother
in the world,

12:54.524 --> 12:57.318
but do you care? No!

12:57.819 --> 13:02.615
Soon as baby gets here,
you'll toss him away like used kleenex.

13:03.074 --> 13:05.243
Oh, the shame of it.

13:06.077 --> 13:07.537
There, there, Peej,

13:07.620 --> 13:09.080
I still love you.

13:09.164 --> 13:13.168
Heck, the baby might not even
be a boy.

13:13.251 --> 13:16.212
It might be a girl.

13:16.546 --> 13:17.547
A girl?

13:17.630 --> 13:18.465
Never thought of that.

13:20.216 --> 13:21.134
Yeah!

13:21.217 --> 13:22.635
Oh, yeah!

13:22.719 --> 13:24.220
Yay! Yay!

13:24.304 --> 13:26.139
Thank you. Thank you!

13:26.222 --> 13:27.974
Uh-oh.

13:28.058 --> 13:29.934
-Pistol.
-Do you know what you're saying?

13:30.018 --> 13:32.604
What if Mom and Dad
like her better than you?

13:32.687 --> 13:34.522
The kid'll swipe your best toys.

13:34.606 --> 13:37.192
Mom may never french braid
your hair again.

13:37.275 --> 13:40.862
You could end up in the basement
with the spiders, mold and fungus.

13:40.945 --> 13:43.114
Baloney!

13:43.198 --> 13:46.743
When it comes to babes,
I'm numero uno around here.

13:47.327 --> 13:49.037
[mumbling]

13:49.120 --> 13:50.663
Hey, what's the deal?

13:50.747 --> 13:52.415
Remodeling the room for baby.

13:52.540 --> 13:54.918
Got some swell ideas
for the little darlin'.

13:55.001 --> 14:00.256
I've been boning up on dr. Liverwurst's
Psychology of nursery decor.

14:00.340 --> 14:03.551
B-b-b-but where am I going to be?

14:04.302 --> 14:07.514
Think your dad said something about
sharing P.J.'s room.

14:07.597 --> 14:10.975
[both] Me... and you?

14:11.184 --> 14:13.645
Hey, Petey, Dr. Liverwurst here says

14:13.728 --> 14:17.482
the color can raise
your baby's IQ 140 points.

14:22.362 --> 14:25.532
Your kid's going to be a rocket scientist.

14:25.699 --> 14:27.951
We're doomed.

14:28.034 --> 14:30.704
Kiss half your Christmas presents
goodbye.

14:31.371 --> 14:35.542
Hmm. And I was extra special
good this year, too.

14:36.334 --> 14:37.752
Wait a minute!

14:37.836 --> 14:41.381
Are we gonna let some two-bit,
no-talent diaper soiler

14:41.464 --> 14:43.216
cramp our lifestyles?

14:43.299 --> 14:44.384
Probably.

14:44.467 --> 14:48.346
Come on, Peej. We got to convince Dad
we're all the kids he needs.

14:48.471 --> 14:49.889
You guys with me?

14:49.973 --> 14:52.475
[P.J. and Max] With you! Yeah!

15:01.776 --> 15:03.528
Huh?

15:03.862 --> 15:05.780
Here. Hold this down till I get back.

15:05.864 --> 15:08.533
Okey-dokey, Petey!

15:10.577 --> 15:11.703
Hmmm.

15:11.786 --> 15:12.829
What?

15:15.457 --> 15:18.793
"Snooky-wookums,
the baby came a little early,

15:18.877 --> 15:21.379
and I had to close a deal?

15:21.963 --> 15:26.593
Put our bundle of joy in the nursery
till I get home. Love and kisses, Peg."

15:26.676 --> 15:28.887
Aww, isn't that sweet?

15:28.970 --> 15:31.181
Don't need a baby. Got one coming.
Thanks anyway.

15:33.683 --> 15:35.060
Aah!

15:35.143 --> 15:36.853
[gurgling]

15:43.568 --> 15:46.946

15:47.030 --> 15:48.198
She wasn't kidding.

15:48.698 --> 15:51.326
A baby! A baby!

15:51.409 --> 15:54.871
Oh, cute little bugger, isn't he?

15:54.954 --> 15:56.081
Ow!

15:56.164 --> 15:59.626
Aw, sort of reminds me of P.J.

15:59.709 --> 16:01.294
back when he was cute.

16:01.461 --> 16:03.713
Kootchie-coo!

16:03.797 --> 16:05.090
Ow!

16:06.091 --> 16:09.219
Uh-oh. He must be hungry.

16:10.637 --> 16:12.305
Uh, yeah!

16:12.347 --> 16:15.517
Why don't we rustle him up some chow?

16:15.600 --> 16:18.937
Is da wittle baby hungry?

16:19.020 --> 16:20.188
Ha ha.

16:20.271 --> 16:23.650
Dada get da baby a nice big bottle.

16:23.733 --> 16:26.152
[Goofy] Ow! Hoo hoo!

16:26.903 --> 16:29.406
Here, give him a bottle. Goof?

16:32.826 --> 16:34.327
Whoa!

16:34.411 --> 16:35.787
Aah!

16:35.870 --> 16:36.788
Whoa!

16:36.871 --> 16:38.832
[Pete] Come back here!

16:38.915 --> 16:41.584
Dad, Dad, come quick!
It's baby!

16:43.628 --> 16:46.840
Oh, no, I can't believe it.
This ain't my day.

16:54.556 --> 16:55.640
[belches]

16:56.266 --> 16:58.143
Now, now,

16:58.226 --> 17:03.148
it's not nice to eat Daddy's
private stock of frozen pizza.

17:03.273 --> 17:07.360
Dada take his baby outside to play.

17:12.824 --> 17:14.784

17:19.873 --> 17:21.833

17:38.600 --> 17:42.354
I can't believe what a rotten,
lousy day I'm having.

17:42.437 --> 17:46.358
Well, congratulations, Dad.

17:46.441 --> 17:48.735
You got a bouncing
baby boy.

17:48.860 --> 17:51.112

18:06.002 --> 18:09.381

You're welcome, I guess. I don't know.

18:11.800 --> 18:14.135
Whee! [laughing]

18:19.891 --> 18:23.353
For crying out sakes,
what's with that kid?

18:23.436 --> 18:25.313
P.J. was never this bad.

18:25.397 --> 18:27.899
Isn't he wonderful?

18:27.982 --> 18:29.025
Isn't he swell?

18:29.109 --> 18:32.070
Wasn't having him such a good idea?

18:32.696 --> 18:35.532
No prob, Peej. I'll tell him.

18:35.949 --> 18:38.785
Mr. Pete, P.J.'s at the store

18:38.868 --> 18:41.955
getting a year's supply
of diapers, formula, and baby powder.

18:42.038 --> 18:43.456
You wanna come down and pay for it,

18:43.540 --> 18:46.334
or should he ask Peg for the 1,270 bucks?

18:46.584 --> 18:49.254
1,270 bu...

18:49.671 --> 18:52.298

before the nursery's finished!

19:34.215 --> 19:36.217
