00:12.600 --> 00:16.600
I'm Fred Sirieix. I've worked
in the restaurant industry
for 25 years.

00:16.640 --> 00:21.160
Right now,
the UK restaurant scene
is the envy of the world.

00:21.200 --> 00:27.400
And all it takes
is one great idea to make
a fortune on the high street.

00:27.440 --> 00:31.440
But has the next generation
of restaurants got
what it takes to become

00:31.480 --> 00:34.120
a multi-million pound business?

00:34.160 --> 00:38.720
Over the next six weeks,
here in Manchester,
the food capital of the North,

00:38.760 --> 00:41.560
Twelve of the most exciting
new restaurant ideas

00:41.600 --> 00:44.320
are in for the chance
of a life changing investment

00:44.360 --> 00:47.960
from some of the UK's
most respected investors.

00:48.000 --> 00:52.920
These are the men and women
who can turn an idea
into a national brand.

00:52.960 --> 00:57.040
We're looking at
putting a lot of money
into the absolute best concept.

00:57.080 --> 00:59.200
This is the kind of model
that you dream of.

00:59.240 --> 01:02.400
If I find the right operator,
I'll be fighting for it.

01:05.200 --> 01:07.840
[Fred] Each week,
the investors
will give the people

01:07.880 --> 01:10.960
behind two great
new food ideas
a unique opportunity.

01:11.000 --> 01:12.440
Ah, this is really it.

01:12.480 --> 01:15.120
-[Fred]
Their own pop-up restaurant.
-[bell dings]

01:15.160 --> 01:16.560
Right. Rock and roll, man.

01:16.600 --> 01:18.200
[Fred]
They'll have just three days
to prove...

01:18.240 --> 01:20.040
Nobody seems to know
their table numbers.

01:20.080 --> 01:22.440
-[Fred]
They've got what it takes...
-It's a disaster.

01:22.480 --> 01:24.240
[Fred] ...to make it
on the high street.

01:24.280 --> 01:27.120
When you start to rush,
that's when you start
to make more mistakes.

01:27.160 --> 01:29.080
-There's a big backlog
of customers...
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:29.120 --> 01:30.680
What are you gonna do about it?

01:30.720 --> 01:34.920
If I was to invest,
it'll take half a million
to £750,000.

01:34.960 --> 01:35.880
Time to make some dough.

01:37.000 --> 01:38.760
[Fred]
After the three days,

01:38.800 --> 01:41.520
will the investors
walk back
into the restaurants...

01:41.560 --> 01:42.800
[sighing]

01:42.840 --> 01:44.480
[Fred]
...and make them an offer?

01:44.520 --> 01:46.440
It's a £600,000 launch.

01:46.480 --> 01:49.200
We are not going to leave
without an investment.

01:49.240 --> 01:51.200
I'm sorry.
Your time is up.

01:51.240 --> 01:53.080
The doors
are open for business.

01:53.120 --> 01:54.520
Welcome to Million Pound Menu.

02:02.880 --> 02:06.320
Over 1300 restaurants opened
last year in the UK.

02:06.360 --> 02:08.680
Today, two more
will be open for business,

02:08.720 --> 02:12.680
hoping they've got
what it takes to make a fortune
in the restaurant business.

02:12.720 --> 02:15.280
[narrator]
Times might be challenging
on the high street,

02:15.320 --> 02:19.640
but chains based on
strong, simple concepts
can still make money.

02:19.680 --> 02:24.080
And investors are on the hunt
for new opportunities.

02:24.120 --> 02:27.560
These are my amazing,
delicious, East Asian
small plates.

02:27.600 --> 02:29.560
Perfect for sharing
with your mates.

02:29.600 --> 02:31.960
[narrator] The men and women
behind some of the most
successful businesses

02:32.000 --> 02:33.320
on the high street...

02:33.360 --> 02:35.080
The plot to our mission
is quite simple.

02:35.120 --> 02:37.400
We want to serve
the best clucking wings
in town.

02:37.440 --> 02:40.360
[narrator] ...met to choose
some of the best
new restaurant ideas

02:40.400 --> 02:42.320
for a three-day
dry run pop-up.

02:42.360 --> 02:43.720
So what is a bunzel?

02:43.760 --> 02:46.600
A bunzel is a cross
between a bun and a pretzel.

02:46.640 --> 02:48.360
[narrator]
They were looking
for the two entrepreneurs

02:48.400 --> 02:50.720
with the strongest food, brand,
and business plan.

02:50.760 --> 02:53.880
We've done eight pop-up events
and they sold out
within 12 hours.

02:53.920 --> 02:56.680
There's an explosion
of these concepts.

02:56.720 --> 02:58.840
I would eat this happily
all day every day.

02:58.880 --> 03:02.480
[narrator] Then each investor
had to decide whether
they liked the concept enough

03:02.520 --> 03:03.840
to try it in Manchester.

03:04.480 --> 03:06.760
My food is exciting.

03:06.800 --> 03:09.280
[narrator]
The first idea to get
the investors' attention

03:09.320 --> 03:11.600
is one of the most original
they've heard.

03:11.640 --> 03:14.720
My name is Prince.
I'm the founder of
Trap Kitchen,

03:14.760 --> 03:19.000
the exotic food company.

03:19.040 --> 03:20.800
[narrator]
Trap Kitchen's owner,
Prince,

03:20.840 --> 03:25.480
runs a seafood
takeaway business
from his mom's London flat.

03:25.520 --> 03:29.840
[Prince] We like to mix
and match with waffles
and chicken...

03:29.880 --> 03:31.560
This is what the people want.

03:31.600 --> 03:35.640
The food is very nice
and I'm surprised.

03:35.680 --> 03:39.360
[narrator]
Trap Kitchen has 43,000
social media fans.

03:39.400 --> 03:42.160
[Prince] We serve
250 customers a day.

03:42.200 --> 03:47.360
[narrator] And now Prince wants
half a million pounds
to start his first restaurant.

03:47.400 --> 03:50.240
It'll be a great opportunity
for anybody who wants
to get involved.

03:50.280 --> 03:51.440
Chicken. Six chicken.

03:51.480 --> 03:53.680
My mom wants me out.
[laughs]

03:56.160 --> 03:57.920
Having this kind
of passion coming through

03:57.960 --> 04:00.400
from young entrepreneurs
is absolutely vital.

04:00.440 --> 04:03.480
To take it to the next level,
it does need somebody

04:03.520 --> 04:05.440
nurturing and building
a team around him.

04:05.480 --> 04:07.520
[Scott]
I think this is amazing,
first and foremost,

04:07.560 --> 04:09.520
because he has 40,000
Instagram followers

04:09.560 --> 04:10.960
and he's built it
purely on that,

04:11.000 --> 04:13.120
so it's very of the moment.

04:13.160 --> 04:16.280
I'm Scott Collins, co-founder
and managing director
of MEATLiquor.

04:16.320 --> 04:20.680
What Prince is achieving
out of his family home
sort of beggars belief.

04:20.720 --> 04:23.280
Reckons he turns over
£10,000 a week.

04:23.320 --> 04:26.400
And he only
serves three days,
which is extraordinary.

04:26.440 --> 04:28.680
It's what other people
are trying to be.

04:28.720 --> 04:32.040
They're trying to be grungy
and edgy and urban
and gritty...

04:32.080 --> 04:35.800
I think this is far removed
from, sort of corporate
activity as possible,

04:35.840 --> 04:37.920
which I quite like.

04:37.960 --> 04:41.280
My name is David Page
and I'm an investor
in restaurants.

04:41.320 --> 04:45.520
I've rarely seen anything
so unstructured
as Trap Kitchen.

04:45.560 --> 04:48.400
Unstructured,
but also massively popular.

04:48.440 --> 04:52.080
At the moment, there is
a massive demand
for new ideas,

04:52.120 --> 04:54.480
but the economic situation
has plummeted.

04:54.520 --> 04:58.400
Only the really good ideas
will survive and thrive.

04:58.440 --> 05:02.360
It's a fantastic idea
and I'm just behind Scott.

05:03.240 --> 05:05.240
-I'm Lee.
-And I'm Faai.

05:05.280 --> 05:07.040
We're Greedy Khao.

05:07.080 --> 05:10.360
[narrator] Next,
a married couple
with their big idea

05:10.400 --> 05:12.680
for the lucrative
lunchtime market.

05:12.720 --> 05:16.040
-We want to be number one
for vegan Thai food in the UK.
-Yeah.

05:16.080 --> 05:18.200
[Faai] Quite a number
of customers
who told me

05:18.240 --> 05:22.440
that my curries taste better
than what they've, you know,
had in Thailand.

05:22.480 --> 05:25.480
[narrator]
Greedy Khao want £225,000

05:25.520 --> 05:26.960
to help them
conquer the high street.

05:27.000 --> 05:28.320
Thank you very much.
Enjoy.

05:28.360 --> 05:29.920
[Lee] Think of
somewhere like Leon,

05:29.960 --> 05:32.720
so we're talking
about quick service
but high quality.

05:32.760 --> 05:34.240
Give that one
for your first try.

05:34.280 --> 05:38.400
We want a chain, we want
to be on every major hub
in the UK.

05:40.320 --> 05:42.880
So I was really quite excited
by Greedy Khao.

05:42.920 --> 05:45.000
The first thing
that jumped out to me
was the branding,

05:45.040 --> 05:47.960
which is very bold
and exciting.

05:48.000 --> 05:49.680
My name is Chris Miller.

05:49.720 --> 05:53.400
I am the managing director
of a company called
White Rabbit Fund.

05:53.440 --> 05:58.400
There is so much competition
fighting for your
lunchtime money

05:58.440 --> 06:02.440
that you need something
really strong and really bold
that jumps out at you.

06:02.480 --> 06:04.840
There is this big pink cow,

06:04.880 --> 06:07.960
it's vegan-led
which we know
is a growing market...

06:08.000 --> 06:09.560
But if you look
at something like Pret...

06:09.600 --> 06:11.640
Pret has opened
veggie sites,

06:11.680 --> 06:14.400
um, but they've only done
three in 18 months.

06:14.440 --> 06:16.280
-Is it a niche?
-It is quite niche

06:16.320 --> 06:19.720
in the sense that you not only
have to be wanting Thai food,

06:19.760 --> 06:21.960
you also have to be
wanting something vegan.

06:22.000 --> 06:25.160
I would very happily go
and see them and experience it.

06:25.200 --> 06:28.880
I think the profit
could be very positive here.

06:28.920 --> 06:30.920
[narrator]
Two ideas have been chosen.

06:30.960 --> 06:34.480
They're both takeaways
who want to set up
as a grab and go chain.

06:35.760 --> 06:37.960
Greedy Khao's hopes
rest on one man,

06:38.000 --> 06:41.400
but two investors could end up
fighting over Trap Kitchen.

06:56.680 --> 06:59.640
Greedy Khao and Trap Kitchen
now have to convince
the investors

06:59.680 --> 07:01.440
they're worth the investment.

07:01.480 --> 07:03.840
This opportunity
may never happen again.

07:03.880 --> 07:06.360
The clock is ticking.

07:06.400 --> 07:09.840
For the next three days,
they'll take over
existing restaurant sites

07:09.880 --> 07:12.480
just 100 yards apart.

07:12.520 --> 07:15.160
Today, Lee, Faai and Prince

07:15.200 --> 07:18.880
are about to see
their new restaurants
for the very first time.

07:18.920 --> 07:22.320
My mamma's kitchen,
it's actually here.

07:22.360 --> 07:25.320
[narrator] Over the last month,
they've been working
with a designer

07:25.360 --> 07:27.400
to bring
their restaurant brand to life.

07:27.440 --> 07:29.200
Ah, this is brilliant.

07:29.240 --> 07:30.800
I'm gonna walk in there
like it's mine

07:30.840 --> 07:33.920
and I've been doing it
for millions of years.

07:33.960 --> 07:35.720
This is the future.

07:35.760 --> 07:38.400
I've never even seen
one of these before.
What is this?

07:38.440 --> 07:39.840
[laughs]

07:42.120 --> 07:43.200
Hello.

07:43.240 --> 07:44.600
[narrator]
Twenty-seven year-old Prince

07:44.640 --> 07:46.600
lives with his parents
in Camberwell, South London.

07:46.640 --> 07:48.280
Yes, it is dialing. I can help.

07:48.320 --> 07:50.720
[narrator]
A year ago, he started
posting pictures of the food

07:50.760 --> 07:52.760
he was making
in his mom's kitchen,

07:52.800 --> 07:57.600
and discovered people were
prepared to pay up to £20
a dish for his food.

07:57.640 --> 08:00.320
Growing up, I started
hanging around
with a lot of people

08:00.360 --> 08:04.520
who were very business minded,
but not in the right way.

08:04.560 --> 08:08.760
What I did was take the game
of buying for cheap,
selling for more

08:08.800 --> 08:12.360
market, advertise,
and try to get as much
customers as you can.

08:12.400 --> 08:17.920
It was only right
I use my talent, which
was obviously cooking,

08:17.960 --> 08:21.880
to infuse it with the
business mind that I gathered
from when I was young.

08:21.920 --> 08:25.840
[narrator] Now, Prince puts
his menu up on social media
three days a week,

08:25.880 --> 08:29.520
and the queues form
for his spicy seafood
meal boxes.

08:30.800 --> 08:32.120
Hello.

08:32.160 --> 08:34.120
Now, what you've gotta do
is make your way here.

08:34.160 --> 08:36.040
When you get here,
somebody will be outside
to take your order, brother.

08:36.080 --> 08:38.880
[narrator]
Customers park outside
Prince's block of flats

08:38.920 --> 08:41.840
and his friends then
deliver the food.

08:41.880 --> 08:46.080
Sometimes you get
this whole row there
just full of cars to the point

08:46.120 --> 08:49.480
where some people
who do live in the residence
can't find parking.

08:49.520 --> 08:52.360
So what they will do
is call the council
and the council will send

08:52.400 --> 08:53.640
their parking enforcers around.

08:55.640 --> 08:57.720
We definitely need to move on.

08:57.760 --> 08:59.520
We need to get
a permanent restaurant.

08:59.560 --> 09:01.400
Like Nandos,
you know what I mean?
That's it.

09:01.440 --> 09:03.320
When I go to sleep
and I dream
about Trap Kitchen,

09:03.360 --> 09:04.480
that's how I see it.

09:07.200 --> 09:09.800
[narrator]
Prince believes his food
is the next big thing,

09:09.840 --> 09:13.760
and wants up to
£500,000 for his
first restaurant.

09:15.440 --> 09:18.440
The masses out there
are tired. [laughs]

09:18.480 --> 09:20.080
We just want...
We want something new.

09:20.120 --> 09:23.800
And I feel like
I've created a formula.
I've got the sauce.

09:23.840 --> 09:25.440
[laughs]

09:28.840 --> 09:30.880
[narrator]
Opposite Trap Kitchen,
Lee and Faai

09:30.920 --> 09:34.960
are also about
to see their restaurant
for the first time.

09:35.000 --> 09:37.360
-Oh, wow.
-It's large. [laughs]

09:37.400 --> 09:38.960
Check this out.

09:39.000 --> 09:41.800
We are very excited
but also scared.

09:41.840 --> 09:43.880
Is there a word
for that? [laughs]

09:43.920 --> 09:45.240
Exciticared?

09:45.280 --> 09:46.720
Oh, look at this.

09:48.960 --> 09:51.040
It is much more beautiful
than I thought.

09:51.080 --> 09:53.040
Yeah, it is.

09:53.080 --> 09:54.880
[narrator] The couple met
at university,

09:54.920 --> 09:58.320
where Lee fell in love
with Faai and her cooking.

09:58.360 --> 10:00.840
[Lee] I did not like Thai food
until I met Faai.

10:00.880 --> 10:03.360
When she cooked for me
the first time,
I was just blown away.

10:03.400 --> 10:05.520
I was like, "This is,
this is what I'm missing."

10:07.640 --> 10:09.320
[narrator]
Last year, the newlyweds

10:09.360 --> 10:12.520
gave up their jobs to set up
a food stall in London.

10:13.120 --> 10:14.960
Here you go. Enjoy.

10:15.000 --> 10:18.160
Faai could be living
quite an easy life in Thailand

10:18.200 --> 10:21.240
with a really well-paid job,
but instead,
here she is with me...

10:21.280 --> 10:23.920
-Lifting things...
-...hauling crap in and out
of the van.

10:23.960 --> 10:27.960
[Faai] My family is genuinely
very surprised
we're here today,

10:28.000 --> 10:32.760
because they just don't
see me as a business person.
Never. [laughs]

10:32.800 --> 10:35.880
I grew up, like,
a very spoiled child.

10:35.920 --> 10:39.080
I'm just happy to be here.
Just to prove them wrong.

10:39.120 --> 10:42.760
[narrator] Lee and Faai
want £225,000
of investment

10:42.800 --> 10:46.040
so they can put a Greedy Khao
on the high street

10:46.080 --> 10:48.800
and start sharing
in the 20 billion pounds a year

10:48.840 --> 10:51.400
Britain spends
on grab-and-go food.

10:51.440 --> 10:55.440
In five years we see ourselves
with five stalls in London

10:55.480 --> 10:59.880
and maybe in other major city
in the UK as well.

11:07.160 --> 11:11.400
This is about five times
the amount of space
we usually work with.

11:11.440 --> 11:13.320
At least.

11:13.360 --> 11:17.160
[narrator] In just 24 hours,
the investors will be
arriving for lunch.

11:17.200 --> 11:19.560
We need to get
everything ready,

11:19.600 --> 11:24.680
so come service,
we'll be fine,
we will not panic.

11:24.720 --> 11:29.960
[Fred] So tonight, they open
to the Manchester public
for a practice run.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.920
These are exciting time
for Greedy Khao
and Trap Kitchen.

11:32.960 --> 11:34.720
They are getting ready
for their soft launch,

11:34.760 --> 11:37.480
their first night
as a real restaurant.

11:37.520 --> 11:41.640
It's their one chance
to try their concept out
before the investors arrive.

11:41.680 --> 11:43.440
[narrator]
Greedy Khao and Trap Kitchen

11:43.480 --> 11:45.840
have each brought
core staff with them.

11:45.880 --> 11:49.120
This is the way that I need
to do things to get it going
when it's busy.

11:49.160 --> 11:51.520
[narrator] But Prince
is the only one cooking.

11:51.560 --> 11:56.160
He's keeping his team,
including friend Zair,
out of the kitchen.

11:56.200 --> 11:58.800
He doesn't need anyone
in the kitchen with him,

11:58.840 --> 12:00.800
'cause he feels that
he can get
everything done.

12:00.840 --> 12:04.120
You see, when you're
driving a car, you can't be
doing 80 miles on the motorway

12:04.160 --> 12:07.160
and be like, uh,
"Let's swap over."

12:07.200 --> 12:08.520
You see what I'm saying?

12:08.560 --> 12:10.240
That's not how it works, so...

12:11.320 --> 12:14.240
Right now, I'm driving.

12:14.280 --> 12:17.080
-Morning. How are you, Prince?
-I'm okay, I'm fine, thank you.

12:17.120 --> 12:19.120
-I'm Fred, nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you too.

12:19.160 --> 12:21.200
I had a look this morning
at your Instagram.

12:21.240 --> 12:23.040
-Yeah.
-You got 43,000.

12:23.080 --> 12:24.840
Yeah, imagine that.

12:24.880 --> 12:27.760
Established brand
would kill to have such
a penetration in the market.

12:27.800 --> 12:31.200
How do you start to cook
in your mom's kitchen
in a council flat...

12:31.240 --> 12:33.480
-Yeah.
-...and get such a following?

12:33.520 --> 12:36.320
How did you...
What was the moment
that you started?

12:36.360 --> 12:42.680
Um, well, I used to cook
and put it on
my social media platform

12:42.720 --> 12:44.640
and people
just started requesting that.

12:44.680 --> 12:46.600
"Ah, is that for sale."
Then people would just
be like,

12:46.640 --> 12:48.520
-"That looks very nice."
-I've done that before

12:48.560 --> 12:50.080
and nobody wanted
to buy my food.

12:50.120 --> 12:51.680
I was... I just had the...

12:51.720 --> 12:54.960
I had the flick of the wrist.
I had the magic in the wrist.

12:55.000 --> 13:00.440
Once you stick your fork
in one of those prawns
and then you taste it,

13:00.480 --> 13:03.440
I mean, that garlic butter,
it will be dancing
all over your tongue.

13:03.480 --> 13:05.120
I'm looking forward
to trying it.
Good luck.

13:05.160 --> 13:06.600
-Thank you very much.
-Thank you, Prince.

13:09.800 --> 13:11.440
[Prince] I kind of
taught myself to cook.

13:11.480 --> 13:13.480
We live in an age
of information, right?

13:13.520 --> 13:16.960
I've seen people
build robots from YouTube.

13:17.000 --> 13:19.800
You see what I'm saying?
So once I attained
the knowledge of it,

13:19.840 --> 13:22.560
I just thought, yeah,
got to crack on.

13:24.440 --> 13:27.280
[narrator]
Prince has expanded
his usual Trap Kitchen menu

13:27.320 --> 13:29.880
for his first night
as a restaurant.

13:29.920 --> 13:32.720
Cajun-fried chicken
is ten pounds,

13:32.760 --> 13:35.880
lobster tail and prawns
is £15,

13:35.920 --> 13:41.400
and his famous Baller's Combo,
shellfish and chicken together,
is £20.

13:46.200 --> 13:47.480
Are those sized too small?

13:48.000 --> 13:49.600
They look good.

13:49.640 --> 13:52.880
[narrator]
In Greedy Khao, many
of Lee and Faai's vegan dishes

13:52.920 --> 13:54.760
are based on meat substitutes

13:54.800 --> 13:57.120
like tofu and seitan.

13:57.160 --> 13:59.960
They want Greedy Khao
to be the new lunchtime option

14:00.000 --> 14:03.960
for the one in three people
in the UK who say they want
to cut down on meat.

14:04.000 --> 14:06.440
I'm battering our chicken.

14:06.480 --> 14:08.880
That's a protein
derived from the soy plant.

14:08.920 --> 14:12.520
It's shaped and textured
in such a way that it kind of
resembles chicken.

14:13.920 --> 14:16.360
Morning, how are you?
I'm Fred.

14:16.400 --> 14:17.640
-Lee.
-You okay?

14:17.680 --> 14:19.440
So tell me
about your brand.

14:19.480 --> 14:21.840
I mean, the Greedy Khao,
is there an appetite

14:21.880 --> 14:25.480
on the high street for a pure,
vegan-Thai restaurant?

14:25.520 --> 14:27.960
[Lee] But when you look out
at the sort of, overall trends

14:28.000 --> 14:31.400
that are going on at
the moment, if you look
at the number of people

14:31.440 --> 14:34.720
that are looking
to reduce the amount of meat
and dairy that they consume,

14:34.760 --> 14:37.760
-it's huge.
-What is your actual vision
for your brand?

14:37.800 --> 14:40.040
Where does Greedy Khao
sit in the market?

14:40.080 --> 14:41.880
We think it's something
like Leon.

14:41.920 --> 14:44.680
You go in, you order
at the counter,
you've got nice bright menus

14:44.720 --> 14:46.200
just up above you,

14:46.240 --> 14:48.000
you wait for your food
and you go sit down
or you leave,

14:48.040 --> 14:49.040
whatever you want to do.

14:49.080 --> 14:50.520
That fast food format,

14:50.560 --> 14:52.360
it's a bit more like what we
currently do at the moment.

14:52.400 --> 14:55.560
You have a very clear vision
for your brand,
it's really good to see.

14:55.600 --> 14:57.120
Thank you,
lovely day to you.

14:57.160 --> 14:58.360
Take care,
nice to meet you too.

14:58.400 --> 15:01.120
-Cheers.
-Thank you.

15:01.160 --> 15:05.360
[narrator] Greedy Khao's menu
features Thai classics
with a vegan twist.

15:05.400 --> 15:09.280
Their red curry features
seitan instead of chicken.

15:09.320 --> 15:12.600
Khao Soi, a richly spiced
noodle soup
from North Thailand,

15:12.640 --> 15:15.320
replaces chicken with tofu.

15:15.360 --> 15:18.120
Both are £7.95.

15:18.160 --> 15:23.240
And their spiced fritters
are £4.95, with corn
instead of prawns.

15:28.440 --> 15:32.840
It's 5:30 p.m.
Doors open in two hours.

15:32.880 --> 15:34.200
Welcome to Greedy Khao.

15:34.240 --> 15:35.720
-I'm Dinesh.
-Lee.

15:35.760 --> 15:38.040
-Nice to meet you, Prince.
-Hi, nice to meet you too.

15:38.080 --> 15:39.960
[narrator]
Greedy Khao
and Trap Kitchen

15:40.000 --> 15:43.280
are joined by two experienced
local waiting staff.

15:43.320 --> 15:45.960
-Are you excited?
-Yeah, definitely, yeah.

15:46.000 --> 15:48.440
[narrator] And both restaurants
are holding a staff briefing

15:48.480 --> 15:51.600
to let their teams know
how they want service
to run.

15:51.640 --> 15:55.960
To run a restaurant
successfully is very difficult
because it relies on staff.

15:56.000 --> 15:58.600
So what restaurants must do
is inspire their staff

15:58.640 --> 16:01.000
so that when they serve
their guests,
they do so

16:01.040 --> 16:04.560
by sharing the vision
and the values of your brand.

16:04.600 --> 16:07.880
So, hello, welcome
to Greedy Khao.

16:07.920 --> 16:11.600
Rather than your sort of
usual Thai restaurants
in the UK,

16:11.640 --> 16:14.080
which gives a very, sort of,
fussy experience,

16:14.120 --> 16:18.760
we're about is making it
vibrant and fun, bursting with
color and flavor...

16:18.800 --> 16:24.640
So today, obviously we're going
to open and we're going to
serve real customers.

16:25.520 --> 16:27.040
And... [laughs]

16:27.080 --> 16:30.640
And... Who's excited?
You excited?
Is everyone here excited?

16:30.680 --> 16:31.840
That's good.

16:31.880 --> 16:33.920
The way we figure
it's gonna work tonight...

16:33.960 --> 16:36.240
Leo is going to be
talking to customers,

16:36.280 --> 16:39.360
as guys come in,
he's gonna be welcoming them,
showing them to their seats.

16:39.400 --> 16:41.000
You two guys
are going to be taking orders

16:41.040 --> 16:44.400
and running the food
to and from the tables.

16:44.440 --> 16:48.760
Basically, we've never
done it in an actual,
live restaurant before.

16:48.800 --> 16:51.360
If anyone here is feeling
not confident,

16:51.400 --> 16:53.320
I'm in the same boat
as you guys.

16:53.360 --> 16:54.920
You see what I'm saying?
[laughs]

16:54.960 --> 16:57.720
[Fred]
Prince is a very enthusiastic
and positive guy.

16:57.760 --> 17:01.440
But in his briefing tonight,
he wasn't really precise
or detailed enough.

17:01.480 --> 17:03.520
People need to know
what their jobs are.

17:03.560 --> 17:06.120
They need to know
what they do and how
they're gonna do it.

17:06.160 --> 17:08.400
Is he going to survive?
That's my question.

17:19.720 --> 17:22.360
Good evening, guys,
welcome to Greedy Khao.

17:22.400 --> 17:25.160
[narrator] 7:30 p.m.
The doors are open.

17:25.200 --> 17:27.360
Hi. Welcome to Trap Kitchen.

17:27.400 --> 17:31.640
[narrator] Tonight, these two
takeaways become restaurants
for the first time.

17:31.680 --> 17:33.120
[Leo] Good evening, guys.

17:33.160 --> 17:35.120
Hi, welcome to Greedy Khao.

17:35.160 --> 17:38.600
It's Saturday night
in Manchester and people
are out for a good time.

17:38.640 --> 17:40.120
And good food.

17:40.160 --> 17:43.440
The first night
of a restaurant
can be very difficult.

17:43.480 --> 17:47.720
What I want to know,
will they sink,
or will they swim?

17:47.760 --> 17:49.480
-So we want one of everything.
-Yeah.

17:49.520 --> 17:50.840
Is this table big enough?

17:50.880 --> 17:53.120
[woman]
We'll make it big enough.
We'll survive.

17:53.160 --> 17:56.240
We need Jackfruit Laab,
we need a classic red curry,
we need a Khao soi.

17:57.480 --> 17:59.680
-Yes, Chef.
-Yes, Chef.

17:59.720 --> 18:02.840
-They both want
Baller's Combos...
-Hi, how are you doing?

18:02.880 --> 18:05.160
Do you want something sweet?
It's sweet waffle.

18:05.200 --> 18:08.160
It's getting a bit busy
but I'm calm.

18:08.200 --> 18:10.880
-You know what? I want
two Baller's Combos.
-You want two? Oh.

18:10.920 --> 18:12.400
That's two whole meals,
by the way.

18:12.440 --> 18:15.720
I've never had it before.
I've just seen it on Instagram.

18:15.760 --> 18:19.280
Trap Kitchen is full tonight.
And it is only because of that.

18:19.320 --> 18:21.680
Prince puts one picture
of his food a day

18:21.720 --> 18:23.280
and thousands
of people see them.

18:23.320 --> 18:25.680
And thousands more
wants to come and eat his food.

18:25.720 --> 18:27.320
This is the power
of social media.

18:29.360 --> 18:31.400
So are you also just having
the Baller's Combo?

18:31.440 --> 18:33.320
Yes. I'm gonna get
two sides, yes.

18:33.360 --> 18:36.200
You know the name
when you hear it.
Trap Kitchen, Oh, yeah, London.

18:36.240 --> 18:38.880
Heard that these guys
were having an opening,

18:38.920 --> 18:40.200
and I was like,
"I've got to come."

18:40.240 --> 18:41.720
[woman] It's like supporting
your best mate.

18:41.760 --> 18:43.520
You don't know
the guy personally
but you wish him well,

18:43.560 --> 18:45.440
you want him to do well,
it's a nice concept.

18:45.480 --> 18:47.120
You like the food,
you like where it's come from.

18:47.160 --> 18:48.680
It's authentic, it's genuine.

18:48.720 --> 18:50.320
I've got to literally do
all of these ones,

18:50.360 --> 18:52.280
-and then do all of these ones.
-Oh, is this what you're doing?

18:52.320 --> 18:53.680
Yeah, that's
what I'm doing now.

18:53.720 --> 18:55.560
-So Baller's...
-So which one have you
just done?

18:55.600 --> 18:57.840
[Prince]
Well, I'm so confused, bro.

18:57.880 --> 19:01.320
[narrator]
An hour into service,
Prince is under pressure.

19:01.360 --> 19:04.720
He's not used to
getting multiple orders
to different tables.

19:04.760 --> 19:09.680
Yeah, I've gotta, kind of,
create my own system
of taking the orders.

19:09.720 --> 19:11.560
Because this one's
confusing as hell.

19:11.600 --> 19:13.360
These are going cold, yeah.

19:13.400 --> 19:16.000
That's been sat there
for a while. Now we've got
the hot plates for.

19:16.040 --> 19:18.720
Just make sure
when you're doing
your check back

19:18.760 --> 19:21.320
because it might have
gotten cold, it's been there
for quite some time.

19:21.360 --> 19:22.760
Okay.

19:22.800 --> 19:24.800
I just got, uh...
Take an order
and I'll come and get...

19:24.840 --> 19:26.960
You got people over there,
they're waiting.

19:27.000 --> 19:28.360
We're absolutely starving.

19:28.400 --> 19:30.480
Absolutely famished.

19:30.520 --> 19:33.920
So, yeah, looking forward
to the food coming up.
Very, very much.

19:33.960 --> 19:37.000
We've got a new set
of service coming
in 20 minutes,

19:37.040 --> 19:39.480
which means
that every single diner
in this restaurant

19:39.520 --> 19:41.920
-has to be out
in 20 minutes.
-[laughs]

19:41.960 --> 19:43.200
Yeah, so...

19:43.240 --> 19:45.840
I'm gonna have to
probably bring someone in...

19:45.880 --> 19:47.000
In here to help me.

19:47.040 --> 19:48.440
-Right.
-Emmanuel.

19:48.480 --> 19:49.760
We're gonna let them
take care of it,

19:49.800 --> 19:51.440
you come in here
and help me.

19:51.480 --> 19:54.000
Just gimme two seconds,
and I'm gonna
get you guys sorted, yeah?

19:54.040 --> 19:57.360
This is worse than
actual Trap Kitchen
at home.

19:57.400 --> 19:59.240
-What do you think?
-What do you mean,
it's worse?

19:59.280 --> 20:03.440
-Like, it's more...
Yeah.
-Pressure. Yeah.

20:03.480 --> 20:05.720
-But pressure
makes diamonds, baby.
-Exactly.

20:07.280 --> 20:10.440
-So this is
table number nine.
-Yeah.

20:10.480 --> 20:14.560
[narrator] Across the way,
vegan Thai is proving
just as popular

20:14.600 --> 20:17.880
with the Saturday night crowd
in Manchester.

20:17.920 --> 20:19.640
-That's really nice.
-That is actually tasty.

20:19.680 --> 20:21.280
You're obviously
having the wrong thing,

20:21.320 --> 20:23.840
'cause that really
does taste like chicken.

20:23.880 --> 20:27.320
-Okay, the corn.
-Thank you.

20:27.360 --> 20:28.920
-How are you?
-Hello.

20:28.960 --> 20:30.280
-You doing all right?
-Yeah, we're doing well.

20:32.560 --> 20:34.040
How are you, Faai?

20:34.080 --> 20:35.440
Doing very well.

20:35.480 --> 20:37.200
So this is where
the magic happens.

20:37.240 --> 20:39.240
[Faai] Yeah...
[Fred] It's brilliant.

20:39.280 --> 20:41.080
-Yeah, the red curry is...
-[Fred] It's all ready?

20:41.120 --> 20:43.880
-All you have to do
is put it in the bowl?
-Yes.

20:43.920 --> 20:46.480
Because
when we do street food,
most of the time

20:46.520 --> 20:48.760
we just don't have time
with service to do anything.

20:48.800 --> 20:50.360
[Fred] No, of course.

20:50.400 --> 20:52.600
Which is why
we tend to have everything
ready from the start.

20:52.640 --> 20:55.120
-You can't get it wrong.
-No.

20:55.160 --> 20:58.040
[Fred] I really can't believe
this is the first night
they've opened Greedy Khao.

20:58.080 --> 20:59.240
It's so smooth.

20:59.280 --> 21:01.040
Faai is gliding
in the kitchen.

21:01.080 --> 21:03.360
The staff are relaxed
and they've got the time
to do their job

21:03.400 --> 21:05.280
and talk to the customers.
It's brilliant.

21:05.320 --> 21:08.320
I haven't seen a vegan place
that's Thai before,

21:08.360 --> 21:10.840
so there's definitely
a demand for it, I think.

21:10.880 --> 21:13.640
I just want them to get
the investment so that
I can come to the restaurant.

21:13.680 --> 21:16.480
We might be going
somewhere after
for a bit of meat.

21:16.520 --> 21:18.560
-But no, it was lovely.
-[laughs]

21:23.840 --> 21:25.720
So this one here's ready.

21:25.760 --> 21:29.600
[narrator] Half-past 9:00.
Now Prince has accepted
help in the kitchen,

21:29.640 --> 21:32.480
customers are getting
the Trap experience.

21:32.520 --> 21:33.760
Now that's weird.

21:35.000 --> 21:36.200
That's a sweet waffle.

21:39.360 --> 21:40.600
How's the food? You like it?

21:40.640 --> 21:43.760
The spice and the
actual taste itself is lovely.

21:43.800 --> 21:45.720
Just need to ask you.
How's the food?

21:45.760 --> 21:47.800
-Really, really good.
-Yeah. Really, really nice.

21:47.840 --> 21:49.200
What do you like about it?

21:49.240 --> 21:51.360
Such good,
kind of spicy flavor.

21:53.760 --> 21:56.040
[Fred] This menu is like
nothing I've seen before.

21:56.080 --> 21:59.440
It's got lobster, prawns,
chicken, macaroni cheese,

21:59.480 --> 22:03.760
mashed potato,
sweet Belgian waffles
on the same plate.

22:03.800 --> 22:06.160
It makes absolutely
no sense to me.

22:06.200 --> 22:07.840
But what do I know?

22:07.880 --> 22:10.800
For these guys,
it's haute cuisine
for the Instagram generation.

22:12.360 --> 22:14.280
[Prince] There's always
gonna be mistakes made.

22:14.320 --> 22:16.040
It's just about
getting the hang of it

22:16.080 --> 22:19.160
and being able to,
kind of, like,
I don't know, get better.

22:19.200 --> 22:21.240
This is our first time.
I think we've
done pretty well

22:21.280 --> 22:23.600
for our first time
in a live restaurant,
to be honest with you.

22:23.640 --> 22:27.960
Our self-esteem is really high
and we've kept the pressure
under control.

22:28.000 --> 22:30.120
So we just gotta
get crackin'.

22:30.440 --> 22:32.440
[laughs]

22:46.360 --> 22:48.880
It's not every day
that one meal
could change your life.

22:48.920 --> 22:52.560
But that's the reality
for Lee, Faai, and Prince.

22:52.600 --> 22:55.560
The investors
are coming in today
to try the food.

22:55.600 --> 22:59.720
Greedy Khao and Trap Kitchen
are one mouthful away
from realizing their dreams.

23:00.720 --> 23:01.680
[Lee] Better.

23:02.520 --> 23:04.520
Better doesn't mean good.

23:04.560 --> 23:07.680
That means very good.
But I can't wait to taste it
with all those other flavors.

23:09.200 --> 23:13.840
This is one of
the most important meals
I've ever made.

23:13.880 --> 23:16.600
[narrator]
At Trap Kitchen,
Prince has already prepared

23:16.640 --> 23:19.000
two Baller's Combos
for the investors.

23:19.040 --> 23:20.760
You're excited, Emmanuel?

23:20.800 --> 23:21.920
-Excited for you.
-Yeah?

23:21.960 --> 23:23.480
How are you feeling today?

23:23.520 --> 23:24.960
The question is,
how're you feeling?

23:25.000 --> 23:26.360
'Cause it's your big day.

23:26.400 --> 23:28.040
[narrator]
And today means
more to Prince

23:28.080 --> 23:31.200
than just the chance
to move out of his mom's flat.

23:31.240 --> 23:35.560
[Prince] My parents,
they migrated from Ghana
and went to live in Italy.

23:35.600 --> 23:38.240
They felt that bringing me
over here to Europe

23:38.280 --> 23:41.240
would give me the opportunity
to actually make something
out of myself.

23:41.280 --> 23:43.960
Leaving your homeland
to go to somebody
else's homeland

23:44.000 --> 23:46.680
and being able
to have your kids,
raise your kids there

23:46.720 --> 23:48.760
and hope that they
can become something,

23:48.800 --> 23:51.400
that's the drive,
that's where
I get my drive from.

23:53.400 --> 23:54.680
Good morning.

23:54.720 --> 23:56.320
How are you doing, Fred?
I'm doing fine, thank you.

23:56.360 --> 23:58.360
-Yes, I'm fine,
how's it going?
-Good, thank you.

23:58.400 --> 24:01.120
Today, you're cooking
for two people.

24:01.160 --> 24:04.320
They are the most
important people you will
ever cook in your life.

24:04.360 --> 24:05.800
Yeah, yeah.

24:05.840 --> 24:09.080
-They want
that quality up there.
-I'm ready. [laughs]

24:09.120 --> 24:11.680
All you have to do
is produce the food
and you're off.

24:11.720 --> 24:13.280
-That's right.
-Good luck.

24:13.320 --> 24:14.720
-Thank you very much.
-Good luck, guys.

24:16.440 --> 24:18.480
[narrator]
Over the next few days,

24:18.520 --> 24:22.040
the investors will test
the restaurants' customer
service and business plans,

24:22.080 --> 24:25.080
but their private lunch today
is all about the food.

24:28.640 --> 24:34.240
On his guest list today, one of
Britain's most successful
investors, David Page.

24:34.280 --> 24:38.480
He's grown some
of the UK's biggest brands,
including PizzaExpress

24:38.520 --> 24:41.560
Gourmet Burger Kitchen
and Franco Manca.

24:41.600 --> 24:45.080
Trap Kitchen
has got 43,000 followers.

24:45.120 --> 24:51.080
And you probably have to pay
100,000 pounds to get that
amount of followers.

24:51.120 --> 24:57.920
And he's done it on his own.
He's got 43,000 people,
every day passing his door.

24:57.960 --> 24:59.720
And that's what's happening
to retail, of course.

24:59.760 --> 25:01.920
There's nobody now
going past the shop
on the corner,

25:01.960 --> 25:03.120
they're all looking
at Instagram.

25:08.160 --> 25:11.880
[narrator] Joining him,
Scott Collins
co-founder at 11-strong

25:11.920 --> 25:14.800
burger and cocktail group,
MEATLiquor.

25:14.840 --> 25:18.120
[Scott] I love the idea
that he's built his business
on social media,

25:18.160 --> 25:20.600
which is how we built
MEATLiquor.

25:20.640 --> 25:22.680
That has a synergy.

25:22.720 --> 25:25.360
I guess I'm quite jaded
when it comes to restaurants,

25:25.400 --> 25:29.920
but this is the most
exciting thing I've heard of
for quite some time.

25:29.960 --> 25:33.360
It's incredibly shrewd
business-wise
and marketing-wise.

25:34.480 --> 25:35.880
[David] I'm looking forward
to lunch.

25:35.920 --> 25:38.320
How is he gonna
present it in the restaurant?

25:38.360 --> 25:41.320
Is he gonna ponce it up?
I do hope he doesn't.

25:42.280 --> 25:44.880
Because that will, like,
ruin the...

25:44.920 --> 25:48.440
What he's obviously
very successful at the moment.

25:48.480 --> 25:51.640
If Prince makes it great,
then I'll be investing.

25:56.040 --> 25:57.840
-Hello.
-[Zair] Hello. Welcome
to Trap Kitchen.

25:57.880 --> 25:59.960
-Hello. I'm Prince.
-[David] Hello, Prince.

26:00.000 --> 26:01.000
David.

26:01.040 --> 26:03.000
-Scott.
-Scott, how are you there?

26:03.040 --> 26:04.960
-Are you guys hungry?
-We are, yeah. Yeah.

26:05.000 --> 26:06.600
I'll bring you over
to your seats

26:06.640 --> 26:08.760
'cause we've got
loads of food for you today.

26:08.800 --> 26:12.040
-[Prince] She's gonna
quickly serve it up.
-Yeah, yeah, it's okay.

26:12.080 --> 26:14.480
Have we got choice there
or is it coming like that?

26:14.520 --> 26:16.720
[Zair]
Uh, we've made everything
for you,

26:16.760 --> 26:19.400
so you can try everything,
if you don't mind.

26:19.440 --> 26:21.000
Okay, yeah.

26:21.040 --> 26:22.680
Don't worry, we won't be
offended if you can't
finish all of it.

26:22.720 --> 26:24.200
But we want you to try.

26:24.240 --> 26:25.840
-Happy to graze.
-Okay.

26:25.880 --> 26:29.200
Whenever I go out
for any meal, you served it,
you look at it.

26:29.240 --> 26:32.200
You instantly
make a connection whether
you like that food or not.

26:34.920 --> 26:37.760
Here we go.

26:37.800 --> 26:40.080
Still got a bit more.
Might be a bit
too filling today.

26:42.520 --> 26:44.880
I would've rather it was
one little bit at a time.

26:44.920 --> 26:46.160
Yeah.

26:46.200 --> 26:47.960
-Okay.
-Is it a race
to finish this first?

26:50.360 --> 26:51.360
[David] What we got here.

26:51.400 --> 26:53.160
-We got... Everything.
-Everything.

26:53.200 --> 26:54.520
Oh, okay.

26:54.560 --> 26:57.040
A bit of Cuban mash.
I know it's a lot to eat.

26:57.080 --> 26:59.160
Crumbs...

26:59.200 --> 27:01.320
-One packet of lime leaves.
-No.

27:01.360 --> 27:03.000
Maybe a quarter.

27:03.040 --> 27:06.600
This is much more high-stakes
than an average service
for us.

27:06.640 --> 27:08.760
-Much more high-stakes.
-Maybe half of that.

27:08.800 --> 27:09.760
Half of that.

27:09.800 --> 27:11.400
So I can feel the nerves

27:11.440 --> 27:14.000
actually, physically
starting to affect me
a little bit.

27:14.040 --> 27:15.760
I'm just trying
not to think about it...

27:15.800 --> 27:18.040
So don't ask me
any more questions.
[laughs]

27:22.880 --> 27:26.440
[narrator] Greedy Khao's
one shot at investment
rides on Chris Miller.

27:26.480 --> 27:29.280
He runs the White Rabbit
investment vehicle.

27:29.320 --> 27:34.680
This multi-million pound fund
has backed four new ideas
in the last year.

27:34.720 --> 27:37.800
Greedy Khao is a lunchtime
grab-and-go.

27:37.840 --> 27:43.800
I'd like to be able
to see it sitting alongside
a Pret or Wasabi.

27:43.840 --> 27:48.360
You know, one day a week
rather than going to an Itsu,
you'll go to Greedy Khao.

27:49.960 --> 27:52.000
If they can do that,

27:52.040 --> 27:55.920
then I think they are gonna be
in a very, very interesting
position in the market.

27:57.400 --> 28:00.600
I hope the food is
as exciting as the branding.

28:00.640 --> 28:03.360
It's gonna
be that first taste,

28:03.400 --> 28:05.960
and after that taste
would I want to come back?

28:08.240 --> 28:12.040
-Hello, welcome to Greedy Khao.
-Thank you very much.

28:12.080 --> 28:14.440
[Chris] So first question
what does Khao mean?

28:14.480 --> 28:17.320
Khao in Thai
means a meal of rice.

28:17.360 --> 28:20.080
So in a sense, Greedy Khao
doesn't mean anything,

28:20.120 --> 28:22.720
but we think it's fun,
it's cute.

28:22.760 --> 28:24.040
I'm actually starving.
[laughs]

28:24.080 --> 28:25.400
If it's possible
to get some food...

28:25.440 --> 28:27.560
We can definitely
help you with that.

28:27.600 --> 28:28.800
-Okay. Excellent.
-Grab a seat.

28:30.600 --> 28:35.680
I've looked at near on
300 restaurants
in the last year and a half.

28:35.720 --> 28:37.520
And I've invested in four.

28:37.560 --> 28:40.200
So you've got to offer
something very special.

28:40.240 --> 28:41.600
-And so here's the menu.
-Okay.

28:41.640 --> 28:44.000
And the prices are about
what you'd like to see--

28:44.040 --> 28:45.960
[Lee] They're about
what we would sell them as.

28:46.000 --> 28:49.680
You really need to be able
to get lunch and a drink

28:49.720 --> 28:55.280
for at least a bit
under 10 pounds for it
to be an acceptable offer.

28:55.320 --> 28:57.080
What we would do
in the concept,

28:57.120 --> 28:58.800
we'd have them
in our little takeaway box.

28:58.840 --> 29:02.280
You'd get some curry,
for example, rice
and a side for that price.

29:02.320 --> 29:04.960
So we're pricing
roughly the same as

29:05.000 --> 29:09.040
the Leons and the Wasabis
would do for that kind of,
that kind of full meal.

29:09.080 --> 29:10.480
Yeah.

29:10.520 --> 29:11.920
People will go
to a restaurant
because of the hype,

29:11.960 --> 29:13.400
because it's new,
because it's exciting,

29:13.440 --> 29:15.640
but they'll only come back
if the food is great.

29:15.680 --> 29:19.080
All righty, so here are
the first dishes
that we'd like to present.

29:19.120 --> 29:20.720
These are our classics.

29:20.760 --> 29:23.440
This is the red curry
with tofu puffs
and butternut squash.

29:23.480 --> 29:26.280
-Okay.
-This is the green curry
with chicken,

29:26.320 --> 29:27.600
which is a soy protein.

29:27.640 --> 29:30.720
This is a challenge,
'cause tofu generally...

29:30.760 --> 29:32.200
-[Faai] You don't like...
-Pretty bland.

29:52.280 --> 29:54.440
Just gonna come around
and join you guys.

29:54.480 --> 29:55.880
-Okay.
-When was that made?

29:55.920 --> 29:58.840
-Um, probably about, uh...
-This morning?

29:58.880 --> 30:00.240
-Yeah.
-Yeah, all right.

30:00.280 --> 30:03.400
My view, Prince, is that
I was a bit disappointed

30:03.440 --> 30:05.920
that it was actually cold
by the time it got to me.

30:05.960 --> 30:08.360
They're all on one plate,
so it was all
a bit of a mixture.

30:08.400 --> 30:10.800
And I'm looking, tomorrow
when we come back for lunch,

30:10.840 --> 30:16.640
to be able to see
and taste all the individual
dishes slightly separately.

30:16.680 --> 30:18.880
You've recognized
the hurdle already,
haven't you?

30:18.920 --> 30:23.240
It was far from terrible,
that would've been
my worst nightmare,

30:23.280 --> 30:25.400
but you were a bit
rabbit in the headlights,

30:25.440 --> 30:28.120
throwing it all at us
in the same time.

30:28.160 --> 30:30.760
The mac n' cheese
needs to be more cheesy,

30:30.800 --> 30:32.720
so I'd scrap the mozzarella.

30:32.760 --> 30:34.600
And mozzarella
is quite expensive.

30:34.640 --> 30:38.200
You could probably
replace it with a cheaper,
better, more flavorsome cheese.

30:38.240 --> 30:39.320
Yeah.

30:39.360 --> 30:42.040
Also presentation
is not very good.

30:42.080 --> 30:43.520
And I wasn't very impressed.

30:43.560 --> 30:44.800
What do you normally
serve this in?

30:44.840 --> 30:46.600
Um... White boxes.

30:46.640 --> 30:47.880
Can I see them?

30:49.480 --> 30:51.400
So that is
the Trap Kitchen experience.

30:51.440 --> 30:54.240
Then I think that's what
you should be serving in.

30:56.400 --> 30:58.560
[David] I liked him, Prince.

30:58.600 --> 31:01.040
Lobster was
about the best thing,

31:01.080 --> 31:03.680
but visually it needs
a lot of improvement.

31:03.720 --> 31:06.960
It's great for take-out,
great for delivery,

31:07.000 --> 31:10.960
but poor for imaging
for a restaurant.

31:11.000 --> 31:13.560
Had you worked in,
like, a commercial
kitchen before?

31:13.600 --> 31:15.000
-No. Never.
-No?

31:15.040 --> 31:16.720
-You're doing
quite good numbers.
-Yeah, yeah.

31:16.760 --> 31:19.200
Like,
I built it up slowly,
it was going slow, going slow,

31:19.240 --> 31:21.760
and then there was a point
where it just went boom.

31:21.800 --> 31:25.120
Forty-three thousand followers
is mental. How did
you pull that off?

31:26.760 --> 31:29.600
-I don't know.
-It's not just the food,
it's your charisma.

31:29.640 --> 31:31.360
[Scott] People's perception

31:31.400 --> 31:34.680
of what a restaurant is,
has changed massively
over the years.

31:34.720 --> 31:37.840
He's doing massive numbers
for three days' trade a week.

31:38.840 --> 31:40.440
So he's doing lots right.

31:41.080 --> 31:43.240
Cheers.

31:43.280 --> 31:47.800
[Scott] He has a lot to learn
in a lot of areas, so it's not
gonna be straight forward.

31:47.840 --> 31:50.680
But I think he could
be worked with.

31:50.720 --> 31:54.800
He doesn't seem to have
much idea of what
a restaurant customer wants.

31:54.840 --> 31:57.600
They want to see
the food being prepared,

31:57.640 --> 32:00.080
they want to see it
come out hot and then want
to get it while it's hot

32:00.120 --> 32:02.040
and then eat it while it's hot.

32:02.080 --> 32:04.240
I'm looking forward
to coming back, 'cause I hope
he's gonna improve.

32:04.280 --> 32:06.320
It wasn't bad enough
for me not to come back.

32:06.360 --> 32:09.160
They just felt that
the menu...

32:10.240 --> 32:12.840
Just switch it up,
go back to basics.

32:12.880 --> 32:15.920
So I want to get rid
of the Portland jerk chicken,

32:15.960 --> 32:17.520
I'm gonna add
cheddar cheese into my mac,

32:17.560 --> 32:20.640
I'm gonna get rid
of the potato mash
and the French fries...

32:20.680 --> 32:22.640
Yeah.
The most important thing
that needs to be there,

32:22.680 --> 32:24.520
of course, is the waffle
and the mac n' cheese.

32:24.560 --> 32:26.800
We'll just see
what happens tomorrow.
[laughs]

32:30.760 --> 32:32.920
So, Red Thai Curry...

32:32.960 --> 32:36.920
The core sauce
and ingredients...

32:38.080 --> 32:39.320
All nice.

32:39.360 --> 32:42.880
Um, the tofu...

32:45.120 --> 32:46.520
You're still undecided
about tofu--

32:46.560 --> 32:50.320
That's also,
it's a personal
preference on tofu.

32:51.800 --> 32:54.400
My first opening concern is,

32:54.440 --> 32:57.680
I think they've relied too
heavily on meat substitutes.

32:57.720 --> 33:03.200
It needs to have
that real, exceptional
standout, next level

33:03.240 --> 33:04.880
where you go,
"Ah, there's a reason why...

33:04.920 --> 33:06.880
"They're doing
something different here."

33:06.920 --> 33:09.400
My heart always sinks
a little bit if somebody
doesn't like something.

33:09.440 --> 33:12.200
I don't like some dishes,
I love some dishes.

33:12.240 --> 33:13.600
Yeah.

33:13.640 --> 33:14.800
-I think it's okay.
It's normal.
-It's only normal.

33:14.840 --> 33:16.600
And at least we know
he's a super honest guy.

33:16.640 --> 33:18.680
I'm just thinking,
from his perspective,

33:18.720 --> 33:21.080
he's thinking about
what would make
this dish complete.

33:21.120 --> 33:22.760
Yeah.

33:22.800 --> 33:24.160
Whereas from our perspective,
we're most of the time,
it's like,

33:24.200 --> 33:26.640
"How do we make it
the way it's
supposed to taste?"

33:26.680 --> 33:29.040
Now that looks very good.

33:29.080 --> 33:30.560
[Lee] This is Khao Soi noodles.

33:30.920 --> 33:32.880
Right.

33:32.920 --> 33:35.760
[Lee] What you won't like
is that it also has the
same type of fried tofu in it.

33:35.800 --> 33:36.800
Um...

33:37.960 --> 33:39.920
It's just a different
kind of curry base.

33:39.960 --> 33:41.840
Well,
let's start with the tofu.

33:48.680 --> 33:50.520
The sauce
in there is fantastic.

33:51.720 --> 33:53.440
This dish has raised
the game

33:53.480 --> 33:57.240
because it's not
just another red or green
Thai curry.

33:57.280 --> 34:01.200
And what I'm looking for
is not the same dishes

34:01.240 --> 34:06.200
that you find in
every Thai restaurant that's
already on the high street.

34:06.240 --> 34:11.360
What I would love to see...
Is it done in a way
that is more the experience

34:11.400 --> 34:15.960
from a grab-and-go customer,
which is what it's gonna be.

34:16.000 --> 34:19.160
I'd quite like
to ditch all the crockery,

34:19.200 --> 34:22.920
and if we can get hold of any
grab and go boxes,

34:22.960 --> 34:25.120
throw the rice in,
throw it all together

34:25.160 --> 34:26.600
make it a bit more
of a...

34:26.640 --> 34:28.240
What you'd experience
if you walked in

34:28.280 --> 34:30.160
from the street for lunch.

34:30.200 --> 34:32.640
Let us try and recreate
for you what we normally do.

34:32.680 --> 34:36.240
-Yeah.
-And I guess we'll
take it from there.

34:36.280 --> 34:37.840
[Faai] Thank you very much
for your comment.

34:37.880 --> 34:40.600
[Chris]
No, no, thank you very much
for lunch.

34:40.640 --> 34:44.960
I'm remaining open,
really, that last dish
was a kicker.

34:45.000 --> 34:47.680
What I'd like is to see her
being a bit braver

34:47.720 --> 34:51.880
with the ingredients,
and doing something
that is as bold

34:51.920 --> 34:54.880
and exciting
as their branding.

34:54.920 --> 34:57.000
I'm still kind of
undecided on that, maybe.

34:57.040 --> 34:59.640
I don't know why
whether it was like, you should
remove the meat substitutes

34:59.680 --> 35:01.560
and just focus on veg,
which I disagree with.

35:01.600 --> 35:05.280
I feel like there needs to be
that protein, texture-y,
meaty element in it

35:05.320 --> 35:06.920
for it to be a full meal
that I'm gonna pay

35:06.960 --> 35:08.640
eight or nine quid
or whatever for.

35:08.680 --> 35:11.160
There are issues,
but the...

35:11.200 --> 35:15.600
There's definitely still
something quite interesting
about what they're doing.

35:15.640 --> 35:17.880
There's still an opportunity
of an investment.

35:17.920 --> 35:21.400
It's um...
It just needs a bit of work.

35:25.680 --> 35:29.160
[narrator] Tomorrow lunchtime,
the pressure builds.

35:29.200 --> 35:32.360
The investors will get to see
how well the restaurants cope

35:32.400 --> 35:34.640
when they're full
of paying customers.

35:34.680 --> 35:36.720
But today isn't over.

35:36.760 --> 35:38.840
We'll see you later.

35:38.880 --> 35:40.760
[Chris] Good luck, guys.

35:40.800 --> 35:45.000
[narrator] Lee and Faai
and Prince now face
a high-stakes business meeting.

35:45.040 --> 35:50.200
One hour with the investors
to go through their finances
and plans for their future.

35:50.240 --> 35:53.680
I will be testing Greedy Khao
on their numbers.

35:53.720 --> 35:57.400
It needs to be something
with the cost of ingredients,

35:57.440 --> 36:02.320
plus, you know, the cost
of staff, plus your overheads,
plus your rent,

36:02.360 --> 36:05.880
but you end up
still with the ability
to make money from it.

36:05.920 --> 36:10.360
[narrator] Lee and Faai
are asking Chris for
a £225,000 investment.

36:17.600 --> 36:20.760
I've just been
looking through
your business plan,

36:20.800 --> 36:21.920
and...

36:23.640 --> 36:26.400
It's one of the best
that I've seen
in a very long time.

36:26.440 --> 36:27.400
Wow.

36:27.440 --> 36:29.880
And I get sent
one of these a day.

36:29.920 --> 36:36.040
The thing that still,
I'm not quite sold on yet
is the cost of each dish,

36:36.080 --> 36:40.320
when you're up against
Pret and Itsu
and the rest of it.

36:42.040 --> 36:45.400
With takeaway hot food,
you have to add VAT to it.

36:45.440 --> 36:46.920
You do, yeah, you do.

36:46.960 --> 36:51.680
So that means
someone's paying £9.60

36:51.720 --> 36:55.480
for their main dish,
with rice, etc...

36:55.520 --> 37:00.080
Plus a pound, £1.50
for a drink.

37:00.120 --> 37:01.760
And that's where
it starts to
become uncomfortable.

37:01.800 --> 37:03.360
That is definitely
uncomfortable.

37:03.400 --> 37:07.000
When we were thinking
about the VAT,
we were thinking more...

37:07.040 --> 37:09.440
Yeah, just add it on,
if people want to sit in,

37:09.480 --> 37:12.560
forgot about the fact
that your hot food is...
Even if they wanna--

37:12.600 --> 37:15.440
Even if you take it away,
you do have to charge
for it.

37:15.480 --> 37:19.080
If, to make it
a more acceptable
grab-and-go lunchtime,

37:19.120 --> 37:20.880
we have to bring
the price down,

37:20.920 --> 37:22.720
your revenue's going to drop

37:22.760 --> 37:25.720
and so the profit at the bottom
will be slightly lower.

37:26.880 --> 37:28.800
But then, equally, you hope
you do more sales.

37:28.840 --> 37:32.120
-[Lee] More sales, yeah.
-So...

37:32.160 --> 37:35.840
[narrator] During the meeting,
Chris can choose to spell out
the offer he'll make

37:35.880 --> 37:39.040
if, and only if,
he decides to invest tomorrow.

37:41.440 --> 37:43.960
So you're looking
for £225,000,

37:44.000 --> 37:46.720
offering a 20% stake
in the business.

37:46.760 --> 37:51.120
Typically, I look to take
a majority stake at the start

37:52.200 --> 37:54.400
but with a clawback mechanism,

37:54.440 --> 37:58.600
which means
you're earning more as you hit
certain success points.

37:59.640 --> 38:01.440
I personally would
feel uncomfortable

38:01.480 --> 38:03.840
giving away
a majority stake, because
then that makes me feel

38:03.880 --> 38:06.760
as if I don't have control
of what direction
the business is going now.

38:06.800 --> 38:12.880
I put into contract
a long list of things
that you have final say over

38:12.920 --> 38:18.440
so you don't feel
like you're losing control of
what is your baby.

38:18.480 --> 38:21.760
You can have
well-structured arguments
in a piece of paper

38:21.800 --> 38:23.200
and you can have
great branding,

38:23.240 --> 38:25.960
but ultimately
what is gonna
get people coming back

38:26.000 --> 38:27.640
to your restaurant is the food.

38:27.680 --> 38:28.800
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

38:28.840 --> 38:30.320
-Cheers.
-Thanks a lot.

38:30.360 --> 38:34.960
It's make or break tomorrow,
if I'm honest,
on the taste.

38:35.000 --> 38:38.080
-Your hands were shaky.
-Yeah, I felt that.

38:39.360 --> 38:40.880
[Lee] Tomorrow's
our last chance
to impress

38:40.920 --> 38:42.600
and just show
what we can really do.

38:42.640 --> 38:44.680
It's really important for us
that he backs us.

38:44.720 --> 38:48.400
The catering industry
is a very fast moving industry.

38:48.440 --> 38:51.480
-Extremely fast moving.
-And you need to move fast,
otherwise you'll just lose it.

38:51.520 --> 38:54.560
Otherwise, there's gonna
be another vegan Thai place
with backing

38:54.600 --> 38:57.960
that will get into
the public's consciousness
before we do,

38:58.000 --> 38:59.440
and then they will
become known

38:59.480 --> 39:01.280
as that really good
vegan-Thai brand,

39:01.320 --> 39:03.160
and that's what
we want to be known as.

39:07.280 --> 39:11.000
[narrator]
It's now Prince's turn
to talk business.

39:11.040 --> 39:14.920
I really like Prince.
I admire anyone
who can dream so big.

39:14.960 --> 39:18.600
But he's so raw,
he's only operated
from his mom's kitchen.

39:18.640 --> 39:21.640
And that is a leap of faith
the investors
will have to take.

39:21.680 --> 39:25.600
And I can't wait
to find out if they're willing
to do that.

39:25.640 --> 39:29.640
[narrator] As both investors
see Trap Kitchen as
a serious business opportunity,

39:29.680 --> 39:31.560
they'll each have an hour
alone with Prince.

39:31.600 --> 39:33.040
Hello again. How are you?

39:33.080 --> 39:34.680
Fine.

39:34.720 --> 39:36.840
[David]
So, he's taking ten grand
on three nights a week.

39:36.880 --> 39:39.000
Whatever he's doing
is working.

39:39.040 --> 39:41.760
Whether you can transfer
that to a business environment

39:41.800 --> 39:43.600
where you sign a lease,
got responsibilities...

39:43.640 --> 39:46.320
At the moment
it's all a bit hanging loose.

39:52.040 --> 39:56.040
Your accounts were good,
as far as they went,

39:56.080 --> 40:00.160
I noticed for a couple of days
the electricity was 20 quid

40:00.200 --> 40:03.240
and then you didn't
pay your mom one day
on a Tuesday or something.

40:03.280 --> 40:04.760
I don't what happened then.

40:04.800 --> 40:07.400
And you obviously just
estimated the cost
or something.

40:07.440 --> 40:11.040
But, I mean, that all
needs to be worked out
slightly finer

40:11.080 --> 40:12.840
with just a blank sheet
of paper.

40:12.880 --> 40:15.920
Start your turnover,
you get a lot of costs
being taken off.

40:15.960 --> 40:18.440
In bottom right-hand corner
is the profit,
and then hopefully

40:18.480 --> 40:19.800
that's quite a nice figure.

40:19.840 --> 40:21.600
This is all still
kind of new to me.

40:21.640 --> 40:23.160
I've been in it
for about a year,

40:23.200 --> 40:25.680
so obviously you know
exactly what
you're talking about.

40:25.720 --> 40:27.720
-Because you've--
-I've done it.

40:27.760 --> 40:29.240
-Yeah, you've done it.
-Done it.

40:31.880 --> 40:36.880
I'm still staggered
how you got from zero
to 43,000 followers.

40:36.920 --> 40:39.000
-Did you buy a load of 'em?
-Oh, hell, no.

40:39.040 --> 40:41.280
I didn't buy
not even one of them.

40:41.320 --> 40:43.320
Do you appreciate
how big that is, though?

40:43.360 --> 40:47.440
Yeah. Not even just Instagram,
Snapchat is actually an
even better way

40:47.480 --> 40:50.240
-of getting
your product across.
-Followers? Yeah.

40:50.280 --> 40:51.640
That's very smart.

40:51.680 --> 40:54.200
-Exactly.
-Very smart.

40:54.240 --> 40:56.600
[Scott] He's clearly
entrepreneurial.

40:56.640 --> 40:59.960
It doesn't matter to me
that he's inexperienced
at all,

41:00.000 --> 41:01.240
because I started at the bottom

41:01.280 --> 41:03.320
and I was given
some great breaks

41:03.360 --> 41:05.800
and I grafted
and worked my way up.

41:05.840 --> 41:08.680
So, I see that as a positive
rather than a negative.

41:08.720 --> 41:11.600
Uh, so I'm really
looking forward
to lunch tomorrow.

41:11.640 --> 41:14.160
And what I'd like to see
is the food arriving hot...

41:15.200 --> 41:16.680
It all was
a bit lumpy today,

41:16.720 --> 41:19.680
a bit piled up,
you know, which I know
is the style.

41:19.720 --> 41:21.880
I took some
of your advice in.

41:21.920 --> 41:25.280
And definitely
I'll be serving that
in Styrofoam boxes.

41:25.320 --> 41:29.360
So it was definitely needed.
The advice.

41:29.400 --> 41:31.320
-I'm here to learn.
-Yeah, okay.

41:31.360 --> 41:34.400
I'm here to just
make changes where I can.

41:34.440 --> 41:37.440
[narrator] Scott and David
might need more
convincing tomorrow,

41:37.480 --> 41:41.040
but they both have
a potential offer for Prince.

41:41.080 --> 41:44.040
I think you should
get a permanent base.
And I'll help you.

41:44.080 --> 41:46.160
What you'll need
is a link to the property

41:46.200 --> 41:48.760
-and a link
to the equipment...
-Yeah.

41:48.800 --> 41:51.880
And I'll make sure
you'll get both those things.

41:51.920 --> 41:55.400
So what you're offering there
is basically a premises

41:55.440 --> 41:57.920
-and a link to equipments.
-That's right.

41:57.960 --> 42:00.400
And obviously
we desperately need those.

42:00.440 --> 42:03.360
Anyways,
so I'll base my decision
on what happens tomorrow...

42:03.400 --> 42:07.240
-Cool.
-...lunchtime and if the food
is better presented than today.

42:08.120 --> 42:09.480
Cool.

42:09.520 --> 42:12.360
[Scott]
What he's doing
is unusual,

42:12.400 --> 42:14.800
which I think is what
the high street needs,

42:14.840 --> 42:17.560
in that you go out
in the high street now
and it's all the same.

42:17.600 --> 42:21.120
Something novel like this,
if it breaks,
it can be very big.

42:22.280 --> 42:24.800
Have you looked
into commercial premises?

42:25.160 --> 42:26.360
Yeah.

42:26.400 --> 42:28.240
The premiums
are pretty expensive.

42:28.280 --> 42:31.440
There shouldn't be any premium
for a commercial kitchen,

42:31.480 --> 42:34.720
but you wouldn't know that
but that's something I could...

42:34.760 --> 42:37.840
So, I guess, tomorrow
if that goes well,
I don't see any reason

42:37.880 --> 42:42.040
why I can't help you
make that next step.

42:42.080 --> 42:44.080
-Thank you.
-Don't mention it.

42:44.120 --> 42:46.240
-Thanks, man.
-[laughs]

42:46.280 --> 42:47.800
[Prince]
Ever since
I started Trap Kitchen

42:47.840 --> 42:50.080
I've been grafting,
you know what I mean,
like nonstop,

42:50.120 --> 42:52.720
and hard work
has brought me here,

42:52.760 --> 42:56.200
so tomorrow is the big day.
It could possibly
change my life.

43:10.960 --> 43:13.520
[Fred]
In Manchester,
it's the third and final day

43:13.560 --> 43:15.520
for Greedy Khao
and Trap Kitchen.

43:15.560 --> 43:19.440
Now they must prove
they can run a restaurant
for full paying customers.

43:19.480 --> 43:22.080
The investors will sit in
and watch their every move

43:22.120 --> 43:25.520
and only then decide
if they put their hands
in their pocket.

43:25.560 --> 43:29.000
For Lee, Faai and Prince,
it's a life-defining moment.

43:29.040 --> 43:31.000
And they must deliver.

43:31.040 --> 43:33.720
Faai, is it just the lime peel
or is it okay if there's
some of the flesh as well?

43:33.760 --> 43:37.000
Today Chris is gonna
get a better idea
about Greedy Khao is about.

43:37.040 --> 43:38.600
Today could change our life.

43:38.640 --> 43:40.800
You two get your aprons on.

43:40.840 --> 43:42.920
And let's do some work.

43:42.960 --> 43:45.200
We've got two important
guests coming in today,

43:45.240 --> 43:47.520
so I want everybody
to be on their A game.

43:47.560 --> 43:50.120
Every single food
that we push out today
has to be hot.

43:50.160 --> 43:52.440
If you feel like
it's not hot, bring it back.

43:52.480 --> 43:54.120
So, you're gonna be back
on the tills again.

43:54.160 --> 43:55.680
-Yeah.
-[Prince] Yeah, and...

43:55.720 --> 43:57.120
You're gonna be serving.

43:57.160 --> 43:58.480
You guys know
what you're doing, right?

43:58.520 --> 44:00.560
-Yeah.
-Get crackin' guys,
thank you very much.

44:00.600 --> 44:03.400
Obviously, I knew I couldn't
be smiley, smiley
with the staff anymore

44:03.440 --> 44:06.760
because, um, I think,
our last service, we didn't
do so great.

44:06.800 --> 44:08.520
So everybody knows that

44:08.560 --> 44:12.480
it is a real kitchen
and we gotta get
the job done properly.

44:13.280 --> 44:15.000
-Morning.
-How's it going?

44:15.040 --> 44:17.480
Well, I can see
you're very well
organized today.

44:17.520 --> 44:18.640
Yeah, yeah.

44:18.680 --> 44:21.760
This is like a 360
change in this kitchen.

44:21.800 --> 44:23.520
You really reduced
the menu, didn't you?

44:23.560 --> 44:26.440
[Prince] Yes, I did. So, um,
I decided to take
a few things out.

44:26.480 --> 44:29.440
Things that I don't usually
serve on a normal
Trap Kitchen day.

44:29.480 --> 44:32.360
And, um, just basically
going back to basics, really.

44:32.400 --> 44:34.560
Just doing what
the customers love us for.

44:34.600 --> 44:37.440
This is bold,
this is very strong.

44:37.480 --> 44:39.200
It's very important
in this business

44:39.240 --> 44:41.000
you need to constantly
change and adapt.

44:41.040 --> 44:43.600
It's really good. Good luck.
Keep that smile up, you know.

44:43.640 --> 44:46.640
The race is almost over.
Like you've gotta finish.

44:46.680 --> 44:47.920
Right.

44:47.960 --> 44:50.960
-Take care. See you later.
-Take care. All right.

44:51.000 --> 44:54.920
[narrator] In Greedy Khao,
Lee and Faai are preparing
to offer Chris

44:54.960 --> 44:57.480
a more typical
grab-and-go experience.

44:57.520 --> 45:00.840
So one thing that
Chris did mention
was that

45:00.880 --> 45:04.160
some of the curries
could do with a little bit
of texture on top.

45:04.200 --> 45:08.160
And that's what we use
the crispy shallots for,
so they can see what it's like

45:08.200 --> 45:09.560
the way we would
normally serve it.

45:09.600 --> 45:11.360
So what we're gonna do
is just for him,

45:11.400 --> 45:14.680
we're gonna prep
a couple of portions
in our regular take-away boxes.

45:15.840 --> 45:18.000
-Morning.
-Oh, good morning.

45:18.040 --> 45:20.320
-Hi, Faai. Lee.
-Hello, are you okay?

45:20.360 --> 45:22.360
I'm very good,
looking forward
to our final day.

45:22.400 --> 45:25.080
Yeah.
How many dishes
are you changing?

45:26.160 --> 45:27.520
We're not changing anything.

45:27.560 --> 45:29.880
We're not really changing,
we're more adding.

45:29.920 --> 45:32.600
Um, adding some sides,
and adding some textures

45:32.640 --> 45:34.360
that weren't there
in the dish that we had before.

45:34.400 --> 45:35.560
And you think it's enough?

45:36.160 --> 45:37.360
Yeah.

45:37.400 --> 45:40.440
We believe in
our business vision and food.

45:40.480 --> 45:43.640
Um...
And, yeah.
We're confident.

45:43.680 --> 45:47.160
Chris is obviously looking for
that exceptional food.

45:47.200 --> 45:49.560
And hopefully we'll be able
to deliver that today

45:49.600 --> 45:52.120
and at the end of the day
we'll get the investment

45:52.160 --> 45:54.320
-and we can open
a bottle of champagne.
-[laughs]

45:54.360 --> 45:55.800
-Take care. Enjoy.
-[Faai] Thank you.

45:55.840 --> 45:56.880
-Thanks.
-Bye.

45:56.920 --> 45:58.120
-See you.
-Bye.

45:59.360 --> 46:01.240
Guys, let's work.

46:06.720 --> 46:09.080
-Hi, guys, how are you today?
-Not too bad.

46:09.120 --> 46:11.480
Good afternoon, guys.
Welcome to Greedy Khao.

46:11.520 --> 46:15.760
[narrator] 12:30 p.m.
Greedy Khao and Trap Kitchen
are open for lunch.

46:15.800 --> 46:17.800
[Prince] We're gonna get rid
of the china

46:17.840 --> 46:21.400
and today we serve
how we normally serve.

46:21.440 --> 46:25.440
[narrator] Both restaurants
are fully booked
and expecting 50 covers.

46:25.480 --> 46:26.640
There's a Cajun ready...

46:26.680 --> 46:28.440
[Prince] I need a chicken on
that as well.

46:28.480 --> 46:31.040
-I'd recommend one each.
-[man] Okay, one each.

46:31.080 --> 46:34.120
[Chris] The big question today
is, have they upped their game
of the food?

46:34.160 --> 46:36.280
Because, for me, I'm not
looking for something

46:36.320 --> 46:39.840
which is as good
as what is on currently
on the high streets.

46:39.880 --> 46:43.920
I'm looking for something
that does it a lot better,
very unique,

46:43.960 --> 46:45.920
That is what
will make it a success,

46:45.960 --> 46:49.000
that is what we'll be able
to turn it into a nationwide
or global brand.

46:49.040 --> 46:51.160
And so that's what
today's about.

46:51.200 --> 46:53.280
Are you going to have a table,
or shall I sit you
up at the bar?

46:53.320 --> 46:55.400
-Actually here.
That'll be great.
-Okay.

46:56.480 --> 46:57.600
Hello guys,
how are you doing?

46:59.000 --> 47:01.280
I'm kind of familiar
with the kitchen now,

47:01.320 --> 47:04.600
and it's all about
just adapting, really.

47:08.360 --> 47:12.920
[Scott] I mean, regarding
investment, he has a lot
to learn in a lot of areas,

47:12.960 --> 47:15.760
So it's not gonna be
straightforward.

47:15.800 --> 47:17.720
There might be some questions
are answered today.

47:17.760 --> 47:20.520
There might be
more questions are raised.

47:20.560 --> 47:23.280
[David] There is room
to grow his business
and get a permanent kitchen,

47:23.320 --> 47:25.840
but whether I want
anything to do with it is up to

47:25.880 --> 47:27.760
the experience at lunchtime

47:27.800 --> 47:31.040
and how he copes
with real people
in a real restaurant.

47:33.160 --> 47:34.960
-Hello again.
-Nice to see you both again.

47:35.000 --> 47:36.400
Yeah.

47:36.440 --> 47:38.280
-I'll bring you guys
over to the table?
-Yeah. Okay.

47:38.320 --> 47:41.480
[Fred] The investors
have just gone in,
and Prince has made the changes

47:41.520 --> 47:44.280
just like they asked...
He's gone back to basics

47:44.320 --> 47:46.440
so that they can see
the real Trap Kitchen.

47:47.720 --> 47:50.280
Hello, Prince,
how're you doing?
Doing good?

47:50.320 --> 47:51.640
Looking forward
to seeing the...

47:51.680 --> 47:53.520
Some small changes
that have happened, so...

47:57.200 --> 48:00.800
So come back for the Khao Soi,
three rice and a Laad.

48:03.040 --> 48:05.080
-It's your duck curry.
-Oh, lovely.

48:05.120 --> 48:06.720
And the Jackfruit Laad.

48:06.760 --> 48:11.440
It's already got
a more positive feel to it.

48:11.480 --> 48:14.160
But it's...
You can see people enjoying it.

48:17.320 --> 48:21.280
Hi, Chris, so what
we've got here is soy
and sesame slaw on the side

48:21.320 --> 48:23.440
and we've got those lovely,
crispy shallots on top.

48:23.480 --> 48:24.800
And this is
what we normally do.

48:24.840 --> 48:26.720
You know, this has
all of those elements

48:26.760 --> 48:28.280
that you talked about
as well.

48:28.320 --> 48:30.920
It already
feels more complete

48:30.960 --> 48:32.840
and the kind of thing
you'd order at lunch.

48:38.280 --> 48:40.600
Much better with the crunch.
Bit more texture.

48:41.720 --> 48:43.560
The slaw is lovely.

48:43.600 --> 48:47.120
And sticking it
all in a brown box
makes it a bit more relaxed.

48:47.160 --> 48:49.240
-Just makes all the difference.
-Excellent.

48:49.280 --> 48:51.760
I think Chris definitely
can see the concept

48:51.800 --> 48:53.680
that we're pitching to
much more clearly now.

48:53.720 --> 48:56.960
He even likes the flavors more
when they're presented
in this casual format.

48:57.000 --> 48:58.840
I'm very happy to hear that.

49:02.440 --> 49:03.680
Prince, they're lovin'
the mac n' cheese.

49:09.520 --> 49:10.840
Very good.

49:10.880 --> 49:11.920
[David] It's great, isn't it?

49:11.960 --> 49:14.480
Actually looks...
There's a bit of theater

49:14.520 --> 49:16.440
even though
it's a polystyrene box.

49:16.480 --> 49:18.440
Either way you like.
We're gonna share all of it.

49:18.480 --> 49:21.240
No problem, there we go.
Please enjoy, thank you.

49:21.280 --> 49:23.120
[Scott] Now that looks
100 times better,
doesn't it?

49:23.160 --> 49:24.240
It does, yeah. Yeah.

49:24.920 --> 49:26.160
It's piping hot.

49:26.200 --> 49:27.800
[chuckles]

49:27.840 --> 49:30.080
Right. I'll try this cheese.

49:31.800 --> 49:34.040
I don't think the mac n' cheese
is still making it.

49:34.080 --> 49:35.600
-It's still not
cheesy enough, is it?
-No.

49:35.640 --> 49:37.640
All I can taste
is the seasoning again.

49:37.680 --> 49:39.920
The presentation of
the lobster tail is
completely different this time.

49:39.960 --> 49:41.080
Yeah, I know.

49:41.120 --> 49:43.400
This is 20 quid.
And you can pay 20 quid

49:43.440 --> 49:46.240
for a ruddy Domino's
and two liters of fizzy water.

49:46.280 --> 49:47.800
No lobster on it.

49:47.840 --> 49:49.680
And so much more exciting.

49:49.720 --> 49:51.520
I'd say a Domino's alternative.

49:52.800 --> 49:54.040
[David] Looked genuine...

49:54.080 --> 49:56.400
In a polystyrene box, you know,
would you believe?

49:56.440 --> 49:58.000
It looked
more genuine than on a...

49:58.040 --> 50:00.280
Than lumped
on a crockery plate.

50:00.320 --> 50:02.560
-It's good heat
on there as well.
-It's not too sweet.

50:02.600 --> 50:05.680
[Scott] The second experience
was infinitely better
than the first.

50:05.720 --> 50:08.200
Yeah, he made an effort,
and with everything he's got
on his plate,

50:08.240 --> 50:10.400
it's quite good going,
I wasn't expecting that.

50:17.320 --> 50:18.320
-How are you?
-Good, thank you.

50:18.360 --> 50:19.680
-Good to see you.
-Good.

50:19.720 --> 50:21.480
-How's the food?
-[Chris] They've...

50:21.520 --> 50:23.440
Gone a bit more
down the route
to what they're used to,

50:23.480 --> 50:24.760
which is street food.

50:24.800 --> 50:27.080
-It totally changes the...
-[Fred] Really?

50:27.120 --> 50:29.480
-Yeah.
-So is it a bit
of a dilemma for you now?

50:29.520 --> 50:30.440
Are you...

50:30.480 --> 50:32.840
-[laughs] A little bit.
-Really?

50:32.880 --> 50:34.520
[Chris] I could see
a few of these
on the high street

50:34.560 --> 50:39.240
sitting next to a Wasabi
or a Pret or an Itsu.

50:39.280 --> 50:42.600
Yeah, I could see
people choosing this
for lunch quite happily.

50:42.640 --> 50:43.800
Must be difficult.

50:44.960 --> 50:47.160
It's always difficult.

50:47.200 --> 50:50.400
Ultimately
you gotta write a check.

50:50.440 --> 50:52.440
You gotta roll the dice,
and you don't know
if it works

50:52.480 --> 50:55.760
until six months,
a year down the line
to see if actually,

50:55.800 --> 50:58.280
if people come
and if they come back again.

50:58.320 --> 50:59.560
-Good luck.
-Thank you.

50:59.600 --> 51:01.520
See you later.

51:01.560 --> 51:04.640
Lee and Faai
have definitely
got my interest back

51:04.680 --> 51:08.480
from yesterday.
The next couple of hours,
there'll be some maths.

51:08.520 --> 51:13.000
I've gotta work out
what they need to sell
this for to make it work.

51:13.040 --> 51:16.720
All right. I'm off.
Thank you very much
for your time.

51:16.760 --> 51:17.680
Thank you.

51:17.720 --> 51:19.280
[Chris]
I've then gonna look at

51:19.320 --> 51:23.040
what, at that price,
will enough people come,

51:23.080 --> 51:25.120
and then decide
if I'm gonna come back
into that room

51:25.160 --> 51:28.160
and put in an offer.

51:28.200 --> 51:31.320
[narrator] In Trap Kitchen,
Scott and David
have got their hands on

51:31.360 --> 51:33.240
some customer
comment cards.

51:33.280 --> 51:36.000
[Scott] "Great combination
and different food
and flavors."

51:36.040 --> 51:38.080
"Seafood was great."

51:38.120 --> 51:40.000
"If I can only eat one thing
for the rest of my life
it'll be that mac n' cheese."

51:40.040 --> 51:41.520
Very good.

51:41.560 --> 51:45.440
I'm not a good Samaritan.
I'm here to try and make money

51:45.480 --> 51:48.360
and then go and lie
on a beach as soon
as possible, all right?

51:48.400 --> 51:53.480
I'm gonna away
and think about if I wanna
help him, yes or no.

51:53.520 --> 51:56.440
[David]
The waffles... I don't know
how old they were.

51:56.480 --> 51:58.120
Um, the garlic bread...

51:58.160 --> 52:00.480
I mean, he's done
fantastically well

52:00.520 --> 52:04.560
because he's got to the stage
without any training,

52:04.600 --> 52:07.680
and without probably
never being inside
a professional kitchen.

52:08.520 --> 52:10.480
He's impressed...
You know.

52:10.520 --> 52:15.200
I'm having
an internal conversation
with myself.

52:16.480 --> 52:18.760
But there's
no decision made.

52:18.800 --> 52:20.320
Or even close
to being made yet.

52:21.080 --> 52:22.760
[narrator] Lunch is over.

52:22.800 --> 52:25.120
Now the pressure
is on the investors.

52:25.160 --> 52:29.360
They have to decide
whether the ideas
are worth their money.

52:29.400 --> 52:31.280
I just wanna thank
everybody here today.

52:31.320 --> 52:33.560
Give everybody
a pat on the back.

52:33.600 --> 52:36.160
My gut feeling
is telling me that
I will get the investment,

52:36.200 --> 52:37.680
but let us see how it goes.

52:48.280 --> 52:50.440
[Fred] Hello. You okay?

52:50.480 --> 52:53.000
-How was service?
-We did our best.

52:53.040 --> 52:55.960
Good. Well, you know,
now the pressure
is on them.

52:56.680 --> 52:58.040
He's got a deadline.

52:58.080 --> 53:00.960
-He's gotta decide.
-He's got one hour
to come back.

53:01.000 --> 53:03.120
And if he comes
through that door,
in one hour,

53:03.160 --> 53:06.600
he will make you an offer,
if he doesn't, well, I'm afraid
there will be no investment.

53:14.200 --> 53:18.440
[narrator]
Lee and Faai came here
looking for £225,000.

53:18.480 --> 53:22.280
If Chris doesn't return
with an offer of investment
by 7:00 p.m.,

53:22.320 --> 53:23.600
they'll walk away
with nothing.

53:25.760 --> 53:27.840
[Fred] If he doesn't come back,

53:27.880 --> 53:31.080
do you think you have
to change your strategy?

53:31.120 --> 53:34.080
We put a lot of work
into it at this point,

53:34.120 --> 53:35.640
and I think if Chris
isn't interested,

53:35.680 --> 53:38.040
it doesn't necessarily mean
we need a change of strategy.

53:38.080 --> 53:40.200
If we keep getting a no
from here on in,

53:40.240 --> 53:42.920
then we'll definitely
have to look at
what we're doing wrong.

54:16.040 --> 54:17.200
He's not coming.

54:17.240 --> 54:18.680
Oh...

54:19.520 --> 54:21.720
Genuinely gutted.

54:21.760 --> 54:23.480
I'm disappointed.
I thought he was...

54:23.520 --> 54:24.920
I'm disappointed.

54:27.760 --> 54:31.440
I just think
it's not what
he's looking for, maybe.

54:34.680 --> 54:37.440
On paper, it was a great idea,
but in reality,

54:37.480 --> 54:40.520
out of the three key things
that I look for,

54:40.560 --> 54:43.320
which is an obsession
with product,

54:43.360 --> 54:46.240
scalability, and an excellent
management team,

54:46.280 --> 54:48.440
they had two out of three.

54:48.480 --> 54:53.440
The absolute obsession
and the magic in the food

54:53.480 --> 54:55.480
was just lacking a bit.

54:55.520 --> 54:58.480
The grab-and-go market
is very, very competitive

54:58.520 --> 55:01.120
and so, unfortunately
this time around
it's not for me.

55:01.160 --> 55:03.000
What do you think
is next for Greedy Khao?

55:03.040 --> 55:05.000
I think we've learned a lot
from this experience.

55:05.040 --> 55:07.960
We know at least
that our business plan
is solid.

55:08.000 --> 55:10.400
Chris obviously isn't
the right investor for us,

55:10.440 --> 55:14.000
but it does leave us
in a very good position
going forward.

55:14.040 --> 55:15.440
And I'm gonna
start reaching out

55:15.480 --> 55:18.840
to as many different
potential investors as I can.

55:18.880 --> 55:21.600
And we'll take it
from there, really.

55:21.640 --> 55:23.120
Good luck, guys.
Good luck.

55:27.160 --> 55:28.920
Well done.
You've done very well.

55:28.960 --> 55:30.080
-Thanks a bunch.
-You did.

55:39.680 --> 55:41.440
[narrator] Now it's
Prince's turn to wait.

55:45.760 --> 55:49.800
David and Scott have a deadline
of 8:00 p.m.to walk
through the door

55:49.840 --> 55:51.200
and make their offer.

55:53.440 --> 55:58.040
If they both come back,
Prince will have to choose
between competing investors.

55:59.480 --> 56:05.440
It's just, kind of, frustrating
a bit, being in a limbo.

56:05.480 --> 56:08.320
-Not knowing if
they're gonna come in or not.
-Yeah.

56:20.800 --> 56:23.880
Which investor do you prefer,
David or Scott?

56:23.920 --> 56:27.440
Um,
if I had a choice,
it'd probably be David.

56:27.480 --> 56:33.080
Like, he specializes
in building businesses
to its full potential.

56:56.480 --> 56:57.800
The time is up, Prince.

56:59.600 --> 57:01.600
They did not come.

57:01.640 --> 57:05.400
Obviously they probably
didn't feel like...

57:05.440 --> 57:10.480
It could be anything.
We just have to
just prove them wrong.

57:10.520 --> 57:12.520
[David]
Effectively,
if you're financing somebody,

57:12.560 --> 57:14.720
you gotta be pretty sure
you're gonna make
some money out of it.

57:14.760 --> 57:17.920
I'm not sure whether
there's any money
to be made

57:17.960 --> 57:20.400
by investing in Prince.

57:20.440 --> 57:23.520
He's obviously got
a successful business,
it's very admirable,

57:23.560 --> 57:26.440
and I'd like him
to keep in contact with me,

57:26.480 --> 57:28.880
and I'll be on the end
of the phone and
I'll give him some advice.

57:30.240 --> 57:31.800
It's gonna be okay.

57:31.840 --> 57:33.320
I'm good, man.

57:33.360 --> 57:35.040
I know, I know
you're good.

57:35.080 --> 57:38.960
The reason I didn't invest
was because Prince,

57:39.000 --> 57:42.280
although he's got
a very successful
burgeoning business,

57:42.320 --> 57:44.240
he's gonna need
a lot of work.

57:44.280 --> 57:46.120
And he needs
to learn a lot.

57:46.160 --> 57:49.560
Any investment, it needs
to have some sort of
hope of return

57:49.600 --> 57:54.040
and it would've taken up
a lot of my time
and effort and energy,

57:54.080 --> 57:55.120
which I don't have.

57:55.160 --> 57:56.760
I've got businesses
to run of my own.

57:56.800 --> 57:58.160
Shall we have a drink?

57:58.200 --> 57:59.080
Yeah, come now.

57:59.520 --> 58:01.080
Good.

58:01.120 --> 58:04.960
It wasn't really about
coming and getting money,

58:05.000 --> 58:06.640
um, it was just more about...

58:08.520 --> 58:10.040
Just learning,

58:10.080 --> 58:12.480
learning new things,
and I've definitely
learned new things

58:12.520 --> 58:14.560
and we're gonna keep doing
what we're doing

58:14.600 --> 58:16.360
and try to grow it
as big as we can

58:16.400 --> 58:20.880
and just keep
our head down,
and it's their loss, innit?

58:26.400 --> 58:28.000
[Fred] No investment
for Prince tonight.

58:28.040 --> 58:30.920
I felt for him,
he must've been
so disappointed.

58:30.960 --> 58:33.880
But he's a resilient man
and I believe in him.

58:33.920 --> 58:37.520
He built Trap Kitchen
out of nothing
from his mom's kitchen.

58:37.560 --> 58:41.320
And I have no doubt
he will find a way,
he will get what he wants.

58:44.480 --> 58:46.520
Essentially you're looking
at £18 for lunch.

58:46.560 --> 58:49.320
Do you think it has the
potential for people to pay
that sort of money?

58:49.360 --> 58:50.760
Yeah, I do, I think so.

58:50.800 --> 58:53.040
Is anyone listening to me?
Aubergine.

58:53.080 --> 58:54.920
Two seconds on your aubergine
I'll just see where it is.

58:54.960 --> 58:56.960
Still waiting on food
for Table 1.

58:57.000 --> 58:58.320
So I need
one more aubergine.

58:58.360 --> 58:59.800
-That's gone.
-They said they haven't had it.

58:59.840 --> 59:00.920
It's a £600,000 lunch.
