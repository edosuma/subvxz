WEBVTT

00:59.993 --> 01:02.329
[RuPaul] Previously
on RuPaul's Drag Race...

01:02.329 --> 01:04.932
We're playing
the Snatch Game At Sea.

01:04.932 --> 01:06.400
[cheers and applause]
Oh, my God!

01:06.400 --> 01:09.670
Is this bitch recording?

01:09.670 --> 01:11.471
[laughs]

01:11.471 --> 01:13.440
The only thing I've assaulted
is a cheese plate.

01:13.440 --> 01:14.808
[all laugh]

01:14.808 --> 01:16.643
Her joints are always wet.

01:18.879 --> 01:20.714
[RuPaul] Yvie Oddly.

01:20.714 --> 01:23.083
[Ross] Whoopi's a good choice
because we all know Whoopi

01:23.083 --> 01:25.419
and there's a lot there.
You brought none of that.

01:25.419 --> 01:27.120
[RuPaul] Brooke Lynn Hytes.

01:27.120 --> 01:28.956
The accent wasn't there.
The jokes weren't there.

01:28.956 --> 01:31.591
I just got a like a confused
realtor maybe from Toronto.

01:31.591 --> 01:34.561
[RuPaul] Silky Nutmeg Ganache,
con-drag-ulations.

01:34.561 --> 01:36.363
You are the winner
of this week's challenge.

01:36.363 --> 01:37.364
[applause]

01:37.364 --> 01:41.268
Ladies, shantay,
you both stay.

01:41.268 --> 01:42.636
[applause]

01:42.636 --> 01:46.773
We got a couple of lip sync
assassins in our presence.

01:46.773 --> 01:48.642
No one is safe.

01:55.015 --> 01:56.316
[sighs] Oops.

01:56.316 --> 01:57.751
[both laugh]

01:57.751 --> 02:00.287
[Plastique Tiara] Ru has saved
both Brooke Lynn and Yvie.

02:00.287 --> 02:02.589
You've got to give credit
where credit is due,

02:02.589 --> 02:06.326
because they did slay
the shit out of that lip sync.

02:06.326 --> 02:07.694
Oh.

02:07.694 --> 02:08.695
Oh, my God.

02:08.695 --> 02:09.997
How are you guys feeling?

02:09.997 --> 02:11.665
[Brooke Lynn]
I mean, I couldn't be mad,

02:11.665 --> 02:12.833
because I deserved
to be in the bottom two.

02:12.833 --> 02:14.034
There's no question about that.

02:14.034 --> 02:16.203
But you're an amazing person
to perform with,

02:16.203 --> 02:17.237
and it was fun.

02:17.237 --> 02:18.772
[Yvie] Yeah, exactly.

02:18.772 --> 02:21.174
I'm just glad that
I got another opportunity

02:21.174 --> 02:22.876
to show what I can do.

02:22.876 --> 02:25.946
The Snatch Game went
every bit as horribly for me

02:25.946 --> 02:29.783
as my worst nightmares.
[laughs]

02:29.783 --> 02:32.119
But to know
that I went up against

02:32.119 --> 02:33.787
the toughest lip syncer here

02:33.787 --> 02:38.191
and I'm still kicking
feels so good.

02:38.191 --> 02:41.161
What I learned today is that
you have to keep turning it

02:41.161 --> 02:42.896
because it really doesn't matter

02:42.896 --> 02:44.664
unless you're doing the best
any given week.

02:44.664 --> 02:46.933
[A'Keria] That's what I keep
trying to stress to y'all.

02:46.933 --> 02:49.002
At this point,
it's anybody's game.

02:49.002 --> 02:51.271
[Shuga Cain] With the exception
of Tyra and Trixie,

02:51.271 --> 02:53.273
everyone
that has won Drag Race

02:53.273 --> 02:55.609
has placed in the top
of Snatch Game.

02:55.609 --> 02:58.345
But besides Miss Silky,
Yvie and Brooke Lynn,

02:58.345 --> 02:59.713
they were some
of the frontrunners

02:59.713 --> 03:02.549
for this competition,
and they just bombed.

03:02.549 --> 03:05.919
So now it could be
anyone's game, really.

03:05.919 --> 03:07.287
[Vanjie] Silky, congratulations.

03:07.287 --> 03:08.955
Congrats, bitch.

03:08.955 --> 03:11.425
So you won the mini challenge
and the main challenge.

03:11.425 --> 03:12.859
[cheers]

03:12.859 --> 03:15.395
[Silky] I've won
two main challenges.

03:15.395 --> 03:18.765
Last week a bitch was telling me
that I was talentless,

03:18.765 --> 03:20.167
but I just won.

03:20.167 --> 03:21.268
See, God is good.

03:21.268 --> 03:24.337
Miss Yvie,
you reap what you sow.

03:24.337 --> 03:27.574
I do feel that because
all of us are still here,

03:27.574 --> 03:31.311
the pressure is definitely on.

03:31.311 --> 03:33.213
[Shuga] I'd like to know
from some of y'all,

03:33.213 --> 03:34.381
like now that the pressure's on,

03:34.381 --> 03:36.483
like what are you
going to do differently?

03:36.483 --> 03:38.385
[Silky] Nothing.

03:38.385 --> 03:40.487
I packed what I packed
to get here.

03:40.487 --> 03:43.323
At this point, I can't show
any more than Silky.

03:43.323 --> 03:45.859
And I did wonderful this week.

03:45.859 --> 03:48.228
So there's nothing else
I can show,

03:48.228 --> 03:49.729
but do what I'm supposed to do,

03:49.729 --> 03:52.866
and show why
I'm an exceptional drag queen.

03:52.866 --> 03:55.135
One thing I can say
about myself,

03:55.135 --> 03:58.105
if I'm going to be wrong, I'm
going to be committed and wrong.

03:58.105 --> 03:59.339
People don't like it.

03:59.339 --> 04:01.108
They talk about me,
say I'm talentless,

04:01.108 --> 04:03.844
but I don't give a fuck.
I am here.

04:03.844 --> 04:08.281
The Bible say speak it plain
and watch it pass.

04:08.281 --> 04:09.883
I done spoke it plain.

04:09.883 --> 04:13.420
Lord will make your enemy
your footstool. Miss Yvie.

04:13.420 --> 04:16.089
[Brooke Lynn] And on that note,
let's get out of drag.

04:16.089 --> 04:18.191
-Let's get out of here.
-Yay.

04:18.191 --> 04:19.926
[Shuga] I'm actually shocked

04:19.926 --> 04:23.296
that Silky thinks she can't
do anything to better herself.

04:23.296 --> 04:24.898
Yeah, she's doing amazing,

04:24.898 --> 04:27.734
but like at some point,
it's not going to be enough.

04:27.734 --> 04:30.337
If you're not willing to
address the judges' critiques,

04:30.337 --> 04:32.939
I can't see you
getting into the top four.

04:32.939 --> 04:35.742
You have to be able
to adapt and adjust.

04:35.742 --> 04:37.544
If you can't do that,
there's no way.

It's a new morning.
We're still eight queens.

I always try to come
from a place of love,

05:33.500 --> 05:35.101
but sometimes you just
have to break it down

05:53.520 --> 05:56.656
I'd like to use

I'll take those, thank you.

Because you won't get the crown.

Oh, so I see.
You have to explain the reading.

-I'm sorry.
-Oh, okay.

06:27.087 --> 06:30.257
Oh, Shuga Cain, Shuga Cain.

what can I say?

07:21.675 --> 07:24.277
Fossilized prehistoric drag.

07:24.277 --> 07:26.713
I'm sending you
to a retirement home, grandma.

you're not wearing sandals,

zooming into those feet.

and not your personality,

to hit the road with you.

08:07.454 --> 08:09.255
It wasn't until I saw that ass

08:09.255 --> 08:11.591

the meaning of a drug mule.

you got people in Somalia

[all laugh]

08:24.871 --> 08:26.506
Silk with the good milk.

08:26.506 --> 08:28.775
The only good thing
about your milk

08:28.775 --> 08:31.244
is that it has
an expiration date.

08:31.244 --> 08:34.414
[all laugh]

08:34.414 --> 08:37.283
Speaking of expiration dates,
ain't yours coming soon?

08:37.283 --> 08:38.885
[all laugh]

08:38.885 --> 08:42.055
I think this is the first time
we've had a reading challenge

08:42.055 --> 08:44.324
where the people being read
read back.

08:44.324 --> 08:46.393
Read back.
We coming for the girls.

08:46.393 --> 08:48.661

-Hi.

08:48.661 --> 08:49.662
I'm looking for a new apartment.

08:49.662 --> 08:50.764
How much are you charging

between your ears?

-Shuga Cain.
-Yeah.

I'm redoing my fireplace
and I'm short a brick.

08:58.705 --> 09:00.273
Can I borrow your face?

09:00.273 --> 09:03.243
[all laugh]

09:03.243 --> 09:05.545
-Miss Vanjie.
-Don't get the divorce papers.

09:05.545 --> 09:07.547
Now, the real reason
I keep kissing you

09:07.547 --> 09:10.483
is because it's the only way
to get you to shut the fuck up.

09:10.483 --> 09:12.218
I'll take that.

09:12.218 --> 09:15.221

-Yes.

-Hi, sis.

09:25.965 --> 09:28.435
Girl, your drag is beautiful,
I must admit.

09:28.435 --> 09:30.537
But what is it worth
when it's all rented?

But this season,
all you're leaving with

09:40.079 --> 09:41.548
is Brooke Lynn's last name.

your lips, your body,
or those shoes.

Give 'em to the faithful.

09:54.527 --> 09:57.096
Miss RuPaul.

09:57.096 --> 09:58.098
Oh, shit.

09:58.098 --> 10:00.433
$100.000.
[all laugh]

10:00.433 --> 10:01.534
It's going to be real nice.

10:01.534 --> 10:03.703
We be up in here working

10:03.703 --> 10:05.538
and waiting on you at the door

10:05.538 --> 10:10.109
so you can come in
and say hello, hello, hello.

10:10.109 --> 10:12.712
[all laugh]
What was that?

10:12.712 --> 10:13.980
Y'all edit that out.
Edit that out.

10:13.980 --> 10:15.448
That was horrible.

10:15.448 --> 10:16.649
[Vanjie]
We don't need that.

10:16.649 --> 10:19.385
Miss Plastique Tiara.

10:19.385 --> 10:22.255
I'm truly surprised
that you're still here, boo-boo.

10:22.255 --> 10:25.425
But I think for us all,
your elimination need to come.

10:25.425 --> 10:26.759
Haiku, haiku.

10:26.759 --> 10:29.095
[all laugh]

10:29.095 --> 10:30.630
What's that mean, bitch?

10:30.630 --> 10:33.132
What the fuck does that mean?

10:33.132 --> 10:35.502
It's her being Japanese, bitch.
Hurry and go home.

10:35.502 --> 10:37.203
I'm not Japanese.

10:37.203 --> 10:39.806
Do I have your permission
to use a footnote?

10:39.806 --> 10:41.307
Yes. Footnote.

10:41.307 --> 10:43.643
-[all laugh]
-Okay good.

10:43.643 --> 10:45.311
[Vanjie] Girl, get the knees.

10:45.311 --> 10:48.615
Literally a footnote.

10:48.615 --> 10:51.384
Take your time.
It's only a 90 minute show.

10:51.384 --> 10:53.753
[all laugh]
This is good, bitch.

10:53.753 --> 10:56.289
Aah! Hai!

10:56.289 --> 10:58.625
Can you bring the volume down
a little?

10:58.625 --> 11:00.159
And also make it funny.

11:00.159 --> 11:02.228
You better shut up,
you eighties looking porn star.

11:02.228 --> 11:05.164
[all laugh]

11:05.164 --> 11:08.134
Roses are red, violets are blue.

11:08.134 --> 11:11.304
Your Celine Dion
was shit, boo-boo.

11:11.304 --> 11:13.806
[all laugh]

11:13.806 --> 11:18.111
Miss Silky Nutmeg Ganache.

11:18.111 --> 11:22.015
Yes, you are fat.
Yes, your hair is nappy.

11:22.015 --> 11:24.417
But, bitch,
if y'all run up on me,

11:24.417 --> 11:25.919
I'm gonna get real chappy.

11:25.919 --> 11:27.520
What up, ho?
What up, ho?

11:27.520 --> 11:29.622
What up, bitch?

11:29.622 --> 11:32.692
That's wasn't a read.
You just threatening us, bitch.

11:32.692 --> 11:34.027
[all laugh]

11:34.027 --> 11:38.264
Well, ladies, the library
has not only been closed,

11:38.264 --> 11:39.832
it is now condemned.

11:39.832 --> 11:42.001
[all laugh]

11:42.001 --> 11:44.237
The winner of today's
Mini Challenge is...

11:46.839 --> 11:49.943
Brooke Lynn Hytes.
[cheers and applause]

11:49.943 --> 11:52.879
You'll receive
a $2.500 gift card

11:52.879 --> 11:54.447
from l.a. Eyeworks.

11:54.447 --> 11:56.916
[cheers and applause]

11:56.916 --> 11:59.619
Ladies,
for today's Maxi Challenge,

11:59.619 --> 12:03.356
you need to flex
your comedy improv muscles

12:03.356 --> 12:08.027
as you fight the law
in TV's newest guilty pleasure:

12:08.027 --> 12:11.898
LADP, Los Angeles Drag Patrol.

12:11.898 --> 12:13.566
[all laugh]

12:13.566 --> 12:14.867
#DragRace.

12:14.867 --> 12:19.005
Now, you'll be working
in pairs of perps.

12:19.005 --> 12:20.440
Now, Brooke Lynn,
you won the mini challenge,

12:20.440 --> 12:22.909
so you get to pick
your partner in crime

12:22.909 --> 12:25.411
and pair up the other queens.

12:25.411 --> 12:26.679
Oh, shit.

12:26.679 --> 12:29.349
[Shuga] Not gonna lie,
I get a little nervous,

12:29.349 --> 12:30.683
'cause there's
a little shady lady

12:30.683 --> 12:32.018
happening somewhere in there.

12:32.018 --> 12:35.021
So, Brooke Lynn,
who do you choose for yourself?

12:36.923 --> 12:38.758
I'm going to choose
Miss Nina West.

12:38.758 --> 12:40.059
[Nina] Thank you.

12:40.059 --> 12:42.395
I didn't pick Vanjie
as my partner

12:42.395 --> 12:44.130
because Vanjie's great
at being Vanjie.

12:44.130 --> 12:46.165
I wouldn't say Vanjie's
a wonderful actor.

12:46.165 --> 12:48.835
I picked Nina because
Nina's great at acting.

12:48.835 --> 12:50.303
She's great at improv.

12:50.303 --> 12:51.604
And I know she can
kind of really help me

12:51.604 --> 12:52.772
and guide me through this,

12:52.772 --> 12:54.307
because this is something
I'm not good at.

12:54.307 --> 12:56.376
Who are you going
to pair up next?

12:56.376 --> 13:00.279
Vanessa Vanjie Mateo
and Plastique Tiara.

13:02.148 --> 13:04.117
Wait, is this bitch even funny?

13:04.117 --> 13:05.985
Next?

13:05.985 --> 13:10.556
A'Keria C. Davenport
and Yvie Oddly.

13:10.556 --> 13:14.027
[RuPaul] That's means
Silky Nutmeg Ganache

13:14.027 --> 13:15.895
will be working with Shuga Cain.

13:15.895 --> 13:17.296
The sweets are together, honey.

13:17.296 --> 13:18.765
We got it, girl.

13:18.765 --> 13:21.701
[Yvie] Brooke Lynn is splitting
all the strongest players

13:21.701 --> 13:23.002
because she knows

13:23.002 --> 13:25.371
that if she put like,
two good actresses together,

13:25.371 --> 13:26.939
that she wouldn't have a chance

13:26.939 --> 13:30.176
of getting anywhere
in this challenge.

13:30.176 --> 13:33.212
I can tell that she's really
trying to rig this in her favor.

13:33.212 --> 13:34.747
A'Keria and Yvie,

13:34.747 --> 13:39.552
you'll be playing two twerking
girls caught in the act.

13:39.552 --> 13:41.788
Ow.
[all laugh]

13:41.788 --> 13:43.156
[RuPaul] Brooke Lynn and Nina,

13:43.156 --> 13:47.260
you'll be playing two feuding
trailer park neighbors.

13:47.260 --> 13:49.195
Oh.

13:49.195 --> 13:51.097
[RuPaul] Vanjie and Plastique,

13:51.097 --> 13:55.001
you'll be playing two queens
caught in a catfight.

13:55.001 --> 13:56.169
Literally.

13:56.169 --> 13:58.404
-Ooh.
-Ooh.

13:58.404 --> 14:02.375
Silky and Shuga,
you'll be playing two queens

14:02.375 --> 14:06.979
accused of buying and selling
back alley butt pads.

14:06.979 --> 14:08.781
[all laugh]

14:08.781 --> 14:10.616
I'm a bootleg queen, honey.

14:10.616 --> 14:13.653
Gentlemen,
start your engines,

14:13.653 --> 14:16.289
and may the best woman win.

14:16.289 --> 14:19.225
[cheers and applause]
Don't let the po-po get you.

14:19.225 --> 14:20.560
[all laugh]

14:22.929 --> 14:24.564
-All right?
-All right. Here we go.

14:24.564 --> 14:25.865
[Nina] This week's
Maxi Challenge

14:25.865 --> 14:28.901
is an improv acting challenge
called LADP.

14:28.901 --> 14:30.837
L.A. Drag Patrol.

14:30.837 --> 14:32.138
Last time we had
an improv challenge,

14:32.138 --> 14:34.674
I actually won,
so I'm really excited

14:34.674 --> 14:36.075
to really flex
those muscles again.

14:36.075 --> 14:38.911
"Indecent exposure
at the trailer park.

14:38.911 --> 14:40.580
"An uptight nosy neighbor
calls the cops

14:40.580 --> 14:43.249
on her hippy dippy nearly naked
sunbathing neighbor."

14:43.249 --> 14:45.084
I'm kind of drawn to sunbather.

14:45.084 --> 14:47.320
I was, too.

14:47.320 --> 14:50.323
I was thinking for the physical
comedy of me being naked.

14:50.323 --> 14:53.893
Mm-hmm. Yeah. Okay.

14:53.893 --> 14:55.728
So you're going to do
the sunbather.

14:55.728 --> 14:57.196
I like that.

14:57.196 --> 14:59.599
I think this is a really good
role reversal for us, too,

14:59.599 --> 15:01.601
because I'm really uptight

15:01.601 --> 15:03.836
and you're really free so...

15:03.836 --> 15:05.404
Yeah.

15:05.404 --> 15:06.739
I'm just nervous in general

15:06.739 --> 15:09.475
because we all know my history
with acting challenges.

15:09.475 --> 15:11.377
It just has to be really goofy,

15:11.377 --> 15:14.280
and like the most
ridiculous thing ever.

15:14.280 --> 15:16.382
I think I have an ability
to really coach Brooke

15:16.382 --> 15:17.583
and help her through this,

15:17.583 --> 15:19.185
because she's not
the strongest actor.

15:19.185 --> 15:21.921
I'm a little nervous,
because I know how I am,

15:21.921 --> 15:24.157
and I feel like I might worry
about Brooke Lynn a little bit

15:24.157 --> 15:27.026
and try to tend to her needs
more so than mine.

15:27.026 --> 15:29.996
I gotta be honest.
I would rather do the sunbather.

15:29.996 --> 15:32.431
Let's do it.
Let's do it. Let's do it.

15:32.431 --> 15:34.000
I just feel like
now is not the time

15:34.000 --> 15:37.703
for us to role reverse
or step out of our comfort zone.

15:37.703 --> 15:39.005
Okay. Let's start over.

15:39.005 --> 15:40.873
This is a group challenge,

15:40.873 --> 15:43.743
and I have to ensure that
my partner feels comfortable,

15:43.743 --> 15:46.512
so that I feel comfortable,
so that we can have success.

15:46.512 --> 15:47.980
Sorry, this is totally
fucking you up.

15:47.980 --> 15:50.383
It's just
I have to start thinking

15:50.383 --> 15:51.651
about character development.

15:51.651 --> 15:54.687
So I just want
to figure that out.

15:54.687 --> 15:56.422
Hey, cysts.

15:56.422 --> 15:58.057
-Hey.
-Hi.

15:58.057 --> 15:59.292
I'm gonna need to see

15:59.292 --> 16:01.828
your driver's license
and registration.

16:01.828 --> 16:04.030
[all laugh]
It's expired.

16:04.030 --> 16:06.766
Hey, Shuga.
Hey, Dr. Ganache.

16:06.766 --> 16:07.967
-Hey.
-Hi.

16:07.967 --> 16:09.168
How's it going so far?

16:09.168 --> 16:10.870
It's good.
We assigned our characters,

16:10.870 --> 16:13.172
and we're just trying to work
through what our story is.

16:13.172 --> 16:15.308
Are you basing
your character on someone?

16:15.308 --> 16:16.809
I don't know
if you know the time

16:16.809 --> 16:19.412
when bootleg CDs
were, you know, available,

16:19.412 --> 16:21.113
and people would be selling them
out their trunks

16:21.113 --> 16:22.181
for real, for real.

16:22.181 --> 16:23.449
-Yeah, the boosters.
-Yeah.

16:23.449 --> 16:27.086
So you have bought bootleg items
from the trunk of a car.

16:27.086 --> 16:28.120
That's allegedly.

16:28.120 --> 16:29.255
Allegedly.

16:29.255 --> 16:31.490
I'll take that as a yes.

16:31.490 --> 16:32.758
I don't know.

16:32.758 --> 16:36.128
[RuPaul] Now, Silky,
you won last week.

16:36.128 --> 16:37.697
How are you going
to top yourself?

16:37.697 --> 16:41.968
Well, that's kind of hard to top
myself, if you think about it.

16:41.968 --> 16:43.870
I'd kind of like to see you try.

16:43.870 --> 16:46.339
I know, right?
I love improv.

16:46.339 --> 16:48.674
I'm not an actor by any means,

16:48.674 --> 16:51.344
but, you know, like with this,
I am that seller.

16:51.344 --> 16:52.912
It's kind of what I give,
you know.

16:52.912 --> 16:54.447
Even when I know
something is bad, you know,

16:54.447 --> 16:55.815
I'm still gonna sell it.

16:55.815 --> 16:58.384
They say I could sell ice water
to an eskimo, honey.

16:58.384 --> 16:59.886
[RuPaul] I love that.

16:59.886 --> 17:01.687
So, Shuga, tell me
about your character.

17:01.687 --> 17:04.790
My character
is the disgruntled customer.

17:04.790 --> 17:07.126
She's mad because
she got these lumpy pads.

17:07.126 --> 17:09.161
Are you basing it
on someone you know?

17:09.161 --> 17:12.632
I kind of was thinking
of that movie White Chicks,

17:12.632 --> 17:14.901
those two white girls
that are in there.

17:14.901 --> 17:16.202
Yeah. Well, you know,
those are black dudes.

17:16.202 --> 17:19.171
Well, yeah. [laughs]

17:19.171 --> 17:20.573
In the diva worship challenge,

17:20.573 --> 17:22.275
you had a little issue

17:22.275 --> 17:25.711
with sort of expanding
on your character.

17:25.711 --> 17:28.514
How are you going to make
that work in this challenge?

17:28.514 --> 17:30.716
I'm trying to really like just
prepare who this character is

17:30.716 --> 17:32.852
so I can have more fun.
especially with Silk,

17:32.852 --> 17:35.154
because she's got
such a big personality.

17:35.154 --> 17:36.822
Right.

17:36.822 --> 17:38.691
[Plastique]
I'm a little worried for Shuga.

17:38.691 --> 17:41.427
She could get overshadowed
really easily.

17:41.427 --> 17:44.397
She's always
the good, supportive role.

17:44.397 --> 17:45.932
She's never the star.

17:45.932 --> 17:47.133
[Silky] Don't overthink it.

17:47.133 --> 17:49.068
Don't be afraid
to make a fool of yourself.

17:49.068 --> 17:50.336
Yeah.

17:50.336 --> 17:52.004
Bitch, we only here
for a short period of time.

17:52.004 --> 17:53.406
That's true.
I got you, bitch.

17:53.406 --> 17:55.074
[Shuga] I know
that I'm talented,

17:55.074 --> 17:56.809
and I'm working
really, really hard.

17:56.809 --> 17:59.345
But at times I feel like, I
don't know if it's not enough,

17:59.345 --> 18:02.715
or it's just not what
the judges are looking for.

18:02.715 --> 18:04.383
I just don't want
to get lost in the mix.

18:04.383 --> 18:07.219
Hi, Plastique.
Hi, Vanjie.

18:07.219 --> 18:08.220
-Hi.
-Hi, Ru.

18:08.220 --> 18:09.655
Do you know
what your character is?

18:09.655 --> 18:11.324
I'm going to be Theater Cat,

18:11.324 --> 18:13.159
so I'm going to be
like over-dramatic,

18:13.159 --> 18:14.660
a little bit delusional.

18:14.660 --> 18:15.928
I think that I'm the prettiest.

18:15.928 --> 18:17.430
No, she's delusional.

18:17.430 --> 18:20.333
Are you going to do
your Vietnamese accent again?

18:20.333 --> 18:22.101
Not this challenge.

18:22.101 --> 18:23.269
I know that you love it,

18:23.269 --> 18:24.370
but I'm not going to do it
this challenge.

18:24.370 --> 18:25.738
Is she allowed to?

18:25.738 --> 18:27.273
[laughs]

18:27.273 --> 18:28.841
Because I might
have the bitch do it.

18:28.841 --> 18:30.276
-[laughs]
-It's been working.

18:30.276 --> 18:31.811
Well, we've seen it a lot.

18:31.811 --> 18:34.847
You're Theater Cat,
and you're what cat?

18:34.847 --> 18:36.315
-Alley Cat.
-Oh, Alley Cat.

18:36.315 --> 18:37.750
She's street smart.

18:37.750 --> 18:39.385
Like, she done been through
a lot of hard shit,

18:39.385 --> 18:40.653
that type of thing.

18:40.653 --> 18:41.754
Yeah. Now, listen,

18:41.754 --> 18:43.756
everyone knows
that you're very funny,

18:43.756 --> 18:46.559
but can you be funny
in a structured scene?

18:46.559 --> 18:47.760
[Vanjie]
That's what I was telling her,

18:47.760 --> 18:49.061
that I want to make sure

18:49.061 --> 18:51.797
I don't just go from
the moment the cops arrive

18:51.797 --> 18:54.000
from, you know, are at 10.

18:54.000 --> 18:56.202
It needs to be like a--

18:56.202 --> 18:57.303
A gradual build.

18:57.303 --> 18:58.738
That's the word. Gradual.

18:58.738 --> 19:01.574
I can't help the fact
that I go into things at a 10.

19:01.574 --> 19:02.975
You know
I'm just happy to be here.

19:02.975 --> 19:05.444
And my personality
is what got me here.

19:05.444 --> 19:08.681
I'm just trying to figure out
to, you know, organize it.

19:08.681 --> 19:10.716
I didn't--

19:13.986 --> 19:18.024
I want to see that
you can harness the Vanjie,

19:18.024 --> 19:19.191
and be able to do it on cue.

19:19.191 --> 19:20.393
-Yeah.
-And you, too.

19:20.393 --> 19:21.827
You know, you need
to come out of your shell.

19:21.827 --> 19:23.362
Let it go.

19:23.362 --> 19:24.764
This is where you do it.

19:24.764 --> 19:26.699
-Okay.
-No holding back.

19:26.699 --> 19:27.800
You have a tall order.

19:27.800 --> 19:28.934
[Vanjie] I ain't gonna lie.

19:28.934 --> 19:31.537
I am worried that Miss Plastique

19:31.537 --> 19:33.439
is not going
to be able to deliver,

19:33.439 --> 19:35.508
because this is not
her strength.

19:35.508 --> 19:37.410
No Tee.
We already know this.

19:37.410 --> 19:42.081
And I got an anchor
possibly might pull me down.

19:42.081 --> 19:43.549
All right,
I'll see you out there.

19:43.549 --> 19:44.750
-Yes.
-Thank you so much.

19:44.750 --> 19:45.851
-We're going to make you proud.
-Thank you, Ru.

19:45.851 --> 19:48.654
Hi, A'Keria.
Hi, Yvie.

19:48.654 --> 19:50.056
Roll on in there, Ru.

19:50.056 --> 19:51.123
Yvie and A'Keria.

19:51.123 --> 19:52.525
That sounds like
a sitcom already.

19:52.525 --> 19:53.793
I mean, we're ready.

19:53.793 --> 19:55.127
[RuPaul] You know,
you have a lot to prove

19:55.127 --> 19:56.195
after that Whoopi Goldberg
in Snatch Game.

19:56.195 --> 19:58.064
Oh, my God.
Oh, yeah.

19:58.064 --> 20:00.599
Failure is an opportunity
to learn.

20:00.599 --> 20:03.102
What do you think
the failure was?

20:03.102 --> 20:04.236
The failure for me was

20:04.236 --> 20:07.073
I was really trying
to be super calculated.

20:07.073 --> 20:09.141
I was, like, in my head

20:09.141 --> 20:11.577
trying to think about
what Whoopi would say,

20:11.577 --> 20:13.746
and also like
if this is Whoopi,

20:13.746 --> 20:15.681
and like am I saying enough?

20:15.681 --> 20:17.349
-I was attacking myself.
-It just wasn't any fun.

20:17.349 --> 20:20.052
I wasn't having fun at all.

20:20.052 --> 20:23.222
[Yvie] I'm a little bit frazzled

20:23.222 --> 20:27.059
'cause I just did really poorly
acting as someone else.

20:27.059 --> 20:30.663
But I just have to like
dust off that bad juju,

20:30.663 --> 20:33.065
and show the judges
I'm not a fluke.

20:33.065 --> 20:35.434
And A'Keria, you've seen
those things on the interweb

20:35.434 --> 20:38.571
where people are talking about,
ain't nobody got time for that.

20:38.571 --> 20:39.705
Uh-huh.

20:39.705 --> 20:41.073
And excuse my beauty.

20:41.073 --> 20:42.308
Hide your kids,
hide your wife.

20:42.308 --> 20:43.375
All that good stuff.

20:43.375 --> 20:44.577
That's right.

20:44.577 --> 20:46.078
How you gonna come up
with these moments?

20:46.078 --> 20:47.413
When you're having fun,

20:47.413 --> 20:49.682
when you know whatever
your base of your story is,

20:49.682 --> 20:53.052
and you can have fun from
that point, it just flowing out.

20:53.052 --> 20:55.154
I'm nervous for A'Keria, because
I don't feel like A'Keria

20:55.154 --> 20:59.458
ever gives the energy,
like, pow,

20:59.458 --> 21:01.360
balls to the walls.

21:01.360 --> 21:04.463
I'm looking for you opening up,
saying yes to everything.

21:04.463 --> 21:05.498
Yes.

21:05.498 --> 21:07.733
And be funny
for crying out loud.

21:07.733 --> 21:09.802
[laughs]

21:09.802 --> 21:11.237
All right, can't wait
to see you out there.

21:11.237 --> 21:13.939
-Thank you, Ru.
-All right, thank you.

21:13.939 --> 21:16.642
Hi, Nina.
Hi, Brooke Lynn.

21:16.642 --> 21:18.010
-Hi. How are you?
-Hi, Ru.

21:18.010 --> 21:20.713
So, now, Brooke Lynn,
another improv storyline.

21:20.713 --> 21:21.947
Are you scared?

21:21.947 --> 21:24.717
Yes, I am, but I'm going
to have a good time.

21:24.717 --> 21:26.018
Okay, I heard you say that

21:26.018 --> 21:28.654
when you were going to do
Celine Dion, too.

21:28.654 --> 21:29.889
Did you have a good time
with Celine Dion?

21:29.889 --> 21:31.991
I had so much fun.
Didn't you?

21:31.991 --> 21:34.927
[laughs]
No. I didn't.

21:34.927 --> 21:36.262
[all laugh]

21:36.262 --> 21:37.797
[Brooke Lynn]
Well, I picked a great partner.

21:37.797 --> 21:39.632
Nina is great at improv,

21:39.632 --> 21:41.300
and she can kind of
help guide me

21:41.300 --> 21:44.203
and give me pointers on how I
can make this better for myself.

21:44.203 --> 21:46.305
Now, you pairing
the other girls up,

21:46.305 --> 21:48.307
was there any shade
going on there?

21:48.307 --> 21:50.109
I kind of tried to match up
personalities,

21:50.109 --> 21:51.777
like someone who had
a bigger personality

21:51.777 --> 21:54.213
with someone who had
not as much of a personality

21:54.213 --> 21:55.948
so they could
kind of work together.

21:55.948 --> 21:57.850
Girl, you trying to say
I don't have personality?

21:57.850 --> 21:59.285
Celine Dion?

21:59.285 --> 22:00.452
With your dance background,

22:00.452 --> 22:02.755
how can you incorporate
what you know about dance,

22:02.755 --> 22:06.025
and what you've learned
from dance into this character?

22:06.025 --> 22:07.293
Well, we've talked before

22:07.293 --> 22:08.861
about getting, finding a rhythm
with the character.

22:08.861 --> 22:11.330
So I'm actually going
to incorporate movement,

22:11.330 --> 22:13.899
a lot of kind of...

22:13.899 --> 22:15.935
Well, I mean,
that's the kind of thinking

22:15.935 --> 22:17.937
that all of you girls
should be thinking about.

22:17.937 --> 22:20.606
Like, how do I take
what I do and make it work

22:20.606 --> 22:22.074
for one of the challenges.
-And turn it into this.

22:22.074 --> 22:24.310
And you're talking about you
with no personality.

22:24.310 --> 22:26.579
-You better find one.
-Yeah.

22:26.579 --> 22:29.148
And you, bitch, you've been at
this since after the Civil War.

22:29.148 --> 22:31.183
-Yes, mama. Yeah.
-Something like that.

22:31.183 --> 22:32.484
More, more, give me more.

22:32.484 --> 22:33.485
-All right.
-Give me more.

22:33.485 --> 22:34.486
What did Britney Spears say?

22:34.486 --> 22:35.688
Gimme more.

22:35.688 --> 22:37.356
-That's right. I want more.
-Gimme more.

22:37.356 --> 22:38.624
I will see you out there.

22:38.624 --> 22:40.859
And y'all--and the po-po
gonna be after your ass.

22:40.859 --> 22:42.628
-Thank you.
-All right.

22:42.628 --> 22:44.563
Thank you, Ru.

22:44.563 --> 22:46.665
All right, ladies,
gather round.

22:47.666 --> 22:49.535
Now, in a few moments,

22:49.535 --> 22:54.106
you'll be improving
with two of LADP's finest.

22:54.106 --> 22:56.108
The hilarious Fortune Feimster.

22:56.108 --> 22:57.409
[cheers and applause]

22:57.409 --> 23:01.614
And the arrestingly handsome
Cheyenne Jackson.

23:01.614 --> 23:04.016
[cheers and applause]

23:04.016 --> 23:05.718
Handcuff me to that!

23:05.718 --> 23:10.022
[RuPaul] Now, good luck,
and don't ferk it erp.

23:10.022 --> 23:13.592
-By-ee.
-By-ee.

23:13.592 --> 23:15.461
[Announcer]
LADP is filmed on location

23:15.461 --> 23:17.663
with the men and women
of law enforcement.

23:17.663 --> 23:18.931
All suspects are innocent

23:18.931 --> 23:20.332
until proven guilty
in a court of law.

23:20.332 --> 23:22.868
[siren]

23:22.868 --> 23:26.171
[Feimster]
Now, Officer Jackson,

23:26.171 --> 23:28.374
I know that you have not
been on the beat very long,

23:28.374 --> 23:32.144
so we might run into
some scoundrels.

23:32.144 --> 23:33.412
I'll just take your lead.

23:33.412 --> 23:35.347
[Feimster]
Yeah, you follow my lead.

23:35.347 --> 23:37.349
If anyone starts running,
you chase them.

23:37.349 --> 23:38.584
Okay.

23:38.584 --> 23:41.487
And I will be on the walkie
if you need me.

23:43.555 --> 23:46.225
[RuPaul]
911. What's your she-mergency?

23:46.225 --> 23:47.726
[chatter]

23:47.726 --> 23:49.328
Back alley butt pads?

23:49.328 --> 23:50.496
[chatter]

23:50.496 --> 23:52.097
How much did you pay?
[chatter]

23:52.097 --> 23:54.333
That's crazy.
My cousin Tenisha

23:54.333 --> 23:56.669
will get you that shit
for half price.

23:56.669 --> 23:59.738
One Madam 12, we got a 169

23:59.738 --> 24:04.276
at the corner of Stacy Lane
and Backroads Boulevard.

24:04.276 --> 24:06.078
-Okay.
-Show time.

24:06.078 --> 24:09.081
[siren]

24:09.081 --> 24:11.083
[Silky] Hip pad.

24:11.083 --> 24:12.618
Come on over to my truck, baby.

24:12.618 --> 24:14.119
How you doing, girl?

24:14.119 --> 24:15.888
I know you want something
up here. Ha!

24:15.888 --> 24:17.189
Come get these
good old hip pads--

24:17.189 --> 24:19.491
Oh, I got a new customer coming.

24:19.491 --> 24:20.859
[siren]
Hey, oh.

24:20.859 --> 24:23.562
I'm about to get some of that
government money today.

24:23.562 --> 24:25.030
-Good evening, ma'am.
-How you doing?

24:25.030 --> 24:26.298
We received a complaint about--

24:26.298 --> 24:27.299
[Silky] A complaint?

24:27.299 --> 24:29.034
About some bogus butt pads.

24:29.034 --> 24:30.069
Can you tell me
anything about that?

24:30.069 --> 24:31.370
You mean like
you need some hip pads.

24:31.370 --> 24:32.538
Turn around, let me see.

24:32.538 --> 24:33.906
Oh, I don't have a lot.

24:33.906 --> 24:36.508
Oh, you white, honey.
I got this just for you.

24:36.508 --> 24:38.344
[all laugh]

24:38.344 --> 24:40.179
Can you explain to me
what these are here?

24:40.179 --> 24:41.580
-You got a wife?
-I do.

24:41.580 --> 24:44.283
You want your wife
to look like Beyoncé?

24:44.283 --> 24:46.051
-Sure.
-Kim Kardashian?

24:46.051 --> 24:47.820
-Yes.
-You want Kim Kardashian,

24:47.820 --> 24:48.987
she got an extra filling.

24:48.987 --> 24:50.255
You gotta put that in with it.

24:50.255 --> 24:51.757
Ma'am, are these legal?

24:51.757 --> 24:55.294
Honey, you been working all day.

24:55.294 --> 24:56.762
I'm gonna give you
a nice piece of hot chicken.

24:56.762 --> 24:57.763
Oh.

24:57.763 --> 24:58.764
So you like chicken, don't you?

24:58.764 --> 25:00.733
-I--I do.
-I can tell your type.

25:00.733 --> 25:02.701
Officer, officers,
this is the woman

25:02.701 --> 25:03.769
that I've been telling about.

25:03.769 --> 25:06.338
This is the one that called.

25:06.338 --> 25:08.340
She done sold me
these busted hip pads.

25:08.340 --> 25:10.676
I'm trying to get
my groove back.

25:10.676 --> 25:11.744
I'm a widow.

25:11.744 --> 25:13.278
And she she gave me
these hip pads.

25:13.278 --> 25:14.713
Child, listen.

25:14.713 --> 25:17.149
I was with my young man,
and he--

25:17.149 --> 25:19.017
a chicken fell out
of my hip pad.

25:19.017 --> 25:20.285
-Oh!
-You know what?

25:20.285 --> 25:21.587
I think we're going
to have to search her.

25:21.587 --> 25:23.589
-Okay, I'd like you to--
-Ooh.

25:23.589 --> 25:24.723
[Feimster]
Did you just come from church?

25:24.723 --> 25:26.759
I did. Well, I was--

25:26.759 --> 25:28.160
She ain't come from church.
She's a ho.

25:29.628 --> 25:31.563
You gotta take me out on a date
before you do this, honey.

25:31.563 --> 25:32.664
I'll be patting you down, ma'am.

25:32.664 --> 25:34.400
-Okay, there's something--
-Ooh!

25:34.400 --> 25:35.868
Be careful
what's under there.

25:37.903 --> 25:40.205
See? That's what
she put in there.

25:40.205 --> 25:41.774
Ma'am, does this iron
belong to you?

25:41.774 --> 25:43.809
No, it belongs
to the Holiday Inn.

25:43.809 --> 25:45.811
[all laugh]

25:45.811 --> 25:48.447
-Okay, is this, uh...
-Oh, I'm gonna--

25:48.447 --> 25:50.616
That's for finger licking,
not booty stuffing.

25:50.616 --> 25:52.818
-Oh, you got that--
-No, Officer, don't--

25:52.818 --> 25:54.453
-Oh.
-Yeah, she did that.

25:54.453 --> 25:56.622
Hey, it's warm.

25:56.622 --> 25:58.824
You need to give me this $20
I've been asking for.

25:58.824 --> 26:00.859
Bitch, if you keep
talking to me crazy,

26:00.859 --> 26:03.429
I'm gonna have to whoop
your motherfucking ass.

26:03.429 --> 26:04.630
Give me my money, bitch.

26:04.630 --> 26:07.566
[all shouting at once]

26:08.901 --> 26:11.804
If you won't give me
this money today--

26:11.804 --> 26:13.572
Oh! Oh!

26:13.572 --> 26:16.508
-What are they doing to me?
-Come on.

26:16.508 --> 26:17.776
Get it. Get it.

26:17.776 --> 26:19.478
Ma'am, ma'am.

26:19.478 --> 26:20.979
Aah!

26:20.979 --> 26:22.448
No, no, no, no, no. Okay.

26:22.448 --> 26:25.150
Aah!

26:25.150 --> 26:26.351
I'm gonna need some help,
Officer,

26:26.351 --> 26:28.287
whenever you're done
with your chicken.

26:28.287 --> 26:31.490
That's a 911-69344.

26:31.490 --> 26:33.358
Ooh. It's for sale.

26:33.358 --> 26:34.693
[A'Keria] Shuga could
be in trouble.

26:34.693 --> 26:36.995
I think the chicken had more
air time than Shuga did.

26:36.995 --> 26:39.498
[shouting]

26:39.498 --> 26:41.400
I don't get paid enough
for this.

26:45.537 --> 26:47.606
911.
What's your she-mergency?

26:47.606 --> 26:49.274
[chatter]

26:49.274 --> 26:51.810
Uh-huh.
[chatter]

26:51.810 --> 26:54.012
Uh-huh...

26:54.012 --> 26:56.849
Did you say naked or nekkid?

26:56.849 --> 27:01.119
One Madam 12, head over
to the Tuckahoe Trailer Park.

27:01.119 --> 27:04.022
Suspect is naked and dangerous.

27:04.022 --> 27:05.457
I don't know about you,

27:05.457 --> 27:09.561
but I like spending a little
naked time in my own backyard.

27:09.561 --> 27:11.463
I'm naked right now.

27:11.463 --> 27:12.698
Under my uniform.

27:12.698 --> 27:14.566
[siren]

27:20.572 --> 27:22.741
I don't even want to look.

27:22.741 --> 27:24.443
Oh, God.

27:24.443 --> 27:26.378
Good morning, officers.

27:26.378 --> 27:29.715
Ma'am, we've received
a complaint about public nudity.

27:29.715 --> 27:31.750
I am living my life.

27:31.750 --> 27:33.418
There's nothing wrong
with nudity.

27:33.418 --> 27:35.821
I'm not ashamed of my body.
Are you ashamed of my body?

27:35.821 --> 27:38.090
I definitely am ashamed.

27:38.090 --> 27:39.324
I'm going to need to see
some kind of ID.

27:39.324 --> 27:41.493
Let me check
if I put some down here.

27:41.493 --> 27:43.595
Could you hold this
for a second?

27:43.595 --> 27:44.630
-Okay. Wow.
-Can you see it?

27:44.630 --> 27:46.098
-Is it in there?
-I see something.

27:46.098 --> 27:47.966
-Wow.
-[laughs]

27:47.966 --> 27:49.067
What's your name, ma'am?

27:49.067 --> 27:51.069
Starfire Glamazon.

27:51.069 --> 27:53.005
-Starfire Glamazon.
-Yeah.

27:53.005 --> 27:54.373
You are a robust woman.

27:54.373 --> 27:55.374
I need to see your eyes, ma'am.

27:55.374 --> 27:56.708
-My eyes?
-Yes.

27:56.708 --> 27:58.043
Are you trying
to connect with me?

27:58.043 --> 27:59.845
Do you make a habit
of being naked?

27:59.845 --> 28:01.480
Absolutely.

28:01.480 --> 28:02.814
-And why?
-Why?

28:02.814 --> 28:05.450
Because I'm here
to express my body.

28:05.450 --> 28:06.985
And feel it.

28:06.985 --> 28:08.153
-You see that?
-I did. I saw that.

28:08.153 --> 28:09.621
-That leg can go even higher.
-I saw that.

28:09.621 --> 28:11.023
Are you a dancer?

28:11.023 --> 28:14.226
I teach interpretive dance
down at the community center.

28:14.226 --> 28:17.996
I'm sitting in the trailer
waiting for my cue word.

28:17.996 --> 28:19.131
Is that an A cup?

28:19.131 --> 28:21.166
[sniffs]
Oh, you smell good.

28:21.166 --> 28:22.768
You smell like my dad.

28:22.768 --> 28:24.836
She's not giving me the cue.

28:24.836 --> 28:26.672
Well, girl, this scene

28:26.672 --> 28:28.540
is not Brooke Lynn and Cheyenne,
unfortunately,

28:28.540 --> 28:31.410
so I'm like fuck it,
I have to come out.

28:31.410 --> 28:34.446
Well, it's about high time
you have arrived.

28:34.446 --> 28:36.014
[Jackson]
So what's the problem?

28:36.014 --> 28:37.149
What's the problem?

28:37.149 --> 28:39.251
This lady is in my yard

28:39.251 --> 28:40.786
naked as a jaybird
for the world to see.

28:40.786 --> 28:42.888
[Feimster]
Oh, wait, this is your yard?

28:42.888 --> 28:44.189
This is my green turf.

28:44.189 --> 28:45.757
Oh, I thought that
this was your residence.

28:45.757 --> 28:47.125
I live right next door.

28:47.125 --> 28:48.627
This is Darlene's yard.

28:48.627 --> 28:49.828
Okay, so what is
y'all's relationship?

28:49.828 --> 28:51.296
We've been neighbors
for two years now.

28:51.296 --> 28:53.799
Too very long years.
Ma'am, please don't touch me.

28:53.799 --> 28:55.534
She's a very lonely woman.

28:55.534 --> 28:57.002
My husband just happens
to travel for business.

28:57.002 --> 28:58.604
Why are so repressed?

28:58.604 --> 29:00.772
I'm not so repressed.
Ma'am?

29:00.772 --> 29:02.407
I want to know
if that is alcohol.

29:02.407 --> 29:05.043
Oh, I don't drink.
I'm a level four vegan.

29:05.043 --> 29:06.812
What is a level four vegan?

29:06.812 --> 29:09.314
I eat nothing
that casts a shadow,

29:09.314 --> 29:11.950
and I only eat things raw.

29:11.950 --> 29:15.020
But, ma'am, you called us,
so what seems to be the problem?

29:15.020 --> 29:16.688
Well, we can start
with her baby feeders

29:16.688 --> 29:18.523
being out in the middle
of God's green earth.

29:18.523 --> 29:20.225
Look at them.
Touch them.

29:20.225 --> 29:21.293
Touch them.

29:21.293 --> 29:23.228
How does that make you feel?

29:23.228 --> 29:24.363
Confused.

29:24.363 --> 29:25.998
I don't know
how I got in on this.

29:25.998 --> 29:28.800
Please, please, remove my hands
from your breasts, ma'am.

29:28.800 --> 29:30.969
-You need--
-This is the problem, officer.

29:30.969 --> 29:33.905
[Shuga] So Nina's hilarious.
No surprise.

29:33.905 --> 29:36.975
But the gagger for
this whole thing is Brooke Lynn.

29:36.975 --> 29:38.276
Oh, you feel so good.

29:38.276 --> 29:40.879
She's so crazy.
She's actually really funny.

29:40.879 --> 29:42.314
It's time
for me to do some yoga.

29:42.314 --> 29:43.782
Could you just stand there
for a second?

29:43.782 --> 29:45.050
I called you
to resolve the situation.

29:45.050 --> 29:46.184
What kind of help are you--

29:46.184 --> 29:47.352
I need to relax.

29:47.352 --> 29:50.188
My energy
is very tense right now.

29:50.188 --> 29:51.623
Your what?

29:51.623 --> 29:53.291
We cannot have this here
in this--

29:53.291 --> 29:55.627
This is a body
and it is beautiful.

29:55.627 --> 29:58.897
Holy Moses, that is
a parting of the Red Sea.

29:58.897 --> 30:01.933
This is my lady garden,
and I am not ashamed.

30:01.933 --> 30:03.502
I call her Paula,
and I keep her hidden.

30:03.502 --> 30:04.836
[Brooke Lynn]
Someone's ashamed though.

30:04.836 --> 30:06.338
Give me your your hands.
You need to let it--

30:06.338 --> 30:08.707
Oh, my Lord.

30:08.707 --> 30:11.076
I feel like
we've got it under control.

30:11.076 --> 30:12.377
I think
they're about to make love.

30:12.377 --> 30:14.146
Jethro will be very upset.

30:15.147 --> 30:17.382
-Ma'am, get off the car.
-Ma'am.

30:17.382 --> 30:19.317
You're about to meet
my government property.

30:19.317 --> 30:20.552
Officer Feimster, I'm going
to need some help here.

30:20.552 --> 30:22.254
-Oh, okay.
-Right here.

30:22.254 --> 30:24.556
Dive in.
Yeah, oh, yeah.

30:24.556 --> 30:25.624
-Oh, yeah.
-Oh, God.

30:25.624 --> 30:28.360
[all laugh]
Don't you feel so free?

30:34.366 --> 30:36.334
[RuPaul] Hello.
What's your she-mergency?

30:36.334 --> 30:38.403
Yes, ma'am,
I do speak cat fluently.

30:38.403 --> 30:39.404
[caller] Meow, meow.

30:39.404 --> 30:41.640
Rawr. Rawr, rawr.

30:41.640 --> 30:43.108
-Meow.
-Rawr.

30:43.108 --> 30:45.143
Meow.

30:45.143 --> 30:46.945
[hiss]

30:46.945 --> 30:48.747
[RuPaul] One Madam 12 1/2,

30:48.747 --> 30:51.717
cat fight
in front of Kitty Liquors.

30:51.717 --> 30:54.953
Cats. I'm deathly allergic
to cats.

30:56.154 --> 30:57.255
[siren]

30:57.255 --> 30:59.991
[screaming and meowing]

31:06.598 --> 31:08.266
Kitties, come on.

31:08.266 --> 31:09.267
Break it up, please.
Break it up.

31:09.267 --> 31:10.268
Oh, officer.

31:10.268 --> 31:13.839
-Okay, okay.
-Officer. Oh!

31:13.839 --> 31:17.476
Miss Plastique went to the cop
and started cupping him,

31:17.476 --> 31:19.311
and I told her only do that
when you go blank.

31:19.311 --> 31:21.513
So she must have went blank
the first second.

31:23.281 --> 31:24.282
Explain to me
what's happening here.

31:24.282 --> 31:25.917
-What's happening?
-Officer--

31:25.917 --> 31:27.285
Why you only talking to her?

31:27.285 --> 31:28.954
You judging me
'cause I'm from the street?

31:28.954 --> 31:30.355
Hey, quiet down.
Quiet down.

31:30.355 --> 31:32.591
What's up?
Whip your taser out, mama.

31:32.591 --> 31:34.159
-Oh, no.
-Bitch, don't.

31:34.159 --> 31:35.227
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

31:35.227 --> 31:37.362
-[screams]
-One kitty at a time here.

31:37.362 --> 31:38.630
Your side of the story. Go.

31:38.630 --> 31:40.532
I came to get my milk--

31:40.532 --> 31:42.567
-Officer, I was on--
-And she slept with my man.

31:44.002 --> 31:45.537
You got milk
'cause she slept--

31:45.537 --> 31:46.872
Yeah, she slept with my man.

31:46.872 --> 31:48.106
I came to get
the milk from her.

31:48.106 --> 31:49.374
What's your side
of the story, ma'am?

31:49.374 --> 31:50.709
I was on my way to the Schubert
Theater to audition.

31:50.709 --> 31:52.911
She's lying, she's lying.

31:52.911 --> 31:54.179
All right, ma'am,
you had your side.

31:54.179 --> 31:56.314
I was gonna be Grizabella

31:56.314 --> 31:58.483
in the local production of Cats.

31:58.483 --> 32:00.051
And this witch right here--

32:00.051 --> 32:02.154
-Cats. Where's that at?
-This witch right here.

32:02.154 --> 32:03.421
She threw the milk at me.

32:03.421 --> 32:05.056
-You do Broadway?
-She snatched my milk from me.

32:05.056 --> 32:06.825
-Okay.
-I'm so confused.

32:06.825 --> 32:09.227
I think they're fighting
over milk?

32:09.227 --> 32:10.729
I don't know.

32:10.729 --> 32:12.230
Why you slept with my man, ho?

32:12.230 --> 32:15.934
[scream meowing]

32:17.769 --> 32:19.704
What the fuck is happening?
[scoffs]

32:19.704 --> 32:22.440
[screaming]

32:24.176 --> 32:27.712
You know,
the rawrs were cohesive.

32:27.712 --> 32:28.847
Ladies, we're going to do
a sobriety test.

32:28.847 --> 32:30.182
Rawr!

32:30.182 --> 32:32.250
Broadway kitty, I want
two counts of eight. Ready?

32:32.250 --> 32:33.718
Broadway kitty? Yeah, right.

32:33.718 --> 32:35.187
Five, six, seven, eight.

32:35.187 --> 32:36.721
Pas de bourrée, pas de bourrée,

32:36.721 --> 32:39.991
uh, uh, uh,
and time step and go.

32:39.991 --> 32:41.493
Five, six, seven, eight.

32:41.493 --> 32:43.261
Pas de bourrée, pas de bourrée,

32:43.261 --> 32:44.729
gah, gah, gah, gah,
gah, gah, gah.

32:44.729 --> 32:45.964
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

32:45.964 --> 32:48.333
Time step.
All right.

32:48.333 --> 32:51.036
That ain't Broadway.
See, the bitch is lying.

32:51.036 --> 32:53.038
That cat got alopecia.
She's sick.

32:53.038 --> 32:54.306
She need to be put down.

32:54.306 --> 32:57.209
She wishes she could dance
as much as me, bitch.

32:57.209 --> 32:58.443
Oh, oh, oh!

32:58.443 --> 33:00.679
Knock it off, knock it off.

33:00.679 --> 33:01.980
I could go get a sugar daddy.

33:01.980 --> 33:03.048
-Oh, no.
-Ma'am, don't do it.

33:03.048 --> 33:04.049
That's--that's--

33:04.049 --> 33:05.317
Eew.

33:05.317 --> 33:07.118
I swear to God
this is like herding cats.

33:07.118 --> 33:08.320
-All right.
-Oh!

33:08.320 --> 33:09.788
Yeah, arrest her.
Thank you.

33:09.788 --> 33:10.922
-Don't you know that?
-Yeah.

33:10.922 --> 33:12.691
Don't you know that, Cheyenne?

33:12.691 --> 33:14.793
Yeah, look, she's faking.
Now she's got an Asian accent.

33:14.793 --> 33:15.827
Girl.

33:15.827 --> 33:19.464
When all else fails, go Asian.

33:19.464 --> 33:20.632
-Follow this.
-Yeah.

33:20.632 --> 33:22.334
What is this?

33:22.334 --> 33:25.770
I know how
to handle my pussies.

33:25.770 --> 33:27.172
[Jackson]
Cats out of the bag.

33:27.172 --> 33:28.907
Cats out of the bag.

33:28.907 --> 33:30.408
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

33:30.408 --> 33:32.611
That bitch is getting arrested.

33:32.611 --> 33:34.946
Let's just call animal services
and get out of here.

33:40.385 --> 33:41.987
[RuPaul]
What's your she-mergency?

33:41.987 --> 33:43.488
[chatter]

33:43.488 --> 33:45.790
Uh-huh.
If you don't mind me asking,

33:45.790 --> 33:47.225
how are the tips over there?

33:47.225 --> 33:48.560
[chatter]

33:48.560 --> 33:50.595
Ooh, damn, girl.

33:50.595 --> 33:53.331
I need to consider me
a new line of work.

33:53.331 --> 33:57.602
All officers, reports
of two twerking girls fighting

33:57.602 --> 33:59.304
near the Big Freedia Parkway.

33:59.304 --> 34:01.473
Wait, two working girls?

34:01.473 --> 34:03.642
No, two twerking girls.

34:03.642 --> 34:05.377
They're performers.

34:05.377 --> 34:07.412
They are indeed, my friend.

34:07.412 --> 34:09.981
They are indeed.

34:09.981 --> 34:11.650
[siren]

34:11.650 --> 34:13.051
Now, young bitch,
I done told you.

34:13.051 --> 34:15.453
Next time I see you I was
gonna slap you one good time.

34:15.453 --> 34:17.155
Slap me for what, bitch?
I don't even--

34:17.155 --> 34:18.423
Uh!

34:18.423 --> 34:19.891
I done told you.

34:19.891 --> 34:21.326
Now you better--oh!

34:21.326 --> 34:23.561
Oh, now I'm old, bitch,
but I can get with you.

34:23.561 --> 34:25.163
Is that all you got?

34:25.163 --> 34:26.831
Ladies, we're gonna
back it up, ladies.

34:26.831 --> 34:27.832
-Ladies, wait, wait, wait.
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

34:27.832 --> 34:29.034
Ladies, back it up now.

34:29.034 --> 34:30.402
Listen, Officer,
I don't mean to be rude to you,

34:30.402 --> 34:31.603
but this is my corner.

34:31.603 --> 34:33.371
It's been my corner
for over 35 years.

34:33.371 --> 34:36.308
I've twerked my ass
from that end to that end.

34:36.308 --> 34:38.009
I've told this
box built bitch

34:38.009 --> 34:39.244
not to come back over here
no more.

34:39.244 --> 34:40.946
I just want her to leave,
Officer.

34:40.946 --> 34:42.080
Do you guys know each other?

34:42.080 --> 34:44.616
I never met her
in my whole booty-shaking life.

34:44.616 --> 34:47.686
I just got back
from the Twerkus Girls,

34:47.686 --> 34:49.988
from Barnum
and Booty-Shakum.

34:49.988 --> 34:52.123
I dropped it low
around the world.

34:52.123 --> 34:53.959
These young ho's
don't know none of the history

34:53.959 --> 34:56.061
on what it is
to be a street twerker.

34:56.061 --> 34:57.295
I got a YouTube channel
with lots of followers.

34:57.295 --> 34:58.763
All right, ladies.

34:58.763 --> 35:00.098
There's only way to settle this.

35:00.098 --> 35:01.900
We're gonna have to see you
in action here.

35:01.900 --> 35:03.735
I'm gonna have to get something
to prop myself up,

35:03.735 --> 35:07.439
but I can still get down
with the git down.

35:07.439 --> 35:09.341
Oh, oh, my back.
Hold on.

35:09.341 --> 35:10.775
[chuckles]

35:10.775 --> 35:12.544
I paid good money for it.
You're gonna slap it today.

35:12.544 --> 35:15.580
-Ma'am, ma'am.
-You gonna slap it today.

35:15.580 --> 35:17.082
-Ma'am.
-Slap it today.

35:17.082 --> 35:18.083
[laughs]

35:18.083 --> 35:19.651
Let me ask you something.

35:19.651 --> 35:21.152
Have you ever thought
about retiring?

35:21.152 --> 35:22.153
I didn't want to sit
on this corner

35:22.153 --> 35:23.288
and twerk my whole life.

35:23.288 --> 35:24.789
I threw my back out
seven times.

35:24.789 --> 35:26.057
I get it.

35:26.057 --> 35:28.393
But I have to keep these
fillings in my face correct.

35:28.393 --> 35:30.328
I tried to join a Twerkus.

35:30.328 --> 35:32.630
Since 1987,
these are how many times

35:32.630 --> 35:34.232
I've filled out applications.

35:34.232 --> 35:35.533
They never accepted me.

35:35.533 --> 35:37.836
I met some man
named Marky Mark.

35:37.836 --> 35:39.037
He gave me a position.

35:39.037 --> 35:41.039
What? Are you kidding me?

35:41.039 --> 35:42.640
What, do I look like
I kid you, baby?

35:42.640 --> 35:43.775
Wait, do you have--

35:43.775 --> 35:44.843
Do you know Marky Mark
or something?

35:44.843 --> 35:45.877
You sleeping with him, too?

35:45.877 --> 35:48.413
My dad, Mr. Wahlberg,

35:48.413 --> 35:50.348
told me that he used to be
a rapper and his--

35:50.348 --> 35:51.383
Marky Mark.

35:51.383 --> 35:53.918
[Yvie] And his name is Mark.

35:53.918 --> 35:56.187
Oh!

35:56.187 --> 35:58.089
-[cries]
-Oh!

35:58.089 --> 35:59.124
Wow.

35:59.124 --> 36:01.192
Oh!

36:01.192 --> 36:02.694
[cries]

36:02.694 --> 36:04.262
[A'Keria]
Oh, it's my baby.

36:04.262 --> 36:05.663
Can we twerk this out, mama?

36:05.663 --> 36:07.265
Oh, it's my baby.

36:07.265 --> 36:09.868
-Can we twerk this out, mama?
-It's my baby.

36:09.868 --> 36:11.669
Officer, this is my child.

36:11.669 --> 36:12.904
It's your mom.

36:12.904 --> 36:13.972
I gave her up years ago.

36:13.972 --> 36:16.241
[Jackson]
This is beautiful,

36:16.241 --> 36:17.575
but you're both under arrest,
unfortunately,

36:17.575 --> 36:20.178
so I need you
to gather up your things.

36:20.178 --> 36:21.679
You want me to click back
too fast, I got to go.

36:21.679 --> 36:23.548
-It's illegal.
-Ma'am, ma'am, ma'am.

36:23.548 --> 36:24.816
Twerking is a blessing.

36:24.816 --> 36:27.852
Twerking is a blessing, baby.

36:27.852 --> 36:30.155
Mama, when we
get into the block,

36:30.155 --> 36:32.223
we're gonna have to start
a twerk team.

36:32.223 --> 36:33.425
No, ma'am.

36:33.425 --> 36:35.126
Twerk team.

36:35.126 --> 36:36.127
I'm trying to get it.

36:36.127 --> 36:37.762
Damn, my back went out again.

36:37.762 --> 36:40.165
Goddamnit, where's my cane.

36:40.165 --> 36:42.534
Can I just get a snack?
My sugar low.

36:42.534 --> 36:44.602
Oh!

36:44.602 --> 36:46.337
Okay, okay, yeah,
we're gonna need some backup.

36:46.337 --> 36:47.505
[A'Keria] No way!
You got to catch me.

36:47.505 --> 36:49.908
We have a twerker on the loose.

36:49.908 --> 36:51.376
She doesn't need that cane.

36:51.376 --> 36:53.244
Yo. Oh, damn, they coming.

36:53.244 --> 36:54.446
I am having a blast.

36:54.446 --> 36:55.880
As a pageant girl,

36:55.880 --> 36:57.415
I have to be poised
and so graceful,

36:57.415 --> 37:00.318
and, girl, I can't even fart,

37:00.318 --> 37:02.721
But obviously today
something has come over me,

37:02.721 --> 37:04.389
and I allowed myself to be free

37:04.389 --> 37:06.357
with a splash of foolishness.

37:06.357 --> 37:08.093
Hey, sit down.

37:08.093 --> 37:09.994
You cannot twerk and drive.

37:09.994 --> 37:11.663
[A'Keria] Twerk it!

37:19.137 --> 37:20.939
-Whoo-hoo.
-Give it to me, baby.

37:20.939 --> 37:23.007
-Yes.
-No swimsuit this time.

37:23.007 --> 37:25.610
And...pose.

37:25.610 --> 37:27.946
[Yvie] Today is runway day,

37:27.946 --> 37:31.349
and the runway theme
is Facekini.

37:31.349 --> 37:33.818
It's based off
of RuPaul's iconic look.

37:33.818 --> 37:36.721
You just have to serve
as much face as you can

37:36.721 --> 37:38.890
with only showing
your eyes and lips.

37:38.890 --> 37:40.158
[laughs]

37:40.158 --> 37:41.659
Whew.

37:41.659 --> 37:42.761
[Brooke Lynn] After yesterday,
there's a lot of nervous energy,

37:42.761 --> 37:44.162
because we don't know

37:44.162 --> 37:46.197
if we're being judged
as groups or as individuals.

37:46.197 --> 37:48.766
So I don't think anybody
really truly feels safe,

37:48.766 --> 37:50.735
except for probably Silky,

37:50.735 --> 37:53.138
'cause she always
thinks she's safe.

37:54.472 --> 37:56.374
Neen, how you feeling?

37:56.374 --> 37:59.077
[Nina] I think this is gonna
be a tough elimination week.

37:59.077 --> 38:00.545
There's four groups,

38:00.545 --> 38:03.748
which means the percentage
is one out of four

38:03.748 --> 38:05.116
that's going to be
in the bottom.

38:05.116 --> 38:09.687
[Brooke Lynn] Of course,
Nina's overanalyzing everything,

38:09.687 --> 38:11.022
as she does.

38:11.022 --> 38:12.991
I love her,
but everything is like,

38:12.991 --> 38:15.160
I think we're, I think we're,
I think we're gonna be okay.

38:15.160 --> 38:16.261
Do you think
we're gonna be okay?

38:16.261 --> 38:19.898
I hope that we did our job,
you know.

38:19.898 --> 38:21.766
I know I gave it my all

38:21.766 --> 38:23.434
and I had a lot of fun

38:23.434 --> 38:26.905
and I feel like I really let go
and like got into it.

38:26.905 --> 38:28.339
Yeah.

38:28.339 --> 38:30.842
An actor Brooke Lynn is not.

38:30.842 --> 38:33.211
But I switched roles with her

38:33.211 --> 38:34.712
so she would feel
more comfortable.

38:34.712 --> 38:37.815
In the scene,
I didn't get my cue line,

38:37.815 --> 38:39.551
and it kind of threw me off
my game.

38:39.551 --> 38:42.720
It feels like I was
tossed to the wayside

38:42.720 --> 38:44.122
the second there was a glimmer
of success in the window.

38:44.122 --> 38:47.392
I might get sued
for inappropriate touching.

38:47.392 --> 38:51.229
[Nina] I'm not sure what's
going on with Brooke Lynn.

38:51.229 --> 38:53.598
It sounds like I'm being bitter.
I'm not.

38:53.598 --> 38:55.166
I'm really want to be clear.

38:55.166 --> 38:56.367
I'm not trying
to take away from her,

38:56.367 --> 38:58.670
but I'm hoping
it's not intentional.

38:58.670 --> 38:59.938
Oh, my God.

39:10.014 --> 39:11.482
[Shuga] Go on, Silky.

39:11.482 --> 39:12.784
So we're all getting ready.

39:12.784 --> 39:14.752
Some of us are painting
a full face,

39:14.752 --> 39:16.521
some of us
just a little eye and lip.

39:16.521 --> 39:17.755
And I'm noticing Silky,

39:17.755 --> 39:19.524
she ain't even started
to paint her face.

39:19.524 --> 39:21.025
Silky.

39:21.025 --> 39:23.094
-[Vanjie] Silky.
-[Silky] What?

39:23.094 --> 39:24.796
Why are you not
putting on makeup?

39:24.796 --> 39:27.065
I don't need to do nothing
but a lip today.

39:27.065 --> 39:28.199
Oh, okay.

39:29.467 --> 39:30.768
[Shuga] You at least
gotta put something on.

39:30.768 --> 39:32.203
If you have to lip sync, girl,

39:32.203 --> 39:34.138
you can't be hiding behind
the mask, Valentina.

39:34.138 --> 39:36.841
[Silky] I'm doing
a 10-minute mug today.

39:36.841 --> 39:38.142
Did you finish your costume?

39:38.142 --> 39:39.410
Let me do that.

39:39.410 --> 39:41.412
[Yvie laughs]

39:41.412 --> 39:43.715
Bitch,
it's a Facekini challenge.

39:43.715 --> 39:45.783
My whole face is covered up.

39:45.783 --> 39:48.219
And besides, no shade.

39:48.219 --> 39:50.121
I don't think I'm
lip syncing for my life tonight

39:50.121 --> 39:51.656
because of my performance.

39:53.725 --> 39:55.493
[Yvie] Girl, we all look
like we're up in here

39:55.493 --> 39:56.728

41:30.621 --> 41:34.659
[Silky] I am wearing a sleek

with a beautiful
black facekini.

41:36.828 --> 41:38.996
This look is simple
and elegant,

41:38.996 --> 41:41.332
just to show off
this beautiful mask

and also there's a nod
to A Clockwork Orange,

42:43.895 --> 42:45.797
and maybe a little bit
of Mr. Peanut.

42:45.797 --> 42:47.498
[laughs] My moustache.

42:47.498 --> 42:51.035
I love, love, love my facekini.

42:51.035 --> 42:53.237
[all laugh]

42:53.237 --> 42:54.772
[RuPaul] This look
really suits her.

42:54.772 --> 42:56.274
[all laugh]

42:56.274 --> 42:58.009
[RuPaul] Vanjie.

42:58.009 --> 43:00.645
Oh, she's drop-dead
full gorgeous.

43:00.645 --> 43:03.047
[Vanjie]
I'm robbing the sex store,

43:03.047 --> 43:04.582
and I'm hitting the corner.

43:04.582 --> 43:06.083
I'm looking good,

43:06.083 --> 43:09.821
and I'm feeling snakeskin
dominatrix sex toy doll.

43:09.821 --> 43:11.456
And I'm feeling my fantasy.

43:11.456 --> 43:13.324
[Natasha] Rapunzel,
throw down your hair.

43:13.324 --> 43:15.326
[all laugh]

43:15.326 --> 43:17.328
[RuPaul] Plastique Tiara.

43:17.328 --> 43:20.131
[Cheyenne] Why's it gotta
be black...licorice?

43:20.131 --> 43:21.833
[all laugh]

43:21.833 --> 43:24.035
[Plastique] This look
is definitely a lot more edgy

43:24.035 --> 43:26.103
than what I usually serve
on the runway.

43:26.103 --> 43:27.638
More sex, more fetish.

43:27.638 --> 43:31.242
I'm living my fullest
American Horror Story fantasy.

43:31.242 --> 43:33.744
[Fortune]
Her mask looks like her face.

43:33.744 --> 43:35.146
[RuPaul] It's more
of a face thong.

43:35.146 --> 43:36.347
[Natasha] They only wear this

43:36.347 --> 43:38.583
on the hottest beaches
in Brazil.

43:38.583 --> 43:40.351
[all laugh]

43:40.351 --> 43:42.687
[RuPaul] A'Keria C. Davenport.

43:42.687 --> 43:44.655
[Natasha] Send me
the name of your surgeon.

43:44.655 --> 43:46.057
[all laugh]

43:46.057 --> 43:47.291
[A'Keria]
I'm fresh off the table, baby.

43:47.291 --> 43:50.027
Nipped, tucked,
pumped, and plumped.

43:50.027 --> 43:52.897
I got these lips bigger,
these cheekbones.

43:52.897 --> 43:55.132
Feel these heels, this ass.

43:55.132 --> 43:58.136
Ain't no waistline,
all booty and breasts.

43:58.136 --> 44:00.638
And I even my knees tucked in.

44:00.638 --> 44:02.039
[Natasha]
Eh, if you're going in,

44:02.039 --> 44:03.441
you may as well
get it all done.

44:03.441 --> 44:04.842
[RuPaul]
Somebody call her a lift.

44:04.842 --> 44:06.878
[all laugh]

44:06.878 --> 44:08.079
Yvie Oddly.

44:08.079 --> 44:11.883
This is not
the Nickelodeon channel.

44:11.883 --> 44:13.618
[Yvie]
Tonight I'm a slime monster

44:13.618 --> 44:15.319
from the sexy Black Lagoon.

44:15.319 --> 44:18.589
It's definitely leaning
towards like a Club Kid feel.

44:18.589 --> 44:20.958
I have these sex toy lips

44:20.958 --> 44:23.060
that you're supposed
to stick in your mouth

44:23.060 --> 44:25.463
to keep you from giving
too much teeth.

44:25.463 --> 44:29.167
Instead
I show nothing but teeth

44:29.167 --> 44:33.471
because I love
a good old-fashioned grin.

44:33.471 --> 44:35.740
[RuPaul] I'm pretty sure
she's a bottom feeder.

44:35.740 --> 44:37.275
[all laugh]

44:37.275 --> 44:38.509
[RuPaul] Welcome, ladies.

44:38.509 --> 44:40.645
This week
you performed as pairs,

44:40.645 --> 44:44.081
but tonight
you'll be judged individually.

44:45.750 --> 44:49.086
When I call your name,
please step forward.

44:50.154 --> 44:52.823
Yvie Oddly.

44:52.823 --> 44:54.825
Nina West.

44:54.825 --> 44:57.762
Ladies, you are safe.

44:59.063 --> 45:00.364
Thank you.

45:00.364 --> 45:01.799
You may leave the stage.

45:06.137 --> 45:10.241
Ladies, now it's time
to face the nation,

45:10.241 --> 45:13.144
starting with the Reverend

45:13.144 --> 45:16.113
Dr. Silky Nutmeg Ganache.

45:16.113 --> 45:18.549
In the challenge,
you were really extraordinary.

45:18.549 --> 45:22.186
You almost hit this Mike Leigh
level of rawness.

45:22.186 --> 45:24.789
You were just like
so immediately believable

45:24.789 --> 45:27.525
as somebody who was
going to be arrested.

45:27.525 --> 45:29.260
[Fortune] You're so funny.

45:29.260 --> 45:31.696
With comedy, you're
just somebody that has it,

45:31.696 --> 45:32.964
and people want to watch you.

45:32.964 --> 45:35.433
As far as being a scene partner,

45:35.433 --> 45:37.935
there were times
that I couldn't hear Shuga

45:37.935 --> 45:41.739
or times that I wanted the focus
to be on a her for a minute,

45:41.739 --> 45:43.341
and then we'll come back to you.

45:43.341 --> 45:46.177
But there wasn't much
give and take there.

45:46.177 --> 45:50.147
Tonight on the runway
I do think that the idea is fun.

45:50.147 --> 45:52.183
The roach with the--
you're a roach, correct?

45:52.183 --> 45:53.351
A fly.

45:53.351 --> 45:55.453
A fly with no wings is a roach.

45:55.453 --> 45:57.521
I also thought maybe roach, too.

45:57.521 --> 46:00.691
Are you wearing any paint
under that facekini?

46:00.691 --> 46:02.693
A little bit.

46:02.693 --> 46:03.928
What, just a lip?

46:03.928 --> 46:05.229
Like lip, yeah,

46:05.229 --> 46:06.931
because my eyes wasn't seen
when I put it on.

46:06.931 --> 46:09.400
Well, I feel like
you could have,

46:09.400 --> 46:10.635
because it's a drag show,

46:10.635 --> 46:12.670
so we want to see
part of what you are under,

46:12.670 --> 46:15.306
and I feel like
that's a cop out.

46:15.306 --> 46:17.074
Up next, Shuga Cain.

46:17.074 --> 46:18.843
I love what you're wearing
on the runway.

46:18.843 --> 46:20.077
I think it's just great.

46:20.077 --> 46:22.647
It's like
a Mary Poppins acid trip.

46:22.647 --> 46:24.115
[laughs]

46:24.115 --> 46:25.816
I see your beautiful kind of
rose colored paint through it,

46:25.816 --> 46:27.818
with the sparkles on your eyes.

46:27.818 --> 46:29.320
This is very pretty
and very finished.

46:29.320 --> 46:30.855
Thank you.

46:30.855 --> 46:32.523
But...

46:32.523 --> 46:33.991
That was tough, that one.

46:33.991 --> 46:37.461
You had to do that scene
with this crazy pad saleswoman.

46:37.461 --> 46:39.997
And I saw
you trying to be present,

46:39.997 --> 46:41.299
but I think what was missing

46:41.299 --> 46:43.267
is I felt like Shuga
was being Shuga,

46:43.267 --> 46:47.672
and I wanted you to be more
of this church woman.

46:47.672 --> 46:50.241
Building that character
in advance

46:50.241 --> 46:52.109
would have helped get
a little bit more leg room.

46:53.377 --> 46:54.745
Up next, Brooke Lynn Hytes.

46:54.745 --> 46:55.846
Hello.

46:55.846 --> 46:58.649
You were really great
in this improv.

46:58.649 --> 47:02.520
And when you said level four
vegan, was a really great line.

47:02.520 --> 47:04.488
And I've never seen a tuck
that close.

47:04.488 --> 47:06.323
Are you sure?

47:06.323 --> 47:09.193
[all laugh]

47:09.193 --> 47:10.561
You were able to use your body,

47:10.561 --> 47:12.763
and I think for once,
you let go.

47:12.763 --> 47:13.931
I sure did. [laughs]

47:13.931 --> 47:15.132
So all those things

47:15.132 --> 47:17.301
you say
you can't do in the past,

47:17.301 --> 47:19.270
you just showed us
that you could.

47:19.270 --> 47:21.005
-Thank you.
-Nina was awesome, too.

47:21.005 --> 47:22.406
Yeah, she was.

47:22.406 --> 47:24.175
I couldn't have done it
without her.

47:24.175 --> 47:25.476
And your look is amazing.

47:25.476 --> 47:27.778
You're like a glittery
zebra horse.

47:27.778 --> 47:30.314
Your face paint
is fully tied in with it.

47:30.314 --> 47:31.749
We can see that.

47:31.749 --> 47:33.818
We can see your paint.
We can see the details.

47:33.818 --> 47:36.987
That's what I
in particular look for.

47:36.987 --> 47:41.225
[RuPaul] Up next,
Vanessa Vanjie Mateo.

47:41.225 --> 47:43.427
Very nice to see
something else on Vanjie.

47:43.427 --> 47:46.497
I'm getting kind
of Mexican wrestler.

47:46.497 --> 47:48.299
Just as long as you don't say
the "S" word...

47:48.299 --> 47:49.700
[whispers]
Silhouette.

47:49.700 --> 47:50.768
But I'm going to have
to say silhouette.

47:50.768 --> 47:52.303
Oh, shit.

47:52.303 --> 47:56.073
Because you're wearing a pair
of pants that have a stirrup.

47:56.073 --> 47:57.374
-Who that is?
-Okay, that's the little strap

47:57.374 --> 47:58.809
that goes under your foot.

47:58.809 --> 48:01.011
-Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
-You got one of those, right?

48:01.011 --> 48:02.146
Yeah.

48:02.146 --> 48:03.380
Because they make your leg
go tubular.

48:03.380 --> 48:04.982
So instead of having shape
in your leg,

48:04.982 --> 48:06.417
it looks like two tubes,

48:06.417 --> 48:08.219
like the blow up people
outside of a car dealership.

48:08.219 --> 48:10.254
Right. That.

48:10.254 --> 48:12.256
But also part of the silhouette

48:12.256 --> 48:13.624
could have been
a little bit of a boob.

48:13.624 --> 48:15.993
You're padding in your hips,
so to balance it out,

48:15.993 --> 48:20.197
in something like that
silhouette, it will help.

48:20.197 --> 48:22.733
It didn't occur to me
there were no boobs involved.

48:22.733 --> 48:24.201
You're like a very sexy robot.

48:24.201 --> 48:27.071
Very sexy sort of
a robot nightclub

48:27.071 --> 48:28.606
that I would love to go to.

48:28.606 --> 48:32.643
And the collar, braid,
latex waving in the wind,

48:32.643 --> 48:34.111
I think you look great.

48:34.111 --> 48:37.515
[Cheyenne] In the improv,
you started like,

48:37.515 --> 48:40.050
so pissed and so on 10,

48:40.050 --> 48:42.153
there was nowhere to go.

48:42.153 --> 48:43.487
Also it was really hard to hear.

48:43.487 --> 48:45.089
[screaming]

48:45.089 --> 48:46.924
Cops wise, you nailed it.

48:46.924 --> 48:49.126
But it's also an acting scene,

48:49.126 --> 48:51.362
and there was no way
for anyone to get in there.

48:51.362 --> 48:53.531
With both of you,
it was a bit of a free-for-all.

48:54.665 --> 48:58.202
Up next, Plastique Tiara.

48:58.202 --> 49:01.338
Tonight on the runway,
you always look so pretty.

49:01.338 --> 49:03.140
But I can't tell you
how much I wish

49:03.140 --> 49:05.743
it was an actual latex facekini.

49:05.743 --> 49:07.878
Because it's not
the full facekini

49:07.878 --> 49:11.248
that I'm getting all the way
around, which was the challenge.

49:11.248 --> 49:14.652
In the improv, when I gave you
the sobriety test,

49:14.652 --> 49:17.221
and I gave you that silly count
and you actually did it,

49:17.221 --> 49:19.857
but then added like
a cooter slam, it was awesome.

49:19.857 --> 49:22.193
-Can you say that?
-I hope so.

49:22.193 --> 49:24.461
I want to say it.
Cooter slam.

49:24.461 --> 49:26.096
[Cheyenne]
That is what improv is,

49:26.096 --> 49:27.264
and I wish that
there was more of that.

49:27.264 --> 49:28.766
[Michelle]
And I found it interesting

49:28.766 --> 49:31.001
that when you had
nowhere left to go,

49:31.001 --> 49:33.771
you ended up
back in the Asian accent.

49:33.771 --> 49:35.272
Don't you know that?

49:35.272 --> 49:38.042
I didn't even know
I was doing it. Honestly.

49:38.042 --> 49:39.410
That's like my real voice.

49:39.410 --> 49:41.045
Well, no,
this is your real voice.

49:41.045 --> 49:43.380
No, like, I didn't even notice
I was doing it.

49:44.682 --> 49:46.750
Well, it happened again,

49:46.750 --> 49:47.818
and I don't want you
to fall on a crutch,

49:47.818 --> 49:48.819
because I feel like
you're more

49:48.819 --> 49:51.889
than just being
an Asian stereotype.

49:51.889 --> 49:54.091
Asian pride
and Asian stereotypes

49:54.091 --> 49:55.526
are two different things, right?

49:55.526 --> 49:58.562
We want you to stay
in Asian pride.

49:58.562 --> 50:02.132
Up next,
A'Keria C. Davenport.

50:02.132 --> 50:05.035
Well, A'Keria, you were
not afraid to get ugly.

50:05.035 --> 50:09.874
You wore that Hillary Clinton
wig, and you had me laughing.

50:09.874 --> 50:11.475
[Cheyenne]
Yeah, working with you

50:11.475 --> 50:13.677
was one of the highlights
for me yesterday.

50:13.677 --> 50:16.013
You really seemed to know
who this person was.

50:16.013 --> 50:19.216
There's just a lot of confidence
and a lot of calm about you.

50:19.216 --> 50:21.318
Fortune gave you
a couple of great funny things,

50:21.318 --> 50:23.187
and you took it,
listened, and ran with it,

50:23.187 --> 50:25.222
and that
is what is the whole deal.

50:25.222 --> 50:28.192
And you always had
new bits happening.

50:28.192 --> 50:30.261
You were even twerking
when he tried to cuff you.

50:30.261 --> 50:32.529
I think you were even
crying and twerking.

50:32.529 --> 50:33.697
[crying]

50:33.697 --> 50:35.032
[all laugh]

50:35.032 --> 50:38.102
And this unikini is fantastic,
and I know a few times

50:38.102 --> 50:40.337
we've done the plastic surgery
story a lot on this runway,

50:40.337 --> 50:42.840
but this
is a new interpretation.

50:42.840 --> 50:45.276
It's almost marked off
like cows are for beef.

50:45.276 --> 50:46.677
Mmm.

50:46.677 --> 50:48.545
-Am I making you hungry?
-Yeah.

50:48.545 --> 50:50.347
Since I've been here,

50:50.347 --> 50:54.718
I was afraid to lose
that poised, elegant A'Keria.

50:54.718 --> 50:58.522
But I finally realized,
you know,

50:58.522 --> 50:59.690
that's the best part of it.

50:59.690 --> 51:00.691
Yeah.

51:00.691 --> 51:02.326
Like actually having fun.

51:02.326 --> 51:04.028
Well, thank you, A'Keria.

51:04.028 --> 51:05.029
Thank you.

51:05.029 --> 51:06.497
[RuPaul] Thank you, ladies.

51:06.497 --> 51:07.698
I think we've heard enough.

51:07.698 --> 51:10.100
While you untuck backstage,

51:10.100 --> 51:12.269
the judges and I
will deliberate.

51:13.470 --> 51:16.240
All right, just between
us squirrel friends,

51:16.240 --> 51:17.408
what do you think?

51:17.408 --> 51:19.944
The Reverend
Dr. Silky Nutmeg Ganache.

51:19.944 --> 51:20.978
I loved Silky.

51:20.978 --> 51:22.913
She was so great in her improv,

51:22.913 --> 51:25.182
really funny,
a really good actress.

51:25.182 --> 51:27.017
[Cheyenne] She was
really committed.

51:27.017 --> 51:30.020
I physically could not
get her into the car.

51:30.020 --> 51:31.355
[all laugh]
I wasn't acting.

51:31.355 --> 51:33.357
I literally could not
get this bitch in the car.

51:33.357 --> 51:35.259
-That's why I just sat on her.
-Yeah, no, I couldn't do it.

51:35.259 --> 51:36.660
[RuPaul] Yeah, she was the one

51:36.660 --> 51:39.563
who most I wanted to see
a sitcom based around her life.

51:39.563 --> 51:40.931
As far as her look,

51:40.931 --> 51:44.969
it was less of a facekini
and more of a ski mask.

51:44.969 --> 51:46.403
I could tell
the minute she walked out

51:46.403 --> 51:47.705
that there's no paint
under there.

51:47.705 --> 51:49.273
And she should
at least have an outfit

51:49.273 --> 51:51.275
that looks presentable
and elevated,

51:51.275 --> 51:53.344
and this was kind of basic,
you guys.

51:53.344 --> 51:54.678
[RuPaul] Shuga.

51:54.678 --> 51:55.879
Her look
was one of my favorites.

51:55.879 --> 51:57.748
I would have never thought

51:57.748 --> 52:00.351
of a facekini
with a period gown.

52:00.351 --> 52:01.585
It looked
really uncomfortable,

52:01.585 --> 52:03.587
which always is a sign
that it looks good.

52:03.587 --> 52:04.621
[RuPaul] Yes.

52:04.621 --> 52:06.023
As far as the scene,

52:06.023 --> 52:09.526
she sort of suffered
from just being unmemorable.

52:09.526 --> 52:10.894
That's just what happens

52:10.894 --> 52:13.397
when you go up against
a juggernaut like the Reverend.

52:13.397 --> 52:15.566
But really she tried to bring it
and she just fell flat.

52:15.566 --> 52:17.201
[RuPaul] Her story
didn't make sense to me.

52:17.201 --> 52:20.137
She was the Reverend's wife
who died,

52:20.137 --> 52:23.340
but she had a young lover,
and she was coming onto the cop.

52:23.340 --> 52:24.775
I really couldn't follow it.

52:24.775 --> 52:26.076
Brooke Lynn Hytes.

52:26.076 --> 52:28.846
On the runway, it was
a real show stopping moment.

52:28.846 --> 52:30.581
Listen, I'm never going to say
that Brooke Lynn Hytes

52:30.581 --> 52:32.683
is the best actress
out of all these queens,

52:32.683 --> 52:35.652
but what I can say
is she delivered

52:35.652 --> 52:37.254
unlike she's ever
delivered before

52:37.254 --> 52:38.589
in this type of challenge.

52:38.589 --> 52:40.824
It's a body,
and it is beautiful.

52:40.824 --> 52:42.526
And it wasn't just
the physical comedy.

52:42.526 --> 52:44.661
She was thinking of
really funny shit to say,

52:44.661 --> 52:45.662
and that's what it was about.

52:45.662 --> 52:46.997
[RuPaul] Vanessa Vanjie Mateo.

52:46.997 --> 52:48.599
Tonight on the runway,
she changed it.

52:48.599 --> 52:51.135
I was really happy that she
didn't come out in a bodysuit.

52:51.135 --> 52:53.604
However, the shape
was a little off.

52:53.604 --> 52:55.606
I feel like there's something
kind of cool about it,

52:55.606 --> 52:57.708
that it wasn't
a perfect blowup doll.

52:57.708 --> 52:58.876
Like where the future is headed

52:58.876 --> 53:01.245
with actual blowup sex robots
and everything.

53:01.245 --> 53:03.414
You're obsessed with sex robots.

53:03.414 --> 53:04.782
Thank you for following me
on Twitter.

53:04.782 --> 53:07.151
Maybe it's hipper
somehow in the future

53:07.151 --> 53:10.287
to not have a great, you know,
big boobs and a big ass.

53:10.287 --> 53:11.622
Maybe it's a wrap
on all that.

53:11.622 --> 53:13.223
We're moving on.
Who knows?

53:13.223 --> 53:14.958
Acting challenge.

53:14.958 --> 53:16.560
Yeah, that was a challenge.

53:16.560 --> 53:18.862
It was really just--
it was all the same.

53:18.862 --> 53:20.364
Oh, you slept with my man.

53:20.364 --> 53:21.932
[Natasha]
It started so strong.

53:21.932 --> 53:23.467
I mean, I was like
what a saucy little minx.

53:23.467 --> 53:25.736
And then it just went nowhere.

53:25.736 --> 53:28.739
But there's a great deal
of spunk there.

53:28.739 --> 53:30.774
I think that's why
people really love her.

53:30.774 --> 53:33.610
But she's gotta learn
how to harness that energy

53:33.610 --> 53:35.379
and that charisma

53:35.379 --> 53:38.682
so that it works
in a professional situation.

53:38.682 --> 53:40.617
Plastique Tiara.

53:40.617 --> 53:42.853
If she had really gone
full facekini,

53:42.853 --> 53:44.154
it would have been awesome.

53:44.154 --> 53:45.522
Also, I don't know
if you felt this,

53:45.522 --> 53:47.224
in the challenge,

53:47.224 --> 53:48.892
I could tell she just felt
very out of her league,

53:48.892 --> 53:50.094
and really outside
of her comfort zone.

53:50.094 --> 53:51.361
She was so afraid,

53:51.361 --> 53:53.497
and you could feel it
in her body.

53:53.497 --> 53:55.866
You could feel it,
she was clinging to my leg.

53:55.866 --> 53:58.635
Yeah, maybe fell
the most flat for me

53:58.635 --> 53:59.837
out of everybody that I saw,

53:59.837 --> 54:02.339
the least dynamic
sort of change.

54:02.339 --> 54:04.908
[RuPaul] When you do open mic
the first time,

54:04.908 --> 54:07.244
you sort of rush through it
because you're so scared,

54:07.244 --> 54:09.179
and you almost
don't want to be there.

54:09.179 --> 54:10.948
That's the sense I got.

54:10.948 --> 54:12.516
At one point, I couldn't wait
for the scene to be over.

54:12.516 --> 54:14.151
Let's move on down

54:14.151 --> 54:17.521
to the biggest surprise of
the night, A'Keria C. Davenport.

54:17.521 --> 54:19.123
Yes, we've seen
this storyline before.

54:19.123 --> 54:20.958
No, we haven't
seen it done like that,

54:20.958 --> 54:25.028
including a facekini,
with sequins and rhinestones.

54:25.028 --> 54:26.897
I hope to look like that
by the end of next year.

54:26.897 --> 54:28.632
Oh, no, I truly believe
you will.

54:28.632 --> 54:29.766
-Thank you.
-Absolutely.

54:29.766 --> 54:31.568
In fact, I love
that she's having fun

54:31.568 --> 54:32.970
with the whole
plastic surgery storyline,

54:32.970 --> 54:34.304
because she makes no secret

54:34.304 --> 54:36.440
over the fact that
she's been touched by an angel.

54:36.440 --> 54:39.376
And I think A'Keria
should change her name

54:39.376 --> 54:41.979
to Clit Eastwood,
because she made my day.

54:41.979 --> 54:44.715
[all laugh]

54:44.715 --> 54:46.083
She was joyous to watch.

54:46.083 --> 54:48.252
Everything she committed to
paid off.

54:48.252 --> 54:50.487
But I also
was genuinely relieved

54:50.487 --> 54:51.822
to see her reunited
with her daughter,

54:51.822 --> 54:55.125
because she had taken me
on that ride.

54:55.125 --> 54:56.126
[all laugh]
Yes.

54:56.126 --> 54:57.928
If Brooke Lynn is most improved,

54:57.928 --> 55:00.130
then A'Keria's
best actress tonight.

55:00.130 --> 55:01.465
[Cheyenne] It was genius.

55:01.465 --> 55:03.700
I'm hearing we've got
the Marla Gibbs of drag

55:03.700 --> 55:06.603
on our stage.
[all laugh]

55:06.603 --> 55:09.406
Silence.

55:09.406 --> 55:11.942
I've made my decision.

55:11.942 --> 55:15.145
Bring back my jailbirds.

55:15.145 --> 55:17.047
[RuPaul] Welcome back, ladies.

55:17.047 --> 55:19.049
I've made some decisions.

55:21.818 --> 55:24.721
Silky Nutmeg Ganache.

55:24.721 --> 55:25.822
You're safe.

55:25.822 --> 55:27.257
Thank you.

55:29.326 --> 55:31.061
A'Keria C. Davenport.

55:31.061 --> 55:35.232
Girl, this week, you twerked
your way up into the top.

55:35.232 --> 55:36.934
[laughs]

55:36.934 --> 55:38.335
Con-drag-ulations.

55:38.335 --> 55:39.336
You are the winner
of this week's challenge.

55:39.336 --> 55:42.139
Thank you.
[applause]

55:42.139 --> 55:44.274
You've won two tickets

55:44.274 --> 55:48.779
to Cirque du Soleil's
sexy adult cabaret Zumanity,

55:48.779 --> 55:53.483
plus airfare and deluxe
Las Vegas accommodations.

55:53.483 --> 55:54.751
You may join the other girls.

55:54.751 --> 55:57.387
[applause and laughter]

55:59.556 --> 56:02.159
Whoo!
Twerk my way to the top.

56:03.961 --> 56:06.730
Brooke Lynn Hytes,
you're safe.

56:06.730 --> 56:08.498
Thank you very much.

56:11.969 --> 56:15.806
Shuga, this week
you did not take us to church.

56:17.107 --> 56:21.111
Vanjie, your alley cat
fell flat.

56:22.746 --> 56:26.250
Plastique, one word: me-ouch.

56:30.854 --> 56:31.855
Shuga Cain...

56:33.724 --> 56:35.125
You are safe.

56:35.125 --> 56:37.094
[exhales] Shit.

56:40.130 --> 56:41.331
You may join the other girls.

56:43.967 --> 56:47.070
Vanjie, Plastique,
I'm sorry, my dears,

56:47.070 --> 56:49.973
but you are up for elimination.

56:49.973 --> 56:53.810
At this point, most of
my frustration is with myself.

56:53.810 --> 56:56.346
Oh, I'm about
to start crying already.

56:59.916 --> 57:03.787
Just frustrated
because I want to do good.

57:03.787 --> 57:05.589
[sighs]

57:05.589 --> 57:08.458
Two queens stand before me.

57:08.458 --> 57:13.030
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me

57:13.030 --> 57:17.901
and save yourself
from elimination.

57:19.703 --> 57:21.438
The time has come...
[thunder]

57:21.438 --> 57:24.007
for you to lip sync...

57:24.007 --> 57:28.612
[echoing] for your life!

57:28.612 --> 57:30.080
[Plastique] I'm not going home.

57:30.080 --> 57:31.982
Not today.
Not tomorrow.

57:31.982 --> 57:33.984
Not ever.

57:33.984 --> 57:38.689
Good luck,
and don't fuck it up.
