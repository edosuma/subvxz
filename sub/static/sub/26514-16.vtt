[narrator] <i>Previously on </i> Dynasty:

00:13.430 --> 00:17.434
You recall agreeing to do an article
for <i>Contemporary Metropolitan Post?</i>

00:17.517 --> 00:18.893
I have everything I need.

00:18.977 --> 00:21.312
Keep an eye out for the article.
It's gonna be a doozy.

00:21.396 --> 00:23.648
The pre-site approval request denied.

00:23.732 --> 00:25.483
-I can't build my stadium.
-Let me handle it.

00:25.567 --> 00:27.861
I tried to buy his land for our stadium.

00:27.944 --> 00:30.572
I sold the land to DiFiore Exports.

00:30.655 --> 00:33.074
[in Spanish] You're now DiFiore Exports
and the land is yours.

00:33.158 --> 00:34.784
You didn't think Father would have settled

00:34.868 --> 00:36.536
for a long-distance thank you, did you?

00:38.246 --> 00:42.292
We're very alike, you and me.
We really are siblings. Two of a kind.

00:42.375 --> 00:47.630
Steven told me he saw Hank's positive DNA
results, which couldn't have been real.

00:47.714 --> 00:52.469
Not only were Hank's results not a match,
but they were signed for by you.

00:52.552 --> 00:54.429
Burn it. It'll be our little secret.

00:55.305 --> 00:56.389
[Alexis screaming]

00:59.517 --> 01:00.810
[ekg beeping]

01:04.647 --> 01:05.899
Oh, you're awake.

01:06.191 --> 01:07.650
[groaning]

01:07.734 --> 01:09.027
[ekg speeding up]

01:09.152 --> 01:13.615
Now, you're in a delicate state, Mother.
So, just relax and listen.

01:15.075 --> 01:18.578
Now, I am sorry about what happened
last night. I lost my temper.

01:19.746 --> 01:21.831
You have to understand how hurtful it was

01:21.915 --> 01:24.876
to know you were gonna turn away
your own son to protect yourself.

01:26.044 --> 01:27.045
[Alexis grunts]

01:27.128 --> 01:28.797
You're supposed to put
your children first.

01:29.881 --> 01:33.718
But that's why I'm here,
to teach you how to be a better mother.

01:34.385 --> 01:36.471
Can you imagine
what the rest of the family would think

01:36.554 --> 01:40.016
if they found out you were the one
that switched Hank's DNA results?

01:40.099 --> 01:42.101
I'll keep your secret if you keep mine.

01:43.645 --> 01:44.813
[Fallon] Oh, my God.

01:45.480 --> 01:47.649
-Is she okay?
-How did this happen?

01:47.732 --> 01:50.610
Well, she had a few too many to drink
last night

01:50.693 --> 01:53.530
-and tripped into the fireplace.
-Oh, well...

01:53.613 --> 01:55.198
I'm just glad I found her when I did.

01:55.281 --> 01:57.200
Mrs. Carrington was quite lucky.

01:57.283 --> 01:59.536
She does have some minor throat
and lung tissue damage

01:59.619 --> 02:01.371
from the heat and smoke inhalation,

02:01.454 --> 02:04.499
but we can fix the facial trauma
with skin grafts.

02:04.666 --> 02:07.168
Thanks to Adam's
expert first-aid response.

02:07.585 --> 02:10.255
We are so lucky
we have a doctor in the family.

02:10.338 --> 02:12.882
Uh, the word you're looking for
is veterinarian.

02:12.966 --> 02:15.635
-But, sure, good job.
-I can't help but feel responsible.

02:16.427 --> 02:18.930
My arrival here hasn't been easy
on anyone.

02:19.013 --> 02:21.850
-If that was the reason she was drinking--
-No, you can't blame yourself.

02:22.142 --> 02:26.146
No. We should blame the person
who rebuilt the loft with a fireplace.

02:26.229 --> 02:28.690
I mean, have you learned nothing?
Hi, Mommy.

02:28.773 --> 02:29.941
[groaning]

02:30.024 --> 02:34.028
Yeah, we should let her get some rest.
It'll be her instinct to talk,

02:34.112 --> 02:37.157
but to heal, it's important Mom
remain as silent as possible.

02:38.783 --> 02:41.494
I guess every fire has a silver lining.
[chuckles]

02:42.162 --> 02:43.496
Come on, lighten up.

02:43.580 --> 02:45.707
She's laughing with me. You're laughing.

02:46.708 --> 02:50.670
Maybe we could stick around today?
Take shifts looking after her?

02:50.753 --> 02:55.091
She'll be thrilled to have you on call
to massage her feet or whatever.

02:55.174 --> 02:57.176
But Daddy and I
have the Georgia Founders luncheon.

02:57.260 --> 03:00.346
I'm giving a speech. I'd invite you,
but our table is full.

03:01.222 --> 03:02.432
I'm sorry, Adam.

03:02.515 --> 03:05.268
-It's business. Len Miller--
-CEO of Nectacom.

03:05.351 --> 03:07.812
He's at our table.
I am this close to signing

03:07.896 --> 03:11.399
a lucrative naming-rights deal
for the new Atlantix stadium.

03:11.482 --> 03:14.569
Maybe after your conference
we could spend some time together.

03:15.403 --> 03:19.490
Tell you what, tomorrow
let's have a welcome home party for you.

03:20.783 --> 03:23.286
We're gonna make up for lost time.
Count on it.

03:26.122 --> 03:27.457
Hmm. That was cute.

03:28.416 --> 03:31.002
Maybe Daddy will teach you
how to shave before the big party.

03:31.502 --> 03:33.338
-I'm out of here.
-Are you?

03:48.061 --> 03:50.647
That smarmy little...

03:51.189 --> 03:52.565
-Fred.
-Good to see you.

03:52.649 --> 03:53.900
-Hi.
-Hello.

03:54.317 --> 03:56.110
Fallon and Blake Carrington.

03:56.861 --> 03:58.446
You will be at table 51.

03:58.738 --> 04:00.740
There's been some kind of mistake.

04:00.823 --> 04:04.744
Table 51 is in the bathroom.
We should be at table 1, like always.

04:04.827 --> 04:08.581
-Oh. Well, it's probably just a typo.
-I'm sorry, this is awkward.

04:08.665 --> 04:13.461
Someone should have e-mailed. We no longer
have time for Miss Carrington's speech.

04:13.544 --> 04:16.798
What, is this a joke?
She's delivering the opening statement.

04:17.464 --> 04:18.298
[Fallon] Oh.

04:18.382 --> 04:22.303
No, you know our names, but obviously
you are clueless as to who we are.

04:22.387 --> 04:23.513
Daddy. Um...

04:26.015 --> 04:29.644
Do you remember that day-in-the-life story
I did for <i>Contemporary Metro?</i>

04:29.727 --> 04:33.940
Well, the article dropped today
and it was not exactly kind.

04:34.315 --> 04:36.067
-How not kind was it?
-Um...

04:36.401 --> 04:41.030
Len. Hi. We'll meet you inside. I'm just
dealing with a little seating mix-up.

04:41.114 --> 04:43.199
Seating should be the least
of your problems right now.

04:43.324 --> 04:45.326
-Excuse me?
-You're asking Nectacom

04:45.410 --> 04:47.787
to make an expensive 20-year commitment.

04:47.870 --> 04:51.291
But your daughter's publicity
doesn't exactly instill confidence.

04:51.374 --> 04:54.585
I don't know if it's in our best interest
to be associated with the Carrington name.

04:54.669 --> 04:57.630
I can assure you
our brand has never been stronger.

04:57.714 --> 05:00.341
This team's my top priority.
We'll clear this up in Monday's meeting.

05:00.675 --> 05:01.926
We'll see about that.

05:04.304 --> 05:05.847
Daddy, I can explain.

05:05.930 --> 05:07.932
It's one thing for you to damage
your own reputation,

05:08.016 --> 05:11.144
but now you're bringing everyone else
down with you. Make this right.

05:20.611 --> 05:22.030
[in Spanish] What do you want, Beto?

05:22.113 --> 05:26.743
Christy! You never got on the plane.
Even after I sprung for first class.

05:26.826 --> 05:28.161
I'm not going back home to Mexico.

05:28.244 --> 05:29.746
I already told you.

05:29.829 --> 05:32.540
Father should know this by now.

05:32.623 --> 05:34.542
You can't blame him.
He wants his daughter back.

05:35.251 --> 05:38.004
Oy. Forgive me if I don't shed a tear.

05:38.087 --> 05:41.466
Once a traitor. Always a traitor.

05:41.883 --> 05:43.593
You know what? I'm going to hang up.

05:43.676 --> 05:44.802
Goodbye, little brother.

05:46.179 --> 05:47.138
[sighs]

05:47.889 --> 05:49.182
[knocking on door]

05:55.646 --> 05:58.274
I think our call got disconnected.

06:04.447 --> 06:08.284
[Fallon] Thank you for coming. This
is unorthodox for a first-time author,

06:08.367 --> 06:10.953
but you won't regret the trek
from downtown.

06:11.037 --> 06:13.998
You've seen the tabloids,
read the hit pieces.

06:14.082 --> 06:18.336
You think you know Fallon Carrington,
[laughs] but trust me, you don't.

06:18.878 --> 06:23.007
I'd like to introduce you to your new
bestseller. The story of my life.

06:24.842 --> 06:27.303
It's part self-help, part memoir.

06:27.678 --> 06:30.556
A strategy bible
for young women to live by.

06:30.640 --> 06:32.141
It's an erotic thriller.

06:32.600 --> 06:35.311
I mean, empowerment in the workplace
is sexy.

06:35.394 --> 06:38.648
I'd like to introduce you
to Fallon's three virtues to victory.

06:38.731 --> 06:40.483
Number one, confidence.

06:40.566 --> 06:41.609
Number two--

06:41.692 --> 06:45.196
We don't really need another <i>Lean In.</i>
Sorry. But it's a pass.

06:45.279 --> 06:48.282
Despite having a father
with borderline alcoholism

06:48.366 --> 06:50.451
and a mother
with borderline everything else,

06:50.535 --> 06:52.703
I think it's impressive
I was able to rise above it and--

06:52.787 --> 06:56.791
We've met our quota for women-
in-the-workplace books. But good luck.

06:57.083 --> 07:01.754
Okay. That concludes my pitch.
Someone from the staff will show you out

07:01.838 --> 07:04.674
and the goody bags
are for potential buyers only.

07:04.757 --> 07:06.551
So, don't even think about it.

07:08.177 --> 07:10.012
I'm excited about this, Fallon.

07:10.763 --> 07:14.058
About what?
Oh, I mean, yeah. Yeah, of course you are.

07:14.142 --> 07:17.353
This is exactly the kind of book
that Elcott Publishing needs.

07:17.645 --> 07:20.606
You're in the Zeitgeist right now,
and we would love to capitalize on that.

07:20.690 --> 07:23.234
Let's turn this book around
in a month or so

07:23.317 --> 07:25.486
like Stormy Daniels or Omarosa did.

07:25.570 --> 07:28.698
I don't love the comparisons,
but I like where your head is at.

07:28.781 --> 07:30.116
Time is of the essence.

07:30.199 --> 07:33.369
Precisely.
We'd love to pair you with a ghostwriter

07:33.453 --> 07:36.664
that best realizes your vision.
I have the perfect guy.

07:36.747 --> 07:39.584
He is a pro at writing memoirs
in record speed.

07:40.126 --> 07:40.960
Hmm.

07:41.878 --> 07:46.132
Can he be here by 3? Because I'd like
to have this on the bestseller list by 4.

07:49.177 --> 07:51.429
[theme song playing]

08:13.576 --> 08:17.121
-[in Spanish] I'm not going back, Beto.
-Calm down. Relax.

08:17.205 --> 08:21.167
I know, even though Father was hopeful,
he has another favor.

08:22.543 --> 08:26.714
There's a free agent on the market,
a midfielder. His name is Carlos Aguirre.

08:28.090 --> 08:30.718
You are going to offer him a position
on your new soccer team.

08:32.260 --> 08:34.013
You must think I'm a fool.

08:34.096 --> 08:37.099
Obviously Father has this Carlos
in his pocket.

08:37.183 --> 08:41.145
He wants to get him on the team to control
the Atlantix. And therefore, control me.

08:41.520 --> 08:43.606
No. It's not going to happen. I'm sorry.

08:44.565 --> 08:45.816
That's okay.
I'm not leaving until you do it.

08:50.196 --> 08:51.280
There you are.

08:51.364 --> 08:53.032
I'm off, have a busy day.

08:53.407 --> 08:55.618
-Oh, who's this?
-[in English] This is Beto.

08:55.868 --> 08:57.537
Um, he's Sam's cousin.

08:58.162 --> 08:59.288
[in Spanish] What?

09:00.122 --> 09:04.460
Uh, he and I were just getting acquainted.
He's gonna be in town for a few days.

09:04.544 --> 09:07.505
I told him he's welcome to stay
in our guest bedroom.

09:08.005 --> 09:08.965
It's a pleasure.

09:09.048 --> 09:10.466
[Sam] Who is he?

09:10.841 --> 09:12.468
And why did you tell Blake he's my cousin?

09:13.678 --> 09:16.430
Uh, Sam.
[in Spanish] This is my brother, Beto.

09:16.514 --> 09:21.561
Can you please entertain him
while I handle some family business?

09:22.478 --> 09:23.896
Beto, don't say anything.

09:23.980 --> 09:25.565
I'll repay the debt. You have my word.

09:25.648 --> 09:28.276
You will forgive me
if I stick around anyway.

09:28.359 --> 09:31.320
Your word means very little to me.
[laughs]

09:32.863 --> 09:36.117
[in English] Blake.
My love, I'll meet you at the office.

09:36.450 --> 09:39.453
I need to talk to Michael
about player acquisitions.

09:39.704 --> 09:42.873
It's wonderful you're taking an interest
in our team.

09:45.418 --> 09:46.711
Enjoy your stay. Um...

09:47.128 --> 09:48.212
[speaking in Spanish]

09:50.131 --> 09:50.965
[sighs]

09:54.093 --> 09:57.054
I've done baseline neurocognitive
risk assessments on all the players.

09:57.138 --> 09:58.389
The Martinez results.

09:58.764 --> 10:01.559
It's a good thing.
Everybody's in playing shape.

10:01.684 --> 10:04.604
Mr. Carrington,
your son is here to see you.

10:05.730 --> 10:07.940
[George] Hope I'm not interrupting.
I can come back later.

10:08.024 --> 10:10.192
No, no. Adam, I'd like you to meet
Dr. Arthur Glennon.

10:10.276 --> 10:13.321
He's the Atlantix team doctor
and a close friend of the family.

10:13.988 --> 10:16.532
-A pleasure to meet you, Dr. Glennon.
-Join us.

10:22.705 --> 10:25.416
-Those the players?
-Just their heads, but yes.

10:25.708 --> 10:28.753
Have you started using VR to detect
previous head injuries and trauma?

10:28.836 --> 10:33.466
I took a seminar on how the technology
can be applied to sports medicine.

10:33.549 --> 10:35.718
-You work in medicine?
-Adam's a doctor.

10:36.427 --> 10:40.014
I was a resident in family medicine.

10:40.097 --> 10:42.433
But being a team doctor,
that was my end game.

10:43.100 --> 10:46.312
I was a few months away
from an orthopedics fellowship.

10:48.314 --> 10:50.274
Adam was dealt a bad hand.

10:51.400 --> 10:52.985
God, I do miss all this.

10:55.279 --> 10:58.115
I've prepared questions.
We'll go through those.

10:58.199 --> 11:01.619
Shape is gonna start to shake out,
then I'm gonna build on that.

11:02.244 --> 11:03.996
Building a shape. I love it.

11:04.080 --> 11:04.914
-Hit me.
-Okay.

11:05.956 --> 11:08.501
Ahem. How long does it take for you
to get ready in the morning?

11:08.584 --> 11:11.712
-Ew. No. Pass.
-What is your ideal leisure activity?

11:11.796 --> 11:15.508
-Reading quarterly earnings reports.
-As a prominent business heiress,

11:15.591 --> 11:19.178
-can you talk a bit about the dating pool?
-I can, but I won't.

11:19.887 --> 11:22.390
Really? Are all your questions this vapid?

11:22.473 --> 11:26.394
I mean, you do realize that I was
the CEO of a Fortune 500 company?

11:26.477 --> 11:29.313
-You can't just ask me--
-For two months, right?

11:29.397 --> 11:30.648
Yes. For two months.

11:30.731 --> 11:34.527
But two months as a CEO
is like ten years in normal job time.

11:34.860 --> 11:36.404
Look, I am a professional

11:36.487 --> 11:40.032
and I have worked very, very hard
to earn a name for myself.

11:41.700 --> 11:43.744
So, Ibiza or the Hamptons?

11:44.412 --> 11:45.246
[groans]

11:45.955 --> 11:48.457
The Hamptons in spring, Ibiza in summer.

11:48.541 --> 11:49.959
[knocking on door]

11:51.293 --> 11:54.755
-Do you have a moment?
-Of course. Congratulations are in order.

11:55.256 --> 11:57.967
Just a few days away from breaking ground
on the new stadium.

11:58.050 --> 11:59.760
Well, we both did our part.

12:01.720 --> 12:04.890
-What's this?
-Carlos Aguirre. He's a legend in Mexico.

12:04.974 --> 12:07.476
He is looking to make the transition
to an American league.

12:07.560 --> 12:12.314
We're locked tight on midfielders.
To be honest, he is a little old.

12:12.731 --> 12:15.860
We don't need to use him.
We just need to hire him.

12:16.402 --> 12:19.947
Seems like an expensive paperweight.
Care to tell me what's going on?

12:21.907 --> 12:25.661
Carlos is a family friend.
He used to play for my parents' team.

12:25.911 --> 12:26.996
We don't need him,

12:27.079 --> 12:31.167
but my family did us a favor
by helping us secure the stadium land.

12:31.250 --> 12:34.462
They just wanna make sure
he finds a good team to call home

12:34.545 --> 12:35.546
at the end of his career.

12:41.218 --> 12:43.304
-I'll see what I can do.
-Thank you.

12:44.513 --> 12:45.681
[ekg beeping]

12:48.184 --> 12:49.018
Alexis.

12:49.310 --> 12:52.396
I am so sorry. I came as soon as I heard.

12:53.147 --> 12:54.523
Is the pain just awful?

12:58.444 --> 13:00.821
Hey, I'm here for you. Anything you need.

13:01.280 --> 13:03.741
We owe you. You looked out for us
when no one else would.

13:06.744 --> 13:10.539
You should come stay with me.
I'll make sure my house is equipped

13:10.623 --> 13:12.124
with everything you need.
All the best care.

13:18.255 --> 13:19.924
-Can I help you?
-I doubt it.

13:21.383 --> 13:22.218
I'm Adam.

13:23.010 --> 13:24.345
Blake and Alexis' son.

13:24.970 --> 13:26.013
The Adam?

13:26.096 --> 13:27.348
[ekg speeding up]

13:29.433 --> 13:30.309
Oh, uh...

13:30.726 --> 13:34.104
-Jeff Colby. I guess we're cousins.
-Pleasure to meet you, Jeff.

13:34.813 --> 13:37.441
Hey, I'm gonna have Alexis
moved out of here.

13:38.025 --> 13:41.320
You're welcome to visit
while she recovers at my estate.

13:42.530 --> 13:45.658
Is your estate a verified burn center?
No offense.

13:45.741 --> 13:48.577
She'll receive the best care
under the Carrington watch.

13:49.787 --> 13:52.289
Look, it's her decision to make
and she already said yes.

13:56.710 --> 13:58.087
Oh, I see.

14:01.257 --> 14:02.174
A pleasure to meet you.

14:04.718 --> 14:06.929
I will be back to help you move soon.

14:14.520 --> 14:15.563
Okay.

14:18.065 --> 14:19.733
I look forward to getting to know you,
Jeff.

14:25.656 --> 14:29.827
Um, I wanna circle back
to the fight in the pool with your mother.

14:30.911 --> 14:32.204
I won. The end.

14:33.122 --> 14:36.208
Listen, Dale,
I don't think we're seeing eye to eye.

14:36.292 --> 14:39.295
-Why don't I give Stuart a call?
-Okay, but this is what Stuart asked for.

14:39.378 --> 14:41.505
The fights, the scandals, all of it.

14:41.589 --> 14:44.300
No. No way. That's not what I sold him on.

14:44.383 --> 14:45.342
Well, I'm sorry.

14:45.926 --> 14:48.804
I'm sure
it's all just a big miscommunication.

14:48.888 --> 14:51.599
You wanna talk business?
Sure, let's talk business.

14:52.266 --> 14:54.935
-Thank you.
-On Morell Green Energy Corp

14:55.019 --> 14:56.145
and Jeff Colby,

14:56.228 --> 14:58.898
what was it like to find out
you were sleeping with your cousin?

15:01.317 --> 15:06.030
Interesting question. What was it like for
you to find out you'd just been fired?

15:06.655 --> 15:09.992
Really? I'm not good enough
to work for you? That's rich.

15:10.075 --> 15:11.076
Excuse me?

15:11.160 --> 15:13.537
I accepted this job
for the absurd paycheck that came with it.

15:13.621 --> 15:17.041
On the condition that my name
wouldn't appear anywhere near this book.

15:17.958 --> 15:19.835
Good thing you're just a hack.

15:20.336 --> 15:22.963
Now get your sorry ass
out of my house. Now.

15:23.047 --> 15:28.302
You have nothing to show for yourself
but a string of failures and scandals.

15:28.385 --> 15:31.180
Now you want a memoir
celebrating your success.

15:32.598 --> 15:34.308
Sure, I'm the hack.

15:34.683 --> 15:36.185
You're an entitled little rich bitch.

15:39.188 --> 15:40.314
Get out!

15:43.150 --> 15:46.612
Good luck finding anybody
to read your little vanity piece.

15:47.655 --> 15:48.489
Or write it.

15:51.367 --> 15:53.035
I'll send you the bill for this.

16:02.044 --> 16:06.423
Adam. Hold on a sec.
Where are you off to in such a hurry?

16:06.674 --> 16:08.425
-Everything all right?
-You tell me.

16:09.051 --> 16:11.679
I was just on the phone
with the Georgia Medical Association.

16:13.263 --> 16:15.849
And they have approved your application
for a medical license

16:15.933 --> 16:19.853
effective immediately. Congratulations,
you are now Dr. Carrington.

16:19.937 --> 16:22.314
I thought I was gonna have to wait years
to go through miles of red tape
before I could practice again.

16:24.858 --> 16:28.195
You're a Carrington now.
We don't do red tape.

16:28.278 --> 16:29.655
Congratulations.

16:30.739 --> 16:31.657
You deserve it.

16:32.700 --> 16:34.493
I don't know how to thank you.

16:34.576 --> 16:38.872
By coming to work for the business
at Atlantix alongside Dr. Glennon.

16:38.956 --> 16:41.959
Starting today.
If you're still interested, that is.

16:42.042 --> 16:43.961
Of course. That'd be incredible.

16:44.169 --> 16:45.879
You're gonna love working for Dr. Glennon.

16:46.672 --> 16:48.841
He and his wife
seem to work well together.

16:50.050 --> 16:53.929
-Susan. From the office, that's his wife.
-No, no. Um...
He's married, and happily, I might add.
No, Susan's his assistant.

16:58.058 --> 17:01.270
Oh. Forget I said anything.
I must have misread something.

17:01.353 --> 17:03.605
-You must have.
-Can't wait to get started.

17:05.566 --> 17:06.900
Has anyone seen Blake?

17:07.358 --> 17:10.069
Last time I checked,
Mr. Carrington was with Adam.

17:10.154 --> 17:13.449
Ugh. Great. Dad is playing catch
with his adult son.

17:13.531 --> 17:15.451
Sam is off doing God knows what.

17:15.534 --> 17:18.746
And I am left here seeking counsel
from the majordomo.

17:18.829 --> 17:20.622
-No offense, Anders.
-None taken.

17:20.705 --> 17:23.584
I have neither the time
nor the desire to assist.

17:23.666 --> 17:28.630
-We are preparing for Adam's party.
-What's there to do? Guy's from Montana.

17:28.714 --> 17:32.551
Toss up streamers and a tray
of Vienna sausages and call it a day.

17:32.634 --> 17:36.513
I have real problems
and I am all out of people to complain to.

17:37.056 --> 17:39.016
There is one with room in her schedule.

17:40.934 --> 17:44.646
Naturally, I came to you first.
If anyone knows how to weasel their way

17:44.730 --> 17:49.193
out of a tricky situation, it's you.
And I came to check on you. Obviously.

17:49.568 --> 17:52.488
So, I get why Stuart wants to cancel
my book deal.

17:52.571 --> 17:55.032
That idiot Dale left me no choice
but to fire him.

17:55.783 --> 17:58.577
Oh, fire, I'm sorry. Poor choice of words.

17:58.660 --> 18:02.623
Anyway, people are expecting a book
from me. I can't self-publish.

18:02.706 --> 18:05.793
Self-publishing is for weirdos
whose fan fiction isn't good enough

18:05.876 --> 18:06.752
to leave the Internet.

18:07.044 --> 18:12.758
I also screwed up Daddy's stadium deal.
I'm still working on a solve for that one.

18:13.217 --> 18:14.968
Try to keep up, Mom. Please.

18:15.552 --> 18:18.889
I admit I'd normally go to Daddy
for professional advice,

18:18.972 --> 18:22.226
but he's busy planning parties
for his long-lost son.

18:25.729 --> 18:28.398
Which I could use to my advantage.

18:28.816 --> 18:32.611
I will invite both Stuart and Len
to this dumb party.

18:33.070 --> 18:36.448
After I force the publishers
to get onboard with my book,

18:36.532 --> 18:38.992
I can convince Len
the Carrington bubble hasn't burst.

18:39.535 --> 18:41.537
Yes. I just have to do one thing first.

18:43.747 --> 18:46.458
Thank you, Mommy.
You have never been more helpful.

18:49.628 --> 18:51.547
[pop music playing on speakers]

18:52.131 --> 18:53.549
[man] Over here, sweetheart.

18:53.632 --> 18:56.093
[Sam] Nothing like a strip club
in the middle of the day.

18:56.176 --> 19:00.264
-You, uh, know I'm gay, right?
-You can still enjoy the view, though.

19:00.722 --> 19:03.767
-Give me your finest bottle of Moscato.
-You got it, honey. Whoo!

19:03.851 --> 19:04.768
Hey.

19:05.561 --> 19:06.895
I'm sorry.

19:07.479 --> 19:09.481
-What the hell?
-Oh, relax.

19:11.441 --> 19:13.986
-Hey, baby. You want a dance?
-Hey, mami.

19:14.486 --> 19:20.117
Listen, um, my friend here wants a dance,
but he's a little shy.

19:22.911 --> 19:24.496
-What are you looking for today?
-Oh, hey.

19:25.581 --> 19:26.415
Hey.

19:26.748 --> 19:27.708
Um...

19:28.208 --> 19:30.794
I'm actually good, but thank you.

19:31.170 --> 19:34.840
You look really hot. Beautiful.
I mean, look at that booty.

19:34.923 --> 19:38.468
I can't tell who's more spoiled
and ungrateful. You or my sister.

19:38.594 --> 19:40.220
It's like you ladies deserve each other.

19:42.931 --> 19:44.391
Okay. All right.

19:45.559 --> 19:50.230
Listen, maybe it's cool to be
a homophobic sexist in your family, okay,

19:50.314 --> 19:51.857
but I'm not gonna sit here

19:51.940 --> 19:54.818
and let you bash me
and trash-talk your sister, all right?

19:55.360 --> 19:58.697
Hey!
Cristal has been through a lot lately.

19:58.947 --> 20:01.450
And it's not like you or your family
have been there for her.

20:01.783 --> 20:03.702
Don't talk about things
you don't understand, Sam.

20:04.328 --> 20:05.996
Cristal's lucky she's blood.

20:06.246 --> 20:09.291
Because in my family, traitors disappear
for much less than what she's done.

20:09.625 --> 20:12.794
-What's she done?
-You should ask your friend why I'm here.

20:15.714 --> 20:18.217
Who do I have to bang to get a drink, huh?

20:18.592 --> 20:19.509
Huh?

20:23.722 --> 20:24.723
[camera clicks]

20:25.307 --> 20:29.144
Can we get a landline? Somehow it feels
less dramatic with a cell.

20:29.353 --> 20:30.854
Make that happen, please.

20:38.487 --> 20:43.200
Um... Okay. I thought you were writing
a memoir, not modeling pantsuits.

20:43.283 --> 20:45.786
I need a photo for the cover.
What do you think?

20:45.869 --> 20:49.331
I think you may have forgotten the part
where you actually write the book first.

20:50.290 --> 20:51.124
Have I?
[man] Yeah.

20:56.797 --> 21:00.008
Philip is nearly through chapter six,
my college years.

21:00.425 --> 21:02.135
He's a <i>New York Times</i>
bestselling memoirist.

21:02.219 --> 21:06.181
Audrey, one of Oprah's top picks,
is outlining my takeover of CA.

21:06.265 --> 21:09.351
We're multitasking, which is
covered in detail in chapter four.

21:09.434 --> 21:13.188
Fallon, I know you like a challenge,
but this is insane.

21:13.272 --> 21:14.815
No, it's proof of concept.

21:15.148 --> 21:19.111
I realized the only way to make Stuart see
my vision for this book

21:19.194 --> 21:22.739
is to let him see my book physically
in his hands.

21:22.823 --> 21:26.076
Len has to see the Carringtons
are just a few weeks away

21:26.159 --> 21:28.578
-from being back on top.
-Well, this is exciting.

21:29.621 --> 21:32.124
-What do you want?
-I'm just proud of you.

21:32.207 --> 21:34.209
Proud of your book.
I just wanted to congratulate you

21:34.293 --> 21:35.961
before my first day at the office.

21:36.044 --> 21:38.463
Off to give a Pomeranian a prostate exam?

21:38.922 --> 21:42.426
No. Actually I'm gonna be working
with the team doctor at the Atlantix.

21:43.176 --> 21:45.637
Dad got my license reinstated.
I'm a doctor again.

21:46.305 --> 21:47.973
He did that in one day?

21:48.390 --> 21:49.308
Mm-hm.

21:49.850 --> 21:51.393
Carringtons don't do red tape.

21:55.397 --> 21:57.691
Looking forward to working with you.

21:57.774 --> 22:01.737
The chance to work alongside my father,
make decisions for the team,

22:02.029 --> 22:03.697
that's like a dream come true.

22:04.531 --> 22:08.452
Just to be clear, coordinating
with Blake on the health of the team,

22:08.535 --> 22:11.496
dealing with injuries to star players,
that's mostly my job.

22:13.874 --> 22:15.000
-Okay.
-But there'll be plenty

22:15.083 --> 22:16.335
of important work for you to do.

22:17.627 --> 22:22.090
-I hope you're not disappointed.
-Of course not. I'm just happy to be here.

22:22.174 --> 22:26.178
Good. If you'll excuse me,
gotta meet Blake at the training facility.

22:26.261 --> 22:29.222
But Susan will set you up
with everything you need.

22:29.306 --> 22:32.017
Thank you so much, Dr. Glennon.
I'll walk out with you.

22:40.692 --> 22:43.904
Oh, forgot my bag.
I got it. I'll catch you later.

23:22.859 --> 23:23.693
How do I look?
Upgrade.

23:29.282 --> 23:32.786
For you. Excuse me,
can you give us a minute please?

23:32.869 --> 23:35.789
-[woman] Of course.
-And take these things.

23:36.998 --> 23:41.044
Thank you. It looks great.
It's really, really incredible. Thank you.

23:44.714 --> 23:48.510
There is one thing
I wanted to talk to you about. Jeff Colby.

23:49.010 --> 23:50.846
Something about him rubs me wrong.

23:51.263 --> 23:53.306
I'm not sure
he's got your best interests at heart.

23:53.390 --> 23:57.644
I think it's best if you stay here
under my care as you heal.

23:58.353 --> 23:59.521
[ekg speeding up]

23:59.604 --> 24:01.731
I mean, we are a team now, aren't we?

24:09.156 --> 24:10.031
Wow.

24:11.575 --> 24:13.660
You looked a lot like Fallon
when you were younger.

24:15.078 --> 24:16.496
[ekg slowing down]

24:20.375 --> 24:21.877
Well, I should get going.

24:22.878 --> 24:25.755
I'm sorry you can't join,
but I have a party to attend.

24:25.839 --> 24:27.174
[jazz music playing]

24:30.969 --> 24:32.179
[chattering]

24:41.271 --> 24:42.230
Oh!

24:42.647 --> 24:44.024
Stuart.

24:44.441 --> 24:47.319
So glad you could make it.
Thank you for coming.

24:47.652 --> 24:52.365
Of course. It's a nice party, Fallon,
but the setting doesn't change the fact

24:52.449 --> 24:54.743
you fired our writer.
You should've talked to us first.

24:54.826 --> 24:58.788
I know. But I've always been one
for doing rather than talking.

25:00.498 --> 25:02.417
-Thank you.
-What's this?

25:02.918 --> 25:05.962
This is my memoir, hot off the presses.

25:06.046 --> 25:08.256
You've written an entire book
in less than 24 hours?

25:08.340 --> 25:11.593
Well, admittedly it's only
the first eight chapters, but--

25:12.469 --> 25:16.181
Consider it Exhibit A of my commitment
to making this book a success.

25:16.264 --> 25:19.768
When Fallon sets her mind to something,
there's no stopping her.

25:19.851 --> 25:22.312
Which you can read all about
in chapter seven. "Perseverance."

25:22.395 --> 25:25.148
Heh. What can I say? I'm blown away.

25:25.232 --> 25:26.983
I'm not quite sure
how you pulled this off,

25:27.067 --> 25:29.402
but you're on to something
with this lady-boss angle.

25:29.486 --> 25:30.403
[chuckles]

25:30.779 --> 25:33.406
I'm confident
we can find another ghostwriter

25:33.490 --> 25:36.868
-to fulfill your vision.
-Let's fulfill the hell out of it.

25:37.077 --> 25:37.953
[chuckles]

25:38.036 --> 25:39.412
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

25:42.540 --> 25:44.584
Can't believe Dad would do all this
just for me.

25:44.709 --> 25:47.712
Calm down. Last year we threw a party
for the dog and it was better.

25:48.922 --> 25:52.175
I know you don't like
sharing the spotlight, but Dad's--

25:52.259 --> 25:55.387
He's going overboard,
trying to make up for lost time.

25:55.470 --> 25:58.181
I don't care.
You know you can call him Blake.

25:58.265 --> 26:01.977
Oh, but you should definitely kiss him
on the mouth. He'd love that.

26:10.402 --> 26:14.864
Susan. Dr. Glennon was looking for you.
About next week's schedule.

26:14.948 --> 26:17.534
-I think he's over by the piano.
-Oh, sure, thanks.

26:21.997 --> 26:23.081
[cell phone buzzes]

26:27.711 --> 26:29.296
[cell phones buzzing]

26:36.344 --> 26:37.178
Oh, my--

26:40.765 --> 26:42.892
Blake. There's something you need to see.

26:43.727 --> 26:46.187
-What am I looking at?
-These files were just uploaded

26:46.271 --> 26:48.732
to the Atlantix shared folder
by Arthur Glennon.

26:48.815 --> 26:50.442
These are mostly women from the office.

26:50.525 --> 26:53.570
I think it was a mistake,
but it gets worse.

26:54.529 --> 26:55.488
[Blake] Oh, my God.

26:57.282 --> 26:58.366
Adam was right about him.
[cell phone ringing]

27:01.828 --> 27:02.829
Yeah, it's Blake.

27:03.955 --> 27:05.874
Yeah, I just saw it.

27:08.835 --> 27:09.794
[sighs]

27:12.630 --> 27:13.465
There you are.

27:14.049 --> 27:16.885
Please tell me there weren't any problems
signing Carlos Aguirre.

27:16.968 --> 27:17.802
About that.

27:18.511 --> 27:20.764
-I can't do it.
-I don't understand.

27:20.847 --> 27:22.223
I know what's going on.

27:22.557 --> 27:24.184
Your story didn't quite sit right with me.

27:24.267 --> 27:28.938
The Flores family has hired a couple
of players near retirement in the past,

27:29.022 --> 27:32.233
and those players were prone to errors
during games

27:32.317 --> 27:34.110
where there were an unusual amount
of bets.

27:34.402 --> 27:40.367
Okay, fine. My father was trying to use
Carlos to throw games and turn a profit.

27:40.533 --> 27:42.786
But he won't get that far, I promise.

27:43.286 --> 27:44.871
Michael, please.

27:44.954 --> 27:47.415
No. I went down that road with Ada.

27:48.041 --> 27:50.585
I nearly lost everything.
I won't do it again.

27:53.046 --> 27:54.089
I'll see you inside.

27:59.219 --> 28:00.970
You seriously need to spill.

28:01.054 --> 28:04.724
I don't know what your hot,
evil brother is holding over you,
but if I'm gonna babysit any longer,
we need to discuss my fee.

28:08.561 --> 28:12.273
It doesn't matter now.
I owe him and I failed.

28:13.024 --> 28:15.402
-I don't know what to do.
-You're family.

28:15.485 --> 28:18.363
-I'm sure you'll figure something out.
-No, we won't, Sam.

28:19.114 --> 28:23.535
My family is not gonna just let this go.
They tried to destroy my life once.

28:23.618 --> 28:24.536
They will do it again.

28:33.503 --> 28:34.504
Oh, wow.

28:34.963 --> 28:38.758
-You know how to wear a suit.
-One leg at a time, last I checked.

28:38.842 --> 28:41.928
-You're not so bad yourself.
-Hey, it's not my first party.

28:42.720 --> 28:46.391
Mm. Hey, how's that kick-the-habit thing
going? Still good?

28:46.474 --> 28:50.812
Heh. It's great. Actually, I could use
a little help if you're up for it.

28:51.646 --> 28:55.442
Well, I'm up for anything. If you need me,
you know where to find me, boss.

29:03.533 --> 29:05.994
Beto, it's time for us to have a talk.

29:06.661 --> 29:07.495
No.

29:08.079 --> 29:10.707
[clearing throat]
Beto, enough of this nonsense.

29:11.082 --> 29:11.916
No.

29:12.917 --> 29:14.210
Why wasn't I made meaner?

29:15.628 --> 29:16.796
Okay.

29:18.798 --> 29:19.632
Beto.

29:20.633 --> 29:22.886
[Beto] I told you to lock the door!
Get out!

29:22.969 --> 29:24.929
-Now! Both of you!
-I'm sorry.

29:25.013 --> 29:26.264
Get out.

29:29.434 --> 29:30.351
[sighs]

29:32.145 --> 29:36.775
The Carrington name is going up in value,
and slapping "Nectacom" on our stadium

29:36.858 --> 29:38.943
would increase your brand awareness
by 30 percent.

29:39.027 --> 29:42.530
Trust me, once the stadium is built,
nobody will care about that article.

29:44.032 --> 29:46.826
Tell your father we'll see him on Monday
to continue negotiations.

29:46.910 --> 29:49.537
-I'll do that. You enjoy the party.
-Thanks.

29:52.415 --> 29:54.751
[man] Think her dad's
gonna make another toast?

29:55.084 --> 29:56.586
Oh, yeah, I'm sure he will.

29:56.669 --> 29:59.881
I hear Blake always makes some speech
at these parties.

29:59.964 --> 30:01.800
Hey, I gave him my card.

30:02.217 --> 30:06.596
He seemed very interested.
I mean, can you imagine the pre-sales?

30:06.679 --> 30:09.224
Shame we had to spend
so much time humoring the daughter.

30:09.808 --> 30:11.935
Heh. Please, just do me a favor.

30:12.018 --> 30:15.355
Find me a ghostwriter who knows
how to nod and smile.

30:15.438 --> 30:17.774
I wanna get this over with
so we can move on to Blake.

30:24.405 --> 30:27.784
-They pulled him over in Africa to speak.
-Really, Arthur? Huh?

30:28.076 --> 30:30.370
-My own daughter? You're disgusting.
-[music stops]

30:31.037 --> 30:33.289
What? There's been a mistake.

30:33.373 --> 30:37.085
I'm sure, huh? I'm sure you didn't mean
to send this out far and wide

30:37.168 --> 30:38.378
to the entire Atlantix company.

30:38.461 --> 30:40.255
But it's probably hard to type
with one hand.

30:40.880 --> 30:44.092
You cheat on your wife all you want,
but stay away from my daughter.

30:44.175 --> 30:46.511
I don't know what you're talking about.

30:46.678 --> 30:49.180
-I would never cheat on my wife.
-Well, she's not here.

30:49.264 --> 30:53.101
-Because she's at home. Sick.
-Does she know about your spank bank?

30:53.184 --> 30:54.018
[crowd groans]

30:55.395 --> 30:57.188
Those are not my pictures.

30:57.272 --> 31:00.525
Save it for court. I've talked
to the board already. You're fired.

31:05.822 --> 31:07.031
Just throwing out trash.

31:08.032 --> 31:08.867
Play.

31:08.950 --> 31:09.951
[music resumes]

31:12.161 --> 31:13.121
[knocking on door]

31:18.251 --> 31:23.923
I brought a peace offering.
You can have both of them if you want.

31:25.925 --> 31:28.052
Look, you don't have to talk to me.

31:28.136 --> 31:31.848
But I remember how lonely it was
before I came out. So...

31:35.018 --> 31:35.852
Okay.

31:38.271 --> 31:39.606
I'm not gay, you know.

31:40.398 --> 31:42.775
Hey, who said anything about labels?

31:43.318 --> 31:46.321
It's 2019,
and sexuality is a social construct.

31:47.614 --> 31:51.576
I was talking about me.
And I never came out to my father.

31:52.535 --> 31:56.080
I always felt this pressure
to put on an overly manly charade

31:56.164 --> 31:57.081
at family gatherings.

31:57.665 --> 31:58.583
It wasn't me.

31:59.584 --> 32:02.378
Just like that act at the strip club
isn't you.

32:02.795 --> 32:05.965
You have no idea who I am.

32:07.091 --> 32:08.760
But I think I do.

32:14.307 --> 32:17.101
Because I was you.
And I know you need an ally.

32:18.353 --> 32:20.021
For me it was my Aunt Celia.

32:20.688 --> 32:25.526
And when she fled Venezuela,
I resented her so much for so long.

32:26.569 --> 32:29.072
Look, I understand
why it's so easy for you

32:29.155 --> 32:30.865
to pin all of your anger on Cristal.

32:35.787 --> 32:39.290
If you can't learn to forgive your sister,
you might lose her when you need her most.

32:45.380 --> 32:48.841
-So, did your 24-hour memoir do the trick?
-Not exactly.

32:49.008 --> 32:52.470
The boys club publishers
were only interested in using me

32:52.762 --> 32:55.848
to get to my father, whose naming-rights
deal I've been trying to save all night.

32:55.932 --> 32:58.851
But does Blake notice? No.
He's all Adam, all the time.

32:59.560 --> 33:02.563
-That's unfair.
-You know what the real tragedy is?

33:02.647 --> 33:05.233
This stupid cake is delicious.

33:06.234 --> 33:08.319
-[banging on microphone]
-[music stops]

33:08.403 --> 33:09.278
Thank you.

33:09.362 --> 33:14.200
Thank you. Look, I know that I have been
known to give a long-winded toast or two.

33:14.283 --> 33:15.243
[crowd laughs]

33:15.326 --> 33:16.536
But tonight I...

33:17.787 --> 33:19.455
I am-- Well, I'm speechless.

33:20.623 --> 33:24.919
What do you say to the son
you've been waiting 30 years to see again?

33:25.712 --> 33:29.966
And I knew right away it was you. I knew
because you have your mother's eyes.

33:30.967 --> 33:32.468
And my passion for work.

33:33.011 --> 33:36.097
My determination,
my unending desire for the truth.

33:37.807 --> 33:39.100
So, I wanna thank you, son,

33:40.852 --> 33:44.564
for giving me back the hope
that I lost all those years ago.

33:46.607 --> 33:47.942
Ladies and gentleman,

33:49.277 --> 33:51.529
-Adam Carrington.
-Yes. Yes.

33:54.282 --> 33:56.951
I have one final announcement.

33:57.035 --> 34:01.581
As you know, I have always wanted to work
side by side with one of my children.

34:03.583 --> 34:06.711
Well, Adam just started working
at the Atlantix today.

34:07.086 --> 34:10.922
And in true Carrington fashion,
he has already knocked it out of the park.

34:11.674 --> 34:16.721
Because of that, tomorrow,
my son will be returning with a promotion.

34:17.804 --> 34:21.184
You are our team's new head doctor.

34:21.266 --> 34:22.393
[crowd applauding]

34:30.610 --> 34:31.819
[cell phone buzzing]

34:31.902 --> 34:32.737
Excuse me.

34:41.536 --> 34:42.789
Let me call you back.

34:44.748 --> 34:46.583
[sighs] Wow.

34:47.251 --> 34:49.587
Great speech. Let me get this straight,

34:49.670 --> 34:52.422
-you're writing a book?
-Relax. I took a man's business card,

34:52.507 --> 34:55.717
-if that's what you mean.
-That book was my opportunity

34:55.802 --> 34:59.514
to tell my story. About a girl
who always dreamed of growing up

34:59.597 --> 35:02.517
to be powerful and respected
just like her father.

35:02.600 --> 35:06.854
But I've always lacked the hardware.
Nobody cares what a woman has to say

35:06.938 --> 35:09.315
as long as there's a man
willing to give his two cents.

35:09.398 --> 35:11.359
I can see that you are emotional.

35:12.360 --> 35:16.114
-But this isn't about your being a woman.
-Wow. Really?

35:16.823 --> 35:20.535
Every day I spent with you at CA
helping you build that company,

35:20.618 --> 35:24.288
and all of a sudden Adam shows up
and the prodigal son returns.

35:24.372 --> 35:27.083
-And what does Adam have to do with this?
-I have fought my entire life

35:27.166 --> 35:30.711
for the respect and the privilege
that you have given him in just 48 hours.

35:30.795 --> 35:34.048
Maybe because he wasn't given everything
you've been given your whole life.

35:34.132 --> 35:36.509
-I handed you every opportunity.
-Uh-uh.

35:36.592 --> 35:41.389
Wrong. I had to take it. Only way I got
to run CA was because I stole it from you.

35:41.472 --> 35:45.226
You didn't deserve it.
You were never qualified to run CA.

35:45.309 --> 35:48.479
Yet when the Carrington name
is dragged through the mud,

35:48.563 --> 35:50.815
or there's a scandal,
all of a sudden I am qualified.

35:50.898 --> 35:52.859
-And I am done.
-There you are.

35:54.152 --> 35:55.945
Guys from Atlantix
wanted to get a picture.

36:01.659 --> 36:02.994
He's all yours.

36:03.077 --> 36:06.289
Enjoy being the Carrington
flavor of the month, bro.

36:19.260 --> 36:20.136
[Beto] Thank you.

36:23.181 --> 36:27.059
[in Spanish] I wasn't able to hire Carlos.
I know, I know, I messed up.

36:27.143 --> 36:29.687
But I promise, if you give me
another chance, I'll find a solution.

36:29.770 --> 36:31.898
-Christy--
-Beto, I'm begging you. Please.

36:31.981 --> 36:33.858
Don't harm Blake or my family.

36:33.941 --> 36:35.860
Honestly. I can fix this.

36:35.943 --> 36:38.029
Stop. Relax. I called off the dogs.

36:39.405 --> 36:40.239
What do you mean?

36:40.323 --> 36:42.325
I'll cover for you. It's okay.

36:42.408 --> 36:46.245
I'll tell Father that Carlos had a problem
with his visa. And we'll let it go.

36:49.248 --> 36:54.086
Look, I know
I haven't been the best brother,

36:54.170 --> 36:56.464
I have my own grievances with the family.

36:57.632 --> 36:59.175
And I shouldn't blame you for them.

37:07.683 --> 37:08.893
-What's this?
-I was supposed

37:08.976 --> 37:11.312
to give you this as a threat,
if you didn't hire Carlos.

37:12.230 --> 37:13.856
But now I'm giving it to you as a warning.

37:14.273 --> 37:15.942
I'm only stalling Father.

37:31.290 --> 37:32.208
[sighs]

37:33.417 --> 37:36.337
Okay, so, that should bring us
up to speed on projects in development.

37:36.420 --> 37:39.048
-Now, I'd like to focus on--
-Sorry I'm late.

37:39.340 --> 37:42.969
-So unlike me to miss a company meeting.
-Oh, Fallon.

37:43.344 --> 37:46.347
-To what do we owe the pleasure?
-Oh. No need to be formal.

37:46.430 --> 37:47.640
We don't work together anymore.

37:47.723 --> 37:50.434
Which means you don't need to go
out of your way to humor the daughter.

37:50.726 --> 37:53.646
I learned a few things
in the last couple of days.

37:53.729 --> 37:55.439
I'd, uh, give you credit for that,

37:55.523 --> 37:59.777
but attributing a woman's enlightenment
to a man's treachery is so 1700s.

37:59.860 --> 38:01.612
-Right, Kirby?
-Mm. So archaic.

38:01.988 --> 38:03.572
Fallon, what's going on?

38:03.656 --> 38:07.118
Well, first, you tried to ignore my vision
for this book,

38:07.201 --> 38:10.788
then you lied to me to preserve
a potential relationship with my father.

38:10.871 --> 38:15.960
The irony being, I was doing this book
mostly to help him out. Well, guess what.

38:16.043 --> 38:20.548
I am sick and tired of being used
by miserably ungrateful men.

38:20.631 --> 38:23.926
I've had enough of your girly games.
I'm gonna call security.

38:24.010 --> 38:28.097
Mm. I had a feeling you weren't gonna
leave without kicking and screaming.

38:28.180 --> 38:33.394
I got tired of playing ball in a man's
world, so I bought NTNR Enterprises.

38:33.561 --> 38:37.106
The company that owns your--
Oh, well, no, my publishing house.

38:38.316 --> 38:40.401
Femperial Publishing,
as it will now be known,

38:40.484 --> 38:43.321
will focus on books
for, by and about women.

38:43.988 --> 38:47.074
Women like Kirby,
who are smart, independent,

38:47.158 --> 38:49.201
and who have been mostly ignored
until now.

38:49.285 --> 38:51.912
I'll admit, I've been guilty
of that as well. Not anymore.

38:51.996 --> 38:54.582
Kirby, you're now
my millennial content consultant.

38:55.666 --> 38:57.209
-I am?
-Mm-hm.

38:58.002 --> 38:58.961
[clearing throat]

38:59.170 --> 39:00.004
Yeah, I am.

39:02.298 --> 39:05.593
Pack your bags, boys.
Your reign has ended.

39:06.344 --> 39:07.553
[man] Come with me, gentleman.

39:12.350 --> 39:15.186
This is a joke.
Mike, Terry, don't listen to her.

39:15.269 --> 39:17.438
-[man] Time to go, sir.
-Don't touch me.

39:23.319 --> 39:24.153
[groans]

39:32.578 --> 39:33.829
[Jeff] What is all this?

39:34.330 --> 39:36.999
You got me thinking, Jeff,
and you were right.

39:37.416 --> 39:40.044
This really
wasn't a comfortable environment,

39:40.127 --> 39:41.128
so I changed it.

39:42.004 --> 39:46.008
And now Alexis has everything she loves.
Right here.

39:47.885 --> 39:49.553
Caviar? We have extra.

39:49.637 --> 39:52.181
-Her appetite ebbs and flows.
-My nurses are waiting in the hall

39:52.264 --> 39:54.809
-to help take her to my place.
-Kind of you to go through all that,

39:54.892 --> 39:58.145
but Alexis is gonna recover here
in the Carrington wing.

39:58.896 --> 40:01.399
Well,
it's her signature the hospital needs

40:01.482 --> 40:05.361
-on the discharge papers. Not yours.
-Maybe I'm misreading the situation,

40:05.444 --> 40:08.114
but I think it's you making decisions
on her behalf, not me.

40:12.910 --> 40:13.869
What's he talking about?

40:24.255 --> 40:26.799
Well, I'll be back to check on you
tomorrow.

40:28.509 --> 40:30.219
And every day after that.

40:32.888 --> 40:35.015
Be seeing you real soon, cousin.

40:38.102 --> 40:42.064
Hey, cousin? Would you bring us
a crossword when you visit tomorrow?

40:42.773 --> 40:43.607
We love them.

40:52.491 --> 40:54.743
-What's this?
-Generic white guy books

40:54.827 --> 40:56.328
already in development.

40:56.579 --> 40:59.415
You get to decide what stays
and what goes.

40:59.498 --> 41:01.876
I can find compassion
to give them a fair trial

41:01.959 --> 41:04.128
before sentencing them
to eternal damnation.

41:04.879 --> 41:05.796
[knocking on door]

41:05.880 --> 41:08.841
Miss Carrington,
there's an author here to see you.

41:08.924 --> 41:11.427
He got wind of the change in ownership
and would like to meet.

41:12.094 --> 41:15.389
Oh, he must wanna plead his case.
I have never felt more

41:15.473 --> 41:18.184
like Khaleesi than right now.
What's his name?

41:18.267 --> 41:19.310
John Southside.

41:19.393 --> 41:21.145
Ooh. Terrible pseudonym.

41:21.228 --> 41:23.564
Okay, I have five minutes. Send him in.

41:27.026 --> 41:27.860
[Liam] Fallon?

41:29.320 --> 41:30.863
What the hell is going on?

41:33.407 --> 41:34.408
Wow.

41:35.534 --> 41:38.037
[woman] We have the very best surgeons
on her team.

41:38.120 --> 41:41.207
But as you're aware,
her injuries were quite extreme.

41:41.916 --> 41:45.794
In these cases of such extensive
tissue reconstruction and repair,

41:45.878 --> 41:47.880
we like to make sure
the patient has the opportunity

41:47.963 --> 41:50.883
-to make cosmetic requests.
-Mother and I were talking.

41:50.966 --> 41:53.344
If it's possible,
she'd love to shave off a few years.

41:53.427 --> 41:55.137
We can go over the options.

41:55.221 --> 41:59.058
Well, actually, if we could use this
as a point of reference,

41:59.141 --> 42:00.559
that would be wonderful.
