WEBVTT

00:00.300 --> 00:01.934
Well, where is he?

00:01.968 --> 00:03.135
Georgie: He's in Fort McMurray.

00:03.170 --> 00:04.670
Lou: Are you going to see your brother?

00:04.737 --> 00:07.505
I don't think so. He doesn't want me.

00:07.573 --> 00:09.307
- Ty: We're not eloping.
- Lou: You're not?

00:09.342 --> 00:11.309
Amy: I was invited to lead
a horse clinic in Vegas

00:11.377 --> 00:12.410
and Ty and I thought

00:12.478 --> 00:13.445
we could make a road trip out of it.

00:13.479 --> 00:14.645
- It's not me.
- No, it's me.

00:14.713 --> 00:16.647
(Cell phone rings)

00:16.715 --> 00:18.016
Comes with the new job.

00:18.050 --> 00:19.150
<i>Lou: I told you that Georgie's birthday</i>

00:19.185 --> 00:21.619
<i>was coming up weeks ago, honey.</i>

00:21.653 --> 00:23.287
<i>Well, I'm sure you can
reschedule the appointment.</i>

00:23.321 --> 00:24.488
I just bought the McSlade farm

00:24.522 --> 00:26.357
and there's been some unexpected expenses.

00:26.391 --> 00:27.691
What does that have to do with Phoenix?

00:27.758 --> 00:30.094
That horse, he's just
too valuable to give away.

00:30.161 --> 00:32.162
I told you not to buy that feed!

00:32.197 --> 00:33.730
I take full responsibility.

00:33.798 --> 00:35.032
You went behind my back.

00:35.066 --> 00:36.800
You've destroyed everything I care about!

00:36.868 --> 00:37.834
(Tim grunts in pain)

00:37.902 --> 00:39.735
(Jack yelps in pain)

00:39.803 --> 00:41.037
Tim: That didn't need to happen, Jack.

00:44.774 --> 00:46.309
(Cell phone rings)

00:52.116 --> 00:54.150
(Papers rustle)

00:56.819 --> 00:58.387
(Phone beeps on)

00:58.454 --> 01:01.056
Hey, Rich.

01:01.124 --> 01:04.926
No, I did not get the Red
Deer venue nailed down.

01:05.895 --> 01:06.794
Why?

01:06.829 --> 01:08.430
Because somebody on your end

01:08.498 --> 01:10.499
gave the manager all the wrong info

01:10.533 --> 01:13.967
and he's already booked
those dates we wanted.

01:14.936 --> 01:19.373
(Sighs) Yes, I am going to try to fix it.

01:20.308 --> 01:21.975
Adios.

01:22.010 --> 01:23.244
(Phone beeps off)

01:23.311 --> 01:24.845

01:49.536 --> 01:51.236
Lou: There you go.

01:51.271 --> 01:53.872
Ty: Hey, Amy. So...

01:53.906 --> 01:56.775
I think we can make it
down to Vegas in two days.

01:56.809 --> 01:58.777
Then we can spend overnight in Idaho Falls,

01:58.844 --> 02:00.711
and then go back up through these roads... 

02:00.779 --> 02:02.646
Amy: Ty...

02:02.714 --> 02:04.315
I can't focus on this Vegas clinic

02:04.383 --> 02:07.385
with the whole Phoenix thing going on.

02:07.419 --> 02:08.752
Georgie: What Phoenix thing?

02:08.820 --> 02:11.556
Amy: Um, the loading
Phoenix in the trailer thing.

02:11.590 --> 02:12.723
We gotta go soon.

02:12.757 --> 02:14.758
And I have to ask you about your birthday.

02:14.793 --> 02:16.726
Did you want to invite
any friends from school?

02:16.760 --> 02:18.295
Georgie: Mmm... nah.

02:18.329 --> 02:21.631
Just you guys, but... can I have sparklers?

02:21.665 --> 02:24.167
I've always wanted
sparklers on my birthday.

02:24.202 --> 02:25.535
Sparklers? You got it.

02:25.570 --> 02:26.636
Amy: Go load your horse.

02:26.670 --> 02:27.904
Okay.

02:29.840 --> 02:30.907
(Amy sighs)

02:38.415 --> 02:39.381
(Sighs)

02:39.416 --> 02:41.250
<i>Georgie: (Panting, excited)</i>

02:41.284 --> 02:42.851
Jack! You're back!

02:44.121 --> 02:45.154
How was your trip?

02:45.188 --> 02:46.622
Amy and I are going to the arena.

02:46.656 --> 02:48.656
Can you help me load Phoenix?

02:49.592 --> 02:52.227
Sure. I can absolutely help you do that.

02:52.261 --> 02:54.996
<i>Georgie: I'll get him!</i>

02:55.030 --> 02:56.564
Ty: I got ten days off.

02:56.599 --> 03:00.168
We can take the back roads,
see lots of countryside,

03:00.202 --> 03:02.270
spend some time together, alone.

03:02.304 --> 03:04.638
It sounds amazing.

03:04.672 --> 03:07.508
Amy, the Phoenix situation
will work itself out.

03:07.542 --> 03:09.042
Eric's a reasonable guy.

03:09.110 --> 03:10.944
I hope so.

03:10.978 --> 03:12.613
Come on, get excited!

03:12.647 --> 03:14.448
I will! I will!

03:18.786 --> 03:20.553
(Truck rumbles up)

03:26.193 --> 03:27.092
Can I help you?

03:27.161 --> 03:28.461
Jeff: Hey.

03:29.429 --> 03:31.564
I'm looking for Georgina Crawley.

03:32.499 --> 03:34.033
<i>Is she here?</i>

03:38.604 --> 03:39.771

Jeff: Well, I had to come to
Calgary for this training course,

04:34.557 --> 04:37.826
so I thought I'd drop by
and surprise my little sister

04:37.893 --> 04:40.027
'cause it's her birthday today, right?

04:40.095 --> 04:40.891
No!

04:40.895 --> 04:43.072
Lou: It's the day after
tomorrow. We're planning a party.

04:43.198 --> 04:45.099
You're gonna be there, right?

04:45.133 --> 04:46.267
Uh, yeah, yeah.

04:46.301 --> 04:48.302
I don't have to be back at work right away.

04:48.337 --> 04:49.737
I got a few days off.

04:49.771 --> 04:51.372
You have to be here for my birthday.

04:51.406 --> 04:52.607
<i>Jack: Of course he will.</i>

04:52.641 --> 04:53.641
Where do you wanna sleep?

04:53.709 --> 04:55.375
In a cabin down at Lou's dude ranch

04:55.409 --> 04:57.009
or the loft in the barn?

04:57.077 --> 04:58.778
Oh, the barn's fine.

04:58.812 --> 05:00.813
I'll be closer to The Squirt that way.

05:00.881 --> 05:02.849
(Telephone rings)

05:04.252 --> 05:04.884
(Phone beeps on)

05:04.952 --> 05:06.486
Hello?

05:06.520 --> 05:08.488
Yes, Mr. Williams.

05:08.556 --> 05:09.856
<i>Eric, hi.</i>

05:10.824 --> 05:12.157
I left you a couple messages.

05:12.191 --> 05:15.427
I wasn't sure if you were out of town.

05:15.462 --> 05:19.265
Yes, I would love to talk. We need to talk.

05:19.299 --> 05:20.566
Look, Lou, I already told you.

05:20.600 --> 05:22.701
Phoenix has amazing potential as a jumper.

05:22.736 --> 05:24.703
I'm asking $40,000 for him.

05:24.738 --> 05:26.104
$40,000 dollars?!

05:26.139 --> 05:29.173
I've done my research
and that's a fair price.

05:29.207 --> 05:30.341
Look, in a perfect world,

05:30.376 --> 05:32.042
I would just give you the horse,

05:32.077 --> 05:33.177
but I can't and I'm sorry.

05:33.211 --> 05:34.178
Okay, well,

05:34.212 --> 05:35.980
let's at least negotiate here.

05:36.014 --> 05:37.348
Make me an offer.

05:37.383 --> 05:38.483
I will,

05:38.517 --> 05:39.817
but obviously I need to discuss this

05:39.851 --> 05:41.519
with my family first.

05:41.553 --> 05:43.321
No problem,

05:43.355 --> 05:46.924
but I'm gonna need a decision
sooner rather than later.

05:50.128 --> 05:52.629
Jack: $40,000 dollars?!

05:52.664 --> 05:54.999
I don't know how that's gonna happen.

05:55.033 --> 05:56.967
We're still in the hole
from Spartan's surgery,

05:57.002 --> 06:00.136
and I know you don't want to hear this,

06:00.171 --> 06:02.605
but I still intend to buy out your father.

06:02.639 --> 06:05.541
The money is way better spent on Phoenix!

06:05.575 --> 06:06.776
You and dad need to get over yourselves.

06:06.811 --> 06:10.113
Lou, imagine if we had
to cull that entire herd!

06:10.181 --> 06:13.382
But it didn't happen, grandpa!

06:13.417 --> 06:14.684
Georgie is going to be devastated

06:14.718 --> 06:16.051
if she loses that horse.

06:16.085 --> 06:17.085
I know.

06:17.120 --> 06:18.053
On her birthday.

06:18.121 --> 06:20.189
I'm sorry.

06:21.691 --> 06:23.692
So am I.

06:34.937 --> 06:35.903
Woo!

06:35.938 --> 06:37.171
(Clapping) Yeah, Georgie!

06:37.206 --> 06:39.040
Keep your heels down, honey.

06:39.074 --> 06:40.241
Wow.

06:44.279 --> 06:45.512
Amy: Nice one!

06:50.684 --> 06:51.952
Jeff: How'd she learn to ride like that?

06:52.019 --> 06:53.320
She's a bit of a natural,

06:53.354 --> 06:56.656
but Amy is really helping
her to get to the next level.

06:56.724 --> 06:58.791
You know, I barely recognized her at first,

06:58.826 --> 07:02.062
all dressed up like some rich kid.

07:02.129 --> 07:04.063
So when was the last time you saw her?

07:04.130 --> 07:05.497
Uh, I don't know.

07:05.565 --> 07:08.300
Four years ago, maybe five.

07:08.368 --> 07:11.103
Wow! No wonder you didn't recognize her.

07:12.705 --> 07:14.340
I mean, kids change a lot in that time... 

07:14.407 --> 07:15.774
Okay, just so you know, it's not my fault

07:15.842 --> 07:17.309
that I couldn't keep in touch with her

07:17.377 --> 07:19.111
when I was gone, all right?

07:19.145 --> 07:20.544
We only lived with the same family once,

07:20.579 --> 07:21.779
a long time ago,

07:21.847 --> 07:23.314
and that didn't work out for me,

07:23.382 --> 07:25.250
so they sent me to a different place.

07:25.317 --> 07:28.987
All right, not everyone
has a perfect family,

07:29.054 --> 07:31.155
not even you, I bet.

07:32.091 --> 07:33.557
<i>Georgie: Jeff!</i>

07:33.625 --> 07:34.893
Watch this!

07:37.362 --> 07:38.795
<i>Jeff: Yeah, Georgie!</i>

07:38.829 --> 07:40.163
Amy: (Clapping) Nice one!

07:40.231 --> 07:42.332
Lou: (Clapping) Good one.

07:48.907 --> 07:51.608
Hey! Where you been?

07:51.675 --> 07:54.543
Jack: Where do you think
I've been? I've got a job.

07:54.577 --> 07:55.711
Well, I've been looking for you.

07:55.745 --> 07:57.213
I wanna talk to you about our partnership.

07:57.247 --> 08:00.016
You know what, Tim?

08:00.083 --> 08:02.551
I told you already, we
don't have a partnership.

08:02.585 --> 08:03.953
Oh, we had it out, big deal.

08:03.987 --> 08:05.955
It's not the first time
and it won't be the last,

08:06.023 --> 08:07.923
so let's just put it behind us.

08:07.990 --> 08:11.259
I have no intention of
putting anything behind me.

08:11.327 --> 08:13.295
You still determined to buy my share?

08:13.329 --> 08:15.130
No, I'm not.

08:15.164 --> 08:16.764
I want you to buy my share.

08:16.832 --> 08:18.966
Well, how the hell am
I gonna do that, Jack?

08:19.000 --> 08:20.935
Jack: I don't care how you do it.

08:20.969 --> 08:23.170
I just need the money
more than I need the stress

08:23.204 --> 08:24.705
of owning a herd of cattle with you.

08:24.773 --> 08:25.973
Yeah, you're stressed, you're tired.

08:26.007 --> 08:28.142
Okay, I get it. You're
not thinking straight.

08:28.176 --> 08:30.210
When you are thinking straight,
you're gonna realize...

08:30.245 --> 08:31.879
<i>Jack: I'm thinking straight.</i>

08:31.947 --> 08:33.113
You buy me out!

08:33.148 --> 08:35.582
I told you, you and me, we're finished.

08:35.616 --> 08:37.350
Hiyah.

08:44.291 --> 08:46.526
Lou: (Gasps) Peter! Honey!

08:47.995 --> 08:48.929
You made it!

08:48.963 --> 08:50.596
Peter: Hey.

08:50.630 --> 08:52.832
Lou: Oh, I knew you would!

08:52.866 --> 08:54.500
Honey, it's Georgie's
first birthday with us

08:54.534 --> 08:55.701
and now we're all here.

08:55.735 --> 08:58.471
It's perfect! Thank you.

08:58.505 --> 09:00.005
Peter: You're welcome.

09:00.039 --> 09:01.239
Lou: You know, I think this is
the first real birthday party

09:01.274 --> 09:03.108
she's ever had.

09:03.142 --> 09:04.409
Here, let me take your coat.

09:04.444 --> 09:05.677
Peter: Okay.

09:05.711 --> 09:07.211
Lou: Oh, gosh, I have
to catch you up, honey.

09:07.245 --> 09:08.513
We have a bit of a problem... 

09:08.547 --> 09:11.850
actually, a real problem... with Phoenix.

09:11.884 --> 09:14.586
Oh, and guess who's
shown up out of the blue?

09:14.653 --> 09:16.855
- Peter: Hey... 
- Lou: Georgie's brother,

09:16.889 --> 09:19.323
and I have to be honest, I
am not too sure about the guy.

09:21.026 --> 09:23.894
<i>Anyway, I've been so busy
just getting everything ready,</i>

09:23.962 --> 09:26.396
and guess what Georgie
wants for her birthday?

09:26.430 --> 09:27.397
Sparklers.

09:27.465 --> 09:28.699
I have no idea where to get them,

09:28.766 --> 09:29.933
especially at this time of year.

09:29.968 --> 09:31.702
Honey, can you stop, please, for a second?

09:31.736 --> 09:33.937
See, this is what you do.

09:33.972 --> 09:34.972
What? What do I do?

09:35.039 --> 09:37.340
You throw yourself into
planning these crazy events

09:37.375 --> 09:39.041
and you just ignore the
issues that really matter.

09:39.109 --> 09:40.209
What're you talking about?

09:40.276 --> 09:42.111
Do you remember our last phone call at all?

09:42.145 --> 09:43.513
'Cause I do.

09:43.547 --> 09:46.081
Okay, so we argued. I'm totally over it.

09:46.116 --> 09:47.817
Yeah, but don't you realize
that all our phone calls

09:47.851 --> 09:48.885
end up as arguments?

09:48.952 --> 09:50.085
I mean, they're less conversations

09:50.120 --> 09:51.721
than they are just arguments, all right?

09:51.788 --> 09:53.422
When I'm here, everything is fine.

09:53.490 --> 09:55.123
But as soon as I go away
and we're on the phone

09:55.190 --> 09:56.791
nothing I ever say or do is right.

09:56.859 --> 09:58.159
Peter, it's not like that!

09:58.193 --> 10:00.862
It's just way harder to
communicate long distance.

10:00.930 --> 10:05.133
Peter: Right. That's my point
exactly, and I think I have a solution.

10:05.167 --> 10:08.169
I got a promotion and a raise.

10:08.237 --> 10:10.370
What?! That's fantastic!

10:10.405 --> 10:12.239
Yes, yes it is,

10:12.306 --> 10:15.576
and I think we should
buy a house in Vancouver.

10:15.644 --> 10:18.412
- In Vancouver?
- Yes.

10:18.479 --> 10:19.613
Peter...

10:19.681 --> 10:21.314
It's a buyers market out there right now,

10:21.382 --> 10:22.683
and we both know that
this long distance thing

10:22.751 --> 10:24.952
is not working, Lou...

10:25.020 --> 10:26.385
(Katie starts to cry)

10:27.354 --> 10:30.222
Okay, somebody just heard your voice.

10:30.290 --> 10:32.525
Can we go and say hi?

10:32.593 --> 10:33.760
Can we do that?

10:33.827 --> 10:35.327
(Katie continues to cry)

10:35.395 --> 10:36.829
- Yeah.
- Okay.

10:44.938 --> 10:46.438
<i>Georgie: Thanks.</i>

10:46.505 --> 10:48.006
<i>Hi. Good boy.</i>

10:48.041 --> 10:49.174
Mallory: Hey, guys.

10:49.208 --> 10:51.577
Mallory, look who's here... my brother.

10:51.611 --> 10:52.744
<i>Jeff, Mallory.</i>

10:52.779 --> 10:53.912
Hey.

10:53.980 --> 10:56.147
Mallory: Hi! You do exist. Good to know.

10:56.182 --> 10:58.115
Here, why don't you walk him in?

10:58.149 --> 11:00.117
Nah, Georgie, forget
it. (Chuckles nervously)

11:00.185 --> 11:03.788
My big brother is afraid,
can you believe it?

11:04.756 --> 11:06.791
All right. Come on, beast, move!

11:06.858 --> 11:07.792
(Phoenix whinnies shrilly)

11:07.859 --> 11:09.560
Jeez! (Georgie laughs)

11:09.595 --> 11:11.562
Amy: Why don't you just
take him inside, Georgie?

11:11.597 --> 11:13.363
Mallory: Hey, do you have
minute? I need to talk to you.

11:13.398 --> 11:14.731
- Amy: Yeah.
- Mallory: See you.

11:14.799 --> 11:16.900
Jeff: Hey, yeah, see you.

11:19.369 --> 11:21.705
Hey, what's her name again?

11:22.873 --> 11:24.273
Georgie: And this is
where I hid when I ran away

11:24.308 --> 11:26.076
from the cat pee people,

11:26.110 --> 11:29.512
and then when I phoned you I
was downstairs in the office.

11:34.117 --> 11:35.851
Jeff?

11:35.885 --> 11:36.919
Yeah?

11:36.953 --> 11:38.854
The last time I called you..

11:38.888 --> 11:41.556
you didn't seem too happy to hear from me.

11:41.591 --> 11:43.492
Wait, what're you talkin' about?

11:43.526 --> 11:46.427
Well, like you didn't want me.

11:46.461 --> 11:48.129
No, Georgie, you got it all wrong.

11:48.163 --> 11:50.932
<i>It wasn't that I didn't
want you, all right?</i>

11:50.966 --> 11:53.001
I wasn't settled.

11:53.035 --> 11:54.902
But now everything is different, all right?

11:54.937 --> 11:57.972
I have a good job and a huge condo!

11:58.007 --> 12:00.742
I mean, Fort Mac is... it's amazing.

12:00.776 --> 12:02.110
I think you'd love it there.

12:02.144 --> 12:03.844
(Knock at the door)

12:03.878 --> 12:04.845
Um...

12:04.879 --> 12:05.946
Ty: Sorry to interrupt.

12:05.980 --> 12:07.548
Lou says dinner's ready, so you know.

12:07.582 --> 12:08.616
Georgie: Oh, okay.

12:08.650 --> 12:10.651
I gotta go get changed.

12:11.853 --> 12:13.801
Hey, hey, who's uh...

12:13.805 --> 12:15.605
who's buying her the fancy riding stuff?

12:16.994 --> 12:21.194
Uh, I guess, Lou, maybe Jack.

12:21.228 --> 12:22.262
Okay, well, I'll pay 'em back.

12:22.296 --> 12:23.763
I'm good for it.

12:23.830 --> 12:26.999
Oil sands, man, sky's the limit.

12:27.934 --> 12:30.069
I mean, you wouldn't believe
how much money I'm making.

12:30.103 --> 12:31.437
- Like big money.
- Mm-hmm.

12:31.472 --> 12:33.373
Seriously big money.

12:33.440 --> 12:34.406
I mean, it's ridiculous

12:34.440 --> 12:36.808
how much I've been able to save.

12:36.842 --> 12:38.243
And now that I've done this training course

12:38.278 --> 12:39.811
I'm gonna make even more.

12:39.845 --> 12:42.214
That's great. Congratulations.

12:42.248 --> 12:43.649
So what do you do?

12:43.683 --> 12:44.883
I'm in vet school right now.

12:44.950 --> 12:47.118
I got four more years
and then I can practice.

12:47.153 --> 12:48.753
Oh, okay. So it's gonna be a few more years

12:48.821 --> 12:51.455
till you rake in the dough, huh?

12:51.490 --> 12:53.932
But, hey, everyone's got their
own different goal, right?

12:55.125 --> 12:57.528
You got a... you got a goal, Jeff?

12:57.596 --> 13:01.332
Yeah! Yeah, way more than one.

13:05.971 --> 13:08.872
Um, I got somethin' I want to say.

13:10.341 --> 13:12.976
Um, first, I want to thank
you for the great dinner

13:13.044 --> 13:15.679
and for having me here,

13:15.747 --> 13:17.815
but mostly I want to thank you guys

13:17.882 --> 13:21.518
for looking after my
sister the way that you did.

13:21.552 --> 13:22.785
<i>I um... </i>

13:22.820 --> 13:26.222
<i>I can't tell you how
grateful I am for that.</i>

13:26.289 --> 13:29.892
I guess I feel a little guilty.

13:29.927 --> 13:34.097
I know I wasn't there for
you when you needed me and...

13:34.164 --> 13:35.898
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

13:36.967 --> 13:38.201
I really am.

13:39.836 --> 13:43.539
But I came here with
a purpose, with a goal.

13:44.874 --> 13:47.109
<i>It's time for me to step up to the plate</i>

13:47.143 --> 13:49.878
and take on some responsibility.

13:51.147 --> 13:52.448
So...

13:53.350 --> 13:57.785
I'm gonna be taking Georgie
back to Fort Mac with me.

14:01.089 --> 14:04.191
I'm gonna be her legal guardian.

14:04.226 --> 14:07.027
<i>We're gonna leave right after her birthday.</i>

14:07.062 --> 14:08.630
How's that sound?

14:23.600 --> 14:25.535
<i>(Door squeaks quietly)</i>

14:31.075 --> 14:33.276
(Door squeaks quietly)

14:33.344 --> 14:34.443
Georgie: Lou?

14:36.446 --> 14:37.980
Lou: You're awake.

14:39.082 --> 14:42.283
Georgie: (Sighs) My brain won't stop.

14:51.694 --> 14:53.127
Lou: (Sighs)

14:55.831 --> 14:58.632
Georgie, what are you...

14:58.667 --> 15:01.736
what are you thinking about all of this?

15:03.405 --> 15:04.605
I don't know.

15:05.640 --> 15:07.608
I guess...

15:07.642 --> 15:10.043
I always dreamt that some day

15:10.078 --> 15:14.481
my brother would come and
get me and we'd live together.

15:14.515 --> 15:16.249
But...

15:19.319 --> 15:20.887
But what?

15:22.055 --> 15:24.123
I love it here

15:24.157 --> 15:27.826
and... I'd miss everybody.

15:30.229 --> 15:31.630
(Sighs)

15:32.499 --> 15:34.633
And Jeff, he...

15:34.667 --> 15:39.638
he really wants me to go with him,

15:39.672 --> 15:41.607
and I don't want to disappoint him.

15:41.641 --> 15:43.941
Lou: Georgie...

15:43.975 --> 15:46.677
this is your decision to make.

15:49.848 --> 15:54.886
(Tearful) It's not that
far away is it... Fort Mac?

15:55.821 --> 16:00.256
I could always come visit and...

16:00.291 --> 16:03.326
ride Phoenix, right?

16:09.667 --> 16:10.867
(Sighs heavily)

16:13.037 --> 16:14.170
(Wind whistles)

16:15.105 --> 16:16.872
Rich, it's Jack.

16:16.940 --> 16:18.173
Come on.

16:18.241 --> 16:20.810
I finally get this guy in Red Deer on board

16:20.877 --> 16:22.545
with the dates that we wanted

16:22.579 --> 16:25.614
and now you want to change 'em again.

16:25.682 --> 16:27.917
How does that make me look?

16:27.984 --> 16:28.984
(Sighs in frustration)

16:29.018 --> 16:30.953
Call me back when you get this.

16:32.187 --> 16:34.221
(Sighs, phone beeps off)

16:35.424 --> 16:36.958
Lou: Honey, we went
through the proper channels.

16:36.992 --> 16:39.060
We are Georgie's foster parents.

16:39.094 --> 16:41.195
Peter: I know, I know, Lou, I...

16:41.263 --> 16:43.064
Lou: We met with Clint.

16:43.131 --> 16:44.265
Peter: Yeah, according to him,

16:44.333 --> 16:45.834
it's well within Jeff's rights

16:45.901 --> 16:47.468
to seek guardianship of Georgie.

16:47.502 --> 16:49.703
Can you believe that? The system is insane.

16:49.771 --> 16:51.972
Lou: They say they're gonna
verify everything about his job

16:52.039 --> 16:53.206
and his living situation,

16:53.240 --> 16:56.142
but Jeff is Georgie's only living relative.

16:56.210 --> 16:58.011
He's over eighteen, he has a job,

16:58.045 --> 17:00.080
he has a place for her to live...

17:00.147 --> 17:02.683
apparently, there's nothing we can do.

17:06.118 --> 17:08.454
Did you hear what I said?

17:08.521 --> 17:09.655
Yeah, I did.

17:26.638 --> 17:29.440
Lou: There's something
I want to do for Georgie.

17:29.475 --> 17:31.610
I want to buy Phoenix for her,

17:31.644 --> 17:33.244
even if she's going back to Fort Mac.

17:33.278 --> 17:35.113
She's not, honey. She won't be going back.

17:35.147 --> 17:37.481
We'll fight it. It'll never be approved.

17:37.549 --> 17:39.850
Okay, we'll fight it.

17:40.919 --> 17:42.653
So how much is this horse?

17:42.687 --> 17:44.454
$40,000 dollars.

17:44.489 --> 17:46.123
I can probably negotiate that down,

17:46.157 --> 17:48.258
and, I mean, we have the
insurance money from the house.

17:48.326 --> 17:49.393
We don't.

17:49.460 --> 17:50.895
We don't have the insurance money, honey.

17:50.962 --> 17:52.194
It's tied up.

17:52.262 --> 17:55.364
Trust me, there's no
extra $40,000 lying around.

17:55.399 --> 17:58.568
But we have enough money
to buy a house in Vancouver?

17:58.602 --> 18:00.570
(Amused sigh)

18:00.604 --> 18:02.672
Why are you smiling?

18:02.706 --> 18:03.806
There is nothing to smile about!

18:03.841 --> 18:05.542
Peter: I'm not smiling. I'm just...

18:05.576 --> 18:06.676
sometimes I feel like

18:06.744 --> 18:08.544
you live in this fairy tale world, Lou...

18:08.578 --> 18:10.245
<i>Lou: A fairy tale world?</i>

18:10.279 --> 18:11.513
Do you think that losing Georgie

18:11.548 --> 18:14.683
is something that happens
in a fairy tale world?

18:14.717 --> 18:16.117
Do you think that when
they take her horse away

18:16.152 --> 18:19.220
it's gonna be a "happy ever after" moment?

18:19.255 --> 18:21.924
You're the one who lives in
a fairy tale world, Peter.

18:21.958 --> 18:24.158
You go to Vancouver and
you close your office door

18:24.192 --> 18:25.793
and all of this just goes away.

18:25.827 --> 18:28.362
No, it doesn't just go away, Lou...

18:28.396 --> 18:30.798
Maybe if we all lived together in Vancouver

18:30.832 --> 18:32.132
we could face the real world together!

18:32.167 --> 18:33.668
Okay, stop. Just stop right there.

18:33.702 --> 18:36.270
How can you drop that on me
in the middle of all of this?

18:36.304 --> 18:37.939
I can't...

18:37.973 --> 18:39.906
I can't move to Vancouver.

18:39.941 --> 18:41.474
Why?

18:41.542 --> 18:44.243
Because this is...

18:44.278 --> 18:45.278
this is...

18:45.312 --> 18:47.480
Home, right?

18:49.016 --> 18:51.517
It's home for you, I get it.

18:52.453 --> 18:56.521
It's just never been
home with me, you know?

18:59.059 --> 19:00.893
We don't have to deal with this now.

19:04.163 --> 19:06.131
Hey, you got a second?

19:06.165 --> 19:07.499
Can I talk to you a minute?

19:07.533 --> 19:08.734
Uh, yeah, later, man.

19:08.768 --> 19:11.169
I got stuff I gotta do
with Georgie right now.

19:17.676 --> 19:18.943
(Dog barks)

19:19.011 --> 19:21.813
<i>Georgie: Come on, Remi!</i>

19:21.880 --> 19:22.914
(Dog barks)

19:22.948 --> 19:24.115
<i>That's a good girl. Come here.</i>

19:24.149 --> 19:27.551
Good girl! Good girl! Come on, let's go!

19:27.619 --> 19:30.020
<i>Yeah, such a good girl!</i>

19:30.989 --> 19:32.756
<i>(Giggles)</i>

19:32.790 --> 19:33.924
<i>Good girl!</i>

19:33.958 --> 19:36.359
She should take that
dog with her, you know.

19:36.427 --> 19:38.528
She found her. Her name's Remi.

19:38.596 --> 19:40.597
She just loves her.

19:40.665 --> 19:43.799
Well, there's no dogs
allowed in my building.

19:43.867 --> 19:47.937
That's too bad. Georgie loves animals.

19:48.005 --> 19:49.105
(Sighs)

19:50.507 --> 19:52.074
Can I ask you something?

19:52.142 --> 19:53.609
Sure.

19:53.644 --> 19:56.612
Amy: Do you really think this
is the best thing for her?

19:56.680 --> 19:59.515
I mean, you probably work
crazy long hours, right?

19:59.582 --> 20:01.082
What's she gonna do when
she comes home from school

20:01.150 --> 20:02.083
and you're still at work?

20:02.151 --> 20:03.584
She'll be fine.

20:03.653 --> 20:05.654
You don't know that.

20:05.721 --> 20:06.988
She loves it here, Jeff.

20:07.023 --> 20:09.490
She's the one that asked
if she could live with me.

20:09.558 --> 20:12.927
That was a long time ago
when she first got here.

20:12.995 --> 20:14.529
Things have changed a lot since then.

20:14.596 --> 20:15.763
(Truck approaches)

20:15.830 --> 20:19.133
I know you love her,
but so do Lou and Peter.

20:19.200 --> 20:22.036
What, when they're not
fighting with each other?

20:22.103 --> 20:24.337
Or deciding that they're
gonna move to Vancouver?

20:24.405 --> 20:25.438
Excuse me?

20:31.279 --> 20:32.679
Hey there.

20:32.713 --> 20:33.780
Hey.

20:35.983 --> 20:37.050
So I didn't hear from you.

20:37.084 --> 20:38.685
I just wondered what your plans are.

20:38.719 --> 20:41.688
Lou: Well, we were thinking
that we could give you a deposit,

20:41.755 --> 20:43.255
say ten percent,

20:43.290 --> 20:45.658
and then pay you the
rest on a monthly basis.

20:45.693 --> 20:46.893
Would that work?

20:46.960 --> 20:48.193
Uh, no.

20:48.227 --> 20:49.561
I'm afraid I can't accept
just a down payment.

20:49.628 --> 20:52.530
Someone's willing to pay me $35,000 cash.

20:52.565 --> 20:55.033
Can you match that?

20:55.068 --> 20:57.502
No. No, we can't.

20:57.536 --> 20:59.871
Then I'm sorry,

20:59.939 --> 21:01.472
but Phoenix is coming with me.

21:04.176 --> 21:05.609
Georgie: It's not fair! He's my horse!

21:05.643 --> 21:06.811
Lou: I know, honey.

21:06.845 --> 21:09.313
And I would do anything
to keep him for you,

21:09.347 --> 21:11.115
but we just can't afford it right now,

21:11.149 --> 21:13.050
so I am going to get you another horse.

21:13.085 --> 21:14.752
I don't want another horse!

21:14.786 --> 21:18.355
I know, and I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

21:21.158 --> 21:22.458
Georgie: No!

21:22.492 --> 21:23.593
Lou: Georgie!

21:23.660 --> 21:25.628
Georgie: No! I won't let you take him!

21:25.662 --> 21:26.662
Lou: Georgie!

21:26.697 --> 21:28.798
Georgie: I won't let you take him!

21:28.833 --> 21:29.899
Amy: Georgie...

21:29.967 --> 21:31.400
Georgie: Give him to me! He's mine!

21:31.435 --> 21:33.269
Eric: Look, I'm sorry, I really am.

21:33.303 --> 21:35.004
I'm gonna find him a
really good home, okay?

21:35.039 --> 21:36.004
<i>I promise.</i>

21:36.039 --> 21:37.005
Lou: It's okay, honey.

21:37.040 --> 21:38.173
Eric: Come on.

21:43.213 --> 21:44.546
Lou: It's okay.

21:50.887 --> 21:52.053
Georgie!

21:52.087 --> 21:54.622
Georgie: (Crying) No! Come back! Please!

21:54.656 --> 21:55.990
Lou: Georgie!

21:58.260 --> 22:00.294
(Tearful) I am so sorry.

22:01.263 --> 22:02.797
How could you?!

22:02.831 --> 22:04.598
You know what? I'm glad I'm leaving!

22:04.633 --> 22:07.601
I'm glad I'm going with my brother!

22:08.535 --> 22:09.870
(Crying)

22:22.912 --> 22:24.847
<i>Georgie: (Crying)</i>

22:36.625 --> 22:37.658
Hey.

22:41.230 --> 22:45.233
So Lou went and gave away
your horse just like that, huh?

22:45.300 --> 22:46.667
(Sobs)

22:52.241 --> 22:54.274
Real nice.

22:57.078 --> 23:00.647
But, hey, it's not like you woulda...

23:00.715 --> 23:01.749
seen him that much.

23:01.816 --> 23:04.150
You're movin' anyway.

23:09.823 --> 23:12.024
Georgie: (Gasps tearfully)

23:15.662 --> 23:20.266
I'm glad that you're coming to live with me

23:20.333 --> 23:23.302
'cause I wasn't sure, you know, how...

23:23.336 --> 23:25.570
how you felt about it.

23:26.539 --> 23:28.740
You're happy, right?

23:30.543 --> 23:34.413
(Emotional) 'Cause if you're not...

23:35.347 --> 23:38.750
if you wanna stay here, that's uh...

23:38.818 --> 23:40.852
that's fine too.

23:42.054 --> 23:45.123
(Tearful) I don't wanna stay.

23:46.558 --> 23:48.927
Look, I'm gonna make it
work, Georgie, all right?

23:48.961 --> 23:52.130
It's gonna be great, I promise you. We...

23:52.164 --> 23:56.200
Look, we got a big screen TV.
The apartment's all set up.

23:56.235 --> 23:58.869
You can paint your room
any colour you want.

23:58.904 --> 24:02.172
There's a school just
down the street and...

24:02.206 --> 24:06.143
there's a rec centre
where all the kids play.

24:07.078 --> 24:09.346
We'll make it work, okay? I promise.

24:09.380 --> 24:10.848
Georgie: (Crying)

24:11.783 --> 24:13.851
Jeff: It's okay.

24:21.725 --> 24:22.859
(Door shuts)

24:27.297 --> 24:29.365
Talked to Clint.

24:29.399 --> 24:30.732
Kid checks out.

24:30.767 --> 24:31.767
Got the job he said he had,

24:31.801 --> 24:33.101
makes the money he said he did,

24:33.135 --> 24:34.436
and the apartment's real too.

24:34.471 --> 24:35.604
(Sighs)

24:36.539 --> 24:37.506
(Sighs)

24:37.540 --> 24:39.374
Eric took Phoenix.

24:40.309 --> 24:42.911
Georgie is devastated and she hates me.

24:42.946 --> 24:45.280
- She doesn't hate you.
- Yeah, she does.

24:45.314 --> 24:48.716
She does and she's going with her brother.

24:48.750 --> 24:51.151
She says she wants to...

24:52.153 --> 24:55.523
(Tearful) and who can blame her?

24:57.258 --> 24:58.826
What can I do?

24:59.761 --> 25:04.764
Uh, it's her birthday tomorrow
and she wants sparklers.

25:04.799 --> 25:08.668
I don't wanna disappoint her
anymore than I already have.

25:11.939 --> 25:14.340
I will find sparklers.

25:20.747 --> 25:23.849
<i>Georgie: Hey, Spartan. Hey, boy.</i>

25:24.818 --> 25:27.285
<i>Jack: So you're goin'.</i>

25:30.289 --> 25:31.957
You know...

25:32.025 --> 25:34.326
it feels like, you and me,

25:34.394 --> 25:38.162
we've already been down
a long road together.

25:39.097 --> 25:41.298
<i>Pretty good road, though.</i>

25:41.366 --> 25:42.934
Thing is,

25:43.002 --> 25:45.469
I don't know that I'm ready for it to end.

25:59.150 --> 26:01.018
<i>I'm sure gonna miss ya.</i>

26:01.085 --> 26:04.120
<i>Georgie: I'll miss you too.</i>

26:11.762 --> 26:13.796
You must remember them.

26:20.403 --> 26:21.837
Yeah, I was...

26:23.005 --> 26:25.674
I was ten. They uh...

26:25.741 --> 26:27.642
<i>Lou: I know.</i>

26:28.611 --> 26:30.411
Georgie told me.

26:31.346 --> 26:33.848
Listen, um, Jeff,

26:35.417 --> 26:36.885
I'm really happy that you and Georgie

26:36.919 --> 26:39.887
have found each other again,

26:39.955 --> 26:42.856
<i>but you need to know that
Peter and I and Katie... </i>

26:44.025 --> 26:45.960
we adore her,

26:45.994 --> 26:48.963
and we will do everything for her.

26:49.030 --> 26:50.564
So will I!

26:50.599 --> 26:52.299
Really?

26:52.366 --> 26:54.167
And just how do you plan on doing that?

26:54.202 --> 26:56.203
I will! I've saved up money!

26:56.270 --> 27:00.574
It takes more than money to
raise a child properly, Jeff.

27:00.608 --> 27:01.841
<i>And you need to know that we are not gonna</i>

27:01.875 --> 27:03.843
<i>just let this happen, okay?</i>

27:03.911 --> 27:06.146
Not just like that.

27:06.180 --> 27:07.914
Not without a fight.

27:11.751 --> 27:13.819
Jeff: We'll see about that.

27:17.824 --> 27:19.625
(Spartan snuffles)

27:25.265 --> 27:27.198
Amy: Good boy.

27:27.233 --> 27:30.235
<i>Hey, your leg's lookin' good!</i>

27:35.007 --> 27:37.208
Well, he's doin' real well.

27:37.243 --> 27:38.576
That's great!

27:38.611 --> 27:40.945
Amy: You heard what happened?

27:41.880 --> 27:44.781
Yeah. I'm sorry we ever
told Eric about Phoenix.

27:44.815 --> 27:46.216
And now Georgie's leaving with her brother.

27:46.251 --> 27:49.119
Everything's just gone so wrong.

27:50.054 --> 27:51.721
Amy...

27:51.756 --> 27:53.857
I think it'd be really
good for you to get away.

27:53.891 --> 27:54.858
Are you sure it's not just you

27:54.892 --> 27:56.960
who wants to get away?

27:56.994 --> 27:58.795
No.

28:03.400 --> 28:04.933
Okay, maybe.

28:05.869 --> 28:07.236
Amy, vet school's gonna take over my life

28:07.271 --> 28:09.038
after this next break.

28:09.072 --> 28:10.239
This may be our last chance to get away

28:10.274 --> 28:11.940
without any responsibility.

28:11.975 --> 28:14.310
I have responsibility here, Ty.

28:14.344 --> 28:16.511
You have to understand what
my family is going through.

28:16.579 --> 28:18.613
And I do, I do,

28:18.648 --> 28:20.682
but it's not all up to you.

28:20.716 --> 28:22.651
We gotta think about us.

28:22.685 --> 28:24.386
You have to balance these things.

28:24.420 --> 28:25.720
I can't. I can't.

28:25.754 --> 28:27.255
Look, I know you have a hard time

28:27.323 --> 28:30.525
dealing with family issues, but...

28:30.560 --> 28:32.359
No, Amy.

28:32.427 --> 28:34.828
I don't have a hard
time dealing with family,

28:37.765 --> 28:39.800
but maybe you do.

28:46.140 --> 28:48.208
(Overlapping chatter of diner customers)

28:48.275 --> 28:50.343
Oh, hey, you work here?

28:50.411 --> 28:53.145
No, I just like to wear
ugly retro waitress uniforms.

28:53.180 --> 28:54.847
It's part of my "look." (Chuckles)

28:54.881 --> 28:56.282
Can I get you anything?

28:56.350 --> 28:58.685
Uh, yeah, coffee, black, please.

28:58.719 --> 29:01.688
But, hey, look what I got
Georgie for her birthday.

29:01.755 --> 29:02.955
Is that real?

29:02.989 --> 29:04.656
Jeff: You kiddin' me? Of course it's real.

29:04.691 --> 29:06.458
Mallory: It must have cost a lot of money.

29:06.526 --> 29:09.228
Yeah, well, I make a lot of money.

29:09.295 --> 29:11.363
Nothing but the best for The Squirt.

29:11.397 --> 29:12.664
Well, it's gonna go really well

29:12.733 --> 29:15.134
with her closet full of
baggy jeans and sneakers.

29:15.202 --> 29:17.136
I'll get you that coffee.

29:19.339 --> 29:22.974
<i>Lou: (Reading aloud) "There
was a big long silence</i>

<i>Georgie.</i>

29:27.980 --> 29:30.782
Honey, I wish things could be different,

29:30.850 --> 29:32.383
you know that.

29:40.125 --> 29:41.524
Georgie: Hey, Katie.

29:43.694 --> 29:46.764
Lou: Georgie, you don't have to go.

29:46.798 --> 29:48.866
<i>We don't want you to go.</i>

29:52.136 --> 29:53.936
We love you.

29:53.971 --> 29:57.506
Georgie: (Sighs emotionally)
I think Jeff needs me.

29:58.541 --> 30:01.811
I'm all he's got.

30:01.879 --> 30:03.312
I have to go.

30:06.449 --> 30:07.783
Lou: Come here.

30:37.378 --> 30:38.979
<i>Lisa: (In letter) "Dear Jack,</i>

<i>because I miss you.</i>

(Door opens)

31:06.205 --> 31:08.673
<i>Tim: I made a decision.</i>

31:09.975 --> 31:13.211
I considered buying your half of the herd,

31:13.245 --> 31:16.347
but I'm not gonna do that.

31:16.381 --> 31:19.850
I am gonna sell big river and move,

31:21.886 --> 31:23.554
probably head up to Moose Jaw... 

31:23.588 --> 31:24.588
be close to Shane,

31:24.622 --> 31:27.123
and I can mend fences with Miranda.

31:27.158 --> 31:31.928
Fine, move away. Abandon
your daughters again.

31:31.963 --> 31:34.697
I'm not abandoning anyone, Jack.

31:37.067 --> 31:38.100
And don't bother showin' up

31:38.134 --> 31:39.602
for Georgie's birthday tomorrow.

31:39.636 --> 31:42.271
You are no longer welcome here.

31:44.908 --> 31:46.308

31:49.612 --> 31:52.013
I'm sorry you feel that way.

32:07.330 --> 32:08.898
<i>Lou: What do you mean you're not coming?</i>

32:08.965 --> 32:11.733
I've been uninvited by your grandpa Jack.

32:11.802 --> 32:14.436
Well, I'm re-inviting you.

32:17.841 --> 32:19.842
Lou, if uh...

32:19.910 --> 32:21.811
if you happen to know
anybody lookin' for a ranch,

32:21.878 --> 32:24.813
I'm puttin' Big River up for sale.

32:24.880 --> 32:26.315
What?!

32:26.382 --> 32:28.049
I think I'm gonna move to Moose Jaw.

32:28.117 --> 32:29.651
Because of grandpa?

32:29.686 --> 32:33.755
No, listen, I see it, I see it now... 

32:34.924 --> 32:36.792
how you all just put up with me,

32:36.859 --> 32:37.926
work around me.

32:37.960 --> 32:39.660
(Frustrated gasp) You know what? Stop!

32:39.728 --> 32:41.095
Just stop, dad!

32:41.163 --> 32:43.131
We're not talking about
your problems right now

32:43.199 --> 32:45.233
because we have enough problems!

32:45.267 --> 32:47.601
Okay, there's just...

32:47.636 --> 32:50.171
I'm sure you know that
Georgie is leaving tomorrow.

32:50.239 --> 32:51.272
What?

32:51.307 --> 32:52.540
So you're coming to the birthday party

32:52.607 --> 32:54.709
and I don't want to hear
anything else about it!

32:54.776 --> 32:58.078
Why? Why didn't I know about that?

32:59.314 --> 33:01.648
You see? Right there.

33:02.583 --> 33:04.751
That is what I'm talkin' about, Lou...

33:04.819 --> 33:06.887
You better be there!

(Door opens)

33:08.723 --> 33:10.757
(Frustrated sigh)

33:12.960 --> 33:15.494
He says he's moving to Moose Jaw.

33:15.528 --> 33:18.430
Peter: Huh, doesn't surprise me.

33:18.498 --> 33:21.267
He wants to be close to his son.

33:21.301 --> 33:24.370
People do that, you know.

33:24.404 --> 33:28.974
They want to be close to
their family and loved ones,

33:29.041 --> 33:30.942
which is why I brought
up the Vancouver plan.

33:30.977 --> 33:33.644
- Not now, honey.
- Well, when then?

33:33.679 --> 33:34.880
Lou, when are we gonna discuss it?

33:34.914 --> 33:37.115
Because I'd like an answer, you know.

33:37.149 --> 33:39.217
We need an answer.

33:46.657 --> 33:48.725
(Dog whimpers)

33:52.030 --> 33:55.966
<i>Amy: I guess you didn't
get my 50 odd messages?</i>

33:56.001 --> 33:58.035
Ty: I was...

33:58.069 --> 34:00.403
Ty, I'm really sorry.

34:02.806 --> 34:05.008
Look, Amy,

34:05.042 --> 34:08.277
I need you to understand somethin'.

34:08.312 --> 34:10.746
I went on a road trip on my own,

34:10.781 --> 34:13.149
and I went on a road trip with Jack,

34:13.183 --> 34:16.451
and both times I wished you were there,

34:16.485 --> 34:19.888
and this is kind of a chance for us.

34:19.922 --> 34:23.058
And I get that things
are tough right now, I do,

34:23.092 --> 34:24.293
and I get responsibility.

34:24.327 --> 34:26.061
I know you do.

34:26.094 --> 34:27.661
And I get family.

34:27.696 --> 34:29.197
I know.

34:29.232 --> 34:33.867
But you are my family and from now on...

34:36.103 --> 34:40.074
it's just the two of us
on this crazy journey.

34:41.009 --> 34:42.976
So will you start it with me?

34:43.011 --> 34:45.045
Of course I will.

35:06.099 --> 35:08.533
Mallory: Big move is coming
up. Is Georgie excited?

35:08.601 --> 35:10.102
Jeff: Actually, all the kid can talk about

35:10.136 --> 35:13.005
is how much she misses that horse of hers.

35:13.039 --> 35:14.840
Oh, and her birthday party. You coming?

35:14.907 --> 35:16.442
- Of course.
- Good.

35:16.509 --> 35:19.543
<i>Amy: Mallory, can I get a coffee?</i>

35:25.284 --> 35:27.085
What?

35:27.152 --> 35:29.854
When do you plan on taking her?

35:29.921 --> 35:33.291
Why do I feel like I'm the bad guy here?

35:35.793 --> 35:37.760
Look, I...

35:37.828 --> 35:40.530
<i>I need you to know where
I'm coming from here.</i>

35:40.598 --> 35:45.268
All right, I always wanted
to be my sister's hero.

35:46.237 --> 35:50.273
You know, come in and rescue her
from the big bad foster parents.

35:52.042 --> 35:53.842
<i>I mean, it's how I always pictured it</i>

35:53.910 --> 35:55.811
and I'm doing it!

36:05.088 --> 36:07.723
You think I'm making a mistake, don't you?

36:12.996 --> 36:14.763
(Sniffs)

36:14.831 --> 36:19.535
<i>All right, I have an idea, but... </i>

36:19.602 --> 36:21.637
I might need your help.

36:27.609 --> 36:32.012
Lou: It's because of you
that he's moving away!

36:32.079 --> 36:34.080
Why are you and dad
acting like this, grandpa,

36:34.114 --> 36:36.282
on top of everything else?!

36:36.350 --> 36:37.617
Don't you think that it's ironic

36:37.652 --> 36:39.485
that we have fought so hard for Georgie

36:39.520 --> 36:40.486
to call Heartland home

36:40.521 --> 36:43.723
and now it's falling apart?!

36:43.791 --> 36:45.691
Grandpa, I don't know
how to deal with this!

36:45.725 --> 36:47.159
Well, you've got Peter.

36:47.193 --> 36:48.961
Do I?

36:48.995 --> 36:51.463
I don't know if I do anymore.

37:01.907 --> 37:03.575
(Bucket bangs down)

37:06.545 --> 37:08.880
Jeff: Okay, I don't
have $40,000, all right,

37:08.914 --> 37:12.650
but I have $25,000 and
I have this necklace.

37:16.055 --> 37:17.087
Look, I don't want you to... 

37:17.121 --> 37:20.457
look, just listen to me, all right?

37:20.491 --> 37:22.158
Look, my sister,

37:22.193 --> 37:24.027
she's been shuttled from family to family

37:24.095 --> 37:26.096
since she was three-years-old.

37:26.130 --> 37:27.864
All right, she's never had a single thing

37:27.899 --> 37:32.502
that she could call her own
until she had this horse.

37:32.536 --> 37:36.505
She loves this horse, you gotta see that.

37:53.155 --> 37:55.389
<i>(Horse whinnies outside)</i>

37:55.424 --> 37:57.158
<i>(Hooves clatter on metal ramp)</i>

37:57.226 --> 37:59.060
(Gasps)

37:59.128 --> 38:00.294
You take him.

38:00.362 --> 38:01.896
It's just like I showed
you when we loaded him.

38:01.964 --> 38:03.698
You can do it.

38:06.300 --> 38:07.801
(Running footsteps)

38:07.836 --> 38:10.838
Georgie: What's Phoenix doing here?!

38:10.905 --> 38:13.073
He's yours.

38:13.108 --> 38:14.108
I don't get it.

38:14.142 --> 38:15.275
How am I supposed to keep a horse

38:15.343 --> 38:17.410
in a two-bedroom apartment?

38:17.445 --> 38:20.447
You won't be keeping him in Fort Mac.

38:20.515 --> 38:23.249
You'll be keeping him here...

38:23.283 --> 38:25.351
where you both belong.

38:27.655 --> 38:29.689
You mean...

38:31.759 --> 38:33.660
Are you sure?

38:34.628 --> 38:36.228
And you're not mad?

38:36.296 --> 38:38.830
No, Squirt, I'm not mad at you.

38:40.466 --> 38:41.667
Georgie: (Sighs emotionally)

38:41.701 --> 38:43.101
Jeff: Here.

38:43.169 --> 38:44.602
(Gasps excitedly)

38:48.741 --> 38:50.208
Hey.

38:50.276 --> 38:51.643
Can I stay?

38:51.711 --> 39:04.989
Of course you can.

39:05.057 --> 39:07.091
Georgie: (Gasps happily)

39:58.221 --> 40:01.156
Lou: I promise that I am gonna
take such good care of Georgie,

40:01.191 --> 40:02.124
and, you know, you're welcome to come

40:02.158 --> 40:04.460
and visit us here anytime.

40:04.494 --> 40:07.762
Jeff: Thank you. I appreciate it.

40:08.698 --> 40:10.332
Peter: Okay, I got my answer then.

40:10.366 --> 40:12.067
Lou: (Sighs) Look, Peter,

40:13.001 --> 40:15.035
we've done this before.

40:15.070 --> 40:16.870
I moved to Dubai to be part of your world

40:16.905 --> 40:19.507
and it didn't work out.

40:19.541 --> 40:21.476
We've gotta figure something else out.

40:21.510 --> 40:23.578
(Sighs)

40:26.081 --> 40:29.316
Georgie: Sparklers?! Oh my gosh, thank you!

40:29.350 --> 40:32.252
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

40:32.286 --> 40:33.453
(Sparklers crackle)

40:33.488 --> 40:35.021
Peter: Whoa! Georgie: (Giggles excitedly)

40:35.055 --> 40:36.523
Lou: Wow!

40:36.557 --> 40:38.625
All: (Laugh and giggle)

40:39.994 --> 40:41.628
Peter: Yeah!

40:41.662 --> 40:42.762
Ty and Georgie: Woo!

40:42.796 --> 40:44.864
Georgie: (Giggling excitedly)

40:45.799 --> 40:46.833
Yeah!

40:46.900 --> 40:49.335
Ty: Hey! There you go!

40:49.369 --> 40:52.005
Mallory: See, you are a hero.

40:52.039 --> 40:54.007
Are you gonna come back to visit?

40:54.074 --> 40:57.010
Yeah, you can count on it.

40:57.044 --> 40:59.545
Hey, hey, you! A-ha!

40:59.613 --> 41:03.048
Lou: Katie, look! Look at the pretty stars!

41:03.082 --> 41:05.250
Can daddy light his too? There we go.

41:05.317 --> 41:07.552
Georgie: (Giggles happily)

41:08.855 --> 41:10.388
Thank you for the sparklers!

41:10.422 --> 41:12.190
Peter: Yeah, hey, I'll tell you
what? I'll do you one better.

41:12.258 --> 41:14.126
