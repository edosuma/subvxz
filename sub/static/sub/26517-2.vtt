00:05.135 --> 00:06.745
It's already gonna have
just one parent.

00:06.789 --> 00:08.443
Yeah, okay, they'll only have
one parent, but it's a good one.

00:08.486 --> 00:09.661
You know, the first time
I saw you

00:09.705 --> 00:11.054
with Madison,
you know what I thought?

00:11.098 --> 00:12.838
This is what
he's good at!

00:12.882 --> 00:14.449
I'll give you the
money for your firm.

00:14.492 --> 00:16.625
I'll be a silent partner, and
you can control the shares.

00:16.668 --> 00:19.149
Since you started working in
that new office, you're getting

00:19.193 --> 00:21.543

use that word lightly.

00:21.586 --> 00:24.067
Let me give you the grand
tour... of the new place.Yes.

00:24.111 --> 00:26.069

those people were

Look at those sconces.

00:28.463 --> 00:29.681
Isn't this the house where

00:29.725 --> 00:31.205
all those drug dealers
were murdered?
Ooh.

00:31.248 --> 00:32.858
I live in a famous
murder house!

00:32.902 --> 00:34.512
You think I don't
have an ax?!

00:34.556 --> 00:36.514
They are gonna charge you with
attempted second degree murder.

00:36.558 --> 00:39.126
What?! No! No.
Hey, I was saving your life.

00:39.169 --> 00:42.042
I'm sending you
to county jail for six weeks.

00:42.085 --> 00:43.782
I deserve this.You have a new hearing.

00:43.826 --> 00:46.089
What? Why?Trent woke up from his coma,
and confessed to everything.

00:46.133 --> 00:47.308
You got a new
hearing tomorrow,

00:47.351 --> 00:48.700
all the charges
are going to be dismissed,

It's okay.
This is a lesson.

03:08.927 --> 03:11.278
how can I stop looking at these,

He's an elite user.

03:52.493 --> 03:53.972
He's probably...
Hey, no, no.
I'm doing it for you.

03:54.016 --> 03:56.540
What...?
There you go.

03:56.584 --> 04:00.022
I want to say "fake news,"
but it's just news.

04:00.065 --> 04:04.244
I've done all those things.
I've done such terrible things.

04:04.287 --> 04:06.246
And now everyone knows.

04:06.289 --> 04:08.248
Everyone knows that I'm garbage.

04:08.291 --> 04:12.382
The Rooftop Killer is not
garbage, 'cause she's my friend.

04:12.426 --> 04:13.775
And...

04:13.818 --> 04:15.733
yeah, she flushes her tampons,

04:15.777 --> 04:18.345
but that's, like, the worst
thing I could say about her.

04:18.388 --> 04:20.564
Thank you.

04:20.608 --> 04:22.218
And I'm sorry about the tampons.

04:22.262 --> 04:24.351
Again, I didn't know you weren't
supposed to flush them.

04:24.394 --> 04:26.178
I will wrap them in toilet paper

04:26.222 --> 04:29.312
and leave them in the trash
to smell... like you want.

04:29.356 --> 04:32.272
Well, you could also just
take out the trash?

04:32.315 --> 04:33.795
Look, this has been

04:33.838 --> 04:36.928
real fun, but we have tickets
to Hocus Pocus

04:36.972 --> 04:39.322
for the cemetery screening
tonight, remember? So...Ugh. Right.

04:39.366 --> 04:41.324
...we kind of have to get there
early to get a good spot.

04:41.368 --> 04:42.891
Yeah, but that would mean
going outside

04:42.934 --> 04:44.458
where everyone's judging me.Come on.

04:44.501 --> 04:46.329
You haven't left the house
in three days.

04:46.373 --> 04:47.983
You're going to the movie.

04:48.026 --> 04:50.290
I heard a rumor
that Kathy Najimy might come.

04:50.333 --> 04:52.596
And Kathy Najimy is
your favorite witch, right?

04:52.640 --> 04:54.337
Yeah, Kathy Najimy's
my favorite witch.

04:54.381 --> 04:56.296
I love when she rides the vacuum
like a broom.

04:56.339 --> 04:57.906
So get dressed and take a shower

04:57.949 --> 05:00.648
and meet me and your favorite
witch, Kathy Najimy, there.

05:00.691 --> 05:03.259
Just don't be a baby, okay?

05:04.652 --> 05:05.696
Mm-mm.
I want to...

05:05.740 --> 05:07.350
No. We're going
back down.

05:07.394 --> 05:08.873
No. No. No, baby.

05:11.441 --> 05:13.487
[babies cooing]Thank you for letting me join

05:13.530 --> 05:15.532
the Wee Covinas,
everyone. I mean,

05:15.576 --> 05:17.839
it's just so nice to be
around new parents.

05:17.882 --> 05:19.884
Oh, I love this group,
and we are happy

05:19.928 --> 05:22.017
to have you and
Little Rebecca with us.

05:22.060 --> 05:23.366
It's actually "Hebecca."

05:23.410 --> 05:24.585
Oh.

05:24.628 --> 05:26.195
Hebby.
[laughs]

05:26.238 --> 05:27.675
Uh-huh.

05:27.718 --> 05:30.591
Oh, that is such a cute teether
you've got-- the carrot.

05:30.634 --> 05:31.853
Oh, hey!

05:31.896 --> 05:33.420
DARRYL: Oh! Your babies
have the same teether.

05:33.463 --> 05:34.986
That's awkward.
Oh.

05:35.030 --> 05:37.467
We all have it. Don't you?
I have, like, six of them.

05:37.511 --> 05:39.382
I bought one for every bag.
She loves them.

05:39.426 --> 05:40.862
Oh, I guess I just

05:40.905 --> 05:43.386
didn't know about the carrot
teether or the fox blankie.

05:43.430 --> 05:46.084
See, with my first daughter,
my ex-- she was in charge

05:46.128 --> 05:48.304
of all the binkies and blankies
and all that stuff,

05:48.348 --> 05:50.393
and this time,
I'm flying solo, so...

05:50.437 --> 05:52.134
Okay, so, I'll need
one of those

05:52.177 --> 05:53.744
and one of those,
and, of course,

05:53.788 --> 05:55.790
one of...
I can't get one of those.

05:55.833 --> 05:57.487
[chuckles]

05:57.531 --> 05:59.402
Hebby's on formula.

05:59.446 --> 06:00.534
I read somewhere that

06:00.577 --> 06:02.492
formula's just as good, so...Yeah.

06:02.536 --> 06:03.493
It's fine.

06:03.537 --> 06:05.408
It's fine?

06:05.452 --> 06:08.933
I mean...
I'm not aiming for fine.

06:08.977 --> 06:11.109
This is my baby.
I want her to have

06:11.153 --> 06:12.633
the best.

06:12.676 --> 06:15.418
You guys are saying
that breast milk is what's best?

06:15.462 --> 06:17.464
Well, it has been shown to help

06:17.507 --> 06:19.466
with immunity and asthma
and digestion.

06:19.509 --> 06:21.555
Also with preventing
ear infections and SIDS.

06:21.598 --> 06:24.688
SIDS! SIDS is not fine, Jana.

06:24.732 --> 06:26.211
Oh, no,
what am I gonna do?

06:26.255 --> 06:28.344
I mean, I don't have boobs.
I mean, I... I do have

06:28.388 --> 06:30.520
this one shirt in my closet
that clings in a weird way,

06:30.564 --> 06:32.740
but I don't know. I mean,
I would give her breast milk

06:32.783 --> 06:35.395
if I could, but I can't. I mean,
it's not like I can just go out

06:35.438 --> 06:36.526
and buy it.Sure, you can.

06:36.570 --> 06:38.398
There is a market
for breast milk.

06:38.441 --> 06:40.530
They call it "the white market."

06:40.574 --> 06:41.618
Really?

06:46.580 --> 06:47.537
[elevator bell dings]

06:47.581 --> 06:48.930
Can I have
the Holder account?

06:48.973 --> 06:50.322
Here you go.Thank you so much.

06:50.366 --> 06:52.542
What are you doing?

06:52.586 --> 06:54.109
You haven't been
here in weeks.

06:54.152 --> 06:55.937
I took a break.
I'm starting again tomorrow.

06:55.980 --> 06:57.765
I just came
to pick up some files.

06:57.808 --> 06:59.462
Periodic reminder:
I'm your boss, okay,

06:59.506 --> 07:00.681
not the other way around.Oh.

07:00.724 --> 07:02.291
Okay, boss. Thank you

07:02.334 --> 07:04.119
for sauntering back in
after weeks of absence.

07:04.162 --> 07:07.165
Do you have any idea how empty
it is in here right now?

07:07.209 --> 07:08.428
Rebecca's been out.

07:08.471 --> 07:10.081
I didn't ask about her, okay?
I don't care.

07:10.125 --> 07:12.432
And now she has some
kind of agoraphobia.

07:12.475 --> 07:13.998
Oh, really?

07:14.042 --> 07:17.524
I mean, oh, really? Rebecca has,
uh, wacky disorders?

07:17.567 --> 07:18.525
Surprise, surprise.

07:18.568 --> 07:20.440
Hey, not done.

07:20.483 --> 07:21.658
Darryl is on
paternity leave.

07:21.702 --> 07:23.486
I haven't seen Jim
in two weeks.

07:23.530 --> 07:24.966
That is totally unexplained.

07:25.009 --> 07:28.360
And according to George, you
ran off to go death camping?

07:28.404 --> 07:30.493
Oh, that's offensive.
Don't call it that.

07:30.537 --> 07:32.103
It's called
concentration camping.

07:32.147 --> 07:34.454
Okay? It's where you go off
to focus and concentrate.

07:34.497 --> 07:36.238
It's actually very good...

07:36.281 --> 07:37.892
What's my father
doing here?

07:37.935 --> 07:39.502
And who is that guy?

07:39.546 --> 07:40.634
He's the new guy.

07:40.677 --> 07:42.549
[whispering]:
I don't trust him.

07:42.592 --> 07:45.508
He's the what?Bert, that friend
of Rebecca's

07:45.552 --> 07:47.945
who gave her the money
to buy out the firm.

07:47.989 --> 07:49.338
Oh.
Our silent partner.

07:49.381 --> 07:50.992
He doesn't look
very silent.

07:51.035 --> 07:52.472
He's talking
to my father.

07:52.515 --> 07:54.648
I didn't do that
until I was 11.

07:54.691 --> 07:56.693
[clears throat]

07:56.737 --> 07:58.869
No. Hey, I just, I...

08:02.046 --> 08:04.527
Well, look who finally
showed up to work...

08:04.571 --> 08:08.052
dressed like an
Idaho tourist.

08:08.096 --> 08:09.227
Hello, Nathaniel, Jr.

08:09.271 --> 08:10.533
Dad, what are you doing here?

08:10.577 --> 08:12.622
I can answer that.
A few days ago,

08:12.666 --> 08:14.537
Mr. Plimpton stopped by
the office unannounced,

08:14.581 --> 08:17.018
and the only attorney
here was Tim,

08:17.061 --> 08:19.411
who was napping
on the conference room table,

08:19.455 --> 08:22.893
so Mr. Plimpton called me
and asked if I'd lend a hand.

08:22.937 --> 08:24.721
Luckily, Bert
was available.

08:24.765 --> 08:28.203
I'm sorry.
Are you even a real lawyer?

08:28.246 --> 08:29.247
Indeed I am.

08:29.291 --> 08:30.466
In addition
to my degrees

08:30.510 --> 08:32.120
in hydro engineering
and ceramics,

08:32.163 --> 08:33.556
I also have a B.A.,

08:33.600 --> 08:38.213
two PhDs, an MD, a JD,
and I'm down with OPP.

08:38.256 --> 08:40.389
I add that just to make it fun.

08:40.432 --> 08:43.044
Hmm. Dad, I took a break,

08:43.087 --> 08:45.568
as men in power sometimes
need to do,

08:45.612 --> 08:47.004
but I'm back now,

08:47.048 --> 08:48.397
and I'm gonna get this place
into shape.

08:48.440 --> 08:49.572
We don't need this guy.

08:49.616 --> 08:51.226
I say you do.

08:51.269 --> 08:53.620
And since Bunch, Whitefeather,
Plimpton, Plimpton & Plimpton

08:53.663 --> 08:56.536
is still a subsidiary of
Plimpton International,

08:56.579 --> 08:59.626
I'm still the boss,
and what I say goes.

08:59.669 --> 09:01.062
BERT:
Oh.

09:01.105 --> 09:03.673
I am sensing some father-son
tension right now,

09:03.717 --> 09:05.370
so I'd be happy to bow out.

09:05.414 --> 09:06.720
Great. Bow out. Bye-bye.

09:06.763 --> 09:08.199
Okay, bye-bye.

09:08.243 --> 09:09.592
No, we need him.

09:09.636 --> 09:11.638
We need someone to
run a law office,

09:11.681 --> 09:13.509
and you're having some
sort of nervous breakdown.

09:13.553 --> 09:17.339
So Bert is in charge,
and that's that.

09:22.779 --> 09:26.566
Okay. Okay.

09:26.609 --> 09:28.655
You can do this.
You can do this.

09:28.698 --> 09:30.657
Yeah.[phone chimes]

09:32.223 --> 09:34.661
[gasps]
What?

09:34.704 --> 09:36.532
No!

09:36.576 --> 09:39.535
Hi, Rebecca.
It's Rebecca, right?

09:39.579 --> 09:41.276
Hi, Rebecca. It's me, Kathy.[Rebecca shrieks]

09:41.319 --> 09:43.278

We're doing this reading

09:43.321 --> 09:45.846
of Hocus Pocus,

you get a free witch hat.

Oh. Heather wants me to tell you

09:51.112 --> 09:53.505
to stop flushing your tampons.

09:53.549 --> 09:55.420
Heather, everybody flushes
their tampons.

and come to you?

I think I can do that.

12:40.585 --> 12:41.848
I can try to do that. Yeah.

the tools for this.

How'd that get there?

13:11.051 --> 13:13.357
HEATHER:
Anyways, you were saying,

13:13.401 --> 13:15.142
your favorite part
of the movie was...?

13:15.185 --> 13:16.970
Oh. My favorite part...Mm-hmm.

13:17.013 --> 13:20.147
...was when she sat on the
vacuum like a broom. [chuckles]

13:20.190 --> 13:22.584
That's a really boring choice.

13:22.627 --> 13:24.455
That's everyone's favorite part.

13:24.499 --> 13:26.196
[door opens]REBECCA: Guys,

13:26.240 --> 13:27.850
okay, the weirdest thing

13:27.894 --> 13:28.982
just happened.Weirder than

13:29.025 --> 13:30.810
Hector's hot takes
on Hocus Pocus?

13:30.853 --> 13:32.594
Oh, Hector,
I'm sorry

13:32.637 --> 13:34.422
I missed Hocus Pocus.I was
masturbating for six hours.

13:34.465 --> 13:35.945
I heard.Okay. So,

13:35.989 --> 13:37.947
this book about the Covinas
just fell off the bookshelf,

13:37.991 --> 13:40.341
by itself,
and it opened to a chapter

13:40.384 --> 13:41.908
about this house.

13:41.951 --> 13:44.214
Yeah, it's really freaky.
Move over.

13:44.258 --> 13:45.825
You're coming--
oh, you're coming in with us.Oh.

13:45.868 --> 13:46.869
Yeah.
Okay. [grunts]I thought we...

13:46.913 --> 13:48.175
talked about this.

13:48.218 --> 13:50.003
Okay. Okay.

13:50.046 --> 13:51.700
[shuddering exhale]
All right.

13:51.743 --> 13:54.703
"In 2015, a drug deal gone bad
led to a shoot-out

13:54.746 --> 13:56.792
"in a small ranch house
in West Covina.

13:56.836 --> 13:58.925
"Five drug dealers were killed,
along with a young woman,

"Devon Lee,

"with no prior criminal record

Wait, this is
a murder house?

Yes, I just said-- Just shh.Yeah. What...?

14:09.718 --> 14:11.459
"Devon was shot to death

"and her intestines exploded,

14:12.939 --> 14:14.941

all over the wall."

14:14.984 --> 14:17.900
Wait, this is a
poo murder house?

14:17.944 --> 14:21.599
Wait...[eerie screeching]

14:21.643 --> 14:24.994
That-that sounded like...

14:25.038 --> 14:26.866
[shakily]:
"Devon."

14:26.909 --> 14:28.563
Right?

14:28.606 --> 14:30.957
Okay, a murder book
falls off the shelf

14:31.000 --> 14:32.959
and the house creaks out a name?

14:33.002 --> 14:35.744
It's what I suspected.
It's why I came in here.

14:35.787 --> 14:37.137
We have a ghost.

14:37.180 --> 14:39.182
Oh...Okay, that's it.
I'm out of here.

14:39.226 --> 14:41.097
What? No.
Guys, calm down.

14:41.141 --> 14:43.404
I'm sure there's
a logical explanation.

14:43.447 --> 14:44.405
HECTOR:
Don't care.

14:44.448 --> 14:45.406
I'm out of here.

14:45.449 --> 14:46.929
Rebecca, are you with me?

14:46.973 --> 14:48.104
Wh...?

14:48.148 --> 14:51.151
Oh, actually, no,
um, he has a point.

14:51.194 --> 14:54.502
Because in case there is
a ghost, we should go

14:54.545 --> 14:56.765
to a diner and
get fries, right?

14:56.808 --> 14:58.506
I mean, I-I--
I mean, I'm scared.

14:58.549 --> 14:59.942
I'm so, so scared.

14:59.986 --> 15:03.859
So, let's get out of
the house, Rebecca.

15:03.903 --> 15:04.860
Get out of the house?

15:04.904 --> 15:06.427
Are you crazy?

15:06.470 --> 15:08.646
I can't leave.

15:08.690 --> 15:09.909
Devon needs me.

15:09.952 --> 15:11.606
No.

15:19.048 --> 15:21.050
So then the book opened
right to this page.

15:21.094 --> 15:22.399
[gasps]

15:22.443 --> 15:24.967
I mean, that's a message
from beyond, right?

15:25.011 --> 15:25.968
That isweird.

15:26.012 --> 15:27.056
Beyond weird.

15:27.100 --> 15:28.623
HEATHER: Valencia,
don't encourage her.

15:28.666 --> 15:29.972
She just doesn't want
to leave the house.

15:30.016 --> 15:31.582
I'm telling you,
whatever it is,

15:31.626 --> 15:33.019
there's a logical explanation.

15:33.062 --> 15:34.977
And the only reason
you think there's a ghost

15:35.021 --> 15:36.022
or whatever
is because

15:36.065 --> 15:37.284
it's Halloween right now.

15:37.327 --> 15:38.633
I mean, if it was Thanksgiving,

15:38.676 --> 15:41.766
you would think
there was a turkey in here.

15:41.810 --> 15:43.768
So, Valencia,
that's why I reached out to you.

15:43.812 --> 15:46.075
Because, unlike her,
you get that there are, like...

15:46.119 --> 15:48.034
[inhales]
other dimensions, you know?

15:48.077 --> 15:49.687
Oh, yeah, honey.
You don't have to sell me.

15:49.731 --> 15:52.516
I don't know if you know this,
but ghosts are obsessed with me.

15:52.560 --> 15:53.953
Really?In high school,

15:53.996 --> 15:55.998
I was haunted by John Candy,
like, constantly.

15:56.042 --> 15:58.653
I had to look up John Candy.
Had no idea who he was.

15:58.696 --> 16:00.655
Yep, yep, you get ghosts.

16:00.698 --> 16:02.091
Mm-hmm.So,

16:02.135 --> 16:04.441
I think that Devon is trying
to communicate with me.

16:04.485 --> 16:06.791
Mm. What do we know about her?

16:06.835 --> 16:09.533
I'm so glad you asked.
I did a bunch of research and...Just like I did

16:09.577 --> 16:11.535
on John Candy.
His last meal was lasagna.

16:11.579 --> 16:13.624
One of the reasons
I eat low-carb.

16:13.668 --> 16:15.583
Yeah, so I found
Devon's old Facebook page.

16:15.626 --> 16:18.586
Mm-hmm.And it turns out that
the meth buying here,

16:18.629 --> 16:20.849
it was just this
one random, shameful

16:20.892 --> 16:22.024
moment of weakness for her.

16:22.068 --> 16:23.373
She was otherwise
a great student

16:23.417 --> 16:25.027
and a great person.
I mean, she was studying

16:25.071 --> 16:27.682
sports medicine,
she loved baby sloths,

16:27.725 --> 16:29.466
she was totally against Prop 8.

16:29.510 --> 16:31.991
But now she's just remembered
for this one bad decision

16:32.034 --> 16:33.470
and the humiliating way
she died.

16:33.514 --> 16:34.689
You know,

16:34.732 --> 16:36.343
the poopy thing.
[sighs]

16:36.386 --> 16:38.040
So, how do we find out
what she wants?

16:38.084 --> 16:39.433
How can we reach out to her?

16:39.476 --> 16:42.349
Well, we summon her,
with a séance.

16:42.392 --> 16:44.046
A séance.

16:44.090 --> 16:45.830
Ooh, that sounds great.

16:45.874 --> 16:47.789
Thank you.Ooh, we need, like,

16:47.832 --> 16:50.052
the four corners of all
the elements, like The Craft.Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

16:50.096 --> 16:52.098
Right? So we'll get Paula here
and Heather here.

16:52.141 --> 16:54.883
And, together,
we'll summon the netherworld.

16:54.926 --> 16:56.798
Wait, what's going on?

16:56.841 --> 16:59.061
I'm a woman of science,
not séance.

16:59.105 --> 17:00.932
Maybe Heather's right.
Maybe there is some sort

17:00.976 --> 17:02.760
of psychological reason
that I'm creating this ghost.

17:02.804 --> 17:03.805
[phone chimes]

17:07.069 --> 17:09.158
No, I definitely have a ghost.

17:09.202 --> 17:10.159
Yeah.It's a ghost.

17:10.203 --> 17:11.813
You have a ghost.Yeah.

17:15.469 --> 17:16.948
MADISON:
You ready?

17:16.992 --> 17:18.298
Yeah, come on out.

17:18.341 --> 17:21.388
Oh, ho, ho! Wow!

17:21.431 --> 17:23.564
Oh, look at that.

17:23.607 --> 17:26.001
Snailor Swift looks even better
than my sketches!

17:26.045 --> 17:28.090
It's dope, Dad.
Thank you.Mm-hmm.

17:28.134 --> 17:30.136
No one's gonna
have this costume.

17:30.179 --> 17:33.182
Last year, a girl
came as Katy Bear-y.

17:33.226 --> 17:35.184
Her costume was
Janktown, USA.

17:35.228 --> 17:36.794
[chuckles][knocking]

17:36.838 --> 17:38.840
Oh. That must be Mom.

17:40.755 --> 17:41.712
Hey.

17:41.756 --> 17:43.192
Hi.

17:43.236 --> 17:44.541
So cute!And you're dressed

17:44.585 --> 17:46.152
as a sexy...

17:46.195 --> 17:47.501
Yep. I put it all on at once.

17:47.544 --> 17:48.763
All the sexy things.

17:48.806 --> 17:50.156
Guh-ross.Hey.

17:50.199 --> 17:52.114
Let's go. We're meeting
your friends at my house.

17:52.158 --> 17:53.507
I'll have her back
later tonight.

17:53.550 --> 17:54.943
Just got to see
if I can round up

17:54.986 --> 17:56.336
some divorced dads
in this outfit.

17:56.379 --> 17:58.164
Brittany's dad is available.

17:58.207 --> 17:59.426
I mean, they're not split up,

17:59.469 --> 18:01.602
but, um,
the writing's on the wall.

18:01.645 --> 18:03.038
Good intel.

18:03.082 --> 18:05.040
You sure you don't
want to come, Darryl?

18:05.084 --> 18:07.086
I mean... [chuckles]
what are you doing tonight?

18:07.129 --> 18:09.653
Nothing special.
Just a little online shopping.

18:09.697 --> 18:11.916
Nothing weird.

18:14.571 --> 18:16.225
[elevator bell dings]

18:16.269 --> 18:17.618
Good morning, sir.

18:17.661 --> 18:20.273
[sighs]

18:20.316 --> 18:22.318
[indistinct chatter]

18:23.145 --> 18:25.016
Ba-bow!Oh, come on.

18:25.060 --> 18:26.757
How you gonna get any
work done in that thing?

18:26.801 --> 18:28.150
What? You kidding me?

18:28.194 --> 18:30.196
It's all peachy.

18:34.200 --> 18:36.158
I got it.
I got it!

18:37.768 --> 18:38.943
Ooh!It's all right, it's all right.

18:39.944 --> 18:41.207
I'll just stand.

18:41.250 --> 18:43.209
I got it.

18:43.252 --> 18:45.646
So, I filed the motion on behalf
of the Sanford Multiplexes.

18:45.689 --> 18:47.082
Um, excuse me.

18:47.126 --> 18:49.215
Sanford is my client.
I can handle that.

18:49.258 --> 18:51.956
Oh, you missed two court dates,
so I stepped in to help out.

18:52.000 --> 18:54.959
Stealing my client
is not being helpful.

18:55.003 --> 18:56.135
Can you believe this guy?

18:56.178 --> 18:58.224
Yes, I do believe
Mr. Washington.

18:59.355 --> 19:00.574
He cannot
tell a lie.

19:00.617 --> 19:02.228
That's, like,
his whole deal.

19:02.271 --> 19:04.186
You guys are listening to him.
Why?

19:04.230 --> 19:06.188
Uh, your dad said
he's in charge.

19:06.232 --> 19:07.885
But not really.

19:07.929 --> 19:09.452
[Transylvanian accent]:
If he asked me to suck the blood

19:09.496 --> 19:11.193
of an innocent maiden,
I would do it.

19:11.237 --> 19:12.673
[cackling]

19:14.065 --> 19:15.023
[normal voice]:
Too much.

19:15.066 --> 19:17.156
Your dad said he's our boss now.

19:17.199 --> 19:20.246
As an officer of the Army
and a gentleman farmer,

19:20.289 --> 19:24.250
I promise to lead you
with honor and wooden teeth.

19:24.293 --> 19:25.425
This is a joke.

19:25.468 --> 19:26.861
You're a joke, Bert.

19:26.904 --> 19:27.905
Tim, come on.

19:27.949 --> 19:30.081
[grunts]

19:36.175 --> 19:37.176
MAYA:
Um,

19:37.219 --> 19:40.875
guys, does anyone know
what I am?

19:40.918 --> 19:43.182
Katy Bear-y?
[chuckles]

19:44.357 --> 19:48.578
"Roar"?
"Roar"?

19:50.319 --> 19:51.277
[typing]

19:51.320 --> 19:53.366
Holy Goddess of Milk Jugs.

19:53.409 --> 19:55.237
Oh, look at this breast milk.

19:55.281 --> 19:58.284
I mean, it's in Palmdale,
but it looks gorgeous.

19:58.327 --> 19:59.807
Never frozen, vegan,

19:59.850 --> 20:01.504
non-smoking, alcohol-free.

20:01.548 --> 20:03.245
Look.

20:03.289 --> 20:04.855
Oh, so creamy.

20:04.899 --> 20:06.335
Guh-ross.

20:06.379 --> 20:08.685
Uh, okay. I think I
fixed the baby monitor.

20:08.729 --> 20:10.165
For future reference,

20:10.209 --> 20:11.732
you just need to reset it
and sync it again.

20:11.775 --> 20:14.735
Oh, I got to get this primo
stuff before it gets snapped up.

20:14.778 --> 20:17.085
Oh, what do I do about Hebby?

20:17.128 --> 20:18.652
Don't look at me.
Babies are

20:18.695 --> 20:19.914
not really my area.

20:19.957 --> 20:22.177
You do remember
why we broke up, right?

20:22.221 --> 20:24.614
Would you mind staying with her?

20:24.658 --> 20:26.268
Uh...Oh, she sleeps
like a rock.

20:26.312 --> 20:27.661
She will not wake up.

20:27.704 --> 20:29.315
Why are you freaking out
about breast milk, Darryl?

20:29.358 --> 20:31.317
I was a formula baby, and I am
the healthiest person you know.

20:31.360 --> 20:32.579
Never had a cold.

20:32.622 --> 20:34.189
Yeah, I know.
But you're kind of a robot.

20:34.233 --> 20:35.321
You're not the first person
to say that,

20:35.364 --> 20:37.279
and I take it as a compliment.

20:37.323 --> 20:39.325
Hebby doesn't have a mom.

20:39.368 --> 20:41.022
Moms are a big deal.

20:41.065 --> 20:43.198
They know
the right carrot teether to get,

20:43.242 --> 20:44.330
what's the right blanket.

20:44.373 --> 20:46.201
I went to baby group,

20:46.245 --> 20:48.421
and I brought
a Christmas blanket.

20:48.464 --> 20:50.553
I have to do this.

20:50.597 --> 20:51.772
Can you stay?

20:51.815 --> 20:53.339
Cancel your Halloween plans?

20:53.382 --> 20:55.558
Oh, you don't have to worry
about that. I hate Halloween.

20:55.602 --> 20:58.082
It's just an excuse
to sell toxic plastic costumes

20:58.126 --> 20:59.736
and death sugar candy.

21:01.521 --> 21:03.174
Go on. Go ahead.

21:03.218 --> 21:04.915
Oh, thank you.

21:04.959 --> 21:07.440
Oh, and thank you
for being the kind of person

21:07.483 --> 21:09.355
that I would hate
to hang out with on Halloween.

21:09.398 --> 21:10.573
Ah.

21:13.707 --> 21:15.970
BERT:
You know,

21:16.013 --> 21:17.276
I am finding
that I do enjoy

21:17.319 --> 21:19.103
the camaraderie
of an office.

21:19.147 --> 21:21.018
It's like the camaraderie
of my BPD group

21:21.062 --> 21:22.411
except a lot less annoying.

21:22.455 --> 21:24.587
MAYA: I really like
how you share.Look at him.

21:24.631 --> 21:26.372
Bears remind me of wolves.NATHANIEL:
Being all nice to everyone.

21:26.415 --> 21:28.461
Making them feel comfortable
in the workplace.

21:28.504 --> 21:30.332
I hate him.

21:30.376 --> 21:32.682
Yeah, I'm just gonna
stand right here.

21:32.726 --> 21:35.032
I got to get rid of this guy.
Whatever it takes.

21:35.076 --> 21:36.686
Well, how you gonna do that?

21:36.730 --> 21:39.515
Everybody's got dirt.

21:39.559 --> 21:41.561
I just got to dig it up.

21:50.178 --> 21:53.007
The candle draws out
the spirit from hiding,

21:53.050 --> 21:55.923
the clove makes it safe
for the spirit to emerge,

21:55.966 --> 21:58.969
and the crystals...
they're just pretty.

21:59.013 --> 22:00.841
Rebecca, gong it, girl.

22:00.884 --> 22:03.017
Oh. Okay.

22:03.060 --> 22:07.064
So, I mean, you know,
not to be a downer,

22:07.108 --> 22:09.153
but let's be real.

22:09.197 --> 22:10.720
This ghost business is crap,

22:10.764 --> 22:12.983
and you're just ashamed
to leave your house,

22:13.027 --> 22:15.072
and you made up a ghost
in your mind as an excuse.

22:15.116 --> 22:16.160
HEATHER:
Yeah.

22:16.204 --> 22:17.684
That sounds right.REBECCA:
Ladies,

22:17.727 --> 22:19.163
that is what I thought as well,

22:19.207 --> 22:20.904
but then I looked at the
evidence, and it's overwhelming.

22:20.948 --> 22:22.950
Eh.

22:22.993 --> 22:25.213
Uh, the book. The creaking.

22:26.910 --> 22:28.259
The book.

22:28.303 --> 22:29.913
The creaking.

22:29.957 --> 22:31.175
VALENCIA:
And if you two would please

22:31.219 --> 22:32.655
tamp down your skepticism.

22:32.699 --> 22:34.657
Devon can feel
your negative vibes.Yeah.

22:34.701 --> 22:37.181
[coughing][sneezes]

22:45.712 --> 22:47.148
Hey.

22:47.191 --> 22:48.715
Did you get the info?

22:48.758 --> 22:51.718
Yeah. I got the scoop,
the skinny,

22:51.761 --> 22:53.502
the lowdown on the shakedown.

22:53.546 --> 22:55.461
You're just a dude in a costume.

22:55.504 --> 22:56.766
[chuckles]:
Yeah.

22:56.810 --> 22:59.856
Yep. I'm the real detective.

22:59.900 --> 23:01.510
There's everything
you need to know

23:01.554 --> 23:03.120
about Bert Buttenweiser.

23:03.164 --> 23:04.644
Buttenweiser? [scoffs]

23:04.687 --> 23:05.949
I knew he was a weirdo.

23:05.993 --> 23:07.342
Yeah.

23:07.386 --> 23:09.388
So, who are you dressed as?
Anderson Cooper?

23:09.431 --> 23:10.954
No.

23:10.998 --> 23:13.217
That guy from Mad Men
who looks like Anderson Cooper.

23:13.261 --> 23:15.785
God, I despise Halloween.

23:15.829 --> 23:18.614
You're no fun. [cries mockingly]

23:21.008 --> 23:23.053
CHILDREN:
Trick or treat!

23:23.097 --> 23:25.621
WHITE JOSH: Okay, guys, if you
must eat candy, please try

23:25.665 --> 23:27.754
and limit yourselves to one
piece of dark chocolate a day.

23:27.797 --> 23:28.885
Okay? 'Cause it lowers
your cholesterol,

23:28.929 --> 23:30.583
and it prevents
certain kinds of cancer.

23:30.626 --> 23:32.498
Okay? Did you guys hear
what I said? Did you...?Oh! Excuse me.

23:32.541 --> 23:33.977
Hey, trick or treat, dude.Oh!

23:34.021 --> 23:36.458
Wow, Josh. Proud of you.

23:36.502 --> 23:38.242
You didn't dress up this year.

23:38.286 --> 23:39.983
You're a grown man.What?

23:40.027 --> 23:42.116
I'm not a grown man.
I'm a weatherman. Look.

23:42.159 --> 23:45.206
Oh."Rainy skies with a
chance of precipitation."

23:45.249 --> 23:47.251
Rain means precipitation.

23:47.295 --> 23:49.906
Thanks, vocab police.
Hey, where's Darryl?

23:49.950 --> 23:51.560
Uh, I got a baby
present for him.

23:51.604 --> 23:53.257
He had to run out,
so I'm watching Hebby,

23:53.301 --> 23:55.129
who is and will stay asleep.

23:55.172 --> 23:56.870
Cool. Uh, can we wake her up?

23:56.913 --> 23:58.262
No.

23:58.306 --> 24:00.264
Please? I saw this cute
little koala costume,

24:00.308 --> 24:02.353
and I was like,
"Who can I buy this for?"

24:02.397 --> 24:04.834
And then I was like,
"My ex-fiancée's baby

24:04.878 --> 24:06.793
that she had with her boss
might need a costume."

24:06.836 --> 24:08.098
Hmm.So I bought it.

24:08.142 --> 24:10.231
I know you hate Halloween,
but I love it.

24:10.274 --> 24:12.363
Come on! Wake her up,
wake her up, wake her up!

24:12.407 --> 24:13.800
No.[Hebecca crying]

24:13.843 --> 24:15.932
Great. You woke her up.Yes!

24:15.976 --> 24:20.241
There's a storm moving in
with a 100% chance of cuteness.

24:23.244 --> 24:25.202
See the headset?
It's an earpiece.

24:25.246 --> 24:26.769
[high-pitched]:
Hi, baby.

24:26.813 --> 24:29.598
Oh, we're having
"koala-ty" time, aren't we?

24:29.642 --> 24:31.818
Who's a "wittle" baby?

24:31.861 --> 24:33.820
As much as I hate
your baby voice--

24:33.863 --> 24:35.517
and I hateit--

24:35.561 --> 24:37.780
she does look pretty cute
in this little costume.

24:37.824 --> 24:40.566
Hi. Hi.

24:40.609 --> 24:42.219
It sucks
Darryl's missing this.

24:42.263 --> 24:43.917
Yeah, where is he?

24:43.960 --> 24:45.527
Uh, that's a good question.Oh.

24:45.571 --> 24:48.051
I'll give him a call.Where's he going?

24:48.095 --> 24:49.618
[line ringing]

24:49.662 --> 24:51.402
DARRYL:
Hey.

24:51.446 --> 24:53.579
I'm so sorry I'm late.Yeah, where are you?

24:53.622 --> 24:55.450
Currently? Marina del Rey.

24:55.494 --> 24:56.495
What? You were going
to Palmdale.

24:56.538 --> 24:57.496
That's in the opposite
direction.

24:57.539 --> 24:58.497
Yeah. I went to Palmdale.

24:58.540 --> 24:59.498
I met this woman in an alley.

24:59.541 --> 25:00.673
She seemed shady.

25:00.716 --> 25:02.196
I was sure
she was selling me cow milk.

25:02.239 --> 25:06.461
And I tasted it,
and it was vanilla almond milk.

25:06.505 --> 25:08.158
Ah.So I got upset.

25:08.202 --> 25:10.030
I may have been crying. And so
then her boyfriend came out,

25:10.073 --> 25:11.988
and he had a gun,
so I panicked, and I shoved him.

25:12.032 --> 25:13.642
But it turns out it was
just his Halloween costume.

25:13.686 --> 25:15.644
He was dressed as the boyfriend
from Claws.

25:15.688 --> 25:18.429
Anyway, I got stuck there
for an hour talking to the cops,

25:18.473 --> 25:20.780
and now I am trying
to get to Playa del Rey,

25:20.823 --> 25:22.869
but there's a parade
in Marina del Rey.

25:22.912 --> 25:24.784
And I'm sitting here
looking at a float

25:24.827 --> 25:27.003
full of dancing gladiators
on surfboards.

25:27.047 --> 25:28.570
I mean, what even is that?

25:28.614 --> 25:30.920
I can't get out of this traffic,
and I'm hyperventilating.

25:30.964 --> 25:32.922
Wait a minute,
what's going on?

25:32.966 --> 25:35.664
What's happening, because...
What's going on with my baby?

25:35.708 --> 25:37.536
Nothing. Nothing. She's fine.
Everything's fine.Hmm?

25:37.579 --> 25:38.972
No, you wouldn't have called if
there wasn't something going on.

25:39.015 --> 25:40.800
Did she wake up?No, no, no. No, no, no.

25:40.843 --> 25:42.279
DARRYL:
What am I missing? Oh!She's asleep.

25:42.323 --> 25:44.499
She's not here...
being cute or anything.

25:44.543 --> 25:46.109
You just get back here
as soon as you can, okay?

25:46.153 --> 25:48.024
All right. Bye-bye.

25:48.068 --> 25:49.983
Yeah, parents are nuts.

25:52.072 --> 25:55.554
In light and love,
we call upon the four corners

25:55.597 --> 25:57.599
to open the channel
of communication

25:57.643 --> 25:59.035
between our two worlds

25:59.079 --> 26:02.909
and help us make contact
with any earthbound spirits.

26:02.952 --> 26:05.825
Let's all hold hands.

26:05.868 --> 26:07.609
Do it.[groans]

26:09.263 --> 26:12.005
Devon, we're here.

26:12.048 --> 26:15.008
Send us a message
however you can.

26:15.051 --> 26:16.226
Text is probably easiest for me.

26:16.270 --> 26:18.098

[all gasp]Look.

26:31.764 --> 26:34.680
Okay, that...
This has to be an earthquake.

26:34.723 --> 26:37.813
That's not an earthquake.

26:50.826 --> 26:52.480

26:52.523 --> 26:55.657
The occult is real.

26:55.701 --> 26:58.573
Okay, I'm slightly freaked out.

26:58.617 --> 27:00.270
Um, I-I thought this
was gonna be boring,

27:00.314 --> 27:01.837
but you know what?

27:01.881 --> 27:03.491
[laughs]

27:03.534 --> 27:07.147
Best Halloween ever!

27:07.190 --> 27:08.931
Oh, Valencia.

27:08.975 --> 27:12.369
Come on,
these are great illusions.

27:12.413 --> 27:15.938
You're like David Copperfield
without the assault allegations.

27:15.982 --> 27:17.244
Um, wait, you guys?

27:17.287 --> 27:19.681
I didn't do anything. Nothing.

27:19.725 --> 27:21.944
That was not me.
Oh, my God.

27:21.988 --> 27:23.598
I am so scared.

27:23.642 --> 27:25.121
I actually didn't think
this junk would work,

27:25.165 --> 27:26.949
but it did, and now I opened
the doorway to the occult.

27:26.993 --> 27:28.908
Lord Jesus,

27:28.951 --> 27:31.127
please forgive me. I just
wanted to be like Gwyneth.

27:31.171 --> 27:32.912
Okay, um, I don't know
what's happening,

27:32.955 --> 27:35.784
but I don't like it,
so, um, I am leaving.

27:35.828 --> 27:38.047
No, no. Wait, wait.
Valencia, you swear

27:38.091 --> 27:40.397
that you did not
rig this table

27:40.441 --> 27:42.269
or do anything
with the lights?

27:42.312 --> 27:44.271
Hail Mary, full of grace.
The Lord is with thee.

27:44.314 --> 27:45.620
Blessed art thou
amongst women.

27:45.664 --> 27:47.883
Yeah, I might leave.Yeah, let's go.

27:47.927 --> 27:50.581
No, no, don't leave.
Do you realize what's happening?

27:50.625 --> 27:53.019
This is the moment. Devon is
trying to communicate with us.

27:53.062 --> 27:54.629
Everyone. Everyone.[Valencia groans]

27:54.673 --> 27:57.501
We're listening.

27:57.545 --> 27:59.895
What do you want, Devon?
Send us a message.

27:59.939 --> 28:01.941
Everyone, shh, shh, shh.

28:01.984 --> 28:03.420
WHITE JOSH:
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

28:03.464 --> 28:04.726
Shh, shh, shh, shh.DARRYL:
Joshua?

28:04.770 --> 28:07.511
Look! Look how much milk I got.She's asleep.

28:07.555 --> 28:10.253
And she was not dressed
like a koala earlier.

28:10.297 --> 28:12.212
Eureka! Liquid gold.

28:12.255 --> 28:14.997
Now I got to get these in the
freezer or they'll go bad. Wait.

28:16.042 --> 28:18.174
Why is it so dark in here?

28:18.218 --> 28:20.524
Oh, why do you have
that lantern on?

28:20.568 --> 28:22.701
Darryl, what
are you doing?

28:22.744 --> 28:23.832
The power's out in
the freezer, too.

28:23.876 --> 28:25.747
But it's insulated,
and it'll keep it cold

28:25.791 --> 28:26.835
for a couple hours

28:26.879 --> 28:29.403
until I can get out
and buy a generator.

28:29.446 --> 28:31.057
Why is there
so much damn food

28:31.100 --> 28:32.972
in this freezer?
And it's filthy.

28:33.015 --> 28:35.061
What animal lives like this?

28:35.104 --> 28:36.845
Is this a good time to talk
about your eating habits?

28:36.889 --> 28:39.413
Are you familiar with the
phrase, "shop the perimeter"?

28:39.456 --> 28:41.850
Don't yell at me. Help me.

28:41.894 --> 28:44.200
Don't make me touch
the milk bags.

28:49.292 --> 28:51.425
Wow, you're working late.

28:51.468 --> 28:53.775
And during a blackout.

28:53.819 --> 28:55.951
What is this
big business opportunity

28:55.995 --> 28:56.996
that you called me about?

28:57.039 --> 28:58.562
Well, I lied about that,

28:58.606 --> 29:01.914
but it is an opportunity for you
to see the truth about Bert.

29:01.957 --> 29:03.829
Oh, Nathaniel.No, I'm not letting

29:03.872 --> 29:06.527
an outsider take over a branch
of our family's firm.

29:06.570 --> 29:07.963
I hired an investigator,

29:08.007 --> 29:11.619
and Bert is in no way qualified
to be running this place

29:11.662 --> 29:13.142
or even working here.

29:13.186 --> 29:14.753
Look. It's all in the file.

29:14.796 --> 29:16.232
[sighs]

29:17.277 --> 29:20.628
Oh, yeah. Yep. I know all that.

29:21.760 --> 29:24.806
You... you know
about the mental illness?

29:24.850 --> 29:27.374
The fact that he's
never practiced law?

29:27.417 --> 29:29.245
I mean,
he's a conspiracy theorist.

29:29.289 --> 29:31.857
I mean, the-the man
once lived in a sewer.

29:31.900 --> 29:32.988
You mean Long Beach?No.

29:33.032 --> 29:35.686
I mean an actual sewer.

29:35.730 --> 29:38.602
I don't care about him.
I care about you.

29:38.646 --> 29:40.387
You're a screwup who's
in love with a lunatic

29:40.430 --> 29:42.128
who pushed a man off the roof.

29:43.259 --> 29:44.608
I read the Daily Covina.

29:45.653 --> 29:47.176
I comment sometimes, too.

29:47.220 --> 29:49.875
I don't know who
you are anymore.

29:49.918 --> 29:51.659
That's why I called
that wacko Bert in,

29:51.702 --> 29:53.226
to see if it would wake you up.

29:53.269 --> 29:54.880
I-I'm... Wait.And it did.

29:54.923 --> 29:58.100
I'm sorry, you...

29:58.144 --> 30:00.146
you care about me?

30:00.189 --> 30:03.236
Man, I really did a number
on you, didn't I?

30:03.279 --> 30:05.238
Son, what I care about

30:05.281 --> 30:08.197
is the firm.
That's what matters.

30:10.330 --> 30:12.375
Devon. Devon.

30:12.419 --> 30:14.595
Okay, come back.
Please come back.

30:14.638 --> 30:16.597
Give us another sign.
Tell us what you need.

30:16.640 --> 30:18.425
Why have you contacted us?

30:18.468 --> 30:20.035
This is a safe space.

30:21.297 --> 30:23.256

30:23.299 --> 30:25.258

30:30.916 --> 30:32.134
What?

30:32.178 --> 30:33.919

at her Facebook page.

30:33.962 --> 30:35.094

30:35.137 --> 30:36.486
Facebook page.

30:36.530 --> 30:38.488
Yeah, but weren't you
already open to that page

30:38.532 --> 30:41.709
when the power went out?She was. She definitely was.

30:42.753 --> 30:45.017
Oh, my God, you guys.

30:45.060 --> 30:46.932
Look at this. Today's...

30:48.542 --> 30:49.760
...the anniversary
of her death.

30:49.804 --> 30:51.762
Oh, please forgive me, Jesus.

30:51.806 --> 30:53.895
If you want me to become
a nun, I totally will.

30:53.939 --> 30:55.070

30:55.114 --> 30:57.072
No, no, don't...
Just stop it, Valencia.

30:57.116 --> 30:58.987
This isn't about you.
This is about her.

30:59.031 --> 31:00.293
She wants us to honor her...

31:00.336 --> 31:02.512
somehow.

31:02.556 --> 31:05.385
I don't know, bring her
flowers or something.

31:05.428 --> 31:07.126
Yeah, she wants us
to bring her flowers.

31:07.169 --> 31:08.736

she wants us to bring her
some period panties.

some flowers and free
a ghost from purgatory.

Oh. Let's go.

31:18.702 --> 31:21.531

And the car.

Okay.

31:31.193 --> 31:33.935
Well, thanks for not making
me touch the milk bags.

Hey.

Oh, thank goodness.

31:38.505 --> 31:39.810
All this milk will be safe now.

31:39.854 --> 31:41.073
That is a ton of milk.

31:41.116 --> 31:43.118
You're good for
what, six months?

31:43.162 --> 31:44.511
No, that's a week.

31:44.554 --> 31:46.295
Then I got to get out there
and do it again.

31:46.339 --> 31:47.122
You're kidding me.

Uh, this happened.

32:00.309 --> 32:01.310
with black market
breast milk,

32:01.354 --> 32:02.355
and then he missed
his daughter's

32:02.398 --> 32:03.834
first Halloween dressed
as a koala.

32:03.878 --> 32:06.098
What? You said, specifically,
that she was not a koala.

32:06.141 --> 32:08.056
Oh, great. No, that's great.
I missed that?

32:08.100 --> 32:09.536
Did you take a picture?

32:09.579 --> 32:11.799
Yeah, I took about four.
Josh took 78, mostly selfies,

32:11.842 --> 32:13.322
but don't worry,
she's in some of them.

32:13.366 --> 32:16.282
I can't believe I missed that.

32:16.325 --> 32:17.936
I mean... [sighs]

32:17.979 --> 32:20.112
I just wanted to make sure she
had every advantage, you know?

32:20.155 --> 32:21.940
That's all I was doing it for.

32:21.983 --> 32:24.203
I mean, I don't have boobs,
you did.

32:24.246 --> 32:25.813
You breastfed.

32:25.856 --> 32:28.990
Madison's so smart
and she has no allergies, and...

32:29.034 --> 32:30.949
I don't know, maybe that's why.

32:30.992 --> 32:32.254
Maybe.

32:32.298 --> 32:34.474
Or maybe it's because
we're good parents.

32:34.517 --> 32:36.998
Also, I don't know what
I told you at the time,

32:37.042 --> 32:39.305
but I only breastfed
for, like, ten days.

32:39.348 --> 32:41.307
My nipples were like raw steak.

32:41.350 --> 32:42.569

Thank you, Madison.

Darryl, your daughter
with the weird name

32:45.876 --> 32:48.575
does not need breast milk
or a mom.

32:48.618 --> 32:50.185
She needs a good parent.

32:50.229 --> 32:51.926
And she has one.

32:51.970 --> 32:54.363
So use all that
milk if you want,

32:54.407 --> 32:56.061
then just go back to formula.

I've been watching you
the whole time...

35:10.064 --> 35:12.458
...standing in an open grave,
and I think I heard

35:12.501 --> 35:15.548
someone talking about shame.

35:16.810 --> 35:18.594
Yeah, that was me.

35:18.638 --> 35:22.120

Hello, Nathaniel, Jr.
You wanted to see me?

38:25.346 --> 38:28.784
I did. I spoke to my father,
and he put meback in charge,

38:28.828 --> 38:31.439
so youcan go back to being
the silent partner.

38:31.483 --> 38:32.832
Oh, yes, I know.

38:32.875 --> 38:35.313
I got an e-mail from him
this morning to that effect.

38:35.356 --> 38:37.097
So what are you still
doing here?

38:37.140 --> 38:38.620
Oh, I like it here.
I like the people.

38:38.664 --> 38:40.318
I like the work.

38:40.361 --> 38:43.408
And it gives me something to do
besides write Internet comments.

38:43.451 --> 38:44.844
But my father relieved you
of your duties.

38:44.887 --> 38:47.499
But the thing is,
he can't do that.

38:47.542 --> 38:49.501
I control the majority
of this branch.

38:49.544 --> 38:52.721
I was only being silent because
I was being a nice guy.

38:52.765 --> 38:54.462
But I want this job,

38:54.506 --> 38:56.421
and you need me here,
I can feel it.

38:56.464 --> 38:59.685
In fact, I'm enjoying
it so much around here,

38:59.728 --> 39:01.687
I've just made a few changes.

39:01.730 --> 39:03.950
Instead of adding
my name to the branch,

39:03.993 --> 39:08.346
I've decided to rename it,
something short and catchy.

39:08.389 --> 39:10.043
What?

39:10.086 --> 39:12.828
Behold the legal collective

39:12.872 --> 39:14.613

Don't worry, son.

39:22.795 --> 39:24.405
It still has our names
right there underneath.

39:24.449 --> 39:26.059
Don't call me son.

39:26.102 --> 39:29.062
Look, I know that me being here
is not your first choice,

39:29.105 --> 39:31.543
but you're stuck with me.

39:31.586 --> 39:34.502
Whatever. Don't get
too comfortable, Buttenweiser.

39:34.546 --> 39:37.810
Oh, I won't, not
with my fibromyalgia.

Mm-hmm.
[whimpers]

39:48.821 --> 39:51.345
There's gonna be a lot of people
in there judging me.

39:51.389 --> 39:52.912
It's gonna be fine.

39:52.955 --> 39:55.567
I promise.
Mm-hmm.

39:55.610 --> 39:57.264
[exhales] Okay.

39:57.307 --> 39:58.831
Okay?
Mm-hmm.
Let's go.

39:58.874 --> 40:00.789
Okay.

40:00.833 --> 40:03.226
Excuse me?
Excuse me, miss.

40:03.270 --> 40:05.054
I dressed as you
last night.

40:05.098 --> 40:06.447
The Rooftop Killer.

40:06.491 --> 40:09.058
Can I have a selfie
with you?

40:09.102 --> 40:10.451
Uh, sure, sure.

40:10.495 --> 40:12.714
Can you put your hands
around my neck

40:12.758 --> 40:14.847
like you're choking me?

40:14.890 --> 40:16.805
I mean, I didn't choke--
I didn't choke anyone.

40:16.849 --> 40:18.503
That's okay.
Okay.

40:18.546 --> 40:21.462
[sighs]: Okay. Ah.[camera clicks]

40:21.506 --> 40:23.856

40:25.553 --> 40:28.904
Okay, maybe they care a little
bit, but, um, it'll wear off.

40:28.948 --> 40:31.472
Yeah, at least you
didn't poopy on a wall.

40:31.516 --> 40:33.213
That's a good point.
Thank you, V.

40:33.256 --> 40:36.042
You guys, the mystery is solved.

40:36.085 --> 40:37.260
I just talked to our landlord.

40:37.304 --> 40:38.871
Turns out there's
an issue with the pipes...

40:38.914 --> 40:41.482
[gasps]
...so some major
off-gassing of steam.

40:41.526 --> 40:43.092
It knocked the books
off the shelf,

40:43.136 --> 40:44.659
then created
that awful groaning sound,

40:44.703 --> 40:46.879
shot steam up
through the floor

40:46.922 --> 40:48.620
which is what floated
the coffee table.

40:48.663 --> 40:50.665
Wh-- pipes...?

40:50.709 --> 40:52.101
Yes, it turns out
they were clogged

40:52.145 --> 40:54.887
with a giant wad of tampons.

40:54.930 --> 40:56.802
That makes sense.

40:56.845 --> 40:57.846
Mm-hmm.
Sorry.

40:57.890 --> 40:59.021
Yep.

40:59.065 --> 41:00.719
So there was really no ghost?

41:00.762 --> 41:01.850
Of course there wasn't.

41:01.894 --> 41:03.548
Or was there?

41:03.591 --> 41:05.898
No, there wasn't.

41:05.941 --> 41:07.987
There's a rational explanation.

41:08.030 --> 41:09.945
I just told you what it was.

41:09.989 --> 41:12.948
Or... did you?

41:12.992 --> 41:14.994
Yes.

41:15.037 --> 41:16.996
Yes, she did.
Yeah.

41:17.039 --> 41:19.215
Okay. Guess we'll never know.

41:19.259 --> 41:21.609
No, we do know now.

41:21.653 --> 41:24.264
Or... do we?

41:24.307 --> 41:26.135
I would say we definitely do.

41:26.179 --> 41:27.572
But, definitely?

41:27.615 --> 41:29.443
Yes.

41:29.487 --> 41:30.662
Mm, do we, though?

41:30.705 --> 41:32.664
No, we do.

41:32.707 --> 41:34.187
But do we not?

41:34.230 --> 41:37.277
Oh, no. We-- oh. What?

41:37.320 --> 41:39.845
We def-- We do.Can we be sure though?
