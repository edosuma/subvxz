[crying]

20:22.955 --> 20:24.914
I'd like to thank you all
for coming

20:24.957 --> 20:28.656
to honor the memory
of my beloved wife, Jess...

20:28.700 --> 20:30.136
Uh...

20:30.180 --> 20:33.400
I'm sorry, I'm just realizing
I never caught her last name.

20:33.444 --> 20:34.924
- JESS'S MOM: Schlotz.
- Yikes.

20:34.967 --> 20:36.577
It was my husband's name.

20:36.621 --> 20:37.796
What's your maiden name?

20:37.840 --> 20:39.015
Borgwort.

20:39.058 --> 20:40.581
PETER:
That's also bad.

20:40.625 --> 20:43.019
Look, all I want to say is...

20:43.062 --> 20:45.369
I always knew
this day was coming.

20:45.412 --> 20:47.284
But what I didn't know was...

20:47.327 --> 20:49.895
just how much
I was gonna miss Jess.

20:49.939 --> 20:51.854
I would give anything

20:51.897 --> 20:54.160
if she were still here with me.

20:54.204 --> 20:55.945
[gasps]

20:55.988 --> 20:57.381
I'm okay.

20:57.424 --> 20:59.209
It's a miracle!

20:59.252 --> 21:01.254
[sobbing]
