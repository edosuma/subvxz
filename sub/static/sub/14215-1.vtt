WEBVTT

00:50.184 --> 00:51.419
[Man]
She said,

00:51.419 --> 00:54.188
"Do you think it'd be fun
if we got married?"

00:54.188 --> 00:55.823
[Woman]
And what did you say?

00:55.823 --> 00:58.125
[Man]
I took her up on it.

00:58.125 --> 01:01.095
I never wanted to be
away from her.

01:01.095 --> 01:03.130
She had the spark of life.

01:03.130 --> 01:05.633
[no audible dialogue]

02:28.482 --> 02:30.150
Careful.

02:33.153 --> 02:35.489
When did we last
wash that sweater?

02:37.491 --> 02:38.859
Right after the war.

02:38.859 --> 02:41.395
[chuckling]

02:44.632 --> 02:45.533
Christmas.

02:45.533 --> 02:47.368
In the '50s sometime
or the '60s.

02:47.368 --> 02:48.536
[laughing]
Shut up.

03:20.267 --> 03:21.635
I'll go make the fire.

03:58.238 --> 04:00.507
"You climbed
the bank and said,

04:00.507 --> 04:03.611
"'This is how you touch
other women,

04:03.611 --> 04:07.948
"the grass cutter's wife,
the lime burner's daughter.

04:07.948 --> 04:09.350
"And you searched your arms

04:09.350 --> 04:11.418
for the missing perfume
and knew--"

04:11.418 --> 04:14.254
Don't worry, darling.

04:14.254 --> 04:16.457
I expect I'm just
losing my mind.

04:16.457 --> 04:18.892
Shh-shh.

04:18.892 --> 04:22.329
"What good is it to be
the lime burner's daughter,

04:22.329 --> 04:24.365
"left with no trace

04:24.365 --> 04:26.934
"as if not spoken to
in the act of love,

04:26.934 --> 04:30.571
"as if wounded without
the pleasure of a scar.

04:30.571 --> 04:34.608
"You touched your belly
to my hands in the dry air

04:34.608 --> 04:39.546
"and said, 'I am
the cinnamon peeler's wife.

04:39.546 --> 04:41.615
Smell me.'"

05:45.612 --> 05:49.683
When I look away,
I forget what yellow means.

05:49.683 --> 05:52.453
But I can look again.

05:52.453 --> 05:56.590
Sometimes there's something
delicious in oblivion.

05:56.590 --> 05:58.926
I think you're
supposed to be able

05:58.926 --> 06:02.596
to put your fingers
inside the curled petal

06:02.596 --> 06:05.466
and feel the heat.

06:05.466 --> 06:07.468
[Man]
Well?

06:09.937 --> 06:12.606
I can't be sure.

06:12.606 --> 06:15.609
I can't be sure
if what I can feel

06:15.609 --> 06:19.079
is the heat
or my imagination.

06:20.881 --> 06:22.950
The heat attracts the bugs.

06:24.818 --> 06:28.589
Nature never fools around
just being decorative.

06:38.866 --> 06:41.535
[car beeping]

06:56.850 --> 06:58.752
[knocking]

07:04.124 --> 07:05.859
Yes?

07:05.859 --> 07:08.095
I don't quite know
how to introduce myself.

07:08.095 --> 07:11.899
I used to see your husband
at Meadowlake.

07:11.899 --> 07:14.001
I'm a regular visitor
there myself.

07:19.139 --> 07:20.874
Those are lovely flowers.

07:22.709 --> 07:26.113
I've never seen
those purple ones before.

07:26.113 --> 07:27.881
Hmm.

07:27.881 --> 07:30.150
The earth there must
really appeal to them.

07:35.222 --> 07:36.757
[chuckling]

07:36.757 --> 07:37.691
What?

07:37.691 --> 07:39.993
You could just
open the drawers.

07:39.993 --> 07:41.128
Remind yourself.

07:41.128 --> 07:42.596
What?

07:42.596 --> 07:43.931
Maybe
all the labels and lists

07:43.931 --> 07:45.566
are defeating the purpose.

07:47.801 --> 07:49.536
If you stopped
thinking about things

07:49.536 --> 07:50.804
the moment
you write them down,

07:50.804 --> 07:55.742
maybe that's the end
of your need to recall.

07:55.742 --> 07:57.978
I heard a story
at a dinner party

07:57.978 --> 08:00.047
about the German soldiers
on border patrol

08:00.047 --> 08:03.550
in Czechoslovakia
during the war.

08:03.550 --> 08:05.652
I heard it from that
Czech student of yours.

08:05.652 --> 08:07.187
Veronica.

08:07.187 --> 08:10.624
We spoke once
at a dinner party.

08:10.624 --> 08:12.626
Don't be nervous.

08:12.626 --> 08:15.028
It's a good story.

08:15.028 --> 08:19.766
She told me that each
of the German patrol dogs

08:19.766 --> 08:23.704
wore a sign saying "hund."

08:23.704 --> 08:25.806
"Why?" said the Czechs.

08:25.806 --> 08:31.144
And the Germans replied,
"Because that is a hund."

08:50.831 --> 08:52.299
It was one
of those craft shows

08:52.299 --> 08:55.636
where you look around
and wonder that the laws
of supply and demand

08:55.636 --> 08:58.772
can allow for the production
of so many macramÃ© ducks.

08:58.772 --> 09:00.207
[laughs]
Oh, God, those things
are everywhere.

09:00.207 --> 09:03.277
What do you do with them?
Oh, come on, Phoebe,
you've got one of those.

09:03.277 --> 09:05.212
You use it as a--
what do you call it--

09:05.212 --> 09:06.747
a light fixture holder
or som--

09:06.747 --> 09:08.081
I do not.
Phoebe, in the...

09:08.081 --> 09:09.616
Oh, yes.
Wait a second, I do.

09:09.616 --> 09:11.685
Fiona gave it to me.

09:11.685 --> 09:13.820
Yes, I did.
[chuckling]

09:14.922 --> 09:16.690
Would anybody
like some more?

09:16.690 --> 09:18.091
Mm.

09:28.902 --> 09:31.004
Ween...

09:36.176 --> 09:39.980
Wai-- Wain--

09:39.980 --> 09:42.149
No, but I'll have
a touch of wine.

09:42.149 --> 09:43.750
Yeah, Fiona,
that would be lovely.

09:43.750 --> 09:45.152
Some more wain.

09:49.122 --> 09:50.824
The thing is...

09:53.226 --> 09:55.896
half the time
I wander around

09:55.896 --> 09:57.664
looking for something
which I know

09:57.664 --> 10:00.801
is very pertinent.

10:00.801 --> 10:03.837
I can't remember what it is.

10:05.772 --> 10:10.377
Once the idea is gone,
everything is gone.

10:11.778 --> 10:14.081
I just wander around

10:14.081 --> 10:15.983
trying to figure out
what it was

10:15.983 --> 10:18.685
that was so important
earlier.

10:22.189 --> 10:25.926
I think I may be
beginning to disappear.

10:33.967 --> 10:36.103
[Woman]
And what year is it?

10:36.103 --> 10:37.838
2003.

10:37.838 --> 10:40.941
Fiona, if you found
a letter on the street,

10:40.941 --> 10:43.377
addressed,
with a stamp on it,

10:43.377 --> 10:45.645
what would you do with it?

10:45.645 --> 10:46.913
I'd mail it.

10:46.913 --> 10:48.849
And where would
you put it to mail it?

11:00.394 --> 11:03.864
And if there was a fire
in a movie theater,

11:03.864 --> 11:07.868
and you were the first person
to spot that fire,

11:07.868 --> 11:09.336
what would you do?

11:12.873 --> 11:14.808
Well, we don't go
to the movies much anymore,

11:14.808 --> 11:16.676
do we, Grant?

11:16.676 --> 11:20.047
All those multiplexes showing
the same American garbage.

11:32.959 --> 11:34.928
Have you seen my coat?

11:34.928 --> 11:36.963
There it is, dear.

11:36.963 --> 11:38.065
It's on your chair.

11:40.200 --> 11:41.168
Oh, yes.

11:41.168 --> 11:42.235
Fiona, would you mind

11:42.235 --> 11:44.838
if I asked you
a few more questions?

11:44.838 --> 11:47.340
Would you mind
taking a seat?

11:49.709 --> 11:53.046
I was just feeling
a little cold, that's all.

11:55.849 --> 11:58.985
[baby burbling]

12:03.290 --> 12:05.926
[sotto voce]
What an ugly baby.

12:23.043 --> 12:25.412
When did we move
into this cottage?

12:25.412 --> 12:29.082
Was it last year
or the year before?

12:34.855 --> 12:36.189
[sigh]

12:38.325 --> 12:40.193
No.
It was longer than that.

12:40.193 --> 12:43.330
It was when I left
the university,

12:43.330 --> 12:44.531
20 years ago.

12:49.870 --> 12:51.404
Hmm.

12:51.404 --> 12:54.341
Well, that's shocking.

12:57.310 --> 12:59.212
[chuckle]

13:06.920 --> 13:10.423
Let's just see how it goes,
shall we, hmm?

13:11.925 --> 13:12.959
Hmm?

13:12.959 --> 13:15.996
[Grant]
How is your husband doing?

13:15.996 --> 13:17.464
Okay.

13:17.464 --> 13:20.066
He and my wife struck up
quite a close friendship.

13:21.535 --> 13:23.069
I heard about that.

13:24.971 --> 13:26.940
So, uh,

13:26.940 --> 13:29.409
I'd like to speak to you
about something.

13:31.178 --> 13:33.547
If you have a minute.

13:33.547 --> 13:36.316
My husband did not
try to start anything
with your wife,

13:36.316 --> 13:38.084
if that's what
you're getting at.

13:38.084 --> 13:39.920
He did not
try to molest her.

13:39.920 --> 13:41.154
He's incapable of it.

13:41.154 --> 13:42.889
And anyway, he wouldn't.

13:42.889 --> 13:45.992
From what I hear,
it was the other way
around.

13:45.992 --> 13:47.961
No, uh,
that isn't it at all.

13:47.961 --> 13:51.164
I didn't come here
with any complaints.

13:51.164 --> 13:53.433
Oh.

13:53.433 --> 13:55.569
Oh, well, I'm sorry.
I thought you did.

13:59.940 --> 14:01.107
Maybe you should come in.

14:01.107 --> 14:05.111
It's not as warm a day
as it looks.

14:09.616 --> 14:12.185
[Fiona]
"Never let a person
make you feel guilty

14:12.185 --> 14:13.987
for your anger with God."

14:15.088 --> 14:18.024
Hmm. Random.

14:20.427 --> 14:24.231
I can't even see
what the point is.

14:24.231 --> 14:27.300
We can't be certain
this is what--

14:27.300 --> 14:28.501
You're far too young.

14:28.501 --> 14:30.370
"Should the patient
afflicted with the disease

14:30.370 --> 14:33.206
"remain at home...

14:33.206 --> 14:36.943
the caregiver
will very often
be the spouse."

14:38.545 --> 14:41.081
"The caregiver must preside
over the degeneration

14:41.081 --> 14:43.883
"of someone he or she
loves very much,

14:43.883 --> 14:45.552
"must do this
for years and years

14:45.552 --> 14:48.288
"with the news always
getting worse, not better,

14:48.288 --> 14:50.090
"must put up sometimes
with deranged

14:50.090 --> 14:53.159
"but at the same time
very personal insults,

14:53.159 --> 14:55.629
"and must somehow learn
to smile through it all.

14:55.629 --> 14:57.364
"Caregivers must
be able to diagnose

14:57.364 --> 14:59.633
"a wide variety
of ordinary ailments

14:59.633 --> 15:01.635
"under extraordinary
circumstances.

15:01.635 --> 15:04.037
"Imagine the person

15:04.037 --> 15:05.605
"suddenly upset
about something,

15:05.605 --> 15:08.174
"but completely unable
to communicate the problem

15:08.174 --> 15:11.111
or even to understand it
himself."

15:14.214 --> 15:16.082
Sounds like a regular marriage.

15:16.082 --> 15:17.317
[chuckle]

16:20.347 --> 16:22.315
[sigh]

17:54.741 --> 17:56.242
Hello, there!

17:59.579 --> 18:01.347
[shivering]
Oh!

18:01.347 --> 18:03.383
Hello, there.

18:50.563 --> 18:53.366
We are at that stage,
Grant.

18:56.369 --> 18:58.538
We are at that stage.

19:04.410 --> 19:05.879
[sigh]

19:08.581 --> 19:10.350
Well...

19:13.520 --> 19:15.688
if we do think of it...

19:15.688 --> 19:18.892
if we do...

19:18.892 --> 19:23.830
then it must be as something
that isn't permanent.

19:25.798 --> 19:30.670
A kind of experimental
treatment or...

19:32.505 --> 19:35.842
a rest cure of sorts.

19:46.719 --> 19:49.756
All right.

19:49.756 --> 19:50.857
All right.

19:50.857 --> 19:53.426
We can think
of it that way.

19:56.763 --> 20:00.466
We have to sit in the kitchen,
where I can hear Aubrey.

20:07.473 --> 20:10.510
Well, you might as well
have a cup of coffee.

20:10.510 --> 20:12.545
Thank you.

20:12.545 --> 20:18.351
My son put him on
the Sports Channel
a year ago Christmas.

20:18.351 --> 20:20.486
I don't know what
we'd do without it.

20:20.486 --> 20:22.488
Must be a struggle.

20:23.790 --> 20:25.892
Well, you know.

20:25.892 --> 20:28.628
You know what
struggle is by now.

20:31.497 --> 20:33.700
You're sure?
I'm sure.

20:35.635 --> 20:39.405
You don't want
to just get a sense
of the place?

20:39.405 --> 20:41.808
I don't want to make
this decision alone.

20:45.845 --> 20:46.946
What place?

20:51.517 --> 20:52.652
Just kidding!

20:54.420 --> 20:55.622
Fuck off.

21:03.696 --> 21:07.734
You're not making
this decision alone, Grant.

21:07.734 --> 21:10.436
I've already
made up my mind.

21:15.675 --> 21:16.576
Okay.

21:46.372 --> 21:48.374
[Woman]
It's time to go home now.

21:48.374 --> 21:50.009
[Man]
No, no.
Mrs. Taylor--

21:50.009 --> 21:51.844
Hi. Is this your son?
Yeah. I'm her son.

21:51.844 --> 21:55.048
Hi. I'm Betty.
It's time for your bath.

21:55.048 --> 21:57.083
Bath.
Yeah.

21:57.083 --> 21:58.785
You have to have
a bath now.

21:58.785 --> 22:00.553
Mama.

22:00.553 --> 22:03.756
Mr. Andersson?
Madeleine Montpelier.

22:03.756 --> 22:05.692
I'm the supervisor
here at Meadowlake.
Hi, there.

22:05.692 --> 22:08.528
I'm just going to take
you on the quick tour
of the facility,

22:08.528 --> 22:09.929
and then we can sit down

22:09.929 --> 22:11.464
and discuss
Mrs. Andersson's condition

22:11.464 --> 22:13.966
and the appropriate time
for admitting her.

22:17.437 --> 22:19.439
As you can see, we get
a lot of natural light.

22:19.439 --> 22:22.075
Yes,
I can see that.

22:22.075 --> 22:23.810
This
is my favorite room.

22:23.810 --> 22:25.645
Look, over there,
as you can see,

22:25.645 --> 22:27.680
they have
a puzzle on the go.

22:27.680 --> 22:28.848
They always have
a puzzle on the go.

22:28.848 --> 22:31.484
This works.
You know, it's real
important to us here

22:31.484 --> 22:33.720
that our residents
maintain social function,

22:33.720 --> 22:36.489
so a lot of our activities
and our whole layout

22:36.489 --> 22:37.457
is really geared toward--

22:37.457 --> 22:39.092
Hello, there,
Miss Madeleine.

22:39.092 --> 22:41.027
Hello, Michael.

22:41.027 --> 22:42.995
Now, as you can see,
we're coming into
our common room,

22:42.995 --> 22:45.998
and again, we're really
emphasizing everybody
being social.

22:45.998 --> 22:47.533
So you can
bring the family.

22:47.533 --> 22:48.735
Everybody
can come and visit.

22:48.735 --> 22:51.471
We have
a state-of-the-art
entertainment system

22:51.471 --> 22:53.740
so the residents
can gather
and watch together.

22:53.740 --> 22:55.575
Hi, Madeleine.
Hello, ladies.

22:55.575 --> 22:57.610
Hello, Madeleine.
I got a Christmas sweater.

22:57.610 --> 22:59.579
Aren't you festive!

22:59.579 --> 23:01.114
And this
is our quiet corner

23:01.114 --> 23:04.150
for crafts and reading
and reflection.

23:04.150 --> 23:07.854
We have a lot of activities
for physical activity.

23:07.854 --> 23:11.057
Balloon badminton
and sit and fit.

23:11.057 --> 23:14.560
And here we have our
lovely new dining room.

23:14.560 --> 23:18.064
We can accommodate
any dietary preferences
or restrictions.

23:18.064 --> 23:22.068
We're just serving up
a little Christmas dinner
early for the families.

23:22.068 --> 23:24.036
The old Meadowlake
is just next door,

23:24.036 --> 23:27.406
and that's a day center
now, but, um...

23:27.406 --> 23:29.142
this for the permanent
residents.

23:29.142 --> 23:30.643
This is
brand-spanking new.

23:30.643 --> 23:32.612
So let's go upstairs,
shall we?

23:34.947 --> 23:37.717
Just taking my tea
for a ride.

23:38.584 --> 23:41.654
Oh, look at this one,
Flo.

23:41.654 --> 23:44.157
He's a real charmer,
isn't he?

23:44.157 --> 23:46.893
Would you say,
are you a charmer?

23:46.893 --> 23:49.162
I think you could say
I was kind of a charmer.

23:49.162 --> 23:51.731
[chuckles]
You're a rascal.

23:51.731 --> 23:53.866
Mr. Andersson is here
about his wife, Eliza.
Behave yourself.

23:53.866 --> 23:56.169
Ahh.
I should have known it.

23:56.169 --> 23:58.871
At this age, it's--

24:00.139 --> 24:02.809
What do the kids
call it, Flo? It's--

24:02.809 --> 24:04.877
It's a real clusterfuck.

24:04.877 --> 24:07.079
All the charmers are taken.

24:07.079 --> 24:09.882
Or dead. Mostly dead.
[elevator dings]

24:09.882 --> 24:11.884
You're kind of charming
yourself, sweetheart.

24:13.219 --> 24:14.220
Shall we?

24:23.062 --> 24:25.531
This is our second floor,
the extended care wing.

24:25.531 --> 24:26.899
The elevators, of course,

24:26.899 --> 24:28.034
have the lockdown system,

24:28.034 --> 24:30.469
and this is where
the patients can move to

24:30.469 --> 24:32.572
once they become
more progressed.

24:32.572 --> 24:35.241
Interesting choice
of words.

24:35.241 --> 24:38.544
Why don't I show you
some of the rooms here,
while we're at it?

24:38.544 --> 24:40.847
Then we can go back down
and see the regular rooms

24:40.847 --> 24:41.914
where Mrs. Andersson
will be living.

24:41.914 --> 24:44.550
No, that will not
be necessary.

24:44.550 --> 24:46.752
My wife will not be
progressing to this floor.

24:46.752 --> 24:48.988
All right.

24:48.988 --> 24:50.656
â™ª [Muzak]

24:50.656 --> 24:51.958
Who chooses the music?

24:51.958 --> 24:53.726
I'm sorry?

24:53.726 --> 24:54.961
I'm assuming
it's not the residents.

24:54.961 --> 24:58.231
I don't see any of them
singing along.

24:58.231 --> 25:02.034
Yeah, well. You know the rooms
on the regular floors all have
their own stereo systems

25:02.034 --> 25:04.203
so the patients can listen
to whatever they like.

25:04.203 --> 25:05.171
How kind.

25:07.173 --> 25:10.743
Now, we don't admit anyone
during the month of December,

25:10.743 --> 25:12.678
so Mrs. Andersson will
have to wait till January

25:12.678 --> 25:14.714
to make the big move.

25:14.714 --> 25:19.285
Just December, Christmas,
you know, too many
emotional pitfalls.

25:19.285 --> 25:21.153
Right.
Sorry to interrupt,
Madeleine.

25:21.153 --> 25:22.855
I'm looking for
those documents
on Aubrey Burke.

25:22.855 --> 25:24.757
Sure. Go ahead.

25:24.757 --> 25:27.760
Mr. Andersson,
this is Kristy,
our new managing nurse.

25:27.760 --> 25:30.029
Against some people's
better judgment.

25:30.029 --> 25:32.031
Now, now.
[chuckles]

25:32.031 --> 25:34.300
Mr. Andersson is here
about his wife,
Mrs. Andersson,

25:34.300 --> 25:35.768
who will be
joining us in January.

25:35.768 --> 25:36.903
Hi, there.
Hi.

25:36.903 --> 25:38.037
We also have a policy,

25:38.037 --> 25:39.805
which I'm sure you saw
in the brochure,

25:39.805 --> 25:41.807
that our new residents
are not allowed visitors

25:41.807 --> 25:43.743
or receiving phone calls
during the first 30 days,

25:43.743 --> 25:45.711
just to give them
a chance to settle in.

25:45.711 --> 25:46.946
What sort of visitors?

25:50.983 --> 25:53.853
Everyone.
Even close relatives.

25:53.853 --> 25:55.554
I couldn't just
leave her here.

25:55.554 --> 25:57.957
We understand,
it is very difficult

25:57.957 --> 26:00.693
to leave a loved one
in a new environment
for so long,

26:00.693 --> 26:03.829
but most people need
that time to settle in.

26:03.829 --> 26:05.765
Before we had
this rule in place,

26:05.765 --> 26:07.733
residents would forget
again and again

26:07.733 --> 26:08.968
why they were being
left here.

26:08.968 --> 26:10.169
Whereas we find,

26:10.169 --> 26:12.872
you give them the month
to settle in,

26:12.872 --> 26:15.174
and they're happy as clams.

26:15.174 --> 26:18.978
And after that,
a little visit home
every now and then,

26:18.978 --> 26:20.947
perfectly fine.

26:20.947 --> 26:22.782
We'll take good care
of her, I promise.

26:27.620 --> 26:29.889
Knock-knock.
Oh, no! Not again.

26:29.889 --> 26:32.892
Knock-knock. Boo.

26:32.892 --> 26:36.062
[general chatter]

26:41.000 --> 26:42.969
She's bringing two babies.
Two babies?

26:42.969 --> 26:46.238
She's got a new baby,
four months old.

27:32.118 --> 27:35.755
â™ª [guitar]

29:34.974 --> 29:36.342
Smells good.

29:38.944 --> 29:42.314
I was going to go
for a ski, but I thought
I shouldn't chance it,

29:42.314 --> 29:45.017
what with the Alzheimer's
and all.

29:45.017 --> 29:46.152
Why didn't you wake me?

29:46.152 --> 29:47.987
What are these, Grant?

29:57.296 --> 30:00.132
Those are the documents
you're supposed to sign

30:00.132 --> 30:03.002
if you decide
to go to Meadowlake.

30:03.002 --> 30:05.070
That is exactly
what I have decided.

30:05.070 --> 30:07.973
You were to go an sign these
and leave them there.

30:07.973 --> 30:11.577
I wouldn't be allowed
to visit you for 30 days.

30:19.018 --> 30:21.220
30 days isn't
such a long time

30:21.220 --> 30:24.423
after 44 years.

30:24.423 --> 30:26.358
I don't think
I like the place.

30:30.930 --> 30:36.468
I don't think we should
be looking for something
we like, Grant.

30:36.468 --> 30:39.605
I don't think
we'll ever find that.

30:41.040 --> 30:43.609
I think all we can aspire
to in this situation

30:43.609 --> 30:46.245
is a little bit of grace.

30:53.953 --> 30:56.488
Hmm?

30:58.257 --> 31:02.595
â™ª Come a little bit closer â™ª

31:02.595 --> 31:06.565
â™ª Hear what I have to say â™ª

31:15.241 --> 31:19.578
â™ª Just like children
sleeping â™ª

31:19.578 --> 31:23.949
â™ª We can dream
this night away â™ª

31:30.456 --> 31:33.492
I suppose I'll be
dressed up all the time.

31:35.160 --> 31:40.099
It will be sort of like...
in a hotel.

31:44.336 --> 31:45.938
How do I look?

31:45.938 --> 31:47.206
Just like always.

31:47.206 --> 31:48.907
Just as you've
always looked.

31:48.907 --> 31:50.976
And how does that look?

31:53.212 --> 31:55.114
Direct and vague...

31:56.582 --> 31:59.051
sweet and ironic.

32:04.990 --> 32:07.559
Is that how I look?

32:10.496 --> 32:15.534
[on radio]
â™ª Because I'm still
in love with you â™ª

32:15.534 --> 32:20.039
â™ª I want to see you
dance again â™ª

32:20.039 --> 32:22.274
Oh. Remember?

32:25.110 --> 32:26.979
Surprised, Grant?

32:26.979 --> 32:28.347
No, I'm not surprised.

32:28.347 --> 32:32.051
I'm just grateful
you can remember that.

32:32.051 --> 32:35.154
I'm not all gone, Grant.
Just...

32:35.154 --> 32:37.189
[sigh] going--

32:40.125 --> 32:43.028
There are things
I wish would go away.

32:44.963 --> 32:50.035
But won't. You know.
Things we don't talk about.

32:55.240 --> 32:58.143
You never left me.

32:58.143 --> 32:59.345
You still made love to me,

32:59.345 --> 33:02.047
despite disturbing
demands elsewhere.

33:06.285 --> 33:11.490
But all those sandals, Grant.
All those bare female toes.

33:14.059 --> 33:17.563
What could you do but
be a part of the time
you were a part of?

33:17.563 --> 33:20.232
All those pretty girls.

33:20.232 --> 33:23.068
Didn't seem like anyone
was willing to be left out.

33:25.204 --> 33:26.505
I think you did all right,

33:26.505 --> 33:31.276
compared to some
of your colleagues.

33:31.276 --> 33:33.545
Those who left their wives.

33:36.081 --> 33:38.517
And the women who
wouldn't put up with it.

33:41.754 --> 33:47.092
I think people
are too demanding.

33:47.092 --> 33:50.195
People want to be in love
every single day.

33:50.195 --> 33:55.134
What a liability.
And then that silly girl.

33:55.134 --> 33:57.035
That silly girl Veronica.

33:58.170 --> 34:00.806
Girls that age
are always going around

34:00.806 --> 34:04.276
saying they're going
to kill themselves.

34:04.276 --> 34:06.078
But that was that.

34:08.147 --> 34:09.581
Promised me a new life.

34:09.581 --> 34:12.050
We moved out here,

34:12.050 --> 34:15.320
that is exactly
what you gave me.

34:17.623 --> 34:19.591
How long ago was that?

34:19.591 --> 34:22.728
20 years.

34:22.728 --> 34:24.463
[shuddering]

34:26.799 --> 34:28.734
God, that's shocking.

34:30.702 --> 34:35.340
So you see, I'm going...

34:35.340 --> 34:38.210
but I'm not gone.

34:49.388 --> 34:52.858
â™ª And we were lovers â™ª

34:52.858 --> 34:58.130
â™ª I loved you
with all my heart â™ª

35:06.638 --> 35:09.308
Fiona.
Grant.

35:12.411 --> 35:13.278
Don't go.

35:15.714 --> 35:17.850
That's what is happening,
Grant.

35:17.850 --> 35:21.153
It's happening...right now.

35:51.350 --> 35:52.284
Fiona.

35:54.486 --> 35:56.421
Hello.
I'm checking in today.

35:56.421 --> 35:58.290
My name
is Fiona Andersson.

35:58.290 --> 35:59.291
Yes, Mrs. Andersson.

35:59.291 --> 36:01.493
We have your room
all ready for you.

36:01.493 --> 36:02.928
Perfect.
We'll have our supervisor,

36:02.928 --> 36:04.296
Mrs. Montpelier, show you.

36:04.296 --> 36:06.665
I'll go fetch her.
She's expecting you.

36:06.665 --> 36:07.833
Thank you.

36:09.201 --> 36:10.369
Fiona.

36:11.403 --> 36:12.704
Grant.

36:12.704 --> 36:14.306
I can't go away
from you like this.

36:14.306 --> 36:19.478
We had nothing
to tie us down, Grant.

36:19.478 --> 36:22.414
You could have
just driven away
and forsaken me.

36:22.414 --> 36:24.583
But you didn't.

36:26.451 --> 36:28.220
I thank you for that.

36:32.891 --> 36:35.260
Mrs. Andersson.
Oh, hello.

36:35.260 --> 36:37.262
How do you do?
I'm Madeleine.
Hello.

36:37.262 --> 36:38.864
Should I give
you two a moment?

36:38.864 --> 36:40.732
No, thank you.
Yes, please.

36:40.732 --> 36:42.601
All right, then, well,
we'll get you settled
in your room,

36:42.601 --> 36:44.703
and then I'd like to give you
a tour of the facility.

36:44.703 --> 36:47.439
That'd be lovely.
Thank you.
Right this way.

36:53.612 --> 36:57.482
So, as you can see,
we get a lot
of natural light.

36:58.717 --> 37:01.353
Here we go.

37:08.460 --> 37:11.930
Yes.
This'll do just fine.

37:11.930 --> 37:14.533
Good. I'm so glad
you like it. Now, is--

37:14.533 --> 37:16.234
is this all you brought
with you today?

37:16.234 --> 37:17.970
For now.
We'll see how it goes.

37:19.972 --> 37:23.909
Well, if you need any
help arranging things,
you just let me know.

37:23.909 --> 37:27.579
Thank you,
Mrs. Montpelier.

37:27.579 --> 37:30.782
Now, if you wouldn't mind,
I-I'd like to say good-bye
to my husband.

37:30.782 --> 37:35.420
We haven't been
apart for a month
for the last 44 years.

37:35.420 --> 37:36.688
It could be quite something.

37:45.430 --> 37:47.299
Please, Fiona.

37:50.836 --> 37:52.938
[sigh]
Grant.

37:52.938 --> 37:55.707
Fiona--

37:55.707 --> 37:57.776
You know what I'd like?

38:01.446 --> 38:03.482
I'd like to make love,

38:03.482 --> 38:06.518
and then
I'd like you to go.

38:06.518 --> 38:08.053
Because
I need to stay here,

38:08.053 --> 38:09.888
and if you
make it hard for me,

38:09.888 --> 38:12.524
I might cry so hard
I'll never stop.

38:45.691 --> 38:47.459
Go now.

38:49.961 --> 38:51.663
Go now.

39:37.442 --> 39:38.677
[Woman]
"All of the officers

39:38.677 --> 39:39.845
"were from outside
the local area,

39:39.845 --> 39:41.980
"and it probably had not
entered their minds

39:41.980 --> 39:44.816
"that almost all of us
were named McDonald.

39:44.816 --> 39:47.152
"Nobody moved except for
the shuffling of feet.

39:47.152 --> 39:49.821
The red roo"-- Hey.

39:49.821 --> 39:51.790
Hello, there.
Kristy.
We met on your tour.

39:51.790 --> 39:53.592
How's Mrs. Andersson?
Has she settled in?

39:53.592 --> 39:55.761
I'm wondering
if I could have

39:55.761 --> 39:57.896
a moment of your time
to ask your advice?

39:57.896 --> 40:00.398
Oh, sure. I was just
reading to Mr. Burke here.

40:00.398 --> 40:01.767
Maybe when we finish
this chapter,

40:01.767 --> 40:03.668
I can come find you
in the dining room?

40:03.668 --> 40:05.670
Sure. That's fine.

40:07.639 --> 40:10.776
Mm-- "The red roof lights
revolved in the afternoon sun,

40:10.776 --> 40:12.878
and even the dogs were
temporarily quiet."

40:27.726 --> 40:31.830
Hi, there, Mr. Andersson.
Now, how can I help you?

40:31.830 --> 40:33.732
Going down the center
of the dining room--

40:33.732 --> 40:36.868
That's Frank. He used
to be the play-by-play guy
for the Winnipeg Jets.

40:36.868 --> 40:38.970
Really?
Yeah.

40:38.970 --> 40:41.940
He loved his job
too much to retire.

40:41.940 --> 40:43.875
Frank's
on the second floor.

40:47.846 --> 40:52.617
I just--
My wife has always been

40:52.617 --> 40:55.754
sort of a different
sort of person.

40:55.754 --> 41:00.692
I've been told
that Alzheimer's can't be
confirmed until after--

41:00.692 --> 41:02.994
And on our way here today,

41:02.994 --> 41:04.729
we passed
this conservation area

41:04.729 --> 41:08.133
where we went
for a walk last spring.

41:08.133 --> 41:10.569
And there were these
gorgeous flowers.
The skunk lilies.

41:10.569 --> 41:12.504
Oh, those are
beautiful, aren't they?

41:12.504 --> 41:15.140
Yes, they really made
an impression, see?

41:15.140 --> 41:17.742
And even though the whole
place was covered in snow,

41:17.742 --> 41:20.245
she said, "Oh, remember?"

41:21.947 --> 41:25.116
Now, that was--
that was...quite recently.

41:25.116 --> 41:27.085
And isn't
the short-term memory

41:27.085 --> 41:28.820
the thing
that goes first?

41:28.820 --> 41:33.124
Well, yeah,
but not all at once.

41:33.124 --> 41:34.893
And what's comforting

41:34.893 --> 41:36.561
is the long-term memory
sometimes stays

41:36.561 --> 41:37.562
for quite a long time.

41:39.998 --> 41:43.101
Yeah, her long-term memory
seems quite intact.

41:43.101 --> 41:46.705
But when she mentioned that,
about the skunk lilies,

41:46.705 --> 41:49.808
it was all I could do not
to turn the truck around.

41:49.808 --> 41:56.214
What if this is just her
just being herself?

41:56.214 --> 41:58.750
She's far too young to--

42:00.085 --> 42:01.887
She is young.

42:01.887 --> 42:04.890
And it is hard.

42:04.890 --> 42:07.692
No doubt about that.

42:07.692 --> 42:09.828
A month is
a real long time.

42:12.530 --> 42:15.767
I mean, between
you and me, I don't know
about the policy myself.

42:15.767 --> 42:18.770
I think it makes it
easier for the staff
is what I think.

42:18.770 --> 42:22.908
Look. I'll give you
my pager number.

42:24.309 --> 42:25.977
You can call me
whenever you want.

42:25.977 --> 42:28.713
You can call me every day
if you feel like it.

42:32.017 --> 42:34.286
I don't know what to do.

42:36.054 --> 42:38.990
Mr. Andersson, your wife
wrote you this note,

42:38.990 --> 42:41.226
and she asked me
to pass it along.

42:51.303 --> 42:52.737
Okay.

42:58.843 --> 43:00.979
Thank you so much.

43:12.691 --> 43:15.193
[no audible dialogue]

43:25.837 --> 43:28.873
[Grant reading]
"Throughout much of
the thinking brain,

43:28.873 --> 43:34.179
gooey plaques now crowd
neurons from outside
the cell membranes."

43:36.014 --> 43:38.750
"And knotty tangles

43:38.750 --> 43:43.822
mangle microtubal transports
from inside the cells."

43:52.630 --> 43:56.868
"All told, tens of millions
of synapses dissolve away."

43:58.970 --> 44:02.007
"Because the structures
and substructures of the brain

44:02.007 --> 44:03.975
"are so highly specialized,

44:03.975 --> 44:08.079
"the precise location
of the neuronal loss

44:08.079 --> 44:13.985
determines
what specific abilities
will become impaired."

44:18.323 --> 44:23.128
"It is like a series
of circuit breakers

44:23.128 --> 44:27.999
in a large house,
flipping off one by one."

45:27.192 --> 45:29.060
That's a great-looking
coffee maker.

45:29.060 --> 45:31.129
I always meant
to get one of those.

45:32.964 --> 45:36.334
I saw they had them on sale
at Canadian Tire.

45:36.334 --> 45:39.904
They gave it to us,
my son and his wife.

45:39.904 --> 45:41.940
They live in Kamloops, B.C.

45:41.940 --> 45:45.443
They send us more stuff
than we can handle.

45:45.443 --> 45:49.447
Wouldn't hurt
if they spent the money
to come see us instead.

45:51.316 --> 45:53.852
I suppose they're busy
with their own lives.

45:53.852 --> 45:56.321
Not so busy they couldn't
go to Hawaii last year.

45:56.321 --> 45:57.789
I mean,
you could understand it

45:57.789 --> 46:00.925
if there was someone
in the family closer at hand,

46:00.925 --> 46:04.362
but, uh...
he's the only one.

46:08.233 --> 46:12.070
People do get lonely,

46:12.070 --> 46:15.406
especially when
they're deprived of seeing
someone they care about.

46:20.111 --> 46:22.013
Fiona, for instance.

46:24.983 --> 46:26.951
My wife.

46:26.951 --> 46:29.354
I thought you said
you went and visited her.

46:32.023 --> 46:34.092
I do.

46:34.092 --> 46:37.128
No, that's not it.

46:37.128 --> 46:39.063
[Kristy]
She's really settling in well.

46:39.063 --> 46:40.899
Good. Good.

46:40.899 --> 46:42.834
Looking forward to
seeing you tomorrow,
Mr. Andersson.

46:42.834 --> 46:45.103
Right. So I'll see you
tomorrow morning, then.

46:45.103 --> 46:48.139
Now, remember, she may
be a little surprised
to see you.

46:50.208 --> 46:51.943
Don't be shaken by that.

46:51.943 --> 46:54.145
Just-- She hasn't
seen you in a while.

46:54.145 --> 46:56.181
She's sort of
settled in here.

46:58.183 --> 46:59.584
[Grant]
I understand.

47:13.031 --> 47:17.035
There you are. I'll
walk you down to her.

47:17.035 --> 47:19.337
Wow. Narcissus
this early.

47:19.337 --> 47:21.539
You must have spent
a fortune.

47:21.539 --> 47:24.242
We brought it back here.
Hi, Mr. Andersson.

47:24.242 --> 47:26.211
It's great to see you.

47:26.211 --> 47:29.113
I'm gonna help you find
your sweater, Mrs. Albright.

47:29.113 --> 47:32.984
All right. Here we are.
There is her room,
right over there.

47:32.984 --> 47:35.053
You remember from last time
you were here, don't you?

47:35.053 --> 47:38.289
Her nameplate's
right on the door.
I'll leave you to it.

48:19.564 --> 48:22.967
There she is. Now you just
go over and say hello,

48:22.967 --> 48:27.038
and try not to startle her--
Remember, she may not--

48:27.038 --> 48:28.940
Well, just go ahead.

48:48.092 --> 48:51.429
Bridge.
Deadly serious.

48:51.429 --> 48:55.066
Quite rabid about it.

48:55.066 --> 48:58.202
I can remember being
like that at college
for a while.

48:58.202 --> 49:00.638
My friends and I
would cut class

49:00.638 --> 49:03.341
and sit
in the common room
and smoke

49:03.341 --> 49:05.610
and play like cutthroats.

49:05.610 --> 49:07.312
One's name was Phoebe.

49:07.312 --> 49:09.147
I don't remember
the others.

49:09.147 --> 49:10.481
Phoebe Hart.

49:10.481 --> 49:13.384
Oh, you knew her, too.

49:13.384 --> 49:16.254
Can I get you something?
A cup of tea?

49:16.254 --> 49:19.324
I'm afraid the coffee's
not up to much here.

49:19.324 --> 49:20.325
I don't drink tea.

49:20.325 --> 49:22.593
Oh.

49:22.593 --> 49:24.228
I brought you some flowers.

49:24.228 --> 49:27.298
I thought they might do
to brighten up your room.

49:27.298 --> 49:29.467
I went to your room,
but you weren't there.

49:29.467 --> 49:32.203
Well, no, I'm here.

49:35.039 --> 49:36.240
So you've made a new friend.

49:37.542 --> 49:40.211
Oh, that's just Aubrey.

49:40.211 --> 49:45.583
The funny thing is I knew
him years and years ago.

49:45.583 --> 49:47.118
He used to work in the store,

49:47.118 --> 49:51.155
the hardware store where
my grandpa used to shop.

49:51.155 --> 49:54.158
He and I were always
kidding around,

49:54.158 --> 49:57.395
but he never could get up
the nerve to ask me out.

49:57.395 --> 50:00.765
Until the very last weekend,
he took me to a ball game.

50:00.765 --> 50:05.670
But my grandpa showed up
to drive us home.

50:05.670 --> 50:09.207
I was up visiting
for the summer.

50:09.207 --> 50:12.343
Visiting my grandparents.

50:12.343 --> 50:14.445
They lived in a cottage
on a lake.

50:16.214 --> 50:19.183
Fiona, I know where
your grandparents lived.

50:19.183 --> 50:21.052
It's where we lived.
We live.

50:22.320 --> 50:23.721
Really?

50:25.623 --> 50:27.325
I'd better go back.

50:27.325 --> 50:29.761
He thinks he can't play
without me sitting there.

50:29.761 --> 50:33.030
It's silly. I hardly
know the game anymore.

50:33.030 --> 50:35.233
I'm afraid you'll have
to excuse me.

50:35.233 --> 50:36.200
Will you be through soon?

50:36.200 --> 50:38.202
We should be.
I mean, it depends.

50:38.202 --> 50:41.272
If you asked that grim-looking
lady over there nicely,

50:41.272 --> 50:43.441
she'll get you a cup of tea.

50:45.076 --> 50:46.677
No, I'm fine.
I can leave you, then?

50:46.677 --> 50:50.248
You can entertain yourself?
Must all seem strange to you.

50:50.248 --> 50:53.117
But you'll be surprised
how soon you get used to it.

50:53.117 --> 50:55.453
You'll get to know
who everybody is,

50:55.453 --> 51:00.057
except that some of them
are pretty well off
in the clouds, you know?

51:00.057 --> 51:05.196
Hmm. Can't expect them all
to get to know who you are.

52:24.208 --> 52:27.211
Hey, I've been thinking
of dying my hair.
What do you think?

52:27.211 --> 52:30.414
Do you think I'd look
good with red hair?

52:50.368 --> 52:53.271
You caught her at
sort of a bad moment,
involved in a game.

52:53.271 --> 52:55.439
She isn't even playing.

52:55.439 --> 52:57.708
Well, but her friend's
playing, Aubrey.

52:57.708 --> 52:59.210
Now, who is Aubrey?

52:59.210 --> 53:01.212
That's who he is,
Aubrey.

53:01.212 --> 53:02.680
You know, they get
these attachments.

53:02.680 --> 53:04.715
That kind of takes over
for a while.

53:04.715 --> 53:06.751
Best buddy kind of thing.

53:06.751 --> 53:08.286
Sort of a phase.

53:09.253 --> 53:11.222
Does she even know who I am?

53:12.690 --> 53:14.625
No, she might not.

53:14.625 --> 53:18.462
Not today, and then,
tomorrow you never know.

53:18.462 --> 53:21.432
Things change
back and forth
all the time.

53:21.432 --> 53:22.466
You'll see
the way it is

53:22.466 --> 53:24.335
once you get used
to coming here.

53:24.335 --> 53:25.970
You'll learn
not to take it
so personal.

53:25.970 --> 53:29.307
Learn to take it
day by day.

53:31.576 --> 53:34.345
[inaudible dialogue]

53:51.996 --> 53:53.898
Oh, I'm sorry.

53:53.898 --> 53:56.500
I'll have to go
and fix that now.

54:26.497 --> 54:28.766
[Man, TV]
Here's Yung Menenikenaha,

54:28.766 --> 54:32.570
desperately clinging
to his one-stroke lead.

54:32.570 --> 54:34.372
Here's the swing.

54:34.372 --> 54:36.307
It doesn't look good.

54:36.307 --> 54:38.709
Looks like he's pushed it
out to the right.

54:38.709 --> 54:40.711
It lands 25 feet
from the green.

54:40.711 --> 54:42.546
This must be disappointing.

54:42.546 --> 54:45.016
It doesn't look good
for Yung Menenikenaha.

54:45.016 --> 54:47.385
He was three strokes
on the happy side of par

54:47.385 --> 54:48.452
until these last three holes.

54:53.290 --> 54:57.061
Look at you,
Mr. Andersson.

54:57.061 --> 54:59.664
I think you might
be one of our most
frequent visitors.

55:08.773 --> 55:10.474
Hi, Fiona.

55:10.474 --> 55:12.476
Oh, you are persistent,
aren't you?

55:12.476 --> 55:14.512
I brought you some books.

55:14.512 --> 55:16.881
They don't seem to have
an awful lot around here.

55:16.881 --> 55:19.383
Letters from Iceland
by Auden.

55:19.383 --> 55:22.653
We always meant
to read that together,
didn't we?

55:22.653 --> 55:25.056
Do you think
it'd be possible
to talk alone?

55:25.056 --> 55:26.624
Well, I don't know.

55:26.624 --> 55:29.427
Um, Aubrey's card game
starts in a few minutes,

55:29.427 --> 55:31.095
and then we usually
go walking,

55:31.095 --> 55:32.697
and then he does
his drawing--

55:32.697 --> 55:36.000
Or perhaps you can find
a bit of time later on.

55:36.000 --> 55:37.535
Um, I'll stay here.

55:37.535 --> 55:39.437
Or I'll come back
in a few hours.

55:39.437 --> 55:41.839
Oh, you are persistent,
aren't you?

56:04.595 --> 56:06.497
[Man, TV]
Up comes Kapanen--
Boy, oh, boy!

56:06.497 --> 56:08.532
[Frank]
Here we are at the Spectrum
in Philadelphia.

56:08.532 --> 56:10.801
It's sudden-death overtime.
They're tied 2-2.

56:10.801 --> 56:12.503
Here are the Leafs again,
led by Andreychuk.

56:12.503 --> 56:13.738
He carries it
over the blue line,

56:13.738 --> 56:15.706
winds up a shot right on!

56:15.706 --> 56:17.608
The bounce, the rebound
comes back behind the net.

56:17.608 --> 56:18.909
McCabe couldn't get to it.

56:18.909 --> 56:20.478
It goes back
on the left wing

56:20.478 --> 56:22.913
and here come the Flyers
led by Roenick again.

56:22.913 --> 56:25.516
Roenick and Mitchell,
what a twosome
this two has been.

56:25.516 --> 56:26.884
A shot right on!
Oh, it just went wide.

56:26.884 --> 56:28.686
Go for it, Frank.
Over to the right side.

56:28.686 --> 56:29.987
Here we go again.
The Leafs again.

56:29.987 --> 56:32.523
Here's Sundin carrying it
up over the line.

56:32.523 --> 56:35.526
Can't get a shot away
and it's cleared away
by Philadelphia.

56:35.526 --> 56:37.728
A loose puck
grabbed by Philadelphia
over on the left wing--

56:37.728 --> 56:40.598
I just came down to say
Aubrey is having his nap

56:40.598 --> 56:42.800
if you'd like to, um, talk.

56:42.800 --> 56:44.735
Oh, sure.

56:44.735 --> 56:46.804
Can we go somewhere
a little more private?

56:46.804 --> 56:48.506
[Frank]
...the side with Mitchell.
He shoots, he scores!

56:48.506 --> 56:49.907
If-- If you'd like.

56:49.907 --> 56:51.542
[Frank]
And Philly wins this series

56:51.542 --> 56:52.743
by a score of 3-2.

56:52.743 --> 56:54.678
That's it this season
for the Leafs.

56:54.678 --> 56:56.914
Look at Phil Hitchcock.
Is he a happy coach.

56:56.914 --> 56:58.849
Philadelphia wins 3-2.

56:58.849 --> 57:00.718
The game is over
in sudden-death overtime.

57:21.772 --> 57:24.141
Y-You said you had
some books for me?

57:24.141 --> 57:25.743
This.

57:27.578 --> 57:29.480
Letters from Iceland.

57:29.480 --> 57:33.083
Yes, yes.
You said by Auden.

57:33.083 --> 57:35.553
Yes. That's right.

57:35.553 --> 57:38.823
Now...where is Iceland?

57:42.092 --> 57:46.630
Well, Iceland
is in the middle
of the Atlantic.

57:46.630 --> 57:48.966
It's an island.

57:50.668 --> 57:52.903
Youngest country
in the world.

57:52.903 --> 57:55.206
It's constantly erupting.

57:55.206 --> 57:58.809
Volcanoes, earthquakes.

57:58.809 --> 58:02.847
It's always
shaking itself off.

58:04.014 --> 58:07.484
Wouldn't it be nice to come
from a young country?

58:07.484 --> 58:09.753
You do.
That's where you're from.

58:09.753 --> 58:13.090
That's where
your people are from.

58:13.090 --> 58:17.728
They immigrated here
in the late 1800s.

58:17.728 --> 58:20.497
But that's where
you're from, Fiona.

58:20.497 --> 58:25.836
And I teach-- Well, I taught
the myths from there.

58:25.836 --> 58:27.004
Norse mythology.

58:27.004 --> 58:28.739
I-I must have
been there, then.

58:28.739 --> 58:30.541
Have I been there?

58:30.541 --> 58:31.609
[sniffs]

58:31.609 --> 58:32.676
No.

58:34.578 --> 58:35.980
Oh.

58:35.980 --> 58:38.616
Why not?
Wasn't I curious?

58:38.616 --> 58:41.719
You were very curious.

58:41.719 --> 58:44.221
Very curious.

58:44.221 --> 58:48.259
You always said
there ought to be one place

58:48.259 --> 58:50.895
that you knew about
and you thought about

58:50.895 --> 58:52.863
and maybe even longed for,

58:52.863 --> 58:54.932
but you did never did
get to see.

59:01.572 --> 59:04.241
Did I say that?

59:04.241 --> 59:06.176
Yes, you said that.

59:20.991 --> 59:23.227
Well, I'd better
go and see to Aubrey.

59:23.227 --> 59:25.863
He'll be wanting a little
walk around, I suppose.

59:25.863 --> 59:26.964
It was nice chatting.

59:26.964 --> 59:29.800
You'll be back again
tomorrow, I suppose?

59:29.800 --> 59:33.637
Fiona, what are you doing--

59:33.637 --> 59:34.972
What are you doing
with Aubrey?

59:38.275 --> 59:41.979
He doesn't confuse me.

59:41.979 --> 59:44.615
He doesn't confuse me
at all.

59:48.886 --> 59:52.089
Well,
it's been nice chatting.

59:52.089 --> 59:54.892
I'll see you again
tomorrow, I suppose.

59:57.695 --> 1:00:02.032
[door opens, closes]

1:00:14.778 --> 1:00:17.648
[Grant]
These affections
between residents,

1:00:17.648 --> 1:00:18.816
do they ever go too far?

1:00:18.816 --> 1:00:20.117
[Kristy chuckles]

1:00:20.117 --> 1:00:21.852
Well, that depends
on what you mean.

1:00:21.852 --> 1:00:24.655
The problem we have here,
it's funny.

1:00:24.655 --> 1:00:26.290
It's actually
often the ones

1:00:26.290 --> 1:00:28.792
who haven't been friendly
with each other at all.

1:00:28.792 --> 1:00:30.294
I mean, they maybe
don't even know each other

1:00:30.294 --> 1:00:32.997
beyond knowing, like,
is it a man or is it a woman?

1:00:32.997 --> 1:00:34.098
And you'd think
it'd be the old guys

1:00:34.098 --> 1:00:36.133
trying to crawl in bed
with the old ladies,

1:00:36.133 --> 1:00:37.968
but half the time
it's the other way around.

1:00:37.968 --> 1:00:40.871
It's the old ladies
going after the old men.

1:00:40.871 --> 1:00:42.806
It could be they aren't
so worn out.

1:00:42.806 --> 1:00:44.875
[chuckling]

1:00:50.047 --> 1:00:54.752
Now don't get me wrong.
I don't mean Fiona.

1:00:54.752 --> 1:00:56.887
Fiona is a lady.

1:00:56.887 --> 1:00:59.256
She's a real lady.

1:01:00.791 --> 1:01:04.228
I sometimes wonder--

1:01:04.228 --> 1:01:06.296
You wonder what?

1:01:08.866 --> 1:01:14.138
I wonder if she isn't
putting on some kind
of...charade.

1:01:14.138 --> 1:01:16.040
A what?

1:01:16.040 --> 1:01:19.076
Some kind of act.

1:01:19.076 --> 1:01:22.312
Maybe some kind of punishment.

1:01:25.949 --> 1:01:27.951
Why would she do that?

1:01:34.691 --> 1:01:36.193
Oh.

1:02:05.389 --> 1:02:07.357
[Fiona]
Are you getting tired?

1:02:07.357 --> 1:02:08.926
[Aubrey]
No.
[Fiona]
Are you certain--

1:02:15.933 --> 1:02:18.268
Excuse me.

1:02:18.268 --> 1:02:20.437
Yes, Mr. Andersson?

1:02:20.437 --> 1:02:23.073
How can I help you?

1:02:23.073 --> 1:02:24.875
Fiona's wearing
someone else's sweater.

1:02:24.875 --> 1:02:27.311
[Madeleine]
Well, it's pretty,
isn't it?

1:02:27.311 --> 1:02:28.879
No, it's not pretty.
It's tacky.

1:02:28.879 --> 1:02:31.915
She would never wear it.
Well, I'll tell you what.

1:02:31.915 --> 1:02:33.383
You can talk
to the duty attendant

1:02:33.383 --> 1:02:35.152
on Mrs. Andersson's
wing.

1:02:35.152 --> 1:02:37.387
Boy, it's a marvel, really,

1:02:37.387 --> 1:02:39.923
the way she's getting him up
and out of that chair.

1:02:46.797 --> 1:02:48.198
Can you manage?

1:02:50.934 --> 1:02:52.302
Will you be all right?

1:02:52.302 --> 1:02:54.271
I'll
be back in a second.

1:02:57.040 --> 1:02:59.443
Fiona,
I'm your husband.

1:02:59.443 --> 1:03:01.311
Fiona, it's Grant.

1:03:01.311 --> 1:03:03.814
We've been married
for 45 years.

1:03:03.814 --> 1:03:07.217
Look at me, Fiona.
That is not your sweater.

1:03:07.217 --> 1:03:09.119
We had a good life
together.

1:03:09.119 --> 1:03:12.055
Those are your words,
Fiona, not mine.

1:03:12.055 --> 1:03:14.091
That is not your sweater.

1:03:14.091 --> 1:03:17.227
[Aubrey groaning]

1:03:20.130 --> 1:03:22.399
It's all right.

1:03:22.399 --> 1:03:25.269
It's all right.
It's all right.

1:03:25.269 --> 1:03:27.204
I'm coming
straight back.

1:03:27.204 --> 1:03:28.372
I'm coming
straight back.

1:03:28.372 --> 1:03:30.574
It's going to be
all right.

1:03:49.193 --> 1:03:52.296
I'll see you again
tomorrow, I suppose.

1:03:56.200 --> 1:03:58.101
Please...

1:03:59.570 --> 1:04:00.504
don't.

1:04:03.373 --> 1:04:06.343
Please, please don't.

1:04:09.846 --> 1:04:12.416
You're very persistent,
aren't you?

1:04:18.855 --> 1:04:22.226
I wish I--

1:04:22.226 --> 1:04:23.961
Wish I knew what--

1:04:29.499 --> 1:04:33.070
[sniffles]

1:04:33.070 --> 1:04:35.872
We'll see you again
tomorrow, I suppose.

1:05:19.182 --> 1:05:22.219
You're not doing
too well, are you?

1:05:22.219 --> 1:05:23.920
Well, no big surprise.

1:05:23.920 --> 1:05:27.090
What we're handling
isn't so easy.

1:05:29.259 --> 1:05:30.627
I thought
when I married,

1:05:30.627 --> 1:05:34.264
I'd be with someone
to the final stretch.

1:05:34.264 --> 1:05:37.434
I'm betting
you thought the same.

1:05:37.434 --> 1:05:39.636
Well, didn't work out.

1:05:39.636 --> 1:05:43.507
[Aubrey groaning]

1:05:43.507 --> 1:05:48.178
So, I, uh, think
you're here for a reason.

1:05:48.178 --> 1:05:51.648
I'm the kind of person
you can say things
flat out to, so shoot.

1:05:51.648 --> 1:05:55.652
[sigh]

1:05:55.652 --> 1:05:58.989
I wonder if you would
consider taking Aubrey
back to Meadowlake,

1:05:58.989 --> 1:06:02.025
maybe just for a visit.

1:06:02.025 --> 1:06:05.429
Or I suppose
I could take Aubrey
out there myself.

1:06:05.429 --> 1:06:07.164
I wouldn't mind that at all.

1:06:09.466 --> 1:06:11.168
[sigh]

1:06:12.269 --> 1:06:13.970
Homemade.

1:06:21.211 --> 1:06:22.245
Really?

1:06:25.215 --> 1:06:29.086
No. No, I can't do that.

1:06:29.086 --> 1:06:31.221
And the reason is
I don't want to upset him.

1:06:31.221 --> 1:06:32.723
But wouldn't he understand
it was just a visit?

1:06:32.723 --> 1:06:35.592
He understands everything.

1:06:35.592 --> 1:06:38.195
Now, if I go
to all that trouble,

1:06:38.195 --> 1:06:40.764
I'd prefer to take him
someplace that'd be
more fun, hmm?

1:06:40.764 --> 1:06:43.367
It would make more sense
to take him to the mall

1:06:43.367 --> 1:06:44.735
where there are kids
and whatnot.

1:06:44.735 --> 1:06:47.237
And then I'd have to
get him all ready,

1:06:47.237 --> 1:06:48.739
maneuver him
into the car.

1:06:48.739 --> 1:06:51.208
He's a big man.
He's not that easy
to manage.

1:06:51.208 --> 1:06:53.310
Even if I agreed to do it?

1:06:53.310 --> 1:06:54.578
You couldn't do it.
You don't know him.

1:06:54.578 --> 1:06:56.213
You couldn't manage him.

1:06:56.213 --> 1:06:58.281
And he wouldn't stand
your doing for him.

1:06:58.281 --> 1:07:03.120
And after all that,
what would he get
out of it?

1:07:03.120 --> 1:07:04.254
Uh...

1:07:05.455 --> 1:07:07.057
Hmm.

1:07:26.410 --> 1:07:27.811
Smoke?

1:07:27.811 --> 1:07:30.180
No. No, thanks.

1:07:30.180 --> 1:07:32.315
What, did you never,
or did you quit?

1:07:32.315 --> 1:07:33.583
I quit.

1:07:33.583 --> 1:07:34.818
How long ago?

1:07:34.818 --> 1:07:39.589
Oh, 30 years,
maybe more.

1:07:39.589 --> 1:07:41.224
I quit quitting.

1:07:43.527 --> 1:07:46.496
Just made a resolution
to quit quitting,
that's all.

1:07:48.165 --> 1:07:51.334
So your wife's
depressed, huh?

1:07:52.302 --> 1:07:54.504
What's her name again?
I forget.

1:07:54.504 --> 1:07:56.239
Fiona.

1:07:56.239 --> 1:07:58.508
[Kristy]
And how old were you
when you met?

1:07:58.508 --> 1:08:00.610
She was 18.

1:08:00.610 --> 1:08:03.380
Holy, that's pretty young
to get married, eh?

1:08:03.380 --> 1:08:05.081
[chuckling]

1:08:07.484 --> 1:08:08.819
Wasn't my idea.

1:08:08.819 --> 1:08:11.354
You mean
she proposed to you?

1:08:11.354 --> 1:08:13.089
Well, that's lovely,
that's what I think.

1:08:13.089 --> 1:08:13.857
How'd she do it?

1:08:13.857 --> 1:08:16.526
She hadn't planned it
necessarily.

1:08:16.526 --> 1:08:20.363
We were in Tobermory
waiting for the ferry
to Manitoulin,

1:08:20.363 --> 1:08:23.266
and it was miserable
and rainy,

1:08:23.266 --> 1:08:27.137
and she was in a good mood.

1:08:27.137 --> 1:08:29.139
She didn't want any part
of my sour mood.

1:08:29.139 --> 1:08:31.541
[chuckles]
And what'd she do,
what'd she say?

1:08:31.541 --> 1:08:36.413
Well, she said,
"Do you think it'd be fun--

1:08:36.413 --> 1:08:40.250
Do you think it'd be fun
if we got married?"

1:08:40.250 --> 1:08:41.751
And what did you say?

1:08:41.751 --> 1:08:43.353
I took her up on it.

1:08:43.353 --> 1:08:45.222
I shouted yes.

1:08:49.893 --> 1:08:52.562
I never wanted
to be away from her.

1:08:54.731 --> 1:08:57.200
She had the spark of life.

1:08:59.269 --> 1:09:01.338
[Kristy]
You know, nothing
can take away

1:09:01.338 --> 1:09:05.742
what's happened to you
and what you've experienced.

1:09:05.742 --> 1:09:07.444
I don't think so, anyway.

1:09:07.444 --> 1:09:12.749
Even if it goes away somehow,
it's still there.

1:09:12.749 --> 1:09:14.885
It's still what you are.

1:09:16.853 --> 1:09:18.488
[Grant]
It's curious.

1:09:18.488 --> 1:09:19.623
What's curious?

1:09:19.623 --> 1:09:23.226
All of that
"madly in love" business.

1:09:23.226 --> 1:09:24.694
The beginning.

1:09:24.694 --> 1:09:30.400
I hear myself tell the story,
and it all sounds so crucial.

1:09:32.235 --> 1:09:33.937
I suppose it is.

1:09:33.937 --> 1:09:36.406
But compared to what
we ended up with,

1:09:36.406 --> 1:09:38.675
until recently...

1:09:40.644 --> 1:09:44.447
all of that seems
so superficial somehow.

1:09:46.683 --> 1:09:49.586
[chatter,
plates clinking]

1:10:22.652 --> 1:10:26.356
â™ª [heavy metal]

1:10:26.356 --> 1:10:29.993
Not such a fun place
to visit, eh?

1:10:29.993 --> 1:10:31.328
Excuse me?

1:10:31.328 --> 1:10:34.798
Not such a fun place
to visit.

1:10:34.798 --> 1:10:36.433
Fucking depressing.

1:10:38.468 --> 1:10:39.536
No offense.

1:10:39.536 --> 1:10:40.637
None taken.

1:10:42.639 --> 1:10:45.942
No one came
to visit you, huh?

1:10:45.942 --> 1:10:47.911
That must suck huge.

1:10:47.911 --> 1:10:51.514
Well, it would suck huge,
but I don't live here.

1:10:51.514 --> 1:10:53.683
I'm just visiting someone.

1:10:53.683 --> 1:10:55.986
Who? Which one?

1:10:55.986 --> 1:10:59.422
Beautiful woman
with the shock of hair.

1:10:59.422 --> 1:11:00.690
The one sitting
with her husband?

1:11:00.690 --> 1:11:03.493
You might say that.
Why wouldn't you?

1:11:03.493 --> 1:11:05.562
I wouldn't say that
because I'm her husband.

1:11:07.564 --> 1:11:10.367
So why aren't you
sitting with her, then?

1:11:13.436 --> 1:11:16.773
Just learned to give her
some space.

1:11:16.773 --> 1:11:19.275
She's in love with that man
she's sitting with.

1:11:19.275 --> 1:11:21.578
I don't like to disturb her.

1:11:21.578 --> 1:11:24.047
I just like to see her,
I suppose.

1:11:24.047 --> 1:11:27.584
Make sure she's
doing well, you know?

1:11:30.654 --> 1:11:33.623
I suppose that must seem
rather pathetic.

1:11:35.425 --> 1:11:37.761
I should be so lucky.

1:11:43.900 --> 1:11:45.435
Come on.

1:11:47.070 --> 1:11:48.638
[chuckles]

1:12:10.393 --> 1:12:11.995
She's not here.

1:12:11.995 --> 1:12:13.763
She's sick.

1:12:13.763 --> 1:12:16.466
He's not here, either.

1:12:16.466 --> 1:12:18.535
[laughing]

1:12:34.584 --> 1:12:36.453
[knocking]

1:12:44.761 --> 1:12:48.531
I brought you a book.

1:12:48.531 --> 1:12:50.734
It's all about Iceland.

1:12:50.734 --> 1:12:53.136
Thought you might like
to take a look at it.

1:12:53.136 --> 1:12:55.438
Why, thank you.

1:12:55.438 --> 1:12:56.539
[crying]

1:12:56.539 --> 1:12:59.576
Oh, what is it,
dear heart?

1:12:59.576 --> 1:13:02.445
[Aubrey sniffling]
What is it?
Oh, I see.

1:13:02.445 --> 1:13:04.748
Here. Here.
Here.

1:13:04.748 --> 1:13:07.050
Here, here, yes.

1:13:09.819 --> 1:13:12.789
Do you by any chance have
any influence around here?

1:13:12.789 --> 1:13:16.659
I've seen you
talking to them.

1:13:18.661 --> 1:13:20.697
Oh.

1:13:23.566 --> 1:13:24.701
We'll get to see each other.

1:13:24.701 --> 1:13:28.571
[groans]
You'll see.
We have to.

1:13:28.571 --> 1:13:31.608
I'll come and see you,

1:13:31.608 --> 1:13:34.110
and you'll come
and see me.

1:13:41.050 --> 1:13:42.619
You know,
I just wish his wife

1:13:42.619 --> 1:13:44.154
would hurry up
and get here.

1:13:44.154 --> 1:13:46.089
I wish she'd
get him out of here

1:13:46.089 --> 1:13:47.590
and cut the agony
short.

1:13:47.590 --> 1:13:49.025
Should I stay?

1:13:49.025 --> 1:13:51.861
Don't worry.
She's not sick,
you know.

1:13:53.997 --> 1:13:55.732
To keep her company.

1:13:55.732 --> 1:13:58.468
Well, they have to learn
to get over these things
by themselves.

1:13:58.468 --> 1:14:01.905
They've got short memories,
and that's not always so bad.

1:14:04.607 --> 1:14:05.775
Okay?

1:14:31.734 --> 1:14:35.872
[Woman]
Fiona. Her name is Fiona.

1:14:35.872 --> 1:14:37.240
And what's yours?

1:14:37.240 --> 1:14:40.543
I don't think
I was ever told that.

1:14:40.543 --> 1:14:43.179
Oh, I'm sorry.
It's Grant.

1:14:43.179 --> 1:14:45.181
Hmm.

1:14:45.181 --> 1:14:47.617
Hello, Grant.

1:14:47.617 --> 1:14:49.686
I'm Marian.

1:14:53.223 --> 1:14:56.526
Well, now that we know
each other's name,

1:14:56.526 --> 1:15:00.730
I can
tell you straight out
what I'm thinking.

1:15:00.730 --> 1:15:05.802
I don't know if he's still
so stuck on seeing your--

1:15:05.802 --> 1:15:06.936
seeing Fiona.

1:15:06.936 --> 1:15:09.806
I don't ask him,
he doesn't tell me.

1:15:09.806 --> 1:15:13.142
But I don't feel like
putting him back in there

1:15:13.142 --> 1:15:15.745
in case it turns out
to be more than that.

1:15:15.745 --> 1:15:18.615
I don't want him
getting hard to handle.

1:15:18.615 --> 1:15:22.185
I don't have any help.
It's just me here.

1:15:22.185 --> 1:15:23.653
I'm it.

1:15:23.653 --> 1:15:24.954
It is very hard for you.

1:15:24.954 --> 1:15:27.857
Did-- Did you ever consider
his going in there for good?

1:15:27.857 --> 1:15:30.894
No. I'm keeping him
right here.

1:15:30.894 --> 1:15:33.596
Well, that's very good
and noble of you.

1:15:33.596 --> 1:15:34.898
Oh, you think so?

1:15:34.898 --> 1:15:38.968
Well, noble is not
what I'm thinking about.

1:15:38.968 --> 1:15:40.970
No, but it isn't easy.

1:15:40.970 --> 1:15:43.306
No, it isn't,
but I don't have a choice.

1:15:43.306 --> 1:15:47.143
If I pay to put him in there,
I won't hold on to the house,

1:15:47.143 --> 1:15:49.679
and the house
is the only thing
we own outright.

1:15:52.315 --> 1:15:56.619
And it means a lot to me,
this house does.

1:15:56.619 --> 1:15:58.121
It's very nice.

1:15:59.088 --> 1:16:02.191
Well, I guess it's all right.

1:16:02.191 --> 1:16:05.895
I've done a lot on it,
fixing it up, keeping it up.

1:16:05.895 --> 1:16:07.931
Yes, I can see
that you have-- you do.

1:16:07.931 --> 1:16:09.832
I don't want to lose it.
No.

1:16:09.832 --> 1:16:12.068
I'm not going to lose it.
I see your point.

1:16:12.068 --> 1:16:14.070
See, the company
left us high and dry.

1:16:14.070 --> 1:16:20.109
In the end, they said
he owed them money.

1:16:21.711 --> 1:16:26.582
What do I think?
Well, he was pretty stupid.

1:16:26.582 --> 1:16:27.717
[sigh]

1:16:27.717 --> 1:16:31.821
But I'm not supposed
to ask, so I shut up.

1:16:31.821 --> 1:16:33.289
You've been married, huh?

1:16:33.289 --> 1:16:36.192
I mean, you are married.
You know what it's like.

1:16:37.961 --> 1:16:40.163
And then, in the middle
of all this,

1:16:40.163 --> 1:16:45.168
he gets sick from this virus,
and he goes into a coma.

1:16:50.173 --> 1:16:54.978
So that pretty much
takes him off the hook, hmm?

1:16:57.246 --> 1:16:58.848
It's bad luck.

1:16:59.983 --> 1:17:02.852
It's, no, just life.

1:17:06.622 --> 1:17:08.191
Can't beat life.

1:17:09.892 --> 1:17:11.227
No.

1:17:15.365 --> 1:17:16.833
[knocking at door]

1:17:23.106 --> 1:17:25.708
Oh. Hello.

1:18:07.383 --> 1:18:09.118
Perhaps you'd like me
to read to you.

1:18:11.254 --> 1:18:13.456
I don't have any books.

1:18:16.959 --> 1:18:18.361
Oh, there are some.

1:18:20.997 --> 1:18:23.066
Letters from Iceland.

1:18:32.308 --> 1:18:34.977
"Isn't it true,
however far we've wandered

1:18:34.977 --> 1:18:37.814
"into our provinces
of persecution,

1:18:37.814 --> 1:18:41.984
"where our regrets accuse,
we keep returning

"back to the common faith

1:18:44.087 --> 1:18:46.289
"from which
we've all dissented,

1:18:46.289 --> 1:18:50.293
"back to the hands,
the feet, the faces?

1:18:50.293 --> 1:18:54.030
"Children are always there
and take the hands,

1:18:54.030 --> 1:18:55.998
"even when they
are most terrified.

"Those in love cannot

"Artist and doctor

"Only the mad will never,

"For doctors keep

"in case their skill

"Lovers have lived so long

1:19:18.754 --> 1:19:22.325
"they want belief again

"And the artist prays

"'All that I push away

[George W. Bush]
To all the men and women of
the United States Armed Forces

1:19:48.084 --> 1:19:50.419
now in the Middle East,
the peace of a troubled world

1:19:50.419 --> 1:19:52.855
and the hopes
of an oppressed people

1:19:52.855 --> 1:19:56.092
now depend on you.

1:19:56.092 --> 1:19:57.927
How could they forget Vietnam?

1:19:57.927 --> 1:20:00.296
[Woman]
The air strike started again
at 5 A.M. this morning

1:20:00.296 --> 1:20:02.298
and lasted for three hours.

1:20:02.298 --> 1:20:04.167
Roadside explosions
have killed

1:20:04.167 --> 1:20:07.537
eight Iraqi civilians
and one U.S. soldier.

1:20:09.071 --> 1:20:10.806
Hmm.
Hmm.

1:20:17.113 --> 1:20:18.214
Here you go.

1:20:19.415 --> 1:20:22.552
Next time you do it,
just go pick it up, okay?

1:20:28.491 --> 1:20:31.227
Her muscles
are deteriorating.

1:20:31.227 --> 1:20:32.228
If she doesn't
improve soon,

1:20:32.228 --> 1:20:35.431
we're going to have to
put her on a walker.

1:20:35.431 --> 1:20:36.966
I keep trying
to get her walking,

1:20:36.966 --> 1:20:39.035
but she doesn't seem
to want to go anywhere.

1:20:39.035 --> 1:20:42.872
But, you know,
once they get on a walker,
they start to depend on it,

1:20:42.872 --> 1:20:44.941
and then they don't want
to walk much anymore,

1:20:44.941 --> 1:20:47.577
just get wherever it is
they have to go.

1:20:47.577 --> 1:20:49.946
You're going to have to
work at her harder.

1:20:49.946 --> 1:20:52.048
Try and encourage her.

1:20:52.048 --> 1:20:53.482
Sorry.

1:20:59.155 --> 1:21:01.023
Here you go.

1:21:13.002 --> 1:21:15.104
Mrs. Andersson.

1:21:15.104 --> 1:21:17.907
How would you like
to go on a field trip?

1:22:00.182 --> 1:22:03.452
They've kept it
so like it was.

1:22:05.921 --> 1:22:08.357
Who has?

1:22:08.357 --> 1:22:10.960
The people who live here.

1:23:20.730 --> 1:23:23.065
But everything...

1:23:29.338 --> 1:23:32.541
Everything
just reminds me of him.

1:23:34.210 --> 1:23:38.280
It wasn't enough,
I suppose.

1:23:38.280 --> 1:23:40.316
Who, Fiona?

1:23:41.684 --> 1:23:44.320
Who does everything
remind you of?

1:24:03.372 --> 1:24:07.209
I'd like to go home now,
if you don't mind.

1:24:12.181 --> 1:24:14.083
[Madeleine]
Now, as you know,

1:24:14.083 --> 1:24:17.253
we don't do extended care
on the first floor.

1:24:17.253 --> 1:24:21.323
I mean, we do it temporarily
if someone isn't feeling well.

1:24:21.323 --> 1:24:24.827
But if they progress
too far,

1:24:24.827 --> 1:24:29.064
we have to consider
moving upstairs.

1:24:30.332 --> 1:24:32.401
[sigh]

1:24:32.401 --> 1:24:35.371
Do you happen to have
Aubrey's address?

1:24:35.371 --> 1:24:37.072
I'm sorry?

1:24:40.075 --> 1:24:43.712
Aubrey and his wife.

1:24:43.712 --> 1:24:46.248
Where do they live?

1:25:03.232 --> 1:25:04.633
[Marian]
Well, it was
probably a mistake

1:25:04.633 --> 1:25:07.236
putting him there
in the first place,

1:25:07.236 --> 1:25:09.438
but I wasn't going
to get another chance

1:25:09.438 --> 1:25:12.508
to get away,
so I took it.

1:25:12.508 --> 1:25:13.742
Well, so...

1:25:15.544 --> 1:25:17.446
[chuckles]
Now I know better.

1:25:20.850 --> 1:25:23.385
Did your husband ever
work in a hardware store

1:25:23.385 --> 1:25:25.588
in the summers
when he was going to school?

1:25:25.588 --> 1:25:29.425
No, I never heard
about that.

1:25:29.425 --> 1:25:31.293
But I wasn't raised here.

1:25:32.728 --> 1:25:36.265
No. I didn't think so.

1:25:43.405 --> 1:25:46.809
Thank you very much
for your time, Miriam.

1:25:46.809 --> 1:25:50.446
It's Marian.

1:25:50.446 --> 1:25:51.614
Sorry.

1:25:59.355 --> 1:26:01.357
[sigh]

1:26:01.357 --> 1:26:03.492
What a jerk.

1:26:09.565 --> 1:26:10.533
Hmm.

1:26:13.168 --> 1:26:15.304
[car engine starts]

1:26:22.945 --> 1:26:24.947
Yeah, maybe someone
could just drop in on her,

1:26:24.947 --> 1:26:26.482
like, if the nurse
is around.

1:26:26.482 --> 1:26:28.884
All right.

1:26:28.884 --> 1:26:30.686
No, I don't think
there's much to it,

1:26:30.686 --> 1:26:32.555
but I'd like you
to call me back.

1:26:32.555 --> 1:26:34.456
Okay.

1:26:34.456 --> 1:26:36.792
Thanks a lot. Bye-bye.

1:26:36.792 --> 1:26:38.427
Hey.
Hi.

1:26:38.427 --> 1:26:39.962
[punching keypad]

1:26:39.962 --> 1:26:43.399
Uh...

1:26:43.399 --> 1:26:47.836
I think I want to ask you
about the second floor,

1:26:47.836 --> 1:26:51.407
just to know
a little more about it.

1:26:51.407 --> 1:26:53.509
Well, it's for people
who've really lost it.

1:27:00.816 --> 1:27:03.519
What do they do, then?

1:27:03.519 --> 1:27:08.324
What happens after that?
After they've...lost it?

1:27:08.324 --> 1:27:10.426
You don't really
want to know.

1:27:10.426 --> 1:27:12.494
But, you know,
sometimes they get it back.

1:27:12.494 --> 1:27:15.431
They go into their room
for a year, they don't
know you from Adam,

1:27:15.431 --> 1:27:17.666
and then one day,
it's, "Oh, hi.
When are we going home?"

1:27:17.666 --> 1:27:20.269
I mean, all of a sudden,
they're back to normal.

1:27:20.269 --> 1:27:22.004
But it doesn't
last for long.

1:27:22.004 --> 1:27:23.806
You think,
"Oh, wow, back to normal,"

1:27:23.806 --> 1:27:25.608
and then they're gone again--

1:27:25.608 --> 1:27:27.543
[snaps fingers]
like so.

1:27:30.446 --> 1:27:33.549
I haven't even asked you
about yourself.

1:27:33.549 --> 1:27:34.950
You married?

1:27:34.950 --> 1:27:38.854
Well, technically,
yeah, I guess.

1:27:38.854 --> 1:27:40.923
Got three kids.

1:27:40.923 --> 1:27:43.525
Their dad lives
in Alberta, I think.

1:27:43.525 --> 1:27:45.728
He's making it rich, maybe.
I wouldn't know.

1:27:45.728 --> 1:27:48.364
Must be quite a struggle.

1:27:48.364 --> 1:27:52.301
It, uh...knocks the wind
out of you every now and then,

1:27:52.301 --> 1:27:55.571
but you just pick yourself
back up like everyone else.

1:27:57.439 --> 1:28:01.343
I suppose our lives
must seem easy to you.

1:28:01.343 --> 1:28:04.613
We got through life
without too much
going wrong.

1:28:04.613 --> 1:28:08.417
What we have to suffer
now, when we're old,

1:28:08.417 --> 1:28:10.019
hardly counts,
I suppose.

1:28:10.019 --> 1:28:12.588
That's
what you must think.

1:28:16.492 --> 1:28:18.861
Well, how would you
know what I think?

1:28:18.861 --> 1:28:20.763
To tell you the truth,
I'd rather be

1:28:20.763 --> 1:28:24.566
the one that stayed
than the one that left.

1:28:24.566 --> 1:28:26.902
I'll bet you weren't always
the doggedly devoted husband.

1:28:26.902 --> 1:28:29.571
Am I right?

1:28:29.571 --> 1:28:33.042
I mean, you said
that you wondered

1:28:33.042 --> 1:28:37.646
if maybe she was punishing
you for something?

1:28:37.646 --> 1:28:39.915
I'll bet you had something
pretty specific in mind,
didn't you?

1:28:42.918 --> 1:28:48.791
You know, you see a lot
of things in this job.

1:28:48.791 --> 1:28:51.593
You see the end of things
all day long.

1:28:51.593 --> 1:28:53.495
And in my experience,
at the end of things

1:28:53.495 --> 1:28:55.330
it's almost always
the men that think

1:28:55.330 --> 1:28:58.600
that not too much
went wrong.

1:28:58.600 --> 1:29:00.836
I wonder if your wife
feels the same way.

1:29:02.871 --> 1:29:04.740
I wonder that, too.

1:29:06.075 --> 1:29:08.510
I bet you do.

[Marian]
Uh, hello, Grant.

1:29:34.436 --> 1:29:36.638
I hope I got
the right person.

1:29:36.638 --> 1:29:38.507
I just thought of something.

1:29:38.507 --> 1:29:40.676
There is a dance
here in town

1:29:40.676 --> 1:29:42.878
at the Legion
on Saturday night,

1:29:42.878 --> 1:29:44.646
and I am
on the supper committee,

1:29:44.646 --> 1:29:46.849
which means I can
bring a free guest.

1:29:46.849 --> 1:29:49.551
So I wondered
whether you would happen

1:29:49.551 --> 1:29:51.687
to be interested in that.

1:29:51.687 --> 1:29:54.089
Call me back
when you get a chance.

1:29:54.089 --> 1:29:57.826
555-3457.

1:29:57.826 --> 1:29:59.628

1:29:59.628 --> 1:30:01.530
[answering machine beeps]

1:30:01.530 --> 1:30:04.433
[Marian]
I just realizedI'd forgotten
to say who it was.

1:30:04.433 --> 1:30:05.667
[chuckles]

1:30:05.667 --> 1:30:08.804
Well, you probably recognize
the voice, the accent.

1:30:08.804 --> 1:30:10.472
It's Marian.

1:30:10.472 --> 1:30:12.775
I'm still not so used
to these machines,

1:30:12.775 --> 1:30:15.544
and I wanted to say
I realize you're not single

1:30:15.544 --> 1:30:17.646
and I don't mean it
that way.

1:30:17.646 --> 1:30:19.515
I'm not, either.

1:30:19.515 --> 1:30:22.651
But it doesn't hurt
to get out once in a while.

1:30:22.651 --> 1:30:24.920
Anyway,
now I've said all this,

1:30:24.920 --> 1:30:27.589
I really hope
it's you I'm talking to.

1:30:27.589 --> 1:30:29.691
It did sound like your voice.

1:30:29.691 --> 1:30:31.894
If you're interested,
you can call me.

1:30:31.894 --> 1:30:34.963
And if you are not,
you don't need to bother.

1:30:34.963 --> 1:30:39.568
I just thought you might
like the chance to get out.

1:30:39.568 --> 1:30:41.203
It's Marian speaking.

1:30:41.203 --> 1:30:43.138
[chuckling]

1:30:43.138 --> 1:30:46.608
I guess I already said that.

1:30:46.608 --> 1:30:49.745
Okay, then.
Good-bye.

1:30:53.749 --> 1:30:55.751
[Grant]
"The desires of the heart

1:30:55.751 --> 1:30:58.086
"are as crooked
as corkscrews.

1:30:58.086 --> 1:31:00.756
"Not to be born

1:31:00.756 --> 1:31:04.193
"The second-best

The dance's pattern:
dance while you can."

1:31:13.836 --> 1:31:16.939
Fiona?

1:31:16.939 --> 1:31:19.942
Is there any way
to let this go...

1:31:19.942 --> 1:31:21.944
do you think?

1:31:26.181 --> 1:31:29.685
If I let it go,
it'll only hit me harder

1:31:29.685 --> 1:31:31.954
when I bump into it again.

1:31:37.226 --> 1:31:38.827
Okay.

1:31:43.699 --> 1:31:46.835
"Dance, dance,
for the figure is easy.

1:31:46.835 --> 1:31:50.639

Hello, Marian.

1:32:20.202 --> 1:32:21.770
So...

1:32:23.906 --> 1:32:25.574
There you are.

1:32:26.775 --> 1:32:28.777
Here I am.

1:32:59.107 --> 1:33:00.776
What are you thinking?

1:33:02.744 --> 1:33:04.780
Not an awful lot, really.

1:33:06.782 --> 1:33:08.917
Skiing.

1:33:12.187 --> 1:33:13.255
Downhill?

1:33:15.824 --> 1:33:16.892
Cross-country.

1:33:19.828 --> 1:33:23.332
I'm more a thrill-seeker,
I guess.

1:33:28.904 --> 1:33:30.072
What are you thinking?

1:33:31.907 --> 1:33:33.608
I'm thinking
you never know

1:33:33.608 --> 1:33:36.078
how things are going
to turn out.

1:33:38.914 --> 1:33:42.184
You almost know...

1:33:42.184 --> 1:33:46.121
but you can never
be quite sure.

1:34:22.257 --> 1:34:23.992
Mr. Andersson?

1:34:30.799 --> 1:34:32.801
Mr. Andersson?

1:34:32.801 --> 1:34:34.903
Now, as you know,
we're, uh,

1:34:34.903 --> 1:34:36.338
we're going to have to
think about moving

1:34:36.338 --> 1:34:40.042
Mrs. Andersson upstairs
fairly soon, I'm afraid.

1:34:40.042 --> 1:34:42.377
She hasn't been
out of that bed
for two weeks now, and--

1:34:42.377 --> 1:34:46.048
I'm quite aware
of your policies.

1:34:46.048 --> 1:34:48.183
I'm more than aware
of your bloody policies.

1:34:50.986 --> 1:34:53.922
[Frank]
Well, once again,
Nurse Kristy is taking me

1:34:53.922 --> 1:34:55.223
back to the second floor.

1:34:55.223 --> 1:34:57.159
The area to my right
are the elevators,

1:34:57.159 --> 1:34:59.194
and as we go on
down the hall,

1:34:59.194 --> 1:35:01.096
there's a man
with a broken heart,

1:35:01.096 --> 1:35:02.931
broken
in a thousand pieces.

1:35:02.931 --> 1:35:05.233
Well, we'll go
to Madeleine's office,
past the lunchroom.

1:35:05.233 --> 1:35:07.202
Hopefully,
they're serving right now.

1:35:07.202 --> 1:35:08.837
The cannelloni
was cold yesterday,

1:35:08.837 --> 1:35:10.205
but let's see
what it's doing today.

1:35:10.205 --> 1:35:12.207
Let's have-- I gotta have
some Cokes again.

1:35:12.207 --> 1:35:14.242
That's what I'm
going to do.

1:35:17.012 --> 1:35:21.883
Wouldn't it be better
if...

1:35:21.883 --> 1:35:24.853
when we go out again,

1:35:24.853 --> 1:35:27.456
to put Aubrey
back into Meadowlake?

1:35:27.456 --> 1:35:29.958
Just for a day?

1:35:29.958 --> 1:35:31.993
What do you think?

1:35:34.896 --> 1:35:39.868
I'm thinking
that sometimes you...

1:35:39.868 --> 1:35:44.406
just have to make
the decision to be happy.

1:35:46.975 --> 1:35:48.743
Just decide.

1:35:50.345 --> 1:35:53.982
Things aren't ever
what you hoped they'd be.

1:35:53.982 --> 1:35:55.884
Not ever, for anybody.

1:35:57.786 --> 1:35:59.187
The only thing
that separates

1:35:59.187 --> 1:36:01.456
one kind of person
from another

1:36:01.456 --> 1:36:05.460
is there are some
who stay angry about it

1:36:05.460 --> 1:36:09.097
and there
are some who...

1:36:09.097 --> 1:36:11.466
accept
what comes their way.

1:36:13.101 --> 1:36:14.503
And which kind
of person are you?

1:36:16.037 --> 1:36:19.474
I was pretty mad
about it.

1:36:19.474 --> 1:36:22.544
But now...

1:36:22.544 --> 1:36:27.382
looking at what
came my way...

1:36:32.087 --> 1:36:35.023
I think I could be
the other kind of person.

1:36:38.026 --> 1:36:40.495
Quite the philosopher,
huh?

1:36:43.965 --> 1:36:45.467
Look, why don't you
pull over here?

1:36:45.467 --> 1:36:49.871
Just...
pull over, could you?

1:37:00.882 --> 1:37:03.151
Ahem.

1:37:05.554 --> 1:37:07.222
I know what you're doing.

1:37:09.024 --> 1:37:12.227
It would be easier for me

1:37:12.227 --> 1:37:14.095
if you could pretend
a little.

1:37:15.564 --> 1:37:17.899
Do you think
you could do that?

1:37:32.914 --> 1:37:35.550
Now, what were
we talking about?

1:38:21.162 --> 1:38:22.998
She was the only one
in her family

1:38:22.998 --> 1:38:24.199
who bothered to learn
sign language.

1:38:25.667 --> 1:38:30.238
Now she can't remember how,
or maybe even who she is.

1:38:30.238 --> 1:38:31.539
Her daughter?

1:38:31.539 --> 1:38:33.308
Yeah.

1:38:33.308 --> 1:38:36.211
It's left her
pretty stranded.

1:38:36.211 --> 1:38:38.246
Marooned.

1:38:40.282 --> 1:38:42.150
You know,
I thought of you
the other day.

1:38:42.150 --> 1:38:44.052
You know that billboard
out in front

1:38:44.052 --> 1:38:45.320
of the United Church
in Bradford,

1:38:45.320 --> 1:38:48.957
they post all that
biblical-type stuff?

1:38:48.957 --> 1:38:52.260
The other day, it said,

1:38:52.260 --> 1:38:53.662
"It's never too late

1:38:53.662 --> 1:38:55.297
to become what you
might have been."

1:38:57.565 --> 1:39:01.369
Doesn't sound
all that biblical.

1:39:01.369 --> 1:39:03.972
Well, maybe they're
getting creative on us.

1:39:23.425 --> 1:39:25.126

1:39:46.748 --> 1:39:48.116

1:40:30.692 --> 1:40:33.161
See you soon, Aubrey.

1:41:14.436 --> 1:41:16.504
Oh, yeah.

1:41:16.504 --> 1:41:17.672
Thanks.

1:41:32.754 --> 1:41:34.222
Thanks.

1:42:29.244 --> 1:42:31.312
Would you mind
if I had a moment alone

1:42:31.312 --> 1:42:32.780
before you come in?

1:42:34.249 --> 1:42:36.351
To explain things to her?

1:42:52.367 --> 1:42:56.371
I found this beautiful book
about Iceland.

1:42:56.371 --> 1:42:59.440
You wouldn't think
they'd leave valuable books
lying around.

1:42:59.440 --> 1:43:03.545
People who stay here
aren't all necessarily honest.

1:43:04.846 --> 1:43:09.751
And I think they got
the clothes mixed up.

1:43:09.751 --> 1:43:12.453
I never wear yellow.

1:43:20.695 --> 1:43:23.765
I seem to remember you
reading this to me.

1:43:26.234 --> 1:43:28.570
You were trying
to make me feel better.

1:43:30.872 --> 1:43:33.474
You tried so hard.

1:43:37.278 --> 1:43:39.480
You're a lovely man,
you know?

1:43:40.815 --> 1:43:44.419

Do you remember Aubrey?

1:44:20.922 --> 1:44:23.291
Names elude me.

1:44:35.837 --> 1:44:38.640
I'm happy to see you.

1:44:43.478 --> 1:44:46.447
You could've
just driven away.

1:44:46.447 --> 1:44:51.719
Just driven away
without a care in the world

1:44:51.719 --> 1:44:54.322
and forsook me.

1:44:56.457 --> 1:44:58.626
Forsooken me.

Forsaken.
