1:06:18.750 --> 1:06:20.708

1:06:24.375 --> 1:06:26.541

1:08:50.666 --> 1:08:54.166
without having my ears to the ground

and my ears tell me you just lost
25 thou that was coming your way.

1:09:00.541 --> 1:09:02.583
[Trudy] I hope your proposal
rivals your nerve--

1:09:02.666 --> 1:09:05.250
Allow me the latitude of completion.

1:09:09.083 --> 1:09:11.166
My saloon in Douglas is boomin'.

1:09:11.708 --> 1:09:14.875
Bought me another one in the Elks,
and I got a restaurant in Cascade too.

1:09:15.458 --> 1:09:18.083
For the sum of all that,
I could take this one off your hands.

1:09:42.333 --> 1:09:48.666
You walkin' into my town
with that proposal is risky.

1:09:49.625 --> 1:09:54.083

wouldn't tie herself to

a whole lot more at stake.

1:10:01.708 --> 1:10:03.083

1:11:15.666 --> 1:11:16.541
All right.

1:11:20.041 --> 1:11:22.958
So you still sayin'
you don't know nothin' about that money

1:11:23.041 --> 1:11:24.500
and you done come here alone?

1:11:26.000 --> 1:11:26.916
That's right.

1:11:27.833 --> 1:11:31.041
You done rode all the way over here
to get yourself killed.

1:11:31.833 --> 1:11:32.875
And for what?

1:11:33.875 --> 1:11:34.708
For love?

1:11:35.833 --> 1:11:38.166
Love is the only thing worth dying for.

1:11:40.000 --> 1:11:42.125
But you wouldn't know anything about that.

1:11:48.083 --> 1:11:49.083
You know,

1:11:50.291 --> 1:11:52.166
I had a sister named Mary.

1:11:58.583 --> 1:12:03.291
She was pretty, strong-willed, like you.

1:12:05.833 --> 1:12:07.375
She died of polio when I was 11.

1:12:09.541 --> 1:12:12.958
Always was in pain,
but she'd never let me see her cry.

1:12:13.916 --> 1:12:14.750
Mmm.

1:12:16.708 --> 1:12:19.750
There's this girl called Hope lived by us.

1:12:20.750 --> 1:12:24.083
Big fat kid,
always picking on the smaller kids.

1:12:24.833 --> 1:12:26.625
Obviously out of jealousy.

1:12:27.833 --> 1:12:29.666
But she ain't never fuck with me though.

1:12:31.500 --> 1:12:33.416
She hated Mary with a passion,

1:12:34.250 --> 1:12:38.583
always teasing her
about how thin and frail she was.

1:12:39.791 --> 1:12:41.083
Then one day,

1:12:42.125 --> 1:12:44.583
Hope walkin' by our house,

1:12:45.250 --> 1:12:48.000
apple in one hand, blade in the other.

1:12:50.583 --> 1:12:54.083
She decided to throw the apple
across the street at Mary,

1:12:55.291 --> 1:12:59.208
and it hit my sister in the head
and knocked her out of balance.

1:12:59.291 --> 1:13:00.875
She fell down the steps.

1:13:03.000 --> 1:13:04.291
Broke her ankle.

1:13:05.500 --> 1:13:06.500
And now that…

1:13:07.666 --> 1:13:11.666
that was the first and only time
I physically seen my sister cry.

1:13:13.625 --> 1:13:17.791
And there was Hope standing there
laughin' her ugly fuckin' face off.

1:13:21.833 --> 1:13:22.833
My daddy…

1:13:25.958 --> 1:13:27.333
he got home,

1:13:29.166 --> 1:13:34.041
he took off his belt, and he beat me
for not protecting my sister.

1:13:36.125 --> 1:13:39.208
He lashed me
until my whole body went numb.

1:13:42.166 --> 1:13:43.083
Then

1:13:44.291 --> 1:13:47.125
he went to Hope house
to do the same thing to her.

1:13:49.333 --> 1:13:54.166
When he got there, he saw her whole family
standin' on the side of the house,

1:13:54.250 --> 1:13:56.583
all of 'em screamin' and cryin',

1:13:58.666 --> 1:13:59.958
and there was Hope…

1:14:02.250 --> 1:14:04.458
lyin' on the floor in a pool of blood.

1:14:06.250 --> 1:14:09.208
Somebody had slit her throat.

1:14:10.583 --> 1:14:12.125
Killed her with her own knife.

1:14:16.916 --> 1:14:19.041
Daddy was speechless.

1:14:19.791 --> 1:14:22.708
He ain't said a word to me
when he came home.

1:14:24.333 --> 1:14:25.458
The next day,

1:14:26.583 --> 1:14:28.791
he sent me to live with my grandparents.

1:14:30.375 --> 1:14:32.875
And then the next time I seen my sister,

1:14:34.291 --> 1:14:36.208
she was laying in a coffin.

1:14:38.375 --> 1:14:39.875
Disease had killed her.

1:14:47.125 --> 1:14:49.458
I'm sorry your sister had to suffer.

1:14:53.833 --> 1:14:55.666
I admire her bravery.

1:14:59.375 --> 1:15:01.625
But you get no words from me.

1:15:04.666 --> 1:15:05.541

1:15:06.458 --> 1:15:08.958
I actually admire your bravery.

1:15:13.250 --> 1:15:15.666

is still the outcome.
