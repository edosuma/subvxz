WEBVTT

02:49.461 --> 02:53.011
I give it to you without the hoopla,
Danny Boy, the simple facts of life.

02:53.131 --> 02:55.008
I'm sitting on a crossfire,
with the cops on one side,

02:55.133 --> 02:58.683
Smiley Freeman on the other,
and the both of them gunning for me.

02:58.804 --> 03:01.081
So, I'm the guy who knows
that you're the one

03:01.181 --> 03:04.936
who took the 20 grand from Smiley
to cover up the dirk and kill him.

03:05.060 --> 03:07.279
Got a cigarette, Danny Boy?

03:07.604 --> 03:10.198
Now, my proposition's
quick and easy, Danny.

03:10.357 --> 03:15.534
We split the 20. Five for you,
fifteen for me, and I take it on the lam.

03:15.654 --> 03:18.658
Live and let live's my motto.

03:20.075 --> 03:24.029
Ah, that look in your eye,
Danny, is painful to my pride.

03:26.748 --> 03:29.217
Danny Boy, don't kill me.

03:29.334 --> 03:31.553
Danny Boy, don't!

04:01.575 --> 04:04.875
Hey, what happened? What's going on
down there? Were those shots?

04:04.995 --> 04:07.373
You'd better call the police.
There's been a murder.

04:23.096 --> 04:24.973
- Evening, Inspector.
- Hi.

04:25.098 --> 04:26.520
Hi, boys.

04:26.641 --> 04:28.188
Always happens in the middle of the night.

04:28.310 --> 04:30.358
Yeah.

04:31.396 --> 04:33.615
- That's Joe Gordon all right.
- Yeah.

04:33.732 --> 04:36.110
He won't be doing much testifying now.

04:36.234 --> 04:39.204
- Convenient for Smiley Freeman.
- Yeah.

04:39.321 --> 04:41.574
Peddler, over there with a dog,
says he saw it.

04:41.698 --> 04:44.451
Yeah?

04:44.576 --> 04:46.578
- Stenographer here yet?
- Not yet, Inspector.

04:46.703 --> 04:47.704
What's this guy's name?

04:47.829 --> 04:52.426
Frank Johnson. Lives around here.
Claimed he was out walking his dog.

04:52.751 --> 04:54.753
Hi, Mr. Johnson.

04:54.878 --> 04:57.722
Inspector Ferris, homicide detail.

04:57.839 --> 05:00.012
- Understand you had a front seat.
- I sure did.

05:00.133 --> 05:02.035
- Get a good look at the killer?
- Too good.

05:02.135 --> 05:05.205
That street light was right on his face,
when he got out of his car and shot at me.

05:05.305 --> 05:07.148
- Shot at you?
- Twice.

05:07.265 --> 05:08.938
You're lucky he missed.

05:09.059 --> 05:11.687
Think you'd recognize him,
you saw him again?

05:11.812 --> 05:14.531
That's not a face I'm likely to forget.

05:14.648 --> 05:15.688
Pick him out of a line-up?

05:15.774 --> 05:19.745
I think so, yeah.
Say, what's this all about anyway?

05:19.861 --> 05:21.613
The dead man, Joe Gordon,

05:21.738 --> 05:24.742
was going to testify before
the grand jury next week.

05:24.866 --> 05:26.334
- That's tough.
- Not too.

05:26.451 --> 05:28.829
He had a bad record. He knew
too much about Smiley Freeman.

05:28.954 --> 05:31.173
- You know who Smiley Freeman is?
- The gangster?

05:31.289 --> 05:35.294
That's right. Gordon was our witness.
Now you're it.

05:35.418 --> 05:36.715
- Me?
- Yeah.

05:36.837 --> 05:41.058
All you have to do is identify
the killer. We'll do the rest.

05:41.299 --> 05:43.393
- Married?
- In a way.

05:44.761 --> 05:47.935
What do you mean "in a way"?
Are you or aren't you?

05:48.056 --> 05:49.603
Yeah, I am.

05:49.724 --> 05:51.397
- Where do you live?
- Right over there.

05:51.518 --> 05:54.021
136 Alta Linda, apartment 4D.

05:54.145 --> 05:56.523
- Pick up Mrs. Johnson. Bring her here.
- OK.

05:56.648 --> 05:59.743
Hey, don't wake her up!
She's not gonna like it.

05:59.860 --> 06:02.989
Well, she'll want to know
where you are, won't she?

06:03.113 --> 06:04.911
We're taking you down to headquarters.

06:05.031 --> 06:07.454
Headquarters? What for?

06:08.910 --> 06:12.005
- Protective custody.
- I see what you mean.

06:12.122 --> 06:13.624
Now, where were you standing
when he shot at you?

06:13.748 --> 06:16.376
- Oh, right down there.
- Show me.

06:18.044 --> 06:20.968
Well, I was right down there with
the dog when the car drove up.

06:21.089 --> 06:24.263
I didn't pay much attention to it.
Little bit later, I heard a shot.

06:24.384 --> 06:26.478
I looked up just in time to see
this fellow, whatshisname,

06:26.595 --> 06:28.063
fall out of the car.

06:28.179 --> 06:30.728
Then the killer pumped
another shot right into him.

06:30.849 --> 06:35.525
My dog barked. He got out of the car,
started to shoot at me.

06:35.645 --> 06:37.022
I ducked and he drove away.

06:37.147 --> 06:39.382
- What kind of a car?
- I don't know. A light coupe.

06:39.482 --> 06:41.701
They all look alike to me.

06:42.319 --> 06:46.324
Well, his aim was all right. He was
just shooting at the wrong target.

06:46.448 --> 06:48.496
He thought your shadow was you.

06:53.330 --> 06:55.628
Will you go call Reardon?

06:55.749 --> 06:58.343
- Maybe he won't miss next time.
- There won't be any next time.

06:58.460 --> 07:00.660
Yeah, but suppose you don't
get a conviction. Then what?

07:00.754 --> 07:03.194
Do I have to spend the rest of my life
with police protection?

07:03.256 --> 07:05.224
Or wind up on a sidewalk like him?

07:05.342 --> 07:07.561
What are you worried about?
He missed, didn't he?

07:07.677 --> 07:10.851
Stay here a minute. We'll get
the rest of the story downtown.

07:13.850 --> 07:15.272
I hate to get mixed up in this.

07:15.393 --> 07:19.273
Yeah, it's getting so a man has to be
careful where he's looking these days.

07:19.397 --> 07:22.025
- Take it easy.
- Keep out of here, will you?

07:22.150 --> 07:23.948
Say, I think I dropped my pipe
somewhere around here.

07:24.069 --> 07:25.195
Is it OK if I look for it?

07:25.320 --> 07:27.914
- Remember where you had it last?
- Yeah, it was over here somewhere.

07:28.031 --> 07:30.250
What's the matter, bud?

07:30.367 --> 07:33.246
Come on! Get out of here, will you?

07:40.043 --> 07:42.421
Pick up Smiley Freeman
and everybody connected with him.

07:42.545 --> 07:45.765
Put him in a line-up.
See if Johnson can identify anybody.

07:45.882 --> 07:48.305
I want everybody. No excuses, no lawyers.

07:48.426 --> 07:50.019
- I want everybody.
- Will do.

07:50.136 --> 07:54.266
See if you can pick up anything on
that car. Somebody may have seen it.

08:00.021 --> 08:02.615
Mrs. Johnson, that's not your husband.

08:02.732 --> 08:06.782
The man was killed. He saw it happen.
He... he's right over here.

08:06.903 --> 08:09.873
Sorry I had to get you out of bed,
Mrs. Johnson.

08:09.990 --> 08:13.210
But, after all, we had to
make sure that he had a wife.

08:16.329 --> 08:18.002
- Where is he?
- He took a powder.

08:18.123 --> 08:20.171
Sergeant, pick up Johnson.
Idiot will get himself killed.

08:20.291 --> 08:21.318
Get down there and cover the park!

08:21.418 --> 08:23.320
Just like him, always running away.

08:23.420 --> 08:25.047
What do you mean, "always running away"?

08:25.171 --> 08:27.265
- Running away from what?
- From everything.

08:27.382 --> 08:29.976
Broadcast a description.
White male American.

08:30.093 --> 08:32.061
Wears a trench coat, soft brown hat.

08:32.178 --> 08:34.897
A very ordinary-looking feller,
I'm afraid.

08:35.015 --> 08:38.019
Yeah. Well, how would you describe
your husband, Mrs. Johnson?

08:38.143 --> 08:41.943
I couldn't. I haven't been
able to for a long time.

08:42.063 --> 08:44.486
May I go now? Come on, you mutt.

08:45.984 --> 08:48.533
- Nice dish, huh?
- Nice-looking dish.

08:48.653 --> 08:52.283
I want everything shut off.
Bridge controls, roadblocks, everything.

08:52.407 --> 08:53.954
- I'll stick with her.
- Right.

08:56.494 --> 08:57.654
Did you hear the shots fired?

08:57.662 --> 09:00.541
How could I? I was in bed, sound asleep.

09:00.665 --> 09:01.666
Find any pictures of him?

09:01.791 --> 09:04.419
No, but plenty of her.
Just some tired snaps of him.

09:04.544 --> 09:08.765
Hm, they won't do anybody any good.
But keep 'em.

09:11.134 --> 09:16.391
Reads books on psychology.
I wonder why. Has he got a problem?

09:16.514 --> 09:18.733
I wouldn't know.

09:19.017 --> 09:21.770
Maybe he's confused. Aren't we all?

09:23.688 --> 09:25.782
Pipe smoker? Hm.

09:25.899 --> 09:28.493
- What does that mean?
- Nothing.

09:32.405 --> 09:36.160
Oh, he's got two suits,
one of which he's wearing.

09:36.284 --> 09:38.036
Well, what does he care
what he looks like?

09:38.161 --> 09:41.290
Nobody pays any attention to him
anyway. Not even his wife.

09:41.414 --> 09:43.007
You're really wasting your time.

09:43.124 --> 09:45.377
There must be at least
20,000 men in San Francisco

09:45.502 --> 09:47.129
who answer that description.

09:47.253 --> 09:48.470
How are you going to find him?

09:48.588 --> 09:50.508
There'd have to be something
different about him.

09:50.548 --> 09:52.050
Different, anyway, from other people.

09:52.175 --> 09:53.301
There is something different about him.

09:53.426 --> 09:54.894
There's something different
about everybody,

09:55.011 --> 09:57.480
and we're gonna dig
until we find out what it is.

09:57.597 --> 10:00.100
Now you see our problem, Mrs.
Johnson. Why won't you help us?

10:00.225 --> 10:01.522
I'm helping. What do you want me to do?

10:01.643 --> 10:03.896
- I want you to answer a few questions.
- Go ahead, ask.

10:04.020 --> 10:06.114
Where does he generally go
when he's not at home?

10:06.231 --> 10:07.528
I haven't the faintest idea.

10:07.649 --> 10:09.697
- Has he any relatives in this area?
- No.

10:09.818 --> 10:11.778
- Who are his friends?
- I don't know his friends.

10:11.820 --> 10:13.367
The dog is our only mutual friend.

10:13.488 --> 10:15.411
You always go to sleep
when he walks the dog?

10:15.532 --> 10:18.456
No, sometimes he goes to sleep
and I walk the dog.

10:20.495 --> 10:22.918
Say, Inspector. Here are a couple of more.

10:23.998 --> 10:26.000
I'm terribly sorry.
There's been a mistake.

10:26.126 --> 10:28.470
Release these men at once.

10:28.586 --> 10:29.587
- Keep digging.
- OK.

10:29.712 --> 10:32.340
Every man between the ages of 35
and 40 who was out tonight

10:32.465 --> 10:35.093
is wearing a trench coat
and a snap-brim felt,

10:35.218 --> 10:37.892
all of them five foot 11, weighing 170,

10:38.012 --> 10:39.855
and all of them scared
to answer questions.

10:39.973 --> 10:42.053
The domestic situation in this town
must be terrible.

10:42.142 --> 10:44.770
Yeah. Kitchen?

10:44.894 --> 10:46.988
Well, it's got a stove in it.

10:53.695 --> 10:55.697
Hey.

11:01.703 --> 11:03.421
Don't you eat anything but dog food?

11:03.538 --> 11:06.132
He's not particular and I'm lazy
so we eat out.

11:06.249 --> 11:07.250
Where?

11:07.375 --> 11:09.469
Well, let's see: the corner drugstore,

11:09.586 --> 11:12.089
the lobster grill at the wharf
when we're in that neighborhood,

11:12.213 --> 11:15.342
and when we get real fancy,
Man Loh's Oriental Roof Garden.

11:15.466 --> 11:18.140
Those usually.
We're creatures of habit, I'm afraid.

11:18.261 --> 11:19.513
Check the Oriental Roof Garden.

11:19.637 --> 11:20.763
- They'll still be open.
- Yes, sir.

11:20.889 --> 11:23.187
It's two o'clock in the morning.
How am I gonna explain this at home?

11:23.308 --> 11:25.502
- What's going on here?
- I'm sorry. There's been a mistake.

11:25.602 --> 11:27.629
He's sorry? What am I gonna tell my wife?

11:27.729 --> 11:29.106
Come on.

11:31.983 --> 11:34.077
What did you and your husband
quarrel about tonight, Mrs. Johnson?

11:34.194 --> 11:35.787
We don't have to have a reason anymore.

11:35.904 --> 11:38.123
Don't you have a decent picture
of your husband?

11:38.239 --> 11:40.662
No, he doesn't like to
have his picture taken.

11:40.783 --> 11:42.330
I don't want any photographs
of him floating around

11:42.452 --> 11:43.453
that might get in the papers.

11:43.578 --> 11:44.955
The killer doesn't know
what he looks like.

11:45.079 --> 11:48.083
- Didn't he see him?
- No, he shot at his shadow.

11:48.208 --> 11:50.006
- Shot? He shot at Frank?
- Twice.

11:50.126 --> 11:52.299
Nobody knows that except the killer,
your husband, and now you.

11:52.420 --> 11:55.094
So, let's keep it that way.
It's important.

11:56.758 --> 11:58.055
He's really in danger, then?

11:58.176 --> 12:00.804
Worried? I thought you were
beyond worrying about him?

12:00.929 --> 12:02.852
I didn't say that.

12:02.972 --> 12:03.973
If he doesn't give himself up,

12:04.098 --> 12:06.647
you're really gonna have
something to worry about.

12:06.768 --> 12:08.020
We've got to protect him.

12:08.144 --> 12:09.771
Like you did the other witness?

12:09.896 --> 12:12.936
Joe Gordon would be alive right now,
if he hadn't had his lawyers spring him.

12:12.982 --> 12:16.236
Hey, Mark. Here's something,
prescription for Frank Johnson.

12:16.361 --> 12:18.784
- Husband ill?
- No, he just likes to take medicine.

12:18.905 --> 12:20.373
- Well, what are these for?
- I don't know.

12:20.490 --> 12:23.664
He just likes to take vitamin pills,
cold shots, anything.

12:27.580 --> 12:30.174
- What's up here?
- Studio. My husband's an artist.

12:30.291 --> 12:32.510
Oh, I thought you said he worked
at Hart & Winston's?

12:32.627 --> 12:35.380
He does. He's in charge
of displays down there.

12:35.505 --> 12:37.507
Oh, window trimmer, huh?

12:38.633 --> 12:42.638
Rembrandt, get down.
You know you're not allowed up there.

12:42.762 --> 12:43.888
Rembrandt?

12:44.013 --> 12:46.311
It's the nearest we could
ever get to owning one.

12:46.432 --> 12:47.775
- Frank's little joke.
- Oh.

12:47.892 --> 12:49.485
He found the mutt sitting
on the street corner one night,

12:49.602 --> 12:51.354
waiting for someone to adopt him.

12:51.479 --> 12:54.232
They recognized each other right away.

12:59.487 --> 13:00.784
Is this supposed to be you?

13:00.905 --> 13:05.957
Yes. It was a lovely autumn day.
The wind was blowing through my hair.

13:07.787 --> 13:10.085
It was all very charming,
but that was four years ago.

13:10.206 --> 13:11.958
That was Frank's Cypress period.

13:12.083 --> 13:14.427
He had four important periods
in his painting career.

13:16.045 --> 13:19.345
Say, how did you two ever happen
to get together in the first place?

13:19.465 --> 13:21.513
I met him at a friend's house in Carmel.

13:21.634 --> 13:23.762
He wanted to paint and I was all for it.

13:23.886 --> 13:28.312
I had 5,000 dollars and he had
2,000 and talent. So, we got married.

13:28.433 --> 13:30.026
After Carmel, he became restless

13:30.143 --> 13:33.613
so we went to Taos, New Mexico,
where he painted Indians.

13:33.730 --> 13:35.778
- That's an Indian.
- Yeah.

13:35.898 --> 13:37.275
Then he got tired of Indians.

13:37.400 --> 13:39.080
So, we went to Bucks County, Pennsylvania,

13:39.193 --> 13:42.117
where he painted old Dutch barns
with hex signs on them.

13:42.238 --> 13:45.663
- Say, did he ever do a self-portrait?
- He didn't like himself that much.

13:45.783 --> 13:47.160
Oh.

13:48.536 --> 13:50.880
He do these in Pennsylvania?

13:50.997 --> 13:54.251
No, he got restless again
so we came to San Francisco.

13:54.375 --> 13:56.255
Here he studies, sketching
crummy old characters

13:56.377 --> 13:58.880
that hung around wharfs,
missions and gin mills.

13:59.005 --> 14:01.474
That was his social protest period.

14:01.591 --> 14:04.310
Then our money ran out
and he had to take a job.

14:04.427 --> 14:06.100
- Couldn't sell the stuff, huh?
- He wouldn't try to sell it.

14:06.220 --> 14:07.517
Didn't think it was good enough.

14:07.638 --> 14:10.718
These sketchbooks are filled with great
ideas he never got around to painting.

14:10.808 --> 14:12.685
Didn't you try to get a job?

14:12.810 --> 14:15.814
Why should I?
That's his responsibility, not mine.

14:17.440 --> 14:19.442
Friend of your husband's?

14:19.567 --> 14:21.365
No, that's his burlesque period.

14:21.486 --> 14:23.864
Now, that I like. It's pretty good.

14:23.988 --> 14:26.332
Yes, but it takes more than talent
to have a career.

14:26.449 --> 14:28.122
You have to have staying power.

14:28.242 --> 14:30.722
Frank's a drifter. So, when
the money ran out, we just drifted.

14:31.829 --> 14:32.830
Who's this?

14:32.955 --> 14:35.629
Oh, some dance team over in Chinatown.

14:35.750 --> 14:36.876
Oh.

14:39.712 --> 14:40.838
Know him?

14:40.963 --> 14:44.968
Oh, he's a retired ferryboat captain
who does sand sculptures at the beach.

14:45.093 --> 14:49.143
Oh, I know who that is. That's Rembrandt.

14:49.263 --> 14:51.482
What has all this got to do
with finding Frank?

14:51.599 --> 14:54.773
You just answer the questions.
That is, if it doesn't hurt.

14:54.894 --> 14:57.488
Why should it hurt me?
It's all past and done with.

14:57.605 --> 15:00.999
If you want to snoop into the remains
of our marriage, that's up to you.

15:03.319 --> 15:05.242
Don't touch that telephone!

15:05.363 --> 15:09.334
If that's your husband,
find out where he is, but keep on talking.

15:25.258 --> 15:26.510
- Hello?
- 'Hello.'

15:26.634 --> 15:28.807
- Oh, hello, Frank.
- Trace that call.

15:28.928 --> 15:30.521
'Eleanor, there's something
I want you to get for me.'

15:30.638 --> 15:32.811
I'm sorry to interrupt,
but if I were you, I'd hang up.

15:32.932 --> 15:35.185
The police are tracing your call.

15:36.477 --> 15:38.605
Hello? Hello?

15:38.729 --> 15:41.699
He hung up. Seems to me, I heard music.

15:41.816 --> 15:43.818
Wasn't there music?

15:44.735 --> 15:46.954
You didn't do your husband
a favor, Mrs. Johnson.

15:47.071 --> 15:49.790
It's bad enough to be alone
in a big city, with no place to go.

15:49.907 --> 15:51.159
But as soon as the newspapers
hit the streets,

15:51.284 --> 15:53.628
and the killer finds out
he didn't get your husband,

15:53.744 --> 15:55.997
there'll be guys looking for him
with guns.

15:56.122 --> 15:59.672
If I had a husband I wanted to get
rid of, I'd do exactly what you did.

15:59.792 --> 16:01.590
If he wants to run away,
that's his business.

16:01.711 --> 16:04.681
And your business too, Mrs. Johnson.

16:04.797 --> 16:06.765
I'll be seeing you.

16:11.846 --> 16:14.440
No wonder the world's full of bachelors.

16:16.809 --> 16:18.607
Little more needling's all she needs.

16:18.728 --> 16:20.275
Give her plenty of rope
and keep her tailed.

16:20.396 --> 16:21.648
She wants to get rid of him.

16:21.772 --> 16:24.133
Women are curious.
Even that dame will go after him.

16:24.233 --> 16:25.593
Come on, be a good feller and let us up...

16:25.693 --> 16:27.036
- Who's handling the case?
- Inspector Ferris.

16:27.153 --> 16:28.621
Oh, he's a friend of mine.

16:28.738 --> 16:30.832
- Is that right, Inspector?
- Sure, we know him well.

16:30.948 --> 16:32.950
- Hi, Ferris. What's the dope?
- No story.

16:33.075 --> 16:35.077
How about that Johnson gal?
Is she good-looking?

16:35.203 --> 16:37.752
- What about the witness?
- What witness?

16:37.872 --> 16:40.216
Oh, cut it out, cut it out.
It's already going to press.

16:40.333 --> 16:42.085
- Did you get a look at the murderer?
- No.

16:42.210 --> 16:44.178
What's his wife like? Any filth?

16:44.295 --> 16:46.969
Lay off the tabloid sex stuff, Legget.

16:47.089 --> 16:49.057
I'll give it to all of you in the morning.

16:49.175 --> 16:51.769
- Hiya, Homer.
- No favors.

17:58.202 --> 18:00.751
Don't scream. You coming out or going in?

18:00.871 --> 18:03.044
- Are you the police?
- Smile when you say that.

18:03.165 --> 18:05.668
- I'm a reporter.
- Oh, a newspaperman.

18:05.793 --> 18:07.966
Well, you don't have to say it like that.

18:08.087 --> 18:09.805
Let go of me. Go away!

18:13.009 --> 18:15.979
Are you just going to
leave me dangling here?

18:16.095 --> 18:17.438
- Well, you just said let you...
- I don't care what I said.

18:17.555 --> 18:18.977
Help me get out of here!

18:19.098 --> 18:22.022
Pleasure, Mrs. J.
You are Mrs. Johnson, aren't you?

18:22.143 --> 18:24.916
No, I'm the maid taking my night out!

18:27.106 --> 18:29.029
Oh! What magic I possess!

18:29.150 --> 18:31.369
A moment ago, total strangers.
Now you're in my arms.

18:31.485 --> 18:33.579
So, it's love at first sight.

18:33.696 --> 18:36.176
Now, show me how you got up here
without the police seeing you.

18:36.198 --> 18:38.451
- Do I get the story?
- After I get out of here.

18:38.576 --> 18:39.577
Follow me, ma'am.

18:50.004 --> 18:53.099
Looks like half the police force
is down there.

18:58.971 --> 19:00.018
Must I?

19:00.139 --> 19:03.143
Just look straight ahead
like you did when you got married.

19:03.893 --> 19:06.362
Incidentally, my name's Legget.
Legget of The Graphic.

19:06.479 --> 19:09.983
We've got a dandy little sheet, all full
of goo and gore and everything.

19:10.107 --> 19:11.108
Hey!

19:11.233 --> 19:13.281
Bye.

19:51.190 --> 19:53.443
- You wish something?
- Gin over rocks.

19:53.567 --> 19:55.365
- Rocks?
- Is this chair taken, madam?

19:55.486 --> 19:57.486
Why, thank you, Mrs. Johnson,
I'd love to join you.

19:57.530 --> 19:58.702
You didn't think you were
going to get rid of me

19:58.823 --> 20:00.666
as easily as you ducked
the police, did you?

20:00.783 --> 20:03.878
I'll have you know, Mrs. J, I'm an old
fire-escape man from way back.

20:03.994 --> 20:05.837
Why don't you get lost?

20:11.794 --> 20:13.717
Now, then, how about the story?

20:13.838 --> 20:16.762
You'll get the story from my husband
when he's safe and sound in jail.

20:16.882 --> 20:18.429
Oh, but he won't be safe and sound.

20:18.551 --> 20:19.973
Have you forgotten a feller
by the name of Joe Gordon?

20:20.094 --> 20:21.095
Do you wish something?

20:21.220 --> 20:22.722
Yeah, let me have a bourbon old-fashioned.

20:22.847 --> 20:24.224
Yes, sir.

20:24.348 --> 20:27.022
Why did you come here tonight,
Mrs. Johnson? Or shouldn't I ask?

20:27.143 --> 20:28.565
Because I like it here.

20:28.686 --> 20:31.155
You didn't by any chance come here
to meet, say, your husband, did you?

20:31.272 --> 20:33.240
Or is that a far-fetched supposition?

20:33.357 --> 20:35.405
Supposition? I'd better stop
using those four-syllable words.

20:35.526 --> 20:36.823
I won't be working
for The Graphic any more.

20:36.944 --> 20:38.464
- Where's your husband?
- I don't know.

20:38.487 --> 20:39.488
- Did he see the killer?
- I don't know.

20:39.613 --> 20:41.641
- Shall we dance?
- Why don't you drop dead?

20:47.496 --> 20:49.419
Why don't you be nice to me, Mrs. Johnson?

20:49.540 --> 20:51.463
Who knows?
I might even be able to help you.

20:51.584 --> 20:53.264
I'm not a bad guy when you get to know me.

20:53.377 --> 20:55.721
A little obnoxious, perhaps, but pleasant.

20:55.838 --> 20:57.511
Now, then, answer yes or no.

20:57.631 --> 20:59.554
Your husband saw the murder
and took it on the lam, right?

20:59.675 --> 21:02.224
- Right.
- And you're... you're meeting him here?

21:02.344 --> 21:04.563
I haven't the slightest idea.
I came here on a hunch.

21:04.680 --> 21:05.681
When he phoned tonight,

21:05.806 --> 21:08.275
I heard music that could only
have come from this joint.

21:08.392 --> 21:10.032
- Something to eat?
- No, thanks. No food.

21:10.144 --> 21:12.567
- Oh, go ahead. Try something.
- No, really. Nothing.

21:16.317 --> 21:18.911
Oh, I've got a deal for you.

21:19.028 --> 21:22.032
You find your husband with my help,
give me an exclusive for 24 hours,

21:22.156 --> 21:23.453
and I get my paper to pay you for it.

21:23.574 --> 21:24.917
Trying to buy me so soon?

21:25.034 --> 21:28.334
First I'm gonna try and buy you.
And if I can't, I'm gonna try to win you.

21:28.454 --> 21:30.422
Isn't that the reverse
of the usual procedure?

21:30.539 --> 21:32.212
I'm a perverse fellow.

21:32.333 --> 21:34.882
On second thought, Mrs. J,
I find you very attractive.

21:35.002 --> 21:38.097
- I may try and win you right off.
- No, thanks. I'd rather be bought.

21:38.214 --> 21:42.594
Very mercenary. All to the good,
though. I like mercenary women.

21:48.891 --> 21:50.609
- Can you really get the money?
- Sure.

21:50.726 --> 21:52.854
- How much?
- Oh, I don't know. Grand maybe.

21:52.978 --> 21:53.978
Is it worth that much?

21:54.021 --> 21:56.319
Will be, by the time
I get through building it up.

21:56.440 --> 21:58.613
Frank will need it
if he wants to get away.

21:58.734 --> 22:00.532
I'll bring it with me.
Just tell me where and when.

22:00.653 --> 22:02.371
And you won't print anything
until I give the word?

22:02.488 --> 22:04.866
- Scout's honor.
- It's a deal.

22:04.990 --> 22:07.118
Shall we drink to it?

22:07.243 --> 22:09.587
To the, uh... speedy conclusion
of all our troubles.

22:09.703 --> 22:12.206
Yours, your husband's, and mine.

22:12.331 --> 22:13.958
You've got troubles? You don't look it.

22:14.083 --> 22:17.462
None that I can't solve,
now that we're partners.

22:19.129 --> 22:20.130
Hiya, Mrs. Johnson.

22:20.256 --> 22:22.805
Hi, Sammy, sit down.
Meet Mr. Legget of The Graphic.

22:22.925 --> 22:24.347
- Oh, a newspaperman.
- Sammy.

22:24.468 --> 22:25.845
You should have caught the show.

22:25.970 --> 22:27.688
Suzie and I are breaking in a new act.

22:27.805 --> 22:29.978
Chung and Okito. It's terrific.

22:30.099 --> 22:33.399
That's spelt C-H-U-N-G.
Anybody can spell Okito.

22:33.519 --> 22:36.479
Course, we're only breaking in the
show here, but a little plug would help.

22:36.522 --> 22:39.025
Well, I'll, uh... I'll see what I can do.

22:39.149 --> 22:40.651
Thanks. Next time you come,
catch a midnight show.

22:40.776 --> 22:42.995
The place is really jumping then.
I'll be seeing you.

22:43.112 --> 22:44.409
- Bye, Sammy.
- Bye.

22:44.530 --> 22:46.749
Well, I think I'll go home.
Frank won't show tonight.

22:46.866 --> 22:49.745
- How do you know?
- I just know, that's all.

22:49.869 --> 22:51.587
What are you gonna tell your husband
when you see him?

22:51.704 --> 22:54.799
To give himself up.
Maybe I'll give up too.

23:16.645 --> 23:19.068
Leave your flag down.

23:20.107 --> 23:21.529
You want to go in over the roof?

23:21.650 --> 23:24.119
No, I'll go in the front door
and give them something to think about.

23:24.236 --> 23:25.237
In that case, I'll disappear.

23:25.362 --> 23:27.239
Let's not give 'em
too much to think about.

23:27.364 --> 23:29.458
Well, if I need you,
I'll get in touch with you.

23:29.575 --> 23:31.373
You won't have to get in touch
with me, Mrs. Johnson.

23:31.493 --> 23:35.088
- Just look around. I'll be there.
- Good night, Mr. Legget.

23:45.841 --> 23:46.842
What are you doing here?

23:46.967 --> 23:48.184
That was nice going, Mrs. Johnson,

23:48.302 --> 23:51.272
but the next time you try to get out,
you'll have more trouble.

23:53.015 --> 23:55.017
I've got news for you.

23:55.893 --> 23:57.770
I've just seen your husband's doctor.

23:57.895 --> 23:59.943
Why? Aren't you feeling well?

24:01.315 --> 24:04.159
Your husband isn't a hypochondriac.

24:04.276 --> 24:06.449
He's a very sick man.
He's got a bad heart.

24:10.366 --> 24:13.370
- I don't believe it.
- Ask Dr. Hohler.

24:18.415 --> 24:20.509
Frank never said anything to me about it.

24:20.626 --> 24:23.755
Maybe he figured
you wouldn't be interested.

24:23.879 --> 24:25.973
Well, he can walk into any drugstore
and buy some medicine.

24:26.090 --> 24:27.387
Not without a prescription, he can't,

24:27.508 --> 24:29.388
and I've given orders
to every drugstore in town

24:29.468 --> 24:33.189
that none of this medicine's to be
dispensed without an order from me.

24:33.305 --> 24:35.307
If he should have an attack
and not have that with him,

24:35.432 --> 24:36.524
you know what that means.

24:36.642 --> 24:37.643
You can't do that.

24:37.768 --> 24:41.068
If it's the only way I can get him to
come in and testify, I mean to use it.

24:41.188 --> 24:42.428
But Frank's done nothing wrong.

24:42.523 --> 24:45.493
Oh, yes, he has. He was in
the wrong place at the wrong time.

24:45.609 --> 24:48.649
I thought the police were supposed to
protect people, not put them in danger.

24:48.737 --> 24:49.977
All it says in my book, sister,

24:49.989 --> 24:52.333
is that the good of the majority
has got to be upheld.

24:52.449 --> 24:55.419
And for the good of the majority,
Frank Johnson's got to testify.

24:55.536 --> 24:57.709
If he gives himself up,
we'll give him a supply of medicine.

24:57.830 --> 24:58.831
We'll protect him.

24:58.956 --> 24:59.957
And if he doesn't?

25:00.082 --> 25:03.632
He'll die of a heart attack, or a bullet
from one of Smiley Freeman's men.

25:03.752 --> 25:06.592
I don't believe a word you're saying.
You're only trying to frighten me.

25:06.630 --> 25:08.849
And I'm getting pretty sick of you.
Now get out of here.

25:08.966 --> 25:12.220
Of course, if you want to try to
find him, I won't try to stop you.

25:12.344 --> 25:14.346
But I don't think you can find him.

25:15.264 --> 25:18.689
I don't think he's running away from us.
I think he's running away from you.

25:18.809 --> 25:20.652
I said get out.

25:59.725 --> 26:01.853
I am violating my instructions
from the police,

26:01.977 --> 26:03.479
by giving you this additional supply,

26:03.604 --> 26:05.948
but rest assured
it gives me no feeling of guilt.

26:06.065 --> 26:07.066
Thank you, Doctor.

26:07.191 --> 26:08.408
After the excitement of last night,

26:08.525 --> 26:12.371
your husband undoubtedly used
the ampoules he carried with him.

26:12.488 --> 26:14.616
So, you see, my action is
not prompted by kindness,

26:14.740 --> 26:18.290
so much as reluctance
to gamble with a man's life.

26:18.410 --> 26:20.458
Is his heart really that bad, Doctor?

26:20.579 --> 26:22.331
Frank's condition isn't any worse

26:22.456 --> 26:26.256
than tons of men that strain
their hearts, running in track meets.

26:26.376 --> 26:29.279
The misguided believe that
they were building up their bodies.

26:29.379 --> 26:31.598
If it were only his heart,
we could control it.

26:31.715 --> 26:32.716
What do you mean?

26:32.841 --> 26:35.890
Well, for the past year,
your husband has had hypertension.

26:36.011 --> 26:37.558
That complicates matters.

26:37.679 --> 26:39.226
Hypertension? What causes that?

26:39.348 --> 26:44.229
Well, I'm not sure. My guess is
overwork, unhappiness, anxiety.

26:44.353 --> 26:46.776
- But you know more about it than I do.
- Why should I?

26:46.897 --> 26:48.820
But, naturally, you must
know about his troubles.

26:48.941 --> 26:51.069
I'm only his doctor. You're his wife.

26:51.193 --> 26:54.197
Oh, yes. I'm that bitter,
selfish, vicious wife.

26:54.321 --> 26:56.481
The cause of his unhappiness.
The cause of his failure.

26:56.490 --> 26:58.413
Is that what he told you?
Is that what he tells everyone?

26:58.534 --> 27:02.710
Frank didn't discuss his private life with
me, nor do I care to hear it from you.

27:02.830 --> 27:06.084
I shall explain to you his condition
and that's all.

27:06.208 --> 27:09.178
He has a cardiac condition.
Let's call it X.

27:09.294 --> 27:13.720
Now, X alone is not serious. He also
has hypertension. Let's call it Y.

27:13.841 --> 27:16.594
Now, X plus Y is dangerous.

27:16.718 --> 27:17.890
I'm Y, I suppose.

27:18.011 --> 27:21.561
I'm not a psychiatrist, Mrs. Johnson.
I deal only with facts.

27:21.682 --> 27:26.404
X plus Y equals steady deterioration.
X minus Y is an improvement.

27:26.520 --> 27:29.990
And what you and your husband do
about it, that's your personal concern.

27:30.107 --> 27:33.486
My only personal concern right now
is to get these ampoules to him.

27:33.610 --> 27:36.113
If you see him, tell him
he should give himself up.

27:36.238 --> 27:38.536
It's imperative to take
the strain off himself.

27:38.657 --> 27:41.160
I'll give him the facts.
He can draw his own conclusions.

28:25.704 --> 28:28.048
Oh, Frank darling,
I'd thought I'd never find you!

28:28.165 --> 28:32.420
Now, stay right here. I'll be back
in five minutes to explain everything.

28:35.297 --> 28:38.267
- All right, Mr. Johnson, come along.
- My name isn't Johnson.

28:38.383 --> 28:40.306
Yeah, and I suppose
that isn't your wife either?

28:40.427 --> 28:41.724
No, but I wish it were.

28:41.845 --> 28:43.438
Do you have any identification?

28:43.555 --> 28:46.274
Yes, I have. My name is
Steven Carruthers, optometrist.

28:46.391 --> 28:50.362
And while we're on the subject, I think
you'd better have your eyes examined.

29:08.038 --> 29:10.382
So, Frank is a fugitive from the law?

29:10.499 --> 29:13.969
Well, that's just like him.
He's so adventurous.

29:14.086 --> 29:17.181
- Adventurous? Frank?
- Oh, yes, indeed.

29:17.297 --> 29:18.640
Sit down, Mrs. Johnson.

29:18.757 --> 29:21.351
I guess you never visited
our workshop before.

29:21.468 --> 29:23.436
What makes you think he's adventurous?

29:23.553 --> 29:27.979
Oh, but he is. All the places
he's gone and all the things he's done.

29:28.100 --> 29:30.853
You know, my life
has been pretty uneventful.

29:30.978 --> 29:33.276
Straight from high school to this job.

29:33.397 --> 29:36.822
From my rooming house, to the
streetcar, and then down here to work.

29:36.942 --> 29:39.286
In the evening, back
to my rooming house again.

29:39.403 --> 29:41.497
But since he's been here, it's different.

29:41.613 --> 29:44.082
He... he makes my life kind of exciting.

29:44.199 --> 29:46.167
I never get tired of listening
to the stories he tells

29:46.285 --> 29:47.832
about his trip down to Mexico,

29:47.953 --> 29:50.957
when he was wandering around
with all those bullfighters.

29:51.081 --> 29:55.632
And when he shipped off to Tahiti in
that old freighter and then jumped ship.

29:55.752 --> 30:00.724
Oh, I'm sorry. I suppose you've heard
these stories many times, Mrs. Johnson.

30:00.841 --> 30:02.514
I never heard them. He never told me.

30:02.634 --> 30:07.435
He didn't? Well, maybe
he didn't want his wife to know...

30:07.556 --> 30:09.558
Oh, I'm sorry if I talked out of turn.

30:09.683 --> 30:12.277
Of course you haven't.
Shouldn't the mail be here?

30:12.394 --> 30:14.692
Why, yes. Yes, it should. Why?

30:14.813 --> 30:16.531
Frank sent me a letter in care of you.

30:16.648 --> 30:17.865
Oh, he did?

30:17.983 --> 30:20.486
I don't know
what Mr. Andersen's going to say,

30:20.610 --> 30:22.954
when he finds out
Frank isn't coming in today.

30:23.071 --> 30:25.119
You know he's got a terrible disposition.

30:25.240 --> 30:29.245
He doesn't exercise enough.
Course, I don't either. But then...

30:29.369 --> 30:32.498
Well, I'm gonna protect Frank.
He saved my job once.

30:32.622 --> 30:34.750
You know, Mr. Andersen was gonna fire me.

30:34.875 --> 30:38.345
But Frank said, "If Mr. Maibus goes,
you can pay me off too!"

30:38.462 --> 30:40.089
Oh, they had a terrible argument.

30:40.213 --> 30:43.262
They even took it upstairs to Mr. Winston!

30:43.383 --> 30:46.853
Well, we're still here.
Frank was too valuable.

30:48.555 --> 30:52.185
Look, Mr. Maibus, don't tell anyone
about that letter that's coming.

30:52.309 --> 30:54.403
Oh, no, no, no. You can trust me.

30:54.519 --> 30:56.317
Not even the police.

30:56.438 --> 30:58.611
The police? Are they coming here?

30:58.732 --> 30:59.984
They're very apt to.

31:00.108 --> 31:01.428
But just don't mention the letter

31:01.526 --> 31:03.324
or anything about
my being here at all, huh?

31:03.445 --> 31:05.743
Well, I don't know how good
I am at deceiving people,

31:05.864 --> 31:08.037
but if it's for Frank, I'll try.

31:08.158 --> 31:10.661
Hey, Maibus! You better get
the lead out and get upstairs.

31:10.786 --> 31:12.129
Andersen's blowing his top.

31:12.245 --> 31:14.714
OK, I'll be right up. Is the mail in yet?

31:14.831 --> 31:17.960
- How should I know?
- Nice people.

31:18.085 --> 31:21.385
Sometimes I think it'd be better
for Frank if he got himself fired.

31:21.505 --> 31:23.633
Why, he doesn't belong around here.

31:23.757 --> 31:27.637
Look at all the time he puts
in these mannequins.

31:27.761 --> 31:31.061
Say, I just noticed something.
This looks like you.

31:31.181 --> 31:33.400
Very flattering.
Is that the way he sees me?

31:33.517 --> 31:34.797
Well, it may be a little severe,

31:34.810 --> 31:37.313
but it shows he was
thinking about you anyway.

31:37.437 --> 31:38.780
Yes, and what he was thinking.

31:38.897 --> 31:40.444
Mail!

31:40.565 --> 31:44.240
You've only got two today, Mr. Maibus.
Wasn't Frank here?

31:44.361 --> 31:46.739
No, no, he's late.
Was there a letter for him?

31:46.863 --> 31:49.036
No, I just had a new song
I wanted him to hear.

31:49.157 --> 31:51.125
Frank's the only one
who listens to me sing.

31:51.243 --> 31:55.373
Oh, brother, have I got a crush
on that man! Mm-mm!

31:56.581 --> 31:58.549
- No letter.
- Oh, but there's got to be one.

31:58.667 --> 32:01.671
Well, maybe it'll be here on
the afternoon mail at three o'clock.

32:01.795 --> 32:06.551
If one comes, hold it for me. And
let's just keep it our secret, shall we?

32:14.391 --> 32:15.563
Morning, Mrs. Johnson.

32:15.684 --> 32:17.607
He didn't show up for work
this morning, did he?

32:17.727 --> 32:20.276
- Where's your new pal, Legget?
- I haven't the vaguest idea.

32:20.397 --> 32:23.526
I wouldn't get too cozy
with that guy, if I were you.

32:23.650 --> 32:25.527
He'd crucify his grandmother for a story.

32:25.652 --> 32:27.950
I haven't found him
as objectionable as you are.

32:28.071 --> 32:29.698
What right have you,
prying into my personal life?

32:29.823 --> 32:31.951
Having me followed
as if I were a criminal?

32:32.075 --> 32:34.235
I'm sick of it, I'm sick of you,
and I want it stopped.

32:34.286 --> 32:36.789
Mrs. Johnson,
didn't your husband ever beat you?

32:36.913 --> 32:38.873
Are you going to have
these men stop following me?

32:38.874 --> 32:40.922
The man who killed Joe Gordon
isn't stupid.

32:41.042 --> 32:44.046
If I'm smart enough to use you as
a bird dog to lead us to your husband,

32:44.171 --> 32:45.263
so is he.

32:45.380 --> 32:48.304
You may be very happy to have a cop
around, before this thing's over.

32:48.425 --> 32:49.927
That I doubt.

32:50.594 --> 32:52.187
Stick with her.

32:52.304 --> 32:55.148
How could I lose a redhead like that?

33:31.301 --> 33:35.056
Oh, don't be so grumpy this morning.
All I'm trying to do is help you.

33:35.180 --> 33:39.981
Do you know that you've got a little
shadow? Uh-huh, there she is.

33:40.101 --> 33:42.775
Well, it's a nice morning for a ride.

33:42.896 --> 33:46.366
Oh, by the way, here's your letter.

33:46.483 --> 33:48.030
- Well, how did you...
- Surprised? Don't be.

33:48.151 --> 33:50.779
Ten dollars and an underpaid
store clerk can get you anything.

33:50.904 --> 33:52.906
But don't you worry about it.
I'll put it on my expense account.

33:53.031 --> 33:54.032
But how did you know about it?

33:54.157 --> 33:56.785
The menu. You shouldn't have left it.
It was very careless of you.

33:56.910 --> 33:58.162
I have inquisitive eyes.

33:58.286 --> 34:00.539
Do you always open other people's mail?

34:00.664 --> 34:02.691
Mm-hm, every chance I get.

34:02.791 --> 34:04.818
Say, did you get a load of
the female impersonator

34:04.918 --> 34:07.046
- they've got following you?
- No.

34:08.213 --> 34:10.261
Well, let's duck her
and get down to business.

34:10.382 --> 34:12.976
Hey, Mac, turn left on the next street
then right up the alley.

34:13.092 --> 34:15.061
OK.

34:28.358 --> 34:30.735
- Mean anything to you?
- Oh, a lot of things.

34:30.860 --> 34:33.409
- Something to go on?
- I'm not sure.

34:33.530 --> 34:35.748
What does he mean in there
about the doctor and the ampoules?

34:35.864 --> 34:38.493
It's medicine he needs.
He has a bad heart.

34:38.618 --> 34:41.542
- How bad?
- Bad enough. I just found out.

34:41.663 --> 34:44.132
He's got to have these pills
and he can't get them anywhere.

34:44.248 --> 34:45.420
The police have seen to that.

34:45.542 --> 34:48.762
Yeah? Squeeze play. That Ferris is smart.

34:50.005 --> 34:53.304
- Will he die?
- I don't know. I spoke to his doctor.

34:53.425 --> 34:56.725
It isn't serious,
only under certain conditions.

34:57.262 --> 34:59.606
That would explain...

34:59.723 --> 35:03.773
"The police will probably read this
note so I can't tell you where I'll be.

35:03.893 --> 35:06.612
"But if you think back,
you'll know where to find me."

35:06.730 --> 35:08.277
What am I, a mind reader?

35:08.398 --> 35:10.867
Well, he gives you a clue
in this next line.

35:10.984 --> 35:12.406
"I'll be out in the open, under the sun,

35:12.527 --> 35:14.655
"in a place like the one
where I first lost you."

35:14.779 --> 35:17.407
There is no "first" in things like these.

35:17.532 --> 35:20.081
This is kind of obscure.
Does he always talk to you like this?

35:20.201 --> 35:21.874
No, it's our first murder.

35:23.747 --> 35:26.216
You know, Mrs. J, your husband's
a pretty clever guy at that.

35:26.333 --> 35:29.507
Oh, I know you don't think so, but he is.
He's testing you.

35:29.628 --> 35:32.006
He's asking you to admit
that your marriage is a failure

35:32.130 --> 35:33.382
and that it's your fault.

35:33.506 --> 35:36.430
He's saying that he understands you
but that you don't understand him.

35:36.551 --> 35:38.645
Now, listen, Mr. Legget of The Graphic.

35:38.762 --> 35:41.481
I've had just about enough
of the all-wise male.

35:41.598 --> 35:44.442
In the past ten hours, I've met three men,

35:44.559 --> 35:45.685
three men who, all put together,

35:45.810 --> 35:49.235
haven't known Frank for one fraction
of the length of time I have.

35:49.356 --> 35:51.654
Yet they all know him better than I do.

35:51.775 --> 35:54.654
Well, along the way,
I found out a few things myself.

35:54.778 --> 35:57.531
I found out how Frank Johnson
really feels about me.

35:57.656 --> 36:01.411
That at the first chance,
his first excuse, he took off, ran.

36:01.534 --> 36:04.583
That he didn't even think enough of me
to confide in me that he was ill.

36:04.704 --> 36:07.207
Then, at the store, in the faces
of those mannequins,

36:07.332 --> 36:09.334
I saw what he really sees in me.

36:09.459 --> 36:11.619
All right, it's OK
if that's the way he feels about it,

36:11.628 --> 36:15.349
but if he wants his ampoules, he'll have
to come out of hiding and get them.

36:17.801 --> 36:19.929
What did you have for breakfast?
Cigarette and coffee?

36:20.053 --> 36:21.930
- Cigarette.
- I thought so.

36:22.055 --> 36:25.150
- Take us over to Lancey's on Powell.
- Lancey's? OK.

36:25.266 --> 36:28.816
This place has the best waffles in
town. Butter in every little square.

36:28.937 --> 36:31.816
View's always better on a full tummy.

36:33.191 --> 36:36.365
- How about another one?
- Oh, no, thanks.

36:36.486 --> 36:37.988
Now that I've got you softened up, Mrs. J,

36:38.113 --> 36:40.787
there's something that I have to tell you.

36:40.907 --> 36:42.375
You have to find your husband.

36:42.492 --> 36:45.837
Oh, not for the money, I promise you,
or my story, but for yourself.

36:45.954 --> 36:49.504
He's challenged you. You've got
to accept it or admit he's right.

36:49.624 --> 36:53.379
I really would like to find him. If only
I could decipher the riddle in this letter.

36:53.503 --> 36:54.880
Together we can do it.

36:55.004 --> 36:57.132
That letter's like...
like drawing a graph.

36:57.257 --> 36:59.476
One line is to trace
his movements from last night.

36:59.592 --> 37:02.471
The other leads back into the past,
which you have to remember.

37:02.595 --> 37:05.769
Where they cross,
that's where your husband is.

37:05.890 --> 37:07.892
You need a manicure.

37:08.017 --> 37:09.485
So I do.

37:09.602 --> 37:10.603
You know,
this is the first time in my life

37:10.729 --> 37:13.278
I ever insisted on helping
a woman find her husband.

37:13.398 --> 37:14.695
That I believe.

37:14.816 --> 37:18.662
By the way, what do people call you
besides Legget of The Graphic?

37:18.778 --> 37:22.578
Oh, people who like me call me Danny Boy.

37:26.077 --> 37:28.079
OK, Danny Boy.

37:32.000 --> 37:35.721
Fisherman's Wharf.
Frank used to come here a lot.

37:35.837 --> 37:38.681
I remember, once, he did
a watercolor of a boat.

37:38.798 --> 37:42.302
A ﬁsherman admired it
so Frank just gave it to him.

37:42.427 --> 37:46.227
Not to be outdone, the ﬁsherman
gave Frank a big swordﬁsh.

37:46.347 --> 37:49.191
I made a remark about the joys
of living by the barter system

37:49.309 --> 37:51.107
and we had a bitter quarrel.

37:51.227 --> 37:52.900
But it certainly wasn't the ﬁrst one.

37:53.021 --> 37:54.614
Do you think Frank
was referring to a quarrel,

37:54.731 --> 37:56.733
when he said, "where I ﬁrst lost you"?

37:56.858 --> 37:58.610
What else?

37:58.735 --> 38:01.454
Another started up here on Telegraph Hill.

38:01.571 --> 38:04.996
Frank did a canvas of the harbor
from here that I thought was wonderful.

38:05.116 --> 38:09.417
When I told him so, he insinuated
that my taste in art ran to calendars.

38:09.537 --> 38:12.962
I said my taste was my own
and I wanted the painting.

38:13.082 --> 38:16.837
So, he gave it to me,
but he signed it "Eleanor's husband".

38:17.003 --> 38:18.003
Without telling him,

38:18.087 --> 38:21.717
I entered it in a contest they were
having here at the art gallery.

38:21.841 --> 38:26.642
The Oil by Eleanor's husband
won ﬁrst prize. Five hundred dollars.

38:26.763 --> 38:29.437
But do you think Frank
was pleased when he found out?

38:29.557 --> 38:33.278
Oh, no. He refused the money
and withdrew the painting.

38:33.394 --> 38:35.146
Said he wasn't ready yet.

38:35.271 --> 38:38.195
- Sounds pretty stubborn.
- Stupidly stubborn.

38:38.316 --> 38:41.365
I wonder if he ever really
wanted to be successful.

38:41.486 --> 38:44.239
Soon after that, he took the job
at Hart & Winston's.

38:44.364 --> 38:45.490
You know, the only thing we know for sure

38:45.615 --> 38:48.789
is that Frank was
at the Oriental Gardens last night.

38:48.910 --> 38:50.583
While we're in the neighborhood,
let's drop in.

38:50.703 --> 38:52.183
Yeah, he sat around the dressing room

38:52.247 --> 38:54.047
until we came down to do
the one o'clock show.

38:54.082 --> 38:55.802
Then he said he was
gonna make a phone call.

38:55.834 --> 38:57.256
Then Frank wrote the letter.

38:57.377 --> 38:58.424
He said to get in touch with you.

38:58.545 --> 39:01.264
That he was gonna send the letter
to a store, care of Mr. Maibus.

39:01.381 --> 39:03.383
Haven't I seen you some place before?

39:03.508 --> 39:05.108
Shouldn't be surprised. I've been there.

39:05.218 --> 39:07.846
But didn't he say what he was
going to do or where he might go?

39:07.971 --> 39:10.065
I didn't want to pump him.
Say, why don't you try Sullivan?

39:10.181 --> 39:11.182
Who's Sullivan?

39:11.307 --> 39:13.355
He's a grand Mick.
Runs a bar across the street.

39:13.476 --> 39:15.774
Come on, I'll show you.
You can go down the backstairs.

39:15.895 --> 39:18.990
Now I know where I've seen you
before! Last night.

39:19.107 --> 39:20.654
Sure, I was in with Mrs. Johnson.

39:20.775 --> 39:23.153
No, I mean the picture that Frank drew.

39:23.278 --> 39:25.451
Picture?

39:25.572 --> 39:28.200
- What picture? Of me?
- Well, it looks something like you.

39:28.324 --> 39:31.077
You know how Frank's
always drawing pictures.

39:31.202 --> 39:34.081
- Did he say who this man was?
- No, no, he didn't.

39:34.205 --> 39:36.583
I wonder if I should have
told the cops about it.

39:36.708 --> 39:38.585
Oh, well, they'll be back.
The man that was in said so.

39:38.710 --> 39:40.508
Suzie, quit yacking!

39:40.628 --> 39:44.258
Uh... do you still have the picture?
Maybe I could run it in the paper.

39:44.382 --> 39:46.760
Yeah, it's upstairs in my dressing
room. I'd better keep it, though.

39:46.885 --> 39:50.856
Hey, Legget. Are you sure
you want to help find Frank?

39:50.972 --> 39:55.193
Say, don't forget that plug in the paper
about us. We could sure use it.

39:57.020 --> 40:01.196
OK, take it from the top.
I've got to go see our agent.

40:19.167 --> 40:23.047
I've heard about this place for years.
Never been here before.

40:30.929 --> 40:32.397
What'll you have, folks? You hungry?

40:32.513 --> 40:34.811
Specialty today, corn beef
and cabbage or egg fu yung.

40:34.933 --> 40:35.934
No food.

40:36.059 --> 40:38.778
Gin on the rocks for the lady
and an old-fashioned for me.

40:38.895 --> 40:40.818
I think I'll call a favor
and see if anything's broken.

40:40.939 --> 40:43.943
You can get more out of him alone anyway.

40:44.067 --> 40:47.446
- Say, why don't you wear a hat?
- I look funny in hats.

40:47.570 --> 40:49.789
You know, you're right.

40:49.906 --> 40:51.954
What is it?

40:55.828 --> 40:57.922
No, I didn't drop a nickel.

41:15.682 --> 41:18.686
Yes, Mrs. Johnson. Frank was in here
last night, just before closing time.

41:18.810 --> 41:20.403
Did he say where he was going?

41:20.520 --> 41:23.023
No, he didn't.
Just borrowed ten bucks is all.

41:23.147 --> 41:24.148
Maybe I should tell you,

41:24.273 --> 41:27.402
there was a couple of fellows in here
this morning, asking about Frank,

41:27.527 --> 41:30.827
fellows that you couldn't very well
say, "Mind your own business" to.

41:30.947 --> 41:32.949
Is he in some sort of trouble,
Mrs. Johnson?

41:33.074 --> 41:35.202
Some. He didn't come home last night.

41:35.326 --> 41:39.627
They're all alike. I've been
looking for mine for three years.

41:40.748 --> 41:42.546
I'm glad I finally met you, ma'am.

41:42.667 --> 41:45.420
I often wondered what kind
of a woman Frank was married to.

41:45.545 --> 41:47.639
Not that I imagine
he was too easy to live with,

41:47.755 --> 41:50.429
being so quiet and moody
and strange at times.

41:50.550 --> 41:52.848
For instance, now, look at this picture.

41:52.969 --> 41:54.346
Look at the date he put on it.

41:54.470 --> 41:58.145
Frank painted this for me about six
months ago. It was on St Patrick's Day.

41:58.266 --> 42:02.146
But look at the date on it.
March 17th, 1947.

42:02.270 --> 42:04.944
Well, I suppose
it's an artist's privilege.

42:05.064 --> 42:07.533
March 17th. That's Frank's birthday.

42:07.650 --> 42:09.698
1947.

42:11.070 --> 42:13.368
We spent the day on the beach
at Cypress Point.

42:13.489 --> 42:16.959
Then we suddenly decided we had to
see the sunset from the top of the mark,

42:17.076 --> 42:18.919
so we drove to San Francisco.

42:19.037 --> 42:20.414
We had a car then.

42:20.538 --> 42:21.585
We had champagne cocktails

42:21.706 --> 42:24.209
and watched the sunset
over the Golden Gate.

42:24.333 --> 42:27.212
After all, it was Frank's birthday
and St Patrick's.

42:27.336 --> 42:31.182
We had a beautiful dinner at Andre's,
and Café Diablo at Amigos.

42:31.299 --> 42:34.894
Then we drove back to Carmel in
the softest moonlight I've ever known.

42:35.011 --> 42:38.015
Ah, there's nothing like being
young and in love. And daft.

42:38.139 --> 42:39.140
To boot.

42:39.265 --> 42:41.142
- What?
- Daft, to boot.

42:41.267 --> 42:44.771
Well, I guess people are entitled
to do crazy things on their birthday.

42:44.896 --> 42:47.866
This year we didn't. I went to a movie.

42:47.982 --> 42:49.859
Frank came down here
and painted that picture.

42:51.152 --> 42:52.272
Now I know what Frank meant,

42:52.278 --> 42:54.758
when he said someone should
have been in that picture with him.

43:15.426 --> 43:17.474
I have a notion, if your husband
could have seen your face,

43:17.595 --> 43:20.644
when you were telling about
that birthday party in 1947,

43:20.765 --> 43:22.984
he'd have painted you right smack
in the middle of that picture,

43:23.101 --> 43:24.648
with his arms around you.

43:24.769 --> 43:26.191
Ah, sorry I was so long.

43:26.312 --> 43:28.110
Oh, Mr. Legget of The Graphic,
Mr. Sullivan.

43:28.231 --> 43:30.279
He's helping me look for Frank.

43:30.399 --> 43:33.528
Hi. Freshen up a little, will you?
Hold the garbage.

43:33.653 --> 43:36.281
- You?
- No, I'm fine.

43:36.405 --> 43:38.828
- Get something?
- Something I hadn't counted on.

43:38.950 --> 43:40.918
- What?
- Frank still loves me.

43:41.035 --> 43:43.914
- That's a big help.
- I think so.

43:44.038 --> 43:45.039
If it'll help any,

43:45.164 --> 43:47.587
Frank asked me how early
the Army & Navy Store's open.

43:47.708 --> 43:49.551
The one that's down on the Embarcadero.

43:49.669 --> 43:52.297
Now he's getting smart.
He's changed his clothes.

43:52.421 --> 43:54.048
What do you say we cover it?

43:54.173 --> 43:57.268
Oh, I... I'm sorry I was so rude
a moment ago,

43:57.385 --> 44:00.514
but it's always discouraging to hear
a wife say that her husband loves her.

44:00.638 --> 44:01.981
What do you write? Comic strips?

44:02.098 --> 44:05.728
Never more serious in my life.
What's the damages?

44:05.852 --> 44:08.105
Oh, it's on the house.
I hope you find him, Mrs. Johnson.

44:08.229 --> 44:09.481
Thanks.

44:09.605 --> 44:11.824
It's no use looking, honey.

44:12.942 --> 44:15.570
Once they're gone, they're gone.

44:34.005 --> 44:35.678
How did it happen?

44:35.798 --> 44:38.096
I was walking along and she almost hit me.

44:38.217 --> 44:41.437
She must have fell from
the Oriental Roof Garden up there.

44:42.972 --> 44:43.973
Who is she?

44:44.098 --> 44:46.817
She's one of the dancers from the show.

44:50.438 --> 44:53.942
Maybe a drink, Sammy? It helps sometimes.

44:54.066 --> 44:55.784
No, thanks.

44:55.902 --> 44:57.870
- Hi, Sammy.
- Let him alone, can't you?

44:57.987 --> 45:00.706
I just heard about it. I'm sorry.

45:00.823 --> 45:03.451
I can't understand it, Inspector.

45:03.576 --> 45:07.422
Suzie was happy. We were doing
great. There was no reason for it.

45:07.538 --> 45:09.586
Sometimes you don't know
what makes people tick,

45:09.707 --> 45:11.835
even the ones closest to us.

45:11.959 --> 45:14.303
I just can't believe she killed herself.

45:14.420 --> 45:15.797
Well, maybe she didn't.

45:15.922 --> 45:18.926
- Inspector, how else...
- Well, it could have been robbery.

45:19.050 --> 45:21.052
She might have surprised
somebody in the dressing room.

45:21.177 --> 45:23.475
Did you check her stuff?
See if anything was missing?

45:23.596 --> 45:26.099
- No.
- Well, do it now.

45:32.521 --> 45:35.049
We've been through
almost all of these places

45:35.149 --> 45:37.618
and we still haven't
found a lead on Frank.

46:07.473 --> 46:10.226
- Mind if I look at this coat?
- That's a man's coat.

46:10.351 --> 46:13.321
- Mind if I look at it?
- It's eight dollars.

46:13.437 --> 46:15.439
That's Frank's coat. Where did you get it?

46:15.564 --> 46:17.532
- None of your business.
- But that's my husband's coat.

46:17.650 --> 46:18.902
No, it ain't. It's mine.

46:19.026 --> 46:21.266
Feller came in here and traded
that coat and four dollars

46:21.279 --> 46:22.781
for a pea jacket and a cap.

46:22.905 --> 46:24.248
- When?
- When I opened up this morning.

46:24.365 --> 46:25.366
Where did he go?

46:25.491 --> 46:27.789
How do I know?
I just sell stuff. I don't watch people.

46:27.910 --> 46:29.912
Shut the door as you go out.

47:10.286 --> 47:11.708
Look.

47:15.291 --> 47:18.886
Well, wouldn't you know? There he is,
just like nothing had happened.

47:19.003 --> 47:20.846
Uh...

47:28.888 --> 47:30.936
Frank.

47:31.057 --> 47:34.561
- I beg pardon?
- Oh, I... I'm sorry.

47:46.280 --> 47:48.999
I never knew there were so many
land-going sailors in the world.

47:49.116 --> 47:52.837
All wearing pea jackets and seamen's caps.

47:57.041 --> 47:59.840
- Beat, huh?
- Mm-hm.

47:59.960 --> 48:02.088
I might as well admit it.
I can't remember.

48:02.213 --> 48:03.214
No, thanks.

48:03.339 --> 48:06.092
There's not much sun left
to find him under.

48:07.343 --> 48:12.190
"If you think back," he said in his letter,
"you'll know where to find me."

48:15.893 --> 48:18.863
Danny, maybe if I'm alone
I can figure this out.

48:18.979 --> 48:20.779
I've got to go home,
anyway, and feed the dog.

48:20.898 --> 48:22.366
He's been locked up all day.

48:22.483 --> 48:26.454
Oh, sure, sure.
I could meet you later some place.

48:26.570 --> 48:27.680
How about picking me up at the corner of

48:27.780 --> 48:29.181
Montgomery and Union Streets,
when you're ready?

48:29.281 --> 48:31.909
- It's not much out of your way.
- All right.

48:32.034 --> 48:34.332
I'll meet you there in an hour.

48:36.330 --> 48:38.674
Uh-oh.

48:38.791 --> 48:41.385
Looks like your shadow's
finally caught up with you.

48:52.638 --> 48:56.017
- Are you as tired as I am?
- I beg your pardon?

48:56.142 --> 48:58.236
Come on. There's no need
for spending two cab fares.

48:58.352 --> 48:59.353
We might as well go together.

48:59.478 --> 49:00.525
- But...
- Come on.

49:00.646 --> 49:03.274
At least you'll have someone to talk to.

49:20.916 --> 49:23.339
As a taxpayer, I thank you.

49:35.598 --> 49:38.898
Hello, Rembrandt.
I'll be with you in a minute.

49:39.018 --> 49:41.020
Hi.

49:41.604 --> 49:44.983
- What, you again? Who let you in?
- Landlord. Do you mind?

49:45.107 --> 49:49.157
Oh, no. Make yourself at home.
I love having cops move in on me.

49:49.278 --> 49:51.576
Where's the letter? Don't pretend
you don't know what I'm talking about.

49:51.697 --> 49:53.995
I mean the letter your pal picked up
at Hart & Winston's this morning.

49:54.116 --> 49:55.117
I want it.

49:55.242 --> 49:59.543
Sees all, knows all. Except where
Frank is and who the killer is.

49:59.663 --> 50:02.623
Why don't you back to jail, or wherever
it is you live, and leave me alone?

50:02.708 --> 50:04.585
Oh, no. The merry-go-round's over.

50:04.710 --> 50:07.680
This case is going cold on me
and you're the only live thing in it.

50:07.796 --> 50:09.890
So, from now on, I'm sticking with you.

50:10.007 --> 50:13.887
That's just peachy. Oh, I'm bushed.

50:14.011 --> 50:17.686
You ought to be. You covered a lot of
territory today. My men are bushed too.

50:17.806 --> 50:20.480
You should be more considerate.

50:20.601 --> 50:23.041
Can you make anything out
of this letter? It's pretty cryptic.

50:23.145 --> 50:25.648
Not yet, but I'm working on it.

50:25.773 --> 50:27.867
This sounds like a guy in love.

50:28.859 --> 50:31.829
- You think so?
- Yeah.

50:31.946 --> 50:34.165
"I'll be out in the open, under the sun,

50:34.281 --> 50:38.036
"in a place like the one
where I first lost you."

50:38.160 --> 50:40.379
That kind of lays it right in your lap.

50:40.496 --> 50:43.170
- Doesn't it mean anything to you?
- I wish it did.

50:43.290 --> 50:45.668
I'm glad you're not
bringing me my medicine.

50:45.793 --> 50:47.887
Oh, don't worry. I'll find him.

50:48.003 --> 50:50.677
And I'll be right there with you,
when you do.

50:50.798 --> 50:53.626
Where you go, I go.

50:56.595 --> 50:59.565
Would you insist upon going with me
if I walked the dog?

50:59.682 --> 51:00.808
I walked him.

51:00.933 --> 51:04.028
Anyway, there's a man out front,
one in back, and one on the roof.

51:04.144 --> 51:06.112
- Fine. I'm staying right here, then.
- So am I.

51:06.230 --> 51:08.107
We'll just wait
till your husband comes to you,

51:08.232 --> 51:10.951
or you can't stand the strain
any longer and go to him.

51:12.194 --> 51:16.165
Look, Mr. Ferris, maybe you're right
in some of the things you said.

51:16.282 --> 51:18.785
Today I discovered a lot about Frank
I never knew before.

51:18.909 --> 51:21.788
In one day what you couldn't
find out in four years?

51:21.912 --> 51:24.631
I guess I was the one that was mixed up.

51:24.748 --> 51:28.378
A lot of it's my fault anyway.
I haven't been much of a wife.

51:28.502 --> 51:31.506
Well, that's quite an admission
from you, Mrs. Johnson.

51:31.630 --> 51:32.677
Please.

51:32.798 --> 51:36.268
You've got to give me a chance to see
Frank alone and give him his medicine.

51:36.385 --> 51:38.854
Then if he wants to come in
and testify, that's up to him.

51:38.971 --> 51:40.973
But it's got to be his choice.

51:41.098 --> 51:42.691
I won't try to influence him
one way or the other.

51:42.808 --> 51:44.810
Whatever he does is all right with me.

51:44.935 --> 51:46.858
But you've got to let me
see him alone first.

51:46.979 --> 51:50.108
I believe you and I'd like to help you,
but I'm a cop.

51:50.232 --> 51:54.378
If Frank keeps on running, I'll have
no witness, to say nothing of a job.

51:58.949 --> 52:01.418
He's hungry.
Couldn't you have fed him too?

52:01.535 --> 52:05.164
He couldn't figure out how to work the
can opener. Can I use your phone?

52:12.588 --> 52:15.137
Hello. Ferris. Anything come in?

52:16.175 --> 52:19.429
Keep it going till we get results.
I think we're getting warm.

52:19.553 --> 52:22.727
Shaw there? Put him on.

53:21.198 --> 53:24.726
I'm sorry, Rembrandt.
It's the only thing I could think of.

53:35.671 --> 53:38.265
- Mr. Ferris?
- Yeah?

53:39.925 --> 53:41.045
I'm worried about Rembrandt.

53:41.093 --> 53:43.266
He was so hungry
and now he won't touch his food.

53:43.387 --> 53:45.435
That's funny.

53:46.724 --> 53:50.319
His nose is so hot.
Maybe I'd better take him to the vet.

53:50.436 --> 53:53.656
- I'll take him. I like dogs.
- Oh, thank you.

53:53.772 --> 53:55.866
Get your shoes.

53:58.986 --> 54:01.535
His temperature is normal. In fact,
he seems to be in perfect health.

54:01.655 --> 54:03.373
But I'm worried about him, Doctor.
He won't eat.

54:03.490 --> 54:04.491
Maybe he isn't hungry.

54:04.616 --> 54:07.665
Perhaps he should stay here
for a few days for observation.

54:07.786 --> 54:10.005
May I take a look at your exercise yard?

54:10.122 --> 54:12.341
Oh, yes. Right out that door,
across the hall.

54:12.458 --> 54:16.304
And, Doctor, see if you can't
coax him to eat something.

54:20.632 --> 54:22.555
Doctor, I wish you'd look at Emmylou.

54:22.676 --> 54:26.397
I'm not the doctor.
I'm here for treatment myself.

54:26.513 --> 54:27.514
I beg your pardon?

54:27.639 --> 54:29.141
Your wife thinks
you ought to leave the dog

54:29.266 --> 54:31.234
- for observation.
- That woman's not my wife.

54:44.865 --> 54:47.118
Ferris was there when I got back.
He knew about Frank's letter.

54:47.242 --> 54:50.041
Well, that doesn't surprise me.
I knew he'd check that.

54:50.162 --> 54:53.587
Danny, I've been thinking. Why did
Frank send it to Hart & Winston's?

54:53.707 --> 54:55.004
He didn't want it intercepted.

54:55.125 --> 54:56.752
Why not leave it with Sammy Chung, then?

54:56.877 --> 54:58.971
Or give it to anybody he knew
who'd bring it to me?

54:59.087 --> 55:00.634
Why Maibus at the store?

55:00.756 --> 55:03.179
You mean you think there's a reason?
Something you missed?

55:03.300 --> 55:06.600
Yes, something I didn't see.
Something I overlooked.

55:06.720 --> 55:09.599
- Driver, take us to Hart & Winston.
- OK.

55:23.612 --> 55:25.831
Weary, bitter, cynical.

55:31.495 --> 55:33.543
Fresh, eager and hopeful.

55:33.664 --> 55:35.758
The two Eleanors.

55:37.251 --> 55:38.628
Now I remember.

55:38.752 --> 55:41.175
One day, on the beach at Carmel,
just after we were married,

55:41.296 --> 55:42.616
Frank made a mermaid out of sand.

55:42.714 --> 55:45.593
It was supposed to be me, and a big
wave came up and washed it away,

55:45.717 --> 55:47.685
and he said, "Well, I've lost you",

55:47.803 --> 55:49.851
and I said, "You'll never lose me,
Frank. I won't let you."

55:49.972 --> 55:52.225
That's what he meant in the letter.
It wasn't a quarrel.

55:52.349 --> 55:54.351
This means something to you.
You know where he is?

55:54.476 --> 55:56.945
- I'll take you there.
- Inspector Ferris wants to see you.

55:57.062 --> 55:59.030
- Why?
- Look, he wants to see you.

55:59.147 --> 56:01.445
- Where?
- Later.

56:36.602 --> 56:39.606
I'm sorry to have to ask you to do this,
Mrs. Johnson.

56:39.730 --> 56:43.610
This man was found in an alley behind
a gin mill on the Embarcadero.

56:43.734 --> 56:45.828
He'd been brutally beaten to death.

56:45.944 --> 56:47.287
He wasn't wearing a trench coat,

56:47.404 --> 56:50.783
but he was wearing
a seaman's cap and jacket.

56:50.908 --> 56:54.037
From what I remember
of your husband, it could be him.

56:54.161 --> 56:55.913
I'm not sure.

56:56.038 --> 56:59.463
So, I'll have to ask you to make
a positive identification.

57:30.489 --> 57:32.867
Let her alone.

57:32.991 --> 57:35.210
There goes the Freeman case.

57:35.327 --> 57:37.830
Two witnesses. Two dead men.

57:39.331 --> 57:41.880
That's the way it goes sometimes.

57:47.881 --> 57:51.852
Eleanor, anything that I could say
would just be words.

57:55.180 --> 57:58.400
Danny, that wasn't Frank.

57:59.476 --> 58:00.728
For a quick moment, I thought it was

58:00.852 --> 58:03.480
and I felt things
I didn't know I could feel.

58:03.605 --> 58:08.486
What was I holding out for?
Why didn't I learn to understand him?

58:08.610 --> 58:12.490
Why don't we give freely of ourselves
when we can?

58:12.614 --> 58:15.367
"If only I had another chance," I thought.

58:15.492 --> 58:17.665
Then I saw it wasn't Frank and I fainted.

58:17.786 --> 58:20.505
Congratulations on your performance.

58:21.915 --> 58:24.088
But it wasn't an act. I really did faint.

58:26.169 --> 58:27.386
Where is he?

58:27.504 --> 58:30.633
At the amusement park at the beach.

58:43.520 --> 58:47.525
You were there when it happened.
Why can't you talk?

58:48.650 --> 58:50.243
That Johnson dame's a smart cookie.

58:50.360 --> 58:51.361
Yeah.

58:51.486 --> 58:54.080
I wonder where she got the idea
of passing that stiff off as her husband.

58:54.197 --> 58:56.700
Somebody had to... Pass him off?

58:56.825 --> 58:59.795
Sure, the guy she identified
was a second mate off a tanker.

58:59.911 --> 59:01.834
Just been paid off.
Somebody rolled him for his dough.

59:01.955 --> 59:05.835
- Why wasn't I told?
- The fingerprint report just came.

59:05.959 --> 59:07.927
Keep people on her, knucklehead.

59:08.045 --> 59:10.889
Get down to the taxi stand, check
and find out where they took her.

59:20.390 --> 59:22.392
$1.80, sir.

59:28.857 --> 59:30.384
Hey, Mac. Watch my cab, will you?

59:30.484 --> 59:32.782
- I want to get a hamburger.
- OK, bud.

59:48.877 --> 59:50.971
Put this on right away.

59:52.422 --> 59:56.643
All units in the Bay Area, be on the
lookout for one yellow cab, number 323.

59:56.760 --> 59:58.353
License number in the 7 column.

59:58.470 --> 01:00:00.347
49 Frank 762.

01:00:00.472 --> 01:00:03.066
Left Hall of Justice
approximately 6:30 pm this date.

01:00:12.484 --> 01:00:16.034
Right down there, beyond that railing,
at the sand sculptures.

01:00:19.783 --> 01:00:23.663
He's been waiting for me all day,
thinking I wouldn't remember.

01:00:23.787 --> 01:00:24.788
I almost didn't.

01:00:24.913 --> 01:00:26.540
- No.
- What is it?

01:00:26.665 --> 01:00:30.215
I couldn't talk to him there.
There's too many people around.

01:00:30.335 --> 01:00:32.087
Couldn't get the kind of story I want.

01:00:32.212 --> 01:00:36.012
I know where I can meet him
and nobody will bother us.

01:00:40.470 --> 01:00:42.393
Oh, look at the sand sculpture.

01:00:42.514 --> 01:00:46.690
Oh, I had an uncle that used to make
statues. Only he made them out of ice.

01:00:46.810 --> 01:00:49.859
Small donation for the artist
would be appreciated.

01:00:49.980 --> 01:00:52.950
- Here you are!
- Thank you.

01:01:25.765 --> 01:01:27.733
Yeah?

01:01:30.604 --> 01:01:34.074
This thing's beginning to boil.
We'll be right down.

01:01:34.191 --> 01:01:36.819
We're going to the beach.
Come on, Rembrandt.

01:01:36.943 --> 01:01:41.039
What my eyes miss,
your nose will smell. Come on.

01:02:09.142 --> 01:02:11.611
I don't like this place.

01:02:11.728 --> 01:02:15.608
It's a good spot. I used to come here
with a girl when I was a kid.

01:02:15.732 --> 01:02:18.201
It's more frightening than romantic.

01:02:18.318 --> 01:02:20.946
That's the way love is when you're young.

01:02:21.071 --> 01:02:22.823
How life is when you're older.

01:02:22.948 --> 01:02:24.916
I'll tell Frank where you are.

01:02:26.785 --> 01:02:28.985
You sure you want to start over again
with your husband?

01:02:29.037 --> 01:02:32.337
I'm sure I want to try.
I'm not sure what he wants.

01:02:32.457 --> 01:02:34.175
Supposing he doesn't want to?

01:02:34.292 --> 01:02:37.091
Then I'll let him go and
he'll never know how I feel about him.

01:02:39.047 --> 01:02:41.891
You think people can turn back
and you're going to try?

01:02:42.676 --> 01:02:44.269
I know better.

01:02:44.386 --> 01:02:46.388
You're too cynical. It's your profession.

01:02:46.513 --> 01:02:49.608
It's too late now to change my profession.

01:02:49.724 --> 01:02:51.647
OK.

01:02:51.768 --> 01:02:53.111
Go ahead. Send him here.

01:02:53.228 --> 01:02:54.901
- I'll bring him.
- No.

01:02:56.106 --> 01:02:58.484
What's a matter with you?
Don't you still want the story?

01:03:00.151 --> 01:03:04.201
I guess I got to have the story,
but my way.

01:03:05.115 --> 01:03:07.413
You send him back.
I want to see him alone first.

01:03:07.534 --> 01:03:10.003
If you want the money,
I talk to him alone.

01:03:10.120 --> 01:03:13.169
All right, if that's the way you want it,
I'll send him.

01:03:42.819 --> 01:03:45.038
Fellers, get over there
and cover the pier side.

01:03:45.155 --> 01:03:46.623
You get up there, make like a gate.

01:03:46.740 --> 01:03:48.208
If Johnson tries to come through,
arrest him.

01:03:48.325 --> 01:03:49.326
What charge?

01:03:49.451 --> 01:03:51.078
For failing to curb his dog
in a public park.

01:03:51.202 --> 01:03:53.625
I'm coming in
from the other end of the pier.

01:03:59.419 --> 01:04:02.093
Hey! How we doing?

01:04:02.213 --> 01:04:03.214
$7.71.

01:04:03.340 --> 01:04:07.220
Huh? That's better than I do
on some Sundays.

01:04:07.344 --> 01:04:08.937
Thanks for taking care of things.

01:04:09.054 --> 01:04:11.148
You know, it's the first day
I've had off in years.

01:04:11.264 --> 01:04:12.982
You know what I've been doing all day?

01:04:13.099 --> 01:04:14.442
Riding back and forth, back and forth,

01:04:14.559 --> 01:04:17.688
between here and Sausalito
on my old ferry boat.

01:04:17.812 --> 01:04:21.157
Look, I can't stick around here
any more. I've got to get out of here.

01:04:21.274 --> 01:04:23.902
Hey, Cap, I hate to ask you
but could you...

01:04:26.529 --> 01:04:31.786
Won't take you very far. Here's
the keys to my car and the ticket.

01:04:31.910 --> 01:04:34.379
Find it over in the parkway.
The tank's full.

01:04:34.496 --> 01:04:37.420
- Thanks, Cap. I'll get it back to you.
- You better.

01:05:05.443 --> 01:05:07.616
Frank?

01:05:07.737 --> 01:05:08.738
Beg your pardon, lady?

01:05:08.863 --> 01:05:10.911
Where's Frank? What happened to him?

01:05:11.032 --> 01:05:13.080
- Who?
- Frank Johnson.

01:05:13.952 --> 01:05:16.796
Never heard of him.

01:05:31.553 --> 01:05:33.897
Sorry, Mrs. Johnson,
but I had to be careful.

01:05:34.013 --> 01:05:36.311
Frank waited all day and said
he couldn't wait any longer.

01:05:36.433 --> 01:05:38.273
So, I loaned him my car
about five minutes ago.

01:05:38.351 --> 01:05:39.352
Where did he go?

01:05:39.477 --> 01:05:41.104
Over at the parking lot
at the other end of the midway.

01:05:41.229 --> 01:05:42.230
Thank you.

01:05:50.447 --> 01:05:52.165
I lost a bet with myself.

01:05:52.282 --> 01:05:54.330
Did you want to win?

01:05:57.662 --> 01:05:59.005
As ordered, delivered.

01:05:59.122 --> 01:06:01.045
Late as usual.

01:06:01.166 --> 01:06:03.134
But delivered.

01:06:05.086 --> 01:06:06.884
Let's get out of the light.

01:06:09.090 --> 01:06:11.934
Keep an eye out for us, will you, Cap?

01:06:21.686 --> 01:06:23.688
Why didn't you tell me about your heart?

01:06:23.813 --> 01:06:27.317
Oh, you know doctors.
They make a big deal of everything.

01:06:28.443 --> 01:06:31.037
Guess it was a silly thing to do,
writing that corny note.

01:06:31.154 --> 01:06:33.748
It sounded like you'd had
a couple of drinks.

01:06:33.865 --> 01:06:34.866
I had.

01:06:34.991 --> 01:06:38.621
By the time I'd finished the drinks and
the letter, I was a pretty sad character.

01:06:40.163 --> 01:06:43.292
Well, I can't hide out here forever.

01:06:43.416 --> 01:06:45.009
Would you want to?

01:06:45.126 --> 01:06:48.881
I can get a job in another town.
I'm a pretty fair window trimmer.

01:06:49.005 --> 01:06:53.886
Pretty good artist, too.
We've got to pull out of this.

01:06:54.010 --> 01:06:55.010
We?

01:06:55.094 --> 01:06:58.974
Yes. If this excitement hasn't
killed you, I'm sure I can't.

01:06:59.098 --> 01:07:00.896
We'll get out of town
where you'll be safe.

01:07:01.017 --> 01:07:02.940
Can't go very far.

01:07:03.061 --> 01:07:06.782
I've got seven dollars and 71 cents.
Borrowed that from the Captain.

01:07:06.898 --> 01:07:09.071
There's a fellow named Legget,
a reporter from The Graphic.

01:07:09.192 --> 01:07:13.072
He helped me find you. He's promised
to give you $1,000 for an exclusive.

01:07:13.196 --> 01:07:15.076
That's a lot of money
for the little I can tell.

01:07:15.156 --> 01:07:18.456
Well, his paper must think it's worth it
so why look a gift horse in the mouth?

01:07:18.576 --> 01:07:19.577
Where is he?

01:07:19.702 --> 01:07:21.375
Over by the roller coaster.
Come on. I'll show you.

01:07:21.496 --> 01:07:23.089
Hey, you! Turn around.

01:07:23.206 --> 01:07:24.766
You know an artist named Frank Johnson?

01:07:24.791 --> 01:07:27.089
- Who?
- Frank Johnson.

01:07:27.210 --> 01:07:31.056
An artist. Did a sketch of you. I saw it.

01:07:31.172 --> 01:07:33.266
Could be, but I don't remember.

01:07:33.383 --> 01:07:36.978
See, I just work here.
Used to be a ferryboat captain, though.

01:07:55.530 --> 01:07:57.874
- Now where do I go?
- Over there under the roller coaster.

01:07:57.991 --> 01:08:00.119
Go all the way to the end of the walk
and duck in under the scaffolding.

01:08:00.243 --> 01:08:02.746
OK. Here's a ticket and keys
to the captain's car.

01:08:02.870 --> 01:08:03.996
It's parked down at that end
of the midway.

01:08:04.122 --> 01:08:05.123
Yes, I know.

01:08:05.248 --> 01:08:07.421
- Well, I'll meet you there.
- No, I'd better bring it here.

01:08:07.542 --> 01:08:11.638
You've got to stay out of sight.
I can't let anything happen to you now.

01:08:16.216 --> 01:08:18.515
Nothing can happen to me now.

01:08:18.636 --> 01:08:21.389
Remember that man shot at you.

01:08:21.514 --> 01:08:23.642
How did you know?
That wasn't in the paper.

01:08:23.765 --> 01:08:26.609
Ferris told me. Nobody else knows it.

01:08:26.728 --> 01:08:29.607
Nobody but the guy that fired the shots.

01:08:38.281 --> 01:08:40.408
You'd better go now.

01:08:40.533 --> 01:08:43.286
I'll be back as soon as I can.

01:08:47.582 --> 01:08:51.506
Hey, Martin. Prowl car down at the end
just got word for you to call in.

01:08:51.627 --> 01:08:53.721
Johnson hasn't passed me yet.

01:09:06.893 --> 01:09:10.773
I haven't got time to talk to him now.
That's McDonald and Murray's case.

01:09:10.897 --> 01:09:14.743
But he says he has some information
you wanted. Hold on.

01:09:15.734 --> 01:09:16.736
Hello, Inspector.

01:09:16.861 --> 01:09:18.453
Remember you asked me
to check all of Suzie's things,

01:09:18.571 --> 01:09:19.618
to see if anything was missing?

01:09:19.738 --> 01:09:22.162
Sammy, I'm busy. I'll see you tomorrow.

01:09:22.283 --> 01:09:24.331
I just wanted to tell you
that nothing was missing,

01:09:24.452 --> 01:09:26.692
except that sketch that Frank
drew on the back of a menu.

01:09:26.703 --> 01:09:29.082
- Sketch of who?
- 'I don't know.'

01:09:29.207 --> 01:09:30.754
But Suzie said it looked
like that newspaperman

01:09:30.875 --> 01:09:33.502
that was in the club this afternoon
with Mrs. Johnson.

01:09:33.627 --> 01:09:37.758
'That good notice he was going to give
us won't do Suzie any good now.'

01:09:44.846 --> 01:09:46.019
What happened? Where's Frank?

01:09:46.140 --> 01:09:48.313
He's on his way to meet you,
but Ferris is here with the dog.

01:09:48.434 --> 01:09:51.688
Oh. I thought that stiff in the morgue
was a plant.

01:09:51.813 --> 01:09:54.032
He's a pretty sharp fellow.

01:09:54.148 --> 01:09:56.492
Let's get off the midway.

01:10:10.707 --> 01:10:12.050
Come on.
They'll never look for us in here.

01:10:12.166 --> 01:10:14.339
But these things make me sick.

01:10:15.128 --> 01:10:18.428
Stay in your seats, folks.
The second ride is half fare.

01:10:18.548 --> 01:10:21.427
I'll never ride this thing again.

01:10:21.551 --> 01:10:23.474
Let's go, baby.

01:10:31.519 --> 01:10:34.944
All right, Eddie. Take it away.
Don't stand up in your seats, folks.

01:10:35.064 --> 01:10:37.988
This is the greatest thrill
of your lifetime.

01:10:48.828 --> 01:10:50.876
Ride only takes a couple of minutes.

01:10:50.997 --> 01:10:52.874
Besides, when we get to the top,
we can see if Frank's there.

01:10:52.999 --> 01:10:55.673
He must be there by now.

01:11:00.715 --> 01:11:02.592
I don't see him.

01:11:19.233 --> 01:11:21.861
- Where is he?
- I don't know!

01:11:24.071 --> 01:11:25.368
Yee-ha!

01:11:52.892 --> 01:11:55.020
Hey, buddy,
where do you think you're going?

01:12:34.100 --> 01:12:36.068
The second ride is only half fare.

01:12:36.185 --> 01:12:39.689
- Want to go again, baby?
- I wouldn't go again for the admiral.

01:12:39.814 --> 01:12:42.283
You stay on for another ride.
I'll go see what's happened to Frank.

01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:43.401
I want to go with you.

01:12:43.526 --> 01:12:45.807
No, with Ferris outside,
together we'd be too conspicuous.

01:12:45.903 --> 01:12:47.503
- But, Danny...
- Ferris traced you here.

01:12:47.613 --> 01:12:50.332
If he found you,
someone else could follow you too.

01:12:50.449 --> 01:12:53.544
- Second ride half fare.
- Lady will go again.

01:12:53.661 --> 01:12:56.164
OK, Eddie, take it away.

01:12:56.289 --> 01:12:58.883
Don't forget.
Somebody shot at him last night.

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.378
They tried to kill him once,
they'll do it again.

01:13:02.962 --> 01:13:05.556
'Don't forget.
Somebody shot at him last night.

01:13:05.673 --> 01:13:08.347
'They tried to kill him once,
they'll do it again.'

01:13:08.467 --> 01:13:11.141
'Nobody knows that except your husband,
the killer, and now you.

01:13:11.262 --> 01:13:14.335
'Nobody knows that except your husband,
the killer, and now you.'

01:13:27.236 --> 01:13:29.864
Frank! Frank, go away!

01:13:33.159 --> 01:13:35.912
Frank! Frank, go away!

01:13:39.165 --> 01:13:41.042
Oh, Frank!

01:13:41.167 --> 01:13:43.886
Frank, please go away!

01:13:50.343 --> 01:13:52.687
Frank! Frank! Frank!

01:13:54.555 --> 01:13:56.478
Frank!

01:14:22.959 --> 01:14:24.836
Frank! Frank, go away!

01:14:29.632 --> 01:14:32.226
Frank. Frank Johnson.

01:14:32.343 --> 01:14:34.596
Yeah. That you, Mr. Legget?

01:14:34.720 --> 01:14:37.974
Be careful.
There's a loose plank over here.

01:14:38.975 --> 01:14:40.022
I know.

01:14:48.275 --> 01:14:49.777
Why don't you get it over with?

01:14:59.662 --> 01:15:01.756
I don't have to, Frank.

01:15:04.166 --> 01:15:06.260
You got a bad heart.

01:15:07.878 --> 01:15:10.097
You can't stand tension.

01:15:12.717 --> 01:15:14.936
You're going to kill yourself.

01:16:00.056 --> 01:16:01.683
Second ride is half fare, folks.

01:16:01.807 --> 01:16:05.186
Take advantage of the second ride.
It's only half fare.

01:16:15.029 --> 01:16:17.623
What's your hurry, Mrs. Johnson?

01:16:58.364 --> 01:17:00.833
I had to do it, Mrs. Johnson.

01:17:00.950 --> 01:17:03.294
That's Legget down there.
Your husband's safe.

01:17:03.410 --> 01:17:06.254
- Where... where's Frank?
- Out there on the midway.
