00:39.422 --> 00:41.554

00:41.588 --> 00:43.654
Aqua Teen Hunger Force.

00:43.688 --> 00:45.587
Number One in the hood, g.

00:52.685 --> 00:53.818

Jackass.

01:05.354 --> 01:06.121
Daddy!

01:06.154 --> 01:07.520
No, no!

01:07.553 --> 01:08.786
You're uh...

01:08.820 --> 01:10.186
You're probably thinking the guy

01:10.220 --> 01:11.118
next door.

01:11.152 --> 01:12.419
Big fat guy.

01:12.452 --> 01:14.251
You take care.

01:17.350 --> 01:18.050
That's right.

01:18.083 --> 01:19.083
Get lost.

01:21.382 --> 01:22.316
Hi!

01:22.349 --> 01:24.948
Can I help you?

01:24.981 --> 01:25.748
Daddy?

01:25.781 --> 01:27.247
I don't think so.

01:27.280 --> 01:28.280
But you do look like someone I

01:28.314 --> 01:29.214
know.

01:29.247 --> 01:30.080
Mommy?

01:30.114 --> 01:30.946
But that's impossible 'cause

01:30.979 --> 01:32.113
he has no penis.

01:32.146 --> 01:33.712
Hey, is he gone?!

01:33.745 --> 01:34.412
No.

01:34.445 --> 01:35.378
He's right here.

01:35.412 --> 01:36.045
You want to talk to him?

01:36.078 --> 01:36.712
No, no!

01:36.745 --> 01:37.511
Daddy!

01:37.544 --> 01:38.211
I don't!

01:38.244 --> 01:38.944
Send him away.

01:38.977 --> 01:39.711
Hey, little guy.

01:39.744 --> 01:40.676
Why don't you come in for a bit.

01:40.710 --> 01:41.776
It must be hot outside.

01:41.810 --> 01:42.710
Daddy?!

01:42.743 --> 01:43.442
Don't do it--

01:43.475 --> 01:44.475
hey, hey!

01:44.509 --> 01:46.142
We were just talking about you.

01:46.175 --> 01:46.808
Yay!

01:46.841 --> 01:48.174
Daddy, Daddy, up, please!

01:48.208 --> 01:49.374
Daddy, Daddy, up, please!

01:49.408 --> 01:50.040
Yay!

01:50.073 --> 01:50.840
Daddy, Daddy, Daddy!

01:50.873 --> 01:51.873
Up, please, please, please!

01:51.907 --> 01:52.873
Up, up, up!

01:52.907 --> 01:53.739
Please, please, please!

01:53.772 --> 01:54.672
Daddy...

01:54.706 --> 01:55.372
Pick him up, Shake.

01:55.406 --> 01:56.206
He wants to be picked up.

01:56.239 --> 01:57.238
You pick him up.

01:57.271 --> 01:58.005
He's your son.

01:58.038 --> 01:59.071
...Please, please, please.

01:59.105 --> 01:59.837
Come here, little man.

01:59.870 --> 02:00.570
Look at you.

02:00.604 --> 02:02.037
Aagh!

02:02.070 --> 02:03.143
You gotta wash your hands

02:03.176 --> 02:04.876
before you pick a baby up.

02:04.909 --> 02:06.475
He can see the bacteria burning

02:06.508 --> 02:07.875
into his flesh.

02:07.908 --> 02:09.142
What's your name, little man?

02:09.175 --> 02:10.640
I don't have a name.

02:10.674 --> 02:12.474
No one ever gave me one.

02:12.507 --> 02:13.640
Well, Shake...

02:13.673 --> 02:14.906
Aren't you gonna name your son?

02:14.940 --> 02:15.872
Daddy, Daddy, Daddy!

02:15.905 --> 02:16.672
Aw!

02:16.705 --> 02:17.939
Is this your bastard?

02:17.972 --> 02:19.637
Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad, Daddy!

02:19.671 --> 02:20.504
He ain't mine!

02:20.537 --> 02:21.637
Well, now that you say it,

02:21.671 --> 02:22.570
I can totally see the

02:22.603 --> 02:24.037
resemblance, especially in,

02:24.070 --> 02:25.769
like, the cup region.

02:25.802 --> 02:26.702
I don't know if you can see it,

02:26.736 --> 02:28.202
but I can definitely see you

02:28.236 --> 02:29.835
guys both looking cup-like.

02:29.868 --> 02:31.101
Look, yes.

02:31.135 --> 02:33.567
I have banged hundreds of broads

02:33.600 --> 02:35.466
internationally.

02:35.499 --> 02:37.899
But know this: I wrap my rascal

02:37.933 --> 02:40.465
two times 'cause I like it to be

02:40.498 --> 02:42.531
joyless and without sensation as

02:42.564 --> 02:44.731
a way of punishing supermodels.

02:44.764 --> 02:45.696
Yeah, well, let's see what a

02:45.730 --> 02:47.396
DNA test would say about that.

02:47.430 --> 02:49.262
Oh, that's where it starts.

02:49.295 --> 02:51.329
Then pretty soon he's gonna want

02:51.362 --> 02:53.961
65 cents for bus fare, liquor

02:53.994 --> 02:55.160
for his stomach.

02:55.193 --> 02:56.727
You know, I counsel dogs in

02:56.760 --> 02:58.027
better shape than you.

02:58.060 --> 02:59.192
Free-jacking all around here

02:59.226 --> 03:00.726
like you're Mick Jagger.

03:00.759 --> 03:01.691
Listen!

03:01.725 --> 03:03.198
Why don't you go hustle on down

03:03.231 --> 03:04.531
to the soup kitchen, Mick.

03:06.097 --> 03:06.730
Wait a minute!

03:06.764 --> 03:07.397
Wait!

03:07.430 --> 03:08.063
Don't go!

03:08.096 --> 03:08.829
Come back!

03:08.863 --> 03:10.196
Come back, Little Shake!

03:13.128 --> 03:14.661
Daddy!

03:14.694 --> 03:16.327
Daddy no want me.

03:16.361 --> 03:18.893
I'm gonna take a bus to Reno.

03:18.926 --> 03:19.726
Oh, no.

03:19.760 --> 03:20.826
That won't do.

03:20.860 --> 03:21.659
Why don't you just stay here

03:21.692 --> 03:23.559
with us until you're old enough

03:23.592 --> 03:24.758
to leave home.

03:24.791 --> 03:25.491
Hurray!

03:25.524 --> 03:26.891
Daddy, Daddy, Daddy, Daddy,

03:26.924 --> 03:27.557
Daddy!

03:27.590 --> 03:28.290
Hurray!

03:28.323 --> 03:29.157
Yeah.

03:29.190 --> 03:30.123
Huzzah.

03:30.157 --> 03:30.956
I want to name him.

03:30.989 --> 03:31.722
Can I name him?

03:31.756 --> 03:32.622
No, he's my son.

03:32.656 --> 03:33.456
I--no!

03:33.489 --> 03:34.455
No, he's not my son!

03:34.488 --> 03:35.655
Nobody can prove that.

03:35.688 --> 03:37.387
I'm gonna name you

03:37.420 --> 03:41.853
Jesus Ezekial Jesus.

03:41.886 --> 03:43.486
And that's from the Bible.

03:43.519 --> 03:46.352
Ez-zek-kial?

03:46.385 --> 03:47.651
That's a good name.

03:47.684 --> 03:48.617
Ezekial.

03:48.651 --> 03:49.284
Ezekial!

03:49.317 --> 03:49.984
I am Ezekial!

03:50.017 --> 03:50.650
That is me!

03:50.683 --> 03:52.116
Ezekial is--I am.

03:52.150 --> 03:53.016
Let's everybody have a group

03:53.050 --> 03:54.482
hug for Ezekial.

03:54.515 --> 03:55.149
Group hug!

03:55.182 --> 03:56.149
Group hug!

03:56.182 --> 03:57.981
Group hug for Ezekial!

03:58.014 --> 03:58.981
I'm the sherriff!

03:59.014 --> 04:00.147
Come on in here, Shake.

04:00.180 --> 04:02.387
Yeah, sit and spin.

04:02.420 --> 04:03.053
Swimming!

04:03.087 --> 04:03.852
Yay!

04:03.886 --> 04:04.552
Swimming!

04:04.586 --> 04:05.519
Hey, Zeke, over here.

04:05.552 --> 04:06.851
Swimming, yay!

04:06.885 --> 04:07.651
Ha ha.

04:07.685 --> 04:08.918
A booga-booga-booga-boo!

04:08.951 --> 04:09.784
A booga-booga-booga!

04:09.817 --> 04:11.817
No booga-booga!

04:11.850 --> 04:13.349
No booga-booga!

04:13.383 --> 04:14.183
Meatwad, he can speak

04:14.216 --> 04:15.483
English, you know.

04:15.516 --> 04:16.947
Booga-booga-booga.

04:16.982 --> 04:18.182
Well, that is English.

04:18.214 --> 04:19.214
Come on, Zekey!

04:19.248 --> 04:20.414
Swim to Papa.

04:20.447 --> 04:21.581
Oh, Papa, Papa!

04:21.613 --> 04:22.247
Swimming.

04:22.281 --> 04:23.213
Come on, you can do it.

04:23.246 --> 04:25.080
There you go, Shake.

04:25.113 --> 04:25.980
See?

04:26.012 --> 04:26.912
Swimming.

04:26.945 --> 04:28.745
And here he goes.

04:28.779 --> 04:29.478
No, Shake.

04:29.511 --> 04:30.611
Yes, Frylock.

04:30.644 --> 04:31.544
Keep your chin up.

04:31.578 --> 04:32.643
You don't want to breathe that

04:32.677 --> 04:33.677
in.

04:34.577 --> 04:36.142
Zeke, are you ok?!

04:36.175 --> 04:37.375
I am a swimmer!

04:37.409 --> 04:38.209
He could have drown in there,

04:38.242 --> 04:38.942
Shake!

04:38.975 --> 04:39.708
Meatwad's right!

04:39.741 --> 04:40.608
I know.

04:40.641 --> 04:42.141
That's why I did it.

04:42.175 --> 04:44.374
We can't afford college.

04:44.407 --> 04:45.340
Shake's right.

04:45.374 --> 04:46.573
Zeke, I'm so sorry.

04:46.606 --> 04:47.439
Look, will y'all both hold

04:47.473 --> 04:48.306
on?

04:48.339 --> 04:49.572
No one's going to college, all

04:49.605 --> 04:50.438
right?

04:50.472 --> 04:51.405
When he gets to be old enough,

04:51.438 --> 04:52.471
he can work security at the

04:52.504 --> 04:53.237
mall.

04:53.271 --> 04:54.837
Yay, security at the mall!

04:54.871 --> 04:56.370
I'm gonna shine a flashlight.

04:56.403 --> 04:59.102
My son is not gonna be secure

04:59.135 --> 05:00.469
for anything!

05:00.502 --> 05:02.908
He is going to be a professional

05:02.941 --> 05:05.407
basketball star because that is

05:05.440 --> 05:07.940
what his what his father demands

05:07.973 --> 05:09.106
of him.

05:09.139 --> 05:09.772
Ready?

05:09.806 --> 05:10.472
Yes!

05:10.506 --> 05:11.705
Achieve on 3.

05:11.738 --> 05:12.371

Hey, watch the one!

05:21.502 --> 05:22.168
Come on!

05:22.202 --> 05:23.035
They got us in a Zone D!

05:23.068 --> 05:25.267
Will you get off me, Shake?!

05:25.301 --> 05:26.401
Personal Foul!

05:26.434 --> 05:27.801
I cannot believe you did this!

05:27.834 --> 05:28.966
This is a friendly game, you

05:29.000 --> 05:29.833
asshole!

05:29.866 --> 05:30.766
Go on, feed me the rock.

05:30.800 --> 05:31.499
I'm down low.

05:31.532 --> 05:32.399
7 foul shots.

05:32.432 --> 05:33.232
Meatwad, your man's free over

05:33.265 --> 05:33.899
there.

05:33.932 --> 05:34.598
Get your man, Meatwad.

05:34.631 --> 05:35.431
Shut up, boy.

05:35.464 --> 05:36.598
I got my man boxed in over here.

05:36.631 --> 05:37.963
You deal with your own business.

05:37.997 --> 05:39.897
I want to play race car.

05:39.930 --> 05:40.730
What are you doing standing

05:40.763 --> 05:41.529
around?!

05:41.562 --> 05:42.462
Run to it!

05:42.496 --> 05:43.629
Don't let the ball come to you.

05:43.662 --> 05:44.795
You go to the ball!

05:44.828 --> 05:45.761
Now, now, shoot!

05:45.795 --> 05:46.661
The clock's ticking!

05:46.695 --> 05:48.460
Two, one, shoot!

05:48.494 --> 05:51.559
Uhn!

05:51.593 --> 05:52.659
Come on!

05:52.693 --> 05:53.359
Come on!

05:53.393 --> 05:55.558
In the hole!

05:55.592 --> 05:57.058

06:01.190 --> 06:03.230
Yay!

06:03.263 --> 06:07.961
Yay!

06:07.994 --> 06:10.193

Oh!

You suck at basketball!

06:24.523 --> 06:25.156
Uhn!

06:25.189 --> 06:25.956
Boom!

06:25.989 --> 06:28.222
Go back to your mama!

06:28.255 --> 06:29.821
Uhn!

06:29.854 --> 06:30.754
Uhn!

06:35.834 --> 06:37.033
Come here.

06:39.953 --> 06:41.519
Why do you disappoint me?

06:41.553 --> 06:44.218
Second by second, you waste my

06:44.252 --> 06:44.885
time.

06:44.918 --> 06:46.317
Shake, Shake, Shake,

06:46.351 --> 06:47.617
let's just have some fun out

06:47.651 --> 06:48.684
here, ok?

06:48.717 --> 06:49.616
Why?

06:49.650 --> 06:50.983
He sucks.

06:51.016 --> 06:52.116
Come on, Sucky.

06:52.150 --> 06:53.749
Before you ruin the entirety of

06:53.782 --> 06:54.549
my future.

06:54.582 --> 06:55.249
Shake--

06:55.282 --> 06:56.181
the only reason God doesn't

06:56.214 --> 06:57.448
erase you from the face of the

06:57.481 --> 06:59.580
Earth is because you amuse Him

06:59.613 --> 07:00.413
somehow.

07:00.447 --> 07:01.147
Shake, you're out of line

07:01.180 --> 07:01.847
now.

07:01.880 --> 07:02.719
Don't you tell me who's out

07:02.752 --> 07:03.519
of line.

07:03.552 --> 07:04.452
I'm his father.

07:04.486 --> 07:07.151
I know what's right for him.

07:07.185 --> 07:08.385
All right, pal,

07:08.418 --> 07:09.350
you ready?

07:09.384 --> 07:10.250
Yes!

07:10.284 --> 07:11.650
One, two--

07:11.684 --> 07:14.016
Go Team Shake!

07:14.049 --> 07:15.382
Ok.

07:15.415 --> 07:17.415
Second serve now.

07:17.448 --> 07:19.681
Uhn!

07:19.714 --> 07:20.481
Ok.

07:20.514 --> 07:21.214
Game.

07:21.247 --> 07:22.213
Hey, hey, foot-faulted.

07:22.246 --> 07:23.380
He foot-faulted!

07:23.413 --> 07:24.446
I am a tennis star!

07:24.480 --> 07:25.279
No, no, no, no, no!

07:25.312 --> 07:26.379
Don't look at your feet!

07:26.412 --> 07:28.478
Keep your eye on the ball and

07:28.511 --> 07:30.211
then maybe it won't go sailing

07:30.244 --> 07:32.543
off over the fence, you see?

07:34.543 --> 07:35.442
But you hit it over the

07:35.476 --> 07:36.209
fence, boy.

07:36.242 --> 07:36.909
I saw it.

07:36.942 --> 07:37.842
Please do not undercut me in

07:37.876 --> 07:39.441
front of the child.

07:39.475 --> 07:41.474
I am 30 or 40 years old, and I

07:41.507 --> 07:43.674
do not need this.

07:43.707 --> 07:44.873
Well, which one?

07:44.906 --> 07:46.339
Is you 30 or 40?

07:46.373 --> 07:47.606
I don't know.

07:47.639 --> 07:49.438
Do you understand me?!

07:51.000 --> 07:57.074

08:01.134 --> 08:02.301
Thank you.

08:02.334 --> 08:06.507
That's nice.

08:08.339 --> 08:09.172
Shake, Shake!

08:09.206 --> 08:09.972
Wake up!

08:10.006 --> 08:11.005
What are you doing?

08:11.038 --> 08:13.038
My son...

08:13.071 --> 08:14.504
He doesn't listen.

08:14.537 --> 08:15.537
Look, whatever.

08:15.570 --> 08:16.837
Get out of my car.

08:16.870 --> 08:17.869
It's freakin' 3 bucks a gal--

08:17.903 --> 08:18.603
how long have you been running

08:18.636 --> 08:19.603
this engine?

08:19.636 --> 08:20.535
What, you think I should pay for

08:20.568 --> 08:21.668
this?

08:21.702 --> 08:22.702
No.

08:22.735 --> 08:23.667
Yeah, that's right.

08:23.701 --> 08:24.501
You're dead.

08:24.534 --> 08:25.301
You don't have to worry about

08:25.334 --> 08:26.001
it.

08:26.034 --> 08:26.933
Meanwhile, your bowels are

08:26.966 --> 08:28.633
leaking all over the dash,

08:28.666 --> 08:30.000
staining my shag carpet.

08:30.033 --> 08:32.032
That's freakin' authentic red

08:32.065 --> 08:32.698
pleather.

08:32.732 --> 08:34.530
That ain't cheap!

08:34.563 --> 08:36.331
Yeah.

08:36.364 --> 08:37.897
Smells like freakin' exhaust

08:37.929 --> 08:38.597
in here.

08:38.630 --> 08:40.562
You know why I had car wash

08:40.596 --> 08:42.129
people put Cocoa Butter smell in

08:42.162 --> 08:42.996
there?

08:43.029 --> 08:44.561
Because I want prostitutes to

08:44.595 --> 08:45.495
feel welcome.

08:45.528 --> 08:46.760
I don't want them to feel like

08:46.794 --> 08:48.927
it's a deathtrap.

08:48.960 --> 08:50.959
I'm sorry, Carl.

08:50.993 --> 08:55.325
It appears I failed you as well.

08:55.358 --> 08:56.257
Look.

08:56.291 --> 08:57.491
I'm sorry.

08:57.524 --> 08:58.924
I should not have unloaded on

08:58.957 --> 09:00.423
you like that.

09:00.456 --> 09:02.795
Here's a steak knife.

09:02.829 --> 09:04.429
Go kill yourself on your lawn.

09:04.462 --> 09:05.462
Hey, Shake,

09:05.495 --> 09:06.628
what you doing?

09:06.661 --> 09:08.161
I only want my son to feel

09:08.194 --> 09:09.627
guilty for what he's doing to

09:09.660 --> 09:10.693
me.

09:10.727 --> 09:12.559
Drag him out here...

09:12.592 --> 09:14.059
So he can watch me slit my own

09:14.092 --> 09:14.992
throat.

09:15.026 --> 09:16.591
Oh, he's inside

09:16.625 --> 09:18.646
slaying the Chess Dragon.

09:32.320 --> 09:35.919
King e-2 to e-3.

09:35.952 --> 09:37.952
Bishop e-5 to d-4.

09:37.985 --> 09:41.618
Check.

09:41.651 --> 09:45.382
King e-3 to e-103.

09:45.416 --> 09:46.316
You can't do that!

09:46.349 --> 09:47.782
That square does not exist!

09:47.816 --> 09:49.415
That is a blatant violation of

09:49.448 --> 09:51.281
the governing rules!

09:51.315 --> 09:54.514
king f-u to c-k.

09:54.547 --> 09:55.446
Yeah!

09:55.479 --> 09:56.513
Checkmate!

09:56.546 --> 09:57.979
You're the hippopotamus!

10:05.650 --> 10:06.883
All right!

10:06.916 --> 10:08.149
Yeah, Zeke!

10:08.182 --> 10:09.715
Ain't nobody never beat Chess

10:09.749 --> 10:10.515
Dragon.

10:10.549 --> 10:11.548
Not even me--

10:11.581 --> 10:12.948
and I'm retarded.

10:12.981 --> 10:13.714
This little guy beat Chess

10:13.748 --> 10:14.413
Dragon?

10:14.447 --> 10:15.313
That's right!

10:15.347 --> 10:16.713
My son!

10:16.747 --> 10:20.646
My seed hath slain the Chess

10:20.679 --> 10:21.978
Dragon!

10:22.011 --> 10:22.945
Yeah.

10:22.978 --> 10:24.177
Uh, about that,

10:24.210 --> 10:25.044
we need to talk.

10:25.077 --> 10:26.377
What's there to talk about?

10:26.410 --> 10:28.509
The only talk I have is with the

10:28.543 --> 10:29.843
Olympic committee.

10:29.876 --> 10:31.708
No, I mean he's not your son.

10:31.742 --> 10:34.274
I know you never had sex.

10:34.307 --> 10:35.074
Ha.

10:35.107 --> 10:36.074
I've hit that.

10:36.107 --> 10:37.806
Ha ha.

10:37.840 --> 10:41.072
Hit what?

10:41.105 --> 10:41.739
Booty.

10:41.772 --> 10:42.405
What?

10:42.439 --> 10:43.172
Where?

10:43.205 --> 10:44.538
Who?

10:44.571 --> 10:45.438
With what?

10:45.471 --> 10:46.704
I will address each question

10:46.738 --> 10:48.037
as the time comes.

10:48.070 --> 10:49.770
Look, I checked your DNA when

10:49.803 --> 10:50.669
you were passed out in Carl's

10:50.702 --> 10:51.369
car.

10:51.402 --> 10:52.202
There's no match.

10:52.236 --> 10:53.202
Vroom!

10:53.236 --> 10:54.801
In fact, Zeke is older than

10:54.835 --> 10:55.668
you are.

10:55.701 --> 10:57.567
I'm 4,000 years old!

10:57.600 --> 10:58.634
Right.

10:58.667 --> 11:00.799
Like there's two talking

11:00.833 --> 11:01.966
milk shakes.

11:04.605 --> 11:05.472
Flying!

11:05.505 --> 11:06.537
Flying!

11:06.571 --> 11:10.103
I'm having an adventure!

11:10.136 --> 11:10.836
There were.

11:10.870 --> 11:12.902
F-finger puppets

11:12.935 --> 11:15.569
f-f-f-finger puppets

11:15.602 --> 11:18.201
f-finger puppets

11:18.234 --> 11:20.967
f-f-f-f-finger puppets

11:21.000 --> 11:23.166
f-f-finger puppets
