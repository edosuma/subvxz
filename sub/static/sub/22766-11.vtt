38:08.242 --> 38:09.709
Fast.

38:09.829 --> 38:13.218
No, you moved right with me.
Spot-on with the craft.

38:13.398 --> 38:15.008
Thanks.

38:15.467 --> 38:18.258
So... which of your myriad girlfriends

38:18.283 --> 38:19.801
gets Dr. Rhodes tonight?

38:19.826 --> 38:21.314
[CHUCKLES] Yeah, no.

38:21.339 --> 38:23.624
Tonight, it is just
me and Jimmy Fallon.

38:23.649 --> 38:26.733
I've gotta... I gotta
pace myself, you know?

38:28.463 --> 38:30.698
You're a real mystery.

38:30.723 --> 38:33.124
You used to be such a one-woman guy.

38:33.691 --> 38:36.329
Yeah, well, that didn't work
out particularly well, did it?

38:38.043 --> 38:40.612
- [DOOR OPENS]
- Ah...

38:40.827 --> 38:42.706
Aortic dissection.

38:42.731 --> 38:44.365
Very often fatal.

38:44.390 --> 38:45.880
Mazel tov to you both.

38:45.919 --> 38:47.376
Thank you.

38:48.727 --> 38:51.329
I emailed you a case: conjoined twins.

38:51.354 --> 38:53.253
We plan to separate
them in about a month.

38:53.278 --> 38:55.529
It's going to be a long
and difficult procedure,

38:55.554 --> 38:57.238
involving several departments.

38:57.263 --> 38:58.931
I am putting together our team.

38:58.956 --> 39:01.808
- I look forward to it.
- Actually, I haven't decided

39:01.833 --> 39:03.838
which of my fellows
I'm going to include,

39:03.863 --> 39:06.405
but I wanted everyone to be au courant.

39:06.787 --> 39:09.222
- Sure.
- Hm.

39:11.572 --> 39:13.961
You know, we often say mazel tov

39:13.986 --> 39:15.887
as an offer of congratulations,

39:15.912 --> 39:18.534
but it literally means "good luck".

39:23.788 --> 39:26.335
It sounds like he's only
going to bring on one of us.

39:26.360 --> 39:27.818
Yeah.

39:27.843 --> 39:31.307
You shouldn't have invited me
into the aortic dissection.

39:31.332 --> 39:33.692
You could've grabbed all
the glory for yourself.

39:33.717 --> 39:35.818

39:35.843 --> 39:37.611
Gotten a leg up.

39:37.673 --> 39:39.140
<i>♪ </i>

39:39.165 --> 39:41.314
That's what I get for hedging my bet.

39:41.591 --> 39:45.394
Yeah, it's... better to go all-in.
