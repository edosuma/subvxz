WEBVTT

00:03.862 --> 00:07.662
Captain's Log, Stardate 44614.6.

00:07.699 --> 00:10.566
We are approaching Starbase 313
where we will pick up

00:10.602 --> 00:12.502
a shipment
of scientific equipment

00:12.537 --> 00:16.166
for transport to a Federation
outpost in the Guernica system.

00:16.207 --> 00:18.870
During the journey, we will
be hosting a special guest.

00:19.911 --> 00:22.175
Come.

00:22.281 --> 00:25.011
You wanted to see me, Captain?

00:25.050 --> 00:26.540
Yes, Mr. La Forge.

00:26.585 --> 00:29.645
It seems that the exemplary
nature of your work

00:29.688 --> 00:32.680
has caught the attention
of Starfleet Command.

00:32.723 --> 00:36.353
In fact, someone is coming
on board just to see

00:36.395 --> 00:38.863
the engine modifications
you've made.

00:38.897 --> 00:40.421
Who, Captain?

00:40.465 --> 00:41.932
The Senior Design Engineer

00:41.967 --> 00:45.027
at the Theoretical Propulsion
Group, Dr. Leah Brahms.

00:45.070 --> 00:48.733
Leah is coming here?

00:52.944 --> 00:54.571
Well, this is terrific.

00:54.613 --> 00:56.444
It is?

00:56.481 --> 00:58.472
Well, I mean, I've...

00:58.517 --> 01:02.078
studied her... schematics
for years.

01:02.120 --> 01:04.087
She was responsible for a lot

01:04.122 --> 01:06.386
of the engine design
on the Enterprise. 

01:06.425 --> 01:08.689
Well, it should be
a very enjoyable visit then.

01:08.727 --> 01:10.160
She'll be transporting on board

01:10.262 --> 01:11.854
as soon as we reach
the starbase.

01:11.897 --> 01:15.128
Would you like to greet
her on our behalf?

01:15.167 --> 01:17.158
I would love to, Captain.

01:17.202 --> 01:18.726
Thank you.

01:20.000 --> 01:26.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:34.353 --> 01:36.378
You keep picking at that uniform

01:36.421 --> 01:38.218
you're going to wear it out.

01:39.257 --> 01:41.589
I guess I am a little nervous.

01:41.626 --> 01:43.116
It's, uh... it's not every day

01:43.161 --> 01:45.186
a man comes face-to-face
with his dream.

01:45.297 --> 01:46.525
What?

01:46.565 --> 01:48.658
Okay, you remember
about a year ago

01:48.700 --> 01:51.032
when we were caught
in that booby trap

01:51.069 --> 01:52.434
the Menthars set?

01:52.471 --> 01:53.529
Mm-hmm.

01:53.572 --> 01:55.369
Okay. While we were trying
to get out of it

01:55.407 --> 01:57.807
I went down to the holodeck
to study an engine prototype

01:57.843 --> 02:00.141
that was made when the
Enterprise was first designed.

02:00.178 --> 02:04.410
And the computer... well, it
gave me an image of the engine

02:04.449 --> 02:07.941
but it also created
this hologram of the designer

02:07.986 --> 02:09.646
Dr. Leah Brahms.

02:09.687 --> 02:14.352
So, you met
a computer-simulated female?

02:14.393 --> 02:19.126
Yeah, but not an ordinary
computer-simulated female.

02:19.164 --> 02:22.156
I mean, she was brilliant,
of course, but...

02:22.267 --> 02:24.394
warm, you know... friendly

02:24.436 --> 02:29.100
and it was like we worked
as one.

02:29.141 --> 02:31.507
I would start a sentence,
she'd finish it.

02:31.543 --> 02:33.101
What I didn't think of, she did.

02:33.145 --> 02:37.548
It was just... so comfortable.

02:37.582 --> 02:38.708
Hmm.

02:38.750 --> 02:41.275
Okay, I know it was
just a holographic image

02:41.319 --> 02:43.651
but the computer was able
to incorporate

02:43.688 --> 02:46.316
personality traits
from her Starfleet record.

02:46.358 --> 02:48.849
You know, Geordi,
everybody falls in love

02:48.894 --> 02:51.192
with a fantasy
every now and then.

02:51.229 --> 02:54.198
No, no, Guinan, see,
you've got it all wrong.

02:54.232 --> 02:57.929
I'm not necessarily expecting
anything romantic here.

02:57.969 --> 03:00.199
It's just, I know, whatever...

03:00.238 --> 03:04.004
Leah Brahms and I are going
to be good friends.

03:10.182 --> 03:12.912
Dr. Brahms is ready
to transport, sir.

03:12.951 --> 03:15.249
Okay, bring her over.

03:25.564 --> 03:26.963
Hi.

03:26.998 --> 03:28.158
I mean, uh...

03:28.266 --> 03:30.393
Welcome aboard, Dr. Brahms.

03:30.435 --> 03:33.893
I'm Lieutenant Commander
Geordi La Forge

03:33.939 --> 03:35.668
Chief Engineer.

03:35.707 --> 03:37.174
La Forge.

03:37.209 --> 03:41.543
So, you're the one who's
fouled up my engine designs.

04:12.811 --> 04:17.144
Space, the final frontier.

04:17.249 --> 04:21.083
These are the voyages
of the Starship Enterprise. 

04:21.119 --> 04:23.087
Its continuing mission...

04:23.121 --> 04:27.057
to explore strange new worlds

04:27.092 --> 04:31.529
to seek out new life
and new civilizations

04:31.563 --> 04:36.057
to boldly go
where no one has gone before.

05:37.896 --> 05:40.956
The matter/anti-matter ratio
has been changed.

05:40.999 --> 05:43.832
The mixture isn't as rich
as regulations dictate.

05:43.868 --> 05:45.028
Experience has shown me

05:45.070 --> 05:46.662
that too high a ratio
diminishes efficiency.

05:46.705 --> 05:50.038
I worked with the mixture
until I found the right balance.

05:50.075 --> 05:52.873
The magnetic plasma transfer
to the warp field generators

05:52.911 --> 05:55.106
doesn't correspond
to the recommended specs.

05:55.146 --> 05:56.170
Right.

05:56.214 --> 05:57.806
Again, I adjusted the flow.

05:57.849 --> 06:00.181
Sometimes things happen
a little differently in space

06:00.251 --> 06:01.741
than they do
on the drawing board.

06:01.786 --> 06:03.219
Is that a criticism, Commander?

06:03.254 --> 06:04.687
No, of course not.

06:04.723 --> 06:06.623
It's just a well-known fact.

06:06.658 --> 06:08.455
There's theory
and there's application.

06:08.493 --> 06:10.085
They don't always jibe.

06:10.128 --> 06:12.255
You've charted a completely
new swap-out schedule

06:12.297 --> 06:13.662
for main components replacement.

06:13.698 --> 06:14.824
You bet.

06:14.866 --> 06:17.494
I found Starfleet estimates
for the MTBF units

06:17.535 --> 06:18.559
to be unrealistic.

06:18.603 --> 06:20.230
I simply determined
my own schedule

06:20.271 --> 06:23.434
based on observation
and experience.

06:23.475 --> 06:25.136
Is that going to be
your only defense, Commander?

06:25.176 --> 06:26.473
That same tired rhetoric?

06:26.511 --> 06:28.809
"Out here in the field,
we learn things

06:28.847 --> 06:31.247
you designers couldn't
possibly understand."

06:31.282 --> 06:33.512
In the first place, Doctor, I'm
not aware of needing any defense

06:33.551 --> 06:35.519
and, in the second place,
if you're determined to be...

06:35.553 --> 06:38.818
Dr. Brahms, you have
an incoming message on subspace.

06:38.857 --> 06:41.052
I'd like to hear
this message privately.

06:41.092 --> 06:42.354
In my office.

06:42.394 --> 06:43.452
Be my guest.

06:43.495 --> 06:44.689
Thank you.

06:49.000 --> 06:51.935
Commander, I am picking up
some unusual readings

06:51.970 --> 06:53.733
in the Alpha Omicron system.

06:53.772 --> 06:56.764
At this range,
all I am able to discern

06:56.808 --> 06:59.641
is that it is
an asymmetrical field

06:59.678 --> 07:00.804
of intense energy.

07:00.845 --> 07:03.245
What type
of radiation signature?

07:03.281 --> 07:05.306
Unknown, sir.

07:05.350 --> 07:08.683
The Alpha Omicron system
has yet to be charted.

07:08.720 --> 07:10.620
I recommend
we take this opportunity

07:10.655 --> 07:11.815
for further research.

07:11.856 --> 07:15.121
Well, we're
way ahead of schedule.

07:15.226 --> 07:19.754
Alter course for Alpha Omicron.

07:28.339 --> 07:31.831
Dr. Brahms, there's no reason
for us to argue.

07:31.876 --> 07:33.639
We're on the same side here.

07:33.678 --> 07:35.407
I'm aware of that.

07:35.447 --> 07:38.507
So, why don't I take you
on a little tour.

07:38.550 --> 07:40.279
Show you the adjustments
I've made

07:40.318 --> 07:41.410
why I think they work

07:41.453 --> 07:44.820
and we can begin pulling
together on this?

07:44.856 --> 07:46.551
Okay.

07:46.591 --> 07:49.856
And why not start
with the dilithium chamber.

07:53.198 --> 07:54.825
Okay?

07:54.866 --> 07:56.891
Okay.

07:56.935 --> 07:59.995
The anomaly is orbiting
the seventh planet, sir.

08:00.038 --> 08:02.268
It is a mass of plasma energy

08:02.307 --> 08:04.207
contained
within discrete boundaries

08:04.242 --> 08:06.870
by an outer covering
of silicates, actinides

08:06.911 --> 08:09.209
and carbonaceous chondrites.

08:09.247 --> 08:11.738
On screen.

08:11.783 --> 08:13.910
Magnify.

08:15.820 --> 08:18.015
Is it a ship?

08:18.056 --> 08:20.047
It does not conform
to any known design.

08:20.091 --> 08:22.616
Any records of similar phenomena
in Starfleet listings?

08:22.660 --> 08:23.627
No, sir.

08:23.661 --> 08:25.720
This has never been seen before.

08:29.601 --> 08:31.796
Ensign Rager,
ahead one quarter impulse.

08:31.836 --> 08:32.962
Aye, sir.

08:33.004 --> 08:35.472
Put us in orbit
of the seventh planet.

08:35.506 --> 08:37.065
Keep us a relative distance

08:37.107 --> 08:39.133
of ten kilometers
from the object.

08:39.177 --> 08:40.871
Alert science stations
to stand by.

08:40.912 --> 08:42.971
Tell them to coordinate
all efforts with Commander Data.

08:43.014 --> 08:44.140
Aye, sir.

08:47.852 --> 08:49.547
What happened here?

08:49.587 --> 08:50.884
Who did this?

08:50.922 --> 08:52.890
You remember, the crystal's
been reoriented

08:52.924 --> 08:54.619
to adjust the direction

08:54.659 --> 08:56.320
of the lattice structure.

08:56.361 --> 08:57.828
Remember?
Why would I remember?

08:57.862 --> 08:59.762
Right, why would you?

08:59.798 --> 09:03.097
Uh... well, the ship was
experiencing some difficulty

09:03.201 --> 09:04.930
and we made this adjustment

09:04.969 --> 09:08.427
hoping that it would work
and it did.

09:08.473 --> 09:10.532
So, it was your idea?

09:10.575 --> 09:13.601
Not exclusively, no.

09:13.645 --> 09:14.942
It's curious.

09:14.979 --> 09:19.075
This modification
was due to be introduced...

09:19.117 --> 09:21.551
In the next class starship.

09:21.586 --> 09:22.814
Yes.

09:25.924 --> 09:28.085
How did you know that?

09:28.126 --> 09:30.458
Um... I didn't.

09:30.495 --> 09:32.554
I mean...

09:32.597 --> 09:35.725
Well, it's
the next logical step, right?

09:35.767 --> 09:37.394
Listen, Doctor.

09:37.435 --> 09:39.926
Sometimes we have to fly by
the seat of our pants out here.

09:39.971 --> 09:41.802
So it stands to reason
that once in a while

09:41.840 --> 09:44.206
we're going to come up
with the same solutions you do.

09:49.681 --> 09:52.445
Listen,
I've got a personnel review

09:52.483 --> 09:54.610
scheduled to start
in about five minutes

09:54.652 --> 09:56.745
and I know it's been
a long day for you.

09:56.788 --> 09:58.688
So, why don't we get
together later?

09:58.723 --> 10:01.487
Sort of plan out our agenda
for the next day or two.

10:01.526 --> 10:02.686
Agenda?

10:02.727 --> 10:04.524
What it is we want
to accomplish here.

10:04.562 --> 10:06.689
How we might best
go about that.

10:06.731 --> 10:09.825
Maybe even get to know
each other a little bit.

10:09.868 --> 10:13.099
It might make this easier.

10:13.137 --> 10:14.934
Maybe you're right.

10:14.973 --> 10:16.167
Okay, great.

10:16.274 --> 10:19.971
How about, uh... my quarters?

10:20.011 --> 10:22.411
1900 hours?

10:22.447 --> 10:24.347
Maybe even have a bite to eat?

10:24.382 --> 10:26.612
I make a great fungilli.

10:26.651 --> 10:29.381
I love fungilli.

10:29.420 --> 10:31.684
Is that right?

10:31.723 --> 10:33.247
Huh.

10:47.188 --> 10:50.988
Sensors are having difficulty
penetrating the interior.

10:51.025 --> 10:53.994
However, the radiated output
suggests a coherent system

10:54.028 --> 10:56.792
of energy storage
and utilization.

10:56.831 --> 10:59.493
Then it was constructed
by someone?

10:59.533 --> 11:00.795
It is a possibility.

11:00.835 --> 11:02.962
However, the sensor data
gathered thus far

11:03.003 --> 11:04.971
suggests a naturally
occurring phenomenon

11:05.005 --> 11:06.734
with biological properties.

11:06.774 --> 11:08.139
A life-form?

11:08.175 --> 11:09.608
Yes, Captain.

11:11.145 --> 11:14.706
Mr. Worf, begin compiling
readings for transmission

11:14.748 --> 11:16.238
to Starfleet Headquarters.

11:16.283 --> 11:19.309
Mr. Data, prepare to launch
three level-5 probes.

11:19.353 --> 11:21.082
Ensign, aft thrusters.

11:21.122 --> 11:23.590
Standard observational posture.

11:23.624 --> 11:27.151
Level-5 probe sequence
ready for launch, Commander.

11:27.194 --> 11:28.161
On your mark.

11:28.262 --> 11:29.889
Stand by, Mr. Data.

11:29.930 --> 11:30.919
Aye, sir.

11:33.868 --> 11:35.961
What would it be like,
Counselor?

11:36.003 --> 11:39.564
No ship, no bulky space suits.

11:39.607 --> 11:42.041
Just to live between the stars

11:42.076 --> 11:44.374
and have the entire galaxy
as a home.

11:49.049 --> 11:51.677
Captain, we are being probed.

11:51.719 --> 11:53.846
Recommend we raise shields.

11:53.888 --> 11:55.753
Negative, Mr. Worf.

11:55.789 --> 11:58.622
We are curious about it.

11:58.659 --> 12:01.628
It has a perfect right
to be curious about us.

12:03.497 --> 12:05.488
Change in readings, sir.

12:08.569 --> 12:10.127
It is moving toward us.

12:10.237 --> 12:12.102
Reverse course, Ensign.

12:12.139 --> 12:13.800
300 kph.

12:13.841 --> 12:15.001
Aye, sir.

12:15.042 --> 12:16.407
Now, easy.

12:16.443 --> 12:18.843
We don't want to alarm
or provoke it.

12:31.625 --> 12:34.150
We are caught
in an energy damping field, sir.

12:34.195 --> 12:35.924
Raise shields.

12:37.565 --> 12:39.032
No effect, Captain.

12:39.066 --> 12:42.467
Reverse power, full impulse.

12:42.503 --> 12:44.562
Impulse engines at full power.

12:44.605 --> 12:47.403
No change in position, sir.

12:47.441 --> 12:48.772
Red Alert!

12:51.011 --> 12:54.276
Mr. La Forge,
prepare to initiate warp drive.

12:54.315 --> 12:55.441
Sorry, Captain.

12:55.482 --> 12:58.007
There's too much interference
to form a warp field.

12:58.052 --> 12:59.110
Warning.

12:59.153 --> 13:02.714
Radiation levels
at 65 millirads per minute

13:02.756 --> 13:03.723
and rising.

13:03.757 --> 13:05.122
Riker to Dr. Crusher.

13:05.159 --> 13:06.456
Go ahead, Commander.

13:06.493 --> 13:08.723
All decks prepare
for radiation protocol.

13:08.762 --> 13:09.956
Acknowledged. Crusher out.

13:09.997 --> 13:11.055
Warning.

13:11.098 --> 13:13.965
Radiation levels at 300
millirads per minute and rising.

13:14.001 --> 13:16.026
Lethal exposure in one minute.

13:16.070 --> 13:18.129
Mr. Worf, ready phasers.

13:18.205 --> 13:20.435
Minimum power.

13:20.474 --> 13:21.873
Ready.

13:24.578 --> 13:25.806
Fire.

13:32.353 --> 13:35.322
Radiation levels dropping back
to normal, Captain.

13:35.356 --> 13:38.814
Energy patterns are
breaking down, sir.

13:40.361 --> 13:44.695
The radiation signature
is no longer stable.

13:46.367 --> 13:48.198
Energy output is negligible,
sir.

13:50.571 --> 13:52.539
Radiation patterns...

13:52.573 --> 13:54.541
no longer coherent.

13:57.544 --> 13:59.512
I believe it is dead, sir.

14:16.330 --> 14:19.128
We're out here to explore

14:19.233 --> 14:21.963
to make contact
with other life-forms

14:22.002 --> 14:27.133
to establish peaceful relations,
but not to interfere...

14:27.174 --> 14:30.166
and absolutely not to destroy.

14:33.847 --> 14:38.147
And yet, look
at what we have just done.

14:38.252 --> 14:40.311
Captain, everything you did

14:40.354 --> 14:43.812
was consistent with established
Starfleet procedures.

14:46.460 --> 14:48.394
Number One, you have the Bridge.

14:51.532 --> 14:54.262
Captain, sensors are picking up

14:54.301 --> 14:57.862
a new energy reading
from the life-form.

14:57.905 --> 15:00.100
Elaborate, Data.

15:00.140 --> 15:03.598
There is a new concentration
of ionizing radiation

15:03.644 --> 15:07.444
growing in the center
of its body.

15:07.481 --> 15:08.971
Then...

15:13.487 --> 15:15.648
perhaps it's still alive.

15:18.992 --> 15:20.323
Okay.

15:21.495 --> 15:25.363
Computer, subdued lighting.

15:25.399 --> 15:27.458
No, that's... that's too much.

15:27.501 --> 15:29.628
l-I don't want it dark.

15:29.670 --> 15:31.797
I want it cozy.

15:31.839 --> 15:35.798
Please state your request
in precise candlepower.

15:35.843 --> 15:38.311
See, it's not a matter
of precision, computer.

15:38.345 --> 15:40.336
It's a matter of mood.

15:40.381 --> 15:43.373
Brighter than this.

15:43.417 --> 15:47.148
Hmm. More.

15:47.187 --> 15:50.315
More...

15:50.357 --> 15:52.985
A little more.

15:53.026 --> 15:54.789
Hold! Right there.

15:54.828 --> 15:56.159
Perfect.

15:56.196 --> 15:59.256
Now, some, um, some music.

15:59.299 --> 16:01.392
Maybe, uh...

16:01.435 --> 16:04.632
maybe a little soft jazz.

16:06.140 --> 16:08.108
Mm. No, that's...
that's not right.

16:08.142 --> 16:09.769
Let me think here.

16:09.810 --> 16:11.778
Oh, I got it.

16:11.812 --> 16:14.337
Uh, some Brahms.

16:14.381 --> 16:16.474
A piano etude.

16:18.986 --> 16:23.787
Mm... no, that's, uh...
that's too corny.

16:23.824 --> 16:24.791
Hmm.

16:24.825 --> 16:27.293
Probably everybody
thinks of that.

16:27.327 --> 16:29.625
Computer, just give me
some guitar.

16:29.663 --> 16:30.960
Classical guitar.

16:30.998 --> 16:32.659
Doesn't matter who.

16:34.334 --> 16:36.495
Yes. Thank you.

16:43.844 --> 16:46.335
Come on in.

16:46.380 --> 16:50.817
Oh, uh... you've changed.

16:50.851 --> 16:52.648
Yeah.

16:52.686 --> 16:56.144
Uniforms are so... formal.

16:56.256 --> 17:00.090
You're less formal than
any Starfleet officer

17:00.127 --> 17:02.254
I've ever met, Commander.

17:02.296 --> 17:03.923
Am I?

17:03.964 --> 17:07.422
I really just wanted to make you
feel more comfortable.

17:07.468 --> 17:09.459
I'm fine, thank you.

17:10.971 --> 17:12.438
I'm sorry.

17:12.473 --> 17:15.964
Come in and, uh, have a seat.

17:17.978 --> 17:19.605
Uh, can I get you a drink?

17:19.646 --> 17:20.771
No, thank you.

17:20.814 --> 17:21.781
You sure?

17:21.815 --> 17:23.442
Mm-hmm.

17:23.483 --> 17:25.452
You know...

17:25.486 --> 17:29.445
your hair... it's, uh...

17:29.490 --> 17:31.788
it's different.

17:31.825 --> 17:34.726
Different than a few hours ago?

17:34.761 --> 17:37.958
No, I mean it's different
than I expected.

17:37.998 --> 17:40.558
Different from
your Starfleet records.

17:40.601 --> 17:44.128
Oh, yes, I used to wear it up.

17:44.171 --> 17:45.138
Yeah.

17:45.239 --> 17:47.605
Why would you need to see
my personnel files?

17:49.510 --> 17:52.308
Standard procedure
when guests come on board...

17:52.346 --> 17:53.404
protocol.

17:53.447 --> 17:55.745
I mean, it was nothing specific
actually.

17:55.782 --> 17:58.080
Just, you know...

17:58.118 --> 18:00.985
Commander La Forge...

18:01.021 --> 18:06.425
if I seem to be somewhat
unyielding in my views

18:06.460 --> 18:10.863
it's because I care so very much
about my work.

18:10.898 --> 18:13.628
Oh, l-I know.

18:13.667 --> 18:18.229
To be honest,
people find me... cold

18:18.272 --> 18:22.800
cerebral, lacking in humor...

18:22.843 --> 18:24.777
But they're wrong.

18:24.811 --> 18:26.210
I assure you.

18:27.748 --> 18:30.546
Well, I try not to be that way

18:30.584 --> 18:36.079
but when it comes to my designs,
my engines, especially the ones

18:36.212 --> 18:37.304
on the Enterprise... 

18:37.347 --> 18:40.441
It's like...

18:40.483 --> 18:42.246
they're your children.

18:42.285 --> 18:46.085
Yes. Exactly.

18:46.122 --> 18:49.649
So, naturally, you're
a little possessive about them.

18:49.692 --> 18:53.788
You understand that?

18:53.830 --> 18:55.058
Yes, I do.

18:55.098 --> 18:59.125
You see...
I feel the same way.

18:59.235 --> 19:01.726
That's amazing.

19:01.771 --> 19:04.865
I don't think anyone has ever...

19:07.277 --> 19:09.711
Sometimes I feel
more comfortable

19:09.746 --> 19:12.340
with engine schematics
than people.

19:12.382 --> 19:17.877
Well, maybe you just haven't
met the right... people.

19:21.758 --> 19:23.350
You hungry?

19:23.393 --> 19:24.917
I'm hungry.

19:24.961 --> 19:26.895
Why don't
I just start dinner, okay?

19:26.930 --> 19:28.864
Commander...

19:28.898 --> 19:31.366
Please, call me Geordi.

19:31.401 --> 19:32.766
I'm sorry.

19:32.802 --> 19:35.930
I hope that I didn't put you
to a lot of trouble

19:35.972 --> 19:37.303
but I can't stay.

19:37.340 --> 19:38.932
You can't?

19:38.975 --> 19:42.103
I just don't think
that it's appropriate.

19:42.145 --> 19:45.012
Oh, uh-huh.

19:45.048 --> 19:48.017
I'll meet with you
at 0800 tomorrow?

19:48.051 --> 19:50.519
I'm preparing
a list of discrepancies

19:50.553 --> 19:53.454
that I've identified
in your modifications.

19:53.489 --> 19:54.922
I hope...

19:54.958 --> 19:57.119
now that we've reached
an understanding...

19:57.160 --> 20:00.527
that you'll be prepared
to discuss them with me

20:00.563 --> 20:02.121
in a more objective fashion.

20:03.499 --> 20:05.626
Sure. Fine.

20:05.668 --> 20:06.965
Thank you.

20:07.003 --> 20:08.527
Good night, Commander.

20:14.177 --> 20:15.667
Good night.

20:17.680 --> 20:20.376
This new concentration
of energy was detected

20:20.416 --> 20:23.385
only after the surrounding
material became inert.

20:23.419 --> 20:26.149
Could this be some sort
of tissue regeneration?

20:26.256 --> 20:29.157
The radiation signature is
similar to the original pattern

20:29.192 --> 20:30.887
but with significant
differences.

20:30.927 --> 20:34.522
Some kind of reaction
to our phaser fire, perhaps?

20:34.564 --> 20:36.429
I believe it is separate
and self-contained

20:36.466 --> 20:38.127
within the body
of the dead life-form.

20:38.167 --> 20:39.498
Another entity.

20:39.535 --> 20:40.900
Yes, sir.

20:40.937 --> 20:42.632
It appears to be

20:42.672 --> 20:44.572
a smaller,
less-developed version

20:44.607 --> 20:46.404
of the original creature.

20:46.442 --> 20:47.409
Huh.

20:47.443 --> 20:50.105
No wonder it attacked us.

20:50.146 --> 20:53.707
It was about to give birth.

21:05.862 --> 21:07.295
Doctor.

21:07.330 --> 21:10.595
It's dangerous to generalize
about new life-forms

21:10.633 --> 21:12.863
but based on my experience
with other beings

21:12.902 --> 21:14.665
who bear their young
in this manner

21:14.704 --> 21:18.299
I'd say that the offspring
is still premature.

21:18.341 --> 21:20.434
Otherwise, it would be able
to break through

21:20.476 --> 21:22.137
the outer body shell
of the parent.

21:22.245 --> 21:23.507
Will this creature

21:23.546 --> 21:26.640
be able to survive on its own
without the parent?

21:26.683 --> 21:28.617
There's no way to tell.

21:28.651 --> 21:31.313
We don't have enough information
about the biofunctions

21:31.354 --> 21:33.948
of the adult,
much less the child.

21:33.990 --> 21:36.049
Is there anything
we can do to help?

21:36.092 --> 21:40.392
If we were in Sick Bay,
I'd try a cesarean section.

21:40.430 --> 21:41.954
The first priority

21:41.998 --> 21:44.330
is to free it
from the body of the parent.

21:44.367 --> 21:46.528
We could use our phasers
as a scalpel.

21:46.569 --> 21:48.366
Yes, that might work.

21:48.404 --> 21:50.167
I advise against this, Captain.

21:50.239 --> 21:52.969
The parent proved to be
a threat to the ship.

21:53.009 --> 21:56.501
We do not know
how the offspring will react.

21:56.546 --> 21:59.140
Your objection is noted,
Mr. Worf

21:59.182 --> 22:03.642
but we are directly responsible
for the death of the parent.

22:03.686 --> 22:07.122
We cannot simply wash our hands
of it now.

22:07.190 --> 22:09.181
Doctor, we will proceed
at your discretion.

22:15.698 --> 22:16.995
Good morning.

22:17.033 --> 22:18.330
Good morning.

22:18.368 --> 22:19.665
The first thing I'd like to do

22:19.702 --> 22:21.431
is inspect the power
transfer conduits.

22:21.471 --> 22:24.929
You realize the only way to
inspect them is to crawl inside.

22:24.974 --> 22:27.340
I designed them, Commander.

22:27.377 --> 22:29.538
I know what's involved.

22:36.386 --> 22:38.513
Here we go.

22:38.554 --> 22:40.715
Power taps... watch yourself.

22:43.559 --> 22:47.051
The acoustic signature
doesn't sound right.

22:47.096 --> 22:49.360
You're probably the only
other person in the galaxy

22:49.399 --> 22:50.957
who could pick that up.

22:51.000 --> 22:52.661
What's causing it?

22:52.702 --> 22:54.932
It's right up here.

22:54.971 --> 22:58.805
I've never seen anything
like this before.

22:58.841 --> 23:00.103
What is it?

23:00.143 --> 23:03.374
It's a mid-range phase adjuster.

23:03.413 --> 23:07.076
Puts the plasma back into phase
after inertial distortion.

23:07.116 --> 23:09.676
This has never been done before.

23:09.719 --> 23:10.708
I don't even think

23:10.753 --> 23:13.278
this has ever even been
conceived of before.

23:13.322 --> 23:15.688
You should write
a scientific paper.

23:17.026 --> 23:18.254
Uh-uh, Doctor, no.

23:18.294 --> 23:21.491
Writing is not
one of my strong suits.

23:21.531 --> 23:25.627
But this kind of refinement
should be shared

23:25.668 --> 23:27.659
and you deserve
the credit for it.

23:27.703 --> 23:31.332
Well, maybe we could, uh...
collaborate.

23:31.374 --> 23:34.343
Writing is one
of your strong points.

23:40.950 --> 23:42.645
Commander La Forge...

23:42.685 --> 23:45.483
ever since I came on board

23:45.521 --> 23:49.355
there seems to be something
a little peculiar

23:49.392 --> 23:52.122
about your attitude.

23:52.161 --> 23:55.130
You seem to know
things about me...

23:55.164 --> 23:57.655
even though we've never met.

24:01.170 --> 24:02.467
Well, uh...

24:04.507 --> 24:07.442
to tell you, uh,
to tell you the truth

24:08.444 --> 24:10.036
I've studied you.

24:10.079 --> 24:14.812
Your writings,
your Starfleet file.

24:14.851 --> 24:16.682
I've admired you.

24:16.719 --> 24:18.778
You know, your... your work.

24:18.821 --> 24:21.312
Well, I'm flattered, but...

24:21.357 --> 24:23.052
And...

24:25.495 --> 24:26.655
Ah...

24:26.696 --> 24:28.664
Well, I really...

24:28.698 --> 24:31.826
I really wanted to meet you
for a long time

24:31.868 --> 24:35.360
and... I'd like to think

24:35.404 --> 24:40.034
that... we could become friends.

24:40.076 --> 24:43.136
Maybe good friends.

24:43.179 --> 24:45.374
I thought you knew.

24:48.718 --> 24:51.778
I mean, you know
everything else about me.

24:51.821 --> 24:55.518
But, Commander, um...

24:55.558 --> 24:59.358
if I'm hearing
what I think I'm hearing

24:59.395 --> 25:02.523
then you should know

25:02.565 --> 25:05.363
that I'm married.

25:14.844 --> 25:18.302
Set phaser power
to three percent, narrow beam.

25:18.347 --> 25:19.974
Three percent.

25:20.016 --> 25:21.142
All right.

25:22.184 --> 25:24.243
Here we go.

25:29.792 --> 25:32.124
The first incision is complete.

25:32.228 --> 25:34.128
Ideally, the offspring
should now be able

25:34.163 --> 25:36.893
to push through the outer shell
of the parent by itself.

25:39.936 --> 25:42.302
I think it needs
a little more help.

25:42.338 --> 25:44.329
We've done all we can.

25:44.373 --> 25:48.742
I don't want to risk hitting
the offspring by accident.

25:52.281 --> 25:53.771
Come on.

25:53.816 --> 25:55.943
You can do it.

26:04.694 --> 26:06.855
Ah! Captain

26:06.896 --> 26:11.924
I'd like to announce the birth
of a large baby... something.

26:13.436 --> 26:15.233
Well done, Doctor.

26:17.306 --> 26:18.466
Well done.

26:21.280 --> 26:23.077
How could it have been
so far off?

26:23.182 --> 26:25.582
It was based on every
piece of information

26:25.618 --> 26:27.279
on record about Leah Brahms...

26:27.319 --> 26:30.345
okay, with an admitted
margin for error

26:30.389 --> 26:35.190
but this is an error that's
about a light-year wide.

26:35.227 --> 26:36.922
Not what you hoped for, huh?

26:36.962 --> 26:39.021
Hoped... Guinan

26:39.064 --> 26:43.524
the woman is about as friendly
as a Circassian Plague Cat.

26:43.569 --> 26:46.094
Only cares about her work

26:46.138 --> 26:49.767
hates what I've done
to her engines

26:49.808 --> 26:53.801
and, to top it all off,
she's married.

26:53.846 --> 26:57.304
The computer never even told me
she was married.

26:57.349 --> 26:58.816
Computer glitch?

26:58.851 --> 27:00.978
Must have been.

27:01.020 --> 27:04.183
Maybe it was your old VISOR.

27:04.223 --> 27:06.589
What are you talking about?

27:06.625 --> 27:09.617
Well, the one you wore when you
were on the holodeck with her.

27:09.662 --> 27:14.599
Guinan, it's the same VISOR.

27:14.633 --> 27:17.033
Really?

27:17.069 --> 27:19.060
Oh, I figured it was
probably the one

27:19.104 --> 27:21.265
that lets you see
what you want to see.

27:22.841 --> 27:24.832
What's that supposed to mean?

27:24.877 --> 27:29.177
You saw exactly what you wanted
to see on the holodeck.

27:29.214 --> 27:31.842
Sure, the computer made it
look like her

27:31.884 --> 27:33.749
gave it personality

27:33.786 --> 27:36.414
but when it came
to the relationship, La Forge

27:36.455 --> 27:38.082
you... filled in the blanks.

27:38.123 --> 27:40.921
And you had
a perfectly wonderful

27:40.960 --> 27:43.087
marvelous little fantasy

27:43.128 --> 27:46.723
until the real Leah showed up
and ruined it.

27:46.765 --> 27:49.859
Now, she's probably done
the most horrific thing

27:49.902 --> 27:51.927
one person can do to another...

27:51.971 --> 27:55.065
not live up
to your expectations.

27:55.107 --> 28:00.739
So I'd take a good, long,
hard look at her, La Forge.

28:00.779 --> 28:06.012
See her for who she is,
not for what you want her to be.

28:11.557 --> 28:14.526
The life-form's patterns
are stable, Captain.

28:14.560 --> 28:17.529
It seems able to withstand
the solar radiation.

28:17.563 --> 28:19.554
Good. Ensign, set a course
for the Guernica system.

28:19.598 --> 28:20.565
Aye, sir.

28:20.599 --> 28:21.691
We're not staying?

28:21.734 --> 28:22.826
No, Number One.

28:22.868 --> 28:24.028
We've done all we can to help.

28:24.069 --> 28:25.058
Now it's time to move on.

28:25.104 --> 28:27.595
This creature can
continue its existence

28:27.639 --> 28:30.472
without any further
interference from us.

28:30.509 --> 28:32.739
It might be wise to put
some distance between us

28:32.778 --> 28:34.177
before we initiate warp drive.

28:34.213 --> 28:38.081
Very well. 500 kph, Ensign.

28:38.150 --> 28:39.879
Engage.

28:47.926 --> 28:50.622
Captain, it is following us.

28:50.662 --> 28:53.722
Maintaining a distance
of... four kilometers.

28:53.766 --> 28:54.994
Directly astern.

28:55.034 --> 28:57.264
17 degrees to port, Ensign.

28:57.302 --> 28:58.394
Aye, sir.

28:58.437 --> 29:00.428
It is turning with us, sir.

29:00.472 --> 29:02.736
Increase to half impulse.

29:04.843 --> 29:06.868
It is matching our velocity.

29:06.912 --> 29:10.507
It's imprinted on us.

29:10.549 --> 29:13.177
It thinks the Enterprise
is its mother.

29:15.788 --> 29:17.255
Change in energy reading, sir.

29:17.289 --> 29:19.985
I am reading an internal buildup
of gamma particles...

29:20.025 --> 29:21.515
Its velocity is increasing.

29:21.560 --> 29:23.528
It is moving directly
toward the ship.

29:23.562 --> 29:25.427
Evasive maneuvers. Full...

29:26.965 --> 29:28.262
Report.

29:28.300 --> 29:30.393
Minor damage.

29:30.436 --> 29:33.303
The creature is now in direct
contact with the hull, sir.

29:33.338 --> 29:34.965
On screen.

29:42.815 --> 29:44.248
Mr. Data?

29:44.283 --> 29:46.217
Sir, the life-form
is draining energy

29:46.251 --> 29:48.082
directly
from the fusion reactors.

29:48.120 --> 29:51.089
It's feeding off the
energy of the Enterprise

29:51.156 --> 29:52.987
as it would from its mother.

29:53.025 --> 29:55.789
What action should we take, sir?

29:57.796 --> 29:59.058
None, Lieutenant.

30:04.636 --> 30:06.604
None at all.

30:13.812 --> 30:16.280
Captain's Log, supplemental.

30:16.315 --> 30:19.079
Since the newborn
has attached itself to the hull

30:19.118 --> 30:21.484
it has been making
greater and greater demands

30:21.520 --> 30:23.784
on the ship's energy,
but we have been able

30:23.822 --> 30:26.052
to stabilize
our power systems temporarily.

30:26.091 --> 30:29.083
How long before the power drain
becomes critical, Mr. La Forge?

30:29.128 --> 30:30.652
If it continues to increase
at the same rate

30:30.696 --> 30:32.357
six, maybe seven hours.

30:32.397 --> 30:33.659
We may be able
to modify the engine

30:33.699 --> 30:35.132
to extend that
a little longer, Captain.

30:35.234 --> 30:36.895
Your help would be
appreciated, Doctor.

30:36.935 --> 30:39.028
By then, Junior may
not need us anymore.

30:39.071 --> 30:41.904
Mr. Data, is there any way
to determine

30:41.940 --> 30:44.408
what the destination
of the parent

30:44.443 --> 30:45.410
might have been?

30:45.444 --> 30:46.706
I can attempt to extrapolate

30:46.745 --> 30:49.339
from the heading it was on
when we encountered it, sir.

30:49.381 --> 30:50.678
Perhaps it was on its way

30:50.716 --> 30:53.879
to provide a safe and supportive
environment for its newborn.

30:53.919 --> 30:56.854
We might be able to deliver it
to the same destination.

30:56.889 --> 30:58.117
Which brings up the question

30:58.157 --> 31:00.318
of how do we get Junior off
the hull once we get there.

31:00.359 --> 31:04.090
It's almost completely covering
the door of Shuttle Bay Two.

31:04.129 --> 31:05.096
If we open the door

31:05.164 --> 31:07.564
and deactivate the atmospheric
force field...

31:07.599 --> 31:09.260
The pressure
from inside the ship

31:09.301 --> 31:10.962
might push it
away from the hull.

31:11.003 --> 31:13.699
Make it so.

31:13.739 --> 31:14.706
Sir?

31:14.740 --> 31:16.799
Is the appellation "Junior"

31:16.842 --> 31:19.572
to be the life-form's
official name?

31:19.611 --> 31:21.101
No, it is not.

31:25.017 --> 31:26.484
We can save a lot of energy

31:26.518 --> 31:28.509
just by improving
engine efficiency.

31:28.554 --> 31:30.112
We've run
into similar problems before.

31:30.222 --> 31:32.588
That's actually why I reoriented
the dilithium crystal.

31:32.624 --> 31:34.854
And why you added
the mid-range phase adjusters.

31:34.893 --> 31:35.917
Right.

31:35.961 --> 31:37.451
Commander, it seems
that you've made

31:37.496 --> 31:39.293
a lot more modifications
than I'm aware of.

31:39.331 --> 31:41.322
Do you have a file on
all the work you've done?

31:41.366 --> 31:42.560
Mm-hmm.
It's in the computer.

31:42.601 --> 31:43.568
Good.

31:43.602 --> 31:44.864
Picard to La Forge.

31:44.903 --> 31:45.927
La Forge here.

31:45.971 --> 31:48.132
Commander, I need to see you
on the Bridge.

31:48.173 --> 31:49.800
On my way, Captain.

31:49.841 --> 31:51.035
You go on ahead, Doctor.

31:51.076 --> 31:52.509
Ensign Pavlick
can show you the file

31:52.544 --> 31:53.670
on the engine modifications.

31:59.551 --> 32:03.351
"Phase coils upgraded
to 55 field densities.

32:03.388 --> 32:07.848
Plasma inducers interlinked
with generator."

32:07.893 --> 32:08.860
Ensign?

32:08.894 --> 32:10.794
Would there be any other files

32:10.829 --> 32:13.923
with data on the original
engine specifications?

32:13.966 --> 32:15.399
I believe so, Doctor.

32:19.671 --> 32:23.107
This file utilizes
the prototype engine schematic.

32:23.175 --> 32:25.109
It's a holographic program

32:25.143 --> 32:28.442
set in the drafting room
at Utopia Planitia.

32:28.480 --> 32:31.574
I'll run it on Holodeck Three.

32:39.424 --> 32:42.052
Computer, replay program 9140

32:42.094 --> 32:45.325
engine schematic
at Utopia Planitia.

32:45.364 --> 32:48.527
Program loaded and ready.

32:53.572 --> 32:55.301
She went where?

32:55.340 --> 32:56.466
Holodeck Three, sir.

32:56.508 --> 32:57.702
I didn't think

32:57.743 --> 32:59.643
there was anything wrong
with her seeing the file.

32:59.678 --> 33:00.872
No, of course not.

33:00.912 --> 33:02.777
Nothing at all!

33:02.814 --> 33:06.045
I'm with you every day, Geordi.

33:06.084 --> 33:07.949
Every time you look
at this engine

33:07.986 --> 33:09.180
you're looking at me.

33:09.221 --> 33:11.781
Every time you touch it,
it's me.

33:16.561 --> 33:17.994
Computer, freeze program.

33:19.364 --> 33:22.697
Now... I understand.

33:22.734 --> 33:24.429
No, you don't.

33:24.469 --> 33:26.266
It's not the way this may look.

33:26.305 --> 33:29.638
I called up a replay
of the program file.

33:29.675 --> 33:32.235
I was all ready to compliment
you again, Commander

33:32.277 --> 33:34.336
for constructing a program

33:34.379 --> 33:36.506
which contained
the prototype engine.

33:36.548 --> 33:38.243
So that you would always have

33:38.283 --> 33:40.877
a baseline reference
for your modifications.

33:40.919 --> 33:46.118
And now I find
that it's all about...

33:46.224 --> 33:47.213
a fantasy plaything.

33:47.259 --> 33:48.226
It's not like that.

33:48.260 --> 33:49.227
I swear...

33:49.261 --> 33:51.752
I'm outraged by this!

33:51.797 --> 33:54.095
I have been invaded, violated!

33:54.132 --> 33:56.464
How dare you use me like this?

33:56.501 --> 33:58.332
How far did it go anyway?

33:58.370 --> 33:59.769
Was it good for you?

33:59.805 --> 34:01.329
Nothing like that happened.

34:01.373 --> 34:03.398
It was a professional
collaboration.

34:03.442 --> 34:04.568
Oh, I can tell.

34:04.609 --> 34:06.076
"Every time you're touching
the engine

34:06.111 --> 34:07.078
you're touching me"?

34:07.112 --> 34:08.079
Real professional!

34:08.112 --> 34:09.670
Look, if you watched
the whole program

34:09.715 --> 34:10.875
you saw what it was.

34:10.916 --> 34:12.382
We were working together

34:12.417 --> 34:14.851
to solve a problem
in a crisis situation.

34:14.886 --> 34:16.717
How do I know how far it went?

34:16.755 --> 34:19.087
How many other programs
did you create?

34:19.157 --> 34:22.489
Perhaps dozens of them,
one for every day of the week.

34:22.527 --> 34:23.551
One for every mood!

34:23.594 --> 34:25.790
All right, look.

34:25.831 --> 34:28.732
Ever since you came on board,
you've been badgering me.

34:28.766 --> 34:29.734
And I've taken it.

34:29.768 --> 34:31.632
I've shown you courtesy

34:31.670 --> 34:34.434
and respect, and a hell
of a lot of patience.

34:34.473 --> 34:36.065
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Wait a minute.

34:36.108 --> 34:39.373
I've tried to understand you.

34:39.411 --> 34:41.106
I've tried
to get along with you.

34:41.179 --> 34:43.943
And in return you've accused,
tried and convicted me

34:43.982 --> 34:46.416
without even bothering
to hear my side of it?

34:46.451 --> 34:48.942
So, I'm guilty, okay?

34:48.987 --> 34:51.978
But not of what you think.

34:52.023 --> 34:54.422
Of something much worse.

34:54.458 --> 34:58.919
I'm guilty
of reaching out to you

34:58.964 --> 35:03.060
of hoping we could connect.

35:03.168 --> 35:08.731
I'm guilty
of a terrible crime, Doctor.

35:10.409 --> 35:12.707
I offered you friendship.

35:28.754 --> 35:30.221
in the last three hours.

35:30.256 --> 35:32.520
I now read it
at 46 million cubic meters.

35:32.558 --> 35:34.788
Captain, I have completed
the analysis

35:34.827 --> 35:37.022
of the parent's course
through the system.

35:37.063 --> 35:38.928
It was headed
for an asteroid belt.

35:40.132 --> 35:43.226
Ensign Rager,
set a course 259 mark 318.

35:43.269 --> 35:44.258
Half impulse.

35:44.303 --> 35:45.361
Aye, sir.

35:45.404 --> 35:48.601
Hold a position 500 kilometers
from the periphery

35:48.641 --> 35:50.108
of the asteroid field.

35:50.176 --> 35:51.165
Aye, sir.

35:58.250 --> 36:01.219
Difficulty getting
a clear sensor reading

36:01.253 --> 36:03.016
beyond 4,000 kilometers.

36:03.055 --> 36:06.218
The asteroids contain
large quantities of meklinite

36:06.258 --> 36:08.658
which is interfering
with our scanners.

36:08.694 --> 36:11.993
I am also detecting
traces of Kefnium

36:12.031 --> 36:15.489
a compound found in the outer
shell of the parent being.

36:15.534 --> 36:17.161
It is likely the asteroids

36:17.203 --> 36:20.001
provide sustenance
for this life-form, sir.

36:20.039 --> 36:21.336
We could leave the child here.

36:21.373 --> 36:23.739
If Data's right, it would have
an ample supply of food.

36:23.776 --> 36:24.743
Agreed.

36:24.777 --> 36:26.540
Mr. La Forge, are you ready

36:26.579 --> 36:28.877
to separate our guest
from the hull?

36:28.914 --> 36:29.881
Ready, Captain.

36:29.915 --> 36:30.904
Proceed.

36:41.660 --> 36:45.892
I am deactivating
the atmospheric force field now.

36:56.108 --> 36:57.268
Engineering, report.

37:00.146 --> 37:02.341
Captain,
the offspring is emitting

37:02.381 --> 37:03.905
high-frequency
radio transmissions.

37:03.949 --> 37:05.246
Is it trying to communicate?

37:05.284 --> 37:07.047
The power drain is increasing.

37:07.119 --> 37:09.280
Approaching auto-shutdown.

37:09.321 --> 37:10.720
Take the engines off-line.

37:10.756 --> 37:12.747
Supplement
with auxiliary power only.

37:12.791 --> 37:14.816
All decks go
to emergency level seven.

37:14.860 --> 37:17.055
Life-support
and critical operations only.

37:17.163 --> 37:18.994
Mr. La Forge,
what is your status?

37:19.031 --> 37:20.055
Sorry, Captain.

37:20.099 --> 37:22.966
The bay has been
completely depressurized

37:23.002 --> 37:25.061
but... it's still hanging on.

37:25.137 --> 37:27.970
I am detecting other radio
transmissions, Captain.

37:28.007 --> 37:32.000
Sensors detect movement
within the asteroid field.

37:32.044 --> 37:34.672
Bearing 257 mark 161.

37:34.713 --> 37:36.806
On screen.

37:37.883 --> 37:39.009
Magnify.

37:41.453 --> 37:43.751
At their current speed, sir

37:43.789 --> 37:48.726
the entities will intercept us
in... ten minutes, 31 seconds.

37:48.761 --> 37:50.058
Weapon status?

37:50.095 --> 37:51.460
Auxiliary power only.

37:51.497 --> 37:53.692
Two seconds'
phaser fire available.

38:16.422 --> 38:18.890
Ensign, power readings.

38:18.924 --> 38:20.892
We're on auxiliary generators.

38:20.926 --> 38:22.860
Life-support is functioning.

38:22.895 --> 38:23.953
That's about all.

38:23.996 --> 38:25.588
Keep your eye on that
generator console.

38:25.631 --> 38:28.327
We've got less than six minutes
to get that baby off our back

38:28.367 --> 38:29.698
before his relatives get here.

38:29.735 --> 38:33.671
Whatever we try, Junior responds
by sucking up more energy.

38:34.607 --> 38:35.733
Commander

38:35.774 --> 38:37.071
I have a thought...

38:37.176 --> 38:39.770
if you're interested.

38:39.812 --> 38:40.801
Of course.

38:40.846 --> 38:42.074
What is it?

38:42.147 --> 38:45.480
If the baby is nursing,
perhaps what we need

38:45.517 --> 38:48.077
is to find a way
to sour the milk.

38:48.153 --> 38:51.714
If we could contaminate
the energy he's feeding on

38:51.757 --> 38:53.088
we could try to...

38:53.125 --> 38:54.786
Make it unpalatable somehow.

38:54.827 --> 38:55.953
Uh-huh.

38:55.995 --> 38:59.021
But the emergency generators
are all we've got.

38:59.064 --> 39:02.295
And how do we modify them
without losing life-support?

39:02.334 --> 39:03.733
Exactly.

39:07.406 --> 39:08.737
Unless...

39:10.976 --> 39:12.034
What?

39:12.077 --> 39:13.169
Well...

39:13.212 --> 39:15.373
this is a space baby, right?

39:15.414 --> 39:18.008
I mean these creatures are born

39:18.050 --> 39:21.247
they live and die
in interstellar space.

39:21.287 --> 39:22.379
Apparently.

39:22.421 --> 39:24.048
Okay.

39:24.123 --> 39:28.423
All matter in space vibrates
in a specific radiation band.

39:28.460 --> 39:31.588
21 centimeters.

39:31.630 --> 39:33.689
Oh...

39:33.732 --> 39:36.599
Oh, that's good, Commander.

39:36.635 --> 39:38.296
That's very good.

39:38.337 --> 39:40.237
If we could alter
the power frequency

39:40.272 --> 39:41.899
so that it's completely foreign

39:41.940 --> 39:44.033
to the life-form's
natural vibrations...

39:44.076 --> 39:45.475
Might just give us enough

39:45.511 --> 39:47.775
to pour a little vinegar
in baby's milk.

39:47.813 --> 39:49.474
Yeah, we have to be careful
though.

39:49.515 --> 39:52.484
If we upset it this time, we
might lose auxiliary power, too.

39:52.518 --> 39:55.385
If we're gradual enough,
it won't be such a shock.

39:55.421 --> 39:57.514
Hopefully, it'll just
lose interest.

39:59.458 --> 40:01.221
La Forge to Bridge.

40:01.260 --> 40:02.727
Go ahead.

40:02.761 --> 40:06.253
Captain, Dr. Brahms and I
have a plan.

40:19.812 --> 40:22.940
Two minutes until the creatures
intercept, Captain.

40:31.390 --> 40:34.882
Captain, we're ready down here.

40:34.927 --> 40:36.451
Proceed.

40:36.495 --> 40:39.521
Lowering wavelength
in the energy system...

40:39.565 --> 40:40.532
now.

40:40.566 --> 40:42.898
Reading 18...

40:42.935 --> 40:44.800
fifteen...

40:44.837 --> 40:46.634
thirteen...

40:46.672 --> 40:48.572
eleven...

40:48.607 --> 40:50.234
eight...

40:50.275 --> 40:51.902
five...

40:51.944 --> 40:53.673
three.

40:53.712 --> 40:55.839
Now at the two-centimeter level.

40:55.881 --> 40:58.008
Any reaction, Bridge?

40:58.050 --> 40:59.142
Negative.

40:59.218 --> 41:01.584
I detect no reduction
in the life-form's

41:01.620 --> 41:02.746
rate of energy consumption.

41:02.788 --> 41:05.552
One minute, 30 seconds
to intercept.

41:05.591 --> 41:07.456
Not sour enough.

41:08.761 --> 41:12.094
Leah, take it down further.

41:12.164 --> 41:14.758
Reading one...

41:14.800 --> 41:16.563
point eight...

41:16.602 --> 41:18.433
point four...

41:18.470 --> 41:20.131
point two.

41:24.977 --> 41:27.673
I guess it noticed
what we're doing.

41:27.713 --> 41:30.739
The life-form is emitting
its high-frequency transmission.

41:30.783 --> 41:32.444
Energy consumption is rising.

41:32.484 --> 41:36.944
Captain, the creatures are
accelerating their approach.

41:36.989 --> 41:38.286
They are changing color.

41:38.323 --> 41:39.722
Mr. La Forge!

41:39.758 --> 41:41.953
Captain,
just a little more time.

41:41.994 --> 41:43.393
Leah, nudge it down
even further.

41:43.429 --> 41:44.953
Toward.02.

41:46.532 --> 41:48.659
30 seconds to intercept.

41:48.700 --> 41:50.691
Point oh eight...

41:50.736 --> 41:52.670
oh five...

41:52.704 --> 41:54.535
oh three.

41:54.573 --> 41:56.803
Now at.02 centimeters.

41:56.842 --> 41:59.675
Auxiliary generators
losing power, Captain.

42:12.791 --> 42:15.089
The entity has disengaged, sir.

42:15.194 --> 42:18.391
Power levels are returning
to normal, Captain.

42:24.436 --> 42:26.700
Bring the engines on-line
and take us out of here.

42:26.738 --> 42:28.330
Aye, sir.

42:28.373 --> 42:33.140
Mr. La Forge, Dr. Brahms,
congratulations.

42:35.147 --> 42:37.047
You've weaned the baby.

42:39.651 --> 42:41.642
Good work.

42:41.687 --> 42:43.518
You, too.

42:50.832 --> 42:52.697
Well, yeah. L-I admit it.

42:52.734 --> 42:56.363
I did get a little attached
to that lady in the holodeck.

42:56.404 --> 42:59.430
The computer never told you
that I was married.

42:59.474 --> 43:01.101
I never asked, see?

43:01.175 --> 43:02.938
And the computer is notorious

43:02.977 --> 43:05.002
for not volunteering
information.

43:08.416 --> 43:10.384
You know...

43:10.418 --> 43:12.386
I really owe you an apology.

43:12.420 --> 43:13.387
No. No, you don't.

43:13.421 --> 43:15.389
I should have told you
straight out.

43:15.423 --> 43:17.948
Well, if you had, then I
never would have had a chance

43:17.992 --> 43:20.654
to see the look on your face
when you walked in on me...

43:20.695 --> 43:21.662
and me

43:21.696 --> 43:22.924
in the holodeck.

43:22.964 --> 43:24.625
The look on my face?

43:24.666 --> 43:26.634
How about the look on your face?

43:26.668 --> 43:30.934
I will remember that
for a long, long time.

43:34.442 --> 43:37.002
I wouldn't change a thing.

43:37.045 --> 43:39.946
Except for the way I behaved.

43:39.981 --> 43:44.247
I guess I came here with my own
set of preconceptions about you.

43:46.187 --> 43:50.317
Well, I guess I'm just glad
that I got the opportunity

43:50.358 --> 43:52.986
to get to know you.

43:53.027 --> 43:54.392
The real you.

43:57.598 --> 43:59.725
Me, too.

43:59.767 --> 44:01.359
Worf to La Forge.

44:01.402 --> 44:04.894
There is an incoming message
on subspace for Dr. Brahms.

44:07.241 --> 44:09.038
Acknowledged, Worf.

44:09.077 --> 44:10.408
La Forge out.

44:13.081 --> 44:14.105
My husband.
