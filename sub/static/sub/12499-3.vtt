WEBVTT

00:02.828 --> 00:06.248
Do you know what this is?

00:06.899 --> 00:09.708
Hmm. 2009 Baja Red.

00:09.709 --> 00:12.013
Playful on the nose,
very dry on the palate,

00:12.014 --> 00:14.639
hints of Eucalyptus, Stone
Fruits, and Kalamata Olives.

00:14.640 --> 00:17.241
What? No, it's marijuana.

00:17.242 --> 00:19.911
God, I figured if anyone would
know, it would be you, Denzel.

00:19.912 --> 00:21.913
Why? Because all black men love weed?

00:21.914 --> 00:25.226
No, because you love weed.
Look at your shirt.

00:25.227 --> 00:27.685
Ho, that's right!
Who don't like smokin' up?

00:27.686 --> 00:31.789
Uh, I don't because I'm not in the
sixth grade, and I have shit to do.

00:31.790 --> 00:36.227
I confiscated this from a dirty hippie
50 feet from this ranger station.

00:36.228 --> 00:41.465
Who's got an idea for how to smoke out
these dope growin' draft dodgers?

00:41.466 --> 00:43.894
Come on, guys, get creative.

00:43.895 --> 00:48.275
I know how we can get some inspiration.

00:50.101 --> 00:54.078
Dude. Dude. Dude.
We have to build a rocket...

00:54.079 --> 00:56.970
To spy on the hippies
from outer space, man.

00:56.971 --> 01:02.141
Yeah! But the rocket's gotta be shaped
like a big, hairy dinosaur dick!

01:02.142 --> 01:04.888
With giant, purple pterodactyl wings.

01:04.890 --> 01:07.959
A hairy dinosaur dick with wings?

01:07.960 --> 01:09.585
That is brilliant!

01:09.586 --> 01:11.763
We'll swoop down and
laser gun the bastards!

01:11.764 --> 01:13.364
- Yeah!
- That's it!

01:13.365 --> 01:14.666
I love weed.

01:14.667 --> 01:16.634
Connie! Call NASA.

01:16.635 --> 01:19.370
We need a Jurassic (Bleep) rocket
and a shitload more Funyuns.

01:19.371 --> 01:22.106
We're dead. I can't feel my face.

01:22.107 --> 01:27.207
I think we're dead.
I've got bugs all over me!

01:28.914 --> 01:30.281
Aah!

01:30.282 --> 01:32.682
<i>Brickleberry.</i>

01:36.822 --> 01:39.090
Great, we just wasted twelve hours,

01:39.091 --> 01:41.759
and the only decent idea
we had was attacking them

01:41.760 --> 01:44.228
with a genetically engineered cat robot.

01:44.229 --> 01:45.529
I still think it can work.

01:45.530 --> 01:46.831
Choo, choo! Ch-ch-choo!

01:46.832 --> 01:48.933
No, I'm calling in the Feds.

01:48.934 --> 01:51.703
Why? Denzel and I can
take these hippies down.

01:51.704 --> 01:56.804
Besides, I always wanted
to be an undercover cop.

02:20.132 --> 02:21.132
Eh-eh-eh-eh-eh!

02:21.133 --> 02:22.633
- Eh-eh-eh-eh-eh...
- Get off of me!

02:22.634 --> 02:24.235
Now, the DEA is gonna handle this.

02:24.236 --> 02:25.489
- But Woody, I...
- No!

02:25.490 --> 02:28.539
There's no way in hell I'm
gonna let you screw this up!

02:28.540 --> 02:31.609
You're way too stupid! And as for Denzel...

02:31.610 --> 02:33.860
It's all good.
I don't wanna be no undercover cop.

02:33.861 --> 02:36.280
You don't? But it's so cool!

02:36.281 --> 02:38.682
Hey, could you two idiots
play good cop, black cop

02:38.683 --> 02:41.678
on your own time? I'm calling the DEA.

02:41.679 --> 02:44.321
- Malloy! What are you doing?
- Phone sex.

02:44.322 --> 02:46.924
What's it look like, you crazy,
co-dependent (Bleep) sucker?

02:46.925 --> 02:48.060
Ohh!

02:48.061 --> 02:50.527
Whoa! Malloy, that's even mean for you.

02:50.528 --> 02:52.263
Not as mean as your mom
for getting pregnant

02:52.264 --> 02:55.833
by backing up to a glory
hole in a waffle house.

02:55.834 --> 02:57.969
What are you laughing at, you (Bleep)?

02:57.970 --> 03:00.875
Nice try trying to sneak outta
here, you dump truck with tits.

03:00.876 --> 03:03.174
My God, Malloy. What is happening to you?

03:03.175 --> 03:04.742
Lately, you've been incredibly mean,

03:04.743 --> 03:06.844
and you've been humping...
Ohh, he's (Bleeping) my lunch!

03:06.845 --> 03:08.146
You can eat this in a minute.

03:08.147 --> 03:13.017
Now, stick your finger in
my butt, so I can finish.

03:13.018 --> 03:15.719
Ethel, can we talk?

03:15.720 --> 03:18.622
- Sorry, that's my stomach.
- Connie, are you okay?

03:18.623 --> 03:22.089
Yeah, I'm having a little
bit of a cash flow problem.

03:22.090 --> 03:24.691
Haven't eaten in a week.
Can I borrow some money?

03:24.692 --> 03:26.130
For food? Of course.

03:26.131 --> 03:28.800
No, silly, for my telephone psychic.

03:28.801 --> 03:31.735
I call her all the time.
She's very expensive.

03:31.736 --> 03:35.039
Connie, I am not loaning you money to
throw away on some stupid psychic.

03:35.040 --> 03:36.974
I thought you were my friend, Ethel.

03:36.975 --> 03:39.315
Oh, Connie.

03:41.146 --> 03:44.746
Now, that one was my vagina.

03:50.189 --> 03:51.189
Welcome, gentlemen.

03:51.190 --> 03:54.826
I'm your point man here, Special Detective
Ranger enforcer Steve Williams.

03:54.827 --> 03:57.295
I'm prepared to handle any
sort of secret combat

03:57.296 --> 03:59.763
or spying mission you require of me.

03:59.764 --> 04:03.000
Yes, um, Special Detective Williams.

04:03.001 --> 04:04.702
You're just the man we want to see.

04:04.703 --> 04:06.003
- I am?
- Oh, yeah.

04:06.004 --> 04:07.705
We got a job for you.

04:07.706 --> 04:10.007
Denzel! The Feds are on the ground

04:10.008 --> 04:13.510
for less than five minutes, and I
already landed a key transport mission!

04:13.511 --> 04:14.912
You're carrying their luggage, dumb ass.

04:14.913 --> 04:17.680
I heard Robocop had to do the
same thing on his first day.

04:17.682 --> 04:19.916
You don't wanna become a cop.
Trust me, Steve.

04:19.918 --> 04:21.886
The Jackson family's always been cops.

04:21.887 --> 04:24.989
My father, cop. His father, cop.

04:24.990 --> 04:26.690
His father, cop.

04:26.691 --> 04:28.893
His father, slave.

04:28.894 --> 04:30.494
But he really didn't have a choice.

04:30.495 --> 04:33.331
Wow, that's a lot of cops.
Why didn't you become one too?

04:33.332 --> 04:36.066
Because they all got their asses
killed in the line of duty.

04:36.067 --> 04:38.302
It's just a bunch of pot-growing hippies.

04:38.303 --> 04:40.371
It would be so easy to just go...

04:40.372 --> 04:42.073
Oh, that's disturbing.

04:42.074 --> 04:44.708
Malloy, stop humping the duffel bag!

04:44.709 --> 04:46.978
It's a valise, you peasant.

04:46.979 --> 04:48.512
Don't you snap at me!

04:48.513 --> 04:49.713
What's wrong with him?

04:49.714 --> 04:51.249
It's normal, Woody. It's puberty.

04:51.250 --> 04:54.886
His testicles are producing large amounts
of testosterone, hence the mood swings.

04:54.887 --> 04:56.653
He'll be full-grown practically overnight.

04:56.654 --> 04:58.455
No, I don't want that!

04:58.456 --> 05:02.499
There's got to be some way to stop this.

05:02.500 --> 05:05.096
Aw! Where am I?

05:05.097 --> 05:06.097
Oh, remember, honey?

05:06.098 --> 05:09.400
Daddy took you to the vet to get your...
Teeth cleaned?

05:09.401 --> 05:11.535
My balls are killing me!

05:11.536 --> 05:14.836
Eh, they look all right.

05:15.473 --> 05:16.773
You had me neutered?

05:16.774 --> 05:18.376
Hey, you won't be mean anymore.

05:18.377 --> 05:22.275
Plus, you'll be forever young,
just like Dick Clark.

05:22.276 --> 05:24.148
Steve, I'm starting to think you lied to me

05:24.149 --> 05:25.849
about there being an
amusement park out here.

05:25.850 --> 05:27.751
Why are you so suspicious?

05:27.752 --> 05:30.521
Well, for one, I never heard of
no Six Flags over Brickleberry.

05:30.522 --> 05:34.225
And for two, we are clearly
following those undercover agents.

05:34.226 --> 05:36.460
They are really going to
appreciate us getting their backs

05:36.461 --> 05:38.427
during their top-secret undercover meeting.

05:38.428 --> 05:41.332
What? Steve, I told you I
don't want no part of this.

05:41.333 --> 05:42.849
Oh, great, look who it is.

05:42.850 --> 05:45.411
Our favorite tree cops,
doofus and dick-breath.

05:45.412 --> 05:46.683
Yeah, piss off.

05:46.684 --> 05:51.175
If we see any fish or trees
jaywalking, we'll let you know.

05:51.176 --> 05:54.956
You do that. Affirmative. 10-4.

05:55.414 --> 05:57.815
Here's our chance to do something police-y.

05:57.816 --> 06:00.451
Hold it! Stay clear of
that shed over there.

06:00.452 --> 06:06.257
My two DEA buddies are about to bust some
marijuana farmers, and they are tough...

06:06.258 --> 06:09.560
So tough that they aren't even
wearing bulletproof vests.

06:09.561 --> 06:13.821
Thank you. You have been very helpful.

06:18.603 --> 06:21.738
Hmm... Something must've tipped him off.

06:21.739 --> 06:25.176
Steve, we gotta get outta here!

06:25.177 --> 06:26.610
My name is Nikolai.

06:26.611 --> 06:29.780
You two must be our new
growers from California.

06:29.781 --> 06:31.882
Actually, there's been a huge misunder...

06:31.883 --> 06:35.353
Yeah, we're the new
growers from California!

06:35.354 --> 06:37.654
- Say what?
- What is your name, my friend?

06:37.655 --> 06:39.347
Uh...

06:39.348 --> 06:41.069
I'm...

06:41.070 --> 06:43.491
- Mario?
- Mario what?

06:43.492 --> 06:45.226
Uh...

06:45.227 --> 06:47.730
- Brothers?
- Mario Brothers?

06:47.731 --> 06:51.735
- Then who's this?
- Oh! That's Ted...

06:51.736 --> 06:52.769
Tris.

06:52.770 --> 06:56.370
Ted Tris? And Mario Brothers?

06:57.109 --> 07:00.705
Welcome to the Russian marijuana cartel!

07:00.706 --> 07:03.713
Tell me a little bit about
yourself Mario Brothers.

07:03.714 --> 07:07.016
I'm a plumber, and I've got
a brother named Luigi.

07:07.017 --> 07:10.554
I've also had a bad history with
this fire-breathing turtle.

07:10.555 --> 07:12.455
What the hell are you talking about, Steve?

07:12.456 --> 07:18.161
I see that I'm the only one
that worked on my back story.

07:18.162 --> 07:20.430
As you can see, our crops are suffering.

07:20.431 --> 07:23.739
Last grower did a terrible job.
Sadly, he passed away.

07:23.740 --> 07:24.766
From what?

07:24.767 --> 07:29.339
From me shooting him
multiple times in the brain.

07:29.340 --> 07:31.085
That's not funny.

07:31.086 --> 07:33.217
But that should not be problem for you two.

07:33.218 --> 07:35.378
All you need to do is to make
these sick, near-death plants

07:35.379 --> 07:37.547
flourish like they've
never flourished before.

07:37.548 --> 07:38.832
You have one week.

07:38.833 --> 07:42.754
Uh, hypothetically, what if the
plants need a extra day or two?

07:42.755 --> 07:46.159
That's fine. As long as you
don't mind getting, eh...

07:46.160 --> 07:48.325
How you say? Punched in the kisser?

07:48.326 --> 07:50.927
Punched in the kisser?
Woo, that don't sound so bad.

07:50.928 --> 07:54.927
In Russia, punch means stab
and kisser means anus hole.

07:54.928 --> 07:58.374
A whole week? Heh! Weeks are for pussies.

07:58.375 --> 08:02.050
- We can do it by tomorrow.
- Okay, Mr. Brothers.

08:02.051 --> 08:05.181
Plants grow by tomorrow, or you die.

08:05.182 --> 08:07.462
Good luck!

08:08.379 --> 08:11.013
We've got him right where we want him.

08:11.014 --> 08:12.836
You stupid dumb ass!

08:12.837 --> 08:14.183
How could you promise we
could turn this schwag

08:14.184 --> 08:16.227
into bomb-diggity chronic by tomorrow?

08:16.228 --> 08:19.640
Look at this big-ass field.
It's nothing but seeds and stems.

08:19.641 --> 08:21.015
Don't you know how to grow this stuff?

08:21.016 --> 08:24.065
Steve, I don't grow this shit.
I smoke this shit!

08:24.066 --> 08:25.541
Well, not to worry.

08:25.542 --> 08:28.053
Your pal Mario's got two green thumbs.

08:28.054 --> 08:30.440
Three, if you count my penis.

08:30.441 --> 08:33.202
I should probably get to a hospital.

08:33.203 --> 08:35.315
Stupid Woody trying to change me.

08:35.316 --> 08:38.542
I don't need bear beans to be Malloy.

08:38.543 --> 08:40.876
Woody, you know how fat you are?

08:40.878 --> 08:43.385
Uh... About...

08:43.386 --> 08:46.888
Average for an American man your age.

08:46.889 --> 08:48.718
Ethel, you look lovely.

08:48.719 --> 08:50.281
What the hell am I saying?

08:50.282 --> 08:52.285
Connie, the dyke store called...

08:52.286 --> 08:54.363
And they've apologized...

08:54.364 --> 08:57.369
For their very offensive name.

08:57.370 --> 09:00.847
Grow! Grow, damn you, grow!

09:00.848 --> 09:03.685
Or do you want this to happen to you?

09:03.686 --> 09:05.750
They don't even respond to threats.

09:05.751 --> 09:08.170
We dead. I knew it.

09:08.171 --> 09:11.205
Wait a minute. I remember something.

09:11.206 --> 09:13.843
His testicles are producing
large amounts of testosterone.

09:13.844 --> 09:16.038
He'll be full-grown practically overnight.

09:16.039 --> 09:20.119
- Overnight. Overnight.
- That's it!

09:28.426 --> 09:30.427
Steve, have you lost your goddamn mind?

09:30.428 --> 09:32.667
This is your plan? Bear ball juice?

09:32.668 --> 09:34.495
It's testosterone.

09:34.496 --> 09:37.273
- Didn't you see my thought bubble?
- Man, I'm getting outta here.

09:37.274 --> 09:41.594
White people do some (Bleeped) up shit.

09:43.974 --> 09:46.075
Connie? What the hell are you doing?

09:46.076 --> 09:48.678
You wouldn't loan me money, and
I needed to call my psychic,

09:48.679 --> 09:50.647
so I'm selling this hot ass.

09:50.648 --> 09:52.148
Eh, how's that been going for ya?

09:52.149 --> 09:53.483
Not bad.

09:53.484 --> 09:55.117
Most people speed up.

09:55.118 --> 09:57.568
One guy swerved to hit
me, and a couple hunters

09:57.569 --> 09:59.611
shot at me because they
thought I was a bison.

09:59.612 --> 10:01.104
I tell you what.

10:01.105 --> 10:03.392
Here's a number for a new psychic named...

10:03.393 --> 10:06.663
Madam Ethlia. Uh, Etheliola.

10:06.664 --> 10:09.699
- Eth... Ethelopia.
- Madam Ethelia?

10:09.700 --> 10:12.596
Sure, whatever.
She's the best, and she's totally free.

10:12.597 --> 10:15.007
Hot dog. I'm gonna call her right now.

10:15.008 --> 10:18.140
A-a-all right. See ya, Connie.

10:18.141 --> 10:20.443
- Hello?
- Madam Ethelia?

10:20.444 --> 10:24.113
- My name is Connie.
- Oh, Connie, yes, I know.

10:24.114 --> 10:26.048
I was expecting your call.

10:26.049 --> 10:29.552
Expecting my call? Wow, you are psychic.

10:29.553 --> 10:30.720
Hop on in!

10:30.721 --> 10:33.523
I have always wanted to
have sex with a bison.

10:33.524 --> 10:35.183
Uh...

10:35.184 --> 10:36.979
Man, I hate Mother Nature.

10:36.980 --> 10:40.273
Why'd she have to make all these trees
and scary spiders and animals and shit?

10:40.274 --> 10:42.259
They're coming for me!

10:42.260 --> 10:44.473
No. Just need to stay calm.

10:44.474 --> 10:48.252
I bet this would help squash my paranoia.

10:48.253 --> 10:50.640
- Hey, son.
- Pops?

10:50.641 --> 10:53.493
- Damn, this is some good shit.
- I'm proud of you, boy.

10:53.494 --> 10:55.983
- You finally an undercover cop.
- I don't wanna be!

10:55.984 --> 10:57.514
Some bad dude's about to kill me.

10:57.515 --> 10:59.883
- What should I do?
- Just do what I always did.

10:59.884 --> 11:02.706
Don't fake no funk, don't jiggity-jive,

11:02.707 --> 11:04.767
and if they give you the
smack-'em-whack-'em,

11:04.768 --> 11:07.036
you dipsy-doodle them cats right back.

11:07.037 --> 11:09.053
- What?
- Shit, boy.

11:09.054 --> 11:11.788
You best get with it.

11:11.789 --> 11:13.881
I gotta stop smokin' weed.

11:13.882 --> 11:17.062
Ooh, there's the road!

11:18.602 --> 11:21.370
- Oh, man.
- Morning, Ted Tris!

11:21.371 --> 11:24.206
So excited to see how you make plants grow.

11:24.207 --> 11:27.807
Get in car, or I shoot you.

11:29.112 --> 11:31.314
Hoo, whew! I'm tired.

11:31.315 --> 11:36.210
Oh, boy, I'm gonna just rest here.
You go ahead. I'll catch up.

11:36.211 --> 11:38.400
You're black and funny like the Urkel.

11:38.401 --> 11:42.250
Oh, well. Can you at least cut my
throat before you stab my asshole?

11:42.251 --> 11:44.351
Big enough for ya?

11:44.352 --> 11:48.012
You are super, Mario Brothers!

11:48.954 --> 11:52.724
Mario, you are genius. Brilliant.

11:52.725 --> 11:54.592
You are my number one guy.

11:54.593 --> 11:56.800
Tell me... Anyone disrespect you?

11:56.801 --> 11:58.686
No, no, no, no. Not at all.

11:58.687 --> 12:02.700
Eh, well, earlier, I sneezed, and
Ivan didn't say "bless you."

12:02.701 --> 12:04.034
That... That doesn't...

12:04.035 --> 12:05.530
Holy shit!

12:05.531 --> 12:07.071
And now I have no son.

12:07.072 --> 12:08.673
That was your son?

12:08.674 --> 12:11.486
Oh, my God. You must really like me.

12:11.487 --> 12:14.145
Keep this up, and you will be a made man.

12:14.146 --> 12:18.816
Really? That's even cooler than being
an undercover cop... Not that I am one.

12:18.817 --> 12:22.654
Now, what do you comrades need?
Nothing is too good for you.

12:22.655 --> 12:27.275
Aw, we're simple men. We don't need much.

12:27.760 --> 12:30.328
Steve, this undercover stuff has been fun,

12:30.329 --> 12:32.029
but I'm a little worried
we're getting in too deep.

12:32.030 --> 12:33.498
Don't be ridiculous.

12:33.499 --> 12:35.633
Uh, gentlemen, your lunch as requested...

12:35.634 --> 12:39.833
An endangered white tiger
carcass full of crunch berries.

12:39.834 --> 12:43.759
I told you to take out all the blue ones!

12:43.760 --> 12:45.777
You know, Steve, we aren't
actually doing any police work.

12:45.778 --> 12:47.645
What do you mean?

12:47.646 --> 12:52.049
We've sacrificed everything to eliminate
the evil scourge that is drugs.

12:52.050 --> 12:55.620
Now, come on, let's do some blow and relax.

12:55.621 --> 12:56.854
Doc.

12:56.855 --> 12:59.791
Is it possible to reattach
a pair of testicles?

12:59.792 --> 13:01.258
No.

13:01.259 --> 13:03.227
That's what a licensed doctor would say.

13:03.228 --> 13:07.573
But lucky for you, I have an unhealthy
obsession with experimental medicine.

13:07.574 --> 13:10.188
Bring me your gonads, and I'll
be happy to reattach them.

13:10.189 --> 13:16.089
Heck, for the right price, I'd
even sew a dick to your forehead.

13:16.750 --> 13:19.009
- Hola.
- Hi, Madame Ethelia.

13:19.010 --> 13:22.190
Will I find true love?

13:23.547 --> 13:24.982
Hola.

13:24.983 --> 13:27.785
What's next month's $5 footlong gonna be?

13:27.786 --> 13:30.455
Why do my pits smell like fried chicken?

13:30.456 --> 13:32.933
How many fingers am I holding up?

13:32.934 --> 13:34.792
When will the robots take over?

13:34.793 --> 13:37.362
- Ah! Stop!
- Oh, Ethel, please.

13:37.363 --> 13:41.666
If you keep screaming, we'll
never find my car keys.

13:41.667 --> 13:43.901
Woody, that pot farm is
bigger than we thought.

13:43.902 --> 13:45.737
It's run by the Russian Cartel.

13:45.738 --> 13:47.438
I've infiltrated the organization,

13:47.439 --> 13:50.174
and they're inducting me into
their inner circle tonight.

13:50.175 --> 13:53.244
Wow, Steve, I'm impressed.
Did you gather any evidence?

13:53.245 --> 13:54.645
Of course I did.

13:54.646 --> 13:57.248
I am Nikolai. I am a bad man.

13:57.249 --> 13:59.116
I grow drugs. Then I sell them.

13:59.117 --> 14:01.051
That's you on the tape, Steve.

14:01.052 --> 14:04.722
Duh, it's a reenactment. I wasn't gonna
take a recorder in there. They'd kill me.

14:04.723 --> 14:06.667
Well, congratulations, Steve.

14:06.668 --> 14:09.554
You're the stupidest son of a
bitch in the history of Earth.

14:09.555 --> 14:11.370
I don't have to take this.

14:11.371 --> 14:13.395
I'm going back to the cartel for good.

14:13.396 --> 14:15.933
They respect me and think I'm a genius!

14:15.934 --> 14:17.167
Hey, genius.

14:17.168 --> 14:20.905
You just walked into the shitter.

14:20.906 --> 14:23.789
Steve, do you know where Woody hid my
balls, I can't find them anywhere?

14:23.790 --> 14:25.680
Balls? What balls? I didn't take any balls.

14:25.681 --> 14:29.566
I didn't say you took them.
But I will say nice outfit. Looks snazzy.

14:29.567 --> 14:32.142
Did I just say snazzy? Okay. I wanna die.

14:32.143 --> 14:34.681
Come on, Denzel. Let's get back to work.

14:34.682 --> 14:36.814
Steve, I'm staying here. You should too.

14:36.815 --> 14:38.951
We're in over our heads, man.
It's not safe.

14:38.952 --> 14:40.792
I can't believe you're giving up.

14:40.793 --> 14:43.420
You are a disgrace to your family name.

14:43.421 --> 14:47.799
Jackson? I'm pretty sure I'm not
the one who disgraced that name.

14:47.800 --> 14:49.467
What is matter, Mario?

14:49.468 --> 14:51.268
Aren't you excited about initiation?

14:51.269 --> 14:53.482
Eh, my stupid boss...

14:53.483 --> 14:58.142
Er, Woody, who is not my boss
because I'm not a Park Ranger.

14:58.143 --> 15:00.978
I'm a drug manager.
Is that what we're called?

15:00.979 --> 15:03.314
This Woody, he disrespected you?

15:03.315 --> 15:07.351
- I will take care of it.
- Thank you.

15:07.352 --> 15:10.412
No "gesundheit," mama?

15:10.623 --> 15:12.723
No one in this family has manners.

15:12.724 --> 15:14.325
It's the truth, Malloy.

15:14.326 --> 15:16.393
I don't know what happened to your testes.

15:16.394 --> 15:18.095
Jeesh, I'm just as upset as you are.

15:18.096 --> 15:23.556
Oh, have you been castrated this week?
Because I have.

15:24.636 --> 15:29.616
You've played Mario
Brothers for the last time.

15:32.628 --> 15:36.102
Mario, before you're accepted
into our inner circle,

15:36.103 --> 15:38.296
you need to go through rite of passage.

15:38.297 --> 15:40.198
Sure, what is it? Swallow a goldfish?

15:40.199 --> 15:42.633
Shotgun a beer?
Jerk off a mall Santa? What?

15:42.634 --> 15:46.087
Kill this man, and you will
be cartel member for life.

15:46.088 --> 15:49.540
Best part is this is your mortal enemy.

15:49.541 --> 15:51.581
Bowser?

15:51.977 --> 15:53.481
Steve?

15:53.482 --> 15:55.245
Who is Steve?

15:55.246 --> 15:58.115
I-I don't know. Not me, that's for sure.

15:58.116 --> 16:00.084
Nobody calls Mario "Steve"!

16:00.085 --> 16:02.785
Please kill him.

16:03.555 --> 16:05.056
Ethel, you look so tired.

16:05.057 --> 16:07.391
What, do you got stuff on your mind?

16:07.392 --> 16:09.526
You should totally call madam Ethelia.

16:09.527 --> 16:11.863
I talk to her all day and all night.

16:11.864 --> 16:15.733
Connie, what if you found out that
the psychic you've been talking to

16:15.734 --> 16:20.404
wasn't a real psychic, but just a
good friend with a really great body?

16:20.405 --> 16:22.106
Hmm, let's see.

16:22.107 --> 16:24.608
I guess I'd be as crushed as I've ever been

16:24.609 --> 16:28.279
and might even kill myself
and a few co-workers too.

16:28.280 --> 16:29.480
Hmm, okay.

16:29.481 --> 16:34.451
Well, what if she made, like, a huge
prediction and, just got it way wrong?

16:34.452 --> 16:36.387
Would that make you stop
believing in psychics?

16:36.388 --> 16:37.922
Yeah, I guess it would.

16:37.923 --> 16:41.272
Well, you should call her right now.

16:41.273 --> 16:46.063
Connie, so glad you called.
I have a big, huge prediction for you.

16:46.064 --> 16:48.233
Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy. What is it?

16:48.234 --> 16:52.703
Um... The morning sun
will turn black as night.

16:52.704 --> 16:55.138
All the birds will fall from the sky.

16:55.139 --> 16:58.581
Uh, also, blood will flow from...

16:58.582 --> 17:00.571
Your head and, uh...

17:00.572 --> 17:03.014
Your left, um cankle.

17:03.015 --> 17:06.194
Oh, no, not my cankle.

17:07.152 --> 17:10.186
I hope everyone's okay.
Should I do something?

17:10.188 --> 17:13.457
No. No, Denzel.
Don't wanna end up like your daddy.

17:13.458 --> 17:17.661
Oh, I see. You don't wanna end up
like the old man, pushin' up petals,

17:17.662 --> 17:19.896
- discoing with dirt?
- No, pops, I was just...

17:19.897 --> 17:22.433
What's up, boy?
You all 'fraidy like a house cat?

17:22.434 --> 17:26.034
Yes, yes! I'm 'fraidy, okay?

17:26.171 --> 17:28.105
Because I don't wanna die like you, pops.

17:28.106 --> 17:29.640
Let me tell you something, son.

17:29.641 --> 17:32.716
Them corner boys may have
iced me, but you know what?

17:32.717 --> 17:36.213
At least I went out doing the right
thing with my head held high.

17:36.214 --> 17:42.114
Slammin', blammin', whammin', jammin',
prammin', crammin', dammin', lammin'.

17:42.187 --> 17:44.288
Can you honestly say that about yourself?

17:44.289 --> 17:48.192
I can't say that at all because I don't
know what the (Bleep) you saying.

17:48.193 --> 17:49.393
Steve, please.

17:49.394 --> 17:50.761
Don't kill me.

17:50.762 --> 17:54.565
I'm sorry I called you the stupidest
son of a bitch on the planet.

17:54.566 --> 18:00.386
I'm sure there are plenty of
assholes dumber than you are!

18:00.772 --> 18:02.539
Steve, if you kill me, I'll fire you!

18:02.540 --> 18:05.142
Come on, Mario. What are you waiting for?

18:05.143 --> 18:07.363
Kill him!

18:09.747 --> 18:11.715
I'm sorry. That man's right.

18:11.716 --> 18:13.451
My name is Steve.

18:13.452 --> 18:15.853
I'm a tree cop, and proud of it.

18:15.854 --> 18:20.140
And now, I'm going to arrest all of you.

18:20.141 --> 18:24.595
Okay. How about if I only
arrest a couple of you?

18:24.596 --> 18:27.598
Stop, everyone! Or I destroy these.

18:27.599 --> 18:29.566
You bastard, you stole my fun plums!

18:29.567 --> 18:33.471
That's right. These fun plums are
the secret behind your giant weed.

18:33.472 --> 18:36.807
And if you shoot me,
you'll just be shooting...

18:36.808 --> 18:38.608
No!

18:40.076 --> 18:42.656
My cub makers!

18:46.476 --> 18:47.718
They're gone!

18:47.719 --> 18:50.669
Okay, the bear lost his cub makers.

18:50.670 --> 18:53.130
Now you die.

18:53.303 --> 18:58.029
Yo, jive turkeys!
Pimp trampy and shrimp scampi!

18:58.030 --> 19:01.270
And, uh, I don't know.

19:25.298 --> 19:27.806
Connie, how long are you
gonna stare at the sun?

19:27.807 --> 19:30.029
I am pretty sure nothing is gonna happen.

19:30.030 --> 19:33.450
Oh, no? Then what's that?

19:38.270 --> 19:40.204
Oh! Ow!

19:40.205 --> 19:42.005
Oh!

19:42.107 --> 19:45.209
Oh, my God. The sun. The birds.

19:45.210 --> 19:47.711
The blood from my head and bloated cankle.

19:47.712 --> 19:49.180
Miss Ethelia was right.

19:49.181 --> 19:52.550
I'm gonna call her every day
for the rest of my life.

19:52.551 --> 19:55.731
Oh, shit. I'm psychic.

20:02.794 --> 20:06.797
Stop! Or I'll slit his fat,
bullfrog-like throat.

20:06.798 --> 20:08.299
I don't think so.

20:08.300 --> 20:11.660
- Oh!
- Oops! Heh, sorry.

20:13.738 --> 20:17.998
There's something wrong with this gun.

20:18.385 --> 20:20.589
I warmed it up for you.

20:20.590 --> 20:23.814
I feel like hammered shit.

20:23.815 --> 20:25.316
Rest easy, boss.

20:25.317 --> 20:26.850
I'm glad everything turned out fine.

20:26.851 --> 20:28.719
Yeah, Steve. I'm sorry I doubted ya.

20:28.720 --> 20:32.595
Breaking up that Russian
Cartel took some balls.

20:32.596 --> 20:35.426
Speaking of balls, mine are killing me.

20:35.427 --> 20:37.561
What? Doc, what the hell...

20:37.562 --> 20:40.664
Where are my balls?
Where the hell are my balls?

20:40.665 --> 20:44.335
Oh, it's quite simple, Woody.
You looked dead, and I hate taking pulses.

20:44.336 --> 20:47.538
And since you are an organ donor...

20:47.539 --> 20:49.373
Payback's a bitch.

20:49.374 --> 20:51.234
Aah!
