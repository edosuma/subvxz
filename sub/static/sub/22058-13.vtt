[Murphy] Welcome to Zona.

00:09.676 --> 00:11.178
<i>I can't wait for you to meet the Founder.</i>

00:11.261 --> 00:12.679
We've met before.

00:12.763 --> 00:15.265
[Murphy]
<i>Without him, all this wouldn't be here.</i>

00:15.807 --> 00:17.768
Come with me. You're no longer safe here.

00:17.893 --> 00:18.852
[indistinct grunting]

00:23.232 --> 00:26.401
These visions that you're having,
don't ignore them.

00:26.485 --> 00:28.737
Unconscious is a very powerful thing.

00:29.238 --> 00:30.614
I mean we want to believe.

00:31.031 --> 00:32.658
But you've got to give us
something to believe in.

00:32.824 --> 00:33.742
Look.

00:34.284 --> 00:35.118
[grunting]

00:35.202 --> 00:36.119
[shuddering]

00:36.203 --> 00:37.412
What'd you see?

00:37.496 --> 00:39.540
I felt it. What she's feeling.

00:40.916 --> 00:43.502
[Warren] <i>We have reason to believe
that someone intends to launch</i>

00:43.585 --> 00:47.297
<i>a biological attack on all
surviving humans and zombies.</i>

00:47.381 --> 00:48.966
Your thumbs would've given us access

00:49.049 --> 00:52.594
to change the launch codes
for some kind of doomsday weapon.

00:53.011 --> 00:54.471
You don't need my thumbprint.

00:54.555 --> 00:56.640
You need the thumbprint
of the person who was president

00:56.723 --> 00:57.849
during the outbreak.

00:58.559 --> 00:59.977
Why, hello, Mr. President.

03:09.523 --> 03:12.609
[Murphy] You know, if you just told us
what you were looking for,

03:13.026 --> 03:15.028
it'd be a lot easier to help find it.

03:19.741 --> 03:21.118
I'll know it when I see it.

03:23.620 --> 03:24.538
[faint growling]

03:24.621 --> 03:25.747
We're getting close.

03:27.541 --> 03:28.875
We're on the move.

03:28.959 --> 03:31.086
You know this whole place
is radiated, right?

03:31.586 --> 03:32.796
Whose fault is that?

03:32.963 --> 03:35.215
Wasn't my idea to have
a third strike weapon.

03:35.716 --> 03:37.759
Now we're all gonna get cancer
in 20 years.

03:38.093 --> 03:38.969
Let's hope.

[zombie screeching]

03:40.762 --> 03:41.596
Shit!

03:41.680 --> 03:43.598
Watch it, Murphy. We're gonna need him.

03:44.349 --> 03:45.475
[Murphy] Him?

03:46.977 --> 03:49.980
Come on, tasty snack.
They'll bite your ass too.

04:09.249 --> 04:10.459
[groaning]

04:25.390 --> 04:27.100
Warren? Whatcha doin'?

04:28.852 --> 04:29.811
Warren?

04:33.565 --> 04:35.442
[Doc] She's got that look again.

04:36.526 --> 04:37.694
Here. Hold this.

04:42.616 --> 04:43.825
What are you looking at?

04:47.579 --> 04:48.830
-Stand here.
-What?

04:50.081 --> 04:51.792
Stand here and put your hands up.

04:52.709 --> 04:53.627
Put my hands up?

04:57.547 --> 04:58.548
Higher.

05:03.929 --> 05:05.347
Is this really necessary?

05:05.430 --> 05:07.224
I haven't worn deodorant
in like three weeks.

05:07.307 --> 05:09.810
Murphy, would you shut up for once
and do what the lady says.

05:09.893 --> 05:11.353
You do stink though.

05:11.478 --> 05:12.562
[Sarge shushing]

05:18.819 --> 05:20.529
Seriously, does anyone know
what's going on?

05:20.612 --> 05:21.446
[Doc shushing]

05:21.905 --> 05:23.365
Get up on the rock
and put your hands together.

05:24.741 --> 05:27.494
Well, of course.
'Cause that makes perfect sense.

05:33.500 --> 05:34.501
Sarge?

05:43.218 --> 05:44.803
Seriously, does anyone know
what's going on?

05:44.970 --> 05:45.929
[shushing aggressively]

06:10.912 --> 06:12.747
[sighs] Can I put my arms down now?

06:18.253 --> 06:19.963
Hey, would you look at that.

06:24.759 --> 06:25.594
Yes, open it.

06:54.998 --> 06:58.168
Explain to me again why we got
to bring President Klutz along.

06:58.251 --> 07:00.378
I mean why can't we just bring his thumbs?

07:00.462 --> 07:02.714
Because his thumbs would shrivel
and might not work.

07:02.881 --> 07:04.883
What does that other fellow want
with those thumbs then?

07:04.966 --> 07:06.509
Almost there!

07:06.593 --> 07:08.178
Maybe he just wanted to keep us
from getting them.

07:08.845 --> 07:11.264
Kaya thought that he may have
already changed the launch codes

07:11.348 --> 07:12.891
when he hacked in from Northern Light.

07:14.351 --> 07:15.518
[Sarge] Sorry about that!

07:16.686 --> 07:17.687
Got him!

07:18.063 --> 07:18.980
[Sarge] Comin' down!

07:21.816 --> 07:22.943
That's gonna leave a mark.

07:24.319 --> 07:25.403
On the floor.

07:26.655 --> 07:27.822
[loud thud]

07:36.414 --> 07:37.749
I think he likes you.

07:38.291 --> 07:39.834
You're not my type, friend.

07:40.752 --> 07:44.506
So, where to next
on our VIP tour from Hell?

07:46.091 --> 07:48.385
-Thataway.
-Come on, sir.

07:49.219 --> 07:53.682
Step. Step. Step. There. Whoa.
All right, I got him. I got him.

08:05.694 --> 08:07.237
El Presidente's awful quiet.

08:07.320 --> 08:09.197
Murphy must be getting his mojo back.

08:11.741 --> 08:13.827
It's like walking a damn slinky.

08:13.910 --> 08:16.246
-Tell me about it.
-I just did.

08:19.457 --> 08:20.500
[zombie breathing coarsely]

08:26.840 --> 08:28.258
Ugly sumbitch.

08:29.426 --> 08:30.802
He could use some sun.

08:31.302 --> 08:33.471
Probably hasn't seen daylight
in eight years.

08:42.647 --> 08:43.898
He's blind.

08:51.489 --> 08:52.449

09:10.175 --> 09:13.053
Blind zombies. What'll they think of next?

09:13.344 --> 09:15.847
You know what that means, Murphy?
They're tracking by sound.

09:15.930 --> 09:17.599
So no farting.

09:18.058 --> 09:19.059
Me?

09:19.142 --> 09:21.895
I'm a perfect gentleman
compared to General Off-gas here.

09:30.653 --> 09:31.905
I got to get down there.

09:31.988 --> 09:34.282
Must be 30, maybe 40 flights down.

09:34.365 --> 09:36.117
What are we gonna do
with Stumbles the Clown here?

09:38.495 --> 09:41.956
-We got to carry him.
-Carry him? That'll take forever!

09:45.752 --> 09:47.837
Maybe we can make a stretcher
to carry him on.

09:48.630 --> 09:50.507
Good idea. So here's what we'll do.

09:50.632 --> 09:51.800
[body thudding]

09:52.884 --> 09:53.885
Whoops!

09:53.968 --> 09:54.803
Murphy!

09:54.928 --> 09:56.221
-Really?
-He fell.

09:56.304 --> 09:58.223
Did you just throw
the President of the United States

09:58.306 --> 09:59.390
down 30 flights of stairs?

09:59.557 --> 10:03.728
Ex-president. And he fell. I swear.

10:04.646 --> 10:05.814
Saved us some time.

10:05.939 --> 10:06.773
Right?

10:07.148 --> 10:09.359
We better get down there
before he wanders off.

10:11.194 --> 10:12.612
He'll be fine.

10:43.935 --> 10:45.145
[zombies munching]

10:53.862 --> 10:55.363
Yeah, more blind ones.

[Murphy]
And they're snacking on the President.

10:59.409 --> 11:00.743
I got it.

11:12.547 --> 11:14.382
8,452.

11:18.469 --> 11:19.679
And 53.

11:19.762 --> 11:21.598
Get President Thumbs here and let's go.

11:22.640 --> 11:24.100
See. He's fine.

11:26.811 --> 11:27.812
Fine?

11:28.021 --> 11:29.856
He looks like he fell off a cliff
in a cartoon.

11:30.023 --> 11:31.357
Just grab his legs, will ya?

11:33.234 --> 11:34.694
All right. Ready?

11:34.861 --> 11:35.695
Pull.

11:45.079 --> 11:46.331
[groaning]

11:46.414 --> 11:48.917
There you go. Walk it off, Prez.

11:49.125 --> 11:51.127
Yes, sir. Come on. Look alive.

11:53.463 --> 11:55.256
All right. Let's go.

11:56.591 --> 11:58.134
Shh. Let's go.

12:01.554 --> 12:02.597
Here we go.

12:22.784 --> 12:24.243
First strike, this way.

12:25.453 --> 12:27.455
That's the strategic air command eagle.

12:30.375 --> 12:31.626
Second strike's over here.

12:33.586 --> 12:35.463
Destruction delivered worldwide.

12:37.423 --> 12:38.549
Catchy.

12:43.346 --> 12:44.597
[Murphy] Hey, check this one out.

12:44.931 --> 12:48.393
Third Strike Command. Kill, kill, kill.

12:52.730 --> 12:54.315
Fourth strike weapon?

13:13.459 --> 13:14.502
This way.

13:18.297 --> 13:19.257
Cafeteria.

13:20.508 --> 13:22.051
Wouldn't you rather go that way?

13:22.176 --> 13:24.137
I'll bet they got a swell cafeteria.

13:24.220 --> 13:26.681
Sugar packets. Stale crackers.

13:27.432 --> 13:28.474
No?

13:28.975 --> 13:31.227
Why do we always got to go
the way of the skull?

13:50.872 --> 13:51.873
Hold.

13:53.791 --> 13:55.543
[low coarsely moan]

14:06.137 --> 14:07.346

-[10K] Over here.

15:13.454 --> 15:14.664
Where did that come from?

15:17.708 --> 15:18.918
Somebody up there doesn't like us.

15:19.001 --> 15:20.920
I don't think God
has anything to do with this.

15:21.003 --> 15:22.922
No, for real.
Somebody's up there chucking zombies.

15:23.005 --> 15:23.840
Incoming!

15:25.842 --> 15:26.884
[growling]

15:27.760 --> 15:28.594
You?

15:38.771 --> 15:41.482
If that's the same Zona bastard
that hacked Northern Light,

15:41.566 --> 15:42.567
he has the launch codes.

15:42.650 --> 15:44.485
We can't let him
get to the drone before us.

15:44.652 --> 15:45.611
Any ideas?

15:46.529 --> 15:50.116
I'm on a need-to-know basis.
When I need to know, I'll know.

15:51.742 --> 15:52.743
This way.

What is that, Latin? How'd you know that?

16:26.652 --> 16:29.780
<i>Ad Omnia Finem.</i>
"To the end of everything."

16:30.573 --> 16:31.824
You speak Latin?

16:31.908 --> 16:33.159
-Not a word.
-[keypad beeping]

16:44.670 --> 16:46.088

Keep coming.

16:50.593 --> 16:52.220
[indistinct rhythmic beeping]

16:52.303 --> 16:53.471
You're safe now.

16:55.139 --> 16:56.682
It's nice to see you again.

17:03.814 --> 17:04.815
Dr. Teller?

17:06.359 --> 17:07.193
Hello, Roberta.

17:09.195 --> 17:10.571
We have a lot to talk about.

17:33.386 --> 17:35.179
I bet you have a lot of questions.

17:35.388 --> 17:36.514
Uh, yes.

17:38.516 --> 17:39.767
Starting with...

17:40.560 --> 17:41.561
where am I?

17:42.019 --> 17:42.853
Zona.

17:42.937 --> 17:44.730
You were shot and almost died.

17:45.356 --> 17:48.150
We put you into an induced coma
while you healed.

17:48.317 --> 17:50.194
Luckily, the bullet passed through Murphy,

17:50.278 --> 17:52.280
and that seems to have given you
some kind of immunity.

17:53.239 --> 17:54.490
What about Murphy?

17:54.574 --> 17:55.866
He survived too.

17:57.451 --> 17:59.161
He's a reluctant hero now.

18:00.871 --> 18:02.707
He's donating his blood for a new vaccine.

18:03.749 --> 18:04.917
Thank you.

18:05.418 --> 18:06.502
For what?

18:07.795 --> 18:08.963
For waking me up.

18:10.256 --> 18:11.299
I have a reason.

18:12.383 --> 18:13.968
Our world is still in grave danger.

18:15.177 --> 18:17.013
I believe that we've reached
an inflection point

18:17.096 --> 18:19.265
that might be more significant
for life on the planet

18:19.348 --> 18:20.558
than the zombie apocalypse.

18:20.641 --> 18:22.852
Except this time
the danger is from ourselves.

18:30.067 --> 18:32.945
There's still time to save
what's left of humanity.

18:34.488 --> 18:35.489
And, uh...

18:35.990 --> 18:37.617
you're the only one who can do it.

18:40.786 --> 18:41.621
Again?

19:11.609 --> 19:12.777
What do you think she sees?

19:13.486 --> 19:14.528
I'm not sure...

19:15.279 --> 19:16.405
I'm not sure I want to know.

19:33.464 --> 19:34.882
This is what it's all about.

19:35.007 --> 19:37.968
What you're seeing is a mockup
of the launch control panel

19:38.052 --> 19:41.138
for a Doomsday Weapon
code named Black Rainbow.

19:41.263 --> 19:42.348
Launch control?

19:43.265 --> 19:44.767
What, for some kind of nukes?

19:45.309 --> 19:47.269
We already launched
what was left of those.

19:47.353 --> 19:50.898
No nukes. Something worse.
A fourth strike weapon.

19:51.148 --> 19:54.068
We're going to repurpose
the ultimate weapon of mass destruction

19:54.151 --> 19:56.320
and use it to make the world new again.

19:58.489 --> 20:00.491
I know, it's a lot to grok all at once.

20:00.574 --> 20:02.493
But you're going to have a lot of help.

20:02.910 --> 20:06.080
By the time you get there,
you'll know exactly what to do.

20:08.666 --> 20:09.625
[sighs]

20:13.838 --> 20:14.922
[timer counting down]

20:16.215 --> 20:18.008
Looks like that clock is running down.

20:20.761 --> 20:22.096
I think somebody beat us to it.

20:25.057 --> 20:26.225
[machines beeping up]

[softly] Do you think we should wake her?

20:35.693 --> 20:37.194
Come on. Don't mess with her mojo.

20:54.086 --> 20:55.212
Argh!

21:15.649 --> 21:18.068
Hey, guys! We got some locals
coming this way.

21:18.903 --> 21:20.029
Shut the door.

21:20.362 --> 21:21.197
What's the code?

21:21.280 --> 21:23.199
-What's the door code?
-Warren?

21:23.282 --> 21:24.575
Warren, we need the code.

21:24.658 --> 21:26.869
Warren, the code! Warren!

21:27.745 --> 21:29.079
Don't try to remember everything.

21:29.789 --> 21:31.791
Just relax.
Let your subconscious do the work.

21:47.598 --> 21:48.557

21:50.684 --> 21:51.936
Here comes everybody!

21:52.144 --> 21:53.729
Everybody and their mother!

21:54.647 --> 21:55.815
8,454.

21:56.148 --> 21:58.317
If we don't get this door closed
you might make it to 10,000.

22:01.987 --> 22:03.739
What do you think happens
when it gets to zero?

22:04.740 --> 22:06.408
I mean, really,
how much worse can things get?

22:06.575 --> 22:08.786
-Ask her.
-We need that code!

22:09.370 --> 22:12.873
Hey. Hey, Warren? Chief? Chief?

22:16.335 --> 22:17.294
[beeping]

22:24.927 --> 22:26.220
We need that door code!

22:26.303 --> 22:27.805
Or a lot more ammo!

22:29.223 --> 22:31.225
Warren, snap out of it! We need the code!

22:36.564 --> 22:37.731
OK.

22:38.524 --> 22:40.901
Typing in new launch codes.

22:41.819 --> 22:42.903
Now what?

22:43.112 --> 22:46.949
Where it asks for the geographic area
to be treated, select all.

22:47.992 --> 22:49.451
Selecting all.

22:50.494 --> 22:51.537
Who do you think she's talking to?

22:52.079 --> 22:53.080
I don't know.

22:54.915 --> 22:56.041
[alarm buzzes]

23:18.606 --> 23:19.648
What's in these?

23:19.940 --> 23:21.567
The end of the world as we know it.

23:21.650 --> 23:24.486
And the beginning of a new world
we can't even imagine.

23:26.238 --> 23:29.074
<i>These two cylinders contain
enough chemical agent</i>

23:29.158 --> 23:30.743
<i>to cover the entire Northern Hemisphere.</i>

23:31.910 --> 23:34.455
<i>Prevailing winds
will spread our cure globally</i>

23:34.538 --> 23:35.914
<i>within a few years.</i>

23:46.925 --> 23:48.260
Once you start the final countdown,

23:48.344 --> 23:50.429
you only have three minutes
to change the cylinders.

23:50.512 --> 23:51.764
But remember, whatever you do...

23:51.847 --> 23:54.099
Warren! Warren, wake up!
We need your help!

23:54.224 --> 23:55.225
[Dr. Teller inaudible]

23:55.476 --> 23:57.436
-Murphy?
-We need the door code.

23:58.979 --> 23:59.938
Eight, nine, zero, nine.

24:00.356 --> 24:01.815

24:03.025 --> 24:03.901
[groaning]

24:16.205 --> 24:17.164
All clear!

24:19.583 --> 24:20.501
It was Teller.

24:20.918 --> 24:22.002
Dr. Teller?

24:22.461 --> 24:23.837
He woke me up during my coma

24:23.921 --> 24:27.174
to train me to stop Zona's plan
to launch Black Rainbow.

24:27.383 --> 24:29.009
Hold on.
You mean that dude from Mercy Labs?

24:29.093 --> 24:30.344
The one that The Man was after?

24:30.427 --> 24:33.472
Yeah, he developed an aerosol vaccine.
That's what's in the cylinders.

24:33.555 --> 24:35.974
I've got to change them
for the cylinders of Black Rain.

24:45.651 --> 24:48.195
OK. When I give you the signal,

24:48.278 --> 24:50.698
you need to turn these two keys
to launch the drone.

24:50.781 --> 24:52.741
At the same time,
you need the president's thumb

24:52.825 --> 24:54.993
to push the red launch button
in the middle.

24:55.536 --> 24:56.412
Whoa, whoa.

24:56.537 --> 24:58.414
Mr. President, not now.

25:00.082 --> 25:02.710
-You need to keep an eye on him.
-And what are you gonna do?

25:03.001 --> 25:04.753
I'm gonna change the cylinders
on the drone.

25:07.256 --> 25:09.383
I've got to go alone.

25:11.301 --> 25:14.012
-We go where you go, boss.
-You can't ditch us now.

25:15.055 --> 25:16.724
You got to stay here and turn the keys.

25:18.350 --> 25:20.853
Where I'm going, no one can follow.

25:25.232 --> 25:29.695
If you get to Newmerica,
and you find Addy, Sun Mei, or Red,

25:29.778 --> 25:31.321
you tell them I love them.

25:49.757 --> 25:51.550
And if I'm ever in a coma again,

25:52.968 --> 25:54.052
don't wake me.

26:20.454 --> 26:21.497

[keypad beeps]

26:53.320 --> 26:54.321
[door closing]

27:10.170 --> 27:11.839
You're too late, Lieutenant Warren.

27:13.757 --> 27:16.218
Your actions have been noble, heroic even,

27:16.343 --> 27:17.928
but ultimately misguided.

27:18.720 --> 27:20.013
Misguide this.

27:29.064 --> 27:30.190
[Warren grunting]

27:31.859 --> 27:33.986
-We have to help her!
-Chief said to stay here!

27:34.069 --> 27:35.195
He's shooting at her!

27:37.072 --> 27:38.282
[both grunting]

27:52.838 --> 27:54.756
Nevermind. Warren kicked his ass.

27:56.174 --> 27:58.802
She's got the vaccine,
and she's headed for the drone.

27:59.219 --> 28:02.097
-We better get those keys ready.
-We still got a situation here.

28:03.432 --> 28:04.433

28:07.686 --> 28:08.520
I'm out.

28:45.933 --> 28:47.434
[Dr. Teller]
It's a tight fit just for maintenance.

28:47.517 --> 28:48.810
You wouldn't want to fly in there.

28:49.269 --> 28:52.272
Now remember, the red canister
goes in your right hand,

28:52.397 --> 28:55.234
the blue in your left.
Where do the canisters go?

28:57.110 --> 28:58.654
Red in my right,

28:59.863 --> 29:01.114
blue in my left.

29:13.585 --> 29:15.545
Blue goes in my left hand.

29:16.046 --> 29:18.298
Left hand, blue canister first.

29:21.677 --> 29:22.678
[canister hisses]

29:24.721 --> 29:27.516
You're almost done, Roberta.
Just install the red cylinder.

29:29.184 --> 29:30.060
[canister hisses]

29:33.021 --> 29:34.189
What happened?

29:34.356 --> 29:36.942
Our simulations indicate
there's a 78% chance

29:37.025 --> 29:39.861
for release of some gas
during the loading routine.

29:39.987 --> 29:41.905
That's why you have to do this alone.

29:48.328 --> 29:52.082
If I do this, I'm not coming back, am I?

29:52.165 --> 29:54.835
If you don't do this,
humanity's not coming back.

30:16.440 --> 30:17.524
[canister hisses]

30:25.615 --> 30:28.410
That's it. That's the signal.
We have to turn those keys.

30:28.827 --> 30:31.204
OK, Mr. President, it's showtime.

30:31.288 --> 30:32.247
Hang on, Murphy.

30:32.331 --> 30:34.583
Doc, you turn the left key.
Sarge, you turn the right.

30:34.666 --> 30:37.044
-Wait for my signal.
-I got it. Go. Go.

30:37.127 --> 30:39.046
We got to wait till Warren
clears out of there first.

30:39.171 --> 30:42.466
She said to wait for the signal.
She signaled. We have to do this.

30:42.549 --> 30:43.383

Lieutenant Warren?

[shuddering]

32:22.941 --> 32:24.734
Sorry about the fire and brimstone.

32:26.027 --> 32:29.197
We needed an image so strong
it would imprint on your subconscious.

32:29.322 --> 32:31.408
So we could bury your mission
commands deep in your psyche

32:31.491 --> 32:33.743
where they'll be ready when you need them.

32:35.537 --> 32:36.872
Why the secrecy?

32:38.707 --> 32:40.333
Some plans are best kept hidden,

32:41.168 --> 32:42.461
even from ourselves.

32:43.879 --> 32:45.130
What's that supposed to mean?

You're only one step from
completing your training. But, uh...

personally thank you for your sacrifice.

on behalf of everyone in Zona
