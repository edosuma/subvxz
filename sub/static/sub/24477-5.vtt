00:01.102 --> 00:02.770
The final season of New Girl

00:02.803 --> 00:04.938
celebrates friends to the end.

00:04.972 --> 00:06.807
I'm gonna go open
a bottle of wine.
Pink okay?

00:06.840 --> 00:08.476
Catch all-new episodes Tuesdays.

00:08.509 --> 00:10.478
And check out
our other Fox shows--

00:10.511 --> 00:12.746
LA to Vegas, Brooklyn Nine-Nine,

00:12.780 --> 00:14.615
-and The Last Man on Earth.
-(laughs)

00:14.648 --> 00:15.749
Only on Fox.

00:17.017 --> 00:20.521
-Mmm.
-SCHMIDT: Can you two

00:20.554 --> 00:23.791
please tell us
why you summoned us here?

00:23.824 --> 00:25.259
WINSTON: Thank you for coming.
It is appreciated,

00:25.293 --> 00:27.361
especially since Aly
is on bed rest.

00:27.395 --> 00:29.963
We brought you here today
to choose a godparent.

00:29.997 --> 00:32.366
Oh, yes! Sorry.
I'm sorry. Carry on.

00:32.400 --> 00:34.902
Now, on my side,
we have my entire network

00:34.935 --> 00:36.170
of good friends.
Friends so close,

00:36.204 --> 00:37.638
I consider them family.

00:37.671 --> 00:39.673
And on my side, we have Leslie.

00:39.707 --> 00:42.276
-I'm all she's got.
-Oh, boy.

00:42.310 --> 00:44.645
All right, everybody,
please line up in formation.

00:44.678 --> 00:46.814
Winston, I don't have time for
this. It's my first day back at

00:46.847 --> 00:49.750
Ass Strat tomorrow. I should be
moisturizing and making dreams.

00:49.783 --> 00:51.785
Schmidt, we didn't choose you.

00:51.819 --> 00:53.053
-You may face the wall.
-Dork!

00:53.087 --> 00:54.888
-Watch it.
-Cece,

00:54.922 --> 00:57.258
we didn't choose you either.
Reason being is your friendship

00:57.291 --> 01:00.228
is too important to ruin by
making you our baby's godmother.

01:00.261 --> 01:01.729
Mm-hmm. Why do I feel
like your lips are moving

01:01.762 --> 01:03.063
but Aly's doing the talking?

01:03.097 --> 01:04.932
(whispers):
Sorry.

01:04.965 --> 01:06.500
-Nick? -I got
a good feeling about this.

01:06.534 --> 01:07.501
Face the wall.

01:07.535 --> 01:09.002
Ooh. This ain't over.

01:11.605 --> 01:12.873
WINSTON:
Leslie,

01:12.906 --> 01:14.975
you may face the wall.

01:15.008 --> 01:18.246
-Ha-ha-ha! Suck it, bitch!
-Leslie,

01:18.279 --> 01:20.047
-you lost.
-(grunts)

01:20.080 --> 01:21.081
Leslie is confused.

01:21.115 --> 01:22.550
And now the moment of truth.

01:22.583 --> 01:24.818
Jessica Day,

01:24.852 --> 01:27.888
will you be
our baby's godmother?

01:27.921 --> 01:29.523
Yes, I will.

01:29.557 --> 01:31.825
Why is Leslie still dancing?

01:31.859 --> 01:32.993
Leslie.

01:33.026 --> 01:35.028
-Hey, now we're both godparents.
-What?

01:35.062 --> 01:37.231
Nick, for the hundredth time,
you are not Ruth's godfather.

01:37.265 --> 01:39.467
Yes, I am, for the hundred
and one time... first time.

01:39.500 --> 01:41.602
First of all, Jews and Hindus
do not have godparents.

01:41.635 --> 01:43.937
And even if we did,
we would not choose you.

01:43.971 --> 01:44.938
Ruth is not a fan.

01:44.972 --> 01:46.106
Ruth doesn't like me?

01:46.140 --> 01:48.242
She sees you more
as a dimwitted raccoon.

01:48.276 --> 01:50.110
-Well, my mind is blown.
This is a game changer. -Okay,

01:50.144 --> 01:51.111
everyone leave.

01:51.145 --> 01:52.780
Okay, that was a waste of time.

01:52.813 --> 01:54.415
We got a babysitter for this?

01:54.448 --> 01:56.016
Jess, can you stay back
for a moment?

01:56.049 --> 01:57.418
Yeah. You chose wisely.

01:57.451 --> 01:59.987
I will revolutionize
being a godparent.

02:00.020 --> 02:02.122
Your son will be
my Cinderell... o.

02:02.156 --> 02:04.725
We'll be reviewing
your performance weekly.

02:04.758 --> 02:06.126
You can be replaced.

02:06.160 --> 02:07.961
Heavy is the head
that holds the crown,

02:07.995 --> 02:11.532
but strong are the neck muscles
that hold up said head.

02:11.565 --> 02:12.533
Ooh.

02:14.835 --> 02:16.837
(door closes)

02:17.738 --> 02:18.706
Cigarette!

02:22.910 --> 02:25.078
-Well done.
-Well done.

02:25.112 --> 02:26.814
*

02:28.849 --> 02:31.619
Uh, before I move on to
the next slide, let me just say

02:31.652 --> 02:34.455
thank you for agreeing
to stay at home this week

02:34.488 --> 02:36.957
while I get back in the saddle
at work.

02:36.990 --> 02:39.627
Now, you need to pick up Ruth
at 2:00 p.m. on the dot.

02:39.660 --> 02:40.828
The three pillars of the pickup

02:40.861 --> 02:43.397
are gate code, sign out,
and lunch,

02:43.431 --> 02:44.898
which needs to be
a peanut butter sandwich,

02:44.932 --> 02:46.600
otherwise,
she will shut down and go

02:46.634 --> 02:48.101
-full armadillo.
-Yeah, I got it.

02:48.135 --> 02:50.137
-Pick her up, drop her off.
How hard can it be? -Well, first

02:50.170 --> 02:51.171
of all, you got it backwards.

02:51.205 --> 02:52.940
You drop off in the morning,

02:52.973 --> 02:55.142
you pick up in the after...
I'm sorry.

02:55.175 --> 02:57.144
I'm a little stressed out.
I know that I said

02:57.177 --> 02:59.247
that I would go back to work
when Ruth started school,

02:59.280 --> 03:01.749
which, look,
I'm-I'm excited about.

03:01.782 --> 03:03.116
But I've been out of the game
for a while,

03:03.150 --> 03:04.385
and I've become accustomed

03:04.418 --> 03:05.819
to a different type
of lifestyle.

03:05.853 --> 03:08.121
Daddy was gonna get
into that party no matter what,

03:08.155 --> 03:09.557
so I jumped over the hedge.

03:09.590 --> 03:11.359
Of course. It was Prince!

03:11.392 --> 03:12.960
You get it.

03:12.993 --> 03:15.663
We'll be fine. What you see
as a life-or-death mission,

03:15.696 --> 03:17.465
I see as a week off
with my daughter.

03:17.498 --> 03:19.467
(chuckles)
Wrong again. Buckle up.

03:21.569 --> 03:23.437
These should cover
your first four hours.

03:23.471 --> 03:25.773
Okay, I'm off.

03:25.806 --> 03:27.341
Yeah, you need to go. Okay?

03:27.375 --> 03:30.344
-Now get. -I'm excited. I shaved
my entire body last night.

03:30.378 --> 03:33.547
I feel like I could
ride the wind to work.

03:33.581 --> 03:36.984
And here comes a contraction.

03:37.017 --> 03:38.886
Thank you for filling in
for Aly.

03:38.919 --> 03:40.821
-Of course. I'm the godmother.
-And one, two,

03:40.854 --> 03:43.891
three, primal scream.

03:43.924 --> 03:47.160
(all screaming, shouting)

03:47.194 --> 03:50.531
Oh, my God!
That's a big hea... Sorry.

03:50.564 --> 03:51.732
INSTRUCTOR:
Okay, and now let's practice

03:51.765 --> 03:53.934
some pelvic tilts
on the birthing ball.

03:53.967 --> 03:55.102
Oh.

03:56.370 --> 03:57.938
WINSTON:
Excuse me. I-I realize you

03:57.971 --> 03:59.540
didn't get me one, so I'm gonna
go ahead and get my own.

03:59.573 --> 04:00.841
Uh...

04:00.874 --> 04:02.410
-Got the big boy. (chuckles)
-Yeah.

04:02.443 --> 04:05.413
Whew! You know what's crazy
is you're gonna be

04:05.446 --> 04:07.748
a father any day now.

04:07.781 --> 04:10.784
-Yeah, it kind of snuck up on
me. -Yeah, you better get ready,

04:10.818 --> 04:13.854
'cause you're gonna get on
the Dad Train soon. (chugging)

04:13.887 --> 04:15.623
Dad-dad!
(chugging)

04:15.656 --> 04:19.427
"No getting off this train."

04:19.460 --> 04:22.396
-You okay? -Oh, yeah,
I'm good. (chuckles) I'm good.

04:22.430 --> 04:25.232
Well, all right.

04:25.265 --> 04:26.634
Who would like to demonstrate
how to hold a baby?

04:26.667 --> 04:28.569
Any takers? What about you?

04:28.602 --> 04:30.404
Oh, not me.
That baby's creep city.

04:30.438 --> 04:31.772
(chuckles)
Winnie, you're up.

04:31.805 --> 04:33.607
Me? Oh. Yeah.

04:33.641 --> 04:35.242
-Let's go, Dad.
-Okay.

04:36.143 --> 04:37.778
Hold it like this?

04:37.811 --> 04:39.580
-Cradle the head.
-Cradle it. Yeah.

04:39.613 --> 04:41.982
(quietly):
Well, look at you.

04:42.015 --> 04:46.219
I promise to love
and protect you.

04:46.253 --> 04:47.788
Nobody's ever gonna hurt
my goochy, goochy...

04:47.821 --> 04:50.558
-Oh! Oh! I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. -Okay, and...

04:50.591 --> 04:53.126
I'm sorry. I'm gonna fix this.

04:53.160 --> 04:56.029
I'm gonna fix him.
I'm not ready.

04:56.063 --> 04:58.031
-No. -Here, put that back.
Put that back inside of you.

04:58.065 --> 04:59.166
I don't want no part of that.

04:59.199 --> 05:00.601
(shouting)

05:01.735 --> 05:03.337
(exhaling)

05:03.371 --> 05:07.274
Look at us,
the unbreakable Kim and Schmidt.

05:07.307 --> 05:09.276
God, I forgot
how much I despise you.

05:09.309 --> 05:11.412
We're gonna need your thoughts
on a new salsa account,

05:11.445 --> 05:14.314
-so get up to speed.
-Oh, I am up to speed on salsa.

05:14.348 --> 05:16.984
Now heads up, Schmidt,
things have changed here.

05:17.017 --> 05:18.819
-(elevator dings) -It's not
the same office you left.

05:20.020 --> 05:22.322
Ass Strat has been taken over

05:22.356 --> 05:24.758
by a Tokyo-based conglomerate.

05:28.829 --> 05:32.099
Are the toilets also Japa...

05:32.132 --> 05:33.434
Yes.

05:33.467 --> 05:35.436
(exhales)

05:35.469 --> 05:37.270
*

05:37.304 --> 05:39.773
(as Schmidt): "Cecilia, you're
playing your music too loud."

05:39.807 --> 05:41.675
What's that, babe?
Yeah, you know,

05:41.709 --> 05:43.444
I can't hear you out here
with...

05:43.477 --> 05:45.479
-Oh, my God! -NICK: What,
are we having a laundry party?

05:45.513 --> 05:47.047
-What is that?!
-This?

05:47.080 --> 05:49.383
It's just a bear
I found outside the loft.

05:49.417 --> 05:50.818
Yeah, I brought it
for my girl Ruth.

05:50.851 --> 05:52.686
Well, she's at school right now,
and I have

05:52.720 --> 05:54.955
15 binders worth of stuff to do
that Schmidt has left for me

05:54.988 --> 05:56.457
-before I go pick her up.
-Oh, that's perfect.

05:56.490 --> 05:58.492
I'll just pick her up.
I'll pick her up from school.

05:58.526 --> 06:01.395
I don't need your help picking
up my daughter from school.

06:01.429 --> 06:03.330
-Okay? -All right, well,
would you please tell her

06:03.363 --> 06:05.966
that I left this bear for her
so she knows it was from me?

06:05.999 --> 06:07.300
-Mm-mm.
-Ugh.

06:07.334 --> 06:09.036
-What?
-There's ants all over its neck.

06:09.069 --> 06:11.572
-What?
-Oh!

06:11.605 --> 06:13.474
There's more ants. Every time
it gets hit, more ants come out.

06:13.507 --> 06:15.142
Okay. All right.

06:15.175 --> 06:16.810
Hey, buddy.

06:16.844 --> 06:19.513
So, two things.
Um, first of all,

06:19.547 --> 06:21.314
we're not welcome back
in the class.

06:21.348 --> 06:24.452
And, second, they're billing you
for all ten classes.

06:24.485 --> 06:26.720
Jess, what if I'm not ready
to be a father?

06:26.754 --> 06:29.056
Winston, that was a fake baby.

06:29.089 --> 06:30.491
Real babies' heads

06:30.524 --> 06:32.125
-don't come off like that.
-Jess, I was

06:32.159 --> 06:34.528
in that class
and it made me realize

06:34.562 --> 06:36.964
that this baby is coming.

06:36.997 --> 06:38.666
What happens
when I'm in that hospital

06:38.699 --> 06:40.233
and I see my son's face
for the first time,

06:40.267 --> 06:42.369
coming out of Aly's butt?
What am I gonna do?

06:42.402 --> 06:43.837
What if there's something
that I don't know?

06:43.871 --> 06:46.173
I know this is gonna
sound crazy,

06:46.206 --> 06:47.908
but ever since I found out
Aly was pregnant,

06:47.941 --> 06:50.110
I keep thinking about my dad.

06:50.143 --> 06:51.812
That clown? He left you guys.

06:51.845 --> 06:53.647
I know.
It makes absolutely no sense,

06:53.681 --> 06:56.216
but I keep thinking,
what does he look like?

06:56.249 --> 06:58.351
You know?
Does he think about me?

06:58.385 --> 07:00.588
-Does he have a small group
of white friends like me? -Well,

07:00.621 --> 07:03.090
have you thought about, you
know, reaching out to him again?

07:03.123 --> 07:04.692
I keep thinking, in
a perfect world, I wouldn't have

07:04.725 --> 07:07.294
to track down my dad
and risk getting rejected.

07:07.327 --> 07:08.896
He would just...

07:08.929 --> 07:11.331
Magically show up.

07:11.364 --> 07:12.800
Exactly.

07:16.136 --> 07:20.007
-Sturdy.
-Hey, Winston!

07:20.040 --> 07:21.408
(chuckles)
Looking good.

07:21.441 --> 07:22.676
You don't have to
gas me up, Jess.

07:22.710 --> 07:23.911
I've been at this thing
for three hours.

07:23.944 --> 07:25.779
-It is all legs.
-Yeah.

07:25.813 --> 07:27.615
Look, I just wanted
to tell you something,

07:27.648 --> 07:30.450
and that is that
when you're alive...

07:30.484 --> 07:32.886
Sometimes your friends
think that you're... No.

07:32.920 --> 07:35.122
Okay, I'm just gonna say it.
Your dad's outside.

07:35.155 --> 07:36.490
(laughs)

07:36.524 --> 07:37.925
Okay, that's a weird joke.

07:37.958 --> 07:39.359
Yeah, that's not a joke.

07:39.392 --> 07:41.695
He is, um... he's outside.

07:41.729 --> 07:43.430
At this moment.

07:43.463 --> 07:45.566
(chuckles) Well, how the hell
did you find him?

07:45.599 --> 07:48.335
Well, it was a journey.
Basically, I Googled his name,

07:48.368 --> 07:50.771
and here we are.

07:50.804 --> 07:52.039
-Oh.
-Listen,

07:52.072 --> 07:53.941
if it would make you feel better
to talk to your dad,

07:53.974 --> 07:55.308
then I think you should.

07:55.342 --> 07:57.444
Yeah, I'll go talk to him.
I wonder if... (chuckles)

07:57.477 --> 07:58.879
Nah.

07:58.912 --> 08:00.280
Okay. "Hey, D... Hey, Pop.

08:00.313 --> 08:02.115
"You want to shake my...
You want to shake my...

08:02.149 --> 08:03.784
Your hand looks like my hand."
(laughs)

08:03.817 --> 08:05.619
He'll be like, "What's up, son?"

08:05.653 --> 08:06.920
I'll be like,
"Don't call me son."

08:06.954 --> 08:08.989
-Uh-huh.
-"Don't call me son." You know?

08:09.022 --> 08:10.658
"But I love you so much.
I miss...

08:10.691 --> 08:12.660
I've never seen you."
I don't know what he looks like.

08:12.693 --> 08:13.827
Or I can tell him to leave.

08:13.861 --> 08:15.763
No.

08:15.796 --> 08:17.197
No. It's fine.

08:17.230 --> 08:18.732
He's my dad.

08:18.766 --> 08:20.033
I'll tell him.

08:20.067 --> 08:22.369
(sighs)

08:29.209 --> 08:30.510
Say what you got to say, son.

08:32.546 --> 08:34.648
Daddy!

08:34.682 --> 08:35.983
(both laugh)

08:37.350 --> 08:38.819
-Get it out. Yeah.
-(crying): Oh, my... My God.

08:38.852 --> 08:39.920
-Look at that.
-Look at that.

08:39.953 --> 08:40.888
-Look at that!
-Look at that!

08:40.921 --> 08:42.890
Look at that!
Oh, come on, now.

08:42.923 --> 08:43.957
-Come on!
-Come on, now.

08:43.991 --> 08:44.958
Be feeling like
I'm-a stand up in here.

08:44.992 --> 08:46.560
-Come on, now!
-Come on, now.

08:46.594 --> 08:47.661
NICK:
Okay. Kids' toys.

08:47.695 --> 08:48.929
-I got this.
-(phone rings)

08:48.962 --> 08:50.931
Okay, I got that.

08:52.099 --> 08:53.500
Go for Nick.

08:53.533 --> 08:55.102
Uh, hey, Nick. Where are you?

08:55.135 --> 08:57.805
I'm at home making a goodie bag
for my favorite little girl.

08:57.838 --> 09:00.173
Um, listen to me.
Uh, I actually...

09:00.207 --> 09:02.710
(clears throat)
I need your...

09:02.743 --> 09:05.512
help picking up Ruth
from school.

09:05.545 --> 09:07.815
(laughs): Oh.
Isn't this interesting?

09:07.848 --> 09:09.116
Last time I checked,
you didn't need

09:09.149 --> 09:10.550
old Nick Miller's help.

09:10.584 --> 09:12.653
Hold a minute
while old Nick Miller laughs

09:12.686 --> 09:14.788
-and says, "Well, well, well."
-Nick.

09:14.822 --> 09:15.923
-Please. Okay, I...
-(laughing)

09:15.956 --> 09:17.490
Nick.

09:17.524 --> 09:19.226
-Listen to me...
-Well, well, well.

09:19.259 --> 09:21.494
-Looks like you do need
old Nicky's help. -(groans)

09:21.528 --> 09:22.963
-Please. Please. Listen to me.
-(laughs)

09:22.996 --> 09:24.397
Okay, Nick, I forgot

09:24.431 --> 09:26.533
my phone at the house,
and that phone

09:26.566 --> 09:29.069
-has the gate code that will let
me into the school... -Hold on.

09:29.102 --> 09:31.271
If you forgot your phone
at home,

09:31.304 --> 09:33.140
then tell me this:

09:33.173 --> 09:35.208
what are you calling me on?

09:35.242 --> 09:37.510
A stranger's phone, okay?

09:37.544 --> 09:39.012
Ruth's lunch

09:39.046 --> 09:40.413
is next to my phone,

09:40.447 --> 09:42.549
and I forgot her lunch, too,
so just bring both, okay?

09:42.582 --> 09:44.284
Got it. Also...

09:45.919 --> 09:47.054
Welcome back, Mr. Schmidt.

09:47.087 --> 09:48.255
I cannot wait

09:48.288 --> 09:50.223
to hear your pitch
on the salsa account.

09:50.257 --> 09:51.725
Uh, take it away.

09:51.759 --> 09:53.193
SCHMIDT:
I'd love to. Thank you so much.

09:53.226 --> 09:54.728
Let's talk about salsa.

09:54.762 --> 09:55.796
It's a sauce.

09:55.829 --> 09:56.930
-Or it...
-(phone vibrates)

09:56.964 --> 09:59.032
Uh...

10:00.133 --> 10:02.369
Uh, I actually
have to take this.

10:02.402 --> 10:04.204
So-so sorry.

10:05.272 --> 10:07.407
-Hello?
-Daddy, come pick me up.

10:07.440 --> 10:09.042
Mommy isn't here yet.

10:09.076 --> 10:10.477
What do you mean,
Mommy's not... It's 2:30.

10:10.510 --> 10:12.946
What is she do...?
(sighs)

10:15.883 --> 10:18.752
Okay, um...

10:18.786 --> 10:20.587
Daddy's on his way.

10:20.620 --> 10:22.790
(chuckles)

10:22.823 --> 10:25.392
I actually have to step out
for just a second.

10:25.425 --> 10:27.094
You know, in preparation
for this meeting,

10:27.127 --> 10:30.397
I ate an entire jar of salsa,
and it is...

10:30.430 --> 10:32.499
(whistles)
sliding right through me.

10:35.102 --> 10:37.671
Ah, come on.

10:38.839 --> 10:39.940
Hey, little girl.

10:39.973 --> 10:41.474
Hi.

10:41.508 --> 10:44.011
-You want to open the gate
for me? -No.

10:44.044 --> 10:45.879
No? You want...
Let me see what I got.

10:45.913 --> 10:47.047
A peanut butter sandwich?

10:47.080 --> 10:48.248
You want
a peanut butter sandwich?

10:48.281 --> 10:49.616
Come here me a sec.
Give me a sec.

10:49.649 --> 10:51.919
Look at this, look at this.

10:51.952 --> 10:53.687
Come over here,
eat the peanut butter sandwich.

10:53.721 --> 10:55.055
Open the gate. Look.

10:55.088 --> 10:57.590
Mmm. So yummy.

10:57.624 --> 10:59.159
Come... come on, come on.
Where you going?

10:59.192 --> 11:00.961
Hey! Little girl!

11:00.994 --> 11:02.763
Come on, little girl, please.

11:02.796 --> 11:05.465
-Where you going? Ah. No.
-MAN: Hey!

11:05.498 --> 11:07.167
-What are you doing? -Oh, I was
just trying to get a little girl

11:07.200 --> 11:08.168
out of here. Ah.

11:08.201 --> 11:09.903
I want to be a girl's godfather.

11:09.937 --> 11:11.638
So, godfathers
can basically make rules

11:11.671 --> 11:12.873
and do things with little kids

11:12.906 --> 11:14.007
when their parents
aren't around.

11:14.041 --> 11:15.575
-What? Excuse me?!
-And also, they love me.

11:15.608 --> 11:17.144
-You sick bastard.
-No, no.

11:17.177 --> 11:18.812
-You're coming with me. Peanut
butter sandwich. -No, no, ah!

11:18.846 --> 11:20.613
-Disgusting.
-Stop! Kids love me.

11:20.647 --> 11:21.614
I'm a famous author.

11:21.648 --> 11:23.150
Hey, he's with me. I'm a parent.

11:23.183 --> 11:24.284
-Parent.
-Yeah.

11:24.317 --> 11:25.652
No worries.
I'm, uh, I'm a parent.

11:25.685 --> 11:26.954
Okay, so what's
the gate code, then?

11:26.987 --> 11:29.622
Gate code is four...

11:29.656 --> 11:32.392
-three... seven...
-You're guessing.

11:32.425 --> 11:34.494
-He's onto us, Cece! Run! Hyah!
-Hey.

11:34.527 --> 11:35.695
I'm coming for you, Ruth!

11:35.729 --> 11:37.530
Here comes your godfather!

11:37.564 --> 11:38.631
Oh, my God.

11:38.665 --> 11:40.768
Is that it?

11:40.801 --> 11:42.169
-Wait, hold up, hold on now.
-H-Hold up.

11:42.202 --> 11:43.837
-Hold up, boy.
-You got bees on your shirt.

11:43.871 --> 11:46.306
-I got birds on my shirt.
-Birds and the bees, baby.

11:46.339 --> 11:48.308
-Birds and the bees! (laughs)
-Come on, now.

11:48.341 --> 11:49.977
-My boy!
-(both laughing)

11:51.211 --> 11:52.645
Hey, Aly.

11:52.679 --> 11:54.214
-What are you doing out of bed?
-I heard

11:54.247 --> 11:56.016
a man's voice and wanted to know
if you were cheating

11:56.049 --> 11:58.318
-on Nick in the bedroom
of my future child. -(chuckles)

11:58.351 --> 12:01.388
Well, big news:
I found Winston's dad.

12:01.421 --> 12:03.556
-In there.
-(Winston and Van laughing)

12:04.758 --> 12:06.226
-(giggles)
-You want to wrestle?

12:06.259 --> 12:07.494
WINSTON:
Take off your pants, Dad!

12:07.527 --> 12:08.495
-You know what we like?
-MAN: What?

12:08.528 --> 12:09.496
WINSTON:
Those two black dudes

12:09.529 --> 12:10.497
from This Is Us.

12:10.530 --> 12:13.066
That's not Winston's dad.

12:13.100 --> 12:15.435
-(excited chatter continues)
-What?

12:15.468 --> 12:16.703
I saw his picture
on the database

12:16.736 --> 12:17.805
at the station. I know this.

12:17.838 --> 12:18.872
That's not him!

12:18.906 --> 12:19.907
Huh.

12:22.709 --> 12:24.577
Jess, who is that man
in my house

12:24.611 --> 12:26.646
pretending to be Winston's dad?

12:26.679 --> 12:28.081
His name is Van Bishop.

12:28.115 --> 12:29.883
But did he say
he was Winston's dad?

12:29.917 --> 12:31.684
I showed him
a picture of Winston,

12:31.718 --> 12:33.553
and he burst into tears.

12:33.586 --> 12:35.789
-So no.
-I'm sorry.

12:35.823 --> 12:37.157
Winston was freaking out

12:37.190 --> 12:38.826
about being a father
and kept saying

12:38.859 --> 12:40.427
he wished he could meet his dad.

12:40.460 --> 12:42.029
WINSTON: Of course
you can sleep over, Dad.

12:42.062 --> 12:43.096
-The couch lets out.
-(Van laughs)

12:43.130 --> 12:44.932
Love you, son.

12:44.965 --> 12:46.566
-I love you, too, Pop.
-Mm-mm. This is bad.

12:46.599 --> 12:48.235
They are getting closer
every minute.

12:48.268 --> 12:50.037
You need to fix this right now.

12:50.070 --> 12:52.239
Okay, Aly, I got this.

12:52.272 --> 12:54.407
If you don't,
when I have the strength

12:54.441 --> 12:57.077
to wrap these hands
around your tiny little neck,

12:57.110 --> 12:58.411
I will do so.

12:58.445 --> 12:59.412
(chuckles nervously)

12:59.446 --> 13:00.480
And I will smile.

13:01.949 --> 13:03.316
(Cece sighs)

13:03.350 --> 13:05.052
-This is all your fault.
-This is all your fault.

13:05.085 --> 13:06.219
-Don't talk to me, okay?
-No, don't talk to me.

13:06.253 --> 13:07.520
Now you're just gonna sit there
and mimic me?

13:07.554 --> 13:08.488
Don't do the thing
with the hands.

13:08.521 --> 13:10.123
-Grow up!
-You grow up!

13:10.157 --> 13:11.458
-Are you kidding me right now?
-Are you kidding me?

13:11.491 --> 13:12.725
-Don't talk to me.
-Don't do the Cece to me.

13:12.759 --> 13:13.760
(deep voice):
Don't do the Nick to me.

13:13.793 --> 13:15.362
-Mommy!
-(gasps)

13:15.395 --> 13:17.464
-Hey. -Hey!
-Uncle Nick.

13:17.497 --> 13:18.631
Hi, honey.

13:18.665 --> 13:20.033
I am so sorry.

13:20.067 --> 13:21.234
You must be hungry. Right?

13:21.268 --> 13:23.136
No worries, 'cause Uncle Nick

13:23.170 --> 13:24.804
-has your sandwich.
-I do. I have your sandwich.

13:24.838 --> 13:27.440
Here you go.

13:27.474 --> 13:29.476
You ate it.

13:29.509 --> 13:31.144
The truth is I sat on it.
(chuckles)

13:31.178 --> 13:32.445
Maybe I took a bite.
I took a couple bites.

13:32.479 --> 13:35.282
-I ate a lot of it.
-You know what? It gonna be...

13:35.315 --> 13:36.583
Oh, no.
No, no, no, no, no, no.

13:36.616 --> 13:37.918
She is going full armadillo.

13:37.951 --> 13:40.120
-(grunts) -I need my phone.
Give me my phone.

13:40.153 --> 13:41.321
Well, I'm her godfather.

13:41.354 --> 13:42.589
-I'm not a fisherman's vest.
-No.

13:42.622 --> 13:44.057
What you are
is the human equivalent

13:44.091 --> 13:45.725
of the crack
between two couch cushions.

13:45.758 --> 13:46.759
Grab her.
I'm gonna go start the car.

13:46.793 --> 13:48.195
VAN:
So, anyway,

13:48.228 --> 13:50.063
-I'm on the back of a Jet Ski
with Cornel West. -Mm-hmm.

13:50.097 --> 13:52.966
And he tells me, "Hey, you're
leaning too far to the left."

13:53.000 --> 13:54.601
I said, "No, you leaning
too far to the left."

13:54.634 --> 13:55.768
-Oh!
-(both laugh)

13:55.802 --> 13:57.704
I see what you did. I see it.

13:57.737 --> 13:59.406
Y'all talking about Cornel West?

13:59.439 --> 14:01.074
-Dad's got stories for days.
-I bet.

14:01.108 --> 14:03.643
I bet. Anyway,
why don't we button mash this

14:03.676 --> 14:05.612
for next week and, um, Van,
I can give you a ride home.

14:05.645 --> 14:06.779
-(laughs)
-Wait, what? No.

14:06.813 --> 14:08.681
-No, no, no, no.
He just got here. -Ah.

14:08.715 --> 14:10.951
You know, I want to talk
about the old days in Chicago.

14:10.984 --> 14:11.985
Never been there. Garbage city.

14:12.019 --> 14:13.853
Yeah, it has its bad parts,

14:13.887 --> 14:16.489
but, you know, the education
system is getting...

14:16.523 --> 14:18.825
-Wait. You've never been there?
-Never been there.

14:18.858 --> 14:20.293
You know what?
I totally know what he means,

14:20.327 --> 14:21.694
because I feel like sometimes

14:21.728 --> 14:23.796
I've never been to L.A.,
and I live here.

14:23.830 --> 14:25.865
You know what I mean?
Like, ask me where the ocean is.

14:25.899 --> 14:27.334
"Uh, to the left?"
I don't know.

14:27.367 --> 14:28.768
-Should we hit the road?
-WINSTON: Jess?

14:28.801 --> 14:30.603
What's going on?

14:33.873 --> 14:35.575
Oh, no.
Ruth hasn't been signed out.

14:35.608 --> 14:38.011
Um, excuse me.
Um, have you seen Ruth?

14:38.045 --> 14:41.648
Brown hair, smile that would
shake the earth, hates peas?

14:41.681 --> 14:43.383
A white man broke in today.

14:43.416 --> 14:45.718
A... a white man?! No!

14:45.752 --> 14:47.820
Well, what did security do
about it?!

14:47.854 --> 14:50.323
-Nothing.
-Typical!

14:50.357 --> 14:51.724
I'm calling Cece.

14:51.758 --> 14:55.028
(phone ringing)

14:55.062 --> 14:57.464
Go for Brian.

14:57.497 --> 14:59.967
Who the heck is Brian?!
Where's Cece?!

15:01.034 --> 15:02.802
All right, Ruth,

15:02.835 --> 15:04.904
let's find something
to play with inside this, uh,

15:04.938 --> 15:07.507
pillowcase of crap your future
godfather brought you.

15:07.540 --> 15:10.277
-Oh, God. Okay.
-There's this thing.

15:10.310 --> 15:12.845
-Put that down. -Yeah,
put that down right there.

15:12.879 --> 15:14.747
Look at this!
We got an old beeper.

15:14.781 --> 15:16.716
You can pretend
to be a-a doctor,

15:16.749 --> 15:18.751
or a late '90s drug dealer.

15:18.785 --> 15:20.920
-What's a drug dealer?
-Don't give her that.

15:20.954 --> 15:22.489
Gah, Ma,
stop being such a narc.

15:22.522 --> 15:24.057
(sighs)

15:24.091 --> 15:26.059
Okay, thank God you're alive.

15:26.093 --> 15:27.527
Of course we're alive.
What are you doing here?

15:27.560 --> 15:28.928
I went to the school;
Ruth wasn't there.

15:28.962 --> 15:30.563
They told me a white man
tried to hop the fence,

15:30.597 --> 15:33.266
and some man named Brian
answered your phone.

15:33.300 --> 15:35.068
-Hi.
-What happened?

15:35.102 --> 15:37.004
-Nick ate her sandwich.
-I had one bite of her sandwich.

15:37.037 --> 15:38.771
Guess, technically,
"inhaled" it.

15:38.805 --> 15:40.707
-I didn't inhale it!
-Guys, please.

15:40.740 --> 15:42.875
It's not a big deal.
I'll make her another sandwich.

15:42.909 --> 15:44.744
No, you won't.

15:44.777 --> 15:47.747
About that. So...
(laughs)

15:49.582 --> 15:50.950
We're out of peanut butter.

15:50.984 --> 15:52.585
What do you mean,
we're out of peanut butter?

15:52.619 --> 15:54.921
CECE: I know. Okay,
there was just too much to do.

15:54.954 --> 15:57.724
-And those binders. It is not
possible! -I do this every day.

15:57.757 --> 15:59.592
NICK: You see, that's when
the-the Chicago Cubs won the

15:59.626 --> 16:01.894
World Series, and, uh, all the
players signed it. I need you

16:01.928 --> 16:04.297
to just be careful, 'cause
it's worth a lot of money.

16:04.331 --> 16:06.566
I wouldn't do that.
I wouldn't do that.

16:06.599 --> 16:08.435
I wouldn't do that.
I wouldn't...

16:08.468 --> 16:11.271
-Did Nick fix our child?
-What are you doing?

16:11.304 --> 16:13.806
-Just making it pretty.
-You're ruining it.

16:13.840 --> 16:15.875
Your face ruined it!
You're a dumb raccoon.

16:15.908 --> 16:19.046
-Accurate. -Oh. As a godfather,
I got to push through that.

16:19.079 --> 16:20.947
-(phone rings)
-Ooh, that's work.

16:20.980 --> 16:24.217
-I got to go back.
-What about spa time?

16:24.251 --> 16:26.919
I need to zap my frown lines.

16:26.953 --> 16:29.622
Oh. Uh, honey.

16:29.656 --> 16:31.924
You know what, honey?

16:31.958 --> 16:35.262
We can do pretend Botox
on another day, okay?

16:35.295 --> 16:37.330
Why?

16:37.364 --> 16:39.299
Because Daddy has to go sell

16:39.332 --> 16:41.434
a Mexican product to Americans

16:41.468 --> 16:43.103
so that Japanese people

16:43.136 --> 16:44.504
can make money.

16:44.537 --> 16:46.639
I'm sorry.

16:46.673 --> 16:49.342
-Bye.
-Bye.

16:53.313 --> 16:55.482
-Jess, is he not my dad?
-Is he not my son?

16:55.515 --> 16:57.317
Before I answer that,
I want you guys to know

16:57.350 --> 16:59.619
I had an accomplice in this,
and her name is Google.

16:59.652 --> 17:00.820
Maybe I'm a little
confused here.

17:00.853 --> 17:02.355
I called you "Dad,"
you called me "son"

17:02.389 --> 17:04.023
for hours.
I sat on your lap.

17:04.057 --> 17:05.492
(whispers):
We ate pistachios together.

17:05.525 --> 17:07.860
I love pistachios.
She told me

17:07.894 --> 17:09.629
that you were my son,
and I believed her.

17:09.662 --> 17:12.332
I mean, you could be.
The '80s were a blur.

17:12.365 --> 17:14.934
And I toured the country
in a Van Morrison cover band.

17:14.967 --> 17:16.669
You did? Did you play
the Portland Rec Center?

17:16.703 --> 17:19.572
Oh, maybe. (laughs)
It was a wild time back then.

17:19.606 --> 17:21.641
(Van chuckles, sighs)

17:21.674 --> 17:24.677
* Hide behind a rainbow wall *

17:24.711 --> 17:27.980
* Slipping and sliding
all along *

17:28.014 --> 17:30.717
* The waterfall with you *

17:30.750 --> 17:32.652
* My brown-eyed girl *

17:32.685 --> 17:34.654
* You are my *

17:34.687 --> 17:35.988
BOTH:
* Brown-eyed girl. *

17:36.022 --> 17:38.858
I can't, I can't, uh...
I-I got to go.

17:38.891 --> 17:40.660
I can't,
I can't be here right now.

17:40.693 --> 17:42.395
(grunting)

17:42.429 --> 17:43.763
Oh!

17:43.796 --> 17:45.232
-Oh.
-Ooh!

17:45.265 --> 17:46.666
(groaning)

17:46.699 --> 17:49.569
* Brown-eyed girl. *

17:51.571 --> 17:54.541
Mr. Yukimura, uh, I apologize.

17:54.574 --> 17:56.543
-Sell me some salsa.
-Okay, here we go.

17:56.576 --> 17:58.411
Well, what do we know
about salsa?

17:58.445 --> 18:00.880
-We know that it's a gift...
-(phone chirping)

18:00.913 --> 18:02.882
from another culture.

18:02.915 --> 18:04.484
(phone continues chirping)

18:07.654 --> 18:09.389
Schmidt?!
(hisses)

18:10.457 --> 18:12.925
Are you with us?

18:12.959 --> 18:16.829
Yes. Uh, it's just...

18:18.631 --> 18:21.434
You don't know how important
salsa is until it's gone.

18:21.468 --> 18:24.604
You keep it in the back of
your fridge, taking for granted

18:24.637 --> 18:26.206
that it'll be there.

18:26.239 --> 18:27.607
But once it's gone,

18:27.640 --> 18:30.277
you realize you can't go
a single day without it.

18:30.310 --> 18:34.447
Señor Cha Cha's Salsa:

18:34.481 --> 18:37.284
the salsa that belongs
in the front of your fridge.

18:39.819 --> 18:42.622
Sure. Throw in a dragon
with a sombrero and I'm in.

18:42.655 --> 18:44.257
Great job.

18:44.291 --> 18:46.726
Moshi moshi.

18:46.759 --> 18:49.128
Hi, Mama Bear and Papa Bear.

18:49.162 --> 18:52.365
(laughs) Goldilocks is here
with an apology,

18:52.399 --> 18:55.101
-and it's gonna be just right.
-WINSTON: Aly?

18:55.134 --> 18:57.270
-Uh-huh. -Will you please
tell Jess to leave?

18:57.304 --> 18:58.805
You're not gonna talk to her?

18:58.838 --> 19:01.107
It's okay. Winston can
talk to me when he's ready.

19:01.140 --> 19:03.510
Baby, she didn't do it
on purpose.

19:03.543 --> 19:07.480
It's not her fault that she has
zero detective skills,

19:07.514 --> 19:09.582
and there's another Van Bishop
in Los Angeles.

19:09.616 --> 19:11.384
Which is crazy.

19:11.418 --> 19:13.320
-Her heart was in
the right place. -It was, and

19:13.353 --> 19:16.623
should I have let a strange man
in the house? No!

19:16.656 --> 19:19.626
Will it take a very long time
for you to forgive me?

19:19.659 --> 19:21.328
Yes. Years.

19:21.361 --> 19:22.662
(scoffs)

19:24.464 --> 19:26.299
Okay. I get it.

19:26.333 --> 19:27.834
I'll go. Um...

19:30.803 --> 19:34.874
I think this
belongs to Leslie now.

19:39.979 --> 19:43.850
For what it's worth, you are
more prepared to be a father

19:43.883 --> 19:45.852
than anyone I know,
and that includes Schmidt.

19:45.885 --> 19:49.389
And look, you'll have
good days and bad days.

19:49.422 --> 19:51.591
But you'll never be alone.

19:51.624 --> 19:54.927
And just remember,
you don't have to have had a dad

19:54.961 --> 19:56.729
to be a great dad.

20:00.833 --> 20:02.101
(Winston sighs)

20:02.134 --> 20:04.537
*

20:04.571 --> 20:05.972
Here.

20:07.073 --> 20:10.277
Thank you.
I won't let you down.

20:10.310 --> 20:11.878
And you know
what your mom looks like,

20:11.911 --> 20:14.547
-so I'm never gonna present you
with a fake mom... -Mm.

20:14.581 --> 20:17.049
-I'll stop. -Too soon.
-(laughs) Hey, family,

20:17.083 --> 20:19.319
I've been sitting on the curb
the last two hours, thinking.

20:19.352 --> 20:21.120
Look, I know
I'm not your real dad,

20:21.153 --> 20:22.789
but a part of me wishes I was.

20:22.822 --> 20:24.491
You know,
you're a hell of a kid.

20:24.524 --> 20:27.093
So if you ever need somebody
to play catch with you,

20:27.126 --> 20:28.561
or give you the real deal

20:28.595 --> 20:31.063
when you step out of line,
give me a call.

20:31.097 --> 20:33.032
Nah, dawg. I'm good.

20:33.065 --> 20:34.967
That makes sense.

20:35.001 --> 20:37.203
* And you *

20:38.938 --> 20:41.508
* I'm your brown-eyed girl *

20:41.541 --> 20:43.876
-Okay.
-Okay.

20:43.910 --> 20:47.013
-(sighs)
-Am I still wearing makeup?

20:47.046 --> 20:50.016
You look like my grandmother
right before she went insane.

20:50.049 --> 20:51.384
Good, great.

20:51.418 --> 20:52.619
* Tuesdays and so slow... *

20:52.652 --> 20:54.687
I'm sorry I went overboard
with the binders before.

20:54.721 --> 20:56.523
No, no. I'm sorry.

20:56.556 --> 21:00.427
I honestly don't know how
you do this every single day.

21:00.460 --> 21:01.728
How was work?

21:01.761 --> 21:03.763
-Frickin' crushed it.
-Oh, great.

21:03.796 --> 21:06.198
-And I think I want to quit.
-What? Really?

21:06.232 --> 21:09.869
I just kept wishing that I was
here, taking care of Ruth.

21:09.902 --> 21:11.604
It's the best job
I've ever had.

21:11.638 --> 21:16.376
What would you think if...
I was home full-time?

21:16.409 --> 21:21.080
I think that anything
that makes you happy

21:21.113 --> 21:23.716
and keeps those binders
away from me,

21:23.750 --> 21:25.785
that's what you should do.

21:25.818 --> 21:30.056
* La dee dah. *

21:30.089 --> 21:31.558
Aah!

21:31.591 --> 21:33.726
-What is that?! Bear!
-Yeah.

21:37.129 --> 21:39.766
And stay out!

21:39.799 --> 21:41.334
You bear!

21:43.202 --> 21:45.271
(tense music plays)

21:45.304 --> 21:48.475
It's all clear, honey!
I got rid of him!

Now that you're
done hanging
with New Girl,

21:59.652 --> 22:01.654
here are a few more shows
to check out from Fox.

22:03.756 --> 22:06.258
