WEBVTT

00:07.675 --> 00:09.677
( piano playing )

00:11.879 --> 00:13.414
( chuckles )

00:19.153 --> 00:20.654
WILL YOU TWO SLOW DOWN?

00:20.754 --> 00:22.723
YOU'RE EATING
LIKE THEY'RE GOING TO
TAKE IT AWAY FROM YOU.

00:22.823 --> 00:23.957
( mouth full )
I'M A GROWING GIRL.

00:24.058 --> 00:25.959
( laughs )

00:26.060 --> 00:28.829
IT'S SUCH A PLEASURE
SEEING YOU AND...

00:28.929 --> 00:30.698
SEEING HOW WELL
WORK IS GOING.

00:30.798 --> 00:32.333
WORK'S GOING
REALLY WELL, YEAH.

00:32.433 --> 00:33.901
MY BOSS SAID THAT
HE WANTS TO SEE MY BOOK

00:34.001 --> 00:35.002
WHEN IT'S DONE,
WHICH IS REALLY EXCITING.

00:35.103 --> 00:37.071
WHERE ARE YOU AT
WITH THAT?

00:37.171 --> 00:39.340
OH, WELL, I'VE DONE FOUR
OF THE ESSAYS,

00:39.440 --> 00:40.941
AND I'M JUST KIND
OF POLISHING THEM UP.

00:41.041 --> 00:42.510
AND MY HOPE IS THAT
IT'S GOING TO BE NINE.

00:42.610 --> 00:44.612
BUT, YOU KNOW, IT'S A MEMOIR.
SO-- HAVE TO LIVE THEM FIRST.

00:44.712 --> 00:47.648
( mother chuckles )
TIM, I DON'T WANT TO
JUST LEAVE IT

00:47.748 --> 00:48.949
TILL THE END
OF DINNER.

00:49.049 --> 00:51.552
I HEAR THAT. UM...

00:53.487 --> 00:55.623
HANNAH, YOUR MOTHER
AND I HAVE BEEN...

00:55.723 --> 00:58.559
TALKING, AND WE FEEL
THAT IT MAY BE TIME--

00:58.659 --> 01:00.361
HOW CAN I PHRASE THIS?

01:00.461 --> 01:02.796
WELL, WE SEE HOW WELL
YOU'RE DOING AT WORK.

01:02.896 --> 01:05.366
AND YOU REALLY SEEM
TO BE FIGURING OUT WHAT
IT IS THAT YOU WANT.

01:05.465 --> 01:09.237
BUT IT MAY BE TIME
FOR ONE FINAL PUSH.

01:09.337 --> 01:11.605
WHAT IS A "FINAL PUSH"?

01:11.705 --> 01:13.807
WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE
SUPPORTING YOU ANY LONGER.

01:13.907 --> 01:15.476
YOU SEE, I WASN'T GOING TO
PHRASE IT LIKE THAT, LOREEN,

01:15.576 --> 01:17.778
- THE WAY YOU PHRASED IT.
- BUT I HAVE NO JOB.

01:17.878 --> 01:21.048
NO, YOU HAVE AN INTERNSHIP
THAT YOU SAY IS GOING
TO TURN INTO A JOB.

01:21.149 --> 01:22.483
I DON'T KNOW WHEN.

01:22.583 --> 01:24.818
YOU GRADUATED FROM
COLLEGE TWO YEARS AGO.

01:24.918 --> 01:27.788
WE'VE BEEN SUPPORTING YOU FOR
TWO YEARS, AND THAT'S ENOUGH.

01:30.158 --> 01:31.692
DO YOU KNOW HOW CRAZY
THE ECONOMY IS RIGHT NOW?

01:31.792 --> 01:33.627
I MEAN, ALL MY FRIENDS
GET HELP FROM THEIR PARENTS.

01:33.727 --> 01:35.796
WE ARE SYMPATHETIC
TO THAT.

01:35.896 --> 01:38.031
BUT I'M YOUR ONLY CHILD,

01:38.132 --> 01:39.833
IT'S NOT LIKE I'M DRAINING
ALL YOUR RESOURCES.

01:39.933 --> 01:41.402
I MEAN, THIS FEELS
VERY ARBITRARY.

01:41.502 --> 01:43.471
YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT OUR FINANCES.

01:43.571 --> 01:47.141
WE'RE PROFESSORS, HANNAH.
PROFESSORS.

01:47.241 --> 01:50.178
WE CAN'T KEEP BANKROLLING
YOUR GROOVY LIFESTYLE.

01:50.278 --> 01:52.546
MY "GROOVY" LIFESTYLE?

01:52.646 --> 01:54.915
THE BILLS ADD UP.
WE'RE COVERING YOUR RENT,

01:55.015 --> 01:56.717
YOUR INSURANCE,
YOUR CELL PHONE.

01:56.817 --> 01:59.520
YOU SAID IT WAS CHEAPER
FOR YOU IF I WAS ON
THE FAMILY PLAN.

01:59.620 --> 02:01.289
YEAH.

02:01.389 --> 02:02.723
MAY I GET YOU MORE
OF ANYTHING?

02:02.823 --> 02:04.792
- UH--
- NO, SHE'S FINE.

02:06.126 --> 02:07.828
- DELICIOUS.
- YEAH.

02:09.697 --> 02:11.064
THIS IS NUTS.

02:11.165 --> 02:13.301
TED, CAN YOU HELP ME HERE?

02:13.401 --> 02:16.204
I COULD BE A DRUG ADDICT.
DO YOU REALIZE HOW LUCKY
YOU ARE?

02:16.304 --> 02:17.538
I MEAN, IT DOESN'T HAVE
TO BE HEROIN,

02:17.638 --> 02:19.573
IT COULD BE SOMETHING MORE
INSIDIOUS, LIKE PILLS.

02:19.673 --> 02:22.410
WHICH ARE LEGAL,
AND WHICH A LOT OF KIDS
DO, ALL THE TIME.

02:22.510 --> 02:25.813
AND THEN SLOWLY THEY
BECOME TOTALLY USELESS.

02:25.913 --> 02:28.382
THEY SEEM REALLY
HIGH-FUNCTIONING,
AND THEN IT JUST RUINS THEM.

02:28.482 --> 02:30.984
OKAY, MY FRIEND
SOPHIE, HER PARENTS
DON'T SUPPORT HER.

02:31.084 --> 02:33.020
LAST SUMMER, SHE HAD
TWO ABORTIONS

02:33.120 --> 02:35.356
RIGHT IN A ROW,
AND NO ONE CAME WITH HER.

02:35.456 --> 02:37.491
WHAT DOES THAT HAVE
TO DO WITH ANYTHING?

02:37.591 --> 02:40.861
I'M JUST SAYING THAT I AM SO
CLOSE TO THE LIFE THAT I WANT,

02:40.961 --> 02:42.230
THE LIFE THAT YOU
WANT FOR ME,

02:42.330 --> 02:43.897
FOR YOU TO JUST END
THAT RIGHT NOW?

02:43.997 --> 02:47.535
NO MORE MONEY.

02:49.002 --> 02:51.138
- STARTING WHEN?
- STARTING NOW.

02:51.239 --> 02:53.407
WE CAN TALK ABOUT
IT TOMORROW.

02:53.507 --> 02:54.608
I DON'T WANT TO
SEE YOU TOMORROW.

02:54.708 --> 02:56.510
- WHAT?
- BUT WE FLY OUT TUESDAY.

02:56.610 --> 02:59.847
I HAVE WORK, AND THEN
I HAVE A DINNER THING,

02:59.947 --> 03:01.349
AND THEN I AM BUSY

03:01.449 --> 03:04.585
TRYING TO BECOME WHO I AM.

03:15.162 --> 03:18.566
( music playing )

03:31.945 --> 03:34.348
( alarm beeping )

03:35.349 --> 03:37.751
- ALARM, ALARM.
- ( groaning )

03:46.394 --> 03:47.895
- WHERE IS IT?
- I DON'T KNOW.

03:56.003 --> 03:59.273
Driver:
MISS? YOU ARE HERE.

04:00.107 --> 04:02.343
ALREADY?

04:08.716 --> 04:11.084
Girl:
GOOD MORNING, CHARLIE.

04:11.184 --> 04:12.486
WHY DIDN'T YOU WAKE ME UP?

04:12.586 --> 04:14.322
I DIDN'T MEAN TO SLEEP
WITH HANNAH.

04:14.422 --> 04:16.189
Charlie:
BECAUSE YOU TWO
LOOKED SO ANGELIC.

04:16.290 --> 04:18.659
HMM, VICTORIA'S SECRET ANGEL,
FAT BABY ANGEL.

04:18.759 --> 04:22.029
- DON'T SAY THAT.
- NO WAY, YOU LOOK
AWESOME THESE DAYS.

04:22.129 --> 04:24.598
PLEASE AVERT YOUR EYES.

04:24.698 --> 04:26.266
OH...

04:26.367 --> 04:28.201
IS THAT A PRESENT?

04:28.302 --> 04:29.670
IS THAT FOR ME?

04:29.770 --> 04:32.573
- UH-OH. GIVE IT HERE.
- THANK YOU.

04:32.673 --> 04:35.776
YOU GUYS FELL ASLEEP
TO MARY TYLER MOORE
AGAIN, HUH?

04:35.876 --> 04:37.578
YES, GUILTY.

04:37.678 --> 04:39.747
IT'S A VERY ODD SHOW
TO HEAR THROUGH A WALL.

04:39.847 --> 04:41.615
COMING AT YA.

04:41.715 --> 04:42.950
HERE IT COMES.

04:43.050 --> 04:45.085
POW!

04:45.185 --> 04:48.055
I JUST BLEW UP
A KISS ON YOU.

04:48.155 --> 04:50.858
- ARE YOU GOING TO
LEAVE YOUR TOWEL ON?
- ( chuckles ) YES.

04:50.958 --> 04:53.461
BUT I NEVER SEE YOU NAKED,
AND YOU ALWAYS SEE ME NAKED.

04:53.561 --> 04:55.028
WHEN IT SHOULD ACTUALLY
BE THE OTHER WAY AROUND.

04:55.128 --> 04:57.465
- YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL, SHUT UP.
- I DON'T NEED THAT.

04:57.565 --> 04:59.633
- I NEED TO SEE YOUR BOOBS.
- WELL, YOU DON'T GET TO, SORRY.

04:59.733 --> 05:01.569
I ONLY SHOW MY BOOBS TO PEOPLE
I'M HAVING SEX WITH.

05:01.669 --> 05:03.971
YOU LITERALLY SLEPT
IN MY BED TO AVOID HIM.

05:04.071 --> 05:05.606
I KNOW.

05:05.706 --> 05:07.975
HE AND I HAVE
TURNED A CORNER.

05:08.075 --> 05:09.943
HIS TOUCH NOW FEELS LIKE

05:10.043 --> 05:13.180
A WEIRD UNCLE
JUST PUTTING HIS HAND ON
MY KNEE AT THANKSGIVING.

05:13.280 --> 05:14.648
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?

05:14.748 --> 05:17.351
- I THINK I HAVE TO END IT.
- YOU CAN'T DO THAT.

05:17.451 --> 05:18.886
I HAVE TO.
WHY NOT?

05:18.986 --> 05:20.954
'CAUSE HE'LL STAND OUTSIDE
OUR WINDOW WITH A BOOM BOX

05:21.054 --> 05:23.290
- OR HE'LL KILL HIMSELF.
- STOP.

05:23.391 --> 05:25.025
HEY, BABE.
OH, WHOA.

05:25.125 --> 05:26.827
SORRY. I THOUGHT IT WAS
JUST MY GIRLFRIEND IN HERE.

05:26.927 --> 05:28.796
DUDE, IT'S NEVER JUST
YOUR GIRLFRIEND IN HERE.

05:28.896 --> 05:29.963
I'M JUST SAYING GOODBYE.

05:30.063 --> 05:32.199
I'LL SEE YOU LADIES TONIGHT,
AND I'LL PICK UP WINE.

05:32.299 --> 05:34.134
OKAY, BIG KISSES.

05:34.234 --> 05:35.703
BYE.

05:35.803 --> 05:38.472
WHAT DOES IT EVEN FEEL LIKE
TO BE LOVED THAT MUCH?

05:38.572 --> 05:40.541
I DON'T KNOW.
I CAN'T FEEL IT ANYMORE.

05:40.641 --> 05:42.075
( chuckling )
OH, NO.

05:42.175 --> 05:43.544
I KNOW, I JUST--

05:43.644 --> 05:45.546
AND IT MAKES ME FEEL
LIKE SUCH A BITCH

05:45.646 --> 05:47.381
'CAUSE I CAN FEEL HIM
BEING SO NICE TO ME.

05:47.481 --> 05:50.283
AND YET IT MAKES
ME SO ANGRY.

05:50.384 --> 05:51.652
I THINK YOU NEED TO ADMIT
SOMETHING TO YOURSELF,

05:51.752 --> 05:53.621
WHICH IS THAT YOU'RE SICK
OF EATING HIM OUT.

05:53.721 --> 05:56.657
- EW.
- 'CAUSE HE HAS A VAGINA.

06:07.701 --> 06:10.638
- HI. CA VA?
- BONJOUR, ROOMIE.

06:10.738 --> 06:12.606
OH, MY GOD.
YOU'RE SO HIP,
I COULD PUKE.

06:12.706 --> 06:15.275
I CAN NEVER PULL OFF
THAT HAT. HOW DO YOU
PULL OFF THAT HAT?

06:15.375 --> 06:17.911
I LOVE YOUR JUMPER.

06:18.011 --> 06:20.814
YOUR SKIN IS, LIKE,
HAUNTINGLY BEAUTIFUL.

06:20.914 --> 06:23.150
- CAN I PUT MY BAGS DOWN?
- WHAT?

06:23.250 --> 06:24.718
OH, MY GOD, OF COURSE.

06:24.818 --> 06:26.820
YOU'RE LIKE
MY FAVORITE COUSIN.

06:26.920 --> 06:29.089
I'M THE ONLY ONE
OF MY GIRLFRIENDS THAT
HAS A BRITISH COUSIN.

06:29.189 --> 06:31.391
HOW LONG DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE GOING TO STAY FOR?

06:31.492 --> 06:33.393
NOT THAT I'M ASKING YOU TO
LEAVE. YOU CAN TOTALLY STAY
FOREVER IF YOU WANT TO.

06:33.494 --> 06:36.329
- CAN I HAVE
SOMETHING TO EAT?
- YEAH.

06:36.430 --> 06:38.331
YOU'VE BEEN INTERNING
THERE FOR A YEAR.

06:38.432 --> 06:40.501
YOU NEED TO TELL THEM
IT'S TIME TO GET PAID.

06:40.601 --> 06:42.736
COSTS A LOT OF MONEY
TO LOOK THIS CHEAP.

06:42.836 --> 06:45.639
THIS IS NOT A JOKE.
IF YOU CAN'T AFFORD TO PAY
YOUR HALF OF THE RENT,

06:45.739 --> 06:47.941
CHARLIE IS GOING
TO MOVE IN HERE.

06:48.041 --> 06:51.111
- YOU'RE DUMPING CHARLIE.
- I DIDN'T SAY THAT.

06:51.211 --> 06:54.214
SO I TEXTED ADAM ABOUT
TONIGHT, AND I HAVE NOT
HEARD ANYTHING BACK.

06:54.314 --> 06:56.083
HANNAH, LOOK AT ME.

06:56.183 --> 06:58.051
HE NEVER,
EVER TEXTS YOU BACK.

06:58.151 --> 06:59.787
MAYBE I SHOULD CALL HIM.

06:59.887 --> 07:01.789
DIDN'T YOU SAY TEXTING'S
LIKE THE LOWEST FORM
OF COMMUNICATION

07:01.889 --> 07:03.924
- ON THE PILLAR OF CHAT?
- THE TOTEM OF CHAT.

07:04.024 --> 07:05.826
NO, THE LOWEST,
THAT WOULD BE FACEBOOK,

07:05.926 --> 07:08.128
FOLLOWED BY GCHAT,
THEN TEXTING,

07:08.228 --> 07:09.763
- THEN EMAIL, THEN PHONE.
- GOTCHA.

07:09.863 --> 07:12.633
FACE-TO-FACE IS,
OF COURSE, IDEAL.
BUT IT'S NOT OF THIS TIME.

07:12.733 --> 07:14.568
OKAY, BUT THEN HOW
AM I SUPPOSED TO GET
HIM FACE-TO-FACE

07:14.668 --> 07:17.671
IF HE REFUSES TO TEXT ME?

07:17.771 --> 07:19.673
THINK JESSA WILL
REALLY APPRECIATE THE
WELCOME-HOME DINNER.

07:19.773 --> 07:21.609
IT'S A VERY FRIENDISH
THING OF US TO DO.

07:23.176 --> 07:24.411
WHAT?

07:24.512 --> 07:25.813
I JUST KNOW SHE'S
GOING TO SHOW UP LATE,

07:25.913 --> 07:27.748
WEARING SOME FABULOUS
BLANKETY DRESS

07:27.848 --> 07:29.783
FROM A GRECIAN MARKETPLACE
AND BE LIKE...

07:29.883 --> 07:31.519
( British accent )
"OH, I CAN'T REMEMBER
WHERE I GOT THIS."

07:31.619 --> 07:33.587
I'M REALLY GLAD THAT
SHE'S COMING HOME.

07:33.687 --> 07:35.388
BUT EVERY TIME SHE
COMES INTO TOWN,

07:35.489 --> 07:37.024
YOU GO ON SOME
WEEK-LONG BENDER,

07:37.124 --> 07:38.826
AND THEN SHE LEAVES TO GO
OFF TO HER NEXT COUNTRY

07:38.926 --> 07:40.427
AND I'M LEFT TO
PICK UP THE PIECES.

07:40.528 --> 07:42.395
OKAY, IT IS SO RARE
THAT I SAY THIS,

07:42.496 --> 07:44.131
BUT I JUST
THINK SHE'S FUN.

07:44.231 --> 07:46.399
YEAH, IT WAS REALLY
FUN WHEN SHE FUCKED
CAROLYN'S BOYFRIEND.

07:46.500 --> 07:47.968
SHE DIDN'T FUCK
YOUR BOYFRIEND.

07:48.068 --> 07:49.570
THAT'S 'CAUSE HE WAS
IN PRAGUE THAT SEMESTER.

07:49.670 --> 07:51.171
THANKS SO MUCH.

07:51.271 --> 07:52.673
IT'S A GREAT DEAL
FOR NOLITA.

07:52.773 --> 07:54.908
I MEAN 2,100 A MONTH?
AMAZE.

07:55.008 --> 07:57.177
IT'S A LITTLE MORE
EXPENSIVE THAN THE DORMS,

07:57.277 --> 07:59.212
BUT AUNT ILENE THINKS
IT'S LIKE THE PERFECT
BACHELORETTE PAD.

07:59.312 --> 08:01.949
- I MEAN...
- ( chuckles )

08:02.049 --> 08:04.317
DO YOU LIKE THE POSTER?

08:04.417 --> 08:06.887
OH, YOU KNOW, I'VE NEVER
SEEN THAT MOVIE.

08:06.987 --> 08:09.256
- ONLY THE SHOW?
- IS IT A SHOW?

08:09.356 --> 08:11.291
OH, MY GOD.
YOU'RE NOT SERIOUS.

08:11.391 --> 08:13.627
I MEAN, THAT'S LIKE NOT
BEING ON FACEBOOK.

08:13.727 --> 08:17.397
- I'M NOT ON FACEBOOK.
- YOU'RE SO FUCKING CLASSY.

08:17.497 --> 08:21.068
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE FUNNY
BECAUSE YOU'RE DEFINITELY
LIKE A CARRIE

08:21.168 --> 08:24.538
BUT WITH, LIKE,
SOME SAMANTHA ASPECTS
AND CHARLOTTE HAIR.

08:24.638 --> 08:27.808
- THAT'S LIKE A REALLY
GOOD COMBINATION.
- OH, THANK YOU.

08:27.908 --> 08:30.978
I THINK I'M DEFINITELY
A CARRIE AT HEART,

08:31.078 --> 08:32.846
BUT, LIKE, SOMETIMES--

08:32.946 --> 08:35.015
SOMETIMES SAMANTHA
KIND OF COMES OUT.

08:35.115 --> 08:37.717
AND THEN WHEN I'M AT
SCHOOL, I DEFINITELY TRY
AND PUT ON MY MIRANDA HAT.

08:37.818 --> 08:39.886
WHERE WERE YOU
BEFORE FRANCE?

08:39.986 --> 08:43.624
BEFORE FRANCE,
I WAS IN AMSTERDAM--

08:43.724 --> 08:44.992
NO, I WAS IN BALI,

08:45.092 --> 08:47.160
AND I WAS
SHUCKING PEARLS THERE.

08:47.260 --> 08:48.962
AND THEN I MET A SURFER--

08:49.062 --> 08:50.798
OH, MY GOD.
DID HE REALLY LIKE YOU?

08:50.898 --> 08:54.602
- HE REALLY LIKED YOU, RIGHT?
- YEAH, HE REALLY LIKED ME.

09:06.379 --> 09:08.849
- HANNAH?
- HELLO, ALISTAIR.

09:08.949 --> 09:10.483
( mumbling )

09:10.584 --> 09:12.920
HELLO.

09:13.020 --> 09:14.688
YOU SEEM EAGER.

09:14.788 --> 09:17.390
AS YOU KNOW,
I'VE BEEN WORKING HERE
FOR OVER A YEAR.

09:17.490 --> 09:19.693
HAS IT BEEN THAT LONG?

09:19.793 --> 09:22.896
WELL, YOU ARE AN INVALUABLE
PART OF OUR OPERATION.

09:22.996 --> 09:24.898
WHICH I RECENTLY LEARNED
MEANS VERY VALUABLE

09:24.998 --> 09:26.934
AS OPPOSED TO NOT
AT ALL VALUABLE.

09:27.034 --> 09:29.603
AND I WANTED TO
LET YOU KNOW THAT MY
CIRCUMSTANCES HAVE CHANGED

09:29.703 --> 09:32.039
AND I CAN NO LONGER AFFORD
TO WORK FOR FREE.

09:32.139 --> 09:34.541
OH, HANNAH.

09:34.642 --> 09:36.109
I AM SO SORRY TO LOSE YOU.

09:36.209 --> 09:38.746
I WAS JUST GOING TO START
YOU MANNING OUR TWITTER,

09:38.846 --> 09:40.814
YOU HAVE JUST THE
QUIPPY VOICE FOR THAT.

09:40.914 --> 09:42.750
OH, NO, I'M NOT QUITTING.

09:42.850 --> 09:46.519
I JUST-- I KNOW THAT JOY-LYNN
GOT HIRED AFTER INTERNING,

09:46.620 --> 09:48.321
- SO I THOUGHT THAT MAYBE--
- HANNAH.

09:48.421 --> 09:50.190
JOY-LYNN KNOWS PHOTOSHOP.

09:50.290 --> 09:52.325
NOW, IN THIS ECONOMY,

09:52.425 --> 09:55.295
DO YOU KNOW
HOW MANY INTERNSHIP
REQUESTS I GET EVERY DAY?

09:55.395 --> 09:57.698
- I WOULD ASSUME A LOT.
- 50, IT'S ABOUT 50.

09:57.798 --> 10:00.267
I PRACTICALLY ROUTE THEM
INTO MY SPAM FOLDERS.

10:00.367 --> 10:03.904
SO, IF YOU THINK
YOU HAVE JUST NOTHING LEFT
TO LEARN FROM US...

10:04.004 --> 10:06.239
NO, IT IS NOT THAT, REALLY.

10:06.339 --> 10:08.008
I JUST, YOU KNOW, GOTTA EAT.

10:08.108 --> 10:11.344
WELL, WHEN YOU GET
HUNGRY ENOUGH,

10:11.444 --> 10:12.980
YOU'RE GOING
TO FIGURE IT OUT.

10:13.080 --> 10:17.017
DO YOU MEAN LIKE PHYSICALLY
HUNGRY OR HUNGRY FOR THE JOB?

10:18.686 --> 10:20.954
I AM REALLY GOING
TO MISS YOUR ENERGY.

10:21.054 --> 10:23.657
I THINK THIS IS GOING
TO BE REALLY GOOD FOR YOU.

10:28.128 --> 10:30.197
UH, YOU MENTIONED THAT WHEN
I WAS FINISHED WITH MY BOOK,

10:30.297 --> 10:31.699
I COULD SEND IT TO YOU.

10:31.799 --> 10:35.335
WELL, WE WOULDN'T
HAVE YOU HERE

10:35.435 --> 10:37.805
TO READ IT FOR US.
WOULD WE?

10:42.509 --> 10:44.144
( sighs )

10:45.445 --> 10:47.514
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

10:47.614 --> 10:49.149
WILL YOU GET ME A LUNA BAR?

10:49.249 --> 10:52.820
AND A SMARTWATER
AND VITAMINWATER?

10:59.126 --> 11:01.161
YO, HEY.

11:01.261 --> 11:03.063
YEAH, NO, I'M ACTUALLY
JUST LEAVING A FRIEND'S HOUSE

11:03.163 --> 11:06.133
THAT'S, LIKE, RIGHT
BY YOUR HOUSE, SO...

11:07.534 --> 11:09.136
YEAH?

11:10.938 --> 11:14.742
- HEY. HEY, DOLL.
- HEY.

11:14.842 --> 11:16.409
"DOLL," THAT IS WHAT
MY DAD CALLS ME.

11:16.509 --> 11:19.046
YEAH, I KNOW. HE TOLD ME.
WE'RE IN THE SAME CIRCLE JERK.

11:19.146 --> 11:20.480
( both chuckle )

11:20.580 --> 11:24.251
- I JUST HAD
THE WORST EVER DAY.
- YOU WERE NEARBY?

11:24.351 --> 11:25.719
WHY?

11:25.819 --> 11:28.756
UM, I GOT FIRED FROM
MY JOB.

11:28.856 --> 11:31.624
WEREN'T YOU AN INTERN?

11:31.725 --> 11:34.627
WELL, I WAS WORKING
THERE FOR A WHILE SO I WAS
TECHNICALLY AN INTERN.

11:34.728 --> 11:37.297
SO BASICALLY THEY
JUST ASKED YOU TO NOT
HANG OUT THERE ANYMORE?

11:37.397 --> 11:40.333
- BUT I WAS
WALKING OVER HERE--
- ( laughs )

11:40.433 --> 11:43.436
FUNNY.
I WAS ON MY WAY OVER HERE
AND I WAS PANICKING,

11:43.536 --> 11:45.638
BUT THEN IT OCCURRED
TO ME, I'M AN ENGLISH MAJOR,
THERE HAS TO BE SOME--

11:45.739 --> 11:48.675
MAJOR DOESN'T MATTER.
I WAS COMP LIT AND IT
HASN'T DONE SHIT.

11:48.776 --> 11:51.678
YEAH, BUT YOU'RE AN ACTOR,
SO AREN'T YOU ALWAYS COMPARING
DIFFERENT LITERATURE?

11:51.779 --> 11:54.414
I-I DON'T KNOW.

11:57.217 --> 12:00.153
PLUS I'M INTO THIS
WOODWORKING STUFF.
IT'S JUST MORE HONEST.

12:00.253 --> 12:02.790
YEAH, IT ALL LOOKS AWESOME.
BUT WHAT ABOUT YOUR PLAY?

12:02.890 --> 12:05.959
YEAH, WE'RE NOT DOING IT.
THAT GUY'S A DICK.

12:06.059 --> 12:09.729
- CAN I SIT DOWN?
- YEAH.

12:16.703 --> 12:20.107
SO IF I TELL YOU SOMETHING,
WILL YOU PROMISE THAT YOU
WON'T JUDGE ME?

12:20.207 --> 12:21.541
YES.

12:21.641 --> 12:25.578
TILL YESTERDAY,
I GOT ALL OF MY MONEY
FROM MY PARENTS.

12:25.678 --> 12:27.480
OKAY.

12:27.580 --> 12:30.250
DOES THAT MAKE YOU FEEL SICK?
MAKE YOU NOT WANT TO TALK TO ME?

12:30.350 --> 12:33.486
NO, I MEAN I WOULDN'T
TAKE SHIT FROM MY PARENTS.
THEY'RE BUFFOONS.

12:33.586 --> 12:36.756
- BUT MY GRANDMA
GIVES ME $800 A MONTH.
- WHOA.

12:36.857 --> 12:38.591
MM-HMM.

12:38.691 --> 12:41.061
SO IS, LIKE, THAT HOW
YOU SUPPORT YOURSELF?

12:41.161 --> 12:43.797
YEAH.
I MEAN, I SUPPLEMENT.

12:43.897 --> 12:47.100
BUT IT GIVES ME
THE FREEDOM THAT I DON'T
HAVE TO BE ANYONE'S SLAVE.

12:47.200 --> 12:50.470
YOU SHOULD NEVER BE
ANYONE'S FUCKING SLAVE.

12:50.570 --> 12:52.539
EXCEPT MINE.

12:58.111 --> 12:59.446
YOU'RE FEELING
PRETTY FRISKY.

12:59.546 --> 13:02.115
I REALLY DESPISE THAT WORD.
I HATE IT SO MUCH.

13:09.189 --> 13:12.425
I LIKE YOU SO MUCH.
I DON'T KNOW WHERE
YOU DISAPPEAR TO.

13:13.793 --> 13:15.996
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
I'M RIGHT HERE.

13:20.467 --> 13:22.235
IT'S SO FUNNY THAT
IT'S STILL LIGHT OUT,

13:22.335 --> 13:24.371
BUT IT'S GETTING DARK
A LOT EARLIER THESE DAYS.

13:24.471 --> 13:28.108
- IS THIS SOME OF YOUR POETRY?
- DON'T BE A JERK.

13:28.208 --> 13:29.442
WHO, ME?

13:31.678 --> 13:33.146
DO YOU KNOW THAT PART
ON YOUR RESUME

13:33.246 --> 13:35.248
WHERE THEY ASK YOU TO LIST
ALL OF YOUR SPECIAL SKILLS?

13:35.348 --> 13:37.184
I HAVEN'T APPLIED FOR A JOB
IN A LONG FUCKING TIME.

13:37.284 --> 13:39.286
IT'S THE THING WHERE THEY
ASK YOU TO LIST, LIKE,

13:39.386 --> 13:40.921
YOGA, SPANISH,

13:41.021 --> 13:43.590
WATERSKIING,
PHOTOSHOP.

13:43.690 --> 13:45.625
I FEEL LIKE I...

13:45.725 --> 13:47.327
DON'T HAVE ANY
SPECIAL SKILLS.

13:47.427 --> 13:50.497
- I HAVE SOMETHING YOU CAN DO.
- WHAT?

13:50.597 --> 13:53.833
BUT FIRST I HAVE
TO SEE IF YOU FULFILL
ALL THE REQUIREMENTS.

13:53.934 --> 13:55.502
WHAT ARE THE REQUIREMENTS?

13:55.602 --> 13:57.470
LIE ON YOUR STOMACH.

13:57.570 --> 13:59.606
- NOW?
- YES, NOW. WAIT.

14:04.544 --> 14:08.115
YOU MODERN CAREER WOMAN,
I KNOW WHAT YOU LIKE.

14:08.215 --> 14:09.849
YOU THINK YOU CAN JUST
COME IN HERE

14:09.950 --> 14:12.519
AND TALK ALL THAT NOISE?

14:12.619 --> 14:14.922
UH, NO.

14:15.022 --> 14:19.192
GRAB YOUR LEGS.
( grunts )

14:19.292 --> 14:22.495
- JUST-- WHAT DID YOU SAY?
- GRAB YOUR LEGS.

14:22.595 --> 14:24.531
OKAY.

14:24.631 --> 14:26.199
OKAY, THIS IS GOOD.

14:26.299 --> 14:29.169
- I'M GONNA GO GET SOME LUBE.
- WHY DO WE NEED TO GET LUBE?

14:31.204 --> 14:33.240
WHEN I GET BACK, I WANT YOU
IN THE EXACT SAME POSITION,

14:33.340 --> 14:35.708
BUT TAKE ALL THE REST
OF THE SHIT OFF.

14:35.808 --> 14:37.777
WILL YOU GET A CONDOM?

14:37.877 --> 14:40.313
I'LL CONSIDER IT.

14:58.665 --> 15:00.900
JESUS FUCKING CHRIST.

15:01.001 --> 15:03.270
THIS IS REALLY HARD.

15:05.973 --> 15:08.408
( humming )

15:16.649 --> 15:19.152
- IS THAT OKAY?
- YEAH.

15:19.252 --> 15:21.254
- YOU PUTTING ON A CONDOM?
- NO!

15:21.354 --> 15:23.090
- WAIT, YOU ARE, RIGHT?
- YES.

15:23.190 --> 15:24.724
OKAY, 'CAUSE WHEN YOU
SAID THE THING ABOUT LUBE,

15:24.824 --> 15:26.593
I WAS WORRIED YOU WERE
GOING TO TRY TO--

15:26.693 --> 15:28.161
DO THAT.
PLEASE DON'T DO THAT.

15:28.261 --> 15:30.230
THAT FEELS AWFUL.
THANK YOU.

15:30.330 --> 15:33.900
- IT'S ALL RIGHT.
- OKAY. THANK YOU.

15:34.001 --> 15:35.502
THAT'S THE RIGHT SPOT.

15:35.602 --> 15:37.237
YEAH, SORRY.

15:37.337 --> 15:39.406
SO I CAN JUST STAY LIKE
THIS FOR A LITTLE WHILE?

15:39.506 --> 15:41.008
YEAH.

15:41.108 --> 15:43.410
- DO YOU NEED ME
TO MOVE MORE?
- WHAT?

15:43.510 --> 15:46.246
I JUST DIDN'T KNOW IF
YOU WANTED ME TO BE MORE
LIKE-- LIKE THAT.

15:46.346 --> 15:48.181
OH, NO. THIS IS FINE.
YOU'RE DOING GREAT.

15:48.281 --> 15:49.482
THIS IS ALL
YOU NEED TO DO.

15:49.582 --> 15:51.218
I'M SORRY ABOUT THE
WRONG HOLE THING.

15:51.318 --> 15:53.386
I JUST-- I DON'T WANT
TO DO IT NOW,

15:53.486 --> 15:55.388
AND IF WE DID, I'D JUST
WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT

15:55.488 --> 15:57.590
AND JUST FIGURE OUT WHAT--
IT'S JUST NOT COMFORTABLE
FOR ME--

15:57.690 --> 15:59.959
- LET'S PLAY THE QUIET GAME.
- SO YOU'RE NOT MAD AT ME?

16:00.060 --> 16:01.894
NO, I'M GREAT.

16:01.995 --> 16:04.331
A GREAT TIME.

16:04.431 --> 16:05.798
Charlie:
YOU KNOW WHAT
WOULD BE CRAZY?

16:05.898 --> 16:08.168
- WHAT WOULD BE CRAZY?
- IF WE...

16:08.268 --> 16:11.171
JUST GOT CRAZY,
RIGHT HERE RIGHT NOW.

16:11.271 --> 16:12.739
WE COULD JUST DO THAT.

16:12.839 --> 16:15.942
NOBODY'S STOPPING US.
NOBODY'S HOME.

16:16.043 --> 16:18.145
WHAT WOULD TURN YOU
ON THE MOST RIGHT NOW?

16:18.245 --> 16:21.081
WHAT WOULD TURN ME ON
THE MOST?

16:21.181 --> 16:23.683
WHAT WOULD TURN
YOU ON THE MOST?
( chuckles )

16:23.783 --> 16:26.386
TO TURN YOU ON, THAT'S WHAT
WOULD TURN ME ON.

16:26.486 --> 16:31.024
- LET ME DO THAT.
- OKAY, UH...

16:32.192 --> 16:35.662
UM, WHAT IF YOU
WERE A STRANGER?

16:35.762 --> 16:38.098
OH, YEAH, A STRANGER.

16:38.198 --> 16:39.966
WHAT IF YOU WERE JUST LIKE
A TOTALLY DIFFERENT PERSON?

16:40.067 --> 16:43.070
YOU DIDN'T ACT LIKE YOU?

16:46.373 --> 16:49.342
- ( doorbell buzzes )
- I THINK JESSA'S HERE.

16:49.442 --> 16:51.844
- OH, NO. I THINK
THAT MIGHT BE RAY.
- YOU INVITED RAY?

16:51.944 --> 16:56.483
- IT WAS GOING TO BE
LIKE A FOUR-PERSON PARTY.
- THAT'S CALLED DINNER.

16:57.550 --> 16:58.751
GOSH, I'M SORRY.

16:58.851 --> 17:02.589
- WHAT'S WITH ALL THE TATTOOS?
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

17:03.356 --> 17:05.291
WHY'D YOU DO ALL OF THEM?

17:05.392 --> 17:08.528
THEY'RE ILLUSTRATIONS FROM
CHILDREN'S BOOKS MOSTLY.

17:13.400 --> 17:14.701
( growls )

17:16.069 --> 17:17.204
- EVEN THE ONE ON YOUR ASS?
- ( slaps )

17:17.304 --> 17:19.705
UH, NO. THAT ONE
MY FRIEND JESSA DID

17:19.806 --> 17:21.108
SOPHOMORE YEAR
WITH A SAFETY PIN.

17:21.208 --> 17:23.009
IT'S A SNAKE WRAPPED
AROUND THE MOON.

17:23.109 --> 17:24.977
WHEN DID YOU DO THAT?

17:25.078 --> 17:27.579
I DID THEM MOSTLY
IN HIGH SCHOOL.

17:27.680 --> 17:30.617
WHY?

17:30.717 --> 17:34.254
TRUTHFULLY?
I GAINED A BUNCH OF
WEIGHT VERY QUICKLY,

17:34.354 --> 17:36.189
AND I JUST FELT VERY OUT
OF CONTROL OF MY OWN BODY,

17:36.289 --> 17:37.490
AND IT WAS JUST THIS,
LIKE, RIOT GIRL IDEA LIKE,

17:37.590 --> 17:40.260
"I'M TAKING CONTROL
OF MY OWN SHAPE."

17:43.496 --> 17:46.065
- YOU KNOW, I WAS FAT
IN HIGH SCHOOL.
- REALLY?

17:46.166 --> 17:48.668
YEAH, BUT I DIDN'T GO
DRAWING ALL OVER MYSELF.

17:50.470 --> 17:53.406
YOU'RE NOT THAT FAT ANYMORE.
YOU CAN JUST HAVE THEM
LASERED OFF.

17:56.309 --> 17:57.144
MM.

17:57.244 --> 18:00.280
- MMM.
- ( laughs )

18:01.248 --> 18:04.251
- WHAT TIME IS IT?
- UM...

18:05.685 --> 18:06.986
5:00.

18:07.086 --> 18:09.822
( scoffs )
WHAT TIME IS IT?

18:09.922 --> 18:11.191
9:45.

18:11.291 --> 18:13.726
I AM SO LATE
FOR THIS DINNER THING.

18:13.826 --> 18:15.495
FUCK.

18:15.595 --> 18:18.064
SERIOUSLY, THIS WAS
REALLY, REALLY NICE.

18:18.165 --> 18:21.168
IT WAS REALLY GOOD
TO SEE YOU.

18:21.268 --> 18:22.535
WELL, I'M GLAD.
THANKS FOR COMING.

18:22.635 --> 18:24.837
IT MADE ME FEEL
A LOT BETTER, SO...

18:25.905 --> 18:27.974
I'LL SEE YOU SOON?

18:28.074 --> 18:30.243
YEAH, JUST TEXT ME.

18:37.750 --> 18:40.387
IT'S NOT LIKE
THEY'RE COMMANDMENTS,
BUT GENERALLY SPEAKING,

18:40.487 --> 18:42.922
AS A GENERAL RULE,
I TRY NOT TO DATE WOMEN
THAT ARE UNDER 25

18:43.022 --> 18:46.193
OR THAT HAVE BEEN
AT ONE POINT IN THEIR LIFE
PENETRATED BY A DRUMMER.

18:46.293 --> 18:47.860
- ONE TIME!
- GUILTY OF BOTH.

18:47.960 --> 18:49.796
BUT I WAS WALKING THROUGH
THE MALL THIS MORNING,

18:49.896 --> 18:53.099
I SEE THESE TWO HUGE
GREEN ORBS BOBBING
THROUGH THE MALL.

18:53.200 --> 18:55.468
- LOOK AT THESE EYES!
HAVE YOU SEEN THESE EYES?
- THEY'RE MY EYES!

18:55.568 --> 18:57.804
- HE'S SO NICE TO ME.
- RIDICULOUS.

18:57.904 --> 18:59.439
LOOK AT THOSE LASHES, TOO.
HAVE YOU SEEN THESE LASHES?

18:59.539 --> 19:02.442
- GUILTY AS CHARGED.
- SO CUTE.

19:03.210 --> 19:04.511
YOU OKAY?

19:04.611 --> 19:07.547
YEAH, I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE
HANNAH DIDN'T SHOW UP.

19:07.647 --> 19:10.750
WE'RE HERE. LIVIN' IT UP.
PARTYIN' DOWN.

19:10.850 --> 19:13.720
I DON'T MEAN TO BE RUDE.
I'M JUST NOT REALLY INTO
EATING THIS WEEK.

19:13.820 --> 19:16.189
Marnie:
HANNAH WAS THE ONE SAYING
THIS WAS OUR BIG REUNION

19:16.289 --> 19:18.491
AND NOW SHE'S
NOWHERE TO BE FOUND.

19:18.591 --> 19:20.327
ARE YOU WORRIED?
SHOULD WE CALL SOMEONE?

19:20.427 --> 19:22.762
NO, ESPECIALLY
BECAUSE I KNOW EXACTLY
WHERE SHE IS.

19:22.862 --> 19:25.898
SHE'S OFF HAVING GROSS
SEX WITH THAT ANIMAL.
( chuckles )

19:25.998 --> 19:27.600
IN WHAT WAY, GROSS?

19:27.700 --> 19:30.203
CHARLIE WOULD LIKE
TO AT LEAST HEAR
ABOUT SOME SEX.

19:30.303 --> 19:34.507
- EXCUSE ME?
- RAY'S JUST BEING
MOTIVATIONAL.

19:34.607 --> 19:36.676
COME ON, AT LEAST
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO
ENTERTAIN JESSA ON HER OWN.

19:36.776 --> 19:38.611
YEAH, 'CAUSE I DIDN'T
GET TO ENTERTAIN ANYBODY

19:38.711 --> 19:40.380
BECAUSE NO ONE CAME.

19:40.480 --> 19:42.782
- Jessa: HANNAH! MARNIE!
- WHO'S THAT?
SHE SOUNDS BRITISH.

19:42.882 --> 19:45.285
OH, I ORDERED A FEW
HOOKERS, IF YOU
GUYS DON'T MIND.

19:45.385 --> 19:47.220
- ( laughing )
- BULGARIAN GIRLS.
TOP-SHELF.

19:47.320 --> 19:49.889
- NICE GIRLS.
- HE KILLS ME.
I SWEAR TO GOD.

19:49.989 --> 19:52.292
MARNIE!

19:54.294 --> 19:56.563
TOP LOCK!

19:57.830 --> 20:00.099
( music playing )

20:00.199 --> 20:04.337
* GOD, SHE'S FINE,
FINE, FINE... *

20:04.437 --> 20:06.539
Jessa:
PARIS IS REALLY
WHERE YOU SHOULD BE.

20:06.639 --> 20:08.608
IF YOU'RE A
FRANCOPHILE LIKE...

20:08.708 --> 20:10.843
- ME AND YOU, OBVIOUSLY.
- YEAH.

20:10.943 --> 20:13.813
- THEN YOU'VE GOT
TO GO TO FRANCE.
- YOU HAVE TO GO.

20:13.913 --> 20:16.649
Jessa:
I WAS A LIVE-IN EDUCATOR
FOR THESE THREE CHILDREN,

20:16.749 --> 20:18.485
AND THEY ALL SANG.

20:18.585 --> 20:20.720
AND THEIR FATHER
WAS A BRILLIANT
PACIFIST THINKER.

20:20.820 --> 20:24.457
ISN'T THAT THE PLOT TO
"THE SOUND OF MUSIC"?

20:24.557 --> 20:26.393
- IT IS.
- Marnie: WE REALLY WANT
TO TRAVEL MORE.

20:26.493 --> 20:28.261
- WE COULD JUST GO.
- UP AND GO.

20:28.361 --> 20:30.162
I AM SO SORRY
I'M SO LATE.

20:30.263 --> 20:32.031
- HANNAH BANANA.
- WOULD YOU PLEASE COME HERE
AND TALK TO US?

20:32.131 --> 20:33.333
- HELLO.
- ( gasps )

20:33.433 --> 20:36.336
( singsong )
YOU'RE HERE.
YOU'RE HERE. HI.

20:36.436 --> 20:39.639
( kisses )
WHAT'S GOING ON?
YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL.

20:40.740 --> 20:43.142
- WHAT'D YOU SAY?
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

20:43.242 --> 20:47.380
- SHE SMELLS LIKE SEX.
- NO, BUT YOU SHOWERED
THIS MORNING.

20:47.480 --> 20:49.148
Hannah:
SO I CALCULATED, AND I CAN
LAST IN NEW YORK

20:49.248 --> 20:50.617
FOR 3 1/2 MORE DAYS.

20:50.717 --> 20:52.585
MAYBE SEVEN IF
I DON'T EAT LUNCH.

20:52.685 --> 20:55.755
I'M GOING TO FIND YOU A JOB
WORTHY OF YOUR TALENTS.

20:55.855 --> 20:57.524
WELL, I APPRECIATE THAT,

20:57.624 --> 20:58.858
BUT I DON'T KNOW
HOW YOU'RE GOING TO FIND
A JOB FAST ENOUGH.

20:58.958 --> 21:00.393
I'M GOING TO HAVE
TO WORK AT McDONALD'S.

21:00.493 --> 21:02.829
YOU'RE NOT GOING
TO WORK AT McDONALD'S.

21:02.929 --> 21:04.297
Ray:
WHAT'S WRONG WITH McDONALD'S?
YOU SHOULD WORK AT McDONALD'S.

21:04.397 --> 21:07.434
IT'S GREAT.
IT'S FUCKING INCREDIBLE.

21:07.534 --> 21:09.068
YOU KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE
McDONALD'S FEEDS EVERY DAY?

21:09.168 --> 21:10.603
YOU KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE
IT EMPLOYS AROUND THE WORLD?

21:10.703 --> 21:12.939
PLUS, THEY MAKE AN
INCREDIBLE PRODUCT, OKAY?

21:13.039 --> 21:14.407
IT TASTES TREMENDOUS.

21:14.507 --> 21:16.376
IT'S AFFORDABLE.
IT'S FUCKING CONSISTENT.

21:16.476 --> 21:18.277
I CAN WALK INTO A
McDONALD'S IN NIGERIA,

21:18.378 --> 21:19.879
ORDER CHICKEN McNUGGETS.

21:19.979 --> 21:21.280
WHEN I BITE INTO IT, YOU KNOW
WHAT IT'S GOING TO TASTE LIKE?

21:21.381 --> 21:23.015
IT'S GOING TO TASTE
LIKE HOME.

21:23.115 --> 21:25.485
IT DOESN'T MEAN
I HAVE TO WORK THERE.
I WENT TO COLLEGE.

21:25.585 --> 21:26.919
YEAH, I WENT TO COLLEGE, TOO.
YOU KNOW WHERE IT LEFT ME?

21:27.019 --> 21:29.456
I HAVE $50,000
IN STUDENT LOANS.

21:29.556 --> 21:31.290
THAT'S HOW DEEP
IN DEBT I AM.

21:31.391 --> 21:34.193
I'M SORRY, BUT WATCHING
THIS, THIS IS LIKE
WATCHING "CLUELESS."

21:34.293 --> 21:35.795
THE MOVIE
OR THE TV SHOW?

21:35.895 --> 21:38.297
- Marnie: WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING OVER THERE?

21:38.398 --> 21:40.299
I'M MAKING A LITTLE BREW.

21:40.400 --> 21:41.834
Charlie:
HE'S MAKING A TEA
OF OPIUM PODS.

21:41.934 --> 21:44.270
OH, COOL. SO YOU BROUGHT
OPIUM INTO OUR APARTMENT.

21:44.371 --> 21:45.905
WELL, YEAH, THIS STUFF'S
PRETTY MILD.

21:46.005 --> 21:48.775
THIS IS MUCH MILDER THAN
THE STUFF YOU'D SMOKE.

21:48.875 --> 21:50.477
IT'S LEGAL. I GOT IT DOWN
AT THE FLOWER DISTRICT.

21:50.577 --> 21:52.479
YOU CAN JUST GO THERE
AND BUY THE PODS.

21:52.579 --> 21:55.715
- IS IT COOL IF I HAVE A LITTLE?
- Marnie: KNOCK YOURSELF OUT.

21:55.815 --> 21:59.051
- I HATE OPIUM.
- OH, YEAH, WHAT'S
YOUR THING? COKE?

21:59.151 --> 22:00.720
NO, I NEVER DO COKE.

22:00.820 --> 22:02.589
EVERY TIME I DO COKE,
I SHIT MY PANTS.
( laughs )

22:02.689 --> 22:04.424
( laughing )
OH, JESUS CHRIST.

22:04.524 --> 22:06.526
- Hannah: THAT'S HORRIBLE.
- Jessa: IT HAPPENS.

22:06.626 --> 22:09.095
- WHAT DOES IT TASTE LIKE?
- IT KINDA TASTES LIKE TWIGS.

22:10.129 --> 22:11.598
YEAH, I'LL HAVE SOME.

22:11.698 --> 22:13.466
MAYBE YOU SHOULDN'T.
YOU'RE SUPER-SENSITIVE TO DRUGS.

22:13.566 --> 22:15.234
I THINK I'M GOING TO BE FINE,
OKAY? HAND IT OVER.

22:15.334 --> 22:17.570
IT'S HOT.

22:20.172 --> 22:22.208
- ( gags )
- Marnie: OH, JESUS.

22:22.308 --> 22:24.777
THIS DOES NOT
TASTE LIKE TWIX.

22:24.877 --> 22:26.413
NOT TWIX, TWIGS.

22:26.513 --> 22:28.080
TWIGS, LIKE SMALL STICKS.

22:29.181 --> 22:30.850
( sighs )

22:33.653 --> 22:36.723
IF YOU'RE GOING TO VANISH,
YOU HAVE TO CALL, OKAY?

22:36.823 --> 22:39.792
YEAH, OKAY.
I WANNA GO BACK IN THERE.

22:39.892 --> 22:42.529
NO, YOU CAN'T.
I NEED TO TALK
TO YOU FIRST.

22:42.629 --> 22:45.364
ALL YOU NEED TO DO IS TALK
TO YOUR PARENTS, OKAY?

22:45.465 --> 22:47.500
YOU NEED TO ASK THEM
TO SUPPORT YOU

22:47.600 --> 22:49.902
FOR A LITTLE
ITTY-BIT LONGER,

22:50.002 --> 22:51.738
JUST WHILE YOU LOOK
FOR ANOTHER JOB.

22:51.838 --> 22:54.541
AND TELL THEM THAT YOU TAKE
YOUR FUTURE SERIOUSLY.

22:54.641 --> 22:56.543
- BECAUSE YOU DO.
YOU'RE HANNAH.
- ( door opens )

22:56.643 --> 23:00.212
- DOES CHARLIE
HAVE A GIRLFRIEND?
- YES.

23:00.312 --> 23:03.315
MARNIE WAS JUST SAYING THAT
SHE FEELS LIKE I NEED TO GO
AND TALK TO MY PARENTS

23:03.416 --> 23:05.552
AND ASK THEM TO SUPPORT
ME UNTIL I GET A JOB.

23:05.652 --> 23:08.220
WHY DON'T YOU JUST TELL THEM
THAT YOU'RE AN ARTIST?

23:08.320 --> 23:10.623
YOU JUST NEED TO TELL
THEM ONCE AND FOR ALL

23:10.723 --> 23:12.258
THAT YOU ARE AN ARTIST.

23:12.358 --> 23:14.126
JUST TELL THEM YOU'RE
GOING TO GET A JOB,

23:14.226 --> 23:15.828
THAT'S MUCH MORE
CONVINCING.

23:15.928 --> 23:18.665
TELL THEM YOU'LL GET
TUBERCULOSIS IN A GARRET
IF YOU HAVE TO.

23:18.765 --> 23:20.667
TELL THEM IT'S WHAT
FLAUBERT DID.

23:20.767 --> 23:22.569
FLAUBERT IS NOT
A GOOD ROLE MODEL,

23:22.669 --> 23:24.270
AND HAVE YOU MET
HER PARENTS?

23:24.370 --> 23:26.038
SHE CAN'T JUST DO
THE ARTIST THING.

23:26.138 --> 23:27.907
TELL THEM THAT
PICASSO DID IT.

23:28.007 --> 23:31.578
RAPPERS WHO WERE POOR
AND SOLD THEIR TAPES
IN THE STREET DID IT.

23:31.678 --> 23:35.081
IT'S WHAT ELVIS DID.
IT'S WHAT MICK JAGGER DID.

23:35.181 --> 23:36.716
IT'S WHAT MY
STEPBROTHER DID.

23:36.816 --> 23:39.251
THEY ALL STUCK
TO THEIR GUNS.

23:39.351 --> 23:40.553
I NEED TO GO.

23:40.653 --> 23:43.690
YOU JUST DRANK
AN ENTIRE CUP OF OPIUM.

23:43.790 --> 23:46.092
YOU ARE GORGEOUS
AND A VISION.

23:46.192 --> 23:47.760
YOU ARE A BRILLIANT GENIUS.

23:47.860 --> 23:50.262
BOTH OF YOU
ARE SEX GODDESSES.

23:50.362 --> 23:51.598
WHEN I LOOK AT
BOTH OF YOU,

23:51.698 --> 23:53.466
A COLDPLAY SONG
PLAYS IN MY HEART.

23:53.566 --> 23:57.036
- ( door opens, closes )
- BYE.

23:58.204 --> 24:02.274
GOD, SHE SEEMS LIKE
SHE'S IN SUCH A GOOD PLACE.

24:02.374 --> 24:05.612
- ( knocking )
- Hannah: MOM? PAPA?

24:05.712 --> 24:08.681
- I THINK THAT'S HANNAH.
- DID SHE JUST CALL ME PAPA?

24:11.117 --> 24:13.953
- HI!
- OH, HEY. WHAT THE HECK
ARE YOU DOING HERE?

24:14.053 --> 24:16.288
I THOUGHT YOU DIDN'T WANT
TO SEE US ANYMORE.

24:16.388 --> 24:18.991
ACTUALLY, I COULDN'T
BEAR THE IDEA

24:19.091 --> 24:21.994
OF NOT SEEING YOU
BEFORE YOU LEFT TOWN.

24:22.094 --> 24:25.464
BUT MORE IMPORTANT--
HERE, YOU CAN SIT DOWN.
IT'S LATE. I'M SORRY--

24:25.565 --> 24:29.201
IS THAT I
BROUGHT YOU MY BOOK.

24:29.301 --> 24:32.438
I NEED YOU TO READ IT.

24:32.539 --> 24:34.406
- JESUS, IT'S HOT.
- GREAT. YEAH.

24:34.507 --> 24:36.475
- THAT'S FINE.
- ARE YOU BOILING?

24:36.576 --> 24:38.310
GREAT, WE'LL READ IT
ON THE PLANE.

24:38.410 --> 24:40.046
NO, NOW. I NEED YOU
TO READ IT NOW.

24:40.146 --> 24:41.748
BECAUSE...

24:41.848 --> 24:44.016
I DON'T WANT TO
FREAK YOU OUT,

24:44.116 --> 24:46.753
BUT I THINK
THAT I MAY BE

24:46.853 --> 24:48.855
THE VOICE
OF MY GENERATION.

24:50.422 --> 24:52.959
OR AT LEASE A VOICE

24:53.059 --> 24:54.727
OF A GENERATION.

24:54.827 --> 24:57.864
WELL, JUST READ.
DON'T BE SCARED,
JUST ENJOY IT

24:57.964 --> 25:00.132
'CAUSE THERE'S GOING
TO BE PLENTY FOR US
TO TALK ABOUT AFTER.

25:00.232 --> 25:02.001
JUST GO FOR IT.

25:03.870 --> 25:06.172
- ( door opens )
- I NEED TO TALK TO YOU.

25:06.272 --> 25:07.974
ALL RIGHT.

25:08.074 --> 25:10.977
I DO NOT LIKE WHAT JUST
WENT DOWN OUT THERE. AT ALL.

25:11.077 --> 25:12.478
WHAT, WITH HANNAH?

25:12.579 --> 25:15.114
I GUESS I JUST DON'T
UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM.

25:15.214 --> 25:18.685
- SHE SEEMED READY.
- SHE HAD JUST GOTTEN HIGH.

25:18.785 --> 25:21.954
I'D LIKE FOR YOU TO SEE
A REAL HIGH PERSON.

25:22.054 --> 25:25.457
MARNIE, YOU CAN'T MOTHER
HER LIKE THAT.

25:25.558 --> 25:29.128
I'M NOT MOTHERING HER.
I'M LITERALLY PREVENTING
A DISASTER FROM HAPPENING.

25:30.362 --> 25:32.098
HAVE YOU EVEN READ
HER NOVEL?

25:32.198 --> 25:34.133
IT'S A MEMOIR, AND OF
COURSE I'VE READ IT,
I'M HER BEST FRIEND.

25:34.233 --> 25:36.135
( mimicking )
BEST FRIEND. THIS IS
MY BEST FRIEND.

25:36.235 --> 25:38.070
( normal voice )
YOU KNOW, WE DON'T
OWN ANYBODY.

25:38.170 --> 25:40.072
MAYBE YOU DON'T RESPECT WHAT
A BEST FRIENDSHIP MEANS

25:40.172 --> 25:42.875
BECAUSE YOU'VE NEVER STAYED
IN ONE PLACE LONG ENOUGH
TO HAVE ONE.

25:42.975 --> 25:45.111
MARNIE, I CAN'T HELP
YOUR FEELINGS.

25:45.211 --> 25:47.614
MAYBE YOU CAN HELP
BEING TWO HOURS LATE

25:47.714 --> 25:50.516
TO A DINNER PARTY THAT WAS
THROWN FOR YOU, MY GOD!

25:50.617 --> 25:52.151
- IT WAS TWO HOURS?
- YES.

25:52.251 --> 25:53.586
- WHEN WAS DINNER?
- 7:00.

25:53.686 --> 25:56.422
7:00? I THOUGHT THAT
WAS JUST A SUGGESTION.

25:56.522 --> 25:59.358
A SUGGES-- OKAY,
I'M SORRY WE DON'T EAT
AT 1:00 IN THE MORNING,

25:59.458 --> 26:00.993
BUT WE DON'T LIVE
IN BARCELONA.

26:01.093 --> 26:03.696
MAYBE NOT 1:00, BUT 10:00.
10:00 IS REASONABLE.

26:03.796 --> 26:06.032
SEE, THIS IS WHAT YOU DO.
YOU ACT LIKE I'M UPTIGHT,

26:06.132 --> 26:08.534
AND THEN I FOLLOW SUIT.
I BECOME UPTIGHT.

26:08.635 --> 26:10.502
IT IS THE MOST FRUSTRATING
DYNAMIC ON THE PLANET.

26:10.603 --> 26:14.206
- IT DRIVES ME CRAZY.
I CAN'T STAND IT.
- I'M FUCKING PREGNANT.

26:14.306 --> 26:18.077
ALL RIGHT?
I'M PREGNANT.

26:19.511 --> 26:21.948
- ON PURPOSE?
- WHAT DO YOU THINK?

26:22.048 --> 26:23.482
( door opens )

26:23.582 --> 26:25.752
I HAVE TO TELL YOU
SOMETHING, YOU TWO.

26:25.852 --> 26:27.887
YOU GUYS ARE
SO BEAUTIFUL.

26:30.556 --> 26:33.660
OKAY, ALL RIGHT.

26:33.760 --> 26:36.428
THAT'S A HIGH PERSON.

26:36.528 --> 26:39.732
- THIS IS VERY
FUNNY STUFF, LOREEN.
- YEAH. UH-HUH.

26:39.832 --> 26:42.534
- HANNAH, YOU'RE A
VERY FUNNY GIRL.
- THANK YOU, PAPA.

26:42.635 --> 26:44.871
( mumbling )

26:46.572 --> 26:48.240
- OKAY.
- OH.

26:48.340 --> 26:50.509
ALL I AM ASKING FOR

26:50.609 --> 26:52.244
TO FINISH THIS BOOK

26:52.344 --> 26:55.347
IS $1,100 A MONTH

26:55.447 --> 26:56.949
FOR THE NEXT TWO YEARS.

26:57.049 --> 26:59.251
- ( laughs ) THAT'S INSANE.
- THAT'S A CHUNK OF CHANGE.

26:59.351 --> 27:02.088
YOU WOULD SAY IT'S INSANE.
WHO CAN LIVE IN NEW YORK

27:02.188 --> 27:03.389
ON $1,100 A MONTH?

27:03.489 --> 27:06.058
BUT I AM SO COMMITTED
TO THIS BOOK

27:06.158 --> 27:08.695
THAT I AM WILLING TO GET
PRETTY THRIFTY ON THIS.

27:08.795 --> 27:12.031
WHY DON'T YOU GET A JOB
AND START A BLOG?

27:12.131 --> 27:14.166
YOU ARE SO SPOILED.

27:14.266 --> 27:15.968
YEAH, WELL, WHOSE FAULT
IS THAT, MOM?

27:16.068 --> 27:18.470
- YOUR FATHER'S.
- THIS IS MAKING ME
SO UNHAPPY.

27:18.570 --> 27:22.508
- I'M HAVING SUCH
A HORRIBLE FEELING.
- WE'RE NOT WAMU, HANNAH.

27:22.608 --> 27:25.444
- AND THE LEAST YOU CAN DO
IS SIT UP STRAIGHT.
- HANNAH?

27:25.544 --> 27:29.448
HANNAH, JESUS.
HANNAH? HANNAH?

27:29.548 --> 27:32.084
I SHOULDN'T HAVE
TAKEN IT, BUT I WAS JUST
HAVING SUCH A BAD DAY.

27:32.184 --> 27:33.686
TAKEN WHAT?
WHAT DID YOU TAKE?

27:33.786 --> 27:35.154
IS SHE SICK, TED?
DO I NEED TO CALL
A HOSPITAL?

27:35.254 --> 27:36.856
- I THINK SHE MAY BE HIGH.
- ( groaning )

27:36.956 --> 27:38.357
- IT'S LEGAL, LIKE FLOWERS.
- OH, MY GOD.

27:38.457 --> 27:39.926
I'M NOT GOING TO BE ANGRY.
I'M JUST REALLY CURIOUS.

27:40.026 --> 27:42.261
- WHAT DID YOU SMOKE?
- IT'S OPIUM PODS.

27:42.361 --> 27:43.996
IT'S A TEA OF OPIUM PODS.

27:44.096 --> 27:45.765
- WE SHOULD GOOGLE THAT.
- I DON'T NEED TO GOOGLE THAT.

27:45.865 --> 27:48.334
I KNOW ABOUT THAT.
IT'S TANTAMOUNT TO
SMOKING BANANA PEELS.

27:48.434 --> 27:51.637
- FOR CHRIST'S SAKE, LET'S
JUST ORDER HER A COFFEE.
- COFFEE'S FOR GROWN-UPS.

27:51.738 --> 27:53.105
YOU'RE GOING TO DRINK
A STRONG CUP OF COFFEE!

27:53.205 --> 27:55.742
I'M 24 YEARS OLD!
DON'T TELL ME WHAT TO DO.

27:55.842 --> 27:57.409
THIS IS A REAL DISPLAY.

27:57.509 --> 27:59.578
NO, THIS IS THE IMMEDIATE
RESULT OF A COLD APPROACH.

27:59.678 --> 28:01.848
- YOU CAN'T JUST PULL
THE RUG OUT SUDDENLY.
- WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?

28:01.948 --> 28:03.649
- WE SHOULD STAY
A FEW MORE DAYS.
- ( groaning )

28:03.750 --> 28:05.952
I ADMIRE YOUR KIND HEART,
I REALLY DO.

28:06.052 --> 28:08.755
BUT YOU'RE GETTING PLAYED
BY A MAJOR FUCKING PLAYER!

28:08.855 --> 28:10.923
I KNOW! BUT IT'S HARD FOR
ME TO WATCH HER STRUGGLE!

28:11.023 --> 28:12.358
MY SKIRT FEELS SO TIGHT.

28:12.458 --> 28:14.526
MAYBE YOU CAN JUST CUT IT
OPEN WITH A SCISSORS?

28:14.626 --> 28:16.195
IT'S LIKE WATCHING
HER GET A SHOT!

28:16.295 --> 28:18.965
- SHOTS KEEP PEOPLE
FROM GETTING SICK!
- ( coughing )

28:19.065 --> 28:21.433
- I WANT A LAKE HOUSE.
I WORK HARD.
- I KNOW, I KNOW.

28:21.533 --> 28:23.502
I WANT TO SIT
BY A FUCKING LAKE.

28:23.602 --> 28:26.739
- YOU DESERVE A LAKE.
- I'M GONNA DIE LIKE
FLAUBERT IN A GARRET.

28:26.839 --> 28:29.842
DON'T LOOK AT ME.

28:48.694 --> 28:51.163
MOM?

28:52.999 --> 28:54.466
DAD?

28:59.671 --> 29:02.074
HI, I'M IN ROOM 2507,

29:02.174 --> 29:05.077
AND I WANTED TO GET
SOME ROOM SERVICE.

29:05.177 --> 29:06.612
OH.

29:06.712 --> 29:09.849
BUT IS THE ACCOUNT
