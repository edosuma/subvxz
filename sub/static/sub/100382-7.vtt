WEBVTT

00:00.027 --> 00:02.027
Previously on "Lincoln Rhyme..."

00:04.540 --> 00:07.809
Nobody starts killing
three people in a day.

00:07.844 --> 00:09.878
So we find his first kill
or he made a mistake.

00:09.912 --> 00:12.914
30 years ago, Barry Rothko goes jogging.

00:12.949 --> 00:14.716
- Never comes home.
- I have a condition.

00:14.750 --> 00:16.751
- Agoraphobia?
- I wanna get out.

00:16.786 --> 00:19.788
- I just can't.
- You're a gift, Danielle.

00:21.157 --> 00:23.225
What have I done to deserve you?

00:24.927 --> 00:27.395
I found these today. Jane.

00:28.898 --> 00:31.600
Come with me. It'll all be okay.

00:45.882 --> 00:47.916
You're the Bone Collector?

00:52.088 --> 00:54.155
I am.

00:56.592 --> 00:59.261
I tried to shield that from you.

01:01.264 --> 01:03.665
You're insane.

01:08.070 --> 01:10.438
The first Bone Collector killings...

01:10.473 --> 01:12.841
we were together. Do you remember?

01:15.311 --> 01:20.782
You were horrified,
but you... understood.

01:20.816 --> 01:23.118
Some people are built
differently than others.

01:23.152 --> 01:25.954
You said that. Not insane.

01:25.988 --> 01:27.779
Built differently.

01:29.292 --> 01:31.426
Do you believe that now?

01:33.829 --> 01:35.704
I don't know.

01:42.438 --> 01:44.796
I am the man you know.

01:45.708 --> 01:47.609
But...

01:51.039 --> 01:53.430
There are parts that...

01:57.486 --> 01:58.954
That I've hidden.

02:09.332 --> 02:10.502
It's...

02:12.601 --> 02:14.669
Just something I do.

02:14.704 --> 02:18.273
It soothes me.

02:18.307 --> 02:20.123
But you're not soothed.

02:20.776 --> 02:22.668
You're agitated.

02:23.379 --> 02:25.180
I can see it.

02:29.251 --> 02:31.218
But...

02:31.821 --> 02:34.589
you're gonna kill me, aren't you?

02:41.964 --> 02:43.431
<i>I found him.</i>

02:44.037 --> 02:45.443
It's him.

02:46.802 --> 02:50.138
- It's the Bone Collector.
- What did you find?

02:52.174 --> 02:55.143
It's an anonymous card written
to Barry Rothko's mother

02:55.177 --> 02:57.661
a week after he disappeared.

02:58.814 --> 03:00.648
It's written in Latin.

03:00.683 --> 03:04.668
<i>"Requiem requiem Ultima Ratio Regum."</i>

03:05.554 --> 03:08.046
Claire, the note from the Bone Collector.

03:08.624 --> 03:10.492
What does it mean?

03:10.526 --> 03:14.396
"Rest, rest. The Last Argument of Kings."

03:18.768 --> 03:20.969
The handwriting is the same.

03:21.003 --> 03:22.603
It's him.

03:23.272 --> 03:25.173
- We found him.
- Yes.

03:25.207 --> 03:28.066
He left them a clue and they
didn't even realize.

03:29.026 --> 03:31.346
"Ultima Ratio Regum."

03:31.380 --> 03:34.149
"The Last Argument of Kings"

03:34.183 --> 03:36.084
was engraved on all cannons
produced in France

03:36.118 --> 03:38.827
under the reign of Louis XIV.

03:39.588 --> 03:42.624
'Course. He's telling me
where to find the body.

03:43.165 --> 03:44.692
How does that help us find the body?

03:44.727 --> 03:47.127
This case is Westchester County.

03:47.530 --> 03:50.165
If I recall, Dobbs Ferry
was a strategic encampment

03:50.199 --> 03:51.666
for Washington's troops.

03:51.700 --> 03:53.201
At the start of the Revolutionary War,

03:53.235 --> 03:55.870
France gave
the Continental Army supplies,

03:55.905 --> 03:58.096
including cannons.

03:59.108 --> 04:01.743
Check this out. There's a monument

04:01.777 --> 04:04.846
to that battle in a field
on the edge of town.

04:05.937 --> 04:06.714
So if we're right,

04:06.749 --> 04:09.775
Barry Rothko was buried
somewhere in that field.

04:10.442 --> 04:13.188
And his body could be a clue
to his killer.

04:13.222 --> 04:16.781
Find that body, we find
a link to the Bone Collector.

04:22.298 --> 04:24.099
Let's go. Now. Good boy.

04:24.133 --> 04:25.400
You really think
we're gonna find something

04:25.434 --> 04:27.501
after all this time?

04:29.004 --> 04:31.072
Okay. We're coming up on the monument.

04:33.242 --> 04:35.310
Are you seeing this, Lincoln?

04:35.842 --> 04:36.861
I see it.

04:38.053 --> 04:39.429
It's here.

04:40.716 --> 04:42.584
This has to be it.

04:44.453 --> 04:46.488
Hey, I found something!

04:59.768 --> 05:01.069
The body's gone.

05:01.103 --> 05:03.104
Yeah, this hole's been dug up recently.

05:03.139 --> 05:05.573
A day ago. Maybe two.

05:05.608 --> 05:07.174
Can't get ahead of this guy.

05:07.199 --> 05:09.459
How the hell does he know
what we're doing?

05:12.014 --> 05:13.481
<i>For those who crave living</i>

05:13.516 --> 05:15.216
<i>in a totally managed environment.</i>

05:15.251 --> 05:17.685
Even in the construction phase,
every Vaughn property

05:17.720 --> 05:21.856
is exclusive, private, and secure.

05:21.891 --> 05:24.526
Retrofitted with ultramodern luxury,

05:24.560 --> 05:26.761
and an address that's so desirable,

05:26.795 --> 05:28.997
my family will be the first residents.

05:29.031 --> 05:31.940
Ah, speaking of which...

05:32.501 --> 05:34.769
You'll know my wife Linda, of course.

05:34.803 --> 05:36.671
And this is Simon.

05:36.705 --> 05:39.274
They're here just about every
day, checking on the progress

05:39.308 --> 05:41.783
- of the penthouse.
- Hey, Dad?

05:42.678 --> 05:44.512
If you'll excuse me. I promised my son

05:44.547 --> 05:46.648
a little ice cream, but please,
feel free to look around,

05:46.682 --> 05:48.917
and security will let you out downstairs.

05:49.416 --> 05:51.819
All right. What flavor do you want, pal?

05:56.506 --> 05:57.692
Mr. Vaughn.

05:57.726 --> 05:59.460
This was just delivered here for you.

05:59.495 --> 06:01.296
Here?

06:01.330 --> 06:03.598
Strange, we're not forwarding
the mail here yet.

06:09.405 --> 06:12.063
- Greg, what is this?
- I don't know.

06:13.475 --> 06:15.776
Looks like a digital recorder.

06:16.011 --> 06:17.845
<i>Hello, Greg.</i>

06:17.880 --> 06:20.148
<i>I have a small favor to ask.</i>

06:20.182 --> 06:22.650
<i>But first, let me get your attention.</i>

06:34.897 --> 06:42.541
Synced & corrected by -robtor-
www.addic7ed.com

06:43.902 --> 06:46.003
Search for the Bone Collector's on hold.

06:46.004 --> 06:47.071
Listen to this.

06:47.105 --> 06:49.140
<i>Greg and Linda Vaughn.</i>

06:49.174 --> 06:52.443
<i>You must admit the full extent
of your corruption and greed.</i>

06:52.854 --> 06:56.444
<i>At 6:00 p.m. today,
you're to appear on live TV</i>

06:56.469 --> 06:59.705
<i>from Brooklyn Borough Hall.
The very courthouse in which</i>

06:59.739 --> 07:02.074
<i>you lied and claimed no fault</i>

07:02.108 --> 07:06.143
<i>in the Richmond Hill
apartment fire of 2015.</i>

07:06.144 --> 07:08.845
<i>Admit that the blood of
the people who died there</i>

07:08.880 --> 07:12.516
<i>is on your hands. Obey my instructions,</i>

07:12.550 --> 07:14.952
<i>or another Vaughn property will burn.</i>

07:14.986 --> 07:17.688
<i>And more people will die.</i>

07:19.724 --> 07:20.991
Four of the Vaughn's
investors were killed

07:21.025 --> 07:22.459
in the blast today.

07:22.493 --> 07:24.227
But it could've been a lot worse.

07:24.262 --> 07:26.029
The next building will not be as empty.

07:26.064 --> 07:28.031
Well, maybe we start with
figuring out how the hell

07:28.066 --> 07:29.866
the guy planted the bomb
in the first place.

07:29.901 --> 07:31.735
The site's on complete lockdown.

07:31.769 --> 07:33.837
I mean, key fobs track down
everyone entering and exiting.

07:33.871 --> 07:36.139
Cameras on the outside cover
every possible entrance.

07:36.174 --> 07:38.041
Every employee's accounted
for, and before the Vaughns

07:38.076 --> 07:39.459
and their investors arrived,

07:39.484 --> 07:41.346
the site was completely empty for weeks.

07:41.371 --> 07:43.137
A locked room mystery.

07:46.284 --> 07:49.019
Did you know the first modern
detective story was about

07:49.053 --> 07:52.914
a murder in a locked room
impossible to enter?

07:54.359 --> 07:57.516
- Predates Sherlock Holmes.
- Edgar Allen Poe.

07:57.551 --> 07:58.920
That's right.

08:00.064 --> 08:01.531
The killer was a trained
orangutan who climbed through

08:01.566 --> 08:03.300
a fourth-story window.

08:03.334 --> 08:05.435
So unless the Bronx Zoo
is looking for a primate,

08:05.470 --> 08:07.771
we've got quite a puzzle to solve.

08:07.805 --> 08:10.741
Well, we can start with what he wants.

08:10.775 --> 08:13.410
His demands suggest a clear
vendetta against the Vaughns.

08:13.444 --> 08:15.912
We go after whoever the
evidence tells us to go after.

08:15.947 --> 08:18.582
Well, technically, the
demands on the voice recording

08:18.616 --> 08:20.066
are evidence.

08:20.785 --> 08:23.520
Bomber mentioned the
Richmond Hill apartment fire.

08:23.554 --> 08:26.156
Killed over 40 people...
lotta families filed lawsuits.

08:26.190 --> 08:28.325
Yeah, but the Vaughns were
cleared of any negligence.

08:28.359 --> 08:30.127
Fire was sufficiently ruled accidental.

08:30.161 --> 08:32.729
Well, our guy's not buying
the official story.

08:32.764 --> 08:34.731
Which means we need to find
every family member and person

08:34.765 --> 08:36.875
with a motive. But first...

08:37.534 --> 08:39.503
Crime scene.

08:39.919 --> 08:41.405
Okay, got it.

08:47.045 --> 08:50.080
<i>Good. Walk the grid one step at a time</i>

08:50.114 --> 08:51.448
using all your senses.

08:53.384 --> 08:54.803
<i>Ughh.</i>

08:54.838 --> 08:56.518
<i>Glad I wore my street clothes for this.</i>

08:56.552 --> 08:58.221
Necklace to the left.

09:06.130 --> 09:08.965
<i>It's hard to tell what's
evidence and what's not.</i>

09:09.000 --> 09:11.902
Everything is burnt to a crisp.

09:11.936 --> 09:13.437
This building's current renovation

09:13.471 --> 09:15.439
works to our advantage.
They've already removed

09:15.473 --> 09:18.008
the flooring and walls,
which likely had decades

09:18.042 --> 09:19.810
of wear and tear and dust

09:19.844 --> 09:22.145
and the skin cells of thousands
of people on them.

09:22.504 --> 09:24.481
<i>What's a little fire
compared to all that?</i>

09:24.515 --> 09:26.917
Three cheers for gentrification.

09:26.951 --> 09:28.819
Head to the far corner behind you.

09:28.853 --> 09:30.454
If the debris landed there,
we need to find

09:30.488 --> 09:32.055
<i>where it came from.</i>

09:32.356 --> 09:35.792
I'm no expert, but that looks
like a point of origin to me.

09:35.827 --> 09:38.395
Well, I am an expert, and yes, it does.

09:41.132 --> 09:45.001
And that looks like pieces
of bomb shrapnel.

09:45.036 --> 09:46.970
<i>Move closer, please.</i>

09:50.441 --> 09:51.608
Huh.

09:51.642 --> 09:53.276
<i>This is odd.</i>

09:53.311 --> 09:55.453
Show me the other side again.

10:01.152 --> 10:03.019
Our bomber left us something behind

10:03.054 --> 10:04.921
that might lead us to him.

10:04.956 --> 10:07.691
Look, I was testing the soil
from the empty grave.

10:07.725 --> 10:09.893
The Bone Collector took the
body, but he may have left us

10:09.927 --> 10:11.928
- his DNA.
- First, go to the lab,

10:11.963 --> 10:13.730
run the trace Amelia
found in the high-rise.

10:13.765 --> 10:17.601
Blood evidence, DNA, prints.
Find a link to the bomber.

10:20.238 --> 10:21.738
Felix.

10:21.773 --> 10:23.607
Running all complaints
against the Vaughns.

10:23.641 --> 10:25.108
It's a long list.

10:25.710 --> 10:28.612
Look, whether or not she finds the
Bone Collector's DNA, it's him.

10:28.646 --> 10:30.580
- Has to be.
- Agreed.

10:30.615 --> 10:32.849
Killed Barry Rothko and
left him there 30 years.

10:32.884 --> 10:35.018
Until we sent for the case
files from Westchester.

10:35.052 --> 10:37.654
Yes, someone tipped him.
Someone on the inside.

10:37.688 --> 10:39.356
- Who?
- I don't know.

10:39.390 --> 10:41.124
I have Internal Affairs on it.

10:41.159 --> 10:42.961
Well, they should be able
to identify a data breach.

10:42.995 --> 10:44.095
Who would do that?

10:44.129 --> 10:46.696
Someone trading information for cash.
Someone with a vulnerability.

10:49.033 --> 10:50.216
Or maybe...

10:51.402 --> 10:53.203
the Bone Collector is another cop.

10:54.772 --> 10:57.274
He's meticulous, knowledgeable
about forensics...

10:57.308 --> 10:59.392
Knowledgeable about you.

11:00.268 --> 11:02.979
I know this may come as a
surprise, but you have ruffled

11:03.014 --> 11:04.681
a few feathers over the years, Lincoln.

11:04.715 --> 11:06.383
I've been over that list
of names in my head

11:06.417 --> 11:08.752
a thousand times.
I can practically recite

11:08.786 --> 11:11.922
the NYPD active roster by heart.

11:12.280 --> 11:15.392
But right now, there's nothing
we can do about that.

11:17.361 --> 11:19.287
A bomber's threatening our city.

11:20.031 --> 11:21.832
And there's a very literal ticking clock.

11:21.866 --> 11:23.433
Bone Collector takes a back seat.

11:23.467 --> 11:28.729
Not necessarily. Insight often
arises when the mind is at rest.

11:29.279 --> 11:32.383
You know how Einstein struck
upon the theory of relativity?

11:33.635 --> 11:35.445
Staring out a window.

11:35.479 --> 11:37.614
You want us to stare out a window?

11:38.139 --> 11:42.085
My point is, answers will
come when they're ready.

11:42.602 --> 11:43.987
In the meantime,

11:45.146 --> 11:47.991
let's find what the Vaughns
have to tell us.

11:48.025 --> 11:51.027
So nobody's made any explicit
threats against you recently?

11:51.062 --> 11:54.130
No. Nothing out of the ordinary.

11:54.165 --> 11:56.399
But we get threats all the time.

11:56.434 --> 11:58.068
Because of the Richmond Hill fire

11:58.102 --> 12:00.036
like the bomber mentioned on the tape?

12:00.071 --> 12:02.939
We weren't responsible for
the Richmond Hill fire any more

12:02.974 --> 12:05.342
than we were responsible
for the one this morning.

12:05.875 --> 12:08.845
And our buildings that this
madman is threatening to bomb...

12:09.212 --> 12:12.382
three of them have
free rec centers for children,

12:12.416 --> 12:15.285
charter schools, a free private library.

12:15.319 --> 12:18.138
We're not corporate monsters,
all right? We...

12:21.259 --> 12:23.727
- We run a family business.
- Please.

12:23.761 --> 12:26.437
- What can we do to help?
- Well...

12:27.064 --> 12:28.698
if it comes down to it,

12:28.733 --> 12:30.834
would you be willing to do
what he's asking for?

12:30.868 --> 12:32.602
Go on television?

12:32.637 --> 12:34.671
And publicly take
responsibility for something

12:34.705 --> 12:37.173
we tried ye... for years
to clear our name of?

12:37.208 --> 12:38.743
Come on, guys.

12:38.778 --> 12:41.044
Thought there was a rule against
negotiating with terrorists.

12:41.078 --> 12:42.545
Well, it's kind of a unique
situation, don't you think?

12:42.580 --> 12:44.581
I mean, we have half the city hostage

12:44.615 --> 12:46.816
and no hostage taker to negotiate with.

12:46.851 --> 12:49.786
- Greg, maybe we need to...
- We have every faith

12:49.820 --> 12:51.421
that you'll find him.

12:58.896 --> 13:00.096
Hey.

13:01.799 --> 13:05.402
Simon, right? I'm Officer Sachs.

13:05.436 --> 13:07.537
Sorry, he's not himself today.

13:07.571 --> 13:10.064
Please, do not apologize.

13:10.641 --> 13:12.650
You've both been through a lot.

13:16.414 --> 13:21.326
Look, I know what happened
today was a very big deal.

13:21.752 --> 13:25.496
And people are asking you
a lot of scary questions.

13:26.624 --> 13:28.708
But it isn't your fault.

13:29.527 --> 13:33.713
Trust me, I've been
in your situation before.

13:34.432 --> 13:36.766
I heard the recordings.

13:36.801 --> 13:39.803
He said he's gonna do this again,

13:39.837 --> 13:42.339
and he's coming for us next time.

13:42.889 --> 13:46.434
Well, what I think is that
he's trying to scare you.

13:47.678 --> 13:51.081
But what I know is that
we're gonna catch him

13:51.115 --> 13:54.141
before he hurts you or anyone else.

13:54.567 --> 13:55.985
I promise.

13:57.621 --> 13:59.456
Simon, sweetie.

14:04.161 --> 14:06.621
Can you really make that promise?

14:08.199 --> 14:12.335
It's important children have
reassurance in times of trauma.

14:12.370 --> 14:14.295
What about the rest of us?

14:20.044 --> 14:21.845
I guarantee you'll be caught.

14:24.482 --> 14:27.384
Well, you'd say anything
to get out of this.

14:27.418 --> 14:29.252
Ever since we moved back to New York,

14:29.286 --> 14:31.229
you've been off your game.

14:32.480 --> 14:35.775
You made the one mistake you
could never afford to make.

14:37.443 --> 14:39.295
You let me find those photos.

14:39.868 --> 14:41.698
I didn't let you find anything.

14:43.601 --> 14:46.236
Any psychologist would say
that that was a sublimated

14:46.270 --> 14:49.873
desire to be caught.
So that I would stop you.

14:49.907 --> 14:51.908
It was a fluke.

14:51.942 --> 14:53.910
But it's done, and now I'm gonna fix it.

14:53.944 --> 14:55.278
And if you could,
you would've done it already,

14:55.312 --> 14:57.630
but you can't.

14:58.149 --> 15:00.617
'Cause you know that if you
kill me, it'll torture you.

15:00.651 --> 15:02.343
You'll spiral.

15:03.421 --> 15:05.655
Whatever you are,

15:06.889 --> 15:08.825
what we had was real.

15:10.061 --> 15:11.811
You love me.

15:15.666 --> 15:19.669
You let me live, and you disappear.

15:19.703 --> 15:21.271
I don't want to disappear.

15:21.305 --> 15:23.373
Your life is over even if I'm dead.

15:23.407 --> 15:25.075
People know us.

15:25.109 --> 15:27.343
You'll have to concoct some story.

15:27.378 --> 15:30.513
Well, you decided to spend
some time in Brussels

15:30.548 --> 15:32.749
where you did your graduate work.

15:32.783 --> 15:34.784
We've been having issues...

15:34.819 --> 15:37.545
You can't lie with this
eating at your core.

15:43.561 --> 15:47.530
Find a calm place, like Colorado.

15:48.014 --> 15:49.666
You were happy in Colorado.

15:50.058 --> 15:52.352
I was happy in Colorado.

15:53.838 --> 15:55.772
We were happy.

16:00.578 --> 16:02.812
Peter... I... I...

16:02.847 --> 16:06.116
If you kill me, your life
is over, but if you run,

16:06.150 --> 16:12.188
then... the Bone Collector
can live in infamous shadow.

16:12.223 --> 16:13.890
Hidden.

16:14.207 --> 16:16.959
You live your life and I live mine.

16:18.028 --> 16:21.547
Trust me. Peter, I can help you.

16:21.932 --> 16:24.167
Even now, I can help you get away.

16:29.157 --> 16:30.600
Give me something, give me something...

16:30.601 --> 16:32.235
Lincoln, time for your PT.

16:36.759 --> 16:38.245
You're not making it any easier to focus

16:38.279 --> 16:40.611
on catching a bomber.
I have to figure out

16:40.638 --> 16:42.539
- how he got past security.
- You were up all night

16:42.574 --> 16:44.341
working on it, Lincoln. You don't think

16:44.375 --> 16:46.143
- there's a price to be paid?
- I'm fine.

16:46.572 --> 16:49.346
You're fine because
I make sure you're fine.

16:49.380 --> 16:51.615
Because I endure you going
through the motions

16:51.649 --> 16:54.251
of protesting, when all along,
you know what's best.

16:54.285 --> 16:56.220
Now you're a profiler like Amelia?

16:56.254 --> 16:58.388
Profiling? Please.

16:58.423 --> 17:00.724
I know you better than you know yourself.

17:00.758 --> 17:02.547
You know it's true.

17:04.596 --> 17:05.967
You're right.

17:08.299 --> 17:11.638
So... how are you?

17:13.182 --> 17:16.769
Yes. I asked how you are doing.

17:17.308 --> 17:19.105
How's your treatment coming?

17:20.857 --> 17:22.613
I listen to my tapes,

17:23.067 --> 17:25.482
do relaxation exercises,

17:25.778 --> 17:28.990
and then when I even think
about stepping outside,

17:29.621 --> 17:31.659
the agoraphobia takes over.

17:33.644 --> 17:35.078
Give it time.

17:35.246 --> 17:36.994
I know.

17:37.623 --> 17:39.663
I forget about it
when I'm focused on you.

17:39.697 --> 17:41.632
Which is why I let you distract me

17:41.666 --> 17:44.935
- from the urgent task at hand.
- You have a team, Lincoln.

17:44.969 --> 17:47.137
Even when you're doing this,
your team is working.

17:47.171 --> 17:48.468
Eureka!

17:50.074 --> 17:51.875
Saved by the bell.

17:51.910 --> 17:53.510
Did she really just say, "Eureka"?

17:53.545 --> 17:56.446
You were right about the blue material.

17:56.481 --> 17:58.982
Definitely a part of a canvas
bag, and the purple and yellow

17:59.017 --> 18:02.019
powder are tiny pieces
of spray-painted cement.

18:02.053 --> 18:03.921
- Like from graffiti?
- Exactly.

18:03.955 --> 18:06.523
Store bought spray paint sold everywhere.

18:06.558 --> 18:08.692
Hard to track,
but that's not the cool part.

18:08.726 --> 18:11.295
The cool part is that the pores
are full of bacteria.

18:11.329 --> 18:12.633
Bacteria?

18:13.197 --> 18:15.578
You mean, like, he put the bag
down in the men's room, or...

18:16.334 --> 18:18.936
You were about to tell us what
special kind of bacteria.

18:18.970 --> 18:21.204
- I'm sorry, go ahead.
- Bacillus subtilis.

18:21.239 --> 18:24.074
Bacillus subtilis. Isn't that...

18:24.108 --> 18:25.842
In your notebooks, yes.

18:26.522 --> 18:28.382
Yeah, that's what I thought.

18:28.980 --> 18:31.782
Years ago, the military
dispersed bacillus subtilis

18:31.816 --> 18:34.618
through various tunnels under
New York to test how disease

18:34.652 --> 18:36.432
spreads underground.

18:38.267 --> 18:39.816
And one of those tunnels
just happens to be

18:39.851 --> 18:41.491
a mecca for graffiti artists.

18:41.526 --> 18:42.960
You're thinking of Freedom Tunnel.

18:42.994 --> 18:45.441
Yeah, the spray paint, the bacteria.

18:46.831 --> 18:48.999
Those bombs were in the
Freedom Tunnel before they were

18:49.033 --> 18:51.501
- stuck onto the building.
- Okay.

18:51.536 --> 18:53.303
So what are we looking
for when we get there?

18:53.338 --> 18:56.640
If I had to guess... more bombs.

18:59.677 --> 19:02.045
<i>Years ago, I made my own
detailed maps of these tunnels.</i>

19:02.080 --> 19:04.615
And... why?

19:04.649 --> 19:05.983
'Cause you never know
what you're going to need

19:06.017 --> 19:08.047
until the moment you need it most.

19:08.753 --> 19:10.520
<i>Hmm. Duck.</i>

19:12.223 --> 19:14.428
Show-off.

19:16.094 --> 19:17.557
All right, veer left.

19:18.262 --> 19:21.143
<i>Okay, keep walking...</i>

19:22.033 --> 19:23.734
Wait, stop.

19:23.768 --> 19:25.940
<i>That mural to your right.</i>

19:26.604 --> 19:28.205
That's not street art.

19:28.239 --> 19:30.273
<i>That's kind of a matter of opinion.</i>

19:30.308 --> 19:32.743
<i>No, it's a sloppy attempt by
an amateur to hide something.</i>

19:32.777 --> 19:34.365
It's a door.

19:36.648 --> 19:39.449
Watch out... fingerprints. Use a cloth.

19:39.484 --> 19:40.997
Ready?

19:44.322 --> 19:45.856
Is this on your map, Lincoln?

19:45.890 --> 19:47.295
<i>Okay, wait.</i>

19:47.892 --> 19:50.214
Just Amelia... can't risk
corrupting the scene.

19:53.798 --> 19:57.000
That explains the dust
on the bag fragments.

20:01.072 --> 20:02.685
Careful, Amelia.

20:14.919 --> 20:17.087
Guys? Hey, what did you do?

20:17.121 --> 20:18.522
I don't know, we... we didn't do it!

20:18.556 --> 20:19.990
<i>It slammed on its own.</i>

20:20.464 --> 20:22.365
<i>I'm locked in.</i>

20:23.233 --> 20:25.082
Hang on, hang on.

20:28.199 --> 20:29.933
Oh, he must've rigged it.

20:31.869 --> 20:34.705
It's a bomb. <i>It's armed.</i>

20:34.739 --> 20:37.674
Uh, any ideas here, guys?

20:37.709 --> 20:39.176
Gotta find a way to get this door open.

20:39.210 --> 20:41.445
No, no, no! I might trigger the bomb.

20:41.479 --> 20:43.413
<i>Lincoln, come on, you gotta
think of something else.</i>

20:43.448 --> 20:46.016
Get the bomb squad down here now.

20:51.689 --> 20:53.356
Okay, okay.

20:53.391 --> 20:54.858
<i>Amelia, talk to me.</i>

20:54.892 --> 20:58.228
I got this. I got this.

20:58.262 --> 21:01.331
I'm not this mind. I'm not this body.

21:01.365 --> 21:03.333
Amelia, I can't hear you.
What are you saying?

21:03.367 --> 21:06.503
A mantra. A coping
mechanism for her PTSD.

21:06.537 --> 21:08.004
Okay.

21:08.039 --> 21:10.753
<i>Amelia, I'm with you.</i>

21:11.676 --> 21:13.376
Lincoln.

21:13.411 --> 21:15.512
<i>Please tell me you can
get me out of here.</i>

21:15.546 --> 21:18.515
<i>Lincoln, wait.
You've defused a bomb before...</i>

21:18.549 --> 21:20.283
<i>the day you got hurt at the power plant.</i>

21:20.318 --> 21:21.651
But I had the Bone Collector's riddles

21:21.686 --> 21:23.453
to guide me. I don't actually know

21:23.488 --> 21:25.422
the first thing about
how to defuse a bomb.

21:25.456 --> 21:27.424
<i>Okay, 1:18 left.</i>

21:27.458 --> 21:29.159
Mike, bomb squad's talking to me.

21:29.193 --> 21:31.394
Come on, Lincoln.

21:31.429 --> 21:33.363
But I do know how to make one.

21:33.397 --> 21:36.028
<i>On the table to your left,
there's a jar of red powder.</i>

21:39.604 --> 21:41.471
<i>- Got it.
- Okay, then take the</i>

21:41.506 --> 21:42.973
aluminum foil that's covering
the paint can, and lay it flat.

21:43.007 --> 21:45.609
- Got it.
<i>- Shiny side down.</i>

21:47.478 --> 21:49.746
- Okay.
<i>- Grab the magnesium.</i>

21:49.781 --> 21:51.548
<i>The what?</i>

21:51.582 --> 21:53.750
<i>The coiled-up metal.
You see it, don't you?</i>

21:53.785 --> 21:56.023
Great, I'm supposed to make
a bomb out of this?

21:57.054 --> 22:00.090
Put the ribbon on the foil, lay it flat.

22:00.636 --> 22:02.225
All right, good.

22:02.260 --> 22:03.894
<i>Uh...</i>

22:03.928 --> 22:06.062
Now spread the red powder
as evenly as you can

22:06.097 --> 22:07.518
<i>across the foil.</i>

22:08.699 --> 22:10.534
- Okay.
- Roll up the foil

22:10.568 --> 22:12.302
with the powder inside
and the ribbon inside.

22:12.336 --> 22:13.870
<i>Running out of time.</i>

22:15.985 --> 22:17.641
28 seconds.

22:17.675 --> 22:19.309
<i>Leave some of the ribbon
sticking out like a fuse.</i>

22:19.343 --> 22:21.311
You've just made a thermite charge.

22:21.345 --> 22:24.781
Wrap it around the door handle,
light the fuse, and step back.

22:24.816 --> 22:27.184
Move away from the door!

22:35.426 --> 22:36.827
Let's go, let's go!

22:36.861 --> 22:38.662
- Gotta get out of here!
- Let's go, now!

22:38.696 --> 22:40.330
- We gotta go!
- Wait! The evidence!

22:40.364 --> 22:42.365
- Amelia!
- Come on, come on, come on!

22:42.400 --> 22:43.500
Coming...

22:47.572 --> 22:49.518
Amelia!

22:54.540 --> 22:56.441
<i>Amelia!</i>

22:59.345 --> 23:01.546
<i>Lincoln, I'm here. I'm good.</i>

23:02.850 --> 23:04.916
You got me out of there.

23:06.552 --> 23:08.287
And I got you evidence.

23:10.223 --> 23:12.123
Good job.

23:15.828 --> 23:17.362
Thanks.

23:18.531 --> 23:19.764
- Amelia.
- Yeah?

23:19.799 --> 23:22.100
- Can I see you a minute?
- Yeah.

23:25.484 --> 23:29.787
- Everything okay?
- No, no, it's not okay.

23:29.976 --> 23:31.852
Running back in there like that...

23:32.645 --> 23:34.230
that was crazy.

23:35.081 --> 23:36.548
- Crazy?
- I mean, seriously,

23:36.582 --> 23:38.884
- what were you thinking?
- I was thinking

23:38.918 --> 23:40.352
what we're all thinking every day...

23:40.386 --> 23:42.287
get Lincoln the evidence he needs.

23:42.321 --> 23:45.323
And it was your job, your job alone,

23:45.358 --> 23:47.368
to be the hero?

23:48.094 --> 23:52.030
No, it's all of our jobs
to do what we can

23:52.064 --> 23:54.833
to find this bomber and stop
any more bombs from detonating

23:54.867 --> 23:56.568
before we lose anyone else.

23:56.602 --> 23:58.703
I get it, but you weren't
brought on to this team

23:58.738 --> 24:01.239
to be as reckless
and impulsive as Lincoln.

24:01.274 --> 24:03.541
You don't help anyone if you get hurt.

24:03.576 --> 24:05.810
That's not fair.

24:05.845 --> 24:09.390
Me losing a second partner...
that wouldn't be fair.

24:10.483 --> 24:13.351
Okay? So congratulations
on saving the evidence.

24:13.386 --> 24:15.086
Maybe next time, take a minute and think

24:15.121 --> 24:17.231
before risking everything.

24:20.960 --> 24:23.461
The wire from the bomb room
is likely traceable.

24:23.496 --> 24:25.664
Here's a serial number... I don't
know if we have time, though.

24:25.698 --> 24:27.365
Well, give it to Felix, just in case.

24:27.400 --> 24:29.634
Kinda busy with the sound file right now.

24:29.669 --> 24:33.338
- Oh? What sound file?
- The bomber's voice recording.

24:33.372 --> 24:35.640
Digital recordings
don't necessarily record

24:35.675 --> 24:37.609
over old information.

24:37.643 --> 24:40.045
It's there, if you know how to get it.

24:40.079 --> 24:41.947
How long will that take? Because we are

24:41.981 --> 24:43.815
42 minutes away
from the bomber's deadline.

24:43.849 --> 24:46.184
So either the Vaughns
grow a heart of gold,

24:46.218 --> 24:48.653
or we need to find something
very, very quickly.

24:50.836 --> 24:52.904
I'm gonna be straight
with you... if you can't buy us

24:52.929 --> 24:54.563
the time we need, people are gonna die.

24:54.660 --> 24:56.094
Now, you're here already,

24:56.128 --> 24:57.495
please just do what the guy wants.

24:57.530 --> 24:59.523
So that's why you brought us here, huh?

25:00.266 --> 25:01.933
- Mrs. Vaughn, we...
- No, no, we... we're united

25:01.968 --> 25:04.035
on this, Detective, okay?

25:04.070 --> 25:06.604
I'm not going out on camera
and putting everything

25:06.639 --> 25:08.340
- I built at risk.
- Enough!

25:08.374 --> 25:09.950
Greg.

25:10.609 --> 25:13.044
You know very well why you
don't want to say those things.

25:13.079 --> 25:15.706
- Careful, Linda.
- Because they're true!

25:18.117 --> 25:20.652
Because we made terrible mistakes

25:20.686 --> 25:23.455
and we covered them up, and we
pretended they didn't happen.

25:23.489 --> 25:26.624
But we made those choices.

25:29.829 --> 25:31.347
We'll do it.

25:32.231 --> 25:34.600
But not until Simon is far away.

25:35.134 --> 25:36.735
For all we know,
this person's entire plan

25:36.769 --> 25:38.436
is to bomb the press conference.

25:38.471 --> 25:40.438
We can take him somewhere
safe immediately.

25:40.473 --> 25:42.507
We have a place for times like this.

25:42.541 --> 25:46.612
U- Unlisted address, extra
security, not in our name.

25:47.179 --> 25:49.080
I'll have our people take him there.

25:49.115 --> 25:50.949
Thank you.

25:54.253 --> 25:56.888
Remember the first time I saw you?

25:58.691 --> 26:01.659
- In that bar? O'Bryant's?
- Yeah.

26:01.694 --> 26:03.921
That guy was such a jerk.

26:05.197 --> 26:08.166
By all accounts, you should've
decked him.

26:08.200 --> 26:09.969
That's why I sat down.

26:11.237 --> 26:14.005
- You thought I needed saving?
- No.

26:14.040 --> 26:17.226
I admired your restraint.

26:17.743 --> 26:20.678
- What all men wanna hear.
- No, I...

26:20.713 --> 26:24.400
I said what I first thought,
before I sat down.

26:25.859 --> 26:28.153
I wanted to punch that guy myself.

26:29.021 --> 26:30.889
But...

26:30.923 --> 26:34.292
Then when he left, and we were talking,

26:34.326 --> 26:39.081
and I sensed that
there was something more.

26:39.957 --> 26:42.986
You, uh, had this...

26:44.537 --> 26:47.923
Just this basic goodness.

26:51.911 --> 26:53.220
So...

26:54.880 --> 26:57.141
I've disillusioned you?

26:59.268 --> 27:02.854
No, I... I think you
are the man that I know.

27:02.888 --> 27:04.440
Partly.

27:05.858 --> 27:08.893
Yeah. Partly.

27:14.834 --> 27:17.735
You know what I was thinking
about before you sat down?

27:20.072 --> 27:22.340
I was thinking about
which bone I could remove

27:22.374 --> 27:24.418
to hurt the most.

27:27.279 --> 27:30.507
The jerk. The guy at the bar.

27:31.842 --> 27:36.287
But I forgot about him
as soon as you sat down.

27:39.859 --> 27:41.977
You do soothe me.

27:45.231 --> 27:47.149
You always have.

27:53.205 --> 27:54.865
Whatever happens,

27:55.708 --> 27:58.109
I hope you don't lose the good parts.

28:02.281 --> 28:04.249
I'd be scared to think what would happen

28:04.283 --> 28:08.045
if the Bone Collector's all you become.

28:13.526 --> 28:16.027
You shouldn't have found the photographs.

29:07.341 --> 29:09.109
<i>I got something.</i>

29:09.143 --> 29:11.628
The bomber bought the wires
at Joe Brothers' Hardware

29:11.629 --> 29:13.229
in Brooklyn. Here's the catalogue.

29:13.264 --> 29:14.747
- Good job.
- I got something better.

29:14.781 --> 29:16.607
Ooh.

29:16.642 --> 29:19.640
There's another recording underneath
the bomber's original message.

29:19.675 --> 29:21.774
It's only eight seconds long, but...

29:21.808 --> 29:23.203
let's see.

29:24.044 --> 29:26.245
<i>Testing, testing, one, two, three.</i>

29:26.280 --> 29:27.813
<i>Hey, you on break?</i>

29:27.848 --> 29:29.585
<i>I'll meet you on site in ten minutes.</i>

29:30.751 --> 29:33.046
A construction site.

29:33.620 --> 29:35.955
I'll see if I can isolate
the noise in the background.

29:35.989 --> 29:37.990
Okay.

29:41.995 --> 29:44.297
- What... what do you think?
- I know that sound.

29:46.466 --> 29:48.968
- You said Brooklyn, right?
- Yeah.

30:02.482 --> 30:05.151
Parrots. In 1967, a single shipment

30:05.185 --> 30:06.452
of Quaker parrots from Argentina

30:06.486 --> 30:08.571
escaped from JFK Airport.

30:08.572 --> 30:10.372
Now there's an entire colony of them,

30:10.407 --> 30:13.503
primarily in the area
surrounding Brooklyn College.

30:13.843 --> 30:15.578
Felix, I need an employee list

30:15.612 --> 30:17.546
of any active construction sites.

30:17.581 --> 30:19.915
- Yeah, Brooklyn College, yup.
- And cross reference the names

30:19.950 --> 30:21.550
with the victims of
the Richmond Hill fire.

30:21.585 --> 30:24.053
We're looking for demolition
experts or...

30:24.087 --> 30:27.523
Safety inspector. Arnold Massey.

30:27.557 --> 30:30.593
He filed an affidavit against
the Vaughns five years ago.

30:30.627 --> 30:32.528
Accused them of covering up
safety violations.

30:32.562 --> 30:34.997
Well, that sounds like our guy so far.

30:35.031 --> 30:36.832
Ready for this?

30:36.866 --> 30:39.488
Massey's wife and son were
killed in an apartment fire.

30:39.869 --> 30:42.805
- Richmond Hill?
- Uh, no, no.

30:42.839 --> 30:45.140
But he said it's the reason why
he became a safety inspector

30:45.175 --> 30:47.343
and why he "urges the Vaughns to avoid

30:47.377 --> 30:49.945
a preventable tragedy of Richmond Hill."

30:49.980 --> 30:51.780
- He tried to warn them.
- He also tried to file

30:51.815 --> 30:54.550
a class action suit
after the fact, but Vaughns

30:54.584 --> 30:57.152
paid off the families,
sued Massey into submission.

30:57.187 --> 30:59.154
Call Sellitto.
Tell him we found the bomber.

31:08.465 --> 31:10.699
NYPD! We're coming in!

31:13.270 --> 31:15.471
Arnold Massey!

31:17.974 --> 31:20.195
Get down on the ground!
Let me see your hands!

31:21.678 --> 31:23.030
Where are the other bombs, Massey?

31:23.065 --> 31:26.181
Doesn't matter... it's too late
to stop what's coming to them.

31:26.216 --> 31:29.818
<i>Good evening. My name is Linda Vaughn,</i>

31:29.853 --> 31:31.553
<i>and I'd like to make a confession.</i>

31:31.588 --> 31:34.334
Get him up. Get him up.

31:34.891 --> 31:38.167
There. You got what you wanted.
Now you hold up your end

31:38.201 --> 31:41.764
of the bargain and tell us
where those other bombs are.

31:44.734 --> 31:46.096
Lawyer.

31:46.936 --> 31:48.771
- Take him out.
- Let's go.

31:49.349 --> 31:52.007
I hope you've got something,
'cause Massey's not talking.

31:52.042 --> 31:54.243
The bomb squad's swept every
Vaughn property twice

31:54.277 --> 31:56.512
and found nothing.
Courthouse secure as well.

31:56.546 --> 31:58.080
- Could he be bluffing?
- Hmm.

31:58.114 --> 31:59.782
Maybe there aren't any more bombs.

31:59.816 --> 32:01.950
He just killed four innocent
people just to prove

32:01.985 --> 32:04.420
to the Vaughns he could
get to them anywhere.

32:04.454 --> 32:06.555
- I don't think he's bluffing.
- But I just don't see how

32:06.589 --> 32:08.857
Massey got past security
at the construction site.

32:08.892 --> 32:11.627
Here's the footage. He's not on it.

32:11.661 --> 32:13.262
No, he isn't.

32:13.296 --> 32:15.264
Then why wouldn't he say he's innocent?

32:15.298 --> 32:16.752
The locked room mystery.

32:19.602 --> 32:21.403
I can't believe I didn't
realize it before,

32:21.438 --> 32:24.373
- it's so insultingly simple.
- Lincoln?

32:24.407 --> 32:26.141
Massey didn't need to sneak
his bomb into the building.

32:26.176 --> 32:27.676
Someone else did it for him.

32:27.711 --> 32:29.912
<i>But how did they get past security?</i>

32:29.946 --> 32:31.413
We're looking for someone
who seems to have a reason

32:31.448 --> 32:33.449
to be there. Felix?

32:33.483 --> 32:35.818
Search Massey's file on
the class action lawsuit

32:35.852 --> 32:37.720
- he tried to organize.
- But we've already been

32:37.754 --> 32:39.136
through all the victims
of the Richmond Hill fire.

32:39.171 --> 32:41.324
Maybe Massey reached out to
families from other accidents

32:41.358 --> 32:43.325
on other Vaughn properties.

32:43.360 --> 32:45.260
You're looking for surviving
a family member with

32:45.295 --> 32:47.629
just as much motive against
the Vaughns as Massey has.

32:47.664 --> 32:49.236
Someone who found a way inside.

32:49.271 --> 32:51.834
What about someone who lost a child?

32:51.868 --> 32:54.636
- Alma Gutierrez.
- Oh, my God... the nanny.

32:54.671 --> 32:56.605
Mother of 12-year-old Matthew.

32:56.639 --> 32:58.218
Her son died in a fire in an apartment

32:58.253 --> 32:59.808
owned by the Vaughns in Queens.

32:59.843 --> 33:01.677
<i>She's with Simon night and day.</i>

33:01.711 --> 33:04.480
She could've walked past
any security at any property,

33:04.514 --> 33:06.482
and they'd wave her right through.

33:11.354 --> 33:13.255
<i>I don't understand.</i>

33:13.289 --> 33:15.257
<i>Couldn't she have just killed
the Vaughns at any time?</i>

33:15.291 --> 33:17.493
<i>That's not what she wants.</i>

33:18.021 --> 33:20.295
She wants their son to die the same way.

33:20.816 --> 33:22.631
We gotta get to Simon.

33:22.665 --> 33:25.367
Come on, <i>mi niÃ±o. Let's go.</i>

33:27.737 --> 33:29.271
All clear... we'll be out here
if you need us.

33:29.305 --> 33:31.451
I'm sure we'll be just fine.

33:37.819 --> 33:39.126
Simon.

34:13.726 --> 34:16.395
- Turn around, turn around.
- Hands up.

34:23.070 --> 34:24.469
<i>I've got eyes on the nanny.</i>

34:35.949 --> 34:39.880
Hannah? Why don't you let Simon go?

34:39.916 --> 34:43.851
You. You're the one
who makes stupid promises.

34:43.887 --> 34:46.522
I used to make promises
like that to my son.

34:46.556 --> 34:49.658
He died, anyway.
Just like we're about to!

34:49.692 --> 34:51.947
Okay, we're leaving. We're leaving.

34:53.830 --> 34:56.431
Okay, Hannah? Nobody has to die.

34:56.466 --> 35:00.369
Not you, not Simon. We can work this out.

35:04.841 --> 35:07.142
- No, I'm staying.
- What? No, you're not.

35:07.176 --> 35:11.780
Yes. Look, she's a mother
who lost a son... she's grieving.

35:11.814 --> 35:13.815
She doesn't want to do this.

35:13.850 --> 35:15.551
She just needs someone
to talk her out of it.

35:15.585 --> 35:17.753
Here we are again, you
putting yourself in harm's way.

35:17.787 --> 35:19.388
I'm trying to keep Simon alive.

35:19.422 --> 35:21.750
We talked about this, Amelia.

35:23.359 --> 35:25.661
- I made him a promise.
- You made him a promise?

35:25.695 --> 35:27.996
Seriously? Lincoln, say something

35:28.031 --> 35:29.765
to talk her out of this.

35:29.799 --> 35:33.068
Are you sure, Amelia?
She doesn't like you very much.

35:33.102 --> 35:34.741
I'm sure.

35:37.106 --> 35:39.996
Trust me, Sellitto.

35:45.615 --> 35:49.089
I'm coming in. I'm dropping my weapon.

35:53.423 --> 35:55.693
I'm not leaving without Simon.

35:55.727 --> 35:59.294
- No, they took my son away
- I know.

35:59.329 --> 36:02.898
And now, they're gonna get
what's coming to them.

36:02.932 --> 36:04.533
Doesn't sound like you talking.

36:04.567 --> 36:06.735
That sounds like Arnold Massey talking.

36:06.769 --> 36:09.859
Hmm? Am I right?

36:11.069 --> 36:12.741
Did he convince you to do this?

36:12.775 --> 36:15.844
<i>He told me the truth.</i>

36:15.878 --> 36:18.113
<i>The Vaughns knew.</i>

36:18.147 --> 36:20.449
They could've prevented my boy's death,

36:20.483 --> 36:22.818
and the law will never punish them!

36:22.852 --> 36:25.821
This is the only way to make them pay!

36:25.855 --> 36:28.824
The only way to make them listen!

36:28.858 --> 36:32.694
Don't come any closer, okay?

36:32.729 --> 36:34.997
Okay. Hannah, you're right.

36:35.510 --> 36:37.633
The Vaughns are to blame
for this, and they should pay.

36:37.667 --> 36:40.502
They deserve to feel all of the pain

36:40.536 --> 36:42.892
that you felt to lose everything.

36:44.144 --> 36:46.875
But I want you to look at that
boy in your arms, right now.

36:46.909 --> 36:50.312
- You take a good look at him.
- He'll grow up

36:50.695 --> 36:52.396
to be just like them,

36:52.430 --> 36:57.001
thinking the world owes him everything.

36:57.035 --> 36:58.658
<i>My Matthew...</i>

36:59.652 --> 37:03.888
didn't deserve to die.

37:03.968 --> 37:07.171
Hannah, I'm sorry for whatever I did.

37:07.352 --> 37:09.887
- I'm sorry, really sorry.
- Simon, it's okay.

37:09.912 --> 37:11.746
It's not your fault.

37:11.771 --> 37:15.050
Hannah, your Matthew...

37:15.980 --> 37:18.178
he sounds like a sweet boy.

37:18.740 --> 37:23.143
What if he was here, right now,
watching you?

37:23.395 --> 37:25.329
You think he would want this?

37:32.430 --> 37:34.431
Please, Hannah.

37:34.456 --> 37:38.726
My baby...

37:43.955 --> 37:46.590
Matthew, Matthew, I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry.

37:46.615 --> 37:48.283
Down, get down! Down on the ground!

37:48.308 --> 37:49.608
Right now! Down!

37:51.825 --> 37:54.293
<i>You're okay. You're okay.</i>

37:58.893 --> 38:00.330
Amelia.

38:00.365 --> 38:03.941
A little victory tradition
I do with Sellitto.

38:03.966 --> 38:06.351
A drink after we close a case.

38:06.826 --> 38:09.270
Figured it's time to bring you
into the fold.

38:09.848 --> 38:13.084
Is this an honor or am I
about to get another lecture?

38:13.285 --> 38:15.186
No lecture. You get the job done.

38:15.639 --> 38:18.041
I can't argue with success.

38:19.317 --> 38:21.652
Huh. So does that mean
you're not still...

38:21.686 --> 38:23.921
Take the win, Amelia.

38:23.955 --> 38:26.657
Now, Lincoln and I,
we like the single malt,

38:26.691 --> 38:29.332
but we didn't want to assume your poison.

38:30.662 --> 38:34.131
Well, after today, how about one of each?

38:34.165 --> 38:36.767
Ah, now you're talking
Sellitto's language.

38:38.670 --> 38:40.737
There you go.

38:42.674 --> 38:44.848
Will you do the honors?

38:49.047 --> 38:52.015
- To success.
- Success.

38:52.050 --> 38:54.023
<i>- Salud.
- Salud.</i>

39:01.459 --> 39:04.951
So... tomorrow.

39:05.730 --> 39:09.833
- Back to the Bone Collector?
- Why wait till tomorrow?

39:09.868 --> 39:11.768
You know what Einstein
was doing when he came up

39:11.803 --> 39:15.572
- with the theory of relativity?
- Looking out the window.

39:15.607 --> 39:17.941
You know, you told me that
story a thousand times.

39:17.976 --> 39:20.210
Loves to compare himself to Einstein.

39:20.245 --> 39:21.824
I have better hair.

39:23.014 --> 39:24.615
While we caught a bomber today,

39:24.649 --> 39:26.316
a thought rose to the surface for me.

39:26.351 --> 39:28.452
We didn't find the
Bone Collector's first kill,

39:28.486 --> 39:30.621
but we may have something equally useful.

39:30.655 --> 39:32.055
Which is what?

39:32.090 --> 39:33.757
I think we found his hometown.

39:33.791 --> 39:36.292
- And given his age...
- Age of the victim.

39:36.327 --> 39:37.926
He was quick to unearth that crime,

39:37.960 --> 39:41.162
which suggests you're right.
He made mistakes.

39:41.197 --> 39:42.630
And that means there's more mistakes,

39:42.665 --> 39:44.766
likely mistakes
he hasn't even considered,

39:44.800 --> 39:46.668
waiting for us if we dig deep enough.

39:46.702 --> 39:48.453
I'm betting he knows it.

39:49.372 --> 39:51.773
He knows we're getting close.

39:51.807 --> 39:55.210
- We got him on the run.
- Scour the area,

39:55.244 --> 39:58.880
talk to the people, look into the past.

39:59.682 --> 40:01.483
The answer is there.

40:01.517 --> 40:04.052
<i>It's only a matter of time.</i>

40:15.231 --> 40:18.199
Shh, shh, shh. It's not what you think.

40:20.503 --> 40:22.037
You're right.

40:22.071 --> 40:23.872
I have been...

40:23.906 --> 40:26.674
What's the word... agitated.

40:26.709 --> 40:30.278
You've been the one
who's held me together.

40:32.581 --> 40:34.207
Still...

40:34.750 --> 40:39.988
I can't help feeling this
might be the most foolish thing

40:40.022 --> 40:41.589
I've ever done.

40:44.360 --> 40:45.693
Freeing you.

40:59.981 --> 41:01.133
Peter.

41:19.962 --> 41:22.630
<i>Requiem, requiem...</i>

41:24.467 --> 41:26.935
Rest now.
