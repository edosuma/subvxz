<i>He lost to Harold Johnson
and to Nino Valdez.</i>

00:48.549 --> 00:53.470
<i>That win to Valdez catapulted him
into the national statistics spotlight also.</i>

00:54.805 --> 00:57.850
<i>Charles, 32 years old, Satterfield, 30.</i>

00:57.933 --> 01:00.018
<i>Here's round two.</i>

01:01.061 --> 01:04.772
<i>189 for Charles, 180 for Satterfield.</i>

01:04.857 --> 01:08.151
<i>Charles is in the white trunks.</i>

01:08.235 --> 01:14.074
<i>A writer, like a boxer, must stand alone.</i>

01:14.157 --> 01:17.703
<i>Satterfield has
surprised all tonight with his right.</i>

01:17.786 --> 01:20.956
<i>Having your words published,
like entering a ring...</i>

01:21.039 --> 01:24.543
<i>puts your talent on display.</i>

01:24.626 --> 01:27.504
<i>And there's nowhere to hide.</i>

01:27.588 --> 01:29.965
<i>The truth is revealed.</i>

01:31.133 --> 01:34.761
<i>And sometimes,
the results can be disastrous.</i>

01:36.638 --> 01:39.266
<i>And Satterfield is down!</i>

01:40.601 --> 01:43.770
<i>Three, four, five, six, seven-</i>

01:43.812 --> 01:48.400
<i>He's not gonna get up. Eight, nine-
And it's all over. Wow!</i>

01:48.483 --> 01:50.402
<i>Ezzard Charles-</i>

02:05.459 --> 02:07.211
<i>Oh!</i>

02:07.294 --> 02:11.381
<i>One, two, three-</i>

02:11.465 --> 02:14.092
<i>- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm okay.</i>

02:14.176 --> 02:15.177
Box!

02:35.489 --> 02:40.160
<i>One, two, three, four...</i>

02:40.202 --> 02:42.496
- five, six-
- Over!

02:42.538 --> 02:45.916
<i>- Whoo!
- seven, eight, nine, 10.</i>

02:45.999 --> 02:48.794
<i>It's over!</i>

02:53.549 --> 02:56.051
<i>Yo, Erik,
was that a left or a right there?</i>

02:57.052 --> 02:59.012
Erik?

03:07.896 --> 03:09.940
There he is, just like I told you.

03:10.023 --> 03:11.942
Come on, guys. Give it a rest.

03:12.025 --> 03:14.987
- Come on. We're just messin' around.
- Leave the poor guy alone.

03:15.988 --> 03:16.989
Hey, Champ!

03:20.158 --> 03:23.078
<i>What's up? How you doin', Champ?</i>

03:23.161 --> 03:27.332
Oh, you know, about 60%.
Tryin' to get a bite.

03:27.416 --> 03:29.751
I told my friends you were the Champ.

03:31.378 --> 03:34.423
- Yeah, that's right.
- I told 'em I kicked the shit out of you.

03:34.506 --> 03:37.926
Kicked the shit right out of me.
Sure did.

03:38.010 --> 03:39.845
<i>- He ain't no champ, Kenny.
- Yeah, I am!</i>

03:39.928 --> 03:43.307
Battlin' Bob Satterfield.
Number three in the world.

03:43.390 --> 03:46.727
- Show 'em your moves.
- Oh, no, I'm shoppin'.

03:46.768 --> 03:48.979
You can shop later.

03:50.647 --> 03:52.608
<i>Come on, Champ!</i>

03:52.691 --> 03:55.027
<i>- Come on.
- Hey, let's go, Champ!</i>

03:55.110 --> 03:57.946
<i>Come on. Show us your punch.</i>

04:01.283 --> 04:03.202
Let's have some fun!

04:03.285 --> 04:06.538
- Wanna see some moves, huh?
- Yeah, show us what you got.

04:07.789 --> 04:09.291
Show us your punch.

04:09.374 --> 04:10.709
- Wanna see my punch?
- Yeah.

04:10.792 --> 04:13.086
Aah!

04:13.128 --> 04:16.048
What is your problem, old man? Shut up.

04:16.130 --> 04:18.216
<i>Dude, is that how you broke
that guy's nose?</i>

04:18.300 --> 04:20.761
Yeah, yeah. Boom!
Made the Rock bleed. Yeah, that's right.

04:22.971 --> 04:25.057
<i>Come on, get up, Champ.</i>

04:25.140 --> 04:27.559
<i>- Come on, Champ!
- I don't want to fight anymore, okay?</i>

04:27.643 --> 04:29.561
<i>- Get up, Champ!
- No. I'm done fightin'.</i>

04:29.645 --> 04:31.563
Come on, Champ. One more round.

04:39.821 --> 04:41.240
Oh!

04:41.323 --> 04:43.784
<i>Come on. Get up, Champ.</i>

04:43.825 --> 04:45.369
- Put your hands up.
- No.

04:45.452 --> 04:47.287
- Put 'em up!
- Fight back, Champ!

04:47.329 --> 04:50.165
<i>Do it, man!</i>

04:52.459 --> 04:54.378
<i>Kenny, the old man's beatin' you!</i>

04:54.461 --> 04:57.172
- Grab him!
- No, no, wait! No, no!

04:57.256 --> 05:00.175
<i>I'm sorry!
I- I didn't mean it, okay?</i>

05:00.259 --> 05:02.386
Right to the midsection!

05:02.469 --> 05:04.888
Are you asleep?

05:04.972 --> 05:08.183
I'm sorry.
I, um-What time is it?

05:08.267 --> 05:11.478
<i>All right. I'll see you tomorrow.</i>

05:11.562 --> 05:14.565
Go back to sleep. All right, sweetie. Bye.

05:14.648 --> 05:17.609
<i>Hey.</i>

05:17.693 --> 05:19.611
<i>Hey, what's goin' on?</i>

05:19.695 --> 05:21.613
Just some assholes having fun.

05:21.697 --> 05:23.240
Do it again!

05:23.323 --> 05:25.367
<i>Hey!</i>

05:25.450 --> 05:28.579
- Yeah! New champ now.
- Hey! What the hell?

05:28.662 --> 05:30.998
I just beat the champion of the world!

05:31.081 --> 05:33.083
<i>And he's down for the count!</i>

05:33.167 --> 05:36.420
<i>- You guys are such assholes.
- Get in the back! Come on!</i>

05:37.713 --> 05:40.799
<i>Yeah! Hell, yeah!</i>

05:40.883 --> 05:44.720
Hey. Hey-

05:46.346 --> 05:50.726
<i>Old man, are you-Are you okay?</i>

05:50.809 --> 05:55.230
Boys just havin' fun.
You know, it's fun to beat the Champ.

05:55.314 --> 05:58.734
Well, you sh-

05:59.902 --> 06:02.696
Yeah, you should, uh-
You should get home.

06:02.738 --> 06:05.741
No, I am home.

06:05.824 --> 06:11.413
You-You say you're the Champ?
What are you talking about?

06:11.496 --> 06:15.584
<i>Yeah, yeah.
Battlin' Bob Satterfield.</i>

06:15.667 --> 06:18.962
<i>Number three in the world.</i>

06:20.756 --> 06:22.758
Hey.

06:24.259 --> 06:27.304
How 'bout, uh-
Can I give you this?

06:27.387 --> 06:30.641
Oh, yeah. Thanks.

06:30.724 --> 06:34.061
You done helped the Champ
when he was down and halfway out.

06:34.144 --> 06:36.688
I won't forget this.

06:36.772 --> 06:39.650
<i>- You sure you're okay?
- Yeah, man.</i>

06:39.733 --> 06:41.860
I'm about 30% right now,
but I'll be okay.

06:46.823 --> 06:48.867
Okay, well, you take care
of yourself, all right?

06:48.951 --> 06:51.453
Yeah. You too.

06:55.916 --> 06:57.835
- John, how are you doing?
- Erik.

07:03.507 --> 07:05.509
<i>Denver Times.</i>

07:11.974 --> 07:15.227
All right, well, there's some weirdness
with the smoking ordinance at the casinos.

07:15.310 --> 07:17.437
Um, just some of the employees there-

07:17.479 --> 07:19.690
I'm sorry. That may be a good
opportunity for an editorial.

07:19.773 --> 07:23.485
<i>The Indian gaming laws
and the responsibilities and so on.</i>

07:23.569 --> 07:26.405
<i>And while we're on the subject, Ralph,
you know, if you don't mind...</i>

07:26.488 --> 07:29.449
<i>I was thinking that maybe we could,
um, assign one of my guys maybe...</i>

07:29.533 --> 07:32.661
to do something about the NFL draft,
the politics involved and-

07:32.744 --> 07:34.705
No, that's good. I like that.
Then, um-

07:34.788 --> 07:37.749
And then my sports guys can do
an editorial on global warming.

07:37.833 --> 07:40.169
<i>- Oh, come on. This is serious.
- No, I mean it.</i>

07:40.252 --> 07:44.256
Guys, guys. You're up, Jo.

07:44.339 --> 07:48.927
Well, the mayor's coming out in favor
of the, um, convention coming here.

07:49.011 --> 07:51.847
<i>So, um-So there's gonna be
a press conference later.</i>

07:51.930 --> 07:55.809
Well, that's that.
Lunch is on me at Duffy's.

07:55.851 --> 07:58.770
<i>Anyone that can bring
me a completed crossword.</i>

07:58.770 --> 08:00.314
<i>Awesome! Love Duffy's.</i>

08:00.397 --> 08:02.608
Are we sending anybody down
to training camp?

08:02.691 --> 08:04.943
I have a budget for a stringer, I guess.

08:05.027 --> 08:07.738
<i>Well, I think it might be nice to
do a draft follow-up.</i>

08:07.738 --> 08:08.238
<i>Yeah, sure.</i>

08:08.322 --> 08:10.240
Good.

08:10.324 --> 08:12.701
Hey, boss.
We got a little buried today, huh?

08:12.784 --> 08:16.622
- What are you talking about?
- The Jermaine fight I covered.

08:16.705 --> 08:20.959
- It was a good fight.
- Oh, yeah. I buried it, right.

08:21.043 --> 08:23.962
- Why?
- Something's got to get buried.

08:24.046 --> 08:26.048
Well, that's what high school wrestling
is for, right?

08:26.131 --> 08:29.009
<i>I mean, it's a solid story.
Not a fact missing.</i>

08:29.051 --> 08:31.011
You had copy 40 minutes after the fight.

08:31.053 --> 08:35.682
Yeah, you're like a machine.
All the style of one too.

08:35.724 --> 08:37.558
- Wait a minute, Ralph.
- Do you mind sitting?

08:44.149 --> 08:46.443
Now, listen. I appreciate
what you're doing, filling my pages.

08:46.527 --> 08:48.487
And I don't want you to stop.

08:48.570 --> 08:51.573
Hey, Ralph? Sorry for interrupting.
Do you want me to e-mail you those quotes?

08:51.657 --> 08:56.161
<i>Yeah, yeah, right.
But your copy, it's unimpressive.</i>

08:57.204 --> 08:59.122
A lot of typing, not much writing.

08:59.206 --> 09:04.086
- Well, Sam Kirby liked-
- He doesn't work here anymore.

09:05.587 --> 09:11.301
<i>The truth is... I forget your pieces
while I'm reading them.</i>

09:11.385 --> 09:14.054
Now, if this is the best you can do,
I'm not gonna complain.

09:15.097 --> 09:17.015
But I know you can do a lot better.

09:18.475 --> 09:20.477
- Why is that, Ralph?
- Because of your name.

09:22.104 --> 09:24.064
<i>- Thanks for the talk.
- Oh, look, come on.</i>

09:24.106 --> 09:28.151
Look. Don't get like a chick on me,
all right? Be a man.

09:29.444 --> 09:32.447
<i>Recognize your weaknesses and fix 'em.</i>

09:32.531 --> 09:36.410
Slow down a bit, you know?
Think quality.

09:37.411 --> 09:40.080
I got it. Got an appointment.

09:41.790 --> 09:43.750
<i>We write it like this.</i>

09:43.792 --> 09:46.420
<i>What the lawsuit is calling for
is an order to force the E.P. A...</i>

09:46.461 --> 09:48.547
to reassign its approval
over the water standards...

09:48.630 --> 09:51.008
for the rivers
affected by the development.

09:51.091 --> 09:54.887
Mm-hmm. Wyoming and Montana
are going to join as interveners.

09:54.928 --> 09:56.889
Okay.

09:58.307 --> 10:00.767
- Hey, was that you calling last night?
- Yeah, yeah, it was.

10:00.809 --> 10:03.103
Sorry about that.

10:03.145 --> 10:06.106
Hey, did you read the article-
Jermaine fight?

10:06.148 --> 10:08.108
Yeah. It was good.

10:08.150 --> 10:10.110
- It was, wasn't it?
- Very solid.

10:10.152 --> 10:12.946
Yeah, solid. Exactly.
Metz hated it. Of course.

10:12.988 --> 10:14.489
What didn't he like?

10:16.033 --> 10:18.535
What does Metz-

10:18.619 --> 10:22.289
What does Metz ever like?
I don't know. He wasn't specific.

10:22.331 --> 10:25.501
You know,
he's never going to let me write...

10:25.584 --> 10:27.586
on the Broncos or the Nuggets.

10:27.669 --> 10:30.297
Well, maybe Metz will come around.

10:30.339 --> 10:36.011
It doesn't really matter because,
um, I'm having lunch with Whitley.

10:36.094 --> 10:37.596
<i>Today.</i>

10:37.679 --> 10:40.057
I might have a shot at the magazine.

10:40.140 --> 10:42.809
<i>- That's great.
- Yeah, it is.</i>

10:42.851 --> 10:43.519
That is great.

10:43.519 --> 10:45.646
Nothing certain yet,
but it seems pretty positive.

10:45.687 --> 10:47.648
<i>- That's fantastic.
- Yep.</i>

10:47.689 --> 10:49.399
Does Metz know?

10:49.483 --> 10:53.237
Are you serious?
What are you on?

10:53.320 --> 10:55.239
No, Metz doesn't know.

10:59.535 --> 11:02.996
Hey, I was wondering if I could shoot
some hoops with Teddy this afternoon.

11:03.080 --> 11:04.998
You know,
Teddy's only gonna get used to this...

11:05.082 --> 11:07.084
if we stick on the schedule
that we agreed on.

11:07.167 --> 11:09.461
We're separated, okay?

11:09.545 --> 11:13.799
It's easy for you to say. You haven't
had your son cleaved from you.

11:15.884 --> 11:18.804
All right, all right.
A little over-dramatic. Sorry.

11:18.887 --> 11:20.931
Sorry, I'm just-

11:21.014 --> 11:24.268
Ball's in the play box in the garage.

11:24.351 --> 11:27.521
Thank you. Thank you.

11:27.563 --> 11:30.691
- Talk to Metz.
- Sure.

11:31.525 --> 11:34.987
<i>So, um, listen, I was, uh- I was sorry
to hear about your old man.</i>

11:35.028 --> 11:37.823
Mmm. Thank you.

11:37.906 --> 11:40.534
It was cancer, right?

11:40.617 --> 11:43.745
Yeah. Uh, here.

11:43.829 --> 11:45.414
Hmm. Of all places.

11:45.497 --> 11:49.751
- Ironic, right?
- Yeah. We got the iced teas coming?

11:49.835 --> 11:51.753
- Mm-hmm, sure.
- Thank you.

11:51.837 --> 11:54.840
Look, we've read your stuff,
Fred Roselle and I.

11:54.923 --> 11:57.050
And I'm sorry to say,
it's just not there.

11:57.092 --> 11:59.928
<i>Not yet anyway.</i>

12:00.012 --> 12:02.681
The consensus
was that it lacked personality.

12:03.932 --> 12:05.976
Exactly.

12:06.059 --> 12:11.607
I mean, Bing, last year, under Kirby,
I had 192 bylines.

12:11.690 --> 12:15.194
That's the most of any reporter
in the history of the newspaper.

12:15.277 --> 12:17.613
You say my stuff is thin?
Of course it is.

12:17.696 --> 12:19.907
A lot of typing, no writing.
I don't have time.

12:19.948 --> 12:24.286
<i>And this year, I have a new editor.
So I keep an open mind.</i>

12:24.369 --> 12:27.748
And guess what? He's working me
even harder than Kirby was.

12:27.789 --> 12:31.460
<i>I mean, he thinks I'm a machine.</i>

12:31.543 --> 12:37.466
Anytime I bring in a story with just
an ounce of heart, Metz spikes it.

12:37.549 --> 12:41.720
I mean, this is stuff that I think that
the magazine should have- magazine deserves.

12:41.803 --> 12:44.640
- Okay, give me an example.
- Well-

12:44.723 --> 12:47.392
- Is that the mango?
- Yeah.

12:47.476 --> 12:49.811
<i>- It's not the peach?
- No, it's the mango.</i>

12:49.895 --> 12:52.231
<i>Sorry. I'm sorry.
Give me an example.</i>

12:52.272 --> 12:55.108
I mean, there's- I have so many.
But sometimes I feel blocked.

12:55.192 --> 12:56.318
I'm not very good at this.

12:56.318 --> 12:58.445
No, no, no. Just anything.
Just give me an example.

12:58.487 --> 13:03.283
Um, crossroads. Uh, Elway.

13:03.325 --> 13:06.119
You know, what does he do now
at this point in his life?

13:06.161 --> 13:07.204
Maybe he runs for governor.

13:07.204 --> 13:09.039
I get that one proposed
and rejected twice a week.

13:09.122 --> 13:11.041
People don't want to hear
about their heroes aging.

13:11.124 --> 13:13.418
Okay, okay.
Well, then what about Coors Field?

13:13.502 --> 13:16.588
- The worst place to pitch-
- The worst place to pitch in America.

13:16.672 --> 13:20.968
Uh, strikin' out.

13:21.051 --> 13:24.137
Um-

13:24.221 --> 13:29.518
Well, there's this boxer.
An ex-heavyweight contender.

13:29.601 --> 13:31.895
He's, uh, living on the streets of Denver.

13:31.979 --> 13:35.023
- He's living in the trash.
- Yeah?

13:35.107 --> 13:38.235
Yeah. And, you know, he kind of patrols
the neighborhood. He calls himself the Champ.

13:38.318 --> 13:41.780
<i>He's a- He's a lovely guy.</i>

13:41.864 --> 13:47.452
And the story, it's beautiful.
It's touching.

13:47.494 --> 13:49.913
But I tell Metz about it,
and he says, " Forget about it.

13:49.997 --> 13:52.457
It's a dry hole.
Go cover the Jermaine fight."

13:52.541 --> 13:55.544
What's his name, the, uh- the boxer?

13:55.627 --> 13:57.629
Satterfield.

14:00.048 --> 14:02.176
Bob Satterfield?

14:02.259 --> 14:05.888
<i>- Yeah. Bob.
- Wow.</i>

14:05.971 --> 14:10.142
Are you sure? My dad used to idolize that guy.
I thought he was dead.

14:10.184 --> 14:13.020
- He- No, he's dead.
- That's what everybody thinks.

14:13.103 --> 14:16.648
And that's why I think that this story
is such a great story.

14:16.732 --> 14:19.735
I want to call it
"Resurrecting the Champ."

14:19.818 --> 14:23.071
- And he's here in Denver?
- Yeah.

14:23.155 --> 14:25.908
- Bob Satterfield?
- I saw him yesterday.

14:27.576 --> 14:30.078
What are your plans for this?

14:30.162 --> 14:32.206
Well, I thought maybe
I'd take my time.

14:32.289 --> 14:36.668
You know, really work well on it,
work hard. Think quality.

14:36.752 --> 14:39.463
And see if I can get Metz
to come around.

14:39.546 --> 14:41.965
Well, if, uh-

14:43.842 --> 14:46.845
If you can't bring him around,
I'd be glad to take a look at it.

14:46.929 --> 14:52.184
Well, that'd be great.
That'd be terrific.

14:52.226 --> 14:54.478
<i>When he won in California,
it was already too late.</i>

14:54.561 --> 14:56.522
<i>Mondale had already
had enough delegates.</i>

14:56.563 --> 14:58.732
<i>Um, no, I think so.</i>

14:58.815 --> 15:02.152
Uh, November 30-
I don't have an exact date. I can find one.

15:02.236 --> 15:04.154
- Hey.
- One second. Okay.

15:04.238 --> 15:07.282
No, I'll get it for you and I'll-
Okay. Bye.

15:07.366 --> 15:09.284
- Hey.
- Hey. How's it goin'?

15:09.368 --> 15:12.246
- Great.
- Can you keep a secret, Molly?

15:12.287 --> 15:13.914
- Can you?
- Sure.

15:13.914 --> 15:15.374
- Can you?
- Sure.

15:15.457 --> 15:17.876
My name's not Molly.

15:19.294 --> 15:22.172
Yes, that's true.
'Cause it's Millie, right?

15:22.256 --> 15:23.757
- Polly.
- Polly.

15:23.799 --> 15:26.635
Close. Yeah.
What can I do for you?

15:26.718 --> 15:32.099
Uh, well, I'm doing
a story on a heavyweight fighter...

15:32.140 --> 15:34.351
from the 1950s named Bob Satterfield.

15:34.434 --> 15:36.854
But, um, nobody can know about it.

15:36.937 --> 15:39.690
You're moonlighting.
It's none of Metz's business.

15:39.773 --> 15:43.068
- You got it.
- Yeah.

15:43.151 --> 15:46.029
What do you need?

15:46.113 --> 15:49.116
Well, um, there wasn't much on him
on the Internet.

15:49.199 --> 15:52.786
So I guess you're gonna have to
go old school on this one.

15:52.828 --> 15:55.706
I kind of need everything
you can find on him.

15:55.789 --> 16:00.043
<i>From our library, New York Times,
L. A. Times, Ring magazine, of course.</i>

16:00.127 --> 16:03.046
If you can find out if there's
a Boxing Hall of Fame, that'd be great.

16:03.130 --> 16:08.218
Anybody he may have fought.
Uh, trainers, anything.

16:08.302 --> 16:10.220
Shouldn't you write this down
or something?

16:10.304 --> 16:12.306
<i>Plausible deniability.</i>

16:12.389 --> 16:14.725
I've got to take that.

16:14.808 --> 16:17.311
I will get the information
and bring it to your cubicle.

16:17.311 --> 16:17.561
Okay.

16:17.644 --> 16:20.272
Let's go. Drive it in.
Take it into the hoop.

16:20.355 --> 16:23.775
I'm a big ol' slow guy. You can't take it
inside on me. You can't do it!

16:23.859 --> 16:26.195
- Foul!
- Foul?

16:26.236 --> 16:28.780
Okay. Take some free throws then.

16:28.864 --> 16:32.701
Aim for my hand, all right?
Front of the rim, my hand.

16:32.784 --> 16:34.620
<i>Get it up there.</i>

16:34.703 --> 16:37.789
You gotta roll it off
the ends of your fingers, okay?

16:37.873 --> 16:41.084
- I suck.
- You don't suck.

16:41.168 --> 16:43.337
You think Shaq was hittin' baskets
when he was your age?

16:43.420 --> 16:45.589
- Yeah.
- Well, he wasn't.

16:45.672 --> 16:47.966
He told me so himself.

16:48.050 --> 16:51.053
He said that he was a big ol' spaz
when he was your age.

16:51.136 --> 16:54.139
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

16:54.223 --> 16:57.768
But he told me that in confidence, buddy.
So you can't tell anybody, okay?

16:57.851 --> 17:00.020
<i>- Dad?
- Yes?</i>

17:00.103 --> 17:03.106
Have you called up John Elway yet
and asked if he's playing next year?

17:04.566 --> 17:06.527
You know, we keep missing
each other, buddy.

17:06.568 --> 17:10.196
<i>I hope he comes back.
The Broncos need him.</i>

17:10.280 --> 17:15.743
You know, I told him that you said that.
And he said he'd consider it.

17:15.828 --> 17:17.871
- Really?
- Really.

17:17.913 --> 17:20.165
So if he comes back,
you're partially responsible.

17:20.249 --> 17:24.837
Are you gonna stay for dinner tonight?
Mom's making spaghetti and meatballs.

17:24.920 --> 17:27.881
<i>Would you like me to?</i>

17:27.964 --> 17:30.551
Hi, sweetie. Hey, Erik.

17:30.592 --> 17:33.804
So, Teddy was just inviting me to stay
for spaghetti and meatballs.

17:35.264 --> 17:37.224
What do you think?

17:37.266 --> 17:39.768
- How'd it go with Whitley today?
- We'll talk about it later.

17:39.852 --> 17:42.896
Are you gonna make more money
at the magazine?

17:42.938 --> 17:46.358
Mmm, no. But that's not
really the point, buddy.

17:46.441 --> 17:48.360
It's about the prestige.

17:48.443 --> 17:53.490
<i>And I'd probably have to write
maybe 15 articles a year. Maybe.</i>

17:53.574 --> 17:56.743
- That's a lot of stories.
- Actually, it's not.

17:56.827 --> 17:58.912
It's only about one
every three and a half weeks.

17:58.996 --> 18:01.957
<i>That means I can really concentrate on them,
make them good.</i>

18:01.999 --> 18:05.961
Then maybe I can become
as respected as your mom.

18:06.003 --> 18:10.007
<i>It could be like a ticket
to the big time kind of thing.</i>

18:10.090 --> 18:11.884
<i>Los Angeles Times, New York Times.</i>

18:11.967 --> 18:14.344
Like the story on the boxer
that you pitched to Whitley?

18:14.428 --> 18:17.014
Exactly.

18:17.097 --> 18:21.268
<i>In fact, I better get back to the alley,
see if he's still sleeping there.</i>

18:21.351 --> 18:24.188
There's a man sleeping in the alley?

18:24.271 --> 18:27.316
Yeah, buddy. Some people do that.
They don't have a home.

18:27.399 --> 18:32.154
Or friends or family.
They gotta sleep in the alley.

18:32.196 --> 18:34.489
This sounds like
it's gonna be a very sad story.

18:35.991 --> 18:39.244
No, buddy. It's gonna be a hopeful story.
Don't worry.

18:40.662 --> 18:43.499
Who's coming to Career Day, you or Mom?

18:43.582 --> 18:46.293
Well, I'm sure your friends
would rather hear about...

18:46.376 --> 18:48.921
your dad's work as a sportswriter...

18:49.004 --> 18:50.839
than my conversations...

18:50.923 --> 18:55.219
with Herb... Milton.

18:55.302 --> 18:57.471
He's the city mass transit accountant.

18:57.513 --> 19:00.015
That was awesome.
I'm gonna go find Satterfield.

19:00.098 --> 19:03.560
Your mom and I will talk about who's
coming to Career Day. Okay, buddy?

19:03.644 --> 19:06.939
I love you. See you, buddy.

19:07.022 --> 19:09.274
<i>- Bye, Daddy.
- Bye.</i>

19:28.043 --> 19:31.630
<i>Good evening, all you boys and some girls.</i>

19:31.713 --> 19:34.049
<i>This is Erik "The Wow Man" Kernan.</i>

19:34.132 --> 19:36.844
<i>And, wow, was there a fight tonight!</i>

19:36.927 --> 19:40.973
<i>In the hot, stale air of Las Vegas,
it was a three-round affair...</i>

19:41.056 --> 19:44.726
<i>that carried the weight of war and sin
on its head and shoulders.</i>

19:44.810 --> 19:47.145
<i>There was a winner. That's for sure.</i>

20:01.201 --> 20:04.913
Jesus Christ!

20:06.582 --> 20:11.420
You're Champ, right?
Your last name is Satterfield?

20:11.461 --> 20:14.423
Yeah. Battlin' Bob Satterfield,
number three in the world.

20:14.464 --> 20:16.508
Right. Okay.

20:16.592 --> 20:19.803
- You told me that last night.
- Last night.

20:19.887 --> 20:24.099
<i>Yeah, you- Those, um, kids
came in here, and they were-</i>

20:24.183 --> 20:26.226
Oh, yeah, yeah! Yeah.

20:26.268 --> 20:28.812
You done helped Champ
when he was down and halfway out.

20:28.896 --> 20:32.774
<i>Yeah. I'm Erik Kernan
of The Denver Times.</i>

20:32.858 --> 20:35.277
I was wondering
if I could buy you a cup of coffee.

20:35.319 --> 20:38.780
I don't drink coffee.
I used to. But not no more.

20:38.864 --> 20:42.201
Uh, how about a cold beer?

20:42.284 --> 20:46.955
Yeah, I indulge in a beer
every now and then.

20:48.790 --> 20:50.918
I think people would love your story.

20:51.001 --> 20:54.838
I mean, you were-
You were almost champion of the world.

20:54.922 --> 20:56.924
Ah, that was a long time ago.

20:57.007 --> 21:00.844
You fought LaMotta.
You fought Patterson.

21:00.928 --> 21:05.307
You heard a whole stadium of people
stand up and call out your name.

21:08.143 --> 21:11.021
- You remember that?
- Sure. Sure, I remember.

21:12.648 --> 21:14.566
People would know you.

21:14.650 --> 21:17.778
You could walk down the street,
everybody would know your name.

21:17.861 --> 21:20.572
So, what you gonna write about?

21:20.656 --> 21:23.617
<i>I'm gonna write
what you tell me, your story.</i>

21:28.330 --> 21:33.168
Nah. Everybody already
know my name. I'm Champ.

21:35.921 --> 21:40.133
<i>Well, just in case.</i>

21:44.638 --> 21:48.976
Kernan. Kernan, like that guy who used to
be on the radio a long time ago.

21:49.017 --> 21:51.103
<i>- Yeah, he was my father.
- You don't say.</i>

21:51.186 --> 21:53.105
I do, yeah.

21:53.188 --> 21:58.569
Your father
ruined Christmas for me one year.

21:58.652 --> 22:03.866
<i>He was on the radio talkin' all about
how I was a disappointment.</i>

22:06.201 --> 22:08.287
Christmas Eve, 1953.

22:09.371 --> 22:14.543
<i>I went from up and coming
to a has-been.</i>

22:14.626 --> 22:16.587
Nothin' in between.

22:18.463 --> 22:22.050
Pissed me off, your daddy did.

22:23.886 --> 22:26.013
Well, let me make it up to you.

22:26.096 --> 22:29.183
I'll come back around,
next day or two.

22:29.266 --> 22:31.226
Maybe we can have another beer.

22:32.519 --> 22:35.147
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. All right. Yeah.

22:35.230 --> 22:39.151
Hey! You know,
I ain't gonna forget this.

22:39.234 --> 22:42.571
You done helped the Champ
when he was down and damn near out.

22:42.613 --> 22:45.157
I'm trying to find something
we can all listen to.

22:45.240 --> 22:47.159
Well, I can put together a list, I guess.

22:47.242 --> 22:50.704
There are a couple bands that are new,
that are good. But they're not too loud.

22:50.787 --> 22:54.500
<i>- Yeah. Not all that acid stuff.
- No, I wouldn't do that to you, I promise.</i>

22:54.583 --> 22:57.419
<i>- Yeah, what?
- Boss. Hey. Miller's out with the flu.</i>

22:57.461 --> 22:59.963
Yeah, I know, it's going around.
You oughta get a flu shot.

23:00.047 --> 23:01.965
<i>- I did.
- They're giving 'em out on the second floor.</i>

23:02.049 --> 23:04.426
Yeah, I did. I just was wondering
if I could cover for him.

23:04.468 --> 23:07.012
Trailblazers are in town,
and he was supposed to cover the game.

23:07.095 --> 23:08.472
I'll just put together a list.

23:08.472 --> 23:10.974
I need those quotes. I need
more quotes on the golf story.

23:11.058 --> 23:14.603
- Hey, Erik.
- Uh, I was wondering if I could cover for him.

23:14.686 --> 23:16.772
No, no.
Duncan's got the Trailblazers game.

23:16.855 --> 23:18.774
I thought Duncan was covering
the bantamweight fight.

23:18.857 --> 23:22.444
<i>You're gonna take the fight, and he's got
the Trailblazers. I promised him. I'm sorry.</i>

23:22.528 --> 23:24.613
Okay. Yeah. It's just that my kid...

23:24.696 --> 23:27.783
I was gonna take him
because he idolizes the Trailblazers.

23:27.866 --> 23:29.785
They're his heroes.

23:31.286 --> 23:35.874
I'm sorry. The Trailblazers,
they're his- they're his heroes?

23:35.958 --> 23:40.629
<i>- Yeah.
- Now I know you're full of shit.</i>

23:40.712 --> 23:41.588
See you, Ralph.

23:41.588 --> 23:44.299
You give it away like
that. No, really. I know now.

23:44.466 --> 23:46.593
Boom! That's just the way
it happened too.

23:46.677 --> 23:49.596
I broke not the big bone in
his nose, but the small one.

23:49.596 --> 23:49.888
Damn.

23:49.972 --> 23:51.598
You kicked some ass back in the day.

23:51.682 --> 23:53.600
That's right. Bob Satterfield,
number three in the world.

23:54.101 --> 23:55.727
Yo, man, I gotta go though.

23:55.811 --> 23:58.230
All right, youngblood.
Take it easy, baby. All right.

23:59.314 --> 24:02.025
- Hey, Champ.
- Hey, hey!

24:02.109 --> 24:04.570
You-You scared him off.
He thought you was the police.

24:04.653 --> 24:08.198
- Well, I'm definitely not. You remember who I am?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

24:08.282 --> 24:11.493
You're the guy helped the Champ when he
was down and halfway out. You that reporter.

24:11.577 --> 24:16.081
- I'm honored. How you feelin'?
- Oh, you know, about 60%.

24:16.165 --> 24:18.667
Have you thought at all
about talkin' with me?

24:18.750 --> 24:22.671
No, I ain't been thinkin' about nothin'.
I'm savin' that till later.

24:22.754 --> 24:24.715
What are you doin' now?
Are you busy?

24:31.471 --> 24:33.932
<i>Corners.</i>

24:39.104 --> 24:41.231
<i>So I'm sorry
I brought you to a dog, Champ.</i>

24:41.315 --> 24:43.859
No, no, no. The white kid?

24:43.942 --> 24:46.570
<i>He's gonna knock
the Spanish kid on his ass.</i>

24:46.653 --> 24:49.114
- Don't you mean the other way around?
- Mm-mmm.

24:49.198 --> 24:51.116
Kernan, who's your buddy?

24:53.160 --> 24:56.371
- Tillman, Bob. Bob, Tillman.
- How ya doin', Bob?

24:56.455 --> 24:58.832
Oh, about 90% tonight.

24:58.874 --> 25:01.627
Um, you got any more of those beers?

25:03.003 --> 25:06.256
Sure. Have mine. Help yourself.

25:06.340 --> 25:08.300
White boy's gonna knock
the spicky kid out.

25:08.383 --> 25:12.012
No way.
Gomez is way too strong, man.

25:25.400 --> 25:30.447
One, two, three, four...

25:30.531 --> 25:34.701
<i>five, six, seven, eight...</i>

25:34.785 --> 25:36.912
<i>nine, 10!</i>

25:36.995 --> 25:40.415
<i>This is over!</i>

25:40.499 --> 25:43.919
How did you see that coming, Champ?
The knockout, I mean.

25:44.002 --> 25:48.549
Oh, oh, well, I, um-
I see the white boy, uh-uh-

25:48.590 --> 25:51.051
- Durant.
- Yeah. I see Durant, he was...

25:51.093 --> 25:53.554
he was, like, takin' that ass-whoopin'.

25:53.595 --> 25:55.806
<i>- But-But then I seen his eyes.
- What about his eyes?</i>

25:55.889 --> 26:00.394
Well, he, um- He figured out
that the Spanish fella, he had a tell.

26:00.477 --> 26:05.941
See? A tell. When he switched over
from lefty back to righty.

26:05.983 --> 26:09.403
See, I saw his eyes figure out
that the spicky boy...

26:09.444 --> 26:12.281
he cocked his head to the left
before he made the switch.

26:12.322 --> 26:14.366
He had that figured-out look
in his eye.

26:14.449 --> 26:16.368
<i>- You saw that?
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.</i>

26:16.451 --> 26:19.037
I done seen it in my opponents' eyes
way too many times.

26:21.165 --> 26:25.419
Ah, don't nobody want to read
about an old man like me.

26:25.502 --> 26:29.798
Sure, they do. Most fight fans
think you're dead, Champ.

26:29.882 --> 26:32.426
I mean, wait till they hear
what you've been through.

26:32.467 --> 26:36.305
And that you're still around to tell about it?
They'll shit themselves.

26:36.388 --> 26:38.599
You'll be a celebrity again.

26:51.862 --> 26:55.949
<i>Champ, I gotta tell ya.</i>

26:57.159 --> 26:59.161
I'm in real trouble where I work.

27:01.163 --> 27:04.374
<i>I'm just about down and out myself.</i>

27:06.001 --> 27:09.338
<i>I'm havin' a real dry spell at the paper.</i>

27:09.421 --> 27:12.132
They're talkin' about firin' me.

27:14.718 --> 27:19.181
Newspapers are being forced to cut bulk
because of the Internet and all that.

27:23.852 --> 27:26.146
Champ...

27:27.439 --> 27:30.901
this article is my title shot.

27:41.620 --> 27:45.791
All right, son. All right.

27:47.209 --> 27:50.087
You ask the questions. I answer.

27:51.755 --> 27:54.716
<i>Thanks.</i>

27:56.802 --> 27:59.304
<i>See, Rocky Marciano...</i>

27:59.388 --> 28:02.891
<i>he's gettin' ready
for that Jersey Joe Walcott fight.</i>

28:02.975 --> 28:06.603
<i>And Rocky, well, he hired
all the good sparring partners around.</i>

28:06.687 --> 28:09.690
<i>And they paid us at that time,
oh, what was it?</i>

28:09.773 --> 28:11.733
<i>Oh, yeah, $50 apiece, I think.</i>

28:11.775 --> 28:14.987
<i>- Come on, Rock!
- It was on a Sunday.</i>

28:15.070 --> 28:17.489
<i>We put on an exhibition
at Grossinger's in New York.</i>

28:17.573 --> 28:19.491
Keep your arms up! Keep your arms up!

28:19.575 --> 28:21.952
You're gonna take Jersey Joe down
in the first round!

28:22.035 --> 28:25.622
<i>Oh, he was strong,
I'm gonna tell ya.</i>

28:25.706 --> 28:28.250
<i>Hit me on the glove,
still knock me down.</i>

28:28.333 --> 28:33.172
<i>But not out. See? I got up.
Started fightin' harder.</i>

28:33.255 --> 28:36.008
<i>And I kept hittin' him on the nose
and hittin' him on the nose...</i>

28:36.091 --> 28:38.385
<i>till his nose started bleeding.</i>

28:40.929 --> 28:43.932
<i>And every time he come to hit
with that overhand right...</i>

28:44.016 --> 28:46.268
<i>I'd get back
and shoot a short right up to him.</i>

28:46.351 --> 28:49.396
<i>- And-And then his nose wouldn't stop.
- You all right?</i>

28:49.479 --> 28:53.734
<i>Everybody was all concerned and stuff,
but, you know, Rocky was tough as hell.</i>

28:53.817 --> 28:56.528
<i>He came back!
But I had him.</i>

28:56.612 --> 28:58.572
<i>He's goin' down, Rock. He's goin' down.</i>

28:58.655 --> 29:01.408
Whoo!

29:01.450 --> 29:03.911
That's just the way it happened too.

29:03.952 --> 29:08.707
Now, now, I broke not the big bone in his nose,
but the little bone. Busted it.

29:08.790 --> 29:12.586
<i>Now, I-I-I'm not one
to give my opinion, all right?</i>

29:12.628 --> 29:17.132
But every time Rocky fought after that,
his nose bled.

29:17.216 --> 29:22.179
<i>Defended the title six times,
but always had trouble with that nose.</i>

29:22.262 --> 29:24.181
I'm thinkin' that's why he quit.

29:31.313 --> 29:34.149
<i>What about your father?
He must have been proud.</i>

29:34.233 --> 29:37.486
<i>No, no. He used to whoop me.</i>

29:37.569 --> 29:39.488
<i>- Seriously?
- Yeah, yeah.</i>

29:39.571 --> 29:42.032
Look-Look here, see?

29:45.077 --> 29:50.541
- When did he do that?
- Oh, I think I was... nine years old.

29:54.044 --> 29:57.339
What? Your daddy never whoop you?

29:57.422 --> 30:02.386
- No.
- Mmm. Well, you're a lucky man.

30:35.669 --> 30:39.631
<i>Merry Christmas
to all you boys and some girls.</i>

30:39.715 --> 30:43.594
<i>This is Erik "The Wow Man'"Kernan
speaking of pugilism...</i>

30:43.635 --> 30:46.138
<i>where tonight, wow...</i>

30:46.180 --> 30:49.391
<i>the art of the sport was reduced
to something less than that...</i>

30:49.474 --> 30:53.770
<i>when one Thomas Kincaid entered the ring
with one Bernard Summerville.</i>

30:53.812 --> 30:59.568
<i>As I sat watching the battle from my humble perch
beneath them, one thing became clear.</i>

30:59.651 --> 31:03.614
<i>Mr. Kincaid is no longer worthy
to carry the title of heir apparent...</i>

31:03.697 --> 31:06.575
<i>in a world once inhabited
by the greats, by the giants...</i>

31:06.658 --> 31:10.162
<i>by the Dempseys,
by the Walcotts, by the Lewises.</i>

31:10.245 --> 31:13.290
<i>This is Erik "The Wow Man'"Kernan.</i>

31:13.373 --> 31:16.043
<i>And we'll be right back
after these words.</i>

31:24.635 --> 31:26.553
Nice article.

31:26.637 --> 31:29.056
- Yep. Thanks.
- You're welcome.

31:33.936 --> 31:36.355
<i>Erik Kernan, Denver Times.</i>

31:36.438 --> 31:38.607
Hey, Ken, what's up?

31:40.025 --> 31:44.363
Uh, I gotta call you back, all right?
Just a second. See ya.

31:44.446 --> 31:47.950
- Hey, Ralph.
- Morning. Nice piece.

31:49.201 --> 31:51.161
Yeah? Thanks.

31:51.203 --> 31:53.288
Normally, I'd cut the whole
reading of the eyes bit.

31:53.372 --> 31:55.666
But I don't know.
It smelled authentic.

31:55.707 --> 31:57.751
I'm glad you liked it.

31:57.835 --> 32:01.213
Aren't you glad you didn't go
to that bullshit basketball game?

32:01.213 --> 32:01.505
Yeah.

32:22.317 --> 32:24.236
- Champ.
- Hey!

32:26.071 --> 32:28.907
- Weren't we supposed to meet?
- Is that right?

32:28.991 --> 32:32.703
Last night. We said we were gonna meet
at the park about an hour ago?

32:35.414 --> 32:38.208
W-Well, here we are.

32:41.336 --> 32:43.338
That's our piece. Page one.

32:43.422 --> 32:46.675
How about that?
There's spicky boy on his ass.

32:46.758 --> 32:48.719
How 'bout that?

32:48.802 --> 32:53.473
Hey, uh-uh-uh-
How 'bout I buy you lunch?

32:53.557 --> 32:55.475
Yeah.

32:57.561 --> 33:00.272
- Always this many people here, Champ?
- Mm-hmm.

33:00.355 --> 33:02.816
- Food always this good?
- Oh, yeah, most times.

33:02.900 --> 33:06.236
They do make a fish soup some days,
but you don't want to touch that.

33:07.779 --> 33:10.782
Aren't you afraid someone's
gonna steal your cart?

33:10.824 --> 33:15.412
No. We got this kind of homeless
code of honor, you know?

33:15.496 --> 33:18.040
It's all right.
Nobody's gonna bother it.

33:18.123 --> 33:20.042
You know what would be good
for the story?

33:20.125 --> 33:24.171
If I could look at some of the stuff in your cart,
see what you lug around every day.

33:24.254 --> 33:26.840
I think it'd be really interesting
for the article.

33:26.924 --> 33:29.676
All right, we can do that...

33:29.760 --> 33:33.347
as soon as you take me to your house
and let me go through all your personal stuff.

33:36.350 --> 33:39.770
Oh, you know, I listened to my father's tape.
Christmas, 1953.

33:39.811 --> 33:42.231
- Mmm.
- And he didn't mention you.

33:42.314 --> 33:45.108
He didn't talk about you
till about a week later.

33:45.150 --> 33:48.570
Well, maybe I got Christmas
and New Year's confused.

33:48.654 --> 33:51.240
Is your daddy still alive?

33:51.323 --> 33:54.743
No, he-Throat cancer.

33:54.827 --> 33:57.955
Throat cancer.
Wow. That's, um-That's, uh-

33:57.996 --> 34:00.624
Ironic.

34:00.707 --> 34:06.547
Irony is when something seems like
it's going a certain way, and then-

34:06.630 --> 34:09.091
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, I know-
I know what irony is, kid.

34:09.174 --> 34:11.927
You know, I-I've had a lot
of experience with irony.

34:13.428 --> 34:15.429
Sorry.

34:16.889 --> 34:18.851
So, you have much formal education?

34:18.891 --> 34:23.063
No, no. Didn't have much schooling.
I was always boxing.

34:25.190 --> 34:27.484
I never dreamed, though,
I'd be heavyweight champ.

34:27.568 --> 34:32.239
But I always thought that if I got that shot,
I would like to think that-

34:32.322 --> 34:34.824
that if I got that shot,
that I would win it.

34:34.867 --> 34:37.578
Get that respect.

34:39.538 --> 34:41.831
<i>But you didn't get the chance.</i>

34:41.915 --> 34:43.917
No. No, no. Never did.

34:46.837 --> 34:49.797
I had this fight with Ezzard Charles.
He was makin' a comeback.

34:49.882 --> 34:54.844
<i>If-If I beat him, then I could go
from number three to number one.</i>

34:54.928 --> 34:57.514
<i>Then I could get that title.
Get a shot at that belt.</i>

35:02.603 --> 35:06.690
<i>But he caught me and somehow
knocked me flat on my back.</i>

35:07.816 --> 35:09.526
<i>Out cold.</i>

35:09.568 --> 35:13.155
<i>That was a- How you say?
It was a-</i>

35:13.238 --> 35:17.326
That was a big humiliation for me.

35:17.409 --> 35:21.205
I had a couple more fights after that.
But I was only about 30%.

35:21.246 --> 35:23.665
Wasn't no need in me carryin' on.

35:23.749 --> 35:27.920
<i>I moved to Sioux City, see?
Up and left my family.</i>

35:29.296 --> 35:31.381
<i>On account of the humiliation?</i>

35:31.423 --> 35:34.051
<i>Yeah, yeah, exactly right.</i>

35:34.134 --> 35:36.470
<i>I worked in the horse stables, uh-</i>

35:36.553 --> 35:41.058
<i>One of the owners, he-he-he found out
who I was, and he had this idea, see?</i>

35:41.141 --> 35:43.602
<i>I told you before.
You can't be standing still.</i>

35:43.644 --> 35:47.105
You can't fight his fight!
You have to fight your own fight!

35:47.147 --> 35:50.108
<i>He boxed me in the West
and the-and-and-and the Midwest...</i>

35:50.150 --> 35:52.110
<i>where nobody knew nothin'
about boxing.</i>

35:52.152 --> 35:54.196
<i>Wasn't no real competition.</i>

35:54.279 --> 35:57.574
<i>These were, how you say,
uh-uh-uh, non-sanctioned.</i>

35:57.616 --> 35:59.785
<i>But, hell, I could be a winner.</i>

36:18.929 --> 36:22.391
<i>So, I fought and fought.
Must've been, like, every other week.</i>

36:33.110 --> 36:35.279
<i>Knocked all of 'em out.</i>

36:39.825 --> 36:45.289
<i>And in this corner,
weighing a lean, mean 185 pounds...</i>

36:45.330 --> 36:51.295
from Chicago, Illinois,
Battlin' Bob Satterfield!

36:51.378 --> 36:54.173
<i>But maybe I-I-I- How-How you say-</i>

36:54.256 --> 36:56.300
<i>Boxed-Boxed too much.</i>

36:56.341 --> 36:58.802
<i>One day I was just plain exhausted
and beat to shit.</i>

37:07.519 --> 37:11.356
<i>Some huge boy
knocked me down hard.</i>

37:14.193 --> 37:16.570
<i>Knocked me in the eye.</i>

37:16.653 --> 37:19.490
<i>And messed up my vision real bad.</i>

37:22.284 --> 37:25.329
<i>Then I-I-I-I-I just- I just couldn't
fight no more after that.</i>

37:27.539 --> 37:31.251
And that-That son of a bitch owner,
he kept all the money.

37:31.335 --> 37:35.005
He said, uh, I had messed up
the merchandise.

37:39.218 --> 37:41.512
So, then I hitched my way down here.

37:46.892 --> 37:48.852
I remember fighting out here once.

37:51.647 --> 37:54.691
Air was clean.

37:54.775 --> 37:58.570
Been out here
for, ooh, 40-somethin' years.

37:59.571 --> 38:02.199
Jesus Christ.

38:02.241 --> 38:04.201
This is all I could find on your guy.

38:06.245 --> 38:08.205
I'll keep looking,
but there's not a lot out there.

38:08.247 --> 38:11.124
- Thank you.
- Sorry.

38:11.208 --> 38:13.502
Did you find the contact information
on Satterfield Jr?

38:13.585 --> 38:15.629
There are no listings in Ohio,
where he's from.

38:15.712 --> 38:19.383
But I'll try New York, and then Pennsylvania.
And we'll go from there.

38:19.466 --> 38:22.845
<i>- Thanks.
- I did also find this.</i>

38:24.847 --> 38:26.515
What's that?

38:26.598 --> 38:29.643
<i>Did you get that press release
from the mayor's office?</i>

38:35.023 --> 38:38.443
<i>I'll call you back. Come right on in.</i>

38:39.945 --> 38:42.447
What's this?

38:42.489 --> 38:47.870
That... is Battlin' Bob Satterfield.
Fightin' Joe Blow.

38:47.953 --> 38:50.205
Joe Blow.
You don't know who he's fighting?

38:50.289 --> 38:54.209
- I'm questioning those investigative skills there.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

38:54.293 --> 38:57.921
We got this off a collector.
It's the only one we could find.

38:59.798 --> 39:01.925
<i>Beautiful.</i>

39:03.135 --> 39:06.263
To be a reporter back then.
Can you imagine?

39:07.514 --> 39:10.100
You really are only as good
as the athletes you cover.

39:12.144 --> 39:14.605
Which one's Satterfield?

39:14.688 --> 39:17.774
He's, uh, this one here.

39:17.858 --> 39:19.818
- See the scar on his back?
- Mm-hmm.

39:19.902 --> 39:22.988
His dad gave him that when he was
nine years old. Can you believe that?

39:30.412 --> 39:32.956
Perfect. Perfect.

39:34.333 --> 39:36.293
Champ, how's it goin', man?

39:37.669 --> 39:40.297
Champ. What's up?

39:41.673 --> 39:44.551
Jesus Christ, man,
what happened to your eye?

39:49.014 --> 39:51.767
Those kids do that?

39:53.519 --> 39:57.105
- You probably need a drink, huh?
- I need a drink bad.

39:57.189 --> 39:59.942
These guys are gonna give you a drink
if you sweep up?

40:00.025 --> 40:03.612
Yeah. But they said the wind
done already done it.

40:03.695 --> 40:07.157
But sometime they change their mind.

40:07.241 --> 40:10.327
Champ, I'm gonna get you a drink.
But then I gotta show you something, okay?

40:10.369 --> 40:12.329
It's gonna blow your mind.

40:12.371 --> 40:16.667
<i>Hey.</i>

40:16.708 --> 40:18.669
I really appreciate it.

40:18.710 --> 40:22.381
<i>- So it's just two minutes long?
- Yeah, yeah. If that.</i>

40:27.010 --> 40:29.638
Hey, Champ. Champ.

40:50.534 --> 40:53.495
Who's that you're fightin' there,
Champ?

40:53.579 --> 40:57.916
Satterfield versus Kincaid.
Tommy Kincaid.

40:58.000 --> 41:01.336
Never had it in him to hurt a man.
That was his problem.

41:03.380 --> 41:06.842
<i>He had skills though.
He had a hammer!</i>

41:12.890 --> 41:15.726
Where'd you get this?

41:15.767 --> 41:19.897
Well, Champ, I'm a world-class
investigative journalist.

41:19.980 --> 41:21.940
This is what I do.

41:38.499 --> 41:41.502
<i>Is that the same guy?</i>

41:41.585 --> 41:43.921
<i>- Who? The guy on the tape?
- Yeah.</i>

41:43.962 --> 41:46.882
<i>- I can't tell.
- How y'all doin'?</i>

41:54.556 --> 41:57.559
Hey, can I get that back?

41:57.643 --> 41:59.603
<i>Could I- Quickly, actually.</i>

41:59.645 --> 42:04.107
Hey, Champ. Champ!

42:04.191 --> 42:06.527
Hey, you all right?

42:07.986 --> 42:11.281
I thought- I'm sorry.
I thought you'd like that.

42:14.326 --> 42:16.245
You got kids?

42:16.328 --> 42:20.666
Yeah, I got a six-year-old.
Boy. His name's Teddy.

42:21.708 --> 42:24.628
Well, I hope that one day, God willing...

42:24.670 --> 42:28.131
your son does for you
what you just done for me in there.

42:32.886 --> 42:34.972
Hey, wait, where you goin'?

42:35.055 --> 42:37.099
I thought that'd be a good line
to exit on.

42:37.182 --> 42:42.813
I- I still need more for my story.

42:48.777 --> 42:50.821
There's the-That-There.
That house right there.

42:50.863 --> 42:53.448
- Don't stop. Keep goin'.
- Why?

42:53.532 --> 42:55.993
Betty in there.
She come out here, she whoop us both.

42:56.076 --> 42:59.955
- Who's Betty?
- Betty used to be my wife.

43:00.038 --> 43:02.332
Well, she probably still is.

43:04.918 --> 43:07.004
I thought Iona was your wife.

43:07.087 --> 43:10.799
Iona was my first wife.
You got a wife?

43:12.217 --> 43:15.637
Yeah, I got a great wife. Joyce.

43:15.721 --> 43:18.265
We went to Columbia together.
She works at the paper too.

43:19.516 --> 43:22.144
She was a grad student,
I was a sophomore and-

43:24.021 --> 43:26.106
She got pregnant.

43:28.192 --> 43:30.152
We're separated now though.

43:30.235 --> 43:33.238
- Oh, she done kicked your ass out, huh?
- Yeah.

43:35.240 --> 43:38.035
What for?

43:38.118 --> 43:42.080
Champ, when I figure that out,
maybe I can fix it.

43:42.122 --> 43:46.293
Mmm. I'll tell ya, you know, w-w-women
ain't gonna never tell you what's wrong.

43:46.376 --> 43:49.171
And if you don't know,
that's just too bad.

43:49.254 --> 43:51.673
Yeah. That sounds about right.

43:53.383 --> 43:58.222
- You love your son?
- Yeah. Yes, very much. Very much.

43:58.263 --> 44:00.265
Yeah, you gots to love 'em, don't ya?

44:00.307 --> 44:03.101
Gotta love 'em more than anything
in this whole world!

44:03.185 --> 44:07.648
<i>You gotta love 'em, like-
How they say, um, mucho grande.</i>

44:09.191 --> 44:12.903
<i>- That's right. Mucho grande.
- Mucho grande.</i>

44:12.945 --> 44:18.909
My son, Bob Jr., with my first wife, Iona-
He tells everybody I'm dead.

44:18.951 --> 44:22.204
Why's that?

44:22.287 --> 44:26.875
Is he ashamed of you
because you live on the street, or-

44:26.959 --> 44:30.504
Oh, it's, uh, probably
'cause I left him and his mama.

44:32.798 --> 44:36.009
- Really? How old was he?
- Six.

44:36.093 --> 44:38.595
So, that was what, like,
40 years ago?

44:38.679 --> 44:43.600
I mean, come on, Junior, get over it.
Move on with your life.

44:46.645 --> 44:48.605
Mm-hmm.

44:50.899 --> 44:53.652
Yeah, I like to come back here
to-to-to Five Points...

44:53.735 --> 44:56.155
and-and just look at the house
and, uh, imagine Betty inside.

44:56.155 --> 44:59.658
and-and just look at the house
and, uh, imagine Betty inside.

45:00.742 --> 45:02.995
But-But-But I can't go in.

45:03.078 --> 45:05.789
My feet say go, but my head say no.

45:08.709 --> 45:12.087
Look. You have to promise me,
you ain't gonna mess with Betty, all right?

45:12.171 --> 45:15.465
'Cause if you do that, th-then you
be gettin' in my personal business.

45:15.549 --> 45:19.094
Okay. Okay.

45:19.178 --> 45:21.430
Promise.

45:21.513 --> 45:24.016
- Dad?
- Yeah, buddy?

45:24.099 --> 45:27.394
- What kind of dog is Snoopy?
- Uh, he's a beagle.

45:27.477 --> 45:31.106
- He doesn't look like a beagle.
- Well, that's what he is.

45:31.190 --> 45:34.651
Keith's got a beagle,
and she doesn't look like Snoopy at all.

45:34.735 --> 45:36.695
Oh, really? Thank you very much.

45:36.737 --> 45:38.906
- Is that true?
- Can we get a beagle?

45:38.989 --> 45:43.410
I don't think that's really my call.
Especially when I'm not in the house.

45:43.494 --> 45:45.704
- Here's your favorite table, sir.
- All right.

45:45.787 --> 45:49.082
Come on.
Let's get out of here.

45:49.166 --> 45:52.127
<i>Dad, look. John Elway.</i>

45:53.420 --> 45:56.757
Can I meet him, Dad?
Can I talk to him? Please, Dad?

45:57.799 --> 46:00.427
Um, you know what?

46:00.511 --> 46:03.514
It's really not that cool
to go up to celebrities in public.

46:03.597 --> 46:05.766
But he's not a celebrity.
He's your friend.

46:05.849 --> 46:09.186
Even still. Okay?

46:09.269 --> 46:12.022
Why can't you just talk to your friend?

46:14.775 --> 46:18.445
It's a grown-up thing, buddy.
Let's go see your mom. Grab your jacket.

46:21.240 --> 46:23.158
Come on. Let's go.

46:23.242 --> 46:25.160
Hey, hey, hey. Teddy.

46:25.244 --> 46:28.664
- Hi, Mr. Elway. I just came to say-
- Hey there, son.

46:28.747 --> 46:31.667
- Hey, John, how ya doin'? Sorry.
- Oh, no worries.

46:31.750 --> 46:33.460
<i>- What's your name?
- Teddy.</i>

46:33.544 --> 46:34.837
- Do you play football?
- Yeah.

46:34.920 --> 46:37.506
Except my hand's not big enough
to hold a real football.

46:37.589 --> 46:40.467
Let me see. Other hand.

46:42.344 --> 46:45.180
I give you three years. Your hand's
a lot bigger than mine was at your age.

46:45.264 --> 46:47.975
Well, we gotta go.
I'll-I'll say hi to Joyce, okay?

46:48.058 --> 46:49.351
- O-Okay.
- Bye, Mr. Elway.

46:49.434 --> 46:52.813
<i>I hope you go back
to the Broncos next year!</i>

46:56.191 --> 46:59.653
He's a really nice guy.
We could have stayed there longer.

46:59.736 --> 47:02.281
You know what, buddy?
That's just the way it is, okay?

47:02.364 --> 47:05.576
Come on. Get up there.

47:09.663 --> 47:11.623
You have all these cool friends...

47:11.665 --> 47:13.792
and I never get to meet any of them.

47:16.920 --> 47:21.341
You know what? You're right.
Let's fix that.

47:21.383 --> 47:24.553
Good ol' Rocky comes with another right,
and I go, boom, up like this!

47:24.636 --> 47:29.349
Yeah. That's just the way it happened too.

47:29.433 --> 47:34.104
Remember, Marciano was the only
heavyweight champ to retire undefeated.

47:34.188 --> 47:38.025
<i>- Wow.
- Yeah. He died in a plane crash.</i>

47:38.108 --> 47:43.822
Say, man, 'bout how old are you, huh?
What? Like, 15?

47:43.864 --> 47:47.326
- I'm six.
- Oh! You look 15.

47:47.409 --> 47:50.746
You wanna know how you grow up
to be big and strong like Champ?

47:51.872 --> 47:53.790
Every morning when you get up...

47:53.874 --> 47:57.628
gotta roll your sleeve up like this
and...

47:57.711 --> 48:00.047
blow.

48:00.130 --> 48:01.882
<i>Yep.</i>

48:01.965 --> 48:05.761
And-And-And-And see, it ain't so much
about how old you are, all right?

48:05.844 --> 48:07.846
It's-It's all about your conditioning.

48:07.930 --> 48:12.935
You got to build up your legs 'cause you
gonna need them for a long, long time.

48:13.018 --> 48:16.522
And-And you got to live right.
You have to live clean.

48:16.605 --> 48:21.151
And-And-And don't run-
Don't run around with the wrong crowd.

48:21.235 --> 48:25.155
<i>'Cause, because you can't do that.
Mmm-mmm-mmm.</i>

48:33.080 --> 48:35.040
Hey, Champ?

48:36.250 --> 48:37.251
<i>- Champ?
- Hmm?</i>

48:37.334 --> 48:39.545
<i>- You okay?
- Yeah! Yeah, yeah.</i>

48:39.628 --> 48:41.588
- You okay?
- Oh, yeah.

48:41.630 --> 48:44.925
Uh-uh-And-And, see, your dad-
Dad, he ain't perfect.

48:45.008 --> 48:47.761
But he's doin' the best he can.
Yeah.

48:47.845 --> 48:53.100
He been down and almost out.
But-But he loves you. Yes, he do.

48:53.183 --> 48:56.937
<i>And one day, he's gonna get his shot.</i>

49:00.107 --> 49:02.901
<i>So, if any of your friends don't believe
that you met him, you can...</i>

49:02.943 --> 49:05.696
<i>just tell them they can read my article
when it comes out in the Times.</i>

49:05.779 --> 49:08.740
- Okay.
- Okay.

49:11.910 --> 49:14.329
Hey, what's the matter?
You didn't like meeting Champ?

49:14.413 --> 49:17.124
- No, I did.
- Then what's the matter?

49:17.207 --> 49:20.627
I just don't like that Champ
lives on the street.

49:20.711 --> 49:23.922
Yeah, buddy,
I don't like that either.

49:24.006 --> 49:26.300
Maybe he could move in with us.

49:28.719 --> 49:31.388
Yeah, maybe you should
ask your mom about that one.

49:33.223 --> 49:35.142
<i>Local network was right behind us!</i>

49:35.225 --> 49:37.186
<i>Hey, Erik. Got something for ya.</i>

49:38.645 --> 49:39.855
Heard of this guy?

49:39.938 --> 49:43.859
Um, uh, yeah. I've heard-
I've heard of this guy.

49:43.942 --> 49:46.153
Good. He's the only one
Satterfield fought that I could find.

49:46.236 --> 49:49.490
Most of them are dead. I took the liberty
of setting up an interview time with him.

49:49.573 --> 49:51.492
- When?
- Today at 4:00.

49:52.701 --> 49:54.161
An interview with the Raging Bull.

49:54.244 --> 49:57.915
And... Satterfield Jr. of Chicago.

49:58.957 --> 50:01.627
Only living relative.

50:01.710 --> 50:04.963
- I could kiss you right now.
- I could sue you.

50:12.137 --> 50:14.056
Awesome.

50:31.073 --> 50:33.909
- Hello?
- Mr. Satterfield?

50:33.992 --> 50:34.660
<i>Yes?</i>

50:34.660 --> 50:38.956
<i>Hi, this is Erik Kernan of
The Denver Times. How ya doin'?</i>

50:39.039 --> 50:41.834
- Erik Kernan?
- Yes.

50:41.875 --> 50:44.920
I wanted to ask you a couple questions
about your father. Is that all right?

50:45.003 --> 50:47.339
- My father?
- Yeah.

50:47.381 --> 50:49.758
Fuck you.

51:03.564 --> 51:04.982
Erik Kernan.

51:05.065 --> 51:08.652
- Erik, hi, Bing Whitley.
- Hi, Bing, how are you?

51:08.735 --> 51:11.822
Good. Listen, I've got our beloved publisher,
Fred Roselle, here with me.

51:11.905 --> 51:14.950
- Can I put you on speaker?
- Yeah, uh, sure.

51:17.077 --> 51:21.248
<i>- Erik? Fred Roselle.
- Uh, hi, sir.</i>

51:21.331 --> 51:25.127
Now, Bing tells me
about your Satterfield story.

51:25.210 --> 51:29.339
Honest to God, it floored me.
I thought he died 20 years ago.

51:30.424 --> 51:32.718
- No, I see him every day.
- There you go.

51:32.801 --> 51:38.599
You see, I read 10 stories a week
about fighters in their glory years.

51:38.682 --> 51:40.726
But they never tell you
about the price they paid...

51:40.809 --> 51:42.978
taking all those shots to the head.

51:43.061 --> 51:45.355
Well, he definitely paid a price, sir.

51:45.439 --> 51:47.941
Yeah, well,
that's a story I'll go along with.

51:48.025 --> 51:51.403
Hell, I'll even get you
on the cover of the magazine.

51:52.821 --> 51:56.283
And Metz doesn't want any part
of this piece, is that right?

51:56.366 --> 51:59.161
No, he, uh- he called it a dry hole.

51:59.244 --> 52:01.163
That's just amazing.

52:01.246 --> 52:05.542
So, uh, any idea
how soon we could see it?

52:05.626 --> 52:10.255
- Well, I don't want to rush it.
- Of course not.

52:10.297 --> 52:13.550
Uh, so I guess-
I was thinking maybe two weeks?

52:13.634 --> 52:16.220
I have some interviews
I'd like to take care of and-

52:16.303 --> 52:19.640
We just dropped a retro piece on Gary Hart.
How about Monday?

52:21.058 --> 52:23.227
Yeah, sure.
Monday. I could manage that.

52:24.228 --> 52:26.271
Okay, beautiful.

52:37.032 --> 52:42.120
Hey. There he is.
Just give me a second, okay?

52:42.204 --> 52:44.039
Hey, Champ!

52:44.122 --> 52:46.291
Hey! Hey, kid! How ya doin'?

52:47.376 --> 52:49.461
- Just about 100%, Champ.
- A hundred percent?

52:49.545 --> 52:53.423
Whoo, I ain't been
a hundred percent in years.

52:53.507 --> 52:55.509
So, where's the photographer?

52:55.592 --> 52:58.303
He's just across the street.
But I just wanted to, um-

52:58.387 --> 53:03.058
I wanted to, uh- I got a friend of yours
who wants to talk to you.

53:03.141 --> 53:04.977
- I ain't know I had no friends.
- Sure, you do.

53:05.060 --> 53:07.229
Outside of you, that is.

53:07.312 --> 53:09.314
Well, let me prove you wrong.

53:09.398 --> 53:12.776
Hold on a sec.

53:16.363 --> 53:19.032
- Yeah?
- Mr. LaMotta?

53:19.116 --> 53:21.034
Who's this?

53:21.118 --> 53:23.745
<i>This is Erik Kernan of The Denver Times.
We spoke earlier.</i>

53:23.829 --> 53:27.958
Yeah. You said you wanted
to talk about Bob Satterfield.

53:28.041 --> 53:30.002
Jake-Jake,
I'm-I'm-I'm standing right here.

53:30.085 --> 53:32.963
Goddamn, Bob,
I thought you were dead!

53:33.046 --> 53:35.966
Well, some days I feel like it, yeah.

53:36.049 --> 53:38.260
<i>- Hey, kid?
- Yeah?</i>

53:38.343 --> 53:44.057
<i>Besides Bob Satterfield, the only ones
who ever hurt me were my ex-wives.</i>

53:44.141 --> 53:46.560
Is that right?

53:46.643 --> 53:50.063
Yeah. Well, you know,
it's really good to- How you say, uh-

53:50.105 --> 53:52.316
Um, uh-uh, talk to you.
How you doin'?

53:52.399 --> 53:56.987
I'm good. Real good.
Had some trouble, but I'm okay now.

53:57.070 --> 53:59.907
I know. I know. I-I-I seen your movie.

53:59.990 --> 54:02.409
<i>- You like it?
- Well, y-yeah.</i>

54:02.451 --> 54:05.454
Except for the part where you knock me out.

54:05.537 --> 54:08.916
Bob, you sure you're okay?

54:08.999 --> 54:14.421
The kid tells me you're out on the street.
You're a bum or something?

54:14.505 --> 54:19.259
No. No, no. I ain't no bum, Jake.
I'm, I-I'm just homeless.

54:19.343 --> 54:23.263
L-L-Look, I, uh-
I have to go, all right?

54:23.305 --> 54:26.850
<i>Okay. Bye, Bob.</i>

54:28.101 --> 54:31.230
- Thanks, Mr. LaMotta.
- Is he really okay?

54:32.231 --> 54:34.149
Yeah. I think so.

54:34.233 --> 54:37.528
I thought he was dead.
Boy, oh, boy.

54:37.611 --> 54:40.948
There but for the grace of God go I.

54:41.031 --> 54:43.951
Well, thanks a lot for speaking with me.

54:43.992 --> 54:45.953
- Okay.
- Bye.

54:47.287 --> 54:50.916
Champ!
He just said there was a time...

54:50.999 --> 54:53.877
where you could have been
the best boxer in the world.

54:54.002 --> 54:58.465
That's-That's really somethin'
comin' from the Raging Bull, huh?

55:01.134 --> 55:03.595
<i>Hey, Chris! We're ready!</i>

55:03.679 --> 55:06.473
<i>Denver is now just one
of three cities left in the running...</i>

55:06.557 --> 55:09.142
to host the 2008
Democratic National Convention.

55:09.184 --> 55:12.646
New Orleans has dropped out.
So, that leaves Denver, New York...

55:12.688 --> 55:14.773
and Minneapolis still in the race.

55:23.240 --> 55:25.951
Hey, Bruce! Bruce!
Can I take one of these?

55:26.034 --> 55:27.953
- Yeah, sure.
- Thanks a lot, man.

55:42.217 --> 55:45.012
<i>- Mom, it's here!
- Bring it in!</i>

55:51.435 --> 55:53.353
It should in the middle by the coupons.

55:55.481 --> 55:59.318
Ah, there. You got it. You got it.

55:59.401 --> 56:03.155
Cool! The Champ! That's the guy
I was talking to you about, remember?

56:03.238 --> 56:05.699
I know! What does that say?

56:05.782 --> 56:09.745
- Resurrec-
- What does that say?

56:09.828 --> 56:15.792
- By Erik Kernan. Cool.
- Yeah. Cool.

56:18.962 --> 56:21.507
<i>- Erik, great job on the article.
- Hey, thanks, Rob.</i>

56:32.768 --> 56:34.269
Hey, Ralph.

56:35.854 --> 56:38.774
<i>- Nice piece on this guy.
- Thanks.</i>

56:41.652 --> 56:43.570
Word is you're moving upstairs.

56:45.697 --> 56:47.825
Yeah. Maybe it's a better fit.

56:49.034 --> 56:51.036
Maybe.

56:52.246 --> 56:54.623
<i>Answer your phone, Erik.</i>

57:02.339 --> 57:04.299
Kernan.

57:04.341 --> 57:07.427
Hey, Boy Wonder, this is Andrea Flak.
How you doing?

57:07.469 --> 57:09.805
This was one holy-moly story you wrote.

57:09.888 --> 57:11.807
My team was on it lickety-split.

57:11.890 --> 57:13.976
You are on your way to a Pulitzer, Erik.

57:14.059 --> 57:16.436
And we want you here.

57:16.478 --> 57:19.314
How you feeling? Fan-damn-tastic?

57:19.398 --> 57:23.443
I'm good. I'm all right.
Yeah. Uh-Who are you with?

57:23.527 --> 57:26.738
What? Oh.
I'm with Showtime, yeah.

57:26.822 --> 57:30.826
Oh, God. I loved this article.
Made me cry.

57:30.909 --> 57:31.285
Mm-hmm.

57:31.285 --> 57:32.995
And trust me, that is a
considerable compliment...

57:33.078 --> 57:35.747
to your literary skills, 'cause I didn't cry
when my golden retriever died.

57:35.831 --> 57:39.668
- Be proud.
- Thank you. Thanks a lot.

57:39.710 --> 57:42.754
So I'm sure everyone wants a piece of you.
You must be swamped with calls.

57:42.838 --> 57:45.674
- Actually, you're my first.
- That's a surprise.

57:45.757 --> 57:47.676
Uh, looks like
I have some messages though.

57:47.759 --> 57:50.512
Erik, we want to give you a tryout
at Showtime Boxing-

57:50.596 --> 57:55.142
get you on the air, in Vegas, interview
Kid McCracken after the fight Saturday night.

57:55.184 --> 57:58.145
- Sound good to you?
- Yeah, yeah.

57:58.187 --> 58:00.564
That sounds, uh- sounds great.

58:00.647 --> 58:03.192
Beautiful. Get your tux dry-cleaned.

58:03.275 --> 58:05.194
We'll talk.

58:09.114 --> 58:12.367
You know, the syndication on this story
is pretty much through the roof.

58:12.409 --> 58:14.703
You made me look good, Erik.
You did. Thank you.

58:14.786 --> 58:17.664
<i>- Really. Thank you.
- Thank you, Bing. Thank you.</i>

58:17.748 --> 58:22.544
See, Erik, this is the kind of piece that can
get you places. You're gonna have offers.

58:22.628 --> 58:24.671
- You think so?
- Oh, yeah. You're gonna have offers.

58:24.755 --> 58:27.174
Now, all I ask is
for another year from you.

58:27.216 --> 58:29.176
I mean, uh, uh-

58:29.218 --> 58:32.137
- Hey.
- Hey. This is Polly. Polly, this is Bing.

58:32.221 --> 58:34.014
- Hi, Polly.
- Mr. Whitley, nice to meet you.

58:34.056 --> 58:36.683
- She works at the newspaper as well.
- Did I ever hit on you?

58:36.767 --> 58:39.728
- Uh, no.
- What was I thinking?

58:39.770 --> 58:42.898
<i>She's actually-
I couldn't have done this story without her.</i>

58:42.898 --> 58:43.232
Really?

58:43.273 --> 58:45.651
- She's the rising star of the newspaper.
- Really?

58:45.734 --> 58:49.571
Um, so, look.
Well, can the rising star get a dance?

58:49.613 --> 58:51.573
- Yeah, sure. Yeah. Okay-
- Okay.

58:51.657 --> 58:54.076
- Go ahead. Have fun.
- All right. I'll see you in a second.

58:54.117 --> 58:56.078
<i>- Bye.
- Nice meeting you.</i>

58:56.119 --> 58:58.914
<i>Okay.</i>

59:01.250 --> 59:04.419
- It's a great piece, Erik.
- Thank you.

59:04.503 --> 59:07.214
- You're welcome.
- Yeah.

59:07.256 --> 59:09.258
Metz, um- Metz got pretty pissed...

59:09.341 --> 59:11.677
when I told him I helped you with it.

59:11.760 --> 59:13.887
Why'd you tell him?

59:13.929 --> 59:16.765
Because it made me proud,
being involved in the piece.

59:19.017 --> 59:21.520
So, you gonna be
on Showtime now, or what?

59:23.188 --> 59:25.941
Well, they've been calling,
which is-

59:26.024 --> 59:28.944
- Not surprising.
- Amazing. Pretty amazing.

59:29.027 --> 59:31.029
Pretty amazing.

59:32.865 --> 59:35.284
What a night, right?

59:35.367 --> 59:37.286
What a night.

59:38.829 --> 59:40.789
What a night.

59:42.708 --> 59:46.128
Hey-Just give me-
Give me a minute, okay? I'll be-

59:46.211 --> 59:48.130
- I'll be back, all right?
- Yeah.

59:48.213 --> 59:50.465
Okay.

01:00:12.738 --> 01:00:15.574
Hey. Joyce, it's me.

01:00:17.576 --> 01:00:19.912
Hey, why don't you come out
and help me celebrate?

01:00:20.996 --> 01:00:23.165
Come on. It's early.

01:00:36.720 --> 01:00:37.054
So, um, let me ask you a question.

01:00:37.054 --> 01:00:40.140
So, um, let me ask you a question.

01:00:40.182 --> 01:00:42.142
Yep.

01:00:42.184 --> 01:00:45.187
Why didn't they use
the picture of me flexing?

01:00:45.229 --> 01:00:47.189
I don't know.

01:00:47.231 --> 01:00:50.025
Photo editor makes those calls. I-

01:00:50.108 --> 01:00:53.028
I tell you what.
I would've picked that one. Yeah.

01:00:53.070 --> 01:00:55.781
- Yeah, that's the one I would've used too.
- Really?

01:00:57.115 --> 01:00:59.117
So, we done good, huh?

01:01:00.285 --> 01:01:02.830
Yeah, we did great, Champ.

01:01:20.806 --> 01:01:22.891
Yeah? Hello?

01:01:22.975 --> 01:01:25.519
Is this Erik Kernan?

01:01:25.561 --> 01:01:29.731
Yeah. Who's this?

01:01:29.815 --> 01:01:32.234
My name's Ike Epstein.

01:01:32.317 --> 01:01:35.529
You write that article about Satterfield?

01:01:35.571 --> 01:01:38.740
- Yeah.
- Nice story.

01:01:38.824 --> 01:01:40.909
Mm-Thank you.

01:01:40.993 --> 01:01:45.414
But Satterfield's dead. Twenty years.

01:01:45.455 --> 01:01:48.542
Bob Satterfield died in, uh...

01:01:48.625 --> 01:01:50.586
'82, '83.

01:01:51.628 --> 01:01:53.672
I just saw him last night.

01:01:53.755 --> 01:01:56.508
Not Satterfield.

01:01:56.592 --> 01:01:59.261
Yeah, Satterfield. I-I-

01:01:59.303 --> 01:02:02.931
I spoke with his son... on the phone.

01:02:03.015 --> 01:02:05.392
His son told you he was alive?

01:02:05.434 --> 01:02:08.729
- No, but they don't get along-
- Let's get to the bottom of this.

01:02:08.770 --> 01:02:10.772
Okay.

01:02:13.192 --> 01:02:16.987
Did you talk to, uh...

01:02:17.070 --> 01:02:19.114
Satterfield's trainers?

01:02:20.449 --> 01:02:23.410
His ringmen? Anybody like that?

01:02:23.452 --> 01:02:26.205
Most of them-
I couldn't dig 'em up.

01:02:28.332 --> 01:02:30.292
Ernie...

01:02:30.334 --> 01:02:32.294
Ike Epstein.

01:02:34.338 --> 01:02:38.717
<i>I'm good. Ernie,
you remember Bob Satterfield...</i>

01:02:38.800 --> 01:02:40.719
Chicago boy?

01:02:40.802 --> 01:02:42.638
Mm-hmm.

01:02:43.972 --> 01:02:46.809
<i>Well, you think he's dead
or you know he's dead?</i>

01:02:46.850 --> 01:02:49.436
Ah, that's-that's what I think.

01:02:49.478 --> 01:02:51.438
<i>Okay.</i>

01:02:51.480 --> 01:02:54.191
Thanks. Take care of yourself.

01:02:55.192 --> 01:02:57.152
He thinks he's dead.

01:02:57.194 --> 01:02:59.655
<i>It's impossible.</i>

01:02:59.738 --> 01:03:02.491
Never use that word anymore.

01:03:11.667 --> 01:03:15.212
Freddy? Ike.

01:03:15.295 --> 01:03:19.091
Listen.
You remember Bob Satterfield?

01:03:21.009 --> 01:03:24.388
Yeah.
But do you know that for sure?

01:03:28.058 --> 01:03:31.103
Okay. Thanks.

01:03:31.186 --> 01:03:34.106
No, they're good.
Thank you. Thank you.

01:03:35.774 --> 01:03:39.027
He thinks he's dead,
but he's not sure.

01:03:39.069 --> 01:03:42.030
<i>- Who was that?
- Freddy Bingham.</i>

01:03:42.072 --> 01:03:45.742
Impossible.
Freddy Bingham is dead.

01:03:49.371 --> 01:03:51.540
I just talked to him on the telephone.

01:03:51.623 --> 01:03:53.542
It was Freddy Benjamin you talked to.

01:03:53.584 --> 01:03:55.878
<i>Freddy Benjamin is dead.</i>

01:03:55.961 --> 01:03:59.047
- Two years ago.
- I saw Freddy Benjamin last Christmas.

01:03:59.131 --> 01:04:01.633
<i>Freddy Benjamin is a putz.</i>

01:04:01.717 --> 01:04:04.052
Plus, he's dead.

01:04:05.262 --> 01:04:07.681
Like Satterfield.

01:04:20.235 --> 01:04:24.198
- Hey, Champ.
- Hey, amigo. Want something to eat?

01:04:24.281 --> 01:04:27.159
Uh, nah. How you doin'?

01:04:27.242 --> 01:04:30.913
Oh, about 80%. Oh, maybe 90% today.

01:04:30.996 --> 01:04:33.582
Yeah. Movin' up in the world, huh?

01:04:33.665 --> 01:04:37.085
Fella stopped by, gave me a hundred dollars.
Read the article in the paper.

01:04:37.127 --> 01:04:39.922
Champ, I got a question for you.

01:04:40.005 --> 01:04:42.257
It's important. Um-

01:04:42.341 --> 01:04:45.177
Do you have a... I. D?

01:04:45.260 --> 01:04:49.056
Anything with your-
Driver's license, maybe?

01:04:49.097 --> 01:04:51.058
What do you need that for?

01:04:51.099 --> 01:04:53.936
So that I can prove that you are
who you say you are.

01:04:53.977 --> 01:04:58.690
<i>I mean, this guy- this ex-boxing guy-
he-he thinks that you died, and-</i>

01:04:58.774 --> 01:05:02.361
Some mornings I wake up, I think I'm dead too.

01:05:02.444 --> 01:05:04.446
Yeah.

01:05:04.530 --> 01:05:09.952
No, seriously though.
I just- I need something, uh...

01:05:09.993 --> 01:05:14.623
that I can prove
that you're Bob Satterfield with.

01:05:16.458 --> 01:05:19.127
What did you say your name is again?

01:05:19.211 --> 01:05:21.129
Erik Kernan.

01:05:21.213 --> 01:05:22.047
Can you prove that?

01:05:22.047 --> 01:05:24.299
Well, I have a driver's
license with my picture on it.

01:05:24.383 --> 01:05:26.385
<i>- Well, who took that picture?
- The D.M.V.</i>

01:05:26.468 --> 01:05:29.972
And how did they know
you was who you said you was?

01:05:30.055 --> 01:05:33.267
Well, from my last driver's license
with my last picture on it.

01:05:33.308 --> 01:05:35.727
Oh! And who took that picture?

01:05:37.729 --> 01:05:40.149
You see where I'm going with this?

01:05:40.232 --> 01:05:42.276
No, Champ.

01:05:42.317 --> 01:05:45.112
I don't- I just-

01:05:45.154 --> 01:05:47.239
I need- How about a passport?

01:05:47.322 --> 01:05:51.827
Do you have a passport?
Um, any-

01:05:51.910 --> 01:05:53.996
I don't know.
Anything with your picture...

01:05:54.079 --> 01:05:56.081
and your name on it.

01:05:57.749 --> 01:06:01.670
<i>Denver Times!
"Resurrection of the Champ," by Erik Kernan.</i>

01:06:01.753 --> 01:06:04.631
- That's what I got.
- Yeah.

01:06:04.673 --> 01:06:07.509
Except for
that-that-that video you got.

01:06:13.056 --> 01:06:15.434
<i>Where'd you get this?</i>

01:06:15.517 --> 01:06:17.644
I have a great research assistant.

01:06:17.728 --> 01:06:21.190
Satterfield/Kincaid. I was there.

01:06:21.231 --> 01:06:23.442
No shit? You were there?

01:06:23.525 --> 01:06:26.028
<i>- Really?
- South Bend.</i>

01:06:26.111 --> 01:06:30.532
I went to all the Satterfield fights.
That boy could punch.

01:06:32.910 --> 01:06:35.287
I knew-
I mean, he showed me his scar.

01:06:35.370 --> 01:06:38.207
<i>His father did it to him when he
was nine years old. It's the same guy-</i>

01:06:38.290 --> 01:06:40.375
That's the man you interviewed?

01:06:40.459 --> 01:06:42.836
<i>- Yeah.
- The one with the scar? You're sure about that?</i>

01:06:42.878 --> 01:06:46.548
Yeah. Battlin' Bob Satterfield.

01:06:46.632 --> 01:06:48.550
That's Kincaid.

01:06:50.969 --> 01:06:54.014
- No-
- Satterfield's the other one.

01:06:56.099 --> 01:06:58.644
You've been had, son.

01:07:00.103 --> 01:07:01.980
Who would it hurt?

01:07:02.064 --> 01:07:04.066
You, for one.

01:07:05.317 --> 01:07:07.236
It wouldn't hurt me
if nobody knew about it.

01:07:07.319 --> 01:07:09.571
Oh, is that an option,
that nobody will know about it?

01:07:09.613 --> 01:07:11.573
Joyce, let me ask you a question, okay?

01:07:11.657 --> 01:07:15.536
How many newspapers print articles with
errors of fact in them every day in the U. S?

01:07:15.577 --> 01:07:18.914
It's already done, Joyce.

01:07:18.997 --> 01:07:21.500
It's printed. It's out there.

01:07:21.583 --> 01:07:23.919
Then print a retraction.

01:07:26.171 --> 01:07:30.050
I can't just do that.
People have sent in money to Champ.

01:07:30.092 --> 01:07:33.053
- Then give it back.
- I can't.

01:07:33.095 --> 01:07:35.222
I don't know
where half of it comes from.

01:07:39.184 --> 01:07:41.186
It's not just the money.

01:07:42.187 --> 01:07:44.398
The Showtime job?

01:07:46.108 --> 01:07:49.736
Joyce, the point of the article
is still true.

01:07:49.778 --> 01:07:52.948
Okay, Erik. It's a lie.

01:07:53.031 --> 01:07:57.077
I mean, if you profit by a lie,
then you're the same as a liar.

01:07:57.119 --> 01:07:59.204
<i>If you write a great story
but it's a lie...</i>

01:07:59.288 --> 01:08:01.748
<i>then you're just a liar
who writes great stories...</i>

01:08:01.832 --> 01:08:04.042
which is worse than an ordinary liar...

01:08:04.126 --> 01:08:07.045
because people who can write
ought to be better than your average liar.

01:08:07.129 --> 01:08:11.091
<i>So, you're a liar, and you let me down,
and you let everyone else...</i>

01:08:11.133 --> 01:08:13.969
who works on this paper down
because you ought to be better than that.

01:08:14.011 --> 01:08:15.971
Is that simple enough?

01:08:17.514 --> 01:08:20.309
<i>- No, Joyce, that's not simple enough.
- Then let me put it another way.</i>

01:08:20.350 --> 01:08:22.728
You need to behave
as if Teddy was watching.

01:08:43.749 --> 01:08:46.542
<i>And the winner, by a technical knockout...</i>

01:08:46.627 --> 01:08:51.756
<i>one minute, six seconds
into the second round, Leo McCracken!</i>

01:09:00.224 --> 01:09:03.268
Hey, Leo! Leo!

01:09:03.352 --> 01:09:05.520
Hey. So-

01:09:05.604 --> 01:09:07.648
Leo McCracken-

01:09:07.731 --> 01:09:11.568
Hey, Leo- Leo McCracken,
the new heavyweight champ-

01:09:11.652 --> 01:09:13.862
<i>Oh, look, look, look, look, look!
Who's that? Who's that?</i>

01:09:13.862 --> 01:09:14.613
<i>That's Daddy.</i>

01:09:14.696 --> 01:09:16.615
<i>- It's your Daddy?
- He lived up to his nickname tonight.</i>

01:09:16.698 --> 01:09:18.700
Say something to your fans.

01:09:18.742 --> 01:09:20.702
First- First I want to say
"Thank you, Jesus."

01:09:20.743 --> 01:09:22.912
I want to say thank you
to my trainer, Tommy McCracken...

01:09:22.996 --> 01:09:26.416
and my brother and father 'cause they
used to beat the living crap right out of me.

01:09:26.457 --> 01:09:29.920
And, Erik- Man, you always
believed in me, didn't you?

01:09:29.962 --> 01:09:33.090
- Hard not to believe in 22-0.
- Yeah, you did! Yeah! Whoo!

01:09:33.173 --> 01:09:35.091
- I get my mike back.
- Take that.

01:09:35.175 --> 01:09:37.094
- Thank you.
- Number one.

01:09:37.176 --> 01:09:39.595
<i>Looks like about all we're
gonna get out of him tonight.</i>

01:09:39.595 --> 01:09:40.055
<i>Number one!</i>

01:09:40.096 --> 01:09:43.517
It's gonna be a long night for Leo McCracken-
one of the best nights of his life.

01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:47.437
I love you, Teddy.

01:09:49.982 --> 01:09:52.109
<i>"I love you, Teddy. '"</i>

01:10:03.745 --> 01:10:06.623
<i>Hey. Hey.</i>

01:10:06.665 --> 01:10:08.709
Boy Wonder.

01:10:10.878 --> 01:10:13.046
You were terrific.

01:10:13.130 --> 01:10:14.923
Sit.

01:10:16.008 --> 01:10:18.051
Thanks, Miss Flak. I, uh-

01:10:18.135 --> 01:10:21.430
<i>That was fun.
That was a lot of fun.</i>

01:10:21.513 --> 01:10:23.974
<i>- Do you mind?
- No, not at all.</i>

01:10:24.057 --> 01:10:26.727
What a city. The only place
where you can do harm to yourself...

01:10:26.810 --> 01:10:28.896
and others
and smile all the way.

01:10:28.979 --> 01:10:32.816
"Fun." That's good.

01:10:32.900 --> 01:10:35.944
- Fun is what it's all about.
I'm glad you had a good time.

01:10:35.944 --> 01:10:37.112
I did. I did. I'm not-

01:10:37.196 --> 01:10:40.991
- You want a drink?
- Sure, yeah.

01:10:41.074 --> 01:10:44.161
<i>- I'll take a scotch on the rocks, please. Thank you.
- Yes, sir.</i>

01:10:44.244 --> 01:10:48.707
They're all watered down.
But they keep 'em coming, God bless.

01:10:48.790 --> 01:10:51.126
- Mmm. So-
- Yes?

01:10:51.210 --> 01:10:54.796
<i>Do you think we can turn this one-night
stand of ours into a torrid love affair?</i>

01:10:56.715 --> 01:11:00.469
I'd like that.
Very much, very much.

01:11:01.720 --> 01:11:04.807
Where's the smile, Erik?

01:11:04.890 --> 01:11:08.435
Well, I guess it's just that, uh...

01:11:08.519 --> 01:11:12.689
I'm not sure what I... actually did.

01:11:12.773 --> 01:11:15.984
You were great. Photogenic.

01:11:16.068 --> 01:11:18.904
Well, thank you.

01:11:18.987 --> 01:11:22.699
That's the beauty of television.
You don't have to do anything. Just be.

01:11:24.952 --> 01:11:29.790
So they tell me your old man was
some sort of boxing hotshot, a real poet.

01:11:29.873 --> 01:11:32.000
Yeah, yeah. He was, um-

01:11:32.084 --> 01:11:34.044
<i>- One scotch.
- Thank you.</i>

01:11:35.879 --> 01:11:41.343
So, if we're gonna do this,
if we're gonna make a deal...

01:11:41.426 --> 01:11:43.762
um-

01:11:43.846 --> 01:11:46.306
Of course I need to continue
with my journalism.

01:11:46.390 --> 01:11:51.728
Um- So I can only work part-time
at the most.

01:11:51.770 --> 01:11:56.650
<i>Well, this is a full-time gig, Erik,
with full-time pay.</i>

01:12:01.405 --> 01:12:03.866
Take a good look at me.
Are you looking?

01:12:03.949 --> 01:12:06.034
Yeah.

01:12:06.118 --> 01:12:08.829
Does it look like I know
the first thing about boxing?

01:12:08.912 --> 01:12:12.332
Does it look like I know the difference
between a hook and an uppercut...

01:12:12.416 --> 01:12:16.461
or what a standing eight count is
or what a holding penalty is?

01:12:16.545 --> 01:12:19.214
See, I don't have to know
what any of that is...

01:12:19.298 --> 01:12:22.759
because Showtime
has a parade of boxing experts.

01:12:22.843 --> 01:12:26.847
We spend a fortune being the best
in the world at this.

01:12:26.930 --> 01:12:29.183
But I am the head of casting, Erik...

01:12:29.266 --> 01:12:32.394
and I am here to help Showtime
do what it does best...

01:12:32.436 --> 01:12:35.898
and that is entertain the shit
out of its audience.

01:12:35.981 --> 01:12:40.235
Because in the end, absolutely everything
is about entertaining the audience.

01:12:44.281 --> 01:12:47.284
There is no journalism anymore.
There's no news.

01:12:47.367 --> 01:12:50.662
The people who cling to the hopes
that they can inform the world...

01:12:50.746 --> 01:12:53.207
are only slightly less naive
than the people who think...

01:12:53.290 --> 01:12:55.209
they can pray their way
out of a tsunami.

01:12:55.292 --> 01:12:59.630
<i>And do you know
the one thing people don't want?</i>

01:12:59.713 --> 01:13:02.132
Is the truth.

01:13:03.592 --> 01:13:05.969
<i>This guy who won-</i>

01:13:06.011 --> 01:13:07.971
McCracken.

01:13:08.055 --> 01:13:12.476
Do you think anybody really wants to know
how badly his brains got mangled tonight?

01:13:12.518 --> 01:13:15.979
How badly his manager
is gonna rip him off...

01:13:16.021 --> 01:13:18.398
or how bad his life's
gonna be in a few years?

01:13:18.482 --> 01:13:20.400
Maybe end up on the street
like your bum?

01:13:20.484 --> 01:13:23.403
The answer is "no."

01:13:25.405 --> 01:13:27.324
It's "no."

01:13:27.407 --> 01:13:30.744
Men want to see triumph,
and women, well-

01:13:30.828 --> 01:13:33.580
<i>Here you are,
with just enough credibility...</i>

01:13:33.664 --> 01:13:36.124
to make their husbands not resent you.

01:13:38.418 --> 01:13:40.838
Oh. That's-

01:13:42.464 --> 01:13:44.842
That doesn't sound
like much of a job at all.

01:13:44.883 --> 01:13:47.427
Well, it never does
until it actually is a job.

01:13:51.974 --> 01:13:53.892
Who's Teddy, by the way?

01:13:53.976 --> 01:13:56.478
<i>- He's my son. He's six.
- Mm.</i>

01:13:56.562 --> 01:13:59.690
- I bet he's a cutie-pie.
- He is.

01:13:59.773 --> 01:14:02.818
And proud as hell of you tonight.

01:14:05.988 --> 01:14:07.906
So...

01:14:07.990 --> 01:14:11.952
would you like to come
have a drink in my suite?

01:14:12.995 --> 01:14:15.789
No. You know what?

01:14:15.873 --> 01:14:18.292
I'm gonna catch the last flight out,
but thank you.

01:14:20.294 --> 01:14:22.963
Mm.

01:14:23.046 --> 01:14:24.965
Monday we'll talk.

01:14:41.982 --> 01:14:44.151
<i>Hey.</i>

01:14:44.234 --> 01:14:46.945
Hey.

01:14:48.739 --> 01:14:51.825
I took the last flight out.
Wanted to see if I could catch Teddy.

01:14:51.992 --> 01:14:55.537
All the lights were off.

01:14:55.621 --> 01:15:00.542
Well, not unusual at 1:00
in the morning.

01:15:01.835 --> 01:15:04.796
<i>- Did you let him watch it?
- Are you kidding?</i>

01:15:04.838 --> 01:15:07.966
Night of his life,
seeing his dad on Showtime.

01:15:12.054 --> 01:15:14.014
What'd you think? How'd I do?

01:15:14.056 --> 01:15:16.892
You did exactly
as I thought you would.

01:15:23.899 --> 01:15:26.443
Joyce, I can't get it off my brain.

01:15:29.154 --> 01:15:31.114
That's because you're decent.

01:15:37.412 --> 01:15:40.874
I'm gonna speak to Whitley tomorrow.

01:15:40.916 --> 01:15:44.169
I'm gonna drop the bomb on him.

01:15:44.211 --> 01:15:46.421
Good.

01:15:49.383 --> 01:15:51.385
I'm so fired.

01:15:52.427 --> 01:15:55.180
It's cold.

01:15:55.264 --> 01:15:57.683
I can make up the guest room.

01:16:03.063 --> 01:16:05.858
You know,
it seems like everybody I know...

01:16:05.941 --> 01:16:09.945
everybody I meet knows
"The Wow Man" except me.

01:16:12.781 --> 01:16:15.993
The only image I have of him...

01:16:16.076 --> 01:16:19.204
is a bus poster and some audiotapes.

01:16:21.290 --> 01:16:24.209
I don't want that to happen
to me and Teddy.

01:16:24.251 --> 01:16:27.379
I want to move back home, Joyce.

01:16:27.462 --> 01:16:29.548
I'll do whatever you want me to do.

01:16:29.631 --> 01:16:32.968
I'll... just do-

01:16:34.428 --> 01:16:37.389
I just want Teddy to know me.

01:16:37.431 --> 01:16:41.226
And you think because you're here,
he'll know who you are?

01:16:43.479 --> 01:16:46.482
You don't know whether to run away
from your dad or to chase after him...

01:16:46.565 --> 01:16:50.068
and the minute that you figure that out,
you're gonna stop running in circles.

01:16:54.448 --> 01:16:57.576
Seeing Whitley...

01:16:57.618 --> 01:16:59.578
it's the right thing.

01:17:04.833 --> 01:17:07.794
<i>Erik, you kicked ass on Showtime.
Congratulations.</i>

01:17:07.836 --> 01:17:09.838
<i>- Thanks.
- Don't forget the little people.</i>

01:17:13.300 --> 01:17:15.260
Erik.

01:17:18.138 --> 01:17:21.433
- Mr. Whitley, I wanted to-
- Come on in, would you?

01:17:21.475 --> 01:17:24.061
<i>... talk about my family.
I want everybody to know...</i>

01:17:24.144 --> 01:17:27.564
- that everything I've ever done with my life-
- Hello, Erik.

01:17:30.609 --> 01:17:32.986
I just want you to let me
do the talking. All right?

01:17:32.986 --> 01:17:34.238
Erik Kernan, Riley Washburn.

01:17:34.321 --> 01:17:36.240
It's a pleasure to meet you.

01:17:36.323 --> 01:17:38.951
I was a great fan of your dad's.

01:17:39.034 --> 01:17:42.621
I'd like you to meet my client,
Robert Satterfield. Erik Kernan.

01:17:45.374 --> 01:17:48.460
<i>I traveled all this way, Mr. Kernan...</i>

01:17:48.544 --> 01:17:52.047
to look into the eyes of the man
who dared to suggest in print...

01:17:53.382 --> 01:17:55.634
that I was ashamed of my father.

01:17:55.676 --> 01:17:59.138
The man you've been interviewing-
Tommy Kincaid-

01:17:59.221 --> 01:18:01.890
<i>has been impersonating
Bob Satterfield for years...</i>

01:18:01.974 --> 01:18:04.893
fraudulently fought under his name
for years.

01:18:04.977 --> 01:18:08.981
<i>There was even an injunction
brought against him way back when.</i>

01:18:10.732 --> 01:18:13.569
We've come to sue your ass
right off its hinges, Mr. Kernan-

01:18:13.652 --> 01:18:17.656
<i>you and this newspaper.</i>

01:18:20.534 --> 01:18:23.662
<i>The author of the piece
in The Denver Times is Erik Kernan Jr...</i>

01:18:23.704 --> 01:18:27.666
the son of the legendary radio
sports reporter of the same name.

01:18:27.749 --> 01:18:33.297
<i>Kernan, who recently began a broadcasting
career, has not returned calls to ESPN News.</i>

01:18:33.380 --> 01:18:37.468
Reporters must be held
to a higher degree of accountability.

01:18:37.551 --> 01:18:40.179
<i>Apologies don't-
Apologies can't fix some things.</i>

01:18:40.262 --> 01:18:42.973
<i>You can't go around saying
things you did not follow up on.</i>

01:18:43.432 --> 01:18:46.477
<i>- Great. Great.
- Nursing your wounds with a little whiskey.</i>

01:18:46.560 --> 01:18:47.686
There's a cliché for you.

01:18:47.686 --> 01:18:49.813
Well, what would you
expect from a writer like me?

01:18:49.897 --> 01:18:52.357
- Right, Ralph?
- Yeah, perfect.

01:18:52.441 --> 01:18:54.818
A little humility.
And it's precisely too late-

01:18:54.902 --> 01:18:56.695
Hey, you know what? Could
we change this channel?

01:18:56.695 --> 01:18:57.321
Yeah, no problem.

01:18:57.404 --> 01:19:01.200
Just change it to, like,
Golf Channel or something.

01:19:01.283 --> 01:19:04.536
So, Showtime, huh?

01:19:04.620 --> 01:19:07.623
I saw you. You were good.
You're a natural.

01:19:12.377 --> 01:19:14.463
You know what bothers me the most?

01:19:14.546 --> 01:19:17.549
What's that, Ralph?

01:19:17.633 --> 01:19:20.886
I only found out about this piece
when it came out.

01:19:20.928 --> 01:19:24.389
You deceived me.
You set out to deceive me.

01:19:26.475 --> 01:19:28.644
That hurts my feelings.

01:19:28.727 --> 01:19:32.981
Ah, come on, Ralph.
Don't get like a chick on me.

01:19:41.990 --> 01:19:44.743
The magazine is gonna
have to print a retraction.

01:19:44.827 --> 01:19:47.246
How big, I don't know.

01:19:47.329 --> 01:19:49.540
And Satterfield Jr.
is going to want money.

01:19:49.623 --> 01:19:51.583
<i>- Could I get another one? Thanks.
- Yeah, just a sec.</i>

01:19:51.667 --> 01:19:53.752
- And S-Are you listening to me?
- Yep.

01:19:53.836 --> 01:19:56.797
- I'm over here. Look at me.
- Yes, sir.

01:19:57.840 --> 01:19:59.800
There's gonna be a settlement meeting...

01:19:59.842 --> 01:20:02.177
at 3:30 tomorrow afternoon.

01:20:02.261 --> 01:20:04.179
You're expected to be there.

01:20:05.264 --> 01:20:06.807
Okay.

01:20:10.519 --> 01:20:12.479
You know,
Whitley's gonna be out on his ass...

01:20:12.521 --> 01:20:14.481
on account of this-
his watch and all that.

01:20:14.523 --> 01:20:16.692
And there's gonna be an internal review.

01:20:16.775 --> 01:20:19.111
We're gonna wanna talk to your wife.

01:20:20.112 --> 01:20:21.864
What are you talking about?

01:20:21.947 --> 01:20:24.032
We want to make sure Joyce didn't
have something to do with this.

01:20:24.116 --> 01:20:26.577
You know Joyce didn't have anything
to do with this. I didn't know about this.

01:20:26.660 --> 01:20:29.621
Joyce is a brilliant journalist.

01:20:29.705 --> 01:20:34.126
It'd be a damn shame if you somehow
sucked her down to your level.

01:20:34.168 --> 01:20:36.670
Tell me.

01:20:36.712 --> 01:20:40.757
Was it just sloppy journalism,
or did-did you know it was a lie?

01:20:40.841 --> 01:20:41.300
What?

01:20:41.300 --> 01:20:45.429
Yeah. Whatever it took to be
worthy of your last name, right?

01:20:45.512 --> 01:20:48.724
Here's- Here. Look.

01:20:48.807 --> 01:20:54.062
<i>That's Satterfield's obituary.
The Chicago Defender.</i>

01:20:54.146 --> 01:20:56.773
A black paper.
Misfiled, but it was there.

01:20:58.233 --> 01:21:01.069
You ought to resign.
Save the paper the hassle of firing you.

01:21:01.153 --> 01:21:03.113
That's for the bum.

01:21:04.406 --> 01:21:06.742
People have been
sending him dough for days.

01:21:08.035 --> 01:21:09.953
Ralph, he's not a bum.

01:21:10.037 --> 01:21:12.331
He's homeless.

01:21:12.414 --> 01:21:14.374
Nah, he's a bum.

01:21:31.600 --> 01:21:34.061
- Champ.
- Hey, kid, how ya doin'?

01:21:34.102 --> 01:21:36.104
- This is for you.
- What's that?

01:21:36.188 --> 01:21:39.024
Open it.

01:21:39.066 --> 01:21:42.444
People who read your article
sent it in. It's for you.

01:21:43.195 --> 01:21:45.656
It's for poor Bob Satterfield.

01:21:45.739 --> 01:21:48.534
Well, people can be nice.

01:21:50.869 --> 01:21:52.788
You're not Bob Satterfield.

01:21:52.871 --> 01:21:54.623
Who says?

01:21:54.706 --> 01:21:56.667
His son, for one.

01:21:56.750 --> 01:21:58.877
Yeah, well, he always
telling people I'm dead.

01:21:58.919 --> 01:22:02.339
<i>The Chicago Defender.
Ike Epstein. You know him?</i>

01:22:02.422 --> 01:22:05.801
- Sure, I know Ike! How he doin'?
- He saw the tape, Champ.

01:22:06.927 --> 01:22:08.846
You're Tommy Kincaid.

01:22:10.597 --> 01:22:13.809
Bob Satterfield knocked you out
in the second round!

01:22:16.436 --> 01:22:18.814
<i>You made a fool out of me.</i>

01:22:18.897 --> 01:22:21.733
I didn't make no fool out of you.
Maybe you made a fool out yourself.

01:22:21.775 --> 01:22:25.320
Why, because I believed you?
You put my reputation on the line!

01:22:25.404 --> 01:22:27.489
I didn't know you had one.
I ain't never heard of you.

01:22:27.573 --> 01:22:30.033
Yeah, well,
I never heard of you either.

01:22:30.117 --> 01:22:32.536
- I'm Battlin' Bob Satterfield.
- Bullshit! Bullshit!

01:22:32.619 --> 01:22:35.914
I've been Satterfield longer than
you been whoever you say you is.

01:22:37.332 --> 01:22:41.837
Now just go on.
Ain't nothin' else here for you.

01:22:41.920 --> 01:22:43.922
I can't believe I let
another loser break my heart.

01:22:44.006 --> 01:22:46.925
<i>I ain't no loser.
I fought Ezzard Charles.</i>

01:22:47.009 --> 01:22:50.929
I-I-I fought Harold Johnson
at the Polo Grounds.

01:22:51.013 --> 01:22:54.558
Went the distance with Floyd Patterson.
I-I-I broke Marciano's nose!

01:22:54.641 --> 01:22:58.187
- You're nothing. You're nobody.
- What you doin', kid? It's over.

01:22:58.270 --> 01:23:00.230
- Just go home, okay?
- You're just another stumblebum!

01:23:04.818 --> 01:23:07.446
<i>Um, um, hi.</i>

01:23:07.529 --> 01:23:10.032
<i>400 block of Curtis-</i>

01:23:10.115 --> 01:23:15.704
<i>Yeah. Yeah, there's- He got knocked out,
and the guy's down. He's down on the ground.</i>

01:23:15.787 --> 01:23:17.789
It's a homeless guy.
Tell them-

01:23:17.873 --> 01:23:19.791
Uh, yeah, this guy with a cart-

01:23:31.553 --> 01:23:34.306
<i>Because I work
for The Denver Times, and he's just-</i>

01:23:34.389 --> 01:23:37.392
<i>He-He was a- He was a homeless man,
and he was an ex-boxer...</i>

01:23:37.476 --> 01:23:39.645
<i>and, I don't know,
I thought it was a good story.</i>

01:23:39.728 --> 01:23:42.856
- Oh, yeah, you're that, uh- that writer guy.
- Yeah. I'm that writer guy.

01:23:42.940 --> 01:23:45.108
And I want to press charges,
okay, because the man is-

01:23:45.108 --> 01:23:45.943
Officer, um, excuse me.

01:23:46.026 --> 01:23:49.822
- I'm sorry. My-
- He's a threat to the community, is what he is.

01:23:49.905 --> 01:23:52.157
- My husband is heavily medicated.
- I want him locked up.

01:23:52.241 --> 01:23:54.660
He can't be expected to make
critical judgments at this time.

01:23:54.743 --> 01:23:56.912
<i>We'll let you know when
he starts making sense.</i>

01:23:56.912 --> 01:23:57.162
Okay.

01:23:59.581 --> 01:24:03.669
Okay. Uh, top one's from Showtime.

01:24:15.389 --> 01:24:17.391
What?

01:24:19.434 --> 01:24:21.186
Nothing.

01:24:21.270 --> 01:24:25.482
Joyce, I don't need this right now, okay?

01:24:25.566 --> 01:24:27.818
I don't need a lecture. All right?

01:24:30.404 --> 01:24:34.449
I know I screwed up.
It's all on me, okay?

01:24:34.533 --> 01:24:36.451
I'll take care of it myself.

01:24:36.535 --> 01:24:39.872
<i>Oh, well, you certainly demonstrated
that you can handle yourself just fine.</i>

01:24:39.913 --> 01:24:41.874
I mean, I get drunk and pick fights...

01:24:41.915 --> 01:24:44.376
<i>with professional boxers when I'm upset too.</i>

01:24:44.418 --> 01:24:46.545
Yeah.

01:24:46.628 --> 01:24:49.506
What do you want? What?

01:24:49.590 --> 01:24:52.885
<i>I mean- Okay.</i>

01:24:52.926 --> 01:24:55.471
I'm a monumental screw-up.

01:24:56.763 --> 01:24:59.475
There. Alert the media.

01:24:59.558 --> 01:25:02.519
Oh, that's long done.
It's all over the wires.

01:25:02.603 --> 01:25:06.899
<i>Kernan, the great name in journalism, sullied.</i>

01:25:06.982 --> 01:25:09.234
<i>The Rocky Mountain News
and the Post have essays...</i>

01:25:09.318 --> 01:25:14.072
<i>on your quote-unquote "colossal blunder'"
on the front page tomorrow.</i>

01:25:14.156 --> 01:25:15.824
Great.

01:25:17.326 --> 01:25:19.244
I went to see him.

01:25:20.287 --> 01:25:22.664
<i>At the jailhouse.</i>

01:25:22.748 --> 01:25:25.000
He wouldn't talk to me.

01:25:26.835 --> 01:25:29.421
He wouldn't talk to the other reporters
camped out at the jail either.

01:25:29.505 --> 01:25:31.757
See, he's protecting your byline.

01:25:31.840 --> 01:25:34.384
He still thinks he's helping his friend.

01:25:34.468 --> 01:25:36.512
He humiliated me.

01:25:36.595 --> 01:25:39.139
<i>He lied to you. That's his fault.</i>

01:25:39.223 --> 01:25:42.935
You're a journalist.
You believed him. That's your fault.

01:25:43.018 --> 01:25:47.606
<i>Not to mention the fact that you're a boxing
beat reporter on a major American daily...</i>

01:25:47.689 --> 01:25:52.194
and until a few weeks ago,
you didn't know who Bob Satterfield was.

01:25:54.196 --> 01:25:57.533
<i>Look, Erik. You have a chance
to forgive this old man.</i>

01:25:58.659 --> 01:26:00.577
<i>Take it.</i>

01:26:01.829 --> 01:26:03.789
Okay, I'll take it.

01:26:20.055 --> 01:26:22.432
You owe me. Remember that.

01:26:22.516 --> 01:26:24.476
I'll remember.

01:26:35.195 --> 01:26:36.655
Nice suit.

01:26:36.738 --> 01:26:40.117
Yeah, the Salvation Army gives them
to the police department.

01:26:40.200 --> 01:26:42.411
But I think they're knockoffs,
'cause this say "Omani."

01:26:42.494 --> 01:26:44.413
Armani starts with a "A," right?

01:26:44.496 --> 01:26:47.082
You have anywhere in particular
you want to go?

01:27:37.591 --> 01:27:40.344
This, uh-This don't belong to me.

01:27:40.427 --> 01:27:42.429
It belongs to Bob Satterfield.

01:27:43.722 --> 01:27:45.641
Satterfield's dead.

01:27:45.724 --> 01:27:47.726
Well, do what you want to with it.

01:27:55.776 --> 01:27:58.070
Might as well keep it.

01:27:58.111 --> 01:28:01.240
<i>- I ain't Satterfield now.
- I know.</i>

01:28:01.323 --> 01:28:03.575
All right. As long as you know.

01:28:19.842 --> 01:28:22.845
<i>That fella in, uh, Sioux City-</i>

01:28:24.012 --> 01:28:26.181
He come to me
and say I look like him.

01:28:26.265 --> 01:28:26.932
<i>Hey, Tommy.</i>

01:28:26.932 --> 01:28:28.934
And if I fought as him
I could make some money.

01:28:29.017 --> 01:28:32.479
The boys tell me you used to box
before you came here.

01:28:32.521 --> 01:28:36.066
<i>- 'Cause he had a name.
- From Chicago, Illinois...</i>

01:28:36.150 --> 01:28:39.987
Battling Bob Satterfield!

01:28:41.613 --> 01:28:43.532
<i>So I did it.</i>

01:28:43.615 --> 01:28:46.118
<i>Don't nobody know no better.</i>

01:28:48.120 --> 01:28:52.124
<i>And-And I was a winner
for the first time in my life.</i>

01:28:52.207 --> 01:28:54.209
<i>I wasn't me no more.</i>

01:28:55.335 --> 01:28:58.213
<i>I was- I was Satterfield, see?</i>

01:28:59.381 --> 01:29:01.884
I was somebody better.

01:29:01.967 --> 01:29:04.636
Better than my own self.

01:29:04.678 --> 01:29:06.305
<i>Whoo!</i>

01:29:06.346 --> 01:29:08.348
<i>I became Champ.</i>

01:29:10.309 --> 01:29:14.980
When I got done fighting,
I moved down here and, uh...

01:29:15.063 --> 01:29:18.025
met Betty, had a son by her.

01:29:20.068 --> 01:29:22.946
But you never see where
that next punch is comin' from.

01:29:25.365 --> 01:29:27.284
<i>What do you mean?</i>

01:29:27.367 --> 01:29:31.079
Well, my son, he found out.

01:29:32.414 --> 01:29:34.374
<i>Found an old Ring magazine.</i>

01:29:34.416 --> 01:29:37.753
"You ain't Satterfield!"
That's what he said.

01:29:39.004 --> 01:29:42.007
He didn't want nothin'
to do with me after that.

01:29:42.090 --> 01:29:44.760
Joined a gang, got hisself killed.

01:29:49.598 --> 01:29:51.767
I couldn't go back to Betty behind that.

01:30:01.276 --> 01:30:05.030
Well, Tommy, I wish you would've
told all this to me before.

01:30:05.072 --> 01:30:07.950
Yeah.
I give you the man you wanted.

01:30:09.910 --> 01:30:12.871
You-You said you wanted your shot.

01:30:12.913 --> 01:30:15.624
<i>That's what you said to me,
remember?</i>

01:30:25.634 --> 01:30:28.971
My father left me when I was a little kid.
Did I ever tell you that?

01:30:29.054 --> 01:30:32.015
- Not that I recall, no.
- Yeah, well, he did.

01:30:33.433 --> 01:30:35.394
He left me and my mom.

01:30:38.480 --> 01:30:40.649
They were never really right
for each other.

01:30:42.651 --> 01:30:45.863
He was a lot older than she was,
and-

01:30:48.991 --> 01:30:51.326
He left.

01:30:51.410 --> 01:30:54.288
The only thing I really remember is...

01:30:54.329 --> 01:30:57.291
it made my mom cry.

01:30:57.332 --> 01:31:01.003
He never called. He never wrote.

01:31:05.340 --> 01:31:07.384
And I hate him for it.

01:31:09.595 --> 01:31:12.306
And I didn't run wild like your boy.

01:31:17.686 --> 01:31:19.646
I just...

01:31:19.688 --> 01:31:22.274
thought I would try and be
a better father to my son.

01:31:23.317 --> 01:31:25.527
Try and be a hero to him.

01:31:29.114 --> 01:31:31.533
'Cause every kid wants to think
his father's the best, right?

01:31:31.617 --> 01:31:33.535
Yeah, that's right.

01:31:36.371 --> 01:31:38.332
So, what you gonna do now?

01:31:42.002 --> 01:31:44.797
Uh-

01:31:44.838 --> 01:31:49.301
In about an hour I gotta go over
to my kid's school and-

01:31:49.384 --> 01:31:51.345
Career Day.

01:31:51.386 --> 01:31:53.722
Career Day? What's that?

01:31:53.806 --> 01:31:57.184
Well, I'm gonna tell a bunch of six-year-olds
what it means to be a journalist.

01:31:57.267 --> 01:32:01.188
- Oh, irony!
- Yeah. Exactly.

01:32:06.360 --> 01:32:09.321
You, uh, think
she'll take me back, let me in?

01:32:12.366 --> 01:32:14.952
I don't know, Champ,
but I think you gotta try.

01:32:15.035 --> 01:32:17.412
I gotta think on what to say.

01:32:19.248 --> 01:32:21.917
<i>I don't think you have to
say anything. Just go in.</i>

01:32:27.422 --> 01:32:31.093
Just for the record,
that thing about Marciano-

01:32:31.176 --> 01:32:33.679
That's the truth.
I was his sparring partner.

01:32:33.762 --> 01:32:36.098
Busted his nose.

01:32:36.181 --> 01:32:38.934
- Not the big bone, but the little one.
- Yeah.

01:33:10.090 --> 01:33:12.384
<i>My dad's name is Erik Kernan Jr.</i>

01:33:12.468 --> 01:33:15.679
<i>He writes for newspapers.
And he's also on Showtime.</i>

01:33:15.762 --> 01:33:18.223
My dad's been up for the Pu-
the "Publitzer."

01:33:18.307 --> 01:33:20.350
- Pulitzer.
- The Pulitzer.

01:33:20.434 --> 01:33:23.729
<i>Meaning that he's one
of the best writers in America.</i>

01:33:23.770 --> 01:33:27.900
My dad writes about boxing
'cause he can't write about football...

01:33:27.983 --> 01:33:32.070
<i>'cause he's, like,
best friends with John Elway...</i>

01:33:32.154 --> 01:33:34.573
and, uh, Coach Shanahan.

01:33:34.615 --> 01:33:36.950
<i>He even plays golf with Muhammad Ali.</i>

01:33:37.034 --> 01:33:40.579
<i>And he turned down, like,
being a guy on Monday Night Football.</i>

01:33:40.662 --> 01:33:44.249
<i>- And also-
- Teddy, why don't we ask your dad to come up?</i>

01:33:44.291 --> 01:33:46.043
Okay. Dad?

01:33:56.136 --> 01:34:00.098
<i>- Hi, kids.
- Hi.</i>

01:34:00.182 --> 01:34:04.770
Um, I g-
I suppose we should just, uh...

01:34:04.853 --> 01:34:06.939
ask you if you have any questions.

01:34:11.652 --> 01:34:16.114
- Okay. Yeah?
- Who's better at golf, you or Muhammad Ali?

01:34:16.156 --> 01:34:18.283
Um-

01:34:19.493 --> 01:34:22.329
<i>Uh, well, why don't we, uh-</i>

01:34:22.412 --> 01:34:25.749
Maybe we'd be better served
if we just talked about...

01:34:25.833 --> 01:34:27.751
what it means to be a journalist.

01:34:27.835 --> 01:34:30.546
<i>How about that?
Go ahead. Yeah.</i>

01:34:30.629 --> 01:34:34.258
- Are you gonna change your last name?
- Change my name?

01:34:34.341 --> 01:34:37.970
My dad said you should change your last name
because you don't deserve it.

01:34:38.053 --> 01:34:41.390
<i>He says your dad was really great
and stuff, and you're a faker.</i>

01:34:41.473 --> 01:34:44.434
<i>On the TV, they said you made up
a story about a boxer.</i>

01:34:44.518 --> 01:34:46.478
<i>Uh, kids...</i>

01:34:46.562 --> 01:34:48.772
<i>maybe Mr. Kernan can explain to us...</i>

01:34:48.856 --> 01:34:52.151
how fast he has to turn in a story
after the sporting event has ended.

01:34:56.405 --> 01:34:58.615
That's a very good question.

01:34:58.699 --> 01:35:04.121
<i>Usually I'll turn in a story about two hours
after I see the event, because, um-</i>

01:35:06.081 --> 01:35:08.041
I wish I were dead.

01:35:09.084 --> 01:35:11.837
He's six. He'll bounce back.

01:35:15.716 --> 01:35:18.260
Look, this boy, he loves you.

01:35:19.928 --> 01:35:24.016
He knows that you're not a liar.
He- He believes in you.

01:35:24.099 --> 01:35:27.936
He'll be home in an hour.
Why don't you come by and talk to him?

01:35:34.443 --> 01:35:36.612
I can't.

01:35:37.738 --> 01:35:39.990
I gotta go
to that settlement conference.

01:35:40.991 --> 01:35:42.951
Round out a perfect day.

01:35:46.038 --> 01:35:48.624
But I'll be fine.

01:35:48.707 --> 01:35:50.626
I'll be fantastic.

01:35:52.628 --> 01:35:55.214
They really broke the mold with me, huh?

01:35:58.258 --> 01:36:00.385
Bob Satterfield
was not simply a great boxer.

01:36:00.469 --> 01:36:03.138
He was an icon-
truly an American icon.

01:36:03.222 --> 01:36:05.224
And to have his name
brought into disrepute-

01:36:05.265 --> 01:36:08.477
Okay, but that's not the issue.
I mean, you can't libel the dead.

01:36:08.560 --> 01:36:12.022
Riley, we're embarrassed by what happened.
We'll print a retraction.

01:36:12.105 --> 01:36:14.066
Nobody reads retractions.
You know that.

01:36:14.149 --> 01:36:16.235
<i>They read the lie, the lie sticks.</i>

01:36:16.276 --> 01:36:19.696
Look. Mr. Kernan is here
to offer his profound apologies...

01:36:19.780 --> 01:36:22.157
<i>to you and your family,
Mr. Satterfield.</i>

01:36:25.285 --> 01:36:27.246
<i>Erik.</i>

01:36:30.123 --> 01:36:33.127
I'm responsible, Mr. Satterfield.

01:36:35.003 --> 01:36:37.339
I was careless.

01:36:38.674 --> 01:36:41.718
And worse than that...

01:36:41.802 --> 01:36:44.555
after the story ran,
I had reason to believe...

01:36:44.638 --> 01:36:47.266
that it was wrong,
and I didn't speak up.

01:36:48.600 --> 01:36:51.019
<i>I know that I can't undo the damage...</i>

01:36:52.312 --> 01:36:54.231
but I'd like to try.

01:36:54.314 --> 01:36:56.608
Try in what way?

01:36:56.692 --> 01:36:59.069
The only way that I know how.
I'd write about it.

01:36:59.153 --> 01:37:01.071
And say what?

01:37:01.155 --> 01:37:03.615
I'd say that I made a mistake.
I'd say why.

01:37:03.657 --> 01:37:05.742
<i>That-</i>

01:37:05.826 --> 01:37:09.288
I'd talk about your father.
I'd talk about who he really was.

01:37:09.371 --> 01:37:11.290
Let's talk about damages,
Miss Perlmutter.

01:37:12.833 --> 01:37:15.961
<i>Bob Satterfield was a great figure
in American sports.</i>

01:37:16.044 --> 01:37:18.505
Nah, he wasn't none of that.

01:37:21.550 --> 01:37:24.887
He a pretty good boxer
with a glass jaw.

01:37:27.389 --> 01:37:29.558
But he was a very good man.

01:37:31.059 --> 01:37:34.438
And a good father, and I'd-
I'd like for people to know that.

01:37:34.521 --> 01:37:36.482
<i>Would you put that in your story?</i>

01:37:36.565 --> 01:37:39.485
I would. I would.

01:37:39.526 --> 01:37:42.779
<i>When you called me, I hung up on you.</i>

01:37:42.863 --> 01:37:46.408
You said you was Erik Kernan.
You didn't say that you was a "Junior."

01:37:47.910 --> 01:37:50.871
Your old man hit my dad
with some pretty big shots in his time.

01:37:54.917 --> 01:37:57.795
I'd like to read your story.

01:37:57.878 --> 01:38:00.756
I think it'd go a long way
in making me satisfied.

01:38:25.072 --> 01:38:27.449
Jesus Christ, I get it already!

01:38:43.632 --> 01:38:45.884
Hey. I've been trying to reach you.

01:38:45.968 --> 01:38:48.637
I know. I, uh-

01:38:50.973 --> 01:38:53.976
<i>Did you hear about the deal?
I'm gonna write this-</i>

01:38:54.059 --> 01:38:55.561
Yeah, I-I heard.

01:38:57.312 --> 01:38:59.982
Is Teddy awake?

01:39:00.065 --> 01:39:02.401
He says he's not feeling well...

01:39:02.484 --> 01:39:06.155
and, uh, he doesn't want
to go to school tomorrow.

01:39:06.238 --> 01:39:10.742
Can I speak with him? Could I come in?
I really need to talk to him.

01:39:11.952 --> 01:39:13.912
Yeah.

01:39:24.631 --> 01:39:27.926
Hey, buddy. Hey, man.

01:39:29.136 --> 01:39:31.054
Daddy?

01:39:31.138 --> 01:39:33.015
Hey.

01:39:38.604 --> 01:39:40.772
Are the kids in your class
giving you a hard time?

01:39:43.692 --> 01:39:46.278
Yeah.

01:39:46.361 --> 01:39:49.948
Everybody says
you made it up about Champ.

01:39:53.535 --> 01:39:55.704
I made some mistakes, Teddy.

01:39:58.499 --> 01:40:00.459
I made a lot of mistakes.

01:40:01.668 --> 01:40:04.046
But did you make it up?

01:40:06.381 --> 01:40:08.342
The truth is...

01:40:10.969 --> 01:40:12.930
I wrote what Champ told me.

01:40:14.389 --> 01:40:16.642
I believed him.

01:40:16.725 --> 01:40:18.852
But I shouldn't have. I-

01:40:18.977 --> 01:40:22.231
I was more interested
in writing what I wanted the story to be...

01:40:22.272 --> 01:40:24.358
than what it actually was.

01:40:24.441 --> 01:40:26.401
You know? The truth.

01:40:28.445 --> 01:40:31.740
I burned you, buddy. I'm sorry.

01:40:31.782 --> 01:40:34.076
It's okay.

01:40:37.579 --> 01:40:40.833
Not about all this...

01:40:40.916 --> 01:40:45.003
but, in general...

01:40:45.087 --> 01:40:47.047
are you pretty proud of me?

01:40:47.131 --> 01:40:49.341
Real proud.

01:40:51.301 --> 01:40:53.262
And would you be proud of me...

01:40:53.303 --> 01:40:56.807
even if I didn't have, like,
a lot of celebrity friends and stuff?

01:40:56.890 --> 01:40:59.101
Like, if I wasn't a big shot?

01:40:59.184 --> 01:41:03.188
Well, not as much, but pretty close.

01:41:10.028 --> 01:41:13.782
Teddy, I told you a lot of things
that weren't true.

01:41:13.866 --> 01:41:16.118
Like being friends
with John Elway and stuff?

01:41:18.704 --> 01:41:20.622
Yeah.

01:41:20.706 --> 01:41:23.459
What about playing golf
with Muhammad Ali?

01:41:27.796 --> 01:41:30.883
I covered a celebrity golf tournament,
and he was playing in it.

01:41:30.966 --> 01:41:35.220
But, Dad, I told everybody
you were friends with John Elway.

01:41:35.304 --> 01:41:37.264
Does that mean I'm a liar too?

01:41:39.516 --> 01:41:41.477
No, it doesn't.

01:41:41.518 --> 01:41:44.188
It means that you trusted me...

01:41:44.271 --> 01:41:46.773
and you told everybody
what I told you.

01:41:48.984 --> 01:41:51.320
And you should be able
to trust your dad.

01:41:59.828 --> 01:42:01.747
So I'm sorry.

01:42:02.915 --> 01:42:06.335
I think I should go to sleep now.

01:42:06.418 --> 01:42:08.086
Hey.

01:42:09.755 --> 01:42:12.800
Come here. Give me a hug.

01:42:17.387 --> 01:42:19.348
You're such a good kid.

01:42:33.529 --> 01:42:36.365
<i>Hey, Champ, that you?</i>

01:42:39.868 --> 01:42:42.204
Mr. Marciano?

01:42:42.287 --> 01:42:44.540
It's Rocky to you, Champ.

01:42:46.667 --> 01:42:49.753
Holy smoke!
What the hell you doin' here?

01:42:49.837 --> 01:42:51.713
I'm lookin' for you.

01:42:53.132 --> 01:42:55.050
<i>- Lookin' for me?
- Yeah.</i>

01:42:55.134 --> 01:42:58.679
- What for?
- I heard you're still workin' out.

01:42:58.762 --> 01:43:02.975
<i>- You're still strong.
- Oh, no, no. I'm old now.</i>

01:43:03.058 --> 01:43:05.519
<i>Ah! Champ, you don't look old.</i>

01:43:05.602 --> 01:43:07.813
I'm makin' a comeback.

01:43:07.896 --> 01:43:10.649
<i>Rocky Marciano, back in the ring.</i>

01:43:10.732 --> 01:43:13.402
I'm lookin' for somebody to spar with.

01:43:14.778 --> 01:43:16.989
Be an honor for me
to spar with you, Rock.

01:43:17.072 --> 01:43:19.158
Good. Let's get started then.

01:43:19.241 --> 01:43:22.911
<i>- Let's see if you got some of the old moves.
- Mm.</i>

01:43:22.995 --> 01:43:25.414
- Come on, Champ.
- I still got some.

01:43:25.497 --> 01:43:28.041
I still got a few.

01:43:28.125 --> 01:43:30.085
<i>Well, let's see 'em then.</i>

01:43:32.421 --> 01:43:34.381
All right. Let's see.

01:43:37.843 --> 01:43:41.138
Oh, lookin' good, Champ.

01:43:48.353 --> 01:43:51.106
<i>Come on, Champ.</i>

01:43:53.692 --> 01:43:56.111
<i>I don't need my friends now.</i>

01:44:02.159 --> 01:44:04.119
I'm not Bob Satterfield.

01:44:04.161 --> 01:44:06.538
- Let's see what you got, Champ!
- I don't want to fight! I ain't Satterfield no more!

01:44:08.749 --> 01:44:10.876
Okay. All right, all right.
You the champ.

01:44:10.959 --> 01:44:12.669
You the champ. You the champ-

01:44:15.130 --> 01:44:18.383
<i>Get up, Champ!
It's just you and me now!</i>

01:44:21.470 --> 01:44:24.306
All right.

01:44:24.348 --> 01:44:26.350
<i>All right.</i>

01:44:33.774 --> 01:44:35.567
I'm gonna kick your ass!

01:45:06.014 --> 01:45:08.267
Tommy Kincaid...

01:45:08.350 --> 01:45:10.435
California Golden Gloves Champion!

01:45:22.030 --> 01:45:25.617
Oh- Oh, God! Oh, God!

01:45:25.701 --> 01:45:28.871
Oh, God!

01:45:28.912 --> 01:45:31.707
Oh, God!

01:45:52.436 --> 01:45:56.148
<i>A writer, like a boxer...</i>

01:45:56.231 --> 01:45:59.193
<i>must stand alone.</i>

01:45:59.276 --> 01:46:02.654
<i>Having your words published,
like entering a ring...</i>

01:46:02.738 --> 01:46:05.199
<i>puts your talent on display.</i>

01:46:05.282 --> 01:46:07.367
<i>And there's nowhere to hide.</i>

01:46:10.078 --> 01:46:15.042
<i>I never intended to write a story
about myself... or my son. Or about love.</i>

01:46:15.125 --> 01:46:19.087
<i>- Or the lies that can sometimes come from love.
- We live in thy fear-</i>

01:46:19.171 --> 01:46:22.341
<i>I will tell you this
about the man I called Champ...</i>

01:46:22.424 --> 01:46:25.177
<i>whom everybody called Champ.</i>

01:46:25.260 --> 01:46:29.097
<i>He was, against all reason, my friend.</i>

01:46:31.141 --> 01:46:32.851
<i>And he was also a liar.</i>

01:46:34.603 --> 01:46:37.272
<i>But was that because
he was trying to make himself...</i>

01:46:37.356 --> 01:46:39.608
<i>better than who he was?</i>

01:46:39.650 --> 01:46:42.152
<i>Or was it because
the one force more powerful...</i>

01:46:42.236 --> 01:46:45.197
<i>than a son wanting
the admiration of his father...</i>

01:46:45.280 --> 01:46:48.116
<i>is the father wanting
the admiration of his son?</i>

01:46:50.035 --> 01:46:53.038
<i>Sometimes we need the help
of our imagination to achieve that status.</i>

01:46:53.121 --> 01:46:57.501
<i>For it is no easy task
being the strongest, wisest...</i>

01:46:57.584 --> 01:47:01.130
<i>- most beloved man in all the land.
- And wow!</i>

01:47:01.213 --> 01:47:03.549
<i>- Tonight, the Raging Bull-
- And what is sadder...</i>

01:47:03.632 --> 01:47:05.676
<i>than that moment
when our children discover...</i>

01:47:05.759 --> 01:47:08.470
<i>that we are not the illusory
supermen we've created...</i>

01:47:08.512 --> 01:47:14.059
<i>but rather, as Herman Melville
once wrote, "men drained of valor'"?</i>

01:47:17.312 --> 01:47:20.816
...is there more news of Tommy Kincaid.

01:47:20.899 --> 01:47:21.900
Erik.

01:47:24.987 --> 01:47:27.322
<i>The lies
that come from love can devastate...</i>

01:47:27.406 --> 01:47:29.825
<i>as much as those
that come from malice.</i>

01:47:35.164 --> 01:47:37.666
<i>- What do you think about guys like-
- Champ's legacy, I suppose...</i>

01:47:37.749 --> 01:47:39.751
<i>is the inspiration for truth.</i>

01:47:39.835 --> 01:47:43.380
<i>And the beauty that can emerge from it.</i>

01:47:43.464 --> 01:47:45.841
I'll tell you how to make
real strong muscles.

01:47:45.924 --> 01:47:48.760
You get your thumb,
you roll up your sleeves...

01:47:48.844 --> 01:47:50.929
and you blow.

01:47:51.013 --> 01:47:54.766
<i>A beauty that lets
our children admire us unconditionally.</i>

01:47:54.850 --> 01:47:57.060
<i>- In fact, he may have-
- Love us unconditionally...</i>

01:47:59.188 --> 01:48:01.315
<i>as I love my son-</i>

01:48:02.316 --> 01:48:04.234
- mucho grande.
- But...

01:48:06.236 --> 01:48:08.155
he had a pure heart.

01:48:10.157 --> 01:48:15.787
