00:16.680 --> 00:23.521
When I was a kid back in Minnesota, I had a Cub Scout den mother, a Mrs. Fryfogel.

00:23.521 --> 00:32.109
She taught us backwoods common sense like "Don't drop crumbs on the trail..."

00:39.516 --> 00:45.336
"...cause you never know what kind of critter might be right behind you picking up the pieces."

00:45.336 --> 00:51.489
I'll never forget the motto she taught us..."Be prepared."

00:54.901 --> 01:01.833
Now it's been said that the best company you could have in a strange place is a map.

01:01.833 --> 01:07.080
This particular map documents the plans of some heavy-handed troublemakers.

01:07.080 --> 01:12.924
Folks back home figure if I can get ahold of it, the trouble might stop.

01:39.444 --> 01:42.809
Look at that man up there!

01:42.809 --> 01:49.321
Halt!  Halt! Stop him!

01:59.406 --> 02:06.889
Great thing about a map is it can get you in and out of places a lot of different ways.

03:42.974 --> 03:47.845
Halt! That is far enough!

03:54.019 --> 03:55.991
The map!

03:56.868 --> 04:03.410
I'd like to, but, uh, I really need it myself.

04:03.948 --> 04:06.245
You amuse me.  Uh!

04:09.332 --> 04:13.925
Sorry.  I really do need it.

06:46.625 --> 06:54.546
It just goes to show ya, a good map will always get you where you wanna go.

07:49.045 --> 07:51.225
Hello?

08:07.957 --> 08:20.441
Hello? Ola! 
Hi. Hi. Name's MacGyver.

08:20.441 --> 08:23.805
I'm lookin' for a photographer by the name of Kate Connolly?

08:23.805 --> 08:27.623
Her publisher said I might find her here.

08:28.517 --> 08:30.909
Look, if I've come at an inconvenient time...

08:30.909 --> 08:33.730
Who is this publisher?

08:33.730 --> 08:40.547
Arthur Prescott. He hasn't heard from Miss Connolly in quite some time, and seein' how things are around here, he got worried enough to...

08:40.547 --> 08:44.236
To send you down here? Hmm?
I'm supposed to believe that?

08:44.236 --> 08:47.855
Oh, hell, Diego, he's probably telling the truth.

08:47.855 --> 08:53.578
I'm almost out of the soup.
Okay, you, come on in.

08:53.578 --> 08:56.891
Senor, I am a terrible shot.

08:56.891 --> 09:03.802
I might try to just wound you a little bit, so you be very careful.

09:03.802 --> 09:06.656
I'm harmless.

09:13.251 --> 09:15.231
Hi.

09:15.231 --> 09:19.224
So, your name's MacGyver and you're harmless.  What do you want?

09:19.224 --> 09:22.122
Well, actually, it's what your publisher wants.

09:22.122 --> 09:25.084
He wants you back home...safe and sound.

09:25.084 --> 09:26.828
So he sent you?

09:26.828 --> 09:29.718
Well, none of his letters or phone calls worked.

09:29.718 --> 09:33.097
You gotta admit I'm a little better than a telegram.

09:33.097 --> 09:36.419
That's Dave Ryerson!

09:36.419 --> 09:39.573
He's not even supposed to be in this hemisphere unless he's in jail.

09:39.573 --> 09:41.781
How do you know him?

09:41.781 --> 09:46.123
Oh, we met...once before he was deported from the States.

09:46.123 --> 09:47.998
Yeah?

09:47.998 --> 09:51.948
Oh, and Dave kind of blames me for that.

09:53.152 --> 09:56.752
You may come in handy.

09:56.752 --> 09:59.813
To your publisher handy means gettin' you outta here.

09:59.813 --> 10:03.094
Huh-uh. I've got a big story cooking.

10:03.094 --> 10:06.567
We've been digging for weeks, and I'm almost there.

10:06.567 --> 10:11.875
Kate, your story could also help us get rid of a piece of human garbage from our government.

10:11.875 --> 10:13.663
General Antonio Vasquez.

10:13.663 --> 10:17.181
Oh yeah, the army guy who runs the secret police.

10:17.181 --> 10:19.846
I understand he has some big career moves in mind, too.

10:19.846 --> 10:25.047
He's got the men. He just needs the arms. And he's dealing for them. Now!

10:25.047 --> 10:27.868
With Ryerson and the crime syndicate?

10:27.868 --> 10:33.809
The deal's set for today and if...when I get the pictures...

10:33.809 --> 10:36.696
Look, I need the pictures.

10:36.696 --> 10:40.031
So your job is to help me get into Ryerson's hacienda.

10:40.031 --> 10:43.484
Oh, excuse me, Ma'am, but my job is to get you out of the country.

10:43.484 --> 10:46.356
MacGyver, you can do both.

10:46.356 --> 10:50.090
We would be most grateful if you could help us.

10:56.793 --> 11:00.711
Then we leave the country?

11:04.696 --> 11:10.537
Senor? You're going to need this.

11:10.537 --> 11:14.278
Actually, I do much better without them. Thanks.

11:15.711 --> 11:17.975
Mind if I borrow something from your camera bag?

11:17.975 --> 11:19.139
It depends what.

11:19.139 --> 11:22.055
Just that camera strap. I need one with a plastic clip.

11:22.055 --> 11:26.967
That wire's got enough juice in it to straighten your hair.

12:07.158 --> 12:10.889
You'd be handy next time I lose my door key.

12:11.179 --> 12:14.633
- You know, this place is none too...
- This spot's just fine.

12:14.633 --> 12:16.287
It's not the safest.

12:16.287 --> 12:20.326
Look, if you're nervous, why don't you wait on the other side of the wall while I take...

12:20.326 --> 12:25.641
Hold it! Hold it! There's Ryerson.

12:39.062 --> 12:43.948
Here comes Vasquez.
The deal's goin' down now.

13:01.354 --> 13:04.594
Compadre!

13:04.594 --> 13:06.557
Great to see you.

13:06.557 --> 13:09.191
Yes, yes, well, good! Looks like you put on some weight, though.

13:09.191 --> 13:13.688
- Right on time. On time. Yep, yep.
- I can't wait. I can't wait.

13:13.688 --> 13:16.780
I understand you have some excellent things for me, huh?

13:16.780 --> 13:18.859
Right...all right now. Here we are.

13:18.859 --> 13:20.903
Plenty more where this came from. What do you think?

13:29.237 --> 13:31.846
Looks like an army surplus store in there.

13:31.846 --> 13:37.668
Oh, perfect! Ryerson is showing the General his sample case.

13:37.668 --> 13:44.042
I can assure you my organization can guarantee delivery of all the light weapons in thirty days, General.

13:44.042 --> 13:45.359
Mmm-hmm.

13:45.359 --> 13:46.975
That's everything you needed, isn't it?

13:46.975 --> 13:51.136
And the tanks?

13:51.136 --> 13:54.953
Three months.

13:54.953 --> 14:02.514
We're ready to start unlimited shipments to you. Is it a deal?

14:02.514 --> 14:07.701
A very complex deal. Very risky for both our futures.

14:07.701 --> 14:09.506
Out of film.

14:10.158 --> 14:12.855
Good. It's time to get outta here.

14:12.855 --> 14:16.642
I need one more shot...the handshake.

14:16.642 --> 14:22.610
But...yes, it is a deal.

14:39.585 --> 14:43.301
I'm an accredited correspondent, and you have no right to do this.

14:43.301 --> 14:53.453
I haven't had the pleasure of meeting the lady before, General, but I'd like to introduce you to an old buddy of mine I've been hopin' to run across again.

14:53.453 --> 14:58.148
Welcome to our country, MacGyver.

15:04.067 --> 15:07.270
Look, I'm warning you. My newspaper knows where I am.

15:07.270 --> 15:10.866
Yeah, so they sent Mother MacGyver here to get you out.

15:10.866 --> 15:12.958
That is why you're here, isn't it, MacGyver?

15:12.958 --> 15:17.761
Well, now, Dave, it just might be that I'm workin' on gettin' kicked out of this country, too.

15:17.761 --> 15:20.513
You know, I'm gonna enjoy your funeral.

15:20.513 --> 15:23.560
Down here they make quite a fiesta out of things like that.

15:23.560 --> 15:28.133
Lots of tequila, some dancing girls...may even shed a tear or two.

15:28.133 --> 15:30.477
You have both won an invitation.

15:30.477 --> 15:34.544
Don't you realize the chance you'd take harming us? My newspaper would...

15:34.544 --> 15:37.789
...write a touching obituary.

15:37.789 --> 15:39.537
Now I'll have the film that you shot.

15:39.537 --> 15:40.754
- No.
- Come on!

15:40.754 --> 15:44.389
Now let's not be dumb about this. What do you say?

15:44.389 --> 15:47.777
Getting sensible, MacGyver? Good.

15:49.824 --> 15:51.153
Here you go, Dave. I think it's that one.

15:51.153 --> 15:53.186
You can't!

16:08.320 --> 16:14.185
You know, Ryerson, now that the evidence is gone, there's probably no need to kill us.

16:14.185 --> 16:15.988
There's no need at all, is there, General?

16:15.988 --> 16:18.908
Probably wouldn't mind if we just kinda mosey on...

16:18.908 --> 16:21.550
I want my cameras back.

16:21.550 --> 16:26.219
Just give me the rest of the film and your other camera, too. Come on!

16:26.219 --> 16:30.293
Uh, yeah, I think a little cooperation would go a long way in this situation, don't you?

16:30.293 --> 16:31.688
Hey, what...

16:35.593 --> 16:36.374
What is that stuff?

16:36.374 --> 17:06.500
Plastique. Silly putty with a bang.

17:06.500 --> 17:08.541
Yeah!

17:10.085 --> 17:11.547
Those photographs!

17:11.547 --> 17:12.976
They'll never be published.

17:12.976 --> 17:15.010
Better not, my friend, or we're both dead.

17:15.010 --> 17:17.125
The enemy's out there.

17:17.125 --> 17:18.880
But you have brought them to me!

17:18.880 --> 17:20.281
All right, so it went haywire.

17:20.281 --> 17:21.803
I was afraid something would go wrong.

17:21.803 --> 17:27.643
It can be fixed! With a little help from your army. Hmm?

17:39.527 --> 17:41.214
I can do the developing in the darkroom.

17:41.214 --> 17:43.483
Wait a minute. Hold it. Hold it.

18:21.879 --> 18:25.216
He really meant it, you know.

18:25.216 --> 18:29.904
Being...the Voice of Truth.

18:30.895 --> 18:32.194
It was because of me that he...

18:32.194 --> 18:38.658
No, it was because of the kind of man he was, Kate.

18:39.446 --> 18:43.583
We'll get that film out. I promise you.

18:43.583 --> 18:54.196
MacGyver, every time something happens around here, they lock the airport down, troops pour all over every friendly embassy, roads are blocked.

18:54.196 --> 18:59.244
Just look, this whole town's already under military guard.

18:59.244 --> 19:04.823
Yep, that's right. So we take film out ourselves.

19:04.823 --> 19:07.093
Across the border into Mexico.

19:07.093 --> 19:08.960
That's more than a hundred kilometers!

19:08.960 --> 19:11.442
How are we even gonna get outta here?

19:11.442 --> 19:14.365
I've been thinkin' about that. 
Do you mind if I borrow something?

19:14.365 --> 19:15.272
What?

19:15.272 --> 19:17.884
Oh, you don't need a bag for just one camera, do you?

19:17.884 --> 19:23.915
I can put this strap to good use. I'll be back.

21:17.309 --> 21:20.301
We need all the help we can get.

21:33.038 --> 21:35.048
Be ready when I get back.

21:35.048 --> 21:38.752
Ready for what? Back from where?

22:29.015 --> 22:30.366
We're outta here!

22:30.366 --> 22:34.626
Are you crazy? They'll hear us.

22:50.165 --> 22:52.282
Oh, that's not necessary.

23:22.572 --> 23:23.920
What are you doing?

23:23.920 --> 23:27.732
I'm makin' a periscope.

23:29.585 --> 23:34.826
Compact!

24:27.380 --> 24:29.302
MacGyver!

24:32.903 --> 24:40.287
Who is this friend of yours?
This MacGyver?

24:44.089 --> 24:46.538
That was terrific!  We made it.

24:46.538 --> 24:50.012
Yeah, but the border's still a hundred kilometers.

24:50.012 --> 24:55.008
And I know Ryerson.
He won't give up easy.

25:09.782 --> 25:15.040
Hey, MacGyver, level with me.
Are we gonna make it?

25:15.040 --> 25:17.703
Well, we made it this far, didn't we?

25:17.703 --> 25:21.918
Somehow I'm not reassured.

25:25.737 --> 25:27.570
We'll stay on the main highway.

25:27.570 --> 25:29.748
You work a search pattern heading north.

25:29.748 --> 25:33.908
Check every road...every mule path.

25:35.966 --> 25:41.541
You know, when I woke up this morning I had three very expensive cameras.

25:41.541 --> 25:46.333
Well, at least you didn't wreck this one. This is my lucky camera.

25:46.333 --> 25:53.746
If anything happened to this baby, I'd die...or kill.

25:59.145 --> 26:01.215
So where're you from, MacGyver?

26:01.215 --> 26:03.306
Well, I started out in Minnesota.

26:03.306 --> 26:08.481
Since then, ah, here, there, this place, that place.

26:08.481 --> 26:10.831
Trouble with the law or itchy feet?

26:10.831 --> 26:12.659
Oh, a little of that.

26:12.659 --> 26:20.639
Mostly I wanted to see how the world worked, meet people, learn how they're different, the same...

26:20.639 --> 26:23.787
MacGyver, you are a romantic!

26:23.787 --> 26:33.985
No, no, just a guy who...Spotter plane! Great!

26:35.710 --> 26:37.887
They're spotted headed north toward Garabuan.

26:37.887 --> 26:40.850
Moving under cover. Lost visual contact.

26:40.850 --> 26:42.879
Faster!

26:46.719 --> 26:50.375
Hang on! The plane saw us!

26:50.375 --> 26:54.739
Slow down, MacGyver, you're messin' up my shots!

27:25.128 --> 27:26.539
Oh...

27:26.539 --> 27:28.401
Don't say it.

27:28.401 --> 27:30.327
I wasn't gonna say a thing.

27:30.327 --> 27:36.303
We're sunk. This is it.
There's no way we're gonna make it.

27:36.303 --> 27:38.568
Ah, it's not that bad.

27:38.568 --> 27:39.729
Oh, yes, it is.

27:39.729 --> 27:41.248
No, it's not.

27:41.248 --> 27:46.003
Please tell me how things could be worse.

27:48.551 --> 27:54.547
Ah, you're right. You convinced me.
We're in a lotta trouble.

27:59.574 --> 28:01.521
So how far are we from the border?

28:01.521 --> 28:04.823
Oh, about ten miles.

28:10.883 --> 28:13.071
So how're you gonna start a fire?

28:13.071 --> 28:15.494
Make lightning or rub two sticks together?

28:15.494 --> 28:18.917
No, thought I'd use a match.

28:18.917 --> 28:25.057
Ah, shucks, MacGyver, I was lookin' forward to seein' some more of your Boy Scout stuff.

28:27.090 --> 28:29.308
What was that?

28:29.308 --> 28:34.024
Sounds like supper to me. Excuse me.

28:39.496 --> 28:41.617
Well, trap worked.

28:41.617 --> 28:43.266
Ooh, what's that?

28:43.266 --> 28:46.375
I told you. Supper.

28:46.375 --> 28:50.616
MacGyver, you don't eat things like that. You call pest control.

28:50.616 --> 28:52.836
No, they taste an awful lot like chicken.

28:52.836 --> 29:00.508
I don't care if they taste like Beluga caviar, I am not eating lizard. Ooh!

29:05.311 --> 29:12.790
Mmm, mmm, very next dinner party I give, breast of lizard a la MacGyver.

29:12.790 --> 29:15.000
Delicious.

29:21.998 --> 29:27.519
You're a very...unexpected man, MacGyver.

29:27.519 --> 29:32.912
You keep me off balance.

29:33.786 --> 29:35.475
Sorry.

29:35.475 --> 29:44.352
No. I think...I think I like it.

30:05.177 --> 30:08.041
Want to share?

30:13.262 --> 30:16.342
That's quite an offer.

30:19.570 --> 30:24.500
Is that a yes or a no?

31:09.867 --> 31:13.468
He's not inside, Commandante!

31:14.944 --> 31:16.770
They're not inside.

31:16.770 --> 31:20.661
Then they're on foot. Good.

31:21.493 --> 31:25.839
Every time something else goes wrong, you say it is 'good'.

31:25.839 --> 31:28.621
If your soldiers had been on the ball back there at the plaza, they...

31:28.621 --> 31:31.771
You are talking to a general!

31:31.771 --> 31:35.099
Oh, I thought I was talking to my new partner.

31:35.099 --> 31:39.126
But the border is less than ten miles to the north!

31:39.126 --> 31:44.862
Look, General, why don't you try keeping half of your troops back here behind them...

31:44.862 --> 31:47.447
pushing them forward so they can't double back.

31:47.447 --> 31:50.605
There's only one road leading to the border...and we control it.

31:50.605 --> 31:55.163
So they want to cross the border, they have to come through here through us.

31:55.163 --> 31:57.504
So it's just a matter of time.

31:57.504 --> 32:01.494
That's what you told me fifty kilometers ago, Ryerson.

32:01.494 --> 32:09.556
But...if your plan fails and they get through, I will not deport you.

32:09.556 --> 32:13.417
I will destroy you.

32:13.417 --> 32:18.117
Even if it's my last act in in office.

32:25.786 --> 32:27.086
What do you see?

32:27.086 --> 32:29.370
Two men with guns. What do you see?

32:29.370 --> 32:31.714
Opportunity knocking.

32:31.714 --> 32:34.947
You know, you could stand to lose a few pounds.

32:34.947 --> 32:36.316
Rat!

32:36.316 --> 32:42.693
Buenos dias, you guys!
Shake. Name's MacGyver.

32:42.693 --> 32:44.903
We're the ones you're lookin' for.

32:44.903 --> 32:49.205
And, fellas, this here's your lucky day!

32:49.205 --> 32:51.635
You get to turn us in.

32:51.635 --> 32:54.993
Listen, would you mind holdin' her? She weighs a ton.

33:05.743 --> 33:11.089
All right, Connolly! Yes, yes! 
Now you're gettin' the hang of things.

33:11.089 --> 33:15.575
My lucky camera...it's wrecked!

33:15.575 --> 33:21.784
Well, now I betcha we can get it fixed about nine miles up that road.

33:26.767 --> 33:29.790
I'm sorry.

33:34.498 --> 33:38.135
Any time, MacGyver.

33:38.467 --> 33:42.291
I like that kind of talk.

33:59.333 --> 34:00.545
See anything?

34:00.545 --> 34:03.704
No. It's like we're the only people in the whole world.

34:03.704 --> 34:05.681
Oh, I wouldn't count on it.

34:05.681 --> 34:08.456
My guess is they're not more than an hour behind us.

34:08.456 --> 34:11.617
We must be damned close to that border.

34:23.938 --> 34:27.626
MacGyver, we are just about there!

34:31.005 --> 34:39.781
We are there, Kate. That's Mexico, right there, the other side of that river.

35:12.708 --> 35:14.986
What do you think?

35:14.986 --> 35:18.175
Oh, I gotta admit these two boys know what they're doin'.

35:18.175 --> 35:26.208
They got every approach to the border locked up tight.There's just no goin' around 'em.

35:26.754 --> 35:31.502
Well, I guess we're just gonna have to go through 'em. Attack.

35:31.502 --> 35:34.129
With what?

35:34.129 --> 35:38.847
That's a good question. Yeah. Yeah.

35:43.014 --> 35:45.992
Nothing he can do. Nothing.

35:48.679 --> 35:50.656
Mexican Border Patrol.

35:50.656 --> 35:54.312
Let 'em watch. They can keep score.

36:17.362 --> 36:20.438
It's not great. It's not bad.

36:20.438 --> 36:22.966
What're we gonna do, MacGyver?

36:23.644 --> 36:25.977
Start a war, I guess.

36:25.977 --> 36:28.723
You make it sound so easy.

36:28.723 --> 36:33.172
Just to keep me from thinking about how scared I am.

36:35.672 --> 36:39.507
...continue the search, Commandante! No signs of intruders.

36:39.507 --> 36:41.124
Keep searching.

36:41.124 --> 36:44.720
They gotta be up there. They gotta be!

36:44.720 --> 36:48.565
Airplane reports nothing.

36:52.518 --> 36:56.505
First time I ever deliberately tried to overheat an engine.

36:56.505 --> 37:01.907
Okay, we now have a lot of dirty oil. What's that do for the war effort?

37:01.907 --> 37:07.772
The military calls it chemical fog. 
Civilians get more to the point. It's air pollution.

37:07.772 --> 37:12.075
What does the, uh, MacGyver/Connolly team call it?

37:12.075 --> 37:13.343
A long shot.

37:13.343 --> 37:15.699
Running low on fuel.
Returning to base.

37:15.699 --> 37:20.325
I don't care if you're low on fuel.
Keep looking.

37:21.054 --> 37:22.946
Here.

37:26.965 --> 37:32.147
When this heats up, it oughta make some pretty good lookin' smog.

37:36.383 --> 37:38.836
Where are they?

37:39.328 --> 37:41.408
They can't just disappear like shadows.

37:41.408 --> 37:44.391
Look, General, your troops are here.
And behind 'em.

37:44.391 --> 37:50.217
Every exit sealed off. You've done a good job. Don't panic.

37:50.217 --> 37:53.719
So you feel we have them...caught between us?

37:53.719 --> 38:00.711
I know it. Either they come out our way or they don't come out at all.

38:03.092 --> 38:09.738
Smoke bombs, stink bombs, rolling bombs, juggarnauts...I feel like Rosie the Riveter in a jury-rigged bomb factory.

38:09.738 --> 38:13.702
Quite an inventory. But not much to be proud of though.

38:13.702 --> 38:18.042
Hey, it has my approval. How're we gonna get this darned thing across the river?

38:18.042 --> 38:22.697
Under their noses.

38:59.217 --> 39:00.843
Spotter G - to command post.

39:00.843 --> 39:04.459
Subjects are in Section five and headed toward the border.

39:05.544 --> 39:07.458
General, we got 'em!

39:07.458 --> 39:09.206
Bueno!

39:35.666 --> 39:36.873
They're crazy!

39:39.108 --> 39:40.790
And smart.

40:08.251 --> 40:10.935
Go into the mountains!

40:19.512 --> 40:22.557
It's time to get our party started.

41:24.777 --> 41:27.387
All right!

41:28.345 --> 41:31.557
Watch for them, now. Watch for them!

41:31.557 --> 41:34.234
Shoot anything that moves!

41:35.568 --> 41:37.428
Okay, you ready?

41:37.428 --> 41:41.169
If, uh, things don't work out...

41:42.741 --> 41:45.897
I'm really glad I got to know you.

41:45.897 --> 41:47.832
Me, too.

41:52.481 --> 41:55.262
Let's go!

42:01.378 --> 42:05.491
Forward! Up the hill!

42:41.778 --> 42:45.876
- Look out, Connolly!
- Look out to what?

43:03.950 --> 43:06.839
Come on, Kate. Swim!

43:14.784 --> 43:17.885
- There they are! Kill them!
- Guards, shoot them!

43:17.885 --> 43:23.504
- MacGyver!
- Shoot them!

43:46.441 --> 43:51.988
Welcome to Mexico.
Do you have anything to declare?

43:53.008 --> 43:56.020
Wise guy.

44:05.351 --> 44:13.103
Well, David, it's too late.

44:13.712 --> 44:19.891
I always keep my promises.

44:42.346 --> 44:43.788
I thought your camera was broken.

44:43.788 --> 44:48.379
I fixed it...MacGyver style.
