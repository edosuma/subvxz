00:03.500 --> 00:04.899
Spencer, I'm your mother.

00:04.900 --> 00:06.060
Your father will be home soon.

00:06.070 --> 00:07.731
There was a problem
with the passport.

00:07.740 --> 00:09.594
How long is he gonna put off
coming home to face me?

00:10.710 --> 00:12.803
- Will you marry me?
- I need a minute.

'Jessica had a file
on each of us.‘

00:14.810 --> 00:17.335
Yeah, all of us except Aria.
She doesn't have a ﬁle.

00:17.350 --> 00:20.308
I didn't finish my turn,
so I was sent this.

00:21.780 --> 00:23.179
Compliments of Jenna Marshall.

00:23.190 --> 00:24.339
We're gonna take
a nice little drive

00:24.350 --> 00:25.817
to go visit your friend, Jenna.

00:25.820 --> 00:27.640
And on the way there,
you're gonna tell us about

00:27.660 --> 00:29.878
how the two of you know someone
with the initials A.D.

00:29.890 --> 00:32.279
(Aria)
'GPS tracker's in her bag.
Sydney's on the move.‘

00:32.290 --> 00:33.757
I'll take ﬁrst watch
and follow her tonight.

00:34.700 --> 00:36.554
Have someone call Forensics.

00:36.570 --> 00:37.628
Give me an evidence bag.

Driftin' away..

00:57.720 --> 00:59.449
Hey.

00:59.460 --> 01:01.280
A vision so darkened..

01:01.290 --> 01:03.110
Nicole's upstairs.
She's sleeping.

01:03.130 --> 01:05.587
I cannot stay..

01:05.590 --> 01:06.420
I'm so sorry

01:08.030 --> 01:10.999
'Someone saw her getting into a
cab outside the trauma clinic.'

01:11.000 --> 01:12.365
Her therapist, her parents

01:12.370 --> 01:14.326
we've all been looking
for her for hours.

01:14.340 --> 01:16.137
She didn't tell you
that she was coming here?

01:16.140 --> 01:18.335
No, she didn't, so..

01:18.340 --> 01:20.365
Thank you for texting me,
letting me know.

01:20.980 --> 01:23.175
Ezra, of course.

01:23.180 --> 01:25.239
I will take her back
to the clinic

01:25.250 --> 01:26.501
first thing tomorrow.

01:26.980 --> 01:28.516
Okay.

01:28.520 --> 01:30.818
Carry me close
like the tear drops..

01:30.820 --> 01:33.186
Hey, you don't have to go.

01:33.190 --> 01:34.589
I'm not taking the sofa.

01:37.030 --> 01:38.588
Nicole's already asleep
upstairs.

01:39.100 --> 01:40.658
I'm so sorry.

01:40.660 --> 01:45.063
- I, I know how difficult--
- Ezra, I'm fine.

01:45.070 --> 01:46.867
But when I lay my..

01:46.870 --> 01:48.633
I, I..

01:48.640 --> 01:51.165
I'm just tired.

01:51.170 --> 01:53.001
And I thought
that I should stay

01:53.010 --> 01:54.409
until you got back.

01:54.410 --> 01:56.776
I'm really glad you did.

01:56.780 --> 01:58.907
Thank you again.

01:58.910 --> 02:01.242
I don't know
what you've told her about us

02:01.250 --> 02:02.569
or what you haven't told her

02:02.590 --> 02:04.410
but there are pictures of me
all over this place.

02:04.420 --> 02:06.411
My clothes are upstairs
in your closet.

02:06.420 --> 02:08.456

of questions in the morning.

No, I'm okay.

02:21.800 --> 02:23.631
Thank you, really.

02:23.640 --> 02:24.732
You're saving me

02:24.740 --> 02:27.061
from having to face my parents
in the morning.

02:27.080 --> 02:28.934
They still don't really
understand the whole

02:28.940 --> 02:30.168
Nicole situation.

02:30.650 --> 02:31.674
Do you?

02:33.220 --> 02:35.245
Yeah, I understand
why he wants to help her

02:36.220 --> 02:38.188
you know,
especially after seeing her.

02:40.690 --> 02:42.749
Have you eaten?

02:42.760 --> 02:44.318
I'm not hungry.

02:44.330 --> 02:47.185
It's not what I asked.
Come on.

02:48.330 --> 02:50.457
Oh, my God.

02:50.470 --> 02:53.962
- How long has that been here?
- I don't know.

Is there any chance
this thing's broken?

It's not broken.
It's deciding.

Can you keep it?

in your pocket

you won't tell what I said

- I called you last night.

03:51.460 --> 03:54.554
- Oh, I was busy. What's up?
- 'The game board.‘

to move it to my house?

03:59.130 --> 04:00.768
What? You're joking, right?

04:00.770 --> 04:03.034
It took me an hour to get
that monstrosity up to the loft

04:03.040 --> 04:04.701
so that nobody would see and
you're saying that it's gone?

04:04.710 --> 04:07.759
It's not gone, Spencer.
It's on my dining table.

04:07.780 --> 04:09.998
Does that mean
that it's your turn?

04:10.010 --> 04:11.170
It hasn't decided yet.

04:11.180 --> 04:12.909
- Hm.. _
- Are you always up this early?

Hey, good morning.

04:15.780 --> 04:17.771
- 'Who are you talking to?'
- Uh, nobody.

04:17.790 --> 04:19.246
I really have to go, though,
okay?

04:19.260 --> 04:21.683
I'll, I'll call you
right back. Bye.

04:23.890 --> 04:27.348
- Hey, did you sleep okay?
- Mm-hmm.

04:28.260 --> 04:29.989
I'll go make us some coffee.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.628
Or you could get back in bed
just for a little bit.

[cell phone ringing]

04:39.510 --> 04:40.829

Alright, I need to check this.

I'm waiting for an update
on a case.

earlier than I expected.

What case is it?

04:58.530 --> 05:01.055
Sorry, I can't talk about it.

05:01.060 --> 05:03.824
- I'll call you later, okay?
- Yeah, of course.

05:08.940 --> 05:10.464
Yeah, Caleb's doing
much better.

05:10.470 --> 05:12.961
They sent him home last night.

05:12.980 --> 05:14.436
No, Lucas, it's not your fault.

05:14.440 --> 05:16.579
I should have been there.

05:16.580 --> 05:18.571
Well, maybe the investors
will change their mind.

05:19.720 --> 05:21.415
Alright, we'll talk soon.

05:21.420 --> 05:23.274
Ah you think you got me
where you..

05:23.290 --> 05:24.814
- Does this smell?
- What?

05:24.820 --> 05:26.685
One sniff, please?

05:26.690 --> 05:27.941
Supposed to do laundry
last night

05:27.960 --> 05:30.155
but I was out following
Sydney until 4 am.

05:30.160 --> 05:32.321
- You're fine.
- Okay.

05:32.330 --> 05:33.786
Except for that
giant coffee stain.

05:33.800 --> 05:35.392
- How did it even get there?
- Oh.

05:35.400 --> 05:36.856
Well, Clara Mott

05:36.870 --> 05:39.122
tripped in the teacher's lounge
and got it all over me.

05:39.130 --> 05:40.893
Never mind, wear this.

05:40.900 --> 05:44.563
So what happened last night?
Did Sydney lead you to Jenna?

05:44.570 --> 05:47.209
Not unless Jenna lives in
the bathroom of a Greyhound bus.

05:47.210 --> 05:49.132
That's where Sydney left the
tracker that we put in her bag.

05:49.140 --> 05:52.246
And by the time I found it,
we were halfway to Pittsburgh.

05:52.250 --> 05:53.444
A.D.'s still one step ahead

05:53.450 --> 05:56.044
and I am 40 minutes late
to work.

05:56.890 --> 05:58.710
Can I eat this?

06:00.660 --> 06:02.616
- Em.
- No?

06:02.620 --> 06:05.384

I'm the first one who hasn't
completed her turn.

06:06.700 --> 06:09.260
Look, I know you're worried

06:09.260 --> 06:10.693
but maybe
putting Caleb in the hospital

06:10.700 --> 06:12.895
and hurting your business
was your punishment.

06:12.900 --> 06:16.688
Just try not to freak out over
something you can't control.

06:16.710 --> 06:19.304
Waiting around

06:19.310 --> 06:20.902
Someday

06:25.380 --> 06:27.041
Hey, Marie.
Sorry I missed the meeting.

06:27.050 --> 06:28.176
Hey, Sal.

06:28.180 --> 06:29.977
Hey, so sorry I'm late.

06:29.990 --> 06:32.481
- What did I miss?
- Not much.

06:32.490 --> 06:34.412
- Handout?
- Sure.

06:36.230 --> 06:37.811
What are you doin' for lunch?

06:37.830 --> 06:38.922
My treat.

06:38.930 --> 06:41.319
I can't.
I'm having lunch with Hackett.

06:41.330 --> 06:43.992
Oh. Everything okay?

06:44.000 --> 06:45.365
Yeah.

06:45.370 --> 06:47.065
[indistinct announcement on PA]

06:48.370 --> 06:49.928
I heard
from the University of Iowa.

06:49.940 --> 06:52.408
They're offering me
the assistant coaching position.

06:52.410 --> 06:53.866
I thought they offered that
to someone else

06:53.880 --> 06:55.404
and that's why
you took the job here.

06:55.410 --> 06:57.071
I guess
they changed their minds.

06:57.080 --> 06:59.207
Wow! That's..

06:59.210 --> 07:02.543
- You're gonna take it?
- I'd be stupid not to, right?

Good morning.

07:04.550 --> 07:06.415
Hey! You're back.

Yeah, I'm in between classes.

Can we talk?

07:09.590 --> 07:11.524
Yeah, just give me a sec.

07:43.360 --> 07:44.588

be back

07:45.630 --> 07:46.858
until Thursday.

07:46.860 --> 07:48.794

I could have been here sooner'

you've been going through.

07:51.600 --> 07:52.794
You mean getting shot
or finding out

07:52.800 --> 07:54.529
that mom isn't my real mom?

07:56.410 --> 07:58.093
She's your real mom, Spencer.

07:59.240 --> 08:00.901
She raised you.
We both love you.

08:00.910 --> 08:03.401
Just stop.
Stop, okay?

over a week ago

08:06.180 --> 08:07.647
There was no issue
With your passport.

There was
no emergency busmess deal

08:09.320 --> 08:10.969
that you needed to attend to.

08:10.990 --> 08:12.082
So where were you?

08:13.190 --> 08:14.646
Where were you
that was more important

08:14.660 --> 08:16.082
than being here with me?

08:16.090 --> 08:17.785
I was looking for Mary.

08:20.500 --> 08:23.754
I-I wanted to be here,
believe me..

08:23.770 --> 08:26.261
...but after everything I put
you and your mother through

08:26.270 --> 08:29.660
I won't let that woman do _
any more damage to this family.

08:29.670 --> 08:31.763
I know you're confused
and you're hurt.

08:32.770 --> 08:34.761
I still can't explain
what I did

08:34.780 --> 08:36.475
but as big as a mistake
as it was

08:36.480 --> 08:40.143
and, Spencer, it was huge,
I know that.

08:40.150 --> 08:43.608
I don't regret what happened
because we ended up with you.

...find Mary?

08:58.370 --> 09:00.691
No, not yet.

09:00.700 --> 09:02.964
But I'm working with
an investigator, and we will.

09:03.540 --> 09:05.235
And then what?

09:05.240 --> 09:06.537
Are you gonna chase her away

09:06.540 --> 09:08.804
so that I never_
get to see her again?

09:08.810 --> 09:10.698

but you won't have to do it
for much longer.

to terminate the pregnancy.

09:31.400 --> 09:34.062
You sound certain.
That's good.

09:35.170 --> 09:36.660
Archer..

09:36.670 --> 09:38.729
He manipulated me
into loving him

09:38.740 --> 09:40.731
and marrying him.

09:40.740 --> 09:42.708
And when he locked me up
at Welby

09:42.710 --> 09:44.405
he literally took away
my ability

09:44.410 --> 09:46.970
to make decisions on anything.

09:46.980 --> 09:50.108
And this pregnancy, it feels
like he's still in control.

09:52.250 --> 09:54.309
I want my life back, Em.

09:54.320 --> 09:56.618
- You don't have to explain.
- I know.

10:02.500 --> 10:04.024
When's your appointment?

10:04.030 --> 10:06.590
I take the first pill
at the clinic this weekend.

10:06.600 --> 10:09.728
And the next one at home
a few days later.

10:09.740 --> 10:11.139
Can I take you
to the clinic?

10:11.610 --> 10:12.861
Yeah.

10:15.210 --> 10:16.802
[sighs]

10:17.350 --> 10:18.806
[knock on door]

10:27.590 --> 10:28.955
Detective Furey.

10:28.960 --> 10:31.212
Miss DiLaurentis.
Do you have a moment?

10:31.930 --> 10:33.682
Sure.

10:37.470 --> 10:39.097
She said that treatment facility

10:39.100 --> 10:40.795
just felt like another
form of captivity.

10:40.800 --> 10:42.893
So she hailed
a very expenSIve cab

10:42.900 --> 10:45.130
and drove back to the last place
she called home.

10:46.580 --> 10:48.161
Your apartment?

10:49.280 --> 10:52.169
The therapist had asked us
not to tell Nicole

10:52.180 --> 10:53.602
about the engagement.

10:53.620 --> 10:56.714
Yeah, last night it didn't..

10:56.720 --> 10:58.642
...didn't seem like
Nicole knew that much.

10:58.650 --> 11:01.483
Doctor Rosen is just
trying to help her

11:01.490 --> 11:03.481
adjust to all the changes
in her life

11:03.490 --> 11:04.809
as gradually as possible.

11:04.830 --> 11:06.786
But, she knows now.

11:06.800 --> 11:08.279
Everything?

11:08.300 --> 11:11.667
The wedding dress in the closet
was a pretty big giveaway.

11:13.040 --> 11:14.393
But, hey..

11:19.010 --> 11:22.673
Look, we talked for a while.

11:22.680 --> 11:24.932
She says that
she wants me to be happy.

11:27.420 --> 11:28.512
I am sorry.

11:28.520 --> 11:31.512
I have been
such a crappy fiance.

11:31.520 --> 11:33.818
But I,
I hope you realize that

11:33.820 --> 11:37.358
with her being here,
her being alive

11:37.360 --> 11:38.759
it doesn't change a thing

11:38.760 --> 11:40.352
about how I feel about you.

11:41.360 --> 11:42.691
She'll be gone in a few hours

11:42.700 --> 11:44.691
and we can go back to
being us again.

11:44.700 --> 11:46.224
I promise.

11:47.700 --> 11:49.895
- Okay.
- I love you.

11:51.440 --> 11:52.805
I love you, too.

12:01.080 --> 12:03.275
A finger?

12:03.290 --> 12:04.575
Someone sent you a finger.

12:04.590 --> 12:06.945
- Are you sure that it's--
- Archer Dunhill's, yes.

12:06.960 --> 12:08.882
The prints were a match.

12:08.890 --> 12:10.881
Do you have any idea
who sent it or why?

12:10.890 --> 12:13.188
It seems like
some sort of taunt

12:13.200 --> 12:14.326
or a game.

12:17.570 --> 12:19.993
This morning our forensics' team

12:20.000 --> 12:22.389
confirmed that the finger
was detached from tissue

12:22.400 --> 12:24.391
that have been decomposing
for some time.

12:24.410 --> 12:26.731
Possibly around the time
that Archer Dunhill

12:26.740 --> 12:29.072
disappeared in
the first place.

12:29.080 --> 12:31.173
We're now treating this case
as a homicide.

12:34.020 --> 12:36.978
I know that this is difficult..

12:36.990 --> 12:38.582
...but I do hope that
we can count on your help

12:38.590 --> 12:40.148
with this investigation.

12:40.160 --> 12:41.889
Anything that you can tell us
about anyone

12:41.890 --> 12:44.859
that might have had a motive
or held a grudge.

12:44.860 --> 12:46.589
It could help us out
significantly.

12:46.600 --> 12:48.079
He was a con artist

12:48.100 --> 12:50.751
who treated dozens
of mental patients

12:50.770 --> 12:52.795
without any actual
medical training.

12:53.300 --> 12:54.927
Yeah.

12:54.940 --> 12:57.192
I know a few people
who might hold a grudge.

12:57.210 --> 12:58.029
Including you.

12:58.040 --> 13:00.201
I'm not upset
that he's gone

13:00.210 --> 13:01.802
if that's what
you're asking.

13:05.450 --> 13:06.974
What about Mary Drake?

13:08.580 --> 13:10.047
You think she might
be involved?

13:10.050 --> 13:11.677
She's gone into hiding.

13:11.690 --> 13:14.443
And after what you told us
about her connection to Dunhill

13:14.460 --> 13:17.179
she's a person of interest
in this case.

13:17.190 --> 13:19.954
Guess you can't be too sure
about anyone these days.

13:19.960 --> 13:21.518
No you can't.

13:22.930 --> 13:26.127
[intense music]

13:30.340 --> 13:31.659
- This isn't happening.
- Yes, it is.

13:31.670 --> 13:33.433
No, A.D. doesn't get to
poison Caleb

13:33.440 --> 13:36.432
bankrupt Lucas' company,
ruin my reputation

13:36.440 --> 13:38.908
and then expose us for murder
all in one go. No.

13:38.910 --> 13:40.275
- Hanna.
- What?

13:40.280 --> 13:42.271
Where are the rules
for this stupid game anyways?

13:42.280 --> 13:45.044
Every time we fail a turn, the
cops get of a piece of Archer?

13:45.050 --> 13:47.041
'What's next, his knee caps
or his ear lobes?‘

13:47.060 --> 13:48.812
Or the video of you two
digging up the grave.

13:48.820 --> 13:50.356
We already know
that AD. has that.

13:50.360 --> 13:52.089
(Emily)
'Is this punishment
for Charlotte?‘

13:52.090 --> 13:53.751
We didn't find her killer
and now A.D.'s gonna help

13:53.760 --> 13:54.829
the cops find us?

13:54.830 --> 13:57.355
[bell ringing]

13:57.370 --> 13:59.497
[machine whirring]

14:07.510 --> 14:08.636
(Alison)
'My turn.'

14:08.640 --> 14:10.938
Mystery location. Great.

14:14.850 --> 14:17.045
"Solve the puzzle,
get away with murder."

14:19.320 --> 14:21.208
"Or fail
and go directly to jail."

14:23.390 --> 14:25.255
Alright, so we continue
playing the game

14:25.260 --> 14:27.125
or the cops find out
what we did.

14:27.130 --> 14:30.099
- 'Didn't we already know that?‘
- Yeah, but now it's a race.

14:30.100 --> 14:31.863
We have to solve this puzzle
before the cops

14:31.870 --> 14:33.326
can solve Dunhill's murder.

14:33.340 --> 14:35.638
Furey already suspects
that Archer was killed

14:35.640 --> 14:36.789
the night he disappeared.

14:36.810 --> 14:38.038
He's gonna find out
the truth.

14:38.040 --> 14:40.304
No one can screw up
her turn.

14:40.310 --> 14:41.800
Not anymore.

14:41.810 --> 14:44.199
If the cops get one more clue
about what we did..

14:44.880 --> 14:47.075
It's game over.

14:49.380 --> 14:50.210
Uh..

14:50.220 --> 14:52.017
Alright,
so when did you decide

14:52.020 --> 14:53.681
to start sleeping
with the guy

14:53.690 --> 14:54.748
who can one day
arrest us all?

14:54.760 --> 14:56.489
I didn't decide.

14:56.490 --> 15:00.153
I was upset about Toby
and Ivan and Marco came over.

15:00.160 --> 15:01.525
- He's nice.
- No.

15:01.530 --> 15:04.124
I have no issue with his
personality, just his job.

15:04.130 --> 15:05.859
Yeah, well, so do I.

15:05.870 --> 15:07.929
Oh, got it.

15:10.070 --> 15:12.903
How is Toby?
Have you talked to him?

15:12.910 --> 15:14.662
Uh, no, I left him a message

15:14.680 --> 15:15.908
but he hasn't called me back.

15:15.910 --> 15:17.070
Hey, are you ready to go?

15:17.080 --> 15:18.945
I wanna leave before
my dad gets home.

15:20.550 --> 15:22.575
"Private investigator."

15:22.580 --> 15:24.377
Did Marco give you this?

15:24.390 --> 15:27.041
Uh, no, I swiped that
from my dad's briefcase.

15:27.760 --> 15:29.250
He's looking for Mary.

15:29.260 --> 15:31.683
- Did she have any leads?
- I don't know.

15:33.460 --> 15:35.792
- We should find out.
- No, we shouldn't.

15:35.800 --> 15:38.496
Spencer, Mary was in the blind
school when you got shot.

15:38.500 --> 15:39.990
She could have seen
the second shooter

15:40.000 --> 15:42.560
maybe she saw AD.
and that's why she ran away.

15:42.570 --> 15:44.333
Or she ran away because
once she told me

15:44.340 --> 15:45.898
that she was my birth mother,
she realized that it was

15:45.910 --> 15:48.777
a colossal mistake and then she
never wanted to see me again.

15:48.780 --> 15:50.407
No, Spencer, that's crazy.

15:51.280 --> 15:54.169
Well, crazy runs in my family.

15:54.180 --> 15:56.478
Look, I wanna find her,
believe me I do.

15:56.480 --> 15:57.879
I just, I have
so many questions

15:57.890 --> 16:00.108
I wouldn't even know
where to start.

16:00.120 --> 16:01.678
How about why'd you run away?

16:05.790 --> 16:07.451
[dialing keypad]

16:08.030 --> 16:09.895
[phone ringing]

16:09.900 --> 16:11.094
Hi, Miss Harper.

16:11.100 --> 16:14.991
I'm calling
from Mr. Hastings office.

16:18.610 --> 16:20.168
Whoa.

16:21.310 --> 16:23.505
- What happened?
- Um..

16:24.650 --> 16:26.003
Nicole found the book.

16:26.820 --> 16:28.913
And she threw it at you?

16:28.920 --> 16:30.512
No, at her parents..

16:31.420 --> 16:33.285
...when they came to
take her back.

16:37.530 --> 16:40.522
[instrumental music]

16:41.600 --> 16:43.329
Did Nicole write this?

16:47.970 --> 16:50.495
"This memory of us
kept me alive.

16:52.470 --> 16:54.802
"I can't tell you how many
nights I thought about you

16:54.810 --> 16:58.177
"and our love, and I knew
that I had to be strong.

16:58.980 --> 17:00.277
I.."

17:00.280 --> 17:03.477
[music continues]

17:18.630 --> 17:19.790
Great job today, guys.

17:19.800 --> 17:21.290
Get some rest, okay?

17:21.300 --> 17:22.631
See you tomorrow.

17:24.210 --> 17:25.529
[door closing]

17:27.040 --> 17:29.702
- Hey.
- Hey.

17:29.710 --> 17:31.177
You're here late.

17:31.180 --> 17:32.943
I had a call
with the head coach in Iowa.

17:32.950 --> 17:34.474
Thought I'd use my office.

17:34.480 --> 17:36.016
Oh.

17:36.020 --> 17:37.976
Really leaving?

17:37.990 --> 17:40.049
They want a decision
by tomorrow.

17:42.390 --> 17:44.688
When you showed up
here in Rosewood, I..

17:44.690 --> 17:46.783
...really thought we're gonna
get another chance at this.

17:48.030 --> 17:49.691
At us.

17:49.700 --> 17:51.190
So did I.

17:52.530 --> 17:55.738
But coming back here
was a mistake.

17:55.740 --> 17:57.230
Doesn't have to be.

17:59.410 --> 18:02.038
I thought I was over
high school.

18:02.040 --> 18:03.439
But it's really hard
to be over a place

18:03.450 --> 18:04.678
when you're smack dab in it

18:04.680 --> 18:07.148
and it feels like
so much hasn't changed.

18:09.980 --> 18:13.245
You and Allie
are still keeping secrets.

18:13.250 --> 18:15.889
I told you, it's not
what you think it is.

18:15.890 --> 18:17.255
Maybe not.

18:17.260 --> 18:19.683
But when I see you two
whispering in the hallway

18:19.690 --> 18:22.420
it takes me right back
to high school too.

18:22.430 --> 18:25.490
To feeling small and insecure
and paranoid.

18:25.500 --> 18:27.263
And I don't want to
feel those things anymore.

18:27.270 --> 18:30.239
- You don't have to.
- I know I don't.

18:30.240 --> 18:32.265
I can just go
somewhere else.

18:35.110 --> 18:37.169
Goodnight.

18:43.450 --> 18:45.441
(Alison)
'It's latitude and longitude.'

18:45.450 --> 18:47.281
It must lead to
the mystery location.

18:47.290 --> 18:49.212
[cellphone beeping]

18:49.220 --> 18:50.312
When are you going?
I'll come with you.

18:50.330 --> 18:52.013
After school.

18:52.030 --> 18:54.248
[sighs]
Are you okay?

18:54.260 --> 18:55.750
You look a little..

18:55.760 --> 18:59.321
Yeah, my stomach's just been
kind of weird lately.

19:00.140 --> 19:02.131
So where's Ezra now?

19:02.140 --> 19:04.096
[sighs]
He's at home.

19:04.110 --> 19:05.702
He's talking
to Nicole's therapist.

19:05.710 --> 19:07.666
Apparently she had a set back
because of the book.

19:07.680 --> 19:08.977
I just..

19:08.980 --> 19:10.572
...had to get
out of there.

19:10.580 --> 19:12.070
(Alison)
'Well, first of all,
Nicole isn't having'

19:12.080 --> 19:13.604
'a setback because of the book.‘

19:13.620 --> 19:15.201
She's having a setback
'cause she was

19:15.220 --> 19:17.677
held captive in a jungle
for two years.

19:17.690 --> 19:19.840
Yeah, well,
the book didn't help.

19:19.850 --> 19:22.978
And I'm the idiot
who convinced him to write it.

19:22.990 --> 19:24.617

what was in your file'

'he would definitely
choose Nicole.‘

'And she would be

on the street.‘

20:01.330 --> 20:03.628
I know my dad's detective thinks
that Mary's hiding out

20:03.630 --> 20:05.257
somewhere in this neighborhood
but that doesn't mean

20:05.270 --> 20:07.067
you get to terrorize
the residents.

20:07.070 --> 20:08.219
You made that old man cry.

20:08.240 --> 20:09.264
Hey, well that old man
could have been

20:09.270 --> 20:10.931
harboring a dangerous criminal.

20:10.940 --> 20:13.534
Or an innocent women who just
gotten mixed up in something.

20:13.540 --> 20:16.407
Spencer, Mary knows something,
that's why she disappeared.

20:19.110 --> 20:22.443
Okay, I just need to remind you
I'm looking for my birth mother.

20:22.450 --> 20:23.849
Please if I wanted to go
on a witch-hunt

20:23.850 --> 20:25.715
I would have gone
on this trip with my dad.

20:27.190 --> 20:29.886
You're right.
No more pitchforks, I promise.

20:34.400 --> 20:36.595
- Hanna?
- Ted?

20:37.900 --> 20:39.492
What are you doing here?

- You just what?

21:26.610 --> 21:29.113
You're right she looks
just like Alison's mom

21:29.120 --> 21:30.610
but no, I haven't seen her.

21:30.620 --> 21:33.748
Are you sure? Maybe
at a neighbor's house or..

21:33.760 --> 21:35.751
No, sorry.

21:35.760 --> 21:38.251
I guess we wrote down
the wrong address.

21:38.260 --> 21:40.285
I'm glad you did.

21:40.300 --> 21:42.894
I can't tell you
how great it is to see you.

21:42.900 --> 21:44.549
Tell me what you've been up to,
I heard you're in New York

21:44.570 --> 21:47.698
working for some big time
designer and you got engaged?

21:47.700 --> 21:50.066
Well, that didn't really
work out.

21:50.070 --> 21:54.063
Both the engagement
and New York thing.

21:54.080 --> 21:56.571
Well, you'll figure it out,

21:56.580 --> 21:59.902
you're resilient beyond measure,
both of you.

22:01.650 --> 22:05.074
We can sit down a minute,
I could bring out some tea.

22:05.090 --> 22:07.888
Uh, we really can't stay,
I'm so sorry.

22:07.890 --> 22:10.484
Um, do you still have
the same e-mail?

22:10.490 --> 22:12.117
I'm still Hotmail.

22:12.130 --> 22:14.223
Don't judge I'm old.

22:14.230 --> 22:15.788
Well I'll send you my contact

22:15.800 --> 22:17.552
we should get coffee
at the Bradley.

22:17.570 --> 22:19.162
I can bring my mom.

22:19.170 --> 22:20.467
That'd be wonderful.

22:21.270 --> 22:23.295
Well, it's good to see you.

22:23.300 --> 22:24.938
It's great to see you, Hanna.

22:24.940 --> 22:26.965
- Bye, Spencer.
- Bye.

22:26.970 --> 22:30.531
And...let me know
if you see Mary, okay?

22:31.410 --> 22:32.604
The cops are looking for her

22:32.610 --> 22:34.840
and...she could be dangerous.

22:43.460 --> 22:45.382
What did you tell them?

22:46.530 --> 22:49.021
Nothing, just like you asked.

22:53.630 --> 22:55.734
I need to know
why you're really here, Mary?

23:02.280 --> 23:05.534
Six locations and counting,
we could be at this all night.

23:05.550 --> 23:07.438
I wouldn't put it past A.D.

23:07.450 --> 23:09.145
[phone beeping]

23:09.150 --> 23:11.675
- What? _
- Are they coordinates?

23:11.690 --> 23:14.682
No, just duck sounds.

23:14.690 --> 23:17.056
We're supposed to find
a pond or something?

23:18.930 --> 23:22.184
Darling Duck,
that's gotta be it.

23:22.200 --> 23:25.158
I wonder why A.D. wants you
to go in a baby clothes store?

23:26.730 --> 23:28.391
Come on, we need to find
that puzzle piece.

23:28.400 --> 23:29.765
[phone ringing]

23:32.070 --> 23:33.401
Uh..

23:33.410 --> 23:35.435
It's-it's Ezra,
I 'll be right there.

23:39.110 --> 23:42.045
Someone moved your piece
off the game board.

23:42.050 --> 23:44.245
'Do you want to lose?‘

23:44.250 --> 23:46.480
I don't wanna lose, I want out.

23:50.160 --> 23:51.718

[dramatic music]

24:19.450 --> 24:21.042
Alison?

24:21.060 --> 24:23.415
Hi, it's Julie,
we spoke on the phone.

24:23.420 --> 24:24.785
Right, hi.

24:24.790 --> 24:26.451
I was worried you wouldn't
make it before closing.

24:26.460 --> 24:28.052
Okay, so here's your scanner

24:29.360 --> 24:31.794
just point it at the bar code
of the item that you want

24:31.800 --> 24:35.463
and
V0/7a,
it goes
on your registry.

24:35.470 --> 24:37.199
Let me know if you have
any questions.

24:37.910 --> 24:39.207
Alright.

24:39.210 --> 24:40.734
[phone ringing]

24:42.110 --> 24:43.475

- 'It is.'

25:05.030 --> 25:07.828
- 'I'm so excited.‘
- 'Boy or girl?'

25:07.840 --> 25:09.899
I want to keep it a surprise,
you know?

25:09.900 --> 25:12.869
- 'What about you, a girl?'
- 'No.'

25:13.810 --> 25:15.107
(female #1)
'It's great.‘

25:18.980 --> 25:21.346
Rosewood isn't all that bad,
you know?

25:21.350 --> 25:23.045
You're gonna miss the pizza.

25:23.050 --> 25:24.517
I might.

25:27.920 --> 25:31.048
I told Iowa I needed
a little more time to decide.

25:31.060 --> 25:32.118
Really?

25:33.360 --> 25:35.783
You're reconsidering
orchanged?

25:37.530 --> 25:39.862
I remembered something.

25:39.870 --> 25:41.622
I'm not the only one
with demons.

25:42.270 --> 25:44.135
And not facing mine..

25:44.140 --> 25:45.732
...that'd be a lot
like high school too.

25:47.880 --> 25:50.075
This decision was a lot easier
when the world seemed

25:50.080 --> 25:52.002
black and white.

25:52.010 --> 25:54.478
Well, we can always
race for it

25:54.480 --> 25:56.345
like we did back in college.

25:56.350 --> 25:57.715
[chuckles]
Hey, don't knock it.

25:57.720 --> 25:59.642
_ We made a lot
of big deCI5ions that way.

25:59.650 --> 26:01.186
Yeah, like

26:01.190 --> 26:03.715
should we have pizza
for dinner or pad Thai?

26:03.720 --> 26:06.951
English major or biology?
Dorm or off campus apartment?

26:06.960 --> 26:08.757
- You regretted that one.
- Yup.

26:10.970 --> 26:13.598
Let's do it.
Let's race for it.

26:14.900 --> 26:18.097
Paige, I'm not racing
to decide your future.

26:18.110 --> 26:20.135
- I mean, this is your life.
- I know it is.

26:20.140 --> 26:21.869
And I don't know
how else to decide.

26:23.840 --> 26:26.638
I'm serious. Apple Rose
is the finish.

26:26.650 --> 26:29.107
I win I go to Iowa,
you win I stay.

26:30.280 --> 26:31.542
You're insane.

26:31.550 --> 26:33.484
You're just afraid
you're gonna lose.

26:33.490 --> 26:36.789
My bum shoulder can beat your
bum knee any day of the week.

26:37.430 --> 26:39.386
Get ready, go.

26:39.390 --> 26:40.652
Hey, wait up.

26:40.660 --> 26:41.820
It's not a fair start.

26:41.830 --> 26:45.493
My clown let me love you

26:45.500 --> 26:46.865
What's that

Oh oh oh oh

26:57.980 --> 26:59.675
Paige?

27:00.620 --> 27:02.713
Actually I've already decided.

27:02.720 --> 27:04.472
Hey boy won't you take me..

27:04.490 --> 27:05.878
I'm staying.

27:05.890 --> 27:07.744
I'm not afraid
of all the reasons

27:07.760 --> 27:09.557
Why we shouldn't try

27:09.560 --> 27:11.414
Oh oh oh oh

27:11.430 --> 27:14.786
Oh oh oh oh

27:28.180 --> 27:30.705
How did it go?

27:30.710 --> 27:34.043
- Fine.
- Oh, wait.

27:34.050 --> 27:37.076
Don't forget, the item
you asked us to put on hold.

27:37.080 --> 27:38.718
For the donor.

27:39.750 --> 27:42.184
What?
What did you say?

27:42.190 --> 27:44.681
You asked us to put this on hold
for the egg donor.

27:45.660 --> 27:47.651
We personalized it
and everything.

27:57.470 --> 27:59.062
(Em/7y)
’You ’re donat/hg your eggs. ’

27:59.070 --> 28:00.560
- When is this happen/77g?
- Today.

28:00.570 --> 28:02.629
They’re my eggs
and I made the decision.

28:02.640 --> 28:04.733
I wanna neio someone
to start fam/iy if] can.

28:04.750 --> 28:06.206
They’re my eggs and I. .

28:06.210 --> 28:07.848
They’re my eggs
and I made the decision.

28:07.850 --> 28:09.306
My eggs. My eggs.

28:09.320 --> 28:11.811
They’re my eggs
and I made the decision.

28:11.820 --> 28:13.139
Are you okay?

28:13.150 --> 28:15.710
- Do you need to sit down?
- Where is it?

28:15.720 --> 28:17.278
What, what are you looking for?

28:17.290 --> 28:20.350
The puzzle piece. They must have
told you to put it somewhere.

28:20.360 --> 28:22.920
- I'm not sure.
- I need it.

28:22.930 --> 28:25.148
Okay, I need
that damn puzzle piece.

28:25.170 --> 28:27.422
I'm sorry, I don't know what
piece you're talking about.

28:27.440 --> 28:29.692
(Em/7y)
You ’re donating your eggs.

28:32.140 --> 28:34.836
My eggs and I made
the decision.

28:34.840 --> 28:37.206
They’re my eggs
and I made the decision.

- A.D.?

[dramatic music]

29:42.110 --> 29:44.305
You shot Spencer?
You helped Jenna escape?

29:44.310 --> 29:46.642
- You made up the game?
- Correct.

29:46.650 --> 29:50.211
I barely know you, Sydney,
why are you doing this?

29:50.220 --> 29:52.108
If this has anything
to do with Jenna--

29:52.120 --> 29:54.782
- It doesn't.
- Why now?

29:54.790 --> 29:56.417
Why are you letting me
see who you are?

29:56.420 --> 29:58.809
Because you're desperate
and I can use desperate.

30:01.430 --> 30:03.625
You said you want out
of the game?

30:03.630 --> 30:05.359
Yes, the game.

30:05.370 --> 30:07.930
- All of it.
- And what about your friends?

30:07.940 --> 30:10.158
- What about them?
- Do they know you're here?

30:12.740 --> 30:14.435
- No.
- Good.

30:15.340 --> 30:16.807
[phone ringing]

30:26.890 --> 30:28.812
Let's take the scenic route.

30:35.360 --> 30:36.827
Is beer alright?

30:36.830 --> 30:39.128
Uh, sure, anything.

30:39.130 --> 30:42.725
I was hoping to hear from you
soon, but I didn't expect today.

30:42.740 --> 30:44.992
- This place is-—
- Not mine.

30:45.010 --> 30:47.001
It's a friend's.
I mean the mess is mine

30:47.010 --> 30:49.308
but all the nice stuff
is on loan.

30:52.650 --> 30:53.969
Are you okay?

30:54.920 --> 30:56.842
I lied to you today.

30:57.790 --> 30:59.041
About Mary.

31:00.020 --> 31:02.443
I have seen her.

31:02.460 --> 31:04.883
In fact she spent the last
two nights on my sofa.

31:10.460 --> 31:11.791
Drink?

31:11.800 --> 31:13.028
No.

31:20.980 --> 31:22.868
So what happens next?

31:23.510 --> 31:24.602
How do I get out?

31:25.350 --> 31:27.204
There is no out.

31:27.210 --> 31:30.008
But you could change sides,
be a part of the winning team.

31:30.020 --> 31:31.772
You want me to join you

31:31.790 --> 31:33.519
in torturing my friends?

31:33.520 --> 31:36.216
You and whoever's on the other
end of that ear piece.

31:36.790 --> 31:38.519
No, never.

31:41.130 --> 31:42.483
I wouldn't do that.

31:47.230 --> 31:50.563
Leaving Allie and coming here
was an important step

31:50.570 --> 31:51.889
toward earning A.D.'s trust

31:51.910 --> 31:53.502
but you still have
a long way to go

31:53.510 --> 31:54.909
and a decision to make.

31:54.910 --> 31:56.377
[tires screeching]

(Aria)
'Why are you doing this?'

32:05.090 --> 32:07.388
You, Sydney,
why are you doing this?

32:07.390 --> 32:10.086
_Because it's no fun
being on the losmg team.

32:10.090 --> 32:13.287
[instrumental music]

32:18.100 --> 32:20.091
I knew Mary
when I was in college.

32:21.570 --> 32:25.233
I was a senior _ _
and she was...a free spirit.

32:26.270 --> 32:28.602
We dated for a while and..

32:28.610 --> 32:31.170
...and she just disappeared.

32:31.180 --> 32:33.398
Why didn't you tell us
about this before?

32:33.410 --> 32:35.503
Because I'd already
promised Mary I wouldn't

32:35.520 --> 32:37.340
tell anyone
she was staying with me.

32:37.350 --> 32:39.614
I was trying to keep my word
to an old friend.

32:42.220 --> 32:44.279
I mean that was before.

32:46.860 --> 32:48.487
Before what?

32:50.230 --> 32:52.528
After your visit..

32:52.530 --> 32:55.021
...I asked Mary
why she really came to see me

32:55.040 --> 32:56.598
after all this time?

32:59.440 --> 33:01.465
She told me we had
a child together.

33:03.810 --> 33:05.402
Charlotte?

33:07.480 --> 33:08.742
Yeah.

33:11.650 --> 33:14.312
Only I knew her as Charles.

33:14.320 --> 33:17.448
Fifteen years ago,
I ran a camp for troubled boys

33:17.460 --> 33:19.348
and Charles
was one of my campers.

33:20.230 --> 33:24.257
He was...soft-spoken, sweet.

33:25.570 --> 33:28.198
'Way smarter
than all the other kids.'

33:28.970 --> 33:30.460
I had no idea..

33:31.540 --> 33:33.269
That she was your child.

33:37.180 --> 33:40.741
The other boy in this photo,
do you know his name?

33:40.750 --> 33:42.775
That was Charles' only friend.

33:42.780 --> 33:46.443
He was...Luke or Lucas maybe.

33:48.360 --> 33:51.215
- Lucas Gottesman?
- You know him?

33:52.260 --> 33:53.784
You're sitting on his couch.

33:57.030 --> 33:58.292
[sighs]

33:59.100 --> 34:00.658
What did A.D. make you do?

34:02.540 --> 34:04.030
Allison?

34:04.040 --> 34:06.031
What did you have to do
to get the puzzle piece?

34:07.880 --> 34:09.563
Find out the truth
about the baby..

34:11.210 --> 34:13.075
...or at least I think
it's the truth.

34:18.590 --> 34:20.080
It's not mine, Emily.

34:20.890 --> 34:22.243
It's yours.

34:23.390 --> 34:25.210
What are you talkin' about?

34:27.160 --> 34:28.821
They're your eggs.

34:28.830 --> 34:30.593
The ones you donated.

34:32.730 --> 34:34.960
You were right.

34:34.970 --> 34:36.597
A.D. stole them.

34:39.640 --> 34:42.507
They must have been planning
this for a really long time.

34:44.680 --> 34:46.079
Allie..

34:47.180 --> 34:51.344
Just because A.D. said so..

34:51.350 --> 34:53.284
...that doesn't mean
that it's true.

34:54.220 --> 34:56.609
I remember
the procedure, Em.

34:58.530 --> 35:00.725
They wheeled me
out of my room at Welby.

35:02.430 --> 35:04.819
It wasn ’tArcher,
it was someone else.

35:06.030 --> 35:07.622
They strapped me down.

35:08.770 --> 35:10.431
I tried to stay to awake.

35:10.440 --> 35:12.931
I tried to ﬁght it
but it was no use.

35:12.940 --> 35:15.704
[intense music]

35:30.660 --> 35:33.527
Dad. God, you scared me.

35:33.530 --> 35:37.751
I've been waiting for you
for hours. I was worried sick.

35:37.760 --> 35:40.820
- Well I was just--
- Looking for Mary. I know.

35:40.830 --> 35:43.731
I spoke with my investigator.
I figured out the rest.

35:43.740 --> 35:47.528
- What were you thinking?
- That I needed to talk to her.

35:47.540 --> 35:49.974
That I have questions
and they need answers.

35:49.980 --> 35:51.777
Mary is dangerous, Spencer.

35:51.780 --> 35:55.147
- She cannot be trusted.
- Oh, and you can?

35:55.150 --> 35:57.141
Do you hear yourself?

35:57.150 --> 35:59.414
You've been lying to me
for my entire life

35:59.420 --> 36:01.285
literally from day one!

36:01.290 --> 36:02.416
There are things
about this woman

36:02.420 --> 36:04.217
that you just don't understand.

36:05.530 --> 36:07.623
Then tell me.

36:07.630 --> 36:10.497
Try being honest
for once in your life.

36:10.500 --> 36:12.695
Or I'm gonna walk out that door
and I won't come back.

36:17.140 --> 36:18.539
Okay.

36:21.840 --> 36:23.171
The last time I saw Mary

36:23.180 --> 36:25.205
was when you came back
from rehab.

36:27.080 --> 36:30.277
[dramatic music]

36:33.320 --> 36:34.787
(Ms. Hastings)
Spencer?‘

36:36.020 --> 36:37.487
Spencer.

36:38.560 --> 36:40.619
Are you okay?

36:45.430 --> 36:47.466
[music continues]

36:56.540 --> 36:57.973
Jessica, what are you doing
here?

37:00.850 --> 37:02.374
What the hell are you
doing in my house

37:02.380 --> 37:03.745
in the middle of the night?

37:04.990 --> 37:07.049
I had to see her.

37:07.050 --> 37:08.608
It was just one look.

37:08.620 --> 37:10.588
She's beautiful,
isn't she, Peter?

37:12.160 --> 37:13.479
Our daughter.

37:16.230 --> 37:17.549
Mary?

37:20.300 --> 37:21.858
She wanted to see me?

37:22.600 --> 37:25.194
No, Spencer.

37:25.210 --> 37:27.007
She wanted revenge.

37:27.010 --> 37:29.001
[music continues]

37:33.750 --> 37:35.604
Mary was unhinged
to say the least.

37:36.720 --> 37:39.473
Jessica told her
that Charles was dead.

37:39.490 --> 37:40.889
'Somehow she found out
that wasn't true.‘

37:40.890 --> 37:44.678
That Charles was Charlotte
and alive.

37:44.690 --> 37:47.579
She couldn't believe Jessica
lied to her like that.

37:47.590 --> 37:49.524
She wanted her to pay,
she wanted her dead.

37:49.530 --> 37:51.555
And when I refused to help

37:51.570 --> 37:53.390
she turned on me too.

37:54.400 --> 37:56.368
Mary killed her sister.

37:56.370 --> 37:57.598
She used my pills to do it

37:57.600 --> 37:59.739
and she buried her
in our baclqard.

37:59.740 --> 38:01.401
She killed Jessica
and did everything

38:01.410 --> 38:02.934
she could to frame me for it.

38:03.640 --> 38:04.709
Are you sure?

38:06.110 --> 38:07.646
I mean, they were sisters.

38:08.250 --> 38:09.945
Twins.

38:09.950 --> 38:11.247
Now, do you understand

38:11.250 --> 38:13.741
why I don't want you
to find her

38:13.750 --> 38:15.638
why I want to keep her away
from this family?

38:16.820 --> 38:19.050
You knew about Charlotte

38:19.060 --> 38:20.550
before the doll house?

38:22.000 --> 38:23.399
I'll be damned if I ever

38:23.400 --> 38:26.619
let something like that
happen to you again.

38:26.630 --> 38:28.825
Now, you can hate me, Spencer,
I can live with that.

38:29.970 --> 38:32.598
But please, please,
let me protect you.

38:42.120 --> 38:43.815
I want to cancel

Do you need anything? Tea?

39:13.650 --> 39:16.073
- No.
-Em?

39:17.450 --> 39:20.817
Hey, guys, sorry I'm late.
What's going on?

39:20.820 --> 39:23.948
Where were you?
We were calling?

39:23.960 --> 39:25.450
Yeah, I'm sorry.

39:25.460 --> 39:27.257
I was helping Ezra with Nicole.

39:27.260 --> 39:28.352
Did something happen?

39:28.360 --> 39:30.453
Yeah. Something happened.

39:30.460 --> 39:32.121
For starters, you left Allie.

39:32.130 --> 39:34.325
You just abandoned her
when she needed you.

39:34.330 --> 39:36.560
Allie, I'm sorry.

39:37.770 --> 39:40.159
- Are you okay?
- No, no. She's not okay.

39:40.170 --> 39:43.105
- I'm not okay. No one's okay.
- Em, she doesn't know.

39:43.110 --> 39:44.304
I don't know what?

39:44.310 --> 39:45.971
That A.D. stopped playing games

39:45.980 --> 39:47.402
and started playing God.

39:50.020 --> 39:53.683
A.D. stole Emily's eggs
from the donation bank

39:53.690 --> 39:56.750
fertilized them and then
used them to impregnate Allie.

39:59.490 --> 40:01.981
- What?
- God, it still sounds crazy.

40:03.400 --> 40:05.550
Guys..

40:05.570 --> 40:08.061
Um, I don't know what to say.

40:10.140 --> 40:12.495
No one can imagine how violated

40:12.510 --> 40:14.660
'and confused you both
must feel right now'

40:14.670 --> 40:16.137
'but Aria's turn is up next'

40:16.140 --> 40:18.938
'and who knows what A.D.'s
gonna do to her.‘

40:18.950 --> 40:20.747
We need each other.

40:20.750 --> 40:23.913
We cannot let this game
rip us apart no matter what.

- That's not right.

41:03.290 --> 41:05.087
I'm not playing,
I just-I just went.

41:05.090 --> 41:07.058
No. It's Aria's turn.
It's supposed to land on Aria.

41:07.060 --> 41:09.779
I know, I..
I don't know what happened.

41:09.800 --> 41:11.756
Maybe you get a do over because
you didn't get your piece.

41:11.770 --> 41:13.726
Do over?
It just wrecked my life!

41:13.730 --> 41:16.221
- Han, it's gonna be okay.
- No, it's not!

41:16.240 --> 41:17.798
- Oh, God! I can't do this.
- It's broken.

41:17.800 --> 41:19.597
The game's gotta be broken.

41:19.610 --> 41:21.760
It's not broken.

what it's doing.

ever settle
