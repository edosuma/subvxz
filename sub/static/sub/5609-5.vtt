NARRATOR: Previously on
Once Upon A Time...

00:03.253 --> 00:05.505
-USHER: Don't do it, Emma.
-How do you know my name?

00:05.589 --> 00:06.578
I know many things.

00:06.673 --> 00:07.662
And I'm here to tell you,

00:07.758 --> 00:09.714
leave the sword alone.

00:09.760 --> 00:11.625
I would do anything for my kingdom.

00:11.762 --> 00:13.298
Which is why I need you to drink this.

00:13.430 --> 00:16.422
Your death Will be the cornerstone
of a great new Kingdom.

00:16.475 --> 00:17.464
We can't trust Arthur.

00:17.559 --> 00:20.050
ARTHUR: Pity your husband
didn't listen when you tried to warn him.

00:20.103 --> 00:22.139
Turns out, David was right.
We can trust Arthur.

00:24.024 --> 00:25.104
You could just set me free.

00:25.150 --> 00:27.687
The only one
who can get me that sword is you.

00:27.778 --> 00:28.767
I can't.

00:39.706 --> 00:40.821
MERLIN: Dark One!

00:41.667 --> 00:42.952
Dark One!

00:43.752 --> 00:45.208
(WIND HOWLING)

00:47.798 --> 00:49.163
Enough.

00:49.258 --> 00:50.668
I command you to stop!

00:54.680 --> 00:56.796
You destroyed her.

00:59.560 --> 01:01.516
The only woman I ever loved.

01:03.981 --> 01:05.187
MERLIN: And now,

01:06.858 --> 01:08.268
I will destroy you.

01:21.456 --> 01:22.741
I can't.

01:25.711 --> 01:26.951
(SOBS)

01:31.675 --> 01:33.586
I miss her.

02:46.416 --> 02:49.624
You really think giving the dagger to
Arthur is the best way to help Emma?

02:49.711 --> 02:50.700
We trust him.

02:50.754 --> 02:52.164
lmplicitly.

02:52.255 --> 02:54.337
Did you learn those big words
at shepherd school?

02:55.133 --> 02:56.794
How do you know you can trust him?

02:56.927 --> 02:59.088
Because we're
good judges of character.

02:59.137 --> 03:01.924
And we would never act
against Emma's best interest.

03:03.100 --> 03:04.590
Is the dagger in there?

03:11.358 --> 03:15.146
Are you sure handing the one thing
that can control your daughter

03:15.278 --> 03:16.939
over to Arthur is the right thing to do?

03:17.030 --> 03:18.611
Have you lost
the power of comprehension?

03:19.282 --> 03:20.658
Hand over the...

03:22.619 --> 03:23.699
What're you doing?

03:24.663 --> 03:26.824
When did you get so
liberal with dark magic?

03:26.957 --> 03:29.699
No choice. Arthur has them
under some kind of spell.

03:29.793 --> 03:32.830
He wants them to bring him the dagger,
he wants to reunite it with Excalibur.

03:32.963 --> 03:34.453
Unite it?

03:34.548 --> 03:35.708
It was once one blade.

03:35.799 --> 03:37.790
It was broken in half
a long, long time ago.

03:37.843 --> 03:39.629
What happens when they're together?

03:39.720 --> 03:41.381
He wants to kill Merlin with it.

03:41.471 --> 03:43.632
I don't have to tell you
how bad that would be for all of us.

03:43.682 --> 03:45.798
How do you know this?

03:45.892 --> 03:48.804
How do I know this isn't
the darkness in you rearing its head?

03:48.854 --> 03:52.392
It's true. We don't have a lot of time,
Arthur's expecting them soon.

03:52.482 --> 03:54.473
He's the King.

03:54.526 --> 03:56.312
So you want to take on all of Camelot?

03:56.361 --> 03:57.476
I want to free Merlin first.

03:57.571 --> 03:59.482
Then I could help my parents
and stop Arthur.

04:00.157 --> 04:02.990
That's a great plan, but we have
no idea how to get him out of the tree.

04:03.076 --> 04:04.156
You already said it.

04:05.203 --> 04:06.488
Dark magic.

04:06.580 --> 04:09.322
No. You can't keep using it.

04:09.374 --> 04:10.989
It's a risk I'm willing to take.

04:11.084 --> 04:12.665
Careful, Emma.

04:14.004 --> 04:17.713
I've been on that slippery slope.
You know where it got me.

04:19.509 --> 04:21.170
All due respect,

04:22.304 --> 04:23.794
I'm not you.

04:28.185 --> 04:31.177
So he just vanished?

04:32.522 --> 04:35.480
Could it be magic?
Your squire, did he wield such power?

04:35.525 --> 04:36.560
Not that I ever saw.

04:36.693 --> 04:38.729
Well, there's no sign of tampering.

04:39.404 --> 04:41.861
Then he must have
lied about having the bean.

04:41.907 --> 04:44.239
Must have hidden it on his person
somewhere and used it to escape.

04:44.367 --> 04:47.495
How could he be so selfish?
We could all be home right now.

04:48.038 --> 04:49.073
Desperate times.

04:49.873 --> 04:52.034
Our people want so badly to return.

04:52.375 --> 04:54.661
We must do something
to raise their spirits.

04:54.711 --> 04:57.373
The despair of being away,
that's what caused all this.

04:58.006 --> 04:59.667
Who knows what else it can lead to?

04:59.716 --> 05:02.503
Well, you're right. People need hope.

05:02.552 --> 05:05.885
And as your hosts
and leaders of this town,

05:06.014 --> 05:07.379
it is up to us to provide it.

05:08.391 --> 05:09.676
What do you have in mind?

05:13.271 --> 05:15.011
How about a dance?

05:15.065 --> 05:16.521
DAVID: Dance, huh?

05:16.566 --> 05:19.729
Looking for an excuse
to ask your girlfriend out on a date?

05:19.861 --> 05:22.068
Girlfriend? What girlfriend?

05:22.113 --> 05:23.444
She's not my girlfriend.

05:23.573 --> 05:24.562
Who's not your girlfriend?

05:24.699 --> 05:26.735
I think a dance is exactly what we need.

05:26.785 --> 05:28.116
Henry, who's this girlfriend?

05:28.245 --> 05:32.579
Well, if it's dating tips you need, lad,
I know my way around women.

05:32.707 --> 05:33.958
Over your dead body.

05:34.084 --> 05:36.200
MARY: Regina, let's start planning.

05:36.253 --> 05:38.710
I think it is time Storybrooke had a ball.

05:44.219 --> 05:45.959
So who is this girlfriend?

05:46.096 --> 05:47.586
What do you know about her?

05:47.639 --> 05:48.924
MARY: Belle, what is it?

05:49.057 --> 05:50.297
It's... It's Rumple.

05:50.392 --> 05:51.381
MARY: What happened?

05:51.434 --> 05:52.890
He's missing.

05:58.108 --> 05:59.097
Better eat up.

05:59.234 --> 06:02.726
You need your strength if you're
going to remove this sword.

06:11.621 --> 06:13.282
I won't be able to do that.

06:13.957 --> 06:16.448
You should reallyjust let me go.

06:17.919 --> 06:18.908
Please.

06:20.338 --> 06:22.124
I need to see Belle.

06:23.508 --> 06:26.966
You're not going anywhere
until you get me my sword.

06:28.054 --> 06:30.921
Well, you have so much power,
why do you need Excalibur?

06:30.974 --> 06:33.761
Tell me, when you were the Dark One,
did you advertise your plans?

06:35.478 --> 06:38.641
My plans were always hidden.

06:38.732 --> 06:40.973
But my reasons were not.

06:41.568 --> 06:43.650
Every time I used magic,

06:43.778 --> 06:47.066
I told myself it was all for my son.

06:47.157 --> 06:48.237
To protect him.

06:48.325 --> 06:49.656
How noble.

06:49.743 --> 06:52.280
Despite my best intentions,

06:52.954 --> 06:54.285
I still lost him.

06:54.331 --> 06:56.822
I'm stronger than you were.

07:05.752 --> 07:07.510
That really doesn't matter.

07:07.510 --> 07:10.843
The more you justify what you're doing,

07:11.514 --> 07:14.426
the more you push them away.

07:14.517 --> 07:16.599
Take it from me,

07:17.479 --> 07:20.971
you will always lose
the ones you love the most.

07:24.027 --> 07:25.642
Merida.

07:27.864 --> 07:29.365
Yes, Dark One?

07:29.449 --> 07:31.906
Get him out of my sight.
Take him to the woods and begin.

07:31.993 --> 07:34.860
How long do you think you can
hold my heart and threaten me?

07:34.955 --> 07:37.037
As long as it takes
for me to get what I want.

07:37.123 --> 07:39.990
Maybe,
but I'm thinking I can break your spell.

07:40.043 --> 07:41.032
(MERIDA GASPS)

07:42.253 --> 07:46.166
Now take him to the woods
and make me a hero.

07:46.216 --> 07:47.205
(STRUGGLES)

08:00.981 --> 08:02.391
(DOOR OPENS)

08:43.857 --> 08:46.064
First, we need to know how the potion
you've been working on

08:46.151 --> 08:47.857
will react to my dark magic.

08:47.944 --> 08:49.059
Bring me the vial.

08:49.154 --> 08:50.314
I'm not doing a damn thing

08:50.405 --> 08:53.818
until you tell me how you knew David
and Mary Margaret were under a spell.

08:53.908 --> 08:55.318
We don't have time for this.

08:55.410 --> 08:56.775
Make time.

09:00.165 --> 09:02.156
Fine. I saw it in this.

09:02.250 --> 09:03.956
A dreamcatcher.

09:05.336 --> 09:06.872
Emma, this is dark magic.

09:08.131 --> 09:09.120
I know.

09:09.215 --> 09:11.171
These things catch more than dreams.

09:11.259 --> 09:12.248
I know.

09:12.302 --> 09:14.634
And you have to wave it over someone
to capture a memory.

09:14.721 --> 09:15.756
I don't.

09:16.848 --> 09:18.429
This dark magic is stronger,

09:18.516 --> 09:21.679
more unpredictable
than any magic I've ever used.

09:21.770 --> 09:23.476
The image just appeared.

09:23.563 --> 09:26.020
It showed me what Arthur did to them.

09:26.107 --> 09:27.483
Look, it's gonna be okay.

09:27.567 --> 09:29.979
The dreamcatcher also showed me
a memory that's going to help us.

09:31.404 --> 09:32.940
Merlin's.

09:33.031 --> 09:34.646
I saw him.

09:34.741 --> 09:37.824
Merlin wept for the loss
of the only woman he ever loved

09:37.911 --> 09:40.277
moments before
the Dark One trapped him in the tree

09:40.371 --> 09:42.362
using one of his tears.

09:43.166 --> 09:44.326
Emma, that's it.

09:45.376 --> 09:47.788
Sometimes spells are like snakebites.

09:47.879 --> 09:50.416
You can make
the anti-venom with the venom.

09:51.091 --> 09:54.504
If a tear of lost love trapped Merlin,

09:55.762 --> 09:58.128
then another one
might be able to get him out.

09:58.223 --> 10:00.088
So what do you say?

10:00.183 --> 10:02.344
So let's go get ourselves a tear.

10:14.114 --> 10:16.070
So how long have you had Nicodemus?

10:16.825 --> 10:19.032
VIOLET: My mother gave it to me
for my seventh birthday.

10:19.828 --> 10:21.318
She was the champion rider.

10:23.581 --> 10:27.870
But she passed away
before I even learned to gallop.

10:31.047 --> 10:33.584
My dad died before
I really got the chance to know him.

10:35.385 --> 10:39.094
There's just so much I wish
I could tell him, you know?

10:47.105 --> 10:49.221
Yes, I do know.

10:54.737 --> 10:57.979
I've never met anyone
I could talk to about this before.

11:03.246 --> 11:06.409
I should put Nico's saddle away.
I'll be right back.

11:18.553 --> 11:19.713
What's that, Lady Violet?

11:21.264 --> 11:25.177
Ifl pull Excalibur from this stone,
I will be forever your hero?

11:39.324 --> 11:41.315
(NEIGHING)

11:42.327 --> 11:43.908
MORGAN:
What is going on in here?

11:47.373 --> 11:51.161
You're one of those visitors, aren't you?
From the other land.

11:54.589 --> 11:56.170
Yes.

11:56.799 --> 11:59.666
You're the one who's been
running around with my daughter.

12:00.303 --> 12:03.795
Henry. You're Violet's father?

12:03.890 --> 12:06.097
You may address me as Sir Morgan.

12:06.851 --> 12:08.307
How old are you, boy?

12:08.394 --> 12:10.259
Thirteen, sir.

12:10.355 --> 12:12.596
And no skills with a sword or a horse?

12:12.690 --> 12:14.271
What sort of squire are you?

12:16.110 --> 12:19.398
I'm not a squire, sir. I'm a writer.

12:19.489 --> 12:21.070
A writer?

12:21.699 --> 12:26.443
Tell me, boy, when this kingdom
is attacked by ogres,

12:26.537 --> 12:28.402
will you protect my daughter
with your pen?

12:30.166 --> 12:33.750
Violet belongs with someone
who will become a knight.

12:33.836 --> 12:36.418
A hero who understands this world.

12:36.506 --> 12:37.712
Someone like her.

12:37.840 --> 12:40.877
Now get out of here
before you cause any more damage.

12:45.723 --> 12:46.929
Hey. Did you see my text?

12:47.684 --> 12:49.049
About the block party.

12:49.227 --> 12:50.933
Oh. Yes.

12:51.854 --> 12:53.355
Everything okay?

12:54.274 --> 12:56.936
No, I'm afraid
I'm not in the mood for parties.

12:57.026 --> 12:58.937
My horse ran off this morning.

12:59.862 --> 13:02.274
Oh, no. Did you check the stables?

13:02.865 --> 13:04.116
He's gone.

13:04.200 --> 13:06.691
My father's out right now
trying to lure Nico with some pumpkin.

13:07.537 --> 13:09.243
It's his favorite treat.

13:09.372 --> 13:13.285
It's okay. He'll come back.
The town isn't that big.

13:14.585 --> 13:16.541
Maybe tonight will help you
get your mind off of it.

13:17.213 --> 13:22.173
Henry, I can't go dancing
or go to a party or anything,

13:22.218 --> 13:23.719
not while he's still out there.

13:23.761 --> 13:27.629
I'm gonna find your horse, Violet.
And I knowjust the person to help.

13:28.933 --> 13:30.048
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

13:34.564 --> 13:37.226
Do you remember why I first
brought you to Storybrooke?

13:37.275 --> 13:40.767
Of course. Operation Cobra.
Bring back all the happy endings.

13:40.903 --> 13:43.064
Well, your mission isn't over.

13:43.114 --> 13:45.651
Henry, things are different now.

13:46.743 --> 13:48.734
They don't have to be.

13:48.828 --> 13:50.989
Show me that the mom I know
is still in there somewhere.

13:51.831 --> 13:54.664
She is. This is me.

13:54.751 --> 13:56.662
Then prove it.

13:56.753 --> 13:59.415
Help me return
my friend's happy ending.

14:05.094 --> 14:06.550
MERIDA: Don't think
about running with that limp,

14:06.596 --> 14:07.585
you wouldn't make it 10 feet.

14:07.764 --> 14:09.800
Pick up the bloody sword
and let's make a hero of you.

14:09.932 --> 14:13.299
But, I can barely stand,
much less fight someone.

14:24.614 --> 14:25.945
Now you can stand.

14:27.950 --> 14:30.202
All a man needs is a sword
and one good hand.

14:30.286 --> 14:31.867
You've got both, so pick it up.

14:38.461 --> 14:39.746
(PANTING)

14:41.339 --> 14:42.795
Look, this is useless.

14:43.341 --> 14:45.206
GOLD: If she wants me to pull Excalibur,

14:45.301 --> 14:46.711
then let me try.

14:46.803 --> 14:48.168
When I fail, she can move on.

14:48.304 --> 14:50.135
When you fail, there's no moving on,
you turn to dust.

14:50.181 --> 14:51.796
What do you care what happens to me?

14:51.891 --> 14:53.847
I don't! I care what happens to me.

14:53.976 --> 14:55.307
And my brothers and my kingdom.

14:55.353 --> 14:57.344
None of which I can help
while this goes on!

14:57.480 --> 14:59.812
So whether you like it or not,
you're going to get me home.

15:01.567 --> 15:03.353
I can never be brave.

15:03.486 --> 15:05.067
My whole fate rests in a coward's hands.

15:05.154 --> 15:07.406
It's really come to this.

15:07.490 --> 15:09.902
Yes, you will be. You have to.

15:09.992 --> 15:11.983
You have the wrong man.

15:16.874 --> 15:18.489
Well, if words won't drive you,

15:18.543 --> 15:21.000
we'll have to figure another way,
now won't we?

15:21.045 --> 15:23.036
There has to be something.

15:23.172 --> 15:25.083
And I'm gonna find it.

15:32.348 --> 15:34.179
DARK SWAN: So the horse
likes pumpkin, huh?

15:34.267 --> 15:36.929
Yeah. Violet's dad
is out trying to lure it with some.

15:37.019 --> 15:40.386
Back in my bail bondsperson days,
I caught a guy because he loved pizza,

15:40.523 --> 15:43.515
but I didn't walk around randomly
holding a slice of pepperoni.

15:43.609 --> 15:45.065
There is a better way.

15:45.194 --> 15:47.685
I've missed this. Us.

15:47.780 --> 15:49.236
Operation Cobra.

15:50.533 --> 15:51.568
Me too.

15:56.414 --> 15:58.530
So, tell me about you and Violet.

15:59.083 --> 16:01.620
She's okay.
We like some of the same stuff.

16:01.711 --> 16:03.042
Like what?

16:03.087 --> 16:04.623
I played her some music
and she was into it.

16:04.714 --> 16:06.375
What did you play?

16:06.424 --> 16:07.630
-Yes.
-What song?

16:07.717 --> 16:09.253
Only You.

16:10.720 --> 16:12.210
Did your dad teach you that move?

16:12.305 --> 16:13.886
He said it always works.

16:14.932 --> 16:18.265
It did with me. He loved that song.

16:19.061 --> 16:20.221
It's a good song.

16:20.897 --> 16:22.387
Yeah, it is.

16:25.443 --> 16:27.775
Okay, let's get your girl's horse.

16:27.904 --> 16:29.895
I have a good idea where to start.

16:40.958 --> 16:43.074
REGINA: Henry, careful.

16:44.462 --> 16:45.998
Hey, Moms.

16:49.425 --> 16:51.837
You know,
trying to understand this world.

16:51.928 --> 16:53.759
By sword fighting?

16:55.014 --> 16:57.596
Well, Sir Morgan, Violet's father,

16:57.642 --> 17:00.133
had a little advice for me to fit in.
That's all.

17:00.269 --> 17:04.057
Trouble is, I'm not sure if I'm ever
gonna be good at this knight stuff.

17:04.774 --> 17:07.766
Well, if you're not, you're not.

17:07.818 --> 17:09.979
But changing because
someone likes you never works.

17:10.112 --> 17:13.775
I mean, I liked your dad because
he was always himself.

17:14.492 --> 17:18.781
But maybe if I try,
I could be something better than I am.

17:19.622 --> 17:21.158
If you didn't change for the better,

17:21.290 --> 17:22.746
you wouldn't be with Robin.

17:22.792 --> 17:24.657
True.

17:24.794 --> 17:26.785
But do you really think
a girl from Camelot

17:26.921 --> 17:30.630
would be interested in someone who's
just like every other boy around here?

17:30.675 --> 17:33.007
Remember when I told you
about Daniel?

17:34.011 --> 17:36.798
-Yeah. Your first love.
-Mmm-hmm.

17:37.807 --> 17:41.015
And it wasn't because he tried to
impress me by being like the others.

17:41.143 --> 17:44.135
It was because he was so different.

17:44.272 --> 17:45.682
So unique.

17:45.815 --> 17:47.476
EMMA: Henry, in Camelot,

17:47.608 --> 17:50.475
you are a mysterious stranger
from an exotic land.

17:50.528 --> 17:51.984
That's a good thing.

17:53.197 --> 17:55.654
I think I can work with that. Thanks.

17:56.617 --> 17:58.482
I have to go make a few arrangements.

18:04.333 --> 18:06.164
Emma,

18:06.294 --> 18:09.707
I think I might know where to get
our missing ingredient to free Merlin.

18:10.881 --> 18:12.166
From me.

18:16.178 --> 18:19.341
All right, Regina,
this is going to be intense.

18:19.890 --> 18:21.471
Last chance to back out.

18:22.518 --> 18:24.019
I can take it.

18:30.818 --> 18:32.479
Look into the circle.

18:34.155 --> 18:38.023
So this is your decision?
This will make you happy?

18:38.075 --> 18:40.157
It already has.

18:41.704 --> 18:43.069
Then who am I to stop you?

18:51.172 --> 18:52.537
Thank you, Mother.

18:54.884 --> 18:56.374
Daniel...

19:00.723 --> 19:04.011
If you want to have
a life together, a family,

19:04.060 --> 19:08.053
then there is one important lesson
I can impart on you.

19:08.105 --> 19:09.845
It's what it means to be a parent.

19:10.566 --> 19:14.104
You always have to do
what's best for your children.

19:14.737 --> 19:16.022
(GROANS)

19:16.739 --> 19:17.774
Mother!

19:17.865 --> 19:19.230
(GASPING)

19:20.743 --> 19:23.576
(WAILING) No! No!

19:26.957 --> 19:28.743
I'm sorry.

19:30.920 --> 19:33.411
It was like it was happening
all over again.

19:36.759 --> 19:37.748
(GASPS)

19:38.052 --> 19:39.087
Got it.

19:41.389 --> 19:43.095
Thank you.

19:43.224 --> 19:46.261
I didn't know how things were for you.
I didn't know.

19:46.394 --> 19:47.759
You could see it, too?

19:47.812 --> 19:49.393
I'm so sorry.

19:50.898 --> 19:53.480
I don't understand how a mother
could do something like that.

19:55.069 --> 19:57.105
She thought it was for the best.

20:03.619 --> 20:06.907
Showtime.
Henry says he's got Emma occupied.

20:06.956 --> 20:08.617
You told Henry what we're doing?

20:08.749 --> 20:11.286
No, but he'll let us know
when she's headed back.

20:11.419 --> 20:12.955
Let's do this.

20:16.465 --> 20:17.454
(INHALES)

20:18.092 --> 20:19.298
You okay?

20:19.969 --> 20:21.254
Protection spell.

20:21.303 --> 20:23.965
Well, appears she doesn't
want you trespassing.

20:25.182 --> 20:26.342
You want to try, pirate?

20:26.475 --> 20:28.431
Well, I know she doesn't want me to.

20:30.187 --> 20:33.975
Henry. She'd let Henry in.

20:34.108 --> 20:35.973
Do you have anything of his on you?

20:37.319 --> 20:38.934
I do now.

20:40.740 --> 20:41.729
(DOOR OPENS)

20:43.993 --> 20:47.326
Thank you, Henry. You're our hero.

21:18.444 --> 21:19.433
Uh...

21:19.528 --> 21:21.109
Hi, m'lady.

21:21.197 --> 21:23.529
I mean, Violet. I mean...

21:24.366 --> 21:25.697
Please sit down.

21:26.368 --> 21:27.357
(CHUCKLES)

21:27.995 --> 21:29.531
Thank you.

21:38.172 --> 21:40.538
VIOLET: I was really happy
to get your note.

21:40.674 --> 21:42.801
I was worried when you
disappeared from the stables.

21:43.677 --> 21:45.053
You were?

21:45.179 --> 21:46.464
Yes.

21:50.476 --> 21:52.057
You wanted me to worry?

21:52.144 --> 21:54.476
Yes. I mean, no.

21:54.563 --> 21:56.394
I mean, that... Are you thirsty?

21:57.650 --> 21:58.810
Sure.

22:03.739 --> 22:05.525
Is that magic?

22:05.574 --> 22:06.825
No.

22:07.660 --> 22:10.697
It's soda. Here.

22:18.170 --> 22:21.378
It's like a carnival in a can. (LAUGHS)

22:30.516 --> 22:33.599
So, this is Granny's.
And it's pretty great.

22:34.228 --> 22:35.684
She had some lasagna in the fridge.

22:35.771 --> 22:38.103
It didn't go bad,
so I was able to heat it up.

22:39.942 --> 22:41.933
You really are from another world.

22:42.862 --> 22:44.853
Is that okay?

22:47.116 --> 22:48.777
Yeah, it's great.

22:51.537 --> 22:54.529
So, I thought after dinner
we could watch a movie.

22:57.293 --> 23:00.410
It's easier if I show you on my phone.

23:00.462 --> 23:03.545
The screen's small, but here, look.

23:06.385 --> 23:08.751
If I'd known I was coming,
I would've loaded more.

23:08.804 --> 23:11.136
But I brought Commando
and Harold and Maude.

23:11.223 --> 23:14.715
We'll do Harold and Maude,
it's a good date movie, I think.

23:15.603 --> 23:18.060
A date? What's that?

23:19.273 --> 23:22.231
It's a... Never mind.

23:25.821 --> 23:29.279
Are you courting me?

23:30.743 --> 23:31.983
Maybe.

23:33.203 --> 23:34.192
Oh...

23:35.247 --> 23:36.657
You're sweet.

23:38.292 --> 23:40.157
-But...
-Oh, no.

23:41.295 --> 23:44.913
I just don't think I feel the same way
about you as you do me.

23:45.591 --> 23:47.582
Your father told you what happened,
didn't he?

23:47.676 --> 23:49.928
What? No.

23:50.679 --> 23:54.342
I mean, yes, he did mention he met you,
but no, that's not it.

23:56.518 --> 23:59.134
He doesn't think I'm a hero. Well, I am.

23:59.188 --> 24:01.850
Henry, please.

24:03.192 --> 24:08.357
Listen, I thought we were just spending
time together as friends.

24:09.198 --> 24:13.692
And I liked it better that way. I'm sorry.

24:53.117 --> 24:54.106
(SIGHS)

24:56.412 --> 24:58.778
There we go. That'll do.

25:01.542 --> 25:03.248
Mom, this is genius.

25:03.377 --> 25:06.210
Yeah, when the first curse ended
this Peter guy opened this place.

25:06.255 --> 25:07.244
I wouldn't have known about it,

25:07.339 --> 25:08.328
but it got so many noise complaints.

25:08.424 --> 25:10.210
I guess Peter Peter likes his parties.

25:10.259 --> 25:13.296
Hadn't thought of it till you mentioned
the pumpkins though.

25:16.306 --> 25:18.638
Violet wasn't kidding. Look.

25:19.643 --> 25:21.383
Would you look at that. Come on.

25:23.063 --> 25:24.052
(NEIGHING)

25:25.107 --> 25:26.563
Careful, Henry, I got this.

25:29.445 --> 25:30.434
(NEIGHING)

25:31.321 --> 25:34.313
Mom, I guess you need to step back.
Let me handle this.

25:35.284 --> 25:36.399
I didn't do anything.

25:36.452 --> 25:38.317
You're the Dark One. Now get back.

25:38.412 --> 25:39.777
(NEIGHING)

25:44.626 --> 25:46.082
Henry.

25:46.128 --> 25:48.665
It's okay. I got it.

25:51.425 --> 25:52.790
It's okay, Nicodemus.

25:52.843 --> 25:54.128
Come here, boy.

25:56.472 --> 25:59.305
It's okay, Nicodemus. Come here, boy.
Come here.

25:59.349 --> 26:02.136
Yeah. There you go. Hey.

26:03.812 --> 26:05.427
See? I told you.

26:06.648 --> 26:10.641
Now that you've got your girl's horse,
don't you have a dance to get to?

26:17.785 --> 26:20.197
And now we know why she
didn't want you down here.

26:20.329 --> 26:23.321
Indeed. I don't think she wants
anyone to see this,

26:23.457 --> 26:25.994
and I think I know the reason why.

26:26.126 --> 26:27.286
Take a gander.

26:28.378 --> 26:30.664
Excalibur looks quite familiar.

26:31.673 --> 26:36.667
The dagger.
It's the same design, the same edges.

26:38.055 --> 26:40.341
What the hell does she want with this?

26:40.390 --> 26:43.223
And with Gold. What is she up to?

26:43.352 --> 26:46.219
Well, given our missing memories,
I'd wager whatever it is, it's not good.

26:46.355 --> 26:48.311
Let's take a better look
at the damn thing and find out.

26:48.357 --> 26:49.847
Stop!

26:51.568 --> 26:54.150
Can't believe I'm about to say this,
but it could be booby trapped.

26:54.196 --> 26:55.356
You could get killed.

26:55.405 --> 26:56.815
Oh. I didn't know you cared.

26:57.991 --> 26:59.197
I don't.

26:59.243 --> 27:02.076
But right now, you're useful-ish.

27:04.039 --> 27:06.655
He was here. Rumple was here.

27:06.708 --> 27:10.200
And now he's gone.
Let's try searching the rest of the house.

27:10.295 --> 27:11.831
(CELL PHONE BEEPS)

27:13.048 --> 27:16.836
No time. It's Henry.
She's on her way back.

27:24.059 --> 27:25.924
Hey, what are you doing?

27:35.612 --> 27:37.398
What the hell is that?

27:37.531 --> 27:39.271
It's a dreamcatcher.

27:40.075 --> 27:43.408
Baelfire gave her one
similar to this a long time ago.

27:44.204 --> 27:45.740
But this, it's different.

27:46.373 --> 27:47.579
Yeah, but why would she have it?

27:47.624 --> 27:52.744
Because they can be
more than just objects of folklore.

27:52.796 --> 27:56.254
When imbued with magic,
they can be quite powerful.

27:57.092 --> 28:00.550
I think I know how Emma
took our memories.

28:08.437 --> 28:10.098
REGINA: Go on, Emma. Do it.

28:10.230 --> 28:11.811
Arthur can be here any second.

28:20.449 --> 28:22.940
Now for the final ingredient.

28:22.993 --> 28:24.449
The tear.

28:32.461 --> 28:33.450
(GASPS)

28:34.796 --> 28:36.297
It should've worked.

28:36.423 --> 28:38.334
It should have worked.

28:38.467 --> 28:41.300
Regina, it's simple.

28:41.803 --> 28:43.304
Your heartbreak wasn't strong enough.

28:43.430 --> 28:44.465
(SCOFFS) What?

28:44.514 --> 28:46.766
No, I know it was real.

28:48.185 --> 28:51.473
But there's Robin now.
You've moved on. You've healed.

28:53.315 --> 28:55.681
Hey. Sorry, I'm late.

28:56.652 --> 28:57.767
Henry, are you okay?

28:57.819 --> 28:59.025
Yeah, I'm fine.

28:59.780 --> 29:02.146
No, you're not. What happened?

29:02.282 --> 29:03.271
Henry?

29:03.325 --> 29:05.486
I don't want to talk about it.

29:06.495 --> 29:08.156
You can tell us anything.

29:09.706 --> 29:11.992
I tried doing what you said.

29:12.042 --> 29:14.829
I tried acting like myself.

29:17.673 --> 29:19.959
But she didn't want
anything to do with me.

29:22.302 --> 29:23.337
Henry.

29:25.013 --> 29:26.549
Violet's right.

29:26.682 --> 29:29.674
In this world, I'll never be a hero.

29:31.561 --> 29:35.019
You may not be a hero in her world,

29:35.148 --> 29:37.525
but you will be in ours.

29:38.485 --> 29:40.316
This'll work.

29:40.362 --> 29:41.351
This tear...

29:43.365 --> 29:44.821
Your tear, Henry.

29:45.701 --> 29:47.316
It can free Merlin?

29:47.911 --> 29:49.242
You can save me, kid.

29:54.001 --> 29:55.161
ARTH U R: Stop!

29:57.170 --> 29:58.876
Stay away from the tree.

30:00.507 --> 30:02.213
I won't ask twice.

30:02.259 --> 30:04.170
You and your people
have done nothing but lie to me

Go ahead.
Call me a fraud again, I dare you.

We welcomed you,

30:13.562 --> 30:15.052
celebrated you, and in return,

30:15.188 --> 30:17.565
you bring the Dark One
into the heart of my kingdom.

My great hope.

31:55.705 --> 31:57.866
How you've disappointed me.

31:58.542 --> 32:00.373
I disappointed you?

32:01.336 --> 32:04.544
You gave me false prophecies.

32:04.673 --> 32:08.006
Sent me on an impossible quest.
You ruined my life!

32:08.135 --> 32:09.671
Put it away, Arthur.

32:09.803 --> 32:12.169
We both know
that broken sword can't hurt me.

32:34.369 --> 32:35.870
Well, then we need to
get it back at once.

32:35.912 --> 32:38.494
It would be disastrous if
the Dark One took possession of it.

32:38.540 --> 32:40.531
That have anything to do
with its striking resemblance

32:40.584 --> 32:41.664
to the Dark One dagger?

32:43.670 --> 32:45.001
How do you know about the dagger?

32:45.046 --> 32:48.755
I spent a lifetime trying to end
the Dark One's existence.

32:48.884 --> 32:50.840
I know much about the dagger.

32:50.886 --> 32:54.378
What I don't know about is your blade.

32:55.599 --> 32:57.009
Care to enlighten us?

32:58.059 --> 32:59.560
Yes.

33:00.228 --> 33:01.843
There's a reason
they resemble each other.

33:01.897 --> 33:04.058
They were forged as one weapon.

33:04.191 --> 33:06.933
And then broken in two.
I've spent years trying to reunite them.

33:07.068 --> 33:09.775
That's why you were so interested
in the dagger when you arrived.

33:09.905 --> 33:13.272
I apologize for not telling you sooner,
but I had to make sure I could trust you.

33:13.408 --> 33:16.741
The restored weapon has great power.
It can eradicate all dark magic forever.

33:16.786 --> 33:17.866
That's a good thing.

33:17.913 --> 33:19.073
ARTH U R: Of course.

33:19.122 --> 33:22.034
But in the wrong hands,
it can also destroy all light magic.

33:22.083 --> 33:23.914
That's her plan.

give him something to fight for."

Well, it means
something to you, doesn't it?

you're gonna have to fight me for it.

36:05.538 --> 36:07.745
You weren't thinking
of yourself or the limp.

aren't you?

good reason for what she did.

38:27.722 --> 38:29.337
There. That should do it.

38:35.396 --> 38:37.387
If we would have known
how bad Arthur was,

38:37.440 --> 38:39.055
we never would have
confronted him on our own.

Sure.

But with a caveat.

Darkness like this
takes a hold of the person,

39:24.153 --> 39:27.316
finds its way deep inside
where nobody else can see.

So if I am to free you from its grasp,
I must know one thing.

39:31.953 --> 39:36.617
Emma, is your heart
truly ready to be free?

You know that's not what I mean.

You took our memories and now Gold.
What are you trying to do?

39:56.936 --> 39:57.971
Emma,

39:58.646 --> 40:02.309
there is nothing you can't
come back from if you just tell us.

40:02.442 --> 40:06.435
What I'm doing is my business,
but it's for the best, trust me.

40:06.487 --> 40:08.523
I was starting to.

40:08.656 --> 40:11.819
And like Henry, I was seeing
the good in you, but I was wrong.

40:13.036 --> 40:15.778
I thought you could be different.

40:15.830 --> 40:18.116
I thought you could
escape the darkness.

40:18.166 --> 40:20.782
But then you had to go and rip
a 13-year-old girl's heart out.

40:20.835 --> 40:21.824
What?

40:24.797 --> 40:26.003
Now you're breaking and entering?

40:26.049 --> 40:28.836
Oh, no. You don't get to be
self-righteous with me.

40:28.885 --> 40:30.671
Not after what you've done.

40:31.346 --> 40:33.007
Henry saw what you did.

40:33.848 --> 40:35.054
He was devastated.

40:35.183 --> 40:36.468
I was trying to make it up to him.

40:36.517 --> 40:37.973
Make it up to him?

40:38.019 --> 40:40.226
By reuniting a girl and her horse?

40:40.355 --> 40:41.344
Let me guess.

40:41.481 --> 40:44.393
You let the damn thing out
in the first place.

40:44.525 --> 40:47.517
You forget, I have
some experience with Dark Ones.

40:47.654 --> 40:49.861
Everything's a manipulation.

40:49.906 --> 40:51.066
Well, it would've been fine

40:51.199 --> 40:54.157
if you could've just helped yourself
and stayed out of it.

40:54.202 --> 40:55.533
Maybe you're the one causing pain.

40:55.662 --> 40:56.868
Wow.

40:57.705 --> 41:00.412
Listen to you
trying to justify everything.

41:00.541 --> 41:05.205
If I'm the one on the moral high ground,
you've fallen quite a ways, Ms. Swan.

41:05.254 --> 41:08.041
Don't "Ms. Swan" me,
we've been through too much.

41:09.050 --> 41:12.588
You know I never would've done that
to Henry ifl didn't have good reason.

41:13.221 --> 41:14.552
Good reason?

41:17.183 --> 41:19.174
You know, that's exactly
what my mother said

41:19.227 --> 41:21.388
to justify what she did to Daniel.

41:21.437 --> 41:23.769
What I did in Camelot,
I did to protect Henry.

41:23.898 --> 41:26.389
She thought
she was protecting me, too.

41:26.442 --> 41:27.522
I didn't have a choice.

41:27.568 --> 41:30.856
There's always a choice, Emma.

41:31.364 --> 41:33.400
You've said that to me
a thousand times.

41:33.449 --> 41:35.610
We were running out of time.
It was the only way to free Merlin.

41:36.411 --> 41:37.446
Merlin?

41:39.622 --> 41:41.533
What, we freed Merlin in Camelot?

41:45.586 --> 41:47.622
But if that's true,
why are you still the Dark One?

41:47.755 --> 41:50.087
This is a waste of time.
I want to see my son.
