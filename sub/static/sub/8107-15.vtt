00:20.313 --> 00:21.731
You like that?

00:24.776 --> 00:25.610
I don't know.

00:25.735 --> 00:28.488
You want me
to use my butt again?

00:34.536 --> 00:36.621
I don't know
how I got here.

00:43.628 --> 00:44.713
How many drinks
did I have?

00:44.838 --> 00:47.006
Your scotch hasn't
even arrived yet.

00:47.132 --> 00:49.634
Means I was drunk
when I got here.

00:52.303 --> 00:53.596
8:50.

00:55.306 --> 00:57.475
I remember
being at work.

00:58.226 --> 01:00.645
I've lost at least
four hours.

01:02.856 --> 01:04.232
Say five words.

01:04.357 --> 01:05.650
What do you mean?

01:05.775 --> 01:07.736
That's four words.

01:07.861 --> 01:12.157
The accepted diagnostic test for global
memory impairment is five random words.

01:12.282 --> 01:13.742
Are you okay?

01:13.867 --> 01:19.205
I'm trying to find that out.
Now, give me five animals.

01:19.914 --> 01:22.959
Cat. Bird.

01:23.084 --> 01:27.589
Monkey. Rhino. Goldfish.

01:29.591 --> 01:34.220
Monkey. Rhino...
Either I'm massively drunk...

01:38.391 --> 01:40.101
You're bleeding.

01:40.226 --> 01:41.728
Or it's someone
else's blood.

01:42.771 --> 01:45.023
Can you see a wound?

01:48.651 --> 01:51.321
- How bad is it?
- It's all over.

01:51.446 --> 01:55.200
I have a concussion.
Retrograde amnesia.

01:58.745 --> 02:01.539
No keys, no phone,
I've been mugged.

02:01.664 --> 02:02.832
No, you haven't.

02:03.416 --> 02:04.959
You already
gave me a twenty.

02:05.084 --> 02:05.960
Did you earn it?

02:06.085 --> 02:07.462
Not yet.

02:15.345 --> 02:17.347
Someone is going to die.

02:17.472 --> 02:19.265
- Kenny!
- Not you.

02:20.517 --> 02:22.560
I saw something.
A symptom.

02:24.062 --> 02:26.022
Someone is going to die
unless I find them.

02:26.147 --> 02:27.565
Who?

02:29.609 --> 02:31.194
I have no idea.

02:32.278 --> 02:34.030

I saw somebody dying.

04:13.171 --> 04:15.840
You saw 30 people
flying into glass and metal.

04:15.965 --> 04:18.051
I saw a symptom
before the crash.

04:18.176 --> 04:19.969
You're concussed.
You don't know what you saw

04:20.094 --> 04:21.095
and you don't know
when you saw it.

04:21.220 --> 04:23.681
A week ago,
you noticed a symptom in a soap star.

04:23.806 --> 04:25.600
Bad argument,
since I was right about that.

04:25.725 --> 04:29.312
But your brain obviously thinks it
happened last night. Wires are crossed.

04:29.437 --> 04:33.358
That's all of it. A few stitches
will hold your brain in place.

04:34.901 --> 04:39.030
hold your head still unless you want me
to sew your nose onto your eye.

04:39.489 --> 04:40.782
Why was I taking a bus?

04:40.907 --> 04:42.367
Because you were drunk.

04:42.492 --> 04:46.037
What if I saw someone
and I followed them on from

04:46.162 --> 04:47.580
somewhere in Princeton?

04:48.039 --> 04:49.374
You Okay?

04:49.499 --> 04:50.792
Perfect.

04:51.751 --> 04:53.336
Uh...

04:54.587 --> 04:57.173
You.
Get histories from everyone in here.

04:57.298 --> 04:58.508
Did you just
forget his name?

04:58.633 --> 04:59.884
No.

05:00.551 --> 05:05.014
Lesbian, find out if anybody on that bus
was taken to other hospitals.

05:05.139 --> 05:06.140
You just forgot mine.

05:06.265 --> 05:08.393
No, Thirteen.

05:08.518 --> 05:10.728
- I just wanted to call you a lesbian.
- I'm not a lesbian.

05:10.853 --> 05:15.149
I was rounding up from 50 percent.
Find my cane and motorcycle.

05:15.274 --> 05:18.277
Figure out
where I went last night.

05:18.403 --> 05:21.656
Where's your cane and motorcycle,
and where'd you go last night?

05:21.781 --> 05:24.200
You're gonna trust me?
I lie about everything.

05:24.325 --> 05:27.787
You're staying the night. We need
to monitor your brain for swelling.

05:27.912 --> 05:29.247
How much bigger
could it get?

05:29.372 --> 05:32.667
You don't think it's

05:32.792 --> 05:35.420
a little weird
that there's both a giant crash

05:35.545 --> 05:38.631
and a simultaneous,
mysterious symptom sighting?

05:40.174 --> 05:42.010
What if it's not
a coincidence?

05:42.135 --> 05:45.430
You mean like the hand of God
reaching down and screwing with you?

05:45.555 --> 05:48.808
That, or the symptom
caused the crash.

05:51.978 --> 05:54.814
You see anybody
in a bus driver's uniform?

06:02.405 --> 06:06.034
Right here,
purpura on Lalph Klamden's neck.

06:06.159 --> 06:07.285
Indicative of leukemia.

06:07.410 --> 06:10.496
It caused a bleed in the brain,
hence the accident.

06:10.621 --> 06:14.167
Indicative of wearing a seatbelt.
It's just a bruise.

06:14.292 --> 06:15.251
I have leukemia?

06:15.376 --> 06:16.919
No, we just
ruled that out.

06:17.045 --> 06:19.464
Pay attention.
So he probably had a seizure.

06:19.589 --> 06:23.217
I didn't have a seizure.
I got hit by a garbage truck.

06:23.342 --> 06:24.802
Which you drove into
while you were seizing.

06:24.927 --> 06:27.638
You saw the bus driver exhibiting
the initial stages of a seizure

06:27.764 --> 06:30.516
and didn't bother telling him
to pull over?

06:31.350 --> 06:33.061
Hey!

06:33.186 --> 06:36.481
Nobody leaves here
until I say they can be discharged.

06:36.606 --> 06:38.900
- She said I was...
- Is she me?

06:39.317 --> 06:40.777
You have a fever.

06:40.902 --> 06:42.361
No, I'm fine.

06:42.487 --> 06:43.863
98.6.

06:43.988 --> 06:45.239
I need him to stay.

06:45.364 --> 06:48.159
Pulse is normal, BP's normal,
everything's normal.

06:48.284 --> 06:50.328
I just have a stiff neck
from the crash.

06:50.453 --> 06:52.330
Stiff neck.

06:52.455 --> 06:54.457
This man has meningitis.

06:54.582 --> 06:56.292
We need to quarantine
the whole ER.

06:56.417 --> 07:00.421
No one leaves here
until their full work-up is complete.

07:07.845 --> 07:10.515
KUTNER:
You left here at 5:23 p.m.

07:10.640 --> 07:12.642
Your motorcycle
never made it home.

07:12.767 --> 07:17.855
Well, that covers ten seconds out of
the four hours I can't remember.

07:18.147 --> 07:19.023
Where else
did you look?

07:19.148 --> 07:20.942
We did pull up
a list of all the injuries.

07:21.067 --> 07:22.401
Twenty-two victims
were brought here,

07:22.527 --> 07:25.655
injuries ranging from a broken pelvis
to a severed right foot.

07:25.780 --> 07:28.741
The other eight were taken over
to Princeton General.

07:30.284 --> 07:32.787
Be helpful if these came
with head shots and resumes.

07:32.912 --> 07:36.958
Twenty-something-year-old Jane Doe,
kidney contusion, laceration on her leg.

07:37.083 --> 07:40.002
Both of which
are expected complications

07:40.128 --> 07:43.297
when someone goes from 60 to 0
in no seconds flat.

07:43.422 --> 07:46.134
Weirdest thing we've got
is a ruptured spleen.

07:46.259 --> 07:47.969
Okay, new plan.

07:48.094 --> 07:50.471
We make a list of all the bars
between here and the crash site,

07:50.596 --> 07:51.889
we find out where I went, we go there...

07:52.014 --> 07:53.391
TAUB: On it.

07:56.477 --> 07:58.229
You're not gonna do anything,
are you?

07:58.354 --> 08:00.064
We're gonna go to the ER
and do our jobs.

08:00.189 --> 08:02.525
Someone is dying
because I can't remember...

08:02.650 --> 08:04.986
When you remember,
you can page us.

08:07.572 --> 08:10.074
The shortest distance
between here and your memory

08:10.199 --> 08:13.703
is straight through your pre-frontal
cortex. All we have to do is access it.

08:13.828 --> 08:16.455
Great idea.
I'll build the giant submarine,

08:16.581 --> 08:18.040
you get
the miniaturization gizmo.

08:18.166 --> 08:21.586
Medical hypnosis can bring the brain
to a Class 2 Theta state,

08:21.711 --> 08:23.754
increasing focus
and memory retrieval.

08:23.880 --> 08:26.132
You're not gonna make me
do the chicken dance, are you?

08:26.257 --> 08:28.885
Someone in the surgical department
must be trained.

08:29.010 --> 08:33.181
Just relax. Keep letting go
of any intrusive thoughts.

08:33.306 --> 08:34.390
(EXHALES)

08:35.808 --> 08:38.603
So what? You saw an ad
on the back of a comic book?

08:38.728 --> 08:41.147
I did a rotation
in Melbourne.

08:42.023 --> 08:43.524
Focus on the sound
of your breath.

08:43.649 --> 08:45.651
You're taxing
an already injured brain.

08:45.776 --> 08:48.362
It's like telling him to walk it off
after a broken ankle.

08:48.487 --> 08:50.406
Wilson is done talking now.

08:54.952 --> 08:56.913
Visualize the bus.

08:57.038 --> 08:58.706
The way it looked.

08:58.831 --> 09:00.458
The way it smelled.

09:00.583 --> 09:04.253
The people on it.
What they look like.

09:06.631 --> 09:09.759
This is a waste of

09:10.718 --> 09:12.136
time.

09:17.183 --> 09:18.935
Cool.

09:20.853 --> 09:22.730
Focus on the details.

09:23.522 --> 09:24.815
The bus is empty.

09:28.110 --> 09:29.695
Is this really working?

09:29.820 --> 09:34.825
Just focus. Clear your mind.
Think back to how you felt.

09:34.951 --> 09:36.744
Details you saw.

09:39.914 --> 09:42.708
I can't see
out the windows.

09:43.459 --> 09:45.294
And I can
see you guys.

09:46.212 --> 09:48.631
Memories further from the incident
should be clearer.

09:48.756 --> 09:50.967
Where were you
before you got on the bus?

10:02.520 --> 10:05.856
WILSON: Why'd you get so drunk
at 5:00 in the afternoon, alone?

10:07.149 --> 10:09.443
I need a reason?

10:09.568 --> 10:11.779
God, I hate
"Beer" brand beer.

10:11.904 --> 10:13.656
When he's hypnotized,
can he lie?

10:13.781 --> 10:15.574
- He...
- I could be mistaken,

10:15.700 --> 10:18.035
but I can't actually lie under hypnosis.

10:18.160 --> 10:19.704
- Is he lying?
- No.

10:19.829 --> 10:20.997
What are you
running away from?

10:21.122 --> 10:24.458
When I'm drinking, without you,
what am I running away from?

10:24.583 --> 10:27.670
One of those imponderables.
Can we hold off on your insecurities

10:27.795 --> 10:29.171
until we find
this patient?

10:29.297 --> 10:31.674
Do you see anyone
in the bar?

10:33.551 --> 10:39.181
I see a faceless crowd. How do I focus?
Say something to make me focus.

10:39.307 --> 10:43.019
He's concerned about you.
Why does that mean he's insecure?

10:44.437 --> 10:46.105
Get your girlfriend
out of here.

10:46.230 --> 10:48.566
- It's a legit question.
- Amber's there?

10:48.691 --> 10:49.984
You've got Amber
in your head?

10:50.109 --> 10:51.485
You put her
in my head.

10:51.944 --> 10:54.155
I can't even have a conversation
with you in my subconscious

10:54.280 --> 10:55.531
without her
tagging along.

10:55.656 --> 10:57.325
She'd better have
her clothes on.

10:57.450 --> 10:58.909
(SIGHS) Unfortunately.

11:01.662 --> 11:02.997
I didn't mean
to say that out loud.

11:03.122 --> 11:04.040
Say what out loud?

11:04.165 --> 11:06.083
I didn't say it
out loud?

11:07.209 --> 11:08.044
Nothing.

11:08.169 --> 11:09.962
What's going
on in there?

11:10.087 --> 11:12.798
If I can't lie,
I need these two out of here.

11:12.923 --> 11:17.303
Let's just ignore Wilson and Amber
from now on, shall we?

11:17.428 --> 11:19.347
I wish it were that...

11:24.226 --> 11:28.356
That's some program they've
got down there in Melbourne. Cheers.

11:30.191 --> 11:31.859
- I remember the bartender.
- Good.

11:32.234 --> 11:34.653
Now you're accessing
your temporal lobe.

11:34.779 --> 11:37.823
Does the bartender
have any odd symptoms?

11:38.532 --> 11:40.451
No, he seems fine.

11:41.243 --> 11:44.413
Is anybody here sick?
Anyone here taking the bus?

11:44.538 --> 11:45.623
You are.

11:47.208 --> 11:49.543
Because you took
my keys.

11:49.668 --> 11:53.589
CHASE: Good. This is good.
Now we can retrace your steps.

11:54.590 --> 11:56.217
Let's go back
to the bus.

11:56.675 --> 11:59.261
- What's in front of you?
- Passengers.

11:59.804 --> 12:02.723
Anything special
about them?

12:07.228 --> 12:09.063
(COUGHING)

12:11.816 --> 12:15.111
Some Emo guitar hero wannabe.

12:15.236 --> 12:17.738
You're focusing on him.
Why?

12:17.863 --> 12:20.991
Because nose picking
could mean nasal pruritus.

12:21.117 --> 12:22.451
He's dying-

12:23.577 --> 12:25.579
- You a nose picker?
- Do I have to answer...

12:25.704 --> 12:27.039
If the answer was no,
you would have answered.

12:27.164 --> 12:28.040
Tilt your head back.

12:28.165 --> 12:29.291
He's fine.

12:29.417 --> 12:30.793
Doesn't even
have meningitis.

12:30.918 --> 12:34.004
Just like everybody else
we've had to give meningitis shots to.

12:34.130 --> 12:35.297
You can go.

12:35.423 --> 12:36.757
You have
a brain tumor.

12:39.009 --> 12:40.010
You're kidding, right?

12:40.136 --> 12:41.887
If I was kidding,
I'd be dressed like you.

12:42.012 --> 12:44.849
You're fine.
A nurse will sign you out.

12:45.349 --> 12:49.103
Go home, have fun, relax.
I'm probably just a nut case.

12:54.650 --> 12:55.985
Tilt your head back.

13:07.455 --> 13:09.457
Get your things and go.

13:10.458 --> 13:13.461
You need to rest.
I'm admitting you.

13:18.048 --> 13:19.675
(SCREAMING)

13:21.469 --> 13:22.970
I can't gel "P!

13:23.095 --> 13:25.097
I can't move my legs!

13:29.727 --> 13:32.229
Your legs are not
your biggest problem.

13:32.354 --> 13:36.692
Your biggest problem is I don't know
what your biggest problem is.

13:42.281 --> 13:44.700
HOUSE: So, we have the who
but not the what.

13:44.825 --> 13:46.702
We've only got
one symptom to go on.

13:46.827 --> 13:48.454
Sudden onset paralysis.

13:48.579 --> 13:49.914
We actually
have two symptoms.

13:50.039 --> 13:51.290
Only one
that we remember.

13:51.415 --> 13:53.125
You did a full work-up
on the guy.

13:53.250 --> 13:55.669
- Did you find anything?
- CT ruled out subdural hematoma,

13:55.794 --> 13:57.421
stroke,
or subarachnoid hemorrhage.

13:57.546 --> 13:59.548
Guillain-Barre fits.

14:02.051 --> 14:04.261
Just trying to figure out
what Guillain-Barré looks like.

14:04.386 --> 14:05.804
You can't just
eliminate everything

14:05.930 --> 14:07.806
because it doesn't match
what you might have seen.

14:07.932 --> 14:10.017
How about because it doesn't match
what I could have seen?

14:10.142 --> 14:13.354
Guillain-Barré has no external
physical manifestations.

14:13.479 --> 14:16.607
Everything has some external
physical manifestations.

14:16.732 --> 14:18.567
And you're obsessive enough
to notice any of them.

14:18.692 --> 14:19.860
Which means there's nothing
we can rule out.

14:19.985 --> 14:22.571
Elevated white count.
Means transverse myelitis...

14:22.696 --> 14:24.448
Sudden paralysis
while driving a bus.

14:24.573 --> 14:27.660
That's the sort of subtle clue
that only a genius would have noticed.

14:35.626 --> 14:36.752
(SNIFFING)

14:40.673 --> 14:43.425
Are you sure
you're feeling okay?

14:43.926 --> 14:45.886
Where are you going?

14:46.011 --> 14:48.514
To smell a bus.
Obviously.

14:51.642 --> 14:56.105
Yeah, I'll start him on antibiotics
in case it's transverse myelitis.

14:56.939 --> 15:00.109
You guys go sniff
a city bus.

15:04.780 --> 15:06.740
Why are you smelling
the passengers' clothes?

15:06.865 --> 15:11.453
Smell is the most powerful
evokerater of memory.

15:12.288 --> 15:13.581
I need to get
back on that bus.

15:13.706 --> 15:16.125
Okay.
So why are you taking so much Vicodin?

15:16.250 --> 15:19.878
If Cuddy asks, blocking the pain
helps focus the memory.

15:20.004 --> 15:23.299
You split your head open.
You should rest.

15:25.759 --> 15:27.219
- Anything?
- Hint of

15:29.680 --> 15:31.307
exploded bus.

15:33.100 --> 15:36.854
House, that's four Vicodin
in forty seconds. At this rate...

15:36.979 --> 15:38.397
Wish me luck.

15:40.524 --> 15:42.401
I'm going in,
Rambo style.

15:43.819 --> 15:46.864
House, do you think this is gonna work,
or are you just stoned?

15:50.159 --> 15:51.660
Both, apparently.

15:53.412 --> 15:55.789
You're wrong.
It's not working.

15:55.914 --> 15:57.124
So you're saying
I'm not here?

15:57.249 --> 15:59.251
If it was a real memory,
you'd be limping

15:59.376 --> 16:00.753
and you wouldn't be talking to me.

16:00.878 --> 16:03.005
I'm obviously
a hallucination.

16:04.048 --> 16:06.133
Okay, so I went a little heavy
on the Vicodin.

16:06.258 --> 16:09.720
Better hope so. 'Cause otherwise,
means your brain's bleeding.

16:09.845 --> 16:13.057
We're both in my head. You'd think
one of us would have noticed the blood.

16:13.182 --> 16:14.642
Why haven't you
had a head CT yet?

16:14.767 --> 16:17.728
Who do you want me to treat?
Me or you? Did you have a seizure?

16:17.853 --> 16:21.315
Dumb question. The brain's too fried
during a seizure to form memories.

16:21.440 --> 16:23.984
Dumb answer.
I wasn't asking you, I was asking me,

16:24.109 --> 16:25.653
because you've already proven
that you're not here.

16:25.778 --> 16:27.363
- I'm getting a headache.
- Is that a clue?

16:27.488 --> 16:30.240
Again, I'm not here.
You're getting a headache.

16:30.366 --> 16:33.911
Stop arguing with a hallucination
and get some treatment.

16:34.036 --> 16:35.412
WOMAN: He can't.

16:37.373 --> 16:42.127
The hallucination is your messed-up
brain's way of reasoning out a problem.

16:42.252 --> 16:44.630
You weren't on the bus.

16:44.755 --> 16:46.256
How do you know?

16:46.382 --> 16:50.761
Five-hundred-dollar shoes?
Not on the Princeton cross-town.

16:50.886 --> 16:52.721
Must be another reason
why I'm here.

16:53.514 --> 16:56.517
Yes.
What do you have to tell me?

16:59.395 --> 17:02.022
I was talking
to the passengers on the bus.

17:02.147 --> 17:05.192
You were hallucinating.
You're getting an MRI.

17:08.445 --> 17:10.155
<i>WILSON: Stop fidgeting.</i>

17:12.282 --> 17:14.368
If you haven't found the bleed yet,
it can't be...

17:14.493 --> 17:17.621
There's edema and localized swelling
in the section of the temporal lobe

17:17.746 --> 17:19.498
that controls
short-term memory.

17:19.623 --> 17:22.876
<i>Also, the penis size cortex
is set to "pathetic."</i>

17:23.252 --> 17:25.295
What didn't you
say out loud?

17:25.421 --> 17:26.547
Very little.

17:26.672 --> 17:28.382
<i>When you were
under hypnosis,</i>

17:28.757 --> 17:30.467
you were talking to Amber.

17:32.261 --> 17:34.304
I wanted to
see her naked.

17:35.097 --> 17:36.974
Seriously,
what were you hiding?

17:37.099 --> 17:38.350
I want to see
her naked.

17:38.475 --> 17:40.769
You want to see everyone naked.
Why would you hide that?

17:41.770 --> 17:45.190
Some guys get upset
when you objectify their girlfriends.

17:45.315 --> 17:48.861
But if you're okay, I got
a digital video camera, so we could...

17:48.986 --> 17:50.654
<i>Why would I be upset
that you're treating my girlfriend</i>

17:50.779 --> 17:52.823
<i>like you treat every other woman
on the planet?</i>

17:53.824 --> 17:57.035
Unless you're not.

17:58.036 --> 17:59.830
<i>Unless it's deeper
than that.</i>

18:01.415 --> 18:03.667
You weren't
objectifying her.

18:04.668 --> 18:10.090
Trust me, I want to do some very nasty,
demeaning stuff to your girlfriend.

18:11.049 --> 18:13.927
You have feelings for her.

18:16.513 --> 18:18.348
This is bad.

18:20.434 --> 18:22.603
It's a longitudinal fracture
of the temporal bone.

18:22.728 --> 18:24.313
I banged my head.

18:24.438 --> 18:26.315
This isn't
just a boo-boo.

18:26.440 --> 18:29.026
I'll rest once I figure out
what's wrong with this guy.

18:29.151 --> 18:31.445
Why?
Why this guy?

18:31.570 --> 18:33.572
You want patients with weird,
undiagnosed symptoms?

18:33.697 --> 18:36.658
You get five files like that
on your desk every morning.

18:36.784 --> 18:39.453
And you'd never risk
your life for them.

18:39.828 --> 18:43.499
Why is this guy so special that
all of a sudden you've become Batman?

18:44.875 --> 18:45.709
I don't know.

18:45.834 --> 18:49.505
Maybe it's because you have
a cracked skull and you're not yourself.

18:49.630 --> 18:51.673
Go home,
go to sleep.

19:28.836 --> 19:30.295
(GROANS)

19:32.422 --> 19:33.507
My legs are holding.

19:33.632 --> 19:36.385
Good. Now put all your weight
on your right leg.

19:36.510 --> 19:38.136
(DOOR OPENS)

19:38.262 --> 19:40.013
The antibiotics are working.
It's TM.

19:40.138 --> 19:41.223
FOREMAN:
It's 2:00 in the morning.

19:41.348 --> 19:43.767
You should be home resting
what's left of your bruised brain.

19:43.892 --> 19:45.269
Recovery's too fast.

19:45.394 --> 19:47.437
What, the fact that he's getting better
is evidence that we're wrong?

19:47.563 --> 19:48.397
(GROANING)

19:48.522 --> 19:50.274
I need to sit.

19:50.399 --> 19:52.359
Recovery slow
enough for you now?

19:52.484 --> 19:54.528
It's my stomach.

19:54.653 --> 19:56.446
Which means it's
not transverse myelitis.

19:56.572 --> 19:58.532
Rapid onset,
could be a perforated ulcer.

19:58.657 --> 20:01.076
Wouldn't explain
the paralysis.

20:01.201 --> 20:03.370
Addison's.
From a tumor.

20:03.871 --> 20:05.831
It's possible that
I saw his eyelids droop.

20:05.956 --> 20:08.417
We've scanned his head
five times.

20:09.960 --> 20:11.086
You're bleeding.

20:11.211 --> 20:12.546
Little thing called
a bus crash.

20:12.671 --> 20:15.924
Just a scalp laceration. It could
be hidden in his optic chiasm.

20:16.049 --> 20:18.135
It's coming
from your ear.

20:18.260 --> 20:19.720
Think that's
a good thing?

20:19.845 --> 20:22.848
But that would have
affected his eyesight.

20:24.182 --> 20:26.059
I need to take a bath.

20:27.311 --> 20:30.689
Hallucinations and smells were
kind of working, right? Why the bath?

20:30.814 --> 20:34.860
Hypnosis gave me the nose picker.
Smells set off hallucinations.

20:35.402 --> 20:39.656
Sensory deprivation should get the brain
into an alpha-theta phase.

20:39.781 --> 20:41.241
Didn't you see
Altered States?

20:41.366 --> 20:43.785
I don't think I was even born
when that movie was out.

20:43.911 --> 20:47.122
Then you're too young to be a doctor.
That movie was released in 1980.

20:47.247 --> 20:48.415
That was 28 years ago.

20:48.540 --> 20:49.875
No it wasn't. Shut up.

20:50.000 --> 20:52.461
Did you just forget
what year it is?

20:52.586 --> 20:54.838
No, I just remembered
how old I am.

20:56.423 --> 20:58.967
I need to give my brain
time to transition

20:59.092 --> 21:00.802
so I can embrace my inner monkey.

21:00.928 --> 21:03.597
Or maybe I don't.
Get me some physostigmine.

21:03.722 --> 21:04.973
It crosses
the blood-brain barrier.

21:05.098 --> 21:06.642
And act like a nerve gas,
stop your heart,

21:06.767 --> 21:10.812
you'll go to heaven and be omniscient.
Good idea. Not gonna happen.

21:10.938 --> 21:15.984
Don't do anything. Even if I escape,
eat a goat or get shot by police.

21:16.109 --> 21:19.279
"Wasn't born yet" means I won't
be entertained by further reference.

21:28.789 --> 21:31.166
I didn't know
you rode the bus.

21:31.291 --> 21:36.546
I used to drive home after getting
drunk, but some mothers got mad-d.

21:37.255 --> 21:40.634
What are you doing here?
You weren't on the bus with me.

21:40.759 --> 21:45.347
Then I guess this isn't a memory.
It's a fantasy.

21:45.806 --> 21:49.768
If it's a fantasy,
you'd be wearing this.

21:53.814 --> 21:54.982
You're convinced
your patient is dying

21:55.107 --> 21:57.401
and you wanna waste your time
with a sex fantasy?

21:57.526 --> 21:59.403
Don't blame me,
blame my gender.

21:59.528 --> 22:00.862
Well, I'm not here
to indulge that.

22:00.988 --> 22:02.948
I'm here to help you figure out
what symptom you saw.

22:03.073 --> 22:04.825
Your patient was driving the bus,
so all you could see...

22:04.950 --> 22:06.743
Why can't you do both?

22:07.577 --> 22:09.830
<i>(DANCE MUSIC PLAYING)</i>

22:15.002 --> 22:19.589
Your patient was driving the bus, so
all you could see was him sitting down,

22:19.715 --> 22:21.800
most likely
facing forward.

22:28.598 --> 22:34.646
From behind I saw his earlobes wiggling,
or his head bobbing.

22:42.279 --> 22:44.406
But not that.

22:44.531 --> 22:46.241
Could indicate
aortic insufficiency.

22:47.826 --> 22:49.870
- Marfan's syndrome.
- Or syphilis.

22:55.083 --> 22:58.045
What if his earlobes
were just drooping?

22:58.170 --> 22:59.421
Ehlers-Danlos?

22:59.546 --> 23:01.798
Or Cutis Laxa.

23:01.923 --> 23:03.216
It's not fatal
in adults.

23:08.597 --> 23:11.767
Yes, he's an adult,
very good point, keep going.

23:17.397 --> 23:19.608
I'm distracting you.

23:19.733 --> 23:21.234
No!

23:23.070 --> 23:24.154
Dance, woman.

23:24.279 --> 23:25.614
You'd rather
be diagnosing.

23:25.739 --> 23:27.574
I screamed no.

23:27.699 --> 23:30.160
And your own subconscious
ignored you.

23:30.285 --> 23:33.371
Because you'd rather fantasize
about finding symptoms.

23:33.497 --> 23:35.791
How screwed up
is that?

23:35.916 --> 23:38.627
Hey, over here.
Remember me?

23:39.753 --> 23:41.463
I'm the sick guy.

23:42.214 --> 23:43.673
Tell me what I saw.

23:43.799 --> 23:46.802
Was it the blood
dripping from my ear?

23:49.096 --> 23:53.266
That doesn't make sense
because your shirt wasn't stained.

23:54.101 --> 23:56.103
And because
that was me.

23:59.147 --> 24:01.525
I could have had a subtle hemiballismus,

24:01.650 --> 24:03.652
indicating
the early stages of Huntington's.

24:03.777 --> 24:06.279
Huntington's wouldn't explain
the abdominal pain,

24:06.404 --> 24:08.573
and it's only on the table
because we're thinking of Thirteen.

24:08.698 --> 24:11.660
A shuffling gait
could suggest Parkinson's.

24:11.785 --> 24:13.870
Except there's no such thing as
"shuffling sitting."

24:13.995 --> 24:17.374
He moved when he helped
the old lady up the steps.

24:20.085 --> 24:21.128
Who are you?

24:21.253 --> 24:24.881
I'm the answer.
Look.

24:25.841 --> 24:26.800
At what?

24:27.300 --> 24:28.301

24:43.108 --> 24:44.734
You were right.

24:49.281 --> 24:51.533
Help him up.

24:51.658 --> 24:53.160
I got it,
it's Parkinson's.

24:53.285 --> 24:54.369

24:54.494 --> 24:55.453
Start him on levodopa.

24:55.579 --> 24:57.080
You should sit down.

24:57.205 --> 24:58.748
House!

25:12.929 --> 25:15.140
Get that out
of my face.

25:15.515 --> 25:17.767
Welcome back.
I'm Nurse Dickerson.

25:17.893 --> 25:19.102
I don't need your name.

25:19.227 --> 25:22.022

from your super competent technique

25:22.147 --> 25:23.398
of melting my retinas.

25:23.523 --> 25:27.277
Verbal faculties seem to be intact.
Do you remember passing out?

25:27.402 --> 25:29.988
I remember puking
on Cuddy's shoes.

25:30.989 --> 25:33.325
Yeah, skull fractures
tend to hurt.

25:33.450 --> 25:36.578
Would hurt a lot less
if you hadn't swiped my pain pills.

25:36.703 --> 25:38.872
Dr. Cuddy's orders.
Wants me to regulate the amount of...

25:38.997 --> 25:41.208
Wait a second.
You brought muscle?

25:41.333 --> 25:42.751
Dr. Cuddy's orders.

25:45.629 --> 25:50.550
Means I was wrong.
My patient doesn't have Parkinson's.

25:51.593 --> 25:53.720
Cuddy knows that's the only reason
I wouldn't want to stay here

25:53.845 --> 25:56.640
with my pain pills,
porn and you forever.

25:57.432 --> 26:00.852
Vomiting means
your brain injury is getting worse.

26:01.686 --> 26:04.189

all the way down to his ear canal.

26:04.314 --> 26:07.192

Our other patient has jaundice,

- low albumin and no diagnosis.
- Wilson's Disease.

26:09.736 --> 26:11.321
Thank you.
But Wilson's wouldn't explain...

26:11.446 --> 26:12.906
(TELEPHONE RINGING)

26:15.408 --> 26:17.369
- Foreman.
- How did you eliminate Parkinson's?

26:17.494 --> 26:20.163
Tests confirm the abdominal pain
was caused by liver failure.

26:20.288 --> 26:23.041
I assume you've already ruled out
hepatitis and Wilson's.

26:23.166 --> 26:24.668
You should really
be resting.

26:24.793 --> 26:26.878
Give him five minutes.

Then it hit his spine,

31:42.986 --> 31:45.238

31:45.822 --> 31:49.742
there's some detail I'm not noticing
that's spoiling the big picture.

31:58.334 --> 32:03.756

just going in a different direction now?

or a drug-induced trip to Wonderland.

33:20.625 --> 33:22.960
So the bus driver with the air bubble
was just a coincidence.

33:23.086 --> 33:26.255
No. I got the causation flipped.
The bubble didn't cause the crash.

33:26.381 --> 33:28.508
The crash caused
the bubble to dislodge.

33:28.633 --> 33:30.927
