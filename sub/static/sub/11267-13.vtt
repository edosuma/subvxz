90210 #413 "Should Old
Acquaintance Be Forgot?"
Closed captioned

00:02.210 --> 00:02.961
Previously on 90210:

00:03.086 --> 00:03.754
You took my house,

00:03.879 --> 00:05.840
you took my ex-boyfriend,
you took my internship,

00:05.965 --> 00:07.842
and now you've taken
my mother's affection.

00:07.967 --> 00:09.092
Get your own life
and stop stealing mine.

00:10.093 --> 00:13.597
Oh, my God.

00:13.722 --> 00:14.849
ADRIANNA:
You know that song of mine

00:14.974 --> 00:16.015
that you sampled?
Yeah.

00:16.140 --> 00:18.477
It's about my daughter, Maisy.

00:18.602 --> 00:20.145
Do you know it's been
almost three years

00:20.270 --> 00:21.814
since I gave her away?

00:21.939 --> 00:24.107
You need help. Your father and I
used to do business together.

00:24.232 --> 00:25.567
The business you were in
with my father

00:25.693 --> 00:27.486
was porn, and it almost
destroyed my family.

00:27.611 --> 00:28.487
You'll be wired,
just like in Vegas.

00:28.612 --> 00:29.822
As soon as you
record the proof

00:29.947 --> 00:32.491
that Amal is selling the cars
over state lines,

00:32.616 --> 00:34.242
get the hell out.
Got it.

00:34.368 --> 00:36.411
Who are you working for?

00:36.537 --> 00:37.621
No, I can explain, okay?

00:37.746 --> 00:39.289
(grunting and groaning)

00:39.414 --> 00:40.624
I want to be with you.

00:40.749 --> 00:41.375
Even though I have a kid?

00:41.500 --> 00:42.960
LEILA:
Annie met Patrick

00:43.084 --> 00:46.045
because he hired her
to be his escort.

00:46.171 --> 00:46.588
I got to stop her.

00:48.590 --> 00:50.009
(tires squealing)

00:52.344 --> 00:53.679
(gasps)

00:58.225 --> 00:59.852
Yes, help, please.

00:59.977 --> 01:01.562
There's been an accident.

01:01.687 --> 01:03.313
It was a hit-and-run.

01:09.361 --> 01:11.112
NAOMI:
Hi, you guys!

01:11.238 --> 01:14.491
Bienvenue au les Etats-Unis.
(laughs)

01:14.616 --> 01:16.660
(smacking lips)
Wait. What?

01:16.785 --> 01:19.538
It is French for,
"Welcome to the United States."

01:19.663 --> 01:20.539
Were you not paying
any attention

01:20.664 --> 01:20.915
while you
were in France?

01:21.040 --> 01:22.708
Yes, I did.

01:22.833 --> 01:25.836
Uh, ou est le hamburger,
uh, américain?

01:25.961 --> 01:27.046
I'm starving.

01:27.170 --> 01:28.797
(all laughing)

01:28.923 --> 01:30.089
Okay.

01:30.215 --> 01:31.216
You look fantastic.

01:31.341 --> 01:32.551
Who do you think you are, me?

01:32.676 --> 01:33.802
(chuckles)
Well, the ensemble

01:33.928 --> 01:35.637
is all part of a plan.

01:35.763 --> 01:38.097
Now that everything is finally
settled with the inheritance,

01:38.223 --> 01:40.893
my resolution is:
"New Year, new Annie."

01:41.018 --> 01:42.394
New Annie?

01:42.519 --> 01:43.938
Will the new Annie
be attending

01:44.063 --> 01:44.980
Carnegie Mellon this semester

01:45.146 --> 01:46.481
now that you can afford it?

01:46.607 --> 01:49.192
Or is something
keeping you here-- someone?

01:49.317 --> 01:50.903
How is he?

01:51.028 --> 01:52.153
The same as he's been

01:52.279 --> 01:53.488
every single time
you called me from Paris.

01:53.614 --> 01:55.115
Liam's fine,
and he's getting released

01:55.240 --> 01:56.324
from the hospital today.

01:56.450 --> 01:59.620
It was just so awful
hearing about the accident

01:59.745 --> 02:01.413
from 6,000 miles
away, you know.

02:01.538 --> 02:02.915
Yeah.

02:03.040 --> 02:04.583
Maybe I should have
come home sooner.

02:04.708 --> 02:06.794
Are you kidding?
You were in Paree.

02:06.919 --> 02:08.377
Well, I should go and see him.

02:08.502 --> 02:09.545
Maybe, once I know if we are

02:09.670 --> 02:11.799
going to get
back together or not,

02:11.924 --> 02:12.716
then I can decide about school.

02:12.841 --> 02:15.844
If you do decide to go,
I will be very sad,

02:15.970 --> 02:17.805
but it will
give me an excuse

02:17.930 --> 02:19.807
to throw a big, fat,
fabulous going-away party.

02:19.932 --> 02:21.058
(chuckling)

02:21.182 --> 02:22.559
I did not attend
one soirée

02:22.684 --> 02:24.061
this entire
holiday season.

02:24.185 --> 02:27.064
Did Austin cheating on you
have anything to do with that?

02:27.188 --> 02:29.357
No, no, no, I...
I was really busy with work.

02:29.483 --> 02:31.568
Mm. So you guys are just...
Over.

02:31.693 --> 02:34.071
Yeah. He gave me
some lame excuse, like,

02:34.195 --> 02:35.823
Holly tried to ambush him

02:35.948 --> 02:37.658
while he got out of the shower
or something. No.

02:37.783 --> 02:39.660
No. Whatever.

02:39.785 --> 02:42.746
It's not like I wanted to be
stuck in a relationship anyway.

02:42.871 --> 02:44.623
Oh, there's Ivy.
Chop-chop, honey.

02:44.748 --> 02:45.373
I got to get
to the office.

02:45.499 --> 02:46.416
Sorry. We actually
got held up

02:46.541 --> 02:47.918
at Customs
'cause they thought

02:48.043 --> 02:50.587
that Nick's beef jerky
was black-market monkey meat.

02:50.712 --> 02:52.840
Oh...
I'm going to
get out of here

02:52.965 --> 02:54.842
before they confiscate
something else.
Okay.

02:54.967 --> 02:56.093
Call you later?

02:56.217 --> 02:57.636
Yeah.

02:59.304 --> 03:01.849
Ivy, you're glowing.

03:01.974 --> 03:02.599
IVY:
Yeah, because
I've been camping

03:02.724 --> 03:04.559
under the stars
in New Guinea, guys.

03:06.103 --> 03:07.270
Okay, you know what?
I'm thirsty.

03:07.395 --> 03:09.106
I'm going to get a drink
of water.

03:09.230 --> 03:10.899
I'll meet you at the car?
NAOMI:
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

03:11.025 --> 03:12.151
Okay.

03:12.275 --> 03:13.777
Um, New Guinea
or New Booty?

03:13.902 --> 03:16.195
Uh, yeah.
Seriously, did you see

03:16.321 --> 03:17.614
the way the two of them
were looking at each other?

03:20.408 --> 03:21.827
(laughing)
Come here.

03:21.952 --> 03:24.038
Mmm.

03:24.163 --> 03:26.289
I missed you.
I missed you more.

03:27.582 --> 03:29.126
Dix! Welcome back, man.

03:29.250 --> 03:31.545
I didn't think I'd be seeing you
till I got home.

03:31.670 --> 03:33.380
Well, you know,
I had to see my girl,

03:33.505 --> 03:34.840
so I came straight
from the airport.

03:34.965 --> 03:36.257
(chuckling)
You look like you

03:36.383 --> 03:37.342
came straight
from mime camp.

03:37.467 --> 03:38.552
What are you wearing?

03:38.677 --> 03:40.971
Annie actually decided
to spread the wealth

03:41.096 --> 03:43.473
all over Paris,
so, uh, right now, I'm...

03:43.598 --> 03:46.185
kind of like the black
Criss Angel.

03:46.309 --> 03:47.769
ADRIANNA:
You know, we could totally
wear this onstage.

03:47.895 --> 03:49.938
I've been sending out my
feelers for our first gig,

03:50.064 --> 03:51.773
and the only place
to respond back

03:51.899 --> 03:53.483
was this really weird
Goth club downtown.

03:53.608 --> 03:54.902
DIXON:
You know what?

03:55.027 --> 03:55.610
Let's-let's just
keep looking, okay?

03:55.736 --> 03:57.946
I want to bring this year in
with a bang.

03:58.072 --> 03:59.156
Oh, so do I.

03:59.280 --> 04:01.700
Except Naomi
still won't call me back.

04:01.825 --> 04:03.284
Dude, do you actually think
that she would?

04:03.410 --> 04:04.411
You cheated on her.

04:04.536 --> 04:05.662
No, I didn't, okay?

04:05.787 --> 04:07.497
Holly snuck in and attacked me.

04:07.622 --> 04:09.624
Naomi walked in
before I could push her away.

04:09.750 --> 04:11.877
How hard is it to push away
a 90-pound girl?

04:12.002 --> 04:12.711
Why would I
just start making out

04:12.836 --> 04:14.421
with a girl who randomly
walks into my room.

04:14.546 --> 04:16.048
No offense, but
that's exactly

04:16.173 --> 04:17.591
what you did with
me, cowpoke.

04:19.259 --> 04:20.719
She thinks I milk
the cowboy thing.

04:20.844 --> 04:21.636
ADRIANNA:
Because he does.

04:21.762 --> 04:23.680
You totally do.

04:23.805 --> 04:24.514
So you guys
have been hanging out

04:24.639 --> 04:26.558
quite a bit
since I've been gone, huh?

04:26.683 --> 04:28.185
Don't get jealous, Criss.

04:28.309 --> 04:29.186
Somebody had
to fend off

04:29.310 --> 04:30.395
all the drunk idiots
while you were away.

04:30.520 --> 04:32.022
And that was
different with you.

04:32.147 --> 04:33.815
I wasn't in a relationship.

04:33.941 --> 04:36.235
Okay, well, I hate to
break it to you, "pardner,"

04:36.359 --> 04:37.736
but I don't think
you're really

04:37.861 --> 04:39.696
in a relationship
now, either.

04:42.032 --> 04:43.784
Thanks.

04:43.909 --> 04:45.368
Hey, you.
Hey!

04:47.913 --> 04:49.206
Mmm.

04:49.330 --> 04:50.958
It's great to spend time
with my daughter,

04:51.083 --> 04:52.375
but I wish that didn't mean
time away from you.

04:52.500 --> 04:55.087
Oh, no, please, I understand.

04:55.212 --> 04:58.381
Holidays are for family.

04:58.506 --> 04:59.758
Try explaining
to a three-year-old

04:59.883 --> 05:01.885
that Santa knows to stop at both
Daddy's house and Mommy's condo.

05:02.010 --> 05:04.012
Yikes.

05:04.138 --> 05:07.390
Well, between all my friends
either working or traveling

05:07.515 --> 05:08.934
and visiting Liam
in the hospital,

05:09.059 --> 05:11.394
my holidays were not
exactly perfect, either.

05:11.519 --> 05:14.064
In fact, the only thing that has
felt seasonal around here

05:14.189 --> 05:15.523
is how cold it's been.

05:15.649 --> 05:17.651
Right?

05:18.986 --> 05:20.737
Um...

05:20.862 --> 05:21.863
this is Navid's sweater.

05:21.989 --> 05:23.615
He must have left it at my place

05:23.740 --> 05:25.117
when he was moving out.
Is that weird?

05:25.242 --> 05:26.409
It's okay.

05:26.534 --> 05:27.577
You had a life before we met.

05:27.702 --> 05:28.829
We both did.

05:28.954 --> 05:29.537
Yeah.

05:31.498 --> 05:33.667
In fact, I'd like to share
some of mine with you

05:33.792 --> 05:35.169
as soon as she gets back
from visiting

05:35.294 --> 05:37.254
her grandparents.
Your daughter?

05:37.378 --> 05:39.047
I mean, you're a part
of my life.

05:39.173 --> 05:41.133
And once you meet her,
you'll be a part of hers.

05:41.258 --> 05:42.341
If you're ready.

05:44.886 --> 05:45.929
Yes.

05:46.054 --> 05:48.015
(chuckles)

05:48.140 --> 05:49.641
Yeah, yeah, I am.

05:51.685 --> 05:53.145
NAOMI:
Of course, Mrs. Fowler.

05:53.270 --> 05:55.396
I will invoice the caterers
immediately.

05:55.522 --> 05:57.816
You know, I'm very
impressed with you, Naomi.

05:57.941 --> 05:59.526
You've been working
around the clock

05:59.651 --> 06:01.695
through your break,
when most girls your age

06:01.820 --> 06:03.238
are off tanning in Cabo.

06:03.362 --> 06:05.282
My daughter's no exception.

06:05.406 --> 06:07.993
If she could major
in boys, she would.

06:08.118 --> 06:10.245
Well, personally,
I love working,

06:10.369 --> 06:11.872
and I find boys to be
a little overrated.

06:11.997 --> 06:14.916
Well, I do hope you're
maintaining a personal life.

06:15.042 --> 06:16.417
I'm fine.

06:16.543 --> 06:18.795
Actually, I'm better than fine--
I'm fabulous.

06:18.920 --> 06:20.547
Good, because we have a ton
of events this weekend,

06:20.672 --> 06:23.050
and I can't
micromanage them all.

06:23.175 --> 06:26.636
I think it's time to give you
a little more responsibility.

06:26.761 --> 06:28.805
I want you to run
your very first

06:28.930 --> 06:30.182
high-profile event.

06:30.307 --> 06:33.143
Now, I may stop by
to check on you,

06:33.268 --> 06:35.562
but it's the Pasadena
Debutante Snow Ball.

06:35.687 --> 06:38.606
The Debs' escorts will be cadets
from the naval academy.

06:38.732 --> 06:40.441
Thank you so much
for this opportunity, Rachel.

06:40.567 --> 06:43.611
You have so much
potential, Naomi.

06:43.737 --> 06:47.324
Keep it up, and there's
no telling how far you'll go.

06:47.448 --> 06:49.243
Sailors.

06:49.368 --> 06:51.953
I could use a little glow.

06:57.458 --> 06:59.336
(sighs)

06:59.460 --> 07:01.046
Hi, Liam.

07:01.171 --> 07:03.757
Wow. You're here.

07:03.882 --> 07:05.842
I just landed,
and we came straight over.

07:05.967 --> 07:07.594
Hmm.

07:07.719 --> 07:09.554
Well, I'm glad you
finally made it.

07:09.679 --> 07:11.932
I was beginning to think
you had moved to Paris.

07:13.308 --> 07:17.104
Uh... I got you something.

07:17.229 --> 07:19.981
(chuckles)

07:20.107 --> 07:21.733
Thanks.

07:21.858 --> 07:23.526
I'll put it up in the bar.

07:26.529 --> 07:27.364
You look great.

07:27.488 --> 07:29.241
Well, you know
what they say.

07:29.366 --> 07:31.076
Time heals all wounds.

07:31.201 --> 07:32.660
Well, most of them anyway.

07:32.786 --> 07:34.704
I don't know
what to say.

07:34.829 --> 07:37.165
I know that I should have
come home sooner.

07:38.458 --> 07:40.210
(chuckling)

07:41.753 --> 07:44.047
You know, when I found
out you were in trouble,

07:44.172 --> 07:45.840
I dropped everything,
and I went to find you.

07:45.966 --> 07:47.675
That's how I
ended up here.

07:47.801 --> 07:49.386
When you found
out I was hurt,

07:49.510 --> 07:51.471
you went shopping
for paper weights.

07:52.639 --> 07:55.309
Do they not have phones
in Paris?

07:55.434 --> 07:57.936
Liam, I didn't know
how to face you

07:58.061 --> 07:59.938
after everything that I did.

08:00.063 --> 08:01.564
Silver told me
that you found out

08:01.689 --> 08:04.859
about what I was doing
with Patrick.

08:04.985 --> 08:06.653
I was so ashamed.

08:08.613 --> 08:11.199
But the part
that I cannot believe

08:11.325 --> 08:15.495
is that my mistakes
almost cost you your life.

08:15.620 --> 08:17.414
I am so, so sorry.

08:17.538 --> 08:18.999
I don't want to
dredge up the past.

08:19.124 --> 08:20.417
I just want to
move forward.

08:20.541 --> 08:23.711
Well, I thought that...

08:23.837 --> 08:27.299
you know, maybe we could
do that together.

08:27.424 --> 08:29.968
At least let me drive you home.

08:30.093 --> 08:32.011
I'm guessing that you can't

08:32.136 --> 08:34.222
move forward
on a wrecked motorcycle.

08:35.849 --> 08:37.100
Actually, I already have a ride.
Thanks.

08:37.225 --> 08:39.019
I bribed
Nurse Tanya

08:39.144 --> 08:40.227
for pudding.
What?!

08:40.354 --> 08:41.770
(chuckling):
Yeah.

08:41.895 --> 08:43.898
Oh, cute bag.
I have the same one.

08:44.024 --> 08:45.692
LIAM:
Uh, Vanessa, Annie.
Annie, Vanessa.

08:45.817 --> 08:47.277
Vanessa was there
the night of the accident.

08:47.402 --> 08:48.820
She's been here every day since.

08:48.945 --> 08:50.489
Mm-hmm.

08:50.613 --> 08:51.614
VANESSA:
What?!

08:52.324 --> 08:53.950
You started without me?

08:54.075 --> 08:55.869
Oh, transparent front
portion of the eye--

08:55.994 --> 08:57.371
cornea.
Aha!

08:57.496 --> 09:00.165
Never would have known
had I not scratched mine.

09:00.290 --> 09:02.376
So, uh, Vanessa, you were there
the night of the accident?

09:02.501 --> 09:04.836
Were you the one
who called the police?
Yeah.

09:04.961 --> 09:06.338
I just wish I got
the license plate

09:06.463 --> 09:07.672
of the jerk who hit him.

09:07.797 --> 09:08.965
All we know is someone
in a black car

09:09.090 --> 09:09.632
swiped me and took off.

09:11.092 --> 09:12.635
Bonne année.

09:12.760 --> 09:13.887
Look, 24 down--

09:14.012 --> 09:14.971
"Happy New Year's in Paris."

09:15.096 --> 09:16.597
Bonne année.

09:16.723 --> 09:17.807
Oh! Nice.

09:17.932 --> 09:19.017
Oui?

09:19.142 --> 09:20.060
(chuckles)

09:20.185 --> 09:22.103
Oui.

09:23.980 --> 09:25.940
Oh, dude!

09:26.066 --> 09:27.234
Hey!

09:27.359 --> 09:29.861
Close the blinds!

09:29.986 --> 09:31.821
Have you been laying on my couch
since I left?

09:31.946 --> 09:33.656
Yeah, I don't want people
to know where I am.

09:33.781 --> 09:35.450
What people?

09:35.575 --> 09:39.120
Uh, the... the people that tried
to jump me for my wallet.

09:39.246 --> 09:40.788
They might be looking
to finish the job.

09:40.914 --> 09:42.290
Navid, okay.

09:42.416 --> 09:44.876
Uh... look, I-I get
that you're freaked out, okay?

09:45.001 --> 09:46.836
I get it.

09:46.961 --> 09:49.548
But maybe we should just
go outside.

09:49.672 --> 09:52.509
Get some fresh air and-and...
maybe a salad.

09:52.633 --> 09:54.386
You bought me
flowers?

09:54.511 --> 09:56.221
No, sweetheart,
I didn't.

09:56.346 --> 09:57.597
They were outside
when I came in.

09:59.307 --> 10:00.934
There's a card, though.

10:01.059 --> 10:02.936
"Navid, you are very lucky
to be alive.

10:03.061 --> 10:03.978
"Please be more careful
in the future.

10:04.104 --> 10:07.148
Uncle Amal."

10:07.274 --> 10:09.317
Yeah, I guess he knows
you got mugged.

10:09.443 --> 10:11.819
Yeah, and he also knows
where I am.

10:33.967 --> 10:34.968
(chuckling):
Whoa.

10:35.093 --> 10:36.470
You own this place?

10:36.595 --> 10:37.887
Yeah.

10:38.012 --> 10:39.306
Yeah.
Very cool.

10:39.431 --> 10:40.181
Thanks.
Yeah.

10:40.307 --> 10:42.476
Uh... you want something?

10:42.601 --> 10:43.977
Uh, like a soda or something?

10:44.102 --> 10:45.479
Uh, we got tea.
I know girls like tea.

10:45.604 --> 10:48.189
Oh, well, this
girl likes beer.

10:48.315 --> 10:49.399
Nice.

10:49.524 --> 10:52.652
Uh, you know, I don't know
if I should hang.

10:52.777 --> 10:57.698
I-I got a, uh, territorial vibe
from that Annie girl back there.

10:57.824 --> 10:59.867
She's an ex, right?

10:59.993 --> 11:01.744
Ex, current-- I don't know.

11:01.869 --> 11:02.996
We go back and forth a lot.

11:03.121 --> 11:05.081
I get that.

11:05.206 --> 11:06.666
People repeat patterns

11:06.791 --> 11:08.627
until...

11:08.751 --> 11:10.545
something new
shakes them out of it.

11:10.670 --> 11:12.797
You mean like
a brush with death?

11:14.966 --> 11:16.217
Man, speaking of
the same old patterns,

11:16.343 --> 11:18.470
I can't believe I just
got out of the hospital,

11:18.595 --> 11:20.721
and the first thing
I'm gonna do is open bills.

11:20.847 --> 11:23.016
Well, what
would you do?

11:23.141 --> 11:25.018
I mean, if you
could do anything.

11:25.143 --> 11:26.102
I don't know.

11:26.227 --> 11:28.146
Something fearless.

11:28.271 --> 11:29.189
Like skydiving.

11:32.859 --> 11:34.653
That's a great idea.

11:34.777 --> 11:35.736
Let's do it.

11:35.862 --> 11:37.822
What, now?

11:37.947 --> 11:40.116
Uh, yeah, the doctor said
to take it easy.

11:40.241 --> 11:44.954
Let's break out of old patterns
and try something new.

11:45.079 --> 11:46.831
Unless, of course,

11:46.956 --> 11:49.292
(whispers):
you're scared or whatever.

11:49.417 --> 11:51.545
Oh, you're on.

11:51.670 --> 11:52.337
(laughs)
Yeah? Okay.

11:55.882 --> 11:58.635
KAT:
Navid, why did you call me
down to your father's office?

11:58.759 --> 12:00.094
What if Amal finds you?
He already did.

12:00.220 --> 12:01.971
What are you doing?

12:02.096 --> 12:03.264
Well, there's got to be
something here to just,

12:03.390 --> 12:04.891
to bring my uncle down now.

12:05.016 --> 12:05.892
For good.

12:06.017 --> 12:07.268
Navid, be patient.

12:07.394 --> 12:09.062
Okay, we're watching him.

12:09.187 --> 12:10.271
Are you?

12:10.397 --> 12:12.440
Did you know about
the flowers he sent me?

12:12.566 --> 12:14.275
No, but we'll handle it.

12:14.401 --> 12:15.734
Yeah, that's the point, Kat.

12:15.860 --> 12:17.028
You're not handling it.

12:17.153 --> 12:18.405
So now I have to.

12:23.784 --> 12:24.327
What is that?

12:24.452 --> 12:25.786
I'll confront Amal myself.

12:25.912 --> 12:26.787
Stop!

12:26.913 --> 12:29.499
Okay?

12:29.624 --> 12:31.710
They let you off with
a warning, Navid.

12:31.834 --> 12:33.920
Next time,
they won't be so gentle.

12:34.045 --> 12:35.630
That's not the only gun
in the world, Kat.

12:39.676 --> 12:41.135
Okay.

12:41.261 --> 12:42.512
I checked the windows,

12:42.637 --> 12:44.763
and I'm on State Farm's
Web site right now

12:44.889 --> 12:47.267
trying to get a quote
on renter's insurance.

12:47.392 --> 12:49.352
I mean, if it's that easy
for Holly to get in here,

12:49.477 --> 12:50.562
there's no telling
who else could.

12:50.687 --> 12:51.521
I got to make sure
my stuff's covered.

12:51.646 --> 12:53.898
What do you have
that is so valuable?

12:54.023 --> 12:57.402
Uh, how about an original
signed Lynyrd Skynyrd album?

12:57.527 --> 12:58.528
Okay. Sorry.
Geez.

12:58.653 --> 12:59.237
Check it out.

12:59.362 --> 13:01.322
I'm actually saving money

13:01.448 --> 13:04.158
by bundling it with the policy
I already have on my truck.

13:04.284 --> 13:05.285
That was easy enough.

13:05.410 --> 13:06.745
Now all I got to do
is call my agent.

13:06.869 --> 13:08.121
Dude, why are you
working so hard

13:08.246 --> 13:09.664
to prove that Holly snuck in?

13:09.788 --> 13:11.416
Why don't you just admit
that you cheated?

13:11.541 --> 13:12.875
Because I didn't.

13:13.000 --> 13:15.044
I can't believe you think
I'm such a bad guy.

13:15.169 --> 13:16.795
Hey, would a bad guy get you two
a gig tomorrow night

13:16.921 --> 13:18.005
opening up for Scotty McCreery
at Vendome?

13:18.131 --> 13:20.174
Wait, what?

13:20.300 --> 13:21.676
Yeah, my dad's tour
manager reps him,

13:21.800 --> 13:23.802
and his opening act
had to cancel, so...

13:25.680 --> 13:27.599
Dude, that's a-amazing!

13:27.724 --> 13:30.143
Who's a bad guy now?

13:30.268 --> 13:32.186
(laughs)

13:32.312 --> 13:33.396
(grunts)

13:35.106 --> 13:37.692
A thousand extra for leather?

13:37.816 --> 13:39.736
(sighs)
Okay, done.

13:39.860 --> 13:41.904
I'm loving your new look,
but leather?

13:42.029 --> 13:43.239
It's not for me.

13:43.364 --> 13:45.450
I'm getting Liam's bike
fixed as a surprise.

13:45.575 --> 13:47.410
Wow, that's really
generous of you.

13:47.535 --> 13:48.411
Well, I want to

13:48.536 --> 13:49.663
make up for the fact

13:49.788 --> 13:50.538
that I wasn't there
during his recovery.

13:50.664 --> 13:51.914
New year,

13:52.039 --> 13:53.832
fresh start.
Oh, speaking of which,

13:53.958 --> 13:55.126
I'm gonna be too busy
with the Snowball

13:55.251 --> 13:56.419
to plan your going-away party.

13:56.544 --> 13:58.171
But I totally think
you should do it yourself.

13:58.296 --> 14:01.090
I am still not sure yet
if I am going away.

14:01.215 --> 14:03.134
And even if I were,
there is no way

14:03.259 --> 14:05.011
that I could throw
a massive shindig

14:05.136 --> 14:05.762
like you could
by myself.

14:05.886 --> 14:07.514
Okay.

14:07.639 --> 14:09.683
This is it.
This is the last of it.

14:09.808 --> 14:12.185
Oh, I'm sad to see you
all moved out.

14:12.310 --> 14:13.645
Yeah, well,

14:13.770 --> 14:15.438
I wish I could say
the same for Navid.

14:15.563 --> 14:17.315
His crap is still
all over my place.

14:17.440 --> 14:19.734
Guys, I was hanging out with
Greg today, and I looked down,

14:19.859 --> 14:22.362
and suddenly I realized
I'm wearing Navid's sweater.

14:22.487 --> 14:24.531
Here I am just
trying to move on,

14:24.656 --> 14:26.157
and I literally have
Navid all over me.

14:26.282 --> 14:27.325
IVY:
Yeah, tell me about it.

14:27.450 --> 14:28.743
I've been trying
to kick this jet lag

14:28.868 --> 14:29.994
by drinking coffee 24/7.

14:30.119 --> 14:32.664
Doesn't exactly help when
every time I go to take a sip,

14:32.789 --> 14:33.956
I have to see Raj's face.

14:34.081 --> 14:36.000
Get a new mug.

14:36.125 --> 14:38.336
(sighs softly)

14:38.461 --> 14:41.172
Okay, so maybe
I did have

14:41.297 --> 14:43.174
a little thing with
Nick in New Guinea.

14:43.299 --> 14:44.467
And I know it's
still really soon,

14:44.592 --> 14:46.511
and I don't really
know what it was,

14:46.636 --> 14:49.013
but I got to say
it was pretty nice.

14:49.138 --> 14:51.057
Of course it was nice;
it's called rebound sex.

14:51.182 --> 14:52.559
Nothing erases a painful memory

14:52.684 --> 14:54.644
like replacing it
with a hot new one.

14:54.769 --> 14:55.228
Yeah, if only that
actually worked.

14:55.353 --> 14:56.187
NAOMI:
No, it does,

14:56.312 --> 14:57.522
which is why I plan on

14:57.647 --> 14:59.399
erasing every memory
of me and Austin

14:59.524 --> 15:01.651
by having hot rebound sex
with a Naval cadet

15:01.776 --> 15:02.694
tomorrow night
at the Snowball.
Hmm.

15:02.819 --> 15:05.154
New year, fresh start;
isn't that what you said?

15:05.279 --> 15:06.698
(laughs)

15:06.823 --> 15:09.325
Hey, maybe instead
of a good-bye party,

15:09.450 --> 15:12.119
we have a "hello to
a new year" party.

15:12.245 --> 15:15.081
I mean, none of us got to spend
an actual New Year's together.

15:15.206 --> 15:16.875
NAOMI:
"Hello to a new year" party--
I like that.

15:16.999 --> 15:17.584
(chuckles)

15:17.709 --> 15:19.669
And I think
you're gonna be just fine.

15:19.794 --> 15:21.128
You'll be able
to pull it off.

15:21.254 --> 15:23.840
If you get stuck, take
a deep breath and think WWND.

15:23.964 --> 15:25.717
Hmm?

15:25.842 --> 15:28.762
"What Would Naomi Do?"

15:41.441 --> 15:42.776
Silver.

15:42.901 --> 15:44.527
Look, I'm sorry
to ambush you like this,

15:44.652 --> 15:46.279
but we need to talk about Navid.

15:46.404 --> 15:47.739
Navid doesn't
live here

15:47.864 --> 15:49.365
anymore, okay?

15:49.490 --> 15:50.491
So, whatever kind of shady stuff

15:50.617 --> 15:52.660
you guys got going on,
I don't care.

15:52.786 --> 15:55.079
If you don't leave,
I'm calling the police.

15:55.204 --> 15:56.414
I am the police.

16:02.462 --> 16:03.838
I never should've let
him wear the wire.

16:03.963 --> 16:08.050
I knew it was dangerous,
but he was desperate.

16:08.175 --> 16:09.343
Why didn't he tell me?

16:09.469 --> 16:09.928
He was
protecting you.

16:10.052 --> 16:11.971
He still is.

16:12.096 --> 16:14.474
Which is why I'm afraid he's
gonna do something stupid.

16:14.599 --> 16:15.809
I need you to talk to him.

16:15.934 --> 16:17.351
Why would he listen
to me and not you?

16:17.477 --> 16:18.686
What is there, like,
a conflict of interest

16:18.812 --> 16:20.062
'cause you're his girlfriend?

16:20.187 --> 16:21.898
Girlfriend? No.

16:22.064 --> 16:24.317
Navid never saw me that way.

16:24.442 --> 16:25.735
He loves you.

16:25.860 --> 16:28.571
If anyone can get through
to him, it's you.

16:28.696 --> 16:30.448
I've already tried
to talk to him.

16:30.573 --> 16:31.324
He won't listen to me, okay?

16:31.449 --> 16:33.618
I don't know what else I can do.

16:33.743 --> 16:35.035
Navid is not in my life anymore.

16:35.161 --> 16:37.413
Well, you're still in his.

16:37.538 --> 16:38.873
You've got to
do something.

16:38.998 --> 16:41.375
Please. For him.

16:43.878 --> 16:45.713
ADRIANNA:
Wow, I can't believe we're
playing here tonight.

16:45.839 --> 16:46.798
I can.

16:46.923 --> 16:49.383
We're a bad-ass team,
we deserve a bad-ass debut, huh?

16:49.509 --> 16:50.343
Come here.

16:50.468 --> 16:52.637
(chuckles)

16:52.762 --> 16:53.972
Hey.

16:54.096 --> 16:55.640
Hi.
Trent Thomas.

16:55.765 --> 16:57.016
Adrianna.
Hey. General manager.

16:57.141 --> 16:58.225
Hey. Dixon.

16:58.351 --> 16:59.727
Wow!

16:59.853 --> 17:03.063
Uh, I thought the rear view
was impressive.

17:03.189 --> 17:04.147
(chuckles)

17:04.272 --> 17:05.316
You're beautiful.
Thank you.

17:05.441 --> 17:07.193
I'm getting you a spotlight.

17:07.318 --> 17:08.194
Oh, no.

17:08.319 --> 17:09.569
No spotlight.

17:09.695 --> 17:11.321
We're a team.
Yeah.

17:11.446 --> 17:13.240
No offense to K-Fed here,
but sexy

17:13.366 --> 17:14.659
is what sells tickets.

17:14.784 --> 17:15.535
Promise me

17:15.660 --> 17:17.369
that you'll wear
something tight tonight.

17:17.494 --> 17:18.371
Believe me, you
will see plenty.

17:18.496 --> 17:20.414
Can you excuse us
for a second?

17:20.540 --> 17:22.541
Honey, a moment,
please.
Yeah.

17:23.209 --> 17:25.252
What was that?

17:25.377 --> 17:27.128
Did that cheese bag really try
to hit on you in front of me?

17:27.253 --> 17:28.130
Dixon, calm down, okay?

17:28.255 --> 17:30.132
It's all about playing the game.

17:30.257 --> 17:32.218
What's the game, trying
to get in your pants?

17:32.343 --> 17:34.012
Do you want this gig or not?

17:34.136 --> 17:35.680
Of course I want it.

17:35.805 --> 17:37.974
Okay, well, then let's go
finish our sound check, okay?

17:38.098 --> 17:39.934
(sighs softly)

17:49.235 --> 17:51.988
What are you doing?

17:52.112 --> 17:53.364
You're actually studying?

17:53.489 --> 17:54.908
Classes don't start
for another week.

17:55.033 --> 17:56.576
No, this is my to-do list
for the Snowball.

17:56.701 --> 17:57.994
I have to make sure
everything is perfect.

17:58.118 --> 17:59.370
Oh, let me see.

17:59.495 --> 18:00.371
NICK:
Hey.

18:00.496 --> 18:01.789
Hey.

18:01.915 --> 18:03.791
Did you get my
text message?

18:03.917 --> 18:05.084
Um, yeah.

18:05.209 --> 18:07.837
Sorry, I just, I've been really
busy with a bunch of stuff.

18:07.962 --> 18:10.006
Okay.

18:10.130 --> 18:11.674
Naomi here was actually
just telling me about

18:11.799 --> 18:12.926
some horrible debutante ball
she's planning.

18:13.051 --> 18:14.093
Hey, you know what,

18:14.218 --> 18:15.762
it might not be
everyone's cup of tea,

18:15.887 --> 18:18.138
but neither is hippie hair,
and you seem to make that work.

18:18.264 --> 18:20.725
What does bikini wax have to do
with a debutante ball?

18:20.850 --> 18:22.560
I'm having sex tonight to
help me move on from Austin.

18:22.685 --> 18:23.770
Not unlike

18:23.895 --> 18:26.230
how you so generously helped
our little Ivy here

18:26.355 --> 18:27.648
rebound from Raj.
(laughs)

18:27.774 --> 18:28.900
All right, I really
have to motor.

18:29.025 --> 18:30.317
If I'm late,

18:30.443 --> 18:32.695
Anoushka is not gentle
in the delicate areas,

18:32.820 --> 18:34.280
if you know what I mean.
(laughs)

18:34.405 --> 18:35.823
Tah!

18:42.830 --> 18:44.415
Rebound sex?

18:44.540 --> 18:46.208
Look, Nick, that's not
what I called it.

18:46.333 --> 18:49.087
Let's be honest, though.

18:49.211 --> 18:52.298
I mean, we both knew
what that was, didn't we?

18:52.423 --> 18:54.717
I mean, it's not like my divorce
is even final yet.

18:54.842 --> 18:56.844
No, I get it.

18:59.013 --> 19:00.932
No harm, no foul.

19:01.057 --> 19:03.267
I'll see you around.

19:07.855 --> 19:09.565
(laughs)

19:09.690 --> 19:11.567
Oh, my God!

19:11.692 --> 19:13.152
Thank you so much
for picking it up.

19:13.277 --> 19:14.320
It looks awesome.

19:14.445 --> 19:16.322
I know it does.
Oh.

19:16.447 --> 19:17.448
Man, when you got rich,

19:17.573 --> 19:19.158
I should've held out
for more than a hat.

19:19.283 --> 19:20.159
(chuckles)

19:20.284 --> 19:22.078
Think Liam
will like it?

19:22.202 --> 19:24.204
Do I think Liam--
He's gonna lose his mind.

19:24.330 --> 19:25.748
Oh, I can't wait
to see his face.

19:25.873 --> 19:27.917
And then I have to get back
to party planning.

19:28.042 --> 19:30.419
And you should probably
get ready for your big show.

19:30.544 --> 19:32.546
Listen, I have a...
I have a question.

19:32.672 --> 19:34.214
Hmm.

19:34.340 --> 19:37.093
Would you let a guy hit on you
for the sake of a job?

19:37.217 --> 19:39.553
I-I guess it
depends on the job.

19:39.679 --> 19:41.889
Sometimes it's necessary.

19:42.015 --> 19:44.142
And though I would love to
spend all day enlightening you

19:44.266 --> 19:46.060
on the challenges
of modern woman--

19:46.185 --> 19:48.270
(car door closes)
Here's Liam.

19:48.395 --> 19:49.522
And that girl Vanessa.

19:52.066 --> 19:52.984
What's this?

19:53.109 --> 19:55.277
Surprise!

19:55.402 --> 19:57.780
The mechanic said it is better
than new or my money back.

19:57.905 --> 19:59.157
Wow.

19:59.281 --> 20:01.367
You didn't have to do this.

20:01.492 --> 20:02.618
I wanted to.

20:02.743 --> 20:04.704
I know how much
you love this bike.

20:04.829 --> 20:06.622
Would you guys
give us a second?

20:06.747 --> 20:08.499
VANESSA:
Oh, yeah.

20:08.624 --> 20:10.376
I'll just wait
in the car.
DIXON:
Sure.

20:10.501 --> 20:14.254
So you two are
still hanging out?

20:14.380 --> 20:17.466
Yeah.

20:17.591 --> 20:19.677
Annie, this is too much.

20:19.802 --> 20:22.013
I just thought that I
could make things right.

20:22.138 --> 20:26.392
I thought maybe
you and I could start over.

20:26.517 --> 20:27.894
Yeah, that's-that's
the thing.

20:28.019 --> 20:30.604
I don't think we can.

20:30.730 --> 20:32.773
I-I think it's time
we both try something new.

20:32.899 --> 20:34.859
VANESSA:
Liam!

20:34.984 --> 20:36.027
I'm just gonna
catch you later, okay?

20:36.152 --> 20:37.444
No, no, no.
Hold on, I'm coming.

20:37.570 --> 20:39.613
Yesterday we went skydiving,

20:39.739 --> 20:40.865
today she wants to
check out bungee jumping.

20:40.990 --> 20:42.449
Wow.

20:42.575 --> 20:43.534
(chuckles)

20:43.659 --> 20:45.203
Well, yeah,
it definitely sounds like

20:45.327 --> 20:46.746
you're trying something new.

20:46.871 --> 20:49.415
Man, this is incredible of you.

20:49.540 --> 20:50.416
Really.

20:50.541 --> 20:52.501
Thank you.

20:52.626 --> 20:54.461
But I'm gonna pay you back.

20:54.587 --> 20:56.756
I got to go.

20:56.881 --> 20:58.716
Mm.

20:58.841 --> 21:00.718
I guess I'll leave
the keys in the bar.

21:00.843 --> 21:01.928
Thanks.

21:02.053 --> 21:03.303
Ready?
Yeah.

21:03.429 --> 21:04.805
You okay?

21:04.931 --> 21:06.682
Hmm.

21:06.807 --> 21:09.518
He didn't exactly
lose his mind.

21:09.643 --> 21:11.979
DIXON:
I hope he knows
how much trouble you went to.

21:12.105 --> 21:14.732
The mechanic said it
took about half a day

21:14.857 --> 21:16.609
just to get the maroon
paint off the chrome.

21:16.734 --> 21:18.111
Maroon?
Mm-hmm.

21:18.236 --> 21:21.948
Liam said that the car
that hit him was black.

21:22.073 --> 21:23.407
Maybe he didn't see
the guy who hit him.

21:23.532 --> 21:25.367
Yeah, maybe he didn't.

21:25.492 --> 21:28.788

maybe she was feeling guilty

do with putting you there.

23:38.334 --> 23:40.753

Vanessa said that a black car
hit you, but the mechanic said

23:43.714 --> 23:46.759
that your bike was covered
in maroon paint.

23:46.884 --> 23:48.719
Hmm.

26:07.858 --> 26:11.445
No. No, no.... No!

26:11.569 --> 26:12.988
Oh! Oh, my God!

26:13.113 --> 26:15.533
Let's just, uh, enjoy
the rest of the evening.

26:15.657 --> 26:16.867
Dance, please. Music!

26:19.036 --> 26:20.538
(knock at door)

26:29.255 --> 26:31.298
Silver, hey.

26:31.424 --> 26:34.634
What... what are you doing here?

26:34.760 --> 26:37.721
Thought you never
wanted to talk to me again.

26:37.846 --> 26:41.016
Um... I'm not the one
who wants to talk to you.

26:47.356 --> 26:48.941
Hello, Navid.

26:49.066 --> 26:51.235
(soft gasp)

26:51.360 --> 26:53.529
Dad.

26:59.326 --> 27:02.329
I am really disappointed
in you, Naomi.

27:02.455 --> 27:03.330
You know, I know

27:03.456 --> 27:04.831
I told you to get
a personal life,

27:04.957 --> 27:06.500
but I didn't mean
while you were working.

27:06.624 --> 27:07.501
Rachel, I'm sorry, okay?

27:07.625 --> 27:08.919
I know this was my shot
and I blew it...

27:09.044 --> 27:09.795
But what?

27:09.920 --> 27:11.464
What possible excuse
could there be for making

27:11.589 --> 27:13.591
such an utter
fool of yourself?

27:13.715 --> 27:16.343
Actually, I can't
tell you that.

27:16.469 --> 27:19.346
Well, then I am afraid I have
no choice but to let you go.

27:19.472 --> 27:21.807
My boyfriend cheated on me
with your daughter.

27:21.932 --> 27:23.809
What?

27:23.934 --> 27:27.146
I'm sorry, okay, I know
that it's still no excuse

27:27.271 --> 27:30.732
and I swore I wasn't going
to let it affect my work.

27:30.857 --> 27:32.526
I just thought, if I had
a meaningless fling,

27:32.650 --> 27:34.861
it would help me move on
or something, I don't know.

27:34.987 --> 27:37.781
Holly has always
wanted my approval,

27:37.906 --> 27:41.243
and I guess offering you the
internship instead of her

27:41.368 --> 27:43.162
hasn't exactly
endeared you to her.

27:44.455 --> 27:46.332
She's mad at me,

27:46.457 --> 27:49.418
but she took it out on you,
and for that I am sorry.

27:50.169 --> 27:53.046
Does that mean...?

27:53.172 --> 27:55.966
Consider this a
stay of execution.

27:56.091 --> 27:58.135
Oh, thank you, thank you.
Oh, just--

27:58.260 --> 27:59.553
a strong woman admits
when she's hurt

27:59.677 --> 28:02.222
and she faces her
problems head on.

28:02.348 --> 28:03.932
She never takes her
eye off the ball,

28:04.057 --> 28:06.143
especially
not for a man.

28:06.268 --> 28:08.770
Now, who do you
want to be, Naomi,

28:08.895 --> 28:12.399
a strong woman or just
the girl who gets the guy?

28:19.072 --> 28:21.741
I'm grateful
Silver called me.

28:21.867 --> 28:23.619
You're in a lot of trouble.

28:23.743 --> 28:25.579
Is that what you came
here to tell me?

28:25.703 --> 28:27.122
Dad, I-I know it's my fault.

28:27.247 --> 28:29.082
I, I know I was supposed to take
care of the studio, of Leila,

28:29.208 --> 28:31.669
but I needed the money.

28:31.793 --> 28:33.753
I didn't know
it was gonna get this bad.

28:33.879 --> 28:36.714
I'm not angry with you, Navid.

28:36.840 --> 28:39.468
You thought you were doing the
best you could for your family,

28:39.593 --> 28:41.720
for the ones
you love, huh?

28:41.845 --> 28:44.723
Like father, like son.

28:48.268 --> 28:49.853
I'm turning myself in.

28:49.978 --> 28:51.021
Dad...

28:51.146 --> 28:52.814
I can give the police
what they need

28:52.939 --> 28:55.734
to put Amal and his
associates behind bars.

28:55.859 --> 28:59.238
It's the only way
that you'll be safe.

28:59.363 --> 29:03.992
Everything I did,
I did for my family.

29:04.117 --> 29:06.161
I'm, I'm so sorry.

29:06.286 --> 29:10.040
It's not your fault.

29:10.165 --> 29:12.959
It's not your fault,
son, it's mine.

29:13.085 --> 29:14.753
(exhales)

29:17.506 --> 29:19.132
Hey.

29:19.258 --> 29:21.134
What are you doing here?

29:21.260 --> 29:22.678
Shouldn't you be onstage
right about now?

29:22.802 --> 29:24.263
(chuckles)

29:24.388 --> 29:25.347
We got fired.

29:25.472 --> 29:26.890
The club manager
was hitting

29:27.015 --> 29:29.476
on Ade, so I hit him.

29:29.602 --> 29:30.352
Yeah, that'll do it.

29:30.477 --> 29:32.563
He was all over her, dude--

29:32.688 --> 29:34.064
ugh-- and she wasn't exactly
shutting him down.

29:34.189 --> 29:35.315
You know what I mean?

29:35.441 --> 29:36.983
Well, it sounds to me
like he came on to her.

29:37.109 --> 29:38.110
I mean, that doesn't
make her guilty.

29:38.235 --> 29:39.486
Yeah, I know, but...

29:39.612 --> 29:40.738
But nothing.

29:40.862 --> 29:44.824
Listen, you have to trust
the person you're dating.

29:44.950 --> 29:45.784
Okay, if Naomi
would have done that,

29:45.909 --> 29:47.035
I wouldn't be sitting here
drowning my sorrows

29:47.160 --> 29:48.870
in warm beer.

29:48.995 --> 29:50.122
Do yourself
a favor

29:50.247 --> 29:52.291
and fix it while you still can.

30:03.343 --> 30:05.345
You made it before midnight.

30:05.471 --> 30:06.805
(chuckles)
What is this?

30:06.930 --> 30:08.014
Where's the party?

30:08.140 --> 30:10.350
This is, this is kind of it.

30:10.476 --> 30:13.061
Okay, that's the Grim Reaper.

30:13.186 --> 30:14.187
Honey, that's Halloween.

30:14.313 --> 30:15.606
It was on sale

30:15.731 --> 30:17.733
and I thought it was
a Father Time costume.

30:17.857 --> 30:19.025
It's not.
Maybe I should
have spent

30:19.151 --> 30:22.028
less time worrying about Liam
and more time figuring out:

30:22.154 --> 30:23.697
what would Naomi do?

30:23.822 --> 30:25.240
Actually, I'm not sure
what Naomi would do

30:25.365 --> 30:26.825
is always the best plan.

30:26.950 --> 30:29.119
Hey, how'd
that snowball thing go,

30:29.244 --> 30:31.622
or more importantly,
how was the rebound sex?

30:31.747 --> 30:33.749
It was revealing.

30:33.873 --> 30:35.584
Um, I'm starting
to think

30:35.709 --> 30:37.877
rebound sex doesn't
actually work.

30:38.003 --> 30:39.505
Would you excuse me?

30:39.630 --> 30:40.714
You know, she's right.

30:40.839 --> 30:42.758
I mean, it would be
nice to think we could

30:42.882 --> 30:45.260
just move on free and
clear from the past,

30:45.385 --> 30:47.012
but we all know that
doesn't exactly work.

30:47.137 --> 30:49.097
I think it can.
Really?

30:49.222 --> 30:51.517
Is that why you got
Liam's bike repaired

30:51.642 --> 30:52.184
and then accused
his girlfriend

30:52.309 --> 30:54.060
of running him over?

30:54.186 --> 30:56.021
Okay, she is
so not his girlfriend.

30:56.146 --> 30:57.063
No, but maybe she
would be, Annie,

30:57.189 --> 30:58.732
if you just stopped butting in.

30:58.898 --> 31:01.943
It's scary moving forward--
trust me, I get it--

31:02.068 --> 31:03.445
but you're also
not exactly

31:03.570 --> 31:05.447
letting Liam move
forward either.

31:11.077 --> 31:14.373
Hey, you okay?

31:14.498 --> 31:15.666
Seem kind of quiet.

31:15.791 --> 31:18.669
You told the police
everything you know, right?

31:18.794 --> 31:23.465
I did, but like I said,
I didn't see much.

31:23.590 --> 31:24.842
It was dark and it all
happened so fast that...

31:24.966 --> 31:26.552
Yeah.

31:28.554 --> 31:32.432
Look... if you and Annie
still have feelings

31:32.558 --> 31:35.143
for each other,
that's fine.
Ten, nine,

31:35.268 --> 31:37.312
eight, seven...
But I'm not here

31:37.437 --> 31:40.148
to be accused of
something I didn't do...
...six, five...

31:40.273 --> 31:42.693
...because you guys are
still figuring out your deal.
...four, three...

31:42.818 --> 31:43.819
two...

31:43.943 --> 31:45.821
one!

31:45.945 --> 31:47.531
Happy New Year!

31:47.656 --> 31:49.825
(cheering)

31:51.660 --> 31:53.203
I need a drink.

31:56.790 --> 31:59.125
Liam, wait, I have
to talk to you.

31:59.251 --> 32:01.086
Don't you think
you've said enough?
Yeah,

32:01.211 --> 32:03.296
actually, too much.

32:03.422 --> 32:05.758
I think I was
inventing reasons

32:05.883 --> 32:07.676
why you shouldn't
be with Vanessa

32:07.801 --> 32:11.471
because I was afraid
to let you go.

32:11.597 --> 32:14.266
I didn't want you to move
on, and that's not fair.

32:14.391 --> 32:17.227
No, it wasn't.

32:17.352 --> 32:18.687
But what if you're right?

32:18.812 --> 32:20.063
I mean, I hardly
know her.

32:20.188 --> 32:21.273
What if I'm just
moving too fast

32:21.398 --> 32:22.691
'cause it's new
and different?

32:22.816 --> 32:24.401
No, don't listen to me.

32:24.526 --> 32:27.696
I was completely
out of line.

32:27.821 --> 32:31.575
If you really like the girl,
then... you should go for it.

32:34.160 --> 32:36.121
Thanks, Annie.

32:42.711 --> 32:45.589
Hey.

32:56.558 --> 32:59.018
And I wanted to say
that I'm going to miss you all

32:59.144 --> 33:01.605
so, so much
because I have decided

33:01.730 --> 33:04.023
to go to Carnegie Mellon!

33:04.149 --> 33:06.860
So, here is to fresh starts.

33:14.576 --> 33:15.953
Hey.

33:16.077 --> 33:18.705
Uh... glad
you made it.

33:18.831 --> 33:21.249
Well, we're no longer welcome
at Vendome.

33:21.374 --> 33:24.043
I'm sorry I lost it, okay?

33:24.169 --> 33:26.797
I guess... working together
and being together

33:26.922 --> 33:29.675
is going to be a lot more
complicated than I expected.

33:29.800 --> 33:33.512
Dixon, the music business
is filled with guys like that.

33:33.637 --> 33:36.097
We're never going to make it
if you can't trust me.

33:36.222 --> 33:38.057
I know. I know.

33:38.183 --> 33:40.560
And I trust you.

33:40.686 --> 33:41.979
I just don't trust
those other guys.

33:42.103 --> 33:45.231
Do you really think that I'd
be interested in him over you?

33:45.357 --> 33:46.358
I don't know.

33:46.483 --> 33:47.693
(sighs)

33:47.818 --> 33:48.986
Look, the guy owns a club.

33:49.110 --> 33:50.529
I mean, he could get you
a headliner gig.

33:50.654 --> 33:52.071
Yeah, well,
I can get my own gigs.

33:52.197 --> 33:53.406
We can, okay?

33:53.532 --> 33:57.285
We are a badass team, remember?

33:57.410 --> 34:01.456
Yeah.
(chuckles)

34:01.581 --> 34:04.250
Uh... think it's, uh, too late
for a midnight kiss?

34:06.169 --> 34:08.045
I think we could get it in
under the wire.

34:08.170 --> 34:09.380
Think so?
Mm-hmm.

34:28.900 --> 34:31.570
Annie knows it's not
actually New Year's, right?

34:31.695 --> 34:33.739
Um, think she just
likes the spirit of it.

34:33.864 --> 34:35.447
Ah.

34:35.574 --> 34:36.824
Out with the old,
in with the new and all that.

34:36.949 --> 34:38.368
Hmm.

34:40.036 --> 34:42.246
That actually sounds
pretty good right now.

34:42.371 --> 34:43.121
(sighs)

34:43.248 --> 34:44.917
Do you want to go...

34:45.042 --> 34:46.585
Yeah, let's...
Okay.

34:52.424 --> 34:56.053
So is, um... is everything
okay with your dad?

34:56.177 --> 34:57.512
He's turning himself in.

34:57.637 --> 35:00.599
Yeah, with what he
has on my uncle,

35:00.724 --> 35:02.768
they're both going
away for a long time.

35:02.893 --> 35:04.603
Navid, I'm so sorry.

35:04.728 --> 35:06.438
No, Silver.
No, I didn't know what to do.

35:06.563 --> 35:08.732
I just... I hope that you
don't think that I overstepped.

35:08.857 --> 35:09.858
Silver, if you hadn't
have made that call,

35:09.983 --> 35:11.693
I don't even want to think
what might have happened.

35:11.818 --> 35:16.740
I... I-I'm so lucky to
have you in my life.

35:16.865 --> 35:19.868
Now that everything's
out in the open, I...

35:19.993 --> 35:22.412
I was hoping
we could start over.

35:22.537 --> 35:23.747
Start over?

35:23.872 --> 35:25.123
I-I want us
to be able

35:25.248 --> 35:26.458
to tell each other everything
and...

35:26.583 --> 35:28.585
I-I don't want us
to have secrets.

35:28.710 --> 35:29.920
Uh, neither do I.

35:30.045 --> 35:34.132
Which is why I should tell you
I'm still seeing Greg.

35:34.883 --> 35:36.760
I'm...

35:36.885 --> 35:39.012
I'm glad everything is resolved
with your family,

35:39.137 --> 35:41.807
and I will always care
about you,

35:41.932 --> 35:46.352
but I can't just go back
to the way things were.

35:46.478 --> 35:47.896
It's just not that simple.

35:48.021 --> 35:50.023
Yeah.

35:53.110 --> 35:55.194
I'm sorry.

36:04.955 --> 36:06.539
Hey.

36:06.665 --> 36:08.166
Hey.

36:08.959 --> 36:10.961
Uh...

36:11.086 --> 36:14.506
why aren't you at the party?

36:14.631 --> 36:17.592
Probably 'cause you're not.

36:17.717 --> 36:21.847
Look, Nick, I was clearly lying

36:21.972 --> 36:24.141
when I said that you
were just a rebound.

36:24.265 --> 36:27.644
And I know,
I loved Raj,

36:27.769 --> 36:29.896
but we're over now,

36:30.022 --> 36:32.899
and...

36:33.025 --> 36:38.155
as scary as it is to have
feelings for somebody so soon,

36:38.279 --> 36:39.531
I do.

36:42.617 --> 36:44.536
I do, too.

36:44.661 --> 36:46.163
Really?

36:46.287 --> 36:48.331
So do you think there's any way

36:48.456 --> 36:50.500
you could forget
that I said that?

36:52.669 --> 36:54.087
Said what?

36:59.009 --> 37:01.928
Can you bring me something
that will make me forget

37:02.054 --> 37:03.805
today ever happened?

37:03.930 --> 37:04.973
What's that shot
called, um..?

37:05.098 --> 37:08.018
A Mind Eraser.

37:08.143 --> 37:10.353
Two beers, please.

37:10.478 --> 37:12.105
You know, those
don't actually work.

37:12.230 --> 37:13.148
Yes.
Okay.

37:13.272 --> 37:16.860
I'm glad you're here.

37:16.985 --> 37:18.904
Yeah, I...

37:19.029 --> 37:22.407
I have to tell you
something, um...

37:22.532 --> 37:24.283
Oh.

37:24.409 --> 37:26.161
Thanks, man.

37:29.748 --> 37:31.583
(glass sliding)

37:31.708 --> 37:33.752
It hurt me,

37:33.877 --> 37:35.461
when you cheated on me.
Naomi...

37:35.587 --> 37:37.255
I told you,
I didn't cheat on you.

37:37.380 --> 37:39.257
Okay, you know,
she came on to me,

37:39.382 --> 37:41.093
and I rejected her
before you could
even...
Okay,

37:41.218 --> 37:43.178
okay.

37:43.302 --> 37:45.680
You don't have to convince me.

37:45.805 --> 37:49.559
Listen, hey, I know
I was a bad guy before,

37:49.684 --> 37:53.230
okay, but it is
so different with you.

37:53.354 --> 37:55.690
I've never cheated on you.

37:55.815 --> 37:58.902
(chuckles)
I haven't even wanted to.

37:59.027 --> 38:00.820
Okay...

38:00.946 --> 38:02.697
I've changed.

38:02.822 --> 38:05.825
(laughs)
Maybe you have.

38:09.871 --> 38:13.458
But I...

38:13.583 --> 38:15.252
I haven't.

38:15.376 --> 38:17.336
And...

38:17.462 --> 38:20.339
I believe you
about Holly, I do.

38:20.465 --> 38:22.592
It's just that

38:22.717 --> 38:25.887
it doesn't matter because
I know that I need to change

38:26.012 --> 38:28.640
and it...

38:28.765 --> 38:32.894
it doesn't have anything
to do with you.

39:02.007 --> 39:03.091
Thank you.

39:03.216 --> 39:04.550
Photo ID, please.

39:04.676 --> 39:05.718
Yeah.

39:08.138 --> 39:11.683
Oh, uh, this isn't my ID.

39:11.808 --> 39:13.059
This isn't my bag.

39:13.185 --> 39:15.520
There was a girl at
my party last night.

39:15.645 --> 39:17.647
She must have taken
mine by mistake.

39:17.772 --> 39:19.774
Well, the flight leaves
in about 20 minutes.

39:19.899 --> 39:21.067
I mean, can you call her?

39:21.193 --> 39:22.277
Is it someone you know?

39:22.401 --> 39:24.612
"Claire Hallenberg"?

39:31.036 --> 39:32.162
Um...

39:32.287 --> 39:35.040
No, I don't know her.

39:45.633 --> 39:47.552
Morning, handsome.

39:47.677 --> 39:49.179
Morning.

39:49.304 --> 39:50.222
(laughs)

39:50.347 --> 39:52.431
So...

39:52.557 --> 39:57.145
You said you wanted to live
every day to the fullest.

39:57.270 --> 39:58.521
Right?

39:58.646 --> 40:00.523
Mm-hmm.

40:00.648 --> 40:02.025
We've...

40:02.150 --> 40:04.652
jumped out of a plane

40:04.777 --> 40:07.322
and off of a bridge.

40:07.446 --> 40:09.490
(laughs)

40:09.615 --> 40:12.785
Today we have to do something

40:12.911 --> 40:14.704
even more amazing.

40:14.829 --> 40:18.124
Mm, well, I don't know
if that's possible.

40:18.250 --> 40:20.335
That was pretty hard to beat.

40:22.921 --> 40:25.840
Honey, you ain't seen
nothing yet.

40:29.761 --> 40:31.179
Hi.

40:31.304 --> 40:32.555
You ready for the park?

40:32.680 --> 40:34.391
We have an in at all
the best sandboxes

40:34.515 --> 40:36.309
in Beverly Hills,
don't we? Huh?

40:36.434 --> 40:38.561
Ooh, that sounds fun.

40:38.686 --> 40:42.815
Oh, it is so nice
to finally meet you.

40:42.941 --> 40:44.276
(giggles)

40:44.401 --> 40:47.028
Honey, want to draw? Yeah?

40:47.153 --> 40:48.029
Let's go over here.

40:48.154 --> 40:50.198
Here we go.

40:50.323 --> 40:51.408
There, sweetie.

40:56.913 --> 40:58.831
She is so beautiful.

40:58.957 --> 41:00.708
She has your eyes.

41:00.833 --> 41:03.711
Uh, thanks, uh, but
she's adopted, actually.

41:03.836 --> 41:04.963
Really?

41:05.088 --> 41:06.047
Wow.

41:06.172 --> 41:07.215
Yeah, it's no big secret.

41:07.340 --> 41:09.384
Leslie couldn't have kids.

41:09.508 --> 41:10.760
Yeah, we tried everything.

41:10.885 --> 41:12.511
Hormone shots, in vitro.

41:12.637 --> 41:15.014
None of it worked,
but then we got lucky.

41:15.140 --> 41:17.683
The birth mother was a local
girl, still in high school,

41:17.809 --> 41:20.061
and she just wanted her baby
to go to a good home.

41:20.186 --> 41:22.063
That's how we got Maisy.
