<i>Rip-Fixes-Sync
by VaVooM</i>

01:12.451 --> 01:13.477
Hi, Maggie!

01:18.883 --> 01:21.817
And a Merry Christmas party to you.

01:21.853 --> 01:23.152
Here.

01:23.187 --> 01:25.755
I spent far too long on the eggnog,
but it's even better than last year.

01:25.790 --> 01:29.792
Wait, you're producing a live televised
Christmas Special in less than a week.

01:29.861 --> 01:31.894
When does a head producer
find time to make eggnog?

01:32.163 --> 01:34.563
Hey, you want something
done, you ask a busy person.

01:34.632 --> 01:35.809
It tastes like a Christmas tree.

01:35.833 --> 01:39.234
Maggie!
Thank you for inviting us to this.

01:39.270 --> 01:42.439
I knew a Julia Wise office
Christmas party would be amazing,

01:42.506 --> 01:43.706
but I wasn't prepared.

01:43.741 --> 01:45.774
She has a Christmas tree in her office!

01:45.810 --> 01:49.078
- Now don't you wish you had one, too?
- A little, yes.

01:49.113 --> 01:50.279
Here.

01:50.348 --> 01:54.616
This is Stacy, our Associate Producer.
And this is Lucy Grace.

01:54.652 --> 01:58.387
She and her crew are doing a story based
on the new Christmas special format.

01:58.422 --> 02:01.190
- I watch your show every week.
- Thank you!

02:01.225 --> 02:04.171
And Maggie, thank you so much
for the sit-down with Julia.

02:04.195 --> 02:05.327
It went great.

02:05.363 --> 02:07.296
I was lucky I could even get you one.

02:07.331 --> 02:10.366
It's hard pulling her away from
her employees at a Christmas party...

02:10.401 --> 02:12.401
Because I don't think
of them as employees.

02:12.470 --> 02:13.936
We're more of a family.

02:13.971 --> 02:18.173
- Lucy, I forgot to give this to you.
- Oh... Oh, my gosh.

02:19.377 --> 02:23.045
I love your cookbooks.
My mom's going to be so jealous.

02:23.114 --> 02:25.092
We watch your Christmas
Special together every year.

02:25.116 --> 02:26.315
Never miss it.

02:26.384 --> 02:28.984
Again, doing it live and in
your own farmhouse in Vermont?

02:29.020 --> 02:30.452
That's a bold choice.

02:30.488 --> 02:35.257
It is, and it was Maggie's idea.
First year as our Head Producer...

02:35.292 --> 02:38.427
I have been following Julia's
lead for five years now.

02:38.496 --> 02:41.830
The idea was already there,
I'm just helping it along.

02:42.166 --> 02:44.599
Would you mind if we shoot
some office-party B-roll?

02:44.635 --> 02:46.946
Of course, and please stick around,
the party goes all day.

02:46.970 --> 02:48.370
Wouldn't miss it.

02:48.439 --> 02:49.671
There you go.

02:51.475 --> 02:54.743
Listen, swing by my office
after the production meeting.

02:54.778 --> 02:55.989
I have something
I want to run by you.

02:56.013 --> 02:57.779
Will do.

03:01.952 --> 03:02.952
Everything okay?

03:04.088 --> 03:06.455
Yeah, it's fine.
Come on.

03:06.490 --> 03:08.678
The special's in five days,
we still have so much to do.

03:09.827 --> 03:11.927
Wait. Just...

03:11.962 --> 03:12.962
Hey, Mom.

03:13.030 --> 03:16.198
Merry Christmas!
Well, a few days early.

03:16.233 --> 03:18.400
Honey, hold on a second,
your dad's right here.

03:18.435 --> 03:19.968
He wants to say hi, too.

03:20.003 --> 03:22.537
- Hi, honey!
- Hi, Dad.

03:22.573 --> 03:25.040
Let me guess.
It's December 20th,

03:25.075 --> 03:27.576
so you guys are almost done
making the Christmas cookies?

03:29.213 --> 03:31.046
Twice as many as usual this year.

03:31.081 --> 03:32.359
I'm giving them away
at the White Elephant.

03:32.383 --> 03:33.482
Don't tell your sister.

03:33.517 --> 03:37.085
<i>Honey, you know that
no matter how much we miss</i>

03:37.121 --> 03:41.490
having you home for Christmas this year,
we are so very proud of you.

03:41.525 --> 03:43.859
I do.

03:43.894 --> 03:45.494
And I miss you guys, too.

03:45.529 --> 03:47.462
We tell everyone who
asks what you're doing.

03:47.498 --> 03:49.664
<i>We can't wait to watch!</i>

03:49.733 --> 03:51.833
<i>...As promise
we are bringing you</i>

03:51.869 --> 03:54.736
<i>the Julia Wise Christmas Special
live this year,</i>

03:54.805 --> 03:56.104
<i>but fear not, because...</i>

03:56.140 --> 04:00.041
Hey, just make sure to call me during
the White Elephant exchange, okay?

04:00.077 --> 04:01.437
I love hearing how loud it can get.

04:02.279 --> 04:03.311
We'll do that.

04:03.347 --> 04:05.514
- Merry Christmas, honey.
- Merry Christmas, babe.

04:05.549 --> 04:08.316
Merry Christmas.

04:18.197 --> 04:19.221
Hey.

04:29.640 --> 04:34.676
It seems like a pretty serious
HR problem to have mistletoe around.

04:36.213 --> 04:38.380
We get a lot of emails
about mistletoe policy, yeah,

04:38.415 --> 04:40.816
...but not one problem.
We're very proud of that.

04:42.386 --> 04:44.853
You carry around a coach's whistle?

04:44.888 --> 04:48.056
Yeah, it's a Christmas present
from my dad.

04:48.091 --> 04:49.524
He was a football coach,

04:49.559 --> 04:52.727
so when I moved here to L.A.
he wanted me to have something for luck.

04:52.796 --> 04:55.797
- Does it work?
- Yeah, it's super loud.

04:55.832 --> 04:59.434
No, I mean does it bring you luck?

04:59.503 --> 05:03.371
I knew what you meant,
and... yeah.

05:03.440 --> 05:08.343
So, what brings you here
to Julia Wise Lifestyle Headquarters?

05:08.378 --> 05:13.615
I have a meeting with the lady herself.
About her Christmas special.

05:13.650 --> 05:15.183
She asked me to wait.

05:15.218 --> 05:18.987
Well, I work on the Christmas special.
Is there anything...

05:19.022 --> 05:21.322
I hear they're doing it live this year.

05:21.358 --> 05:24.426
Yeah, changing up the format,
getting a little more adventurous.

05:24.461 --> 05:25.794
Non-traditional.

05:25.829 --> 05:30.065
You know, like a traditional
Christmas special traditionally is?

05:30.133 --> 05:34.169
Well, no, not on my watch.
Year after year of the same exact thing?

05:34.237 --> 05:36.371
No.
No, thank you.

05:37.874 --> 05:39.754
I'm sorry, what did you say
your name was again?

05:41.778 --> 05:42.811
Sorry.

05:45.782 --> 05:48.016
- The boss.
- Good luck.

05:55.058 --> 05:56.058
Come in.

06:04.534 --> 06:06.701
Julia, are you...

06:08.038 --> 06:08.970
Are you okay?

06:09.005 --> 06:12.807
I'm great.
Just a little Christmas inspiration.

06:12.876 --> 06:13.876
Please, have a seat.

06:15.345 --> 06:16.911
Is this about the Teleprompter?

06:16.980 --> 06:19.848
No, I'm thrilled
about the Teleprompter.

06:19.916 --> 06:23.418
As hard as I've tried,
I just cannot memorize that much.

06:23.453 --> 06:25.887
Well, just personally,
I think you should just wing it.

06:25.922 --> 06:28.823
Just shoot from the hip.
You are so great at that...

06:28.859 --> 06:30.325
Maggie...

06:30.393 --> 06:31.904
And maybe next year, when
we do it, it can be more of a...

06:31.928 --> 06:34.829
This has nothing to do
with the Teleprompter.

06:34.865 --> 06:38.633
I had dinner last night
with the network President,

06:38.668 --> 06:41.035
and he has expressed some concern
about the live show.

06:41.071 --> 06:43.671
Concern doesn't... sound good.

06:43.707 --> 06:46.641
There's more competition this year.
Ratings need to go up.

06:46.676 --> 06:50.478
He just thinks it's too big of a risk.
Maybe just too big of a change.

06:50.547 --> 06:53.181
I mean, it's bold, I'll say that,
but all the more reason to change it up.

06:53.216 --> 06:55.049
And I agree.

06:55.118 --> 06:57.285
It's just...

06:57.320 --> 06:59.053
Okay...

06:59.089 --> 07:01.890
You know that right
after my husband passed,

07:01.925 --> 07:05.293
my son, Danny, produced the Christmas
special for the first two years.

07:05.328 --> 07:10.765
Yes, the mysterious Danny Wise years.
I started right after he left.

07:10.834 --> 07:13.301
Well, after last night's meeting,
I put a call in to Danny,

07:13.336 --> 07:14.669
I just wanted some advice.

07:17.140 --> 07:20.575
Well, you know, it's always great
to have new ideas.

07:20.610 --> 07:22.417
I mean, if you even
want me to talk to him,

07:22.546 --> 07:23.756
I'd be more than happy to do that.

07:23.780 --> 07:25.413
That's good news.

07:25.448 --> 07:29.184
Because I have asked Danny to come back
and work with you for this last week.

07:29.219 --> 07:34.022
It is not a demotion.
Co-Producers.

07:34.090 --> 07:36.068
I'm just a little worried with
this whole network pressure,

07:36.092 --> 07:37.392
and I would feel better if...

07:37.427 --> 07:40.195
No, Julia, don't even think twice, okay?

07:40.230 --> 07:42.964
It is going to work best
if you are comfortable.

07:45.168 --> 07:48.903
Thank you for understanding.
I know how last minute this is.

07:50.240 --> 07:51.124
Maggie...

07:51.907 --> 07:54.108
this is my son,

07:54.144 --> 07:55.443
Danny.

07:55.478 --> 07:58.847
You're... Danny Wise.

07:58.882 --> 08:01.783
- And you're the famous Maggie Baker.
- I am.

08:01.818 --> 08:04.719
I'm not famous. But yes Baker.
Maggie. Maggie Baker.

08:04.754 --> 08:05.854
Am.

08:05.889 --> 08:10.358
Maggie came up with the live show idea,
and Danny has some great ideas

08:10.427 --> 08:13.294
about, bringing in the more
traditional Christmas element.

08:13.330 --> 08:14.362
Right.

08:14.397 --> 08:15.730
Mom and I discussed this idea

08:15.765 --> 08:18.166
about having a few
pre-recorded segments.

08:18.201 --> 08:23.605
- Pre-recorded, in a live TV show.
- Well, we shoot some segments in advance.

08:23.640 --> 08:26.140
It allows us to cut away
to something exciting.

08:26.176 --> 08:28.443
More exciting than live television?

08:28.478 --> 08:30.511
Maggie, I know this
is not in the planning,

08:30.580 --> 08:32.340
but I do not see that
we have another choice.

08:32.381 --> 08:34.883
Well, then,

08:34.918 --> 08:37.852
if this is what we're
doing, then let's...

08:37.888 --> 08:40.455
let's make it great.

08:41.291 --> 08:43.191
I mean, am I crazy?

08:43.226 --> 08:44.503
It feels like Julia
doesn't believe in me.

08:44.527 --> 08:47.695
Of course, she believes in you.
She's just worried about the show.

08:47.764 --> 08:49.464
I'm worried about the show.

08:49.499 --> 08:51.611
I mean, have you ever actually
seen a problem be solved

08:51.635 --> 08:53.001
by adding more people to it?

08:53.036 --> 08:53.902
Tug-of-war.

08:53.937 --> 08:56.437
- What?
- Elections?

08:56.473 --> 08:59.140
Like, when you're in the line at
the bank, and more tellers show up?

08:59.175 --> 09:01.309
Okay, look, I just...
I agree.

09:01.378 --> 09:02.855
It'll be great for Julia
to have her son there,

09:02.879 --> 09:05.980
...and it'll be good for the show.
But it's just, it's late in the game.

09:06.016 --> 09:07.326
I mean, and do we even
know it's gonna work?

09:07.350 --> 09:09.050
Okay, you're spinning.

09:11.822 --> 09:13.047
Come on.

09:23.323 --> 09:25.533
Also, didn't Danny Wise

09:25.602 --> 09:28.870
produce the first two years of specials
when he was like 22,

09:28.905 --> 09:31.873
and then run off to go make
some nature films or something?

09:31.908 --> 09:33.308
Documentaries.

09:33.343 --> 09:36.744
Okay...
if we're going to work together,

09:36.780 --> 09:39.847
I think it's best that we avoid
sneaking up on each other.

09:39.883 --> 09:42.450
I tend to think out loud.

09:42.485 --> 09:45.653
That's pretty obvious.

09:46.590 --> 09:48.023
Okay, look...

09:48.458 --> 09:50.892
we can use these segments
to focus on tradition.

09:50.927 --> 09:51.960
People love that.

09:51.995 --> 09:55.296
The same pie recipe every year,
the Christmas ornament we all remember.

09:55.332 --> 09:57.699
Yes, and I agree that those
things are very important,

09:57.734 --> 10:00.034
but we are also on-air
in under a week, and...

10:01.404 --> 10:03.015
When you were an intern
at "Good Morning, Omaha,"

10:03.039 --> 10:05.707
you produced 10 Christmas
carol sing-alongs in three days.

10:05.742 --> 10:06.975
Yes.

10:07.010 --> 10:08.810
But I had an editor...

10:08.845 --> 10:12.191
You also managed to get backstage
at the Radio City Christmas Show,

10:12.215 --> 10:15.137
- ... interviewing none other than...
- Okay, so you did your research...

10:16.753 --> 10:20.355
But I guarantee you,
I didn't get any of that done

10:20.390 --> 10:23.157
by following
"ye old traditional rule book".

10:25.295 --> 10:26.828
Touche.

10:26.863 --> 10:30.665
- Okay, what's your idea?
- Well, off the top of my head...

10:31.701 --> 10:34.043
Everyone!
Can I have your attention?

10:37.073 --> 10:39.474
When I first started this company,

10:39.509 --> 10:43.277
I always said I was going
to run it like a family.

10:43.313 --> 10:46.814
And what our Christmas Specials
have done over the years

10:46.850 --> 10:50.251
is bring people that
perfect Christmas feeling.

10:50.286 --> 10:52.153
For me,

10:52.222 --> 10:56.824
my perfect Christmas
has always been my family,

10:56.860 --> 10:58.993
and that's what we bring
to our audience.

10:59.029 --> 11:01.574
Now, this year, we are doing
things a little differently,

11:01.598 --> 11:05.033
and by doing this show live,
I do know that several of you

11:05.068 --> 11:07.368
will not able to spend
Christmas with your family.

11:07.437 --> 11:10.872
But you'll be with us,
your work family,

11:10.907 --> 11:13.841
and that's why it is so important
that you really hear this.

11:13.877 --> 11:17.278
Thank you.
All of you.

11:19.249 --> 11:21.049
Now, can we eat, please?

11:23.086 --> 11:26.187
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

11:27.991 --> 11:30.425
I'll see you all in Vermont.

11:30.760 --> 11:33.628
"A Cross-Country Christmas".

11:35.031 --> 11:35.930
That's the idea.

11:35.965 --> 11:38.611
These pre-recorded segments should be
about places across the country.

11:38.635 --> 11:43.471
So the biggest family-owned
Christmas Tree farm, for example.

11:43.506 --> 11:47.141
We find unique, interesting places
that are doing cool Christmas things.

11:47.177 --> 11:49.310
Sure, if there was time.

11:49.379 --> 11:52.146
Well, we can have time if I start,
and you handle all the different...

11:52.182 --> 11:55.317
- Honestly, it's a great idea.
- Thank you.

11:55.351 --> 11:57.251
I'd also suggest
that more people would watch

11:57.287 --> 12:00.321
if you had, say,
a celebrity host?

12:00.356 --> 12:01.956
Exactly.

12:01.991 --> 12:06.294
Blend the new live show
with the, you know, traditional.

12:07.597 --> 12:08.996
Let's look into it.

12:09.032 --> 12:12.166
All right, Stacy and I will look into
locations, and you can find the crew?

12:13.870 --> 12:15.069
Deal.

12:19.943 --> 12:22.777
Okay.
I brought you three...

12:22.846 --> 12:24.879
of the biggest family-owned
Christmas tree farms

12:24.948 --> 12:26.114
between here and Vermont.

12:26.149 --> 12:29.484
Also, some Santa villages,
and a couple bake-offs...

12:29.552 --> 12:31.586
Are bake-offs getting old?

12:31.621 --> 12:33.588
Okay, so here's what's going to happen.

12:33.623 --> 12:36.858
I need you to help me find
Julia's sons, Derek and David.

12:36.926 --> 12:38.994
Wait, I don't understand.
Why?

12:39.028 --> 12:40.561
You heard Julia.

12:40.597 --> 12:43.397
Her perfect Christmas
is having her family there.

12:43.466 --> 12:47.568
What if I could convince them
to surprise her?

12:47.604 --> 12:50.037
You've seen
how hard Julia works, right?

12:50.073 --> 12:52.206
Yes, we have to make sacrifices
for this job.

12:52.242 --> 12:55.109
I haven't had a date in a year,
and I'm tired all the time,

12:55.145 --> 12:57.612
but can you imagine
what it's like for Julia?

12:57.647 --> 13:01.649
She shouldn't have to sacrifice
her family for this show, too.

13:01.684 --> 13:04.819
So you came up with a plan to go
crosscountry and collect them?

13:04.854 --> 13:08.200
- Why not just call them?
- Because this should be done in person.

13:08.224 --> 13:12.326
Plus, if I can convince her sons
to come along, everybody wins.

13:12.362 --> 13:14.929
- And you're not going to tell Danny?
- No. He's not an issue.

13:14.964 --> 13:19.033
He'll be in Vermont. If I told him,
he would just cause problems.

13:19.068 --> 13:21.670
Okay. I'm in.

13:23.006 --> 13:25.540
Just promise me that when
you're Julia Wise one day,

13:25.575 --> 13:27.208
I get to be your Maggie Baker.

13:27.243 --> 13:29.076
That has always been true.

13:29.145 --> 13:30.278
Okay, good.

13:30.313 --> 13:35.950
Now, you find where they live,
and I will plan the first shoot in...

13:36.019 --> 13:37.385
...Fort Collins, Colorado.

13:37.420 --> 13:39.620
The Gateway Pines Christmas Tree Farm.

13:39.656 --> 13:42.957
It's the third largest family-owned
Christmas tree farm in the country.

13:42.992 --> 13:46.027
We already reached out to the owners,
and they seem more than happy to have us.

13:46.062 --> 13:47.728
Why not the largest Christmas Tree Farm?

13:47.764 --> 13:50.965
Because if we go too large, we lose
the idea of something family-run.

13:51.000 --> 13:53.301
- Right.
- Right, that...

13:53.369 --> 13:54.902
That's what I was going to say.

13:54.938 --> 13:57.205
Okay, and you both think
this is the right thing to do?

13:57.240 --> 13:59.608
I do.
It's a good idea.

14:01.411 --> 14:03.289
Okay, well, I'll be on a plane
in the morning with the crew,

14:03.313 --> 14:04.356
everything will be handled
when I get there...

14:04.380 --> 14:06.692
You know, I have a lot of experience
getting segments like this, Mom...

14:06.716 --> 14:09.684
I agree, yeah.
Let's send Danny.

14:19.696 --> 14:22.029
Actually, I would like to supervise.

14:22.065 --> 14:24.098
I'd like to make sure
that these segments

14:24.167 --> 14:26.968
are still in keeping in
the spirit of the live show.

14:27.003 --> 14:29.437
While still having a traditional
Christmas feel, of course.

14:29.472 --> 14:33.207
Yes, but I am more than confident
that Stacy here

14:33.243 --> 14:36.611
can keep me posted from Vermont
while you all get settled.

14:37.580 --> 14:40.081
All right.
Go.

14:40.116 --> 14:41.949
Take a day or two,
make something great.

14:42.018 --> 14:43.818
Work as a team,

14:43.853 --> 14:46.354
and then I will see you at
the Christmas tree lighting,

14:46.422 --> 14:47.655
because that is our tradition.

14:47.690 --> 14:49.123
Will do.

14:51.194 --> 14:54.362
- Go. Make it happen.
- Travel safe, Mom.

14:56.266 --> 14:59.433
So, pack your bags...

14:59.469 --> 15:01.189
- And a jacket...
- And a very thick coat...

15:02.405 --> 15:05.506
- The less we do of that...
- The better, yeah.

15:32.669 --> 15:35.069
All right, so I did some
recon work with the owners

15:35.104 --> 15:38.506
on the phone earlier,
which are adorable, by the way.

15:38.541 --> 15:42.354
They said that we can shoot in the field,
but I'm thinking that we should also...

15:42.378 --> 15:45.313
- Definitely want get shots of this barn.
- Yeah.

15:45.381 --> 15:46.914
Hey, guys!

15:48.318 --> 15:49.984
Hold on.

15:52.655 --> 15:55.790
Don't come close.
I'm very sick.

15:55.858 --> 15:57.158
It came on suddenly...

15:59.729 --> 16:01.440
Okay, she gets credit
for being professional, but...

16:01.464 --> 16:05.366
But we all might catch a terrible flu.
We should warn the crew.

16:05.401 --> 16:07.702
No need. I am the crew.

16:07.737 --> 16:09.603
Wait, what? Just you?

16:09.639 --> 16:11.772
Just wait till you see
how fast I work

16:11.808 --> 16:13.874
before you go
and start passing judgement.

16:13.910 --> 16:16.677
Lucy, do you need any tea,
or can we get you something?

16:16.713 --> 16:19.814
I'm okay, I think.
It's just a really high fever, and...

16:20.950 --> 16:23.551
Whoa, whoa, hey, all right.
Let's go sit down.

16:27.457 --> 16:29.256
Feel better.

16:31.160 --> 16:36.464
Well, we just lost your celebrity host.
Scrap that idea.

16:36.499 --> 16:37.543
Head to Vermont and
let's shoot some segments.

16:37.567 --> 16:38.999
Wait, we don't need a host.

16:39.035 --> 16:40.412
There are plenty of ways
we could still get it.

16:40.436 --> 16:43.704
You want to shoot a series of
Christmas events across the country

16:43.740 --> 16:45.840
- ... without a host?
- Yeah.

16:45.875 --> 16:48.642
Point a camera at things
and hope for the best?

16:48.678 --> 16:51.445
Danny, I think I know what I'm doing.

16:51.481 --> 16:54.749
I've been doing this job for the
last five years after you quit

16:54.817 --> 16:57.118
and ran away to go make
PSAs for bears, or whatever.

16:57.153 --> 16:58.753
Documentary nature shorts.

16:59.789 --> 17:03.391
Okay, look.
Let me know what decision you come to.

17:03.426 --> 17:05.170
I will be by the car,
calling around for hosts

17:05.194 --> 17:07.361
who can work this close to Christmas.

17:13.903 --> 17:16.337
Hey, Stacy, how are you?
How is it going over there?

17:16.372 --> 17:18.705
The crew and everyone
made it to Vermont,

17:18.741 --> 17:21.175
and it's gorgeous here.

17:21.210 --> 17:22.454
<i>We're having rehearsal in a little bit,</i>

17:22.478 --> 17:24.478
<i>and Julia's making hot cocoa
to welcome us.</i>

17:24.513 --> 17:26.247
How are things going on your end?

17:26.281 --> 17:29.550
You know, we lost Lucy Grace,
Danny's being unreasonable,

17:29.585 --> 17:30.863
and if we don't get
the shoot started soon,

17:30.887 --> 17:33.098
I'm not going to have enough time
to talk to the first Wise brother,

17:33.122 --> 17:34.288
but other than that, fine.

17:34.323 --> 17:36.958
Whoa, Maggie!
Okay, take a breath.

17:38.895 --> 17:42.196
I know. I just, I need to think
what would Julia do in this situation.

17:42.231 --> 17:45.499
Maybe just consider what
Maggie Baker would do.

17:50.239 --> 17:51.839
<i>Let them tell their story.</i>

17:53.376 --> 17:55.910
You know what, you're right.

17:55.945 --> 17:57.945
I think I do know
what Maggie Baker would do.

17:58.014 --> 18:00.481
Thanks, Stace.
I'll talk to you soon.

18:04.287 --> 18:05.953
Hey.

18:06.022 --> 18:09.168
Okay, so...
maybe we got off on the wrong foot,

18:09.192 --> 18:12.106
but if you give me a minute,
I think I have an idea that will work.

18:13.062 --> 18:14.206
I have a feeling there's
going to be a lot of these.

18:14.230 --> 18:15.896
Okay, the sooner you choose to trust me,

18:15.932 --> 18:18.377
the more you'll find
I'm actually kind of fun to work with.

18:18.401 --> 18:19.401
Come on.

18:25.142 --> 18:26.441
Come on.

18:26.476 --> 18:28.610
So, you're the oldest Wise brother?

18:28.645 --> 18:31.279
Oldest brother, second to be adopted.

18:31.315 --> 18:32.414
Man, it's getting chilly.

18:32.449 --> 18:36.718
You and your brothers don't spend
Christmas together normally, right?

18:36.753 --> 18:39.287
Well, just diving into
the personal questions.

18:39.323 --> 18:41.690
I don't mean to pry.
Your mom, she...

18:41.758 --> 18:44.759
She's the master of Christmas decoration
and baked goods, yeah.

18:44.795 --> 18:46.261
Yes, actually.

18:46.296 --> 18:48.029
Stupid zipper...

18:48.065 --> 18:51.266
Look, we just like our Christmases
the old-fashioned way,

18:51.301 --> 18:53.401
and by that I mean
not around all the show biz.

18:53.437 --> 18:56.838
I like stockings hung by the fire,

18:56.873 --> 18:59.441
picking out a Christmas tree
on a certain day...

19:01.411 --> 19:04.112
- And what's wrong with that?
- Nothing!

19:04.181 --> 19:06.181
I mean, nothing's wrong with that.

19:06.216 --> 19:10.952
It's just if you adhere too closely,
where's the room for adventure?

19:10.988 --> 19:13.221
Christmas doesn't need to happen
on a particular schedule

19:13.256 --> 19:15.256
in order for it to be a good one.

19:15.325 --> 19:17.503
And that's why you're here
shooting a Christmas special

19:17.527 --> 19:18.994
instead of being with your family?

19:19.029 --> 19:20.462
Yeah, kind of.

19:21.965 --> 19:25.200
The first year the Christmas
special came out, which...

19:25.235 --> 19:27.869
you produced it...
quite well, actually...

19:27.938 --> 19:29.504
Thank you.

19:29.573 --> 19:31.539
My family had two girls in college,

19:31.575 --> 19:33.742
and there wasn't a lot of money
to fly home,

19:33.777 --> 19:36.444
so I spent it in the dorms
with some other people,

19:36.480 --> 19:38.413
and on Christmas Eve,

19:38.448 --> 19:42.350
the Julia Wise Christmas Special
came on, kept us all company.

19:43.387 --> 19:46.655
That was a really powerful thing,

19:46.690 --> 19:49.457
so when I graduated,
I went to work for your mom.

19:49.493 --> 19:51.760
I think that what she does
is really important.

19:51.795 --> 19:53.361
It helps people.

19:54.464 --> 19:58.333
Welcome to Gateway Pines,
and a Merry Christmas to you both.

19:58.402 --> 20:02.103
- Hi. I'm Claire Matthews.
- Hi!

20:02.172 --> 20:04.472
I'm Maggie Baker.
We spoke on the phone.

20:04.508 --> 20:05.774
Yes!

20:05.809 --> 20:07.553
So how's the television
magic going out there?

20:07.577 --> 20:09.444
We were wondering

20:09.479 --> 20:12.580
if you would be interested in doing
an interview for our segment,

20:12.649 --> 20:13.693
seeing that it's a family-owned farm.

20:13.717 --> 20:18.053
- Oh, no, that's not really what our...
- Now, Claire, let's not be hasty.

20:19.423 --> 20:21.890
My husband does one
production of "The Music Man"

20:21.958 --> 20:22.958
at community theatre...

20:22.993 --> 20:24.759
- I was good!
- And suddenly.

20:24.795 --> 20:26.461
Yeah, you were.
He was really good.

20:27.564 --> 20:29.330
That coat isn't heavy enough, son.

20:29.366 --> 20:31.246
That is what I said.
I told you to pack warmer.

20:32.169 --> 20:33.246
Come on, let's get you folks a tree.

20:33.270 --> 20:34.270
Let me grab my gear.

20:37.574 --> 20:41.209
Interviewed by whom?
We don't have a host.

20:41.244 --> 20:43.745
You said you've watched
my segments from the past.

20:43.780 --> 20:47.549
- You did your research, right?
- Yeah, there's a lot of 'em. So?

20:47.584 --> 20:49.918
Did you ever once hear my voice?
Or see me in any of them?

20:51.154 --> 20:53.766
Exactly.
You get people talking enough,

20:53.790 --> 20:57.092
the segments just sort
of host themselves. You'll see.

20:57.127 --> 20:58.827
You ever cut your own tree?

20:58.862 --> 21:00.829
I've done it with my folks,
but never on my own.

21:00.864 --> 21:03.798
- What about you, young man?
- No, sir.

21:03.834 --> 21:05.900
I'm usually traveling for Christmas.

21:05.936 --> 21:08.970
His mom does miraculous
things with trees, though.

21:09.005 --> 21:11.627
I mean, her trees were in magazines
before she even owned her own magazine.

21:12.609 --> 21:14.242
How long have
you two been married?

21:17.147 --> 21:19.848
No, no...

21:19.883 --> 21:22.450
- And you're not dating?
- No, ma'am...

21:25.188 --> 21:27.789
Now, what you wanna know
about looking for a tree...

21:27.824 --> 21:32.761
Now, don't shake the tree, needles
will always fall off if you do that.

21:32.796 --> 21:36.331
You want to put your hand
on a branch, and give it a glide.

21:36.366 --> 21:40.101
If needles come off, then move on.

21:40.137 --> 21:42.137
Now, I hope you measured your house.

21:42.205 --> 21:43.938
That's a problem we get...

21:44.007 --> 21:45.740
How long have you guys
been out here?

21:45.809 --> 21:48.143
The farm's been in Matt's family
all his life,

21:48.178 --> 21:50.945
and I married in about 25 years ago.

21:50.981 --> 21:55.350
Since then, we've been partners
in business as well as in life.

21:55.385 --> 21:57.318
Now, Maggie, come over here.

21:57.354 --> 21:58.486
You want...

21:58.522 --> 22:01.756
I mean, I don't...
I don't know about this.

22:03.460 --> 22:05.360
It's easier than it looks.

22:05.395 --> 22:07.529
Now, when you swing the axe,

22:07.597 --> 22:11.266
you want to make sure that
nobody's arms are near you.

22:11.301 --> 22:12.500
That makes sense.

22:12.536 --> 22:14.256
- Yeah, that sounds about right.
- Good tip.

22:15.472 --> 22:17.472
Okay, Matt,
stop torturing these people.

22:17.507 --> 22:21.776
I'm just kidding.
We don't use axes anymore.

22:21.845 --> 22:23.711
But you're a really good sport.

22:23.747 --> 22:27.282
Most people just panic
when I tell them to swing an axe.

22:28.718 --> 22:29.884
Wait!

22:31.521 --> 22:33.996
Oh, no, you didn't...
you didn't have to cut it.

22:34.024 --> 22:35.334
Sorry, I should have been more clear.

22:35.358 --> 22:38.293
We have a rental car,
so we can't bring a tree with us.

22:38.361 --> 22:41.062
You see the sign?

22:44.201 --> 22:45.667
Okay.

22:45.735 --> 22:48.369
I guess we got ourselves
a Christmas tree.

22:48.405 --> 22:50.104
Ho, ho, ho.

22:50.173 --> 22:51.906
Thank you.

22:51.975 --> 22:53.708
- You're very welcome, son.
- You too.

22:57.915 --> 23:00.226
I just got some great
extra footage of those two.

23:00.250 --> 23:01.649
- Yeah?
- So sweet.

23:01.685 --> 23:04.900
- You need some help?
- What, it doesn't look like I have it?

23:05.589 --> 23:06.888
You got it?

23:06.923 --> 23:09.691
Hey, we gotta get going,
so if you don't mind not doing

23:09.726 --> 23:13.928
one of your carefully planned set-ups
that slows us down so much?

23:13.964 --> 23:15.897
As long as you keep it spontaneous

23:15.932 --> 23:18.900
by suddenly throwing two old
sweet people into the mix.

23:18.969 --> 23:20.435
You're welcome for that,
by the way.

23:20.470 --> 23:21.669
Thank you.

23:23.140 --> 23:25.073
I mean it.

23:25.108 --> 23:26.608
They were great.

23:26.676 --> 23:29.478
It's gonna be a good segment.
You were right.

23:31.648 --> 23:33.214
You're welcome.

23:33.250 --> 23:35.250
I just...

23:35.285 --> 23:37.051
I want your mom
to have a great show,

23:37.087 --> 23:38.464
and I want the audience
to love it, and I want...

23:38.488 --> 23:41.589
The same things that I want.

23:41.625 --> 23:44.459
So we both want
what's best for your mom.

23:46.997 --> 23:47.997
Truce?

23:50.667 --> 23:51.733
Truce.

23:51.768 --> 23:54.435
- All right, we gotta get going.
- To the airport?

23:54.504 --> 23:55.882
I'm pretty sure
we're still ahead of schedule.

23:55.906 --> 23:58.172
Well, extra shots.

23:58.208 --> 24:01.142
You know, snow, mountain,
majesty.

24:31.508 --> 24:35.777
Finished.
Perfect timing.

24:35.812 --> 24:37.979
I'll upload it when
we get to the airport.

24:40.116 --> 24:42.684
Wait a second.

24:42.719 --> 24:46.487
- I know this place.
- Yeah?

24:46.523 --> 24:48.122
Strange.

24:52.095 --> 24:54.162
Hi. Excuse me, I was wondering
if you could help me find...

24:54.197 --> 24:57.632
- Derek?
- Danny?

24:57.667 --> 24:59.534
What are you...
What are you doing here?

25:00.937 --> 25:01.937
I have no idea.

25:01.972 --> 25:04.105
You're Derek Wise.

25:04.140 --> 25:06.361
- Third born. Third adopted.
- Yeah, best hair, best smile.

25:07.310 --> 25:09.989
- I'm sorry, what?
- Nah, it's a joke my brothers do.

25:10.013 --> 25:12.447
- What's going on?
- I'm Maggie Baker.

25:12.482 --> 25:14.226
I'm producing your mom's
Christmas special this year.

25:14.250 --> 25:17.585
- I was wondering if you would...
- Wait, you planned this?

25:17.620 --> 25:18.886
I can explain.

25:18.922 --> 25:22.056
I now have two
of the three Wise Men.

25:22.125 --> 25:24.792
I wanted to extend an invite for you
to come to your mom's show this...

25:24.828 --> 25:28.062
No.
Thanks, but very much not interested.

25:28.098 --> 25:29.397
Sorry.

25:32.702 --> 25:34.068
Hungry?

25:34.104 --> 25:36.771
- And your plan was to...
- Look, I can explain.

25:36.840 --> 25:38.706
Just let's get through dinner.
I'm buying...

25:38.742 --> 25:41.042
- No...
- Steak?

25:41.111 --> 25:42.577
- Fine.
- Okay.

25:52.791 --> 25:55.892
And you didn't think to ask
anybody in advance?

25:55.961 --> 25:57.305
All right, the first rule
of getting things done is

25:57.329 --> 26:00.329
it's easier to ask for forgiveness
than permission.

26:00.364 --> 26:04.633
Why don't you guys want to
spend Christmas with each other?

26:04.669 --> 26:07.269
- You don't give up easily, do you?
- Never once, no.

26:07.305 --> 26:08.437
Never do.

26:11.476 --> 26:14.910
My brothers have been upset
by the Christmas special

26:14.946 --> 26:16.579
since the first year of the show.

26:16.614 --> 26:19.048
We get along fine all year long,

26:19.083 --> 26:21.817
but then Christmas comes along,
and things take a turn.

26:21.853 --> 26:23.652
We just don't spend it together.

26:25.323 --> 26:27.189
Okay, here we go.

26:27.225 --> 26:29.992
Maybe I still have this...

26:30.662 --> 26:31.962
Yup.

26:42.173 --> 26:43.939
Yeah.

26:43.975 --> 26:46.242
He was 16.

26:46.277 --> 26:49.979
He wanted to sing
on the first year of mom's show,

26:50.014 --> 26:53.783
which I was producing,
and I said no.

26:53.818 --> 26:58.654
- As you can imagine, that didn't go well.
- Yeah, I can imagine.

26:58.689 --> 26:59.989
I hurt his feelings.

27:00.024 --> 27:04.293
Since then, neither one of my brothers
wants anything to do with the Special.

27:04.362 --> 27:05.661
I was just trying to protect him.

27:05.696 --> 27:09.098
- Well, have you told him that?
- No.

27:09.133 --> 27:10.966
We don't... we don't talk
about that stuff.

27:11.002 --> 27:14.904
Brothers just...
don't talk about feelings.

27:14.939 --> 27:16.806
Okay.

27:16.841 --> 27:19.041
And what about you, huh?

27:19.110 --> 27:21.477
I don't see you spending
Christmas with the Bakers.

27:21.546 --> 27:25.014
- Where are they?
- Hitchens, Nebraska.

27:25.049 --> 27:28.184
And my family is crazy about Christmas.

27:28.219 --> 27:30.586
I mean, they do it great.

27:30.621 --> 27:34.356
But, they understand that I'm working.

27:40.798 --> 27:43.899
Excuse me,
what's happening out there?

27:43.935 --> 27:45.735
That's the resort's
annual snowman relay.

27:47.138 --> 27:48.571
Really?

27:48.906 --> 27:54.877
Have you guys considered ever filming it
for, say, a Christmas special segment?

27:54.945 --> 27:58.547
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
No, no, no, we've got to hit the road.

27:58.582 --> 28:01.016
And a snowman relay?
What even is that?

28:01.051 --> 28:02.184
Well...

28:02.219 --> 28:04.119
You build a snowman in one place,

28:04.155 --> 28:06.455
and then you roll each
piece over to the next place.

28:06.490 --> 28:08.290
In teams.

28:08.359 --> 28:11.960
- What does the winner get?
- The satisfaction of a wellbuilt snowman.

28:17.101 --> 28:20.869
Okay.
But I need you to get permission...

28:20.905 --> 28:23.372
Yup! Doing it.

28:26.977 --> 28:29.711
Okay, I didn't mean
to be rude before.

28:29.747 --> 28:31.780
I'm sorry, it's just my last day
before vacation,

28:31.815 --> 28:33.093
and I didn't expect
to see Danny here...

28:33.117 --> 28:35.384
No, no, no, I'm sorry,
I was being pushy.

28:35.419 --> 28:37.719
And, you know, we were
just passing through...

28:38.889 --> 28:43.759
Okay, I... orchestrated
us passing through.

28:43.794 --> 28:46.094
There's no way
you'll come with us?

28:49.033 --> 28:53.235
So we started having this relay
as a way to keep the kids entertained.

28:53.270 --> 28:55.270
From there, we just kept it going.

28:55.306 --> 28:58.307
That was...
everything we needed, Erin.

28:58.342 --> 29:01.677
- Thank you, that was perfect.
- No problem.

29:03.080 --> 29:05.447
Let me say goodbye to Derek,
and we'll get on the road.

29:05.516 --> 29:06.660
I thought you were forming a team.

29:06.684 --> 29:08.384
- You have to choose a team name.
- Yes.

29:08.452 --> 29:10.753
What? No...
No, no, thank you, but...

29:10.788 --> 29:14.289
We will do...
"Thumpity Thump Thump".

29:14.358 --> 29:15.757
That's a good one.

29:18.128 --> 29:19.168
What are the other names?

29:19.196 --> 29:22.576
No, I mean...
We don't have time for this.

29:22.600 --> 29:26.168
Well, no, you do need a third person
in order to form your own team.

29:26.203 --> 29:29.671
- We have a third person.
- We do?

29:29.740 --> 29:31.873
I just finished my last
shift before break, anyway.

29:31.909 --> 29:34.176
Okay, don't get mad, but
Derek and I made a bet

29:34.211 --> 29:36.044
that if I could get you to participate
in the snowman relay,

29:36.113 --> 29:37.446
he will come with us.

29:37.481 --> 29:39.414
- Yeah, but we also have to win.
- There is that, too.

29:39.450 --> 29:40.450
So...

29:42.586 --> 29:44.419
Okay...

29:44.488 --> 29:47.990
When I say go,
you will all build your snowman.

29:48.025 --> 29:51.371
Once it's complete, raise your hands...
and I'll bring you a carrot,

29:51.395 --> 29:54.696
and then disassemble your snowman,
and roll it,

29:54.732 --> 29:57.432
one piece at time,
over to these targets.

29:57.468 --> 30:00.636
The first two teams
to put their snowman back together

30:00.704 --> 30:02.772
advance to the next round.
Okay?

30:02.806 --> 30:03.972
Yes!

30:04.008 --> 30:05.474
You ready?

30:05.509 --> 30:08.543
Three, two, one!
Go!

30:10.381 --> 30:12.314
You get a small...
Roll it in a small...

30:12.349 --> 30:15.183
There's not going to be enough...
And then it gets bigger...

30:15.252 --> 30:17.085
- No, first, you... Whoa!
- How did you do that?

30:17.121 --> 30:19.220
I just did it, instead of
arguing about how to do it.

30:19.256 --> 30:20.222
Have you guys tried that maybe?

30:20.257 --> 30:23.058
Okay, well...
I'll get this snow.

30:23.127 --> 30:25.327
You know, this is a lot of effort
just to impress a girl.

30:25.362 --> 30:28.597
Hey, cool it, all right?
We just work together.

30:28.632 --> 30:31.566
Really, because your hair looks good,
and... you're wearing cologne.

30:31.635 --> 30:32.868
Don't think I can't smell it.

30:32.936 --> 30:35.003
- Don't smell me...
- It smells good, though.

30:35.072 --> 30:38.774
Look, I know this Christmas special
has always been a thing for us, okay,

30:38.842 --> 30:40.153
and I know you spend
the holidays with David, so...

30:40.177 --> 30:42.412
Okay, can we not talk a
bout this right now? Please?

30:48.652 --> 30:51.853
Okay, guys, ready, ready?
Carrot! Carrot!

30:51.889 --> 30:53.789
- Another team ready?
- Carrot...

30:53.824 --> 30:56.024
- All right.
- Take it!

30:56.060 --> 30:57.704
Roll it to the other side.
Go, go, go, go, go!

30:57.728 --> 30:58.994
Go, Danny, go!

30:59.029 --> 31:00.729
Why is this so important to you?

31:00.798 --> 31:02.309
Because your mom
has been so good to me.

31:02.333 --> 31:05.067
And she works every Christmas,
and she gives it her all.

31:05.102 --> 31:07.269
Doesn't she deserve
a good Christmas, too?

31:07.338 --> 31:08.970
She really wants to see you.

31:10.107 --> 31:12.641
- Right, go, go!
- Go, go, go, go!

31:12.676 --> 31:14.587
Maggie, I really appreciate
everything you're trying to do,

31:14.611 --> 31:16.845
but my family doesn't
like surprises, okay?

31:16.880 --> 31:18.847
Okay, final piece!
Final piece!

31:18.882 --> 31:20.782
You are so much quicker
than Danny.

31:20.818 --> 31:21.683
- You gotta go!
- Maggie, go!

31:21.752 --> 31:23.452
Yeah, okay, okay!

31:23.487 --> 31:24.753
Push, push!

31:24.788 --> 31:26.822
- More.
- It's all you!

31:26.857 --> 31:29.191
- Take us home!
- Less leg!

31:29.259 --> 31:32.127
- A little help, guys?
- Should we help? I'll go help.

31:32.162 --> 31:34.062
Okay, come on!

31:34.098 --> 31:39.167
- Scarf! Scarf, scarf, scarf, scarf...
- Scarf, scarf, scarf, scarf, scarf!

31:39.203 --> 31:40.469
Yeah!

31:53.717 --> 31:56.151
Well, good effort, guys.

31:56.186 --> 31:57.786
But...

31:57.821 --> 32:00.155
a deal is a deal.

32:00.224 --> 32:02.357
Actually...

32:02.393 --> 32:05.293
I didn't really care
if we won or not.

32:05.329 --> 32:07.629
I just kind of wanted to see Danny
get his hands dirty,

32:07.664 --> 32:08.808
ruffle up his hair a bit,
with his cologne...

32:08.832 --> 32:10.298
You little...

32:11.702 --> 32:14.280
Plus...
I'm pretty sure if Dad was still here,

32:14.304 --> 32:16.538
he'd tell us to get over ourselves
and go see Mom.

32:17.808 --> 32:19.775
I'm sure you're right about that.

32:19.810 --> 32:21.243
Yeah, well...

32:21.278 --> 32:23.311
you're not going to convince
David to come, but...

32:24.481 --> 32:26.181
Well, it might not matter.

32:26.250 --> 32:28.094
They're definitely closing
the airports tonight.

32:28.118 --> 32:31.186
- How do you know that?
- I've seen it before.

32:31.221 --> 32:32.988
You can try to book a ticket,

32:33.023 --> 32:36.892
or we can stay ahead of the storm by
driving east to the next major airport.

32:36.927 --> 32:38.327
It'd take all night,
but it's Omaha.

32:39.797 --> 32:42.330
- That's the plan.
- Wait, but it's six hours away.

32:42.366 --> 32:46.301
- And your point?
- My point is... let's go.

33:04.154 --> 33:06.254
I'll pay any price

33:06.290 --> 33:10.325
to the first person
that brings me a bucket of coffee.

33:10.360 --> 33:11.726
Where are we?

33:25.542 --> 33:28.911
- Good morning, sleepyhead!
- What?

33:30.881 --> 33:33.648
- Maggie!
- Mom?

33:33.717 --> 33:35.851
How are you here?

33:35.886 --> 33:40.255
I... honestly have no idea.

33:40.290 --> 33:43.792
We outran the storm...
... then we saw Hitchens,

33:43.861 --> 33:47.229
and we thought, "Hmm, man,
if her family is that into Christmas,

33:47.297 --> 33:48.777
we have just got
to see it ourselves".

33:49.533 --> 33:51.066
And you guys
didn't wake me up to ask?

33:51.101 --> 33:52.934
How does that go...

33:52.970 --> 33:57.405
it's better to ask forgiveness
rather than permission.

33:59.176 --> 34:01.910
- Mom, Dad!
- Sweetheart, don't slip.

34:06.584 --> 34:10.886
- How is that you're here?
- Seriously, again, I have no idea.

34:11.855 --> 34:13.021
Hi!

34:13.090 --> 34:14.822
I missed you!

34:14.891 --> 34:16.925
Hi. Danny Wise.

34:16.960 --> 34:18.071
- Nice to meet you.
- This is my brother, Derek.

34:18.094 --> 34:19.561
Hi. Merry Christmas.

34:19.630 --> 34:20.495
- Nice to meet you.
- Derek. Hi.

34:20.531 --> 34:21.996
I work with Maggie.

34:22.032 --> 34:25.734
I'm Kate, Maggie's sister.
Mom, these are Julia Wise's sons.

34:25.768 --> 34:28.235
Okay, guys, let's not
make a big deal about it.

34:28.304 --> 34:32.774
It turns out that Maggie loves
surprising people with family,

34:32.809 --> 34:34.275
so we thought we'd return the favor.

34:34.311 --> 34:36.545
Well, you're just in time
for the White Elephant.

34:37.547 --> 34:38.780
White Elephant?

34:38.815 --> 34:39.926
It's a gift exchange party game,

34:39.949 --> 34:41.630
and nobody does it better
than our parents.

34:42.985 --> 34:43.784
Has anyone ever filmed it?

34:43.853 --> 34:46.254
You brought a tree?

34:46.322 --> 34:47.856
That...

34:47.891 --> 34:49.791
Yes!

34:49.826 --> 34:51.893
That is for you guys.

34:51.929 --> 34:56.164
That's our Maggie,
keeping us on our toes!

34:56.199 --> 34:57.566
Come on in.

34:57.601 --> 34:59.834
- You hungry?
- Yeah, starving.

34:59.903 --> 35:00.947
There's tons of food, come in.

35:00.971 --> 35:02.470
- Hey.
- Hi.

35:02.539 --> 35:03.838
This is an ambush.

35:03.874 --> 35:06.441
So my family is fair game,
but yours is offlimits?

35:06.476 --> 35:08.009
That is different.

35:08.045 --> 35:10.223
Are you seriously thinking about
recording the White Elephant?

35:10.247 --> 35:13.014
I do think it could make
a good segment.

35:13.050 --> 35:17.619
- Danny, my family, they're not...
- Your family loves Christmas.

35:17.654 --> 35:21.122
Look, I won't film them
if you don't want me to.

35:22.759 --> 35:24.526
But look at this.

35:24.561 --> 35:29.064
This warmth and tradition,
you can't fake it on TV.

35:29.099 --> 35:31.844
If it were this easy to make,
I never would have left this show.

35:31.868 --> 35:33.234
Why did you quit the show?

35:33.303 --> 35:35.170
Hey... Are you coming in?

35:35.205 --> 35:36.282
'Cause your family
is starting that gift thing,

35:36.306 --> 35:38.740
and it's really intense in there.

35:39.977 --> 35:43.411
Look who's here, everyone!
Merry Christmas!

35:43.480 --> 35:46.114
Aunt Maggie!

35:47.250 --> 35:51.186
Oh, my gosh, you are so big!
You got so tall!

35:51.221 --> 35:52.554
Now I wish we brought presents.

35:52.623 --> 35:54.789
- Derek, right?
- Yeah.

35:54.825 --> 35:57.203
- Come with me.
- Go with my mom. She's got you covered.

35:57.227 --> 36:00.562
- Hi. Derek. Hi. Nice to meet you.
- Hi!

36:00.597 --> 36:03.832
I didn't think I was gonna get
to see you guys!

36:03.867 --> 36:08.203
Lois Baker's famous
emergency present cabinet.

36:08.239 --> 36:11.373
I don't know exactly what is what,
but one of these is a manicure kit...

36:12.943 --> 36:15.244
...There is a, amaryllis
that you grow from a bulb.

36:15.279 --> 36:17.379
This is just a gigantic box of candy,

36:17.414 --> 36:19.081
which, trust me,
will be the most popular.

36:19.150 --> 36:21.183
Okay, you just keep wrapped presents
for emergencies?

36:21.218 --> 36:23.252
Well, moms have to plan.

36:23.287 --> 36:25.665
I mean, what if something breaks,
or somebody brings a friend.

36:25.689 --> 36:27.589
Or a vegetarian.

36:27.658 --> 36:28.902
You know what's the most important

36:28.926 --> 36:31.760
is something that your mom says
every year on her Christmas special,

36:31.795 --> 36:35.063
"Let's just enjoy each
other's enjoyment," right?

36:35.099 --> 36:36.999
That's what makes Christmas
the most special.

36:37.935 --> 36:39.768
Who has an empty hand?

36:39.803 --> 36:42.604
Can you take these over?
Sally decorated those.

36:42.640 --> 36:44.439
Great. Whoa...

36:44.475 --> 36:46.375
This is bacon-wrapped dates.

36:46.410 --> 36:48.343
Here is some salami on spiced onions,

36:48.379 --> 36:50.279
which is incredible,
you should taste that.

36:50.314 --> 36:52.381
I'm a vegetarian.

36:52.416 --> 36:56.251
Well, then for you,
I have some veggies and dip.

36:56.320 --> 36:58.987
The Bakers are pretty good
at this Christmas thing, huh?

36:59.023 --> 37:02.658
Yeah, we're pretty lucky like that.

37:02.693 --> 37:05.494
Okay, let's do this.

37:05.529 --> 37:09.598
Okay, I'm going to need your help
getting all the presents ready...

37:09.633 --> 37:12.401
- ... setting up for White Elephant.
- Yes...

37:12.436 --> 37:14.570
Okay, bring 'em on. Pile 'em up!

37:14.605 --> 37:16.738
I think I'll get the White Elephant.

37:16.774 --> 37:19.575
- You're gonna get it?
- I hope.

37:19.610 --> 37:25.217
Okay, hey, everybody, can I just...
can I just take a minute to say that...

37:25.649 --> 37:28.584
I am so glad
that I got to see you all

37:28.619 --> 37:29.885
a few days before Christmas.

37:29.920 --> 37:31.587
It's good to see you, too, honey.

37:34.692 --> 37:36.158
And...

37:36.193 --> 37:37.993
I can't believe I'm going to say this.

37:38.028 --> 37:43.999
I was wondering if you all would want
to be part of Julia Wise's Christmas...

37:44.034 --> 37:45.300
Yes! Definitely, yes.

37:46.971 --> 37:49.905
I mean... sure,
if you want.

37:49.940 --> 37:51.585
Just let us brush
our hair out first, and...

37:51.609 --> 37:54.543
- Go do your hair, Kate.
- Okay.

37:54.612 --> 37:58.614
Okay, act natural, you guys,
come on.

37:58.649 --> 38:01.461
Okay, get set up, and don't get too
much of my Aunt because she's got...

38:01.485 --> 38:05.621
Hey, don't worry.
I'm not going to embarrass anyone.

38:05.656 --> 38:07.756
Scout's honor.

38:07.791 --> 38:10.559
- You were a scout?
- I'm thinking about joining.

38:11.695 --> 38:13.128
Okay.

38:17.534 --> 38:19.001
Okay, remember the rules,

38:19.036 --> 38:22.237
you can either take a gift
from the pile or steal a gift.

38:22.273 --> 38:24.473
Now, if your gift is stolen,
you get the next turn,

38:24.508 --> 38:26.975
but every gift can be stolen
how many times

38:27.044 --> 38:28.110
before it is safe?

38:28.178 --> 38:29.111
- Two times!
- Two times!

38:29.179 --> 38:30.290
- Two, I think.
- ... Correct.

38:30.314 --> 38:32.481
Now, there are 17 people and 17 gifts,

38:32.516 --> 38:35.917
and, yes, one of them
is the famous white elephant.

38:35.953 --> 38:38.020
- Dad over here...
- I got it last year!

38:38.989 --> 38:40.188
Did you autograph it?

38:40.224 --> 38:42.357
I'm gonna break with tradition?
Of course, I did!

38:42.426 --> 38:43.426
Okay.

38:43.460 --> 38:45.861
- Now, does everyone have a number?
- Yes!

38:45.896 --> 38:47.863
All right, let's get started.

38:47.898 --> 38:49.731
Okay. Well, curiously,
I have number one.

38:55.606 --> 38:57.806
- I'll go with that one.
- No, no, no. That one.

39:16.894 --> 39:18.060
I want that.

39:41.485 --> 39:43.585
Number 10.
Who's 10?

39:46.824 --> 39:47.956
That's me.

39:47.991 --> 39:49.291
Here, yup.

39:49.326 --> 39:52.661
Now, you can either steal a gift
or pick one from the pile.

39:54.898 --> 39:57.199
Going for the gold!

40:07.911 --> 40:09.211
Very good.

40:12.750 --> 40:15.517
The elusive White Elephant.

40:17.621 --> 40:21.923
In his natural habitat.
Look at the prestige on him.

40:23.394 --> 40:26.929
That means you get to keep it
for a year and bring it next year.

40:28.265 --> 40:29.765
Does that mean I'm invited back?

40:31.435 --> 40:32.634
Potentially.

40:35.305 --> 40:39.107
Dad, here, let me help you.
I'll get more firewood.

40:39.143 --> 40:45.080
- I think that brings us to 11?
- Getting closer to the end.

40:45.149 --> 40:47.916
- You remember how to...
- I know, yeah. Dad taught me.

40:47.951 --> 40:49.952
You just point it...
Yeah.

40:50.921 --> 40:51.853
My turn.

40:51.889 --> 40:54.055
- Okay, superstar.
- Let's do it.

40:56.860 --> 40:58.927
Hey!
Come on, let me help you out.

41:03.700 --> 41:05.934
Your family, they are...

41:07.304 --> 41:10.705
- They're great.
- Yeah.

41:10.741 --> 41:12.874
I guess I've always known
how lucky I am

41:12.910 --> 41:15.510
having grown up
with Christmases like this,

41:15.579 --> 41:17.612
but somehow, it's even nicer

41:17.648 --> 41:20.749
getting to see it through
someone else's eyes.

41:20.818 --> 41:24.019
- It kind of reminds me why...
- Why you went to work for my mom?

41:24.454 --> 41:26.654
- Mrs. Christmas.
- Yeah.

41:26.690 --> 41:30.758
I get to share some of what I had
with people that maybe didn't.

41:31.294 --> 41:34.995
You should always get to spend Christmas
surrounded by people that you love.

41:35.031 --> 41:37.798
You should.

41:48.445 --> 41:50.646
- Hey, Mom.
- Julia.

41:50.680 --> 41:53.714
<i>Hey, we just watched
the Christmas tree farm segment.</i>

41:53.750 --> 41:54.916
<i>It's great!</i>

41:54.951 --> 41:55.951
Yeah?

41:57.020 --> 41:59.654
I uploaded the segment to Vermont
from the last resort.

41:59.689 --> 42:02.256
<i>Well, you two are doing
amazing work, really.</i>

42:02.292 --> 42:05.426
<i>I'd actually like to add more of
those segments if you can get them.</i>

42:05.495 --> 42:07.328
Are you sure?

42:07.363 --> 42:12.133
I mean, you guys are already rehearsing.
The plan... it'd be hard to change.

42:12.202 --> 42:13.267
<i>No, no, no, no, no.</i>

42:13.336 --> 42:16.437
Maggie gave us really good instructions,
so, you know, rehearsals are a breeze.

42:16.473 --> 42:18.840
Live show is great,

42:18.908 --> 42:22.154
but I just think if we add
more of these traditional segments,

42:22.178 --> 42:24.023
<i>everybody at the network
will be more comfortable,</i>

42:24.047 --> 42:27.315
<i>and honestly,
I'll feel a lot better, too.</i>

42:27.350 --> 42:29.617
Well, Julia, you are in luck.

42:29.652 --> 42:31.586
We are about to send you
another segment.

42:31.621 --> 42:34.689
It is Christmas party games
for families.

42:36.025 --> 42:37.925
That sounds good.

42:37.961 --> 42:40.394
<i>Just make sure you're back tomorrow
for the tree lighting.</i>

42:40.430 --> 42:41.662
<i>Great job, you two.</i>

42:41.698 --> 42:43.698
<i>- Bye!
- Bye!</i>

42:43.733 --> 42:44.765
Thanks, Mom.

42:48.705 --> 42:51.506
Well, it looks like the storm
is catching up to us,

42:51.541 --> 42:54.509
and if you want to try and pop in
on David, we should probably...

42:54.544 --> 42:57.745
Look, I know that this show
is changing a lot...

42:57.780 --> 42:59.080
No, it's fine.

42:59.115 --> 43:02.150
Really.
It's okay.

43:04.320 --> 43:05.320
Mag...

43:16.734 --> 43:17.734
Maggie!

43:18.303 --> 43:19.469
Hey.

43:21.707 --> 43:23.039
Here.

43:23.374 --> 43:26.108
Extra cookies.
Don't tell Dad. I took his stash.

43:26.144 --> 43:29.178
You swindled that
sweet old man for me.

43:29.214 --> 43:30.346
That means so much.

43:31.382 --> 43:32.815
Everything okay, by the way?

43:34.219 --> 43:36.452
You know when you work
really hard for something,

43:36.488 --> 43:41.023
and you get so close,
and then it's just...

43:41.059 --> 43:43.493
slowly pulled out from under you?

43:43.528 --> 43:46.863
- And you just start to doubt yourself?
- Not me.

43:46.898 --> 43:48.231
Everything I try goes perfectly.

43:51.136 --> 43:53.369
Maggie, I teach high school,

43:53.405 --> 43:55.016
and I had to keep their attention
all last week

43:55.040 --> 43:56.572
before they went
on Christmas break.

43:56.608 --> 44:00.276
So, yes, I'm familiar with
doubting my abilities at work.

44:00.312 --> 44:02.612
But I also happen to know

44:02.647 --> 44:05.815
the Baker sisters have an uncanny knack
for getting right back up.

44:08.687 --> 44:11.821
- You're the best.
- Love you.

44:11.890 --> 44:15.124
I love you, too.
I love you!

44:15.160 --> 44:18.561
- We'll be watching the special, kiddo.
- You better.

44:18.596 --> 44:21.431
- Merry Christmas.
- I love you.

44:21.499 --> 44:23.299
Merry Christmas! Bye!

44:23.335 --> 44:25.034
- Safe travels!
- Safe travels!

44:45.957 --> 44:46.923
Thanks.

44:46.958 --> 44:48.124
Why not just ask him?

44:48.159 --> 44:49.537
You know, say,
"Hey, free trip to Vermont,

44:49.561 --> 44:51.005
and all the free baked goods
you could possibly eat... "

44:51.029 --> 44:52.840
And that is the fastest way
to get him to say no.

44:52.864 --> 44:53.796
Yeah. David's tricky.

44:53.832 --> 44:56.099
- I am very persuasive.
- Yeah, she is.

44:56.134 --> 44:59.369
If you want to get him to come
with us, let us do the talking.

45:01.639 --> 45:03.506
Trust us.

45:03.575 --> 45:06.187
<i>...With that winter storm that has
already blown through the Midwest.</i>

45:06.211 --> 45:07.343
<i>For more on that...</i>

45:07.379 --> 45:10.213
<i>Thank you. Charles.
Rob McPherson here...</i>

45:10.281 --> 45:12.915
- Hi.
- Hi. How can I help y...

45:14.119 --> 45:16.186
- Surprise!
- Well, if it isn't Derek.

45:18.223 --> 45:21.491
- Good to see you.
- Whoa, what's going on?

45:21.526 --> 45:25.228
- Hey, look at this guy!
- How you doing, bud?

45:25.263 --> 45:26.263
Good.

45:26.331 --> 45:28.197
- Hey, bro.
- Hi.

45:28.233 --> 45:30.833
Maggie, I'd like you to meet
our brother, David.

45:30.902 --> 45:33.603
- First adopted. Second oldest.
- By far the smartest.

45:33.638 --> 45:35.505
And unquestionably kindest to animals.

45:35.540 --> 45:36.372
Handsomest.

45:36.408 --> 45:38.608
- I've said it for years.
- Top three, for sure.

45:39.978 --> 45:42.044
- Hi. I'm David.
- Hi.

45:42.080 --> 45:43.080
And this is Bradley.

45:43.114 --> 45:44.592
Hi. David and I own this place together.

45:44.616 --> 45:46.315
Hi, Bradley, I'm Danny.

45:46.351 --> 45:50.052
So nice to meet you both.
David, I work with your mom.

45:51.256 --> 45:53.950
And your brothers and I have been
on quite the adventure so far.

45:55.059 --> 45:56.826
They've even agreed to come...

45:56.861 --> 46:01.230
We've agreed to make some videos for
the upcoming Christmas special this year.

46:01.266 --> 46:04.400
Doesn't Mom's show air
on Christmas Eve?

46:04.469 --> 46:05.902
That's in, like, two days.

46:05.937 --> 46:09.305
Yes, and one of the things
that we're doing this year...

46:09.340 --> 46:13.376
We're traveling the country,
seeing different Christmas traditions,

46:13.411 --> 46:18.981
and... you see, Derek, he told us
about your annual puppy party...

46:20.251 --> 46:24.787
...and we thought it'd be a good
opportunity to make a video about it.

46:24.823 --> 46:26.522
Tell me more about this puppy party.

46:26.591 --> 46:30.092
We throw a Christmas party for
the rescue animals every year,

46:30.128 --> 46:31.394
and we have a great time.

46:31.429 --> 46:32.829
Okay.

46:32.864 --> 46:34.108
But I don't want to be
the one on camera.

46:34.132 --> 46:35.198
No, yeah, obviously...

46:35.266 --> 46:37.567
- Can't put that mug on camera, come on...
- Would you want to?

46:37.602 --> 46:41.571
Well... it'd put that
theatre degree to good use.

46:41.639 --> 46:44.140
I agree, let's do it.

46:44.175 --> 46:45.486
Yeah, he agrees, too.
What's his name?

46:45.510 --> 46:46.510
Murray.

46:46.578 --> 46:48.744
Murray. Okay, puppy party, Murray.
Puppy party! Bark, bark, bark!

46:48.780 --> 46:51.981
- Let's go!
- Puppy party for Murray!

46:54.586 --> 46:56.466
Okay, looks like we've
got everything we wanted.

46:57.922 --> 47:00.189
Any last tips you want to give us?

47:00.225 --> 47:02.492
If you're trying to get a good photo,

47:02.527 --> 47:04.627
where your pup makes that
cute sideways face they do,

47:04.662 --> 47:08.397
remember, a favorite or familiar toy
is your best bet.

47:08.433 --> 47:09.999
The squeakier the better.

47:18.276 --> 47:21.511
- That's good.
- Thanks again for letting us film this.

47:21.546 --> 47:25.214
- Your mom talks about you all the time.
- I know. I watch the special.

47:26.217 --> 47:29.118
- It's just a little too much.
- I get it.

47:29.153 --> 47:34.524
Traditions.
It's always nice to make new ones.

47:34.559 --> 47:39.495
Like, your mom, for instance,
she's doing the show live this year,

47:39.531 --> 47:42.131
and your brothers have
agreed to come set.

47:42.166 --> 47:45.735
- Wait, was this a set-up?
- A very well-intentioned one.

47:45.770 --> 47:48.137
And... and did they
convince you to help?

47:48.172 --> 47:50.940
Hey, I love spending
Christmas here, David.

47:50.975 --> 47:52.920
I love all our traditions
that we have on our own.

47:52.944 --> 47:56.212
Like, walking the dogs on Christmas Eve,
and the puppy party,

47:56.247 --> 47:57.525
and when Bradley and your friends
make that feast...

47:57.549 --> 47:58.681
Well, that's the plan.

47:58.716 --> 48:00.449
That's the tradition
you and I have made.

48:01.753 --> 48:03.419
I just figured maybe it was time

48:03.454 --> 48:04.965
we thought more about
what Mom wants on Christmas

48:04.989 --> 48:06.188
than what we want.

48:06.224 --> 48:07.890
Plus...

48:07.959 --> 48:10.159
I miss spending it with Danny.

48:10.228 --> 48:13.429
You guys have your own tradition.

48:13.498 --> 48:18.167
I get why... the way mom celebrates,
it isn't the way that you want to.

48:18.202 --> 48:21.437
I get it, and I would join you, I would,
I would, but that would mean...

48:21.472 --> 48:22.472
Yeah, we know.

48:23.741 --> 48:27.177
Mom would be alone on Christmas
while the three of us were together.

48:27.211 --> 48:28.945
That's not right.

48:28.980 --> 48:31.013
Look, Danny, I know
that we didn't ask you...

48:31.049 --> 48:36.268
Hey, hey, David, David...
Let's not rehash it. We're good.

48:37.121 --> 48:39.922
We got the footage we need.

48:39.958 --> 48:41.223
It's pretty simple.

48:42.327 --> 48:44.327
Come with us if you want.

48:44.362 --> 48:45.762
We leave for Vermont in the morning.

48:55.974 --> 48:58.975
I'll get some dinner
started for the dogs.

49:04.582 --> 49:05.915
I get that Mom's show

49:05.950 --> 49:08.384
is a big part of Christmas
for some people.

49:08.419 --> 49:12.688
- I love that about her.
- Then come to Vermont with us.

49:12.724 --> 49:14.023
After our dad died,

49:14.092 --> 49:18.227
this is how my mom processed it.
With work.

49:18.262 --> 49:22.765
It's not like we felt ignored.
Not once, ever, but...

49:22.800 --> 49:25.167
Christmas can be hard.

49:25.236 --> 49:28.704
You know, that's how she gets through.
This is how I do it.

49:28.740 --> 49:29.740
Here.

49:34.145 --> 49:38.247
Do you know why, in the Christmas story,
they call them wise men?

49:38.316 --> 49:42.084
Because they know what Myrrh was?
And where to find gold?

49:42.120 --> 49:45.087
And yes, and they were crazy
for frankincense.

49:45.123 --> 49:46.889
No...

49:46.924 --> 49:51.861
No, it's because they
changed their plans.

49:51.929 --> 49:55.231
They had been told to basically
go spy on this homeless family,

49:55.266 --> 49:59.602
and that was their plan, until
an angel visits them and says, "Hey,

49:59.637 --> 50:02.138
what do you guys think you're doin'?"

50:02.173 --> 50:06.275
And they realized that they
could change their plans.

50:06.344 --> 50:10.112
They were called wise
because they made the better choice.

50:10.148 --> 50:13.315
They sheltered a family away to safety.

50:13.384 --> 50:16.018
I'm just saying...

50:16.054 --> 50:18.688
plans can change.

50:20.258 --> 50:22.925
Yeah, I...
I think that...

50:28.466 --> 50:30.066
Special delivery.

50:30.101 --> 50:32.068
A good Samaritan found them in the park.

50:32.103 --> 50:34.970
Well...

50:38.443 --> 50:39.443
I'm sorry, Maggie.

50:40.211 --> 50:42.011
I belong here.

50:50.054 --> 50:51.020
Look at these guys.

50:51.055 --> 50:52.421
Yeah, there's four of them.

50:52.457 --> 50:53.522
Better get to work then.

51:03.101 --> 51:05.267
<i>...An unprecedented,
fast-moving storm</i>

51:05.303 --> 51:06.880
<i>that's going to give
a lot of New Englanders</i>

51:06.904 --> 51:08.938
<i>that White Christmas they dreamed of,</i>

51:08.973 --> 51:12.141
<i>rolling over the North East and
bringing airport closures with it...</i>

51:18.984 --> 51:22.752
You know, you two work well together,
you and Danny.

51:22.788 --> 51:27.223
Yeah, well, we've learned from the best.
Your mom is very generous with praise.

51:27.259 --> 51:28.692
It is easy to learn that way.

51:28.727 --> 51:31.461
Yeah, my brothers picked that up.
The generosity?

51:31.496 --> 51:34.397
Yeah, David takes care of the animals.
And Danny...

51:34.433 --> 51:36.733
did you know that he sends me
a box of food every month?

51:36.768 --> 51:40.704
He says he doesn't want me to starve,
and I tell him, "Danny, I'm doing fine,"

51:40.772 --> 51:43.606
and he's like, "Hey, it doesn't matter,
you're my little brother,

51:43.642 --> 51:44.882
here's a jar of peanut butter".

51:44.910 --> 51:48.778
- Do you eat it?
- Always. All of it, every month.

51:49.781 --> 51:51.514
That's sweet.

51:51.583 --> 51:53.783
All right, bad news,
the airport's closed.

51:53.852 --> 51:55.285
Good news,

51:55.354 --> 51:57.721
I got us tickets on a train
they think will get through.

51:57.789 --> 51:59.233
It leaves in a couple hours,
but we gotta go now.

51:59.257 --> 52:01.825
- What, do you mean, like...
- Right now?

52:01.893 --> 52:04.661
- No, I reject this alliance.
- It seems so urgent.

52:04.696 --> 52:06.029
- Super serious.
- Are you okay?

52:06.064 --> 52:08.999
That's us! Okay!
Yeah! Us! Thank you! Sorry.

52:16.775 --> 52:18.274
You know, for what it's worth,

52:18.310 --> 52:20.910
my mom's going to be really
excited to see Derek tomorrow.

52:22.180 --> 52:24.547
I hope so.

52:27.185 --> 52:30.286
Okay.
And on that note...

52:32.190 --> 52:34.724
Come on, let's go, let's go!

52:45.837 --> 52:47.971
<i>All passengers, your attention, please.</i>

52:48.006 --> 52:50.240
<i>The train will be delayed
until further notice.</i>

52:50.275 --> 52:51.652
All right, well, the conductor says

52:51.676 --> 52:53.488
that they're still clearing
the snow off the tracks.

52:53.512 --> 52:55.945
Should we rent a car,
try and get a cab?

52:55.981 --> 52:59.049
How far are we again?

52:59.084 --> 53:00.817
I still don't have any service.

53:03.655 --> 53:05.155
Derek, what are you doing?

53:05.190 --> 53:06.701
Well, even if we don't make it
to the tree lighting,

53:06.725 --> 53:07.869
we'll still make it to the show.

53:07.893 --> 53:10.026
- Let's shoot something.
- Are you sure?

53:10.062 --> 53:12.028
Asking people delayed from travel
is a huge risk.

53:12.064 --> 53:13.530
Watch.

53:13.598 --> 53:17.033
Hi, ma'am, how do you
feel about holiday travel?

53:17.069 --> 53:19.102
Anytime it snows near Christmas,

53:19.171 --> 53:23.206
we should all just stay home
and eat whatever we can find.

53:25.177 --> 53:26.109
Good advice.

53:26.144 --> 53:28.278
Merry Christmas.

53:28.346 --> 53:30.814
- Merry Christmas.
- Thank you.

53:31.983 --> 53:33.661
Okay, I was trying to
use her as an example,

53:33.685 --> 53:35.229
but that was great,
and I wish you were filming it.

53:35.253 --> 53:37.620
Yeah, me too.

53:37.689 --> 53:40.523
- Let's try that again.
- Yeah?

53:42.994 --> 53:44.060
Come on.

53:46.198 --> 53:49.899
Excuse me.
Can I get your names?

53:49.968 --> 53:53.136
- I'm Marissa, this is Joey.
- Hi.

53:53.171 --> 53:57.707
Hi. Would you guys mind talking to us
for our Christmas TV special?

53:57.742 --> 54:00.610
- Sure.
- Great.

54:00.645 --> 54:04.247
- Where are you folks headed?
- Well, we were going to Vermont.

54:04.282 --> 54:06.182
This train isn't usually as packed,

54:06.218 --> 54:08.384
but the storm has
everything all messed up.

54:08.453 --> 54:12.088
We just bought the last ticket.
One ticket, two people.

54:12.124 --> 54:16.259
Three if you count this little guy.
I say we'll be fine.

54:16.328 --> 54:17.994
Christmas is a time for miracles.

54:18.029 --> 54:20.430
You don't seem so worried, though.

54:20.465 --> 54:23.900
Everyone says Christmas travel
and delays are this huge hassle.

54:23.935 --> 54:27.237
But look around.
It's beautiful out.

54:27.305 --> 54:29.939
It's magic this time of year.

54:29.975 --> 54:33.543
<i>We are now ready to board
passengers at this time.</i>

54:33.578 --> 54:36.813
<i>Please have your tickets ready
and begin boarding, thank you.</i>

54:36.848 --> 54:40.550
- You folks have a good Christmas.
- Is there anything we can do to help?

54:40.585 --> 54:43.920
No, it's all right.
We'll figure it out.

54:43.989 --> 54:47.023
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

54:47.092 --> 54:50.494
- Maggie, I'll get them to sign waivers.
- Great.

54:53.498 --> 54:54.564
I feel so bad...

54:57.636 --> 55:01.271
Are you sure?
Oh, my gosh, thank you!

55:01.339 --> 55:05.175
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas! Thank you!

55:11.016 --> 55:12.182
Thank you!

55:12.217 --> 55:13.249
Merry Christmas.

55:13.318 --> 55:15.485
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

55:15.520 --> 55:16.520
So...

55:17.556 --> 55:20.256
- I did something.
- What did you do?

55:20.292 --> 55:22.692
I gave that couple my ticket.

55:22.727 --> 55:24.594
What about the tree-lighting ceremony?
Your mom?

55:24.629 --> 55:25.695
Yeah, Mom will be fine.

55:25.764 --> 55:27.598
She won't know she's missing me
any more than usual.

55:27.632 --> 55:29.199
Just... Just don't tell her.

55:31.670 --> 55:33.503
Now, will you guys all
get on the train?

55:36.308 --> 55:38.942
You Wise men...

55:39.010 --> 55:41.244
you're a complicated bunch.

55:45.383 --> 55:46.649
You...

55:46.685 --> 55:48.551
- Me?
- You...

55:52.724 --> 55:54.290
I'm proud of you.

55:57.028 --> 55:58.127
All right.

55:58.163 --> 56:00.508
- Now, eat something, will you?
- Yeah, I know, I know.

56:00.532 --> 56:02.832
- I snuck some peanut butter in your bag.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

56:28.259 --> 56:32.628
Mom's house is over that ridge.
It's too far to walk.

56:32.664 --> 56:35.933
- Stacy says our ride is here, but...
- No.

56:42.340 --> 56:44.640
You gotta be kidding me.

56:46.411 --> 56:49.145
We're taking the sleigh.

56:58.122 --> 57:01.657
You know,
the storm wasn't so bad.

57:01.726 --> 57:03.359
It was sort of fun.

57:03.394 --> 57:06.696
Yeah.
It was.

57:06.731 --> 57:09.198
And I learned some things.

57:09.267 --> 57:12.735
You're kind of good at your job.

57:12.770 --> 57:16.005
Even if I'm too traditional?

57:16.040 --> 57:20.176
I could use a little more
traditional in my life.

57:20.244 --> 57:23.379
We make a good team.

57:31.322 --> 57:33.022
I called around.

57:33.057 --> 57:36.136
You know that any of the volunteers
and I would be happy to help out

57:36.160 --> 57:40.162
if you want to go be with your Mom
and your brothers.

57:42.600 --> 57:43.766
Merry Christmas.

57:45.536 --> 57:47.169
Wh...?

58:01.019 --> 58:02.685
Okay.

58:05.823 --> 58:07.423
You made it!

58:09.260 --> 58:11.527
How are you?
How are rehearsals going?

58:11.562 --> 58:12.728
Rehearsals are good!

58:12.797 --> 58:14.797
Yeah, the only thing
that we didn't rehearse

58:14.832 --> 58:16.899
was cooking the Christmas goose
on live TV.

58:16.934 --> 58:19.902
- But hey, what could go wrong?
- We could pre-cook the goose.

58:19.937 --> 58:24.306
No, I'm fine. I'm kidding. Jitters.
I have faith in all of us.

58:24.342 --> 58:27.743
And... I have one of my boys
with me for Christmas.

58:27.779 --> 58:29.378
So, come on,
we have a tree to light,

58:29.414 --> 58:31.847
and I also saved you
some ornaments to put on it.

58:33.017 --> 58:35.951
Hey.
We made it.

58:35.987 --> 58:38.521
Yeah.

58:54.672 --> 58:56.305
- What a tree, huh?
- Right?

59:02.180 --> 59:04.880
I made that.

59:06.117 --> 59:07.183
Fourth grade.

59:10.188 --> 59:11.987
This explains our performance
in the relay.

59:15.793 --> 59:17.593
Can I ask you something?

59:17.662 --> 59:19.662
I saved these for you.

59:19.697 --> 59:20.697
Thank you.

59:21.833 --> 59:23.099
What are they?

59:24.769 --> 59:26.602
Your dad's favorite decorations.

59:27.739 --> 59:29.438
What?

59:29.575 --> 59:34.477
I put them away so many years ago,
but having you back, Danny,

59:34.513 --> 59:36.446
I figured I'd bring them out again.

59:36.481 --> 59:40.283
Oh, my goodness.
I keep meaning to send that to Derek.

59:43.188 --> 59:47.757
Their father would sing Christmas carols
and play that ukulele all Christmas Eve.

59:49.094 --> 59:51.995
He always said it didn't matter
if you could sing or not

59:52.030 --> 59:54.664
because Christmas carols
were for everybody.

59:58.770 --> 59:59.903
My pies.

01:00:06.044 --> 01:00:07.244
There you are.

01:00:07.279 --> 01:00:09.246
We should load your
segments into the server

01:00:09.281 --> 01:00:11.047
sooner rather than later.

01:00:11.116 --> 01:00:11.982
- Right.
- Yeah.

01:00:12.017 --> 01:00:13.416
I'm on it.

01:00:13.452 --> 01:00:15.986
And your room is in the guesthouse,

01:00:16.054 --> 01:00:17.265
and there's still
a few things to go over.

01:00:17.289 --> 01:00:19.689
- Do you want to do that now?
- Yeah, if that's cool.

01:00:19.725 --> 01:00:20.824
Yeah.

01:00:22.995 --> 01:00:25.395
Julia's a natural with
the Teleprompter...

01:00:25.430 --> 01:00:28.098
but I think next year,
we should convince her to just wing it.

01:00:28.166 --> 01:00:31.468
- She's more fun that way.
- And the crew is happy?

01:00:31.503 --> 01:00:33.136
Are you kidding?

01:00:33.171 --> 01:00:37.073
Maggie, when Julia says
we're a family, she means it.

01:00:38.510 --> 01:00:40.610
We went sledding and ice skating.

01:00:40.646 --> 01:00:44.881
This place is like a...
It's like a Christmas theme park.

01:00:44.917 --> 01:00:46.416
Yeah.

01:00:46.485 --> 01:00:48.985
And all the while,
her real family couldn't make it.

01:00:49.021 --> 01:00:50.487
Yeah.

01:00:51.590 --> 01:00:52.889
What happened with that?

01:00:52.925 --> 01:00:56.159
They've just, they've got so much
history surrounding Christmas,

01:00:56.194 --> 01:00:59.829
and I just stuck my nose
right in there, and...

01:00:59.865 --> 01:01:04.501
I don't know, I can't help wonder
if I made things worse.

01:01:04.536 --> 01:01:06.136
I'm sure you did fine.

01:01:06.171 --> 01:01:08.486
You tried,
that's the important thing.

01:01:09.574 --> 01:01:10.740
Come on.

01:01:10.776 --> 01:01:12.642
Let's go get you settled
in the guest house.

01:01:12.711 --> 01:01:13.743
- Ooh...
- Guest house.

01:01:19.117 --> 01:01:20.784
All right, gather around, everyone.

01:01:20.819 --> 01:01:24.054
I think it's time we light up
this Christmas tree, don't you?

01:01:25.457 --> 01:01:28.024
But first, a Christmas toast.

01:01:28.093 --> 01:01:32.929
To those gathered with us,
and to those gathered without us.

01:01:32.998 --> 01:01:37.834
To those less fortunate,
and those with the wisdom to help.

01:01:37.903 --> 01:01:41.371
Here's to the light
in each and every one of us.

01:01:41.406 --> 01:01:44.507
- Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas!

01:01:58.957 --> 01:02:00.557
How you doing?

01:02:00.592 --> 01:02:04.961
You know,
finally decided to shake off my mood.

01:02:04.997 --> 01:02:09.933
We always have next year
to convince your brothers.

01:02:11.803 --> 01:02:12.902
Okay, it's...

01:02:12.971 --> 01:02:13.703
It's okay.

01:02:13.772 --> 01:02:16.106
It's all good,
I've got this.

01:02:16.141 --> 01:02:21.745
Remind me...
to order some generators.

01:02:21.813 --> 01:02:23.947
I mean, if this were to...

01:02:23.982 --> 01:02:25.949
if this were to happen
during the show...

01:02:35.248 --> 01:02:38.395
- Generators it is.
- Yeah.

01:02:49.141 --> 01:02:50.440
Hey.

01:02:50.475 --> 01:02:53.143
I'm sorry.
I thought everybody went to bed.

01:02:53.178 --> 01:02:55.078
Oh, no, I think that they did.

01:02:55.113 --> 01:02:58.348
This is just the first quiet
in a few days.

01:02:58.383 --> 01:03:01.785
I'm just doing
a last-minute edit or two.

01:03:03.555 --> 01:03:04.854
It's coming down.

01:03:10.862 --> 01:03:12.128
What's that?

01:03:12.552 --> 01:03:17.313
It's just a collection of clips
that I'm not using, so...

01:03:17.642 --> 01:03:21.616
you know, sometimes, I like to cut
them together, make smaller videos.

01:03:21.640 --> 01:03:23.773
Well, let's see 'em.

01:03:23.809 --> 01:03:26.010
- They're not really...
- Let's see them.

01:03:27.179 --> 01:03:29.979
<i>Thank you for bringing Maggie home.</i>

01:03:30.015 --> 01:03:31.548
<i>It's the least we can do.</i>

01:03:31.583 --> 01:03:34.117
<i>I mean, your daughter spends Christmas
pulled into our mom's show...</i>

01:03:34.186 --> 01:03:36.486
<i>My daughter never gets pulled
into anything.</i>

01:03:36.521 --> 01:03:41.724
<i>Maggie is always exactly who
and exactly where she's supposed to be.</i>

01:03:41.760 --> 01:03:43.226
And how.

01:03:44.262 --> 01:03:46.996
<i>Look at her,
I am so proud of her.</i>

01:03:47.032 --> 01:03:49.999
<i>Boy, you must be proud
of your mom, too.</i>

01:03:50.068 --> 01:03:51.901
<i>Yeah, I am.</i>

01:03:51.937 --> 01:03:55.116
<i>It's just... Well, sometimes,
I wish that our family</i>

01:03:55.140 --> 01:03:56.818
<i>could find room for a Christmas
like this, you know?</i>

01:03:56.842 --> 01:03:57.842
<i>For all of us.</i>

01:04:00.312 --> 01:04:04.314
<i>Just remember...
it's a two-way street.</i>

01:04:08.386 --> 01:04:10.220
Danny, this is...

01:04:12.390 --> 01:04:13.823
...really great.

01:04:17.967 --> 01:04:20.314
I'm sorry, I thought
everyone had gone to bed.

01:04:21.166 --> 01:04:24.968
- Mom, you know, we're just...
- Some edits...

01:04:25.003 --> 01:04:27.904
But we have a show tomorrow,
so I'm gonna get to bed.

01:04:27.939 --> 01:04:31.541
No, no, actually, I'm the one
who should go and get some rest...

01:04:31.576 --> 01:04:35.078
- We should all get some rest.
- Yeah.

01:04:35.113 --> 01:04:40.316
But... after this show is said and done,
I already want to talk about next year,

01:04:40.352 --> 01:04:44.587
because the behind-the-scenes
segments that your son did

01:04:44.623 --> 01:04:47.524
are exactly the feel that we want
for next year's show.

01:04:47.559 --> 01:04:50.160
Well, I cannot wait to see them.

01:04:50.195 --> 01:04:51.806
Although we are going
to have to start thinking

01:04:51.830 --> 01:04:54.297
about getting a crew,
then, for next year.

01:04:54.332 --> 01:04:56.900
Why? We've got Danny.

01:04:56.935 --> 01:04:59.035
Well, no, Danny's not
going to be here next year,

01:04:59.070 --> 01:05:01.906
so we are going to need to look for...
I thought you knew.

01:05:05.310 --> 01:05:07.348
I agreed that this would be
a onetime thing.

01:05:07.446 --> 01:05:09.246
I have other jobs lined up.

01:05:09.266 --> 01:05:11.344
No, I didn't know that.

01:05:11.383 --> 01:05:14.217
Well, I should have been
a lot more clear.

01:05:14.252 --> 01:05:18.499
The network wanted what worked before,
and of course, I wanted to see Danny...

01:05:18.523 --> 01:05:22.225
Right, no, I mean,
that makes complete sense.

01:05:22.260 --> 01:05:24.294
I'm gonna head to bed.

01:05:24.362 --> 01:05:28.231
So have a good night, everybody,
and Merry Christmas.

01:05:39.945 --> 01:05:40.846
Maggie!

01:05:41.646 --> 01:05:42.519
Wait!

01:05:43.119 --> 01:05:46.190
- Look, I'm sorry I didn't tell you!
- Really, there's no point.

01:05:47.633 --> 01:05:50.420
Look, this is a good thing, ultimately.

01:05:50.455 --> 01:05:51.370
What?

01:05:51.457 --> 01:05:54.497
You won't have to deal with
somebody getting in your way.

01:05:55.527 --> 01:05:58.528
It gives you the opportunity to do
what you want to do with the show.

01:05:58.597 --> 01:06:01.197
An opportunity?
I've been doing this for years.

01:06:01.233 --> 01:06:03.666
It's not an opportunity, Danny,
it's my job.

01:06:03.702 --> 01:06:05.068
You know that's not what I meant...

01:06:05.136 --> 01:06:06.514
You know, a job that
I was doing pretty well

01:06:06.538 --> 01:06:11.708
until you decided to swoop in and
change things up, and you don't...

01:06:11.743 --> 01:06:13.977
I just...

01:06:14.012 --> 01:06:18.681
I started thinking that maybe
this was... a new way of working,

01:06:18.750 --> 01:06:22.051
a better way of working.

01:06:22.087 --> 01:06:26.422
Maggie, this week
has been incredible.

01:06:26.458 --> 01:06:27.924
Everything,

01:06:27.959 --> 01:06:30.893
the road trip,

01:06:30.929 --> 01:06:33.329
you and me...

01:06:33.365 --> 01:06:35.832
I like working with you.

01:06:35.867 --> 01:06:37.300
A lot.

01:06:37.335 --> 01:06:38.968
Me too.

01:06:40.171 --> 01:06:43.406
You know, I don't mean to be all...

01:06:45.844 --> 01:06:48.011
It's just that, you know,

01:06:48.446 --> 01:06:51.247
people tell me all the time
how independent I am,

01:06:52.628 --> 01:06:55.304
and I really like that
about myself, but...

01:06:58.857 --> 01:07:00.089
I also like you.

01:07:04.029 --> 01:07:07.964
- Maggie...
- You know what, Danny, it's...

01:07:08.033 --> 01:07:09.680
We have a job to do.

01:07:11.870 --> 01:07:13.202
Good night.

01:07:17.876 --> 01:07:19.309
Man...

01:07:33.260 --> 01:07:34.993
Merry Christmas!

01:07:35.028 --> 01:07:37.529
How did you know it was me?
That phone is ancient.

01:07:37.564 --> 01:07:38.930
I didn't.

01:07:38.965 --> 01:07:39.931
I've just always liked the way
Mom answers the phone,

01:07:39.966 --> 01:07:41.232
"Merry Christmas!"

01:07:41.268 --> 01:07:43.148
And at this time of year,
I picked it up myself.

01:07:44.671 --> 01:07:46.704
Well... what are you up to?

01:07:46.740 --> 01:07:48.317
Mom asked the kids
to come over last night,

01:07:48.341 --> 01:07:49.807
so I'm here making breakfast.

01:07:49.843 --> 01:07:51.476
What's going on?

01:07:51.545 --> 01:07:53.322
Is it that handsome camera dude
you rode through here with?

01:07:53.346 --> 01:07:55.880
- How did you know?
- I have eyes.

01:07:55.949 --> 01:07:58.417
And I was waiting for you to say
something before I asked.

01:07:58.451 --> 01:08:00.852
Kate...

01:08:00.887 --> 01:08:02.598
I let myself like someone
that I shouldn't have.

01:08:02.622 --> 01:08:05.123
Why?
Because you work together?

01:08:05.158 --> 01:08:06.024
<i>I thought that was it.</i>

01:08:06.059 --> 01:08:09.605
And now I find out he's not going
to be working with me much longer.

01:08:09.629 --> 01:08:11.362
But...

01:08:11.398 --> 01:08:13.531
I was sort of into the idea.

01:08:13.567 --> 01:08:16.768
And... now he's just
another guy that works in TV.

01:08:16.803 --> 01:08:20.904
<i>You know, another guy that has an erratic
work schedule and travels constantly.</i>

01:08:20.941 --> 01:08:22.540
And is fiercely independent?

01:08:22.576 --> 01:08:24.676
I don't know anyone
who's compatible for that.

01:08:24.711 --> 01:08:27.645
<i>At least not anyone
who is also my sister.</i>

01:08:27.714 --> 01:08:30.180
Maggie, when I met my husband,
what did you tell me?

01:08:30.216 --> 01:08:32.517
<i>I know what I said.
But that doesn't...</i>

01:08:32.551 --> 01:08:33.629
<i>You said, "If you like him,
go ahead and like him.</i>

01:08:33.653 --> 01:08:34.986
Work it out later".

01:08:35.020 --> 01:08:36.087
<i>Right, but that's not...</i>

01:08:36.122 --> 01:08:38.157
That's advice for everyone else,
but not for you?

01:08:39.759 --> 01:08:41.526
Yes?

01:08:41.560 --> 01:08:43.661
Well, then may I suggest
you start taking advice

01:08:43.697 --> 01:08:46.731
...from my sister, Maggie.
She's really smart.

01:08:47.701 --> 01:08:51.536
- I'll consider it.
- That's all I ask.

01:08:51.571 --> 01:08:53.037
Go get him, Mags.

01:08:53.106 --> 01:08:55.640
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

01:09:05.218 --> 01:09:08.486
Hey!
Merry Christmas Eve!

01:09:08.520 --> 01:09:13.124
Is there a tour group,
or a fleet of sailors,

01:09:13.158 --> 01:09:17.028
or maybe little mini elves
coming that I don't know about?

01:09:17.063 --> 01:09:19.964
Yeah, well, this is what I do
when I'm nervous.

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.100
I just wanted to start early
on the crew meal,

01:09:22.135 --> 01:09:24.368
and, you know, go over my lines.

01:09:24.404 --> 01:09:26.537
Well, you will have the Teleprompter,

01:09:26.573 --> 01:09:28.173
and it takes you
through the entire show,

01:09:28.207 --> 01:09:29.908
from cooking of the goose
to the end.

01:09:29.943 --> 01:09:32.076
Good.
Because I cannot memorize a thing.

01:09:32.112 --> 01:09:33.112
I know.

01:09:33.180 --> 01:09:38.116
- Merry Christmas Eve, everyone.
- Back atcha.

01:09:38.151 --> 01:09:40.452
I have some things
that I need to re-check, so...

01:09:40.487 --> 01:09:41.786
Yeah, I...

01:09:41.854 --> 01:09:43.733
I downloaded all the videos
so we can throw to them.

01:09:43.756 --> 01:09:46.124
Great. And the Teleprompter is loaded,
so we can check that...

01:09:46.158 --> 01:09:47.325
Good, why don't you two

01:09:47.359 --> 01:09:49.560
take this conversation
maybe somewhere else?

01:09:49.595 --> 01:09:51.529
I'm sorry, are we making you
nervous, Mom?

01:09:51.564 --> 01:09:52.930
Yeah. Yup.

01:09:53.299 --> 01:09:56.167
Why don't... why don't we help?
All of us.

01:09:56.236 --> 01:09:58.870
That's not a bad idea.

01:09:58.905 --> 01:10:01.839
We'll all pitch in, you know?
Take the edge off.

01:10:17.423 --> 01:10:21.058
Stacy, can you help me
over here, please?

01:10:25.960 --> 01:10:27.144
I've...

01:10:28.262 --> 01:10:30.868
got some rosemary if you want it.

01:10:32.485 --> 01:10:34.339
No, the recipe doesn't call for it.

01:10:35.141 --> 01:10:36.774
Okay.

01:10:42.816 --> 01:10:46.284
- Here.
- What's that?

01:10:46.352 --> 01:10:50.555
It's the behind-the-scenes clips
that you liked.

01:10:50.623 --> 01:10:52.824
I thought
I'd make a copy for you.

01:10:59.933 --> 01:11:01.299
Thank you.

01:11:03.903 --> 01:11:06.737
I left the show because
of my brothers.

01:11:08.408 --> 01:11:10.274
To answer your question.

01:11:14.981 --> 01:11:19.716
When my dad died,
my mom poured herself into her work.

01:11:20.587 --> 01:11:23.287
I mean, she was heartbroken, you know?

01:11:23.356 --> 01:11:27.692
And she hired me right out of college
to produce the first special.

01:11:27.727 --> 01:11:30.394
I did it,
for two years.

01:11:30.430 --> 01:11:31.926
It was great, but...

01:11:33.233 --> 01:11:36.534
it made my brothers feel left out.

01:11:38.504 --> 01:11:40.004
Eventually, I started to notice

01:11:40.073 --> 01:11:42.273
that they were spending
Christmas in one place,

01:11:42.342 --> 01:11:46.344
and Mom and I
were spending it another.

01:11:46.379 --> 01:11:48.446
I quit because...

01:11:48.481 --> 01:11:51.182
it wasn't fair.

01:11:51.217 --> 01:11:53.362
I mean, if I wanted to spend
Christmas with my brothers,

01:11:53.386 --> 01:11:55.920
then that would mean that my mom
would be alone on Christmas,

01:11:55.956 --> 01:11:58.789
and that wasn't fair to her.

01:11:58.825 --> 01:12:01.292
It was a no-win situation.

01:12:02.762 --> 01:12:04.362
You spend Christmas alone?

01:12:05.765 --> 01:12:07.632
I travel.

01:12:07.667 --> 01:12:09.033
I work.

01:12:11.137 --> 01:12:16.073
Christmas in Iceland is a lot more
impressive than you'd think.

01:12:21.514 --> 01:12:26.284
I know it doesn't call for it, but...

01:12:26.319 --> 01:12:27.551
trust me.

01:12:30.056 --> 01:12:32.556
Pushy...

01:12:32.625 --> 01:12:35.226
you just have to have your
hands in everything, don't you?

01:12:35.261 --> 01:12:37.895
When you know something works,
you just gotta trust me.

01:12:52.712 --> 01:12:54.312
Thank you for joining us.

01:12:54.347 --> 01:12:57.748
I'm Julia Wise.
Have a Merry Christmas.

01:12:59.585 --> 01:13:01.652
All right, everyone,
that's the last rehearsal!

01:13:03.256 --> 01:13:04.400
All right, everybody,
take a bite of your cookie,

01:13:04.424 --> 01:13:07.892
take a sip of your coffee,
and prepare yourselves!

01:13:07.927 --> 01:13:10.027
We're about to go live.

01:13:10.063 --> 01:13:13.097
But please save room
for the crew meal after?

01:13:13.132 --> 01:13:15.866
- All right, let's get set to go.
- Oh, thank you.

01:13:15.902 --> 01:13:17.668
Looks good...

01:13:18.838 --> 01:13:20.304
What?

01:13:20.340 --> 01:13:22.773
Wait, no, wait for it,
don't freak out.

01:13:30.683 --> 01:13:34.118
And the generators are up and
running, nothing to see here, folks,

01:13:34.187 --> 01:13:37.749
- ... just a little pre-show excitement.
- All right, that's 30 seconds, everyone!

01:13:40.593 --> 01:13:44.261
- Danny?
- What's happening?

01:13:44.330 --> 01:13:46.897
Does anyone see the
segments on the server?

01:13:46.966 --> 01:13:49.133
What's going on, gang?
We're airing in 30 seconds.

01:13:49.168 --> 01:13:53.104
- No, no, no, no...
- What? What? What's wrong?

01:13:53.172 --> 01:13:56.774
I think there was a surge
when the power came back on.

01:13:56.809 --> 01:13:58.242
We can broadcast live,

01:13:58.277 --> 01:14:01.545
but it is going to take a while
for these servers to boot back up.

01:14:01.581 --> 01:14:03.647
Wait, so we don't have
the segments?

01:14:03.683 --> 01:14:05.983
Whoa, wait a minute,
we're doing the whole show live?

01:14:06.019 --> 01:14:08.786
No, no... Maybe.
I just, I don't know yet.

01:14:08.821 --> 01:14:10.221
Okay, five seconds, everyone.

01:14:10.256 --> 01:14:12.701
- Julia, you okay with this?
- Yeah, I'll have the Teleprompter.

01:14:12.725 --> 01:14:16.961
- The prompter is booting up, too.
- Okay, you're on in three...

01:14:28.174 --> 01:14:29.607
Julia?

01:14:36.349 --> 01:14:37.349
Julia!

01:14:38.484 --> 01:14:41.186
Hello.
Merry Christmas.

01:14:41.288 --> 01:14:42.654
As promised,

01:14:42.690 --> 01:14:45.891
we are bring you The Julia Wise
Christmas Special live this year,

01:14:45.926 --> 01:14:47.492
but fear not!

01:14:47.528 --> 01:14:49.828
Because we have thick sweaters,
we have plenty of food,

01:14:49.863 --> 01:14:52.331
and we have a show
full of Christmas cheer.

01:14:52.399 --> 01:14:57.302
But first...
At the end of "A Christmas Carol,"

01:14:57.338 --> 01:15:02.741
Dickens writes of the Cratchits' meal,
"There never was such a goose.

01:15:02.776 --> 01:15:06.044
"Its flavor, tenderness,
size, and value,

01:15:06.080 --> 01:15:09.381
were the themes
of universal admiration".

01:15:09.450 --> 01:15:13.452
So tonight, I'm going to show you
how to make the perfect Christmas goose.

01:15:13.520 --> 01:15:17.289
- Is this in the script?
- No. She's winging it.

01:15:17.324 --> 01:15:18.802
- It's great.
- ... As always in cooking...

01:15:18.826 --> 01:15:20.070
- Right.
- ... you want to make sure

01:15:20.094 --> 01:15:21.237
that you cut yourself a little slack.

01:15:21.261 --> 01:15:25.664
If you've invited people into your home,
well, you have to remember,

01:15:25.699 --> 01:15:29.801
that they probably love you enough to
forgive you any kind of kitchen mistake.

01:15:29.837 --> 01:15:33.005
Right, how are the segments coming?
She's going to run out of things to say.

01:15:33.040 --> 01:15:35.674
Not good. They're big files.

01:15:35.709 --> 01:15:37.175
Keep her going,

01:15:37.211 --> 01:15:39.144
get the prompter running,
and I'll be right back.

01:15:39.179 --> 01:15:42.047
- Whoa, whoa, where are you going?
- Trust me.

01:16:05.706 --> 01:16:08.440
- Derek?
- Told you I'd figure it out.

01:16:08.475 --> 01:16:11.209
- David! You came!
- This was not easy.

01:16:11.245 --> 01:16:14.946
I don't like trains, I can't feel
my toes, and my face is freezing,

01:16:14.982 --> 01:16:16.948
but then this nice driver
gave us hot cider,

01:16:16.984 --> 01:16:18.461
and drove us here
in a one-horse open sleigh,

01:16:18.485 --> 01:16:19.918
and... and I'm pumped!

01:16:19.953 --> 01:16:22.487
I feel like George Bailey in
"It's A Wonderful Life!"

01:16:22.823 --> 01:16:24.989
Merry Christmas,
you old farmhouse!

01:16:25.959 --> 01:16:29.361
- David, we're filming.
- Sorry.

01:16:29.396 --> 01:16:33.264
Actually, I have the best idea.

01:16:33.300 --> 01:16:36.901
Now, let's start
that goose stuffing, shall we?

01:16:36.937 --> 01:16:39.371
You're going go take
four tablespoons of butter,

01:16:39.406 --> 01:16:41.973
and you will add that
to your large skillet.

01:16:42.008 --> 01:16:46.411
At this point, we'll pick up
the five cooking apples

01:16:46.446 --> 01:16:49.347
that we discussed earlier,
that are now cored, peeled...

01:16:49.383 --> 01:16:50.782
Prompter's back up.

01:16:50.817 --> 01:16:52.328
The videos are still going
to be a little bit though.

01:16:52.352 --> 01:16:54.219
Danny...

01:16:54.254 --> 01:16:57.856
- You want to use this?
- Yes, they're perfect.

01:16:57.891 --> 01:16:59.924
They're smaller files, we could
plug it right into the live feed.

01:16:59.960 --> 01:17:03.395
These are really rough.
I don't know, I'm not sure about this...

01:17:03.430 --> 01:17:06.231
I am.
I'm sure.

01:17:06.266 --> 01:17:08.199
...And make sure
you go back and stir occasionally

01:17:08.235 --> 01:17:09.834
to avoid any kind of scorching...

01:17:18.111 --> 01:17:21.279
We wanted to bring you
something new this year.

01:17:21.314 --> 01:17:22.980
We're going to bring a little bit

01:17:23.016 --> 01:17:25.616
of holiday celebrations
right where you are

01:17:25.652 --> 01:17:27.752
in a series that we call
"Cross-Country Christmas".

01:17:27.787 --> 01:17:29.253
Take a look.

01:17:29.622 --> 01:17:32.991
- And we're clear to video.
- Yeah!

01:17:38.731 --> 01:17:40.931
<i>Our first Christmas, we were...</i>

01:17:40.967 --> 01:17:43.434
<i>We were living in
your parents' basement!</i>

01:17:43.469 --> 01:17:46.003
<i>We had just gotten married
and moved to the farm...</i>

01:17:46.038 --> 01:17:48.837
So natural. Did you hire them?
Are they actors?

01:17:48.872 --> 01:17:49.908
No.

01:17:49.977 --> 01:17:52.311
Getting them to host themselves
was all Maggie's idea.

01:17:52.346 --> 01:17:53.703
But the edit was all Danny.

01:17:53.738 --> 01:17:57.015
<i>...'Cause here, Christmas is
about bringing together the town.</i>

01:17:57.051 --> 01:17:59.251
<i>They all come, they
get a cup of hot cider,</i>

01:17:59.286 --> 01:18:00.519
<i>and a Christmas tree.</i>

01:18:00.754 --> 01:18:02.887
<i>What's better than that?</i>

01:18:02.956 --> 01:18:04.289
This is a great addition.

01:18:06.126 --> 01:18:09.160
All right, we're coming back live
in a few seconds.

01:18:09.897 --> 01:18:11.396
Follow me.

01:18:14.768 --> 01:18:17.250
Okay, you're on in three...

01:18:20.140 --> 01:18:22.207
And now, onto side dishes.

01:18:22.276 --> 01:18:24.009
We've put together a few recipes

01:18:24.077 --> 01:18:27.445
that are sure to light up
your little reindeer noses.

01:18:27.514 --> 01:18:28.546
Where are we going?

01:18:33.887 --> 01:18:36.621
- You guys made it!
- Wouldn't miss it.

01:18:36.657 --> 01:18:39.557
And being the family Scrooge
isn't a good look on anyone.

01:18:39.626 --> 01:18:41.904
Mom's going to be so excited
to see you guys after the show.

01:18:41.928 --> 01:18:44.095
Wait, Maggie has a better idea.

01:18:48.902 --> 01:18:52.217
The secret to any good holiday party
is to make sure that you have...

01:18:53.807 --> 01:18:55.940
Making sure that
you have plenty of...

01:19:00.280 --> 01:19:05.383
Well, I don't know who that could be,
but we are going to find out together.

01:19:06.420 --> 01:19:09.455
Go follow her.
You guys, come with me.

01:19:28.141 --> 01:19:30.742
- Hi, Mama.
- Derek!

01:19:33.113 --> 01:19:34.113
David...

01:19:36.483 --> 01:19:38.516
Merry Christmas, Mom.

01:19:42.422 --> 01:19:43.422
I am...

01:19:43.490 --> 01:19:44.490
These are...

01:19:45.926 --> 01:19:48.999
I had no idea that this
was gonna happen, I swear.

01:19:49.596 --> 01:19:53.498
Boys, this the, this
is the viewing audience.

01:19:53.533 --> 01:19:58.570
Audience...
these are my three Wise men.

01:20:09.850 --> 01:20:11.883
Now, I really need to go

01:20:11.918 --> 01:20:14.753
and give my boys
a proper hug and catch up,

01:20:14.788 --> 01:20:16.955
so why don't you take a look
at another one

01:20:16.990 --> 01:20:18.757
of our Cross-Country
Christmas segments,

01:20:18.792 --> 01:20:19.924
and we'll be right back.

01:20:22.129 --> 01:20:23.828
And we're clear to video!

01:20:25.132 --> 01:20:28.066
Maggie, the Internet is going nuts
for this. They love it!

01:20:28.101 --> 01:20:29.101
How?

01:20:29.169 --> 01:20:30.568
How did this happen?

01:20:31.538 --> 01:20:32.538
What?

01:20:35.242 --> 01:20:37.542
Maggie.

01:20:38.645 --> 01:20:39.889
All right, let's not
get ahead of ourselves.

01:20:39.913 --> 01:20:41.546
We still have a show to finish.

01:20:41.615 --> 01:20:43.495
Cameras back to one,
everybody get back to work.

01:20:47.821 --> 01:20:48.865
All right, we're almost there, gang.

01:20:48.889 --> 01:20:50.155
Awesome.

01:20:55.529 --> 01:20:58.163
This is all I've wanted,

01:20:58.198 --> 01:21:00.865
so thank you for finding the time.

01:21:00.934 --> 01:21:02.600
Well, we talked about it, and...

01:21:02.636 --> 01:21:03.946
Yeah, well, we just had to grow up some,

01:21:03.970 --> 01:21:06.604
you know, think about you
more than we were.

01:21:08.575 --> 01:21:11.309
This... This was my dad's.
Where did you find this?

01:21:11.344 --> 01:21:13.144
Your mom found it.

01:21:13.213 --> 01:21:16.314
So we're going to cue you in,
and we need you to start "Have... "

01:21:16.349 --> 01:21:18.450
Wait, wait, wait.
You know I can't sing, right?

01:21:18.485 --> 01:21:21.631
Yeah, but you play beautifully.
I've watched all of your videos.

01:21:21.655 --> 01:21:25.023
- You start, and we'll join in.
- Danny, you can't sing either.

01:21:25.058 --> 01:21:26.702
Sadly, that's true, but
it's never stopped me before.

01:21:26.726 --> 01:21:28.827
No, and it never stopped Dad.

01:21:28.862 --> 01:21:30.228
I don't know...

01:21:30.263 --> 01:21:32.108
Buddy, buddy, we can't argue
about how great you are.

01:21:32.132 --> 01:21:35.300
Now, get in there and
warm up, and get started!

01:21:35.335 --> 01:21:37.001
- Okay, okay.
- Come on.

01:21:40.173 --> 01:21:42.073
Maggie...

01:21:42.108 --> 01:21:43.208
Thank you.

01:21:58.124 --> 01:21:59.757
Thank you.

01:22:00.961 --> 01:22:02.827
For this, for... everything.

01:22:02.863 --> 01:22:06.832
Hey.
We did it together, Danny Wise.

01:22:08.435 --> 01:22:09.801
You know,

01:22:09.870 --> 01:22:14.539
if you do need someone next year
to help you with the segments,

01:22:14.608 --> 01:22:17.275
who, you know, trusts you
from the very get-go...

01:22:18.445 --> 01:22:20.111
You're hired.

01:22:20.180 --> 01:22:21.746
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:22:21.782 --> 01:22:24.983
Okay, people,
let's get back to this, all right?

01:22:25.018 --> 01:22:28.586
In five, four, three...
two...

01:22:46.406 --> 01:22:47.539
Everybody!

01:22:47.574 --> 01:22:50.408
Go and eat something nice,
invite your neighbors over,

01:22:50.477 --> 01:22:51.976
look through your old photo albums,

01:22:52.012 --> 01:22:56.581
and tell your friends and family
how much you love them...

01:22:56.616 --> 01:23:01.350
and have yourself
a Merry Christmas!
