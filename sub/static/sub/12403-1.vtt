01:13.440 --> 01:15.079
And it happens when?

01:16.120 --> 01:17.999
My wife wants to save,

01:18.200 --> 01:19.919
To show it to friends.

01:20.120 --> 01:22.839
Is off laptop.
We did an interview.

01:23.040 --> 01:24.599
I look at you?

01:25.320 --> 01:28.519
I am with Duncan, who
works for Elite.

01:28.720 --> 01:30.639
I have a few questions.

01:30.840 --> 01:31.839
Yes.

01:32.560 --> 01:34.399
I'm asking you first.

01:34.800 --> 01:36.559
What is a lineman?

01:39.160 --> 01:41.559
A lineman is what
was once called

01:41.760 --> 01:43.679
A poser power lines.

01:45.320 --> 01:47.559
- Since 1943, they
... - No. Sorry.

01:47.760 --> 01:50.319
I do not want an
encyclopedic release.

01:50.640 --> 01:52.519
What is a lineman for you?

01:52.720 --> 01:53.919
Spontaneously.

01:58.080 --> 02:02.119
The asshole that you're happy to see
when the end of the world approaches.

02:02.480 --> 02:04.079
I'm allowed to say that?

02:05.760 --> 02:06.999
I said a bad word.

02:07.200 --> 02:09.318
It's okay.
We will manage.

02:09.520 --> 02:11.439
- There will be a beep?
- Yes.

02:11.640 --> 02:14.959
This is exactly what I
expected, a crude response

02:15.240 --> 02:16.719
True.

02:18.440 --> 02:20.879
Tell us what happened,

02:21.080 --> 02:22.999
Night of the storm.

02:24.520 --> 02:28.119
What has really
happened in post 12?

03:19.320 --> 03:20.519
Dad!

03:26.040 --> 03:27.519
I'm here, my angel.

03:30.680 --> 03:31.919
Dad!

03:32.360 --> 03:33.199
All is well.

03:33.400 --> 03:34.399
I'm here.

03:35.520 --> 03:38.199
It must not be afraid
of lightning, baby.

03:38.960 --> 03:41.399
It is God who reminds
us that He is there.

03:42.840 --> 03:44.119
You go away.

03:45.680 --> 03:47.079
Go.

03:47.280 --> 03:50.039
You know I have to. But...

03:50.400 --> 03:51.879
I have a gift for you.

03:52.440 --> 03:53.959
If there is more light.

03:54.480 --> 03:55.279
Agree?

04:03.400 --> 04:04.719
I love you, my angel.

04:06.400 --> 04:07.999
I, too, Dad.

04:21.760 --> 04:23.999
Okay. Yes.

04:26.760 --> 04:28.839
- It is well?
- It will be fine.

04:31.040 --> 04:32.639
This is your mistress.

04:35.760 --> 04:37.479
Hi, Pok Chop. It was what?

04:37.680 --> 04:39.719
A branch fell on the line.

04:39.920 --> 04:42.359
- Near the highway.
- You got Beau?

04:42.560 --> 04:44.959
- No. He does not reply.
- Call him.

04:45.320 --> 04:48.479
I go home.
If it is there, I get high.

04:48.680 --> 04:50.159
- It works.
- OK.

04:50.520 --> 04:52.239
- Right Now.
- Asset'.

04:57.120 --> 04:57.879
Becky...

04:58.320 --> 04:59.839
I also, I love you.

05:08.080 --> 05:08.919
Go.

05:14.960 --> 05:16.439
You take care of yourself.

05:16.960 --> 05:19.439
- Do not go too fast.
- Well, ma'am.

05:26.160 --> 05:27.479
It was cut in two.

05:37.000 --> 05:38.799
The mass was sectioned.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.559
We're stuck.

05:41.240 --> 05:43.399
- Where is your brother?
- Not home.

05:43.600 --> 05:44.639
I do not know.

05:44.840 --> 05:47.999
Beau, what are you doing?
Earth to Beau.

05:48.200 --> 05:51.199
I arrive.
I'm as fast as I can.

05:51.480 --> 05:53.399
Turn around and see me.

05:53.600 --> 05:55.759
Be careful. Roule not too fast.

05:56.200 --> 05:58.959
- Turn around, I am here.
- Oh, fuck!

06:06.000 --> 06:08.319
I told you to go quietly.

06:08.720 --> 06:10.879
- Freak of Species!
- Look at this.

06:11.080 --> 06:12.479
You'll screw up the truck.

06:16.480 --> 06:18.399
It's nothing.

06:18.600 --> 06:19.559
Where were you?

06:19.760 --> 06:22.159
I partied with my
future ex-wife.

06:22.360 --> 06:24.879
- You was celebrating what?
- My birthday.

06:25.080 --> 06:27.399
Come on, do not face.

06:27.880 --> 06:29.279
Happy birthday, Beau.

06:29.680 --> 06:32.879
To celebrate, we will
release the damn tree.

06:34.400 --> 06:36.159
Let's go. Let's go.

06:46.120 --> 06:48.439

Is removed.

07:30.880 --> 07:32.199
Chief, what do we do?

07:32.400 --> 07:35.719
It gives off branches from
the road and we go home.

07:35.920 --> 07:38.519
Ta line, it is like
new, my Danny.

07:38.720 --> 07:40.479
Fuck Beautiful!

07:40.680 --> 07:44.079

Look at this work.

07:44.600 --> 07:46.439
- Do You forgot one.

07:46.640 --> 07:47.959
No, no.

07:49.520 --> 07:51.879

10:34.120 --> 10:35.319
Beau is there.

10:54.160 --> 10:56.879
- Who's your favorite uncle?
- You.

10:57.600 --> 10:59.039
You have said.

11:02.480 --> 11:03.879
My heart,

11:04.520 --> 11:06.639
You know that your parents love you.

11:07.960 --> 11:09.919
I have something to tell you.

11:10.120 --> 11:11.999
It will take you to be strong.

13:37.720 --> 13:38.759
Uncle Beau?

13:39.480 --> 13:42.599
Pok Chop called.

13:43.360 --> 13:45.559
- This is an emergency.
- What?

13:49.160 --> 13:50.399
You said what?

14:35.560 --> 14:37.839
- What are you looking?
- New neighbors.

14:38.040 --> 14:38.999

14:40.000 --> 14:41.159

14:44.200 --> 14:47.239
- You did your thing for college?
- Registration?

14:47.440 --> 14:48.599
I'll do it tomorrow.

14:48.920 --> 14:50.439
Because today...

14:51.480 --> 14:54.399
Today is someone's birthday.

14:55.080 --> 14:57.959
- Happy Birthday.
- You know I hate that.

14:58.160 --> 15:00.279
But I love cakes.

15:04.440 --> 15:06.519
I make you a dinner party tonight.

15:06.800 --> 15:09.039
- Potatoes in the oven?
- Yes.

15:09.760 --> 15:11.999
It bothers you if

You got scared.

17:55.720 --> 17:59.119
I thought you was afraid

17:59.320 --> 18:02.359
No. It is this card
that scares me.

18:02.680 --> 18:04.679
Modernising half of the state.

18:06.120 --> 18:08.079
It's about the line 12.

18:08.280 --> 18:11.879
This is the largest county
and most dangerous.

18:13.280 --> 18:15.399
It is not evil fucks my age.

I saved on the packaging.

18:41.080 --> 18:42.839
Beau, you're need money,

18:43.040 --> 18:45.879
But have you ever kept a

18:54.680 --> 18:56.919
" if it not kill him, he
would stop breathing "

18:58.200 --> 18:59.879
It was not seen when

Have a good day.

19:56.200 --> 19:57.679
This is the carburetor.

Can you fix it?

20:00.360 --> 20:01.319
Yeah.

20:01.920 --> 20:04.519
- It'll be long?
- As long as it takes.

20:06.200 --> 20:07.199
Where are you going like this?

20:08.880 --> 20:09.599
Hi, Ron.

20:10.280 --> 20:11.759

- You got a job?

20:17.920 --> 20:18.839
Perhaps.

20:20.720 --> 20:22.879
Bailey should be happy.

20:24.240 --> 20:26.159
It's true.
You are more together.

20:26.360 --> 20:27.959
You do not film.

20:28.800 --> 20:31.279
- This is cool between us.
- This is not what we say.

20:32.640 --> 20:33.959
I'll tell you something.

20:34.160 --> 20:35.559
What?

20:35.760 --> 20:37.559
Grab your tool and
go back to work.

20:38.560 --> 20:41.079
Do not make me call
your probation officer.

20:41.560 --> 20:42.759
Go!

20:44.440 --> 20:45.959
You approach not Bailey.

20:57.960 --> 20:58.839
Hi, beautiful.

20:59.440 --> 21:00.959
I'll smoke.

21:01.160 --> 21:02.599
You want to stop?

21:03.760 --> 21:05.759
When you will recover smile.

Thank you.

21:12.840 --> 21:13.879

We have great kids.

21:26.800 --> 21:28.519
I'll get your helmet.

21:37.920 --> 21:39.559
The kids are right there.

21:43.320 --> 21:44.839
Stop, Carline.

21:45.160 --> 21:47.359
- We're in the room?
- Carline!

22:19.240 --> 22:20.599
What is it?

22:21.400 --> 22:22.639
What is it?

22:23.280 --> 22:25.239
I called it a week ago.

22:26.200 --> 22:28.199
I had stuff to do.
Sorry.

22:28.400 --> 22:29.639
What such stuff?

22:30.320 --> 22:33.039
Can I have a ham and
cheese sandwich?

22:33.240 --> 22:34.719
The cook is paused.

22:34.920 --> 22:37.159
Please.
You'd be too cute.

22:45.400 --> 22:46.199
Okay.

22:49.280 --> 22:51.079
Why so secretive?

22:51.840 --> 22:53.599
The university hath remembered?

22:54.400 --> 22:56.399

- Without mustard.

22:56.880 --> 22:58.919
I thought you were leaving soon.

23:02.680 --> 23:04.519
You should have remembered.

23:05.000 --> 23:07.159
Bailey, what does that make?

23:11.560 --> 23:12.599
Nothing.

23:16.240 --> 23:17.799
I have to go to work.

23:18.000 --> 23:19.159
You got a job?

23:20.080 --> 23:21.359
I have a job.

23:39.440 --> 23:40.879
- Here.

23:41.080 --> 23:42.159

23:43.240 --> 23:44.919

You know that?

24:17.400 --> 24:19.839
- This fact saucer.
- Good game.

24:20.040 --> 24:21.799

Mouse, man. Tape laying.

24:24.400 --> 24:25.639
Oh, fuck!

24:25.840 --> 24:27.759
What makes you laugh?

24:27.960 --> 24:31.279
You're stuck because your
knees are too near the post.

24:31.480 --> 24:33.159
You have learned that the first day.

24:33.680 --> 24:36.919
- Everybody inside.
- You heard ?

24:38.840 --> 24:39.959
Okay?

24:50.200 --> 24:51.239
Who hired him?

24:51.440 --> 24:53.599
All I know is that it's not you.

24:53.800 --> 24:55.039
Why are we doing this to me?

24:55.240 --> 24:56.399
And it is late.

24:56.600 --> 24:58.639
Do not syncope, Mr. Ginner.

25:00.800 --> 25:02.279
Come on, gentlemen.

25:02.560 --> 25:04.159
One sits.

25:04.360 --> 25:06.639
You are silent and listen.

25:06.840 --> 25:08.599
- The horror movie?
- Go ahead.

25:10.480 --> 25:12.079
You see this guy?

25:12.280 --> 25:15.919
This guy has passed with
flying colors the safety test.

25:16.200 --> 25:18.239
It was one of the top 10.

25:18.440 --> 25:22.079
One day he has not quite put
all his protective equipment.

25:22.280 --> 25:24.759
I do not know why.
He was late,

25:24.960 --> 25:27.199
He might head elsewhere.

25:27.400 --> 25:29.279
But if you think

25:29.480 --> 25:32.519
Half a million volts,
it's not much,

25:33.040 --> 25:34.279
You're so strong

25:34.480 --> 25:36.079
You never make a mistake,

25:36.520 --> 25:37.759
It not happen,

25:38.760 --> 25:40.399
Then you're too stupid.

25:40.800 --> 25:42.279
Even if you're smart,

25:42.480 --> 25:44.159
If you listen to what I say,

25:44.800 --> 25:45.999
If you follow the procedure

25:47.080 --> 25:51.159
Simply an unguarded moment,
you think of money problems,

25:51.360 --> 25:52.479
Your wife

25:53.120 --> 25:55.119
Or your mistress, or both.

25:57.240 --> 25:58.719
One second of inattention,

25:59.800 --> 26:02.239
A moment when you
are not focused,

26:02.440 --> 26:03.759
And you're dead.

26:05.000 --> 26:08.239
I want to be left all
the problems at home.

26:08.440 --> 26:10.239
We stay focused.

26:10.440 --> 26:12.519
And we do not malignant.

26:13.560 --> 26:14.599
The company

26:14.800 --> 26:17.959
Generates most of the Texas
network modernization

26:18.160 --> 26:21.039
And it is also the biggest
project we've had to do.

26:21.240 --> 26:23.799
What awaits you is no picnic.

26:24.320 --> 26:26.759
God knows that this
business is not easy.

26:26.960 --> 26:29.079
But the network has more than 30 years.

26:29.280 --> 26:33.719
And we must renew entirely
before the storm season.

26:33.920 --> 26:34.999
It is not too hit the street,

26:35.200 --> 26:38.399
But lineman is the 4th
most dangerous occupation.

26:39.120 --> 26:41.159
Develop a rabid tiger furry

26:41.360 --> 26:43.359
Is the 5th most dangerous job.

26:43.560 --> 26:45.319
That does not prevent me from sleeping.

26:46.440 --> 26:47.719
It's a joke.

26:49.280 --> 26:50.559
Questions?

26:56.760 --> 26:57.639
Shit.

27:03.320 --> 27:06.079
- What are you doing here?
- I'm coming to see you.

27:07.160 --> 27:10.039
- You should not be there.
- What is happening ?

27:10.240 --> 27:11.199
Nothing.

27:11.400 --> 27:14.599
I heard you were more with your guy.
It's sad.

27:15.320 --> 27:16.559
People talk too much.

27:17.520 --> 27:18.839
Let me help you.

27:20.560 --> 27:21.479
You do not come home.

27:22.320 --> 27:23.079
Go away.

27:23.280 --> 27:24.799
Hey, cowboy.

27:25.560 --> 27:26.839
Give him his business.

27:28.280 --> 27:30.479
Where she goes, this one?

27:31.360 --> 27:34.799
I'll kick your ass if you
do not give him her purse.

27:40.920 --> 27:42.039
A next time.

27:43.000 --> 27:43.839
I'll come back.

27:45.680 --> 27:48.879
You change your mind.
And your girlfriend should be careful.

27:52.920 --> 27:54.559
Who was that?

27:55.320 --> 27:56.919
A youthful indiscretion.

28:15.400 --> 28:16.439
Hi.

28:26.080 --> 28:27.159
Good evening.

28:28.160 --> 28:29.439
You're home late.

28:31.720 --> 28:33.479
You're out with friends?

28:45.800 --> 28:47.279
Have you seen Duncan?

28:48.040 --> 28:49.439
No. Why ?

28:49.640 --> 28:50.959
You sure?

28:52.160 --> 28:52.759
Why?

28:53.880 --> 28:57.479
Guess who has just been hired
as an apprentice to Elite.

28:59.760 --> 29:01.879
I do not want you to go out with him.

29:02.280 --> 29:02.879
I know.

29:03.160 --> 29:04.799
It will make you suffer.

29:05.120 --> 29:06.119
And his family...

29:06.960 --> 29:08.679
It has not chosen his family.

29:08.880 --> 29:11.719
I'm just saying that it will
prevent you from moving forward.

29:19.840 --> 29:20.439
What?

29:21.320 --> 29:22.519
No, nothing.

29:24.160 --> 29:25.239
Okay, the steak?

29:25.440 --> 29:26.759
It looks good.

29:29.680 --> 29:32.279
You did your thing, there? Ton...

29:32.480 --> 29:35.239
Your stuff for college.
I do not know what.

29:35.440 --> 29:37.399
- Registration.
- You done?

29:49.480 --> 29:50.959
I'm taking.

29:51.280 --> 29:53.359
I am automatically accepted.

29:54.360 --> 29:56.479
You do not have to worry about me.

30:00.760 --> 30:03.559
Treasury, I make it,
worry about you.

30:04.160 --> 30:07.279
Night and day.
Sometimes I not sleep.

30:07.800 --> 30:09.279
It's stronger than me.

30:10.240 --> 30:11.759
I have only you.

30:54.520 --> 30:56.079
It is 8 am, Mom.

30:59.040 --> 31:00.639
In the morning?

31:01.840 --> 31:02.919
Yes.

31:03.920 --> 31:04.839
What are you doing?

31:05.600 --> 31:07.199
I go to work, Mom.

31:07.440 --> 31:08.559
At work?

31:08.760 --> 31:10.479
What's that, your work?

31:11.000 --> 31:13.119
I have told you, I'm lineman.

31:13.520 --> 31:14.799
Lineman...

31:15.000 --> 31:16.999
Your father was lineman.

31:18.960 --> 31:21.319
It is mounted on top of a pole

31:22.320 --> 31:24.119
And he was killed.

31:26.320 --> 31:29.599
- He left us nothing.
- Stop with that crap.

31:30.560 --> 31:32.959
Dad drank, but it
was an accident.

31:36.280 --> 31:37.919
That way, you're lineman?

31:38.200 --> 31:39.399
Yeah, Mom.

31:39.920 --> 31:41.039
Well...

31:42.160 --> 31:43.639
Look at me.

31:49.640 --> 31:51.919
Go to work there.

31:53.920 --> 31:56.359
Go get yourself killed.

31:57.040 --> 31:58.959
I will not cry.

31:59.400 --> 32:01.439
I not come to your funeral.

32:01.640 --> 32:03.439
- You understand?
- OK Mom.

33:06.120 --> 33:07.279
What are you doing here?

33:07.720 --> 33:10.919
You send text messages?
You're not paid for it.

33:12.320 --> 33:13.799
Have you checked the post?

33:14.120 --> 33:15.999
Yes. Its good.

33:16.360 --> 33:17.599
Restart.

33:21.000 --> 33:22.039
That's it.

33:24.800 --> 33:25.759
Warning!

33:31.560 --> 33:33.719
I had the eye, he nothing.

33:34.680 --> 33:36.599
Look, it broke at the base.

33:36.800 --> 33:38.519
I do not know how did you get here

33:38.720 --> 33:42.199
But when we ended the contract,
I want to see your face.

33:42.600 --> 33:43.679
It's got it?

33:48.320 --> 33:50.279
Get down from there, whore!

33:53.760 --> 33:55.839
It has reflexes for an old.

33:56.040 --> 33:58.479
Listen to me.
If this strikes you old,

33:58.960 --> 34:01.359
He'll blow his head.

34:07.080 --> 34:08.279
Hey, my pretty!

34:21.000 --> 34:24.039
If it continues like this,
I'm going to drink.

34:24.960 --> 34:26.159
Thank you, darling.

34:28.520 --> 34:30.119
Hey, you just serve us?

34:32.040 --> 34:34.478
Must do anything
to be served here?

34:34.679 --> 34:36.879
It makes me think of you, Beau.

34:38.760 --> 34:40.079
Guys cable.

34:40.480 --> 34:42.958
You can have me gratos chains?

34:43.480 --> 34:45.518
We were not install the cable.

34:45.719 --> 34:47.799
Serious, what do I have to do

34:48.000 --> 34:50.079
To have free cable?

34:50.520 --> 34:54.679
You should probably
just ask a cable guy.

34:57.360 --> 34:59.039
You get smart, you?

34:59.480 --> 35:01.799
But you know who you're talking to here?

35:02.000 --> 35:03.519
I do not know.

35:03.960 --> 35:05.199
A moron?

35:07.640 --> 35:08.959
You know who I am?

35:11.240 --> 35:14.199
Well, from what I see...

35:16.760 --> 35:19.319
An asshole makes no weight.

35:22.000 --> 35:23.199
Listening.

35:23.720 --> 35:27.239
We want no fuss.
It is slashed. We had our dose.

35:27.440 --> 35:29.719
So we left there. Come on!

35:32.400 --> 35:34.239
Do not be a bad choice.

35:34.440 --> 35:35.799
Go, tope there.

35:37.320 --> 35:38.639
- Okay.
- Great.

36:05.400 --> 36:07.119
You're done, my heart?

36:08.920 --> 36:11.319
Mom, what is it, dad business?

36:13.160 --> 36:15.359
It is lineman, honey.
You know well.

36:17.160 --> 36:18.759
But it is what?

36:21.040 --> 36:23.519
It repairs power lines.

36:27.560 --> 36:28.799
Hello, sweetie.

36:30.000 --> 36:31.599
You see these lines there?

36:32.080 --> 36:35.599
The oven, toaster, radio...

36:37.120 --> 36:41.319
I make sure that all of these
devices have electricity,

36:41.520 --> 36:43.279
So you miss anything

36:43.480 --> 36:44.399
When I'm not there.

37:00.480 --> 37:01.639
It works.

37:06.760 --> 37:09.399
It's too bad you're
missing the match Dylan.

37:11.240 --> 37:14.039
Call me as soon as you
know when you get home.

37:24.040 --> 37:25.279
Thank you.

37:36.440 --> 37:38.039
Your command.

37:38.240 --> 37:39.439
Thank you, darling.

37:58.760 --> 38:00.799
Why did you do your
asshole with me?

38:04.240 --> 38:05.479
Asshole...

38:06.960 --> 38:08.039
Really?

38:17.920 --> 38:18.839
What do we do?

38:19.880 --> 38:21.959
It seems that has separated.

38:27.200 --> 38:29.799
You're going off to
college, anyway.

38:36.080 --> 38:38.399
You were always too
strong to school.

38:40.560 --> 38:42.999
It was sure you were
going to end up leaving.

38:45.560 --> 38:49.399
Do you remember that day at the
school where your heel broke,

38:49.600 --> 38:52.399
Was all embarrassed you,
you wanted to walk.

38:53.680 --> 38:56.719
You must have been
afraid of being poor.

38:56.920 --> 38:58.479
As my family.

38:58.680 --> 39:00.239
- Do not say that.
- Do you remember ?

39:00.440 --> 39:01.799
You remember...

39:02.400 --> 39:04.879
I went to the workshop pick you.

39:05.960 --> 39:07.359
Remember?

39:10.160 --> 39:12.279
You told me that I
was a gentleman.

39:12.920 --> 39:15.279
It had never told me that before.

39:16.960 --> 39:18.119
You were one.

39:22.120 --> 39:23.239
I'm not sure.

39:25.480 --> 39:27.599
Why have you been so long

39:28.680 --> 39:31.599
Asking me to go out with
you after high school?

39:33.160 --> 39:34.119
I do not know.

39:36.640 --> 39:39.279
What are you waiting
for go to college?

39:58.360 --> 39:59.999
That's good. We end this.

40:03.400 --> 40:04.599
This is for you.

40:09.920 --> 40:11.439
I have for a second.

40:13.560 --> 40:14.959
Gentlemen.

40:16.440 --> 40:19.839
I heard about the
incident yesterday.

40:20.040 --> 40:21.079
It's annoying.

40:21.280 --> 40:23.239
It has lost almost 3 hours.

40:23.440 --> 40:25.519
This kind of thing can seriously

40:25.720 --> 40:29.319
Make us late.
Our employer is aware.

40:30.520 --> 40:32.079
And that's boring.

40:32.280 --> 40:34.319
It should be more careful.

40:35.280 --> 40:36.919
I hope you're kidding.

40:37.320 --> 40:39.519
I'm just extra careful.

40:39.720 --> 40:42.799
I'm doing it. My job
is to pay attention.

40:43.000 --> 40:44.719
Do more attention.

40:44.920 --> 40:46.879
You want another team leader?

40:47.080 --> 40:49.319
- All right.
- I did not say that.

40:49.520 --> 40:53.079
Yesterday I almost got killed.
I can leave my place.

40:53.280 --> 40:55.319
I have not said that. I am sorry.

40:55.520 --> 40:58.599
The utility enterprise has
poorly maintained the network

40:58.800 --> 41:00.919
And my guys put their lives.

41:01.120 --> 41:03.439
And I'm breaking my ass

41:03.640 --> 41:05.439
With kids to the TAF.

41:05.640 --> 41:07.399
You know what?

41:07.800 --> 41:10.679
The utility can go fuck himself.

41:10.880 --> 41:12.919
- You can tell them.
- OK, Beau.

41:13.120 --> 41:15.679
It was nice talking to you.

41:21.040 --> 41:22.439
Hi, neighbor.

41:22.640 --> 41:23.639
We drank?

41:24.160 --> 41:25.759
Eugene works?

41:26.480 --> 41:29.439
Yes. He left a few days.

41:30.520 --> 41:33.639
Sometimes I feel
I never see him.

41:35.360 --> 41:38.879
It's not easy being the wife
of a lineman. Or niece.

41:39.920 --> 41:41.199
You got lucky.

41:41.440 --> 41:44.439
You got great kids, a
husband, a beautiful home.

41:47.440 --> 41:51.239
Since Eugene returned
from Iraq, it's more...

41:52.040 --> 41:54.119
As before, between us.

41:54.480 --> 41:56.279
It was the war?

42:00.840 --> 42:03.479
It not want to talk,
but it's the same.

42:03.680 --> 42:06.199
Sometimes I have the
impression he is absent

42:06.400 --> 42:08.199
Even when he is at home.

42:09.560 --> 42:12.279
Our life is not as
perfect as that.

42:15.160 --> 42:16.359
Well...

42:17.320 --> 42:18.519
I thought it would.

42:21.680 --> 42:23.439
You have not touched your glass.

42:24.400 --> 42:25.959
I not drink much.

42:31.160 --> 42:32.559
Did you expect what?

42:34.320 --> 42:37.319
I have never lost
a man on my team.

42:37.520 --> 42:40.799
Not one. Think we
welcome a me for this?

42:41.000 --> 42:42.999
Fontaine? He is worried.

42:43.200 --> 42:44.039
That's all.

42:44.240 --> 42:47.519
There's something to be
worried, stashed in his office.

42:47.720 --> 42:48.719
You do not know.

42:49.040 --> 42:51.839
There are risks to not
move the ass of the day.

42:54.160 --> 42:55.879
Low testosterone,

42:56.080 --> 42:57.319
the fat belly.

43:01.240 --> 43:03.599
Hey, why you put
yourself in that state?

43:03.800 --> 43:05.999
I thought Danny.

43:10.600 --> 43:12.399
I can not stop thinking about him.

43:14.000 --> 43:15.799
I should have been in his place.

43:16.000 --> 43:18.399
I know the chorus
and I not like it.

43:19.280 --> 43:21.359
It's not you who live with that.

43:21.720 --> 43:24.519
Hey, buddy, I was there too.

43:25.480 --> 43:28.839
As far as I know, it's not
you who controls lightning.

43:42.480 --> 43:43.559
Damn.

43:49.360 --> 43:51.079
Mr. Ginner, okay?

43:51.280 --> 43:53.079
Let alone Bailey.

43:53.880 --> 43:57.679
She projects. She has no
need for a ball like you.

43:57.880 --> 43:59.159
It's not very nice.

43:59.360 --> 44:01.959
If it goes, it's because of you.

44:03.360 --> 44:05.959
I not let her go out with you.

44:06.160 --> 44:07.399
One returns.

44:31.480 --> 44:32.279
Hi, Beautiful People.

44:32.480 --> 44:33.439
Okay?

45:09.160 --> 45:11.759
I'll see that with Russell.

45:12.320 --> 45:13.759
I'm on it.

45:17.880 --> 45:19.119
Well, precisely.

45:21.320 --> 45:22.879
You wanted to see me?

45:23.080 --> 45:26.119
Russell, we are far
behind our schedule.

45:26.320 --> 45:28.759
Bill, is made as quickly as we can.

45:29.000 --> 45:30.599
Just look at it with Beau.

45:31.040 --> 45:35.039
Listen... Beau is a
little too old school,

45:35.240 --> 45:36.639
Straddling settlement.

45:37.200 --> 45:40.079
I'm not saying it
poorly, but accelerate.

45:40.680 --> 45:44.319
In 2 weeks, transport and
distribution must arrive

45:44.520 --> 45:46.839
The post 12. And for now

45:47.040 --> 45:48.439
Were delayed everywhere.

45:50.040 --> 45:52.359
I know Beau 22 years.

45:52.560 --> 45:55.119
I work with him
because he is good.

45:57.760 --> 46:00.479
For our part, we will be ready.
Do not worry.

48:32.520 --> 48:34.159
Eugene, you come early.

48:36.720 --> 48:39.999
What are you doing?
Fouille not my business.

48:41.680 --> 48:44.799
There are numbers of
messages that I do not know.

48:45.400 --> 48:48.839
This is the friends I made
when you were not there.

48:49.680 --> 48:50.719
Like who?

48:52.400 --> 48:55.519
I went out with Bailey,
opposite the next.

48:56.560 --> 48:58.039
And friends to it.

49:10.920 --> 49:11.599
Where you going?

49:11.800 --> 49:14.079
Make my suitcase.
I'm leaving soon.

49:14.280 --> 49:16.559
You're kidding!
You just got back.

49:24.120 --> 49:26.759
- Can I ask you a question?
- Yes.

49:27.240 --> 49:29.639
Have you spent time with my wife?

49:30.520 --> 49:32.079
Yes, it was seen.

49:33.400 --> 49:34.719
With your friends too?

49:34.920 --> 49:35.879
My Friends?

49:36.080 --> 49:38.119
Eugene, stop bothering Bailey.

49:38.320 --> 49:40.799
I see too your friends
hang out here.

49:44.120 --> 49:45.479
With my friends.

49:50.400 --> 49:51.479
Okay.

49:59.000 --> 49:59.759
Sorry.

50:00.760 --> 50:01.399
It's nothing.

50:08.720 --> 50:09.799
Thank you, baby.

50:11.840 --> 50:13.359
Ladies.

50:16.920 --> 50:17.879
I have a gift.

50:20.000 --> 50:21.759
It's not worth it. Thank you.

50:23.400 --> 50:26.519
Hey, you want to help
me and talk to him?

50:30.760 --> 50:33.999
Go.
Look at least what it is.

50:36.240 --> 50:37.479
I have work.

50:37.680 --> 50:40.479
- It's not true!
- I just want to talk to you.

50:43.120 --> 50:44.519
Let go my arm.

50:47.120 --> 50:48.239
OK.

50:49.400 --> 50:51.719
- I just wanted to talk to you.
- OK.

50:59.000 --> 51:00.919
What does he want?
It's okay ?

51:01.960 --> 51:04.679
Yes. We will clean it.

51:13.280 --> 51:16.039
One morning I see
her nails done.

51:16.240 --> 51:18.719
There were everywhere on the carpet.

51:18.920 --> 51:19.839
Sorry.

51:21.920 --> 51:22.599
Thank you.

51:26.800 --> 51:29.439
- Do you like to be a mother?
- Yes.

51:29.640 --> 51:31.719
- Yes?
- Yes. That's wonderful.

51:32.120 --> 51:34.679
Finally, it is not
easy every day.

51:34.880 --> 51:38.039
Is not sleeping much, especially
when they are babies.

51:39.720 --> 51:42.239
That does not leave much
time for anything else.

51:46.000 --> 51:46.879
You?

51:47.080 --> 51:50.359
I'm going to college.
So I do not have time for that.

51:52.320 --> 51:54.759
- You still wood.
- No.

51:56.920 --> 51:58.639
I'm not too keen.

52:03.480 --> 52:05.199
- You want to talk?
- What?

52:07.240 --> 52:08.599
Who is the father?

52:19.680 --> 52:20.999
It is a lineman.

52:25.480 --> 52:28.239
It is not even aware.

52:32.680 --> 52:34.239
My uncle hates him.

52:37.360 --> 52:38.719
What you gonna do?

52:41.640 --> 52:42.599
I know.

52:49.920 --> 52:50.799
Your turn.

52:52.760 --> 52:53.799
What?

52:55.920 --> 52:57.239
I saw you.

52:58.640 --> 53:00.959
Getting into a taxi in front of you.

53:12.720 --> 53:14.799
Nothing can hide among girls.

53:18.360 --> 53:20.159
I'll order another.

53:25.920 --> 53:27.079
Go.

53:27.280 --> 53:30.119
- Here we go. Beware of steps.
- Oh yes.

53:30.320 --> 53:33.679
Ready? 1, 2... Okay?

53:33.880 --> 53:35.999
- It's okay.
- Then continue.

53:36.200 --> 53:37.479
One arrives...

53:37.680 --> 53:40.439
Well, well, well.

53:40.840 --> 53:44.319
What beauties like you do here

53:44.520 --> 53:46.639
No men with them?

53:49.000 --> 53:51.479
You know how you got
the feeble air?

53:51.920 --> 53:53.159
Go liberates cowboy.

53:53.360 --> 53:55.359
What if I do not want?

53:56.920 --> 53:57.959
Huh?

53:58.280 --> 54:02.239
So you will continue
to look like a fool.

54:02.920 --> 54:04.679
Come on, it's good.

54:04.880 --> 54:06.039
It's good.

54:06.240 --> 54:08.319
Quick, we not catch up.

54:08.520 --> 54:11.239
I can not believe you're
out with that jerk.

54:11.440 --> 54:13.279
He kept pestering me.

54:14.160 --> 54:16.119
Go, Ron. Leave us.

54:16.320 --> 54:20.399
You should not disrespect me
when I make you a compliment.

54:20.880 --> 54:22.319
Let us pass.

54:23.880 --> 54:24.599
Or what?

54:24.800 --> 54:26.519
I'll blow your teeth!

54:30.080 --> 54:30.919
You the keys...

54:31.120 --> 54:33.359
If you touch her, I'll kill you!

54:35.360 --> 54:36.039
No, Ron!

54:41.040 --> 54:43.319
- This is not Bailey?
- If this is it.

54:43.760 --> 54:45.479
No, Ron! Stopped !

54:46.000 --> 54:46.999
- Stop!
- Bailey!

54:47.200 --> 54:49.679
- Leave him.
- Not stay here, you!

54:50.280 --> 54:51.279
Get out.

54:56.200 --> 54:57.719
Duncan, are you?

54:57.920 --> 54:58.919
- Yes.
- My God.

54:59.120 --> 55:01.959
I'm pissed.
It'll take a long time to heal.

55:02.160 --> 55:02.999
I have it?

55:03.200 --> 55:04.999
Yes, with pleasure.

55:05.200 --> 55:08.039
- With pleasure.
- He'll smash your head.

55:08.240 --> 55:10.079
After, you'll be a vegetable.

55:10.520 --> 55:11.879
It's going! Its good !

55:12.160 --> 55:13.239
This is good!

55:16.720 --> 55:18.359
Get out of there.

55:19.000 --> 55:20.039
You again.

55:20.240 --> 55:22.239
- Bailey, you come home.
- It's not his fault.

55:22.440 --> 55:23.919
Go home!

55:24.120 --> 55:25.079
Come on, honey.

55:39.640 --> 55:41.399
Damn. Warning !

55:43.600 --> 55:44.279
Hello?

55:44.680 --> 55:46.919
Hi. Am I bothering you ?

55:47.120 --> 55:48.239
What is it?

55:48.440 --> 55:49.679
You can see?

55:50.520 --> 55:52.279
I have something to tell you.

55:52.760 --> 55:55.119
See you at our place?

55:58.560 --> 56:00.159
- Be careful.
- Always.

56:29.040 --> 56:30.239
There you go.

56:31.560 --> 56:33.359
This is my last lap moto.

56:33.560 --> 56:35.319
- Why?
- I sold.

56:36.360 --> 56:37.599
I filed tomorrow.

56:37.800 --> 56:39.799
- You do like this bike.
- I know.

56:40.400 --> 56:42.599
It's time to move on.

56:43.680 --> 56:45.519
I'm going to buy a pickup.

56:46.400 --> 56:48.159
And this...

56:50.760 --> 56:52.359
This is for you, for college.

56:52.560 --> 56:54.839
Duncan, I can not accept.

56:55.040 --> 56:57.479
- I want you to guard.
- Do you need.

57:03.400 --> 57:04.479
Why?

57:06.400 --> 57:07.959
I'm not good enough for you?

57:08.560 --> 57:10.519
That's what you think? Not me.

57:10.880 --> 57:11.959
Really?

57:13.320 --> 57:15.999
I'm not just a hobby
before college?

57:16.200 --> 57:18.079
Why do not you want me?

57:24.360 --> 57:26.119
It's just the opposite.

57:29.280 --> 57:30.799
That's what you want?

57:33.040 --> 57:34.159
I'm pregnant.

57:42.080 --> 57:43.399
You say nothing?

57:50.080 --> 57:52.119
Bailey Ginner expect my child.

57:52.880 --> 57:54.919
Bailey Ginner expect my child!

57:56.680 --> 58:00.199
What I want is to be with
you, if you feel like it.

58:00.680 --> 58:01.999
- I feel like it.
- Yes ?

58:02.200 --> 58:03.359
You sure?

58:08.880 --> 58:12.279
My dream may be to stay
here and marry a lineman.

58:19.200 --> 58:23.079
They not maintain the network,
and afterwards, we reproach.

58:31.880 --> 58:33.279
You're very silent.

58:33.800 --> 58:35.359
You told me not used to that.

58:36.000 --> 58:37.359
What is it?

58:41.520 --> 58:42.479
What?

58:48.600 --> 58:49.879
I'm pregnant.

59:01.360 --> 59:02.599
Well...

59:03.040 --> 59:05.959
I'll pretend I had not heard.

59:06.360 --> 59:08.959
You just said you were pregnant?

59:09.760 --> 59:11.199
You're joking, I hope.

59:12.760 --> 59:16.399
But by God!

59:17.600 --> 59:20.039
Contraception, you do not know?

59:20.400 --> 59:22.559
I will not have high like that.

59:23.320 --> 59:24.719
Oh no. It's him ?

59:26.600 --> 59:28.639
It's not true! Is Duncan?

59:29.080 --> 59:30.279
That's what I want.

59:30.480 --> 59:33.639
That's what you want, a poor guy
who has nothing to give you?

59:33.840 --> 59:35.839
- It's not a jerk.
- Really ?

59:36.040 --> 59:37.639
It is a lineman.

59:37.840 --> 59:39.119
As you.

59:40.040 --> 59:41.079
As your father.

59:41.560 --> 59:43.079
As my father.

59:49.760 --> 59:50.559
I love you.

59:52.760 --> 59:55.919
I love you more than anything.

59:57.560 --> 01:00:00.679
But not tell me what I
should do with my life.

01:00:04.720 --> 01:00:06.399
That's what I want.

01:00:24.360 --> 01:00:27.159
I went to my mother on
the day of the storm.

01:00:28.440 --> 01:00:30.399
It must have been a day of celebration.

01:00:31.640 --> 01:00:34.199
I was going to say to
me and Bailey and...

01:00:36.320 --> 01:00:37.479
I do not know.

01:00:38.520 --> 01:00:41.959
Things are not always
go the way we want.

01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:47.519
Alert weather for South Texas.

01:00:52.200 --> 01:00:52.919
Hi, Mom.

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:00.639
You remember Bailey Ginner?

01:01:01.400 --> 01:01:03.279
The niece of Beau Ginner?

01:01:06.800 --> 01:01:08.039
It's pretty.

01:01:09.520 --> 01:01:10.919
It's pretty.

01:01:13.440 --> 01:01:15.319
Mom, she is expecting a baby.

01:01:18.440 --> 01:01:19.079
What?

01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:21.919
We're having a baby.
I'll be a dad.

01:01:22.840 --> 01:01:24.199
You have no job.

01:01:24.680 --> 01:01:27.359
If. Like I said, I'm lineman.

01:01:28.120 --> 01:01:31.199
Your father died without
leaving anything to me.

01:01:31.400 --> 01:01:34.319
I do not even enough to eat.

01:01:34.520 --> 01:01:36.559
I not had enough to get dressed...

01:01:36.760 --> 01:01:39.839
- I loved him.
- Nothing to put you on the back.

01:01:40.040 --> 01:01:43.239
- I'm not my father!
- I do not lift up your child!

01:01:47.480 --> 01:01:49.239
Listen to me, Mom.

01:01:50.800 --> 01:01:52.039
Listen to me.

01:01:53.920 --> 01:01:55.679
Let's get out of here.

01:01:56.200 --> 01:01:57.839
And you're coming with us.

01:01:58.720 --> 01:02:01.719
We'll buy a nice house, and
you're coming with us.

01:02:01.920 --> 01:02:04.199
You're going to be a grandmother.

01:02:05.240 --> 01:02:06.399
Grandmother.

01:02:06.600 --> 01:02:09.479
Do not worry for me,
because it will go.

01:02:10.080 --> 01:02:11.039
Agree?

01:02:34.720 --> 01:02:35.839
Hi, Mom.

01:02:36.840 --> 01:02:37.439
I love you.

01:02:47.600 --> 01:02:50.559
It has winds of 100 km / h south

01:02:50.760 --> 01:02:52.359
And they are gaining ground.

01:02:54.160 --> 01:02:55.999
Teams remain on the ground.

01:02:56.200 --> 01:02:58.039
One must be ready to intervene.

01:03:00.200 --> 01:03:00.999
Warn them.

01:03:01.440 --> 01:03:02.519
You heard?

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:03.839
On the Job

01:03:08.880 --> 01:03:10.479
It'll spoil.

01:03:10.680 --> 01:03:12.599
No way I ride.

01:03:14.640 --> 01:03:16.679
The storm comes from the Gulf.

01:03:18.280 --> 01:03:20.479
It is a few kilometers.

01:03:20.720 --> 01:03:22.599
It will hurt.

01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:24.919
There's no way I ride.

01:03:29.040 --> 01:03:30.759
He fucks what, Eugene?

01:03:37.840 --> 01:03:39.399
What is he doing?

01:03:40.440 --> 01:03:42.159
I do not know what he doing.

01:03:48.480 --> 01:03:49.799
Hi, honey.

01:03:53.920 --> 01:03:55.119
Everything okay?

01:03:56.680 --> 01:03:57.919
Eugene?

01:04:00.600 --> 01:04:01.719
You're still here?

01:04:03.280 --> 01:04:04.519
Yes, I'm here.

01:04:05.560 --> 01:04:07.279
I wanted to hear your voice.

01:04:07.920 --> 01:04:08.839
That's nice.

01:04:10.240 --> 01:04:13.599
Eugene, on the news, they
talk of a storm warning.

01:04:13.800 --> 01:04:16.159
So take care of yourself.

01:04:16.360 --> 01:04:17.679
Yes. I have to go.

01:04:19.960 --> 01:04:21.359
Carline?

01:04:22.200 --> 01:04:23.359
I love you.

01:04:25.360 --> 01:04:27.359
Tell the kids I love them.

01:04:34.920 --> 01:04:36.319
I also, I love you.

01:04:44.800 --> 01:04:46.999
- What is he doing?
- He climbs ?

01:04:47.200 --> 01:04:48.399
It's sick!

01:04:54.880 --> 01:04:57.799
What's wrong?
Is not entitled to mount.

01:04:58.560 --> 01:04:59.599
It is forbidden.

01:05:30.560 --> 01:05:32.559
We have a problem on line 10.

01:05:37.400 --> 01:05:38.399
We remain on alert.

01:05:38.920 --> 01:05:39.679
It happens.

01:05:45.280 --> 01:05:47.559
- It is where?
- It progresses quickly.

01:05:47.760 --> 01:05:49.799
Louisiana is private stream.

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.999
She comes by the Gulf and will
be there around midnight.

01:05:53.200 --> 01:05:55.719
Gentlemen, it will be hot.

01:05:56.080 --> 01:05:57.359
But we trained for.

01:05:57.560 --> 01:05:59.679
I do not want a misstep tonight.

01:05:59.880 --> 01:06:00.919
Not one.

01:06:01.200 --> 01:06:04.199
Care is taken on each other.

01:06:07.120 --> 01:06:08.199
Let the party begin.

01:06:08.680 --> 01:06:09.719
It's gone.

01:06:51.080 --> 01:06:52.599
It is not attached.

01:06:52.880 --> 01:06:54.039
What is he doing?

01:06:54.240 --> 01:06:56.999
Get down!
Order was to remain on the ground.

01:06:58.640 --> 01:07:01.279
Cling, Eugene! Belt up !

01:07:04.200 --> 01:07:06.039
Oh, my God. He will jump!

01:07:08.120 --> 01:07:09.999
Eugene, it will not!

01:07:10.200 --> 01:07:11.519
It remains on the ground.

01:07:11.720 --> 01:07:14.079
Should not go up.
It's forbidden.

01:07:14.280 --> 01:07:16.359
It is not allowed to ride.

01:07:29.280 --> 01:07:30.999
Excavation my business.

01:07:31.560 --> 01:07:34.599
There are numbers of
messages that I do not know.

01:07:35.720 --> 01:07:38.879
This is the friends I made
when you were not there.

01:07:39.080 --> 01:07:41.119
It remains on the ground.

01:07:41.320 --> 01:07:44.279
It is not allowed to ride.

01:07:44.440 --> 01:07:46.879
- The storm arrives. Stopped !
- Eugene.

01:08:05.360 --> 01:08:06.439
What is that?

01:08:06.760 --> 01:08:09.799
We have a problem.
Send a team on line 10.

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:11.799
There's that nice in the area.

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.639
You send it.
Him call me when he is there.

01:08:25.319 --> 01:08:27.559
You know how you got
the feeble air?

01:08:33.040 --> 01:08:34.719
So you continueras

01:08:34.920 --> 01:08:36.599
To look like a fool.

01:09:24.080 --> 01:09:24.879
Hey, chief!

01:09:25.479 --> 01:09:26.679
What we got?

01:09:26.880 --> 01:09:28.759
- You are the team leader?
- Yes.

01:09:28.960 --> 01:09:32.999
The lines are still live.
We can not water.

01:09:33.200 --> 01:09:34.479
I'm on it.

01:09:34.680 --> 01:09:36.599
I call the control center.

01:09:37.319 --> 01:09:40.439
It reminds me of the Bible
passage about Armageddon.

01:09:40.640 --> 01:09:41.839
Damn.

01:09:44.319 --> 01:09:46.559
Guys, take your gear, let's go.

01:10:43.200 --> 01:10:45.079
Shit. Line 6 is touched.

01:10:45.440 --> 01:10:49.999
Beautiful, storm devastates Greensboro.
I have more men to send to you.

01:10:50.520 --> 01:10:52.839
Find a way to turn off.

01:10:54.360 --> 01:10:57.239
Look, find a solution.
It's understood ?

01:10:59.360 --> 01:11:00.639
Watch it to you.

01:11:05.160 --> 01:11:07.599
Gentlemen, we have a problem.

01:11:08.160 --> 01:11:10.039
You can not put out the fire

01:11:10.240 --> 01:11:12.679
As the lines are energized.

01:11:12.880 --> 01:11:15.559
Must put them off.
Is the plan.

01:11:15.760 --> 01:11:18.759
Russell, you supervised.
In case of problems, you warn.

01:11:19.400 --> 01:11:21.079
Pok Chop, Hunter, on this side.

01:11:21.280 --> 01:11:24.319
The train is on,
then one blunder.

01:11:24.520 --> 01:11:27.519
You come with me.
Give me the gloves.

01:11:33.520 --> 01:11:37.199
This is Duncan. Finally, his answering machine.
Leave me a message.

01:11:57.720 --> 01:12:00.439
Get out your pole and
not hurt yourself with.

01:12:01.160 --> 01:12:02.039
Get off the line.

01:12:02.240 --> 01:12:04.839
Go ahead, raise the pin.

01:12:05.040 --> 01:12:07.039
No. Slowly slowly.

01:12:07.240 --> 01:12:08.359
Go.

01:12:08.600 --> 01:12:10.199
Tire it toward you.

01:12:10.400 --> 01:12:11.519
I hold.

01:12:11.720 --> 01:12:13.079
Slowly.

01:12:13.400 --> 01:12:15.439
Slowly. Hold it well.

01:12:15.640 --> 01:12:17.399
Like that. Now loose.

01:12:18.640 --> 01:12:20.639
OK. Its good. Warning.

01:12:20.840 --> 01:12:22.119
Careful.

01:12:23.760 --> 01:12:26.279
You touch anything.
You serve you from your perch.

01:12:27.360 --> 01:12:29.119
- I know.
- Ah, you know?

01:12:29.320 --> 01:12:31.559
You know everything, you.
It can tell you anything.

01:12:32.880 --> 01:12:34.519
You not want to let me go?

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:38.079
You're fucking my pregnant niece.
You start badly.

01:12:41.760 --> 01:12:44.359
Where you going? Where you go ?
Come back here.

01:12:44.720 --> 01:12:46.119
What are you doing here?

01:12:46.440 --> 01:12:48.439
What you got in your head?

01:12:55.520 --> 01:12:57.839
- Want to know?
- Yes.

01:12:59.360 --> 01:13:01.679
It's not me, the problem.
It's you.

01:13:03.840 --> 01:13:05.399
You have no life.

01:13:05.600 --> 01:13:07.359
And you make me sad.

01:13:08.040 --> 01:13:10.919
You cling to Bailey

01:13:11.120 --> 01:13:12.599
Because you have it.

01:13:12.800 --> 01:13:14.399
And nothing else.

01:13:32.040 --> 01:13:33.399
Is that you?

01:13:35.360 --> 01:13:37.559
I sent the kids to your mother.

01:13:38.680 --> 01:13:40.319
I'm glad you're here.

01:13:45.280 --> 01:13:47.719
Arise.
You know what I said.

01:13:48.760 --> 01:13:49.759
Shit!

01:13:52.520 --> 01:13:55.759
Beau is Pok Chop.
A pole fell on Hunter.

01:13:56.040 --> 01:13:58.279
Russell, is a chainsaw.
We arrive.

01:13:58.480 --> 01:14:00.639
Follow the line and
found the breaker.

01:14:00.840 --> 01:14:01.639
Well, boss.

01:14:16.400 --> 01:14:19.799
This is the friends I made
when you were not there.

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.119
Have you spent time with my wife?

01:14:23.320 --> 01:14:25.959
Yes, it was seen.

01:14:26.160 --> 01:14:27.559
With your friends too?

01:15:10.840 --> 01:15:13.639
Te works less fuck, now, huh?

01:15:13.840 --> 01:15:16.159
No, I beg you.

01:15:16.760 --> 01:15:18.559
Leave me, I beg you.

01:15:21.560 --> 01:15:23.479
Let my wife, son of a bitch.

01:15:23.680 --> 01:15:24.519
Shit!

01:15:30.640 --> 01:15:32.519
Okay, Eugene. I'm fine.

01:15:32.720 --> 01:15:33.719
Kill him.

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:36.279
Eugene, no.

01:15:57.800 --> 01:15:59.879
No, Eugene. No !

01:16:00.680 --> 01:16:01.839
I beg you.

01:16:02.240 --> 01:16:03.919
I do not want to lose you.

01:16:06.560 --> 01:16:07.799
I'm sorry.

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.039
No. Put that gun.

01:16:11.440 --> 01:16:13.199
Put it down. Look at me !

01:16:13.520 --> 01:16:14.919
Look into my eyes.

01:16:15.800 --> 01:16:17.279
Look at me.

01:16:18.440 --> 01:16:20.159
Put that gun.

01:16:21.320 --> 01:16:22.279
I beg you.

01:16:22.480 --> 01:16:24.119
I beg you, ask him.

01:16:25.200 --> 01:16:26.519
I beg you...

01:16:57.080 --> 01:16:59.719
Must send reinforcements
to the post 12.

01:16:59.920 --> 01:17:00.999
It's in the works.

01:17:01.200 --> 01:17:03.679
- Send Beau.
- He has a wounded man...

01:17:03.880 --> 01:17:05.679
We have no choice!

01:17:07.280 --> 01:17:08.399
Okay.

01:17:08.840 --> 01:17:10.239
Call the post  5...

01:17:12.920 --> 01:17:14.759
Hunter will get by.

01:17:16.960 --> 01:17:18.599
You got the center?

01:17:18.800 --> 01:17:20.879
All transformers fart.

01:17:21.080 --> 01:17:22.559
The county is in the dark.

01:17:22.760 --> 01:17:24.599
And we are sent to the post 12.

01:17:24.800 --> 01:17:26.199
It is not connected.

01:17:26.400 --> 01:17:29.319
I know. We are asked
to turn it on.

01:17:29.640 --> 01:17:32.319
I not send guys out
there in this weather.

01:17:34.760 --> 01:17:36.199
Viewing Hunter.

01:17:37.160 --> 01:17:39.999
Do you realize what they ask us?

01:17:40.320 --> 01:17:41.879
We're linemen, Beau.

01:17:42.560 --> 01:17:43.999
It's our job.

01:17:45.440 --> 01:17:46.799
You have said.

01:17:48.480 --> 01:17:50.559
Good. That's what we'll do.

01:17:50.840 --> 01:17:52.559
Pok Chop, you're going to hospital

01:17:52.760 --> 01:17:54.719
Hunter in the
meantime his family.

01:17:55.360 --> 01:17:58.079
Russell, you stay here and
you arranges this mess.

01:17:58.280 --> 01:18:00.159
I go to the control center.

01:18:00.360 --> 01:18:02.239
For the post, do you need help?

01:18:02.720 --> 01:18:04.319
I Duncan.

01:18:05.600 --> 01:18:07.399
Let's go. Come on!

01:18:13.560 --> 01:18:15.359
- You call Bailey?
- Yes.

01:18:15.560 --> 01:18:17.279
Here  Bailey. Leave a message.

01:18:17.480 --> 01:18:18.799
Send him a message.

01:18:20.080 --> 01:18:21.999
Doctor, how is he?

01:18:22.200 --> 01:18:24.359
Fracture of the pelvis,
two broken ribs.

01:18:26.120 --> 01:18:28.279
We have a backup power.

01:18:29.280 --> 01:18:31.559
- It was what?
- Pregnant woman 6 weeks.

01:18:31.760 --> 01:18:34.519
Gunshot wound to the abdomen.
The voltage drop.

01:18:34.720 --> 01:18:36.799
She loses blood.
Direct block.

01:18:42.880 --> 01:18:44.479
My baby!

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:49.359
It's okay, baby.

01:18:51.640 --> 01:18:52.799
Voltage how much?

01:18:53.160 --> 01:18:54.439
120  90 and stable.

01:18:56.080 --> 01:18:58.439
Emergency power unleashed.

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:01.439
This is not good, that.

01:19:11.440 --> 01:19:13.959
Take pliers and cut the fence.

01:19:15.840 --> 01:19:17.359
Pok Chop, what's up?

01:19:18.080 --> 01:19:18.679
What?

01:19:19.320 --> 01:19:20.719
I will not hear.

01:19:21.280 --> 01:19:23.319
-... Took a bullet.
- Bailey what?

01:19:23.520 --> 01:19:24.639
We shot him.

01:19:25.840 --> 01:19:28.039
It is  operates.
We're in the dark here.

01:19:28.240 --> 01:19:30.839
The emergency power supply
jumped because of the rain.

01:19:31.120 --> 01:19:32.599
You must restore power.

01:19:32.920 --> 01:19:34.919
We must act quickly, Beau.

01:19:41.400 --> 01:19:42.399
It's open!

01:19:48.960 --> 01:19:50.719
I have something to tell you.

01:19:50.920 --> 01:19:53.639
Will have you to be strong.
Bailey injured.

01:19:53.840 --> 01:19:55.759
She's in the hospital,
no electricity.

01:19:55.960 --> 01:19:57.479
Must restore power.

01:19:57.680 --> 01:20:00.199
We must rescue the girl.
It's understood ?

01:20:00.880 --> 01:20:02.039
Is that understood?

01:20:03.240 --> 01:20:04.559
At work. Come on!

01:20:05.360 --> 01:20:08.119
- We must stop the bleeding.
- We open.

01:20:09.480 --> 01:20:10.479
Scalpel.

01:20:10.680 --> 01:20:12.039
Manual ventilation.

01:20:19.640 --> 01:20:20.999
Beau should be there.

01:20:21.200 --> 01:20:23.639
While the county is in the dark.

01:20:23.840 --> 01:20:25.799
The hospital is without power.

01:20:28.600 --> 01:20:30.599
It would do well to hurry.

01:20:34.440 --> 01:20:36.599
It is in this order: 1, 2, 3

01:20:41.400 --> 01:20:42.999
Good. Go on the third.

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:45.239
I take care of the bypass.

01:20:52.960 --> 01:20:54.479
Why does it not work?

01:20:54.840 --> 01:20:56.079
Enlighten me.

01:20:56.280 --> 01:20:57.519
- It's bleeding.
- Compress.

01:20:59.520 --> 01:21:00.839
Compress.

01:21:01.480 --> 01:21:03.279
I see nothing. Hold tight the lamp.

01:21:03.480 --> 01:21:05.479
Over my shoulder.
I do not see anything.

01:21:06.040 --> 01:21:06.919
Like that.

01:21:12.400 --> 01:21:13.639
I found!

01:21:13.920 --> 01:21:15.119
That's up there.

01:21:15.760 --> 01:21:17.559
- Perch.
- What are you doing ?

01:21:17.760 --> 01:21:19.719
- Give me the pole!
- Wait.

01:21:20.320 --> 01:21:21.799
It's dangerous.

01:21:23.640 --> 01:21:26.639
The continued bleeding.
It not hold. Come on !

01:21:27.040 --> 01:21:27.839
Go, Bailey.

01:21:30.800 --> 01:21:31.719
I have the ball.

01:21:32.120 --> 01:21:33.799
I see where it's bleeding.

01:21:40.120 --> 01:21:41.839
Balance, go!

01:21:43.160 --> 01:21:45.879
Disconnects relays
to remain closed.

01:21:46.080 --> 01:21:48.359
- There?
- Yes, that one.

01:21:56.160 --> 01:21:56.759
This is good!

01:22:04.320 --> 01:22:05.839
Watch out!

01:22:06.040 --> 01:22:08.319
- It loses.
- Proximal control.

01:22:08.520 --> 01:22:09.399
Are transfused.

01:22:09.600 --> 01:22:11.479
Go, baby. Hold on.

01:22:37.160 --> 01:22:39.439
In the event something happens to me,

01:22:39.760 --> 01:22:41.719
I entrust this.

01:22:44.120 --> 01:22:46.679
I'm sorry for having
misjudged you.

01:22:47.720 --> 01:22:49.079
You're a good guy.

01:22:49.440 --> 01:22:50.839
Tell Bailey that I love.

01:22:52.160 --> 01:22:53.999
Take care of the small.

01:22:57.160 --> 01:22:57.759
Wait!

01:23:02.240 --> 01:23:04.519
Wait, Beau. No ! Do not do that.

01:23:08.520 --> 01:23:10.679
I'll drink all that water.

01:23:10.880 --> 01:23:12.599
Who's your favorite uncle?

01:23:12.800 --> 01:23:13.759
You.

01:23:19.560 --> 01:23:21.519
You do not have to worry about me.

01:23:51.120 --> 01:23:52.159
It's income.

01:23:52.360 --> 01:23:53.599
Monitors voltage.

01:23:53.800 --> 01:23:54.999
Nice work.

01:24:22.800 --> 01:24:23.999
Excuse me.

01:24:24.560 --> 01:24:26.119
I am looking Ginner Bailey.

01:24:52.240 --> 01:24:53.439
Hi.

01:24:53.760 --> 01:24:55.159
- Are you there?
- Yes.

01:24:56.480 --> 01:24:57.319
I'm here.

01:25:03.720 --> 01:25:05.599
- Beautiful...
- I'm sorry.

01:25:05.880 --> 01:25:07.559
Come here.

01:25:08.840 --> 01:25:10.079
It's okay.

01:25:11.400 --> 01:25:13.079
It's okay.

01:26:27.640 --> 01:26:28.879
Oh, my God.

01:26:29.080 --> 01:26:30.919
I'm sorry. I did not know.

01:26:32.920 --> 01:26:35.159
How would you describe Beau Ginner?

01:26:37.800 --> 01:26:39.679
The best down the line.

01:26:42.600 --> 01:26:44.919
Ginner Bailey was his life.

01:26:45.120 --> 01:26:47.999
And he hated anyone
who approached.

01:26:48.640 --> 01:26:49.919
Including me.

01:26:52.560 --> 01:26:55.359
Do you want to add something?

01:26:58.400 --> 01:27:00.639
Yes, I would like
to add something.

01:27:06.440 --> 01:27:07.639
I loved this man.

01:27:09.880 --> 01:27:11.439
I respected.

01:27:13.600 --> 01:27:15.559
I want to be like him.

01:27:18.200 --> 01:27:22.399
I hope one day, not match it,
but continue in his line.

01:27:26.040 --> 01:27:28.239
Thank you for your testimony, Duncan.

01:27:29.160 --> 01:27:31.639
I have a few questions.

01:27:31.840 --> 01:27:34.199
It was a storm from the Gulf.

01:27:34.400 --> 01:27:36.839
We need now.

01:27:41.720 --> 01:27:42.919
I have to go.

01:33:17.880 --> 01:33:20.319
