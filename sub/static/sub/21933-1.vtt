WEBVTT

00:01.535 --> 00:03.937
All right, kids, let's go.
Bowls in the sink, come on.

00:03.971 --> 00:06.174
Dad, you have to put
something healthy in there.

00:06.207 --> 00:07.708
(GRUNTS)
There's beef jerky.

00:08.842 --> 00:10.278
Chock full of protein,

00:10.311 --> 00:12.413
and it'll keep them
out of the dating pool
for a few years.

00:13.981 --> 00:16.084
No, you have
to give them fruit.

00:16.117 --> 00:17.851
No, he doesn't.
Yeah, don't let her
control you, Dad.

00:17.885 --> 00:20.521
She's right, all right?
Nobody likes a bully.
Come on.

00:21.922 --> 00:23.291
Okay.
Okay, no problem.

00:23.324 --> 00:24.425
Um...

00:26.060 --> 00:28.229
Who are we?
BOTH: Gables!

00:28.262 --> 00:30.264
What are we?
Leaders!

00:30.298 --> 00:32.600
Who's got it better than us?
Nobody!

00:33.367 --> 00:34.902
And what are we late for?

00:34.935 --> 00:36.570
The bus if we don't
get moving. Now go.

00:37.971 --> 00:39.873
Good morning. Oh, shoot.

00:39.907 --> 00:41.509
Did I miss
the "who are we" chant?

00:41.542 --> 00:43.077
KEVIN: Oh...

00:44.212 --> 00:46.114
Chale, technically,
you're not a Gable.

00:46.147 --> 00:49.117
So when you chime in,
it kind of weirds me out.

00:49.150 --> 00:52.120
I just get caught up in it.
It is inspiring.

00:52.153 --> 00:53.787
Oh, here.
You got some mail.

00:53.821 --> 00:55.589
Oh, Chale mail.

00:58.326 --> 01:00.128
Junk...

01:00.161 --> 01:01.595
You gotta be kidding me.
Not again.

01:01.629 --> 01:02.630
What is it?

01:02.663 --> 01:05.133
(GRUNTS)
It's from your mom's gym.
It's a postcard.

01:06.834 --> 01:08.402
"Haven't seen you.
We miss you."

01:08.436 --> 01:10.738
You know what? So do I.
Okay, you know what?
Give me that.

01:10.771 --> 01:11.972
I will call them right now.

01:12.005 --> 01:13.141
It's been over a year
since she died.

01:13.174 --> 01:14.442
They shouldn't still
be sending this.

01:14.475 --> 01:15.876
That's right, right?
Thank you.

01:15.909 --> 01:17.245
Oh, but don't
throw that out.

01:17.278 --> 01:19.280
On the bottom
there's a coupon
for a kung fu lesson.

01:19.313 --> 01:21.815
I wanna go to it.
Yeah.

01:21.849 --> 01:23.784
Oh, no.
What? What's the matter?

01:24.885 --> 01:26.520
My visa has expired.

01:26.554 --> 01:29.022
It states here
I could get deported.

01:29.056 --> 01:32.326
Wow.
Well, you keep in touch.

01:35.796 --> 01:38.566
Dad, come on. This is serious.
Let me see that.

01:38.599 --> 01:41.702
It makes no sense.
I... I filled out
all the proper paperwork.

01:41.735 --> 01:45.439
You know, you gotta stay
on top of those things
if you wanna be a citizen.

01:45.473 --> 01:46.974
I mean, you could say a lot
about Americans,

01:47.007 --> 01:48.642
but we're not lazy,
you know?

01:50.110 --> 01:52.246
I have seen you watch
Ray Donovan in Spanish

01:52.280 --> 01:54.615
because the remote
was sitting
on top of the TV.

01:56.350 --> 01:59.220
Yeah, and now I know
how to say "get my gun"
in Espanol.

01:59.253 --> 02:01.755
Dame mis pistolas.

02:04.325 --> 02:07.328
Okay, wait, Dad, you sent in
Chale's sponsor form, right?

02:07.361 --> 02:08.929
Remember? I told you
how important that was?

02:08.962 --> 02:10.598
Yes, you told me,
and I sent it in.

02:10.631 --> 02:13.567
You're sure?
I'm positive.
I have my own system.

02:13.601 --> 02:15.336
I take all
the important paperwork,

02:15.369 --> 02:17.070
I put it
right in this drawer,

02:17.104 --> 02:19.307
and then, once a week,
I mail it out.

02:19.907 --> 02:21.242
Mmm.

02:26.380 --> 02:27.615
It's still in there,
isn't it?

02:28.382 --> 02:29.617
It's not a perfect system.

02:30.518 --> 02:35.589
* I am not your
ordinary guy *

02:35.623 --> 02:37.891
Dad, what are we gonna do?
Chale's gonna get deported.

02:37.925 --> 02:40.961
I can't come back in this
country for three "yahs."

02:40.994 --> 02:42.730
Three "yahs"!

02:45.666 --> 02:47.335
How many "yahs"?

02:50.738 --> 02:52.873
I'd have to move back
to Bungleton.

02:52.906 --> 02:54.375
I... I'm getting
a stomach ache.

02:54.408 --> 02:56.244
No, it's gonna be
all right, okay?

02:56.277 --> 02:57.911
We will be together
no matter what.

02:57.945 --> 02:59.513
I will move to England.

02:59.547 --> 03:02.115
Oh, actually,
you'd love Bungleton.

03:02.149 --> 03:03.651
It's out in the countryside.

03:03.684 --> 03:06.520
There's chickens roaming free,
fresh eggs every morning.

03:06.554 --> 03:09.122
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Nobody's going to Bungleton,
all right?

03:09.156 --> 03:10.258
And nobody's eating eggs.

03:10.291 --> 03:11.659
You're staying right here
on Long Island,

03:11.692 --> 03:13.927
where we keep the chickens
in some kind of camp

03:13.961 --> 03:15.329
piled up
on top of each other.

03:16.564 --> 03:18.399
Yeah, well, how are we
supposed to do that?

03:18.432 --> 03:19.900
You didn't file
the paperwork.

03:19.933 --> 03:22.336
Yeah, I know.
I made a mistake, all right?
But I will fix it.

03:22.370 --> 03:24.872
And you know why?
Because we're the Gables!

03:27.908 --> 03:29.910
No.

03:29.943 --> 03:32.413
Because I have a connection
to someone down
at Immigration,

03:32.446 --> 03:33.747
and I'll take care
of it, okay?

03:33.781 --> 03:35.316
Thanks, Dad.
Yes.

03:35.349 --> 03:37.017
Look,
it's all gonna work out.

03:37.050 --> 03:38.419
Because we are the Gables.

03:38.452 --> 03:40.521
Seriously, dude.
You gotta stop that.

03:42.356 --> 03:44.458
Cellucci, over here.

03:46.159 --> 03:47.395
Hey.

03:48.529 --> 03:50.931
How you doin'?
Everything okay?

03:50.964 --> 03:53.166
Yes, yeah.
I'm doin' great.

03:53.200 --> 03:55.503
Okay, good. Well, look at you
with the beard.

03:55.536 --> 03:57.971
Yeah, it looks good, right?
(LAUGHS) No.

03:59.507 --> 04:00.708
You know
who you look like?

04:00.741 --> 04:03.243
You look like the guy,
oh, God, what's his name?

04:03.277 --> 04:04.445
I can see his face.

04:04.478 --> 04:06.980
Come on, you know the guy
from the, um... Ah!

04:07.014 --> 04:08.549
Hugh Jackman?
No. By the way,

04:08.582 --> 04:10.384
I wouldn't think you looked
like Hugh Jackman

04:10.418 --> 04:12.686
if you had claws shooting
out of your knuckles.

04:14.154 --> 04:15.856
All right.
So what's up?
What can I do?

04:15.889 --> 04:19.360
(SIGHS) Kendra's fiance
has a bit of
an immigration problem.

04:19.393 --> 04:21.362
And I remember when we were
on the force together,

04:21.395 --> 04:25.533
you dated a guy, I think he
worked at INS, am I right?

04:25.566 --> 04:26.900
No.
Mmm.

04:27.768 --> 04:29.236
Pretty sure you did.

04:29.269 --> 04:34.808
Okay... I dated a manager
from CVS, but no INS.

04:35.943 --> 04:38.679
Are you sure?
'Cause first,
you dated a lot,

04:38.712 --> 04:41.482
and I just had the feeling
that there was
an immigration guy

04:41.515 --> 04:44.117
sprinkled in there.
Okay!

04:44.151 --> 04:47.588
I think I would remember
who I date.

04:47.621 --> 04:49.823
Oh, Robert. Actually,
you're right, you're right.
Yeah, see? Yes.

04:49.857 --> 04:51.492
I remember. Yes, yes.

04:52.626 --> 04:54.194
Can you do me a favor
and call him?

04:54.227 --> 04:57.898
Oh, call him...
(INHALES SHARPLY)

04:57.931 --> 04:59.099
Oh, what happened?

04:59.132 --> 05:01.869
Um, this one was not me.

05:01.902 --> 05:03.637
This was all him.

05:03.671 --> 05:05.406
We would go to
the Outback Steakhouse

05:05.439 --> 05:09.209
and he would order with
a bad Australian accent.

05:09.242 --> 05:12.079
(IN AUSTRALIAN ACCENT)
"I'll take
the Bloomin' Onion, mate!"

05:13.614 --> 05:16.550
You're... You're broken.
You are so broken.

05:16.584 --> 05:17.951
All right, well,
I gotta figure out something,

05:17.985 --> 05:20.287
otherwise Kendra's gonna
be movin' to England.

05:20.320 --> 05:24.124
Okay, you know what?
I have been blowing
this guy off for three years,

05:24.157 --> 05:26.259
but for you, I will call him.

05:26.293 --> 05:27.495
(GASPS) Oh!

05:27.528 --> 05:30.063
I just figured out
who you look like!

05:30.097 --> 05:31.999
Who?
Pavarotti!

05:37.170 --> 05:38.271
(EXHALES DEEPLY)

05:38.305 --> 05:39.640
Do you think he really
went to the bathroom

05:39.673 --> 05:42.710
or is he secretly running
a background check on me?

05:42.743 --> 05:46.279
Well, he had a key
attached to a giant
wooden paddle, so...

05:46.313 --> 05:48.582
I'm guessing bathroom.

05:48.616 --> 05:50.684
Just stay calm.
Vanessa talked to the guy.

05:50.718 --> 05:52.553
It's gonna be fine.
(EXHALES SHARPLY)

05:55.122 --> 05:56.924
Thank you for waiting.
Not a problem.

05:56.957 --> 05:59.427
Uh, by the way,
Vanessa Cellucci says hello.

05:59.460 --> 06:02.162
Oh, Vanessa.
We spoke on the phone.

06:02.195 --> 06:05.666
Can you believe
she spent three years
helping kids overseas?

06:07.067 --> 06:09.703
She's a real saint, that one.

06:09.737 --> 06:11.539
We're, uh, we're supposed
to go to dinner tonight.

06:11.572 --> 06:14.875
Hey, I hear she loves that
Outback Steakhouse, huh?

06:14.908 --> 06:16.644
(IN AUSTRALIAN ACCENT)
Already made the reservation,
mate.

06:16.677 --> 06:19.480
(LAUGHING)
Now... (CLEARS THROAT)

06:19.513 --> 06:23.316
Let me see if I can
provide some assistance
in this matter, Mr. Witt?

06:23.350 --> 06:25.519
Yes, Chale Eugene Witt.

06:25.553 --> 06:27.421
Okay, I just need to verify
some information.

06:27.455 --> 06:30.157
Are you still living
at 2257 Seville Lane?

06:30.190 --> 06:31.859
Yes.
Yes, we are.

06:31.892 --> 06:35.295
Wait a minute, you...
You live together?

06:35.328 --> 06:36.964
No, he...
He lives in my garage.

06:36.997 --> 06:39.467
Oh, well, it's listed here
as an apartment.

06:39.500 --> 06:40.834
Is this a legal residence?

06:40.868 --> 06:43.604
Legal? Uh, you know,
as far as the permits
and stuff,

06:43.637 --> 06:46.406
I kinda wanted to fly
under the radar.

06:47.407 --> 06:48.476
But it is up to code?

06:48.509 --> 06:50.110
Yes, yeah,
definitely up to code.

06:51.244 --> 06:53.614
It's my code,
but it's up there.

06:53.647 --> 06:55.148
Yeah, same address.
We're at the same...

06:55.182 --> 06:56.717
Okay, then he pays rent?

06:56.750 --> 07:00.053
(LAUGHING) In your dreams.

07:00.087 --> 07:01.354
(CLEARS THROAT)

07:01.388 --> 07:04.424
Why... Why is that funny,
Mr. Gable?

07:04.458 --> 07:06.193
Oh, I'm sorry, it's just
an inside joke we have

07:06.226 --> 07:07.360
'cause he's usually
unemployed.

07:07.394 --> 07:10.498
Oh, well, it says here
that you are employed.

07:10.531 --> 07:14.502
Well, I was. I was working
for a tech startup.

07:14.535 --> 07:15.803
Okay, and how long
were you there?

07:15.836 --> 07:18.371
Let's see...
October, November...

07:18.405 --> 07:20.741
I was there
for a week and a half.

07:23.577 --> 07:25.846
You know, I have some,
uh, some concerns.

07:26.947 --> 07:29.750
Since you are a friend
of Vanessa's,

07:29.783 --> 07:31.451
I think we can extend
your visa.

07:31.485 --> 07:32.786
(CHUCKLING)
(GASPS)

07:32.820 --> 07:35.489
That's... That's a great call
right there, you know.

07:35.523 --> 07:36.824
It's not like
he's a terrorist
or something.

07:36.857 --> 07:38.659
You're not... Are you,
you little terrorist?

07:38.692 --> 07:40.894
(LAUGHS)
You little terrorist.

07:44.197 --> 07:47.167
So we, uh,
do we sign something,
or just we can go?

07:47.200 --> 07:49.236
We're free to go, right?
I think we get out of here,

07:49.269 --> 07:50.804
wanna get some ice cream?

07:52.973 --> 07:56.309
Mr. Gable, I did not
bring up terrorism.

07:56.343 --> 07:57.444
Is there a reason
you did?

07:57.477 --> 07:59.146
No. No, I was saying
he's not a terrorist.

07:59.179 --> 08:00.814
He's harmless. I mean, he...
(EXHALES DEEPLY)

08:00.848 --> 08:03.283
He spends all day
in my garage, right?

08:03.316 --> 08:04.417
Working out those
little formulas

08:04.451 --> 08:05.553
on his crazy
little white board.

08:05.586 --> 08:07.988
Mr. Gable,
please stop talking!

08:08.021 --> 08:09.056
I'll stop talking.

08:12.259 --> 08:15.295
In 36 hours, they can kick me
out of the country.

08:15.328 --> 08:17.064
There's nothing I can do
about it.

08:17.097 --> 08:18.999
Hey, on the positive,
it's nice to know
our government

08:19.032 --> 08:21.201
takes immigration
pretty seriously.

08:22.603 --> 08:24.304
I will take comfort
in that thought

08:24.337 --> 08:25.806
on the barge ride
back to England.

08:25.839 --> 08:27.808
Well, what if we get married,
you know?

08:27.841 --> 08:29.943
That'll make you a citizen.
By tomorrow?

08:29.977 --> 08:32.045
Yeah.
Chale, I love you, okay?

08:32.079 --> 08:33.714
We can just run down
to City Hall and do it.

08:33.747 --> 08:35.683
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a sec.

08:35.716 --> 08:37.718
I realize part of this
is my fault.
Part?

08:37.751 --> 08:39.820
Okay, let's not point
fingers, all right?

08:39.853 --> 08:42.289
But don't you want
to get married the way
we always talked about?

08:42.322 --> 08:45.458
Right? The church,
Father Philip,
your mother's dress?

08:45.492 --> 08:49.429
Yeah, of course, but, I mean,
how are we gonna pull that
off by tomorrow night?

08:49.462 --> 08:52.733
(SCOFFS) We have a whole day.
All right?

08:52.766 --> 08:54.868
Look, this wedding
is happening.

08:54.902 --> 08:58.005
I'm not losing my daughter,
all right? You wanna know why?

08:58.038 --> 08:59.072
We're the Gables.

08:59.106 --> 09:01.041
Exactly.

09:01.074 --> 09:03.844
We're the... Oh, crap.
I missed it again!

09:08.048 --> 09:10.784
No, I need the flowers today.
It's my wedding.

09:10.818 --> 09:14.755
I know it's last-minute,
but is there anything
you can do?

09:14.788 --> 09:16.890
Hey. What's going on?

09:16.924 --> 09:18.258
I heard you're changing
the wedding plans

Father Philip is out

09:45.753 --> 09:47.154
What? No, why can't you
just call him?

I don't know
how we're going to
pull this off by tonight.

do not get upset.

10:06.974 --> 10:08.208
In fact, I think you should
get ready to smile.

I'll fix your dress.

your hair blown out?

I'll blow it out.
I'll blow 'em all out.

I'm gonna go crazy.
I'll pluck your eyebrows.

I'll pluck the crap
out of them. I promise.
You're gonna be fine.

I'll put little Met symbols

18:58.405 --> 19:00.207
Then I took your training
wheels off?

19:00.240 --> 19:04.277
Yeah, and then you pushed me
into the street
without any warning?

19:04.311 --> 19:06.279
Can you ride a bike or not?
(LAUGHS)

19:09.148 --> 19:10.683
We're just missing one thing.

19:11.484 --> 19:13.019
I know.

19:13.052 --> 19:14.821
I wish Mom was here, too.
I know.

19:16.456 --> 19:18.225
She'd be very proud of you.

19:20.260 --> 19:21.461
All right, well,
time's ticking.

19:21.494 --> 19:23.596
Let's get you married,
all right? Come on.

19:26.333 --> 19:28.468
On two. Ready. There we go.

19:30.303 --> 19:32.372
You ready?
Yeah.

19:34.207 --> 19:37.210
(HERE COMES THE BRIDE PLAYING)

19:40.613 --> 19:44.351
I'm really sorry you're not
getting the wedding
you always wanted.

19:44.384 --> 19:46.486
Actually, Dad, I am.

19:46.519 --> 19:48.555
Thank you.
You pulled it off.

19:48.588 --> 19:50.790
(CHUCKLES)
It's not perfect,

19:50.823 --> 19:53.393
but... It's perfect.

19:55.061 --> 19:56.363
Yeah.

19:58.565 --> 20:01.534
Boy, Chale really needs
to tie up the back
of that gown.

20:11.278 --> 20:13.680
Look, I know this isn't
the reception we dreamed of,

20:13.713 --> 20:16.816
but much like the wedding,
it was free.

20:16.849 --> 20:18.518
(BUGLE PLAYING TAPS)

20:20.353 --> 20:23.623
None of my business,
but I would've hired a DJ.

20:26.859 --> 20:29.161
All right, gentlemen,
I'm here to announce

20:29.195 --> 20:31.464
the General has died
of sepsis.

20:31.498 --> 20:33.900
Not the greatest
wedding toast.

20:39.005 --> 20:42.675
Well, look, wedding can't
get any worse, right?

20:43.376 --> 20:45.011
Anyone call a plumber?

20:51.951 --> 20:55.121
* Don't want no sweet perfume

20:55.154 --> 20:58.325
* Shake your thing,
go bust your move

20:58.358 --> 21:00.159
* Do, do, do, do, do

21:00.192 --> 21:02.128
* Do, do, do, do

21:02.161 --> 21:05.665
* Oh, yeah

21:05.698 --> 21:08.668
* Don't want
no high-heel shoes

21:08.701 --> 21:10.970
* I just don't want no...
