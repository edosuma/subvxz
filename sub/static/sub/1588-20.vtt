(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

00:18.118 --> 00:19.653
(BUZZING)

00:19.720 --> 00:22.022
DR. BIGBY: Just 20
more seconds.

00:22.088 --> 00:24.338
(LOUD WHIRRING)

00:27.561 --> 00:29.530
Don't these cookies look...

00:29.596 --> 00:33.067
Well, not that good, really.

00:33.134 --> 00:34.735
Remember those brownies
he made?

00:34.802 --> 00:38.271
Tasted like feet on a hot day.
Okay, where was I?

00:38.338 --> 00:40.541
Oh, yeah.

00:40.607 --> 00:42.744
(CREAKING)

00:42.811 --> 00:47.548
Hamster, I appreciate
your dedication to
this world record.

00:47.614 --> 00:52.152
But, (SHOUTING)
how much longer?

00:52.219 --> 00:54.489
Forty-three minutes?

00:54.556 --> 00:59.556
I think we'll both be happier
with you over there.

01:04.765 --> 01:08.635
Everyone loves cookies, right?

01:08.702 --> 01:12.372
And a little milk
to wash them down.

01:12.439 --> 01:15.209
Oh, but none for you.

01:15.276 --> 01:18.179
Someone's mother forgot
the lesson on sharing.

01:18.246 --> 01:21.349
Oh, no. These are
experimental cookies.

01:21.416 --> 01:25.218
I could never risk them
on you, my friends.

01:25.285 --> 01:26.821
(CRUNCHING)

01:26.888 --> 01:30.724
Just one of these will
hopefully give an
ordinary man like me

01:30.791 --> 01:33.194
super strength!

01:33.261 --> 01:36.129
Which means, I should be
able to lift this.

01:36.196 --> 01:37.665
(STRAINING)

01:37.732 --> 01:41.234
If anything pops out
and falls on the floor,
I don't want to see it.

01:41.301 --> 01:43.169
(DR. BIGBY STRAINING)

01:43.236 --> 01:45.139
(GRUNTING)

01:45.206 --> 01:47.674
Well, yes, thank you.
A second one might help.

01:47.741 --> 01:49.944
(CRUNCHING)

01:50.010 --> 01:53.747
(SHOUTING)
Yes, no!

01:53.814 --> 01:57.384
Oh, oh, oh!
This is bad, bad, really bad!

01:57.451 --> 01:59.386
My back, it's bad!

01:59.453 --> 02:01.355
I'll just go lie down

02:01.422 --> 02:05.425
and give some thought
to the ingredient I'm missing.

02:05.492 --> 02:08.942
Know what I'm thinking?

02:38.959 --> 02:42.129
(BURPING THE ALPHABET)

02:42.196 --> 02:44.632
(SIGHS) I can never get
past "C."

02:44.699 --> 02:49.699
I really have to work on this
if I'm going to get good.

02:50.004 --> 02:55.004
(LAUGHING)
Look, it's a kitty.
Hi, kitty.

02:57.210 --> 02:58.211
(BEEP)

02:58.278 --> 03:01.015
(SCREAMING)

03:01.081 --> 03:06.081
(LAUGHING) Gravity.
Who would have thought?

03:23.437 --> 03:24.937
(LAUGHING)

03:32.913 --> 03:34.413

(BEEPING)

04:51.825 --> 04:53.325
(SMASHING)

05:03.070 --> 05:06.740
Talk to me, buddy, old pal.
Say it ain't so.

05:06.807 --> 05:11.545
-(SPUTTERS)
-I said, talk, not spit.

05:11.611 --> 05:12.661
(BURPS)

05:20.120 --> 05:23.825
(TOM GASPS)

05:23.892 --> 05:28.762
Of course, the super-power
formula need
milk to activate it!

05:28.829 --> 05:30.629
I hate milk.

05:38.605 --> 05:39.055
No!

06:17.144 --> 06:18.794
(SCREAMING)

06:25.886 --> 06:28.322
This totally beats
video games.

06:28.389 --> 06:33.039
My turn to play
with kitty boy.

06:33.760 --> 06:35.696
Hey, not bad.

06:35.763 --> 06:39.900
Watch out, cat.
Here comes the Ratinator.

06:39.967 --> 06:42.169
(GASPS)

06:42.236 --> 06:43.770
(DEEP VOICE)
Mama was right.

06:43.837 --> 06:46.987
Milk is good for you.

06:51.245 --> 06:53.914
I might have had one or two,

06:53.981 --> 06:58.685
or 12 cookies,
I sort of lost track.

06:58.752 --> 07:02.089
I hate cats.

07:02.156 --> 07:03.725
But I'm willing to try one

07:03.791 --> 07:06.526
just to say I've eaten
a little bit of everything.
(CHUCKLING)

07:06.593 --> 07:07.562
(GULPS)

07:07.628 --> 07:12.628
But, first I got to
tenderize you.

07:33.120 --> 07:35.970
Open up, kitty boy!

07:43.030 --> 07:44.380
(PANTING)

08:09.756 --> 08:10.758
(NORMAL VOICE) Oh!

08:10.825 --> 08:12.894
Super strength for what?
Two minutes?

08:12.961 --> 08:17.961
So not fair, I was just
getting to the good part.

08:19.633 --> 08:21.133
(SNARLING)

08:27.107 --> 08:28.457
(BLOWING)

08:37.050 --> 08:38.352
(GROWLING)

08:38.419 --> 08:43.419
Please tell me super-cat's
powers are ending soon.

08:48.329 --> 08:52.099
Oh! Thank goodness.

08:52.166 --> 08:57.166
Uh, does he still
think he's super-cat?

09:04.077 --> 09:06.746
What are you doing?

09:06.813 --> 09:08.415
Yeah, good idea.

09:08.482 --> 09:12.382
Super-cat! Under the desk.

09:15.588 --> 09:18.058
(GIGGLING)

(GROWLING)

09:20.560 --> 09:21.795
Hey!

09:21.862 --> 09:25.012
That record was mine!

09:30.637 --> 09:31.087
Ow!

09:42.950 --> 09:47.950
What in the name of Jonas Salk
happened to my lab?

09:48.121 --> 09:49.824
Well, Bot,

09:49.891 --> 09:54.891
with my back, looks like
you have your work
cut out for you.

09:58.899 --> 10:00.767
(BEEPS)

10:00.834 --> 10:04.434
Oh, yes, yes, very well.

10:07.374 --> 10:09.242
