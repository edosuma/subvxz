00:00.400 --> 00:03.133
You loaned your friend this big trailer.

00:03.200 --> 00:06.100
I never in the world thought
that it would come up missing.

00:06.166 --> 00:08.600
You parked it in a neighbor's driveway.

00:08.667 --> 00:10.400
Yes.

00:10.467 --> 00:14.567
The next day, you open your eyes,
you go outside... no trailer.

00:14.633 --> 00:16.700
Well, I thought he actually
came and got it.

00:16.767 --> 00:18.133
I don't believe your story.

Court, come to order.

00:50.500 --> 00:51.767
Be seated, please.

00:53.066 --> 00:56.633
Hello, Judge. Case #1095,
Boydston versus Nguyen.

00:56.700 --> 00:58.266
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

00:58.333 --> 01:01.800
Mr. Boydston, how long do you and
the Defendant know each other?

01:01.867 --> 01:03.934
Oh, well over 20 years.

01:04.000 --> 01:05.300
[Judy]
Tell me where you met.

01:05.367 --> 01:07.700
Well, him and his father
owned a gas station

01:07.767 --> 01:11.834
and I always like to do business with
small, small time business people, so...

01:11.900 --> 01:14.800
-And?
-And I hired him to work for me

01:14.867 --> 01:17.500
-from time to time.
-[Judy] What kind of work did you do?

01:17.567 --> 01:20.834
Well, we do a little bit of everything.
I wash windows, that's my main job,

01:20.900 --> 01:24.266
but I do handyman job because
I have 13 years experience

01:24.333 --> 01:28.367
in Industrial maintenance and I have
13 years in building maintenance, so--

01:28.433 --> 01:30.266
And what kind of work do you do, sir?

01:30.333 --> 01:35.667
I do landscaping and detail cars and
I'm a little, you know, handyman, myself.

01:35.734 --> 01:40.867
Mr. Nguyen, in August of this year,
you borrowed a utility trailer

01:40.934 --> 01:42.433
-from the Plaintiff.
-Yes.

01:42.500 --> 01:45.000
-Tell me why.
-I was helping a friend move,

01:45.066 --> 01:48.300
and I have, I have a little trailer
but he was moving

01:48.367 --> 01:51.467
probably a five-bedroom house
and I needed a bigger one

01:51.533 --> 01:55.834
so we could get more done.
So, I asked Don if I could use his, uh,

01:55.900 --> 01:59.400
twenty foot trailer,
compared to my five foot trailer.

01:59.467 --> 02:02.633
Had you ever used that trailer before?

02:02.700 --> 02:04.800
-No.
-But you have a trailer that's similar,

02:04.867 --> 02:06.633
-but smaller.
-It's smaller, yeah.

02:06.700 --> 02:09.667
When you're not using your trailer,
where do you keep it?

02:09.734 --> 02:13.767
I have a driveway, and I have
a little spot on the side of the driveway.

02:13.834 --> 02:17.100
It's in the dirt, basically.
I just park it right there.

02:17.166 --> 02:21.166
Do you do anything with your trailer
to secure it?

02:21.233 --> 02:26.066
Uh, no. No, I just, every once in awhile,
I just lay it on top of the tree stump

02:26.133 --> 02:29.266
-where it sits on, you know, the neck--
-Do you have a picture of it?

02:29.333 --> 02:33.100
I don't. I apologize, I don't have it.
But I do have the house and I could--

02:33.166 --> 02:36.200
I mean, you could see
where I would park it.

02:36.266 --> 02:38.867
Yeah, right here.
I usually park it right there.

02:38.934 --> 02:40.066
[bailiff]
Okay.

02:41.400 --> 02:42.433
Where is--

02:42.500 --> 02:44.500
He usually parks it right here.

02:48.667 --> 02:50.433
[Judy]
And whose two cars are these?

02:50.500 --> 02:53.367
Those are mine. Well, mine and a friend.

02:53.433 --> 02:54.934
The blue one is yours?

02:55.000 --> 02:57.967
[Tam] No, the red one is mine and
the blue one was a friend.

02:58.033 --> 03:00.100
Was the friend visiting you? Is that why--

03:00.166 --> 03:02.600
-Yes, yes.
-On the day that you took this photograph?

03:02.667 --> 03:05.100
On the day of that photograph, yes.

03:05.166 --> 03:06.900
And when was this photograph taken?

03:06.967 --> 03:11.767
Not too long ago. I mean,
it was after, after the incident.

03:11.834 --> 03:13.300
How much after?

03:13.367 --> 03:16.734
-That one is--
-[Judy] Ju-- No. Don't say anything.

03:16.800 --> 03:20.734
To be honest, that's a Google,
Google search picture, uh--

03:20.800 --> 03:23.266
I only want you to be
honest with me, Mr. Nguyen.

03:23.333 --> 03:25.867
That's honest, that was just
a Google search picture.

03:25.934 --> 03:28.533
This is a Google search picture of?

03:28.600 --> 03:33.800
Of my house. Those cars are old cars,
two, three years dated back.

03:33.867 --> 03:36.867
But I took it to show you
where I park my trailer.

03:36.934 --> 03:39.367
So, what you're saying to me is,

03:39.433 --> 03:42.500
this is not a picture that you
currently took.

03:42.567 --> 03:45.166
Let us start afresh.

03:45.233 --> 03:46.734
I apologize.

03:46.800 --> 03:49.734
Because when something, I don't know,

03:49.800 --> 03:52.367
the hairs on the back of my neck stand up

03:52.433 --> 03:55.233
if I think that somebody
is pulling my leg.

03:55.300 --> 03:56.934
Do you understand what I mean?

03:57.000 --> 03:59.066
I'm not trying to pull your leg,
Your Honor.

03:59.133 --> 04:00.533
-[Judy] Uh-huh.
-Yes, ma'am.

04:00.600 --> 04:02.066
-You understand.
-Yes, ma'am.

04:02.133 --> 04:04.233
-Great. Terrific.
-Yes, Your Honor.

04:04.300 --> 04:06.333
[Judy]
This is what the case is about.

04:06.400 --> 04:10.066
It is your claim that you loaned
your friend this big trailer--

04:10.133 --> 04:12.000
If was a 16 foot trailer, not a 20.

04:12.066 --> 04:13.800
A big trailer.

04:13.867 --> 04:15.533
[Donald]
Big difference in price, too.

04:15.600 --> 04:16.734
[Judy]
Sixteen to twenty?

04:16.800 --> 04:19.367
-Yeah, the twenties are way expensive.
-[Judy] I don't know.

04:19.433 --> 04:22.567
You'll show me that when you
show me the receipt for the trailer.

04:22.633 --> 04:24.967
-Okay.
-[Judy] He asked you if he could borrow it

04:25.033 --> 04:27.467
to help a friend move.
He did that on what date in August?

04:27.533 --> 04:32.066
He asked on August 14th, 2021,
with a text message.

04:32.133 --> 04:34.800
And, uh, I ignored it. Then, the next day,

04:34.867 --> 04:37.934
he called me and he begged
to borrow my trailer, and I hung up--

04:38.000 --> 04:39.834
[Judy]
Okay, so the next day he called you.

04:39.900 --> 04:42.066
So, he first sent a text,
which you ignored.

04:42.133 --> 04:44.000
-August 14th was what day?
-Saturday.

04:44.066 --> 04:47.934
Saturday. And then, the next day,
he called you.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.500
-Yes, on the Sunday.
-[Judy] And you took his phone call

04:50.567 --> 04:53.166
and you said that he could,
in fact, borrow the trailer.

04:53.233 --> 04:54.900
Nope. I did not.
-[Judy] You said no.

04:54.967 --> 04:57.633
-I said nope, hung up.
-Could you explain why to me,

04:57.700 --> 04:59.200
if he was such a nice guy?

04:59.266 --> 05:03.100
Because I didn't want my fender dented,
I didn't want damage done to my trailer.

05:03.166 --> 05:05.600
I never in the world thought that it
would come up missing--

05:05.667 --> 05:07.934
[Judy] Had you ever
loaned him your trailer before?

05:08.000 --> 05:10.367
-I've loaned him a car dolly before.
-[Judy] What is that?

05:10.433 --> 05:14.166
It's a deal that you pull the front of
a car up on, you can haul it off.

05:14.233 --> 05:15.867
And when did you loan that to him?

05:15.934 --> 05:17.934
Probably three months before that.

05:18.000 --> 05:20.133
[Judy] Did he return it in okay condition?

05:20.200 --> 05:22.700
-Yes, he did.
-[Judy] So, you didn't have any history

05:22.767 --> 05:26.700
of letting him borrow something from you
where he acted irresponsibly with it?

05:26.767 --> 05:29.133
No. No, he brought it back.

05:29.200 --> 05:33.567
So, on what date did you finally say okay,
you can borrow my trailer?

05:33.633 --> 05:35.700
Well, after he texted me
and said "we'll be fine,"

05:35.767 --> 05:37.867
that was his last little prod
to tug at my little heart

05:37.934 --> 05:39.867
and I finally texted him back
on the same day--

05:39.934 --> 05:42.333
-[Judy] May I see it?
-[Donald] Yes.

05:51.200 --> 05:53.900
[Judy]
When he says, on August 14th,

05:53.967 --> 05:59.500
"Hey, Don, can I use that trailer today?
I'll grab parking slabs for you, too.

05:59.567 --> 06:02.934
I think we'll be fine."
And you responded on the 15th,

06:03.000 --> 06:05.166
"If you want to use my trailer,
come and get it."

06:05.233 --> 06:08.867
Tell me about these parking slabs
that he said he would get for you.

06:08.934 --> 06:13.700
If-- I never got 'em,
but I'm thinkin' it's parking curbs,

06:13.767 --> 06:17.000
like you pull up at a grocery store.
But they were concrete and heavy.

06:17.066 --> 06:20.200
He just needed to get rid of 'em and I
could probably use 'em for something.

06:20.266 --> 06:23.834
"I'll grab parking slabs for you, too."
That's not something--

06:23.900 --> 06:28.700
It's like my saying, you know,
I'm gonna grab two light fixtures

06:28.767 --> 06:32.266
and signage for you. I-- There's--
Something went on before this.

06:32.333 --> 06:35.133
So, there must have been a history
with these parking slabs

06:35.200 --> 06:38.800
between the two of you.
But you never responded to him

06:38.867 --> 06:42.433
about the parking slabs,
at least here, what you showed me.

06:42.500 --> 06:44.700
Did you tell him you
wanted the parking slabs?

06:44.767 --> 06:46.867
Oh, he-- In the phone call,
I'm sure I said

06:46.934 --> 06:49.166
if you wanna get rid of 'em,
I can take 'em, I guess.

06:49.233 --> 06:51.667
-I got five acres.
-Do you know what he's talking about?

06:51.734 --> 06:54.367
So that you don't run into
the garage door,

06:54.433 --> 06:56.633
or say, a side of a house, perhaps.

06:56.700 --> 07:01.500
My house is surrounded with trees.
And I make parking spots as we need 'em.

07:02.867 --> 07:03.967
Okie dokie.

07:04.033 --> 07:05.600
[audience chuckles]

07:07.667 --> 07:11.667
Mr. Nguyen, what part of,
I can tell when somebody's

07:11.734 --> 07:14.467
peeing on my leg and
telling me it's raining,

07:14.533 --> 07:16.767
don't you understand?
-I understand.

07:16.834 --> 07:19.567
-[Judy] Don't--
-I know you're good. I know you're smart.

07:19.633 --> 07:22.200
Well, then, I don't know,
you must think I'm stupid.

07:22.300 --> 07:23.400
[audience laughs]

07:26.667 --> 07:27.967

07:42.967 --> 07:46.867
Okay, so you borrowed the trailer. You
used the trailer on the 15th of August.

07:46.934 --> 07:48.967
-Is that right, Mr. Nguyen?
-Yes.

07:49.033 --> 07:52.200
[Judy] And then, when you were
finished using it, according to you,

07:52.266 --> 07:54.700
you parked it in a neighbor's driveway.

07:54.767 --> 07:58.233
Yes, like I said, I've lived
in that neighborhood since '94,

07:58.300 --> 08:01.900
so I know the people around there
and the next door neighbor,

08:01.967 --> 08:05.133
I know him well, too,
so he had no problem with me parking--

08:05.200 --> 08:07.600
-No, not that he has no problem.
-[Tam] Okay.

08:07.667 --> 08:12.400
Did you call him, text him, write him,

08:12.467 --> 08:17.000
go to his home and ask if you
could park the trailer there?

08:17.066 --> 08:19.734
He was working--
-[Judy] Ju-- That's either a--

08:19.800 --> 08:21.800
-I did.
-What is his name?

08:21.867 --> 08:23.834
Oh, I don't even know him by name.

08:23.900 --> 08:27.133
Oh, then I don't believe your story.
Let's understand that.

08:27.200 --> 08:29.066
-I te--
-I've known him from 1994,

08:29.133 --> 08:33.567
-is that what he said to-- Ju--
-No, I said lived there since '94.

08:33.633 --> 08:36.233
Something about knowing
all of his neighbors...

08:36.300 --> 08:39.667
"I lived in that neighborhood since
'94, so I know the people around there.

08:39.734 --> 08:41.967
And the next door neighbor,
I know him well, too."

08:42.033 --> 08:44.166
You know him well, too,
but you don't know his name?

08:44.233 --> 08:46.000
Is that what you're saying to me,
Mr. Nguyen?

08:46.066 --> 08:49.266
-[stammering] I don't know...
-[Judy] Do you know his name?

08:49.333 --> 08:52.066
I'm not good with names.
Yes, ma'am, I don't know his name.

08:52.133 --> 08:53.700
-I'm being honest--
-Who is this?

08:53.767 --> 08:55.900
-[Tam laughs] It's Sandra.
-[Judy] Who is it?

08:55.967 --> 08:57.467
[Tam]
It's my, my wife.

08:57.533 --> 08:59.533
Sandra, what's your
next door neighbor's name?

08:59.600 --> 09:02.266
[chuckles] I'm not sure, neither.
He's remodeling the house,

09:02.333 --> 09:05.600
he just bought the house,
so he just actually moved there.

09:05.667 --> 09:08.700
No, no, no, no. I'm not--

09:08.767 --> 09:11.166
-He's the owner of the house.
-Yeah, owner.

09:11.233 --> 09:16.834
He was renting it to these, uh,
I guess, uh, disabled people.

09:16.900 --> 09:20.233
And they moved out, since
the house was kinda falling apart,

09:20.300 --> 09:23.567
-and he's back, uh, remodeling--
-[Judy] Is what you're telling me,

09:23.633 --> 09:26.133
Mr. Nguyen, nobody was living
in the house next door,

09:26.200 --> 09:28.033
so you parked it in the driveway?

09:28.100 --> 09:31.200
-Yes, Your Honor, yes.
-[Judy] Is-- I just want--

09:31.266 --> 09:34.967
Is what you're telling me, nobody
was living in the house next door,

09:35.033 --> 09:39.133
it was being renovated, so you
used the driveway to park the trailer?

09:39.200 --> 09:41.667
-Because I usually park my car--
-[Judy] Don't--

09:41.734 --> 09:44.433
I don't care if you usually
park your wife there.

09:44.500 --> 09:46.900
-[audience laughs]
-Yes, Your Honor.

09:46.967 --> 09:51.333
Mr. Nguyen, what part of,
I can tell when somebody's

09:51.400 --> 09:54.033
peeing on my leg and
telling me it's raining,

09:54.100 --> 09:56.867
don't you understand?
-I understand.

09:56.934 --> 09:59.200
I know you're good, I know you're smart.

09:59.266 --> 10:01.600
Well, then, I don't know,
you must think I'm stupid.

10:01.667 --> 10:04.767
-No, I don't think you're stupid--
-And your wife must think I'm stupid.

10:04.834 --> 10:06.667
-No. No.
-[Judy] I've been living there,

10:06.734 --> 10:08.700
I know all my neighbors since 1994.

10:08.767 --> 10:12.667
And all of a sudden, there was
a disabled family that was living there,

10:12.734 --> 10:16.867
and now somebody else bought it,
but I knew I didn't have to ask him

10:16.934 --> 10:19.533
because I knew him well,
I know all my neighbors.

10:19.600 --> 10:21.900
Do you understand how ridiculous
all that sounds?

10:21.967 --> 10:23.900
-Yes, I do. I do.
-[Judy] Okay. So,

10:23.967 --> 10:27.333
the truth is always easier.
The truth is easier.

10:27.400 --> 10:31.300
Let's start this process again.
When you finished using the trailer,

10:31.367 --> 10:34.700
you parked it in the driveway next door,
'cause nobody was there.

10:34.767 --> 10:36.500
I knew no one lived there.

10:36.567 --> 10:39.166
Okay! Wasn't that easy?

10:39.233 --> 10:40.934
-[Tam] Yes, ma'am.
-[audience chuckles]

10:41.000 --> 10:44.467
So, Mr. Nguyen, this is what happened.
The next, you open your eyes,

10:44.533 --> 10:49.700
you go outside, no trailer. No trailer.
He said, I loaned you my trailer.

10:49.767 --> 10:53.400
Where's my trailer?
And you say, somebody must've stolen it.

10:53.467 --> 10:55.734
Well, I thought he
actually came and got it.

10:55.800 --> 10:57.900
-Well, but he didn't.
-[Tam] Yes.

10:57.967 --> 11:01.867
What you thought was irrelevant
because it didn't happen.

11:01.934 --> 11:04.600
And both of you filed a police report,
I assume?

11:04.667 --> 11:08.166
I had to go to the hospital 'cause one of
my family members had COVID,

11:08.233 --> 11:10.800
so when he called me on the phone,
asked me if I'd--

11:10.867 --> 11:13.066
Just a second. One of your
family members had COVID

11:13.133 --> 11:15.900
-and you had to go to the hospital?
-Yeah, it was--

11:15.967 --> 11:19.600
He was trying to give up and
they needed my wife to go there.

11:19.667 --> 11:23.600
And she wanted me to go, and if my wife
tells me I gotta go, I'm gonna go.

11:23.667 --> 11:26.467
All I want to know is did you ever
make a police report?

11:26.533 --> 11:29.333
-I did make a police report. Yes.
-That's what I want to know.

11:29.400 --> 11:30.900
-Do you have it?
-[Donald] Yes, I do.

11:30.967 --> 11:32.000
I'd like to look at it.

11:42.700 --> 11:47.266
Sarah, take a look at
a 16 foot Terry trailer.

11:48.700 --> 11:53.233
From what I can tell, the production
of Terry trailers ended after 2009.

11:53.300 --> 11:57.800
Okay, so they stopped production in 2009
on the 16 foot Terrys.

11:57.867 --> 11:59.867
-From what I could tell, yeah.
-[Judy] Okay.

11:59.934 --> 12:02.233
In what year did you
buy this trailer, sir?

12:02.300 --> 12:06.533
The best I can recollect, it was 2007.
And that's a heavy duty trailer,

12:06.600 --> 12:11.500
-not just a regular lawnmower trailer.
-Okay. So, you bought it in 2007,

12:11.567 --> 12:14.934
-so the trailer was about 15 years old.
-Yeah.

12:15.000 --> 12:20.567
Sarah, take a look and get a price for me
on a 15 year old Terry trailer.

12:20.633 --> 12:23.233
-First of all, Mr. Nguyen,
-Yes, ma'am.

12:23.300 --> 12:26.066
either I have to give you
an introduction to the truth--

12:26.133 --> 12:28.033
No, ma'am, let me explain.

12:28.100 --> 12:32.000
When you spoke to the police,
you initially said to them,

12:32.066 --> 12:36.567
that with the permission from the neighbor
at ninth street,

12:36.633 --> 12:39.100
he parked the trailer
on their concrete driveway.

12:39.166 --> 12:44.367
So first, you gave me a bologna story,
then you gave me

12:44.433 --> 12:47.333
I assume, a legitimate story,
when you told me

12:47.400 --> 12:50.166
you didn't know who was living there
because people moved out.

12:50.233 --> 12:55.066
When the police came, you told them
that you had permission of the neighbors,

12:55.133 --> 12:57.900
which is clearly not true 'cause
you just told me a moment ago

12:57.967 --> 13:01.000
you didn't know who the neighbors were.
You told the police

13:01.066 --> 13:04.734
that you had purchased the trailer
the day before,

13:04.800 --> 13:07.867
and the purchase amount
of the trailer was $800.

13:07.934 --> 13:11.900
So, unless this police officer
is psychotic,

13:11.967 --> 13:17.100
he has certain details in here that
he must've gotten from somebody,

13:17.166 --> 13:18.600
he says he got 'em from you.

13:18.667 --> 13:23.934
Whenever I told Don, and he was,
obviously, irate at that time

13:24.000 --> 13:27.300
whenever I told him it was gone,
and I didn't know where it was,

13:27.367 --> 13:31.800
he told me, well, you borrowed it, you
deal with it, you make the police report.

13:31.867 --> 13:34.066
Just a second. What do you mean
you bought it?

13:34.133 --> 13:35.934
-I borrowed it.
-[Judy] Oh, you borrow--

13:36.000 --> 13:39.033
You didn't say you borrowed it.
You told the police--

13:39.100 --> 13:41.467
-[Tam] No, no, I was talking--
-No, you told--

13:41.533 --> 13:45.533
I was saying, when I talked to Don,
and told him about the incident,

13:45.600 --> 13:49.467
He told me, I borrowed it,
it was in my possession,

13:49.533 --> 13:52.800
I need to make the police report.
So, I had to make it--

13:52.867 --> 13:56.567
I don't care if you made the police report
and say I borrowed my friend's truck.

13:56.633 --> 14:01.834
I parked it on a concrete slab next door.
And I borrowed it from him,

14:01.900 --> 14:04.433
so I'm making the police report
'cause it's gone.

14:04.500 --> 14:07.400
Instead of giving the police a story
that you bought it

14:07.467 --> 14:09.834
the day before for $800.

14:09.900 --> 14:12.800
-[Tam] I don't know why...
-[Judy] You don't know why?

14:12.867 --> 14:16.166
I said I'm gonna introduce you,
we're gonna have a party.

14:16.233 --> 14:17.967
I'm gonna introduce you to the truth.

14:18.033 --> 14:19.633
[audience laughs]

14:21.467 --> 14:25.033
It's so much easier when you
get the story straight the first time,

14:25.100 --> 14:27.600
then you don't have to remember.
If you tell the truth,

14:27.667 --> 14:29.633
you don't have to have a long memory.

14:29.700 --> 14:31.266
-I pr--
-[Judy] No, just a second.

14:31.333 --> 14:34.433
If you tell the truth, you don't
have to have a long or good memory.

14:39.834 --> 14:41.367
[theme music playing]

14:46.500 --> 14:49.266
[announcer]
<i>Donald Earl Boydston has accused</i>

14:49.333 --> 14:53.834
<i>his former friend, Tam Nguyen,</i>
<i>of not securing his trailer,</i>

14:53.900 --> 14:55.967
<i>allowing it to be stolen.</i>

14:56.033 --> 14:59.467
Okay. It's so much easier when you
get the story straight the first time,

14:59.533 --> 15:01.367
then you don't have to remember.

15:01.433 --> 15:04.500
If you tell the truth, you don't
have to have a long memory.

15:04.567 --> 15:06.734
-I pr--
-[Judy] No, just a second.

15:06.800 --> 15:10.133
If you tell the truth, you don't
have to have a long or good memory.

15:10.200 --> 15:12.667
Okay, do you have any price at all?

15:12.734 --> 15:15.867
No, it's too hard to tell with
the different specs and years.

15:15.934 --> 15:19.367
-I don't have enough--
-This was a 2007?

15:19.433 --> 15:22.133
-Yeah, I know.
-Do you have any price range at all?

15:22.200 --> 15:26.967
I mean, in the police report that
the Plaintiff filed on the 18th,

15:27.033 --> 15:30.533
the police officer, also,
probably not a psychotic,

15:30.600 --> 15:34.300
says he was contacted by you
in reference to the missing trailer.

15:34.367 --> 15:38.700
He said, the Defendant had parked it
in a vacant lot, unattended.

15:38.767 --> 15:40.433
Contacted him the next day.

15:40.500 --> 15:45.133
Don described the trailer as
a 16 foot black Terry trailer.

15:45.200 --> 15:50.000
So, unless the police officer was also,
again, psychotic,

15:50.066 --> 15:53.367
-you told him it was a 16 foot trailer.
-Mm-hmm.

15:53.433 --> 15:57.533
Did you not correct me before
and say it was a 20 foot trailer?

15:57.600 --> 15:58.967
I did correct you awhile ago.

15:59.033 --> 16:02.066
Well, you should've corrected
the police officer, too.

16:02.133 --> 16:04.400
No, he told you that it was not 20,

16:04.467 --> 16:06.333
-that it was 16.
-It was 16. Okay.

16:06.400 --> 16:08.834
-That's why I have her. Thank you.
-[chuckles]

16:08.900 --> 16:14.266
Okay. You told the police that it
was valued at around $2,500.

16:14.333 --> 16:16.233
Yeah, that was before I did some research.

16:16.300 --> 16:19.467
Well, that's what you told--
So, now, I'd like to see--

16:19.533 --> 16:22.200
-Because he's clearly responsible.
-[Donald] Yes.

16:22.266 --> 16:24.667
-I've got an estimate for a--
-He was negligent--

16:24.734 --> 16:26.900
I've got an estimate
for a replacement trailer.

16:26.967 --> 16:30.300
I don't want a replacement trailer,
this trailer is 15 years old.

16:30.367 --> 16:31.867
He told me he bought it for $1,500.

16:31.934 --> 16:33.433
[Judy]
Don't. Just a second.

16:33.500 --> 16:36.700
Mr. Nguyen, having trouble
with you and the truth.

16:36.767 --> 16:37.834
[audience chuckles]

16:37.900 --> 16:42.033
Now, we're going to fix a value
on this 15 year old trailer.

16:42.100 --> 16:43.533
Not a replacement trailer.

16:43.600 --> 16:45.967
I also added gorilla lifts to it,
on the gate.

16:46.033 --> 16:48.367
-[Judy] You have what?
-Gorilla lifts on the gate.

16:48.433 --> 16:50.734
Do you have a receipt for the trailer?

16:50.800 --> 16:55.000
No, that's... a divorce ago
and many moons ago.

16:55.066 --> 16:56.600
-[Judy] Fifteen years ago.
-Yeah.

16:56.667 --> 16:59.633
Could you find,
not a replacement for the trailer--

16:59.700 --> 17:02.066
-You're talking about a new replacement?
-Mm-hmm.

17:02.133 --> 17:03.834
Well, he's not buying you a new trailer

17:03.900 --> 17:05.667
I'm not asking for a new price, either.

17:05.734 --> 17:09.600
Well, I'm asking you, how do you expect me
to value this 15 year old trailer?

17:09.667 --> 17:13.467
He's clearly responsible for it.
You told the police $2,500.

17:13.533 --> 17:17.200
Now, did he ever tell you
what he paid for that trailer?

17:17.266 --> 17:20.233
-Yes, ma'am.
-Let's start with when did he tell you

17:20.300 --> 17:22.266
how much he paid for the trailer?

17:22.333 --> 17:26.100
After the incident, he told me
he paid $1,500 for it,

17:26.166 --> 17:31.867
and added a gorilla lift that was $300
or $400 or $500, something like that.

17:31.934 --> 17:33.567
But he told me $1,500 on the trailer.

17:33.633 --> 17:36.367
-[Judy] And he added a gorilla lift.
-Yeah, that's what he said.

17:36.433 --> 17:39.400
Where were you when you had
this conversation, on the phone--

17:39.467 --> 17:42.800
It was over the phone.
It was, uh, basically him trying to...

17:42.867 --> 17:45.133
get me to pay for it.

17:45.200 --> 17:47.033
Yes. So, you had this conversation.

17:47.100 --> 17:50.000
You remember speaking to him
about the payment for the trailer?

17:50.066 --> 17:51.333
Oh, we spoke in person, too.

17:51.400 --> 17:53.600
I don't know if we said that
on the phone or in person

17:53.667 --> 17:55.734
Oh, we didn't say that much in person.

17:55.800 --> 17:58.867
Okay, well, so then, I will ask you
this question, Mr. Boydston.

17:58.934 --> 18:03.000
Did you, in fact, tell him
that you paid $1,500 for the trailer?

18:03.066 --> 18:05.000
And then put on gorilla lifts?

18:05.066 --> 18:07.800
-I don't recall saying that, but--
-[Judy] Well, he does.

18:07.867 --> 18:09.767
I don't recall saying that,
but I may have.

18:09.834 --> 18:13.100
Yeah, you may have. I may have.
Well, if you may have...

18:13.166 --> 18:16.700
that suggests to me you wouldn't have
said that if you didn't know that that was

18:16.767 --> 18:19.900
either <i>the </i>price that you paid for it
or the ballpark figure.

18:19.967 --> 18:23.500
Do you remember telling him how much
you paid to have the gorilla lifts put on?

18:23.567 --> 18:25.367
And I don't know what gorilla lifts are.

18:25.433 --> 18:28.033
It's a spring assist on the gate
so it's not so hard to lift.

18:28.100 --> 18:30.033
Okay. Do you remember when you did that?

18:30.100 --> 18:31.333
[Donald]
A couple years ago.

18:31.400 --> 18:33.100
Do you remember how much it cost you?

18:33.166 --> 18:34.300
I think it was $250.

18:34.367 --> 18:37.333
[Judy]
So, $1,500 and $250, is $1,750.

18:37.400 --> 18:40.533
That's what you paid for the trailer.
That's what you told him.

18:40.600 --> 18:42.867
And since you don't remember
and he does remember,

18:42.934 --> 18:46.967
and it could've been, which suggests to me
that it's probably what you said to him,

18:47.033 --> 18:48.767
that's $1,700. Now, do--

18:48.834 --> 18:52.233
The problem with that is, Your Honor,
is you can't replace that for $1,750.

18:52.300 --> 18:55.266
-[Judy] Of course you can't.
-Even used, you can't replace it for that.

18:55.333 --> 18:57.934
-They're going for $2,500 to $3,500.
-I don't know.

18:58.000 --> 19:00.834
I mean, if you buy--
Let's say you bought a ounce of silver,

19:00.900 --> 19:03.033
and the price of silver goes up
to $50 an ounce.

19:03.100 --> 19:05.033
Are you gonna sell it
for what you gave for it,

19:05.100 --> 19:06.967
or are you gonna sell it
for what it's worth?

19:07.033 --> 19:10.033
Well, let me tell you this.
Think about an insurance company.

19:10.100 --> 19:13.300
When you insure your car,
and your car is stolen,

19:13.367 --> 19:17.166
and you paid for your car $100,000,
15 years ago.

19:17.233 --> 19:20.867
And you have both collision and liability.

19:20.934 --> 19:25.600
Do you think that the insurance company
is going to pay you $100,000 for your car,

19:25.667 --> 19:28.467
or are they going to pay you
the current value of the car?

19:28.533 --> 19:30.700
-Well, I understand that, but--
-[laughs]

19:30.767 --> 19:32.400
But the trailers are going up. I mean,

19:32.467 --> 19:34.500
if your car's worth more
than you gave for it--

19:34.567 --> 19:36.633
[Judy]
Oh, if things increase in value, yes.

19:36.700 --> 19:39.200
If you bought a car that
appreciates in value,

19:39.266 --> 19:42.367
then the insurance company would
have to pay the appreciated value.

19:42.433 --> 19:46.066
-But he's not buying you a new trailer.
-Well, I'm not asking for a new trailer.

19:46.133 --> 19:48.500
I'm just asking for a price
that will get me close to where

19:48.567 --> 19:50.667
I can take and add some more
money to it and get--

19:50.734 --> 19:53.600
'Cause if you buy a used one,
chances are you're gonna buy a stolen one.

19:53.667 --> 19:55.633
Well, that's possible.
Maybe you buy your own.

19:55.700 --> 19:57.567
Seventeen fifty,
judgment for the Plaintiff.

19:57.633 --> 19:59.066
[bailiff]
Court is adjourned.

19:59.133 --> 20:00.667
[theme music playing]

20:00.734 --> 20:03.066
I mean, I wasn't trying to lie, one bit.

20:03.133 --> 20:06.667
Anytime you got that little gut feeling
that says, say no. Stick to it.

20:06.734 --> 20:08.934
I called him as soon as
I noticed it was gone.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.433
He said, it's gone.
I said, well, you better report it.

20:11.500 --> 20:15.567
Well, I hope that he's happy now,
and realize I didn't steal it.

20:15.633 --> 20:17.700
Something's better than nothing.

20:17.767 --> 20:20.834
[Sarah]
I actually disagreed with you on that one.

20:20.900 --> 20:25.333
If you're already making the leap, say,
to say that the Defendant

20:25.400 --> 20:29.433
did not exercise the proper duty of care,
and was therefore negligent,

20:29.500 --> 20:33.533
and allowed this criminal act
of the stealing of another's trailer,

20:33.600 --> 20:35.700
I think that the Plaintiff
should be made whole.

20:35.767 --> 20:37.800
He did nothing wrong,
he was not negligent.

20:37.867 --> 20:41.066
He, out of the kindness of his heart,
lent his trailer to someone

20:41.133 --> 20:46.467
who he thought he knew to be responsible.
And with this judgment,

20:46.533 --> 20:49.700
from the little research that I had
time to do out on the bench,

20:49.767 --> 20:52.066
I know that he will not be
able to replace,

20:52.133 --> 20:56.000
or get a similar trailer to his own,
for the judgment that you made.

20:56.066 --> 20:58.667
And I think that he should have been
made whole with--

20:58.734 --> 21:02.033
Not a brand new trailer, but
at least the value of a used trailer

21:02.100 --> 21:04.900
that he could go and purchase and
then he would be made whole again.

21:04.967 --> 21:06.734
It's an interesting argument.

21:06.800 --> 21:10.200
The proximate cause of him
not having his trailer

21:10.266 --> 21:13.667
is a criminal act,
not committed by the Defendant,

21:13.734 --> 21:17.233
but committed by a third person.
Does the fact that it was parked

21:17.300 --> 21:22.500
in somebody else's driveway, did that make
access easier for the criminal?

21:22.567 --> 21:27.300
Could have. I really believe that
what he paid for it 15 years ago

21:27.367 --> 21:33.200
was $1,500. He just put in the special
equipment and he said about $250.

21:33.266 --> 21:37.066
Well, then, I've at least made him
financially whole.

21:37.133 --> 21:40.200
But I understand
and respect your position.

21:40.266 --> 21:43.700
And we'll do a little post trial research.

21:45.133 --> 21:46.767
