I am not lonely because
of the holidays, mom.

01:40.533 --> 01:43.269
No, I don't mind going
to a party alone.

01:44.203 --> 01:45.638
That is the point of going.

01:47.472 --> 01:50.475
No, mom, not so I
can meet someone.

01:50.509 --> 01:52.611
Look, I'm getting
out, I'm going.

01:55.480 --> 01:56.314
Tom?

01:56.347 --> 01:57.382
What was that?

01:57.415 --> 01:58.750
Nothing, it's all good!

02:03.923 --> 02:05.525
It doesn't sound like nothing.

02:06.792 --> 02:08.235
You know that Annie
messaged me like three times

02:08.259 --> 02:10.495
to make sure I'd come?

02:10.528 --> 02:13.832
Wait, did you tell Annie
that she had to make me come?

02:13.866 --> 02:15.201
Did you know that baby carrots

02:15.234 --> 02:17.170
are the same thickness
as a human finger?

02:17.203 --> 02:19.237
We just know not
to bite into them.

02:19.270 --> 02:20.438
Our fingers.

02:20.472 --> 02:22.909
But if we did, they'd have the
same give as a baby carrot.

02:22.942 --> 02:24.743
Now why would you tell me this?

02:24.776 --> 02:26.678
Because that's
interesting information.

02:29.348 --> 02:31.784
Oh, you have ruined
baby carrots for me.

02:31.817 --> 02:34.554
Or maybe I've enhanced them?

02:34.586 --> 02:37.622
Look, mom, I will probably
just stay for five minutes

02:37.656 --> 02:40.760
and never go to one of their
parties ever again, okay?

02:40.793 --> 02:42.295
I'm hanging up now, goodbye.

02:46.564 --> 02:47.766
Natalie!

02:47.800 --> 02:49.402
Your cousin's here.

02:49.435 --> 02:51.570
I know I'm a little early,
but I was talking to my mom

02:51.604 --> 02:54.707
in the car and she was
like, "just go in already!"

02:54.740 --> 02:55.875
Yeah, of course!

02:55.907 --> 02:57.275
Come in.

02:57.308 --> 02:58.443
I'm going in.

02:59.812 --> 03:01.522
Annie is just finishing
some stuff up in the kitchen.

03:01.546 --> 03:03.682
I'm almost
done, I just need a hand.

03:03.716 --> 03:04.716
I can help, too.

03:06.284 --> 03:08.420
She gets a little
stressed beforehand.

03:08.454 --> 03:09.923
I'm totally fine!

03:11.490 --> 03:13.960
Oh, I'm the first
person here, huh?

03:13.992 --> 03:15.437
People usually arrive
around 30 minutes

03:15.461 --> 03:16.429
after the start time.

03:16.461 --> 03:17.729
Then why is it the start time?

03:17.763 --> 03:18.763
Natalie!

03:20.299 --> 03:22.568
Oh wow, I love your dress.

03:22.600 --> 03:23.936
She wears it every year.

03:23.968 --> 03:25.513
Now I would love to chat,
and I promise we will,

03:25.537 --> 03:26.747
but we are officially
running late.

03:26.771 --> 03:28.406
Tom, get the stuff
for the eggnog.

03:28.439 --> 03:29.609
Oh, I can help, too...

03:29.641 --> 03:32.311
Oh, no, no, no,
you're our guest.

03:32.343 --> 03:32.978
How are you?

03:33.012 --> 03:33.979
I'm good.

03:34.013 --> 03:34.914
I am good.

03:34.947 --> 03:36.348
Um, the semester just ended.

03:36.382 --> 03:37.550
- Cool.
- Finally.

03:37.582 --> 03:39.852
And that means the class
I was ta-ing is done.

03:39.884 --> 03:40.685
Cool.

03:40.718 --> 03:41.887
Those kids were sweet,

03:41.919 --> 03:42.821
but they were also
total nightmares.

03:42.854 --> 03:44.389
- Yikes.
- Cool, cool.

03:44.423 --> 03:45.967
I mean, not cool that
that they were nightmares,

03:45.991 --> 03:48.294
but cool that you're done.

03:48.326 --> 03:49.461
Right.

03:49.495 --> 03:51.463
Oh, shoot, I got shell in here.

03:51.497 --> 03:53.933
So, is there anyone
special in your program?

03:53.966 --> 03:56.236
You're are as bad as aunt Beth.

03:57.568 --> 03:58.403
Is there anyone?

03:58.437 --> 03:59.305
Oh my gosh.

03:59.337 --> 04:00.272
I think that's a no.

04:00.306 --> 04:01.007
It's okay that it's a no.

04:01.039 --> 04:02.407
You've got plenty of time.

04:02.441 --> 04:03.921
We were kind of a
weird, cosmic thing.

04:04.810 --> 04:05.811
Oh, no, the dress!

04:05.843 --> 04:06.846
- Okay, oh no.
- Oh.

04:06.878 --> 04:07.979
I got it.

04:08.013 --> 04:08.914
Blot it, blot it.

04:08.947 --> 04:09.947
Yeah, blot it, blot it.

04:10.949 --> 04:12.551
We did say 7:30 on
the invite, right?

04:12.584 --> 04:14.620
Yeah, uh, nat, do
you wanna get the door,

04:14.652 --> 04:15.721
maybe make a new friend?

04:15.753 --> 04:16.889
Gentle!

04:16.922 --> 04:17.857
Yes, I'm a gentle blotter.

04:17.889 --> 04:19.425
Not, don't rub it in.

04:19.458 --> 04:20.834
Honey, I'm just barely,
you can't even see it.

04:20.858 --> 04:22.927
Get a hairdryer!

04:22.961 --> 04:24.663
Hi, I'm Annie's cousin.

04:26.564 --> 04:28.543
They're just finishing the
last touches in the kitchen.

04:28.567 --> 04:29.636
They'll be right out.

04:32.571 --> 04:37.277
So, uh, you can come
in to the party.

04:38.976 --> 04:39.976
Woo!

04:45.117 --> 04:46.853
I didn't get your name?

04:48.620 --> 04:49.620
Doug.

04:50.956 --> 04:53.459
I'm Natalie, Annie's cousin.

04:53.492 --> 04:55.461
You already said that.

04:55.494 --> 04:57.497
Right, cool.

04:58.396 --> 04:59.632
Nice to meet you, too, Doug.

04:59.665 --> 05:01.334
Oh no, I didn't get photos yet.

05:05.370 --> 05:08.973
Okay.

05:13.478 --> 05:14.478
Precious cargo!

05:15.848 --> 05:18.584
Oh no, here it comes!

05:18.617 --> 05:23.422
The eggnog has arrived,
clarkmas can officially begin!

05:23.454 --> 05:26.024
It's raw eggs, right?

05:26.057 --> 05:27.593
And like, a gallon of booze.

05:27.625 --> 05:29.094
Make sure people take pictures.

05:29.127 --> 05:30.729
They're memories!

05:30.762 --> 05:31.596
Okay, all right, get in there.

05:31.629 --> 05:32.699
Come on, here we go.

05:33.999 --> 05:36.336
Okay, all right, you guys next?

05:41.740 --> 05:42.975
Saw you met Doug.

05:43.007 --> 05:45.577
Oh, he mostly ate
hors d'oeuvres at me.

05:45.610 --> 05:48.613
I think he spat some
gingerbread man on my face.

05:48.646 --> 05:50.783
It seemed like maybe you
two were hitting it off.

05:50.815 --> 05:51.950
I'm kidding, I'm kidding!

05:51.983 --> 05:53.451
I just want to make
sure you mingle.

05:53.485 --> 05:54.920
I'm doing just fine.

05:54.952 --> 05:57.356
Refilling the gingerbread, duck!

05:58.456 --> 05:59.558
Okay, so, see?

06:04.562 --> 06:05.897
Hey, buddy.

06:05.930 --> 06:08.367
What?

06:09.535 --> 06:10.569
You made it!

06:10.601 --> 06:11.736
How was the drive up?

06:11.769 --> 06:13.104
Oh, not too bad.

06:13.137 --> 06:15.840
Fun fact, I might be moving
up here in a few weeks.

06:15.874 --> 06:17.676
No kidding, new job?

06:17.709 --> 06:18.911
Same job, new office.

06:18.944 --> 06:21.547
They're putting a branch
in Marina del Rey.

06:21.579 --> 06:23.449
Who knows, maybe I'll
become one of those guys

06:23.482 --> 06:24.617
who lives on a boat?

06:24.649 --> 06:25.826
You would be a guy
that lives on a boat.

06:25.850 --> 06:27.161
I would be a guy that
lives on a boat, yeah.

06:27.185 --> 06:29.621
Annie, look who finally
made it this year!

06:29.654 --> 06:30.922
- Hi, hello!
- How are you?

06:30.956 --> 06:31.824
I'm good!

06:31.857 --> 06:32.925
Oh, get him some eggnog.

06:32.958 --> 06:34.894
You trying to make me fat?

06:34.927 --> 06:35.927
I do what I can.

06:36.829 --> 06:38.963
Oh, Logan, you have to
meet my cousin, Natalie.

06:38.997 --> 06:40.633
Yes.

06:40.665 --> 06:42.435
She was here a second ago.

06:54.146 --> 06:56.649
Uh, oh, looking at the pictures.

06:56.682 --> 06:58.451
See that picture of me?

06:58.483 --> 06:59.984
My cat died after that one.

07:00.017 --> 07:00.819
Really?

07:00.853 --> 07:01.787
Yeah.

07:01.819 --> 07:02.754
You look so happy, though.

07:02.788 --> 07:04.098
They really take these
parties very seriously.

07:04.122 --> 07:06.125
Yeah, this is my 4th one.

07:06.158 --> 07:07.526
Is this your first one?

07:07.559 --> 07:09.170
Yeah, I just, I moved
to la for grad school.

07:09.194 --> 07:11.197
Grad school!

07:11.230 --> 07:13.232
I remember those graduate years.

07:13.264 --> 07:16.735
Just wandering them halls,
just walking around,

07:16.767 --> 07:19.571
no student loans, no debt.

07:26.077 --> 07:29.080
Does your school have
lions in front of it?

07:29.113 --> 07:30.815
- Lions?
- Lions.

07:30.848 --> 07:35.086
A good grad school needs good
lions just in front of it.

07:35.120 --> 07:36.923
So you know it's good education.

07:39.124 --> 07:42.161
We should have made these
before people got here!

07:42.194 --> 07:43.562
They would have been cold.

07:43.595 --> 07:45.164
That's why we don't do hot apps.

07:45.197 --> 07:46.564
You love hot apps.

07:46.598 --> 07:48.968
Yeah, when someone
else is making them.

07:49.999 --> 07:51.211
There's no need to
over-complicate our parties.

07:51.235 --> 07:53.671
This was a small upgrade.

07:53.704 --> 07:54.906
We get better every year.

07:54.939 --> 07:55.774
Here we go.

07:55.807 --> 07:56.742
Ally-oop.

07:56.774 --> 07:57.774
Hot apps.

08:07.718 --> 08:08.930
Well, at least
I'm not the only one

08:08.954 --> 08:10.523
that got the ugly sweater memo.

08:12.757 --> 08:15.593
You must be Tom's
high school friend.

08:15.627 --> 08:17.162
The outspoken one?

08:17.194 --> 08:19.298
Junior high.

08:19.331 --> 08:20.766
Oh, okay.

08:21.833 --> 08:23.536
Close.

08:23.569 --> 08:24.569
I'm Natalie.

08:25.737 --> 08:28.107
And you don't know anyone
at this party, Natalie.

08:28.139 --> 08:29.675
What's my tell?

08:29.708 --> 08:30.884
The way you're downing
that drink while pretending

08:30.908 --> 08:33.177
to be interested in
Tom's graphic novels.

08:33.211 --> 08:34.211
Okay.

08:35.013 --> 08:36.581
Well, what's your excuse?

08:36.615 --> 08:39.284
I'm merely an observer of
this grand social experiment.

08:39.317 --> 08:41.019
Ah, so you're
just here to judge?

08:41.052 --> 08:43.621
Yeah, it did kind of win you
over with the sweater line.

08:43.654 --> 08:45.190
Hm, keep telling yourself that.

08:46.057 --> 08:47.293
So this is going really well.

08:47.326 --> 08:48.961
Ah, you're really perceptive!

08:50.328 --> 08:52.130
What do you do, Natalie?

08:52.163 --> 08:53.064
I didn't get your name.

08:53.097 --> 08:54.032
Don't change the subject.

08:54.066 --> 08:55.167
What do you do?

08:55.200 --> 08:57.603
I'm in grad school
for psychology.

08:57.635 --> 08:59.004
Huh, wow.

08:59.037 --> 08:59.872
Go figure.

08:59.904 --> 09:00.872
Oh...

09:00.905 --> 09:02.106
No, I'm impressed.

09:02.139 --> 09:04.043
That's genuinely very cool.

09:10.014 --> 09:10.848
What?

09:10.881 --> 09:12.050
Nothing.

09:12.083 --> 09:13.952
I'm just waiting for
your snarky comeback.

09:13.985 --> 09:15.086
Wow.

09:16.087 --> 09:17.655
You've got my number already.

09:17.688 --> 09:19.692
You're gonna be really
good at this shrink thing.

09:19.725 --> 09:20.960
Thank you.

09:20.993 --> 09:22.728
Yeah, I'm already
psychoanalyzing you.

09:22.760 --> 09:25.063
Many have tried,
none have succeeded.

09:25.096 --> 09:26.331
Oh, is that a challenge?

09:35.106 --> 09:36.841
You don't want
another drink, do you?

09:39.745 --> 09:41.647
You're aggressive
for a psyche major.

09:41.679 --> 09:43.582
You're projecting
your own desires.

09:44.716 --> 09:46.851
Okay, my plan would
be to just get rid

09:46.884 --> 09:48.086
of highway patrol all together

09:48.120 --> 09:50.722
and just put like tow
trucks at every exit.

09:50.755 --> 09:52.957
Just take them
straight to the garage.

09:52.990 --> 09:53.826
I'm not sure that's how, I...

09:53.859 --> 09:55.259
Big stop, ready to go.

09:55.293 --> 09:56.828
Just done and done.

09:56.861 --> 09:58.873
How many times has your
car broken down on a freeway?

09:58.897 --> 10:01.033
Like, 10, 15 times.

10:04.936 --> 10:06.138
Come on, you're taking to long.

10:06.171 --> 10:07.006
One minute.

10:07.038 --> 10:08.307
Only a minute?

10:09.408 --> 10:10.408
Tom, Tom!

10:11.777 --> 10:14.814
I've got an extinguisher
in my apartment!

10:15.714 --> 10:17.249
There's nothing in the oven,

10:17.282 --> 10:18.216
but the smoke just keeps coming!

10:18.250 --> 10:19.951
Okay, did you try water?

10:19.985 --> 10:21.220
Yeah, I did, I tried water.

10:21.253 --> 10:22.254
Sorry, all right.

10:22.287 --> 10:23.122
Fill this, fill this.

10:23.154 --> 10:24.122
Sorry.

10:24.155 --> 10:24.989
Did I do that?

10:25.023 --> 10:26.024
No, I don't know.

10:27.158 --> 10:29.861
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.

10:31.129 --> 10:32.730
Wait, what is that?

10:32.764 --> 10:33.865
You smell that?

10:33.899 --> 10:35.067
Excuse me?

10:35.100 --> 10:36.134
What is that smell?

10:36.168 --> 10:37.168
Oh shit!

10:38.135 --> 10:39.437
- Oh shit!
- Oh my god!

10:39.471 --> 10:41.407
- Oh my god!
- Well don't panic.

10:41.440 --> 10:43.042
Well that's really
not helpful, is it?

10:43.075 --> 10:46.145
Oh, I got it, I got it, yeah.

10:46.177 --> 10:48.112
Oh, you think
that's gonna save us?

10:48.145 --> 10:49.423
Well, I don't see
you doing anything.

10:49.447 --> 10:51.182
You can fit through
that window, right?

10:52.116 --> 10:53.193
What do you mean, can I fit?

10:53.217 --> 10:54.086
Can you fit?

10:54.119 --> 10:54.952
Come on!

10:54.985 --> 10:55.987
I'm saving our lives.

10:56.020 --> 10:58.056
You go first, I've got you.

10:58.090 --> 10:59.892
All right, here we go.

10:59.924 --> 11:01.134
I'm a little afraid of
heights, by the way.

11:01.158 --> 11:02.235
They live on the first floor.

11:02.259 --> 11:03.428
Yeah, you're right.

11:03.461 --> 11:04.639
Sorry about
the hands on the butt.

11:04.663 --> 11:06.407
Don't worry about
being a gentleman right now.

11:06.431 --> 11:07.733
Okay.

11:07.765 --> 11:08.775
- You got it?
- Yeah, I think so.

11:08.799 --> 11:09.799
- You good?
- Yeah.

11:12.336 --> 11:14.807
Sorry Santa.

11:16.942 --> 11:18.143
Started yoga.

11:18.176 --> 11:20.045
Yeah, it does help.

11:22.813 --> 11:23.448
Are you okay?

11:23.481 --> 11:24.315
Yeah, are you?

11:24.349 --> 11:25.484
Yeah.

11:25.517 --> 11:28.220
Let's go see if Tom
and Annie are up there.

11:31.288 --> 11:32.423
Oh my god.

11:32.456 --> 11:35.093
Really could have used
the bathroom, Logan.

11:35.126 --> 11:36.828
Cliff had to let me use his.

11:39.464 --> 11:40.966
So it's Logan, right?

11:41.932 --> 11:42.932
Huh.

11:45.035 --> 11:46.738
I'm just so humiliated.

11:46.772 --> 11:48.741
Oh honey, these things happen.

11:48.774 --> 11:50.083
When was the last
time you were at a party

11:50.107 --> 11:51.743
where the fire
department was called?

11:51.777 --> 11:53.312
Okay, at least it
was a kitchen fire?

11:53.345 --> 11:54.747
If it had happened near a tree

11:54.779 --> 11:56.247
it could have been
really dangerous.

11:56.280 --> 11:58.483
It's true, trees
go up in seconds.

11:58.517 --> 12:00.085
Have you seen those videos?

12:00.118 --> 12:01.487
Would you want
one of your clients

12:01.519 --> 12:03.130
to be known as the person
with the kitchen fire?

12:03.154 --> 12:05.124
Okay, that's besides the point.

12:05.157 --> 12:06.358
It would never happen.

12:06.390 --> 12:08.159
But if it did happen,
I would turn it around

12:08.192 --> 12:10.294
and maybe add a catch
phrase or something.

12:10.327 --> 12:12.029
Arson Annie?

12:12.062 --> 12:13.331
Okay, not that one.

12:13.365 --> 12:14.875
This one is so
awesome, it just, whoosh,

12:14.899 --> 12:17.235
it just goes up so fast.

12:17.269 --> 12:18.336
They say I saved the day.

12:21.239 --> 12:24.243
All right, ma'am, everything's
under control in there,

12:24.275 --> 12:26.310
but pretty smokey, so
I'd leave the windows

12:26.344 --> 12:27.479
and doors open for awhile.

12:27.511 --> 12:28.513
How long awhile?

12:28.547 --> 12:30.382
I don't know, an hour, maybe?

12:30.414 --> 12:31.516
And between you and me,

12:31.549 --> 12:34.285
don't store potholders
under the oven.

12:38.889 --> 12:40.458
You should know,
I've never done this,

12:40.491 --> 12:41.860
not even in college.

12:43.061 --> 12:45.096
Wait, should I be
telling you that?

12:45.129 --> 12:46.398
Nah, you couldn't resist me

12:46.431 --> 12:48.267
from the moment I
started talking to you.

12:48.299 --> 12:50.269
Oh, you need to stop
saying shit like that.

12:50.302 --> 12:51.479
I tee you up to
say something sweet

12:51.503 --> 12:53.839
and then you say
the grossest things.

12:53.871 --> 12:57.308
You didn't think that
twenty minutes ago.

12:58.475 --> 13:01.813
Wait, do you have
plans for new year's?

13:01.846 --> 13:06.184
Ah, you know, they're
kind of still up in the air.

13:06.217 --> 13:08.920
Do you think Tom and Annie
were trying to set us up?

13:10.322 --> 13:11.889
I don't know.

13:11.923 --> 13:13.100
I mean, they think there's
something wrong with you

13:13.124 --> 13:15.594
if you haven't latched on to
a mate and committed yourself

13:15.626 --> 13:17.128
to someone by now, so.

13:18.462 --> 13:21.165
You haven't been in many
longterm relationships?

13:21.198 --> 13:23.034
What does that mean?

13:23.067 --> 13:24.067
Just a guess.

13:25.537 --> 13:27.605
I've had some long-ish
relationships, okay?

13:27.639 --> 13:29.908
No judgment from me, okay?

13:29.941 --> 13:32.110
Tom and Annie married
their college sweetheart.

13:32.143 --> 13:33.386
Why would you settle
if you don't even know

13:33.410 --> 13:35.246
what's out there
in the first place?

13:36.615 --> 13:39.084
I don't need like a
smorgasbord or something.

13:41.219 --> 13:43.188
And what exactly
are you getting at?

13:43.221 --> 13:46.291
I don't know, Mr.
my-plans-are-up-in-the-air.

13:46.323 --> 13:51.062
Bet no guy is
ever good enough for you.

13:51.096 --> 13:52.464
Do you ever let anyone in?

13:52.496 --> 13:54.532
I mean, you hide behind
these cynical comments,

13:54.566 --> 13:56.335
hoping nobody ever
sees the real you.

13:56.368 --> 13:58.971
I mean, I barely know you,
but it feels like nobody does.

13:59.004 --> 14:00.648
Insulting a guy is a great
way to get to know him.

14:00.672 --> 14:02.515
Oh, well ladies love it
when they hook up with a guy

14:02.539 --> 14:04.942
who then proceeds to analyze
their dating history.

14:04.975 --> 14:06.345
It's a real turn on for a guy

14:06.378 --> 14:09.381
when a girl says how no guy's
ever good enough for her.

14:09.413 --> 14:11.482
That's an anecdote you
should save for more parties.

14:11.515 --> 14:13.485
I think we're done here.

14:13.518 --> 14:14.353
Oh come on.

14:14.385 --> 14:15.586
You started it.

14:15.620 --> 14:17.556
We can just forget
this happened.

14:17.589 --> 14:18.624
Dance party!

14:18.657 --> 14:20.225
I'm so not a dancer.

14:20.258 --> 14:21.426
I'd take her word for it.

14:21.458 --> 14:23.160
Okay. I braved the
smoke for these guys.

14:23.193 --> 14:24.362
Come on.

14:24.395 --> 14:25.429
Jello shots!

14:25.462 --> 14:26.298
Come on.

14:26.331 --> 14:27.164
Come on.

14:27.197 --> 14:28.033
Come on, ah-ha.

14:28.066 --> 14:29.066
Come on.

asking, it's my mother.

15:32.596 --> 15:34.432
Since I'm not
procreating, she's hoping

15:34.466 --> 15:37.469
that someone from the family
can take one for the team.

15:37.501 --> 15:39.170
It's not that
we're against kids.

15:39.203 --> 15:41.472
We just aren't
ready for one yet.

15:41.505 --> 15:43.307
Besides Tom and I
were practically kids

15:43.341 --> 15:46.043
when we started
dating and you know,

15:46.076 --> 15:47.245
we have plenty of time.

15:47.278 --> 15:50.048
Yeah, your eggs are gonna
be good for at least a decade.

15:50.081 --> 15:51.984
Probably exactly a decade.

15:52.017 --> 15:54.119
I am not that
much older than you.

15:54.152 --> 15:56.588
I know. But we've established
that I'm a lost cause.

15:56.620 --> 15:59.156
You rule people out before
you give them a fair chance.

15:59.190 --> 16:00.559
That is patently untrue.

16:00.591 --> 16:01.994
World of warcraft
credit card guy.

16:02.027 --> 16:02.661
Red flag.

16:02.693 --> 16:03.594
Organic deodorant man.

16:03.628 --> 16:05.197
Yuck!

16:05.230 --> 16:06.706
The optometrist with the
competitive laser tag team?

16:06.730 --> 16:08.066
Hard pass.

16:08.099 --> 16:09.768
Tom has plenty of weird hobbies.

16:09.801 --> 16:11.703
Remember his
ventriloquist phase?

16:11.735 --> 16:13.471
I'm not having this
conversation with you.

16:13.504 --> 16:14.706
Neither am I.

16:16.508 --> 16:18.176
You'll find someone.

16:18.208 --> 16:19.744
You just have to be open to it.

16:19.778 --> 16:21.621
You will find them when
you're least expecting it.

16:21.645 --> 16:23.014
What do you know?

16:23.048 --> 16:23.648
I mean, you guys met
when you were kids.

16:23.681 --> 16:24.516
Exactly.

16:24.548 --> 16:26.217
We weren't expecting it.

16:26.250 --> 16:27.418
I can get it.

16:27.451 --> 16:28.285
Tom will get it.

16:28.318 --> 16:29.553
Tom?

16:29.586 --> 16:31.322
I'm cleaning out the bathtub.

16:31.355 --> 16:34.192
I thought you were gonna do
that when I started cooking?

16:34.225 --> 16:36.695
I had to create a new playlist.

16:36.727 --> 16:38.229
I can get it, seriously.

16:41.533 --> 16:45.370
Oh, hi.

16:45.403 --> 16:46.772
Hi.

16:46.804 --> 16:48.106
I'm the first one here?

16:49.506 --> 16:50.808
Ah, no.

16:50.841 --> 16:52.811
I already got that title.

16:52.844 --> 16:53.844
Logan.

16:55.279 --> 16:56.113
I know.

16:56.147 --> 16:57.682
Ha, ha, ha, Logan!

16:58.817 --> 17:00.384
Wait, where's the ice?

17:00.418 --> 17:02.163
Oh shit, I knew there
was a reason I left early.

17:02.187 --> 17:03.621
Sorry dude, I ubered.

17:03.654 --> 17:05.523
Wait, he didn't bring the ice?

17:05.557 --> 17:07.726
But we need a
bunch of bags, Tom.

17:07.759 --> 17:09.326
Listen, I'll just
go out and get it.

17:09.359 --> 17:10.737
I'm sure there's a grocery
store around the corner.

17:10.761 --> 17:12.129
That's great.

17:12.163 --> 17:13.531
Wait, will she get back in time?

17:13.565 --> 17:14.432
The sooner she
leaves the better.

17:14.465 --> 17:15.599
I'll be fine.

17:15.633 --> 17:16.677
But how can she carry it all?

17:16.701 --> 17:18.403
We need a bunch of bags, Tom?

17:18.435 --> 17:20.271
What if Logan goes with Natalie

17:20.305 --> 17:21.549
and then they can carry
the bags together?

17:21.573 --> 17:22.740
That's perfect.

17:25.143 --> 17:26.211
Great.

17:26.243 --> 17:27.778
We'll go get the ice.

17:27.811 --> 17:28.811
Together.

17:44.394 --> 17:45.529
I'm sorry.

17:45.563 --> 17:47.283
I didn't know anyone
would be sitting there.

17:49.299 --> 17:50.701
You are quite the hoarder.

17:50.734 --> 17:52.203
That is hardly hoarding.

17:52.237 --> 17:53.338
Oh, pardon me.

17:53.371 --> 17:55.107
It's just the back
issues of old magazines

17:55.140 --> 17:57.576
and a bunch of half
drunken water bottles.

17:57.608 --> 17:59.711
If there's an earthquake,
I will have water.

17:59.743 --> 18:01.612
I'll be sure to find
you in the grid goes down.

18:01.645 --> 18:02.790
You didn't have to come with me.

18:02.814 --> 18:04.283
I don't know why you did.

18:06.784 --> 18:09.153
Geez, did you see this
one about the fault line

18:09.186 --> 18:10.521
in the pacific northwest?

18:10.555 --> 18:13.291
They are screwed.

18:13.324 --> 18:15.727
You're really not going
to say anything, are you?

18:15.759 --> 18:16.627
Unbelievable.

18:16.661 --> 18:18.596
Last clarkmas?

18:18.630 --> 18:20.165
We hooked up!

18:20.198 --> 18:22.634
Oh man, the
captions on these cartoons

18:22.666 --> 18:24.235
gets me every time.

18:24.269 --> 18:26.605
I know that I've seen you
around town several times

18:26.637 --> 18:28.740
and every single time
you've avoided me.

18:28.772 --> 18:30.509
Once at the arclight and twice

18:30.541 --> 18:31.876
at the third street promenade.

18:31.910 --> 18:32.878
Look, I don't know.

18:32.911 --> 18:34.246
I know it was you.

18:34.278 --> 18:36.448
Maybe you just wanted to see me.

18:36.480 --> 18:38.817
Isn't there a psychological
term for that?

18:38.849 --> 18:40.519
The only term that is coming

18:40.551 --> 18:42.553
to my mind right now is asshole.

18:42.586 --> 18:44.588
What, I'm supposed to
remember every random hookup?

18:44.622 --> 18:49.628
Oh, we had a conversation.

18:50.295 --> 18:51.229
Perhaps.

18:51.261 --> 18:52.261
Oh shit, the supermarket.

18:52.829 --> 18:53.829
Sorry.

19:04.576 --> 19:06.912
Hey, any of these
spots would work.

19:06.944 --> 19:09.147
I'm finding a spot
near the entrance.

19:10.248 --> 19:11.750
Still don't know how to settle.

19:12.817 --> 19:14.219
All right.

19:14.251 --> 19:16.788
I am officially taking
the higher road here.

19:16.820 --> 19:18.322
We can start over.

19:18.355 --> 19:19.724
Like nothing happened.

19:20.724 --> 19:21.792
Nothing did happen.

19:22.859 --> 19:23.761
Great.

19:23.795 --> 19:24.829
Fantastic.

19:24.862 --> 19:26.364
Perfect.

19:26.396 --> 19:27.598
Love it.

19:31.435 --> 19:33.304
There was
actually a closer spot.

19:34.439 --> 19:36.274
I don't know what's
taking them so long.

19:36.307 --> 19:38.309
I'm sure they're minutes away.

19:40.979 --> 19:41.979
That better be them.

19:43.948 --> 19:46.817
I can't believe they
only had two bags left.

19:46.851 --> 19:48.896
You look like you're
struggling to just hold the one.

19:48.920 --> 19:49.920
I'm kidding.

19:51.455 --> 19:53.524
Here, come on, give it to me.

19:53.557 --> 19:54.593
Let me take it.

19:54.625 --> 19:55.559
You don't have to.

19:55.593 --> 19:56.633
No seriously, I'd like to.

19:57.729 --> 19:59.297
Okay.

19:59.329 --> 19:59.964
Oh, geez.

19:59.998 --> 20:01.933
Yeah, it's heavy.

20:05.670 --> 20:07.973
Thank you for keeping
the ice on your lap.

20:08.006 --> 20:09.416
I just didn't want to
get my stuff all wet.

20:09.440 --> 20:10.883
You know, I've got some
pretty important papers

20:10.907 --> 20:12.576
in there somewhere.

20:12.609 --> 20:13.777
At least my body will be numb

20:13.810 --> 20:15.446
if you get us into an accident.

20:18.650 --> 20:19.650
Oops.

20:23.488 --> 20:24.956
- Hey, cheese!
- Oh, come on.

20:24.989 --> 20:27.459
Come on in you crazy kids.

20:29.661 --> 20:31.596
I thank you.

20:31.628 --> 20:34.465
Yeah, I'm so glad there's
evidence of that thank you.

20:34.499 --> 20:35.634
Annie's cool with this?

20:35.666 --> 20:36.701
It's all the rage.

20:36.733 --> 20:37.868
It's called a beer throw.

20:37.902 --> 20:39.671
Beers in the bathtub, huh?

20:39.703 --> 20:41.472
You always think of something.

20:41.506 --> 20:44.375
Hot appetizers were
off limits this year.

20:44.409 --> 20:45.977
I was afraid to ask.

20:46.009 --> 20:47.009
Hey, Natalie?

20:48.145 --> 20:53.284
Just between us, Annie's not
really saying a lot about it

20:53.317 --> 20:55.353
but she was just laid
off from her job.

20:55.385 --> 20:56.354
What?

20:56.386 --> 20:57.588
Just maybe don't bring it up.

20:57.622 --> 20:59.391
Just try to keep things calm.

20:59.423 --> 21:02.027
I just really need
everything to run smoothly.

21:02.059 --> 21:03.528
Yeah, of course.

21:03.560 --> 21:04.596
Oh my god.

21:04.628 --> 21:05.462
Poor Annie.

21:05.496 --> 21:06.331
She's good.

21:06.364 --> 21:07.432
She's great.

21:07.464 --> 21:10.601
She just hates anything
changing, ever.

21:10.634 --> 21:11.802
That's so Annie.

21:11.836 --> 21:13.313
Do you know that she
had the same haircut

21:13.337 --> 21:15.072
from ages seven to 17?

21:15.105 --> 21:16.040
No.

21:16.074 --> 21:16.975
She would have kept it too.

21:17.009 --> 21:18.777
Except when she was
blowing out the candles

21:18.809 --> 21:21.011
at her 17th birthday party,
her bangs caught on fire.

21:21.045 --> 21:22.781
Don't say, and
don't say fire either.

21:22.814 --> 21:24.449
So I ran out of
my apartment, like,

21:24.481 --> 21:26.017
with a fire extinguisher in hand

21:26.049 --> 21:27.985
and I put out the
fire right as like,

21:28.019 --> 21:29.854
the firefighters were showing up

21:29.886 --> 21:30.930
and I think they were jealous

21:30.954 --> 21:32.523
because they missed the action.

21:32.557 --> 21:35.527
But smoke was like
billowing up in my face.

21:35.559 --> 21:38.863
And Annie, she had put
like flammable material

21:38.895 --> 21:40.898
in the drawer underneath.

21:40.932 --> 21:43.801
Are you gonna tell
everyone about it, cliff?

21:43.835 --> 21:44.803
She's interested.

21:44.836 --> 21:45.937
You're interested, right?

21:45.970 --> 21:48.506
But what's your, I
didn't catch your name.

21:48.538 --> 21:49.473
It's Megan.

21:49.507 --> 21:51.576
Megan is very interested, so.

21:51.608 --> 21:53.811
I was just coming
to put my coat down.

21:53.845 --> 21:55.079
Ah-huh, okay.

21:55.113 --> 21:56.681
So have you ever put out a fire?

21:56.713 --> 21:57.791
Because sometimes you're like,

21:57.815 --> 22:00.118
I burnt my beard a little bit.

22:04.622 --> 22:05.862
Oh yeah, I just got these socks.

22:07.424 --> 22:10.095
I just live right
across the hall.

22:18.935 --> 22:21.972
Oh, you know who
friended me on Facebook?

22:22.006 --> 22:23.041
Naomi hagar.

22:23.907 --> 22:25.910
Whoa, Naomi?

22:26.810 --> 22:29.079
How is she, how's she doing?

22:29.113 --> 22:30.949
From light Internet stalking,

22:30.981 --> 22:32.649
she seems to be doing very well.

22:32.682 --> 22:36.121
Somehow she seems to
moved on from you.

22:36.153 --> 22:38.457
It has been a decade
since we graduated.

22:39.757 --> 22:41.568
Do you remember that
debate trip that we went on

22:41.592 --> 22:43.461
and you ended up
missing your event,

22:43.493 --> 22:44.670
you had to take
her to urgent care?

22:44.694 --> 22:46.039
And she just barfed all
over your front seat.

22:46.063 --> 22:47.899
That smell never went away.

22:47.932 --> 22:50.535
Sorry, to interrupt,
Annie wanted me to tell you

22:50.567 --> 22:51.645
that your guacamole
is running low.

22:51.669 --> 22:53.171
Oh, duty calls.

22:53.203 --> 22:54.203
Excuse me.

22:57.508 --> 22:59.411
That's a nice color on you.

22:59.443 --> 23:00.443
Thanks.

23:01.278 --> 23:03.615
Hey, I didn't mean to act
like I didn't know you earlier.

23:04.749 --> 23:07.050
I just thought it
might be easier?

23:07.084 --> 23:08.019
For who?

23:08.051 --> 23:10.154
For both of us, I guess?

23:10.188 --> 23:12.791
And once I committed to
it, it felt weird to stop.

23:16.126 --> 23:17.528
Apology accepted.

23:18.229 --> 23:19.998
It wasn't an apology per se.

23:20.030 --> 23:21.499
I should just be
quiet sometimes.

23:21.531 --> 23:22.766
I'm working on it.

23:22.799 --> 23:23.799
Cool.

23:26.069 --> 23:26.937
Annie.

23:26.971 --> 23:28.138
Oh, hello.

23:28.172 --> 23:29.483
You cannot put those
on the food table.

23:29.507 --> 23:30.808
I made these special.

23:30.842 --> 23:31.952
You should try them
before they get eaten up.

23:31.976 --> 23:32.811
Oh, that's sweet.

23:32.844 --> 23:33.945
Seriously though.

23:33.978 --> 23:35.613
I don't want the
plebes to eat them all.

23:35.645 --> 23:37.014
I spent a lot of
money on saffron.

23:37.048 --> 23:39.084
These drunkards wouldn't
appreciate them.

23:41.952 --> 23:42.952
Okay.

23:50.994 --> 23:52.196
Ah!

23:52.230 --> 23:54.499
Natalie, come play.

23:54.531 --> 23:55.699
You're gonna catch on quick.

23:55.732 --> 23:57.543
Just grab the controller
and wait for the beep.

23:57.567 --> 24:00.070
When you hear the beep, it's
a race to press the button

24:00.104 --> 24:02.207
and the last person gets buzzed.

24:02.240 --> 24:03.674
Buzzed?

24:09.079 --> 24:10.647
Ow!

24:10.681 --> 24:12.750
That was worse than the
milgram shock experiment.

24:13.817 --> 24:14.995
It's like where
they're being tortured,

24:15.019 --> 24:16.263
but they have a
fear of authority,

24:16.287 --> 24:17.855
so no one speaks
up and says like,

24:17.888 --> 24:20.224
scientist, stop
it, it's too much.

24:20.258 --> 24:21.092
You know.

24:21.125 --> 24:22.794
It's well known.

24:22.826 --> 24:23.661
It is?

24:23.693 --> 24:24.729
I just had finals.

24:36.740 --> 24:38.175
Your boss never appreciated you

24:38.209 --> 24:40.245
and now you get a fresh start.

24:40.278 --> 24:42.680
I'll keep an ear
open for any leads.

24:42.712 --> 24:45.884
Yeah, but anywhere I go, it
will be starting over again.

24:45.916 --> 24:47.151
Store-bought over there.

24:49.153 --> 24:51.130
I, on the other hand, have
been maxing out credit cards

24:51.154 --> 24:53.524
to go on crappy online dates.

24:53.557 --> 24:55.894
At least you don't have
to worry about that.

24:55.926 --> 24:57.761
I'm just a broke spinster.

24:57.795 --> 24:58.696
Oh, stop.

24:58.729 --> 24:59.831
You have plenty of time.

24:59.864 --> 25:00.765
How old are you?

25:00.798 --> 25:02.165
27.

25:02.199 --> 25:04.803
My mother had two kids
by the time she was 27.

25:07.805 --> 25:09.240
On the bright
side, I could be 27

25:09.272 --> 25:11.275
and raising two ingrates.

25:11.308 --> 25:13.877
Well, here's to
figuring it all out,

25:13.911 --> 25:14.911
next year.

25:16.247 --> 25:18.950
I'm so happy you
throw these parties.

25:18.982 --> 25:20.127
Otherwise I wouldn't
have any place

25:20.151 --> 25:21.885
to go during the holidays.

25:21.919 --> 25:23.095
It's the only time Tom and I get

25:23.119 --> 25:25.155
to see our friends
together in one place.

25:27.325 --> 25:28.559
Who's that?

25:29.259 --> 25:30.627
Oh, I don't know.

25:30.661 --> 25:31.941
She must be one
of Tom's friends.

25:37.667 --> 25:39.603
Hey man, so beers in
the bathtub this year?

25:39.636 --> 25:41.205
It's all the rage.

25:42.807 --> 25:43.974
That's cool.

25:44.008 --> 25:46.144
I like a good beer in
the shower sometimes.

25:48.878 --> 25:50.714
I felt it on my
lips and my hands.

25:52.182 --> 25:54.552
You know what's hilarious
is the beer's not even cold.

25:55.251 --> 25:56.788
After all that.

25:56.820 --> 25:59.222
There you are, you
weren't answering my texts.

25:59.256 --> 26:00.992
I must have left
my phone on silent.

26:01.025 --> 26:02.627
A likely story.

26:02.660 --> 26:03.894
Hi, I'm Shannon.

26:03.928 --> 26:05.296
My lady friend.

26:05.328 --> 26:07.073
Yeah, he doesn't want to
give anybody the wrong idea

26:07.097 --> 26:09.267
that we might actually
be getting serious.

26:09.299 --> 26:11.868
Oh, I remember
those days, totally.

26:11.902 --> 26:13.270
Oh please.

26:13.304 --> 26:14.848
You were the one desperate
to lock it down, not me.

26:14.872 --> 26:16.240
I was, it's true.

26:16.272 --> 26:17.207
I don't care.

26:17.240 --> 26:18.400
Well they should be so lucky.

26:20.978 --> 26:23.681
Excuse me, I'm gonna
pop into the restroom.

26:23.713 --> 26:25.082
So how did you two meet?

26:26.116 --> 26:27.351
An app.

26:27.384 --> 26:28.318
We did too!

26:28.352 --> 26:30.221
They're in the bathroom?

26:31.721 --> 26:32.356
Uh...

26:32.390 --> 26:33.691
One minute!

26:33.723 --> 26:35.192
Yeah, I've heard that before.

26:36.292 --> 26:37.928
What are you doing
this new years?

26:37.961 --> 26:39.864
We're doing a party
if you're around.

26:41.398 --> 26:43.233
Well, I don't know,
you just figure it out.

26:43.267 --> 26:44.701
Excuse you.

26:44.734 --> 26:46.837
Sorry, what was your name again?

26:46.871 --> 26:48.172
It's Shannon.

26:48.204 --> 26:49.807
Also, that dress
is amazing on you.

26:49.839 --> 26:51.708
It's a beautiful color.

26:51.741 --> 26:53.110
Thank you.

26:53.144 --> 26:56.079
You're actually not the first
person to say that tonight.

26:56.113 --> 26:57.715
This all makes a
lot of sense now.

26:57.748 --> 26:59.683
This is what you
were trying to avoid.

26:59.717 --> 27:01.286
Looks like it
didn't work, Logan.

27:02.219 --> 27:03.388
No, not at all.

27:03.421 --> 27:04.255
We can start over.

27:04.288 --> 27:05.656
We're just strangers.

27:05.690 --> 27:07.859
Logan and I are just
a bunch of strangers.

27:07.892 --> 27:09.027
But last year, you two...

27:09.059 --> 27:09.993
I think I'm gonna
get another beer.

27:10.027 --> 27:10.995
You want to join me honey?

27:11.028 --> 27:12.096
No, I'm good.

27:17.167 --> 27:18.001
This is awkward.

27:18.035 --> 27:19.336
Didn't have to be.

27:19.369 --> 27:20.813
Don't go placing the
blame on me, you started it.

27:20.837 --> 27:22.240
You're kind of obsessed with me.

27:22.272 --> 27:23.850
I simply acknowledge who
I've made out with before.

27:23.874 --> 27:25.942
Come on, all those times
stocking me around town.

27:25.976 --> 27:27.311
Oh my god, you wish.

27:27.344 --> 27:30.181
Oh my god, why would anyone
put a beer in a bathtub?

27:30.213 --> 27:31.215
It's all the rage.

27:32.182 --> 27:33.182
Hey, cuz.

27:33.951 --> 27:35.220
What is going on over here?

27:41.791 --> 27:43.160
You're Annie, right?

27:43.193 --> 27:44.428
This is your soiree?

27:44.461 --> 27:45.762
It's absolutely lovely.

27:45.796 --> 27:47.065
It's so cozy.

27:47.097 --> 27:48.298
Everything's just right.

27:48.332 --> 27:50.135
Like really, thank
you for having us.

27:51.935 --> 27:52.769
Who is she?

27:52.803 --> 27:53.803
His lady friend.

27:54.838 --> 27:56.073
I see.

27:56.106 --> 27:57.908
Yeah. I didn't mean
to make a scene.

27:57.942 --> 27:59.477
Logan's being kind
of a dick, actually.

27:59.509 --> 28:00.845
I tried to make good.

28:00.877 --> 28:01.987
You tried to cover your tracks.

28:02.011 --> 28:03.815
Oh my god, you
can't let anything go.

28:03.847 --> 28:04.781
You let everything go.

28:04.815 --> 28:06.817
Just stop, both of you, okay?

28:07.518 --> 28:09.453
Why can't we have a nice time?

28:11.955 --> 28:13.957
Can someone please
just pass me a beer.

28:21.365 --> 28:22.365
Thank you.

28:33.477 --> 28:34.477
Thanks for coming.

28:35.846 --> 28:37.848
I don't go home
for the holidays.

28:37.882 --> 28:39.484
This is my Christmas.

28:41.184 --> 28:42.486
You're Jewish.

28:42.519 --> 28:43.519
I know.

28:45.088 --> 28:46.088
Great party, man.

28:50.827 --> 28:51.827
Later.

28:55.566 --> 28:58.469
Well, at least we've got
enough alcohol for new years.

28:58.501 --> 29:00.370
We can take it to
Chris and Megan's.

29:00.403 --> 29:02.807
They're having us over
at their new place.

29:02.839 --> 29:04.407
Did they buy?

29:04.441 --> 29:05.809
Apparently.

29:05.843 --> 29:08.112
I thought it would be
rude to ask the details,

29:08.144 --> 29:10.514
but I looked it up and
I think they overpaid.

29:14.317 --> 29:16.386
Do you wish we had a house?

29:16.420 --> 29:21.259
Sure, of course, but
we're fine where we are.

29:21.291 --> 29:24.228
This place is cozy, according
to Logan's new lady friend.

29:25.461 --> 29:27.198
He really needs to
stop calling her that.

29:29.400 --> 29:31.335
Toilet's running again.

29:31.367 --> 29:32.936
I guess this place is cozy.

29:35.071 --> 29:36.071
Are you happy?

29:38.041 --> 29:39.041
With me?

29:41.311 --> 29:42.311
Are you kidding?

29:43.247 --> 29:44.247
Of course.

29:45.382 --> 29:46.884
You're my best lady friend.

30:06.069 --> 30:07.214
We're not gonna
have enough food.

30:07.238 --> 30:08.405
Hey good looking.

30:08.439 --> 30:09.582
You are changing the subject.

30:09.606 --> 30:11.474
We have 52 people confirmed.

30:11.508 --> 30:13.344
Luckily we know
a bunch of flakes.

30:15.412 --> 30:17.381
Because, pun intended.

30:17.413 --> 30:19.391
Did you really have to
invite all your work friends?

30:19.415 --> 30:20.517
I don't even know them.

30:20.550 --> 30:22.329
Well, this could be a great
way to get to know them.

30:22.353 --> 30:25.022
Does Logan have another
lady friend coming today, too?

30:25.055 --> 30:26.591
I don't know, we
don't really talk

30:26.624 --> 30:27.959
about that kind of thing.

30:27.991 --> 30:28.593
Are the little ones,
should I just get rid

30:28.625 --> 30:29.625
of the little ones?

30:31.127 --> 30:31.962
Honey?

30:31.996 --> 30:33.131
They're great.

30:34.431 --> 30:36.034
Yeah, they're great.

30:37.500 --> 30:39.537
We should have
made more truffles.

30:39.569 --> 30:40.947
There's some
broccoli in the fridge,

30:40.971 --> 30:42.205
you could put the head out.

30:42.239 --> 30:44.342
Nobody's gonna eat
a head of broccoli.

30:44.375 --> 30:45.576
They will if they're desperate.

30:45.608 --> 30:47.944
So you admit that
we don't have enough.

30:47.978 --> 30:49.346
I do not admit that.

30:49.380 --> 30:50.924
I think that no matter
how much food you put out,

30:50.948 --> 30:52.950
Doug's just gonna demolish it.

30:52.982 --> 30:54.184
What are these lights for?

30:54.218 --> 30:55.887
I was thinking it
could be kind of fun

30:55.920 --> 30:57.989
if they were up
around the windows.

30:58.021 --> 30:59.956
Someone wants to
impress his work friends.

30:59.990 --> 31:01.392
No.

31:01.424 --> 31:02.259
Hmm?

31:02.292 --> 31:03.994
Maybe a little.

31:04.028 --> 31:04.961
That's just human.

31:04.994 --> 31:05.962
And they're not my work friends,

31:05.996 --> 31:07.365
they're just my new friends.

31:07.397 --> 31:10.600
They're, they're, they're
just friends of mine.

31:10.634 --> 31:12.103
Well if they know
the guy I know,

31:12.135 --> 31:13.538
then they're already impressed.

31:16.973 --> 31:19.242
There's a position
opening up in the new year.

31:19.276 --> 31:22.313
I'm the choice, but
they are interviewing

31:22.346 --> 31:23.513
outside the company too.

31:23.547 --> 31:25.115
This is the first
I'm hearing of it.

31:25.148 --> 31:27.284
It's not a big deal, really.

31:27.317 --> 31:28.451
How are these tangled

31:28.484 --> 31:30.387
if all they do is sit
in a box all year?

31:30.421 --> 31:32.289
Who do I have to bribe
to get you the job?

31:32.323 --> 31:34.359
I will ply them with eggnog.

31:35.692 --> 31:36.693
Lenora.

31:36.727 --> 31:38.296
She's on the committee.

31:38.328 --> 31:40.463
I just have to prove to
her that I'm responsible.

31:40.497 --> 31:42.667
But cool, hip.

31:42.700 --> 31:45.269
But you'd trust me with
a million dollar account.

31:45.301 --> 31:47.038
You always managed
to start a project

31:47.070 --> 31:49.205
right before people get here.

31:49.239 --> 31:50.684
Well, is it maybe a
bad time to tell you

31:50.708 --> 31:53.477
that I ordered a
karaoke machine?

31:53.509 --> 31:54.509
Kidding.

31:56.145 --> 31:56.980
Oh, there we go.

31:57.013 --> 31:57.948
How'd you do that?

31:57.981 --> 31:58.982
Easy.

31:59.016 --> 31:59.650
Easy?

31:59.682 --> 32:00.584
You're welcome.

32:00.616 --> 32:01.616
Thank you.

32:03.053 --> 32:04.488
Easy.

32:07.724 --> 32:09.126
Cheers!

32:10.259 --> 32:12.430
You're a wonderful host!

32:12.462 --> 32:14.197
Thank you.

32:18.035 --> 32:19.503
Okay, so furniture
stores are going

32:19.536 --> 32:22.073
out of business all the
time, and yet, economically,

32:22.105 --> 32:24.407
I don't understand how
they have everything

32:24.441 --> 32:26.477
for 80% off all the time.

32:26.509 --> 32:29.379
Maybe the actual
price is just 80% under

32:29.413 --> 32:31.182
what they try to sell it for?

32:31.214 --> 32:33.226
It's either the worst
business to be in or the best.

32:33.250 --> 32:34.285
I don't know.

32:34.317 --> 32:35.452
I haven't decided.

32:35.486 --> 32:37.488
Nina, oh my gosh,
those look incredible.

32:37.520 --> 32:38.564
I'll hide these in the kitchen

32:38.588 --> 32:40.057
so you and Tom can try them.

32:40.089 --> 32:41.089
May I?

32:44.127 --> 32:45.996
You can have one.

32:46.029 --> 32:47.397
Is that salted caramel?

32:47.431 --> 32:49.533
And candied Rosemary with
a brown butter finished.

32:49.566 --> 32:53.203
I thought it was grass.

32:54.337 --> 32:55.337
I'll find Tom.

32:58.107 --> 33:01.144
Just because it,
it looks like grass.

33:02.278 --> 33:04.015
And so he leaves the audition,

33:04.048 --> 33:06.750
which is terrible, and on the
way out he grabs a handful

33:06.784 --> 33:10.221
of grapes and he looks at me
and he goes, "arrivederci."

33:11.454 --> 33:12.389
Please tell me you cast him.

33:12.423 --> 33:13.624
The director wanted to!

33:13.656 --> 33:14.591
No!

33:14.625 --> 33:16.359
Tom, I've got a treat for you.

33:16.393 --> 33:18.496
What are these, pray tell?

33:18.528 --> 33:20.096
Lenora, get in there.

33:20.130 --> 33:22.100
Oh my god, orgasmic.

33:23.232 --> 33:25.502
What are you, like
the cookie goddess?

33:25.536 --> 33:27.071
Oh, I love that.

33:27.104 --> 33:28.806
Oh my god, that's so funny.

33:28.838 --> 33:31.107
Nina, this is lenora,
lenora, this is Nina.

33:31.141 --> 33:32.243
These are incredible.

33:32.276 --> 33:34.178
Yeah, they were.

33:39.715 --> 33:41.418
Thank you, Nina.

33:41.451 --> 33:43.421
What is going on there?

33:43.453 --> 33:44.621
What do you mean?

33:44.654 --> 33:45.455
Were we not supposed
to eat the cookies?

33:45.489 --> 33:46.190
No, no, eat the cookies.

33:46.222 --> 33:46.723
Eat the cookies.

33:46.757 --> 33:47.557
They're good.

33:47.590 --> 33:49.592
Yeah, they are.

34:00.170 --> 34:04.709
♪ Shouldn't be alone
for Christmas, baby ♪

34:05.709 --> 34:06.709
Hello, Natalie.

34:07.711 --> 34:10.447
Oh, hello there.

34:11.815 --> 34:13.083
Happy holidays.

34:14.550 --> 34:17.087
I thought you'd be impressed
that I remembered your name.

34:18.588 --> 34:21.858
It's kind of a basic human
expectation that I have

34:21.891 --> 34:24.294
after I've met someone
a number of times.

34:24.327 --> 34:25.604
It's something
I've been working on.

34:25.628 --> 34:28.432
Meeting basic
human expectations?

34:29.532 --> 34:30.532
Well, yeah.

34:32.503 --> 34:34.472
That's very self-aware of you.

34:34.505 --> 34:36.316
Actually I have kind of a
funny story that involves you.

34:36.340 --> 34:37.375
Oh, do you?

34:38.275 --> 34:39.443
Yeah, I.

34:40.577 --> 34:44.181
I'm sorry, you have,
there's just a little.

34:44.213 --> 34:45.181
Hmm?

34:45.215 --> 34:46.851
You, here, I'll just.

34:48.885 --> 34:50.454
Thanks.

34:50.487 --> 34:52.590
Anyway, I guess it's
just a thing of the times

34:52.623 --> 34:56.527
that we live in, but you
actually came up as a match

34:56.559 --> 34:57.828
on my dating profile.

34:59.762 --> 35:00.597
Oh!

35:00.630 --> 35:01.431
I knew it.

35:01.465 --> 35:02.633
I knew it!

35:02.666 --> 35:03.601
You got it too and
you swiped right!

35:03.634 --> 35:05.336
No, no, no, I did not.

35:05.369 --> 35:07.338
I closed the app immediately,

35:07.371 --> 35:08.648
and then when I
restarted you were gone.

35:08.672 --> 35:11.208
I don't think that's
how the app works.

35:11.240 --> 35:11.876
Yeah, it does.

35:11.909 --> 35:13.443
It works like that.

35:13.476 --> 35:15.155
It definitely does because
that's what happened.

35:15.179 --> 35:16.247
And that's what I did.

35:16.280 --> 35:18.115
While we're on the topic,

35:19.449 --> 35:21.751
have you ever considered
a different profile photo?

35:21.784 --> 35:24.454
I'm just saying you're
much prettier in real life,

35:24.487 --> 35:25.855
why start with that picture?

35:25.889 --> 35:28.159
I think you think you're
complimenting me right now...

35:28.192 --> 35:29.626
What was it your profile said?

35:29.659 --> 35:31.327
You want someone who
will challenge you?

35:31.360 --> 35:33.163
Okay, I'm not getting into this.

35:34.431 --> 35:36.166
But why are all the
pictures on your profile

35:36.199 --> 35:37.934
full of remnants of other women?

35:37.967 --> 35:39.769
Like the super
random arm around you

35:39.802 --> 35:40.971
or the cute side boob.

35:41.003 --> 35:44.407
It's like, oh, hey, I have
access to all these hot women.

35:44.440 --> 35:46.209
That is not what I'm saying.

35:46.242 --> 35:48.612
Those are just pictures
that exist of me.

35:48.644 --> 35:49.880
Then crop it.

35:49.913 --> 35:51.624
Just because I don't
take all these selfies,

35:51.648 --> 35:52.650
like a millennial.

35:52.682 --> 35:53.784
You are a millennial.

35:53.817 --> 35:54.928
Yeah, but I don't act like one.

35:54.952 --> 35:57.488
Is Logan bothering you?

35:57.521 --> 35:59.190
Not more so than usual.

35:59.222 --> 36:00.532
Have you bragged
yet about how you only

36:00.556 --> 36:02.525
have a semester left
of your program?

36:02.559 --> 36:03.661
No, mom.

36:03.693 --> 36:04.795
One semester, huh?

36:04.827 --> 36:06.463
I graduate in the spring.

36:06.496 --> 36:08.231
You can finally diagnosed me.

36:08.264 --> 36:10.400
It would be unprofessional
to say sociopath, right?

36:10.434 --> 36:11.802
She gets it.

36:12.969 --> 36:15.371
Tom, what's
your diagnosis for me?

36:15.405 --> 36:18.943
Well, in my very
unprofessional opinion,

36:18.976 --> 36:21.278
I would say, soulmate.

36:21.311 --> 36:22.680
Oh.

36:22.713 --> 36:23.881
Soulmate.

36:23.914 --> 36:25.482
Bullshit.

36:25.514 --> 36:27.483
I may sound cheesy, but
sometimes you just know.

36:27.516 --> 36:29.652
Come on, it's an
outdated notion.

36:29.686 --> 36:33.390
It's gone the way the crank
car, am-fm radio, flip phones.

36:33.422 --> 36:34.700
Yeah, I mean the
presumption that there's

36:34.724 --> 36:36.594
just one person
out there for each

36:36.626 --> 36:37.927
and every one of
us is ludicrous.

36:37.960 --> 36:38.861
Right?

36:38.894 --> 36:40.039
And what about the rest of us?

36:40.063 --> 36:42.303
What are we just losers waiting
to find the one and only?

36:42.331 --> 36:43.266
Yeah, good luck.

36:43.300 --> 36:44.235
Get ready to die alone.

36:44.268 --> 36:46.836
I wonder what the sex
is like for soulmates.

36:46.869 --> 36:48.505
Okay.

36:48.538 --> 36:49.840
Da, da, da, da!

36:49.873 --> 36:52.443
You almost forget to
bring this out this year.

36:52.476 --> 36:53.577
Oh, yeah.

36:53.610 --> 36:54.745
I guess I, I guess I did.

36:54.777 --> 36:56.512
You want to get some air?

36:56.545 --> 36:58.448
Cliff, that was in
our bedroom closet.

36:58.481 --> 36:59.650
Oh, I'm sorry, Annie.

36:59.682 --> 37:01.552
I guess you forgot
to take it out.

37:01.585 --> 37:02.885
Oh, what is this?

37:02.918 --> 37:04.855
This is a stupid game.

37:04.887 --> 37:06.923
If by stupid you mean awesome.

37:06.956 --> 37:08.358
Basically you get electrified

37:08.391 --> 37:09.802
if you don't push the
button fast enough.

37:09.826 --> 37:13.297
It's like musical
chairs with electricity.

37:13.329 --> 37:16.333
All right, this sounds
like a really masochistic

37:16.365 --> 37:18.469
and juvenile form
of entertainment.

37:18.501 --> 37:19.335
Totally.

37:19.369 --> 37:20.471
Obviously I'm in.

37:20.503 --> 37:21.505
What do we do?

37:21.538 --> 37:22.505
Does it hurt?

37:22.539 --> 37:23.741
Does it plug into something?

37:23.773 --> 37:24.574
No, it's already in there.

37:24.608 --> 37:25.776
What's the voltage?

37:25.809 --> 37:27.344
Well, let me,
let me, I'll start.

37:27.376 --> 37:28.521
If you're really curious,
I'll start the game

37:28.545 --> 37:29.889
and then, and then,
and then we can just,

37:29.913 --> 37:32.449
that's all, we'll all,
I'll teach you how to play.

37:33.784 --> 37:36.753
I've actually been off all
the apps for a few months now.

37:38.521 --> 37:40.257
I think I slept with half of la.

37:41.358 --> 37:43.628
I'm joking.

37:44.795 --> 37:47.798
I don't know, it just
wasn't joyful anymore.

37:47.831 --> 37:49.634
It was like, what
am I even doing?

37:51.501 --> 37:53.671
I guess I am ready for
something more serious.

37:55.639 --> 37:57.407
I guess I kind of misjudged you.

38:03.512 --> 38:07.050
Well, aren't you gonna
say something like,

38:07.083 --> 38:09.385
maybe I misjudged you too?

38:09.418 --> 38:10.697
I'm a pretty good
read of people.

38:10.721 --> 38:12.456
Of course that's your response.

38:12.489 --> 38:13.657
- Come on.
- Of course!

38:13.690 --> 38:15.525
The only reason you
said I misjudged you

38:15.559 --> 38:17.394
was so I would say
it back to you.

38:26.902 --> 38:27.737
Mm!

38:27.771 --> 38:28.939
Again?

38:29.840 --> 38:31.008
It's your game!

38:31.041 --> 38:32.943
Wow, I haven't
been shocked once!

38:32.976 --> 38:35.079
Tom, it looks like you're
trying to lose this game.

38:35.112 --> 38:37.548
Well, I'm not,
I'm just, I'm rusty.

38:37.581 --> 38:40.384
I, listen, I don't play
this all that much, really.

38:40.416 --> 38:41.050
What?

38:41.083 --> 38:41.984
Are you kidding me?

38:42.018 --> 38:42.885
This is like the best game ever.

38:42.918 --> 38:43.753
I agree.

38:43.786 --> 38:44.687
Yeah, another round.

38:44.721 --> 38:45.856
Yeah, keep going.

38:45.889 --> 38:47.099
Come one everybody,
one more round!

38:47.123 --> 38:48.424
I'm just getting warmed up!

38:48.458 --> 38:49.126
One more round, one more round!

38:49.159 --> 38:50.827
Really?

38:50.860 --> 38:52.180
One more round,
let's get shocked!

38:53.130 --> 38:54.731
My program ends in the spring

38:54.764 --> 38:56.666
and I have no idea
what I want to do.

38:57.800 --> 38:59.536
You don't want to
do psychology anymore?

38:59.568 --> 39:00.704
No, I do.

39:00.737 --> 39:03.106
I just, I don't
know where or how.

39:03.139 --> 39:04.507
They teach you the academics

39:04.541 --> 39:06.610
but they don't
give you a roadmap.

39:06.643 --> 39:09.646
And I feel like everyone in my
program is setting down roots

39:09.679 --> 39:13.717
and finding their direction,
and no path feels right to me.

39:13.750 --> 39:14.750
I don't know.

39:16.519 --> 39:18.054
I've never known what I wanted.

39:19.188 --> 39:21.625
I joined RotC on a whim

39:21.657 --> 39:24.161
and ended up overseas
after graduation.

39:24.193 --> 39:26.764
I thought I'll be
career military.

39:28.164 --> 39:33.371
Then my tour ended, I came
home, got into tech, here I am.

39:35.838 --> 39:37.375
Life works in funny ways.

39:38.909 --> 39:40.510
How did I not
know this about you?

39:40.543 --> 39:41.720
You were too busy blathering on

39:41.744 --> 39:44.882
about your program.

39:44.914 --> 39:46.384
Rude!

39:47.918 --> 39:49.452
Yeah, again.

39:49.485 --> 39:51.621
You're terrible at this.

39:52.521 --> 39:54.123
Hey, rematch.

39:54.157 --> 39:55.626
I could tap you out.

39:55.659 --> 39:57.594
No, no, no, I got another one.

39:57.626 --> 39:58.895
Stop hogging the game.

39:58.929 --> 39:59.939
Isn't that what
you're doing, Doug?

39:59.963 --> 40:01.731
I am the reigning champion.

40:01.764 --> 40:03.166
Oh, okay.

40:03.199 --> 40:05.239
You know what cliff, maybe
you can, you can jump in.

40:13.175 --> 40:14.878
Yeah!

40:14.911 --> 40:16.512
Holy mother of...

40:16.545 --> 40:17.614
It's bad, isn't it?

40:18.782 --> 40:19.782
Way to go, Tom.

40:22.518 --> 40:24.421
Do you have any
plans for new years?

40:25.155 --> 40:26.723
I got a few options.

40:26.755 --> 40:29.091
Ah, you don't want to commit

40:29.125 --> 40:31.061
because you're fielding offers

40:31.094 --> 40:32.729
and you want to keep
your options open

40:32.762 --> 40:34.865
unless something
better comes up.

40:34.898 --> 40:36.533
I know.

40:36.565 --> 40:38.468
The shrink program
is really working.

40:40.737 --> 40:42.606
I actually hate new years.

40:42.639 --> 40:44.041
I really do, too much pressure.

40:44.074 --> 40:46.943
You know, you rack your brain
to do something special,

40:46.976 --> 40:48.553
when all you really
want to do is sit home

40:48.577 --> 40:50.079
and watch the ball drop.

40:50.112 --> 40:53.683
But instead you go out, you
spend way too much money.

40:53.717 --> 40:56.552
You stand in a room
full of strangers

40:56.585 --> 40:59.522
counting down to a new year
in hopes it will be better

40:59.556 --> 41:01.191
than the one you just had?

41:01.224 --> 41:04.193
You've never had a good new
year's, that's your problem.

41:04.226 --> 41:06.062
I suppose you've had so many?

41:06.096 --> 41:09.233
Tom and I had
some good ones after college.

41:10.766 --> 41:12.144
We were both home for the
holidays and neither one

41:12.168 --> 41:14.972
of us wanted to feel stuck
at our parents' places.

41:15.005 --> 41:20.010
And my mom, I love her, but
she just worries about me.

41:21.878 --> 41:23.247
Always has, always will.

41:24.780 --> 41:26.124
And she didn't want me out
on the road with, you know,

41:26.148 --> 41:27.750
all the crazies on the road.

41:27.784 --> 41:28.994
I don't know if you
know this or not,

41:29.018 --> 41:31.687
but after 2:00 am,
it is crazy central.

41:31.721 --> 41:32.922
So I've heard.

41:32.956 --> 41:37.260
So Tom and I would just camp
out in my parents' basement,

41:37.293 --> 41:40.730
play gin rummy and drink my
grandmother's boxed wine.

41:42.831 --> 41:45.601
If that's the case, why settle

41:45.635 --> 41:48.272
for some lame warehouse party?

41:48.304 --> 41:50.540
Sounds like you already
know what you want.

41:54.311 --> 41:58.182
Excuse me, is
this your residence?

41:59.148 --> 42:00.148
No.

42:01.050 --> 42:02.050
Thank you, ma'am.

42:07.157 --> 42:08.659
Miss would have been fine.

42:09.992 --> 42:12.663
Ugh!

42:12.695 --> 42:14.297
It's really not that bad.

42:14.331 --> 42:16.867
The sting goes away
relatively quickly.

42:16.900 --> 42:19.168
I should know, I lost
about eight times.

42:19.202 --> 42:21.238
Uh, you weren't wearing rings.

42:22.672 --> 42:23.672
I have a ring.

42:26.009 --> 42:28.012
It's open get in here!

42:36.885 --> 42:37.885
It's his place.

42:45.228 --> 42:46.063
Sir?

42:46.096 --> 42:47.630
Is this your apartment?

42:47.664 --> 42:48.298
Yes.

42:48.331 --> 42:49.199
Yes it is.

42:49.231 --> 42:50.601
But we don't own it.

42:50.634 --> 42:53.637
We, we rent, which is
not what you asked.

42:53.670 --> 42:54.838
That's not what I, yeah.

42:56.039 --> 42:57.807
Look, we received
a noise complaint.

42:57.840 --> 42:58.976
Really?

42:59.009 --> 43:00.610
Oh, that's probably
when lenora lost.

43:00.643 --> 43:01.711
She screamed.

43:03.213 --> 43:04.114
Sorry about that.

43:04.146 --> 43:05.648
We were playing a little game.

43:06.682 --> 43:07.682
All right.

43:08.918 --> 43:10.686
I thought this would be kids.

43:10.719 --> 43:14.757
Aren't you a little old
to be throwing ragers?

43:14.791 --> 43:15.826
Myself?

43:15.858 --> 43:16.793
No, I don't think so.

43:16.826 --> 43:18.628
I'm very hip, you have no idea.

43:19.695 --> 43:20.831
You are?

43:20.864 --> 43:23.367
I'm very cool, I'm very relaxed.

43:25.135 --> 43:26.737
All right.

43:26.769 --> 43:28.180
How about you tell me that
you're wrapping things up

43:28.204 --> 43:31.108
and that as you do, you'll
keep things quiet in here.

43:31.141 --> 43:33.744
I promise you that we
were going to wrap it up.

43:33.777 --> 43:34.954
I don't mean literally tell me,

43:34.978 --> 43:36.254
I just mean, like you
get what I'm saying,

43:36.278 --> 43:38.014
like that's what's happening.

43:38.047 --> 43:39.248
Yes, I promise we will.

43:39.282 --> 43:41.218
It's gonna be a house
of mouse, mouses.

43:42.184 --> 43:43.786
It's gonna be quiet.

43:43.820 --> 43:45.322
Okay.

43:45.355 --> 43:47.356
Feels like we've
already started.

43:47.389 --> 43:48.389
Yeah.

43:57.166 --> 44:01.038
Anyway, happy holidays.

44:01.070 --> 44:02.072
Thank you.

44:02.105 --> 44:03.185
You as well, also with you.

44:04.440 --> 44:05.975
All right.

44:06.009 --> 44:07.009
Drive safe.

44:09.244 --> 44:10.244
I'll explain it later.

44:14.317 --> 44:16.152
Is the coast clear?

44:17.820 --> 44:21.057
The last time the cops busted
a party, I was in high school.

44:21.090 --> 44:23.259
My instincts kicked in.

44:23.293 --> 44:25.295
It's like we're back in college.

44:25.327 --> 44:26.829
Cheer up, it's all fine.

44:26.862 --> 44:29.065
How is it I'm the one
who's not freaking out?

44:30.333 --> 44:33.836
Hey man, I was using
your bathroom earlier

44:33.869 --> 44:36.138
and the toilet
just keeps running.

44:36.172 --> 44:38.041
Like I jiggled the
handle and everything

44:38.074 --> 44:39.710
and it just won't stop.

44:39.742 --> 44:41.210
So I think you should fix that.

44:41.244 --> 44:42.179
Okay, thanks cliff.

44:42.211 --> 44:43.045
Because it's just a big waste.

44:43.079 --> 44:44.414
Got it, yep.

44:44.447 --> 44:46.349
We gotta get going.

44:46.382 --> 44:47.583
Oh.

44:47.617 --> 44:49.327
Yeah, we gotta get all the
way back to the West Side, so.

44:49.351 --> 44:50.319
Great party, man.

44:50.353 --> 44:51.722
Thank you, yeah.

44:51.755 --> 44:52.932
Listen it's not
usually like this.

44:52.956 --> 44:54.057
We're very responsible.

44:54.090 --> 44:55.090
See you Monday.

44:56.126 --> 44:56.960
Do you want to grab
a bite or something?

44:56.992 --> 44:58.061
I'm starving.

44:58.094 --> 44:58.929
Yeah.

44:58.961 --> 45:00.130
Let's get out of here.

45:00.163 --> 45:01.683
All right, I'll see
you on Monday then.

45:02.998 --> 45:03.833
It's good.

45:03.867 --> 45:05.168
It's okay.

45:05.201 --> 45:06.235
Starving, she said.

45:07.369 --> 45:09.038
I have some cookies left.

45:09.072 --> 45:10.006
- Doug, not now.
- For what?

45:10.039 --> 45:11.208
- Not now.
- For them.

45:11.240 --> 45:12.240
They're gone.

45:13.842 --> 45:15.186
So it's not really
my style to ask,

45:15.210 --> 45:16.779
but I don't have your number.

45:16.813 --> 45:18.849
Is that a question, exactly?

45:18.882 --> 45:21.117
Fine, can I have your number?

45:21.150 --> 45:23.186
Well, only because
you asked so nicely.

45:25.855 --> 45:27.257
What are you doing?

45:27.289 --> 45:28.824
Getting a pen.

45:28.858 --> 45:30.393
Just put it on
my phone, are you...

45:30.425 --> 45:32.496
No, I'm writing it down.

45:32.528 --> 45:33.831
This is a test, Logan.

45:34.931 --> 45:37.099
Will you put my
number in your phone

45:37.132 --> 45:39.368
or do you lose this
piece of paper?

45:41.103 --> 45:42.438
Okay.

45:42.472 --> 45:43.472
I hope you pass.

45:45.875 --> 45:47.010
You have to grab it too.

45:48.210 --> 45:49.445
Is this is another test?

45:50.980 --> 45:51.980
No.

46:03.193 --> 46:04.528
I got it.

46:04.561 --> 46:05.996
I let you get it.

46:09.199 --> 46:10.166
Walk you to your car?

46:10.199 --> 46:11.199
Yes, please.

46:17.340 --> 46:20.043
It's like we never see
each other at our parties.

46:21.177 --> 46:23.914
Yeah, I guess you're right.

46:23.947 --> 46:25.782
You're always busy playing host.

46:26.916 --> 46:28.084
You are too, you know.

46:28.117 --> 46:30.353
It's not a complaint.

46:30.385 --> 46:34.324
It's just nice to get
some me and you time.

46:35.458 --> 46:37.528
Even if it's after
everyone else's left?

46:38.862 --> 46:40.463
Who leaves their
drink in a plant?

46:45.635 --> 46:48.471
You think we'll have
this party forever?

46:48.503 --> 46:49.503
Yeah, of course.

46:50.440 --> 46:51.907
I don't know.

46:51.940 --> 46:53.376
It's just such a thing.

46:54.443 --> 46:55.454
And I love that it's a thing.

46:55.478 --> 46:56.813
It's our thing.

46:58.280 --> 47:00.183
But do you think
we'll do it forever?

47:01.516 --> 47:04.020
I guess I just kind of
assumed that we would.

47:07.422 --> 47:09.525
Do you feel stuck with me?

47:09.559 --> 47:11.094
Where is this coming from?

47:13.396 --> 47:14.531
Do you feel stuck with me?

47:16.431 --> 47:19.268
I just want to make sure that
we're progressing, you know.

47:19.302 --> 47:21.938
Our life is changing.

47:21.971 --> 47:22.971
It's not stagnant.

47:25.942 --> 47:27.411
I'm happy just the way we are.

47:30.445 --> 47:32.516
Are you the way you are forever?

47:34.284 --> 47:35.853
This is a tradition.

47:37.186 --> 47:39.389
We have thrown this party
at this very apartment

47:39.422 --> 47:41.157
for the last seven years.

47:42.291 --> 47:43.291
It's special.

47:44.527 --> 47:46.528
People look forward to it.

47:46.561 --> 47:47.998
I look forward to it.

47:49.097 --> 47:50.333
I know, I do too.

47:51.467 --> 47:54.103
I just want to make sure
that we're growing together.

47:55.237 --> 47:56.572
I think that's what we're doing.

47:59.541 --> 48:00.621
Yeah, I guess you're right.

48:20.096 --> 48:22.097
Maybe people don't
account for the longer commute.

48:22.130 --> 48:23.199
Only a few minutes after

48:23.231 --> 48:24.534
when we said it would start.

48:24.567 --> 48:25.945
Yeah, but Natalie
always shows up early.

48:25.969 --> 48:27.570
That's when
she was coming alone.

48:27.603 --> 48:28.538
Well, what about cliff?

48:28.570 --> 48:30.139
He's always obnoxiously early.

48:30.172 --> 48:31.106
Well that's when
all he had to do

48:31.139 --> 48:32.342
was come across the hallway.

48:33.376 --> 48:34.444
You're right.

48:34.476 --> 48:35.545
It's fine, it's fine.

48:41.016 --> 48:42.719
What if nobody wants
to drive this far?

48:42.751 --> 48:44.653
Oh honey, put
yourself in their shoes.

48:44.686 --> 48:47.190
You would drive
an extra 3 minutes

48:47.222 --> 48:49.393
to go to your dear
friend's Christmas party.

48:50.726 --> 48:53.462
No, I probably stay in my
pj's and binge-watch garbage TV.

48:54.597 --> 48:55.597
Oh.

48:58.400 --> 49:00.103
Oh, ah, move, scoot, scoot.

49:00.135 --> 49:02.338
Okay, all right, yep, yep.

49:06.476 --> 49:07.644
Oh wow!

49:07.677 --> 49:09.346
Come on in.

49:09.378 --> 49:11.380
No trouble parking this year.

49:11.414 --> 49:13.083
Did you hear that, Annie?

49:13.115 --> 49:14.115
She's real!

49:16.686 --> 49:19.588
Sequels are never as
good as the originals.

49:19.621 --> 49:21.423
They would not make one

49:21.456 --> 49:23.492
if the first one weren't
really, really good.

49:23.525 --> 49:25.561
And just the alchemy
of trying to make two

49:25.594 --> 49:27.129
or more great films is something

49:27.163 --> 49:29.132
that almost no one can achieve.

49:29.164 --> 49:30.500
Empire, dark knight, aliens.

49:30.532 --> 49:31.735
Wow, wow, okay.

49:31.768 --> 49:34.070
First of all, "alien"
was a masterpiece.

49:34.103 --> 49:35.070
But Reiser!

49:35.103 --> 49:36.605
They could both be great.

49:39.641 --> 49:41.543
This is thunderdome.

49:41.577 --> 49:45.749
Two men enter, one
man leaves, Tom.

49:45.782 --> 49:47.617
Doug is such a sore loser.

49:47.650 --> 49:49.686
Our first date, I
beat him at catan.

49:51.219 --> 49:53.455
She handed me my hat.

49:53.489 --> 49:55.133
I thought there might
not be a second date,

49:55.157 --> 49:57.192
the way he was
sulking afterward.

49:57.226 --> 49:58.369
Knowing Doug,
there had to be one

49:58.393 --> 49:59.361
so there could be a rematch.

49:59.394 --> 50:02.331
Which I won, handily.

50:04.266 --> 50:05.467
I'll get it.

50:05.501 --> 50:08.038
There was no such
thing as an untouchable enemy.

50:08.070 --> 50:10.373
Okay, you probably like
the special additions.

50:11.807 --> 50:13.143
We're gonna go there?

50:14.277 --> 50:16.780
And before you say anything
and I have to play dumb,

50:16.813 --> 50:18.381
your mom already
spilled the beans.

50:18.414 --> 50:19.549
Congratulations!

50:19.581 --> 50:20.682
It just happened!

50:20.715 --> 50:21.927
She promised she
wouldn't tell anyone.

50:21.951 --> 50:25.121
I love your mom, but we both
know she can't keep a secret.

50:25.153 --> 50:27.657
She's been planning your
wedding since we were kids.

50:27.690 --> 50:29.325
Your home is beautiful.

50:29.358 --> 50:30.794
Oh, that's very
sweet of you to say.

50:30.827 --> 50:32.696
We're still settling in.

50:33.663 --> 50:35.264
The tree looks good.

50:35.297 --> 50:36.232
This time of year.

50:36.266 --> 50:39.601
Any more than that
would be weird, right?

50:39.635 --> 50:41.838
Adler, come see
Tom in the kitchen.

50:41.871 --> 50:43.106
If Picasso had better paint,

50:43.139 --> 50:44.340
he'd go back and tinker.

50:44.373 --> 50:46.151
No, he would know that
each painting was done.

50:46.175 --> 50:47.811
An artist knows when to stop.

50:47.844 --> 50:49.445
Speaking of
knowing when to stop.

50:49.478 --> 50:51.713
Come on, man, you're on
my side for this, right?

50:51.746 --> 50:52.815
I don't...

50:52.849 --> 50:54.851
Tom, you remember adler.

50:54.884 --> 50:56.052
I'll be back.

50:57.552 --> 50:58.587
I'll be back.

50:59.588 --> 51:02.592
Hey, welcome to the family.

51:02.625 --> 51:04.159
You locked it down quick.

51:04.193 --> 51:05.870
Yeah, couldn't let
someone else snap her up.

51:05.894 --> 51:07.738
I already you let her get
away once in high school.

51:07.762 --> 51:09.298
Unsolicited wedding advice,

51:09.331 --> 51:11.467
do not forget to eat
the hors d'oeuvres.

51:11.501 --> 51:12.644
I didn't get a chance
to have a single one

51:12.668 --> 51:14.137
because we were
busy taking pictures

51:14.170 --> 51:15.305
during the cocktail hour.

51:15.338 --> 51:16.606
And he's still talking about it.

51:16.639 --> 51:17.474
Well you know.

51:17.507 --> 51:18.340
Get over it.

51:18.373 --> 51:19.576
Natalie, come talk.

51:19.608 --> 51:21.510
Do you have a date yet?

51:21.543 --> 51:23.712
It literally happened this week.

51:23.746 --> 51:26.516
Annie, the last few weeks
have been such a whirlwind.

51:26.548 --> 51:28.284
I mean, we must be getting old

51:28.317 --> 51:30.229
because we started talking
about marriage really quick.

51:30.253 --> 51:31.888
You are not old.

51:31.920 --> 51:33.655
Says the woman who's
been married six years.

51:33.688 --> 51:34.757
Seven.

51:34.789 --> 51:37.159
- Hmm.
- Ugh, I'm old.

51:37.193 --> 51:40.263
Oh wow, look at
those little fingers,

51:40.295 --> 51:41.830
and those itty-bitty nails.

51:41.864 --> 51:43.766
Oh, you're a natural with her.

51:43.798 --> 51:45.434
I thought I was a natural too

51:45.467 --> 51:47.469
until I changed my first diaper.

51:47.503 --> 51:49.739
She is adorable, but
she is vindictive.

51:49.771 --> 51:51.673
Are you vindictive?

51:51.706 --> 51:52.909
Yes, okay.

51:52.942 --> 51:54.443
Well that sums that up.

51:54.476 --> 51:56.145
I love your dress.

51:56.179 --> 51:57.380
What do you say?

51:57.413 --> 51:58.248
Say thank you?

51:58.280 --> 51:58.914
Thank you.

51:58.947 --> 52:00.182
You're welcome.

52:00.215 --> 52:02.217
Can you give him a high five?

52:02.251 --> 52:03.219
Wow, thank you!

52:03.251 --> 52:04.420
You're so cute.

52:08.391 --> 52:09.358
Oh, hey man!

52:09.391 --> 52:10.326
Hey, cliff!

52:10.358 --> 52:11.494
What's up?

52:11.527 --> 52:13.862
Oh, classy move
bringing the booze.

52:13.896 --> 52:15.498
I just brought myself.

52:15.530 --> 52:16.530
Okay.

52:20.570 --> 52:21.738
Ow.

52:21.771 --> 52:23.051
Hey, can you open
this up for me?

52:27.210 --> 52:27.844
You look great.

52:27.876 --> 52:28.844
You're so cute!

52:28.878 --> 52:30.580
Happy maiden voyage!

52:30.612 --> 52:31.513
Oh.

52:31.547 --> 52:32.615
Oh no.

52:32.648 --> 52:33.648
I messed that up.

52:36.485 --> 52:37.687
I brought the beer.

52:37.719 --> 52:40.589
Ah, did you get
thirsty on the way in?

52:40.623 --> 52:41.523
Oh, that.

52:41.556 --> 52:42.925
I got cliff-ed on the way in.

52:42.958 --> 52:44.259
Ah, well, when in Rome.

52:44.293 --> 52:46.528
Ah, heisler my favorite.

52:46.561 --> 52:49.364
You've got great taste.

52:49.398 --> 52:51.534
It's your first time
to the new place, yeah?

52:51.567 --> 52:52.936
It is, it is.

52:52.969 --> 52:54.680
Yeah, man, I wish I could
have come over sooner.

52:54.704 --> 52:58.208
I just, I went home
a lot this year, so.

52:59.574 --> 53:00.777
Yeah.

53:00.809 --> 53:02.612
You hanging in there?

53:02.644 --> 53:03.947
Can we just talk about the fact

53:03.980 --> 53:06.481
that Doug is in the other
room taking pictures

53:06.514 --> 53:08.384
with a real live human woman?

53:08.416 --> 53:10.619
Yes, I know, that
is his girlfriend.

53:10.652 --> 53:11.486
What?

53:11.519 --> 53:13.255
It's a clarkmas miracle!

53:13.289 --> 53:15.692
I guess there's hope for
all of us, huh?

53:15.724 --> 53:16.759
Yeah.

53:16.791 --> 53:17.626
Oh, I'm sorry man.

53:17.659 --> 53:19.295
I'm so rude, Logan.

53:19.327 --> 53:20.463
Adler.

53:20.496 --> 53:21.974
How do you know these
troublemakers, huh?

53:21.998 --> 53:22.965
Work buddy?

53:22.998 --> 53:25.434
Adler is Natalie's fiance.

53:25.467 --> 53:26.568
That's right.

53:26.601 --> 53:27.601
Nice to meet you.

53:28.670 --> 53:29.538
Have you gotten used to it yet?

53:29.572 --> 53:31.474
Fiance?

53:31.507 --> 53:33.809
By the time we got used to
it, we were already married.

53:33.842 --> 53:35.344
Yeah, how do you know Tom?

53:38.813 --> 53:41.583
I've known Logan
since junior high.

53:41.617 --> 53:44.254
We were both in the magic club.

53:44.286 --> 53:45.654
He wanted to be penn and teller,

53:45.688 --> 53:47.808
but neither one of us could
agree to be the short one.

53:48.724 --> 53:49.926
Obviously, it's probably me.

53:49.958 --> 53:51.594
That's really funny.

53:51.626 --> 53:53.963
I bet you guys were so
funny in the magic club.

53:55.530 --> 53:56.766
Adler, is it?

53:56.798 --> 53:58.333
Yeah, that's my name.

53:58.367 --> 53:59.302
Huh.

53:59.335 --> 53:59.969
What are you working on?

54:00.001 --> 54:00.902
What do you do, adler?

54:00.936 --> 54:01.537
I'm an attorney actually.

54:01.570 --> 54:02.672
Wow.

54:02.704 --> 54:03.881
Pretty boring most of the time.

54:03.905 --> 54:05.050
What kind of law
do you practice?

54:05.074 --> 54:06.541
That's professional liability

54:06.574 --> 54:07.976
at a mid-level firm downtown.

54:08.010 --> 54:09.446
Mid-level, huh.

54:10.545 --> 54:12.547
Ah, who was it that
said, first thing we do,

54:12.581 --> 54:13.624
let's kill all the lawyers?

54:13.648 --> 54:14.750
Huh?

54:14.784 --> 54:16.352
Shakespeare.

54:16.385 --> 54:17.896
Yeah, people sure do love
to bring up that quote.

54:17.920 --> 54:20.056
So I know it was
Shakespeare that said it.

54:20.088 --> 54:21.767
You don't need to
patronize me, Georgetown.

54:21.791 --> 54:23.760
Oh, actually went to Stanford.

54:28.030 --> 54:30.932
Logan, did you see we got a
photo booth set up this year?

54:30.965 --> 54:33.402
We always come up with some
way to outdo ourselves.

54:34.670 --> 54:36.405
Don't be mad at me.

54:36.438 --> 54:38.740
I didn't want to go
to law school either.

54:38.773 --> 54:39.909
Man, what is your problem?

54:39.942 --> 54:41.777
What are you talking about, man?

54:41.811 --> 54:42.912
Come on.

54:42.945 --> 54:45.414
You want her to take
pictures, let's take pictures!

54:47.717 --> 54:49.485
Dude, I'm fine.

54:49.518 --> 54:50.653
You don't seem...

54:50.686 --> 54:52.488
This would be the photo booth.

54:52.521 --> 54:54.724
What do you think,
this my color?

54:54.757 --> 54:55.657
Is everything okay?

54:55.690 --> 54:56.958
Yeah, I'm great, man.

54:56.992 --> 54:58.928
We haven't talked in a
while, which is fine,

54:58.960 --> 55:00.896
but I got a promotion
in the fall.

55:00.929 --> 55:01.797
That's great.

55:01.831 --> 55:03.365
I'm a director now.

55:03.398 --> 55:05.467
Director of technical marketing.

55:05.501 --> 55:06.544
That's a great title, right?

55:06.568 --> 55:07.503
- Yeah.
- It's great.

55:07.536 --> 55:08.371
I'm great.

55:08.403 --> 55:10.106
Life is great.

55:10.139 --> 55:11.407
Great.

55:12.507 --> 55:13.675
Exactly.

55:13.708 --> 55:15.644
Aw buddy, looks
like you're the one

55:15.677 --> 55:16.687
that needs to lighten up, huh?

55:16.711 --> 55:17.780
- Here's a boa.
- Okay.

55:20.449 --> 55:21.449
Hey listen.

55:28.123 --> 55:30.459
We do not need to take
a picture right now.

55:30.492 --> 55:32.527
We need to get one for your mom.

55:32.561 --> 55:34.039
Come on, she doesn't
have enough pictures.

55:34.063 --> 55:37.434
He is funny, isn't he?

55:40.668 --> 55:41.668
Hi Logan.

55:42.605 --> 55:44.541
I hear congratulations
are in order.

55:46.141 --> 55:47.609
Yes, they are.

55:49.512 --> 55:50.646
Did you just get here?

55:50.679 --> 55:52.057
Thought you would have
ghosted the party.

55:52.081 --> 55:53.682
Nah, I was just chatting it up

55:53.715 --> 55:55.617
with good adler
here in the kitchen.

55:57.753 --> 55:59.889
So, we have a wedding date yet?

55:59.922 --> 56:00.889
Huh?

56:00.922 --> 56:02.491
Am I on the list?

56:02.525 --> 56:03.668
No, we're going to tour
venues over the holidays

56:03.692 --> 56:05.027
and then we're
gonna pick a date.

56:05.059 --> 56:06.872
Well, I call dibs on
going to the cake tasting.

56:06.896 --> 56:08.097
That'll be awhile.

56:08.130 --> 56:10.133
Oh, speaking of tastings.

56:10.166 --> 56:12.635
Nina's invitation-only
cookies have arrived.

56:12.668 --> 56:14.570
If you'll excuse me.

56:14.603 --> 56:16.038
Oh my gosh, Nina!

56:16.070 --> 56:18.875
So, adler.

56:18.907 --> 56:21.911
Adler, you know what they say?

56:21.943 --> 56:23.947
Never trust a guy
with two last names.

56:25.047 --> 56:26.715
I think it's two
first names actually.

56:26.748 --> 56:27.884
Is that right?

56:27.916 --> 56:28.985
Mm-hm.

56:29.018 --> 56:30.920
Huh, what do you think, adley?

56:30.952 --> 56:31.952
Addie?

56:32.822 --> 56:34.190
You know what I think,

56:34.222 --> 56:35.800
I think I'm gonna go get
some of that famous eggnog

56:35.824 --> 56:37.001
that everyone
keeps talking about

56:37.025 --> 56:39.027
and leave you two to catch up.

56:39.061 --> 56:41.664
But hey, really nice
talking to you, man.

56:41.697 --> 56:43.865
Thanks, man.

56:43.898 --> 56:45.467
- Hey, speaking of eggnog.
- Yeah?

56:45.501 --> 56:47.579
Why don't you grab me a glass
while you're in there, huh?

56:47.603 --> 56:48.605
I would love to.

56:51.039 --> 56:52.942
You ghosted me, not
the other way around.

56:52.974 --> 56:55.076
Oh my god, that was months ago.

56:55.110 --> 56:56.913
Yeah, exactly, like
eight months ago.

56:56.945 --> 56:58.088
But then again, who's counting?

56:58.112 --> 56:59.714
Then you go and
rush into something

56:59.748 --> 57:00.892
and now you're
taking it out on me?

57:00.916 --> 57:02.718
I am not rushing into anything.

57:02.751 --> 57:04.220
I've known adler
since high school.

57:04.253 --> 57:06.521
You can't call that rushing it.

57:06.554 --> 57:08.156
You can, when you're engaged.

57:08.190 --> 57:10.226
If you're so worried
I'm off the market

57:10.259 --> 57:13.161
then you shouldn't have
completely disappeared on me.

57:13.195 --> 57:14.697
I really liked you.

57:15.831 --> 57:17.666
And I don't know
why, but I thought

57:17.699 --> 57:19.234
that something real was there.

57:19.268 --> 57:21.637
And I know things were
moving really fast

57:21.670 --> 57:22.572
and that probably scared you...

57:22.605 --> 57:24.005
I don't need your analysis.

57:24.039 --> 57:26.576
But then you totally
dropped off the planet.

57:26.608 --> 57:28.944
You should have at
least called me.

57:28.978 --> 57:31.246
You messed it up like you do.

57:31.280 --> 57:33.850
And now you see me happy
and you have to ruin it?

57:35.184 --> 57:36.894
I'm actually surprised you
even showed up tonight.

57:36.918 --> 57:38.520
I thought you'd be
too much of a coward.

57:38.554 --> 57:42.625
What if something
happened to me?

57:42.657 --> 57:44.793
What if there's an explanation?

57:50.733 --> 57:51.733
Is there?

57:59.742 --> 58:00.810
I'm going back inside.

58:01.976 --> 58:03.078
You're just angry right now

58:03.112 --> 58:04.713
because you know you're
making a mistake.

58:04.746 --> 58:05.981
I'm just the messenger.

58:06.014 --> 58:06.848
Screw you.

58:06.882 --> 58:08.717
You wish.

58:08.751 --> 58:09.886
You are such a child.

58:17.760 --> 58:20.897
♪ On the first day of Christmas
my true love gave to me ♪

58:20.929 --> 58:24.165

partridge in a pear tree. ♪

58:33.775 --> 58:36.945

58:47.322 --> 58:49.791
So you going home for
the holidays this year?

58:53.596 --> 58:54.596
Yeah.

58:56.097 --> 58:57.866
You don't sound so
thrilled about it.

58:59.134 --> 59:00.134
Yeah, well,

59:03.072 --> 59:05.208
this will be my first
Christmas without my mom, so,

59:06.708 --> 59:09.211
I gotta be there to take
care of my dad and my sister.

59:11.347 --> 59:12.782
It's just gonna be weird.

59:14.817 --> 59:16.853
I'm, I'm really sorry.

59:18.887 --> 59:19.887
It is what it is.

59:21.389 --> 59:23.692
Everybody's got to
lose a parent sometime.

59:32.867 --> 59:34.636
I don't usually do this, but,

59:37.905 --> 59:38.905
take another.

59:42.777 --> 59:43.777
Please.

59:52.086 --> 59:53.722
Mm, is that sage?

59:55.724 --> 59:56.724
And cardamom.

59:59.661 --> 1:00:00.661
That's really good.

1:00:01.697 --> 1:00:02.697
Thank you.

1:00:07.135 --> 1:00:08.371
We should just go, you know?

1:00:08.403 --> 1:00:09.704
I don't...

1:00:09.737 --> 1:00:11.039
Okay, we can go if you want,

1:00:11.072 --> 1:00:13.208
but don't let that guy
make you leave a party

1:00:13.242 --> 1:00:14.343
that you want to stay at.

1:00:14.376 --> 1:00:16.245
I don't really
want to stay anymore.

1:00:16.277 --> 1:00:17.679
Okay.

1:00:17.713 --> 1:00:18.414
There you guys are.

1:00:18.447 --> 1:00:19.981
We're gonna do a group photo.

1:00:20.014 --> 1:00:22.094
That way Tom and I will know
we're at the same party.

1:00:22.251 --> 1:00:23.085
You good?

1:00:23.117 --> 1:00:24.152
Yeah, I'm fine.

1:00:24.186 --> 1:00:25.388
You coming?

1:00:25.420 --> 1:00:26.420
Yeah.

1:00:27.289 --> 1:00:30.893
I found them, okay,
everybody get in here.

1:00:30.925 --> 1:00:33.362
We have props, not optional.

1:00:33.394 --> 1:00:34.896
- Let's get them out.
- My idea.

1:00:34.929 --> 1:00:35.864
It was my idea.

1:00:35.898 --> 1:00:37.099
Yeah, yeah, Tom's idea.

1:00:37.132 --> 1:00:39.969
Oh, mistletoe for the lovers.

1:00:40.001 --> 1:00:41.903
- Nina, this is you.
- Yeah.

1:00:41.936 --> 1:00:44.106
- Obviously.
- Gingerbread!

1:00:45.407 --> 1:00:48.177
Okay, and, you ready?

1:00:49.311 --> 1:00:51.881
One, two, three.

1:00:51.914 --> 1:00:53.249
Clarkmas!

1:00:55.217 --> 1:00:57.153
- All right.
- Awesome.

1:00:57.186 --> 1:00:58.396
Hope I didn't blink in that one.

1:00:58.420 --> 1:00:59.463
It was so great
to see you again.

1:00:59.487 --> 1:01:00.422
Yes, take care.

1:01:00.456 --> 1:01:01.390
We will see you next clarkmas.

1:01:01.422 --> 1:01:03.024
Next clarkmas, it's a date.

1:01:03.057 --> 1:01:04.994
Your gingerbread, woo!

1:01:05.027 --> 1:01:06.429
I can't wait for next year.

1:01:09.164 --> 1:01:11.100
Yeah, there's still food.

1:01:11.132 --> 1:01:12.333
Oh.

1:01:12.367 --> 1:01:14.137
- Oh yeah, help yourself.
- Feel free.

1:01:15.471 --> 1:01:16.706
- Okay.
- Okay.

1:01:16.739 --> 1:01:18.141
All right, okay.

1:01:19.007 --> 1:01:20.007
We did it.

1:01:34.222 --> 1:01:35.724
Shouldn't have bothered.

1:01:35.757 --> 1:01:37.960
I'll put it all up,
I don't need any help.

1:01:37.992 --> 1:01:38.992
You're dead weight.

1:01:40.161 --> 1:01:42.797
Clarkmas isn't
happening this year.

1:01:42.831 --> 1:01:44.467
You're being dramatic.

1:01:44.500 --> 1:01:46.034
I am never dramatic.

1:01:47.335 --> 1:01:48.904
We could still have a party.

1:01:50.072 --> 1:01:51.106
This year sucks.

1:01:52.206 --> 1:01:53.241
We're having a baby.

1:01:54.842 --> 1:01:57.879
I have been barfing for the
last eight months straight.

1:01:57.913 --> 1:01:59.090
There were a couple
of weeks in there

1:01:59.114 --> 1:02:00.849
where you didn't
barf quite as much.

1:02:00.882 --> 1:02:03.185
All my pants feel
like I'm wearing spanx.

1:02:07.021 --> 1:02:08.790
You think I'll be a good dad?

1:02:08.824 --> 1:02:10.026
You'll be the best dad.

1:02:11.260 --> 1:02:12.962
I'm being serious.

1:02:12.994 --> 1:02:15.931
I am serious, you'll be
the best dad there ever was.

1:02:15.963 --> 1:02:18.467
But you can't tell either
of our fathers I said that.

1:02:21.369 --> 1:02:23.172
I'm gonna be the good cop.

1:02:23.204 --> 1:02:24.507
That makes me the bad cop.

1:02:24.539 --> 1:02:26.407
Well, either that or
we're both good cops

1:02:26.440 --> 1:02:27.942
and we raise a criminal.

1:02:27.976 --> 1:02:30.211
Well, that might happen anyway.

1:02:33.148 --> 1:02:35.351
If we don't make noise,
maybe they'll go away.

1:02:35.384 --> 1:02:36.519
You're being ridiculous.

1:02:36.552 --> 1:02:38.128
It's probably a boppy
or some other thing

1:02:38.152 --> 1:02:39.755
your mom insisted on ordering.

1:02:44.458 --> 1:02:45.927
Impromptu clarkmas?

1:02:47.295 --> 1:02:49.564
I knew if I called, Annie
would say not to come over.

1:02:49.597 --> 1:02:50.597
You're right!

1:02:52.067 --> 1:02:54.170
But it's too late now,
so you have to let me in.

1:02:54.202 --> 1:02:55.938
Is that true?

1:02:55.971 --> 1:02:57.072
Yes, come in.

1:03:01.476 --> 1:03:03.012
I come bearing gifts.

1:03:03.045 --> 1:03:04.555
Well, unless your
gift is a flat stomach

1:03:04.579 --> 1:03:06.981
and a painless delivery,
I'm not interested.

1:03:07.014 --> 1:03:08.416
She's been like this all month.

1:03:08.449 --> 1:03:10.552
Don't mansplain your wife.

1:03:10.585 --> 1:03:12.387
That's not mansplaining.

1:03:12.420 --> 1:03:13.989
Oh, I'm sorry,

1:03:14.021 --> 1:03:16.125
would you like to explain
to me what mansplaining is?

1:03:16.157 --> 1:03:18.326
Actually, I think Tom is right.

1:03:18.360 --> 1:03:20.930
He was simply complaining.

1:03:20.963 --> 1:03:23.432
You're embarking on a
brand new adventure.

1:03:23.465 --> 1:03:25.201
The next chapter.

1:03:25.233 --> 1:03:26.902
She's not the only one.

1:03:26.934 --> 1:03:28.403
Oh right, excuse me, Tom.

1:03:28.436 --> 1:03:29.538
You too.

1:03:29.570 --> 1:03:30.739
But you too, nat.

1:03:30.771 --> 1:03:33.842
If the timing's right, this
could be baby's first wedding.

1:03:34.976 --> 1:03:36.110
About that.

1:03:36.143 --> 1:03:37.346
Oh god, what?

1:03:37.378 --> 1:03:39.214
Oh, don't say it like that.

1:03:40.548 --> 1:03:42.351
Well, what were you gonna say?

1:03:46.320 --> 1:03:47.589
Adler and I are calling it off.

1:03:47.623 --> 1:03:48.858
What?

1:03:48.891 --> 1:03:50.059
Oh my gosh, are you okay?

1:03:50.092 --> 1:03:51.994
No, no, it's fine.

1:03:52.027 --> 1:03:54.929
It's, yeah, I'm fine.

1:03:54.963 --> 1:03:59.101
It's ah, yeah, we're both fine.

1:04:00.235 --> 1:04:01.003
How'd it happen?

1:04:01.036 --> 1:04:02.036
Tom!

1:04:03.438 --> 1:04:05.140
How did it happen?

1:04:05.172 --> 1:04:10.178
Well, it was very
mature, actually.

1:04:10.646 --> 1:04:12.214
Extremely.

1:04:12.246 --> 1:04:14.582
We had just had dinner at
his dad and step-mom's house

1:04:14.615 --> 1:04:15.516
for Thanksgiving.

1:04:15.550 --> 1:04:17.052
And that went great, by the way.

1:04:17.085 --> 1:04:18.987
They are very lovely people.

1:04:20.121 --> 1:04:23.291
But we were, you know,
done with dinner,

1:04:23.324 --> 1:04:25.660
on the way to the
airport, and we were stuck

1:04:25.693 --> 1:04:28.130
in this crappy
rental car, you know,

1:04:28.163 --> 1:04:31.333
crawling our way towards O'Hare.

1:04:31.365 --> 1:04:34.936
And I picked this
moment for some reason,

1:04:34.969 --> 1:04:38.072
in horrible traffic,
to turn to him and say,

1:04:38.106 --> 1:04:41.310
this is never gonna
work, you know?

1:04:42.443 --> 1:04:45.648
He was so weird and
quiet after I said it.

1:04:45.681 --> 1:04:47.081
Maybe because of the shock

1:04:47.114 --> 1:04:49.184
or maybe because
he agreed with me.

1:04:50.552 --> 1:04:55.157
So I just rambled on about how
we were really great friends,

1:04:56.057 --> 1:04:58.193
but that we were never in love.

1:04:59.360 --> 1:05:04.232
And we really enjoyed
each other's company,

1:05:04.266 --> 1:05:07.503
but it wasn't
electric or something.

1:05:14.041 --> 1:05:17.679
And of course an
accident is ahead.

1:05:17.713 --> 1:05:22.351
So we are stuck in this
bumper to bumper traffic,

1:05:22.384 --> 1:05:26.389
followed by an
airplane ride to la.

1:05:29.224 --> 1:05:32.227
Definitely should have
waited till after you landed.

1:05:32.260 --> 1:05:35.064
And then we, we
talked about, you know,

1:05:37.331 --> 1:05:39.500
what to do, you know,
how to figure it all out.

1:05:39.534 --> 1:05:44.206
But funny thing is we're
supposed to fly back

1:05:44.239 --> 1:05:47.608
for Christmas Eve with
my parents and his mom

1:05:47.641 --> 1:05:49.277
and his two brothers.

1:05:49.311 --> 1:05:50.679
And we haven't told them yet.

1:05:50.711 --> 1:05:53.181
Nobody knows, and we're
supposed to fly tomorrow.

1:05:53.215 --> 1:05:57.318
And I just feel like my mom is
gonna be really upset.

1:05:57.351 --> 1:05:59.020
Now I have all of this
tacky wedding shit

1:05:59.054 --> 1:06:00.456
that I really don't need.

1:06:00.489 --> 1:06:01.389
Oh honey.

1:06:01.422 --> 1:06:02.590
That's what e-bay is for.

1:06:02.623 --> 1:06:05.026
Not for monogram napkins.

1:06:05.059 --> 1:06:06.195
No, yeah.

1:06:06.228 --> 1:06:07.628
That's gonna be
tough to get rid of.

1:06:11.233 --> 1:06:12.234
It's okay.

1:06:18.672 --> 1:06:20.108
Oh, all right.

1:06:20.141 --> 1:06:22.377
I found the last
box of decorations.

1:06:23.344 --> 1:06:25.680
Who wants to help me decorate?

1:06:25.713 --> 1:06:27.482
Is this gonna hold this up?

1:06:27.516 --> 1:06:28.516
Oh yeah.

1:06:29.318 --> 1:06:31.754
This mantle was born
to house some acorns.

1:06:33.121 --> 1:06:35.057
Those are pine cones, Tom.

1:06:35.090 --> 1:06:35.724
Huh?

1:06:35.757 --> 1:06:36.757
Pine cones.

1:06:37.726 --> 1:06:39.260
You need to center it first.

1:06:39.293 --> 1:06:41.362
Don't pull the tape
until you have a centered

1:06:41.396 --> 1:06:42.364
and know where you want it.

1:06:42.396 --> 1:06:43.231
Okay, tape's ready to go.

1:06:43.264 --> 1:06:44.766
One step, two step.

1:06:44.800 --> 1:06:47.336
A little high, Natalie, a
little lower on your side.

1:06:47.369 --> 1:06:48.269
That's what I was thinking.

1:06:48.302 --> 1:06:49.070
Where are you gonna tape it?

1:06:49.103 --> 1:06:50.038
I don't know.

1:06:50.072 --> 1:06:51.340
Wherever you tell us.

1:06:51.373 --> 1:06:52.374
That's good.

1:06:52.407 --> 1:06:53.375
That's good.

1:06:53.407 --> 1:06:54.242
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1:06:54.275 --> 1:06:55.275
Great.

1:06:59.581 --> 1:07:02.117
Tom, it's not here.

1:07:02.150 --> 1:07:03.586
Did you finish the last of it?

1:07:05.286 --> 1:07:06.788
Guilty.

1:07:06.822 --> 1:07:07.756
Are you serious?

1:07:07.789 --> 1:07:09.625
It's hot chocolate season.

1:07:09.657 --> 1:07:10.525
I'll go get some.

1:07:10.559 --> 1:07:12.661
No, you don't have to.

1:07:12.693 --> 1:07:13.862
Are you kidding me?

1:07:13.894 --> 1:07:17.365
I'm gonna go down to that store
and I'm gonna track it down.

1:07:17.398 --> 1:07:19.134
I'm gonna find your
most very favorite brand

1:07:19.166 --> 1:07:23.172
and we are having hot chocolate
whether you like it or not.

1:07:23.204 --> 1:07:24.306
Thank you.

1:07:24.338 --> 1:07:25.458
I think you're gonna like it.

1:07:27.775 --> 1:07:29.210
Tom's lucky to have you.

1:07:30.311 --> 1:07:32.147
Yeah, I'm pretty
lucky to have him too.

1:07:34.382 --> 1:07:36.318
Just crazy to think how
it's all gonna change

1:07:36.351 --> 1:07:38.186
in a matter of weeks.

1:07:38.219 --> 1:07:39.221
Or less.

1:07:39.253 --> 1:07:40.422
Could be early.

1:07:40.454 --> 1:07:42.391
Please don't say that.

1:07:42.423 --> 1:07:44.460
Seriously though, I
mean, people always assume

1:07:44.492 --> 1:07:47.161
that the first is late,
but my college roommate,

1:07:47.195 --> 1:07:48.564
she had her baby
three weeks early.

1:07:48.597 --> 1:07:50.599
Well, I'd rather
not think about that.

1:07:52.601 --> 1:07:54.836
But I do think that you
should pack a to-go bag

1:07:54.869 --> 1:07:56.180
or something, or
whatever they call it.

1:07:56.204 --> 1:07:57.840
Can you just stop?

1:07:57.873 --> 1:07:59.450
It's like the second
one you get pregnant,

1:07:59.474 --> 1:08:01.610
that's all people want
to talk to you about.

1:08:06.882 --> 1:08:09.085
Adler's a stupid
name, by the way.

1:08:11.353 --> 1:08:12.688
It is.

1:08:13.722 --> 1:08:14.865
- It is.
- Total deal breaker.

1:08:14.889 --> 1:08:16.591
You really dodged
bullet on that one.

1:08:16.625 --> 1:08:17.792
Thank you.

1:08:17.826 --> 1:08:20.895
Yeah, if only that
was the only flaw.

1:08:20.929 --> 1:08:22.631
He was so boring.

1:08:24.698 --> 1:08:26.234
Like milk toast.

1:08:26.268 --> 1:08:29.171
Like I Ken doll, but
with less personality.

1:08:33.375 --> 1:08:34.510
What was I thinking?

1:08:38.180 --> 1:08:39.481
Ah, you want some more music?

1:08:39.514 --> 1:08:40.349
Would that be nice?

1:08:40.381 --> 1:08:41.483
Yeah, sure.

1:08:45.854 --> 1:08:47.422
What you putting on?

1:08:47.454 --> 1:08:49.125
Oh, wouldn't you like to know?

1:08:54.395 --> 1:08:55.395
Okay, all right.

1:08:59.400 --> 1:09:01.603
Go Annie, go Annie.

1:09:03.671 --> 1:09:05.439
Don't laugh at me!

1:09:05.472 --> 1:09:06.774
I'm liking it.

1:09:08.310 --> 1:09:11.180
I don't know, this is my
idea of a party these days.

1:09:11.212 --> 1:09:12.280
I guess so.

1:09:13.480 --> 1:09:15.283
You sad you didn't
have your party?

1:09:16.650 --> 1:09:18.287
Yeah, sure.

1:09:18.319 --> 1:09:20.322
But you know, we didn't
know how I'd be feeling

1:09:20.354 --> 1:09:21.789
or if the baby would come early.

1:09:21.823 --> 1:09:23.759
So it didn't make
sense this year.

1:09:23.792 --> 1:09:25.161
It was the right choice.

1:09:26.293 --> 1:09:27.729
You can still be bummed though.

1:09:28.863 --> 1:09:30.798
The party's never
gonna be the same.

1:09:30.832 --> 1:09:33.402
Our lives aren't
gonna be the same.

1:09:33.435 --> 1:09:34.435
That is true.

1:09:35.703 --> 1:09:36.637
Don't say that.

1:09:36.671 --> 1:09:37.940
Well, it is true though.

1:09:37.972 --> 1:09:40.341
I mean, you're
starting a new chapter.

1:09:40.375 --> 1:09:41.409
You should be excited.

1:09:41.443 --> 1:09:42.677
But if I had known last year

1:09:42.711 --> 1:09:45.213
was gonna be the last
year we had the party.

1:09:45.247 --> 1:09:47.390
Annie, I think you're being
a little dramatic right now.

1:09:47.414 --> 1:09:48.550
You don't get it.

1:09:48.582 --> 1:09:50.351
You still have your
life ahead of you.

1:09:50.385 --> 1:09:51.696
But with every
choice that I make,

1:09:51.720 --> 1:09:53.531
it's like I'm saying
goodbye to the life I have.

1:09:53.555 --> 1:09:54.957
And I really like my life.

1:09:54.989 --> 1:09:56.958
Well then why don't you
be a little more like me,

1:09:56.992 --> 1:09:59.261
and avoid every choice
that you could make?

1:09:59.293 --> 1:10:00.229
I didn't mean...

1:10:00.261 --> 1:10:01.906
You have it all, and
here you are complaining

1:10:01.930 --> 1:10:04.298
about checking off your
next life achievement?

1:10:04.332 --> 1:10:05.375
That's not what I was saying.

1:10:05.399 --> 1:10:06.367
Then what are you saying?

1:10:06.400 --> 1:10:08.502
That you have a perfect
life and a perfect baby?

1:10:08.536 --> 1:10:09.904
Poor you.

1:10:09.938 --> 1:10:11.915
It's just really hard when
you see everyone around you

1:10:11.939 --> 1:10:13.875
doing all the things
that you want to do,

1:10:13.908 --> 1:10:16.578
and you realize it might not
ever be in the cards for you.

1:10:16.610 --> 1:10:18.012
Natalie?

1:10:18.046 --> 1:10:18.847
That's why I said yes to
adler in the first place,

1:10:18.880 --> 1:10:20.349
you know?

1:10:20.381 --> 1:10:21.392
To go down the path
and join the club.

1:10:21.416 --> 1:10:22.583
Natalie?

1:10:22.617 --> 1:10:23.995
There's no point in
going down the path

1:10:24.019 --> 1:10:26.179
just because you're afraid
you have an expiration date.

1:10:29.423 --> 1:10:30.725
Annie?

1:10:30.759 --> 1:10:31.659
Annie!

1:10:31.694 --> 1:10:33.004
I'm pretty sure that
was a contraction.

1:10:33.028 --> 1:10:34.329
What?

1:10:34.362 --> 1:10:35.872
I am pretty sure
that was a contraction.

1:10:35.896 --> 1:10:37.265
What do I do?

1:10:37.298 --> 1:10:37.932
You need to, you
need to time it.

1:10:37.966 --> 1:10:38.600
You need to get a timer.

1:10:38.632 --> 1:10:39.934
Okay.

1:10:39.967 --> 1:10:40.801
It's timing, it's timing.

1:10:40.835 --> 1:10:42.704
It was an impulse buy!

1:10:46.841 --> 1:10:48.043
Oh!

1:10:48.076 --> 1:10:50.746
Yeah, the last one was
about 10 minutes ago.

1:10:50.779 --> 1:10:52.414
Okay.

1:10:52.447 --> 1:10:53.882
Yeah, she's drinking
water already.

1:10:53.914 --> 1:10:55.516
So that's great.

1:10:55.550 --> 1:10:57.820
Now do I need to call before
we leave or can I just go?

1:10:58.819 --> 1:11:00.021
Okay.

1:11:00.055 --> 1:11:02.423
And do I personally need
to bring extra clothes?

1:11:02.457 --> 1:11:03.425
Of course not, okay.

1:11:03.457 --> 1:11:04.659
Oh, okay, thank you.

1:11:05.659 --> 1:11:06.494
Okay, what?

1:11:06.528 --> 1:11:07.396
So do we go now?

1:11:07.429 --> 1:11:08.596
We need to wait.

1:11:08.630 --> 1:11:09.906
They need to be less
than 10 minutes apart

1:11:09.930 --> 1:11:10.798
for an hour straight.

1:11:10.832 --> 1:11:12.768
An hour straight?

1:11:12.801 --> 1:11:14.436
Oh my god.

1:11:18.907 --> 1:11:20.676
I'm going to take a bath.

1:11:20.708 --> 1:11:21.542
Great idea.

1:11:21.576 --> 1:11:22.511
Do you need me?

1:11:22.543 --> 1:11:23.679
You've already done enough.

1:11:26.814 --> 1:11:27.915
Never have children.

1:11:29.650 --> 1:11:30.650
Right.

1:11:38.426 --> 1:11:39.895
Who's ready for hot chocolate?

1:11:49.871 --> 1:11:52.007
Do you need to talk
about the adler stuff?

1:11:52.039 --> 1:11:53.074
No.

1:11:53.108 --> 1:11:54.777
Annie exhausted that topic.

1:11:56.144 --> 1:11:58.780
Because if you wanted to
talk about it, I'm here.

1:12:09.490 --> 1:12:10.859
Is Annie okay?

1:12:10.891 --> 1:12:13.595
Aside from the human trying
to claw its way out of her?

1:12:14.863 --> 1:12:15.864
You know what I mean.

1:12:18.032 --> 1:12:20.536
She doesn't like the
thing she can't control.

1:12:24.572 --> 1:12:27.775
I ordered myself a
Nintendo switch last night.

1:12:27.809 --> 1:12:28.809
Oh.

1:12:29.877 --> 1:12:32.012
I'm supposed to be an adult now,

1:12:32.046 --> 1:12:37.052
but it feels like the closer
we get, the more I revert.

1:12:40.988 --> 1:12:43.424
You don't have to say anything.

1:12:43.457 --> 1:12:45.027
I think I just needed
to tell somebody.

1:12:48.029 --> 1:12:50.966
I peeked into the nursery
on my way to the bathroom.

1:12:52.634 --> 1:12:54.002
It's perfect.

1:12:54.034 --> 1:12:55.470
You think so?

1:12:55.502 --> 1:12:56.502
Mm-hm.

1:12:58.439 --> 1:13:01.009
Logan came over last week
to help assemble the crib.

1:13:01.042 --> 1:13:02.010
There are a lot of pieces.

1:13:02.042 --> 1:13:03.042
They're confusing.

1:13:03.978 --> 1:13:05.579
How is he?

1:13:05.613 --> 1:13:06.613
Logan?

1:13:07.582 --> 1:13:09.885
Good, yeah.

1:13:09.917 --> 1:13:11.052
Feel a lot better.

1:13:11.086 --> 1:13:13.989
Doing some traveling with work,
going to some cool places.

1:13:17.192 --> 1:13:18.192
Sort of seeing someone.

1:13:20.795 --> 1:13:22.530
Wow, good for him.

1:13:23.465 --> 1:13:24.533
Yeah.

1:13:26.667 --> 1:13:27.802
Have you met her?

1:13:27.836 --> 1:13:29.570
Yeah, actually.

1:13:29.604 --> 1:13:31.606
She hosted a game
night back in October.

1:13:34.676 --> 1:13:35.676
That I won.

1:13:36.578 --> 1:13:37.946
Wow.

1:13:37.979 --> 1:13:39.481
That's really cool for him.

1:13:43.685 --> 1:13:44.786
Is that Doug?

1:13:44.819 --> 1:13:46.188
Doug is getting married?

1:13:46.220 --> 1:13:47.054
Yeah.

1:13:47.087 --> 1:13:48.122
You remember Katrina?

1:13:50.024 --> 1:13:51.059
Wow.

1:13:51.091 --> 1:13:52.427
Isn't that great?

1:13:54.695 --> 1:13:57.198
What, I can mean it and
still feel sorry for myself.

1:13:58.099 --> 1:13:59.099
Okay.

1:14:00.969 --> 1:14:02.570
That's just the case.

1:14:07.140 --> 1:14:10.211
These really don't show how
long this all takes, do they?

1:14:10.244 --> 1:14:11.546
You're telling me.

1:14:15.850 --> 1:14:18.653
Don't you dare take a
picture of me in this state.

1:14:18.685 --> 1:14:19.653
It's clarkmas.

1:14:19.686 --> 1:14:21.155
This is not clarkmas.

1:14:21.189 --> 1:14:22.990
Oh, who says that it isn't?

1:14:24.158 --> 1:14:25.527
Tom, lean in.

1:14:25.560 --> 1:14:26.261
She's only getting
half your head.

1:14:26.293 --> 1:14:27.293
Yeah.

1:14:28.128 --> 1:14:29.597
Oh!

1:14:29.631 --> 1:14:30.699
Say cheese.

1:14:30.731 --> 1:14:31.832
Cheese.

1:14:33.935 --> 1:14:34.935
Oh.

1:14:35.737 --> 1:14:36.738
Can I see?

1:14:36.770 --> 1:14:38.474
- Big, happy family.
- Ah.

1:14:41.109 --> 1:14:42.277
Annie do...

1:14:42.310 --> 1:14:43.786
That's the worst picture of
me in the history of photos.

1:14:43.810 --> 1:14:45.112
That is not true.

1:14:45.145 --> 1:14:46.514
Let's do another one.

1:14:46.547 --> 1:14:47.181
Say baby.

1:14:47.215 --> 1:14:48.215
Baby.

1:15:01.128 --> 1:15:02.863
Tom, what was that?

1:15:02.896 --> 1:15:05.567
Nothing, it's all good.

1:15:05.600 --> 1:15:07.302
It didn't sound like nothing.

1:15:07.335 --> 1:15:08.837
Broken glass
never really hurt anyone.

1:15:08.869 --> 1:15:10.639
I won't fall for that old trick.

1:15:13.341 --> 1:15:14.943
Oh, you woke her up.

1:15:14.975 --> 1:15:17.612
Yeah, that definitely
wasn't you calling to me

1:15:17.645 --> 1:15:18.647
from the other room?

1:15:22.050 --> 1:15:23.018
Do you wanna get
her or should I?

1:15:23.051 --> 1:15:24.619
I'm on it.

1:15:24.652 --> 1:15:26.922
Oh, I have a stockpile
of bottles in the fridge.

1:15:26.954 --> 1:15:29.291
I pumped extra so I can
have a drink tonight.

1:15:29.323 --> 1:15:31.759
Oh, cheers to you.

1:15:33.795 --> 1:15:34.930
I'll get it.

1:15:36.264 --> 1:15:37.766
Oh, we made it.

1:15:37.798 --> 1:15:40.769
I didn't think Hudson
was gonna cooperate.

1:15:42.604 --> 1:15:43.604
Follow him.

1:15:45.372 --> 1:15:47.841
It is a wonder we ever
got out of the house.

1:15:47.875 --> 1:15:49.610
Don't ever have a second child.

1:16:15.369 --> 1:16:17.338
Hello miss Eloise!

1:16:17.372 --> 1:16:18.372
Merry Christmas.

1:16:19.841 --> 1:16:21.943
I thought I'd be the first
one here, it's tradition.

1:16:21.975 --> 1:16:23.978
We started early
for the family crowd.

1:16:24.912 --> 1:16:25.814
Are you enjoying the party?

1:16:25.846 --> 1:16:26.880
Can you say hi?

1:16:26.913 --> 1:16:27.913
- Hi.
- Hi!

1:16:28.983 --> 1:16:30.217
I'm so glad you came.

1:16:30.251 --> 1:16:31.886
Why wouldn't I?

1:16:31.918 --> 1:16:34.622
It's just nice to see
someone without a diaper bag.

1:16:34.655 --> 1:16:35.990
No diapers here.

1:16:37.190 --> 1:16:38.158
You want to hold that clicker?

1:16:38.192 --> 1:16:39.360
Oh my.

1:16:39.394 --> 1:16:41.096
You think you can
push the button?

1:16:42.829 --> 1:16:43.664
Can you take the picture?

1:16:43.698 --> 1:16:44.365
Okay, let's try it.

1:16:44.399 --> 1:16:45.767
Woo!

1:16:47.734 --> 1:16:49.304
Good job!

1:16:49.337 --> 1:16:51.806
Tom decided to set up
drinks out back this year.

1:16:51.838 --> 1:16:53.841
So grab yourself a drink
and I'll be right back.

1:16:53.875 --> 1:16:55.777
I'm just gonna help
him put down Eloise.

1:17:01.181 --> 1:17:02.783
These are amazing.

1:17:02.817 --> 1:17:03.784
Oh, thank you.

1:17:03.818 --> 1:17:04.719
Thank you.

1:17:04.752 --> 1:17:05.795
My son, my son got them for me.

1:17:05.819 --> 1:17:06.987
Hudson?

1:17:07.020 --> 1:17:08.098
Hudson, yeah, he's a sweetheart.

1:17:08.122 --> 1:17:10.225
But aggressive sometimes.

1:17:10.257 --> 1:17:13.394
But what I'm saying is that
aggression isn't innately bad.

1:17:13.427 --> 1:17:15.162
My mother-in-law keeps undoing

1:17:15.195 --> 1:17:16.797
everything we've been working on

1:17:16.831 --> 1:17:19.668
and she's staying three
weeks this Christmas.

1:17:19.701 --> 1:17:20.668
Oh my god.

1:17:20.702 --> 1:17:22.237
Yay for me.

1:17:23.404 --> 1:17:25.840
I don't think we've
met yet, I'm Natalie.

1:17:25.872 --> 1:17:26.974
Annie's cousin.

1:17:27.007 --> 1:17:27.841
Oh, that's so
sweet of you to come.

1:17:27.875 --> 1:17:29.344
Great outfit.

1:17:29.377 --> 1:17:30.377
Thanks.

1:17:31.311 --> 1:17:32.780
And what do you do?

1:17:33.715 --> 1:17:34.815
I'm a psychologist.

1:17:34.849 --> 1:17:36.885
Wow, that's so neat.

1:17:36.917 --> 1:17:37.851
Thanks.

1:17:37.885 --> 1:17:38.853
Yeah, I really like it.

1:17:38.886 --> 1:17:41.823
I wasn't sure I'd find
my place in the field,

1:17:41.855 --> 1:17:43.757
but I'm very happy.

1:17:43.791 --> 1:17:45.894
You must have
your life together.

1:17:45.926 --> 1:17:47.194
No.

1:17:47.228 --> 1:17:48.195
Everybody knows that therapists

1:17:48.229 --> 1:17:50.231
are the worst at relationships.

1:17:53.234 --> 1:17:54.169
What do you do?

1:17:54.202 --> 1:17:55.302
I'm a divorce attorney.

1:18:00.173 --> 1:18:01.876
That seems aggressive.

1:18:01.908 --> 1:18:03.310
I'm not playing!

1:18:04.212 --> 1:18:05.212
Hello, hello!

1:18:07.114 --> 1:18:08.215
Hot mama!

1:18:08.248 --> 1:18:09.384
Nina, you made it!

1:18:11.319 --> 1:18:14.456
And I brought my best sellers,
the holiday macaroon trio,

1:18:14.488 --> 1:18:17.125
gingerbread, peppermint,
spiced eggnog.

1:18:17.158 --> 1:18:18.158
Oh!

1:18:19.159 --> 1:18:21.237
Is it gauche if I put out
business cards next to them?

1:18:21.261 --> 1:18:22.262
Oh my god, I love it.

1:18:22.296 --> 1:18:23.865
Let me see.

1:18:23.898 --> 1:18:27.402
Oh, my mom friends are gonna
flip when they see these.

1:18:27.435 --> 1:18:29.246
You were going to be doing
every child's birthday party

1:18:29.270 --> 1:18:30.371
for the next 18 years.

1:18:30.404 --> 1:18:31.339
Cha-ching, cha-ching.

1:18:31.372 --> 1:18:33.442
Yeah, that's the spirit.

1:18:34.841 --> 1:18:37.077
We're leaving
tomorrow for New York.

1:18:37.110 --> 1:18:42.117
Red eye is the only way to
get Hudson across the country.

1:18:43.283 --> 1:18:44.853
We've avoided
any flights so far.

1:18:44.886 --> 1:18:46.521
I made everyone come to us.

1:18:46.554 --> 1:18:48.856
Yeah, but that won't
last forever, man.

1:18:48.890 --> 1:18:51.392
Knock knock, the
party can start now.

1:18:51.425 --> 1:18:52.360
Hey!

1:18:52.393 --> 1:18:53.895
Hey!

1:18:53.927 --> 1:18:56.363
I still miss just walking
across the hallway

1:18:56.396 --> 1:18:58.932
to get to your party.

1:18:58.966 --> 1:19:00.143
At least you don't have to worry

1:19:00.167 --> 1:19:01.869
about us burning your
place down with ours.

1:19:01.903 --> 1:19:04.372
Where's the baby?

1:19:04.404 --> 1:19:06.006
I'm really good with kids.

1:19:06.039 --> 1:19:07.307
We actually just put her down,

1:19:07.341 --> 1:19:09.978
but I am sure she'll
be up again soon.

1:19:10.011 --> 1:19:11.146
Hey, is that your car

1:19:11.179 --> 1:19:12.780
with the baby on
board sticker on it?

1:19:12.814 --> 1:19:13.847
No, we're the prius.

1:19:13.881 --> 1:19:15.250
Oh good, good.

1:19:15.283 --> 1:19:17.027
Because I really resent
those baby on board cars.

1:19:17.051 --> 1:19:18.419
I just don't get it, you know?

1:19:18.452 --> 1:19:19.929
It's like, what are
they trying to say?

1:19:19.953 --> 1:19:22.322
Like don't hit my car
because I have a kid?

1:19:22.355 --> 1:19:24.458
All right, I won't do it.

1:19:24.492 --> 1:19:26.394
They suddenly want me
to be a good driver

1:19:26.426 --> 1:19:29.329
to avoid hitting
this stranger's brat.

1:19:29.363 --> 1:19:31.365
Or they're just bragging
about having a kid,

1:19:31.399 --> 1:19:32.543
which is not really impressive.

1:19:32.567 --> 1:19:33.467
A lot of people have kids.

1:19:33.501 --> 1:19:34.569
Rats have kids.

1:19:34.601 --> 1:19:36.069
Rats have a lot of kids.

1:19:36.103 --> 1:19:37.280
There's just the kids
all over the place.

1:19:37.304 --> 1:19:39.807
They could be having kids right
under this floor right now.

1:19:39.841 --> 1:19:41.309
Anyone could have a kid, right?

1:19:49.182 --> 1:19:50.318
It's my car actually.

1:19:54.421 --> 1:19:55.255
Cool.

1:19:55.288 --> 1:19:56.190
That's cool.

1:19:56.224 --> 1:19:57.292
No, it's real cool.

1:19:57.324 --> 1:19:58.425
I like a good Honda.

1:19:58.458 --> 1:20:02.229
That's a good sturdy,
sturdy vehicle.

1:20:02.262 --> 1:20:05.199
Good reliable, reliable car.

1:20:06.100 --> 1:20:07.135
This is Mike.

1:20:07.167 --> 1:20:08.268
Mike.

1:20:08.301 --> 1:20:09.136
Cliff.

1:20:09.170 --> 1:20:10.438
Cliff.

1:20:10.470 --> 1:20:11.305
Rats?

1:20:11.338 --> 1:20:12.338
Yeah.

1:20:14.475 --> 1:20:16.152
Babe, just because
your parents are visiting

1:20:16.176 --> 1:20:18.045
doesn't mean I have to
be on good behavior.

1:20:18.078 --> 1:20:19.455
They're sleeping
in the living room,

1:20:19.479 --> 1:20:21.191
you can't play video games
while they're in there.

1:20:21.215 --> 1:20:22.050
I am very quiet.

1:20:22.082 --> 1:20:23.917
Not when you lose.

1:20:24.886 --> 1:20:26.020
I'm gonna get the door.

1:20:26.052 --> 1:20:28.323
First of all, I rarely lose.

1:20:28.355 --> 1:20:31.125
Second of all, I wear a headset.

1:20:31.158 --> 1:20:34.128
You know how I know you lost
three campaigns last night?

1:20:34.161 --> 1:20:37.298
I heard you lose three
campaigns last night.

1:20:39.332 --> 1:20:40.332
Oh, hello.

1:20:41.502 --> 1:20:46.240
Hey, it's nice to see you.

1:20:50.011 --> 1:20:51.579
Come on in.

1:20:51.612 --> 1:20:55.048
Just fill it with sugar water,
the hummingbirds love that.

1:20:55.082 --> 1:20:57.619
Oh, I just did that actually.

1:20:57.652 --> 1:20:58.652
Hey buddy.

1:20:59.386 --> 1:21:00.386
Hey!

1:21:03.690 --> 1:21:04.524
How you doing?

1:21:04.557 --> 1:21:05.393
Been a while.

1:21:05.426 --> 1:21:06.261
Good to see you.

1:21:06.293 --> 1:21:07.427
You too.

1:21:07.461 --> 1:21:08.638
Why don't I take
this into the kitchen?

1:21:08.662 --> 1:21:10.022
As long as I get
the credit for it.

1:21:11.532 --> 1:21:12.967
That sweater's ridiculous.

1:21:13.000 --> 1:21:13.967
You know that, right?

1:21:14.001 --> 1:21:14.936
You don't like this sweater?

1:21:14.969 --> 1:21:15.569
I didn't say didn't like it,

1:21:15.603 --> 1:21:16.603
I said it's ridiculous.

1:21:17.671 --> 1:21:19.640
Another bottle to
add to the stash.

1:21:19.673 --> 1:21:20.608
Ooh.

1:21:20.640 --> 1:21:22.109
It's from Logan, actually.

1:21:22.143 --> 1:21:23.377
This one's fancy.

1:21:23.411 --> 1:21:24.345
I know.

1:21:24.377 --> 1:21:25.947
The party is a huge success.

1:21:25.979 --> 1:21:27.314
You think so?

1:21:27.347 --> 1:21:29.192
My catty mommy and me
friends left a little early.

1:21:29.216 --> 1:21:30.351
But that's because their kid

1:21:30.384 --> 1:21:32.252
almost gave that other
kid a concussion.

1:21:32.286 --> 1:21:34.521
Hudson, he's a maniac.

1:21:34.555 --> 1:21:36.124
They have another
shot with the sister,

1:21:36.157 --> 1:21:37.292
so far she seems sweet.

1:21:37.324 --> 1:21:39.159
I don't know, that's debatable.

1:21:39.193 --> 1:21:40.662
Yeah.

1:21:40.694 --> 1:21:42.996
But it's good that
you had the party.

1:21:43.029 --> 1:21:44.465
Well, why wouldn't I?

1:21:44.497 --> 1:21:47.134
I just thought you
might not want it now.

1:21:47.167 --> 1:21:48.670
Well, things may be different,

1:21:48.703 --> 1:21:50.672
but some things never change.

1:21:50.704 --> 1:21:52.573
I hope it hasn't been
too boring for you.

1:21:52.605 --> 1:21:55.175
No, I've never been
more excited to see cliff,

1:21:55.208 --> 1:21:57.045
but watching him offend
your new friends,

1:21:57.078 --> 1:21:59.314
it's like a sport
in itself, really.

1:21:59.346 --> 1:22:02.516
Oh, could you grab Tom to
do the chestnuts with me?

1:22:02.550 --> 1:22:04.118
It's his project this year.

1:22:04.150 --> 1:22:06.621
We are roasting
chestnuts for the party.

1:22:06.654 --> 1:22:08.089
Nice.

1:22:08.122 --> 1:22:10.158
I got a special pan.

1:22:10.190 --> 1:22:11.259
That's a cool pan.

1:22:11.292 --> 1:22:12.126
It is.

1:22:12.158 --> 1:22:13.293
I'll get Tom.

1:22:13.327 --> 1:22:14.195
- Ready?
- Mm-hm.

1:22:14.228 --> 1:22:15.228
Go.

1:22:19.699 --> 1:22:20.568
Perfect.

1:22:20.600 --> 1:22:22.136
That was great.

1:22:25.605 --> 1:22:27.509
You know, mistletoe
is parasitic.

1:22:30.511 --> 1:22:33.181
Well, would you look at
that, some you and me time

1:22:33.213 --> 1:22:34.315
at one of our parties.

1:22:39.552 --> 1:22:41.555
Well about about that.

1:22:43.757 --> 1:22:45.460
People could walk in, you know.

1:22:45.493 --> 1:22:47.228
Then let them walk in and watch.

1:22:52.565 --> 1:22:54.001
What was that?

1:22:55.770 --> 1:22:57.338
We were supposed
to cut them first!

1:22:57.371 --> 1:22:58.206
Oh!

1:22:58.238 --> 1:22:59.206
Oh, you're right.

1:22:59.239 --> 1:23:00.640
Okay, grab a, grab a shield.

1:23:00.673 --> 1:23:01.673
Protect yourself.

1:23:03.144 --> 1:23:04.078
They're coming down hard.

1:23:04.110 --> 1:23:04.746
Stay alive.

1:23:04.779 --> 1:23:06.180
Oh gosh.

1:23:06.212 --> 1:23:07.648
Watch your face, I'm going in.

1:23:14.822 --> 1:23:16.591
You look pretty lonely out here.

1:23:18.292 --> 1:23:20.061
Is that your diagnosis, doctor?

1:23:20.094 --> 1:23:22.130
Yes, I will have my
secretary bill you.

1:23:24.798 --> 1:23:25.800
How's the party?

1:23:27.534 --> 1:23:29.636
There's only so many
conversations you can have

1:23:29.670 --> 1:23:33.541
about daycare and sleep
training, but c'est la vie.

1:23:33.573 --> 1:23:34.573
La vie.

1:23:35.609 --> 1:23:38.379
So what's your news?

1:23:38.412 --> 1:23:40.148
What's new in the
world of Logan?

1:23:41.548 --> 1:23:43.117
I bought a condo in the fall.

1:23:43.149 --> 1:23:46.620
Wow, congratulations!

1:23:46.654 --> 1:23:49.257
That's, that's adulting!

1:23:49.289 --> 1:23:51.391
My dad helped me
with the down payment.

1:23:51.425 --> 1:23:52.659
Still amazing.

1:23:53.726 --> 1:23:54.726
And you?

1:23:55.796 --> 1:23:58.166
Ugh, so I have to try
and impress you now?

1:23:58.198 --> 1:23:59.433
It's just conversation.

1:24:00.734 --> 1:24:04.439
Well, if you've read
my family Christmas card,

1:24:04.471 --> 1:24:07.541
you'd know that I took up piano,

1:24:07.574 --> 1:24:11.378
traveled to Spain and
joined a mid-sized practice

1:24:11.412 --> 1:24:15.249
taking care of at-risk
children and teens.

1:24:15.282 --> 1:24:17.385
They're not really
at risk per se,

1:24:17.417 --> 1:24:19.420
but my mom wanted it
to sound important.

1:24:20.520 --> 1:24:22.322
I need to get on this
Christmas card list.

1:24:22.355 --> 1:24:23.824
Some years she writes a poem.

1:24:25.592 --> 1:24:27.194
She retired three years ago.

1:24:31.431 --> 1:24:35.469
Hey, I'm sorry things
didn't work out with adler.

1:24:35.502 --> 1:24:36.636
You remember his name.

1:24:36.670 --> 1:24:37.848
It's good you two
broke up though.

1:24:37.872 --> 1:24:39.207
Now listen, hear me out.

1:24:39.239 --> 1:24:42.143
You two are both so good-looking

1:24:42.176 --> 1:24:44.645
that your children would come
out abnormally good looking,

1:24:44.677 --> 1:24:47.247
like so symmetrical
that it's weird.

1:24:47.280 --> 1:24:49.583
What?

1:24:49.617 --> 1:24:50.618
Here's that laugh.

1:24:52.520 --> 1:24:56.124
Would it be rude for me to ask
what happened with you two?

1:24:56.157 --> 1:24:57.625
Yes, incredibly.

1:25:00.426 --> 1:25:04.498
You know when a ship
steers too far to one side,

1:25:04.532 --> 1:25:07.601
and then it overcompensates
in the other direction?

1:25:07.635 --> 1:25:10.872
I guess I was so critical of
everyone that I had been dating

1:25:10.904 --> 1:25:15.109
that I completely ignored
the red flags with adler.

1:25:16.510 --> 1:25:18.613
And eventually I
woke up and realized

1:25:18.645 --> 1:25:20.380
that I was never
in love with him.

1:25:22.216 --> 1:25:24.552
I'm glad you realized how
critical you were of me.

1:25:30.925 --> 1:25:32.427
I did want to say I'm sorry.

1:25:35.261 --> 1:25:37.431
I was a real dick and
I messed things up.

1:25:38.532 --> 1:25:40.467
Which dick thing
are you referring to?

1:25:45.471 --> 1:25:50.478
I really liked you
and it terrified me.

1:25:52.412 --> 1:25:55.382
And then when all the stuff
started happening with my mom,

1:25:56.850 --> 1:25:59.887
she got sick and I
just, I closed off.

1:25:59.920 --> 1:26:00.855
I just disappeared.

1:26:00.887 --> 1:26:02.923
And everything started
to snowball and I just,

1:26:02.957 --> 1:26:04.859
I shut everyone out.

1:26:04.891 --> 1:26:06.626
And by the time she
passed, I just felt

1:26:06.659 --> 1:26:09.630
like too much time had
gone by for me to call you.

1:26:10.965 --> 1:26:12.466
I know it sounds stupid,

1:26:12.498 --> 1:26:14.902
but I thought maybe I
could explain everything

1:26:14.935 --> 1:26:19.941
at their party, but then I
showed up and you were engaged.

1:26:26.913 --> 1:26:31.219
And I just felt like I,
if I told you everything,

1:26:34.555 --> 1:26:36.224
I didn't want to
ruin your engagement.

1:26:37.490 --> 1:26:38.826
Okay, maybe I did, a little.

1:26:43.896 --> 1:26:48.536
Look, I said, I liked
you in the past tense,

1:26:48.569 --> 1:26:51.239
but the truth is
I still like you.

1:26:54.475 --> 1:26:55.843
Does it help at all if I say

1:26:55.876 --> 1:26:57.712
that I've been
meaning to call you?

1:27:01.881 --> 1:27:04.751
Come on, you can't
just be silent.

1:27:08.822 --> 1:27:10.725
We're getting
ready for the photo booth,

1:27:10.757 --> 1:27:11.759
get in here.

1:27:13.426 --> 1:27:15.362
We better get inside.

1:27:16.796 --> 1:27:19.000
Did you hear
anything I just said?

1:27:19.033 --> 1:27:20.033
I did.

1:27:21.335 --> 1:27:22.869
And I, I appreciate it.

1:27:26.372 --> 1:27:30.244
But Logan, I just, I can't.

1:27:34.847 --> 1:27:36.384
We already gave it a chance.

1:27:37.583 --> 1:27:38.583
I'm really sorry.

1:27:50.898 --> 1:27:52.432
So we're all in it together.

1:27:52.466 --> 1:27:56.537
Squeeze uncomfortably close.

1:27:56.569 --> 1:27:58.038
Okay.

1:27:58.072 --> 1:28:00.608
One, two, three.

1:28:00.640 --> 1:28:01.942
Clarkmas!

1:28:03.377 --> 1:28:04.512
Yay!

1:28:04.545 --> 1:28:05.645
Hey, thank you everybody.

1:28:05.679 --> 1:28:06.614
Thank you.

1:28:06.646 --> 1:28:07.814
You can go back to the party.

1:28:07.847 --> 1:28:09.050
Thank you for doing your duty.

1:28:09.082 --> 1:28:12.019
Drinks, food, we
still have food.

1:28:14.520 --> 1:28:18.692
So I saw you guys
outside chatting.

1:28:18.725 --> 1:28:19.725
How'd that go?

1:28:21.095 --> 1:28:22.596
It was nice, man.

1:28:22.628 --> 1:28:24.931
It was, you know, obviously
haven't talked to her

1:28:24.965 --> 1:28:27.868
for a long time, so it
was good to catch up.

1:28:27.900 --> 1:28:28.900
Great.

1:28:29.936 --> 1:28:30.971
It's not happening.

1:28:33.106 --> 1:28:35.909
I put it all out there, man,
but it's, it's too late.

1:28:37.711 --> 1:28:38.711
I missed my shot.

1:28:40.012 --> 1:28:43.050
You know, Annie and I are
doing a little low key thing

1:28:43.082 --> 1:28:45.552
for new year's, you
should come over for it.

1:28:45.586 --> 1:28:49.657
Nah, I got, I got some
friends invited me to a party.

1:28:50.757 --> 1:28:53.094
I think they're
trying to set me up.

1:28:53.127 --> 1:28:57.131
Ah-ha, okay, that's great.

1:28:57.163 --> 1:28:58.099
Be open to that.

1:28:58.131 --> 1:28:59.366
You never know.

1:29:00.434 --> 1:29:02.003
Yeah, totally.

1:29:15.047 --> 1:29:16.617
Destroy that one please.

1:29:17.751 --> 1:29:18.985
It's the best one.

1:29:20.154 --> 1:29:22.990
I'm really glad it worked out.

1:29:23.023 --> 1:29:23.958
Yah, me too.

1:29:23.990 --> 1:29:25.693
It's a great turnout this year.

1:29:27.161 --> 1:29:28.161
I mean, us.

1:29:29.796 --> 1:29:31.731
You're being weird.

1:29:31.765 --> 1:29:35.136
No, you know what
I mean, I just.

1:29:35.168 --> 1:29:36.168
We were lucky.

1:29:38.037 --> 1:29:39.639
Like it's not always that easy.

1:29:44.444 --> 1:29:46.413
It is not always that easy.

1:29:46.447 --> 1:29:47.447
No.

1:29:48.481 --> 1:29:49.483
I think it's your turn.

1:29:49.515 --> 1:29:50.683
Mm-hm.

1:29:50.716 --> 1:29:51.551
I think it is.

1:29:51.585 --> 1:29:52.552
Mm-hm.

1:29:52.586 --> 1:29:55.623
Yeah, I'm not keeping
count, though, I'm not.

1:29:55.655 --> 1:29:58.926
Eloise, sh, sh, sh, you're okay.

1:30:47.207 --> 1:30:48.207
Hey!

1:30:50.978 --> 1:30:54.014
Oh, wow.

1:30:54.046 --> 1:30:55.046
You're going out.

1:30:56.582 --> 1:30:57.518
Yeah.

1:30:57.551 --> 1:30:59.187
Oh, yeah, of course.

1:31:01.020 --> 1:31:02.121
How did you get my address?

1:31:02.154 --> 1:31:03.190
Tom gave it to me.

1:31:04.891 --> 1:31:06.969
You're perpetually late, so
maybe a few minutes later

1:31:06.993 --> 1:31:07.994
won't be a big deal.

1:31:09.195 --> 1:31:11.164
Huh, your place is really clean.

1:31:12.198 --> 1:31:13.733
Are we really doing this?

1:31:13.766 --> 1:31:15.111
So I thought about what
I was gonna say to you

1:31:15.135 --> 1:31:16.570
and how I was gonna deliver it.

1:31:16.603 --> 1:31:18.105
And well, I brought some props.

1:31:18.137 --> 1:31:19.281
So can you please just sit down,

1:31:19.305 --> 1:31:20.707
be quiet and be a good listener?

1:31:20.740 --> 1:31:21.740
Okay?

1:31:27.613 --> 1:31:28.613
Thank you.

1:31:33.153 --> 1:31:35.256
So I was at home, gearing
up for the ball drop

1:31:35.288 --> 1:31:36.890
and I had this
great night planned.

1:31:36.923 --> 1:31:38.658
I was gonna stay home
and had the nice,

1:31:38.692 --> 1:31:41.595
relaxed new year's
that I always wanted.

1:31:41.627 --> 1:31:42.729
And you know what?

1:31:42.762 --> 1:31:43.930
It was nice.

1:31:43.963 --> 1:31:48.601
I ordered delivery and,
oh shit, I ordered delivery.

1:31:48.635 --> 1:31:52.139
Anyway, I was sitting
there and I realize

1:31:52.171 --> 1:31:56.743
that it's not exactly
as I always wanted,

1:31:56.777 --> 1:32:00.314
because really what I
wanted was to be with you.

1:32:00.346 --> 1:32:02.315
And I know it's cheesy and dumb,

1:32:02.349 --> 1:32:06.686
but I thought I might
still have a chance.

1:32:06.720 --> 1:32:11.726
So I don't know how to play
gin rummy, but I googled it,

1:32:12.893 --> 1:32:14.733
and I saw that you just
needed a deck of cards.

1:32:16.063 --> 1:32:18.298
And I wasn't sure what
brand your Nana liked,

1:32:18.332 --> 1:32:20.634
but this was on sale.

1:32:20.667 --> 1:32:22.169
On sale was her brand.

1:32:22.202 --> 1:32:23.771
Okay, shh.

1:32:23.804 --> 1:32:25.180
I know you don't care about
watching the ball drop,

1:32:25.204 --> 1:32:26.273
but I do.

1:32:26.305 --> 1:32:28.675
So I thought we could
compromise with this doohickey.

1:32:30.077 --> 1:32:32.079
Three, two, one, ah!

1:32:33.680 --> 1:32:34.914
Happy new year!

1:32:34.948 --> 1:32:36.717
Whatever you want to
do when the ball drops.

1:32:36.750 --> 1:32:37.585
Can I talk now?

1:32:37.618 --> 1:32:38.618
Not yet.

1:32:39.953 --> 1:32:42.656
Look, I thought about what
you said the other night

1:32:42.689 --> 1:32:46.761
and you did make some
mistakes, and I did too.

1:32:47.694 --> 1:32:49.230
And that's okay.

1:32:50.363 --> 1:32:52.899
And look, I still
think I was right,

1:32:52.932 --> 1:32:57.671
that we gave it a chance,
but I want to be wrong.

1:32:58.872 --> 1:33:01.208
And who knows if
we're meant to be,

1:33:01.240 --> 1:33:03.243
but I want to be.

1:33:06.846 --> 1:33:08.983
It sounded so much
better on drive over.

1:33:13.987 --> 1:33:15.989
Okay, you may speak now.

1:33:19.993 --> 1:33:22.896
Since when do you
believe in meant to be?

1:33:22.929 --> 1:33:24.599
I'm reconsidering my position.

1:33:29.136 --> 1:33:31.872
You know, I'm supposed
to this warehouse party.

1:33:31.904 --> 1:33:32.840
I see what you're doing,

1:33:32.872 --> 1:33:33.673
you're trying to make me squirm.

1:33:33.707 --> 1:33:34.742
I think it's working.

1:33:34.774 --> 1:33:36.210

me the other night?

1:33:49.221 --> 1:33:51.125
You really should
have said love.

1:33:51.158 --> 1:33:52.693
Could have avoided
this whole wait

1:33:52.725 --> 1:33:53.661

1:33:53.694 --> 1:33:55.362
Yeah but, then you
wouldn't be groveling.

1:33:55.395 --> 1:33:56.864
I am not groveling.

1:33:56.896 --> 1:33:57.730
