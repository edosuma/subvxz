_

00:06.646 --> 00:10.282
Are you going to spend the entire
holiday behind your newspaper?

00:17.842 --> 00:19.237
Ecco. (Voilà.)

00:19.704 --> 00:20.904
Happy?

00:28.726 --> 00:29.926
Sì.

00:32.106 --> 00:33.495
Time for my run.

00:33.533 --> 00:35.154
Sun is still too strong.

00:35.177 --> 00:36.597
Ah, nonsense.

00:37.674 --> 00:39.618
Takes work to look this good.

00:42.001 --> 00:43.601
I love you, you know?

00:45.739 --> 00:47.036
I know.

00:53.982 --> 00:55.324
Have a good run.

Hold the lift!

02:42.570 --> 02:43.848
Thanks.

02:43.943 --> 02:45.143
Good morning.

02:45.804 --> 02:48.168
Any idea why they called us in so early?

02:48.169 --> 02:49.479
A hit on a judge.

02:49.503 --> 02:51.154
Yeah, just came in.

02:59.390 --> 03:02.584
I don't suppose you've had
any luck with that task?

03:03.227 --> 03:04.646
- Hmm?
- The medallion.

03:04.766 --> 03:07.469
Oh, nothing yet. Sorry, man.

03:07.589 --> 03:10.175
Requires more digging, but
I've been a little busy.

03:10.222 --> 03:11.951
I'd really appreciate it.

03:12.586 --> 03:13.786
Sure.

03:14.377 --> 03:16.558
Our victim is Gianni Pacetti.

03:16.597 --> 03:19.553
Age 52, a prominent judge from Peruggia.

03:19.583 --> 03:21.221
He was on holiday with his wife.

03:21.244 --> 03:24.245
He was shot through the
heart. A drive-by shooting.

03:24.261 --> 03:26.354
Broad day light, there are no witnesses.

03:26.385 --> 03:28.184
Pacetti is well-regarded.

03:28.223 --> 03:29.883
Known for prosecuting the families.

03:29.911 --> 03:32.448
They stopped hitting
judges back in the 90s.

03:32.480 --> 03:34.515
Well, there has been a
couple of attempts, but

03:34.546 --> 03:36.388
the last one was in 2000.

03:36.413 --> 03:40.073
It was the car bomb that killed
four anti-mafia magistrates.

03:40.116 --> 03:41.581
The Italian government vowed

03:41.593 --> 03:43.932
that it would never
allow it to happen again.

03:43.933 --> 03:46.297
It says here the judge was shot

03:46.298 --> 03:49.338
with a .45 calibre revolver.

03:49.342 --> 03:51.835
It was wiped down so there's no prints.

03:51.857 --> 03:54.149
The serial number was shaved off.

03:54.654 --> 03:56.515
It was left behind at the scene.

03:56.956 --> 03:59.809
It does look like the mafia's M.O.

04:03.376 --> 04:04.971
Our killer

04:04.990 --> 04:07.217
- may have taken a souvenir.
- Why?

04:07.912 --> 04:09.339
A tan line.

04:09.804 --> 04:11.355
This man was wearing a watch.

04:11.392 --> 04:13.824
If he did it wasn't found at the scene.

04:13.849 --> 04:16.082
I have a contact that might be helpful in

04:16.101 --> 04:18.365
- the tribunale de Peruggia.
- Great.

04:18.372 --> 04:19.767
You and Arabela go there,

04:19.774 --> 04:21.567
see if you can figure
out who the late judge

04:21.572 --> 04:23.837
may have pissed off in
the mafia. Sebastian,

04:23.862 --> 04:26.817
I want you to go through all of his
court cases. Ellie you're with him.

04:26.818 --> 04:27.971
Luke,

04:27.972 --> 04:30.078
with me, we're gonna
talk to Pacetti's family.

04:35.217 --> 04:36.668
You're going to tell me what's going on?

04:36.693 --> 04:39.199
I've spoken with the
prime minister in Rome,

04:39.211 --> 04:42.191
if the mafia is behind
the death of this judge,

04:42.192 --> 04:43.292
then there'll be...

04:43.412 --> 04:44.950
repercussions.

04:46.910 --> 04:49.423
_

04:49.424 --> 04:52.191
_

04:55.503 --> 04:56.831
I'm Inspector Strand.

04:56.861 --> 04:59.158
- I'm so sorry for your loss.
- Thank you.

05:00.708 --> 05:02.561
I know that this is a difficult time,

05:02.577 --> 05:03.923
but any insight you have

05:03.927 --> 05:05.832
may help us find your husband's killer.

05:07.698 --> 05:09.008
Because of his job,

05:09.450 --> 05:11.321
my father had many enemies.

05:11.490 --> 05:13.008
The mafia made an attempt on his life

05:13.009 --> 05:14.935
after he sent one of the bosses to prison.

05:15.055 --> 05:16.096
What happened?

05:16.216 --> 05:17.838
The car bomb was a dud.

05:17.958 --> 05:19.317
It was awful.

05:20.031 --> 05:21.624
Carlo was only 14.

05:21.649 --> 05:24.244
Mama begged him to stop
pursuing the families, but

05:24.636 --> 05:25.836
he'd never gave up.

05:26.079 --> 05:28.015
Did anyone know he was going for a run?

05:28.059 --> 05:29.777
He always went jogging at 4pm.

05:30.232 --> 05:32.316
He used to be in the
military. He liked routine.

05:32.376 --> 05:35.453
I was waiting for him to
return, he was never gone long.

05:36.589 --> 05:38.227
Did your father wear a watch?

05:38.406 --> 05:40.893
Zerographe. One of Rolex's first models.

05:40.912 --> 05:42.857
I'm afraid it wasn't on his wrist.

05:43.549 --> 05:44.831
- What?
- We think it may have

05:44.832 --> 05:46.559
been stolen by the perpetrator.

05:46.579 --> 05:49.457
- Do you have a picture?
- I had it repaired last year?

05:49.522 --> 05:51.085
I should have a photo.

05:52.887 --> 05:54.401
Lasciami fare, Mamma.

05:54.862 --> 05:56.167
I can do it.

05:58.295 --> 06:01.332
No one makes you feel more
incompetent than your own children.

06:02.375 --> 06:03.482
There it is.

06:07.209 --> 06:08.515
Nice piece.

06:08.702 --> 06:09.912
He never took it off.

06:09.949 --> 06:12.139
We'll do our best to retrieve it for you.

06:12.164 --> 06:13.584
Will you send this to me?

06:14.025 --> 06:16.221
_

06:16.289 --> 06:18.187
_

06:18.307 --> 06:22.182
Looks like Pacetti was presiding
over a drug trafficking operation

06:22.182 --> 06:24.260
from Italy to Oslo.

06:24.434 --> 06:26.952
The supplier he was trying
to prosecute is called

06:26.977 --> 06:29.037
Bandar Tartalia?

06:33.926 --> 06:37.437
Pacetti sent the head
of that family to prison.

06:37.557 --> 06:40.109
Good enough reason to have him taken out.

06:42.907 --> 06:44.204
Nice bag.

06:44.324 --> 06:45.748
Is Erik here?

06:46.282 --> 06:48.261
Oh no, he's at school.

06:48.273 --> 06:50.550
Without his sport kit, or lunch.

06:50.568 --> 06:53.223
Well why don't you get
reception to bike it over?

06:57.485 --> 07:00.791
Pretty cool having your
lunch delivered from the ICC.

07:01.021 --> 07:03.707
- _
- Yeah. Thanks.

07:09.246 --> 07:10.332
Carine?

07:10.400 --> 07:12.186
Hey, Sebastian, any joy?

07:12.679 --> 07:15.691
Uh, Pacetti was fighting the good fight.

07:15.896 --> 07:18.142
Against one particular mafia family.

07:18.262 --> 07:19.761
He convicted their boss,

07:19.792 --> 07:22.162
- Luciano Lucarelli.
- When?

07:22.230 --> 07:24.098
In March 2009.

07:24.104 --> 07:27.002
That's right about when they
said there was an attempt on his life.

07:27.122 --> 07:29.353
Marco was right. He did wear a watch.

07:29.359 --> 07:31.847
Not just any watch. It
was a Rolex Zerographe.

07:31.859 --> 07:33.059
Wow.

07:33.060 --> 07:35.122
A piece that rare should
float to the surface.

07:35.128 --> 07:36.987
I sent you a photo. Check your email.

07:41.165 --> 07:42.356
Nice.

07:42.388 --> 07:43.982
Check online market places,

07:43.995 --> 07:46.191
and Ellie, get the word
out to local pawnshops

07:46.197 --> 07:47.643
and classified advertisement.

07:47.668 --> 07:50.050
If they are smart, they'll
try to sell it on the Dark Web.

07:50.075 --> 07:51.309
You mean like Silk Road?

07:51.310 --> 07:54.169
No, the FBI closed them down
last year. Now it's, uh...

07:54.194 --> 07:56.073
Evolution or Miras.

07:56.079 --> 07:58.771
Anywhere with heavy
encryptions for anonymity.

07:58.778 --> 08:00.707
So, even if we find the watch,

08:00.726 --> 08:02.636
you might not be able to trace the seller?

08:02.661 --> 08:05.570
It's not impossible. There's always
a way to get around the system.

08:05.577 --> 08:08.356
- Legally?
- The FBI wasn't prosecuted, so...

08:08.368 --> 08:10.037
it's a bit of a grey area, really.

08:10.157 --> 08:11.047
All the same.

08:11.066 --> 08:13.392
Get the clearance. We need
to be by the book on this one.

08:13.512 --> 08:15.358
Emma Pacetti didn't seem to want her son

08:15.359 --> 08:16.892
to see what was on her phone.

08:16.893 --> 08:18.093
Ellie?

08:18.293 --> 08:19.534
Can you check her out?

08:19.885 --> 08:21.131
On it now.

08:21.920 --> 08:24.095
_

08:24.111 --> 08:26.595
_

08:29.943 --> 08:31.328
So you admit you had a motive

08:31.353 --> 08:32.926
to kill the judge, Señor Lucarelli?

08:32.955 --> 08:35.967
I have lost no sleep
over the judge's death.

08:36.171 --> 08:37.690
But I had nothing to do with it.

08:37.700 --> 08:39.130
Just like you had nothing to do with

08:39.131 --> 08:41.179
the massacre of Vilas Joe Gofoli.

08:41.198 --> 08:44.435
Or the killing of the Palermo
chief of police 12 years ago?

08:44.495 --> 08:45.909
She's good,

08:46.083 --> 08:48.624
but what a bigmouth, right?

08:48.664 --> 08:50.510
I wish I could return the compliment.

08:52.689 --> 08:55.513
A hit on a judge is bad for business.

08:55.558 --> 08:56.799
Un-touristic.

08:57.072 --> 08:59.504
Having a drug ring shut
down is bad for business.

08:59.514 --> 09:01.321
And well worth the risk.

09:02.661 --> 09:03.882
Grazie.

09:05.445 --> 09:06.696
I'm retired.

09:06.711 --> 09:08.443
But you're still running the family,

09:08.453 --> 09:10.437
and the drug trade from in here.

09:10.443 --> 09:11.356
How?

09:11.594 --> 09:12.840
People follow me around,

09:12.855 --> 09:14.468
listen to every conversation,

09:14.482 --> 09:16.110
tap every phone call.

09:16.140 --> 09:19.331
Anything you've heard is only propaganda.

09:19.382 --> 09:21.015
My efforts to keep my

09:21.084 --> 09:22.935
professional reputation.

09:23.794 --> 09:27.060
My sentence was cut by 18
months, for good behaviour.

09:27.388 --> 09:28.703
In private,

09:28.768 --> 09:32.143
I simply wish to go home, and
play with my grandchildren.

09:32.180 --> 09:33.269
Perhaps.

09:33.314 --> 09:35.180
But all the time, money and blood,

09:35.220 --> 09:37.744
put in to wrestling
control of the heroin trade

09:37.782 --> 09:40.193
and now, Judge Pacetti comes along,

09:40.203 --> 09:42.203
to close it down with this case.

09:42.396 --> 09:44.408
There was no case.

09:44.813 --> 09:46.333
Pacetti knew this.

09:46.534 --> 09:48.216
Look at it and you'll see,

09:48.465 --> 09:50.535
I didn't need to lift a finger.

09:50.567 --> 09:52.599
And when you lift a finger, people die.

09:52.606 --> 09:56.129
Pacetti wasn't worth the trouble.

10:05.793 --> 10:07.266
Carine?

10:07.386 --> 10:09.833
- Where are you?
- Headed back to the office.

10:09.841 --> 10:11.826
Arabela and Marco interviewed Lucarelli,

10:11.849 --> 10:14.648
- he claims he's innocent.
- Well, of course he does.

10:15.354 --> 10:17.959
None of this surprises
you, does it, Michel?

10:17.990 --> 10:19.726
Be patient, Carine.

10:20.883 --> 10:23.555
_

10:23.620 --> 10:26.693
_

10:36.742 --> 10:38.603
Miss Clerkenwell.

10:40.068 --> 10:41.463
Mr. Dorn.

10:46.256 --> 10:50.073
How lovely it was for you to have
taken time from your vacation to

10:50.408 --> 10:52.017
have this little chat with me.

10:52.033 --> 10:55.972
It isn't everyday the ICC's
chief prosecutor asks to see me.

10:56.026 --> 10:58.562
But that it could be everyday.

10:59.112 --> 11:00.859
How are you, dear Jane?

11:01.951 --> 11:03.592
Enjoying my holiday.

11:04.243 --> 11:06.842
But I assume you didn't fly
down here for the sunshine.

11:06.865 --> 11:09.641
No, Gianni Pacetti, the Italian judge of

11:09.761 --> 11:13.154
mafia convictions fame has been murdered.

11:13.155 --> 11:16.534
- Perhaps assassinated.
- Yes. Awful business that.

11:16.557 --> 11:19.186
The prevailing theory
is that Pacetti's death

11:19.306 --> 11:21.672
was ordered by a mafia boss.

11:22.636 --> 11:24.629
I may have heard that.

11:24.661 --> 11:25.901
Have you heard that

11:25.925 --> 11:28.098
certain Italian politicians are demanding

11:28.099 --> 11:30.167
that their government responds with a

11:30.492 --> 11:32.437
merciless crackdown?

11:33.139 --> 11:34.339
And your point?

11:34.938 --> 11:36.646
My point is

11:37.225 --> 11:41.538
that there are a dozen undercover
agents embedded in Calabria.

11:41.658 --> 11:43.097
A few of them,

11:43.366 --> 11:45.476
being yours from MI6.

11:45.501 --> 11:47.897
We have worked unswervingly for years

11:47.928 --> 11:51.255
to provide us with the evidence
that we needed to prosecute

11:51.263 --> 11:53.853
and convict those mafia bosses.

11:55.155 --> 11:57.322
This crackdown were to occur

11:57.846 --> 12:01.584
all their work, and quite
possibly their lives, would be lost.

12:01.607 --> 12:04.375
- Tell me what you want.
- Confirmation.

12:05.112 --> 12:08.322
From the eyes and ears you have
on the ground there. I need to know

12:08.361 --> 12:11.959
whether the mafia has any
discernible connection to this murder.

12:11.970 --> 12:14.563
- Well, your team is investigating on this?
- Yes they are.

12:14.683 --> 12:16.789
But I am under pressure from Rome.

12:17.174 --> 12:20.075
If we do not have an
arrest within 24 hours,

12:20.415 --> 12:22.749
we will not be able to restrain them.

12:23.594 --> 12:24.794
Hmm.

12:26.595 --> 12:28.555
What do I get in return?

12:28.775 --> 12:30.201
Jane...

12:31.361 --> 12:33.849
most of these agents are yours.

12:33.874 --> 12:37.410
Be that as it may, there is such a
thing as the Official Secrets Act.

12:37.530 --> 12:38.887
Dinner.

12:43.167 --> 12:46.227
I am looking for a quid pro quo.

12:47.249 --> 12:51.306
How many quid is your quo going to cost me?

12:51.343 --> 12:53.064
When the time comes,

12:53.663 --> 12:55.272
I'll let you know.

13:00.094 --> 13:01.294
Wow.

13:01.295 --> 13:05.291
Señor Pacetti spent a lot
of money on spa treatments,

13:05.303 --> 13:07.586
dinners out and hotel suites.

13:07.598 --> 13:10.507
- It's all right for some.
- That's sort of sweet, isn't it?

13:10.533 --> 13:13.324
Romantic that they still
did those things together.

13:13.330 --> 13:14.792
If they were together.

13:15.256 --> 13:16.724
Cynic.

13:17.667 --> 13:19.411
Check the husband's diary.

13:19.423 --> 13:22.047
Fine, I will. I've got it here.

13:22.369 --> 13:24.331
Anyway, have you got anything on the watch?

13:24.884 --> 13:27.295
No, nothing yet.

13:29.121 --> 13:31.032
Is that an RPG for sale?

13:32.999 --> 13:34.543
Why, you interested?

13:36.157 --> 13:38.301
Welcome to the Dark Web.

13:38.316 --> 13:41.107
Where evil does its online shopping.

13:41.138 --> 13:42.729
Mercy piece for MDMA.

13:42.931 --> 13:44.550
Hitman for hire.

13:45.017 --> 13:46.964
- Oh my God.
- What?

13:47.851 --> 13:49.166
You were right.

13:49.191 --> 13:51.784
Señora Pacetti was away
on romantic weekends,

13:51.796 --> 13:53.651
while her husband was in court.

13:54.315 --> 13:57.547
Carine was right about her having
something to hide. She has a lover.

13:57.572 --> 13:58.931
And more than that.

13:59.222 --> 14:00.674
She has a motive.

14:07.492 --> 14:10.099
Tell me about Piero Alecastro.

14:10.748 --> 14:12.110
He's a friend.

14:13.211 --> 14:16.584
A friend you've called over
500 times in the last 3 months.

14:20.562 --> 14:22.237
We were having an affair.

14:22.851 --> 14:24.305
It's over now.

14:25.202 --> 14:26.462
Did your husband know?

14:26.582 --> 14:27.826
Yes.

14:27.946 --> 14:29.669
We were working through it.

14:32.609 --> 14:35.000
I suppose you find this all very tasteless.

14:35.761 --> 14:37.693
You know what I find tasteless?

14:37.950 --> 14:40.941
Picking through the details of
other people's lives like this.

14:42.230 --> 14:43.980
You're wasting your time.

14:44.619 --> 14:47.987
Most murders come out of
intimate personal conflict.

14:49.067 --> 14:50.890
I loved my husband.

14:51.666 --> 14:53.584
You find that hard to imagine.

14:54.954 --> 14:56.704
Are you married, Inspector?

14:57.494 --> 14:58.694
No.

14:58.788 --> 15:00.271
You're still young.

15:00.792 --> 15:02.267
Are you in love?

15:03.081 --> 15:05.074
Hmm. The older one is

15:05.075 --> 15:07.790
then the one realises how strange love is.

15:08.337 --> 15:10.570
How many different forms it takes.

15:10.690 --> 15:12.405
How it causes pain.

15:12.756 --> 15:14.589
Gianni's work was his passion.

15:14.709 --> 15:16.230
He was single-minded.

15:17.150 --> 15:19.191
He had his little secrets too.

15:19.539 --> 15:20.879
And Piero?

15:21.443 --> 15:22.826
Is he the jealous type?

15:22.999 --> 15:24.199
No.

15:24.607 --> 15:26.791
He had no desire to break up our marriage.

15:26.911 --> 15:29.170
I'm sure he'd be telling
you all this himself.

15:33.070 --> 15:35.297
Thank you for your time,  Señora Pacetti

15:35.316 --> 15:36.817
Emma, please.

15:37.115 --> 15:38.715
Can I ask you something?

15:39.917 --> 15:41.117
Sure.

15:42.350 --> 15:44.181
Please, don't tell Carlo.

15:45.949 --> 15:47.252
When it comes to love

15:47.283 --> 15:49.766
the young are so much more
idealistic than the old.

16:04.617 --> 16:06.267
I was here, working.

16:06.311 --> 16:08.004
You can ask my team.

16:08.389 --> 16:10.839
Their job doesn't count many spare hours.

16:10.851 --> 16:13.946
And those spare hours, you like
to spend with Señora Pacetti.

16:13.953 --> 16:14.970
Va bene.

16:15.158 --> 16:17.267
I used to. When she was free.

16:17.484 --> 16:19.035
When did you last see her?

16:19.043 --> 16:21.853
Three weeks ago. Haven't
heard from her since.

16:21.878 --> 16:23.722
I thought she had a change of heart.

16:25.259 --> 16:26.974
I know what you're thinking.

16:27.197 --> 16:29.732
That I bumped him off
so we could be together.

16:29.990 --> 16:31.489
What would be the point?

16:31.520 --> 16:33.196
I know what I am to her.

16:33.421 --> 16:34.666
A distraction.

16:34.734 --> 16:37.228
Did the two of you ever
discuss her marriage?

16:37.272 --> 16:38.676
Sometimes.

16:38.847 --> 16:40.978
Her husband could be a difficult prick.

16:42.302 --> 16:44.914
He had a very good
reputation professionally.

16:44.915 --> 16:46.061
Señor.

16:46.086 --> 16:47.749
- Vale.
- He was very well liked.

16:48.356 --> 16:50.509
Look, I'm just telling you what I know.

16:50.629 --> 16:53.065
People are different behind closed doors.

16:54.696 --> 16:55.896
And?

16:56.315 --> 16:58.102
She said he was controlling.

16:58.139 --> 17:00.335
I'm sure he hit her once or twice.

17:04.963 --> 17:06.280
Got it.

17:06.827 --> 17:10.125
It's a Rolex Zerographe from 1937.

17:10.150 --> 17:12.007
It's got to be Pacetti's.

17:12.222 --> 17:14.523
The seller's asking for 100,000 Euros.

17:14.567 --> 17:16.720
Yeah. Fraction of its value.

17:16.732 --> 17:17.967
Can you track the seller?

17:17.990 --> 17:21.409
I made an offer in an attempt to
get him to engage in conversation.

17:21.523 --> 17:23.406
I've set up a fake IM account

17:23.457 --> 17:24.926
for him to respond to it.

17:27.147 --> 17:29.325
Sebastian's found the anonymous seller.

17:29.350 --> 17:30.942
We think he might be Pacetti's Rolex.

17:30.948 --> 17:33.039
- Great.
- Tracking him now.

17:33.653 --> 17:36.283
Got him through his Bitcoin account.

17:39.807 --> 17:41.190
He's in Italy.

17:41.240 --> 17:43.523
Traced him to a tower in Ancona.

17:43.524 --> 17:46.303
- Via Belvederino, 932.
- OK, good.

17:51.744 --> 17:54.138
Looks like we've found our fence.

17:58.574 --> 17:59.858
Hands up!

18:00.265 --> 18:01.465
Now.

18:06.557 --> 18:08.740
Quite an operation you're running here.

18:08.784 --> 18:11.534
Lidocaine, passports, credit cards.

18:16.998 --> 18:18.438
And...

18:20.156 --> 18:21.645
this watch.

18:21.986 --> 18:23.487
A Rolex.

18:24.591 --> 18:26.353
Rush this to the forensics lab.

18:26.359 --> 18:28.462
- Velocemente.
- Sì, chef.

18:28.507 --> 18:30.025
Where did you get it from?

18:30.540 --> 18:32.792
I found it. In the street.

18:32.835 --> 18:34.952
Oh, I wanna know the
street where I can find

18:34.976 --> 18:38.419
a $400,000 watch. Sounds
like a place I wanna visit.

18:38.773 --> 18:40.423
I'm just lucky.

18:41.484 --> 18:42.898
Debatable.

18:43.024 --> 18:44.860
Since this watch was stolen

18:44.861 --> 18:47.381
from a murdered man's
wrist, just yesterday.

18:48.758 --> 18:50.917
I... I don't know anything about a murder.

18:50.972 --> 18:53.720
- I... I didn't kill anyone!
- Then who gave it to you?

18:55.462 --> 18:56.662
Look,

18:57.033 --> 18:59.806
- I... I'm just the middle man.
- Just the middle man.

19:01.964 --> 19:04.533
You think a jury will buy his story?

19:04.582 --> 19:07.709
After our beloved judge
was so brutally murdered.

19:10.612 --> 19:12.430
How lucky are you feeling?

19:16.549 --> 19:18.559
Nice work, Sebastian.

19:18.679 --> 19:19.781
Thanks.

19:19.974 --> 19:22.614
- I've been meaning to talk to you.
- Yeah?

19:22.734 --> 19:25.135
I know we didn't get off to the best start.

19:25.147 --> 19:27.207
Well, you hacked Luke's phone.

19:28.937 --> 19:31.009
I think you're brilliant, Sebastian.

19:31.010 --> 19:32.952
But you are a law enforcement officer,

19:32.970 --> 19:35.694
and you may get a habit
of ignoring the law.

19:36.829 --> 19:38.144
I understand.

19:38.497 --> 19:39.831
I apologize.

19:43.174 --> 19:45.519
What about the medallion
I'm researching for Marco?

19:45.532 --> 19:46.512
What about it?

19:46.568 --> 19:49.397
It's not part of any ICC
investigation that I'm aware of.

19:49.403 --> 19:51.208
No, it's a separate matter.

19:51.220 --> 19:54.545
You have my OK to do anything you
can to help Marco with his sister.

19:54.564 --> 19:55.842
His sister?

19:55.885 --> 19:58.559
- What's it got to do with his sister?
- Marco?

19:58.764 --> 20:01.231
The guy who gave the watch to our fence

20:01.232 --> 20:03.293
is called Romano Acerbi.

20:03.318 --> 20:05.185
OK, I'll get Sebastian on it.

20:05.197 --> 20:06.562
I know where he lives.

20:06.587 --> 20:09.236
- I'm outside his flat right now.
- OK.

20:10.631 --> 20:12.603
Hate to miss the party.

20:12.723 --> 20:15.370
- You miss me?
- Like a hole in the head.

20:42.170 --> 20:44.059
Just want to talk Romano.

20:48.497 --> 20:50.398
Obviously not the talking type.

20:55.046 --> 20:56.246
Clear.

21:11.565 --> 21:12.765
He's running!

21:13.908 --> 21:15.357
I'll take the front.

21:45.750 --> 21:47.984
- What's that?
- He's on the roof.

22:19.193 --> 22:22.216
- We need this clown alive.
- Best of luck with that.

22:30.004 --> 22:32.243
- OK, let's box him in.
- Cover with fire.

22:32.262 --> 22:33.462
Go!

23:58.978 --> 24:01.537
- He's out!
- Stop!

24:09.101 --> 24:10.745
Hey! Stop!

24:11.776 --> 24:14.173
- Give it up!
- Romano!

24:16.313 --> 24:17.867
No! No!

24:36.964 --> 24:38.895
That was a bit hairy, wasn't it?

24:41.955 --> 24:44.330
- You all right?
- Yeah.

24:47.316 --> 24:49.875
When I saw him fall, for a moment I, um...

24:49.995 --> 24:51.472
thought it was you.

24:52.561 --> 24:54.377
Can't get rid of me that easily.

24:55.584 --> 24:57.934
It's good to know you've so
much faith in my skills though.

25:11.239 --> 25:12.678
Not a good idea.

25:12.887 --> 25:16.269
- What?
- Work life, home life. Get them separate.

25:16.584 --> 25:18.184
What? You think I'm...

25:18.557 --> 25:19.827
with her?

25:20.603 --> 25:22.059
Come on, it's like she...

25:22.396 --> 25:25.001
It's not like that.
She's a... she's a mate.

25:25.964 --> 25:28.837
- She's...
- Just... just save it.

25:29.269 --> 25:32.594
Look what I found in Romano's
apartment. 38,000 Euros.

25:32.604 --> 25:34.969
A good price for a hit on a judge, uh?

25:38.556 --> 25:42.036
- Who's that?
- Romano Acerbi. Age 20.

25:42.041 --> 25:45.504
- Forensics found Pacetti's blood on his watch.
- That puts him at the scene,

25:45.528 --> 25:46.930
but we don't know why he did it.

25:46.949 --> 25:48.445
We know next to nothing about him.

25:48.476 --> 25:51.018
Well, troubled youth, expelled from school,

25:51.033 --> 25:52.477
increased criminal activity.

25:52.487 --> 25:54.581
Yes, but nothing in this league before.

25:54.601 --> 25:55.371
Look,

25:55.836 --> 25:57.783
The coroner in Ancona sent over some photos

25:57.784 --> 25:59.578
- of the body.
- Is that a tattoo?

25:59.588 --> 26:01.777
Uh, mark of gang perhaps?

26:01.897 --> 26:03.762
Well, certainly an insignia.

26:03.844 --> 26:05.062
Check it out.

26:06.095 --> 26:07.882
So, this is our killer?

26:07.931 --> 26:09.919
Yes, but he isn't an opportunist thief,

26:09.939 --> 26:11.881
this was a planned assassination.

26:11.900 --> 26:14.555
Marco found the entire
ransom in his apartment.

26:14.565 --> 26:17.160
- If it wasn't mafia...
- No, it wasn't mafia.

26:17.280 --> 26:19.468
It was just made to look like it was.

26:19.646 --> 26:21.373
Marco said they found

26:21.393 --> 26:24.049
38,000 in cash in
Romano's apartment, right?

26:24.050 --> 26:26.092
- Yes.
- Hold on.

26:28.790 --> 26:31.560
Señora Pacetti made cash withdrawals

26:31.564 --> 26:34.284
that totalled 38,000
Euros in the past week.

26:34.290 --> 26:37.268
Proving cash exchanged hands
is next to impossible.

26:37.313 --> 26:39.050
Sebastian, have forensics in Ancona

26:39.065 --> 26:41.472
see if they can pull any
prints off of the bills.

26:41.560 --> 26:42.760
Will do.

26:43.190 --> 26:44.624
Nice work, Ellie.

26:48.957 --> 26:50.520
Señora Pacetti.

26:50.708 --> 26:51.859
I told you, Emma.

26:51.860 --> 26:53.671
This is Inspector Costante.

26:53.711 --> 26:57.457
We have some information about
the death of your husband.

26:58.932 --> 27:00.600
We found the man who shot him.

27:00.907 --> 27:02.446
Oh my God.

27:02.823 --> 27:03.973
Who?

27:04.455 --> 27:06.539
Well, we don't have much on him.

27:06.659 --> 27:08.544
He died defying arrest.

27:08.926 --> 27:10.515
Why did he hurt Gianni?

27:10.971 --> 27:12.738
Well, we think he was paid.

27:13.010 --> 27:14.222
By whom?

27:14.525 --> 27:16.461
We also spoke to Piero...

27:17.587 --> 27:20.312
who implied your husband
was a difficult man.

27:20.432 --> 27:21.463
He was.

27:21.703 --> 27:23.726
I think it's common in great men.

27:23.990 --> 27:25.374
He was also kind.

27:25.450 --> 27:27.389
He was known for his sense of humour.

27:28.011 --> 27:30.627
It is also common in great men,

27:30.666 --> 27:32.924
they keep one face for the public

27:32.934 --> 27:34.746
and another one behind closed doors.

27:35.018 --> 27:36.959
I think he mellowed as he aged.

27:36.979 --> 27:38.259
Perhaps we both did.

27:38.825 --> 27:40.319
Did he ever hurt you?

27:41.892 --> 27:43.277
Certainly not.

27:43.297 --> 27:45.832
Thing is, we found 38,000 Euros

27:45.837 --> 27:47.390
in the perpetrator's flat.

27:47.420 --> 27:49.862
And there were withdrawals
amounting to that sum

27:49.877 --> 27:51.772
from your account in the last week.

27:51.787 --> 27:53.380
Well, that's nothing unusual.

27:53.451 --> 27:55.342
- I like to shop.
- So your prints will not be found

27:55.357 --> 27:57.065
- on any of those bills?
- I sincerely doubt it.

27:57.090 --> 27:59.546
And you never met Romano Acerbi?

28:00.757 --> 28:01.938
No.

28:02.707 --> 28:03.933
She's lying.

28:04.053 --> 28:05.090
Yep.

28:05.210 --> 28:06.598
But I don't think that she did it.

28:06.638 --> 28:07.874
Did you see it?

28:08.092 --> 28:11.050
The military crest Carlo was
wearing in that photograph?

28:11.214 --> 28:12.216
Look familiar?

28:12.336 --> 28:13.531
Yeah.

28:13.755 --> 28:15.899
That connects Romano to Carlo.

28:16.371 --> 28:19.170
I saw genuine shock on her face.

28:19.234 --> 28:21.090
She's trying to protect her son.

28:21.109 --> 28:22.881
We need to get a tap
on her phone right now.

28:22.886 --> 28:24.467
She'll be calling him any time.

28:24.468 --> 28:26.904
_

28:26.905 --> 28:29.782
_

28:30.079 --> 28:33.846
Carlo Pacetti went to
Mazzini Military Academy.

28:34.862 --> 28:37.170
Yeah, parents of a 16-year-old sued

28:37.171 --> 28:39.829
after their son was
branded by a senior student.

28:39.976 --> 28:41.772
I mean, it's famous for bullying.

28:41.812 --> 28:44.576
Bring up the academy class
list from 4 years ago.

28:44.611 --> 28:45.480
OK.

28:48.205 --> 28:51.272
Carlo's class list 2010 to 2011.

28:51.392 --> 28:52.925
Luis Gianni...

28:52.937 --> 28:57.402
Santino Cresta, Federico
Guerri, Enzo Bollato.

28:57.662 --> 28:58.995
Romano.

28:59.008 --> 29:00.335
Romano Acerbi.

29:00.372 --> 29:02.120
Carlo and Romano were classmates.

29:02.121 --> 29:03.399
Where's Carine?

29:03.519 --> 29:05.602
Oh, I think she's with Dorn.

29:09.436 --> 29:11.713
Sorry. I'm going permission for a phone tap

29:11.732 --> 29:14.188
- on Emma Pacetti's line. Right now.
- Do it.

29:15.044 --> 29:17.693
- I can't get a hit on Carlo's phone.
- Why?

29:18.004 --> 29:20.162
Looks like it's been turned off all day.

29:20.198 --> 29:22.402
Well, try something else then.

29:22.427 --> 29:25.262
Already did. I've connected to
Señora Pacetti's direct line.

29:25.267 --> 29:27.641
- Any call she makes will be audible to us.
- Good.

29:27.855 --> 29:31.651
Friendly reminder: we can only
listen to calls to or from Carlo.

29:31.664 --> 29:32.836
Carine...

29:33.965 --> 29:36.025
Right, of course.

29:38.426 --> 29:39.809
She's making a call.

29:39.853 --> 29:41.168
It's to Carlo's cell.

29:41.174 --> 29:42.502
Hey. It's Carlo.

29:42.526 --> 29:43.742
Leave a message.

29:43.773 --> 29:45.250
Carlo, it's Mama.

29:45.312 --> 29:46.621
Please.

29:46.919 --> 29:48.662
Please, call me.

29:49.314 --> 29:51.212
Well, we can't locate him with that.

29:51.274 --> 29:54.370
Nope. Not with his phone shut down.

30:02.385 --> 30:04.650
Señora Pacetti's receiving a call.

30:05.145 --> 30:08.019
It's from a prepaid phone.

30:08.068 --> 30:09.092
Mama?

30:09.117 --> 30:11.859
- Carlo, where are you?
- I'm tracking him now.

30:11.902 --> 30:14.687
- Police came to visit...
- I should be able to get his location.

30:14.705 --> 30:17.521
- ... asking me questions about the money.
- I can explain.

30:17.866 --> 30:19.336
Why did you need it?

30:20.018 --> 30:21.135
Please?

30:21.364 --> 30:24.267
- Please tell me.
- It's nothing to worry about.

30:24.280 --> 30:27.277
They're saying Romano killed Papa.

30:27.488 --> 30:29.412
Is that true?

30:29.430 --> 30:30.845
Please, tell me.

30:31.080 --> 30:33.624
I promise I'll explain.

30:33.667 --> 30:35.888
- I can't right now.
- Got him.

30:36.062 --> 30:37.612
He's on his way to Rome.

30:37.732 --> 30:38.815
OK.

30:38.865 --> 30:40.298
I love you, Mama.

30:41.991 --> 30:43.424
I love you too.

30:43.424 --> 30:45.602
How much heartbreak can one woman take?

30:49.819 --> 30:51.606
She hasn't hung up yet.

30:58.702 --> 31:00.638
Find my son.

31:01.835 --> 31:03.901
But don't hurt him.

31:15.939 --> 31:19.089
_

32:14.417 --> 32:16.403
Hey, wait!

32:16.824 --> 32:18.182
Marco!

32:20.000 --> 32:21.830
- Stop!
- Stop!

32:21.879 --> 32:23.120
I said stop!

32:23.139 --> 32:24.670
No! Don't shoot!

32:42.312 --> 32:43.590
Come on.

32:46.890 --> 32:50.005
What have you got on Carlo and Romano?

32:50.061 --> 32:54.093
At Mazzini, both Romano and
Carlo had disciplinary marks.

32:54.124 --> 32:57.691
Insubordination, disorderly
conduct, conduct unbecoming.

32:58.063 --> 33:00.861
Looks like Romano was
expelled in their second year.

33:00.917 --> 33:02.164
What for?

33:02.232 --> 33:04.850
Disciplinary file says he was smoking pot

33:04.900 --> 33:06.233
on academy grounds and

33:06.270 --> 33:07.970
Carlo was caught smoking with him.

33:07.982 --> 33:10.358
- But Carlo wasn't expelled.
- No.

33:10.606 --> 33:12.025
Only Romano.

33:12.488 --> 33:15.749
So, Carlo's father cut
a deal with the academy,

33:15.774 --> 33:17.735
and Romano was sent packing.

33:17.753 --> 33:20.036
While Carlo lives off his wealthy family.

33:20.054 --> 33:22.068
Actually, from Carlo's bank statements,

33:22.078 --> 33:24.390
his father had recently
stopped his allowance.

33:24.832 --> 33:26.698
That's why he went to
his mom for the money.

33:26.714 --> 33:29.841
Seems like a pretty extreme
reaction to resort to murder.

33:29.860 --> 33:31.349
Whatever went on at that school.

33:31.374 --> 33:33.364
Nah, there's more to
this than money, it's...

33:34.531 --> 33:36.030
Ellie, would you mind pulling up

33:36.065 --> 33:38.646
the medical records for
the Pacetti family for me?

33:41.117 --> 33:42.169
Why run?

33:42.432 --> 33:43.767
I was freaked out.

33:44.403 --> 33:47.757
My father'd just been murdered, and
you've been arresting my mother.

33:50.124 --> 33:51.995
Let's talk about Romano.

33:52.675 --> 33:54.496
He was your friend, right?

33:55.578 --> 33:57.275
I see him from time to time.

33:57.673 --> 33:59.608
He comes around asking me for help.

34:00.090 --> 34:02.134
My father taught us we must be generous.

34:02.625 --> 34:04.109
There's generous,

34:04.471 --> 34:06.709
and then there's 38,000 Euros.

34:07.761 --> 34:10.322
We found your fingerprints
on the bank notes.

34:14.400 --> 34:15.909
I gave him the money.

34:16.851 --> 34:19.443
He said his grandmother
needed for an operation.

34:20.583 --> 34:21.929
He promised to pay me back.

34:23.319 --> 34:24.524
And yet,

34:24.543 --> 34:26.498
he stole your father's watch.

34:27.155 --> 34:30.007
Risked selling it for 100,000 Euros.

34:30.661 --> 34:31.792
Why?

34:32.237 --> 34:33.597
Did he just get greedy?

34:35.136 --> 34:38.158
Romano noticed Papa's watch when
he came to visit me at the academy.

34:38.197 --> 34:40.286
He'd go on and on about it.

34:41.562 --> 34:43.447
That's clearly why he killed my father.

34:46.315 --> 34:47.516
Hmm.

34:48.601 --> 34:49.866
Sit tight.

34:57.396 --> 34:59.317
He's a judge's son.

34:59.605 --> 35:02.841
He knows that at best our
case is circumstantial.

35:02.922 --> 35:05.167
Even the prints on the
bills didn't phase him.

35:15.035 --> 35:16.092
Hey.

35:16.370 --> 35:17.516
Got your text.

35:17.566 --> 35:18.548
What did you find?

35:18.563 --> 35:20.921
I searched multiple databases.

35:21.414 --> 35:22.958
Nothing hit, but,

35:22.966 --> 35:24.523
then I found these.

35:26.677 --> 35:29.029
Hungarian police documents.

35:29.054 --> 35:31.485
They mention a medallion
just like the one you gave me.

35:31.491 --> 35:32.458
In what context?

35:32.468 --> 35:35.629
An organized kidnapping
ring was busted in Budapest.

35:35.679 --> 35:37.183
Hungarian Roma.

35:37.446 --> 35:39.923
They used this medallion as a token of...

35:40.236 --> 35:42.092
- membership.
- Who'd they kidnap?

35:42.122 --> 35:43.804
Western European children.

35:44.236 --> 35:46.077
Sold them on the black
market adoption network

35:46.092 --> 35:47.129
to Europe and the States.

35:47.149 --> 35:49.442
- This is from 1989.
- I know.

35:49.659 --> 35:51.958
- The trail's a bit cold.
- You think?

35:52.623 --> 35:54.871
Still, your sister could
have been one of them.

35:54.875 --> 35:57.084
She went missing in 1983, right?

35:59.128 --> 36:00.349
I'm sorry.

36:01.832 --> 36:03.505
I'm sorry there isn't more.

36:05.594 --> 36:07.014
No, it's OK.

36:11.708 --> 36:13.311
But you're gonna keep digging, right?

36:13.431 --> 36:14.680
I...

36:15.658 --> 36:18.194
I don't know how much more
there is to find, but...

36:18.765 --> 36:21.072
Yeah, sure, I'll try.

36:21.073 --> 36:22.273
You do that.

36:28.799 --> 36:30.025
Any luck?

36:30.864 --> 36:32.938
Well, the kid went to military school.

36:32.953 --> 36:34.958
He's used to being
pressurized and not budging.

36:35.261 --> 36:36.730
You're concerned?

36:39.087 --> 36:42.140
You can get him to
implicate himself, can't you?

36:44.983 --> 36:46.775
Let me take a crack at it.

37:16.853 --> 37:18.496
Let's talk about this.

37:21.329 --> 37:22.500
Were you there

37:22.744 --> 37:24.828
when they did this to your friend Romano?

37:27.011 --> 37:28.693
That must have hurt.

37:29.761 --> 37:31.085
Did he scream?

37:33.259 --> 37:34.529
While you were there

37:34.544 --> 37:36.028
you broke your collarbone.

37:36.078 --> 37:37.358
And a couple of ribs.

37:38.346 --> 37:40.385
You were in the infirmary for a week.

37:40.600 --> 37:42.138
That was an accident, was it?

37:42.530 --> 37:44.321
'Cause that's what he says here.

37:44.609 --> 37:46.475
Shit like that happened at Mazzini.

37:47.190 --> 37:48.565
It's no big deal.

37:50.451 --> 37:51.767
Some could take it.

37:51.831 --> 37:54.466
Some like Romano, couldn't.

37:55.593 --> 37:56.793
He cracked.

37:58.044 --> 37:59.592
Did your dad know?

38:00.520 --> 38:02.495
He said I should stick it out.

38:03.080 --> 38:04.951
Said if I couldn't I was weak.

38:06.306 --> 38:08.043
Well, maybe he was right.

38:09.254 --> 38:10.787
I mean...

38:11.437 --> 38:13.378
You watched your friend being abused

38:13.407 --> 38:15.805
and you just stood there and let it happen.

38:16.420 --> 38:18.272
Maybe you are just weak.

38:20.063 --> 38:21.731
You and your mum,

38:22.674 --> 38:24.395
you're close, right?

38:26.346 --> 38:29.304
Don't worry, you don't have to
say anything, I know the answer.

38:30.068 --> 38:32.852
I saw for myself when we
came to ask you questions.

38:34.188 --> 38:35.617
You were sweet with her.

38:36.521 --> 38:37.920
Protective.

38:39.131 --> 38:41.185
I... I used to be the same with my mum.

38:41.260 --> 38:44.079
I'll tell you something, it's a good
thing that she isn't alive today.

38:44.253 --> 38:46.803
'Cause she would not have know
what to do with an iPhone.

38:53.648 --> 38:55.837
See, I had to protect my mum.

38:57.579 --> 38:58.958
Is he playing him?

38:59.436 --> 39:00.984
- Not sure.
- My dad,

39:00.993 --> 39:02.318
he was a bad drinker,

39:02.333 --> 39:05.162
- and he had these fat knuckles...
- My father never beat me!

39:05.163 --> 39:06.297
I'm not saying that he did, mate.

39:06.323 --> 39:07.728
- He was a good man!
- Yeah.

39:07.738 --> 39:09.589
On good days, so was mine.

39:09.832 --> 39:12.209
He was charismatic as hell.

39:12.234 --> 39:15.335
But he had one face for the
world, and he had another at home.

39:16.045 --> 39:17.811
Now I'm just guessing, but,

39:18.739 --> 39:20.973
I think that your dad was cruel to you.

39:21.548 --> 39:23.017
Cruel to your mum.

39:25.509 --> 39:27.122
I can see it in her eyes.

39:29.206 --> 39:31.559
She got bashed about a bit too, didn't she?

39:32.030 --> 39:33.167
Your mum...

39:35.033 --> 39:36.884
dislocated shoulder,

39:38.011 --> 39:39.499
concussions,

39:39.544 --> 39:41.722
fractured jaw a couple years back.

39:41.965 --> 39:43.379
And then,

39:43.697 --> 39:45.156
three weeks ago,

39:45.211 --> 39:47.127
couple of broken ribs.

39:47.737 --> 39:49.668
The holiday that your dad took her on,

39:49.788 --> 39:51.762
was that his way of saying "sorry"?

39:53.510 --> 39:55.519
You're just the same as him, aren't you?

39:55.700 --> 39:57.078
Let her take the flak for this?

39:57.087 --> 39:58.462
My mother didn't do anything.

39:58.463 --> 40:00.968
Well, those bank notes that
we found at your Romano's flat,

40:00.969 --> 40:03.023
had your fingerprints on them, same as hers

40:03.033 --> 40:04.954
and the prosecutor might easily argue

40:04.959 --> 40:06.761
- that the two of you paid him together.
- She didn't!

40:07.145 --> 40:09.080
- She didn't hurt anyone!
- But you're gonna let her

40:09.085 --> 40:10.648
take the flak for this?

40:11.496 --> 40:13.469
Your dad was right, you are weak.

40:13.537 --> 40:14.791
But you can't!

40:14.797 --> 40:16.373
We're gonna have to bring
in your mum and charge her.

40:16.373 --> 40:17.936
You leave her out of this!

40:19.758 --> 40:21.935
I told Romano to do it!

40:23.133 --> 40:24.813
I wanted him dead!

40:27.482 --> 40:30.336
I told the bastard to
keep his hands off her!

40:30.676 --> 40:33.003
Then look what he fucking did!

40:33.071 --> 40:34.411
Look!

40:48.269 --> 40:49.469
You OK?

40:59.176 --> 41:00.677
Berger?

41:03.207 --> 41:05.240
You know that we could not use in court

41:05.252 --> 41:08.953
whatever you overheard today, but
you would continue to listen, yes?

41:09.073 --> 41:10.357
Yeah, sure.

41:10.373 --> 41:11.469
Good.

41:12.241 --> 41:13.979
You did good work today.

41:14.247 --> 41:15.860
I hope you'll tell Carine that.

41:18.152 --> 41:20.783
I know you think that
she is hard on you, but,

41:20.807 --> 41:22.872
she is equally hard on herself.

41:22.892 --> 41:23.864
I know that.

41:24.207 --> 41:26.383
She's always the last one
to leave the office at night.

41:26.384 --> 41:28.714
And the first one here in
the morning. What is this?

41:28.834 --> 41:30.083
Is this yours?

41:30.402 --> 41:31.920
That is

41:31.955 --> 41:33.717
some evidence Marco gave me.

41:36.636 --> 41:38.239
Pertaining to what?

41:39.892 --> 41:41.966
The man who abducted his sister.

41:42.974 --> 41:45.173
Does Carine know about this?

41:46.170 --> 41:47.699
Yeah, she does.

41:48.010 --> 41:49.210
She does?

41:50.539 --> 41:51.739
Thank you.

41:57.004 --> 41:58.081
Bene.

41:58.562 --> 42:01.867
Sono molto contento di questa notizia.

42:01.987 --> 42:03.163
Sì.

42:03.530 --> 42:04.815
Grazie.

42:04.935 --> 42:06.231
Arrivederla.

42:07.759 --> 42:09.894
- Rome?
- The prime minister's office.

42:09.914 --> 42:11.878
They are satisfied that the mafia

42:11.956 --> 42:14.666
had nothing to do with the judge's murder.

42:14.683 --> 42:17.398
We have effectively saved the work, and,

42:17.518 --> 42:19.135
quite possibly the lives

42:19.160 --> 42:21.552
of those agents embedded in Calabria.

42:21.959 --> 42:23.172
Good.

42:24.306 --> 42:28.256
Berger is looking into the
abduction of Costante's sister.

42:28.802 --> 42:30.191
You approved that?

42:30.266 --> 42:31.675
Yes, that's right.

42:31.789 --> 42:34.298
That's how you were
able to persuade Costante

42:34.299 --> 42:35.735
to join the unit?

42:39.705 --> 42:42.290
By promising him our assistance?

42:43.345 --> 42:44.545
I had to.

42:44.771 --> 42:46.166
He wouldn't have stayed otherwise.

42:46.181 --> 42:48.896
His sister was taken when he was a boy.

42:49.016 --> 42:52.017
He became a police officer
so that he could find her.

42:52.047 --> 42:54.255
- Yes, I know that.
- And did you know

42:54.280 --> 42:57.069
that after nearly thirty years of searching

42:57.074 --> 42:59.793
he finally located the
man that had taken her?

43:00.131 --> 43:01.406
He had him

43:01.430 --> 43:02.895
in his grasp.

43:03.192 --> 43:06.240
And the fellow put a pistol to
his head and blew his brains out.

43:06.279 --> 43:08.324
Told Costante nothing.

43:08.829 --> 43:12.294
And his refusal to give up
the search for his sister,

43:12.309 --> 43:14.483
lead to the breakup of his marriage,

43:14.731 --> 43:17.178
and that was just before he came to us.

43:19.252 --> 43:22.121
Why do I get the feeling that
you're angry with me, Michel?

43:23.188 --> 43:25.471
Carine, sit down, please.

43:27.968 --> 43:30.763
I have no idea if his sister is alive.

43:30.777 --> 43:32.862
But I do know and you know

43:33.388 --> 43:35.393
that the odds against it

43:35.513 --> 43:37.214
are overwhelming.

43:37.214 --> 43:39.893
You used this man's tragedy

43:40.396 --> 43:42.093
to lure him onto the team.

43:42.262 --> 43:43.696
That could cost you, Carine.

43:43.706 --> 43:45.041
It was his choice.

43:45.050 --> 43:46.281
- No, no.
- Not mine.

43:46.306 --> 43:48.355
Not true. You own it, Carine.

43:48.365 --> 43:49.641
Do you understand?

43:51.402 --> 43:54.247
You have given this man... new hope.

43:54.495 --> 43:57.769
And that can be a very cruel gift

43:58.345 --> 44:01.636
with devastating repercussions.

44:01.738 --> 44:03.767
Now it is down to you

44:04.455 --> 44:06.390
to find a solution.
