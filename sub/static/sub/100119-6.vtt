WEBVTT

00:09.600 --> 00:12.360
I can't believe he did this to me.

00:13.840 --> 00:17.520
I mean, I gave him my life.

00:18.800 --> 00:21.280
Your life?
Weren't you together, like, two days?

00:22.440 --> 00:25.600
Sure, but that was in physical days.

00:25.680 --> 00:28.640
Emotionally, I've been with him
for more than a year.

00:30.280 --> 00:32.360
"My heart is in a different place."

00:33.480 --> 00:35.080
Such a--

00:48.040 --> 00:48.880
[sniffs]

00:58.960 --> 01:00.080
Emma...

01:03.440 --> 01:06.120
Max, someone stole the magnetite.

01:09.080 --> 01:11.080
[theme music playing]

01:29.080 --> 01:30.080
How could you?

01:30.160 --> 01:32.640
-What?
-Is someone blackmailing you again?

01:32.720 --> 01:34.200
What are you talking about?

01:40.280 --> 01:42.880
What? Are you kidding? That...

01:43.800 --> 01:46.240
-That's fake.
-You're saying that isn't you?

01:47.320 --> 01:49.120
I'm saying I didn't do that.

01:49.200 --> 01:51.120
-Have you been lying to me all along?
-What?

01:51.200 --> 01:52.360
Is Leaf even real?

01:52.440 --> 01:55.240
No. I mean, yes, Leaf is real.

01:55.320 --> 01:57.320
But no to the other stuff.

02:03.120 --> 02:07.200
Look, there. When I'm holding
the magnetite, the vase is still there.

02:07.280 --> 02:08.160
So?

02:08.760 --> 02:12.960
So... I knocked over the vase
before we hung the magnetite up.

02:15.880 --> 02:18.720
Seriously, Max, why would I throw away
a piece of moon rock?

02:18.800 --> 02:21.160
Keep it for myself, sure,
but throw it away?

02:21.240 --> 02:23.240
Someone messed with this footage.

02:25.720 --> 02:28.240
Okay. I believe you.

02:30.360 --> 02:31.720
But who could do this?

02:33.120 --> 02:34.160
Who would do this?

02:34.240 --> 02:37.600
I don't know,
but whoever did it has the magnetite.

02:37.680 --> 02:38.880
We have to find them.

02:38.960 --> 02:42.800
Wait. If anyone else notices
the magnetite's gone, they'll tell Ryan.

02:42.880 --> 02:44.840
She'll see the footage
and think it was you.

02:44.920 --> 02:45.880
You're right.

02:47.360 --> 02:48.680
[stammering] What do we do?

02:50.360 --> 02:51.320
Got it.

02:51.400 --> 02:56.400
I need glue, polyurethane, silicon,
black ink and a 3D printer.

03:00.120 --> 03:04.160
Man, I'd rather lose by 20 points
than one.

03:04.240 --> 03:05.200
Really?

03:06.440 --> 03:07.680
Because I'd rather win!

03:08.920 --> 03:10.880
What the hell happened out there?

03:10.960 --> 03:11.800
[Daniel] It's my fault, Coach.

03:12.960 --> 03:14.280
I got that sixth foul.

03:15.720 --> 03:20.680
And you, you were completely unfocused
after the time-out. What happened?

03:21.440 --> 03:24.040
[sighs] So, this is how we greet
our new headmaster.

03:26.040 --> 03:27.560
What a shame.

03:45.400 --> 03:46.760
[Hayley] Hey.

03:46.840 --> 03:47.680
Hey.

03:49.080 --> 03:52.040
Um, excuse me. Get back here.

03:52.120 --> 03:55.040
I'm still your big sister
and I can still take you down.

04:03.360 --> 04:06.880
Hey, it's not your fault you lost.
You all screwed up.

04:08.800 --> 04:11.680
I'm actually talking
about my cheerleading skills.

04:11.760 --> 04:14.280
It's probably what made you miss the shot.

04:15.320 --> 04:17.680
Yeah, I wish that was the reason.

04:18.480 --> 04:20.800
During the time-out,
Brooke broke up with me.

04:20.880 --> 04:22.040
What?

04:22.120 --> 04:24.959
Except I don't think
she was hypnotized this time.

04:25.040 --> 04:28.240
I mean, why couldn't she wait until
the end of the game, like a normal person?

04:28.960 --> 04:30.680
You know, I always thought
that she was a little bit--

04:30.760 --> 04:31.880
Don't.

04:32.560 --> 04:33.480
Okay.

04:34.760 --> 04:36.760
Another time, when you're ready
to rag on her.

04:37.960 --> 04:39.840
Hey, you want to come with me
and visit Suzanne tonight

04:39.920 --> 04:41.080
and cheer her up at the hospital?

04:42.120 --> 04:43.240
I'll call Mom. She'll love it if you come.

04:43.960 --> 04:45.000
Wait...

04:46.160 --> 04:47.480
[sighs] Don't call her.

04:49.200 --> 04:51.600
You should've seen her face
when I missed that shot.

04:52.560 --> 04:53.760
Alex, come on.

04:54.920 --> 04:57.320
Moms don't care if you lose sometimes.

04:58.840 --> 04:59.680
She loves you.

05:01.320 --> 05:03.320
And by the way, so do sisters.

05:24.200 --> 05:25.640
Oh, my God, it's perfect.

05:25.720 --> 05:27.240
I know.

05:27.320 --> 05:28.760
When we find the real one,

05:28.840 --> 05:30.680
I'm taking this and putting it
in my room at home.

05:30.760 --> 05:33.000
Thank you so much for helping me.

05:33.080 --> 05:34.040
Anything for you.

05:37.800 --> 05:42.320
Max, you know how you asked me earlier
about Leaf being a lie?

05:43.080 --> 05:43.920
Well--

05:44.000 --> 05:48.160
I am so sorry I ever thought
you would lie to me. Even for a minute.

05:48.240 --> 05:49.640
I know you would never do that.

05:52.400 --> 05:53.440
Now, come on.

05:53.520 --> 05:55.400
Let's finish this and get it upstairs
before anyone notices.

05:55.480 --> 05:56.920
[both chuckle]

06:06.880 --> 06:07.960
[client] What's your problem?

06:09.360 --> 06:10.760
The magnetite's gone.

06:11.280 --> 06:12.560
What the hell?

06:13.960 --> 06:16.080
What's the situation with our insider?

06:21.160 --> 06:22.360
[sighs]

06:23.160 --> 06:24.800
Stupid kids.

06:26.200 --> 06:28.640
How'd you put up with them for so long?

06:40.720 --> 06:41.800
[cell phone ringing]

06:44.960 --> 06:46.200
Yeah, boss?

06:46.280 --> 06:47.520
You get paid?

06:48.240 --> 06:49.080
<i>Yeah.</i>

06:49.160 --> 06:53.880
-Then why aren't you here right now?
<i>-I'm just, uh... camping.</i>

06:54.520 --> 06:55.480
Taking a night off.

06:57.240 --> 07:02.320
-Am I paying you for a night off?
-No. I'll get back tonight.

07:03.360 --> 07:07.200
Listen, boss, the kid paid
with a solid gold plaque.

07:07.280 --> 07:08.440
<i>Better be real.</i>

07:09.440 --> 07:10.400
It is.

07:10.480 --> 07:12.960
-Be back in an hour.
<i>-Got it.</i>

07:30.720 --> 07:31.800
Damn it.

07:41.920 --> 07:43.440
[panting]

07:47.240 --> 07:49.280
[coughing]

07:55.800 --> 07:56.640
[Hayley] Come on, babe.

07:57.840 --> 07:59.680
It'd help you cheer up
by cheering someone else up.

08:00.440 --> 08:02.320
Come with me and see Suzanne. Please.

08:02.920 --> 08:07.800
Babe, I love the whole
cheerleading spirit, but not tonight.

08:09.120 --> 08:11.640
Good lord, men and balls.

08:11.720 --> 08:15.320
Look, I know you're probably
still upset with me...

08:17.000 --> 08:21.520
about what happened with your dad,
but I'm still your best friend.

08:22.280 --> 08:23.440
If you wanna talk.

08:25.320 --> 08:26.680
It's not about my dad.

08:27.760 --> 08:30.120
I mean, it is, but also...

08:30.200 --> 08:31.080
What?

08:32.640 --> 08:33.880
Alex and I broke up.

08:33.960 --> 08:34.880
What?

08:35.960 --> 08:37.440
[scoffs] That jerk.

08:38.600 --> 08:40.919
-[clicks tongue] I swear, I will--
-Soph...

08:41.480 --> 08:42.840
I broke up with him.

08:43.720 --> 08:44.600
Oh.

08:46.640 --> 08:51.840
Well, then he's a jerk
and he probably deserved it.

08:52.680 --> 08:53.960
Come here.

08:57.120 --> 08:59.000
[whispers] Oh, wait, look who walked in.

09:05.840 --> 09:07.240
[Parker] You know what, bro?

09:07.320 --> 09:09.560
I'm sick of your emotions
getting in the way of everything.

09:09.640 --> 09:10.960
[Daniel] Hey, bro, give him a break.

09:11.040 --> 09:14.160
-Even KD misses a free throw sometimes.
-Nah, D, not when it matters.

09:14.240 --> 09:15.560
-Oh, come on, Parker.
-What?

09:15.640 --> 09:16.480
-[Daniel] There was a lot going--
-No.

09:17.560 --> 09:19.160
No, he's right. I suck.

09:19.240 --> 09:22.200
No, you don't, Alex. It's not his fault.

09:22.280 --> 09:24.200
Yeah, all right, defend your brother.

09:24.280 --> 09:27.600
But if we're being honest here,
he's the reason we lost the game.

09:28.400 --> 09:30.160
Well, if we're going to be honest here,

09:30.240 --> 09:32.160
let's be honest
in whose fault it actually was.

09:32.240 --> 09:34.680
Hayley, don't.

09:37.080 --> 09:38.160
I'm out of here.

09:42.200 --> 09:45.040
While I'm gone, why don't you tell them
why Alex missed the shot, Brooke?

09:48.560 --> 09:49.840
What's she talking about?

09:55.280 --> 09:56.280
[Parker] Seriously?

09:56.360 --> 09:59.680
So, you dumped my man
right before his big shot?

09:59.760 --> 10:00.840
-That's cold.
-[Daniel scoffs]

10:00.920 --> 10:04.920
Guys, leave her alone, all right?
I missed the shot, it's on me.

10:05.000 --> 10:06.520
I can speak for myself.

10:07.760 --> 10:10.360
The world doesn't revolve
around Eagles games, you know.

10:10.440 --> 10:12.080
Yeah, well, it doesn't revolve
around you either, Brooke.

10:12.160 --> 10:15.160
I mean, seriously, you couldn't wait
two minutes to tell him?

10:15.240 --> 10:16.640
That wasn't cool, Brooke.

10:17.200 --> 10:18.120
You're an athlete.

10:18.200 --> 10:19.680
You know what something like that
can do to a person.

10:19.760 --> 10:21.640
[Brooke sighs] I can't believe this.

10:22.800 --> 10:24.840
I mean, do you guys hear yourselves?

10:24.920 --> 10:27.440
[sniffs] Instead of asking me
what happened,

10:27.520 --> 10:31.920
what he did, or how I'm doing,
all you care about is some stupid game.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.280
-Some friends you are.
-[Parker scoffs]

10:36.040 --> 10:38.240
Soph, back me up here.

10:39.960 --> 10:43.640
[sighs] Brooke, you know
I always have your back,

10:43.720 --> 10:46.600
but your timing was really off
on this one.

10:49.160 --> 10:53.520
[sniffs] Thanks a lot
for your support, bestie.

10:54.480 --> 10:57.640
Brooke, wait. Brooke, wait!

10:57.720 --> 11:01.360
-Brooke, wait. I wanna talk to you.
-[sighs] I'm done talking.

11:01.440 --> 11:02.760
Especially to you.

11:02.840 --> 11:04.280
Brooke, please.

11:04.360 --> 11:06.920
What was all of that
about us being best friends?

11:08.120 --> 11:12.080
I should have known better.
You've always been in it for yourself.

11:12.160 --> 11:14.920
No, that's not fair.
I was just being honest.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.480
Well, so am I.

11:17.200 --> 11:21.320
When I first met you,
you knew nothing about the Greenhouse.

11:22.640 --> 11:24.960
I taught you everything.

11:26.560 --> 11:29.280
-Brooke, I--
-You're not my friend.

11:37.480 --> 11:40.320
[breathing shakily]

11:46.080 --> 11:50.120
Hey, hey, hey...
No, no, no, no, no, it's okay. No.

11:54.600 --> 11:56.000
-Hey, there you are.
-[Suzanne] Ah!

11:56.080 --> 11:58.600
I had to ask three different nurses
where you were.

11:58.680 --> 12:00.880
These are sweet.
Thank you so much, Hayley.

12:00.960 --> 12:02.320
Of course.

12:03.760 --> 12:06.080
So, how are you?

12:06.160 --> 12:08.480
I mean, you gave us quite a scare.

12:08.560 --> 12:11.040
I know. I promise
I'll never blow up again.

12:11.120 --> 12:14.160
[chuckles] Uh, by the way,
do you want something?

12:14.240 --> 12:15.800
They said they were gonna close
the cafeteria soon.

12:15.880 --> 12:18.400
Oh, no, it's okay.
Leo went to get me a latte.

12:18.480 --> 12:20.520
Oh... Cruz is here?

12:21.160 --> 12:22.320
Yeah, you didn't know?

12:23.320 --> 12:25.600
You two must be on the same
psychic wavelength, then.

12:25.680 --> 12:27.320
[both chuckle]

12:30.280 --> 12:31.640
Woods.

12:32.680 --> 12:34.360
Didn't expect to see you here.

12:34.440 --> 12:36.080
Same goes here, Cruz. [sighs]

12:37.480 --> 12:38.320
Thank you.

12:45.000 --> 12:47.360
She's never gonna talk to me again,
is she?

12:47.440 --> 12:49.840
Hey, don't say that, all right?

12:49.920 --> 12:51.080
Of course she will.

12:52.240 --> 12:55.960
All you did was tell her the truth.
You always do.

12:56.040 --> 12:57.080
[Sophie sniffles]

12:58.360 --> 12:59.760
-[Enzo] Hey, guys.
-Hey.

12:59.840 --> 13:00.800
Eagles, right?

13:00.880 --> 13:03.680
-[Parker chuckles]
-Yeah. Eagles! Whoo!

13:06.120 --> 13:08.880
I mean, you gotta admit,
that guy is way cooler than Marcus.

13:10.920 --> 13:12.280
You're right about something.

13:14.080 --> 13:15.880
I do always tell the truth.

13:15.960 --> 13:16.800
You do.

13:17.480 --> 13:19.640
Parker, I have to tell you something.

13:19.720 --> 13:20.880
What's up?

13:20.960 --> 13:22.280
That guy... [scoffs]

13:25.000 --> 13:26.160
He's not cool.

13:27.320 --> 13:30.920
And he's not my friend, or yours.

13:32.240 --> 13:34.080
He's my ex-boyfriend.

13:46.080 --> 13:48.240
So, I have to get a new car.

13:48.320 --> 13:50.720
[chuckles] That's going to be fun.

13:50.800 --> 13:51.640
[Hayley chuckles]

13:52.720 --> 13:54.400
Hayley, how's it going with the Eagles?

13:55.320 --> 13:58.040
I have to say,
it was hard to get used to it at first.

13:58.120 --> 14:02.480
Uh... Yeah, yeah,
it was a bit weird at first,

14:02.560 --> 14:04.520
-but it's great now.
-[Suzanne] Mmm.

14:04.600 --> 14:07.360
Yeah, she's a really talented cheerleader.

14:07.440 --> 14:09.600
[chuckles] I never said I was good.

14:09.680 --> 14:12.640
[Suzanne] Well, what you are good at
is challenges.

14:12.720 --> 14:15.640
You did fantastic on the last one. Really.

14:15.720 --> 14:16.560
Thank you.

14:16.640 --> 14:19.120
[Leo] Pretty easy when you're a big fish
in a small pond,

14:19.200 --> 14:20.920
full of even smaller minds.

14:21.000 --> 14:22.800
[chuckles] Seriously?

14:22.880 --> 14:25.480
Well, if they have such, uh, small minds,

14:25.560 --> 14:28.160
why didn't you win the challenge
single-handedly, brainiac?

14:28.720 --> 14:32.120
Well, probably because his mind
was on other things.

14:32.720 --> 14:34.520
I heard you and Becca are now a couple?

14:34.600 --> 14:38.360
Oh, right.
How are you two lovebirds doing?

14:38.440 --> 14:40.280
Uh, we're not.

14:40.840 --> 14:42.000
We actually broke up.

14:42.080 --> 14:43.400
[both] Oh!

14:43.480 --> 14:46.760
What a shame.
I mean, she's such a delight.

14:46.840 --> 14:47.960
How could you give her up?

14:48.040 --> 14:50.840
Well, a lot of people
are in the wrong relationships.

14:51.640 --> 14:53.640
At least I can admit
when I make a mistake.

14:55.600 --> 14:56.480
[chuckles]

15:07.560 --> 15:09.400
[cell phone vibrating]

15:15.960 --> 15:16.840
Hello?

15:16.920 --> 15:19.120
Did you do something to my guy?

15:19.200 --> 15:20.560
What are you talking about?

15:20.640 --> 15:22.320
Don't play dumb with me.

15:22.400 --> 15:25.640
<i>He told me he got the gold plate from you</i>

15:25.720 --> 15:28.720
<i>and I keep calling</i>
<i>and he ain't picking up.</i>

15:28.800 --> 15:30.960
Really? Huh.

15:31.920 --> 15:35.280
Hey, did he mention anything else
besides the gold plate?

15:36.200 --> 15:38.240
Just about some stupid camping trip.

15:38.880 --> 15:40.800
<i>Are you in on this?</i>

15:41.400 --> 15:43.440
Do I need to come up there myself?

15:44.160 --> 15:47.600
No. No. I'll take care of it, okay?

15:48.400 --> 15:49.800
All right, I'll find him.

15:49.880 --> 15:51.520
So, let me get this straight.

15:53.000 --> 15:56.680
You let this guy blackmail you
into not saying anything?

15:56.760 --> 15:59.840
-Parker, you don't know him.
-No, Sophie, but I know you.

16:00.960 --> 16:03.240
You don't just back down from anybody.

16:03.320 --> 16:04.200
Parker, I...

16:04.280 --> 16:06.040
No, no, no, this is what we're gonna do.

16:06.120 --> 16:08.480
We're gonna go talk to Ryan right now
and get rid of him.

16:08.560 --> 16:10.880
Whatever he threatened you with
from your past doesn't matter.

16:10.960 --> 16:15.120
That's what you don't understand.
Parker, he didn't threaten me.

16:15.200 --> 16:16.240
So, what?

16:17.080 --> 16:18.160
He threatened you.

16:20.080 --> 16:20.920
Me?

16:22.400 --> 16:23.920
He said he would hurt you.

16:25.560 --> 16:26.640
Why me?

16:29.840 --> 16:32.760
[sighs] He found some photos of us
on my Louie.

16:32.840 --> 16:37.920
And he just got the wrong idea, I guess,
about who we are.

16:38.000 --> 16:39.920
[Parker breathing heavily]

16:42.320 --> 16:44.840
I'm gonna make that guy regret the day
he ever spoke to me.

16:44.920 --> 16:46.080
Parker...

16:47.440 --> 16:50.120
That's it! I know who took it!

16:50.760 --> 16:51.840
Who took what?

16:54.480 --> 16:56.640
Who cares? Life sucks.

16:59.400 --> 17:00.800
It was the groundskeeper who took it.

17:00.880 --> 17:03.320
Remember how impressed we were
when he hung up the magnetite?

17:04.280 --> 17:06.920
We were talking about how much money
it was worth.

17:07.000 --> 17:08.320
I don't think we should stereotype.

17:08.400 --> 17:10.400
Maybe he's independently wealthy
and doing this job for fun.

17:11.160 --> 17:13.480
Although he would have access
to the security cameras with that job.

17:13.560 --> 17:15.680
-Bring your laptop.
-Emma...

17:15.760 --> 17:18.240
-Bring your laptop!
-Where are you going? Emma!

17:19.280 --> 17:21.359
Emma, no, don't confront him.
He seems dangerous.

17:21.440 --> 17:23.000
I thought you were against stereotyping.

17:24.000 --> 17:25.720
-Do that--
-[all yelp]

17:27.040 --> 17:29.480
Whoa. What are you two doing here?

17:30.240 --> 17:32.040
Uh, nothing.

17:32.119 --> 17:35.200
We were just looking for a wrench.
Enzo is, like, a friend.

17:37.840 --> 17:40.880
Uh, Emma, I don't think
you should be friends with Enzo.

17:40.960 --> 17:42.080
Why not?
Why shouldn't she be friends with him?

17:42.160 --> 17:43.520
Do you know something?

17:44.480 --> 17:46.120
No. Why? Do you know something?

17:46.200 --> 17:47.760
No. We know nothing.

17:48.800 --> 17:50.000
Mmm-mmm.

17:50.080 --> 17:52.600
Okay, tell us what you know.

17:53.360 --> 17:54.440
-Now!
-Okay!

17:54.520 --> 17:55.880
All right. He stole something
from the Ravens.

17:56.440 --> 17:58.640
Stole what? One of your silly robots?

17:58.720 --> 18:01.960
Uh, how about a piece of moon rock
worth thousands and thousands of dollars?

18:02.560 --> 18:04.360
[both sigh]

18:04.440 --> 18:07.160
Yep. Sounds like Enzo.

18:08.320 --> 18:09.480
What do you mean?

18:14.320 --> 18:15.240
Hey.

18:20.040 --> 18:21.320
I'm sorry, Ryan.

18:22.000 --> 18:23.440
I can't take it anymore.

18:25.120 --> 18:28.760
Even... Even sitting here
with you is hard.

18:28.840 --> 18:29.960
I get it.

18:30.520 --> 18:34.120
I mean, this used to be your home,
and now I live here.

18:34.840 --> 18:36.200
I know how hard that must be.

18:36.960 --> 18:38.000
I just...

18:39.400 --> 18:40.640
don't fit in here anymore.

18:40.720 --> 18:43.120
Yeah, well, if you go somewhere else,

18:43.200 --> 18:45.400
you're gonna be a complete stranger
to everyone.

18:45.480 --> 18:47.520
At least I'll have a clean break
and a fresh start.

18:49.640 --> 18:51.680
I need to leave all of this stuff
behind me.

18:55.000 --> 18:59.000
What if we gave you
a fresh start right here?

18:59.960 --> 19:00.800
How?

19:02.080 --> 19:04.680
Well, I happen to know a clubhouse

19:04.760 --> 19:08.880
that could really use a sharp mind
and a strong voice right now.

19:12.520 --> 19:13.400
Wait, what?

19:14.320 --> 19:15.360
We saw him not that long ago.

19:15.440 --> 19:17.680
So, if he's run off,
he can't have gotten that far.

19:17.760 --> 19:20.880
I mean, don't you geniuses have
some kind of GPS that'll track scumbags?

19:20.960 --> 19:22.560
-[sighs] Parker.
-What?

19:23.920 --> 19:24.760
-Of course!
-Right!

19:24.840 --> 19:27.000
-That's it! Thanks.
-What?

19:27.080 --> 19:29.480
We know the magnetite emits
a sort of magnetic field, which would--

19:29.560 --> 19:30.960
Which would interfere with the GPS signal.

19:31.040 --> 19:32.720
If we can program navigational software

19:32.800 --> 19:36.120
that will pinpoint the exact location
of low or no signal, then...

19:36.200 --> 19:37.680
We can find out where the magnetite is!

19:38.480 --> 19:39.920
Took the words right out of my mouth.

19:40.000 --> 19:41.880
-Make sure you add the--
-Coordinates, yep.

19:41.960 --> 19:44.560
-And don't forget the--
-Triangulation algorithm. Of course.

19:44.640 --> 19:47.200
[chuckles] Wow, you guys
are pretty amazing together.

19:47.280 --> 19:48.120
No wonder you're dating.

19:48.200 --> 19:49.560
-What?
-We're not dating.

19:49.640 --> 19:53.280
God, I hope we find him.
I am going to wring his--

19:53.360 --> 19:54.480
There.

19:55.400 --> 19:56.760
He's in those woods near school.

19:56.840 --> 19:58.320
Let's go there now.

19:58.400 --> 20:01.120
He's a few miles away.
We'll never catch him.

20:05.760 --> 20:08.280
You guys in the mood to go for a ride
in the official Greenhouse van?

20:08.360 --> 20:11.240
-Oh, we can't do that.
-Right. That's stealing.

20:11.320 --> 20:16.560
[stammering] Uh, no. It's borrowing
for a really, really good cause.

20:19.440 --> 20:21.280
Okay. But I'm not driving.

20:21.360 --> 20:23.200
Hell no, you're not.

20:23.280 --> 20:24.760
Let's go. Come on.

20:27.080 --> 20:29.080
I'm just so glad to be back.

20:29.160 --> 20:30.080
Me, too.

20:31.880 --> 20:33.560
-Boom! Okay...
-Oh, he got you. [chuckles]

20:33.640 --> 20:35.840
-Ooh!
-Well played. Well played.

20:37.520 --> 20:38.680
[indistinct chatter]

20:50.200 --> 20:52.360
Hey, you okay?

20:53.400 --> 20:55.680
Yeah. I am now.

21:08.480 --> 21:10.400
[fire crackling]

21:20.320 --> 21:21.480
What the hell?

21:35.520 --> 21:37.360
Sneaky bastard.

22:01.880 --> 22:03.600
[GPS beeping]

22:06.240 --> 22:07.200
-Sophie.
-Yeah?

22:07.280 --> 22:09.920
With all due respect,
you're kind of a reckless driver.

22:10.000 --> 22:12.920
Max, with all due respect,
do you even know how to drive?

22:13.000 --> 22:14.200
-No.
-Then shut up!

22:29.440 --> 22:31.160
[coughing]

22:31.240 --> 22:32.960
[tires screeching]

22:36.720 --> 22:37.880
Ah!

22:43.080 --> 22:44.320
[coughing]

22:45.400 --> 22:46.760
[grunting]

22:51.480 --> 22:52.320
[crashes]

23:00.680 --> 23:02.240
[beeping]

23:02.320 --> 23:03.600
It stopped.

23:03.680 --> 23:05.280
-[Sophie] What stopped?
-The magnetite.

23:05.360 --> 23:06.360
Wait, so we're close?

23:06.440 --> 23:08.080
-[Sophie] What should I do?
-[GPS beeping rapidly]

23:08.160 --> 23:09.920
-Stop!
-[tires screech]

23:24.640 --> 23:26.400
I think she got it.

23:26.480 --> 23:28.360
-We did it!
-[all sigh]

23:29.040 --> 23:31.200
-Awesome.
-That is what I'm talking about.

23:31.280 --> 23:34.800
Now, let's get the hell out of here...
before we get caught.

23:34.880 --> 23:38.400
[chuckles] Max, you are bad.

23:38.480 --> 23:41.120
Okay, let's go, guys.

23:47.880 --> 23:50.360
-[tires screech]
-[all scream]

23:54.520 --> 23:56.520
["I Wait" playing]
