WEBVTT

00:01.710 --> 00:06.006
When I woke up this morning,
this was so not how I saw my day
turning out.

00:06.006 --> 00:08.842
[straining]
[passengers exclaiming]

00:08.842 --> 00:11.011
Should've been
a quiet afternoon.

00:11.011 --> 00:14.139
Meet with Gwen to pick up
the battery for my Horizon
Open House project.

00:14.139 --> 00:15.933
Maybe grab some hot cocoa.

00:15.933 --> 00:17.809
But instead, here I am.

00:17.809 --> 00:20.646
I'm used to things going wrong,
especially lately.
[laughing]

00:20.646 --> 00:24.274
Every costumed whacko
in the tristate area
seems to be after me.

00:24.274 --> 00:27.027
[laughing]
[straining]
But this guy?

00:27.027 --> 00:29.404
Couldn't he have
at least waited
until October 31st?

00:29.404 --> 00:33.867
[laughing]
Obliterating you is such
a thrill, Spider‐Clown.

00:33.867 --> 00:37.496
This is so boo‐tiful.
[laughs]

00:38.664 --> 00:41.083
More like boo
to that wordplay.

00:41.083 --> 00:43.085
[maniacal laughter]

00:43.085 --> 00:45.212
[stick blow lands]
Let me tell you,

00:45.212 --> 00:47.089
whoever this jack‐o'‐lantern
guy is,
[blows landing]

00:47.089 --> 00:50.175
he's definitely more trick
than treat.

01:01.937 --> 01:04.564
[laughs]
Hey‐ho!

01:04.564 --> 01:06.567
Who wants to gather round
the ol' campfire

01:06.567 --> 01:09.611
for roasted marshmallows
and spooky stories?

01:11.530 --> 01:14.283
Ugh! Who is is this creep?

01:14.283 --> 01:16.535
And where'd he get
all these dangerous toys?

01:16.535 --> 01:19.079
Hope you like it hot,
little spider.

01:19.079 --> 01:21.123
Pop, sizzle‐fizzle!

01:21.123 --> 01:23.125
Bat's all, folks!

01:23.125 --> 01:25.711
The cemetery is about to get
a new tenant.

01:25.711 --> 01:29.715
I used to think
Halloween was fun,
but you're out of your gourd.

01:29.715 --> 01:32.301
[creaking]
[passengers whimpering]

01:32.301 --> 01:33.802
[crackling]

01:35.470 --> 01:38.181
If I can use the weight
of the bus in my favor,

01:38.181 --> 01:39.808
I might be able
to pull this off.

01:39.808 --> 01:41.810
Gravity, don't fail me now!

01:41.810 --> 01:44.271
[laughs]
I deliver the Spider,

01:44.271 --> 01:47.149
I get the biggest
candy bag of all!

01:47.149 --> 01:49.026
Aah!

01:49.026 --> 01:51.653
[passengers yell]
[grunts]

01:53.822 --> 01:55.657
[grunts]
[both yell]

02:03.290 --> 02:06.585
Everyone, hang on!
Like we got a choice.

02:06.585 --> 02:08.670
[laughing]

02:08.670 --> 02:11.590
Ooh‐hoo‐hoo‐hoo‐hoo!

02:11.590 --> 02:16.094
Dangling spider...
with a bag full of goodies
to go splat.

02:16.094 --> 02:18.388
Should've designed
a Creep‐O‐Meter
for the open house.

02:18.388 --> 02:20.390
[grunting]

02:20.390 --> 02:23.602
This guy would measure
off the charts.
[grunting]

02:28.649 --> 02:31.151
Last stop, Brooklyn Bridge.

02:31.151 --> 02:34.154
Transfers to pedestrian walkways
are that‐a‐way.

02:34.154 --> 02:36.657
Thank you for flying
the Spidey skies.

02:36.657 --> 02:39.534
That isn't your
regular costume, is it?

02:39.534 --> 02:42.287
Because I think it's making
everyone uncomfortable.

02:42.287 --> 02:45.248
Look, I'm not happy
about it, either,

02:45.248 --> 02:47.209
but normally I don't
fight villains who attack me

02:47.209 --> 02:50.087
with industrial‐strength
itching powder bombs.

02:52.714 --> 02:55.342
[laughing]

02:55.342 --> 02:59.304
Jack is back to get
the Wicked Web of the West!

02:59.304 --> 03:00.430
[grunting]

03:02.349 --> 03:04.601
That doesn't
even make sense!

03:04.601 --> 03:07.604
Gotta lead him away
from these innocent bystanders.

03:07.604 --> 03:11.400
Come on, pumpkin head!
Let's see if you can
keep up with me.

03:11.400 --> 03:13.402
[maniacal laughter]

03:16.238 --> 03:20.575
Chills and thrills!
[laughs]
Ghosties and ghouls!

03:21.827 --> 03:24.204
This guy likes Halloween
way too much.

03:25.372 --> 03:27.791
That's a dangerous prop,
pumpkin‐man!

03:27.791 --> 03:32.337
I told you,
the name's Jack O'Lantern,

03:32.337 --> 03:34.631
King of Halloween!

03:34.631 --> 03:37.551
[grunts]
But you didn't tell me

03:37.551 --> 03:39.636
who put out the order
to take me down!

03:39.636 --> 03:44.850
I'll never reveal
the skeletons in my closet
on this special day.

03:44.850 --> 03:47.185
Today's not Halloween!

03:47.185 --> 03:50.230
Every day is Halloween!

03:51.356 --> 03:54.651
[singsongy voice]
Trick or treat?

03:54.651 --> 03:57.028
Yeah, not the time
for games.

03:57.028 --> 04:00.490
Don't you even
know the rules?

04:00.490 --> 04:03.201
[singsongy voice]
Trick or treat?

04:03.201 --> 04:06.288
Uh, okay. Treat?

04:06.288 --> 04:09.291
You got it!
[laughs, grunts]

04:10.500 --> 04:12.752
Not more of those things!
[grunts]

04:12.752 --> 04:14.337
[grunts]

04:15.881 --> 04:18.175
I knew caramel apples
were bad for your teeth,

04:18.175 --> 04:21.595
but, man, this hurts!
[yells, grunts]

04:21.595 --> 04:24.347
Bet ya can't catch me!

04:25.807 --> 04:28.310
Being taunted by a guy
with a pumpkin head.

04:28.310 --> 04:30.312
Could this day
get any weirder?

04:37.652 --> 04:39.821
Yes, this day
could get weirder.

04:39.821 --> 04:42.365
Gotta have a serious talk
with this guy.

04:42.365 --> 04:44.576
These fake webs
are just embarrassing.

04:47.162 --> 04:50.332
And this must be where he makes
all those explosive
caramel apples.

04:50.332 --> 04:54.377
Ten out of ten dentists
would agree
they are bad for your life.

04:54.377 --> 04:56.755
What is a dentist?
[laughs]

04:56.755 --> 04:58.924
Never heard
of such a thing.
[laughs]

04:58.924 --> 05:02.010
Oh, when I defeat

05:02.010 --> 05:04.429
and deliver you, spider,

05:04.429 --> 05:08.308
they'll give me a big,
[laughs]
big prize!

05:08.308 --> 05:12.813
Just think of how much
more spook‐tastic
I can make this place

05:12.813 --> 05:15.690
with all that sweet money.
[laughs]

05:15.690 --> 05:18.443
Are you incapable
of a clear answer?

05:18.443 --> 05:19.986
Who asked you
to deliver me?

05:19.986 --> 05:22.364
[singsongy voice]
I've got another treat.

05:22.364 --> 05:25.200
Another treat?
All you give out is tricks!

05:25.200 --> 05:27.202
Oh, no.
[laughs]

05:27.202 --> 05:29.579
This is a treat for me!
[laughs]

05:29.579 --> 05:30.705
Aah!

05:30.705 --> 05:34.167
[crying out]
Wait.

05:34.167 --> 05:35.669
Candy corn?

05:35.669 --> 05:37.254
[maniacal laughter]

05:37.254 --> 05:39.881
[grunting]
Ow! Stop!

05:39.881 --> 05:41.925
[groans]
Candy corn really is

05:41.925 --> 05:44.636
the worst candy ever!
[grunts]

05:47.889 --> 05:49.474
Oops.

05:49.474 --> 05:52.185
Now I'm helping him
produce those explosive apples.

05:52.185 --> 05:55.564
Hey! I'm in charge
of Halloween here!

05:55.564 --> 05:56.815
[grunts]

05:59.943 --> 06:03.697
Seek and hide?
My, my!

06:03.697 --> 06:06.449
Enough is enough!

06:06.449 --> 06:08.410
Who hired you,
Jack O' Lantern?

06:09.411 --> 06:12.831
Ghosts have real spirit!

06:12.831 --> 06:13.832
[laughs]

06:13.832 --> 06:16.459
Ugh! Is he even hearing me?

06:16.459 --> 06:19.004
Who put a bounty out for me?!

06:19.004 --> 06:21.590
That's witch‐ful thinking.

06:24.217 --> 06:26.261
How much
are you being paid?

06:26.261 --> 06:31.182
I only spook when spooken to!
[laughs]

06:31.182 --> 06:34.686
Oh, this guy's crazy
even by super‐villain standards.

06:35.979 --> 06:39.232
Maybe I need to play along.

06:39.232 --> 06:41.151
[grunts]

06:41.151 --> 06:44.571
Okay, Jack O'Lantern.
Your turn.

06:44.571 --> 06:47.157
Trick or treat?

06:47.157 --> 06:50.869
[laughs]
No one's ever asked me
that question.

06:50.869 --> 06:53.496
Delightful. I, uh...

06:53.496 --> 06:55.665
[breathing heavily]
Treat!

06:55.665 --> 06:57.417
[grunts]

06:58.376 --> 07:00.045
[grunts]

07:00.045 --> 07:02.297
[yelling]

07:09.554 --> 07:13.099
[Spider‐Man]
Congratulations. Now you're
a delicious treat, Jackie.

07:13.099 --> 07:15.185
[muffled yelling]

07:17.145 --> 07:19.606
[muffled laughing]

07:19.606 --> 07:21.524
[muffled yelling]
What's that?

07:21.524 --> 07:23.985
You realize it's not
actually Halloween?

07:23.985 --> 07:27.656
[muffled]
Nooooo!

07:27.656 --> 07:29.658
I agree.
We should only ever

07:29.658 --> 07:32.452
act like this once a year.
[muffled yell]

07:32.452 --> 07:35.580
Well, since it doesn't look like
I'll be getting any answers
from you,

07:35.580 --> 07:38.458
I'll just be calling the police
to shut down your little
fun factory here,

07:38.458 --> 07:41.336
and then I'm going home
to find my backup costume.

07:42.712 --> 07:46.466
Spider‐Man costume, that is,
not Halloween costume.

07:46.466 --> 07:50.053
Because a Halloween costume
this time of year
would just be weird.

07:50.053 --> 07:52.138
[muffled grunting]
[yawns]

07:54.974 --> 07:56.976
Running late. Again.
[gasps]

07:56.976 --> 07:59.813
And I've flaked
on Gwen already today.
[gasps]

07:59.813 --> 08:02.273
Not that this morning
was entirely my fault.

08:02.273 --> 08:05.527
That pumpkin‐headed maniac
wasn't exactly something
I had scheduled.

08:06.695 --> 08:07.737
[grunts]
Whoa!

08:07.737 --> 08:09.614
Ow!
[groans]

08:09.614 --> 08:12.200
Man, every muscle
in my body aches.

08:12.200 --> 08:14.869
Must have hurt myself
fighting Jack O'Lantern.

08:14.869 --> 08:17.747
Or it could've been
Overdrive, or Mysterio,

08:17.747 --> 08:20.125
or the Spot,
or that giant hippo

08:20.125 --> 08:22.085
creatively named "Hippo."

08:22.085 --> 08:24.295
[groans]
I'm really losing count
of the bumps, bruises,

08:24.295 --> 08:26.297
and costumed bad guys.

08:26.297 --> 08:28.758
[grunting]

08:28.758 --> 08:30.760
Focus, Peter.
You've got ten hours

08:30.760 --> 08:33.054
to finish your project
for the open house,

08:33.054 --> 08:35.390
and you need that
integrated battery
for the project,

08:35.390 --> 08:37.642
and you need to get
said battery from Gwen.

08:40.687 --> 08:44.649
Before she loses patience
and never speaks to you again.

08:50.989 --> 08:53.575
Huh. Being followed.

08:54.784 --> 08:57.912
Whoever you are,
I know you're out there.

08:57.912 --> 09:00.582
Let me guess.
Another bad guy
I've never heard of.

09:00.582 --> 09:02.625
[grunts]
We might as well
get this over with.

09:05.462 --> 09:09.716
Just testing to see
if this sixth sense
you're supposed to have is real.

09:15.805 --> 09:17.640
[high‐pitched ringing]
Aah!

09:17.640 --> 09:20.185
[groaning]

09:22.270 --> 09:23.730
Yah!

09:24.939 --> 09:26.357
Who are you?

09:26.357 --> 09:28.943
Just a guy with a job to do.

09:32.489 --> 09:36.159
[grunting]

09:36.159 --> 09:38.036
Amateur gadget party?

09:38.036 --> 09:41.122
Am I supposed
to be impressed?
[grunts]

09:41.122 --> 09:42.373
[grunts]

09:42.373 --> 09:44.751
[coughing]

09:44.751 --> 09:46.711
A smoke screen? Really?

09:46.711 --> 09:49.506
Okay, in terms of senses,
you've covered sight, sound‐‐

09:49.506 --> 09:52.217
And touch!
[grunts]

09:52.217 --> 09:54.469
[grunting]

09:54.469 --> 09:56.471
Please don't let there be smell.

10:04.854 --> 10:08.733
You know, it would be bad
for my superhero cred
to lose to Fog‐man.

10:08.733 --> 10:11.778
And this is coming from a guy
who almost got beat
by a panda‐person.

10:12.946 --> 10:15.323
The underworld
knows me as Prowler.

10:15.323 --> 10:18.576
Oh, good.
A villain who answers questions.

10:18.576 --> 10:21.704
Who sent you? I haven't gotten
a straight answer from anyone.

10:21.704 --> 10:23.164
Here's a straight answer.

10:23.164 --> 10:25.959
This is nothing personal,
just business.
[grunting]

10:25.959 --> 10:27.752
[yells]

10:27.752 --> 10:30.797
Let me tell you,
this is starting to feel
really personal.

10:31.631 --> 10:33.925
[grunting]

10:36.052 --> 10:40.181
[grunts]
Why won't these villains
just let me finish my homework?

10:41.266 --> 10:42.308
[grunting]

10:45.186 --> 10:46.604
[yelling]
[grunts]

10:46.604 --> 10:48.022
[grunts, groans]

10:48.022 --> 10:49.691
[grunts]

10:50.817 --> 10:52.360
[zapping]
No!

10:52.360 --> 10:53.862
What's wrong with this thing?
[beeping]

10:53.862 --> 10:55.864
Problem with your gear?

10:55.864 --> 10:57.907
That's not very
super‐villain of you.

10:57.907 --> 10:59.951
[beeps]
Finally.

11:01.035 --> 11:02.704
[both grunt]

11:02.704 --> 11:04.038
[grunts]

11:04.038 --> 11:06.040
[electricity arcing]
Cute trick.

11:06.040 --> 11:09.210
Can you blame a guy?
I thought I'd be lonely in here.

11:09.210 --> 11:11.671
You only made
this easier for me.
Huh?

11:11.671 --> 11:13.882
Don't get mad,
but if you're gonna do

11:13.882 --> 11:15.758
this bad‐guy thing
professionally,

11:15.758 --> 11:18.428
you've gotta take
better care of your gear.
[beeping]

11:18.428 --> 11:21.848
I'm just the muscle.
I can't fix this without my‐‐

11:21.848 --> 11:23.850
Without what?
My brother.

11:25.310 --> 11:28.646
He makes this gear.
I'm no scientist.

11:32.817 --> 11:34.569
Well, here's some science.

11:34.569 --> 11:38.281
Water plus electricity
equals bad news!

11:40.909 --> 11:42.327
Gotta insulate ourselves!

11:43.494 --> 11:44.787
Hold on!

11:44.787 --> 11:46.748
[grunting]
[electricity arcing]

11:46.748 --> 11:49.834
What are you doing?
Trying to keep us alive!

11:49.834 --> 11:53.463
[beeping]
Tell me you have a way
to shut this thing down!

11:53.463 --> 11:54.881
[straining]

11:54.881 --> 11:57.884
Aahh!
[yells]

11:57.884 --> 12:00.762
[Prowler grunts]
[Spider‐Man groans]

12:00.762 --> 12:05.558
Just... needed
a stupid battery pack.

12:05.558 --> 12:07.185
Why did you
do that?

12:07.185 --> 12:08.728
Save me?

12:08.728 --> 12:12.357
Uh, is this
a trick question?

12:12.357 --> 12:16.194
I attacked you.
Why would you save an enemy?

12:19.239 --> 12:22.825
Uh, it's kind of implied
in the "hero" part, you know,

12:22.825 --> 12:24.786
after the word "super."

12:24.786 --> 12:27.914
I can't take in someone
who just saved my life.

12:27.914 --> 12:29.791
Even a guy like me
lives by a code.

12:29.791 --> 12:31.834
So you have a moral code.

12:31.834 --> 12:33.836
Well, most villains don't.

12:33.836 --> 12:36.464
Maybe you're not as bad
as you think you are.

12:36.464 --> 12:38.800
Say, and now that we're not
beating each other up,

12:38.800 --> 12:40.802
any chance you can tell me
who put out a bounty

12:40.802 --> 12:42.971
for all these crazy villains
to take me down?

12:42.971 --> 12:44.973
I don't know.

12:44.973 --> 12:47.684
He was hidden in shadow.
Disguised his voice.

12:47.684 --> 12:49.811
Shadowy spider‐hater, huh?

12:49.811 --> 12:51.854
Let's see.
Osborn is gone,

12:51.854 --> 12:55.233
Doc Ock is in a coma,
I defeated Jackal...

12:55.233 --> 12:59.028
Well, I hope they offered
a lot of money, or I'm gonna
take that personally too.

12:59.028 --> 13:01.406
The paycheck
would've been good.

13:01.406 --> 13:03.908
But now I gotta find another way
to solve my problems.

13:03.908 --> 13:05.994
See ya around.

13:05.994 --> 13:09.539
Wait! You ever try
to get a real job?

13:09.539 --> 13:13.376
Like a non‐villain
who doesn't try
to cage superheroes?

13:13.376 --> 13:16.129
I got problems bigger
than you'd understand.

13:16.129 --> 13:19.882
I once had to cure
this entire city
of being spider‐monsters.

13:19.882 --> 13:21.801
I know problems.
Try me.

13:21.801 --> 13:24.971
[sighs]
It's my brother.

13:24.971 --> 13:27.056
The one who designs
all my tech.

13:27.056 --> 13:31.311
I botched a job,
and now he's being held
by someone... dangerous.

13:31.311 --> 13:34.564
If I don't pay up by tonight,
my brother's history.

13:34.564 --> 13:36.816
So, time for plan B.

13:39.027 --> 13:41.237
[coughing]
Ugh!

13:41.237 --> 13:43.990
Fog‐man sure knows how
to make an exit.

13:43.990 --> 13:45.241
[phone humming]

13:45.241 --> 13:47.368
Ugh! Gwen!

13:47.368 --> 13:49.996
"Pete, you're late,
and I can't wait around.

13:49.996 --> 13:52.040
Sorry. Heading back."

13:52.040 --> 13:54.959
Well, it looks like
I missed my deadline.

13:54.959 --> 13:58.546
That doesn't mean Prowler
should miss his.

14:14.604 --> 14:16.064
Miss me?

14:16.064 --> 14:17.774
What are you doing here?

14:17.774 --> 14:19.901
Just hanging around.

14:19.901 --> 14:23.071
Also, you seem like
the kind of guy that
doesn't like to ask for help.

14:23.071 --> 14:25.865
So I thought I'd volunteer.
Let me guess.

14:25.865 --> 14:28.159
Your plan B means
trying to sneak in
and free your brother.

14:28.159 --> 14:30.161
This is my problem.

14:30.161 --> 14:33.748
The guy holding him
isn't someone you want
to mess with, Spider‐Man.

14:36.292 --> 14:37.835
Are you trying
to give me advice?

14:37.835 --> 14:41.047
'Cause, trust me,
I'm terrible at taking advice.

14:42.048 --> 14:44.050
So who exactly
is this guy

14:44.050 --> 14:46.469
you don't think
I should meet?

14:46.469 --> 14:49.013
A Mob boss
named Silvermane.

14:49.013 --> 14:51.349
He's as powerful
as he is crazy.

15:00.608 --> 15:03.361
I knew I shouldn't have
worked for Silvermane

15:03.361 --> 15:05.196
but took the gig anyway.

15:05.196 --> 15:07.406
It came down to either
me taking out a guard

15:07.406 --> 15:08.950
or leaving
without the loot.

15:08.950 --> 15:10.910
So you left without it,

15:10.910 --> 15:13.121
and now Silvermane
figures you owe him.

15:13.121 --> 15:15.706
Something like that.
This way.

15:25.925 --> 15:28.427
Hobie!
What are you doing here?

15:28.427 --> 15:32.140
You're gonna get yourself‐‐
You brought Spider‐Man?!

15:32.140 --> 15:34.058
[snickers]
"Hobie"?

15:34.058 --> 15:35.893
[sighs]

15:35.893 --> 15:37.854
I prefer "Prowler."

15:37.854 --> 15:39.689
We gotta get outta here
before it's‐‐

15:39.689 --> 15:42.191
[Silvermane]
Too late, ya punks!

15:43.317 --> 15:45.027
[Spider‐Man]
Thugs with tommy guns?

15:45.027 --> 15:46.612
Holding someone's brother
for ransom?

15:46.612 --> 15:48.197
Old‐school gangster accents?

15:48.197 --> 15:51.033
Way to pull out the clichÃ©
bad‐guy moves, Silvermane.

15:51.033 --> 15:54.203
An interesting turn
of events, Prowler.

15:54.203 --> 15:56.455
I see you brought me
the Spider.

15:56.455 --> 15:59.542
It's not exactly
the cash you owe me,

15:59.542 --> 16:02.128
but the bounty
on this little insect's head

16:02.128 --> 16:04.881
is worth quite a bit.

16:04.881 --> 16:07.675
[chuckles]
I barely had to lift a finger.

16:07.675 --> 16:10.344
Spider‐Man followed me here
just to help and be a hero.

16:10.344 --> 16:12.180
Wait. This was a setup?

16:12.180 --> 16:13.931
Hmm.

16:13.931 --> 16:15.933
You might just prove useful

16:15.933 --> 16:19.145
to my organization
after all, Prowler.

16:19.145 --> 16:23.733
Finish Spider‐Man,
and I might forget your debt.

16:23.733 --> 16:25.776
Hobie? You can't!

16:27.236 --> 16:30.615
Don't do it. I can tell
you're better than this.

16:31.741 --> 16:32.992
Sorry.

16:36.412 --> 16:38.164
[both crying out]
[Silvermane]
What?!

16:39.540 --> 16:40.666
[groans]

16:40.666 --> 16:42.627
[grunts]
[yells]

16:42.627 --> 16:44.587
[grunts, groans]

16:44.587 --> 16:46.130
Aahh!

16:46.130 --> 16:50.218
Phew!
You had me going.
[weapon clatters]

16:50.218 --> 16:53.387
You're gonna pay for that.

17:02.563 --> 17:04.649
Did you know
that could happen?

17:04.649 --> 17:07.235
[bones crack]
Mm, guess so.

17:08.903 --> 17:11.280
[grunts]
[both yell]

17:13.074 --> 17:17.078
Why didn't you
tell me Silvermane
was a cyborg Mob monster?

17:17.078 --> 17:19.080
Don't know how that part
could've slipped my mind.

17:23.292 --> 17:25.127
[laughs]

17:25.127 --> 17:27.255
[yells]
Kicking a houseguest?

17:27.255 --> 17:30.091
[grunts]
Now, that is bad manners!

17:30.091 --> 17:32.426
[yelling]

17:32.426 --> 17:34.428
Please don't see me.
Please don't see me.

17:34.428 --> 17:36.639
[grunts]
Ah, he saw me!
[yelling]

17:36.639 --> 17:38.182
[grunts]
[yells]

17:38.182 --> 17:40.268
Oh, I'm fine.

17:43.187 --> 17:45.147
[grunts]

17:45.147 --> 17:47.108
Not fine!
[screams]

17:51.737 --> 17:52.780
Whoa!

17:58.536 --> 18:01.289
Abe, get outta here!
Call the police!

18:08.796 --> 18:11.465
Friends don't let friends
get blasted!

18:11.465 --> 18:15.261
Wha‐‐
Now take a time‐out and think
about what you've done.

18:15.261 --> 18:17.179
Little spider,

18:17.179 --> 18:20.057
I'm gonna have to
squash you myself

18:20.057 --> 18:22.059
and collect that bounty.

18:22.059 --> 18:24.061
[Spider‐Man]
How about a parting gift
instead?

18:24.061 --> 18:26.689
Like this, uh, coffee table!

18:26.689 --> 18:28.941
[yells]

18:31.652 --> 18:34.071
Maybe not.

18:41.203 --> 18:42.288
[yells]

18:42.288 --> 18:45.082
You picked the wrong day

18:45.082 --> 18:47.043
to start being a hero.

18:48.294 --> 18:51.631
[groans]
I need a strategy,

18:51.631 --> 18:54.467
but I'm too exhausted
to even think straight lately.

18:54.467 --> 18:57.595
Just like the fight
on the roof.

18:57.595 --> 18:59.263
Wait. The roof!

19:00.890 --> 19:03.768
[grunts]
[yells]

19:03.768 --> 19:06.187
[grunts]

19:11.609 --> 19:14.528
Prowler, do you have any more
of those doohickeys?

19:14.528 --> 19:16.322
You know, from the cage?

19:16.322 --> 19:18.074
Not enough to make
a complete cage.

19:19.158 --> 19:21.160
[grunts]

19:21.160 --> 19:22.662
We don't need one.

19:23.829 --> 19:25.748
Remember the science
I taught you?

19:25.748 --> 19:27.375
Got it!

19:31.545 --> 19:35.591
It's time I put an end
to this pathetic stunt,
Prowler.

19:35.591 --> 19:37.218
Wha‐‐

19:37.218 --> 19:39.136
Pillow fight!

19:39.136 --> 19:42.348
What? Everybody likes
a good pillow fight.

19:42.348 --> 19:44.058
[growls]

19:47.019 --> 19:49.188
[fire alarm blaring]
Prowler, now!

19:55.194 --> 19:58.197
[crying out]

19:58.197 --> 20:01.117
[screaming]

20:04.245 --> 20:05.246
[grunts]

20:05.246 --> 20:08.249
[groaning]

20:12.211 --> 20:15.381
You saved my life
more than once today.

20:15.381 --> 20:17.383
Not how I expected
this to turn out.

20:17.383 --> 20:20.594
Yeah. Neither of us
have had the day we expected.

20:20.594 --> 20:23.013
Thanks, Spider‐Man.

20:23.013 --> 20:25.182
No need. It's all
part of that whole

20:25.182 --> 20:29.270
super and hero thing
I keep trying
to explain to you.

20:29.270 --> 20:31.313
And for what it's worth,

20:31.313 --> 20:34.442
I think you make
a better hero than a thief.

20:34.442 --> 20:37.361
You did all right back there.
Both of you.

20:37.361 --> 20:39.697
Maybe something
to think about, huh?

20:41.282 --> 20:42.825
See ya around.

20:42.825 --> 20:45.453
Oh, and, Spider‐Man,

20:45.453 --> 20:47.455
you said something
about needing a battery.

20:47.455 --> 20:49.457
I did?

20:49.457 --> 20:52.418
You mumble when
you're barely conscious.

20:52.418 --> 20:55.713
[chuckles]
I mumble when I'm
completely conscious too.

20:55.713 --> 21:00.217
This is‐‐
This is an even better battery
than what I needed.

21:00.217 --> 21:02.094
It's yours.

21:02.094 --> 21:05.014
Okay, now you may have
just saved my life.

21:05.014 --> 21:07.308
Thank you.
No need.

21:07.308 --> 21:10.269
I hear it's all part
of that whole
superhero thing.

21:10.269 --> 21:13.189
That it is.

21:13.189 --> 21:15.941
Sorry to have to run,
but I have a science project
to finish.

21:15.941 --> 21:17.485
See ya, guys!
[web shooter deploys]

21:20.154 --> 21:23.073
Did he just say
"science project"?
