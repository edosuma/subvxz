You're facing your fears
with The Exorcist.

-In the name of God!

00:06.207 --> 00:08.042
Catch all-new episodes Fridays.

00:12.246 --> 00:14.548
I can make a difference, Alfred.
I know I can.

00:14.582 --> 00:15.916
Only on Fox.

00:18.886 --> 00:20.321
-Previously on The Exorcist...
-(demonic voice): She is going

00:20.354 --> 00:23.023
-to find you, you know. -What
about this group in Chicago?

00:23.057 --> 00:25.459
If we could get our hands
on a demon

00:25.493 --> 00:27.661
with that level
of influence and power...

00:27.695 --> 00:29.130
Hey, maybe God knows
where Caleb went.

00:29.163 --> 00:30.698
It doesn't work like that.

00:30.731 --> 00:32.566
What good is a god
that never shows up?

00:32.600 --> 00:36.204
-Is that guy a priest?
-SHELBY: I heard they both are.

00:36.237 --> 00:38.472
-Why are you guys here?
-TOMAS: I think

00:38.506 --> 00:39.673
there's something wrong.

00:39.707 --> 00:41.375
I feel it.

00:41.409 --> 00:43.144
-Aah!
-(screams)

00:43.177 --> 00:44.778
MARCUS:
There is work to do here.

00:44.812 --> 00:48.449
You sail? There's this
bird's nest on Jarrell Cove.

00:48.482 --> 00:50.818
-Strictly off-limits.
-Maybe some other time.

00:50.851 --> 00:54.021
-Do you think God led us here?
-He's not talking to me.

00:54.054 --> 00:56.390
-Well, maybe you're not
listening. -(short chuckle)

00:56.424 --> 00:58.392
GRACE:
We can be together forever.

00:58.426 --> 00:59.993
(Andy laughing)

01:00.027 --> 01:01.595
I'm really proud of you.

01:02.830 --> 01:04.432
Is somebody in here?

01:07.868 --> 01:09.870
*

01:17.445 --> 01:19.380
ANDY:
Grace, honey.

01:19.413 --> 01:21.315
I thought maybe we could
take a book outside.

01:21.349 --> 01:23.651
What do you think? Huh?

01:26.987 --> 01:28.989
What's wrong?

01:32.226 --> 01:34.228
-Verity?
-Who are you talking to?

01:43.737 --> 01:45.339
What-what are you doing up here?

01:45.373 --> 01:46.807
You go first.

01:46.840 --> 01:49.076
Who's Grace?

01:49.109 --> 01:51.044
What?

01:51.078 --> 01:52.613
What do you...

02:04.358 --> 02:06.460
Are you okay?

02:07.961 --> 02:09.597
Yeah.

02:09.630 --> 02:12.766
-Because this is...
seriously gross. -(fly buzzes)

02:25.346 --> 02:28.849
Is this, like, a Nikki thing?

02:30.884 --> 02:32.019
What do you think?

02:32.052 --> 02:33.821
I didn't mean to...

02:33.854 --> 02:36.123
Didn't mean what?

02:36.156 --> 02:38.959
I'm not allowed
to grieve for my wife?

02:38.992 --> 02:41.161
I'm not allowed to have
one place in this house

02:41.195 --> 02:42.363
that belongs to me?

02:43.664 --> 02:45.899
-Andy, I'm not...
-You're not what?

02:45.933 --> 02:48.035
You're not supposed to be here.

03:05.519 --> 03:07.187
(fly buzzing)

03:08.722 --> 03:10.724
(panting)

03:14.228 --> 03:16.530
-(fly buzzes)
-Aah!

03:16.564 --> 03:18.566
(groans)

03:26.173 --> 03:28.175
What is happening?

03:35.949 --> 03:37.951
No.

03:40.421 --> 03:41.855
No.

03:43.090 --> 03:44.292
No.

03:45.359 --> 03:49.029
No.

03:49.062 --> 03:51.198
Where are you going, Daddy?

03:51.231 --> 03:53.233
You're not real.

03:54.568 --> 03:56.770
You're not real.

04:02.175 --> 04:04.211
*

04:41.615 --> 04:42.883
You going somewhere?

04:42.916 --> 04:44.284
Oh, hey.

04:44.318 --> 04:46.320
I actually thought
it would be really fun

04:46.354 --> 04:48.589
if we all took an overnight
camping trip together,

04:48.622 --> 04:50.591
as a... as a family.

04:50.624 --> 04:52.092
-Camping?
-Yeah.

04:52.125 --> 04:54.495
-Really?
-Truck and Caleb-- they have...

04:54.528 --> 04:56.630
they got all this gear
last Christmas,

04:56.664 --> 04:58.298
and they've-they've been
begging me ever since, so...

04:58.332 --> 05:01.769
And-and tonight just seemed
to be the right time to do it?

05:01.802 --> 05:04.638
Yeah, I know it's sudden. Um...

05:04.672 --> 05:08.108
It's really sudden, but...

05:08.141 --> 05:10.911
The truth is...

05:10.944 --> 05:13.814
I asked Nicole to marry me...

05:13.847 --> 05:17.250
uh, 14 years ago... today.

05:17.284 --> 05:21.121
And, uh...

05:21.154 --> 05:22.356
You know you said this place

05:22.390 --> 05:24.358
is practically
a shrine to her, so...

05:25.426 --> 05:26.960
Okay.

05:26.994 --> 05:29.296
Uh, I get it.

05:29.329 --> 05:30.798
I do.

05:30.831 --> 05:34.234
But Harper-- she's barely
had a chance to settle.

05:34.267 --> 05:36.404
And I don't want
to disrupt that.

05:36.437 --> 05:38.271
I actually think it would be
really good for her

05:38.305 --> 05:40.307
to get out of the house
for a night.

05:44.712 --> 05:46.714
Good for all of us.

06:01.228 --> 06:02.630
You've got to be kidding me.

06:02.663 --> 06:06.333
Hi. Uh, I don't think we've met.

06:06.366 --> 06:07.801
My name is Father Tomas Ortega.

06:07.835 --> 06:09.703
I was hoping
to speak with Rose.

06:09.737 --> 06:11.204
Rose!

06:11.238 --> 06:12.740
Creepy annoying priest is back.

06:15.409 --> 06:17.377
Don't be rude.

06:17.411 --> 06:19.012
Father Tomas.

06:19.046 --> 06:20.280
This is a surprise.

06:20.313 --> 06:22.550
Is there somewhere
we can talk more privately?

06:26.754 --> 06:30.223
This may be a little bit hard
for you to hear.

06:30.257 --> 06:32.760
Especially after how we met.

06:34.628 --> 06:37.364
You know that
Marcus and I are...

06:37.397 --> 06:39.366
Exorcists.

06:40.868 --> 06:42.903
Our job--

06:42.936 --> 06:44.404
our calling--

06:44.438 --> 06:47.875
is to protect people, families,

06:47.908 --> 06:50.678
from the terrible evil
that preys on this world.

06:50.711 --> 06:53.413
Well, in my experience, people
don't need the Devil's help

06:53.447 --> 06:55.449
to be horrible to each other.

06:57.284 --> 06:59.820
What exactly are you getting at?

07:01.622 --> 07:03.290
(ghostly, whispering voices)

07:05.726 --> 07:07.728
(voices stop)

07:11.999 --> 07:14.602
Have-have you noticed
anything unusual?

07:16.069 --> 07:18.138
Anyone behaving
out of character?

07:19.840 --> 07:21.842
(car door closes)

07:24.311 --> 07:27.414
It's, uh...
it's hard for me to say.

07:27.447 --> 07:30.618
I've only spent a few days here.

07:30.651 --> 07:33.286
Maybe if I could
speak to some of the kids?

07:33.320 --> 07:35.956
I respect what you do, Father.

07:35.989 --> 07:38.759
They're strong,
but they are susceptible.

07:38.792 --> 07:41.729
-Yes, I-I understand...
-Particularly Harper.

07:41.762 --> 07:43.964
We just got done convincing her

07:43.997 --> 07:46.534
that demons don't exist.

07:46.567 --> 07:48.536
I can't let you
put her through that again.

07:48.569 --> 07:50.804
-This is completely different.
-I really appreciate

07:50.838 --> 07:52.673
everything you've done for her.

07:52.706 --> 07:54.975
I'm sorry. I...

07:55.008 --> 07:57.177
I really think
you should go now.

08:09.690 --> 08:10.924
Let me guess--

08:10.958 --> 08:12.593
thought about it
and nothing sounded better

08:12.626 --> 08:14.795
than seeing that nest?

08:14.828 --> 08:17.765
Uh, you seem to know
these islands pretty well.

08:17.798 --> 08:19.933
Anything unusual
spring to mind--

08:19.967 --> 08:22.603
um, historical oddities,

08:22.636 --> 08:24.371
violent crime?

08:26.874 --> 08:29.342
Bar fight violent, or, uh,

08:29.376 --> 08:31.311
Glenn Powell violent?

08:31.344 --> 08:33.346
Who's Glenn Powell?

08:33.380 --> 08:36.850
Back in the '50s, lived on, uh,
north side of Nachburn.

08:36.884 --> 08:39.319
A normal guy, good job.

08:39.352 --> 08:41.622
Then one day,

08:41.655 --> 08:44.324
for no reason at all,
kills his wife and kids.

08:44.357 --> 08:46.459
Except for his oldest daughter--

08:46.493 --> 08:49.129
she was at a slumber party
on the mainland.

08:49.162 --> 08:51.832
So, Glenn picks up
a length of chain,

08:51.865 --> 08:53.667
takes the ferry across the way,

08:53.701 --> 08:55.903
goes looking for his daughter.

08:55.936 --> 08:57.537
Kills everyone at the party.

08:57.571 --> 09:00.808
But the daughter crawled
into a cabinet and hid there

09:00.841 --> 09:02.876
while he tore the house apart.

09:02.910 --> 09:05.545
Till the cops showed up,

09:05.579 --> 09:07.715
shot ol' Glenn dead.

09:09.182 --> 09:11.051
Did she say why he did it?

09:12.586 --> 09:14.154
You can ask her.

09:14.187 --> 09:15.856
She lives across the bay.

09:15.889 --> 09:17.725
Hop on.

09:29.402 --> 09:31.404
Daddy, are you mad at me?

09:32.439 --> 09:34.775
No.

09:34.808 --> 09:36.844
Then why won't you look at me?

09:38.779 --> 09:40.914
Because I'm scared
you're not real.

09:42.950 --> 09:44.584
You're a silly Billy.

09:44.618 --> 09:46.386
I'm standing right here.

09:47.955 --> 09:49.389
I've always been here.

09:49.422 --> 09:51.191
Stop.

09:51.224 --> 09:53.894
Please.

09:53.927 --> 09:56.630
You should be careful, Daddy.

09:58.298 --> 09:59.466
(Andy groans)

10:04.337 --> 10:06.473
(groans)

10:20.754 --> 10:22.690
MARCUS:
If this is too difficult...

10:22.723 --> 10:24.692
ALICE:
Oh, I've spent my whole life

10:24.725 --> 10:26.960
talking about that day.

10:26.994 --> 10:30.063
60 years, three kids of my own,

10:30.097 --> 10:33.734
and I still remember it
like it was yesterday.

10:33.767 --> 10:35.703
Tell me about your dad.

10:35.736 --> 10:39.272
Oh, he was the best.

10:39.306 --> 10:44.644
Every night he'd come home
to tuck us in

10:44.678 --> 10:48.315
and he'd tell each one of us
girls something

10:48.348 --> 10:51.819
that-that he loved about us.

10:51.852 --> 10:56.156
And he didn't drink
or-or cuss none.

10:56.189 --> 10:58.792
He was kind.

10:58.826 --> 11:01.661
In every way.

11:01.695 --> 11:03.864
Why do you think he did it?

11:03.897 --> 11:07.267
I know my Daddy.

11:07.300 --> 11:10.103
That-that... that wasn't him.

11:10.137 --> 11:12.505
It was something...

11:12.539 --> 11:15.042
that looked like him.

11:17.510 --> 11:19.012
I believe you.

11:19.046 --> 11:22.716
One of the few
that actually does.

11:24.384 --> 11:27.020
I lost a lot of my friends,

11:27.054 --> 11:30.690
because I wouldn't
change my story.

11:32.025 --> 11:34.661
That's something I understand.

11:36.964 --> 11:40.400
What have you lost, Mr. Keane?

11:46.907 --> 11:49.676
(laughs): Clearly,
I lost my next question.

11:49.709 --> 11:53.046
Um... did your dad say anything?

11:53.080 --> 11:56.549
(whispers):
That's how I knew it wasn't him.

11:56.583 --> 11:58.551
The voice was all wrong.

11:58.585 --> 12:00.788
It was...

12:00.821 --> 12:03.190
dark and scratchy, like...

12:03.223 --> 12:05.893
like nails on a chalkboard.

12:05.926 --> 12:09.562
And he kept speaking in
a language I never heard before.

12:09.596 --> 12:11.398
Did he know any other languages?

12:11.431 --> 12:14.334
He barely finished eighth grade.

12:16.369 --> 12:18.371
That wasn't him talking,

12:18.405 --> 12:22.009
it was...
that thing inside of him.

12:22.042 --> 12:24.978
Wearing him
like some cheap suit.

12:29.116 --> 12:31.952
Kids, come on! Let's go!

12:31.985 --> 12:34.721
This is stupid.
Why are we doing this?

12:34.754 --> 12:36.723
Because we've all been
under a lot of stress,

12:36.756 --> 12:39.026
and it'll be nice
to do something fun together,

12:39.059 --> 12:40.627
as a family.

12:41.795 --> 12:44.031
Like get Lyme disease?

12:44.064 --> 12:45.398
Exactly.

12:45.432 --> 12:47.534
Hey. Did someone say s'mores?

12:47.567 --> 12:48.802
S'mores!

12:48.836 --> 12:50.570
(chuckles):
All right, there you go.

12:50.603 --> 12:52.272
-Here you go, pal.
-Thanks.

12:52.305 --> 12:53.807
Shelby.

12:55.308 --> 12:58.278
There's my fearless explorer.

12:58.311 --> 13:01.648
Um, Caleb said that there's...

13:01.681 --> 13:03.550
bears on the island.

13:03.583 --> 13:04.952
Starving bears.

13:04.985 --> 13:07.254
(chuckles):
There's no bears.

13:07.287 --> 13:09.489
Well, not unless they
figured out how boats work.

13:09.522 --> 13:12.292
(laughs)
See? I told you.

13:12.325 --> 13:15.128
You do know bears swim, right?

13:15.162 --> 13:18.465
Oh, I know that. There's
a lot of bears on this island.

13:18.498 --> 13:20.633
-(laughs)
-Wait. Uh...

13:29.742 --> 13:31.311
No.

13:33.847 --> 13:35.482
No.

13:39.853 --> 13:43.323
-Glenn Powell lived
on this island? -MARCUS: Yeah.

13:43.356 --> 13:46.326
And the story's got
all the hallmarks of possession.

13:46.359 --> 13:49.129
Could the demon still be here
50 years later?

13:49.162 --> 13:51.298
I don't know.
Not in my experience.

13:51.331 --> 13:53.934
(sighs) I should go back and
try again with the Kim family.

13:53.967 --> 13:55.668
And tell them what?
That 50 years ago

13:55.702 --> 13:57.504
a demon killed a family
on the island?

13:57.537 --> 13:59.339
Look, your visions
brought us here.

13:59.372 --> 14:00.773
I believe you.

14:00.807 --> 14:02.742
But we need confirmation.

14:02.775 --> 14:05.012
We'll go together,
in the daylight, tomorrow.

14:05.045 --> 14:07.747
What if they're in danger?
What if we can help them?

14:07.780 --> 14:09.749
If we go pounding on their door
in the middle of the night

14:09.782 --> 14:11.684
with some crazy-ass story, we're
gonna scare them off for good.

14:11.718 --> 14:13.786
Are we clear?

14:13.820 --> 14:16.323
*

14:16.356 --> 14:17.857
Clear.

14:37.978 --> 14:40.347
(reciting in Latin)

14:41.581 --> 14:43.383
-Amen.
-Amen.

14:43.416 --> 14:45.986
We don't want to miss the plane.

14:46.019 --> 14:47.487
(continues in Latin)

14:47.520 --> 14:49.556
Bennett, if we don't leave now,

14:49.589 --> 14:51.891
your friends in the Church
will find us.

14:51.925 --> 14:54.161
(continues in Latin)

14:54.194 --> 14:57.230
Our only chance is
to take the fight to them.

14:57.264 --> 14:59.933
Amen. And what about Dolores?

15:01.134 --> 15:04.404
You're praying
over a dead woman.

15:04.437 --> 15:06.006
She's already integrated.

15:06.039 --> 15:08.241
Father Tomas
brought a woman back

15:08.275 --> 15:09.609
from the brink of integration.

15:09.642 --> 15:11.411
A woman who
had been possessed before,

15:11.444 --> 15:14.381
who'd already gone through Hell
and come out the other side.

15:14.414 --> 15:16.516
Perhaps... she was stronger

15:16.549 --> 15:18.651
because she learned
how to fight.

15:19.953 --> 15:22.289
We can't take Dolores with us.

15:22.322 --> 15:25.058
So would you rather
set her loose on the streets,

15:25.092 --> 15:27.194
or leave her to starve
like a chained dog?

15:27.227 --> 15:28.795
(growls)

15:28.828 --> 15:32.432
I need to know
that when the time comes,

15:32.465 --> 15:35.268
you're capable of doing
what needs to be done.

15:37.470 --> 15:38.605
Devin...

15:38.638 --> 15:40.273
please...

15:40.307 --> 15:43.776
-Dolores.
-It's me.

15:43.810 --> 15:46.913
I'm still in here, fighting.

15:46.946 --> 15:48.515
Prove it.

15:48.548 --> 15:49.949
It's not Dolores.

15:49.983 --> 15:51.751
You told me

15:51.784 --> 15:54.421
if ever I need help,

15:54.454 --> 15:57.324
you would come for me.

15:57.357 --> 16:00.327
And, Devin, I need you.

16:00.360 --> 16:02.762
If I stay,
put everything I have,

16:02.795 --> 16:05.132
everything I am into saving you,

16:05.165 --> 16:07.134
the innocent will suffer,

16:07.167 --> 16:09.436
countless people will die.

16:09.469 --> 16:12.505
But what about me?

16:14.541 --> 16:16.243
Thank you.

16:17.877 --> 16:19.812
The real Dolores
would never put herself

16:19.846 --> 16:23.216
before the lives of others.

16:23.250 --> 16:25.052
(screeching)

16:25.085 --> 16:26.686
(grunts)

16:30.323 --> 16:32.659
You were the best of us.

16:32.692 --> 16:34.327
You don't deserve this.

16:34.361 --> 16:36.529
Devs peccata dimmitt.

16:36.563 --> 16:37.897
Non ego.

16:42.402 --> 16:44.637
(screeching)

16:48.375 --> 16:50.377
(roaring)

16:54.847 --> 16:58.851
It's time to pay a visit to
this Chicago monster of yours.

17:00.253 --> 17:03.290
(birds hooting,
insects chittering)

17:06.959 --> 17:10.563
(bird hooting)

17:11.998 --> 17:14.033
Son of a bitch.

17:14.067 --> 17:16.703
(Harper snickers)

17:16.736 --> 17:18.971
(sniffs)
Mine's perfect.

17:19.005 --> 17:21.341
(mocking):
Mine's perfect.

17:22.509 --> 17:24.544
How do you know when it's done?

17:24.577 --> 17:26.479
It's all about the smell.

17:26.513 --> 17:28.848
You got to get
the consummate level...

17:28.881 --> 17:30.317
of toast.

17:30.350 --> 17:31.818
Make one for me.

17:31.851 --> 17:33.286
Five dollars.

17:35.722 --> 17:37.757
So, how many of those
have you eaten?

17:37.790 --> 17:39.159
Only two.

17:39.192 --> 17:41.361
(quietly):
But Truck's had, like, 17.

17:41.394 --> 17:42.529
(gasps softly)

17:42.562 --> 17:44.631
(whispers):
Darn it. He beat me by three.

17:44.664 --> 17:45.765
(Harper chuckles)

17:45.798 --> 17:47.834
*

17:50.870 --> 17:53.072
Am I gonna get to stay?

17:53.106 --> 17:56.543
Well, right now it's
just a temporary assignment

17:56.576 --> 17:59.546
until we could figure out
the best place for you.

18:01.548 --> 18:04.151
Would you want to stay?

18:06.986 --> 18:09.689
Yeah. I like it here.

18:09.722 --> 18:11.124
Yeah?

18:14.427 --> 18:16.296
Me, too.

18:17.630 --> 18:19.632
(crickets chirping)

18:30.810 --> 18:32.845
GRACE:
Come home, Daddy.

18:32.879 --> 18:34.681
(panting quietly)

18:34.714 --> 18:36.683
Let me go.

18:37.884 --> 18:39.852
(footsteps crunching)

18:43.923 --> 18:45.292
The house is scary.

18:45.325 --> 18:47.059
You need to come home.

18:47.093 --> 18:49.028
I'll be good, I promise.

18:49.061 --> 18:51.097
Stop it.

18:53.166 --> 18:54.967
Stop it.
I know what you are.

18:55.001 --> 18:56.903
You're a s-stress-related
delusion.

18:56.936 --> 19:00.072
You're-you're a mental break.
You leave me alone.

19:00.106 --> 19:02.442
Go. Go! Go!

19:02.475 --> 19:03.976
I...

19:04.010 --> 19:05.978
want you...

19:06.012 --> 19:08.481
to come home.

19:08.515 --> 19:10.149
ROSE:
Andy.

19:10.183 --> 19:13.186
Andy, this is looking great.

19:13.220 --> 19:15.154
You have to see Harper,
by the way.

19:15.188 --> 19:17.056
She is loving this.

19:17.089 --> 19:19.025
Andy.

19:19.058 --> 19:21.060
-Are you okay?
-(sighs)

19:21.093 --> 19:22.995
There's something wrong
with me, Rose.

19:23.029 --> 19:24.264
What?

19:24.297 --> 19:26.499
Ever since Nikki died, I...

19:26.533 --> 19:29.702
I haven't been
a hundred percent.

19:29.736 --> 19:31.070
Andy...

19:31.103 --> 19:32.505
(sighs):
I tried...

19:32.539 --> 19:35.842
I tried so hard
to pretend everything was...

19:35.875 --> 19:38.511
okay, because the kids
needed it.

19:38.545 --> 19:40.580
I needed it.

19:41.714 --> 19:43.550
But I'm not okay.

19:45.552 --> 19:47.320
Come here.

19:48.688 --> 19:50.156
(Andy sighs)

19:50.189 --> 19:51.858
Listen to me.

19:51.891 --> 19:53.360
What you went through,

19:53.393 --> 19:55.962
what you're still going through,

19:55.995 --> 19:58.831
you're allowed to grieve,
you're supposed to grieve.

19:58.865 --> 20:00.367
(whispers):
No.

20:00.400 --> 20:03.035
I think I'm losing my mind.

20:03.069 --> 20:06.105
You don't have to be perfect.

20:06.138 --> 20:08.375
You can just be here...

20:08.408 --> 20:10.410
with us.

20:12.312 --> 20:14.146
Come here.

20:15.181 --> 20:18.851
You know you can tell me
anything, right?

20:27.427 --> 20:29.529
(softly):
Come here.

20:31.864 --> 20:33.400
Rose...

20:33.433 --> 20:36.403
I think I'm seeing...
(groans)

20:36.436 --> 20:38.471
What?

20:38.505 --> 20:40.940
It's a... bugbite.

20:42.509 --> 20:45.077
-Hey, you should go check up
on the kids, yeah? -Yeah.

20:45.111 --> 20:47.213
-I'll be there in a minute.
Let me just finish up. -Yeah,

20:47.246 --> 20:49.816
but... I meant what I said.

20:49.849 --> 20:51.718
Thank you.

20:51.751 --> 20:53.753
ROSE (softly):
Okay. Okay.

21:04.797 --> 21:07.800
-*
-(voices muted)

21:09.869 --> 21:12.138
(ghostly, whispering voices)

21:20.980 --> 21:22.982
(exhales)

21:25.217 --> 21:27.554
Hello?

21:27.587 --> 21:29.589
(quietly):
Anybody home?

21:38.765 --> 21:41.501
-(creaking)
-Hello?

21:47.039 --> 21:48.575
Rose?

21:48.608 --> 21:50.710
(ghostly, whispering voices)

21:56.483 --> 21:57.817
(Tomas exhales)

21:57.850 --> 22:00.319
(roaring)

22:06.158 --> 22:07.694
(bird calling in distance)

22:14.701 --> 22:16.636
(engine turns off)

22:16.669 --> 22:18.671
What are you doing?

22:18.705 --> 22:21.908
Well...

22:21.941 --> 22:25.144
you're the, uh, ex-priest

22:25.177 --> 22:28.014
who's looking
for something he's lost, right?

22:28.047 --> 22:30.917
You strike me
as the sort of person

22:30.950 --> 22:33.319
who's not exactly...

22:33.352 --> 22:37.390
comfortable sitting quietly
with his own thoughts.

22:38.425 --> 22:40.259
And?

22:40.292 --> 22:41.694
And...

22:41.728 --> 22:43.563
I was the same way.

22:45.698 --> 22:48.501
I did two tours in Kosovo,

22:48.535 --> 22:50.670
came back.

22:50.703 --> 22:52.739
(chuckles)

22:52.772 --> 22:55.675
Felt like my brain was on fire,

22:55.708 --> 22:58.945
like I wanted
to rip off my skin.

22:58.978 --> 23:02.915
-Like you'll never be still.
-Yeah.

23:02.949 --> 23:05.217
Yeah.

23:08.588 --> 23:11.257
(sniffs)

23:11.290 --> 23:13.292
There was a kid in the rubble.

23:15.595 --> 23:17.930
We were, uh...

23:17.964 --> 23:21.901
clearing out this neighborhood
in Uro.evac.

23:21.934 --> 23:23.636
It was all bombed to hell.

23:23.670 --> 23:25.371
I was scrambling
up this embankment.

23:25.404 --> 23:27.540
I put my hand down
on something soft,

23:27.574 --> 23:29.609
and I look down.

23:34.947 --> 23:37.283
I saw that kid every day

23:37.316 --> 23:40.419
for the next two years.

23:40.453 --> 23:43.590
In the morning,
I'd wake up, he'd be...

23:43.623 --> 23:45.625
looking down on me.

23:50.530 --> 23:53.399
What about you, Marcus?

23:55.468 --> 23:57.136
What do you see?

24:01.941 --> 24:03.976
You want to know
what's in my head?

24:06.613 --> 24:09.616
Arguing.

24:09.649 --> 24:11.784
Mum and Dad barking
at each other like dogs,

24:11.818 --> 24:13.920
both of them drunk.

24:13.953 --> 24:16.422
He's swinging a hammer,
she's in a ball on the floor,

24:16.455 --> 24:20.326
trying to scoop her brains
back in with both her hands.

24:21.994 --> 24:24.463
I'm yelling at him to stop,
but he cracks her again.

24:26.332 --> 24:28.000
And now, now there's blood

24:28.034 --> 24:29.636
coming out of her mouth
like a fountain.

24:29.669 --> 24:33.372
I'm seven years old.

24:33.405 --> 24:35.975
I pull his poaching rifle
off the back of the door,

24:36.008 --> 24:38.645
and I shoot a bullet right
in the middle of his throat,

24:38.678 --> 24:41.480
and even as he's going down,
his big, bloody hands

24:41.514 --> 24:43.315
are trying to squeeze
the life out of me.

24:43.349 --> 24:45.652
That's for starters.

24:45.685 --> 24:48.220
I see this little, unwanted boy
stuck halfway up an oak tree.

24:48.254 --> 24:50.322
All the other orphan bastards
are trying to knock him down

24:50.356 --> 24:52.659
with bricks and bottles

24:52.692 --> 24:54.193
to send him back
to the infirmary

24:54.226 --> 24:55.828
so he can spend another night

24:55.862 --> 24:57.664
cutting patterns into his arms

24:57.697 --> 24:59.165
to send himself to sleep.

24:59.198 --> 25:01.834
I see this little boy in...

25:01.868 --> 25:04.003
Mexico City.

25:04.036 --> 25:06.005
His neck is twisted
all the way around,

25:06.038 --> 25:08.975
and his mom is screaming at me
from the doorway.

25:09.008 --> 25:10.877
I see a housewife in Seattle

25:10.910 --> 25:12.979
mixing bleach with tap water

25:13.012 --> 25:15.014
and telling her little girl
that the water is holy

25:15.047 --> 25:16.849
so it burns her
when it hits her skin.

25:16.883 --> 25:19.385
That is what I see
when I close my eyes!

25:28.227 --> 25:31.530
(inhales, exhales deeply)

25:41.207 --> 25:42.742
(sniffles)

25:54.453 --> 25:56.455
*

26:16.609 --> 26:18.611
(ghostly, whispering voices)

26:23.082 --> 26:25.952
(door creaks)

26:40.299 --> 26:42.134
(ghostly, whispering voices)

26:50.442 --> 26:52.444
(Morty chirping)

27:00.219 --> 27:02.722
(chirping continues)

27:12.732 --> 27:14.500
(distorted warbling)

27:20.339 --> 27:22.341
(praying in Spanish)

27:38.357 --> 27:40.860
And that is why every Halloween,

27:40.893 --> 27:43.963
the Island Witch
crawls out of her well

27:43.996 --> 27:47.233
-and searches for more children
to steal. -(twig snaps)

27:47.266 --> 27:49.168
Seriously, what is your deal?

27:49.201 --> 27:51.603
-HARPER: Why is she in a well?
-CALEB: She lives there.

27:51.637 --> 27:53.205
HARPER: You said she
puts bodies in there.

27:53.239 --> 27:58.144
Have you noticed anything weird
happening around the house?

27:58.177 --> 28:01.147
Weird like what?

28:01.180 --> 28:04.917
Like, supernatural weird.

28:04.951 --> 28:07.519
(chuckles) "Supernatural"?

28:07.553 --> 28:09.655
Dude, you have got to stop

28:09.688 --> 28:12.024
hanging around
those dumbass priests.

28:12.058 --> 28:14.026
Right, right,
because religion sucks

28:14.060 --> 28:16.062
and everyone's an idiot.

28:17.563 --> 28:19.531
You know, V,

28:19.565 --> 28:22.534
some people actually just want
to help other people.

28:22.568 --> 28:24.804
Like the counselors at my camp?

28:24.837 --> 28:27.173
They couldn't wait

28:27.206 --> 28:30.542
to help me pray the gay away.

28:30.576 --> 28:34.513
That's why they
strapped me to a bed.

28:34.546 --> 28:38.117
Sprayed me with freezing water.

28:38.150 --> 28:42.922
Told me I was an abomination
in the eyes of your awesome God.

28:44.991 --> 28:47.626
-To help.
-Hey.

28:47.659 --> 28:50.930
I'm sorry
for what they did to you.

28:50.963 --> 28:54.066
-But they were misguided.
-(chuckles)

28:54.100 --> 28:56.668
I'm so glad I tried
to take my life three times

28:56.702 --> 28:58.670
because they were so misguided.

28:58.704 --> 29:00.572
Hey, no, not misguided.

29:00.606 --> 29:02.574
Evil.

29:02.608 --> 29:05.244
But they didn't work for God.

29:05.277 --> 29:07.246
They work for the other guy.

29:07.279 --> 29:09.248
Like there's even a difference.

29:09.281 --> 29:10.850
-Like you even have
the slightest... -No.

29:10.883 --> 29:12.985
I know more than...
I know more than you think.

29:13.019 --> 29:15.754
Oh, what, 'cause you read
a sad Bible story?

29:15.788 --> 29:18.424
I was 2.4 pounds

29:18.457 --> 29:20.492
when I was born.

29:20.526 --> 29:24.096
Methadone all in my system.

29:24.130 --> 29:26.966
It was my first birthday present
from my mom.

29:27.967 --> 29:31.437
And right now, every one...

29:31.470 --> 29:36.242
every one of my brothers
and sisters is dead.

29:36.275 --> 29:38.978
Except me.

29:39.011 --> 29:42.781
'Cause I found something
to hold onto.

29:42.815 --> 29:44.951
I mean, we all got parents

29:44.984 --> 29:47.119
that mess us up.

29:47.153 --> 29:49.956
But God isn't one of them.

29:49.989 --> 29:52.624
He knows you're perfect

29:52.658 --> 29:55.494
because that's the way
He made you.

30:01.533 --> 30:03.635
God, I hate camping.

30:03.669 --> 30:05.637
(chuckles)

30:05.671 --> 30:08.007
Yeah, me, too.

30:09.041 --> 30:11.310
Hey.

30:11.343 --> 30:13.479
What'd I miss?

30:13.512 --> 30:15.414
Island Witch.

30:15.447 --> 30:17.483
Oh, God, Caleb.

30:17.516 --> 30:19.318
Really?

30:19.351 --> 30:22.154
Where's Truck?

30:22.188 --> 30:24.323
Um, I think he went to pee.

30:24.356 --> 30:26.358
He's been gone for a while.

30:29.461 --> 30:32.865
I'll go check on him.

31:05.297 --> 31:08.500
Santificado sea tu nombre.

31:08.534 --> 31:10.502
Venga nosotros tu reino.

31:10.536 --> 31:15.174
Hágase tu voluntad.
En la tierra como en el cielo.

(door creaks)

32:19.972 --> 32:23.142
(loud, echoing thump)

32:24.610 --> 32:26.578
You got to stop doing that.
Please.

32:26.612 --> 32:27.546
Please stop doing that.

32:33.119 --> 32:35.121
(thumping continues)

32:36.989 --> 32:38.324
Truck? Hey.

32:38.357 --> 32:40.492
Truck?

32:40.526 --> 32:41.493
Truck!

32:44.430 --> 32:46.265
Truck!

-Verity!

33:15.327 --> 33:18.164
In the name
of God the Father Everlasting

33:18.197 --> 33:19.531
and all of His saints,

33:19.565 --> 33:21.467
I order you to show yourself

33:21.500 --> 33:23.335
and make your presence known!

33:23.369 --> 33:25.737
Verity!

33:27.406 --> 33:29.208
Verity!

33:29.241 --> 33:30.776
(praying in Spanish)

33:30.809 --> 33:32.010
He commands you.

33:32.044 --> 33:34.580
(continues in Spanish)

33:34.613 --> 33:36.014
He commands you!

33:39.885 --> 33:42.020
-(Verity gasping, grunting)

No. No.

-You all right? Easy, easy.

34:26.298 --> 34:28.300
Whoa, what's wrong?
What happened to Verity?

34:28.334 --> 34:29.935
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Stay away from her.

34:29.968 --> 34:32.138
-Wh... What did I do?
-Stay away from her.

34:32.171 --> 34:33.939
In and out. That's right.

Deep breaths. In and out.

34:38.944 --> 34:40.646
We need to get her to a doctor.

34:40.679 --> 34:43.149
-(croaking): I'm fine.
-No, you're not.

34:58.797 --> 35:00.766
Verity, I'm gonna take you
to-to Dr. Flores.

35:00.799 --> 35:02.601
-I think she'll be awake.
Come on. -(coughing, gasping)

35:02.634 --> 35:05.971
Easy. Easy. Easy.

35:06.004 --> 35:07.973
I-I didn't mean to hurt her.

35:08.006 --> 35:09.775
Verity, it was an accident.

35:09.808 --> 35:11.443
(gasps)

35:11.477 --> 35:13.612
Okay, honey, I'm gonna need you
to come with me.

35:13.645 --> 35:15.947
-All right?
-Wait, where's he going?

35:15.981 --> 35:17.783
Where are you taking him?

35:17.816 --> 35:19.918
There is a procedure
we have to follow, Caleb.

35:19.951 --> 35:22.321
-Um, I'm sorry. -But he's coming
back, right? He's coming back.

35:22.354 --> 35:23.789
Look, Caleb, we got to go,

Nothing at all.

That's a start.
