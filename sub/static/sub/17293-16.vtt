See, if Katherine's back,
that means hell still exists.

Maybe there's a way to
destroy the dimension itself.

00:34.181 --> 00:35.648
Destroying hell destroys her.

Even if Katherine rings the
bell, she can't create hellfire.

Only someone from the
Maxwell bloodline can do that.

Oh, and if you want to know

11:02.714 --> 11:05.782
Kai Parker was kind enough
to set that trap for me,

and, if I'm not mistaken,

11:07.485 --> 11:09.085
he's forever indisposed.

11:09.087 --> 11:11.888
After 153 odd years,

11:11.890 --> 11:14.557
this banter that we have is just old.

11:14.559 --> 11:16.092
So, why don't we just skip to the part

11:16.094 --> 11:18.895
where you tell me what you
want and we'll negotiate.

11:18.897 --> 11:23.633
I have everything I want,
Damon, or I'm about to.

11:23.635 --> 11:25.635
Once that last bell rings,

11:25.637 --> 11:27.637
this stupid town will go up in flames

11:27.639 --> 11:30.073
and everybody will go poof.

11:30.075 --> 11:31.441
Well, they'll...

11:31.443 --> 11:32.675
burn alive first,

11:32.677 --> 11:34.477
but then their ashes will go poof.

11:34.479 --> 11:35.511
You know, petty doesn't look good

11:35.513 --> 11:36.679
on a woman your age, Katherine.

11:36.681 --> 11:38.448
Oh, I'm not being petty. I'm gloating.

11:38.450 --> 11:40.016
No, you're jealous of Elena.

11:40.018 --> 11:42.251
Because you know that Stefan and I both

11:42.253 --> 11:45.588
would choose her over you every time.

11:45.590 --> 11:47.790
And she would choose Stefan.

11:47.792 --> 11:49.993
What makes you so sure of that?

11:49.995 --> 11:51.294
Because I would.

11:51.296 --> 11:52.629
Any woman would.

11:52.631 --> 11:55.131
Stefan is the better man.

11:55.133 --> 11:56.699
[chokes]

12:01.006 --> 12:03.206
[chuckles]

12:03.208 --> 12:06.142
CAROLINE: Kai spelled
her in. She can't get out.

12:06.144 --> 12:07.710
We're too far away.

12:07.712 --> 12:09.180
Can't get back in time to help.

12:09.183 --> 12:10.680
What are we supposed to do?

12:10.682 --> 12:12.582
I can't leave Elena here.

12:12.584 --> 12:13.950
It's not just Elena.

12:13.952 --> 12:15.251
BONNIE: What do you mean?

12:15.253 --> 12:17.620
You know Damon won't leave
her here to die alone.

12:24.929 --> 12:26.963
You need to head out now, Caroline.

12:26.965 --> 12:28.231
Take the tunnels.

12:28.233 --> 12:29.966
It'll be faster for you.

12:33.471 --> 12:34.871
[phone beeps]

12:37.108 --> 12:39.876
I can't believe this is happening.

12:39.878 --> 12:43.112
I need to talk to Damon.

12:43.114 --> 12:45.415
Do you think you'll convince him?

12:45.417 --> 12:47.884
No.

12:47.886 --> 12:50.353
But I have to try.

12:53.324 --> 12:56.292
I made a promise to Ric...

12:56.295 --> 13:00.397
that I wouldn't risk the girls
growing up without a mother.

13:01.700 --> 13:03.132
So I can help you

13:03.134 --> 13:05.835
- with Damon, but I can't...
- No.

13:05.837 --> 13:08.104
I can do it alone.

13:08.106 --> 13:10.039
You get to safety.

13:10.041 --> 13:11.708
Family first.

13:11.710 --> 13:13.710
We're family now. Okay?

13:13.712 --> 13:17.313
You and me and the girls.
It's just... please, please,

13:17.315 --> 13:19.415
[crying]: don't make
me leave you. Please.

13:19.418 --> 13:21.384
If I want to convince
Damon I have to move fast,

13:21.386 --> 13:23.186
and I can't do that
unless I know you're safe.

13:23.188 --> 13:25.354
[crying]: No.

13:25.356 --> 13:27.890
He's my brother.

13:31.117 --> 13:32.783
[cries]

13:35.200 --> 13:38.034
Family first.

13:43.742 --> 13:45.775
I love you so much.

13:45.777 --> 13:49.479
I love you, too.

13:59.591 --> 14:02.058
[sighs]

14:13.887 --> 14:16.887
All right, girls, why don't you
go change your dresses, okay?

14:22.410 --> 14:24.194
BONNIE: You okay?

14:25.221 --> 14:29.023
It's not that I don't care, you know.

14:29.034 --> 14:30.267
I care about Elena.

14:30.269 --> 14:32.897
It's okay, Ric. I understand.

14:32.900 --> 14:34.338
And I care about Damon.

14:34.340 --> 14:35.365
He knows you do.

14:35.368 --> 14:37.040
I don't want to fail them,

14:37.042 --> 14:39.176
but I can't fail my daughters.

14:39.178 --> 14:40.944
And they need their mother.

14:40.946 --> 14:43.380
Ric, if there was something
we could do we would do it.

14:46.004 --> 14:48.104
What is this?

14:48.107 --> 14:50.590
ALARIC: That is Project Hail-Mary.

14:50.593 --> 14:55.585
Dorian and I were trying to find
a way to destroy Cade's hell.

14:55.588 --> 14:56.874
We figured we needed

14:56.877 --> 14:59.996
a few million volts of mystical energy,

14:59.998 --> 15:01.832
just give or take.

15:01.834 --> 15:04.568
[sighs] It kind of took
the wind out of our sails.

15:07.945 --> 15:11.575
Like the kind of energy
contained in hellfire?

15:14.046 --> 15:15.746
[cell phone rings]

15:15.748 --> 15:18.248
Bonnie, is everything okay?

15:18.251 --> 15:20.384
Listen, Stefan, I know
I've been hard on you.

15:20.386 --> 15:22.552
But I also know that you
and I are equally willing

15:22.554 --> 15:24.588
to do anything we can to fix this.

15:24.590 --> 15:25.889
Absolutely.

15:25.891 --> 15:27.128
Why? Do you have something?

15:27.131 --> 15:28.525
BONNIE: I think I do,

15:28.527 --> 15:30.260
but the only way it gets
rid of Katherine Pierce

15:30.262 --> 15:32.295
is if she's in hell when I destroy it.

15:32.297 --> 15:34.297
That's where it gets tricky.

15:34.299 --> 15:36.444
Tell me what I need to do.

15:36.447 --> 15:38.068
MATT: All right, guys, keep it moving.

15:38.070 --> 15:39.269
Everybody out.

15:39.271 --> 15:41.605
[car horns beeping, sirens wailing]

15:47.195 --> 15:50.046
I need to thank you for what you
did earlier tonight in the fire.

15:50.048 --> 15:51.648
We saved you. Yeah.

15:51.650 --> 15:53.150
You did.

15:53.152 --> 15:54.618
And not just that,

15:54.620 --> 15:57.154
you made me realize
that I had all the magic

15:57.156 --> 16:00.991
I ever needed right inside me.

16:00.993 --> 16:02.793
Now give me a little luck.

16:05.747 --> 16:07.082
Right here.

16:11.937 --> 16:14.805
I made it, as promised.

16:14.807 --> 16:16.973
Any word from Stefan?

16:19.742 --> 16:21.514
Listen, we have to leave quickly.

16:21.517 --> 16:23.847
I'll explain everything
to you in the car, okay?

16:23.849 --> 16:24.915
Come on, girls, let's go.

16:24.917 --> 16:26.283
Run to the car. Run to the car.

16:29.235 --> 16:31.099
I'm gonna save the world.

16:31.102 --> 16:33.803
And you need to get in
that car and drive away.

16:33.806 --> 16:36.059
But I don't... Bonnie...

16:36.061 --> 16:37.327
ALARIC: Caroline. I'm so sorry,

16:37.329 --> 16:39.095
but we really have to go.

16:39.097 --> 16:41.217
BONNIE: Ric will fill you in.

16:41.733 --> 16:43.400
I love you.

16:46.530 --> 16:50.040
Just don't do anything
stupid, Bonnie Bennett.

16:50.042 --> 16:52.509
I'll be fine.

16:55.581 --> 16:57.180
Promise.

17:07.630 --> 17:10.060
Taking a trip down memory lane?

17:10.061 --> 17:12.529
Oh, I've missed this place...

17:12.531 --> 17:14.064
said no one ever.

17:14.066 --> 17:16.333
I figured you'd keep
showing up to annoy me.

17:17.526 --> 17:20.103
You're nothing if not
utterly predictable.

17:20.105 --> 17:23.116
And miss a minute of
the Elena Gilbert show?

17:23.118 --> 17:26.209
Speaking of which,
shouldn't you be by her side?

17:26.211 --> 17:28.178
Well, I figure now that
you're practically the devil,

17:28.180 --> 17:29.913
you'd be in the know.

17:29.915 --> 17:31.691
I just hung up with Bonnie Bennett,

17:31.694 --> 17:35.218
and she figured out
a way to save the day.

17:35.220 --> 17:37.437
Bonnie isn't strong
enough to save a kitten.

17:37.440 --> 17:39.707
She's done it once or twice,
and my money's on her.

17:39.710 --> 17:41.833
We're talking about hellfire.

17:41.836 --> 17:43.636
So intense, it could obliterate

17:43.638 --> 17:45.605
anything within miles.

17:45.607 --> 17:47.173
What the hell is Bonnie gonna do?

17:47.175 --> 17:48.541
She's 30 minutes away.

17:48.543 --> 17:50.643
If you take the highway
around the mountain,

17:50.645 --> 17:52.011
sure.

17:52.013 --> 17:53.713
But as the crow flies,

17:53.715 --> 17:55.214
it's only seven miles...

17:56.179 --> 17:59.113
...which is the beauty of these tunnels.

17:59.116 --> 18:01.587
Did you know that they go

18:01.589 --> 18:03.689
from the Armory straight into the heart

18:03.691 --> 18:05.158
of downtown Mystic Falls?

18:05.160 --> 18:07.484
Man, I bet you didn't
know that, did you?

18:07.487 --> 18:11.631
You think Bonnie Bennett
can magically draw hellfire

18:11.633 --> 18:14.234
through the tunnels away from the town?

18:14.237 --> 18:15.301
Even better.

18:15.303 --> 18:17.804
I think she can send it
straight back to hell,

18:17.806 --> 18:20.139
where you and I will be
waiting patiently for it.

18:20.141 --> 18:22.375
I got to say,

18:22.377 --> 18:24.885
I look forward to
dying by your side, KP.

18:24.888 --> 18:26.387
You're bluffing.

18:26.390 --> 18:30.550
No, he's not... and neither am I.

18:30.552 --> 18:31.918
I got this handled, bro.

18:31.920 --> 18:33.386
You need to get out of these tunnels.

18:33.388 --> 18:35.521
I'm not the one who's gonna
get out of here, Damon.

18:35.523 --> 18:36.306
You are.

18:36.309 --> 18:38.475
Bad time to be a martyr, Stefan.

18:38.478 --> 18:40.244
Said the martyr.

18:40.247 --> 18:43.048
I'm gonna let you two figure
this out amongst yourselves.

18:45.434 --> 18:46.661
[groans]

18:46.664 --> 18:48.234
Fine. Then we'll both go.

18:48.236 --> 18:50.269
Somebody needs to stay here to make sure

18:50.271 --> 18:52.271
she's actually in hell
when it's destroyed.

18:52.273 --> 18:55.308
I'm aware, Stefan.

18:55.310 --> 18:57.543
Tell Elena that I did this for her,

18:57.545 --> 18:59.912
to pay for my past mistakes.

18:59.914 --> 19:01.180
You can tell her yourself.

19:01.182 --> 19:03.749
I need to do this, Damon.

19:03.751 --> 19:06.085
I owe it to Bonnie and Enzo.

19:06.087 --> 19:07.528
I owe it to a lot of people.

19:07.531 --> 19:09.655
I'm not gonna leave
you to die here, Stefan.

19:09.657 --> 19:12.358
Yes, you are.

19:18.479 --> 19:21.028
Are you seriously gonna
sit here and argue with me

19:21.031 --> 19:22.919
about who needs this redemption more?!

19:22.921 --> 19:25.755
You're not responsible for Enzo, Stefan!

19:25.757 --> 19:27.791
You keep saying that, but you're wrong.

19:27.793 --> 19:30.460
We're all responsible
for our own actions.

19:30.462 --> 19:33.830
Every drop of blood that I've
spilled, I am accountable for.

19:33.832 --> 19:36.032
Then I'm accountable, too,
and I've spilled even more.

19:36.034 --> 19:38.301
Damon, I'm human.

19:38.303 --> 19:40.570
In 60 years, I'm gonna
be old, I'm gonna be dead.

19:40.572 --> 19:43.139
You have quite literally an eternity

19:43.141 --> 19:44.204
with Elena ahead of you.

19:44.207 --> 19:46.907
Which means a lot less without you.

19:46.910 --> 19:48.641
Do you think I want this?

19:49.581 --> 19:51.281
I just got married.

19:51.283 --> 19:53.316
My wife is out there,

19:53.318 --> 19:55.218
waiting for me to come home to her.

19:55.220 --> 19:59.389
But in the nearly two centuries

19:59.391 --> 20:01.057
since I made you become a vampire,

20:01.059 --> 20:03.627
I have fought to turn you into the man

20:03.629 --> 20:06.863
who deserves the happiness
that's out there right now.

20:06.865 --> 20:08.331
No.

20:08.333 --> 20:11.601
Just let me do this for you.

20:11.603 --> 20:12.936
No.

20:12.938 --> 20:17.107
Then let me do this for me.

20:17.109 --> 20:20.310
Please.

20:26.618 --> 20:28.852
I love you, little brother.

20:28.854 --> 20:32.556
I love you, too.

20:37.563 --> 20:39.863
And you're right.

20:39.865 --> 20:43.366
You are human...

20:46.605 --> 20:49.306
...which is why I can do this.

20:49.308 --> 20:50.840
Go.

20:50.842 --> 20:51.667
No, Damon, don't...

20:51.670 --> 20:53.543
You're gonna walk out of these tunnels,

20:53.545 --> 20:54.811
and you are not gonna stop

20:54.814 --> 20:56.586
until my death breaks the compulsion

20:56.589 --> 21:00.083
because I am the big brother.

21:01.085 --> 21:04.653
I'm sorry I wasn't
better at it until now.

21:07.225 --> 21:10.160
I said go. Go!

21:31.149 --> 21:33.249
[bell chimes]

21:38.190 --> 21:41.691
Vicki?

21:42.828 --> 21:44.027
Daddy.

21:45.230 --> 21:47.097
Hi, honey.

21:50.836 --> 21:52.702
Is this Matt's trump card?

21:52.704 --> 21:54.104
Well, it won't work.

21:54.106 --> 21:56.539
You're about 15 years
too late to be paternal.

21:56.541 --> 21:57.983
I'm not here to talk you out of it.

21:57.986 --> 21:59.376
Oh, well, that's rich.

21:59.378 --> 22:00.677
What, did you come to watch me

22:00.679 --> 22:02.746
blow myself into oblivion?

22:02.748 --> 22:05.015
Vicki, Bonnie has a plan.

22:05.017 --> 22:07.350
I am not gonna stop ringing this bell.

22:07.352 --> 22:08.985
We don't need you to stop.

22:12.991 --> 22:14.924
Well, then what are you doing here?

22:19.998 --> 22:22.835
I just wanted to see my
daughter one last time.

22:41.019 --> 22:43.486
Tell me what's going on.

22:46.058 --> 22:49.626
I don't know what to say, Caroline.

22:49.628 --> 22:51.695
Stefan, he's...

22:51.697 --> 22:54.364
he's made a decision.

23:12.017 --> 23:14.084
Okay, Grams,

23:14.086 --> 23:17.654
if I ever needed you to hear me,

23:17.656 --> 23:20.023
hear me now.

23:23.562 --> 23:28.098

23:28.100 --> 23:30.867

24:03.702 --> 24:07.637

<i>Ego ex vos. Vos ex unos.</i>

24:11.143 --> 24:13.243
[sobbing]

24:17.649 --> 24:19.249
Stop the car.

24:19.251 --> 24:20.784
I said stop!

24:20.786 --> 24:22.919

24:30.662 --> 24:32.771
[line ringing]

STEFAN [taped message]:
Hey, it's Stefan.

24:34.466 --> 24:35.903
Leave a message.
