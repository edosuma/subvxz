00:24.181 --> 00:27.081
-[woman] Students,
proceed to desks quietly.

00:27.181 --> 00:29.820
Please open your computers now.

00:30.900 --> 00:33.840
Please commence your exams now.

00:33.940 --> 00:36.699
You have 40 minutes
to complete the first section.

-[Lloyd] Why don't we just have like
a little gathering in the backyard?

02:05.806 --> 02:07.346
-[Ivy] No!
-[Lloyd] Why not?

02:07.446 --> 02:10.045
-[Ivy] 'Cause I don't want one.
-[Lloyd] But why not?

02:12.765 --> 02:14.585
-[Ivy] Since when
do I have to have a reason?

02:14.685 --> 02:16.105
It's my birthday.

02:16.205 --> 02:18.824
I should be able to choose
whether I have a party or not.

02:18.924 --> 02:22.064
Sweetheart, I don't mind if
it's just me and a pizza, OK,

02:22.164 --> 02:26.823
but I just think that we need to...
we need to mark the occasion somehow.

02:26.923 --> 02:28.923
-Really?
I don't see what's to celebrate.

02:31.362 --> 02:33.362
Baby, hey...

02:34.122 --> 02:35.462
There's a lot to celebrate.

02:35.562 --> 02:37.721
-Like?
-Like you.

02:39.321 --> 02:43.481
Like everything you bring to us,
everything you bring to the world.

02:44.960 --> 02:47.660
Because you're a beautiful,
beautiful, intelligent person

02:47.760 --> 02:49.620
and I'm just really, really
proud of you.

02:49.720 --> 02:52.119
Sounds like my funeral.

03:03.598 --> 03:05.597
-Poppet...
-Can I have my hand back?

03:06.877 --> 03:08.217
What?

03:08.317 --> 03:09.897
You're a sight for sore eyes.

03:09.997 --> 03:11.996
Hey, hey.

03:12.316 --> 03:14.056
How's your... How's your day?

03:14.156 --> 03:16.056
Well, I managed
not to throttle anyone, so...

03:16.156 --> 03:17.735
-That's a positive.
-Not really.

03:17.835 --> 03:19.575
-No, that's a definite improvement.

03:19.675 --> 03:21.675
How did your exams go?

03:24.155 --> 03:26.154
That good, huh?

03:27.114 --> 03:29.114
Ouch.

03:37.913 --> 03:39.452
-[Lloyd] This has to stop.

03:39.552 --> 03:40.812
It's OK.

03:40.912 --> 03:42.912
It's not OK, babe.

03:43.712 --> 03:47.011
I'm gonna call the insurance company.
I'm gonna get them uninstall the software.

03:47.111 --> 03:49.171
It's just for another month.

03:49.271 --> 03:50.771
You shouldn't have to go through this.

03:50.871 --> 03:52.650
I'm fine, Lloyd.

03:52.750 --> 03:55.590
Really, I'm... I'm fine.

04:31.145 --> 04:33.824

Get your hands off me!

on the floor!

[grunting]

04:47.262 --> 04:48.842
-[police officer] Stay back.

04:48.942 --> 04:50.942
[laughter]

04:53.501 --> 04:54.921
-[Lloyd] Hey.

04:55.021 --> 04:58.481
-[police officer] Get up, move, move.

04:58.581 --> 04:59.840
[spitting]

04:59.940 --> 05:01.940
Hey, let's go.
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

05:10.459 --> 05:15.558
So I'm thinking about taking a six-month
sabbatical from the hospital.

05:15.658 --> 05:17.858
Offer my services to the centre
full-time.

05:20.857 --> 05:24.477
Is there a position for you there
in your field?

05:24.577 --> 05:28.016
Not exactly. I'll have to
remember back to my pre-med days.

05:29.056 --> 05:30.876
Right. I just um...

05:30.976 --> 05:34.155
I remember how many hoops
you had to jump through to um...

05:34.255 --> 05:35.835
to make specialist.

05:35.935 --> 05:38.755
It's just seeing all those people
and hearing their stories,

05:38.855 --> 05:40.115
it's hard to look away.

05:40.215 --> 05:43.514
And if I can help heal some of
their trauma with the skills I have

05:43.614 --> 05:45.514
to help them get back on their feet...

05:45.614 --> 05:47.113
-[Ivy] So they can what?

05:47.213 --> 05:49.473
Go back out there
and cop more of the same shit?

05:49.573 --> 05:51.273
-Hey, Ivy.
-Well, it's true, isn't it?

05:51.373 --> 05:54.172
-What...? Hey, hey. Ivy, Ivy.

05:55.892 --> 05:58.312
Wow. She's in a dark place.

05:58.412 --> 06:03.431
Yeah. How am I meant to tell her
everything's gonna be alright?

06:03.531 --> 06:06.091
Because it is gonna be alright.

06:15.329 --> 06:17.329
-[man] See you later.

06:19.489 --> 06:22.428
Why go digital when you can
knock down a tree, right?

06:22.528 --> 06:25.108
Can't smell the pages
of an online edition, Ivy.

06:25.208 --> 06:29.027
And it's made from
recycled plantation paper.

06:29.127 --> 06:32.487
'Cause you baby boomers
cut down all the old growth forests.

06:34.287 --> 06:37.046
How are you two?
Last night was pretty scary.

06:38.206 --> 06:39.626
Shouldn't have opened the door.

06:39.726 --> 06:41.725
What did they want from you?

06:42.765 --> 06:44.845
What do scum like that always want, hm?

-[man] Open! Open!

07:18.320 --> 07:19.780
[indistinct shouting]

07:19.880 --> 07:21.980
-[woman] Don't make me...

07:22.080 --> 07:24.059
[indistinct shouting]

07:24.159 --> 07:26.219
-[man] Play on, play on!
[cheering, shouting]

07:39.877 --> 07:41.877
[indistinct shouting]

07:42.796 --> 07:44.416
-[Abel] What about the foul, ref?

07:44.516 --> 07:46.836
-[Eadie] Run, Leroy. Go! All the way!

07:47.836 --> 07:49.056
[whistle blows]

07:49.156 --> 07:51.015
You know, impartiality
comes with the whistle.

07:51.115 --> 07:52.575
Sounds like 3-2 to me.

07:52.675 --> 07:54.135
How do you know?
You can't see two feet ahead.

07:54.235 --> 07:56.374
-Leroy, was it a goal?
-Back of the net, sister.

07:56.474 --> 07:58.494
-Yes!
-Total corruption.

07:58.594 --> 08:00.054
Come on, boys, let's go!

08:00.154 --> 08:02.154
[Eadie coughs]

08:05.113 --> 08:08.353
[heavy breathing]

08:11.432 --> 08:13.912
[notification alert]

08:15.832 --> 08:17.331
-[Abel] Alright, guys.
-Shit.

08:17.431 --> 08:19.431
-[Abel] Just go on straight through
that tent over here.

08:24.390 --> 08:26.390
-[Abel] You can all just set up in there.

08:27.590 --> 08:29.590
-[Abel] Thank you.

08:30.789 --> 08:32.689
-[Abel] Thank you.

08:32.789 --> 08:34.789
[Eadie breathing heavily]

08:38.028 --> 08:40.128
The showers are still running hot,
I'm told.

08:40.228 --> 08:43.128
Oh, uh... [clears throat]
I'm fine.

08:43.228 --> 08:45.247
Have you looked in the mirror?
You're a walking biohazard.

08:45.347 --> 08:46.527
Just grab yourself a towel

08:46.627 --> 08:48.647
and some clothes from the bin
and get in there.

08:48.747 --> 08:52.086
-[woman] That's great, come forward.
Forward.

08:52.186 --> 08:55.026
[indistinct PA announcements]

09:17.463 --> 09:19.602
-[Abel] Why'd you study for ten years,

09:19.702 --> 09:21.722
you get the nameplate on the door

09:21.822 --> 09:26.361
and you come here and you trade it in
to be a glorified first-aid officer.

09:26.461 --> 09:29.801
I have a thing about band aids.

09:29.901 --> 09:31.920
Have since I was a kid.

09:32.020 --> 09:34.060
[laughs]

09:36.780 --> 09:41.819
Hey, um... what's the story
with this new medical team?

09:43.099 --> 09:46.278
Guys from Uconica Labs
trialling a new chagas vaccine.

09:46.378 --> 09:48.538
That anything do with your husband?

09:52.337 --> 09:57.577
[tense music]

10:02.856 --> 10:05.795
-[Lloyd] Seriously, you show up
to work every second day,

10:05.895 --> 10:07.895
and when you do, you're trashed.

10:08.375 --> 10:10.275
I guess I woke up with the realisation

10:10.375 --> 10:13.034
that my five minutes of fame
might be over.

10:13.134 --> 10:15.114
I think I was ripped off
a minute or two.

10:15.214 --> 10:18.354
We're gonna crack it. We just have to
look at it from a different angle.

10:18.454 --> 10:19.593
-OK, whatever you say.

10:19.693 --> 10:21.433
Jesus wept.

10:21.533 --> 10:23.393
Between you and Ivy...

10:23.493 --> 10:24.793
-What's wrong with Ives?

10:24.893 --> 10:26.892
-I have no idea.

10:28.772 --> 10:31.152
She's spiralling into
some existential black hole

10:31.252 --> 10:34.671
and I don't have 'Spaceship Enterprise'
to navigate her out of it.

10:34.771 --> 10:36.271
Or the right metaphor.

10:36.371 --> 10:38.371
[phone rings]

10:39.890 --> 10:40.910
Hey, love.

10:41.010 --> 10:43.430
Have you heard of a group called Uconica?

10:43.530 --> 10:45.030
-Uconica, no. Should I have?

10:45.130 --> 10:50.169
They have a medical team here
offering a chagas vaccine.

10:53.448 --> 10:54.988
Are you sure it's for chagas?

10:55.088 --> 10:57.628
Shay... Uconica?

10:57.728 --> 10:59.587
-Hey?
-Uconica?

10:59.687 --> 11:03.327
It doesn't look like
some backyard operation either.

11:04.447 --> 11:07.226
Could they have copied your idea
from the presentation?

11:07.326 --> 11:09.826
No, I don't see it. We deliberately
held back information.

11:09.926 --> 11:12.386
And even if they did,
it's too quick to trial.

11:12.486 --> 11:14.625
It's... The whole thing's too quick.

11:14.725 --> 11:17.745
Listen, I'm gonna make some calls.
Thank you for the heads-up.

11:17.845 --> 11:19.845
What?

11:21.124 --> 11:23.124
Someone's beaten us to the punch.

11:25.964 --> 11:28.103
Yeah, I want to speak to Herman, please.

11:28.203 --> 11:30.203
Thank you.

11:30.803 --> 11:32.503
-[Herman] Yeah, thanks, Earl.

11:32.603 --> 11:34.382
Look, if you could get back to me
on that ASAP,

11:34.482 --> 11:36.482
I'd appreciate it.

11:37.482 --> 11:40.202
Uconica only listed as a company
two weeks ago.

11:41.201 --> 11:42.661
Who's the parent company?

11:42.761 --> 11:44.741
Details not available at this point.

11:44.841 --> 11:47.300
-[Lloyd] Right. I'm not sure which is
more alarming, Herman -

11:47.400 --> 11:49.380
the fact that you don't know
who our competition is

11:49.480 --> 11:52.420
or that some unknown company
managed to get the jump on us

11:52.520 --> 11:55.339
without a single published paper
or a peer review.

11:55.439 --> 11:57.019
Are you saying there's been a data breach?

11:57.119 --> 11:59.999
Well, it's starting to look that way
to me, Herman. What do you think?

12:00.998 --> 12:03.398
-I'll speak to I.T.
-There's an idea.

12:04.398 --> 12:06.398
[tense music]

12:18.276 --> 12:19.296
-[woman] Next please.

12:19.396 --> 12:21.395
[baby crying]

12:23.395 --> 12:24.775
Are you OK?

12:24.875 --> 12:26.335
I've had better days.

12:26.435 --> 12:29.994
There's three residency points on offer
if they sign up for the trial.

12:35.393 --> 12:36.493
-[Abel] I'm not asking you to lie just...

12:36.593 --> 12:38.933
Turn a blind eye long enough
for my guys to pick up...

12:39.033 --> 12:41.033
-[Eadie] Abel.

12:42.712 --> 12:44.612
Screw the insurance company!

12:44.712 --> 12:48.052
Climate Mitigation Review Voucher
for the Uconica vax.

12:48.152 --> 12:49.651
What's that?

12:49.751 --> 12:52.331
When a disease is considered
a big enough threat,

12:52.431 --> 12:54.051
you can apply to fast-track it.

12:54.151 --> 12:58.530
That voucher, it let's you leap over
a tonne of safety nets.

12:58.630 --> 13:01.170
It gets you to limited human trials
in a heartbeat.

13:01.270 --> 13:03.769
-[Abel] Bless you. I'll have my guys over
within a half hour. Thanks.

13:03.869 --> 13:05.369
Sorry about that.

13:05.469 --> 13:09.368
Lloyd, Shay...
caught you guys on the news.

13:09.468 --> 13:10.648
Congratulations, by the way.

13:10.748 --> 13:14.248
Yeah, we're just a little surprised at
the speed this has gone to human trials

13:14.348 --> 13:16.727
without the usual checks and balances.

13:16.827 --> 13:19.407
Lloyd and Shay are worried
that their data's been stolen.

13:19.507 --> 13:21.647
If this has a version
of our technique in it,

13:21.747 --> 13:25.366
there could be serious health implications
for your volunteers.

13:25.466 --> 13:27.606
We discovered some worrying
side effects.

13:27.706 --> 13:30.765
That's why we pushed the big fat
pause button on our work.

13:30.865 --> 13:33.205
I read Uconica's disclosure clauses.

13:33.305 --> 13:35.205
Fifty per cent chance of sterility.

13:35.305 --> 13:37.364
They didn't mention that, huh?

13:37.464 --> 13:40.564
Look, I'm sorry, I don't know
what you'd like me to do here.

13:40.664 --> 13:44.463
You tell me this might be stolen.
But do you have anything to back that up?

13:48.143 --> 13:49.323
No.

13:49.423 --> 13:52.142
The second you know either way,
please, let me know.

13:53.822 --> 13:55.822
-[Lloyd] Thank you.

13:59.141 --> 14:01.141
Karima, Shay Levine.

14:01.901 --> 14:03.900
We need to talk.

14:06.900 --> 14:08.600
So, what now?

14:08.700 --> 14:11.359
I'd kill to get my hands on a sample.

14:11.459 --> 14:12.759
[phone rings]

14:12.859 --> 14:14.859
I'll see what I can do.

14:16.339 --> 14:18.778
Gab, now is not a good time...

14:21.818 --> 14:23.817
Where is she now?

14:32.536 --> 14:34.236
Refusing to sit your exams now?

14:34.336 --> 14:36.276
Technically I sat them.

14:36.376 --> 14:38.715
You left the page blank, Ivy.

14:38.815 --> 14:41.715
We were asked to explore
the theme of emptiness.

14:41.815 --> 14:44.134
I think I covered it from every angle.

14:47.894 --> 14:50.474
So what's gonna happen with
your biology paper,

14:50.574 --> 14:52.833
your French and your history -
are you gonna sit them out too?

14:52.933 --> 14:53.993
I'm thinking about it.

14:54.093 --> 14:57.413
OK, alright, fine. I don't care.
I don't care about school.

14:58.332 --> 15:01.672
I care about you. I care about
what's going on with you, Ivy.

15:01.772 --> 15:03.512
All I want is for you to talk to me, OK?

15:03.612 --> 15:05.611
I just want you to...

15:06.251 --> 15:07.671
be happy.

15:07.771 --> 15:10.091
I know that's what you want, Dad.

15:23.409 --> 15:25.408
I'm gonna walk home.

15:32.847 --> 15:34.967
Maybe you could have a word to her.

15:36.007 --> 15:40.766
No, no, maybe your negativity and hers,
maybe it just cancels each other out.

15:41.446 --> 15:43.446
[scoff]

15:49.885 --> 15:51.884
-[PA] Attention, attention...

15:55.724 --> 15:58.743
-[Eadie] Hey, who's a shy bear?

15:58.843 --> 16:00.503
That's OK. That's OK.

16:00.603 --> 16:02.343
-[Leroy] Come on, Tal,
this'll be good for you.

16:02.443 --> 16:04.823
Maybe I should have a try?

16:04.923 --> 16:06.422
Yeah, good idea.

16:06.522 --> 16:08.942
One quick Ventolin puff is all she needs.

16:09.042 --> 16:11.142
Maybe take Sifa so I can...

16:11.242 --> 16:12.421
Ah, yeah, sure.

16:12.521 --> 16:14.541
[Sifa cries]

16:14.641 --> 16:16.641
Shh, shh, shh.

16:24.320 --> 16:30.719
[gentle music]

16:32.838 --> 16:34.918
[inaudible dialogue]

16:37.278 --> 16:39.098
-[woman] I'm done.

16:39.198 --> 16:41.197
Oh, yeah...

16:41.797 --> 16:43.217
You have beautiful children.

16:43.317 --> 16:44.617
They're not for sale.

16:44.717 --> 16:47.096
Leroy... maybe.

16:47.196 --> 16:48.656
Mum!

16:48.756 --> 16:50.216
[laughter]

16:50.316 --> 16:52.576
Was there anything else I can do for you?

16:52.676 --> 16:55.675
You could get us on the list
for the chagas vaccine.

16:56.715 --> 16:58.175
Uh...

16:58.275 --> 17:01.894
It's a private company that's
handling the vaccination process.

17:01.994 --> 17:03.454
They've shut up shop for the day.

17:03.554 --> 17:04.734
Tomorrow then?

17:04.834 --> 17:08.373
You should know, there might be
some dangerous side effects.

17:08.473 --> 17:10.013
My sister died of chagas.

17:10.113 --> 17:14.532
So... if there's a shot at
sparing my family from that

17:14.632 --> 17:16.632
and grabbing extra residency points...

17:17.312 --> 17:19.372
I want to take it.

17:19.472 --> 17:23.891
If you can let me know how I can
get on the trial, I would appreciate it.

17:23.991 --> 17:25.991
Right.

17:27.630 --> 17:29.910
[indistinct PA announcements]

17:31.350 --> 17:35.369
Eadie, uh... next time you see my dad,

17:35.469 --> 17:36.929
can you give him this for me?

17:37.029 --> 17:39.329
Absolutely. I'm heading over there
this afternoon.

17:39.429 --> 17:42.408
Are you OK? You don't look so good.

17:42.508 --> 17:44.168
Thanks for the compliment.

17:44.268 --> 17:46.268
-I'm fine.
-OK.

17:55.866 --> 17:57.906
[sighs]

18:08.544 --> 18:10.784
[tense music]

18:46.059 --> 18:48.099
Do you reckon there'll be
enough traces to work with?

18:49.618 --> 18:51.618
Should be.

18:52.418 --> 18:55.078
Hey, I'll um... leave you guys to it.

18:55.178 --> 18:58.037
Thank you for the uh...

18:58.137 --> 18:59.397
the break and enter.

18:59.497 --> 19:01.637
Anytime.

19:01.737 --> 19:03.196
I'm so sorry.

19:03.296 --> 19:05.296
You guys have worked so hard.

19:12.855 --> 19:14.855
OK, well...

19:18.534 --> 19:21.834
You've got this, man.
I might take an early mark.

19:21.934 --> 19:23.793
What? You're kidding.

19:23.893 --> 19:27.153
Someone might have stolen our entire
life's work, you want to leave, now?

19:27.253 --> 19:29.652
I was gonna give some
religious instruction to Ivy.

19:30.692 --> 19:32.692
She's home, yeah?

19:33.772 --> 19:36.211
Yeah. Yeah, she's home.

19:51.809 --> 19:55.169
-[Karima]<i> I'm not here right now,</i>
<i>please leave a message.</i>

19:56.888 --> 19:59.108
[door unlocking]

19:59.208 --> 20:01.208
I made scones.

20:01.648 --> 20:03.707
That's what old people eat, right?

20:03.807 --> 20:05.947
I've never had a scone in my life.

20:06.047 --> 20:08.507
Arnold, Ivy's here.

20:08.607 --> 20:10.606
Come in.

20:13.406 --> 20:15.026
You gave them what they wanted, right?

20:15.126 --> 20:17.025
Everything we had.

20:17.125 --> 20:19.485
How come they still
smashed the place up, then?

20:20.525 --> 20:21.985
Because they could.

20:22.085 --> 20:24.504
I'll put the kettle on, shall I?

20:24.604 --> 20:26.784
Milk and sugar, Ivy?

20:26.884 --> 20:28.884
Yeah, three, thanks.

20:31.123 --> 20:34.943
Our daughter Megan's
11th birthday party, Haddon Reserve.

20:35.043 --> 20:39.762
Yeah, I know it. Looks so different.
The beach has gone now.

20:40.762 --> 20:45.401
Must have been so cool growing up not
knowing that the world had a use-by date.

20:47.521 --> 20:49.521
[Ivy exhales]

20:59.839 --> 21:02.059
Enjoy your walk, Miss Green.

21:02.159 --> 21:03.859
-Israel.
-Miss Boulay.

21:03.959 --> 21:06.218
Eadie, Israel. Call me Eadie.

21:06.318 --> 21:09.478
I have something for you.

21:10.718 --> 21:12.717
From your lovely boy.

21:14.117 --> 21:16.057
He's a good kid.

21:16.157 --> 21:19.056
Yeah, it's hard for me to get to
the centre with my work here.

21:19.156 --> 21:21.816
Talk to my brother.
Tell him your situation.

21:21.916 --> 21:24.136
I'm sure he'll understand.

21:24.236 --> 21:27.495
Hey, how's Talia?
Rima said she wasn't well.

21:27.595 --> 21:30.095
Yeah, she struggled with the effects of
the dust storm, poor thing.

21:30.195 --> 21:32.974
But the puffer seemed to do
the trick. She's doing OK now.

21:33.074 --> 21:36.354
It must be so hard for you all,
not being under the same roof.

21:37.394 --> 21:39.773
-Not long now.
-How many sleeps?

21:39.873 --> 21:42.933
Three, if everything goes
according to plan

21:43.033 --> 21:44.893
and we get our residency permits.

21:44.993 --> 21:49.412
Listen, your wife was making some
inquiries about a new chagas vaccine

21:49.512 --> 21:50.852
that's being trialled at the centre.

21:50.952 --> 21:55.291
You should know there are some
serious safety issues with the vax,

21:55.391 --> 21:58.491
relating to fertility problems.

21:58.591 --> 22:01.130
Well, the vax comes with
three residency points.

22:01.230 --> 22:06.929
I know the offer of extra points is
tempting, but if I were in your shoes...

22:07.029 --> 22:09.109
But you're not... are you?

22:10.669 --> 22:13.408
Thank you for looking out for
my family, Miss Boulay.

22:13.508 --> 22:15.748
I'll let Mr. Boulay know that you're here.

22:19.108 --> 22:21.727
So, where did we go on the weekend?

22:21.827 --> 22:23.087
The farm.

22:23.187 --> 22:24.647
Uh-uh!

22:24.747 --> 22:26.966
Archie, where did we go at the weekend?

22:27.066 --> 22:29.286
-What's going on?
-We went sailing on the weekend.

22:29.386 --> 22:31.646
-Why are we lying to Auntie Eadie?
-We're not.

22:31.746 --> 22:33.405
We're keeping it a surprise
for when we take her there.

22:33.505 --> 22:34.565
Are you for real?

22:34.665 --> 22:38.605
Come on, princess, one more time.
Where did we go at the weekend?

22:38.705 --> 22:39.844
We went sailing.

22:39.944 --> 22:41.964
Yay! Have a cannoli.

22:42.064 --> 22:43.204
-[Eadie] Hey. How you doing?

22:43.304 --> 22:45.804
We went sailing. We went sailing.
We went sailing.

22:45.904 --> 22:48.243
Did you, sweetheart?
Oh, that sounds like fun.

22:48.343 --> 22:50.383
[Cosmo grunts]

22:51.943 --> 22:53.942
I'll go talk to him, shall I?

22:54.422 --> 22:56.422
-Catch you up.
-OK.

22:58.542 --> 22:59.961
What was all that about?

23:00.061 --> 23:02.301
It's just Cos being Cos.

23:03.341 --> 23:05.361
-How are you travelling?
-Travelling fine.

23:05.461 --> 23:07.160
How are you travelling, more to the point?

23:07.260 --> 23:09.260
You look like shit.

23:09.660 --> 23:11.980
Have you been to the doctor
or are you self-diagnosing again?

23:12.980 --> 23:15.519
I can get you into the facility here
if you like.

23:15.619 --> 23:17.079
Honestly, it's fine.

23:17.179 --> 23:19.559
Oh, hi. It's Dominic Boulay.

23:19.659 --> 23:22.318
Can you tell Dr. Carras that I'm gonna be
coming down with someone

23:22.418 --> 23:24.418
and that she might need to
break out the jelly snakes.

23:26.098 --> 23:28.097
Thanks.

23:30.737 --> 23:33.397
-[Shay] This is my old stomping ground.
-[Ivy] Seriously?

23:33.497 --> 23:35.816
Yep. Used to hang out here with me mates.

23:38.936 --> 23:41.755
So, I hear you're
boycotting your birthday.

23:41.855 --> 23:43.315
-Here we go.

23:43.415 --> 23:45.275
-I'm just curious. I'm not judging you.

23:45.375 --> 23:47.714
You can do what you want. I'm with you.

23:47.814 --> 23:50.274
Birthdays mostly suck.

23:50.374 --> 23:52.354
Reverse psychology - nice one.

23:52.454 --> 23:54.453
[Shay chuckles]

23:58.013 --> 24:00.173
I just don't see the point, OK.

24:02.612 --> 24:06.332
-[Shay] I got invited to
a 13th birthday here once.

24:09.331 --> 24:12.851
When I arrived, I was expecting to see,
you know, adults and kids and...

24:14.531 --> 24:17.150
streamers and balloons
and, you know, all the usual shite.

24:17.250 --> 24:19.250
But when I got here, there was nothing.

24:20.730 --> 24:22.729
No streamers, no balloons.

24:23.889 --> 24:25.889
Not even a cake.

24:27.129 --> 24:30.428
And only one other kid
bothered to rock up.

24:30.528 --> 24:32.528
-So what did you do?

24:35.807 --> 24:37.807
Kicked the footy around.

24:38.567 --> 24:40.567
Like we did most afternoons.

24:41.327 --> 24:43.326
-Where were his parents?

24:45.166 --> 24:46.586
I don't know, really.

24:46.686 --> 24:48.686
Guess they were in...

24:49.205 --> 24:51.205
separation land or...

24:52.725 --> 24:54.105
couldn't be arsed.

24:54.205 --> 24:55.984
-So the moral of the story is -

24:56.084 --> 24:58.084
feel lucky for what you have?

24:59.084 --> 25:00.864
I don't do morals.

25:00.964 --> 25:02.963
Some godfather.

25:04.923 --> 25:06.923
[Ivy laughs]

25:10.322 --> 25:12.322
It actually sounds like
a pretty good party.

25:13.322 --> 25:14.582
Real, at least.

25:14.682 --> 25:18.201
Better than having to pretend
that everything's gonna be alright.

25:22.800 --> 25:25.200
[melancholy guitar music]

25:27.120 --> 25:30.619
Sometimes we do things for others
that don't feel right for us

25:30.719 --> 25:32.719
because the benefit for them...

25:33.919 --> 25:35.919
is worth the cost to you.

25:40.318 --> 25:42.538
You're telling me to get over myself.

25:42.638 --> 25:45.397
In the nicest possible way, yeah.

25:47.677 --> 25:50.216
Hup!
Come on!

25:50.316 --> 25:52.316
-Where are we going?
-Come on!

25:53.676 --> 25:55.676
Come on!

25:57.075 --> 25:58.975
[panting]

25:59.075 --> 26:01.075
[grunt]

26:01.915 --> 26:04.914
BP's slightly elevated.

26:06.954 --> 26:09.974
You're lowered immune system
explains your fever.

26:10.074 --> 26:11.493
But I imagine you know that.

26:11.593 --> 26:13.593
How pregnant are you?

26:15.673 --> 26:17.672
It's my 63rd day.

26:19.032 --> 26:22.812
I'd like to do an ultrasound scan,
check how the baby's doing.

26:22.912 --> 26:24.911
You up for that?

26:25.791 --> 26:27.791
Yeah, just...

26:29.311 --> 26:32.310
I just always imagined my husband
being here for this moment.

26:34.630 --> 26:38.049
He's been right by my side
through all the misfires...

26:38.149 --> 26:40.149
flowers in hand.

26:40.909 --> 26:42.909
I started to hate the smell of daffodils.

26:44.508 --> 26:47.088
I can give you a copy of the ultrasound?

26:47.188 --> 26:49.508
It's not the same thing, I know.

26:52.067 --> 26:54.167
OK.

26:54.267 --> 26:56.307
[crickets chirp]

26:58.266 --> 27:00.266
[ethereal music]

27:04.626 --> 27:07.125
So, did you and Dad play here as well?

27:07.225 --> 27:08.645
No.

27:08.745 --> 27:10.745
But you go back, yeah?

27:11.824 --> 27:13.924
Uni.

27:14.024 --> 27:16.284
You and Eadie met at uni too?

27:16.384 --> 27:18.383
Yep.

27:19.183 --> 27:21.203
Who met who first?

27:21.303 --> 27:23.043
You and Dad or you and Eadie?

27:23.143 --> 27:25.902
I knew Eadie before I knew your dad.

27:27.262 --> 27:29.262
How well did you know Eadie?

27:32.421 --> 27:33.881
Did you have sex?

27:33.981 --> 27:35.981
No.

27:37.381 --> 27:38.880
But you wanted to.

27:38.980 --> 27:40.980
Jesus Christ.

27:42.580 --> 27:44.040
Alright, come on.

27:44.140 --> 27:45.879
We've only got five minutes.

27:45.979 --> 27:47.279
For what?

27:47.379 --> 27:50.059
Patience, god daughter!
Patience.

27:51.579 --> 27:53.618
[solemn music]

28:06.016 --> 28:08.056
-[Shay] Oi, stop. [mumbles]

28:10.616 --> 28:12.555
What are you doing?

28:12.655 --> 28:14.655
-[Shay] All right, I can't breathe.
All right, you ready?

28:16.895 --> 28:17.875
[laughter]

28:17.975 --> 28:20.294
-[Shay] Yeah, you're laughin',
you're dead! All right...

28:21.374 --> 28:22.594
Arrgh!

28:22.694 --> 28:24.194
Aww.

28:24.294 --> 28:25.354
-[Shay] Don't get older.

28:25.454 --> 28:26.833
You're such a dag!

28:26.933 --> 28:28.933
-[Shay] Deal with it.

28:32.293 --> 28:34.292
[ethereal music]

28:41.931 --> 28:44.571
[quivering inhale]

28:47.890 --> 28:49.890
Ah.

28:50.250 --> 28:51.830
[heartbeat]

28:51.930 --> 28:54.829
The foetal heartbeats are nice and strong.

Oh my god, am I...

29:00.568 --> 29:01.988
Is that...

29:02.088 --> 29:03.428
-You're having twins.

29:03.528 --> 29:05.508
You knew that, right?

29:05.608 --> 29:07.927
[laughing]

29:08.887 --> 29:10.887
No.

29:11.447 --> 29:13.447
-[nurse] Congratulations.

30:15.077 --> 30:17.057
Alright, hold the moon.

30:17.157 --> 30:19.057
Put your arms a bit lower.

30:19.157 --> 30:21.217
There you go.

30:21.317 --> 30:23.316
You've done this before.

[phone pings]

30:32.635 --> 30:34.635
[solemn music]

31:07.910 --> 31:09.909
You've got some missed calls.

31:12.229 --> 31:13.609
Something on your mind?

31:13.709 --> 31:17.488
I figure there's not six degrees
of separation between you and Uconica.

31:17.588 --> 31:19.488
We don't have to play that game, Shay.

31:19.588 --> 31:21.608
-What I gave you was broken.

31:21.708 --> 31:24.567
And what I thought was gonna happen is
what you said was gonna happen.

31:24.667 --> 31:26.767
You throw a shitload of cash
and your best people at it

31:26.867 --> 31:28.287
until you find a fix or you'd bin it.

31:28.387 --> 31:29.926
You've gone straight to human trial.

31:30.026 --> 31:32.406
I offered you a chance
to help drive the project.

31:32.506 --> 31:36.206
You sold your say in what happens with it
when you opted for a payout instead.

31:36.306 --> 31:38.305
Oh...

31:42.105 --> 31:44.664
Don't pretend to make this about money,
Karima.

31:45.904 --> 31:48.184
You were gonna screw me
whether I took it or not.

31:49.224 --> 31:50.603
Do you give a shit?

31:50.703 --> 31:54.663
These people have no idea
what they're putting their hand up for.

31:55.783 --> 31:58.202
You're playing Russian roulette
with their lives.

31:58.302 --> 32:01.542
We did the lab work.
Risk-ratio met board standards.

32:03.861 --> 32:05.561
We had to fast-track it for a reason.

32:05.661 --> 32:07.861
We don't have five years.

32:11.140 --> 32:13.140
Get out of your bubble, Shay.

32:27.578 --> 32:28.638
-[man] Hey!

32:28.738 --> 32:30.738
-[Shay] Sorry

32:31.897 --> 32:36.737

32:52.414 --> 32:54.634
Hey. Where have you been?

32:54.734 --> 32:56.354
I've been trying to call you.

32:56.454 --> 32:58.453
-Where's Ivy?
-Upstairs.

32:59.413 --> 33:01.413
It's our vax.

33:01.893 --> 33:03.633
I'm so sorry.

33:03.733 --> 33:06.472
You guys are steamrolling ahead,
I take it.

33:06.572 --> 33:08.392
I'm not steamrolling anything.

33:08.492 --> 33:10.072
No, your buddy, willing and Abel.

33:10.172 --> 33:12.031
He's probably receiving kickbacks.

33:12.131 --> 33:14.131
You're wrong there.

33:17.051 --> 33:19.050
Straight to his defence, Eadie.

33:20.730 --> 33:23.330
[solemn music]

33:26.249 --> 33:27.709
I'm sorry.

33:27.809 --> 33:29.809
Sorry.

33:31.249 --> 33:33.888
I'm just behaving like
a jealous schoolboy.

33:35.128 --> 33:36.148
-[Lloyd] I miss you.

33:36.248 --> 33:38.628
I know you need to focus
on something else right now

33:38.728 --> 33:40.727
and I get it, I really do.

33:41.527 --> 33:43.687
I'm just really looking forward
to getting you back.

33:45.127 --> 33:48.606
[tender music]

33:51.806 --> 33:53.805
I'm gonna go and check on Ivy.

34:05.844 --> 34:07.843
[knock at door]

34:09.843 --> 34:11.843
-Hey.
-Hey.

34:19.482 --> 34:21.681
You hang out with Shay today?

34:22.681 --> 34:24.021
That was the idea, wasn't it?

34:24.121 --> 34:26.181
Control freak father.

34:26.281 --> 34:29.580
Well, that's just part of the territory,
I'm afraid.

34:29.680 --> 34:32.160
That and uh,
that and bad dad jokes.

34:33.799 --> 34:35.879
What did you guys do?

34:36.879 --> 34:38.339
I don't know - shit.

34:38.439 --> 34:40.458
Mm. Fun shit?

34:40.558 --> 34:42.558
Yeah, kind of.

34:46.478 --> 34:47.497
What...

34:47.597 --> 34:49.597
[laughter]

34:51.197 --> 34:52.857
So, how are things with you?

34:52.957 --> 34:55.536
Shay told me that
your research got hacked.

34:55.636 --> 34:58.176
Yeah. Yeah, it was a bit of a bummer.

34:58.276 --> 35:00.276
So, what are you gonna do?

35:02.115 --> 35:05.535
We are going to figure out
who stole the research.

35:05.635 --> 35:07.634
We're gonna nail their ass to the wall.

35:08.114 --> 35:09.574
We're gonna get a court injunction.

35:09.674 --> 35:11.214
We're gonna stop their trial
in its tracks.

35:11.314 --> 35:12.974
And we are going to figure out
what is wrong with ours

35:13.074 --> 35:15.073
and we are gonna go and...

35:15.553 --> 35:17.013
We're gonna go and save the world.

35:17.113 --> 35:18.453
Sounds like a plan.

35:18.553 --> 35:23.292
But, before you start wearing your
underpants on the outside of your jeans,

35:23.392 --> 35:28.791
you're gonna throw a party
for your ungrateful 13-year-old cow.

35:31.551 --> 35:32.971
Why the change of heart?

35:33.071 --> 35:35.450
You only turn 14 once, right.

35:35.550 --> 35:36.690
Yeah.

35:36.790 --> 35:38.790
Good for you, sweetheart.

35:44.589 --> 35:47.529
Where am I supposed to find
hessian sacks this day and age?

35:47.629 --> 35:50.088
And eggs. We need at least two dozen
for the egg and spoon race.

35:50.188 --> 35:51.408
Ahh!

35:51.508 --> 35:55.047
Why couldn't you settle for
a tenpin bowling. That's retro.

35:55.147 --> 35:56.607
Oh, come on, you love it.

35:56.707 --> 35:59.727
I'd like to invite Arnold and Carol,
if you guys are cool with that.

35:59.827 --> 36:01.087
Sure, yeah! Yeah.

36:01.187 --> 36:04.106
You should ask them if they've got
any hessian sacks lying around.

36:09.545 --> 36:11.545
-[Lloyd] See you later.

36:58.138 --> 37:00.138
Oh my god, you're pregnant.

37:00.618 --> 37:02.917
What? No, no.
It's just too much chocolate.

37:03.017 --> 37:06.597
You are. That's the best news.

37:06.697 --> 37:08.757
Really? You mean that?

37:08.857 --> 37:12.216
Of course. How else was I gonna react?

37:14.216 --> 37:15.676
I dunno. Just um...

37:15.776 --> 37:17.555
wicked stepmother

37:17.655 --> 37:20.055

to start a new family.

37:22.695 --> 37:24.114
Dad doesn't know, though, does he?

37:24.214 --> 37:27.094
I'm gonna tell him today. After the party.

37:30.613 --> 37:32.613
Your secret's safe with me.

-Hey.

39:25.117 --> 39:27.816
Barney was just showing me
some security cam footage.

39:27.916 --> 39:30.296
I wanted to check the comings and goings.

39:30.396 --> 39:32.135
Anything interesting?

39:32.235 --> 39:33.495
No, not really.

39:33.595 --> 39:37.175
But you did a couple of
midnight till dawns last month.

39:37.275 --> 39:39.174
I do occasionally put in a late night.

39:39.274 --> 39:41.334
I try not to make a habit of it.
Don't want to make you look bad.

39:41.434 --> 39:44.314
Barney's gonna need
your laptop and your phone.

39:45.594 --> 39:46.693
Why?

39:46.793 --> 39:48.253
Come on, mate. Why do you think?

39:48.353 --> 39:51.033
If they didn't breach the firewall,
they might have accessed your devices.

39:56.072 --> 39:58.072
He's gonna need your second phone too,
Shay.

39:58.512 --> 40:00.511
-There's your replacement.
-Thank you.

40:04.391 --> 40:05.531
-[Barney] That's yours.
-Thanks, mate.

40:05.631 --> 40:08.090
Barney, you tell your team
that no-one goes home tonight

40:08.190 --> 40:10.670
until they figure out who stole our shit.

40:13.629 --> 40:15.629
Thanks, mate.

40:26.987 --> 40:28.967
-[Archie] There's not gonna be speeches,
dumbass.

40:29.067 --> 40:31.367
-[Francesca] Archie, if Cosmo wants to say
a few words at the party, he can.

40:31.467 --> 40:32.927
Just wait till after the candles, Cos.

40:33.027 --> 40:34.646
-[Cosmo] It's not even a speech.
It's a haiku.

40:34.746 --> 40:35.926
What is that about?

40:36.026 --> 40:38.606
-[Dom] A public park,
three hours from voltage reduction.

40:38.706 --> 40:40.045
It's a children's birthday party.

40:40.145 --> 40:42.285
It's meant to be a 5-7-5 syllable,
you idiot!

40:42.385 --> 40:43.445
Give me back my tablet.

40:43.545 --> 40:44.565
That stays in the car...

40:44.665 --> 40:46.485
-[Cosmo] He hit me!
-Guys, please!

40:46.585 --> 40:48.484
-You are so stupid!
-[Dom] I've got a haiku.

40:48.584 --> 40:51.764
Archie and Cosmo,
shut the hell up, you nuff-nuffs.

40:51.864 --> 40:53.883
Stay still and silent.

I was gonna ask you.

42:04.493 --> 42:06.913
Oh my god, look at that cake!

42:07.013 --> 42:09.512
-[Arnold] Sorry we're late.
-[Lloyd] Oh!

Many happy returns of the day.

42:22.490 --> 42:24.490
Ivy?

42:25.130 --> 42:26.830
It wasn't some random break-in.

42:26.930 --> 42:28.929
She was your granddaughter.

42:29.769 --> 42:31.229
They weren't after drugs.

42:31.329 --> 42:33.549
They were coming for revenge
because of those papers you wrote.

42:33.649 --> 42:36.028
You knew the cost
of what you were doing

42:36.128 --> 42:38.408
and you went ahead
and did it anyway!

42:39.448 --> 42:43.067
I published what I believed to be true
at the time.

42:43.167 --> 42:44.387
-[Ivy] What about now?

42:44.487 --> 42:47.927
Can you say it now, at least?
That you were wrong?

43:35.360 --> 43:37.359
Your folks didn't even show up?

43:38.559 --> 43:41.739
Mum and Dad dropped the ball with me
pretty early on.

That sucks.
