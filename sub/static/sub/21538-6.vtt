WEBVTT

00:03.470 --> 00:04.537
- PREVIOUSLY ON<i>MILLION DOLLAR</i>
<i>LISTING NEW YORK...</i>

00:04.571 --> 00:06.106
- WE'RE WAITING ON YOU,
PRINCESS.

00:06.139 --> 00:07.307
- HAVING A GIRLFRIEND IS GREAT,

00:07.340 --> 00:09.009
AS LONG AS SHE
OPERATES ON MY TERMS.

00:09.042 --> 00:10.577
- GIVING A MAKEOVER
TO THE APARTMENT

00:10.610 --> 00:11.845
MAKES ALL THE DIFFERENCE
IN THE WORLD.

00:11.878 --> 00:14.814
I JUST GOT A FULL
ASKING OFFER OF CASH.

00:14.848 --> 00:16.316
- LET'S DO IT.
[both laugh]

00:16.349 --> 00:19.886
- IT'S A WONDERFUL HOUSE.
BUILT IN 1856.

00:19.919 --> 00:21.921
- THIS IS BEDROOMS UP HERE.
[strange banging]

00:21.955 --> 00:24.324
THERE'S SOME WEIRD STUFF
GOING ON IN THIS HOUSE.

00:24.357 --> 00:25.892
OLIVIA!

00:25.925 --> 00:27.660
I HAVE TO CLEANSE
THIS HOUSE OF EVIL,

00:27.694 --> 00:29.763
SO I CAN JUST
SELL IT HAPPILY.

00:29.796 --> 00:30.764
- I'VE SEEN
A LOT OF APARTMENTS.

00:30.797 --> 00:33.166
THIS--WHOA.

00:33.199 --> 00:35.201
ZACH KNOWS A GREAT PROPERTY
WHEN HE SEES IT.

00:35.235 --> 00:37.404
- SO WE PUT IN A FULL ASK OFFER,
FULLY FURNISHED.

00:37.437 --> 00:38.438
- NO, NO.

00:38.471 --> 00:41.307
THIS IS GOING
IN THE WRONG DIRECTION.

00:41.341 --> 00:44.310
[upbeat funky music]

00:44.344 --> 00:46.112
* *

00:46.146 --> 00:49.683
- MY MOTTO IS "EXPANSION ALWAYS,
IN ALL WAYS."

00:49.716 --> 00:52.185
- NEW YORK CITY
IS THE MOST EXCITING CITY

00:52.218 --> 00:53.853
FOR REAL ESTATE,
AND THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.

00:53.887 --> 00:56.456
- I'M THE CLOSER,
AND A LISTING MACHINE.

00:56.489 --> 00:59.059
WHAT MAKES ME BETTER IS THAT
I WORK HARDER THAN ANYONE ELSE.

00:59.092 --> 01:00.193
WAAH!

01:00.226 --> 01:01.728
- I WILL BREAK YOUR TEETH.
- REACH HIGH.

01:01.761 --> 01:02.929
- CAN YOU TAKE
THIS GUY OUT OF HERE?

01:02.962 --> 01:04.064
- ARE YOU SERIOUS?

01:04.064 --> 01:05.198
- YOU'RE NOT TRYING TO HELP ME.
- WHAT?

01:05.231 --> 01:08.134
- YOU WANT TO CONTROL ME.

01:18.445 --> 01:21.514
- MY TOWNHOUSE LISTING
IN MURRAY HILL HAS BEEN...

01:21.548 --> 01:23.650
INTERESTING.

01:23.683 --> 01:26.086
SOME MIGHT SAY "OTHERWORLDLY."

01:26.086 --> 01:29.622
PATRICIA, THE OWNER,
HAS ALREADY MOVED TO FLORIDA,

01:29.656 --> 01:32.092
AND THE HOUSE
FEELS PRETTY EMPTY.

01:32.092 --> 01:35.328
DURING MY LISTING APPOINTMENT,
I NOTICED SOME STRANGE THINGS.

01:35.362 --> 01:37.230
ODD NOISES, THE BEDROOM
WAS UNNERVINGLY COLD,

01:37.263 --> 01:39.299
AND THE BASEMENT...

01:39.332 --> 01:41.868
NO, THANK YOU.

01:41.901 --> 01:44.104
THINGS DID NOT IMPROVE
DURING THE OPEN HOUSE.

01:44.104 --> 01:47.107
[squeaking]
- [gasps]

01:47.140 --> 01:49.109
- SO I KNEW
I HAD TO DO SOMETHING.

01:49.109 --> 01:51.177
- ANYTHING NEGATIVE
IS JUST SORT OF BANISHED.

01:51.211 --> 01:52.379
- ACCORDING TO THE PSYCHICS,

01:52.412 --> 01:55.015
THE HOUSE HAS BEEN REMOVED
OF ALL BAD ENERGY.

01:55.115 --> 01:56.750
- HELLO.
- HI.

01:56.783 --> 01:58.618
- HOW ARE YOU?

01:58.651 --> 01:59.719
AND IT BETTER BE, BECAUSE I HAVE
MULTIPLE SHOWINGS LINED UP.

01:59.753 --> 02:02.055
SO THIS IS YOUR MAIN
LIVING ROOM SPACE.

02:02.055 --> 02:03.490
- THE FIRST FLOOR,
IT'S BRIGHT FOR THE FIRST FLOOR.

02:03.523 --> 02:05.558
- YEAH.
IT'S PLENTY OF LIGHT.

02:05.592 --> 02:07.527
- YOU GOT A GOOD VIBE IN HERE.

02:07.560 --> 02:09.462
THE ENERGY'S GOOD IN THIS HOUSE.
YOU FEEL, IT FEELS GOOD, RIGHT?

02:09.496 --> 02:11.364
- YEAH...

02:11.398 --> 02:13.500
- I KNOW I'M BEING
A LITTLE PARANOID,

02:13.533 --> 02:15.835
BUT BECAUSE OF MY PREVIOUS
EXPERIENCE IN THIS HOUSE,

02:15.869 --> 02:17.804
I CAN'T HELP BUT FEEL
THAT SOMETHING WEIRD

02:17.837 --> 02:19.839
MIGHT HAPPEN ANY SECOND.

02:19.873 --> 02:21.241
YOU'RE OKAY TAKING
THE STAIRS FOR NOW?

02:21.274 --> 02:23.376
- MM-HMM. YEAH.
- OKAY.

02:23.410 --> 02:26.546
SO THIS IS THE MASTER BEDROOM.

02:26.579 --> 02:28.448
- IT'S HOT IN HERE. [chuckles]
- YEAH?

02:28.481 --> 02:30.216
- IT'S REALLY COLD IN HERE.
IS THERE HEAT?

02:30.250 --> 02:32.252
- IT'S AT 80.

02:32.285 --> 02:34.921
- YEAH, NO.
THAT WOULD BE CRAZY.

02:34.954 --> 02:36.956
- DON'T YOU FEEL LIKE
THIS HAS REALLY GOOD ENERGY?

02:36.990 --> 02:38.291
- YEAH, IT'S GOOD.
YEAH, YEAH.

02:38.324 --> 02:39.759
- IT'S A GOOD SIZE.
THIS IS A REALLY BIG BED.

02:39.793 --> 02:41.294
I COULD SEE YOU IN THIS BED.

02:41.327 --> 02:42.429
[laughter]

02:42.462 --> 02:43.997
- I MIGHT GET IN IT RIGHT NOW.

02:44.097 --> 02:46.633
- MAYBE THIS PLACE
IS FREE OF ALL THE BAD JUJU.

02:46.666 --> 02:48.435
IN HERE,
THIS IS MY FAVORITE ROOM.

02:48.468 --> 02:50.103
- THIS IS BEAUTIFUL.
- YEAH, THIS IS GREAT.

02:50.136 --> 02:52.572
- THESE ARE THE ORIGINAL FRENCH
DOORS, AND THESE ARE LANDMARK.

02:52.605 --> 02:54.341
- THIS HARDWARE IS FANTASTIC.

02:54.374 --> 02:56.509
- YEAH, AND IT'S
CENTURY-OLD HARDWARE.

02:56.543 --> 02:57.510
- YEAH, IT'S REALLY,
REALLY NICE.

02:57.544 --> 02:58.678
REALLY, REALLY NICE.

02:58.712 --> 03:02.048
- FEEL GOOD SO FAR? FEEL HAPPY?
- YEAH. HAPPY.

03:02.048 --> 03:03.049
THIS IS REALLY COOL.

03:03.049 --> 03:04.451
I LIKE THIS HOUSE
A LOT MORE NOW,

03:04.484 --> 03:06.252
IN THIS SHOWING THAN
I'VE EVER LIKED IT BEFORE.

03:06.286 --> 03:09.255
[upbeat music]

03:09.289 --> 03:10.957
* *

03:11.057 --> 03:14.060
- MY NEW LISTING
AT 101 WARREN HAS BEEN CRAZY.

03:14.060 --> 03:15.862
THIS PENTHOUSE
IS ONE OF THE MOST

03:15.895 --> 03:19.432
VISUALLY STUNNING APARTMENTS
I HAVE EVER SEEN.

03:19.466 --> 03:22.402
- WE LIST IT AT 11,
THE FURNITURE SEPARATE,

03:22.435 --> 03:23.403
THAT WOULD MAKE US HAPPY.

03:23.436 --> 03:24.704
- WELL, I WANT
TO MAKE YOU HAPPY.

03:24.738 --> 03:26.506
AND AS SOON AS I SNAPPED
SOME PHOTOS OF THE LISTING...

03:26.539 --> 03:28.608
THIS ONE IS FOR FACEBOOK.
SNAP.

03:28.641 --> 03:30.910
ONE OF MY BIGGEST CLIENTS,
ZACH VELLA,

03:30.944 --> 03:33.079
PUT IN A FULL ASK OFFER,
$11 MILLION.

03:33.113 --> 03:35.081
- I THINK THIS MAKES SENSE
AS AN INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITY.

03:35.081 --> 03:37.117
- INCLUDING THE FURNITURE,

03:37.150 --> 03:39.986
AND THAT'S A PROBLEM
FOR MY SELLER ZEKE.

03:40.086 --> 03:41.621
- WE TALKED ABOUT THIS.

03:41.654 --> 03:42.989
11 MILLION
WITHOUT THE FURNITURE,

03:43.089 --> 03:45.725
THAT'S WHERE WE HAVE TO BE.

03:45.759 --> 03:47.394
- I'M STUCK IN THE MIDDLE HERE,

03:47.427 --> 03:51.131
BECAUSE ZACH IS MY
LONG TIME NUMBER ONE CLIENT,

03:51.164 --> 03:53.199
AND THEN ZEKE IS MY
NEW FAVORITE CLIENT,

03:53.233 --> 03:55.135
BUT I NEED TO BE FAIR TO BOTH,

03:55.168 --> 03:57.470
AND THAT'S NOT
GONNA BE EASY HERE.

03:57.504 --> 04:01.074
BUT YOU DO HAVE TO AGREE
WITH ME THAT $11 MILLION

04:01.107 --> 04:03.576
INCLUDING THE FURNITURE
IS AN AMAZING OFFER.

04:03.610 --> 04:06.312
- I'M EXCITED ABOUT THE
11 MILLION, BUT YOU AND I AGREED

04:06.346 --> 04:08.248
THAT WE'RE GOING TO
KEEP THE FURNITURE SEPARATE.

04:08.281 --> 04:10.216
WE SPENT OVER $1 MILLION
ON THAT APARTMENT.

04:10.250 --> 04:12.218
CUSTOM RUGS, THE LIGHTING.

04:12.252 --> 04:13.753
- THE $1 MILLION
THAT YOU PUT IN,

04:13.787 --> 04:14.954
IT'S NOT WORTH $1 MILLION.

04:15.055 --> 04:16.589
THIS SUIT WAS $2,000.
IT WAS CUSTOM.

04:16.623 --> 04:17.590
IT DOESN'T EVEN FIT YOU.

04:17.624 --> 04:18.591
YOU SEE WHAT I'M SAYING?

04:18.625 --> 04:19.959
THERE'S NO WAY IN HELL

04:20.060 --> 04:21.127
ANYONE'S GONNA PAY
$1 MILLION FOR THAT FURNITURE.

04:21.161 --> 04:22.929
THE APARTMENT'S FURNITURE
IS GORGEOUS.

04:22.962 --> 04:25.565
IT REALLY IS, BUT IT'S,
LIKE, TWO YEARS OLD.

04:25.598 --> 04:29.069
IT'S NOT NEW, SO I THINK
HE'S OVERVALUING AT THIS POINT,

04:29.069 --> 04:31.237
AND THE EXPENSE COULD
BE THE ENTIRE DEAL.

04:31.271 --> 04:32.872
HE'S LOSING
THE BIGGER PICTURE HERE.

04:32.906 --> 04:34.107
IT REALLY SCARES ME.

04:34.140 --> 04:35.909
I'VE SEEN SO MANY DEALS
FALL THROUGH

04:35.942 --> 04:38.545
BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE
FIGHTING OVER A DAMN SOFA.

04:38.578 --> 04:40.747
- I THINK WE DECIDED ON 11
MILLION WITHOUT THE FURNITURE,

04:40.780 --> 04:43.850
AND THAT'S HOW
WE SHOULD KEEP IT.

04:43.883 --> 04:45.251
- OKAY, OKAY, OKAY.
OKAY, OKAY.

04:45.285 --> 04:49.089
LET ME GO BACK, AND LET ME TELL
HIM THAT IF HE WANTS IT,

04:49.122 --> 04:53.893
HE HAS TO PAY FULL ASK, 11
MILLION, WITHOUT ANY FURNITURE,

04:53.927 --> 04:55.462
AND THEN I'M GONNA QUICKLY
DO AN INVENTORY LIST,

04:55.495 --> 04:58.665
BECAUSE I HAVE TO UNDERSTAND,
WHAT IS THAT SOFA WORTH?

04:58.698 --> 05:01.301
I DON'T KNOW, AND I'M GONNA
TRY TO PRICE IT OUT RETAIL.

05:01.334 --> 05:02.769
YOU GUYS ARE GONNA HAVE TO
MEET SOMEWHERE IN THE MIDDLE,

05:02.802 --> 05:06.039
AND WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO TRY
TO MAKE THIS WORK TOGETHER.

05:06.039 --> 05:07.207
WE'RE NOT GONNA
NEGOTIATE ON THE APARTMENT,

05:07.240 --> 05:09.242
BUT WE'RE GONNA
NEGOTIATE ON THE FURNITURE,

05:09.275 --> 05:10.610
AND THEN I'M GONNA
GET YOU YOUR 11 MILLION

05:10.643 --> 05:13.146
FOR THE APARTMENT ALONE.
- THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO HEAR.

05:13.179 --> 05:15.281
- I'VE GOT TO SALVAGE THIS DEAL.

05:15.315 --> 05:18.818
THE CHANCE OF GETTING ANOTHER
FULL ASK OFFER IS KIND OF SLIM,

05:18.852 --> 05:21.588
AND I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH LONGER
ZACH IS GONNA KEEP HIS PATIENCE.

05:21.621 --> 05:24.224
- TICK-TOCK, FREDDY.

05:24.257 --> 05:27.227
[upbeat pop music]

05:27.260 --> 05:30.263
* *

05:30.296 --> 05:33.366
[elevator dings]
- OKAY.

05:33.400 --> 05:35.735
DON'T GET SCARED.
- I AM NOT.

05:35.769 --> 05:37.437
- NO SEXUAL FAVORS.
- HELLO. HOW ARE YOU?

05:37.470 --> 05:38.838
- SONJA MORGAN IS
A VERY GOOD FRIEND OF MINE.

05:38.872 --> 05:42.776
SHE IS VERY CRAZY, AND SHE
KNOWS EVERYONE IN NEW YORK.

05:42.809 --> 05:44.944
- WHERE CAN I HIDE THIS COAT?
WHERE ARE THE DRAG QUEENS?

05:44.978 --> 05:46.413
I THOUGHT THIS WAS
A DRAG QUEEN PARTY.

05:46.446 --> 05:48.415
DID YOU LIE TO ME
TO GET ME OVER HERE?

05:48.448 --> 05:51.084
- TONIGHT SONJA HAS INVITED ME
TO HER FRIEND'S TALENT SHOW.

05:51.117 --> 05:53.253
- WHERE'S IAN?
- HE'S SOMEWHERE AROUND.

05:53.286 --> 05:55.455
- THE HOST OF THE PARTY
IS IAN REISNER.

05:55.488 --> 05:56.890
IT'S ONE OF THE BIGGEST
DEVELOPERS IN THE CITY.

05:56.923 --> 06:00.193
HE OWNS 25 UNITS
AT 230 CENTRAL PARK SOUTH,

06:00.226 --> 06:02.028
ONE OF THE BEST ADDRESSES
IN NEW YORK CITY,

06:02.028 --> 06:04.397
AND I'M HOPING THAT
I CAN GET A LISTING FROM HIM.

06:04.431 --> 06:06.032
- BOYS, COME AND SAY HI TO LUIS.
- YOUR DRESS IS GORGEOUS.

06:06.032 --> 06:07.500
- HOW ARE YOU?
- THANK YOU.

06:07.534 --> 06:08.868
I THOUGHT THIS WAS
A DRAG QUEEN PARTY.

06:08.902 --> 06:10.236
I GUESS I'M
THE ONLY ONE THAT...

06:10.270 --> 06:12.772
WHERE'S IAN? DO YOU KNOW?

06:12.806 --> 06:15.308
- IAN! OH, MY GOSH!
- YOU'RE BACK IN TOWN?

06:15.342 --> 06:16.843
HOW ARE YOU?
- LOOK AT YOU!

06:16.876 --> 06:18.611
- I WANT YOU TO MEET
MY FRIEND LUIS ORTIZ.

06:18.645 --> 06:19.879
HE'S IN REAL ESTATE.

06:19.913 --> 06:21.548
- I DO REAL ESTATE 9:00 TO 5:00,
NOT 5:00 TO 9:00.

06:21.581 --> 06:22.615
- THAT'S TRUE.

06:22.649 --> 06:23.950
- LISTEN,
HE LOOKS LIKE HE COULD BE

06:24.050 --> 06:26.152
RICKY RICARDO'S YOUNGER BROTHER
FROM ANOTHER MOTHER.

06:26.186 --> 06:27.187
LOOK AT THIS.

06:27.220 --> 06:28.955
- RICKY RICARDO'S
YOUNGER BROTHER?

06:29.055 --> 06:30.957
WHO THE [bleep]
IS RICKY RICARDO?

06:31.057 --> 06:32.125
- YOU KNOW LUCIE ARNAZ?

06:32.158 --> 06:33.960
- I DON'T.
- THE DAUGHTER OF LUCILLE BALL?

06:34.060 --> 06:34.961
- NO.
- COME ON.

06:35.061 --> 06:36.329
- THAT WOULD BE
A PERFECT DATE FOR YOU.

06:36.363 --> 06:39.099
IF YOU'RE REALLY STRAIGHT.
- I AM VERY STRAIGHT.

06:39.132 --> 06:40.266
- TRY IT.
- WE COULD MAKE YOU SING.

06:40.300 --> 06:42.535
- YOU COULD DEFINITELY
MAKE HIM SING.

06:42.569 --> 06:44.137
- OH, REALLY?

06:44.170 --> 06:45.905
- I LIKE WOMEN VERY MUCH.

06:45.939 --> 06:48.808
- WELL, MAYBE WE CAN CHANGE HIM?
- NO, HE'S MILKING IT HERE.

06:48.842 --> 06:51.644
- OH, MY GOD, LOOK HOW RED.
- LOOK AT THAT.

06:51.678 --> 06:52.679
- OH, MY GOD!

06:52.712 --> 06:53.847
- IF IT'S A WOMAN,
BISEXUAL.

06:53.880 --> 06:57.183
- THESE PEOPLE ARE NUTS.
[laughs]

06:57.217 --> 06:58.752
- SO YOU KNOW THIS IS
MY ANNUAL TALENT SHOW.

06:58.785 --> 07:01.521
WE HAVE TREVOR,
WHO'S AN AMAZING PIANIST,

07:01.554 --> 07:02.655
IN THE CORNER BACK THERE--

07:02.689 --> 07:04.391
- AMAZING PENIS?

07:04.424 --> 07:06.860
- PIANIST, YOU SLUT!

07:06.893 --> 07:10.063
- [laughing]
NO ONE'S SLUTTIER THAN YOU.

07:10.096 --> 07:11.464
- HEY, GUYS, LET'S ALL GO

07:11.498 --> 07:13.833
INTO THE LIVING ROOM
AND WATCH THE TALENT SHOW.

07:13.867 --> 07:15.101
- HERE, SIT HERE.

07:15.135 --> 07:16.503
- RICKY, RICKY, GET OVER HERE.

07:16.536 --> 07:17.937
- JESUS, ALL RIGHT.

07:18.038 --> 07:19.039
- RICKY RICARDO, COME HERE.
GET OVER HERE.

07:19.039 --> 07:21.174
YOU KNOW, I'LL TELL YOU,
THIS NEW GUY

07:21.207 --> 07:23.209
I JUST MET TONIGHT
HAPPENS TO BE A DRAG QUEEN,

07:23.243 --> 07:26.146
AND HE BROUGHT WITH HIM,
HIS FAVORITE DRAG WIG.

07:26.179 --> 07:27.480
- OH, COME ON! I DID NOT--

07:27.514 --> 07:31.551
- OH, HE'S A LITTLE NERVOUS.
LET'S JUST...

07:31.584 --> 07:33.119
- YOU GO THROUGH CRAZY THINGS
TO TRY TO GET LISTINGS,

07:33.153 --> 07:35.789
BUT MOST OF THEM
ARE PROFESSIONAL.

07:35.822 --> 07:38.324
- YOU'RE GONNA RUIN
HIS RICKY RICARDO HAIR.

07:38.358 --> 07:39.659
- DON'T TOUCH THE HAIR.

07:39.693 --> 07:41.094
- SONJA,
JUST BECAUSE I LOVE YOU.

07:41.127 --> 07:42.362
[bleep] IT.

07:42.395 --> 07:43.630
IF I'M GOING TO EARN
THIS GUY'S TRUST,

07:43.663 --> 07:45.765
I THINK THIS IS THE ONLY WAY.

07:45.799 --> 07:48.735

08:16.730 --> 08:17.697
YURI, I'VE BEEN TRYING
TO CALL PATRICIA,

08:17.731 --> 08:20.400
AND CANNOT GET AHOLD OF HER.

08:20.433 --> 08:22.369
NOW THAT ALL THE BAD ENERGY
HAS LEFT MY TOWNHOUSE LISTING,

08:22.402 --> 08:23.837
I HAVE BEEN SHOWING
THERE NON-STOP.

08:23.870 --> 08:26.606
THE STRUCTURE IS VERY SOLID.

08:26.639 --> 08:28.241
IT'S A GOOD, GOOD HOME.

08:28.274 --> 08:29.776
ON TO THE BACK,
YOU HAVE TWO CLOSETS HERE.

08:29.809 --> 08:31.177
- I LIKE THIS A LOT.

08:31.211 --> 08:34.881
- AND I WAS ABLE TO GET
ONE OF THE BROKERS, TOM,

08:34.914 --> 08:36.683
TO MAKE AN OFFER,
BUT I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE

08:36.716 --> 08:38.318
TO GET AHOLD OF PATRICIA.

08:38.351 --> 08:41.221
SHE DOESN'T HAVE A CELL PHONE.
SHE DOESN'T HAVE E-MAIL.

08:41.254 --> 08:43.189
SHE'S NOT EVEN HERE.
IN FLORIDA.

08:43.223 --> 08:45.725
OKAY, LET'S TRY HER AGAIN.

08:45.759 --> 08:48.294
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO,
CALL THE PONY EXPRESS?

08:48.328 --> 08:50.530
[phone line ringing]

08:50.563 --> 08:53.266
- OH, MAN, IF THE GODS LOVE ME,
PATRICIA WILL PICK UP,

08:53.299 --> 08:54.567
AND I CAN GET HER
TO ACCEPT THIS OFFER.

08:54.601 --> 08:56.069
- HELLO?

08:56.069 --> 09:00.373
- HI, PATRICIA. IT'S RYAN.

09:00.407 --> 09:01.441
- I AM GOOD.

09:01.474 --> 09:03.543
I HAVE SOME
VERY GOOD NEWS FOR YOU.

09:03.576 --> 09:05.345
- OH, TELL ME.

09:05.378 --> 09:08.448
- I'VE GOT AN OFFER
ON THE HOUSE.

09:08.481 --> 09:11.017
3,750,000.

09:17.257 --> 09:21.294
I REALIZE, BUT IT'S STILL
A VERY GOOD NUMBER.

09:25.932 --> 09:28.735
YEAH, OKAY,
SO HERE'S WHAT I WANT TO DO.

09:28.768 --> 09:30.470
I THINK WE SHOULD
SEND THEM A CONTRACT,

09:30.503 --> 09:33.740
SO AT LEAST YOU HAVE A CONTRACT,
SO YOU KNOW THAT NO MATTER WHAT,

09:33.773 --> 09:35.742
LET'S SAY THE MARKET
FALLS OUT TOMORROW,

09:35.775 --> 09:37.143
YOU'LL AT LEAST HAVE
A CONTRACT FOR 3.75.

09:37.177 --> 09:40.413
TOM'S OFFER IS GOOD,
SO I DON'T WANT TO LOSE IT,

09:40.447 --> 09:43.049
AND I'M GONNA
GET A CONTRACT OUT,

09:43.049 --> 09:46.319
BUT A CONTRACT OUT
DOESN'T MEAN A CONTRACT SIGNED,

09:46.353 --> 09:48.955
SO I'M GONNA DO
EVERYTHING I POSSIBLY CAN

09:49.055 --> 09:51.758
TO GET A BETTER OFFER,
BUT I'M GONNA USE THAT CONTRACT.

09:51.791 --> 09:54.427
I'M GONNA CALL EVERYONE THAT'S
SEEN THE HOUSE, AND MY GOAL

09:54.461 --> 09:58.665
IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS IS TO
BRING YOU AN EVEN BETTER DEAL.

10:00.567 --> 10:04.371
I'M A--I CAN'T HEAR YOU.
I'M A G-WHAT?

WITH EVEN BETTER NEWS, OKAY?

10:10.443 --> 10:11.411
ALL RIGHT, THANKS.

10:11.444 --> 10:13.646

YES!

10:16.016 --> 10:17.117
- COMING UP...

10:17.150 --> 10:19.819
- WOW.
THIS APARTMENT IS BEAUTIFUL,

10:19.853 --> 10:21.454
AND I WILL DO WHATEVER
IT TAKES TO GET IT.

10:21.488 --> 10:23.023
- SO HANDSOME, YOU COULD BE GAY.

10:23.056 --> 10:24.924

10:34.634 --> 10:36.770
- OKAY, SO THIS IS IT.

10:36.803 --> 10:41.641
WE NEED TO ITEMIZE
EVERYTHING IN THIS APARTMENT.

10:41.675 --> 10:44.310
AFTER I MET WITH ZEKE,
AND HE REJECTED ZACH'S OFFER,

10:44.344 --> 10:45.979
I CALLED ZACH TO LET HIM KNOW.

10:46.012 --> 10:48.148
IT'S GONNA BE 11 MILLION,
PLUS MONEY FOR THE FURNITURE.

10:48.181 --> 10:49.616
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THAT NUMBER IS YET.

10:49.649 --> 10:53.687
I'M GONNA GO TO THE APARTMENT
AND DO AN INVENTORY LIST.

10:56.056 --> 10:58.124
OKAY, LET ME DO MY THING.
I'LL LET YOU KNOW.

10:58.158 --> 11:00.760
SO NOW, JORDAN AND I
WILL NEED TO PIN DOWN

11:00.794 --> 11:03.129
THE EXACT RETAIL VALUE
OF THIS FURNITURE

11:03.163 --> 11:05.231
IN ORDER TO SAVE
THIS ENTIRE TRANSACTION.

11:05.265 --> 11:06.966
OKAY, CHANDELIER.

11:07.067 --> 11:09.602
IT'S VERY EXPENSIVE,
AND THEN WE HAVE THIS ONE.

11:09.636 --> 11:11.938
SO WE HAVE, LIKE,
A COUPLE OF HUNDRED THOUSAND

11:11.971 --> 11:13.073
JUST IN THESE,
BUT THAT'S A BIG NUMBER.

11:13.106 --> 11:14.607
I NEED THE EXACT,
AND LOOK AROUND.

11:14.641 --> 11:17.444
I MEAN, YOU SEE THE QUALITY
OF THIS FURNITURE.

11:17.477 --> 11:18.778
I MEAN, IT'S JUST UNBELIEVABLE.

11:18.812 --> 11:21.147
WE HAVE TO FIND OUT
EXACTLY WHAT THIS TABLE IS,

11:21.181 --> 11:22.882
AND THEN THESE TABLE CHAIRS.

11:22.916 --> 11:24.150
I NEED THE EXACT NUMBER.

11:24.184 --> 11:25.819
I THINK WE SHOULD
BUILD A DATABASE

11:25.852 --> 11:27.887
AND INPUT ALL THESE DATA.

11:27.921 --> 11:28.888
SEE, THIS IS WHAT WE DO.
IT HAS TO BE PERFECT.

11:28.922 --> 11:30.890
PUT THAT ON YOUR GRAVESTONE.

11:30.924 --> 11:32.225
LET'S MOVE TO THE CARPETS.

11:32.258 --> 11:33.693
I WANT TO KNOW THE SIZES
OF EACH CARPET.

11:33.727 --> 11:35.562
- IT SAYS "SQUARE METER."

11:35.595 --> 11:37.664
- OH, FINALLY,
SOMEONE USING SQUARE METERS.

11:37.697 --> 11:39.799
- WHAT IS A METER?

11:39.833 --> 11:41.368
- OKAY, WRITE THIS DOWN.

11:41.401 --> 11:43.103

FITTED SHEET, FLAT SHEET, SHAMS,
PILLOW CASES, KING PILLOWS.

11:49.509 --> 11:51.011
I NEED THE EXACT PRICE
ON EVERYTHING.

11:51.111 --> 11:53.279
WHAT I WANT JORDAN
TO UNDERSTAND IS THAT

11:53.313 --> 11:55.782
THE DEVIL IS IN THE DETAILS,
AND IN THIS DEAL,

11:55.815 --> 11:57.017
THERE ARE A LOT OF DETAILS.

11:57.117 --> 11:59.519
OKAY, ON THAT NOTE,
I HAVE TO LEAVE.

11:59.552 --> 12:00.920
- WHAT--WHAT ARE YOU DO--
WHY?

12:00.954 --> 12:03.189

17:12.399 --> 17:14.534
- YEAH, STRAIGHT TO MY BED.

17:14.567 --> 17:16.436
- OH, MY GOD!

17:16.469 --> 17:18.071
- LISTEN,
IF YOU REALLY ARE PUERTO RICAN,

17:18.104 --> 17:20.473
YOU'RE PROBABLY BISEXUAL.
- NO.

17:20.507 --> 17:22.876
- THE MORE I BUY YOU, THE MORE
YOU'LL BE SEXUAL FOR ME.

17:22.909 --> 17:24.644
- JESUS, MAN.

17:24.678 --> 17:25.812
- YOU'RE A BROKER.
YOU'LL SELL ANYTHING.

17:25.845 --> 17:26.846
- I WILL NOT, BUT I WILL SELL

17:26.880 --> 17:28.148
THIS APARTMENT
FOR THE RIGHT PRICE.

17:28.181 --> 17:29.649
- YOU CAN'T SELL THIS APARTMENT.
THIS ONE IS SOLD.

17:29.683 --> 17:31.518
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

17:31.551 --> 17:33.053
- I JUST SOLD THIS APARTMENT.
IT'S IN CONTRACT.

17:33.053 --> 17:35.488
I'M JUST SHOWING YOU
MY WORKMANSHIP IN THE BUILDING,

17:35.522 --> 17:38.058
THAT'S ALL.
- SO THIS APARTMENT IS SOLD?

17:38.091 --> 17:39.626
- THIS APARTMENT,
UNFORTUNATELY, IS SOLD.

17:39.659 --> 17:42.696
I BROUGHT YOU HERE
BECAUSE I THOUGHT THAT YOU MIGHT

17:42.729 --> 17:45.598
BE ABLE TO HELP ME
SELL A DERELICT APARTMENT

17:45.632 --> 17:47.367
THAT I'M CREATING
ON THE 11th FLOOR.

17:47.400 --> 17:50.570
- A DERELICT APARTMENT?
"A DEREK-LICKED, LICKED"...

17:50.603 --> 17:52.539
SOMEBODY NAMED DEREK
LICKED THE APARTMENT?

17:52.572 --> 17:56.242
- I'VE ACCUMULATED FOUR UNITS.
11 A, B, C, AND F.

17:56.276 --> 17:59.079
AND I WANT TO COMBINE THEM INTO
32,000 SQUARE FOOT FOUR BEDROOM,

17:59.079 --> 18:01.881
FOUR BATH, BEAUTIFUL HOME
JUST LIKE THIS.

18:01.915 --> 18:03.583
IT'S GONNA BE
IN THE SAME CONDITION.

18:03.616 --> 18:05.852
I'M GONNA USE--MOST OF
THE AESTHETIC OF THIS APARTMENT

18:05.885 --> 18:09.289
WILL END UP ON THE 11th FLOOR.

18:09.322 --> 18:12.192
- I REALLY WASN'T EXPECTING
THIS, BUT, YOU KNOW,

18:12.225 --> 18:13.727
HEARING IAN'S VISION ABOUT
THE POTENTIAL OF THIS PLACE

18:13.760 --> 18:15.028
IS REALLY GETTING ME EXCITED.

18:15.061 --> 18:17.030
- LET'S GO.
I'M GONNA SHOW YOU THIS STUFF.

18:17.030 --> 18:18.231
- I CAN SEE THAT
IAN DOES GREAT WORK,

18:18.264 --> 18:21.034
AND THE OPPORTUNITY
TO BE ABLE TO WORK ON

18:21.067 --> 18:22.102
A HIGH-END PROJECT LIKE THIS...

18:22.135 --> 18:23.436
- COME ON IN.

18:23.470 --> 18:25.105
- IT COULD BE GREAT
FOR MY CAREER.

18:25.138 --> 18:26.106
HOLY SH...

18:26.139 --> 18:29.075
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

18:29.109 --> 18:30.443
- COMING UP...

18:30.477 --> 18:32.045
- OH, THAT'S MY DOGGY, ROSSY!

18:32.078 --> 18:33.413
- THE MORE TIME
I SPEND WITH IAN...

18:33.446 --> 18:35.849
- DAMN IT!
- DOG IS PEEING IN THE FLOOR!

18:35.882 --> 18:36.850
HE IS GENUINELY CRAZY.

18:36.883 --> 18:37.884
OH, MY GOD, NO!
- [smooching]

18:42.055 --> 18:45.058
[funky music]

18:45.058 --> 18:46.292
* *

18:46.326 --> 18:49.162
- COME ON IN.

18:49.195 --> 18:50.430
- HOLY SH...

18:50.463 --> 18:52.532
- SO THIS IS AN EXAMPLE
OF WHAT APARTMENTS LOOK LIKE

18:52.565 --> 18:54.734
WHEN A WOMAN THAT'S BEEN HERE
SINCE THE 1950s MOVES OUT,

18:54.768 --> 18:58.471
AND I BASICALLY START WITH HELL.

18:58.505 --> 19:00.507
- HOLY [bleep].

19:00.540 --> 19:02.742
- WHEN I SHOW YOU THIS BATHROOM,
JUST GET READY.

19:02.776 --> 19:05.912
THERE'S MONKEYS CLIMBING
OFF OF THE WALLPAPER.

19:08.081 --> 19:09.849
I MEAN, THIS WAS
THE HOTTEST [bleep].

19:09.883 --> 19:11.317
- THIS USED TO BE COOL
BACK IN THE '50s?

19:11.351 --> 19:13.086
- I DON'T KNOW, WHEN YOUR
GRANDPARENT RICKY RICARDO

19:13.119 --> 19:14.621
WAS LIVING HERE
IT WAS PROBABLY COOL.

19:14.654 --> 19:16.022
- ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

19:16.022 --> 19:18.558
I CAN'T EVEN BELIEVE THIS PLACE
IS IN THE SAME BUILDING.

19:18.591 --> 19:20.093
- I MEAN, I APOLOGIZE
FOR THE SMELL.

19:20.126 --> 19:21.728
SOME GRANDMOTHER DIED HERE.
I DON'T KNOW.

19:23.763 --> 19:25.598
RICKY, COME ON IN HERE.

19:25.632 --> 19:27.033
THIS IS THE FINEST<i>BRADY BUNCH</i>
KITCHEN THAT EXISTS.

19:27.067 --> 19:28.568
DESIGNED IN THE 1960s.

19:28.601 --> 19:30.136
NOTHING WILL STAY.

19:30.170 --> 19:32.172
NOT THE MICE,
NOT THE DISGUSTING CABINETS.

19:32.205 --> 19:34.541
- SEE, AT LEAST
YOU LOOK AT CENTRAL PARK.

19:34.574 --> 19:36.242
- SO THAT WAS 11B.

19:36.276 --> 19:37.877
LET ME SHOW YOU
THE 11A AND THE 11F.

19:37.911 --> 19:40.046
HERE YOU GO.

19:40.046 --> 19:42.082
THIS ONE WAS RENOVATED
PROBABLY 20 YEARS AGO.

19:42.115 --> 19:46.086
THIS'LL END UP BEING
A 15x16-FOOT KITCHEN HERE.

19:46.119 --> 19:47.754
EVEN THOUGH YOU DON'T
FACE THE PARK,

19:47.787 --> 19:50.557
YOU GET A NICE, SUNNY VIEW.

19:50.590 --> 19:52.292
THIS'LL BE THE GUEST SUITE,

19:52.325 --> 19:55.362
SO YOU CAN SEE
THE PROPORTIONS ARE GREAT.

19:55.395 --> 19:58.431
LET ME SHOW YOU WHAT
THIS APARTMENT'S REALLY ABOUT.

19:58.465 --> 19:59.833
- OH, THE VIEW.

19:59.866 --> 20:00.934
- HELLO.
- HEY, CHRIS, HOW ARE YOU?

20:00.967 --> 20:01.935
- VERY GOOD. HOW YOU DOING?

20:01.968 --> 20:03.103
- THIS IS ACTUALLY A TENANT

20:03.136 --> 20:04.237
THAT'S BEEN LIVING HERE
UNTIL I RENOVATE.

20:04.270 --> 20:05.238
- LUIS, NICE TO MEET YOU.
- RICKY RICARDO.

20:05.271 --> 20:06.840
- A PLEASURE. YOU LIVE HERE?

20:06.873 --> 20:08.141
- YEAH, I LIVE HERE.
YEAH.

20:08.174 --> 20:09.209
- HE'S GOT AN AIR MATTRESS.

20:09.242 --> 20:10.210
HE THINKS THIS IS
LIKE A DORMITORY.

20:10.243 --> 20:11.277
I DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS, BUT...

20:11.311 --> 20:13.713
- WHAT AM I,
IN THE<i>TWILIGHT ZONE?</i>

20:13.747 --> 20:16.182
WHAT THE [bleep]
IS GOING ON HERE?

20:16.216 --> 20:18.084
- HE WILL MOVE OUT
BEFORE WE START DEMO, TRUST ME.

20:18.118 --> 20:19.419
- OKAY.
- NICE TO SEE YOU.

20:19.452 --> 20:21.121
I'M SORRY WE DISTURBED YOU.
- NO, NO PROBLEM AT ALL.

20:21.154 --> 20:22.722
- COME TO XL TONIGHT.
WE'LL HAVE FUN.

20:22.756 --> 20:24.124
- DEFINITELY, DEFINITELY.
- ALL RIGHT, SEE YOU THERE.

20:24.157 --> 20:25.125
BYE.
- ALL RIGHT.

20:25.158 --> 20:27.527
JESUS. OH, MY GOD.

20:27.560 --> 20:29.229
- SO LOOK AT THE VIEW.
LET'S FOCUS ON THE VIEW.

20:29.262 --> 20:31.131
- YES.
THIS IS THE MONEY RIGHT HERE.

20:31.164 --> 20:33.033
- OH, THAT'S MY DOGGY, ROSSY.

20:33.066 --> 20:34.034
THAT'S MY NEW PUPPY.

20:34.067 --> 20:35.335
OH, COME HERE, LITTLE BABY.

20:35.368 --> 20:36.703
- PEE. TAKE A [bleep].
- SO WHEN I SELL THE APARTMENTS,

20:36.736 --> 20:37.971
- I USUALLY--
- THERE YOU GO.

20:38.004 --> 20:39.606
THERE HE IS.
- ROSSY, YOU CAN'T PEE ON MY--

20:39.639 --> 20:42.442
- THERE HE IS!
DOG IS PEEING IN THE FLOOR!

20:42.475 --> 20:43.910
- RAH, RAH, RAH, RAH, RAH!

20:43.943 --> 20:46.112
- WOW, SHE REALLY THINKS
IT'S CENTRAL PARK.

20:46.146 --> 20:48.281
OH, MY GOD! NO.

20:48.314 --> 20:49.416
- WANT TO POO POO TOO?

20:49.449 --> 20:51.384
COME ON.
POO POO, POO POO.

20:51.418 --> 20:53.019
- THE MORE TIME
I SPEND WITH IAN,

20:53.053 --> 20:55.655
THE MORE I UNDERSTAND
THAT HE IS GENUINELY CRAZY.

20:55.689 --> 20:56.923
[upbeat funky music]

20:56.956 --> 20:59.893
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S TALK.
SERIOUSLY.

20:59.926 --> 21:01.428
MY REALLY NUMBER ONE GOAL

21:01.461 --> 21:03.096
IS I FIND A BUYER
WHILE UNDER CONSTRUCTION.

21:03.129 --> 21:05.298
SO I WANT TO DEMOLISH THE SPACE
IN A COUPLE OF WEEKS,

21:05.331 --> 21:07.767
AND THEN I WANT TO SEE
IF YOU CAN FIND ME A BUYER,

21:07.801 --> 21:09.769
SO 32,000 SQUARE FEET,
WHAT'S THE PRICE?

21:09.803 --> 21:11.071
- BASED ON THE COMPS
THAT ARE MOVING RIGHT NOW,

21:11.104 --> 21:13.606
YOU SHOULD BE PRICED AT...

21:13.640 --> 21:15.942
$2,900 A FOOT.

21:15.975 --> 21:18.545
I THINK 10 1/2 IS ACTUALLY
AS HIGH AS I WOULD GO.

21:18.578 --> 21:20.347
- I THOUGHT WE WOULD ASK 12.
11.95.

21:20.380 --> 21:22.182
- $12 MILLION?

21:22.215 --> 21:24.751
10.5 FOR 3,200 SQUARE FEET,
I DON'T UNDERSTAND

21:24.784 --> 21:26.920
WHY YOU'RE PRICING THIS, LIKE,
A LITTLE OVER 3,000 A FOOT.

21:26.953 --> 21:28.488
- WE DON'T EVEN
HAVE THE FACILITIES

21:28.521 --> 21:30.590
AND THE AMENITIES TO ADJUST IF--
- WE DON'T HAVE AMENITIES HERE.

21:30.623 --> 21:32.892
WE ARE GONNA BUILD A GYM
IN THE BASEMENT, ACTUALLY.

21:32.926 --> 21:35.795
- YEAH, BUT IT'S A GYM
IN THE BASEMENT.

21:35.829 --> 21:38.798
- LISTEN, RICKY, I HAVE TO BE
STRAIGHTFORWARD WITH YOU.

21:38.832 --> 21:39.799
ACTUALLY,
I'M GONNA CALL YOU LUIS,

21:39.833 --> 21:40.800
BECAUSE I'M GONNA BE SERIOUS.

21:40.834 --> 21:44.637
I JUST SOLD A PENTHOUSE
FOR $12 MILLION.

21:44.671 --> 21:47.507
THAT'S $4,250 A FOOT, 42.50.

21:47.540 --> 21:49.609
- AND I WANT TO
GIVE YOU TOP DOLLAR,

21:49.642 --> 21:51.411
BUT I UNDERSTAND YOU GOT
MORE MONEY FOR THE PENTHOUSE,

21:51.444 --> 21:54.547
BUT IT'S FIVE FLOORS HIGHER,
SO THERE IS NO POSSIBLE WAY

21:54.581 --> 21:56.516
YOU CAN GET MORE THAN
$11 MILLION FOR THIS ONE.

21:56.549 --> 21:58.852
- HERE'S THE BOTTOM LINE.

21:58.885 --> 22:00.954
FOR ME TO GIVE YOU A LISTING,
I GOT TO ASK 11.95,

22:01.054 --> 22:02.389
'CAUSE I,
AS A REAL ESTATE DEVELOPER,

22:02.422 --> 22:04.391
HAVE MY OWN INSTINCTS,
AND MY INSTINCT SAYS

22:04.424 --> 22:05.658
THAT'S AN APPROPRIATE
ASKING PRICE.

22:05.692 --> 22:08.061
- DEVELOPERS CAN BE
EXTREMELY STUBBORN

22:08.094 --> 22:09.729
WHEN IT COMES TO PRICING.

22:09.763 --> 22:12.665
I CAN ALREADY TELL THAT
IF I REALLY WANT THIS LISTING,

22:12.699 --> 22:14.567
I HAVE TO GIVE IN
JUST A LITTLE BIT.

22:14.601 --> 22:16.069
OKAY.

22:16.102 --> 22:17.637
I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND
THAT I'M YOU'RE GUY.

22:17.671 --> 22:18.938
RIGHT NOW, I'VE BEEN
REPRESENTING APARTMENTS

22:18.972 --> 22:21.207
IN THE UPPER WEST SIDE
THAT ARE NORTH OF 7 MILLION,

22:21.241 --> 22:23.243
FOUR BEDROOM, FOUR BATHROOMS,
LIKE THERE WAS NO TOMORROW.

22:23.276 --> 22:24.711
I HAVE ACCESS
TO THE CLIENTELE.

22:24.744 --> 22:26.846
I WILL DO WHATEVER IT TAKES
TO MARKET THE RIGHT WAY

22:26.880 --> 22:30.150
TO THE RIGHT PEOPLE,
BUT IF WE'RE GOING TO DO 11.95,

22:30.183 --> 22:31.451
I NEED TO MAKE SURE
THAT YOU UNDERSTAND

22:31.484 --> 22:34.087
THAT THIS LISTING WILL PROBABLY
SETTLE CLOSER TO 11.

22:34.120 --> 22:37.590
- OKAY, BUT LISTEN, I JUST
WANT TO MENTION THERE'S BEEN

22:37.624 --> 22:39.559
A CUSTOMER THAT'S
SHOWN SOME INTEREST.

22:39.592 --> 22:41.194
THEY'RE BEING
A LITTLE WISHY-WASHY.

22:41.227 --> 22:42.495
- OKAY.

22:42.529 --> 22:43.997
- BUT I JUST NEEDED TO PLANT
THAT SEED SO YOU KNOW

22:44.097 --> 22:45.231
THAT IF THEY WERE TO BUY,

22:45.265 --> 22:47.100
I WOULD NEED TO HAVE
AN EXCLUSION FOR THAT.

22:47.100 --> 22:48.101
- I UNDERSTAND.

22:48.101 --> 22:50.103
I HATE WHEN THIS HAPPENS.

22:50.136 --> 22:52.272
IF THAT BUYER ENDS UP BUYING,

22:52.305 --> 22:53.940
I AM NOT GOING TO BE
A PART OF THE DEAL.

22:53.973 --> 22:56.142
IT MEANS NO COMMISSION,
SO IT'S A GAMBLE,

22:56.176 --> 22:58.411
BUT HELL, I LOVE TO GAMBLE.
[chuckles]

22:58.445 --> 23:00.914
OKAY.
- OKAY.

23:00.947 --> 23:02.248
- OKAY, SO THEN WE HAVE
A COMMITMENT, 11.95.

23:02.282 --> 23:03.316
IS THAT A DEAL?

23:03.350 --> 23:05.151
- ALL RIGHT,
I'M GOING TO WASHINGTON.

23:05.185 --> 23:06.353
LET'S START
BUILD THIS NEXT WEEK.

23:06.386 --> 23:07.654
- OKAY.

23:07.687 --> 23:10.790
- COME ON, LITTLE DOGGY.

23:10.824 --> 23:13.793
[upbeat fun music]

23:13.827 --> 23:17.063
* *

23:17.063 --> 23:20.066
- [humming]

23:20.066 --> 23:22.769
* *

23:22.802 --> 23:24.504
THIS IS LIKE CHRISTMAS FOR ME.

23:24.537 --> 23:27.674
ONE HOUSE, TWO OFFERS,
BIDDING WAR.

23:27.707 --> 23:28.942
OKAY, PERFECT.

23:28.975 --> 23:30.243
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

23:30.276 --> 23:32.212
- BUT I WAS UP ALL NIGHT,
AND I REALIZED

23:32.245 --> 23:34.614
THAT I WANT TO PLAY THIS ONE
A LITTLE DIFFERENTLY.

23:34.647 --> 23:36.416
ALL RIGHT,
SO YOU KNOW HOW WE NOW

23:36.449 --> 23:37.817
HAVE THIS BIDDING WAR
ON THE TOWNHOUSE,

23:37.851 --> 23:41.554
SO I'M GOING TO SEND THEM
BOTH BLANK CONTRACTS

23:41.588 --> 23:45.258
AND TELL THEM YOU HAVE
UNTIL TUESDAY AT 5:00 P.M.

23:45.291 --> 23:48.395
TO WRITE IN YOUR BEST
PURCHASE PRICE,

23:48.428 --> 23:51.197
BEST AND FINAL,
WITH YOUR STRONGEST TERMS,

23:51.231 --> 23:53.700
AND WE WILL COUNTER-SIGN
THE BEST DEAL.

23:53.733 --> 23:54.768
HERE'S THE THING.

23:54.801 --> 23:56.102
I HAVE TOM'S OFFER
OF 3.75 MILLION,

23:56.102 --> 24:00.640
AND I HAVE ANOTHER OFFER
AT 3.9, SO IF I GO BACK TO TOM

24:00.674 --> 24:02.709
AND TELL HIM "HEY,
YOU'VE GOT TO COME UP,"

24:02.742 --> 24:05.211
HE MIGHT SAY NO, AND THEN
THE BEST OFFER I'M STUCK WITH

24:05.245 --> 24:07.380
IS 3.9, BUT IF I GO BACK
TO BOTH OF THEM,

24:07.414 --> 24:10.884
AND SAY "THERE'S OTHER
OFFERS OUT THERE.

24:10.917 --> 24:12.919
WRITE IN YOUR BEST PRICE
WITH YOUR BEST TERMS,"

24:12.952 --> 24:15.789
THEN I INCREASE THEIR PARANOIA,
AND UP THE CHANCES

24:15.822 --> 24:18.525
THAT ONE OF THEM IS GOING TO
WRITE FULL ASK OR MORE.

24:18.558 --> 24:20.794
OH, MAN, THIS IS AWESOME.

24:20.827 --> 24:21.961
THIS IS KIND OF
STRESSFUL, THOUGH,

24:22.062 --> 24:22.962
BUT IT'S AWESOME
AT THE SAME TIME.

24:23.063 --> 24:25.065
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
- PERFECT.

24:25.098 --> 24:26.066
- I THINK IT'S [bleep] GENIUS.

24:26.099 --> 24:28.168
BIDDING WAR.

[upbeat fun music]

24:31.204 --> 24:37.210

24:39.979 --> 24:41.214
- CHEERS, CONGRATULATIONS
ON YOUR SHOW.

24:41.247 --> 24:43.283
- CHEERS. NICE TO MEET YOU.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

24:43.316 --> 24:45.585
- CHEERS FOR DEREK.
- CHEERS TO DEREK.

24:45.618 --> 24:47.220
- IT'S MY HUSBAND.

24:47.253 --> 24:49.356
TONIGHT IS DEREK'S FIRST
ART EXHIBITION IN NEW YORK,

24:49.389 --> 24:51.591
AND I AM SO PROUD OF HIM.

24:51.624 --> 24:52.826
IT'S A GOOD CROWD.
- I KNOW.

24:52.859 --> 24:54.828
- AND EVEN THOUGH
I FEEL THE PRESSURE

24:54.861 --> 24:57.764
OF THE ZEKE AND ZACH DEAL,
I NEED TO LET IT ALL GO

24:57.797 --> 25:01.768
AND BE HERE
TO SUPPORT MY HUSBAND.

25:09.109 --> 25:13.146
- RIGHT, YES.
- YEAH.

25:13.179 --> 25:15.582
- YEAH, SURE.

25:15.615 --> 25:19.819
- IT'S REALLY AWESOME.
IT REALLY IS.

25:19.853 --> 25:21.454
- AS MUCH AS I LOVE HEARING
PEOPLE COMPLIMENTING DEREK

25:21.488 --> 25:23.957
ON HIS WORK,
I GOT TO MAKE MYSELF USEFUL.

25:24.057 --> 25:25.358
HAVE YOU GOTTEN ONE OF THESE?

25:25.392 --> 25:27.060
AND THERE'S ONE THING
THAT I'M REALLY GOOD AT.

25:27.060 --> 25:28.661
I RESERVED THE BIG ONE FOR YOU.

25:28.695 --> 25:29.662
SELLING.

25:29.696 --> 25:31.297
THIS ONE IS MY FAVORITE.

25:31.331 --> 25:34.534
2,500, BRAND-NEW DREAM.
- I LIKE IT.

25:34.567 --> 25:35.769
- IT'S GONNA BE WORTH TEN TIMES
MORE IN, LIKE, TWO WEEKS.

25:35.802 --> 25:37.303
I'M TELLING YOU.

25:37.337 --> 25:39.139
IT'S LIKE REAL ESTATE, IT GOES
UP, AND UP, AND UP, AND UP.

25:39.172 --> 25:41.675
- SOLD.
- SOLD, EVERYBODY!

25:41.708 --> 25:44.177
- I ALWAYS LOOK FOR
AN ATMOSPHERE, OR A DEPTH.

25:44.210 --> 25:47.247
- WHY, YOU WANTED TO BUY IT?
- EXACTLY.

25:47.280 --> 25:48.648
- THAT'S, LIKE, 2,200.
5,000.

25:48.682 --> 25:49.816
- I COULD TAKE
A CREDIT CARD RIGHT NOW.

25:49.849 --> 25:51.251
THIS IS SO INSANE.

25:51.284 --> 25:56.089
I HAD NO IDEA THAT DEREK WAS
THIS POPULAR IN THE ART WORLD.

25:56.122 --> 25:57.691
THAT ONE JUST SOLD.

25:57.724 --> 25:59.092
IT'S BEEN ONE HOUR,
AND WE'RE ALMOST SOLD OUT.

25:59.092 --> 26:01.027
- SO YOU MUST BE
VERY PROUD OF YOUR HUSBAND.

26:01.027 --> 26:02.328
- I'M VERY PROUD.

26:02.362 --> 26:03.630
- HOW MUCH ARE THEY?
I DIDN'T EVEN LOOK AT THE PRICE.

26:03.663 --> 26:06.533
- OH, THEY'RE SO CHEAP.
IT'S A STEAL, BASICALLY.

26:06.566 --> 26:07.867
I'M EMBARRASSED TO EVEN SAY IT.

26:07.901 --> 26:09.869
WE HAVE TO OPEN A SAVINGS
ACCOUNT FOR OUR DAUGHTER,

26:09.903 --> 26:11.705
WE'RE, YOU KNOW, PLANNING
A FAMILY, IT'S, LIKE, A BABY.

26:11.738 --> 26:14.908
- REALLY? HAVE YOU ALREADY
STARTED TO LOOK FOR ADOPTING?

26:14.941 --> 26:16.609
- NOT ADOPT. SURROGACY.

26:16.643 --> 26:18.611
DO YOU WANT TO BE THE SURROGATE?

26:18.645 --> 26:21.915
- [laughing]
- WE ARE LOOKING ACTIVELY.

26:21.948 --> 26:23.516
- I AM SO TOO OLD.
SO OVER IT.

26:23.550 --> 26:26.086
- BUT ARE YOU GOING TO
BUY A PAINTING HERE?

26:26.119 --> 26:27.721
- YEAH, OF COURSE. WHY NOT?

26:27.754 --> 26:30.256
- SOLD.
CONSIDER IT SOLD.

26:30.290 --> 26:32.492
SO MANY PEOPLE.

26:32.525 --> 26:34.594
- NICE TO MEET YOU, LISA.

26:34.627 --> 26:36.096
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING.

26:43.203 --> 26:46.840
- WE--WE PUT THE--I MEAN,
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED,

26:46.873 --> 26:50.977
THAT OPTION'S ON THE BACKBURNER.

26:51.077 --> 26:53.747
SO I MEAN, I JUST THINK
WITH OUR LIVES, OUR SCHEDULES,

26:53.780 --> 26:58.318
AT THIS POINT, IT'S--
I CAN'T REALLY SEE IT.

26:58.351 --> 26:59.686
- I CAN'T EVEN BELIEVE
WHAT I'M HEARING.

26:59.719 --> 27:01.421
I MEAN, THIS IS JUST SO WEIRD.

27:01.454 --> 27:03.156
IT'S LIKE THIS IS
THE SECOND TIME I HEAR IT.

27:03.189 --> 27:04.924
- I MEAN, ARE WE ACTUALLY READY?

27:05.025 --> 27:06.292
YEAH, WE WANT TO HAVE A CHILD,

27:06.326 --> 27:09.095
BUT ARE WE ACTUALLY READY
IN NINE MONTH'S TIME?

27:09.129 --> 27:11.498
- I UNDERSTAND, LIKE, HE'S HAD
HESITATIONS AND SECOND THOUGHTS,

27:11.531 --> 27:12.866
BUT THIS IS SOMETHING DIFFERENT.

27:12.899 --> 27:15.035
HE IS TELLING HER
IT'S NOT HAPPENING.

27:15.068 --> 27:17.470
LIKE, I'M YOUR HUSBAND.
TALK TO ME.

27:17.504 --> 27:19.639
IT'S VERY HURTFUL.

27:45.065 --> 27:50.070
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO
TALK ABOUT THIS LATER, FOR SURE.

27:50.070 --> 27:53.606
ANYWAY, THANKS FOR COMING.

27:53.640 --> 27:55.542
- COMING UP...

27:55.575 --> 27:56.876
- YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO
OPEN UP A LITTLE BIT.

27:56.910 --> 27:58.712
- I DON'T WANT
TO TALK RIGHT NOW.

27:58.745 --> 27:59.779
- YOU KNOW, LUIS,
I HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE

27:59.813 --> 28:01.081
TO SIT DOWN AND TALK WITH YOU.

28:01.114 --> 28:02.749
IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS,
I GOT MY BROKER'S LICENSE.

28:02.782 --> 28:03.783
- IAN, ARE YOU [bleep] SERIOUS?

28:08.021 --> 28:10.223
[funky music]

28:10.256 --> 28:11.224
- HEY, RYAN.
- WHAT'S GOING ON, BRAD?

28:11.257 --> 28:12.225
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

28:12.258 --> 28:13.259
I'VE HAD THIS SKY GARAGE LISTING

28:13.293 --> 28:14.260
ON THE MARKET
FOR A COUPLE MONTHS.

28:14.294 --> 28:15.562
WOW.

28:15.595 --> 28:17.397
BUT IT'S STILL
COMPLETELY UNDER CONSTRUCTION,

28:17.430 --> 28:19.733
SO I'M GONNA
START THE COMMERCIAL

28:19.766 --> 28:20.767
ONCE THAT THING
IS BUILT AND BEAUTIFUL.

28:20.800 --> 28:22.102
- YEAH.

28:22.135 --> 28:23.336
- HOW'S IT GOING?
- ALL SET UP. JUST ABOUT DONE.

28:23.370 --> 28:25.772
- SO I NEED TO DO SOMETHING
THAT EVERYONE

28:25.805 --> 28:27.173
TAKES NOTICE AND SAYS
"WELL, WHAT IS THAT?

28:27.207 --> 28:28.641
WHAT'S COMING?"

28:28.675 --> 28:30.076
SO WE'RE GONNA BUILD BUZZ.
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING.

28:30.110 --> 28:31.344
AND SO I HAD AN IDEA.

28:31.378 --> 28:32.679
I'M GONNA GO DOWNSTAIRS.

28:32.712 --> 28:35.248
I GOT SOME OF THE CITY'S
TOP REAL ESTATE REPORTERS.

28:35.281 --> 28:38.752
READY... SET...

28:38.785 --> 28:39.786
GO.

28:39.819 --> 28:42.789
[upbeat funky music]

28:42.822 --> 28:44.391
* *

28:44.424 --> 28:46.059
- [gasps]
OH, MY GOD.

28:46.059 --> 28:48.561
- ISN'T THAT AWESOME?
- THAT'S BRIGHT.

28:48.595 --> 28:50.230
- THAT LOOKS CRAZY.
- SO THAT'S PENTHOUSE ONE.

28:50.263 --> 28:52.499
IT'S GONNA BE UNLIKE ANYTHING
ANYONE HAS EVER SEEN BEFORE.

28:52.532 --> 28:53.767
IT'S LIKE THE BAT SIGNAL.

28:53.800 --> 28:55.301
WE'RE GONNA LIGHT
THIS APARTMENT UP PURPLE,

28:55.335 --> 28:56.836
SO EVERYONE'S GONNA KNOW
"RYAN SERHANT,

28:56.870 --> 28:58.805
HE HAS ANOTHER
APARTMENT FOR SALE!" [gasps]

29:03.009 --> 29:06.780
[suspenseful music]

29:06.813 --> 29:08.481
[phone rings]

29:08.515 --> 29:10.350
- RYAN.
- HI.

29:10.383 --> 29:12.352
- PLEASE, COME IN.
- HOW ARE YOU?

29:12.385 --> 29:13.820
- OH.

29:13.853 --> 29:16.589
- YOU LOOK GREAT.
- THANK YOU. YOU TOO.

29:16.623 --> 29:17.757
- A FEW DAYS AFTER I SENT OUT

29:17.791 --> 29:22.595
THE TWO CONTRACTS,
THEY CAME BACK.

29:22.629 --> 29:24.230
WAIT, THIS IS--
THIS ACTUALLY PRETTY CRAPPY.

29:24.264 --> 29:25.732
THIS IS 3.9.
THEY DIDN'T COME UP AT ALL.

29:25.765 --> 29:28.268
WHAT'S YOURS?
YOURS STARTED AT 3.75.

29:28.301 --> 29:30.437
GIMME THAT.

29:30.470 --> 29:33.440
PATRICIA'S BACK IN TOWN
FROM HER HOUSE IN PALM BEACH,

29:33.473 --> 29:35.642
AND SHE KNOWS I'M BRINGING HER
A FINAL CONTRACT,

29:35.675 --> 29:39.479
BUT SHE DOESN'T KNOW
THE NUMBER YET.

29:39.512 --> 29:42.248
CAN YOU GIVE ME
A DRUM ROLL, PLEASE?

29:47.821 --> 29:50.824
$4 MILLION, ALL CASH.

29:50.857 --> 29:51.825
- GOT MORE THAN
THE ASKING PRICE.

29:51.858 --> 29:52.826
- YEAH, MORE THAN THE ASKING.

29:52.859 --> 29:54.127
WE ENDED UP FINDING TWO,

29:54.160 --> 29:56.162
AND WE HAD THEM FIGHT
TO THE DEATH FOR IT.

29:56.196 --> 29:58.498
- OH, THIS IS JUST SO GOOD.

29:58.531 --> 29:59.499
- $4 MILLION.

29:59.532 --> 30:01.201
ONE STAYED AT 3.9.

30:01.234 --> 30:02.202
OKAY, THEY WERE
CALLING MY BLUFF.

30:02.235 --> 30:05.038
TOM CAME IN AT 4.

30:05.071 --> 30:06.339
YOU SUCK.

30:06.373 --> 30:08.508
AND ALL CASH,
AND IT'S ALL YOURS.

30:08.541 --> 30:10.377
- THIS IS WONDERFUL.

30:10.410 --> 30:13.146
- I AM A PHENOMENAL
REAL ESTATE AGENT.

30:13.179 --> 30:14.748
AH, THANK YOU.

30:14.781 --> 30:19.085
ONE LAST THING, ACTUALLY, BEFORE
I GO, WHY ALL THE DOLL HEADS?

30:19.119 --> 30:20.220
- THE DOLL WHAT?

30:20.253 --> 30:24.324
- THE DOLL HEADS.
- OH, THE DOLL HEADS.

30:24.357 --> 30:25.792
- YEAH, I FOUND SOME
DOLL HEADS IN THE BASEMENT.

30:25.825 --> 30:26.793
THEY'RE A LITTLE...

30:26.826 --> 30:31.297
- SPOOKY?
- I GUESS, YEAH.

30:31.331 --> 30:33.299
- WELL, THEY ARE ONLY DOLLS.
[chuckles]

30:33.333 --> 30:37.203
- RIGHT.

30:37.237 --> 30:39.072
- I USE THEM IN MY SCULPTURES.

30:39.105 --> 30:41.474
- GOT IT.
- YEAH.

30:41.508 --> 30:42.642
- I DID NOT KNOW THAT.

30:42.676 --> 30:44.477
- DID YOU THINK
I PLAYED WITH THEM?

30:44.511 --> 30:45.779
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
I HAD NO IDEA.

30:45.812 --> 30:46.780
- YOU THOUGHT
I DECAPITATED THEM,

30:46.813 --> 30:47.981
AND DID SOME
KIND OF STRANGE...

30:48.014 --> 30:49.249
- I--YOU KNOW WHAT?

30:49.282 --> 30:50.684
IT WAS A LITTLE BIT FREAKY.

30:50.717 --> 30:52.652
[both laugh]

30:57.257 --> 30:58.625
- CONSTRUCTION
ON THE COMBINATION

30:58.658 --> 31:00.160
OF THESE FOUR UNITS
ESSENTIAL FOR A SELL

31:00.193 --> 31:01.761
MAY START ANY DAY NOW,

31:01.795 --> 31:03.430
SO IAN HAS CALLED ME
TO MEET WITH HIS ARCHITECT

31:03.463 --> 31:04.531
TO DISCUSS RENDERINGS
AND FLOOR PLANS.

31:04.564 --> 31:05.632
MR. IAN.

31:05.665 --> 31:06.900
- HERE HE GOES.
- OH, THERE HE IS.

31:06.933 --> 31:08.535
I NORMALLY TAKE CARE
OF ALL THE MARKETING ASPECTS

31:08.568 --> 31:11.171
OF A LISTING FROM PICTURES
TO RENDERINGS TO FLOOR PLANS.

31:11.204 --> 31:12.505
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

31:12.539 --> 31:15.275
BUT IAN IS PUSHING FOR ME
TO USE HIS OWN ARCHITECT,

31:15.308 --> 31:17.077
BECAUSE HE SAID HE'S THE BEST,
SO IN THIS CASE,

31:17.077 --> 31:20.413
I'M GONNA TRUST HIS GUT,
AND LET IT BE.

31:20.447 --> 31:22.482
- SO THIS IS RICKY RICARDO.

31:22.515 --> 31:24.918
LOOKS LIKE HIS YOUNGER BROTHER
FROM ANOTHER MOTHER, RIGHT?

31:24.951 --> 31:27.387
- YEAH, THAT JOKE
IS GETTING A LITTLE OLD.

31:27.420 --> 31:29.255
ALL RIGHT, SO I GUESS
THE IDEA IS TO SHOW

31:29.289 --> 31:30.757
A VERY SEXY SPACE
WITH VERY SEXY PEOPLE.

31:30.790 --> 31:32.492
THE MOST IMPORTANT SHOT
IS WHERE YOU SEE

31:32.525 --> 31:34.861
THE COMPLETE
60 FEET FLUSH HERE.

31:34.894 --> 31:37.497
THAT'S THE COVER OF THIS MOVIE.

31:37.530 --> 31:39.366
- WELL, DAVID'S CAPABLE OF DOING

31:39.399 --> 31:40.900
A WHOLE GROUP OF RENDERINGS
AS WE'VE GONE THROUGH.

31:40.934 --> 31:42.469
- HOW REAL CAN WE MAKE
THESE RENDERINGS TO BE?

31:42.502 --> 31:43.770
- HA, WE CAN MAKE IT
PHOTO-REALISTIC.

31:43.803 --> 31:45.772
- YOU'RE CAPABLE OF THAT?
- ABSOLUTELY.

31:45.805 --> 31:47.674
- HOW MUCH IS THIS
GOING TO COST ME?

31:47.707 --> 31:49.209
- WELL, PHOTO-REALISTIC
RENDERINGS,

31:49.242 --> 31:53.913
NOT JUST SORT OF WATERCOLOR-ISH,
IT'S GONNA BE 25 GRAND.

31:53.947 --> 31:58.618
- OKAY, AND--ALL RIGHT...

32:01.488 --> 32:03.923
I THINK 25,000
IS A LITTLE BIT STEEP.

32:03.957 --> 32:07.794
$25,000?
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

32:07.827 --> 32:09.062
THAT IS WAY TOO MUCH.

32:09.062 --> 32:11.064
- WE COULD DO SOMETHING
WATERCOLOR-ISH LIKE THIS.

32:11.097 --> 32:12.265
- YEAH, NO, WE CAN'T--

32:12.298 --> 32:13.600
THAT'LL BRING DOWN
THE PRICE SIGNIFICANTLY.

32:13.633 --> 32:16.102
- INSTEAD OF SQUABBLING
OVER 25 GRAND, YOU KNOW, LUIS,

32:16.136 --> 32:18.705
I HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE
TO SIT DOWN AND TALK WITH YOU.

32:18.738 --> 32:20.073
IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS,
I GOT MY BROKER'S LICENSE,

32:20.073 --> 32:23.476
AND I PLAN ON BEING YOUR
CO-EXCLUSIVE ON THIS LISTING,

32:23.510 --> 32:27.147
AND TAKING HALF THE COMMISSION.

32:27.180 --> 32:28.848
SO MAYBE THE RIGHT THING TO DO

32:28.882 --> 32:30.450
IS I'LL PICK UP THE EXPENSE,
SINCE YOU'RE GONNA BE

32:30.483 --> 32:33.486
COVERING A LOT OF THE OTHER
SALES MARKETING EXPENSES.

32:33.520 --> 32:35.955
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU WANT
TO BE THE CO-EXCLUSIVE?

32:35.989 --> 32:37.424
- YOU'RE GONNA SHARE
THE COMMISSION WITH ME,

32:37.457 --> 32:40.360
BUT I'M GONNA
PAY FOR THE RENDERINGS.

32:40.393 --> 32:42.896
- WELL, I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM
PAYING FOR THE RENDERINGS.

32:42.929 --> 32:44.631
I CAN TAKE CARE
OF THE RENDERINGS,

32:44.664 --> 32:46.232
BUT WE AGREED THAT
I WAS DOING THIS ON MY OWN,

32:46.266 --> 32:48.501
THAT I WAS GOING TO
REPRESENT YOU,

32:48.535 --> 32:53.506
AND I WAS GOING TO SELL
WHAT YOU'VE DONE SO BEAUTIFULLY.

32:53.540 --> 32:55.108
- I'LL PICK UP
THE RENDERING EXPENSE.

32:55.141 --> 32:57.911
- LISTEN, BUT WE DIDN'T
AGREE ON HALF THE COMMISSION.

32:57.944 --> 32:59.145
- WHAT, DO YOU EXPECT ME TO HAVE
A QUARTER OF THE COMMISSION?

32:59.179 --> 33:00.947
WHAT AM I, YOUR LACKEY?

33:01.047 --> 33:03.750
- THAT MEANS I'M GOING TO BE
GETTING NO MORE THAN 1.5%

33:03.783 --> 33:05.885
FOR ALL OF THE WORK
THAT I WILL BE PUTTING IN THIS.

33:05.919 --> 33:07.554
IAN, ARE YOU [bleep] SERIOUS?

33:07.587 --> 33:08.722
I MEAN, I UNDERSTAND
THAT AS A SELLER,

33:08.755 --> 33:11.491
HE HAS THE RIGHT
TO PUT HIMSELF ON THE LISTING,

33:11.524 --> 33:13.059
BUT THAT'S NOT
WHAT I SIGNED UP FOR.

33:13.093 --> 33:14.427
- COME ON, RICKY.

33:14.461 --> 33:16.329
YOU KNOW HOW MUCH WORK
I'VE DONE THE LAST FOUR MONTHS,

33:16.363 --> 33:19.065
AND I'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS
FOR THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS,

33:19.065 --> 33:22.135
PLANNING THIS, SO IT ONLY MAKES
SENSE THAT I'M THE EXCLUSIVE.

33:22.168 --> 33:24.270
- THE AMOUNT OF WORK
THAT I'M GOING TO PUT

33:24.304 --> 33:25.972
IN ORDER TO JUSTIFY THIS PRICE,
IT'S GOING TO TAKE PROBABLY

33:26.072 --> 33:28.408
HALF OF MY LIFE, AND YOU WANT
TO TAKE HALF OF THAT?

33:28.441 --> 33:29.476
- YOU'RE STILL GONNA
MAKE SOME MONEY,

33:29.509 --> 33:30.844
AND I'M GONNA MAKE SOME MONEY,

33:30.877 --> 33:32.445
AND I THINK THIS IS GONNA BE
A WIN-WIN FOR BOTH OF US.

33:32.479 --> 33:34.347
- [bleep] THIS.

33:34.381 --> 33:35.749
THIS IS [bleep] BULL[bleep].

33:35.782 --> 33:37.450
THIS IS NOT
WHAT I SIGNED UP FOR.

33:37.484 --> 33:41.087
I'M DONE WITH THIS [bleep].

33:41.121 --> 33:44.090
[low-key electronic music]

33:44.124 --> 33:45.759
* *

33:45.792 --> 33:46.960
- HELLO, ZEKE?

33:46.993 --> 33:48.461
- HELLO.

33:48.495 --> 33:51.297
- I HAVE OUR POTENTIAL BUYER,
ZACH, AND MY ASSISTANT JORDAN.

33:51.331 --> 33:52.799
- HI THERE.
- GOOD TO MEET YOU.

33:52.832 --> 33:54.968
- NICE TO MEET YOU.
- GENTLEMEN, HAVE A SEAT.

33:55.001 --> 33:57.203
I'M REALLY UPSET WHAT HAPPENED
AT DEREK'S ART SHOW,

33:57.237 --> 34:01.041
BUT I CAN'T DEAL WITH THAT UNTIL
I GET THIS DEAL DONE FIRST.

34:01.041 --> 34:02.942
I KNOW IT'S
A LITTLE UNCONVENTIONAL

34:03.043 --> 34:06.312
TO HAVE A SIT-DOWN
BETWEEN BUYER AND SELLER,

34:06.346 --> 34:10.050
BUT WE'RE HERE
FOR A VERY SPECIFIC REASON.

34:10.050 --> 34:11.117
REPRESENTING BOTH
THE BUYER AND SELLER,

34:11.151 --> 34:13.520
I CAN'T FAVOR
EITHER ONE OF THEM,

34:13.553 --> 34:16.289
AND THAT'S WHY I'M SITTING DOWN
FACE TO FACE WITH BOTH OF THEM,

34:16.322 --> 34:18.124
TO WORK THIS OUT.

34:18.158 --> 34:21.161
A MOVE LIKE THIS IS RISKY,

34:21.194 --> 34:23.396
AND I REALLY HOPE
IT DOESN'T BACKFIRE ON ME.

34:23.430 --> 34:26.299
ZACH IS INTERESTED IN BUYING
THE APARTMENT QUICKLY.

34:26.332 --> 34:30.236
HE'S ALSO INTERESTED TO BUY
ALL THE FURNITURE FOR $100,000.

34:32.072 --> 34:34.908
NOW, WOULD YOU EVER
CONSIDER 100,000?

34:34.941 --> 34:39.079
- NO. ABSOLUTELY NOT.

34:39.079 --> 34:41.081
THE RUGS, THEY'RE SILK AND WOOL.

34:41.081 --> 34:42.482
YOU KNOW, THEY'RE HAND-LOOMED.

34:42.515 --> 34:45.085
THESE ARE THE BEST RUGS
MONEY CAN BUY,

34:45.118 --> 34:46.219
AND I'LL ROLL THEM UP
AND TAKE THEM.

34:46.252 --> 34:48.388
- BUT ZEKE, THIS CARPET,
I LOOK AT IT RIGHT NOW.

34:48.421 --> 34:50.357
IT'S CUT FOR THIS ROOM.
IT WON'T FIT IN ANOTHER ROOM.

34:50.390 --> 34:51.791
- THIS ROOM'S PRETTY SQUARE.

34:51.825 --> 34:53.093
- ARE YOU GONNA CUT IT UP, AND
MAKE IT THREE SMALL CARPETS IN--

34:53.093 --> 34:55.328
- IT'S A RECTANGLE RUG.
IT'LL GO ANYWHERE.

34:55.362 --> 34:56.963
- BUT THE WHOLE IDEA IS, I DON'T
WANT TO GO GET ANOTHER RUG,

34:56.996 --> 34:59.099
AND I DON'T WANT TO TAKE THE
TIME TO FURNISH THE APARTMENT.

34:59.132 --> 35:00.200
I DON'T WANT
TO HIRE ANYONE ELSE.

35:00.233 --> 35:02.635
IT'S ABOUT INVESTMENT
AND CONVENIENCE.

35:02.669 --> 35:04.704
- I UNDERSTAND YOU WANT
TO BUY THIS FOR CONVENIENCE,

35:04.738 --> 35:06.573
SO I THINK, YOU KNOW,
COMING TO A NUMBER

35:06.606 --> 35:08.274
THAT'S CLOSER TO THE WORK,
AND THE LOVE,

35:08.308 --> 35:11.044
AND THE MONEY WE PUT
INTO IT IS A FAIR ASK.

35:13.480 --> 35:17.784
- ZEKE AND ZACH CAN'T SEE
EYE TO EYE, BUT LUCKILY FOR ME,

35:17.817 --> 35:21.421
I HAVE ONE LAST TRICK
UP MY FRENCH-CUFFED SLEEVE.

35:21.454 --> 35:23.890
ON THAT NOTE, JORDAN HAS DONE
EXTENSIVE RESEARCH

35:23.923 --> 35:26.393
TO COME UP WITH THE RESALE
PRICES OF THESE ITEMS.

35:26.426 --> 35:28.895
ZEKE HAS OVERVALUED
HIS FURNISHINGS,

35:28.928 --> 35:31.431
SO I PICKED OUT ITEMS

35:31.464 --> 35:35.068
TO ILLUSTRATE THE EFFECTS
OF DEPRECIATION.

35:35.068 --> 35:37.771
I'M GONNA GET THE DEAL
DONE HERE BY USING THE FACTS.

35:37.804 --> 35:40.373
LET'S START
WITH THE RUGS, PEOPLE.

35:40.407 --> 35:44.644
- THIS RUG, FANTASTIC,
A SAVILE ROW, EXCEPTIONAL PIECE.

35:44.678 --> 35:47.747
ORIGINALLY THE RETAIL PRICE
OF THIS RUG,

35:47.781 --> 35:51.851
AND ALL THE RUGS
IN THIS APARTMENT, $200,000.

35:51.885 --> 35:54.187
- BUT THAT WAS A FEW YEARS AGO.
WHAT IS IT WORTH NOW?

35:54.220 --> 35:58.491
- $100,000, AND THAT'S AT BEST.

35:58.525 --> 36:00.627
- LET'S MOVE TO THE CHANDELIERS.

36:00.660 --> 36:05.498
- YOU PURCHASED THESE
CHANDELIERS FOR $100,000.

36:05.532 --> 36:10.337
- BUT RESALE, SECONDARY MARKET
NOW... [drumming]

36:10.370 --> 36:12.672
- $50,000.
- 50% DOWN.

36:12.706 --> 36:16.042
- YOU JUST DEPRECIATED 50%.
- THIS IS MY POINT.

36:16.042 --> 36:20.046
JORDAN'S RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT
MOST ITEMS HAVE DEPRECIATED 50%.

36:21.381 --> 36:23.283
SOME A LITTLE BIT MORE,
SOME A LITTLE BIT LESS,

36:23.316 --> 36:25.452
BUT AT AVERAGE, ABOUT 50%.

36:25.485 --> 36:28.888
SO BASICALLY, YOU'RE
AT $400,000 FOR EVERYTHING.

36:28.922 --> 36:30.223
- I THINK, YOU KNOW,
IF THAT'S THE NUMBER

36:30.256 --> 36:32.559
HE'S COME UP FOR,
WE CAN, WE CAN DO IT.

36:32.592 --> 36:34.394
- ZACH, $400,000.
ARE YOU ACCEPTING THAT?

36:34.427 --> 36:37.731
- NO.

36:39.466 --> 36:43.103
I DON'T THINK THAT'S
A NUMBER I'M WILLING TO PAY.

36:43.136 --> 36:44.738
- I TOLD BOTH OF YOU
THIS ALWAYS HAPPENS.

36:44.771 --> 36:47.774
YOU START FIGHTING OVER
A DAMN RUG.

36:47.807 --> 36:49.075
I'M IN SHOCK.

36:49.109 --> 36:52.712
I'M ABOUT TO LOSE THIS DEAL.

36:52.746 --> 36:55.715
[fun music]

36:55.749 --> 36:59.319

36:59.352 --> 37:00.420
- WHAT ARE YOU MAKING?

37:00.453 --> 37:01.821
- SPINACH SALAD.

37:01.855 --> 37:03.023
- ARE YOU GONNA MAKE
A GREEK SALAD

37:03.056 --> 37:04.024
WITH, LIKE,
WHAT'S THAT CHEESE CALLED?

37:04.057 --> 37:05.425
- FETA.
- FETA?

37:05.458 --> 37:07.027
- YES.
- OH.

37:07.027 --> 37:10.130
NOW THAT PATRICIA'S TOWNHOUSE IS
SOLD, I'M DOING EVERYTHING I CAN

37:10.163 --> 37:12.332
TO GET MY NEXT MULTI-MILLION
DOLLAR LISTING.

37:12.365 --> 37:15.702
- SO MY SISTER'S COMING.
- ONE SECOND. ONE SECOND.

37:15.735 --> 37:17.737
- FROM GREECE.
- THANKS FOR THE INTRO TO NAYA.

37:17.771 --> 37:20.240
- RYAN?
- YES.

37:20.273 --> 37:25.045
- MARY FAY'S COMING.

37:25.045 --> 37:26.446
MY LITTLE SISTER.

37:26.479 --> 37:28.048
MARY FAY?

37:28.081 --> 37:29.382
- [chuckles] OH, THAT'S AWESOME.
WHEN'S SHE COMING?

37:29.416 --> 37:31.518
- NEXT WEEK.

37:31.551 --> 37:33.319
I WAS THINKING WE COULD
TAKE HER OUT TO DINNER.

37:33.353 --> 37:36.056
- NEXT WEEK?
- YES.

37:36.056 --> 37:37.090
- WHAT NIGHT?

37:37.123 --> 37:39.826
- ANY NIGHT.
- UM...

37:39.859 --> 37:41.828
I DON'T THINK--
I CAN'T NEXT WEEK.

37:41.861 --> 37:43.630
- OKAY.

37:43.663 --> 37:44.898
- I'M PRETTY SURE
SHE'S GONNA BE YOUR SISTER

37:44.931 --> 37:47.967
FOR A VERY LONG TIME.

37:48.068 --> 37:50.503
RIGHT? NO?

37:50.537 --> 37:51.538
- DON'T YOU THINK
THAT'S IMPORTANT

37:51.571 --> 37:54.207
FOR YOU TO KNOW
A LITTLE BIT ABOUT ME?

37:54.240 --> 37:55.675
- I DO KNOW ABOUT YOU.

37:55.709 --> 37:56.810
I DON'T HAVE TO MEET
YOUR FAMILY TO KNOW ABOUT YOU.

37:56.843 --> 37:57.811
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

37:57.844 --> 37:59.546
- ARE YOU KIDDING?

37:59.579 --> 38:01.514
- I DON'T THINK SO.

38:01.548 --> 38:04.017
- I WOULD ACTUALLY
MAKE THE EFFORT

38:04.017 --> 38:05.652
TO GET TO KNOW YOUR FAMILY.

38:05.685 --> 38:07.520
- AND YOU WILL.

WHY DON'T WE JUST--WHY DON'T
YOU JUST KEEP MAKING DINNER,

SO WE DON'T HAVE TO, LIKE,

38:10.323 --> 38:12.158
GET STRESSED OUT
ABOUT THIS RIGHT NOW?

38:12.192 --> 38:13.493
- THIS IS HOW PEOPLE,
YOU KNOW, CONNECT.

38:13.526 --> 38:14.928
THEY TALK.

38:15.028 --> 38:17.030
THEY TALK ABOUT THEIR FAMILY,
HOW THEY GREW UP.

38:17.030 --> 38:19.466
- WHAT DO YOU WANT TO KNOW?
MY NAME IS RYAN.

38:19.499 --> 38:21.468
I WAS BORN IN TEXAS,
I GREW UP OUTSIDE BOSTON,

38:21.501 --> 38:22.936
AND I'M A REAL ESTATE AGENT
IN THE CITY NOW.

38:23.036 --> 38:26.539
- THERE'S OBVIOUSLY A LOT MORE.

38:26.573 --> 38:28.041
- I REALLY DON'T THINK THERE IS.

38:28.041 --> 38:31.044
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO KNOW?
- ANYTHING.

38:31.044 --> 38:34.714

- I LIKE THE COLOR PURPLE.

TO TALK ABOUT MYSELF.

AND EMOTIONS,

38:46.793 --> 38:49.729
THESE ARE NOT THINGS
THAT COME EASILY TO ME.

YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN
VERY VULNERABLE WITH PEOPLE,

38:52.599 --> 38:56.436
AND THEN THEY LEAVE, AND THEN
IT'S LIKE A WEAK POINT FOR ME.

38:56.469 --> 38:57.937
I DON'T LIKE THAT.

38:57.971 --> 39:01.241

OPEN UP A LITTLE BIT.

39:01.274 --> 39:04.477
TALK ABOUT YOUR LIFE.
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO TRY.

39:04.511 --> 39:06.146

IS, LIKE, "YOU, YOU, YOU,"

OTHER STUFF TO DO, HOLD ON.

39:14.254 --> 39:15.388
- RYAN.

39:15.422 --> 39:17.023
- YES.

39:17.023 --> 39:18.425
- CAN YOU STOP FOR A SECOND--

39:18.458 --> 39:20.326
- WE'LL TALK ABOUT
THIS STUFF LATER.

39:20.360 --> 39:21.828
WE HAVE, LIKE,
AWHILE TO DO THAT.

39:21.861 --> 39:23.163
- NO, WE'RE TALKING
ABOUT IT NOW.

39:23.196 --> 39:26.266
- I DON'T WANT TO TALK
RIGHT NOW, THEN.

39:26.299 --> 39:28.435
- OKAY.

39:29.703 --> 39:31.671
THAT DOESN'T WORK FOR ME.

39:31.705 --> 39:34.240
- OKAY, SO IT DOESN'T
WORK FOR YOU.

39:34.274 --> 39:38.845
- SO YOU'RE FINE WITH THAT?
- YEAH, AND THAT'S WHAT IT IS.

39:40.246 --> 39:42.282
- DAMN IT.

- NO ONE'S GONNA PAY $400,000.

39:50.857 --> 39:52.425
- $800,000
IS WHAT I PAID FOR IT.

39:52.459 --> 39:53.793
- YOU'RE FOCUSING
ON THE WRONG THING.

YOU'RE AT 100.
YOU'RE AT 400.

40:06.306 --> 40:08.174
GIVE ME SOMETHING.

40:08.208 --> 40:09.676
- WHY DON'T WE CALL IT 150?

40:09.709 --> 40:12.545
- HE JUST CAME UP 50,000.
YOU'VE GOT TO COME DOWN.

40:12.579 --> 40:15.015
- WE'VE COME DOWN SIGNIFICANTLY.
- HE CAME TO YOUR PRICE.

40:15.048 --> 40:16.216
HE CAME TO $11 MILLION.

40:16.249 --> 40:17.784
- YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT
WE WERE VERY GENEROUS

40:17.817 --> 40:20.286
IN NOT TRYING TO HAGGLE
ON THE PURCHASE PRICE.

40:20.320 --> 40:21.621
- AND I APPRECIATE THAT,

40:21.654 --> 40:23.556
AND WE'VE PUT IN THE WORK
TO GET IT THERE.

40:23.590 --> 40:25.125
- I DON'T DOUBT
THE COST YOU PAID,

40:25.158 --> 40:28.028
BUT I'M NOT WILLING TO PAY
ANOTHER 200,000 FOR THIS.

40:28.061 --> 40:29.896
- SO WHERE DO WE GO?

40:29.929 --> 40:31.564
- IN ORDER FOR
THIS DEAL TO HAPPEN,

40:31.598 --> 40:36.169
ZEKE REALLY NEEDS TO COME DOWN
FROM HIS $400,000.

40:36.202 --> 40:41.007
AFTER ALL, ZACH MET HIM AT HIS
$11 MILLION FULL ASKING PRICE.

40:41.041 --> 40:43.443
ZEKE, I NEED TO HAVE
A WORD WITH YOU.

40:43.476 --> 40:45.045
HOLD TIGHT.

40:45.078 --> 40:46.579
IN SHOW OF GOOD FAITH,

40:46.613 --> 40:49.616
ZEKE SHOULD COMPROMISE
ON THE VALUE OF THE FURNISHINGS.

40:49.649 --> 40:52.218
LISTEN TO ME.
YOU'RE DOING A BIG MISTAKE.

40:52.252 --> 40:53.820
YOU'RE GOING TO LOSE
A FULL ASK $11 MILLION OFFER.

40:53.853 --> 40:56.356
- $800,000 IS WHAT
WE PAID FOR EVERYTHING.

40:56.389 --> 40:57.357
- TWO YEARS AGO,
FOR CUSTOM-MADE FURNITURE.

40:57.390 --> 40:59.159
- AND SO I'VE COME DOWN TO FOUR.

40:59.192 --> 41:02.362
- YOU'RE FOCUSING
ON THE WRONG THING.

41:02.395 --> 41:05.098
WE'RE NOT GONNA GET THE 400,000.
NO ONE'S GOING TO PAY $400,000.
