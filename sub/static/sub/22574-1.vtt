01:01.829 --> 01:03.929
There you go.

01:03.964 --> 01:05.464
You do realize,

01:05.498 --> 01:07.833
we've past half a dozen
coffee places to get here?

01:07.902 --> 01:09.268
And some of them

01:09.303 --> 01:11.470
you can actually sit inside
where it's warm.

01:11.505 --> 01:12.745
This is the best coffee
in town.

01:12.773 --> 01:14.473
Sure.

01:14.508 --> 01:16.675
What's a little frost bite
for the sake of good coffee?

01:16.744 --> 01:18.310
I just love this time of year.

01:18.345 --> 01:20.979
Everyone getting ready
for the Christmas Festival.

01:21.015 --> 01:23.649
Setting up decorations.

01:23.684 --> 01:25.462
You may have mentioned that
once or twice over the years

01:25.486 --> 01:26.452
since we were kids?

01:26.487 --> 01:28.954
Didn't want you to forget.

01:28.989 --> 01:30.722
Hey,

01:30.758 --> 01:33.559
shouldn't they be setting up for
that ice sculpture competition?

01:33.594 --> 01:36.728
There's still a couple weeks
before the festivals starts.

01:36.764 --> 01:38.230
That's not a lot of time.

01:38.265 --> 01:39.876
I mean, they still have to
register the contestants,

01:39.900 --> 01:41.600
approve their designs.

01:41.635 --> 01:43.947
And you wouldn't believe all the
ice that has to get trucked in.

01:43.971 --> 01:45.771
I see law school

01:45.806 --> 01:47.918
hasn't put a damper on your
passion for ice sculpting.

01:47.942 --> 01:49.475
I've missed working with my Dad.

01:49.510 --> 01:52.277
We haven't got to sculpt
together in three years.

01:52.313 --> 01:54.713
(phone chiming)
Oh.

01:54.748 --> 01:57.883
Yep. I got to go.

01:57.918 --> 01:58.984
Let's do dinner tonight.

01:59.053 --> 02:00.385
I can't tonight.

02:00.421 --> 02:01.887
I promised the folks.

02:01.922 --> 02:03.822
But I'll text you
and we'll set up a day.

02:03.891 --> 02:05.958
Say hi to your mom for me.
I will.

02:09.330 --> 02:11.062
Carol:
Uh-huh.

02:11.098 --> 02:12.397
Well, I will speak to the Judge

02:12.433 --> 02:14.233
and see if we can
move your hearing.

02:14.268 --> 02:16.135
But we only have a couple weeks
'til Christmas,

02:16.170 --> 02:18.937
I'm afraid it might already
be too late.

02:18.973 --> 02:21.206
Sorry. I met Sarah for coffee.

02:21.242 --> 02:24.810
Ms. Kincaid, can you just
hold for just a moment please?

02:24.879 --> 02:26.957
Who handles Judge Pettis'
schedule over at the courthouse?

02:26.981 --> 02:28.959
Ms. Kincaid needs to
push her hearing back and I...

02:28.983 --> 02:30.549
June Whalen.
June.

02:30.584 --> 02:32.451
Let me talk to her.
Oh, okay.

02:32.486 --> 02:33.452
Ms. Kincaid?

02:33.487 --> 02:35.053
Hi, it's Emma.

02:35.089 --> 02:37.489
Let me see what I can do
and I'll get right back to you.

02:37.558 --> 02:40.125
Thanks. Merry Christmas. Bye.

02:40.161 --> 02:42.261
Give me 10 minutes.

02:45.599 --> 02:46.932
Take a look at these,

02:46.967 --> 02:48.734
I red-lined the changes
for your approval,

02:48.769 --> 02:49.880
I can have a final draft ready
for signatures in the morning.

02:49.904 --> 02:52.237
Great. And Ms. Kincaid?

02:52.273 --> 02:54.773
The Judge had an opening
two weeks after the holidays.

02:54.808 --> 02:55.774
We're all set.

02:55.809 --> 02:57.609
Thank you, Emma.

02:57.645 --> 02:58.911
We make a great team.

02:58.946 --> 03:00.212
Yes, we do.

03:00.247 --> 03:01.580
And it's going to
get even better

03:01.615 --> 03:03.382
once we get the results
of your bar exam.

03:03.417 --> 03:04.950
Assuming I pass.

03:04.985 --> 03:07.119
Half the people fail
the first time they take it.

03:07.154 --> 03:09.054
Those people are not
Emma Parkers.

03:09.089 --> 03:11.390
And with that resounding
vote of confidence,

03:11.425 --> 03:12.758
I'll get back to work.

03:12.793 --> 03:14.304
Oh, dinner tonight at seven.
Is that okay?

03:14.328 --> 03:16.195
I'll be there.

03:16.230 --> 03:19.965
Oh, hey... what's going on with
the Ice Sculpting Competition?

03:20.034 --> 03:21.934
I don't know. What do you mean?

03:21.969 --> 03:23.202
I was at the park with Sarah,

03:23.237 --> 03:24.903
they haven't started
setting up yet.

03:24.939 --> 03:28.974
They put Harvey Norris in charge
of the Festival this year.

03:29.043 --> 03:30.976
And it is his first term
on Town Council.

03:31.045 --> 03:34.112
So, he's probably just in
a little over his head.

03:34.148 --> 03:37.082
You're probably right.

03:37.117 --> 03:39.251
There's a lot to do
with the the Festival.

03:57.304 --> 03:59.571
(sighing)

04:03.711 --> 04:04.643
Can I help you?

04:04.712 --> 04:06.245
Oh, hey. Hi.

04:06.280 --> 04:09.615
No, I'm just, you know,
browsing.

04:09.650 --> 04:11.450
Uh, what do you think?

04:11.485 --> 04:13.285
It's beautiful.

04:13.354 --> 04:15.254
Yeah?
Good choice.

04:15.289 --> 04:17.289
Well, thank you.

04:28.702 --> 04:30.602
See anything you like?

04:30.638 --> 04:34.139
Actually, I do.

04:34.208 --> 04:36.375
This is... beautiful.

04:36.410 --> 04:37.376
Who did this?

04:37.411 --> 04:40.445
Uh, my brother.

04:40.481 --> 04:41.613
You should put it out front,

04:41.682 --> 04:44.349
it'll really help
draw in a crowd.

04:44.385 --> 04:46.752
Yeah, you know, he's not really
into showing them off.

04:48.355 --> 04:50.856
Oh. Well, I've been ice
sculpting since I was little

04:50.891 --> 04:52.591
and this is really good.

04:52.626 --> 04:54.960
I'll tell him you said so.

04:56.730 --> 04:59.031
There used to be a Claiborne
Tree Farms outside of town.

04:59.066 --> 05:00.799
Mmm-hmm.

05:00.868 --> 05:04.369
This nice couple ran it and they
always gave me this candy cane

05:04.405 --> 05:06.571
every time we did
our Christmas tree.

05:06.607 --> 05:07.773
Those were my folks.

05:07.808 --> 05:08.940
No kidding.

05:09.009 --> 05:10.742
Yeah, one and the same.

05:10.778 --> 05:13.578
They, uh, they retired last year
and I took over the business.

05:13.614 --> 05:15.047
I'm Nick Claiborne.

05:15.082 --> 05:17.282
Hi. Emma Parkers.

05:17.351 --> 05:19.551
It's nice to meet you.

05:19.586 --> 05:21.687
And the candy cane thing,
that was my idea.

05:21.722 --> 05:25.891
Clearly you had a head for
business even at a young age.

05:25.926 --> 05:28.460
I just really like candy canes.

05:28.529 --> 05:30.729
(laughing)

05:31.865 --> 05:35.067
Listen, about before...

05:35.102 --> 05:38.537
I don't know, there's just
something about these trees

05:38.572 --> 05:41.239
that Christmas smell,
I can't resist.

05:42.609 --> 05:44.020
That's not the first time
I've heard that.

05:44.044 --> 05:45.911
(laughing)

05:45.946 --> 05:48.580
Browse to your heart's content.

05:48.615 --> 05:51.116
Thanks.

05:52.386 --> 05:53.352
I got to go.

05:53.387 --> 05:55.354
You got to go.

05:55.389 --> 05:56.355
See you around.
Yeah.

05:56.390 --> 05:58.290
Oh.

05:58.359 --> 06:00.892
Hey.

06:00.928 --> 06:02.961
Merry Christmas.

06:05.566 --> 06:07.833
Merry Christmas.

06:40.701 --> 06:42.501
(sighing)

06:42.536 --> 06:46.438
I can't believe they cancelled
the ice sculpting competition.

06:46.507 --> 06:49.174
They don't call it Christmas
Festival of Ice for nothing.

06:49.209 --> 06:51.710
I mean, people in Westford
have been sculpting ice here

06:51.745 --> 06:52.711
since practically forever.

06:52.746 --> 06:54.346
I mean, it's the reason

06:54.381 --> 06:56.448
the whole festival got started
in the first place.

06:56.517 --> 06:57.916
You've been gone.

06:57.951 --> 07:00.118
Okay, but I come home
every year for Christmas

07:00.187 --> 07:02.320
and there's always
ice sculptures in the park.

07:02.356 --> 07:03.889
Well, the last few years

07:03.924 --> 07:05.857
the festival hasn't drawn
as well as it used to.

07:05.893 --> 07:07.559
Yeah, and I don't know why

07:07.594 --> 07:09.739
people don't want to come
all this way to sit in the cold

07:09.763 --> 07:11.741
and watch your father chip away
at big chunks of ice.

07:11.765 --> 07:13.064
Hey.

07:13.100 --> 07:14.933
I love it.

07:15.002 --> 07:17.002
Okay, but those ice sculptures
are works of art.

07:17.037 --> 07:19.838
Oh, unfortunately they are
becoming a lost art.

07:19.873 --> 07:22.174
I just... I can't believe it.

07:22.209 --> 07:25.177
Oh, did you tell Emma
your big news?

07:25.212 --> 07:28.680
The, um, county has
officially chosen my design

07:28.715 --> 07:30.749
for the new library branch.

07:30.818 --> 07:32.551
Dad! That's great!

07:32.586 --> 07:34.853
Isn't that wonderful?

07:34.888 --> 07:37.322
So once you get the results
of your bar exam

07:37.357 --> 07:40.025
we will all have something
special to celebrate

07:40.060 --> 07:43.695
this Christmas.

07:43.730 --> 07:44.763
To the Parkers.

07:44.832 --> 07:46.731
To a new design,
to a new lawyer,

07:46.767 --> 07:48.934
and I get a new partner.

07:49.002 --> 07:50.569
Hear, hear.

07:50.604 --> 07:52.871
(glasses clinking)

07:58.512 --> 08:01.046
I almost finished
carving the new model.

08:01.081 --> 08:02.414
What do you think?

08:02.483 --> 08:05.750
Too bad we don't get to
see it full-size.

08:05.819 --> 08:07.864
I was looking forward to getting
the Parkers family team

08:07.888 --> 08:10.055
back together too.

08:15.395 --> 08:17.496
Why does this bother me so much?

08:17.531 --> 08:20.932
Well.

08:21.001 --> 08:22.367
It's been a part of your life

08:22.402 --> 08:24.402
for as long as
you could remember.

08:25.839 --> 08:27.550
When other kids were learning
to skate on ice

08:27.574 --> 08:29.641
you were learning to carve it.

08:32.179 --> 08:35.647
Yeah, well...

08:35.682 --> 08:38.850
Mom's right, I should be focused
on my career right now.

08:38.885 --> 08:41.219
It's what you said
you always wanted.

08:41.255 --> 08:42.419
Be a lawyer.

08:42.489 --> 08:44.188
I know.

08:44.224 --> 08:45.991
You worked very hard
to make it happen.

08:46.026 --> 08:47.592
Then how come
all I can think about

08:47.661 --> 08:49.101
are some of the best times
of my life

08:49.162 --> 08:51.830
were spent carving
these sculptures?

08:51.865 --> 08:53.865
That is a good question.

08:53.901 --> 08:57.235
I feel some fatherly advice
coming on.

08:58.839 --> 09:01.973
You know me so well.

09:04.411 --> 09:07.145
Dug these out the other day.

09:07.180 --> 09:10.015
Thought you were
going to need them.

09:11.985 --> 09:13.885
My tools.

09:13.921 --> 09:15.554
Why don't you take them out?

09:15.589 --> 09:17.889
See if you still got the chops.

09:20.427 --> 09:22.894
You don't mind?

09:22.963 --> 09:27.966
Like I said,
it'll give you time to think.

09:28.969 --> 09:30.068
Thanks, Dad.

09:30.137 --> 09:33.071
(ice chipping)

10:13.213 --> 10:15.547
Hi, I'm here
to see Harvey Norris.

10:15.582 --> 10:17.315
Oh, he's not in yet.

10:17.351 --> 10:18.717
Schedule's been pretty crazy,

10:18.785 --> 10:19.718
what, with the
Christmas Festival and all.

10:19.786 --> 10:20.997
Actually I wanted to talk to him

10:21.021 --> 10:22.265
about the ice sculpture
competition.

10:22.289 --> 10:24.489
Oh, that's been cancelled.

10:24.524 --> 10:26.625
I know.

10:26.660 --> 10:30.228
Could you just tell him that
Emma Parkers stopped by?

10:30.297 --> 10:31.674
Ask him to give me a call?
That's my number.

10:31.698 --> 10:32.664
I sure will.

10:32.699 --> 10:34.132
Merry Christmas.

10:34.167 --> 10:36.167
You too.

10:38.238 --> 10:41.873
Vera:
And what I'd like to do is set
up some sort of small endowment

10:41.908 --> 10:44.409
or a scholarship at the college.

10:44.478 --> 10:46.244
Put it in Sam's name.

10:46.313 --> 10:49.180
Kind of a Christmas present
for my husband.

10:49.216 --> 10:52.017
Aw, Vera,
that's a wonderful idea.

10:52.052 --> 10:54.019
Well, he taught there
for almost 30 years.

10:54.054 --> 10:55.020
Carol:
Sure.

10:55.055 --> 10:56.132
I think he would've liked that.

10:56.156 --> 10:57.689
Mmm-hmm. Emma?

10:57.724 --> 10:59.164
Why don't you give
the school a call?

10:59.192 --> 11:01.893
Find out who we should talk to
to set this up.

11:01.962 --> 11:03.294
I'll call right now.

11:03.330 --> 11:05.864
Great.

11:05.899 --> 11:08.733
Good idea, Vera.
That's a really lovely idea.

11:08.802 --> 11:10.235
Hi, this is Emma Parkers.

11:10.303 --> 11:12.904
I was in this morning
to see Harvey Norris.

11:12.973 --> 11:15.707
Oh, he's still not in?

11:15.776 --> 11:18.309
No, I understand that he's
very busy with the festival

11:18.345 --> 11:20.545
but I just...

11:20.614 --> 11:22.681
Could you let him know
that I called?

11:22.716 --> 11:23.716
Thanks.

11:23.784 --> 11:25.784
They'll call back.

11:30.791 --> 11:32.824
Emma?

11:32.859 --> 11:35.060
Sam and Vera
were clients of mine

11:35.128 --> 11:37.829
from almost the very first day
I started this practice.

11:37.864 --> 11:39.030
I remember.

11:39.066 --> 11:43.835
And now that he's gone...

11:43.870 --> 11:46.204
this endowment
means a lot to her.

11:46.273 --> 11:48.373
We're a small firm.

11:48.442 --> 11:51.509
We need to give
every client 100%.

11:52.979 --> 11:55.346
I couldn't agree more.

11:55.382 --> 11:57.549
You're going to
make a great lawyer.

12:03.824 --> 12:09.694
<i>â™ª</i>

12:23.977 --> 12:27.045
Oh, those are great. We'll take
10 for City Hall please.

12:27.114 --> 12:28.980
Excuse me, Councilman Norris?

12:29.015 --> 12:30.849
Sure, yeah.
Call me Harvey.

12:30.884 --> 12:32.550
Hi, Harvey.

12:32.619 --> 12:34.786
Emma Parkers.
I'm Carol Parkers' daughter.

12:34.821 --> 12:36.020
Oh, sure. Hi, Emma.

12:36.056 --> 12:37.455
How's your mom?
Great.

12:37.491 --> 12:39.491
I was hoping you have a minute.

12:39.526 --> 12:40.925
I don't think it's a good idea

12:40.961 --> 12:42.138
to cancel the ice sculpting
competition.

12:42.162 --> 12:43.695
I didn't want to.

12:43.764 --> 12:45.408
But we didn't have the budget
for it this year.

12:45.432 --> 12:47.332
It was either
cancel the competition

12:47.367 --> 12:48.933
or lose Santa's Workshop.

12:48.969 --> 12:51.436
And I don't want to get on
Santa's naughty list.

12:51.471 --> 12:52.704
No. But you grew up here,

12:52.773 --> 12:54.150
you know how important
the festival is

12:54.174 --> 12:55.707
to the people in Westford.

12:55.776 --> 12:57.942
I sure do. I'm a big fan myself.

12:57.978 --> 12:59.344
There must be something
you can do.

12:59.379 --> 13:00.345
I'm sorry, Emma.

13:00.380 --> 13:03.381
I'm afraid my hands are tied.

13:03.450 --> 13:05.116
What if I could raise the money?

13:05.152 --> 13:06.551
Excuse me?

13:06.620 --> 13:08.164
To make up for the difference
in your budget.

13:08.188 --> 13:10.021
To pay for the competition.

13:10.090 --> 13:11.823
$20,000 in less than two weeks?

13:11.858 --> 13:13.124
$20,000?

13:13.160 --> 13:14.359
I'm afraid so.

13:14.427 --> 13:17.295
Oh. Wow.
What if I could raise half?

13:17.330 --> 13:21.199
Well, we can't exactly have
half a sculpting competition.

13:21.268 --> 13:22.934
No, I mean,

13:22.969 --> 13:23.980
but maybe you could come up
with the money somewhere?

13:24.004 --> 13:25.336
Squeeze your budget a little?

13:25.372 --> 13:27.505
You're serious about this?

13:27.541 --> 13:29.140
It's really important to me.

13:29.176 --> 13:30.875
And to the town.

13:30.944 --> 13:33.189
I mean, it's been a part of the
festival for so many years.

13:33.213 --> 13:36.147
If you could just give me a
chance, that's all I ask.

13:37.984 --> 13:40.351
I guess if I squeeze my nickels
a little bit.

13:40.420 --> 13:42.754
I could come up with maybe...

13:42.789 --> 13:45.089
$5,000.

13:45.125 --> 13:46.090
But you'd have to
raise the rest.

13:46.126 --> 13:47.759
$15,000?

13:47.794 --> 13:49.761
That's the best I can do.

13:49.796 --> 13:50.796
It's a deal.

13:50.831 --> 13:52.297
(chuckling)

13:52.332 --> 13:53.631
Good luck, Emma.

13:53.667 --> 13:56.134
I hope you can pull this off.

13:56.169 --> 13:58.703
(sighing) Me too.

14:01.308 --> 14:09.308
<i>â™ª</i>

14:15.455 --> 14:17.155
What a beautiful morning.

14:17.190 --> 14:19.023
Hey, what brings you out?

14:19.092 --> 14:21.025
Just going for a walk,
grabbing a coffee.

14:21.094 --> 14:23.795
Best coffee in town,
worth the walk.

14:23.830 --> 14:24.796
Yeah.

14:24.831 --> 14:26.431
I was just thinking.

14:26.466 --> 14:27.810
My parents used to bring me
here every Christmas.

14:27.834 --> 14:30.101
You know,
to watch the sculpting.

14:30.136 --> 14:31.102
Yeah?
Yeah.

14:31.137 --> 14:32.470
When I was old enough

14:32.505 --> 14:35.273
my dad and I used to compete
every Christmas.

14:35.308 --> 14:36.274
You competed?
Yeah.

14:36.309 --> 14:37.275
Yeah.

14:37.310 --> 14:38.910
It was a lot of fun.

14:38.945 --> 14:43.248
Wow. So, I probably
saw you competing.

14:43.283 --> 14:45.817
Maybe we saw each other.

14:45.852 --> 14:48.019
Maybe.

14:48.088 --> 14:51.923
But it's too bad that they have
to cancel it this year.

14:51.958 --> 14:53.691
I heard they didn't
have the money for it.

14:53.760 --> 14:55.460
Yeah.

14:55.495 --> 14:57.629
Yeah, I heard that too.

14:57.664 --> 15:00.098
That's why I decided to
raise the money myself.

15:00.133 --> 15:02.834
Wait, what?

15:02.903 --> 15:04.636
Yeah. I'm going to...

15:04.671 --> 15:06.938
raise the money,
put the competition back on.

15:06.973 --> 15:10.942
And how much money
are we talking?

15:10.977 --> 15:13.144
15,000.

15:13.179 --> 15:14.245
Dollars.

15:14.281 --> 15:16.414
(chuckling)

15:16.449 --> 15:18.516
You don't think it sounds crazy?

15:18.585 --> 15:20.084
You got to try.

15:20.120 --> 15:21.419
Yeah.

15:21.454 --> 15:24.088
Morning, Nick.

15:24.124 --> 15:26.591
Why, yes, I'd love a cup of
coffee. How thoughtful.

15:26.626 --> 15:28.226
(laughing)

15:28.261 --> 15:30.295
Oh. You brought company.

15:30.330 --> 15:33.631
Lonny, Emma. Emma, Lonny Barnes
my business partner.

15:33.667 --> 15:36.100
Nice to meet you.
Hi.

15:36.136 --> 15:38.469
We try to keep an eye on him
but sometimes he wanders off

15:38.505 --> 15:40.338
I hope he hasn't been
too exasperating.

15:40.407 --> 15:41.339
(laughing)
Well.

15:41.408 --> 15:42.740
It's so funny, isn't it?

15:42.776 --> 15:44.475
(laughing) See what I mean?
Total Grinch.

15:44.511 --> 15:46.311
(laughing)

15:46.346 --> 15:47.912
Customers.

15:47.948 --> 15:49.347
Oh, okay. I got to go.

15:49.416 --> 15:50.815
Okay.
Come by anytime.

15:50.850 --> 15:52.617
Thank you.

15:52.652 --> 15:54.786
We've known each other
since we were kids.

15:54.821 --> 15:57.622
You know, he gets a little jolly
this time of year.

15:57.657 --> 15:59.457
I'm the same way.

15:59.492 --> 16:02.894
Hey, feel free to sniff around
while you're here.

16:02.929 --> 16:04.929
I should get to work.

16:04.965 --> 16:07.131
But thanks for listening.

16:07.167 --> 16:10.101
Hey, I hope it works out.

16:12.172 --> 16:14.605
You could introduce me
to your brother.

16:14.641 --> 16:17.675
My brother...

16:17.744 --> 16:19.277
Right. Why?

16:19.312 --> 16:22.814
Well, I was just thinking
maybe I could ask him

16:22.849 --> 16:24.716
to use some of his
ice sculptures

16:24.751 --> 16:25.928
to help promote the competition.

16:25.952 --> 16:27.819
You know, get people
excited again.

16:27.887 --> 16:29.554
Yeah. I don't know about that.

16:29.589 --> 16:32.056
Was he planning to enter
the competition?

16:32.092 --> 16:34.058
No.

16:34.094 --> 16:35.226
No, he'd never do that.
No?

16:35.261 --> 16:36.728
Why?

16:36.763 --> 16:40.598
He's... he's very busy
at this time of year.

16:40.633 --> 16:43.101
And, um...

16:43.136 --> 16:45.470
he's, uh...

16:45.505 --> 16:47.071
he's not really
great with people.

16:47.107 --> 16:49.974
Well, we're going to
need a lot of sculptors.

16:50.010 --> 16:54.612
So, I don't know, maybe I could
get in contact with him?

16:55.915 --> 16:58.216
Yeah.

16:58.251 --> 17:00.551
I'm sorry, Emma.

17:00.587 --> 17:03.121
I wish I could help.

17:03.156 --> 17:06.656
What about all the stuff you
said about hoping it works out?

17:06.726 --> 17:09.493
Hey, I do hope it works out.

17:09.561 --> 17:11.662
Right. No.

17:11.731 --> 17:14.165
Uh, yeah.

17:14.233 --> 17:16.501
I just, uh...

17:16.569 --> 17:18.569
Emma.
You know what?

17:18.605 --> 17:21.739
I got some paperwork I got to
file down at the courthouse.

17:21.775 --> 17:26.743
So if I don't see you,
Merry Christmas.

17:28.581 --> 17:30.581
Yeah, Merry Christmas.

17:32.485 --> 17:34.052
That's right,

17:34.087 --> 17:35.197
we'll be taking the depositions
for the Simmons case

17:35.221 --> 17:36.754
right here in office.

17:36.790 --> 17:38.322
Yeah, it's a pretty big case

17:38.391 --> 17:40.925
so we'll probably need
the stenographer all day.

17:42.395 --> 17:45.630
Um, no, they're driving down
from Concord.

17:45.665 --> 17:48.599
I'll confirm the time
but we'll be starting early.

17:48.635 --> 17:50.535
Okay. Great. Thanks.

17:50.570 --> 17:52.570
Bye, you too.

18:01.581 --> 18:09.520
<i>â™ª</i>

18:09.556 --> 18:12.056
Of course.
(sighing)

18:17.363 --> 18:19.497
Nancy, did you know that
the ice sculpting competition

18:19.532 --> 18:23.701
has been a part of the Christmas
Festival for over 60 years?

18:23.736 --> 18:26.304
That's why it's so important to
help keep the tradition alive.

18:26.339 --> 18:29.040
How much do you need to raise?

18:31.644 --> 18:32.877
Um...

18:32.912 --> 18:35.213
Thank you.

18:47.127 --> 18:50.228
And Westford sponsored the first
competition over 60 years ago.

18:50.296 --> 18:52.463
Uh-huh. Could you hold this
please?

18:52.499 --> 18:54.232
Which is why I'm asking
everyone in town

18:54.300 --> 18:55.700
just to give what they can.

18:55.735 --> 18:58.069
So you want a donation?

19:07.380 --> 19:14.652
<i>â™ª</i>

19:14.687 --> 19:16.053
$20,000?

19:16.122 --> 19:17.455
Okay, I know it's a lot

19:17.490 --> 19:19.001
but I get the five grand
from Town Council.

19:19.025 --> 19:22.326
Emma, new snow tires are a lot,
this is a fortune.

19:22.362 --> 19:24.173
But I think if I could
just get their attention

19:24.197 --> 19:25.730
the whole town
will get on board.

19:25.798 --> 19:27.665
What do you have in mind?

19:27.700 --> 19:30.334
Didn't you set up
a JumpFunder for the school

19:30.370 --> 19:32.670
to raise money for
playground equipment?

19:32.705 --> 19:34.539
You want me to show you
how to do that

19:34.574 --> 19:35.907
for the ice sculpting
competition?

19:35.975 --> 19:37.575
I'd be your best friend forever.

19:37.644 --> 19:39.877
That's all I needed to hear.

19:39.913 --> 19:41.946
The lunch rush is almost over.

19:41.981 --> 19:43.626
How about I talk you through it
tonight on the phone?

19:43.650 --> 19:45.483
You're the best. Thank you.

19:45.518 --> 19:47.785
You know, even if you
raise the money,

19:47.820 --> 19:50.621
the town already knows the
competition's been cancelled.

19:50.657 --> 19:52.201
How are you going to
get anyone to sign up?

19:52.225 --> 19:54.325
I have one idea.

19:54.360 --> 19:56.360
You always do.

20:01.701 --> 20:02.667
So, how'd you and Emma meet?

20:02.702 --> 20:06.037
(grunting)

20:06.072 --> 20:07.638
She likes to smell
our Christmas trees,

20:07.674 --> 20:09.807
she was hanging around the lot,
we started talking.

20:09.842 --> 20:12.009
She's big into Christmas,
I knew I liked her.

20:12.045 --> 20:13.122
Yeah, you like everybody
this time of year.

20:13.146 --> 20:17.014
Yeah, even my old pal Ebenezer.

20:17.050 --> 20:18.460
So, when are you going to
see her again?

20:18.484 --> 20:20.117
How can I see her again

20:20.153 --> 20:21.797
when I haven't seen her
for the first time?

20:21.821 --> 20:23.621
Okay. Okay. I'm sorry.

20:23.656 --> 20:25.990
When are you going to see her
for the first time?

20:26.025 --> 20:27.858
I'm not.

20:27.894 --> 20:29.860
What? Why not?

20:29.896 --> 20:33.664
Here's this very pleasant,
very attractive young woman

20:33.700 --> 20:35.166
who I personally think

20:35.201 --> 20:37.168
would be a good influence
on my best friend.

20:37.203 --> 20:39.670
Especially considering
the circumstances.

20:39.706 --> 20:41.639
There are no circumstances.

20:41.674 --> 20:43.507
Oh, come on, Nick!

20:43.543 --> 20:45.676
It's been almost a year
since you and Tara broke up.

20:45.712 --> 20:47.111
It's time to get back out there.

20:47.146 --> 20:49.981
Oh, yeah. What are you,
my social director now?

20:50.016 --> 20:53.050
I'm talking about Christmas. You
know, all is merry and bright?

20:53.119 --> 20:55.353
Look, I appreciate what you're
trying to do, Lonny.

20:55.388 --> 20:58.522
Okay? And, you know,
you're right.

20:58.558 --> 21:00.358
Emma's great.

21:00.393 --> 21:02.293
You should hear the way
she talks about...

21:02.328 --> 21:03.728
saving the sculpting
competition.

21:03.796 --> 21:06.130
Well, that's something
you guys have in common.

21:06.165 --> 21:07.698
I don't know.

21:07.767 --> 21:09.033
It's just...

21:09.102 --> 21:10.601
bad timing.

21:10.637 --> 21:12.803
It's been a year, buddy.

21:12.839 --> 21:14.839
You got to get back in the game.

21:32.292 --> 21:34.992
Emma:
I know it's asking a lot, Dad,
but I could really use the help.

21:35.028 --> 21:36.761
If you wouldn't mind
getting the word out?

21:36.796 --> 21:38.863
Maybe asking
some of your old buddies,

21:38.931 --> 21:40.298
tell them what's going on.

21:40.333 --> 21:41.966
Absolutely, honey.

21:42.001 --> 21:43.267
Anything I can do.

21:43.303 --> 21:44.835
Thank you.

21:44.871 --> 21:47.371
Saving the competition
won't mean a thing

21:47.440 --> 21:49.140
if I don't get anyone
to sign up.

21:49.175 --> 21:51.509
I've known these sculpting folks
forever, believe me,

21:51.544 --> 21:54.645
they were just as disappointed
as we are that it was cancelled.

21:57.050 --> 21:59.283
The thing is though...

21:59.319 --> 22:02.687
The thing is can I really
raise that much money in time?

22:02.755 --> 22:04.822
First thing
they're going to ask.

22:07.760 --> 22:10.361
When you were teaching me
to sculpt

22:10.430 --> 22:12.997
you used to tell me to keep
my mind on the big picture

22:13.032 --> 22:16.500
but my eyes on each little cut.

22:16.536 --> 22:18.836
That's what
I'm trying to do now.

22:18.871 --> 22:20.871
That works for me.

22:22.208 --> 22:24.008
You got this.

22:24.043 --> 22:25.810
I believe in you.

22:25.845 --> 22:27.845
Thanks, Dad.

22:32.251 --> 22:33.962
Emma:
Yeah, it went up on JumpFunder
this morning, Sarah,

22:33.986 --> 22:35.353
it looks great.

22:35.421 --> 22:37.755
Thank you for all your help
last night.

22:37.790 --> 22:38.923
No, not yet.

22:38.958 --> 22:40.424
But there's still time,

22:40.460 --> 22:43.027
I'm sure the contributions
start rolling in.

22:48.301 --> 22:49.700
Season's Greetings.

22:49.769 --> 22:51.135
Christmas cookie latte.

22:51.170 --> 22:52.770
Aw, Emma, thank you.

22:52.805 --> 22:54.105
It's the least I could do

22:54.140 --> 22:56.173
after being gone
for so long yesterday.

22:56.209 --> 22:57.842
Oh, all is forgiven.

22:57.877 --> 23:00.411
The thing is there's just
so much going on right now

23:00.446 --> 23:02.947
I feel like I'm being pulled
in 10 different directions.

23:02.982 --> 23:05.850
I know, I have barely started
my Christmas shopping.

23:05.918 --> 23:07.663
And with the Christmas Festival
coming up and everything...

23:07.687 --> 23:10.321
Well, we'll muddle through
somehow.

23:12.191 --> 23:14.658
Speaking of muddling through,
you'll appreciate this.

23:14.694 --> 23:16.460
Oh, sorry.

23:16.496 --> 23:18.073
I almost forgot to tell you
while you were out yesterday.

23:18.097 --> 23:19.997
They called from Concord
about the Simmons case.

23:20.032 --> 23:21.665
Good, I need to
confirm the stenographer.

23:21.701 --> 23:23.612
What time are they going to be
here for the depositions?

23:23.636 --> 23:26.570
They can't. Opposing counsel
slipped on some ice

23:26.606 --> 23:29.940
and has twisted her ankle and,
I mean, she'll be fine,

23:29.976 --> 23:32.276
but she's requested
that we come there instead.

23:32.311 --> 23:34.578
And, you know,
I'd rather not delay this.

23:34.614 --> 23:37.515
So I said, "No problem."

23:37.583 --> 23:40.451
So you're going to drive
to the capital next week?

23:40.486 --> 23:43.154
We get to drive to the capital
together.

23:43.189 --> 23:44.789
What?!

23:44.824 --> 23:46.235
You've done all the
heavy lifting with this case,

23:46.259 --> 23:47.958
you know the issues,

23:47.994 --> 23:50.528
you should be the one
asking the questions.

23:50.596 --> 23:52.696
I, um...

23:52.765 --> 23:54.632
Wow.
I know, right?

23:54.667 --> 23:56.467
It's a big step
but I think you're ready.

23:56.502 --> 23:58.335
So we'll be gone
for two days next week?

23:58.404 --> 23:59.404
Is that a problem?

23:59.439 --> 24:02.673
No. Um, no, no problem.

24:02.742 --> 24:04.809
I just thought maybe with
everything going on here

24:04.844 --> 24:07.178
I should stick around.

24:07.246 --> 24:09.291
Honey, I think Westford can get
along without you for two days.

24:09.315 --> 24:11.515
(sighing)

24:27.800 --> 24:30.167
It's not even making a dent.

24:30.236 --> 24:32.002
Sarah:
<i>Emma, these things take time.</i>

24:32.071 --> 24:34.939
Yeah, well I just found out I
have less time than I thought.

24:34.974 --> 24:36.440
What do you mean?

24:36.476 --> 24:38.242
<i>My mom wants me to
handle the depositions</i>

24:38.277 --> 24:39.777
on one of our cases,

24:39.812 --> 24:42.480
so I'll be in the capital
for two days next week.

24:42.515 --> 24:44.748
But that's when
the festival starts.

24:44.784 --> 24:45.749
<i>I know.</i>

24:45.785 --> 24:47.351
So I need to make sure

24:47.420 --> 24:49.298
a lot more people know about
the campaign and fast.

24:49.322 --> 24:51.088
<i>How are you going to do that?</i>

24:51.123 --> 24:52.656
Go straight to the source.

24:52.725 --> 24:54.792
Sounds like a plan.

24:54.827 --> 24:57.228
(bell ringing)

25:02.301 --> 25:03.712
Please tell me you're not here
for more money,

25:03.736 --> 25:05.903
I've squeezed every penny I can
from my budget.

25:05.938 --> 25:08.339
I just have one tiny favour.

25:08.407 --> 25:10.107
What's that?

25:10.142 --> 25:13.777
People all over the country look
at Westford's Christmas website.

25:13.813 --> 25:15.613
I think if you linked it
to my campaign page

25:15.648 --> 25:18.482
we might have a better chance
to raise the money in time.

25:18.518 --> 25:21.585
Emma, when I brought this up
with the rest of the council

25:21.621 --> 25:23.153
everybody talked about

25:23.222 --> 25:25.100
all of their fond memories
from the competition.

25:25.124 --> 25:26.790
Well, that's great.

25:26.826 --> 25:28.437
But the truth is,
they're a little worried too.

25:28.461 --> 25:30.327
What do you mean?

25:30.396 --> 25:31.740
They don't want to
get the town's hopes up

25:31.764 --> 25:32.730
that we can bring
the competition back

25:32.765 --> 25:35.466
and then have it...

25:35.501 --> 25:36.767
well, have it not work out.

25:36.802 --> 25:39.336
It's Christmas time.

25:39.405 --> 25:41.639
The last thing we want to do
is disappoint anybody.

25:42.942 --> 25:45.776
You're right, Harvey,
it is Christmas.

25:45.811 --> 25:48.379
The time when miracles
really do happen.

25:48.414 --> 25:51.949
And who knows, maybe we can make
our own little Christmas miracle

25:51.984 --> 25:54.118
happen right here in Westford.

25:55.588 --> 25:57.132
Well, you definitely
have a way with words.

25:57.156 --> 25:59.034
Maybe you can come and
work with us at the town.

25:59.058 --> 26:00.224
We've got some other miracles

26:00.259 --> 26:01.436
that we could use
some help with.

26:01.460 --> 26:03.627
Is that a yes?

26:06.065 --> 26:09.133
I never wanted to cancel the
competition in the first place.

26:09.168 --> 26:10.467
I'll get you the link.

26:10.503 --> 26:12.503
Thank you, Harvey.

26:12.572 --> 26:14.772
(laughing)

26:19.378 --> 26:27.378
<i>â™ª</i>

26:46.505 --> 26:48.272
Hi. Emma.

26:48.341 --> 26:50.407
Ms. Baxter, hi.

26:50.443 --> 26:51.709
I didn't know you worked here.

26:51.744 --> 26:53.444
Oh, I volunteer
a couple of days a week.

26:53.512 --> 26:55.057
Gets me out of the house
since I retired.

26:55.081 --> 26:56.692
Oh, by the way, I have
a call in to the college

26:56.716 --> 27:00.017
about setting up the endowment
in your husband's name.

27:00.052 --> 27:01.252
I'm sure that they'll love it.

27:01.287 --> 27:02.620
Oh, I hope so.

27:02.688 --> 27:03.732
But, tell me,
what brings you here today?

27:03.756 --> 27:06.624
Oh, I saw on
the museum's website

27:06.692 --> 27:08.092
you have some old photographs

27:08.127 --> 27:10.060
from past ice sculpting
competitions.

27:10.096 --> 27:11.028
Uh huh.

27:11.063 --> 27:12.074
Could I maybe look at them?

27:12.098 --> 27:14.665
Right this way.
Oh, great.

27:16.435 --> 27:18.836
I've been watching them
carve ice since I was a girl.

27:18.871 --> 27:21.705
Oh, it never ceases to amaze me.

27:21.741 --> 27:23.240
Shame it all has to end.

27:23.275 --> 27:24.508
Actually, that's why I'm here.

27:24.543 --> 27:26.577
To try and keep that
from happening.

27:26.612 --> 27:29.179
But I thought Harvey'd already
cancelled the competition.

27:29.215 --> 27:30.525
Well, if I can raise the money
in time

27:30.549 --> 27:32.116
he'll put it back
in the festival.

27:32.184 --> 27:34.184
I thought maybe some of
these old photographs

27:34.220 --> 27:37.054
might help remind people of
what a great tradition it is.

27:38.391 --> 27:40.357
You're welcome to
whatever you need.

27:44.697 --> 27:46.497
Emma:
Our client, Miss Simmons,

27:46.532 --> 27:50.200
received notice that her car was
part of a manufacturer recall.

27:50.236 --> 27:51.980
But when she took it in
the dealership said that

27:52.004 --> 27:54.082
they were too busy and asked her
to bring it back the next week.

27:54.106 --> 27:55.706
Be sure when you ask that

27:55.741 --> 27:59.176
they specify in their answer
what day of the week.

27:59.211 --> 28:00.911
Because Monday was a holiday

28:00.946 --> 28:03.247
and Miss Simmons couldn't
come back until Tuesday.

28:03.282 --> 28:05.282
Good.
Great.

28:06.819 --> 28:08.552
I don't know,

28:08.587 --> 28:10.532
I guess I just feel guilty for
not telling her what I'm doing.

28:10.556 --> 28:12.322
Then tell her.

28:12.358 --> 28:15.092
Your mom knows how much you've
always loved ice sculpting.

28:15.161 --> 28:16.505
Yeah, well I can love it
all I want

28:16.529 --> 28:19.063
as long as the law
always comes first.

28:19.098 --> 28:21.098
And that's why you went to
school for three years

28:21.167 --> 28:23.100
to become a lawyer, isn't it?

28:23.169 --> 28:25.269
That was the plan.

28:25.337 --> 28:27.404
You okay?

28:27.440 --> 28:30.607
Yeah. No. I just, um...

28:30.676 --> 28:33.610
the whole thing with raising
money for the competition.

28:33.679 --> 28:35.913
Actually, I should
check to see if...

28:35.981 --> 28:37.514
No, what you should do

28:37.550 --> 28:40.217
is stop checking contributions
every two minutes.

28:40.252 --> 28:41.563
I brought you along to help me
with my Christmas shopping,

28:41.587 --> 28:42.553
remember?

28:42.588 --> 28:44.988
You're right.

28:45.024 --> 28:53.024
<i>â™ª</i>

29:09.348 --> 29:11.715
Sarah, you said we were
going Christmas shopping.

29:11.751 --> 29:14.585
We are. We're shopping
for a Christmas tree.

29:14.653 --> 29:16.353
Who's Nick?

29:16.388 --> 29:19.757
Some guy I met in town, he has a
Christmas tree lot and I asked...

29:19.825 --> 29:21.358
You know what? Never mind.

29:21.393 --> 29:23.227
Can we just go
somewhere else please?

29:23.262 --> 29:26.063
No way. Look at this place.

29:26.098 --> 29:29.333
I came here to get a tree and
that's what I intend to do.

29:45.050 --> 29:46.016
Good choice.

29:46.051 --> 29:47.718
Excuse me?

29:47.753 --> 29:50.034
The Fraser Fir is our most
popular tree this time of year.

29:51.924 --> 29:54.658
Do you, uh, have someone to
help you carry it to the car?

29:54.693 --> 29:58.262
I was just admiring it, it's
way too big for my apartment.

29:58.330 --> 30:00.297
Where I live alone.

30:15.714 --> 30:17.848
(ice scraping)

30:19.985 --> 30:22.386
So this is where
your brother hides out.

30:28.494 --> 30:30.794
Gotcha.

30:33.032 --> 30:33.997
Excuse me.

30:34.033 --> 30:35.365
(ice scraping)

30:35.401 --> 30:38.035
Hello? Nick's brother?

30:39.638 --> 30:41.638
Sorry, I don't know your name.

30:43.042 --> 30:45.042
Hello?

30:46.412 --> 30:48.912
Nick?

30:50.082 --> 30:52.249
Hi.

30:55.487 --> 30:57.387
(scoffing)

30:57.456 --> 30:59.289
Let me guess,
you don't have a brother.

30:59.325 --> 31:01.291
Uh...

31:01.327 --> 31:03.026
no.

31:03.062 --> 31:06.396
And the sculptures outside
and in town, those are yours?

31:06.465 --> 31:08.866
Uh huh.

31:08.901 --> 31:11.034
Unbelievable.

31:12.872 --> 31:15.038
Hey, Emma, wait.

31:16.475 --> 31:18.575
Emma, just... can you just
wait a second?

31:18.644 --> 31:21.545
I'm sorry I told you about
my fictitious brother.

31:21.580 --> 31:22.846
But it's a reflex.

31:22.882 --> 31:24.281
It's what I tell everybody.

31:24.316 --> 31:26.116
What? Why?

31:26.151 --> 31:28.952
It's a...

31:28.988 --> 31:31.021
it's a long and
very predictable story.

31:31.056 --> 31:32.334
And having an antisocial brother

31:32.358 --> 31:34.358
just saves everybody
a lot of time.

31:36.795 --> 31:38.295
But your work is amazing.

31:38.330 --> 31:40.797
And people should know
that you're the artist.

31:40.833 --> 31:42.833
You think I'm an artist?

31:44.336 --> 31:46.336
Yes, of course.

31:46.372 --> 31:49.706
I mean, anybody could see that
if you would let them.

31:49.742 --> 31:52.109
But, I mean,

31:52.144 --> 31:54.144
that doesn't make it okay
that you wouldn't help me

31:54.179 --> 31:57.214
when I asked for you to
save the competition with me.

31:57.283 --> 31:58.949
I'm sorry about that too,

31:58.984 --> 32:00.862
but when I heard you talking
about the JumpFunder page

32:00.886 --> 32:03.720
I knew I had to do
something to help.

32:03.789 --> 32:07.324
I didn't... I didn't
tell you about that.

32:07.359 --> 32:10.227
Well, actually, you were getting
coffee, that place in the park,

32:10.296 --> 32:12.029
I was in line
just right behind you.

32:12.064 --> 32:13.797
Oh, you were eavesdropping?

32:13.832 --> 32:17.000
Yeah, now, see,
when you say it like that...

32:17.036 --> 32:18.702
Okay, you know what?

32:18.737 --> 32:20.515
Never mind. I've got way too
much on my plate right now

32:20.539 --> 32:21.505
to be doing this.

32:21.540 --> 32:22.706
So.

32:22.775 --> 32:23.707
So do I.

32:23.776 --> 32:24.708
Great. So we're done.

32:24.777 --> 32:25.709
We are so done.

32:25.778 --> 32:28.211
Except...

32:28.280 --> 32:31.348
you might want this.

32:31.383 --> 32:32.950
Frank Duvall?

32:32.985 --> 32:34.851
He's a friend of mine,
he owns an ice company,

32:34.887 --> 32:37.054
he's a big fan of ice sculpting
from way back.

32:37.122 --> 32:38.199
I talked to him about
what you're doing.

32:38.223 --> 32:40.624
You did?

32:40.659 --> 32:43.160
I thought maybe
he could help.

32:43.195 --> 32:44.995
Throw it away if you want.

32:45.030 --> 32:47.698
Thank you for this.

32:49.368 --> 32:51.802
I really do think
you're very talented.

32:53.005 --> 32:54.771
I don't know.

32:54.807 --> 32:56.807
Seriously.
You shouldn't hide it.

32:58.644 --> 32:59.977
There you are.

33:00.012 --> 33:01.712
Hey.

33:01.780 --> 33:04.181
Check out the perfect little
tree Lonny cut down for me.

33:04.216 --> 33:06.883
Oh.
I'll meet you at the car.

33:06.952 --> 33:08.051
Ready?
Yeah.

33:08.120 --> 33:10.320
You okay?

33:13.692 --> 33:15.392
I don't get it.

33:15.461 --> 33:18.495
If he likes ice sculpting so
much, why keep it a secret?

33:18.530 --> 33:20.197
I don't know.

33:20.265 --> 33:23.433
I get the feeling it's about
more than just sculpting.

33:23.469 --> 33:25.135
You two seemed to hit it off.

33:25.170 --> 33:27.337
(scoffing)
Yeah, right.

33:27.373 --> 33:29.306
No, I saw the way
he looked at you.

33:29.341 --> 33:32.109
And I definitely
picked up on a vibe.

33:32.144 --> 33:33.543
What?

33:33.612 --> 33:35.479
Yeah, right. There was no vibe.

33:35.514 --> 33:36.847
Okay,
keep telling yourself that.

33:36.882 --> 33:38.515
No vibe!

33:38.550 --> 33:40.183
There was a vibe.

33:40.219 --> 33:42.853
You know what?

33:42.888 --> 33:44.321
Good luck with that.

33:44.356 --> 33:46.123
Emma!
See ya.

33:46.158 --> 33:47.457
Get back here and help me!

33:47.493 --> 33:49.593
Emma!

33:53.565 --> 34:01.565
<i>â™ª</i>

34:13.485 --> 34:14.985
Nick told me you were coming by

34:15.054 --> 34:16.598
and that I should listen
to what you have to say

34:16.621 --> 34:19.589
because saving this
competition's important to you.

34:19.625 --> 34:21.291
He said all that?

34:21.326 --> 34:25.094
But what he didn't say is why.

34:28.434 --> 34:30.100
My dad started teaching me
how to sculpt

34:30.135 --> 34:32.335
when I was a little girl.

34:34.139 --> 34:36.940
He and I were in the competition
for as long as I can remember.

34:38.811 --> 34:42.411
The truth is, as important as
the tradition is to the town

34:42.447 --> 34:46.049
I think it's just as important
to my family.

34:47.786 --> 34:49.485
Let me think about it.

34:49.554 --> 34:51.054
Great.

34:51.090 --> 34:54.324
Thank you.
I really appreciate it, Frank.

34:54.393 --> 34:55.559
And Merry Christmas.

34:55.594 --> 34:57.961
Merry Christmas.

35:04.903 --> 35:07.104
Dad, I didn't know you
were coming by today.

35:07.139 --> 35:08.499
I thought
I'd surprise your mother.

35:08.540 --> 35:09.873
Take her out to lunch.

35:09.908 --> 35:12.375
Well, she's in the office
on a phone call,

35:12.411 --> 35:13.755
I'm sure she'll be out
in a minute.

35:13.779 --> 35:16.613
In that case I shall share
some good news.

35:16.648 --> 35:18.381
I reached out to
some old friends,

35:18.417 --> 35:20.150
we got six teams standing by,

35:20.219 --> 35:22.285
just say the word,
they'll be here to compete.

35:22.321 --> 35:23.453
You're amazing, Dad.

35:23.489 --> 35:25.722
Thanks.

35:25.757 --> 35:27.124
What's up?

35:27.159 --> 35:28.125
(sighing)

35:28.160 --> 35:29.926
Nothing.

35:29.962 --> 35:32.140
The festival's tomorrow and I
still haven't raised the money.

35:32.164 --> 35:33.964
Keep the faith.

35:33.999 --> 35:35.799
You never know.

35:35.834 --> 35:37.534
You never know what?

35:37.569 --> 35:42.272
I never know where I'm going to
take my beautiful wife to lunch.

35:43.275 --> 35:44.774
Hm.

35:44.810 --> 35:46.810
I'll get my coat.

35:49.348 --> 35:51.414
It ain't over 'til it's over.

36:07.099 --> 36:08.543
You know I had coffee
with Emma's friend Sarah,

36:08.567 --> 36:10.967
remember she was out at the farm
the other day.

36:12.971 --> 36:14.871
Coffee, huh?
That sounds promising.

36:14.907 --> 36:15.872
Lonny:
Yeah.

36:15.908 --> 36:18.708
Kind of hit it off.

36:18.744 --> 36:22.212
I mean, with the trees and all.

36:22.247 --> 36:24.814
Way to go, Lonny!

36:24.883 --> 36:26.449
Anyway, she was telling me about

36:26.485 --> 36:29.986
how Emma works just
a couple of blocks from here.

36:30.055 --> 36:31.733
At her mom's law office
over there on Riverton.

36:31.757 --> 36:32.956
Oh, yeah?

36:33.025 --> 36:35.058
Yeah.

36:35.093 --> 36:36.960
She seems real nice.

36:37.029 --> 36:39.930
Maybe you should, uh, stop by,
say hi.

36:39.965 --> 36:42.065
Yeah, I don't think so.

36:42.100 --> 36:43.900
Well, what are you going to do

36:43.936 --> 36:45.747
just give up on Christmas for
good because of what Tara did?

36:45.771 --> 36:48.905
Let's not go there,
all right?

36:51.777 --> 36:53.109
Whatever happened
to the old Nick?

36:53.145 --> 36:54.945
The guy who used to
like to have fun?

36:54.980 --> 36:59.382
And spent every night in his
barn carving little ice statues

36:59.418 --> 37:02.285
instead of getting on
with his life.

37:05.924 --> 37:08.258
Look, I'm sorry, I just...

37:08.293 --> 37:10.427
I miss my friend.

37:12.231 --> 37:14.297
You're missing Christmas.

37:17.869 --> 37:19.903
I don't know.

37:25.811 --> 37:28.245
See? This is a nice change...

37:28.280 --> 37:31.381
from our frostbit toes
on our way to get coffee.

37:31.416 --> 37:34.251
Thought I'd give you a break for
Christmas on your first day off.

37:34.286 --> 37:36.386
Speaking of.
You don't look very festive.

37:38.223 --> 37:40.523
I don't feel very festive.

37:40.559 --> 37:42.103
I didn't raise the money
for the competition

37:42.127 --> 37:43.860
and today's the first day
of the festival,

37:43.895 --> 37:45.795
so we're out of time.

37:45.864 --> 37:47.931
Oh, no. How close did you get?

37:47.966 --> 37:49.010
It doesn't matter,
it's all or nothing.

37:49.034 --> 37:50.767
I mean, you know,

37:50.802 --> 37:53.370
you don't raise your goal then
you don't get any of the money.

37:53.405 --> 37:55.105
What are you doing?

37:55.140 --> 37:56.806
I'd still like to know.

37:56.875 --> 37:58.074
Sarah, come on.

37:58.110 --> 37:59.075
When was the last time
you checked?

37:59.111 --> 38:00.076
Does it matter?

38:00.112 --> 38:01.278
Emma.

38:01.346 --> 38:02.412
Yes?

38:02.447 --> 38:05.348
Look.

38:07.119 --> 38:08.952
An anonymous donor?

38:09.021 --> 38:10.720
For almost $10,000!

38:10.756 --> 38:12.122
He did it.

38:12.190 --> 38:13.456
Frank Duvall did it!

38:13.525 --> 38:14.525
You did it!

38:14.559 --> 38:17.260
We did it!
(squealing)

38:19.598 --> 38:21.598
Little more volume please.

38:21.633 --> 38:24.934
Um, Merry Christmas and
God bless us, everyone.

38:24.970 --> 38:27.671
Testing, one, two, testing.

38:27.706 --> 38:29.339
One, two.

38:29.374 --> 38:30.907
Harvey!
Harvey, we got the money!

38:30.942 --> 38:31.908
We did it!

38:31.943 --> 38:33.376
15?!

38:33.412 --> 38:34.577
$15,000?

38:34.613 --> 38:36.179
I know, it's unbelievable!

38:36.214 --> 38:38.081
It sounds like
you got your miracle!

38:38.116 --> 38:39.360
We have to get ready,
tell everybody to set it up.

38:39.384 --> 38:41.084
Absolutely.

38:41.119 --> 38:43.064
But where are we going to find
teams at the last minute?

38:43.088 --> 38:45.689
Don't worry, my dad's got
six teams standing by,

38:45.724 --> 38:48.024
seven including us.

38:48.060 --> 38:49.592
You did it, Emma.

38:49.628 --> 38:51.761
You did it.

38:51.797 --> 38:53.129
Yes.

38:53.198 --> 38:55.532
The ice sculpting competition
is back!

38:55.567 --> 38:56.900
Merry Christmas.

38:56.935 --> 38:59.536
Merry Christmas.

38:59.571 --> 39:01.671
Wow.

39:04.910 --> 39:05.875
Nick!

39:05.911 --> 39:07.510
We did it.

39:07.546 --> 39:08.589
We raised the money and the
competition's back on.

39:08.613 --> 39:10.947
Oh.

39:11.016 --> 39:12.048
Sorry.

39:12.084 --> 39:14.684
Wow. That's... that's amazing.

39:14.720 --> 39:15.685
Yeah.

39:15.721 --> 39:16.953
Yeah. Way to go, Emma.

39:17.022 --> 39:18.366
Congratulations.
I owe it all to Nick.

39:18.390 --> 39:19.789
What?

39:19.858 --> 39:21.069
Yeah. I mean,
you sent me to Frank Duvall,

39:21.093 --> 39:22.992
I told him what we needed

39:23.028 --> 39:24.948
and he made a donation
for the rest of the money.

39:24.996 --> 39:26.496
Wow.
Yeah.

39:26.531 --> 39:28.343
Whoa. I always knew Frank
was a good guy but...

39:28.367 --> 39:29.899
No, you are the great guy.

39:29.935 --> 39:33.069
None of this would've happened
without your help.

39:33.105 --> 39:35.905
Honestly, thank you.

39:35.941 --> 39:38.007
I'm glad it worked out.

39:38.043 --> 39:40.410
Well, um...

39:40.445 --> 39:44.280
you know, there are
seven teams lined up.

39:44.349 --> 39:48.218
Which means there's still room
for one more.

39:48.253 --> 39:52.222
Yeah, no, Emma, it gets
really busy around here

39:52.257 --> 39:54.190
around Christmas. You know?

39:54.226 --> 39:56.826
What I do I know
about big sculptures?

39:59.231 --> 40:01.364
Anyway, you have fun.

40:01.400 --> 40:03.400
And, uh, congratulations.

40:04.403 --> 40:05.735
Thanks.
Excuse me.

40:05.771 --> 40:08.037
Hey. I'll see you later.

40:08.073 --> 40:10.006
Yeah.

40:10.041 --> 40:11.608
(sighing)

40:11.676 --> 40:14.444
Look, Nick should be talking
to you about this, not me,

40:14.513 --> 40:16.446
but I know him.

40:16.515 --> 40:17.859
And I can tell
how much he likes you.

40:17.883 --> 40:21.317
Hm. He's got a funny way
of showing it.

40:21.353 --> 40:23.186
Yeah, well that's what people do

40:23.221 --> 40:25.922
when they get their heart ripped
out by someone they care about,

40:25.991 --> 40:28.358
especially when it happens
at Christmas.

40:29.895 --> 40:31.227
What?

40:31.263 --> 40:34.197
Just, uh...

40:34.232 --> 40:36.599
hang in there.

41:03.562 --> 41:04.894
Emma:
Hi, it's Emma Parkers.

41:04.930 --> 41:07.263
Is Frank in?

41:07.332 --> 41:09.566
Oh, no. Could I leave a message?

41:09.601 --> 41:11.234
Yeah.
Could you just let him know

41:11.269 --> 41:13.670
I called to thank him
for his generous contribution?

41:15.574 --> 41:17.474
No, he'll know what I mean.

41:17.509 --> 41:18.842
Thanks. You too.

41:18.877 --> 41:21.177
Merry Christmas.

41:44.302 --> 41:46.436
<i>â™ª</i>

41:46.471 --> 41:48.938
(knocking)

41:50.775 --> 41:51.975
Hi.

41:52.010 --> 41:54.244
Hi.

41:54.279 --> 41:55.778
Thought I might find you here.

41:55.814 --> 41:57.981
You know, it helps me think.

41:59.784 --> 42:01.818
Same here.

42:03.488 --> 42:05.466
I thought about what you said
about the competition

42:05.490 --> 42:07.790
and how it's different
because of the size.

42:07.826 --> 42:08.791
Yeah.

42:08.827 --> 42:10.159
But it's not.

42:10.228 --> 42:11.961
You shouldn't let it
stop you from competing

42:11.997 --> 42:13.474
if it's something
you really want to do.

42:13.498 --> 42:15.398
Emma, look, it's not...

42:15.433 --> 42:18.301
I mean, you shouldn't
let anything stop you,

42:18.336 --> 42:21.604
really, from anything
you care about.

42:21.640 --> 42:25.775
When you find something that you
can really put your heart into,

42:25.810 --> 42:28.344
something that you really love,

42:28.413 --> 42:32.482
you should hang on to it
as tight as you can.

42:34.319 --> 42:36.152
Sometimes you got to know
when to let go.

42:36.187 --> 42:37.754
What do you mean?

42:37.789 --> 42:40.590
Okay. Um...

42:40.625 --> 42:41.991
it's kind of like you.

42:42.060 --> 42:44.727
I started doing this
when I was pretty young.

42:44.763 --> 42:47.830
And it was like, uh...

42:47.899 --> 42:50.633
I could do it. You know?

42:50.669 --> 42:52.402
The tools just fit in my hand.

42:52.437 --> 42:56.472
I started entering some
smaller competitions

42:56.508 --> 42:57.807
and...

42:57.842 --> 42:59.976
it's never about winning,
you know.

43:00.011 --> 43:02.645
It's just because...
just because it was fun.

43:04.416 --> 43:07.550
Anyway, after a while you start
running into the same people

43:07.586 --> 43:10.086
and kind of get to know 'em.

43:10.121 --> 43:12.589
I met this girl.

43:12.624 --> 43:14.457
She was really nice.

43:14.492 --> 43:18.127
And, uh, she could
work with ice too.

43:18.163 --> 43:20.330
You two started
sculpting together?

43:20.398 --> 43:23.566
She's more competitive
than I was.

43:23.602 --> 43:27.837
And started entering us
in these bigger competitions.

43:27.906 --> 43:30.506
We even talked about
doing this one in Westford.

43:30.575 --> 43:32.775
You know,
tackling the big sculptures.

43:32.811 --> 43:34.811
Why didn't you?

43:36.715 --> 43:38.414
Tara and I had been
dating three years

43:38.450 --> 43:40.450
and all of a sudden...

43:40.485 --> 43:43.219
right before Christmas

43:43.254 --> 43:46.923
she decided it's not working
for her.

43:46.958 --> 43:49.158
She already had a plane ticket
to Los Angeles.

43:50.895 --> 43:53.496
Never saw it coming.

43:53.565 --> 43:55.131
Sorry.

43:55.166 --> 43:58.935
I haven't had much interest
in competing ever since.

43:58.970 --> 44:01.070
My heart's just not into it.

44:03.108 --> 44:07.043
Maybe you just need to find
somebody to make it fun again.

44:11.149 --> 44:13.149
Maybe.

44:15.720 --> 44:19.656
I got a V chisel if you want to
take a shot at that corner.

44:19.724 --> 44:23.393
I think a scoop chisel
might be the way to go.

44:23.428 --> 44:25.828
Huh.

44:25.897 --> 44:28.097
Well, I got one of those too.

44:36.741 --> 44:38.274
Hi.
Hey there.

44:38.309 --> 44:40.309
Almost finished.

44:40.378 --> 44:41.711
How was your day?

44:41.746 --> 44:42.712
Oh, just trying to
get everything together

44:42.747 --> 44:45.448
for this deposition.

44:45.483 --> 44:47.150
Have... have you heard from Emma?

44:47.218 --> 44:49.118
No. Why?

44:49.154 --> 44:50.798
Oh, it's just she wasn't
in the office this afternoon

44:50.822 --> 44:55.792
and I left a few messages,
I just haven't heard back.

44:56.961 --> 44:58.428
This is an important case.

44:58.463 --> 45:00.063
I'm sure she's on top of it.

45:00.098 --> 45:02.065
I don't know.

45:02.100 --> 45:05.101
Her head seems to be
somewhere else half the time.

45:05.136 --> 45:07.070
We barely seem to talk anymore.

45:07.105 --> 45:08.938
Well...

45:08.973 --> 45:11.040
two of you have a lot
on your plate right now.

45:12.744 --> 45:16.379
My advice is for the both of you
to throttle back a little.

45:19.584 --> 45:20.983
Yeah. Maybe you're right.

45:21.052 --> 45:24.487
Christmas Festival
starts tonight.

45:24.556 --> 45:28.257
We'll meet Emma there,
enjoy the festivities...

45:28.293 --> 45:29.759
together.

45:29.794 --> 45:33.029
And everything will be fine.

45:33.064 --> 45:34.731
Oh.

45:34.766 --> 45:36.599
(sighing)

45:36.634 --> 45:38.735
Yeah.

45:48.246 --> 45:50.113
We make a pretty good team.

45:50.148 --> 45:51.247
(phone chiming)

45:51.282 --> 45:53.416
Oh.

45:55.887 --> 45:57.186
Oh no.

45:57.222 --> 45:58.187
I got to go.

45:58.223 --> 45:59.422
What's wrong?

45:59.457 --> 46:01.057
No, nothing, I just...

46:01.092 --> 46:03.559
I should be at work, we've got
this big case coming up

46:03.595 --> 46:05.394
and I haven't even finished.

46:05.430 --> 46:07.730
And my parents want me

46:07.766 --> 46:10.800
to meet them at the
Christmas Festival tonight.

46:10.869 --> 46:12.034
Maybe I'll see you there.

46:12.070 --> 46:13.436
Not if I don't get my work done.

46:13.471 --> 46:15.972
Well then, get out of here,
get to work.

46:16.040 --> 46:18.541
All right. Thanks for...

46:18.576 --> 46:20.376
thanks for letting me chip.

46:20.411 --> 46:22.545
It's my pleasure.

46:22.580 --> 46:24.714
All right. I'm out.

46:28.186 --> 46:30.253
(mouthing words)

46:31.556 --> 46:36.092
<i>â™ª</i>

46:36.127 --> 46:38.861
Beautiful!

46:38.897 --> 46:41.731
Oh, my gosh. This is gorgeous.

46:41.766 --> 46:43.766
Oh, look at these.

46:43.802 --> 46:46.269
Very nice.

46:46.304 --> 46:48.271
I'm going to get
one of these for you.

46:48.306 --> 46:49.739
Yes, you are.

46:49.774 --> 46:51.674
Can you see her?
No.

46:51.709 --> 46:53.209
Harvey:
Good evening, everyone!

46:53.244 --> 46:54.710
Welcome to the first night

46:54.746 --> 46:57.513
of Westford's annual
Christmas Festival!

46:57.549 --> 47:00.683
(cheering)

47:00.718 --> 47:03.553
I'm going to give her a call.
Sounds good, yeah.

47:04.689 --> 47:07.423
(phone ringing)

47:08.893 --> 47:10.193
Hi, Mom.

47:10.228 --> 47:13.196
Hey. What...

47:13.231 --> 47:15.264
Oh, Emma,
you don't have to be working

47:15.300 --> 47:18.367
<i>on the first night of
the Christmas Festival.</i>

47:18.403 --> 47:20.403
I...

47:20.438 --> 47:23.239
Okay. Five minutes.
We'll be here.

47:23.274 --> 47:25.241
She's at the office.

47:25.276 --> 47:26.921
Harvey:
I'm especially excited
to remind everyone

47:26.945 --> 47:30.446
that because of
the donations from you

47:30.515 --> 47:33.950
the ice sculpting competition
is part of our festival again.

47:34.018 --> 47:35.551
(cheering)
All right!

47:35.587 --> 47:36.953
(cheering)

47:37.021 --> 47:38.688
That's great!

47:38.723 --> 47:40.523
It certainly is.

47:40.558 --> 47:42.725
Do you know what?
If I know Emma,

47:42.760 --> 47:44.961
that five minutes
is going to take an hour.

47:45.029 --> 47:46.707
So I'm just... I'm just
going to go get here and...

47:46.731 --> 47:48.197
Well, don't...
You wait here.

47:48.233 --> 47:49.498
I'm going to go get her.

47:49.534 --> 47:50.833
Okay.
Carol!

47:50.869 --> 47:53.202
(knocking)

47:56.207 --> 47:58.207
Hey, I was just headed over.

47:58.243 --> 47:59.709
I'm sorry. Nick!

47:59.744 --> 48:00.910
Hi.

48:00.945 --> 48:04.113
Hi. Welcome.

48:04.182 --> 48:06.182
Yeah, Lonny told me
you worked on Riverton Street,

48:06.217 --> 48:09.285
your mom's law office, and I
figured, "What are the odds?"

48:09.354 --> 48:12.288
Right? More than one lawyer
named Parkers on the street.

48:12.357 --> 48:14.223
You found me.

48:14.259 --> 48:15.870
Yeah. Look, if you're busy
I'll come back.

48:15.894 --> 48:17.994
No, no, no. Come in, come in.

48:23.902 --> 48:27.069
It's very lawyerish.

48:27.105 --> 48:30.072
(chuckling)

48:31.843 --> 48:34.877
Uh, this seemed like a good idea
a little while ago.

48:34.913 --> 48:36.612
What did?

48:36.681 --> 48:38.014
All right.

48:38.049 --> 48:39.749
The thing is...

48:39.784 --> 48:40.928
I've been thinking about
what you said.

48:40.952 --> 48:43.085
And maybe you're right.

48:43.154 --> 48:47.023
Maybe it would be good for me to
take another shot at competing.

48:47.058 --> 48:49.225
And not to win, 'cause, you
know, that was never the...

48:49.260 --> 48:51.260
the point of it all.

48:52.931 --> 48:57.166
I just want to feel
the way it used to feel

48:57.201 --> 48:59.235
before things got
all jumbled up.

48:59.270 --> 49:01.037
When it was fun.

49:01.072 --> 49:03.072
I think that's a great idea.

49:04.676 --> 49:07.910
So, like you said,

49:07.946 --> 49:09.912
I just need to find
the right partner.

49:09.948 --> 49:13.582
Someone who knows
big sculptures.

49:13.651 --> 49:15.718
Someone...

49:16.988 --> 49:17.988
like you.

49:18.022 --> 49:20.056
I...

49:20.091 --> 49:22.158
You already have a partner.

49:22.193 --> 49:25.494
My dad and I have been sculpting
together since I was a kid.

49:27.498 --> 49:29.265
Sort of a tradition.

49:29.334 --> 49:31.567
I'm sorry.

49:31.602 --> 49:32.835
Hey, don't be sorry.

49:32.870 --> 49:35.371
I, uh, I'll be there
to cheer you on.

49:35.406 --> 49:36.939
100%.

49:37.008 --> 49:38.541
Go, Emma!

49:38.576 --> 49:40.810
(laughing)

49:40.845 --> 49:42.912
Nick:
So, I should go.

49:42.981 --> 49:45.181
I'll walk you out.

49:54.359 --> 49:55.725
I'll see you then.

49:55.760 --> 49:57.994
Okay.

50:08.573 --> 50:13.109
<i>â™ª</i>

50:13.177 --> 50:14.610
Dan:
Emma.

50:14.679 --> 50:16.712
What are you doing out here
so early?

50:16.748 --> 50:19.682
Well, if the Parkers family team
wants to win this year

50:19.717 --> 50:21.283
we better busy.

50:21.352 --> 50:23.953
Yeah, I've been, uh...

50:24.022 --> 50:25.921
I've been thinking about that.

50:25.957 --> 50:27.590
Good. We don't have much time.

50:27.625 --> 50:32.628
As much as I have loved
doing this with you, kiddo.

50:34.465 --> 50:36.899
I am... snowed under with work.

50:36.934 --> 50:39.935
I think you're going to have to
find a new partner this year.

50:40.004 --> 50:41.871
Really?

50:41.906 --> 50:44.040
But, um...

50:44.075 --> 50:45.574
this is our tradition.

50:45.610 --> 50:48.611
And I have... I've loved
every minute of it.

50:48.679 --> 50:52.348
And I want you to carry on that
tradition with someone else,

50:52.383 --> 50:54.550
someone who loves this
as much as we do.

50:58.289 --> 51:00.756
But I've never done it
without you.

51:00.792 --> 51:04.160
Well, that's why...

51:04.195 --> 51:08.097
this time around you can
make it your own.

51:13.071 --> 51:15.071
That's my girl.

51:31.789 --> 51:33.756
Man:
Hey, Nick!

51:36.327 --> 51:38.094
Hey!
Hey.

51:38.162 --> 51:39.829
Isn't this crazy?

51:39.864 --> 51:41.363
When I was a kid I used to think

51:41.399 --> 51:44.667
this must be what
Santa's toy shop was like.

51:44.702 --> 51:47.603
So much to do before Christmas.

51:47.672 --> 51:49.238
So, you and your dad all set?

51:49.273 --> 51:52.575
Mm, he can't do it this year.

51:52.610 --> 51:53.576
Work.

51:53.611 --> 51:55.411
So.
Oh.

51:55.446 --> 51:56.745
I'm sorry.

51:56.781 --> 51:59.281
Yeah, me too.

51:59.350 --> 52:00.916
So you don't have a partner?

52:00.985 --> 52:03.419
Did you?

52:03.488 --> 52:05.154
Did you find someone?

52:05.189 --> 52:06.856
That's a lot of work.
Yeah.

52:06.891 --> 52:09.391
Not much time to prepare.

52:09.427 --> 52:10.759
On the other hand...

52:10.828 --> 52:11.861
It could be fun.

52:11.896 --> 52:13.696
It could be fun.

52:13.731 --> 52:15.498
Partners?

52:15.533 --> 52:17.366
Partners.

52:17.401 --> 52:20.569
(laughing)

52:22.707 --> 52:23.984
Emma:
All right, we don't have much
time so I'm going to give you

52:24.008 --> 52:25.708
the CliffsNotes version
of the rules.

52:25.743 --> 52:28.511
Each team has two members,
we're given six blocks of ice.

52:28.546 --> 52:30.412
Sculptures have to be
at least five feet tall

52:30.481 --> 52:31.847
but no more than 10 feet.

52:31.883 --> 52:34.316
And we can only use
the ice we're given.

52:34.352 --> 52:35.985
How do you remember all that?

52:36.020 --> 52:37.419
Cute.

52:37.488 --> 52:40.422
Competition lasts three days,
72 hours,

52:40.491 --> 52:43.659
during that time each
team member is only permitted

52:43.694 --> 52:46.362
a total carving time
of up to 36 hours.

52:46.397 --> 52:48.731
That's to make sure
nobody gets too tired.

52:48.766 --> 52:50.332
And that's it.

52:50.368 --> 52:51.734
Got it.
Got it.

52:51.769 --> 52:53.269
Got it.

52:53.337 --> 52:54.870
(sighing)

52:54.906 --> 52:57.573
Wow. That's some
serious hardware.

52:57.642 --> 52:58.841
Thank you.

52:58.876 --> 53:01.143
(grunting)

53:02.580 --> 53:04.180
So, where are your power tools?

53:04.215 --> 53:06.315
I don't use 'em.

53:06.350 --> 53:09.752
Okay. Well, uh,
then we'll work on that first.

53:09.820 --> 53:11.086
Why?

53:11.155 --> 53:13.155
Nick, these aren't
little sculptures

53:13.191 --> 53:15.858
you put on a table
at a wedding.

53:15.893 --> 53:17.593
These are huge.

53:17.662 --> 53:20.029
If we just use hand tools
we'll never finish in time.

53:20.064 --> 53:22.431
You're smiling.

53:22.500 --> 53:23.432
Why are you smiling?
I'm not.

53:23.501 --> 53:24.833
You are smiling.
I'm not.

53:24.869 --> 53:27.536
Seriously, we don't have time
for this.

53:27.572 --> 53:30.806
It's just, okay, look,
all of a sudden I...

53:30.841 --> 53:33.375
I could see this
gangly little girl

53:33.411 --> 53:35.144
all serious about this stuff

53:35.179 --> 53:39.348
who had no idea that she'd grow
up to be someone so amazing.

53:42.753 --> 53:44.920
(sighing)
Come on, we have work to do.

53:55.066 --> 53:56.632
See?

53:56.667 --> 53:58.545
You can't get a cut like that
with a power tool.

53:58.569 --> 53:59.535
Yeah.

53:59.570 --> 54:01.303
It's nice.

54:01.339 --> 54:03.539
And who knows? Maybe we could
finish by next Christmas.

54:03.574 --> 54:05.641
Is that sarcasm?

54:10.081 --> 54:12.214
(whistling)

54:14.752 --> 54:16.819
What? Whoa.

54:18.756 --> 54:22.191
Okay. Now, just remember
nice and easy.

54:24.629 --> 54:25.561
(gasping)

54:25.630 --> 54:27.396
Oh, boy.

54:27.465 --> 54:29.064
Wow.

54:29.133 --> 54:30.733
All right.

54:30.801 --> 54:33.035
I guess we'll start again.

54:33.070 --> 54:35.471
Sorry.

54:40.511 --> 54:41.844
Now, that's eight feet.

54:41.879 --> 54:42.956
So that's how tall
our sculpture should be.

54:42.980 --> 54:46.215
Wow, that's big.

54:46.250 --> 54:48.584
We still have to come up
with a design.

54:51.222 --> 54:53.355
Look, we can't just
settle on one thing.

54:53.391 --> 54:55.391
Right? We have to...

54:55.459 --> 54:59.728
I don't know, think of something
that tells a story

54:59.797 --> 55:02.564
with one image.

55:02.633 --> 55:04.500
Okay. What do you suggest?

55:04.535 --> 55:06.335
That's the thing, I don't know.

55:06.370 --> 55:09.204
What we need right now
is some serious inspiration.

55:10.574 --> 55:12.241
Well, we'd better
get inspired soon

55:12.310 --> 55:14.054
or we're going to have the only
sculpture in town history

55:14.078 --> 55:16.478
called the block of ice.

55:16.514 --> 55:18.514
(laughing)

55:19.650 --> 55:20.827
All right. It's been a long day.

55:20.851 --> 55:22.217
Why don't we just
call it a night

55:22.286 --> 55:24.687
and we'll come up
with something tomorrow?

55:24.722 --> 55:26.055
Sure.

55:26.123 --> 55:28.524
Great.

55:29.527 --> 55:30.492
This was good.

55:30.528 --> 55:31.560
Yeah.

55:31.629 --> 55:33.696
Yeah?
Yeah.

55:33.731 --> 55:35.998
Okay, then.

56:01.659 --> 56:03.492
Nick, it's Emma.

56:03.527 --> 56:06.295
Remember what you said
about town history?

56:09.633 --> 56:11.500
Trust me.

56:11.535 --> 56:14.169
Emma, welcome back.

56:14.205 --> 56:16.004
Hi, Vera,
this is Nick Claiborne.

56:16.040 --> 56:18.807
He and I are partnering up for
the ice sculpting competition.

56:18.843 --> 56:20.209
Nice to meet you.

56:20.277 --> 56:22.089
But shouldn't you two be
sharpening your chisels?

56:22.113 --> 56:23.790
Well, we have to decide
what to sculpt first.

56:23.814 --> 56:25.948
Do you mind if we look at
those pictures again?

56:25.983 --> 56:29.284
I'll go get them. Oh, take a
look at the new display.

56:31.222 --> 56:33.288
(gasping)

56:35.693 --> 56:38.694
I can't believe they made
all these with just hand tools.

56:38.729 --> 56:40.062
Pretty amazing, right?

56:40.131 --> 56:42.030
No kidding. But...

56:42.099 --> 56:44.700
I'm still not sure how this
is going to help us.

56:44.769 --> 56:46.602
Well.

56:46.637 --> 56:49.204
All these sculptures
are special in some way

56:49.273 --> 56:52.641
and just want whatever we do
to mean something too.

56:54.712 --> 56:55.922
It's not about the town, is it?

56:55.946 --> 56:57.346
It's about you.

56:57.381 --> 56:59.448
(sighing)

56:59.483 --> 57:02.351
My mother doesn't even know
I'm doing this.

57:03.888 --> 57:06.522
I, uh, I didn't tell her
because she would just say

57:06.557 --> 57:08.957
it's a distraction
from my legal career.

57:08.993 --> 57:11.126
I thought you said
you weren't a lawyer.

57:11.162 --> 57:13.028
Oh, I said not yet.

57:13.097 --> 57:15.330
I took the bar exam,
I'm waiting for the results.

57:15.366 --> 57:17.166
And when you do?

57:17.201 --> 57:21.303
When I do I hang out my shingle
and go to work with my mother.

57:21.338 --> 57:23.672
In the meantime, I'm supposed to
be soaking everything in

57:23.707 --> 57:25.707
so I can hit the ground running.

57:27.778 --> 57:29.611
You don't sound
very happy about it.

57:29.647 --> 57:31.613
(sighing)

57:31.649 --> 57:35.050
This isn't helping us
decide what to sculpt.

57:36.187 --> 57:39.121
(phone ringing)

57:39.156 --> 57:41.256
Hi, Frank?

57:41.292 --> 57:42.925
Yeah, thanks for
calling me back.

57:42.960 --> 57:46.195
I just wanted to thank you
for helping us with the...

57:47.631 --> 57:50.332
Oh, uh.

57:50.367 --> 57:52.201
Okay. Uh...

57:52.269 --> 57:54.436
(sighing)

57:54.472 --> 57:56.338
Yeah. Yeah. No. Okay.

57:56.373 --> 57:57.940
Thanks for telling me.

57:57.975 --> 58:00.342
Merry Christmas.

58:00.377 --> 58:01.710
Huh.

58:01.779 --> 58:02.711
What was that about?

58:02.780 --> 58:04.179
That was Frank Duvall,

58:04.215 --> 58:06.582
he said he got my call
about the donation.

58:08.419 --> 58:10.252
He said it wasn't him.

58:10.287 --> 58:12.688
He didn't donate the money.

58:12.756 --> 58:15.023
Who did?

58:18.696 --> 58:23.499
<i>â™ª</i>

58:23.534 --> 58:25.067
Why would someone
give all that money

58:25.102 --> 58:26.502
and want to keep it a secret?

58:26.537 --> 58:29.037
Maybe because that's the
definition of anonymous.

58:29.073 --> 58:31.907
Okay. Well, I'd like to
at least thank them.

58:33.010 --> 58:34.510
(phone ringing)

58:34.545 --> 58:36.078
It's Nick.

58:36.146 --> 58:38.247
Says he has an idea
for our sculpture.

58:38.315 --> 58:40.182
And how's that going?

58:40.217 --> 58:41.550
Good.

58:41.585 --> 58:43.585
If we could just
come up with a design.

58:43.654 --> 58:45.420
That's not what I meant.

58:45.489 --> 58:47.189
Nick is a great guy.

58:47.224 --> 58:48.991
Sounds like it.

58:49.026 --> 58:51.894
But I just have so much going on
right now with the competition

58:51.929 --> 58:53.562
and work and...

58:53.597 --> 58:56.198
I just really
need to stay focused.

58:56.233 --> 58:58.100
Focused is good.

58:58.168 --> 58:59.668
Don't give me that.

58:59.703 --> 59:02.237
Don't even.

59:02.306 --> 59:05.007
Okay. I admit I had my doubts
about the museum

59:05.042 --> 59:07.009
and getting inspired
and all that stuff.

59:07.044 --> 59:11.246
But when you left it was like,
boom, there it was.

59:12.983 --> 59:15.217
Keep in mind
I can't draw for beans.

59:15.252 --> 59:17.319
Nick, just show me.

59:17.354 --> 59:19.254
So.
(gasping)

59:19.323 --> 59:21.557
What do you think?

59:23.160 --> 59:25.260
I love it.

59:26.397 --> 59:27.362
Then let's get to work.

59:27.398 --> 59:35.398
<i>â™ª</i>

59:39.643 --> 59:41.643
(laughing)

59:50.721 --> 59:52.354
Come on, put your back into it.

59:52.389 --> 59:55.657
(laughing)

59:58.796 --> 01:00:01.463
Wow, it's late.

01:00:01.498 --> 01:00:03.498
Yeah, we've been at this
a while.

01:00:05.736 --> 01:00:08.337
Thank you.

01:00:08.372 --> 01:00:11.473
None of this would've happened
without you.

01:00:11.508 --> 01:00:14.509
No, you made this happen, Emma.

01:00:14.545 --> 01:00:16.144
I'm just...

01:00:16.180 --> 01:00:18.213
just lucky to be here
when you did.

01:00:18.248 --> 01:00:20.349
(phone ringing)

01:00:20.384 --> 01:00:21.750
Emma:
<i>Hi, Mom?</i>

01:00:21.819 --> 01:00:23.385
Hey, honey, I just wanted
to remind you

01:00:23.420 --> 01:00:25.131
that we need to get
an early start in the morning

01:00:25.155 --> 01:00:27.133
if we're going to make it on
time for the depositions.

01:00:27.157 --> 01:00:29.691
The depositions.

01:00:29.727 --> 01:00:31.526
You didn't forget, did you?

01:00:31.562 --> 01:00:33.362
No, no, of course not.

01:00:33.397 --> 01:00:35.397
I'm just, I'm a little tired.

01:00:35.466 --> 01:00:38.066
Oh, well get some rest.
I'll meet you at the office.

01:00:38.135 --> 01:00:39.835
<i>Big day tomorrow.</i>

01:00:39.870 --> 01:00:41.970
Yeah. Got it. Thanks, Mom.

01:00:45.876 --> 01:00:47.743
Everything okay?

01:00:47.811 --> 01:00:49.878
I should go.

01:00:50.981 --> 01:00:52.381
Okay.

01:00:52.416 --> 01:00:54.683
Go. Get some rest.
We got a bid day tomorrow.

01:00:54.718 --> 01:00:56.551
Yeah.

01:00:56.620 --> 01:00:58.720
Yeah, big day.

01:01:00.124 --> 01:01:02.224
Big day.

01:01:42.199 --> 01:01:44.633
Mom?

01:01:44.668 --> 01:01:46.535
All set.

01:01:46.570 --> 01:01:47.536
Oh.

01:01:47.571 --> 01:01:49.071
I meant to ask you

01:01:49.139 --> 01:01:50.984
to pick up some of that
great coffee on your way.

01:01:51.008 --> 01:01:52.774
But never mind, we'll stop.

01:01:52.810 --> 01:01:54.176
I need to talk to you.

01:01:54.211 --> 01:01:55.510
Can we talk in the car?

01:01:55.546 --> 01:01:57.612
Mom.

01:01:57.648 --> 01:01:59.448
Oh. All right.
What is it?

01:01:59.483 --> 01:02:01.550
I know how important
this case it to you,

01:02:01.618 --> 01:02:02.696
and I know how much
you want me...

01:02:02.720 --> 01:02:05.153
(phone ringing)

01:02:08.525 --> 01:02:10.726
Parkers Law Office.

01:02:10.794 --> 01:02:12.394
Speaking.

01:02:12.463 --> 01:02:14.730
Yes, yes, I did.

01:02:14.798 --> 01:02:16.198
Oh, really?

01:02:16.233 --> 01:02:17.332
Well, that's great.

01:02:17.367 --> 01:02:19.334
I hope so too.
Merry Christmas.

01:02:21.638 --> 01:02:24.673
That was the endowment office
at the college.

01:02:24.708 --> 01:02:26.508
They want to talk about

01:02:26.543 --> 01:02:27.509
the scholarship Vera wants to
set up in her husband's name.

01:02:27.544 --> 01:02:29.377
That's wonderful.

01:02:29.446 --> 01:02:31.713
But today's the last day
before the holiday

01:02:31.782 --> 01:02:33.882
and they need to meet
this morning.

01:02:33.951 --> 01:02:35.317
So.
(sighing)

01:02:35.352 --> 01:02:37.719
And one of us has to be there,
of course.

01:02:37.788 --> 01:02:41.056
Mom, you don't need me there
for these depositions.

01:02:41.125 --> 01:02:42.635
Yeah, but you've
worked so hard on this

01:02:42.659 --> 01:02:44.693
and it seems like such a shame
to not have...

01:02:46.463 --> 01:02:49.364
And to tell you the truth, I was
looking forward to the drive.

01:02:49.433 --> 01:02:51.967
Just me and you.

01:02:52.002 --> 01:02:54.536
I miss spending time with you.

01:02:54.605 --> 01:02:56.605
I know, Mom, me too.

01:02:59.643 --> 01:03:02.177
All right, well, keep me posted.

01:03:02.212 --> 01:03:03.512
I'll be back tomorrow.

01:03:03.547 --> 01:03:05.781
All right.

01:03:15.359 --> 01:03:16.658
Hey.
Hey, where you been?

01:03:16.693 --> 01:03:18.360
We got to get ready.
We're starting soon.

01:03:18.428 --> 01:03:19.939
Yeah, I know. I'm sorry, I just
had to stop by the office.

01:03:19.963 --> 01:03:21.241
But I just have one other thing
I need to do.

01:03:21.265 --> 01:03:23.031
Wait! No, no. What?

01:03:23.100 --> 01:03:24.332
Don't worry!
Emma!

01:03:24.368 --> 01:03:26.468
I'll be back in time!

01:03:35.112 --> 01:03:36.812
College Administrator:
All right, Vera.

01:03:36.847 --> 01:03:40.515
The Samuel R. Baxter Scholarship
will be awarded every September.

01:03:41.952 --> 01:03:43.585
Great. That's exactly
what I wanted.

01:03:43.620 --> 01:03:46.021
(phone buzzing)

01:03:59.102 --> 01:04:00.468
Hey, how's it going?

01:04:00.504 --> 01:04:02.003
Sarah.

01:04:02.039 --> 01:04:05.040
You must be Nick.

01:04:05.108 --> 01:04:06.041
Yeah?

01:04:06.109 --> 01:04:08.310
I'm, uh, Dan Parkers.

01:04:08.345 --> 01:04:10.045
Oh, nice to meet you.
Emma's dad.

01:04:10.113 --> 01:04:11.513
Uh, where is she?

01:04:11.582 --> 01:04:13.181
Don't worry, she'll be here.

01:04:13.250 --> 01:04:15.517
Oh, yeah, that's what everyone
keeps telling me.

01:04:15.586 --> 01:04:18.119
Good morning, everyone.

01:04:18.155 --> 01:04:20.922
Welcome to the
Westford Christmas Festival

01:04:20.958 --> 01:04:23.124
ice sculpting competition!

01:04:23.160 --> 01:04:25.994
(cheering)

01:04:26.029 --> 01:04:28.430
I'm here, I'm here.

01:04:28.465 --> 01:04:30.632
Talk about timing.
Sorry I'm late.

01:04:30.667 --> 01:04:32.534
Good luck, you two.

01:04:32.603 --> 01:04:34.436
Thanks, Dad.

01:04:34.471 --> 01:04:36.482
Each team member is permitted
a total carving time of...

01:04:36.506 --> 01:04:38.473
You okay?

01:04:38.508 --> 01:04:39.975
Yeah. Yeah. We're doing this.

01:04:40.010 --> 01:04:41.810
Ice blocks that are
in their area.

01:04:41.845 --> 01:04:46.581
Sculptures must be five feet
tall but no more than 10 feet.

01:04:46.617 --> 01:04:50.151
And then on Christmas Eve day,
the judges will pick a winner.

01:04:52.022 --> 01:04:52.988
Is everybody ready?

01:04:53.023 --> 01:04:54.789
(cheering)

01:04:54.825 --> 01:04:55.902
I said, "Is everybody ready?"

01:04:55.926 --> 01:04:56.858
(cheering)

01:04:56.927 --> 01:04:58.293
On your marks.

01:04:58.328 --> 01:04:59.928
Get set.

01:04:59.963 --> 01:05:01.329
Go!

01:05:01.365 --> 01:05:04.833
(cheering)

01:05:05.869 --> 01:05:08.136
Let's do this.

01:05:11.742 --> 01:05:13.141
We just need to make sure

01:05:13.176 --> 01:05:15.076
we have enough clearance
for the lights. Right?

01:05:15.112 --> 01:05:17.846
Let's get started.
Just like that, huh?

01:05:22.152 --> 01:05:23.118
Do you know what
they're sculpting?

01:05:23.153 --> 01:05:25.020
I have no idea.

01:05:25.088 --> 01:05:27.188
They said it was a surprise.

01:05:27.257 --> 01:05:28.623
Come on, Emma!

01:05:28.659 --> 01:05:31.860
Yeah, then we'll just
stack it on top.

01:05:34.798 --> 01:05:36.631
Double the check
the measurements, right?

01:05:36.667 --> 01:05:39.000
We're good to drop?

01:05:39.069 --> 01:05:40.268
Okay, perfect. Got it.

01:05:40.304 --> 01:05:43.071
Thanks. We got it!

01:06:10.167 --> 01:06:18.167
<i>â™ª</i>

01:06:18.909 --> 01:06:20.275
You have no idea

01:06:20.310 --> 01:06:23.678
how enchanting you look
with a saw in your hand.

01:06:23.747 --> 01:06:24.779
Wow.

01:06:24.815 --> 01:06:26.348
Is... is that what I think it is?

01:06:26.416 --> 01:06:27.682
I caught her before she closed.

01:06:27.751 --> 01:06:31.052
Oh, thank you, thank you,
thank you.

01:06:31.088 --> 01:06:33.722
I forgot how cold it gets.

01:06:33.757 --> 01:06:35.868
Yeah. So, have you had a chance
to check out the competition?

01:06:35.892 --> 01:06:36.825
Unh-unh.

01:06:36.893 --> 01:06:38.827
You know?

01:06:38.895 --> 01:06:39.828
I think we're holding our own.

01:06:39.896 --> 01:06:41.796
Yeah?
Yeah.

01:06:41.832 --> 01:06:44.666
So, you know, if you want to,
um, get warm, go home,

01:06:44.735 --> 01:06:46.101
rest up for a couple hours.

01:06:46.136 --> 01:06:48.136
I'm okay.

01:06:49.406 --> 01:06:51.306
You really love this.

01:06:51.341 --> 01:06:52.440
(sighing)

01:06:52.476 --> 01:06:53.808
This.

01:06:53.844 --> 01:06:56.611
This always meant Christmas
to me.

01:06:56.646 --> 01:07:00.382
I love all the rest,
the trees and the...

01:07:00.417 --> 01:07:03.218
lights, and the music.

01:07:03.253 --> 01:07:08.089
But this... this is
what made it special.

01:07:08.125 --> 01:07:10.725
Ice sculpting has always been
a part of who I am.

01:07:12.329 --> 01:07:16.998
And now I needed it to help me
decide who I want to be.

01:07:18.769 --> 01:07:20.769
I like who you are right now.

01:07:22.739 --> 01:07:25.106
Yeah. But there's always
been this plan.

01:07:25.142 --> 01:07:28.243
And I'm just... I'm not sure
about that anymore.

01:07:28.278 --> 01:07:30.412
So we'll make a new plan.

01:07:31.648 --> 01:07:33.915
(phone ringing)
Oh.

01:07:36.987 --> 01:07:39.054
Oh.

01:07:39.089 --> 01:07:40.655
They sent the results.

01:07:40.724 --> 01:07:42.590
The results?

01:07:42.626 --> 01:07:44.759
For the bar exam.

01:07:45.829 --> 01:07:47.495
I passed.

01:07:47.564 --> 01:07:50.465
You passed the bar exam!

01:07:50.500 --> 01:07:51.577
Oh, my gosh! That's amazing!

01:07:51.601 --> 01:07:52.734
Congratulations.

01:07:52.769 --> 01:07:54.769
Yeah. No, than... thank you.

01:07:54.805 --> 01:07:57.972
Yeah. Okay. I'm not an expert.

01:07:58.041 --> 01:07:59.552
But, uh, it's supposed to be
a good thing, right?

01:07:59.576 --> 01:08:02.110
Yeah, no. I'm...
I'm really excited.

01:08:02.145 --> 01:08:03.611
Okay, well you don't
seem like it.

01:08:03.647 --> 01:08:04.879
Don't you want to be a lawyer?

01:08:04.915 --> 01:08:06.247
I do.

01:08:06.283 --> 01:08:09.050
Of course. I mean,
why else would I...

01:08:09.086 --> 01:08:10.763
go to school and knock myself
off for three years.

01:08:10.787 --> 01:08:12.120
I don't know.

01:08:12.155 --> 01:08:14.422
Maybe it's because
a part of that big plan,

01:08:14.458 --> 01:08:16.291
the one you worked
your whole life for.

01:08:16.326 --> 01:08:18.426
It is a great plan.

01:08:23.533 --> 01:08:25.033
It makes a lot of sense.

01:08:25.068 --> 01:08:27.635
I mean, my mom and I are
going to be partners now.

01:08:27.703 --> 01:08:30.772
So, what, you don't want
your name on the door?

01:08:31.908 --> 01:08:34.309
You know what? I...

01:08:34.377 --> 01:08:35.410
I should take a break.

01:08:35.444 --> 01:08:36.978
Emma.

01:08:37.046 --> 01:08:39.948
Remember what you told me
about being an artist?

01:08:39.983 --> 01:08:42.317
I don't hold a candle to you.

01:08:45.755 --> 01:08:47.988
Thanks.

01:08:49.225 --> 01:08:51.392
Thanks for the coffee.

01:09:13.116 --> 01:09:15.550
That looks like
a big block of ice.

01:09:23.960 --> 01:09:25.960
(phone buzzing)

01:09:28.798 --> 01:09:29.930
Hi, Mom.

01:09:29.966 --> 01:09:32.433
Hi, honey. I'm just checking in.

01:09:32.469 --> 01:09:34.402
How did everything go
at the school with Vera?

01:09:34.437 --> 01:09:36.738
Yeah. Um... great.

01:09:36.773 --> 01:09:39.474
Great. They're all ready to go.

01:09:39.542 --> 01:09:40.475
And she's really excited.

01:09:40.544 --> 01:09:41.776
<i>Wonderful.</i>

01:09:41.810 --> 01:09:43.444
Thank you for
taking care of that.

01:09:43.479 --> 01:09:45.613
Of course. Um...

01:09:45.649 --> 01:09:48.049
How did the depositions go?

01:09:48.084 --> 01:09:49.884
It went really well.

01:09:49.920 --> 01:09:52.187
In fact, we finished early
and I'm leaving now.

01:09:52.221 --> 01:09:54.722
<i>I'll tell you all about it
when I get home.</i>

01:09:54.758 --> 01:09:56.424
Sounds good.

01:09:56.459 --> 01:09:58.626
You know, I just... I just
wanted to ask you something.

01:09:58.695 --> 01:10:00.094
<i>Sure.</i>

01:10:00.130 --> 01:10:02.530
I was thinking about
what we said

01:10:02.566 --> 01:10:05.200
about not spending
enough time together.

01:10:05.235 --> 01:10:07.235
<i>And I was really hoping</i>

01:10:07.270 --> 01:10:09.737
<i>we might have dinner at home
tonight just the three of us.</i>

01:10:11.575 --> 01:10:13.686
<i>I mean, I don't know, maybe
turn on the tree lights.</i>

01:10:13.710 --> 01:10:15.910
And put on the music.

01:10:15.946 --> 01:10:19.747
And maybe watch an old Christmas
movie like we used to.

01:10:19.783 --> 01:10:20.748
How does that sound?

01:10:20.784 --> 01:10:23.284
Uh, tonight?

01:10:23.353 --> 01:10:25.687
Oh, unless of course
you have other plans.

01:10:27.224 --> 01:10:28.890
No, you know what?

01:10:28.925 --> 01:10:30.191
Mom, tonight sounds great.

01:10:30.227 --> 01:10:31.392
<i>Okay, good.</i>

01:10:31.428 --> 01:10:32.393
(giggling)

01:10:32.429 --> 01:10:34.028
I'll call your dad

01:10:34.064 --> 01:10:35.908
and I'll tell him there'll be
three of us for dinner.

01:10:35.932 --> 01:10:38.032
Great. I'll see you then.

01:10:38.068 --> 01:10:40.068
<i>Okay. Bye, sweetheart.</i>

01:10:49.246 --> 01:10:50.678
Sorry, I fell asleep.

01:10:50.714 --> 01:10:52.380
That's okay.
I thought that was the point.

01:10:52.415 --> 01:10:54.716
That's...

01:10:54.751 --> 01:10:56.184
Yeah. Did you get some rest?

01:10:56.219 --> 01:10:58.753
Yeah, I got a couple hours.
I'm good to go.

01:10:58.788 --> 01:11:00.755
Great.

01:11:00.790 --> 01:11:02.690
You tell your parents
the good news?

01:11:02.726 --> 01:11:04.726
Uh, not yet.

01:11:04.761 --> 01:11:06.628
When are you going to tell 'em?

01:11:06.696 --> 01:11:09.030
Tonight at dinner.

01:11:09.065 --> 01:11:10.365
Tonight?

01:11:10.400 --> 01:11:12.533
Yeah. No, don't worry.

01:11:12.569 --> 01:11:16.337
I won't be gone long.
We'll finish in time still.

01:11:16.373 --> 01:11:18.217
Yeah, right. I'm sure they're
going to be really excited

01:11:18.241 --> 01:11:20.341
to hear the big news.

01:11:33.957 --> 01:11:35.890
Emma.

01:11:35.925 --> 01:11:38.026
Emma! Emma! Wait!

01:11:39.095 --> 01:11:41.062
I was...

01:11:41.097 --> 01:11:42.697
If you hadn't...
It's okay.

01:11:42.732 --> 01:11:44.165
We can fix it.
Stopped me.

01:11:44.200 --> 01:11:46.834
Look. Lonny and Sarah
brought some cider.

01:11:46.870 --> 01:11:48.836
Let's take a break
and then we'll fix it.

01:11:48.872 --> 01:11:49.837
I wasn't even paying attention.

01:11:49.873 --> 01:11:51.205
If you hadn't stopped me

01:11:51.241 --> 01:11:53.508
I could've ruined
the whole sculpture.

01:11:53.543 --> 01:11:54.543
But you didn't.

01:11:54.577 --> 01:11:55.743
It's all right.

01:11:55.779 --> 01:11:56.844
It's not all right.

01:11:56.880 --> 01:11:58.446
Nothing's all right.

01:11:58.515 --> 01:12:00.226
I keep trying to figure out
the right thing to do

01:12:00.250 --> 01:12:03.918
but I just keep
doing everything wrong.

01:12:03.953 --> 01:12:08.423
The sculpture, my parents,
my career.

01:12:09.426 --> 01:12:10.591
You.

01:12:10.660 --> 01:12:13.895
Look around.

01:12:13.930 --> 01:12:14.896
Here.

01:12:14.931 --> 01:12:16.397
Look at all these people

01:12:16.433 --> 01:12:18.533
doing something that
they thought they lost.

01:12:18.568 --> 01:12:20.568
You did this.

01:12:25.675 --> 01:12:27.915
You made Christmas a little more
special for all of them.

01:12:30.613 --> 01:12:32.613
And a lot more special for me.

01:12:34.884 --> 01:12:36.384
Really?

01:12:36.419 --> 01:12:38.486
Yeah, I was...

01:12:38.521 --> 01:12:40.855
I was ready to give up
on all this.

01:12:41.891 --> 01:12:43.891
But you changed my mind.

01:12:45.695 --> 01:12:49.831
And... I'm not letting you give
up on what you really want.

01:12:57.774 --> 01:13:00.575
What I want...

01:13:00.610 --> 01:13:01.576
it's not part of that plan.

01:13:01.611 --> 01:13:03.111
Oh, yeah?

01:13:03.179 --> 01:13:05.513
Then it's time for a new plan.

01:13:05.548 --> 01:13:07.181
Okay?

01:13:07.217 --> 01:13:09.417
Look inside your heart, Emma.

01:13:09.486 --> 01:13:11.986
Find the thing
that you really love.

01:13:14.190 --> 01:13:17.024
And that's how you know
you found the right choice.

01:13:23.099 --> 01:13:25.533
Carol:
Oh, Emma, that's wonderful news.

01:13:25.568 --> 01:13:28.603
Congratulations, honey,
on passing the bar.

01:13:28.671 --> 01:13:30.671
We are so proud of you.

01:13:32.609 --> 01:13:34.742
Thanks, guys.

01:13:34.811 --> 01:13:36.511
It's still kind of sinking in.

01:13:36.546 --> 01:13:38.646
Well, I never had any doubt.

01:13:38.681 --> 01:13:40.515
But this makes it official.

01:13:40.550 --> 01:13:44.252
So, to Emma Parkers,
attorney at law.

01:13:44.320 --> 01:13:46.888
To Emma!

01:13:46.923 --> 01:13:48.256
Oh, can I give it to her now?

01:13:48.324 --> 01:13:49.724
It's supposed to be
for Christmas.

01:13:49.759 --> 01:13:51.259
Close enough.

01:13:51.327 --> 01:13:52.894
Give me what?

01:13:52.929 --> 01:13:54.595
(laughing)

01:13:54.664 --> 01:13:56.664
Your mother.

01:13:58.034 --> 01:13:59.066
What is it?

01:13:59.102 --> 01:14:01.702
Open it and see.

01:14:04.340 --> 01:14:06.007
Partners.

01:14:06.042 --> 01:14:07.542
Just like we planned.

01:14:07.577 --> 01:14:10.711
Just like we planned.

01:14:12.182 --> 01:14:13.147
Emma?

01:14:13.183 --> 01:14:15.183
What is it, honey? What's wrong?

01:14:17.520 --> 01:14:20.188
I need to show you something.

01:14:34.871 --> 01:14:37.572
Do... do you know
what this is all about?

01:14:37.640 --> 01:14:40.074
Maybe we'll just let
Emma explain it.

01:14:47.684 --> 01:14:49.851
Mom. Nick Claiborne.

01:14:49.886 --> 01:14:51.719
Nick, my mother.

01:14:51.754 --> 01:14:52.965
It's nice to finally meet you,
Mrs. Parkers.

01:14:52.989 --> 01:14:53.921
Hello.
Hi.

01:14:53.990 --> 01:14:56.023
Hey, Dan.

01:14:56.059 --> 01:14:57.492
Hey, Nick. Looks great.

01:14:57.527 --> 01:14:59.660
Yeah. It's coming along.

01:14:59.696 --> 01:15:00.995
Um, excuse me, I'm sorry.

01:15:01.030 --> 01:15:04.365
Maybe because I'm freezing,
but, uh,

01:15:04.400 --> 01:15:07.134
I'd really like to know
exactly what's going on here.

01:15:11.441 --> 01:15:14.308
But I decided to enter the
ice sculpting competition.

01:15:14.344 --> 01:15:16.978
Nick and I are partners
and this is our sculpture.

01:15:18.982 --> 01:15:21.015
(laughing) Honey.

01:15:21.084 --> 01:15:22.617
You didn't need to
keep that a secret,

01:15:22.652 --> 01:15:23.762
I think it's good for you
to have hobbies.

01:15:23.786 --> 01:15:25.486
And, I mean,

01:15:25.555 --> 01:15:28.422
especially ones you can schedule
around a busy law practice.

01:15:30.159 --> 01:15:31.926
(sighing)

01:15:31.961 --> 01:15:34.395
That's the thing,
I'm not sure I want to do that.

01:15:36.633 --> 01:15:38.633
Wait? What do you mean?

01:15:41.404 --> 01:15:44.171
Look, Mom.

01:15:44.240 --> 01:15:46.574
I don't think
I want to be a lawyer.

01:15:46.609 --> 01:15:50.077
I'm not sure I ever really did.

01:15:51.414 --> 01:15:54.048
But...

01:15:54.083 --> 01:15:57.418
I mean, this has been our plan
since...

01:15:57.453 --> 01:15:59.487
since you were a little girl.

01:15:59.556 --> 01:16:01.622
It was your plan, Mom.

01:16:01.658 --> 01:16:04.091
And it was a good one.

01:16:04.127 --> 01:16:06.928
It was. It just...

01:16:06.963 --> 01:16:07.929
Not the right one.

01:16:07.964 --> 01:16:10.164
Not for me.

01:16:15.505 --> 01:16:17.505
Are you sure you want to

01:16:17.574 --> 01:16:20.608
walk away from everything
you've worked so hard for?

01:16:20.643 --> 01:16:21.742
Dan.

01:16:21.778 --> 01:16:23.411
Tell her. What...

01:16:23.446 --> 01:16:25.780
Oh, honey.

01:16:25.815 --> 01:16:29.417
We always said that the most
important thing we wanted

01:16:29.452 --> 01:16:30.952
is for Emma to be happy.

01:16:30.987 --> 01:16:33.254
And this is what I love.

01:16:33.289 --> 01:16:37.425
But a career in law
has a future.

01:16:37.460 --> 01:16:38.426
And...

01:16:38.461 --> 01:16:40.127
Mrs. Parkers.

01:16:40.163 --> 01:16:43.264
It's not more than just a
future, it's about passion.

01:16:43.299 --> 01:16:46.067
I mean, this whole
ice sculpting competition

01:16:46.102 --> 01:16:47.702
would've been cancelled
this year.

01:16:47.737 --> 01:16:49.971
Yes. I know.

01:16:50.039 --> 01:16:52.907
Well, if it wasn't for Emma
none of this would've happened.

01:16:52.942 --> 01:16:54.976
She raised all the money.

01:16:55.979 --> 01:16:57.378
Is that true?

01:16:57.413 --> 01:16:59.814
Well, yeah. But I... I mean,
I had a lot of help

01:16:59.882 --> 01:17:03.217
with Sarah and Nick and Dad
even made a few phone calls.

01:17:03.252 --> 01:17:04.885
Oh, so...

01:17:04.921 --> 01:17:06.721
Oh, you did know?

01:17:06.756 --> 01:17:09.991
Well, I made a couple of calls.

01:17:11.761 --> 01:17:16.263
Emma, sculpting ice
isn't exactly a career.

01:17:19.869 --> 01:17:22.470
I know. But...

01:17:24.540 --> 01:17:26.107
It felt right.

01:17:26.142 --> 01:17:27.541
Working for a good cause,

01:17:27.577 --> 01:17:29.355
bringing people together
to help make it happen.

01:17:29.379 --> 01:17:32.480
Seeing how happy
it made everyone.

01:17:34.317 --> 01:17:35.628
I mean, I know I still have to
figure out the rest of my life

01:17:35.652 --> 01:17:39.654
but I like the way this felt.

01:17:41.090 --> 01:17:43.324
And I'm just...

01:17:43.393 --> 01:17:46.794
I'm not sure I'm ready to make
up my mind about being a lawyer.

01:17:48.698 --> 01:17:51.065
But whatever I choose...

01:17:51.100 --> 01:17:53.567
right now?

01:17:53.603 --> 01:17:55.970
This is what I want.

01:17:57.740 --> 01:17:59.974
This is my Christmas.

01:18:04.047 --> 01:18:06.247
Well.

01:18:06.282 --> 01:18:08.382
Your father's right.

01:18:10.620 --> 01:18:13.621
The most important thing
is your happiness.

01:18:16.426 --> 01:18:21.062
But, oh, my dear, you could be
one powerful good lawyer.

01:18:22.398 --> 01:18:24.298
So, you're not disappointed?

01:18:24.367 --> 01:18:27.735
Honey, we would never be
disappointed in you.

01:18:27.770 --> 01:18:30.371
And let's face it,
it's not exactly a surprise.

01:18:31.607 --> 01:18:33.140
What?

01:18:33.209 --> 01:18:35.109
Well, every Christmas
for all these years

01:18:35.144 --> 01:18:37.878
you and your father
have been completely loopy

01:18:37.914 --> 01:18:40.047
about this competition.

01:18:40.083 --> 01:18:42.883
I mean, it wasn't like you were
just going to give it up.

01:18:42.919 --> 01:18:45.386
So, you knew I had second
thoughts about being a lawyer?

01:18:45.421 --> 01:18:49.190
Well, I mean, I had hope
that once you did the bar

01:18:49.225 --> 01:18:51.425
you'd be ready to, you know,
give it a chance.

01:18:51.461 --> 01:18:54.295
But then I thought
what you really needed

01:18:54.363 --> 01:18:57.765
was the chance to finally
decide for yourself.

01:18:59.469 --> 01:19:02.703
Am I missing something here?

01:19:02.739 --> 01:19:04.305
You and me both.

01:19:04.373 --> 01:19:06.974
How was she going to decide
what she really wanted

01:19:07.043 --> 01:19:09.710
if the competition was
cancelled?

01:19:09.746 --> 01:19:11.746
Wait.

01:19:11.781 --> 01:19:14.081
You donated the $10,000?

01:19:18.020 --> 01:19:20.221
I...

01:19:20.256 --> 01:19:23.691
I just wanted you
to have the choice...

01:19:23.726 --> 01:19:25.893
to do the thing
you love the most.

01:19:29.799 --> 01:19:31.966
Mom.

01:19:34.604 --> 01:19:36.570
Thank you.

01:19:40.910 --> 01:19:44.178
And besides, you were right,
it was for a very good cause.

01:19:44.213 --> 01:19:46.213
My daughter's Christmas.

01:19:47.950 --> 01:19:48.994
Promise you guys will both
be here tomorrow

01:19:49.018 --> 01:19:50.162
when they announce the winner?

01:19:50.186 --> 01:19:52.453
Wouldn't miss it for the world.

01:19:52.522 --> 01:19:54.221
Oh.

01:19:54.257 --> 01:19:56.357
But now, you two better get busy

01:19:56.392 --> 01:19:59.093
because you've
a lot of work to do.

01:19:59.128 --> 01:20:01.362
Yeah, we got a long night
ahead of us.

01:20:01.397 --> 01:20:03.531
I'm going to enjoy
every minute of it.

01:20:16.045 --> 01:20:23.083
<i>â™ª</i>

01:20:23.119 --> 01:20:25.052
How much time?

01:20:25.087 --> 01:20:27.054
It's almost there.

01:20:27.089 --> 01:20:28.600
Harvey:
All right, ladies and gentlemen,
let's hear it for the sculptors.

01:20:28.624 --> 01:20:31.091
They've been working hard
for three days.

01:20:31.127 --> 01:20:33.494
(cheering)

01:20:33.529 --> 01:20:34.873
Send them some energy. Come on,
ladies and gentlemen!

01:20:34.897 --> 01:20:36.430
Give it to them!
Give it to them!

01:20:36.499 --> 01:20:38.399
Send them some energy!

01:20:38.434 --> 01:20:39.700
(cheering)

01:20:39.735 --> 01:20:41.569
I don't know about you,

01:20:41.604 --> 01:20:44.205
but I think this has been the
best ice sculpting competition

01:20:44.240 --> 01:20:45.406
we've ever had.

01:20:45.441 --> 01:20:47.942
(cheering)

01:21:01.157 --> 01:21:03.357
Look at those beautiful
sculptures!

01:21:05.194 --> 01:21:07.161
How much time?

01:21:07.196 --> 01:21:09.263
Oh, it's getting close.

01:21:10.833 --> 01:21:13.400
Hey! Focus.

01:21:13.436 --> 01:21:14.847
We're on the last few minutes
here, folks.

01:21:14.871 --> 01:21:17.338
What do you think?
Aren't they beautiful?

01:21:17.373 --> 01:21:19.707
(cheering)

01:21:26.916 --> 01:21:28.883
We're getting down to the wire.

01:21:29.919 --> 01:21:31.318
In five...

01:21:31.354 --> 01:21:33.921
All:
Four, three,

01:21:33.990 --> 01:21:36.223
two, one!

01:21:36.259 --> 01:21:37.591
(horn blaring)

01:21:37.660 --> 01:21:39.326
And that's it, time's up,
tools down!

01:21:39.362 --> 01:21:40.561
Hands up.

01:21:40.596 --> 01:21:43.664
Can I get the judges
to the stage

01:21:43.699 --> 01:21:45.699
with their score cards please?

01:21:47.937 --> 01:21:51.038
I just want you to know
that no matter what happens

01:21:51.073 --> 01:21:53.908
you made every Christmas wish
I had come true.

01:21:53.943 --> 01:21:56.710
Emma, you are my Christmas wish.

01:21:58.314 --> 01:22:00.192
Okay, folks, the judges have
made their decisions.

01:22:00.216 --> 01:22:01.749
And...

01:22:01.817 --> 01:22:03.417
it's unanimous.

01:22:03.486 --> 01:22:04.718
Unanimous?

01:22:04.754 --> 01:22:06.487
Harvey:
Folks, I'm pleased to announce

01:22:06.522 --> 01:22:10.190
that the winner of the Westford
ice sculpting competition...

01:22:11.661 --> 01:22:13.994
is Emma Parkers
and Nick Claiborne!

01:22:14.030 --> 01:22:15.996
(cheering)

01:22:16.032 --> 01:22:18.565
For their sculpture called
"Memories of Westford".

01:22:18.601 --> 01:22:20.901
(cheering)

01:22:20.937 --> 01:22:21.902
We did it.

01:22:21.938 --> 01:22:22.903
We did.

01:22:22.939 --> 01:22:25.539
(cheering)

01:22:28.177 --> 01:22:29.710
Oh, congratulations.

01:22:29.745 --> 01:22:30.978
It's beautiful.

01:22:31.013 --> 01:22:33.380
Well done, Nick.

01:22:34.383 --> 01:22:36.417
(laughing) We did it.

01:22:36.485 --> 01:22:38.018
I knew you could do it.

01:22:38.054 --> 01:22:39.386
Way to go, Nick.

01:22:39.422 --> 01:22:41.221
Oh, my gosh.

01:22:41.257 --> 01:22:43.324
Congrats. Wow.

01:22:43.359 --> 01:22:44.825
Congratulations.

01:22:44.860 --> 01:22:47.194
And, listen,
I meant what I said.

01:22:47.229 --> 01:22:49.141
If you ever want to test
your talents outside of law

01:22:49.165 --> 01:22:51.565
we can certainly use you
at the town.

01:22:51.600 --> 01:22:52.933
Oh.

01:22:53.002 --> 01:22:55.669
Well, I just might
take you up on that.

01:22:55.705 --> 01:22:58.372
(laughing)

01:23:01.544 --> 01:23:02.876
What are you doing?

01:23:02.912 --> 01:23:04.211
Da da dun nah!

01:23:04.246 --> 01:23:05.679
(singing fanfare)

01:23:05.715 --> 01:23:08.382
(laughing)

01:23:09.752 --> 01:23:11.352
Merry Christmas.

01:23:11.387 --> 01:23:14.321
Merry Christmas, Nick.

01:23:23.466 --> 01:23:31.466
