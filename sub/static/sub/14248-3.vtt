WEBVTT

00:06.006 --> 00:10.375
Holding course 351 mark 10.
Warp 7.

00:10.443 --> 00:13.412
We'll be passing a red dwarf
system in 40 minutes.

00:13.480 --> 00:15.744
l can't tell yet if there
are any M-Class planets.

00:19.819 --> 00:20.945
You ready?

00:21.021 --> 00:21.988
No, l really want

00:22.055 --> 00:23.716
to get on that transtator
assembly diagnostic.

00:24.758 --> 00:26.851
Harry, l can't do this alone.

00:26.926 --> 00:28.188
Sorry.

00:28.261 --> 00:30.593
Oh, you're making a big mistake.

00:30.663 --> 00:32.290
Can't you see
what's going to happen?

00:34.834 --> 00:38.668
We're the only humans
out here, Harry.

00:38.738 --> 00:41.036
People are going
to start pairing off

00:41.107 --> 00:42.802
and if we don't get
to the Delaney sisters

00:42.876 --> 00:44.810
in Stellar Cartography soon,
somebody else will.

00:44.878 --> 00:46.846
l got a girl back home.

00:46.913 --> 00:48.244
So what?
l got five.

00:48.314 --> 00:50.839
l plan on seeing mine again.

00:50.917 --> 00:53.715
Harry, Harry, Harry,
Harry, Harry.

00:53.787 --> 00:55.482
You really think
she's going to wait for you?

00:55.555 --> 00:56.647
l hope so.

00:56.723 --> 00:58.315
Let her go.

00:58.391 --> 01:01.258
Let her have a husband
and kids and a good life,

01:01.327 --> 01:03.318
while you and l have
the Delaney sisters.

01:03.396 --> 01:06.923
l told you, l need to run
a transtator diagnostic.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.627
You need to run
a self-diagnostic.

01:08.701 --> 01:10.669
Look, they come as a pair.

01:10.737 --> 01:13.069
lt's a double date or no date.

01:13.139 --> 01:15.607
Come on.

01:15.675 --> 01:17.575
l told them all about you.

01:17.644 --> 01:20.078
What did you tell them
about me?

01:20.146 --> 01:22.376
Oh, well, for one thing,

01:22.449 --> 01:24.940
how you broke
the single-pilot speed record

01:25.018 --> 01:26.076
at the Academy.

01:26.152 --> 01:27.710
Record?

01:27.787 --> 01:29.584
l never broke any record.

01:29.656 --> 01:31.715
And who are they going
to check it with?

01:37.664 --> 01:38.631
Report!

01:38.698 --> 01:40.097
We're at the leading edge
of a shock wave.

01:42.000 --> 01:48.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:57.050 --> 01:59.245
Minor hull breach on Deck 3,
contained.

01:59.319 --> 02:00.843
Shields are holding.

02:00.920 --> 02:02.854
Engineering is undamaged,
Captain.

02:02.922 --> 02:04.514
All systems operational.

02:05.825 --> 02:09.591
Mr. Paris, can you identify
the source of the wave?

02:09.662 --> 02:12.062
l'm not sure.

02:12.132 --> 02:14.191
Scanners are picking
up a debris cloud

02:14.267 --> 02:16.633
in the red dwarf system
we're approaching.

02:16.703 --> 02:19.069
lt consists of differentially
charged polaric ions,

02:19.139 --> 02:20.163
Captain.

02:22.342 --> 02:24.810
Differentially charged?

02:24.878 --> 02:28.177
That would suggest
a massive detonation.

02:28.248 --> 02:30.876
Are you familiar
with any intelligent life-forms

02:30.950 --> 02:32.440
in this system, Mr. Neelix?

02:32.519 --> 02:33.986
Familiar?

02:34.087 --> 02:36.715
Ah, not exactly, uh, ''familiar.''

02:36.789 --> 02:39.690
Considerably less
than ''familiar,'' actually.

02:42.295 --> 02:43.762
Adjust course to investigate.

02:43.830 --> 02:44.797
Aye, Captain.

02:51.671 --> 02:53.434
Entering the system, Captain.

02:53.506 --> 02:55.701
Heading 010 mark 4.

02:55.775 --> 02:56.742
Kes...

02:56.809 --> 02:58.834
what are you doing here?

02:58.912 --> 03:00.777
l had to know.

03:00.847 --> 03:03.281
Know? Know what?

03:03.349 --> 03:05.510
The origin of the shock wave
is an M-Class planet, Captain.

03:05.585 --> 03:06.779
We're within visual range.

03:06.853 --> 03:07.945
On screen.

03:09.389 --> 03:13.018
All vegetation on the planet
has been destroyed.

03:13.092 --> 03:14.320
No satellite system in orbit.

03:14.394 --> 03:15.486
No evidence of spacecraft.

03:15.562 --> 03:16.824
Life signs?

03:16.896 --> 03:18.261
-None.
-None.

03:18.331 --> 03:19.662
But the polaric radiation

03:19.732 --> 03:21.427
may be interfering
with the scanners.

03:21.501 --> 03:22.968
Take us into orbit.

03:23.036 --> 03:25.630
Density patterns on the surface
show artificial waterways

03:25.705 --> 03:27.434
and a global aqueduct system.

03:28.441 --> 03:31.239
There is a civilization
down there, Captain.

03:31.311 --> 03:33.643
Or there was.

03:33.713 --> 03:35.578
What do we know
about surface conditions?

03:35.648 --> 03:37.775
Radiation is within
acceptable levels.

03:37.850 --> 03:39.442
Atmosphere: breathable.

03:39.519 --> 03:42.079
Mr. Paris, Tuvok,
you're with me.

03:42.155 --> 03:43.645
Ms. Torres, meet us
in Transporter Room 2.

03:43.723 --> 03:44.655
On my way.

03:44.724 --> 03:46.555
Commander, you have the Bridge.

06:17.944 --> 06:21.641
The entire surface of the planet
was just... seared.

06:21.714 --> 06:24.842
There was a chain reaction
in subspace,

06:24.917 --> 06:26.817
very likely ignited
by the detonation

06:26.886 --> 06:29.150
of one or more
polaric ion devices.

06:29.222 --> 06:30.780
lf that's what happened,

06:30.857 --> 06:32.620
the people here
never had a chance.

06:32.692 --> 06:35.490
They're gone... vaporized.

06:35.561 --> 06:38.029
Everything organic
has basically been obliterated.

06:38.097 --> 06:39.724
At least it happened quickly.

06:39.799 --> 06:40.925
Polaric detonation

06:41.033 --> 06:43.194
would have swept through
this city in seconds.

06:43.269 --> 06:45.237
lt recalls
the Chaltok lV incident.

06:45.304 --> 06:46.771
Chaltok lV?

06:46.839 --> 06:48.773
A Romulan research colony
was nearly destroyed

06:48.841 --> 06:50.809
during a testing
of one of these devices.

06:50.877 --> 06:54.244
lt led to the Polaric
Test Ban Treaty of 2268.

06:54.313 --> 06:58.909
So... we're looking
at the end of a war.

06:58.985 --> 07:01.510
l wonder who won.

07:01.587 --> 07:03.646
l'm not so sure there was a war.

07:03.723 --> 07:05.520
Look at these readings,
B'Elanna.

07:10.163 --> 07:12.188
Polaric ion concentrations

07:12.265 --> 07:15.428
are so high, l can't get
an accurate reading.

07:15.501 --> 07:17.401
l'd say these conduits
were the source

07:17.470 --> 07:18.664
of the explosion, wouldn't you?

07:18.738 --> 07:22.003
A civilization powered
by polaric ion energy?

07:23.042 --> 07:25.010
That's what it looks like.

07:25.077 --> 07:27.671
A time bomb
underneath every street,

07:27.747 --> 07:29.772
running into every home.

07:33.519 --> 07:36.010
What do you mean, you saw it?

07:36.088 --> 07:37.749
How could you see it?

07:37.824 --> 07:39.553
l don't know.

07:42.995 --> 07:44.519
What did you see?

07:47.800 --> 07:49.495
l saw them...

07:52.004 --> 07:53.232
burn...

07:55.775 --> 07:57.504
their bodies...

08:00.346 --> 08:02.610
ashes where they stood!

08:06.385 --> 08:08.819
You felt the shock wave
in your sleep.

08:08.888 --> 08:11.186
This is just your imagination.

08:11.257 --> 08:13.987
A strange coincidence.

08:14.060 --> 08:15.322
l don't think so.

08:15.394 --> 08:16.952
What else could it be?

08:17.029 --> 08:19.190
lt was...

08:19.265 --> 08:22.132
it was almost telepathic.

08:22.201 --> 08:27.503
Telepathy is a message,
words, a voice...

08:27.573 --> 08:32.010
What you're describing,
why, it's... almost like

08:32.078 --> 08:34.342
the visions of Drakina
Forest dwellers.

08:34.413 --> 08:36.381
Who?

08:36.448 --> 08:38.917
A tribe
with paranormal abilities.

08:38.985 --> 08:40.452
They can walk
into an empty room...

08:40.520 --> 08:44.320
Neelix, my ancestors
were said to have

08:44.390 --> 08:47.484
unusual mental abilities.

08:48.861 --> 08:51.227
No one believes those stories.

08:51.297 --> 08:53.925
l always have.

09:23.095 --> 09:24.562
Look.

09:24.630 --> 09:27.064
This may be some kind
of timepiece

09:27.133 --> 09:30.102
stopped at the moment
of the explosion.

09:35.942 --> 09:37.102
What was that?

09:37.176 --> 09:38.108
What?

09:39.145 --> 09:40.806
Didn't you hear that?

09:40.880 --> 09:43.348
Hear what, Lieutenant?

09:43.416 --> 09:44.906
Kids playing.

09:45.017 --> 09:46.177
They were as close to me as...

10:05.237 --> 10:07.364
l don't understand.

10:07.440 --> 10:11.877
l was here, in this square,
but there were people.

10:11.944 --> 10:13.844
You never left here, Tom.

10:13.913 --> 10:15.141
But l saw them.

10:15.214 --> 10:17.444
Lots of people.

10:17.516 --> 10:18.881
Children playing

10:18.951 --> 10:19.975
and the sun was shining.

10:20.052 --> 10:22.111
There was no evidence
of an explosion.

10:22.188 --> 10:23.951
Everyone was alive and happy.

10:24.023 --> 10:25.991
You were standing here
the whole time.

10:26.092 --> 10:28.720
Your central nervous system
is showing a temporal flux,

10:28.794 --> 10:30.762
but it's rapidly
returning to normal.

10:30.830 --> 10:32.923
The chain reaction has
shattered subspace, Captain.

10:32.999 --> 10:35.467
l want everyone to stand
exactly where they are.

10:35.534 --> 10:38.002
lf Tuvok's right,
there may be subspace fractures

10:38.070 --> 10:41.039
floating like icebergs
across the planet's surface.

10:41.107 --> 10:42.404
Away team to Voyager.

10:42.475 --> 10:43.407
Go ahead.

10:43.476 --> 10:44.443
Four to beam up.

10:49.181 --> 10:51.149
Tuvok, B'Elanna?

10:56.622 --> 10:58.317
Hey, calm down.

10:58.391 --> 10:59.824
lt's all right.

10:59.892 --> 11:01.416
Now what's the problem?

11:01.527 --> 11:02.824
l saw them!

11:02.862 --> 11:04.557
They appeared out of thin air!

11:04.630 --> 11:07.497
They're some kind of demons.

11:07.566 --> 11:09.329
l saw them with my own eyes.

11:09.402 --> 11:10.562
l'm sorry we startled him.

11:10.636 --> 11:11.762
We just came around the corner.

11:11.837 --> 11:13.429
They're lying!

11:13.506 --> 11:14.632
Shh, now.

11:14.707 --> 11:16.607
Calm down.
You've been reading

11:16.676 --> 11:18.871
too many of those Darkstorm
tales, young fellow.

11:18.944 --> 11:21.242
There's no such thing as demons.

11:21.313 --> 11:22.302
But l'm telling you...

11:22.381 --> 11:24.372
Ah, ah, ah, run along now.

11:24.450 --> 11:27.351
Have a confection bar
and calm down.

11:27.420 --> 11:31.186
All right, everybody,
back to your business.

11:31.257 --> 11:32.884
Nothing else to see here now.

11:34.694 --> 11:36.457
Oh, sorry about that.

11:36.529 --> 11:37.689
No problem.

11:37.763 --> 11:39.958
Who knows what gets
into their heads, huh?

11:40.032 --> 11:42.193
Oh, perhaps the
uniforms scared him.

11:42.268 --> 11:43.633
We're not from this area.

11:43.703 --> 11:45.500
Come in on
the Continental Transport?

11:45.571 --> 11:46.538
This morning.

11:46.605 --> 11:48.698
ls, uh, that
what they're wearing

11:48.774 --> 11:50.366
in Kalto province these days?

11:50.443 --> 11:53.742
Uh, this is, uh, a little
more formal than most.

11:53.813 --> 11:55.371
You know how it is
when you travel.

11:55.448 --> 11:57.143
We were actually looking
for a clothing shop.

11:57.216 --> 12:00.344
We thought we'd change
into something more appropriate.

12:00.419 --> 12:01.545
There's one right over there.

12:01.620 --> 12:03.645
l hope the rest of your stay
with us is more enjoyable.

12:05.357 --> 12:07.587
l wish l could say it will be.

12:16.435 --> 12:18.403
Need a timepiece?

12:19.772 --> 12:21.205
Maybe you could help me.

12:21.273 --> 12:23.833
l'm from... Kalto province.

12:23.909 --> 12:25.934
l'm not used to your timepieces.

12:26.045 --> 12:28.411
They're no different
than Kalton timepieces.

12:28.481 --> 12:31.939
Are you sure?
What do these numbers stand for?

12:32.017 --> 12:34.884
Rotations, intervals, fractions.

12:34.954 --> 12:36.581
Same as any timepiece.

12:36.655 --> 12:37.986
14 kelodas.

12:38.057 --> 12:41.254
A fair price.

12:41.327 --> 12:43.158
l might stop back later.

12:43.229 --> 12:44.355
lf there's time.

12:46.999 --> 12:48.660
lf l understood correctly,

12:48.734 --> 12:51.635
this world is going to be
destroyed sometime tomorrow.

12:59.078 --> 13:00.978
First Officer's Log,
supplemental.

13:01.046 --> 13:03.913
There's been no sign of Captain
Janeway or Lieutenant Paris

13:03.983 --> 13:06.508
since they were lost
in a subspace fracture.

13:06.585 --> 13:08.678
This is one of the subspace
fractures we've located

13:08.754 --> 13:10.722
with a magneton
scan of the surface.

13:10.790 --> 13:12.519
This is the time
of the explosion

13:12.591 --> 13:13.888
where the fracture opens.

13:13.959 --> 13:15.927
The, as the shock waves
dissipate,

13:15.995 --> 13:17.826
the fracture grows more narrow.

13:17.897 --> 13:20.388
We believe that the Captain
and Lieutenant Paris

13:20.466 --> 13:21.933
are trapped at the narrow end.

13:22.001 --> 13:24.094
Shock waves from most explosions
dissipate

13:24.170 --> 13:27.037
into the future, but we're
speculating-- based in part

13:27.206 --> 13:28.673
on what Paris told us he saw--

13:28.741 --> 13:31.107
that these dissipate
into the past.

13:31.177 --> 13:32.109
That's consistent

13:32.178 --> 13:33.907
with the subspace damage
we've observed.

13:33.979 --> 13:35.571
Why haven't they
been able to return

13:35.648 --> 13:37.309
as Mr. Paris did the first time?

13:37.383 --> 13:40.511
He wasn't all the way
inside a fracture.

13:40.586 --> 13:42.247
Remember? We still saw Paris
standing there

13:42.321 --> 13:43.982
even when he could see
the other side.

13:44.056 --> 13:46.650
So it's possible the Captain
and Paris are existing

13:46.725 --> 13:49.125
only hours and minutes
before the explosion occurs.

13:49.195 --> 13:51.527
There's no way for us to measure

13:51.597 --> 13:54.395
exactly how far back
these fractures go.

13:54.466 --> 13:56.161
How do we find them?

13:56.235 --> 13:58.100
lf l know Captain Janeway,

13:58.170 --> 14:00.934
she would activate
a subspace beacon to assist us.

14:01.006 --> 14:02.337
We're counting on it.

14:02.408 --> 14:03.841
First, we have to find
a fracture

14:03.909 --> 14:05.342
in a location where they've been

14:05.411 --> 14:07.572
then we have to microscan
the fracture

14:07.646 --> 14:09.876
to try to pick up the signal
from their subspace beacon.

14:09.949 --> 14:12.884
Once we've identified
where and when they are,

14:12.952 --> 14:15.614
then we have to widen
the fracture at that point.

14:15.688 --> 14:17.815
How do you suggest we do that?

14:19.525 --> 14:21.390
We're not sure yet.

14:29.468 --> 14:30.730
Hmm.

14:34.139 --> 14:35.663
Mm-hmm.

14:35.741 --> 14:37.208
-What?
-Hmm?

14:37.276 --> 14:38.436
ls something wrong?

14:38.510 --> 14:39.534
Yes, terribly wrong.

14:39.612 --> 14:42.775
Your brain is... not on file.

14:42.848 --> 14:44.975
Either your government
failed to transmit

14:45.050 --> 14:47.746
the standard 15-501
Crew Personnel Report

14:47.820 --> 14:50.755
or somebody at Starfleet Medical
really fouled up.

14:50.823 --> 14:52.984
l'm not a member
of the Starfleet crew.

14:53.058 --> 14:55.219
We came aboard
at mid-expedition.

14:55.294 --> 14:56.261
And no one asked you

14:56.328 --> 14:58.455
for your medical histories
when you arrived?

14:59.832 --> 15:03.461
Of course not-- that would be
the ship's doctor's job.

15:03.569 --> 15:05.127
My job.

15:05.170 --> 15:08.697
lf anyone had bothered
to tell me about new passengers,

15:08.774 --> 15:10.298
but l seem to be
the last to know

15:10.376 --> 15:12.241
just about everything
around here.

15:12.311 --> 15:14.404
So. Tell me--

15:14.480 --> 15:17.677
just how many other
new arrivals are there?

15:17.750 --> 15:18.808
Just us.

15:18.884 --> 15:20.408
And the crew from another ship
that was destroyed.

15:20.486 --> 15:22.852
Another... crew?

15:22.922 --> 15:25.015
That's nice.

15:25.090 --> 15:28.526
This is the emergency
medical holographic system

15:28.594 --> 15:30.061
to Captain Janeway.

15:30.129 --> 15:31.221
She's not on board.

15:31.297 --> 15:33.288
She's missing
on the surface of a planet.

15:34.333 --> 15:35.459
Missing?

15:35.534 --> 15:38.662
The Captain is missing?

15:41.073 --> 15:44.338
lt seems l've found myself
on the voyage of the damned.

15:44.410 --> 15:46.901
Very well.

15:46.979 --> 15:48.913
Please advise
the highest-ranking officer

15:48.981 --> 15:51.108
who is not missing

15:51.183 --> 15:54.414
to see me
at his earliest convenience.

15:54.486 --> 15:55.646
You may shut off my program now.

15:55.721 --> 15:58.815
But you haven't told us anything
about her condition.

15:58.891 --> 16:01.382
She's the healthiest member
of her species l've ever seen...

16:01.460 --> 16:04.588
the only member of her species
l've ever seen.

16:04.663 --> 16:07.723
You have a lovely brain.

16:07.800 --> 16:10.325
lt will make a fine
addition to our files.

16:11.370 --> 16:12.496
l wouldn't worry.

16:12.571 --> 16:14.004
lf your species has a history

16:14.073 --> 16:15.665
of extraordinary
mental abilities,

16:15.741 --> 16:18.335
this may simply be your way
of flexing those muscles

16:18.410 --> 16:19.741
for the first time.

16:19.812 --> 16:22.246
Living in space requires
the body to make

16:22.314 --> 16:23.645
a variety of biological
adjustments.

16:23.716 --> 16:26.913
This could be a side effect
of that process.

16:26.986 --> 16:28.317
Go home.

16:28.387 --> 16:32.255
Get a good night's sleep...
and drink plenty of fluids.

16:32.324 --> 16:33.621
Fluids?

16:33.692 --> 16:35.853
Everybody should drink
plenty of fluids.

16:35.928 --> 16:37.862
Don't leave
without turning me off.

16:37.930 --> 16:39.727
Computer, end program.

16:39.798 --> 16:40.890
And call me in the morning.

16:47.973 --> 16:49.133
We can assume that Voyager

16:49.208 --> 16:50.937
will be looking for a way
to reach us.

16:51.010 --> 16:53.774
l'll set my combadge
to emit a subspace beacon.

16:53.846 --> 16:55.438
lf they get close,
maybe they'll pick it up.

16:56.548 --> 16:58.072
l know.

16:58.150 --> 16:59.276
Maybe there's some way...

16:59.351 --> 17:00.978
Don't even think about it, Tom.

17:01.086 --> 17:02.747
The Prime Directive is clear.

17:02.788 --> 17:03.948
We cannot allow our presence

17:04.022 --> 17:06.013
to alter this planet's
natural course of events.

17:06.090 --> 17:08.388
Even if the natural course
of events is annihilation?

17:08.460 --> 17:09.483
Yeah.

17:09.560 --> 17:12.189
My father used
to talk at length to us

17:12.263 --> 17:13.195
about the Prime Directive,

17:13.265 --> 17:14.857
once a year--
like a holiday sermon.

17:14.933 --> 17:16.525
He considered it
the guiding principle

17:16.602 --> 17:17.864
of space exploration.

17:17.970 --> 17:18.867
To be honest,

17:18.971 --> 17:22.098
l tuned out most of his sermons
years ago.

17:22.174 --> 17:24.642
Well, tune back into this one
because l agree with him.

17:24.710 --> 17:26.644
You have no idea
what the consequences might be

17:26.712 --> 17:28.111
once you involve yourself.

17:28.180 --> 17:31.308
The consequences would have to
be better than mass destruction.

17:31.383 --> 17:33.442
You're not to warn these people.

17:33.519 --> 17:34.952
That's an order.

17:38.257 --> 17:39.485
Oh, God. Come on.

17:44.329 --> 17:45.853
l know you're lying.

17:45.931 --> 17:48.126
Young man, we're here
on a business trip

17:48.200 --> 17:49.929
and we have a lot of work to do.

17:50.002 --> 17:51.060
The Officer told me

17:51.136 --> 17:53.468
you came here
on the Continental Transport.

17:53.539 --> 17:55.803
That's right.
We're from Kalto province.

17:55.874 --> 17:58.399
Yeah? Well, l just talked
to the transport attendant.

17:58.477 --> 18:01.139
He told me four people
came today from Kalto.

18:01.213 --> 18:03.374
Two of them were
a lot older than you

18:03.449 --> 18:05.314
and they had a child with them.

18:05.384 --> 18:06.783
Well, the attendant was wrong.

18:06.852 --> 18:08.251
That was us.

18:08.320 --> 18:10.083
So, where's the child?

18:10.155 --> 18:11.986
We ate him.

18:12.057 --> 18:14.787
Because we are demons
and we eat children.

18:14.860 --> 18:17.021
And l haven't had my supper yet.

18:23.435 --> 18:26.268
Sorry, l just figured
it was the quickest way.

18:26.338 --> 18:28.169
Let's concentrate
on getting out of here.

18:35.848 --> 18:39.011
The same subspace fractures
that brought us here

18:39.084 --> 18:40.551
might still be around.

18:40.619 --> 18:44.419
lf they were caused
by a polaric explosion

18:44.490 --> 18:47.823
is there any way we could use
polaric energy to get us back?

18:51.497 --> 18:54.557
lf we had access to
a polaric ion generator,

18:54.633 --> 18:57.329
we could modify a tricorder
to emit a polaric field.

18:57.402 --> 18:59.802
At the very least, it might
help us scan for a fracture.

19:00.973 --> 19:03.203
l wonder where these
conduits get their power.

19:10.182 --> 19:12.343
This is a lawful demonstration.

19:12.417 --> 19:14.476
We have a right to be here!

19:17.389 --> 19:19.653
Under normal circumstances,

19:19.725 --> 19:21.625
l'd say we should
come back tomorrow.

19:52.691 --> 19:55.057
This device uses
the same polaric energy

19:55.127 --> 19:56.424
that destroyed the planet.

19:56.495 --> 19:59.259
At intense levels,
it can open a subspace fracture.

19:59.331 --> 20:01.697
Wide enough for the Captain
and Paris to get through?

20:01.767 --> 20:03.200
lf we can locate them,

20:03.268 --> 20:05.065
this is capable
of bringing them back.

20:05.137 --> 20:06.570
The logical place
to begin would be

20:06.638 --> 20:08.196
at the same location
they disappeared.

20:10.175 --> 20:12.700
The only problem is,
at the necessary intensity,

20:12.778 --> 20:14.712
the polaric generator
will burn itself out

20:14.780 --> 20:16.475
after 30 seconds at best.

20:16.548 --> 20:18.846
Can't we reinitialize the
generator and try again?

20:18.917 --> 20:20.646
Not at the same location.

20:20.719 --> 20:23.210
Once we make an attempt
at any given location,

20:23.288 --> 20:24.687
the damage to subspace

20:24.756 --> 20:26.383
will make a second attempt
impossible.

20:26.458 --> 20:29.222
How do we prevent one of us from
getting trapped in a fracture?

20:29.294 --> 20:32.525
We've modified our tricorders
to detect the fractures

20:32.598 --> 20:34.862
and all of us will be
wearing one of these.

20:34.933 --> 20:36.867
lt puts out
an anti-polaric field.

20:36.935 --> 20:38.562
lt should repel the fractures

20:38.637 --> 20:40.229
when they get
within three meters.

20:40.305 --> 20:41.670
Nice work.

20:42.941 --> 20:44.306
Ah, Commander.

20:46.645 --> 20:49.136
Will you be going back
to the planet's surface?

20:49.214 --> 20:50.579
We're getting ready
to leave right now.

20:50.649 --> 20:51.911
l have to go with you.

20:51.984 --> 20:54.782
There's nothing down there
you want to see, Kes.

20:54.853 --> 20:56.150
That's what l told her.

20:56.221 --> 20:58.451
l've already seen it.
l have to go.

21:10.269 --> 21:12.601
We're sorry
to involve you in this.

21:12.671 --> 21:14.639
Pe'Nar Makull.

21:14.706 --> 21:16.640
My colleague, Ny Terla.

21:16.708 --> 21:18.573
Apparently, you just
happened to be

21:18.644 --> 21:20.874
at the wrong place
at the wrong time.

21:20.946 --> 21:23.107
l was just thinking
the very same thing.

21:23.181 --> 21:25.149
What were you doing there?

21:25.217 --> 21:26.809
We're from Kalto province.

21:26.885 --> 21:30.343
We were hoping to tour
your power facility...

21:30.522 --> 21:31.420
compare it to our own.

21:31.490 --> 21:33.981
l've never seen a Kalton
with your color hair.

21:34.092 --> 21:37.152
Well, now you have.

21:37.229 --> 21:39.390
My friend thinks you were sent

21:39.464 --> 21:41.091
by the government
to infiltrate us.

21:41.166 --> 21:42.895
lnfiltrate?

21:42.968 --> 21:45.232
You were there
when she got this.

21:45.304 --> 21:48.000
Perhaps you were told
to put on a good show for us.

21:48.073 --> 21:50.667
We don't even know why someone
would want to infiltrate you.

21:52.077 --> 21:53.908
That's hard to believe.

21:53.979 --> 21:57.039
Even in Kalto, there are
protests against polaric energy.

21:57.149 --> 21:58.616
We're not spies.

21:58.684 --> 22:01.346
When was the last time
you were in a power plant?

22:01.420 --> 22:02.910
Not since we left home.

22:02.988 --> 22:04.853
You weren't
in that plant yesterday?

22:04.923 --> 22:08.757
We were just getting there
when we stumbled into you.

22:09.828 --> 22:12.058
We know you're not
telling the truth.

22:12.130 --> 22:15.497
We have safety monitors
to measure polaric energy.

22:15.567 --> 22:17.660
When you were brought here,

22:17.736 --> 22:20.933
they registered five times
the normal readings.

22:22.841 --> 22:24.138
To register levels this high,

22:24.209 --> 22:27.144
you were either inside
that plant yesterday

22:27.212 --> 22:28.577
or...

22:28.647 --> 22:30.638
at the site
of a polaric disaster

22:30.716 --> 22:33.241
worse than any in the history
of this planet.

22:57.943 --> 23:00.070
What is it?

23:00.145 --> 23:04.445
lt's as though l can sense
the people who were here.

23:04.516 --> 23:07.007
l know.

23:07.085 --> 23:09.610
lt's like walking
through a graveyard.

23:09.688 --> 23:11.053
No.

23:11.123 --> 23:13.284
lt's more than that.

23:13.358 --> 23:17.226
l almost feel...

23:17.295 --> 23:20.822
as if l could touch
the people who were here.

23:28.640 --> 23:30.540
What have you found?

23:30.609 --> 23:32.770
The scanners are not showing
any subspace fractures

23:32.844 --> 23:34.402
in the area now.

23:34.479 --> 23:36.504
That probably indicates
the subspace damage

23:36.581 --> 23:37.980
is beginning to dissipate.

23:38.083 --> 23:40.278
lf that's true,
it's going to be harder

23:40.352 --> 23:42.582
to locate Tom and the Captain.

23:42.654 --> 23:44.315
Commander, l'm picking up
a signal from a combadge.

23:44.389 --> 23:45.981
The subspace beacon?

23:46.057 --> 23:48.321
No, it's not on subspace.

23:48.393 --> 23:50.725
lt's here... now.

23:52.197 --> 23:53.494
Kim to Janeway.

23:54.833 --> 23:55.993
Kim to Paris.

23:56.067 --> 23:58.729
Can we locate
the source of the signal?

23:58.804 --> 24:00.271
Yes, sir.

24:00.372 --> 24:01.862
This way.

24:05.811 --> 24:07.244
What's your name?

24:07.312 --> 24:08.438
Janeway.

24:08.513 --> 24:09.741
Unusual name.

24:09.815 --> 24:11.305
Not where l'm from.

24:11.383 --> 24:13.681
What part of Kalto province
was that again?

24:13.752 --> 24:15.379
l don't see any point in this.

24:15.454 --> 24:17.922
There is a point,
a very important one.

24:18.023 --> 24:19.752
lt has to do with our schedule

24:19.825 --> 24:22.350
and whether we
can keep it or not.

24:23.428 --> 24:24.395
Can we?

24:24.463 --> 24:26.556
l don't know.

24:27.966 --> 24:29.661
Do they know our plan?

24:29.734 --> 24:31.827
l have no idea.

24:31.903 --> 24:33.131
Let me go!

24:33.205 --> 24:36.868
Look what l caught
sneaking around outside.

24:50.088 --> 24:51.783
l'm still not showing
any life signs.

25:02.400 --> 25:04.300
The boy has nothing
to do with any of this.

25:04.369 --> 25:05.631
ls he yours?

25:05.704 --> 25:07.831
No. He's just somebody
we met here.

25:07.906 --> 25:08.873
Don't trust them.

25:08.940 --> 25:10.134
They aren't
who they say they are.

25:10.208 --> 25:11.675
Really?

25:11.743 --> 25:13.404
Thanks, kid.

25:13.478 --> 25:15.912
Look, this is all
a misunderstanding.

25:16.014 --> 25:17.504
They lied about coming here

25:17.582 --> 25:18.913
on the
Continental Transport.

25:18.984 --> 25:21.179
l talked
to the attendant myself.

25:21.253 --> 25:22.220
Let me go...

25:22.287 --> 25:23.686
What do we do with him?

25:23.755 --> 25:25.052
We can't let him go.

25:26.725 --> 25:29.853
Just put him over there
with the other.

25:33.565 --> 25:35.965
Now stay quiet.

25:52.584 --> 25:53.983
The combadge is designed
to self-activate

25:54.085 --> 25:55.985
when the casing is destroyed.

25:56.054 --> 25:58.682
to help searchers
locate victims.

26:02.127 --> 26:03.094
l guess it means

26:03.161 --> 26:05.061
they were caught
in the explosion.

26:05.130 --> 26:08.566
lt only means their combadges
were caught in the explosion.

26:08.633 --> 26:11.101
Further speculation
serves no purpose.

26:11.169 --> 26:13.763
l suggest we search
for other tangible evidence.

26:22.447 --> 26:25.007
None of us have seen devices
like these before.

26:25.083 --> 26:27.551
Terla believes
they're spy equipment.

26:28.820 --> 26:30.913
They're for surveying property.

26:31.022 --> 26:33.081
l've been thinking
of buying land here.

26:33.158 --> 26:34.455
l need to survey it.

26:34.526 --> 26:36.494
l'd be curious
to know how they work.

26:36.561 --> 26:38.529
Would you show me?

26:43.001 --> 26:45.697
But then one of them
might be a weapon.

26:45.770 --> 26:47.260
And l wouldn't want
you to show me

26:47.339 --> 26:48.465
how that works, would l?

26:54.980 --> 26:56.675
Hey, kid.

26:56.748 --> 26:58.272
You were right about one thing.

26:58.350 --> 27:00.716
l was lying.
l don't eat children.

27:00.785 --> 27:02.776
You don't scare me.

27:02.854 --> 27:04.845
My father works
for the Media Bureau.

27:04.923 --> 27:06.857
And when l tell him
all about this, he'll...

27:06.925 --> 27:08.790
What is he,
some kind of journalist?

27:08.860 --> 27:11.260
Yes, and so am l.

27:11.329 --> 27:13.661
ls that right?

27:13.732 --> 27:16.030
l report for my school journal.

27:16.101 --> 27:18.865
That's right where everyone's
going to find out about you

27:19.004 --> 27:21.564
when l write about this
in next week's edition.

27:21.640 --> 27:23.005
What's your name?

27:23.074 --> 27:26.771
-Latika.
-Latika.

27:30.849 --> 27:31.907
l'm sorry.

27:32.017 --> 27:34.212
For what?

27:38.957 --> 27:39.924
l just am.

27:39.991 --> 27:41.788
l realize how this
must appear to you,

27:41.860 --> 27:43.225
but l'm just a patriot.

27:43.294 --> 27:44.386
A patriot?

27:44.462 --> 27:47.192
l sincerely believe
polaric energy

27:47.265 --> 27:49.927
has the potential
to destroy this entire world.

27:50.001 --> 27:52.834
And l take it, very few people
here agree with you?

27:52.904 --> 27:56.806
We have more support
since the accident at Markov.

27:56.875 --> 27:59.207
We know the companies
are afraid of us.

27:59.277 --> 28:02.337
We know they've increased
security at all their plants,

28:02.447 --> 28:04.915
but it will not be
enough to stop us.

28:09.154 --> 28:11.179
We can't wait another week.

28:11.256 --> 28:13.019
We have to move up
the schedule.

28:13.091 --> 28:15.457
We know they're not telling us
the truth.

28:15.527 --> 28:18.189
We have to assume
the government sent them.

28:18.263 --> 28:21.289
Tell everyone
we begin at 0400 tomorrow.

28:21.366 --> 28:23.732
Wait a minute.

28:24.769 --> 28:26.464
Captain...?

28:28.873 --> 28:30.238
Kes...

28:34.979 --> 28:37.243
Do you have something
to tell me, Janeway--

28:37.315 --> 28:38.612
if that's your real name?

28:42.020 --> 28:44.284
lt is my real name.

28:44.355 --> 28:46.255
Captain Kathryn Janeway

28:46.324 --> 28:48.758
of the Federation
Starship Voyager.

28:54.499 --> 28:56.660
l can feel their presence.

28:56.735 --> 28:58.327
Please elaborate.

28:58.403 --> 28:59.927
How can you feel their presence?

29:00.004 --> 29:02.495
l don't know.

29:02.540 --> 29:04.508
l just can.

29:11.483 --> 29:13.417
They've been in this room.

29:13.485 --> 29:15.112
l know it.

29:15.186 --> 29:18.417
ls there a subspace fracture
anywhere in here?

29:18.490 --> 29:19.582
Affirmative.

29:19.657 --> 29:21.124
Set up the equipment.

29:26.030 --> 29:28.464
You wanted the truth.
All right.

29:28.533 --> 29:30.524
Here's the truth.

29:30.602 --> 29:33.036
We're from the future--

29:33.104 --> 29:36.267
exactly one day in the future.

29:36.341 --> 29:38.707
You mean l was right?

29:38.777 --> 29:41.507
We weren't allowed to tell.

29:41.579 --> 29:43.843
At least, l thought we weren't.

29:48.953 --> 29:50.818
ln a few hours from now,

29:50.889 --> 29:54.052
there will be a serious accident
on this world.

29:54.125 --> 29:57.094
lt will be caused
by a polaric detonation.

29:57.162 --> 29:59.289
We came here
in an interstellar ship

29:59.364 --> 30:01.730
to investigate that explosion.

30:01.800 --> 30:02.858
When we arrived,

30:02.934 --> 30:06.335
we were exposed
to the polaric radiation.

30:06.404 --> 30:11.671
Showing a subspace fracture.
Coordinates: 141 by 21 by 14.

30:11.743 --> 30:13.643
Five percent drift.
Range: four meters.

30:13.711 --> 30:14.700
Got it.

30:14.779 --> 30:15.803
lnitiating generator.

30:15.880 --> 30:18.371
lnitiating microscan
of the subspace fracture.

30:19.617 --> 30:22.381
lt's very likely that whatever
you're planning to do

30:22.453 --> 30:24.978
could be responsible
for this tragedy.

30:25.089 --> 30:28.490
And somehow, you were able
to come back here to warn us?

30:28.560 --> 30:32.360
The explosion had an aftereffect
that no one expected.

30:32.430 --> 30:35.331
lt created fractures in time.

30:35.400 --> 30:39.097
We fell through
one of those fractures.

30:40.772 --> 30:43.935
lnterstellar ships,
fractures in time--

30:44.008 --> 30:47.375
do you honestly expect
us to believe all this?

30:50.348 --> 30:51.679
l found them.

30:51.749 --> 30:54.343
Scanners are picking up
a subspace beacon.

30:54.419 --> 30:57.718
Adjusting penetration
coordinates to match.

30:57.789 --> 31:00.053
l'll try to open up
the other end.

31:03.328 --> 31:04.852
Chakotay to Janeway.

31:04.929 --> 31:06.624
Captain, can you read us?

31:07.966 --> 31:09.160
Eavesdropping devices.

31:09.234 --> 31:10.166
No,

31:10.235 --> 31:12.601
but they are for communication.

31:12.670 --> 31:14.604
My crew is trying
to contact me.

31:14.672 --> 31:16.606
From the future, of course.

31:19.577 --> 31:21.568
Get the particle injector.

31:27.919 --> 31:30.217
Bring them with us--
the boy, too.

31:30.288 --> 31:31.448
l have an idea
how they can help.

31:41.266 --> 31:43.131
Chakotay to Janeway.

31:43.201 --> 31:44.668
Can you read me?

31:44.736 --> 31:45.964
Please respond.

31:53.544 --> 31:55.535
l don't get it, Captain.

31:55.613 --> 31:57.012
This morning
you were giving orders

31:57.081 --> 31:59.140
about not interfering
because of the Prime Directive.

31:59.217 --> 32:00.479
Now you're telling them
everything.

32:00.585 --> 32:02.678
l told them the truth
when l realized

32:02.720 --> 32:04.654
we'd already violated
the Prime Directive

32:04.722 --> 32:06.212
in the worst possible manner.

32:06.291 --> 32:07.883
How did we do that?

32:07.959 --> 32:09.085
Just by being here.

32:09.160 --> 32:10.491
Because if we hadn't been here,

32:10.561 --> 32:13.029
it's very possible this world
would not have been destroyed.

32:13.097 --> 32:14.394
What?

32:14.465 --> 32:15.625
Think about it, Tom.

32:15.700 --> 32:18.225
Before we got involved,
these people were planning

32:18.303 --> 32:20.430
to commit some kind
of sabotage next week.

32:20.505 --> 32:23.269
We were the ones who forced
a change in their schedule.

32:23.341 --> 32:27.209
Because of us, they decided
to begin today at 400 rotations

32:27.278 --> 32:29.303
and we know the detonation
takes place today

32:29.380 --> 32:31.211
just after 401.

32:31.282 --> 32:35.412
401 :22:84.

32:35.486 --> 32:37.317
Wait a minute.

32:37.388 --> 32:40.380
You're saying we're responsible
for an explosion

32:40.458 --> 32:42.517
even though it occurred
before our ship arrived here?

32:42.593 --> 32:44.618
We've traveled back
to a point in time

32:44.696 --> 32:46.163
before the explosion.

32:46.230 --> 32:48.790
So, yes, we can be
responsible for it.

32:51.803 --> 32:56.763
Let's say we never came
and their plans didn't change.

32:56.841 --> 32:59.469
Wouldn't the accident simply
have occurred next week

32:59.544 --> 33:00.704
instead of today?

33:00.812 --> 33:02.939
Who knows what might have
happened between now and then.

33:03.014 --> 33:04.038
They could have been arrested

33:04.115 --> 33:05.639
before they got a chance
to carry it out.

33:05.717 --> 33:06.706
Conditions at the plant

33:06.784 --> 33:08.581
might not have been
the same next week.

33:08.653 --> 33:11.588
But it's become
our problem now, Tom,

33:11.656 --> 33:14.955
and we have got to find
a way to solve it.

33:21.499 --> 33:22.898
We're running out of time.

33:22.967 --> 33:24.559
The subspace fractures
are closing.

33:24.635 --> 33:26.466
We've lost over 70 percent
of them.

33:26.537 --> 33:28.903
At this point, we're suggesting
we concentrate our search

33:28.973 --> 33:30.133
at the flash point.

33:30.208 --> 33:33.234
May l ask what you expect
to accomplish by doing that?

33:33.311 --> 33:35.677
We figure the Captain and Paris
might have looked

33:35.747 --> 33:37.806
for the origin of the explosion
to try and prevent it.

33:37.882 --> 33:38.906
Unlikely.

33:38.983 --> 33:40.814
lt would be a highly
questionable decision

33:40.885 --> 33:42.318
in light of the Prime Directive.

33:42.387 --> 33:45.879
lf it were me, l would
have tried to get there.

33:45.957 --> 33:48.949
The issue is whether
Captain Janeway would go there,

33:49.027 --> 33:50.654
not you, Commander.

33:51.963 --> 33:53.988
You think you can locate
the flash point?

33:54.065 --> 33:55.657
We already have.

33:57.035 --> 33:58.161
Let's go.

34:02.407 --> 34:04.841
Your job is to get us
past the guards.

34:04.909 --> 34:06.433
We'll tell them
you're bringing us here

34:06.511 --> 34:08.502
to negotiate a settlement
of our dispute

34:08.579 --> 34:09.705
with the power company.

34:09.781 --> 34:13.512
l cannot and will not
do anything to help you.

34:13.583 --> 34:15.813
Think before you say no.

34:15.887 --> 34:17.445
Terla has a weapon
trained on the boy.

34:17.522 --> 34:19.614
lf shooting begins,
he'll be the first victim.

34:32.870 --> 34:34.268
ls there something
l can do for you?

34:34.338 --> 34:35.668
She's a government
representative

34:35.739 --> 34:36.706
on official business.

34:47.251 --> 34:48.911
l am a hostage.

34:48.985 --> 34:51.045
These men are here
to break into the plant.

35:15.646 --> 35:19.377
Their lives are
on your conscience, Janeway!

35:22.420 --> 35:23.910
You saved my life.

35:24.021 --> 35:26.819
Don't waste...

35:26.891 --> 35:29.018
time with me, Captain.

35:29.093 --> 35:31.391
Got to stop them.

35:31.462 --> 35:34.761
Will you stay with him
until help arrives?

35:34.832 --> 35:36.094
Sure he will.

35:36.167 --> 35:37.429
The kid and l...

35:38.469 --> 35:40.767
we're old friends now,
aren't we?

35:40.838 --> 35:41.827
Yeah.

35:43.374 --> 35:45.205
l'll be back for you.

35:49.981 --> 35:52.211
We'll be here.

36:38.829 --> 36:40.558
The polaric levels
are higher here

36:40.631 --> 36:42.292
than any place
we've been so far.

36:42.366 --> 36:44.357
This was undoubtedly
the flash point

36:44.435 --> 36:45.424
of the explosion.

36:45.503 --> 36:49.439
Whatever went wrong,
it started here.

36:49.507 --> 36:52.032
Do we have subspace fractures
to work with in here?

36:52.109 --> 36:53.076
Affirmative.

36:53.144 --> 36:54.873
They remain quite numerous
in this area.

36:54.946 --> 36:56.811
Set up the equipment.

36:56.881 --> 36:58.576
Aye, sir.

37:40.558 --> 37:42.856
l need the injector.

37:45.863 --> 37:48.525
Just hand that bag to me.

37:53.537 --> 37:56.301
41 by 310.

37:56.374 --> 37:57.705
Two percent drift.

37:57.775 --> 37:59.174
Range: six meters.

37:59.243 --> 38:00.471
Mark.

38:00.578 --> 38:01.510
l have it.

38:01.545 --> 38:03.172
lnitiating generator.

38:03.247 --> 38:05.681
Scanning
for the subspace beacon.

38:09.353 --> 38:11.253
lt doesn't look like
they were here.

38:11.322 --> 38:12.414
lt is highly unlikely

38:12.490 --> 38:14.651
that Captain Janeway
would come here to...

38:14.725 --> 38:17.717
No, the Captain did come.

38:17.795 --> 38:19.422
She was here.

38:21.198 --> 38:23.428
This is where she died.

38:25.736 --> 38:27.169
Everybody on this planet

38:27.238 --> 38:29.263
has less
than three minutes to live

38:29.340 --> 38:31.240
if you go through with this,
Makull.

38:31.309 --> 38:32.640
Don't!

38:33.844 --> 38:37.780
What exactly do you think
we are planning to do here?

38:37.848 --> 38:40.510
l assume you're going
to sabotage the plant

38:40.584 --> 38:42.916
probably by detonating
some kind of device.

38:43.020 --> 38:44.920
We're not stupid enough
to blow up anything here.

38:44.989 --> 38:48.720
That may be true,
but something will go wrong.

38:48.793 --> 38:50.522
Nothing is going to go wrong

38:50.594 --> 38:53.927
unless you fire that weapon
near a polaric conduit.

38:53.998 --> 38:57.593
For everyone's safety,
l suggest you put it down.

38:57.668 --> 39:00.466
Give me the bag.

39:08.446 --> 39:12.314
All right, then... we'll wait.

39:12.383 --> 39:14.351
lf Kes is right,
the Captain was here

39:14.418 --> 39:15.612
at the moment
the explosion occurred.

39:15.686 --> 39:18.416
ls there any way
to break through subspace

39:18.489 --> 39:20.389
a few minutes
before the detonation?

39:20.458 --> 39:21.857
lf the widest point
of the fracture

39:21.959 --> 39:23.517
represents the time
of the explosion,

39:23.594 --> 39:26.529
couldn't we open a hole
just before the widest point?

39:26.597 --> 39:28.758
There's no way we could pinpoint
the exact time

39:28.833 --> 39:32.166
we'd be penetrating, but we
could make an educated guess.

39:32.236 --> 39:35.228
l feel it is my duty to point
out there is absolutely

39:35.306 --> 39:37.399
no logical reason
to believe Kes is correct.

39:37.475 --> 39:42.242
However, since l have no
alternative course of action

39:42.313 --> 39:44.838
to recommend at this time,
l suggest we proceed.

39:44.915 --> 39:46.280
Commander?

39:52.556 --> 39:53.682
What time is it?

39:57.361 --> 40:00.888
401 rotations plus 21.

40:00.965 --> 40:05.265
We'll just wait until... 23.

40:05.336 --> 40:06.826
Twenty-three?

40:06.904 --> 40:09.395
What's the importance of 23?

40:11.842 --> 40:13.173
Oh.

40:15.513 --> 40:18.141
This is all about
the alleged time

40:18.215 --> 40:20.183
of our self-annihilation.

40:20.251 --> 40:23.186
All right.

40:23.254 --> 40:26.189
Let's just see
if we can all get through the...

40:28.492 --> 40:29.823
What's going on?

40:29.894 --> 40:32.920
They're cutting
through subspace.

40:34.965 --> 40:36.796
My God.

40:36.867 --> 40:41.304
lt's going to intersect
with the conduit wall.

40:41.372 --> 40:43.806
Our own rescue attempt.

40:43.874 --> 40:45.705
That's what sets it off.

40:50.815 --> 40:53.409
My weapon may be able
to seal that hole.

40:53.484 --> 40:55.418
lt's our only chance.

41:11.702 --> 41:13.897
l'm getting nadion particle
resistance from the other side.

41:13.971 --> 41:16.997
lncreasing generator
to maximum output.

41:25.015 --> 41:27.108
The generator's overloading.

41:27.184 --> 41:29.175
l don't understand.
lt's not working.

41:29.253 --> 41:31.585
We're not penetrating
the fracture.

41:53.744 --> 41:56.611
Harry, Harry, Harry,
Harry, Harry.

41:56.680 --> 41:58.341
You really think
she's going to wait for you?

41:58.415 --> 41:59.507
l hope so.

41:59.583 --> 42:01.073
Let her go.

42:01.185 --> 42:04.154
Let her have a husband
and kids and a good life,

42:04.188 --> 42:06.418
while you and l have
the Delaney sisters.

42:06.490 --> 42:09.687
l told you l need to run
a transtator diagnostic.

42:09.760 --> 42:11.625
You need to run
a self-diagnostic.

42:11.695 --> 42:13.492
Look, they come as a pair.

42:13.564 --> 42:15.464
lt's a double date or no date.

42:15.533 --> 42:18.297
Come on.

42:18.369 --> 42:20.428
l told them all about you.

42:20.504 --> 42:22.972
What did you tell them
about me?

42:23.040 --> 42:25.201
Uh, well, for one thing,

42:25.276 --> 42:27.801
how you broke
the single-pilot speed record

42:27.878 --> 42:28.936
at the Academy.

42:29.013 --> 42:30.605
Record?

42:30.681 --> 42:32.512
l never broke any record.

42:32.583 --> 42:34.915
And who are they going
to check it with?

42:34.985 --> 42:36.953
Chakotay to Captain Janeway.

42:43.394 --> 42:44.725
Yes, Commander.

42:44.795 --> 42:46.319
We've identified
an M-Class planet

42:46.397 --> 42:47.989
in the red dwarf system
we're approaching.

42:48.098 --> 42:50.259
Do you want to change
course to investigate?

42:52.236 --> 42:54.397
Are you familiar with
any intelligent life-forms

42:54.471 --> 42:55.665
in this system, Mr. Neelix?

42:55.739 --> 42:57.172
Familiar?

42:57.241 --> 43:00.438
Ah, not exactly ''familiar.''

43:00.611 --> 43:05.139
Considerably less
than ''familiar,'' actually.

43:09.954 --> 43:11.478
Kes...

43:11.555 --> 43:14.046
what are you doing here?

43:14.124 --> 43:15.352
l had to know.

43:15.426 --> 43:16.358
Know?

43:16.427 --> 43:18.190
Know what?

43:18.262 --> 43:21.925
The planet...
everyone was killed.

43:21.999 --> 43:24.194
There was this terrible
explosion.

43:24.268 --> 43:26.463
You, you had a bad dream.

43:26.537 --> 43:29.597
No. lt was more than a dream.

43:29.673 --> 43:33.370
Mr. Tuvok, any indications
of trouble

43:33.444 --> 43:34.604
on that M-Class planet?

43:34.678 --> 43:35.906
Negative, Captain.

43:35.980 --> 43:37.675
ls it populated?

43:37.748 --> 43:39.978
Sensors do show humanoid life.

43:40.084 --> 43:42.712
There is no satellite system

43:42.786 --> 43:44.981
and no indications
of spacecraft in the vicinity.

43:45.089 --> 43:47.580
lt appears to be
a pre-warp civilization.

43:50.194 --> 43:51.957
Which means as a policy,

43:52.029 --> 43:54.156
we don't involve ourselves
in their affairs.

43:54.231 --> 43:55.892
Of course.

43:55.966 --> 43:58.332
A most enlightened philosophy.

43:58.402 --> 43:59.562
Come on, Kes.

43:59.637 --> 44:01.605
l'm sorry.
Captain...

44:01.705 --> 44:03.900
ls it possible
to see this planet

44:03.941 --> 44:05.169
on the viewscreen?

44:10.748 --> 44:12.147
There it is.

44:18.055 --> 44:19.522
Thank you.

44:24.962 --> 44:26.327
Come on.

44:28.399 --> 44:29.366
Just...

44:29.433 --> 44:32.869
Enter the planet's
coordinates into the log

44:32.936 --> 44:34.927
and maintain present heading,
Commander.

44:35.005 --> 44:37.064
Warp 6.

44:37.141 --> 44:38.972
Aye, Captain.
