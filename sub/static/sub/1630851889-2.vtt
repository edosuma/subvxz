[exhales]

00:39.289 --> 00:40.499
[sighs]

00:42.960 --> 00:44.127
What time is it?

00:45.379 --> 00:47.256
You can sleep some more.

00:48.841 --> 00:50.425
Where's Doyoon?

00:56.181 --> 00:57.766
He's gone, Sewon.

00:58.934 --> 00:59.852
Huh?

01:01.979 --> 01:03.355
Can you look for him?

01:10.821 --> 01:13.240
[Jaeyi] There you are! [laughs]

01:26.420 --> 01:28.338
[laughs]

01:29.256 --> 01:30.340
Was that fun?

01:32.384 --> 01:33.886
Higher! Higher!

01:33.969 --> 01:36.013
-[cat meows]
-[parent gasps]

01:37.055 --> 01:38.307
Doyoon.

01:38.390 --> 01:41.351
Your little kitty looks upset
we're having fun without her.

01:41.435 --> 01:42.603
[Doyoon] Oh, Mika!

01:42.686 --> 01:44.771
-[Jaeyi chuckles]
-Mika!

01:45.355 --> 01:46.440
Mika!

02:19.723 --> 02:20.766
[sighs]

02:26.522 --> 02:28.607
Looks like Doyoon is going outside.

02:32.069 --> 02:32.903
Jaeyi.

02:33.487 --> 02:34.488
[item thumps]

02:35.364 --> 02:36.657
Doyoon is going out the gate.

02:40.994 --> 02:41.870
Doyoon!

02:46.458 --> 02:48.502
No, please. Stay here.

02:49.253 --> 02:51.213
Doyoon just left though...

02:51.296 --> 02:53.131
Can't you please just listen?

02:54.299 --> 02:55.551
-Jaeyi...
-Please!

02:56.260 --> 02:58.637
Why is it impossible
for you to just listen?

02:58.720 --> 03:01.348
Doyoon is out there all alone!

03:01.431 --> 03:03.767
And it's safer that way!

03:03.851 --> 03:07.271
The father away he is from you,
the better! You hear me?

03:08.355 --> 03:11.233
[breathes heavily, gasping]

03:17.364 --> 03:18.866

[Sewon] Jaeyi.

04:26.767 --> 04:29.061
[breathes heavily]

04:29.853 --> 04:32.689
What's the matter? Huh?

04:39.821 --> 04:41.573
[distorted] Sewon...

04:41.657 --> 04:43.825
Listen, I'm begging you.

04:43.909 --> 04:45.786
Go and find our Doyoon, please...

04:45.869 --> 04:49.289
[ticking]

04:58.090 --> 04:59.091
[ticking stops]

05:04.805 --> 05:06.682

05:43.594 --> 05:44.803
[syringe clatters]

05:50.184 --> 05:51.602
Brain sync attempt.

05:52.769 --> 05:56.607
LIA, 6.9 hertz.
Stimulation interval, 2.1 seconds.

05:58.400 --> 06:02.029
Brain sync was successful
for a brief moment.

06:02.112 --> 06:08.118
Sync aborted due to a seizure
in the subject's temporal lobe.

06:09.745 --> 06:11.955
The memories accessed were...

06:12.039 --> 06:13.790
[giggling]

06:13.874 --> 06:15.209
It's safer that way!

06:20.506 --> 06:22.925
They felt like dreams or fantasies.

06:24.218 --> 06:28.222
Perhaps they were hallucinations
reflecting Jaeyi's psyche.

06:30.390 --> 06:33.894
Most probably because
the brain waves of the living

06:33.977 --> 06:39.149
are much more difficult to control
and interpret than the dead's.

06:40.442 --> 06:45.697
Executing a brain sync
with the living is most unstable...

06:47.324 --> 06:48.742
...and dangerous.

06:49.785 --> 06:51.703
Until I can find a solution...

06:53.413 --> 06:55.249
No more attempts will be made.

07:05.509 --> 07:06.718
Don't you worry.

07:08.220 --> 07:11.056
I promise to find Doyoon another way.

-[ringing continues]
-[sighs]

07:57.561 --> 07:58.395
Yes?

07:58.979 --> 08:01.648
Hey, I was just worried
because you're not at work.

08:02.274 --> 08:04.151
-How are you feeling?
-I'm fine.

08:04.776 --> 08:06.236
I'm just staying home today.

08:06.320 --> 08:08.322
Okay... All right.

08:09.448 --> 08:11.408
Let me know immediately
if you feel weird or--

08:11.491 --> 08:12.701
I'll call you later.

08:16.496 --> 08:18.457
-[door lock beeps]
-[door opens]

08:18.540 --> 08:19.541
[sniffs]

08:20.209 --> 08:21.335
[door closes]

08:22.085 --> 08:23.086
[gasps] Oh...

08:24.796 --> 08:26.006
Oh, you're home?

08:27.799 --> 08:30.177
Hmm... Did something happen to Jaeyi?

08:30.260 --> 08:33.347
No, I just wanted to work from home today.
That's all.

08:33.429 --> 08:36.850
Oh, I see. I'll be downstairs then.

08:50.822 --> 08:52.074
[Sewon sighs]

08:56.537 --> 08:59.164
-[mouse clicks]
-[doorbell rings]

09:07.756 --> 09:09.591
You have some explaining to do.

09:10.425 --> 09:14.346
Why wouldn't you tell us
that your wife tried to commit suicide?

09:16.974 --> 09:19.726
Not sharing personal information
with you a crime?

09:19.810 --> 09:22.354
It is when you're clearly doing it
to avoid suspicion.

09:22.437 --> 09:24.606
Why would I purposefully
incriminate myself?

09:24.690 --> 09:27.150
[police officer]
Your wife attempted suicide.

09:27.234 --> 09:28.986
And a man she was close to was murdered.

09:29.069 --> 09:31.363
And her husband
is still trying to hide something.

09:34.741 --> 09:37.744
I have to say,
this reminds me of Occam's razor.

09:38.745 --> 09:42.749
The theory states that the easiest
explanation is the most likely.

09:43.792 --> 09:45.961
A husband knew his wife was cheating, so--

09:46.044 --> 09:48.714
So of course, I must have
killed my wife out of jealousy.

09:50.007 --> 09:51.675
And naturally, murdered her lover as well.

09:52.301 --> 09:54.803
I think you brought your wife home

09:54.887 --> 09:57.973
to finish the job you set out
to do in the first place.

09:58.640 --> 09:59.641
That's a good point.

10:01.310 --> 10:02.519
So see for yourself.

11:01.411 --> 11:02.996
If I wanted my wife dead...

11:04.498 --> 11:06.500
Then why would I bother doing this?

11:06.583 --> 11:09.670
I don't know why
you're keeping your wife like this, but...

11:11.338 --> 11:13.048
This doesn't mean
you're free of suspicion.

11:13.924 --> 11:17.427
You're still a suspect
for murdering Junki Lim.

11:18.554 --> 11:19.763
We'll be back.

11:40.701 --> 11:42.953
[distant footsteps]

12:06.560 --> 12:07.895
[cat meows]

12:09.188 --> 12:10.564
[child] Mika!

12:11.106 --> 12:12.065
Mika!

12:14.401 --> 12:16.028
Hey, kid! Come here!

12:19.489 --> 12:20.908
[man] Heejin!

12:22.534 --> 12:24.953
-[man] Heejin! Come here!
-[Sewon breathing heavily]

12:26.455 --> 12:28.665
[man] Heejin, come here, sweetie!

12:37.466 --> 12:40.177
[giggling]

12:43.722 --> 12:46.725
The brain sync with Jaeyi
wasn't a complete failure.

12:48.143 --> 12:50.062
Traces of her memory are clear.

12:51.396 --> 12:52.814
The little girl I saw

12:54.107 --> 12:55.651
came to our house with Junki Lim.

12:55.734 --> 12:57.694
1. LIM AND JAEYI WERE CLOSE.
2. LIM HAS BEEN TO MY HOUSE.

12:57.778 --> 12:58.904
Heejin?

12:58.987 --> 13:01.281
3. THE GIRL IS LIM'S DAUGHTER.
4. DOYOON IS ALIVE?!!

13:01.365 --> 13:03.867
I think Heejin is Junki Lim's daughter.

13:07.371 --> 13:09.998
I have to find this girl who saw Doyoon.

13:13.126 --> 13:14.545
[recorder clicks]

13:35.274 --> 13:37.693
Can't say I expected you to call.

13:37.776 --> 13:41.697
Why did Junki Lim
tell you to look into me?

13:43.073 --> 13:45.868
He was under the impression
that you killed your wife.

13:48.662 --> 13:52.207
By the way, did you kill my client too?

13:52.291 --> 13:55.878
I had absolutely no clue
who Junki Lim was until I met you.

13:55.961 --> 13:58.088
[scoffs] All right, relax...

13:59.965 --> 14:01.925
So then, tell me why I'm here.

14:05.804 --> 14:07.431
Jaeyi and that man...

14:08.932 --> 14:10.767
How did they meet exactly?

14:13.395 --> 14:15.731
The info I gave you earlier was for free.

14:15.814 --> 14:18.442
If you want more, you'll have to hire me.

14:20.277 --> 14:21.111
If I do,

14:22.404 --> 14:25.407
will you find out what was really
going on between those two?

14:26.450 --> 14:28.535
Come on... That's what I do.

14:29.203 --> 14:31.538
All right, fine. You're hired.

14:33.749 --> 14:36.210
They met at this special clinic

14:36.293 --> 14:39.588
for children with issues,
who have trouble communicating.

14:41.089 --> 14:42.716
Children's clinic?

14:44.092 --> 14:47.804
[high-pitched ringing]

14:50.557 --> 14:51.600
[grunts]

14:53.894 --> 14:54.978
[groans, gasps]

14:56.438 --> 14:57.523
[ringing fades]

14:57.606 --> 14:59.316
[Heejin] Daddy!

15:03.278 --> 15:05.280
Daddy!

15:05.364 --> 15:06.365
Heejin.

15:07.115 --> 15:09.493
Hey, say hello. This is Jaeyi and Doyoon.

15:09.576 --> 15:11.578
-Hello, nice to meet you.
-[Jaeyi] Hello there.

15:11.662 --> 15:12.871
[Junki laughs]

15:12.955 --> 15:15.040
[children chanting] You're gonna lose!

15:15.123 --> 15:20.045
Rock, paper, scissors, shoot!
Rock, paper, scissors, shoot!

15:28.428 --> 15:30.764
Doyoon, are you ready?

15:38.564 --> 15:41.400
[groans, breathes heavily]

15:49.950 --> 15:51.743
I told her not to take Doyoon there.

15:51.827 --> 15:53.036
[laughs]

15:53.954 --> 15:56.957
Not as obedient
as you thought she was, huh?

15:58.584 --> 16:00.002
Let's take a walk.

16:07.718 --> 16:09.011
Where is Heejin now?

16:11.430 --> 16:14.057
You don't know Lim,
but you know his kid's name?

16:16.768 --> 16:18.187
It's a long story.

16:20.355 --> 16:21.982
Do you know where she might be?

16:23.275 --> 16:24.276
No.

16:25.694 --> 16:29.323
I assume she's with a relative
now that her father's dead.

16:30.949 --> 16:32.784
What's so important about her?

16:33.911 --> 16:36.330
I think she knows something about my son.

16:38.123 --> 16:40.125
The one who died in that fire?

16:44.546 --> 16:46.757
Just how much do you know about me?

16:47.633 --> 16:49.384
And how do you know about that?

16:55.599 --> 16:57.643
It's my job to know things, all right?

16:59.353 --> 17:00.354
[scoffs]

17:01.313 --> 17:03.482
Let's go to Lim's house.

17:07.402 --> 17:11.406
Go straight,
turn right at the intersection,

17:11.490 --> 17:13.157
and keep going.

17:13.242 --> 17:15.243
You'll see a white wooden house.

17:16.203 --> 17:17.829
That's Lim's house.

17:22.376 --> 17:25.002
What exactly do you need
to find out about him?

17:28.214 --> 17:31.260
Was there anything strange
about your son's death?

17:32.553 --> 17:33.762
Or...

17:34.638 --> 17:36.849
Do you have regrets about anything?

17:37.724 --> 17:39.351
Something you wish you hadn't done?

17:39.434 --> 17:41.061
Regret is

17:42.396 --> 17:43.897
a non-productive emotion.

17:43.981 --> 17:45.065
[scoffs]

17:46.275 --> 17:49.111
Can any father-son relationship
not have regrets?

17:50.904 --> 17:53.907
I lost touch with my father
a very long time ago.

17:54.950 --> 17:56.493
[clicks tongue]

17:56.577 --> 17:59.496
Turns out the things we fought
about then really didn't matter.

17:59.580 --> 18:00.998
I don't want to hear it.

18:02.040 --> 18:04.459
I don't need to know
about your personal life.

18:06.420 --> 18:07.421
Yeah...

18:09.214 --> 18:11.133
We're gonna get along just fine.

19:04.811 --> 19:05.896
[lock beeps]

19:05.979 --> 19:08.273
[keypad beeping]

19:08.357 --> 19:09.483
[lock clicks]

19:13.862 --> 19:17.241
[investigator] What the hell?
How'd you know the code?

19:19.910 --> 19:21.495
[alarm chirps]

20:03.120 --> 20:04.329
[screams]

20:04.413 --> 20:05.831
[investigator] What's wrong?

20:07.207 --> 20:09.501
Hey! You all right?

20:11.295 --> 20:13.881
[grunting, breathes heavily]

20:23.432 --> 20:28.187
Abdomen, solar plexus,
and here at the neck.

20:28.270 --> 20:30.981
The fatal blow must have been to the neck.

20:32.232 --> 20:35.027
Sure looks that way, but take a look.

20:38.822 --> 20:41.450
This stab here is what killed him.

20:42.951 --> 20:47.664
It pierced through his liver, stomach,
and aorta into the lumbar vertebrae.

20:47.748 --> 20:50.167
He would've been instantly paralyzed.

20:51.293 --> 20:55.631
But they also stabbed the neck
then went for the chest too.

20:56.757 --> 20:58.634
Eliminating any chance of survival.

20:59.134 --> 21:00.135
What did they use?

21:00.886 --> 21:03.263
It's no ordinary weapon, that's for sure.

21:04.431 --> 21:05.432
22 centimeters.

21:06.099 --> 21:09.144
These knives are about
22 centimeters long.

21:09.228 --> 21:12.147
And the killer was an expert
at handling these knives.

21:14.233 --> 21:16.151
Three perfect strikes.

21:16.235 --> 21:17.945
Your killer is skillful.

21:18.028 --> 21:19.404
So a professional hit?

21:19.488 --> 21:22.157
Or maybe it was a doctor
with serious medical knowledge?

21:22.241 --> 21:24.243
Is your main suspect a doctor then?

21:25.827 --> 21:28.580
Well, then here's something
even more surprising.

21:29.540 --> 21:31.834
If this here is film noir,

21:31.917 --> 21:34.670
then this part is mystery.

21:35.379 --> 21:36.630
Take a look at this.

21:39.758 --> 21:40.843
You see this hole?

21:41.802 --> 21:42.928
Huh?

21:43.846 --> 21:47.015
This hole was made long after he died.

21:47.099 --> 21:48.350
What's bizarre here...

21:49.476 --> 21:51.895
...is that this was
an extremely delicate procedure.

21:52.521 --> 21:56.650
It was done with great care
on a person who was long dead.

22:00.195 --> 22:01.196
[scoffs]

22:03.532 --> 22:04.616
[sighs]

22:07.202 --> 22:09.204
So that about catches us up.

22:12.082 --> 22:13.500
So you're saying...

22:14.710 --> 22:19.423
Lim's memories are somehow
now inside your head?

22:20.382 --> 22:24.011
And Lim's daughter, Heejin,
told you your son's still alive?

22:25.137 --> 22:26.722
-Something like that.
-[sighs]

22:28.599 --> 22:29.766
Do you do drugs?

22:30.517 --> 22:31.518
[sighs]

22:34.563 --> 22:36.023
Forget that brain sync bullshit.

22:36.523 --> 22:38.859
They're more likely
to believe that you killed Lim,

22:38.942 --> 22:41.236
seeing as you knew the code to his house.

22:41.987 --> 22:43.655
I knew you wouldn't believe me.

22:43.739 --> 22:45.324
Listen, Dr. Koh.

22:45.866 --> 22:48.869
It doesn't matter
what I believe or don't here.

22:48.952 --> 22:50.954
If what you say is true, why are we here?

22:51.663 --> 22:53.457
If you have Lim and Jaeyi's memories,

22:53.540 --> 22:56.543
you should know how it all went down,
isn't that right?

22:57.669 --> 23:00.088
Memories can't be controlled like that.

23:01.006 --> 23:04.510
It's nothing like recalling the past
or trying to remember a phone number.

23:05.135 --> 23:08.055
All these different memories
are tangled up in my head now.

23:08.680 --> 23:11.016
I can't really tell them apart just yet.

23:11.099 --> 23:14.520
So you have the memories,
but you can't control them yet?

23:15.646 --> 23:17.731
-Right.
-I see.

23:19.149 --> 23:21.985
Okay, let's say that's true.

23:22.945 --> 23:25.656
What can help you recall
the info you need?

23:25.739 --> 23:27.366
I'm not sure. Not yet.

23:28.075 --> 23:29.284
[sighs]

23:29.826 --> 23:34.456
But I believe that certain places,
objects, and smells or feelings...

23:36.542 --> 23:38.752
All seem to intensify the memories.

23:39.336 --> 23:41.046
Like what just happened.

23:46.260 --> 23:48.387
How about we scan your brain then, Doc?

23:50.806 --> 23:52.015
[detective] Pause it.

23:52.933 --> 23:54.101
[sighs]

23:54.184 --> 23:56.770
This is just getting spooky now.

23:56.854 --> 23:59.857
This kind of behavior isn't bold.
It's insane.

23:59.940 --> 24:01.692
We met him that day.

24:01.775 --> 24:05.279
He denied ever knowing Lim,
but then came straight here?

24:06.071 --> 24:08.073
What a total psycho.

24:08.657 --> 24:10.659
This guy is seriously dangerous.

24:34.391 --> 24:36.768
This has got to be her room.

24:39.605 --> 24:40.814
What's this?

24:43.400 --> 24:45.402
Did that girl draw all this?

24:48.155 --> 24:50.240
She's an extremely rare case.

24:51.450 --> 24:54.161
Born a genius,
but has developmental issues.

25:35.285 --> 25:37.913
[high-pitched ringing]

25:48.090 --> 25:49.091
[cat meows]

25:50.342 --> 25:51.635
[cat meows]

25:53.011 --> 25:54.888
It's Mika. Doyoon's cat.

25:55.472 --> 25:56.473
Hmm.

25:57.224 --> 25:59.893
You have to take care of Mika from now on.

26:02.563 --> 26:03.397
Why?

26:07.317 --> 26:08.527
Well...

26:11.321 --> 26:14.700
Doyoon isn't with us. Not anymore.

26:16.076 --> 26:17.327
Where is he then?

26:18.745 --> 26:19.955
[sighs]

26:23.584 --> 26:25.752
He lives in heaven now.

26:28.338 --> 26:30.174
But Doyoon's not dead.

26:31.383 --> 26:34.511
I saw him this morning.

26:34.595 --> 26:36.013
-Huh?
-Heejin...

26:37.306 --> 26:38.807
Heejin, what did you say?

26:38.891 --> 26:39.808
Jaeyi.

26:39.892 --> 26:42.227
Heejin sometimes talks about things

26:42.311 --> 26:45.355
that she imagined or dreamed
as if they were real.

26:45.439 --> 26:48.066
She doesn't understand
the concept of death yet.

26:48.150 --> 26:48.984
[sighs]

26:49.693 --> 26:50.944
So, Heejin...

26:52.654 --> 26:54.781
Where did you see him? Tell me.

26:58.827 --> 27:00.120
Did you see something again?

27:03.540 --> 27:04.750
[cat meows]

27:06.835 --> 27:07.836
[cat meows]

27:09.254 --> 27:12.591
I want to put Mika in my treasure box.

27:12.674 --> 27:15.010
[Junki scoffs]
Ah, that's going to be tricky.

27:15.093 --> 27:18.347
Mika is a living, breathing creature.
Mika needs water and sunlight.

27:29.441 --> 27:31.610
[items clattering]

27:35.113 --> 27:36.782
[Sewon] "Grandma"?

MIJAN-MYEON 54-GIL 61914

27:39.326 --> 27:40.536
There's an address.

27:52.214 --> 27:53.632
[cashier] Good evening.

28:21.118 --> 28:23.161
[scanner beeps]

28:37.217 --> 28:39.344
[dogs barking in distance]

28:43.932 --> 28:46.101
[lock clicks, beeps]

29:21.136 --> 29:22.387
[Sewon] What are you doing?

29:24.806 --> 29:26.016
What is it?

29:27.226 --> 29:28.727
There's a dead cat.

29:29.520 --> 29:30.729
Mika?

29:40.489 --> 29:42.115
It's my son's cat.

29:42.699 --> 29:44.076
Looks like it got hit by a car.

29:44.159 --> 29:45.994
Rigor mortis hasn't set in yet.

29:46.703 --> 29:48.121
And her body's still warm.

29:53.669 --> 29:55.087
[investigator] What is it?

29:55.963 --> 29:57.381
Are you burying it?

29:59.508 --> 30:01.134
I'm going to brain sync with her.

30:01.677 --> 30:02.845
[investigator] What?

30:03.345 --> 30:04.888
You can't be serious.

30:04.972 --> 30:06.849
You want to do what with that dead cat?

30:07.474 --> 30:09.685
I think she might have seen the killer.

30:10.352 --> 30:14.189
Or more importantly, she could've
seen what happened to my son.

30:14.273 --> 30:17.234
I really think we're better off
checking out the grandma's house.

30:17.317 --> 30:18.151
No.

30:18.235 --> 30:19.862
I'm syncing with Mika.

30:20.612 --> 30:24.908
If we wait too long to synchronize,
her neurons will be too deteriorated.

30:41.925 --> 30:45.053

31:13.790 --> 31:15.209
Are you Heejin?

31:46.281 --> 31:48.617
[chiming]

31:50.702 --> 31:54.164
You should get out here.
They don't let outsiders in the lab.

31:56.041 --> 31:58.210
No point in wasting more time then.

31:58.710 --> 32:00.212
I'll go visit the grandmother.

32:00.295 --> 32:02.673
No, let me go.

32:04.174 --> 32:05.217
Don't you trust me?

32:05.801 --> 32:07.386
I have something important to ask her.

32:09.096 --> 32:11.515
Fine.
I'm not really sure I trust you either.

32:13.851 --> 32:17.354
I'll reach out to my informant
about Lim's autopsy, all right?

32:18.230 --> 32:20.983
-He might tell me something useful.
-Fine.

32:21.692 --> 32:24.278
Let's talk tomorrow, around...

32:27.114 --> 32:29.950
Wait, when did this piece of junk die?

32:32.202 --> 32:34.204
Anyway, I'll be in touch.

32:42.796 --> 32:43.797
[knocks]

32:48.385 --> 32:51.430
Are you really doing
a brain sync with that cat?

32:52.097 --> 32:53.098
Yes.

32:53.765 --> 32:55.392
I'm sure she saw something.

32:57.728 --> 33:02.107
You're most definitely off your rocker.
[laughs]

33:02.191 --> 33:03.775

35:30.088 --> 35:32.341
-[Jaeyi] Mika.
-[Doyoon] Mika!

35:33.008 --> 35:34.718
[Jaeyi] Good girl.

36:28.522 --> 36:29.898
Are you okay?

36:33.735 --> 36:36.321
-What time is it?
-About 7:30.

36:37.823 --> 36:40.033
[groans]

36:40.117 --> 36:43.328
-Sewon, what happened?
-[groans]

36:43.412 --> 36:44.872
Over there.

36:44.955 --> 36:46.874
-Mika, the cat...

36:48.417 --> 36:50.794
[groans, breathes heavily]

36:50.878 --> 36:52.588
Can you put her in the freezer...

36:53.589 --> 36:55.424
...and clean this place up for me?

36:56.508 --> 36:57.718
Wait a minute...

37:44.640 --> 37:47.601
Since feline visual fields are different,

37:47.684 --> 37:51.438
I saw strange
and indistinguishable phenomena

37:51.522 --> 37:53.232
and heard sharp noises.

37:53.899 --> 37:57.486
I think I saw someone
attacking Junki Lim, but...

37:59.071 --> 38:00.697
I couldn't identify him.

40:03.612 --> 40:05.489
Why? Are you a journalist?

40:05.572 --> 40:06.782
No, I'm not.

40:07.407 --> 40:10.035
I was just passing by
and stopped to admire the view.

40:10.118 --> 40:11.453
[resident] Oh.

40:11.954 --> 40:15.332
They say that
the old woman who lives here,

40:15.415 --> 40:18.836
her son and her granddaughter
from Seoul, all just vanished.

40:21.380 --> 40:24.716
Goodness, can you imagine
how shocked her husband must've been

40:24.800 --> 40:26.802
when he saw that the house was ransacked?

40:26.885 --> 40:28.887
[resident 1]
At least the cops came immediately.

40:28.971 --> 40:29.972
[resident 2] Yeah.

40:30.055 --> 40:32.057

They've been searching all night

40:32.140 --> 40:33.433

40:33.517 --> 40:35.477
-How can something like this happen?
-[crying]

40:35.561 --> 40:39.773
[resident 2] That family must be cursed.
Her son-in-law died a little while ago.

40:42.526 --> 40:44.862
Anyway, there isn't much
to see around here.

40:44.945 --> 40:47.739
But if you go down that way,
you'll see a creek and a temple.

40:48.532 --> 40:49.741
Thanks.

40:51.827 --> 40:53.287

Dr. Koh?

43:19.641 --> 43:20.851
I need a favor.

43:20.934 --> 43:22.978
Could you run a license plate for me?

43:24.062 --> 43:27.983
Dr. Koh, if you have something to say,
come into the station.

43:28.066 --> 43:32.821
I know that Lim's daughter, Heejin,
and her whole family have disappeared.

43:35.240 --> 43:36.241
How do you know that?

43:36.909 --> 43:39.036
I was just at her grandmother's house.

43:40.662 --> 43:42.122
If you agree to help me,

43:42.998 --> 43:45.375
then there's a chance
I might be able to find her.

43:45.959 --> 43:47.836
You have to run the license plate.

43:47.920 --> 43:49.421
I think I saw that same car.

43:50.088 --> 43:52.132
It was in front of the house
when Lim was killed.

43:52.216 --> 43:56.053

Please.

44:02.267 --> 44:03.477

44:08.357 --> 44:13.779
So what if Dr. Koh is also responsible
for Heejin's disappearance?

44:15.531 --> 44:17.366
It's quite possible.

44:18.867 --> 44:21.870
But why is he asking me for a favor then?

46:28.705 --> 46:29.915
LIEUTENANT JI UN CHOI

46:31.291 --> 46:32.376
Yes?

46:33.252 --> 46:34.962
This is Lieutenant Choi.

46:36.171 --> 46:38.757
We found the owner of the car
you were talking about.

46:41.468 --> 46:42.761
The name is Kangmu Lee.

46:44.680 --> 46:47.015
He's an ex-cop
turned private investigator.

46:47.641 --> 46:48.934
Do you know him?

46:50.811 --> 46:53.272
Are you saying that Lim's killer is...

46:54.189 --> 46:55.399
...Kangmu Lee?

46:56.692 --> 46:58.735
That's impossible.

46:59.444 --> 47:00.904
What are you talking about?

47:01.405 --> 47:05.993
Kangmu Lee has been dead
for four days now.

47:06.618 --> 47:08.871
He died before Lim was killed.

47:08.954 --> 47:11.582
That car was scrapped
the day we found him dead.

47:16.753 --> 47:17.754
Are you there?

47:18.714 --> 47:20.215
Dr. Koh?

47:26.471 --> 47:27.514
