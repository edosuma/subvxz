WEBVTT

00:06.760 --> 00:08.328
What the HELL is going on here?

00:11.367 --> 00:13.767
Well these guys were supposed to go on a three-hour tour,

00:13.795 --> 00:14.723
but now they're shipwrecked.

00:16.341 --> 00:20.409
And the sexual tension between Gilligan and the skipper is reaching a braking point.

00:22.441 --> 00:25.940
It's so stupid. Why don't they just kill the fat one for food?

00:27.345 --> 00:28.770
I'm not talking about Giligan.

00:31.189 --> 00:32.899
I'm talking about the new guy sitting in my chair.

00:35.081 --> 00:36.802
Fez, chairs are first come, first served.

00:37.420 --> 00:40.107
We decided that in the Great Chair Ne gotiation of '78.

00:41.705 --> 00:43.604
Although that doesn't apply to me

00:43.905 --> 00:46.509
due to the "If you sit in my chair, I'll kick you in the nad's" amandement.

00:48.843 --> 00:50.875
Here, you can have it. I don't mind.

00:52.363 --> 00:53.282
You'll live another day...

00:56.464 --> 00:57.920
Fez, why do you pick on Randy?

00:58.205 --> 01:00.889
Based on his hair and good looks, I think he is a really good person.

01:02.462 --> 01:04.521
I just don't like people that aren't from here, that's all.

01:07.359 --> 01:08.958
You know I was thinking we could get out of here anyway.

01:09.205 --> 01:10.719
Maybe go somewhere, have some fun?

01:11.355 --> 01:12.669
Why are you trying to ruin our Saturday?

01:13.819 --> 01:16.415
Come on, let's go down to Fatso Burger and get some burgers and fries.

01:16.984 --> 01:18.764
Teenagers love burgers and fries!

01:19.992 --> 01:21.179
Nah...no thanks...

01:21.622 --> 01:22.888
What if I said I'm buying?

01:24.000 --> 01:30.074

01:32.868 --> 01:35.120
Randy, on behalf of all of us, I just like to say:

01:36.177 --> 01:36.776
*BUUUURRPP*

01:39.307 --> 01:41.862
I can smell the oniony thanks all the way over here.

01:43.569 --> 01:44.309
Listen Randy.

01:45.367 --> 01:47.010
Just because I ate three hamburgers...

01:48.865 --> 01:49.863
doesn't mean I like you.

01:51.863 --> 01:52.569
It just means

01:53.650 --> 01:54.483
I have no self-control.

01:56.315 --> 01:59.004
Yeah. Look at that disgusting clown.

02:01.206 --> 02:02.604
It's totally freaking me out.

02:04.307 --> 02:05.446
You're scared of Fatso?

02:06.668 --> 02:08.270
But he's the friendly neighbourhood clown

02:08.270 --> 02:10.613
who gives grade D beef to all the boys and girls.

02:12.422 --> 02:14.591
Well I just don't like the way his eyes follow me around.

02:15.157 --> 02:16.777
It's the same reason I hate art.

02:19.663 --> 02:21.459
What have I told you kids? What have I told you?

02:22.799 --> 02:24.079
Don't pee on the bathroom key?

02:26.169 --> 02:28.623
One ketchup bottle per table. ONE ketchup per table .

02:29.560 --> 02:30.782
Why do you say everything twice?

02:31.018 --> 02:32.015
Shut up. Shut up!

02:34.535 --> 02:35.486
I hate that guy.

02:36.096 --> 02:37.339
He acts like he owns the place.

02:38.743 --> 02:40.046
He does own the place.

02:40.630 --> 02:41.405
Well he acts like it.

02:43.027 --> 02:46.133
Hey, he's just a small businessman trying to make end meet.

02:47.793 --> 02:48.591
Let's ruin him.

02:50.156 --> 02:52.634
I've got it! Let's throw a bunch of pickles at his window!

02:54.295 --> 02:56.855
Then, he'll become a prisoner of his own pickle-prison.

02:59.200 --> 02:59.583
Or...

03:00.026 --> 03:01.506
we could steal Fatso the Clown.

03:02.440 --> 03:04.976
Steal Fatso the Clown...allright man!

03:05.257 --> 03:06.467
Yay Randy!

03:06.904 --> 03:09.041
Noooo BOO Randy! Yay Fez!

03:13.262 --> 03:14.682
Pickle attack, let's do it!

03:19.520 --> 03:20.119
Where did it go?

03:28.059 --> 03:29.679
Okay, I have a better idea...

03:31.687 --> 03:32.838
let's steal that clown!

03:37.987 --> 03:45.071
Saison 8 Episode 7

03:48.980 --> 03:55.984
" Fun It "

04:00.001 --> 04:03.973
Synchro : malena d(^_^)b

04:13.244 --> 04:14.829
We're stealing a clown!

04:15.768 --> 04:17.962
GOD, being bad is SO exicting.

04:19.351 --> 04:20.420
My palms are sweaty.

04:20.721 --> 04:21.503
When I was with Eric,

04:21.504 --> 04:25.162
the only times my palms were sweaty was when I was holding his sweaty palms.

04:26.829 --> 04:29.329
Well I don't want anything to do with that red-nosed freak.

04:30.572 --> 04:31.769
Why are you so afraid of clowns?

04:32.309 --> 04:33.484
It was my 7th birthday party.

04:34.634 --> 04:36.746
This clown asked me if I wanted to smell his pretty flower.

04:38.642 --> 04:39.675
And when I did...

04:40.367 --> 04:42.119
it squirted water all over my face...

04:45.300 --> 04:46.907
and then he offered me his handkerchief....

04:47.982 --> 04:55.743
when I pulled it out of his pocket...it just kept coming...and coming...and coming...

04:55.964 --> 04:57.221
And that's why you hate clowns?

04:58.484 --> 05:00.832
No later I walked in on him making out with my Mom.

05:03.611 --> 05:04.280
BASTARD!

05:08.495 --> 05:12.030
Okay, wire cutters, cresent wrench and a bolt cutter.

05:12.398 --> 05:13.326
What about an axe?

05:16.011 --> 05:17.209
Do we need an axe?

05:18.450 --> 05:19.659
No...I think we're good...

05:21.122 --> 05:23.929
but if we decided to go on a killing rampage in a sleep-away camp...

05:24.919 --> 05:25.318
I'll call you.

05:28.980 --> 05:30.092
Okay smart guy.

05:30.236 --> 05:31.369
I thought of something you haven't.

05:31.803 --> 05:32.825
We need a getaway-car.

05:34.432 --> 05:36.099
See, your plan is unraveling.

05:38.612 --> 05:40.209
I thought we could take that station wagon right there.

05:41.367 --> 05:42.506
Damn. Your plan has re-ravelled.

05:44.368 --> 05:44.803
But wait...

05:45.354 --> 05:48.068
Red has the keys! Aha! Your plan is unraveling again.

05:49.465 --> 05:50.510
We don't need the keys!

05:50.863 --> 05:52.385
I'll hotwire that son of a bitch!

05:55.987 --> 05:58.911
What's the big deal? I'll just ask Red if I can borrow the car.

05:59.262 --> 06:02.502
Uh while your at it, why don't you ask Red if your ass can borrow his foot.

06:04.387 --> 06:05.783
Uhh... no.

06:06.006 --> 06:07.249
I think I'll just ask for the car.

06:08.440 --> 06:10.507
I'll ask Red. I have a lot of experience with him.

06:11.030 --> 06:12.920
He loves me because I used to have sex with his daughter.

06:18.931 --> 06:20.269
Okay Randy, watch and learn.

06:21.109 --> 06:23.575
Hey Red, reading the paper, that good old paper.

06:25.470 --> 06:25.940
Get out.

06:25.979 --> 06:26.813
Okay the plan is off.

06:29.377 --> 06:32.430
Uh. Hey Mr. Forman, I thought maybe you could lend us the Vista Cruiser.

06:32.845 --> 06:34.037
Well that's interesting Kitty.

06:34.338 --> 06:36.733
I don't see anything in here about hell freezing over.

06:39.306 --> 06:39.658
It's just...

06:40.139 --> 06:43.170
I wanted to build a wheelchair ramp for my grandmother and I wanted to buy some lumber.

06:47.757 --> 06:48.908
Come on Red!

06:49.644 --> 06:53.568
Just picture his poor old grandmother going down the stairs in a wheelchair.

06:53.580 --> 06:55.824
Bouncing all over the place!

06:56.789 --> 06:58.167
Ahaha.

06:59.238 --> 07:02.655
Oh, I don't mean to laugh. Red, she needs his help.

07:03.685 --> 07:04.671
Oh fine

07:05.472 --> 07:08.301
But fill up the tank, bring it back by tomorrow

07:09.006 --> 07:11.166
and do something with that hair. Jeez!

07:12.976 --> 07:14.960
A wheelchair ramp?! What a load of crap.

07:16.082 --> 07:18.900
Fez, my grandmother is in a wheelchair. She had polio.

07:20.325 --> 07:21.851
Well everything works out perfect for you...

07:28.337 --> 07:30.415
I can't believe I'm an accessory to crime!

07:31.548 --> 07:33.333
We could get caught! I could get arrested!

07:34.153 --> 07:36.361
I could go to a girl-prison this freakin' ROCKS.

07:38.825 --> 07:39.788
I remember my first crime.

07:40.639 --> 07:41.848
Grand theft tricycle.

07:45.702 --> 07:47.405
I did three days in the crib for that job.

07:49.576 --> 07:50.973
There is a car coming! Scatter!

07:52.216 --> 07:53.871
Oh no! I didn't scatter!

08:01.049 --> 08:02.329
What's cooking Fatso?

08:03.856 --> 08:05.053
Uhm...

08:05.969 --> 08:07.092
WELCOME TO FATSO BURGER!

08:09.161 --> 08:10.312
I'll have a uh...

08:10.857 --> 08:13.235
big Fatso combo with extra secret sauce.

08:13.923 --> 08:15.050
Would you like apple-pie with that?

08:16.585 --> 08:17.137
Sure!

08:18.521 --> 08:20.470
And the extra large soda for ten cents more?

08:22.792 --> 08:23.367
Okay.

08:24.543 --> 08:26.257
Oh, and onion rings are free with all that.

08:28.785 --> 08:29.583
I'll take 'm!

08:30.832 --> 08:31.736
So let me read that back:

08:34.876 --> 08:37.118
one big Fatso combo with extra sauce,

08:38.092 --> 08:40.804
an apple pie, extra large soda and one onion rings.

08:43.405 --> 08:44.039
You got it.

08:45.143 --> 08:45.988
Sorry. We're closed.

08:47.492 --> 08:49.500
What?! Then why did you take my order?!

08:50.045 --> 08:51.160
Thank you. Please drive away.

08:52.241 --> 08:53.386
But I'm hungry!

08:53.635 --> 08:54.560
Then go get a pizza!

08:55.553 --> 08:56.997
I had pizza for lunch!

08:57.807 --> 08:58.723
WELL WHO'S FAULT IS THAT?!

09:00.015 --> 09:01.342
GO TO HELL FATSO!

09:02.242 --> 09:03.604
SEE YOU THERE LARD-ASS!

09:11.763 --> 09:12.855
That was awesome!

09:13.915 --> 09:15.852
Bob has gotten into a fight with a ceramic clown!

09:18.239 --> 09:20.153
Believe it or not, it wasn't the first time.

09:22.019 --> 09:23.769
Okay Fatso, you're coming with us.

09:24.227 --> 09:26.227
And if you try to fight back, well,

09:26.886 --> 09:28.369
that'll scare the living crap out of us.

09:29.525 --> 09:30.442
Okay you guys,

09:30.903 --> 09:32.886
after this we should steal a car!

09:34.985 --> 09:35.985
NO! A kid!

09:43.823 --> 09:45.623
Donna...that kidnapping.

09:47.301 --> 09:49.384
Okay fine, a dog! Just something alive!

09:58.352 --> 09:59.924
Now don't drink too much Fatso,

10:00.171 --> 10:02.719
you've got to drive your 30 friends home later in your tiny car.

10:05.315 --> 10:05.923
You guys,

10:06.115 --> 10:09.582
stealing this clown was an immature act of revenge and vandalism.

10:11.089 --> 10:12.273
Oeh, let's draw boobs on him!

10:14.383 --> 10:16.141
So you guys WHAAAAAAAAAHAHAHAHAAAAAAAAAAAAA!

10:17.924 --> 10:19.641
WHAT THE HELL IS THAT DOING HERE?!

10:20.483 --> 10:22.233
We stole Fatso the Clown!

10:23.116 --> 10:23.927
And now we're gonna...

10:24.793 --> 10:25.160
uhm...

10:28.594 --> 10:30.128
what do we do with a stolen clown?

10:31.197 --> 10:33.413
THIS is what we do with a stolen clown.

10:35.222 --> 10:37.322
Actually, this is what we do without a stolen clown.

10:38.861 --> 10:40.518
It always comes back to this.

10:42.102 --> 10:46.868
Hohohohohohohoho. Thanks for bringing me here you guys!

10:48.013 --> 10:51.725
So Fatso, now that you're free, is there anything we can do for ya?

10:51.935 --> 10:53.274
Huhuh YEAH.

10:53.293 --> 10:58.671
Find me a really trashy clown-hooker with nice long legs and a pair of double D.

10:58.718 --> 10:59.375
*honks horn*

11:01.134 --> 11:02.584
I found this in the garage.

11:05.470 --> 11:07.087
Oh Randy, you think you are so funny...

11:10.148 --> 11:11.115
That was funny.

11:13.552 --> 11:15.769
Look at that freaky-ass clown.

11:16.648 --> 11:18.211
It's just staring at me...

11:20.126 --> 11:21.626
he doesn't even blink...

11:22.710 --> 11:23.993
It's because he likes you.

11:24.843 --> 11:25.760
He loves you.

11:26.855 --> 11:28.688
He wants to marry you and then.. KILL YOU!

11:28.689 --> 11:29.267
AAAARRGGHHH!

11:37.275 --> 11:39.492
You guys, something terrible happened.

11:40.291 --> 11:41.757
Fatso the Clown was stolen!

11:44.116 --> 11:44.883
What?

11:45.817 --> 11:47.650
But he was a Wisconsin landmark.

11:48.833 --> 11:51.716
He's been sitting on that bun since I was a little girl!

11:53.630 --> 11:54.680
I feel so guilty.

11:55.805 --> 11:57.188
I was the last one to talk to him.

12:00.736 --> 12:01.786
We had an awful fight.

12:04.457 --> 12:05.851
What are you crying about?

12:06.551 --> 12:08.172
It was a speaker with a face on it.

12:09.815 --> 12:11.615
Oh he was more then that!

12:12.273 --> 12:13.857
He was a part of our history.

12:14.023 --> 12:16.440
I got a lot of warm memories about that place too.

12:17.949 --> 12:19.799
I knocked up Midgy in the parking lot.

12:21.162 --> 12:22.479
Don't you remember Red?

12:22.962 --> 12:23.759
When we were dating,

12:23.760 --> 12:28.354
we used to go to Fatso Burger every friday night and just dream about our future.

12:29.040 --> 12:30.507
I thought we were just eating burgers.

12:32.772 --> 12:34.405
Women are always doing something else!

12:35.937 --> 12:36.537
That's true.

12:37.237 --> 12:39.191
Midgy was drinking a shake when I knocked her up.

12:46.683 --> 12:47.816
Rock, paper, scissors, shoot!

12:50.097 --> 12:51.364
Paper again Fatso?

12:52.421 --> 12:52.937
I win.

12:54.527 --> 12:55.311
Let me try.

12:57.236 --> 12:58.558
Rock, paper, scissors, shoot!

13:01.574 --> 13:03.281
Owaahh, we both did paper!

13:05.224 --> 13:06.404
Congratulations Fez.

13:06.721 --> 13:08.106
You tied a ceramic clown.

13:11.060 --> 13:12.493
You guys, I got to turn on the TV.

13:12.764 --> 13:15.648
Ugh Donna, no-one is in the mood for one of your muscle-building shows.

13:18.081 --> 13:18.781
No,

13:19.256 --> 13:23.122
my Dad is on the news. The whole town is pissed about Fatso being stolen.

13:23.544 --> 13:27.094
I'll always remember where I was when I heard the news that Fatso was stolen.

13:27.761 --> 13:29.223
I was reading the paper in the can.

13:30.537 --> 13:31.687
It was the same way with Kennedy.

13:35.661 --> 13:41.828
Whoever stole this, you didn't just steal a clown, you stole a little piece of Point Place.

13:41.961 --> 13:44.261
And you should be ashamed of yourselves.

13:44.938 --> 13:47.171
I have a message for you from this man

13:49.174 --> 13:53.924
who is too choked up to speak. We will find you!

13:54.886 --> 13:57.553
WE WILL FIND YOU!

14:00.362 --> 14:04.108
Well kids, it looks like you're really in some deep *honk honk*

14:06.756 --> 14:07.578
You're not funny

14:10.629 --> 14:11.850
Why is it so damn funny?

14:18.881 --> 14:20.525
I knew we shouldn't have stolen that clown.

14:21.085 --> 14:23.632
If we wanted to get back at that Fatso burger guy,

14:23.785 --> 14:25.335
we should just have done what my Dad would have done.

14:25.756 --> 14:28.116
Hire the Sagito brothers to torch the place.

14:31.717 --> 14:33.983
This is big. The whole town is upset.

14:34.594 --> 14:37.024
Even my grandmother rolled down there to show her support.

14:38.174 --> 14:39.360
What the hell are we gonna do?

14:39.970 --> 14:42.389
It's so simple, it's so freakin' simple!

14:44.267 --> 14:46.638
All we need to do is get rid of the body.

14:47.848 --> 14:49.072
We need a hacksaw,

14:49.260 --> 14:52.324
a bunch of garbage bags and bathtub filled with acid.

14:54.715 --> 14:56.183
Yeah guys, this is serious.

14:56.635 --> 14:58.154
You know what the penalty for stealing a clown is?

14:58.518 --> 15:01.887
The cops line you up and shoot you with one of those guns that has a flag that says BANG.

15:04.066 --> 15:05.710
Hehe. I've been wanting to say that all day.

15:09.507 --> 15:11.045
What in the world?

15:13.055 --> 15:14.934
Okay Red, before you kill us one by one,

15:16.394 --> 15:17.322
let me just say this,

15:17.779 --> 15:18.519
it was HIS idea

15:21.059 --> 15:21.904
Nice going.

15:23.701 --> 15:25.015
I hate that ugly thing.

15:25.685 --> 15:27.340
It's always smiling when nothing is funny.

15:31.352 --> 15:31.941
Yeah so...

15:31.942 --> 15:33.167
You're not angry?

15:33.332 --> 15:34.447
What makes you think I'd be angry?

15:35.084 --> 15:37.644
Uhm every other experience we've ever had with you?

15:39.268 --> 15:40.665
Well I think it's hilarious.

15:40.735 --> 15:43.553
But Kitty is very upset. Apparently this thing is...

15:43.935 --> 15:45.520
some kind of symbol of our love.

15:45.813 --> 15:47.117
Help me toss it in the dumpster.

15:51.990 --> 15:54.138
Whoooo! I'm not touching that thing

15:56.134 --> 15:56.973
Well I don't have a grip...

15:59.891 --> 16:01.500
What is going on down there?!

16:01.582 --> 16:02.257
Hide the clown!

16:02.258 --> 16:02.827
AAAARRGGHHH!

16:02.862 --> 16:03.975
I don't want it!

16:03.976 --> 16:04.892
Don't give it to me!

16:04.893 --> 16:06.564
OH MY GOD!! IT IS LOOKING AT ME!

16:19.570 --> 16:21.590
What on earth was all that yelling?

16:22.318 --> 16:22.687
Oh...

16:22.964 --> 16:25.382
nothing. We were just The Boy in The Plastic Bubble.

16:26.193 --> 16:29.000
And someone came really near the bubble with a pair of scissors.

16:30.767 --> 16:34.302
Well did you kids hear that some vandals stole Fatso the Clown?

16:34.788 --> 16:36.561
Uh no, this is the first we're hearing it...

16:37.142 --> 16:39.197
Well I am just so upset about this that I...

16:39.608 --> 16:41.722
I need to make some comfort food. So oh,

16:42.218 --> 16:44.449
I came down here to get peas for a casserole

16:44.625 --> 16:45.635
NOOOOO!

16:47.492 --> 16:48.067
What?

16:49.654 --> 16:51.404
Aren't...fresh peas...better?

16:52.806 --> 16:53.804
Well don't be silly.

16:55.621 --> 16:56.936
Frozen peas are fine

16:58.527 --> 16:59.748
It's not a holiday.

17:02.238 --> 17:06.840
Okay let's see, peas, breadcrumbs...oh I forgot the corn

17:09.210 --> 17:13.898
HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!

17:16.923 --> 17:20.375
I can't believe you dismembered Fatso!

17:22.136 --> 17:26.175
What is the matter with you kids, this clown means something to people.

17:26.965 --> 17:28.563
Look how upset Red is!

17:32.027 --> 17:32.696
YES...

17:33.752 --> 17:34.656
upset!

17:35.537 --> 17:36.347
All of you...

17:37.280 --> 17:37.921
dumb-ass...

17:39.618 --> 17:41.097
Mrs. Forman, I can explain.

17:43.240 --> 17:44.673
There is nothing to do in this town.

17:45.700 --> 17:47.942
I am so disappointed in you.

17:48.742 --> 17:51.032
Especially after everything I have done for you,

17:51.033 --> 17:53.341
I openend my home, I have cooked you meals,

17:53.342 --> 17:56.218
I've loved you like your my own children.

17:56.873 --> 17:58.071
She did that for all of you?

18:00.068 --> 18:01.735
Men you guys are a bunch of jerks.

18:03.726 --> 18:04.236
Now,

18:04.999 --> 18:05.992
here's what you're gonna do.

18:06.676 --> 18:12.805
You're gonna glue poor Fatso back together and you are gonna take him back to his burger.

18:14.882 --> 18:15.587
Right Red?

18:16.870 --> 18:17.809
Ahem...YES...

18:19.332 --> 18:20.142
eh...because...if..

18:20.670 --> 18:21.410
if you don't...

18:22.279 --> 18:22.983
furious.

18:25.181 --> 18:26.332
Foots in asses!

18:32.031 --> 18:33.135
Holy hell.

18:34.481 --> 18:35.397
Did you see that?

18:37.292 --> 18:38.724
I've never seen Red so angry!

18:47.632 --> 18:49.240
I can't believe we're taking the clown back.

18:50.771 --> 18:52.086
You know what we should have done?

18:52.833 --> 18:54.571
Smash it into powder,

18:54.583 --> 18:58.878
mix it in the Fatsoburgers and force fed it to the redundant old fart who owns the place.

19:00.674 --> 19:02.072
Now that's sick!

19:03.527 --> 19:05.840
Oh my God Fez, there is a cop following us.

19:05.861 --> 19:06.302
Where?!

19:06.303 --> 19:08.216
Don't look, he's pulling up next to us.

19:08.709 --> 19:09.977
Hurry, cover that clown with your body.

19:11.607 --> 19:12.886
Make it look like you're making out with it!

19:17.463 --> 19:18.520
NO, I don't want to!

19:18.980 --> 19:20.683
KISS IT MAN! WE CAN'T GET CAUGHT NOW!

19:30.647 --> 19:32.748
Hey, someone put their old gum in his mouth!

19:35.931 --> 19:36.460
I DID THAT!

19:39.105 --> 19:41.171
There is no cop and you just kissed a clown!

19:42.844 --> 19:44.664
I can't believe I got to third base with a clown.

19:46.288 --> 19:47.959
Fez, there is nothing below his waist...

19:49.528 --> 19:50.680
I got a hold of something.

19:58.298 --> 20:01.371
I used to think criminals were stupid for returning to the scene of the crime.

20:01.961 --> 20:03.065
But I get it now.

20:03.660 --> 20:05.116
It's all about the rush!

20:07.758 --> 20:09.707
You know, now that I've seen Fatso make oout with Fez,

20:10.747 --> 20:12.262
he's not so scary anymore.

20:13.470 --> 20:13.823
See

20:15.273 --> 20:16.494
you're just a clown.

20:17.278 --> 20:18.357
A clown who wants to KILL YOU!

20:18.358 --> 20:19.666
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHH!

20:22.473 --> 20:23.088
So there it is.

20:23.358 --> 20:25.706
The clowns back, everyone is happy, none of us went to jail.

20:27.409 --> 20:28.254
What a waste of time.

20:30.390 --> 20:32.468
Well Randy, it looks like I've saved the day.

20:33.076 --> 20:34.309
Fatso is back on his bun.

20:35.107 --> 20:36.399
So all the bolts are nice and thight?

20:36.751 --> 20:37.385
Yes of course.

20:37.878 --> 20:39.005
I used to catch a little jingle:

20:39.557 --> 20:40.931
righty loosey, lefty tighty.

20:42.629 --> 20:44.144
That clown ain't going nowhere

20:51.348 --> 20:52.146
SHOTGUN!

20:57.555 --> 20:58.987
Im keepin' the nose!

21:12.412 --> 21:13.057
Ketchup?

21:19.272 --> 21:22.736
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHH!

21:23.305 --> 21:29.199
