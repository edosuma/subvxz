on a plate of aluminum.

it was to come by.

13:21.640 --> 13:25.326

of Charles Martin Hall

13:25.400 --> 13:27.402

aluminum from common dirt

13:27.480 --> 13:29.244
at almost no cost.

13:29.560 --> 13:32.643

You're gonna be okay.

37:10.480 --> 37:12.369
It's all gonna be all right.

37:13.560 --> 37:15.324
(SIGHS)
There's no stopping it.

37:15.400 --> 37:17.687
Every machine has an off switch.

37:18.520 --> 37:20.170
Not this one.

37:21.400 --> 37:23.289
TAYLOR: I swear I didn't
know what she was doing.

37:24.080 --> 37:25.445
I'm so sorry.

37:28.280 --> 37:30.851
What?
What is it?

37:33.520 --> 37:35.522
You should've never found me.

37:37.680 --> 37:38.920
Molly.

37:40.120 --> 37:41.360
I'm just here to help.

37:41.680 --> 37:44.889
People have been telling me
that my entire life,

37:45.880 --> 37:48.690
but all they want to do
is use me for my powers.

37:53.360 --> 37:55.601
You should understand that
better than anyone.

37:55.680 --> 37:58.604
I'm not proud of my past. You
know if I could change it...

37:58.880 --> 38:00.564
Forget about the past, Noah.

38:00.960 --> 38:04.521
This is about so much more
than you and me and June 13th.

38:04.600 --> 38:07.809
I was there in the hospital
when your daughter died.

38:09.520 --> 38:10.601
What happened?

38:14.880 --> 38:15.881
(SNIFFLING)

38:20.040 --> 38:21.963
We all knew what was at stake,

38:22.040 --> 38:24.725
and we agreed to do
whatever was necessary

38:24.920 --> 38:26.604
to keep them safe.

38:26.880 --> 38:28.644
- No, no!
- What are you doing?

38:28.720 --> 38:30.688
Erica tried to take
everything from me,

38:30.880 --> 38:32.644
but I was strong.

38:32.720 --> 38:34.404
(CRYING)
I was really strong,

38:35.400 --> 38:38.324
and I didn't give her
the location.

38:40.080 --> 38:41.286
Of what?

38:42.240 --> 38:44.561
If I tell you,
you won't go back.

38:45.560 --> 38:48.086
And then we're all dead anyway.

38:48.440 --> 38:50.408
You're not making any sense.

38:50.560 --> 38:52.289
I can't stop Erica,

38:52.480 --> 38:55.768
but I will not help her
kill seven billion people.

38:57.000 --> 38:58.286
TAYLOR: What?

38:58.760 --> 39:01.764
Molly, put the gun down

39:02.600 --> 39:04.568
and let's talk, okay?

39:05.600 --> 39:07.250
You're the only one
who can tell me

39:07.320 --> 39:09.766
what really happened
on June 13th.

39:11.080 --> 39:13.128
Forget the past, Noah.

39:15.800 --> 39:16.801
Save the future.

39:16.880 --> 39:18.041
NOAH: Molly, just...

39:18.120 --> 39:19.531
(GUNSHOT)
(ALL GASPING)

39:21.280 --> 39:22.964
(SOBBING)

39:29.760 --> 39:31.762
(ALARM BLARING)

39:38.640 --> 39:40.449
We can't leave her like this.

39:40.520 --> 39:43.490
If we don't, we're gonna
end up just like her.

39:43.840 --> 39:45.649
Come on, man.
We got to go.

39:49.440 --> 39:51.886
Find them.
They can't be far.

39:56.960 --> 40:00.328
We just lost Molly Walker.
Gunshot wound.

40:00.520 --> 40:01.965
Self-inflicted.

40:02.320 --> 40:04.721
How exactly did she manage
to get her hands on a gun?

40:04.800 --> 40:07.280
Security ID'd Noah Bennet,
and...

40:07.480 --> 40:09.448
Well, there's no way
to put this delicately.

40:09.520 --> 40:10.851
He was with your daughter.

40:15.160 --> 40:16.321
Bring them to me.

40:18.400 --> 40:19.845
What about EPIC?

40:20.560 --> 40:22.483
Local tracking
still functions properly.

40:22.560 --> 40:24.244
As long as you're
within 100 feet of an Evo,

40:24.320 --> 40:25.526
they'll all register
on the device.

40:26.040 --> 40:27.371
But remote locations?

40:27.440 --> 40:28.521
Not without the girl.

40:28.800 --> 40:31.849
At least tell me we found
it before she died.

40:33.800 --> 40:35.006
(SCOFFS)

40:35.800 --> 40:36.847
Lovely.

40:38.520 --> 40:41.603
It's only the future of the entire
human race hanging in the balance.

40:41.680 --> 40:43.125
Before global tracking
went down,

40:43.200 --> 40:46.727
EPIC did pick up a signal in
Canada that showed some potential.

40:46.840 --> 40:48.888
It's too late
for potential, Mr. Harris.

40:56.640 --> 40:58.927
I need you to find me
that child.

40:59.560 --> 41:01.927
And when you do,
I need you to kill it.

41:02.000 --> 41:03.286
I'll put my usual team on it.

41:03.360 --> 41:04.691
No.

41:05.720 --> 41:07.882
This is too important.

41:08.760 --> 41:10.649
This time, you're taking
the Shadow.

41:16.240 --> 41:18.607
SURESH: <i>We all have
a unique purpose,</i>

41:18.960 --> 41:22.567
<i>and try as we might,
we cannot run from it.</i>

41:23.400 --> 41:25.687
<i>The only question that remains,</i>

41:26.240 --> 41:29.289
<i>will we be able to stay
true to who we are,</i>

41:30.000 --> 41:33.368
<i>or will we succumb
to the pressure of destiny</i>

41:34.000 --> 41:36.321
<i>and become something
else entirely?</i>

41:38.800 --> 41:41.565
<i>Something inhuman?</i>

41:44.500 --> 41:52.500
