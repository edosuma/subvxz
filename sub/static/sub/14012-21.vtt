<i>In the criminal justice system,</i>
<i> the people are represented</i>

00:04.772 --> 00:07.439
<i> by two separte</i>
<i> yet equally important groups:</i>

00:07.441 --> 00:09.408
<i> The police,</i>
<i> who investigate crime,</i>

00:09.410 --> 00:12.177
<i> and the district attorneys,</i>
<i> who prosecute the offenders.</i>

00:12.179 --> 00:14.546
<i> These are their stories.</i>

00:14.548 --> 00:18.517
(<i> horns honking,</i>
<i> car alarm blaring</i> )

00:18.519 --> 00:21.387
MAN:
<i>It doesn't bother you at all,</i>
<i> does it?</i>

00:21.389 --> 00:24.156
To you it's like talking
about a new pair of shoes.

00:24.158 --> 00:25.357
For God's sake,
she's family.

00:25.359 --> 00:27.559
Would I discuss this
with<i> my</i> sister?

00:27.561 --> 00:29.294
Sally's a therapist.

00:29.296 --> 00:32.297
The problem is not
with the big head, Jessie.

00:32.299 --> 00:34.166
You're being childish.

00:34.168 --> 00:36.535
You folks hear Howard
this morning?

00:36.537 --> 00:39.038
He went off
on some poor broad.

00:39.040 --> 00:40.572
You mind?

00:43.210 --> 00:44.510
DRIVER:
Look out!

00:44.512 --> 00:46.545
(<i> tires screeching</i> )

00:48.382 --> 00:50.182
MAN:
What the hell you doing?

00:50.184 --> 00:52.418
(<i> horns honking</i> )

00:59.460 --> 01:03.128
POLICE OFFICER:
All right, keep back, folks.

01:03.130 --> 01:04.530
Mikey.

01:04.532 --> 01:06.265
Yeah.

01:06.267 --> 01:08.267
No see and no hear.

01:08.269 --> 01:10.669
Eight million people,
and you die alone.

01:10.671 --> 01:13.272
What's the morning headline?

01:13.274 --> 01:15.541
MAN:
"Man Kisses Tenth Avenue."

01:15.543 --> 01:17.543
The kiss of death.

01:17.544 --> 01:19.544
But his face wasn't crushed
from a knife wound.

01:19.547 --> 01:23.082
He must have come
from that bridge.

01:24.552 --> 01:26.585
Let's see
what we got.

01:29.156 --> 01:31.657
And the winner is...
James Vogel.

01:31.659 --> 01:33.559
Whoa.

01:33.561 --> 01:36.361
Make that Councilman Vogel.

01:37.665 --> 01:41.300
The 16th District is
a long way from home.

01:41.302 --> 01:44.269
20, 40, 60, 80...

01:44.271 --> 01:47.272
83 bucks
and a full deck of plastic.

01:47.274 --> 01:49.274
Too busy to rob him.

01:49.276 --> 01:50.642
A disgruntled voter?

01:50.644 --> 01:54.546
Or a contributor who wasn't
getting his money's worth.

01:54.548 --> 01:57.616
It's a hell of a way
to leave office.

02:02.289 --> 02:06.358
   Captioning sponsored by
   NBC/Universal

03:22.403 --> 03:24.937
Vogel attended a benefit
for the New York Women's

03:24.939 --> 03:27.272
Foundation
of the Democratic Club.

03:27.274 --> 03:30.275
The doorman says he left
by himself after 10:30.

03:30.277 --> 03:33.412
Five minutes later,
a half gainer off the high dive.

03:33.414 --> 03:36.281
If anybody saw this,
they didn't stay to tell.

03:36.283 --> 03:38.250
Maybe some witness
will show up.

03:38.252 --> 03:40.619
Maybe I'll grow wings
and learn to fly.

03:40.621 --> 03:43.388
I sat on a panel
last year with Vogel--

03:43.390 --> 03:45.924
safe schools, juvenile violence.

03:45.926 --> 03:48.493
Lot of grandstanding,
but not Vogel.

03:48.495 --> 03:51.296
This guy
is one of the good ones.

03:51.298 --> 03:53.599
Good guys can step
on the wrong toes.

03:53.601 --> 03:57.336
In politics, there's bound
to be some sore losers.

03:57.338 --> 03:59.538
I want this one
in the win column.

03:59.540 --> 04:03.542
In addition to the impact wounds
from the fall and the car

04:03.544 --> 04:06.478
he had blunt-force wounds
across the front of his body.

04:06.480 --> 04:08.647
Started out
just wanting to hurt him.

04:08.649 --> 04:10.549
And for a dime or a dollar,

04:10.551 --> 04:12.584
doesn't make
much difference now.

04:12.586 --> 04:15.587
We have a dorsal wound,
one upward thrust.nt--

04:15.589 --> 04:17.389
The blade entered
the abdominal cavity

04:17.391 --> 04:20.325
under the rib cage,
the kidney,p through

04:20.327 --> 04:21.893
and transected
the renal vein.

04:21.895 --> 04:24.396
LOGAN:
and he's gone.

04:24.398 --> 04:26.665
Internal bleeding--
no pain, no stain.

04:26.667 --> 04:29.501
CERRETA:
Mark of a craftsman.

04:29.503 --> 04:33.338
WOMAN:
<i> for literacy programs,</i>

04:33.340 --> 04:35.374
rights for elderly tenants--

04:35.376 --> 04:38.277
hardly anything
you'd call controversial.

04:38.279 --> 04:40.412
A few landlords
might beg to differ.

04:40.414 --> 04:42.047
He built bridges,
not walls.

04:42.049 --> 04:45.684
I ran his constituents office
for eight years.

04:45.686 --> 04:49.454
I do not know a single enemy
that he didn't win over.

04:49.456 --> 04:50.622
What about allies?

04:50.624 --> 04:52.357
Did he owe any favors?

04:52.359 --> 04:54.559
He said favors
get you in trouble.

04:54.561 --> 04:56.995
CERRETA:
Was he ambitious?

04:56.997 --> 05:00.365
In right amounts, yes,
but nobody owned him.

05:00.367 --> 05:03.035
Maybe they had
a short-term lease.

05:03.037 --> 05:07.372
Now, here are two deposits
to his money market account.

05:07.374 --> 05:09.508
One was eight months ago.

05:09.510 --> 05:11.076
This one three months ago.

05:11.078 --> 05:13.345
It's a total of 50 grand.

05:13.347 --> 05:14.713
Did he win the lotto?

05:14.715 --> 05:18.083
I wouldn't know
where that came from.

05:18.085 --> 05:20.385
Well, we've got
the bank number.

05:20.387 --> 05:22.087
If they're checks

05:22.089 --> 05:24.489
we'll go
to the issuing account.

05:24.491 --> 05:26.058
My hunch?

05:26.060 --> 05:29.328
Wherever it's from,
lotto would have been better.

05:29.330 --> 05:31.463
I lent him the money.

05:31.465 --> 05:33.965
The father is an easy touch.

05:33.967 --> 05:36.535
CERRETA:
In my family,
we don't write

05:36.537 --> 05:38.337
blank checks.

05:38.339 --> 05:40.672
VOGEL:
He asked
and I gave.

05:40.674 --> 05:43.408
If he'd wanted me to know
what it was for,

05:43.410 --> 05:44.643
he would have told me.

05:44.645 --> 05:46.345
Maybe he told your wife?

05:46.347 --> 05:48.747
Judith passed away
six years ago.

05:48.749 --> 05:51.016
LOGAN:
Was there
anyone else

05:51.018 --> 05:53.418
he might have confided in--
maybe a girlfriend?

05:54.088 --> 05:57.389
James kept his own counsel.

05:57.391 --> 06:01.093
I don't see what this money
has to do with his death.

06:01.095 --> 06:04.096
Some piece of filth held him up.

06:04.098 --> 06:06.365
Robbery wasn't the motive.

06:06.367 --> 06:09.768
And you're looking for a motive?

06:09.770 --> 06:13.405
How about
just for the hell of it?

06:13.407 --> 06:15.707
That's a popular one
these days.

06:15.709 --> 06:20.145
Or someone just doesn't like
the look on his face.

06:20.147 --> 06:22.547
My family worked damn hard

06:22.549 --> 06:27.152
to improve the quality of life
in this city, and this...

06:27.154 --> 06:30.555
this is how they pay us back.

06:30.557 --> 06:33.592
Vogel wasn't exactly a tightwad.

06:33.594 --> 06:36.661
Tapped into his stash
every other Friday.

06:38.599 --> 06:40.132
$5,000 a month.

06:40.134 --> 06:41.867
In cash.

06:41.869 --> 06:45.470
Except for
the last couple of weeks.

06:45.472 --> 06:47.406
Plenty of money left

06:47.408 --> 06:49.408
but no cash withdrawals.

06:49.410 --> 06:51.810
Well, whatever
he was paying off,

06:51.812 --> 06:53.612
he changed his mind.

06:53.614 --> 06:56.148
In hock
to the bank of broken legs?

06:56.150 --> 06:57.549
I can't see how.

06:57.551 --> 06:58.750
He was a monk.

06:58.752 --> 07:00.552
He covered the basics
with his salary.

07:00.554 --> 07:02.821
He paid his credit cards
every month like clockwork.

07:04.825 --> 07:06.758
Maybe he's a sports nut.

07:06.760 --> 07:10.429
No. Bookies collect
in cash, not bodies.

07:12.900 --> 07:15.167
Mullen's, in Soho.

07:15.169 --> 07:17.769
Charges every...

07:17.771 --> 07:19.604
week.

07:19.606 --> 07:24.209
Didn't vice do a number on them
a year ago?

07:26.180 --> 07:28.647
Your colleagues in vice probably
got the wrong impression.

07:28.649 --> 07:31.183
People come here to feel safe,
nothing more.

07:31.185 --> 07:32.684
Vogel was a regular?

07:32.686 --> 07:34.886
Who is and who isn't
is nobody's business.

07:34.888 --> 07:38.890
Unless it's a police matter,
Mr. Drotos, which this is.

07:42.196 --> 07:44.796
He was already
halfway there anyway.

07:44.798 --> 07:46.531
How's that?

07:46.533 --> 07:50.168
James was talking about
turning his life around--

07:50.170 --> 07:51.903
taking the big step.

07:51.905 --> 07:53.572
The big step?

07:53.574 --> 07:55.841
Coming out of the closet.

07:55.843 --> 07:58.844
He was wondering how well
he would handle it.

07:58.846 --> 08:01.146
He worried
about family, career.

08:01.148 --> 08:03.482
He never expected
to lose his life.

08:03.484 --> 08:07.185
What are you saying,
that this is gay bashing?
In the past year--

08:07.187 --> 08:10.489
just the ones
that were reported--
30, 40 beatings.

08:10.491 --> 08:13.758
Staying in the closet
isn't a matter of conceit.

08:13.760 --> 08:16.728
Sometimes it's a matter
of life and death.

08:16.730 --> 08:18.864
been thinking
You said he had

08:18.866 --> 08:20.599
about coming out

08:20.601 --> 08:23.168
but he hadn't
actually done so yet.

08:23.170 --> 08:26.838
Someone was going
to do it for him.

08:28.842 --> 08:30.709
Outing's a specialty.

08:30.711 --> 08:33.612
James got a call
from them last week.

08:33.614 --> 08:36.181
They were preparing
an article.

08:36.183 --> 08:37.883
MAN:
<i> I'm sorry</i>

08:37.885 --> 08:40.185
about what happened
to James Vogel.

08:40.187 --> 08:42.587
I'm even sorrier
he didn't come out

08:42.589 --> 08:43.955
while he was
still alive.

08:43.957 --> 08:46.758
Or stick around
to watch you do it for him?

08:46.760 --> 08:49.528
Outing is an act of
self-defense, Detective.
We're at war.

08:49.530 --> 08:52.297
The more of us that come out,
the stronger we are.

08:52.299 --> 08:54.900
Well, who are you at war with?

08:54.902 --> 08:57.002
Vogel could have been
a role model.

08:57.004 --> 08:58.737
Shouldn't that be

08:58.739 --> 09:00.005
his decision?

09:00.007 --> 09:02.574
I didn't target the man,
but when the information

09:02.576 --> 09:05.744
lands on my desk,
I can't ignore it.
Are you so sure

09:05.746 --> 09:06.945
the information
is reliable?

09:06.947 --> 09:08.847
There's documentation--

09:08.849 --> 09:11.016
personal letters
in Vogel's hand.

09:11.018 --> 09:14.286
May we see those letters?
If I were running a
public library, maybe.

09:14.288 --> 09:18.290
The person who gave them to you
probably blackmailed Vogel.

09:18.292 --> 09:21.860
Much as I'd like to believe you,
the answer is still no.

09:21.862 --> 09:23.962
my sources.
I got to protect

09:23.964 --> 09:25.263
Then we get

09:25.265 --> 09:27.032
witness warrant.
a material

09:27.034 --> 09:30.268
And you sit in a cell
until we see those letters.

09:30.270 --> 09:33.004
Then I'd better pack
my toothbrush.

09:33.006 --> 09:36.841
As soon as you get your warrant,
let me know.

09:41.782 --> 09:44.649
I met with his colleagues
on occasion.

09:44.651 --> 09:46.685
That's about it.

09:46.687 --> 09:49.688
James moved out
when he was 18.

09:49.690 --> 09:52.924
I haven't kept track
of his friends

09:52.926 --> 09:54.659
in a long time.

09:54.661 --> 09:56.928
What about
intimate friends?

09:56.930 --> 09:58.964
Did he ever talk
about them?

09:58.966 --> 10:02.000
There was
a girl or two at Columbia.

10:02.002 --> 10:03.735
CERRETA:
Uh, Mr. Vogel,

10:03.737 --> 10:07.005
the more open you are,
the easier this is going to be.

10:07.007 --> 10:08.940
What do you mean?

10:08.942 --> 10:10.642
We're already aware

10:10.644 --> 10:13.044
of your son's
sexual orientation.

10:13.046 --> 10:15.013
Do you know how many years

10:15.015 --> 10:18.049
we've been subjected
to rumors like that?

10:18.051 --> 10:21.653
Once you're in office,
everyone takes shots at you.

10:21.655 --> 10:24.923
So you're saying
that your son was not gay?

10:24.925 --> 10:26.658
Of course he wasn't!

10:26.660 --> 10:28.927
Those freaks in the West Village

10:28.929 --> 10:32.831
would have liked to claim James
as one of their own.

10:32.833 --> 10:35.934
I don't know how close
you were with your son,

10:35.936 --> 10:38.003
but our information
seems reliable.

10:38.005 --> 10:39.904
Oh, yes, I'm sure.

10:39.906 --> 10:41.973
Reliable political sources.

10:41.975 --> 10:45.710
We also suspect that your son
was being blackmailed.

10:45.712 --> 10:47.012
The $50,000.

10:47.014 --> 10:48.980
What about it?

10:48.982 --> 10:52.083
It's hard to believe you gave
him that without questions.

10:52.085 --> 10:53.852
I told you I trusted him.

10:53.854 --> 10:56.054
But weren't you concerned?

10:56.056 --> 10:59.124
VOGEL:
I assumed he had some problem
to take care of.

10:59.126 --> 11:01.960
CERRETA:
You didn't ask any specifics?

11:01.962 --> 11:04.095
VOGEL:
He was 41 years old.

11:04.097 --> 11:06.431
I respected his privacy.

11:06.433 --> 11:09.934
Or maybe
you just didn't want to know.

11:09.936 --> 11:14.439
Your son ever mention
anybody named Harold?

11:16.076 --> 11:17.776
No.

11:17.778 --> 11:20.378
Addressed "James V.,"
Signed "Harold."

11:20.380 --> 11:22.914
Letters dating back
a year and a half.

11:22.916 --> 11:25.316
It's definitely
not business.

11:25.318 --> 11:27.786
Look at the return
P.O. box Ossining.

11:27.788 --> 11:29.320
State penitentiary.

11:29.322 --> 11:32.691
Your son's pen pal
is a long-term resident.

11:37.230 --> 11:39.197
Harold Dwyer:
served six years in Ossining

11:39.199 --> 11:41.266
for grand larceny
and assault.

11:41.268 --> 11:42.834
Released
two weeks ago.

11:42.836 --> 11:44.869
Hobbies include mail fraud,
forgery,

11:44.871 --> 11:46.337
receiving of stolen goods.

11:46.339 --> 11:49.074
In 1983 Dwyer impersonated
a police officer

11:49.076 --> 11:51.876
and stole two Porsches
out of the impound.

11:51.878 --> 11:54.312
Plenty of moxie.

11:54.314 --> 11:57.182
Basic requirements
for blackmail and murder.

11:57.184 --> 12:00.018
Anything in the letters
he wrote to Vogel?

12:00.020 --> 12:02.153
Nothing he'd lose sleep over.

12:02.155 --> 12:05.156
Sounded like one of Vogel's
rehab projects.

12:05.158 --> 12:06.891
Do you think Mr. Dwyer

12:06.893 --> 12:09.360
would think of himself
as a project?

12:11.031 --> 12:13.898
<i> Nickel and change</i>
<i> is a long stretch.</i>

12:13.900 --> 12:19.037
Checkers and Oprah
only eat up so much of it.

12:19.039 --> 12:21.306
You look for things to do.

12:21.308 --> 12:22.974
Like pen pals?

12:22.976 --> 12:25.043
Like pen pals.

12:25.045 --> 12:26.344
How did you meet Vogel?

12:26.346 --> 12:29.347
I put a personal
in<i> The Advocate.</i>

12:29.349 --> 12:31.349
He sent me a letter.

12:31.351 --> 12:34.219
We started a little...
correspondence.

12:34.221 --> 12:36.354
Mm-hmm. Casual correspondence?

12:36.356 --> 12:37.388
Conversation.

12:37.390 --> 12:39.324
Like guys sitting at a bar.

12:39.326 --> 12:41.092
We got the idea

12:41.094 --> 12:44.062
you talked about more
than the latest scores.

12:44.064 --> 12:47.198
So? It went a little deeper
than that.

12:47.200 --> 12:51.236
Whose idea was it to take it
in that direction, yours?

12:51.238 --> 12:52.837
A man gets lonely.

12:52.839 --> 12:55.940
You got a problem with that?

12:55.942 --> 12:58.076
I got a problem
when he's greedy.

12:58.078 --> 13:00.211
What are you talking about?

13:00.213 --> 13:02.113
Vogel's money
buys your silence.

13:02.115 --> 13:03.248
Come on.

13:03.250 --> 13:06.317
I didn't even know
his last name.

13:06.319 --> 13:08.153
You knew
his mailing address.

13:08.155 --> 13:09.988
You knew he was vulnerable.

13:09.990 --> 13:12.924
A smart guy like you
can figure that out.

13:12.926 --> 13:15.360
So smart that I'm taking
his shakedown money

13:15.362 --> 13:18.096
and living in a dump like this.

13:18.098 --> 13:21.199
The guy said he'd
help me get on my feet.

13:21.201 --> 13:26.271
I look stupid enough
to blackmail him?

13:26.273 --> 13:28.973
Truth or dare--
you ever play as a kid?

13:28.975 --> 13:32.477
Stakes go up until someone
opens their mouth and steps in.

13:32.479 --> 13:35.346
The adult version starts
with a personal ad.

13:35.348 --> 13:38.349
Vogel bites, Dwyer plays him
till the prose turns purple.

13:38.351 --> 13:40.151
And the trap slams shut.

13:40.153 --> 13:43.021
You think Vogel's
the only one who got caught?

13:43.023 --> 13:48.126
Prisons keep records of their
prisoners' correspondence.

13:48.128 --> 13:51.196
Aside from his family
and legal representation,

13:51.198 --> 13:53.198
Harold Dwyer
maintained a correspondence

13:53.200 --> 13:54.499
with several other people.

13:54.501 --> 13:57.202
Did you inspect
his incoming mail?

13:57.204 --> 13:59.137
Only for contraband.

13:59.139 --> 14:01.206
What about outgoing letters?

14:01.208 --> 14:02.407
Were the contents examined?

14:02.409 --> 14:04.375
You mean read?

14:04.377 --> 14:08.279
Prisoners submit outgoing mail
to us unsealed for inspection.

14:08.281 --> 14:10.415
We don't read
every word they write.

14:10.417 --> 14:13.284
But you would record
the people he wrote to.

14:13.286 --> 14:15.286
As a matter of routine,

14:15.288 --> 14:17.388
along with his visitors,
phone calls.

14:17.390 --> 14:20.158
We'll take copies
of everything you have.

14:20.160 --> 14:22.427
Harold Dwyer
was a model prisoner.

14:22.429 --> 14:25.964
Even taught some high school
equivalency classes.

14:25.966 --> 14:28.466
Didn't expect him
to get in trouble so soon.

14:28.468 --> 14:30.235
Geez, what a shock.

14:30.237 --> 14:36.040
Six correspondents, all male,
all in the New York City area.

14:36.042 --> 14:38.243
I saw his personal
in<i> The Advocate.</i>

14:38.245 --> 14:40.245
I felt sorry for him.

14:40.247 --> 14:42.347
Every con has a sob story.

14:42.349 --> 14:44.115
I was curious.

14:44.117 --> 14:46.117
Dwyer's letters
were very clever,

14:46.119 --> 14:48.553
not what I expected
from someone in jail.

14:48.555 --> 14:51.155
CERRETA:
Being clever
got him there.

14:51.157 --> 14:54.192
I told myself
at least he's not a murderer.

14:54.194 --> 14:56.194
So you wrote.

14:56.196 --> 14:59.464
And he started sending me
these raunchy letters--

14:59.466 --> 15:01.232
wanted me to respond.

15:01.234 --> 15:03.001
I wasn't into it.

15:03.003 --> 15:04.335
I stopped writing.

15:04.337 --> 15:06.170
That it?

15:06.172 --> 15:09.073
A few weeks later
I get a call at home.

15:09.075 --> 15:10.041
No name.

15:10.043 --> 15:11.442
Said he was Dwyer's friend.

15:11.444 --> 15:14.078
I thought it might be him,
but...

15:14.080 --> 15:15.313
Was the call
collect?

15:15.315 --> 15:17.248
I don't... does it matter?

15:17.250 --> 15:18.516
Inmates can only call collect.

15:18.518 --> 15:19.517
No.

15:19.519 --> 15:21.386
I'm pretty sure it wasn't.

15:21.388 --> 15:23.254
What else did he say?

15:23.256 --> 15:25.023
He told me

15:25.025 --> 15:28.293
that he had the letters
that I wrote to Dwyer.

15:28.295 --> 15:30.228
Did he threaten you?

15:30.230 --> 15:31.396
Not directly.

15:31.398 --> 15:33.164
He was slick--

15:33.166 --> 15:35.099
slick and kind of pushy.

15:35.101 --> 15:37.268
He wanted money--
$5,000 a month.

15:37.270 --> 15:40.004
He said he'd have
a courier pick it up.

15:40.006 --> 15:41.372
You agreed to pay him?

15:41.374 --> 15:42.473
Oh, please.

15:42.475 --> 15:44.475
I told him to get lost.

15:44.477 --> 15:46.611
Even though he had your letters?

15:46.613 --> 15:48.246
Hey, I'm gay.

15:48.248 --> 15:51.449
If he wants to broadcast it,
what do I care?

15:51.451 --> 15:53.217
This will only take

15:53.219 --> 15:56.321
a couple of minutes
of your time...

15:56.323 --> 15:58.222
Thank you.

15:58.224 --> 16:01.259
Yes, sir, I do appreciate
your situation.

16:01.261 --> 16:03.594
If you could help me,
I... Hello?

16:05.332 --> 16:07.665
Mr. Harris makes oh-for-six.

16:07.667 --> 16:10.034
Three of these guys are married.

16:10.036 --> 16:11.235
You got to love blackmail.

16:11.237 --> 16:13.404
No one points the finger at you

16:13.406 --> 16:16.507
for the same reason
they're paying you off.

16:16.509 --> 16:18.276
Maybe we can get
the blackmailers

16:18.278 --> 16:20.511
to point the finger
at each other.

16:20.513 --> 16:23.147
Dwyer had somebody
on the outside helping him.

16:23.149 --> 16:26.417
Would have had to talk
to him before he got out.

16:26.419 --> 16:29.220
Do you want to do
phones or visitors?

16:29.222 --> 16:31.706
Phones.

16:31.707 --> 16:34.191
Can't say Dwyer
didn't make an effort.

16:34.194 --> 16:38.162
Called his wife in Binghampton
every Sunday night.

16:38.164 --> 16:40.431
Twice a month he had visits
from a Lisa Torres.

16:40.433 --> 16:44.335
Even money on which one got
the flowers on Valentine's.

16:48.208 --> 16:50.274
Don't rule out his lawyer.

16:50.276 --> 16:52.410
Dwyer saw him
once a week.

16:52.412 --> 16:54.178
He was already
convicted.

16:54.180 --> 16:56.514
And isn't six years
late for appeals?

16:56.516 --> 16:58.583
So why all the traffic?

16:58.585 --> 17:00.251
The architect said

17:00.253 --> 17:02.587
the guy on the phone
was slick and pushy.

17:02.589 --> 17:05.523
A lawyer, slick and pushy?

17:07.260 --> 17:10.395
<i> Mr. Dwyer has legal problems</i>
<i> dating back 15 years.</i>

17:10.397 --> 17:12.263
It keeps me very busy.

17:12.265 --> 17:15.099
Ossining is a good
hour and a half away.

17:15.101 --> 17:17.101
You never used the telephone?

17:17.103 --> 17:20.204
What, are you worried
i'm overcharging him?

17:20.206 --> 17:22.206
You ever talk
to a Jay Lingard?

17:22.208 --> 17:23.608
I never heard of him.

17:23.610 --> 17:25.209
He's an architect--

17:25.211 --> 17:27.745
one of Dwyer's pen pals
while he was in prison.

17:27.747 --> 17:29.747
I don't get the connection.

17:29.749 --> 17:31.349
What about James Vogel?

17:31.351 --> 17:33.217
I'm sure you've heard of him.

17:33.219 --> 17:36.187
Vogel. You mean the councilman
who was mugged.

17:36.189 --> 17:38.222
So someone would like us

17:38.224 --> 17:39.290
to believe.

17:39.292 --> 17:40.358
And you think

17:40.360 --> 17:42.226
my client's somehow involved?

17:42.228 --> 17:44.228
He exchanged letters
with Mr. Vogel.

17:44.230 --> 17:46.230
What a coincidence.

17:46.232 --> 17:48.633
I'm sure Mr. Vogel
wrote his congressman.

17:48.635 --> 17:50.234
Is he a suspect?

17:50.236 --> 17:53.237
If there were indications
of blackmail, mm-hmm.

17:53.239 --> 17:55.640
Dwyer did all this when,
in prison?

17:55.642 --> 17:58.242
He's been out
less than two weeks.

17:58.244 --> 18:01.312
We think he had an accomplice
on the outside.

18:02.482 --> 18:04.148
Clever, boys.

18:04.150 --> 18:07.151
You want to play
"I got a secret,"

18:07.153 --> 18:09.187
you play with my lawyer.

18:09.189 --> 18:10.388
Name's Bowman.

18:10.390 --> 18:12.490
She's in the phone book.

18:12.492 --> 18:15.393
Vogel was paying out
five grand a month,

18:15.395 --> 18:16.794
then one day he stops.

18:16.796 --> 18:18.262
He wants out.

18:18.264 --> 18:19.664
He starts making noise.

18:19.666 --> 18:22.266
Dwyer and Colson
look to shut him up.

18:22.268 --> 18:25.269
So they send the letters
to the magazine

18:25.271 --> 18:27.405
and word gets out
about Vogel.

18:27.407 --> 18:29.407
The hit looks
like a gay bash.

18:29.409 --> 18:31.642
Only we can't
connect Colson to Vogel.

18:31.644 --> 18:34.378
We could check his LUD's,
but I don't think

18:34.380 --> 18:37.281
he'd call somebody
from his office that
he's blackmailing.

18:37.283 --> 18:40.184
What are you looking at?
Mailroom.

18:40.186 --> 18:42.186
Lingard mentioned a courier.

18:42.188 --> 18:43.588
<i> I know the routine.</i>

18:43.590 --> 18:46.224
I blab to you,
Mr. Colson finds out,

18:46.226 --> 18:47.792
then what,
i work for you?

18:47.794 --> 18:50.361
You can shoot a gun,
you got a job.

18:50.363 --> 18:54.232
Yeah? You know where
I'd point it first?

18:54.234 --> 18:57.635
We play by the book,
I got to get a subpoena

18:57.637 --> 18:59.770
you spend a day
in the precinct.

18:59.772 --> 19:01.506
Like I'd mind.

19:01.508 --> 19:03.808
You'd lose a day's pay.

19:03.810 --> 19:09.547
Nice. This how you
get dates, too?

19:09.549 --> 19:12.283
Mr. Colson
has a regular service.

19:12.285 --> 19:14.318
Comes by once a week.

19:14.320 --> 19:16.320
Bringing what?

19:16.322 --> 19:17.822
Packages.

19:17.824 --> 19:20.691
What do you think,
they're transparent?

19:20.693 --> 19:22.426
They go up to his office.

19:22.428 --> 19:24.428
He signs for them.

19:24.430 --> 19:27.865
What's the name
of the service?

19:27.867 --> 19:31.702
Yeah, sure,
he has an account here.

19:31.704 --> 19:36.874
Uh, three or four pickups
every other Friday or so.

19:36.876 --> 19:39.410
Pickups from where?

19:39.412 --> 19:40.478
It depends.

19:40.480 --> 19:42.313
Upper Manhattan,
Brooklyn, Jersey.

19:42.315 --> 19:44.849
What about a James Vogel
in Park Slope?

19:44.851 --> 19:46.450
Is this guy Colson

19:46.452 --> 19:49.453
in some kind of trouble?

19:49.455 --> 19:51.455
Do you really care?

19:51.457 --> 19:52.823
He tips.

19:52.825 --> 19:54.559
Most don't.

19:54.561 --> 19:55.793
Here.

19:55.795 --> 19:58.696
No name on the pickup order.

19:58.698 --> 20:00.865
But we did do Park Slope

20:00.867 --> 20:03.634
every other week
until last month.

20:03.636 --> 20:05.870
The next time you get

20:05.872 --> 20:07.805
a pickup order from Colson,
you call us,

20:07.807 --> 20:11.342
but that's before you
deliver the package.

20:11.344 --> 20:12.743
Find some other way.

20:12.745 --> 20:14.345
I got a schedule here.

20:14.347 --> 20:15.613
Come on, sweetheart,

20:15.615 --> 20:17.882
you're too busy
to make one call?

20:17.884 --> 20:19.550
Maybe we need a warrant

20:19.552 --> 20:21.552
on every package
that comes through.

20:21.554 --> 20:23.454
This isn't right.

20:23.456 --> 20:25.456
I've cooperated plenty already.

20:25.458 --> 20:26.591
Yeah, okay.

20:26.593 --> 20:29.327
Then one more time
won't kill you.

20:31.364 --> 20:34.732
<i> The official line is,</i>
<i> Councilman Vogel</i>

20:34.734 --> 20:37.301
was the unfortunate victim
of a street mugging.

20:37.303 --> 20:39.770
Anything else is speculation
we have no comment on.

20:39.772 --> 20:41.906
this story's
If we make an arrest,

20:41.908 --> 20:43.474
gonna come out.

20:43.476 --> 20:45.643
Long as it doesn't come from us.

20:45.645 --> 20:48.546
What are we hiding,
the fact that he was gay?

20:48.548 --> 20:50.881
This comes from division?

20:50.883 --> 20:52.850
Right from the top.

20:52.852 --> 20:55.686
So Edward Vogel pays a visit
to the chief...

20:55.688 --> 20:58.823
One five-minute phone call.

20:58.825 --> 21:01.692
He's doing his son a favor
by being ashamed?

21:01.694 --> 21:04.795
How close are we on this?

21:04.797 --> 21:06.764
We get a hit
on this delivery...

21:06.766 --> 21:10.434
The courier has a delivery
for Colson from Kew Gardens.

21:10.436 --> 21:12.536
to a certain
Dwyer was writing

21:12.538 --> 21:14.639
George Harris over there.

21:14.640 --> 21:16.741
We're waiting for a call
on the delivery time.

21:16.743 --> 21:18.342
We checked Dwyer's alibi.

21:18.344 --> 21:20.978
He says he got tanked
in some dive on Mulberry.

21:20.980 --> 21:22.780
Barkeep remembers him
stumbling out

21:22.782 --> 21:25.683
half past midnight,
but not when he came in.

21:25.685 --> 21:26.917
(<i> phone rings</i> )

21:26.919 --> 21:28.819
What?

21:28.821 --> 21:30.521
Yeah.

21:31.491 --> 21:33.858
Cerreta.

21:33.860 --> 21:36.127
Okay. Thanks.

21:36.128 --> 21:38.395
Courier service will be
at Colson's in 20 minutes.

21:38.398 --> 21:40.665
Get going.
I'll cover the warrant for you.

21:51.511 --> 21:54.478
Mr. Colson, did you
just receive a package

21:54.480 --> 21:55.913
from B&C Couriers?

21:55.915 --> 21:57.982
What is this all about?

21:57.984 --> 21:59.684
Is that it there?

21:59.686 --> 22:00.885
The warrant first.

22:00.887 --> 22:02.420
It's on its way.

22:02.422 --> 22:04.488
Do you want to wait,

22:04.490 --> 22:08.592
or do you want
to open it yourself?

22:17.503 --> 22:20.971
Would you please accompany us
to the precinct?

22:24.344 --> 22:26.344
I asked my client about
a delinquent bill.

22:26.346 --> 22:27.511
He says send
a messenger.

22:27.513 --> 22:29.513
I had no idea...
There's nothing illegal

22:29.515 --> 22:31.482
about getting paid
in cash, Detective.

22:31.484 --> 22:33.617
That depends on the source,
Counselor.

22:33.619 --> 22:37.355
We'd like to help you
with this investigation,
but any communication

22:37.357 --> 22:38.789
between attorney
and client,

22:38.791 --> 22:41.525
including payment practices,
are confidential.

22:41.527 --> 22:45.062
James Vogel--
did he pay you in cash, too?

22:45.064 --> 22:47.031
BOWMAN:
Sorry--

22:47.033 --> 22:48.966
privileged.

22:48.968 --> 22:51.402
Only if payments
were for legal fees.

22:51.404 --> 22:53.604
Why the hell else
would he pay me?

22:53.606 --> 22:55.973
Blackmail comes to mind.

22:55.975 --> 22:59.410
You obviously don't have
enough evidence to arrest me,

22:59.412 --> 23:03.581
which means you don't have
enough to insult me either.

23:04.917 --> 23:06.083
Carla.

23:16.863 --> 23:18.462
He's right, you know.

23:18.464 --> 23:20.431
We can't tie him
to anything.

23:20.433 --> 23:21.532
Ditto on Dwyer.

23:21.534 --> 23:23.100
Somebody gave
Vogel's letters

23:23.102 --> 23:24.969
to<i> Out Word</i> magazine.

23:24.971 --> 23:27.405
That's fair to cloudy.

23:27.406 --> 23:29.840
The editor's on a high horse
called the First Amendment.

23:29.842 --> 23:31.075
His mouth is shut.

23:31.077 --> 23:33.411
25 years might convince him
to reconsider.

23:33.413 --> 23:35.446
You think he's involved
in the murder?

23:35.448 --> 23:39.183
No. But he doesn't know that.

23:39.185 --> 23:41.185
STONE:
<i> We're not asking you</i>

23:41.187 --> 23:43.421
not to publish,
Mr. Barclay--

23:43.423 --> 23:45.423
just the sources
of your material.

23:45.425 --> 23:46.957
I don't see the difference.

23:46.959 --> 23:49.427
No protection of sources
equals no free press.

23:49.429 --> 23:52.863
The Supreme Court...
ROBINETTE:
Has never said that.

23:52.865 --> 23:54.432
STONE:
And I doubt

23:54.434 --> 23:57.134
if the present court ever will.

23:57.136 --> 23:59.103
I'm not merely asserting
<i> my</i> rights.

23:59.105 --> 24:01.572
Freedom of the press
is the public's right.

24:01.574 --> 24:04.475
If sources were fair game,
Anita Hill would still be

24:04.477 --> 24:06.510
some unknown professor
in Oklahoma.

24:06.512 --> 24:08.879
You're looking
at jail time, Mr. Barclay.

24:08.881 --> 24:10.181
For contempt-- fine.

24:10.183 --> 24:11.715
I'll make that sacrifice.

24:11.717 --> 24:13.617
STONE:
Not for contempt, sir.

24:13.619 --> 24:16.487
For conspiracy
to commit blackmail and murder.

24:16.489 --> 24:18.889
(<i> chuckles</i> ):
You have got to be kidding!

24:18.891 --> 24:19.890
I'm sorry, sir.

24:19.892 --> 24:21.892
I lost my
sense of humor

24:21.894 --> 24:25.162
when I saw the photographs
of James Vogel.

24:25.164 --> 24:27.198
I had nothing to do with that.

24:27.200 --> 24:28.732
ROBINETTE:
Letters you had

24:28.734 --> 24:31.001
were used
to blackmail Mr. Vogel.

24:31.003 --> 24:33.104
STONE:
At a minimum,

24:33.105 --> 24:35.206
you're withholding evidence
to a murder investigation.

24:35.208 --> 24:37.942
At maximum, you're part
of the conspiracy.

24:37.944 --> 24:40.244
Principles go a long way,
Mr. Barclay,

24:40.246 --> 24:44.048
but if I were you,
I'd ask myself, are they worth

24:44.050 --> 24:46.550
25 years
in prison?

24:56.162 --> 25:01.165
The letters showed up
on my desk, anonymously.

25:01.167 --> 25:02.967
And you didn't verify them?

25:02.969 --> 25:05.035
I'm not about to get sued.

25:05.037 --> 25:07.204
Experts compared
Vogel's handwriting.

25:07.206 --> 25:08.506
I want them.

25:08.508 --> 25:09.640
Do I have a choice?

25:09.642 --> 25:12.109
If you want
to avoid an indictment,

25:12.111 --> 25:13.177
no, you don't.

25:13.179 --> 25:14.645
SCHIFF:
How bad?

25:14.647 --> 25:17.581
Bad enough
to not want them published.

25:17.583 --> 25:19.049
All written by Vogel?

25:19.051 --> 25:21.285
ROBINETTE:
Mailed to Dwyer
in Ossining.

25:21.287 --> 25:24.555
Dwyer's the point man,
he gave the letters to Colson

25:24.557 --> 25:26.557
who then handled the blackmail.

25:26.559 --> 25:28.125
What about
the murder?

25:28.127 --> 25:30.661
Maybe Vogel got tired
of paying him,

25:30.663 --> 25:32.596
threatened
to turn him in.

25:32.598 --> 25:33.797
Blackmail is thin.

25:33.799 --> 25:34.798
Murder...

25:34.800 --> 25:36.267
The letters to Dwyer.

25:36.269 --> 25:38.302
Cash payments
to Dwyer's attorney.

25:38.304 --> 25:41.772
Still, unless one of the people
making those payments talks,

25:41.774 --> 25:43.774
it all adds up to nothing.

25:43.776 --> 25:45.242
His father, Ed Vogel,

25:45.244 --> 25:47.311
was the first one who asked

25:47.313 --> 25:49.213
that I run for this office.

25:49.215 --> 25:52.683
There was a time when a nod
from him carried weight.

25:52.685 --> 25:54.285
Get<i> someone</i> to testify.

26:00.560 --> 26:03.060
HARRIS:
I already told
the police

26:03.062 --> 26:05.095
I paid a legal bill
in cash.

26:05.097 --> 26:06.230
What's the big deal?

26:06.232 --> 26:09.567
STONE:
No big deal if it
were just once.

26:09.569 --> 26:12.202
The courier says
you send packages

26:12.204 --> 26:14.104
to Mr. Colson
every other week.

26:14.106 --> 26:17.641
Uh, we spoke to Harold Dwyer,
Mr. Harris.

26:27.587 --> 26:32.089
I was in pro ball
close to 11 years--

26:32.091 --> 26:36.060
nine of them in the bigs.

26:36.062 --> 26:39.697
This company hired me
for a reason.

26:39.699 --> 26:41.365
They bought an image.

26:43.603 --> 26:45.336
See...

26:47.206 --> 26:50.674
I was not a Bobby Bonilla,
Mr. Stone.

26:50.676 --> 26:53.711
I need this job.

26:53.713 --> 26:56.280
STONE:
You paid Mr. Dwyer

26:56.282 --> 26:58.882
and Mr. Colson
to keep your secret?

26:58.884 --> 27:02.620
I paid them to keep my life.

27:02.622 --> 27:05.155
I have two sons.

27:05.157 --> 27:07.291
Every year they come with me

27:07.293 --> 27:10.828
to the Cubs
Alumni Day.

27:10.830 --> 27:12.329
How much you pay them?

27:14.233 --> 27:17.301
It was supposed to stop
at $50,000.

27:17.303 --> 27:19.303
Colson came back for more?

27:19.305 --> 27:21.338
Colson I never heard of.

27:21.340 --> 27:24.241
It was just
a voice on the phone.

27:24.243 --> 27:27.177
Said that it
would cost me another 25.

27:27.179 --> 27:30.648
Would you recognize that voice?

27:30.650 --> 27:32.316
Well, there's no need.

27:32.318 --> 27:35.285
I... I, uh, taped the call,
you know,

27:35.287 --> 27:38.255
just in case
anything happened.

27:39.792 --> 27:43.761
There's no way I'm going
to say any of this in public.

27:43.763 --> 27:46.263
We<i> can</i> subpoena you, sir.

27:46.265 --> 27:50.734
I'd rather go to jail,
Mr. Stone.

27:54.774 --> 27:57.207
STONE:
Your son was not
the only victim

27:57.209 --> 27:58.809
of this blackmail
scheme, Mr. Vogel.

27:58.811 --> 28:00.210
We've located
one other.

28:00.212 --> 28:03.113
And he'll testify?

28:03.115 --> 28:05.249
He's paid Colson
a lot of money.

28:05.251 --> 28:06.350
He doesn't plan

28:06.352 --> 28:07.818
on going public now.

28:07.820 --> 28:09.987
In other words,

28:09.988 --> 28:12.155
without this witness,
you can't go to trial.

28:12.158 --> 28:14.258
I'm sorry.

28:16.362 --> 28:19.830
What if we close the courtroom,
no press, no cameras?

28:19.832 --> 28:22.433
Assure him his identity
will remain a secret?

28:22.435 --> 28:24.201
Can you get a judge

28:24.203 --> 28:25.803
to agree to that?

28:25.805 --> 28:27.938
Well, typically, no,
but this witness<i> was</i>

28:27.940 --> 28:30.207
a part of the same
blackmail scheme,

28:30.209 --> 28:32.242
and given what happened
to your son...

28:32.244 --> 28:34.812
We can certainly argue
his life's in danger.

28:34.814 --> 28:36.246
Have Colson
and Dwyer arrested.

28:36.248 --> 28:39.817
Let's hope we draw
a sympathetic judge.

28:39.819 --> 28:42.252
<i> Docket number 59422.</i>

28:42.254 --> 28:44.188
<i> People v. Peter Colson</i>
<i> and Harold Dwyer.</i>

28:44.190 --> 28:46.356
One count each--
murder in the second degree.

28:46.358 --> 28:49.493
One count each-- grand larceny
in the second degree.

28:53.733 --> 28:55.432
Parties ready to plead?

28:55.434 --> 28:57.801
Not guilty,
Your Honor.

28:57.803 --> 28:58.969
Not guilty.

28:58.971 --> 29:01.505
Mr. Robinette?
Recommendation on bail,

29:01.507 --> 29:03.307
$500,000 on each.

29:03.309 --> 29:05.175
It's excessive,
Your Honor.

29:05.177 --> 29:06.877
In this economy, Your Honor,

29:06.879 --> 29:09.780
the state might as well
ask for a million.

29:09.782 --> 29:11.982
We can't raise
that kind of cash.

29:11.984 --> 29:13.817
This is America, Counselor.

29:13.819 --> 29:14.885
Borrow.

29:14.887 --> 29:17.855
Bail is set at $300,000 each.

29:20.760 --> 29:21.892
Tomorrow at 2:30.

29:21.894 --> 29:23.327
Preliminary conference.

29:23.329 --> 29:25.295
Judge Strelzik's chambers.

29:25.297 --> 29:26.363
Closed courtroom?

29:26.365 --> 29:28.365
You've got
to be kidding, Paul.

29:28.367 --> 29:30.501
I just got my hair done.

29:33.305 --> 29:36.874
<i> Keep the reporters out</i>
<i> of the courtroom?</i>

29:36.876 --> 29:38.308
Fine. I don't care.

29:38.310 --> 29:41.411
But withholding the name
of a witness is absurd.

29:41.413 --> 29:44.014
Not when there's a risk
of retaliation.

29:44.016 --> 29:46.283
One man is already dead,
Your Honor.

29:46.285 --> 29:49.319
How can I prepare
a proper cross-examination

29:49.321 --> 29:52.256
when I don't know anything
about the witness?

29:52.258 --> 29:55.793
Tomorrow morning, 10:30,
in my chambers

29:55.795 --> 29:59.029
I want to hear
what this witness has to say.

29:59.031 --> 30:00.898
HARRIS:
<i> No way, Mr. Stone.</i>

30:00.900 --> 30:03.467
You told me complete anonymity.

30:03.469 --> 30:06.303
Judge Strelzik has
to know who you are.

30:06.305 --> 30:07.805
There's no way
around that.

30:07.807 --> 30:10.040
The judge
we're not worried about.

30:10.042 --> 30:11.809
It's Colson's lawyer.

30:11.811 --> 30:13.277
She'll be there, right?

30:13.279 --> 30:15.245
So what's to prevent her

30:15.247 --> 30:17.080
from revealing
George's identity?

30:17.082 --> 30:19.383
STONE:
With a gag order,
for one.

30:19.385 --> 30:20.918
You'll be a John Doe.

30:20.920 --> 30:23.086
Do you want
to go on paying

30:23.088 --> 30:27.090
for the rest of your life,
Mr. Harris?

30:27.092 --> 30:30.260
I answered an ad
in a magazine--

30:30.262 --> 30:33.463
"Prisoner lonely,
please write."

30:33.465 --> 30:36.300
was Mr. Dwyer?
And that

30:36.302 --> 30:38.452
Yes. Um...

30:38.453 --> 30:40.603
at first, it was just
a friendly correspondence

30:40.606 --> 30:43.073
you know, about sports
and current events

30:43.075 --> 30:45.275
and that sort of thing.

30:45.277 --> 30:47.377
What happened then?

30:47.379 --> 30:52.282
He, um, wanted me
to get...

30:52.284 --> 30:53.851
more graphic.

30:53.853 --> 30:56.353
And did you?

30:56.355 --> 30:59.323
Yes. He was a prisoner.

30:59.325 --> 31:02.059
I felt sorry for him.

31:02.061 --> 31:03.527
But it was all a con.

31:03.529 --> 31:05.596
After about
a half dozen letters,

31:05.598 --> 31:08.465
they started asking
me for money--

31:08.467 --> 31:11.001
$50,000 over
five months.

31:11.003 --> 31:13.036
And then they wanted more.

31:13.038 --> 31:15.472
I have it recorded on tape.

31:15.474 --> 31:17.374
Is this the tape?

31:17.376 --> 31:19.509
Yes.

31:19.511 --> 31:21.044
BOWMAN:
Sir,

31:21.046 --> 31:23.413
did the persons blackmailing you

31:23.415 --> 31:26.383
ever threaten you
with physical harm?

31:26.385 --> 31:27.584
No, no.

31:27.586 --> 31:30.053
And the person
who contacted you

31:30.055 --> 31:32.956
for money-- did he have a name?

31:34.894 --> 31:37.027
He never used it.

31:37.029 --> 31:39.062
So you were
just assuming

31:39.064 --> 31:40.430
it was Peter Colson.

31:40.432 --> 31:42.883
STONE:
The only issue

31:42.884 --> 31:45.335
relevant to this hearing
is whether the witness

31:45.337 --> 31:46.970
is in physical danger.

31:46.972 --> 31:48.639
BOWMAN:
He just said he wasn't

31:48.641 --> 31:49.907
even threatened.

31:49.909 --> 31:51.408
In any case, this witness

31:51.410 --> 31:52.643
has given no evidence

31:52.645 --> 31:54.111
concerning
my client.

31:54.113 --> 31:55.379
The voice

31:55.381 --> 31:58.181
on this tape
is clearly identifiable.

31:58.183 --> 31:59.917
Fine. Let's hear it.

31:59.919 --> 32:01.985
That is enough
to give him away,

32:01.987 --> 32:03.387
put him in jeopardy.

32:03.389 --> 32:04.988
Is his name mentioned?

32:04.990 --> 32:08.058
No, but your client
could easily recall

32:08.060 --> 32:09.059
the conversation.

32:09.061 --> 32:10.527
For God sakes, Ben.

32:10.529 --> 32:13.931
Peter Colson is an upstanding
member of the bar--

32:13.933 --> 32:14.998
not an animal.

32:15.000 --> 32:16.433
Someone killed James Vogel,

32:16.435 --> 32:19.369
and I'm not letting
it happen to another life.

32:19.371 --> 32:22.105
I'll listen to the tape alone.

32:24.143 --> 32:27.444
You'll have my decision
tomorrow morning.

32:27.446 --> 32:28.946
Closing a courtroom--

32:28.948 --> 32:31.014
congratulations--
minor miracle.

32:31.016 --> 32:33.050
It's hardly a burning bush.

32:33.052 --> 32:36.053
Colson's lawyer didn't
put up much of a fight.

32:36.055 --> 32:37.621
I guess she didn't want

32:37.623 --> 32:40.490
the press feasting
on his reputation.

32:40.492 --> 32:42.492
Lawyers get together and toss

32:42.494 --> 32:46.964
the First Amendment's right
to free press down the toilet.

32:46.966 --> 32:48.632
Maybe it's the best way
to protect

32:48.634 --> 32:50.667
the Sixth Amendment's
right to a fair trial.

32:50.669 --> 32:53.670
With Harris on the stand,
we get extortion.

32:53.672 --> 32:55.138
<i> If</i> harris
takes the stand.

32:55.140 --> 32:57.641
This just landed
on my desk.

32:57.643 --> 33:00.110
A writ of prohibition?

33:00.112 --> 33:03.113
Barclay, the editor
of<i> Out Word</i> magazine--

33:03.115 --> 33:05.482
he's challenging
the closed courtroom

33:05.484 --> 33:07.050
on behalf of the media.

33:07.052 --> 33:09.486
How much con law
do you remember?

33:09.488 --> 33:10.554
Not enough.

33:10.556 --> 33:12.990
A 50-page brief
written in support

33:12.992 --> 33:15.225
by Helen Murphy,
Esquire.

33:15.227 --> 33:17.527
The First Lady
of First Amendment law?

33:17.529 --> 33:21.164
Barclay's got to have
some deep pockets.

33:22.201 --> 33:25.002
<i> The right to a public trial</i>
<i> is guaranteed</i>

33:25.004 --> 33:27.170
by both the Sixth
and the 14th Amendments.

33:27.172 --> 33:29.606
This is a balancing
test-- that right

33:29.608 --> 33:31.742
weighed against
the potential harm

33:31.744 --> 33:33.443
to this
particular witness.

33:33.445 --> 33:36.246
MURPHY:
<i>And</i> the people's
right to know.

33:36.248 --> 33:37.781
Does the first amendment

33:37.783 --> 33:40.550
suddenly not exist, Mr. Stone?

33:40.552 --> 33:42.152
This urgency
to inform the public

33:42.154 --> 33:44.688
as to the facts
of this particular case

33:44.690 --> 33:47.157
cannot outweigh the rights...

33:47.159 --> 33:50.560
Of one overly paranoid witness?
Please.

33:50.562 --> 33:53.163
A real person's life
is in jeopardy.

33:53.165 --> 33:55.699
Surely that outweighs
any intangible benefits

33:55.701 --> 33:57.167
to a general public

33:57.169 --> 33:59.102
not affected by this case.

33:59.104 --> 34:01.038
So we rewrite
the First Amendment--

34:01.040 --> 34:04.241
freedom of the press only
when it affects the majority?

34:04.243 --> 34:05.242
Your Honor...

34:05.244 --> 34:07.144
We are not asking

34:07.146 --> 34:10.680
that the 11:00 news be allowed
to wheel in a camera crew.

34:10.682 --> 34:12.115
Why the hell not?

34:12.117 --> 34:16.053
I empathize
with your witness, Mr. Stone,

34:16.055 --> 34:19.623
but there's a heavy
burden you must meet

34:19.625 --> 34:21.625
to deprive
the voyeuristic public

34:21.627 --> 34:25.162
of their right to peek in
on the woes of others.

34:25.164 --> 34:28.265
Now, if your witness
is in that much danger,

34:28.267 --> 34:30.267
don't put him on the stand.

34:30.269 --> 34:33.136
I'm sorry,
Counselor, but...

34:33.138 --> 34:36.506
freedom abhors
secret proceedings.

34:36.508 --> 34:39.209
Your client may quote me

34:39.211 --> 34:40.744
on that, Ms. Murphy.

34:40.746 --> 34:42.179
Petitioner's motion

34:42.181 --> 34:43.180
is granted.

34:43.182 --> 34:44.815
The trial will be open

34:44.817 --> 34:46.683
to the press.

34:49.822 --> 34:51.354
I tried, Ben.

34:51.356 --> 34:52.789
I really did.

34:52.791 --> 34:55.559
But George will not
testify in open court.

34:55.561 --> 34:57.727
I can't win without him.

34:57.729 --> 35:00.664
He wants to see
Colson walk?

35:00.666 --> 35:03.667
No, but he's entitled
to be a little selfish.

35:03.669 --> 35:06.403
And I don't know
if I blame him.

35:06.405 --> 35:07.804
What about the tape?

35:07.806 --> 35:11.374
Offer that into evidence
without his testimony.

35:11.376 --> 35:13.477
Without authentication
it's worthless.

35:13.479 --> 35:14.578
He did give

35:14.580 --> 35:16.746
a sworn statement
in judge's chambers.

35:16.748 --> 35:18.715
And he was cross-examined

35:18.717 --> 35:21.551
by opposing counsel, but...

35:21.553 --> 35:24.321
BREWER:
Transcripts never
mentioned his name.

35:24.323 --> 35:25.655
Are they admissible?

35:25.657 --> 35:27.591
C.P.L. section 6-70-10.

35:27.593 --> 35:30.560
"Testimony given pursuant
to a conditional examination

35:30.562 --> 35:32.596
"is admissible
when the witness

35:32.598 --> 35:35.398
"is unable
to attend the trial

35:35.400 --> 35:38.135
"because of death, illness,
incapacity, or is outside

35:38.137 --> 35:40.570
"the state and cannot
with due diligence be brought

35:40.572 --> 35:44.541
before the court."
Interesting.

35:44.543 --> 35:45.775
This is outrageous!

35:45.777 --> 35:48.445
It's unethical,
not to mention prejudicial!

35:48.447 --> 35:49.679
Screaming doesn't make it

35:49.681 --> 35:51.548
inadmissible.

35:51.549 --> 35:53.416
We subpoenaed the witness
to testify,

35:53.418 --> 35:55.585
but it seems he's relocated.

35:55.587 --> 35:56.553
Address unknown.

35:56.555 --> 35:58.455
His attorney suspects

35:58.457 --> 35:59.723
he's gone out of state.

35:59.725 --> 36:01.424
And I suspect

36:01.426 --> 36:03.793
we got major league manipulation
going on.

36:03.795 --> 36:06.696
JUDGE STRELZIK:
You're free to appeal.

36:06.698 --> 36:10.534
The requirements of C.P.L. 6-70
have been satisfied.

36:10.536 --> 36:12.702
The witnesses
prior sworn testimony

36:12.704 --> 36:15.672
can be read into evidence.

36:15.674 --> 36:19.376
HARRIS (<i> on tape</i> ):
<i>I've already given you $50,000.</i>

36:19.378 --> 36:21.645
I don't really give a damn.
COLSON:

36:21.647 --> 36:24.681
or that closet door
It's another 25,

36:24.683 --> 36:26.583
swings wide open, my friend.

36:26.585 --> 36:27.918
The messenger will be there

36:27.920 --> 36:29.719
tomorrow at 5:00.

36:31.590 --> 36:35.592
First of all, you've got
to get a jury to buy it.

36:35.594 --> 36:37.594
After the judge instructs them

36:37.596 --> 36:40.463
about the weight
this evidence should be given.

36:40.465 --> 36:43.667
Your client will be convicted
of larceny by extortion.

36:43.669 --> 36:45.969
It won't take
a major leap of faith

36:45.971 --> 36:47.971
to construct
a convincing argument

36:47.973 --> 36:51.408
for murder two.
You're dreaming.

36:51.410 --> 36:52.909
If you want something enough

36:52.911 --> 36:55.545
dreams have a way
of coming true.

36:55.547 --> 36:57.614
Want to take that chance,
Counselor?

36:57.616 --> 36:58.882
What are you offering?

36:58.884 --> 37:01.618
about the murder
If he didn't know

37:01.620 --> 37:04.888
and he gives us Dwyer,
grand larceny three.

37:09.528 --> 37:10.727
It was all Dwyer.

37:10.729 --> 37:12.996
I never wanted
to kill the guy.

37:12.998 --> 37:14.965
You were part
of the blackmail?

37:14.967 --> 37:16.700
Dwyer's brainstorming.

37:16.702 --> 37:18.902
I was desperate.

37:18.904 --> 37:21.671
The economy went south,
my business went with it.

37:21.673 --> 37:24.608
I was in a hole--
mortgaage, child support.

37:24.610 --> 37:26.509
How much
did you collect?

37:26.511 --> 37:27.711
Fifty grand each.

37:27.713 --> 37:29.746
You and Dwyer

37:29.748 --> 37:31.481
would split it?

37:31.483 --> 37:33.917
My ex moved for
an upward modification

37:33.919 --> 37:35.919
of our settlement agreement.

37:35.921 --> 37:37.654
I needed cash.

37:37.656 --> 37:40.523
I didn't expect Dwyer's release
until September.

37:40.525 --> 37:42.659
I came up short.

37:42.661 --> 37:44.594
You went back to Vogel for more?

37:44.596 --> 37:46.763
But he wasn't buying.

37:46.765 --> 37:48.498
He had enough.

37:48.500 --> 37:49.799
Dwyer took care of him.

37:49.801 --> 37:51.718
You're still
an accomplice.

37:51.719 --> 37:53.636
I need more than<i> your</i> testimony
to convict.

37:53.639 --> 37:55.505
You want corroboration?

37:55.507 --> 37:57.674
You talk to the old man.

37:57.676 --> 37:58.908
What?

37:58.910 --> 38:01.011
Dwyer made a house call.

38:01.013 --> 38:04.447
He talked to Edward Vogel?

38:04.449 --> 38:06.616
Daddy paid the bill directly.

38:06.618 --> 38:08.852
That's when junior
went ballistic

38:08.854 --> 38:10.854
and said he'd turn us in.

38:10.856 --> 38:12.756
Next thing I knew

38:12.758 --> 38:15.759
I was reading about it
in the<i> Post.</i>

38:17.562 --> 38:20.030
That son of a bitch.

38:20.032 --> 38:21.698
And you
believed him?

38:21.700 --> 38:23.566
Any reason
i shouldn't?

38:23.568 --> 38:25.602
He's admitted to
blackmail, for one.

38:25.604 --> 38:27.604
your bank records.
We've checked

38:27.606 --> 38:29.706
You made
a large withdrawal

38:29.708 --> 38:31.708
the day before
Jim was killed.

38:31.710 --> 38:32.709
You knew all along.

38:32.711 --> 38:33.910
With your testimony

38:33.912 --> 38:36.646
we could have gone to trial
three weeks ago.

38:36.648 --> 38:37.947
Watch your tone, sir.

38:37.949 --> 38:40.583
I pick up the phone

38:40.585 --> 38:42.485
and your license
to be holier

38:42.487 --> 38:44.087
than everybody else
on this planet

38:44.089 --> 38:46.756
can be used to wallpaper
the sewer.

38:49.995 --> 38:51.761
Your son is dead, sir.

38:51.763 --> 38:53.730
You're protecting his killers.

38:53.732 --> 38:55.765
That's my business,
Mr. Stone,

38:55.767 --> 38:59.035
and I intend
to keep it that way.

39:03.608 --> 39:05.675
Good day, gentlemen.

39:06.712 --> 39:09.879
The bastard's done everything
he can to stop us.

39:09.881 --> 39:12.115
It's his son.

39:12.117 --> 39:14.050
I can't believe...

39:14.052 --> 39:15.852
He paid Murphy's legal fees.

39:15.854 --> 39:17.520
To open up
a courtroom?

39:17.522 --> 39:18.688
Doesn't make sense.

39:18.690 --> 39:19.989
Think it through.

39:19.991 --> 39:22.308
With the press in the courtroom,

39:22.309 --> 39:24.626
there's no way
George Harris testifies.
Without his testimony,

39:24.629 --> 39:26.696
we can't go to trial.

39:26.697 --> 39:28.764
No one ever knows
that the boy was gay.

39:28.767 --> 39:30.800
He'd rather see Dwyer
and Colson go free

39:30.802 --> 39:34.604
than tarnish his good name.
Sure,
political necessity.

39:34.606 --> 39:37.040
You don't survive
as long as he did

39:37.042 --> 39:38.775
without keeping
your hamper closed.

39:38.777 --> 39:40.810
It's about to open up.

39:40.812 --> 39:42.379
I served him

39:42.381 --> 39:43.847
with a subpoena.

39:43.849 --> 39:48.651
Ah, that explains
why he's got a call into me.

39:48.653 --> 39:50.787
A subpoena?

39:50.789 --> 39:53.123
Really, Adam.

39:53.125 --> 39:55.091
Without
your testimony

39:55.093 --> 39:57.827
the murder case disappears.

39:57.829 --> 40:01.798
I'm familiar with
how city business is conducted.

40:01.800 --> 40:03.700
You're probably
also aware

40:03.702 --> 40:09.706
that my office doesn't service
anyone's personal agenda.

40:09.708 --> 40:12.409
Not anyone's?

40:12.411 --> 40:16.813
16 Years ago, I pulled
your name out of a hat.

40:16.815 --> 40:19.682
Save the backroom marker crap;
it's too late for that.

40:19.684 --> 40:22.852
What you did had nothing to do
with my getting this office

40:22.854 --> 40:24.821
or with my keeping it.

40:24.823 --> 40:26.956
Fine.

40:26.958 --> 40:30.427
A favor, then, for a friend.

40:30.429 --> 40:32.662
Call off the dogs.

40:38.437 --> 40:41.604
I keep this picture of Jim
on my desk.

40:41.606 --> 40:43.006
Graduation day, Columbia.

40:43.008 --> 40:46.643
He's standing there
with his arms around his mother.

40:46.645 --> 40:51.448
Damn it, Adam, he looks
just like everybody else.

40:51.450 --> 40:53.850
I've spent my life
protecting him.

40:53.852 --> 40:56.453
From what?

40:56.455 --> 41:01.624
Your shame put the knife
into Dwyer's hand,

41:01.626 --> 41:02.959
and there's no way

41:02.961 --> 41:06.796
I'm going to let that
keep him out of jail.

41:07.899 --> 41:10.867
I've known you for 25 years, Ed,

41:10.869 --> 41:14.938
and I'm telling you now,
you don't testify tomorrow,

41:14.940 --> 41:18.074
you're going to go to jail
for contempt.

41:20.979 --> 41:24.747
<i>Mr. Vogel, when did you first</i>
<i> make contact</i>

41:24.749 --> 41:27.684
with the defendant Harold Dwyer?

41:36.862 --> 41:40.697
Permission to treat this witness
as hostile, Your Honor?

41:40.699 --> 41:43.766
Go ahead, Mr. Stone.

41:43.768 --> 41:46.069
Isn't it true
that your son

41:46.071 --> 41:48.238
borrowed $50,000 from you?

41:55.046 --> 41:58.114
I can enter the bank statements
as evidence...

41:58.116 --> 41:59.916
Yes, he was my son.

41:59.918 --> 42:01.217
I lent him money.

42:01.219 --> 42:03.253
Did he say what it was for?

42:03.255 --> 42:05.288
ridiculous.
This is

42:05.290 --> 42:09.526
Your Honor, this witness
has nothing to offer.

42:09.528 --> 42:12.729
We can hold you
in contempt, sir.

42:21.206 --> 42:24.274
Did you love your son,
Mr. Vogel?

42:27.779 --> 42:29.746
Yes.

42:31.216 --> 42:33.216
Very much.

42:33.218 --> 42:35.785
You proud of him?

42:37.222 --> 42:40.123
Jimmy could have been mayor.

42:41.893 --> 42:45.128
He was smart
and everybody liked him.

42:47.299 --> 42:52.168
I thought it would be best
if we kept it all quiet.

42:52.170 --> 42:54.771
Quiet about what?

42:58.810 --> 43:01.077
That he was gay.

43:03.915 --> 43:06.916
I would have paid any amount.

43:06.918 --> 43:09.819
At first,
Jimmy went along with it.

43:09.821 --> 43:12.088
He wanted me to be proud.

43:19.264 --> 43:22.298
I mean...

43:22.300 --> 43:25.768
he didn't want me
to be embarr...

43:25.770 --> 43:27.837
embarrassed.

43:30.241 --> 43:32.141
After all the...

43:32.143 --> 43:34.143
(<i> clearing throat</i> )

43:34.145 --> 43:36.145
after all the years of pain

43:36.147 --> 43:38.214
he didn't care anymore.

43:38.216 --> 43:42.051
He told me it was his life,
not mine.

43:42.053 --> 43:46.990
They asked him for more money
and Jimmy refused.

43:48.059 --> 43:50.293
And then what happened?

43:52.163 --> 43:55.331
The defendant, Mr. Dwyer,
came to me.

43:56.301 --> 44:00.336
50 Grand
or it's all over the news.

44:00.338 --> 44:02.372
And you paid him?

44:05.176 --> 44:08.177
Yes... yes.

44:08.179 --> 44:11.214
How did your son
react to that?

44:11.216 --> 44:13.650
He was angry.

44:13.652 --> 44:17.020
He called
Mr. Dwyer

44:17.022 --> 44:18.321
from my office

44:18.323 --> 44:21.190
and said he'd go to the police

44:21.192 --> 44:24.193
if Dwyer
didn't return the money.

44:24.195 --> 44:27.363
Well, then what did
Mr. Dwyer do?

44:27.365 --> 44:30.433
He said he'd been in jail
for six years

44:30.435 --> 44:32.235
and there was no way

44:32.237 --> 44:34.237
he was going back.

44:38.143 --> 44:41.010
The next day, they found Jimmy.

44:56.294 --> 44:59.028
Will the defendant please rise?

45:04.269 --> 45:07.170
On the first count
of the indictment

45:07.172 --> 45:09.305
grand larceny
in the second degree

45:09.307 --> 45:12.341
how do you find?

45:12.343 --> 45:15.344
We find the defendant guilty.

45:15.346 --> 45:18.181
On the second count
of the indictment

45:18.183 --> 45:21.317
murder in the second degree,
how do you find?

45:21.319 --> 45:24.187
We find the defendant guilty.

45:41.239 --> 45:45.174
Deep down, Ed Vogel truly
believes he loved his son.

45:45.176 --> 45:46.909
You don't think
he did.

45:46.911 --> 45:48.277
Acceptance before love,
right?

45:48.279 --> 45:51.914
A son is not merely an extension
of his father's ego.

45:51.916 --> 45:53.216
That's a law
of nature.

45:53.218 --> 45:56.219
Sons go to extremes
to please their fathers.

45:56.221 --> 45:58.755
My father wanted me
to be a doctor.

45:58.757 --> 46:01.758
I went so far as
to study organic chemistry.

46:01.760 --> 46:03.159
What happened?

46:03.161 --> 46:04.527
I grew up.
