00:24.840 --> 00:25.880
I told them.

00:27.920 --> 00:30.520
I said all along
there was a second chamber.

00:33.480 --> 00:35.350
You know what this means?

00:35.400 --> 00:39.360
The name of Beresford
will become the stuff of legend.

00:55.440 --> 00:56.680
Who is he?

01:02.440 --> 01:04.879
"Princely... High Priest.

01:06.160 --> 01:08.230
"Powerful of strength.

01:08.280 --> 01:10.160
"Sacred of appearance.

01:13.240 --> 01:14.440
"Amenhotep."

01:21.000 --> 01:25.280
"He who disturbs
the appointed of the Gods...

01:26.440 --> 01:27.920
".. shall suffer their wrath."

01:51.640 --> 01:56.400
How... beautiful he is.

02:37.560 --> 02:39.110
Thank you for this, Mr Hubble.

02:39.160 --> 02:42.470
Such invaluable research
for my latest novel.

02:42.520 --> 02:45.070
My pleasure, Lady Felicia.

02:45.120 --> 02:48.750
The Beresford collection
is the only private museum

02:48.800 --> 02:52.910
to own a complete set of
12th dynasty embalming tools.

02:52.960 --> 02:54.790
Did Father Brown tell you
the name of it?

02:54.840 --> 02:56.750
It's entitled Love In The Dunes -

02:56.800 --> 02:59.310
The Adventures Of A Flame-Haired
Beauty.

02:59.360 --> 03:01.230
What's this?

03:01.280 --> 03:04.230
Some kind of crochet needle?

03:04.280 --> 03:05.630
A brain hook.

03:05.680 --> 03:07.670
Inserted through the nostril
to smash the brain

03:07.720 --> 03:10.910
and extract it through the nose,
during the embalming process.

03:10.960 --> 03:14.680
I don't know what's wrong with a
good, hygienic, Christian burial.

03:18.440 --> 03:20.110
What's down here?

03:20.160 --> 03:21.230
Oh, erm...

03:21.280 --> 03:23.960
Sir Raleigh's private collection.

03:25.600 --> 03:27.310
Now, over here,

03:27.360 --> 03:31.200
we have some particularly fine
examples of new kingdom scarabs.

03:39.680 --> 03:41.190
Are you limping, Father?

03:41.240 --> 03:42.790
Old war wound.

03:42.840 --> 03:45.750
Nothing camphor oil won't fix.

03:45.800 --> 03:46.790
Gout.

03:46.840 --> 03:48.470
Shrapnel!

03:48.520 --> 03:50.390
That's what the doctor said, was it?

03:50.440 --> 03:53.630
At the appointment
I made for you this morning?

03:55.040 --> 03:56.710
~ Bless you. 
~ It's pollen.

03:56.760 --> 03:58.950
He's a martyr to hay fever.

03:59.000 --> 04:03.430
Oh, I picked up your eye drops
at the surgery.

04:03.480 --> 04:04.520
Thank you.

04:06.560 --> 04:10.630
When are you going to put
that poor man out of his misery?

04:10.680 --> 04:12.710
Walter and I are good friends,
but...

04:12.760 --> 04:15.430
At a certain time in life,
isn't that enough?

04:15.480 --> 04:16.880
He'd want us to leave here.

04:20.760 --> 04:22.070
Did you know about this?

04:22.120 --> 04:25.070
When did Raleigh deign
to inform me of his movements?

04:25.120 --> 04:29.350
He and his son Leo are supposed to
be in America on a lecture tour.

04:29.400 --> 04:30.920
Valeri-i-i-ie!

04:34.920 --> 04:36.200
Valeri-i-ie!

04:41.240 --> 04:43.120
Valeri-i-ie!

04:48.440 --> 04:50.510
Hello, Raleigh.

04:50.560 --> 04:51.630
Isn't Leo with you?

04:51.680 --> 04:53.070
Oh, he's following on behind.

04:53.120 --> 04:54.390
Where the hell is everyone?

04:54.440 --> 04:55.750
The staff were given leave.

04:55.800 --> 04:57.870
Some notice would have
been appreciated.

04:57.920 --> 04:59.790
Change of plan.

04:59.840 --> 05:01.150
Who the hell are you?

05:01.200 --> 05:03.510
Hello, Raleigh.

05:03.560 --> 05:04.670
I hope you don't mind.

05:04.720 --> 05:07.110
Mr Hubble has been giving us a
tour of your museum.

05:07.160 --> 05:10.790
Felicia Windemere! Oh, ho, ho, ho!

05:10.840 --> 05:12.550
You haven't changed a bit.

05:12.600 --> 05:13.840
Neither have you!

05:14.960 --> 05:16.870
As beautiful as ever.
You'll stay for lunch.

05:16.920 --> 05:18.990
I'm afraid we couldn't
possibly intrude.

05:19.040 --> 05:21.350
Lay extra places. It's a celebration.

05:22.680 --> 05:24.080
And here she is.

05:27.840 --> 05:29.830
My love, let me introduce you.

05:29.880 --> 05:32.390
No! I want to guess.

05:32.440 --> 05:33.600
Let me see.

05:34.640 --> 05:36.670
I think that is Hubble.

05:36.720 --> 05:38.150
Very good!

05:38.200 --> 05:40.830
Miss Oliphant,
the faithful secretary.

05:40.880 --> 05:42.960
And you must be Raleigh's daughter.

05:44.720 --> 05:46.030
Tell them.

05:46.080 --> 05:48.110
This is Caterina...

05:48.160 --> 05:49.200
My wife.

05:51.400 --> 05:53.040
Congratulations!

05:55.640 --> 05:56.830
Champagne?

05:56.880 --> 05:59.830
No, thank you.
We've only just finished breakfast.

05:59.880 --> 06:01.360
How lovely, thank you.

06:06.640 --> 06:08.760
How long have you been married?

06:09.960 --> 06:11.110
Two weeks.

06:11.160 --> 06:13.470
It was a whirlwind romance.

06:13.520 --> 06:15.910
I couldn't wait to make her my wife.

06:15.960 --> 06:17.350
How romantic.

06:17.400 --> 06:20.750
Caterina attended one of my lectures.

06:20.800 --> 06:22.550
I looked up...

06:22.600 --> 06:25.310
and there she was,
sitting before me in the front row.

06:25.360 --> 06:27.790
So you're a student of archaeology?

06:27.840 --> 06:30.390
I am a student of many things,

06:30.440 --> 06:35.280
and the whole world knows the
exploits of Sir Raleigh Beresford.

06:37.040 --> 06:38.350
When can I see Amenhotep?

06:39.760 --> 06:43.270
Oh, I'm sorry... I beg your pardon.

06:43.320 --> 06:45.070
Fingers and thumbs!

06:45.120 --> 06:47.590
Yes, I was going to tell you.

06:47.640 --> 06:50.960
I've donated him to
the Oriental Institute in Chicago.

06:52.680 --> 06:55.600
Well, say something, man. I thought
you of all people would approve.

06:56.840 --> 06:58.950
I'm surprised. You always swore...

06:59.000 --> 07:00.960
A man can change his mind.

07:02.560 --> 07:04.670
Who is Amenhotep?

07:04.720 --> 07:05.790
Raleigh's Mummy,

07:05.840 --> 07:07.390
locked away for decades...

07:07.440 --> 07:09.830
intact, and unwrapped.

07:09.880 --> 07:11.480
Not on display in the museum?

07:12.560 --> 07:13.670
Security reasons.

07:13.720 --> 07:16.270
But now he'll be shared with
the whole world...

07:16.320 --> 07:19.590
and your name will be immortalised.

07:19.640 --> 07:20.920
I want to see him.

07:22.720 --> 07:23.710
And you will.

07:23.760 --> 07:26.440
I want to see him now.

07:36.440 --> 07:37.640
I say...

07:39.040 --> 07:40.270
It's very dusty.

07:40.320 --> 07:42.800
The chamber hasn't been opened
in decades.

07:46.720 --> 07:48.800
'I wouldn't if I were you.'

07:50.000 --> 07:51.590
Have you taken leave of your senses?

07:51.640 --> 07:55.430
My son, Leo.
Soft. No sense of danger.

07:55.480 --> 07:57.950
And you've already lost one wife.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.750
Are you really going to be
so careless with another?

08:00.800 --> 08:03.590
Hasn't he told you it is cursed?

08:03.640 --> 08:05.230
I want to see inside.

08:05.280 --> 08:06.830
The air is too humid.

08:06.880 --> 08:09.600
It must be opened
under laboratory conditions.

08:12.040 --> 08:14.110
How beautiful he is.

08:14.160 --> 08:18.440
"How beautiful he is."

08:22.440 --> 08:25.950
Aristocratic, flame-haired beauty,

08:26.000 --> 08:29.670
crushed within the stagnant
confines of her class.

08:29.720 --> 08:31.230
Ripe for adventure.

08:31.280 --> 08:34.510
Thrown into the company
of a mysterious explorer,

08:34.559 --> 08:37.400
bound on an expedition for Egypt.

08:40.280 --> 08:43.230
~ I trust I won't have to consult my
lawyers? ~ I guarantee you won't.

08:43.280 --> 08:45.870
~ ('Amenhote-e-ep...')
~ The book starts in...

08:47.880 --> 08:50.840
Goodness, child.
You look as if you've seen a ghost.

08:52.360 --> 08:53.880
I tho... I thought I...

09:00.200 --> 09:01.350
I'll come with you.

09:01.400 --> 09:03.230
Non!

09:03.280 --> 09:05.440
You must stay with your guests.

09:11.160 --> 09:14.750
I confess to curiosity
about your cursed mummy.

09:14.800 --> 09:16.360
Wretched thing killed my mother.

09:17.400 --> 09:19.350
Evelyn was on Raleigh's expedition.

09:19.400 --> 09:20.710
There was a rock fall.

09:20.760 --> 09:22.390
She was killed, instantly,

09:22.440 --> 09:24.310
along with two Egyptian bearers.

09:24.360 --> 09:25.950
I'm very sorry.

09:26.000 --> 09:29.230
"He who disturbs the appointed of
the Gods shall suffer their wrath."

09:29.280 --> 09:30.520
Enough!

09:31.680 --> 09:34.510
I've put the past behind me
and so will you.

09:34.560 --> 09:35.920
God help me, that's an order.

09:45.400 --> 09:47.990
The view of the lake
is wonderful at this time of year.

09:48.040 --> 09:49.230
Oh, good.

09:49.280 --> 09:50.440
When was the house built?

10:27.920 --> 10:30.520
(Amenhote-e-e-p.)

10:44.240 --> 10:45.950
God and his Holy saints!

10:46.000 --> 10:47.990
~ Are you all right?
~ Perfectly!

10:48.040 --> 10:49.630
I thought you were lying down.

10:49.680 --> 10:51.470
I needed some air!

10:51.520 --> 10:54.270
Do you have to monitor
my every breath?!

10:54.320 --> 10:55.480
I'm going to change.

11:09.200 --> 11:10.790
I need a bloody drink.

11:10.840 --> 11:11.950
Why don't I fetch some?

11:12.000 --> 11:14.080
God damn it all, woman,
stop fussing me!

11:17.280 --> 11:18.520
Trouble in paradise?

11:19.960 --> 11:21.320
Paradise?

11:31.240 --> 11:34.160
(Cateri-i-ina-a-a.)

11:59.800 --> 12:03.270
'Amenhote-e-e-ep...'

12:03.320 --> 12:04.310
Goodbye, Father!

12:07.640 --> 12:08.630
Key's in the lock.

12:18.400 --> 12:19.720
She's dead.

12:34.200 --> 12:35.440
Amen!

12:39.240 --> 12:40.310
Ah...amen...

12:40.360 --> 12:42.040
Amen.. ho.. tep...

12:47.560 --> 12:49.750
Sergeant, what do we know about
the victim?

12:49.800 --> 12:52.070
Caterina Beresford, 21.

12:52.120 --> 12:54.710
~ Ah, Sir Raleigh's daughter?
~ Wife, sir.

12:54.760 --> 12:57.710
Witnesses heard screams and the
victim struggling with an assailant,

12:57.760 --> 12:59.190
but by the time they got there...

12:59.240 --> 13:00.990
Yeah, any indication as to
cause of death?

13:01.040 --> 13:03.310
Not yet. Police surgeon's on his
way.

13:03.360 --> 13:05.390
~ Oh, one other thing, sir.
~ Yes?

13:05.440 --> 13:07.110
According to the witness
who found her,

13:07.160 --> 13:09.190
the door was locked from the inside.

13:09.240 --> 13:11.240
That's all I need.
Who was this witness?

13:13.640 --> 13:15.550
Detective Inspector Sullivan,

13:15.600 --> 13:17.350
Kembleford Po...

13:17.400 --> 13:19.320
lice. Thank you.

13:21.040 --> 13:23.310
My condolences on the
death of your wife, Sir,

13:23.360 --> 13:25.230
but I need to ask you all
some questions.

13:25.280 --> 13:27.360
I'll ask the questions, policeman.

13:28.600 --> 13:30.670
How did my wife die?

13:30.720 --> 13:32.920
We'll know more after
the postmortem.

13:34.120 --> 13:36.670
Sir Raleigh, you, Mr Beresford,

13:36.720 --> 13:37.760
and Miss...

13:38.960 --> 13:39.950
Oliphant.

13:40.000 --> 13:43.430
.. Oliphant were unaccounted
for at the time of death,

13:43.480 --> 13:45.790
so I shall require an account of
your whereabouts.

13:45.840 --> 13:47.070
Damn your impertinence!

13:47.120 --> 13:50.950
I was in the office making
phone calls and typing letters.

13:51.000 --> 13:53.870
Did you make any phone
calls between 3.00 and 3.10?

13:53.920 --> 13:55.430
I'm not...

13:55.480 --> 13:56.760
No, I don't think so.

13:58.360 --> 13:59.520
Mr Beresford?

14:01.000 --> 14:02.750
I was in the garage.

14:02.800 --> 14:05.200
My car developed a little rattle
on the way down.

14:06.360 --> 14:08.790
Do you have a habit of acting
as your own mechanic?

14:08.840 --> 14:10.800
Only when I'm in
the middle of nowhere.

14:12.720 --> 14:14.150
Which leaves you, Sir Raleigh.

14:14.200 --> 14:15.480
I was in my study...

14:16.760 --> 14:18.880
.. alone. For all the good
it will do you.

14:21.720 --> 14:24.720
And my wife's bedroom door
was locked from the inside.

14:26.040 --> 14:27.960
Before she died, she spoke a name.

14:30.040 --> 14:31.080
Amenhotep.

14:32.280 --> 14:34.030
God, no.

14:34.080 --> 14:35.440
Don't say I didn't warn you.

14:39.560 --> 14:41.470
And where can I find Mr...

14:41.520 --> 14:42.960
Amen... hotep?

14:46.080 --> 14:47.190
Sir!

14:47.240 --> 14:48.430
Sir!

14:48.480 --> 14:50.230
The Chief Super wants updating, sir.

14:50.280 --> 14:52.830
You can tell the Chief Super
I've an unexplained death,

14:52.880 --> 14:54.630
a houseful of people with no alibi,

14:54.680 --> 14:56.840
and a 3,000-year-old Mummy
on the prowl.

14:58.960 --> 15:01.230
Don't tell the Chief Superintendent
that, Sergeant.

15:01.280 --> 15:02.310
Yes, sir.

15:02.360 --> 15:03.400
No, sir.

15:20.400 --> 15:24.110
A Mr Lincoln from Chicago
phoned earlier this morning.

15:24.160 --> 15:26.630
They want to know when they can pack
the Mummy for shipment.

15:26.680 --> 15:28.000
Never!

15:29.560 --> 15:31.200
Tell him the answer's never.

15:38.760 --> 15:41.750
I don't mean to intrude
upon your grief.

15:41.800 --> 15:43.190
But, as Caterina was a Catholic,

15:43.240 --> 15:46.150
I was wondering if you'd like
a mass said for her soul.

15:46.200 --> 15:47.870
What good will it do?

15:47.920 --> 15:50.350
It would give comfort to her family.

15:50.400 --> 15:51.760
She has no family.

15:52.800 --> 15:55.790
They were all lost in France
during the war.

15:55.840 --> 15:57.550
You should eat something.

15:57.600 --> 15:58.830
I can't eat.

15:58.880 --> 16:01.000
How can anyone eat at a time
like this?

16:09.120 --> 16:11.830
What did Leo mean when he said
his mother's death

16:11.880 --> 16:13.160
was "only the start"?

16:15.160 --> 16:19.670
Beresford bought Amenhotep back to
London for a public unwrapping,

16:19.720 --> 16:22.350
in front of the creme de la creme
of the archaeological world,

16:22.400 --> 16:24.830
all gnashing their teeth
at his coup.

16:24.880 --> 16:25.960
It never took place.

16:27.160 --> 16:29.230
Dickie was next to die,

16:29.280 --> 16:32.350
Raleigh's younger brother,
and a member of the expedition.

16:32.400 --> 16:36.590
On the boat home, he fell
mysteriously overboard and drowned.

16:36.640 --> 16:41.310
The day of the unwrapping,
Leo was struck down with fever.

16:41.360 --> 16:44.910
Evelyn should never have taken
a two-year-old child to Egypt,

16:44.960 --> 16:48.150
where it's hardly surprising
he picked up some terrible...

16:48.200 --> 16:49.390
tropical disease.

16:49.440 --> 16:52.270
Beresford was deranged with
paranoia.

16:52.320 --> 16:55.270
He found some self-styled Egyptian
priest

16:55.320 --> 16:58.110
to perform prayers of exorcism

16:58.160 --> 17:00.510
and re-entombed Amenhotep.

17:00.560 --> 17:02.510
Later that evening,

17:02.560 --> 17:03.680
Leo's fever broke...

17:05.319 --> 17:08.069
.. and Beresford has never set
eyes on the Mummy since.

17:08.119 --> 17:09.160
Until now.

17:15.359 --> 17:17.510
I'd like you and Mr Beresford
to remove your shirts.

17:17.560 --> 17:19.270
How dare you!

17:19.319 --> 17:21.950
The police surgeon found
traces of blood and skin

17:22.000 --> 17:23.550
under your wife's fingernails,

17:23.599 --> 17:25.630
along with evidence of bruising to
her neck.

17:25.680 --> 17:27.589
This is merely for
purposes of elimination.

17:27.640 --> 17:29.550
And what if I refuse?

17:29.600 --> 17:31.430
That's your prerogative, Sir.

17:31.480 --> 17:33.550
I assumed you'd prefer
to do this privately,

17:33.600 --> 17:36.360
but we can continue at the station
if you choose.

17:39.000 --> 17:41.080
~ Damn you.
~ I can explain.

17:45.800 --> 17:46.840
'I loved her.'

17:48.680 --> 17:49.720
Leave him!

17:50.800 --> 17:52.910
Come with me. Why stay?

17:52.960 --> 17:55.990
For the same reason I married him,
silly boy.

17:56.040 --> 17:58.430
So you ARE what everyone thinks...

17:58.480 --> 18:01.830
just a vulgar little gold-digger.

18:01.880 --> 18:02.920
Leo...

18:04.200 --> 18:05.240
.. so naive!

18:06.320 --> 18:07.360
And what about us?

18:08.880 --> 18:11.470
There is no us!

18:11.520 --> 18:14.510
You are a diversion
that has stopped being diverting

18:14.560 --> 18:16.160
and has become... tedious.

18:17.560 --> 18:18.880
A diversion!?

18:20.440 --> 18:23.750
Just some piece of rag
that you can use and toss aside?

18:23.800 --> 18:25.040
I won't let you.

18:28.400 --> 18:29.680
Aah!

18:36.280 --> 18:37.270
You little...

18:37.320 --> 18:38.990
I knew it!

18:39.040 --> 18:41.670
Leo Beresford, I'm arresting you on
suspicion

18:41.720 --> 18:43.870
of the murder of Caterina Beresford.

18:43.920 --> 18:45.230
I didn't do it.

18:45.280 --> 18:46.750
I couldn't! I loved her.

18:46.800 --> 18:49.270
You forced yourself on her,
admit it, damn you!

18:49.320 --> 18:50.830
You are not obliged to say anything,

18:50.880 --> 18:53.550
but anything you do say will be
taken down in writing and may...

18:53.600 --> 18:54.640
Stop!

18:55.760 --> 18:57.160
He's telling the truth.

18:58.520 --> 18:59.560
I did it.

19:00.600 --> 19:01.880
I murdered Caterina.

19:03.920 --> 19:07.870
26 stalls
is rather excessive, Mrs McCarthy.

19:07.920 --> 19:10.150
Well, it's not as if
you don't have the space.

19:10.200 --> 19:12.270
Just think of it
as your Christian duty.

19:12.320 --> 19:16.030
But do we have to have
Splat the Rat in the walled garden?

19:16.080 --> 19:19.150
My camomile lawn will never survive
the hoards of rampaging children.

19:19.200 --> 19:20.470
Mrs McCarthy, Lady Felicia.

19:20.520 --> 19:23.470
There you are, Father. Now, what did
the doctor say about...?

19:23.520 --> 19:25.190
~ Miss Oliph...
~ What is that smell?

19:25.240 --> 19:27.230
~ Valer...
~ Camphor oil.

19:27.280 --> 19:29.200
For all the good
it will do your gout!

19:30.440 --> 19:33.600
Valerie Oliphant has
confessed to the murder of Caterina.

19:35.040 --> 19:37.150
~ No! ~ But she's second
soprano of the church choir!

19:37.200 --> 19:39.790
Why would you confess to a murder
you didn't commit?

19:39.840 --> 19:43.070
To protect someone whose life
is worth more than your own.

19:43.120 --> 19:46.110
You and Sir Raleigh had an affair?

19:46.160 --> 19:47.470
It may be hard to imagine now,

19:47.520 --> 19:50.910
but at one time I possessed
if not beauty then a bloom of youth.

19:50.960 --> 19:53.600
~ I didn't mean to imply...
~ There's no need to apologise.

19:54.720 --> 19:55.910
And this was...?

19:55.960 --> 19:57.110
Decades ago.

19:57.160 --> 19:58.150
Why did it end?

19:58.200 --> 19:59.990
He was married.

20:00.040 --> 20:02.670
I was just a notch on his bedpost.

20:02.720 --> 20:05.160
Yet you stayed in his employ
all this time.

20:06.240 --> 20:08.670
A woman may hope, Inspector.

20:08.720 --> 20:11.390
And, for 30 years,
I've been as a wife to him,

20:11.440 --> 20:12.910
in every way but one.

20:12.960 --> 20:15.270
Did Caterina Beresford
dash that hope?

20:15.320 --> 20:17.630
She would have driven him
to his grave,

20:17.680 --> 20:19.070
gold-digging little minx.

20:19.120 --> 20:20.870
Pardon my language, but...

20:20.920 --> 20:22.510
she deserved what she got.

20:22.560 --> 20:23.600
Which was?

20:24.720 --> 20:26.520
I killed her.

20:28.000 --> 20:30.510
I put my hands round her neck...

20:30.560 --> 20:33.160
and I squeezed the life from her.

20:35.520 --> 20:38.030
And then locked the door
behind you?

20:38.080 --> 20:40.510
I have a master key
to every room in the house.

20:40.560 --> 20:42.990
I locked the door afterwards...

20:43.040 --> 20:45.270
to buy myself time to get away.

20:45.320 --> 20:47.830
Father Brown swears that
the key was in the lock.

20:47.880 --> 20:49.480
Father Brown was mistaken.

20:50.920 --> 20:52.510
In that case, Valerie Oliphant,

20:52.560 --> 20:55.440
I am charging you with the murder of
Caterina Beresford.

21:11.440 --> 21:13.040
Your wife was beautiful.

21:14.720 --> 21:16.270
I had TWO beautiful wives.

21:16.320 --> 21:17.480
Your business?

21:21.360 --> 21:24.560
A member of my flock
has confessed to murder.

21:25.720 --> 21:29.070
I believe she's protecting your son.

21:29.120 --> 21:30.790
More fool her.

21:30.840 --> 21:32.270
Leo couldn't kill anyone,

21:32.320 --> 21:35.070
the milksop doesn't have it in him.

21:35.120 --> 21:38.640
An apple fallen so far from the tree
it landed in the next field.

21:42.000 --> 21:43.520
He takes after his mother...

21:45.640 --> 21:46.840
.. his real mother.

21:51.680 --> 21:55.320
I couldn't help noticing the way
her eyes follow him...

21:57.480 --> 21:59.670
.. watching his every move.

21:59.720 --> 22:02.840
Once you look for the resemblances,
you can see them.

22:10.480 --> 22:12.560
Confessional rules apply, Priest.

22:16.480 --> 22:18.000
Or do I have to be a left-footer?

22:22.600 --> 22:25.240
God does not discriminate.

22:35.240 --> 22:36.870
After we were married,

22:36.920 --> 22:39.950
I discovered Evelyn was infertile.

22:40.000 --> 22:43.080
Imagine a man like me
without prospect of son and heir.

22:45.240 --> 22:47.950
It must have been
devastating for you both.

22:48.000 --> 22:49.840
When Valerie fell pregnant...

22:51.280 --> 22:52.360
.. I made her an offer.

22:54.120 --> 22:56.390
Leo was born abroad...

22:56.440 --> 22:58.230
to Lady Beresford

22:58.280 --> 23:01.000
and returned to England
as mine and Evelyn's son.

23:03.360 --> 23:05.790
His real mother Valerie came back.

23:05.840 --> 23:07.790
You think that was my idea?

23:07.840 --> 23:10.920
That was her only condition -
to see him grow.

23:13.240 --> 23:15.960
After Evelyn died, surely...?

23:18.680 --> 23:22.790
What? That... I should have
proffered my hand in marriage?

23:22.840 --> 23:25.400
Her father was a bought ledger
clerk...

23:27.760 --> 23:30.790
.. and I didn't have to buy her
silence.

23:30.840 --> 23:32.720
My documentation is irrefutable.

23:34.480 --> 23:38.310
Who'd believe the ramblings
of an obsessed woman? No...

23:38.360 --> 23:40.830
she'll take her secret with her
to the grave.

23:40.880 --> 23:43.750
Which will be
sooner rather than later,

23:43.800 --> 23:45.720
unless we find the murderer.

23:48.800 --> 23:50.880
My wife didn't die by human hand.

23:52.600 --> 23:53.760
And I...

23:54.880 --> 23:56.800
.. don't believe in ghosts.

23:58.360 --> 24:01.920
Your whole system of faith is based
on a man risen from the dead.

24:05.240 --> 24:08.110
Caterina died alone in a locked room.

24:08.160 --> 24:09.600
She named her killer.

24:10.680 --> 24:13.390
Leave Amenhotep in peace,

24:13.440 --> 24:16.560
or I warn you, Priest,
you'll be next.

24:20.600 --> 24:24.710
Yes, obviously there are a few
outstanding enquiries

24:24.760 --> 24:26.310
to complete, but...

24:26.360 --> 24:29.110
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

24:29.160 --> 24:31.600
Yes, indeed. I'll do my utmost.

24:36.600 --> 24:38.750
Ah, yes. Goodbye, sir.

24:40.400 --> 24:42.270
Valerie Oliphant is innocent.

24:42.320 --> 24:43.470
She's protecting someone,

24:43.520 --> 24:45.390
which means the murderer
is still at large,

24:45.440 --> 24:47.440
but something tells me
you already know that.

24:48.800 --> 24:51.630
You have exactly 20 seconds
to get out of my office,

24:51.680 --> 24:54.710
or I'll have you arrested
and thrown in the cells.

24:54.760 --> 24:55.950
On what charge?

24:56.000 --> 24:57.070
Anything.

24:57.120 --> 24:58.950
I'll find something that will stick!

24:59.000 --> 25:00.320
Very well, Inspector.

25:05.000 --> 25:08.470
Miss Oliphant, the postmortem shows
that Lady Beresford

25:08.520 --> 25:10.030
didn't die of strangulation,

25:10.080 --> 25:12.400
which means you
have some explaining to do.

25:46.080 --> 25:49.510
'Sergeant, release Valerie Oliphant
on bail for wasting police time.'

25:49.560 --> 25:51.040
'Right away, sir.'

25:53.560 --> 25:57.030
Lady Felicia, do you mind if I ask
what it is that you're doing?

25:57.080 --> 26:00.320
Inspector, how fortuitous.
Do take a seat.

26:01.720 --> 26:03.000
You're in my chair.

26:04.640 --> 26:08.750
I'm writing you a note about a soiree
I'm holding next month,

26:08.800 --> 26:12.040
just some local luminaries
and rising stars of the district.

26:13.640 --> 26:14.950
Yes?

26:15.000 --> 26:17.800
It's for
"Inspector Sullivan and Guest."

26:20.640 --> 26:23.040
Do you have someone
you'd like to bring?

26:24.720 --> 26:26.350
No.

26:26.400 --> 26:29.390
No... young lady in your life?

26:29.440 --> 26:31.870
No, Lady Felicia, I...

26:31.920 --> 26:33.280
Shame.

26:34.600 --> 26:36.430
And you so...

26:36.480 --> 26:37.880
young and handsome.

26:40.720 --> 26:41.960
Don't you get lonely?

26:44.120 --> 26:45.710
Thank you for this.

26:45.760 --> 26:47.400
I shall endeavour to be there.

26:48.440 --> 26:49.680
I look forward to it.

26:50.960 --> 26:52.080
Right.

26:59.200 --> 27:01.400
Au revoir... Inspector.

27:11.040 --> 27:14.590
'And now, yesterday's results
from Thirsk.

27:14.640 --> 27:18.590
'2.50, The Archibald
House Novices Hurdle.

27:18.640 --> 27:19.910
'First, Mr Neil...'

27:19.960 --> 27:21.710
Dr Fairfax has had a cancellation...

27:21.760 --> 27:24.310
~ 'Second, Half A Policeman...'
~ .. and can squeeze you in at...

27:24.360 --> 27:26.440
'Third, Troubled Parishioner.'

27:28.600 --> 27:30.030
.. at five o'clock.

27:30.080 --> 27:31.990
Hello, all.

27:32.040 --> 27:33.190
Mission accomplished?

27:33.240 --> 27:37.830
Rather. Caterina wasn't strangled -
she was poisoned with atropine.

27:37.880 --> 27:39.510
Ah-ha.

27:39.560 --> 27:40.880
What are you thinking?

27:42.920 --> 27:45.880
The answer to the mystery
is that there is no mystery.

27:46.880 --> 27:50.680
The crime was committed before
Caterina even entered that room.

27:55.160 --> 27:56.560
Valerie.

27:58.320 --> 28:00.390
Why didn't you tell me
you were being released?

28:00.440 --> 28:01.990
I would have met you.

28:02.040 --> 28:03.270
I didn't want a fuss.

28:03.320 --> 28:05.350
I wouldn't consider it one.

28:05.400 --> 28:06.830
Dear Walter,

28:06.880 --> 28:08.200
what would I do without you?

28:10.200 --> 28:11.750
Then come away with me.

28:11.800 --> 28:14.030
My offer still stands.

28:14.080 --> 28:16.350
I have means for both of us.

28:16.400 --> 28:18.600
You needn't be at
his beck and call ever again.

28:19.680 --> 28:21.190
I can't.

28:21.240 --> 28:23.950
I know you think
he murdered his wife.

28:24.000 --> 28:28.190
Why else would you make such
a ludicrous confession?

28:28.240 --> 28:31.110
Stay here when you could be next?

28:31.160 --> 28:34.150
Or the house by the sea
you've always yearned for?

28:34.200 --> 28:35.950
Devon or Cornwall.

28:36.000 --> 28:37.520
The South of France.

28:38.880 --> 28:39.990
Sounds nice.

28:40.040 --> 28:41.240
Then say the word.

28:42.720 --> 28:43.760
Say yes.

28:48.720 --> 28:49.840
I'm sorry.

29:16.320 --> 29:18.320
What do you expect to find, Father?

29:20.600 --> 29:21.640
Well...

29:22.640 --> 29:25.590
.. it's rather what
I expect NOT to find.

29:25.640 --> 29:27.750
Don't tell me my employer has
convinced you

29:27.800 --> 29:29.790
that Amenhotep
is risen from the tomb

29:29.840 --> 29:31.790
and prowling the corridors?

29:31.840 --> 29:33.320
Caterina wasn't cursed.

29:34.320 --> 29:36.200
She died of atropine poisoning.

29:37.960 --> 29:39.670
I don't understand.

29:39.720 --> 29:41.000
Eye drops.

29:42.120 --> 29:44.110
I picked up your eye drops
at the surgery.

29:44.160 --> 29:45.430
'So innocuous...'

29:45.480 --> 29:46.470
Thank you.

29:46.520 --> 29:49.360
'but a deadly poison
and a powerful hallucinogenic.'

29:50.360 --> 29:53.190
A colourless, odourless poison,

29:53.240 --> 29:57.710
just sitting there, in your pocket.

29:57.760 --> 29:59.550
Top me up, Hubble!

29:59.600 --> 30:01.520
Temptation must have been
overwhelming.

30:04.960 --> 30:07.070
But I dread to think...

30:07.120 --> 30:10.920
what horrors Caterina saw
before she died.

30:11.920 --> 30:13.270
Why would I kill her?

30:13.320 --> 30:15.910
Because she was the driving force

30:15.960 --> 30:17.840
behind Sir Raleigh's change of
heart.

30:19.080 --> 30:21.830
Because, at all costs,

30:21.880 --> 30:27.150
you had to stop Amenhotep
being disentombed.

30:27.200 --> 30:29.270
I'm an archaeologist!

30:29.320 --> 30:32.510
I seek to uncover the past,
not bury it.

30:32.560 --> 30:33.910
But...

30:33.960 --> 30:35.960
what lies buried here?

30:37.440 --> 30:39.280
This is not just a tomb, is it?

30:41.040 --> 30:42.360
It's a treasure trove...

30:43.880 --> 30:45.590
.. locked away,

30:45.640 --> 30:48.430
undisturbed for decades.

30:48.480 --> 30:49.670
That's absurd.

30:49.720 --> 30:51.830
Well, there's one way to find out.

30:51.880 --> 30:53.080
Very well, Father.

30:54.160 --> 30:55.600
I have nothing to fear.

31:16.600 --> 31:18.110
Ohhhhh!

31:18.160 --> 31:20.790
Oh, I was hoping
you wouldn't recover consciousness.

31:20.840 --> 31:22.750
How very thoughtful.

31:22.800 --> 31:26.800
I want you to know my actions were
for the most chivalrous of reasons.

31:27.880 --> 31:29.630
A damsel in distress.

31:29.680 --> 31:31.470
Yes.

31:31.520 --> 31:34.510
How could I provide her with
an escape on a Curator's salary?

31:34.560 --> 31:38.510
And a hoard of riches
before your eyes.

31:38.560 --> 31:41.670
Treasures that would never see
the light of day,

31:41.720 --> 31:44.590
so I removed it
to examine at my leisure.

31:44.640 --> 31:47.310
To desecrate at your leisure.

31:47.360 --> 31:49.150
Semantics.

31:49.200 --> 31:52.390
What's to differentiate the
archaeologist from the grave robber,

31:52.440 --> 31:55.030
bar education and hubris?

31:55.080 --> 31:59.350
Fortunately, antiquities attract
the sort of collectors

31:59.400 --> 32:01.270
who don't ask questions.

32:03.160 --> 32:05.080
What about Amenhotep?

32:07.960 --> 32:10.680
Nothing more than dust and bones.

32:12.720 --> 32:14.360
The remains of a mortal man.

32:15.360 --> 32:17.190
A husk, expired millennia ago,

32:17.240 --> 32:20.230
despite what my employer
may have believed.

32:20.280 --> 32:22.430
But as long as he believed,

32:22.480 --> 32:24.630
your secret was safe...

32:24.680 --> 32:28.870
until the arrival of
the second Mrs Beresford.

32:28.920 --> 32:31.030
Scheming little minx,

32:31.080 --> 32:32.440
blinded by greed...

32:33.840 --> 32:36.470
.. and he blinded by her.

32:36.520 --> 32:38.950
You murdered...

32:39.000 --> 32:40.550
an innocent girl.

32:40.600 --> 32:44.270
I had no intention of spending
the rest of my days in prison...

32:44.320 --> 32:47.670
and that little trollop
was anything but innocent.

32:47.720 --> 32:49.080
Whereas I...

32:50.560 --> 32:53.950
.. endeavoured to save
a genuinely virtuous woman

32:54.000 --> 32:58.520
from a life of servitude,
and regret.

33:00.720 --> 33:01.710
Only...

33:01.760 --> 33:02.840
O-o-oh!

33:04.520 --> 33:06.040
Walter, Walter...

33:07.360 --> 33:08.600
.. she turned you down.

33:11.000 --> 33:12.790
I'm so sorry.

33:12.840 --> 33:14.960
"A faint heart never won fair lady."

33:17.160 --> 33:18.680
I am a patient man, Father.

33:20.880 --> 33:22.000
She'll see...

33:24.000 --> 33:25.240
.. in time.

33:27.080 --> 33:29.280
~ She'll see.
~ Repent...

33:30.560 --> 33:32.910
.. and you will be forgiven.

33:32.960 --> 33:35.160
You shouldn't have meddled, Father.

33:37.240 --> 33:40.790
This is regrettable,
but will be painless

33:40.840 --> 33:43.030
and give you time to make peace
with your God,

33:43.080 --> 33:45.190
and pray for your soul.

33:45.240 --> 33:49.000
I'd rather use my time
to pray for yours.

34:11.760 --> 34:13.389
Mr Hubble!

34:13.440 --> 34:16.230
I don't suppose you've seen
Father Brown? He's gone AWOL.

34:16.280 --> 34:18.710
Oh, not since this morning.

34:18.760 --> 34:20.920
Perhaps he's dropped in on Valerie.

34:22.440 --> 34:25.440
What did I tell you?
He won't be far from the biscuit tin.

34:26.679 --> 34:27.880
He's lying.

34:29.520 --> 34:31.270
Didn't you smell him, Mrs M?

34:31.320 --> 34:33.110
A distinct whiff of...

34:33.159 --> 34:34.480
Camphor oil.

34:48.320 --> 34:49.800
He was here.

34:51.040 --> 34:54.270
Well, he's not here now. Praise be.

34:54.320 --> 34:57.270
Nasty heathen place.

34:57.320 --> 34:59.830
The dead should be buried
IN the ground,

34:59.880 --> 35:02.350
not lying around on display
like ornaments.

35:02.400 --> 35:03.630
Sh-sh!

35:03.680 --> 35:05.030
What is it?

35:05.080 --> 35:06.520
I can hear something.

35:09.040 --> 35:12.550
The only thing I can hear is the
sound of an over-active imagination.

35:12.600 --> 35:16.230
~ Now, can we get out of here?
~ Wait! ~ Horrible spooky place.

35:16.280 --> 35:17.710
Wait, wait!

35:17.760 --> 35:20.400
Oh, what are you doing now?

35:22.120 --> 35:25.000
3,000-year-old mummies don't bleed.

35:28.480 --> 35:30.510
Oh, no.

35:30.560 --> 35:31.600
Really?

35:32.680 --> 35:34.990
~ There's only one way to find out.
~ No!

35:35.040 --> 35:38.710
"He who disturbs the appointed of
the Gods shall suffer their wrath!"

35:38.760 --> 35:40.710
Not half as much as
they'll suffer mine

35:40.760 --> 35:43.030
if any harm's come to the Father.

35:43.080 --> 35:44.950
Are you just going to stand there,

35:45.000 --> 35:47.280
or are you going to help me
lift this lid?

35:55.960 --> 35:57.200
Oh, he's dead!

36:00.200 --> 36:01.990
Not yet, he isn't.

36:02.040 --> 36:03.390
Father.

36:03.440 --> 36:04.720
Father, wake up.

36:06.640 --> 36:08.350
Come on, Father, wake up!

36:08.400 --> 36:10.430
It's no good, Mrs M!

36:10.480 --> 36:13.550
~ His left foot.
~ What?
~ Don't ask!

36:13.600 --> 36:15.750
Give his big toe a good tweak,

36:15.800 --> 36:17.520
as hard as you can!

36:18.880 --> 36:21.070
Rise and shine, Father!

36:21.120 --> 36:23.230
Your time has not yet come.

36:23.280 --> 36:25.270
Sorry, Father.

36:28.440 --> 36:30.400
Thank you, Sir Raleigh.
I'll be in touch.

36:32.440 --> 36:34.230
"Faint heart never won fair lady."

36:34.280 --> 36:35.670
Ah, Mr Hubble.

36:35.720 --> 36:38.710
The investigation has revealed that
Lady Beresford died of poisoning,

36:38.760 --> 36:41.390
which makes it necessary
to re-interview everyone.

36:41.440 --> 36:43.030
Of course, Inspector.

36:43.080 --> 36:44.520
Whatever I can do to help.

36:55.000 --> 36:56.550
Mr Hubble!

36:56.600 --> 36:57.640
Mr Hubble!

37:08.120 --> 37:09.350
Mr Hubble!

37:09.400 --> 37:10.750
Mr Hubble, stay where you are!

37:55.960 --> 37:57.430
Ah!

37:57.480 --> 37:58.790
Whoa!

37:58.840 --> 38:01.240
('Amenhote-e-e-ep...')

38:02.520 --> 38:05.110
('Amenhote-e-e-ep...')

38:05.160 --> 38:06.320
Aargh!

38:13.600 --> 38:14.640
Help!

38:16.360 --> 38:18.910
Help!

38:18.960 --> 38:20.920
('Hubble...')

38:53.400 --> 38:56.110
I think some hot tea is in order.

38:56.160 --> 38:57.430
No, thank you.

38:57.480 --> 38:59.870
Nonsense.
You are chilled to the bone.

38:59.920 --> 39:01.350
Take it from me, Inspector,

39:01.400 --> 39:03.270
resistance is futile.

39:03.320 --> 39:05.190
Oh.

39:05.240 --> 39:08.990
I hear Father Brown has you ladies
to thank for a timely rescue.

39:09.040 --> 39:10.230
How is he?

39:10.280 --> 39:12.270
Oh, don't you be worrying about him.

39:12.320 --> 39:15.390
That man has the constitution
of an ox

39:15.440 --> 39:17.070
and the luck of the devil.

39:17.120 --> 39:18.430
Sir!

39:18.480 --> 39:20.710
Looks like his foot
got tangled in the weeds -

39:20.760 --> 39:22.640
that'll be what dragged him down.

39:26.520 --> 39:28.630
Where do you think you're going?

39:28.680 --> 39:31.110
As the police no longer
require my presence,

39:31.160 --> 39:32.590
as far away from here as possible.

39:32.640 --> 39:34.710
You're going nowhere,
until you admit you lied.

39:34.760 --> 39:35.790
I told the truth.

39:35.840 --> 39:38.350
You forced yourself on my wife
and she defended her honour.

39:38.400 --> 39:41.710
~ There was no affair. Caterina was
innocent. ~ Just say it, Leo.

39:41.760 --> 39:44.360
It doesn't matter, just... say what
he wants to hear.

39:46.800 --> 39:49.120
You may have raised
a milksop for a son...

39:50.800 --> 39:52.390
.. but he isn't a liar.

39:52.440 --> 39:54.270
Please!

39:54.320 --> 39:55.390
No!

39:55.440 --> 39:57.550
No, where will you go?

39:57.600 --> 39:59.190
I don't know.

39:59.240 --> 40:00.950
Steam boat to South America.

40:01.000 --> 40:02.200
French Foreign Legion.

40:03.560 --> 40:05.630
~ Don't cry, Valerie.
~ No!

40:05.680 --> 40:07.950
I'll miss you.

40:08.000 --> 40:11.150
For as long as I can remember
you've always been...

40:11.200 --> 40:12.400
there.

40:13.840 --> 40:15.440
I'll write.

40:27.480 --> 40:28.710
What have you done?

40:28.760 --> 40:31.990
Your vanity and ego did this...

40:32.040 --> 40:34.200
and now you're on your own.

40:35.760 --> 40:38.640
~ I'll pack my things and leave
tonight. ~ You won't leave.

40:39.760 --> 40:41.040
I've no reason to stay.

40:42.040 --> 40:43.360
Well...

40:44.640 --> 40:46.710
~ What about...?
~ You?

40:46.760 --> 40:52.270
I stopped loving you the day
you took my child from my arms

40:52.320 --> 40:54.160
and gave him to your wife.

40:55.600 --> 40:58.080
You're a stupid, stupid man!

41:04.600 --> 41:08.310
The only curse on this house is you.

41:08.360 --> 41:11.670
It's not enough to lose two wives,

41:11.720 --> 41:13.790
you've now driven away
your only son.

41:13.840 --> 41:15.520
~ He's an adulterer.
~ As are you.

41:18.680 --> 41:22.920
Perhaps the apple landed closer
to the tree than you thought.

41:27.040 --> 41:28.640
You think I can forgive him?

41:30.560 --> 41:35.790
You should pray that he forgives you

41:35.840 --> 41:40.790
for denying him his mother
for his entire life

41:40.840 --> 41:44.870
and that she forgives YOU

41:44.920 --> 41:48.350
for taking away her son.

41:48.400 --> 41:51.400
~ It's too late to change the past,
Priest. ~ And the future?

41:54.400 --> 41:58.830
"Judge not
and you shall not be judged.

41:58.880 --> 42:02.550
"Condemn not
and you shall not be condemned.

42:02.600 --> 42:06.760
"Forgive
and you shall be forgiven."

42:19.400 --> 42:21.910
I commend the soul of
Walter Henry Hubble.

42:21.960 --> 42:24.550
May his soul, and the souls of all
the faithful departed,

42:24.600 --> 42:27.030
in the mercy of God rest in peace.

42:27.080 --> 42:28.360
Amen.

42:32.280 --> 42:33.760
Goodbye, Walter.

42:36.680 --> 42:38.910
Do you think he is at peace?

42:38.960 --> 42:42.470
His actions were not the actions
of a sane man...

42:42.520 --> 42:44.750
and God is merciful.

42:44.800 --> 42:46.790
And that's the end of that, I hope.

42:46.840 --> 42:49.040
And of all this business
about a curse!

42:51.400 --> 42:53.120
I think the curse has lifted.

42:56.360 --> 42:57.670
Will you stay here?

42:57.720 --> 42:59.670
Until I find my own house.

42:59.720 --> 43:01.230
Raleigh's been very generous

43:01.280 --> 43:04.390
and Leo's promised to come and visit
all the time.

43:04.440 --> 43:07.710
I still can't fathom his U-turn
after all these years.

43:07.760 --> 43:10.720
Confession is good for the soul.

43:12.320 --> 43:14.470
Beware Greeks bearing lunch!

43:14.520 --> 43:17.590
We have cold roast beef,
ham salad and apple tart.

43:17.640 --> 43:19.270
And a rather licentious Burgundy.

43:19.320 --> 43:20.990
Splendid.

43:21.040 --> 43:22.350
Not for you, Father.

43:22.400 --> 43:24.670
Remember what the doctor said.

43:24.720 --> 43:27.230
No red meat, no pork, no sugar

43:27.280 --> 43:30.000
and strictly no alcohol.

43:31.800 --> 43:35.120
Mrs McCarthy,
what would I do without you?
