00:00.834 --> 00:02.294
Previously on Young Sheldon...

00:02.294 --> 00:04.922
Hi, June.
Connie, Dale, this is Justin.

00:04.922 --> 00:06.548
You must be a friend
of my son's.

00:06.548 --> 00:08.508
Actually, he's my date.

00:08.508 --> 00:09.551
Really?

00:09.551 --> 00:10.594
She brought him here on purpose.

00:10.594 --> 00:12.429
What purpose?

00:12.429 --> 00:13.764
To upset me.

00:13.764 --> 00:15.515
Can you believe
that Dale thinks

00:15.515 --> 00:18.227
the only reason you brought him
here is just to piss him off?

00:18.227 --> 00:19.978
That's exactly
why I brought him.

00:19.978 --> 00:21.605
Why would you go out of your way

00:21.605 --> 00:24.524
to upset Dale
at your own son's wedding?

00:24.524 --> 00:25.525
He's my ex-husband.

00:25.525 --> 00:26.735
Well, he's my boyfriend.

00:26.735 --> 00:28.028
Hey, that's your problem.

00:28.028 --> 00:29.613
Well, you're starting
to be my problem.

00:29.613 --> 00:31.615
Dr. Linkletter,
what can I do for you?

00:31.615 --> 00:34.117
I just want to let you know,
with Dr. Sturgis away,

00:34.117 --> 00:36.745
I'll be available
should Sheldon need anything.

00:36.745 --> 00:37.996
Thank you so much.

00:37.996 --> 00:40.249
His well-being
is important to me.

00:40.249 --> 00:43.460
As was made abundantly clear
by my boss.

00:46.880 --> 00:50.175
ADULT SHELDON:
After a few short weeks
as a full-time college student,

00:50.175 --> 00:53.262
I am proud to say the transition
had gone quite nicely.

00:53.262 --> 00:57.182
My classes were going well,
I knew my way around campus

00:57.182 --> 01:00.560
and I had an active
and vibrant social life.

01:00.560 --> 01:02.729
There you are.
Why are you here?

01:02.729 --> 01:05.399
Lunch. Don't worry,
I didn't start without you.

01:05.399 --> 01:06.733
How did you get in?

01:06.733 --> 01:07.693
Janitor Jim.

01:07.693 --> 01:09.528
And why would Janitor Jim
do that?

01:09.528 --> 01:11.863
You're not my only friend
around here.

01:11.863 --> 01:13.073
(sighs)

01:13.073 --> 01:16.118
♪ Nobody else
is stronger than I am ♪

01:16.118 --> 01:19.246
♪ Yesterday I moved a mountain ♪

01:19.246 --> 01:21.456
♪ I bet I could be your hero ♪

01:21.456 --> 01:23.750
♪ I am a mighty little man ♪

01:23.750 --> 01:28.338
♪ I am a mighty little man. ♪

01:35.262 --> 01:37.597
I'll trade you my apple slices
for your pudding cup.

01:37.597 --> 01:40.600
No.
Aren't you a little old
for a pudding cup?

01:40.600 --> 01:42.436
Sheldon, surely
there's somebody else

01:42.436 --> 01:44.062
you could have lunch with.

01:44.062 --> 01:46.690
There is, but the lunch rush
is a busy time for janitors.

01:46.690 --> 01:48.734
Perhaps you could
work on widening

01:48.734 --> 01:50.277
your social circles here.

01:50.277 --> 01:51.611
I'm already at two.

01:51.611 --> 01:53.488
That's double where I was
at high school.

01:54.573 --> 01:56.033
(door closes)
GEORGE JR.: Hey.

01:56.033 --> 01:58.035
Hey. How was school?

01:58.035 --> 02:00.120
Fine. Work?
Fine.

02:00.120 --> 02:01.413
And Mom says we never talk.

02:01.413 --> 02:03.665
What is that on your belt there?

02:04.458 --> 02:06.001
It's my new beeper.

02:06.001 --> 02:07.836
Why in the world
would you need a beeper?

02:07.836 --> 02:09.588
So people can get
in touch with me.

02:09.588 --> 02:11.548
Trust me, when you're not
around, no one's thinking,

02:11.548 --> 02:13.592
"I must speak with Georgie
this minute."

02:13.592 --> 02:15.635
Hey, lots of people have these.

02:15.635 --> 02:17.012
Yeah, doctors and drug dealers,

02:17.012 --> 02:18.764
and you're not smart enough
to be either.

02:18.764 --> 02:20.640
(pager beeping, vibrating)

02:20.640 --> 02:23.477
Excuse me, I'm being beeped.

02:30.484 --> 02:32.986
Hey, I was paged
from this number.

02:34.738 --> 02:37.407
No, I'm not Bruce. Sorry.

02:37.407 --> 02:41.119
Mm, sounds like you got
a real emergency there, Bruce.

02:41.119 --> 02:42.496
(answering machine beeps)

02:42.496 --> 02:44.873
JUNE:
Hey, Connie, it's June.

02:44.873 --> 02:46.625
You know, I don't feel good
about what happened

02:46.625 --> 02:49.294
the other night, and I just
want to say I'm sorry.

02:49.294 --> 02:50.837
Could you give me a call back?

02:50.837 --> 02:52.005
Thanks.

02:52.005 --> 02:53.507
Bye.
(beeps)

02:53.507 --> 02:54.758
That's nice.

02:54.758 --> 02:56.426
I don't know why
you get an apology.

02:56.426 --> 02:58.512
I'm the one she was
trying to piss off.

02:58.512 --> 03:00.430
(chuckles):
Looks like she's still doing it.

03:00.430 --> 03:03.767
All the years we were married,
I never once got an apology.

03:03.767 --> 03:06.520
Well, you're not exactly
the apologizing kind yourself,

03:06.520 --> 03:07.646
you know.

03:07.646 --> 03:09.564
Well, that's not true.

03:09.564 --> 03:10.816
For years after

03:10.816 --> 03:12.317
we broke up,
I was telling people

03:12.317 --> 03:14.611
I was sorry I married her.

03:18.240 --> 03:19.241
(keys jingle)

03:19.241 --> 03:21.034
Thanks, Jim.

03:33.046 --> 03:35.048
Where could he be?

03:36.133 --> 03:37.884
(clears throat)

03:37.884 --> 03:39.970
(knocking on door)
SHELDON:
Dr. Linkletter?

03:39.970 --> 03:41.304
MAN:
No.

03:41.304 --> 03:43.265
SHELDON:
Sorry. You and he have
the same loafers.

03:43.265 --> 03:45.058
Carry on.

03:47.227 --> 03:51.565
The Moho lies between the mantle
and the crust, and...

03:51.565 --> 03:54.317
Excuse me, I'm looking
for Dr. Linkletter.

03:54.317 --> 03:55.485
He's not here.

03:55.485 --> 03:56.736
Sorry for wasting your time.

03:56.736 --> 03:58.488
Oh, this is geology.

03:58.488 --> 04:00.824
You're already
wasting your time.

04:02.492 --> 04:04.578
(classical music playing)

04:08.457 --> 04:09.583
What?

04:09.583 --> 04:11.460
I've been looking for you.

04:11.460 --> 04:14.004
I was just trying to
have a little privacy.

04:14.004 --> 04:17.424
Smart. No one will
bother us out here.

04:18.508 --> 04:20.552
What is that? Ham?

04:23.930 --> 04:26.099
(pager beeping, vibrating)

04:34.399 --> 04:35.734
Hello. You paged me?

04:35.734 --> 04:37.444
WOMAN:
Bruce?

04:37.444 --> 04:39.196
Sorry, you have
the wrong number.

04:39.196 --> 04:43.200
Oh. I was trying to reach
my grandson.

04:43.200 --> 04:44.951
Well, when you do,
can you have him tell people

04:44.951 --> 04:46.703
this ain't his pager no more?

04:46.703 --> 04:49.873
I was hoping he could give me
a ride to the drugstore.

04:49.873 --> 04:51.917
I need to pick up
my prescription.

04:51.917 --> 04:53.668
All right, well, good luck.

04:53.668 --> 04:56.630
I took my last heart pill
this morning.

04:56.630 --> 04:58.006
Sorry to hear that.

04:58.006 --> 05:01.802
I suppose I could walk,
if I take it slow.

05:02.928 --> 05:06.264
You are just
the little lifesaver.

05:06.264 --> 05:07.474
No problem, ma'am.

05:07.474 --> 05:09.518
You know, we are gonna drive

05:09.518 --> 05:11.228
right by that farmers market.

05:11.228 --> 05:13.480
You ever had their peaches?

05:13.480 --> 05:15.232
Don't think so.

05:15.232 --> 05:17.234
Well, then we have to stop.

05:17.234 --> 05:19.236
I'm gonna buy you a peach.

05:19.236 --> 05:20.987
You really don't have to.

05:20.987 --> 05:22.280
I insist.

05:22.280 --> 05:23.365
And then we'll

05:23.365 --> 05:25.116
swing by Braum's
so I can pick up

05:25.116 --> 05:25.992
some whipped cream.

05:25.992 --> 05:28.995
That goes great with peaches.

05:28.995 --> 05:30.664
Okay.

05:31.456 --> 05:33.708
Thank you for letting us know.

05:33.708 --> 05:35.669
Uh, I will speak to him.

05:35.669 --> 05:37.921
Sorry for the trouble.

05:37.921 --> 05:39.548
Bye.

05:40.507 --> 05:42.384
What's going on?

05:42.384 --> 05:43.969
That was Dr. Linkletter.

05:43.969 --> 05:47.264
He says that Sheldon is spending
too much time with him.

05:47.264 --> 05:49.057
Better him than us, right?

05:49.057 --> 05:51.685
(sighs)
He's suggesting that Sheldon

05:51.685 --> 05:54.271
try and find some friends
on campus.

05:54.271 --> 05:55.397
Makes sense.

05:55.397 --> 05:56.690
I'm just worried that

05:56.690 --> 05:58.108
he's gonna be hanging out
with people

05:58.108 --> 06:00.527
who are drinking
and going to parties.

06:00.527 --> 06:03.905
Like he's gonna make friends
with the cool kids.

06:05.407 --> 06:06.825
(crickets chirping)

06:06.825 --> 06:08.952
You still dating
that young guy?

06:08.952 --> 06:10.036
Justin?

06:10.036 --> 06:12.706
Oh, yeah.
It wasn't just to bug Dale.

06:12.706 --> 06:14.207
He's hot.

06:14.833 --> 06:16.960
And he doesn't eat dinner
at 5:00.

06:16.960 --> 06:19.045
Dale and I once ate dinner
at 3:30.

06:19.045 --> 06:21.548
I still think it was lunch.

06:21.548 --> 06:22.507
(laughs)

06:22.507 --> 06:24.092
Hey, you got any plans

06:24.092 --> 06:26.636
this weekend?
I don't think so. Why?

06:26.636 --> 06:29.347
I happen to have a coupon
for a free room

06:29.347 --> 06:31.725
at the Royale Casino.

06:31.725 --> 06:33.727
Now you're talking!

06:33.727 --> 06:35.186
How'd you swing that?

06:35.186 --> 06:39.107
Well, you lose enough,
they give you all kinds of crap.

06:39.107 --> 06:40.650
I'm in.

06:40.650 --> 06:42.068
And if you
really feel like gambling,

06:42.068 --> 06:44.237
they got an all-you-can-eat
seafood buffet.

06:44.237 --> 06:47.073
Put enough drinks in me,
I'll eat anything.

06:47.073 --> 06:48.199
(laughs)

06:49.326 --> 06:51.411
Wil Wheaton's cute.

06:51.411 --> 06:54.331
If you like him, then you
should watch Star Trek with me.

06:54.331 --> 06:55.749
He's not that cute.

06:55.749 --> 06:59.002
Shelly, I was looking
at your college catalog.

06:59.002 --> 07:01.004
There are a lot of fun clubs.

07:01.004 --> 07:03.256
Might be a nice way
to make some new friends.

07:03.256 --> 07:06.468
I don't need friends.
I have Dr. Linkletter.

07:06.468 --> 07:08.261
And he's fun, but...

07:08.261 --> 07:10.847
did you know that there's
a Science Fiction Club?

07:10.847 --> 07:12.766
You like science fiction.

07:12.766 --> 07:14.768
I prefer science fact.

07:14.768 --> 07:18.271
Then maybe you might enjoy
the Astronomy Club.

07:18.271 --> 07:19.814
Outer space and such.

07:19.814 --> 07:22.275
Ooh. You can meet other people
from your planet.

07:22.275 --> 07:23.568
Read your magazine.

07:23.568 --> 07:26.488
Why are you so interested
in me joining a club?

07:26.488 --> 07:28.156
I just want to make sure

07:28.156 --> 07:30.617
that you get
the full college experience.

07:30.617 --> 07:34.412
I suppose my so-called peers
could benefit from my presence.

07:34.412 --> 07:36.331
And you might benefit, too.

07:36.331 --> 07:38.708
A nice thought,
but I don't spread my sunshine

07:38.708 --> 07:39.959
for selfish reasons.

07:39.959 --> 07:41.294
Give me the catalog.

07:44.089 --> 07:46.174
You tried,
and that's what counts.

07:56.351 --> 07:58.144
Hello, lunch friend.

07:58.144 --> 07:59.813
Hi, Sheldon.

07:59.813 --> 08:01.648
Egg salad. Stinky.

08:01.648 --> 08:02.732
What do you want?

08:02.732 --> 08:04.025
I have some bad news.

08:04.025 --> 08:05.527
I'm going to join
a club on campus,

08:05.527 --> 08:07.487
which means we won't be able
to have lunch together.

08:07.487 --> 08:08.905
Wonderful!

08:08.905 --> 08:10.615
For you. Sad for me.

08:10.615 --> 08:12.117
Mmm. Happy trails.

08:12.117 --> 08:13.827
Oh, no, we're
still having lunch today.

08:13.827 --> 08:16.413
You get to help me decide
which club I should join.

08:16.413 --> 08:17.622
Terrific.

08:17.622 --> 08:18.665
ADULT SHELDON:
For some reason,

08:18.665 --> 08:20.375
Dr. Linkletter felt it was

08:20.375 --> 08:22.669
important that I start my quest
to join a club immediately.

08:22.669 --> 08:25.380
The interview process
was tougher than you'd expect.

08:25.380 --> 08:28.258
So why exactly should
I join your club?

08:28.258 --> 08:31.219
Well, cool people,
good chess players,

08:31.219 --> 08:33.847
and when the weather's nice,
we meet in the quad.

08:33.847 --> 08:35.640
Outside?
Yes.

08:35.640 --> 08:37.684
Under trees?
Yes.

08:37.684 --> 08:39.561
Where birds live?
Yes.

08:39.561 --> 08:40.895
I think we're done here.

08:40.895 --> 08:42.230
So, what kind
of activities

08:42.230 --> 08:44.190
does the Science Fiction
Club engage in?

08:44.190 --> 08:45.775
Well, this Friday
we're having a screening

08:45.775 --> 08:47.152
of Star Wars on laser disc.

08:47.152 --> 08:48.862
I thought this was
the Science Fiction Club.

08:48.862 --> 08:51.114
It is.
Star Wars is science fantasy.

08:51.114 --> 08:52.741
The Force is basically magic.

08:52.741 --> 08:55.326
At that point, you might as well
be watching The Hobbit.

08:55.326 --> 08:56.494
That's next week.

08:56.494 --> 08:58.371
This is madness.

08:58.371 --> 09:01.624
Proposition: the newest member
of the Debate Club

09:01.624 --> 09:03.126
should be Sheldon Cooper.

09:03.126 --> 09:05.044
You're the affirmative. Go.

09:05.044 --> 09:06.254
Who's Sheldon Cooper?

09:06.254 --> 09:07.714
Me. And I believe
I should not

09:07.714 --> 09:09.048
join the debate team
because there are

09:09.048 --> 09:11.468
far more valuable uses
of my time.

09:11.468 --> 09:13.052
Do you want to join or not?

09:13.052 --> 09:14.596
That's the debate, isn't it?

09:14.596 --> 09:16.681
I don't know what's happening.

09:16.681 --> 09:18.933
If you're thrown for a loop,
wait until you hear my rebuttal.

09:18.933 --> 09:21.144
Sheldon Cooper
should not join the debate team

09:21.144 --> 09:23.938
because your leadership
is clearly questionable.

09:23.938 --> 09:25.899
Okay, you're not in the club.

09:25.899 --> 09:28.109
Ha! I win. Wait.

09:28.902 --> 09:31.029
(pager beeping, vibrating)

09:32.405 --> 09:34.157
(horse neighs on TV)

09:34.157 --> 09:36.785
Aren't you gonna
call them back?
No.

09:36.785 --> 09:38.244
It's this old lady.
She keeps getting me

09:38.244 --> 09:40.622
to run her errands
and do her chores.

09:40.622 --> 09:41.956
You don't even
do that here.

09:41.956 --> 09:43.625
I know.
(pager beeping, vibrating)

09:43.625 --> 09:45.126
She's not your grandma.

09:45.126 --> 09:47.378
Just call her
back and say no.

09:48.379 --> 09:50.131
You're right.

09:51.508 --> 09:54.594
Thanks again.
Uh-huh.

09:54.594 --> 09:56.930
What're you gonna do
with all these plants?

09:56.930 --> 09:58.807
Put them in my garden.

09:58.807 --> 10:01.392
Sounds like a lot of work.

10:03.311 --> 10:05.313
Aw, man.

10:05.313 --> 10:08.942
(chuckles)
So, why are you taking me
instead of Dale?

10:08.942 --> 10:11.236
Well, last time he and I
went casino hopping,

10:11.236 --> 10:12.946
it didn't work out too hot.

10:12.946 --> 10:15.114
'Cause he proposed
and you said no?

10:15.114 --> 10:17.492
Why would he tell you that?!
Hey,

10:17.492 --> 10:20.453
don't feel bad. I'm the dummy
that said yes to him.

10:20.453 --> 10:22.413
Well, I guess
you got a point there.

10:22.413 --> 10:24.541
(chuckles) Oh!
("Crazy" by Patsy Cline playing)

10:24.541 --> 10:25.542
Turn it up. I love

10:25.542 --> 10:27.085
that song.

10:27.085 --> 10:29.796
(singing along):
♪ Crazy ♪

10:29.796 --> 10:34.467
♪ I'm crazy for feeling ♪

10:34.467 --> 10:36.135
♪ So lonely ♪

10:36.135 --> 10:39.722
You know,
they got karaoke at the lounge.

10:39.722 --> 10:43.977
♪ I'm crazy ♪

10:43.977 --> 10:47.772
(off-key):
♪ Crazy for feeling ♪

10:47.772 --> 10:50.650
♪ So blue ♪

10:50.650 --> 10:51.776
Wow.

10:51.776 --> 10:53.820
That's some voice you got.

10:53.820 --> 10:55.321
Thank you.

10:56.114 --> 10:59.033
(computer keys clacking)

11:03.162 --> 11:05.582
Sheldon, why are you at my desk?

11:05.582 --> 11:08.793
I like your keyboard. The ones
at the library are too clacky.

11:08.793 --> 11:11.129
I thought you were
going to join a club.
I tried,

11:11.129 --> 11:12.589
but they each had
their own problems.

11:12.589 --> 11:14.841
By chance,
were any of those problems you?

11:14.841 --> 11:17.010
You're so funny. I missed this.

11:17.010 --> 11:19.345
Would you like your seat back?

11:19.345 --> 11:20.471
Yes.

11:21.389 --> 11:23.516
I'd also like
my office back.

11:23.516 --> 11:24.893
What do you mean?

11:24.893 --> 11:28.062
Son, you can't just hang
out here whenever you want.

11:28.062 --> 11:29.856
Why not? We're friends.

11:29.856 --> 11:32.483
No. I'm a professor,
you're a student.

11:32.483 --> 11:33.526
I'm 68, you're 11.

11:33.526 --> 11:35.403
Do you see
where I'm headed here?

11:35.403 --> 11:37.030
Nope.

11:37.030 --> 11:39.032
Sheldon, I've tried to
be nice about this,

11:39.032 --> 11:40.158
but you're just not taking

11:40.158 --> 11:41.284
the hint. If you
have questions

11:41.284 --> 11:43.036
about class, I'm here.

11:43.036 --> 11:46.539
Otherwise,
please leave me alone.

11:48.708 --> 11:50.627
Uh, I understand.

11:50.627 --> 11:52.629
Thank you.

12:03.848 --> 12:07.185
I'm hurt Dr. Linkletter
doesn't want me as a friend.

12:07.185 --> 12:08.478
Understandable.

12:08.478 --> 12:09.854
I'm also angry.

12:09.854 --> 12:11.522
I don't like
having two feelings at once.

12:11.522 --> 12:12.649
It's annoying.

12:12.649 --> 12:14.609
Great, annoyed. That's three.

12:14.609 --> 12:16.319
I thought
you were gonna join a club.

12:16.319 --> 12:18.821
Too bad there isn't
a Dr. Linkletter Haters Club.

12:18.821 --> 12:20.531
I would join that
in a heartbeat.

12:20.531 --> 12:22.659
Maybe I should start one.

12:22.659 --> 12:25.495
Starting your own club
is an interesting idea.

12:25.495 --> 12:27.664
Maybe just not
one based on,

12:27.664 --> 12:30.208
you know, hating someone.

12:30.208 --> 12:31.542
You started that group at church

12:31.542 --> 12:33.169
for parents
who hate The Simpsons.

12:33.169 --> 12:35.505
It's not about hate.
We just write letters

12:35.505 --> 12:36.923
to get it taken off the air.

12:36.923 --> 12:39.759
(chuckles): And it's
gonna happen any day now.

12:39.759 --> 12:41.177
ADULT SHELDON:
Ironically,

12:41.177 --> 12:43.388
the only Simpson she did like
was O.J.

12:43.388 --> 12:46.099
Time's funny that way.

12:46.891 --> 12:49.519
Whoever decided
to put video poker

12:49.519 --> 12:51.771
in the bar is a genius.

12:51.771 --> 12:53.398
If they change the seats out
to toilets,

12:53.398 --> 12:55.233
we'd never have to leave.

12:55.233 --> 12:57.276
(both laughing)

12:58.194 --> 13:02.198
So, what else has Dale told you
about our relationship?

13:02.198 --> 13:04.242
You still hung up on that?

13:04.242 --> 13:05.660
Apparently.

13:05.660 --> 13:07.203
You know, I don't
think he meant to.

13:07.203 --> 13:09.914
We were having a drink, and
it just kind of slipped out.

13:09.914 --> 13:12.125
Y'all still go out
drinking together?

13:12.125 --> 13:15.128
It was our grandson's
elementary school graduation,

13:15.128 --> 13:16.462
so yeah.

13:16.462 --> 13:18.423
I didn't know
y'all were that close.

13:18.423 --> 13:20.299
Are you jealous?

13:20.299 --> 13:22.218
No.
Sounds like it.

13:22.218 --> 13:23.720
Well...

13:24.721 --> 13:28.182
You ever sleep with him
after the divorce?

13:28.182 --> 13:29.559
Gross! No.

13:29.559 --> 13:32.186
That cranky bag of wrinkles
is all yours.

13:32.186 --> 13:33.730
That's a comfort.

13:33.730 --> 13:35.648
(laughs):
I guess.

13:36.941 --> 13:38.317
Well, now that
we're being honest,

13:38.317 --> 13:40.570
can I ask you a question?
Sure.

13:40.570 --> 13:43.072
Do you regret
saying no to Dale?

13:44.073 --> 13:45.533
No.

13:46.284 --> 13:48.953
There was a little pause there.

13:48.953 --> 13:50.455
There was not!

13:50.455 --> 13:52.040
Okay, I believe you.

13:52.040 --> 13:53.249
Thank you.

13:53.249 --> 13:54.250
You see how I paused?

13:54.250 --> 13:56.836
That means I was lying.

13:56.836 --> 13:58.588
SHELDON:
Missy,

13:58.588 --> 14:00.923
has your social experience
in middle school

14:00.923 --> 14:01.758
been going well?

14:01.758 --> 14:03.426
So good, it's nuts.

14:03.426 --> 14:05.470
Are you a member of any clubs?

14:05.470 --> 14:07.096
Well, in the cafeteria,
we call our table

14:07.096 --> 14:08.973
Heather M.
and the Funky Lunch Bunch.

14:08.973 --> 14:11.267
Well, I meant
school-sanctioned clubs.

14:11.267 --> 14:13.394
The F.L.B. is a pretty big deal.

14:13.394 --> 14:14.937
I don't get why people think

14:14.937 --> 14:17.398
that the social aspect
of education is so important.

14:17.398 --> 14:20.777
Maybe 'cause the education
aspect is so boring.

14:20.777 --> 14:22.487
But that's the whole point
of school.

14:22.487 --> 14:24.197
Eh.
I'll stick with being popular.

14:24.197 --> 14:25.782
ADULT SHELDON:
I'd like to point out

14:25.782 --> 14:27.867
that one of us
has a Nobel Prize.

14:27.867 --> 14:30.119
All the other one has
is a loving family and friends,

14:30.119 --> 14:34.457
which I also have.
Boy, did I win!

14:38.127 --> 14:40.838
This is it. I'm done.

14:41.631 --> 14:42.757
Oh, hi.

14:42.757 --> 14:45.927
You must be Georgie.
Uh, yeah.

14:45.927 --> 14:48.638
My nana says you've been
taking such good care of her.

14:48.638 --> 14:50.807
(chuckles):
You're so sweet.

14:50.807 --> 14:53.476
Thanks, but she's the sweet one.

14:53.476 --> 14:55.269
Isn't she?
(chuckles)

14:55.269 --> 14:57.188
Nana, Georgie's here!

14:57.188 --> 14:59.816
MILDRED:
Ask him if he wants
to stay for dinner.

14:59.816 --> 15:02.151
I'm free. What're we having?

15:04.153 --> 15:06.364

15:43.609 --> 15:45.153
MEEMAW:
One of us does.

15:45.153 --> 15:46.696
ADULT SHELDON:
The next day,

15:46.696 --> 15:48.447
I set out to start my own club.

15:48.447 --> 15:51.033
It involved science, education

15:51.033 --> 15:55.454
and all the glitz and glamour
of show business.

15:55.454 --> 15:58.082
All I had to do was sit back

15:58.082 --> 16:02.962
and wait for my new Proton posse
to come rolling in.

16:10.011 --> 16:12.221
Greetings,
fellow Professor Proton fan.

16:12.221 --> 16:13.723
Oh, I thought
this room was empty.

16:13.723 --> 16:15.224
Well, it's not.
This is a meeting

16:15.224 --> 16:17.226
of the Professor Proton
Appreciation Club.

16:17.226 --> 16:19.228
Would you like
to fill out an application?

16:19.228 --> 16:21.480
I'm just looking
for someplace quiet.

16:21.480 --> 16:23.024
I understand.

16:23.024 --> 16:24.942
Well, it doesn't look
like anyone's gonna show up,

16:24.942 --> 16:28.070
so if you would like
to read here, you're welcome to.

16:29.071 --> 16:30.823
Okay.

16:33.576 --> 16:35.077
I was only starting this club

16:35.077 --> 16:37.121
because my mother
wanted me to make some friends.

16:37.121 --> 16:38.581
Not just her.

16:38.581 --> 16:40.041
It started
with my physics professor,

16:40.041 --> 16:42.251
Dr. Linkletter,
who I thought was my friend

16:42.251 --> 16:44.253
but then decided...
Are you gonna keep talking?

16:44.253 --> 16:46.422
I-I've got a book.

16:46.422 --> 16:49.467
ADULT SHELDON:
That day, the Read
in Silence Club was born.

16:49.467 --> 16:51.928
Its members were me
and my new friend...

16:51.928 --> 16:54.138
What's your name?
Shh.

16:54.138 --> 16:56.432
ADULT SHELDON:
And my new friend, that guy.

17:02.230 --> 17:03.731
(phone ringing)

17:06.317 --> 17:08.611
Make it stop.

17:10.363 --> 17:11.864
(chuckles):
Oh.

17:13.324 --> 17:15.660
Who the hell is this?

17:15.660 --> 17:17.995
Hey. Morning, sunshine.

17:17.995 --> 17:20.122
What time is it?

17:20.122 --> 17:21.582
2:00 in the afternoon.

17:22.333 --> 17:23.751
Really?

17:23.751 --> 17:26.212
Well, I mean,
you had a wild night singing

17:26.212 --> 17:28.339
and everything.
How do you know that?

17:28.339 --> 17:30.258
You called me
at 3:00 in the morning.
(whispers): Do you remember

17:30.258 --> 17:32.134
me calling Dale last night?

17:32.134 --> 17:33.386
No.

17:33.386 --> 17:35.930
(rock music playing)
Do it! Call him! Do it!

17:35.930 --> 17:39.225
Call him! (whoops)
And I know exactly what
I'm gonna say.

17:39.225 --> 17:40.309
(laughs)

17:40.309 --> 17:41.477
What'd I say?

17:41.477 --> 17:42.812
You don't remember?

17:43.646 --> 17:44.897
And then I lost

17:44.897 --> 17:47.191
$20 at the video poker bar,

17:47.191 --> 17:50.611
and then we sang karaoke.
Tell him about the shrimp.

17:50.611 --> 17:53.489
(laughs)
(chuckles): We went
to the all-you-can-eat buffet,

17:53.489 --> 17:56.492
you know,
and they had these jumbo shrimp.

17:56.492 --> 17:57.952
(laughs):
And, I mean, they weren't

17:57.952 --> 18:01.747
just saying they were jumbo.
So big!

18:01.747 --> 18:03.708
Are you gonna tell me
what I said or not?

18:03.708 --> 18:06.794
Hell no.
I'm having too much fun.

18:06.794 --> 18:09.255
I hate you.
(Dale chuckles)

18:09.255 --> 18:10.589
I can live with that.
