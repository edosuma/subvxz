01:23.584 --> 01:24.885
How’s the research
going, Balki?

01:24.918 --> 01:26.687
Great, cousin.

01:26.720 --> 01:28.421
What have you got
on Carl Sandburg?

01:28.454 --> 01:30.156
Uh, nothing yet.

01:30.190 --> 01:31.558
Well,
what about Robert Frost?

01:31.592 --> 01:33.259
He’s next.

01:33.293 --> 01:34.861
Well,
then what’s all this?

01:34.895 --> 01:38.131
This is all
about Lowell Kelly.

01:38.164 --> 01:39.232
Balki, I just needed

01:39.265 --> 01:40.433
a little background
on the poets

01:40.466 --> 01:41.702
whose manuscripts
are being auctioned

01:41.735 --> 01:43.269
tomorrow night
at Beardsley’s.

01:43.303 --> 01:44.605
Don’t waste too much time
with Lowell Kelly.

01:44.638 --> 01:46.372
He’s a minor poet.

01:46.406 --> 01:47.708
Minor?

01:47.741 --> 01:50.110
You mean, his mama
had to give him permission?

01:52.278 --> 01:55.882
No, I‐I mean, compared to
poets like, Sandburg and Frost

01:55.916 --> 01:58.484
Kelly’s work
isn’t very good.

01:58.519 --> 02:01.387
Cousin,
I beg to take issue.

02:01.421 --> 02:02.422
I love Lowell Kelly.

02:02.455 --> 02:04.858
And‐and now that I know
so much more about him

02:04.891 --> 02:06.359
I love him even more.

02:06.392 --> 02:09.729
Did you know that he
used to hide his poems?

02:09.763 --> 02:11.565
That’s what I’d do
with them.

02:13.233 --> 02:15.602
He always said
that it was an extension

02:15.636 --> 02:18.338
of the hidden meaning
in his poetry.

02:18.371 --> 02:21.608
And one time, his editor
had to go on a scavenger hunt

02:21.642 --> 02:22.943
to find the poems.

02:22.976 --> 02:25.445
Well, Balki, my editor’s gonna
be hunting for my replacement

02:25.478 --> 02:27.480
if I don’t get
this story in on time.

02:27.514 --> 02:31.417
Question, why would anybody
hunt for scavengers?

02:33.353 --> 02:35.522
I mean, they’re‐they’re ugly.

02:37.658 --> 02:39.292
They smell bad.

02:40.326 --> 02:42.663
They’re not
very good eating.

a very young buzzard.

02:46.366 --> 02:47.668
You know, years back

02:47.701 --> 02:49.636

an excellent recipe

02:49.670 --> 02:52.272
for baby buzzard
with basil.

02:53.540 --> 02:55.241
Alright, I think you
need to take a break.

02:55.275 --> 02:56.176
You accidentally wrote down

02:56.209 --> 02:58.545
that Lowell Kelly
lived at our address.

02:58.579 --> 02:59.780
I did?

03:01.014 --> 03:03.650
Cousin, I did not
make a mistake.

03:03.684 --> 03:04.785
Look this.

03:04.818 --> 03:06.987
Lowell Kelly used to live
at our address

03:07.020 --> 03:08.955
"711 Coldwell Avenue."

03:10.591 --> 03:13.960
And not only that,
but he lived in apartment 209.

03:13.994 --> 03:15.428
That’s our apartment!

03:15.461 --> 03:17.931
Well, that’s incredible.

03:17.964 --> 03:19.800
But, do you know
what that means?

03:19.833 --> 03:22.235
I’m still the best writer
who ever lived in our apartment.

03:24.304 --> 03:25.606
It also means

03:25.639 --> 03:27.273
that Lowell Kelly’s last poem

03:27.307 --> 03:29.776
is hidden
somewhere in our apartment.

03:29.810 --> 03:31.477
Well, I say
we do the world a favor

03:31.512 --> 03:32.713
and let it stay hidden.

03:32.746 --> 03:33.980
Come on,
let’s go to lunch.

03:34.014 --> 03:37.684
Oh, cousin, I‐I know you don’t
think much of Lowell Kelly

03:37.718 --> 03:39.452
but some other
people do.

03:39.485 --> 03:43.557
Listen to this, in 1974,
a Lowell Kelly manuscript

03:43.590 --> 03:45.726
sold for $5,000.

03:46.793 --> 03:47.961
$5,000?

03:47.994 --> 03:50.831
Isn’t that disgusting?

03:50.864 --> 03:53.600
Putting a price tag
on a work of art.

03:53.634 --> 03:56.870
It’s like painting chest hairs
on the Mona Lisa.

03:58.639 --> 04:00.841
Five thousand dollars
for a poem?

04:00.874 --> 04:04.310
If it had been signed,
it would be 10,000.

04:04.344 --> 04:06.513
Uh, you know, Balki,
I think I may have to

04:06.547 --> 04:07.447
work through lunch.

04:07.480 --> 04:09.015
Could you get me
a corned beef sandwich.

04:09.049 --> 04:11.518
I‐I’ve gotta run this
up to the city desk.

04:11.552 --> 04:14.521
Okay, cousin,
one corned beef, very lean

04:14.555 --> 04:16.557

and slice diagonally

04:26.600 --> 04:28.001
Yes, this is Larry Appleton

04:28.034 --> 04:29.936
from the Chicago Chronicle
again.

04:29.970 --> 04:33.006
Yeah, you know,
I‐I heard somewhere

04:33.039 --> 04:36.777
that an original unpublished
Lowell Kelly manuscript

04:36.810 --> 04:40.647
brought in $5,000 in 1974.

04:40.681 --> 04:43.917
Uh, what would
one go for these days?

04:46.019 --> 04:48.555

my Myposian microwave cookbook

05:09.643 --> 05:13.479

05:13.514 --> 05:16.016

get behind the sink?

05:16.049 --> 05:17.483
Yeah.

05:17.518 --> 05:19.820
You know, cousin

05:19.853 --> 05:20.954
I can’t help noticing

05:20.987 --> 05:23.023
that I’m
doing all the work

05:23.056 --> 05:25.125
and you’re doing
all the...

05:25.158 --> 05:27.427
...whatever it is
you’re doing.

05:29.830 --> 05:31.998
All the work?
All the work?

05:32.032 --> 05:34.535
Balki, who went
all the way downtown

05:34.568 --> 05:36.369
to get the blueprints?

05:36.402 --> 05:37.270
You did.

05:37.303 --> 05:39.773
Who stood in line
for good ten minutes

05:39.806 --> 05:41.775
at the city planner’s
office?

05:43.076 --> 05:44.144
You did.

05:44.177 --> 05:47.714
Who left a five dollar deposit
for the blueprints?

05:50.416 --> 05:52.452
You’re right.

05:52.485 --> 05:54.454
I’m sorry
for being so petty.

05:56.957 --> 05:58.925
That’s okay.

05:58.959 --> 06:01.562
Cousin, I can’t believe you
will go to so much trouble

06:01.595 --> 06:02.896
to find
a Lowell Kelly poem

06:02.929 --> 06:05.532
when you consider him
such a minor league poet.

06:06.432 --> 06:07.601
That was
this morning, Balki.

06:07.634 --> 06:08.535
After our talk

06:08.569 --> 06:11.071
I realized
the true value of his poetry.

06:12.773 --> 06:14.675
How a few simple
lines on paper

06:14.708 --> 06:16.677
can enrich
a man’s life.

06:19.012 --> 06:20.547
Cousin,
isn’t it wonderful

06:20.581 --> 06:22.082
that we’re
going to find a poem

06:22.115 --> 06:24.718
that will bring the world
such happiness?

06:28.454 --> 06:30.957
Happiness. Right.
Okay.

06:30.991 --> 06:32.092
Let’s look
at the mantelpiece.

06:32.125 --> 06:35.696
Maybe there’s a loose tile,
a secret compartment.

06:38.131 --> 06:40.100
[sighs]

06:43.169 --> 06:44.905
You know, cousin

06:44.938 --> 06:48.441
Uh, on Mypos, whenever I had
anything I that I wanted to hide

06:48.474 --> 06:51.778
that was valuable, I used to
just shove it up the chimney.

06:54.114 --> 06:57.818
‐Shove it up the chimney?
‐Just shove it up the chimney.

06:57.851 --> 07:00.453
Well, this isn’t Mypos,
so we can eliminate the chimney.

07:00.486 --> 07:03.624
Cousin, it wouldn’t kill you
to look up the chimney.

07:05.491 --> 07:07.427
Alright.
I’ll look up the chimney.

07:14.935 --> 07:16.069
Balki.

07:16.102 --> 07:17.738
There’s something here.

07:17.771 --> 07:19.172
Balki,
hand me the poker.

07:19.205 --> 07:20.874
Uh, cousin, no, no,
it’s not a good idea

07:20.907 --> 07:22.843
to go poking up
in a chimney.

07:22.876 --> 07:25.846
Balki, I know what I’m doing.
Hand me the poker.

07:25.879 --> 07:27.480
‐Cousin, no‐‐
‐Balki‐‐

07:27.514 --> 07:28.949
No. I know. I know more...

07:28.982 --> 07:30.050

about chimneys...

‐No.

up the chicky...

[speaking in foreign language]

07:58.845 --> 08:01.948
There’s something stuck
to the side of the chimney.

08:01.982 --> 08:05.819
[grumbling]
Play with the fireplace...

08:05.852 --> 08:08.054
If I can just...

08:08.088 --> 08:09.890
...pry it loose...

08:09.923 --> 08:11.558
Yeah.

08:11.592 --> 08:12.826
I’m getting it!

08:12.859 --> 08:14.094
I’m getting it!

08:14.127 --> 08:15.696
I’ve got it!

08:55.802 --> 08:57.671
You know, um

08:57.704 --> 08:58.572
one of the reasons

08:58.605 --> 09:00.974
it makes such an excellent
hiding place

09:01.007 --> 09:04.244
is no one in
their right mind...

09:06.346 --> 09:08.749
...would go poking up
inside it.

09:22.629 --> 09:24.831
Boy, I was lucky.

09:24.865 --> 09:29.035
I could have been hit
in the head with this brick.

09:29.069 --> 09:31.037
Or worse

09:31.071 --> 09:33.039
with this tin box.

09:44.317 --> 09:45.318

09:48.021 --> 09:49.122
Do you know
what this is?

09:49.155 --> 09:50.824
It’s a tin box.

09:50.857 --> 09:52.893
This isn’t
just a tin box.

09:52.926 --> 09:55.095
We found
the Lowell Kelly poem.

10:01.434 --> 10:04.137

10:09.710 --> 10:10.911
Here it is.

10:12.345 --> 10:14.981
Get ready to hear
Lowell Kelly’s last poem.

10:16.683 --> 10:18.318
"Roses are red,
violets are blue

10:18.351 --> 10:21.287
"If you want my poem,
here’s what you do."

10:25.325 --> 10:27.360
Yeah. Yeah.

10:29.730 --> 10:30.831
That’s Kelly.

10:32.866 --> 10:35.235
The man was a genius.

10:35.268 --> 10:39.039
I don’t know why he fell
into disfavor in the sixties?

10:39.072 --> 10:41.975
Balki,
this isn’t the poem.

10:42.008 --> 10:43.710
If it is not
the poem what is it?

10:43.744 --> 10:44.911
Balki,
these are instructions

10:44.945 --> 10:47.213
for finding the poem.

10:47.247 --> 10:48.915
We’re nearing the pot of gold
at the end of the rainbow.

10:50.984 --> 10:54.087
Did you say "gold"?

10:55.221 --> 10:58.091
‐Gold?
‐Yes.

10:58.124 --> 10:59.726
Why would I say "gold"?

11:00.426 --> 11:03.163
I don’t know.

11:03.196 --> 11:05.331
There’s no money
involved in this.

11:05.365 --> 11:06.432
Aren’t we doing this

11:06.466 --> 11:09.335
to bring the world
happiness?

11:13.273 --> 11:15.241
Happiness. Right.

11:15.275 --> 11:17.277
Now, help me
find the poem.

11:18.512 --> 11:20.113
"From the front door
with zest

11:20.146 --> 11:22.749
first you take
ten paces west."

11:27.954 --> 11:29.956
"From the front door,
ten paces west.

11:29.990 --> 11:33.259
‐It says with zest.
‐With zest. Ten paces.

11:33.293 --> 11:36.462
One, two, three four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

11:38.164 --> 11:40.466
"Five paces north,
now five more east.

11:40.500 --> 11:43.103
"You’re getting close
to a poetry feast."

11:43.136 --> 11:44.738
Five paces north.

11:48.274 --> 11:50.911
One, two,
three, four, five.

11:50.944 --> 11:52.378
"Now five more east."

11:53.980 --> 11:56.082
One, two, three,
four, five.

11:58.084 --> 12:00.754
"Six paces south.
Please be meticulous."

12:00.787 --> 12:03.189
Of course we will.
Don’t be ridiculous.

12:09.062 --> 12:10.864
Six paces south.

12:10.897 --> 12:14.134
One, two, three,
four, five, six.

12:15.502 --> 12:17.237
Balki,
I don’t understand.

12:17.270 --> 12:19.039
We’re supposed to take
six paces south.

12:19.072 --> 12:20.373
We’ve only taken five.

12:20.406 --> 12:22.509
Perhaps Kelly
had short legs.

12:24.244 --> 12:25.445
Wait a minute.

12:29.916 --> 12:32.085
Balki, this wall
shouldn’t be here.

12:32.118 --> 12:33.419
Cousin,
I think you’re right.

12:33.453 --> 12:34.888
If this wall were gone

12:34.921 --> 12:37.023
it would really
open up the space

12:37.057 --> 12:39.826
and make kind
of a‐a Santa Fe statement.

12:39.860 --> 12:41.427
No. No, no, Balki.

12:41.461 --> 12:43.564
I mean, this wall
wasn’t here

12:43.597 --> 12:45.331
when Lowell Kelly
lived here.

12:45.365 --> 12:47.033
We need to take one more pace
in that direction.

12:47.067 --> 12:49.035
I’m going
into the closet.

12:51.538 --> 12:53.173
’Six!’

12:53.206 --> 12:55.976
’This is the final
instruction.’

12:56.009 --> 12:57.844
’"Five paces east,
and you will be’

12:57.878 --> 12:59.279
’"in the presence
of poetry."’

12:59.312 --> 13:01.047
One, two, three, four.

13:01.081 --> 13:04.117
Balki, the poem is hidden
in your bedroom.

13:05.619 --> 13:07.487
Come on, Balki.
Let’s find the...

13:13.293 --> 13:15.128
You know...

13:15.161 --> 13:18.364
...every time I come in here
it’s just a little...

13:19.966 --> 13:21.034
...busier.

13:23.069 --> 13:24.137
Thank you, cousin.

13:24.170 --> 13:28.341
I‐I like to think of my room
as a work in progress.

13:28.374 --> 13:30.944
Speaking of which there’s
something I want to show you.

13:30.977 --> 13:32.979
Come over here.
And move here.

13:47.160 --> 13:48.361
Well.

13:50.631 --> 13:51.998
Balki.

13:56.603 --> 13:58.004
It’s big.

13:59.272 --> 14:01.542
I‐I’ve been staying up
late nights

14:01.575 --> 14:02.676
working on it.

14:02.709 --> 14:06.312
It’s a depiction
of the birth of our friendship.

14:09.583 --> 14:12.018
Well, of‐of course.

14:12.052 --> 14:15.021
And, uh, this would be you
over here.

14:15.055 --> 14:17.558
The sandals
give me away, huh?

14:19.392 --> 14:22.295
And this person
with no lips...

14:24.330 --> 14:26.933
...would be me.

14:26.967 --> 14:30.571
Well, that’s
very nice, Balki.

14:30.604 --> 14:33.273
Now come on.
Let’s see if we can find‐‐

14:33.306 --> 14:36.276
Cousin, cousin,
I’m so, I’m so happy you like it

14:36.309 --> 14:39.145
because I put
my heart and soul

14:39.179 --> 14:42.148
and six months of sleepless
nights into painting it.

14:44.484 --> 14:46.687
Actually,
there was one night

14:46.720 --> 14:49.322
when I fell asleep
against the mural.

14:51.558 --> 14:54.060
You see this sheep
that looks like a nose?

14:59.065 --> 15:02.102
It‐it‐it is my nose.

15:04.304 --> 15:07.473
Well, it’s a good,
good painting.

15:07.508 --> 15:10.410
But we have
a poem to find, huh?

15:10.443 --> 15:13.580
Now, let’s get
all this stuff off the shelves.

15:13.614 --> 15:15.616
Cousin, cousin,
wait, wait, wait!

15:15.649 --> 15:17.050
Wait a minute.

15:17.083 --> 15:18.952
You were, you were
about to touch

15:18.985 --> 15:22.422
a rare complete set
of Moogli carvings.

15:22.455 --> 15:25.158
Okay. You move them.
But, let’s hurry it up.

15:25.191 --> 15:27.160
Okay. Okay.

15:27.193 --> 15:29.362
Zygote, I’m going
to take you down now.

15:29.395 --> 15:32.165
I’m gonna take you down.
Shh, shh, no, no.

15:32.198 --> 15:33.499
That’s my hand.
That’s my hand.

15:33.534 --> 15:35.502
Don’t look down.
Don’t look down.

15:36.703 --> 15:38.639
Eye contact, eye contact.

15:38.672 --> 15:40.040
Eye contact.

15:41.775 --> 15:43.376
See me.

15:43.409 --> 15:44.678
Hear me.

15:44.711 --> 15:46.580
Feel me.

15:46.613 --> 15:48.048
Okay, okay, okay.

15:48.081 --> 15:49.282
There’s the back legs

15:49.315 --> 15:51.017
and there’s the four hoofs.

15:51.051 --> 15:52.352
Okay.

15:52.385 --> 15:53.620
Okay.

15:57.423 --> 15:59.192
Okay , Zina‐‐

15:59.225 --> 16:02.529
Say, Balki, uh, don’t you have
a class to go to?

16:02.563 --> 16:05.198
Well, well, I already decided
I’m not going tonight.

16:05.231 --> 16:06.466
You’re not?

16:06.499 --> 16:08.769
No, no, I want to help you
find the poem.

16:08.802 --> 16:10.537
Well, I’m shocked.

16:10.571 --> 16:13.206
Uh, don’t you realize there are
people all over the world

16:13.239 --> 16:15.776
who would do anything for
the educational opportunities

16:15.809 --> 16:17.711
that have been
just handed to you.

16:17.744 --> 16:20.614
Is this the way you show
your gratitude, is it?

16:20.647 --> 16:21.882
By skipping class?

16:21.915 --> 16:24.551
But‐but‐but, cousin, I’m only
gonna do it just this once.

16:24.585 --> 16:25.719
Oh, sure, that’s
what you say now

16:25.752 --> 16:29.122
but, uh, soon it’ll be
twice a week, three times a week

16:29.155 --> 16:31.357
a whole semester.

16:31.391 --> 16:32.526
Pretty soon
you’ll have forgotten

16:32.559 --> 16:35.161
the pledge of allegiance.

16:35.195 --> 16:37.230
Cousin,
I would never do that.

16:37.263 --> 16:39.232
‐Then you better go to class.
‐Okay.

16:39.265 --> 16:40.534
Don’t worry.

16:40.567 --> 16:42.769
I won’t look for the poem
till you get back.

16:42.803 --> 16:45.205
Okay.
Thank you, cousin.

16:51.344 --> 16:54.280
[instrumental music]

17:01.822 --> 17:03.757
[chain saw starts]

17:34.420 --> 17:36.389
[panting]

17:36.422 --> 17:37.490
Balki.

17:40.727 --> 17:43.429
I didn’t
hear you come in.

17:43.463 --> 17:45.766
What have you done?

17:46.667 --> 17:48.301
Oh. Well...

17:50.671 --> 17:51.838
Just thought I’d get
a jump on things.

17:51.872 --> 17:54.474
No need to thank me.

17:54.508 --> 17:55.509
Balki.

17:56.643 --> 17:59.279
I know now
where the poem is.

18:01.181 --> 18:04.718
Where, cousin,
could it possibly be?

18:04.751 --> 18:07.320
You’ve torn up
every wall!

18:07.353 --> 18:10.290
The only place it could
possibly be is...

18:12.793 --> 18:14.628
No, cousin.

18:14.661 --> 18:16.630
No. No.

18:16.663 --> 18:18.632
Don’t
destroy my mural!

18:20.934 --> 18:22.503
Please, cousin.
Please, cousin.

18:22.536 --> 18:25.539
I put my heart and soul
and nose into it.

18:25.572 --> 18:27.508
Balki. Balki.

18:27.541 --> 18:29.242
You can paint it again.

18:29.275 --> 18:31.645
Think of how much better
it’ll be the second time around.

18:31.678 --> 18:33.847
Cousin, I can’t paint it
the second time.

18:33.880 --> 18:35.616
It was done
during my blue period

18:35.649 --> 18:38.852
and I think that’s passed.

18:38.885 --> 18:42.255
Balki, there is a manuscript
on the other side of that wall

18:42.288 --> 18:43.489
that is worth
a lot of money.

18:43.524 --> 18:45.425
I called Beardsley’s
and they told me

18:45.458 --> 18:49.329
we could get
$25,000 for that poem.

18:49.362 --> 18:53.299
So that’s why you’re
in my room with a chain saw.

18:55.435 --> 18:58.438
This isn’t about bringing
the world happiness.

18:58.471 --> 19:01.675
This is about bringing
Larry Appleton money.

19:03.443 --> 19:05.512
Wait, cousin!
Look around you.

19:05.546 --> 19:07.447
Wait!
Look what you’ve done.

19:07.480 --> 19:10.450
Stop,
in the name of love!

19:15.689 --> 19:18.725
Balki,
get out of my way.

19:23.429 --> 19:24.698
Okay, cousin.

19:26.667 --> 19:29.570
You can destroy my mural
if you want to.

19:29.603 --> 19:32.673
But just think
before you leap

19:32.706 --> 19:35.876
into your own
great gorge of greed.

19:35.909 --> 19:38.512
You might find the poem

19:38.545 --> 19:40.914
but you might lose
the part of Larry Appleton

19:40.947 --> 19:44.317
that cares more about people
than he does about money.

19:53.426 --> 19:55.395
[pound]

19:55.428 --> 19:57.363
[Larry laughing]

20:01.635 --> 20:02.736
(Larry)
’Aah.’

20:13.614 --> 20:17.584
Balki, I didn’t
destroy the mural.

20:20.020 --> 20:21.421
‐You didn’t?
‐Yeah.

20:21.454 --> 20:24.424
I just...couldn’t do it.

20:27.027 --> 20:29.262
Cousin, thank you,
thank you.

20:29.295 --> 20:30.631
I’m so happy.

20:32.498 --> 20:36.703
But why‐why were you
screaming?

20:36.737 --> 20:39.540
I dropped the sledge hammer
on my foot.

20:42.876 --> 20:44.611
Cousin, I’m
so proud of you.

20:44.645 --> 20:46.580
I didn’t do it
on purpose.

20:48.414 --> 20:49.883
No, I’m proud of you
for resisting

20:49.916 --> 20:51.852
the great gorge of greed.

20:52.919 --> 20:58.692
Yeah, I went off
the deep end again.

20:58.725 --> 20:59.760
And you know what it was?

20:59.793 --> 21:00.861
Just pure greed.

21:00.894 --> 21:04.665
It was just pure greed.

21:05.932 --> 21:07.000
You know, sometimes‐‐

21:07.033 --> 21:08.068
You just get greedy.

21:08.101 --> 21:09.503
I get greedy...

21:09.536 --> 21:10.837
You just lose control.

21:10.871 --> 21:12.372
And I lose it.

21:12.405 --> 21:14.575
I‐I lose control.

21:16.510 --> 21:17.711
But you know what, cousin?

21:17.744 --> 21:18.912
Look on the bright side?

21:18.945 --> 21:22.482
Look on the bright side.

21:22.516 --> 21:25.385
You were lured to the edge
of the great gorge of greed

21:25.418 --> 21:27.387
but you didn’t fall in.

21:28.822 --> 21:31.792
I do get right up
to the edge though, don’t I?

21:35.696 --> 21:37.631
Why is that?

21:37.664 --> 21:40.300
I don’t know.
Maybe you like the view.

21:50.911 --> 21:52.546
Cousin...

21:52.579 --> 21:54.915
...what’s this?

21:54.948 --> 21:56.983
That’s
Lowell Kelly’s poem.

21:59.085 --> 22:00.687
"If you’ve made it
this far

22:00.721 --> 22:01.988
"you’re quite a mover.

22:02.022 --> 22:04.858
"Now buy a ticket,
and go to Vancouver.

22:11.064 --> 22:14.067
"Bring a rifle, a net,
put a smile on your face.

22:14.100 --> 22:17.838
"You’ll need all of these
for your wild‐goose‐chase."

22:23.143 --> 22:24.711
Beautiful.

22:27.013 --> 22:29.650
It was worth the effort.

22:39.993 --> 22:42.963
