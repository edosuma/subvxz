WEBVTT

00:01.067 --> 00:02.796
Myname is Michael Westen.

00:02.869 --> 00:05.531
I used to be a spy until--

00:05.605 --> 00:08.096
- [ Man ] We got a burn notice on you.
You're blacklisted.
- [ Whistles ]

00:08.173 --> 00:10.574
[ Michael Narrating]
Whenyou're burned,you've got nothing--

00:10.643 --> 00:13.203
no cash, no credit, nojob history.

00:13.279 --> 00:16.407
- You're stuck in whatever city
they decide to dump you in.
- Where am I?

00:16.483 --> 00:18.110
Miami.

00:18.184 --> 00:20.812
You do whatever work
comes your way.

00:20.887 --> 00:23.879
- You rely on anyone who's still talking to you--
- [ Laughs ]

00:23.957 --> 00:26.482
- a trigger-happy ex-girlfriend--
- Should we shoot them?

00:26.559 --> 00:29.392
an old friend who's informing
on you to the F..B.I.--

00:29.462 --> 00:31.760
You know spies.
Bunch of bitchy little girls.

00:31.831 --> 00:34.163
- F.amily too--
- Hey, is that your mom again?

00:34.234 --> 00:36.395
- ifyou're desperate.
- Someone needs your help, Michael.

00:36.469 --> 00:38.801
Bottom line: Untilyou figure out
who burnedyou...

00:40.974 --> 00:42.965
you're not going anywhere.

00:45.845 --> 00:49.303
[ Michael Narrating ] F.or most people,
a night out at the Miami clubs...

00:49.382 --> 00:51.350
is a chance to see and be seen.

00:51.418 --> 00:54.353
When you're under government surveillance,
it's a different story.

00:54.421 --> 00:58.357
You still want to know who's watchingyou,
but the reasons are a little different.

00:58.425 --> 01:01.326
- [ F.iona ] Looks like you've had visitors.
- T ook 'em long enough.

01:01.394 --> 01:05.524
[ Narrating ] Sprinkle a mixture offlour and
Day-Glo powder on your floor before you go out...

01:05.598 --> 01:09.159
andyou'll know whetheryou've had
any visitors and what they were after.

01:09.235 --> 01:13.069
- Three-man team?
- Sounds about right. Two sneakers and a loafer.

01:13.139 --> 01:15.198
They're not terribly careful,
your surveillance.

01:15.275 --> 01:17.766
[ Michael Narrating] You don't always
have to get that clever though.

01:17.844 --> 01:20.540
Sometimes theywantyou to know
what they're up to.

01:20.613 --> 01:25.107
- They weren't hiding.
- I miss your F.B.I. detail. They were kind of sweet.

01:25.185 --> 01:27.119
The feds were errand boys.

01:27.187 --> 01:29.849
But these guys, on the other hand,
might actually know something useful.

01:29.923 --> 01:34.053
I don't know why they bother. They should just
put a bullet in your head and be done with it.

01:34.127 --> 01:36.618
Apparently, I'm more valuable
alive than dead...

01:36.696 --> 01:38.823
but I'm sure they'll take it
under advisement.

01:38.898 --> 01:41.230
Oh, you think they're listening?

01:41.301 --> 01:44.464
[ Cell Phone Ringing]

01:46.306 --> 01:49.173
- Yeah, Mom.
- Michael, there are men here
outside the house with guns.

01:49.242 --> 01:51.233
What? What men?

01:51.311 --> 01:54.075
I don't know. They've been watching.
They're coming inside.

01:54.147 --> 01:56.445
Call the cops. Call them right now.

02:04.958 --> 02:07.449
- Take the van and cover the street.
- Not a problem.

02:11.498 --> 02:13.830
Hey.

02:13.900 --> 02:15.527
What?

02:23.943 --> 02:26.207
- Stop right there.
- It's okay. It's okay.

02:26.279 --> 02:27.347
[ Grunts ]

02:27.347 --> 02:28.336
[ Grunts ]

02:36.789 --> 02:39.383
Mom? Mom!

02:39.459 --> 02:44.055
F.ourteen minutes.
Oh, I figuredyou for 12.

02:44.130 --> 02:45.927
It's probably those causeways.

02:45.999 --> 02:50.095
See, you'll have to forgive my sketchy
Miami geography. I'm new in town.

02:50.170 --> 02:53.401
- We nearlygot lost coming from yourplace.
- Mom, are you okay?

02:53.473 --> 02:57.307
They cut the phone lines. I couldn't call
the police. Then they broke in, and I--

02:57.377 --> 03:00.778
It's okay. It's okay.
Want to tell me who you are?

03:00.847 --> 03:03.315
I'm the new man in your life.

03:03.383 --> 03:05.248
[ Chuckles ]

03:05.318 --> 03:07.650
- Michael!
- It's okay. It's okay.

03:07.720 --> 03:09.585
You pissed off a lot of people...

03:09.656 --> 03:12.887
gettingyourhands on the HomelandSecurity
directive authorizingyourburn notice.

03:12.959 --> 03:15.484
You're a private citizen now. You're not
supposed to touch that kind of thing.

03:15.562 --> 03:17.393
I asked nicely.

03:17.463 --> 03:20.796
You wanted attention from someone
a little higher up on the food chain.

03:20.867 --> 03:24.132
- That's about right.
- It's your lucky day. Here I am.

03:24.204 --> 03:27.503
- And here I will stay--
- [ Shatters ]

03:27.574 --> 03:29.940
untilyou back off.

03:30.009 --> 03:33.001
Michael, why are they doing this?
Are you in some kind oftrouble?

03:33.079 --> 03:36.446
Not now. Not now, Mom.
Your problem is with me, not with her.

03:36.516 --> 03:38.916
- You have no business coming here.
- Oh, no, but we do.

03:38.985 --> 03:42.443
See, you're a major security risk.
You just assaulted two federal agents.

03:42.522 --> 03:45.753
Go ahead. Arrest me.
I'd like to take a look at the indictment.

03:49.229 --> 03:50.856
- Wouldn'tyou now?
- Yeah.

03:52.198 --> 03:55.497
Listen, you be a good boy,
and I'll get out ofyour hair.

03:57.337 --> 03:59.669
Until then, I'll need to keep looking.

03:59.739 --> 04:02.003
God!

04:05.245 --> 04:07.270
Sorry. You can't be too careful.

04:07.347 --> 04:10.339
[Michael Narrating] There are
two kinds ofgovernment surveillance--

04:10.416 --> 04:12.179
the kind that's there
to look for something...

04:12.252 --> 04:15.619
and the kind that's just there
to make your life difficult.

04:21.761 --> 04:26.391
- ? Party, partypeople ?
- ? I'm in the front at the bar
with a drink in each hand ?

04:26.466 --> 04:28.730
- ? Livin'large with my ?
- ? Party, partypeople ?

04:28.801 --> 04:31.531
? I'm in the back ofthe club
with a cutie by my side ??

04:31.604 --> 04:35.005
Mi ke, you got problems like that, call me.
I still got pull in that department.

04:35.074 --> 04:39.306
- Maybe I can get him to go home.
- I don't want him to go home.
I need this guy in town.

04:39.379 --> 04:42.974
- I need to know who he is and what he knows.
- I can helpyou with that then.

04:43.049 --> 04:45.313
- I tried. I gotyourvoice mail.
- Yeah. Sorry about that.

04:45.385 --> 04:47.376
It's the new lady friend.

04:47.453 --> 04:50.581
She puts a lot of demands on my time,
ifyou know what I mean.

04:50.657 --> 04:53.649
- I don't, and I don't want to know.
- At least I'm offyour couch.

04:53.726 --> 04:56.718
So who doyou thinkwas atyour mom's?
They sound like charmers.

04:56.796 --> 04:59.321
You tell me.
What areyour F.B.I. friends telling you?

04:59.399 --> 05:02.994
Nothin'. Believe me, they'd be pissed ifthey
found out somebody pulled rank on 'em.

05:03.069 --> 05:07.096
These intelligence outfits, they're springing up
faster than frickin' Starbucks these days.

05:07.173 --> 05:10.199
[ Sighs ]
Let me know ifyou hear anything.

05:10.276 --> 05:12.107
Mmm. Whereyou goin'?

05:12.178 --> 05:14.169
I gotta scrounge up a job.

05:14.247 --> 05:17.410
My mom's house needs remodeling.
I might have to call Lucy.

05:17.483 --> 05:20.043
What about my SEAL buddy?
That thing I was telling you about.

05:20.119 --> 05:21.677
Is that a job or a favor?

05:21.754 --> 05:23.915
No, it's a job. It's real money.

05:23.990 --> 05:26.686
He's a great guy, Mike.
He saved my ass several times.

05:26.759 --> 05:29.125
He's a boat repo guy.

05:29.195 --> 05:31.686
- It's a toughjob. Hejust needs some muscle.
- Muscle. Great.

05:31.764 --> 05:33.561
- Hmm.
- There she is.

05:33.633 --> 05:36.625
- There you go, Sammy.
- Thankyou, doll. Plant one right there.

05:36.703 --> 05:38.933
- Mmm.
- Mm-hmm. [ Chuckling ]

05:39.005 --> 05:40.802
You sure I can't getyou anything?

05:40.873 --> 05:44.741
No, thankyou. I have out-of-town guests
I need to attend to.

05:44.811 --> 05:47.302
- You have fun.
- Mike, call me now.

05:54.253 --> 05:58.121
[Narrating] You can tie up a lot of
resources bykeeping a buggedphone line open.

05:58.191 --> 06:01.422
As long as it's open,
they're supposed to keep listening.

06:04.364 --> 06:07.856
- [ Beeping ]
- [ Line Ri ngs ]

06:07.934 --> 06:10.994
[ Man ] You have reached the consulate
of the commonwealth of Belize.

06:11.070 --> 06:14.062
- Leave your message after the tone.
- [ Beeps ]

06:14.140 --> 06:17.940
D-D-72478.

06:18.010 --> 06:20.604
[ Michael Narrating]
Saya few cryptic things now and then...

06:20.680 --> 06:24.138
and they'll be stuck in theirlittle van trying
to figure out what the hellyou're doing.

06:24.217 --> 06:28.119
5:00 p.m., March 1 5. Twenty percent.

06:28.187 --> 06:31.588
[ Michael Narrating ] They can't go home,
can't grab a bite to eat, can't take a leak.

06:31.657 --> 06:36.151
[ Woman On TV ] Only you will have it, and a
limited number ofviewers who are lucky enough--

06:36.229 --> 06:39.289
[ Michael Narrating]And the longerthey're
stuck in a van with a set ofheadphones...

06:39.365 --> 06:41.595
the moreyou can find out about them.

06:41.667 --> 06:44.261
[ Man On TV]Just look at that
round-cut brilliance. Look at all those--

06:51.210 --> 06:54.304
Appreciate you comin', Mike.
Sam's told me a good deal about you.

06:54.380 --> 06:57.372
- Really?
- Come on, Mike. Don't be like that.

06:57.450 --> 07:00.783
- Virg is one of us.
- SEAL teams-- Panama, Iraq, China.

07:00.853 --> 07:04.482
Last time I checked,
I had top-secret clearance...

07:04.557 --> 07:06.548
though I haven't checked in a while.

07:06.626 --> 07:09.117
Sam tells meyou're some kind ofspy.

07:11.597 --> 07:13.800
- Or used to be. Y'all want a beer?
- Yeah, I'll take one.

07:13.800 --> 07:14.630
- Or used to be. Y'all want a beer?
- Yeah, I'll take one.

07:14.700 --> 07:16.725
I knewyou'd want one, Sam.
What aboutyou, Mike?

07:16.803 --> 07:18.794
You might be hot in that jacket.

07:18.871 --> 07:21.237
No, I'm good. What's the job?

07:21.307 --> 07:23.468
Pain in my ass.

07:23.543 --> 07:26.535
I was supposed to repo a Donzi 27 ZR...

07:26.612 --> 07:29.706
for a guywho's done me a few favors.

07:29.782 --> 07:34.151
But I went to pick the thing up, and a couple
ofJamaicans tuned me up but good.

07:34.220 --> 07:36.154
Damn embarrassing.

07:36.222 --> 07:38.747
Come on. They had 30 years on you
and a baseball bat.

07:38.825 --> 07:42.989
I am on blood thinners.
Goddamn pills make me light-headed.

07:43.062 --> 07:46.259
Oh, hell. That's no excuse.
Anyway, now I'm in a bind.

07:46.332 --> 07:48.766
Word gets out I can't hack it--
[ Whistles ] I'm done.

07:48.835 --> 07:51.065
Not one to ask forhelp, but there it is.

07:52.171 --> 07:54.036
That's a fast boat. Smuggling?

07:54.106 --> 07:57.007
It's a high-performance speedboat
in a crappylittle hellhole ofa marina.

07:57.076 --> 07:59.010
What the hell else is it gonna be?

07:59.078 --> 08:02.411
Maybe Cuban cigars, maybe grass.

08:02.482 --> 08:06.213
Problem is, these guys have guns,
and they like to wave 'em around.

08:06.285 --> 08:09.118
Listen, just pick the thing up,
point "A" to point "B."

08:09.188 --> 08:12.055
Is that all? Point "A" to point "B."
Well, when you put it that way--

08:12.124 --> 08:16.220
[ Virgil]All right. Look. I'dgo down there
withyou guys, but these guys know me.

08:16.295 --> 08:19.093
Two grand each, cash on delivery.

08:20.266 --> 08:22.063
Mybuddy Mason...

08:22.134 --> 08:27.037
is gonna be waitin' for it
at a repair warehouse up on 23rd.

08:27.106 --> 08:29.734
Mike, we get Fi involved,
we got a three-man team.

08:29.809 --> 08:32.607
Do it just like that personnel carrier
in Bulgaria.

08:32.678 --> 08:35.510
I mean, look, I gotta get
my new lady friend somethin' nice...

08:35.881 --> 08:37.873
and you sure as hell need the cash.

08:37.950 --> 08:40.783
Free gator steaks in it foryou.
Best in the Everglades.

08:42.655 --> 08:44.646
I'll think about it.

08:44.724 --> 08:47.591
[Motor Whirring]

08:50.963 --> 08:53.761
- You're towing mycar.
- Hey. Yeah.

08:53.833 --> 08:55.767
- There might be evidence in here.
- Evidence?

08:55.835 --> 09:00.295
There's a busted 8-track and one of my mom's
lamps I'm trying to piece back together.

09:00.373 --> 09:02.364
Well, I guess we'll find out, won't we?

09:02.441 --> 09:06.275
Oh, we noticed suspicious activity on your
phone line, so we took care ofit foryou.

09:06.345 --> 09:09.508
- Oh, thanks.
- Alas, you won't have phone service for a while.

09:09.582 --> 09:12.574
Hey, you want a stick of gum?

09:12.652 --> 09:14.745
Yeah, thanks.
I didn't catch your name.

09:14.820 --> 09:16.913
No, you didn't.

09:22.728 --> 09:24.662
[ Beeping ]

09:26.232 --> 09:28.826
Yeah, Sam. About that job-- I'm in.

09:28.901 --> 09:32.564

I need to borrow his truck.

Ooh, he's cute.

10:10.209 --> 10:14.373
We're gonna take his boat. I doubt he's
gonna giveyou his phone number.

10:14.447 --> 10:16.642
Who knows? I've had stranger dates.

10:16.716 --> 10:19.150
So what's your cover I.D., Mikey?

10:19.218 --> 10:23.678
Think I 'm gonna go with
devoted employee.

10:23.756 --> 10:27.556
- How's, uh, Homer?
- Homer. I like it.

10:27.627 --> 10:30.391
[ Michael Narrating]
As a rule, spies don't like dealing with cops.

10:30.463 --> 10:32.897
Covert ops are illegal by definition.

10:32.965 --> 10:36.401
- Ifthey were legal,
they wouldn't need to be covert.
- [ Si ghs ]

10:36.469 --> 10:38.994
You want me to set up that one, Mike?
The sailboat?

10:39.071 --> 10:41.665
Yeah, that's good.

10:43.776 --> 10:45.767
[ Michael Narrating]
Still, the police can be useful...

10:45.845 --> 10:49.508
- ifyou need a little insurance
against people shooting.
- [ Beeping ]

10:49.582 --> 10:51.743
Yeah, hi. Um--

10:51.817 --> 10:56.345
Boy, I don't know if this is the sort of thing
I should be calling the police about, but--

10:56.422 --> 11:00.188
Oh, I-I'm at the, uh-- the marina
down on Waverly Street.

11:00.259 --> 11:03.717
Yeah, um, I saw some men loading
bags full ofwhite powder...

11:03.796 --> 11:05.730
into a sailboat.

11:05.798 --> 11:08.358
[ Chuckles ]
Kinda creeped me out, you know?

11:08.434 --> 11:11.699
[Siren Wailing]

11:21.480 --> 11:24.881
- Hey there.
- Can I helpyou?

11:24.950 --> 11:26.713
Yes, sir. I'm here for that boat.

11:26.786 --> 11:29.812
- Oh, you're with the repo man, huh?
- My boss. Hell of a guy.

11:29.889 --> 11:32.585
He's like a father to me.
You beat him up pretty good.

11:32.658 --> 11:34.626
Yeah, that was unfortunate.

11:34.694 --> 11:39.631
I tried to explain the situation to him,
but he forced me to clarify my position.

11:39.699 --> 11:41.564
This is my property.

11:41.634 --> 11:43.966
We've got the paperwork right here
that says otherwise.

11:44.036 --> 11:47.563
Hmm. Well, that paperwork
is misinformed.

11:47.640 --> 11:50.803
Mmm. Whydon't we ask the police
to sort this out?

37:58.199 --> 38:00.360
Boys, boys, boys! Calm down.

38:00.435 --> 38:02.232
We have a little bit of business first.

38:02.303 --> 38:05.898
Andre, let Virgil go.
Andre, let Virgil go!

38:05.974 --> 38:07.839
I'm gonna find you,
and I'm gonna kill you--

38:07.909 --> 38:11.743
I know, I know! And then you'll cut my throat.
I know, I know. Let him go.

38:11.813 --> 38:14.646
Andre, it's the fumes that ignite.
I don't even have to touch it.

38:14.716 --> 38:18.243
Wait, wait, wait! Okay, okay.

38:24.125 --> 38:26.719
Have-- Have you two guys met?

38:26.794 --> 38:28.921
You have a lot to talk about.

38:28.997 --> 38:32.091
Andre, Detective Mason.
Detective Mason, Andre.

38:32.167 --> 38:34.226
- Get down on the ground!
- You ain't a cop. You're a thief!.

38:34.302 --> 38:36.361
- Okay, on the ground!
- You ain't no cop.

38:36.437 --> 38:39.736
- On the ground! Now! Now!
- Call! Call for backup!

38:39.807 --> 38:41.707

Move out! Let's go, let's go!

38:58.760 --> 39:00.591
Don't let it burn!

39:04.098 --> 39:06.760
[ Men Shouting ]

39:15.009 --> 39:18.809
Come on, Mike. I mean, you'd think we'd
be able to keep a little more than this.

39:18.880 --> 39:21.246
- We took what we needed.
- My daughter called.

39:21.316 --> 39:24.251
She's pissed at me, as usual.

39:24.319 --> 39:26.947
But she's home.
They dropped the charges.

39:27.021 --> 39:29.956
Theyhad to, with theJamaicans dead
and the cops injail.

39:30.024 --> 39:33.221
But unfortunately, you're going to have
to get out of town for a while, Virgil.

39:33.294 --> 39:36.593
With this all over the papers, there are still
a few people out there...

39:36.664 --> 39:39.292
who want to put a bullet in you.

39:39.367 --> 39:43.463
- I'll get the boat fixed up
and go down to the Bahamas.
- Great.

39:43.538 --> 39:46.598
You're sureyou're not just trying to
keep me away from your sweet mama?

39:47.875 --> 39:49.672
Hey, Virg. Don't push it.

39:52.780 --> 39:55.772
Okay. I'll go make my good-byes.

39:55.850 --> 39:57.784
Gentlemen.

40:01.723 --> 40:04.283
- I thinkyou're even, Sam.
- Yeah.

40:04.359 --> 40:07.920
Phew. Oh, by the way,
I, uh, made some calls.

40:07.996 --> 40:10.294
Talked to a buddy of mine at the F.B.I.

40:10.365 --> 40:12.959
Looks like I got the Charger back.

40:13.034 --> 40:15.298
Let'sjust call it a thankyou gift.

40:15.370 --> 40:18.168
- You're welcome, Sam.
- [ Chuckles ]

40:18.239 --> 40:20.173
Okay. I need a beer.

40:27.915 --> 40:30.907
[ Michael Narrating] Getting information out
ofsomeone who doesn't want to give it up...

40:30.985 --> 40:35.615
is all about upsetting the target's
emotional balance, impairing theirjudgment.

40:35.690 --> 40:38.284
- F.ear's good for that. Anger's not bad either.
- Hey, buddy.

40:38.359 --> 40:40.987
I thought we could spend
some more time together.

40:41.062 --> 40:44.031
[ Sighs ] You really don't understand
the situation here, do you?

40:44.098 --> 40:46.225
You're out, man. That's it.

40:46.301 --> 40:49.202
- You should be in jail.
-Jail? That's interesting. Whyjail?

40:49.270 --> 40:53.001
- I don't remember ever doing anything jail-worthy.
- Hey, hey, hey.

40:53.074 --> 40:55.338
- Mmm. Mmm.
- Hey, don't get cute.

40:55.410 --> 40:58.573
I want to know why I got burned.
Show me the burn notice. Tell me. Why?

40:58.646 --> 41:00.876
You know damn well why.
I've seen the dossier.

41:00.948 --> 41:04.213
Dossier? I'd like to take a look
at that dossier. You have it on you?

41:04.285 --> 41:08.244
- Get off!. Getyour hands off me.
- Okay. All right. Fine.

41:08.323 --> 41:11.486
[Michael Narrating] Sometimes intelligence
gathering involves sophisticated techniques...

41:11.559 --> 41:14.323
and a lot ofhigh-tech equipment.

41:14.395 --> 41:17.489
But sometimes it's as simple
as picking someone's pocket.

41:17.565 --> 41:19.499
How'd we do?

41:22.437 --> 41:25.270
Good to meet you, Agent Bly.
