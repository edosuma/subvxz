00:37.705 --> 00:41.541
<i>The global economy continues
to collapse as food prices spike.</i>

00:41.543 --> 00:44.710
<i>The world population has now
reached its eighth-billion mark.</i>

00:44.712 --> 00:46.444
<i>Food has
now replaced oil</i>

00:46.446 --> 00:48.179
<i>in becoming the most
prized commodity.</i>

00:48.181 --> 00:51.551
<i>California has now broken its
all-time record for the longest heatwave.</i>

00:51.553 --> 00:55.220
We now have more than eight
billion mouths to feed.

00:55.222 --> 00:58.323
<i>Even the slightest drop
in our world food supply</i>

00:58.325 --> 01:01.594
<i>can mean the total collapse
of our way of life.</i>

01:01.596 --> 01:05.363
<i>Indonesia promises to be
the leading food basket of the world,</i>

01:05.365 --> 01:07.833
<i>as Indra Siswadi,
the youngest elected President</i>

01:07.835 --> 01:09.234
<i>in the history
of the country...</i>

01:09.236 --> 01:10.101
No more hunger!

01:10.103 --> 01:11.871
<i>...declared his mission
in aiding</i>

01:11.873 --> 01:14.408
<i>the new World Hunger
Prevention Initiative.</i>

01:29.356 --> 01:33.325
<i>In times like these,
we can't help but ask,</i>

01:33.327 --> 01:35.763
<i>is this the beginning
of the end?</i>

02:22.342 --> 02:23.343
Hungry?

02:32.754 --> 02:33.821
Starving.

02:35.790 --> 02:36.789
Wake up.

02:36.791 --> 02:39.491
You got that same squirm
the first time we met.

02:39.493 --> 02:41.927
I don't squirm.

02:41.929 --> 02:43.397
All right, maybe a little.

02:46.366 --> 02:48.400
It feels wrong letting you go
this time, I guess.

02:48.402 --> 02:50.468
Yo, Sari!

02:50.470 --> 02:53.572
We got the one-on-one
with Indra. Let's go!

02:53.574 --> 02:56.676
As in the
Presidential-elect, Indra?

02:56.678 --> 02:58.911
He's gonna change
the world, you know.

02:58.913 --> 03:00.280
Save a lot of people.

03:00.948 --> 03:02.349
You should come.

03:03.918 --> 03:05.951
As soon as I get
myself straight.

03:05.953 --> 03:06.954
Listen...

03:09.657 --> 03:10.892
I got something for you.

03:14.595 --> 03:16.494
There's no stone yet,

03:16.496 --> 03:18.465
so, I guess it won't be
official until...

03:19.399 --> 03:20.968
But I will. I mean...

03:23.037 --> 03:24.570
As... As soon as...

03:24.572 --> 03:25.873
Shut the fuck up.

03:42.056 --> 03:44.458
Can a proposed girl
get a minute here?

03:46.359 --> 03:47.862
I'll take that as a yes?

03:53.034 --> 03:55.968
You'll have to ask for my
parents' blessings first, dummy.

03:55.970 --> 03:58.271
They'd kill you
if they found out about this.

03:59.040 --> 04:00.373
Copy that.

04:06.346 --> 04:07.949
Ask me again
when I get back.

04:10.051 --> 04:12.385
And next time,
don't mumble.

04:23.931 --> 04:24.966
Yes, ma'am.

04:36.711 --> 04:37.712
<i>Wake up.</i>

04:44.417 --> 04:45.920
Morning, Mr. Congressman.

04:51.125 --> 04:52.627
Thank you for last night.

04:59.399 --> 05:00.535
<i>Good morning.</i>

05:01.401 --> 05:02.804
<i>It is 8:00 a.m.</i>

05:09.010 --> 05:12.778
<i>The future is now.</i>

05:12.780 --> 05:16.381
<i>Puninar.
Your trusted solutions partner</i>

05:16.383 --> 05:18.085
<i>and the logistics
of the future.</i>

05:21.923 --> 05:23.991
Play on.

05:46.013 --> 05:47.646
All right.

05:47.648 --> 05:49.617
What is it this time?

06:46.207 --> 06:48.207
<i>PIRANAS delinquents,</i>

06:48.209 --> 06:50.945
<i>please stay behind the fence
and remain calm.</i>

06:54.949 --> 06:56.584
Hey! Hey!

06:57.084 --> 06:58.386
Hey!

06:58.920 --> 07:00.085
Hey!

07:00.087 --> 07:02.121
<i>Attention.</i>

07:02.123 --> 07:04.659
<i>Please stay behind the fence
and remain calm.</i>

07:06.994 --> 07:08.162
Get back inside!

07:12.934 --> 07:15.536
Mama.

07:16.737 --> 07:19.206
Mama!

07:21.809 --> 07:25.112
<i>Please proceed to the
filtering facility in an orderly manner.</i>

07:47.735 --> 07:49.635
<i>All citizens
must stand in line</i>

07:49.637 --> 07:51.706
<i>to secure your
weekly ration quota.</i>

07:56.143 --> 07:57.511
You a Marine girl?

07:58.779 --> 08:00.713
Sergeant Raya, sir.

08:00.715 --> 08:03.716
How'd you figure that, sir?

08:03.718 --> 08:07.186
Well, let's just say you and I
both know how to respect the quiet,

08:07.188 --> 08:09.021
unlike the Air Force.

08:09.023 --> 08:10.490
Yes, sir.

08:35.049 --> 08:38.784
<i>This is
Level One PIRANAS Military.</i>

08:38.786 --> 08:43.257
<i>All personnel must uncover their faces
and heads for facial identification.</i>

09:24.632 --> 09:26.932
Ah, Mr. Secretary.

09:26.934 --> 09:30.069
- How's it hanging, sir?
- Shriveled.

09:30.071 --> 09:33.872
Licked by many,
deformed by all the bullshit.

09:33.874 --> 09:35.176
But I digress.

09:36.043 --> 09:37.578
I regret I asked.

09:38.212 --> 09:39.745
Listen.

09:39.747 --> 09:42.381
It is a gross
understatement to say...

09:42.383 --> 09:45.619
that it's difficult for me
to get this kind of meeting.

09:47.088 --> 09:48.189
Yes, sir.

09:49.156 --> 09:50.324
Thank you, sir.

09:50.825 --> 09:53.894
Do not embarrass me.

10:05.406 --> 10:06.740
Mr. President.

10:07.308 --> 10:09.208
Congressman Angga.

10:09.210 --> 10:10.811
The man I've been
telling you about.

10:11.679 --> 10:13.045
Mr. President.

10:13.047 --> 10:14.379
As you must already know,

10:14.381 --> 10:16.782
in the cowboy hat,
Mr. Hengky Laksono.

10:16.784 --> 10:19.384
Man in charge
of all things public media.

10:19.386 --> 10:22.089
More handsome in person
than on TV, I'm sure.

10:23.691 --> 10:25.390
General Adnan Atmadja,

10:25.392 --> 10:27.726
Commander of
the GERRAM Paramilitaries.

10:27.728 --> 10:30.062
And the head of
the PIRANAS Party himself,

10:30.064 --> 10:31.396
Mr. Farid Baskoro.

10:31.398 --> 10:33.899
It's a pleasure
to finally meet you, sir.

10:33.901 --> 10:37.638
I like to think of them as
the four pillars of PIRANAS.

10:38.739 --> 10:41.140
More like the four horsemen.

10:45.746 --> 10:48.113
Impressive job
on that Farmer's Bill.

10:48.115 --> 10:51.450
Looks like you wanna be
on the winner's team.

10:51.452 --> 10:53.018
Always, Mr. President.

10:53.020 --> 10:54.054
But...

10:54.688 --> 10:56.223
enough with the ass-kissing.

10:57.158 --> 10:58.292
Truth is, gentlemen...

10:59.894 --> 11:01.095
you suck at PR.

11:04.965 --> 11:07.001
- Angga.
- Let him speak.

11:10.337 --> 11:11.906
You see, our economy...

11:12.873 --> 11:14.108
well, it may be in the lead.

11:15.376 --> 11:17.278
But, the biggest threat...

11:18.445 --> 11:19.880
still lies within.

11:21.215 --> 11:23.117
Gentlemen, the people
are starving.

11:24.852 --> 11:26.987
Their nationalism, morale...

11:28.289 --> 11:29.390
dying.

11:30.991 --> 11:35.093
So, you're saying
we need to cut our profits

11:35.095 --> 11:36.929
and fight
world hunger bullshit?

11:36.931 --> 11:39.733
I'm saying, all they need...

11:40.535 --> 11:41.902
is a dream.

11:43.370 --> 11:45.839
Something that'll take
their minds off the hunger.

11:47.007 --> 11:49.210
A promise of a better future.

11:49.877 --> 11:51.278
A Heroic Act.

11:53.380 --> 11:55.214
You see, gentlemen,

11:55.216 --> 11:57.216
The Reform,

11:57.218 --> 11:59.785
they're secretly gaining
massive followers.

11:59.787 --> 12:01.388
Promising more food for all.

12:02.557 --> 12:04.124
And whether
you like it or not,

12:05.826 --> 12:09.363
the people will side with anyone
who can offer them change.

12:10.231 --> 12:12.130
And these guys,

12:12.132 --> 12:15.501
they're saying exactly
what they want to hear.

12:15.503 --> 12:18.906
You're looking at a ticking
time bomb strapped to your ass.

12:20.441 --> 12:22.007
What are you proposing?

12:22.009 --> 12:23.177
We destroy their idea.

12:24.512 --> 12:26.878
Regains the people's trust.

12:26.880 --> 12:28.914
PIRANAS gets a new face-lift.

12:28.916 --> 12:30.918
Then, we can enjoy
our riches in peace.

12:32.587 --> 12:34.054
I volunteer for the lead.

12:34.922 --> 12:36.357
Black Ops. Off the books.

12:37.424 --> 12:38.459
And in return...

12:40.027 --> 12:42.429
I want 1%
of what PIRANAS makes.

12:43.531 --> 12:44.865
Every year...

12:45.833 --> 12:47.001
for the rest of its days.

12:48.302 --> 12:49.569
Holy shit.

13:04.351 --> 13:06.885
I hate it when you do that.

13:06.887 --> 13:08.420
Tell me I got it.

13:08.422 --> 13:11.189
Don't know how
you pulled that shit off.

13:11.191 --> 13:13.327
But... you got it, kid.

13:23.605 --> 13:24.838
What's this?

13:25.406 --> 13:26.706
The catch.

13:26.708 --> 13:29.810
They want you to lead the
operation with The Wolf himself.

13:30.377 --> 13:31.877
Wisnu.

13:31.879 --> 13:33.013
What?

13:33.981 --> 13:35.080
Get me back in there.

13:35.082 --> 13:36.150
You walk in there...

13:37.284 --> 13:40.085
we'll lose
this opportunity forever.

13:40.087 --> 13:44.423
I dislike the guy as much as you
do, you know that.

13:44.425 --> 13:47.294
But they trust his ass
more than yours.

13:49.597 --> 13:51.265
Do not screw this up.

14:52.527 --> 14:54.326
Finally,

14:54.328 --> 14:56.096
the four old men...

14:57.464 --> 15:00.065
have come to their senses.

15:00.067 --> 15:03.034
The hunger has turned us
against each other.

15:03.036 --> 15:06.340
No. It only shows you
who you really are.

15:07.241 --> 15:09.209
Guess we'll be working
together again.

15:15.149 --> 15:17.351
People are savages,
don't you think?

15:18.586 --> 15:21.689
We like to believe
we're better than animals.

15:22.322 --> 15:25.658
But the truth is, we kill.

15:25.660 --> 15:28.228
We feed off each other
just the same.

15:29.062 --> 15:30.164
Just the same.

15:32.166 --> 15:33.300
In this jungle,

15:34.268 --> 15:35.603
either you eat...

15:37.371 --> 15:38.606
or be eaten.

15:41.041 --> 15:42.109
Take a look.

15:44.378 --> 15:45.647
Prototype suit.

15:46.514 --> 15:47.649
Shipped this morning.

15:48.550 --> 15:49.684
American.

15:55.523 --> 15:57.222
My God.

15:57.224 --> 15:59.191
An invisibility cloak?

15:59.193 --> 16:00.358
Yes.

16:00.360 --> 16:01.663
They call it "The Hide."

16:03.063 --> 16:06.231
Combine military-grade
LED Kevlar

16:06.233 --> 16:08.536
with nano cameras
within the seams.

16:11.338 --> 16:12.740
First, the UAVs,

16:13.608 --> 16:14.676
the Kodiaks,

16:15.577 --> 16:16.744
and now this.

16:19.279 --> 16:20.615
They're licking our asses clean.

16:22.817 --> 16:25.183
Speaking of tactics,

16:25.185 --> 16:28.188
your so-called Heroic Act is...

16:29.223 --> 16:31.559
no offense, idiotic.

16:33.126 --> 16:35.229
We are here
to preserve order,

16:35.797 --> 16:37.565
not practice democracy.

16:39.266 --> 16:41.034
Well, I'm not here
for your opinion.

16:42.537 --> 16:44.506
You're still the same mutt
I met years ago.

16:45.507 --> 16:46.608
And me?

16:48.442 --> 16:50.177
Still head of this operation.

16:51.613 --> 16:52.747
So, fall in.

16:56.450 --> 16:57.451
You know...

16:59.621 --> 17:02.089
I used to love
dressing up like Rambo.

17:04.191 --> 17:06.059
Thought I'd be
more respected.

17:07.529 --> 17:10.297
It taught me a very,
very valuable lesson.

17:12.466 --> 17:13.535
Oh, yeah?

17:14.468 --> 17:15.469
What's that?

17:16.738 --> 17:18.704
Fear!

17:18.706 --> 17:24.209
Unlike in the movies,
real people, primitives...

17:24.211 --> 17:29.082
have no respect for bravery,
or kindness, or heroes.

17:29.551 --> 17:31.084
Only fear.

17:31.786 --> 17:33.485
You wanna stop
your Reform?

17:33.487 --> 17:36.356
The only way
is to exterminate them.

17:39.192 --> 17:40.494
You've got company.

17:43.665 --> 17:45.731
All units, black quad drone!

17:45.733 --> 17:47.769
North side!
Don't let it get away!

17:57.745 --> 17:58.746
Go!

18:07.287 --> 18:08.688
Hey.

18:08.690 --> 18:09.757
Hey, you!

18:10.424 --> 18:11.458
Somebody...

18:19.199 --> 18:20.200
Shoot!

18:23.805 --> 18:24.806
Hey!

18:25.607 --> 18:26.608
Hey, stop!

18:27.742 --> 18:28.876
Hey, you. Stop!

18:36.216 --> 18:37.217
Bitch!

18:40.220 --> 18:41.353
Right there!

18:41.355 --> 18:42.523
Stop right there!

18:44.257 --> 18:45.893
Hands. I wanna see them now!

18:50.263 --> 18:51.365
Who do you work for?

18:52.934 --> 18:55.168
Turn around, slowly!

19:00.742 --> 19:02.677
The smart pad,
toss it over!

19:10.918 --> 19:12.618
Hey, do you hear me?

19:21.495 --> 19:23.798
I'm a government official,
on duty.

19:24.799 --> 19:26.433
People will be
looking for me.

20:13.848 --> 20:14.949
Stay back!

20:15.750 --> 20:17.785
Weapons down, now!

20:23.290 --> 20:24.424
Stop!

20:36.938 --> 20:37.972
Sari?

20:39.006 --> 20:40.440
Lower your guns.

20:40.908 --> 20:42.275
I know this man.

20:44.478 --> 20:45.713
He's not one of 'em.

20:55.590 --> 20:57.890
I... I thought
you were dead.

20:57.892 --> 20:59.560
What does Wisnu
know about us?

21:01.796 --> 21:02.962
You joined the Reform?

21:02.964 --> 21:04.395
If you can't get me
what I need,

21:04.397 --> 21:05.800
- then you should leave.
- Sari, wait!

21:09.737 --> 21:11.469
Come with me.

21:11.471 --> 21:13.273
I've got everything
we've ever wanted.

21:15.543 --> 21:16.609
I can protect you...

21:16.611 --> 21:18.511
You helped incite
the Revolution.

21:18.513 --> 21:19.947
You really think
I didn't know that?

21:21.849 --> 21:24.617
I covered corruption stories
for breakfast, for God's sake.

21:24.619 --> 21:26.719
I did it for us!

21:26.721 --> 21:28.988
Don't you see
what this world has become?

21:28.990 --> 21:30.756
Hey, do you hear me?

21:30.758 --> 21:31.793
Mom.

21:36.463 --> 21:37.665
Pack your things, honey.

21:39.133 --> 21:40.802
We're leaving.

21:43.638 --> 21:44.739
I get it.

21:46.406 --> 21:48.341
And you're blaming me!

21:50.711 --> 21:51.846
She's yours.

21:55.448 --> 21:56.449
What?

22:00.955 --> 22:02.723
Since I found out
you were involved,

22:03.958 --> 22:05.392
Indra was being hunted...

22:06.961 --> 22:08.493
We went underground,

22:08.495 --> 22:10.497
spent years building
this Reform together.

22:13.868 --> 22:16.135
You founded the Reform?

22:16.137 --> 22:17.972
You've been fed
on lies, Angga.

22:23.544 --> 22:25.680
Then I just gave you
the death sentence.

22:31.886 --> 22:33.020
Get out!

22:34.589 --> 22:35.590
Now!

24:47.121 --> 24:49.088
Who's in charge?

24:49.090 --> 24:51.225
Where's the great
Reform's hideout?

24:59.333 --> 25:00.968
Guns! Guns!

25:40.341 --> 25:41.675
Clear!

25:45.946 --> 25:47.813
Alert the Party.

25:47.815 --> 25:50.584
The Congressman is now
an enemy of the state.

26:27.388 --> 26:30.758
Of all places,
abandoned shopping mall?

26:33.994 --> 26:35.096
We call it home.

26:37.665 --> 26:38.866
He's with us!

27:31.152 --> 27:32.820
Sari, Dinda, you all right?

27:35.756 --> 27:36.891
Spec.

27:38.192 --> 27:39.326
Where's everyone?

27:41.262 --> 27:42.263
We're it.

27:51.839 --> 27:52.905
Who's he?

27:52.907 --> 27:54.175
He helped us escape.

27:57.745 --> 27:58.913
He's clean.

28:01.148 --> 28:04.785
If I was a spy, this place
would've been burned to the ground.

28:15.362 --> 28:16.830
Sorry you had to be here.

28:19.266 --> 28:20.968
What are you
trying to achieve?

28:22.169 --> 28:24.171
You want your
presidency back, is that it?

28:27.007 --> 28:28.108
I used to.

28:29.977 --> 28:32.112
I fought so hard for what
this country would be...

28:33.013 --> 28:34.114
could be.

28:35.783 --> 28:36.951
Then, it all just...

28:38.385 --> 28:39.453
faded.

28:40.988 --> 28:43.088
The people,
they need to know

28:43.090 --> 28:45.025
what they're really
suffering for, Congressman.

28:45.527 --> 28:46.760
Greed.

28:47.294 --> 28:48.429
Corruption.

28:49.964 --> 28:52.264
That's why we're here.
Nothing more.

28:52.266 --> 28:53.767
Then what are you
waiting for?

28:54.802 --> 28:56.136
You've got your army with you.

28:56.837 --> 28:58.372
They seem equipped and ready.

28:59.507 --> 29:00.741
Walk with me.

29:05.412 --> 29:07.114
They were my voters.

29:07.982 --> 29:09.116
Believed in me.

29:10.818 --> 29:13.120
But now they're... here.

29:14.154 --> 29:15.256
But these people,

29:16.323 --> 29:17.958
and the one
that died today...

29:19.193 --> 29:20.294
volunteered.

29:21.295 --> 29:22.429
For me.

29:24.431 --> 29:25.897
You call them army.

29:25.899 --> 29:27.201
I call them family.

29:33.107 --> 29:35.407
If it wasn't for Spec,

29:35.409 --> 29:37.945
we would've never learned
to defend ourselves.

29:39.547 --> 29:40.914
Who is this Spec?

29:43.250 --> 29:44.885
Never knew his real name.

29:47.388 --> 29:49.056
Sari found him
on the streets.

29:50.157 --> 29:51.591
Saved him...

29:51.593 --> 29:53.325
just like she saved me.

29:53.327 --> 29:55.396
Then give me
that one phone call.

29:57.632 --> 30:00.434
I'll guarantee her safety
for the rest of her life.

30:08.008 --> 30:10.344
You have one minute
before they track us down.

30:20.220 --> 30:22.287
- Soeganda.
- Ganda, it's me. Listen.

30:22.289 --> 30:23.589
I don't have much time.

30:23.591 --> 30:26.158
Angga, what the hell happened?

30:26.160 --> 30:27.359
<i>They're accusing you
of helping</i>

30:27.361 --> 30:28.962
<i>the separatists,
for God's sake.</i>

30:29.897 --> 30:31.031
I've found her, Ganda.

30:31.999 --> 30:33.231
I've found Sari.

30:33.233 --> 30:34.132
<i>Kid, it's too late.</i>

30:34.134 --> 30:37.035
Your name is on
the GERRAM kill list.

30:37.037 --> 30:40.540
<i>Wisnu has taken your plan and
skewed it into one of his own.</i>

30:40.542 --> 30:44.409
And whatever it is,
it'll be carried out in three days.

30:44.411 --> 30:45.547
In three days?

30:46.246 --> 30:49.314
That's impossible.

30:49.316 --> 30:53.485
<i>Ganda, you've gotta help me stop
him, or I'll be dead.</i>

30:53.487 --> 30:56.254
Do you hear me?
Sari will be dead.

30:56.256 --> 30:57.257
Son...

30:59.493 --> 31:01.561
I love you like my own,

31:01.563 --> 31:03.897
but you cannot
win everything.

31:04.733 --> 31:06.967
<i>I'm sorry.
Good luck out there.</i>

31:16.678 --> 31:17.978
I wanna meet him.

31:21.348 --> 31:22.416
That takedown...

31:25.052 --> 31:26.220
straight-out military.

31:31.425 --> 31:33.528
Look, I'm putting together
an attack team.

31:37.431 --> 31:38.566
I want you in.

31:43.638 --> 31:44.905
I'm in.

31:53.581 --> 31:55.313
Let me
get this straight.

31:55.315 --> 31:57.685
- You want the five of us...
- Six.

31:59.153 --> 32:01.754
Pardon me, six.

32:01.756 --> 32:06.559
...to go after the adorable
Wisnu and his huggable thugs,

32:06.561 --> 32:09.930
to stop an unknown
PIRANAS conspiracy?

32:11.633 --> 32:13.666
Let's see, they have
a name for that.

32:13.668 --> 32:16.470
What is it? Oh, yeah,
it's treason!

32:20.240 --> 32:22.142
Are you fucking nuts?

32:23.410 --> 32:26.178
We'd... be dead.

32:26.180 --> 32:28.215
D-E-D. Dead!

32:31.018 --> 32:33.553
Besides, look at us.

32:33.555 --> 32:36.256
We've probably forgotten
half the things we used to do.

32:38.325 --> 32:41.028
And who the fuck
is this National Geographic?

32:44.566 --> 32:46.431
Innocent people's lives

32:46.433 --> 32:48.333
- are at stake here.
- Oh, bullshit, LT.

32:48.335 --> 32:51.071
Since when do you care, huh?

32:52.072 --> 32:54.339
Hey, maybe Wisnu is right.

32:54.341 --> 32:55.641
Maybe they are terrorists.

32:55.643 --> 32:57.175
Maybe they all
deserve to die.

32:57.177 --> 32:58.613
I found her, Ogs!

33:00.214 --> 33:01.215
Sari.

33:03.150 --> 33:05.553
And a little girl
that turns out to be mine.

33:10.224 --> 33:13.528
All of us,
we're at the top of the kill list.

33:19.701 --> 33:21.603
Is everything okay in here?

33:22.837 --> 33:24.604
I hope you don't mind

33:24.606 --> 33:27.341
- the powder tea.
- Ma! Will you just get out?

33:30.344 --> 33:31.779
Just trying to help.

33:35.850 --> 33:37.084
Look...

33:37.719 --> 33:39.119
I feel you.

33:41.255 --> 33:45.459
And PIRANAS, man, I'd shove it up
their bumhole any day of the week.

33:46.694 --> 33:48.061
But I can't.

33:48.830 --> 33:50.130
I...

33:51.164 --> 33:52.567
I just can't.

33:57.572 --> 33:59.273
Then we'll show
ourselves out.

34:01.441 --> 34:02.810
It was nice
seeing you again, Ogs.

34:26.266 --> 34:28.068
You must be
so disappointed in me.

34:31.806 --> 34:33.673
Son,

34:33.675 --> 34:35.810
you've always chosen
your own path.

34:37.177 --> 34:38.680
And you've always
pulled through.

34:40.247 --> 34:41.481
Disappointed?

34:44.519 --> 34:47.220
You're just waiting for an
opportunity to impress...

34:49.222 --> 34:53.427
not just me,
but the whole world.

35:01.536 --> 35:02.637
LT!

35:05.907 --> 35:07.441
Could use the exercise.

35:08.743 --> 35:09.809
Come on!

35:09.811 --> 35:11.512
I'll show you
where the guys are.

35:29.897 --> 35:31.231
Which one is he?

35:32.066 --> 35:33.768
The one with his face
on the floor.

36:38.298 --> 36:41.334
Look, it's good
to see you guys and all,

36:42.269 --> 36:43.403
but...

36:44.404 --> 36:46.406
really not into reunions.

36:47.542 --> 36:49.443
Isn't that oil
all over you?

36:52.914 --> 36:54.247
So?

36:55.482 --> 36:56.716
No reason.

36:56.718 --> 36:58.285
Listen, Bara...

37:02.690 --> 37:05.457
- We got a job for you.
- Yeah.

37:05.459 --> 37:08.495
It's one of those
won't-make-it-out-alive kind.

37:10.932 --> 37:12.934
So it's a suicide mission?

37:17.538 --> 37:18.639
When do we start?

37:23.410 --> 37:24.645
What's in it for me?

37:27.048 --> 37:29.481
I told you the amount.

37:29.483 --> 37:30.850
You'd be worry-free
for the next decade.

37:30.852 --> 37:34.419
Oh, stop. We all know
how it is.

37:34.421 --> 37:36.321
Last cash lasted us,
what, huh,

37:36.323 --> 37:38.090
four, five years tops?

37:38.092 --> 37:39.892
Why do you think
they demoted me?

37:39.894 --> 37:42.528
Bullshit graveyard-shift,
checking every damn door

37:42.530 --> 37:44.697
in the PIRANAS Tower
before they finally fired me?

37:44.699 --> 37:46.364
Oh, come on, Tino.

37:46.366 --> 37:49.635
Where was our beloved LT
when the Corp kicked us out?

37:49.637 --> 37:52.772
He got that shiny brand-new
job passing dirty bills.

37:52.774 --> 37:55.574
With taxpayers' money.
Our money.

37:55.576 --> 37:57.375
All right, leave us.

37:57.377 --> 37:58.445
But...

38:11.793 --> 38:12.994
What do you want, Tino?

38:13.795 --> 38:14.862
Finally.

38:16.429 --> 38:17.865
You might've fooled the herd,

38:19.466 --> 38:20.601
not me.

38:23.938 --> 38:25.706
I want what you have.

38:38.553 --> 38:40.786
You think a fancy watch
will change my mind?

38:40.788 --> 38:42.788
Plus a quarter...

38:42.790 --> 38:45.660
of everything in my stash.

38:46.694 --> 38:47.795
Now, are you in...

38:48.863 --> 38:50.031
or out?

38:58.139 --> 38:59.439
Yeah.

39:00.641 --> 39:01.807
LT!

39:01.809 --> 39:04.043
Actually, I was
in the middle of my vlog.

39:04.045 --> 39:06.446
Um, so if you don't mind...

39:14.856 --> 39:16.557
- I gotta get outta here.
- Just...

39:18.826 --> 39:21.426
- Yo, freckle dick.
- Yo.

39:23.831 --> 39:25.099
- You son of a...
- Hey!

39:26.634 --> 39:28.634
Guys, guys, guys, stop!

39:28.636 --> 39:30.071
Hey, hey. Hey!

39:35.142 --> 39:37.111
Ethan, I need the best tech.

39:38.012 --> 39:39.144
I need you to find some

39:39.146 --> 39:42.850
very classified information
on the PIRANAS VIP server.

39:44.085 --> 39:46.785
The PIRANAS server?

39:46.787 --> 39:48.453
You gotta be shitting me.

39:48.455 --> 39:50.222
Look.

39:50.224 --> 39:52.560
We're not supposed
to tell you this, kid, but...

39:53.194 --> 39:56.631
It's a top-secret...

39:57.497 --> 39:59.033
recruitment test.

40:00.935 --> 40:02.234
What?

40:02.236 --> 40:04.171
Only a lucky few
get selected.

40:05.072 --> 40:07.172
You pass this one,

40:07.174 --> 40:08.974
all eyes will be on you, kid.

40:08.976 --> 40:10.709
You'd be famous.

40:10.711 --> 40:12.680
Wait, wait, wait.
Wait, wait.

40:14.148 --> 40:15.214
Uh...

40:15.216 --> 40:16.550
Acting gigs,

40:17.184 --> 40:18.552
red carpet famous?

40:19.220 --> 40:20.621
Sky's the limit.

40:22.690 --> 40:24.123
All right.

40:24.125 --> 40:25.458
Here goes nothing.

40:47.915 --> 40:49.515
Move! Move!

40:49.517 --> 40:51.786
Stand back! Get out!
Get out of my face.

40:52.920 --> 40:54.119
- Get back!
- Heads up.

40:54.121 --> 40:55.423
We've got company.

40:56.057 --> 40:57.222
They tracked us.

40:57.224 --> 40:58.524
Shit!

40:58.526 --> 40:59.758
- We've gotta get outta here.
- Wait.

40:59.760 --> 41:01.927
- Who's "they"?
- How much more time?

41:01.929 --> 41:03.764
- This isn't a test, is it?
- How much?

41:12.073 --> 41:13.174
Come on, come on,
come on!

41:15.977 --> 41:17.111
Move! Move!

41:21.682 --> 41:23.751
Done. I'm done. Holy shit!

41:31.158 --> 41:32.992
This can't be right, can it?

41:32.994 --> 41:34.795
Tomorrow's date.
Click on that.

41:37.631 --> 41:38.998
What is this?

41:39.000 --> 41:41.266
Nothing but PIRANAS
Senators' profiles.

41:41.268 --> 41:42.269
No.

41:42.737 --> 41:44.737
These are targets.

41:44.739 --> 41:48.207
Sacrificing their own Senators,
scapegoating the Reform.

41:48.209 --> 41:50.209
Wolves in sheep's clothing.

41:50.211 --> 41:52.311
It's a false-flag attack.

41:52.313 --> 41:54.947
There'll be murders
and riots.

41:54.949 --> 41:57.051
Give something for the people
to be angry about.

41:59.653 --> 42:01.789
A government-sanctioned
genocide.

42:16.837 --> 42:18.370
- Left, clear.
- Right, clear!

42:18.372 --> 42:19.707
All clear!

42:33.621 --> 42:34.922
Get the cavalry.

43:44.792 --> 43:46.060
Electrical manual?

43:48.195 --> 43:50.731
Hey, do you know when
your mother and I first met?

43:53.000 --> 43:55.269
We were instantly drawn
to each other.

43:57.171 --> 43:59.240
You know, like electricity.

44:00.374 --> 44:01.775
She used to say,

44:03.010 --> 44:04.443
"If you come any nearer,

44:04.445 --> 44:07.047
"I'll tase you in the face."

44:11.418 --> 44:13.819
Anyway...

44:13.821 --> 44:15.890
Thought I'd make up
for the lost time.

44:23.764 --> 44:26.298
I found it
in the old bookstore.

44:26.300 --> 44:28.836
A free fox pin included
in the back page, too.

44:30.304 --> 44:32.239
Look, I know
I wasn't there for you...

44:38.412 --> 44:39.713
Wake up.

44:44.451 --> 44:45.986
A children's fable?

44:47.121 --> 44:48.822
She's 12, not five.

44:50.491 --> 44:51.992
She's stubborn.

44:54.795 --> 44:56.363
Wonder where she got it from.

44:59.867 --> 45:00.935
You know...

45:03.971 --> 45:06.907
I never really had the chance
to say thank you, for...

45:07.775 --> 45:09.176
what you and the boys did.

45:11.245 --> 45:12.413
So, thank you.

45:20.955 --> 45:23.824
Is it a good time
to meet your parents now?

45:25.960 --> 45:29.061
Oh, you'll never get a chance
to see them now, slick.

45:29.063 --> 45:31.265
You're the bastard
who knocked me up and left me.

45:34.201 --> 45:35.336
Never again.

45:37.071 --> 45:38.270
What?

45:38.272 --> 45:39.406
Don't mumble.

45:41.075 --> 45:42.743
I'll never leave you again.

45:49.850 --> 45:51.018
Maybe it's too late.

45:53.053 --> 45:54.922
I heard about
the attack plan tomorrow.

45:57.057 --> 45:58.759
There's no turning back
from that.

46:05.099 --> 46:06.133
Hey, guys.

46:06.767 --> 46:08.202
Let's get up on the double.

46:09.036 --> 46:10.104
Moving out.

46:13.575 --> 46:16.944
Tino, you're one of
the smartest people I know.

46:17.978 --> 46:20.281
You're gonna start telling me
it's impossible?

46:26.153 --> 46:27.788
Fucking hell.

46:30.190 --> 46:31.191
We'll think simple.

46:33.561 --> 46:35.062
Subtract.

47:14.602 --> 47:15.936
What is this?

47:23.143 --> 47:24.445
For the Reform!

47:47.167 --> 47:48.367
- Ganda!
- Angga!

47:50.003 --> 47:51.238
No time to explain.
Let's go!

47:53.273 --> 47:55.440
Move, move!
Move, move!

47:55.442 --> 47:56.578
Go, go, go!

47:58.513 --> 48:00.479
Go, go, go. Go, go!
Move, move, move.

48:00.481 --> 48:01.549
Get in the car!

48:03.951 --> 48:05.984
Stick to the plan.
I'll tell you where to go.

48:05.986 --> 48:07.054
Copy that.

48:08.188 --> 48:09.591
- Smoke 'em out!
- Smoke 'em out!

48:13.561 --> 48:15.093
Let's go!

48:15.095 --> 48:17.597
Package is secured!
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

48:17.599 --> 48:19.131
I'm on it. You go.

48:19.133 --> 48:20.167
Spec, no!

48:33.581 --> 48:35.683
Holy shit!
We've got Kodiaks.

48:40.120 --> 48:41.219
We gotta get out of here!

48:41.221 --> 48:43.190
Go, go, go!
Get in!

48:44.291 --> 48:45.426
Let's go! Let's go!

49:23.698 --> 49:25.765
No. Sari!

49:25.767 --> 49:27.132
No!

49:45.252 --> 49:47.120
Wasn't easy or cheap!

49:48.556 --> 49:50.692
But whatever you manage
to destroy...

49:54.094 --> 49:55.160
we fix.

49:55.162 --> 49:57.730
Oh, my God.

49:57.732 --> 50:00.668
Spent a lifetime searching
for this filthy rabbit hole.

50:02.269 --> 50:03.671
But now that I'm here...

50:06.473 --> 50:08.340
it feels like home.

50:08.342 --> 50:09.441
What did you do to her?

50:09.443 --> 50:12.110
No, put that away.

50:12.112 --> 50:14.782
She's just pretty beat up from
putting up a mean fight, is all.

50:15.683 --> 50:17.184
Killed three of my men.

50:20.287 --> 50:24.222
Why don't you tell your men
to drop their antique toys...

50:24.224 --> 50:26.360
before I put a hole in her face.

50:35.837 --> 50:37.137
Roll, please!

50:54.822 --> 50:57.355
Long live the Reform.

51:11.806 --> 51:13.173
No!

51:21.281 --> 51:22.915
And that's it!

51:22.917 --> 51:24.117
Quick,

51:24.619 --> 51:27.154
simple, graphic.

51:27.789 --> 51:29.389
Just how the people want it.

51:35.329 --> 51:37.295
You fuck!

51:37.297 --> 51:39.834
Well, I got a surprise
for you.

51:48.442 --> 51:50.509
Congressman!
Congressman, here!

51:50.511 --> 51:52.243
Dinda!

51:52.245 --> 51:53.613
Dinda, you all right?

51:53.615 --> 51:55.748
Mama!

51:55.750 --> 51:58.651
Dinda! Mommy's okay, baby.
Mama's all right.

51:58.653 --> 52:00.287
Look, you win, all right?

52:01.488 --> 52:03.488
The Reform is finished!

52:03.490 --> 52:05.691
What else do you
want from me?

52:05.693 --> 52:07.827
You like making deals, right?

52:07.829 --> 52:09.196
So here's one for you.

52:19.373 --> 52:20.608
You see this remote?

52:21.042 --> 52:22.775
Say, "I see it."

52:22.777 --> 52:24.510
- I see it!
- Good.

52:24.512 --> 52:27.682
It triggers the bomb I planted
on the elevator's cable.

52:29.984 --> 52:31.284
Set it to...

52:32.386 --> 52:33.588
one minute.

52:36.490 --> 52:40.559
So you gotta choose
how you spend that minute.

52:40.561 --> 52:43.529
Save your woman,
or your kid.

52:43.531 --> 52:44.830
But if I were you,

52:44.832 --> 52:47.300
I'd use it to haul
my own ass out of here.

52:53.775 --> 52:57.510
You've shown what you would
do for the ones you love.

52:57.512 --> 52:59.246
Now show them
who you really are.

53:05.285 --> 53:06.353
Hey, you.

53:08.656 --> 53:10.457
You will die in pieces.

53:15.262 --> 53:16.263
Let him be.

53:16.864 --> 53:18.331
And kill the others.

53:22.970 --> 53:24.402
Move!

54:56.564 --> 54:57.630
Hold on, honey!

55:03.805 --> 55:05.104
Hey, Dinda.

55:05.106 --> 55:06.906
What are you doing?

55:20.721 --> 55:22.623
What are you doing?
She's in there!

55:23.558 --> 55:25.124
Get off me!

55:25.126 --> 55:27.394
Stop! Stop...
Will you stop it?

55:38.906 --> 55:40.440
No!

55:55.823 --> 55:58.724
You killed my daughter,
you monster!

55:58.726 --> 56:00.094
Get off of me!

56:07.902 --> 56:09.036
Hold on!

56:18.445 --> 56:20.880
- The emergency brakes.
- Mama!

56:20.882 --> 56:22.516
- We're okay!
- Do you hear that?

56:23.618 --> 56:24.917
Dinda's fine.

56:24.919 --> 56:27.119
I'm gonna get you up.

56:27.121 --> 56:29.757
Don't you give up...
Ah, shit!

56:40.467 --> 56:42.469
Angga! Listen to me!

56:43.537 --> 56:44.839
You take care of her.

56:46.207 --> 56:47.474
Tell her...

56:48.776 --> 56:50.811
be brave for the new world
to come.

56:51.545 --> 56:52.780
Sari, please.

56:54.015 --> 56:55.816
I can't lose you again.

56:59.887 --> 57:00.888
Wake up.

57:01.756 --> 57:02.790
You never did.

57:44.665 --> 57:45.666
Papa!

57:46.233 --> 57:47.299
I'm here!

57:47.301 --> 57:48.970
Listen to my voice, Papa!

58:03.217 --> 58:04.518
Papa!

58:05.720 --> 58:07.188
Over here!

58:08.589 --> 58:10.191
Just follow my voice!

58:12.994 --> 58:14.095
Papa!

58:15.563 --> 58:18.764
Dinda, honey. I can't.

58:18.766 --> 58:20.101
I don't know what to do.

58:21.235 --> 58:23.769
Listen. We're gonna be okay.

58:23.771 --> 58:25.639
Get to the emergency
staircase!

58:26.374 --> 58:28.109
We need you
to pull us out.

58:29.110 --> 58:31.512
Come on! Focus!

58:34.315 --> 58:35.948
Hold on.

58:48.996 --> 58:50.362
Papa!

58:50.364 --> 58:52.066
- Dinda!
- We're back here!

59:00.174 --> 59:01.242
Angga!

59:09.750 --> 59:10.851
I'll get us help!

59:41.949 --> 59:43.117
What are you
waiting for?

59:58.866 --> 59:59.867
Pull!

1:00:01.068 --> 1:00:02.069
Hold on!

1:00:21.956 --> 1:00:23.057
Sergeant.

1:00:25.292 --> 1:00:26.792
They know everything.

1:00:26.794 --> 1:00:28.796
Never a big fan
of PIRANAS anyway, sir.

1:00:29.396 --> 1:00:30.731
We're here to help.

1:00:32.333 --> 1:00:33.634
Who told you?

1:00:48.249 --> 1:00:50.716
<i>It has been
eight excruciating hours</i>

1:00:50.718 --> 1:00:53.886
<i>since the capital kidnapping
incident this morning.</i>

1:00:53.888 --> 1:00:56.788
<i>Seven senators have
been held hostage so far,</i>

1:00:56.790 --> 1:00:59.360
<i>with no signs of demand
by the Reform separatists.</i>

1:01:01.195 --> 1:01:04.229
<i>That is, until recently,
when an anonymous video</i>

1:01:04.231 --> 1:01:06.200
<i>was made public
for the world to see.</i>

1:01:07.902 --> 1:01:09.268
<i>Warning.</i>

1:01:09.270 --> 1:01:13.240
<i>What you are about to see is
graphic and may disturb you.</i>

1:01:25.419 --> 1:01:27.319
Who are we
kidding, huh?

1:01:27.321 --> 1:01:30.291
How could six has-beens stop
the government in three days?

1:01:31.825 --> 1:01:33.227
We were fucked
from the start.

1:01:36.764 --> 1:01:37.765
What are you doing?

1:01:41.402 --> 1:01:43.001
Leaving.

1:01:43.003 --> 1:01:45.204
Job's done, remember?

1:01:45.206 --> 1:01:48.307
Our mugs are registered on the
top of the wanted list, Tino.

1:01:48.309 --> 1:01:49.908
No shit.

1:01:49.910 --> 1:01:51.478
If we stay here,
we're dead.

1:01:55.282 --> 1:01:56.717
Where do you think
you're going?

1:01:57.519 --> 1:01:59.284
The PIRANAS Tower.

1:01:59.286 --> 1:02:00.287
Why?

1:02:00.988 --> 1:02:01.989
How?

1:02:03.424 --> 1:02:05.224
- Never mind.
- Tino.

1:02:05.226 --> 1:02:07.326
No, no, no,
it's fucking brilliant.

1:02:07.328 --> 1:02:10.896
Even if we do manage
to get inside the gates...

1:02:10.898 --> 1:02:13.465
The Tower's
like a maze.

1:02:13.467 --> 1:02:16.368
We can't make it to the second
floor, let alone the VIP chamber.

1:02:16.370 --> 1:02:18.170
Yeah, but you can.

1:02:18.172 --> 1:02:21.006
You said it yourself,
you used to work graveyard there.

1:02:21.008 --> 1:02:23.976
You know its every
floor plan, inside and out.

1:02:23.978 --> 1:02:27.446
Maybe you've forgotten,
but they just butchered us out there!

1:02:27.448 --> 1:02:29.881
Including his
precious girlfriend!

1:02:29.883 --> 1:02:32.317
I'm going back.
I'm going back.

1:02:32.319 --> 1:02:34.321
I am going back!

1:02:43.097 --> 1:02:44.198
I'm going back.

1:02:54.275 --> 1:02:56.108
Un-fucking-believable.

1:02:56.110 --> 1:02:58.310
You two deserve
each other!

1:02:58.312 --> 1:03:00.245
Sir, couldn't help
but hearing.

1:03:00.247 --> 1:03:02.114
The presidential address
is only hours away.

1:03:02.116 --> 1:03:03.315
Even if you were
able to stop them,

1:03:03.317 --> 1:03:05.286
you won't make it
there in time. Sir.

1:03:12.459 --> 1:03:14.061
Not by driving,
anyway, sir.

1:03:14.763 --> 1:03:16.529
I'll tell them
you hijacked it.

1:03:16.531 --> 1:03:18.531
Thank you, Sergeant.

1:03:18.533 --> 1:03:20.566
I'm afraid we can't
join your fight, sir.

1:03:20.568 --> 1:03:22.903
- We're still under constant...
- I'm not asking you to.

1:03:25.272 --> 1:03:27.207
Help as many people out there
as you can, Sergeant.

1:03:29.410 --> 1:03:31.076
Oh, and sir...

1:03:31.078 --> 1:03:32.547
I think this
belongs to you.

1:03:34.181 --> 1:03:35.914
They were tearing
your place apart,

1:03:35.916 --> 1:03:37.818
so I kind of stole it.

1:03:43.157 --> 1:03:44.325
Good luck out there, sir.

1:04:18.058 --> 1:04:19.126
If, uh...

1:04:20.595 --> 1:04:22.394
- If I don't come back...
- You will.

1:04:22.396 --> 1:04:23.464
So, shut up.

1:04:26.066 --> 1:04:27.301
You're just like
your mother.

1:04:28.503 --> 1:04:29.604
Go get them, Pa.

1:04:33.273 --> 1:04:34.674
Ready engine one.

1:04:34.676 --> 1:04:36.341
Ready engine two.

1:04:36.343 --> 1:04:38.477
Clear skies.
Ready for take-off.

1:04:38.479 --> 1:04:40.147
Hold on.
Someone's coming.

1:05:40.073 --> 1:05:42.274
Two minutes!

1:05:44.077 --> 1:05:45.078
Gather up.

1:05:46.514 --> 1:05:49.247
We got a one-hour window
before the cavalry comes in.

1:05:49.249 --> 1:05:50.482
Maybe less.

1:05:50.484 --> 1:05:53.621
Remember, you only need one
confession to stop all this.

1:05:56.089 --> 1:05:57.090
Tino?

1:06:02.129 --> 1:06:05.798
Our best point of entry
is the holding area, here.

1:06:05.800 --> 1:06:09.167
But in order to get there, we have to
circle around the construction sites, here,

1:06:09.169 --> 1:06:11.036
and the trucking hold, here.

1:06:11.038 --> 1:06:13.438
It's our best bet in making
it to the Tower alive.

1:06:13.440 --> 1:06:14.676
We'll split into four teams.

1:06:15.810 --> 1:06:17.309
Ethan, you're the key.

1:06:17.311 --> 1:06:18.611
Go to the main
control room.

1:06:18.613 --> 1:06:19.879
Override the system.

1:06:19.881 --> 1:06:23.348
Lock down their security gates,
doors, and helipad access.

1:06:23.350 --> 1:06:26.084
You open only the ones leading
up to the VIP chambers.

1:06:26.086 --> 1:06:28.688
- You got all that?
- Any backup, sir?

1:06:28.690 --> 1:06:30.123
You're on your own
this time, kid.

1:06:31.158 --> 1:06:32.159
Yes, sir.

1:06:32.727 --> 1:06:33.728
Oggi, Tino...

1:06:35.195 --> 1:06:36.598
you guys are in charge
of the explosives.

1:06:37.297 --> 1:06:38.664
Spec?

1:06:38.666 --> 1:06:40.033
South watch tower.

1:06:40.735 --> 1:06:42.202
360 kill zone.

1:06:43.103 --> 1:06:44.704
Bara, you stay with me.

1:06:44.706 --> 1:06:46.373
Millions of lives
are at stake tonight.

1:06:47.474 --> 1:06:48.475
They're counting on us.

1:06:49.309 --> 1:06:50.643
And me...

1:06:50.645 --> 1:06:52.012
I'm counting on you.

1:07:14.134 --> 1:07:15.367
Go, go, go, go!

1:07:15.369 --> 1:07:16.504
Go, go! Go!

1:07:52.840 --> 1:07:54.540
<i>Attention.</i>

1:07:54.542 --> 1:07:56.678
<i>The state of martial law
has been issued.</i>

1:08:20.501 --> 1:08:21.502
<i>In position.</i>

1:08:27.508 --> 1:08:28.574
<i>Clear.</i>

1:08:35.215 --> 1:08:37.518
Three, two, one.
Execute.

1:09:03.310 --> 1:09:04.512
Target neutralized.

1:09:05.680 --> 1:09:06.781
Left, clear.

1:09:07.615 --> 1:09:08.681
Right, clear.

1:09:08.683 --> 1:09:09.684
All clear.

1:09:10.350 --> 1:09:11.984
Hold for visual.

1:09:11.986 --> 1:09:15.623
We got a confirmed,
VIP vehicle exiting compound.

1:09:16.456 --> 1:09:17.592
Positive ID.

1:09:18.026 --> 1:09:19.558
Farid Baskoro.

1:09:19.560 --> 1:09:21.527
- Shit!
- Let him go.

1:09:21.529 --> 1:09:23.698
Remember, we only need one
of the PIRANAS Four anyway.

1:09:24.132 --> 1:09:25.332
Let's do this.

1:09:30.571 --> 1:09:33.639
<i>The
national curfew is in effect.</i>

1:09:33.641 --> 1:09:35.240
It is chaos here
in the city,

1:09:35.242 --> 1:09:37.510
<i>as the nation
is on lockdown,</i>

1:09:37.512 --> 1:09:42.515
<i>the borders closed and a curfew
issued, due to the nationwide manhunt.</i>

1:09:42.517 --> 1:09:44.719
<i>All citizens must
remain indoors until...</i>

1:10:00.702 --> 1:10:02.400
You two, hands up!

1:10:02.402 --> 1:10:03.571
Now! Get...

1:10:05.940 --> 1:10:07.240
Shit.

1:10:58.492 --> 1:10:59.761
I can't believe
I'm doing this.

1:11:10.738 --> 1:11:12.505
Get the strike squad.

1:11:12.507 --> 1:11:13.608
Check the control room.

1:11:29.123 --> 1:11:30.323
Last one up.

1:11:31.025 --> 1:11:32.325
Hope they all work.

1:11:42.870 --> 1:11:44.036
RV's clear.

1:11:44.038 --> 1:11:46.739
Ethan, strike squad
is en route.

1:11:46.741 --> 1:11:49.108
Main exits compromised.

1:11:49.110 --> 1:11:51.344
Ethan, get the hell out
of there now.

1:11:51.946 --> 1:11:53.948
Wait. I need more time.

1:12:03.423 --> 1:12:04.924
Ethan, do you hear me?

1:12:04.926 --> 1:12:06.491
Get out, now!

1:12:06.493 --> 1:12:07.494
Move!

1:12:26.981 --> 1:12:28.581
Shit, he's compromised.

1:12:28.583 --> 1:12:29.949
They're gonna be here
any second.

1:12:29.951 --> 1:12:31.018
Kid, if you hear me...

1:12:32.452 --> 1:12:33.486
we have to go.

1:12:34.755 --> 1:12:35.823
I'm sorry.

1:12:37.124 --> 1:12:38.524
Do it.

1:12:43.531 --> 1:12:44.799
Sons of bitches!

1:12:46.000 --> 1:12:47.600
No!

1:12:47.602 --> 1:12:48.667
It's a distraction.

1:12:48.669 --> 1:12:49.802
<i>Security breach.</i>

1:12:49.804 --> 1:12:51.639
They're here
for the VIPs.

1:12:52.607 --> 1:12:54.041
Go to the construction site.

1:12:54.709 --> 1:12:55.710
You stop them.

1:12:56.611 --> 1:12:57.745
You heard him!

1:12:58.179 --> 1:12:59.477
Let's move out!

1:13:34.481 --> 1:13:35.482
I'll hold them off.

1:13:36.416 --> 1:13:38.519
They're gonna catch up on us
and you know it!

1:13:39.887 --> 1:13:42.823
Me and this butter face,
we got unfinished business.

1:13:43.724 --> 1:13:44.892
Guess I'll see you inside.

1:14:00.274 --> 1:14:03.644
Why don't you tell
your friends to come out?

1:14:06.814 --> 1:14:08.516
I have no friends.

1:14:10.184 --> 1:14:11.552
No weapons.

1:14:14.855 --> 1:14:16.023
No vest.

1:14:21.095 --> 1:14:22.096
Just me.

1:14:23.030 --> 1:14:24.799
If that's how
you want it.

1:14:26.133 --> 1:14:27.902
You're gonna shoot
an unarmed man?

1:14:28.569 --> 1:14:30.235
Come on.

1:14:30.237 --> 1:14:32.137
Put a bruise on me.

1:14:32.139 --> 1:14:34.642
Break my arm...
something.

1:14:35.343 --> 1:14:36.877
Let's make
this simple, then.

1:14:38.212 --> 1:14:40.881
All of you against me.

1:14:41.615 --> 1:14:44.685
Holster your weapons.

1:14:46.220 --> 1:14:50.124
Let's show this clown
what pain really feels like.

1:14:56.831 --> 1:14:59.698
Damn. I don't
have all day.

1:15:32.633 --> 1:15:33.734
Get the fuck up.

1:16:34.829 --> 1:16:35.830
Hell...

1:16:36.997 --> 1:16:38.132
three out of five.

1:16:39.166 --> 1:16:41.333
Ain't bad.

1:17:01.722 --> 1:17:03.124
Gotta hand it to you.

1:17:04.024 --> 1:17:06.125
You got some spirit.

1:17:06.127 --> 1:17:08.829
Still breathing, asshole.

1:17:28.749 --> 1:17:30.951
You wanted me
to break your arm.

1:17:41.996 --> 1:17:43.364
Wash your mouth.

1:17:46.133 --> 1:17:46.999
What did you say?

1:17:47.001 --> 1:17:48.903
You should wash
your fucking mouth!

1:18:13.360 --> 1:18:14.895
<i>Security breach.</i>

1:18:18.866 --> 1:18:20.134
<i>Security breach.</i>

1:18:24.271 --> 1:18:25.839
<i>Security breach.</i>

1:18:28.510 --> 1:18:29.810
We got activity.

1:18:48.062 --> 1:18:49.296
Kodiaks!

1:19:01.408 --> 1:19:03.075
Covering fire!

1:19:07.582 --> 1:19:09.850
- Frags out!
- Frags out!

1:19:34.208 --> 1:19:35.909
Fuck, I'm hit! I'm hit!

1:19:42.416 --> 1:19:44.182
Armor's blind
without the camera.

1:19:44.184 --> 1:19:45.951
<i>Spec, tell me
you got a visual.</i>

1:19:45.953 --> 1:19:47.221
- Sniper, top side.
- Go!

1:19:48.188 --> 1:19:49.189
Let's go, let's go.

1:19:53.494 --> 1:19:54.862
<i>Spec,
take their camera out.</i>

1:19:57.965 --> 1:19:59.199
Spec, you're breaking up.

1:20:02.036 --> 1:20:03.037
Ogs!

1:20:05.005 --> 1:20:06.006
<i>Spec, take the shot.</i>

1:20:07.207 --> 1:20:08.842
<i>Spec, take
the fucking shot!</i>

1:20:30.565 --> 1:20:31.932
Hey, fatso!

1:20:32.534 --> 1:20:33.535
Ogs!

1:20:43.911 --> 1:20:44.912
Ogs.

1:20:45.346 --> 1:20:46.347
Ogs.

1:20:50.217 --> 1:20:51.218
No, no, no.

1:20:55.055 --> 1:20:58.025
Left vest pocket.

1:21:00.928 --> 1:21:03.631
- What?
- Left vest pocket.

1:21:09.370 --> 1:21:11.103
I'm gonna get you
some help, Ogs.

1:21:11.105 --> 1:21:12.239
You...

1:21:13.407 --> 1:21:15.577
are gonna clear up
this whole mess...

1:21:16.377 --> 1:21:17.545
right, LT?

1:21:18.278 --> 1:21:20.147
You're gonna
save those people.

1:21:21.148 --> 1:21:22.149
Right?

1:21:23.450 --> 1:21:24.586
Damn right, we are.

1:21:26.588 --> 1:21:29.189
I must be
such a disappointment.

1:21:32.694 --> 1:21:33.959
<i>Security breach.</i>

1:21:33.961 --> 1:21:35.362
They're coming.

1:21:36.631 --> 1:21:38.296
We gotta go.

1:21:38.298 --> 1:21:39.464
<i>Security breach.</i>

1:21:39.466 --> 1:21:40.467
We gotta go!

1:21:43.538 --> 1:21:44.905
<i>Security breach.</i>

1:21:49.143 --> 1:21:50.244
<i>Security breach.</i>

1:22:41.796 --> 1:22:43.197
Congressman!

1:22:44.231 --> 1:22:46.131
Commander Adnan.

1:22:46.133 --> 1:22:48.668
This ends now!

1:22:48.670 --> 1:22:50.037
The Four...

1:22:51.573 --> 1:22:53.071
They're gonna get away.

1:22:53.073 --> 1:22:54.074
Both of us...

1:22:55.175 --> 1:22:56.241
we're gonna finish this.

1:22:56.243 --> 1:22:58.176
If you really
believe in this,

1:22:58.178 --> 1:22:59.614
then you better
hurry the fuck up.

1:23:01.081 --> 1:23:03.048
An elevator...

1:23:03.050 --> 1:23:05.118
It'll take you straight
to the VIP chamber.

1:23:07.120 --> 1:23:08.355
I'll see you
on the other side.

1:23:24.371 --> 1:23:25.538
He's breaking in!

1:23:25.540 --> 1:23:26.606
Split up!

1:23:26.608 --> 1:23:27.609
On me!

1:25:40.508 --> 1:25:41.609
Game over.

1:26:12.674 --> 1:26:13.675
What?

1:26:14.809 --> 1:26:16.243
No, no, no, no.

1:26:24.852 --> 1:26:25.920
Move, move!

1:26:39.701 --> 1:26:41.268
Come on,
you sons of bitches.

1:27:25.947 --> 1:27:28.448
Every man for himself.

1:28:34.048 --> 1:28:36.414
Unbelievable.

1:28:36.416 --> 1:28:38.719
How many lives do
you got, Congressman?

1:29:07.081 --> 1:29:08.647
LT, come on.

1:29:08.649 --> 1:29:09.949
Ethan?

1:29:09.951 --> 1:29:11.018
Get behind me!

1:29:18.659 --> 1:29:20.094
Get that hatch opened.

1:29:31.739 --> 1:29:34.441
Wait.
Don't kill me!

1:29:34.909 --> 1:29:36.842
Down on the floor!

1:29:36.844 --> 1:29:38.411
Get down on the floor
right now!

1:29:42.717 --> 1:29:44.984
Confess PIRANAS'
conspiracy on record.

1:29:44.986 --> 1:29:49.121
Authorize your company and
broadcast it live, nationwide.

1:29:49.123 --> 1:29:51.891
Are you fucking crazy?

1:29:51.893 --> 1:29:54.161
They'll put me in front
of the firing squad.

1:29:56.764 --> 1:29:58.063
Authorize it.

1:29:58.065 --> 1:29:59.066
Make the call.

1:30:08.242 --> 1:30:10.242
It's me.

1:30:10.244 --> 1:30:12.511
There'll be an incoming
video upload

1:30:12.513 --> 1:30:14.713
through the central
PIRANAS server.

1:30:14.715 --> 1:30:17.018
Just broadcast it as soon
as you receive it.

1:30:17.752 --> 1:30:18.819
Nationwide.

1:30:19.486 --> 1:30:20.686
Live.

1:30:20.688 --> 1:30:24.123
"Do it, or your ass
is fired."

1:30:24.125 --> 1:30:26.627
Do it, or your ass
is fired.

1:30:31.599 --> 1:30:32.600
Confess.

1:30:37.104 --> 1:30:40.141
<i>My name
is Hengky Laksono.</i>

1:30:40.975 --> 1:30:42.176
I am here tonight...

1:30:42.743 --> 1:30:44.045
to tell...

1:31:05.066 --> 1:31:06.567
- Ethan, no!
- Stop.

1:31:10.538 --> 1:31:11.605
Just stop.

1:31:27.722 --> 1:31:30.289
What the hell
happened here?

1:31:30.291 --> 1:31:32.224
Relax, Mr. President.

1:31:32.226 --> 1:31:34.193
Everything is under control.

1:31:34.195 --> 1:31:36.964
Systems back online and
Garuda One is ready to go.

1:31:44.972 --> 1:31:46.540
Congressman Angga.

1:31:48.576 --> 1:31:50.511
You used to have everything.

1:31:52.580 --> 1:31:53.647
But now...

1:31:55.249 --> 1:31:57.082
you're just like them.

1:31:57.084 --> 1:31:59.153
I never planned
for a genocide!

1:32:00.354 --> 1:32:01.653
You and your
PIRANAS flag did that!

1:32:01.655 --> 1:32:05.292
But I'm not the one who's
committing genocide, Congressman!

1:32:07.028 --> 1:32:08.229
The people are!

1:32:09.930 --> 1:32:12.331
You fed them a lie,
for God's sake!

1:32:12.333 --> 1:32:16.037
Great things are done
with extreme measures.

1:32:17.038 --> 1:32:18.806
You showed us that tonight.

1:32:20.207 --> 1:32:22.341
Destroyed the enemy's image,

1:32:22.343 --> 1:32:24.610
restored the people's
faith in us.

1:32:24.612 --> 1:32:27.548
All in less
than a week.

1:32:28.382 --> 1:32:30.584
Brilliant, Congressman.

1:32:31.352 --> 1:32:32.686
Brilliant.

1:32:33.687 --> 1:32:35.256
Now, if you please
excuse me...

1:32:36.690 --> 1:32:38.559
I have a public
to address.

1:32:39.193 --> 1:32:40.261
My, uh...

1:32:40.995 --> 1:32:44.198
"Heroic Act,"
as you call it.

1:32:45.132 --> 1:32:47.001
Goodnight, Congressman.

1:33:10.758 --> 1:33:12.593
And he's gone.

1:33:14.395 --> 1:33:15.696
It's over.

1:33:17.031 --> 1:33:18.397
Now, tell me.

1:33:18.399 --> 1:33:19.733
Was she worth it?

1:33:22.203 --> 1:33:24.103
Did you really think
people would stop

1:33:24.105 --> 1:33:26.807
just because of some
stupid confession video?

1:33:28.275 --> 1:33:30.377
Those primitive
will burn,

1:33:31.045 --> 1:33:32.744
steal,

1:33:32.746 --> 1:33:35.082
rape and kill
all they want.

1:33:36.117 --> 1:33:37.118
You know why?

1:33:40.221 --> 1:33:43.021
Because the hungry
cares not for justice.

1:33:43.023 --> 1:33:44.658
Only for their
own stomach.

1:33:46.694 --> 1:33:47.795
But you're wrong.

1:33:49.396 --> 1:33:50.731
What they care for...

1:33:52.399 --> 1:33:54.001
is to see you dead!

1:33:57.171 --> 1:33:59.006
Get the fuck
out of here!

1:35:44.845 --> 1:35:46.247
Will you look at that?

1:35:47.248 --> 1:35:48.313
Huh?

1:35:48.315 --> 1:35:49.450
Last bullet!

1:35:50.184 --> 1:35:53.220
Oh, don't look
at me like that.

1:35:53.854 --> 1:35:56.023
You think
I'm the bad guy?

1:35:57.891 --> 1:36:02.196
You have no idea what monsters
this world can create!

1:36:02.997 --> 1:36:04.265
You chose them!

1:36:05.232 --> 1:36:07.201
So, bleed for them!

1:36:13.841 --> 1:36:16.043
Pleasure working with
you again, Lieutenant!

1:36:23.951 --> 1:36:26.885
PIRANAS! PIRANAS!

1:36:26.887 --> 1:36:28.353
PIRANAS!

1:36:28.355 --> 1:36:29.855
PIRANAS!

1:36:29.857 --> 1:36:31.256
PIRANAS!

1:36:31.258 --> 1:36:32.259
PIRANAS!

1:36:47.174 --> 1:36:49.443
<i>My beloved countrymen...</i>

1:36:51.178 --> 1:36:52.313
<i>this morning...</i>

1:36:53.947 --> 1:36:55.981
<i>the Reform
has committed</i>

1:36:55.983 --> 1:36:59.918
<i>their most heinous and
cowardly act of terror.</i>

1:37:02.256 --> 1:37:03.558
<i>I am angry.</i>

1:37:05.359 --> 1:37:06.592
<i>I am furious!</i>

1:37:10.297 --> 1:37:14.567
<i>With this law,
every citizen...</i>

1:37:14.569 --> 1:37:19.306
<i>is now legally responsible
for all members of the Reform.</i>

1:37:21.241 --> 1:37:26.512
<i>Starting tonight,
your hunger will be fulfilled!</i>

1:37:28.616 --> 1:37:34.088
<i>We will hunt down those
separatist traitors to the ground!</i>

1:37:35.222 --> 1:37:38.223
<i>So, let
the manhunt begin!</i>

1:37:38.225 --> 1:37:39.491
PIRANAS!

1:37:39.493 --> 1:37:40.961
PIRANAS!

1:38:14.562 --> 1:38:15.630
Done with it.

1:38:16.997 --> 1:38:18.098
So...

1:38:19.099 --> 1:38:20.234
done with it.

1:38:43.490 --> 1:38:46.291
PIRANAS! PIRANAS!

1:38:46.293 --> 1:38:47.627
PIRANAS!

1:38:47.629 --> 1:38:49.194
PIRANAS!

1:38:49.196 --> 1:38:50.598
PIRANAS!

1:38:57.672 --> 1:38:59.641
<i>You used to have everything.</i>

1:39:01.408 --> 1:39:02.510
What is this?

1:39:04.144 --> 1:39:05.279
Who put this up?

1:39:06.046 --> 1:39:07.147
<i>But now...</i>

1:39:08.382 --> 1:39:09.584
<i>you're just like them.</i>

1:39:11.185 --> 1:39:12.518
<i>I never planned
for a genocide!</i>

1:39:12.520 --> 1:39:15.287
- Hey, shut it down.
- <i>You and your PIRANAS flag did that!</i>

1:39:15.289 --> 1:39:16.254
- Shut it down, now.
- <i>But I'm not the one</i>

1:39:16.256 --> 1:39:18.593
<i>who's committing genocide,
Congressman!</i>

1:39:19.761 --> 1:39:21.326
<i>The people are!</i>

1:39:21.328 --> 1:39:22.461
You lied to us!

1:39:22.463 --> 1:39:23.698
<i>Good citizens...</i>

1:39:25.332 --> 1:39:26.333
<i>Hear me.</i>

1:39:27.434 --> 1:39:29.468
<i>This is a setup.</i>

1:39:29.470 --> 1:39:32.072
<i>Just another of those
Reform's plots.</i>

1:39:39.313 --> 1:39:40.481
<i>And, listen...</i>

1:39:46.253 --> 1:39:47.988
<i>Get me out
of here, now!</i>

1:40:47.414 --> 1:40:48.583
Get out of my way.

1:41:01.295 --> 1:41:03.765
I said, get the fuck
out of my way.

1:41:24.151 --> 1:41:25.483
That motherfucker.

1:42:00.922 --> 1:42:04.422
<i>It's been a week since the
President's infamous confession leaked</i>

1:42:04.424 --> 1:42:05.925
<i>and went viral.</i>

1:42:05.927 --> 1:42:08.527
<i>The President
and his administration</i>

1:42:08.529 --> 1:42:10.730
<i>are being labeled
as suspects,</i>

1:42:10.732 --> 1:42:13.899
<i>and will be put on trial
sometime next week.</i>

1:42:13.901 --> 1:42:15.534
<i>The question
still remains,</i>

1:42:15.536 --> 1:42:17.872
<i>is the President
a patriot or a traitor?</i>

1:42:18.338 --> 1:42:19.471
<i>But recently,</i>

1:42:19.473 --> 1:42:23.609
<i>there may be arguably
bigger questions at play.</i>

1:42:23.611 --> 1:42:26.179
<i>Who is this man
behind the camera?</i>

1:42:27.447 --> 1:42:28.914
<i>Who the people
are now calling,</i>

1:42:28.916 --> 1:42:32.250
<i>"the hero of
the new Republic."</i>

1:42:32.252 --> 1:42:35.621
<i>We now know that his
name is Ethan Suryadi,</i>

1:42:35.623 --> 1:42:39.359
<i>a former Indonesian Marine
officer turned small-time vlogger.</i>

1:42:41.896 --> 1:42:43.564
<i>Did Ethan work alone?</i>

1:42:44.732 --> 1:42:46.233
<i>Who else was involved?</i>

1:42:47.802 --> 1:42:49.300
<i>It seems like
we'll be getting</i>

1:42:49.302 --> 1:42:50.938
<i>more questions
than answers.</i>

1:42:52.006 --> 1:42:53.373
<i>At least, for now.</i>

1:43:12.292 --> 1:43:13.592
Good look on you.

1:43:14.962 --> 1:43:16.531
Not so bad yourself.

1:43:19.433 --> 1:43:21.634
I guess you found
Spec's body.

1:43:21.636 --> 1:43:22.702
No.

1:43:22.704 --> 1:43:25.771
It was just blood.
Lots of it.

1:43:25.773 --> 1:43:26.974
He couldn't have survived it.

1:43:28.943 --> 1:43:30.310
And Tino?

1:43:31.546 --> 1:43:32.712
Bailed.

1:43:32.714 --> 1:43:34.880
No goodbye, nothing.

1:43:34.882 --> 1:43:36.383
Who knows
what he's up to.

1:43:54.502 --> 1:43:55.503
Excuse me.

1:44:05.947 --> 1:44:07.548
Permission to return this.

1:44:09.917 --> 1:44:11.318
In honor
of your son, ma'am.

1:44:21.394 --> 1:44:22.563
You were with him.

1:44:25.099 --> 1:44:26.433
What was he like?

1:44:29.804 --> 1:44:31.271
Best man
I've known, ma'am.

1:44:34.509 --> 1:44:35.676
Best man I'll ever know.

1:44:38.980 --> 1:44:40.347
That's my son.

1:45:21.055 --> 1:45:22.056
Hungry?

1:45:26.127 --> 1:45:27.327
No.

1:45:28.563 --> 1:45:29.664
No, I'm good.

1:45:32.499 --> 1:45:33.634
The book you gave me...

1:45:35.069 --> 1:45:38.904
The fox pin and the last
pages were burned in the fire.

1:45:38.906 --> 1:45:40.741
Guess I'll never know
the ending.

1:45:43.778 --> 1:45:45.445
We'll just have to
make our own, then.

1:45:48.415 --> 1:45:49.482
Won't we?

1:45:56.456 --> 1:45:59.124
<i>Food for all! Food for all!</i>

1:45:59.126 --> 1:46:01.861
<i>Food for all!
Food for all!</i>

1:46:01.863 --> 1:46:04.730
<i>Food for all!
Food for all!</i>

1:46:04.732 --> 1:46:07.600
<i>Food for all!
Food for all!</i>

1:46:07.602 --> 1:46:10.037
<i>Food for all!
Food for all...</i>

1:54:01.008 --> 1:54:03.043
- Whoa.
- Shit.

1:54:05.346 --> 1:54:08.146
When's the last time
you had chocolate?

1:54:08.148 --> 1:54:10.117
When's the last time
we could afford it?
