WEBVTT

00:11.875 --> 00:14.542
- You ready? Yeah.
- Yes.

00:14.625 --> 00:16.417
Here it comes!
Here it comes!

00:16.500 --> 00:17.875
Run, Vivian, run!

00:17.959 --> 00:20.542
I'm gonna get you.

00:20.625 --> 00:22.125
I'm gonna get you.

00:25.250 --> 00:26.375
Whoa, here she comes.

00:26.458 --> 00:28.500
(Vivian)
'Go higher! Go higher!'

00:30.792 --> 00:32.750
Whee!

00:32.834 --> 00:35.458
Coming in for a landing!

00:37.667 --> 00:39.417
It's a perfect day.

00:39.500 --> 00:41.250
Now, we should think
about heading back.

00:41.333 --> 00:43.500
No, I don't wanna go home.

00:43.583 --> 00:45.000
It's getting late, Vivian.

00:45.083 --> 00:48.458
Why can't we
just stay here
forever?

00:50.041 --> 00:51.542
Okay, close your eyes.

00:52.709 --> 00:55.375
Come on.
Please?

00:56.792 --> 00:59.458
Okay, listen
really, really hard.

00:59.542 --> 01:01.083
Do you hear the ocean?

01:01.166 --> 01:03.208
Mm-hmm.

01:03.291 --> 01:04.875
Now, look,
but don't open your eyes.

01:04.959 --> 01:07.625
Can you see it?

01:07.709 --> 01:09.875
It'll always be here for you.

01:09.959 --> 01:11.959
No one can ever take it away.

01:12.041 --> 01:16.166
Because it'll always be
right in here.

01:17.959 --> 01:19.709
Forever.

01:19.792 --> 01:21.208
Our perfect day.

01:21.291 --> 01:23.458
Forever?

01:23.542 --> 01:25.125
And ever.

01:49.792 --> 01:52.375
(Stillman)
'Some bum out fishing
this morning got a bite.'

01:52.458 --> 01:54.000
(Rush)
'Floater in the water?'

01:54.083 --> 01:56.500
(Stillman)
'No, a hand
from the river bottom.'

01:56.583 --> 01:58.208
(Valens)
That's the way to
jump-start the AM.

01:58.291 --> 01:59.834
That was a kid.

01:59.917 --> 02:02.542
Female, probably white,
three to five years old.

02:02.625 --> 02:04.583
Been under for maybe, decades.

02:04.667 --> 02:06.041
Cause of death?

02:06.125 --> 02:08.208
Too early to tell, but
she's got crushed vertebrae

02:08.291 --> 02:12.166
in the neck area, shattered
skull...and check this out.

02:12.250 --> 02:15.500
Two breaks
on the radius and ulna.

02:15.583 --> 02:17.917
- Forearm bones.
- Overkill?

02:18.000 --> 02:20.041
These are old wounds.
Healed over.

02:20.125 --> 02:22.041
Someone abusing her.

02:22.125 --> 02:24.959
Takes some kinda rage, breaking
a kid's arm in two places.

02:25.041 --> 02:27.375
Some kinda monster.

02:27.458 --> 02:30.417
I'd like to meet whoever's
responsible, face to face.

02:30.500 --> 02:32.834
Hearing you
loud and clear, boss.

02:32.917 --> 02:34.875
Doer better still be out there.

02:36.166 --> 02:38.500
Kinda job you hate
the most to catch

02:38.583 --> 02:41.083
but worth the most to close.

03:18.834 --> 03:21.792
- Miller.
- Oh, crap.

03:21.875 --> 03:24.917
Huh.
I'm tryin' to quit.

03:25.000 --> 03:26.667
Yeah? How's that
goin' for ya?

03:26.750 --> 03:30.333
Do it 20 times a day.
I figure one time's gotta
stick.

03:30.417 --> 03:31.917
Want you to know, I appreciate

03:32.000 --> 03:33.625
your contribution
on the last job.

03:33.709 --> 03:35.166
Glad to be of service.

03:35.250 --> 03:37.291
Good group of folks
you got over there.

03:37.375 --> 03:39.125
You ever consider joining?

03:40.041 --> 03:41.959
Homicide?

03:42.041 --> 03:44.125
You making me an offer?

03:46.542 --> 03:49.041
You got reservations?

03:49.125 --> 03:51.083
Because of fishtown?

03:53.458 --> 03:54.625
You heard about that, huh?

03:54.709 --> 03:57.083
Well, a cop gets
shot,
word gets out.

03:57.166 --> 04:00.000
Well, anyway, uh, I made
my peace with that.

04:00.083 --> 04:01.291
It's just, uh..

04:01.375 --> 04:03.500
...some schedule stuff,
I gotta look at.

04:03.583 --> 04:05.834
Anything I need to know about?

04:05.917 --> 04:08.208
Nothing I can't handle.

04:08.291 --> 04:10.125
You'll get back to me?

04:10.208 --> 04:11.542
Definitely.

04:14.792 --> 04:16.208
Thanks, lieutenant.

04:18.959 --> 04:20.917
According to the lab,
Baby Jane Doe's been

04:21.000 --> 04:23.166
at the bottom of this river
for 40-some years.

04:23.250 --> 04:25.709
Puttin' her murder
sometime in the '60s.

04:25.792 --> 04:28.250
But from '60 to '69, we got
no missing persons report

04:28.333 --> 04:30.125
of a three to five-year-old
white female.

04:30.208 --> 04:32.834
And what kind of family
doesn't
report their kid missing?

04:32.917 --> 04:35.625
The kinda family
that kills their kid?

04:35.709 --> 04:38.291
Maybe, we check
DHS' Child Abuse Unit records.

04:38.375 --> 04:40.834
Kid's doctor might have
reported that broken
arm.

04:40.917 --> 04:42.917
There was no Child Abuse Unit
back then.

04:43.000 --> 04:45.667
Docs weren't trained
to recognize abuse, no one was.

04:45.750 --> 04:48.333
A kid like this would've
fallen
through the cracks easy.

04:48.417 --> 04:49.875
And we got another boy
in the box.

04:49.959 --> 04:51.500
No one ever came forward
to claim him.

04:51.583 --> 04:52.959
(Rush)
'Back then, they didn't have'

04:53.041 --> 04:56.709
facial reconstruction
technology...we do.

04:56.792 --> 04:58.583
So we create a picture
of what the victim

04:58.667 --> 05:00.667
could've looked like,
off the skull.

05:00.750 --> 05:02.125
Put this picture in circulation.

05:02.208 --> 05:03.709
Maybe, an old neighbor,
family member

05:03.792 --> 05:06.291
'recognizes our Baby Jane Doe.'

05:06.375 --> 05:08.291
Needle in a haystack,
but I might've tracked

05:08.375 --> 05:09.875
your victim's fractures.

05:09.959 --> 05:12.583
Two breaks on the forearm,
real unique injury, right?

05:12.667 --> 05:14.083
'Same kind of breaks
were treated'

05:14.166 --> 05:16.917
at St. Boniface's emergency
room, circa 1965.

05:17.000 --> 05:18.417
Does it say who the victim was?

05:18.500 --> 05:21.792
Er, "Vivian Smith.
Age four. White female."

05:21.875 --> 05:24.583
Doc who treated her,
is still alive and kicking.

05:27.792 --> 05:29.208
Yes, that's my signature.

05:29.291 --> 05:32.041
I was in my first year
of residency in '65.

05:32.125 --> 05:33.834
Do you remember
that patient, Dr. Greggs?

05:33.917 --> 05:37.166
Vivian Smith. Four years old,
White female.

05:37.250 --> 05:40.417
Multiple fractures
to the radius, ulna.

05:40.500 --> 05:43.750
Yes, I remember her.

05:43.834 --> 05:45.083
First time I realized

05:45.166 --> 05:47.750
how little I could do
for children like that.

05:47.834 --> 05:49.417
What do you mean?

05:49.500 --> 05:52.417
I'd patch them up, send them
home up until the next time.

05:52.500 --> 05:55.417
We think she was killed
shortly after you treated
her.

05:55.500 --> 05:58.083
Any idea, who might've
been responsible?

05:58.166 --> 05:59.333
Mom.

05:59.417 --> 06:00.667
She brought her in.

06:00.750 --> 06:02.875
A local waitress,
from what I can remember.

06:02.959 --> 06:04.333
There a father in the picture?

06:04.417 --> 06:06.083
Not according to this.

06:06.166 --> 06:10.709
Mom kept insisting
she "dropped" her kid.

06:10.792 --> 06:12.834
(Cindy)
'It just happened so fast.'

06:12.917 --> 06:16.792
I was holding her and then,
next
thing you know, I dropped her.

06:16.875 --> 06:18.125
Dropped her, huh?

06:18.208 --> 06:20.417
How'd that happen,
you dropping her?

06:20.500 --> 06:22.959
Well, silly me.

06:23.041 --> 06:25.750
I think, I need glasses. See,
my eyes, they don't work so
hot.

06:25.834 --> 06:28.083
'And I just keep
dropping things.'

06:28.166 --> 06:29.458
Your daughter has
spiral fractures.

06:29.542 --> 06:31.667
It's caused when
you take a child's
arm..

06:31.750 --> 06:33.291
'...and snap it.'

06:37.750 --> 06:40.125
- Take her away.
- Excuse me?

06:40.208 --> 06:42.291
She's better off without me.

06:42.375 --> 06:43.792
(Dr. Greggs)
'What about your mother's?'

06:43.875 --> 06:46.166
- Or a relative's?
- I don't have anyone.

06:47.542 --> 06:50.750
Please, just take her away
before it's too late.

06:54.709 --> 06:57.709
I can't just take your kid.

06:57.792 --> 07:00.500
You wanna get those eyes
looked at.

07:00.583 --> 07:02.500
(Dr. Greggs)
'Sign for your daughter
here.'

07:06.917 --> 07:09.083
So mom was trying to save
the kid from herself.

07:09.166 --> 07:10.709
(Dr. Greggs)
'There was nothing I could
do.'

07:10.792 --> 07:13.917
Child abuse wasn't even
a concept in '65.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.083
Anyway, mom gave us
a false name.

07:16.166 --> 07:18.041
How did you know that?

07:18.125 --> 07:20.291
Hospital bill came back
a week later.

07:20.375 --> 07:23.000
No known recipient.
No known address.

07:23.083 --> 07:25.417
You said she was a local girl?
A waitress?

07:25.500 --> 07:28.834
- Carhop kinda uniform?
- That's what it looked
like.

07:28.917 --> 07:32.583
Only carhop in Philly is
Milt's
Burger Joint, Thurman Street.

07:32.667 --> 07:34.458
Best cheese fries in town.

07:41.417 --> 07:44.166
Place was a carhop back in '65.

07:44.250 --> 07:46.125
Hey, you worked here
as a waitress, Mattie?

07:46.208 --> 07:48.291
Scrimped and saved
my tips for years

07:48.375 --> 07:50.417
till I could call
this armpit my own.

07:50.500 --> 07:53.542
You remember another waitress
that had a daughter

07:53.625 --> 07:55.542
four years old?

07:55.625 --> 07:58.125
Kid mighta had
a cast on her arm.

07:58.208 --> 08:00.583
Oh, sure.

08:00.667 --> 08:03.166
Cindy...something.

08:03.250 --> 08:05.166
'I don't recall her last name.'

08:05.250 --> 08:07.375
Well, maybe, we have a talk
with the former owner.

08:07.458 --> 08:09.166
Good luck.

08:09.250 --> 08:10.709
Cheap pervert.

08:10.792 --> 08:13.875
Took a nosedive into his
cheese fries ten years back.

08:16.542 --> 08:18.875
What do you remember
about this Cindy?

08:18.959 --> 08:22.583
Restless, skittish kinda
gal.
Type who had it all.

08:22.667 --> 08:26.667
Great husband, great kid.
Wanted nothing to do with them.

08:26.750 --> 08:29.417
- She was married?
- Yes.

08:29.500 --> 08:32.875
Met her husband once.
Heart o'gold type. But
her..

08:32.959 --> 08:37.333
...somethin' was rotten up
in the old spaghetti
factory.

08:58.583 --> 09:00.458
You'll get used to it, honey.

09:00.542 --> 09:05.166
How much money does it
take to, uh...run away?

09:05.250 --> 09:08.291
Run away? What would you
wanna run away for, honey?

09:08.375 --> 09:10.166
Don't you have a family?

09:10.250 --> 09:12.166
I'm a bad mother.

09:12.250 --> 09:14.291
Oh, you don't mean that now.

09:14.375 --> 09:18.125
Sometimes, I think my only way
out is when one of them dies.

09:20.625 --> 09:21.583
Sweetheart?

09:25.208 --> 09:26.875
What are you
doing here,
Roger?

09:26.959 --> 09:28.208
Why aren't you at work?

09:28.291 --> 09:30.166
I wanted to see my girls.

09:30.250 --> 09:32.291
(Vivian)
'Mommy! Mommy!'

09:32.375 --> 09:34.458
Look what daddy got me!

09:34.542 --> 09:37.792
Oh, Vivian,
she's
beautiful.

09:37.875 --> 09:40.458
I got a white paw
just like Snowflake!

09:43.417 --> 09:46.375
Stay in the car, sweetie.
Let mommy and daddy talk.

09:48.000 --> 09:52.041
- She's gonna be okay, Cindy.
- How can you say that?

09:52.125 --> 09:55.041
The most important thing
is that we work this out.

09:55.125 --> 09:56.709
As a family.

09:57.917 --> 10:01.709
- I can't.
- You're her mommy.

10:01.792 --> 10:06.000
And nothing's
ever gonna change that.

10:06.083 --> 10:08.333
She needs you.

10:08.417 --> 10:10.291
I need you.

10:19.500 --> 10:23.291
Had that man wrapped
around her little finger.

10:23.375 --> 10:25.500
Sounds like
she was about to bolt.

10:25.583 --> 10:29.250
And he was desperate
to keep her. At any cost.

10:29.333 --> 10:31.166
Lil, boss called.

10:32.458 --> 10:34.125
Thanks for your time, Mattie.

10:36.083 --> 10:37.417
They put those facial
reconstruction photos

10:37.500 --> 10:38.667
of Baby Jane Doe out.

10:38.750 --> 10:40.208
- That was fast.
- Got a hit.

10:40.291 --> 10:43.375
Lady came in five minutes
ago.
Says she knows our girl.

10:48.375 --> 10:51.542
I was just leaving
the courthouse when I saw
this.

10:51.625 --> 10:54.709
You work at the PD's office,
Ms. Stanton?

10:54.792 --> 10:56.458
Court reporter.

10:56.542 --> 10:58.125
(Valens)
'You saying you know this
girl?'

10:58.208 --> 11:00.834
No. I mean,
yes.
I think I do.

11:00.917 --> 11:03.917
- Can I ask a question?
- Sure.

11:04.000 --> 11:07.208
Rumor has it, you found
her
in the river.

11:07.291 --> 11:08.792
Yes. We did.

11:08.875 --> 11:10.375
How did she die?

11:12.000 --> 11:13.542
We're not sure yet.

11:14.583 --> 11:17.291
Anyway, cut to the chase.

11:22.500 --> 11:25.792
- It's a pretty close match.
- Where'd you get this photo?

11:25.875 --> 11:28.750
It's one of the few things
I have left from my
childhood.

11:28.834 --> 11:29.959
How do you mean?

11:30.041 --> 11:32.250
That little girl
in the photo..

11:32.333 --> 11:34.917
That girl is me.

11:42.667 --> 11:45.000
I was adopted when I was four.

11:45.083 --> 11:47.667
There's very little
I remember before then.

11:47.750 --> 11:50.583
But I always felt
a part of me was missing.

11:50.667 --> 11:54.333
Do you remember her at all?

11:54.417 --> 11:58.959
I remember a girl, but I
thought
she was my invisible friend.

11:59.041 --> 12:00.250
Something a child makes up.

12:00.333 --> 12:02.417
I never thought
she could be
real.

12:02.500 --> 12:05.500
Well, we'll need to take
a swab, test your DNA

12:05.583 --> 12:07.542
against our Baby Jane Doe.

12:07.625 --> 12:10.959
So the girl
you found in the
river..

12:11.041 --> 12:12.458
...she could have
been
my sister.

12:12.542 --> 12:14.291
It's possible.

12:15.542 --> 12:17.041
What about your parents?

12:17.125 --> 12:18.750
Do you remember them?

12:20.875 --> 12:24.000
Last time I saw my mother..

12:24.083 --> 12:26.375
...that's the only memory
I have.

12:39.709 --> 12:42.166
Where's Vivian, mommy?

12:43.750 --> 12:46.041
Listen to me, sweetheart.

12:46.125 --> 12:50.458
Vivian...she's just
someone
you made up in your mind.

12:50.542 --> 12:53.166
Like an invisible friend.

12:53.250 --> 12:55.375
Vivian's just make-believe?

12:55.458 --> 12:57.375
Don't you see?

12:57.458 --> 12:59.500
It's so much better this way.

12:59.583 --> 13:01.500
Because, she'll
always be with
you.

13:01.583 --> 13:04.500
Watching over you,
no matter where you
go.

13:04.583 --> 13:06.333
Like an angel?

13:08.792 --> 13:11.834
Yes, like an angel.

13:13.125 --> 13:15.000
Go to sleep
now,
sweetheart.

13:15.083 --> 13:17.041
Close your eyes.

13:20.875 --> 13:23.792
You'll be in good hands here.

13:23.875 --> 13:26.375
You're better off without me.

13:27.750 --> 13:29.542
He'll keep you safe.

13:29.625 --> 13:33.458
And whenever it seems
mommy's far, far
away..

13:33.542 --> 13:36.041
...all you have to
do is
close your eyes.

13:36.125 --> 13:38.250
'And I'll be here with you.'

13:46.792 --> 13:49.083
Forever?

13:49.166 --> 13:50.667
And ever.

13:52.959 --> 13:54.250
Bye-bye, baby.

14:00.041 --> 14:02.208
I never saw her again.

14:02.291 --> 14:04.417
DHS found me a home.

14:04.500 --> 14:06.458
Good, loving people raised
me.
I was lucky.

14:06.542 --> 14:10.125
And that medallion your mother
gave you, do you still have it?

14:10.208 --> 14:11.709
I do, yeah.

14:17.041 --> 14:19.583
She mentioned a man
watching over you.

14:19.667 --> 14:21.709
"He'll keep you safe," she said.

14:21.792 --> 14:26.583
St. Michael.
Maybe that's what she meant.

14:26.667 --> 14:29.709
'"BN 3546."'

14:29.792 --> 14:31.750
Always wondered what that meant.

14:31.834 --> 14:34.917
St. Michael's
the patron saint of cops.

14:35.000 --> 14:37.417
"BN" could mean badge number.

14:39.583 --> 14:41.959
I'll let you know if
there's
something to it, Maura.

14:42.875 --> 14:44.166
Thanks for your time.

14:44.250 --> 14:46.166
I've had a good life.

14:46.250 --> 14:49.458
But still..

14:49.542 --> 14:51.125
...I'd like to know.

14:52.458 --> 14:54.291
Why she left.

15:02.542 --> 15:04.083
Art Balducci?

15:06.542 --> 15:09.125
No need to
shine
them badges.

15:09.208 --> 15:11.041
Cheery mugs give you boys away.

15:11.125 --> 15:13.250
Takes a cop to know a cop.

15:13.333 --> 15:15.041
Badge number 3546.

15:15.125 --> 15:17.667
Hung up the uniform
20 years ago.

15:17.750 --> 15:19.000
Good riddance.

15:19.083 --> 15:21.959
Ever run across this girl
on the job?

15:22.041 --> 15:23.625
Looks
familiar.
Who is she?

15:23.709 --> 15:25.333
Kid who had this.

15:30.375 --> 15:32.792
My St. Michael's.
Where'd you find it?

15:32.875 --> 15:34.583
Same little girl,
all grown up now.

15:34.667 --> 15:37.125
That a fact?

15:37.208 --> 15:39.709
Yeah.
Now I remember her.

15:39.792 --> 15:43.166
Her
sister.
Twins.

15:43.250 --> 15:44.542
You close with the family?

15:44.625 --> 15:46.792
No. Met 'em once. That's it.

15:46.875 --> 15:49.417
So why'd you give her
your medallion?

15:49.500 --> 15:54.417
I was a rookie, see.
We got a call to this
house.

15:54.500 --> 15:57.417
Neighbors are complaining
'cause of the noise.

15:59.083 --> 16:00.291
Police!

16:00.375 --> 16:02.083
Open up!

16:08.208 --> 16:10.542
Police. Open up.

16:13.250 --> 16:14.583
Can I help you, officers?

16:14.667 --> 16:16.834
We got a noise complaint.

16:16.917 --> 16:18.875
(officer)
'Everything okay here?'

16:18.959 --> 16:20.458
(Roger)
'We're sitting down to a
meal.'

16:20.542 --> 16:22.125
Ain't that right, sweetheart?

16:22.208 --> 16:24.250
It's Hawaiian casserole night.

16:24.333 --> 16:27.208
It's mm-mm good, right, girls?

16:27.291 --> 16:29.166
Don't want to disturb
your evening, eh, folks.

16:29.250 --> 16:31.667
- Have a good night.
- Everything okay here, ma'am?

16:31.750 --> 16:35.041
I'm just fine. Thank you.

16:35.125 --> 16:38.625
- What'd you do to her?
- Shut up, kid. Let's go.

16:38.709 --> 16:41.041
He beat her.
On her face.

16:41.125 --> 16:44.583
No.
No, I just, I
fell.

16:44.667 --> 16:48.166
'It's...my eyes.
They don't work very well.'

16:48.250 --> 16:51.250
I-I think I need glasses.

16:51.333 --> 16:53.417
Let's take a walk
around the block.

16:53.500 --> 16:54.959
Cool your engines.

16:55.041 --> 16:57.166
Yeah, sure.

17:01.667 --> 17:03.792
Get yourself cleaned up, lady.

17:06.166 --> 17:10.083
Daddy's gonna come back
to make mommy cry again.

17:12.667 --> 17:15.208
Do you know who this is?

17:15.291 --> 17:18.542
It's St. Michael. He's
the
patron saint of
mommies.

17:18.625 --> 17:22.333
He keeps an eye on 'em. And he
never lets them come to harm.

17:22.417 --> 17:24.583
- Really?
- Sure.

17:24.667 --> 17:27.959
Go on. Put it on your mommy.

17:28.041 --> 17:29.667
What do you say, Maura?

17:29.750 --> 17:31.500
Thank you.

17:43.000 --> 17:44.792
It's time for your bath, girls.

17:47.917 --> 17:50.291
I should give this back to you.

17:50.375 --> 17:51.709
Oh, no, no, keep it.

17:51.792 --> 17:54.166
Your girls will notice
if it's gone.

17:54.250 --> 17:56.583
That's very kind of you.

17:56.667 --> 17:58.375
- Thank you.
- Sure.

17:58.458 --> 18:00.959
Oh, I'm Cindy Mulvaney.

18:01.041 --> 18:03.250
Pleased to meet you.

18:03.333 --> 18:05.792
I think you see
just fine, ma'am.

18:05.875 --> 18:07.333
Pardon me?

18:07.417 --> 18:09.750
Situations like this..

18:09.834 --> 18:12.375
...they always end up bad.

18:12.458 --> 18:15.291
You need to take
your girls and leave.

18:15.375 --> 18:19.625
- Tonight.
- And go where?

18:19.709 --> 18:22.250
My parents are
dead.
I'm an only child.

18:22.333 --> 18:24.625
And I haven't had
a friend in years.

18:24.709 --> 18:28.333
So please, tell me
where should I go.

18:28.417 --> 18:30.875
If you need a place to go..

18:30.959 --> 18:32.750
...you call this number.

18:37.250 --> 18:40.458
(Valens)
'So it was her husband
abusing the girls.'

18:40.542 --> 18:41.834
Not her.

18:41.917 --> 18:43.375
She was covering it up.

18:43.458 --> 18:45.291
They always do.

18:45.375 --> 18:47.291
So what was this number
you gave her?

18:47.375 --> 18:48.709
Some kind of shelter?

18:48.792 --> 18:50.208
No shelters back then.

18:50.291 --> 18:52.542
Just a few good samaritans
who knew what it was like

18:52.625 --> 18:54.250
being on the receiving end
of a fist.

18:54.333 --> 18:56.000
So she call this number?

18:56.083 --> 18:58.792
Got me.
Never heard from her again.

18:58.875 --> 19:00.959
No way she would've turned to
the police for help after
that.

19:01.041 --> 19:03.083
Police.

19:03.166 --> 19:05.709
Her husband was the police.

19:05.792 --> 19:09.125
Roger Mulvaney was
a cop in my precinct.

19:16.917 --> 19:18.875
Her husband was a cop
in the 14th district

19:18.959 --> 19:20.333
and a bona fide hero.

19:20.417 --> 19:21.583
Decorated twice for valor.

19:21.667 --> 19:23.583
Killed in the line of duty,
1965.

19:23.667 --> 19:25.375
They got his picture up
at Jones' Tavern.

19:25.458 --> 19:26.792
Now, that's great.

19:26.875 --> 19:29.458
Bad enough, cops in '65,
turned a blind eye on abusers.

19:29.542 --> 19:30.750
If that abuser was a cop..

19:30.834 --> 19:33.834
Guy had a free pass, 24/7, 365.

19:33.917 --> 19:35.417
What do you got on mom?

19:35.500 --> 19:38.458
Cynthia Mulvaney drops off
the face of the earth in
'65.

19:38.542 --> 19:40.166
A few months before
her husband's killed.

19:40.250 --> 19:42.417
We tracked down
nine other Cynthia Mulvaneys

19:42.500 --> 19:43.625
in the tri-state area.

19:43.709 --> 19:44.750
We're following up

19:44.834 --> 19:46.041
if she's still alive.

19:46.125 --> 19:47.667
Meanwhile, I got a name
and number on the lady

19:47.750 --> 19:49.709
who ran that makeshift
shelter in '65.

19:49.792 --> 19:51.375
- A Nancy Walsh.
- Still in the life.

19:51.458 --> 19:54.208
Heads up a battered women
shelter in Germantown.

19:56.291 --> 19:58.875
So in '65, you set up
an underground railroad

19:58.959 --> 20:01.083
for battered women?

20:01.166 --> 20:02.834
It was hardly a railroad.

20:02.917 --> 20:05.417
Just my living room
with a handful of cots.

20:06.709 --> 20:09.041
I took in as many families
as I could.

20:09.125 --> 20:11.000
Last stop on the line?

20:11.083 --> 20:12.417
The only stop, dear.

20:12.500 --> 20:15.458
Would you remember
a woman named Cindy Mulvaney?

20:15.542 --> 20:17.709
Uh, twin girls?

20:18.709 --> 20:21.083
This was one of 'em.

20:21.166 --> 20:22.709
Oh, yeah.

20:22.792 --> 20:25.458
Their mother wouldn't speak
one word to anybody

20:25.542 --> 20:28.041
but her daughters, the first
two weeks she was here.

20:28.125 --> 20:29.375
Why not?

20:29.458 --> 20:32.792
Her husband swore he'd find her
if she ever left him.

20:32.875 --> 20:35.583
Take everything she loved.

20:35.667 --> 20:39.000
He meant he'd kill the girls
and make her watch.

20:40.834 --> 20:42.750
What a prince.

20:42.834 --> 20:47.125
So she blamed herself,
like we all do.

20:48.583 --> 20:50.458
You just push
the button here, see?

20:50.542 --> 20:53.500
Like we did at the beach.
You make a homemade movie.

20:56.750 --> 20:58.917
Lot of laundry today, huh?

21:02.583 --> 21:06.500
Anyway, thanks for pitching in.

21:06.583 --> 21:09.667
They're just a few months old.

21:09.750 --> 21:13.417
The girls,
when he first hits you.

21:13.500 --> 21:15.834
Who, Cindy, your husband?

21:15.917 --> 21:19.875
And you tell yourself
it was just a shove, really.

21:19.959 --> 21:21.875
(Cindy)
'He didn't mean it.
He loves me.'

21:21.959 --> 21:24.709
- So you stay.
- We all stayed.

21:24.792 --> 21:28.041
Until one day, you realize
the door you could've walked
out

21:28.125 --> 21:30.542
a long time ago..

21:30.625 --> 21:34.000
...is nailed shut forever.

21:34.083 --> 21:39.875
You provided each and every
nail
every time you stayed.

21:39.959 --> 21:42.583
You had nowhere to go, no money.

21:43.792 --> 21:45.458
But you left.

21:45.542 --> 21:47.375
Remember that.

21:56.458 --> 21:57.875
I miss my wife.

21:57.959 --> 21:58.834
'Cindy..'

21:58.917 --> 22:01.291
Take the girls and go upstairs.

22:01.375 --> 22:03.917
I don't know what came over me.

22:04.000 --> 22:06.875
I swear, it will
not happen again.

22:06.959 --> 22:08.333
You always say that.

22:10.000 --> 22:14.125
Being all alone in that house
these last few weeks..

22:14.208 --> 22:17.417
...it made me realize.

22:17.500 --> 22:22.333
Without you, without my girls..

22:22.417 --> 22:25.250
...I'm nothin'.

22:25.333 --> 22:27.166
Let me go, Roger.

22:27.250 --> 22:28.959
Please.

22:29.041 --> 22:30.250
I can't.

22:32.041 --> 22:34.083
Because you're my wife.

22:34.166 --> 22:36.625
You're my happily ever after.

22:38.875 --> 22:41.000
Come home to me.

22:48.333 --> 22:50.792
(Roger)
'My shift ends at midnight.'

22:52.500 --> 22:54.125
I'll see you then.

23:02.375 --> 23:04.250
Let's pack up our things.

23:04.333 --> 23:07.125
You don't have to go
back to that jerk.

23:07.208 --> 23:10.041
You have another choice, Cindy.

23:10.125 --> 23:11.625
Remember?

23:19.041 --> 23:20.375
"Choice."

23:20.458 --> 23:21.875
What'd she mean by that?

23:21.959 --> 23:23.709
I don't know.

23:23.792 --> 23:26.291
Tiffany was her friend,
her confidante.

23:26.375 --> 23:27.834
Maybe you could ask her.

23:27.917 --> 23:29.959
Well, you know where
we can find this
Tiffany?

23:30.041 --> 23:32.542
She's one
of our most generous donors.

23:32.625 --> 23:33.750
Volunteers here.

23:33.834 --> 23:35.417
I can give
you her number.

23:35.500 --> 23:37.375
Lucky woman,
getting out.

23:37.458 --> 23:39.291
What about Cindy?

23:39.375 --> 23:41.917
- She get lucky, too?
- No.

23:42.000 --> 23:44.875
No, she packed her bags,
and went home that very night.

23:44.959 --> 23:46.375
I tried
to convince her to stay

23:46.458 --> 23:48.417
but she said
there was no use in running.

23:48.500 --> 23:50.166
He'd track her down
to the ends of the earth.

23:50.250 --> 23:52.542
Guy was a cop,
had the resources.

23:52.625 --> 23:53.959
Yeah.

23:54.041 --> 23:56.917
So you ever see Cindy again?

23:57.000 --> 24:01.041
Usually don't, after a woman
goes back to her husband.

24:01.125 --> 24:04.041
Unless I pay a visit
to the local cemetery.

24:12.834 --> 24:15.625
(Jeffries)
'You were Cindy's
friend, Tiffany.'

24:15.709 --> 24:18.000
You knew she
had other
options.

24:18.083 --> 24:20.041
When I said Cindy
had a choice

24:20.125 --> 24:22.709
I meant the man who
was madly in love with her.

24:22.792 --> 24:25.375
And I wasn't talking about
that pig of a husband.

24:25.458 --> 24:27.375
Cindy was
having an
affair?

24:27.458 --> 24:30.792
Don't make it sound tawdry,
because it wasn't.

24:30.875 --> 24:34.000
It was...sweet.

24:34.083 --> 24:36.709
Who was this guy?

24:36.792 --> 24:40.458
I don't remember his name..

24:40.542 --> 24:42.458
...but he had eyes like yours.

24:42.542 --> 24:44.125
Kind.

24:44.208 --> 24:45.667
Sexy.

24:46.750 --> 24:48.375
He was Cindy's way out.

24:48.458 --> 24:51.291
I always told myself
she took it.

24:53.959 --> 24:55.625
Firm shoulders.

24:55.709 --> 24:57.166
He had those, too.

24:57.250 --> 24:59.792
And how would
you know that?

24:59.875 --> 25:02.208
He brought us
to the beach one day.

25:02.291 --> 25:05.166
Just a few days after Cindy
first came to the shelter.

25:05.250 --> 25:08.291
Had the affair had been
going on for awhile by
then?

25:08.375 --> 25:10.250
It was just beginning.

25:10.333 --> 25:14.250
Cindy wouldn't talk
to a soul except the girls.

25:14.333 --> 25:16.750
So which beach
did he bring you
to?

25:16.834 --> 25:19.083
The dreadful
Jersey Shore.

25:20.792 --> 25:22.750
But, still..

25:22.834 --> 25:25.291
...we were able to forget
where we'd came from.

25:25.375 --> 25:28.291
That we were depending
on the kindness of strangers.

25:29.959 --> 25:31.875
That must
have been nice,
Tiffany.

25:33.542 --> 25:35.000
It was magical.

25:36.333 --> 25:38.250
If just for a day.

25:39.166 --> 25:41.250
Shot a home movie of it.

25:41.333 --> 25:44.667
You don't still have
this home movie, by any chance?

25:45.834 --> 25:48.792
It's yours for a smile, big boy.

25:53.208 --> 25:55.166
(Jeffries)
'DNA results came in
positive.'

25:55.250 --> 25:57.917
Vivian was your identical twin.

26:00.041 --> 26:03.458
Your mother's name
was Cynthia Mulvaney.

26:03.542 --> 26:06.542
(Rush)
'Your father was
a police officer.'

26:06.625 --> 26:07.834
His name was Roger.

26:07.917 --> 26:09.458
You found my parents?

26:09.542 --> 26:11.625
(Jeffries)
'We're still
looking for your mom.'

26:11.709 --> 26:15.000
Your dad was killed
on the job in 1965.

26:16.792 --> 26:18.083
Oh.

26:19.208 --> 26:20.959
Well, what was he like?

26:21.959 --> 26:24.208
We think
he was abusive.

26:24.291 --> 26:25.792
To your mother.

26:25.875 --> 26:27.834
To you girls.

26:27.917 --> 26:30.542
(Rush)
'Any memories
of that, Maura?'

26:30.625 --> 26:34.417
Like I said, there's very
little
I remember from my childhood.

26:34.500 --> 26:36.458
No wonder.

26:36.542 --> 26:40.417
We need your help identifying
this guy in this home movie.

26:40.500 --> 26:42.166
Of what?

26:42.250 --> 26:44.000
Your mother
and Vivian

26:44.083 --> 26:47.125
someone else
we can't identify and
you.

26:47.208 --> 26:49.792
Maybe he knows
what happened to your sister.

26:51.375 --> 26:52.834
Well, what're we waiting for?

27:15.959 --> 27:18.041
Oh, my god.
Is that my mom?

27:18.125 --> 27:21.458
Yeah, and Vivian.

27:23.000 --> 27:26.041
That smell in the air,
the water.

27:26.125 --> 27:29.208
It was the first time
I saw the ocean.

27:29.291 --> 27:31.333
This help you
remember anything else?

27:31.417 --> 27:33.083
(Maura)
'Yeah, that swimsuit
Vivian's wearing.'

27:33.166 --> 27:34.542
We fought over it.

27:34.625 --> 27:35.834
And she won.

27:38.041 --> 27:40.500
(Rush)
'You remember that man, Maura?'

27:40.583 --> 27:42.417
The one picking up Vivian?

27:44.542 --> 27:45.875
(Rush)
'Maura?'

27:45.959 --> 27:48.208
(Maura)
'She was so happy.'

27:48.291 --> 27:49.959
And sad at the same time.

27:50.041 --> 27:51.625
Your mom was?

27:53.125 --> 27:57.083
That day on the beach,
she called it "our perfect
day."

27:57.166 --> 27:59.792
And if you closed your eyes...

27:59.875 --> 28:00.917
'it would last forever.'

28:04.333 --> 28:06.250
Vivian's it, mommy.

28:06.333 --> 28:08.041
Play us a song, mommy.

28:08.125 --> 28:10.917
- A song?
- On the piano.

28:11.000 --> 28:13.125
(man)
'I didn't know
you played the piano.'

28:13.208 --> 28:14.959
Mommy played
all the time before.

28:15.041 --> 28:17.375
Even when she was a little girl.

28:17.458 --> 28:19.458
She stopped 'cause of daddy.

28:19.542 --> 28:20.834
'Oh.'

28:23.333 --> 28:24.917
'Won't you play
a song for me?'

28:30.667 --> 28:34.333
- Wow. It's beautiful.
- I didn't hear anything.

28:34.417 --> 28:36.291
Well, you know
what we got here?

28:36.375 --> 28:38.041
It's a "Top 40" hit.

28:38.125 --> 28:40.250
Isn't that right, mom?

28:40.333 --> 28:42.458
- Can you girls sing?
- No.

28:42.542 --> 28:44.125
- Dance?
- No.

28:44.208 --> 28:47.208
Fantastic. We're gonna
take this show on the road.

28:47.291 --> 28:50.625
You and me...
and our dancing chimpanzees.

28:54.959 --> 28:57.166
What do you say, Mom?

28:57.250 --> 28:59.291
You run away with me?

28:59.375 --> 29:01.458
Are you going to kiss mommy?

29:07.667 --> 29:08.917
(Maura)
'That was Art.'

29:09.000 --> 29:10.917
Art Balducci?

29:11.000 --> 29:12.917
The cop who came
to your house that time?

29:13.000 --> 29:14.333
Yes, that's him.

29:14.417 --> 29:16.834
He was in love with your mother?

29:16.917 --> 29:19.375
And she was in love with him.

29:19.458 --> 29:21.208
Can't you see?

29:29.291 --> 29:31.333
So why did you keep it
a secret, Art?

29:31.417 --> 29:34.083
You and Cindy?

29:34.166 --> 29:35.750
I got nothin'
to say to
youse.

29:35.834 --> 29:37.750
'Unless you knew
what happened to Vivian.'

29:37.834 --> 29:39.542
How she was killed.

29:39.625 --> 29:41.834
Or maybe you're
protecting Cindy.

29:43.166 --> 29:46.000
No way she'd lay
a finger on her own
kid.

29:46.083 --> 29:49.083
- No way.
- Somebody did.

29:50.750 --> 29:53.333
He didn't deserve her.

29:53.417 --> 29:55.667
Or those girls.

29:55.750 --> 29:58.125
You, on the other hand, were
willing to start a new life

29:58.208 --> 30:00.542
with someone you'd known
for two weeks.

30:00.625 --> 30:01.959
But how'd it begin?

30:02.041 --> 30:03.875
You and Cindy?

30:06.834 --> 30:10.917
I went to that shelter
to check in on her.

30:11.000 --> 30:14.291
I thought
it'd be that one time.

30:16.375 --> 30:19.959
But I found
myself
going every day.

30:20.041 --> 30:21.375
That's how.

30:21.458 --> 30:24.709
And a few weeks later,
the hubby tracks her down

30:24.792 --> 30:26.083
wants her back for good.

30:26.166 --> 30:27.834
You couldn't let that happen.

30:27.917 --> 30:30.834
I did my best to save her.

30:32.458 --> 30:35.375
But my best wasn't enough.

30:37.375 --> 30:40.083
He found us
at the shelter, Art.

30:40.166 --> 30:42.166
We'll never get away
from him now, never.

30:42.250 --> 30:44.083
He found you?

30:44.166 --> 30:47.083
He'll be home in an hour
and he expects us to be there.

30:47.166 --> 30:49.333
- Well, where is he now?
- On shift.

30:49.417 --> 30:51.583
Well, what are
we gonna do?

30:54.041 --> 30:56.542
Okay. We're gonna
run away. Alright?

30:56.625 --> 30:58.667
(Art)
'You, me, and the girls,
we'll go to the shore.'

30:58.750 --> 31:00.250
He's never gonna
find us there.

31:00.333 --> 31:02.875
You can't leave
your life here, Art, your job.

31:02.959 --> 31:04.125
Why not?

31:04.208 --> 31:06.417
You're young.
Your life has just started.

31:06.500 --> 31:10.458
You can't just take
on someone else's...kids.

31:10.542 --> 31:13.291
Their wife.

31:13.375 --> 31:14.834
Then be my wife.

31:16.667 --> 31:17.709
Marry me.

31:17.792 --> 31:19.667
What?

31:19.750 --> 31:21.625
I don't have much.

31:21.709 --> 31:25.208
But what I have is yours,
and the girls'.

31:25.291 --> 31:27.583
And I'll love you
and protect you

31:27.667 --> 31:30.250
and never let harm
come your way.

31:30.333 --> 31:31.959
Don't say those things
if you don't mean them.

31:32.041 --> 31:32.917
I do.

31:37.208 --> 31:39.041
So?

31:45.959 --> 31:48.250
Will you marry me?

31:48.333 --> 31:52.458
Does this mean mommy's name
is Mrs. Balducci now?

31:59.375 --> 32:00.375
Yes.

32:08.834 --> 32:10.458
What about him?

32:10.542 --> 32:13.333
What about Roger?

32:13.417 --> 32:14.917
Right.

32:15.000 --> 32:16.750
You stay here with the girls.

32:16.834 --> 32:19.000
Where are
you going,
Art?

32:19.083 --> 32:24.041
I'm gonna make sure
he never bothers you again.

32:24.125 --> 32:25.959
Keep an eye on mommy, girls.

32:26.041 --> 32:27.333
(girls)
'Okay.'

32:43.208 --> 32:46.792
Oh, heck, Balducci.
You gave me a fright.

32:48.166 --> 32:51.125
What, the whole precinct
coming down to see me home?

32:56.959 --> 32:58.875
You let her go.

32:58.959 --> 33:01.041
You let her be.

33:01.125 --> 33:03.041
You understand
my meaning?

33:04.458 --> 33:06.959
Yeah.
Yeah.

33:09.000 --> 33:10.959
You'll never hurt her again.

33:17.625 --> 33:21.000
That's how we dealt
with abusers back
then.

33:21.083 --> 33:22.834
Off the books.

33:24.291 --> 33:25.583
Okay.

33:25.667 --> 33:27.375
So then you tried
to run off with Cindy?

33:27.458 --> 33:29.583
I thought
we
were free.

33:30.875 --> 33:34.000
But I went
back
to my place..

33:34.083 --> 33:35.250
...and they were gone.

33:35.333 --> 33:37.875
Cindy, the girls.

33:37.959 --> 33:39.875
There was a note.

33:39.959 --> 33:43.083
"We forgot
Snowflake.
Be back soon."

33:43.166 --> 33:44.959
They went back for the cat.

33:45.041 --> 33:46.917
To the house.

33:47.000 --> 33:52.500
I raced over, but
it was dark,
empty.

33:52.583 --> 33:55.500
I drove around for
hours
that night lookin' for
'em.

33:55.583 --> 33:57.333
Went down to the shore.

33:57.417 --> 33:59.834
I walked that beach till dawn.

34:01.041 --> 34:03.250
Never found 'em.

34:03.333 --> 34:06.583
I kept hopin' she'd call.

34:06.667 --> 34:09.375
But she never did.

34:09.458 --> 34:11.583
And that's when I knew.

34:11.667 --> 34:14.625
Roger had found her, the girls.

34:14.709 --> 34:17.166
He never
said a
word..

34:18.750 --> 34:20.333
..but I knew.

34:22.041 --> 34:26.250
Roger was killed in the line
of duty a few months later.

34:26.333 --> 34:28.083
You knew his beat.

34:29.917 --> 34:34.041
She was Mrs. Cindy
Balducci
for a day.

34:35.667 --> 34:38.208
(Art)
At least I had that.

34:38.291 --> 34:41.583
Cindy Balducci.

34:41.667 --> 34:45.125
No need to write any
of that last part down.

34:46.500 --> 34:48.792
Don't remember
what the man said anyhow.

34:52.583 --> 34:56.291
If you ever find Cindy
out there somewhere..

34:58.125 --> 35:00.166
...would you tell her..

35:00.250 --> 35:02.834
...she doesn't need
to be afraid of him
anymore.

35:04.250 --> 35:06.834
Art took care of it.

35:27.792 --> 35:29.959
- Hmm?
- Cindy Balducci?

35:31.959 --> 35:33.500
Yes. May I help you?

35:33.583 --> 35:35.375
Philadelphia PD.

35:35.458 --> 35:38.291
Or, uh, is
it
Mulvaney?

35:40.834 --> 35:42.208
That's all for today.

35:42.291 --> 35:45.250
I'll see you next week.

35:49.625 --> 35:52.458
Please go away.

35:52.542 --> 35:56.166
Maura wants
to know why you left.

35:56.250 --> 35:57.875
I don't know
anyone
by that name.

35:57.959 --> 35:59.709
I'm sorry.

36:09.667 --> 36:12.000
She can't know.

36:12.083 --> 36:15.959
- He'll find her.
- Your husband?

36:16.041 --> 36:18.250
He's dead, Cindy.

36:18.333 --> 36:21.583
He can't hurt Maura,
not anymore.

36:26.333 --> 36:28.750
He swore he'd find me.

36:28.834 --> 36:31.000
He'd find her.

36:31.083 --> 36:33.625
He would take
everything I
loved.

36:35.500 --> 36:38.375
Like he took Vivian.

36:38.458 --> 36:40.500
What did he do to Vivian?

36:40.583 --> 36:42.959
Don't you see?

36:43.041 --> 36:45.125
I still had Maura left.

36:46.792 --> 36:49.709
I had to make sure
she would be safe from
him.

36:52.041 --> 36:55.166
That's why I left
her
at the church.

36:57.375 --> 37:00.000
And she was safe.

37:00.083 --> 37:04.083
But now Maura needs to know
why she ended up alone.

37:08.667 --> 37:10.542
Tell her.

37:13.542 --> 37:16.083
I had no choice.

37:16.166 --> 37:19.041
I had to make sure
he'd never find
you.

37:20.250 --> 37:23.583
Even if that meant
giving you up
forever.

37:26.000 --> 37:27.792
Snowflake, where are you?

37:27.875 --> 37:29.250
Shh.
Keep your voice down.

37:29.333 --> 37:31.291
But daddy's still
at work, mommy.

37:31.375 --> 37:33.250
I know, but we have
to be quiet, okay?

37:33.333 --> 37:36.750
I'll get Snowflake, but you
have
to promise to stay put, okay?

37:36.834 --> 37:38.083
[girls in unison]
Okay.

37:47.625 --> 37:49.250
Snowflake?

37:49.333 --> 37:51.834
Snowflake. Snowflake.

37:54.417 --> 37:57.583
Stupid cat. Come here.

38:03.417 --> 38:04.917
Oh, thank God.

38:05.000 --> 38:07.542
Let's get out of here.

38:09.709 --> 38:13.333
You wanna drive,
or should I?

38:13.417 --> 38:14.625
'Get in.'

38:24.792 --> 38:27.709
(Roger)
We're a family.

38:27.792 --> 38:30.417
We're gonna work this out.

38:30.500 --> 38:32.917
Families always do.

38:33.000 --> 38:34.542
Isn't that right, girls?

38:39.125 --> 38:40.959
First, I gotta know something.

38:41.041 --> 38:43.417
Where are you taking us?

38:43.500 --> 38:44.834
Did you make it with him?

38:44.917 --> 38:45.959
Roger, not in
front
of the girls.

38:46.041 --> 38:48.583
Did you make it with him?

38:48.667 --> 38:51.083
No, I didn't.

38:52.041 --> 38:53.458
(Roger)
'Good.'

38:56.375 --> 38:57.834
That's good.

39:01.166 --> 39:04.125
That means we can start again.

39:04.208 --> 39:05.625
You and me.

39:05.709 --> 39:06.583
Roger..

39:06.667 --> 39:08.542
I'd kill myself if we couldn't.

39:10.625 --> 39:14.375
You're the only thing
in my life that counts.

39:14.458 --> 39:16.750
I'm nothing without my family.

39:21.208 --> 39:23.125
I miss my wife.

39:26.208 --> 39:27.750
I miss you, too.

39:29.500 --> 39:31.375
(Roger)
'Do you miss daddy, girls?'

39:31.458 --> 39:33.125
Yes, daddy.

39:33.208 --> 39:34.750
Should we go home then?

39:34.834 --> 39:38.291
What about Mrs. Balducci, mommy?

39:38.375 --> 39:40.917
We don't need to talk about her.

39:41.000 --> 39:43.458
Who's Mrs. Balducci?

39:43.542 --> 39:45.333
Mommy is.

39:52.709 --> 39:54.875
I'm sorry.

39:54.959 --> 39:57.208
Me, too.

40:12.500 --> 40:13.834
(Cindy)
'What are you doing, Roger?'

40:13.917 --> 40:15.333
'What are you doing'?

40:16.750 --> 40:17.875
Roger?

40:21.083 --> 40:24.000
What are you doing with them?

40:24.083 --> 40:26.375
Roger?

40:26.458 --> 40:28.041
Give them back to me.

40:30.125 --> 40:31.625
I'll do
anything you
want.

40:31.709 --> 40:34.083
- Just give them back to me.
- Mommy.

40:34.166 --> 40:37.417
Think you can just drive off
into the sunset?

40:37.500 --> 40:39.000
Live happily ever after?

40:39.083 --> 40:40.625
No. No, I don't.

40:45.458 --> 40:46.500
No. No.

40:46.583 --> 40:48.417
There is no happily ever after.

40:48.500 --> 40:49.375
'No!'

40:49.458 --> 40:51.083
Not for us, babe.

40:51.166 --> 40:52.667
Not for you.

40:52.750 --> 40:53.917
Not if I can help it.

40:54.000 --> 40:55.875
(girls)
Mommy, mommy!

40:55.959 --> 40:57.500
No-o-o!

41:00.000 --> 41:01.000
No. No.

41:01.083 --> 41:03.166
No-o-o!
