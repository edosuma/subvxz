WEBVTT

00:01.032 --> 00:03.034
ALL RIGHT, A COUPLE OF BEERS

00:03.034 --> 00:06.437
AND A WHITE WINE WITH
HALF AN ICE CUBE FOR PRINCESS.

00:06.437 --> 00:09.180
JULES, I AM LIKING
THE NEW BOYFRIEND.

00:09.180 --> 00:12.413
YOU EVER NOTICE HOW YOU CAN
TELL HOW A GUY IS IN BED

00:12.413 --> 00:15.186
JUST BY LOOKING AT HIM?
OH, FOR SURE.

00:15.186 --> 00:17.218
THAT GUY SCREAMS OUT
HIS OWN NAME.
(laughs)

00:17.218 --> 00:20.051
(laughs)

00:20.051 --> 00:23.724
THAT GUY DOESN'T MAKE LOVE.
HE MAKES LOVE.
OOH.

00:23.724 --> 00:26.697
HEY, DUDE. SLOW DOWN.

00:26.697 --> 00:30.131
WE ACTUALLY LIKE IT LONGER
THAN FIVE SECONDS.

00:30.131 --> 00:33.104
в™Єв™Є

00:33.104 --> 00:35.506
(mouth full)
THIS IS A STUPID GAME.

00:35.506 --> 00:37.508
THAT GUY OVER THERE IS
CLUMSY IN BED,

00:37.508 --> 00:40.511
BUT HE TRIES REALLY HARD,
AND HE'S VERY WELL-ENDOWED.
WHOA. WHO'S THAT?

00:40.511 --> 00:43.043
HEY, GANG.
HEY.

00:43.043 --> 00:44.745
CONGRATULATIONS.
THANK YOU.

00:44.745 --> 00:46.117
FOR WHAT?

00:46.117 --> 00:48.719
SEE, THAT'S WHY DATING
IS EASIER FOR WOMEN.

00:48.719 --> 00:52.723
YOU GUYS KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE GETTING.
IT IS HARD TO BE
A SINGLE MAN OUT THERE.

00:52.723 --> 00:55.186
NO, IT IS SO MUCH HARDER
TO BE A SINGLE WOMAN.

00:55.186 --> 00:57.688
SO MUCH HARDER.
DO YOU GUYS READ "CATHY"?

00:57.688 --> 01:00.331
LOOK, WHEN IT COMES TO SEX,
WOMEN ARE THE GATEKEEPERS.

01:00.331 --> 01:02.333
THAT'S WHY IT'S EASIER
FOR YOU.

01:02.333 --> 01:05.196
YOU GET TO DECIDE WHEN
AND IF IT'S HAPPENING.

01:05.196 --> 01:08.068
AND IN FACT, IF YOU WERE
TO CALL A TOTAL STRANGER,

01:08.068 --> 01:10.641
ASK HIM TO HAVE SEX,
HE WILL SAY YES.

01:10.641 --> 01:12.443
PLEASE.
NO, HE WOULDN'T.

01:12.443 --> 01:16.307
I WOULD.
I'M GONNA DO IT.
OKAY, HERE WE GO.

01:16.307 --> 01:19.110
AND SPEAKERPHONE.
(phone rings)

01:19.110 --> 01:22.113
LOSER PICKS UP THE TAB.
I-I LIKE THAT.

01:22.113 --> 01:23.754
(ring)

01:23.754 --> 01:25.256
(man) Hello?
OH!

01:25.256 --> 01:27.558
OH, GOD. UM, HI.

01:27.558 --> 01:31.192
Hi.
UM, WILL YOU
HAVE SEX WITH ME?

01:31.192 --> 01:33.594
в™Єв™Є

01:33.594 --> 01:35.266
(whispers) NO.
(mouths word)

01:35.266 --> 01:37.128
Uh, sure.
OHH!

01:37.128 --> 01:38.429
(laughter)

01:38.429 --> 01:41.101
WHOO! YES.
(beep)

01:41.101 --> 01:44.104
OKAY, WHAT IS YOUR DEAL, MAN?
(laughs)

01:44.104 --> 01:46.407
NO, I THINK
YOU NEED TO LOOK DEEPER.

01:46.407 --> 01:49.280
HONEY, YOU DESERVE MORE
THAN THAT.

01:49.280 --> 01:52.883
OH. SHORTS AND A-A LITTLE BLUE
BUTTON-DOWN. WHY?
OKAY.

01:52.883 --> 01:56.317
IT'S REALLY STRANGE THAT YOU'RE
STILL TALKING TO THAT GUY.

01:56.317 --> 01:58.319
TOM, I GOTTA CALL YOU BACK.

01:58.319 --> 02:01.192
OKAY. HEY, GOOD LUCK
ON YOUR INTERVIEW. BYE.
(beep)

02:01.192 --> 02:03.894
SO LOOK, THERE'S NOTHING GOOD
ON TV TONIGHT.

02:03.894 --> 02:06.897
I THOUGHT IT'D BE FUN
TO PLAY A LITTLE SCRABBLE.
OH, SCRABBLE.

02:06.897 --> 02:08.399
MM-HMM.
OKAY.

02:08.399 --> 02:10.601
UM, OR WE COULD...

02:10.601 --> 02:12.763
SPELL THIS.

02:12.763 --> 02:16.136
YOU SEXED UP JEFF BECAUSE YOU
DIDN'T WANT TO PLAY SCRABBLE?

02:16.136 --> 02:19.170
YOU LOVE SCRABBLE.
YEAH, BUT JEFF--HE'S, LIKE,
"GOOD WILL HUNTING" SMART.

02:19.170 --> 02:22.173
IF MATT DAMON WEREN'T MARRIED
AND IF HE WEREN'T A MOVIE STAR

02:22.173 --> 02:25.476
AND IF HE LIVED IN THIS TOWN,
I REALLY THINK WE WOULD DATE.

02:25.476 --> 02:27.848
THAT'S A LOT OF "IFs."
YET NOT ENOUGH.

02:27.848 --> 02:31.222
I'M JUST NOT READY FOR JEFF
TO KNOW HOW DUMB I AM.
(footsteps descending stairs)

02:31.222 --> 02:33.224
I MEAN, NOT YET.
OH, YEAH, NO.

02:33.224 --> 02:35.226
YOU KNOW WHY I DIG
MY GIRLFRIEND?

02:35.226 --> 02:37.188
IT'S BECAUSE FROM DAY ONE,

02:37.188 --> 02:40.191
SHE'S BEEN COMPLETELY HONEST
WITH ME ABOUT WHO SHE IS.
(all laugh)

02:40.191 --> 02:42.493
(laughs) TRAVIS,
LET ME TEACH YOU

02:42.493 --> 02:44.495
A LITTLE SOMETHING
ABOUT WOMEN.

02:44.495 --> 02:47.198
WHEN A GIRL STARTS TO DATE
A GUY, I MEAN,

02:47.198 --> 02:50.201
AT FIRST, SHE LIKES TO LET HIM
THINK THAT SHE'S A CERTAIN WAY

02:50.201 --> 02:53.244
OR THAT SHE LIKES CERTAIN
THINGS, LIKE SUPERHERO MOVIES

02:53.244 --> 02:55.446
OR, UH, MORNING SEX.
EW.

02:55.446 --> 02:58.549
(Laurie) BLEH. (coughs)
BUT THEN YOU GET MARRIED
AND THE MASK COMES OFF

02:58.549 --> 03:01.552
AND YOU FIND OUT WHAT YOUR WIFE
IS REALLY LIKE.
TA-DA!

03:01.552 --> 03:03.954
THERE'S SOMETHING VERY SWEET
AND SOFT ABOUT YOU, MRS. TORRES.
THANK YOU.

03:03.954 --> 03:06.257
ELLIE AND I HAVE TO GO
TO THE DERMATOLOGIST.

03:06.257 --> 03:09.590
LAURIE, YOU HAVE TO MEET
WITH OUR BANKER.
(whispers) NO.

03:09.590 --> 03:11.462
YES, AND I WANT YOU TO WEAR
THAT SUIT THAT I PICKED OUT.

03:11.462 --> 03:14.665
BUT THIS TIME,
PLEASE PUT A SHIRT UNDER IT.
SHA!

03:14.665 --> 03:17.928
ALL RIGHT. WE'RE OFF TO
THE MEANEST DOCTOR IN THE WORLD.
UGH. SHE IS THE WORST.

03:17.928 --> 03:22.833
IF SHE'S THE WORST,
WHY GO TO HER?
BECAUSE SHE'S THE BEST. DER.

03:22.833 --> 03:27.478
DO YOU THINK EVERY SINGLE PERSON
IS HERE FOR BOTOX?

03:27.478 --> 03:29.480
WELCOME TO THE TIME MACHINE,
LADIES.

03:29.480 --> 03:34.214
WHICH OF THE MANY FINE DOCTORS
HERE ARE YOU SEEING?
UH, DR. EVANS. YOU?

03:34.214 --> 03:35.546
THE OTHER 12.

03:35.546 --> 03:38.819
SEE YOU IN TWO DAYS,
WHEN I EMERGE FROM MY CHRYSALIS.

03:38.819 --> 03:41.252
(door opens)
UGH. DR. EVANS IS SO SCARY.

03:41.252 --> 03:44.895
WHAT IS YOUR STRATEGY
TO DEAL WITH HER?
OH, I'M TOTALLY SUBMISSIVE.
I AVOID EYE CONTACT,

03:44.895 --> 03:47.998
I KEEP MY HEAD DOWN AND MUMBLE
SOFTLY AT ANY DIRECT QUESTIONS.

03:47.998 --> 03:49.630
I'M GONNA GO
WITH STRAIGHT-UP NICE.

03:49.630 --> 03:51.932
FIRST I'M GONNA HIT HER
WITH A "GREAT HAIR,"

03:51.932 --> 03:55.706
THEN I'LL KNOCK HER BACK
WITH A "YOU SMELL NICE"

03:55.706 --> 03:58.709
AND FINALLY,
"YOU GOT A SEXY, SMOKY VOICE."

03:58.709 --> 04:01.712
KA-BAM!
I'VE KILLED HER WITH KINDNESS.

04:01.712 --> 04:04.515
OH, YOU GOT YOUR GUNS WITH YA.
OH, YEAH, I BROUGHT 'EM. MM.

04:04.515 --> 04:06.517
YOU KNOW WHY I LOVE YOUR WAY?
WHY?

04:06.517 --> 04:09.820
IT'S SO WHO YOU ARE.
HELL, I'M A STRONG PERSON.
(door opens)

04:09.820 --> 04:12.983
I'M GONNA BE STRONG, TOO.
"ELLIE TORRES."
WHERE IS ELLIE TORRES?

04:12.983 --> 04:15.826
(lowered voice) UM,
I'M RIGHT HERE, DR. EVANS.

04:15.826 --> 04:18.959
DID YOU JUST SAY SOMETHING?
NO, I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING.
SORRY.

04:18.959 --> 04:22.763
ALL RIGHT, GO TO MY OFFICE.
YOU'VE GOT
A SMOKY, SEXY VOICE!

04:22.763 --> 04:25.736
OKAY, YOU NEED TO TAKE
YOUR PERKY DIAL

04:25.736 --> 04:27.868
AND TURN IT DOWN
A FEW THOUSAND NOTCHES.

04:27.868 --> 04:30.901
OKAY, NORMALLY I WOULD KICK YOU
OUT OF MY OFFICE,

04:30.901 --> 04:33.944
BUT YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF THINGS
GOING ON HERE,

04:33.944 --> 04:36.907
WHICH IS GOOD, 'CAUSE MAMA
NEEDS A NEW STEAM SHOWER.

04:36.907 --> 04:40.280
ANY QUESTIONS?
(lowered voice) I'M JUST
GONNA WAIT RIGHT HERE.

04:40.280 --> 04:41.982
YOU SMELL NICE.
THAT'S THE SMELL OF CONFIDENCE.

04:41.982 --> 04:44.014
(imitates gunshot)

04:44.014 --> 04:45.986
(sighs)
(door closes)

04:45.986 --> 04:49.390
WOW. I'VE NEVER SEEN YOU
WEAR SO FEW COLORS AT ONCE.

04:49.390 --> 04:51.892
I FEEL LIKE THAT LADY
THAT COMES TO YOUR HOUSE

04:51.892 --> 04:53.894
EVERY SIX MONTHS
WHEN YOU'RE A KID

04:53.894 --> 04:56.467
AND DECIDES WHETHER OR NOT
YOU GET TO KEEP LIVING THERE.

04:56.467 --> 04:58.669
UGH. CAN I GET A BEER?
OOH. GET ME ONE, TOO.

04:58.669 --> 05:01.732
WHOA! AND YOU IN A SUIT.
WHAT IS GOING ON?

05:01.732 --> 05:04.074
BLACK IS WHITE. YIN IS YANG.

05:04.074 --> 05:06.677
HOT IS COLD. DeVITO'S TALL.
JON IS KATE.

05:06.677 --> 05:10.010
SERIOUSLY, IF YOU PAY FOR THIS,
I THINK MY HEART WILL STOP.

05:10.010 --> 05:12.913
YOU'RE SAFE. MY NEW GIRLFRIEND
BOUGHT THIS FOR ME.

05:12.913 --> 05:15.516
SWEET DEAL--SHE BUYS ME THINGS,
AND IN RETURN,

05:15.516 --> 05:18.519
WHEN WE'RE IN THE SACK,
I TRY TO HANG IN THERE

05:18.519 --> 05:22.893
FOR LONGER THAN FIVE MINUTES.
MM. I HAVE TO GO. I HAVE
A STUPID MEETING AT THE BANK.

05:22.893 --> 05:25.626
WELL, AREN'T, UH, ALL MEETINGS
AT BANKS A LITTLE STUPID?

05:25.626 --> 05:28.459
(laughs)
(laughs)

05:28.459 --> 05:31.061
WHY IS THAT FUNNY?

05:31.061 --> 05:34.064
YOU OKAY?
IT'S BEEN A WHILE
SINCE I WORE I TIE.

05:34.064 --> 05:37.968
I KEEP THINKING SOMEONE'S
TRYING TO STRANGLE ME.
SO I WAS THINKING ABOUT
GETTING SOME BOTOX,

05:37.968 --> 05:40.511
BUT, UH, I WANT TO KEEP
A NATURAL LOOK.

05:40.511 --> 05:43.043
WHAT--WHAT WOULD YOU DO?
OH, I WOULDN'T DO ANYTHING.

05:43.043 --> 05:46.046
BUT OBVIOUSLY, I DON'T GET
WORK DONE ON MY FACE.

05:46.046 --> 05:48.048
I'M NOT JUDGING.
IT'S JUST--I GUESS

05:48.048 --> 05:51.021
I JUST FEEL SECURE ENOUGH
AS A WOMAN THAT I DON'T NEED

05:51.021 --> 05:54.525
TO INJECT POISON INTO MY HEAD.
BUT THAT'S JUST ME.

05:54.525 --> 05:58.589
WELL, IT'S NICE NOT TO JUDGE.
OKAY. I'LL LOOK OVER HERE.

05:58.589 --> 06:00.591
YOU HAVE A LOT OF DEGREES.

06:00.591 --> 06:02.933
I'M A DOCTOR.
THAT'S HOW IT WORKS.

06:02.933 --> 06:05.936
WHERE'D YOU GO TO SCHOOL?
WELL, I STARTED AT U.F.,

06:05.936 --> 06:09.039
AND THEN I TOOK A LITTLE BREAK
TO HAVE A BABY.
WHEN DID YOU GET YOUR DEGREE?

06:09.039 --> 06:11.572
I'M CURRENTLY STILL ON BREAK.

06:11.572 --> 06:14.575
BUT I STARTED MY OWN BUSINESS.
I'M IN REAL ESTATE.

06:14.575 --> 06:17.578
OH, I GOT MY REAL ESTATE LICENSE
ONLINE ONE MORNING

06:17.578 --> 06:20.581
WHEN I WAS TRYING TO AVOID FEES
FOR MY SECOND HOME.

06:20.581 --> 06:23.584
YEAH. BUT I GET IT. I GET IT.
REAL ESTATE'S WHAT YOU DO

06:23.584 --> 06:25.916
WHEN YOU HAVE NO OTHER OPTIONS,
YOU KNOW?

06:25.916 --> 06:27.918
I GUESS IT'S LIKE
BEING A STRIPPER,

06:27.918 --> 06:30.591
EXCEPT YOU GET TO SEE YOUR FACE
ON A BUS BENCH.

06:30.591 --> 06:33.594
WELL, NOT THIS FACE, OF COURSE,
BUT THE AIRBRUSHED VERSION.

06:33.594 --> 06:36.126
WHEN YOU STRING THAT MANY
MEAN THOUGHTS TOGETHER,

06:36.126 --> 06:38.128
I LOSE MY BREATH
JUST A LITTLE BIT.

06:38.128 --> 06:40.771
WELL, THIS IS GOING TO BURN
LIKE A MOTHER.

06:40.771 --> 06:43.033
IT WAS, UH, IT WAS NICE
MEETING YOU.

06:43.033 --> 06:45.876
MY NAME'S SMITH.
LAURIE. LAURIE.

06:45.876 --> 06:47.578
(gags and laughs)
(laughs)

06:47.578 --> 06:49.840
I MEAN, I THOUGHT HE WAS CUTE,

06:49.840 --> 06:53.183
BUT WHAT KIND OF A TOOL
GOES BY HIS LAST NAME?
RIGHT?

06:53.183 --> 06:55.886
SMITH IS HIS FIRST NAME.
(gasps)

06:55.886 --> 06:58.619
THAT'S A FIRST NAME-LAST NAME
SITUATION. I LOVE THOSE.

06:58.619 --> 07:01.151
SMITH'S FAMILY OWNS THAT GIANT
HOUSE OVER ON ROSE STREET,

07:01.151 --> 07:03.994
YOU KNOW, THE ONE
THAT LOOKS LIKE A HOTEL?
WAIT. THAT HOTEL?

07:03.994 --> 07:07.798
IT'S ACTUALLY A HOUSE.
THE ONE THAT'S NEXT
TO THE HOTEL?

07:07.798 --> 07:11.502
WE ARE NOT GETTING ANYWHERE
HERE. LOOK, DUDE IS LOADED.

07:11.502 --> 07:13.934
MESSAGE RECEIVED, MY FRIEND.

07:13.934 --> 07:16.036
SMITH!
HA.

07:16.036 --> 07:18.108
HEY, LITTLE MAN.

07:18.108 --> 07:21.742
I HEARD ELLIE AND THE GANG
DROPPED SOME KNOWLEDGE ON YA.

07:21.742 --> 07:24.444
APPARENTLY ALL WOMEN
ARE LIARS.

07:24.444 --> 07:26.116
DOES THIS MEAN MY GIRLFRIEND

07:26.116 --> 07:29.850
DOESN'T REALLY LOVE
MY SHORT STORIES?
OF COURSE NOT, TRAV.
NOBODY DOES.

07:29.850 --> 07:31.882
DO YOU REALLY WANNA
UNDERSTAND WOMEN?

07:31.882 --> 07:34.685
I FEEL LIKE THIS IS HEADING
TO A BAD PLACE.

07:34.685 --> 07:37.528
I'M GONNA TEACH YOU
ABOUT WOMEN.
(singsong voice) THERE IT IS.

07:37.528 --> 07:41.131
LOOK AT ME. I'M A SCHLUBBY GUY
YET I GOT A HOT WIFE.

07:41.131 --> 07:42.633
I MADE THAT HAPPEN.

07:42.633 --> 07:45.636
SEE THE GUY OVER THERE?
HE'S BETTER-LOOKING THAN ME,

07:45.636 --> 07:48.539
BUT HIS WIFE IS
NOT AS HOT AS MINE.

07:48.539 --> 07:51.171
IF WE WERE TO MAKE EYE CONTACT,
HE'D KNOW WHO WON.
HEY, GUYS.

07:51.171 --> 07:52.873
HEY, BABE.

07:52.873 --> 07:55.045
(chuckles)

07:57.608 --> 07:59.510
AH, THAT'S RIGHT, BITCH.

07:59.510 --> 08:02.713
THIS IS THE LAST TIME
I BRING YOUR MAIL OVER.

08:02.713 --> 08:04.755
(groans) BILL, BILL.

08:04.755 --> 08:06.957
HEY, YOU LOOK A LITTLE, UH...

08:06.957 --> 08:08.819
YOUNGER? PRETTIER?

08:08.819 --> 08:13.193
ALL RIGHT.
WELL, I BETTER. I HAD THE WORST
MORNING WITH THIS EVIL DOCTOR.

08:13.193 --> 08:15.826
SHE WAS, LIKE,
QUEEN BITCH OF THE UNIVERSE.

08:18.098 --> 08:19.800
OH, COME ON!

08:19.800 --> 08:23.073
I LIKE "QUEEN BITCH." MAKES ME
SOUND LIKE LEADER OF THE GAYS.

08:24.705 --> 08:29.640
в™Єв™Є

08:35.816 --> 08:38.749
WELL, THIS IS A SURPRISE,
OF SOME SORT.

08:38.749 --> 08:40.751
OH, I MET ROBERT
AT THE GOLF COURSE.

08:40.751 --> 08:43.223
I LOST MY PUTTER,
AND HE FOUND IT.
(laughs) SHE GOT PISSED OFF

08:43.223 --> 08:45.926
AND THREW IT IN THAT NASTY POND
ON THE THIRD HOLE.

08:45.926 --> 08:48.629
I DOVE IN AND GOT IT.

08:48.629 --> 08:53.103
IN RETURN, AMY TREATED
MY BITE FROM AN ANGRY GOOSE.
YOU SEE, UM, GOOSE SALIVA IS
FULL OF BACTERIA.

08:53.103 --> 08:54.865
YES, I KNOW THAT, DR. EVANS.

08:54.865 --> 08:57.067
I MAY NOT HAVE
YOUR FANCY DEGREES,

08:57.067 --> 08:59.039
BUT I KNOW ABOUT
A LOT OF THINGS.

08:59.039 --> 09:02.072
I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT GOOSE SPIT
WAS SUCH A TOUCHY AREA.

09:02.072 --> 09:04.174
NOW YOU KNOW.
CALM DOWN, J-BIRD.

09:04.174 --> 09:06.877
AFTER ALL, YOU'RE THE ONE
THAT BUSTED IN ON US.

09:06.877 --> 09:10.120
YOU KNOW,
IF THE BOAT'S A-ROCKIN'--
PLEASE DON'T FINISH.

09:10.120 --> 09:13.183
BUT IT'S FUN TO FINISH.
YOU'LL LIVE.

09:13.183 --> 09:14.554
YOU KNOW, YOU CERTAINLY HAVE
A LOT TO SAY.

09:14.554 --> 09:17.027
WHAT IS YOUR RELATIONSHIP?
I'M HIS EX-WIFE.

09:17.027 --> 09:19.029
I'M SORRY. I WASN'T LISTENING.

09:19.029 --> 09:21.031
I-I THINK I MISSED
A FEW DEEP FROWN LINES.

09:21.031 --> 09:24.294
WELL, I'LL COME BY ON MONDAY.
I'M CLOSED MONDAY.

09:24.294 --> 09:27.137
DON'T COME A-KNOCKIN'.

09:27.137 --> 09:28.799
SORRY.

09:28.799 --> 09:31.241
SO YOU UP
FOR GOING OUT TONIGHT?

09:31.241 --> 09:34.174
SURE, SMITH. OOH. I SWEAR,
IF I EVER HAVE A WHITE BABY,

09:34.174 --> 09:36.176
I AM TOTALLY NAMING HIM SMITH.

09:36.176 --> 09:37.908
THANKS... I GUESS.

09:37.908 --> 09:41.181
SO I WAS THINKING WE COULD GO
TO THIS POLITICAL FUND-RAISER

09:41.181 --> 09:44.615
THAT MY FAMILY'S THROWING.
YAY! I LOVE THOSE.

09:44.615 --> 09:47.818
I CAN'T GO TO SOME POLITICAL
THING AT A COUNTRY CLUB.

09:47.818 --> 09:49.820
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO ACT.

09:49.820 --> 09:51.822
AW, IT'S JUST LIKE
"PRETTY WOMAN."

09:51.822 --> 09:53.824
ACTUALLY, IT'S MORE LIKE
"MYSTIC PIZZA,"

09:53.824 --> 09:56.196
BUT EITHER WAY, I GET TO BE
JULIA ROBERTS, SO BITE ME.

09:56.196 --> 09:58.999
WELL, THEN LET'S SEE
THAT LITTLE JULIA TOOTHY SMILE.

09:58.999 --> 10:01.832
(imitates Julia Roberts
laughing)

10:01.832 --> 10:04.204
I'M GONNA TEACH YOU
ABOUT WOMANHOOD,

10:04.204 --> 10:07.708
BUT I WANT YOU
TO THINK FROM HERE,

10:07.708 --> 10:10.310
NOT HERE AND NEVER EVER...

10:10.310 --> 10:11.882
HERE.

10:11.882 --> 10:13.714
PLEASE STOP DOING THAT.

10:13.714 --> 10:16.086
NOW, ELLIE'S SKIN DOCTOR
MADE HER FEEL OLD,

10:16.086 --> 10:19.089
AND WHEN A WOMAN'S
IN A VULNERABLE PLACE,

10:19.089 --> 10:20.390
THEY'RE LIKE A...

10:20.390 --> 10:23.093
A CORNERED BADGER
READY TO LASH OUT.

10:23.093 --> 10:25.856
OBSERVE.

10:25.856 --> 10:29.129
ANDY, THIS IS WHERE WE EAT.

10:29.129 --> 10:32.863
YOU MAY BE THE DUMBEST PERSON
I'VE EVER MET UP CLOSE.

10:32.863 --> 10:35.866
SORRY, BABE.
SHE JUST CRUSHED YOU.

10:35.866 --> 10:37.267
YEAH. BUT SHE OVERREACTED.

10:37.267 --> 10:40.640
LATER SHE'LL FEEL GUILTY,
AND THAT'S GONNA WORK FOR ME.

10:40.640 --> 10:43.874
OH, AND WHAT IS THIS?
HER FAVORITE NECKLACE.

10:43.874 --> 10:47.317
NOW WHAT DO YOU THINK
I SHOULD DO WITH THIS?

10:47.317 --> 10:50.380
GIVE IT BACK TO HER?

10:50.380 --> 10:53.083
NO, WE'RE GONNA PUT THAT
IN THIS PENCIL BOX.

10:53.083 --> 10:55.155
THAT'S GONNA COME BACK LATER.
ALL RIGHT, COME ON.

10:55.155 --> 10:58.729
WE GOT A BIG DAY.
BIG, BIG, BIG DAY.
SHE THINKS SHE IS
SO MUCH BETTER THAN ME,

10:58.729 --> 11:01.732
SO YOU KNOW SHE'S GIVING BOBBY
THE SAME SUPERIOR ATTITUDE.

11:01.732 --> 11:03.363
WHY DO YOU EVEN CARE?

11:03.363 --> 11:06.666
I FEEL BAD. BOBBY IS JUST
SUCH A KIND, BEAUTIFUL MAN.

11:06.666 --> 11:10.000
IF YOU WANT TO HAVE SEX WITH
HIM, I CAN DRIVE YOU OVER THERE.
NO, I'M GOOD FOR NOW.

11:10.000 --> 11:12.072
NICE EDGE, JEFFIE.
YOU LIKE THAT?

11:12.072 --> 11:14.204
OH, I DO.
I BET YOU DO.

11:14.204 --> 11:17.808
YOU KNOW I DO.
ALL RIGHT, YOUR BANTER'S
STARTING TO SOUND

11:17.808 --> 11:21.051
A LITTLE SEXUAL.
YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO KEEPS FANTASIZING

11:21.051 --> 11:23.914
ABOUT YOUR EX-HUSBAND.
OOH. HE'S THE JEALOUS TYPE.
HOW FUN IS THAT?

11:23.914 --> 11:26.056
SO FUN.
HERE'S A CRAZY NOTION--

11:26.056 --> 11:28.358
WHY NOT JUST LET THE GUY
LIVE HIS OWN LIFE?
MAYBE.

11:28.358 --> 11:30.721
WE NEED TO TALK.

11:30.721 --> 11:32.222
OH, HAPPY DAY.

11:32.222 --> 11:35.796
SO THOSE ARE
THE MAIN DIFFERENCES

11:35.796 --> 11:39.099
BETWEEN DEMOCRATS
AND REPUBLICANS.
I JUST WISH
YOU COULD MAKE IT SIMPLER.

11:39.099 --> 11:42.372
UH, DONKEY LIKES HYBRIDS,
HEALTH CARE AND HOMOSEXUALS

11:42.372 --> 11:44.204
AND ELEPHANT LIKES GOD.

11:44.204 --> 11:47.237
I SAW AN ELEPHANT PRAY
AT A CIRCUS ONCE.

11:47.237 --> 11:49.810
WOW. THAT'S... RELEVANT.

11:49.810 --> 11:52.913
SO BOTH OF OUR VOTES
COUNT THE SAME, RIGHT?

11:52.913 --> 11:56.216
YEAH. IT'S A, UH,
IT'S A GREAT SYSTEM.
I THINK IT WORKS.

11:56.216 --> 11:59.389
YOU WANT TO KNOW
WHY I'M WITH BOBBY?
YES.

11:59.389 --> 12:02.222
HE MAKES ME FEEL LIKE
A KID AGAIN.

12:02.222 --> 12:05.395
I'VE NEVER BEEN WITH A MAN
WHO COULD DO THAT.
REALLY?

12:05.395 --> 12:08.398
NO. HE HAS NICE HAIR
AND HE'S GOOD IN THE SACK.

12:08.398 --> 12:10.460
HE IS GREAT IN THE SACK.
HE'S NOT.

12:10.460 --> 12:13.063
BUT HE TRIES REALLY HARD.
HE DOESN'T.

12:13.063 --> 12:16.306
I KNOW.
WHAT IS THE DEAL WITH THAT?

12:16.306 --> 12:19.139
SERIOUSLY, DUDE, STOP WATCHING
THE GAME AND GET IN THE GAME.

12:19.139 --> 12:22.512
(laughs) BUT WHAT DO YOU WANT?
THIS IS NOT A SERIOUS
RELATIONSHIP FOR YOU.

12:22.512 --> 12:24.514
YOU NEED TO MOVE ON.

12:24.514 --> 12:27.147
ARE YOU THREATENING ME?

12:27.147 --> 12:30.250
I SAID--
I HEARD YOU.
I JUST HAVEN'T DECIDED YET.

12:30.250 --> 12:34.254
WELL, YOU HAVE MY NUMBER, SO WHY
DON'T YOU CALL ME WHEN YOU KNOW?

12:34.254 --> 12:37.057
OKAY. I DECIDED. BACK OFF.

12:37.057 --> 12:39.029
WELL DONE.

12:39.029 --> 12:40.390
THANK YOU.

12:40.390 --> 12:43.894
HEY, MOM. WHAT'S UP?

12:43.894 --> 12:46.897
I JUST GOT DONE KICKING
SOME SKIN DOCTOR ASS.

12:46.897 --> 12:48.899
THAT'S WHAT'S UP. HOLD ON.

12:48.899 --> 12:51.501
THIS IS GOOD FOR YOU TO SEE.

12:51.501 --> 12:54.274
CAN YOU FORGET
THAT WAS YOUR MOM?
NO PROBLEM.

12:54.274 --> 12:56.776
WHEN A WOMAN HAS JUST
DOMINATED ANOTHER WOMAN,

12:56.776 --> 13:00.450
SHE FEELS FEROCIOUS. THIS IS
A GREAT TIME TO ASK FOR SEX.

13:00.450 --> 13:03.013
MOM'S SORT OF CREEPING
BACK INTO MY HEAD.

13:03.013 --> 13:05.816
I NEVER SAID THIS WAS
GONNA BE EASY. COME ON.

13:05.816 --> 13:08.088
WHY AM I STILL FOLLOWING?

13:08.088 --> 13:11.121
I THOUGHT YOU TWO
WERE FRIENDS.

13:11.121 --> 13:13.523
THAT'S CRAZY TALK. WE ONLY
INTERACT WHEN JULES IS AROUND.

13:13.523 --> 13:17.467
OTHERWISE WE'VE AGREED TO KEEP
A 6-FOOT BUFFER BETWEEN US.

13:17.467 --> 13:20.130
WATCH.

13:20.130 --> 13:23.103
THAT'S A NEAT TRICK.
MM-HMM.

13:23.103 --> 13:26.276
SO WHERE'S JULES?
WELL, SHE'S OFF CONVINCING
DR. EVANS TO STOP USING BOBBY.

13:26.276 --> 13:29.279
BOBBY DOESN'T MIND BEING USED.
HE CALLS IT "GETTING SPONSORED."

13:29.279 --> 13:31.281
SERIOUSLY,
YOU CAN'T EMBARRASS THE GUY.

13:31.281 --> 13:34.814
HE BORROWED AN OLD AQUARIUM FROM
ME TO USE AS A BOAT TOILET.

13:34.814 --> 13:36.816
YOU MIGHT WANT
TO LET HIM KEEP THAT.

13:36.816 --> 13:39.249
REGARDLESS, EVEN BOBBY CAN
END UP LOOKING LIKE A FOOL

13:39.249 --> 13:42.953
IF HE DATES TOO FAR
OUT OF HIS LEAGUE.

13:42.953 --> 13:45.295
HEY, SHOULDN'T YOU GET GOING
TO YOUR DATE?

13:45.295 --> 13:46.596
OH, SCREW IT.

13:46.596 --> 13:48.528
I'M NOT GOING.

13:51.962 --> 13:54.965
I GAVE HER THE WHAT FOR.
WHAT DOES THAT EVEN MEAN?

13:54.965 --> 13:56.967
I DON'T KNOW, BUT I DID IT.

13:56.967 --> 13:59.439
THIS WOMAN IS RUNNING SCARED.

13:59.439 --> 14:02.442
HEY, J-BIRD.
(door closes)

14:02.442 --> 14:06.146
WE JUST CAME BY TO PICK UP TRAV,
BUT HE'S NOT HERE.
HI, JULES.

14:06.146 --> 14:09.449
OH, YOU NEED MORE CHARDONNAY.
AND BETTER CHARDONNAY.

14:09.449 --> 14:11.481
(lowers voice)
RUNNING SCARED.

14:11.481 --> 14:13.283
YOU BETTER RUN SCARED.

14:19.389 --> 14:21.631
THAT WOMAN THINKS
SHE CAN COME INTO MY HOUSE

14:21.631 --> 14:24.634
AND DRINK MY CHEAP WINE.
WELL, WHY DOESN'T
SHE JUST DROP BOBBY?

14:24.634 --> 14:28.168
DOES HE HAVE AN AWESOME PEEP
OR SOMETHING?
ELLIE, I'VE TOLD YOU THIS
A THOUSAND TIMES--

14:28.168 --> 14:30.340
NO MAN HAS
A TRULY AWESOME PEEP.

14:30.340 --> 14:32.342
THEY'RE LIKE UNICORNS.
(door opens and closes)

14:32.342 --> 14:35.145
I JUST WANT TO BELIEVE
ONE EXISTS.
HEY, JULES?

14:35.145 --> 14:37.277
UNICORN.
NOPE.

14:37.277 --> 14:40.410
I FEEL LIKE SOMETHING BAD
JUST HAPPENED.

14:40.410 --> 14:43.153
READY TO GO TO THE MOVIES?
CHANGE OF PLANS.

14:43.153 --> 14:45.255
COME WITH ME.

14:45.255 --> 14:47.557
SO WHY'D YOU BAIL
ON RICHIE RICH?

14:47.557 --> 14:49.289
PLEASE.

14:49.289 --> 14:51.561
HE ONLY ASKED ME OUT
BECAUSE HE THOUGHT

14:51.561 --> 14:54.995
I WAS SOME UPPER-CRUST,
SUIT-WEARING BUSINESS GAL.

14:54.995 --> 14:56.997
SMITH WASN'T ATTRACTED
TO YOU

14:56.997 --> 14:59.199
BECAUSE HE THOUGHT
YOU WERE COUTH.

14:59.199 --> 15:02.202
GRAYSON, THAT IS A WORD THAT
ONLY WOMEN ARE ALLOWED TO USE

15:02.202 --> 15:04.134
WHEN THEY'RE REALLY ANGRY
WITH ANOTHER WOMAN.

15:04.134 --> 15:07.377
"COUTH," YOU KNOW,
LIKE THE OPPOSITE OF "UNCOUTH."

15:07.377 --> 15:10.080
RIGHT. BECAUSE IF I DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT "COUTH" MEANT,

15:10.080 --> 15:13.283
PUTTING AN "UN" IN FRONT OF IT
MAKES IT PERFECTLY CLEAR.

15:13.283 --> 15:15.085
WHO'S DUMB NOW?

15:15.085 --> 15:17.917
OBVIOUSLY, I AM.

15:17.917 --> 15:20.120
HEY, LAURIE.
NOT NOW, TRAVIS.

15:20.120 --> 15:23.293
WHAT THE HELL DID I DO?
IT'S A CLASSIC CASE
OF MISPLACED LADY RAGE.

15:23.293 --> 15:25.595
WE'VE BEEN OVER THIS.
WHAT DO YOU DO?

15:25.595 --> 15:28.959
FIGURE OUT WHAT SHE'S MAD AT
AND THEN BLINDLY AGREE WITH HER.

15:28.959 --> 15:32.332
GOOD. NOW USE YOUR SENSES.
WHERE'S HER ANGER STEMMING FROM?

15:34.664 --> 15:37.407
HEY, LAURIE.

15:37.407 --> 15:39.669
(whispers)
GRAYSON IS SUCH A JERK.

15:39.669 --> 15:42.973
RIGHT?
TRAV, YOU'RE THE BEST.

15:45.575 --> 15:47.677
I AM SO PROUD RIGHT NOW.

15:49.249 --> 15:51.451
WELL, THIS IS NICE, RIGHT?

15:51.451 --> 15:55.285
IT'S HEARTWARMING TO SEE
DIVORCГ©ES WITHOUT BOUNDARIES.

15:55.285 --> 15:57.287
WELL,
YOU DROPPED BY MY PLACE,

15:57.287 --> 15:59.289
SO WE JUST THOUGHT
WE'D DROP BY HERE.

15:59.289 --> 16:02.192
CAN I GET ANOTHER VASE OF WINE?
COMING UP.

16:02.192 --> 16:03.633
THANKS.
JULES?

16:03.633 --> 16:06.696
I'M GOOD FOR A FEW MINUTES.
I SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING.

16:06.696 --> 16:10.700
I BRING OUT YOUR INSECURITIES
IN A WAY THAT EXACERBATES

16:10.700 --> 16:13.203
AN ALREADY BORDERLINE
CODEPENDENT RELATIONSHIP

16:13.203 --> 16:14.544
WITH YOUR EX-HUSBAND.

16:14.544 --> 16:17.207
OH, IT EXACERBATES IT.

16:17.207 --> 16:20.680
(Jeff) STAY CALM.
PIPE DOWN, JEFF. JUST BE HAPPY
THAT YOU'RE HERE.

16:20.680 --> 16:23.253
THAT'S GONNA BE EASY.
I'M THRILLED I'M HERE.

16:23.253 --> 16:25.585
LOOK, I KNOW
YOU'RE SUPER BOOK SMART,

16:25.585 --> 16:29.589
BUT I HAPPEN TO BE SOMETHING
CALLED "STREET SMART."
YEAH, THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE
WHO DIDN'T GO TO COLLEGE

16:29.589 --> 16:31.291
ALWAYS SAY THEY HAVE.

16:31.291 --> 16:34.364
I GOT A CRAP TON
OF STREET SMARTS.

16:34.364 --> 16:36.566
YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE I HAVE, AMY?
COMMON SENSE.

16:36.566 --> 16:39.529
THAT'S THE LITTLE VOICE THAT
SHOULD TELL YOU NOT TO BE AN ASS

16:39.529 --> 16:43.103
WHEN YOU'RE SITTING ON THE EDGE
OF A LAND BOAT.
OKAY, WHY DON'T YOU SHOW ME
WHERE THE BATHROOM IS, HUH?

16:43.103 --> 16:45.105
IT'S RIGHT THERE.
COME ON.

16:45.105 --> 16:46.406
JUST LOOK FOR THE AQUARIUM.

16:46.406 --> 16:49.709
OH, LOOK.
IT'S PROFESSOR VOCABULARY.

16:49.709 --> 16:53.283
LET ME EXPLAIN SOMETHING TO YOU,
TOUGH GIRL.

16:53.283 --> 16:55.285
SMITH DIDN'T WALK OVER TO YOU

16:55.285 --> 16:57.647
BECAUSE HE THOUGHT
YOU LOOKED CLASSY.

16:57.647 --> 17:00.350
HE WALKED OVER BECAUSE HE SAW
YOUR BUTT, BOOBS AND FACE...

17:00.350 --> 17:01.751
IN THAT ORDER.

17:01.751 --> 17:05.024
AND NO MAN IN THE HISTORY
OF THE UNIVERSE HAS EVER SAID,

17:05.024 --> 17:07.727
"YOU KNOW, I MET THIS
REALLY COOL, STONE-COLD HOTTIE,

17:07.727 --> 17:10.460
"BUT I DON'T WANT TO GET NAKED
AND DO AWFUL THINGS TO HER

17:10.460 --> 17:12.432
BECAUSE SHE DOESN'T KNOW
ABOUT POLITICS."

17:12.432 --> 17:16.366
DO YOU REALLY THINK HE WANTS
TO DO AWFUL THINGS TO ME?
WELL, WHO WOULDN'T?

17:16.366 --> 17:18.768
THANKS, GRAYSON.

17:18.768 --> 17:20.770
THAT IS SUPER COUTH OF YOU.

17:22.342 --> 17:25.275
DID I USE IT RIGHT?
CLOSE ENOUGH.

17:25.275 --> 17:27.777
I'M ANGRY AND I JUST PEED
IN A FISH TANK.

17:27.777 --> 17:31.651
I'M--I'M REALLY SORRY
I BROUGHT YOU HERE.
NO, I LOVE THAT YOUR EX-HUSBAND
LIVES ON A BOAT.

17:31.651 --> 17:35.355
(door opens)
THERE IS NO POSSIBLE WAY
I CAN LET YOU DOWN.

17:35.355 --> 17:37.327
(laughs) I LIKE THIS GUY.
HE'S FUNNY.

17:37.327 --> 17:40.330
HOW CAN THIS WOMAN
NOT BE DRIVING YOU CRAZY?

17:40.330 --> 17:42.632
I MEAN, SHE THINKS
SHE'S SO MUCH BETTER THAN YOU.

17:42.632 --> 17:45.635
IF I GOT MAD AT EVERYONE
WHO THOUGHT THEY WERE

17:45.635 --> 17:48.638
BETTER THAN ME, I WOULDN'T
HAVE ANY TIME TO DO STUFF.
WELL, SHE TALKS DOWN
TO EVERYONE.

17:48.638 --> 17:51.571
I MEAN, SHE THINKS SHE'S SMARTER
THAN ME. SMARTER THAN I.

17:51.571 --> 17:53.573
WHICH ONE IS IT?
UH, IT'S SMART--

17:53.573 --> 17:55.475
NO, NO, NO.
DON'T YOU DARE ANSWER.

17:55.475 --> 17:57.777
I-I KNOW THAT YOU THINK
YOU'RE SUPER IMPORTANT

17:57.777 --> 18:01.251
BECAUSE YOU WENT TO HARVARD,
BUT NO ONE REALLY CARES.
I DIDN'T GO TO HARVARD.

18:01.251 --> 18:03.253
WELL, IN MY HEAD YOU DID,

18:03.253 --> 18:06.756
AND YOU'RE ALSO THE CAPTAIN
OF THE CREW TEAM.
THIS IS A WEIRD DAY.

18:06.756 --> 18:09.759
GET USED TO IT, JEFFREY.
YOU HAVE A LITTLE CHIP
ON YOUR SHOULDER

18:09.759 --> 18:13.663
FOR PEOPLE ACT LIKE THEY'RE
SUPER SMART, DON'T YOU?
(scoffs) THAT IS RIDICULOUS.

18:13.663 --> 18:16.496
(whispers) FINE.

18:16.496 --> 18:20.270
I MEAN, I COULD HAVE
FINISHED COLLEGE.
OH, I KNOW. I KNOW.

18:20.270 --> 18:23.373
I MEAN, I ONLY HAD, LIKE, THREE
AND THREE-QUARTER YEARS LEFT.

18:23.373 --> 18:24.734
UGH.

18:24.734 --> 18:28.178
WHY AM I SO INSECURE ABOUT THIS?
IT'S JUST SO STUPID.

18:28.178 --> 18:31.110
IT'S OKAY. HEY, THIS IS
GOOD STUFF FOR ME TO KNOW.

18:31.110 --> 18:33.543
ALL RIGHT, ARE THERE ANY OTHER
QUIRKS THAT I MIGHT RUN INTO?

18:33.543 --> 18:35.885
TAKE HER
TO AN ITALIAN RESTAURANT.

18:35.885 --> 18:40.220
SHE'LL SLIDE
RIGHT INTO THEIR ACCIDENT.
(imitates Italian accent)
YOUR DAUGHTER HAS A MUSTACHE.

18:40.220 --> 18:43.193
(normal voice) WHAT?
THEY LIKE IT WHEN YOU DO THAT.

18:43.193 --> 18:45.425
WELL, IT'S INCREDIBLY RUDE,
EVEN FOR HILLBILLIES,

18:45.425 --> 18:47.427
TO LEAVE ME UP THERE ALONE.

18:47.427 --> 18:49.429
OH, SHE IS HORRIBLE.
RIGHT?

18:49.429 --> 18:52.562
ARE YOU GOING TO DEFEND ME?
DO I HAVE TO?

18:52.562 --> 18:56.306
JUST BRING UP MORE WINE.
MY MUSTARD JAR'S EMPTY.

18:56.306 --> 18:57.367
(groans)

18:57.367 --> 19:00.770
I AM TIRED
FROM SHARING MY GIFT.

19:00.770 --> 19:03.273
(door opens)
ARE YOU A GENIUS?

19:03.273 --> 19:05.715
(footsteps approach)

19:09.319 --> 19:12.682
BABY, ARE YOU LOOKING
FOR YOUR NECKLACE?

19:12.682 --> 19:14.684
I FOUND IT IN THE SHOWER.

19:14.684 --> 19:18.388
A BIG GLOB OF CONDITIONER WAS
ABOUT TO SUCK IT DOWN THE DRAIN.

19:18.388 --> 19:20.760
THANK YOU. I'M SO SORRY
I BARKED AT YOU THIS MORNING.

19:20.760 --> 19:22.732
I'VE BEEN FEELING SO BAD
ABOUT IT.

19:22.732 --> 19:25.795
BUT, BABE, I PROMISE TO MAKE IT
UP TO YOU TONIGHT.

19:25.795 --> 19:27.497
MMM.
MMM.

19:27.497 --> 19:29.939
(The Rifles) в™Є ...IN BED,
ALL OUR DIFFERENCES UNSAID в™Є

19:29.939 --> 19:32.342
MM.
(laughs)

19:32.342 --> 19:34.474
в™Є UNDERNEATH A DREARY GRAY... в™Є

19:34.474 --> 19:39.249
TRAVIS, WOMEN WILL ALWAYS
DRIVE US NUTS,

19:39.249 --> 19:40.850
BUT HAVE COMPASSION,

19:40.850 --> 19:44.314
FOR THEY ONLY BEHAVE THAT WAY
TO PROTECT THEMSELVES.

19:44.314 --> 19:49.389
THEY DATE MEN THEY FEEL SUPERIOR
TO SO THEY CAN'T GET HURT...

19:49.389 --> 19:52.362
BOBBY, HOW AM I SUPPOSED
TO GIVE YOU A PROPER EXAM

19:52.362 --> 19:55.965
WHEN YOU HAVE YOUR GOWN ON
BACKWARDS?

19:55.965 --> 19:57.597
DO I?

19:57.597 --> 20:00.630
FOR SOME REASON,
I'M CRAVING TEA RIGHT NOW.

20:00.630 --> 20:02.632
(Andy) THEY ALMOST MISS OUT
ON STUFF

20:02.632 --> 20:05.875
THEY FEEL
THEY AREN'T GOOD ENOUGH FOR.

20:05.875 --> 20:07.377
THAT IS IMPRESSIVE.

20:07.377 --> 20:09.409
I KNOW. (laughs)

20:09.409 --> 20:12.312
HEY, WHAT IS YOUR LAST NAME?
FRANK.

20:12.312 --> 20:14.784
WHAT? YOU HAVE
A LAST NAME FIRST NAME

20:14.784 --> 20:18.248
AND A FIRST NAME LAST NAME?
TAKE ME HOME RIGHT NOW. (laughs)

20:18.248 --> 20:19.689
OKAY.
GO.

20:19.689 --> 20:23.653
HERE WE GO. "UTOPIAN"--
THAT'S SEVEN LETTERS.

20:23.653 --> 20:24.994
YOUR TURN.

20:24.994 --> 20:26.956
BUT ONCE IN A WHILE,

20:26.956 --> 20:29.459
THEY FIND THE COURAGE
TO JUST BE THEMSELVES,

20:29.459 --> 20:32.632
AND IT'S WORTH THE WAIT.
OKAY, HERE'S THE DEAL.

20:32.632 --> 20:35.234
I'M GONNA USE
A LOT OF 3-LETTER WORDS.

20:35.234 --> 20:36.836
SOME YOU'LL RECOGNIZE,
SOME YOU WON'T,

20:36.836 --> 20:39.409
BECAUSE THEY MAY OR MAY NOT
BE REAL.

20:39.409 --> 20:41.441
I'M OKAY WITH THAT.

20:41.441 --> 20:45.375
OKAY. "Z-I-T."

20:45.375 --> 20:48.318
ZIT.
NICE. AND YOU USED A "Z"
ON A TRIPLE LETTER SCORE.

20:48.318 --> 20:51.281
YES, I DID, JEFF.
WHICH TAKES YOU INTO THE LEAD.

20:51.281 --> 20:54.424
UH-OH, THERE IS AN EARTHQUAKE
HERE ON BED ISLAND.

20:54.424 --> 20:57.557
OH, MY GOODNESS. WHOA!
DO YOU FEEL IT?
WHY DID YOU DO THAT?

20:57.557 --> 21:00.560
OH, I THOUGHT I'D QUIT
WHILE I WAS AHEAD. COME HERE.

21:07.737 --> 21:09.399
THAT LOOKS GOOD.

21:09.399 --> 21:12.271
MMM. IT IS.
YOU WANT TO TASTE?

21:12.271 --> 21:14.444
I REALLY DO.
THEN COME GET ONE.

21:14.444 --> 21:16.446
OKAY, I REALLY DON'T LIKE
THIS JOKE.

21:16.446 --> 21:18.708
SORRY.
SORRY.

21:21.451 --> 21:23.012
MMM.
MMM.

21:23.012 --> 21:25.014
MMM!
ARE THEY THAT GOOD?

21:25.014 --> 21:27.016
MM-HMM.

21:27.016 --> 21:28.758
OHH.

21:28.758 --> 21:29.919
MM.

21:29.919 --> 21:31.361
HUH?

21:31.361 --> 21:33.062
MMM.

21:36.295 --> 21:38.698
ALL RIGHT,
NOW I DON'T LIKE THIS JOKE.
