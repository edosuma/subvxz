00:03.040 --> 00:05.202
I don't hunt anymore.
I found something.

00:05.400 --> 00:06.731
- What was her name?
- Amelia!

00:06.880 --> 00:09.884
Dean, the year that I took off
I had something I've never had.

00:10.040 --> 00:12.247
- Happy birthday.
- A normal life.

00:13.000 --> 00:14.525
You were in purgatory?

00:14.680 --> 00:15.761
It felt pure.

00:17.160 --> 00:18.446
How'd you get out?

00:18.600 --> 00:20.568
- I got something you need.
- What's that?

00:20.720 --> 00:24.088
I show you the door,
you hump my soul to the other side.

00:25.080 --> 00:26.241
We made it, brother.

00:27.560 --> 00:28.721
Cass? Was he there?

00:28.920 --> 00:30.604
Something happened to him down there.

00:32.840 --> 00:34.569
I'm not leaving here without you.

00:35.560 --> 00:38.962
- Kevin Tran, prophet of the Lord.
- It does have a nice ring to it.

00:39.120 --> 00:40.884
- Kevin!
- Hey. What's it say?

00:41.040 --> 00:44.123
That we shouldn't come looking.
Kevin figures we don't need him.

00:44.280 --> 00:45.327
But Crowley still does.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.002
Hello, Quentin.

01:18.080 --> 01:19.809
Benny.

01:22.120 --> 01:23.645
No.

01:23.800 --> 01:26.610
- It can't be. You...
- I get the confusion.

01:27.480 --> 01:31.530
You of all people knew
I was really, truly dead.

01:31.680 --> 01:34.968
After all, you held down my legs,
didn't you?

01:35.120 --> 01:38.203
When The Old Man told Sorento
to saw off my head?

01:41.400 --> 01:43.641
Where is he?

01:44.480 --> 01:45.527
Are you serious?

01:47.480 --> 01:49.642
Did you really think
I'd tell you where he is?

01:49.800 --> 01:54.488
Well, I guess I was kind of hoping
you wouldn't.

01:55.840 --> 02:00.129
On the other hand,
I might show you where he is.

02:03.040 --> 02:06.123
After me and my boys
take off your hands and feet.

02:06.840 --> 02:09.571
Well, don't go through all that trouble
on my account.

02:09.720 --> 02:12.644
Please. You go and crawl your way
out of God's ass...

02:12.800 --> 02:15.371
...for another ride
on the merry-go-round?

02:15.520 --> 02:17.807
The Old Man's gonna wanna see this
for himself.

02:20.960 --> 02:25.727
Well, they might be able to kill me.

02:26.080 --> 02:27.366
And that's all right.

02:28.000 --> 02:32.244
Because if they do,
I know exactly where I'm going.

02:33.080 --> 02:35.367
And who I'll see when I get there.

03:00.000 --> 03:03.527
Well, that is twice that he's burned us.
Shame on you.

03:03.680 --> 03:05.842
No, no, no.
I'm the one who said he set us up.

03:06.000 --> 03:08.446
No, you said,
"I wonder if Kevin is setting us up."

03:08.600 --> 03:10.568
Then you started in
with technobabble.

03:10.720 --> 03:12.768
- That was like two states ago.
- Whatever.

03:13.000 --> 03:16.527
Either way, that's another room
billed to one of Kevin's false credit IDs.

03:16.680 --> 03:19.081
And the motel ran his number today.

03:19.240 --> 03:21.766
- Just like he actually checked in.
- Yes.

03:21.920 --> 03:23.524
The kid's like a Rainman.

03:23.720 --> 03:26.451
He's like a crappy
little credit-card-counting...

03:26.640 --> 03:29.246
...criminal prodigy Rainman.

03:29.400 --> 03:31.721
Well, he was in advanced placement.

03:32.440 --> 03:35.762
Shut up. When is that little idiot
gonna stop running from us?

03:35.920 --> 03:39.606
I don't know, Dean.
I mean, you did try to kill his mother.

03:40.280 --> 03:43.045
I was trying to kill Crowley. Okay?

03:43.240 --> 03:46.289
Who happened to be wearing
Kevin's mother at the time.

03:46.440 --> 03:48.966
- Well, there's a difference.
- Apparently not to Kevin.

03:49.160 --> 03:51.447
Oh, I know, maybe because,
oh, yeah, it's his mother.

03:52.960 --> 03:57.124
Hold that thought. No, actually,
you know what? Don't hold that thought.

03:57.920 --> 03:59.570
Hello.

04:01.160 --> 04:02.810
Hello?

04:04.280 --> 04:07.124
Uh, hang on. There's not enough bars.

04:13.960 --> 04:15.086
Benny?

04:15.240 --> 04:18.449
Hey, Dean.

04:18.640 --> 04:20.290
You, um...

04:20.560 --> 04:22.642
You got a minute?

04:27.840 --> 04:29.808
Afraid I messed up, buddy.

04:31.920 --> 04:33.081
What did you do?

04:34.480 --> 04:37.006
No, man. Not like that.

04:48.840 --> 04:50.842
I'm sorry. You took on how many?

04:51.000 --> 04:53.002
- What, are you crazy?
- Hey.

04:54.160 --> 04:58.688
See, the thing is,
my legs ain't working so good.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.365
There's a...

05:03.880 --> 05:07.248
...fuel barge not too far from here.

05:07.800 --> 05:10.121
I'm pretty sure I can make it
at a slow crawl.

05:12.040 --> 05:16.602
I was kind of hoping maybe
I could ask you for one more favor.

05:17.400 --> 05:20.404
And what exactly is that supposed
to mean, you've got to go?

05:20.600 --> 05:23.251
- Which words are giving you trouble?
- We're on the case.

05:23.400 --> 05:26.529
The "Winchester holy grail,
shut the gates of hell" case?

05:26.720 --> 05:30.361
Sure are. But to close the gates of hell
we need our prophet, am I right?

05:30.520 --> 05:33.091
So step one: Find Kevin Tran.

05:33.240 --> 05:35.607
Well, he ain't here.
But he wanted us to be.

05:35.760 --> 05:39.446
Which means we're probably as far away
from him as he could possibly put us.

05:39.640 --> 05:42.883
So step two: Find Kevin Tran.

05:43.880 --> 05:45.530
You mind if I take the Toblerone?

05:46.560 --> 05:49.450
Wait. Dean, seriously?

05:49.640 --> 05:51.722
The trail is dead,
but the room is paid for.

05:51.880 --> 05:54.884
You got research,
I got personal crap I gotta take care of.

05:55.080 --> 05:56.570
What does that mean, personal?

05:56.720 --> 05:57.846
Did you have a stroke?

05:59.080 --> 06:00.411
Vocabulary. Personal.

06:00.560 --> 06:03.689
As in my own, grown-up personal,
I don't know, crap.

06:05.640 --> 06:07.244
- Damn it...
- What, Sam?

06:07.400 --> 06:10.404
Last I counted, you took a year off
from the job. I need a day.

06:59.320 --> 07:02.608
You are a wascally wabbit, Mr. Tran.

07:15.760 --> 07:17.808
Concerned. Ahem.

07:17.960 --> 07:20.008
Not stalking.

07:20.440 --> 07:22.124
Concerned.

08:00.280 --> 08:02.806
Everett. Hey, buddy. You still on duty?

08:03.000 --> 08:04.286
Yeah.

08:04.800 --> 08:06.165
How's your dad?

08:06.320 --> 08:08.209
He's having it rough
on the new regimen.

08:08.360 --> 08:09.566
Can't keep anything down.

08:10.680 --> 08:12.523
That sucks.

08:12.920 --> 08:15.082
Listen, um, I'm gonna stay on another week.
Okay?

08:15.280 --> 08:18.250
Run it on this card.
I just canceled the one you got on file.

08:18.400 --> 08:19.890
Okay, sure.

08:20.040 --> 08:22.850
Figured you'd have moved on by now.

08:23.200 --> 08:26.921
Right. Well, I'm kind
of between jobs, uh...

08:28.280 --> 08:32.001
Plus, uh, Dog has a surgery follow-up
on Tuesday.

08:32.159 --> 08:34.322
Yeah. You really messed up that dog.

08:34.919 --> 08:37.446
Heh. Right. Uh, thanks for that.

08:37.600 --> 08:41.571
Aw, yeah. It's all that thing does.

08:42.080 --> 08:44.082
Piss, moan
and eat up money we ain't got.

08:44.240 --> 08:45.366
You got any tools?

08:45.920 --> 08:49.083
Hell, if you can fix it,
you don't need to go and look for a job.

08:49.920 --> 08:51.922
You got one here.

09:55.280 --> 09:56.930
Benny.

10:23.480 --> 10:24.845
Benny.

10:28.160 --> 10:29.730
Well, looking good.

10:31.440 --> 10:33.363
UP yours.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.128
Wow. You, uh...

10:46.800 --> 10:48.165
...look okay.

10:48.320 --> 10:50.163
Getting there.

10:50.320 --> 10:51.924
Dude, you were double hamstrung.

10:53.000 --> 10:56.971
Yeah, well, a little rest,
a half a cooler full of AB negative...

10:57.120 --> 11:00.124
...most wounds, short of amputation,
will mend up.

11:00.280 --> 11:01.361
Vampirically speaking.

11:02.520 --> 11:04.363
Uh-huh.

11:04.960 --> 11:06.962
Be a hundred percent
before you know it.

11:08.520 --> 11:10.204
Thank you, brother.

11:10.400 --> 11:12.402
Benny, what's going on?

11:12.560 --> 11:14.881
Oh, your work here is done, Dean.

11:15.520 --> 11:17.522
You already saved the day.

11:17.680 --> 11:21.810
You know, I got my, uh, deal and you got...
What did you call it?

11:21.960 --> 11:23.644
- The family business?
- Benny.

11:25.320 --> 11:26.845
What's going on?

11:30.240 --> 11:33.722
You and that whole friend thing, man.

11:47.760 --> 11:50.240
I gotta admit,
the angel's got his strong points.

11:50.440 --> 11:53.091
But holy hell if he ain't a magnet.

11:53.240 --> 11:55.447
Before we found Cass,
you said my humanity...

11:55.600 --> 11:58.171
- ...was drawing too much attention.
- Yeah, that too.

11:58.360 --> 12:00.931
Well, I think we're clear
for the moment.

12:01.080 --> 12:04.289
Does present a curious curl
in the metaphysics, doesn't it?

12:04.480 --> 12:06.926
Murder a monster in Monster Heaven,
where does it go?

12:07.120 --> 12:09.771
And this is the crazy aunt
I wanna take on the road?

12:10.280 --> 12:12.601
I am not your aunt.

12:12.760 --> 12:13.966
What? Really?

12:14.120 --> 12:16.600
I have no relationship
to your sibling offspring.

12:16.760 --> 12:19.684
- No, you're kidding.
- Oh, you two are killing me.

12:20.800 --> 12:22.609
I have to agree with the vampire,
Dean.

12:22.800 --> 12:27.089
The risk of crossing purgatory
with a seraph, it's less than strategic.

12:27.640 --> 12:31.565
When we have no reason to believe I can
pass through the door you're headed for.

12:31.720 --> 12:35.042
You're an intact, living human being
stuck in purgatory's craw.

12:35.200 --> 12:37.248
This dimension wants to spit you out.

12:37.440 --> 12:39.966
Which is exactly what's gonna power
our escape pod.

12:40.120 --> 12:41.963
I'm sure I can squeeze through too...

12:42.120 --> 12:45.488
...because after all,
you take away the fangs and the fun...

12:45.640 --> 12:46.801
...I was born human too.

12:48.280 --> 12:51.045
- But...
- I don't think it will work for me.

12:52.800 --> 12:55.406
You hear what he's telling you?
Your buddy is saying...

12:55.560 --> 12:57.130
Listen, you undead blood junkie.

12:57.600 --> 13:00.126
I'm the one with the mojo.
I'm the one with the plan.

13:00.280 --> 13:04.001
Cass, we're gonna shove your ass
back through the eye of that needle...

13:04.160 --> 13:06.242
...if it kills all three of us.

13:07.080 --> 13:10.289
Obviously,
I'm less than comfortable with that.

13:10.440 --> 13:13.683
Well, it's good to know
you're still dumb as ever.

13:13.840 --> 13:15.330
Well, some things never change.

13:15.560 --> 13:18.848
Now, why are you getting
into machete fights with your own kind?

13:20.000 --> 13:24.642
Quentin, the one I came for,
we were in the same nest.

13:25.160 --> 13:28.004
I'm hunting the vampire
who turned me.

13:28.200 --> 13:29.850
My maker.

13:33.160 --> 13:37.768
Well, now, don't get me wrong,
I'm down with the hunting, but, uh, why?

13:37.960 --> 13:41.123
To kill him before he kills me.

13:41.280 --> 13:42.441
Again.

14:09.800 --> 14:11.245
Awesome.

14:11.400 --> 14:14.722
Uh, if you're still on the clock,
lady in 118 said the sink's backed up.

14:23.040 --> 14:25.486
What the hell? What are you doing here?

14:25.640 --> 14:29.361
I knew there was something off, with
your creepy Army Navy, your sideburns.

14:29.520 --> 14:32.490
Stop! Stop.
Um, I'm fixing your sink.

14:33.160 --> 14:34.241
What?

14:38.760 --> 14:41.047
Quentin and I went way back.

14:41.200 --> 14:44.443
One of The Old Man's favorites
next to me, it turns out.

14:45.840 --> 14:46.921
Hey, listen to this.

14:47.080 --> 14:51.449
"Age of Aquarius II, 0800." Then there's
some other numbers all crossed out.

14:51.600 --> 14:54.922
Some other weird names here too.
The Big Mermaid, Solitaire.

14:55.120 --> 14:57.691
It's all crossed out.
Except this one, The Lucky Myra.

14:57.840 --> 14:59.604
Yachts.

14:59.760 --> 15:01.091
Names of yachts.

15:01.240 --> 15:04.369
Lucky Myra, Age of Aquarius II.

15:04.520 --> 15:08.764
Look at this one. Sea You Later,
spelled S-E-A. I mean, come on.

15:09.800 --> 15:11.564
So then these are launch times?

15:11.760 --> 15:15.287
- And, what, destinations?
- Mm-hm. Except none of them ever get there.

15:15.440 --> 15:18.728
Lucky Myra left yesterday.
I guarantee you it's already been hit.

15:18.880 --> 15:19.961
What do you mean hit?

15:21.240 --> 15:23.686
Boarded, burned and buried at sea.

15:25.040 --> 15:27.327
My nest, that's how we fed.

15:27.480 --> 15:28.970
How we always fed.

15:29.760 --> 15:33.890
We kept a tight little fleet,
maybe half a dozen boats.

15:34.040 --> 15:37.089
Nothing ostentatious,
just pleasure craft.

15:37.240 --> 15:40.005
Must have circled the Americas
10 times during my tour.

15:40.480 --> 15:44.246
Few of us act as stringers, troll harbors,
looking for the right size target.

15:44.400 --> 15:48.291
Fat rich yachts going to far-off ports.

15:48.440 --> 15:52.001
Take down the boat's name, destination.
Radio it to the crew on the water.

15:52.960 --> 15:58.000
And then we just, uh, let the ocean
swallow up all our sins.

16:03.760 --> 16:06.366
Vampire pirates.
That's what you guys are.

16:07.680 --> 16:08.920
Vampirates.

16:10.120 --> 16:14.364
Heh. All the years we ran together,
can't believe nobody ever thought of that.

16:14.520 --> 16:17.000
What do you mean?
It's like the third thing you say.

16:17.240 --> 16:18.366
No, it isn't.

16:21.040 --> 16:24.169
All right. So your maker is set up
to feed around here, right?

16:25.040 --> 16:26.451
What are we looking for?

16:26.600 --> 16:28.329
Well, he likes to live in style.

16:28.480 --> 16:30.448
Usually rents legitimately.

16:30.600 --> 16:33.524
Always remote, always coastal.

16:33.760 --> 16:36.161
So an island, maybe?
Got a cable bill here.

16:36.800 --> 16:38.245
Quentin's got the NFL Package.

16:39.640 --> 16:42.007
Prentiss Island.

16:42.160 --> 16:43.571
Heard of it?

16:43.760 --> 16:45.171
Oh, yeah.

16:46.280 --> 16:48.487
Okay. So if you were
your maker's favorite...

16:48.640 --> 16:50.005
...why did he kill you?

16:51.520 --> 16:52.806
When you get turned...

16:52.960 --> 16:56.362
...it's like you're reborn
into the vampire nest.

16:56.520 --> 16:58.887
Your maker,
he means everything to you.

16:59.040 --> 17:01.850
I mean,
you really start believing he's God.

17:02.360 --> 17:05.569
Now, if your maker happens to believe
the same thing, well...

17:05.720 --> 17:08.484
- I see how that could be a pickle.
- Mm.

17:09.400 --> 17:12.210
You really have to do that?
I mean, right now?

17:14.800 --> 17:16.211
I'm sorry, brother.

17:16.359 --> 17:19.762
- I'm better, but I'm still on the mend.
- Right.

17:20.079 --> 17:21.763
Anyway...

17:21.920 --> 17:25.685
Our father, he was a jealous god.

17:25.839 --> 17:30.209
Kept the family together, but kept us
apart from the rest of the world.

17:30.400 --> 17:31.890
Always at sea.

17:33.280 --> 17:36.887
I always did
what was best for the nest.

17:37.200 --> 17:39.328
Till I met her.

17:40.200 --> 17:42.123
Andrea.

17:42.520 --> 17:45.410
Andrea Kormos.

17:45.920 --> 17:47.763
Beautiful.

17:47.960 --> 17:50.770
I mean, words don't even cut it,
you know?

17:50.960 --> 17:52.803
Greek. An heiress.

17:52.960 --> 17:54.803
Come on.

17:54.960 --> 17:58.806
She was sailing a 42-foot sloop
to the Canary Islands.

17:58.960 --> 18:02.726
Now, I should've called
her boat's destination in to my crew...

18:02.880 --> 18:06.089
but instead I joined her on it.

18:06.240 --> 18:07.401
Seriously.

18:08.960 --> 18:13.124
Was Fabio on the cover of that paperback?
Ha, ha.

18:14.920 --> 18:17.321
My life changed
when she entered it, Dean.

18:17.840 --> 18:20.730
Everything I'd been
or done up to that point...

18:20.880 --> 18:26.728
...just seemed to vanish
into what we had become together.

18:27.840 --> 18:31.890
I mean, we found it, man.

18:34.000 --> 18:36.287
Eventually, we settled in Louisiana.

18:36.440 --> 18:38.442
And then one night,
we were coming home...

18:39.840 --> 18:44.607
...and The Old Man, he was just there,
with Quentin and Sorento.

18:44.760 --> 18:46.683
My oldest nest mates.

18:47.520 --> 18:52.651
It was only that night I understood
what a crime it was to him...

18:52.920 --> 18:54.888
...for me to leave them.

18:55.920 --> 19:00.209
They pinned me down
and they beheaded me.

19:01.680 --> 19:04.524
The last thing I saw
was The Old Man...

19:05.520 --> 19:08.205
...tearing out Andrea's throat.

19:11.120 --> 19:14.681
Well, that's what payback's all about,
am I right?

19:17.040 --> 19:20.726
The docks are up ahead.
Should be able to find a dinghy to use.

20:08.680 --> 20:10.682
We're close.

20:19.520 --> 20:20.885
Remind you of anything?

20:29.720 --> 20:32.530
It's weird, being back.

20:33.120 --> 20:35.248
In the world, I mean.

20:35.560 --> 20:37.244
Isn't it?

20:37.560 --> 20:40.882
- Sure as hell is.
- I mean, what do you do with it all?

20:41.520 --> 20:44.410
All the... All the everything.

20:46.120 --> 20:48.646
Hell, I don't even know
if this world is real.

20:49.120 --> 20:50.451
If I'm real.

20:50.640 --> 20:52.210
Hey, listen to me.

20:52.360 --> 20:54.886
I've seen what happens
down that rabbit hole.

20:55.040 --> 20:57.247
Okay? We're real.

20:57.440 --> 20:58.771
Benny, this is real.

20:59.440 --> 21:02.205
It's the only way to play this game.
You get me?

21:33.680 --> 21:35.011
Time to move, Benny.

21:36.320 --> 21:37.970
The Old Man's harpsichord.

21:38.520 --> 21:39.681
Benny.

21:48.520 --> 21:50.124
No.

21:50.800 --> 21:52.802
No, no.

22:10.520 --> 22:11.726
Benny?

22:13.080 --> 22:14.889
Andrea.

22:42.200 --> 22:43.611
Idiot.

22:52.560 --> 22:55.643
You're gonna make me do this
all over again, aren't you?

22:55.800 --> 22:58.246
Hello, Sorento.

23:01.720 --> 23:03.085
He turned you.

23:18.440 --> 23:20.568
Little busy right now.

23:39.520 --> 23:41.363
This is Dean's other other cell...

23:41.560 --> 23:43.801
...so you must know what to do.

23:51.320 --> 23:53.971
So that's what you do?
You stalk helpless women...

23:54.160 --> 23:57.323
...and you break into their motel room
and you fix their plumbing?

23:57.960 --> 23:59.325
Why are you fixing my sink?

24:00.440 --> 24:04.650
Well, because somebody jammed
about 800 limes down the drain.

24:04.800 --> 24:06.962
Blew out the disposal.

24:07.120 --> 24:09.851
- Oh. Right. Don't touch the produce.
- Right.

24:10.000 --> 24:13.209
- I thought you were leaving town.
- I am. I'm just helping out...

24:13.360 --> 24:16.523
...with maintenance at the motel
while Everett's dad is sick.

24:16.760 --> 24:18.489
Who's Everett?

24:19.800 --> 24:22.167
- How long have you been here?
- Three months. Why?

24:23.280 --> 24:25.886
You know, usually
when someone moves into a town...

24:26.040 --> 24:29.681
...they actually, uh, you know,
move into the town.

24:30.520 --> 24:31.885
I did.

24:32.040 --> 24:35.203
A motel is not actually part of the town
that it's in.

24:35.360 --> 24:37.522
It's not part of anywhere.

24:39.160 --> 24:41.322
Well, I haven't found a place yet.

24:41.480 --> 24:43.209
Why am I explaining myself to you?

24:43.360 --> 24:45.522
You're a drifter. Or a handyman.

24:45.680 --> 24:48.843
- I think I should just go.
- Yeah, I think you should go.

25:05.040 --> 25:07.691
- Hey.
- Okay, what?

25:07.880 --> 25:11.009
- What?
- Why did you call me?

25:11.560 --> 25:13.403
Why are you whispering?

25:13.560 --> 25:15.562
It's kind of hard to explain that.

25:15.720 --> 25:19.361
I'm cleaning out a vampire's nest.
It's sort of gone a little sideways.

25:19.520 --> 25:21.090
What? Are you an idiot, Dean?

25:21.240 --> 25:23.607
- You know better than to go alone.
- I'm not alone.

25:23.800 --> 25:25.962
All right? I'm not alone.

25:26.440 --> 25:29.046
I've got backup.
A guy who's been tracking the nest.

25:29.200 --> 25:30.770
What guy? Garth?

25:30.960 --> 25:32.371
What? No.

25:32.520 --> 25:35.763
- You don't know him. He's a friend.
- A friend? You don't have any...

25:35.920 --> 25:39.367
- All your friends are dead.
- That's not what I called to talk about.

25:39.560 --> 25:42.723
Sorento, go. Tell The Old Man it's true.

25:46.320 --> 25:48.129
He listens to you?

25:49.080 --> 25:51.242
It's been a long time.

25:51.880 --> 25:55.771
Our father has come to trust
my judgment over Sorento's.

25:56.440 --> 25:58.249
I answer only to him.

25:59.160 --> 26:02.243
Well, sleeping with God
has gotta have some perks.

26:08.840 --> 26:11.161
Yes, it does.

26:12.720 --> 26:15.803
Make sure The Old Man
has everything he needs.

26:33.760 --> 26:35.489
Oh, Benny.

26:37.120 --> 26:40.681
When I heard you were back, I don't
know, somehow I knew it was true.

26:40.880 --> 26:42.370
I had to believe it.

26:42.520 --> 26:43.806
To hope.

26:43.960 --> 26:45.644
Andrea, what happened?

26:45.800 --> 26:49.407
The Old Man said
he was gonna bleed you dry.

26:50.960 --> 26:53.122
I don't know, he changed his mind.

26:53.280 --> 26:57.330
I blacked out. When I woke up,
I was drinking from his wrist.

26:58.280 --> 26:59.805
I'm sorry.

26:59.960 --> 27:02.691
- All this, it's because of me. I'm sorry.
- No.

27:02.840 --> 27:05.127
It's not your fault.

27:05.280 --> 27:08.523
You never hid anything from me,
Benny.

27:08.680 --> 27:10.205
I chose you.

27:11.680 --> 27:13.489
But why'd you stay?

27:15.000 --> 27:17.571
With them. With him.

27:17.720 --> 27:19.165
Why?

27:20.040 --> 27:22.327
You remember what it's like at first.

27:24.480 --> 27:27.051
First everything resets.

27:28.160 --> 27:31.846
Life is blood, that's all.

27:32.560 --> 27:35.040
- And whoever gives it to you...
- I know.

27:35.200 --> 27:36.725
It's complicated.

27:37.840 --> 27:40.889
Every damn thing is complicated.

27:43.200 --> 27:44.326
Doesn't have to be.

27:45.520 --> 27:47.841
- Andrea.
- Benny, I can't kill him.

27:48.320 --> 27:50.163
None of us can.

27:50.320 --> 27:52.084
But you...

27:52.520 --> 27:53.885
You came back from the grave.

27:54.600 --> 27:56.728
You're proof
that he's not all powerful.

27:56.880 --> 27:58.166
That he's not God.

27:59.560 --> 28:02.564
He's scared of you, Benny. I know it.

28:07.880 --> 28:11.726
You understand that I came back
to burn his operation to the ground.

28:11.880 --> 28:13.689
To stop the killing.

28:18.120 --> 28:21.090
Do what you came for,
and we can be together.

28:27.040 --> 28:29.361
He wants Benny brought to him.

28:32.280 --> 28:35.250
I get the separate
lives thing, but this is a hunting thing...

28:35.440 --> 28:38.250
Oh, my God. Stop talking.
I texted you my 20.

28:39.760 --> 28:41.888
Yeah, I got it. Look, I'm on my way.

28:42.040 --> 28:45.761
And, listen, if you handle it, great.
I'll buy your friend the first round.

28:45.920 --> 28:48.002
But, Dean, listen to me...

28:48.720 --> 28:50.324
Dean?

28:50.640 --> 28:51.766
Dean, are you there?

28:51.920 --> 28:54.730
Dean? Dean?

28:54.880 --> 28:56.644
Are you kidding me?

29:02.240 --> 29:04.811
Oh, man. Come on.

29:06.280 --> 29:07.964
Damn it.

29:24.040 --> 29:26.042
Hello, Father.

29:26.240 --> 29:27.321
Benny.

29:29.120 --> 29:32.567
- I have no words.
- Now, I know that ain't true.

29:35.040 --> 29:36.485
Can you help us understand?

29:37.080 --> 29:38.730
I know you don't owe us anything.

29:38.920 --> 29:40.251
But how?

29:40.400 --> 29:42.721
How are you here,
standing in front of me?

29:43.320 --> 29:44.810
I found a way back.

29:45.280 --> 29:48.124
- From hell?
- Right next door, as far as I could tell.

29:48.280 --> 29:50.328
Next door. What's that?

29:51.280 --> 29:53.965
Oh, I think I'll just have to show you.

29:58.520 --> 30:00.522
I know it won't change anything...

30:00.680 --> 30:02.523
...but I regretted having you killed.

30:03.440 --> 30:07.525
When it was all done, I wailed
when I saw you in all those pieces.

30:08.800 --> 30:10.370
Didn't I, Sorento?

30:10.520 --> 30:13.364
Didn't I wail like the ugliest baby
in the world?

30:13.560 --> 30:14.641
Yes, Father.

30:14.800 --> 30:17.007
That's when you decided
to turn his cow.

30:18.520 --> 30:19.851
Poor So-So is bitter...

30:20.040 --> 30:23.362
...because your cow outranks him now.

30:23.520 --> 30:25.363
Why didn't you let her die?

30:25.520 --> 30:28.364
- She meant nothing to you.
- But she meant everything to you.

30:29.320 --> 30:31.846
If that's all I could salvage
from my wayward son...

30:32.000 --> 30:35.368
...the woman he defied his maker for.

30:36.040 --> 30:38.008
I wanted someone
to remember you by.

30:58.640 --> 31:01.928
What the hell do you know about
the value of life? You're a vampire.

31:02.120 --> 31:06.045
Yep. And I think we both know
which of our kinds kills more humans.

31:06.200 --> 31:08.089
Statistically speaking, that'd be your...

31:08.240 --> 31:09.526
Yes, thank you, Cass.

31:10.080 --> 31:11.411
I get it.

31:11.600 --> 31:14.365
You're worried what I might do
if we make it topside.

31:14.520 --> 31:16.761
That I'll start eating your little piggies.

31:16.920 --> 31:18.684
I already told you, man.

31:18.840 --> 31:22.208
By the time I got iced,
I was strictly on blood transfusions.

31:22.400 --> 31:24.004
Donated blood.

31:24.160 --> 31:26.162
Not donated to me, I'll give you that...

31:26.360 --> 31:28.761
...but I paid good black market scratch
for it.

31:28.920 --> 31:31.685
So, what is that,
like the vampire zone diet?

31:31.840 --> 31:35.925
Look, all I'm saying is I started
seeing something in humanity, okay?

31:36.160 --> 31:39.562
Something that shouldn't be taken.
I drink blood. I don't drink people.

31:39.720 --> 31:40.960
Why should I believe you?

31:41.120 --> 31:43.771
Does it matter?
You got your head so far up your ass...

31:43.960 --> 31:47.407
...you don't even realize
we're already done for. Angel knows it.

31:47.560 --> 31:50.131
We are never gonna make it
with him next to us...

31:50.280 --> 31:52.726
...glowing like a beacon.

31:53.280 --> 31:56.887
Do I need to remind you of our deal?
Of what you committed to?

31:57.040 --> 32:00.806
- He is gonna get us killed!
- We may get to test that theory.

32:00.960 --> 32:02.724
- More monsters?
- Leviathan.

32:02.880 --> 32:05.963
- Why don't you blip out of here?
- They're too close. I can't.

32:06.160 --> 32:07.321
Run.

32:38.720 --> 32:40.529
No, no, no. Dog. Dog. Oh.

32:40.720 --> 32:45.009
Dog, don't bother the angry lady.

32:45.160 --> 32:47.367
Uh, hey. Sorry.

32:47.520 --> 32:49.841
Dog? That's what you're calling him?

32:50.720 --> 32:51.846
Uh...

32:53.160 --> 32:54.525
Well, it's accurate.

32:55.360 --> 32:57.203
Is Dog taking his antibiotics?

32:57.360 --> 33:01.365
Uh, yes, he is. He's doing much better.
Thank you.

33:05.240 --> 33:11.521
You know, um, I have to say, um,
I've seen a lot of stitches in my time...

33:11.720 --> 33:14.530
...and you've got really good hands.

33:16.000 --> 33:17.206
Thank you.

33:19.880 --> 33:22.121
So you think I'm creepy?

33:22.800 --> 33:25.804
I think it's creepy you buy
all your clothing at Army Surplus.

33:25.960 --> 33:28.804
- White supremacists do that.
- Yeah, but I'm not...

33:28.960 --> 33:30.724
- Serial killers do that.
- Fair enough.

33:30.880 --> 33:34.646
You come from nowhere, appear to be
going nowhere. You've "seen stitches."

33:34.800 --> 33:36.245
It's all pretty solid creepy.

33:51.080 --> 33:54.084
You have no idea
where you're going either, do you?

33:55.000 --> 33:57.731
No. Not really.

34:00.320 --> 34:02.607
And that's because you have no one.

34:04.520 --> 34:06.170
I mean, at all. Right?

34:08.280 --> 34:12.524
I mean, that's why you're here.
In this place.

34:17.920 --> 34:19.842
I used to.

34:20.000 --> 34:22.002
Have someone, I mean.

34:22.199 --> 34:24.089
But that's over now.

34:25.040 --> 34:26.849
That's gone.

34:32.239 --> 34:34.719
You know what that's like, don't you?

34:37.320 --> 34:39.971
This is Dean's other other...

34:44.719 --> 34:46.722
I suppose
you coming back from the dead...

34:46.880 --> 34:50.362
...well, that's the definition of mutiny,
isn't it?

34:54.040 --> 34:57.965
All of this has me feeling so tired.

34:58.120 --> 35:01.602
- You should have let me go.
- But, Benny, I don't let things go.

35:01.760 --> 35:06.800
Really? You've lived so long.
How is it you have so little? Hmm?

35:06.960 --> 35:10.646
Nothing but a beat up old harpsichord
and a nest of hyenas.

35:11.400 --> 35:12.640
I have the sea.

35:14.240 --> 35:15.810
- And I have Andrea.
- No.

35:16.360 --> 35:17.441
You don't have her.

35:19.400 --> 35:21.004
At least that much I know.

35:23.160 --> 35:24.605
Ah. That dumb bitch.

35:36.160 --> 35:40.006
- When did you learn to fight like that?
- I've had a lot of practice.

35:49.600 --> 35:52.126
- You're just gonna sit there?
- You're right.

35:52.280 --> 35:54.965
I've been here so, so long, Benny.

35:56.160 --> 35:59.528
Seen all the outcomes, all the patterns,
a trillion times.

36:00.520 --> 36:02.204
It all means so little.

36:02.960 --> 36:07.204
This universe is a pyramid of despair.
Nothing else.

36:07.360 --> 36:08.566
A little dark.

36:10.200 --> 36:12.328
I am evil, after all.

36:12.520 --> 36:15.000
At least I've had that much
to keep me cold at night.

36:15.720 --> 36:17.563
You never had that, did you?

36:17.720 --> 36:19.643
Everything had to be thought about.

36:19.800 --> 36:20.881
Considered.

36:21.040 --> 36:24.249
You know what Socrates said
about a life unconsidered.

36:24.400 --> 36:27.722
Yes. But what we have in us?

36:27.880 --> 36:30.565
Benny, that's not life.

36:31.480 --> 36:33.562
That's what you still don't get.

36:33.720 --> 36:36.087
That's why it's always been so hard
for you.

36:36.240 --> 36:38.447
My poor Benjamin.

36:42.960 --> 36:44.724
Get up.

36:46.040 --> 36:48.611
This is the one last thing
I can take from you.

36:48.760 --> 36:50.091
No.

36:50.240 --> 36:52.368
You try, damn it.
You try and kill me again.

36:52.560 --> 36:54.005
This is my story, you gnat.

36:54.160 --> 36:57.084
- Get up!
- It ends the way I choose. Not you.

36:59.920 --> 37:05.211
Well, at least I can finally show you
something new, Old Man.

37:05.880 --> 37:09.601
A whole new world.

37:23.520 --> 37:25.409
The Old Man is dead.

37:29.280 --> 37:31.009
Let's go.

37:35.200 --> 37:38.283
- Where, Benny?
- What are you talking about?

37:38.760 --> 37:40.125
Anywhere.

37:46.760 --> 37:49.161
You're not leaving here, are you?

37:52.280 --> 37:53.327
And you never were.

37:53.520 --> 37:56.330
We have everything we need
right here.

37:59.600 --> 38:02.809
The operation is still perfect.

38:02.960 --> 38:06.487
We can ride the high seas,
plunder together.

38:08.680 --> 38:11.331
We can have the life
we always wanted.

38:13.760 --> 38:18.687
What I wanted
was to leave a burning crater behind.

38:20.440 --> 38:23.683
I wanted to put your memory to rest.

38:24.280 --> 38:26.487
But I'm not a memory.

38:26.760 --> 38:28.125
Benny, I'm right here.

38:33.520 --> 38:35.522
What I loved...

38:36.760 --> 38:38.444
...it ain't here anymore.

38:39.680 --> 38:44.083
It was snuffed out a long time ago
by monsters like me.

38:45.880 --> 38:48.201
Like what you've become.

38:50.160 --> 38:53.164
- You think you're better than me now?
- No.

38:54.000 --> 38:55.843
I think we're all damned.

39:29.240 --> 39:31.083
Why'd you do it, Dean?

39:32.920 --> 39:34.046
Do what?

39:35.240 --> 39:36.651
Resurrect me.

39:38.400 --> 39:40.767
You could've drained my soul
into any culvert...

39:40.920 --> 39:44.925
- ...and no one would've been the wiser.
- What the hell are you talking about?

39:45.120 --> 39:46.406
Hey, you good?

39:48.400 --> 39:50.050
Man.

39:50.640 --> 39:52.369
I don't know what I am.

40:17.560 --> 40:18.800
Oh, great.

41:09.240 --> 41:11.129
I'm Benny.

41:14.280 --> 41:15.850
I've heard a lot about you, Sam.

41:34.880 --> 41:37.884
I can see you two have a lot
to talk about.
