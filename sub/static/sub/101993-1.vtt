WEBVTT

00:33.208 --> 00:35.410
<i>And roll sound, please.</i>

00:38.547 --> 00:41.249
<i>All right,
so just be thinking of anything</i>

00:41.283 --> 00:43.452
<i>you'd like to include
while we set up.</i>

00:43.485 --> 00:46.889
<i>We'll be ready to get started
in just a minute.</i>

00:46.923 --> 00:48.323
<i>All right.</i>

00:50.727 --> 00:53.730
<i>Do you know
anything about his parents?</i>

00:53.763 --> 00:55.630
<i>A few things.</i>

00:55.664 --> 00:59.736
<i>Good, because we couldn't
find anything,</i>

00:59.769 --> 01:04.006
<i>and we also couldn't find any
military records for a Mickey Kelley.</i>

01:06.575 --> 01:10.245
<i>Yeah. Well,
there's a reason for that.</i>

01:11.480 --> 01:13.381
<i>Which is?</i>

01:13.415 --> 01:15.785
<i>How much time you got?</i>

01:15.818 --> 01:17.619
<i>As long as it takes.</i>

01:18.888 --> 01:20.757
We're rolling.

01:20.790 --> 01:23.993
Okay, just start by
telling us how you two met.

01:26.495 --> 01:31.000
I met Mickey Kelley later on in our
lives, back in 1991,

01:31.033 --> 01:33.635
when he had just gotten back
from Desert Storm.

01:33.668 --> 01:35.705
He retired from the Marines.

01:35.738 --> 01:38.941
I was working at a
restaurant called El Patio.

01:38.975 --> 01:41.643
I was valeting cars.

01:41.677 --> 01:43.612
<i>Mick was just a customer,</i>

01:43.645 --> 01:45.580
<i>when this asshole cut in line,</i>

01:45.614 --> 01:47.750
<i>ordered me
to get his ride first.</i>

01:47.784 --> 01:50.787
<i>When I said no,
he started calling me names.</i>

01:50.820 --> 01:53.956
Shit like "beaner", "taco."

01:55.357 --> 01:56.759
Little fight broke out.

01:58.694 --> 02:02.064
<i>Before I knew it, Mick jumped
in, pulled the guy off me,</i>

02:02.098 --> 02:03.866
<i>but the guy
had friends with him.</i>

02:03.900 --> 02:06.836
<i>I tried to help, but...
Fuck.</i>

02:06.869 --> 02:09.670
<i>Mick had it under control.</i>

02:09.705 --> 02:11.741
<i>He wiped the floor
with all of them.</i>

02:13.375 --> 02:15.812
<i>Crazy thing was,
he never threw a punch.</i>

02:23.753 --> 02:25.988
And that was it.

02:26.022 --> 02:27.690
It was over.

02:28.724 --> 02:29.926
<i>I thanked him.</i>

02:29.959 --> 02:31.694
And afterwards, I went around,

02:31.727 --> 02:35.698
got his piece of shit car,
brought it to him.

02:35.731 --> 02:38.067
And then that dude,
he looked me right in the eye,

02:38.100 --> 02:41.469
and he said,
"Thanks a lot, Taco."

02:43.840 --> 02:45.975
Now I saw
what this guy could do,

02:46.008 --> 02:47.810
but I just had
to fuckin' ask him...

02:47.844 --> 02:50.112
"What did you just call me?"

02:50.146 --> 02:53.582
And I think he was a little
surprised by my tone, but he said,

02:53.615 --> 02:55.718
"Hey, sorry, man.

02:55.751 --> 02:57.954
I thought them
was your friends

02:57.987 --> 03:00.156
and they was
calling you Taco."

03:04.593 --> 03:07.029
After that, he just broke
out into the biggest grin...

03:11.734 --> 03:13.736
and he became the best
friend I ever had.

03:16.005 --> 03:19.608
Was Mickey Kelley really
that amazing of a fighter?

03:22.144 --> 03:25.480
People seem to think that
the Holy Grail of MMA videos

03:25.513 --> 03:28.050
is the Rickson Gracie
versus Yoji Anjo fight.

03:29.451 --> 03:31.386
But it's not.

03:32.621 --> 03:34.489
It's Kelley versus Blaine.

03:36.058 --> 03:37.927
And people think
that it didn't happen?

03:37.960 --> 03:40.129
That just makes me laugh.

03:41.898 --> 03:43.165
'Cause I was there.

03:47.904 --> 03:49.906
<i>It all happened
back in the early '90s,</i>

03:49.939 --> 03:51.908
<i>before the sport
even had a name.</i>

03:51.941 --> 03:53.508
- Yeah.
- Water?

03:53.541 --> 03:55.443
- Thank you
- You are welcome.

03:55.477 --> 03:57.046
Did you see this article?

03:58.580 --> 04:00.983
I'm thinking maybe
a pink one or a blue.

04:01.017 --> 04:02.885
Here's your water.

04:02.919 --> 04:05.187
So when we got
to the airport,

04:05.221 --> 04:08.024
- they told us our flight was overbooked.
- Thank you.

04:08.057 --> 04:11.193
Which left only one open seat
in first class.

04:11.227 --> 04:13.896
And I wanted my husband
to have that,

04:13.930 --> 04:16.798
'cause it supports his back
a lot better.

04:16.832 --> 04:19.067
Well, I just had to ask,
'cause for a minute there

04:19.101 --> 04:21.103
I thought he was upset
'cause I was bad company.

04:21.137 --> 04:25.007
No,
and it may seem very silly,

04:25.041 --> 04:28.010
but I miss him.

04:28.044 --> 04:31.013
We're on our way to Dubai to celebrate
our 50th wedding anniversary.

04:31.047 --> 04:33.481
- That's where we met.
- Oh, wow.

04:33.515 --> 04:36.185
Wow, 50 years.
Congratulations.

04:36.218 --> 04:38.854
Since our last child
left for college,

04:38.888 --> 04:42.158
we haven't been apart more than
four or five hours at a time.

04:42.191 --> 04:44.559
Wow.

04:44.592 --> 04:47.562
Maybe the person sitting next to
him would swap chairs with you.

04:48.898 --> 04:50.099
Excuse me.

04:57.106 --> 04:59.241
Pardon, sir.
Do you happen to know

04:59.275 --> 05:01.177
who's seated in the chair
next to you?

05:01.210 --> 05:03.112
A real nice young lady

05:03.145 --> 05:04.981
and she's heading
back that way.

05:05.014 --> 05:06.048
Is that right?

05:06.082 --> 05:08.217
I appreciate it, sir.
Thank you.

05:12.554 --> 05:14.890
- Hi.
- Hi.

05:14.924 --> 05:16.624
I, uh...

05:16.658 --> 05:19.161
Shit, um...

05:19.195 --> 05:21.097
You're
in seat 5F, right?

05:21.130 --> 05:22.597
Yeah.

05:22.630 --> 05:24.233
Look, I know it's...
I know it's a long shot,

05:24.266 --> 05:26.969
but any possibility
you'd be willing to trade...

05:27.003 --> 05:30.206
Relax. I already told Mrs.
Miller I'd give her my seat.

05:40.648 --> 05:42.650
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

05:42.685 --> 05:44.720
<i>we will be serving dinner...</i>

05:44.754 --> 05:46.789
So, uh, you, uh...

05:46.822 --> 05:48.924
You gals in some sort of
beauty pageant or something?

05:48.958 --> 05:50.926
No, no.
We're, uh...

05:50.960 --> 05:52.695
We're doing
this modeling shoot

05:52.728 --> 05:54.596
for this new fur company
in Dubai.

05:54.629 --> 05:56.766
You're a fashion model.

05:56.799 --> 05:58.901
No, well, it's my...
It's my first time.

05:58.934 --> 06:00.770
The, uh...
the law office I work in,

06:00.803 --> 06:02.738
they represent
this modeling agent

06:02.772 --> 06:04.740
and he was nice enough
to give me the opportunity.

06:04.774 --> 06:05.941
- Oh, okay.
- Mm-hmm.

06:07.843 --> 06:09.945
So you... you a lawyer?

06:09.979 --> 06:11.747
I'm a paralegal,
actually,

06:11.781 --> 06:15.017
but it's kinda just like
a backup plan.

06:15.051 --> 06:16.886
- A backup plan.
- Mm-hmm.

06:16.919 --> 06:19.822
So what's the...
what's the main plan then?

06:20.823 --> 06:23.726
To be a stay-at-home mom.

06:23.759 --> 06:26.195
Well, once I meet my
husband, of course.

06:28.731 --> 06:30.733
What? Why are you
looking at me like that?

06:30.766 --> 06:31.967
No, no, you just...

06:32.001 --> 06:33.936
you just don't
hear that every day.

06:33.969 --> 06:37.239
That sounds good.

06:37.273 --> 06:39.141
So what about you?

06:39.175 --> 06:40.376
What brings you to Dubai?

06:40.409 --> 06:42.745
I'm-I'm...
I'm just going to teach.

06:42.778 --> 06:43.946
Teach what?

06:43.979 --> 06:46.648
Uh, combatives.
It's like martial arts.

06:46.682 --> 06:48.350
Specifically, the martial art's
called jiu-jitsu.

06:48.384 --> 06:51.387
It's-it's
a Brazilian variation.

06:51.420 --> 06:53.322
Is it like karate?

06:53.355 --> 06:55.091
No, ma'am,
it's nothing like karate.

06:55.124 --> 06:57.893
It's... Uh, to the layman
it would look like, uh...

06:57.927 --> 06:59.695
- Olympic wrestling.
- Uh-huh.

06:59.728 --> 07:01.397
The only difference being,
you get your opponent

07:01.430 --> 07:03.365
to concede either
physically or verbally

07:03.399 --> 07:06.601
by chokes, joint locks,
bone manipulation, stuff like that.

07:07.837 --> 07:09.205
God, it sounds horrible.

07:09.238 --> 07:11.874
No. No, no, no,
it's not-not horrible.

07:11.907 --> 07:14.110
It's easy. I mean,
if something goes wrong,

07:14.143 --> 07:16.145
- they tap and the match is over.
- Yeah.

07:16.178 --> 07:19.281
- It's relatively safe. It's not...
- Really? It's safe?

07:19.315 --> 07:22.251
Well, what...
What happened to your eye, then?

07:22.284 --> 07:24.386
Okay, well,
that-that was an accident.

07:24.420 --> 07:26.922
I mean, that... Normally,
things like that don't happen.

07:26.956 --> 07:30.326
So you teach
real fighting, huh?

07:30.359 --> 07:31.327
Yes, ma'am.

07:31.360 --> 07:33.996
You know, I gotta say, I...

07:34.029 --> 07:37.032
I do not like fighting.
I don't like watching it.

07:37.066 --> 07:39.068
When I was a kid, my, uh...

07:39.101 --> 07:41.036
my cousin got into it
with this other boy,

07:41.070 --> 07:45.007
and both ended up all bloody
and it was awful.

07:45.040 --> 07:46.641
I'll never forget it.

07:49.745 --> 07:51.247
Well, if it makes you
feel any better,

07:51.280 --> 07:56.118
I-I don't train to start fights,
just end them if I need to.

07:58.220 --> 08:00.890
I guess that makes me feel
a little bit better, yeah.

08:01.891 --> 08:04.093
Well, good. Good.

08:05.494 --> 08:07.163
I'm Mickey, by the way.

08:07.196 --> 08:09.331
- Layla.
- Layla.

08:09.365 --> 08:11.100
It's very nice
to meet you, Layla.

08:11.133 --> 08:12.667
It's nice
to meet you too.

08:36.491 --> 08:39.227
Oh, my God.
Did I drool on you?

08:39.260 --> 08:40.361
I'm so sorry.

08:40.395 --> 08:43.065
It's... It's okay.
It's okay.

08:43.097 --> 08:45.467
I didn't have the heart
to wake you up, so...

08:46.936 --> 08:49.238
Oh, my God.
Did we land already?

08:49.271 --> 08:50.839
We did, yeah.

08:50.873 --> 08:52.508
I need to... I need
to get back with the group.

08:52.541 --> 08:54.410
There's a shuttle
picking us up.

08:54.443 --> 08:57.880
I'm at the, uh, Scorpione Hotel.
Layla Boudreau.

08:57.913 --> 09:00.950
- Look me up.
- I will.

09:00.983 --> 09:02.885
Shit.

09:02.918 --> 09:06.722
Write it down.
Don't screw this up, son.

09:11.026 --> 09:12.528
Welcome.

09:12.561 --> 09:14.263
First of all,
I'd like to thank you all

09:14.296 --> 09:15.531
for joining me here today.

09:15.564 --> 09:18.133
And a really big thanks

09:18.167 --> 09:21.303
to Amin's father
for facilitating this lesson.

09:21.337 --> 09:25.374
He flew me out all the way from
the United States of America

09:25.407 --> 09:27.843
to talk about something
I am very passionate about.

09:27.876 --> 09:30.312
Maybe that passion
will become contagious,

09:30.346 --> 09:33.782
and you all will adopt it
into your lives as I have mine.

09:33.816 --> 09:37.987
I had the opportunity to learn Brazilian
jiu-jitsu straight from the source,

09:38.020 --> 09:41.257
so I will do my best
to pay homage to my sensei,

09:41.290 --> 09:43.425
Professor Renzo Gracie.

09:43.459 --> 09:45.294
So let's get started.

09:45.327 --> 09:47.363
So I will need a volunteer.

09:47.396 --> 09:49.031
Who wants to help me out?

09:49.064 --> 09:51.433
Amin, please,
join me up front.

09:53.435 --> 09:55.304
I really appreciate
the opportunity, sir,

09:55.337 --> 09:56.405
so thank you.
Thank you very much.

09:56.438 --> 09:58.007
Thank my son.

09:58.040 --> 09:59.508
He is the one
who introducing me

09:59.541 --> 10:01.977
to this Brazilian jiu-jitsu.

10:02.011 --> 10:03.979
Well, he is
an excellent student.

10:04.013 --> 10:05.314
Very eager to learn,
as well.

10:05.347 --> 10:06.982
He's eager to learn
to defend himself

10:07.016 --> 10:08.250
against his big cousin.

10:08.284 --> 10:09.985
Right.

10:10.019 --> 10:12.121
Mr. Kelley, tell me,
if you are as good

10:12.154 --> 10:13.055
as he says you are,

10:13.088 --> 10:14.857
why do you not fight?

10:16.025 --> 10:17.459
Well, there's plenty
of times in life

10:17.493 --> 10:19.028
when you're forced
to fight as it is.

10:19.061 --> 10:20.829
You know, I do my best

10:20.863 --> 10:23.299
to not supplement
that number, you know.

10:23.332 --> 10:25.534
Then why do it at all?

10:26.535 --> 10:28.237
It's helped me.

10:28.270 --> 10:29.972
Changed me, even.

10:30.005 --> 10:34.243
Been a... sort of medicine
for me in a lot of ways.

10:34.276 --> 10:37.112
- I see.
- Plus, I think everybody needs

10:37.146 --> 10:40.883
a little meritocracy
in their lives.

10:40.916 --> 10:42.951
And a jiu-jitsu match
is just that, you know.

10:42.985 --> 10:46.088
Once you clap hands and go,
there's no hiding.

10:46.121 --> 10:48.924
That mat is gonna
expose every lie

10:48.957 --> 10:51.360
and confirm every truth
with each roll.

10:52.628 --> 10:54.296
It truly holds
a mirror up to you,

10:54.330 --> 10:57.132
right in your face,
every single day.

10:57.166 --> 10:59.101
And I love that about it.

11:01.937 --> 11:05.007
Um, I'm sorry, sir.

11:05.040 --> 11:06.909
I just recognize
a friend of mine.

11:06.942 --> 11:09.311
Would you... Could I just
briefly go say hello?

11:09.345 --> 11:10.579
Of course, please.

11:10.612 --> 11:12.381
Be right back, sir.

11:14.049 --> 11:15.184
Layla.

11:15.217 --> 11:18.287
- Hey.
- Mickey. Hi.

11:18.320 --> 11:21.090
Hi, it's, um...

11:21.123 --> 11:23.425
It's good to see
a friendly face.

11:23.459 --> 11:24.593
Yeah, I, uh...

11:24.626 --> 11:25.661
I looked for you
at the hotel,

11:25.695 --> 11:27.296
but they didn't
have your name.

11:27.329 --> 11:30.232
Yeah, um, they put all of us
under the host's name.

11:30.265 --> 11:33.202
He's some Greek fur magnet,

11:33.235 --> 11:35.137
I don't even... I can't even
pronounce his name.

11:35.170 --> 11:36.305
Is everything okay?

11:36.338 --> 11:37.306
- 'Cause you seem upset.
- Well...

11:37.339 --> 11:38.474
Miss Layla.

11:40.109 --> 11:42.344
You must return to the table
and apologize right away.

11:42.378 --> 11:43.912
- He deserved it.
- Miss Layla, in Dubai,

11:43.946 --> 11:46.281
a woman does not touch
a man, let alone strike him.

11:46.315 --> 11:48.317
But he's allowed to
touch me all he wants

11:48.350 --> 11:50.285
- wherever he wants?
- You misunderstand the customs here.

11:50.319 --> 11:52.221
You've caused him
tremendous embarrassment.

11:52.254 --> 11:54.256
I don't care if he's
embarrassed, he deserves it.

11:54.289 --> 11:57.526
If Mr. Kostopoulos wants to
discuss modelling work over drinks,

11:57.559 --> 11:59.027
then you must oblige.

11:59.061 --> 12:01.196
Please, return
to the table right now,

12:01.230 --> 12:02.664
or you'll be
in breach of contract.

12:02.699 --> 12:05.267
Listen, buddy, I'm sure
we can work something out here.

12:06.736 --> 12:08.537
Who are you, sir?

12:10.672 --> 12:12.441
Just a friend
of hers. Why?

12:12.474 --> 12:14.476
What do you do in Dubai?

12:15.477 --> 12:17.246
Work for Sheikh Bin Khalid.

12:17.279 --> 12:20.382
Ah, you're employee
of His Highness.

12:20.416 --> 12:22.050
What do you do?

12:22.084 --> 12:25.220
Kitchen supervisor?
Dog walker?

12:25.254 --> 12:26.422
Secretary?

12:26.455 --> 12:28.157
No, sir.

12:28.190 --> 12:30.392
I teach jiu-jitsu.

12:30.426 --> 12:32.628
Ah, yes.

12:32.661 --> 12:34.697
Alvah here,
he doesn't like jiu-jitsu.

12:34.731 --> 12:38.033
Why do you not like it?
I forget.

12:38.066 --> 12:41.003
It's for, uh,
how you say?

12:41.036 --> 12:42.237
Faggots.

12:47.309 --> 12:49.044
Look, Mickey,

12:49.077 --> 12:51.447
don't worry about me,
I'll-I'll take care of it.

12:51.480 --> 12:53.282
I-I don't want to cause you
any trouble, okay?

12:53.315 --> 12:56.585
Yes, Mr. Mickey,
please go.

12:56.618 --> 13:00.456
Allow me to have a
conversation with my employee.

13:03.459 --> 13:06.662
Do you wanna talk
to this guy?

13:06.696 --> 13:08.030
I'll be fine.

13:10.566 --> 13:12.434
I'll be sitting
right over there.

13:15.637 --> 13:18.173
Layla, please,
come and sit.

13:18.207 --> 13:19.575
We must have a discussion.

13:24.046 --> 13:26.348
So I see you met
Dimitris Kostopoulos.

13:27.784 --> 13:30.720
My cousin helped him start
a tiny fur market.

13:30.753 --> 13:33.655
Now he basically runs
the entire trade.

13:33.690 --> 13:37.292
One of the wealthiest
non-Emiratis in the city.

13:37.326 --> 13:38.695
Do you know the girl?

13:38.728 --> 13:43.365
Yes, sir. I-I just met her
on the flight over, but...

13:43.398 --> 13:44.801
She's a prostitute.

13:44.834 --> 13:47.704
- No, sir. All due respect...
- It is the truth.

13:47.737 --> 13:50.072
Dimitris likes to hire
beautiful Western women

13:50.105 --> 13:55.110
and pay them $50,000 to come here and
model for his private line of fur.

13:55.143 --> 13:57.680
And when they get here,
they are encouraged to do more,

13:57.714 --> 13:59.248
and they always say yes.

14:00.850 --> 14:02.551
You see
his bodyguard, Alvah?

14:04.152 --> 14:05.822
Ex-Spetsnaz.

14:05.855 --> 14:10.727
Also an Israeli martial arts
expert in, um... Krav Magoo.

14:10.760 --> 14:12.661
It's Krav Maga, sir.

14:12.695 --> 14:16.733
- Excuse me?
- It's-it's... Krav Maga.

14:16.766 --> 14:21.036
Dimitris says he has killed
eight people with his bare hands.

14:22.371 --> 14:24.373
Would you pardon me
one more time, sir?

14:24.406 --> 14:25.775
Excuse me.

14:31.748 --> 14:33.482
So here's
how it goes.

14:33.515 --> 14:36.418
If you do not apologize
to Mr. Kostopoulos

14:36.451 --> 14:38.353
and spend a little time
with him,

14:38.387 --> 14:40.322
we will de-fund
your return ticket

14:40.355 --> 14:42.658
and you can find your own way
back to the United States.

14:42.692 --> 14:44.861
You know, sir,

14:44.894 --> 14:48.263
I can't help but feel like you
might have been trying to insult me

14:48.297 --> 14:51.466
with the stuff about the dog
walker and the kitchen supervisor.

14:51.500 --> 14:53.535
Or did I take that
the wrong way?

14:53.569 --> 14:56.371
'Cause if you want to insult me,
just have the courage to do it, sir.

14:56.405 --> 14:58.507
Don't hide it behind words that
could be taken more than one way.

14:58.540 --> 14:59.776
Look, I don't know
who the hell

14:59.809 --> 15:01.176
- you think are you are...
- Stelios.

15:02.277 --> 15:04.146
Do you know who I am?

15:04.179 --> 15:06.716
No, sir, I don't.

15:06.749 --> 15:09.651
I just know
I don't like you very much.

15:09.686 --> 15:12.588
Layla, would you
like to leave?

15:14.423 --> 15:16.726
You're making me very upset,

15:16.759 --> 15:20.228
and when I get upset,
Alvah gets very mad,

15:20.262 --> 15:22.297
and he will be here
any second.

15:22.331 --> 15:25.534
No, sir. I don't think
he's coming back.

15:27.603 --> 15:28.871
Call a doctor, quickly!

15:35.945 --> 15:38.413
<i>Salaam
aleikum,</i> Mr. Kostopoulos.

15:39.615 --> 15:41.550
Is my friend
troubling you?

15:41.583 --> 15:43.151
No.

15:44.653 --> 15:46.756
I think it's time
we go, Mickey, no?

15:46.789 --> 15:49.358
Please, give me a moment
and I will meet you in front.

15:49.391 --> 15:50.525
Yes, sir.

15:56.465 --> 15:59.301
Now, I could not hear
what you were saying,

15:59.334 --> 16:02.604
but I do recognize
that look.

16:02.638 --> 16:04.606
So let me tell you this.

16:04.640 --> 16:07.309
Mr. Kelley is my friend.

16:07.342 --> 16:09.478
And I know you're a friend
of my cousin,

16:09.511 --> 16:10.512
but he has many.

16:11.513 --> 16:12.514
I do not.

16:13.750 --> 16:17.352
You are a guest here.
Don't forget that.

16:26.361 --> 16:28.664
Your Excellency,
please believe me when I tell you,

16:28.698 --> 16:30.499
I meant no disrespect
to you here in your home...

16:30.532 --> 16:31.633
Stop it, Mickey.

16:31.667 --> 16:33.703
I insist you stay here
one more week

16:33.736 --> 16:36.271
and teach me
Brazilian jiu-jitsu.

16:37.606 --> 16:40.442
I'd-I'd be happy
to get you started, sir.

16:40.475 --> 16:41.744
I'm flattered, actually.

16:41.778 --> 16:45.280
But could you possibly do me
one huge favor?

16:45.313 --> 16:47.416
Could you get her
the first flight home?

16:47.449 --> 16:48.885
Done.

17:27.957 --> 17:28.991
Hello.

17:29.992 --> 17:31.460
Hey, good afternoon.

17:33.628 --> 17:35.898
Are you friend
of Mickey Kelley?

17:37.365 --> 17:38.701
Maybe.

17:38.735 --> 17:40.268
Who's asking?

17:41.369 --> 17:42.939
I'm Layla.

17:42.972 --> 17:45.440
I met him
a few weeks ago in Dubai.

17:45.474 --> 17:47.309
I was hoping I could
get a hold of him,

17:47.342 --> 17:48.945
but I didn't...
I didn't get his number.

17:48.978 --> 17:52.614
But he, um...
He mentioned this shop.

17:52.647 --> 17:54.516
And he...
and he told me about you.

17:54.549 --> 17:56.485
Told you about who,
specifically?

17:56.518 --> 17:59.689
You. You know, he said that
you were his-his best friend.

17:59.722 --> 18:01.490
He give you a name?

18:04.093 --> 18:09.832
Okay, um, this is what
he said it was: Taco?

18:11.600 --> 18:13.970
Oh, my God. I am...
I am... I'm so sorry.

18:14.003 --> 18:15.570
I shouldn't...
I shouldn't have come here.

18:15.604 --> 18:16.873
Hey, I'm just kidding.

18:16.906 --> 18:18.573
I'm totally just kidding.
I'm Taco.

18:18.607 --> 18:20.009
- Oh.
- Yeah.

18:20.042 --> 18:22.011
He called me yesterday.
He sounded jet-lagged.

18:22.044 --> 18:23.378
He was supposed
to be here an hour ago,

18:23.411 --> 18:25.081
but he hasn't shown up yet.

18:25.114 --> 18:26.716
Oh.

18:26.749 --> 18:28.583
Did he mention me?

18:29.584 --> 18:31.319
Uh... no.

18:31.353 --> 18:32.955
Yeah, okay.

18:32.989 --> 18:36.458
I, um... I gave him
my number, but I guess...

18:36.491 --> 18:38.795
I guess I shouldn't have
assumed that he...

18:38.828 --> 18:40.930
Don't tell him
I came here, okay?

18:40.963 --> 18:43.665
I'm-I'm feeling a little bit
embarrassed by all of this.

18:43.699 --> 18:45.067
There he is.
Now he shows up.

18:47.003 --> 18:49.671
Oh, my God, now he's gonna think
I'm some stalker, or something.

18:49.705 --> 18:52.842
What... No, what...
What's going on?

18:52.875 --> 18:54.744
If he wanted to talk to me,
he would've called.

18:54.777 --> 18:56.545
I think I just misread
all of it.

18:56.578 --> 18:58.513
- Please, just don't tell him I'm here.
- Taco?

18:58.547 --> 18:59.882
- Please.
- Hold on.

18:59.916 --> 19:01.616
- Hey, bud.
- Hey.

19:01.650 --> 19:02.785
Good of you
to finally join me.

19:02.819 --> 19:06.354
Sorry I'm late, man.
I-I overslept.

19:06.388 --> 19:08.090
I'm still pretty...
pretty jet-lagged

19:08.124 --> 19:09.859
- from the trip, you know.
- How was it?

19:11.861 --> 19:13.062
I met a girl.

19:13.095 --> 19:14.529
An Arab chick?

19:14.563 --> 19:16.598
No, no, no, she's-she's
from North Carolina.

19:16.631 --> 19:18.067
- She's...
- Okay, white girl.

19:18.100 --> 19:20.602
Yeah, she's fucking
beautiful, man.

19:20.635 --> 19:23.505
And, uh... I-I got
her phone number.

19:23.538 --> 19:24.941
You know,
she wrote it down

19:24.974 --> 19:26.843
and it-it was on the nightstand
right in the hotel,

19:26.876 --> 19:29.712
and I looked at it every night
before I went to bed.

19:29.745 --> 19:31.814
And then the night before
my flight to come home,

19:31.848 --> 19:35.417
it's gone, you know.
But I told her about you.

19:35.450 --> 19:37.119
- Is that right?
- Yeah, I told her about the shop.

19:37.153 --> 19:39.554
- Hmm.
- But, I mean...

19:39.588 --> 19:42.624
Fuck, she's probably... She's probably
waiting for me to call, you know.

19:42.657 --> 19:45.393
- Yeah, maybe.
- You know, Taco, I've never believed

19:45.427 --> 19:49.664
in that "love at first sight" crap
they talk about in the movies.

19:49.699 --> 19:53.002
It's like you say about music,
that it's in the bottom end.

19:53.035 --> 19:55.604
- Yeah.
- Brother, she fell asleep

19:55.637 --> 19:57.773
with her head on my chest
for five hours,

19:57.807 --> 20:00.710
and I couldn't move,
but I felt her heart, brother.

20:00.743 --> 20:02.078
And it's strong, man.

20:02.111 --> 20:03.713
It's got that bass
you talk about like...

20:03.746 --> 20:05.580
Easy, bro.

20:05.614 --> 20:08.084
You sound like an infatuated
little bitch right now.

20:08.117 --> 20:09.986
Any chick hears you
talking like that,

20:10.019 --> 20:11.754
they're gonna totally
fuckin' own your ass.

20:11.787 --> 20:14.123
Taco, I would marry
this girl.

20:14.156 --> 20:16.025
- Hey...
- I would marry her, I swear to God,

20:16.058 --> 20:18.593
and I knew it after
knowing her ten minutes.

20:18.627 --> 20:21.097
You know, you hear people
talk about "the one."

20:21.130 --> 20:22.631
- Okay...
- She's mine.

20:22.664 --> 20:24.532
Let's go eat, man.
I'm fucking starving.

20:24.566 --> 20:26.135
You're not even
listening to me.

20:26.168 --> 20:28.704
Totally am, bro.
Let me just get my wallet.

20:28.738 --> 20:30.940
- Whoa, sorry about that.
- I'll be in the car.

20:30.973 --> 20:33.743
I was not expecting him
to be such a... sissy about it.

20:35.510 --> 20:38.681
Hey. You okay?

20:40.515 --> 20:42.550
Yeah. Yeah.

20:42.584 --> 20:43.652
I, um...

20:44.653 --> 20:46.122
I never, um...

20:46.155 --> 20:48.824
I've never heard anyone
say about me

20:48.858 --> 20:50.960
exactly what I feel
about them, you know?

20:52.494 --> 20:53.963
<i>She left her number,</i>

20:53.996 --> 20:55.698
<i>and I gave it to him
the next day.</i>

21:04.206 --> 21:05.174
Hey.

21:18.087 --> 21:19.855
I thought I may have
missed you or something...

21:19.889 --> 21:21.824
<i>That was it.</i>

21:21.857 --> 21:24.760
<i>Those two were fucking
inseparable after that.</i>

21:27.063 --> 21:29.832
<i>Layla got a job
as a paralegal.</i>

21:29.865 --> 21:31.533
Excuse me,
guys. Pardon.

21:31.566 --> 21:34.003
<i>Mickey continued bouncing
at this local bar</i>

21:34.036 --> 21:35.938
<i>and training when he could.</i>

21:35.972 --> 21:38.808
<i>There weren't any standalone
jiu-jitsu schools back then,</i>

21:38.841 --> 21:41.978
<i>so Mick and some other guys just
rented some space at a McDojo.</i>

21:42.011 --> 21:43.980
- <i>McDojo?</i>
- <i>Yeah, like, you know,</i>

21:44.013 --> 21:46.514
<i>some other places you go to
and order chicken nuggets,</i>

21:46.548 --> 21:48.084
<i>and you get that real chicken,</i>

21:48.117 --> 21:51.087
<i>but then you go to Mickey D's,
and what you're gettin'</i>

21:51.120 --> 21:53.756
- <i>isn't even real.</i>
- <i>I get it.</i>

22:00.029 --> 22:03.132
<i>I married them myself,</i>

22:03.165 --> 22:04.700
<i>in bay number two of my shop.</i>

22:04.734 --> 22:08.004
So now, by the power
vested in me,

22:08.037 --> 22:10.039
in the name
of Jesus Christ,

22:10.072 --> 22:12.574
I pronounce you
husband and wife.

22:12.607 --> 22:14.509
- You may kiss the bride.
- Okay.

22:29.657 --> 22:31.227
<i>It was just us.</i>

22:31.260 --> 22:33.095
- <i>Neither of them had...</i>
- Thank you!

22:33.129 --> 22:35.131
<i>...any real family
to speak of.</i>

22:35.164 --> 22:37.833
I did the interior
for you guys.

22:43.072 --> 22:44.940
I have
a surprise for you.

22:44.974 --> 22:46.574
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

22:46.608 --> 22:47.609
What?

22:47.642 --> 22:48.844
Close your eyes.

22:48.878 --> 22:51.680
Okay.

22:51.714 --> 22:53.015
Hold out your hand.

22:53.049 --> 22:55.751
- Okay, why...
- Keep your eyes closed.

22:55.785 --> 22:57.987
- Keep your eyes closed.
- Okay, okay, okay, okay.

23:09.298 --> 23:10.699
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

23:19.742 --> 23:21.911
You know, I never really
knew what I wanted.

23:23.345 --> 23:24.646
But I do now.

23:26.115 --> 23:29.251
I want my son to have
all the stuff I never had.

23:29.285 --> 23:32.254
And I wanna start by making
sure he's got a godfather.

23:39.261 --> 23:43.199
- Me?
- Of course you, man.

23:43.232 --> 23:45.600
Come on, you're the best
friend I got on the planet.

23:47.169 --> 23:49.071
<i>Mickey'd been through
the foster system,</i>

23:49.105 --> 23:52.842
<i>so he wanted to be sure there
was no chance</i>

23:52.875 --> 23:55.144
<i>of that ever happening to his kid.</i>

23:57.313 --> 23:58.247
Hello?

23:58.280 --> 23:59.949
<i>Few months later,</i>

23:59.982 --> 24:01.984
<i>he gets a call
from his friend in Dubai</i>

24:02.017 --> 24:04.720
<i>after he'd seen
an early UFC event.</i>

24:04.753 --> 24:06.055
It's great to hear from you.

24:06.088 --> 24:07.323
Who is it?

24:07.356 --> 24:09.892
But this isn't
just grappling, right?

24:09.925 --> 24:13.062
This is like a-a real dangerous
fight, like on TV?

24:14.897 --> 24:18.100
Well, yeah, I mean,
it's-it's no holds barred.

24:18.134 --> 24:19.768
I just... I don't understand,
like, why...

24:19.802 --> 24:22.138
why did you never
fight in one of those before?

24:22.171 --> 24:25.441
Honey, I've never really
had a reason, you know?

24:25.474 --> 24:27.977
But this is 25 grand
just to show up.

24:28.010 --> 24:31.046
And that's a downpayment
on a house for us.

24:31.080 --> 24:33.716
And it's another 75 grand
if I win.

24:33.749 --> 24:36.819
Babe, I don't...
I don't know if I...

24:36.852 --> 24:40.055
Babe... I can win.

24:41.390 --> 24:43.325
<i>Mickey'd
been offered to compete</i>

24:43.359 --> 24:47.029
<i>in an eight-man tournament
along with Marco Blaine.</i>

24:50.766 --> 24:54.170
<i>Marco was a top contender for
the</i> Vale Tudo <i>Championship belt</i>

24:54.203 --> 24:56.839
<i>and one of the best strikers
in the world.</i>

25:11.820 --> 25:16.058
<i>Mickey was just a prodigy
in ground fighting.</i>

25:16.091 --> 25:19.461
<i>I'd never seen him tap, and he rolled
with some of the best in the business,</i>

25:19.495 --> 25:22.831
<i>like Pitt. That dude was
in the fucking Olympics.</i>

25:22.865 --> 25:24.800
You all right?

25:24.833 --> 25:27.937
Uh, but this fight
wasn't gonna be on TV.

25:27.970 --> 25:29.405
Now, if you remember
back in those days,

25:29.438 --> 25:32.107
most states had banned
MMA fights,

25:32.141 --> 25:34.009
<i>because, uh, John McCain
and some other senators,</i>

25:34.043 --> 25:37.012
<i>they thought
it was too violent.</i>

25:37.046 --> 25:39.281
<i>Matter of fact, one of the first
American promoters, Dick Mason,</i>

25:39.315 --> 25:41.383
<i>he went and testified
in Washington.</i>

25:45.955 --> 25:48.290
You're wasting your time
testifying.

25:48.324 --> 25:51.060
Can't even call
that crap a sport.

25:51.093 --> 25:53.195
The world's already got
real athletes.

25:55.231 --> 25:59.268
Mankind's always been intrigued
with finding its best athletes.

25:59.301 --> 26:02.037
We're a competitive species.

26:02.071 --> 26:05.207
Hell, we've even
invented games

26:05.241 --> 26:08.244
to try and measure a man.

26:08.277 --> 26:12.381
McGwire and Sosa can park more
balls over a center field fence

26:12.414 --> 26:14.083
than the rest of the planet.

26:14.116 --> 26:17.019
Shaq can slam dunk
over almost anybody's head.

26:17.052 --> 26:22.524
Hm. Mike Tyson can touch anybody's nose
without them even seeing him flinch.

26:24.126 --> 26:27.263
Impressive, all of them.

26:27.296 --> 26:32.368
But, uh, make no mistake.

26:32.401 --> 26:34.303
Outside of the rule
of law...

26:35.871 --> 26:38.807
they'd all be doing
my athlete's laundry.

26:38.841 --> 26:42.278
In this sport,
there's no headgear, no gloves,

26:42.311 --> 26:45.481
it's bare knuckles
on the side of your head.

26:45.514 --> 26:47.883
The gloves are only there
to protect the hands,

26:47.916 --> 26:51.553
and, in fact, only ensure
that the punching continues.

26:51.587 --> 26:54.423
And as far as headgear,
although it prevents cuts,

26:54.456 --> 26:57.059
the downside of that
is that it does allow

26:57.092 --> 26:59.261
for repeated concussion
to the brain.

26:59.295 --> 27:02.431
<i>Sanctioning MMA fights
was kinda like...</i>

27:02.464 --> 27:04.833
<i>It had us back up against a brick
wall, but, you know,</i>

27:04.867 --> 27:06.568
<i>once that Pandora's Box
was open...</i>

27:09.238 --> 27:10.906
<i>people were hungry for it.</i>

27:15.210 --> 27:17.246
<i>So these rich Arab guys
started putting on</i>

27:17.279 --> 27:20.949
<i>their own tournaments
in the desert, gladiator-style.</i>

27:20.983 --> 27:24.987
<i>Literally just saying,
"I wanna see this guy and this guy fight,"</i>

27:25.020 --> 27:26.989
<i>offering them money,
flying them out.</i>

27:36.565 --> 27:39.201
<i>We all flew out to Dubai
for an event and I...</i>

27:39.234 --> 27:43.539
<i>I was to be in the corner
with my best friend.</i>

27:43.572 --> 27:45.407
Breathe in for me.

27:45.441 --> 27:48.043
Breathe out.

27:48.077 --> 27:49.611
<i>He was more than ready,</i>

27:49.645 --> 27:51.580
<i>and there wasn't
any doubt in my mind</i>

27:51.613 --> 27:53.349
<i>that if he got to fight Blaine</i>

27:53.382 --> 27:55.351
<i>and he could get him
to the ground,</i>

27:55.384 --> 27:57.186
<i>that he'd completely
annihilate him.</i>

28:02.424 --> 28:04.326
All is good.

28:04.360 --> 28:07.029
- Okay, thank you very much, Doctor.
- You're welcome.

28:15.037 --> 28:17.306
Hey, Doc.

28:17.339 --> 28:19.174
I saw you
make a face just now.

28:19.208 --> 28:21.643
Why'd you make a face?

28:21.678 --> 28:24.179
There are eight men
in this tournament.

28:24.213 --> 28:28.183
Seven of them have
a resting heart rate of 85.

28:29.551 --> 28:33.222
One of them
has a rate of 42.

28:34.556 --> 28:37.493
Your friend
is either very confident...

28:37.526 --> 28:39.928
or very naive.

28:39.962 --> 28:43.565
<i>And the winner, Marco Blaine.</i>

28:48.303 --> 28:52.408
Next, we have Mickey
Kelley, from the United States.

28:57.246 --> 29:00.949
And Tadashi Yamamoto,
from Japan.

29:06.455 --> 29:09.057
Gentlemen, you may begin.

29:32.080 --> 29:33.750
There you go!

29:33.783 --> 29:35.384
That's right, hang on!

29:38.053 --> 29:41.089
And our winner,
by submission,

29:41.123 --> 29:45.327
at 54 seconds,
Mickey Kelley!

29:51.567 --> 29:54.503
For the first match
of our semi-finals,

29:54.536 --> 29:57.506
we have Mickey Kelley,
from the United States.

29:59.809 --> 30:02.411
And Razak, from Nigeria.

30:05.180 --> 30:07.616
Gentlemen, begin.

30:19.628 --> 30:21.396
Nice.

30:25.400 --> 30:27.236
There you go.

30:27.269 --> 30:28.270
Bring him down.
Bring him down.

30:32.140 --> 30:33.776
There you go!

30:37.346 --> 30:39.414
Let's go!

30:39.448 --> 30:44.253
The winner, by submission, Mickey Kelley!

30:44.286 --> 30:47.623
<i>Everyone was hoping it would
come down to Marco and Mickey.</i>

30:47.656 --> 30:49.658
<i>And they got their wish.</i>

30:49.692 --> 30:51.660
<i>After Mickey's
first two fights,</i>

30:51.694 --> 30:53.595
<i>Mickey was
heavily favored to win,</i>

30:53.629 --> 30:55.397
<i>and not just by me.</i>

31:03.105 --> 31:07.175
For our main event, we have Mickey
Kelley, from the United States.

31:10.546 --> 31:13.215
And Marco Blaine,
from Brazil.

31:15.885 --> 31:18.086
Gentlemen, begin.

31:29.264 --> 31:31.834
<i>Mickey went down
immediately,</i>

31:31.868 --> 31:35.671
<i>with his hand still reaching for
that handshake that was never coming.</i>

31:38.473 --> 31:40.642
<i>We had an agreement...</i>

31:40.677 --> 31:43.445
<i>that I wouldn't throw in the
towel unless he was unconscious.</i>

31:48.216 --> 31:49.284
Mick, I'm throwing the towel!

31:52.722 --> 31:55.357
<i>There was a pleading
in his eyes like...</i>

32:00.730 --> 32:02.431
<i>I should have listened to her.</i>

32:03.766 --> 32:05.601
<i>It was one of the most
vicious beatings</i>

32:05.634 --> 32:06.869
<i>I'd ever seen in my life.</i>

32:06.903 --> 32:08.270
<i>He was never even in the fight.</i>

32:53.281 --> 32:56.385
<i>Mickey suffered a broken eye
socket and a detached retina.</i>

32:58.888 --> 33:01.724
<i>He also had a partial
detachment in his right eye</i>

33:01.758 --> 33:05.394
<i>and was at risk for losing
his sight altogether.</i>

33:05.427 --> 33:08.798
<i>He would never be medically
cleared to fight again.</i>

33:13.568 --> 33:18.373
His son was born a month later,
on his 40th birthday.

33:20.509 --> 33:24.479
And in a strange way, it couldn't
have happened at a better time.

33:24.513 --> 33:27.215
And all the pain and the
depression he was going through,

33:27.249 --> 33:31.520
it just... vanished
when Kyd was born.

33:31.553 --> 33:35.624
The next few years there was
no more talk about fighting.

33:35.657 --> 33:39.628
Just got a new job and
focused on being a dad.

33:40.697 --> 33:41.731
They were getting by.

33:43.398 --> 33:46.301
<i>Until around late 1998,</i>

33:46.334 --> 33:50.572
<i>when MMA was fighting to get
sanctioned in the US.</i>

33:50.605 --> 33:52.674
Red Dragon Dojo.

33:52.709 --> 33:53.876
Yes, ma'am.

33:55.510 --> 33:58.681
Yes, ma'am, I can get him.
Just one second.

33:58.715 --> 34:01.684
<i>Our sport was incorporating
rules and becoming legit,</i>

34:01.718 --> 34:04.519
<i>going mainstream pretty quick.</i>

34:04.553 --> 34:05.888
<i>But I knew
that sooner or later,</i>

34:05.922 --> 34:07.690
<i>seeing the guy who took
so much from him</i>

34:07.724 --> 34:09.623
<i>on all the magazine covers</i>

34:09.658 --> 34:12.494
<i>would probably start
to get to Mick.</i>

34:22.536 --> 34:24.672
More commitment, Veronica.

34:24.706 --> 34:26.475
Nice, Chelsea.

34:26.507 --> 34:27.744
Hey, uh, Jimmy.

34:27.777 --> 34:30.312
Yes, Michael! What?

34:30.344 --> 34:32.514
Uh, it's your girlfriend.

34:32.547 --> 34:34.349
What the hell
does she want?

34:34.382 --> 34:36.551
All right, guys, keep it up.
I'll be right back.

34:37.552 --> 34:39.487
What?

34:39.521 --> 34:41.056
<i>After pushing a broom
during the day,</i>

34:41.090 --> 34:42.792
<i>Mick would pick up extra cash</i>

34:42.824 --> 34:44.994
<i>by teaching private lessons
in the evening.</i>

34:45.027 --> 34:46.728
Okay, now nothing outside
of what I've already taught you,

34:46.763 --> 34:48.063
but now I'm gonna
throw 'em at random.

34:48.097 --> 34:50.398
Speed it up a little bit, okay?
You ready?

34:52.768 --> 34:55.036
Fold the wrist first.

34:55.071 --> 34:56.670
Good job.
Fold it first.

34:58.808 --> 35:00.408
Palm over knuckles,
elbows together.

35:00.442 --> 35:02.879
Yes! Beautiful,
beautiful, beautiful.

35:06.783 --> 35:09.952
Nice! Good job,
good job, good job.

35:40.582 --> 35:43.485
- Daddy's home!
- Hey.

35:49.025 --> 35:50.458
Hi.

35:57.666 --> 36:00.002
I think I remember
having a son

36:00.036 --> 36:02.071
when I left for work.

36:02.104 --> 36:04.406
I wonder where he is.

36:04.439 --> 36:08.077
Hmm. Maybe he left
for college already.

36:10.813 --> 36:12.682
Where are you,
little shit?

36:41.911 --> 36:45.480
Daddy, can you tell me the story
about Mommy's famous chicken?

36:45.513 --> 36:47.750
You want Daddy to tell you
that story again?

36:47.783 --> 36:48.885
- Mm-hmm.
- That's a good story.

36:49.886 --> 36:51.854
I wanna say it was 1492.

36:51.888 --> 36:54.056
Oh. It was
a really long time ago.

36:54.090 --> 36:57.193
Mommy and Daddy were sailing the
ocean blue with their friend Chris.

36:57.226 --> 37:00.963
- Columbus? That one?
- I-I think that's... It rings a bell.

37:00.997 --> 37:02.965
We were looking for
a place called America

37:02.999 --> 37:04.466
'cause that's where
they were having

37:04.499 --> 37:06.903
the chicken finger
world championships.

37:06.936 --> 37:10.438
But we only had
one chicken left.

37:10.472 --> 37:13.541
- Mommy says it's not true.
- It is true.

37:13.575 --> 37:15.811
Mommy's just being humble.

37:15.845 --> 37:19.081
Remember what Daddy says, "We never let
the world see us beating our chest"?

37:19.115 --> 37:20.816
That's Mommy.

37:20.850 --> 37:24.854
Well, Mommy appreciates how
much Daddy likes her cooking,

37:24.887 --> 37:28.057
but that story... No.

37:28.090 --> 37:30.760
But they are the best
chicken fingers in the world.

37:32.094 --> 37:34.163
- Finish up your supper, dude.
- Mmkay.

37:35.563 --> 37:38.100
- I love you, dude.
- Love you.

37:47.143 --> 37:48.778
Hey.

37:48.811 --> 37:50.746
What's going on?

37:52.949 --> 37:54.616
You're working tonight,
aren't you?

37:57.053 --> 37:58.187
Yeah.

38:07.897 --> 38:10.199
Will you tell me
about him again?

38:10.232 --> 38:13.035
- Saint Sebastian?
- Yeah, is he dead?

38:13.069 --> 38:15.004
Well, he's not dead.

38:15.037 --> 38:17.707
But he was shot full arrows
and left for dead.

38:17.740 --> 38:21.277
But because of his incredible
fortitude and endurance,

38:21.310 --> 38:23.245
he survived.

38:23.279 --> 38:26.215
That's why he's the patron
saint of soldiers and athletes,

38:26.248 --> 38:28.184
'cause he never once
gave up.

38:29.551 --> 38:31.687
- Pretty cool, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

38:33.222 --> 38:35.057
Let's say our prayers
and go night-night, okay?

38:35.091 --> 38:36.025
Okay.

38:39.261 --> 38:41.998
- Angel of God...
- My guardian dear,

38:42.031 --> 38:44.200
to whom God's love
commits me here.

38:44.233 --> 38:46.969
Watch over me
throughout the night,

38:47.003 --> 38:49.739
and keep me safe
within your sight.

38:49.772 --> 38:50.638
Amen.

38:51.841 --> 38:53.309
Amen, dude.

39:06.689 --> 39:09.125
Jerome.

39:15.965 --> 39:17.833
- No!
- Gentlemen.

39:17.867 --> 39:19.869
- Don't touch me!
- How's everybody doing over here?

39:19.902 --> 39:21.837
We're doing all right.
How can I help you?

39:21.871 --> 39:24.606
Can I ask you gentlemen to move
to the other end of the bar?

39:24.639 --> 39:26.342
Happy to buy you
a couple rounds on me.

39:26.375 --> 39:27.676
I think I'm pretty comfortable
right here.

39:27.710 --> 39:29.045
- Yeah.
- I understand that,

39:29.078 --> 39:30.980
but if I can't get you
to the other end of the bar,

39:31.013 --> 39:33.082
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
I don't wanna do that.

39:33.115 --> 39:35.885
We want everybody
to have a good time.

39:35.918 --> 39:37.253
Thank you.
These guys won't stop...

39:37.286 --> 39:38.954
- Ma'am.
- ...hitting on my boyfriend.

39:38.988 --> 39:40.222
- Shut up, you stupid bitch.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa...

39:40.256 --> 39:41.824
No, no, no...

40:08.217 --> 40:09.885
Fuck's sake, Jerome!

40:09.919 --> 40:11.687
- Sorry, Mick.
- Get 'em out!

40:16.325 --> 40:18.160
Fuck!

40:18.194 --> 40:19.762
<i>I knew it was
gonna happen sooner or later.</i>

40:19.795 --> 40:21.864
I never wanted you
to go back to that job.

40:21.897 --> 40:24.066
Baby, there were two of them, and fucking
Jerome wasn't even paying attention.

40:24.100 --> 40:26.335
It doesn't ma... You know what
every single doctor has said.

40:26.368 --> 40:27.970
You could lose that eye.

40:28.003 --> 40:30.638
It's the only time it's happened
in the last two years.

40:30.672 --> 40:32.308
I got to keep bouncing

40:32.341 --> 40:33.809
until I can
build my student base.

40:33.843 --> 40:35.878
There's no other way
to pay for Kyd's school.

40:35.911 --> 40:36.979
Well, there are
plenty of other preschool...

40:37.012 --> 40:38.914
Yeah, cheaper, not better.

40:40.683 --> 40:42.384
I wanna give y'all
the better stuff.

40:44.820 --> 40:48.324
Look, babe, I could just go back to the law
office then, if that's what we need to do.

40:48.357 --> 40:50.359
What, then we're gonna earn money
to pay somebody else to raise Kyd?

40:50.392 --> 40:51.827
- No, we're not doing that.
- Bouncing is not a risk

40:51.861 --> 40:52.962
that you should be taking.

40:52.995 --> 40:54.997
I get in a car every day,
don't I?

40:55.030 --> 40:56.832
That's a risk. Come on.

40:56.866 --> 40:58.100
That's not the same thing.

40:58.134 --> 40:59.768
No, don't-don't do this.

41:03.205 --> 41:06.709
Mm, this-this-this
isn't just about money.

41:06.742 --> 41:08.177
I can see it in your eyes.

41:08.210 --> 41:10.212
This is about you
needing to satisfy

41:10.246 --> 41:12.848
this-this-this
competitive urge it is,

41:12.882 --> 41:14.850
or whatever it is,
that you call it.

41:14.884 --> 41:16.418
You want a fight.

41:16.452 --> 41:18.420
You we re looking
for a fight!

41:29.932 --> 41:31.400
Don't leave.
Come on.

41:35.337 --> 41:36.405
<i>Again?</i>

41:40.309 --> 41:41.443
Yeah.

41:45.214 --> 41:47.082
I see, I'm walking up now.

41:50.319 --> 41:52.421
I mean,
if I had some more students for privates,

41:52.454 --> 41:55.224
I wouldn't have to bounce.

41:55.257 --> 41:57.092
But they all want
an instructor

41:57.126 --> 41:59.028
who will roll hard with
them occasionally, you know?

41:59.061 --> 42:00.930
And actually throw.

42:00.963 --> 42:03.432
She's not gonna be
okay with that.

42:03.465 --> 42:05.467
Well, Mick, your doctor said
that you really shouldn't.

42:05.501 --> 42:09.004
Come on, the doctors are
exaggerating, you know?

42:09.038 --> 42:11.340
They're just trying to protect
themselves from lawsuits.

42:11.373 --> 42:15.010
I-I got hit the other day,
nothing happened. C'mon.

42:15.044 --> 42:17.213
We know a little hard rolling's
not gonna hurt anything.

42:18.948 --> 42:20.516
Maybe you could try
doing something

42:20.549 --> 42:22.885
where you don't have to get hit
in the face on a daily basis.

42:22.918 --> 42:25.387
Jiu-jitsu's
all I know, Taco.

42:27.223 --> 42:30.359
It's the only thing
I'm good at, man.

42:30.392 --> 42:33.362
I spent my whole life trying
to build a value to society

42:33.395 --> 42:35.431
in hopes that someday I could
trade little bits of it.

42:35.464 --> 42:38.534
Maybe get some money
to someday start a family,

42:38.567 --> 42:40.903
and I-I can't lose that.

42:43.939 --> 42:46.375
Without that,
I'm-I'm-I'm mediocre, man.

42:47.943 --> 42:50.279
And I'm scared shitless
of being mediocre.

43:05.160 --> 43:06.996
<i>These two were
hysterical.</i>

43:07.029 --> 43:08.831
<i>Mick wouldn't even
make it past midnight</i>

43:08.864 --> 43:11.133
<i>because Layla would come
and get him every time.</i>

43:13.302 --> 43:17.039
<i>They couldn't be mad at each other
for more than a couple of hours.</i>

43:17.072 --> 43:19.074
- Let's go home.
- Mm...

44:04.253 --> 44:06.455
Mr. Kelley?

44:06.488 --> 44:07.389
Yeah.

44:08.390 --> 44:10.326
We saw this fight on TV,

44:10.359 --> 44:13.228
and this one guy,
he did this move.

44:13.262 --> 44:15.931
I was wondering if you
could show it to us.

44:20.936 --> 44:23.405
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

44:25.107 --> 44:27.476
When your neck is inside
this triangle right here,

44:27.509 --> 44:29.378
when I apply pressure,

44:29.411 --> 44:30.946
it's actually gonna
collapse the carotid artery.

44:30.979 --> 44:32.648
It restricts the blood flow
to the brain,

44:32.682 --> 44:35.284
and your training partner's gonna
either have to ask you to stop,

44:35.317 --> 44:37.353
or he's gonna go unconscious.

44:37.386 --> 44:38.987
So, now just-just
get your hand ready,

44:39.021 --> 44:41.523
- and when you feel it, you tap, okay?
- Okay.

44:41.557 --> 44:43.592
- You ready?
- Uh, yeah.

44:43.625 --> 44:45.260
Okay, here we go.

44:47.129 --> 44:48.897
- You okay?
- Yeah.

44:48.931 --> 44:50.432
Can't you cause
brain damage?

44:50.466 --> 44:52.201
No, I mean, only if you hold the
choke

44:52.234 --> 44:53.669
well after your training
partner goes to sleep,

44:53.703 --> 44:57.072
but we're gentlemen, I mean,
we-we don't act like that.

44:57.106 --> 44:58.140
That's horrible.

44:58.173 --> 45:00.609
Belly down's even worse.

45:09.551 --> 45:11.019
So you hide
his hands underneath him.

45:11.053 --> 45:12.254
Then your training partner

45:12.287 --> 45:14.123
doesn't even have
the opportunity to tap.

45:14.156 --> 45:17.159
It's not the nicest thing
in the world to do, but, uh...

45:17.192 --> 45:21.196
I'll have to remember that next time I
find myself with a dude between my legs.

45:21.230 --> 45:22.965
Josh, what are you doing?

45:22.998 --> 45:25.434
Uh, thinking about
learning how to grapple.

45:25.467 --> 45:27.704
I mean, all the MMA guys
use some form of it.

45:27.737 --> 45:29.671
At least the guys who win.

45:29.706 --> 45:31.708
Their rules
favor ground fighters.

45:31.741 --> 45:36.345
Many techniques not allowed in
MMA, like bites, eye gouges,

45:36.378 --> 45:38.447
can easily stop
a grappling attack.

45:38.480 --> 45:40.315
Listen, Jimmy,
he-he just asked me

45:40.349 --> 45:41.617
to show him a position.
I meant no disrespect.

45:41.650 --> 45:43.519
I don't know why
you keep wasting your time

45:43.552 --> 45:45.320
with the gay
wrestling shit.

45:46.321 --> 45:47.523
Guys, let's
get out of here.

45:47.556 --> 45:49.191
What I'm teaching keeps them
on their feet

45:49.224 --> 45:50.993
and their opponents
on the floor.

45:51.026 --> 45:52.161
I know, I understand.

45:55.597 --> 45:59.435
Yeah, but what if someone surprises
you from behind, takes you down?

45:59.468 --> 46:02.971
Well, Josh,
it depends on the type of attack.

46:04.506 --> 46:07.509
If he tries from the back,
I have elbows to the face.

46:07.543 --> 46:09.611
Or if he tries to tackle me from
the front,

46:09.645 --> 46:12.749
I drop elbows right on his
spine, or I could box his ears.

46:12.782 --> 46:14.216
Whatever.

46:14.249 --> 46:16.452
Yeah, that would, uh...

46:16.485 --> 46:18.253
that would probably hurt.

46:21.190 --> 46:22.291
Oh...

46:24.393 --> 46:26.328
You-you don't think
it'd get you off me?

46:26.361 --> 46:28.597
- I didn't say that, Jimmy.
- Huh, old man?

46:28.630 --> 46:31.300
Why don't we try it?
Hm? Why don't we try it?

46:31.333 --> 46:33.302
Come on.

46:33.335 --> 46:34.670
You're gonna stand there,
and you're gonna tell my students

46:34.704 --> 46:36.271
that my techniques
don't work?

46:36.305 --> 46:37.707
Glove up and prove it.

46:37.740 --> 46:40.309
I'm not telling your students
anything, Jimmy.

46:40.342 --> 46:42.478
- Okay?
- Hey, no one has to get hurt.

46:42.511 --> 46:45.447
Soon as you were to stop,
just, you know, tap out.

46:45.481 --> 46:47.549
You're used to that, right?

46:54.556 --> 46:56.358
Gentlemen,
it's time to go.

46:56.391 --> 46:58.427
I got a lot of cleaning to do
before class tomorrow. Let's go.

46:58.460 --> 47:01.663
- Come on, Mick.
- Now! Come on.

47:01.698 --> 47:04.066
Choke.

47:05.300 --> 47:07.035
- Let's go, guys.
- Come on, Mick.

47:07.069 --> 47:09.338
What, are you afraid of
a little demonstration?

47:09.371 --> 47:10.740
I'll see you tomorrow.

47:20.215 --> 47:22.417
What are you doing?

47:22.451 --> 47:25.788
You wanna know what I teach?
I'll show you what I teach.

47:25.822 --> 47:28.357
- You wanna know why I think what you teach is garbage?
- Hey, guys.

47:28.390 --> 47:29.759
I'll show you that, too.

47:29.792 --> 47:31.126
Hell, I'll even give you
a roadmap

47:31.159 --> 47:32.294
as to what's gonna happen.

47:34.229 --> 47:35.364
I'm gonna close
the distance to clinch

47:35.397 --> 47:36.833
without so much
as taking a scratch.

47:36.866 --> 47:39.067
I'm gonna take you to the
ground, I'm gonna mount you,

47:39.101 --> 47:40.435
I'm gonna turn you over,
take your back,

47:40.469 --> 47:42.104
and I'm gonna choke you
unconscious.

47:42.137 --> 47:43.773
And then just so you don't
think it was a fluke,

47:43.806 --> 47:45.440
we're gonna do it
all over again.

47:45.474 --> 47:47.175
And I'm gonna do
the exact same thing

47:47.209 --> 47:49.144
in the exact same order,

47:49.177 --> 47:51.714
and there's not a goddamn
thing you can do about it.

47:51.748 --> 47:53.582
Okay.

47:53.615 --> 47:55.150
You just know
if you get too close,

47:55.183 --> 47:56.285
I'm throwing for real.

47:56.318 --> 47:57.519
What is going on?

47:57.553 --> 47:58.821
I'm throwing
with bad intentions.

47:58.855 --> 48:00.122
Okay, pal.

48:00.155 --> 48:01.423
Let's rock.

48:04.493 --> 48:05.728
Son of a bitch.

48:21.476 --> 48:23.780
- Oh, fuck you!
- Whoa. Did you see that?

48:23.813 --> 48:25.682
Fuck you! Let's go
again, pal! Come on!

48:25.715 --> 48:27.549
Let's go!
Come on! Bring it!

48:38.226 --> 48:40.662
Shit, shit, shit!

49:14.864 --> 49:16.799
Daddy's home!

49:16.833 --> 49:19.635
- Hi, Daddy!
- Hey, dude.

49:25.674 --> 49:28.543
- I am armed.
- Mm...

49:28.577 --> 49:31.179
No, you're not. You're unarmed.

49:31.213 --> 49:33.281
What has gotten into you?

49:36.953 --> 49:39.287
He's watching TV.

49:48.330 --> 49:50.465
<i>All I had to do was
log on to one of those forums.</i>

49:50.499 --> 49:52.735
But nobody was online
that much back then.

49:52.769 --> 49:56.438
I mean, shit, we still had dial
up, if you can remember that.

49:57.439 --> 49:59.709
Anyway...

49:59.742 --> 50:02.577
Turns out some interesting stuff went
down in Dubai a few months earlier.

50:04.747 --> 50:06.648
<i>So what do you
think would be a real challenge?</i>

50:06.683 --> 50:09.251
<i>I don't have
any real challenge out there.</i>

50:09.284 --> 50:10.987
<i>I run this division.</i>

50:11.020 --> 50:14.456
<i>All my fights the same:
I win, I win, I win.</i>

50:14.489 --> 50:16.425
<i>This guy don't try to win.</i>

50:16.458 --> 50:18.728
- <i>He just tries to survive...</i>
- <i>Fuck you, man!</i>

50:18.761 --> 50:21.698
- Whoa!
- <i>I'll take you on right now! Come on!</i>

50:21.731 --> 50:24.734
- <i>Right now!</i>
- <i>Get the fuck off my stage!</i>

50:34.609 --> 50:38.547
<i>Well, maybe Mr. Mason
would be a good challenger,</i>

50:38.580 --> 50:40.817
<i>but it's never a good idea
to fight your boss.</i>

50:45.620 --> 50:47.289
What are you
so mad about, Amin?

50:47.322 --> 50:49.658
He's the best.
Show respect.

50:49.692 --> 50:51.660
It's manipulated
to give him easy wins.

50:55.898 --> 50:57.867
Why doesn't he fight
Miletich then?

50:59.001 --> 51:00.737
Miletich would mangle him.

51:00.770 --> 51:03.538
No, Blaine's punches
are fucking dangerous, man.

51:03.572 --> 51:06.274
Whatever.
He's a cheater, anyways.

51:06.308 --> 51:09.478
Oh, so he's
a cheater now, huh?

51:09.511 --> 51:10.645
I'll show you.

51:21.824 --> 51:23.291
Wait, what?

51:23.325 --> 51:25.293
Your dad has tapes
of his tournaments?

51:25.327 --> 51:27.063
Yeah, I found them a few months ago.
He used to keep them in a safe,

51:27.096 --> 51:29.664
- but now they're just...
- Who's this big guy?

51:29.699 --> 51:31.466
He looks badass.

51:31.500 --> 51:33.035
White dude's
gonna get ass-raped.

51:33.069 --> 51:36.271
Oh, yeah? He was my
instructor when I was a kid.

51:45.815 --> 51:46.783
Ooh.

51:48.851 --> 51:50.753
Oh, shit.

51:54.924 --> 51:56.959
You think that guy
could beat Blaine?

51:56.993 --> 51:58.627
<i>Mickey Kelley!</i>

52:02.965 --> 52:04.599
Again, watch.

52:10.907 --> 52:14.309
<i>...we have Mickey Kelley,
from the United States.</i>

52:16.779 --> 52:19.081
- <i>And Marco Blaine, from Brazil.</i>
- No way.

52:19.115 --> 52:20.783
When was this?

52:20.817 --> 52:23.418
<i>Gentlemen, begin.</i>

52:29.025 --> 52:30.425
Wait a minute.

52:31.660 --> 52:33.763
- Was he still bowing?
- Yep.

52:33.796 --> 52:35.832
Dude, we gotta show
my brother.

52:35.865 --> 52:37.733
He thinks Marco's a god.

52:39.135 --> 52:40.569
When's he back from London?

52:40.602 --> 52:42.370
I'll just upload it
to my site.

52:44.740 --> 52:46.008
He wasn't even looking!

52:46.042 --> 52:48.678
- What? That's bullshit.
- Back it up.

52:56.618 --> 52:58.587
Bloody hell.

52:58.620 --> 53:02.124
We should post it in the forum.
I'll bet it'll get like 1,000 views.

53:29.218 --> 53:32.054
- Squash it.
- Pointless.

53:32.088 --> 53:34.757
It's been uploaded and ripped
a dozen times over.

53:34.790 --> 53:36.926
Oh, get out of here.

53:36.959 --> 53:38.560
You can hardly see
either of them

53:38.593 --> 53:40.062
from the distance
of this video.

53:40.096 --> 53:41.197
This thing could be a work.

53:41.230 --> 53:44.066
It wasn't a work.
This guy's good.

53:44.100 --> 53:45.735
And that is
clearly your boy.

53:46.736 --> 53:47.737
Let me tell you something.

53:49.471 --> 53:53.209
There is always some backyard
theoretical fighter

53:53.242 --> 53:55.144
who thinks he can
take on the pros.

53:55.177 --> 53:58.781
They never succeed,
they never will.

53:58.814 --> 54:01.918
So bring me somebody else
besides some fucking journeyman.

54:02.919 --> 54:04.452
Your number one contender's

54:04.486 --> 54:06.088
on a six-month
damage suspension.

54:06.122 --> 54:09.624
You asked me who I thought
would be the biggest draw.

54:09.658 --> 54:11.961
Now you log on
to any one of these forums,

54:11.994 --> 54:14.096
and you'll see that there's a
ton of buzz around this video.

54:14.130 --> 54:17.465
So you want to give
some nobody a title shot

54:17.499 --> 54:19.567
because he got
sucker-punched by Blaine,

54:19.601 --> 54:21.203
what, six years ago?

54:21.237 --> 54:24.140
Jesus, the clown's lucky that
Blaine ended him so quickly.

54:24.173 --> 54:26.474
You should watch
the whole video.

54:26.508 --> 54:27.944
'Cause this guy's
no journeyman.

54:27.977 --> 54:30.645
He is the real deal.

54:30.680 --> 54:33.548
- Oh, says who?
- People. People that know.

54:33.581 --> 54:35.785
And they're saying that Marco's
claim to being undefeated

54:35.818 --> 54:38.187
is hollow
because of this fight.

54:38.220 --> 54:41.857
And as soon as this hits the
magazines, it's inevitable.

54:41.891 --> 54:43.960
Everybody's gonna want
to see a rematch.

54:45.695 --> 54:46.929
Right?

54:46.963 --> 54:48.064
This is a story.

54:48.097 --> 54:49.799
This is the kind of story

54:49.832 --> 54:52.001
that dream fights
are made of.

54:52.034 --> 54:54.837
I don't finance
people's dreams.

54:54.870 --> 54:56.638
I finance their do's.

54:56.671 --> 54:58.207
Okay.

54:58.240 --> 55:00.242
Well, this isn't his dream.

55:00.276 --> 55:02.845
He doesn't even
know about it.

55:02.878 --> 55:04.947
I don't even know
if he would accept the fight.

55:04.981 --> 55:08.583
Dude just kinda
disappeared one day.

55:11.120 --> 55:12.254
Who is he?

55:14.156 --> 55:16.726
His name's Mickey Kelley.

55:16.759 --> 55:18.828
Pitt knows him.

55:18.861 --> 55:20.830
Personally,
I-I felt sorry for him, man.

55:20.863 --> 55:23.833
I mean...
I mean, hell, had to be

55:23.866 --> 55:25.968
like 40-something when I
caught back up with him.

55:26.002 --> 55:27.803
And you-you can't just go
that many years

55:27.837 --> 55:31.539
without high level training
and expect to be competitive.

55:31.573 --> 55:33.608
You know, I mean,
at least not against anybody who's good.

55:33.641 --> 55:36.779
So, um, you know...

55:36.812 --> 55:39.547
Jiu-jitsu
constantly evolves,

55:39.581 --> 55:41.549
and that's exactly
what I told Mason,

55:41.583 --> 55:44.020
but, you know, he insisted.

55:49.291 --> 55:51.193
Hello?

55:51.227 --> 55:52.695
Mick.

55:52.728 --> 55:54.096
Is that Pitt?

55:54.130 --> 55:55.698
Yeah.

55:59.969 --> 56:01.569
How you doing?

56:01.603 --> 56:03.039
Good, brother.
How you doing, man?

56:03.072 --> 56:05.174
- Good. It's good to see you.
- You too, man.

56:06.909 --> 56:08.811
What the fuck you
doing here, man?

56:08.844 --> 56:10.980
You know,
paying some bills.

56:11.013 --> 56:12.647
- You know?
- Yeah, okay.

56:12.681 --> 56:14.316
Hey, I heard
about the new gym.

56:14.350 --> 56:16.052
I'm, uh,
I'm proud of you, man.

56:16.085 --> 56:17.286
Thank you,
thank you, thank you.

56:17.319 --> 56:18.854
I knew you'd do something
with wrestling.

56:18.888 --> 56:20.756
Shit, man.

56:21.824 --> 56:23.658
So what's, uh...
What's going on?

56:23.692 --> 56:25.327
- Travis, this is Mick. Mick, meet Travis.
- How are you, man?

56:25.361 --> 56:26.962
- What's up, man? Nice to meet you.
- Very nice to meet you.

56:26.996 --> 56:28.898
He's been training with me
for a little bit.

56:28.931 --> 56:30.632
I'm looking to get him some
fights, I want him to get

56:30.665 --> 56:33.302
some more different styles,
and I was telling him

56:33.335 --> 56:35.905
that you was a slippery
motherfucker back in the day, so...

56:35.938 --> 56:37.206
Well, I appreciate that, man.

56:37.239 --> 56:38.974
I was just wondering if, um...

56:39.008 --> 56:40.810
You mind rolling with him
a little bit?

56:40.843 --> 56:42.044
See how he does?

56:42.078 --> 56:45.147
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

56:45.181 --> 56:46.849
Right-right now?

56:46.882 --> 56:48.951
- I got my gear with me. I'm ready.
- If it's okay.

56:51.954 --> 56:53.389
Yeah, we could, uh...

56:53.422 --> 56:55.891
You want me
to grab the broom or...?

56:55.925 --> 56:57.760
- No, that's-that's...
- Okay. All right.

56:57.793 --> 56:59.128
- Let's go.
- Okay, let's go.

56:59.161 --> 57:00.763
- You good?
- Uh, yeah.

57:00.796 --> 57:02.298
Yeah. Let's get it.
Let's get it.

57:02.331 --> 57:03.699
Let's get it.

57:08.270 --> 57:09.671
Watch your neck.
Watch your neck. Watch...

57:09.705 --> 57:11.307
Neck, neck, neck!

57:13.109 --> 57:14.376
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm good. I'm good.

57:14.410 --> 57:16.779
That's a good warm up.

57:16.812 --> 57:17.947
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
- All right?

57:22.118 --> 57:23.052
Hey.

57:24.053 --> 57:25.888
Close the elbow.
Hey, close...

57:25.921 --> 57:27.223
Close the elbow right there.

57:29.024 --> 57:30.759
Watch your neck...
Neck, neck.

57:30.793 --> 57:32.394
He's looking for the... neck.

57:37.133 --> 57:38.167
Now, fight.

57:39.802 --> 57:41.237
Watch the fade.
Nothing there. Nothing there.

57:41.270 --> 57:43.372
A little hand play right here.

57:43.405 --> 57:45.274
Uh-huh. Okay.

57:45.307 --> 57:46.976
Uh-huh.

57:47.009 --> 57:48.444
Beautiful shot, Travis!

57:48.477 --> 57:49.879
Widen your base.
There you go!

57:49.912 --> 57:51.313
Uh-huh. Yeah.

57:51.347 --> 57:54.283
Ah, he's reaching under.
He's reaching under.

57:54.316 --> 57:55.885
Mother...

57:58.287 --> 58:00.956
Turn the corner.

58:00.990 --> 58:02.124
Watch the arm.

58:02.158 --> 58:03.826
Watch the ar...
Turn into him.

58:03.859 --> 58:06.262
Turn into him.

58:06.295 --> 58:09.131
No. Breathe. No, no, you good.
He's going for the arm.

58:15.137 --> 58:16.772
You all right?

58:16.805 --> 58:18.073
Yeah. I'm good, man.

58:20.042 --> 58:21.277
All right, Mick.

58:21.310 --> 58:22.444
Give it to him straight.

58:22.478 --> 58:23.946
You know,
I think you know

58:23.979 --> 58:25.814
you leave your neck
dangling on that shot.

58:25.848 --> 58:28.784
Uh, you know, on the single,
uh, run the pipe quick.

58:28.817 --> 58:32.788
Uh, keep your elbows tucked just so I
can't get the Kimura grip figure-four.

58:32.821 --> 58:34.323
I mean, this is nothing
that Pitt can't...

58:34.356 --> 58:37.326
- Chicken wing.
- ...fix, you know. It's, uh...

58:37.359 --> 58:38.994
I mean, you clean those up,
you'll be...

58:39.028 --> 58:42.031
You'll be dangerous, buddy,
I promise you.

58:42.064 --> 58:44.366
Yeah, maybe I'll do that.

58:44.400 --> 58:46.802
- Thanks, man. I appreciate it.
- Of course.

58:46.835 --> 58:48.170
- Pitt, I'll see you outside.
- Yeah.

58:48.204 --> 58:49.305
Okay.

58:56.412 --> 58:57.479
All right, TP.

58:57.513 --> 59:00.082
Yeah, good train.

59:01.417 --> 59:03.285
- Was that all right?
- You really don't know

59:03.319 --> 59:05.521
what the fuck is going on
out in the world, do you?

59:05.554 --> 59:07.223
What're you talking about?

59:07.256 --> 59:08.757
Bro, that's
Travis Prince, man.

59:08.791 --> 59:10.292
He just won
Brazilian nationals.

59:13.429 --> 59:14.897
Like I asked you before...

59:16.131 --> 59:18.200
What the fuck
are you doing here?

59:23.072 --> 59:24.473
Oh, trust me,
he's still got it.

59:24.506 --> 59:26.408
If he's injured,
I can't tell.

59:26.442 --> 59:28.978
<i>Really?
Don't say anything to him just yet.</i>

59:29.011 --> 59:30.446
Nope, I won't
mention it to him.

59:30.479 --> 59:32.114
I'm actually thinking about
offering him a job,

59:32.147 --> 59:34.516
so I don't want his head
to get too big if I do.

59:34.550 --> 59:36.118
<i>What do you mean?</i>

59:36.151 --> 59:37.820
<i>What, you think
the guy's that good?</i>

59:37.853 --> 59:39.255
Well, I'll tell you what,

59:39.288 --> 59:40.990
if you do end up putting
this fight together,

59:41.023 --> 59:42.324
my money is not gonna be
on your boy.

59:42.358 --> 59:44.293
<i>What? Are you joking?</i>

59:44.326 --> 59:46.161
Yeah... Let me put it
this way.

59:46.195 --> 59:50.032
If the fight goes to the
ground, your man is fucked.

59:52.835 --> 59:54.370
You know
I would, man.

59:56.171 --> 59:57.373
Yeah.

59:59.008 --> 01:00:00.276
Hey.

01:00:00.309 --> 01:00:01.310
What's going on?

01:00:01.343 --> 01:00:03.112
So... you know,
let me, uh...

01:00:03.145 --> 01:00:06.048
Let me talk to Layla about it,
and I'll-I'll call you tomorrow.

01:00:06.081 --> 01:00:08.550
All right?
Okay. Talk soon.

01:00:08.584 --> 01:00:10.185
Who was that?

01:00:11.520 --> 01:00:13.989
You remember...
You remember Pitt, right?

01:00:14.023 --> 01:00:15.524
Terry? Yeah.

01:00:15.557 --> 01:00:19.128
Well, he started an MMA
training facility a while back,

01:00:19.161 --> 01:00:21.397
and he'd like me
to teach grappling.

01:00:23.299 --> 01:00:25.467
Baby, I wouldn't
have to bounce any...

01:00:47.890 --> 01:00:50.125
I'm so sorry.

01:00:50.159 --> 01:00:51.527
So am I.

01:00:51.560 --> 01:00:53.395
Just promise me
you're gonna be careful.

01:00:53.429 --> 01:00:56.065
- I will.
- Okay.

01:01:43.412 --> 01:01:45.013
Watch the leg, though.
Watch the leg.

01:01:45.047 --> 01:01:46.048
Hey, Pitt?

01:01:48.150 --> 01:01:49.151
Pitt!

01:01:51.387 --> 01:01:54.323
There he is.
There he is.

01:01:54.356 --> 01:01:56.693
What's up, brother?

01:01:56.726 --> 01:01:57.993
Wow.

01:01:58.026 --> 01:02:00.662
Welcome home, baby.
Welcome home.

01:02:00.697 --> 01:02:02.264
When your opponent
switches base,

01:02:02.297 --> 01:02:05.100
head side, he's on top.
There's two options, really.

01:02:05.134 --> 01:02:06.368
Opponent's head's
going to be high.

01:02:06.402 --> 01:02:08.103
So can you turn into me?

01:02:08.137 --> 01:02:10.973
Now when I'm ready,
I'm gonna hip escape out,

01:02:11.006 --> 01:02:12.641
and I'm gonna straighten
that table.

01:02:12.674 --> 01:02:14.309
Table disappears...

01:02:15.444 --> 01:02:17.112
and I come to the top position.

01:02:17.146 --> 01:02:19.548
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

01:02:19.581 --> 01:02:20.582
Beautiful.

01:02:20.616 --> 01:02:22.084
Where do his hands go?

01:02:22.117 --> 01:02:23.118
To his face.

01:02:23.152 --> 01:02:25.220
This hand is solely there

01:02:25.254 --> 01:02:28.157
to prevent me from closing
the distance to you.

01:02:28.190 --> 01:02:29.591
Stop, stop,
stop, stop, stop.

01:02:29.625 --> 01:02:30.693
Not for your face.

01:02:30.727 --> 01:02:33.962
Guys, leverage and efficiency.

01:02:33.996 --> 01:02:35.964
He's right over there.

01:02:35.998 --> 01:02:37.132
Hey, yo, Mick.

01:02:37.166 --> 01:02:39.435
Guys, excuse me
for one second.

01:02:39.468 --> 01:02:42.104
- Dad!
- Dude!

01:02:43.572 --> 01:02:46.241
I didn't expect visitors
on my first day of work.

01:02:46.275 --> 01:02:48.110
What is happening
right now?

01:02:48.143 --> 01:02:51.681
- Oh, choke! I tap out! Daddy taps out!
- Okay, okay.

01:02:51.714 --> 01:02:55.284
Well, we wanted to come
and see Daddy's new office.

01:02:56.452 --> 01:02:57.419
Thank you.

01:02:59.321 --> 01:03:01.156
This is amazing.

01:03:01.190 --> 01:03:02.759
Daddy thinks so, too.

01:03:02.792 --> 01:03:05.127
I'm very excited
about this place.

01:03:05.160 --> 01:03:07.262
Dad, when will I
get to fight?

01:03:07.296 --> 01:03:09.965
Well, if everything goes
according to plan, never.

01:03:10.767 --> 01:03:14.002
- Why?
- Hey.

01:03:14.036 --> 01:03:17.206
Daddy's already taught you the
self-defense aspects of jiu-jitsu.

01:03:17.239 --> 01:03:19.742
And that'll get you out of just about
any problem that comes up to you.

01:03:19.776 --> 01:03:23.078
But you're not getting
in a ring or a cage.

01:03:23.111 --> 01:03:25.280
Daddy wants you to have
other options in life.

01:03:25.314 --> 01:03:27.149
All I learned is fighting.

01:03:27.182 --> 01:03:29.318
And I wish I had
those options.

01:03:29.351 --> 01:03:32.554
But I want you
to be different.

01:03:32.588 --> 01:03:36.225
Mr. Pitt says kids
my age can fight.

01:03:36.258 --> 01:03:38.327
Oh, is that
what Mr. Pitt says?

01:03:38.360 --> 01:03:42.364
I-I don't really recall having that
conversation with you... whatsoever.

01:03:42.397 --> 01:03:44.767
'Cause I think I recall having
a conversation with Mr. Pitt,

01:03:44.801 --> 01:03:46.635
and telling him
"Not my kid."

01:03:46.668 --> 01:03:49.238
- The kid would never fight.
- He... Never.

01:03:49.271 --> 01:03:52.508
Yeah, so when-when
we were talking, that we...

01:03:52.541 --> 01:03:54.276
You weren't supposed
to mention that, man.

01:03:54.309 --> 01:03:56.044
I just had to.

01:03:56.078 --> 01:03:58.313
I'll tell you what I'll do...

01:03:58.347 --> 01:04:00.115
- Pitt, throw me the glove.
- Here.

01:04:00.148 --> 01:04:02.251
Give me your hand.

01:04:02.284 --> 01:04:04.486
Put it in here.
Right there.

01:04:04.520 --> 01:04:06.522
Look at that.

01:04:06.555 --> 01:04:09.324
When that fits,
we'll talk about it.

01:04:09.358 --> 01:04:11.393
- You understand?
- Yes, sir.

01:04:11.426 --> 01:04:15.130
<i>And for a brief moment,
everything seemed okay.</i>

01:04:15.163 --> 01:04:18.600
<i>But, eventually, that video
caught up with him.</i>

01:04:44.459 --> 01:04:46.395
It's me.

01:04:46.428 --> 01:04:47.462
All right.

01:04:48.463 --> 01:04:49.732
Call his manager.

01:04:51.266 --> 01:04:53.468
If the guy's even got one.

01:05:23.298 --> 01:05:24.499
Now he's gonna
take him down.

01:05:29.872 --> 01:05:31.640
Textbook movement.

01:05:39.381 --> 01:05:43.485
<i>The winner,
by submission, Mickey Kelley!</i>

01:05:43.518 --> 01:05:46.723
<i>That same day,
I got a call from Brian Burchman,</i>

01:05:46.756 --> 01:05:49.358
<i>some big shot matchmaker.</i>

01:05:49.391 --> 01:05:51.928
<i>He gave me a bunch of forums
to check out.</i>

01:05:51.961 --> 01:05:55.597
<i>Sure enough, all the talk was
of Mickey being the only fighter</i>

01:05:55.631 --> 01:05:57.666
<i>that could possibly
beat Blaine.</i>

01:05:57.700 --> 01:06:01.169
<i>The public
was demanding a rematch.</i>

01:06:01.203 --> 01:06:03.873
<i>But Mickey was 46 years old,
and out of training,</i>

01:06:03.906 --> 01:06:07.576
<i>while Blaine was 31
and at the top of his game,</i>

01:06:07.609 --> 01:06:09.411
<i>not to mention
the other problem.</i>

01:06:09.444 --> 01:06:11.313
<i>Your boy's
becoming a legend.</i>

01:06:11.346 --> 01:06:13.482
<i>He'd be stupid
not to cash in on this.</i>

01:06:13.515 --> 01:06:16.551
Yeah, but he might have
an issue with the physical.

01:06:16.585 --> 01:06:18.353
He's got a bad eye.

01:06:18.387 --> 01:06:19.956
<i>Don't worry,
if he wants to fight,</i>

01:06:19.989 --> 01:06:22.624
<i>I got a doctor for him.</i>

01:06:22.658 --> 01:06:23.960
Look, it doesn't matter
what I say,

01:06:23.993 --> 01:06:26.829
I know he'll want the fight.

01:06:26.863 --> 01:06:28.497
He's not the problem.

01:06:28.530 --> 01:06:31.801
Babe, it's $75,000
just to walk in the ring.

01:06:31.834 --> 01:06:33.803
It's more than I make
in a year.

01:06:33.836 --> 01:06:36.739
I don't care if it's a million dollars.
I can't let you do it!

01:06:36.773 --> 01:06:38.908
- Okay, could you just let me...
- No, for five years

01:06:38.941 --> 01:06:41.844
I have felt guilty for letting
you do something so stupid.

01:06:41.878 --> 01:06:45.247
Okay, I was young.
I thought I could win.

01:06:45.280 --> 01:06:47.549
I'm older now,
I know I can't win.

01:06:47.582 --> 01:06:50.218
I'll go there,
I'll roll around,

01:06:50.252 --> 01:06:51.954
at the first sign of trouble,
I'll tap.

01:06:51.988 --> 01:06:54.456
And we'll go home
with some money.

01:06:54.489 --> 01:06:57.459
Do you really expect me to
believe that when you get there,

01:06:57.492 --> 01:06:59.996
you can get in that ring
with that fucking prick

01:07:00.029 --> 01:07:01.864
and you're going to be able
to resist the urge

01:07:01.898 --> 01:07:03.665
to give him the ass-kicking
that he deserves?

01:07:03.700 --> 01:07:06.836
Really? Really? Okay,
well, go ahead.

01:07:06.869 --> 01:07:09.504
Look me in the eye,
and tell me that.

01:07:13.943 --> 01:07:15.210
I can't.

01:07:16.846 --> 01:07:21.718
I mean, when you met me,
I was great at something.

01:07:21.751 --> 01:07:23.953
I was confident,
and I was proud,

01:07:23.986 --> 01:07:27.322
and I had this thing that I
carried with me everywhere.

01:07:29.025 --> 01:07:32.494
You take that away from me,
and I'm not the same.

01:07:33.996 --> 01:07:36.465
I'm not even...

01:07:36.498 --> 01:07:38.233
I'm not even a man anymore.

01:07:41.070 --> 01:07:44.874
I had somebody like that
for a dad.

01:07:44.907 --> 01:07:47.542
And I just don't
want that around Kyd.

01:07:55.617 --> 01:07:57.419
I need to face him.

01:08:01.057 --> 01:08:02.058
I do.

01:08:02.091 --> 01:08:04.326
No. No.

01:08:23.578 --> 01:08:25.814
I was barely okay
with him teaching privates,

01:08:25.848 --> 01:08:27.850
but this-this is just...

01:08:27.884 --> 01:08:31.553
Crazy? I know.

01:08:33.354 --> 01:08:35.323
Privates don't always
try to hurt him,

01:08:35.357 --> 01:08:38.627
but in-in a cage,
it's literally all they're trying to do.

01:08:45.367 --> 01:08:46.969
- Maybe I can just...
- But I love him.

01:08:48.670 --> 01:08:51.741
And it's a question
he needs answered, so...

01:08:52.809 --> 01:08:55.011
If I don't let him do it,

01:08:55.044 --> 01:08:57.379
it's going to eat away
at him forever.

01:08:57.412 --> 01:09:00.716
He's gonna end up resenting me
and I will lose him anyway.

01:09:02.417 --> 01:09:05.020
Now I know why
you two are married.

01:09:05.054 --> 01:09:07.589
You're just as nuts
as he is.

01:09:18.901 --> 01:09:21.603
Promise me
on your godson's head

01:09:21.636 --> 01:09:24.073
that if I tell you
to stop the fight,

01:09:24.106 --> 01:09:26.742
that you will
stop the fight.

01:09:36.118 --> 01:09:37.352
Thank you.

01:09:48.430 --> 01:09:50.131
Hey.

01:09:50.166 --> 01:09:51.533
Okay.

01:09:53.002 --> 01:09:54.502
Okay?

01:10:00.542 --> 01:10:01.978
I love you.

01:10:03.212 --> 01:10:06.816
- A lot.
- I know, me too.

01:10:10.552 --> 01:10:13.789
<i>Before he even had a contract,
Mickey started training his ass off.</i>

01:10:15.992 --> 01:10:18.426
Come on, let's hit it.
Let's go, Mick.

01:10:18.460 --> 01:10:20.029
- You got this, baby.
- Put in that work, baby.

01:10:20.062 --> 01:10:22.732
Put in that work.

01:10:22.765 --> 01:10:24.066
Uh-huh.

01:10:24.100 --> 01:10:25.634
Keep working.

01:10:28.170 --> 01:10:30.605
All right, here's the reality
of the situation, Mick.

01:10:30.639 --> 01:10:33.608
If you stand it with this guy. you got
a life expectancy of 60 seconds, okay?

01:10:33.642 --> 01:10:36.946
The longer you're up,
the more chances you got of getting hit.

01:10:36.979 --> 01:10:37.980
All right, brother?

01:10:38.014 --> 01:10:39.682
<i>Building strength,</i>

01:10:39.715 --> 01:10:41.918
<i>building speed.</i>

01:10:41.951 --> 01:10:44.720
- All right, baby. Come on, push it.
- Come on.

01:10:44.754 --> 01:10:46.789
<i>You're gonna need
to close the distance</i>

01:10:46.822 --> 01:10:50.059
<i>and take him to the ground
faster than ever.</i>

01:10:50.092 --> 01:10:51.994
<i>And once he's down,</i>

01:10:52.028 --> 01:10:53.863
<i>you don't have unlimited time
like you did in old days, man.</i>

01:10:53.896 --> 01:10:55.563
<i>You got five minute rounds,</i>

01:10:55.597 --> 01:10:57.565
<i>so you're gonna have
to submit him before the bell.</i>

01:10:57.599 --> 01:11:00.069
<i>On top of that,
Marco's been working on his ground game,</i>

01:11:00.102 --> 01:11:01.771
<i>so he's not the same
jiu-jitsu newbie.</i>

01:11:03.239 --> 01:11:04.539
<i>We're gonna give you
the clinch strength</i>

01:11:04.572 --> 01:11:05.841
<i>of a goddamn silverback, boy.</i>

01:11:05.875 --> 01:11:07.209
<i>You hear me?</i>

01:11:07.243 --> 01:11:09.644
<i>So that when you're
on the ground,</i>

01:11:09.679 --> 01:11:11.546
<i>you're gonna manipulate him
like a Gumby doll.</i>

01:11:13.648 --> 01:11:15.851
<i>Working on techniques
that would help his left side</i>

01:11:15.885 --> 01:11:17.720
<i>get protected
as much as possible...</i>

01:11:17.753 --> 01:11:19.155
Forget the hill drop, okay?

01:11:19.188 --> 01:11:20.923
Don't worry about taking
his back or nothing like that.

01:11:20.957 --> 01:11:23.793
Blaine knows you're a grappler, okay?
He's expecting that.

01:11:23.826 --> 01:11:25.895
Take him over the top.

01:11:25.928 --> 01:11:28.030
Suplex.

01:11:28.064 --> 01:11:30.933
<i>...while trying new
strategies keep Blaine on his toes.</i>

01:11:43.846 --> 01:11:45.247
<i>But it was all pointless.</i>

01:11:52.254 --> 01:11:53.956
<i>Begin.</i>

01:11:58.194 --> 01:12:00.796
<i>Mason
had fought so hard</i>

01:12:00.830 --> 01:12:02.664
<i>to bring the sport
to the mainstream...</i>

01:12:05.067 --> 01:12:08.838
<i>that he couldn't risk having
a fighter get massacred on TV.</i>

01:12:08.871 --> 01:12:11.606
<i>So before officially
announcing the fight,</i>

01:12:11.639 --> 01:12:14.276
<i>he brought in a real doctor
for Mickey's physical.</i>

01:12:20.216 --> 01:12:23.753
<i>Mickey passed everything with flying
colors up until the vision test.</i>

01:12:42.171 --> 01:12:45.007
<i>There was no way Mick
was getting cleared.</i>

01:12:45.041 --> 01:12:48.978
That was March 8th, 2001.

01:12:51.747 --> 01:12:53.949
<i>His car was at my shop
with a bad carb,</i>

01:12:53.983 --> 01:12:56.152
<i>so I dropped him off
at the doctor's.</i>

01:13:00.655 --> 01:13:02.858
Layla was gonna pick him up.

01:13:11.167 --> 01:13:14.036
<i>Me and Kyd were
coming back from Hobby Shack.</i>

01:13:14.070 --> 01:13:16.205
Grandma! Grandma Taco!

01:13:16.238 --> 01:13:17.807
Look what Uncle got me!

01:13:20.342 --> 01:13:22.678
- <i>...ran a stop sign...</i>
- <i>6:00 p.m.</i>

01:13:22.711 --> 01:13:23.979
<i>...crashing into
a Volkswagen Beetle.</i>

01:13:24.013 --> 01:13:25.347
<i>I actually saw it
on the news.</i>

01:13:25.381 --> 01:13:26.782
<i>First responders
are on the scene.</i>

01:13:31.720 --> 01:13:32.721
Yeah.

01:13:41.997 --> 01:13:43.265
Layla's death...

01:13:44.767 --> 01:13:46.268
changed Mick
in a way that...

01:13:47.837 --> 01:13:49.839
I'll never be able
to describe.

01:13:52.141 --> 01:13:53.641
<i>He never said it, but...</i>

01:13:56.145 --> 01:13:58.814
he felt responsible.

01:14:00.816 --> 01:14:03.419
<i>It was all over his face.</i>

01:14:03.452 --> 01:14:06.088
<i>If only he hadn't...</i>

01:14:43.726 --> 01:14:45.928
Hey, dumbass! I'm talking to you!

01:14:45.961 --> 01:14:47.897
Hey, man, you all right?

01:14:47.930 --> 01:14:49.899
- No, I'm good. I'm-I'm going.
- You all right, brother?

01:14:49.932 --> 01:14:52.034
Everything okay?

01:14:59.775 --> 01:15:02.278
I think Kyd was the only
thing keeping him alive.

01:15:07.283 --> 01:15:09.919
<i>Remember to tell your mom
about the honor roll, all right?</i>

01:15:09.952 --> 01:15:11.820
- Okay.
- She's gonna be very proud of you.

01:15:13.756 --> 01:15:15.858
And tell her
I had you try sushi, okay?

01:15:15.891 --> 01:15:18.961
- Okay.
- You don't have to tell her you thought it sucked.

01:15:18.994 --> 01:15:20.696
Keep that to yourself.

01:15:26.335 --> 01:15:28.938
- Hey, dude.
- Oh, thanks.

01:15:33.509 --> 01:15:35.077
Aren't you coming?

01:15:35.110 --> 01:15:38.914
No, you know, I...
I came earlier today.

01:15:38.948 --> 01:15:42.284
- Oh.
- So this is, uh...

01:15:42.318 --> 01:15:44.920
- This is your time. You go. Okay?
- Okay.

01:15:46.555 --> 01:15:49.124
And tell her you're gonna learn
how to surf this summer! Huh?

01:15:49.158 --> 01:15:51.794
And that you love her.
That we...

01:15:58.100 --> 01:16:00.202
That we love her,
buddy.

01:16:12.982 --> 01:16:15.284
- Night-night, dude.
- Night-night.

01:16:15.317 --> 01:16:16.452
What about our prayers?

01:16:19.555 --> 01:16:21.290
Yeah.

01:16:21.323 --> 01:16:22.992
Yeah, we can.

01:16:28.530 --> 01:16:31.300
Angel of God,
my guardian dear,

01:16:31.333 --> 01:16:34.370
to whom God's love
commits me here.

01:16:34.403 --> 01:16:36.939
<i>Watch over me
throughout the night,</i>

01:16:36.972 --> 01:16:39.241
<i>and keep me safe
within your sight.</i>

01:16:39.275 --> 01:16:40.342
<i>Amen.</i>

01:16:42.978 --> 01:16:44.580
You know, I really appreciate
how much you and your mom

01:16:44.613 --> 01:16:46.148
have helped out with Kyd.

01:16:48.017 --> 01:16:49.151
Come on, bro.

01:16:50.319 --> 01:16:51.820
You're family.

01:16:53.355 --> 01:16:54.423
How you holding up?

01:16:55.991 --> 01:16:58.360
Feels like a fridge
fell on my chest, man.

01:16:58.394 --> 01:17:04.233
Feel like my lungs just aren't
filling up properly when I breathe.

01:17:04.266 --> 01:17:07.970
And I don't want Kyd to
see me like this, you know?

01:17:09.238 --> 01:17:11.206
You're being
really hard on yourself.

01:17:13.175 --> 01:17:15.177
It's a tough thing
you're going through.

01:17:16.545 --> 01:17:18.414
You remember
what I told you about, uh...

01:17:19.648 --> 01:17:21.150
about my dad?

01:17:22.251 --> 01:17:23.852
Yeah, he walked out on you.

01:17:23.886 --> 01:17:24.953
Killed himself.

01:17:26.121 --> 01:17:28.490
Right after
he killed my mom.

01:17:28.524 --> 01:17:30.059
Life gave him
a couple hard knocks

01:17:30.092 --> 01:17:32.494
and he took it out on us.

01:17:34.396 --> 01:17:37.533
I guess he couldn't...
provide for us, you know?

01:17:37.566 --> 01:17:40.969
So he just... he just...
He fuckin' gave up.

01:17:41.003 --> 01:17:42.871
And he took
my mom with him.

01:17:44.907 --> 01:17:45.974
And I'm...

01:17:47.309 --> 01:17:48.911
I'm fucking ashamed
of that, man.

01:17:50.179 --> 01:17:51.480
When I got out of the
military, you know,

01:17:51.513 --> 01:17:56.118
I-I took my mom's
maiden name, legally.

01:17:56.151 --> 01:18:00.022
I wanted to throw away everything
about that fucking O'Sullivan name.

01:18:00.055 --> 01:18:02.958
I wanted nothing to do
with anything that he was.

01:18:06.362 --> 01:18:08.230
Why are you
telling me this now?

01:18:08.263 --> 01:18:10.332
'Cause I need you
to know who I am.

01:18:10.366 --> 01:18:15.571
And I don't want Kyd to see that
same defeat in my eyes, you know?

01:18:15.604 --> 01:18:18.273
I want him to know
the Kelleys keep fighting.

01:18:19.408 --> 01:18:20.609
We don't stop.

01:18:23.245 --> 01:18:24.246
You know...

01:18:25.715 --> 01:18:28.617
A good dad is not
supposed to tell his son

01:18:28.650 --> 01:18:30.219
how to live his life,
you know?

01:18:30.252 --> 01:18:32.554
He's just supposed
to live it correctly

01:18:32.588 --> 01:18:34.189
and let him watch.

01:18:39.228 --> 01:18:41.230
And I know he's watching, man.

01:18:44.533 --> 01:18:47.136
I just never...

01:18:47.169 --> 01:18:50.439
planned on doing this
without her, you know?

01:18:58.681 --> 01:19:00.048
Listen...

01:19:03.552 --> 01:19:05.320
You're gonna
get through this.

01:19:06.989 --> 01:19:08.490
I promise.

01:19:12.528 --> 01:19:15.164
- God doesn't give you...
- Don't, man.

01:19:15.197 --> 01:19:18.066
Just don't...
don't bring up God.

01:19:20.035 --> 01:19:22.070
I got some fuckin'
words for him.

01:19:25.240 --> 01:19:27.309
That's what Layla
would say if she was here.

01:19:33.750 --> 01:19:37.286
Remember that time she showed
up at my place crying...

01:19:39.021 --> 01:19:40.656
'cause you told her you
were gonna take the fight?

01:19:48.430 --> 01:19:50.032
You know
what she said to me?

01:19:50.065 --> 01:19:51.701
No. What?

01:19:53.302 --> 01:19:56.538
Was that the moment
that you got into that ring,

01:19:56.572 --> 01:20:00.042
and you looked that son
of a bitch in the eyes...

01:20:00.075 --> 01:20:03.713
He's gonna know he can win,
and he's not gonna stop until he does.

01:20:26.668 --> 01:20:30.239
Guys. Gi's on, belts on.
Class starts in five minutes.

01:20:34.543 --> 01:20:36.011
Hey, Mick.

01:20:38.180 --> 01:20:39.181
Hey, uh...

01:20:40.649 --> 01:20:42.584
Hey, listen, I, uh...

01:20:42.618 --> 01:20:44.286
I heard about your wife.

01:20:45.287 --> 01:20:46.522
I'm sorry, man.

01:20:47.656 --> 01:20:49.024
I'm really sorry.

01:20:51.193 --> 01:20:53.195
Look, if you
ever need anything...

01:20:54.196 --> 01:20:55.765
I mean it.

01:20:55.798 --> 01:20:57.666
I-I appreciate that.

01:21:00.302 --> 01:21:03.171
Yeah. Okay.

01:21:07.342 --> 01:21:08.443
Jimmy.

01:21:09.879 --> 01:21:11.814
What are you doing here?

01:21:14.483 --> 01:21:16.652
Well, I've been going over
what you did to me on the mat

01:21:16.686 --> 01:21:19.288
for the past few years,
and I, uh...

01:21:20.857 --> 01:21:23.525
Well, I just... I can't wrap
my head around it.

01:21:24.794 --> 01:21:26.194
So I signed up
for your evening class.

01:21:29.565 --> 01:21:30.767
I'll be seeing you.

01:21:34.804 --> 01:21:36.739
Yo, Mick, phone call.

01:21:38.540 --> 01:21:40.409
Hey, Pitt,
can you take a message?

01:21:40.442 --> 01:21:43.412
Well, he says it's important.
Some dude from Dubai.

01:21:44.513 --> 01:21:46.381
<i>Some time in late July,</i>

01:21:46.415 --> 01:21:48.851
<i>Mick got a call
from his old friend in Dubai.</i>

01:21:48.885 --> 01:21:52.654
<i>Turns out, Dimitris found out about
the rematch that never happened</i>

01:21:52.689 --> 01:21:55.490
<i>and offered to put it up
himself with the same purse.</i>

01:21:55.524 --> 01:21:58.193
<i>Seventy-five grand
just to show up,</i>

01:21:58.226 --> 01:22:00.897
<i>and another 150 grand
to the winner.</i>

01:22:00.930 --> 01:22:02.531
We got a fight.

01:22:05.467 --> 01:22:07.536
Hey, who's the man of the
house while daddy's gone?

01:22:07.569 --> 01:22:09.538
- I am.
- That's right.

01:22:09.571 --> 01:22:13.575
So, anything Granny Taco needs,
you make sure she's okay.

01:22:13.609 --> 01:22:14.677
Yes, sir.

01:22:14.711 --> 01:22:15.878
And you be a gentleman,

01:22:15.912 --> 01:22:17.579
and pay attention to her, okay?

01:22:17.613 --> 01:22:20.182
- Okay.
- It's only five days.

01:22:20.215 --> 01:22:22.150
So I'll be back
before you know it.

01:22:22.184 --> 01:22:24.353
And you know what?
Daddy's flying again.

01:22:24.386 --> 01:22:25.855
So maybe I'll talk
to the pilot

01:22:25.888 --> 01:22:27.724
and see if I can
bring you back some wings.

01:22:31.928 --> 01:22:33.428
I love you, dude.

01:22:33.462 --> 01:22:34.897
I love you, too.

01:22:38.433 --> 01:22:39.936
<i>Needless to say,</i>

01:22:39.969 --> 01:22:41.704
<i>after 30 days of hard training,</i>

01:22:41.738 --> 01:22:44.406
<i>we were on a plane
headed right back to Dubai.</i>

01:22:45.942 --> 01:22:47.342
I couldn't believe Mason

01:22:47.376 --> 01:22:48.711
even agreed to let
Blaine fight,

01:22:48.745 --> 01:22:51.246
but I guess at his core,

01:22:51.279 --> 01:22:52.614
he's just a fan
like the rest of us,

01:22:52.648 --> 01:22:54.616
and, you know,

01:22:54.650 --> 01:22:56.251
he wanted to see who'd win.

01:23:00.455 --> 01:23:05.762
<i>So, to keep it quiet,
he said 100 lucky witnesses max,</i>

01:23:05.795 --> 01:23:10.332
<i>and that all attendees would have
their lips permanently sealed.</i>

01:23:10.365 --> 01:23:12.234
Ah! Welcome back to Dubai.

01:23:12.267 --> 01:23:14.369
I appreciate the opportunity,
Mr. Kostopoulos.

01:23:14.403 --> 01:23:16.271
Nice to see you again,
my friend.

01:23:16.304 --> 01:23:18.573
Wonderful to see you
too, sir.

01:23:18.607 --> 01:23:20.642
Again, thank you for the
hospitality with my friend.

01:23:20.677 --> 01:23:23.278
Think nothing of it, Mickey.
I would have thrown the fight myself

01:23:23.311 --> 01:23:24.579
if I would've known
you'd still be interested.

01:23:24.613 --> 01:23:27.784
Are you joking?
He is stubborn.

01:23:27.817 --> 01:23:29.484
I saw it seven years ago.

01:23:29.518 --> 01:23:31.453
Doesn't know
when he's beaten.

01:23:31.486 --> 01:23:35.792
Now he comes here to risk
his health for only $75,000.

01:23:35.825 --> 01:23:38.660
Is that the worth
of a man's health in America?

01:23:38.695 --> 01:23:42.631
You care for a dollar
like I care for a million.

01:23:42.664 --> 01:23:45.333
At least Marco,
he bargained with me a little bit.

01:23:45.367 --> 01:23:48.905
I got him for 100,000,
and when he wins the extra 150,000,

01:23:48.938 --> 01:23:51.941
he's going to buy
a Ferrari Maranello.

01:23:51.974 --> 01:23:55.644
This is what you are to him,
a new car.

01:23:57.847 --> 01:23:59.782
Ah! He is also ready.

01:24:09.424 --> 01:24:10.793
Mick, you good?

01:24:12.762 --> 01:24:14.362
Yeah, I'm good.

01:24:14.396 --> 01:24:20.335
Weighing in at 168 lbs,
Mickey Kelley!

01:24:21.470 --> 01:24:22.471
Yeah, baby.

01:24:22.504 --> 01:24:24.907
And his opponent...

01:24:27.844 --> 01:24:32.280
weighing in at 170.9 lbs,

01:24:32.314 --> 01:24:34.917
Marco Blaine!

01:24:36.886 --> 01:24:38.286
They're talking
about you, champ.

01:24:42.557 --> 01:24:43.860
- Okay.
- No.

01:24:43.893 --> 01:24:47.596
These are the terms,
as agreed to by both camps.

01:24:47.629 --> 01:24:52.501
First, there will be no
biting, no headbutts.

01:24:52.534 --> 01:24:54.636
Mr. Kostopoulos
is taking wagers,

01:24:54.669 --> 01:24:56.038
if you are so inclined,
gentlemen.

01:24:56.072 --> 01:25:00.475
- I am so inclined. You?
- Yeah.

01:25:00.509 --> 01:25:03.512
...if the opponent
has a hand on the mat.

01:25:03.545 --> 01:25:04.881
Anything else you need,
princess?

01:25:04.914 --> 01:25:06.581
Maybe some knee pads.
What's up?

01:25:09.819 --> 01:25:12.420
Okay, gentleman.
We will see you tonight.

01:25:13.956 --> 01:25:16.926
Bin Khalid
thinks you are brave.

01:25:16.959 --> 01:25:19.427
But I know the truth.

01:25:19.461 --> 01:25:22.765
You are not brave,
you are stupid.

01:25:22.799 --> 01:25:25.968
What really makes you
think you can win?

01:25:26.002 --> 01:25:28.470
I'm gonna make him quit.

01:25:28.503 --> 01:25:31.506
You see, God, or Allah,

01:25:31.540 --> 01:25:32.909
or whatever
you want to call him?

01:25:32.942 --> 01:25:34.677
He's got a message
for all athletes

01:25:34.710 --> 01:25:36.078
that get pushed far enough,

01:25:36.112 --> 01:25:37.914
and he delivers it
through lactic acid.

01:25:37.947 --> 01:25:39.749
It's a by-product
of muscle use.

01:25:39.782 --> 01:25:42.084
Hell, it makes standing
even almost unbearable.

01:25:42.118 --> 01:25:43.853
It's his way of saying
that your organs

01:25:43.886 --> 01:25:46.555
are gonna completely shut down
if you keep pushing yourself.

01:25:46.588 --> 01:25:49.457
Well, your boy,
when God talks to him,

01:25:49.491 --> 01:25:50.993
I'm bettin'
he's gonna listen.

01:25:52.028 --> 01:25:53.095
And what about you?

01:25:57.632 --> 01:25:59.568
I quit listening to God
six months ago.

01:26:01.103 --> 01:26:03.338
- You ready?
- Yeah, let's get out of here.

01:26:07.877 --> 01:26:11.013
See him? I see him.

01:26:14.083 --> 01:26:16.418
What is it?

01:26:16.451 --> 01:26:17.652
Kelley.

01:26:19.021 --> 01:26:20.455
That's not his name.

01:26:26.628 --> 01:26:30.599
And now, hailing
from the United States,

01:26:30.632 --> 01:26:33.535
in only his fourth
professional fight,

01:26:33.568 --> 01:26:36.571
Marine Corps veteran
and jiu-jitsu instructor,

01:26:36.605 --> 01:26:38.875
Mickey Kelley!

01:27:07.169 --> 01:27:08.771
How you doing, son?

01:27:10.907 --> 01:27:12.808
Sit down. Sit down, here.

01:27:12.842 --> 01:27:14.542
You're about to go to work.

01:27:15.878 --> 01:27:18.480
I'm Dick Mason.

01:27:18.513 --> 01:27:19.982
I'm the guy that, uh,

01:27:20.016 --> 01:27:22.484
tried to put this fight
together the first time.

01:27:22.517 --> 01:27:23.686
The right way.

01:27:25.254 --> 01:27:26.822
Apologies.

01:27:26.856 --> 01:27:29.992
Medical exam,
it was out of my hands.

01:27:31.193 --> 01:27:33.461
Marine, huh?

01:27:33.495 --> 01:27:36.065
I was a commanding officer
myself during the Gulf War.

01:27:37.767 --> 01:27:41.971
I only lost one marine
under my eye the whole time.

01:27:44.173 --> 01:27:47.743
That low number didn't
make it any better, though.

01:27:47.777 --> 01:27:51.847
His Abrams rolled over
a pissant IED near Kirkuk,

01:27:51.881 --> 01:27:54.083
the c-track de-wheeled.

01:27:54.116 --> 01:27:58.220
He was an engineer,
just like myself when I enlisted.

01:27:58.254 --> 01:28:02.892
He did his job to perfection.
He got out of that tank.

01:28:02.925 --> 01:28:04.659
He almost fixed that shit...

01:28:05.928 --> 01:28:07.730
'til a sniper found him.

01:28:10.232 --> 01:28:11.867
Ear to ear.

01:28:14.203 --> 01:28:16.205
Dropped him on the spot.

01:28:18.640 --> 01:28:20.876
His best friend
since he was in boot

01:28:20.910 --> 01:28:23.545
was in the tank with him,
a guy named O'Sullivan.

01:28:25.613 --> 01:28:29.018
Crew was ordered to evac,
the whole battalion was re-routed.

01:28:30.853 --> 01:28:34.123
When they came under
a gun and mortar fire,

01:28:34.156 --> 01:28:37.059
everyone obeyed,
except for O'Sullivan.

01:28:38.060 --> 01:28:39.695
You know, it turns out

01:28:39.729 --> 01:28:42.164
you never know
what a man's capable of

01:28:42.198 --> 01:28:44.100
until you look him in the eye.

01:28:45.868 --> 01:28:48.070
But he waited there
for two days,

01:28:48.104 --> 01:28:51.807
guarding his best friend's body
until it could be extracted.

01:28:51.841 --> 01:28:56.846
Did it all with a sidearm,
a pistol, mind you.

01:28:56.879 --> 01:29:00.182
A damn pistol.

01:29:00.216 --> 01:29:03.019
When they asked him
why he did it after the fact,

01:29:03.052 --> 01:29:06.689
he stood in front
of this debrief panel

01:29:06.722 --> 01:29:10.326
under threat of a DD
and he told them,

01:29:10.359 --> 01:29:13.095
"Because the job
wasn't done yet."

01:29:14.662 --> 01:29:17.099
Really wish I could've
looked that fella in the eye

01:29:17.133 --> 01:29:18.934
before I called that pull.

01:29:21.137 --> 01:29:22.938
Now, once the story got out,

01:29:22.972 --> 01:29:24.840
all the bigwigs
back in Washington,

01:29:24.874 --> 01:29:27.176
they wanted to throw
a medal at him.

01:29:27.209 --> 01:29:29.945
I wanted to meet him myself
for my own reasons.

01:29:31.180 --> 01:29:33.749
But we couldn't find him.

01:29:33.783 --> 01:29:36.318
Apparently,
he changed his name.

01:29:37.720 --> 01:29:39.855
You ever hear
that story before, son?

01:30:04.747 --> 01:30:07.649
I always wanted
to meet the man

01:30:07.683 --> 01:30:10.119
that carried my son
off that field.

01:30:18.194 --> 01:30:21.897
<i>Semper Fidelis,</i>
Sergeant O'Sullivan.

01:30:26.435 --> 01:30:27.970
Godspeed.

01:31:03.072 --> 01:31:04.639
Here we go.

01:31:08.043 --> 01:31:09.245
We have it. We're good.

01:31:20.089 --> 01:31:23.058
Whoo! He looks good.
He looks good!

01:31:23.092 --> 01:31:25.094
We're gonna make
so much money

01:31:25.127 --> 01:31:27.163
betting against these idiots!

01:31:27.196 --> 01:31:29.431
Hell, Vegas is gonna die
for these odds.

01:31:32.201 --> 01:31:35.437
Taco, look, wearing
a frickin' sherpa.

01:31:42.378 --> 01:31:45.247
This is amazing, bro.
Rematch of the century.

01:31:45.281 --> 01:31:47.383
Ladies and
gentlemen, welcome to the fight

01:31:47.416 --> 01:31:49.818
that everyone asked for,
only made possible

01:31:49.852 --> 01:31:52.154
- by the Pope of Al Nasser Square...
- Here you go, over here.

01:31:52.188 --> 01:31:54.423
...Mr. Dimitris Kostopoulos.

01:31:58.961 --> 01:32:01.330
Now, without further ado,

01:32:01.363 --> 01:32:04.333
a man that needs
no introduction.

01:32:04.366 --> 01:32:09.471
From Brazil, the undefeated VTC
welterweight champion,

01:32:09.505 --> 01:32:11.740
Marco Blaine!

01:32:20.549 --> 01:32:21.817
- Use your head.
- It's time, baby.

01:32:21.850 --> 01:32:23.085
Use your head now, hmm?

01:32:23.118 --> 01:32:24.253
Time to execute.

01:32:29.491 --> 01:32:30.793
Come on.

01:32:32.294 --> 01:32:36.098
His opponent,
hailing from the United States,

01:32:36.131 --> 01:32:39.268
unknown to most,
but celebrated by many,

01:32:39.301 --> 01:32:43.839
a jiu-jitsu fighter and US Marine
corps combatives instructor,

01:32:43.872 --> 01:32:48.944
with only three known fights and a
record of two wins and one loss...

01:32:48.978 --> 01:32:51.413
Mickey Kelley!

01:33:01.957 --> 01:33:04.159
- Let's go to work, baby.
- All right, listen, Mick.

01:33:04.193 --> 01:33:06.962
You're better than this guy.
I know that, and you know that.

01:33:06.996 --> 01:33:08.163
You have nothing to prove.

01:33:08.197 --> 01:33:09.465
If something
doesn't feel right,

01:33:09.498 --> 01:33:11.166
let's get out of there
safe, okay?

01:33:17.239 --> 01:33:18.907
So watch that thick skull
of yours.

01:33:21.010 --> 01:33:23.145
I'm gonna go over there,
say hi to him.

01:33:24.146 --> 01:33:26.348
Mick, Mick, Mick.

01:33:26.382 --> 01:33:27.516
<i>Oha,</i> Mickey.

01:33:27.549 --> 01:33:29.018
I wouldn't miss this.

01:33:29.051 --> 01:33:31.353
Good luck, man.
Good to be here.

01:33:33.422 --> 01:33:35.557
Professor Renzo.

01:33:45.100 --> 01:33:46.235
I'm good.

01:33:46.268 --> 01:33:48.570
Turn around, Mick.
It's time. Let's go.

01:33:50.539 --> 01:33:51.473
Gentlemen.

01:33:57.646 --> 01:33:59.248
You know the rules.

01:33:59.281 --> 01:34:01.417
Obey me at all times.

01:34:01.450 --> 01:34:03.886
Protect yourselves
at all times.

01:34:03.919 --> 01:34:07.256
I want a clean fight.
Understood?

01:34:07.289 --> 01:34:09.591
If you want to shake hands,
do it now.

01:34:10.993 --> 01:34:12.461
To your corners.

01:34:12.494 --> 01:34:13.929
Thirty seconds, bro.

01:34:13.962 --> 01:34:15.497
If he doesn't get Marco
down in 30 seconds,

01:34:15.531 --> 01:34:16.865
it's no good.

01:34:16.899 --> 01:34:18.367
- Let's go, baby.
- All right.

01:34:18.400 --> 01:34:20.135
- Go to work.
- He looks good.

01:34:22.971 --> 01:34:24.440
Ready?

01:34:26.275 --> 01:34:27.276
Begin.

01:34:35.984 --> 01:34:37.386
- Yes!
- That's what you want!

01:34:37.419 --> 01:34:40.155
That's what you want, baby!
Yes, sir!

01:34:40.189 --> 01:34:41.523
Bring him down!

01:34:43.425 --> 01:34:44.660
Protect, baby! Protect!

01:34:44.694 --> 01:34:46.295
Yep. Here you go!

01:34:46.328 --> 01:34:48.564
There you go, bring him...
bring him down!

01:34:48.597 --> 01:34:50.566
Twelve seconds!
He got him down in 12 seconds!

01:34:50.599 --> 01:34:52.134
Your world, baby!
Your world!

01:34:54.236 --> 01:34:55.437
Make him pay!

01:34:58.207 --> 01:34:59.341
Nice!

01:34:59.375 --> 01:35:00.609
There you go!

01:35:00.642 --> 01:35:03.445
Here we go!
Here we go!

01:35:03.479 --> 01:35:05.080
- There you go, Mick!
- Give it to him! Give it to him!

01:35:06.716 --> 01:35:08.484
Give it to him!

01:35:08.517 --> 01:35:10.352
Yes! Yes, that's the sequence
right there. Yeah.

01:35:10.386 --> 01:35:12.121
- Here we go!
- Yes, yes!

01:35:12.154 --> 01:35:14.356
- Squeeze! Squeeze!
- Lock him! Lock him up!

01:35:14.390 --> 01:35:16.024
Go! Go! Go!
Go! Go! Squeeze!

01:35:18.427 --> 01:35:20.062
You got him!

01:35:21.530 --> 01:35:22.931
He can't move! Break!

01:35:22.965 --> 01:35:24.233
Break!

01:35:24.266 --> 01:35:26.535
Whoa! What are you doing?
He had him!

01:35:26.568 --> 01:35:29.104
- What are you doing?
- No headbutts.

01:35:29.138 --> 01:35:30.272
Dammit,
the fight was over!

01:35:30.305 --> 01:35:31.206
To your corners!

01:35:32.508 --> 01:35:34.610
- This is bullshit!
- Go see your cornerman!

01:35:34.643 --> 01:35:36.679
- Come here! Fucking pussy!
- He had him!

01:35:36.713 --> 01:35:38.247
No wonder they didn't wanna be on camera!
Let me see your face!

01:35:38.280 --> 01:35:39.515
- Hey, one warning only.
- You're fine.

01:35:39.548 --> 01:35:40.949
You're fine.
He's good. He's good.

01:35:40.983 --> 01:35:42.451
- You're good.
- You're good, Mick.

01:35:42.484 --> 01:35:45.120
Next violation,
you'll be disqualified.

01:35:49.491 --> 01:35:51.226
Fighters, ready?

01:35:51.260 --> 01:35:52.561
No! Start him on the ground!

01:35:54.029 --> 01:35:55.698
- Fighters, begin.
- On the ground!

01:35:55.732 --> 01:35:58.200
No! No! No!

01:36:02.004 --> 01:36:03.405
Dammit!

01:36:03.439 --> 01:36:05.240
- Make him pay.
- Cover your face, Mick!

01:36:05.274 --> 01:36:06.676
Get up, baby! Get up!

01:36:06.709 --> 01:36:08.243
Get up!

01:36:08.277 --> 01:36:09.978
Back away!

01:36:10.012 --> 01:36:11.280
There you go!

01:36:12.782 --> 01:36:13.750
- Come on!
- Get up!

01:36:13.783 --> 01:36:16.151
- Get up!
- Really?

01:36:16.185 --> 01:36:17.553
On your feet!

01:36:19.154 --> 01:36:20.489
Fight.

01:36:20.522 --> 01:36:22.558
- Defense.
- Cover up, Mick!

01:36:22.591 --> 01:36:24.426
Cover up, Mick!
Mick, chin down!

01:36:24.460 --> 01:36:25.527
Chin down, Mick!

01:36:27.797 --> 01:36:29.031
Guard, baby! Guard!

01:36:31.300 --> 01:36:33.770
Here it comes, baby!

01:36:38.073 --> 01:36:40.275
- Yes!
- That's it, baby!

01:36:43.813 --> 01:36:46.048
- He's hurt, baby! He's hurt!
- Yes! Yes!

01:36:48.217 --> 01:36:49.318
Here you go!

01:36:53.455 --> 01:36:54.724
Now he wants to take it
to the ground?

01:36:54.757 --> 01:36:56.124
You see his legs buckle?
He rocked him, baby!

01:36:56.158 --> 01:36:57.526
Yes, your world! Give it!

01:36:57.559 --> 01:36:59.061
Work the guard right there,
that's right.

01:36:59.094 --> 01:37:02.397
- Work the guard!
- Cover up, Mick!

01:37:02.431 --> 01:37:04.566
- Control him! Posture!
- Cover up! Cover up!

01:37:04.600 --> 01:37:05.601
Control
his posture, Mick!

01:37:05.634 --> 01:37:07.402
Control that!

01:37:09.471 --> 01:37:10.472
- Cover up, Mick!
- Defense!

01:37:10.506 --> 01:37:11.741
Cover up, Mick!

01:37:11.774 --> 01:37:14.643
Don't go! Don't go!

01:37:14.677 --> 01:37:17.446
Defense!

01:37:17.479 --> 01:37:20.215
Turn your head!
Get the hook!

01:37:20.249 --> 01:37:21.784
Grab his arm!
Grab his arm!

01:37:21.818 --> 01:37:23.452
Grab his arm!
There you go!

01:37:23.485 --> 01:37:25.187
Keep it going!
You got it!

01:37:25.220 --> 01:37:26.421
Turn him!

01:37:29.525 --> 01:37:31.460
Go! Go! Go!

01:37:31.493 --> 01:37:32.695
Stay-stay heavy!

01:37:43.539 --> 01:37:44.406
Come on!

01:37:47.209 --> 01:37:48.310
Triangle! There you go.

01:37:48.343 --> 01:37:49.846
- Grab him!
- There you go!

01:37:49.879 --> 01:37:52.080
- Turn him!
- Yes!

01:38:00.355 --> 01:38:01.657
- There it is!
- Let's go!

01:38:01.691 --> 01:38:03.525
- Nice! Nice!
- Very nice!

01:38:15.738 --> 01:38:18.407
- Motherfuck!
- Break!

01:38:26.515 --> 01:38:27.817
He looks really bad.

01:38:28.818 --> 01:38:30.185
Shit.

01:39:10.693 --> 01:39:12.561
You're good.

01:39:12.594 --> 01:39:16.164
- What's wrong?
- He can't see. At all.

01:39:16.198 --> 01:39:18.801
It's just white streaks.

01:39:18.835 --> 01:39:21.203
Mick, we're gonna have
to throw in the towel.

01:39:21.236 --> 01:39:22.204
We can't.

01:39:22.237 --> 01:39:24.172
What do you mean, we can't?

01:39:25.875 --> 01:39:27.509
Mr. Kostopoulos...

01:39:28.711 --> 01:39:29.846
You know, I thought
about what you said.

01:39:29.879 --> 01:39:32.414
You know, Marco wants a car.

01:39:32.447 --> 01:39:34.349
Well, I want something, too.

01:39:34.383 --> 01:39:37.285
I want a house and an
education for my kid.

01:39:37.319 --> 01:39:40.222
That's nice,
but you cannot win.

01:39:40.255 --> 01:39:44.192
You know, you say a dollar to me
is like a million to you.

01:39:44.226 --> 01:39:46.361
I can't argue with that.

01:39:46.395 --> 01:39:48.865
So I got
a proposition for you.

01:39:48.898 --> 01:39:50.867
Why don't you
keep your 75 grand?

01:39:50.900 --> 01:39:53.568
I'll show up
tomorrow for free.

01:39:53.602 --> 01:39:57.572
But, if I happen to win,
you give me that million.

01:40:01.476 --> 01:40:03.245
I trust your word's good?

01:40:07.516 --> 01:40:10.687
Bin Khalid
thinks you are brave,

01:40:10.720 --> 01:40:12.421
but I know the truth.

01:40:12.454 --> 01:40:16.425
You're not brave,
you are stupid.

01:40:16.458 --> 01:40:18.895
What really makes you
think you can win?

01:40:18.928 --> 01:40:20.462
It's all or nothing.

01:40:20.495 --> 01:40:22.631
You stupid fucking hick,
Mick!

01:40:22.664 --> 01:40:25.267
I may have to eat
a few punches to get to him,

01:40:25.300 --> 01:40:28.905
but if you can guide me to
him, I can submit him.

01:40:28.938 --> 01:40:30.740
- Mick...
- Listen to me.

01:40:30.773 --> 01:40:32.674
I had my head on his chest.

01:40:32.709 --> 01:40:35.644
It's all tweeter.
There's no bass.

01:40:36.645 --> 01:40:38.246
He's gonna quit.

01:40:38.280 --> 01:40:40.449
I swear to God,
he's gonna quit.

01:40:40.482 --> 01:40:42.752
All right,
you guys. Stool out.

01:40:42.785 --> 01:40:44.921
I'm gonna guide you
through this thing.

01:40:44.954 --> 01:40:47.522
But you're gonna have
to listen for my voice, okay?

01:40:47.556 --> 01:40:49.959
Layla's gonna be for left,
Kyd's gonna be for right.

01:40:49.992 --> 01:40:50.927
All right?

01:40:54.529 --> 01:40:56.264
Three steps straight out.

01:40:56.298 --> 01:40:58.667
Ready? Begin.

01:40:58.701 --> 01:41:01.269
Hands up, baby.
Hands up. Hands up. Let's go.

01:41:02.537 --> 01:41:03.538
Hands up, hands up,
hands up.

01:41:03.572 --> 01:41:04.506
Hands up, baby. Hands up.

01:41:04.539 --> 01:41:05.942
Layla. Layla. Layla.

01:41:05.975 --> 01:41:07.877
Layla.
Layla. Layla.

01:41:07.910 --> 01:41:09.478
Layla. Layla. Layla.

01:41:09.511 --> 01:41:10.847
- Clear that space, baby.
- Here you go.

01:41:12.314 --> 01:41:14.282
- Shit.
- Here comes another one.

01:41:16.618 --> 01:41:19.021
- Distance, distance.
- Ah.

01:41:19.055 --> 01:41:21.389
Clear that space, baby.
She's close. Attack. Attack.

01:41:22.792 --> 01:41:24.060
Put those hands up, baby.

01:41:24.093 --> 01:41:25.360
- Put 'em up. Watch it!
- Kyd, Kyd, Kyd, Kyd!

01:41:25.393 --> 01:41:27.997
Hands up, Mick!

01:41:28.030 --> 01:41:28.931
Attack.

01:41:30.599 --> 01:41:32.969
Put your hands up, Mick.

01:41:33.002 --> 01:41:34.904
Watch out, Mick!
Hands up! Hands up!

01:41:34.937 --> 01:41:36.739
Close it!
He's closing it!

01:41:40.442 --> 01:41:41.878
Stop him! Stop him! Stop him!

01:41:41.911 --> 01:41:45.848
Okay. It's okay.
Kyd. Kyd. Kyd. Kyd.

01:41:45.882 --> 01:41:47.649
Come on. Come on, Mickey!

01:41:47.683 --> 01:41:48.951
- Up, up, up!
- Let's go, baby! Six feet away!

01:41:48.985 --> 01:41:51.319
- Six feet away!
- On your feet.

01:41:51.353 --> 01:41:52.654
- Breathe, baby, breathe.
- He's right in front of you.

01:41:52.688 --> 01:41:55.423
Layla! Layla, Mick.
Layla! Layla, Mick.

01:42:11.640 --> 01:42:12.809
Come on, Mickey!

01:42:31.861 --> 01:42:34.563
Get up, Mick.

01:42:34.596 --> 01:42:35.832
Mick, I'm gonna have
to throw in the towel

01:42:35.865 --> 01:42:36.866
if you don't get up.
Get up!

01:42:36.899 --> 01:42:37.967
You gotta get up, Mick!

01:42:41.503 --> 01:42:44.372
I love you a whole lot!

01:42:44.406 --> 01:42:45.775
You love me.

01:42:49.779 --> 01:42:50.913
What about our prayers?

01:42:52.682 --> 01:42:54.917
<i>Angel of God,
my guardian dear,</i>

01:42:54.951 --> 01:42:57.452
<i>to whom God's love
commits me here.</i>

01:42:57.485 --> 01:42:59.922
<i>Watch over me
throughout the night,</i>

01:42:59.956 --> 01:43:01.590
<i>and keep me safe
within your sight.</i>

01:43:01.623 --> 01:43:03.860
I need to stop
this thing, Mick.

01:43:05.995 --> 01:43:07.395
Hey, God bless you, Mick!

01:43:13.736 --> 01:43:14.937
Come on!

01:43:14.971 --> 01:43:16.605
- Cover up, Mick!
- There you go!

01:43:16.638 --> 01:43:18.473
Come on!

01:43:18.506 --> 01:43:19.374
Yes!

01:43:28.516 --> 01:43:30.753
Take the back!
Why is he not taking the back?

01:43:32.088 --> 01:43:33.723
He's taking him over the top!

01:43:46.468 --> 01:43:47.469
Finish him, Mick!

01:43:50.907 --> 01:43:53.608
Why is he not taking it?

01:43:53.642 --> 01:43:55.610
He's hiding his hands
so he can't tap out.

01:43:55.644 --> 01:43:57.079
Yes, fuck this guy, Mick!

01:44:05.888 --> 01:44:07.422
Fuck him! Yes!

01:44:15.798 --> 01:44:17.833
He's out! It's over!

01:44:17.867 --> 01:44:21.804
The winner is Mickey Kelley!

01:44:21.837 --> 01:44:23.571
Yes!

01:44:43.993 --> 01:44:45.493
What the hell
you so happy about?

01:44:46.594 --> 01:44:47.930
Wait, you changed your bet?

01:44:47.964 --> 01:44:50.066
I looked in his eyes.

01:44:50.099 --> 01:44:54.569
I haven't seen that kind of
conviction since Zaire 1974.

01:44:54.602 --> 01:44:56.038
Get in there!
Get your man!

01:44:57.807 --> 01:44:59.742
Mick, you did it!

01:45:04.180 --> 01:45:09.118
<i>Marco went back to
Brazil and never fought again.</i>

01:45:09.151 --> 01:45:14.023
<i>Mickey... Mickey was
rushed to the hospital.</i>

01:45:14.056 --> 01:45:17.093
<i>Doctors found cerebral swelling
due to the hits he took.</i>

01:45:18.294 --> 01:45:20.595
<i>They had to induce a coma.</i>

01:45:29.305 --> 01:45:31.040
Where's my daddy?

01:45:33.809 --> 01:45:36.012
<i>Getting out
of that cab alone</i>

01:45:36.045 --> 01:45:38.214
<i>was one of the most difficult
things</i>

01:45:38.247 --> 01:45:40.216
<i>I'd ever done in my life.</i>

01:45:50.860 --> 01:45:53.829
If this
all really happened,

01:45:53.863 --> 01:45:56.766
why did we never
hear about it?

01:45:56.799 --> 01:46:00.870
The fight happened
on September 1st, 2001.

01:46:05.374 --> 01:46:08.010
Ten days after that,
nothing really mattered.

01:46:17.686 --> 01:46:20.056
You know, we went down
to Carvell cemetery,

01:46:20.089 --> 01:46:25.194
and we saw Layla's grave,
but we didn't see Mickey's.

01:46:51.887 --> 01:46:52.988
Hey, yo, Mick!

01:46:53.022 --> 01:46:55.623
You got company.
Go ahead, man.

01:46:59.328 --> 01:47:00.763
They fit.

01:47:12.308 --> 01:47:14.410
Okay.

01:47:14.443 --> 01:47:16.178
But we never start 'em.

01:47:17.980 --> 01:47:19.281
We just finish 'em.
