00:24.089 --> 00:26.992
What I'm just finding out
is that both my exes picked me

00:27.025 --> 00:28.894
for things on their list
other than sex.

00:28.928 --> 00:31.431
- Like what?
- Like Housing and Safety.

00:36.902 --> 00:38.503
Do you cook for him?

00:38.536 --> 00:40.772
I will never cook for a man,
never!

00:40.805 --> 00:43.375
He asks me to cook,
I call the cops.

00:45.076 --> 00:47.713
We get along great,
I'm just not attracted to her.

00:47.746 --> 00:50.416
We have great sex,
I just can't stand him.

00:56.554 --> 00:58.557
He wanted to kiss me
under my arms.

00:58.591 --> 00:59.692
Gross!

00:59.725 --> 01:01.761
He said it was
a very exciting place for him.

01:01.793 --> 01:03.695
Lick my pits!

01:03.728 --> 01:05.798
Nobody's ever licked my pits.

01:05.831 --> 01:07.933
- Underarms!
- Gross!

01:12.070 --> 01:13.972
I don't mind older men.

01:18.243 --> 01:19.978
Jacking off is not cardio!

01:20.012 --> 01:21.213
Good morning, Carl?

01:24.516 --> 01:25.817
Her feet!

01:25.850 --> 01:27.920
Oh my God,
you should see her feet!

01:27.953 --> 01:30.055
Her toes are like teeth!

01:30.088 --> 01:31.456
Does it taste like peppermint?

01:31.489 --> 01:33.325
- Is that what he said?
- That's what he wanted to know.

01:33.358 --> 01:35.227
- And what did you say?
- Salted caramel.

01:35.260 --> 01:37.496
- And what did he say?
- Said he'd give it a try.

01:37.530 --> 01:39.298
And what did you say?

01:44.703 --> 01:48.573
What both sides wish for
is a home, a nest,

01:48.606 --> 01:50.308
a life with another.

02:00.718 --> 02:03.355
He turns off the heat,
I turn it back on.

02:03.388 --> 02:06.358
He turns off the lights,
I turn them back on!

02:06.391 --> 02:07.659
Rae!

02:15.533 --> 02:17.769
The blinds, I open them,
he shuts them.

02:17.802 --> 02:20.139
- Rae!
- We just keep un-doing

02:20.171 --> 02:22.542
each other all day long,
every day,

02:22.574 --> 02:25.277
day after day,
all of it just unravels!

02:25.311 --> 02:26.778
Rae!

02:41.060 --> 02:43.962
I could love more than one man
at the same time.

02:44.997 --> 02:46.666
Same day, no problem.

03:06.752 --> 03:07.987
It's all about touch!

03:08.020 --> 03:09.921
Now, who is gonna touch me?

03:09.955 --> 03:11.991
That is my question
to the universe.

03:12.024 --> 03:15.561
- It's like you don't exist.
- It's like you don't exist.

04:22.961 --> 04:27.233
Man, alone,
walking in the desert.

04:27.266 --> 04:30.036
No, man is alone.

04:31.202 --> 04:34.339
He walks in the desert
of his desires.

04:36.040 --> 04:37.910
They are hot

04:37.942 --> 04:40.779
and all around him like the sun.

04:42.781 --> 04:46.819
And he cannot escape,
and he cannot see.

04:46.851 --> 04:49.788
He is blinded
by these fantasies.

04:51.656 --> 04:54.459
They make him thirsty,

04:54.492 --> 04:58.430
yet they do not satisfy
his thirst.

04:58.463 --> 05:03.101
They bring him to his knees,
yet he gets up again and walks.

05:03.134 --> 05:05.170
Where is he walking?

05:05.204 --> 05:07.372
He walks in their direction.

05:08.973 --> 05:11.043
They lead him,

05:11.076 --> 05:14.814
and he obeys by following.

05:16.482 --> 05:19.618
There is no destination,
only pursuit.

05:22.153 --> 05:24.790
His journey

05:24.822 --> 05:27.459
is one of secrecy...

05:29.327 --> 05:31.796
...and one of exposure.

05:34.266 --> 05:36.402
He will die of both.

05:38.237 --> 05:39.972
And women...

05:43.274 --> 05:45.644
It's the same for them too.

05:45.677 --> 05:46.979
Women, men.

05:49.014 --> 05:51.150
It's the same, really.

05:53.418 --> 05:55.487
There's no connection.

05:58.557 --> 06:00.759
It's broken.

06:00.793 --> 06:03.162
Do you know, in Miami Beach,
they don't even walk on their sidewalks?

06:03.194 --> 06:04.896
Do you know what they do?
They stroll.

06:04.930 --> 06:06.598
- They stroll?
- That's right, they stroll.

06:06.632 --> 06:08.667
Three or four of them
strung out across a sidewalk,

06:08.699 --> 06:11.269
taking up the whole thing,
maybe even one of them pushing a carriage.

06:11.302 --> 06:12.338
- What are they thinking?
- Nothing.

06:12.370 --> 06:13.838
- That's right.
- Not one thought in their heads.

06:13.872 --> 06:15.341
What are they, lost?
Who are these people?

06:15.374 --> 06:16.609
- It's not right, you know.
- No, it's not.

06:16.641 --> 06:18.009
- When you live among others.
- Yeah, yakking

06:18.043 --> 06:20.012
- the whole time too.
- About nothing.

06:28.286 --> 06:30.255
Tell you something else,
in Miami, they're fit.

06:30.288 --> 06:32.190
They exercise, and they look
good, they work at it.

06:32.223 --> 06:33.725
- So do we.
- No, but the difference is,

06:33.759 --> 06:35.194
if someone's running
in New York or LA,

06:35.226 --> 06:37.195
it's to make you think they're
better than you, but in Miami,

06:37.228 --> 06:39.264
they've got grease on,
I'm serious.

06:58.916 --> 07:00.118
It can't go on.

07:00.151 --> 07:01.454
It's gotta stop,

07:01.487 --> 07:03.389
otherwise you go crazy
and you start doing things.

07:03.422 --> 07:05.458
That's what's gonna happen
to me, I can see it.

07:05.490 --> 07:07.425
- Sexually insane.
- What?

07:07.459 --> 07:10.396
They don't even have hospitals
for this kind of thing, or jails.

07:10.428 --> 07:11.729
No, they pick you up

07:11.762 --> 07:14.098
and they drop you off
in the middle of nowhere,

07:14.132 --> 07:16.401
like animal control, yeah,
that's where I'm headed.

07:16.435 --> 07:17.903
I'm on the verge.

07:44.463 --> 07:46.866
I had this dream,
I was in a room full of Sirens.

07:46.899 --> 07:48.867
Sure, you're in a room full
of sirens right now, listen.

07:48.901 --> 07:50.269
No, I'm talking
about the other kind.

07:50.302 --> 07:51.670
You know, the Siren Sirens,

07:51.702 --> 07:52.971
- that kind.
- Same thing.

07:53.004 --> 07:54.772
That's all this city is,
a room full of Sirens.

07:54.805 --> 07:56.975
They're all over the place.
Go on, take your pick.

07:57.009 --> 07:58.610
What happens if you don't pick?

07:58.644 --> 07:59.978
You die with nothing.

08:00.012 --> 08:01.779
What happens if you do pick?

08:01.812 --> 08:03.615
You die sooner.

08:18.362 --> 08:20.298
I could be one of those guys
with three wives

08:20.331 --> 08:21.567
and three separate lives.

08:21.600 --> 08:23.469
I could do it.
You read about these guys.

08:23.502 --> 08:26.138
- How do they do it?
- They lie.

08:26.170 --> 08:27.473
Can you imagine the sort of lies

08:27.505 --> 08:30.308
you're gonna have to keep
coming up with nonstop?

08:32.177 --> 08:33.812
- I could do it though.
- No, you couldn't.

08:33.845 --> 08:35.648
- Three women?
- Minimum three.

08:35.681 --> 08:36.916
Be reasonable, make it two.

08:36.948 --> 08:38.650
Like in that story
of Tristan and Isolde.

08:38.683 --> 08:39.817
- You know that one?
- No.

08:39.850 --> 08:41.553
Well, anyway, there are
two different types of women

08:41.586 --> 08:43.489
in that story, and they both
have the same name, Isolde.

08:43.522 --> 08:44.990
- Isolde?
- Isolde.

08:45.023 --> 08:46.692
One was Isolde
of the Golden Hair

08:46.725 --> 08:48.326
and the other was Isolde
of the White Hands.

08:48.360 --> 08:49.495
This was in the paper?

08:49.528 --> 08:51.897
No, this is the 15th century,
Sir Thomas Malory.

08:51.929 --> 08:53.998
- What's the difference?
- About 600 years.

08:54.032 --> 08:56.569
No, between these two women,
the Isoldes, Hair and Hands.

08:56.601 --> 08:59.672
Big. Isolde of the Golden Hair,
she's the magic potion woman,

08:59.705 --> 09:01.674
and I'll get to that in
a minute, but she is the woman

09:01.706 --> 09:03.775
who will drive you mad
over the ends of the earth.

09:03.808 --> 09:06.010
She's the one you'll sacrifice
your sanity for,

09:06.043 --> 09:07.513
your well-being, your job,

09:07.546 --> 09:09.715
your fortune, your talent,
your whole purpose in life.

09:09.748 --> 09:11.917
She destroys you,
she kills you.

09:11.950 --> 09:13.419
She takes what you thought
you were

09:13.451 --> 09:14.687
and what you thought
you could achieve

09:14.720 --> 09:17.355
and what you thought you wanted,
and she sculpts it like wax

09:17.389 --> 09:19.191
to the exact image of her.

09:19.224 --> 09:20.893
And this is the one you want?

09:20.926 --> 09:22.194
She and nobody else.

09:22.226 --> 09:24.797
And what about the other one,
the one with the white hands?

09:24.830 --> 09:26.865
That's the one
you're married to.

09:26.898 --> 09:29.368
- What's she do?
- She keeps you alive.

09:40.011 --> 09:42.080
So who'd he pick?

09:42.114 --> 09:43.548
He didn't.

09:48.019 --> 09:51.222
He didn't?
He didn't make a choice?

09:51.255 --> 09:53.826
- Same, same.
- You got it.

09:53.859 --> 09:55.060
Choice was made.

09:55.092 --> 09:57.663
Now here's the bit
about the magic potion.

09:57.696 --> 10:00.766
Tristan was taking Isolde of the
Golden Hair back to King Mark

10:00.798 --> 10:02.167
to be his bride,
that was his mission,

10:02.200 --> 10:03.735
and on their way over,
they were on a boat,

10:03.769 --> 10:05.403
and a serving girl poured
this magic potion

10:05.437 --> 10:06.772
that she shouldn't have,
and they drank it,

10:06.804 --> 10:08.840
Tristan and Isolde,
and they fell in love,

10:08.874 --> 10:10.242
and of course,
that wasn't supposed to happen

10:10.274 --> 10:12.076
because Isolde of
the Golden Hair and King Mark

10:12.110 --> 10:13.946
were supposed to drink it
and solidify their union.

10:13.979 --> 10:15.080
And that's what did it?

10:15.113 --> 10:16.248
They had a drink?

10:16.280 --> 10:17.649
It wasn't just a drink.

10:17.682 --> 10:20.318
It was fate in liquid form.
They were transformed.

10:20.351 --> 10:22.086
Ah, but you're saying
no choice was made,

10:22.120 --> 10:23.922
or rather, a choice was made,
just not by them.

10:23.955 --> 10:25.157
No, they knew
what they were doing.

10:25.190 --> 10:26.659
They both wanted it
and they made the choice.

10:26.692 --> 10:28.293
I think choice
is really very reactive.

10:28.326 --> 10:29.995
I think we get it all wrong
by thinking that it's us

10:30.028 --> 10:31.797
that's making it happen,
'cause it isn't.

10:31.830 --> 10:33.799
- What is?
- It all adds up.

10:33.831 --> 10:35.801
That's all choice is,
it's an accumulation.

10:35.833 --> 10:37.468
We're there before we know
how we got there,

10:37.501 --> 10:38.603
and then you can't get out.

10:38.636 --> 10:39.937
- You can't?
- Nope.

10:39.971 --> 10:41.940
- What do you do?
- There's nothing you can do.

10:41.972 --> 10:44.275
You never made it
in the first place.

11:04.863 --> 11:07.232
- So you don't make a choice.
- Choice happens.

11:07.264 --> 11:09.333
You end up in one
from 30 years ago.

11:09.366 --> 11:11.135
- Who made it then?
- Who can remember?

11:11.168 --> 11:13.138
And by now, it's too late. Done.

11:13.171 --> 11:14.873
You think you know
when choices are made?

11:14.905 --> 11:17.075
Can you point to one time in
your life when you were making

11:17.109 --> 11:18.644
a choice and you knew
you were making a choice?

11:18.677 --> 11:20.546
I'm not talking about ordering
lunch or bringing an umbrella.

11:20.578 --> 11:21.979
I'm talking about one
that alters your life.

11:22.013 --> 11:23.382
Do you ever remember
doing that, ever?

11:23.414 --> 11:24.882
No, and that's what I'm saying.

11:24.916 --> 11:26.685
So much of life
is non-intentional.

11:26.717 --> 11:28.187
We don't see it happening.

11:28.220 --> 11:31.423
We react years later
to what we did years earlier,

11:31.456 --> 11:33.658
and choices are made internally.

11:33.692 --> 11:34.826
That's why we don't know,

11:34.860 --> 11:36.995
but they are happening
all around and all at once,

11:37.028 --> 11:38.096
and we don't even know.

11:38.129 --> 11:40.566
After the fact,
that is life, after the fact.

11:40.599 --> 11:42.234
Jeez, don't get me started.

11:42.267 --> 11:44.403
- I would've picked her too.
- No, you wouldn't.

11:44.436 --> 11:45.870
- Yes, I would've.
- No, you wouldn't.

11:45.903 --> 11:47.239
- Yes, I would've!
- No, you wouldn't!

11:47.272 --> 11:48.741
Had I the choice,
which I wouldn't,

11:48.774 --> 11:50.408
'cause it wouldn't have mattered
anyway, so.

11:50.442 --> 11:51.844
You stay away from her.

11:51.876 --> 11:53.377
Oh, no, the results
are the same.

11:53.410 --> 11:55.346
Heads, I don't make a choice,
and tails, it's fate.

11:55.379 --> 11:56.615
Either way, it's her.

11:56.648 --> 11:58.182
She will eat you alive.

11:58.216 --> 12:00.519
- So be it.
- You listen to me.

12:00.552 --> 12:01.687
You want the agony?

12:01.720 --> 12:03.021
'Cause she will float your brain

12:03.053 --> 12:04.523
like a cork down
the River Lagan.

12:04.556 --> 12:06.358
You think Mondays are bad?
Don't get me started.

12:06.390 --> 12:08.192
- You're not listening!
- I am not.

12:08.225 --> 12:10.195
They are restless souls,
these Sirens!

12:10.227 --> 12:12.396
You think you're gonna go home
and watch a movie with her?

12:12.429 --> 12:14.031
Heck, these creatures
are never still

12:14.065 --> 12:15.367
'cause they can never be still.

12:15.399 --> 12:17.269
And the past has torn them up,

12:17.302 --> 12:18.537
and they're always scrambling,

12:18.570 --> 12:19.738
they're gathering
all those wee pieces,

12:19.770 --> 12:21.539
but the wind is just
a little bit too strong,

12:21.572 --> 12:24.375
and those wee pieces are always
and forever out of their reach.

12:24.408 --> 12:25.711
Like little styrofoam peanuts.

12:25.744 --> 12:27.379
She'll keep you in pieces too.

12:27.412 --> 12:29.214
You'll start screaming
out of nowhere.

12:29.246 --> 12:30.716
Little styrofoam peanuts!

12:30.749 --> 12:32.918
Pieces that never fit together,
they never make a picture.

12:32.951 --> 12:34.119
She can't stay,
and then you're left

12:34.152 --> 12:35.487
with what won't satisfy you.

12:35.519 --> 12:37.990
She makes every other woman
look like a losing hand.

12:38.023 --> 12:39.892
Poor little Isolde
of the White Hands.

12:39.924 --> 12:41.225
Nobody ever wants to pick you.

12:41.259 --> 12:42.961
- Maybe you would.
- I would.

12:42.994 --> 12:44.897
- Maybe.
- I would pick her.

12:44.929 --> 12:46.330
Maybe you'd marry her.

12:46.364 --> 12:48.133
I'm getting married now?
I don't think so.

12:48.166 --> 12:50.736
- Oh, you'd marry her, if... if...
- If? If?

12:50.769 --> 12:53.471
If, if, if, if, if you like
knowing someone so much

12:53.504 --> 12:55.006
that you'd take off
all your layers

12:55.039 --> 12:56.307
and she takes off all hers,

12:56.341 --> 12:58.009
and then you win, and you lose,

12:58.043 --> 12:59.912
and you're a king,
and you're an asshole,

12:59.945 --> 13:01.246
and you're the guy in between.

13:01.278 --> 13:04.115
Familiarity, to have someone
know you all inside,

13:04.149 --> 13:06.018
and you know her that way too.

13:06.051 --> 13:08.921
- And you're loyal.
- Sounds like dogs.

13:08.953 --> 13:10.755
You're each other's dog.

13:10.788 --> 13:13.192
You play together,
you poop together,

13:13.225 --> 13:16.161
you stay warm together,
you lick together.

13:16.193 --> 13:17.762
She completes you.

13:17.796 --> 13:20.432
Well, I'm just waiting
to find somebody.

13:20.465 --> 13:22.000
Well, I'm waiting
to lose weight.

13:22.033 --> 13:23.769
The key to a man's
sexual vitality?

13:23.802 --> 13:24.937
Its in his waistline.

13:24.970 --> 13:26.772
That's the first place
in a man I look.

13:26.804 --> 13:29.440
Oh, well, you don't have to look
much further than right here,

13:29.474 --> 13:31.143
'cause I got
about three of them.

13:31.176 --> 13:34.146
Well, maybe I have to look
a little lower.

13:36.014 --> 13:37.316
What did I just say?

13:37.349 --> 13:39.350
Did you really just say that?

13:39.384 --> 13:40.552
Look at that.

13:40.585 --> 13:42.187
I wonder who's playing.

13:42.220 --> 13:44.456
Look at them.

13:44.489 --> 13:46.692
It's like a parade that stopped.

13:48.158 --> 13:49.628
They're all stuck.

13:49.660 --> 13:53.064
They're stuck in place
like their shoes are glued down.

13:53.097 --> 13:55.666
Nothing ever happens
to people in line.

13:55.700 --> 13:57.970
If you're in line,
you're out of life.

13:58.003 --> 14:00.639
Nothing will ever find you
when you're in line.

14:00.672 --> 14:03.475
Those people, those lives,

14:03.508 --> 14:05.310
wasted away.

14:05.342 --> 14:07.044
Gotta move!

14:07.077 --> 14:10.314
Gotta get out of line and stay
out, that's what you gotta do.

14:10.347 --> 14:12.250
Go let something happen to you.

14:12.283 --> 14:15.220
You wait in line, you're asking
for life not to happen, period.

14:15.253 --> 14:17.422
You're on the sidelines.

14:17.455 --> 14:19.324
You let it go too long,
you can't get it back.

14:19.356 --> 14:20.826
No, you've thrown yourself
on the fringe

14:20.859 --> 14:22.160
and you can't get it back.

14:22.192 --> 14:23.728
It's like quicksand.

14:23.761 --> 14:25.329
You sink.

14:25.363 --> 14:27.165
You gotta jump.

14:27.197 --> 14:29.433
If you don't, then what?

14:29.466 --> 14:30.769
You've done nothing
with your life.

14:30.802 --> 14:33.705
That's exactly what'll happen
if you don't jump. Nothing!

14:33.738 --> 14:35.741
What if it's their last chance
and they don't even know it?

14:35.774 --> 14:38.043
That's the way it is,
they made their choice.

14:38.076 --> 14:39.745
I thought you said
we don't make our choices.

14:39.778 --> 14:40.579
We don't.

14:40.611 --> 14:42.046
Being in line,
is that a choice?

14:42.080 --> 14:43.615
- They're waiting.
- Is it a choice?

14:43.648 --> 14:44.883
We can say they're
in transition.

14:44.916 --> 14:46.118
Or we can say they're stuck.

14:46.150 --> 14:48.586
They're here to see something,
man, this is just the meantime.

14:48.620 --> 14:50.054
So they're stuck
in the meantime.

14:50.087 --> 14:52.557
That's what you do when you're
on the way to your choice.

14:52.590 --> 14:55.793
That's where I always am,
I'm on the way to my choice.

14:55.826 --> 14:57.562
I can't believe this,
it's a myth.

14:57.595 --> 15:00.365
Those two women, the Isoldes,
they're myths,

15:00.398 --> 15:03.235
and all the women around us,
too, they're not real either.

15:03.268 --> 15:04.970
No, I'm surrounded by mythology.

15:05.003 --> 15:07.406
All I'm doing is just
chasing bubbles!

15:07.438 --> 15:10.308
Lie down now, brother,
that's all there is!

15:10.341 --> 15:12.543
Chase on,
run yourself ragged.

15:12.576 --> 15:13.946
That's where I'm stuck.

15:13.979 --> 15:16.882
I'm stuck in the chase, but I'm
not getting closer to anything.

15:16.914 --> 15:17.882
We're all on our way,

15:17.916 --> 15:19.484
and nobody's moving,
we're just stuck.

15:19.517 --> 15:21.787
We're stuck
like stupid stuck, stupid shite.

15:21.820 --> 15:23.221
Stupid stuck, stupid shite...

15:23.254 --> 15:26.325
How are you gonna get from here
to there if you don't make a move?

15:28.759 --> 15:30.562
Can't.

15:30.595 --> 15:32.598
Can't be done.

15:46.845 --> 15:49.581
How are you gonna chase
if you're stuck?

15:53.784 --> 15:56.187
You gotta bust it.

15:58.123 --> 15:59.458
Bust it?

16:02.559 --> 16:04.295
I'm gonna bust it.

16:05.629 --> 16:07.466
We gonna bust it?

16:10.301 --> 16:13.437
- You ready to jump?
- Hey, I'm ready to jump.

16:13.471 --> 16:15.273
- On three?
- Jumping.

16:15.306 --> 16:16.875
- One...
- Moving.

16:16.908 --> 16:18.442
- Two...
- Never stuck, never in line,

16:18.475 --> 16:19.845
- moving, jumping.
- Three!

16:19.878 --> 16:22.614
Bust it, bust it!

16:22.647 --> 16:25.617
She suggested I do
some manscaping.

16:25.649 --> 16:28.786
- How close are you cut?
- Are you in line or out of line?

16:28.820 --> 16:30.122
I'm sorry, say again, what?

16:30.154 --> 16:31.956
Do you already have your ticket?

16:31.990 --> 16:33.191
Yes, I do, I have them.

16:33.224 --> 16:35.794
Then you don't have to wait
in line, you can go right in,

16:35.826 --> 16:37.562
unless you're waiting
for someone.

16:37.595 --> 16:40.165
How many tickets do you have?

16:40.197 --> 16:41.399
Two.

16:41.432 --> 16:42.967
So do I,

16:43.999 --> 16:44.468
but I'm only using one.

16:44.501 --> 16:47.471
It was for my husband,
but we got into an argument.

16:47.504 --> 16:48.807
Your wife?

16:48.840 --> 16:50.375
Yes.

16:50.408 --> 16:53.979
And she has disappeared too.

16:54.011 --> 16:58.983
Do you think perhaps art
and marriage are incompatible?

16:59.017 --> 17:00.318
You could go in too.

17:00.350 --> 17:02.386
I prefer to wait.
Something might happen.

17:02.419 --> 17:04.855
I might run into someone
who likes art.

17:04.887 --> 17:06.656
That would take care
of the extra ticket.

17:06.691 --> 17:08.993
That would take care
of a lot of extras.

17:10.361 --> 17:12.364
I have to get this.

17:15.531 --> 17:19.538
Paintings. Look at her
paintings. Vaginas. All vaginas.

17:19.569 --> 17:23.339
Pretending to be flowers.
You've got to be kidding me.

17:23.374 --> 17:28.512
She became this wise old hermit
in the desert devoted to her art

17:28.546 --> 17:30.782
and her paintings are amazing.

17:30.815 --> 17:33.285
Ok? Awesome!

17:33.317 --> 17:34.853
Are you mad?

17:34.885 --> 17:37.388
Yes! I am mad.
You make me mad!

17:38.256 --> 17:39.691
Really, really mad?

17:39.723 --> 17:41.926
Very, very mad!

17:41.960 --> 17:45.896
Maybe you are mad enough
to kiss me?

17:45.930 --> 17:47.532
You are dreaming!

17:47.565 --> 17:52.203
Yes, and I find myself
a prisoner in this dream.

17:54.271 --> 17:57.141
And in my dream,
you are frowning.

17:57.174 --> 18:01.046
And all I wanted was to kiss the
frown from your beautiful face.

18:01.078 --> 18:06.617
To banish that sad, sad frown
with the magic of my kiss.

18:08.853 --> 18:11.423
Arduino! Arduino! Arduino!

18:11.455 --> 18:13.791
Vita! Vita! Vita!

20:28.259 --> 20:30.095
Hi! Come on in.

20:30.127 --> 20:31.962
Hello, I'm Frank.

20:31.996 --> 20:34.365
Frank, yes, please.

20:34.398 --> 20:36.033
Reyna, Reyna.

20:36.067 --> 20:37.635
Am I saying it right?

20:37.669 --> 20:39.437
Yes, Reyna.

20:39.470 --> 20:41.472
You found me.

20:41.506 --> 20:44.542
- Frank?
- Yes, Frank. Yes.

20:44.575 --> 20:46.378
May I take your coat?

20:46.411 --> 20:47.979
Sure, sure.

20:48.011 --> 20:50.648
Here, I brought you
this little brown bag.

20:50.682 --> 20:52.049
Oh, thank you.

20:52.083 --> 20:54.252
You didn't have
to bring me anything,

20:54.285 --> 20:57.489
but I do like gifts,
so I'm glad you did.

21:00.857 --> 21:02.126
This looks really nice.

21:02.160 --> 21:04.329
I wasn't sure
if you liked red or white,

21:04.362 --> 21:06.564
or even if you liked wine
at all.

21:06.596 --> 21:08.966
Oh, oh, also this.

21:09.000 --> 21:11.568
Would you like some champagne?

21:12.703 --> 21:15.406
- Is it open?
- Almost.

21:15.440 --> 21:17.409
Are you hungry?
Would you like some cheese?

21:17.442 --> 21:19.144
Oh, I didn't take your jacket.

21:19.176 --> 21:21.913
- I can just put it here.
- No, no, no.

21:21.945 --> 21:23.580
Let me...

21:23.614 --> 21:24.783
Can you do the cork?

21:24.816 --> 21:28.486
I'm so bad with those.
I don't want to break my nails.

21:37.028 --> 21:39.331
I also have strawberries.

21:39.364 --> 21:41.865
Whole Foods, three for a dollar.

21:45.869 --> 21:47.371
Here.

21:49.307 --> 21:51.942
And we can use these.

21:55.246 --> 21:56.881
They're clean.

21:58.482 --> 22:00.018
I always spill.

22:00.050 --> 22:01.385
You like champagne?

22:03.320 --> 22:06.124
I drink champagne by surprise.

22:06.156 --> 22:07.791
Would you like a glass of water?

22:07.825 --> 22:10.295
No, no, this will be...

22:12.262 --> 22:14.798
Hey, I didn't see you!

22:16.567 --> 22:17.902
Well, look at you!

22:19.237 --> 22:21.538
He's really cute.
Is it a he?

22:21.571 --> 22:23.974
- Yes, it's a he.
- What's your name?

22:24.008 --> 22:27.979
Mini-Me is his name,
but I call him Mr. Mini.

22:28.011 --> 22:29.646
Mr. Mini.

22:31.449 --> 22:35.053
I am so happy to meet you.

22:37.288 --> 22:39.824
Come, sit.
Don't let him bother you.

22:39.856 --> 22:42.226
- But he won't let me pass.
- Mini, sit!

22:42.259 --> 22:43.827
I can see I'm in big trouble.

22:43.861 --> 22:45.397
I'm gonna have to pay the toll,
aren't I?

22:45.430 --> 22:46.865
Oh, yes, I am.

22:46.897 --> 22:48.098
Please, have your champagne.

22:48.132 --> 22:52.237
You are quite an amazing rascal.
Yes, you are.

22:52.269 --> 22:54.838
Is it all right?

22:54.872 --> 22:58.109
Mr. Mini,
you are a character, sir,

22:58.142 --> 23:01.379
and a very handsome one, too,
if I might add.

23:01.412 --> 23:02.846
He's pretty good.

23:02.880 --> 23:05.016
He doesn't bark,
he doesn't growl.

23:05.048 --> 23:06.917
He's been a bad boy today.

23:06.951 --> 23:08.185
I'm very annoyed at him.

23:08.219 --> 23:09.354
What did he do?

23:09.386 --> 23:11.623
He bit me,
right here on my finger.

23:11.655 --> 23:12.757
Where? Let me see.

23:12.789 --> 23:18.462
What a bad boy!
What am I going to do with you?

23:18.496 --> 23:23.268
I am going to eat you for supper
and teach you a lesson.

23:23.300 --> 23:25.803
You must not bite.

23:25.836 --> 23:29.706
No, you're such a bad boy today.

23:29.740 --> 23:31.942
I'm sorry.

23:31.976 --> 23:35.213
Have your champagne
and some strawberries.

23:35.246 --> 23:37.715
Don't pay attention
to this monster.

23:39.317 --> 23:41.653
Do you like the music?

23:41.685 --> 23:43.288
Do you want to hear
something else?

23:43.320 --> 23:45.222
I have other things.

23:45.256 --> 23:47.492
Do you want to look?

23:47.525 --> 23:49.461
What did I say? No!

23:49.493 --> 23:53.831
What are you doing to me?
You are so cruel!

23:53.865 --> 23:58.068
Okay, now I'm gonna have to bite
off all four of your feet.

23:58.102 --> 24:02.574
One, two, three, four.

24:04.608 --> 24:06.009
I'm sorry,

24:06.042 --> 24:08.145
'cause he really drives me
so crazy.

24:08.179 --> 24:09.480
He's so spoiled.

24:09.513 --> 24:10.747
How old is he?

24:10.780 --> 24:12.750
I got him three years ago.

24:12.782 --> 24:14.918
He was just a few weeks.

24:14.951 --> 24:17.154
Hey, what did I say?

24:17.188 --> 24:19.757
Repeat after me:

24:19.789 --> 24:22.426
You are a bad boy!

24:22.460 --> 24:24.596
Does he speak
more than one language too?

24:24.628 --> 24:26.697
He doesn't listen
in any language.

24:26.730 --> 24:28.298
How many do you speak?

24:28.332 --> 24:29.601
Just two.

24:29.634 --> 24:31.102
Spanish?

24:31.134 --> 24:32.769
Spanish Mexican.

24:32.803 --> 24:34.005
You're Mexican?

24:34.038 --> 24:36.941
Mexican American.

24:36.973 --> 24:38.675
I should have a Chihuahua.

24:38.709 --> 24:40.010
That's what I'm going to do.

24:40.044 --> 24:42.380
I am going to make you
into a Chihuahua

24:42.413 --> 24:45.383
and call you Taco, yes.

24:45.415 --> 24:49.253
I'm taking you into the lab
like Dr. Frankenstein.

25:08.372 --> 25:10.708
Your hair is so golden.

25:12.609 --> 25:14.311
But it's not.

25:14.345 --> 25:15.980
It's red.

25:17.114 --> 25:19.884
I've always wanted my hair
to be gold.

25:19.916 --> 25:21.653
Real gold.

25:28.025 --> 25:29.227
Reyna?

25:29.259 --> 25:30.761
Yes?

25:31.962 --> 25:36.200
That's a really pretty name,
Reyna.

25:39.869 --> 25:41.572
I like it.

25:41.605 --> 25:43.106
Reyna.

25:44.808 --> 25:47.278
- Do you like it?
- I like it.

25:50.780 --> 25:52.250
Oops.

26:19.477 --> 26:22.046
Would you like to take a shower?

26:22.078 --> 26:23.815
Here, come.

27:21.005 --> 27:24.042
You can leave your things here
if you like.

27:24.075 --> 27:25.777
There's a hook,

27:25.809 --> 27:28.211
and when you're ready,

27:28.244 --> 27:30.447
come and find me.

28:03.047 --> 28:07.585
Are you cold?

28:20.297 --> 28:22.733
Take some water with you.

28:33.309 --> 28:35.212
Do you have everything?

28:36.713 --> 28:42.452
I am leaving with so much more
than I came here with.

28:42.486 --> 28:45.022
You gave me so much.

28:45.055 --> 28:47.491
You gave me a lot too.

28:49.058 --> 28:51.663
I didn't think
I would be so open.

28:54.731 --> 28:56.701
You opened me.

28:56.733 --> 28:57.868
I know.

28:59.569 --> 29:02.105
For me as well.

29:02.138 --> 29:03.907
No, really.

29:03.941 --> 29:06.744
Well, I... I'm sure you've had...

29:06.777 --> 29:09.080
Not the first time.

29:09.113 --> 29:10.981
No.

29:11.015 --> 29:13.685
Never on the first time, no.

29:20.590 --> 29:23.059
Do you have your water?

29:23.093 --> 29:24.429
Yes.

29:25.930 --> 29:27.632
The water of life.

29:27.664 --> 29:29.099
You give me life.

29:33.470 --> 29:35.105
Where do I go?

29:35.138 --> 29:36.875
Make a right to the elevator.

29:43.948 --> 29:45.617
Be safe.

30:08.638 --> 30:10.073
Going down?

30:59.256 --> 31:01.659
I need to see you again, Reyna.

31:03.192 --> 31:05.096
Do you have an hour
this Tuesday?

31:06.763 --> 31:08.231
At two?

31:12.903 --> 31:15.940
Do you know what
a rare woman you are?

31:17.207 --> 31:20.611
I have just achieved
the age of 60.

31:20.644 --> 31:22.380
What am I saying? I'm 66.

31:22.413 --> 31:24.714
I'm lying about my age.

31:24.748 --> 31:28.052
Would you like me better
if you thought I was only 60?

31:32.088 --> 31:34.024
I want to go further with you.

31:34.057 --> 31:36.693
I want nothing to be forbidden.

31:36.727 --> 31:40.598
I want to learn what you love
and how to give it to you.

31:46.670 --> 31:48.873
You astonish me.

31:50.473 --> 31:54.211
I don't have the words
to say what I'm going through.

31:54.243 --> 31:57.380
I don't know if I can harness
the language I need

31:57.413 --> 32:00.584
to make you understand
what I mean.

32:00.616 --> 32:03.053
Harness, like what you put
on a horse?

32:03.086 --> 32:04.989
Yes.

32:05.021 --> 32:07.557
What you release in me

32:07.590 --> 32:10.794
is as powerful as a horse,

32:10.827 --> 32:13.163
and to express it,

32:13.196 --> 32:18.401
to contain this horse of desire,

32:18.434 --> 32:20.971
I need to harness it with words.

32:23.973 --> 32:26.777
I feel like I've been sent
an angel.

32:31.448 --> 32:34.151
You have a touch that I trust,

32:34.183 --> 32:37.922
that takes me beyond
where I've ever been.

32:40.289 --> 32:42.692
I love being naked with you.

32:44.028 --> 32:46.096
I love our talking.

32:47.730 --> 32:50.667
I love how
you never stop playing.

32:54.003 --> 32:56.339
I love your harness.

33:10.988 --> 33:12.655
I don't know.

33:14.557 --> 33:16.626
I didn't expect this to happen.

33:19.997 --> 33:21.966
I don't know.

33:25.402 --> 33:28.072
Tomorrow is October 1st.

33:28.105 --> 33:31.342
I'm so happy to begin
this month with you.

33:35.112 --> 33:37.480
Are you available
this coming Thursday,

33:37.513 --> 33:39.716
11 a.m., for two hours?

33:39.750 --> 33:44.755
I can see you this Thursday
from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m.

33:44.788 --> 33:46.222
Can't wait.

33:46.256 --> 33:49.393
- Smile!
- I am smiling!

33:49.425 --> 33:53.196
Kisses!

34:57.927 --> 34:59.929
Yeah, 'cause there's
nothing there.

34:59.963 --> 35:02.066
It's, you know...

35:02.099 --> 35:03.634
Are you all right?

35:03.666 --> 35:05.603
Yes, I'm fine.

35:22.452 --> 35:24.255
That was new.

35:27.291 --> 35:29.426
You helped me.

35:35.666 --> 35:39.603
I feel like you're
the blood in my veins.

35:39.635 --> 35:42.605
Right now I'd fight
a war for you.

35:42.639 --> 35:46.043
You'd better wait
until the morning.

35:46.076 --> 35:48.211
I can barely stand.

35:48.244 --> 35:50.047
You kill me.

36:26.349 --> 36:30.188
I don't like my life
in this marriage.

36:32.789 --> 36:36.460
So then don't live it.

36:43.733 --> 36:48.172
I am out of love!

36:48.204 --> 36:52.442
And I want to be in love!

36:59.782 --> 37:03.052
I am in here.

37:03.085 --> 37:07.757
Somewhere,
my meaning is in here!

37:09.559 --> 37:13.864
You are responsible to me!

37:13.896 --> 37:16.099
Deprivation.

37:16.132 --> 37:21.804
You are responsible to me!

37:21.838 --> 37:24.108
Deprivation!

37:37.420 --> 37:41.224
What's the word
for "constellation"?

37:41.257 --> 37:43.660
Constelación.

37:51.534 --> 37:55.672
A new constelación
has been discovered.

37:55.706 --> 37:57.608
Shall I show it to you?

37:57.641 --> 37:59.242
Don't we have to look
at the stars?

37:59.275 --> 38:02.445
No, this is a constelación
of the body.

38:02.478 --> 38:05.949
- But that's on Earth.
- Yes, but it's a heavenly body.

38:07.784 --> 38:09.987
There are four points

38:10.019 --> 38:13.757
which I'll need to map out.

38:17.159 --> 38:20.431
Map me.

38:20.463 --> 38:24.735
The first point of this
heavenly, earthly constelación

38:28.739 --> 38:33.311
begins right beneath your arm.

38:38.014 --> 38:43.019
And then from there,
swoops slowly down

38:43.052 --> 38:46.989
to the outer circle
of your left breast,

38:47.023 --> 38:49.126
which is point two.

38:51.661 --> 38:55.566
Then up between both breasts

38:55.599 --> 38:57.801
to the neck

38:57.833 --> 39:02.138
under the arch of your chin,

39:02.172 --> 39:06.009
for point number three.

39:06.041 --> 39:08.244
Then finally,

39:08.277 --> 39:12.382
the lips for point number four.

39:13.682 --> 39:20.757
And the constelación, Reyna,
is complete.

39:23.927 --> 39:26.063
- Frank.
- Yes?

39:30.634 --> 39:32.702
My name is Emilia.

39:42.378 --> 39:44.248
Emilia.

39:56.393 --> 39:57.628
Bless you!

39:57.661 --> 39:59.195
Bless you.

40:32.094 --> 40:34.096
Not everybody can hold him.

40:35.599 --> 40:37.734
I bring him treats.

40:37.766 --> 40:39.802
He thinks you're his father.

40:39.835 --> 40:41.571
I've given you a son.

40:41.605 --> 40:43.307
Who do you think
he resembles most?

40:43.340 --> 40:45.776
- You.
- You're my boy.

41:06.963 --> 41:09.333
May I ask you a question?

41:13.570 --> 41:15.539
Are you married?

41:18.007 --> 41:20.143
At the moment, yes.

41:22.978 --> 41:26.315
But probably not
for much longer.

41:26.349 --> 41:28.184
No way. Why?

41:30.320 --> 41:31.722
Well...

41:32.822 --> 41:34.557
I'm here with you.

41:35.925 --> 41:37.561
No way.

41:39.528 --> 41:41.398
No way.

42:17.199 --> 42:19.335
I have a child.

42:21.204 --> 42:22.539
Boy or girl?

42:22.572 --> 42:25.108
A boy, Emilio.

42:25.141 --> 42:26.276
How old?

42:26.309 --> 42:28.045
He's 6.

42:29.579 --> 42:31.248
Picture?

42:31.280 --> 42:32.882
Here.

42:35.751 --> 42:37.621
Your eyes.

42:43.726 --> 42:45.562
Did you divorce?

42:46.262 --> 42:48.632
He's, uh, a doctor.

42:48.664 --> 42:50.634
He does operations.

42:50.666 --> 42:53.069
- Surgeon?
- Yes.

42:57.673 --> 43:00.643
He could never make love to me.

43:03.179 --> 43:04.481
I don't know.

43:04.514 --> 43:10.487
We did at first, but then he...
he couldn't, at all.

43:15.858 --> 43:18.061
I don't know
if he stopped loving me,

43:18.094 --> 43:20.831
if I wasn't beautiful
to him anymore.

43:22.599 --> 43:24.768
I couldn't take it.

43:27.137 --> 43:30.307
He really hurt me,

43:30.340 --> 43:32.610
that I wasn't desired.

43:40.684 --> 43:42.419
Do you have any children?

43:42.452 --> 43:43.787
No.

43:45.855 --> 43:49.291
I have no one, Emilia.

43:49.324 --> 43:50.960
No one.

43:50.994 --> 43:52.461
Just you.

43:52.494 --> 43:54.197
You are everyone.

43:55.699 --> 43:57.300
You are all I have!

43:59.802 --> 44:02.105
Do you want to take a shower?

44:06.876 --> 44:09.146
A few days ago,
me and my cousin

44:09.179 --> 44:11.947
went to the park
and rented bicycles.

44:11.981 --> 44:14.851
You will laugh at me,
but I had to rent a tricycle

44:14.884 --> 44:17.887
because I am so bad
with two wheels,

44:17.920 --> 44:20.222
but I have to say,
it was fun.

44:20.255 --> 44:24.126
Mini says hi,
and don't forget the treats!

44:28.264 --> 44:31.568
I can meet you this Wednesday
at 12:30.

44:33.168 --> 44:34.904
- I can meet you...
- What's this?

44:34.938 --> 44:35.905
...at 12:30.

44:35.938 --> 44:37.673
What have you done?

44:37.706 --> 44:40.309
I can meet you this Wednesday
at 12:30.

44:42.679 --> 44:45.148
Here, I got this for you.

44:45.181 --> 44:46.817
What have you got?

44:49.885 --> 44:52.521
I didn't know about the size.

44:52.554 --> 44:54.356
It's your birthday.

44:57.393 --> 44:59.329
This is really beautiful.

44:59.362 --> 45:00.764
You think it is?

45:00.797 --> 45:02.499
I didn't know what to get.

45:02.532 --> 45:03.834
I don't know.

45:03.867 --> 45:05.368
Do you smoke?

45:05.400 --> 45:07.203
Once in a while, a cigar.

45:07.237 --> 45:09.505
My husband smokes cigars.

45:14.476 --> 45:16.679
And now, for you.

45:21.483 --> 45:23.519
This.

45:23.552 --> 45:24.621
No way.

45:24.653 --> 45:28.057
I'm not the one getting older,
you are!

45:28.090 --> 45:30.559
Actually, I'm getting younger.

45:37.000 --> 45:40.936
I wanted to see what it looked
like against your skin.

45:53.182 --> 46:00.222
Will you wear it?

46:03.592 --> 46:07.630
I wish we could go out
to a museum or a movie.

46:26.449 --> 46:28.918
Would you like to take a shower?

46:28.952 --> 46:32.255
If you don't like the shirt,
I can take it back.

46:32.288 --> 46:34.757
I've got another surprise
for you when you get out.

46:34.791 --> 46:36.359
I'll meet you.

47:35.050 --> 47:37.019
Frank!

47:38.621 --> 47:40.557
I asked you
to please wash your hands

47:40.590 --> 47:42.158
before you pick up Mr. Mini.

47:42.190 --> 47:43.425
I don't want him to get sick,

47:43.458 --> 47:45.995
and there's so many infections
all around.

47:46.028 --> 47:49.331
Why do you look so red?

47:53.302 --> 47:57.373
Would you like
to take a shower?

48:06.215 --> 48:09.052
Would you like
some champagne?

48:12.155 --> 48:13.857
Do you have your water?

48:13.889 --> 48:15.357
Hey, come on in.

48:15.391 --> 48:17.260
Hello, I'm Frank.

48:17.293 --> 48:20.063
Frank, yes, please.

48:23.432 --> 48:26.369
I'm sorry.

48:26.402 --> 48:28.371
Make a right to the elevator.

48:28.403 --> 48:30.407
Be safe.

48:39.014 --> 48:40.951
I'm sorry.

48:48.090 --> 48:50.259
Face it.

48:53.929 --> 48:57.433
I know. Face it.

49:00.936 --> 49:02.838
What are you doing?

49:05.507 --> 49:07.176
I know. What am I doing?

49:09.679 --> 49:11.981
Face it.

49:12.981 --> 49:15.418
Yah, yah, yah.

49:15.451 --> 49:18.088
And that's just what I'll do.

49:18.121 --> 49:21.423
Going to get freeni...

49:21.456 --> 49:23.926
...like Houdini.

49:53.422 --> 49:54.723
Frank!

49:57.193 --> 50:01.297
I would like to ask you a favor
because I truly need it,

50:01.329 --> 50:03.632
if it's not too complicated,
impossible

50:03.666 --> 50:05.802
to write a review for me.

50:05.835 --> 50:08.804
Will you do this?

50:08.838 --> 50:12.809
One of the guys I saw wrote
a not-very-nice review of me,

50:12.842 --> 50:15.311
and I'm unhappy about it.

50:15.344 --> 50:18.748
Usually, I get nines,
and this was a six,

50:18.780 --> 50:21.250
and that makes me so mad.

50:21.284 --> 50:24.253
And it's the most recent one.

50:26.389 --> 50:30.994
I need another nine,
and I want you to write it.

50:31.027 --> 50:34.030
And put down
everything we did.

50:55.918 --> 50:59.756
I just finished
writing you a review.

51:02.458 --> 51:05.695
I don't know when
they'll put it up on their site.

51:09.565 --> 51:14.471
Usually, it takes, at most,
48 hours to get posted.

51:17.239 --> 51:19.475
I hope it will help.

51:33.155 --> 51:36.726
You make me feel
like a special woman.

51:36.759 --> 51:41.498
I truly appreciate your time
and help with the review.

51:41.530 --> 51:45.501
Cannot wait until
my next chance to see you.

51:45.534 --> 51:48.237
Sweet sleep.

51:52.675 --> 51:55.311
I'll be calling soon.

51:59.282 --> 52:01.184
Sorry to bother you.

52:01.217 --> 52:03.519
I know you wrote
a review for me,

52:03.552 --> 52:06.588
but it has been
almost a week,

52:06.621 --> 52:09.791
and I truly need your review
at this moment.

52:09.824 --> 52:11.326
I've sent them another email

52:11.360 --> 52:15.465
asking why my review
was not posted

52:15.498 --> 52:17.766
and I'm waiting to hear back.

52:19.802 --> 52:23.106
I know, it's very frustrating.

52:23.139 --> 52:27.277
Can you please find out
why this review is not posted?

52:27.309 --> 52:31.581
I will keep pursuing
and see what I can do.

52:43.059 --> 52:46.496
I hope that your review will
change my situation for good.

52:49.498 --> 52:52.367
There is no one like you.

52:54.202 --> 52:56.639
There is no one like you.

52:58.206 --> 53:01.143
I really count on it.

53:03.278 --> 53:05.315
I'm shedding.

53:05.347 --> 53:08.150
I'm worse than Mr. Mini.

53:17.025 --> 53:18.527
What wine is this?

53:22.197 --> 53:24.533
Red.

53:27.103 --> 53:30.072
At some point,
you have to ask yourself,

53:30.106 --> 53:34.110
how many lives
do you think you get to live?

53:39.581 --> 53:41.284
What are you going to do?

53:41.317 --> 53:44.786
Keep starting over
and hoping that this time,

53:44.820 --> 53:48.091
what, you'll be different?

53:48.123 --> 53:51.426
The other person
will be different.

53:51.460 --> 53:53.195
The world will magically change

53:53.228 --> 53:56.698
in a way that will make things
better for you.

53:56.731 --> 54:01.036
Whatever list you're keeping,
you better throw it out.

54:01.070 --> 54:03.972
It's not about
finding something new.

54:04.005 --> 54:08.277
It's about restoring something
that has been broken.

54:09.811 --> 54:12.447
It's about repair.

55:14.976 --> 55:16.778
When he comes home
the next time,

55:16.811 --> 55:19.449
you'll have to surprise him.

55:19.481 --> 55:22.784
I'm sure he'd like that.

55:22.818 --> 55:25.788
No, you don't have
to tell me everything.

55:25.820 --> 55:27.789
TMI.

55:27.822 --> 55:29.858
When does he get back?

55:29.891 --> 55:33.395
So, see, you have
plenty of time to prepare.

55:33.429 --> 55:36.965
Do you have one of those things
you could practice on?

55:38.501 --> 55:41.137
I'll send you a link.

55:41.170 --> 55:43.639
They're very authentic!

55:43.672 --> 55:47.143
That's up to you,
there's many variations.

55:49.545 --> 55:52.981
Who's going to save you
from your fantasies?

55:53.014 --> 55:54.717
Who's going to be your guardian?

55:54.750 --> 55:56.686
I love Manhattan.

55:56.719 --> 55:59.922
I couldn't do winter,
but at least we could leave.

55:59.954 --> 56:02.557
South Beach,
give me Miami.

56:02.590 --> 56:06.328
Give me sand,
lots of sand.

56:13.369 --> 56:16.838
"To be or not to be.

56:16.871 --> 56:20.175
That is the question.

56:20.208 --> 56:22.010
Whether 'tis nobler
in the mind..."

56:22.043 --> 56:23.246
All right, all right.

56:23.278 --> 56:25.447
That's it! That is it!

56:25.481 --> 56:28.017
I mean,
if you don't know by now.

56:28.050 --> 56:32.522
Look where she reads.

56:41.563 --> 56:43.865
Pau...

56:43.898 --> 56:46.469
Paula, look...

56:49.070 --> 56:52.541
We each have about
ten good years left

56:52.574 --> 56:56.812
before our lives become
predominantly medical.

56:56.846 --> 57:00.882
I think we should live them
to the fullest.

57:00.916 --> 57:02.718
I don't want either of us

57:02.751 --> 57:05.588
to have to compromise
or not do something

57:05.621 --> 57:09.625
we really want to just because
the other one doesn't approve.

57:09.657 --> 57:11.726
I want to have
a fuller life, Paula.

57:11.760 --> 57:14.430
I want you to have
a fuller life.

57:16.264 --> 57:20.769
We're just draining
each other, Paula.

57:20.802 --> 57:23.739
We're running out of sand.

57:27.376 --> 57:30.079
We have to stop this.

57:30.112 --> 57:32.148
We have to stop!

57:32.181 --> 57:34.750
But how do you stop it?

57:34.782 --> 57:37.619
What's the resolution?

57:37.652 --> 57:40.255
Where can one go from here?

57:40.289 --> 57:44.627
"Who would fardels bear,
to grunt and sweat

57:44.659 --> 57:48.364
under a weary life?"

57:48.396 --> 57:52.668
Honestly, I can't foresee.

57:52.701 --> 57:58.007
There is no next step,
or one after, or one after that.

58:00.476 --> 58:04.180
This puzzles the will

58:04.213 --> 58:10.019
and, thus, conscience
does make cowards of us all.

58:10.052 --> 58:14.023
- Divorce.
- Decisive.

58:14.056 --> 58:16.458
Paula!

58:20.695 --> 58:23.164
I...

58:23.197 --> 58:25.634
...want...

58:28.170 --> 58:30.806
...to leave.

58:34.208 --> 58:35.544
Goodnight, baby.

58:43.518 --> 58:46.321
How was your trip?
Did you get to the exhibit?

58:46.355 --> 58:48.157
It was all right.
Yes, I did.

58:48.190 --> 58:50.659
I don't think the sprinklers
are working again.

58:50.693 --> 58:52.995
That's because
I turned them off.

58:53.027 --> 58:54.396
Why did you do that?

58:54.429 --> 58:56.331
Right before I left,
I turned them off.

58:56.364 --> 58:58.567
- It's so dry.
- It was raining.

58:58.601 --> 59:00.436
- It doesn't matter.
- Everything got soaked.

59:00.469 --> 59:03.005
- It dries up really fast.
- Four days.

59:03.038 --> 59:06.074
- I don't want brown grass.
- I think it's okay.

59:06.108 --> 59:09.345
- It still gets dry.
- I will turn them on.

59:09.378 --> 59:12.282
I will turn them on.

01:01:05.893 --> 01:01:08.463
He couldn't sleep yet.

01:01:08.496 --> 01:01:10.799
He hadn't finished the day.

01:01:10.833 --> 01:01:14.503
He hadn't accomplished
what he could have.

01:01:16.003 --> 01:01:19.974
He hadn't completed himself,

01:01:20.007 --> 01:01:22.778
and he couldn't go to bed...

01:01:24.847 --> 01:01:27.016
...incomplete.

01:01:29.184 --> 01:01:31.153
Sex would have done it.

01:01:31.186 --> 01:01:34.323
Sex would have
completed him.

01:01:34.356 --> 01:01:38.494
He hadn't gotten
a new life, a new work,

01:01:38.527 --> 01:01:40.929
a new woman.

01:01:40.963 --> 01:01:45.768
He was still stuck with the old,
and the new was all around him.

01:01:45.800 --> 01:01:48.770
And he hadn't made it happen.

01:01:48.804 --> 01:01:50.338
He had failed.

01:01:50.371 --> 01:01:53.274
How could he sleep?

01:01:53.307 --> 01:01:57.380
If you have sex,
you have hope.

01:01:59.547 --> 01:02:02.217
If there's no sex...

01:02:03.751 --> 01:02:06.255
...there's no hope.

01:02:16.231 --> 01:02:18.434
No sleep.

01:02:42.190 --> 01:02:44.893
Shall I turn on your coffee?

01:02:46.594 --> 01:02:49.330
Thank you.

01:02:49.364 --> 01:02:51.733
Thank you.

01:02:54.869 --> 01:02:57.405
- No talk!
- Shh!

01:02:57.438 --> 01:03:00.643
There is nothing
about you that I admire

01:03:00.675 --> 01:03:03.679
and, also, there is nothing
about you that I desire.

01:03:03.711 --> 01:03:05.780
I do not look at you and think,

01:03:05.813 --> 01:03:09.317
"I really want that guy
to get me naked."

01:03:09.351 --> 01:03:10.586
I mean, I can think

01:03:10.619 --> 01:03:12.421
of about a thousand other things
I'd rather do

01:03:12.454 --> 01:03:14.590
than have to make love to you.

01:03:14.623 --> 01:03:16.826
Just the number
of bestsellers alone.

01:03:16.858 --> 01:03:18.927
- Paula!
- No talk!

01:03:18.960 --> 01:03:20.962
- Shh!
- And there's nothing

01:03:20.996 --> 01:03:22.698
you can do to change it.

01:03:22.731 --> 01:03:24.466
You can shower,
brush your teeth,

01:03:24.498 --> 01:03:26.868
light the candles,
put on some music,

01:03:26.902 --> 01:03:28.137
and spritz on cologne,

01:03:28.170 --> 01:03:31.606
but it's still going to be you,
isn't it?

01:03:31.639 --> 01:03:34.609
What it all comes down to:

01:03:34.643 --> 01:03:36.478
You.

01:03:38.213 --> 01:03:40.516
Here.

01:03:40.548 --> 01:03:43.485
- I'm thinking of a word.
- Paula...

01:03:43.518 --> 01:03:45.119
- No talk!
- Shh!

01:03:45.152 --> 01:03:47.455
You know, usually, when one
loses, one leaves the field,

01:03:47.489 --> 01:03:50.726
but you continue to stand on
the ground of your own defeat.

01:03:50.759 --> 01:03:52.695
You think that
if you don't admit it

01:03:52.728 --> 01:03:55.496
that you can still stay
in the game.

01:03:55.530 --> 01:03:58.634
You can't keep losing
and fool yourself into thinking

01:03:58.666 --> 01:04:00.369
that you are still playing.

01:04:00.402 --> 01:04:04.173
The children feel the same way.

01:04:04.206 --> 01:04:07.509
Do you know what word
I'm thinking of?

01:04:07.541 --> 01:04:08.810
- Here.
- Paula...

01:04:08.844 --> 01:04:11.313
- No talk!
- Both of them.

01:04:11.346 --> 01:04:13.983
In fact, they can't even stand
it if you are in the house

01:04:14.016 --> 01:04:15.550
at the same time
when they are.

01:04:15.583 --> 01:04:17.685
Now what does that say
about the fathering, huh?

01:04:17.719 --> 01:04:20.755
Is that the type of father
you'd imagined yourself to be,

01:04:20.789 --> 01:04:26.695
or can we just add that
on to the list of failures?

01:04:26.728 --> 01:04:29.331
No respect, no desire,

01:04:29.364 --> 01:04:33.836
and no love from your spawn.

01:04:33.869 --> 01:04:36.838
Do you know what
we don't call this?

01:04:36.871 --> 01:04:41.542
We don't call this "success,"
that's what we don't call this.

01:04:41.576 --> 01:04:44.713
The word, the word is...

01:04:45.880 --> 01:04:48.717
The word is...

01:05:01.963 --> 01:05:03.798
- Contempt.
- I put in time.

01:05:03.831 --> 01:05:07.536
- Don't say that I didn't.
- You want to talk about time?

01:05:07.568 --> 01:05:11.572
Time is sand and it is
falling through the glass.

01:05:11.606 --> 01:05:13.642
You think this is all a prelude,

01:05:13.675 --> 01:05:15.044
that the curtain isn't up yet

01:05:15.077 --> 01:05:18.547
and you're waiting
for the show to start?

01:05:18.579 --> 01:05:21.549
Well, it's up. You're on.

01:05:21.583 --> 01:05:23.552
And it's not all that long
before the curtain

01:05:23.585 --> 01:05:26.822
comes back down
and the show is over.

01:05:26.855 --> 01:05:30.059
Did you like your part?

01:05:30.092 --> 01:05:33.095
Did you play it well?

01:05:35.429 --> 01:05:38.266
Paula needs a necky.

01:05:46.108 --> 01:05:49.778
- Paula...
- Shh, no talk. Necky.

01:06:46.201 --> 01:06:47.969
I am not your enemy.

01:06:55.844 --> 01:06:58.914
Our mail has arrived.

01:07:02.349 --> 01:07:04.719
- What are you doing?
- Just some errands.

01:07:04.753 --> 01:07:06.822
- Are we having lunch?
- I don't think so.

01:07:06.855 --> 01:07:09.057
- Do you need to get gas?
- No, I'm fine.

01:07:09.090 --> 01:07:10.558
- Are you below half?
- Maybe.

01:07:10.592 --> 01:07:12.027
What if there's
an earthquake?

01:07:12.059 --> 01:07:13.996
Here, hold this for a second.

01:07:14.028 --> 01:07:16.331
Do you know how much this was
at Ralph's? Four dollars.

01:07:16.364 --> 01:07:17.932
Do you know how much
at Gelson's?

01:07:17.965 --> 01:07:19.902
- Seven.
- Huh.

01:07:19.934 --> 01:07:21.869
If you're going to
the post office, take these,

01:07:21.902 --> 01:07:23.171
I'm sending them to my mother.

01:07:23.204 --> 01:07:24.706
I tried for about a year
to get her to wear them

01:07:24.739 --> 01:07:26.507
and now she won't
take them off.

01:07:26.541 --> 01:07:28.677
- You want delivery confirmation?
- I don't need it.

01:07:28.710 --> 01:07:31.246
I may get a massage later,
one of those salt scrubs

01:07:31.278 --> 01:07:34.949
that leaves my skin feeling like
that of a much younger woman.

01:07:34.983 --> 01:07:37.186
A much younger woman.

01:07:37.219 --> 01:07:39.288
- Okay.
- What time is the game?

01:07:39.320 --> 01:07:41.355
7:30.

01:07:41.389 --> 01:07:44.126
- Who are they playing?
- Sharks.

01:07:44.159 --> 01:07:47.195
They'll do it, they're going to
make the playoffs, don't worry.

01:07:47.228 --> 01:07:48.696
- That's it?
- That's it.

01:07:48.730 --> 01:07:50.199
- All fixed?
- That's what you do.

01:07:50.231 --> 01:07:51.467
They're four points
out of eighth.

01:07:51.500 --> 01:07:54.036
They are going to win the Cup.

01:07:54.068 --> 01:07:57.239
- With six games left.
- Seven games to play.

01:07:57.271 --> 01:07:58.873
They get four of them
and they're in.

01:07:58.907 --> 01:08:03.045
- Running out of time.
- There's still plenty of ice.

01:08:03.077 --> 01:08:05.746
- You seem so sure.
- The Sharks are shit.

01:08:05.780 --> 01:08:08.550
Even if they win,
they're losers.

01:08:08.583 --> 01:08:11.052
They always get to the finals,
win the division,

01:08:11.085 --> 01:08:13.054
and then choke for the Cup.

01:08:13.088 --> 01:08:14.923
They're over.

01:08:14.956 --> 01:08:16.591
When are you going
to change the filters?

01:08:16.625 --> 01:08:17.725
When you least expect it.

01:08:17.759 --> 01:08:19.560
How about when I most expect it?

01:08:19.594 --> 01:08:21.828
Smoke alarms, too,
every six months.

01:08:21.863 --> 01:08:24.298
Where does the time go?

01:08:24.332 --> 01:08:25.934
Where do the batteries go?

01:08:25.966 --> 01:08:31.072
So, if the Sharks
end up in first...

01:08:31.104 --> 01:08:33.509
This phone work.
Look at it, it's dead.

01:08:33.542 --> 01:08:36.345
- Where are they now?
- Probably the battery.

01:08:36.377 --> 01:08:39.148
First, and we barely make it in,

01:08:39.180 --> 01:08:41.082
guess who we play
in the first round?

01:08:41.115 --> 01:08:42.117
Dead.

01:08:42.149 --> 01:08:43.451
I'll switch it out
with another phone,

01:08:43.484 --> 01:08:45.920
see if that helps.

01:08:45.953 --> 01:08:49.457
So just think of tonight
as practice then.

01:08:49.490 --> 01:08:52.694
Nope. How do you
open this thing?

01:09:18.220 --> 01:09:21.890
- This is fun.
- You got to do it.

01:09:28.863 --> 01:09:30.865
It works.

01:09:32.265 --> 01:09:34.635
So, who is going to do it?

01:09:34.667 --> 01:09:36.470
I'll get another one of these.

01:09:36.502 --> 01:09:38.471
There's one near Whole Foods.

01:09:38.506 --> 01:09:41.975
All of them, Carts, Kopi, Toffi,

01:09:42.010 --> 01:09:44.313
all of them are going to score.

01:09:44.345 --> 01:09:45.979
- You seem so sure.
- You want to bet?

01:09:46.014 --> 01:09:46.981
A million, two.

01:09:47.015 --> 01:09:48.984
- No, I'm with you.
- He scores!

01:09:49.015 --> 01:09:50.318
How many times
are we going to hear that?

01:09:50.350 --> 01:09:52.487
- He scores!
- I say four.

01:09:52.520 --> 01:09:54.389
That works unless
the Sharks get five.

01:09:54.421 --> 01:09:57.259
Not tonight.
Tonight belongs to the Kings,

01:09:57.292 --> 01:09:59.228
and what other team
has Quick in the goal?

01:09:59.261 --> 01:10:02.598
Nobody, and nobody
gets past Quick.

01:10:02.631 --> 01:10:04.199
You want soup?

01:10:04.231 --> 01:10:06.001
It's fantastic.
Do you want me to?

01:10:06.033 --> 01:10:07.668
Soup, sure, sure.
Soup is fine.

01:10:07.702 --> 01:10:09.037
I said "suit."

01:10:09.069 --> 01:10:10.938
Do you want me
to pick up your suit?

01:10:10.971 --> 01:10:14.108
I thought you said
do I want soup?

01:10:14.141 --> 01:10:16.444
Hearing, honey,
you've got to get it checked.

01:10:16.478 --> 01:10:18.012
It's getting worse.

01:10:18.046 --> 01:10:20.015
I left you something
in the fridge.

01:10:20.047 --> 01:10:23.551
I'll pick something up.
We're all Kings.

01:11:09.130 --> 01:11:11.800
What wine is this?

01:11:16.438 --> 01:11:19.408
Why I Love Paula.

01:11:19.440 --> 01:11:24.412
Starring Paula as herself,
with Frank as the husband,

01:11:24.445 --> 01:11:26.515
a recurring role.

01:11:26.547 --> 01:11:29.350
She's a force.

01:11:29.384 --> 01:11:32.354
She's unpredictable.

01:11:36.890 --> 01:11:40.094
And she is always on guard.

01:11:40.127 --> 01:11:41.262
Crumb.

01:11:43.398 --> 01:11:48.502
And in tonight's episode,
she... well, see for yourself.

01:11:48.536 --> 01:11:52.841
- Try these on.
- Why I Love Paula.

01:11:54.708 --> 01:11:58.012
- What are they?
- Lingerie.

01:11:58.046 --> 01:12:00.615
- Where'd you get these?
- At Victoria's Secret.

01:12:00.648 --> 01:12:02.117
- On sale?
- No.

01:12:02.149 --> 01:12:03.719
- What did you pay?
- I'm not telling.

01:12:03.752 --> 01:12:05.954
I bet you paid too much. I know
where to get these for nothing.

01:12:05.987 --> 01:12:08.657
Well, they're pretty much
nothing as it is.

01:12:08.689 --> 01:12:10.157
Where's the receipt?
Did you keep it?

01:12:10.190 --> 01:12:12.493
- Will you try these on?
- No.

01:12:12.527 --> 01:12:14.061
Red.

01:12:14.095 --> 01:12:16.832
Where'd you get it?

01:12:16.864 --> 01:12:18.899
My usual place.

01:12:18.932 --> 01:12:21.302
Usually, their wine is good.

01:12:21.336 --> 01:12:23.572
I gave it to you last week,
you loved it.

01:12:23.604 --> 01:12:25.139
I'll give it to you again
on Thursday.

01:12:25.172 --> 01:12:27.141
- You'll love it again.
- I don't think so.

01:12:27.175 --> 01:12:29.144
Don't drink it, then.
Give it to me.

01:12:29.176 --> 01:12:30.978
I'm not opening another bottle.

01:12:31.011 --> 01:12:33.314
I like it.

01:12:35.516 --> 01:12:39.220
Want to hear how maybe
they don't make love that night?

01:12:39.253 --> 01:12:40.588
Goes like this:

01:12:40.622 --> 01:12:43.158
They've decided
to sell their house,

01:12:43.190 --> 01:12:45.659
and they're fixing it up
for the realtor

01:12:45.693 --> 01:12:48.997
who they have an interview
with in the morning.

01:12:49.029 --> 01:12:53.501
The gardener,
whose usual day was Thursday,

01:12:53.534 --> 01:12:59.240
told Paula he'd be
coming back on Saturday.

01:12:59.274 --> 01:13:03.244
Why is he coming back
on Saturday?

01:13:03.278 --> 01:13:05.180
To finish his work
on the trails.

01:13:05.212 --> 01:13:07.615
I thought you said
just the minimal amount of work

01:13:07.649 --> 01:13:09.184
on the trails would be done.

01:13:09.216 --> 01:13:11.619
Well, he's doing all the trails.

01:13:11.653 --> 01:13:13.521
You lied.

01:13:13.555 --> 01:13:15.023
Look, the trails are my thing.

01:13:15.055 --> 01:13:16.891
Why go to the expense
of having them

01:13:16.925 --> 01:13:18.560
if they're not cleared
and usable?

01:13:18.592 --> 01:13:20.895
Don't call me a liar, don't!

01:13:20.929 --> 01:13:23.465
Don't make me the brunt of
everything you think is wrong!

01:13:23.497 --> 01:13:25.567
I'm sick of it! Sick!

01:13:34.074 --> 01:13:38.880
I don't want anything
you're cooking tonight.

01:13:47.755 --> 01:13:50.324
And that's why
the night will pass

01:13:50.358 --> 01:13:54.462
without any lovemaking
between them.

01:13:54.496 --> 01:13:56.297
Maybe.

01:13:56.331 --> 01:14:00.569
After a time,
he did get a handwritten message

01:14:00.601 --> 01:14:04.605
she slipped through
his slammed door.

01:14:24.359 --> 01:14:27.629
It said she had just put out
some food

01:14:27.662 --> 01:14:32.199
she had gotten earlier
from Bistro Orient,

01:14:32.233 --> 01:14:37.204
so it wasn't food
she had actually cooked.

01:14:37.238 --> 01:14:40.275
And it was ready to eat.

01:14:48.483 --> 01:14:50.619
And they watched
the rest of the hockey game.

01:14:50.652 --> 01:14:53.855
Your final score:
Kings 4, Sharks 5.

01:14:53.887 --> 01:14:56.123
Goodnight, everybody.

01:15:14.207 --> 01:15:17.144
Shedding.

01:15:17.177 --> 01:15:18.913
Keep it.

01:15:20.515 --> 01:15:23.051
There's more.

01:15:31.926 --> 01:15:34.195
Love is not love,
I don't care what they say.

01:15:34.228 --> 01:15:36.532
What is it then?

01:15:38.231 --> 01:15:42.203
It's love, but not in the way
that we think we know it.

01:15:44.706 --> 01:15:46.240
So how do you recognize it?

01:15:46.274 --> 01:15:48.810
You can't.

01:15:50.545 --> 01:15:53.916
It's unrecognizable.

01:15:56.149 --> 01:15:58.586
So then you never
really ever know.

01:15:58.619 --> 01:16:01.556
Nope, you never do.

01:16:02.957 --> 01:16:04.526
What if you think
you're in love?

01:16:04.559 --> 01:16:06.628
You're wrong.

01:16:08.328 --> 01:16:10.030
What if you think
you're not in love?

01:16:10.064 --> 01:16:12.301
Wrong again.

01:16:17.838 --> 01:16:20.108
- What did you get?
- Nothing.

01:16:20.140 --> 01:16:21.942
- Yeah, you did.
- No, I didn't.

01:16:21.975 --> 01:16:23.644
- You're lying.
- Okay.

01:16:23.677 --> 01:16:25.747
- So what did you get?
- Pill.

01:16:25.779 --> 01:16:27.581
- Pill?
- Ambien.

01:16:27.614 --> 01:16:29.717
- You take those every night?
- I take them every night.

01:16:29.751 --> 01:16:32.220
Well, that's not good.
They say not to do that.

01:16:32.252 --> 01:16:35.389
- I don't do what they say.
- What does your doctor say?

01:16:35.422 --> 01:16:36.824
"How many you want?"

01:16:36.858 --> 01:16:38.927
You have to get up early.

01:16:38.960 --> 01:16:40.395
That's why I'm taking it now.

01:16:40.427 --> 01:16:42.896
Well, aren't you supposed
to allow for six hours of sleep?

01:16:42.930 --> 01:16:45.233
Ha, I never get
six hours of sleep.

01:16:45.265 --> 01:16:48.068
I don't like you driving
to the airport.

01:16:48.101 --> 01:16:49.570
You want to drive me?

01:16:49.604 --> 01:16:51.239
You should get right into bed
after you take that,

01:16:51.271 --> 01:16:54.576
otherwise you get all drugged up and
you eat everything in the fridge.

01:16:54.609 --> 01:16:56.745
I clean up all the crumbs
when I come out in the morning.

01:16:56.778 --> 01:16:58.780
It's like animals got loose.

01:16:58.813 --> 01:17:00.315
You wonder why
you're not losing weight.

01:17:00.347 --> 01:17:02.182
Here, I know what we can do.

01:17:02.216 --> 01:17:03.685
You still have that blow gun?

01:17:03.717 --> 01:17:06.354
Load it up, count to six,
give me a running start,

01:17:06.386 --> 01:17:08.622
then nail me right as
I pass the first bedroom.

01:17:08.655 --> 01:17:12.493
- Aim for here.
- Why don't you just come to bed?

01:17:12.527 --> 01:17:13.994
What are you doing now?

01:17:14.028 --> 01:17:15.597
You have all the lights on.

01:17:15.630 --> 01:17:17.265
You're reading crime stories.

01:17:17.297 --> 01:17:18.966
- Shot of vodka.
- Turn them off.

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.101
- Goodnight.
- Don't eat all my little cones.

01:17:21.135 --> 01:17:24.172
- I won't even remember.
- You won't, you are in a state.

01:17:24.204 --> 01:17:25.673
I am putting in cameras.

01:17:25.707 --> 01:17:27.108
I'm not sleepwalking.

01:17:27.140 --> 01:17:28.942
I'm not operating
heavy machinery.

01:17:28.975 --> 01:17:33.714
- I'm happy.
- You like that feeling?

01:17:33.747 --> 01:17:39.486
This pill is like skinny-dipping
in the river Lethe,

01:17:39.520 --> 01:17:42.891
and Charon, the boatman,
rows me across.

01:17:42.923 --> 01:17:44.559
Styx.

01:17:44.591 --> 01:17:46.894
Charon rode on the river Styx.

01:17:46.927 --> 01:17:49.797
Lethe is the river
of forgetfulness.

01:17:49.831 --> 01:17:53.635
Styx is the river you cross
to get to the other side.

01:17:53.667 --> 01:17:56.203
Both of them are
in the underworld.

01:17:56.237 --> 01:17:58.539
Is that where you're headed?

01:17:58.573 --> 01:18:01.076
Underworld.

01:18:15.689 --> 01:18:18.259
So what does it
make you forget?

01:18:20.060 --> 01:18:22.596
I forget to be afraid.

01:18:24.265 --> 01:18:28.103
They come to cut me up, I'm
sleeping, I don't see a thing.

01:18:30.371 --> 01:18:33.542
Who comes to cut you up?

01:18:35.609 --> 01:18:38.145
I'll tell you a little story.

01:18:39.713 --> 01:18:43.518
- True story?
- Mm-hm.

01:18:43.551 --> 01:18:45.687
About a man.

01:18:45.720 --> 01:18:49.356
Man have name?

01:18:49.390 --> 01:18:51.192
Franco.

01:18:51.225 --> 01:18:55.697
- Call him Franco.
- Okay. What's his story?

01:18:55.729 --> 01:18:59.099
Franco was afraid
he'd be killed.

01:18:59.132 --> 01:19:02.970
- Ooh.
- At night,

01:19:03.003 --> 01:19:06.608
at the point of sleep,
of letting all his guard go,

01:19:06.640 --> 01:19:09.376
that's when he decided
they would strike.

01:19:09.409 --> 01:19:11.546
They would cross the threshold

01:19:11.578 --> 01:19:13.782
of the bedroom where
he lay in bed with his wife.

01:19:13.814 --> 01:19:15.884
Paulina.

01:19:15.917 --> 01:19:19.087
You said it was a true story.

01:19:19.119 --> 01:19:21.622
They would take him over
and reduce him

01:19:21.655 --> 01:19:24.458
to the most scarring
humiliations.

01:19:24.492 --> 01:19:27.061
- So, Frank.
- Franco.

01:19:27.094 --> 01:19:30.731
Put a revolver, five shot,
by the bed, cylinder open,

01:19:30.765 --> 01:19:32.300
just so he wouldn't
go down without a fight.

01:19:32.332 --> 01:19:34.601
But how is he even
going to get to the gun

01:19:34.635 --> 01:19:37.105
when these shadows
cross the threshold?

01:19:37.137 --> 01:19:39.573
Any movement he made
would be his last,

01:19:39.606 --> 01:19:42.076
and if he clicks
the cylinder shut,

01:19:42.109 --> 01:19:44.579
the other guy pulls
the trigger at the sound,

01:19:44.612 --> 01:19:49.082
so Franco was
one fatal step behind.

01:19:49.115 --> 01:19:51.853
He wasn't clever enough
or brave enough

01:19:51.886 --> 01:19:55.256
or armed enough to survive.

01:19:55.288 --> 01:19:57.125
His instincts let him down.

01:19:57.158 --> 01:20:00.361
His man wits didn't show up.

01:20:00.394 --> 01:20:03.097
Franco was going to die.

01:20:03.130 --> 01:20:06.201
And Paulina...

01:20:06.234 --> 01:20:08.970
Paulina is in danger.

01:20:10.304 --> 01:20:12.606
Paulina is in danger?

01:20:12.640 --> 01:20:14.609
So who is looking out for me?

01:20:14.641 --> 01:20:18.179
Nothing is seen...

01:20:18.212 --> 01:20:20.649
...but it's there.

01:20:23.751 --> 01:20:26.054
Very Rosemary's Baby.

01:20:26.087 --> 01:20:28.456
Very Psycho.

01:20:28.488 --> 01:20:32.326
Everywhere we don't look,
that's where they live.

01:20:33.728 --> 01:20:36.965
We're now in a scene
from El Topo.

01:20:36.997 --> 01:20:40.134
Oh my God, you should see
what they do to you.

01:20:40.167 --> 01:20:43.238
I can't stop it. I'm stripped,
forced to my knees,

01:20:43.270 --> 01:20:46.640
waiting to get my balls cut off
in the public square.

01:20:46.673 --> 01:20:49.143
I'm no help. At gunpoint.

01:20:49.176 --> 01:20:52.847
While they ride
around you in a circle,

01:20:52.880 --> 01:20:56.685
maniacally waving their
Gila monsters in your face.

01:20:58.351 --> 01:21:01.322
But, then...

01:21:01.354 --> 01:21:05.993
Sam Peckinpah
takes over the camera.

01:21:06.027 --> 01:21:08.829
Which means I can see

01:21:08.863 --> 01:21:13.167
that on a very below
the civilized level,

01:21:13.199 --> 01:21:15.502
you begin to like it.

01:21:15.536 --> 01:21:17.872
You enjoy the bargain.

01:21:17.904 --> 01:21:22.175
You see where the power is,
all this primitive male energy

01:21:22.208 --> 01:21:25.679
turning all of its takedown
attention towards you.

01:21:25.712 --> 01:21:28.750
I've been exposed and eliminated
as a coward in your eyes,

01:21:28.783 --> 01:21:31.619
and I understand
while I'm bleeding out

01:21:31.652 --> 01:21:34.521
and screaming in silence
and they laugh at me

01:21:34.555 --> 01:21:38.525
that you're just using
your femininity to survive.

01:21:38.559 --> 01:21:43.864
That's great because I can't use
my masculinity to survive.

01:21:43.898 --> 01:21:47.135
I reach for the gun,
they kick it away.

01:21:47.167 --> 01:21:50.438
Boom.

01:21:50.470 --> 01:21:55.042
What I wish,
and this just never happens,

01:21:55.076 --> 01:21:58.779
is that Sergio Leone
would direct this thing.

01:21:58.813 --> 01:22:01.582
Then I'd be sitting
on a dirt floor

01:22:01.614 --> 01:22:06.054
in some Spanish-style
larger room, a barn maybe.

01:22:06.087 --> 01:22:07.889
Moonlight filtering in.

01:22:07.921 --> 01:22:09.890
Sixteen other guys
in the room.

01:22:09.923 --> 01:22:11.391
I don't know who they are.

01:22:11.425 --> 01:22:13.494
Bandits faking sleep,

01:22:13.527 --> 01:22:15.663
waiting to jump me
when I nod off.

01:22:15.695 --> 01:22:17.431
But I sleep like Clint,

01:22:17.465 --> 01:22:20.068
and Clint sleeps with his hat
tipped just low enough

01:22:20.100 --> 01:22:23.003
over his eyes
so he can see out,

01:22:23.037 --> 01:22:25.907
but the shadow from the brim
of his hat conceals his eyes

01:22:25.939 --> 01:22:29.176
from everyone else
so they can't see in.

01:22:29.210 --> 01:22:33.480
His hand is draped
ever so gracefully over his gun.

01:22:33.514 --> 01:22:36.784
Cylinder already closed.

01:22:36.817 --> 01:22:39.887
Forefinger very close
to the trigger.

01:22:41.389 --> 01:22:44.826
I don't believe
Clint takes Ambien.

01:23:19.025 --> 01:23:20.827
Logic.

01:23:20.860 --> 01:23:25.298
Do you think your logic is going
to make you a better partner?

01:23:25.332 --> 01:23:27.001
Logic.

01:23:27.033 --> 01:23:28.802
No.

01:23:28.836 --> 01:23:30.171
No.

01:23:30.203 --> 01:23:32.472
No, no.

01:23:32.506 --> 01:23:34.175
No.

01:23:34.207 --> 01:23:35.643
No.

01:23:35.676 --> 01:23:38.980
No logic can be
found anywhere.

01:23:39.012 --> 01:23:42.182
Logic. No, no.

01:23:42.216 --> 01:23:44.652
And it's a good thing too.

01:23:44.685 --> 01:23:49.757
Once you think you know,
then you are lost forever.

01:23:49.789 --> 01:23:51.658
Logic.

01:23:51.692 --> 01:23:55.729
Do you think your logic is going
to make you a better partner?

01:23:55.762 --> 01:23:57.497
Logic.

01:23:57.530 --> 01:23:58.899
But look.

01:23:58.932 --> 01:24:02.036
Of course life
is beyond logic.

01:24:02.069 --> 01:24:03.504
It has to be.

01:24:03.537 --> 01:24:05.673
But look.

01:24:05.706 --> 01:24:07.208
Logic.

01:24:07.240 --> 01:24:11.546
Do you think your logic is going
to make you a better partner?

01:24:11.578 --> 01:24:13.613
No, no.

01:24:13.646 --> 01:24:17.217
And then beyond all logic, this.

01:24:17.251 --> 01:24:19.887
Then you are lost forever.

01:24:19.920 --> 01:24:22.523
No logic can be
found anywhere.

01:24:22.555 --> 01:24:24.357
Once you think you know...

01:24:24.390 --> 01:24:25.592
Logic.

01:24:25.626 --> 01:24:28.529
And then beyond all logic, this.

01:24:28.561 --> 01:24:30.631
Of course life is beyond logic.

01:24:30.663 --> 01:24:32.099
It has to be.

01:24:32.132 --> 01:24:33.533
But look.

01:24:33.567 --> 01:24:37.704
All things prepare the event.

01:25:34.127 --> 01:25:36.796
You're not going to like it.

01:25:39.365 --> 01:25:44.771
In a waiting room,
huge, like an airport.

01:25:44.805 --> 01:25:47.275
Durban.

01:25:47.307 --> 01:25:50.211
The whole city
was on lockdown

01:25:50.243 --> 01:25:55.182
and had been hit with
some bioterrorism. Plague.

01:25:56.649 --> 01:26:00.954
And all the people,
you and me included,

01:26:00.988 --> 01:26:03.858
were in varying stages
of certain death.

01:26:06.025 --> 01:26:08.695
It was just a matter of time.

01:26:08.729 --> 01:26:12.033
The teeth would soften.

01:26:12.065 --> 01:26:14.367
Blood would come out
from anywhere.

01:26:14.400 --> 01:26:17.037
The skin couldn't hold
itself together.

01:26:17.070 --> 01:26:22.175
It would just come apart
like wet tissues.

01:26:22.208 --> 01:26:24.144
One moment I could
talk to someone,

01:26:24.177 --> 01:26:27.247
the next, they couldn't
talk at all or move.

01:26:29.882 --> 01:26:32.953
We were all on
each other's death watch.

01:26:43.796 --> 01:26:46.166
Somehow, we had
gotten separated.

01:26:48.868 --> 01:26:50.837
I sought you out in the room.

01:26:54.475 --> 01:26:57.178
And finding you...

01:26:58.545 --> 01:27:02.750
...and wanting to say it
before I could no longer say it.

01:27:06.720 --> 01:27:11.592
I said, "I'm glad it was you
that I married."

01:27:19.399 --> 01:27:22.103
What was it that you said?

01:27:23.737 --> 01:27:27.875
"Glad it was you...

01:27:29.743 --> 01:27:32.413
...that I married."

01:27:36.750 --> 01:27:39.753
It's a beautiful dream.

01:28:02.109 --> 01:28:03.944
Valentine's Day!

01:28:03.976 --> 01:28:05.945
Give me a word,
one word that sums up

01:28:05.979 --> 01:28:07.847
the whole Valentine's Day
thing for you, huh?

01:28:07.881 --> 01:28:10.818
- Just one, one word only.
- Massacre.

01:28:10.850 --> 01:28:13.153
A lot of men died,
really, it's a survival thing.

01:28:13.186 --> 01:28:15.155
Don't get me started.

01:28:16.622 --> 01:28:18.458
They want us to get them
flowers and jewelry.

01:28:18.492 --> 01:28:20.860
Always buy her flowers the day
after when the prices come down.

01:28:20.894 --> 01:28:22.663
I never get her cards
or flowers or chocolate.

01:28:22.695 --> 01:28:26.466
We never make love.
It's just like any other day.

01:28:28.668 --> 01:28:30.503
What if you did all the things
you're supposed to do?

01:28:30.537 --> 01:28:32.139
- I'd still get nothing.
- What if you changed?

01:28:32.171 --> 01:28:33.807
I'll tell you exactly
what would happen.

01:28:33.841 --> 01:28:35.443
She'd go off and pick
some cage fighter

01:28:35.475 --> 01:28:37.043
who doesn't even use
complete sentences.

01:28:37.077 --> 01:28:38.378
It's so one-sided.

01:28:38.412 --> 01:28:39.980
What are we,
Knights of the Table Round?

01:28:40.012 --> 01:28:41.716
"How do I love thee?
Let me count the ways."

01:28:41.748 --> 01:28:43.451
- One.
- Oh, it's one way, all right.

01:28:43.484 --> 01:28:46.120
Hers. Don't get me started.

01:28:48.221 --> 01:28:49.622
It's an attempt
to domesticate us.

01:28:49.655 --> 01:28:50.957
Ah, but that's the bargain.

01:28:50.990 --> 01:28:52.993
Women trade their youth
and reproductive value

01:28:53.025 --> 01:28:55.395
for protection, but men trade
for protection, too.

01:28:55.429 --> 01:28:56.463
Against what?

01:28:56.497 --> 01:28:59.800
Against our wild warrior
lover selves.

01:29:02.668 --> 01:29:04.372
So, first, they want to tame us.

01:29:04.404 --> 01:29:06.474
And then they go
and find a cage guy.

01:29:06.506 --> 01:29:08.341
Then they want us
to thank them for this.

01:29:08.375 --> 01:29:11.511
The cards, the flowers,
the bracelets.

01:29:11.545 --> 01:29:12.813
That's our tribute.

01:29:12.845 --> 01:29:14.180
That's the price
of our admission,

01:29:14.213 --> 01:29:16.250
our confession
that we can't do this alone.

01:29:16.283 --> 01:29:19.053
But it's a hoodwink,
the whole meshugana.

01:29:19.086 --> 01:29:20.887
- Same, same.
- You got it.

01:29:20.921 --> 01:29:23.391
- Well, it's only once a year.
- It's forever.

01:29:23.423 --> 01:29:25.859
Don't you get me started.

01:29:30.596 --> 01:29:36.369
"Oh, who is it that my Shepherd will
be, to keep my flock from roamin'?"

01:29:36.403 --> 01:29:41.375
"It is I, my lady,
your Shepherd will be,

01:29:41.408 --> 01:29:44.178
and that field we'll rake
our home in."

01:29:46.979 --> 01:29:53.119
"Oh, Tristan, you walk the path to my
heart that I thought would never open."

01:29:53.153 --> 01:29:58.092
"Isolde, your smile
let me have for a while,

01:29:58.125 --> 01:30:03.197
for your kisses
I'll ever be hopin'."

01:30:12.005 --> 01:30:14.041
Now that

01:30:14.073 --> 01:30:16.042
is beyond

01:30:16.076 --> 01:30:17.978
all logic.

01:30:18.011 --> 01:30:20.047
And that

01:30:20.079 --> 01:30:22.048
is exactly

01:30:22.082 --> 01:30:25.052
how it happens.

01:30:25.085 --> 01:30:28.721
Which tells me that, inside,

01:30:28.755 --> 01:30:31.324
I mean, you can't see it,

01:30:31.358 --> 01:30:36.230
but inside, there's
some other little function

01:30:36.262 --> 01:30:39.300
that wants us together.

01:30:39.332 --> 01:30:42.302
No matter how hard we resist,

01:30:42.336 --> 01:30:44.605
it makes the choice.

01:30:44.637 --> 01:30:47.274
It decides.

01:30:49.542 --> 01:30:52.112
It is our fate.

01:30:54.680 --> 01:30:58.117
But you have to pay attention.

01:30:58.150 --> 01:31:02.355
And for most of us,
that is not the case.

01:31:03.990 --> 01:31:06.127
We don't.

01:31:07.860 --> 01:31:10.096
And then what?

01:31:10.130 --> 01:31:14.601
The chase never ends.

01:31:14.635 --> 01:31:19.574
The choice
never gets recognized.

01:31:21.542 --> 01:31:25.946
And we run ourselves ragged
for the rest of our lives.
