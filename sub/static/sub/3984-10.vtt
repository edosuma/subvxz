WEBVTT

02:09.520 --> 02:11.124
Brace the wind.

02:14.200 --> 02:16.726
The Lord of Light
has made good on his promise, my king.

02:16.800 --> 02:19.804
His fires have melted the snows away.

02:19.880 --> 02:21.291
The way ahead is clear.

02:21.360 --> 02:23.010
We ride for Winterfell.

02:23.120 --> 02:24.246
And you will take it.

02:26.080 --> 02:28.560
The Lord has shown me
Bolton banners burning.

02:29.320 --> 02:32.449
You will receive what is yours by right.

02:53.240 --> 02:54.844
Your Grace?

02:54.920 --> 02:56.410
Prepare to form up.

02:56.480 --> 02:57.845
Your Grace?

03:01.760 --> 03:02.841
Tell me.

03:02.920 --> 03:04.206
The men,

03:04.600 --> 03:05.931
many deserted before dawn.

03:09.120 --> 03:10.724
How many?

03:10.800 --> 03:12.723
Nearly half.

03:12.800 --> 03:15.485
All the sellswords with all the horses.

03:26.480 --> 03:27.481
Your Grace?

03:30.360 --> 03:33.807
Speak up. Can't be worse than mutiny.

04:04.480 --> 04:06.005
Cut her down.

04:19.120 --> 04:20.531
Your Grace?

04:21.279 --> 04:24.648
The Lady Melisandre
was just seen riding out of camp.

04:36.680 --> 04:38.603
Get the men into marching formation.

04:40.680 --> 04:42.648
On to Winterfell.

04:47.320 --> 04:49.084
He raised his hands,

04:50.720 --> 04:52.927
and they all stood up at once.

04:55.560 --> 04:59.087
Tens of thousands of them.
The biggest army in the world.

04:59.200 --> 05:01.202
So what are you gonna do?

05:03.680 --> 05:06.843
I'm gonna hope they don't learn
how to climb the Wall.

05:06.920 --> 05:09.400
But the dragonglass...

05:11.080 --> 05:12.570
No one's ever getting that back now.

05:13.560 --> 05:16.564
It wouldn't have mattered anyway.
Not unless we had a mountain of it.

05:16.640 --> 05:19.325
But you killed a White Walker.

05:19.400 --> 05:20.731
With Longclaw.

05:22.320 --> 05:24.561
I saw them shatter steel axes
like they were glass.

05:24.640 --> 05:27.689
- But Longclaw...
- Is Valyrian steel.

05:27.760 --> 05:30.240
How many Valyrian steel swords
are left in the Seven Kingdoms?

05:30.320 --> 05:31.810
Not enough.

05:34.760 --> 05:36.091
The first Lord Commander in history

05:36.160 --> 05:40.882
to sacrifice the lives of sworn brothers
to save the lives of wildlings.

05:44.360 --> 05:47.603
How's it feel to be friends
with the most hated man in Castle Black?

05:47.680 --> 05:49.489
You were friends with me
when I first came here.

05:49.560 --> 05:52.006
And I wasn't winning
any elections back then.

05:52.120 --> 05:53.849
Here's to us, then.

05:54.840 --> 05:56.285
Long may they sneer.

06:04.640 --> 06:05.641
What?

06:09.040 --> 06:11.281
I wanted to ask you something.

06:12.440 --> 06:14.408
To ask something of you.

06:17.200 --> 06:20.124
Send me, Gilly, and the baby to Oldtown

06:20.200 --> 06:22.441
so I can become a maester.

06:23.040 --> 06:25.122
That's what I'm meant to be. Not this.

06:25.200 --> 06:27.168
I need you here, Sam.

06:28.320 --> 06:31.563
If you leave,
who's left to give me advice I trust?

06:31.880 --> 06:32.881
Well, there's Edd.

06:37.280 --> 06:39.851
I'd be more use to you as a maester.

06:39.960 --> 06:43.248
More use to everyone
now that Maester Aemon is gone.

06:43.640 --> 06:46.484
The Citadel has the world's
greatest library.

06:46.920 --> 06:52.404
I'll learn about history, strategy, healing.

06:52.480 --> 06:55.802
And other things,
things that will help when...

06:57.240 --> 06:58.401
When they come.

07:01.920 --> 07:04.526
If Gilly stays here, then she'll die.

07:05.640 --> 07:09.247
And the baby that she
named after me will die.

07:09.320 --> 07:12.244
And I'll end up dying, too,
trying to protect them.

07:14.720 --> 07:17.564
Which means that the last thing
that I'll see in this world

07:17.640 --> 07:20.689
will be the look in her
eyes when I fail them.

07:25.080 --> 07:28.368
And I'd rather see 1,000 White Walkers
than see that.

07:43.200 --> 07:44.565
Thank you.

07:46.240 --> 07:48.561
You know at the Citadel
they'll make you swear off women, too.

07:48.720 --> 07:51.246
On, they'll bloody try.

07:54.360 --> 07:55.361
Sam.

07:56.120 --> 07:57.246
What?

07:58.680 --> 08:00.011
Sam.

08:02.280 --> 08:04.248
You had just been beaten half to death.
How did you...

08:04.400 --> 08:05.401
Oh, very carefully.

08:08.920 --> 08:12.720
I'm glad the end of the world's
working out well for someone.

08:16.920 --> 08:18.570
I'll come back.

08:20.520 --> 08:22.090
To your return.

08:22.840 --> 08:24.285
To my return.

10:03.680 --> 10:05.170
Aye, this way.

10:41.640 --> 10:42.721
My lady!

10:45.080 --> 10:46.525
Stannis.

10:46.600 --> 10:48.887
Stannis Baratheon is coming. His whole army.

10:49.000 --> 10:50.126
How do you know it's Stannis?

10:50.200 --> 10:53.249
He's carrying his flaming heart banners.
From the Blackwater.

10:54.320 --> 10:56.129
I'll never forget it.

11:32.960 --> 11:34.371
Trench here.

11:34.760 --> 11:38.560
Another one 300 yards from the castle wall.
Hurry them along.

11:39.240 --> 11:40.446
- Right, Curlew.
- Yes, sir.

11:40.520 --> 11:41.885
Dig between those two rises.

11:41.960 --> 11:43.291
- Spread out.
- I'm with you.

11:44.000 --> 11:46.128
- Archers!
- Spread out!

11:46.280 --> 11:50.490
And send out a foraging party immediately.
Siege begins at sunrise.

11:51.120 --> 11:53.407
There's not going to be a siege, Your Grace.

12:35.320 --> 12:37.084
We've got no chance!

13:47.000 --> 13:48.764
No, please, please.

14:42.800 --> 14:44.962
Bolton has women fighting for him?

14:46.120 --> 14:48.407
I don't fight for the Boltons.

14:49.640 --> 14:51.642
I'm Brienne of Tarth.

14:53.800 --> 14:56.531
I was Kingsguard to Renly Baratheon.

15:02.800 --> 15:06.361
I was there when he was murdered
by a shadow with your face.

15:09.480 --> 15:12.802
You murdered him with blood magic?

15:18.320 --> 15:19.526
I did.

15:29.000 --> 15:31.571
In the name of Renly of House Baratheon,

15:31.640 --> 15:36.282
First of His Name, rightful King
of the Andals and the First Men,

15:36.360 --> 15:39.409
Lord of the Seven Kingdoms
and Protector of the Realm,

15:39.680 --> 15:43.571
I, Brienne of Tarth, sentence you to die.

15:50.280 --> 15:52.442
Do you have any last words?

16:01.360 --> 16:03.203
Go on, do your duty.

16:21.520 --> 16:23.568
Looks like we're done here.

16:39.400 --> 16:42.404
I surrender! I surrender!

16:42.520 --> 16:44.648
And I accept your surrender.

16:56.520 --> 16:58.010
Let's head back.

16:58.120 --> 17:00.009
My wife must be lonely.

17:33.800 --> 17:35.165
My lady.

17:35.280 --> 17:37.567
I've come to escort you back
to your chamber.

17:37.640 --> 17:40.166
Go with her, please.

17:43.920 --> 17:45.729
I know what Ramsay is.

17:47.200 --> 17:49.009
I know what he'll do to me.

17:52.360 --> 17:54.567
If I'm going to die,

17:54.640 --> 17:58.008
let it happen
while there's still some of me left.

18:00.080 --> 18:01.161
Die?

18:02.480 --> 18:05.689
Who said anything about dying?
You can't die.

18:05.760 --> 18:08.491
Your father was Warden of the North.
Ramsay needs you.

18:12.080 --> 18:14.162
Though I suppose he doesn't need all of you.

18:15.160 --> 18:17.322
Just the parts he'll use to make his heir,

18:17.400 --> 18:20.688
until you've given him a boy or two,
and he's finished using them.

18:22.360 --> 18:27.366
Then he's got incredible
plans for those parts.

18:28.680 --> 18:32.571
So, shall we wait for him to come back
or should we begin now?

18:35.040 --> 18:37.042
You're leaving it to me?

18:37.280 --> 18:38.361
Good.

18:39.000 --> 18:40.240
Let's begin.

18:43.160 --> 18:44.969
Reek! Stop!

18:53.960 --> 18:55.564
Open the gate!

19:03.400 --> 19:04.447
He's coming back.

20:40.960 --> 20:43.645
I can see I have my work cut out for me.

20:44.600 --> 20:46.409
You two, out.

21:40.960 --> 21:44.043
You were the first person
on my list, you know.

21:44.320 --> 21:47.051
For killing Syrio Forel. Remember him?

21:48.440 --> 21:49.771
Probably not.

21:52.080 --> 21:54.401
I've gotten a few of the others.

21:55.400 --> 21:58.290
The Many-Faced God
stole a few more from me.

21:59.080 --> 22:01.447
But I'm glad he left me you.

22:04.840 --> 22:06.763
Do you know who I am?

22:11.080 --> 22:12.730
I can't hear you.

22:21.640 --> 22:23.927
You know who I am.

22:24.360 --> 22:25.805
I'm Arya Stark.

22:35.120 --> 22:37.122
Do you know who you are?

22:40.000 --> 22:41.490
You're no one.

22:43.080 --> 22:44.684
You're nothing.

23:28.440 --> 23:30.647
A girl has taken a life.

23:31.480 --> 23:33.050
The wrong life.

23:35.160 --> 23:37.128
I was right about her.

23:37.320 --> 23:38.367
You were.

23:40.320 --> 23:41.970
You're not ready.

23:43.920 --> 23:45.524
Not at all.

23:49.400 --> 23:52.006
That man's life was not yours to take.

23:53.400 --> 23:55.402
A girl stole from the Many-Faced God.

23:57.200 --> 23:58.929
Now a debt is owed.

24:05.520 --> 24:07.284
Only death can pay for life.

24:20.720 --> 24:22.802
No! No!

24:22.880 --> 24:25.451
No, you don't die! Don't die!

24:31.560 --> 24:33.244
Why are you crying?

24:35.320 --> 24:36.810
He was my friend.

24:36.880 --> 24:39.804
No, he wasn't. Didn't you listen to him?

24:40.640 --> 24:41.721
He was no one.

24:46.600 --> 24:48.284
But if you're...

24:50.440 --> 24:51.521
Who's this?

24:52.520 --> 24:54.249
No one at all.

24:54.760 --> 24:58.970
Just as a girl should have been
before she took a face from the hall.

25:04.080 --> 25:06.481
The faces are for no one.

25:07.080 --> 25:09.367
You are still someone.

25:11.760 --> 25:14.969
And to someone,
the faces are as good as poison.

25:28.600 --> 25:30.045
I can't see.

25:36.280 --> 25:37.930
What's happening?

25:38.960 --> 25:40.962
What's happening?

25:51.320 --> 25:53.846
- I wish you a safe journey home.
- Thank you.

25:59.000 --> 26:00.161
Forgive me, child.

26:02.640 --> 26:05.484
I wish you all the happiness in the world.

26:22.680 --> 26:24.330
Maybe I'll come visit you sometime.

26:25.280 --> 26:26.964
Maybe I'll come visit you.

26:27.040 --> 26:28.371
Don't wait too long.

26:28.480 --> 26:30.164
Got a noblewoman to marry back home.

26:31.480 --> 26:35.087
You want a good girl,
but you need the bad pussy.

26:38.800 --> 26:41.121
Whenever you're ready, my lord.

26:56.880 --> 26:58.644
Try not to lose it this time.

27:00.960 --> 27:03.167
I'll never take it off again.

27:03.880 --> 27:06.804
I know you didn't want to leave Dorne,

27:06.880 --> 27:09.087
but I'm glad you're coming home.

27:09.160 --> 27:10.571
Your mother's desperate to see you.

27:11.160 --> 27:12.969
I'm glad Trystane is coming with us.

27:13.040 --> 27:14.121
He seems like a nice boy.

27:15.600 --> 27:16.647
You're lucky.

27:17.000 --> 27:20.368
Arranged marriages are rarely so...

27:20.440 --> 27:22.044
So well arranged.

27:22.200 --> 27:23.884
Do you think Mother will like him?

27:25.200 --> 27:28.363
If she sees you're happy, I'm sure she will.

27:28.480 --> 27:30.369
And you really believe that?

27:31.160 --> 27:34.243
Have you ever known your mother
to like anyone aside from her children?

27:35.640 --> 27:37.529
She likes you.

27:37.600 --> 27:39.762
I'm not so sure about that.

27:40.400 --> 27:41.731
Listen...

27:43.920 --> 27:46.605
There's something I wanted to tell you.

27:47.360 --> 27:50.204
Something I should have told you long ago.

27:50.800 --> 27:52.040
So...

27:54.640 --> 27:57.120
Now that you've seen more of the world,

27:57.240 --> 28:02.610
you've learned how complicated
things can be, people can be.

28:03.360 --> 28:06.523
The Lannisters and the Martells
have hated each other for years,

28:06.600 --> 28:08.682
but you've fallen in love with Trystane.

28:08.760 --> 28:11.570
It was an accident, really.
I mean, what were the chances?

28:11.640 --> 28:15.804
You happen to fall in love with the man
you were assigned to marry?

28:15.920 --> 28:17.365
My point is,

28:19.560 --> 28:21.961
we don't choose whom we love.

28:22.440 --> 28:24.681
It just, well...

28:27.120 --> 28:30.442
It's beyond our control.
I sound like an idiot.

28:30.560 --> 28:31.561
No, you don't.

28:31.640 --> 28:35.440
What I'm trying to say...
What I'm trying and failing to say...

28:35.520 --> 28:36.521
I know what you're trying to say.

28:36.600 --> 28:38.125
No, I'm afraid you don't.

28:39.440 --> 28:41.010
I do.

28:44.040 --> 28:45.280
I know.

28:47.000 --> 28:48.161
About you and Mother.

28:50.680 --> 28:53.570
I think a part of me always knew.

28:54.920 --> 28:57.890
And I'm glad.

29:00.880 --> 29:03.406
I'm glad that you're my father.

29:38.480 --> 29:39.925
Myrcella?

29:43.200 --> 29:44.531
Myrcella?

29:51.440 --> 29:54.011
Myrcella? Myrcella?

31:12.480 --> 31:14.482
You love her, don't you?

31:18.640 --> 31:20.290
How could you not?

31:20.960 --> 31:23.964
Of course,
it's hopeless for the both of you.

31:24.200 --> 31:27.761
A sellsword from the fighting pits
and a disgraced knight.

31:27.840 --> 31:29.683
Neither one of you is fit
consort for a queen.

31:32.040 --> 31:35.487
But we always want the wrong woman.

31:36.600 --> 31:38.250
Does he always talk so much?

31:42.200 --> 31:43.326
Jorah the Andal.

31:45.600 --> 31:47.125
He should not be here.

31:47.200 --> 31:48.531
No, but he is.

31:48.600 --> 31:51.080
Our queen ordered him exiled from city.

31:51.160 --> 31:53.481
Our queen would be dead if not for him.

31:54.680 --> 31:57.650
It's true. And I would be
dead if not for the...

32:01.240 --> 32:02.526
little man.

32:03.000 --> 32:04.126
Dwarf.

32:04.640 --> 32:08.167
I believe that's the word.

32:08.680 --> 32:09.886
Apologies.

32:09.960 --> 32:12.645
My Valyrian is a bit nostril.

32:14.240 --> 32:15.685
A bit rusty.

32:17.720 --> 32:18.767
Thank you.

32:19.280 --> 32:20.486
I am sorry.

32:21.520 --> 32:24.046
Sorry I not there to fight for our queen.

32:24.360 --> 32:25.566
You missed a good scrap.

32:25.640 --> 32:26.971
None of that matters now.

32:27.040 --> 32:28.724
The longer we sit here bantering,

32:28.840 --> 32:31.286
the longer Daenerys is out there
in the wilderness.

32:31.360 --> 32:33.567
He's right. The dragon headed north.

32:33.720 --> 32:35.563
If we're going to find her,
that's where we'll have to go.

32:35.680 --> 32:36.761
We?

32:37.440 --> 32:38.885
You're a Lannister.

32:38.960 --> 32:41.486
The queen intends to remove
your family from power.

32:41.560 --> 32:43.324
And I intend to help her do it.

32:43.440 --> 32:45.727
You've been here
for how many days now?

32:45.800 --> 32:49.441
I've fought for her for years.
Since she was little more than a child.

32:49.520 --> 32:51.363
- You betrayed her.
- Careful now.

32:51.440 --> 32:53.920
And she exiled you. Twice, I believe.

32:54.000 --> 32:55.490
The second time, thanks to you.

32:55.560 --> 32:58.006
Don't blame me for your crimes, Mormont.

32:58.120 --> 33:00.566
He's right. Our queen exiled Jorah.

33:00.880 --> 33:03.486
And he's right. Jorah saved her life.

33:03.720 --> 33:06.929
Perhaps she feels differently about him now.
Perhaps not.

33:07.000 --> 33:08.570
The only way we'll know is if we ask her.

33:09.400 --> 33:11.767
Fine, fine. I suppose he can join us.

33:11.880 --> 33:14.611
Just as long as he promises
not to kill me in my sleep.

33:14.760 --> 33:18.003
If I ever kill you,
your eyes will be wide open.

33:18.080 --> 33:20.765
Forgive me,
but why would we bring you?

33:22.440 --> 33:23.521
Pardon me?

33:23.600 --> 33:25.523
Have you ever tracked
animals in the wilderness?

33:25.800 --> 33:28.531
Not precisely, but I have other skills
that would be useful.

33:28.600 --> 33:30.090
Can you fight?

33:30.600 --> 33:32.011
I have fought.

33:32.080 --> 33:33.684
I don't claim to be a great warrior.

33:33.840 --> 33:34.966
Are you good on a horse?

33:36.280 --> 33:37.281
Middling.

33:37.360 --> 33:38.600
So mainly you talk.

33:39.600 --> 33:41.841
And drink. I've survived so far.

33:41.920 --> 33:45.766
Which I respect, but you would not
help us on this expedition.

33:47.120 --> 33:48.929
You would help us here in Meereen, though.

33:49.880 --> 33:53.202
None of us have experience
governing a city except for him.

33:53.280 --> 33:56.523
You want to prove your value to the queen?
Prove it right here in Meereen.

33:56.600 --> 33:59.206
He's a foreign dwarf
that barely speaks the language.

33:59.280 --> 34:00.850
Why would the Meereenese listen to him?

34:00.920 --> 34:02.410
They wouldn't.

34:02.920 --> 34:04.604
They will listen to Grey Worm.

34:04.680 --> 34:06.330
I'll come with you.

34:06.440 --> 34:08.329
I'll find our queen.

34:08.440 --> 34:10.841
- You are not strong enough to go anywhere.
- I am.

34:10.920 --> 34:13.286
He is. He's the toughest man
with no balls I ever met.

34:13.880 --> 34:15.803
But you still can't go.

34:16.440 --> 34:17.851
The people believe in you.

34:17.920 --> 34:19.967
They know you speak for the queen.

34:20.520 --> 34:21.806
It's true.

34:21.880 --> 34:23.962
Only the Unsullied
can keep the peace in Meereen.

34:24.360 --> 34:27.409
If you leave,
half this city will consume the other half.

34:27.600 --> 34:28.931
And Missandei.

34:29.920 --> 34:31.684
Our queen trusts no one
more than Missandei.

34:33.000 --> 34:34.570
Certainly not me.

34:35.760 --> 34:37.409
The queen's closest confidante,

34:37.480 --> 34:39.847
the commander of the Unsullied,

34:40.480 --> 34:42.847
and a foreign dwarf with a scarred face.

34:44.159 --> 34:45.685
Good fortune, my friends.

34:45.760 --> 34:47.603
Meereen is ancient and glorious.

34:48.440 --> 34:49.601
Try not to ruin her.

34:51.520 --> 34:53.170
Looks like it's you and me, Jorah the Andal.

34:53.239 --> 34:54.685
Let's find some good horses.

34:55.560 --> 34:57.801
We have so much to talk about.

35:30.960 --> 35:32.530
Hello, old friend.

35:34.200 --> 35:38.046
I thought we were so happy together
until you abandoned me.

35:40.240 --> 35:42.686
I suppose there's no point
asking how you found me.

35:42.760 --> 35:45.331
The birds sing in the west,
the birds sing in the east,

35:45.400 --> 35:47.448
if one knows how to listen.

35:48.640 --> 35:52.645
They tell me you've already found favor
with the Mother of Dragons.

35:52.720 --> 35:55.485
Well, she didn't execute me,

35:55.560 --> 35:57.722
so that's a promising start.

35:58.600 --> 36:01.171
Now the heroes are off to find her,

36:01.240 --> 36:03.527
and I'm stuck here

36:03.640 --> 36:06.610
trying to placate a city
on the brink of civil war.

36:06.760 --> 36:08.410
Any advice for an old comrade?

36:08.520 --> 36:09.851
Information is the key.

36:09.920 --> 36:12.651
You need to learn
your enemy's strengths and strategies.

36:12.720 --> 36:15.200
You need to learn
which of your friends are not your friends.

36:17.000 --> 36:20.561
If only I knew someone
with a vast network of spies.

36:20.640 --> 36:22.005
If only.

36:24.200 --> 36:26.328
A grand old city,

36:27.280 --> 36:30.443
choking on violence, corruption, and deceit.

36:30.520 --> 36:35.890
Who could possibly have any experience
managing such a massive, ungainly beast?

36:41.920 --> 36:44.127
I did miss you.

36:45.400 --> 36:47.129
Oh, I know.

37:08.480 --> 37:10.289
We have to go home.

37:16.800 --> 37:19.644
Oh, my poor, sweet thing.

37:20.480 --> 37:21.970
Does it hurt?

37:24.800 --> 37:26.689
We have to go home.

37:29.920 --> 37:31.160
Drogon.

37:31.280 --> 37:33.647
Can you take me back to Meereen?

37:38.080 --> 37:40.082
How far did you carry me?

37:48.240 --> 37:50.925
Drogon, we need to return.

37:51.000 --> 37:52.365
My people need me.

38:24.720 --> 38:26.563
Well, there's no food.

38:27.320 --> 38:30.483
At the very least,
you could hunt us some supper.

41:08.040 --> 41:09.405
Confess.

41:13.400 --> 41:14.731
Confess.

41:26.320 --> 41:27.651
I have sinned.

41:28.520 --> 41:30.090
I see that now.

41:30.960 --> 41:33.645
How can I have been so blind for so long?

41:35.920 --> 41:38.127
I want to be clean again.

41:39.360 --> 41:40.930
I want absolution.

41:43.760 --> 41:46.764
The Crone came to me
with her lamp raised high.

41:47.760 --> 41:48.807
And by its holy light...

41:48.880 --> 41:50.325
You wish to make a confession?

41:54.800 --> 41:57.167
Once I've confessed, will I be free?

41:57.280 --> 42:00.602
Your Grace will be dealt with
according to her sins.

42:02.600 --> 42:04.728
The Mother have mercy, then.

42:07.200 --> 42:10.010
I lay with a man outside
the bonds of marriage. I confess.

42:10.280 --> 42:11.930
Name him.

42:16.120 --> 42:17.281
Lancel Lannister.

42:17.600 --> 42:20.410
Your cousin and the king's squire.

42:20.920 --> 42:23.048
- I was lonely and afraid.
- You had a husband.

42:23.280 --> 42:25.487
A husband off whoring every chance he...

42:25.560 --> 42:27.642
His sins do not pardon your own.

42:30.720 --> 42:32.768
May the gods forgive me.

42:34.640 --> 42:36.244
Other men?

42:37.760 --> 42:38.841
No.

42:39.600 --> 42:40.840
No others?

42:42.680 --> 42:43.920
No.

42:44.480 --> 42:48.087
Speaking falsehoods
before the gods is a great crime.

42:48.160 --> 42:49.571
You understand this?

42:49.640 --> 42:51.290
I do.

42:53.280 --> 42:56.841
There are those that say your children
were not fathered by King Robert,

42:57.960 --> 43:01.760
that they are bastards
born of incest and adultery.

43:01.840 --> 43:03.080
A lie.

43:03.840 --> 43:05.604
A lie from the lips of Stannis Baratheon.

43:05.680 --> 43:08.729
He wants the throne,
but his brother's children stand in his way.

43:08.800 --> 43:11.531
So he claims they are not his brother's.

43:12.080 --> 43:13.491
That filth.

43:15.160 --> 43:17.686
There is not one shred of truth to it.

43:17.760 --> 43:19.205
I deny it.

43:21.720 --> 43:22.926
Good.

43:25.120 --> 43:27.407
But these are terrible charges.

43:28.080 --> 43:30.481
And the realm must know the truth of them.

43:30.560 --> 43:35.168
If Your Grace has given honest testimony,
your trial will prove your innocence.

43:35.240 --> 43:37.208
Trial? I have confessed.

43:37.680 --> 43:39.603
To a single sin.

43:39.720 --> 43:40.881
Others you have denied.

43:41.520 --> 43:45.161
Your trial will separate the truths
from the falsehoods.

43:47.440 --> 43:49.727
I bow to the wisdom of Your High Holiness.

43:52.760 --> 43:54.410
But if I might beg

43:55.080 --> 43:57.560
for just one drop of the Mother's mercy.

43:59.960 --> 44:01.883
I haven't seen my son...

44:02.880 --> 44:05.247
I don't know how long it's been.

44:05.560 --> 44:07.608
I need to see him, please.

44:07.680 --> 44:11.241
You have taken the first step
on the path back to righteousness.

44:13.280 --> 44:15.282
In light of this,

44:15.360 --> 44:17.727
I will permit you to return to the Red Keep.

44:20.360 --> 44:21.771
Thank you.

44:22.440 --> 44:23.566
Thank you.

44:23.960 --> 44:25.610
The Mother is merciful.

44:26.280 --> 44:27.884
It is her you should thank.

44:27.960 --> 44:29.724
I will. I will.

44:30.400 --> 44:32.528
I swear it, day and night.

44:34.320 --> 44:35.560
Good.

44:39.160 --> 44:40.764
Am I free to go?

44:42.240 --> 44:44.083
After your atonement.

44:46.680 --> 44:48.170
My atonement?

47:03.320 --> 47:05.368
A sinner comes before you.

47:06.760 --> 47:09.730
Cersei of House Lannister.

47:10.720 --> 47:12.882
Mother to His Grace King Tommen.

47:13.440 --> 47:15.761
Widow of His Grace King Robert.

47:16.640 --> 47:21.567
She has committed the acts
of falsehood and fornication.

47:22.840 --> 47:25.491
She has confessed her sins

47:25.600 --> 47:27.329
and begged for forgiveness.

47:27.640 --> 47:30.007
To demonstrate her repentance,

47:30.080 --> 47:34.130
she will cast aside all pride, all artifice,

47:34.800 --> 47:37.610
and present herself as the gods made her

47:38.120 --> 47:39.531
to you,

47:40.320 --> 47:42.527
the good people of the city.

47:43.120 --> 47:45.964
She comes before you with a solemn heart,

47:46.520 --> 47:48.443
shorn of secrets,

47:49.320 --> 47:53.245
naked before the eyes of gods and men,

47:54.640 --> 47:57.291
to make her walk of atonement.

48:17.880 --> 48:21.327
Shame. Shame.

48:21.800 --> 48:23.245
Shame.

48:25.000 --> 48:26.331
Shame.

48:27.120 --> 48:28.281
Shame.

48:29.200 --> 48:30.725
Shame.

48:32.680 --> 48:34.284
Shame.

48:34.560 --> 48:35.971
Shame.

48:36.440 --> 48:37.487
Shame.

48:39.320 --> 48:40.526
Shame.

48:41.640 --> 48:42.801
Shame.

48:44.200 --> 48:46.009
Shame.

48:47.400 --> 48:48.561
Shame.

48:49.520 --> 48:50.851
Shame.

48:51.680 --> 48:53.364
Shame.

48:54.000 --> 48:55.365
Shame.

48:56.200 --> 48:57.247
Shame.

48:57.800 --> 48:59.609
Shame.

49:00.560 --> 49:01.721
Shame.

49:02.600 --> 49:03.761
Shame.

49:04.640 --> 49:06.404
Shame.

49:07.360 --> 49:08.600
Shame.

49:09.080 --> 49:10.445
- Cunt!
- Shame.

49:10.520 --> 49:11.760
- Sinner!
- Whore!

49:11.840 --> 49:13.365
- Shame.
- Whore!

49:13.720 --> 49:15.051
Shame.

49:15.720 --> 49:16.687
- Whore!
- Whore!

49:16.760 --> 49:17.886
Shame.

49:17.960 --> 49:18.961
Bitch.

49:20.560 --> 49:21.686
Shame.

49:23.200 --> 49:24.486
Shame.

49:25.560 --> 49:26.766
- Whore!
- Sinner!

49:26.840 --> 49:29.207
- Shame.
- Bitch! Brother fucker!

49:29.320 --> 49:30.810
- Whore!
- Shame.

49:32.960 --> 49:34.962
- Fuck off!
- Shame.

49:35.920 --> 49:37.001
Shame.

49:37.080 --> 49:39.321
- All hail the royal tits.
- You're a bitch!

49:39.400 --> 49:40.561
Shame.

49:40.640 --> 49:41.801
- Get her!
- Whore!

49:41.880 --> 49:43.450
- Bitch!
- Fucker!

49:43.520 --> 49:45.170
- Fucker!
- You bitch!

49:45.240 --> 49:46.730
- Shame.
- Cunt!

49:46.800 --> 49:48.245
Shame.

49:48.440 --> 49:50.727
Shame. Shame.

49:51.080 --> 49:53.208
- Brother fucker!
- Bitch!

49:53.800 --> 49:56.167
I've had half as many cocks as the queen.

49:57.480 --> 49:58.561
Shame.

49:59.520 --> 50:01.329
- Whore! Sinner!
- Slut!

50:04.520 --> 50:05.601
Shame.

50:06.840 --> 50:09.366
Shame. Shame.

50:10.080 --> 50:11.605
- Whore!
- Whore, whore.

50:13.080 --> 50:14.605
I'm a Lannister. Suck me off!

50:15.120 --> 50:16.884
- Suck me off, you bitch!
- Back!

50:17.000 --> 50:18.729
- Whore!
- Shame.

50:19.600 --> 50:20.806
Shame.

50:23.280 --> 50:27.205
Whore! Whore! Whore! Whore!

50:28.800 --> 50:30.006
Shame.

50:30.880 --> 50:32.120
Shame.

50:33.320 --> 50:34.560
Shame.

50:36.600 --> 50:37.886
Shame.

50:38.520 --> 50:39.681
Shame.

50:40.960 --> 50:41.961
Shame.

50:43.960 --> 50:45.371
- Bitch!
- Shame.

50:53.760 --> 50:55.330
Brother fucker!

50:56.440 --> 50:59.523
Shame. Shame.

51:00.840 --> 51:02.046
Shame.

51:02.480 --> 51:04.528
- Brother fucker!
- Whore!

51:04.600 --> 51:06.284
- Whore!
- Shame.

51:07.280 --> 51:09.726
Shame. Shame.

51:13.640 --> 51:15.051
Shame.

51:15.320 --> 51:16.481
Shame.

51:17.240 --> 51:18.321
Shame.

51:19.960 --> 51:21.291
Shame.

51:26.160 --> 51:27.286
Shame.

51:29.120 --> 51:31.122
- Shame.
- Fucker!

51:34.440 --> 51:36.841
Shame. Shame.

51:38.280 --> 51:39.441
Shame.

51:40.560 --> 51:41.561
Shame.

51:42.360 --> 51:43.521
Shame.

51:45.200 --> 51:47.441
Shame. Shame.

51:48.320 --> 51:49.651
Shame.

51:50.680 --> 51:53.524
Shame. Shame.

51:55.360 --> 51:56.521
Shame.

51:57.120 --> 51:58.485
Shame.

51:58.560 --> 51:59.891
Shame.

52:01.440 --> 52:02.805
Shame.

52:03.680 --> 52:04.761
Shame.

52:05.080 --> 52:06.206
Shame.

52:11.360 --> 52:12.441
Shame.

52:13.200 --> 52:14.645
Shame.

52:15.720 --> 52:18.485
Shame. Shame.

52:20.640 --> 52:21.971
Shame.

53:00.680 --> 53:01.966
Your Grace.

53:08.200 --> 53:10.282
It's good to have you back.

53:13.040 --> 53:14.610
Come.

53:14.760 --> 53:16.205
We'll take you inside.

53:16.280 --> 53:17.611
I need to have a look at those feet.

53:23.560 --> 53:28.122
May I have the honor of presenting
the newest member of the Kingsguard?

53:44.280 --> 53:47.966
If it please Your Grace,
he has taken a holy vow of silence.

53:48.040 --> 53:49.929
He has sworn that he will not speak

53:50.000 --> 53:52.810
until all His Grace's enemies are dead,

53:52.880 --> 53:55.770
and evil has been driven from the realm.

54:02.560 --> 54:04.881
Who came to your aid? Stannis.

54:04.960 --> 54:06.086
Now he needs you.

54:06.160 --> 54:07.685
We don't have enough men
to make any difference.

54:07.760 --> 54:09.250
The wildlings will make a difference.

54:09.320 --> 54:10.890
The wildlings will never fight for Stannis.

54:10.960 --> 54:13.691
- I told him before...
- You saved their bloody lives.

54:14.560 --> 54:16.562
If they're gonna live in the Seven Kingdoms,

54:16.640 --> 54:19.962
safe behind our Wall,
they ought to fight for the damn place.

54:20.040 --> 54:22.691
- It's not their fight.
- Open the gates!

54:42.520 --> 54:43.681
Stannis?

54:50.040 --> 54:52.771
Shireen? The princess?

55:47.680 --> 55:48.727
Lord Commander.

55:49.440 --> 55:52.489
It's one of the wildlings you brought back.
Says he knows your Uncle Benjen.

55:52.840 --> 55:54.205
Says he's still alive.

55:56.240 --> 55:57.924
Are you sure he's talking about Benjen?

55:58.360 --> 55:59.771
Said he was First Ranger.

56:02.120 --> 56:04.441
Said he knows where to find him.

56:10.600 --> 56:14.400
Man says he saw your uncle at Hardhome
at the last full moon.

56:14.920 --> 56:16.445
- Could be lying.
- Could be.

56:16.560 --> 56:17.800
There are ways to find out.

56:17.880 --> 56:19.803
- Where is he?
- Over there.

56:37.240 --> 56:38.651
For the Watch.

56:43.400 --> 56:44.606
For the Watch.

56:47.600 --> 56:48.806
For the Watch.

56:51.720 --> 56:53.529
For the Watch.

56:54.560 --> 56:55.891
For the Watch.

57:40.200 --> 57:41.361
Olly...

57:49.640 --> 57:51.210
For the Watch.
