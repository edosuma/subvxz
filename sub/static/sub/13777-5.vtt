WEBVTT

00:00.447 --> 00:02.031
Ta-da!
- No way.

00:02.149 --> 00:04.904
No way!
Are you kidding me?

00:05.024 --> 00:07.109
Happy sex-iversary, babe.
This is awesome!

00:07.243 --> 00:09.495
Hot tub!
Hot tub!

00:09.612 --> 00:12.414
I think this is going to do
great things for your low T

00:12.532 --> 00:15.084
situation, because you cannot
spell hot tub without

00:15.201 --> 00:17.086
a double T.
Yeah, it's just like all

00:17.203 --> 00:18.921
the focus is on my penis.
It's like Groundhog's Day,

00:19.038 --> 00:23.375
you know? Is the Kev-hog gonna pop out
and see his shadow? I don't like that.

00:23.510 --> 00:24.877
You don't like Kev-hog?
The visual.

00:25.044 --> 00:26.885
Was it the teeth?
No, it's the idea of, like, a

00:26.930 --> 00:28.690
rodent coming up.
You know, maybe I go down a

00:28.715 --> 00:30.132
different hole.
That's the problem.

00:30.266 --> 00:31.467
That's it?
Yeah.

00:31.601 --> 00:33.552
What is this?
Aboveground hot tub?

00:33.686 --> 00:36.438
Where'd you get it, at Costco?
Look it, he's laughing at us.

00:36.556 --> 00:38.474
That's rich.
Yeah, I am, actually.

00:38.608 --> 00:40.943
Just got my check today.
That is a check

00:41.060 --> 00:44.563
for $1.1 million.
Yeah, American dollars.

00:44.697 --> 00:47.399
I put it in the contract that he
couldn't give me Cuban dollars.

00:47.534 --> 00:52.488
Business. I just don't understand why
Mark Cuban wants this EBDB thing.

00:52.622 --> 00:54.656
I don't know, but he said I
get to keep the kiosk, and let

00:54.791 --> 00:56.742
me tell you, offline is where
it's at.

00:56.876 --> 00:59.578
If I'm gonna buy a book or a CD,
I want to go into a store, and

00:59.712 --> 01:01.547
I'm pretty sure the rest of the
world agrees with me.

01:01.664 --> 01:03.549
He's a millionaire.
And we live check-to-check.

01:03.666 --> 01:05.634
Jenny, I'm gonna want to buy
a house, so I will let you be my

01:05.752 --> 01:07.719
Realtor.
Thank you, Taco.

01:07.837 --> 01:09.757
What are you looking for?
Something that's, like,

01:09.889 --> 01:12.050
different than your house.
Okay, great, are you looking

01:12.091 --> 01:14.092
for, like, a craftsman or
Mediterranean?

01:14.227 --> 01:16.428
Uh, no, just better.
You know, better house,

01:16.596 --> 01:18.996
better furniture, better food.
And no kids, you know, better.

01:19.065 --> 01:20.983
Do you want someone living in
your attic who eats all your

01:21.100 --> 01:22.818
food and smokes pot
in the house?

01:22.936 --> 01:24.316
No, I don't want to run a
homeless shelter.

01:24.436 --> 01:25.176
Jesus.

01:25.401 --> 01:31.101
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync & corrections by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

01:31.221 --> 01:33.445
I never thought I would say I
work for Taco.

01:33.613 --> 01:35.531
Don't worry about it, babe.
We're going in the hot tub

01:35.665 --> 01:37.166
tonight.
Yeah. Whoa, look.

01:37.283 --> 01:39.618
Is that Pete and his
new lady? Hello.

01:39.786 --> 01:41.453
- Hey there.
- Oh, holy shit.

01:41.588 --> 01:43.038
This is crazy.
Uh, this is Rosette.

01:43.173 --> 01:44.456
These are my best friends,
Kev and Jenny.

01:44.624 --> 01:45.841
Hi.
Nice to meet you guys.

01:45.959 --> 01:47.426
Nice to meet you, too.
Um, we were just gonna jump

01:47.544 --> 01:48.961
inside for a drink, if you guys
want to join us.

01:49.128 --> 01:51.046
Oh, I would love to, but I
have to work in the morning, so

01:51.181 --> 01:52.742
I have to go home.
I have to work in the

01:52.765 --> 01:54.349
morning, so I have to go in
there, so...

01:54.467 --> 01:56.718
We might part ways here.
All right. Good night.

01:56.853 --> 01:58.333
All right.
I had a lot of fun. Thanks.

01:58.438 --> 02:00.138
I had fun, too. All right.
Talk to you soon. Bye.

02:00.306 --> 02:02.524
Okay. Whoa, whoa, okay.
See you later.

02:02.642 --> 02:03.976
Bye.
Wow.

02:04.110 --> 02:05.978
She's cute.
Come on, let's go inside.

02:06.112 --> 02:08.030
- Get...
- Dude, it's so great to

02:08.146 --> 02:09.815
- have you back from Korea.
- Yeah, we'll see for

02:09.983 --> 02:12.618
how long. They're gonna send me back, I
know it. Yeah, I tried to contact you

02:12.735 --> 02:14.870
offline, but your MyFace page
must be broken.

02:14.988 --> 02:16.872
Oh, I was using the Korean
MyFace page.

02:16.990 --> 02:18.991
Oh, damn it.
Well, listen, now that you're

02:19.125 --> 02:20.826
back, let me ask you a quick
question.

02:20.994 --> 02:22.911
It's week five, right?
Russell is on fire.

02:23.046 --> 02:25.747
Coming up against me, and I got
some choices to make.

02:25.882 --> 02:27.799
Check it out, right?
I got Montee Ball, Stephen

02:27.917 --> 02:30.277
Jackson, Trent Richardson and
Zac Stacy, and I'm just trying

02:30.386 --> 02:32.254
to figure out, should I be
playing, like, three running

02:32.388 --> 02:34.589
backs or should I put, like, a
wide receiver in my flex?

02:34.591 --> 02:35.924
I don't know.
Here's what I would say.

02:36.059 --> 02:38.010
You got Denver versus the
Cardinals; Montee Ball's good

02:38.144 --> 02:39.761
for at least one.
Okay.

02:39.896 --> 02:41.856
Philly versus the Rams,
I would go with Zac Stacy.

02:41.981 --> 02:44.381
Now, conventional wisdom says
you want to play a running back

02:44.484 --> 02:46.435
at your flex position, but I
think that Golden Tate is gonna

02:46.569 --> 02:48.570
light up the Buffalo Bills
defense.

02:48.688 --> 02:50.689
Oh, I didn't even think about
playing Golden Tate.

02:50.857 --> 02:52.774
Golden Tate is still my
favorite cereal.

02:52.909 --> 02:54.860
This is awesome.
Thank you so much for this.

02:54.994 --> 02:57.235
Andre, it's my pleasure.
You're like my personal charity,

02:57.330 --> 02:59.748
except your disease is your
horrible fashion sense.

02:59.866 --> 03:02.000
Oh. Oh.
Ruxin!

03:02.118 --> 03:04.002
Hey, welcome back!
Hey.

03:04.120 --> 03:06.038
Oh, look, it's Andre's
shit list.

03:06.205 --> 03:07.923
Uh, actually, no, but I have
a question for you, right?

03:08.041 --> 03:11.627
Okay. Do you think I should play Golden
Tate? Hold on! I just gave you a

03:11.761 --> 03:13.845
very thoughtful response, and
now you're asking someone else?

03:13.963 --> 03:16.014
Are you doing that again,
Andre? I told you not to

03:16.132 --> 03:18.517
be an advice slut.
I'm not being an advice slut.

03:18.635 --> 03:20.035
He just gave me a tip.
It was a tip.

03:20.136 --> 03:21.853
I didn't give him just the tip.

03:21.971 --> 03:24.389
I fully penetrated his mind.
In fact, I cream-pied him with

03:24.524 --> 03:28.810
ideas. Okay, he did not cream-pie me.
You did not cream-pie me.

03:28.945 --> 03:32.064
Enough. We have our own big
news, okay?

03:32.231 --> 03:35.233
The MacArthurs have a hot tub.
Yep, a hot tub.

03:35.401 --> 03:37.152
And I'm pretty excited about it.

03:37.287 --> 03:38.620
You know what, guys, you can
just stop that.

03:38.738 --> 03:40.656
I already told them you got an
aboveground hot tub, so...

03:40.790 --> 03:42.457
That's irrelevant.
That doesn't make a difference

03:42.575 --> 03:44.076
at all.
No, it's very relevant.

03:44.210 --> 03:46.461
There are two kind of people in
the world, people who have a hot

03:46.579 --> 03:49.665
tub that is in the ground and
other people who are worried

03:49.799 --> 03:52.467
that a tornado is gonna take
their aboveground hot tub away

03:52.585 --> 03:54.386
from the trailer park that they
live in.

03:54.504 --> 03:56.054
You guys are a bunch of
ruiners, okay?

03:56.172 --> 03:58.006
And you're not even invited into
our hot tub. Pete.

03:58.141 --> 04:01.727
Yeah! Pete! You and Rosette, in the hot
tub. No, I'm not sure I'm ready to

04:01.844 --> 04:03.478
go there with her just yet.
But I saw you guys

04:03.596 --> 04:05.180
holding hands.
That's kind of the issue.

04:05.315 --> 04:07.099
She's been wanting to hold hands
since, like, day one of the

04:07.266 --> 04:08.706
relationship.
Feels a little forward.

04:08.818 --> 04:11.403
It's oddly personal.
Yeah, holding hands is the

04:11.521 --> 04:15.107
worst. That's not where the hand wants
to be. I think hand holding is a

04:15.274 --> 04:17.608
really lovely gesture.
It makes me feel nice.

04:17.744 --> 04:19.827
I can't hold hands with
Sofia, 'cause it's just like

04:19.946 --> 04:23.782
this supple, soft magic.
Oof.

04:23.950 --> 04:26.835
That's crazy.
I actually miss Sofia.

04:26.953 --> 04:28.954
I'm excited to see her tonight.
Wait a minute, you just got

04:29.122 --> 04:31.289
back from Korea.
You haven't even gone home to

04:31.424 --> 04:33.425
see your wife yet?
No, I told her my flight was

04:33.543 --> 04:35.460
getting in later so I could come
here, have a drink, relax,

04:35.595 --> 04:39.131
loosen up all the kimchi that
plagues my insides, hit the can

04:39.265 --> 04:43.018
here, empty the tank, no heavy
lifting at home. Yeah.

04:43.136 --> 04:45.303
Gross.
So if you guys will excuse

04:45.438 --> 04:47.439
me, I'll see you in a few.
Why do you have Korean baby

04:47.557 --> 04:49.441
wipes?
You guys have never used

04:49.559 --> 04:51.560
Korean baby wipes?
I use these bad boys, cleans me

04:51.694 --> 04:53.779
up all pretty, and I walk around
like a little toddler in a

04:53.896 --> 04:57.232
tuxedo. Why don't you just use toilet
paper like the rest of the world?

04:57.367 --> 04:59.568
Let me ask you a question.
Do you pick up mud with a dry

04:59.652 --> 05:03.455
towel or a wet towel?
I use my hands.

05:03.573 --> 05:06.208
Oh, that was quick.

05:06.325 --> 05:08.493
Sorry about that.
Oh, you just got a little

05:08.661 --> 05:10.545
excited.
I tried all my methods, you

05:10.663 --> 05:12.504
know what I mean?
I thought about Kevin winning

05:12.582 --> 05:14.332
the league.
I thought about Rafi moving in.

05:14.467 --> 05:16.334
I thought about us having
another kid.

05:16.469 --> 05:18.336
Usually that just
stops it.

05:18.471 --> 05:24.176
Honey, just go to sleep.
Sorry.

05:27.297 --> 05:31.888
And the kimchi is back.
Use the bathroom downstairs.

05:32.008 --> 05:33.488
Downstairs has the weird
black toilet.

05:33.551 --> 05:35.687
It creeps me out.
Downstairs.

05:36.603 --> 05:37.915
It's gorgeous, huh?
Yeah.

05:38.035 --> 05:40.456
This is the life.
Ugh, don't touch my foot.

05:40.574 --> 05:43.075
I'm sitting on your foot.
So, Ruxin, what inspired you

05:43.243 --> 05:47.059
to join us lowly aboveground
hot tub people?

05:47.179 --> 05:50.098
My wife is just too hot, and
I have been gone too long, and I

05:50.265 --> 05:52.483
keep going offsides.
You got to cut down on those

05:52.601 --> 05:54.485
false starts, boy.
That's why I'm in this

05:54.603 --> 05:58.606
disgusting aboveground cesspool; I'm
hoping to soft-boil the eggs. Really?

05:58.774 --> 06:00.525
Why would you want to do that?
I got to slow my roll a

06:00.659 --> 06:02.276
little bit.
It's like making the team run

06:02.411 --> 06:04.742
suicides before a game so that
they're not too excited.

06:04.992 --> 06:08.199
Pigs in a blanket!
Wow.

06:08.333 --> 06:11.169
Wow.
Stare much?

06:11.286 --> 06:13.504
What? No, no.
I'm hungry. I was staring at

06:13.622 --> 06:15.873
the pigs in a blanket.
You're a pig in a blanket.

06:16.008 --> 06:17.925
I can't wait to try this hot
tub.

06:18.043 --> 06:20.595
Oh, wow.
This is really nice.

06:20.713 --> 06:23.381
Yeah, it's not bad, actually.
Right? Let's have a toast.

06:23.515 --> 06:25.883
Yes. Kevin and Jenny finally
made it to the middle class.

06:26.018 --> 06:27.885
Thank you, thank you.
Cheers.

06:28.020 --> 06:30.104
No.
Jenny, I just finished the

06:30.222 --> 06:32.383
tour of your house, and I've
compiled a list of all the

06:32.474 --> 06:34.559
things I do not want in my
new house.

06:34.693 --> 06:36.561
Taco, are you using that Mark
Cuban check to write notes?

06:36.695 --> 06:39.530
Yeah, not only is it
$1.1 million, but it's also a

06:39.648 --> 06:42.734
great notepad.
Ooh, I do not want one of these

06:42.868 --> 06:45.486
in my new house.
Some people are just really

06:45.621 --> 06:47.488
desperate to bathe outside, I
guess.

06:47.623 --> 06:49.983
What, have you guys just never
been clean your entire lives?

06:50.042 --> 06:53.628
Wow.
Oh, crap.

06:53.746 --> 06:57.498
Now I got to dry that off.
Ah, who needs that guy, huh?

06:57.666 --> 06:59.417
We got a hot tub party
happening here.

06:59.551 --> 07:01.311
Come here, baby.
Babe, this is what we wanted

07:01.336 --> 07:03.504
when we got the hot tub.
I bet it's exactly what you

07:03.672 --> 07:05.506
wanted.
That was an accident.

07:05.674 --> 07:09.977
Mm-hmm. I'm just enjoying being in
here with you, holding your hand.

07:10.095 --> 07:12.847
Your hands are so soft and
supple and sexy.

07:12.981 --> 07:15.066
It just turns me on.
Kevin, I'm not holding your

07:15.184 --> 07:19.187
hand right now.
Um, it's actually my hand.

07:19.321 --> 07:23.241
Huh?
Oh, God, Kevin!

07:23.358 --> 07:25.827
It was super fun watching you
ogle Sofia all night long.

07:25.944 --> 07:28.362
No, I was ogling the moment,
babe.

07:28.530 --> 07:30.998
The moment took over, and you
know, her body got in the way.

07:31.116 --> 07:33.534
Kevin!
Babe, you are the only person

07:33.669 --> 07:36.420
in the world that I'm attracted
to, that I want to be with, that

07:36.538 --> 07:38.706
I love.
Really? Prove it.

07:38.841 --> 07:40.541
Prove it?
Yeah.

07:40.709 --> 07:42.460
What? Whoa. Right now?
Mm-hmm.

07:42.594 --> 07:44.262
You're putting a lot of
pressure on the Kev-hog.

07:44.379 --> 07:47.048
Yeah, I am.
Come on out, Kev-hog.

07:47.182 --> 07:49.717
Oh, no, don't do that.

07:49.852 --> 07:51.719
I get it now.
It-It's, yeah, it's not good.

07:51.887 --> 07:53.688
Sooey!
Is that a boar?

07:53.806 --> 07:55.940
Hello!
Come out and play!

07:56.058 --> 07:57.892
Don't yell at him.
You're scaring him.

07:58.060 --> 08:02.864
Please. Well, now he's-he's in the
cave now. He's not coming out.

08:02.981 --> 08:07.401
Six more weeks of winter.

08:07.536 --> 08:09.403
No more.
We're done with it.

08:09.538 --> 08:13.291
No more holding hands. Wait, so it's my
fault that you held Sofia's hand? Yes!

08:13.408 --> 08:15.543
Yes, 'cause now she wants to
hold hands with me, and they're

08:15.661 --> 08:17.741
so delicate and beautiful.
It's like a Peyton Manning

08:17.746 --> 08:19.747
hard count.
She keeps drawing me offsides.

08:19.915 --> 08:22.667
"Hold my hand!" and I jump.
It's a disease, Pete.

08:22.801 --> 08:25.419
And you are like patient zero,
so get it under control!

08:25.587 --> 08:27.221
Get it under control.
Okay, I don't want to hold

08:27.339 --> 08:29.379
hands, anyway. It's fine.
Then don't do it! No more!

08:29.424 --> 08:32.559
Then don't hold hands. Shake on it, no
more hand holding. Okay, we're shaking.

08:32.678 --> 08:34.261
Here we go.
No more hand holding.

08:34.395 --> 08:35.676
Do we all agree?
Yes, we're done.

08:35.764 --> 08:37.097
Look me in the eye.
Do you agree with me, no more

08:37.265 --> 08:38.666
hand holding?
No more holding hands!

08:38.683 --> 08:40.124
We gonna hold hands anymore?
No more!

08:40.152 --> 08:41.434
Hold my hand and look me in
the eye and say no more hand

08:41.602 --> 08:43.154
holding.
No more holding hands.

08:43.272 --> 08:45.156
All right, that's it.
I got bigger problems

08:45.274 --> 08:46.994
than you idiots.
I can't even perform for my

08:47.109 --> 08:48.710
wife right now.
Ooh, still having trouble

08:48.827 --> 08:50.467
down south, huh?
I'm thinking about taking

08:50.612 --> 08:52.780
that andro lube and just
smearing it all over my junk.

08:52.915 --> 08:55.366
This time, I'm gonna take a
Q-tip and I'm gonna go into the

08:55.500 --> 08:58.169
pee hole.
Hey, man, maybe the problem

08:58.287 --> 09:01.339
isn't what's in your pants.
Maybe the problem is your pants.

09:01.456 --> 09:03.341
Hi, Russell.
Couldn't help but overhear

09:03.458 --> 09:05.459
what you're going through, and I
can tell you that all these

09:05.627 --> 09:07.962
problems can be solved by a
thinner gauge of pant.

09:08.096 --> 09:12.466
Really? Yeah, I'm talking
about love pants. Love pants?

09:12.601 --> 09:14.635
What are love pants?
They make pants out of

09:14.803 --> 09:18.973
microfibers so thin it's like a
spider spun a glorious thin web

09:19.141 --> 09:22.109
all around your dick and balls.
I'm telling you, you're gonna

09:22.227 --> 09:24.312
experience the world in a whole
new way.

09:24.479 --> 09:26.898
Especially crowded subway rides.
Really?

09:27.032 --> 09:29.200
And horsing around at the dog
park. Watch this.

09:29.318 --> 09:31.786
Did you feel that?

09:31.904 --> 09:36.040
No. You would if you were wearing love
pants. You would feel the sweet caress

09:36.158 --> 09:38.159
of my hot breath.
So you're not a sex addict

09:38.293 --> 09:40.494
anymore, huh, Russell?
No, not at all.

09:40.662 --> 09:42.580
Hey, whose wine is that?
Uh, it's Andre's.

09:42.714 --> 09:44.165
Oh.
Where is Andre?

09:44.333 --> 09:45.800
I just saw him over
by the jukebox.

09:45.918 --> 09:47.918
So you guys are definitely
saying that Montee Ball?

09:48.003 --> 09:50.004
Watch, he's getting advice
from random dudes now.

09:50.172 --> 09:52.006
Andre, come here.
Get over here!

09:52.174 --> 09:53.894
I'll be right back.
All right, see you, man.

09:53.976 --> 09:55.176
What's wrong with you?
What's up, dudes?

09:55.344 --> 09:56.644
What are you doing?
What? What do you mean?

09:56.762 --> 09:59.122
I spent my whole lunch hour
going over your shit lineup, and

09:59.147 --> 10:01.308
now you're over there getting
your mind stuffed by some

10:01.316 --> 10:03.100
randos?
Ah, that? That?

10:03.235 --> 10:04.518
Come on, that's nothing.
It was casual.

10:04.653 --> 10:07.855
It wasn't serious. Oh, it always starts
off casual. Yeah, always casual,

10:07.990 --> 10:09.907
Mr. All-Input Andre.
I can take a lot of input.

10:10.025 --> 10:12.360
I like to get advice from
multiple dudes.

10:12.494 --> 10:14.495
When you get advice from a
guy, you're getting advice from

10:14.613 --> 10:16.998
every guy that that guy has ever
gotten advice from.

10:17.115 --> 10:19.200
You're being ridiculous.
I'm not gonna bring their advice

10:19.334 --> 10:22.036
over to this group, okay?
I keep you guys protected.

10:22.204 --> 10:24.284
And by the way, you're
spreading your terrible advice

10:24.373 --> 10:26.207
over to them.
You're probably giving that

10:26.375 --> 10:28.376
group of guys Draids.
It's all fun and games until

10:28.510 --> 10:30.544
someone plays a quarterback on a
bye week.

10:30.679 --> 10:32.763
No more advice coming from us.
You have an addiction.

10:32.881 --> 10:34.849
You need to deal with it.
Guys, come on!

10:34.967 --> 10:38.636
They don't mean anything to me!
Andre, I'm so sorry.

10:38.770 --> 10:40.730
I didn't know that you suffered
from my addiction.

10:40.772 --> 10:42.223
I don't suffer from your
addiction.

10:42.391 --> 10:44.111
It's about fantasy.
It seems like a fantasy,

10:44.142 --> 10:48.980
doesn't it? Until you start working at
a Montreal sex club as "The Toilet."

10:49.114 --> 10:51.032
Did you do that?
For three years.

10:51.149 --> 10:52.700
Okay, look...
Don't do it, though.

10:52.818 --> 10:54.118
I'm not gonna become a
toilet, thank you very much.

10:54.236 --> 10:55.619
Good. Don't. Don't.
I'm not. Okay. Okay.

10:55.737 --> 10:58.539
You could make good money.
The manager's name is Rick.

11:00.077 --> 11:01.961
This is sort of a house
education for you, Taco.

11:02.079 --> 11:04.247
It'll help you know what you
like, what you don't like.

11:04.415 --> 11:07.663
Yeah, well, I definitely
don't like this.

11:07.783 --> 11:09.651
It's a little too lower middle
class for me.

11:09.785 --> 11:12.120
I can see that.
Ooh, I like that, though.

11:12.238 --> 11:16.074
The beer, that's good. Can I help
you with something? Yes, actually.

11:16.208 --> 11:19.544
Does your place have a bathroom?
Yes.

11:19.662 --> 11:22.247
Wow, okay.
All right, I'll be back.

11:22.415 --> 11:24.416
Hey, you stole Chalupa's baby
wipes?

11:24.550 --> 11:26.751
Yeah, you're my Realtor.
Your wipes are my wipes.

11:26.919 --> 11:29.671
I really like the space.
I just hate the stuff in the

11:29.805 --> 11:31.756
space.
Oh, well, that all goes as

11:31.891 --> 11:33.758
soon as you move in.
Yeah, and I have a little

11:33.893 --> 11:37.929
question. That person's not gonna be
in any house that I buy, right? Andre?

11:38.097 --> 11:41.850
Yeah. I mean, he'll be there if you
invite him. No, of course not.

11:41.984 --> 11:43.852
Well, then no, he won't be.
Oh, right.

11:43.986 --> 11:45.487
Oh, actually, Jenny, now
that you're here, I have a quick

11:45.604 --> 11:47.205
question.
I asked out this girl who works

11:47.273 --> 11:48.940
in the hat store at Barney's,
and she's super hot and she's

11:49.108 --> 11:50.775
super hip, and I just want to
find a really cool place to take

11:50.943 --> 11:53.945
her. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, you asked
me for the same advice last night.

11:54.113 --> 11:55.954
I was on the phone with you for,
like, an hour!

11:56.031 --> 11:57.449
It's a different perspective,
that's all!

11:57.616 --> 11:59.784
Andre, no advice for you!
You're cut off!

11:59.952 --> 12:02.704
And I'm not buying your place.
It's not for sale.

12:02.838 --> 12:04.789
No deal!
This lovely home is 2,800

12:04.957 --> 12:07.792
square feet, three bedroom,
three bath, two miserable human

12:07.960 --> 12:11.296
beings.
Nope. Not interested.

12:11.464 --> 12:13.214
No?
Hello.

12:13.349 --> 12:14.933
Oh, hey, guys.
It's 7:00 a.m.

12:15.050 --> 12:16.684
What are you doing in our house?
Did he not talk to you

12:16.802 --> 12:18.720
about this?
Thank you for the open house.

12:18.854 --> 12:20.772
Appreciate it.
There is no open house.

12:20.890 --> 12:22.390
Any unlocked house is an open
house.

12:22.525 --> 12:24.525
The house isn't unlocked.
You don't know much about

12:24.527 --> 12:26.895
real estate.
This place is white-hot garbage.

12:27.029 --> 12:29.113
Kind of reminds me of your
place.

12:29.231 --> 12:33.318
It is my place. You said you wanted to
look at comps. This would be a comp.

12:33.486 --> 12:35.653
Yeah, well, I still hate it.
It's good to know what I don't

12:35.788 --> 12:40.241
like, though.
Oh, this commission better be

12:40.376 --> 12:42.827
worth it.
Good love pants are hard to

12:42.995 --> 12:46.331
find, but this is my spot, and
my guy, November, he will hook

12:46.499 --> 12:48.633
you up.
Ah, Russell, welcome back.

12:48.751 --> 12:50.885
This must be the square friend
you were talking about.

12:51.003 --> 12:52.887
The friend that you were talking
about.

12:53.005 --> 12:55.139
These are going to loosen you
right up.

12:55.257 --> 12:58.893
This was actually made from real
silk worms in Peru that were

12:59.011 --> 13:01.513
raised in a vat of ayahuasca.
Okay, thank you.

13:01.647 --> 13:04.516
I wish you well. Nama-star.
Um, all right,

13:04.650 --> 13:06.518
I'll try them on, then.
"Underwear must be worn to try

13:06.652 --> 13:08.269
on pants"?
Isn't that a given?

13:08.404 --> 13:09.854
November, is that because of me?

13:09.989 --> 13:11.906
Oh, it's absolutely because
of you.

13:12.024 --> 13:14.075
Recovery is a process.
Okay, um, I'm gonna try the

13:14.193 --> 13:16.694
pants on.
Hey, so now that he's gone,

13:16.829 --> 13:18.696
I wanted to ask you a little
first-date advice.

13:18.831 --> 13:21.032
I met this girl and I want to
know, where do you think I

13:21.116 --> 13:23.001
should take her?
Hot tub.

13:23.118 --> 13:24.536
Hot tub?
It's like a giant bowl of

13:24.670 --> 13:26.704
soup without the noodles.
You don't have to explain

13:26.872 --> 13:28.756
what a hot tub is.
We're the noodles.

13:28.874 --> 13:30.842
I know what a hot tub is.
It's like a broth.

13:30.960 --> 13:33.344
Very déclassé, okay?
I want something a little bit

13:33.462 --> 13:37.432
more sophisticated. What, like
a restaurant with food? Yeah.

13:37.550 --> 13:39.634
Girls don't like eating, man.
They like to sit in boiling

13:39.768 --> 13:41.686
hot water.
I'm not taking her on a hot

13:41.804 --> 13:43.221
tub date.
What am I gonna do, take her to

13:43.389 --> 13:45.723
my gym or break into Kevin and
Jenny's house and, like, use

13:45.858 --> 13:47.559
their hot tub?
A forbidden hot tub?

13:47.693 --> 13:50.895
That's the best kind of hot tub.
It's illicit.

13:51.030 --> 13:54.399
Yeah, all right.
Uh, I don't think these are

13:54.567 --> 13:56.234
gonna work.
I mean, what-what is this?

13:56.402 --> 13:58.236
I feel like I look like Aladdin.
Let me tell you something

13:58.404 --> 14:00.321
about these pants, these pants
gave me a son that I've never

14:00.456 --> 14:02.574
met and an arrest record in
Maryland.

14:02.741 --> 14:04.659
I don't feel anything
different down there.

14:04.793 --> 14:06.911
If they're too thick for you,
we can go thinner. November?

14:07.046 --> 14:08.913
Yes?
We've got to go thinner.

14:09.048 --> 14:12.083
Well, these are the thinnest
that I've got.

14:12.251 --> 14:14.919
Legally, I'm not allowed to call
them pants.

14:15.054 --> 14:17.555
They're a trouser-cut stocking.
I mean, take a look at that.

14:17.673 --> 14:19.591
Wow.
Oh, yeah!

14:19.758 --> 14:21.426
All right, well, if I'm
worried about feeling something

14:21.594 --> 14:23.261
down there, why don't I just go
without underwear?

14:23.395 --> 14:25.430
That's too much sensitivity.
You couldn't handle it, okay?

14:25.564 --> 14:28.933
You don't want to fly too close
to the sexual sun and melt your

14:29.101 --> 14:32.103
penis off like Dickarus.
I think you mean Icarus.

14:32.237 --> 14:35.023
What's an Icarus?

14:35.157 --> 14:37.825
Jenny, you're all out of
wipes, and your indoor outhouse

14:37.943 --> 14:40.445
is broken.
My beer and cheese breakfast is

14:40.579 --> 14:43.081
just sitting there.
You guys keep flushing all of

14:43.198 --> 14:45.450
the wipes down the toilet!
They are not meant to be

14:45.584 --> 14:49.921
flushed. You are going to break the toilet.
This whole house is a broken

14:50.039 --> 14:51.923
toilet.

14:52.041 --> 14:53.508
Hey, babe.
Hey, what's going on?

14:53.626 --> 14:57.545
I am dealing with your brother, who
just broke our indoor outhouse. What?

14:57.680 --> 14:59.714
Because everyone's flushing
all these wipes, our plumbing is

14:59.848 --> 15:02.100
going to explode.
Forget about Taco, forget

15:02.217 --> 15:04.268
about the plumbing.
My mom's gonna pick the kids up

15:04.386 --> 15:06.554
in a little bit, and we are
gonna celebrate a proper

15:06.689 --> 15:09.641
sex-iversary at a hotel this
evening.

15:09.775 --> 15:11.936
Who knows where the night's
gonna take us, but I have a

15:11.977 --> 15:13.895
sneaking suspicion it's gonna
take us to sex.

15:14.029 --> 15:15.480
You think you can make
that happen?

15:15.648 --> 15:17.768
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
The Kev-hog is ready to come out

15:17.816 --> 15:19.734
of his hole, baby.
It's springtime.

15:19.868 --> 15:21.986
Oh, I still don't love that
metaphor, but I'm very excited.

15:22.154 --> 15:24.372
I'll see you later, okay?
All right, I love you.

15:24.490 --> 15:26.491
Love you.
Love pants, huh?

15:26.625 --> 15:31.663
Game time.
Wear your underwear!

15:31.797 --> 15:36.334
Remember, Dickarus!

15:36.468 --> 15:39.921
What does that guy know?
The sex addict.

15:40.055 --> 15:42.590
He's gonna get chubs all the
time.

15:42.725 --> 15:46.427
I need all the help I can get.
Ooh!

15:46.562 --> 15:51.516
This is a whole new world.
Oh.

15:51.650 --> 15:58.189
Oh, my God, there's movement
already. All right, time to take this

15:58.323 --> 16:00.108
Kev-hog for a walk.

16:02.000 --> 16:08.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

16:10.035 --> 16:13.454
Kevin?
Oh, Sofia, hey.

16:13.589 --> 16:15.540
How are you?
Good, how are you?

16:15.674 --> 16:17.542
I'm great.
Oh, it's so nice to see you.

16:17.710 --> 16:19.544
Good to see you.
Where's Ruxin?

16:19.712 --> 16:21.262
Oh, he's on his way.
He loves the flower mart.

16:21.380 --> 16:22.820
He told us how much he loves
it here.

16:22.881 --> 16:24.215
Yeah, what are you doing here?

16:24.383 --> 16:26.217
I'm actually on my way to see
Jenny, because it's kind of our

16:26.351 --> 16:29.020
anniversary, sort of.
That's cool.

16:29.138 --> 16:33.024
Yeah. That's why you're wearing these
snazzy pants. Oh-ho, no, no, no.

16:33.142 --> 16:35.977
Uh, no, I'm actually, you know,
just gonna pick up some flowers.

16:36.111 --> 16:39.230
We got a hotel room.
Oh, you're so romantic.

16:39.398 --> 16:42.116
She's so lucky to have you.
Thank you. I know!

16:42.234 --> 16:44.068
That's what I tell her.
I want to help you.

16:44.203 --> 16:45.903
Really?
Come on, let's go.

16:46.038 --> 16:49.123
This is gonna be fun.
Okay, so what flowers do you

16:49.241 --> 16:51.743
usually get her?
Uh, about $50, $60 worth.

16:51.910 --> 16:55.413
Okay, I am gonna hook you up.
This slipper orchid.

16:55.581 --> 16:59.300
That is so beautiful.
Look at this one. Wow.

16:59.418 --> 17:01.803
Mm-hmm.
Oh, excuse me.

17:01.920 --> 17:04.137
Sorry, my purse.
No, no.

17:04.256 --> 17:06.057
Back over here.
No, man, come on.

17:06.175 --> 17:07.759
Get a couple of these.
Come on.

17:07.893 --> 17:09.761
Oh, God, okay.
It's really crowded here.

17:09.895 --> 17:12.012
Yeah, yeah, it is.
Oh, wow, okay. Hi.

17:12.146 --> 17:13.564
No, no, no.
We're gonna find it.

17:13.682 --> 17:15.098
We're gonna find what you're
looking for.

17:15.233 --> 17:17.101
Okay. God.
I should've worn underwear.

17:17.269 --> 17:20.605
Let's go over here.
Ooh, look at these.

17:20.739 --> 17:24.075
I've never seen these before.
Wow. Oh, excuse me.

17:24.193 --> 17:28.579
Excuse me. Um, let me see what's
behind you. I think... Oh, wow.

17:28.697 --> 17:30.615
This is a tiger orchid.
She would love these.

17:30.783 --> 17:33.000
Great. Just get them.
These are the ones that you

17:33.118 --> 17:35.002
want to get.
This is really beautiful.

17:35.120 --> 17:36.754
No, you don't need it.
You don't need it, man.

17:36.872 --> 17:38.623
Come on.
Oh, sorry.

17:38.791 --> 17:42.126
Oh, no. No!
No.

17:42.294 --> 17:44.629
Excuse me.
Oh, God. Oh, God.

17:44.763 --> 17:46.714
Oh, God.
That's tight.

17:46.849 --> 17:49.100
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

17:49.218 --> 17:51.803
Oh, no.

17:51.970 --> 17:56.440
Kevin?
Kevin?

17:56.558 --> 18:00.895
Dickarus!

18:01.029 --> 18:04.482
Did you just drop hot soup on
my wife?!

18:04.650 --> 18:07.034
Oh, my God!
I got to get out of here.

18:07.152 --> 18:08.820
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

18:08.987 --> 18:10.071
Babe!
Stay there.

18:10.205 --> 18:11.405
He came on me!
Don't come any closer.

18:11.540 --> 18:12.740
I'll get you a hose!
Babe!

18:12.875 --> 18:14.575
Oh, Sofia Ruxin,
forever unclean!

18:14.710 --> 18:16.494
Babe, please!

18:18.204 --> 18:20.366
We could go to a movie.
You've been holding that

18:20.486 --> 18:21.770
empty cup for, like, 20 minutes.
When are you gonna

18:21.905 --> 18:24.823
throw it away? You know, I can't
find a trashcan. Oh, there's one.

18:24.941 --> 18:26.742
Oh, great, thank you.

18:29.112 --> 18:31.113
You know, those clouds are just
so beautiful.

18:31.247 --> 18:33.115
I feel like...
Oh, you see that bird?

18:33.249 --> 18:34.666
He's just, like, dancing back
and forth.

18:34.784 --> 18:37.286
Oh, you know, I think something
bit me here.

18:37.420 --> 18:41.206
Okay, um,
I don't like holding hands, and

18:41.341 --> 18:46.044
I don't want to do it anymore.
It's just, I feel like we're

18:46.212 --> 18:48.380
those weird twins in
<i>The Shining,</i> and it's not my

18:48.514 --> 18:52.217
thing. Okay, that is the weirdest
intimacy issue I've ever heard of.

18:52.352 --> 18:53.936
It's a guy thing.
It's just not where our hands

18:54.053 --> 19:00.655
want to be. Well, do you like it when I
hold this? That's not a fair question.

19:00.775 --> 19:01.560
Well, you still have to
answer it.

19:01.728 --> 19:04.029
Yes, yes, I like that.
Well, then you're gonna have

19:04.147 --> 19:09.766
to hold this. Consider it the contact
contract. The contact contract?

19:09.886 --> 19:14.890
Mm-hmm.
So, are you willing to sign?

19:15.024 --> 19:17.859
Can we make it an oral
agreement?

19:17.977 --> 19:21.563
I'll think about it.
Okay. All right.

19:33.492 --> 19:36.494
What are you doing here?!
I saw everything!

19:36.662 --> 19:39.247
Oh, my God, Rafi, it was a
mistake.

19:39.382 --> 19:41.383
I-I did not mean...
This is like a dream come

19:41.500 --> 19:43.501
true for me. Are you kidding?
What?

19:43.636 --> 19:45.556
You marked Sofia today.
You know what that means?

19:45.588 --> 19:47.339
No.
That means she's yours.

19:47.473 --> 19:50.342
I'm about to have my best friend
marry my sister.

19:50.509 --> 19:52.844
You are completely misreading
the situation!

19:53.012 --> 19:54.896
I'm happily married to Jenny!
Who, the woman that cleans

19:55.014 --> 19:56.848
your house, that dumb brunette?
That's a housekeeper that

19:57.016 --> 19:58.567
comes once a week.
I married Jenny. Brown hair...

19:58.684 --> 20:01.102
The one I had sex with?
You what?!

20:01.237 --> 20:04.522
Oh, great. I'm sorry!
I didn't know the difference

20:04.657 --> 20:06.324
between your housekeeper and
your wife!

20:06.442 --> 20:07.742
Did you have sex with my
housekeeper?

20:07.860 --> 20:09.778
Of course I did!
She found me asleep in the

20:09.912 --> 20:11.830
crawlspace, hand stuff started
happening, I don't know.

20:11.948 --> 20:13.915
You had hand sex with my
housekeeper?

20:14.033 --> 20:16.353
No, it started with hand sex,
and then it turned into mouth

20:16.369 --> 20:19.704
sex, pussy sex, butt sex.
We went top to bottom. T to B.

20:19.839 --> 20:22.591
Okay, you know what, Rafi?
I don't want anything to do

20:22.708 --> 20:25.093
with Sofia on that level.
Listen-- have you had one of

20:25.211 --> 20:26.928
her blow jobs yet?
No. No!

20:27.046 --> 20:28.763
They're amazing.
What?

20:28.881 --> 20:30.181
I've heard.
Okay, all right.

20:30.299 --> 20:31.516
A buddy told me.

20:31.634 --> 20:33.635
Please... Uh, occupied.
Over-occupied.

20:33.769 --> 20:35.849
There's a sign here that
specifically reads "only one

20:35.888 --> 20:37.639
person per fitting room."
I see four feet.

20:37.773 --> 20:39.107
That's too many feet.
Sorry, we're just jerking off

20:39.225 --> 20:40.308
in here.
We'll be out in a minute.

20:40.443 --> 20:41.893
No, we're not!
I'm sorry, we're not J-ing off.

20:42.061 --> 20:43.395
You want to get in on this, bro?

20:43.562 --> 20:46.398
No. Was the offer to get in on
it legitimate? No, it was not.

20:46.532 --> 20:48.199
No, it was not legitimate.
Time to go.

20:48.317 --> 20:50.285
Uh, we'll be out in a
second, sir.

20:50.403 --> 20:52.570
We are never coming out!
We're not going anywhere!

20:52.738 --> 20:56.458
You will have to get the FBI.
Gattaca!

20:56.575 --> 20:58.376
We got, like, five minutes to
get out of here.

20:58.377 --> 20:59.494
Leave me alone.
I'm a happily married man.

20:59.578 --> 21:01.746
There's no way you're happy!
You have two kids!

21:01.881 --> 21:04.466
Your wife is a disaster!
I'm going to take matters into

21:04.583 --> 21:06.918
my own hands!
I will show her this.

21:07.086 --> 21:10.839
She will divorce you. You will become
my brother forever. No, give me!

21:10.973 --> 21:12.841
What are you doing?
Give the...

21:12.975 --> 21:16.928
Isn't this nice? See, there's nothing
wrong with holding hands. No!

21:17.063 --> 21:18.930
Yeah, what could go wrong?

21:19.065 --> 21:21.266
Ooh.

21:21.434 --> 21:23.818
Sorry, Rosette!
Should've had your hand free.

21:23.936 --> 21:27.489
What happened?
Oh.

21:27.606 --> 21:29.691
No, no, no, no, no!

21:29.825 --> 21:32.110
Get it!
Come on.

21:32.244 --> 21:35.280
No! Sorry, I didn't mean it like that.
It's just, it's, you know.

21:35.414 --> 21:36.781
Come on.
No, don't.

21:36.916 --> 21:38.500
What are you... What?
No!

21:38.617 --> 21:41.002
No, Brian, no!
Why did you do that?!

21:41.120 --> 21:44.289
That's it.

21:44.423 --> 21:46.791
Time to go.
Oh.

21:46.926 --> 21:48.677
Huh?
I called the police.

21:48.794 --> 21:50.295
This isn't them.
This is William.

21:50.463 --> 21:52.343
He works across the street at
the 98 Cent Store.

21:52.465 --> 21:57.469
Get them, William.
Kevin, where are you?

21:57.636 --> 22:03.141
Happy sex-iversary.

22:03.309 --> 22:09.614
Come on, guys, I'm late to
meet my wife. Yeah, she can wait.

22:09.732 --> 22:11.973
You make me sick, you know?
We're not that kind of store.

22:12.068 --> 22:14.152
I mean, we were six months ago,
and that's exactly the kind of

22:14.320 --> 22:16.488
behavior that got us in trouble.
You disgust me.

22:16.655 --> 22:19.242
What?
What is this, your number?

22:19.362 --> 22:23.199
No. Look, I'm just a regular guy who
came in his pants, you know? It happens.

22:23.366 --> 22:25.201
All right, that's it.
Come on, get in the car.

22:25.368 --> 22:26.605
What? Oh, come on, man.
Watch your head, you pervert.

22:26.725 --> 22:29.371
Nice to meet you, Brian.
What?

22:29.539 --> 22:32.174
Hey, buddy.
Oh, no, no, no. No.

22:32.292 --> 22:34.176
What's going on?
I don't want to go to prison.

22:34.294 --> 22:36.512
Ooh, I hope we're cellmates.
That means we're prison married.

22:36.630 --> 22:37.991
We could take turns being the
girl.

22:40.121 --> 22:41.343
I'm not tender.

22:43.958 --> 22:46.159
Ready?
And take off your blindfold.

22:46.293 --> 22:48.411
Ta-da!
It's a hot tub.

22:48.546 --> 22:52.382
It's an aboveground hot tub.
It's just like <i> The Bachelor.</i>

22:52.500 --> 22:54.717
Come on, this is fun.
It's adventurous, right?

22:54.835 --> 22:58.888
Is this your hot tub? No, I just
kind of broke in here. We broke in?

22:59.006 --> 23:00.890
Yeah. You know, yeah.
This is, you know.

23:01.008 --> 23:02.892
Can we steal stuff?
Well, I actually know the

23:03.010 --> 23:04.928
people who live here, so I don't
want...

23:05.062 --> 23:07.430
You can steal stuff.
Whatever you want.

23:07.598 --> 23:10.600
I have a spare key. This is gonna be a
pretty adventurous date, right? Yeah.

23:10.734 --> 23:12.268
Come on, let's get in,
all right?

23:12.436 --> 23:14.103
Okay.
This is fun, right?

23:14.271 --> 23:15.605
Yeah.
Adventurous.

23:15.739 --> 23:17.540
I love breaking in.
You're sure no one's here?

23:17.658 --> 23:20.026
No one.
Get in there. All right.

23:20.160 --> 23:22.195
Love the moist pee bibs.

23:22.329 --> 23:26.499
All right.

23:26.617 --> 23:29.035
What? There are only, like, 20
or 30 pee bibs in there.

23:29.169 --> 23:32.755
Come on.
Come on, flush, flush.

23:32.873 --> 23:38.795
Ah, there she goes.

23:38.929 --> 23:42.131
Oh, boy.
That didn't sound good.

23:42.299 --> 23:44.183
Oh.

23:44.301 --> 23:46.603
Is it supposed to do that?
Don't you worry.

23:46.720 --> 23:50.857
I will fix this.

23:50.975 --> 23:55.812
Huh.
Huh.

23:55.980 --> 23:59.899
Huh.
Huh.

24:05.122 --> 24:09.125
These people live like animals.

24:09.243 --> 24:12.045
Oh, my God, this hot tub...
Oh, my God!
