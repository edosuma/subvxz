WEBVTT

00:13.840 --> 00:15.831
>> JESUS.

00:15.840 --> 00:17.603
>> WAS THIS A SHARK ATI'ACK?

00:17.610 --> 00:20.477
> > UTERINE CANCER.

00:20.480 --> 00:21.640
>> I'M NOT SURE WE UNDERSTAND,

00:21.650 --> 00:22.480
GLENN.

00:22.490 --> 00:24.845
>> 2 DAYS AGO, A MAN CAME IN TO

00:24.850 --> 00:26.351
RETRIEVE HIS DECEASED WIFE'S

00:26.360 --> 00:28.089
WEDDING RING. NORMALLY,

00:28.090 --> 00:29.159
POSSESSIONS ARE RETURNED BEFORE

00:29.160 --> 00:30.320
CREMATION, AND HIS WIFE'S

00:30.330 --> 00:31.354
REMAINS HAD BEEN SCHEDULED

00:31.360 --> 00:33.157
A WEEK AGO. BUT SINCE HE NEVER

00:33.160 --> 00:35.355
RECEIVED THE RING, WE CHECKED

00:35.360 --> 00:36.759
DOWN HERE TO SEE IF IT HAD

00:36.770 --> 00:39.193
ACCIDENTALLY BEEN LEFT BEHIND.

00:47.110 --> 00:50.602
THANK YOU. OUR CREMATORIUM

00:50.610 --> 00:54.512
OPERATOR, SILAS PRINE, MADE THIS

00:54.520 --> 00:56.841
UNUSED STORAGE ROOM HIS OWN

00:56.850 --> 00:58.488
PRIVATE HIDEAWAY.

00:58.490 --> 01:00.185
WE DISCOVERED 4 BODIES, ALL

01:00.190 --> 01:02.124
YOUNG WOMEN IN THEIR TWENTIES TO

01:02.130 --> 01:04.621
THIRTIES, EACH ONE MISSING A

01:04.630 --> 01:07.190
LIMB, EACH ONE SCHEDULED FOR

01:07.200 --> 01:09.521
CREMATION WEEKS OR EVEN MONTHS

01:09.530 --> 01:11.521
AGO. AND THEN [SIGHS] WE FOUND

01:11.530 --> 01:17.059
THIS.

01:24.610 --> 01:26.771
>> SO THE APPENDAGES ARE FROM

01:26.780 --> 01:28.145
DIFFERENT BODIES?

01:28.150 --> 01:28.775
>> IT LOOKS AS IF YOUR

01:28.780 --> 01:30.441
CREMATORIUM OPERATOR HAS BEEN

01:30.450 --> 01:32.418
EMBALMING HER FOR PRESERVATION,

01:32.420 --> 01:33.682
LIKE THEY DO WITH CADAVERS FOR

01:33.690 --> 01:34.611
ANATOMICAL STUDY.

01:34.620 --> 01:35.655
>> THAT'S CORRECT. WE'RE JUST

01:35.660 --> 01:37.685
NOT SURE WHERE HE LEARNED TO DO

01:37.690 --> 01:39.851
IT. EMBALMING IS THE MORTICIAN'S

01:39.860 --> 01:40.849
JOB, NOT THE CREMATORIUM

01:40.860 --> 01:41.792
OPERATOR.

01:41.800 --> 01:43.665
>> SOUNDS LIKE A LONELY JOB.

01:43.670 --> 01:46.230
>> PRINE IS THE QUIET KIND.

01:46.240 --> 01:48.162
WE ACTUALLY DON'T KNOW MUCH

01:48.170 --> 01:49.762
ABOUT HIM. HE'S A LONER. NO

01:49.770 --> 01:51.306
FAMILY, NO RELATIVES WE COULD

01:51.310 --> 01:51.901
FIND.

01:51.910 --> 01:53.434
>> SPEAKING OF FAMILY, I ASSUME

01:53.440 --> 01:54.532
THOSE OF THE DECEASED--

01:54.540 --> 01:55.768
>> THEY'VE ALL BEEN NOTIFIED

01:55.780 --> 01:56.804
AND HAVE AGREED TO KEEP IT QUIET

01:56.810 --> 01:58.175
FOR A SUBSTANTIAL SE'I'I'LEMENT

01:58.180 --> 02:00.569
WHILE WE RECTIFY THE SITUATION,

02:00.580 --> 02:06.189
WHICH IS WHERE YOU COME IN.

02:06.190 --> 02:07.589
>> I DON'T UNDERSTAND. AREN'T

02:07.590 --> 02:08.716
THEY ALL GONNA BE CREMATED

02:08.720 --> 02:09.721
ANYWAY?

02:09.730 --> 02:11.459
>> WE'D BE WORKING WITH NECROTIC

02:11.460 --> 02:12.449
TISSUE, WHICH WOULD MAKE

02:12.460 --> 02:13.757
RECONSTRUCTION VERY, VERY

02:13.760 --> 02:14.658
DIFFICULT.

02:14.660 --> 02:15.558
>> ONLY WHEN THESE BODIES ARE

02:15.560 --> 02:16.663
WHOLE CAN THESE WOMEN FINALLY

02:16.670 --> 02:18.319
REST IN PEACE.

02:18.330 --> 02:19.467
>> WE JUST DON'T DO THIS TYPE OF

02:19.470 --> 02:20.266
WORK.

02:20.270 --> 02:21.931
>> IT'S HIGHLY UNUSUAL, I KNOW,

02:21.940 --> 02:24.932
BUT I AM WILLING TO PAY WHATEVER

02:24.940 --> 02:27.875
YOU NEED.

02:27.880 --> 02:29.472
>> WE'VE HAD SOME BAD PRESS

02:29.480 --> 02:31.368
LATELY. WE'RE TRYING TO CLEAN UP

02:31.380 --> 02:32.210
OUR IMAGE.

02:32.220 --> 02:33.471
>> I FULLY INTEND ON KEEPING

02:33.480 --> 02:35.641
THIS QUIET. IF THE MEDIA EVER

02:35.650 --> 02:36.810
CAUGHT WIND OF WHAT HAPPENED,

02:36.820 --> 02:38.481
EASLEY MORTUARIES WOULD NEVER

02:38.490 --> 02:39.809
RECOVER.

02:42.360 --> 02:44.419
>> NOBODY NEEDS TO KNOW.

02:44.430 --> 02:45.783
WE CAN COME BACK AFTER OUR

02:45.790 --> 02:47.496
SCHEDULED SURGERY TODAY,

02:47.500 --> 02:49.297
AND IT SHOULD TAKE 3-4 HOURS

02:49.300 --> 02:50.619
TOPS.

02:50.630 --> 02:52.666
>> ACTUALLY, THERE IS ONE MORE

02:52.670 --> 02:54.592
PROBLEM THAT MAY CAUSE THIS TO

02:54.600 --> 02:57.728
TAKE SOME TIME.

02:57.740 --> 02:58.764
WE CAN'T LOCATE ONE OF THE

02:58.770 --> 02:59.998
BODIES.

03:00.010 --> 03:01.807
>> ONE OF THE ARMS OR LEGS

03:01.810 --> 03:05.371
DOESN'T HAVE AN OWNER?

03:05.380 --> 03:07.519
>> THE HEAD.

03:07.520 --> 03:09.385
WE DON'T KNOW WHERE THE HEAD

03:09.390 --> 03:12.382
CAME FROM OR WHO IT BELONGS TO.

03:12.390 --> 03:15.712
AND PRINE ISN'T TALKING.

04:05.740 --> 04:07.071
>> COUNT BACK FROM 10 FOR ME,

04:07.080 --> 04:08.809
MRS. HANSEN-TAGEN.

04:08.810 --> 04:11.472
> > [SPEAKING GERMAN]

04:11.480 --> 04:14.347
>> HUH? UM...

04:14.350 --> 04:17.478
EINS, ZWEI...

04:17.490 --> 04:20.482
EINS, ZWEI...

04:20.490 --> 04:23.618
FORGET IT.

04:23.630 --> 04:25.450
THE NEXT TIME WE GET A GERMAN

04:25.460 --> 04:27.519
TOURIST AS A PATIENT, WE MIGHT

04:27.530 --> 04:29.327
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE

04:29.330 --> 04:30.524
ABLE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY'RE

04:30.530 --> 04:33.067
SAYING BEFORE WE DO ANY INVASIVE

04:33.070 --> 04:33.889
PROCEDURES.

04:33.900 --> 04:35.868
>> NECK LIPO IS NECK LIPO, LIZ,

04:35.870 --> 04:38.668
NO MATTER HOW YOU SAY IT.

04:38.670 --> 04:40.376
ACTUALLY, I TAKE THAT BACK.

04:40.380 --> 04:41.779
IN MRS. HANSEN-TAGEN'S CASE,

04:41.780 --> 04:42.872
IT'S A REPRIEVE FROM BEING

04:42.880 --> 04:44.973
CONFUSED WITH A BASSET HOUND.

04:44.980 --> 04:46.106
AND NOW THAT OUR WEBSITE'S BEEN

04:46.110 --> 04:47.418
SHUT DOWN, I DOUBT WE'LL HAVE

04:47.420 --> 04:48.375
ANY MORE INTERNATIONAL

04:48.380 --> 04:52.589
CUSTOMERS ANYTIME SOON.

04:52.590 --> 04:54.012
>> I CONSIDER IT A BLESSING THAT

04:54.020 --> 04:55.419
MRS. HANSEN-TAGEN DOESN'T KNOW

04:55.420 --> 04:56.682
ENGLISH, ACTUALLY.

04:56.690 --> 04:58.055
SHE'S THE LAST PATIENT ON OUR

04:58.060 --> 04:59.789
BOOKS--THE ONLY ONE WHO HASN'T

04:59.800 --> 05:00.949
CANCELED BECAUSE OF THE CARVER

05:00.960 --> 05:01.949
ACCUSATIONS.

05:01.960 --> 05:02.927
>> THAT'S NOT TRUE, SEAN. YOU

05:02.930 --> 05:03.862
SAID NO TO THE JOB AT THE

05:03.870 --> 05:05.826
MORTUARY. THE MONEY HE OFFERED

05:05.830 --> 05:06.694
WOULD HAVE GO'I'I'EN US THROUGH

05:06.700 --> 05:08.133
THIS DRY SPELL. RIGHT NOW,

05:08.140 --> 05:09.437
WE HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO TAKE

05:09.440 --> 05:10.566
WHATEVER COMES OUR WAY.

05:10.570 --> 05:12.572
>> YES, WE DO. ESPECIALLY WHEN

05:12.580 --> 05:13.831
THE JOB WILL HURT OUR REPUTATION

05:13.840 --> 05:16.035
FURTHER. AND RECONSTRUCTING DEAD

05:16.040 --> 05:17.541
BODIES FOR CREMATION WON'T

05:17.550 --> 05:18.699
LEAD TO THE SORT OF CLIENTELE

05:18.710 --> 05:20.712
I'M INTERESTED IN HAVING.

05:20.720 --> 05:22.449
>> WE NEED TO MAKE MONEY, SEAN.

05:22.450 --> 05:23.587
I CAN'T AFFORD TO DO THIS

05:23.590 --> 05:25.114
ANYMORE. MY NEST EGG HAS BEEN

05:25.120 --> 05:26.985
CRACKED AND SCRAMBLED.

05:26.990 --> 05:28.389
>> WE'LL GET THROUGH THIS,

05:28.390 --> 05:29.857
CHRISTIAN. WE ALWAYS HAVE

05:29.860 --> 05:30.724
BEFORE.

05:30.730 --> 05:31.719
>> AND I KNOW THAT AFTER YOUR

05:31.730 --> 05:33.095
DIVORCE AND BUYING JULIA'S HALF

05:33.100 --> 05:34.089
OF THE HOUSE, YOU'RE NOT EXACTLY

05:34.100 --> 05:35.829
ROLLING IN IT.

05:35.830 --> 05:38.492
>> NO, I CAN'T SAY THAT I AM.

05:38.500 --> 05:42.129
>> SO, WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

05:42.140 --> 05:43.129
IF SOMETHING DOESN'T COME OUR

05:43.140 --> 05:44.835
WAY SOON, THEN YOUR HIGH

05:44.840 --> 05:46.432
STANDARDS ARE GONNA SEND US ALL

05:46.440 --> 05:49.978
ON LONG VACATIONS.

05:49.980 --> 05:50.969
>> WE'RE JUST GONNA HAVE TO MAKE

05:50.980 --> 05:51.947
SOME TOUGH DECISIONS, THAT'S

05:51.950 --> 05:53.076
ALL.

06:00.190 --> 06:02.010
>> SO IT'S BEEN REALLY BAD AT

06:02.020 --> 06:02.725
WORK, HUH?

06:02.730 --> 06:04.186
>> I THINK SEAN BLAMES ME FOR

06:04.190 --> 06:05.919
THE DROP IN BUSINESS.

06:05.930 --> 06:07.454
WOULD YOU WANT TO BE OPERATED ON

06:07.460 --> 06:08.154
BY THE GUY WHO WAS ACCUSED OF

06:08.160 --> 06:09.798
BEING THE CARVER?

06:09.800 --> 06:11.529
>> WELL, I MIGHT LET YOU GIVE ME

06:11.530 --> 06:12.667
SOME NEW TITS IF IT'LL HELP WITH

06:12.670 --> 06:16.504
ADVERTISING. THOUGH YOU DID SAVE

06:16.510 --> 06:17.499
MY LIFE WHEN I SHOWED UP SICK

06:17.510 --> 06:19.034
AND DYING.

06:19.040 --> 06:20.029
>> YOU LOOK LIKE YOU'RE DOING

06:20.040 --> 06:21.132
OK, GINA.

06:21.140 --> 06:22.778
>> YEAH. YOU KNOW, I'M OK.

06:22.780 --> 06:26.546
MY VIRAL LOAD IS DOWN. MY T-CELL

06:26.550 --> 06:27.949
COUNT'S BEEN REALLY HIGH.

06:27.950 --> 06:30.544
I'VE BEEN GOING TO THE GYM,

06:30.550 --> 06:33.986
EATING WELL. I'VE EVEN HAD TIME

06:33.990 --> 06:35.787
TO TAKE A REAL ESTATE CLASS DOWN

06:35.790 --> 06:38.884
AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE.

06:38.890 --> 06:40.949
>> THAT'LL MAKE THIS A LITTLE

06:40.960 --> 06:43.861
EASIER THEN. I CAN'T PAY FOR

06:43.870 --> 06:44.928
YOUR RENT OR YOUR CAR LEASE

06:44.930 --> 06:46.591
ANYMORE.

06:46.600 --> 06:47.999
>> THAT'S NOT FUNNY, ASSHOLE.

06:48.000 --> 06:48.932
>> I'LL STILL PAY FOR YOUR

06:48.940 --> 06:50.134
PRESCRIPTIONS, BUT AFTER THIS

06:50.140 --> 06:51.539
MONTH, YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN FOR

06:51.540 --> 06:53.701
THE REST.

06:53.710 --> 06:55.075
I'M SORRY. I WISH I COULD

06:55.080 --> 06:56.775
CONTINUE TO HELP, BUT--

06:56.780 --> 06:59.146
>> YOU ASSHOLE. GOD, I SHOULD

06:59.150 --> 07:00.117
HAVE KNOWN I COULDN'T COUNT ON

07:00.120 --> 07:02.486
YOU. YOU ARE A WORTHLESS SACK OF

07:02.490 --> 07:03.218
SHIT!

07:03.220 --> 07:04.812
>> FOR GOD SAKES, KEEP YOUR

07:04.820 --> 07:06.981
VOICE DOWN. WHY ARE YOU BEING SO

07:06.990 --> 07:07.752
HOSTILE?

07:07.760 --> 07:08.749
>> BECAUSE I WAS GONNA ASK YOU

07:08.760 --> 07:11.228
FOR A LOAN TODAY.

07:11.230 --> 07:12.595
>> SO YOU'RE ADMITTING THAT YOU

07:12.600 --> 07:13.897
IRRESPONSIBLY BLEW THROUGH ALL

07:13.900 --> 07:14.821
OF THE MONEY THAT I'VE BEEN

07:14.830 --> 07:17.094
GIVING YOU. NICE.

07:17.100 --> 07:18.089
>> I DIDN'T BLOW THROUGH THE

07:18.100 --> 07:19.692
MONEY, ASSHOLE. I'VE BEEN SAVING

07:19.700 --> 07:21.565
THE LEFTOVER PITTANCE, BUT IT

07:21.570 --> 07:22.559
ISN'T ENOUGH TO MAKE THE

07:22.570 --> 07:23.502
INVESTMENT I WANT TO MAKE.

07:23.510 --> 07:24.807
THAT'S WHY I NEED A GODDAMN

07:24.810 --> 07:26.505
LOAN. YOU KNOW, I'M FINALLY

07:26.510 --> 07:27.204
ABOUT TO DO SOMETHING WITH MY

07:27.210 --> 07:28.734
LIFE, AND YOU HAVE TO PULL THE

07:28.740 --> 07:29.638
RUG OUT FROM UNDER ME!

07:29.650 --> 07:30.639
>> THIS WASN'T ALIMONY, YOU

07:30.650 --> 07:31.674
UNGRATEFUL BITCH. YOU SHOULD

07:31.680 --> 07:32.578
HAVE BEEN THANKING ME FOR THE

07:32.580 --> 07:33.615
MONEY I DID GIVE YOU!

07:33.620 --> 07:34.541
>> I HOPE YOUR BUSINESS GOES IN

07:34.550 --> 07:35.676
THE SHI'I'TER AND YOU HAVE TO COME

07:35.680 --> 07:37.511
CRAWLING TO ME FOR A JOB.

07:45.060 --> 07:46.186
[APPLAUSE]

07:46.190 --> 07:47.953
>> I'M SURE WE ALL CAN BENEFIT

07:47.960 --> 07:49.154
FROM THE NEW AEROBIC STRETCHES.

07:49.160 --> 07:51.219
THANK YOU, MR. DAVIES OF EAST

07:51.230 --> 07:54.063
BAY GYM. WELL, NEXT IN OUR

07:54.070 --> 07:54.934
WEDNESDAY LECTURE SERIES ON

07:54.940 --> 07:56.191
HEALTH AND BEAUTY, PLEASE

07:56.200 --> 07:58.304
WELCOME DR. SEAN MCNAMARA, WHO'S

07:58.310 --> 08:00.039
COME TODAY TO TALK ABOUT THE

08:00.040 --> 08:00.972
NEW, EXCITING DEVELOPMENTS

08:00.980 --> 08:02.743
IN PLASTIC SURGERY.

08:02.750 --> 08:05.947
[APPLAUSE]

08:05.950 --> 08:08.874
>> THANK YOU. AS NURSE STEVENS

08:08.880 --> 08:12.008
SAID, I'M DR. SEAN MCNAMARA AND

08:12.020 --> 08:16.628
I'M A PLASTIC SURGEON. UM...

08:16.630 --> 08:17.927
IS THERE ANYONE HERE WHO'S HAD

08:17.930 --> 08:20.592
A RECONSTRUCT IVE PROCEDURE?

08:20.600 --> 08:21.851
YES, MA'AM. WHAT HAVE YOU HAD

08:21.860 --> 08:22.861
DONE?

08:22.870 --> 08:26.590
>> I HAD A HIP REPLACED.

08:26.600 --> 08:29.763
>> I SEE. WELL, THAT'S A LITTLE

08:29.770 --> 08:31.761
DIFFERENT. A HIP REPLACEMENT IS

08:31.770 --> 08:33.977
DONE BY AN ORTHOPEDIC SURGEON.

08:38.180 --> 08:40.774
LET ME PUT IT TO YOU A DIFFERENT

08:40.780 --> 08:43.248
WAY. HAVE YOU EVER LOOKED IN THE

08:43.250 --> 08:45.741
MIRROR AND THOUGHT, "THOSE

08:45.750 --> 08:47.115
CROW'S FEET AROUND MY EYES

08:47.120 --> 08:49.054
REALLY BOTHER ME" OR "IF I COULD

08:49.060 --> 08:50.857
JUST GET RID OF THAT TIRE AROUND

08:50.860 --> 08:52.919
MY MIDSECTION, I'D FEEL 10 YEARS

08:52.930 --> 08:56.798
YOUNGER"? WELL, IF YOU HAVE,

08:56.800 --> 09:00.930
UH...IF...

09:00.940 --> 09:03.363
UM...

09:03.370 --> 09:05.668
UH...

09:05.670 --> 09:08.173
IF YOU HAVE, PLASTIC SURGERY

09:08.180 --> 09:11.149

A SPIRIT OR WHATEVER THAT IS,

23:39.510 --> 23:43.014
IT'S NOT HERE. THEY'RE GONE.

23:43.020 --> 23:44.487

AND THEY DIED TOO YOUNG, AND

23:47.790 --> 23:48.984
THEY DESERVE RESPECT AND

23:48.990 --> 23:52.881
DIGNITY.

29:09.210 --> 29:10.905

29:12.280 --> 29:13.201
BUT, YOU KNOW, THE FACT IS THAT,

29:13.210 --> 29:15.474
UM, I'LL BE FREE IN ABOUT 5 OR

29:15.480 --> 29:18.449
10 YEARS. I'M NOT--I DIDN'T

29:18.450 --> 29:22.557
KILL ANYBODY AND I'M ONLY 38,

29:22.560 --> 29:23.549
SO I'VE GOT A LOT OF LIFE AHEAD

SHE'S VERY SPECIAL TO ME...

29:49.280 --> 29:51.282
AND I WANT TO BE WITH HER

29:51.290 --> 29:53.986
WHEN I'M RELEASED.

29:53.990 --> 29:56.515
SHE, UM...

29:56.520 --> 30:00.024
SHE WANTED TO BE CREMATED.

30:00.030 --> 30:01.327
I JUST CAN'T LET THAT HAPPEN.

30:01.330 --> 30:02.354
I MEAN, IT'S JUST AN AWFUL THING

30:02.360 --> 30:05.295
TO DO TO PEOPLE, CREMATE THEM.

30:05.300 --> 30:07.461
I MEAN, I SHOULD KNOW. I'VE SEEN

30:07.470 --> 30:08.994
HALF-MELTED BODIES THAT NEED TO

30:09.000 --> 30:10.262
BE REPOSITIONED IN ORDER TO

30:10.270 --> 30:12.238
FULLY BURN, THEIR SKIN SCORCHED

30:12.240 --> 30:15.073
OFF, THEIR ABDOMENS DISTENDED

30:15.080 --> 30:17.036
LIKE BALLOONS.

30:17.040 --> 30:19.349
>> HER HEAD IS DECOMPOSING.

30:19.350 --> 30:21.318
IN 5 TO 10 YEARS, IT'LL BE

30:21.320 --> 30:22.617
NOTHING BUT A BRITTLE SKULL.

30:22.620 --> 30:23.644
>> HAVEN'T YOU HEARD OF

30:23.650 --> 30:24.617
CRYONICS?

30:24.620 --> 30:27.088
>> IT'S TOO LATE FOR HER.

30:27.090 --> 30:28.580
CRYONICS REQUIRES THAT THE BODY

30:28.590 --> 30:30.285
BE FROZEN RIGHT AFTER DEATH.

30:30.290 --> 30:31.518
SCIENCE CAN'T SAVE HER.

30:31.530 --> 30:33.122
>> YEAH? WHAT IF YOU'RE WRONG?

30:33.130 --> 30:35.553
WHAT IF MEDICINE DOES ADVANCE

30:35.560 --> 30:36.891
TO THE EXTENT THAT SHE COULD BE

30:36.900 --> 30:37.594
RETURNED TO ME? I MEAN, WHAT

30:37.600 --> 30:39.420
HAVE I GOT TO LOSE?

30:48.340 --> 30:51.275
[SIGHS]

30:51.280 --> 30:56.513
I LOVE HER.

30:56.520 --> 31:00.217
SHE IS ALL I HAVE...

31:00.220 --> 31:02.552
AND I WILL DO EVERYTHING

31:02.560 --> 31:07.350
POSSIBLE TO TRY TO SAVE HER.

31:07.360 --> 31:10.090
AND--AND...

31:10.100 --> 31:13.558
WHO ARE YOU TO TRY AND STOP ME?

31:13.570 --> 31:15.629
I MEAN, REALLY, DR. MCNAMARA?

31:15.640 --> 31:17.164
ISN'T WHAT YOU DO PRETTY MUCH

31:17.170 --> 31:19.035
THE SAME THING? I MEAN, ISN'T

31:19.040 --> 31:20.564
PLASTIC SURGERY JUST GIVING

31:20.570 --> 31:22.128
PEOPLE THE OPPORTUNITY TO

31:22.140 --> 31:23.334
PUT OFF THEIR DECAY?

31:23.340 --> 31:24.568
>> I THINK WHAT I DO IS MAKE

31:24.580 --> 31:25.604
PEOPLE FEEL BETTER ABOUT

31:25.610 --> 31:30.115
THEMSELVES.

31:30.120 --> 31:34.011
>> OK. THEN JUST THINK OF HER

31:34.020 --> 31:36.659
AS ANOTHER PATIENT.

31:36.660 --> 31:38.719
SHE WANTS TO FEEL BETTER ABOUT

31:38.730 --> 31:41.198
HERSELF, TOO...

31:41.200 --> 31:43.122
BY LIVING AGAIN.

31:50.300 --> 31:53.667
>> IF I AGREE TO DO THIS,

31:53.670 --> 31:57.606
WILL YOU TELL ME WHO SHE IS?

31:57.610 --> 32:01.273
>> [SIGHS]

32:03.320 --> 32:05.345
OF COURSE.

32:09.690 --> 32:11.419
[SIGHS]

32:20.370 --> 32:25.330
HER NAME IS LAURA...

32:25.340 --> 32:28.070
AND SHE'S MY SISTER.

32:32.650 --> 32:35.676
>> YEAH. RIGHT. I'LL SEE YOU

32:35.680 --> 32:36.647
LATER.

32:41.160 --> 32:44.254
I NEED TO SPEAK WITH YOU, GINA.

32:44.260 --> 32:46.319
>> I'LL SEE YOU LATER, CARLITO.

32:46.330 --> 32:49.527
>> [SIGHS]

32:49.530 --> 32:51.293
I KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON, GINA.

32:51.300 --> 32:53.097
THIS IS A BUSINESS, AND

32:53.100 --> 32:54.738
BARTERING WITH SEXUAL FAVORS

32:54.740 --> 32:56.628
IS UNPROFESSIONAL, ILLEGAL,

32:56.640 --> 32:58.733
AND WITH YOUR HIV, EXTREMELY

32:58.740 --> 32:59.638
DANGEROUS.

32:59.640 --> 33:00.664
>> I HAVE NOT ENDANGERED

33:00.670 --> 33:02.206
ANYONE'S LIFE, I HAVEN'T SLEPT

33:02.210 --> 33:03.279
WITH ANYONE, AND I'VE BEEN VERY

33:03.280 --> 33:04.349
CAREFUL TO PROTECT MYSELF.

33:04.350 --> 33:05.772
>> IT'S STILL NOT A WAY TO RUN

33:05.780 --> 33:08.374
A COMPANY! I HAVE WORKED TOO

33:08.380 --> 33:10.314
HARD TO BE UNDERMINED LIKE THIS.

33:10.320 --> 33:11.241
>> JULIA, I DIDN'T TELL YOU

33:11.250 --> 33:12.182
ABOUT THIS BECAUSE I--

33:12.190 --> 33:13.179
>> YOU DIDN'T TELL ME ABOUT THIS

33:13.190 --> 33:14.179
BECAUSE YOU KNEW I WOULDN'T

33:14.190 --> 33:14.713
AGREE WITH IT!

33:14.720 --> 33:15.618
>> OH, BUT YOU AGREE WITH THE

33:15.620 --> 33:17.554
MONEY I'VE BEEN SAVING, RIGHT?

33:17.560 --> 33:19.289
WHEN PEOPLE GIVE YOU DISCOUNTS,

33:19.290 --> 33:20.450
THEY EXPECT SOMETHING IN RETURN.

33:20.460 --> 33:22.098
>> YOU'RE STILL NOT GETTING IT,

33:22.100 --> 33:24.568
GINA. IT IS DIFFICULT ENOUGH

33:24.570 --> 33:25.366
BEING A WOMAN IN THE

33:25.370 --> 33:26.462
PROFESSIONAL WORLD. WHAT YOU'RE

33:26.470 --> 33:28.097
DOING MAKES IT EVEN HARDER.

33:28.100 --> 33:29.135
IT CHEAPENS US.

33:29.140 --> 33:30.289
>> YOU TOLD ME THAT I WAS GOOD

33:30.300 --> 33:31.232
AT CONVINCING PEOPLE TO DO

33:31.240 --> 33:33.128
THINGS. THAT'S WHAT I'M DOING!

33:33.140 --> 33:34.505
>> BUT YOU'RE BETTER THAN THIS,

33:34.510 --> 33:37.377
GINA. NOW, I WANTED YOU AS A

33:37.380 --> 33:38.278
PARTNER BECAUSE YOU'RE

33:38.280 --> 33:39.440
AMBITIOUS, BECAUSE YOU CAN

33:39.450 --> 33:41.111
STAND UP FOR YOURSELF, BECAUSE

33:41.120 --> 33:42.815
YOU'RE SMART! NOT BECAUSE YOU

33:42.820 --> 33:45.516
CAN GET A MAN TO SLEEP WITH YOU.

33:45.520 --> 33:48.409
NOW, LOOK. WE BOTH WANT TO DO

33:48.420 --> 33:50.581
WHAT IT TAKES TO BE SUCCESSFUL,

33:50.590 --> 33:52.080
AND I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE

33:52.090 --> 33:53.079
THAT WHEN WE GET THERE, THERE

33:53.090 --> 33:55.126
AREN'T ANY RAISED EYEBROWS.

33:55.130 --> 33:56.597
I DON'T WANT ANYONE TO BE ABLE

33:56.600 --> 33:59.160
TO SAY THAT WE DON'T DESERVE IT.

34:04.140 --> 34:05.505
OH!

34:05.510 --> 34:06.602
>> I'LL GO SEE HOW THE

34:06.610 --> 34:08.168
ELECT RICIAN'S DOING.

34:15.880 --> 34:16.710
>> HI.

34:16.720 --> 34:17.744
>> HEY.

34:17.750 --> 34:18.819
>> A PACKAGE FOR YOU CAME TO THE

34:18.820 --> 34:20.117
HOUSE. I THOUGHT I'D BRING IT

34:20.120 --> 34:22.680
BY, SEE HOW IT'S GOING.

34:22.690 --> 34:24.351
LOOKS LIKE THINGS ARE MOVING

34:24.360 --> 34:25.657
FULL STEAM AHEAD.

34:25.660 --> 34:27.150
>> YEAH. WE'RE RIGHT ON

34:27.160 --> 34:29.151
SCHEDULE.

34:29.160 --> 34:31.469
>> I HAVE TO SAY, JULES,

34:31.470 --> 34:33.426
I'M IMPRESSED.

34:33.430 --> 34:34.397
YOU'RE REALLY MAKING THIS

34:34.400 --> 34:38.336
HAPPEN. CONGRATULATIONS.

34:38.340 --> 34:39.659
>> YEAH. WELL, THANKS FOR

34:39.670 --> 34:40.864
BRINGING THIS BY, BUT IF YOU

34:40.870 --> 34:42.508
DON'T MIND, I HAVE WORK TO DO.

34:42.510 --> 34:44.444
>> I WAS ACTUALLY HOPING WE

34:44.450 --> 34:48.614
COULD TALK.

34:48.620 --> 34:50.417
I WANTED TO APOLOGIZE FOR HOW WE

34:50.420 --> 34:53.719
TREATED YOU THE OTHER DAY.

34:53.720 --> 34:55.517
WE'VE REALLY TAKEN A HIT SINCE

34:55.520 --> 34:58.353
THESE CARVER ACCUSATIONS, AND

34:58.360 --> 35:00.351
AFTER THE DIVORCE SETTLEMENT,

35:00.360 --> 35:01.759
THERE JUST ISN'T ENOUGH MONEY

35:01.760 --> 35:04.228
TO INVEST IN YOUR SPA.

35:04.230 --> 35:04.889
I SHOULD HAVE TOLD YOU ABOUT

35:04.900 --> 35:08.495
MY SITUATION EARLIER, I KNOW.

35:08.500 --> 35:11.867
I HAVEN'T HANDLED THIS WELL.

35:11.870 --> 35:13.303
I JUST WANTED YOU TO KNOW I'M

35:13.310 --> 35:14.470
STILL ON YOUR SIDE.

35:14.480 --> 35:17.233
>> [LAUGHS] WELL, THAT'S FUNNY,

35:17.240 --> 35:18.673
BECAUSE YOU AND CHRISTIAN

35:18.680 --> 35:19.874
COULDN'T HAVE MADE IT MORE

35:19.880 --> 35:20.949
CLEAR THAT YOU DIDN'T BELIEVE

35:20.950 --> 35:24.249
IN ME.

35:24.250 --> 35:26.616
LOOK, THE TRUTH IS, SEAN,

35:26.620 --> 35:29.487
I AM TIRED OF DESTROYING AND

35:29.490 --> 35:31.526
RESUSCITATING OUR RELATIONSHIP

35:31.530 --> 35:34.226
OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

35:34.230 --> 35:35.822
I DON'T NEED YOU ON MY SIDE

35:35.830 --> 35:37.593
ANYMORE.

35:37.600 --> 35:39.192
ALL YOU ARE TO ME ANYMORE IS

35:39.200 --> 35:40.963
A PARENT TO MATT AND ANNIE.

35:40.970 --> 35:42.289
NOTHING ELSE.

36:11.570 --> 36:14.835
>> LIZ, WHERE YOU GOING? DIDN'T

36:14.840 --> 36:15.989
CHRISTIAN TELL YOU? WE TOOK THE

36:16.000 --> 36:17.558
JOB AT THE MORTUARY. WE DON'T

36:17.570 --> 36:18.639
HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT MONEY FOR AT

36:18.640 --> 36:19.629
LEAST 3 MONTHS.

36:19.640 --> 36:21.005
>> I DID TELL HER, SEAN.

36:21.010 --> 36:23.001
APPARENTLY, IT'S TOO LATE.

36:23.010 --> 36:24.807
>> I'M SORRY, SEAN, BUT I HAVE

36:24.810 --> 36:26.846
TAKEN ANOTHER JOB.

36:26.850 --> 36:29.739
>> WHERE?

36:29.750 --> 36:32.446
>> [SIGHS] JULIA'S SPA.

36:32.450 --> 36:33.644
>> WHY DO THEY NEED AN

36:33.650 --> 36:34.856
ANESTH ESIOLOGIST AT A RECOVERY

36:34.860 --> 36:35.986
SPA?

36:35.990 --> 36:36.979
>> I'M MORE THAN JUST AN

36:36.990 --> 36:39.379
ANESTHESIOLOGIST, SEAN. JULIA

36:39.390 --> 36:40.687
HIRED ME TO BE THEIR GENERAL

36:40.690 --> 36:41.691
PRACTITIONER.

36:41.700 --> 36:42.758
>> WHAT IF IT DOESN'T WORK OUT?

36:42.760 --> 36:43.692
WHAT IF THEY RUN OUT OF MONEY?

36:43.700 --> 36:44.689
YOU EXPECT US JUST TO TAKE YOU

36:44.700 --> 36:46.429
IN AGAIN?

36:46.430 --> 36:49.399
>> I BELIEVE IN JULIA, SEAN. SHE

36:49.400 --> 36:52.005
IS VERY SMART. I THINK DE LA MER

36:52.010 --> 36:53.602
HAS THE POTENTIAL TO REALLY HELP

36:53.610 --> 36:54.634
PEOPLE.

36:54.640 --> 36:55.732
>> YOU DON'T THINK WE'RE HELPING

36:55.740 --> 36:57.879
PEOPLE?

36:57.880 --> 37:01.338
>> I GUESS I AM JUST TIRED OF

37:01.350 --> 37:03.875
PUTTING THEM TO SLEEP.

37:18.970 --> 37:20.426
>> TELL ME WHAT YOU DON'T LIKE

37:20.430 --> 37:21.931
ABOUT YOURSELF, MRS. OGILVIE?

37:21.940 --> 37:24.363
>> WELL, AFTER SEEING DR.

37:24.370 --> 37:26.304
MCNAMARA'S PRESENTATION, I

37:26.310 --> 37:28.835
THOUGHT IT WOULD BE REALLY NICE

37:28.840 --> 37:31.445
TO REGAIN SOME OF THAT HOP IN MY

37:31.450 --> 37:33.077
STEP.

37:33.080 --> 37:34.047
>> AND WHAT EXACTLY DO YOU

37:34.050 --> 37:35.415
HAVE IN MIND?

37:35.420 --> 37:38.639
>> I THINK I WANT A FACE LIFT.

37:38.650 --> 37:40.743
>> GREAT. YOU'LL FEEL 25 YEARS

37:40.750 --> 37:41.717
YOUNGER.

37:41.720 --> 37:43.608
>> NOT 25. I DON'T WANT MY

37:43.620 --> 37:45.053
DAUGHTER THINKING I'M COMPETING

37:45.060 --> 37:48.029
WITH HER. HA HA HA.

37:48.030 --> 37:49.099
>> NEVER FEEL GUILTY FOR BEING

37:49.100 --> 37:50.590
BEAUTIFUL, MRS. OGILVIE.

37:50.600 --> 37:51.624
>> AWW.

37:51.630 --> 37:52.892
>> AND WHILE YOU'RE HERE, WHY

37:52.900 --> 37:54.367
DON'T WE WORK ON A FEW OTHER

37:54.370 --> 37:55.769
THINGS? PERHAPS REMOVE THE BAGS

37:55.770 --> 37:57.795
UNDER YOUR EYES, FLATTEN YOUR

37:57.800 --> 37:58.960
TUMMY A LITTLE?

37:58.970 --> 38:01.370
>> WELL, DR. MCNAMARA DID SAY

38:01.380 --> 38:02.870
THAT THE SECOND OPERATION WOULD

38:02.880 --> 38:03.938
BE HALF-PRICE.

38:03.940 --> 38:05.976
>> THAT'S RIGHT. SO, I THINK WE

38:05.980 --> 38:07.845
HAVE AN OPENING COMING UP--

38:07.850 --> 38:09.340
>> MRS. OGILVIE, LET'S TAKE A

38:09.350 --> 38:10.817
STEP BACK AND THINK CLEARLY FOR

38:10.820 --> 38:12.788
A MOMENT. FOR SOMEONE YOUR AGE,

38:12.790 --> 38:14.348
THE OPERATIONS CAN BE VERY

38:14.360 --> 38:15.713
DANGEROUS.

38:15.720 --> 38:16.618
>> BUT YOU SAID MORE SENIOR

38:16.620 --> 38:17.814
CITIZENS WERE HAVING PLASTIC

38:17.820 --> 38:18.752
SURGERY.

38:18.760 --> 38:19.988
>> YOU'RE RIGHT, I DID. AND I

38:19.990 --> 38:22.823
SHOULD NOT HAVE ENCOURAGED YOU.

38:22.830 --> 38:23.899
I'M AFRAID YOU'RE WASTING YOUR

38:23.900 --> 38:27.768
TIME. YOU'RE OLD, MRS. OGILVIE.

38:27.770 --> 38:29.067
YOUR SKIN HAS VERY LITTLE

38:29.070 --> 38:30.662
ELASTICITY. A FACE LIFT WILL

38:30.670 --> 38:31.602
PULL IT SO TIGHT, YOU'D HAVE

38:31.610 --> 38:33.009
DIFFICULTY SMILING, FROWNING,

38:33.010 --> 38:34.602
RAISING YOUR EYEBROWS. IT WOULD

38:34.610 --> 38:37.408
MASK THE REAL YOU.

38:37.410 --> 38:38.502
>> YOU'LL BE FINE. WE'LL TAKE

38:38.510 --> 38:39.647
VERY GOOD CARE OF YOU HERE, I

38:39.650 --> 38:41.868
PROMISE.

38:41.880 --> 38:44.713
>> WELL, I THINK I WANT THE

38:44.720 --> 38:47.917
OPERATIONS THIS FRIDAY.

38:47.920 --> 38:51.754
>> GREAT.

38:51.760 --> 38:54.797
>> 15 BLADE.

39:15.650 --> 39:18.346
> > SCISSORS.

39:23.790 --> 39:25.087
SHIT, IT'S RIPPING.

39:25.090 --> 39:26.079
>> IT'S ALL RIGHT. IT'LL BE

39:26.090 --> 39:26.988
EXCESS WHEN WE PULL THE DERMIS

39:26.990 --> 39:27.957
TIGHT.

39:27.960 --> 39:29.097
>> I'LL HAVE TO GO A LITTLE

39:29.100 --> 39:30.897
DEEPER.

39:38.570 --> 39:39.559
>> BE CAREFUL.

39:39.570 --> 39:40.639
>> I CAN'T GO ANY DEEPER. IT'S

39:40.640 --> 39:41.675
TOO DELICATE. I DON'T THINK THIS

39:41.680 --> 39:42.704
IS GONNA WORK.

39:42.710 --> 39:43.608
>> IF WE HAVE TO, WE CAN GRAB

39:43.610 --> 39:44.747
SOME SKIN FROM HER THIGH.

39:44.750 --> 39:45.876
>> HER ENTIRE FACE IS GONNA BE

39:45.880 --> 39:46.972
LIKE THIS. THE SKIN IS JUST TOO

39:46.980 --> 39:50.017
THIN. SHE'S TOO OLD.

40:07.470 --> 40:12.203
>> WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

40:12.210 --> 40:14.132
>> I'M SORRY, CHRISTIAN. I CAN'T

40:14.140 --> 40:16.131
DO THIS ANYMORE.

40:16.140 --> 40:17.573
>> IT'S ALL RIGHT. I'LL FINISH

40:17.580 --> 40:18.604
UP, AND WE CAN TALK ABOUT IT

40:18.610 --> 40:19.099
TOMORROW.

40:19.110 --> 40:20.008
>> THERE'S NOT GONNA BE A

40:20.010 --> 40:21.238
TOMORROW FOR US! QUENTIN IS AN

40:21.250 --> 40:22.877
EXCELLENT SURGEON. I'M SURE YOU

40:22.880 --> 40:24.142
TWO WILL GET ALONG JUST FINE.

40:24.150 --> 40:26.015
>> WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

40:26.020 --> 40:27.715
YOU CAN'T JUST QUIT. WE HAVE A

40:27.720 --> 40:28.789
GODDAMN PATIENT ON THE TABLE!

40:28.790 --> 40:30.485
>> I SAW SILAS PRINE TODAY. THE

40:30.490 --> 40:31.889
HEAD BELONGS TO HIS SISTER. HE

40:31.890 --> 40:35.758
WAS SCREWING HIS SISTER.

40:41.800 --> 40:43.529
>> JESUS.

40:43.540 --> 40:45.508
>> HER NAME WAS LAURA. SHE DIED

40:45.510 --> 40:47.728
IN A CAR ACCIDENT 4 YEARS AGO.

40:47.740 --> 40:49.935
PRINE BURIED THE BODY IN THE

40:49.940 --> 40:51.544
WOODS BY HIS HOUSE, BUT NOT

40:51.550 --> 40:52.778
BEFORE HE DECAPITATED HER FIRST

40:52.780 --> 40:55.578
AND KEPT THE HEAD FOR HIMSELF.

40:55.580 --> 40:57.673
>> DID YOU TELL THE POLICE WHO

40:57.680 --> 41:00.786
SHE WAS?

41:00.790 --> 41:02.257
>> THEY FOUND HER BODY THIS

41:02.260 --> 41:05.286
AFTERNOON, BUT TO GET HER

41:05.290 --> 41:06.951
IDENTITY, I HAD TO TELL PRINE

41:06.960 --> 41:08.825
I'D KEEP HER HEAD SAFE UNTIL HE

41:08.830 --> 41:12.561
WAS RELEASED...SO HE COULD BE

41:12.570 --> 41:19.134
WITH HER AGAIN. HE SAID I WAS

41:19.140 --> 41:24.942
LIKE HIM. HE WASN'T WRONG. LOOK

41:24.950 --> 41:26.577
AT HER. SHE'S PRACTICALLY A

41:26.580 --> 41:29.743
CORPSE. WE CAN'T PERFORM PLASTIC

41:29.750 --> 41:31.240
SURGERY ON HER. SHE NEEDS A

41:31.250 --> 41:34.811
FEEDING TUBE, NOT A FACE LIFT!

41:34.820 --> 41:39.587
CHRISTIAN, I KEEP TRYING TO PUT

41:39.590 --> 41:41.558
THE PIECES OF MY LIFE TOGETHER,

41:41.560 --> 41:43.289
TO REPAIR WHAT'S BROKEN, JULIA,

41:43.300 --> 41:52.663
MATT, THIS BUSINESS. I CAN'T.

41:52.670 --> 41:54.103
EVERYTHING I CARED ABOUT AT ONE

41:54.110 --> 41:58.035
TIME IS DEAD. IT'S TIME I JUST

41:58.040 --> 41:59.803
STOPPED FIGHTING THE INEVITABLE,

41:59.810 --> 42:06.909
LET IT ALL ROT.

42:06.920 --> 42:10.253
>> WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

42:10.260 --> 42:12.251
>> FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY

42:12.260 --> 42:16.549
LIFE, I DON'T KNOW.
