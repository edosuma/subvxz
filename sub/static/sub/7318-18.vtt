00:12.200 --> 00:13.633
PREVIOUSLY
ON "GREY'S ANATOMY...

00:13.667 --> 00:14.633
I'M GEORGE.

00:14.667 --> 00:16.633
WE MET AT THE MIXER.
YOU HAD ON A BLACK DRESS,

00:16.667 --> 00:18.600
STRAPPY SANDALS
AND A SLIT UP THE SIDE.

00:18.633 --> 00:21.400
I'VE HAD THIS THING FOR MY
ROOMMATE SINCE, LIKE, DAY ONE.

00:21.433 --> 00:22.533
SHE'S PRETTY GREAT,
YOU KNOW?

00:22.567 --> 00:24.433
WHO'S THATCH?
MY DAD.

00:24.467 --> 00:25.567
THATCHER.

00:25.600 --> 00:27.333
SHE NEVER TALKS
ABOUT HIM.

00:27.367 --> 00:29.033
I'M GLAD YOU MOVED IN.

00:29.067 --> 00:32.033
OH, SO SHE MOVED IN WITH YOU.
DIDN'T SHE TELL YOU?

00:32.067 --> 00:33.500
AND WHAT I KNOW NOW IS THAT
WHEN I GO INTO MY BEDROOM,

00:33.533 --> 00:36.400
I'M GONNA SEE THAT MY WIFE
IS CHEATING ON ME WITH MARK,

00:36.433 --> 00:38.533
WHO HAPPENED TO BE
MY BEST FRIEND.

00:38.567 --> 00:42.533

00:42.567 --> 00:44.467
(Meredith)
AFTER CAREFUL CONSIDERATION

00:44.500 --> 00:45.833
AND MANY SLEEPLESS NIGHTS,

00:45.867 --> 00:48.533
HERE'S WHAT I'VE DECIDED--

00:48.567 --> 00:52.533
THERE'S NO SUCH THING
AS A GROWN-UP.

00:52.567 --> 00:55.567
***

01:01.400 --> 01:03.233
***

01:03.267 --> 01:05.667
WE MOVE ON. WE MOVE OUT.

01:05.700 --> 01:07.600
WE MOVE AWAY
FROM OUR FAMILIES

01:07.633 --> 01:09.367
AND FORM OUR OWN.

01:09.400 --> 01:11.633
OH, N--

01:11.667 --> 01:12.600
NO.

01:12.633 --> 01:15.633

01:33.500 --> 01:35.533
OH. OH. OH.

01:38.267 --> 01:40.133
OW. HELLO?

NO. DR. BURKE.

***

01:44.800 --> 01:47.067
YES.

01:49.233 --> 01:52.067
YES, I'LL LET HER KNOW.

01:52.067 --> 01:55.100
***

01:55.133 --> 01:57.333
THAT WAS YOUR LANDLORD.

01:57.367 --> 01:58.667
HE WANTS YOU TO KNOW

01:58.700 --> 02:02.200
THAT THERE'S A MINOR FLOOD
IN YOUR APARTMENT.

02:02.233 --> 02:04.233
YOUR OTHER APARTMENT.

02:04.267 --> 02:07.367
BUT THE BASIC INSECURITIES,

02:07.400 --> 02:09.300
THE BASIC FEARS

02:09.333 --> 02:12.200
AND ALL THOSE OLD WOUNDS
JUST GROW UP WITH US.

02:12.233 --> 02:14.067
I'M EXHAUSTED.

02:14.100 --> 02:15.600
ME, TOO.

02:15.633 --> 02:17.733
AND JUST WHEN WE THINK
THAT LIFE AND CIRCUMSTANCE

02:17.767 --> 02:19.500
HAVE FORCED US TO TRULY,

02:19.533 --> 02:21.700
ONCE AND FOR ALL
BECOME AN ADULT...

02:21.733 --> 02:24.600
I WAS GOING AT IT ALL NIGHT
IN THE ON CALL ROOM.

02:24.633 --> 02:26.200
WHAT'S YOUR EXCUSE?

02:26.233 --> 02:28.600
YOUR MOTHER SAYS SOMETHING
LIKE THAT.

02:28.633 --> 02:29.833
MOM.

02:29.867 --> 02:33.233
I TELL YOU, THAT MAN
MAKES ME PURR LIKE A KITTEN.

02:33.267 --> 02:34.667
MOM.

02:34.700 --> 02:37.700
WHEN HE ISN'T MAKING ME
GROWL LIKE A TIGER.
STOP.

02:37.733 --> 02:38.767
(laughs)

02:38.800 --> 02:40.500
AND MY HUSBAND WONDERS

02:40.533 --> 02:42.433
WHY I'M NOT INTERESTED
IN HIM ANYMORE.

02:42.467 --> 02:43.533
OR WORSE,
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

02:43.567 --> 02:48.433
IF HE HAD ANY BALLS AT ALL,
HE WOULD LEAVE ON HIS OWN.

02:48.467 --> 02:51.100
NO. HE PLAYS STUPID.

02:51.133 --> 02:53.067
HE'S WAITING FOR ME
TO KICK HIM OUT.

02:53.067 --> 02:55.067
I COME HOME WITH A HICKEY
ON MY SHOULDER--

02:55.100 --> 02:57.067
A HICKEY, FOR GOD'S SAKE--

02:57.100 --> 02:58.833
LIKE I'M
SOME SEX-CRAZED TEENAGER,

02:58.867 --> 03:00.767
WHICH, LET'S FACE IT,
THESE DAYS, I AM,

03:00.800 --> 03:02.567
AND WHAT DOES THATCHER DO?

03:02.600 --> 03:05.467
PRETENDS HE DOESN'T SEE IT.

03:05.500 --> 03:07.533
WE GET BIGGER,

03:07.567 --> 03:09.467
WE GET TALLER,
WE GET OLDER,

03:09.500 --> 03:13.300
BUT... FOR THE MOST PART,
WE'RE STILL A BUNCH OF KIDS,

03:13.333 --> 03:17.100
RUNNING AROUND THE PLAYGROUND
TRYING DESPERATELY TO FIT IN.

03:17.133 --> 03:19.833
YOU KNOW, HE'S ACTING LIKE
I COMMITTED A CRIME,

03:19.867 --> 03:22.067
LIKE MY APARTMENT IS FULL
OF STOLEN GOODS.

03:22.067 --> 03:23.800
HE'S ACTING LIKE
I KEPT MY APARTMENT

03:23.833 --> 03:25.333
TO HIDE STOLEN GOODS

03:25.367 --> 03:27.267
SO I COULD DO
ILLEGAL TRANSPLANTS FOR MONEY.

03:27.300 --> 03:29.600
ARE YOU SURE HE'S NOT
JUST ACTING LIKE YOU LIED

03:29.633 --> 03:31.133
ABOUT MOVING IN?

03:31.167 --> 03:32.567
OKAY,
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

03:32.600 --> 03:36.467
MY MOMMY'S A FILTHY WHORE.

03:41.067 --> 03:43.500
(sighs) YOU HAVE DIRTY
IN YOUR EYES.

03:43.533 --> 03:45.167
YOU HAVE DIRTY
IN YOUR EYES.

03:45.200 --> 03:46.767
I'M NOT DOING DIRTY
WITH YOU ANYMORE.

03:46.800 --> 03:48.700
IT WAS A ONE-TIME
LAPSE IN JUDGMENT.

03:48.733 --> 03:51.600
WELL, IT WAS A 4-TIME
LAPSE IN JUDGMENT.

03:51.633 --> 03:54.567
(sighs) WELL, IT'S NOT
GONNA HAPPEN AGAIN.

03:54.600 --> 03:56.100
OH. OKAY.

03:56.133 --> 03:57.567
I'M SERIOUS.

03:57.600 --> 03:59.500
WE'RE FRIENDS,
AND IT DIDN'T WORK

03:59.533 --> 04:01.433
WHEN WE TRIED TO BE
MORE THAN THAT.

04:01.467 --> 04:03.433
SO...
(sighs) AS FUN AS IT WAS,

04:03.467 --> 04:05.333
IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN
AGAIN.

04:05.367 --> 04:07.533
STOP LOOKING AT ME.

04:07.567 --> 04:10.100
I'M NOT LOOKING AT YOU,
I'M ROUNDING.
I'M ROUNDING, TOO.

04:10.133 --> 04:12.367
FINE.
FINE.

04:12.400 --> 04:13.733

HE'S HAD EXTENSIVE
CHEMO-RADIOTHERAPY

04:22.667 --> 04:24.567
WITH MINIMAL REGRESSION
OF THE TUMOR.

04:24.600 --> 04:27.367
HE'S BEEN ADMITTED
FOR RADICAL EN BLOC RESECTION.

04:27.400 --> 04:29.600
I WAS A SMOKER.

04:29.633 --> 04:31.367
THE, UH, ONCOLOGIST...

04:31.400 --> 04:35.767
HE EXPLAINED THAT I HAVE
A 25% CHANCE

04:35.800 --> 04:37.333
OF SURVIVING THE, UH, SURGERY.

04:37.367 --> 04:39.267
WELL, UNFORTUNATELY,
THAT'S ABOUT RIGHT.

04:39.300 --> 04:41.200
IF YOU SHOULD ELECT
NOT TO PROCEED,

04:41.233 --> 04:44.467
WE CAN MAKE YOU
MORE COMFORTABLE.

04:46.333 --> 04:49.267
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, UH...

04:49.300 --> 04:50.400
THERE'S NO WAY

04:50.433 --> 04:54.167
THAT YOU CAN MAKE A MAN
DYING A SLOW DEATH COMFORTABLE.

04:54.200 --> 04:56.367
I'LL ROLL THE DICE.

04:56.400 --> 04:57.767
HOW DO I LOOK TODAY?

04:57.800 --> 04:59.733
WOULD YOU SAY, YOU KNOW,
I LOOK NICE?

04:59.767 --> 05:01.667
YOU COULD USE
A LITTLE MORE LIP GLOSS,

05:01.700 --> 05:03.600
BUT, YES,
YOU'RE VERY PRETTY.
AW, YOU'RE MEAN.

05:03.633 --> 05:05.533
I'M JUST KIDDING.
YOU LOOK FINE.

05:05.567 --> 05:07.067
SERIOUSLY, HOW'S MY BREATH?
(exhales)

05:07.100 --> 05:08.433
GEORGE.
YEAH.

05:08.467 --> 05:10.500
WOULD YOU JUST TALK
TO HER?
WHO?

05:10.533 --> 05:13.267
WHAT--
(baby talk voice)
GOOD MORNING, DR. BAILEY.

05:13.300 --> 05:15.333
HELLO, BABY.
ARE THE O.R.'s
UP AND RUNNING?

05:15.367 --> 05:17.067
UH, YEAH,
THEY'RE FULLY FUNCTIONAL.

05:17.067 --> 05:18.500
UH, EXCEPT THERE'S SOME
SMOKE DAMAGE TO THE CORRIDORS.

05:18.533 --> 05:19.800
HOW ABOUT YOU?
YOU FULLY FUNCTIONAL?

05:19.833 --> 05:21.300
I'M FINE.

05:21.333 --> 05:23.067
HOW'S YOUR HUSBAND?

05:23.067 --> 05:24.400
TAKING HIM HOME TOMORROW.

05:24.433 --> 05:27.767
(baby talk voice)
YES, WE ARE. YES. YES...

05:27.800 --> 05:30.533
(normal voice) OKAY,
THIS IS NOT A TEA PARTY.

05:30.567 --> 05:32.667
GO. WORK. SAVE SOME LIVES.

05:32.700 --> 05:35.700
NOW!

05:35.733 --> 05:39.167
(softly) DO IT NOW.

JAKE BURTON, 15, HAS ADVANCED
CRANIODIAPHYSEAL DYSPLASIA.

05:41.867 --> 05:42.967
(Derek) MM-HMM.

05:43.067 --> 05:45.133
WAS ADMITTED LAST NIGHT
AFTER COMPLAINING OF HEADACHES.

05:45.167 --> 05:47.067
AND HE'S NOT
A COMPLAINER.

05:47.100 --> 05:48.833
HE'S BEEN HAVING
SOME NAUSEA AS WELL.

05:48.867 --> 05:50.567
REALLY, OKAY?
MAY I, PLEASE?
MM-HMM.

05:50.600 --> 05:52.500
JAKE, CAN I GET YOU
TO SIT UP, PLEASE?
(Jake) SURE.

05:52.533 --> 05:53.567
ALL RIGHT, OKAY.

05:53.600 --> 05:56.367
NOW I WANT YOU TO LOOK
RIGHT HERE FOR ME. THANK YOU.

05:56.400 --> 05:57.833
GREAT, THANKS.

05:57.867 --> 05:59.700
YOU KNOW, IF YOU PRETEND
I'M A LION, IT HELPS.

05:59.733 --> 06:01.333
SORRY?

06:01.367 --> 06:02.700
IF YOU PRETEND I'M A LION

06:02.733 --> 06:04.633
INSTEAD OF
A REALLY MESSED UP KID,

06:04.667 --> 06:06.567
YOU GET A TALKING
CIRCUS ANIMAL,

06:06.600 --> 06:08.500
WHICH IS WAY EASIER
TO LOOK AT.

06:08.533 --> 06:10.300
DR. YANG, WHAT'S OUR
IMMEDIATE CONCERN?

06:10.333 --> 06:12.233
UH, THAT THE BONY TUMORS
ARE GROWING INWARD

06:12.267 --> 06:14.733
AND ENCROACHING ON HIS BRAIN.

06:21.367 --> 06:26.433
"INVASIVE NON-SMALL CELL
WITH A HISTORY OF C.O.P.D."?

06:26.467 --> 06:28.667
GUY'S PRETTY MUCH
A GONER, HUH?

06:28.700 --> 06:32.067
SENSITIVITY--I LIKE THAT
IN A STRANGER.

06:32.100 --> 06:33.433
ARE YOU NEW HERE?

06:33.467 --> 06:34.767
VISITING.

06:34.800 --> 06:36.100
CONFOUNDED BY ALL THE RAIN,

06:36.133 --> 06:38.067
AND IT'S ONLY
MY FIRST DAY IN TOWN.

06:38.067 --> 06:39.600
YOU GET USED TO IT.

06:39.633 --> 06:43.533
MAKES ME WANT
TO STAY IN BED ALL DAY.

06:43.567 --> 06:46.067
WE JUST MET, AND ALREADY
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT BED.

06:46.067 --> 06:47.667
NOT VERY SUBTLE.

06:47.700 --> 06:50.533
SUBTLE'S NEVER BEEN
MY STRONG SUIT.

06:50.567 --> 06:52.233
SO...

06:52.267 --> 06:54.600
DO YOU EVER GO OUT
WITH COWORKERS?

06:57.800 --> 07:01.700
I, UM, MAKE IT A RULE
NOT TO.

07:01.733 --> 07:05.133
THEN I AM SO GLAD
THAT I DON'T WORK HERE.

07:05.167 --> 07:07.133
ARE YOU HITTING ON ME

07:07.167 --> 07:09.333
IN A HOSPITAL?

07:09.367 --> 07:10.800
WOULD THAT BE WRONG?

07:12.333 --> 07:14.200
MEREDITH.

07:14.233 --> 07:16.167
(Derek grunts) OW.

07:16.200 --> 07:17.600
OW. AH.

07:17.633 --> 07:20.333
WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?

07:20.367 --> 07:22.067
THAT WAS MARK.

07:31.567 --> 07:32.733
PUNCHING OUT PEOPLE
ON MY SURGICAL FLOOR?

07:32.767 --> 07:35.133
MY HEAD OF NEUROSURGERY

07:35.167 --> 07:36.633
PUNCHING OUT PEOPLE
ON MY SURGICAL FLOOR?

07:36.667 --> 07:39.567
PUT THE ICE
BACK ON YOUR HAND, DEREK.
MY HAND IS FINE.

07:39.600 --> 07:42.333
PUT THE DAMN ICE ON
YOUR $2-MILLION-A-YEAR HAND.

07:42.367 --> 07:46.067
NOW... WOULD SOMEONE TELL ME
WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED?

07:49.167 --> 07:50.667
THAT WAS MARK.

07:50.700 --> 07:52.500
WHO'S MARK?

07:52.533 --> 07:54.300
HE AND DEREK
USED TO WORK TOGETHER

07:54.333 --> 07:57.067
BACK IN NEW YORK.

07:59.600 --> 08:01.633
AND, UH...

08:01.667 --> 08:06.067
THEY WERE--WE WERE
ALL CLOSE FRIENDS

08:06.100 --> 08:08.367
UNTIL...

08:08.400 --> 08:14.067
DEREK FOUND US
IN BED TOGETHER.

08:15.100 --> 08:16.833
YOU PUT YOUR WEIGHT
BEHIND IT?

08:16.867 --> 08:18.767
YES, SIR.

08:18.800 --> 08:21.633
WELL, ALL RIGHT, THEN.

08:27.233 --> 08:29.133
WHAT THE HELL
IS HE DOING HERE?

08:29.167 --> 08:31.200
I HAVE NO IDEA.

08:32.333 --> 08:35.200
DEREK AND I ALWAYS DID HAVE
THE SAME TASTE IN WOMEN.

08:35.233 --> 08:36.700
EXCUSE ME?

08:36.733 --> 08:39.100
YOU'RE DEREK'S
LUSTY INTERN, RIGHT?

08:39.133 --> 08:41.833
I HEARD ABOUT YOU
ALL THE WAY BACK IN NEW YORK.

08:41.867 --> 08:43.500
YOU'RE FAMOUS.

08:43.533 --> 08:44.800
(chuckles) WELL...

08:44.833 --> 08:47.700
I HEARD ABOUT YOU
ALL THE WAY HERE IN SEATTLE,

08:47.733 --> 08:50.600
SO I GUESS WE HAVE
A LOT IN COMMON.

08:50.633 --> 08:53.067
WE'RE THE DIRTY MISTRESSES.

08:53.067 --> 08:55.400
I SUPPOSE WE ARE.

08:55.433 --> 08:58.667
MY $400-AN-HOUR SHRINK
SAYS THAT IT'S BECAUSE

08:58.700 --> 09:01.167
BEHIND THIS RUGGED
AND CONFIDENT EXTERIOR,

09:01.200 --> 09:03.567
I'M SELF-DESTRUCTIVE
AND SELF-LOATHING

09:03.600 --> 09:05.700
TO AN ALMOST
PATHOLOGICAL DEGREE.

09:05.733 --> 09:08.467
HEY, WE DO HAVE
A LOT IN COMMON.

09:08.500 --> 09:11.667
YOU KNOW, IT'S FUNNY.
DER--

09:11.700 --> 09:14.433
DEREK WALKS IN ON ME NAKED
WITH HIS WIFE--

09:14.467 --> 09:18.367
ACTUALLY IN THE THROES--

09:18.400 --> 09:21.700
AND HE JUST TURNS AROUND
AND WALKS AWAY.

09:21.733 --> 09:24.833
BUT HE SEES ME
SO MUCH AS TALKING TO YOU,

09:24.867 --> 09:28.633
AND I'M
ON THE GROUND BLEEDING.

09:28.667 --> 09:31.533
INTERESTING,
DON'T YOU THINK?

09:36.567 --> 09:38.467
WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING?

09:38.500 --> 09:40.167
YOU NEED STITCHES.

09:40.200 --> 09:43.400
I KNOW. HOLD THE MIRROR.

09:53.633 --> 09:55.533
WHY IS HE SUTURING
HIS OWN FACE?

09:55.567 --> 09:56.767
TO TURN ME ON.

09:56.800 --> 09:58.433
BECAUSE HE'S MARK SLOAN.

09:58.467 --> 10:00.367
HE'S LIKE THE GO-TO
PLASTIC SURGEON

10:00.400 --> 10:01.500
ON THE EAST COAST.

10:01.533 --> 10:03.533
(whispers) THAT'S THE GUY
ADDISON WAS SLEEPING WITH?

10:03.567 --> 10:06.167
WELL, YOU CAN'T REALLY
BLAME HER, CAN YOU?
NO, NOT REALLY.

10:06.200 --> 10:07.400
YES, YOU CAN.

10:07.433 --> 10:09.333
McSEXY WANTS AN X-RAY
TO CHECK FOR FRACTURES,

10:09.367 --> 10:12.233
AND I THINK IT'S A BAD IDEA
IF I TAKE HIM.

10:12.267 --> 10:13.733
WHY? WHY?

10:13.767 --> 10:15.667
(Alex) I'M ON IT.
WHY IS IT A BAD IDEA?

10:15.700 --> 10:17.633
(Cristina) McSEXY?
NO?

10:17.667 --> 10:19.800
MM.
McYUMMY.

10:19.833 --> 10:22.200
NO.
NO.

10:22.233 --> 10:23.533
McSTEAMY.

10:23.567 --> 10:25.100
AH, THERE IT IS.

10:25.133 --> 10:26.433
YEP. (laughs)

10:26.467 --> 10:27.833
OH, EXCUSE ME,

10:27.867 --> 10:32.033
I'M JUST CHOKIN' BACK
SOME McVOMIT.

10:32.067 --> 10:33.367
OOH.

10:33.400 --> 10:36.133
I SAW HER FIRST.

10:36.167 --> 10:38.567
THE NIGHT SHE MET SHEPHERD,
I HAD HER EAR.

10:38.600 --> 10:42.733
WE TALKED, AND I CAN'T EVEN
REMEMBER WHAT I SAID.

10:42.767 --> 10:44.667
YOU KNOW WHEN YOU HAVEN'T
HAD SEX FOR AWHILE,

10:44.700 --> 10:46.767
YOU SORT OF FORGET
HOW GOOD IT IS

10:46.800 --> 10:48.700
AND DON'T REALLY NEED IT
AS MUCH?

10:48.733 --> 10:51.200
YEAH, THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN
TO GUYS.

10:51.233 --> 10:52.233
IT'S LIKE A BEAST--

10:52.267 --> 10:55.300
A BEAST THAT WAS ASLEEP
FOR A LONG, LONG TIME.

10:55.333 --> 10:57.233
AND NOW THE BEAST
IS WIDE AWAKE

10:57.267 --> 10:59.200
AND WANTS TO BE FED,

10:59.233 --> 11:01.133
AND THE FOOD
THAT ALEX GAVE IT WAS...

11:01.167 --> 11:02.533
IT WAS GOOD FOOD, GEORGE.

11:02.567 --> 11:04.700
SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE
ABOUT YOUR TASTE.

11:04.733 --> 11:06.067
AH! YOU'RE JUST JEALOUS

11:06.100 --> 11:07.833
BECAUSE YOU'RE BEAST
IS STILL ASLEEP.

11:07.867 --> 11:09.800
EH, MY BEAST
ISN'T ASLEEP.

11:09.833 --> 11:11.533
MY BEAST NEVER SLEEPS.

11:11.567 --> 11:13.567
(siren wails)

11:17.167 --> 11:19.433
MR. EATON.

11:19.467 --> 11:21.367
DO YOU NEED A HAND
WITH THAT?

11:21.400 --> 11:23.700
UM, IF YOU COULD SET UP
THE TRIPOD,

11:23.733 --> 11:25.233
THAT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL.

11:25.267 --> 11:26.800
ARE YOU--
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

11:26.833 --> 11:29.767
I'M DYING, DEAR.

11:29.800 --> 11:31.800
ONE IN FOUR--

11:31.833 --> 11:35.700
I, UH, I'VE NEVER DONE WELL
WITH ODDS LIKE THAT.

11:35.733 --> 11:37.300
SOME--SOME PEOPLE
ARE LUCKY.

11:37.333 --> 11:39.400
I JUST NEVER HAVE BEEN.

11:39.433 --> 11:42.800
THE CAMERA'S FOR POSTERITY,
FOR SAYING GOOD-BYE.

11:42.833 --> 11:45.767
DO YOU WANT ME TO HOLD
THE CAMERA FOR YOU?

11:45.800 --> 11:48.633
YOU'RE VERY KIND.
THANK YOU.

11:54.500 --> 11:56.500
OKAY, WE'RE RECORDING.

11:56.533 --> 11:57.467
(inhales)

11:57.500 --> 11:59.700
(sighs)

11:59.733 --> 12:03.333
THIS--THIS IS A MESSAGE
FOR SUZIE ZELMAN,

12:03.367 --> 12:05.333
MY--MY COLLEGE SWEETHEART

12:05.367 --> 12:08.067
AND--AND THE LOVE
OF MY LIFE.

12:08.100 --> 12:09.800
SUZIE...

12:09.833 --> 12:13.100
I LOVED YOU
WITH MY WHOLE HEART...

12:13.133 --> 12:15.733
AND I NEVER WOULD'VE
STOPPED LOVING YOU

12:15.767 --> 12:18.400
IF YOU HADN'T BEEN
THE VILEST WHORE

12:18.433 --> 12:20.067
TO EVER WALK
THE PLANET EARTH.

12:20.067 --> 12:22.267
YOU DESERVE THAT--
THAT DRUNKEN IMBECILE

12:22.300 --> 12:24.467
THAT YOU SLEPT WITH
AND THEN MARRIED.

12:24.500 --> 12:30.467
AND WHEN, AT THE REUNION,
I-I MET YOUR UGLY CHILDREN,

12:30.500 --> 12:34.300
I KNEW YOU HAD DONE ME
A REAL FAVOR.

12:34.333 --> 12:36.133
I AM SO DEEPLY HAPPY

12:36.167 --> 12:39.200
THAT I'LL NEVER HAVE TO SEE
YOUR FACE AGAIN.

12:40.667 --> 12:42.100
LOVE, CHUCK.

12:44.767 --> 12:47.700
WOULD YOU PLEASE, UH,
PUT IN A FRESH TAPE, DEAR?

12:47.733 --> 12:51.167
WHAT ABOUT THAT
JAW RECONSTRUCTION YOU DID

12:51.200 --> 12:54.100
USING A MICROVASCULAR
FREE TRANSFER FROM THE FOOT?

12:54.133 --> 12:56.400
YOU INTERESTED IN PLASTICS?

12:56.433 --> 12:58.233
ABSOLUTELY.

12:58.267 --> 13:00.167
YOU MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER
A TRANSFER

13:00.200 --> 13:02.100
TO NEW YORK OR LOS ANGELES.

13:02.133 --> 13:04.067
YOU'RE NOT GONNA SEE
ANY HEAT UP HERE.

13:04.067 --> 13:05.667
WELL, ACTUALLY...

13:05.700 --> 13:10.733
YOU EVER SEEN AN ADVANCED CASE
OF CRANIODIAPHYSEAL DYSPLASIA?

13:10.767 --> 13:12.500
LIONITIS?

13:12.533 --> 13:13.567
YEAH.

13:13.600 --> 13:16.067
RESTRAINED DRIVER
IN A MINOR M.V.C.

13:16.067 --> 13:17.133
VITALS ARE STABLE,
BUT WITNESSES SAW

13:17.167 --> 13:18.867
SEIZURE ACTIVITY
BEHIND THE WHEEL.

13:18.900 --> 13:22.333
I REALLY DON'T THINK
I NEED TO BE HERE.
YOU SHOULD REALLY LET US
DETERMINE THAT, MA'AM.

13:22.367 --> 13:24.133
WITNESSES SAID SHE WAS
SCREAMING, SHUDDERING

13:24.167 --> 13:25.533
AND--AND CLAMPING HER JAW.

13:25.567 --> 13:27.700
DO YOU HAVE A SEIZURE DISORDER
THAT YOU'RE AWARE OF?
(Izzie) EPILEPSY?

13:27.733 --> 13:29.633
IT'S NOT EPILEPSY.
I DON'T HAVE ANY--

13:29.667 --> 13:32.733
OH, NO. OH, GOD.
IT'S HAPPENING AGAIN.

13:32.767 --> 13:34.667
OH, NO.

13:34.700 --> 13:38.267
(moaning)

13:54.800 --> 13:56.567
WAS THAT A...

13:56.600 --> 13:57.767
DID SHE JUST HAVE A...

13:57.800 --> 14:00.800
ORGASM.

14:05.567 --> 14:07.233
SPONTANEOUS ORGASMS.

14:07.267 --> 14:08.467
ARE YOU SURE?

14:08.500 --> 14:12.067
OH, YEAH.
KINDA HARD TO MISS.

14:12.067 --> 14:15.067
OKAY. (clears throat)

14:15.100 --> 14:16.633
MS. CALVA,
I'M DR. MONTGOMERY-SHEPHERD.

14:16.667 --> 14:17.833
IT'S PAMELA.

14:17.867 --> 14:19.767
SINCE WE'RE GONNA BE
TALKING ABOUT... YOU KNOW,

14:19.800 --> 14:20.533
MAY AS WELL GET FAMILIAR.

14:20.567 --> 14:22.300
OKAY, PAMELA,
CAN YOU TELL ME

14:22.333 --> 14:23.667
HOW LONG THIS HAS
BEEN HAPPENING TO YOU?

14:23.700 --> 14:27.333
FOR A FEW MONTHS,
I GUESS.
HOW OFTEN?

14:27.367 --> 14:29.133
ABOUT, I DON'T KNOW,
SEVEN OR EIGHT TIMES A DAY.

14:29.167 --> 14:31.067
EVERY DAY?

14:31.100 --> 14:32.233
UH, DR. STEVENS.

14:32.267 --> 14:33.800
I'M SORRY.

14:33.833 --> 14:35.233
EVERY DAY?

14:35.267 --> 14:37.233
YES, EVERY DAY.

14:37.267 --> 14:40.133
AND YOU HAVEN'T SEEN
A DOCTOR ABOUT THIS BEFORE?

14:40.167 --> 14:42.733
IT'S NOT EXACTLY SOMETHING
YOU WANT TO CURE, IS IT?
DR. O'MALLEY.

14:42.767 --> 14:43.733
SORRY.

14:43.767 --> 14:45.433
(mumbles) IS IT?

14:45.467 --> 14:47.333
I WENT TO MY DOCTOR.
HE SENT ME TO A SHRINK.

14:47.367 --> 14:49.233
AND HE DIDN'T DO
ANY TESTS?

14:49.267 --> 14:52.433
(man) PAMMY,
YOU BACK HERE?

14:52.467 --> 14:54.233
OH, GOD, NO.
YOU CALLED MY FATHER?

14:54.267 --> 14:56.767
HE'S YOUR EMERGENCY
CONTACT PERSON.

14:56.800 --> 15:00.700
PAMMY, WHAT HAPPENED?
YOU WERE IN AN ACCIDENT?

15:00.733 --> 15:02.600
I CAUSED THE ACCIDENT, DAD.

15:02.633 --> 15:03.767
YOU HAD ONE OF YOUR--

15:03.800 --> 15:06.067
EPISODES. YEAH.

15:06.067 --> 15:08.633
OH, NO.

15:08.667 --> 15:11.467
DANG IT.

15:11.500 --> 15:15.333
(muffled moaning)

15:15.367 --> 15:18.067
SHE'S A JUNIOR AT U-DUB.

15:18.067 --> 15:20.800
SHE'S A MATH MAJOR.

15:20.833 --> 15:23.300
THE LAST THREE SEMESTERS,
SHE MADE THE HONOR ROLL.

15:23.333 --> 15:25.800
HIGH UP IN THE HONOR ROLL.

15:25.833 --> 15:29.833
MR. CALVA, WE'RE GONNA...
RUN SOME TESTS

15:29.867 --> 15:31.500
AND WE'RE GONNA...

15:31.533 --> 15:34.367
WE'RE GONNA FIGURE OUT WHAT'S
CAUSING YOUR DAUGHTER'S--

15:34.400 --> 15:35.333
EPISODES.

15:35.367 --> 15:37.200
THAT'S RIGHT, EPISODES.
OKAY.

15:37.233 --> 15:38.200
AND WHEN YOU WERE 14,

15:38.233 --> 15:41.833
YOU STOLE LAURA BRENDESE
RIGHT OUT FROM UNDER ME.

15:41.867 --> 15:43.767
YOU KNEW HOW I FELT ABOUT HER.

15:43.800 --> 15:46.400
DON'T SAY YOU DIDN'T KNOW
BECAUSE YOU KNEW.

15:46.433 --> 15:48.600
AND YOU WENT FOR HER ANYWAY.

15:48.633 --> 15:51.633
WHAT KIND OF HUMAN BEING
DOES THAT TO HIS LITTLE BROTHER?

15:51.667 --> 15:55.600
HE WAS 14. CUT HIM SOME SLACK
FOR GOD'S SAKES.

15:55.633 --> 15:57.467
OH, I'M SORRY.

15:57.500 --> 15:59.333
I FORGOT WE WERE RECORDING.

15:59.367 --> 16:01.300
IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND
JUST REWINDING

16:01.333 --> 16:03.500
A LITTLE BIT, PLEASE?

16:03.533 --> 16:05.067
(closes video camera)

16:05.100 --> 16:06.833
I'M A DOCTOR,
NOT A VIDEOGRAPHER.

16:06.867 --> 16:09.233
AND I DO NEED TO PREP YOU
FOR SURGERY.

16:09.267 --> 16:11.233
BUT YOU OFFERED TO HELP.

16:11.267 --> 16:13.167
WHEN I THOUGHT
YOU WERE SAYING GOOD-BYE.

16:13.200 --> 16:15.733
I AM SAYING GOOD-BYE.

16:15.767 --> 16:17.667
NONE OF THESE PEOPLE--
NOT ONE OF THEM--

16:17.700 --> 16:20.567
KNOWS HOW I REALLY FEEL.

16:20.600 --> 16:24.333
MY WHOLE LIFE,
I'VE KEPT IT ALL INSIDE.

16:24.367 --> 16:28.133
I-I DON'T WANT TO CARRY THIS
WITH ME TO MY GRAVE.

16:28.167 --> 16:30.067
YOU SEEM LIKE
SUCH A NICE MAN.

16:30.100 --> 16:33.800
WOULDN'T YOU JUST RATHER
YOU REMEMBER YOU THAT WAY?

16:33.833 --> 16:36.800
NO.

16:36.833 --> 16:38.633
PLEASE REWIND THE TAPE.

16:40.533 --> 16:41.667
(Cristina) OKAY, JAKE,

16:41.700 --> 16:43.600
IT CAN GET
A LITTLE CRAMPED IN THERE,

16:43.633 --> 16:45.533
SO YOU HAVE TO TRY
NOT TO MOVE.

16:45.567 --> 16:49.300
YEAH, UH, THIS IS, LIKE,
MY 50th M.R.I. EXPERIENCE.

16:49.333 --> 16:50.667
RIGHT, SORRY.

16:50.700 --> 16:52.133
IT'S OKAY.

16:52.167 --> 16:55.267
YOU HAVE REALLY NICE EYES,
YOU KNOW?

16:56.500 --> 16:57.833
WELL, I'M JUST SAYIN' THAT

16:57.867 --> 17:00.333
YOU'RE MOSTLY ALL--
ALL SURLY AND HARD CORE,

17:00.367 --> 17:02.567
BUT YOUR EYES AREN'T.

17:02.600 --> 17:03.800
I'M REALLY BIG ON EYES.

17:03.833 --> 17:07.167
THEY'RE THE ONLY PART OF MY FACE
WHERE TUMORS AREN'T GROWING.

17:08.700 --> 17:10.367
YEAH, YOU'VE GOT
NICE EYES.

17:10.400 --> 17:11.333
YEAH?

17:11.367 --> 17:12.300
MM-HMM.

17:12.333 --> 17:15.300
YOU--YOU GET THAT--
THAT I'M JAILBAIT, RIGHT?

17:18.633 --> 17:19.567
MEREDITH.

17:19.600 --> 17:21.800
CHIEF.

17:21.833 --> 17:24.600
CHIEF,
CAN I ASK YOU SOMETHING

17:24.633 --> 17:26.633
NOT WORK-RELATED?

17:26.667 --> 17:28.067
OKAY.

17:28.100 --> 17:31.067
DO YOU REMEMBER MY FATHER?

17:32.600 --> 17:34.300
OF COURSE.

17:34.333 --> 17:36.200
DO YOU KNOW WHY HE LEFT?

17:36.233 --> 17:40.367
I BELIEVE YOUR MOTHER
ASKED HIM TO.

17:40.400 --> 17:42.433
RIGHT, BUT DO YOU KNOW WHY?

17:44.500 --> 17:46.267
NO.

17:46.300 --> 17:48.667
NO, I'M SORRY. I DON'T.

17:48.700 --> 17:50.167
WELL...

17:50.200 --> 17:51.567
HAVE A GOOD DAY.

17:51.600 --> 17:53.167
THANKS. YOU, TOO.

17:55.533 --> 17:58.767
DR. YANG, BOOK AN O.R.

17:58.800 --> 18:00.767
HOW--HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE?

18:00.800 --> 18:02.567
IT'S PRECISION WORK.

18:02.600 --> 18:04.133
IT WON'T BE EASY, BUT--

18:04.167 --> 18:06.367
DR. SLOAN, CAN I HELP YOU
WITH SOMETHING?

18:06.400 --> 18:08.267
(Jake) HE SAYS
HE CAN FIX MY FACE.

18:08.300 --> 18:10.733
HE SAYS HE CAN MAKE ME
LOOK LIKE NORMAL.

18:10.767 --> 18:16.233
***

18:16.267 --> 18:18.567
WHAT DID HE SAY?
DID YOU HEAR THAT?
DID HE CALL HIM
A CRACK WHORE?

18:18.600 --> 18:20.367
WHY WOULD HE CALL HIM
A CRACK WHORE?

18:20.400 --> 18:22.300
OH, SHUT UP.
I'M TRYING TO READ LIPS.
SHUT UP, CRACK WHORE.

18:22.333 --> 18:24.233
LOOK, SHEPHERD'S GESTURING.
BIG GESTURING.

18:24.267 --> 18:26.500
WHAT DO YOU GOT?
SHEPHERD AND SLOAN

18:26.533 --> 18:29.167
OH, IT'S GETTIN' GOOD.

18:29.200 --> 18:31.167
WHY, WHAT DO YOU GOT?

18:31.200 --> 18:34.100
JUST A WOMAN
DOWN IN THE E.R...

18:34.133 --> 18:37.733
HAVING SPONTANEOUS ORGASMS.

18:37.767 --> 18:40.500
***

18:40.533 --> 18:42.467
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT. WAIT.

18:42.500 --> 18:43.733
THAT IS NOT THE POINT.

18:43.767 --> 18:46.400
THE POINT IS THE KID WANTS HIS
FACE FIXED AND I WANT TO DO IT.

18:46.433 --> 18:48.367
THE POINT IS,
YOU WANNA GET PUBLISHED!
WELL, YEAH.

18:48.400 --> 18:50.300
AND I'M GUESSING YOUR CHIEF

18:50.333 --> 18:52.133

18:52.167 --> 18:54.400
A GOOD BEFORE AND AFTER SHOT,

18:56.833 --> 18:58.733
DEREK,
OUT OF FRIENDSHIP TO YOU,

18:58.767 --> 19:02.700
I WOULD VERY MUCH LOVE
TO SAY NO TO THIS JACKASS.

19:02.733 --> 19:05.567
BUT AS CHIEF--
PLEASE DON'T SAY IT.

19:05.600 --> 19:07.633
DR. SLOAN, IF YOU CAN GET
THE PARENTS

19:07.667 --> 19:10.333
TO SIGN A CONSENT FORM...

19:10.367 --> 19:13.333
ROUND TWO GOES TO
THE JACKASS.

19:13.367 --> 19:15.700

19:18.433 --> 19:20.433

WHICH ONE? WHICH ONE?
12:00.

19:20.467 --> 19:22.200
OH, GOD. OH, NO.

19:22.233 --> 19:25.067
OH, NO.
OH, IT'S HAPPENING.

19:25.100 --> 19:30.333
(moaning)

19:30.367 --> 19:33.133
DOCTORS,
THERE SOMETHING YOU NEED?

19:33.167 --> 19:34.500
NO. NO.
NO, WE'RE GOOD.

19:34.533 --> 19:37.300
WELL, IN THAT CASE,
MOVE ON.

19:37.333 --> 19:40.600
(moaning continues)

19:40.633 --> 19:43.100
ANYONE GET WHAT McDREAMY
OR McSTEAMY SEES IN HER?

19:43.133 --> 19:44.467
SHE'S McHOT.

19:44.500 --> 19:46.067
McYEAH, SHE IS.

19:46.100 --> 19:49.100
***

19:55.333 --> 19:56.667
OH, COME ON.

19:56.700 --> 19:59.567
YOU'RE NOT EVEN
A LITTLE BIT HAPPY TO SEE ME?

19:59.600 --> 20:01.500
GO HOME. WHATEVER IT IS
YOU CAME HERE TO DO,

20:01.533 --> 20:02.733
JUST DROP IT AND LEAVE.

20:02.767 --> 20:05.233
HEY, WE ALL MADE MISTAKES,
ADDISON, ALL THREE OF US...
MARK--

20:05.267 --> 20:07.167
BUT SOMEHOW--SOMEHOW,
I LOST MY BEST FRIEND

20:07.200 --> 20:08.533
AND THE WOMAN I LOVED.

20:08.567 --> 20:10.100
PLEASE... DON'T SAY THAT.

20:10.133 --> 20:11.533
HE DOESN'T KNOW
HOW WE FELT.

20:11.567 --> 20:15.200
HE DOESN'T KNOW YOU STAYED
WITH ME AFTER HE LEFT.

20:15.233 --> 20:17.133
HOW DO YOU EXPECT
TO WORK OUT A MARRIAGE

20:17.167 --> 20:19.267
IF YOU CAN'T EVEN
BE HONEST WITH HIM?

20:19.300 --> 20:20.633
WHY ARE YOU HERE?

20:20.667 --> 20:24.833
FOR ONE REASON--
TO BRING YOU HOME.

20:24.867 --> 20:28.300
I MISS YOU, ADDISON.

20:28.333 --> 20:32.067
I'M IN LOVE
WITH MY HUSBAND, MARK.

20:32.100 --> 20:34.133
BUT HE'S NOT IN LOVE
WITH YOU.

20:34.167 --> 20:36.067
HE'S IN LOVE
WITH THAT INTERN,

20:36.100 --> 20:38.667
AND HE'S NOT EVEN TRYING
TO HIDE IT.

20:38.700 --> 20:41.333
NOW WHY WOULD YOU WANT
TO STICK AROUND FOR THAT?

20:41.367 --> 20:44.367
***

20:48.633 --> 20:50.333
I THINK YOU'RE
MAKING IT UP.

20:50.367 --> 20:53.333
I'M NOT.
I SAW IT FOUR TIMES.
WHAT?

20:53.367 --> 20:56.400
A WOMAN WITH
SPONTANEOUS ORGASMS.
(Cristina) UH-HUH.

20:56.433 --> 20:59.133
YOU'RE JUST JEALOUS 'CAUSE
YOU DIDN'T SEE IT YOURSELF.

20:59.167 --> 21:01.233
OH, I TOTALLY AM.

21:01.267 --> 21:03.100
(Meredith)
SPONTANEOUS ORGASMS, REALLY?

21:03.133 --> 21:05.233
YOU LOOK REALLY NICE TODAY.
ANY CHANCE
THEY'RE CONTAGIOUS?

21:05.267 --> 21:07.300
SPONTANEOUS ORGASMS,

21:07.333 --> 21:09.433
THAT WOULD SOLVE
SO MANY PROBLEMS.

21:09.467 --> 21:12.133
(laughs) IT WOULD. IT WOULD.
I THINK YOU SMELL NICE, TOO.

21:12.167 --> 21:14.067
YOU KNOW, IT'S LIKE,
YOU SEE SOMEONE THROW UP,

21:14.100 --> 21:16.433
IT MAKES YOU WANT TO
THROW UP, TOO. KINDA LIKE THAT?

21:16.467 --> 21:17.800
KINDA LIKE.

21:19.200 --> 21:21.100
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M NOT HUNGRY.

21:21.133 --> 21:23.067
DO YOU HEAR ME?
I'M NOT HUNGRY.

21:23.067 --> 21:25.100
NEITHER IS THE BEAST.

21:25.133 --> 21:26.467
"THE BEAST"--IS THAT, LIKE,

21:26.500 --> 21:28.200
SOME SLY REFERENCE
TO YOUR PENIS?

21:28.233 --> 21:30.733
GET YOUR MIND OUT OF
THE GUTTER, CRACK WHORE.

21:30.767 --> 21:32.533
(laughter)

21:32.567 --> 21:33.633
NO, IT'S NOT ALEX'S PENIS.
IT'S--

21:33.667 --> 21:36.400
YOU KNOW WHEN YOU HAVEN'T HAD
SEX FOR A LONG TIME

21:36.433 --> 21:38.767
AND YOU FORGET HOW GOOD IT IS,
AND SO YOU WANT IT LESS?

21:38.800 --> 21:41.200
YEAH, THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN
TO ME.
ME EITHER.

21:41.233 --> 21:43.200
ME EITHER.

21:45.100 --> 21:46.833
I GREW MY HAIR FOR HER,
AND...

21:46.867 --> 21:48.200
I KNOW.

21:48.233 --> 21:50.233
I DON'T EVEN THINK
SHE'S NOTICED.

21:50.267 --> 21:53.800
YOU COULD JUST TRY
TELLING HER HOW YOU FEEL.

21:53.833 --> 21:55.567
(man) UM, GUYS?

21:55.600 --> 21:57.567
UM, SHE'S MOVING,

21:57.600 --> 21:59.433
LIKE, A LOT.

21:59.467 --> 22:01.700
PAMELA,
YOU HAVE TO HOLD STILL.

22:01.733 --> 22:05.200
(moaning)

22:05.233 --> 22:07.233
OH. AHEM.

22:07.267 --> 22:09.200
OKAY.

22:11.800 --> 22:14.767
THAT'S NOT HELPING
THE BEAST SLEEP, IS IT?

22:14.800 --> 22:16.267
NO.
(laughing)

22:16.300 --> 22:17.733
NO, IT'S NOT.

22:17.767 --> 22:20.100
YOU'RE DRAWING THE MEDIAL
TO THE TUMOR.

22:20.133 --> 22:21.500
YEAH, IT'S A GUIDELINE

22:21.533 --> 22:23.833
FOR WHAT THE BONE STRUCTURE
SHOULD BE.

22:23.867 --> 22:28.300
HEAR THAT?
I'M GONNA HAVE BONE STRUCTURE.

22:28.333 --> 22:29.267
JAKE...

22:29.300 --> 22:30.433
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK,

22:30.467 --> 22:33.400
AM I A DALí
OR MORE OF A PICASSO?

22:35.100 --> 22:37.167
COULD YOU STOP DOING THAT
FOR A MINUTE, PLEASE?

22:40.367 --> 22:42.233
JAKE...

22:42.267 --> 22:45.533
JAKE... I'M SORRY.

22:45.567 --> 22:47.667
THIS SURGERY,
THE BRAIN SURGERY,

22:47.700 --> 22:49.400
IS VERY DANGEROUS.

22:49.433 --> 22:50.600
NO, DON'T SAY THAT.

22:50.633 --> 22:52.633
Y-YOU DON'T GET
TO CHANGE YOUR MIND.

22:52.667 --> 22:55.600
YOU KNOW, I KNOW DR. SLOAN
HAS MADE YOU SOME BIG PROMISES,

22:55.633 --> 23:00.400
BUT THE BONY TUMORS
INSIDE YOUR SKULL ARE BAD.

23:00.433 --> 23:02.833
I DON'T CARE.
THE BLEEDING WILL BE
HARD TO CONTROL.

23:02.867 --> 23:05.133
I'M NOT TRYING TO FRIGHTEN YOU,
I JUST WANT YOU TO UNDER--

23:05.167 --> 23:06.667
I DO UNDERSTAND.
I UNDERSTAND

23:06.700 --> 23:08.600
THAT THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH THE PLASTIC SURGERY.

23:08.633 --> 23:11.467
SO IF I'M GONNA BE UNDER
THE KNIFE ANYWAY, THEN--
THE PLASTIC SURGERY COULD--

23:11.500 --> 23:14.267
SORRY TO INTERRUPT--
WHAT YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND--

23:14.300 --> 23:16.200
EXCUSE ME.
JAKE IS ACTUALLY RIGHT.
(Derek scoffs)

23:16.233 --> 23:18.133
NO REASON TO PUT HIM THROUGH
A SECOND SURGERY

23:18.167 --> 23:20.067
AND A SECOND ROUND
OF ANESTHESIA.

23:20.100 --> 23:22.067
IT'S MUCH SAFER JUST TO
DO IT ALL AT ONCE.

23:22.100 --> 23:24.833
HONEY, WE JUST WANT TO FOCUS
ON KEEPING YOU ALIVE.

23:24.867 --> 23:27.733
MOM, I-I ALMOST DIED
WHEN I WAS 10 YEARS OLD.

23:27.767 --> 23:30.567
AND THEN AGAIN
WHEN I WAS 12.

23:30.600 --> 23:31.733
AND THEN AGAIN LAST YEAR.

23:31.767 --> 23:34.133
BUT... (sighs)

23:34.167 --> 23:35.700
BUT I'M STILL ALIVE.

23:35.733 --> 23:37.767
I'M STILL ALIVE,
SO I SAY WE GO FOR IT.

23:37.800 --> 23:39.600
JAKE...

23:39.633 --> 23:42.500
LOOK, I KNOW THAT YOU THINK
I'M PERFECT JUST THE WAY I AM--

23:42.533 --> 23:44.433
BUT THAT'S YOUR JOB
TO DO THAT.

23:44.467 --> 23:50.133
BUT... FOR ONCE IN MY LIFE,
I'D LIKE TO THINK

23:50.167 --> 23:54.600
THAT SOMEONE ELSE
THOUGHT THAT.

23:54.633 --> 23:56.167
PLEASE.

24:00.633 --> 24:03.333
PLEASE.

24:13.833 --> 24:17.133
YOU'VE GIVEN UP SURGERY
TO GO INTO CLERICAL WORK?

24:17.167 --> 24:19.667
I'M FULFILLING A PATIENT'S
DYING WISH

24:19.700 --> 24:22.767
BY SENDING HATE MAIL
TO EVERYONE HE'S EVER MET.

24:22.800 --> 24:24.700
YEAH, RIGHT NOW
I UNDERSTAND THE IMPULSE.

24:24.733 --> 24:26.500
ME, TOO.

24:26.533 --> 24:28.300
WHY DO PEOPLE CHEAT?

24:28.333 --> 24:30.167
THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION.

24:30.200 --> 24:33.167
WHY DO YOU THINK
SHE CHEATED ON YOU?

24:33.200 --> 24:35.467
WERE YOU DIFFERENT THEN?

24:35.500 --> 24:38.333
WERE YOU A BAD HUSBAND?

24:42.233 --> 24:45.567
I WAS, UH...

24:45.600 --> 24:51.800
OH, I WAS JUST A LITTLE...
ABSENT.

24:51.833 --> 24:55.300
NOT THAT
THAT'S AN EXCUSE FOR HER.

24:56.533 --> 24:58.433
DO YOU THINK THINGS
WOULD'VE BEEN DIFFERENT

24:58.467 --> 25:00.100
IF YOU'D HAD KIDS?

25:00.133 --> 25:03.467
DO I THINK
SHE WOULDN'T HAVE CHEATED?

25:06.600 --> 25:09.100
I DON'T KNOW.

25:09.133 --> 25:12.467
ALL RIGHT, MAN,
JAKE'S READY TO ROLL.

25:12.500 --> 25:14.433
I'M SORRY.
DID I INTERRUPT SOMETHING?

25:14.467 --> 25:16.400
NO. IT'S FINE.

25:21.167 --> 25:23.333
PAMELA, YOU SHOULD REALLY
TRY AND RELAX.

25:23.367 --> 25:25.700
I AM TRYING TO RELAX.

25:25.733 --> 25:30.067
THE EPISODES HAPPEN
WHEN I DON'T RELAX.

25:30.067 --> 25:34.633
DO YOU REALLY THINK
YOU CAN FIX THIS?

25:36.067 --> 25:39.067
I, UH, I HATE TO BE
INSENSITIVE, BUT...

25:39.067 --> 25:41.367
WOULD IT BE THE WORST THING
EVER IF WE CAN'T?

25:41.400 --> 25:42.733
I MEAN...

25:42.767 --> 25:45.633
YOU KNOW, I LIKE SEX
AS MUCH AS THE NEXT GIRL,

25:45.667 --> 25:49.167
LIKE IN BED
OR EVEN IN PRIVATE.

25:49.200 --> 25:51.100
BUT WHEN YOU CAN'T GO
TO THE MOVIES

25:51.133 --> 25:53.200
OR DRIVE A CAR

25:53.233 --> 25:56.467
OR GO TO CHURCH
WITH YOUR PARENTS...

25:56.500 --> 25:58.633
OH, MY GOD.

25:58.667 --> 26:00.367
YOU KNOW THAT DREAM

26:00.400 --> 26:02.300
WHERE YOU SHOW UP
AT HIGH SCHOOL

26:02.333 --> 26:03.467
AND YOU'RE NAKED?

26:03.500 --> 26:05.200
YEAH.

26:05.233 --> 26:09.300
YEAH, WELL, I WOULD REALLY,
REALLY LIKE TO WAKE UP.

26:09.333 --> 26:13.100
***

26:15.833 --> 26:18.633
IT'S CROSSED
THE INTRATHORACIC FASCIA?

26:18.667 --> 26:20.567
I'M AFRAID SO.

26:20.600 --> 26:25.067
I'M GONNA HAVE TO GO
INTO THE CHEST WALL.

26:25.100 --> 26:27.400
HE MADE 17 HATE TAPES.

26:27.433 --> 26:28.767
I'M SORRY?

26:28.800 --> 26:30.467
VIDEOTAPES OF HIMSELF

26:30.500 --> 26:33.067
TELLING PEOPLE
HOW MUCH HE HATED THEM,

26:33.100 --> 26:35.433
SPEWING EVERY HURT FEELING
HE EVER HAD.

26:35.467 --> 26:37.133
AND HE MAILED THEM?
NO.

26:37.167 --> 26:40.067
HE WANTED ME TO, BUT I DON'T
THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA.

26:40.067 --> 26:41.700
HE WAS SCARED.

26:41.733 --> 26:44.700
HE WAS IN SHOCK.
HE WASN'T THINKING CLEARLY.

26:44.733 --> 26:47.833
THAT'S NOT FOR YOU
TO DECIDE, DR. GREY.

26:47.867 --> 26:50.333
HE ASKED YOU FOR SOMETHING,

26:50.367 --> 26:52.267
AND YOU TOLD HIM
YOU WOULD DO IT.

26:52.300 --> 26:54.400
IF YOU DON'T,
THAT DOESN'T MAKE YOU NOBLE.

26:54.433 --> 26:56.233
IT MAKES YOU A LIAR.

27:03.800 --> 27:07.733

DR. SHEPHERD
IS OPENING THE SKULL-CAP.

27:17.367 --> 27:20.300
(Alex) IS IT HARDER TO GET
THROUGH THE BONY TUMORS?
(Derek) IT'S A LITTLE
MORE DENSE.

27:20.333 --> 27:22.233
THAT'S WHAT HE'S DOIN'.
YES, HE IS.

27:22.267 --> 27:23.800
BASIN.

27:23.833 --> 27:25.500
THIS IS DONE.

27:25.533 --> 27:27.633
COTTONOID.
HANG ANOTHER UNIT OF BLOOD.

27:27.667 --> 27:29.567
(Cristina) I'VE GOT IT.

27:29.600 --> 27:32.133

NO CAROTID.

YEAH.

28:28.633 --> 28:30.300
ALL RIGHT.

28:30.333 --> 28:33.400

REALLY NEED THOSE.

31:13.200 --> 31:16.667
I DID. I-I TRIED.

31:16.700 --> 31:19.400
WHY DIDN'T YOU TRY HARDER?

31:19.433 --> 31:22.133
YOU JUST LEFT.

31:22.167 --> 31:25.067
***

31:25.067 --> 31:27.267
MEREDITH...

31:32.733 --> 31:36.633
IS THERE ANYTHING
THAT YOU NEED?

31:36.667 --> 31:39.633
A-ANYTHING AT ALL?

31:39.667 --> 31:41.567
***

31:41.600 --> 31:43.267
NO.

31:43.300 --> 31:46.533
***

31:48.200 --> 31:51.067
I DON'T NEED ANYTHING
FROM YOU.

31:53.167 --> 31:56.167
***

32:09.200 --> 32:12.200
***

32:15.233 --> 32:16.167
HEY.

32:16.200 --> 32:17.133
HEY.

32:17.167 --> 32:19.533
I HAVEN'T SEE YOU
ALL DAY.

32:19.567 --> 32:22.300
I DIDN'T WANT
TO SEE YOU TODAY.

32:22.333 --> 32:25.200
IT'S NOT MY FAULT
HE SHOWED UP, DEREK.

32:25.233 --> 32:27.533
I KNOW.

32:27.567 --> 32:30.567
***

32:35.300 --> 32:37.267
DON'T BEAT YOURSELF UP--

32:37.300 --> 32:38.667
I'M GONNA TAKE THE STAIRS.

32:38.700 --> 32:40.167
OH, COME ON.
DEREK.

32:40.200 --> 32:42.100
HOW COME YOU CAN
FORGIVE HER BUT NOT ME?

32:42.133 --> 32:44.467
I DIDN'T FORGIVE HER,
AND WITH YOU

32:44.500 --> 32:46.500
I HAVE NO OBLIGATION
TO TRY.

32:48.433 --> 32:50.333
***

32:50.367 --> 32:53.200
YOUR MARRIAGE IS OVER,
ADDISON.

32:53.233 --> 32:56.700
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
IS ADMIT IT.

32:58.367 --> 33:02.233
THEN YOU CAN COME BACK HOME
WITH ME.

33:02.267 --> 33:06.600
I'M GOIN' TO THE BAR
ACROSS THE STREET.

33:09.400 --> 33:10.733
MEET ME THERE.

33:10.767 --> 33:13.767
***

33:23.767 --> 33:26.767
***

33:40.667 --> 33:44.533
HE LOOKS...

33:44.567 --> 33:46.600
PEACEFUL.

33:50.133 --> 33:52.333
HE DOES.

34:24.433 --> 34:27.433
(clock ticking)

34:41.667 --> 34:44.200
UM...

34:46.500 --> 34:48.600
I AM PRESTON BURKE,

34:48.633 --> 34:51.500
A WIDELY-RENOWNED
CARDIOTHORACIC SURGEON.

34:51.533 --> 34:56.200
I AM... A PROFESSIONAL.

34:56.233 --> 34:59.100
AND MORE THAN THAT,
I AM A GOOD AND KIND PERSON.

34:59.133 --> 35:01.767
I AM PERSON THAT CLEANS UP
BEHIND MYSELF.

35:01.800 --> 35:03.700
I AM A PERSON THAT COOKS WELL.

35:03.733 --> 35:07.100
AND YOU--YOU ARE
AN UNBELIEVABLE SLOB.

35:07.133 --> 35:10.067
A SLOVENLY, ANGRY INTERN.

35:11.100 --> 35:12.833
AND YOU--YOU ARE
THE MOST COMPETITIVE,

35:12.867 --> 35:16.200
MOST GUARDED, MOST STUBBORN
MOST CHALLENGING PERSON

35:16.233 --> 35:18.633
I HAVE EVER MET.

35:18.667 --> 35:21.833
AND I LOVE YOU.

35:21.867 --> 35:24.433
(clock ticks)

35:24.467 --> 35:26.367
WHAT THE HELL
IS THE MATTER WITH YOU

35:26.400 --> 35:29.333
THAT YOU WON'T JUST LET ME?

35:31.167 --> 35:35.067
I GAVE UP MY APARTMENT
20 MINUTES AGO.

35:36.867 --> 35:39.233
WELL, ALL RIGHT, THEN.

35:39.267 --> 35:41.533
***

35:41.567 --> 35:44.200
I'VE HEARD THAT IT'S POSSIBLE
TO GROW UP.

35:44.233 --> 35:46.333
***

35:46.367 --> 35:49.267
I'VE JUST NEVER MET ANYONE
WHO'S ACTUALLY DONE IT.

35:49.300 --> 35:51.167
DR. STEVENS,
AFTER THE SURGERY,

35:51.200 --> 35:53.100
WILL I STILL BE ABLE TO--

35:53.133 --> 35:55.833
WHEN I WANT TO, WILL I
STILL BE ABLE TO HAVE...

35:55.867 --> 35:59.767
YOU KNOW...
(whispers) EPISODES?

36:02.700 --> 36:05.300
EVEN BETTER, PAMELA...

36:05.333 --> 36:07.567
(whispers)
YOU'LL BE ABLE TO HAVE ORGASMS.

36:07.600 --> 36:09.433
***

36:09.467 --> 36:11.400
WITHOUT PARENTS TO DEFY,

36:11.433 --> 36:14.800
WE BREAK THE RULES
WE MAKE FOR OURSELVES...

36:14.833 --> 36:18.267
***

36:20.100 --> 36:24.467
WE THROW TANTRUMS
WHEN THINGS DON'T GO OUR WAY...

36:24.500 --> 36:26.167
HEY.

36:26.200 --> 36:28.467
SHE DOESN'T HEAR ME.

36:29.667 --> 36:30.433
WHAT?

36:30.467 --> 36:33.300
SHE DOESN'T EVEN HEAR ME
WHEN I TALK.

36:35.433 --> 36:37.333
SHE WILL IF YOU MAKE HER.

36:37.367 --> 36:40.367
***

36:42.067 --> 36:44.800
YOU FED THE BEAST,
DIDN'T YOU?

36:46.433 --> 36:48.067
TWICE.

36:51.467 --> 36:54.333
***

36:54.367 --> 36:56.367
(laughs)
I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

36:56.400 --> 36:59.067
BYE.

37:03.300 --> 37:06.833
WE WHISPER SECRETS WITH
OUR FRIENDS IN THE DARK...

37:06.867 --> 37:09.533
***

37:09.567 --> 37:11.467
MEREDITH CAME TO SEE ME
TODAY.

37:11.500 --> 37:14.300
HMM. POOR BABY.

37:14.333 --> 37:16.200
POOR THING.

37:16.233 --> 37:19.400
HER FATHER LEFT, YOU KNOW?

37:21.067 --> 37:22.800
I THINK SHE KNOWS
ABOUT US, ELLIS.

37:22.833 --> 37:25.600
I THINK SHE'S
FIGURED IT OUT.

37:25.633 --> 37:28.733
SHE'S 5 YEARS OLD,
RICHARD. (laughs)

37:28.767 --> 37:33.633
WE LOOK FOR COMFORT
WHERE WE CAN FIND IT...

37:33.667 --> 37:36.767
***

37:36.800 --> 37:40.533
THIS SEAT TAKEN?

37:40.567 --> 37:42.367
I GUESS NOT.

37:42.400 --> 37:43.567
DOUBLE SCOTCH,

37:43.600 --> 37:45.267
SINGLE MALT.

37:45.300 --> 37:48.333
***

37:48.367 --> 37:51.400
YOU LOOK SAD.

37:57.800 --> 38:01.333
I JUST SAW MY FATHER
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 20 YEARS.

38:01.367 --> 38:03.233
HOW'D THAT GO?

38:03.267 --> 38:05.233
IT COULDA GONE BETTER.

38:05.267 --> 38:08.500
***

38:08.533 --> 38:11.400
WHAT ARE YOU
STILL DOING HERE?

38:14.667 --> 38:17.667
I'M HOPING ADDISON
SHOWS UP.

38:19.167 --> 38:21.700
YOU'RE STILL IN LOVE
WITH HER?

38:21.733 --> 38:23.767
YOU'RE STILL IN LOVE
WITH HIM.

38:23.800 --> 38:27.300
***

38:27.333 --> 38:29.400
SHE WON'T SHOW, YOU KNOW?

38:29.433 --> 38:32.133
NO?

38:32.167 --> 38:35.067
HE'S NOT THE KIND OF GUY
YOU LEAVE IF YOU CAN HELP IT.

38:35.067 --> 38:37.700
(sighs)

38:37.733 --> 38:41.267
WHAT IF YOU'RE WRONG?

38:41.300 --> 38:44.800
WHAT IF, JUST THIS ONCE,

38:44.833 --> 38:48.767
LIFE COMES DOWN ON THE SIDE
OF THE DIRTY MISTRESSES?

38:48.800 --> 38:52.500
AND WE HOPE--
AGAINST ALL LOGIC,

38:52.533 --> 38:56.333
AGAINST ALL EXPERIENCE.

38:56.367 --> 38:59.367
***

39:07.167 --> 39:09.767
LIKE CHILDREN...

39:09.800 --> 39:13.267
WE NEVER GIVE UP HOPE.

39:13.300 --> 39:14.600
(knock on door)

39:14.633 --> 39:17.467
(sighs)

39:17.500 --> 39:19.467
COME IN.

39:19.500 --> 39:22.500
***

39:35.533 --> 39:38.633
I KNOW I'M NOT
A WORLD-RENOWNED SURGEON.

39:38.667 --> 39:40.633
AND I KNOW I'M NOT
A LOT OF THINGS

39:40.667 --> 39:44.533
THAT YOU'VE GONE FOR
IN THE PAST.

39:44.567 --> 39:47.067
I KNOW.

39:48.400 --> 39:50.733
BUT...

39:50.767 --> 39:53.233
I WOULD NEVER LEAVE YOU.

39:55.867 --> 39:58.133
I WOULD NEVER HURT YOU.

40:02.667 --> 40:05.733
AND I WILL NEVER
STOP LOVING YOU.
