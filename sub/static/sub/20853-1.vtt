02:27.978 --> 02:30.937
It's pretty good, though.
Come back here. Oh, come on.

02:31.885 --> 02:34.113
- Yeah, yeah.
- Sam, you get the blanket.

02:34.213 --> 02:36.415
Okay. Sorry.

02:36.515 --> 02:38.327
Catch it, AJ!

02:38.755 --> 02:40.601
Come on, kid.

03:02.411 --> 03:06.049
Maybe we should go help Mom, huh?
Come on, come on.

03:06.149 --> 03:07.951
Come on!

03:08.051 --> 03:10.287
You go back and get the blanket
so Mom doesn't kill me.

03:10.387 --> 03:11.922
Yeah.

03:22.631 --> 03:24.434
Did you see my wife?

03:25.501 --> 03:27.470
No, sorry.

03:27.570 --> 03:29.072
Nancy!

03:33.575 --> 03:35.111
Nancy!

03:42.484 --> 03:44.020
Nancy!

03:47.857 --> 03:49.392
Nancy!

03:53.028 --> 03:54.598
Nancy!

04:14.050 --> 04:17.156
It's beautiful, isn't it?
More secluded than I thought.

04:17.257 --> 04:18.788
It was sunny 10 minutes ago.

04:18.887 --> 04:21.057
I love it. This is exactly
what I've been looking for.

04:21.156 --> 04:23.571
Mr. Lopez, I'm sorry to show up
like this. I tried to call you.

04:23.671 --> 04:26.830
The reception here is...
but I'm sure it's just my phone.

04:26.930 --> 04:29.377
Is it okay if I show
Mr. and Mrs. Owen around?

04:29.477 --> 04:32.906
- Nice to meet you. Paul. Hey.
- Nice to meet you.

04:33.006 --> 04:36.293
Sure, look around. I can't stay,
I'm afraid. I was on my way out.

04:36.393 --> 04:39.209
Oh, no, that's okay.
It's probably better if you're not here.

04:39.309 --> 04:43.079
Hey, listen. The house is a real mess,
especially the kitchen.

04:43.179 --> 04:46.182
Oh, I'll take care of it.
I'll tell them you had guests.

04:46.282 --> 04:49.507
- Yes, really messy guests.
- Don't worry.

04:50.719 --> 04:53.391
Can we meet for a late lunch this afternoon?

04:54.891 --> 04:57.827
Just to talk about the house
and some other stuff.

04:57.927 --> 05:00.547
- Yeah, of course.
- Alright, Brent's two o'clock?

05:00.647 --> 05:02.599
- Sure. Good.
- Good, good. All right.

05:02.699 --> 05:04.534
- See you then. Okay.
- Cool.

05:04.634 --> 05:08.072
- Hope you like what you see.
- Come on, I'll show you inside.

06:54.076 --> 06:57.447
To recap our top story, police
have confirmed that a young woman...

06:57.547 --> 06:59.955
...has been murdered in Jefferson County.

07:00.055 --> 07:02.786
This is the fourth
young woman in three years.

07:02.886 --> 07:06.088
In other news, the Rockies
lost another close one...

07:06.188 --> 07:10.258
...as the Mets came to town
and annihilated them.

07:11.427 --> 07:13.062
Hey, Pat.

07:13.162 --> 07:14.697
Hey, Paul.

07:14.797 --> 07:18.668
Hey, do you know they pay $36,000
a year to house one convict?

07:18.768 --> 07:22.905
Yeah, read it in the paper.
School teachers make less.

07:23.005 --> 07:26.209
- Bring your list?
- Yeah.

07:26.725 --> 07:29.462
A few additions. There you go.

07:30.846 --> 07:32.716
You gonna square up?

07:33.616 --> 07:36.686
I'll give it to Hank on delivery, Wednesday.

07:36.786 --> 07:38.388
Is that all right with you?

07:38.488 --> 07:41.491
- Go hunting today?
- Just got back.

07:41.591 --> 07:45.328
- Get lucky?
- Yeah. I got a goose.

07:45.428 --> 07:47.263
Nice one.

07:55.904 --> 07:58.744
- Hey, Marty?
- Hey, Paul, what's going on?

07:58.844 --> 08:01.978
Did you get my messages?
I've been clogging up your voicemail.

08:02.078 --> 08:06.149
Reception sucks in here, man.
So, listen, did you get the script?

08:06.249 --> 08:09.619
Yeah. I sent it back to you
already with my comments.

08:09.719 --> 08:13.489
You sent it back?
I thought we were rolling out with it.

08:13.589 --> 08:15.592
You didn't incorporate any of their notes.

08:15.692 --> 08:19.028
If I sent it back as is, they'd never
read anything of yours ever again.

08:19.128 --> 08:22.699
You understand that, Paul?
Once in a while, you gotta compromise...

08:22.799 --> 08:26.102
- ...show that you're functional.
- I am.

08:26.202 --> 08:29.839
Not within the system, you're not. Look,
we both know you need the money, right?

08:29.939 --> 08:34.210
Well, yes, I need the money,
but not at any cost, you know?

08:34.309 --> 08:38.089
Good line, but I thought
you had bills to pay. Exactly.

08:38.188 --> 08:42.952
Look, just pull yourself together.
Okay, I gotta go. Bye.

08:43.186 --> 08:45.655
Marty. Marty?

08:48.558 --> 08:50.126
Fucker.

09:03.239 --> 09:05.356
What the fuck is going on with this guy?

09:15.250 --> 09:16.953
Come on!

09:21.991 --> 09:23.793
Jesus Christ.

09:28.765 --> 09:30.567
What the fuck, man?

09:54.189 --> 09:57.512
...confirm Nancy Barrows,
46, of Greenville, Colorado...

09:57.612 --> 10:00.122
...is the fourth victim
of the roadside killer.

10:00.222 --> 10:01.798
- Okay.
- Hey, Paul, what's up?

10:01.998 --> 10:05.210
- Okay, thanks, I'll be there.
- Wanna sit at the counter?

10:06.236 --> 10:08.705
- Mr. Lopez.
- Laura. I'm sorry I'm late.

10:08.805 --> 10:10.373
- No, it's okay.
- All right.

10:10.473 --> 10:13.076
So, the Owens aren't interested.

10:14.544 --> 10:17.463
- You still wanna buy me lunch?
- Of course.

10:17.713 --> 10:20.617
It's my way of keeping you motivated.

10:21.617 --> 10:24.720
Actually, I can only stay a few minutes.
I had to commit to another appointment.

10:24.820 --> 10:26.689
If you'd been here
just five minutes earlier...

10:26.789 --> 10:29.459
- Not even a cup of coffee?
- Already had one.

10:29.559 --> 10:32.108
- Just coffee.
- Judy.

10:34.863 --> 10:36.232
Thank you.

10:36.332 --> 10:40.503
I have to admit I'm a bit in awe.
I've never known a writer before.

10:40.603 --> 10:42.472
Well, don't be.

10:43.205 --> 10:45.428
I don't know any either.

10:45.928 --> 10:49.645
- Why do you say that?
- I haven't written in a long time.

10:49.745 --> 10:52.448
Nothing good, anyway.
You know, can't get it started.

10:52.548 --> 10:54.317
How long?

10:54.417 --> 10:58.302
Two years, more.
It's embarrassing. But listen...

10:59.602 --> 11:03.759
...let's talk about real estate
and selling my house instead.

11:03.859 --> 11:09.089
The Owens are not interested,
so, what is the next step?

11:09.931 --> 11:13.619
I'm not sure. Wait.
I'm not supposed to say that.

11:13.719 --> 11:15.578
No, no, you're just being honest.

11:15.678 --> 11:20.243
Yeah, I haven't been doing this
very long. Can you tell?

11:20.943 --> 11:22.979
Actually, you're my first.

11:24.379 --> 11:27.836
- Your first, what?
- My first victim.

11:28.933 --> 11:31.788
That's okay. I don't mind.

11:31.888 --> 11:33.914
No, it's not okay.

11:34.791 --> 11:37.032
I'm sure I can get another
appointment in a couple weeks.

11:37.132 --> 11:40.028
- How long can you hold out?
- Couple of weeks.

11:40.796 --> 11:43.566
So do you think it's gonna take a long time?

11:43.666 --> 11:46.869
Well, it depends. I mean, this time
of year, there's hardly anybody in town.

11:46.969 --> 11:49.660
- I mean, in the summer is better.
- Summer?

11:49.760 --> 11:53.444
- Well, with the tourists and...
- That was you back there, right?

11:56.912 --> 12:00.149
- What? You know that guy?
- Hey, hey, hey.

12:00.249 --> 12:03.653
Listen. Listen. Something happened
on my way over here.

12:03.753 --> 12:06.943
It was just a bad driver. Just forget it.

12:07.423 --> 12:08.991
Anyway...

12:09.817 --> 12:14.086
...I thought we would have, you know,
an easier time selling the house...

12:14.186 --> 12:17.767
- ...being close to Denver...
- Your house needs a little fixing up...

12:17.867 --> 12:20.069
...and, secondly,
it's not that close to Denver.

12:20.169 --> 12:23.173
I mean, it's a two-hour drive
just to hit the suburbs.

12:24.839 --> 12:26.809
Have dinner with me.

12:26.909 --> 12:29.863
- Mr. Lopez, I...
- No, no, no. It's...

12:29.963 --> 12:34.150
...Pablo, actually. But I like Paul better.

12:34.250 --> 12:35.819
Listen...

12:36.319 --> 12:41.191
...we have seen each other,
what, three times now?

12:41.991 --> 12:44.708
But every single time, it's bad news.

12:47.262 --> 12:49.131
I can't tonight.

12:50.399 --> 12:52.452
But how about Saturday?

12:54.302 --> 12:57.039
- Great.
- Okay.

12:57.139 --> 12:58.240
Eight o'clock?

12:58.340 --> 12:59.903
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Good.

13:00.003 --> 13:01.577
Okay.

13:03.612 --> 13:06.482
- Bye, Paul.
- Bye.

13:11.753 --> 13:15.024
- Judy.
- Yeah? Coming.

13:15.424 --> 13:17.614
That was a real smart move back there.

13:20.616 --> 13:23.866
I shouldn't have done that. I know, yeah.

13:24.466 --> 13:28.432
You know, I used to meet a friend of mine
in places like this until an asshole...

13:28.532 --> 13:30.012
...like you ran him off the road!

13:30.112 --> 13:32.280
Hey! Can you keep it down?
I'm trying to watch...

13:32.380 --> 13:35.823
- Fuck off!
- I'm sorry. Just drop it now.

13:35.923 --> 13:39.181
- I won't just drop it!
- Hey, that's it!

13:54.495 --> 13:57.133
Everything's okay, guys, don't worry.

14:00.136 --> 14:01.937
Hey, I don't know how to thank you.

14:05.273 --> 14:07.477
I'm sorry, Judy. I...

14:07.777 --> 14:09.897
- I'm sorry.
- It happens.

14:09.997 --> 14:13.215
- Give me that.
- No, it's fine, really.

14:15.784 --> 14:18.654
He was an idiot. Jesus.

14:21.623 --> 14:25.095
- Sorry, man. Really sorry.
- No worries.

15:03.498 --> 15:05.300
Thank you.

15:06.067 --> 15:07.737
Where are you going?

15:07.837 --> 15:10.085
Just drop me wherever suits you.

15:17.478 --> 15:19.348
I'm Paul.

15:20.415 --> 15:21.917
Jack.

15:26.321 --> 15:28.190
You hunt?

15:28.490 --> 15:30.860
Yeah, I got a goose this morning, yeah.

15:43.204 --> 15:46.008
- What do you do?
- I'm a writer.

15:46.108 --> 15:47.409
- Really?
- Yeah.

15:47.509 --> 15:48.827
Books?

15:48.927 --> 15:51.392
Yeah, books, yeah, long time ago.

15:53.615 --> 15:55.484
Must be hard work.

16:00.054 --> 16:01.609
Listen...

16:02.245 --> 16:04.210
- ...can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

16:04.327 --> 16:08.019
In the fight back there,
what did you say to that guy?

16:08.597 --> 16:11.868
- What did I say?
- Yeah, the man was terrified.

16:13.770 --> 16:15.838
I told him I liked my lunch quiet.

16:32.487 --> 16:34.758
So you gonna tell me where you're going?

16:35.958 --> 16:37.827
Just enjoying the road.

16:40.428 --> 16:42.232
You like living like that?

16:43.232 --> 16:45.034
Nothing better.

16:46.601 --> 16:48.404
How do you get by?

16:48.904 --> 16:50.773
I do what I have to do.

16:51.173 --> 16:52.975
Then I move on.

16:53.741 --> 16:55.611
Nothing you miss?

16:57.612 --> 17:00.283
You know, hot shower.

17:03.351 --> 17:05.220
Some storm?

17:07.422 --> 17:09.290
Pretty bad.

17:09.691 --> 17:12.328
Took out power and telephone lines.

17:12.627 --> 17:14.664
Power only just came back.

17:19.800 --> 17:21.387
Listen...

17:22.871 --> 17:25.406
I... I don't wanna drop you on the road...

17:25.507 --> 17:27.675
...with this weather coming out there.

17:27.776 --> 17:30.880
The weather, man. They always get it wrong.

17:30.980 --> 17:35.017
Well, we are close to my place,
and I got a guest room.

17:35.117 --> 17:37.219
You can use it for the night,
have a hot shower.

17:37.319 --> 17:40.742
Look, don't feel like you owe me, okay?

17:41.857 --> 17:43.525
It's the least I can do.

17:43.625 --> 17:46.705
I would be at the hospital
without you back there.

17:49.230 --> 17:51.033
Appreciate it.

18:34.676 --> 18:36.478
Here we are.

18:36.678 --> 18:39.782
- You like it?
- Yeah, I like it.

18:39.882 --> 18:41.417
Good.

18:44.085 --> 18:46.042
You must have sold a lot of books.

18:46.722 --> 18:50.192
- I did all right.
- Hey, let me help you.

18:50.292 --> 18:52.127
Take that bag.

18:56.414 --> 18:58.899
- Nice kill.
- Well...

18:58.999 --> 19:01.854
...I can be a good shot
if I do say so myself.

19:18.218 --> 19:20.883
It is messed up. You gotta be careful.

19:23.357 --> 19:24.794
There.

19:27.930 --> 19:29.765
All right.

19:33.701 --> 19:35.990
Sorry, maid's day off.

19:37.872 --> 19:39.708
You have a maid?

19:41.188 --> 19:42.744
No.

19:43.177 --> 19:45.046
Not anymore.

19:45.580 --> 19:47.850
Probably working for my ex.

19:48.450 --> 19:50.286
Is that a joke?

20:04.165 --> 20:07.789
Let me show you to your room. Fuck. Hang on.

20:08.303 --> 20:13.365
Watch your step. My wife made me
put these safety bolts on all windows.

20:13.465 --> 20:15.867
- She was scared, you know.
- Of what?

20:15.967 --> 20:18.780
I don't know. Isolation?

20:21.049 --> 20:23.685
All right. Here we are.

20:25.319 --> 20:27.689
Bathroom is over there, and it has a shower.

20:27.789 --> 20:30.426
Sheets and towels in the closet.

20:31.126 --> 20:34.529
- Thanks, Paul.
- Yeah, make yourself comfortable.

21:27.565 --> 21:29.502
You have cleaned up.

21:29.852 --> 21:31.686
You hungry?

23:00.208 --> 23:02.745
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

23:02.845 --> 23:07.095
- The water is freezing.
- Yeah, it is. Makes you feel alive.

23:07.545 --> 23:09.768
Could just pinch yourself.

23:10.786 --> 23:12.421
Thanks for breakfast.

23:15.356 --> 23:18.026
I noticed that this door
has to be completely reframed.

23:18.126 --> 23:21.948
Now, I found a few spare planks outside,
but I'm gonna be able to fix that...

23:22.048 --> 23:24.303
- ...before I leave this afternoon.
- No, no, no, no.

23:24.403 --> 23:26.668
You don't have to fix anything.

23:26.768 --> 23:29.571
- Paul, I want to.
- I'm moving.

23:29.671 --> 23:31.840
I need to sell this place.

23:31.940 --> 23:34.276
Why would you give all this up?

23:34.376 --> 23:39.217
Because I can't afford to stay.
You know, can't sell any of my work.

23:39.648 --> 23:42.251
Besides, there's nothing left for me here.

23:42.951 --> 23:44.786
Not without my wife.

23:47.855 --> 23:49.342
I can help you.

23:50.492 --> 23:51.471
No.

23:51.571 --> 23:56.238
No, really. I mean, it's not that much work.
I could have it done in maybe three days.

23:56.338 --> 23:59.241
- Jack. Jack, I can't pay you.
- Perhaps a little bit longer.

23:59.801 --> 24:02.671
- Come on.
- Don't worry about it.

24:08.943 --> 24:11.610
I'll do the cooking, deal?

26:03.257 --> 26:05.060
Your wife?

26:10.564 --> 26:13.034
It's the last picture of her...

26:13.134 --> 26:15.950
...before she left me.

26:21.542 --> 26:23.979
You know, I should clean
this place up too, right?

26:24.079 --> 26:27.726
No, no. I like it like this. Thank you.

26:30.484 --> 26:32.354
You write these?

26:44.965 --> 26:47.873
- El Ãºltimo hombre.
- Yeah, the last man.

26:52.573 --> 26:53.909
Right.

26:57.045 --> 27:00.415
Phone is still not working. No Internet.

27:01.067 --> 27:02.951
Fuck it.

27:04.318 --> 27:07.156
- Yeah.
- You don't need 'em.

27:08.055 --> 27:09.458
Yeah.

27:09.558 --> 27:13.779
Anyway, I thought a writer would actually
appreciate being cut off from the world.

27:14.429 --> 27:17.498
You know? The seclusion.

27:18.132 --> 27:20.602
Be able to get some work done,
no distractions.

27:20.702 --> 27:24.540
Well, the irony is that we are
always looking for a distraction.

27:25.240 --> 27:29.277
Procrastination, writers thrive on it.

27:29.377 --> 27:32.214
This stew is excellent.

27:32.614 --> 27:34.449
Thank you.

27:36.183 --> 27:37.749
So...

27:38.381 --> 27:40.689
...tomorrow I'm gonna start working the shed.

27:40.789 --> 27:44.139
Needs a new coat of paint. And there's
some tiles on your roof that need fixing.

27:44.239 --> 27:47.265
You'll never have time to do
all that in three days, Jack.

27:48.763 --> 27:52.401
I said it might take
a little bit longer, didn't I?

27:52.501 --> 27:54.003
Right.

27:54.703 --> 27:58.138
I don't mean to pry, but...
don't you writers make a good living?

27:59.858 --> 28:02.094
Well, that depends on the writer.

28:02.194 --> 28:04.056
What kind of writer are you?

28:05.514 --> 28:09.751
I had my first novel published when I was 25.

28:09.851 --> 28:13.388
My first bestseller before I turned 30...

28:13.488 --> 28:16.157
...and critics really liked me.

28:16.257 --> 28:19.928
They liked me a lot, so you know,
the word got around...

28:20.028 --> 28:23.097
...and suddenly, well,
this American literary agent...

28:23.197 --> 28:28.235
...flew out to meet me in Madrid, and he
said that the studios were interested...

28:28.335 --> 28:31.239
...to adapt, some of my books to the screen.

28:31.339 --> 28:34.176
And so, for all my sins...

28:35.843 --> 28:38.914
...I signed with him.
So he sold the book, and...

28:39.014 --> 28:41.650
...they got me to write the screenplay...

28:41.750 --> 28:44.590
...and suddenly out of the blue...

28:44.690 --> 28:48.757
...you know, they forgot
the agreement, entirely.

28:48.857 --> 28:50.926
And they gave it to somebody else to write.

28:51.026 --> 28:53.496
So they kicked you out of your own movie?

28:56.330 --> 29:00.970
- Can't get any worse than that, I guess.
- Oh, yes, it can. It can.

29:01.970 --> 29:05.796
The worst part is that
they did make the movie...

29:06.408 --> 29:10.677
...and the only thing left
of my book was the title.

29:12.212 --> 29:13.748
Yep.

29:16.216 --> 29:19.421
I married the woman of my dreams,
I had money...

29:20.101 --> 29:23.565
...an apartment in the Wilshire Corridor,
you know, tons of needy friends...

29:23.665 --> 29:25.961
...and it all went away.

29:29.496 --> 29:31.332
Even the woman.

29:36.738 --> 29:38.625
We're all free men.

29:39.202 --> 29:41.011
We choose what we want.

29:42.210 --> 29:45.881
- You did this to yourself.
- Well, no, all I choose was this place.

29:45.981 --> 29:49.567
I told my wife it would help,
you know, I needed isolation...

29:49.667 --> 29:52.923
...to write and that was my sacrifice!

29:55.022 --> 29:58.917
All writing is sacrifice.

30:05.633 --> 30:08.369
You know, in most movies I see...

30:08.469 --> 30:12.230
...the characters are just what they are,
characters in a movie.

30:12.330 --> 30:16.178
Nothing seems real.
Nothing is like how life really is.

30:17.711 --> 30:19.581
I don't disagree.

30:19.781 --> 30:22.051
Maybe it's just 'cause I travel a lot.

30:22.701 --> 30:26.071
You know, I watch what's going on around me.

30:26.421 --> 30:28.223
I watch people.

30:28.989 --> 30:30.826
I'm not a recluse.

30:31.426 --> 30:33.294
Must be it.

30:33.927 --> 30:35.730
You know...

30:37.297 --> 30:40.235
...I'd really like to read
one of your scripts.

30:40.335 --> 30:42.404
If that wouldn't be a problem.

30:45.906 --> 30:47.542
Okay.

30:47.642 --> 30:50.045
- Yeah?
- Yeah, I'll...

30:54.615 --> 30:56.295
All right...

30:56.395 --> 30:58.633
...this is the last one I wrote.

30:58.733 --> 31:01.723
My hail Mary pass to get something sold.

31:01.823 --> 31:03.658
Nobody wants it.

31:04.725 --> 31:06.552
My agent says it's crap.

31:07.429 --> 31:09.265
Under the Clock.

31:10.864 --> 31:12.200
Yeah.

31:12.300 --> 31:16.205
- I think I've heard this title before.
- Even the title, then.

31:18.465 --> 31:20.008
Yeah.

31:21.191 --> 31:22.994
I'll tell you what.

31:23.544 --> 31:26.181
I'll give you the opinion of the common man.

31:26.411 --> 31:30.436
- It's gotta count for something, right?
- It counts for more than my agent's.

31:31.586 --> 31:34.055
Yeah, yes, enjoy it, man.

31:55.342 --> 31:57.118
Good afternoon.

31:58.579 --> 32:00.381
How was your nap?

32:01.148 --> 32:03.751
Not good. Not good.

32:08.856 --> 32:10.883
Delias Kristianiae.

32:11.760 --> 32:15.463
Black Butterfly, from Indonesia.

32:15.563 --> 32:17.332
Very rare.

32:17.432 --> 32:19.301
Very hard to catch.

32:19.701 --> 32:23.175
- Ironic, really.
- Ironic?

32:23.604 --> 32:26.474
Yeah, I had it done in prison.

32:42.990 --> 32:44.826
You looking for these?

32:45.326 --> 32:47.980
I needed to work on the shed,
I had to unlock it.

32:49.731 --> 32:51.600
You gonna work today?

32:52.100 --> 32:53.626
No.

32:54.199 --> 32:58.343
I'm not in the right frame of mind,
and I have to sell this house.

32:59.340 --> 33:01.977
Hard to work when you
got to worry about money.

33:05.012 --> 33:07.239
You know you have to do yourself a favor.

33:08.918 --> 33:10.551
What is that?

33:10.651 --> 33:12.487
You know...

33:13.454 --> 33:15.690
...you have to stop drinking.

33:15.790 --> 33:18.027
I mean, you gotta stop it cold.

33:20.228 --> 33:22.297
You could be a great writer.

33:22.697 --> 33:27.103
But your stories are not good enough,
and it's because of your drinking.

33:29.737 --> 33:34.343
You know, I think you just need
a good idea to jumpstart your career.

33:35.243 --> 33:37.779
You know, I was thinking
this morning, I got an idea.

33:37.879 --> 33:39.881
- Of course you do.
- No, really.

33:39.981 --> 33:42.183
I mean, I want you to hear it.
All right, look...

33:42.283 --> 33:44.986
...I know it'd be like God taking
advice from a lowly priest.

33:45.186 --> 33:48.023
I am listening, yes. All right.

33:48.123 --> 33:49.658
Okay.

33:50.158 --> 33:51.960
You tell our story.

33:54.529 --> 33:57.599
- What story?
- Our story.

33:57.699 --> 33:59.701
Okay, it goes like this.

34:00.101 --> 34:02.923
A writer travels to the U.S....

34:03.023 --> 34:08.070
...looking for inspiration, gets himself
a beautiful house in a remote area.

34:08.810 --> 34:10.315
And so...

34:11.045 --> 34:13.540
He's had some success...

34:13.976 --> 34:15.483
...short-lived.

34:15.583 --> 34:17.882
He can't write anymore, so...

34:17.982 --> 34:19.463
...he drinks.

34:19.721 --> 34:21.790
He's become an alcoholic.

34:22.190 --> 34:25.212
And he lives like a recluse
to hide his decline.

34:26.694 --> 34:30.431
So, this writer goes into a diner.

34:30.531 --> 34:33.467
He's got a... a date with a pretty girl.

34:33.568 --> 34:36.404
But today is not gonna be his lucky day.

34:36.504 --> 34:39.572
He gets into it with some pissed off
truck driver looking for trouble...

34:39.672 --> 34:44.092
...who frightens off the girl and then
gets into a fight with the writer.

34:45.213 --> 34:48.149
So for sure, this writer's
gonna get his ass kicked.

34:48.248 --> 34:52.420
But then a stranger intervenes
and... helps him out.

34:52.719 --> 34:56.190
So the writer is driving home,
still a little shaken...

34:56.290 --> 34:59.445
...and he sees this stranger
walking along the road, so, naturally...

34:59.545 --> 35:02.030
...he pulls over and gives the guy a lift.

35:02.730 --> 35:04.499
The writer and the stranger start talking...

35:04.599 --> 35:09.070
...and the writer offers the stranger
some work 'cause he feels sorry for him.

35:09.170 --> 35:12.140
But even then, he's kinda concerned
'cause he doesn't know who this guy is.

35:12.240 --> 35:14.475
I mean, he could be anybody.

35:14.575 --> 35:17.412
So by the time they get to the house...

35:17.512 --> 35:21.516
- ...the writer's already beginning to regret...
- No, no, no. It's not like this.

35:21.616 --> 35:23.151
Paul.

35:24.117 --> 35:25.920
It's just a story.

35:26.820 --> 35:28.356
Yeah.

35:30.190 --> 35:32.994
It's a good start. Go on.

35:33.094 --> 35:36.597
You're the writer, man. You write it.

35:36.697 --> 35:38.550
But you gotta be committed.

35:43.771 --> 35:45.540
Okay, sure, yeah.

35:46.440 --> 35:48.520
When do you think you'll be done?

36:40.994 --> 36:43.198
Who said you could read the script?

36:43.698 --> 36:45.166
Why not?

36:45.366 --> 36:48.202
Because I'm still working on it.
You can't read this.

36:48.302 --> 36:51.739
It's called a work in progress, you know?

36:52.139 --> 36:54.009
That's not the problem.

36:55.009 --> 36:56.831
This story...

36:57.395 --> 37:00.152
...the way it happens, it's too easy.

37:00.252 --> 37:03.527
Too easy? It's exactly what happened.

37:03.627 --> 37:05.185
Really?

37:05.685 --> 37:07.489
Are you sure about that?

37:08.905 --> 37:12.977
The Jack you write about, he's just some
guy standing at the counter of a diner.

37:13.661 --> 37:15.925
But what do we really know about him?

37:16.797 --> 37:18.667
What do we know?

37:19.067 --> 37:20.868
You know, maybe...

37:20.968 --> 37:24.574
...you know, maybe he was partnered up
with the truck driver who barged in.

37:27.574 --> 37:31.606
Maybe they worked it out in advance,
Jack and the truck driver.

37:32.446 --> 37:36.285
You know, they said, "when this guy
comes in, you start a fight with him.

37:37.435 --> 37:41.852
Then I'll come in, save his ass,
and he'll be eternally grateful."

37:42.323 --> 37:46.680
And later, in the parking lot,
what Jack whispers in his ear, is...

37:47.642 --> 37:51.266
"thanks, buddy. Now he's mine."

37:52.266 --> 37:54.903
Then Jack takes off down the road.

37:55.383 --> 37:58.873
And then later the writer's driving home,
so what does he do?

37:59.473 --> 38:01.876
I mean, he wants to be a nice guy,
so he offers him work...

38:01.976 --> 38:06.014
So if... if Jack had some kind of...

38:06.604 --> 38:09.083
...relationship
with the truck driver, that...

38:09.183 --> 38:11.552
...that would be very interesting.

38:11.652 --> 38:14.696
- I mean... you're the writer, right?
- Yeah.

38:14.796 --> 38:18.169
Maybe the truck driver
should come back into the story...

38:18.269 --> 38:19.798
...towards the end.

38:25.599 --> 38:27.854
I have a better ending in mind.

38:45.086 --> 38:47.556
Hard to speak a single word, isn't it?

38:51.024 --> 38:53.228
That's where your script fails.

38:57.465 --> 38:59.515
That was the only way to show you.

39:04.137 --> 39:06.541
The woman on the run in your script...

39:06.941 --> 39:09.363
...she's about to have her throat slit.

39:09.463 --> 39:12.326
- What the fuck?
- And you have her pleading with him.

39:13.914 --> 39:16.400
If she reacted like you just did...

39:16.784 --> 39:19.047
...that would be realistic.

39:19.287 --> 39:21.561
I just wanted to show you some real.

39:23.791 --> 39:25.593
Sorry for the scare.

41:59.847 --> 42:01.349
Jack!

42:18.865 --> 42:20.401
Jack!

42:42.121 --> 42:43.925
What's up?

42:44.125 --> 42:46.093
Did you hear that scream?

42:46.193 --> 42:48.596
- Scream?
- Just now.

42:48.696 --> 42:51.599
- You didn't hear it?
- No.

42:51.699 --> 42:54.085
It was a woman's scream.
I heard it from inside.

42:54.185 --> 42:56.070
You didn't hear it?

43:00.208 --> 43:02.042
You mean that?

43:42.186 --> 43:43.751
Nah.

43:58.131 --> 44:00.000
You expecting somebody?

44:06.339 --> 44:08.113
It's the grocery store.

44:08.213 --> 44:11.412
I got a standing order.
They deliver every week.

44:12.545 --> 44:15.216
Paul, not too far.

44:15.866 --> 44:17.765
What are you doing?

44:17.865 --> 44:20.489
He's a fucking delivery man. Put it down!

44:21.389 --> 44:23.257
- Hi.
- Oh, hey, Mr. Lopez.

44:23.357 --> 44:25.659
- Hank's not working today?
- No, not today.

44:25.759 --> 44:27.561
- Here's your delivery.
- Yeah.

44:27.661 --> 44:30.306
By the way, Mr. Lopez, Pat mentioned
you may have a check for him.

44:30.406 --> 44:33.501
I can't pay you today.
You know, and I told Pat that.

44:33.601 --> 44:36.136
Yeah, he also said
a postdated check would be fine.

44:36.236 --> 44:39.106
I don't have that for you today. I'm sorry.

44:39.206 --> 44:42.042
Well, I don't really wanna
get in trouble my first day.

44:42.142 --> 44:46.781
You won't. I know Pat a long time.
It's... you're gonna be fine, all right?

44:46.881 --> 44:50.194
Just leave it there... good. Thank you.

44:50.294 --> 44:53.053
- Okay, bye.
- All right. Okay, bye.

45:04.664 --> 45:06.167
Paul.

45:07.700 --> 45:09.571
Where are you going?

45:10.371 --> 45:12.029
We had an agreement.

45:12.129 --> 45:14.133
- Now you're breaking it.
- An agreement?

45:14.233 --> 45:17.845
You had a gun on me, a gun, Jack!

45:17.945 --> 45:21.449
I don't know what your
fucking game is, not anymore.

45:29.922 --> 45:32.393
- Listen to me.
- No, you listen to me!

45:32.493 --> 45:36.446
You point a gun at me, just because
someone was at the door! Come on!

45:36.546 --> 45:39.637
I'm a little paranoid. So what?
Where you going, Paul?

45:39.737 --> 45:41.569
Wherever the fuck I want to.

45:41.669 --> 45:44.839
What about the woman's scream?
I imagined that, right? I imagined that?

45:44.939 --> 45:48.207
You know, you're a real disappointment,
Paul. Any excuse, not to work?

45:48.307 --> 45:52.079
I invite you to my home,
and I'm a prisoner in my own house?

45:52.179 --> 45:53.647
Hey!

45:58.552 --> 46:00.721
Look at what you made me do, Paul.

46:09.314 --> 46:12.296
Don't make me hurt you. Do not!

46:13.766 --> 46:16.603
Don't make me hurt you.

46:17.822 --> 46:19.707
Don't make me hurt you.

46:22.841 --> 46:26.347
You know, I don't know what you're
talking about with that woman screaming.

46:26.447 --> 46:30.284
And, yeah, you bet
strangers make me nervous...

46:30.384 --> 46:34.016
...as you would be,
if you'd just got out of prison.

46:38.424 --> 46:41.094
They're looking for you, aren't they?

46:41.194 --> 46:44.932
Doesn't matter. I ain't never going back.

46:51.037 --> 46:54.842
Get some rest, Paul.
Got a lot of work to do tomorrow.

47:39.387 --> 47:40.954
Shit.

47:47.994 --> 47:52.533
Now, in the movies, you grab two wires
from under the steering column...

47:52.633 --> 47:55.435
...touch 'em together, engine starts, right?

47:55.535 --> 47:58.745
- Right.
- What's in the bag, Paul?

48:00.273 --> 48:03.278
- We had an agreement.
- What do you want me to say?

48:05.812 --> 48:09.283
All right. I... I was going to drink.

48:09.383 --> 48:10.951
Alone.

48:11.818 --> 48:13.878
That's why you're stuck, Paul.

48:15.988 --> 48:18.192
Come on. Come with me.

48:18.792 --> 48:20.594
Come on!

48:21.160 --> 48:23.029
Grab your bag.

48:28.635 --> 48:30.871
Take the booze out of the bag.

48:38.811 --> 48:41.282
You don't have to be afraid of me, Paul.

48:42.082 --> 48:43.884
I'm here to help you.

48:48.687 --> 48:51.795
Now, I want you to smash it
against that wall over there.

48:51.895 --> 48:53.711
Smash it.

49:26.092 --> 49:28.583
Come on. Get back to work.

50:00.426 --> 50:04.500
Fuck me, fuck me, fuck me, fuck me.

50:05.331 --> 50:07.167
Fuck me.

50:36.129 --> 50:39.165
- Laura.
- I've been calling you for days.

50:39.465 --> 50:43.182
I'm confused. I mean, maybe you don't want
me to be your real estate agent anymore...

50:43.282 --> 50:45.696
...but you asked me out.

50:45.796 --> 50:48.367
It was date, right?
I mean, maybe I got that wrong...

50:48.467 --> 50:51.234
- Get in your car and leave right now.
- What happened to your face? Why?

50:51.334 --> 50:53.910
- There's no time. There's someone else here.
- What's going on? Who?

50:54.010 --> 50:56.701
Give me the keys. Trust me. Get in.

50:58.017 --> 51:01.088
- What's going on?
- I'll explain to you later, I'm sorry.

51:01.188 --> 51:04.844
Tell me later? Paul, what is going on?
You have to tell me.

51:04.944 --> 51:08.028
- Where are you going?
- I'll explain later!

51:28.982 --> 51:31.398
Out! Out!

51:31.498 --> 51:34.108
- Do what he says. Do what he says.
- Move!

51:34.208 --> 51:36.623
- Now you, Paul, take the keys out!
- Jack, calm down, calm down!

51:36.723 --> 51:39.192
Get out! Move!

51:39.492 --> 51:42.262
- You, go!
- Jack, calm down. Calm down, please.

51:42.362 --> 51:46.066
Take off the hand brake, and start
pushing the car into the pond.

51:46.166 --> 51:48.202
You, help him!

51:48.402 --> 51:49.903
Move!

51:52.739 --> 51:56.142
Move! Faster! Faster!

52:01.647 --> 52:04.395
Now move. Get up to the house.

52:29.976 --> 52:31.778
I'll get it.

52:41.788 --> 52:43.323
Marion?

52:44.257 --> 52:46.127
She's the babysitter.

52:47.227 --> 52:51.631
Please, let me go.
I have a baby, please, let me...

52:54.167 --> 52:55.669
Please.

52:58.772 --> 53:03.052
You see how disorientated people get
when their future is uncertain?

53:05.478 --> 53:08.100
They always tend to imagine the worst.

53:09.016 --> 53:10.884
You too, Paul.

53:11.417 --> 53:13.687
You always imagine the worst.

53:19.722 --> 53:21.782
What's the sheriff doing here?

53:21.882 --> 53:23.797
No idea.

53:23.897 --> 53:25.699
Come on.

53:26.599 --> 53:28.434
Come on.

53:32.104 --> 53:34.508
You're both smart enough
not to try anything, right?

53:34.608 --> 53:36.176
Right.

53:39.111 --> 53:40.614
Paul.

53:44.918 --> 53:46.186
- Hey.
- Hey.

53:46.286 --> 53:48.933
Deputy Carcano. How can I help you?

53:49.356 --> 53:52.159
You shouldn't leave your tools out
in this weather, they'll get rusty.

53:52.259 --> 53:54.561
Yeah. I'll get around to it.

53:54.661 --> 53:58.298
- You know, it's been busy.
- Listen, we're looking for this woman.

53:58.398 --> 54:01.589
I was wondering if by any chance
you've seen her? Michelle Emerson?

54:04.132 --> 54:06.387
No, no, no, I'm sorry.

54:07.207 --> 54:11.211
- You know, I haven't.
- She works for the post office.

54:11.511 --> 54:15.352
According to the tracking log, she was
due to deliver a package earlier today...

54:15.452 --> 54:17.268
...from Los Angeles.

54:17.450 --> 54:19.686
- Here?
- Yeah.

54:20.124 --> 54:24.391
Hold on, hold on, hold on. I was expecting
something from my agent, yeah.

54:24.491 --> 54:29.176
But I never got it, and I didn't see
this woman, that's for sure.

54:30.764 --> 54:34.600
Do you have a mailbox elsewhere on
the property? Perhaps she left it there.

54:34.700 --> 54:39.006
No, no, no. Everything I get is
dropped off here at the house, yeah.

54:39.106 --> 54:41.188
Right, right.

54:41.623 --> 54:43.944
Well, listen, thanks for your time.

54:44.044 --> 54:46.146
If you see something...

54:46.246 --> 54:49.516
- ...you know where to find me.
- Carcano!

54:53.020 --> 54:54.945
Get down!

54:55.355 --> 54:57.557
- Get up! Get up!
- Okay, alright!

54:57.657 --> 54:59.847
- Come here. Come here, come here.
- Get in the trunk!

54:59.947 --> 55:03.284
- Get that window, that window!
- Get in! Move, move!

55:03.964 --> 55:06.900
- Shit. Bolt it, bolt it!
- What?

55:07.100 --> 55:08.268
- Shit!
- Stay right there!

55:08.368 --> 55:10.907
Who's shooting? He shot the cop?

55:11.007 --> 55:13.273
- That's very good, Paul!
- Paul!

55:13.373 --> 55:15.843
You're finally starting to show
some fucking imagination!

55:15.943 --> 55:18.405
He needs us alive,
just in case the cops come back.

55:18.505 --> 55:20.377
I got a great fucking imagination, too!

55:20.477 --> 55:23.317
He's gonna kill us. He's gonna kill us.

55:26.353 --> 55:28.187
Come on!

55:28.287 --> 55:29.723
Come here.

55:29.823 --> 55:31.624
Jesus Christ.

55:37.230 --> 55:39.266
He just killed a cop.

55:41.033 --> 55:43.871
- He just killed a fucking cop!
- Laura, please!

55:43.971 --> 55:45.939
Stop it!

55:46.039 --> 55:48.842
It's about thinking now, all right?

56:12.665 --> 56:14.668
How old is your kid?

56:18.937 --> 56:20.440
Two.

56:21.307 --> 56:22.842
Two.

56:25.277 --> 56:27.348
I can't think about that right now.

56:28.148 --> 56:30.584
We're gonna... hey, listen.

56:31.484 --> 56:33.553
We're going to get out of here.

56:34.188 --> 56:37.657
- We can't just sit here.
- Hold on, hold on, hold on.

56:38.857 --> 56:40.727
You hear that?

56:41.060 --> 56:42.596
What?

56:42.996 --> 56:45.565
Yeah, there is a railroad
two miles from here.

56:45.665 --> 56:47.935
A train goes by every half an hour.

56:53.372 --> 56:56.209
- He's on the roof.
- What's he doing?

57:06.869 --> 57:08.438
What's he doing?

57:24.536 --> 57:26.773
This is our chance.
This is our chance, we gotta go.

57:26.873 --> 57:29.543
We gotta go, we gotta go. Go, go.

57:29.943 --> 57:32.441
- You have to run as fast as you can.
- Okay.

57:32.541 --> 57:34.981
Straight to the forest,
straight for the train...

57:35.081 --> 57:39.250
...and don't look back, all right? Now,
go, go, go, go, go. Come on, come on!

57:48.027 --> 57:49.829
Come on!

57:51.830 --> 57:55.875
Come on! The train is over this hill!
Come on!

58:02.141 --> 58:03.977
Come on!

58:06.311 --> 58:08.114
Come on.

58:18.491 --> 58:21.560
- I can't, my ankle.
- Oh, yes, you can.

58:22.829 --> 58:25.264
We're almost there, almost there.

58:27.701 --> 58:30.305
Are we finished playing fucking games, Paul?

58:32.505 --> 58:34.507
Get back to the fucking house!

58:34.607 --> 58:36.409
Come on, Laura.

59:00.432 --> 59:02.301
You okay?

59:06.672 --> 59:08.508
Where... where is he?

59:09.410 --> 59:11.849
Downstairs, I think.

59:19.518 --> 59:21.417
Why is he here?

59:22.639 --> 59:25.729
I picked him up on my way back here.

59:27.861 --> 59:29.697
Come downstairs.

59:37.135 --> 59:39.247
I'm not going down there.

59:59.425 --> 01:00:01.020
Not there.

01:00:02.611 --> 01:00:04.180
There.

01:00:25.635 --> 01:00:27.704
You've been disloyal, Paul.

01:00:28.654 --> 01:00:31.073
You forgot all about our agreement.

01:00:32.292 --> 01:00:34.131
Our agreement?

01:00:38.430 --> 01:00:42.065
You're completely out of your mind.
You know that, right?

01:00:42.165 --> 01:00:45.489
You just killed the fucking sheriff,
and you're talking about the agreement?

01:00:46.139 --> 01:00:48.908
You have been here three days.

01:00:49.108 --> 01:00:52.526
First you put a knife to my throat,
then a gun to my head.

01:00:53.246 --> 01:00:58.206
And maybe I am crazy, too,
because why I didn't toss you out...

01:00:58.306 --> 01:01:00.954
...day one, is baffling to me.

01:01:11.864 --> 01:01:14.122
You still don't get it, do you, Paul?

01:01:15.818 --> 01:01:18.032
I'm the one writing the story.

01:01:18.802 --> 01:01:22.751
I mean, I gave you your chance
until you had that brilliant idea...

01:01:22.851 --> 01:01:24.671
...to open the door.

01:01:24.771 --> 01:01:26.679
It's your fault the sheriff's dead.

01:01:26.779 --> 01:01:30.695
No, no, no, no, no, no.
I didn't kill anybody. You did! You did!

01:01:30.795 --> 01:01:35.456
This is fucking insane!
Why are you still sitting here?

01:01:36.456 --> 01:01:40.893
They're gonna storm this place,
and you are definitely going back to prison.

01:01:40.993 --> 01:01:44.177
Now, how is that for an ending, Jack?

01:01:47.834 --> 01:01:49.636
You know...

01:01:51.637 --> 01:01:53.907
...none of that happens unless I say so.

01:01:56.409 --> 01:02:00.362
And if I do decide
to let them in and kill me...

01:02:04.116 --> 01:02:05.952
...you get to write the story.

01:02:11.723 --> 01:02:13.224
You have to let her go.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.098
What the fuck is her name?

01:02:19.198 --> 01:02:22.035
- Laura.
- Thank you. Laura!

01:02:31.643 --> 01:02:36.086
How does it feel to see a real murder,
not just one in the movies?

01:02:38.200 --> 01:02:41.855
You stab someone, you slit their throat, they
fall to the ground in seconds. Done, dead.

01:02:41.955 --> 01:02:44.457
Well, you know, I'm not interested.
You're a sick person.

01:02:44.557 --> 01:02:46.425
You make your life...

01:02:47.260 --> 01:02:49.017
Hey, let her go!

01:02:50.897 --> 01:02:54.244
- Stay right there.
- You don't have the guts. Shoot!

01:02:55.435 --> 01:02:57.556
No, stop!

01:03:14.787 --> 01:03:16.355
Jack!

01:03:20.459 --> 01:03:24.263
What the fuck? You let her go, Jack! Come on!

01:03:29.752 --> 01:03:31.621
Where is she?

01:03:33.071 --> 01:03:34.941
What did you do to her?

01:03:38.076 --> 01:03:39.879
What did you... fucker.

01:03:58.664 --> 01:04:00.734
Which actor should play me?

01:04:02.901 --> 01:04:04.637
A fucking maniac.

01:04:04.737 --> 01:04:08.741
You know, you'd have killed me
without a second thought.

01:04:10.776 --> 01:04:14.080
- I like that.
- Why are there scalpels in your bag?

01:04:14.180 --> 01:04:15.709
The trinkets?

01:04:15.909 --> 01:04:18.521
The journal? Is that what it is?

01:04:18.621 --> 01:04:21.861
What does it mean, Jack?

01:04:22.155 --> 01:04:24.357
It means you have no manners.

01:04:25.057 --> 01:04:27.330
Going through a guest's belongings.

01:04:28.728 --> 01:04:30.764
Nothing worse than betrayal.

01:04:33.699 --> 01:04:35.969
I'm gonna finish our story, Paul.

01:04:36.669 --> 01:04:38.837
You're not capable of it.

01:07:51.496 --> 01:07:54.136
You finally found some imagination.

01:07:54.237 --> 01:07:56.402
What did you do, Jack?

01:07:58.636 --> 01:08:00.589
Where is your knife?

01:08:02.441 --> 01:08:04.023
Throw it over there.

01:08:08.914 --> 01:08:10.864
It's okay.

01:08:10.964 --> 01:08:12.812
Nobody knows she's here.

01:08:13.252 --> 01:08:16.386
We'll get rid of the body,
it'll be like nothing ever happened.

01:08:16.486 --> 01:08:18.372
Come on. We got some work to do.

01:08:18.473 --> 01:08:21.277
- Let's put an end to this...
- Stay right there!

01:08:22.260 --> 01:08:25.732
- This is gonna end the way I want.
- There's only one way this'll end, Paul.

01:08:26.631 --> 01:08:29.560
We clean this shit up before the cops
come here and find out what we did.

01:08:29.660 --> 01:08:33.372
We didn't do anything. You did! Alone!

01:08:33.471 --> 01:08:36.339
- And I need the police to find that out.
- You need the police?

01:08:36.439 --> 01:08:41.326
Yes, I do. I can recognize a sign from
providence when I come across one...

01:08:41.426 --> 01:08:43.995
...because I have received so few.

01:08:44.250 --> 01:08:46.519
Oy, come over here.

01:08:48.819 --> 01:08:51.674
Hands on your head, get on the ground.

01:08:57.542 --> 01:09:00.162
I am grateful to you, Jack.

01:09:00.832 --> 01:09:03.803
I know it doesn't look like that
right now, but I am.

01:09:03.903 --> 01:09:05.738
And you know why?

01:09:06.388 --> 01:09:09.265
Because you have been sent by God.

01:09:10.309 --> 01:09:14.412
A drifter, barely a step ahead of the cops...

01:09:14.513 --> 01:09:18.747
...running and killing these women,
so vulnerable...

01:09:18.848 --> 01:09:22.220
...stolen away and butchered
somewhere in the dark of the woods.

01:09:22.321 --> 01:09:26.823
But chance has made me the one to stop you.

01:09:26.924 --> 01:09:30.529
- I didn't kill these women.
- You don't have to convince me.

01:09:44.742 --> 01:09:47.796
You know why I have never been caught?

01:09:55.887 --> 01:09:59.692
When providence signals to me...

01:10:01.860 --> 01:10:04.728
...I recognize it instantly.

01:10:06.131 --> 01:10:11.561
A woman alone in her car waiting
for her boyfriend to get out of work.

01:10:12.461 --> 01:10:14.340
He's late.

01:10:14.540 --> 01:10:18.345
She rolls down her window
to have a cigarette.

01:10:18.845 --> 01:10:21.248
Her hand hangs outside.

01:10:22.348 --> 01:10:25.766
Adjusts the rear-view mirror and...

01:10:25.866 --> 01:10:29.155
...and it feels so clear.

01:10:30.522 --> 01:10:32.433
Or a housewife...

01:10:32.533 --> 01:10:35.749
...out in the woods apart from her family...

01:10:35.849 --> 01:10:37.863
...just long enough.

01:10:39.030 --> 01:10:41.467
Just long enough for me to know...

01:10:41.847 --> 01:10:43.732
...that Providence...

01:10:43.832 --> 01:10:47.679
...is smiling at me, this very moment!

01:10:50.208 --> 01:10:51.710
But...

01:10:56.681 --> 01:10:58.484
...you have to be...

01:10:59.651 --> 01:11:01.654
...able to embrace it.

01:11:02.854 --> 01:11:04.952
The drifter on the side of the road.

01:11:06.492 --> 01:11:10.296
Don't let him walk away. Pick him up.

01:11:10.396 --> 01:11:12.431
Dress him for the part.

01:11:16.592 --> 01:11:21.039
I have to say you really made me earn this.

01:11:23.139 --> 01:11:24.644
Yeah.

01:11:24.944 --> 01:11:27.936
You think you know more
than me about reality?

01:11:29.281 --> 01:11:30.640
I'm only a writer, right?

01:11:35.253 --> 01:11:37.324
I'm gonna show you reality.

01:11:38.424 --> 01:11:42.094
You build it. Now stand up.

01:11:43.795 --> 01:11:45.464
Stand up!

01:11:52.570 --> 01:11:54.440
All right, Jack.

01:11:54.540 --> 01:11:56.609
This is how the story ends.

01:12:53.597 --> 01:12:55.425
Go to zone two.

01:12:55.625 --> 01:12:57.118
Yeah.

01:12:57.903 --> 01:12:59.738
Cover your ears.

01:13:14.920 --> 01:13:16.822
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm good, I'm good.

01:13:16.922 --> 01:13:19.558
- He's mine.
- Okay, go get him.

01:13:37.910 --> 01:13:40.380
I'll take care of it.
I'll tell them you had guests.

01:13:47.018 --> 01:13:48.894
Where's the K-9 unit?

01:13:53.658 --> 01:13:55.461
Over here?

01:14:13.978 --> 01:14:17.052
Well, I got a great fucking imagination, too!

01:14:20.618 --> 01:14:22.455
He's on the roof.

01:14:39.737 --> 01:14:43.975
This is our chance. This is our chance.
We gotta go, we gotta go, we gotta go.

01:15:06.097 --> 01:15:08.134
Did you check the prints?

01:15:22.580 --> 01:15:24.416
- Hey, boss.
- Good job.

01:15:24.516 --> 01:15:26.118
Thanks.

01:15:35.293 --> 01:15:36.829
Hey.

01:15:40.031 --> 01:15:41.834
How you holding up?

01:15:42.534 --> 01:15:44.147
Good.

01:15:44.247 --> 01:15:46.066
You good?

01:15:46.537 --> 01:15:48.074
Yeah.

01:15:48.774 --> 01:15:52.210
I'm proud of you. You hung right in there.

01:15:52.310 --> 01:15:56.717
Look, Jack, he's a little crazy,
but he's my guy.

01:16:14.166 --> 01:16:17.002
Okay, guys, clear out.

01:16:37.822 --> 01:16:39.357
Here.

01:16:39.957 --> 01:16:42.179
Make the most of it.

01:16:43.028 --> 01:16:45.099
It's gonna be your last for a while.

01:16:47.665 --> 01:16:50.296
We've been tracking you down for three years.

01:16:51.036 --> 01:16:54.006
Never found a crime scene
until it was too late.

01:16:54.106 --> 01:16:55.941
And even then...

01:16:58.109 --> 01:16:59.945
...you left us nothing.

01:17:01.829 --> 01:17:03.249
Until now.

01:17:15.693 --> 01:17:17.925
We're out in the open here, Paul.

01:17:18.497 --> 01:17:20.332
No more secrets.

01:17:25.803 --> 01:17:27.807
Perhaps you'll remember this.

01:17:28.607 --> 01:17:32.244
Know why I have never been caught?

01:17:32.344 --> 01:17:36.248
When providence signals to me...

01:17:36.548 --> 01:17:39.385
...I recognize it instantly.

01:17:40.685 --> 01:17:45.270
A woman alone in her car waiting
for her boyfriend to get out work.

01:17:47.959 --> 01:17:51.964
I hate myself for not catching you
before you got to Nancy Barrows.

01:17:52.714 --> 01:17:54.784
I'll carry that to my grave.

01:17:57.868 --> 01:17:59.832
Four victims.

01:18:00.572 --> 01:18:04.983
Now, we found all the bodies, all except one.

01:18:05.644 --> 01:18:07.413
The first...

01:18:07.513 --> 01:18:10.715
...your wife, Renee.

01:18:14.118 --> 01:18:16.188
Tell me where you buried her.

01:18:18.389 --> 01:18:20.258
How can I?

01:18:21.325 --> 01:18:23.395
I haven't seen her...

01:18:24.795 --> 01:18:26.799
...since she left me.

01:18:31.969 --> 01:18:36.237
Come on, buddy.
Tell me where you buried your wife.

01:18:36.975 --> 01:18:40.979
The jury will see it
as a gesture of goodwill.

01:18:41.079 --> 01:18:43.731
It'll help you when you come to sentencing.

01:18:44.800 --> 01:18:47.587
Give Renee's family some closure.

01:18:48.487 --> 01:18:50.489
They deserve it, don't you think?

01:18:50.589 --> 01:18:52.860
I don't know what you're talking about...

01:18:54.026 --> 01:18:55.894
...whoever you are.

01:18:57.194 --> 01:18:58.697
Okay.

01:19:03.367 --> 01:19:06.206
We're gonna convict you
of every murder you've ever done.

01:19:09.440 --> 01:19:11.509
You're going to convict me?

01:19:13.694 --> 01:19:15.530
With what?

01:19:17.515 --> 01:19:20.211
Everything you have in that bag is tainted.

01:19:21.019 --> 01:19:22.554
Planted.

01:19:24.755 --> 01:19:26.258
You're...

01:19:26.558 --> 01:19:30.795
...so in need of a scapegoat
that it's pathetic.

01:19:32.005 --> 01:19:34.014
You come To my house...

01:19:34.114 --> 01:19:36.629
...with a bag of evidence
you collected from the bodies.

01:19:36.729 --> 01:19:40.373
Bodies you had access to,
and trying to hang it on me?

01:19:42.373 --> 01:19:44.209
The tape?

01:19:45.710 --> 01:19:47.933
Do you think that's my confession?

01:19:49.047 --> 01:19:52.682
I was thinking my screenplay aloud. So what?

01:19:53.651 --> 01:19:55.654
It was dialogue for a character.

01:19:56.154 --> 01:19:58.799
Method writing, if you wanna call it that.

01:20:01.025 --> 01:20:04.576
Isn't that what we were doing...

01:20:04.796 --> 01:20:08.684
...you and I, when you held
a knife to my throat?

01:20:09.100 --> 01:20:11.837
If you are so fucking sure of yourself...

01:20:11.937 --> 01:20:15.774
...why harass me for my wife's body?

01:20:16.274 --> 01:20:20.771
You had me at gunpoint!
I was a hostage in my own house!

01:20:22.280 --> 01:20:25.917
Where did you think you're going
with this harebrained scam?

01:20:27.184 --> 01:20:29.622
Are you guys completely insane?

01:20:34.158 --> 01:20:36.230
Is that the way you're gonna play it, Paul?

01:20:39.630 --> 01:20:41.166
Okay.

01:20:43.167 --> 01:20:45.695
An innocent man would have
just said, "I didn't do it."

01:21:04.388 --> 01:21:08.406
- Hey, there, Deputy Carcano.
- Dive team says there's nothing in the pond.

01:21:09.077 --> 01:21:10.946
Nothing from K-9 unit.

01:21:12.062 --> 01:21:13.647
Fuck.

01:21:14.299 --> 01:21:16.168
Have them keep looking.

01:21:25.009 --> 01:21:26.845
Doesn't look good.

01:21:27.245 --> 01:21:30.753
Got physical evidence
that he's gonna say you planted.

01:21:30.853 --> 01:21:33.985
We got him on tape, and I don't know
how you get into this storytelling thing...

01:21:34.085 --> 01:21:36.388
...but he's gonna say
that's what he was doing there...

01:21:36.488 --> 01:21:38.790
...and that creates plausible deniability.

01:21:38.890 --> 01:21:42.694
- His word against mine?
- Well, you don't have to convince me, Jack.

01:21:43.144 --> 01:21:47.566
Look, you've worked too hard
on this one for it to not go our way.

01:21:48.166 --> 01:21:52.008
I don't think I have to tell you,
without a confession, we're fucked.

01:21:52.938 --> 01:21:54.686
Fuck.

01:22:16.227 --> 01:22:17.829
- Jack.
- Yeah.

01:22:17.929 --> 01:22:20.731
The boss is gonna book him.
They want you inside.

01:22:21.266 --> 01:22:23.135
All right.

01:22:59.770 --> 01:23:01.573
Look at this photograph.

01:23:05.910 --> 01:23:08.950
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah.

01:23:32.937 --> 01:23:34.939
Better times, huh?

01:23:40.311 --> 01:23:42.114
Your beautiful wife...

01:23:43.530 --> 01:23:45.811
...outside of your rustic retreat.

01:23:47.785 --> 01:23:49.388
But something's missing.

01:23:56.894 --> 01:23:58.547
Tell me something, Paul.

01:24:00.194 --> 01:24:02.534
If I was to dig underneath your pond...

01:24:02.634 --> 01:24:05.471
...I mean, really underneath your pond...

01:24:06.737 --> 01:24:08.940
...would I find your wife?

01:24:17.314 --> 01:24:19.117
All right, Jack.

01:24:19.717 --> 01:24:23.723
Your odds in court went up, no question.

01:24:30.995 --> 01:24:34.800
Can I talk to you, just you and me?

01:24:35.750 --> 01:24:37.620
Clear the room, guys.

01:24:38.470 --> 01:24:40.305
Let's go.

01:24:43.001 --> 01:24:44.876
I'm all ears.

01:24:48.045 --> 01:24:50.282
You have no idea...

01:24:51.415 --> 01:24:53.532
...the pain I'm holding inside.

01:24:53.632 --> 01:24:56.922
Just don't! Listen to me. Hear me out.

01:25:00.457 --> 01:25:03.861
This is an idea for a... for a deal.

01:25:06.430 --> 01:25:08.233
Full confession.

01:25:10.167 --> 01:25:12.570
I'll give you every detail...

01:25:14.171 --> 01:25:15.732
...of...

01:25:16.451 --> 01:25:18.753
...every one of the victims' remains...

01:25:18.853 --> 01:25:22.347
...for every crime scene, everything.

01:25:22.447 --> 01:25:24.517
I have a great memory.

01:25:25.817 --> 01:25:29.421
I wrap up your case neatly with a bright bow.

01:25:31.852 --> 01:25:33.491
But no needle.

01:25:35.559 --> 01:25:39.845
Lock me up in a mental institution,
whatever, but no needle.

01:25:41.283 --> 01:25:44.553
I deserve to live with this pain.

01:25:54.778 --> 01:25:56.779
You had your chance with me.

01:25:57.849 --> 01:26:01.286
- I'm done.
- No, listen to me! You owe this to me.

01:26:03.087 --> 01:26:05.790
It was up to me to pick you up on the road.

01:26:05.890 --> 01:26:09.361
My decision, my idea, it was always my story.

01:26:10.261 --> 01:26:14.902
Was it real enough for you? It seems
like it was. I gave you all of this!

01:26:17.534 --> 01:26:19.771
But you owe me my ending.

01:26:30.280 --> 01:26:32.417
I like my ending better.
