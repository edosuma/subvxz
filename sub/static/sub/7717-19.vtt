WEBVTT

00:08.575 --> 00:10.709
- Didn't you get the memo?
No,it's stairmageddon.Ing.

00:10.711 --> 00:12.478
[claps]
come on, stanley!

00:12.480 --> 00:15.547
Dwight is having maintenance
done on the elevator today,

00:15.549 --> 00:17.149
And he was really
on top of it.

00:17.151 --> 00:20.252
The stairmageddon
awareness campaign.

00:20.254 --> 00:24.189
The idea was to get us prepared,
both mentally and physically,

00:24.191 --> 00:28.293
For a day that hopefully
comes once in 100 years.

00:28.295 --> 00:30.496
It's a "mageddon!"

00:30.498 --> 00:33.232
Come on!
Come on, stanley.

00:33.234 --> 00:37.803
- I put 17 damn years
into this company,

00:37.805 --> 00:40.639
And now they're making me
climb stair mountain!

00:40.641 --> 00:42.141
- Come on!

00:42.143 --> 00:44.243
- Our office has
an unusually large number

00:44.245 --> 00:46.478
Of unusually large people.

00:46.480 --> 00:49.748
- This is an abomination.
- Come on.

00:49.750 --> 00:53.352
- So when something as routine
as elevator maintenance happens,

00:53.354 --> 00:56.555
And people are forced to expend
cardiovascular effort,

00:56.557 --> 00:59.391
We have to compare it
to the end of time.

00:59.393 --> 01:02.428
[cheerful music]

01:02.430 --> 01:09.368
â™ª

01:09.370 --> 01:11.537
- [muffled]
red alert! Red alert!

01:11.539 --> 01:14.573
The reviews are in!
I repeat, the reviews are in.

01:14.575 --> 01:16.241
- What?

01:16.243 --> 01:17.242
- I just got a text
from my brother.

01:17.244 --> 01:18.510
Scranton times tribune.Com.

01:18.512 --> 01:19.611
There's a review
of the documentary.

01:19.613 --> 01:20.779
- [gasps]
what does it say?

01:20.781 --> 01:24.583
I just got the text and started
screaming, "red alert."

01:24.585 --> 01:26.185
- Well, the alert
was already set to "red"

01:26.187 --> 01:27.586
Because of stairmageddon.

01:27.588 --> 01:29.154
You think I should
set it to "double red"?

01:29.156 --> 01:32.324
- I think we should.

01:32.326 --> 01:33.692
- [groans]

01:33.694 --> 01:35.794
- <i>"the office:</i>

Forever chasing a manager

02:01.589 --> 02:04.556
- What does josh mcauliffe
know about the paper business?

02:04.558 --> 02:06.558
He works for a news...

02:23.544 --> 02:26.678

02:26.680 --> 02:29.848
Is his surprising

02:29.850 --> 02:31.183
- I want you
to print that out for me.

02:31.185 --> 02:34.720
- Now that this documentary
is coming out,

02:34.722 --> 02:37.156
My days at dunder mifflin
are probably limited.

02:37.158 --> 02:39.358
And you know what? Good.

02:39.360 --> 02:42.394
Because this is not what
I wanted to do with my life.

02:42.396 --> 02:45.364
I wanted to be
my generation's lisa loeb.

02:56.544 --> 02:59.344
- Oh.
Which public figure?

02:59.346 --> 03:02.347
- I bet it's katie couric.
I've been saying this for years.

03:02.349 --> 03:04.249
- No, I think they mean

03:04.251 --> 03:08.854
More like a politician.

03:08.856 --> 03:11.456
[stanley grunting,
wheezing]

03:11.458 --> 03:13.825
- You own the building.

03:13.827 --> 03:16.261
Why can't you fix the elevator
in the middle of the night?

03:16.263 --> 03:18.864
Who do I look like,
jackie joyner-kersee?

03:18.866 --> 03:22.301
- Well, I did say
it would be an inconvenience.

03:22.303 --> 03:23.869
You should've called me
from downstairs.

03:23.871 --> 03:25.237
We could've met
in the lobby.

03:25.239 --> 03:28.307
Here we go.
- Son, you've lost your mind.

03:28.309 --> 03:30.943
I'm not going anywhere
until you fix my elevator.

03:30.945 --> 03:32.778
- The buyer
is your sister's friend.

03:32.780 --> 03:34.313
This is the printing paper

03:34.315 --> 03:36.782
For the entire school district
of lackawanna.

03:36.784 --> 03:39.418
You are coming,
and that's an order.

03:39.420 --> 03:41.620
- You are not my damn boss
and you never will be!

03:41.622 --> 03:42.921
Guess what?

03:42.923 --> 03:45.224
Never gonna happen!

03:45.226 --> 03:48.227
Pete, iced tea.
Three sugars, five creams.

03:48.229 --> 03:50.295
- Your morning 3x5.

03:50.297 --> 03:53.565
Coming right up.

03:53.567 --> 03:54.900
- Well, we won't be late.

03:54.902 --> 03:58.237
I love you, mom.
Thanks.

03:58.239 --> 04:00.272
- Oh, your mom's
watching the kids tonight.

04:00.274 --> 04:01.740
So what are you two up to?
[chuckles]

04:01.742 --> 04:04.343
Oh, um, embassy suites.

04:04.345 --> 04:05.677
"do not disturb" sign
on the door.

04:05.679 --> 04:06.845
Mommy and daddy
are on the floor.

04:06.847 --> 04:08.947
- [laughs]
I wish.

04:08.949 --> 04:09.948
- What, then?

04:09.950 --> 04:14.586
- Oh, nothing that exciting.

04:19.659 --> 04:21.493
- Marriage counseling?

04:21.495 --> 04:22.961
Hmm.

04:22.963 --> 04:25.397
Did you know that is
the only kind of counseling

04:25.399 --> 04:26.865
I have never had?

04:26.867 --> 04:28.600
- You know, jim's kind of
nervous about it,

04:28.602 --> 04:30.369
But I think it could
really help.

04:30.371 --> 04:34.273
It can't hurt to talk
about them, right?

04:38.745 --> 04:41.280
- Hey, toby.

04:41.282 --> 04:43.048
Um, I wanted
to ask you a question.

04:43.050 --> 04:45.417
- Oh, sure.

04:45.419 --> 04:46.618
- It's a little,
uh, personal.

04:46.620 --> 04:48.053
- Let's do it.
Let's get personal.

04:48.055 --> 04:49.354
- I wanted to talk to you
about your divorce.

04:49.356 --> 04:51.523
- Whoa.

04:51.525 --> 04:54.693
- Sorry. I-- no, no, no,
what I meant--what I meant--

04:54.695 --> 04:56.295
- Oh, yeah, no, it's okay.
I can handle it.

04:56.297 --> 04:58.764
Um, so...

04:58.766 --> 05:00.532
- You guys obviously
went through some tough times

05:00.534 --> 05:03.302
Leading up to it.
- [chuckles, snorts]

05:03.304 --> 05:06.938
- Okay. I was wondering if you
ever did any couples counseling?

05:06.940 --> 05:10.375
- Oh, sure,
lots of times. Yeah.

05:10.377 --> 05:13.912
Wait, you and pam aren't
in couples counseling, are you?

05:13.914 --> 05:14.913
Oh, god.

05:14.915 --> 05:20.385
Uh, we're just starting
couples counseling.

05:20.387 --> 05:23.322
Uh, which doesn't
sound any better.

05:23.324 --> 05:27.693
- Oh, you guys.
Kelly called it.

05:27.695 --> 05:29.428
2013.

05:29.430 --> 05:31.096
So s--hey!

05:31.098 --> 05:33.732
Hey, hey, no! No.
Get outta here.

05:33.734 --> 05:35.334
Clark, get outta here.
- My mistake.

05:35.336 --> 05:37.102
- Yes, it is your mistake.

05:37.104 --> 05:39.638
He's lingering.
So annoying.

05:39.640 --> 05:41.340
I'm gonna kill him.

05:41.342 --> 05:43.108
How can I help?
I'm here.

05:43.110 --> 05:45.043
- That's all right.

05:45.045 --> 05:46.712
- Hello,
william morris agency.

05:46.714 --> 05:48.380
I need to speak
with your best agent

05:48.382 --> 05:50.582
Who represents
your biggest stars.

05:50.584 --> 05:53.352
Yes, I'll hold.

05:53.354 --> 05:57.422
I'm sorry.
I misunderstood. Good-bye.

06:04.063 --> 06:06.765
- Thank you, stan.

06:06.767 --> 06:08.500
Oh, honey.

06:08.502 --> 06:12.404
Look, I just want our life
to get back to normal.

06:12.406 --> 06:14.139
Ribbon cuttings,
charity balls.

06:14.141 --> 06:15.440
- Don't worry,
I've scheduled

06:15.442 --> 06:17.476
A press conference
for later today.

06:17.478 --> 06:20.379
We just need to face
the cameras together.

06:20.381 --> 06:23.014
A beloved public servant
and his devoted wife.

06:23.016 --> 06:24.816
And move on.

06:24.818 --> 06:27.052
- All right,
if I have to be the good wife,

06:27.054 --> 06:28.787
I'll be the best damn wife
there is.

06:28.789 --> 06:32.090
Correction. Best darn wife.

06:32.092 --> 06:35.060
Sorry.
I'm a better wife than that.

06:35.062 --> 06:38.563
- Andy--[knocks]
I need to talk to you.

06:38.565 --> 06:39.898
- Yeah, come on in.

06:39.900 --> 06:42.134
I'm just on hold
with another talent agency.

06:42.136 --> 06:44.169
This promo
with me playing banjo

06:44.171 --> 06:46.104
Has 250 views already.

06:46.106 --> 06:48.039
And every time I click,
there's more.

06:48.041 --> 06:49.441
251.

06:49.443 --> 06:51.443
252.
I can't even keep up!

06:51.445 --> 06:52.944
- Stanley is refusing
to go out on a sales call.

06:52.946 --> 06:54.946
- [grunts]

06:54.948 --> 06:56.948
I hate people!

06:56.950 --> 06:58.650
Why do they never do
what you need them to do?

06:58.652 --> 06:59.751
Stanley has to go.
That's final.

06:59.753 --> 07:01.620
- So what I'm
hearing you say is,

07:01.622 --> 07:02.954
"make stanley
go out on the sales call

07:02.956 --> 07:04.189
By whatever means possible"?

07:04.191 --> 07:06.158
- Yes!

07:06.160 --> 07:07.659
I'm sorry I'm being curt,

07:07.661 --> 07:10.429
It's just I'm about to land
a top talent agent.

07:10.431 --> 07:12.864
- Mm-hmm. Good luck.

07:12.866 --> 07:15.567
- Directory?

07:15.569 --> 07:18.503
Movie star department.

07:18.505 --> 07:21.039
Back. Directory.

07:21.041 --> 07:23.642
- For five years I've held
my instincts in check

07:23.644 --> 07:25.577
Because I wanted
to be made manager.

07:25.579 --> 07:30.182
Maybe it's time for me
to just let that thought go.

07:30.184 --> 07:33.718
It's kind of painful,
but it's also freeing in a way.

07:33.720 --> 07:36.888
Now it's all
about my instincts.

07:41.027 --> 07:42.027
- Hey, dwight.

07:42.029 --> 07:45.096
- Stanley,
one way or another,

07:45.098 --> 07:47.199
You are gonna come with me
to make this sale.

07:47.201 --> 07:48.700
- Pass.

07:48.702 --> 07:50.235
- Hey, c-can you just
let me out of here

07:50.237 --> 07:53.104
- Don't worry,
it's just a bull tranquilizer.

07:53.106 --> 07:57.142
It's just a man pointing a bull
tranquilizer at a coworker.

07:57.144 --> 07:59.711
- Dwight,
you do not learn, do you?

07:59.713 --> 08:02.981
For a threat to be credible,
you ha--

08:02.983 --> 08:04.616
- Holy [bleep].

08:04.618 --> 08:07.085
- No, you didn't.

08:07.087 --> 08:10.989
Sick of you and your--ooh--
[tranquilizer gun fires]

08:10.991 --> 08:13.058
[thud]

08:15.595 --> 08:17.796
- It's all right.
Andy approved it.

08:19.932 --> 08:23.235
- Man, he's really
- is he gonna be okay?

08:23.237 --> 08:25.237
I mean, weren't those darts
intended for an animal,

08:25.239 --> 08:28.974
Like, two to three times
larger than him

08:28.976 --> 08:31.276
- Okay, this dosage was meant
for a very small bull,

08:31.278 --> 08:33.512
And stanley's got way more
body fat than they do.

08:33.514 --> 08:37.849
- You gave him three shots.
- Shh.

08:37.851 --> 08:39.150
Got about 45 minutes

08:39.152 --> 08:41.119
To get him to the client
before he comes to.

08:41.121 --> 08:44.289
Grab his feet.
[grunts]

08:44.291 --> 08:46.258
Let's go. Move it!
- All right.

08:46.260 --> 08:48.260
- One, two, three.

08:48.262 --> 08:49.794
[grunts]

08:49.796 --> 08:52.130
He's like a manatee.

08:52.132 --> 08:53.932
Ready? Let's go again.
Come on.

08:53.934 --> 08:55.667
We can do this.

08:55.669 --> 08:57.869
One, two, three!

08:57.871 --> 08:59.237
[thumps]

08:59.239 --> 09:00.872
Oh, god.

09:00.874 --> 09:03.275
No wonder my elevator cables
are under such strain.

09:03.277 --> 09:05.110
- We gotta get a wheelbarrow
or something.

09:05.112 --> 09:07.812
- Yes.

09:07.814 --> 09:09.247
[grunts]

09:09.249 --> 09:12.183
Okay. We're good.
We're good. Let's go.

09:12.185 --> 09:14.786
- Oh, my god.

09:14.788 --> 09:17.322
- Push.
- I am!

09:18.257 --> 09:19.925
Any good weekend plans?

09:19.927 --> 09:21.626
- I might see a movie.
- Nice.

09:21.628 --> 09:22.794
- What about you?

09:22.796 --> 09:24.262
- Uh, I don't know yet.

09:24.264 --> 09:25.997
- [grunts] let's take him--
- I was thinking about...

09:25.999 --> 09:28.667
- Let's go right to the top
of the stairs, okay?

09:28.669 --> 09:31.269
- And then what?

09:31.271 --> 09:33.238
- Okay, listen.

09:33.240 --> 09:34.706
I'm kind of embarrassed
to admit this,

09:34.708 --> 09:37.108
But I've never actually
done this before.

09:37.110 --> 09:41.246
- Well, if I may,
you're a natural.

09:41.248 --> 09:42.747
- Thank you.

09:42.749 --> 09:44.215
I mean, I've rehearsed it
in my head,

09:44.217 --> 09:45.584
Like, 1,000 times,
but, uh...

09:45.586 --> 09:47.586
- That's a little weird.

09:47.588 --> 09:50.322
I know. Evel knievel.

09:58.297 --> 10:00.632
- That's about as good
as that's gonna be.

10:00.634 --> 10:02.267
- Okay, now here's the plan.

10:02.269 --> 10:05.103
I need you to go down
to the bottom and catch him.

10:05.105 --> 10:06.371
- Catch?
- Yeah.

10:06.373 --> 10:08.206
- I can't catch him,
he's, like, 250 pounds.

10:08.208 --> 10:11.276
- You use your hands and just
blunt his descent, okay?

10:11.278 --> 10:13.111
He's gonna be moving slowly.
- Blunt?

10:13.113 --> 10:16.014
- It's only--it's 15 feet down,
it's at a 45-degree angle.

10:16.016 --> 10:18.183
Get set in your haunches, it's
like your catching a medicine--

10:18.185 --> 10:19.985
- Dude,
the size of my haunches--

10:19.987 --> 10:22.921
[thumps]

10:22.923 --> 10:25.624
- Okay, good call.

10:25.626 --> 10:27.092
He would have put
a hole in your chest

10:27.094 --> 10:33.632
- We should probably call
a doctor or something, dude.

10:36.770 --> 10:40.305
- So how does it work?
Is it like, you know,

10:40.307 --> 10:41.840
The action of talking to
a third party

10:41.842 --> 10:43.775
Breaks up the log jam, or...

10:43.777 --> 10:45.377
- You're really there
to talk to each other.

10:45.379 --> 10:49.247
I would say that the therapist
is more of a facilitator.

10:49.249 --> 10:51.216
- Mm-hmm.

10:51.218 --> 10:53.051
- He might start
by asking each of you,

10:53.053 --> 10:54.853
"why do you
think you're here?"

10:54.855 --> 10:57.689
- He took this job in philly
without telling me.

10:57.691 --> 11:00.025
He bought our house
without telling me.

11:00.027 --> 11:02.661
At a certain point, he shouldn't
be rewarded for that.

11:02.663 --> 11:05.930
- If I didn't do certain things
without telling pam,

11:05.932 --> 11:10.435
She'd be married to roy...
[chuckles]

11:10.437 --> 11:12.937
- I feel like he's always making
these decisions for the family,

11:12.939 --> 11:14.939
And then I'm left
playing catch-up.

11:14.941 --> 11:17.909
- If she can just hang on
for a little while longer,

11:17.911 --> 11:20.345
I--this will be so huge
for our family.

11:20.347 --> 11:23.448
- Well,
what's a little while?

11:23.450 --> 11:25.183
- What do you mean?

11:25.185 --> 11:27.752
- I mean,
what's the end date?

11:27.754 --> 11:30.689
It must be really hard for her
to sign on to be unhappy

11:30.691 --> 11:33.024
If she doesn't know
when it's gonna end.

11:33.026 --> 11:38.096
- That's kind of
an impossible question.

11:40.366 --> 11:42.167
- Oh, guys, it's starting!
Hurry!

11:45.204 --> 11:47.238
- Ooh, there's angela.

11:47.240 --> 11:48.239
I work with her.

11:48.241 --> 11:50.075
- Huh. Yeah.
[chuckles]

11:50.077 --> 11:53.278
I mean, I'm happy angela's
the first one getting famous,

11:53.280 --> 11:56.448
But it's a little weird, no?

11:56.450 --> 11:57.949
I mean, she can't
sing or act,

11:57.951 --> 11:59.451
So it's actually
kind of insane,

11:59.453 --> 12:01.286
If you think about it.

12:01.288 --> 12:02.754
- Her hair looks beautiful.

12:02.756 --> 12:04.122
- Yeah,
we get it, phyllis,

12:04.124 --> 12:06.191
She looks like
a freakin' movie star!

12:06.193 --> 12:08.426
- Andy.

12:08.428 --> 12:11.196
- I would just like
to start by saying

12:11.198 --> 12:15.867
That there have been some rumors
about my personal life

12:15.869 --> 12:18.503
That I would like to settle
once and for all.

12:18.505 --> 12:23.241
As my long-suffering wife
can attest...

12:23.243 --> 12:24.776
I am gay.

12:24.778 --> 12:26.511
[surprised chatter]

12:26.513 --> 12:30.348
- Senator, were you always gay,
or did your wife turn you gay?

12:30.350 --> 12:31.416
- Question
for the senator's beard

12:37.022 --> 12:41.192
-<i>Yo soy homosexual.</i>
For  <i>- poor angela.Atinos,</i>

12:41.194 --> 12:43.294
- [chuckles]
yeah. Poor angela.

12:43.296 --> 12:45.263
- I once believed
that a gay person

12:45.265 --> 12:47.398
Could be somewhat straight.

12:47.400 --> 12:51.169
It wasn't until
my marriage to angela

12:51.171 --> 12:53.538
That I realized how...

12:53.540 --> 12:56.975
Charmless
I find the female body.

12:56.977 --> 12:59.244
- Ooh. Always hurts
to hear that one.

12:59.246 --> 13:02.147
- There's someone else
I need to thank.

13:02.149 --> 13:04.983
His name is oscar martinez.

13:04.985 --> 13:07.118
- Come on.

13:07.120 --> 13:11.122
- Oscar is the one who opened
my eyes to who I really am.

13:11.124 --> 13:14.325
- Oscar is with
the senator too?

13:14.327 --> 13:18.029
- Yes! And I knew it
the whole time.

13:18.031 --> 13:22.400
I kept the secret.
I kept the secret so good.

13:22.402 --> 13:24.235
You didn't know,
you didn't know,

13:24.237 --> 13:26.371
And you didn't
freaking know.

13:26.373 --> 13:28.173
But I knew!

13:28.175 --> 13:30.041
- He knew!
- Yes! We did it.

13:30.043 --> 13:31.910
- You did it, kevin.

13:31.912 --> 13:33.444
- Yes!

13:33.446 --> 13:35.079
Oh!

13:35.081 --> 13:38.483
I did it. I did it.

13:38.485 --> 13:40.485
- With this
new self-awareness,

13:40.487 --> 13:45.089
I was finally able
to find love at long last.

13:45.091 --> 13:46.558
With my amazing...

13:46.560 --> 13:50.228
Chief of staff wesley silver.

13:50.230 --> 13:53.064
- What?
- Wesley silver's gay?

13:53.066 --> 13:56.201
[surprised chatter]
- [gasps]

13:56.203 --> 13:58.136
- They make a nice couple.
- [gags]

13:58.138 --> 14:01.472
[both grunting]

14:01.474 --> 14:04.108
- Almost there.
Almost there.

14:04.110 --> 14:06.544
Okay.

14:06.546 --> 14:08.313
We're running late.
Let's get him inside.

14:08.315 --> 14:11.015
- We can't just leave him
bubble wrapped like this.

14:11.017 --> 14:13.351
The bubble wrap
is the only thing

14:13.353 --> 14:14.953
That's stopping his suit
from getting wrinkled.

14:14.955 --> 14:17.355
These meetings
are all about presentation.

14:17.357 --> 14:19.490
- That's actually
really smart.

14:19.492 --> 14:23.061
- God, if only there was
any other use or situation

14:23.063 --> 14:24.162
For that kind of knowledge.

14:24.164 --> 14:25.396
- Let's get him inside.

14:25.398 --> 14:27.999
- Carla fern is not
just an actor's agent.

14:28.001 --> 14:32.637
She does writers, directors,
travel, and real estate.

14:32.639 --> 14:35.039
Actor?

14:35.041 --> 14:36.341
- Oh, no.
[chuckles]

14:36.343 --> 14:37.642
Well, I have an act.

14:37.644 --> 14:39.878
Dog, cat, mouse.

14:39.880 --> 14:41.613
- Yeah, wow, cool.

14:41.615 --> 14:45.083
Is it hard
to train them to do that?

14:45.085 --> 14:47.185
- Eh, you go through
a lot of mice.

14:47.187 --> 14:49.020
It started by accident,
actually,

14:49.022 --> 14:52.924
And I accidentally
put her on top of my dog,

14:52.926 --> 14:54.592
And I was, like,
so mad at myself at first.

14:54.594 --> 14:58.997
And then I was like, wait.
Wait a second.

14:58.999 --> 15:00.598
- Does anything go
on top of the mouse?

15:00.600 --> 15:02.400
- Yeah.

15:02.402 --> 15:05.370
Little hat. Yeah.
- Aw, that's cute.

15:05.372 --> 15:06.971
What's the mouse's name?

15:06.973 --> 15:12.143
It really doesn't
make sense to name the mice.

15:12.145 --> 15:14.545
They're kind of like
cannon fodder, you know?

15:14.547 --> 15:17.649
You're not one of those
peta guys, are you?

15:17.651 --> 15:20.118
Oh, great.

15:20.120 --> 15:22.453
- Hey, wait, wait, how--
how we doing this?

15:22.455 --> 15:25.924
- Well, I'll grab the forelegs,
and you push his hindquarters.

15:25.926 --> 15:28.293
- Just say "arms" and "legs,"
okay? That just--

15:28.295 --> 15:29.961
That's the vernacular
that I'm comfortable with.

15:29.963 --> 15:31.095
- Fine, let's go.

15:31.097 --> 15:32.530
- [sighs]

15:32.532 --> 15:34.198
- Hoist his shank on three.

15:34.200 --> 15:36.067
- What's a shank?
- It's by the tenderloin.

15:36.069 --> 15:39.637
Roll him, roll him, roll him.
Good. Good.

15:39.639 --> 15:41.606
Okay, careful,
he's slouching.

15:41.608 --> 15:43.675
Okay, can you--
slouch him into the seat.

15:43.677 --> 15:46.144
[grunts] here.
Go around, get the seatbelt.

15:46.146 --> 15:50.181
- All right.

15:50.183 --> 15:54.619
- Got it?
- Yeah--yup.

15:54.621 --> 15:57.522
- [grunts]

15:57.524 --> 15:59.057
Get in the back.

15:59.059 --> 16:00.658
- What?
- Get in the back.

16:00.660 --> 16:03.294
- Aw, come on.
- Get in.

16:10.369 --> 16:14.138
Do you understand
what we're about to do?

16:14.140 --> 16:16.607
- Hello.
- Okay, we--hey.

16:16.609 --> 16:19.043
Hey, listen, listen.

16:19.045 --> 16:22.180
We are going to go discuss
paper contracts

16:22.182 --> 16:25.416
For city of lackawanna
public schools, okay?

16:25.418 --> 16:28.119
- Pigeons.
- Oh, god, this is bad.

16:28.121 --> 16:30.555
Looks like
we've got no choice.

16:30.557 --> 16:35.193
You, my friend, are going to
have to be stanley hudson.

16:35.195 --> 16:39.163
- Isn't the client, like,
best friends with his sister?

16:39.165 --> 16:40.999
- New plan, okay?

16:41.001 --> 16:43.368
We get him a cup of coffee
and we go back to the old plan.

16:43.370 --> 16:45.303
Let's go. Gimme a hand.

16:45.305 --> 16:47.138
Here we go.
Come on, stanley!

16:47.140 --> 16:49.474
Here we go. Upsie-doozie.
There we go.

16:49.476 --> 16:52.744
Okay, all right.
Come on, big guy.

16:52.746 --> 16:54.212
You can walk, right?
Yeah. [laughs]

16:54.214 --> 16:56.114
What a pretty smile.
Let's go.

16:56.116 --> 17:00.151
- I'm sure athlete
will be a huge success.

17:00.153 --> 17:01.719
But I don't want him
to do it anymore,

17:01.721 --> 17:03.421
And I don't want
to give him an ultimatum,

17:03.423 --> 17:06.024
But I am not moving
our family to philly.

17:06.026 --> 17:09.193
- Well, if pam says
she won't go, then--[chuckles]

17:09.195 --> 17:10.595
We're gonna need
a lot more than counseling.

17:10.597 --> 17:12.797
Hmph.

17:12.799 --> 17:16.367
- That was exhausting.

17:16.369 --> 17:18.269
- Blah blah blah blah.

17:18.271 --> 17:19.570
Jim.

17:19.572 --> 17:21.372
- Well, they deserve
each other, then.

17:21.374 --> 17:22.707
- They do. That they do.
- That is for sure.

17:22.709 --> 17:24.342
- [whispers] that they do.

17:31.250 --> 17:33.584
- And for--oh, whoopsie daisy.
[chuckles]

17:33.586 --> 17:35.286
- Stanley,
what is going on here?

17:35.288 --> 17:39.090
He gets carsick really easily.
- Driving.

17:39.092 --> 17:41.125
- It's a long drive.
He was in the backseat.

17:41.127 --> 17:42.660
But right now
we're talking to mrs. Davis

17:42.662 --> 17:44.762
About the full range
of the products that we offer

17:44.764 --> 17:47.532
And our competitive rates,
right, stanley?

17:49.068 --> 17:50.701
- Ooh-hoo,
look at that baby...

17:50.703 --> 17:55.706
- Stanley.
- Oh...

17:55.708 --> 17:57.308
- That's benji
in the middle.

17:57.310 --> 18:00.745
- That's benji.
Oh, he's precious.

18:00.747 --> 18:02.747
That's a healthy-looking baby.

18:02.749 --> 18:04.649
- Very special little boy.

18:04.651 --> 18:09.153
- Look at him. I've never seen
such a beautiful child.

18:09.155 --> 18:10.288
- Funny sense of humor.

18:10.290 --> 18:11.489
If you push his nose,
he'll go, "eee."

18:11.491 --> 18:13.424
- Like this? Watch.
- Eee.

18:13.426 --> 18:14.625
[laughter]
- like that.

18:14.627 --> 18:16.727
- A beautiful family.

18:16.729 --> 18:19.564
[laughter]

18:19.566 --> 18:22.166
- Right? Come on!

18:22.168 --> 18:24.202
Yeah, maybe
I'll never be manager,

18:24.204 --> 18:28.272
But I just managed to get
our most stubborn salesman

18:28.274 --> 18:30.675
To close a sale
with one of our biggest clients,

18:30.677 --> 18:33.845
And I must say it's the most
pleasant I've ever seen stanley.

18:33.847 --> 18:35.546
I think we should
consider injecting him

18:35.548 --> 18:37.615
With bull tranquilizer
on a daily basis.

18:37.617 --> 18:40.818
- So what can you do?

18:40.820 --> 18:43.721
- [australian accent]
well, what can't I do?

18:43.723 --> 18:45.823
Right? I can sing,

18:45.825 --> 18:49.794
I can play the banjo,
innit?

18:49.796 --> 18:51.796
And if you hadn't noticed,

18:51.798 --> 18:54.632
I've got a pretty good
british accent.

18:54.634 --> 18:56.534
- Can you drive a car?

18:56.536 --> 18:57.735
- At the risk
of sounding arrogant,

18:57.737 --> 18:59.670
I did drive myself here.

18:59.672 --> 19:03.741
A high school musical
here on your resume?

19:03.743 --> 19:06.244
What are you,
like, 40? 45?

19:06.246 --> 19:08.379
- My exact age is 28 to 34,

19:08.381 --> 19:09.680
So basically
just send me out

19:09.682 --> 19:11.716
On whatever jake gyllenhaal's
going out on.

19:11.718 --> 19:14.752
- Gyllenhaal, got it.

19:14.754 --> 19:17.355
Can you juggle and crap?

19:17.357 --> 19:18.756
- Yes.

19:18.758 --> 19:20.791
And yes.
[chuckles]

19:20.793 --> 19:24.295
- Would you dress up
as, say, a birthday clown

19:24.297 --> 19:29.367
And go to a kid's party,
let them throw pies at ya?

19:29.369 --> 19:31.669
- Whereas that is not

19:31.671 --> 19:34.906
Why I have
entered show business,

19:34.908 --> 19:39.343
I do understand that
you have to build credibility.

19:39.345 --> 19:41.712
[sniffs]
I'm all for it.

19:41.714 --> 19:43.648
- Well, mr. Bernard,
I'm gonna be honest with you.

19:43.650 --> 19:46.717
- Well, at least I tried.
Thank you very much.

19:46.719 --> 19:50.788
- No, we're--we're gonna
take you on as a client.

19:53.759 --> 19:56.494
- You are?

19:56.496 --> 19:58.729
Yes!

19:58.731 --> 20:01.666
Yes.

20:01.668 --> 20:03.768
Are you being
for real right now?

20:03.770 --> 20:05.203
Oh, man.

20:05.205 --> 20:06.671
Ah, yes!

20:06.673 --> 20:08.339
I need this so bad.

20:08.341 --> 20:12.410
I really think
this is what could fix me.

20:12.412 --> 20:16.480
- We are extremely excited to
be working with you too, sir.

20:17.816 --> 20:20.718
Pay todd on your way out.

20:20.720 --> 20:24.755
- Most talent agents take 10%
of whatever jobs they get you,

20:24.757 --> 20:28.392
But with carla
you pay a flat rate

20:28.394 --> 20:30.795
Of $5,000 up front.

20:30.797 --> 20:33.598
And that includes headshots.

20:33.600 --> 20:34.966
- Uh, it doesn't
include headshots.

20:34.968 --> 20:36.801
- It doesn't include headshots.
- No.

20:36.803 --> 20:39.770
- Well, of course not, because
that would be insane if it did.

20:39.772 --> 20:43.341
Still getting
a bargain, though.

20:46.311 --> 20:49.680
- So I just smiled
and complimented her grandkids,

20:49.682 --> 20:51.482
And we closed it?

20:51.484 --> 20:52.817
- You earned yourself
a nice, fat commission

20:52.819 --> 20:55.720
And you didn't even know it.

20:55.722 --> 20:58.556
I'll go tell andy
the good news.

20:58.558 --> 21:01.626
Oh. [chuckles] silly me.
Gotta take the stairs.

21:01.628 --> 21:03.461
- Oh, no,
I'm not doing that again.

21:03.463 --> 21:05.563
You got me down,
you gotta get me back up.

21:05.565 --> 21:07.632
- Well--no, no--n--

21:16.842 --> 21:19.010
We need a winch and a hoist.
