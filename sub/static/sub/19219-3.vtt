WEBVTT

00:01.044 --> 00:02.212
Previously on "The 100"...

00:02.629 --> 00:04.589
Luna, you're the
last of your kind,

00:04.798 --> 00:05.590
the last Nightblood.

00:05.799 --> 00:06.591
Will you take it
and become

00:06.800 --> 00:07.801
the next commander?

00:08.218 --> 00:08.843
No.

00:09.052 --> 00:11.554
We take people in
who are done fighting,

00:12.263 --> 00:13.640
done killing.

00:14.391 --> 00:16.309
Skaikru made me
murder my entire family.

00:16.935 --> 00:18.019
I have no one left.

00:18.395 --> 00:19.562
I'm sorry
for your loss,

00:19.938 --> 00:21.481
but the chip,
the technology,

00:21.690 --> 00:22.983
it affected
all of us.

00:23.191 --> 00:26.486
I, King Roan of Azgeda,
am caretaker of the throne,

00:27.195 --> 00:29.280
and keeper of the flame.

00:31.491 --> 00:33.034
The flame won't keep
the clans at bay forever.

00:33.243 --> 00:34.327
If they unite against us--

00:34.536 --> 00:35.495
they come
for Skaikru.

00:35.704 --> 00:37.497
And the radiation
comes for us all.

00:37.706 --> 00:39.165
Aah!

00:39.374 --> 00:41.334
We have to focus
on riding out the radiation,

00:41.543 --> 00:42.961
finding
someplace safe.

00:43.169 --> 00:44.337
That's it.

00:44.754 --> 00:47.173
We're standing
in our viable solution.

00:47.465 --> 00:48.717
How many of us will
the ship sustain

00:48.925 --> 00:50.301
without a
hydro-generator?

00:50.719 --> 00:51.928
No more than a hundred.

01:00.937 --> 01:03.023
Two meals a day for people
working as hard as ours,

01:03.565 --> 01:04.733
we won't make
any friends.

01:04.941 --> 01:05.650
Well, if there's
one thing

01:05.859 --> 01:07.527
our people understand,
it's rationing.

01:07.986 --> 01:09.529
Besides, once we
close those doors,

01:10.113 --> 01:12.073
it'll be one meal a day
for the next 5 years.

01:12.615 --> 01:14.534
Try one meal
every other day.

01:15.744 --> 01:17.954
Hunting parties are coming
back with less and less.

01:18.788 --> 01:19.914
Thanks to
your friend Niylah,

01:20.331 --> 01:21.249
we're preserving
more meat than ever,

01:21.458 --> 01:22.751
but it's still
not enough.

01:22.959 --> 01:24.544
Without a way to make water,
growing our own protein

01:24.753 --> 01:26.421
like we did on the ark
is not an option.

01:27.797 --> 01:29.299
Remember that
when we're starving.

01:30.550 --> 01:31.801
I won't be starving

01:32.010 --> 01:33.970
because I won't
be inside.

01:34.471 --> 01:35.597
Yes, you will.

01:36.556 --> 01:37.849
Does that mean
you made the list?

01:38.808 --> 01:41.227
No. What about
drinking water?

01:41.436 --> 01:43.104
Clarke, don't
change the subject.

01:43.313 --> 01:44.522
We need to know who's
gonna be on the inside

01:44.731 --> 01:46.524
of these doors when
the radiation comes.

01:46.733 --> 01:48.610
We don't need
to know now.

01:48.818 --> 01:50.487
We need some
medical help at the front gate.

01:50.695 --> 01:52.864
Looks like we got
some sick people there.

01:54.324 --> 01:57.243
Do not come
any closer.

01:58.328 --> 02:01.456
Please. They need
Skaikru medicine.

02:01.664 --> 02:03.249
Move.
Stand back.

02:07.128 --> 02:08.463
Nyko.

02:09.547 --> 02:10.548
What if it's
a grounder attack

02:10.757 --> 02:12.675
like they
did with Murphy?

02:12.884 --> 02:13.885
What happened
to them?

02:14.094 --> 02:15.011
The sickness.

02:15.220 --> 02:16.971
We lost more than 40
on the way.

02:21.684 --> 02:22.727
Luna?

02:25.647 --> 02:28.858
Please don't turn us away
because of what I did to you.

02:31.027 --> 02:33.822
Out of my way.
Please let me through.

02:48.378 --> 02:51.172
Mom, what is this?

02:53.091 --> 02:56.803
Fever, lesions,
vomiting.

02:57.595 --> 02:59.556
- It's Ars.
- What's Ars?

02:59.764 --> 03:02.142
Acute radiation
sickness.

03:08.273 --> 03:10.066
When did the
symptoms start?

03:10.275 --> 03:11.651
Not sure.

03:12.068 --> 03:13.611
Right before the fish
started dying.

03:13.945 --> 03:14.946
The fish are dying?

03:15.155 --> 03:16.781
Floating on the sea
to the horizon

03:17.282 --> 03:18.908
in every direction.

03:20.160 --> 03:22.620
It's not contagious.
Let's get them to Medbay.

03:23.246 --> 03:25.206
- Come on.
- Uh, uh...

03:25.415 --> 03:26.249
Come on.

03:29.919 --> 03:33.006
I got you. OK.
All right. There you go.

03:36.467 --> 03:37.677
It's already here.

04:22.388 --> 04:24.349
It's not safe for you here.
What do you want?

04:24.641 --> 04:26.226
I need you to handle
something for me

04:26.517 --> 04:28.353
the way you handled
ambassador Rafel.

04:32.190 --> 04:33.858
We should
speak alone.

04:34.901 --> 04:36.110
If you can't
trust Indra,

04:36.319 --> 04:38.238
you
can't trust me.

04:45.411 --> 04:47.205
The flame's
been stolen.

04:47.413 --> 04:49.540
How? When?

04:49.749 --> 04:51.459
Just now from
my quarters

04:51.668 --> 04:52.585
while
I was training.

04:52.794 --> 04:54.128
How can you be
so careless?

04:54.337 --> 04:55.505
We need to
lock down this city

04:55.713 --> 04:56.923
and search
everyone.

04:57.840 --> 04:59.175
We can't.

05:01.302 --> 05:03.471
If word gets out
that he's lost the flame,

05:04.013 --> 05:06.307
the other clans will
question his rule,

05:06.808 --> 05:08.226
Trikru
loudest of all.

05:08.434 --> 05:11.271
Then I'll be forced to answer
their questions with my army.

05:12.313 --> 05:15.525
Or we can just find it.
Where do I start?

05:16.025 --> 05:17.318
Whoever did
this got in and out

05:17.527 --> 05:19.279
of the tower
without being seen.

05:19.487 --> 05:21.406
In order to risk that,
she'd have to care more

05:21.614 --> 05:23.241
about the flame
than her own life.

05:23.616 --> 05:25.535
- "She"?
- The new Flamekeeper.

05:25.743 --> 05:27.370
Perhaps you
should look closer to home.

05:27.578 --> 05:29.080
You're not
exactly beloved.

05:29.289 --> 05:30.999
My people want
an ice nation king.

05:31.416 --> 05:32.333
The ambassadors
don't.

05:32.542 --> 05:33.543
The ambassadors
are cowards

05:33.751 --> 05:35.336
and know I'd have
their heads,

05:35.545 --> 05:38.214
the keepers of
the flame--fanatics.

05:41.217 --> 05:42.885
I'd do it myself,
but my guards

05:43.094 --> 05:44.345
won't let me
out of their sight.

05:51.853 --> 05:52.937
I'll handle it.

06:00.236 --> 06:01.362
What's wrong?

06:02.280 --> 06:03.823
You created
a killer.

06:04.032 --> 06:06.367
In the street, they're
calling her Skairipa,

06:06.576 --> 06:08.161
death from above.

06:08.369 --> 06:10.872
- I'm so proud.
- You should be.

06:11.581 --> 06:13.875
One kill to prevent
thousands,

06:14.083 --> 06:16.002
that's
good politics.

06:23.301 --> 06:25.345
You said there'd
be food here.

06:25.553 --> 06:26.721
There should be.

06:26.929 --> 06:28.723
These woods have always
been good to me.

06:31.309 --> 06:32.810
Now there's
not even bugs.

06:33.019 --> 06:34.228
Well, fortunately,
I'm not hungry enough

06:34.437 --> 06:36.022
for that to be
upsetting yet.

06:41.486 --> 06:43.821
I actually
kind of miss Polis.

06:44.864 --> 06:46.616
They had
this drink there--

06:47.784 --> 06:50.703
sweet, made out
of sheep's milk.

06:52.372 --> 06:53.831
Ontari gave this
to you?

06:57.293 --> 06:58.378
Yeah.

07:00.254 --> 07:01.839
I told you,
it wasn't all bad.

07:02.048 --> 07:04.050
You told me you were
trying to survive.

07:04.467 --> 07:05.385
I was.

07:05.593 --> 07:07.178
What else wasn't
bad, John, sex?

07:07.387 --> 07:09.972
Emori, I don't want
to talk about this.

07:10.431 --> 07:12.934
Fine.
Then let's not.

07:13.726 --> 07:15.728
I didn't have
a choice, OK?

07:15.937 --> 07:16.979
Emori...

07:20.441 --> 07:22.235
I didn't
have a choice.

07:35.415 --> 07:37.041
Where are you going?

07:37.417 --> 07:38.501
I'm gonna go
to Arkadia.

07:38.709 --> 07:40.420
What? Why?

07:40.920 --> 07:42.463
I'm a better thief
than I am a hunter.

07:42.672 --> 07:44.549
- I'll come with you.
- No.

07:45.091 --> 07:46.592
I'll draw less
attention alone.

07:53.349 --> 07:55.810
- Tonight we feast.
- OK.

08:01.357 --> 08:02.442
They're
getting worse.

08:02.650 --> 08:04.110
There's got to be
something we can do.

08:04.318 --> 08:05.611
Delactivene
might help,

08:05.820 --> 08:07.363
but Raven's got the meds
on lockdown.

08:07.572 --> 08:08.698
Leave Raven
to me.

08:08.906 --> 08:10.491
What, exactly,
do the tests show?

08:10.700 --> 08:12.660
The exposure is acute.

08:12.869 --> 08:15.329
Without treatment, there's
little to no chance of recovery.

08:15.496 --> 08:16.956
It looks like
the radiation is internal,

08:17.665 --> 08:18.958
ingested
from irradiated fish.

08:19.167 --> 08:19.917
None of
the outbreaks appear

08:20.126 --> 08:21.461
to be from
airborne exposure.

08:21.669 --> 08:23.671
- That's the good news.
- Not for them.

08:25.506 --> 08:28.217
You think I deserve this
for refusing the flame?

08:29.427 --> 08:31.179
No one deserves
to suffer.

08:32.096 --> 08:33.431
Besides, this would've
happened anyway.

08:33.639 --> 08:34.474
It's
worth a try.

08:38.186 --> 08:40.229
This is all
that's left of my people.

08:42.106 --> 08:43.441
Can you save them?

08:44.484 --> 08:46.152
We'll do
everything we can.

08:46.861 --> 08:48.112
You have my word.

08:52.116 --> 08:53.659
Tell me
something good.

08:54.368 --> 08:56.120
Raven's
looking for us.

09:00.833 --> 09:02.668
So Luna's rig is here,
and if the fish

09:02.877 --> 09:04.337
in these waters are dying,

09:05.338 --> 09:06.506
well, basically,
we're screwed.

09:06.714 --> 09:07.840
I don't understand.

09:08.049 --> 09:09.050
Alie said
we had 6 months.

09:09.258 --> 09:10.218
We don't.

09:10.426 --> 09:11.802
Well, then how long
do we have?

09:12.595 --> 09:13.971
It's hard to say.

09:14.639 --> 09:16.098
Radiation is dispersed
by jet stream

09:16.307 --> 09:17.225
and carried
by ocean currents,

09:17.433 --> 09:18.809
so it's not
an exact science,

09:19.018 --> 09:21.437
but the leading indicators
are small species die-offs--

09:21.646 --> 09:22.980
fish, insects.

09:23.606 --> 09:25.900
Based on the new data,
I'd say we have...

09:27.944 --> 09:29.487
Two months
of survivability...

09:31.447 --> 09:32.406
Maybe less.

09:32.615 --> 09:34.116
The ark
won't be ready.

09:34.867 --> 09:35.785
It'll be close.

09:35.993 --> 09:37.745
If we triple the man hours
and work round the clock,

09:37.954 --> 09:39.372
we should be able
to achieve a hard seal

09:39.580 --> 09:40.998
before the black
rain comes.

09:41.832 --> 09:43.668
We just have to decide
who gets to live here.

09:44.293 --> 09:45.836
Raven, we're not talking
about the list again.

09:46.045 --> 09:47.880
Clarke, we are
running out of time.

09:48.422 --> 09:50.758
We have to make a plan
for the day we close the doors,

09:50.967 --> 09:52.093
drill for it,
make sure

09:52.301 --> 09:53.636
only the survivors
have guns,

09:53.844 --> 09:55.471
agree on protocols
for dealing with the people

09:55.680 --> 09:57.431
who are pissed off
they're not chosen.

09:58.933 --> 10:01.602
You asked me
to be in charge of rationing,

10:01.811 --> 10:03.604
and I am doing it,
but choosing

10:03.813 --> 10:06.566
who gets to live or die
is your specialty.

10:11.153 --> 10:12.655
No one's scheduled
to take the rover.

10:20.454 --> 10:22.081
Out of the vehicle.

10:23.124 --> 10:23.791
I need
to make a run.

10:24.000 --> 10:25.793
All supply runs
go through me,

10:26.377 --> 10:27.044
and shouldn't you
be working

10:27.253 --> 10:28.963
on the patch
to sector 5?

10:35.428 --> 10:38.097
A patch
for a ship

10:38.306 --> 10:40.766
that can only save
a hundred people?

10:41.684 --> 10:43.185
Why are you
surprised?

10:43.894 --> 10:45.062
I am an engineer.

10:45.271 --> 10:47.023
We have no way
to generate water.

10:47.440 --> 10:49.400
The harder number
is 400.

10:50.026 --> 10:52.028
Can you really
sentence 400 more

10:52.236 --> 10:53.070
of our own people
to death?

10:53.279 --> 10:55.072
We don't
have a choice.

11:01.162 --> 11:03.080
What if you do?

11:03.289 --> 11:06.959
What if I told you there
might be a fallout shelter

11:07.168 --> 11:09.378
less than a day's
drive from here,

11:10.046 --> 11:13.215
a fallout shelter built
to sustain thousands?

11:13.591 --> 11:14.967
We've been through
the chancellor's files.

11:15.176 --> 11:16.844
All the bunkers you considered
for the hundred

11:17.053 --> 11:19.722
were listed
as compromised or unviable,

11:20.014 --> 11:21.432
and now
mount weather is, too.

11:22.016 --> 11:23.893
Those were
government bunkers.

11:30.524 --> 11:32.485
A doomsday cult?

11:32.693 --> 11:34.487
That's right--
the second dawn.

11:34.695 --> 11:35.946
They built a bunker?

11:36.155 --> 11:37.740
Their whole theology
was based on riding out

11:37.948 --> 11:39.033
the end
of the world.

11:41.243 --> 11:42.620
And why didn't you
consider it?

11:42.828 --> 11:43.913
We couldn't prove
it existed.

11:44.121 --> 11:45.498
So why are you
considering it now?

11:45.706 --> 11:49.502
Because before now,
we didn't need it.

11:51.045 --> 11:52.254
You found it,
didn't you?

11:55.049 --> 11:56.676
We can't be sure
unless we check it out.

12:00.554 --> 12:02.807
No. No way.

12:03.182 --> 12:04.266
We need that rover
for hauling pieces

12:04.475 --> 12:05.851
of a 3-ton patch
we're build--

12:06.060 --> 12:08.354
yeah, but if he's right,
we don't need a patch.

12:09.105 --> 12:10.815
Can I talk to you guys
for a second?

12:14.527 --> 12:15.736
Can you
please remind Clarke

12:15.945 --> 12:17.321
what happened
the last time Jaha

12:17.530 --> 12:18.739
went looking
for salvation?

12:18.948 --> 12:20.783
Raven, if that
bunker is real,

12:21.409 --> 12:23.411
we can save a lot more
than a hundred people.

12:23.994 --> 12:26.706
If it's not,
we've lost another day.

12:27.623 --> 12:30.167
Hey, look. If it's not,
I'll make the list...

12:32.420 --> 12:33.337
OK?

12:37.049 --> 12:40.177
Oh, do what you want.
I've got a ship to seal.

12:44.807 --> 12:46.100
I'll drive.

12:56.402 --> 12:58.279
The end is coming.

13:00.156 --> 13:02.491
Hear me as I say it this time.

13:03.200 --> 13:06.829
The end is coming,
and it's coming soon.

13:07.037 --> 13:08.998
He gave this speech
two weeks before the bombs.

13:09.415 --> 13:12.042
The world is dark
and getting darker all the time.

13:12.251 --> 13:14.336
Everything we once trusted
has turned on us--

13:14.545 --> 13:15.921
government, religion.

13:16.130 --> 13:19.884
Even technology has become
a weapon in their hands

13:20.092 --> 13:22.052
used to poison our minds.

13:23.137 --> 13:24.388
I know you're in pain.

13:24.597 --> 13:27.808
I know you're afraid, but it
doesn't have to be like this.

13:28.476 --> 13:30.853
There is a way
out of the darkness.

13:31.061 --> 13:34.607
I can show it to you.
You can be saved.

13:36.025 --> 13:37.234
Join me.

13:37.735 --> 13:41.447
Join us, and together
when the horsemen come,

13:42.698 --> 13:44.492
from the ashes, we will rise.

13:47.203 --> 13:49.455
Please tell me you
have more than this.

13:51.207 --> 13:52.792
In the two years
before the bombs,

13:53.000 --> 13:54.418
Cadogan sold off most

13:54.627 --> 13:56.504
of the second dawn's
real estate holdings,

13:56.712 --> 13:58.923
generating tens
of millions of dollars,

13:59.131 --> 14:03.052
but there was one thing
he didn't sell.

14:06.055 --> 14:07.890
I found this
in his autobiography.

14:08.098 --> 14:09.266
It's his childhood home.

14:09.475 --> 14:11.769
His father build a bunker there
to save his family.

14:12.102 --> 14:15.815
I think Cadogan used
the church's money to expand it.

14:16.941 --> 14:17.650
Grew up there.

14:17.858 --> 14:19.902
Maybe he kept it for
sentimental value.

14:20.110 --> 14:23.364
Hmm. His father beat him
almost daily in that house.

14:23.989 --> 14:25.157
He hated living there.

14:25.366 --> 14:27.701
Why keep it if you're
liquidating everything else?

14:27.910 --> 14:31.580
Because that bunker is there.
I can feel it.

14:31.789 --> 14:34.375
Guy sounds like a
religious fanatic to me.

14:35.918 --> 14:38.963
Maybe, or maybe
he was just a leader

14:39.171 --> 14:41.799
willing to do whatever it took
to save his people.

14:55.646 --> 14:56.939
Look who's back.

14:57.147 --> 15:00.025
Thought you ran off
with your...Girlfriend.

15:00.734 --> 15:02.027
You jealous,
Miller?

15:02.236 --> 15:03.571
There's enough
of me to go around.

15:03.779 --> 15:06.240
Of course, Bryan would
probably kick my ass, so--

15:07.533 --> 15:08.993
You here
to stay, John?

15:09.201 --> 15:10.786
Till something better
comes along, yeah.

15:15.124 --> 15:16.417
Close the gate.

15:18.085 --> 15:19.962
All right.
Start it up.

15:44.862 --> 15:47.323
Already told Jackson,
we can't spare anything,

15:48.407 --> 15:50.117
especially not
antiradiation meds.

15:50.326 --> 15:51.744
We're talking
about 7 doses.

15:51.952 --> 15:53.495
That's a quarter
of our supply, Abby,

15:53.704 --> 15:56.248
a supply that has
to last us for 5 years

15:56.457 --> 15:57.833
on an irradiated
planet.

15:58.667 --> 16:00.002
We're gonna need
every one of those pills,

16:00.210 --> 16:01.378
and you know it.

16:01.587 --> 16:02.421
You're right.

16:02.630 --> 16:04.423
We put you in charge
of the supplies.

16:04.632 --> 16:06.634
It's your call,
but those people--

16:06.842 --> 16:08.636
will it work?

16:12.848 --> 16:16.810
Can you guarantee
the medicine will save them?

16:19.521 --> 16:20.898
You can't

16:21.774 --> 16:23.233
because Delactivene
needs to be used

16:23.442 --> 16:25.569
within 24 hours
of exposure.

16:27.696 --> 16:29.114
It's on
the damn label.

16:29.865 --> 16:31.325
The rate of
effectiveness goes down,

16:31.533 --> 16:35.913
yes, but it doesn't
mean it won't work.

16:37.122 --> 16:40.125
- We have to try.
- No.

16:40.793 --> 16:42.795
There's a child
in there with them.

16:44.088 --> 16:46.799
At least give me
enough for her.

16:47.007 --> 16:49.093
I'm sorry, but we
can't waste our supply

16:49.301 --> 16:50.511
on a long shot.

16:50.719 --> 16:53.013
If we can save
one life,

16:53.222 --> 16:55.307
would you
call that a waste?

16:55.516 --> 17:00.646
Even if it worked, even if
we could save them today,

17:01.730 --> 17:05.234
they'll be dead from
radiation inside two months.

17:08.821 --> 17:11.031
You tell yourself
that if you need to,

17:12.574 --> 17:14.743
but the radiation isn't
killing that child.

17:16.036 --> 17:16.954
You are.

18:02.458 --> 18:04.001
You looking
for these?

18:08.213 --> 18:10.716
Where did you g--
never mind.

18:10.924 --> 18:11.925
I didn't know
how many you needed,

18:12.134 --> 18:13.510
so I took it all.

18:14.970 --> 18:17.639
What are you waiting for?
Go. Be doctors.

18:19.058 --> 18:20.100
Give it to
the child first,

18:20.684 --> 18:21.727
and if it works,

18:21.935 --> 18:23.353
you give it
to the others.

18:30.944 --> 18:33.781
I'm glad you're back, John.
I was worried about you.

18:34.865 --> 18:36.033
Thanks.

18:39.828 --> 18:41.413
OK.

18:41.622 --> 18:45.709
It's OK. OK?
It's OK.

18:50.380 --> 18:52.257
Adria...

18:55.010 --> 18:56.220
It's OK.

19:00.933 --> 19:02.601
You can trust them.

19:06.814 --> 19:07.815
It's like food.

19:08.023 --> 19:09.024
Just put it
in your mouth

19:09.233 --> 19:10.484
and take it down
with the water.

19:13.278 --> 19:16.824
There you go.
That's it.

19:19.159 --> 19:21.370
Easy, easy. OK.

19:21.912 --> 19:23.413
I got you.
I got you.

19:25.374 --> 19:26.250
What about
the others?

19:26.458 --> 19:28.836
We'll monitor Adria closely
for the next few hours.

19:29.044 --> 19:32.631
If her symptoms improve,
then we'll treat the adults.

19:33.549 --> 19:35.300
Thank you.

19:52.401 --> 19:53.443
His father
got floated

19:53.652 --> 19:55.571
for stealing medicine
to save him.

19:57.322 --> 19:58.907
Who knew
he had it in him?

20:00.033 --> 20:01.201
I did.

20:42.034 --> 20:43.660
Hey, no, no, no.

20:51.585 --> 20:52.586
What's the point?

20:52.794 --> 20:54.129
Alie used tech
to control us.

20:54.338 --> 20:56.215
No one'll ever take over
our minds again.

21:21.240 --> 21:23.158
So you're
the new Flamekeeper.

21:23.992 --> 21:27.579
This is a sacred space.
Leave before you get hurt.

21:27.871 --> 21:29.456
Give me the flame.

21:31.083 --> 21:32.459
It does not
belong to you

21:32.668 --> 21:35.003
or your
red-blooded king.

21:36.255 --> 21:37.965
I can't let you
leave with it.

21:38.382 --> 21:39.967
You don't
have a choice.

21:46.056 --> 21:46.974
Ah!

21:48.392 --> 21:51.311
Good technique.
I know it well.

21:55.941 --> 21:57.317
Uh! Yah!

21:58.277 --> 22:00.904
Stop.
Put down the sword, Octavia.

22:01.113 --> 22:04.283
- She has the flame.
- She's my daughter.

22:19.756 --> 22:20.924
I'll talk to Roan.

22:21.133 --> 22:22.426
If we give him
back the flame,

22:22.634 --> 22:24.011
I can convince him
to show mercy.

22:24.219 --> 22:26.513
Azgeda knows
no mercy.

22:29.433 --> 22:31.059
Give me the flame,
gaia.

22:32.477 --> 22:33.895
It's around
her neck.

22:34.104 --> 22:36.189
That's nothing,
a totem she's worn

22:36.398 --> 22:38.108
since she
joined the faith.

22:38.317 --> 22:41.320
You are interfering in matters
you do not understand.

22:41.528 --> 22:43.238
Wrong.
I'm a Flamekeeper.

22:43.447 --> 22:45.282
I'm honoring
my faith,

22:45.741 --> 22:47.200
a faith you once
believed in.

22:47.409 --> 22:49.161
Don't you question
my devotion.

22:49.369 --> 22:51.246
A devoted follower
would die

22:51.455 --> 22:53.707
before giving the flame
to an unworthy king,

22:54.124 --> 22:55.417
an Azgeda king.

22:55.625 --> 22:59.671
You pervert our faith.
Heda would be ashamed.

22:59.880 --> 23:02.007
I'm doing
what's best for Trikru.

23:02.215 --> 23:03.800
You would understand that
if you had stayed

23:04.009 --> 23:05.218
and done your duty.

23:05.427 --> 23:06.386
I was called.

23:06.595 --> 23:10.182
My daughter was not meant
to wander the earth

23:10.390 --> 23:12.225
looking for Nightbloods.

23:12.434 --> 23:15.395
My daughter
was meant to lead armies.

23:15.604 --> 23:19.024
My daughter was meant
to lead our people.

23:21.818 --> 23:23.653
Looks like you found
that daughter now.

23:23.862 --> 23:25.655
Roan sent me here
to kill you.

23:27.032 --> 23:28.158
If I don't come back
with the flame,

23:28.367 --> 23:29.284
he will send others.

23:29.493 --> 23:30.660
If the spirit
of the commanders

23:30.869 --> 23:34.373
deems it my time,
then so be it.

23:36.208 --> 23:37.417
Indra,

23:37.626 --> 23:39.961
tell me what you
want me to do here.

23:40.170 --> 23:42.381
Without the flame,
the king is vulnerable.

23:42.923 --> 23:45.717
We will need to fight to
keep him on the throne.

23:46.927 --> 23:48.512
If that's what you
want me to do,

23:48.720 --> 23:51.181
I'll do it for you.

23:51.848 --> 23:53.725
- I can run.
- He'll find you.

23:54.434 --> 23:56.186
Don't throw
your life away.

23:57.562 --> 23:59.731
That's what you said
the day I left.

24:01.733 --> 24:03.902
You still don't
understand.

24:06.071 --> 24:07.280
The looters.

24:07.489 --> 24:08.865
If they find the flame,
they'll destroy it.

24:12.953 --> 24:14.454
I'll take
the tunnel.

24:16.248 --> 24:16.873
Wait.

24:30.178 --> 24:31.555
Drop your weapons.

24:32.305 --> 24:33.723
You're making
a mistake.

24:33.932 --> 24:37.561
We just want the tech.
No one has to get hurt.

24:43.525 --> 24:45.527
Uh! No.

24:48.155 --> 24:49.030
Give me the pack.

24:49.239 --> 24:51.324
No. No. Let go.
Give that back.

24:53.452 --> 24:55.662
Don't. Uh...

25:02.794 --> 25:05.046
Please.
That's not tech.

25:05.297 --> 25:06.840
That's the spirit
of the commanders.

25:08.592 --> 25:11.219
Please. Ilian, you don't
have to do this.

25:11.970 --> 25:13.346
Yes, I do.

25:18.602 --> 25:21.062
- Yaah!
- Aah!

25:22.898 --> 25:23.815
Whoo!

25:41.458 --> 25:42.584
They're gone.

25:59.601 --> 26:00.393
Ohh...

26:08.568 --> 26:09.819
Sorry about
your necklace.

26:12.572 --> 26:15.825
Don't be.
That was a good plan.

26:17.244 --> 26:18.328
Thank you.

26:28.630 --> 26:29.923
You got what you wanted.

26:31.925 --> 26:33.552
So did you.

26:54.364 --> 26:56.324
Indra...

27:00.120 --> 27:01.997
She's family.

27:02.205 --> 27:04.499
Roan will still
want her head.

27:05.166 --> 27:06.710
Not if he doesn't
think it was her.

27:38.074 --> 27:38.992
Hey, hey, hey.

27:39.200 --> 27:40.035
What the hell
are you doing here?

27:40.243 --> 27:41.828
Now is not
a really good time.

27:49.294 --> 27:50.920
Once a cockroach,
always a cockroach, huh?

27:51.129 --> 27:52.797
Seriously, Raven,
not now.

27:53.006 --> 27:54.132
Oh...

27:57.177 --> 27:59.137
We only wasted
one dose.

29:20.593 --> 29:21.594
Ohh...

29:23.930 --> 29:26.433
Ohh...Ohh...

29:56.838 --> 29:59.132
Cadogan learned how to
survive from his father.

30:00.091 --> 30:02.677
They hunted
in these woods.

30:09.058 --> 30:10.643
Huh.

30:11.853 --> 30:13.021
This is it.

30:13.229 --> 30:15.857
Well, if anyone's entitled
to a lucky break, we are.

30:17.275 --> 30:19.068
You hear that?

30:22.322 --> 30:23.406
No insects.

30:25.867 --> 30:26.826
What?

30:27.035 --> 30:29.078
Luna said the fish
were dying.

30:30.413 --> 30:31.623
What are the things
that eat the fish

30:31.831 --> 30:33.833
and bugs
gonna eat now?

30:35.794 --> 30:38.630
What happened to us
deserving a lucky break?

30:43.843 --> 30:45.178
So what are we
looking for?

30:45.553 --> 30:47.806
The bunker would have been
at the lowest point.

30:48.014 --> 30:50.642
Anything structural.
Be careful.

30:51.726 --> 30:52.852
She's lucky
to have you.

30:53.269 --> 30:54.771
Leadership
is a lonely pursuit,

30:54.979 --> 30:58.441
but you--you
keep her centered.

31:00.360 --> 31:01.945
You got it
backwards.

31:03.154 --> 31:05.281
Still blaming yourself
for killing that army.

31:07.575 --> 31:08.785
You made mistakes--
it's true--

31:08.993 --> 31:11.079
but your intentions
were pure.

31:11.287 --> 31:13.581
Every choice you made you
made to save your people...

31:15.667 --> 31:19.003
Even shooting me
twice.

31:19.212 --> 31:21.673
As long as that's the truth,
you don't need redemption.

31:22.590 --> 31:24.968
- You better hope so.
- What's that?

31:25.176 --> 31:28.513
Well, if you're wrong
and there is a hell,

31:30.223 --> 31:32.392
then I guess
I'll see you there.

31:32.892 --> 31:34.102
How many people
do you have to save

31:34.310 --> 31:35.895
before you
forgive yourself?

31:37.730 --> 31:39.065
Over here.

31:46.531 --> 31:49.158
Huh. Stay behind me.

31:58.543 --> 31:59.752
Watch your head.

32:02.380 --> 32:03.548
OK.

32:37.290 --> 32:39.500
"From the ashes,
we will rise."

32:41.502 --> 32:43.463
Not this guy. Hmm.

32:48.259 --> 32:50.428
The 11th seal.

32:50.637 --> 32:52.472
Their faith was based
on 12 seals.

32:52.680 --> 32:53.765
Followers
could level up

32:53.973 --> 32:55.934
by unlocking them
one at a time.

32:56.142 --> 32:58.603
Only those
who reached level 12

32:59.187 --> 33:00.855
could achieve
salvation.

33:02.190 --> 33:05.193
Huh. Maybe that's
why they didn't let him in.

33:07.320 --> 33:08.321
I was right.

33:10.949 --> 33:13.117
What if they're
still in here?

33:17.622 --> 33:20.083
Hey! Is anyone there?

33:29.133 --> 33:30.843
It's still sealed.

33:31.719 --> 33:33.805
There's no locks,
no handles.

33:34.305 --> 33:37.100
That's because it was designed
to be opened from inside.

33:38.059 --> 33:41.688
Or from the outside
by somebody with a rover.

34:07.422 --> 34:08.381
What happened?

34:09.132 --> 34:10.425
Let's go find out.

34:19.058 --> 34:20.143
It worked.

34:21.310 --> 34:22.311
Huh.

34:38.286 --> 34:39.662
This can't be.

34:48.171 --> 34:49.589
It wasn't sealed.

34:49.797 --> 34:52.383
The radiation would have
killed them in days.

34:52.592 --> 34:54.427
This won't
save anyone.

35:07.648 --> 35:08.816
Leave us.

35:23.039 --> 35:24.749
He was one
of the looters.

35:25.208 --> 35:27.460
You were wrong
about the Flamekeeper.

35:30.421 --> 35:32.381
And the flame?

35:37.345 --> 35:40.973
Destroyed before
I could kill him.

35:42.266 --> 35:43.267
I'm sorry.

35:50.483 --> 35:52.527
It'll be more
dangerous now.

35:52.860 --> 35:55.696
More people will have to
die to keep me in power,

35:57.406 --> 35:59.075
not that
that bothers you,

36:00.827 --> 36:02.203
Skairipa.

36:03.579 --> 36:05.581
People fell in line
behind the flame.

36:06.040 --> 36:07.917
Now they'll fall
in line behind the sword.

36:08.626 --> 36:09.585
Let's hope Clarke
finds a way

36:09.794 --> 36:11.712
to save us
before they have to.

36:13.923 --> 36:14.841
Get out.

36:21.931 --> 36:23.683
Oh, finally.

36:25.560 --> 36:26.727
Emori.

36:35.153 --> 36:37.947
John, what's wrong?

36:39.615 --> 36:42.118
It looks like we may need
my people, after all.

36:42.326 --> 36:43.494
There's a storm coming.

36:43.703 --> 36:44.579
When it hits,
we need to be

36:44.787 --> 36:46.122
on the right side
of that door.

36:46.330 --> 36:50.251
So we make
ourselves useful.

36:50.918 --> 36:52.753
Yeah. Yeah, exactly.

36:53.504 --> 36:54.839
I've already started
working on Abby.

36:55.047 --> 36:57.008
Come on.
I'll explain on the way.

38:04.951 --> 38:06.953
Mm...

38:13.960 --> 38:16.879
If I'm on that list,
you're on that list.

38:17.296 --> 38:20.883
- Bellamy, I can't.
- Write it down.

38:22.009 --> 38:24.345
Write it down,
or I will.

38:48.995 --> 38:50.204
So what now?

38:52.665 --> 38:55.835
Now we put it away and hope
we never have to use it.

38:56.502 --> 38:58.296
You still have hope?

38:59.171 --> 39:00.798
We still breathing?

39:12.435 --> 39:13.811
Get some sleep.

40:09.075 --> 40:10.076
Luna?

40:24.924 --> 40:26.217
Impossible.

40:33.766 --> 40:35.434
We didn't treat her.

40:38.479 --> 40:39.730
Your fever's down.

40:41.148 --> 40:41.899
How?

40:42.108 --> 40:44.860
Her body's rejecting
the radiation on its own.

40:47.029 --> 40:49.865
Here.
Please sit down.

40:52.827 --> 40:54.703
I'd like to run
some tests.

40:56.831 --> 40:57.665
Jackson.

41:02.503 --> 41:03.587
What did you do?

41:04.213 --> 41:06.715
Nothing.
There's only one variable.

41:07.425 --> 41:10.511
There's one thing that separates
Luna from the others.

41:14.640 --> 41:16.267
Nightblood.

41:23.065 --> 41:25.192
From the ashes,
we will rise.
