WEBVTT

00:00.001 --> 00:03.402
Toby, this is insane.
You could get seriously hurt.

00:03.404 --> 00:05.036
We've done some crazy stuff,

00:05.038 --> 00:06.370
but this is nuttier
than squirrel poop.

00:06.372 --> 00:08.372
He'll pull it off.
We have a plan.

00:08.374 --> 00:10.207
I found six "D" batteries.
I'll put 'em in.

00:10.209 --> 00:11.675
Tell him this is
too dangerous.

00:11.677 --> 00:14.210
Actually, I kind of want
to see how this plays out.

00:14.212 --> 00:15.177
When did you get here?

00:15.179 --> 00:16.278
I'm Ray.

00:16.280 --> 00:17.345
I'm always here.

00:17.780 --> 00:18.712
It should work now.

00:18.714 --> 00:19.479
It's time.

00:19.481 --> 00:20.363
TOBY:
Okay.

00:20.364 --> 00:21.246
Someone push the button.

00:29.624 --> 00:31.390
(click)

00:31.392 --> 00:33.458
♪ ♪

00:51.311 --> 00:52.743
Whew.

00:52.745 --> 00:53.744
(music shuts off)

00:53.746 --> 00:55.345
That was getting kind of heavy.

00:56.414 --> 00:58.147
This was a mistake.
Be careful.

00:58.149 --> 01:00.249
All you have to offer society
is your mind,

01:00.251 --> 01:02.451
so let him work your... body.

01:04.221 --> 01:05.386
CABE:  All right,
let's go, killer.

01:08.324 --> 01:10.223
Here we go!

01:10.225 --> 01:11.390
Where the hell you think
you're going?

01:11.392 --> 01:13.392
I'm the-the cut man.

01:15.763 --> 01:17.395
I can squirt water
in his mouth.

01:18.197 --> 01:19.763
Yes!

01:21.133 --> 01:22.332
I'm the cut man!

01:23.435 --> 01:25.067
Not now.

01:25.069 --> 01:26.768
In the blue corner,

01:26.770 --> 01:29.604
weighing in at 171 pounds,

01:29.606 --> 01:32.239
from Hawaiian Gardens,

01:32.241 --> 01:34.474
Hector Guardino...

01:34.476 --> 01:36.476
(audience cheering)

01:36.478 --> 01:39.312
In the red corner,

01:39.314 --> 01:41.547
at 168 pounds,

01:41.549 --> 01:44.750
from MIT undergrad
and Harvard Medical School--

01:44.752 --> 01:48.186
he's got more degrees
than a thermometer,

01:48.188 --> 01:49.720
more knockout punches than a...

01:49.722 --> 01:51.455
Seriously?

01:51.457 --> 01:52.656
Just read the card, zebra.

01:54.793 --> 01:56.125
More knockout punches

01:56.127 --> 01:58.193
than a frat house
refreshment table:

01:58.195 --> 02:00.161
the Doctor of Doom,

02:00.163 --> 02:02.263
the Head-Hunting Headshrink,

02:02.265 --> 02:04.231
the Therapist with a Hit List,

02:04.233 --> 02:07.601
Dr. Tobias Curtis...

02:07.603 --> 02:10.870
(audience jeering)

02:10.872 --> 02:13.305
(whoops)

02:13.307 --> 02:15.307
Can't believe Happy
didn't make it.

02:15.309 --> 02:16.541
Just focus
on the fight.

02:16.543 --> 02:18.476
Once again,
what's our plan?

02:18.478 --> 02:20.444
I profiled my opponent
online last night.

02:20.446 --> 02:22.379
I know a ton about him.
I'm gonna get in his head.

02:22.381 --> 02:23.430
That is not the plan!

02:23.431 --> 02:24.480
Stick and move,
that's the plan!

02:24.483 --> 02:25.548
Stick and move!

02:26.617 --> 02:28.383
(growls)

02:28.385 --> 02:29.384
CABE:
Stick and move!

02:29.386 --> 02:31.486
(bell clangs)

02:35.325 --> 02:36.357
Keep your feet
under you!

02:36.359 --> 02:38.258
Keep your feet
under you!

02:38.260 --> 02:39.792
You're the reason
your parents got divorced

02:39.794 --> 02:40.793
when you were eight.

02:40.795 --> 02:42.227
(grunts)

02:43.630 --> 02:44.762
Oh, yeah, yeah!

02:46.198 --> 02:47.797
Uh-oh. Uh-oh.

02:47.799 --> 02:48.831
Maybe I crossed a line.

02:50.301 --> 02:52.634
Oh! Oh!

02:52.636 --> 02:54.302
(audience cheering)

02:54.304 --> 02:55.803
One... two...
All right, get up.

02:55.805 --> 02:57.237
three...

02:57.239 --> 02:59.272
Get up, Doc!
four...

02:59.274 --> 03:00.373
five...

03:00.375 --> 03:01.607

seven...

SYLVESTER:
Okay...

03:07.413 --> 03:08.612
Here we go.

03:12.451 --> 03:13.450
That's cold.

03:13.452 --> 03:14.784
It's liquid nitrogen.

03:14.786 --> 03:15.785
It should be cold.

03:15.787 --> 03:18.387
12 hours, still swollen.

03:18.389 --> 03:20.322
I hope you've got that boxing
nonsense out of your system.

03:20.324 --> 03:21.656
TOBY:
One more fight.

03:21.658 --> 03:23.257
Just need Happy to see me

03:23.259 --> 03:25.359
in a more manly,
less academic light.

03:25.361 --> 03:27.294
You want more manly?
Lose the hat, already.

03:27.296 --> 03:28.762
And if Happy

03:28.764 --> 03:30.263
were interested in you,
she would have been there.

03:30.265 --> 03:32.298
(door opens)
Sorry.

03:32.300 --> 03:35.301
Sometimes the truth hurts
more than a right hook, buddy.

03:35.303 --> 03:37.403
HAPPY:
Guys?

03:37.405 --> 03:38.670
SYLVESTER:
Morning!

03:40.306 --> 03:41.204
What happened to you?

03:41.206 --> 03:42.305
I had my first fight

03:42.307 --> 03:43.306
yesterday evening.

03:43.308 --> 03:44.307
You missed it.

03:44.309 --> 03:46.275
Right. Uh, sorry.

03:46.277 --> 03:47.542
I had a prior engagement.

03:47.544 --> 03:49.744
How did it go?

03:49.746 --> 03:51.579
You should've seen
the other guy.

03:51.581 --> 03:53.480
WALTER: Oh, yeah, he
was standing over Toby

03:53.482 --> 03:55.415
with his arms raised in triumph.

03:55.417 --> 03:58.418
Yeah, well, hopefully
I'll be there

03:58.420 --> 03:59.786
the next time
somebody hits you.

04:04.291 --> 04:05.423
See that?

04:05.425 --> 04:06.457
She was just busy.

04:06.459 --> 04:09.426
First stage of grief: denial.

04:09.428 --> 04:10.560
Grief over what?

04:10.562 --> 04:11.827
The fact that
your attempted romance

04:11.829 --> 04:13.395
with Happy is dead.

04:13.397 --> 04:14.462
Okay, no offense,

04:14.464 --> 04:15.863
but I'm not about
to give weight

04:15.865 --> 04:17.264
to the psychiatric
musings

04:17.266 --> 04:19.332
of a guy who uses
a superhero lunch box

04:19.334 --> 04:20.599
and someone who
still watches<i> Bonanza.</i>

04:23.403 --> 04:26.404
Second stage of grief: anger.

04:26.406 --> 04:28.572
RAY:
Wally!

04:28.574 --> 04:30.273
<i> Uno momento s'il vous plait?</i>

04:30.275 --> 04:31.407
Yeah.

04:36.580 --> 04:37.645
Wow.

04:37.647 --> 04:38.779
Today is your
lucky day, brosef.

04:38.781 --> 04:40.280
I'm taking you to
the beach with me.

04:40.282 --> 04:42.715
Sit in traffic for hours

04:42.717 --> 04:43.982
just to lie on dirt
next to water?

04:43.984 --> 04:44.983
Come on!

04:44.985 --> 04:46.384
The beach is fun.

04:46.386 --> 04:48.753
Girls, waves, horseshoe crabs...

04:50.923 --> 04:52.756
Hey, hey.
Don't-don't touch that.

04:52.758 --> 04:54.290
Put that down.

04:54.292 --> 04:55.724
Yeah, o-okay.
Sorry.

04:55.726 --> 04:58.259
I just...
I... saw it there.

04:58.261 --> 05:00.728
It's cool. It's just...
Okay.

05:00.730 --> 05:01.995
it's not mine, okay?

05:01.997 --> 05:03.763
Yeah.

05:06.968 --> 05:08.767
You know, Paige said that
you used to be a firefighter.

05:08.769 --> 05:09.868
Is that a bravery award?

05:09.870 --> 05:12.503
Not for me.

05:15.374 --> 05:17.407
Anyway, why are we
talking about the past

05:17.409 --> 05:18.908
when the present is so tasty?

05:18.910 --> 05:20.809
So get your junk in some trunks,
all right?

05:20.811 --> 05:21.810
We are outta here
like Vladimir.

05:21.812 --> 05:22.877
Come on.

05:22.879 --> 05:24.578
Oh, no, I can't.

05:24.580 --> 05:25.845
I have, uh, plans.

05:25.847 --> 05:27.379
Oh, that's right.

05:27.381 --> 05:28.546
Paula's kid invited you
to the science museum.

05:28.548 --> 05:29.547
I forgot.
It's Paige.

05:29.549 --> 05:30.681
And I couldn't go.

05:30.683 --> 05:32.015
Making too much rocket progress.

05:32.017 --> 05:33.282
Hold on a second.

05:33.284 --> 05:34.500
You could've spent
your Saturday

05:34.501 --> 05:35.717
hanging out with
a beautiful woman,

05:35.719 --> 05:37.652
but you picked work.

05:37.654 --> 05:39.103
I have to work.

05:39.104 --> 05:40.553
Have fun sitting in
bumper-to-bumper traffic.

05:40.556 --> 05:41.955
Okay, see, joke's
on you, my brother,

05:41.957 --> 05:43.022
because I am
taking the subway

05:43.024 --> 05:44.323
straight to
Santa Monica.

05:44.325 --> 05:46.391
Subway?
That's another reason not to go.

05:48.828 --> 05:51.495
Can't believe the school
is making us take

05:51.497 --> 05:52.929
the children to the museum
on a Saturday.

05:52.931 --> 05:53.996
I know.

05:53.998 --> 05:55.497
Lost weekend, right?

05:55.499 --> 05:56.731
No.

05:56.733 --> 05:57.732
It's just...

05:57.734 --> 05:59.533
Tyler's almost
a pre-Eagle Scout

05:59.535 --> 06:00.867
and there's
an event today.

06:00.869 --> 06:02.468
Does Ralph do Scouts?

06:02.470 --> 06:04.570
Um... no.
Oh.

06:04.572 --> 06:06.572
Well, normally we have
basketball practice afterwards,

06:06.574 --> 06:08.974
but by the time we get back,
it'll be halfway over.

06:08.976 --> 06:10.709
Does Ralph play sports?

06:10.711 --> 06:13.812
Ralph is more of a...
indoor cat.

06:13.814 --> 06:16.281
RALPH: My telescope
has a six-inch

06:16.283 --> 06:17.282
f8 reflector.

06:17.284 --> 06:18.783
Most are eight
inches now,

06:18.785 --> 06:19.817
but I prefer the older version.
(sighs)

06:19.819 --> 06:22.419
Who cares?

06:25.390 --> 06:27.106
Mom...

06:27.107 --> 06:28.823
why do I have to be
partners with him?

06:28.826 --> 06:30.926
MOTHER: Your teacher
chose the partners.

06:30.928 --> 06:33.762
You get what you get
and you don't get upset.

06:33.764 --> 06:35.630
MAN (over P.A.):
Now approaching Grand Park.

06:35.632 --> 06:37.798
Okay, uh, Ralph, telescope away,
our stop's coming up.

06:43.405 --> 06:44.771
That was our stop, Mom.

06:44.773 --> 06:46.156
Yeah, don't worry.

06:46.157 --> 06:47.540
Weekend schedules
sometimes get messed up.

06:47.542 --> 06:49.875
We'll just get off
on the next stop and, uh, walk.

06:49.877 --> 06:51.409
(screaming)

06:51.411 --> 06:53.944
Oh, boy. That's a rocky ride.

06:53.946 --> 06:55.512
Um, Ralph, hold onto something

06:55.514 --> 06:57.614
in case we hit
another bump.

06:57.616 --> 06:59.065
(screaming)

06:59.066 --> 07:00.515
WOMAN: Oh, my God!
PAIGE: Oh, my God,

07:00.518 --> 07:01.884
are you okay?

07:02.553 --> 07:04.753
Ralph?

07:04.755 --> 07:05.820
You okay?

07:07.523 --> 07:08.522
Ralph.

07:08.524 --> 07:09.856
We didn't hit a bump.

07:09.858 --> 07:11.691
The train's going
too fast for the track

07:11.693 --> 07:13.092
and it's speeding up.

07:13.094 --> 07:14.726
Something's wrong, Mom.

07:16.863 --> 07:18.696
Ah.

07:18.698 --> 07:19.963
Okay,

07:19.965 --> 07:21.931
now that I know
the doc's peeper's okay,

07:21.933 --> 07:23.933
I'm not wasting my
Saturday in this joint.

07:23.935 --> 07:25.868
See you when
duty calls.

07:25.870 --> 07:28.036
Okay, Paige, can you ask Ralph
how fast you're going?

07:28.038 --> 07:29.437
Cabe...

07:29.439 --> 07:30.671
Can you get SoCal D.O.T.

07:30.673 --> 07:32.105
on the phone immediately?

07:32.107 --> 07:33.840
Okay. What's going on?

07:33.842 --> 07:35.541
Paige and Ralph
are on the subway,

07:35.543 --> 07:37.109
and their train's gaining
speed and missing stops.

07:37.111 --> 07:38.977
I'm sure it's just
a rectifiable snafu, but...

07:38.979 --> 07:40.411
Calling 'em now.

07:40.413 --> 07:41.545
PAIGE:
Uh, Ralph says we're going

07:41.547 --> 07:42.679
approximately 75 miles an hour.

07:42.681 --> 07:43.980
Uh, what line are you on?

07:43.982 --> 07:45.114
The Olympic line.

07:45.116 --> 07:47.015
Uh, it's automated.
No conductors.

07:47.851 --> 07:49.016
(screaming)

07:49.018 --> 07:50.534
Oh, my God.

07:50.535 --> 07:52.051
Walter, there's something
going on here.

07:52.054 --> 07:53.053
People are getting scared.

07:53.055 --> 07:54.054
You hear her voice?

07:54.056 --> 07:55.655
That's real panic.

07:55.657 --> 07:56.922
Her instincts are screaming--
this isn't just a snafu.

07:56.924 --> 07:58.523
Something is seriously off
with that train.

07:58.525 --> 08:00.791
CABE: And I'm telling
you, get me your supervisor

08:00.793 --> 08:01.958
or I'm gonna come down there

08:01.960 --> 08:03.859
and kick every square inch
of your ass!

08:03.861 --> 08:06.494
Got SoCal D.O.T.
on the line.

08:06.496 --> 08:07.728
Total incompetents.

08:07.730 --> 08:08.962
Yeah, you just keep
sweet-talking 'em, Cabe.

08:08.964 --> 08:10.347
You're doing great.
SYLVESTER: Oh, boy.

08:10.348 --> 08:11.731
I just hacked
the D.O.T. control center,

08:11.733 --> 08:13.866
and Paige's train is going
80 miles an hour and gaining.

08:13.868 --> 08:15.968
HAPPY: Okay, this just
reached DEFCON 1.

08:15.970 --> 08:17.502
Subway cars average
30 miles per hour.

08:17.504 --> 08:20.872
50s is pushing it, 70s is unsafe

08:20.874 --> 08:22.940
and if it reaches mid-90s,
someone is getting hurt.

08:22.942 --> 08:23.840
MAN:
Agent Gallo?

08:23.842 --> 08:24.841
This is James Taggit.

08:24.843 --> 08:26.142
I'm a supervisor

08:26.144 --> 08:27.443
at SoCal Department
of Transportation.

08:27.445 --> 08:28.544
Mr. Taggit.

08:28.546 --> 08:30.312
Are you aware
that you presently have

08:30.313 --> 08:32.079
an out-of-control train
on your Olympic line?

08:32.082 --> 08:33.915
The situation red-lighted
moments ago.

08:33.917 --> 08:35.016
We're just trying
to figure out...

08:35.018 --> 08:37.618
What the hell?

08:37.620 --> 08:39.720
WALTER: Relax, Mr. Taggit.
That's just me.

08:39.722 --> 08:41.272
I've hacked your system.

08:41.273 --> 08:42.823
I'm giving the command
for the train to slow down,

08:42.825 --> 08:43.957
but nothing is responding.

08:43.958 --> 08:45.090
Question one:
who the hell are you?

08:45.093 --> 08:46.476
And question two:

08:46.477 --> 08:47.860
how did you get
into the D.O.T. server?

08:47.862 --> 08:49.728
Answer one:
my name is Walter O'Brien

08:49.730 --> 08:52.097
and answer two: your security
sucks, it's atrocious.

08:52.099 --> 08:55.400
As for your software,
there's a glitch somewhere

08:55.402 --> 08:56.634
that is not allowing it
to respond to commands.

08:56.636 --> 08:57.801
Uh, Walt, we've got
a bigger problem.

08:57.803 --> 08:58.935
Bigger than
a runaway train

08:58.937 --> 09:00.169
under the streets
of Los Angeles?

09:00.171 --> 09:01.637
HAPPY:
Yeah, like if that train

09:01.639 --> 09:03.438
is 20.5 miles
from approaching

09:03.440 --> 09:04.806
an unsustainable
curve radius.

09:04.808 --> 09:05.940
I don't like the sound of that.

09:05.942 --> 09:07.608
We've got a major cant issue.

09:07.610 --> 09:08.542
CABE:
Screw that.

09:08.544 --> 09:10.010
There's no "can't" in Scorpion.

09:11.947 --> 09:14.447
"Cant" is the name
of the height difference

09:14.449 --> 09:17.783
between the outside and
inside rails on a track curve.

09:17.785 --> 09:21.586
The tilt creates a down-thrust
to counter sideways force.

09:22.722 --> 09:23.987
And at the current speed

09:23.989 --> 09:25.922
of Paige's train,
the cant can't work.

09:25.924 --> 09:27.657
The train will derail.

09:27.659 --> 09:29.558
I like the sound
of that even less.

09:29.560 --> 09:31.726
Paige, I will fix this!
Sly, stay on with the D.O.T.

09:31.728 --> 09:33.627
See if you can regain
control of the system.

09:33.629 --> 09:34.995
Where is the curve in the track?

09:34.997 --> 09:36.629
It's under the corner
of Olympic and Arlington.

09:36.631 --> 09:38.697
Average 80 miles an hour,
don't stop at any red lights,

09:38.699 --> 09:40.131
and you'll get there
in just above 11 minutes.

09:40.133 --> 09:42.032
It's gonna be close.
Let's go!

09:44.736 --> 09:45.835
Paige, you'll have to get
all the passengers

09:45.837 --> 09:47.470
to the right side of the train

09:47.471 --> 09:49.104
and have them push
against the train wall.

09:49.106 --> 09:50.905
Counterbalance is one of
the keys to your survival.

09:50.907 --> 09:53.073
One of the keys?
What's the other?

09:53.075 --> 09:55.442
How often they empty the grease
traps at Chucky Burger.

09:56.545 --> 09:58.611
(tires squeal)

10:06.220 --> 10:08.987
Go get canisters
from the gas station!

10:08.989 --> 10:09.887
Happy, hose!

10:09.889 --> 10:12.623
Yeah, okay,

10:12.625 --> 10:14.024
okay.

10:20.765 --> 10:22.765
PAIGE:
Okay, I know it sounds crazy,

10:22.767 --> 10:25.134
but we all have to get to
the right side of the train.

10:25.136 --> 10:26.235
Let's just pull the
emergency cord! No.

10:26.237 --> 10:27.869
Sudden braking
will make us derail,

10:27.871 --> 10:29.437
or so I've been told.

10:29.438 --> 10:31.004
And piling to one side
could make things worse.

10:31.007 --> 10:32.639
This train ain't exactly steady.

10:32.641 --> 10:34.241
RALPH:
It'll work, mister.

10:34.242 --> 10:35.842
You're a construction worker--
you'll understand.

10:35.844 --> 10:37.009
It's like a horizontal
counterbalance

10:37.011 --> 10:38.710
on the back
of a construction crane.

10:40.046 --> 10:41.945
It's the theory
of stable equilibrium.

10:41.947 --> 10:43.546
(brakes squeak)

10:45.049 --> 10:47.883
Okay, everybody, let's get
to the right side!

10:47.885 --> 10:49.150
Let's go!

10:52.855 --> 10:53.987
Thank you, honey.

10:53.989 --> 10:55.521
What are you doing
to my phone?

10:55.523 --> 10:56.722
No time to get
to the other cars,

10:56.724 --> 10:58.474
so I had to tap
into the P.A. system.

10:58.475 --> 11:00.225
Had to strip the insulation off
your earbuds, Ms. Goldberg.

11:00.227 --> 11:02.093
That's okay.

11:02.095 --> 11:03.961
Attention, everybody.

11:03.963 --> 11:05.962
We have an emergency
announcement.

11:09.701 --> 11:11.233
They only had two.

11:11.235 --> 11:13.101
Should be enough.
CABE: How exactly

11:13.103 --> 11:15.036
is putting grease on the tracks
gonna slow down the train?

11:15.038 --> 11:16.237
The grease will lower
the coefficient of friction

11:16.239 --> 11:18.839
between the train track
and the train wheel.

11:18.841 --> 11:22.242
This<i> might</i> be enough to slow the
train down to survive the curve.

11:22.244 --> 11:24.944
I don't like the word
"might" in that sentence.

11:24.946 --> 11:27.046
Sly, can math ease Toby's mind?

11:27.048 --> 11:29.915
Only if a 42% chance
of survival helps.

11:29.917 --> 11:31.616
Guys, this is really...

11:31.618 --> 11:32.984
HAPPY: Not good. I can hear
the train coming down the track.

11:32.986 --> 11:33.985
WALTER:
Well, run faster then.

11:33.987 --> 11:35.052
HAPPY:
You're behind me.

11:36.955 --> 11:38.688
HAPPY:
Curve's up ahead.

11:38.690 --> 11:40.823
Okay.

11:46.864 --> 11:48.897
Walter, there's no
more room over there.

11:48.899 --> 11:50.064
Get over here before you get hit.
Almost done.

11:52.601 --> 11:54.667
O'Brien, move it!

12:09.716 --> 12:11.148
(passengers scream)

12:15.920 --> 12:16.885
I can't believe
it worked.

12:16.887 --> 12:17.986
I can't believe it worked.

12:17.988 --> 12:19.020
I can't believe
it worked.

12:19.022 --> 12:20.554
I can't believe that worked.

12:20.556 --> 12:22.122
HAPPY: Paige, I got a good
look at the train

12:22.124 --> 12:23.890
when it was passing,
it's an A-250.

12:23.892 --> 12:25.124
Uh, there should
be a hatch

12:25.126 --> 12:26.859
in the front cab of the train.

12:26.861 --> 12:28.861
Find it, and I'll talk you
through switching operation

12:28.863 --> 12:31.930
from automatic to manual,
and we can stop that sucker.

12:33.166 --> 12:34.698
It's locked.

12:34.700 --> 12:36.966
After 9/11, trains
were required to install

12:36.968 --> 12:38.334
electronically locked
security doors.

12:38.336 --> 12:40.202
Give me the nine-volt battery
from your stud finder.

12:41.939 --> 12:43.238
Stud finder?

12:43.240 --> 12:44.739
I can't go near those things.

12:44.741 --> 12:45.806
They just go off.

12:50.812 --> 12:52.011
Hold this.

12:58.152 --> 13:00.152
Uh, you want to fill me in here?

13:00.154 --> 13:03.121
Most electronic doors
use a servomotor.

13:03.123 --> 13:05.990
The computer sends an electronic
signal to unlock it.

13:05.992 --> 13:08.325
But since that computer
isn't working,

13:08.327 --> 13:10.160
I'll send the signal myself.
(click)

13:10.162 --> 13:13.029
That's why he doesn't
have time for Scouts.

13:14.165 --> 13:15.664
PAIGE:
Okay, I'm in.

13:15.666 --> 13:16.631
Uh, there's a hatch
on the floor.

13:16.633 --> 13:17.665
Okay, that's the one. Open it.

13:19.735 --> 13:21.735
WALTER: Okay, look for a yellow
switch in a yellow box

13:21.737 --> 13:23.903
right near the opening.

13:23.905 --> 13:25.638
There's a yellow box,
but there's no switch in it.

13:25.640 --> 13:27.139
Okay, that's impossible, that's
how those trains are designed.

13:27.141 --> 13:29.274
Okay, feel inside the box.

13:29.276 --> 13:30.942
Is there, uh, a remnant
of a lever or switch?

13:30.944 --> 13:33.177
Just a bolt, th-there's
n-nothing attached to it.

13:33.179 --> 13:35.012
Ugh, someone took out
the switch.

13:35.014 --> 13:36.813
PAIGE:
What does that mean?

13:36.815 --> 13:38.614
It means the train isn't
malfunctioning from a glitch.

13:40.184 --> 13:41.850
Someone sabotaged that train,

13:41.852 --> 13:43.685
and whoever did that
is controlling it remotely.

13:43.687 --> 13:45.353
Can't I just pull the-the cable
from the router,

13:45.355 --> 13:47.722
like I do at home?
HAPPY: No, they're kept

13:47.724 --> 13:49.824
in locked iron boxes on the
underside of the train's frame.

13:49.826 --> 13:50.791
Why the hell are they there?

13:50.793 --> 13:51.792
So crazy people don't pull

13:51.794 --> 13:52.926
the cable from the router.

13:54.029 --> 13:56.029
I'm sorry, but as of now,

13:56.031 --> 13:57.363
there's no way for you
to stop the train.

13:57.365 --> 13:59.098
What do they mean the train
can't be stopped?

13:59.100 --> 14:01.700
It can't be stopped manually,
but some of the smartest people

14:01.702 --> 14:03.702
in the world are working
on a solution.

14:03.704 --> 14:05.770
Guys, I need a solution now!

14:17.949 --> 14:19.982
Sly, any ideas
from the D.O.T.?

14:19.984 --> 14:21.316
I just got off the phone

14:21.318 --> 14:22.650
with Deputy Director
Cooper at Homeland.

14:22.652 --> 14:23.984
The D.O.T. has
been ordered

14:23.986 --> 14:25.318
to turn control of the
situation over to us.

14:25.320 --> 14:27.270
Homeland must think
this is terrorism.

14:27.271 --> 14:29.221
There's no other reason they'd
exercise their jurisdiction.

14:29.223 --> 14:30.355
Well, they're wrong.

14:30.357 --> 14:32.357
The subway's
a byzantine rats' nest

14:32.359 --> 14:35.326
of dead ends, tight corridors,
half-finished terminals.

14:35.328 --> 14:36.777
If they were terrorists,

14:36.778 --> 14:38.227
they'd have crashed that train a
million different ways already.

14:38.230 --> 14:39.896
Not to mention no
one's taking credit,

14:39.898 --> 14:41.898
no demands, no release
of a manifesto.

14:41.900 --> 14:43.399
This doesn't follow
the terrorist playbook.

14:43.401 --> 14:44.733
Whoever did this has
an ulterior motive

14:44.735 --> 14:46.067
to just controlling a train.

14:46.069 --> 14:48.769
Look, all the trains
are being called back

14:48.771 --> 14:49.770
to their various yards.

14:49.772 --> 14:51.371
CABE:
Safety maneuver.

14:51.373 --> 14:52.872
Now there's no chance
that Paige's train

14:52.874 --> 14:53.873
will collide with another one.

14:53.875 --> 14:55.774
Maybe that's
the ulterior motive.

14:55.776 --> 14:57.842
Getting the trains
back to the yards?

14:57.844 --> 14:59.043
No, no, no,
clearing the tracks.

14:59.045 --> 15:00.177
What if whoever's
behind this

15:00.178 --> 15:01.310
set the whole thing up
just so the D.O.T.

15:01.313 --> 15:02.345
would clear
all the subway lines,

15:02.347 --> 15:03.679
save for one lone train?

15:03.681 --> 15:04.846
Why the hell would
they do that?

15:04.848 --> 15:06.031
TOBY:
I don't know.

15:06.032 --> 15:07.215
But they'd have to have
a darn good reason

15:07.217 --> 15:08.561
to want to be on those tracks

15:08.562 --> 15:09.906
with no risk
of getting run over.

15:09.907 --> 15:11.251
Okay, so most of the
tunnels are built

15:11.254 --> 15:13.787
under, uh, commercial districts
or low-rent neighborhoods.

15:13.789 --> 15:15.822
Uh, doesn't really help
with a motive.

15:15.824 --> 15:17.690
What if there's something
in the tunnels themselves?

15:17.692 --> 15:19.024
No, I've done
some urban exploring

15:19.026 --> 15:20.358
down there on my bike.

15:20.360 --> 15:22.393
Nothing in those tunnels
except rats and more rats.

15:22.395 --> 15:24.428
SYLVESTER: You know, some
of the tunnels predate

15:24.430 --> 15:26.397
the L.A. airport's
construction.

15:26.398 --> 15:28.365
There are terminals built
right on top of them.

15:28.366 --> 15:30.333
L.A. airport is one of
the most secure in the country.

15:31.969 --> 15:34.436
Okay, our bad guy could use
the underground access

15:34.438 --> 15:35.970
from the now-clear
subway tunnels

15:35.972 --> 15:37.871
to get past
all the security

15:37.873 --> 15:39.339
and go right up
into the airport.

15:39.341 --> 15:41.808
Doc, you might be wrong about
that no-terrorism theory.

15:41.810 --> 15:42.942
Well, if I am,
we better move fast,

15:42.944 --> 15:44.276
'cause those tracks
are clear now.

15:44.278 --> 15:46.211
An attack could go down
at any minute. Happy.

15:46.213 --> 15:48.313
Yes, I know, I drive
crazy. Let's go.

15:48.315 --> 15:50.148
Just give me the keys.

15:50.150 --> 15:52.216
(passengers scream)

15:54.320 --> 15:56.853
Tyler, everything
will be all right.

15:56.855 --> 15:58.321
Everything
will be okay.

15:58.323 --> 15:59.789
I promise.

16:06.396 --> 16:08.396
MAN: You guys need
to wrap this up ASAP.

16:08.398 --> 16:10.931
We got 10,000 passengers
evac'd in the street.

16:10.933 --> 16:12.365
If they miss their
flights for no reason...

16:12.367 --> 16:14.734
Terrorism's a good reason.
MAN: Already told you

16:14.736 --> 16:16.402
we've been through
every inch of the airport.

16:16.404 --> 16:19.238
No suspicious packages, no
traces of explosives. Nothing.

16:19.240 --> 16:21.306
WOMAN: We just checked inside
this room 20 minutes ago.

16:21.308 --> 16:22.858
And Customs has
had double security

16:22.859 --> 16:24.409
outside this door all day--
no one's come in or out.

16:24.411 --> 16:26.411
Open the door; this is
the last place we look.

16:26.413 --> 16:28.413
If there's nothing there, I'll
take the heat for this mess.

16:33.886 --> 16:35.218
WALTER:
Oh, great.

16:35.220 --> 16:37.753
So much for nobody going
inside or out.

16:37.755 --> 16:39.521
HAPPY:
Well, they came under.

16:39.523 --> 16:42.056
This isn't terrorism,
this is a heist.

16:42.058 --> 16:44.391
What the hell were you guys
keeping in this place?

16:44.393 --> 16:47.394
The Kellion collection, $50
million of British gold coins,

16:47.396 --> 16:49.396
being shipped to some Silicon
Valley billionaire.

16:49.398 --> 16:50.830
Not anymore.

16:50.832 --> 16:52.164
MAN: How'd they get in
without anyone hearing?

16:52.166 --> 16:53.965
HAPPY: Hydro-drill
with a silencer.

16:53.967 --> 16:55.499
Hammer wrapped in a hand towel.

16:55.501 --> 16:57.133
You wouldn't hear it
from all the way out there.

16:57.135 --> 16:58.868
They<i> didn't</i> hear it from
all the way out there.

16:58.870 --> 17:00.469
(metal clangs)

17:00.471 --> 17:02.237
Heard that.

17:02.239 --> 17:05.005
PhD I have, but I go in the
hole with the rats and the bugs.

17:07.009 --> 17:09.074
All right.

17:11.878 --> 17:13.110
You know, for
the record,

17:13.112 --> 17:14.444
I was right about this
not being terrorism.

17:14.446 --> 17:15.778
Since no one's pointing
that out, I thought I would.

17:15.780 --> 17:16.779
I was right.

17:16.781 --> 17:18.413
Up there.

17:22.518 --> 17:23.534
Freeze!

17:23.535 --> 17:24.551
Okay, everyone off the
track. I have an idea.

17:26.421 --> 17:28.187
Can't out-run electricity
now that he's wet.

17:28.189 --> 17:30.556
He's conductive as long as
he's within a foot of the rail.

17:39.232 --> 17:42.566
Strong pulse-- he's
just knocked out.

17:42.568 --> 17:45.402
CABE:
Found the coins, nothing else.

17:45.404 --> 17:47.337
Yeah, that makes sense--
he steals the gold

17:47.339 --> 17:49.472
while some partner somewhere
remotely controls the train.

17:49.474 --> 17:51.574
Not for long.
Sylvester,

17:51.576 --> 17:53.108
how far away is the train?

17:53.110 --> 17:55.110
Its current path has it just
a few minutes from you,

17:55.112 --> 17:57.412
headed towards the Olympic
and Westwood stop. Why?

17:57.414 --> 17:58.446
'Cause I'm getting on board.

17:58.448 --> 18:01.182
Suicidal genius
says what now?

18:01.184 --> 18:02.834
This guy has nothing on him
to help with the train,

18:02.835 --> 18:04.485
but if I can hard-wire
into the train's computer,

18:04.487 --> 18:06.820
then I can build a firewall
to block off the incoming signal

18:06.822 --> 18:08.388
that's controlling it.

18:08.390 --> 18:10.256
Then once
it's blocked,

18:10.258 --> 18:11.841
Sylvester can slow down
the train gradually.

18:11.842 --> 18:13.425
Happy, you're gonna drive me
to Olympic and Westwood.

18:13.427 --> 18:15.894
Hold on, how the hell
are you gonna

18:15.896 --> 18:17.862
get on a train going
90 miles an hour?

18:17.864 --> 18:19.997
I presume with great caution.

18:29.941 --> 18:32.908
Better hurry if you want
to catch that train.

18:32.910 --> 18:34.843
Really?

18:34.845 --> 18:36.511
Couldn't help myself.

18:36.513 --> 18:39.514
Ralph, I have to assume
these trains weren't designed

18:39.516 --> 18:41.883
for these kind of speeds.

18:41.885 --> 18:43.218
Structural integrity
is already compromised.

18:43.219 --> 18:44.552
Mechanical failure is certain
if the train isn't stopped.

18:44.554 --> 18:47.121
Wonderful.
It'll be okay.

18:47.123 --> 18:49.523
Walter will be here any second.
That's right, stay optimistic.

18:49.525 --> 18:51.858
No, really, he'll be
here any second. Look.

18:54.128 --> 18:54.993
Oh, God.

18:56.496 --> 18:57.962
(grunts)

18:59.932 --> 19:01.898
I seem to have overshot
the emergency window.

19:01.900 --> 19:03.266
It won't open.

19:05.503 --> 19:08.337
Walter, you're coming up on
a junction box in 25 seconds.

19:08.339 --> 19:09.404
You need to get inside.

19:10.607 --> 19:11.872
The emergency door, we
can pull him in here.

19:11.874 --> 19:13.640
It's not working.

19:13.642 --> 19:16.876
Ugh, mass transit,
of course it's broken.

19:17.645 --> 19:19.077
Paige, in 20 seconds,
I'm broken.

19:19.079 --> 19:20.511
We need to do something
or I die.

19:27.552 --> 19:29.218
I don't know what to do.

19:29.220 --> 19:31.353
You are normally the person
in charge of these situations.

19:31.355 --> 19:33.154
Yeah, well, not while
I'm hanging off a train.

19:33.156 --> 19:35.289
Ralph, you need
to help me out here, buddy.

19:35.291 --> 19:37.157
Is anyone wearing
porcelain jewelry?

19:37.159 --> 19:39.392
Even just the smallest piece
can break tempered glass.

19:41.929 --> 19:43.161
Yeah, yeah.
Stand back.

19:53.639 --> 19:55.472
RALPH:
My telescope.

19:55.474 --> 19:57.407
I'll get you a new one.

19:58.343 --> 19:59.608
Damn, Paige.

20:02.245 --> 20:05.379
Okay, now, Ralph,
we need to hard-wire

20:05.381 --> 20:07.381
my laptop into the train system

20:07.383 --> 20:10.050
so I can build
a firewall-blocking

20:10.052 --> 20:12.218
wireless access to the router.

20:12.220 --> 20:15.187
We cut off the bad guy's access,
we can drive the train.

20:15.189 --> 20:17.189
That's my boy.

20:17.191 --> 20:18.635
HAPPY:
Hey, you guys might not have

20:18.636 --> 20:20.080
enough time to get
that firewall down.

20:20.081 --> 20:21.525
You've been burning up track
for way too long.

20:21.528 --> 20:23.261
The gearbox can go
at any moment.

20:23.263 --> 20:25.096
Cabe, I think our best bet
is for you to find

20:25.098 --> 20:26.230
whoever's controlling
that train.

20:26.232 --> 20:27.564
What do you think
I'm trying to do?

20:29.067 --> 20:31.100
Who's your partner
controlling that train?

20:31.102 --> 20:33.435
(shouts)

20:33.437 --> 20:36.104
I've stolen hundreds
of millions

20:36.106 --> 20:38.439
for-for clients from
Hong Kong to Dubai.

20:38.441 --> 20:40.073
I talk, they kill me.

20:40.075 --> 20:43.242
I keep quiet, I get
12 years, I do nine.

20:43.244 --> 20:45.244
And when I get out,
they reward me--

20:45.246 --> 20:46.612
millions-- for keeping quiet.

20:46.614 --> 20:49.982
So what's in it for me
to cooperate?

20:49.984 --> 20:52.651
What the hell are you doing?

20:52.653 --> 20:54.152
What you clearly can't.

20:54.154 --> 20:56.087
Stuff this jerk inside.
To what end?

20:56.089 --> 20:57.555
I'm sending him
to sleepaway camp

20:57.557 --> 20:59.156
to get the name of his partner.

20:59.158 --> 21:01.358
Can you trust the guy
with the genius IQ?

21:01.360 --> 21:03.093
You're wasting
your time.

21:03.095 --> 21:04.227
I'm not claustrophobic,
all right?

21:04.229 --> 21:06.395
I'll just go in there
and take a nap!

21:06.397 --> 21:08.697
Sweet dreams.
Aah!

21:08.699 --> 21:10.198
Now what?

21:10.200 --> 21:12.667
Let's take this putz for a ride!

21:14.370 --> 21:16.403
WALTER:
<i> Okay, I'm making progress.</i>

21:16.405 --> 21:18.338
Just configured
the first network card.

21:18.340 --> 21:20.073
You're not making
fast enough progress.

21:20.075 --> 21:22.508
I know, Happy already told me
about the gearbox.

21:22.510 --> 21:23.742
No, screw the gearbox!

21:23.744 --> 21:25.276
You're coming up
on a split in the tracks

21:25.278 --> 21:26.661
18 miles ahead.

21:26.662 --> 21:28.045
Right now, the train
is going to turn left.

21:28.047 --> 21:30.047
And it's gonna send you

21:30.048 --> 21:32.048
head first into
an unfinished subway platform.

21:32.051 --> 21:34.317
But if it goes right,
you'll land on a straight

21:34.319 --> 21:35.584
stretch of track
for several miles.

21:35.586 --> 21:37.752
Then send us right!
I can't.

21:37.754 --> 21:39.754
When the D.O.T. recalled
the rest of the trains

21:39.756 --> 21:41.055
back to the yard,

21:41.057 --> 21:42.589
they locked all the switches.

21:42.591 --> 21:44.057
The D.O.T. is going to take

21:44.059 --> 21:45.758
20 minutes to unlock
the switch system!

21:45.760 --> 21:47.292
Can the switch be
controlled manually?

21:47.294 --> 21:51.029
Uh, let me check.

21:51.031 --> 21:54.165
Yes, but you need to hit
the lever on the switch itself.

21:54.167 --> 21:56.667
Okay, Walter, keep on that
firewall. I'll handle this.

21:56.669 --> 21:59.002
Give me a comm!
Uh, okay.

22:03.241 --> 22:04.440
We need anything of length!

22:04.442 --> 22:05.641
Sir, I need your cane.

22:05.643 --> 22:08.243
Sarah, start tearing
your scarf into strips.

22:08.245 --> 22:10.178
I need it to tie
this stuff together.

22:15.118 --> 22:17.284
We've been doing this forever.
This is stupid.

22:17.286 --> 22:19.185
There is three primal fears
everyone shares.

22:19.187 --> 22:20.619
Extinction-- ceasing to exist.

22:20.621 --> 22:23.188
Mutilation-- having one's
body boundaries infiltrated.

22:23.190 --> 22:25.190
And loss of autonomy--
feeling entrapped or paralyzed.

22:25.192 --> 22:27.458
Being buried alive
covers all three.

22:27.460 --> 22:29.359
That should be enough.

22:29.361 --> 22:30.493
(engine shuts off)

22:35.533 --> 22:38.066
Hey, Cabe?

22:38.068 --> 22:39.200
You got a hat?

22:39.202 --> 22:41.268
It's boiling out here.

22:43.505 --> 22:45.037
SUSPECT:
Are those shovels?

22:45.039 --> 22:46.338
What the hell you guys doing?!

22:46.340 --> 22:48.039
You're in Angeles National
Forest, dingus.

22:48.041 --> 22:49.340
To be more accurate,

22:49.342 --> 22:51.308
you're in a trench
in Angeles National Forest.

22:51.310 --> 22:54.044
I would start holding my
breath if I were you.

22:54.046 --> 22:55.111
You kidding me?!

22:55.113 --> 22:56.145
You're cops!

22:56.147 --> 22:57.779
You can't
bury me alive!

22:57.781 --> 22:59.781
CABE:
You take my friends' lives,

22:59.783 --> 23:02.083
we take yours--
they die, you die!

23:02.085 --> 23:04.085
TOBY: Soil here is
ripe with centipedes.

23:04.087 --> 23:05.352
The good news is,
you'll be mostly dead

23:05.354 --> 23:07.153
when they get
in your intestines.

23:07.155 --> 23:09.188
All right, all right!
My partner's name is Aldo!

23:09.190 --> 23:11.557
He's controlling the train
out of a warehouse!

23:11.559 --> 23:13.692
4343 Cooke Street!

23:13.694 --> 23:15.827
Now get me
the hell out of here!

23:15.829 --> 23:17.662
Let's go.

23:17.664 --> 23:20.064
Hey!

23:22.068 --> 23:23.834
What is that?

23:23.836 --> 23:26.336
Uh, magic wand-- it's gonna
let me change the track switch

23:26.338 --> 23:27.704
lever without ever
leaving the train.

23:27.706 --> 23:28.771
Well, I'll-I'll do it.

23:28.773 --> 23:30.739
No, you need
to build a firewall.

23:30.741 --> 23:32.507
Efficiency dictates
that one of us each try

23:32.509 --> 23:33.841
to solve this problem to double
our chances of success.

23:33.843 --> 23:35.375
And since I can't code,

23:35.377 --> 23:37.176
I get to hang outside
of the speeding train.

23:37.178 --> 23:38.778
I don't like this.
What?

23:38.779 --> 23:40.379
Me taking a risk or me
using logic against you?

23:40.381 --> 23:40.846
Both.

23:43.817 --> 23:46.417
(passengers screaming)

23:50.656 --> 23:52.222
SYLVESTER:
Okay, Paige?

23:52.224 --> 23:54.857
Think of it
like a giant light switch.

23:54.859 --> 23:55.824
Got it!

23:55.826 --> 23:57.192
You're gonna hit the lever,

23:57.194 --> 23:58.493
change tracks,
buying enough time

23:58.495 --> 23:59.727
for Walter to get control
of the train digitally.

23:59.729 --> 24:01.795
Right.
And if you miss,

24:01.797 --> 24:04.364
you go left, right into
the concrete platform.

24:04.366 --> 24:06.099
Sylvester, I know
the situation!

24:06.101 --> 24:07.767
I'm sorry, I'm nervous!

24:07.769 --> 24:09.668
HAPPY: <i> Walter, I do not</i>
<i> like the sound of this!</i>

24:09.670 --> 24:11.136
At 92 miles per hour,
she is never

24:11.138 --> 24:12.670
gonna be able to hold
onto that lance.

24:12.672 --> 24:14.388
I can do it!

24:14.389 --> 24:16.105
It's just like when I take
Ralph to Medieval Times.

24:16.108 --> 24:17.140
You need a backup plan!

24:17.142 --> 24:19.842
(tires screech)

24:22.613 --> 24:24.112
Don't move!

24:25.281 --> 24:26.713
You better hope
you can reach

24:26.715 --> 24:28.848
for that before I shoot.

24:28.850 --> 24:30.216
(shouts)

24:30.218 --> 24:31.817
I think that's my buddy's seat.

24:31.819 --> 24:33.251
Nice, subtle.

24:33.253 --> 24:34.685
All right, Walter,
we found the remote user.

24:34.687 --> 24:35.819
I'm at his computer now.

24:35.821 --> 24:37.353
Then slow us down!

24:37.355 --> 24:38.520
It's not that easy.

24:38.522 --> 24:40.455
He had locked-in
operational protocol.

24:40.457 --> 24:42.123
If I want to stop the train,
I have to shut it down

24:42.125 --> 24:43.824
and reboot first.
Not enough time!

24:43.826 --> 24:46.126
Paige, we're 30 seconds
away from that switch!

24:46.128 --> 24:47.227
You got to hit that lever!

24:47.229 --> 24:48.228
Yeah, I can see the switch!

24:48.230 --> 24:49.295
I'll be able to hit it!

24:49.297 --> 24:50.829
We'll be okay!

24:56.202 --> 24:58.802
Oh, my God, I dropped it!

25:08.713 --> 25:11.313
Walter, we're gonna crash!
Aah!

25:11.315 --> 25:12.547
What are we gonna do?

25:12.549 --> 25:15.315
I don...
I don't have an answer.

25:17.819 --> 25:20.152
What the heck is that?!

25:20.154 --> 25:21.920
(panting)

25:25.926 --> 25:27.892
I think that's our backup plan.

25:41.674 --> 25:44.441
Okay.

25:44.443 --> 25:46.242
That was amazing, Happy!

25:46.244 --> 25:49.278
I told you you weren't gonna be
able to hold onto that pole.

25:49.280 --> 25:51.446
It's done--
I shut down the remote protocol.

25:51.448 --> 25:53.915
(beeping)

25:53.917 --> 25:56.183
Walter, you should have
manual control now.

25:56.185 --> 25:58.218
(beeping)

25:58.220 --> 26:00.453
Happy, I can drive
this thing now-- any advice?

26:00.455 --> 26:02.221
Apply the brakes gradually.

26:02.223 --> 26:03.956
Any more than a nine percent
depression rate,

26:03.958 --> 26:05.324
and you will jackknife
at that speed.

26:05.326 --> 26:06.558
Use a light hand
and you'll coast

26:06.560 --> 26:08.192
right into the downtown station.

26:10.362 --> 26:12.228
Copy that.
Here goes.

26:13.631 --> 26:16.264
(brakes screeching)

26:23.872 --> 26:25.805
(beeping)

26:25.807 --> 26:27.239
Walter, what the hell
is happening?!

26:27.241 --> 26:28.506
Happy, we're overheating!

26:28.508 --> 26:29.840
That's impossible.

26:29.842 --> 26:31.942
Okay, unless some
of the Chucky Burger grease

26:31.944 --> 26:33.877
leaked into the brake pads.

26:33.879 --> 26:36.880
Okay, lard has a flash-burn
point of 301 degrees.

26:36.882 --> 26:38.848
The friction is
heating things up.

26:40.785 --> 26:43.218
We've lost the brakes
and we're still going 88!

26:43.220 --> 26:44.919
Walter, in six miles
you're going to reach

26:44.921 --> 26:46.737
the entrance tunnel
to the station!

26:46.738 --> 26:48.554
This train is a wide-body--
swaying at this speed,

26:48.557 --> 26:50.390
it'll hit the sides
of the tunnel and derail!

26:50.392 --> 26:52.792
Maybe not!
I have an idea.

26:54.962 --> 26:56.461
Cops will be by
for you shortly.

26:56.463 --> 26:57.995
Doc?

26:57.997 --> 26:59.896
We got to get
to the train station.

27:03.801 --> 27:05.567
I am already on my way.

27:05.569 --> 27:08.002
O'Brien, what exactly
is your idea?

27:08.004 --> 27:09.937
Guys, everybody, listen to me!

27:09.939 --> 27:11.738
You have to get
onto the next car!

27:11.740 --> 27:13.873
Okay? It's for your safety!

27:13.875 --> 27:16.408
Come on, faster! Faster!
Empty the car!

27:20.247 --> 27:23.314
PAIGE:
Now what?

27:23.316 --> 27:24.948
Okay, now that we've got
control of the train,

27:24.950 --> 27:26.816
we can decouple the cars.

27:26.818 --> 27:28.284
The front car will crash,

27:28.286 --> 27:29.918
but the rear cars
will slow to a stop.

27:29.920 --> 27:31.352
Okay, that's part
of a two-step process.

27:31.354 --> 27:32.920
Now, you guys get
onto the next car.

27:32.922 --> 27:34.988
Ralph, there's an operating
panel near the door.

27:34.990 --> 27:36.889
There's a decoupling lever--
you flip it,

27:36.891 --> 27:38.423
it sends a signal.

27:38.425 --> 27:40.725
I accept the signal
and then I have ten seconds

27:40.727 --> 27:41.892
to get onto your side

27:41.894 --> 27:43.426
before both cars
separate.

27:43.428 --> 27:44.560
Okay, we have
more than enough time,

27:44.562 --> 27:45.827
but you have to hurry.

27:47.897 --> 27:51.265
Okay, be careful.

27:51.267 --> 27:54.468
I will.

28:03.645 --> 28:06.312
Mommy, there's
no decoupling lever in here.

28:15.322 --> 28:17.322
Walter, no!

28:17.324 --> 28:20.625
Someone needs to stay on here
to disengage the cars.

28:20.627 --> 28:22.760
It's how the train was designed.

28:22.762 --> 28:24.027
Walter, don't do this!

28:24.029 --> 28:25.962
I'm sorry.

28:25.964 --> 28:27.763
Walter, no!

28:27.765 --> 28:29.431
SYLVESTER: Walter,
once you remove the weight

28:29.433 --> 28:32.467
of those back cars, your car
will gain speed and it will ping

28:32.469 --> 28:34.302
around that narrow tunnel
like a pinball!

28:34.304 --> 28:36.537
It is guaranteed death!

28:38.841 --> 28:40.440
And guaranteed life
for Paige and Ralph.

28:40.442 --> 28:41.808
Walter!

28:43.444 --> 28:45.310
Walter, don't do this.

29:12.939 --> 29:14.038
SYLVESTER: Walter, you have
exactly 19 seconds

29:14.040 --> 29:15.039
until you reach that tunnel!

29:15.041 --> 29:16.540
You need to do something!

29:17.543 --> 29:19.943
19 seconds--
he's not gonna make it!

29:21.046 --> 29:22.445
The brake cord!

29:22.447 --> 29:23.846
No, you know what happens

29:23.848 --> 29:25.080
when you pull that thing!

29:25.082 --> 29:27.482
I'm not gonna pull it!

29:27.484 --> 29:29.817
I'm gonna use it
to get out of here.

29:29.819 --> 29:31.618
Six seconds!

29:31.620 --> 29:33.853
Five, four,

29:33.855 --> 29:35.588
three, two,

29:35.590 --> 29:38.090
one!

29:38.092 --> 29:39.624
Okay, here it comes!

29:52.471 --> 29:55.505
I can't see anything.

29:55.507 --> 29:57.573
There's nothing
but twisted metal and smoke.

29:59.777 --> 30:01.676
WALTER:
Little help!

30:08.450 --> 30:10.650
Oh, thank God!

30:10.652 --> 30:12.118
TOBY:
Walter, what are you doing?

30:12.120 --> 30:13.486
You just hanging around?

30:14.689 --> 30:17.523
That joke never gets old.

30:17.525 --> 30:19.725
Oh, very funny.
Some assistance?

30:19.727 --> 30:22.461
Yeah, I got you, kid.
Let go!

30:26.433 --> 30:28.566
I guess your plans

30:28.568 --> 30:30.568
to work on the rocket today
were derailed.

30:30.570 --> 30:31.569
(laughs)

30:31.571 --> 30:32.636
Seriously?

30:32.638 --> 30:34.104
PAIGE:
Walter?

30:35.073 --> 30:38.573
Oh, Paige, you know,
next time maybe you...

30:40.410 --> 30:43.611
Don't ever do something
like that to me again!

30:43.613 --> 30:45.112
Come on.

30:48.951 --> 30:50.717
Great, she hits
harder than me.

31:06.634 --> 31:07.699
I would give anything

31:07.701 --> 31:09.667
for Happy to care enough
to slap me.

31:09.669 --> 31:11.001
Bargaining.

31:11.003 --> 31:12.602
Third stage of grief.

31:12.604 --> 31:14.437
It's just so disheartening.

31:14.439 --> 31:16.572
And there's depression.

31:16.574 --> 31:17.739
I've counted the gold coins.

31:17.741 --> 31:19.207
One of them's missing.

31:19.209 --> 31:20.675
Oh, I'm not a thief.

31:20.677 --> 31:21.676
I just wanted
to play<i> Proton Arnold</i>

31:21.678 --> 31:23.678
with a $2 million quarter.

31:24.847 --> 31:27.747
I'll go get it.

31:30.084 --> 31:33.585
Ooh. Yo!

31:33.587 --> 31:34.752
So?

31:34.754 --> 31:37.521
Polly knock
some sense into you?

31:37.523 --> 31:39.890
It's Paige,
and I made a calculated decision

31:39.892 --> 31:41.925
to save passengers.

31:41.927 --> 31:43.559
Whoa, see, I'm not
talking about the train.

31:43.561 --> 31:45.661
I'm talking about you ignoring
your feelings for her.

31:45.663 --> 31:46.662
I did have feelings,

31:46.664 --> 31:48.664
but now they're
under control.

31:48.666 --> 31:50.999
Anyway, shouldn't you be
back in the camper?

31:51.001 --> 31:54.668
Denial ain't just a river
in Turkey, my friend.

31:55.737 --> 31:57.803
(scoffs)

31:59.640 --> 32:01.640
If you really believed
they were controlled,

32:01.642 --> 32:05.210
you wouldn't feel the need
to distance yourself from her.

32:05.212 --> 32:07.212
Right? Like saying
you need to work,

32:07.214 --> 32:08.846
instead of going
to the museum with her

32:08.848 --> 32:11.748
and the-the kid, you know,
with the Beatles haircut...

32:11.750 --> 32:13.650
His name's Ralph.
Sounds right.

32:13.651 --> 32:15.551
Anyway, look, as
your best friend,

32:15.553 --> 32:17.986
I can tell you, putting
distance between you

32:17.988 --> 32:21.255
and people you care about?

32:21.257 --> 32:23.023
That doesn't end well.

32:28.195 --> 32:32.230
Is this from experience?

32:38.904 --> 32:40.536
This have something to do

32:40.538 --> 32:42.838
with the medal I
saw this morning?

32:42.840 --> 32:45.073
You said it wasn't yours.

32:46.142 --> 32:47.708
Ray?

32:49.578 --> 32:53.046
You say we're best friends.

32:53.048 --> 32:55.114
Whose is it?

32:56.584 --> 32:58.650
Danny Tuggle.

33:01.054 --> 33:03.754
We joined
the department together.

33:03.756 --> 33:07.691
Same house,
same engine company.

33:07.693 --> 33:10.660
I-I didn't really have
a family, so he and his wife--

33:10.662 --> 33:12.728
they kind of,
they adopted me.

33:12.730 --> 33:14.796
You know, I ate with them
three times a week.

33:14.798 --> 33:17.865
I was, I was godfather
to his son.

33:19.668 --> 33:22.702
Ten years ago,
there was a five-alarm.

33:22.704 --> 33:25.738
Downtown.
Gas line blew.

33:25.740 --> 33:27.639
Smoke everywhere,
and I got a,

33:27.641 --> 33:29.140
I got a lungful...

33:29.142 --> 33:30.841
before I got my mask on.

33:30.843 --> 33:32.275
And-and-and, you know, Danny,

33:32.277 --> 33:34.210
he was, he was, he was down.

33:34.212 --> 33:35.678
He was on the ground.

33:35.680 --> 33:37.680
And I-I tried to...

33:37.682 --> 33:40.783
get his regulator
on his mouth.

33:40.785 --> 33:43.752
(voice breaks):
But I was getting dizzy.

33:45.756 --> 33:47.822
Wake up in the hospital.

33:49.325 --> 33:52.792
And Danny never wakes up.

33:54.829 --> 33:58.163
It was my fault.
It was my fault.

33:58.165 --> 34:00.198
I should've got
the regulator on his mouth.

34:00.200 --> 34:04.101
That's unfortunate.

34:04.103 --> 34:07.070
Was supposed to...

34:07.072 --> 34:09.072
present the medal
to his wife at the funeral.

34:09.074 --> 34:12.842
But...
I couldn't face her,

34:12.844 --> 34:16.812
her son, so I just...

34:16.814 --> 34:18.914
never saw them again.

34:21.151 --> 34:24.118
I distanced myself
from people I loved.

34:24.120 --> 34:25.786
I was wrong.

34:27.689 --> 34:30.089
And you're making
the same mistake.

34:32.093 --> 34:34.793
Don't let the distance
get so far

34:34.795 --> 34:36.828
you can never
re-couple the train.

34:38.865 --> 34:40.364
Okay?

34:53.745 --> 34:55.878
HAPPY:
Cool, Chet, I will see you

34:55.880 --> 34:57.779
at Dorsey's in a half-hour.

34:57.781 --> 34:58.913
(phone beeps)

34:58.915 --> 35:01.615
See you jokers tomorrow.

35:01.617 --> 35:03.649
Good night, kid.

35:06.854 --> 35:08.119
I'm gonna go to that club.

35:08.121 --> 35:10.121
That's not a good idea, Doc.

35:10.123 --> 35:11.889
You really need
another black eye?

35:11.891 --> 35:13.090
I'm not looking
for trouble.

35:13.092 --> 35:14.758
I-I just need
to see Happy...

35:14.760 --> 35:17.093
happy with Chet.

35:17.095 --> 35:18.861
And then I'm
at the fifth stage of grief.

35:18.863 --> 35:20.095
Acceptance.

35:20.097 --> 35:22.864
And then I can move on.

35:26.736 --> 35:28.802
(door opens)

35:30.005 --> 35:32.071
(door closes)

35:40.180 --> 35:42.980
Hey.

35:44.817 --> 35:47.651
How is he?

35:47.653 --> 35:49.919
He's out cold.

35:49.921 --> 35:52.888
Uh, but he did
great today.

35:52.890 --> 35:55.357
I didn't think he could impress
me any more than he has.

35:55.359 --> 35:57.992
And, uh, not only me.

35:57.994 --> 36:00.127
Tyler Goldberg texted.

36:00.129 --> 36:01.895
He wants a playdate with Ralph.

36:01.897 --> 36:03.363
Why wouldn't he?

36:03.365 --> 36:04.831
He's a great kid.

36:07.869 --> 36:10.202
Look, about before--
I shouldn't have hit you.

36:10.204 --> 36:11.770
I-I know you
didn't mean it, so...

36:11.772 --> 36:13.371
No, I meant it.

36:13.373 --> 36:16.273
Walter, you're
always thinking about

36:16.275 --> 36:18.008
the greater good and how
everybody else needs saving,

36:18.010 --> 36:20.910
but I need you
to be selfish for once

36:20.912 --> 36:22.811
and think about yourself.

36:22.813 --> 36:25.180
I'm confused.

36:27.184 --> 36:28.917
Look at that boy over there.

36:28.919 --> 36:30.952
Think about how important

36:30.954 --> 36:32.103
you are to him.

36:32.104 --> 36:33.253
Think about the team,
your friends.

36:33.256 --> 36:35.823
How important
you are to them.

36:35.825 --> 36:37.891
Think about...

36:41.029 --> 36:44.864
Think about...

36:44.866 --> 36:47.766
how important
you are to me.

36:49.870 --> 36:54.706
Walter, I hit you
because you scared me.

36:54.708 --> 36:57.842
I was scared I was
gonna lose you today.

36:57.844 --> 36:59.977
I saw you disappearing
into the-the blackness,

36:59.979 --> 37:01.945
and it frightened me.

37:06.350 --> 37:07.916
CABE:
Walter?

37:07.918 --> 37:10.018
I need you to come
with me down to this club.

37:10.020 --> 37:11.919
Toby's following
Happy down there,

37:11.921 --> 37:14.988
and I'm worried things might
get dicey with this Chet guy.

37:14.990 --> 37:16.422
Doc'll listen to you.

37:20.327 --> 37:22.460
You should go.

37:23.963 --> 37:24.895
Okay.

37:31.769 --> 37:33.835
(laughter, chatter)

37:37.207 --> 37:39.874
Holy crow, it's a comedy club.

37:39.876 --> 37:41.659
There's Chet.

37:41.660 --> 37:43.443
So, I have
a six-year-old daughter.

37:43.446 --> 37:45.946
Please, don't clap.
She looks like me.

37:45.948 --> 37:48.114
So, it's gonna be
a tough prom season

37:48.116 --> 37:50.349
for a girl that looks
like Freddie Mercury.

37:50.351 --> 37:52.851
I don't know how
she's gonna do it.

37:52.853 --> 37:55.787
Thank you for laughing
at my child's pain.

37:55.789 --> 37:57.021
That's very nice of you.

37:57.023 --> 37:59.156
Anyway, we're gonna keep
open mic night going,

37:59.158 --> 38:02.759
uh, with someone who's brand-new
to the comedy scene.

38:02.761 --> 38:04.427
Someone that I've
trained personally.

38:04.429 --> 38:06.996
But if she bombs,

38:06.998 --> 38:08.864
I've never seen her
before in my life.

38:08.866 --> 38:11.166
Happy Quinn,
ladies and gentlemen!

38:11.168 --> 38:13.301
Did I fall on my head?
Am I having a seizure?

38:13.303 --> 38:16.537
No, this is actually happening.

38:21.009 --> 38:23.042
Knock, knock.

38:24.512 --> 38:27.246
Knock, knock!

38:27.248 --> 38:28.947
MAN:
Who's there?

38:28.949 --> 38:30.014
Matthew.

38:30.016 --> 38:31.548
MAN 2:
Matthew who?

38:31.550 --> 38:35.552
"Math-you" could never do
unless you had an IQ of 184.

38:35.554 --> 38:37.820
(laughing)

38:38.923 --> 38:40.989
What?

38:40.991 --> 38:43.791
Ammonia

38:43.793 --> 38:47.294
and sodium hypochlorite
hook up at a bar.

38:47.296 --> 38:50.030
Everyone inside dies.

38:50.032 --> 38:53.033
(laughing):
It's funny

38:53.035 --> 38:54.501
because it's true!

38:54.503 --> 38:56.569
HAPPY: I've been reading
this great book

38:56.571 --> 38:58.103
on antigravity.

38:58.105 --> 39:00.004
I can't put it down.

39:00.006 --> 39:03.073
I have this new theory

39:03.075 --> 39:06.042
on inertia, but it's
not gaining any momentum.

39:06.044 --> 39:07.143
(laughing):
She said...

39:07.145 --> 39:08.444
Thank you.

39:08.446 --> 39:09.912
Thank you!

39:09.914 --> 39:12.814
(Sylvester laughing)
(crowd murmuring)

39:16.986 --> 39:18.585
(whoops)

39:19.988 --> 39:21.354
That was factual.

39:21.356 --> 39:22.988
No, that was awesome.

39:22.990 --> 39:24.923
'Cause Chet isn't her boyfriend.

39:24.925 --> 39:26.224
He's her comedy coach.

39:26.226 --> 39:27.858
A terrible one at that.

39:27.860 --> 39:29.159
You know,
all this time,

39:29.161 --> 39:30.960
Happy and I were
doing the same thing.

39:30.962 --> 39:32.928
We were each subconsciously
replacing the risk

39:32.930 --> 39:34.462
our relationship represented.

39:34.464 --> 39:36.063
I got into a ring,
where I had no business being.

39:36.065 --> 39:37.964
And Happy,
the world's unfunniest person,

39:37.966 --> 39:39.966
tried to make strangers laugh.

39:39.968 --> 39:43.402
We were replacing what we lost
when we lost each other.

39:43.404 --> 39:46.071
That excitement of risk.

39:46.073 --> 39:47.539
This means
that deep inside of her

39:47.541 --> 39:49.274
there is a seedling of regret.

39:49.276 --> 39:51.843
So you're gonna
keep going after her?

39:51.845 --> 39:54.045
No.

39:54.047 --> 39:57.248
I'm gonna let
that seedling grow on its own.

39:57.250 --> 40:00.417
If it's meant to become
a mighty love oak, it will.

40:00.419 --> 40:03.052
I feel a lot better

40:03.054 --> 40:04.553
than I did
when I walked in here.

40:04.555 --> 40:05.887
You know what?
Me, too.

40:05.889 --> 40:07.355
Because Happy is hilarious.

40:07.357 --> 40:09.223
I mean, where did
that come from?

40:09.225 --> 40:12.125
Hey, I, uh, I think I
walked in on a moment

40:12.127 --> 40:14.594
between you and Paige
in the garage, and, uh,

40:14.596 --> 40:15.995
sorry about that.

40:15.997 --> 40:18.163
It was just a conversation.

40:18.165 --> 40:20.999
I've been in a conversation, and
that looked more like a moment.

40:21.001 --> 40:24.635
In physics, the term "moment"
is a combination

40:24.637 --> 40:26.937
of the physical quantity

40:26.939 --> 40:28.305
and distance.

40:30.108 --> 40:33.042
The truth is...

40:33.044 --> 40:36.111
I don't anticipate
that much distance

40:36.113 --> 40:38.379
between me and Paige
moving forward.

40:38.381 --> 40:40.381
A friend told me
distance

40:40.383 --> 40:42.116
wasn't a good idea,
and I agree.

40:43.953 --> 40:45.185
CHET:
Hey, guys!

40:45.187 --> 40:47.153
Stick around
for the second show?

40:47.155 --> 40:49.155
We've seen enough
train wrecks in one day.

40:49.157 --> 40:50.923
Now, that's funny.
