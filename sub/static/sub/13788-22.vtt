WEBVTT

00:06.507 --> 00:08.679
Hey, Stan.
I'm home from school.

00:08.679 --> 00:09.760
How was your day?

00:09.760 --> 00:11.262
Amazing.

00:11.262 --> 00:12.513
Your mom walked through
a huge spider web

00:12.513 --> 00:14.095
with her mouth open
in the yard.

00:14.095 --> 00:15.266
She totally freaked.

00:15.266 --> 00:16.517
( screams )

00:16.517 --> 00:18.769
"Spider in my mouth!
Spider in my mouth!"

00:18.769 --> 00:19.900
( laughs )

00:19.900 --> 00:21.772
It wasn't in her mouth.

00:21.772 --> 00:24.275
It was in her hair.

00:24.275 --> 00:26.277
ELLEN: Ah! Ah!
Spider in my hair!

00:26.277 --> 00:27.318
Spider in my hair!

00:27.318 --> 00:29.820
Oh, she found it.

00:29.820 --> 00:31.242
And how was your day?

00:31.242 --> 00:32.823
Fantastic!

00:32.823 --> 00:36.287
Today in bio, we learned
about photosynthesis.

00:36.287 --> 00:40.161
It's how plants make
their own food in their bodies.

00:40.161 --> 00:42.713
Whoa! Do they make
bacon in their bodies?

00:42.713 --> 00:43.714
You're thinking of a pig.

00:43.714 --> 00:46.257
I certainly am.

00:46.257 --> 00:49.510
Just every day
I learn something new.

00:49.510 --> 00:52.633
And sure, I could just
read or look things up online.

00:52.633 --> 00:55.386
But being there
just makes it come alive.

00:55.386 --> 00:57.308
So it's like the difference
between reading a play

00:57.308 --> 00:58.519
and going to the theater.

00:58.519 --> 00:59.730
Yes, Stan. Exactly.

00:59.730 --> 01:01.352
Well, what's that like?

01:01.352 --> 01:02.353
'Cause I've never done
either of those.

01:02.353 --> 01:04.565
It's like school.

01:04.565 --> 01:06.026
Wow!

01:08.529 --> 01:10.741
STAN: Avery makes
school sound so exciting.

01:10.741 --> 01:13.284
Too bad the rules say
dogs can't go.

01:13.284 --> 01:15.326
Good thing the rules
don't apply to a dog

01:15.326 --> 01:17.328
with a back-to-school outfit.

01:20.911 --> 01:22.833
Just your typical
middle school student,

01:22.833 --> 01:27.708
cruising in a little late
'cause he chased the wrong bus.

01:27.708 --> 01:32.012
Who can give an example
of symbolism in the novel?

01:32.012 --> 01:34.845
Anyone who hasn't answered
the last ten questions?

01:36.597 --> 01:38.219
Come on, anyone?

01:38.219 --> 01:41.932
Cassidy, Cole, Dan,

01:41.932 --> 01:44.605
Lindsay, Max,

01:44.605 --> 01:47.228
Jack, Ben,

01:47.228 --> 01:50.991
dog, Leslie, Sarah?

01:50.991 --> 01:53.033
Anyone know the answer?

01:53.033 --> 01:57.037
And anyone know why
there's a dog in my class?

01:57.037 --> 01:59.370
Oh,
I know the answer to that.

02:00.831 --> 02:03.123
I am so sorry, Mr. Starr.

02:03.123 --> 02:04.375
This is my dog.

02:04.375 --> 02:06.006
And I know
what you're thinking.

02:06.006 --> 02:08.629
Of course,
it's Avery's dog.

02:08.629 --> 02:10.381
He was raising his paw.

02:12.213 --> 02:13.844
Sorry about that.

02:13.844 --> 02:16.016
Imitation is the sincerest
form of flattery.

02:16.016 --> 02:18.719
Who were you imitating?

02:18.719 --> 02:20.391
No one.
I'll get him out of here.

02:23.264 --> 02:26.106
Too bad it's just Avery's dog
in street clothes.

02:26.106 --> 02:28.269
I was hoping the school
finally had a teen wolf.

02:28.269 --> 02:31.272
Another disappointment.

02:31.272 --> 02:32.693
Without a teen wolf,
our basketball team

02:32.693 --> 02:34.154
will never win
the playoffs.

02:34.154 --> 02:35.536
Talk about disappointment.

02:55.256 --> 02:56.507
Hey, sweetie.
Do you want a snack?

02:56.507 --> 02:57.718
I want a boyfriend.

02:57.718 --> 02:59.139
How about a fruit leather?

03:00.511 --> 03:02.303
Tyler has a girlfriend,
Avery had a boyfriend,

03:02.303 --> 03:04.104
now I want one.

03:04.104 --> 03:05.766
Sweetheart,
I think you're a little young

03:05.766 --> 03:06.897
for a boyfriend.

03:06.897 --> 03:08.229
Besides, when I was a girl

03:08.229 --> 03:09.480
and decided
I wanted a boyfriend,

03:09.480 --> 03:11.902
it took me 2 years
to finally get one.

03:11.902 --> 03:14.114
You can't just say you want
a boyfriend and go out

03:14.114 --> 03:15.946
and get a boyfriend
just like that.

03:15.946 --> 03:18.869
How'd you get a boyfriend
just like that?

03:18.869 --> 03:20.451
Well, nice to meet you,
young man.

03:20.451 --> 03:22.583
So, boyfriend, huh?

03:22.583 --> 03:24.915
It was a little weird
the first time I heard it, too,

03:24.915 --> 03:27.588
but you get used to it.

03:27.588 --> 03:28.999
But just like that, Chloe?

03:28.999 --> 03:30.381
Walk me through it.

03:30.381 --> 03:31.962
You just asked him
and he said yes?

03:31.962 --> 03:33.594
I didn't ask him,
I told him.

03:33.594 --> 03:35.095
"Mason,
you're my boyfriend."

03:35.095 --> 03:36.387
And then I gave him
one of these.

03:38.389 --> 03:41.392
I should have tried that.

03:41.392 --> 03:43.474
Plus, she gave me
cutsies in the lunch line,

03:43.474 --> 03:44.725
so I kind of owed her.

03:44.725 --> 03:45.976
Front cutsies.

03:45.976 --> 03:48.399
These are all really
good pointers.

03:48.399 --> 03:49.940
Ellen, you do realize

03:49.940 --> 03:51.902
you are never
going to be dating again?

03:51.902 --> 03:53.404
Particularly
as a second grader?

03:53.404 --> 03:55.025
I know, I know.

03:55.025 --> 03:57.618
It's just fun to think about
in an aching,

03:57.618 --> 04:00.411
unresolved
past issues kind of way.

04:00.411 --> 04:01.572
Let me fix you
kids a snack.

04:01.572 --> 04:03.414
Ehh,
you sit down and relax.

04:03.414 --> 04:04.785
I'll do it.

04:04.785 --> 04:06.577
Thank you.
That's so gallant.

04:06.577 --> 04:08.369
I'm gonna go put
my backpack away.

04:08.369 --> 04:09.420
You sit down and relax.

04:09.420 --> 04:10.791
I'll do it.

04:10.791 --> 04:12.873
Thank you.
That's so gallant.

04:12.873 --> 04:15.175
What's "gallant"?

04:15.175 --> 04:17.217
It's considerate
and respectful.

04:17.217 --> 04:18.258
Oh, he's supes gallant.

04:20.301 --> 04:24.385
Hey, how'd I end up
back in here?

04:24.385 --> 04:25.806
Come on, let's go play.

04:27.688 --> 04:29.390
He's so cute.

04:29.390 --> 04:31.852
Do you think he's the one?

04:31.852 --> 04:34.315
Honey, they're just
modeling our behavior.

04:34.315 --> 04:36.236
It's perfectly normal
childhood role-playing.

04:36.236 --> 04:37.488
It doesn't mean anything.

04:37.488 --> 04:39.109
So did you have a girlfriend
in second grade?

04:39.109 --> 04:40.611
Oh, yeah.

04:40.611 --> 04:42.363
In fact, she gave me
front cutsies in the lunch line.

04:42.363 --> 04:44.955
How does everyone
know about this but me?

04:49.289 --> 04:52.082
Avery, I'm sorry about
sneaking into your class.

04:52.082 --> 04:53.834
But I learned so much.

04:53.834 --> 04:55.676
Mostly by sniffing
all of the students.

04:55.676 --> 04:57.297
Did you know
a lot of the kids in your class

04:57.297 --> 04:58.549
are night bathers?

04:58.549 --> 05:00.841
Whew!

05:00.841 --> 05:02.973
I'm sorry you can't go
to school, Stan.

05:02.973 --> 05:05.636
I know how I'd feel
if I couldn't go to school.

05:05.636 --> 05:08.349
Although there's no way
they could keep me out.

05:08.349 --> 05:10.190
I'd tunnel, I'd skydive,

05:10.190 --> 05:14.274
I'd learn French foot fighting
and kick my way in.

05:14.274 --> 05:15.566
That's weird.

05:15.566 --> 05:17.358
I spend a lot of
my time figuring out

05:17.358 --> 05:19.400
how not to go to school,
though I wouldn't mind

05:19.400 --> 05:20.781
if it was to learn
French foot fighting,

05:20.781 --> 05:22.112
'cause that sounds awesome.

05:23.494 --> 05:24.905
Hey, you know what?

05:24.905 --> 05:27.247
There was this kid
last year, Andy,

05:27.247 --> 05:29.620
who was stuck at home
with two broken legs.

05:29.620 --> 05:30.911
Did he do it
French foot fighting?

05:30.911 --> 05:31.912
No.

05:31.912 --> 05:33.333
Maybe. I don't know.

05:33.333 --> 05:36.547
The point is he had a robot
that filled in for him

05:36.547 --> 05:38.048
while his legs were broken.

05:38.048 --> 05:39.670
So the robot
did all his fighting?

05:39.670 --> 05:40.761
No.

05:40.761 --> 05:43.384
Maybe. No!

05:43.384 --> 05:44.925
It went to school
for the kid.

05:44.925 --> 05:46.767
He interacted through
a tablet computer

05:46.767 --> 05:48.469
that was attached
to the robot.

05:48.469 --> 05:50.230
It was like
Andy was really at school

05:50.230 --> 05:51.852
doing all the work
himself.

05:51.852 --> 05:55.566
So it was a nerd robot
who was afraid to fight.

05:58.358 --> 06:01.482
Stan, if we can get
that robot from school,

06:01.482 --> 06:04.985
I can enroll you and we can
go to school together.

06:04.985 --> 06:07.408
I'll get to share
my favorite thing, school,

06:07.408 --> 06:08.789
with you, my best friend.

06:08.789 --> 06:10.160
That sounds great.

06:10.160 --> 06:11.251
Yeah!

06:11.251 --> 06:12.332
We can have
snacks together.

06:12.332 --> 06:13.333
I love snacks.

06:13.333 --> 06:14.625
We can walk
to class together.

06:14.625 --> 06:15.996
I love walks.

06:15.996 --> 06:17.337
We can meet up
and study together.

06:17.337 --> 06:18.839
I love meat!

06:18.839 --> 06:22.302
Please, please, please,
Avery, get me that robot.

06:22.302 --> 06:24.134
I want it more than
anything.

06:24.134 --> 06:26.346
Except maybe
a custom closet remodel.

06:26.346 --> 06:27.428
Half of my suits
are folded.

06:27.428 --> 06:29.600
What am I, a farmer?

06:29.600 --> 06:31.812
We'll just have
to make up some story

06:31.812 --> 06:34.224
about why you can't
physically be at school.

06:34.224 --> 06:36.226
We could say your parents
are astrophysicists

06:36.226 --> 06:38.228
in Antarctica and they're
studying gamma ray bursts

06:38.228 --> 06:39.359
and you can't
go to school there

06:39.359 --> 06:40.821
because there are no schools.

06:40.821 --> 06:42.943
Great idea.
Where did that come from?

06:42.943 --> 06:44.575
Like I said, I spend
a lot of time figuring out

06:44.575 --> 06:45.576
how to get out of school.

06:45.576 --> 06:47.197
Just couldn't figure out

06:47.197 --> 06:49.159
how to get Mom and Dad
to be astrophysicists.

06:49.159 --> 06:50.831
No matter
how much I hinted.

06:50.831 --> 06:55.415
So... stars are pretty
interesting, huh?

07:04.424 --> 07:05.425
You okay in there, Stan?

07:05.425 --> 07:07.427
This shoe bin
is the perfect place

07:07.427 --> 07:09.259
to control the robot from.

07:09.259 --> 07:11.932
I'm at school
and surrounded by old shoes.

07:11.932 --> 07:13.934
It's like
a dream come true.

07:13.934 --> 07:16.647
Luckily not the dream where
I show up with no pants on.

07:16.647 --> 07:19.650
Oh, no!

07:19.650 --> 07:21.441
I still think
it'd be safer

07:21.441 --> 07:23.443
for you to control the robot
from home.

07:23.443 --> 07:24.905
No way.

07:24.905 --> 07:26.617
I want to be at school
so I'm closer to you.

07:26.617 --> 07:28.949
The whole point is that
we're sharing this, right?

07:28.949 --> 07:31.241
Plus, I'd get way
too distracted at home.

07:31.241 --> 07:33.333
Your mom's been
learning Swedish.

07:33.333 --> 07:35.706
( speaking
in foreign language )

07:35.706 --> 07:38.248
My gums bleed
when I brush my teeth.

07:40.460 --> 07:41.461
Why is she--

07:41.461 --> 07:42.713
Not flossing regularly?

07:42.713 --> 07:45.586
Yeah, I wondered that, too.

07:45.586 --> 07:47.427
So we ready
for my big entrance?

07:47.427 --> 07:49.800
Let me turn this thing on.

07:55.435 --> 07:57.307
Stan.

07:57.307 --> 07:58.398
Very cool music.

07:58.398 --> 08:00.100
First day of school

08:00.100 --> 08:01.732
and you're really
making your mark.

08:01.732 --> 08:03.443
Nice entrance, Stan.

08:03.443 --> 08:04.775
Now let's introduce you
to everybody.

08:04.775 --> 08:07.568
Where'd you get
the picture of this kid?

08:07.568 --> 08:09.369
He's one of
my BMX buddies.

08:09.369 --> 08:10.280
He goes to another school.

08:10.280 --> 08:11.742
I bought him
some mint ice cream

08:11.742 --> 08:13.323
in exchange
for taking his picture.

08:15.666 --> 08:17.117
Kind of sad.

08:17.117 --> 08:18.579
Still eats ice cream
like a 5-year-old.

08:18.579 --> 08:20.541
You do not want to see
what he does with pudding.

08:22.502 --> 08:24.384
I said
you didn't want to see it.

08:24.384 --> 08:26.677
Sorry, sorry.

08:26.677 --> 08:29.550
Oh, no, did Andy
break his legs again?

08:29.550 --> 08:31.181
That kid's got
to stop trying to jump off

08:31.181 --> 08:33.513
the top bunk
into his pants.

08:33.513 --> 08:36.597
Oh, no,
this is the new virtual student.

08:36.597 --> 08:39.479
He lives with his parents
at a research station

08:39.479 --> 08:40.981
in Antarctica.

08:40.981 --> 08:42.563
Oh,
so you're distant and cold.

08:42.563 --> 08:45.235
I'm Max.

08:45.235 --> 08:46.777
Hi. I'm Lindsay.

08:46.777 --> 08:48.278
STAN: I'm Stan.

08:48.278 --> 08:50.571
Stan, uh, Shoe Bin.

08:50.571 --> 08:52.452
Stan Shubin.

08:52.452 --> 08:54.414
Yeah, that sounds like a name
and not just a hiding place.

09:01.712 --> 09:03.584
Normally I don't go
for showboats,

09:03.584 --> 09:06.376
but this Shubin kid is just
the right amount of wrong.

09:11.341 --> 09:17.437
So Romeo and Juliet,
much like my life, is a tragedy,

09:17.437 --> 09:19.269
although
Romeo and Juliet never lived

09:19.269 --> 09:21.561
in their more successful
brother's garage.

09:23.443 --> 09:25.445
I'm really pulling for him
for Teacher of the Year.

09:25.445 --> 09:27.898
This is his time.

09:27.898 --> 09:30.450
Is this brother's garage thing
gonna be on the test?

09:30.450 --> 09:32.993
Yes.

09:32.993 --> 09:34.615
Isn't this great, Stan?

09:34.615 --> 09:35.786
We're gonna spend
the next hour

09:35.786 --> 09:37.658
learning about
Romeo and Juliet

09:37.658 --> 09:40.751
and then you and I can continue
the discussion on our own time.

09:40.751 --> 09:43.373
STAN: Yes! Finally
I get to do this with you.

09:43.373 --> 09:45.666
Let the excitement begin.

09:45.666 --> 09:48.629
And then Juliet said:
"Wilt thou be gone?

09:48.629 --> 09:50.631
It is not yet near day.

09:50.631 --> 09:53.804
It was the nightingale
and not the lark

09:53.804 --> 09:56.266
that pierced the fearful
hollow of thine ear."

09:56.266 --> 09:57.978
This is so moving.

09:57.978 --> 09:59.099
I'm crying.

09:59.099 --> 10:00.220
Aren't you?

10:00.220 --> 10:02.352
( Stan snores )

10:02.352 --> 10:04.815
Stan!
No sleeping in class.

10:04.815 --> 10:07.607
What?
I wasn't asleep.

10:07.607 --> 10:09.109
Maybe I'm just hungry.

10:09.109 --> 10:10.360
Is it okay
if I get a snack?

10:14.324 --> 10:16.406
No eating in class,
Mr. Shubin,

10:16.406 --> 10:17.998
unless you brought
enough for everyone.

10:24.374 --> 10:26.416
Shoot,
I broke the tip of this one.

10:26.416 --> 10:28.378
Here,
I'll sharpen it for you.

10:28.378 --> 10:30.250
Thanks. So gallant.

10:30.250 --> 10:32.212
I'm really glad you
told me I'm your boyfriend

10:32.212 --> 10:33.633
and then gave me
one of these.

10:35.846 --> 10:37.467
I'll go get us
some snacks.

10:37.467 --> 10:39.970
But I should warn you,
I'm a terrible cook.

10:42.102 --> 10:44.975
Bennett, I appreciate
that you're doing the dishes,

10:44.975 --> 10:46.767
but you're getting
water everywhere.

10:46.767 --> 10:48.028
What are you, seven?

10:48.028 --> 10:49.229
I'm just trying to help.

10:49.229 --> 10:50.480
By making
more work for me?

10:50.480 --> 10:51.822
It's like you don't care.

10:51.822 --> 10:53.363
I don't,
yet I'm still doing it,

10:53.363 --> 10:55.986
which makes me
really special.

10:55.986 --> 10:59.369
And I'm the one stuck
cleaning up your special mess.

10:59.369 --> 11:00.660
But it's fine, it's fine.

11:03.413 --> 11:06.246
I sharpened all the crayons
so they're nice and pointy,

11:06.246 --> 11:07.627
like you like them.

11:07.627 --> 11:10.050
Mason, there are shavings
everywhere.

11:10.050 --> 11:11.381
What are you, seven?

11:11.381 --> 11:13.673
Next month.

11:13.673 --> 11:15.505
And look at your pants.

11:15.505 --> 11:17.257
There's crayon
all over them.

11:17.257 --> 11:19.890
It's like you don't care.

11:19.890 --> 11:21.641
But it makes them colorful.

11:21.641 --> 11:23.353
I have rainbow pants.

11:23.353 --> 11:25.475
I thought you'd like that.

11:25.475 --> 11:28.859
But I'm the one stuck
cleaning up your rainbow mess.

11:28.859 --> 11:31.441
But it's fine, it's fine.

11:31.441 --> 11:34.484
That's good, that's good.

11:34.484 --> 11:37.117
No, it's not good.
We're fighting.

11:37.117 --> 11:38.739
Is it about my pants?

11:38.739 --> 11:40.580
I don't understand.

11:40.580 --> 11:43.323
I don't understand either,
but this is what's happening.

11:46.286 --> 11:48.749
Tyler,
I do not like school.

11:48.749 --> 11:50.330
Avery made it sound
so exciting,

11:50.330 --> 11:51.882
but it's just not for me.

11:51.882 --> 11:54.044
I'm a dog,
I want to take naps

11:54.044 --> 11:56.636
and have yard time
and catch frisbees.

11:56.636 --> 11:58.258
That sounds awesome.

11:58.258 --> 11:59.890
Maybe I'm a dog, too.

12:01.261 --> 12:03.053
What do I do about Avery?

12:03.053 --> 12:05.225
She's so excited
about our doing this together.

12:05.225 --> 12:07.307
Just tell her.
She'll understand.

12:07.307 --> 12:09.940
She knows no one else loves
school the way she does.

12:09.940 --> 12:13.403
Stan, it means so much to me
to finally have someone else

12:13.403 --> 12:15.315
who loves school
the way I do.

12:15.315 --> 12:17.067
Yeah, about that,

12:17.067 --> 12:18.568
there's something
I have to tell you.

12:18.568 --> 12:21.361
I signed us up to do
the history project together.

12:21.361 --> 12:24.284
Oh, this is going to be
so amazing for our friendship.

12:24.284 --> 12:25.285
I don't really share
a love of school

12:25.285 --> 12:26.576
with Max and Lindsay.

12:26.576 --> 12:28.999
It's so great
this can be our thing.

12:28.999 --> 12:30.580
So what was it you
were going to tell me?

12:30.580 --> 12:35.255
Uh, how great it is that
we share our love of school.

12:35.255 --> 12:37.798
We are totally
on the same wavelength.

12:37.798 --> 12:40.340
I'm gonna go right now
and start thinking about--

12:40.340 --> 12:42.512
Lunch meats.
Ideas for the project.

12:50.350 --> 12:52.442
So did you tell
Avery school's not for you?

12:52.442 --> 12:54.654
I couldn't.
She was too excited about

12:54.654 --> 12:56.446
how this was going to be
so great for our friendship.

12:56.446 --> 12:57.858
Well, if you're stuck here,
do what I do.

12:57.858 --> 12:59.659
Make the best of it.

12:59.659 --> 13:01.451
Well, I guess school's
better than sitting at home

13:01.451 --> 13:02.993
hanging out with your mom.

13:04.614 --> 13:05.615
Good one, Shubin.

13:05.615 --> 13:07.457
Yeah, it was.

13:09.910 --> 13:12.042
Bam!

13:12.042 --> 13:15.215
Stand back
while I do a little of this.

13:15.215 --> 13:16.676
Whoa!

13:16.676 --> 13:18.258
( Stan chuckles )

13:18.258 --> 13:19.880
Well,
I better get to bio.

13:19.880 --> 13:21.131
Hey, some of us
are in the same class.

13:21.131 --> 13:22.222
We can all sit in the back

13:22.222 --> 13:23.723
and make fun of
everything together.

13:23.723 --> 13:26.056
You mean
we don't have to learn?

13:26.056 --> 13:28.058
You are on a roll, Shubin.

13:28.058 --> 13:32.062
Yeah, I was like "You mean
we don't have to learn?"

13:32.062 --> 13:34.234
Oh, man.

13:37.317 --> 13:39.359
Tyler, Stan loves school.

13:39.359 --> 13:40.440
Don't try to corrupt him

13:40.440 --> 13:42.282
and turn him
into a slacker like you.

13:42.282 --> 13:44.704
I'm not a slacker.
I have a goal.

13:44.704 --> 13:47.367
To own a food truck
someday.

13:47.367 --> 13:49.369
So I focus
on the things that matter.

13:49.369 --> 13:51.751
Hanging with friends
to develop social skills,

13:51.751 --> 13:55.335
and lunch to develop
lunch skills.

13:55.335 --> 13:58.128
I don't need to know
who invaded Iceland in 1940.

13:58.128 --> 13:59.669
England.
Or who discovered
sun spots.

13:59.669 --> 14:01.051
Galileo.

14:01.051 --> 14:02.302
Or what's
the capital of Bulgaria.

14:02.302 --> 14:03.303
Sofia.

14:03.303 --> 14:04.764
England. Galileo.

14:04.764 --> 14:07.307
Sofia. Thanks.

14:07.307 --> 14:09.679
My point is, what's going
on between you and Stan

14:09.679 --> 14:11.181
has nothing to do with me.

14:11.181 --> 14:12.432
Really.
You should talk to him.

14:12.432 --> 14:13.603
I'm not trying
to teach him

14:13.603 --> 14:15.475
how to live
or what's atomic number five

14:15.475 --> 14:17.397
on the periodic table.
Boron.

14:17.397 --> 14:19.399
Hey, I know we don't see
eye to eye on this school thing,

14:19.399 --> 14:21.821
but that's no reason
for name calling.

14:21.821 --> 14:23.153
You're a boron.

14:28.828 --> 14:31.411
Stan, you were supposed
to be home hours ago

14:31.411 --> 14:32.752
to work on our project.

14:32.752 --> 14:35.085
Sorry, I got caught up
in something.

14:35.085 --> 14:37.667
Tyler and I were hanging out
with the skateboard club.

14:42.002 --> 14:43.303
You got this, Shubin.

14:51.972 --> 14:53.393
I'm good.

14:55.815 --> 14:57.477
The last couple of days,

14:57.477 --> 14:59.359
every time we're supposed
to work on this assignment,

14:59.359 --> 15:01.361
you always have
an excuse not to.

15:01.361 --> 15:03.363
You're right.

15:03.363 --> 15:05.235
After the pep rally tonight,
we'll really buckle down.

15:05.235 --> 15:07.237
No, it's due tomorrow.

15:07.237 --> 15:10.330
We can't go to the pep rally.
We have too much to do.

15:10.330 --> 15:13.373
This does mean as much to you
as it does to me, doesn't it?

15:13.373 --> 15:15.585
Yes, of course.

15:15.585 --> 15:17.747
This is the thing
we have in common.

15:17.747 --> 15:19.339
We'll skip the pep rally

15:19.339 --> 15:21.671
and work all night
or my name isn't Stan Shubin.

15:21.671 --> 15:22.672
It's not.

15:22.672 --> 15:24.594
Right, right.

15:24.594 --> 15:26.046
Sorry, I've been confused

15:26.046 --> 15:27.887
since I took that spill
on my skateboard.

15:27.887 --> 15:29.259
You didn't take the spill.

15:29.259 --> 15:31.601
I told you
I've been confused.

15:31.601 --> 15:34.434
Okay, Stan.
You wait here.

15:34.434 --> 15:36.186
I've got to get some poster
board for the project,

15:36.186 --> 15:38.108
but when I get home,
we'll get to work.

15:38.108 --> 15:41.271
Yes, good,
looking forward to it.

15:41.271 --> 15:42.272
Okay, Stan.
You ready for the rally?

15:42.272 --> 15:43.903
Totally.
Let's get out of here.

15:48.278 --> 15:50.410
Daddy, can you help me?

15:50.410 --> 15:52.782
Mason doesn't want to be
my boyfriend anymore.

15:52.782 --> 15:54.624
Doesn't want to be
your boyfriend?

15:54.624 --> 15:56.576
Did your mother give you
relationship advice?

15:56.576 --> 15:57.877
No.
Okay.

15:57.877 --> 15:59.249
Then maybe
there's a chance.

15:59.249 --> 16:00.580
What happened?

16:00.580 --> 16:02.672
Well, I was the one stuck
cleaning up his mess.

16:02.672 --> 16:04.294
It's like he doesn't care.

16:04.294 --> 16:06.756
But it's fine, it's fine.

16:06.756 --> 16:09.549
Chloe, did you overhear
Mommy and me arguing?

16:09.549 --> 16:12.392
Yes. I hear lots of things
you talk about.

16:12.392 --> 16:14.224
Did you ever think
if you put the ceiling fan in,

16:14.224 --> 16:15.975
she'll stop nagging you?

16:19.559 --> 16:21.691
Stan, I'm home.

16:21.691 --> 16:24.314
Stan.

16:24.314 --> 16:25.525
Stan?

16:27.277 --> 16:28.528
ALL: Shubin!

16:28.528 --> 16:30.450
Shubin! Shubin!

16:30.450 --> 16:33.113
This is so awesome, Stan.

16:35.325 --> 16:37.667
Why aren't you over there?
I thought you liked him.

16:37.667 --> 16:39.499
I just liked him
for his telescoping neck.

16:39.499 --> 16:41.381
He doesn't have
a telescoping neck.

16:41.381 --> 16:42.332
I know that now.

16:42.332 --> 16:43.673
I was just projecting onto him

16:43.673 --> 16:44.964
what I wanted him to be.

16:53.683 --> 16:55.135
What's Mason doing here?

16:55.135 --> 16:56.306
I thought
he broke up with Chloe.

16:56.306 --> 16:57.937
And how could
he do something like that?

16:57.937 --> 16:59.689
I'm beginning to think
he's not the one.

17:01.521 --> 17:04.524
Honey, they were just fighting
because they saw us fighting.

17:04.524 --> 17:06.066
Chloe!

17:06.066 --> 17:08.198
I invited Mason over
so that they could see us

17:08.198 --> 17:11.361
apologize and learn
from our good example.

17:11.361 --> 17:12.412
What's up, Daddy?

17:12.412 --> 17:13.953
What's she doing here?

17:13.953 --> 17:15.535
I live here.

17:15.535 --> 17:18.328
You see
what I'm dealing with?

17:18.328 --> 17:23.373
Guys, I know that you saw us
having a little disagreement,

17:23.373 --> 17:26.426
but what you didn't see
was the part where we made up.

17:26.426 --> 17:27.627
So...

17:27.627 --> 17:29.759
So...

17:29.759 --> 17:33.553
So Chloe's mommy has something
she wants to say to me.

17:33.553 --> 17:36.306
I thought
you were gonna start.

17:36.306 --> 17:38.638
Hey,
there's a picture of you.

17:38.638 --> 17:42.182
I live here.

17:42.182 --> 17:45.235
We have to pretend
to apologize,

17:45.235 --> 17:46.566
even if we don't mean it.

17:46.566 --> 17:48.358
Fine.

17:48.358 --> 17:50.950
Bennett,
I'm sorry I criticized

17:50.950 --> 17:52.322
the way
you did the dishes.

17:52.322 --> 17:55.405
And, Ellen, I am sorry
for making a mess

17:55.405 --> 17:56.576
for you to clean up.

17:56.576 --> 17:58.077
I was just
trying to help out

17:58.077 --> 18:00.290
because I know how much
you do around here.

18:00.290 --> 18:02.412
Really?
Yeah.

18:02.412 --> 18:03.873
Aw, I'm sorry
for jumping on you

18:03.873 --> 18:05.755
when you were
just trying to help out.

18:05.755 --> 18:07.627
I'm sorry for not chipping
in more around the house.

18:07.627 --> 18:09.469
Aw.

18:09.469 --> 18:11.381
Does that mean you're going
to start chipping in more

18:11.381 --> 18:13.213
or you're just sorry
that you don't?

18:13.213 --> 18:16.346
We'll talk later.

18:16.346 --> 18:18.218
Mason, I'm sorry
for yelling at you

18:18.218 --> 18:19.389
about the crayons.

18:19.389 --> 18:21.100
Chloe, I'm sorry, too,

18:21.100 --> 18:23.223
even though I don't know
what I did wrong.

18:23.223 --> 18:24.524
Better get used
to that, buddy.

18:26.226 --> 18:28.067
What's your backpack
doing here?

18:28.067 --> 18:30.230
I live here!

18:35.034 --> 18:36.696
There you are.

18:36.696 --> 18:39.829
Max and Lindsay texted me
all about how Stan Shubin

18:39.829 --> 18:42.242
was showing off at the rally
by the shoe bin.

18:42.242 --> 18:44.454
And how has no one made
that connection?

18:44.454 --> 18:46.546
Oh, you mean
the sneaker box?

18:48.338 --> 18:50.210
Stan bailed
on our project tonight.

18:50.210 --> 18:51.711
I just can't believe
you took him there

18:51.711 --> 18:54.214
after I specifically
asked you to stay out of this.

18:54.214 --> 18:56.426
First, when have
I ever done anything

18:56.426 --> 18:58.308
you specifically
asked me to do?

18:58.308 --> 19:00.310
And second,
I did stay out of it.

19:00.310 --> 19:01.681
He wanted to go.

19:01.681 --> 19:02.932
Hey, I guess
I did something

19:02.932 --> 19:04.394
you specifically
asked me to do.

19:04.394 --> 19:06.896
This is a big day for you.

19:06.896 --> 19:08.898
Wait, where's Stan?

19:08.898 --> 19:10.610
I'm right here.

19:10.610 --> 19:12.362
No, that's Shubin.

19:12.362 --> 19:14.113
I want to talk to Stan.

19:14.113 --> 19:18.328
Stan's a little afraid
to talk to you right now.

19:18.328 --> 19:20.450
Stan, I'm so mad at you.

19:20.450 --> 19:22.622
Now you're making me
more nervous.

19:22.622 --> 19:24.624
Man,
hitting all the wrong buttons.

19:27.587 --> 19:29.249
Huh, that must be in there
from the last time

19:29.249 --> 19:30.500
a cow couldn't go
to school.

19:32.382 --> 19:34.003
Ding dong.

19:34.003 --> 19:35.465
Who's there?
Who's there?

19:35.465 --> 19:36.556
Who's--

19:36.556 --> 19:38.928
Ah, you doorbelled me.

19:38.928 --> 19:41.351
Nice.

19:41.351 --> 19:44.764
Stan, you went
to the rally tonight.

19:44.764 --> 19:46.356
You knew
how much working together

19:46.356 --> 19:47.937
on our project
meant to me.

19:47.937 --> 19:49.899
It was something
we were gonna share.

19:49.899 --> 19:53.403
I tried, but I just don't care
about school the way you do.

19:53.403 --> 19:54.904
I'm a dog.

19:54.904 --> 19:57.407
I want to take naps
and have yard time

19:57.407 --> 19:59.239
and sniff your mom's
left ankle every day

19:59.239 --> 20:01.951
for no reason
until she developed a complex.

20:01.951 --> 20:03.243
( chuckles )

20:03.243 --> 20:06.125
She made
a doctor's appointment.

20:07.627 --> 20:09.999
Oh, my gosh.

20:09.999 --> 20:12.502
I blamed Tyler for putting
the pressure on you

20:12.502 --> 20:15.755
to slack off, but I was
the one putting pressure

20:15.755 --> 20:17.927
on you to be like me.

20:17.927 --> 20:20.260
I'm so sorry.

20:20.260 --> 20:22.802
But if you felt that way,
why didn't you say anything?

20:22.802 --> 20:25.305
Seeing how excited
you were about us having school

20:25.305 --> 20:28.898
in common made me realize
that our personalities

20:28.898 --> 20:30.610
and interests
are so different.

20:30.610 --> 20:32.352
We don't really have
anything in common.

20:32.352 --> 20:34.354
That's what this is about?

20:34.354 --> 20:37.407
What if our friendship
isn't really based on anything?

20:37.407 --> 20:40.360
I guess I was trying to run away
from having to face that.

20:40.360 --> 20:43.363
Stan, our friendship
is based on the fact

20:43.363 --> 20:45.415
that we love each other

20:45.415 --> 20:47.246
and are always there
for each other.

20:47.246 --> 20:49.329
That's all that matters.

20:49.329 --> 20:50.420
It is?

20:50.420 --> 20:52.372
Isn't it all that
matters to you?

20:52.372 --> 20:54.424
It is.

20:54.424 --> 20:55.755
I love you, Avery.

20:55.755 --> 20:57.877
I love you, too, Stan.

21:03.473 --> 21:07.477
Hey, Shubin's giving us
the side-eye.

21:07.477 --> 21:09.309
Who's controlling it?

21:10.850 --> 21:13.853
( both screaming )

21:16.656 --> 21:18.107
Good work, Shubin.

21:24.243 --> 21:25.665
After we discovered
that our neighbor

21:25.665 --> 21:27.997
Mr. Trummer's
TV remote operated

21:27.997 --> 21:30.209
on the same frequency
as the robot,

21:30.209 --> 21:34.504
we were no longer afraid
to go back in the house.

21:34.504 --> 21:36.836
And it turns out
that my going to school

21:36.836 --> 21:39.178
did bring Avery and me
closer together,

21:39.178 --> 21:41.971
just not in the way either
of us thought it would.

21:41.971 --> 21:44.684
And I'm back to my naps
and my yard time

21:44.684 --> 21:46.426
and my fun with Ellen.

21:46.426 --> 21:49.268
But, Doctor Landers, what do
you mean the tests show nothing?

21:49.268 --> 21:51.020
There has to be something.

21:51.020 --> 21:53.813
Why else would the dog
be sniffing that one spot?

21:53.813 --> 21:56.436
I've been sniffing it, too,
and it does smell sick.

21:59.238 --> 22:01.651
Tomorrow,
I start barking at it.
