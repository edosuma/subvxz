00:34.760 --> 00:39.530
hi.My name's  charles
bartowski,but you can call me  uck.

00:39.590 --> 00:40.980
Those are my shoes.

00:41.040 --> 00:42.480
This is my life.

00:42.520 --> 00:47.320
It's filled  with spies,car chases,computer-stealing
ninjas  and me saving the day.

00:47.360 --> 00:50.010
Oh,wait,wait. I o ed tgo back.

00:50.080 --> 00:51.510
I work at the buy more.

00:51.570 --> 00:53.830
It used to be pretty boring.

00:54.350 --> 00:57.460
Chuck! Get overhere! Now!

00:57.580 --> 00:59.580
Look at this. What happened?

00:59.580 --> 01:01.020
Well,wayto go,jeff.

01:01.090 --> 01:03.250
You do realize we don't
workfor large mart.

01:03.310 --> 01:04.140
They're our competition.

01:04.209 --> 01:10.520
Can you imagine the shameif sommarge rt fiend or
costco stoogeput out a display on our buy more green?

01:10.560 --> 01:12.650
So this has tocome down,right?

01:12.740 --> 01:14.830
Yesterday.

01:15.130 --> 01:19.250
I now present to youthe
magic... of morgan.

01:20.000 --> 01:23.100
this is my best friend,morgan.
He is not a magician.

01:23.170 --> 01:24.630
Voila!

01:28.460 --> 01:32.680
See,everything changed  when I got an e-mail
from my old college buddy  bryce larkin.

01:32.740 --> 01:36.700
You see,bryce had been working for the cia when
he stwhe a ole bunch of government secrets--

01:36.730 --> 01:40.430
big important secrets,really
scary,nasty,get-killed-for-having-them secrets.

01:40.510 --> 01:44.930
Next thing I know,these ecpersrets
are downloaded into my brain,

01:44.980 --> 01:47.270
which means every moment lf myife...

01:48.170 --> 01:49.250
is in danger.

01:49.310 --> 01:51.060
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:51.060 --> 01:53.940
The nsa sent their top
agent to protect me.

01:53.980 --> 01:56.280
That's casey. He's pretty scary.

01:56.320 --> 01:58.330
He works at buy more now,cas aover.

01:58.380 --> 02:01.340
So now I must defend the
country from assassins...

02:01.370 --> 02:02.580
no,casey!

02:02.640 --> 02:05.220
...Terrorists...  ...

02:08.490 --> 02:09.770
and shoplifters.

02:09.810 --> 02:12.570
Casey,casey,casey. No,no,no,no,no.
No,no,no,no. It's just a video game,okay?

02:12.600 --> 02:15.610
Lives are not in danger,and
the countryis still safe.

02:17.520 --> 02:20.670
This guy's been here24 hours and he's
taking the job waymore seriously than me.

02:20.730 --> 02:21.950
That's becausehe's crazy.

02:22.020 --> 02:23.730
Tell me somethingI don't know.

02:23.770 --> 02:26.770
Oh,hey,dawg. Nice to
see you again,pal. Huh?

02:26.770 --> 02:28.270
You're not so tough now,are you?

02:28.330 --> 02:30.260

02:40.200 --> 02:41.450
Sarah?

02:41.520 --> 02:44.980
The cia sent their tot,agen too.

02:51.200 --> 02:53.740
Oh,yeah,I know. Believe me.

02:54.380 --> 02:55.960
She told me to trust her.

02:56.010 --> 03:00.180
But just like any
woman,she's got a past.

03:03.190 --> 03:07.020
and... she's posing  as my girlfriend.

03:11.320 --> 03:13.820
sarah,what,uh... at
awhre you doing here?

03:13.900 --> 03:16.750
I work here now,chuck.

03:16.840 --> 03:19.610
Oh,damn.

03:19.680 --> 03:20.900
I burned another batch.

03:20.960 --> 03:23.310
Why are you working here?

03:23.350 --> 03:24.400
Surveillance.

03:24.440 --> 03:28.580
I can monitor the buy more
from here while you work.

03:28.610 --> 03:30.400
It's just a cover.

03:30.430 --> 03:32.640
Right,yllh,a part of the plan.
'Cause there's a plan,right?

03:32.860 --> 03:37.930
I mean,uh,you making gourmet wieners isn't
exactly the reason why you joined the cia,

03:37.990 --> 03:42.940
and casey isn't a natural-born appliance salesman,and the
whole kinda government-secrets-locked- in-my-brain thing,

03:43.020 --> 03:48.350
uh,that's,I'm sure,not really a boon for national security,so I'm
hoping,I mean,I'm hoping that you'll tell me that there's a plan?

03:48.420 --> 03:49.980
We have a plan.

03:50.020 --> 03:51.350
There is somebody who can help.

03:51.400 --> 03:53.620
We can discuss it further tonight.

03:53.660 --> 03:56.900
How about another date?
I can pick you up at 8:00.

03:57.800 --> 04:02.970
Yeah. Yeah,that sounds... I'd like that.
That sounds great. I'll,uh,I'll see you.

04:09.080 --> 04:10.280
chuck is in.

04:10.340 --> 04:12.290
Send the doctor.

04:13.420 --> 04:15.000
Hey,sis,what do you think of this shirt?

04:15.060 --> 04:17.670
Another date with sarah.
This is very exciting.

04:17.670 --> 04:22.940
-Well,see,it's not that big a deal.
-Yes,it is. Hey,she is hot.

04:22.990 --> 04:24.100
Jeepers.

04:24.160 --> 04:26.140
I'd go with the first shirt,too. It
looks really nice with your skin tone.

04:26.140 --> 04:26.780
Oh,yeah?

04:26.840 --> 04:29.240
Wait a minute-- morgan
has met her,and I haven't?

04:29.290 --> 04:31.970
Well... yeah,he confides
in me,ellie. You know?

04:32.020 --> 04:36.550
He-he tells me his deepest,darkest
secrets,which,you could,too,by the way.

04:36.610 --> 04:37.980
Here's one: I loath you.

04:38.020 --> 04:40.270
That's not a secret.

04:40.310 --> 04:43.320
I need to meet this girl.
Tomorrow night. Dinner. Here.

04:44.630 --> 04:46.760
A little too soon to be seeing
the tron poster,don't you think?

04:46.820 --> 04:49.620
Not exactly a natural aphrodisiac.

04:49.940 --> 04:52.740
Dinner. Perfect. I'll clear my schedule.

04:55.310 --> 04:59.910
Our most valuable secrets
have been sent to an idiot.

04:59.950 --> 05:02.870
Well,at least they
weren't sent to his friend.

05:02.940 --> 05:04.890
"Operation chuck.

05:04.970 --> 05:05.990
" I can't believe this.

05:06.030 --> 05:07.850
I spoke with agent walker.

05:07.890 --> 05:10.500
She'll deliver chuck to
the rendezvous tonight.

05:10.540 --> 05:13.580
Good. Dr.  Zarnow's
on his way to L.A. Now.

05:13.580 --> 05:15.880
He is our best,nsa's top scientist.

05:15.930 --> 05:18.650
Well,I hope he can fix this.

05:22.450 --> 05:23.260
Get in.

05:23.270 --> 05:25.220
Wienerlicious really pays well,huh?

05:26.420 --> 05:30.740
Uh,what are we,uh,what are we doing? We're
going to,uh,like,a movie or some dinner?

05:30.740 --> 05:32.670
Not exactly.

05:32.730 --> 05:36.900
What,what does,what does
"not exactly" mean,exactly?

05:40.720 --> 05:41.920
So.

05:41.990 --> 05:44.560
Here we are on ourdate at the buy more.

05:44.620 --> 05:47.860
Is this all partof the plan or a
chance for meto clock in some overtime?

05:47.920 --> 05:49.570
There's a doctor comingto see you,chuck.

05:49.610 --> 05:54.780
He worked on theencoding process for the intersect,the
computerthat bryce destroyed,the one that'sin your head.

05:54.820 --> 05:56.150
He's comingto examine you.

05:56.230 --> 06:03.800
Uh-huh,uh,and-and doesthis examination involve,say,I
don't know,needles orperhaps probing of some kind?

06:03.850 --> 06:07.740
The doctor is our best
shotat helping you.

06:08.140 --> 06:10.050
It's what you want,right?

06:10.110 --> 06:12.790
To get the secretsout of your head.

06:13.390 --> 06:14.960
Yeah. Yeah,of course.

06:15.760 --> 06:20.340
But you-you still... you're still being very vagueabout
the probing,and I'd liketo know the answer to that.

06:20.400 --> 06:23.680
We've rewired the hometheater
room for this test.

06:23.740 --> 06:27.380
When the images start,just
say what they are.

06:27.440 --> 06:28.430
That's it?

06:28.500 --> 06:30.900
I'm sure you'll finda
way to screw it up.

06:30.960 --> 06:32.210
The doctor's here.

06:32.270 --> 06:33.940
- When do I getto meet him?
-You don'T.

06:33.970 --> 06:36.490
It's importantthat he doesn't
see you. You're too valuable.

06:36.530 --> 06:40.050
Thanks. I'm flattered
and totallyfreaked out.

06:43.820 --> 06:44.900
Dr.  Zarnow?

06:44.960 --> 06:46.490
Agent casey.

06:46.570 --> 06:47.310
Agent walker.

06:47.370 --> 06:49.800
Thank you for meetingus
at a neutral site.

06:49.860 --> 06:51.700
Let's begin.

06:52.140 --> 06:54.810
I don't understand whyI
can't see my patient.

06:54.850 --> 06:59.160
For your safety,we're
keepingpatient x's identity a secret.

06:59.190 --> 07:01.110
Does patient x work here?

07:01.170 --> 07:05.620
Patient x--who knows all the
intersect secrets--works in a buy more?

07:05.670 --> 07:07.820
Ridiculous. Of course.

07:09.420 --> 07:12.450
After the tone,the test will begin.

07:12.960 --> 07:15.710
uh... dog.

07:16.070 --> 07:18.330
Uh,hippopotamus.

07:18.400 --> 07:20.680
Fat guy.

07:20.740 --> 07:23.060
Ugly building.

07:25.450 --> 07:28.650
Really beautiful womanat the beach.

07:31.340 --> 07:35.320
Cardinal oneis the top moscow spy
in the white house office of...

07:35.360 --> 07:37.890
the plot to assassinatepresident
carter was orchestrated by...

07:37.960 --> 07:42.460
northrop davis voting computers has
been approved  by the dnc,rnc and cia.

07:42.520 --> 07:46.240
Oceanic flight 815 was shot downby
surface-to-air...  work on subterranean...

07:46.320 --> 07:49.240
beneath denver international
airport has reached phase four.

07:49.300 --> 07:53.640
Benedictine agents within the vatican report...  ...assassin
still active...   ...been approved by the dnc,rnc and cia.

08:05.630 --> 08:08.420
scenario five is... okay,well,that'sjust
a picture of a turtle.

08:08.470 --> 08:11.950
Your patient is phenomenal.

08:12.010 --> 08:13.500
We never imagined this.

08:13.540 --> 08:15.580
What didn't you imagine?

08:15.610 --> 08:18.610
One person seeing
allthe intersect images.

08:18.670 --> 08:21.780
All our secrets in one mind.

08:21.860 --> 08:24.970
Can you remove the secrets,doctor?

08:26.790 --> 08:30.770
Yes. I think I can.

08:35.070 --> 08:37.049
So,did I pass the test?

08:37.130 --> 08:38.530
You did great,chuck.

08:38.590 --> 08:42.630
And this doctor guy--he
can fix me or...?

08:42.690 --> 08:45.710
Uh,he's hopeful,yeah.

08:46.920 --> 08:48.710
Okay.

08:50.310 --> 08:52.050
Oh,uh,I almost forgot.

08:52.140 --> 08:57.320
Uh... dinner tomorrow nightwith my
sister and her boyfriend captain awesome.

08:57.390 --> 08:59.520
She really wanted to meet you.

08:59.660 --> 09:00.740
Okay,well,that's a good idea.

09:00.820 --> 09:06.920
Meeting the family'skind of a big step
if our relationshipwere remotely real.

09:10.560 --> 09:17.590
so,uh,if this wholeexamination thing,if it
works out,then I guess...we're through,huh?

09:17.640 --> 09:19.220
Uh,yeah. Mm-hmm.

09:23.730 --> 09:27.200
-Okay. Well,good night.
-Good night.

09:27.250 --> 09:37.630
Oh,and,uh... just so you know... um... tonight wasprobably
the best... only second dateI've been on in years.

09:40.260 --> 09:42.160
Drive safe.

10:29.280 --> 10:30.490
Did you see this?

10:30.530 --> 10:31.660
Atwh?

10:31.720 --> 10:34.050
Did you know thatbryce was dead?

10:35.650 --> 10:38.040
No. No,I didn'T.

10:39.980 --> 10:42.340
Well,are you okay?

10:42.360 --> 10:43.630
I don't know.

10:43.670 --> 10:45.470
Um... yeah,I don't know. It's crazy.

10:45.490 --> 10:51.060
I,uh,I spent somuch time hating him
for getting mekicked out of stanford,

10:51.090 --> 10:55.100
I don't know,really,how to feel,but
it's hard to bemad at him now.

10:55.140 --> 10:57.610
I'm reallysorry,chuck.

11:03.830 --> 11:05.820
Yeah,ey's cas. I'm at the scene.

11:05.860 --> 11:08.280
No sign of zarnow's
body. Probably vaporized.

11:08.540 --> 11:12.020
I guess those secrets are
staying in chuck's head.

11:21.450 --> 11:24.690
Well... no sign of anything here.

11:24.740 --> 11:27.240
It looks like we're sending
thegood doctor home in an ashtray.

11:27.280 --> 11:29.110
Okay,well,I've got hot dogs to fry.

11:29.150 --> 11:32.110
And I've got some toastersto sell.

11:52.730 --> 11:54.500
Feels like a cia job to me.

11:54.560 --> 11:56.170
Keep your eye on agent walker.

11:56.230 --> 11:59.740
And don't let chuck out of
your sight. He could be next.

12:00.180 --> 12:02.280
The strong barsare getting
a little sticky. On... on one.

12:02.340 --> 12:05.030
On theother one,it's
fine,but on the second...

12:05.670 --> 12:06.500
you can't trust her.

12:06.540 --> 12:10.390
-Chuck. John.
-Big mike. Big mike!

12:10.440 --> 12:12.270
How's customer service training?

12:12.310 --> 12:13.200
-Fine.
-Super.

12:13.490 --> 12:14.660
Glad to hear it.

12:14.740 --> 12:16.670
The better my employees,the
less I have to work.

12:16.710 --> 12:18.070
Very inspiring words,sir.

12:18.150 --> 12:20.590
Regular call to arms.

12:21.450 --> 12:22.700
Well,go make 'em better.

12:22.740 --> 12:25.040
Show me you're
assistantmanager material.

12:25.110 --> 12:27.820
Chop-chop! I got a napin an hour.

12:28.170 --> 12:30.810
-Good-bye.
-Good-bye.

12:30.820 --> 12:33.660
So,uh,this isthe hand-held scanner.

12:34.020 --> 12:35.540
Very expensivepiece of equipment.

12:35.590 --> 12:39.110
So is a stealth fighter
andsomehow I managed to fly that.

12:39.170 --> 12:43.230
Right,uh,and the gun,you
know,kind of works like A...

12:43.260 --> 12:44.800
-gun?
-Uh-huh.

12:44.840 --> 12:47.890
And it beepswhen you scan the barcodes.

12:48.050 --> 12:51.260
well,if screamed out
loud,I'd be right at home.

12:51.450 --> 12:55.510

private meetingswith sarah,hmm?

12:55.590 --> 12:57.820
Um,is there...is there a problem?

12:57.890 --> 13:01.250
No problems,only solutions.

13:01.300 --> 13:08.010
well,that... sounds very much likethe buy more customer
policy that I've noticedyou have some issue with.

13:12.790 --> 13:15.570
Anowyou kn,uh... you know what
I thinkwe're gonna do about that?

13:15.650 --> 13:20.570

13:35.970 --> 13:37.840
Got it from here.

13:57.440 --> 13:59.240
there you go.

14:02.840 --> 14:06.110
so,chuck,no private
meetingswith casey today.

14:06.180 --> 14:07.490
What? What is it upwith you guys?

14:07.490 --> 14:09.270
Did he tell youthe same thing?

14:09.310 --> 14:10.370
Right,of course he did.

14:10.430 --> 14:11.600
Hold on a second. Is something wrong?

14:11.620 --> 14:15.680
The doctorfrom last night-- he was killed
in an explosionsoon after he left us.

14:15.740 --> 14:16.930
Wha-what?

14:16.970 --> 14:19.200
The doctor who wassupposed to fix me?

14:19.480 --> 14:21.480
Tell me what this is.

14:22.160 --> 14:23.730
A... a nasty...

14:27.250 --> 14:28.660
nsa incinerator.

14:28.700 --> 14:32.290
Special issue designed
toeliminate all biological traces.

14:33.010 --> 14:34.170
That's what killed the doctor.

14:34.210 --> 14:37.170
And guess who worksfor the nsa?

14:37.330 --> 14:40.610
-Why... why,why would casey...
- he's a killer,chuck.

14:40.690 --> 14:42.080
It's what he doesfor a living.

14:42.090 --> 14:44.850
He tried to kill us,and he'll
probably try to do it again.

14:44.910 --> 14:46.130
Maybe it was orders.

14:46.210 --> 14:48.630
Maybe he didn't like  the
way zarnow looked at him.

14:48.690 --> 14:50.900
Oh,that's nice. I feel
much better now,sarah.

14:50.990 --> 14:52.110
What am I supposed to do?

14:52.190 --> 14:56.010
You go back in there and you
pretend likeyou know nothing.

14:56.070 --> 14:58.700
Go. You can do that,chuck.

14:59.460 --> 15:01.000
I know nothing.

15:01.060 --> 15:03.470
I know nothing,I... got it.

15:03.510 --> 15:05.260
All right,so I'm gonna try again. Ready?

15:05.270 --> 15:07.820
Do you have any ramones?

15:07.840 --> 15:09.780
No,don't say no. It's
not gonna...listen,okay.

15:09.870 --> 15:14.470
Uh,excuse me,john. How you doing?
Do you have any ramoneshere,dude?

15:14.480 --> 15:15.220
Don't tell meyou don't have any.

15:15.280 --> 15:20.800
Casey,the...the correct response
is "can we order youthe ramones?

15:20.850 --> 15:22.850
" Ramones,man,ramones. Okay,just
lookingfor the ramones,man.

15:22.960 --> 15:25.950
Do you have ramones?
'Cause I love ramones... ow!

15:26.930 --> 15:29.240
That's a "no"on the ramones,I guess.

15:29.320 --> 15:32.800
Okay,I don't thinkthat's
in the buy more manual.

15:32.900 --> 15:35.050
What did sarah tell you?

15:35.640 --> 15:39.120
I know you talked to her.
It's what I dofor a living.

15:43.800 --> 15:47.810
oh,no,here it is,on the
bottom shelf: Ramones.

15:52.630 --> 15:53.820
-There you go.
-Thanks.

15:53.820 --> 15:56.050
-Bye.
-I love you.

16:00.370 --> 16:01.470
What did you tell chuck?

16:01.510 --> 16:04.270
That you're a
cold-bloodedkiller. Was I lying?

16:04.310 --> 16:05.320
No.

16:05.370 --> 16:09.120
The way I figure it,the only two people that
knew the doctorwas coming are right here.

16:09.160 --> 16:11.610
Since I didn't cap
him,you're under arrest.

16:54.350 --> 16:55.440
quick,take a pic.

16:55.500 --> 16:57.990
She's so hot. Did you get it? Come on.

16:58.030 --> 16:59.940
Let's go put iton the internet.

17:09.500 --> 17:11.829
-Mr.  Bartowski.
-Hi lester.

17:11.910 --> 17:13.430
Uh,code zebra.

17:13.500 --> 17:16.569
Linux install at afactory
off ventura. 142 euclid.

17:16.619 --> 17:19.640
Uh... I'm sorry. Why-why
can't you and jeff go?

17:21.410 --> 17:26.589

guys,chuck. We're... we're it artists.

17:26.960 --> 17:29.320
Okay. Yeah. Uh... fine,whatever.

17:29.350 --> 17:30.570
I'll be back in half an hour.

17:30.640 --> 17:33.460
And,uh,just tell
caseythat I'm on my cell.

17:33.500 --> 17:34.810
You tell him. I'm not your servant.

17:34.840 --> 17:35.990
-Okay,youknow what...
- no,no,I mean,I'm gonna tell him.

17:36.060 --> 17:38.760
I just,you know,I mean,in
general,I don't always...

17:38.810 --> 17:42.480
absolutely,I'm going to...
right now,should I tell him?

17:56.020 --> 17:57.460
-hello?
-Pull over.

17:57.490 --> 17:58.760
Well,I can't pull over.

17:58.820 --> 18:02.040
-I have a home install at,uh...
-142 euclid?

18:02.100 --> 18:04.090
Guess who called that in?

18:05.100 --> 18:08.200
Oh,my god. It was you!

18:08.200 --> 18:11.230
You killed the doctor,and
now you're here to kill me!

18:37.220 --> 18:39.690
are you out of your mind?

18:40.120 --> 18:42.750
What... what... what...
what happened to you?

18:42.800 --> 18:43.610
Your girlfriend happened.

18:43.680 --> 18:46.060
-What,who,sarah?
-She's rogue,chuck.

18:46.110 --> 18:48.190
She killed the doctor,then
she tried to kill me.

18:48.250 --> 18:49.470
Is she okay?

18:49.510 --> 18:50.660
Yeah,I'm golden. Thanks for asking.

18:50.700 --> 18:51.920
No,no,no,why should I believe you?

18:52.000 --> 18:53.430
She showed me the bomb.
She saidyou did it.

18:53.640 --> 18:55.170
Nsa incinerator,right?

18:55.210 --> 18:58.420
It's a niceexplosive easily
purchasedon the black market.

18:58.500 --> 19:01.190
What do you really
knowabout sarah,chuck,huh?

19:01.250 --> 19:02.180
Think.

19:02.240 --> 19:03.320
She's cia.

19:03.390 --> 19:04.800
She workedwith bryce.

19:04.830 --> 19:06.910
He was rogue. Maybe she is,too.

19:06.970 --> 19:08.020
She found you in L.A.

19:08.070 --> 19:10.840
,But she couldn't grab
you because I was around.

19:10.890 --> 19:12.710
So she had to wait her chance.

19:12.750 --> 19:14.600
Dr.  Zarnow screwed that up.

19:14.650 --> 19:19.960
He could pull those secrets out of your head,then
she loses the intersect,so she had to act fast.

19:28.800 --> 19:31.600
let's go. Come on.

19:35.190 --> 19:36.160
thought I turnedthat off.

19:36.220 --> 19:38.440
Well,it's not me. Is it yours?

19:38.550 --> 19:40.630
no.

19:42.560 --> 19:44.910
nsa incinerator! Run!

19:45.100 --> 19:47.760
casey! Casey!

20:09.340 --> 20:11.090
You're nervouscooking,babe. Relax.

20:11.120 --> 20:13.150
Devon,this dinnerhas to go well.

20:13.200 --> 20:14.720
It's going to be awesome.
You don't know chuck.

20:14.950 --> 20:16.990
He freaks outwhen he likes a girl.

20:17.040 --> 20:19.280
Yeah,ain't thatthe truth,huh?

20:19.340 --> 20:21.130
You know practicemakes perfect.

20:21.160 --> 20:22.410
How did you get in here?

20:22.480 --> 20:24.110
Uh,chuck's window.

20:24.170 --> 20:26.520
Or,as I like to callit,the morgan door.

20:26.580 --> 20:29.340
I got to lock the window.
I wonder wherechuck is.

20:30.700 --> 20:32.870
Still thinkit was me?

20:32.910 --> 20:34.460
:Why would sarah do this?

20:34.510 --> 20:36.770
She's cleaningthe operation.

20:37.730 --> 20:38.680
:Cleaning?

20:38.740 --> 20:41.270
Eliminating everyoneshe's
come in contact with.

20:41.330 --> 20:43.210
You know where she is?

20:44.710 --> 20:46.700
We have to get back to my house.
She's having dinnerwith us tonight.

20:46.770 --> 20:48.380
No,kid,you're on the
next plane to washington.

20:48.430 --> 20:50.970
-But my sister...
- doesn't have a super computerin her noggin.

20:51.030 --> 20:52.620
You're the priority.

20:52.680 --> 20:55.070
It's casey. Put me
through to general... hey!

20:57.430 --> 20:59.140
Hey!

20:59.360 --> 21:01.200

21:11.700 --> 21:13.270
Chuck.

21:13.350 --> 21:14.640
Where have you been?

21:14.680 --> 21:16.020

21:16.090 --> 21:18.200

21:18.240 --> 21:20.240
What?

21:21.260 --> 21:23.120
-Where's casey?
-I don't know.

21:23.180 --> 21:25.590
Maybe he's havingsome car trouble.

21:26.310 --> 21:27.010
Everyone okay?

21:27.090 --> 21:29.570
Yeah,just a little
hungry,dude. You're late.

21:29.600 --> 21:31.170
And dirtyfor my taste.

21:31.250 --> 21:34.890
And your girlfriend has been
just nothing but mean to me.

21:36.610 --> 21:38.330
Look out for her.

21:38.410 --> 21:40.750
So I'm glad everyone'sgetting
along so well.

21:40.810 --> 21:42.760
Yeah,your sister is awesome.

21:42.850 --> 21:44.250
Indeed.

21:44.330 --> 21:46.300
Hey! I've got an idea.

21:46.420 --> 21:50.500
Why don't we actually go
out,huh,for pizzaor something,

21:50.560 --> 21:54.420

21:54.480 --> 21:56.800
Uh,chuck,I've beencooking all day.

21:56.850 --> 22:00.610
Yeah,cooking pot

22:00.680 --> 22:02.950
Manzoom,manjo. Let's eat.

22:03.030 --> 22:06.130
Sit down,okay? It'll be good.

22:06.290 --> 22:08.820
Lady. Looks great,baby.

22:09.250 --> 22:10.660
This looksdelicious,ellie.

22:10.700 --> 22:12.780
Oh,it was nothing.

22:12.820 --> 22:16.090
So,sarah,let's turn this
up a notchpersonal style.

22:16.140 --> 22:17.270
Tell us somethingabout yourself.

22:17.330 --> 22:20.450
Well,I'm originallyfrom
D.C. I just moved here.

22:20.820 --> 22:22.490
Oh,chuck hada friend from D.C.

22:22.550 --> 22:23.890
A former friend.

22:23.950 --> 22:28.390
You know,former because a: He was
a jerk,and b: He'S...well,he's dead.

22:28.460 --> 22:31.700
The girl chuck wasdating
before you-- he stole her.

22:31.750 --> 22:35.960
Ugh,I just don't know howanyone
could choose bryce over chuck.

22:38.910 --> 22:42.830

I thought I mightbring something over.

22:42.850 --> 22:44.560
Ow,come in.

22:44.600 --> 22:46.590
Chuck,you didn't tell meyou're
bringing another friend.

22:46.630 --> 22:49.400
Hey. Hi. Yeah.

22:49.480 --> 22:55.830
It totally slipped my mind that my friend,john
casey,was coming over,and we work atbuy more together.

22:55.900 --> 22:57.720
Morgan,you know johnfrom buy more.

22:57.760 --> 23:00.920
I was telling him we weregonna have a get-together
and that,you know,the more,the merrier.

23:00.990 --> 23:03.710
You pull a stuntlike that
again,I'll kill youbefore she can.

23:04.630 --> 23:05.840
You kidder.

23:05.900 --> 23:07.190
Chuck,we're goingto need another chair.

23:17.140 --> 23:18.750

nsa ran a checkon sarah walker to see what we
had... two years ago,she posedas a french diplomat.

23:28.530 --> 23:30.760
Infiltrated the
innercircle of an arms deal.

23:30.840 --> 23:32.440
Killed the entire circle.

23:32.480 --> 23:33.460
With a bomb?

23:33.500 --> 23:34.970
We don't know.

23:35.030 --> 23:37.590
Her alias was elana truffaut.

-At dinner.

25:22.110 --> 25:24.020

25:54.260 --> 25:59.570

25:59.790 --> 26:03.240
Um,you know what? Let me talk to him.

26:07.250 --> 26:10.540
Casey,hey,maybe,uh...

26:10.880 --> 26:12.500

26:12.560 --> 26:15.030
Nothing. Everything's okay.

26:15.820 --> 26:18.210
makeup sex. Nice.

26:19.040 --> 26:20.140
what did he tell you?

26:20.210 --> 26:24.160
That you killed Dr.  Zarnow and
poisoned a bunchof french diplomats.

26:24.210 --> 26:25.300
They're blaming me for zarnow?

26:25.340 --> 26:27.400
If you're planning on
hurtingme,even to prove a point,

26:27.450 --> 26:29.870
I think you should know I have
a very low thresholdfor pain.

26:29.920 --> 26:31.440
And you believe casey?

26:31.500 --> 26:34.510
Tell me aboutthe french diplomats.

26:34.580 --> 26:37.290
They were french assassins,and they
were after me,but I got to them first.

26:37.320 --> 26:39.290
And you know what? I'm
kinda glad that I did.

26:39.310 --> 26:41.690
Chuck,do you really
thinkthat my name is sarah?

26:41.750 --> 26:44.660
I never asked youto believe
me. I asked youto trust me.

26:45.440 --> 26:46.260
This doesn't make sense.

26:46.340 --> 26:50.000
If casey didn't kill zarnow,then...

26:50.840 --> 26:51.870
what are you doing?

26:51.880 --> 26:53.580
I have to go right now.

26:54.760 --> 26:55.420
Uh,I'm sorry.

26:55.430 --> 26:57.760
I have to go,but dinn won wasderful.

26:59.180 --> 27:00.930
Gotta go.Be back.

27:00.940 --> 27:03.180
Yeah,well,I betterbe going,too.

27:03.190 --> 27:04.690
This has beengreat.Thanks.

27:04.980 --> 27:07.480
Uh... you're welcome.

27:08.760 --> 27:09.960
I think that went well.

27:09.970 --> 27:11.750
You know,not great,but
I think it went well.

27:12.170 --> 27:16.840
So,uh,I'm gonna makea little doggy
bag and head out my morgan door.

27:16.850 --> 27:17.730
How about that?

27:17.740 --> 27:19.950
Sounds good? Super-duper.

27:21.810 --> 27:23.030
Sarah,wait!

27:23.040 --> 27:25.030
You stay inside.

27:25.040 --> 27:26.290
Do what I say.

27:31.190 --> 27:32.520
Do you think we were wrong?

27:35.100 --> 27:36.350
Casey!

27:38.660 --> 27:40.510
hey,don't move.

27:41.460 --> 27:42.560
Zarnow?

27:45.240 --> 27:47.670
good to see you again,agent casey.

27:54.790 --> 27:55.900
oh,my god.

27:55.910 --> 27:58.170
Yep,we were wrong.

28:03.410 --> 28:04.940
Casey,he's got sarah.We've
got to save her.

28:04.950 --> 28:06.520
Brilliant deduction,nancy drew.

28:06.530 --> 28:07.920
Now pull out the tranq dart!

28:08.500 --> 28:10.390
Oh,I have a very
strongaversion to needles.

28:10.400 --> 28:11.250
Do it!

28:11.260 --> 28:13.340
Okay,uh,here we go.

28:15.250 --> 28:17.240
that was the doctor,right?
He's probably not dead?

28:17.760 --> 28:18.960
And the sun sets in the west.

28:18.970 --> 28:20.160
Nothing gets by you.

28:20.170 --> 28:21.350
One,two,three.

28:24.130 --> 28:25.110
what's he gonnado with sarah?

28:25.410 --> 28:29.900
He's gonna torture her until
she tells himall about you.

28:30.790 --> 28:31.550
Come on.

28:31.560 --> 28:32.950
If we hurry,we can catch him.

28:32.960 --> 28:39.520
All right,where are we going?

28:39.530 --> 28:43.170
I laced my quicheswith microbots.

28:43.610 --> 28:44.840
You're not kidding,are you?

28:44.850 --> 28:46.880
I don't kid about quiche.

28:46.890 --> 28:49.020
We can trace himusing the car's tracker.

28:49.030 --> 28:51.330
Yeah,I think that only
comeswith the sports package.

28:52.080 --> 28:54.690
We made some enhancementswhen
your car was in the shop.

28:56.520 --> 28:57.520
Got a signal.

28:57.530 --> 28:58.410
Let's go.

29:10.480 --> 29:12.100
Hey,casey,casey.

29:12.110 --> 29:12.840
Wait a minute.

29:12.850 --> 29:14.550
Why,why would hebring sarah here?

29:14.560 --> 29:15.470
I don't know.

29:15.480 --> 29:16.730
You wait here.

29:18.910 --> 29:20.480
damn tranq dart.

29:22.460 --> 29:23.060
come on.

29:23.070 --> 29:24.350
Oh,god.

29:28.810 --> 29:30.150
hey,wait,you idiot!

29:37.590 --> 29:38.910
It's morgan.

29:38.920 --> 29:40.490
He ate your quiches.

29:41.020 --> 29:42.560
We're onthe wrong trail.

29:44.250 --> 29:45.610
Come on.

29:51.350 --> 29:52.310
I got nothing.

29:52.320 --> 29:53.180
What do you meanyou got nothing?

29:53.190 --> 29:54.250
Then what do we do?

29:54.670 --> 29:55.840
It's over.She's gone.

29:55.850 --> 29:56.690
No,no,no,no,no.

29:56.700 --> 29:58.030
Okay,this is our fault.

29:58.040 --> 29:58.950
We didn't believe her.

29:58.960 --> 30:00.180
Now we have to save her.

30:00.650 --> 30:03.640
Look,if you were a bad guy,what
would you do,fly sarah outon a plane?

30:03.650 --> 30:06.140
Would you use a
boator a-a-a what?

30:06.150 --> 30:07.300
Chopper.

30:07.310 --> 30:09.150
Small airfieldnear the water.

30:09.490 --> 30:10.800
The closest I could find.

30:10.810 --> 30:13.180
Then do-do a satellite
searchusing the touch screen

30:13.190 --> 30:16.680
and then maybe limit thatto airfields
that are withina certain range of us

30:16.690 --> 30:20.250
and then maybe limit that by if
there's activityon the ground?

30:20.610 --> 30:22.030
That's not bad.

30:22.040 --> 30:22.820
Thanks.

30:22.830 --> 30:26.180
Yeah,I was just kindof,you
know,spitballing,just kind oftop of my head.

30:26.190 --> 30:27.480
I was thinking...found it.

30:27.490 --> 30:28.610
Port of los angeles.

30:29.070 --> 30:30.020
Floor it.

30:30.030 --> 30:31.220
Okay.

30:38.980 --> 30:40.420
This is how this is gonna work.

30:40.780 --> 30:42.500
I'm gonna go over there,rescue sarah,

30:42.510 --> 30:45.800
and capture Dr.Zarnow,shoot
anybody who gets in my way.

30:46.650 --> 30:48.200
You,you're gonna stay here.

30:48.210 --> 30:50.770
So,in this planI basically do nothing?

30:52.100 --> 30:53.440
Yep.

30:53.450 --> 30:54.980
Let's do this.

31:01.950 --> 31:04.180
All right,all right.

31:04.650 --> 31:06.000
Now we wait.

31:11.650 --> 31:12.950
Stay in the car.

31:12.960 --> 31:14.220
Stay in the car.

31:14.680 --> 31:15.920
Do not leave the car.

31:15.930 --> 31:18.200
Do not leave this car.

31:43.800 --> 31:45.710
sarah,are you okay?

31:46.030 --> 31:47.340
:What are you doing here?

31:47.350 --> 31:48.150
Stupid question.

31:48.160 --> 31:50.110
Okay,uh,should I...?

31:51.520 --> 31:52.370
Sorry.

31:52.380 --> 31:53.860
Chuck,you have to get out of here.

31:53.870 --> 31:54.740
No,I'm here to save you.

31:54.750 --> 31:56.490
You shouldn't even be
here;you're too valuable,

31:56.500 --> 31:58.290
and,besides,I have this well in hand.

31:58.300 --> 31:59.960
Uh-huh,yeah,'cause
it looks well in hand.

31:59.970 --> 32:02.060
Just find me somethingto pick this lock.

32:02.070 --> 32:04.450
I don'T... okay,here.

32:09.200 --> 32:10.130
go,go,go!

32:10.140 --> 32:11.870
The tape,the tape.

32:23.870 --> 32:26.350
The helicopter's ready,agent walker.

32:26.860 --> 32:29.000
This is your last chance.

32:33.020 --> 32:37.120
We're going toa special facility
where they're goingto torture you.

32:37.630 --> 32:41.400
Really torture,not this child's play.

32:41.650 --> 32:47.680
Or you couldjust tell
me who is patient X.

32:49.770 --> 32:51.980
Somethingfor the flight.

32:52.530 --> 32:54.000
Oh,crap.

32:54.010 --> 32:54.990
Run!

32:55.000 --> 32:56.340
Oh,crap.

33:05.690 --> 33:06.850
I know you.I know your secret.

33:06.860 --> 33:09.990
You-you've been feedingamerican
science to north korea for years.

33:11.040 --> 33:13.900
Ah,patient X.

33:13.910 --> 33:17.690
To think that my secretsare
in that head of yours.

33:17.700 --> 33:19.740
It's an honor,really.

33:19.750 --> 33:22.190
Of course,to hell with honor.

33:22.200 --> 33:26.620
I'm here for the impressivedollar
figure the human intersectwill fetch.

33:26.630 --> 33:29.460
Who will I offer you to first?

33:34.060 --> 33:36.800
sarah... sarah...

33:39.030 --> 33:40.560
don't worry,agent walker.

33:40.570 --> 33:42.470
I'll take goodcare of him.

33:57.230 --> 33:58.730
No,casey,don't shoot.They have chuck.

33:58.740 --> 34:00.620
Proceed to bravo coordinates.

34:00.630 --> 34:02.420
The ship will bewaiting there.

34:02.430 --> 34:04.050
It's about ten miles offshore.

34:04.060 --> 34:05.610
15-minute flight.

34:20.699 --> 34:21.810
Don't move!

34:23.580 --> 34:25.280
You must be kidding.

34:28.480 --> 34:30.110
I want you to landthe
helicopter right now.

34:31.210 --> 34:32.949
It's heavier than you thought.

34:32.960 --> 34:34.010
What?

34:34.020 --> 34:35.130
The gun.

34:35.139 --> 34:36.500
It's heavy.

34:40.219 --> 34:41.650
Don'T... don't!

34:41.659 --> 34:42.820
Give me back the gun.

34:42.830 --> 34:43.870
I'm not giving you the gun!

34:48.900 --> 34:50.929
you shot the pilot,you idiot!

34:50.940 --> 34:52.350
I didn't mean to do that.

34:52.360 --> 34:53.780
What's happening?

34:54.460 --> 34:55.870
Who's flying this thing?

34:56.489 --> 34:58.270
You're goingto kill us both.

34:59.400 --> 35:00.930
Come on,chuck.

35:01.040 --> 35:02.460
let me go.

35:06.070 --> 35:07.350
get your hands off of me!

35:07.360 --> 35:08.670
Get off of me!

35:17.130 --> 35:18.110
oh,god.

35:18.120 --> 35:19.490
That's a crane.

35:23.310 --> 35:25.920
Oh,my god,casey,I thinkchuck's
flying the chopper.

35:37.130 --> 35:38.370
Yeah,I'm here.

35:38.380 --> 35:39.930
I told you to stay in the car.

35:39.940 --> 35:40.740
You know what? Forget about the car.

35:40.750 --> 35:42.230
Tell me how to fly a helicopter.

35:42.960 --> 35:46.290
All right,there's a
collectivein the cyclic control.

35:46.300 --> 35:47.080
What?

35:47.090 --> 35:49.790
One's the stick.One looks
likean emergency brake.

35:49.800 --> 35:51.060
Grab 'em both.

35:51.830 --> 35:54.020
Okay,okay,I got it.

35:56.580 --> 35:58.080
This is not working!

35:58.090 --> 36:02.560
Push the stickjust a bit forward while
doing the same thingwith the emergency brake.

36:06.590 --> 36:07.550
ground--
not good.

36:07.560 --> 36:09.000
Pull up! Pull up!

36:09.010 --> 36:10.710
Pull up on the emergency brake!

36:11.700 --> 36:14.020
Level off.Level off!

36:14.770 --> 36:16.910
I don't know how.I don't
know how to level off!

36:16.920 --> 36:19.010
Listen,moron,you want to die?

36:19.600 --> 36:21.950
Casey,put sarah on the phone.

36:21.960 --> 36:23.510
Give me thephone,casey.

36:23.520 --> 36:24.870
Here.

36:25.710 --> 36:27.700
Okay... uh,chuck,you're goinge to bokay.

36:27.710 --> 36:29.400
Now,I need you to focus.

36:29.410 --> 36:31.750
Uh,have you ever playedany
flying games before?

36:31.760 --> 36:32.680
Flight simulators? Yeah.

36:32.690 --> 36:34.770
Flight simulators?
Yeah,sure,I've done those,yeah.

36:35.280 --> 36:36.580
Okay,which ones?

36:36.980 --> 36:41.300
Uh,maverick of the skies...
uh,stealth fighter elite...

36:41.310 --> 36:42.980
uh,apache chopper patrol.

36:42.990 --> 36:43.710
Great.

36:43.720 --> 36:45.000
Okay,now rememberthat last one.

36:45.010 --> 36:47.630
I want you to pretend likeyou're
playing that game,okay.

36:47.640 --> 36:51.430
You're just in your bedroom,you're
playing a game,and none of this is real.

36:54.690 --> 36:55.940
it's just a game.

36:57.170 --> 36:58.410
It's just a game.

36:58.420 --> 37:00.350
Okay,I can do this.

37:00.360 --> 37:01.870
I can play this game.

37:02.810 --> 37:04.400
Easy,chuck,easy.

37:06.870 --> 37:09.820
Uh... uh,is thisone of those
helicopters that can turn into a boat?

37:09.830 --> 37:10.800
No,it isn'T.

37:10.810 --> 37:12.470
Just ease tothe right
and goose the brake.

37:12.480 --> 37:14.750
They designed the game
exactly like the helicopter.

37:15.770 --> 37:16.480
I got it.

37:17.250 --> 37:18.570
I got it.

37:19.120 --> 37:20.160
Almost there.

37:20.170 --> 37:21.180
A little more to the right.

37:21.190 --> 37:23.740
Keeping right.Keeping right.

37:24.000 --> 37:25.190
Goosinakthe brE.

37:25.200 --> 37:26.540
It's just a game.

37:26.550 --> 37:28.600
A big scary video game.

37:37.760 --> 37:39.800
oh,thank you,god!

37:41.400 --> 37:43.490
oh,yes!

37:43.500 --> 37:45.470
You are wonderful.

37:50.420 --> 37:53.780
And that is how...I do... that!

37:55.580 --> 37:56.840
That's how we do that.

37:56.850 --> 37:58.340
Go,team.Sarah... see sarah.

37:58.350 --> 37:59.430
Up top on that one.

37:59.440 --> 38:00.610
Palms are a little sweaty,but...

38:00.620 --> 38:02.170
what the hellwere you thinking?

38:02.180 --> 38:03.720
Clammy hands,got it,no good.

38:03.730 --> 38:06.560
Chuck,the secrets that you
knoware incredibly important.

38:06.570 --> 38:08.730
You compromised everything
when you stoppedtrusting me.

38:08.740 --> 38:10.200
And when you gotout of the car.

38:11.910 --> 38:14.390
Listen,I'M... I'm sorry,okay?

38:14.400 --> 38:16.110
No,it is not okay.

38:17.850 --> 38:20.090
How could you thinkI was the double,huh?

38:20.100 --> 38:21.090
You know,I am not bryce.

38:21.100 --> 38:22.850
Bryce betrayed
everythingthat I believe in,

38:22.860 --> 38:25.720
and if you ever accuse meof
that again,then I will walk away.

38:25.730 --> 38:28.000
Mission over.We all
go back to washington.

38:28.370 --> 38:30.720
And you do not want thatto happen,chuck.

38:31.000 --> 38:33.160
That you should trust me on.

38:38.350 --> 38:39.790
Way to go,ace.

38:49.600 --> 38:51.250
Dad's suit?

38:51.790 --> 38:53.020
Yeah.

38:53.380 --> 38:54.950
It's my only one.

38:55.250 --> 38:57.560
I'm quite certain
hewouldn't mind,though.

38:58.570 --> 39:01.840
You realize that you don'thave
to go to bryce's funeral.

39:02.970 --> 39:05.150
Yeah,yeah,I guess.

39:05.160 --> 39:07.330
It's just we had a lot of history.

39:08.280 --> 39:11.430
Even if he did get mekicked out
of school and steal my girlfriend.

39:12.400 --> 39:15.910
Well... you've moved on
to bigger andbetter girls.

39:17.200 --> 39:19.080
I don't really mean
biggerlike,literally bigger.

39:19.090 --> 39:22.380
I just mean that,um...
that I really like sarah.

39:23.380 --> 39:27.240
And I hope you guys work things out 
before the next dinner party,of course.

39:27.250 --> 39:29.560
I don't know...I don't know,sis.

39:29.570 --> 39:32.310
I... I... look,I reallythink I blew it.

39:32.320 --> 39:33.590
Chuck,just try apologizing.

39:33.600 --> 39:35.220
It goes a long way.

39:47.690 --> 39:49.280
Sarah's special.

39:50.070 --> 39:52.300
She's different fromyour
stanford friends.

40:11.720 --> 40:13.970
He flew a helicopter?

40:14.740 --> 40:18.010
Your report was
ratherterrifying,major casey.

40:18.020 --> 40:22.750
Do we really havethe situation in hand,or
should Mr.Bartowskibe in our care full-time?

40:22.760 --> 40:24.610
Well,you know how I feel,general.

40:24.620 --> 40:26.320
But for now,we're in control.

40:26.330 --> 40:28.200
Then chuck stays where he is.

40:28.210 --> 40:31.360
But,uh,don't gettoo comfortable,casey.

40:31.630 --> 40:34.750
The new intersect will be
upand running in six months.

40:35.180 --> 40:37.300
And what happens to
chuckwhen this is done?

40:37.650 --> 40:41.100
Well,you'll dowhat you do best.

40:55.340 --> 40:56.690
knock,knock.

40:57.120 --> 40:59.030
Hey,chuck.

40:59.040 --> 41:00.370
How is everything?

41:00.380 --> 41:01.950
I saw youat the funeral.

41:01.960 --> 41:03.510
Oh,yeah,I had to go.

41:03.940 --> 41:06.520
After everything bryce
did,he was still my partner.

41:06.850 --> 41:10.320
Look,I'm not accusing
youof anything... today.

41:11.320 --> 41:15.060
Yesterday,yes,I may havelaid it on
a little thick with the accusing.

41:16.190 --> 41:17.880
But I'm really sorry about that.

41:18.550 --> 41:21.310
Instead of not trusting you,I should
have been thanking youfor saving my life

41:21.320 --> 41:23.580
and protecting the
countryand-and-and...

41:23.590 --> 41:26.580
and making really tastygourmet wieners.

41:30.630 --> 41:32.040
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

41:32.050 --> 41:32.990
It was our first fight.

41:33.000 --> 41:36.540
You know,it's a big step,if our
relationshipwere remotely real.

41:37.840 --> 41:42.290
You know,with Dr.Zarnowgone,chuck,those
intersect secretsaren't going anywhere.

41:42.300 --> 41:47.100
That means moremissions,more danger,more secrets
that you can't tellyour sister or your friends.

41:47.110 --> 41:48.390
I know that.

41:50.280 --> 41:53.450
Some people want to be heroes
and others have to be asked.

41:54.220 --> 41:56.970
So... chuck,are you ready?

42:02.860 --> 42:04.030
good.

42:06.810 --> 42:08.300
I hope we're notinterrupting anything.

42:09.870 --> 42:14.980
Uh... by the way,I thoughtwe'd give
that dinner another shot,maybe here.

42:15.350 --> 42:16.770
We knew you'dforgive him.

42:16.780 --> 42:20.170
Right,and you realize thatyou
all have to eat my cooking.

42:20.560 --> 42:22.490
Give me the 411on the corn dogs.

42:24.200 --> 42:25.240
What do youthink,man?

42:25.250 --> 42:26.570
What do you recommend,buddy?

42:27.240 --> 42:28.590
