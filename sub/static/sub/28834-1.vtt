01:28.175 --> 01:29.872
Isn't this great?

01:29.915 --> 01:31.874
You can see the whole city
in twenty minutes,

01:31.917 --> 01:34.442
uptown, downtown,
the whole rigmarole.

01:34.485 --> 01:39.186
It would be more enjoyable
if it weren't so freezing.

01:39.229 --> 01:41.492
Yeah, it's a little fresh air.

01:41.536 --> 01:42.406
Ah.

01:43.929 --> 01:48.020
We've been-- We've been
up and down the river twice now.

01:48.064 --> 01:49.892
I feel like
we should call it quits.

01:49.935 --> 01:51.763
Yeah, I wanted to
show you the full circuit.

01:52.808 --> 01:54.636
I'm freezing my face off.

01:54.679 --> 01:56.855
Ah, it's good for you.
It's good for the circulation.

01:56.899 --> 01:59.380
You know, in Sweden they do a lot of
this, the hot, the cold.

01:59.423 --> 02:02.774
- I'm going to go inside.
- Oh no, no, no. We're about to dock.

02:02.818 --> 02:05.125
You can't be outside
for two more minutes?

02:07.649 --> 02:08.737
I could.

02:17.354 --> 02:20.357
Peter, where you going?

02:20.401 --> 02:21.619
Come back.

02:45.861 --> 02:48.559
You know, I'm very sad
you're leaving New York so soon.

02:48.603 --> 02:50.344
It's a real treat
having you around.

02:50.387 --> 02:52.607
- This will be a nice few days together.
- Yeah.

02:52.650 --> 02:54.870
And, uh,
happy to not go to Montreal,

02:54.913 --> 02:57.264
things are a little bit
weird with Vanessa right now.

02:57.307 --> 03:00.484
Can we go to your apartment too,
I'm tired of lugging this bag around.

03:00.528 --> 03:04.358
Oh, yeah sure. No, I just wanted to
give you a tour of the city first.

03:05.620 --> 03:07.709
- Here we are.
- Where?

03:07.752 --> 03:09.711
The bridges. Aren't they great?

03:09.754 --> 03:11.756
Yeah.
They're, they're nice bridges.

03:11.800 --> 03:13.976
You know, I have a real
thing for architecture.

03:14.019 --> 03:16.065
Over two dozen men died
building that bridge.

03:16.108 --> 03:18.241
- Isn't that amazing?
- Yeah, they're, they're impressive.

03:18.285 --> 03:22.071
The man who built that bridge
was afraid of heights.

03:22.114 --> 03:24.334
- Can you imagine that?
- I'm really hungry. Let's go.

03:26.293 --> 03:30.166
Jack always went to this Indian place that's
right next door to another Indian place,

03:30.210 --> 03:33.691
and when you go to one, the other tries
to persuade you to go into theirs.

03:33.735 --> 03:36.868
They're dueling Indian restaurants,
but we have to go to the one on the left.

03:36.912 --> 03:40.263
Generally speaking, I resent it
when someone tries to solicit me.

03:40.307 --> 03:43.832
There, there's this one time at school that
a homeless guy asked my friend for money--

03:43.875 --> 03:47.618
- Where was this?
- At school. This, uh, homeless guy asked my friend for money

03:47.662 --> 03:50.186
and my friend punched him. He punched
him right in the face. I loved that.

03:50.230 --> 03:53.755
- Was he drunk?
- The homeless guy or Owen?

03:53.798 --> 03:57.933
- Who the hell is Owen?
- My friend in the story. You with me?

03:57.976 --> 04:01.241
- He was drunk?
- Owen was sober.

04:01.284 --> 04:03.765
What kind of sick bastards are
you hanging around with, Peter?

04:03.808 --> 04:06.550
College life has really thrown
you for a loop, hasn't it?

04:06.594 --> 04:08.030
I was just saying Owen

04:08.073 --> 04:10.075
that I liked Owen
because he did that.

04:10.119 --> 04:11.686
I thought that was a nice story.

04:11.729 --> 04:14.297
Here we are, home sweet home.

04:14.341 --> 04:15.777
Shoes off.

04:15.820 --> 04:16.995
Uch, really?

04:18.345 --> 04:20.346
Uh, this place is so sad.

04:20.390 --> 04:21.261
Yeah, well.

04:22.653 --> 04:25.134
It's not much, yet.

04:25.177 --> 04:26.048
Nice tree though.

04:28.180 --> 04:31.140
Oh, shit, dammit.

04:32.228 --> 04:33.229
Sorry.

04:34.883 --> 04:37.233
Hey has this place passed the
recent health inspection laws?

04:37.277 --> 04:39.844
You've got a bed
up against the furnace.

04:40.758 --> 04:42.543
Probably a fire hazard.

04:53.118 --> 04:53.989
What?

04:57.340 --> 05:00.909
This is-- I think this is the
nicest fake tree I've ever seen.

05:00.952 --> 05:02.171
There's such detail.

05:05.392 --> 05:06.306
What is that?

05:08.917 --> 05:10.484
I just got this letter.

05:12.181 --> 05:13.748
Ah, I've gotten letters.

05:13.791 --> 05:14.792
Letters are cool.

05:14.836 --> 05:15.793
It's from Jack.

05:17.882 --> 05:19.667
Wait, it's fro-- it's from Jack?

05:21.843 --> 05:24.933
How'd you get a-- how'd you get a letter
from Jack? What are you talking about?

05:25.803 --> 05:30.286
He sent out a bunch of letters
before he died. Maggie got one too.

05:30.330 --> 05:31.809
What?
You haven't checked your mail?

05:31.853 --> 05:33.333
What are y-- How are you t--

05:35.465 --> 05:37.380
I didn't know
that was possible to--

05:39.904 --> 05:41.123
Are you all right?

05:42.820 --> 05:45.867
- Yeah.
- Hey, Max?

05:48.130 --> 05:50.350
What did it say? Wha--
why-- why did he do that?

05:51.786 --> 05:53.527
I don't know.
I'm gonna go freshen up.

05:54.832 --> 05:56.921
- Max?
- Fix the tree, will you?

06:10.805 --> 06:12.197
Hello, my friend.

06:13.677 --> 06:14.852
- Come into this side?
- Sure.

06:17.115 --> 06:21.206
Ah, I think this side.
We're gonna go.

06:21.250 --> 06:22.294
Thank you, sir.

06:24.253 --> 06:27.648
Nobody has the right to take anything
fr-- That's not what I'm saying.

06:27.691 --> 06:30.477
- What are you saying then?
- I'm saying that you have opportunities

06:30.520 --> 06:32.696
more than a lot of people.
You are young. -Okay, okay.

06:32.740 --> 06:34.742
- You are white.
- Okay. I'm-I'm not speaking-- I know--

06:34.785 --> 06:37.092
I know I'm young and white.
I'm not speaking

06:37.135 --> 06:39.486
- of the opportunities of the underprivileged.
- Keep your voice down.

06:39.529 --> 06:42.619
I'm talking about-- I'm talking about
somebody thinking they have a right

06:42.663 --> 06:45.579
to ask me for my money when
they, they don't even know me.

06:45.622 --> 06:48.712
Money that I've earned
in a legitimate way mind you.

06:48.756 --> 06:50.975
Well, you haven't earned it,
cause you don't have a job.

06:51.019 --> 06:53.021
No, I don't have a job.
I don't have a job.

06:53.064 --> 06:55.153
But I'm talking
hypothetically, so humor me.

06:55.197 --> 06:57.591
I think you're scaring 'em.
I think you're scaring these

06:57.634 --> 07:00.158
- women with your loud talk. I'm sorry about--
- I apologize.

07:00.202 --> 07:02.204
He's a loud speaker
and I like to fight him.

07:02.247 --> 07:04.119
It's okay,
we were just talking

07:04.162 --> 07:06.469
- about the ethnicity of the waiter.
- She's racist.

07:06.513 --> 07:09.777
- I'm not racist. It could be a number of countries.
- That's a legit--

07:09.820 --> 07:16.131
I just, uh, let me just say, I feel like this
may be a little strange and I admit that it is,

07:16.174 --> 07:19.264
- but I have a feeling about all of us.
- A feeling?

07:19.308 --> 07:21.571
- Really, what kind of feeling?
- I don't know, just a gut feeling.

07:21.615 --> 07:23.878
- You do this all the time.
- What's that?

07:23.921 --> 07:28.883
This is, uh, you have these very
realistic dreams and just a general...

07:28.926 --> 07:30.493
- It's true. I do.
- General perceptiveness about things...

07:30.537 --> 07:32.408
- I do that.
- ...that he acts on.

07:32.452 --> 07:34.584
I have a proclivity for
that sort of thing. It's true.

07:34.628 --> 07:36.325
This is Peter, by the way.

07:36.368 --> 07:37.935
- The man with the goatee.
- Hello.

07:37.979 --> 07:40.155
I'm Max.
Our waiters name is Javier,

07:40.198 --> 07:42.723
if that clears anything
up in the racial debate.

07:42.766 --> 07:44.725
- I'm Brooke.
- I'm Halley.

07:44.768 --> 07:47.292
Ah, Brooke and Halley,
those are beautiful names.

07:47.336 --> 07:50.948
Well you have
a beautiful turtleneck.

07:50.992 --> 07:54.474
You guys brothers?
You look alike.

07:54.517 --> 07:56.258
Are we brothers?

07:56.301 --> 07:58.565
We get that all the time.
Just wait till we stand up.

07:58.608 --> 08:01.916
I'm sorry, when you said
that you had a feeling about us

08:01.959 --> 08:05.702
- were you just saying that or were-- like casually?
- No, no, no.

08:05.746 --> 08:07.965
- Or were you saying that because you--
- Oh, no, no, no.

08:08.009 --> 08:10.577
I wasn't just saying that casually,
I promise. I had a very realistic

08:10.620 --> 08:13.362
vision of the four of us getting to know
each other on a very personal level.

08:13.405 --> 08:16.670
- All because of Javier.
- Well that, and the fact that, you know,

08:16.713 --> 08:19.324
out of all
the places in New York,

08:19.368 --> 08:22.676
of all the little Indian places, we are
sitting right across from each other.

08:22.719 --> 08:24.547
- We chose the one on the left, too.
- Right,

08:24.591 --> 08:27.463
so I think that says
something in and of itself.

08:27.507 --> 08:28.551
He's never wrong.

08:30.597 --> 08:33.469
- You're asking me to define chemistry.
- Please.

08:33.513 --> 08:36.645
He was attractive to me
because he was so odd sexually.

08:36.690 --> 08:39.562
I mean, but you
wake up and you realize

08:39.606 --> 08:43.392
you don't know whose putting a butt plug
in your butt hole and that's scary, so.

08:43.434 --> 08:46.351
And I get that.
Did you know that there's a difference

08:46.395 --> 08:48.615
between butt plugs
and anal plugs?

08:48.658 --> 08:50.573
Really? No, I didn't know that.

08:50.617 --> 08:53.271
Butt plugs are for pleasure,
anal plugs are for incontinence.

08:54.316 --> 08:57.493
- And incontinence is when--
- Incontinence is when you shit yourself.

08:57.537 --> 08:58.407
Right.

08:59.974 --> 09:04.369
So, do you-- how long have you
been with your girlfriend?

09:04.413 --> 09:06.937
Um, we're coming
up on four years now.

09:06.981 --> 09:08.983
Wow, you live together?

09:09.026 --> 09:10.419
You want to sit?

09:10.462 --> 09:12.073
- Yeah.
- We're gonna sit.

09:12.116 --> 09:13.465
- You do that.
- All right.

09:15.467 --> 09:18.383
Uh, do we live together? No.

09:18.427 --> 09:22.213
It's kind of a long story. I live in
San Francisco, she lives in Montreal.

09:22.257 --> 09:23.780
Oh, I love Montreal.

09:25.216 --> 09:26.435
So where did you meet.

09:26.478 --> 09:27.741
At Stanford.

09:27.784 --> 09:29.743
Yeah, at a bar.

09:29.786 --> 09:31.092
Was it love at first sight?

09:33.137 --> 09:35.487
For me.
She took a little convincing.

09:37.838 --> 09:40.449
- Sounds romantic.
- It's not.

09:41.319 --> 09:43.626
So, you and Peter have
been friends your whole life?

09:43.670 --> 09:46.890
- Yeah. Yeah.
- That's very sweet. You guys must really love each other?

09:46.934 --> 09:49.501
Yeah we do.
He's a hell of a guy, you know.

09:49.545 --> 09:52.766
- My moral compass.
- What does that mean?

09:52.809 --> 09:56.683
Well, he has stability in his
life in contrast to me, I guess.

09:56.726 --> 10:00.600
You know, he has a long-term
relationship, he goes to school,

10:00.643 --> 10:03.777
he shaves every morning.
You know. You know, stability.

10:03.820 --> 10:05.561
I guess I find
that very admirable.

10:05.605 --> 10:07.911
Does that mean you
don't have a lot of stability?

10:07.955 --> 10:10.522
- Well, I have a theory, okay?
- Okay.

10:10.566 --> 10:14.614
And my theory is that all those things
in your life, relationships, work,

10:15.702 --> 10:18.966
everything, it should
make you feel good, you know.

10:19.009 --> 10:22.883
- Man, you're not one of those guys, are you?
- One of what guys?

10:22.926 --> 10:28.192
One of those guys that thinks that
selfishness is some kind of a virtue.

10:28.236 --> 10:30.238
Well, is that a bad thing?

10:30.281 --> 10:32.675
I mean you're free to live
your life however you want,

10:32.719 --> 10:36.374
but it can take quite a toll on
the people around you, you know.

10:36.418 --> 10:39.290
All right.
Well, when you put it that way.

10:41.902 --> 10:44.078
- What's wrong?
- Oh, no. Nothing. My, uh,

10:45.035 --> 10:47.995
I get very passionate when I talk
about these things. My neck cramps.

10:48.038 --> 10:49.953
Oh, do you want one?

10:49.997 --> 10:51.302
No. I don't smoke.

10:51.346 --> 10:53.000
That's your second cigarette.

10:53.043 --> 10:54.262
- I know.
- You have an addiction.

10:54.305 --> 10:56.873
Mm, I know.

10:58.179 --> 10:59.833
It's disgusting.

10:59.876 --> 11:01.922
Should I-- Is it unattractive?
Should I quit?

11:01.965 --> 11:03.924
It's not-- No.
It's not unattractive.

11:03.967 --> 11:07.362
Don't--
It's just a terrible habit.

11:07.405 --> 11:09.669
- Right. No, I feel like an idiot. I'll...
- Don't-- Just--

11:09.712 --> 11:11.845
- You know, I'll put it out.
- Wait, wait, wait.

11:11.888 --> 11:14.238
Don't do this. Don't-- Don't put it out.
What are you do-- Don't--

11:14.282 --> 11:16.850
I'm not-- I'm just-- I'm a guy you
just met in an Indian restaurant.

11:16.893 --> 11:18.721
You don't have to do anything
that I tell you to do.

11:18.765 --> 11:20.854
- It's fine. Smoke it. I just--
- Sorry.

11:22.856 --> 11:25.597
Don't apologize to me.
Why are you apologizing?

11:25.641 --> 11:27.643
I'm not your father.

11:27.687 --> 11:30.385
You're-- You're a strong
confident woman, obviously.

11:30.428 --> 11:32.604
That's-- It's not a--

11:33.910 --> 11:36.913
- I don't want it.
- Smoke your cigarette. Inhale that thing, you know.

11:36.957 --> 11:39.176
I don't want it.
I don't want it.

11:42.658 --> 11:44.312
Did you say
you were from here or...

11:44.355 --> 11:47.750
Yeah. Originally, I, uh,
yeah, live here and then--

11:47.794 --> 11:49.883
I was living in L.A.
for about five years and

11:49.926 --> 11:54.322
I just moved back and Halley's
lease was up so she moved in.

11:54.365 --> 11:56.541
So what made you go out there?

11:57.934 --> 12:01.416
- A boy and, uh, it didn't really work out.
- Right. Of course.

12:01.459 --> 12:04.332
And I was sort--
too stubborn to move back.

12:05.637 --> 12:06.726
Until now.

12:10.860 --> 12:14.385
Hm. It's funny.

12:14.429 --> 12:16.779
- What?
- Nothing.

12:16.823 --> 12:18.738
You guys are making me
feel so awkward.

12:18.781 --> 12:21.697
How do you-- How do you know
that I enjoy oral sex so much?

12:21.741 --> 12:24.744
Because you have
an oral affectation.

12:25.832 --> 12:27.659
That makes no sense.

12:27.703 --> 12:30.010
Well, Peter is a sex therapist.
So he's a--

12:30.053 --> 12:32.795
- He's a master on this matter. -Really? You are?
- Yeah. I know.

12:32.839 --> 12:34.884
- I wouldn't peg you as the type.
- This is our spot.

12:34.928 --> 12:37.191
- Oh, is it? -Yeah.
- Right here?

12:37.234 --> 12:39.671
-Yeah.
-Wow. It's beautiful.
-Thank you.

12:39.715 --> 12:41.499
Look at this.
It's like a mini fortress.

12:41.543 --> 12:43.327
Well, I-- This was so nice.

12:43.371 --> 12:46.243
I would-- I'm so happy
that we were able to do this.

12:46.287 --> 12:49.638
I got an idea. Would you guys like
to accompany us tonight to a bar?

12:49.681 --> 12:51.814
I'm organizing
a little get-together.

12:51.858 --> 12:54.817
- It's a little bit of an occasion.
- Yeah, it is. It's his birthday.

12:54.861 --> 12:57.211
-Today is your birthday?
-Really? Happy birthday.
-Thank you.

12:57.254 --> 12:59.822
- So, it's a big occasion. He's being modest.
- But don't let that affect

12:59.866 --> 13:02.346
your decision. If you have other plans,
go with that. I don't wanna pressure you.

13:02.390 --> 13:04.696
No. I don't
have any other plans.

13:04.740 --> 13:06.960
- Do you have other plans?
- Um, no. No. No. No. No.

13:07.003 --> 13:09.397
- Yeah. We'll go. We'd love to.
- Yeah. Okay.

13:09.440 --> 13:11.225
- Aw, that's great.
- Good.

13:11.268 --> 13:14.010
That's great news. Should
I just, uh, come back and, uh,

13:14.054 --> 13:16.839
knock on the door and shimmy
through the window.

13:16.883 --> 13:21.539
I'll give you my number. I don't, uh, have
my phone with me but I, I got one of these.

13:21.583 --> 13:24.368
Peter, I am sorry
if I offended you earlier.

13:24.412 --> 13:27.763
- Do you think we can move past this?
- Stop. You didn't offend me.

13:28.808 --> 13:30.679
- Mm-hm.
- I already told you it's not a big deal.

13:30.722 --> 13:33.073
- So, yes, we're fine.
- Okay.

13:33.116 --> 13:35.815
Or you could make
it up to me in bed.

13:35.858 --> 13:38.818
- Here, it's-- So just text me later and let us know the deal.
- I'm sorry?

13:38.861 --> 13:41.255
- Yeah. So old-fashioned.
- All right, guys.

13:41.298 --> 13:43.735
- Well, it was nice to meet you.
- It was nice to see you.

13:43.779 --> 13:45.346
- See you later.
- Later. Sure. Please, go.

13:45.389 --> 13:47.000
- Don't get in trouble.
- Thank you.

13:47.043 --> 13:48.958
- We'll try not to.
- Bye, Peter.

13:49.002 --> 13:51.395
-Yeah, all right. Bye.
-Get ready.
-Bye-bye now.

13:51.439 --> 13:53.702
You're tremendous.

13:53.745 --> 13:56.879
What-What did Halley say
that offended you?

13:56.923 --> 14:00.665
She said she doesn't care that I have
a girlfriend because I'm so attractive.

14:00.709 --> 14:03.190
- What?
- She was-- I wouldn't know how to reply to that.

14:03.233 --> 14:06.454
- What does she mean by that?
- Probably didn't know what a loyal guy you are.

14:06.497 --> 14:08.238
She's just giving you
a compliment, okay.

14:08.282 --> 14:10.501
She was trying to make me
cheat on my girlfriend.

14:10.545 --> 14:12.329
The whole time
she was trying to make me.

14:12.373 --> 14:14.810
Well, she was just--
She's a sophisticated girl.

14:14.854 --> 14:18.683
- She's putting herself out there in a way--
- I know that I overreacted. I--

14:18.727 --> 14:21.599
You did overreact a little bit. But, you
know, you have quite a little temper on you.

14:21.643 --> 14:24.472
- I don't like to yell on the street. But I'm sorry.
- You yelled at her?

14:24.515 --> 14:28.911
- I'm-- Yeah, of course, I yelled at her. She's...
- I think you're taking--

14:28.955 --> 14:31.435
I'm just going to manage my emotions a
little. I'm not in the mood right now.

14:31.479 --> 14:33.655
- I know you're tired.
- I'm not some sort of scumbag.

14:33.698 --> 14:35.700
It just made me really mad
when she said that.

14:35.744 --> 14:37.877
You have quite a little
temper on you sometimes.

14:37.920 --> 14:40.270
- I think you may be bipolar.
- Yeah, I know it's possible.

14:40.314 --> 14:43.230
- You know, my sister's in a mental hospital right now.
- What? Why?

14:43.273 --> 14:46.320
- Oh, I gotta refill my card.
- 'Cause she went fucking crazy.

14:46.363 --> 14:48.713
- When did this happen?
- About a month ago.

14:49.627 --> 14:51.020
What do you mean she went crazy?

14:51.064 --> 14:52.500
I mean that's what happened.

14:52.543 --> 14:54.632
I-- We have a history
of schizophrenia

14:54.676 --> 14:56.330
in the family
on my mother's side.

14:56.373 --> 14:58.375
And she just checked herself in?

14:58.419 --> 15:00.508
No. Actually,
the landlord found her going

15:00.551 --> 15:03.163
door-to-door naked
asking for swimsuits.

15:03.206 --> 15:05.643
Walked her back to her apartment
and found out she, uh,

15:05.687 --> 15:08.951
she flooded the place trying
to turn it into a swimming pool.

15:08.995 --> 15:11.345
With the city's facilities,
who can blame her, right?

15:11.388 --> 15:14.087
- Sure.
- I hate these fucking machines.

15:14.130 --> 15:17.090
- Do you mind getting me? It won't take my card.
- No, of course.

15:18.743 --> 15:21.964
Oh. Hey. Hey. Mine's dead too.

15:22.008 --> 15:24.967
Now, now we're talking.

15:25.011 --> 15:27.622
- Gotta remember to refill these things.
- Now we're talking.

15:27.665 --> 15:31.191
Imagine you just turned 23 and you go crazy.
You can't do anything about it either.

15:31.234 --> 15:33.367
You're in battle with
your own genetic structure.

15:33.410 --> 15:36.239
You just turn a certain age
and poof, you're gone.

15:36.283 --> 15:39.460
Like, what's to stop me from ending
up like Jack, or you like your sister?

15:39.503 --> 15:42.637
Well, Jack was suffering from depression.
You'd know if you were depressed.

15:42.680 --> 15:45.683
- Would I?
- My sister just started hearing voices saying,

15:45.727 --> 15:48.991
"Fill this place up with water. That
you gotta put some water in this place.

15:49.035 --> 15:52.212
Make it a pool." That, that's the thing
that you can't-- you can't expect.

15:52.255 --> 15:54.649
- Exactly. That's what scares me.
- But it's--

15:54.692 --> 15:57.521
- It's not-- But you can't be scared of that.
- I'm so scared. I'm very scared.

15:57.565 --> 16:00.350
I think as a kid, I was always
aware that getting older would

16:00.394 --> 16:02.744
mean knowing things about humans
that I would be scared of.

16:02.787 --> 16:05.573
And what is happening to me now
and what I believe I'm realizing

16:05.616 --> 16:07.923
is what is fundamentally
wrong with the world.

16:07.967 --> 16:11.187
And I'm scared now because I can't
imagine how I would become like that.

16:11.231 --> 16:14.234
- But I think you ought to be less pessimistic.
- Oh, I'm not pessimistic.

16:14.277 --> 16:16.236
No. No. No. No. I'm very--
I'm-I'm very realistic.

16:16.279 --> 16:18.368
- If you could take a step back.
- That's what I am.

16:18.412 --> 16:20.414
If you're gonna finger point
and call me names,

16:20.457 --> 16:22.807
call me realistic
because I can form an analogy

16:22.851 --> 16:26.072
based on any little neurotic or any
synchronic problem I have in my life

16:26.115 --> 16:28.552
compared to the human
condition since humans existed.

16:28.596 --> 16:31.338
That's why you feel
so important because it is.

16:31.381 --> 16:33.862
- It's important.
- Don't hit me, you fucking idiot.

16:34.994 --> 16:37.648
- Fucking--
- Come here.

16:39.085 --> 16:41.435
Okay. Stop.

16:43.959 --> 16:47.615
I was once completely convinced
that some sort of god existed.

16:47.658 --> 16:50.574
I thought people could choose to believe
anything they like as long as it made them feel

16:50.618 --> 16:53.621
better about themselves. But nobody
takes time to form their opinions

16:53.664 --> 16:57.277
based on what they feel is right, only
what other people will have them believe.

16:57.320 --> 16:58.321
Does that makes sense?

16:59.714 --> 17:02.499
Uh, yeah I've lost you.

17:02.543 --> 17:05.241
But if you feel good about it,
that's what's important.

17:07.113 --> 17:08.201
You're right.

17:09.810 --> 17:12.074
A little more off the
sides right here.

17:13.205 --> 17:15.077
Uh, Vanessa, it's me.

17:15.121 --> 17:17.079
I'm trying you again.

17:17.123 --> 17:19.603
Please, call me back. Bye.

17:20.909 --> 17:22.911
- What? 
- So there's a possibility Vanessa

17:22.954 --> 17:25.087
- and I are breaking up, actually.
- Finally.

17:25.131 --> 17:27.829
- Her and I have issues.
- Yeah. She doesn't like you.

17:27.872 --> 17:29.874
How long have you guys
been together again?

17:29.918 --> 17:32.703
- About four years.
- Four years. And in those four years,

17:32.747 --> 17:36.055
how much time have you actually
physically spent in each other's company?

17:36.098 --> 17:39.493
About a year. I mean we live
together but I-- About a year.

17:39.536 --> 17:41.147
So I rest my case.

17:41.190 --> 17:42.974
Where are we going, by the way?

17:43.018 --> 17:45.151
Jack wanted me to come here.
It was in his letter.

17:46.761 --> 17:50.112
Wait. I, I'm sorry.
Do you want me to come to this?

17:50.156 --> 17:54.812
- I can go to my sessions. I--
- You have a sessions while you're here?

17:54.856 --> 17:56.988
I have a session-- I've--
That's part of why I came

17:57.032 --> 17:59.165
is I have real sessions
to sit in on.

17:59.208 --> 18:01.819
- Oh.
- I told you that. Didn't I tell you that?

18:02.777 --> 18:05.519
Maybe. I don't know. No. Come.

18:05.562 --> 18:09.349
The back of the letter said, "P.S.
Tell Peter I would love it if he came."

18:09.392 --> 18:10.872
Oh, did he really write that?

18:23.058 --> 18:25.060
What are we
supposed to do here?

18:25.930 --> 18:27.976
- I don't know, really.
- It's beautiful.

18:29.108 --> 18:30.109
Yeah.

18:31.327 --> 18:33.199
Why did he tell you
to come here?

18:38.160 --> 18:41.468
Ever since I was nine, we
would come here on my birthday.

18:41.511 --> 18:42.860
This was our spot.

18:45.776 --> 18:47.126
That makes sense then.

18:53.741 --> 18:57.658
Yeah.

18:58.789 --> 18:59.877
I get it.

19:01.792 --> 19:03.359
He's saying take in the city.

19:04.273 --> 19:07.189
He's saying take in life,
take in the birds,

19:07.233 --> 19:08.799
the sounds,
the ice-skaters, the people.

19:08.843 --> 19:09.800
That's enough.

19:13.804 --> 19:14.979
I get it.

19:16.807 --> 19:19.158
- Excuse me. Can you take our picture?
- No, thanks.

19:21.247 --> 19:22.596
Fucking tourist.

19:23.684 --> 19:26.165
Jack's just wanting you to
feel through this thing.

19:26.208 --> 19:30.256
- So, don't be scared of that.
- Why would I be scared of that?

19:30.299 --> 19:34.173
Because it's
easier to feel nothing

19:34.216 --> 19:36.697
than it is
to feel vulnerable and--

19:36.740 --> 19:38.612
Can you stop acting
like my therapist?

19:38.655 --> 19:40.875
I know what I'm talking about
so I'm trying to help you.

19:40.918 --> 19:42.311
- This is the only way
I know how.

19:42.355 --> 19:44.444
- You can be a little overbearing
sometimes.

19:44.487 --> 19:46.185
Okay.
Okay. I'm sorry.

19:46.228 --> 19:48.230
I can't believe I'm 25.

19:48.274 --> 19:51.451
Isn't that weird? This just
gonna keep happening to me?

19:51.494 --> 19:55.455
- I get older but I feel the same exact way from when I was a kid?
- You're so different, though.

19:56.499 --> 19:58.327
You've gotten taller.

20:01.112 --> 20:03.506
Last time I saw Jack
we got in a big fight.

20:03.550 --> 20:05.421
Really? About what?

20:05.465 --> 20:08.642
He told me I should
go back to school and get a job.

20:08.685 --> 20:10.339
It might help.

20:10.383 --> 20:12.472
No.
What's that supposed to mean?

20:12.515 --> 20:14.952
All you do is drink
and smoke cigarettes.

20:14.996 --> 20:16.954
It's not true.
I write occasionally.

20:16.998 --> 20:19.479
Haven't sent me
anything in at least a year.

20:19.522 --> 20:22.264
- Yeah, I can't control my output.
- Well, I'm just, uh--

20:22.308 --> 20:26.181
I'm just telling you it might-- it might be
nice to actually do something once in a while.

20:26.225 --> 20:27.530
Oh, wow. Thanks, Jack.

20:28.401 --> 20:30.664
You can't even have
a real conversation about it.

20:32.318 --> 20:34.189
It, it's not
like I stopped going

20:34.233 --> 20:36.800
to school to become
some, some vagrant.

20:36.844 --> 20:39.194
I genuinely
am not made for school.

20:39.238 --> 20:42.066
And there's nothing wrong with me
having a drink every once in a while.

20:42.110 --> 20:44.547
- You said that a million times.
- Or doing whatever I'm doing. I have to be content

20:44.591 --> 20:48.682
- being discontent.
- I'm not saying stop, I'm saying do the moderation. That's all.

20:48.725 --> 20:53.034
- That I'm just-- I'm trying to become something that I'm not?
- Sort of seems like it.

20:53.077 --> 20:56.603
- You think I'm trying to become some aimless itinerant?
- This isn't-- This isn't you.

20:56.646 --> 20:59.083
- What do you mean this isn't me?
- Be yourself.

20:59.127 --> 21:03.000
I am. I'm being myself. I have to be
foolish and indulge myself when I can.

21:03.044 --> 21:05.699
- What does that even mean? -It's all we have, goddammit.
- What does that even mean?

21:05.742 --> 21:09.398
It means that I appreciate your
concern about how I'm living my life,

21:09.442 --> 21:12.183
but I have to do it the way I want,
not the way that you want. Okay?

21:12.227 --> 21:14.621
You sound like a child.
You sound like a little kid.

21:14.664 --> 21:17.450
- Jesus Christ.
- "I just wanna do what I wanna do."

21:17.493 --> 21:20.366
You don't condescend me in my fucking
lack of life experience, okay?

21:20.409 --> 21:23.325
- Easy does it. Alright? Just relax.
- Are you telling me--

21:23.369 --> 21:26.241
You know what? All you've done since
you've come here is act like a dick,

21:26.285 --> 21:30.332
and check your phone, Okay? I didn't ask
you to come to New York. If you wanna go

21:30.376 --> 21:33.248
- to Montreal to be with your girlfriend, then go do that.
- You didn't ask me to come here.

21:33.292 --> 21:36.425
- I came here to help you, that's what I've been trying to do.
- You're not helping.

21:36.469 --> 21:38.819
- And you just yell at me and you get defensive.
- You're not being any help.

21:38.862 --> 21:43.302
- And all I'm trying to do is talk to you.
- I'm getting defensive?

21:43.345 --> 21:45.478
- I should've gone to my session.
- There's children around that you're scaring.

21:45.521 --> 21:47.784
- Alright. I'm gonna go to my session.
- Yeah, go to your session.

21:47.828 --> 21:49.395
- Let's spend a little time apart. Okay?
- Yeah.

21:49.438 --> 21:50.918
Take a chill pill,
mister therapist man.

21:50.961 --> 21:52.136
Okay, I'll see
you when I see you.

21:52.180 --> 21:54.095
- I feel fine.
- Great.

21:54.138 --> 21:55.009
I feel fine.

22:28.042 --> 22:29.043
Hi, how are ya?

22:30.958 --> 22:32.699
Yeah, I heard you were in town.

22:35.615 --> 22:38.835
Um, I'm right
by Central Park right now.

22:41.838 --> 22:44.363
Yeah, sure, I could be there
in like 20 minutes.

22:46.887 --> 22:48.149
Okay, I'll see you then.

23:18.832 --> 23:19.876
I miss you.

23:22.923 --> 23:25.360
No, no, everything's okay honey.

23:27.449 --> 23:28.755
Yes.

23:28.798 --> 23:30.060
Oh, how's the baby?

23:30.104 --> 23:31.235
Good?

23:49.515 --> 23:50.646
You look terrible, pal.

24:00.874 --> 24:02.092
Wow.

24:06.488 --> 24:07.620
One hell of a view.

24:09.622 --> 24:12.929
The studio really didn't cheap you
out on the room this time around, huh?

24:18.457 --> 24:21.372
Should we order up
some room service? Get crazy?

24:23.897 --> 24:26.421
No, the idea of food
right now makes me wanna die.

24:30.425 --> 24:32.166
All right, well,
we don't have to then.

24:32.209 --> 24:34.168
I mean, you can. If you want.

24:39.434 --> 24:44.700
Hey, I'm so sorry about Jack.

24:46.615 --> 24:48.225
It's pretty hard to believe.

24:59.149 --> 25:00.411
How old was he?

25:02.457 --> 25:03.545
36.

25:06.113 --> 25:07.723
How's Maggie?

25:11.945 --> 25:13.555
I've been staying with her.

25:13.599 --> 25:14.948
That's good, right?

25:17.037 --> 25:20.562
Yeah, I don't know. I feel like everybody
just is realizing what a fuckup I am.

25:20.606 --> 25:22.085
You're not a fuckup, Max.

25:23.304 --> 25:25.219
Yeah, maybe I am though.

25:25.262 --> 25:27.047
I don't think so.

25:27.090 --> 25:29.179
I think you're just
figuring your shit out.

25:29.223 --> 25:31.573
Yeah, but I'd be kind of
figuring it out for a while now.

25:31.617 --> 25:33.836
Yeah. Well, you're the one
who said you can't put

25:33.880 --> 25:35.621
a timeframe on
those things, you know?

25:35.664 --> 25:37.884
Really? Hm, well...

25:39.320 --> 25:41.148
Recently I've sort of
realize that I didn't

25:41.191 --> 25:42.802
know what the fuck
I was talking about.

25:42.845 --> 25:44.020
Don't say that.

25:44.891 --> 25:45.848
It's true though.

25:47.110 --> 25:49.112
It's true.
I mean, look at-- look at Jack.

25:50.287 --> 25:52.725
The guy moved out to L.A.

25:52.768 --> 25:56.250
became a successful writer. I guess he
had it pretty fucking rolling, didn't he?

25:59.122 --> 26:01.081
You know, I used to
look up to him so much,

26:02.648 --> 26:06.739
but now I realize that he must
have been so unhappy for so long.

26:09.132 --> 26:12.527
By the way, it's, uh, really nice
of you to reach out on my birthday.

26:14.050 --> 26:15.486
It's not fair, Max.

26:17.314 --> 26:18.707
I don't call anyone.

26:18.751 --> 26:20.100
I don't talk to anyone.

26:21.231 --> 26:23.538
I'm just not
cut out for this shit.

26:23.582 --> 26:26.628
And I've been
having a really hard time.

26:26.672 --> 26:27.716
Yeah, so am I.

26:29.936 --> 26:32.068
It's not an excuse to
shut me out of your life.

26:33.679 --> 26:35.681
Okay.

26:35.724 --> 26:37.683
Well, you haven't
called me either.

26:37.726 --> 26:39.685
Right. Okay.

26:39.728 --> 26:42.339
Like that-- Like, do you at least
get why I wouldn't call you?

26:42.383 --> 26:46.474
- Of course I do.
- I, I truly do not resent you or hold any kind of grudge

26:46.517 --> 26:48.389
or think of me--

26:48.432 --> 26:51.740
You know, think of myself
as a victim in any kind of way.

26:51.784 --> 26:53.655
It's actually very liberating
not being with you.

26:53.699 --> 26:55.614
I'm sure you feel
the exact same way.

26:55.657 --> 26:58.399
You said that you hate
how all this made you feel.

26:59.835 --> 27:02.795
- How what made me feel?
- Being in a relationship.

27:02.838 --> 27:04.057
Especially with me.

27:06.320 --> 27:09.671
No, that's not quite true at all. Actually, I
would have been with you to the day I died.

27:09.715 --> 27:12.979
- I'm here right now, aren't I?
- Max, if I thought I was going to refer to you as

27:13.022 --> 27:16.330
an ex-boyfriend, I would never have
included you in my life to begin with.

27:16.373 --> 27:20.029
- Of course, you wouldn't. That-- That doesn't make sense.
- What doesn't make sense?

27:20.073 --> 27:24.686
Listen. You have to accept responsibility
for the fact that you fucked up.

27:24.730 --> 27:28.516
- I fucked up?
- Yeah, you fucked up. Okay? I did too, I admit it.

27:28.559 --> 27:31.345
But I feel like all you're trying
to do is justify what you're doing.

27:31.388 --> 27:34.609
I'm sorry I haven't called.
Max, I'm so sorry.

27:34.653 --> 27:36.785
Especially in the past month.

27:36.829 --> 27:39.222
Have you any idea how hard
it is to pick up the phone

27:39.266 --> 27:41.964
and call somebody when you know
they're really angry with you?

27:42.008 --> 27:44.010
- I'm not fucking angry at you.
- Yes, you are.

27:44.053 --> 27:45.272
Not because of that.

27:46.273 --> 27:47.883
What happened, happened.

27:47.927 --> 27:50.451
That's fine.
I don't blame you, okay?

27:51.539 --> 27:53.323
I don't blame you.

27:53.367 --> 27:56.283
I have lost a modicum of
compassion for you though,

27:56.326 --> 27:58.938
but I feel like that's
very rightfully earned.

27:58.981 --> 28:01.810
And that's legitimate, that's
not just my emotions talking.

28:04.334 --> 28:06.859
I'm really sorry
you feel that way.

28:06.902 --> 28:09.252
Okay, but you know how--
How can you just

28:09.296 --> 28:12.212
sit there and say, "I'm sorry you
feel that way." Like that, that just

28:12.255 --> 28:16.085
makes me think that the whole time
we were together was a fucking lie.

28:16.129 --> 28:18.740
And you can't sit there and act
like you don't love me anymore,

28:18.784 --> 28:22.004
because you know what? I know you do.
- Max, it got really hard.

28:23.440 --> 28:25.399
I'm always gonna love you.

28:25.442 --> 28:28.010
You're the love
of my fucking life.

28:28.054 --> 28:31.144
I'm never gonna give to
anybody what I gave to you.

28:31.187 --> 28:32.406
That's ours.

28:33.407 --> 28:34.713
- Is it?
- Yeah.

28:40.806 --> 28:43.983
- Then you should fucking act like it then, pal.
- Oh my god.

28:44.026 --> 28:46.812
I don't know what else
you want me to say.

28:46.855 --> 28:48.509
I don't know
how to make this better.

28:48.552 --> 28:51.686
I don't-- I mean--
What do you want from me?

28:51.730 --> 28:53.340
What do you want me
to say? I'm sorry?

28:53.383 --> 28:56.125
Max, I am so fucking sorry.

28:56.169 --> 28:58.911
I'm so sorry with every
single piece of me.

28:58.954 --> 29:01.783
- Stop. Stop, stop.
- I'm sorry. I can't do this.

29:04.743 --> 29:06.048
All right, come on.

29:06.092 --> 29:09.008
I, I can't.

29:09.051 --> 29:12.489
- Hey, look at me. Shh.
- I can't breathe.

29:15.928 --> 29:18.669
Come on, look at me.
You can breathe.

29:18.713 --> 29:24.850
- Shh.
- Fuck, it's your goddamned birthday today.

29:27.026 --> 29:30.594
- Happy birthday.
- Shh. Thank you.

29:35.643 --> 29:39.778
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
- Shh, shh.

29:39.821 --> 29:42.171
Shh, it's okay.

29:42.215 --> 29:43.259
I'm sorry.

30:12.941 --> 30:14.029
That was terrible.

30:15.161 --> 30:16.945
Yeah, probably a bad idea.

30:19.252 --> 30:20.819
Usually, I'm good for a couple.

30:21.950 --> 30:22.995
I know.

30:58.247 --> 31:01.076
Maggie. Hey.

31:01.120 --> 31:03.949
I know you're off work
and probably heading home

31:03.992 --> 31:06.734
but I was wondering if
I could see my sister?

31:08.083 --> 31:10.390
Yeah,
it's a bit of an emergency.

31:10.433 --> 31:14.916
- We had sex, kind of.
- Max, you didn't.

31:14.960 --> 31:17.832
- You haven't seen her since your break-up and you have sex?
- Hm.

31:17.876 --> 31:19.138
Well, that's kind of me.

31:20.704 --> 31:23.011
I'd rather not get into the
logistics of it here really.

31:23.055 --> 31:26.275
- I'll scare you.
- Well, are you okay? How do you feel about it?

31:26.319 --> 31:27.798
I don't know.

31:29.365 --> 31:31.541
I felt like we were
breaking up all over again.

31:33.935 --> 31:36.720
- It's like we were together, but not.
- It's a very common thing

31:36.764 --> 31:40.028
in relationships. Actually, it reminds
me of something from my therapy session,

31:40.072 --> 31:42.813
which I know you hate it when I talk
about my therapy, but it actually helps

31:42.857 --> 31:44.903
and you're gonna
like something Dr. Sillo said.

31:44.946 --> 31:47.818
- I doubt that.
- Just listen. It's this word, this French word,

31:47.862 --> 31:50.865
rapprochement, speaking
in relationship terms,

31:51.953 --> 31:54.042
you break up and then
at some point or another,

31:54.086 --> 31:56.958
you become closer again
only to come further apart

31:57.002 --> 32:01.180
and you continue to do this until you're
okay and not coming closer anymore.

32:02.572 --> 32:05.097
Wow, it's a hell of a word.

32:05.140 --> 32:07.099
Let me write that down.
Excuse me.

32:08.187 --> 32:10.885
So, does this mean that you
and Richard have a pre-planned

32:10.929 --> 32:13.105
post breakup sex
coming in the near future?

32:14.149 --> 32:17.936
Okay. Uh, so, I was gonna
tell you this before

32:17.979 --> 32:21.374
but, I, uh,
didn't wanna tell you.

32:23.158 --> 32:24.203
Okay.

32:24.246 --> 32:25.552
Richard and I broke up.

32:25.595 --> 32:28.294
Broke up? Wow.

32:28.337 --> 32:30.992
Did he break up with you, or?

32:31.036 --> 32:33.081
No, I broke up with him.

32:33.125 --> 32:36.128
Oh, no I just assumed.

32:36.171 --> 32:38.086
So, why did
you break up with him?

32:38.130 --> 32:40.610
Because I fell in love
with someone else.

32:40.654 --> 32:41.568
Look at you.

32:41.611 --> 32:42.961
Who's the guy?

32:43.004 --> 32:44.005
You don't know him.

32:44.049 --> 32:45.006
His name is Vinny.

32:45.050 --> 32:47.008
Vinny. Wow.

32:47.052 --> 32:49.576
- Shut up or I will kill you.
- Sorry, go on.

32:49.619 --> 32:50.881
Where did you guys meet?

32:52.579 --> 32:54.842
Okay, here it goes. Uh, so,

32:54.885 --> 32:58.324
- do you remember when my friend Luke Westerman got arrested?
- Vaguely.

32:58.367 --> 33:00.804
Well, I went to visit him
a couple of times

33:00.848 --> 33:02.502
and that's where I met Vinny.

33:03.503 --> 33:07.724
- Where, at prison?
- Yes.

33:07.768 --> 33:10.858
Was he just visiting
or was he a guard?

33:10.901 --> 33:11.772
Neither.

33:14.079 --> 33:15.210
He wasn't an inmate?

33:16.690 --> 33:19.040
- Yes.
- Hold on. Hold on.

33:19.084 --> 33:21.042
- I'm gonna stop you right there.
- Max, just don't freak out.

33:21.086 --> 33:23.044
- Just hold on a goddamn sec.
- Max, please stop freaking out.

33:23.088 --> 33:24.480
I'm not freaking out.

33:25.481 --> 33:27.309
- I'm freaking out a little bit.
- Oh, come on.

33:27.353 --> 33:30.834
Ok, no-- What did he do?

33:33.272 --> 33:36.492
- Well, he was really young and stupid and drunk.
- Sure. They all are.

33:36.536 --> 33:38.886
- See, I'm not telling you.
- No, no, no, I'm sorry.

33:38.929 --> 33:41.845
You're gonna tell me because you're
not gonna leave until you tell me.

33:41.889 --> 33:45.719
- So, just tell me now.
- He accidentally shot a woman.

33:45.762 --> 33:48.113
- He murdered someone?
- Technically it's manslaughter--

33:48.156 --> 33:51.377
What do you mean accidentally, what,
did he just slip and shoot his gun?

33:51.420 --> 33:53.509
And he served his time
and he's changed.

33:53.553 --> 33:56.034
Really, Max,
he's such a kind man.

33:58.210 --> 34:01.822
Oh, who are you? Who are you? I literally
don't know what to say right now.

34:01.865 --> 34:05.217
I've been sleeping on your couch for
the last three weeks and you just failed

34:05.260 --> 34:09.264
- to mention this?
- I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to tell you. It's just...

34:10.309 --> 34:13.442
- Sometimes you can be judgmental.
- Me? Judgmental?

34:13.485 --> 34:16.750
- I'm-- I'm not judgmental.
- You are, but it's fine.

34:16.793 --> 34:20.101
First of all, Richard and I were breaking
up anyway and neither of us had the balls

34:20.145 --> 34:23.757
to say it so it had to come to something
like this and secondly, Vinny is a gentle,

34:23.800 --> 34:27.369
sensitive man who actually
appreciates me and listens to me.

34:27.413 --> 34:29.980
- And you love him?
- Yes, I really do.

34:30.024 --> 34:32.722
Well, I'm sure conjugal visits have that
emotional effect on a lot of people.

34:32.766 --> 34:34.985
Stop. This is what I mean.

34:35.029 --> 34:37.858
I'm very vulnerable right now
and your sarcasm is not helping.

34:37.900 --> 34:40.556
I know. I'm sorry, that was
my last comment. I'm sorry.

34:40.600 --> 34:42.993
I know how this looks,
but I'm not going crazy.

34:43.036 --> 34:45.126
This is a crazy thing
to happen, but I actually

34:45.170 --> 34:48.608
- feel normal for the first time in so long.
- That's it then.

34:48.650 --> 34:51.697
You're doing what you feel is right.
So, you should. High five.

34:53.134 --> 34:57.356
And in a weird way, like, Jack dying made
it so clear to me how fucked up I was.

34:57.399 --> 34:59.619
It made me wanna get better.
Does that make sense?

35:00.924 --> 35:02.926
Yeah, yeah.

35:04.885 --> 35:05.973
Speak of the devil.

35:07.279 --> 35:09.107
Look what I got in the mail.

35:10.499 --> 35:11.761
Isn't that nice?

35:13.111 --> 35:15.765
This is why you're upset.

35:15.809 --> 35:18.638
Yeah, it's a little unsettling that our dead
brother's sending me letters in the mail.

35:18.681 --> 35:20.683
Yeah, I'm a little upset.
It's a little weird.

35:21.597 --> 35:26.733
He's just trying to
inspire you in his way, I think.

35:26.776 --> 35:29.823
You know, I just
feel like my whole

35:29.866 --> 35:34.567
life is like in a weird flux
at the moment.

35:34.610 --> 35:37.047
I feel like, I don't know.

35:37.091 --> 35:40.138
Did you ever feel like you worry
about things that aren't really there

35:40.181 --> 35:42.705
and you kinda just

35:42.749 --> 35:44.490
are in another dimension

35:44.533 --> 35:48.189
and you just feel
everything slipping away?

35:49.147 --> 35:52.280
It's a panic attack.
Welcome to my life.

35:53.499 --> 35:56.763
Which is also why I must go home
and take a nap immediately.

35:56.806 --> 36:00.070
I love you, I care for you,
I worry for you, but you will be fine.

36:00.114 --> 36:01.637
I'll see you tonight?

36:01.681 --> 36:02.812
Hey.

36:04.205 --> 36:05.250
You forgot something.

36:06.642 --> 36:07.774
Happy birthday.

36:09.558 --> 36:10.429
Thanks.

36:11.821 --> 36:13.519
- Be good, kid.
- You too.

37:04.265 --> 37:05.527
- Hi.
- Hi.

37:05.571 --> 37:06.702
- Oh, sorry.
- Oh, my god.

37:06.746 --> 37:08.487
My god, you scared me.

37:08.530 --> 37:10.140
Sorry.

37:11.490 --> 37:13.187
Sounded like a burglar.

37:15.233 --> 37:19.889
- Um, are you-- are you waiting?
- Uh, yeah, I mean, no, I was just waiting.

37:19.933 --> 37:23.110
I was, uh, in the neighborhood
and I just thought I'd stop by.

37:23.153 --> 37:24.546
Wow, I really scared you.

37:24.590 --> 37:25.895
- Yeah, you did.
- Sorry.

37:25.939 --> 37:26.809
Um.

37:28.246 --> 37:30.291
What, did you
just get some goodies?

37:30.335 --> 37:34.687
- Is-- Does Brooke know you're here, um?
- Um, no, she doesn't.

37:34.730 --> 37:38.604
I, I knocked a couple of times and
I rang the bell and I'm-- I texted-

37:38.647 --> 37:40.083
-but I didn't get an answer.

37:40.127 --> 37:41.911
So, I just figured I, I'd wait.

37:42.912 --> 37:47.308
- Um, do you-- Do you wanna come in?
- Oh, yeah.

37:47.352 --> 37:49.049
- Or, um.
- I mean, if that's all right.

37:49.092 --> 37:51.530
- I don't wanna intrude.
- No, I, um--

37:51.573 --> 37:53.923
I don't wanna catch
anybody with their pants down.

37:53.967 --> 37:55.621
Mm.

37:56.883 --> 37:58.319
Literally and metaphorically.

37:59.755 --> 38:00.626
Funny.

38:03.063 --> 38:04.847
That's a hell of
a lot of stairs.

38:05.805 --> 38:08.024
Yeah.

38:08.068 --> 38:11.245
Uh, do you--
Do you wanna come up?

38:11.289 --> 38:12.725
Sure.

38:16.946 --> 38:19.166
Architecture really
isn't what it used to be.

38:20.385 --> 38:21.995
- Yeah.
- How high does it go?

38:22.038 --> 38:24.998
Uh, to the top.

38:26.608 --> 38:28.131
Jesus Christ.

38:29.350 --> 38:31.483
This place is beautiful.
What an ambiance.

38:32.745 --> 38:34.616
I love it in here.

38:34.660 --> 38:37.924
You do? Oh, uh, thank you.

38:37.967 --> 38:44.365
- Max, where is Peter? Hrm.
- Peter's in therapy, listening to some middle-aged man

38:44.409 --> 38:48.978
- talk about how he likes to be the little spoon.
- Oh.

38:49.022 --> 38:51.633
Wow, you know this place just feels like

38:51.677 --> 38:53.940
it's been lived in
for a whole lifetime.

38:53.983 --> 38:56.203
Yeah, it's
Brooke's parents' house.

38:56.246 --> 39:00.207
- So, um--
- Oh, and are her parents alive or are they, you know?

39:00.250 --> 39:04.690
Uh, dead? No, uh, no they
just live somewhere else.

39:04.733 --> 39:06.692
Right, right.

39:07.693 --> 39:09.695
Well, very festive.

39:11.871 --> 39:13.438
And so what, what do you do?

39:13.481 --> 39:16.832
What's your, uh--
what's your vocation?

39:16.876 --> 39:19.705
Oh, uh, I'm a poet.

39:19.748 --> 39:21.663
Poet, really?

39:21.707 --> 39:24.797
Well, I mean, not really.

39:24.840 --> 39:30.498
Like I don't make money from poetry
because no one buys poetry. But, uh...

39:30.542 --> 39:32.413
- Right.
- Yeah, I, um...

39:33.501 --> 39:35.416
So, how do you
support yourself then?

39:35.460 --> 39:40.421
- So, I, I write articles freelance, um, yeah.
- Oh.

39:40.465 --> 39:42.728
And I do have other fun hobbies

39:42.771 --> 39:47.776
like antiquing and,
you know, drawing pictures.

39:47.820 --> 39:49.691
- Great.
- And stuff like that.

39:49.735 --> 39:51.867
And you really enjoy oral sex?

39:52.825 --> 39:54.348
Yes.

39:54.392 --> 39:55.654
Yes, I do.

39:55.697 --> 39:58.265
Hi, I'm in the bath.

39:59.571 --> 40:02.791
Uh, Brooke, Ma-- Max is here.

40:02.835 --> 40:04.793
What do you mean Max is here?

40:04.837 --> 40:06.447
- Hi, Brooke.
- Hi.

40:06.491 --> 40:08.841
I was just
in the neighborhood and

40:08.884 --> 40:13.541
thought I'd stop by a little
early and get this party started.

40:13.585 --> 40:16.414
Hey, Halley.
Can you in here for a second?

40:17.937 --> 40:22.507
Um, you, um, you can make
yourself at home or useful.

40:22.550 --> 40:24.770
Sure.
I'll put the groceries away.

40:26.511 --> 40:32.255
Um. Oh, and don-- Just this
chair, don't-- just don't sit on it.

40:32.299 --> 40:34.344
- It's like a hundred years old.
- Got It.

40:51.710 --> 40:53.407
Hey, Brooke, where does
the granola go?

41:23.829 --> 41:28.442
Hm, it's the oldest thing
I've ever seen in my life.

41:42.238 --> 41:44.197
Oops.

41:45.807 --> 41:46.852
Fuck!

41:50.812 --> 41:51.987
Shit!

41:59.429 --> 42:00.822
Oh, fuck me.

42:08.700 --> 42:12.442
What can we do tonight? What's like a
quintessential New York thing to do?

42:12.486 --> 42:15.010
I've lived here my entire life
and never enjoyed it properly.

42:15.054 --> 42:17.186
You have to go
ice-skating in Central Park.

42:17.230 --> 42:18.971
- Right.
- I mean, I know it's sort of a cliché,

42:19.014 --> 42:20.886
but it really is
the most fun thing to do.

42:20.929 --> 42:22.888
Yeah, it's not exactly
the most original thing.

42:22.931 --> 42:25.368
Ha, ha, ha.
Well, what would you like to do?

42:25.412 --> 42:28.633
Well, I mean it's not really a great
thing to recommend for the three of us,

42:28.676 --> 42:30.635
but I enjoy going
to my grandparents' house

42:30.678 --> 42:34.290
and having coffee and cake
and listening to their stories.

42:34.334 --> 42:35.770
Thank you, I'm good.

42:35.814 --> 42:37.511
She petrifies me.

42:37.555 --> 42:41.210
You're like a complete,
a hopeless romantic, huh?

42:41.254 --> 42:43.256
I am a little bit. I am.

42:43.299 --> 42:45.650
-More so than I care to admit.
-So sweet.
-Pretty sweet.

42:45.693 --> 42:48.957
Oh, Halley, what about you? What's--
what are your favorite things to do?

42:49.001 --> 42:51.525
I like going to really fancy
hotels and getting really drunk.

42:51.569 --> 42:53.962
- That's not all that she likes to do there.
- Their drinks get you so drunk.

42:54.006 --> 42:57.052
Tha-- that-- that leads to
one or two things, huh?

42:57.096 --> 42:59.838
Speaking of which, how about
we, um, you know, put Peter in

42:59.881 --> 43:02.231
and start the tempestuous
section of our evening?

43:02.275 --> 43:05.365
Hm. Oh god.
What does tempestuous mean?

43:05.408 --> 43:09.282
Are you asking me as a challenge
or are you asking me honestly?

43:09.325 --> 43:14.243
- Uh, both.
- Are we going now?

43:14.287 --> 43:17.377
- You don't even know what it means, do you?
- Yeah, we are going now.

43:17.420 --> 43:20.423
- We are going.
- I got you. You just like to use big words to sound smart.

43:20.467 --> 43:23.296
- Brooke, are you gonna drink-- -I
got your number. No, you can have it.

43:23.339 --> 43:25.864
You're not even drinking
your drink. Such a waste.

43:25.907 --> 43:27.909
- Maybe I'm just too disparaged to indulge you.
- Huh.

43:35.003 --> 43:38.659
- There he is. Hey.
- Hey, hey.

43:38.703 --> 43:42.663
- Hey.
- We meet again.

43:42.707 --> 43:45.013
- Okay.
- with all this sex talk?

44:25.314 --> 44:30.624
- Okay!
- ♪ Happy birthday To you ♪

44:33.801 --> 44:36.412
Do you need to wish on that?
Cheers.

44:44.203 --> 44:45.247
- Let's get some ciders.
- Let's go.

44:50.383 --> 44:52.515
Hey, how you doing?

44:52.559 --> 44:55.344
Good guy, good guy.

44:55.388 --> 44:58.173
The weird thing is I'm
supposed to watch a couple have sex.

44:58.217 --> 45:01.133
That's the next thing I'm supposed to
do when I get back to San Francisco.

45:01.176 --> 45:03.744
Is that why you decided to take
the job in the first place?

45:03.788 --> 45:05.050
Yeah, that's why--
I mean kind of.

45:05.093 --> 45:06.747
- Thank you.
- Is that sick?

45:06.791 --> 45:08.880
Wait a sec. Wait a--
No, no, you can't pay.

45:08.923 --> 45:10.751
- Let me give you some money.
- Peter, it's fine.

45:10.795 --> 45:13.928
- No, I insist.
- Peter, I wanted to. It's fine.

45:13.972 --> 45:16.322
Please, just take
the money and say thank you.

45:18.106 --> 45:19.717
Yeah, here, just take it all.

45:21.370 --> 45:26.506
- Just-
- Halley, it's the least us gentlemen can do.

45:26.549 --> 45:27.812
So unnecessary.

45:28.813 --> 45:31.641
It's not like we're
sleeping together... yet.

45:33.513 --> 45:35.036
- I'm going to the bathroom.
- Whoa, whoa.

45:35.080 --> 45:36.690
- Why would she say that?
- Please.

45:36.734 --> 45:38.561
She was just--
She was just being funny.

45:38.605 --> 45:39.911
Did you tell her?

45:41.086 --> 45:43.262
- What's going on with--
- Did she-- -I told her.

45:43.305 --> 45:45.786
- Told her what?
- Is that a weird-- Was that not a weird thing?

45:45.830 --> 45:47.701
No, it was a weird thing
because you were

45:47.745 --> 45:49.921
forcing money on her
after she bought you a drink.

45:49.964 --> 45:52.445
Yes, extremely
rudely, I may add.

45:52.488 --> 45:55.361
- Rudely? I'm trying to be nice.
- Like inappropriately nice.

45:55.404 --> 45:58.407
- What, are you living in 1952?
- Okay, fine.

45:59.844 --> 46:02.411
I'm a dickhead. All right,
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

46:02.455 --> 46:04.805
Order more spicy ciders,
these are cold.

46:05.763 --> 46:07.068
Pissing me off.

46:09.331 --> 46:14.075
- Wow.
- That's such a weird choice for him to be a sex therapist.

46:14.119 --> 46:16.425
Well, he's a narcissist,
so what do you expect?

46:17.383 --> 46:19.689
Strange man. Very strange man.

46:19.733 --> 46:23.693
So, Max, tell me stuff.

46:24.869 --> 46:29.047
All right. Um, my brother
killed himself a month ago.

46:33.442 --> 46:35.053
I'm so sorry.

46:36.489 --> 46:41.799
Um, yeah. No, it's um,
it's okay.

46:41.842 --> 46:44.453
That was-that was the first time
I said it out loud so that's--

46:45.411 --> 46:48.893
And I know it's terrible, but I don't
want our night to be ruined by it.

46:50.459 --> 46:51.939
Yeah, no, of course not.

46:53.288 --> 46:55.682
Um, yeah.

46:57.162 --> 46:59.468
Yeah. Have you had anything
like that in your life?

46:59.512 --> 47:02.428
Um...

47:05.866 --> 47:08.608
I had someone that uh...

47:10.088 --> 47:13.526
that I was very
close to a long time ago

47:13.569 --> 47:19.314
and, I don't know.
It's a really difficult thing to

47:20.185 --> 47:23.536
know how to process, you know.
It's such a different kind of grief.

47:25.799 --> 47:27.757
How are you doing with it?

47:31.718 --> 47:36.941
You know, I'm fine. I just-- Sad
feelings are kind of like the weather.

47:38.290 --> 47:41.249
You know, sometimes they stick around
but they always seem to go away.

47:43.338 --> 47:45.253
Do you really feel
that way or is that just

47:45.297 --> 47:48.039
something you heard
and you wanted it to be true?

47:48.082 --> 47:53.261
So, Brooke,
let me ask you a question now.

47:53.305 --> 47:56.308
Would you consider
yourself a happy person?

47:57.439 --> 48:00.442
Me, happy?
Happy people are boring.

48:00.486 --> 48:04.794
But, you know,
I had days like today

48:04.838 --> 48:11.018
and meeting you,
that's happiness, my friend.

48:12.715 --> 48:15.153
All the rest of the days
you're just trying

48:15.196 --> 48:17.764
to feel comfortable
in your own skin, you know.

48:18.678 --> 48:20.462
That's tagline from a novel.

48:20.506 --> 48:23.509
- What's your novel about?
- Oh, no, I don't have a novel.

48:23.552 --> 48:26.207
I was-I was speaking my
nonexistent, eventual novel.

48:26.251 --> 48:30.951
So, um,
what else have you written?

48:30.995 --> 48:31.909
Nothing.

48:33.214 --> 48:35.303
Nothing that's--
Nothing that's published, um.

48:39.829 --> 48:41.788
Well, you know you have to
write to be a writer.

48:41.831 --> 48:43.529
You realize that, right?

48:43.572 --> 48:45.879
My brother
was actually a writer.

48:45.923 --> 48:48.360
He was, he was, he was good.

48:48.403 --> 48:49.448
He was really good.

48:51.015 --> 48:52.930
Have you thought
about writing about him?

48:54.975 --> 48:55.976
Not really.

48:56.934 --> 48:58.326
- Why not?
- Uh...

49:00.024 --> 49:03.853
I feel like I, um, I-- I-- No.

49:03.897 --> 49:05.072
I think I would be--

49:06.944 --> 49:09.163
I think I would be too afraid of
what would come out to be honest.

49:10.643 --> 49:13.254
Don't tell anybody that.
Especially Peter.

49:13.298 --> 49:15.256
- That's a little embarrassing.
- No, I would never.

49:15.300 --> 49:16.823
Do you actually--
Would you like to

49:16.866 --> 49:19.391
hear a little secret
regarding Peter?

49:19.434 --> 49:21.610
I love secrets. Yes.

49:21.654 --> 49:23.961
Uhm, should we order
another drink first?

49:24.004 --> 49:25.875
We should always order
another drink first.

49:25.919 --> 49:29.401
So, I went to go
visit Peter at college

49:29.444 --> 49:31.838
before him and his girlfriend
Vanessa started dating.

49:31.881 --> 49:37.365
But, unbeknownst to Peter,
Vanessa and I actually kissed first.

49:37.409 --> 49:39.977
What?
You guys liked each other first?

49:40.020 --> 49:42.283
Well, we didn't really like
each other. We kind of just

49:42.327 --> 49:44.807
met and had a drunken moment
where we kissed,

49:44.851 --> 49:47.375
had a little tongue,
a little boob feel-up.

49:47.419 --> 49:49.682
But, it never advanced, but--

49:49.725 --> 49:52.119
- Did you go like this?
- No, no.

49:52.163 --> 49:54.948
- It wasn't over the shirt.
- Did I scare Peter off?

49:54.992 --> 49:57.429
- No, he just went to the bathroom.
- Wait, so Peter doesn't know?

49:57.472 --> 49:58.908
Peter doesn't know what?

50:00.910 --> 50:01.781
What?

50:06.046 --> 50:08.527
- I'm not angry. I'm not angry.
- Are you sure?

50:08.570 --> 50:10.137
- I think you're-
- Not at you, not at you.

50:10.181 --> 50:12.922
I don't know why she would not--

50:12.966 --> 50:15.403
I'm gonna make a call,
I'm gonna make a phone call.

50:15.447 --> 50:17.971
We should probably
head downtown pretty soon.

50:18.015 --> 50:19.929
You cheated on me, right?

50:19.973 --> 50:21.888
And, I said take some time
to figure it out

50:21.931 --> 50:24.064
and tell me how you feel,
I'm texting you all day,

50:24.108 --> 50:26.458
you don't text me back,
I call, you don't call me back

50:26.501 --> 50:29.504
and I have to call you to tell
you, I just found out that

50:29.548 --> 50:32.246
you, you kissed
my friend four years ago!

50:32.290 --> 50:34.205
You are a liar,
you are a bullshit artist.

50:34.248 --> 50:36.468
Leave him out of it--
Leave Max out of it.

50:36.511 --> 50:38.470
Yeah-- it might not
have been the best idea, Max.

50:38.513 --> 50:40.646
There could have been
a better time to tell him.

50:40.689 --> 50:42.778
It's better than
him not finding out, I mean,

50:42.822 --> 50:44.780
- you said honesty is the best policy.
- But not for everybody.

50:44.824 --> 50:46.913
Not everybody can
handle it, you know.

50:46.956 --> 50:49.481
Oh, oh, she is going to
talk in her little baby voice.

50:49.524 --> 50:52.962
No, no, don't speak
French to me, speak English.

50:53.006 --> 50:54.312
I feel bad.

50:54.355 --> 50:55.965
Don't feel bad.

50:56.009 --> 50:57.532
Do you think
they're breaking up?

50:57.576 --> 50:59.839
I highly doubt it.

51:04.800 --> 51:07.281
I wonder what he is saying.

51:07.325 --> 51:09.544
He just said "I want to rip off

51:09.588 --> 51:11.851
your vagina and throw
it into the ocean."

51:12.721 --> 51:14.332
I probably shouldn't
have said anything.

51:24.820 --> 51:26.083
Hey!

51:28.259 --> 51:30.913
- Hey.
- Happy birthday!

51:30.957 --> 51:34.134
- You've made it.
- Oh, my god.
-Hi, Pete.

51:34.178 --> 51:36.005
- It's been so long.
- I know.

51:36.049 --> 51:38.617
This is Vinny-- this is Vinny.

51:38.660 --> 51:41.359
- Hey, how are you doing, mate?
- Good, nice to meet you. -Here's my brother, Max.

51:41.402 --> 51:44.013
- Hey, Max, how are you, man?
- Heard a lot about you, man.

51:44.057 --> 51:48.801
I feel so good about it. I feel like I--
Like she was yielding this power over me,

51:48.844 --> 51:51.804
- this stupid bitch.
- Relationships are so hard,

51:51.847 --> 51:56.156
- you know, my ex-boyfriend--
- The guy-- yeah the guy-- the fucking butler guy, yeah.

51:56.200 --> 52:00.029
- You remember that, yeah.
- Yeah, it was five hours ago, of course I remember it.

52:00.073 --> 52:02.554
I mean
its awkward at first, but,

52:02.597 --> 52:04.947
it's just, I feel blessed
more than anything else.

52:04.991 --> 52:08.212
You've got a second chance, you
know, live a life, real life.

52:08.255 --> 52:10.518
- Right. -Not that other shit.
- So, how was it?

52:10.562 --> 52:12.825
- The joint?
- Yeah.

52:12.868 --> 52:15.393
I mean, listen, jail,
it's like camp after a while,

52:15.436 --> 52:18.178
you know, you either fit in or
you go the opposite direction.

52:18.222 --> 52:21.007
Me and myself I-- I educated.

52:21.050 --> 52:23.140
I mean I used the time
to gain some knowledge.

52:23.183 --> 52:24.576
-That's inspiring, man.
-Yeah.
-Fascinating.

52:24.619 --> 52:26.839
How old was
the woman that you killed

52:26.882 --> 52:30.147
- if you don't mind me...
- No, no, no, she was 63.

52:30.190 --> 52:32.584
- 63 years old. Yeah.
- Really?

52:32.627 --> 52:35.108
She was going anyway, you
probably did her a favor, right?

52:38.459 --> 52:42.028
- I'm drunk.
- Yeah, okay, there they are, couple of the night.

52:42.071 --> 52:44.944
They did it,
they took their sweet time.

52:46.119 --> 52:49.296
They probably fi-- I haven't
had sex in nine months.

52:49.340 --> 52:52.430
I haven't had sex
in nine months.

52:53.431 --> 52:55.824
I haven't had sex
in three weeks.

53:00.873 --> 53:02.918
Yeah, lick everywhere.

53:02.962 --> 53:05.834
- Sylvia.
- Yes, Mickey.

53:05.878 --> 53:08.185
How you call your lover boy?

53:08.228 --> 53:10.012
Come here, lover boy.

53:10.056 --> 53:11.275
And, if he doesn't answer?

53:11.318 --> 53:12.580
Oh, lover boy.

53:12.624 --> 53:14.582
And, if he still doesn't answer?

53:14.626 --> 53:19.239
I simply say ♪ Baby, oh baby

53:19.283 --> 53:24.244
This is so much fun, I haven't had this
much fun in honestly I don't know how long.

53:24.288 --> 53:29.162
- Max, do you think Peter's okay?
- Yes, it's just, Peter's okay. Listen, Peter needs this,

53:29.206 --> 53:30.772
you know it just
makes you realize

53:30.816 --> 53:33.732
how love is all
a mentality really,

53:33.775 --> 53:37.431
it's so physiological,
really is personality.

53:37.475 --> 53:38.824
I want to suck that cock.

53:40.304 --> 53:41.348
Uh-huh.

53:42.871 --> 53:44.786
What the fuck is taking so long?

53:44.830 --> 53:48.137
- Hurry.
- Alright, yeah. Fucking...

53:48.181 --> 53:49.095
Fucking do it.

53:53.317 --> 53:56.058
I'm so happy she's happy.

53:56.102 --> 53:58.496
Look at them,
they look like children.

53:58.539 --> 54:02.282
Mm-hm, in we could all look at the
world through the eyes of children,

54:02.326 --> 54:04.066
you know, I'd be
so much happier.

54:06.591 --> 54:09.376
You are amazing.

54:09.420 --> 54:11.726
- You are amazing.
- Why?

54:11.770 --> 54:15.034
Just, okay, so... I don't want you to
think that I'm some sort of pervert,

54:15.077 --> 54:17.819
I'm not, I don't hold
any ulterior motives

54:17.863 --> 54:20.082
- with what I'm about to say, okay?
- Mm-hm.

54:20.126 --> 54:25.392
But I think I can fall in
love with you very easily.

54:29.701 --> 54:31.746
I think you are
building me up in your head.

54:31.790 --> 54:33.357
No, I'm not.

54:35.272 --> 54:38.405
- You barely know me.
- I know you.

54:38.449 --> 54:40.320
I know you very well, truly.

54:40.364 --> 54:42.975
The first time I saw you,
I felt like I've known you

54:43.018 --> 54:45.151
my whole life and you
don't get that with people.

54:48.197 --> 54:50.852
What is it about me
that's so intriguing?

54:54.552 --> 54:56.205
You mean, you really don't know?

55:00.427 --> 55:04.344
I've been hurt a bunch, Max.
My idea of myself has really changed.

55:09.131 --> 55:12.831
You make me feel like everything is
going to be okay, even if it's not.

55:17.618 --> 55:18.880
Sweet.

55:24.451 --> 55:26.279
Get it, get it, get it.

55:33.068 --> 55:34.896
Fucking
licked your face off.

55:34.940 --> 55:38.596
Oh, yeah, look at that!
He's killing it.

55:38.639 --> 55:41.990
We did something bad,
we did a bad thing.

55:42.034 --> 55:43.252
What did you guys do?

55:43.296 --> 55:44.558
We did some drool pass.

55:44.602 --> 55:46.386
A little old game?

55:46.430 --> 55:48.388
- A little bit.
- A little old man.

55:48.432 --> 55:50.347
A little old man...

55:50.390 --> 55:53.393
- You wanna do some?
- Yeah, where did you get it?

55:53.437 --> 55:57.005
I've got a friend, Ho Seong Lee,
he runs this place.

55:57.049 --> 55:59.791
I want to be
his investing partner.

56:02.097 --> 56:04.883
- Uch. What is this?
- Uh-uh.

56:04.926 --> 56:06.972
Straight from Korea.

56:07.015 --> 56:09.061
Ouch, oh...

56:11.455 --> 56:14.283
- Maggie? Maggie?
- What the fuck? Richard, dude.

56:14.327 --> 56:16.677
- No, what--
- What are you doing? Dude?

56:16.721 --> 56:18.505
- Just let me talk to her.
- Why are you even here?

56:18.549 --> 56:19.854
I just-- Move the fuck out.

56:19.898 --> 56:24.293
- Richard!
- Who the fuck are you?

56:24.337 --> 56:27.340
Officer, please, he didn't start the
fight, he was just trying to protect himself

56:27.384 --> 56:30.212
- You don't understand, it was Richard's fault.
- It's OK, it's alright. Baby!

56:30.256 --> 56:33.781
Baby, it's okay, baby, it's okay.
Alright, we'll be good. It's okay.

56:33.825 --> 56:36.349
I'm ok. Don't worry, it's okay.

56:39.526 --> 56:42.529
- You'll be fine.
- It's OK.

56:44.531 --> 56:47.099
- You going to go talk to her?
- Yeah, for sure.

56:53.322 --> 56:56.108
Thanks a lot, fuck you.

56:56.151 --> 56:58.284
- Hey.
- Max, I'm not in the mood for your jokes, okay.

56:58.327 --> 57:00.634
No, no, no. I'm not joking.
I'm not gonna joke.

57:01.940 --> 57:05.422
- I don't know what to do.
- I know, I know, just breathe, okay?

57:05.465 --> 57:07.336
- My head feels like it's gonna explode.
- No, no, no,

57:07.380 --> 57:09.208
it's not gonna explode.
It's not gonna explode.

57:09.251 --> 57:11.863
Why don't we just go back
to my place, you can sleep there

57:11.906 --> 57:14.256
for the night, you wake up in the
morning, you figure out what to do.

57:14.300 --> 57:15.606
- Really bad taste.
- Okay?

57:15.649 --> 57:16.781
- Okay.
- You good?

57:16.824 --> 57:18.304
- So...
- Is she okay?

57:18.347 --> 57:20.349
Yeah, she's fine,
she's just upset.

57:20.393 --> 57:22.917
No, it's, it's--

57:22.961 --> 57:25.093
- How do you feel?
- Max?

57:25.137 --> 57:26.921
- Yeah.
- I'm gonna go to the police station

57:26.965 --> 57:28.706
and see if there's
anything I can do.

57:28.749 --> 57:30.185
Do you want me to come?

57:30.229 --> 57:31.622
No, it's your
birthday, you stay.

57:31.665 --> 57:32.971
- Are you sure?
- Promise.

57:33.014 --> 57:34.625
- I'll come.
- No, it's fine.

57:37.541 --> 57:38.977
Maggie!

57:39.020 --> 57:41.153
- Just give me a second.
- Hey.

57:41.196 --> 57:43.111
If you need me,
just call me, okay?

57:43.155 --> 57:44.156
I will.

57:45.897 --> 57:48.334
What's wrong with you?
You alright?

57:48.377 --> 57:50.989
I just so sorry,
I'm so embarrassed,

57:51.032 --> 57:54.514
- I'm such a bad sister, I ruined your birthday.
- No, you're not, you didn't ruin

57:54.558 --> 57:56.734
anything, fucking
get yourself together.

57:56.777 --> 58:00.520
Do I deserve this, Max?

58:00.564 --> 58:04.002
No, you don't deserve this,
you are a good person.

58:06.483 --> 58:13.794
I just miss Jack. I really,
really do. I wish he was here.

58:13.838 --> 58:16.971
I know. I know.
I do too. I do too.

58:19.931 --> 58:22.890
Hi, how are you guys,
you still here?

58:22.934 --> 58:24.631
Of course,

58:25.806 --> 58:27.373
You okay?

58:27.416 --> 58:29.288
I'm fine, where's Peter?

58:29.331 --> 58:30.594
He's in the bathroom.

58:32.160 --> 58:35.120
Well, I'll go get him and then
we can leave immediately.

58:35.163 --> 58:37.949
- I'm so sorry.
- Don't apologize.

58:37.992 --> 58:39.690
- I'll be right back.
- It's okay.

58:41.909 --> 58:43.041
I feel sick.

58:45.478 --> 58:46.697
Get out!

58:48.568 --> 58:52.093
Excuse me, I'm sorry,
I'm just gonna

58:52.137 --> 58:55.401
see if find my good friend
here, he's in there?

58:55.444 --> 58:57.882
Yeah, he's locked himself in
there, he's not even answering.

58:57.925 --> 59:00.885
Peter? Come on man, people are waiting.

59:00.928 --> 59:03.017
Yo, Peter?
How long has he been in there?

59:03.061 --> 59:06.630
- Too fucking long.
- Peter, its Max.

59:06.673 --> 59:08.240
I gotta piss so hard, man.

59:10.024 --> 59:11.330
Peter?

59:12.592 --> 59:14.551
Peter!

59:15.639 --> 59:19.599
Peter, hey man,
Hey! Come on, Peter.

59:19.643 --> 59:21.949
Peter! Peter, fuck!

59:21.993 --> 59:23.951
Peter, look at me! Peter?

59:23.995 --> 59:27.259
Peter! Peter. Hey, hey, hey!

59:27.302 --> 59:31.785
Look at me! Look at me!
Hey! Hey!

59:31.829 --> 59:35.963
Stay with me.
Stay with me! Stay! No, no, no.

59:36.007 --> 59:37.661
Peter, Peter!

59:37.704 --> 59:39.532
Call fucking 911!

59:40.620 --> 59:42.230
He's got to ride alone.

59:43.144 --> 59:46.931
We are going to
Downtown Hospital. Let's go.

01:00:01.032 --> 01:00:03.687
Are you okay?

01:00:03.730 --> 01:00:06.646
- I took the same stuff.
- Okay.

01:00:06.690 --> 01:00:09.083
No, 'cause he,
he took a lot more than us.

01:00:10.215 --> 01:00:11.390
You're okay.

01:00:16.874 --> 01:00:18.353
It's beating fast.

01:00:18.397 --> 01:00:20.225
You're okay

01:00:20.268 --> 01:00:21.661
I gotta get to the hospital.

01:00:23.445 --> 01:00:24.925
Walk us to
the subway first, okay.

01:00:27.362 --> 01:00:30.191
You're okay. Come here.

01:00:39.723 --> 01:00:40.941
Goodbye, Max.

01:00:42.595 --> 01:00:44.728
Can you tell Peter
I said goodbye, too?

01:00:48.383 --> 01:00:50.864
It was fun, Happy Birthday.

01:00:57.828 --> 01:00:58.785
How are you doing?

01:01:00.047 --> 01:01:02.789
My, my heart is
still beating really fast.

01:01:02.833 --> 01:01:06.227
You're okay. If you were dying,
you'd we dead already.

01:01:07.881 --> 01:01:09.187
That's assuring.

01:01:20.241 --> 01:01:21.852
You're not Peter.

01:01:24.028 --> 01:01:26.117
And you're not Jack.

01:01:32.558 --> 01:01:34.255
Goodbye, sweet Max.

01:02:28.353 --> 01:02:31.008
Hey there, birthday boy,
everything all right?

01:02:31.051 --> 01:02:33.445
Yeah, it's still
coming in waves a bit.

01:02:33.488 --> 01:02:35.534
Okay,
keep taking deep breaths, so,

01:02:35.577 --> 01:02:39.364
- once the palpitations stop, we can check you out.
- Okay.

01:02:39.407 --> 01:02:43.803
Well, by the way, the doctor just
released your friend a few minutes ago.

01:02:43.847 --> 01:02:46.197
- Did he?
- Yeah.

01:02:46.240 --> 01:02:49.548
- How is he?
- He still a little wobbly on his feet but

01:02:49.591 --> 01:02:53.204
- you just make sure you keep an eye on him, okay?
- Okay. All right.

01:02:54.771 --> 01:02:56.816
Oh, can I have some more juice?

01:02:56.860 --> 01:02:59.427
- Sure.
- Thank you.

01:03:09.829 --> 01:03:10.699
Here he is.

01:03:16.096 --> 01:03:19.447
Look at you,
looking like million bucks.

01:03:24.713 --> 01:03:26.193
What are you doing here?

01:03:28.500 --> 01:03:32.286
I thought I was having a small heart
attack, so I checked myself in.

01:03:32.330 --> 01:03:36.247
- Gotcha.
- What did the doctor say?

01:03:36.290 --> 01:03:40.860
He said uh, I have a...
I was dehydrated

01:03:40.904 --> 01:03:44.646
and tired something.
I wasn't listening.

01:03:48.433 --> 01:03:51.088
I'm sure all or some these
drugs played a small part.

01:03:53.003 --> 01:03:54.831
Guy's a real
piece of shit suddenly.

01:03:56.658 --> 01:03:58.443
Yeah, he really got you.

01:04:09.933 --> 01:04:11.456
Hey, pal, are you all right?

01:04:13.937 --> 01:04:16.678
Why did you say that to me?

01:04:16.722 --> 01:04:18.202
That you and Vanessa kissed.

01:04:20.726 --> 01:04:24.512
I was just--
Sure, okay, I was showing off.

01:04:24.556 --> 01:04:27.124
- I didn't mean for it to be any--
- Don't do that.

01:04:28.952 --> 01:04:30.344
Don't ever do that to me.

01:04:44.097 --> 01:04:45.316
I'm sorry.

01:04:48.232 --> 01:04:49.886
It's been a very trying day.

01:05:58.171 --> 01:05:59.390
Hey, can I have a cigarette?

01:06:21.716 --> 01:06:23.457
I should probably
catch this train.

01:06:26.199 --> 01:06:29.028
Montreal, do you have to?

01:06:33.598 --> 01:06:35.078
Yeah.

01:06:35.121 --> 01:06:36.122
I have to.

01:06:53.835 --> 01:06:54.793
Come on.

01:09:11.669 --> 01:09:14.323
So, what's up with
you and Vanessa now?

01:09:14.367 --> 01:09:15.238
I don't know.

01:09:17.109 --> 01:09:18.109
It's over.

01:09:19.807 --> 01:09:21.287
Over over?

01:09:21.331 --> 01:09:22.549
As in forever?

01:09:23.550 --> 01:09:24.595
Yeah.

01:09:25.551 --> 01:09:26.684
Jesus.

01:09:30.296 --> 01:09:32.603
I feel like
that might be my fault.

01:09:32.645 --> 01:09:34.430
It is, partially.

01:09:34.474 --> 01:09:38.174
But she wasn't happy,
I definitely wasn't happy.

01:09:39.305 --> 01:09:42.352
- You gotta do what makes you happy, right?
- Right.

01:09:45.572 --> 01:09:47.270
I feel like
I don't know how to do that.

01:09:48.444 --> 01:09:50.577
I don't think I do either.

01:09:50.621 --> 01:09:52.318
We'll figure it out, huh, pal?

01:09:54.277 --> 01:09:55.408
Is this you?

01:09:55.452 --> 01:09:56.757
Yeah, this is me.

01:10:01.893 --> 01:10:04.069
- I love you.
- Love you too, big guy.

01:10:04.112 --> 01:10:07.203
- Merry Christmas.
- Be safe.

01:10:07.246 --> 01:10:09.422
- This was wild.
- Thanks for coming out.

01:10:10.858 --> 01:10:12.947
- Hey, I'll call you from Canada.
- All right.

01:10:14.949 --> 01:10:17.082
- You're my guy.
- You're my guy.

01:10:25.960 --> 01:10:27.005
Hey, hey!

01:10:29.268 --> 01:10:30.791
I could stay for Christmas.

01:10:31.879 --> 01:10:32.793
What about Vanessa?

01:10:34.360 --> 01:10:36.449
I don't need to take a train
to know that we've broken up

01:10:36.493 --> 01:10:37.842
and that I don't love her.

01:10:38.973 --> 01:10:40.061
Are you sure?

01:10:47.243 --> 01:10:52.073
- Yeah.
- I mean, I'd love that.

01:10:52.117 --> 01:10:53.161
Me too.

01:10:54.554 --> 01:10:56.426
Okay.

01:10:56.469 --> 01:10:57.340
You're hungry?

01:10:58.819 --> 01:11:00.430
I could eat.

01:11:00.473 --> 01:11:02.910
You want to go to
the Indian place on the right?

01:11:02.954 --> 01:11:03.824
