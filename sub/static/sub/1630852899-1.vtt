WEBVTT

00:30.987 --> 00:33.598
Have to
get home.

00:33.729 --> 00:34.686
There's no time.
Come on.

00:39.778 --> 00:42.042
I almost
don't know.

00:42.172 --> 00:44.783
Okay. I mean, is
it just me or does it--

00:44.914 --> 00:46.829
Okay, folks.
We are closed for the night.

00:46.959 --> 00:50.659
It's time
to get home.

00:50.789 --> 00:52.661
-Good night.
-Thanks, Sara.

00:52.791 --> 00:55.272
Get home safe.

00:55.403 --> 00:56.795
-Night.
-Good night.

00:56.926 --> 00:57.970
-Thanks, Sara.
-Good night.

01:56.812 --> 01:59.031
Time to come in,
sweetie.

01:59.162 --> 02:01.512
Just five more
minutes, please?

02:01.643 --> 02:04.472
Meagan, listen
to your mom.

02:04.602 --> 02:05.908
Okay, Sheriff.

02:06.038 --> 02:07.170
Let's go.

02:08.389 --> 02:09.564
Good girl.

02:14.917 --> 02:17.137
-Night.
-Night, Sheriff.

02:27.625 --> 02:28.713
Hurry on home.

02:40.421 --> 02:41.161
Checkmate.

02:41.291 --> 02:42.553
Uh, yeah. You got me.

02:44.773 --> 02:47.428
You beat me, Dad.

02:47.558 --> 02:48.994
You're still
the best there is.

02:49.125 --> 02:50.387
Alright, Mr. Liu.

02:50.518 --> 02:52.346
Time to go downstairs
to the basement, okay?

02:52.476 --> 02:54.391
We-- We are playing!

02:54.522 --> 02:55.871
Hey. Hey.

02:56.001 --> 02:57.481
-It's okay.
-Sorry.

02:57.612 --> 02:59.831
It's okay. It's okay.

02:59.962 --> 03:01.659
Gina's gonna take
you down to the basement,

03:01.790 --> 03:03.574
and you can come back
up in the morning.

03:03.705 --> 03:05.272
Just like we talked
about, remember?

03:06.142 --> 03:08.666
You are good girl.

03:10.712 --> 03:11.713
Oh, look.
Gina's here.

03:11.843 --> 03:13.062
-Let's go.
-Let's go, Mr. Liu.

03:13.193 --> 03:15.847
Up we go.
There we go.

03:15.978 --> 03:17.588
Nice and
steady, right?

03:17.719 --> 03:19.503
-Oh, watch your step.
-Careful.

03:23.159 --> 03:26.554
Um, you, uh, you have a
really great way with him.

03:26.684 --> 03:28.120
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

03:28.251 --> 03:30.122
Um, you should tell your mom
she's more than welcome

03:30.253 --> 03:31.689
to spend the night
with him if she wants.

03:31.820 --> 03:33.125
Oh.

03:33.256 --> 03:35.519
She just keeps saying
that he'll get better.

03:35.650 --> 03:37.956
Denial is a major branch
of our family tree.

03:44.311 --> 03:48.053
Uh, I-- I guess I'll
see you tomorrow.

03:48.184 --> 03:49.881
Yeah. I, uh, guess I'll
see you tomorrow, Deputy.

03:54.538 --> 03:55.757
Get home
quick, okay?

03:55.887 --> 03:56.888
Right. Yeah. Yes, ma'am.

04:26.222 --> 04:27.702
Hey. We all clear?

04:27.832 --> 04:28.659
Looks like.

04:30.792 --> 04:32.750
Alright.

04:32.881 --> 04:34.578
Well, go on home.
I'll see you in the morning.

04:37.581 --> 04:38.539
Night, Sheriff.

05:10.832 --> 05:12.573
Frank!
Get the fuck up!

05:15.097 --> 05:17.534
Come on, Frank!
Gotta get home!

05:17.665 --> 05:18.535
It's getting
dark out.

05:21.146 --> 05:21.973
Frank!

05:24.280 --> 05:26.108
Oh, fuck it.

05:26.238 --> 05:27.979
-Lauren's gonna kill you.

05:45.780 --> 05:48.130
Is Daddy
coming home?

05:48.260 --> 05:50.132
Any second now.

05:50.262 --> 05:52.134
He's supposed to be
home before it gets dark.

05:52.264 --> 05:54.745
He promised.

05:54.876 --> 05:57.705
Well, sometimes, your dad,
he just gets a little forgetful.

05:57.835 --> 06:00.316
That's all. You go start saying
your prayers.

06:00.447 --> 06:01.622
I'll be there in
a minute.

06:01.752 --> 06:02.579
Okay.

06:05.277 --> 06:06.888
Goddamn it, Frank.

06:21.903 --> 06:23.383
Now I lay me
down to sleep.

06:23.513 --> 06:26.211
I pray the Lord my
soul to keep.

06:26.342 --> 06:28.300
If I die
before I wake,

06:28.431 --> 06:29.954
I pray the Lord my
soul to take.

06:45.361 --> 06:47.145
Meagan?

06:47.276 --> 06:49.278
It's Grandma.

06:49.409 --> 06:50.975
Come to the window.

06:51.106 --> 06:53.761
But I'm
not supposed to.

06:53.891 --> 06:54.762
It's okay.

06:54.892 --> 06:55.893
I won't tell.

06:57.808 --> 06:59.506
It'll be our
little secret.

07:00.942 --> 07:02.204
Do you promise?

07:02.334 --> 07:04.249
I promise,

07:04.380 --> 07:06.251
and I would
never break a promise.

07:16.784 --> 07:17.611
Oh.

07:20.440 --> 07:23.965
I've missed you
so much.

07:24.095 --> 07:25.662
Meagan, what
are you doing?

07:25.793 --> 07:27.142
You don't look
like my grandma.

07:27.272 --> 07:28.796
She's not
your grandma.

07:28.926 --> 07:31.625
I'm so lonely.

07:31.755 --> 07:33.627
Baby, please just--

07:33.757 --> 07:34.932
Maybe I can come in.

07:36.151 --> 07:37.848
Meagan, no!

10:10.131 --> 10:12.220
Norman,
you're gonna be okay.

10:12.350 --> 10:14.004
The secret fairies
are on their way back

10:14.135 --> 10:15.179
from the Lake of Tears.

10:15.310 --> 10:17.051
They're gonna
fix you!

10:17.181 --> 10:20.750
No. The monster's
claws went too deep.

10:22.534 --> 10:25.189
Tell my friends I'll
miss them.

10:25.320 --> 10:29.150
Tell my parents
I said goodbye.

10:29.280 --> 10:31.413
Norman?

10:31.543 --> 10:35.286
Norman! Norman! No, please!

10:35.417 --> 10:37.245
You're my
best friend!

10:37.375 --> 10:41.118
Please, please,
Norman, no!

10:43.468 --> 10:47.037
But the fairies are coming
from the Lake of Tears, right?

10:47.168 --> 10:48.473
They're gonna
make him better.

10:48.604 --> 10:50.214
Sorry, buddy.

10:50.345 --> 10:51.912
Norman's dead,

10:52.042 --> 10:53.478
and when you're
dead, you're gone.

10:53.609 --> 10:54.523
Bring him back!

10:54.654 --> 10:56.438
You have to
bring him back!

10:56.568 --> 10:58.222
Yeah. Sometimes,
life is hard, kid.

10:58.353 --> 11:01.225
Mom, Julie
killed Norman!

11:01.356 --> 11:02.487
Julie.

11:02.618 --> 11:04.925
What? I'm telling
him a story.

11:05.055 --> 11:08.102
Mom, Julie killed Norman!

11:08.232 --> 11:09.320
Julie, what
are you doing?

11:16.545 --> 11:17.415
Okay.

11:21.332 --> 11:23.465
Hey. What happened
to Norman?

11:23.595 --> 11:25.380
The monsters killed them.

11:25.510 --> 11:26.816
The monsters killed him?

11:29.384 --> 11:32.517
-Well, that's good news, then.
-Why?

11:32.648 --> 11:36.696
Because there's no such
thing as monsters, honey,

11:36.826 --> 11:38.741
and if there's no such
thing as monsters,

11:38.872 --> 11:42.571
then that means that Norman's
still alive, doesn't it?

11:42.702 --> 11:44.094
Really?

11:44.225 --> 11:46.444
Mm-hmm. Play with Norman.

12:30.662 --> 12:31.533
Mornin'.

12:33.448 --> 12:35.276
What is
it this time?

12:35.406 --> 12:37.234
Lauren rope you guys
into another bake-off, or what?

12:42.326 --> 12:43.284
Motherfucker.

12:45.112 --> 12:46.374
What'd I tell
you, Frank?

12:46.504 --> 12:47.418
It got late,
and I didn't--

12:49.551 --> 12:52.597
You got kids, you
nail the window shut.

12:52.728 --> 12:55.775
You nail the motherfucking
window shut, Frank!

12:55.905 --> 12:57.254
-No. No.
-Right?

12:58.603 --> 13:00.780
No. I can't. Don't.

13:03.347 --> 13:05.088
Look. You wanna drink?
You wanna drink, huh?

13:05.219 --> 13:06.089
No.

13:06.220 --> 13:08.048
No! No! Ah!

13:08.178 --> 13:10.354
A man protects
his family, Frank!

13:10.485 --> 13:12.748
A man protects
his family!

13:12.879 --> 13:14.271
-I'm sorry.
-Look at what you did.

13:14.402 --> 13:16.273
I'm sorry. No!

13:16.404 --> 13:17.666
-Stop your crying.
-Ah! No!

13:17.797 --> 13:19.494
Look at what you
fucking did, Frank!

13:19.624 --> 13:20.800
Open your eyes
and look!

13:22.062 --> 13:23.498
Look at what you
did! Look at them!

13:23.628 --> 13:25.021
Look at them! Look at her!

13:25.152 --> 13:27.023
-No! No!
-Look at her!

13:28.677 --> 13:30.418
No!

13:30.548 --> 13:32.594
-No? You can't, huh?
-I can't.

13:32.724 --> 13:34.814
You can't?
You can't? Huh?

13:36.337 --> 13:37.555
Fuckin' look at her!

13:37.686 --> 13:38.556
Look at her!

13:38.687 --> 13:40.471
I-- I-- I can't!

13:43.692 --> 13:45.433
Lock him up.
You hear me?

13:45.563 --> 13:47.870
-Lock him up.

13:49.132 --> 13:50.307
I don't...

14:04.321 --> 14:05.366
They're all
yours, Father.

14:38.529 --> 14:40.705
You know what I was
thinking about this morning?

14:40.836 --> 14:42.664
-Mm?
-That first time

14:42.794 --> 14:44.318
we drove up
to see your folks.

14:46.320 --> 14:47.799
As I recall,

14:47.930 --> 14:49.671
I was driving my
'83 Volvo

14:49.801 --> 14:52.195
with metal on metal
posing as brakes,

14:52.326 --> 14:53.936
a passenger side door
that wouldn't open.

14:54.067 --> 14:56.678
My God.
That car was a deathtrap.

14:56.808 --> 14:58.201
Nah, car
was a champ.

15:03.467 --> 15:05.687
I was terrified my parents
were gonna hate you.

15:05.817 --> 15:07.123
But they
didn't, though.

15:08.820 --> 15:10.474
No.

15:10.605 --> 15:12.476
Sometimes, I
remember what it was like

15:12.607 --> 15:14.348
when it
wasn't like this.

15:15.479 --> 15:16.350
Like before.

15:19.701 --> 15:20.571
Don't do that.

15:20.702 --> 15:21.616
Do what?

15:27.622 --> 15:28.449
Shit.

15:52.429 --> 15:55.389
Why is there a tree
in the middle of the road?

15:55.519 --> 15:57.347
Must've gotten knocked down
in a storm or something.

15:59.045 --> 16:00.698
Well, that's a pretty
selective storm.

16:08.924 --> 16:11.274
Well, there was an exit
about a mile back.

16:11.405 --> 16:13.537
I think we're gonna
have to circle around.

16:13.668 --> 16:16.758
Maybe we can push
it with the RV.

16:16.888 --> 16:18.716
I don't think that's
gonna work, buddy.

16:20.936 --> 16:22.198
Dad, get me up.

16:23.808 --> 16:25.985
Come on.

16:57.494 --> 16:59.018
What are
they doing?

17:00.671 --> 17:02.456
Can we just
leave, please?

17:02.586 --> 17:04.458
Yeah. Come on.

17:04.588 --> 17:05.850
Jim!

17:09.028 --> 17:10.768
-Yeah.
-Come on, buddy.

17:31.093 --> 17:33.400
We have an
arrangement, Sheriff.

17:33.530 --> 17:35.576
You don't come here.

17:35.706 --> 17:37.404
I came to see my
son, Donna.

17:40.537 --> 17:42.061
Please.

17:44.541 --> 17:45.499
Come on in, then.

18:24.015 --> 18:24.886
What?

18:27.018 --> 18:29.847
You're like a poem.
You know that?

18:29.978 --> 18:31.719
You make everything
around you beautiful.

18:35.418 --> 18:36.419
Even this place.

18:47.169 --> 18:49.432
Sheriff Stevens.

18:50.825 --> 18:52.392
Hello, Fatima.

18:52.522 --> 18:54.437
You should come by
more often.

18:54.568 --> 18:57.136
Yeah. Yeah.

19:01.531 --> 19:03.794
I will give
you boys a minute.

19:10.061 --> 19:12.455
I mean, she doesn't
change, does she?

19:14.153 --> 19:15.197
What are
you doing here?

19:16.459 --> 19:18.853
Yeah. Well, uh...

19:23.553 --> 19:25.468
we lost a couple
people last night.

19:25.599 --> 19:26.469
Oh, did we?

19:28.558 --> 19:29.820
And how exactly
did we lose them?

19:31.692 --> 19:35.261
Lauren Pratt and
her little girl, Meagan.

19:37.306 --> 19:38.916
-Lauren was the--
-Yeah, I know who Lauren is.

19:43.312 --> 19:47.795
It might be nice if you
came to the service,

19:47.925 --> 19:50.232
paid your respects.

19:50.363 --> 19:51.973
Look. I'm a little
busy, so if that's all...

19:54.105 --> 19:55.194
That's all.

19:57.979 --> 19:59.633
That's all.

19:59.763 --> 20:00.547
I thought I...

20:04.203 --> 20:05.856
I'll show
myself out.

20:14.865 --> 20:17.607
-Fatima.
-Bye.

20:29.445 --> 20:32.231
Can we go back to someplace that
resembles civilization?

20:34.842 --> 20:36.931
I mean, maybe we missed
the sign for the highway?

20:37.061 --> 20:38.846
We didn't miss
the sign.

20:38.976 --> 20:42.415
Dad? Dad, how come
those crows were doing that?

20:42.545 --> 20:43.633
I don't know, buddy.

20:43.764 --> 20:45.809
Sometimes, crows do
funny things.

20:45.940 --> 20:47.855
Ca-caw! Ca-caw!

20:55.254 --> 20:57.256
Are you sure we're going in
the right direction?

20:57.386 --> 20:59.475
I mean, I-- I don't see
the highway anymore.

20:59.606 --> 21:00.694
Do you have
cell reception?

21:02.913 --> 21:04.480
-No.
-I don't know.

21:04.611 --> 21:05.568
At some point,
this has to...

21:24.239 --> 21:25.414
What the...

21:30.854 --> 21:32.552
Why are all the tires flat?

21:38.122 --> 21:43.127
And so, we commit to the earth
Lauren and Meagan Pratt.

21:43.258 --> 21:46.957
May the life they know
beyond this world be kinder,

21:47.088 --> 21:50.134
and may the mysteries of
their time here be solved.

21:50.265 --> 21:52.223
For the peace we shall
know in the kingdom of God

21:52.354 --> 21:55.879
is certain,
and in that peace...

22:06.281 --> 22:08.762
Why are they
looking at us?

22:08.892 --> 22:09.937
Shit.

22:14.333 --> 22:16.813
Um, and
in that peace...

22:16.944 --> 22:19.773
And in that peace,

22:19.903 --> 22:22.645
we can be sure Lauren and
Meagan now reside.

22:22.776 --> 22:24.691
-Hey. Lock the doors.
-Jim, Jim, Jim.

22:24.821 --> 22:25.909
-That's a funeral!
-Dad.

22:26.040 --> 22:26.997
-I'll be okay.
-Dad.

22:31.045 --> 22:34.353
Ashes to ashes,
dust to dust.

22:36.180 --> 22:37.486
Alright. Now...

22:39.445 --> 22:41.621
you all remember what it
was like for you.

22:42.709 --> 22:44.275
Just leave
these people be.

22:44.406 --> 22:47.888
Kenny and I'll
handle it. Okay?

22:48.018 --> 22:48.889
Amen.

22:49.019 --> 22:50.847
Amen.

22:50.978 --> 22:51.805
May they go
with God.

22:58.812 --> 23:00.422
Excuse me. Could you
tell me where, uh...

23:04.470 --> 23:07.168
Hey. I was wondering if you
could tell me where, uh...

23:09.431 --> 23:12.042
Well, they seem like
a cheery group.

23:12.173 --> 23:14.218
What's going on?

23:14.349 --> 23:15.959
It's okay.

23:16.090 --> 23:17.613
Can I help you?

23:17.744 --> 23:19.310
Oh, yeah.

23:19.441 --> 23:21.225
Sorry to interrupt
your service.

23:21.356 --> 23:22.749
No. Not a problem.

23:22.879 --> 23:24.011
We were
just wrapping up.

23:24.141 --> 23:25.839
Well, we got on a
detour off the highway,

23:25.969 --> 23:27.797
and, uh, cell service
around here is--

23:27.928 --> 23:29.059
Got your family
with you?

23:32.802 --> 23:33.716
Yeah.

23:38.025 --> 23:39.287
I was wondering if you could
point me

23:39.418 --> 23:41.507
in the direction of the highway.

23:43.509 --> 23:44.945
Yeah. You just, uh--

23:45.075 --> 23:47.861
You just keep on following
the road right up that hill,

23:47.991 --> 23:49.123
right where you were
going, and, uh...

23:50.690 --> 23:51.560
you'll see.

23:55.999 --> 23:58.611
Again, apologies.

23:58.741 --> 23:59.568
Not a problem.

24:10.187 --> 24:11.232
Unlock the door.

24:11.362 --> 24:12.189
Go.

24:16.106 --> 24:18.065
-What did he say?

24:18.195 --> 24:20.154
Just keep going up the road
and we'll find it.

24:47.398 --> 24:49.792
How far did he say
the highway was?

24:49.923 --> 24:51.968
He didn't. He just said,
"Stay on the road."

24:55.232 --> 24:56.886
Hey!

24:57.017 --> 25:00.063
You know there's a name for
what those crows did back there,

25:00.194 --> 25:02.892
when they all, like, got
in a group like that?

25:03.023 --> 25:04.328
It's called
a murder.

25:04.459 --> 25:06.896
What? No, it's not.

25:07.027 --> 25:09.290
Yeah, it is. It's called
a murder of crows.

25:09.420 --> 25:11.074
'Cause when
they gather like that,

25:11.205 --> 25:12.772
it means they're
looking for a victim.

25:12.902 --> 25:13.903
And if you
see them doing it,

25:14.034 --> 25:15.426
then you're the one
they murder.

25:15.557 --> 25:17.733
Shut up.
You're making that up.

25:17.864 --> 25:20.083
I'm not.
Once they see you,

25:20.214 --> 25:22.216
they won't stop
hunting you.

25:22.346 --> 25:23.739
And one night when
you're sleeping,

25:23.870 --> 25:26.525
they'll come into your room and
crawl under your sheets,

25:26.655 --> 25:28.091
and they'll peck
at your face--

25:28.222 --> 25:29.223
-Stop it!
-and your eyes--

25:29.353 --> 25:30.267
-Stop it!
--and your ears.

25:30.398 --> 25:32.966
Stop it!
Mom, tell her to stop!

25:33.096 --> 25:34.837
Goddamn it, Julie!
Knock it off!

25:36.665 --> 25:38.537
You're such a baby.

25:48.198 --> 25:48.938
Honey, you know what?

25:51.288 --> 25:52.768
I don't think those
were even crows.

25:54.204 --> 25:55.815
They looked like--

25:55.945 --> 25:57.860
They looked like
ravens to me,

25:57.991 --> 25:59.688
and you know what a group
of ravens are called?

26:02.125 --> 26:03.344
An unkindness.

26:07.348 --> 26:09.829
An unkindness of ravens.

26:09.959 --> 26:11.352
That doesn't sound
that bad, huh?

26:11.482 --> 26:12.309
No.

26:18.315 --> 26:22.058
Wait, wait, wait.
Did we turn somewhere?

26:22.189 --> 26:23.103
No. I just...

26:29.500 --> 26:31.111
Oh, this can't be
the same place.

26:32.721 --> 26:34.418
This is
getting really creepy.

26:40.033 --> 26:40.860
Excuse me.

26:42.862 --> 26:45.604
We're trying to get back onto
the highway. Could you...

26:49.129 --> 26:50.043
Are you kidding me?

26:52.741 --> 26:54.874
Let's just go. We-- we
probably missed the turn.

27:09.932 --> 27:10.759
There you are.

27:12.108 --> 27:14.241
Just heading back down
to the barn.

27:14.371 --> 27:16.112
Those new people still
driving around, huh?

27:16.243 --> 27:17.723
It's the worst part.

27:18.680 --> 27:20.116
When you still expect
to find the road

27:20.247 --> 27:21.248
that takes you home.

27:22.553 --> 27:23.772
It's the part that's cruel.

27:24.947 --> 27:25.774
Hey, you okay?

27:27.123 --> 27:29.169
I'm fine.

27:29.299 --> 27:30.736
You're a
good brother.

27:30.866 --> 27:33.608
Now, get. Those animals
aren't gonna feed themselves.

27:33.739 --> 27:35.218
It'd be cool if
they did, though, right?

27:37.351 --> 27:38.308
I'll be back
in a bit.

27:52.714 --> 27:55.282
Maybe it's-- Maybe it's
more of, like, um--

27:55.412 --> 27:56.849
What's that--
What's that word?

27:56.979 --> 27:58.241
Like, a switchback.

27:58.372 --> 27:59.982
You know what I'm
talking about?

28:00.113 --> 28:01.375
Like, like, you
merge getting on,

28:01.505 --> 28:03.986
but then to get back, you'd
almost have to do, like,

28:04.117 --> 28:06.075
a U-turn to get back on
the original road.

28:06.206 --> 28:08.295
I would have noticed if we'd
merged with another road.

28:08.425 --> 28:10.036
Well, you obviously
didn't, Jim,

28:10.166 --> 28:11.341
because we're
driving in circles.

28:11.472 --> 28:12.516
Just drive slow.

28:12.647 --> 28:13.822
I'm driving slow.

28:18.697 --> 28:20.263
You have
to drive slow!

28:20.394 --> 28:21.525
Jim, we're gonna
pass it again!

28:21.656 --> 28:23.223
Pass what, Tabitha?

28:23.353 --> 28:26.139
What? Switchback?
Where is it?

28:26.269 --> 28:27.053
Show it to me.

28:29.577 --> 28:32.058
I'm-- I'm driving 20
miles an hour, alright?

28:32.188 --> 28:33.146
I can't drive any...

28:36.149 --> 28:36.932
Goddamn it.

28:42.633 --> 28:44.548
No, no, no, no.
This is impossible.

28:44.679 --> 28:46.725
We didn't go in
a circle that time.

28:48.248 --> 28:49.640
You drove out
this way.

28:49.771 --> 28:51.904
How did we
get back here?

28:52.034 --> 28:56.560
No. No. This... No.

29:14.665 --> 29:16.058
You think
they're ready?

29:16.189 --> 29:17.930
Go ahead.
Get the strip.

29:28.810 --> 29:30.464
How is this possible?

29:30.594 --> 29:32.683
The same road can't go
in a circle one time

29:32.814 --> 29:34.511
and then go in a--

29:34.642 --> 29:36.252
We're on the same
fucking road!

29:42.084 --> 29:43.129
Oh, my God, Jim.

29:43.259 --> 29:45.261
We should ask them.
Maybe they know.

29:46.480 --> 29:47.916
-Oh!

29:48.047 --> 29:48.917
Oh, my God!

29:59.101 --> 30:00.973
No.

30:02.235 --> 30:04.411
No, no, no, no!

30:04.541 --> 30:06.587
No, no, no!

30:09.808 --> 30:13.550
Tabby? Come here, baby.

30:13.681 --> 30:17.076
Tabby? Tabby.

30:17.206 --> 30:18.468
I need to hear from you
both back there.

30:20.906 --> 30:23.386
Julie? Julie, I need
you to look at me.

30:23.517 --> 30:24.300
Are you okay?

30:26.389 --> 30:28.696
Yeah, uh, uh, yeah,
I think-- I think so.

30:28.827 --> 30:30.524
I just banged my back.

30:30.654 --> 30:33.440
Ethan?
Can you hear me?

30:33.570 --> 30:35.224
Ethan? Ethan!

30:37.183 --> 30:38.488
I'm stuck.

30:56.942 --> 30:59.379
Tabitha, baby,
come here.

30:59.509 --> 31:01.424
-Come here, honey.
-What's wrong with Mom?

31:01.555 --> 31:02.861
Is-- is she okay?

31:02.991 --> 31:05.080
-She's gonna be fine.

31:05.211 --> 31:07.126
We're all
gonna be fine.

31:07.256 --> 31:09.476
I'm gonna get
us out of here.

31:09.606 --> 31:11.695
-We all just got to...

31:11.826 --> 31:12.871
...hold still.

31:41.638 --> 31:43.945
Make sure you
cover it real well.

31:44.076 --> 31:47.644
Last thing we need is a goddamn
RV barreling through town.

31:47.775 --> 31:50.256
They had, uh,
Arizona plates.

31:50.386 --> 31:51.344
You ever been
to Arizona?

31:51.474 --> 31:53.215
Hey!

31:53.346 --> 31:55.478
-Hey, we need help!
-What the...

31:55.609 --> 31:57.437
-Was that guy in the RV?
-No.

31:57.567 --> 31:58.829
There's
been an accident.

31:58.960 --> 32:00.657
-What?
-It's-- it's really bad.

32:00.788 --> 32:02.137
Oh, okay.
How far up the road?

32:02.268 --> 32:03.922
-Um--
-Okay. Okay.

32:04.052 --> 32:06.011
We only have, like,
two hours of daylight left.

32:06.141 --> 32:08.883
Look. Get him to the clinic.
Watch your foot! Watch it!

32:09.014 --> 32:11.407
Grab Khatri and Kristi,
all the supplies you can,

32:11.538 --> 32:13.148
and you meet me
up the road, okay?

32:13.279 --> 32:14.280
And go, Kenny!
Hurry up!

32:14.410 --> 32:15.455
Okay!

32:17.761 --> 32:19.024
Tabby, baby,
come here.

32:20.416 --> 32:21.765
Come here, honey.

32:21.896 --> 32:23.550
Baby, wake up.

32:23.680 --> 32:25.378
-Tabby.

32:25.508 --> 32:26.596
Come here, baby.

32:26.727 --> 32:28.381
-Dad?
-Yeah. What is it?

32:28.511 --> 32:31.210
Dad,
I think he's bleeding.

32:31.340 --> 32:33.908
-Where?
-There's something in his leg!

32:34.039 --> 32:36.128
-What is it?
-I don't know! I can't see!

32:40.915 --> 32:42.699
-What happened?
-There was an accident.

32:42.830 --> 32:44.614
Hey, hey, hey,
what's your name?

32:44.745 --> 32:46.442
-It's Tobey.
-Tobey, I'm Kristi, okay?

32:46.573 --> 32:47.922
-I'm just gonna take a look.
-Ah.

32:48.053 --> 32:49.532
Okay. Keep some pressure
on it, alright?

32:49.663 --> 32:51.012
Gina!

32:52.231 --> 32:54.189
We're gonna get you
cleaned up, okay? Alright.

32:55.712 --> 32:58.498
Gina, I need some
help in here!

32:58.628 --> 33:01.414
Hey. Hey. Can you get him
cleaned up in the other room

33:01.544 --> 33:02.806
and just start an IV
if he needs it?

33:02.937 --> 33:04.243
-Okay, got it.
-There you go.

33:04.373 --> 33:05.287
You're gonna
be okay, okay?

33:07.463 --> 33:10.118
-Was it the RV?
-And another car.

33:10.249 --> 33:11.032
Yeah.

33:38.973 --> 33:40.627
Hey! You alright?

33:42.585 --> 33:43.499
Anything hurt?

33:43.630 --> 33:44.805
What happened?

33:44.935 --> 33:46.285
You were in
a car accident.

33:47.938 --> 33:51.246
-You okay?
-You have an amazing face.

33:51.377 --> 33:53.944
I have-- Hey, hey,
hey, hey.

33:54.075 --> 33:56.034
Look at me.
Look-- look-- look at me.

33:56.164 --> 33:57.861
-Hey, what are you on?
-What do you mean?

33:57.992 --> 33:59.776
-I'm on the ground.
-What-- Okay, okay.

33:59.907 --> 34:01.430
Uh, hold it. Hold it.
Hold on. Stay there.

34:01.561 --> 34:03.519
Anybody else
in here?

34:03.650 --> 34:04.477
-Um--
-Huh?

34:04.607 --> 34:05.913
-No, it's just us.
-Okay.

34:06.044 --> 34:09.743
Hey, I need you to
stay right here for me, okay?

34:09.873 --> 34:13.616
You just stay here.

34:13.747 --> 34:14.748
I'm not
going anywhere, man.

34:14.878 --> 34:16.228
-Okay.
-Alright.

34:16.358 --> 34:17.533
-Alright.
-Alright.

34:19.579 --> 34:20.362
Oh.

34:41.601 --> 34:44.256
Hey! Everybody in
there okay?

34:44.386 --> 34:45.735
Hello?

34:45.866 --> 34:48.173
No! We need some help!

34:52.046 --> 34:55.005
Hey. Hey. Oh.

34:55.136 --> 34:57.921
Okay. Alright. You're gonna be
fine. You're gonna be fine.

34:58.052 --> 35:00.054
We got some folks coming,
on the way, alright?

35:00.185 --> 35:02.361
My son is bleeding.
He's-- I, uh--

35:02.491 --> 35:04.014
-Okay. Alright.
-And I can't--

35:04.145 --> 35:05.668
-Okay. Hey!

35:05.799 --> 35:06.930
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Listen to me. Look.

35:07.061 --> 35:08.889
Hey, I'm gonna need you to calm
down, okay?

35:09.019 --> 35:10.717
-Alright.
-Alright? I know.

35:10.847 --> 35:12.893
I know. I know.
Hey, what's your name?

35:13.023 --> 35:14.677
Jim.

35:14.808 --> 35:16.288
Jim. Alright.
Hey, Jim,

35:16.418 --> 35:17.463
my name is Boyd.

35:17.593 --> 35:19.073
-Boyd?
-Boyd. Yeah.

35:19.204 --> 35:21.075
So, look, Jim.
I'm gonna climb up there,

35:21.206 --> 35:22.468
see if I can get
that door open, okay,

35:22.598 --> 35:24.687
and try and get you guys out.
That sound alright?

35:24.818 --> 35:25.775
-That's alright.
- Yeah?

35:25.906 --> 35:27.560
-It's okay with you, right?
-Mm-hmm.

35:45.795 --> 35:47.275
-Yeah. Yeah.
-Yeah.

35:57.677 --> 35:59.766
-Okay, she's good.
-Oh, thank God.

35:59.896 --> 36:01.985
Yeah. Okay. We gotta get
you out of here.

36:02.116 --> 36:03.987
-There's, uh, tools--
-One second. Yeah.

36:04.118 --> 36:05.598
-uh, along the side
there, on the--

36:05.728 --> 36:07.121
- Okay. Hey. Hey.
-Or that side.

36:07.252 --> 36:08.078
What's-- what's
her name?

36:08.209 --> 36:10.733
Uh, so, that's
Julie. Uh--

36:10.864 --> 36:13.127
Hey, Julie.
Julie, you okay?

36:13.258 --> 36:15.390
You're okay.
My name is Boyd, okay?

36:15.521 --> 36:16.348
Alright.

36:20.134 --> 36:21.744
Okay. Julie?

36:21.875 --> 36:24.312
Julie. We're okay. We're gonna
try to get you out of here.

36:24.443 --> 36:26.358
-Would that be okay?
-No. You need to get Ethan--

36:26.488 --> 36:28.751
Yeah. Yeah. We're gonna get him
too. We're gonna get him.

36:28.882 --> 36:30.710
-Everybody's coming.
-I love you, honey.

36:30.840 --> 36:32.059
-Alright, come on. There you go.
-Ow!

36:32.190 --> 36:33.191
Good girl. Good start.

36:41.982 --> 36:43.157
Hey, Ellis!

36:43.288 --> 36:44.941
There's been an
accident outside town!

36:45.072 --> 36:47.161
-We could use your help!
-What?

36:47.292 --> 36:49.555
The RV with the family,
it collided with another car!

36:49.685 --> 36:51.121
Your dad's
already out there!

36:51.252 --> 36:52.862
Wait. Hold on. Another car?
What are you talking about?

36:52.993 --> 36:54.647
Will you
just get in?

36:54.777 --> 36:56.953
We don't have a
lot of time!

36:57.084 --> 36:59.869
Ellis,
it'll be dark soon.

37:00.000 --> 37:01.219
He's your father.

37:23.632 --> 37:25.068
You just rest.
I'll be back soon.

37:25.199 --> 37:26.244
Mm-hmm.

37:28.985 --> 37:31.379
I don't like him.

37:31.510 --> 37:32.641
Why not?

37:32.772 --> 37:36.645
Look
at the mess he made.

37:36.776 --> 37:38.734
Well, that's not
exactly his fault.

37:38.865 --> 37:40.780
I don't like.

37:40.910 --> 37:42.303
Let's get you
downstairs.

37:54.924 --> 37:55.882
Hey.

37:57.623 --> 37:59.146
-You okay?
-I'm great.

37:59.277 --> 38:00.843
What's your name?

38:00.974 --> 38:02.280
I'm Jade.

38:02.410 --> 38:04.673
Hi, Jade. Any pain
or anything like that?

38:04.804 --> 38:06.240
-What's your name?
-I'm Kristi.

38:06.371 --> 38:07.937
Alright.
We got it. We got it.

38:08.068 --> 38:10.636
-You got it. You got it.

38:10.766 --> 38:11.854
-You got it. You got it.
-Oh!

38:11.985 --> 38:13.116
Come on. Come on.
Come on.

38:13.247 --> 38:14.857
There you go.

38:14.988 --> 38:17.730
Alright.
Alright. Look.

38:17.860 --> 38:19.558
I'm gonna go back
and get the others, okay?

38:19.688 --> 38:21.124
Just sit here.
Try-- try to relax.

38:21.255 --> 38:22.865
Calm down. Okay?

38:28.044 --> 38:28.915
Sheriff!

38:30.438 --> 38:32.092
Sheriff, are
you down there?

38:32.222 --> 38:33.311
Yeah!

38:34.268 --> 38:36.009
You see that?

38:36.139 --> 38:37.880
Hey, the cavalry's here.

38:39.360 --> 38:41.536
You're gonna
be okay. Alright.

38:49.805 --> 38:51.067
God, you're beautiful.

38:51.198 --> 38:52.242
Can you squeeze
my fingers?

38:52.373 --> 38:54.767
Squeeze. Squeeze.
Squeeze them harder.

38:54.897 --> 38:56.159
Great. Can you move
your toes?

38:56.290 --> 38:57.683
-Um--
-Lift up your feet.

38:57.813 --> 38:59.206
-My feet.
-Good. Good. Okay.

38:59.337 --> 39:02.165
Can you grab me the water
bottle from the car? Thanks.

39:03.079 --> 39:04.342
Hey, this one's got
New York plates.

39:04.472 --> 39:06.866
Weren't-- Weren't Sara and
Nathan from New York?

39:06.996 --> 39:08.694
Uh, they were
Boston, I think.

39:08.824 --> 39:10.913
Boston.
Right. Okay.

39:11.044 --> 39:12.001
Did you take
anything?

39:12.132 --> 39:13.002
What?

39:17.180 --> 39:20.619
-Are you nauseous or anything?
-No, no. Where's Tobey?

39:20.749 --> 39:22.534
-He's at the clinic.
-Okay.

39:22.664 --> 39:24.405
-He's okay.
-Okay.

39:25.667 --> 39:27.756
Kristi!

39:27.887 --> 39:30.063
You should get down there.
Looks pretty bad.

39:30.193 --> 39:33.196
Okay. Um, here. Make sure
that he doesn't hurt himself,

39:33.327 --> 39:34.372
and plenty of water, okay?

39:34.502 --> 39:39.202
Right. Hey, it's
gonna be okay. Drink.

39:39.333 --> 39:42.380
Oh, my God.
You're all so beautiful.

39:45.339 --> 39:46.384
Careful.

40:14.368 --> 40:15.717
How are
you feeling?

40:15.848 --> 40:16.718
Uh...

40:18.894 --> 40:20.592
Where's the doctor?

40:22.376 --> 40:23.464
She had to go.

40:24.857 --> 40:25.945
But it's okay.

40:27.207 --> 40:28.034
You're safe now.

40:34.388 --> 40:36.564
Everything's going
to be alright.

40:38.740 --> 40:39.785
You just rest.

40:54.364 --> 40:56.149
Okay.
Make sure you lift her up.

40:56.279 --> 40:57.629
-I am!
-Come on, buddy.

40:59.979 --> 41:00.849
Mom?

41:02.111 --> 41:04.462
Mom! Mom!

41:04.592 --> 41:06.246
Okay. Oh, easy, easy!
Okay. Take it easy.

41:06.376 --> 41:07.856
-Hi!
-Hi.

41:07.987 --> 41:09.379
Easy.

41:09.510 --> 41:10.859
Are you--
Are you okay?

41:10.990 --> 41:12.165
-Yeah. I'm okay.
-You're okay?

41:12.295 --> 41:13.775
-I'm okay.
-Okay. Uh--

41:13.906 --> 41:15.168
Yes. Yes.

41:15.298 --> 41:16.952
Where's-- where's Daddy?

41:17.083 --> 41:19.259
-Where's Ethan?
-They're still in the RV.

41:19.389 --> 41:21.261
-It's okay.
-They're-- Oh, my God.

41:21.391 --> 41:22.958
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa--
-Mom!

41:23.089 --> 41:24.743
-Get her up, get her up.
-Alright.

41:24.873 --> 41:25.961
-It's okay. It's okay--
-Hey!

41:26.092 --> 41:27.876
-We need to get her to sit down.
-Mom, sit.

41:28.007 --> 41:29.356
They're still--
they're still there!

41:29.487 --> 41:30.792
Hey, go tell them
she's awake!

41:30.923 --> 41:31.967
Right!
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

41:32.098 --> 41:33.969
No, but they're--
they're still there. Go--

41:34.100 --> 41:35.928
-It's okay.
-It's okay. It's okay.

41:36.058 --> 41:37.712
-Are you okay, honey?
-Yes, I'm okay, Mom.

41:37.843 --> 41:38.887
-You're okay.
-It's okay, Mom.

41:39.018 --> 41:40.889
Okay. Well, good news is
that he's stable.

41:41.020 --> 41:42.412
-Yeah.
-His airway's clear, his pulses

41:42.543 --> 41:44.937
are strong, and there's no
obvious damage to the artery.

41:45.067 --> 41:46.373
-Bad news?
-I mean, there's a table leg

41:46.504 --> 41:48.941
through his thigh. We can't
exactly just yank him--

41:49.071 --> 41:51.204
How much time you
need to do it right?

41:51.334 --> 41:55.425
-I don't know. At least an hour.
-The mom's awake.

41:55.556 --> 41:58.777
And we got, like, 40 minutes
of daylight left, so...

41:58.907 --> 42:01.344
-Can you fix him in the RV?
-What?

42:01.475 --> 42:03.216
Can you stitch the
kid up inside the RV?

42:03.346 --> 42:04.783
Well, I don't know--

42:07.873 --> 42:09.831
Will that even work?

42:12.007 --> 42:12.791
I don't know.

42:15.445 --> 42:16.664
It'll work.

42:18.274 --> 42:20.842
-Kristi.
-It'll work.

42:20.973 --> 42:23.105
It's alright, boy.

42:23.236 --> 42:24.150
That's alright.

42:33.463 --> 42:36.249
Hey. It's Jim, right?

42:36.379 --> 42:38.207
-Yeah.
-Hey. Okay.

42:38.338 --> 42:40.035
Very important to
keep him flat, okay?

42:43.735 --> 42:45.432
We can't rule out a
spinal or a neck injury.

42:45.563 --> 42:47.303
-Okay? Good. Yeah.

42:47.434 --> 42:48.478
-Support him.
-That?

42:48.609 --> 42:50.350
Yep. Support
his neck like that. Good.

42:50.480 --> 42:54.049
Gentle. Good.
Nice and soft. Good.

42:54.180 --> 42:55.485
Okay. Perfect.

42:55.616 --> 42:57.139
Okay.
Your wife's awake.

42:59.228 --> 43:00.229
You should
go talk to her.

43:00.360 --> 43:01.230
Alright.

43:02.492 --> 43:04.233
I can take it from here.

43:04.364 --> 43:05.757
You sure?

43:05.887 --> 43:06.801
Yeah.

43:16.506 --> 43:17.986
-Be careful.
-Thanks.

43:19.161 --> 43:19.988
Okay.

43:36.744 --> 43:38.180
I just want
to see my kid.

43:38.311 --> 43:39.268
-I understand.
-Tabby.

43:39.399 --> 43:40.487
-I--
-Yeah. Hi.

43:40.618 --> 43:42.315
Hey, Jim.

43:42.445 --> 43:46.362
Hi. Jim, where-- where--
where-- where is he?

43:46.493 --> 43:50.149
He's okay, uh, but
he's, uh... stuck.

43:50.279 --> 43:52.064
But there's a doctor here
that's gonna help him get out.

43:52.194 --> 43:53.239
Yeah.

43:53.369 --> 43:54.240
There's...

43:56.024 --> 43:57.460
He says we
have to leave.

43:57.591 --> 43:58.810
-What?
-Look.

43:58.940 --> 44:01.377
We don't have a lot of
time to talk about this.

44:01.508 --> 44:03.249
We're not
leaving anywhere.

44:03.379 --> 44:05.120
Please listen to me.

44:05.251 --> 44:07.209
These woods are not
safe after dark.

44:07.340 --> 44:09.603
Hey, if you wanna stay,
that's fine,

44:09.734 --> 44:11.953
but you, you can barely
stand, and your daughter

44:12.084 --> 44:13.912
-needs to get back to town.
-It's okay.

44:14.042 --> 44:15.827
-It's alright.
-Hey. Hey.

44:15.957 --> 44:17.437
Yeah.

44:17.567 --> 44:19.308
I don't want to
bury any more kids.

44:19.439 --> 44:21.310
Alright? Come on.

44:39.502 --> 44:41.026
Where are we?

44:43.289 --> 44:44.203
Is everyone okay?

44:47.032 --> 44:47.989
I don't think so.

44:53.952 --> 44:54.909
Oh, God.

44:57.129 --> 45:00.567
I-- I-- I shouldn't
have been--

45:00.698 --> 45:01.916
Shh.

45:02.047 --> 45:04.571
Fuck. Why did I--

45:04.702 --> 45:05.703
Shh.

45:25.505 --> 45:27.028
This isn't your fault.

45:28.290 --> 45:29.378
What do you mean?

45:40.259 --> 45:42.522
That asshole handcuffed to
the car gives you any trouble,

45:42.652 --> 45:45.960
you cut him loose.
You hear me?

45:46.091 --> 45:47.309
Thank you for coming.

45:51.618 --> 45:53.098
Look. You know
this is suicide.

45:56.754 --> 45:58.016
Just take care of
the family.

46:08.591 --> 46:10.376
Look. I'm staying.

46:10.506 --> 46:12.770
My baby's in there.

46:12.900 --> 46:14.336
How am I
supposed to just...

46:16.164 --> 46:18.427
Jim, let's just--
Let's just walk over.

46:18.558 --> 46:20.342
We'll get Thomas, and we'll
just get out of here.

46:20.473 --> 46:21.169
-Jim, please.
-Tabby.

46:23.215 --> 46:24.085
It's Ethan.

46:26.261 --> 46:27.828
Ethan's the one stuck in the RV.

46:30.875 --> 46:33.355
It's okay. It's okay.

46:34.530 --> 46:35.401
It's okay.

46:38.534 --> 46:39.622
I know. I'm sorry.

46:39.753 --> 46:41.624
It's just my head.

46:41.755 --> 46:45.063
It just hurts.

46:45.193 --> 46:47.369
The doctor needs
to focus on Ethan.

46:47.500 --> 46:49.241
-If she's worried about you...
-Yeah.

46:49.371 --> 46:50.590
...she can't do
what she has to do.

46:50.720 --> 46:53.158
No, no, no, no.
She-- she has to stay-- Yeah.

46:55.508 --> 46:58.772
Jim, I don't-- I don't
trust these people.

46:58.903 --> 47:01.644
There's something
really weird. I don't...

47:01.775 --> 47:03.646
What does it mean,
"The woods aren't safe"?

47:03.777 --> 47:05.823
What is that? What?
The woods aren't safe?

47:05.953 --> 47:08.390
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I know this is, uh...

47:08.521 --> 47:09.652
But we gotta go.

47:09.783 --> 47:10.566
Like, right now.

47:12.568 --> 47:14.092
-Jim, I can't go.
-Right now.

47:14.222 --> 47:16.224
Like, we gotta go. Come on.
Let's go.

47:21.273 --> 47:23.362
-Okay.

47:23.492 --> 47:25.494
So, we have to separate
the table leg from the table,

47:25.625 --> 47:27.583
and it's gonna be dark out, so
do you have any lanterns

47:27.714 --> 47:29.063
or lights or anything like that?

47:29.194 --> 47:30.412
Yeah. Uh, got, uh--

47:30.543 --> 47:32.588
-I got lamps.
-Great.

47:32.719 --> 47:36.201
Uh, got lanterns.

47:41.597 --> 47:42.511
Perfect.

48:10.844 --> 48:13.151
-Got it.
-Okay.

48:13.281 --> 48:14.761
-How we doing in here?
-Uh, good.

48:14.892 --> 48:15.893
Uh, we're almost
ready to go.

48:16.023 --> 48:17.198
-Yeah.
-Okay, Jim.

48:17.329 --> 48:19.679
I'm gonna need you around
here, just to support

48:19.809 --> 48:21.550
-the head and neck, okay?
-Okay.

48:23.944 --> 48:26.860
Hey, Jim? Would you grab
me that blanket right there?

48:26.991 --> 48:28.601
Right by your-- by your left
foot. Right there.

48:28.731 --> 48:29.558
-Yup.
-Thanks.

48:45.748 --> 48:46.706
What are you doing?

48:49.796 --> 48:51.145
I am, uh...

48:52.842 --> 48:55.236
doing my best
to keep the RV safe.

49:17.389 --> 49:19.434
Shit! Shit! Shit, shit, shit,
shit, shit, shit.

49:19.565 --> 49:21.915
You left the fucking
spike strip down!

49:22.046 --> 49:24.439
It's okay. It's okay.
We can make it to Colony House.

49:24.570 --> 49:25.919
That's if they open the door
for us.

49:26.050 --> 49:27.703
They'll open the door!
Alright? Come on.

49:27.834 --> 49:29.357
-Let's go.
-Hey, hey, hey, hey.

49:29.488 --> 49:31.925
It's very important that we get
inside as soon as possible,

49:32.056 --> 49:34.449
so that means that-- that means
that you run as fast as you can.

49:34.580 --> 49:36.538
No matter what you see,
no matter what you hear,

49:36.669 --> 49:38.540
you do not stop. You understand
me? No matter what.

49:38.671 --> 49:39.585
- Go, go, go.
-Come on!

49:47.027 --> 49:49.595
What do you mean,
"make the RV safe"?

49:49.725 --> 49:51.510
What?

49:51.640 --> 49:52.467
Safe from what?

49:55.427 --> 49:57.951
Jim... there are things you
need to understand

49:58.082 --> 49:59.126
about what
happens next.

49:59.257 --> 50:01.172
Dad?

50:01.302 --> 50:04.305
Ah. Hi, honey.

50:04.436 --> 50:05.567
It hurts.

50:05.698 --> 50:08.788
-I know.
-Okay. Okay. He's awake.

50:08.918 --> 50:10.442
We're gonna take
care of you, though.

50:10.572 --> 50:11.660
Everything's gonna
be just fine.

50:13.662 --> 50:15.882
Shit. Hold his neck. Great.

50:16.013 --> 50:17.927
-Ethan. Ethan. Ethan.
-Good, good--

50:18.058 --> 50:19.755
We just gotta support the airway
like that. Good. Yeah.

50:19.886 --> 50:21.192
Oh, come on.

50:21.322 --> 50:23.368
Use your forearms
a little bit more.

50:23.498 --> 50:24.456
-Kristi?
-We're fine.

50:24.586 --> 50:25.761
Just keep
covering the windows.

50:25.892 --> 50:27.459
Jim, I need you
right under his neck, okay?

50:27.589 --> 50:30.418
Use your forearms to get right
under his head, just like that.

50:30.549 --> 50:32.594
-Ethan, Ethan, Ethan.
-Yeah. You're doing great.

50:32.725 --> 50:33.595
Good, good, good, good.

50:55.487 --> 50:56.357
Oh, come on.

50:57.924 --> 50:59.404
They're comin'.
