<i>Ready.</i>

00:11.275 --> 00:12.642
<i>Set, hut!</i>

00:18.716 --> 00:21.583
<i>Nice job, nice job.
Tempo, tempo. Let's go.</i>

00:21.585 --> 00:22.851
<i>On the ball, on the ball. Let's go.</i>

00:22.853 --> 00:23.819
<i>On the ball, let's go.</i>

00:23.821 --> 00:25.354
<i>Reset.</i>

00:25.356 --> 00:27.124
<i>Tempo, tempo. Let's pick
it up this time, boys.</i>

00:27.126 --> 00:29.292
<i>What personnel they got, Coach?
All right, let's change it.</i>

00:29.294 --> 00:31.293
<i>Wall right, wall right.</i>

00:31.295 --> 00:32.828
<i>Make sure you pick off the flyer.</i>

00:32.830 --> 00:35.430
<i>Here we go, here we
go. Everybody up!</i>

00:35.432 --> 00:36.699
<i>Ready. Set!</i>

00:40.304 --> 00:41.904
<i>- Watch the motion.
- Set, hut!</i>

00:41.906 --> 00:44.207
<i>There you go, get it, get it.
Turn up, turn up, turn up!</i>

00:44.209 --> 00:45.208
<i>Think fast! There you go.</i>

00:45.210 --> 00:46.543
<i>Just like this.</i>

00:46.545 --> 00:48.879
<i>There you go. Nice job. Nice job.</i>

00:56.154 --> 00:57.385
<i>Mike did. Someone to help me</i>

00:57.387 --> 00:58.854
<i>with maximum protection. Mike did.</i>

00:58.856 --> 01:00.857
<i>Someone to help me call
the play. Mike did.</i>

01:00.859 --> 01:03.659
<i>Someone to help me get the
team in line. Mike did it.</i>

01:03.661 --> 01:05.895
<i>Mike controlled it, Mike ran it.</i>

01:05.897 --> 01:09.898
<i>We needed him, we used
him, we leaned on him.</i>

01:09.900 --> 01:13.436
<i>He was our strength in our offense.</i>

01:13.438 --> 01:16.806
<i>I know this man. I know his
backside as well as anybody.</i>

01:18.376 --> 01:23.678
<i>Simply, nothing has ever
compared to Mike Webster.</i>

01:23.680 --> 01:25.748
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
the greatest center in</i>

01:25.750 --> 01:27.883
<i>the history of the
National Football League,</i>

01:27.885 --> 01:29.585
<i>your inductee into the Hall of Fame,</i>

01:29.587 --> 01:33.656
<i>number 52, "Iron Mike" Webster!</i>

01:40.230 --> 01:41.496
Way to go, Mike!

01:41.498 --> 01:43.633
<i>Uh...</i>

01:43.635 --> 01:46.302
<i>I'd like to begin...</i>

01:46.304 --> 01:51.942
<i>Um, obviously, I want it to be
fun, but I want to be truthful.</i>

01:53.411 --> 02:00.650
<i>'Cause the people out there are
tremendous fans, uh, locally.</i>

02:00.652 --> 02:05.320
<i>But as we, uh, as we go through
this, I want you to understand</i>

02:05.322 --> 02:08.257
<i>the greatest thing
that has happened to me</i>

02:08.258 --> 02:11.129
<i>in my experience of
professional football</i>

02:13.264 --> 02:19.869
<i>is to have the opportunity to work
with people with a common goal</i>

02:19.871 --> 02:23.208
<i>and with the same
purpose, and to sacrifice.</i>

02:32.616 --> 02:35.417
<i>I'll say this,</i>

02:35.419 --> 02:38.422
<i>it's painful playing
football, obviously.</i>

02:39.524 --> 02:42.291
<i>And, uh, it's not a
lot of fun out there</i>

02:42.293 --> 02:46.294
<i>to be in two-a-day drills
in the heat of the summer,</i>

02:46.296 --> 02:48.330
<i>and, uh, banging heads.</i>

02:48.332 --> 02:50.133
<i>It's not a natural thing.</i>

03:03.814 --> 03:07.417
<i>I was scared I'd fail. Honest
to God, I was scared I'd fail.</i>

03:08.620 --> 03:10.922
<i>I'm still scared of that.</i>

03:41.352 --> 03:46.056
<i>And all we have to do
is finish the game.</i>

03:47.491 --> 03:50.528
<i>If we finish, we win.</i>

03:54.064 --> 03:55.934
<i>Yeah.</i>

04:21.826 --> 04:25.461
The state has asked, after a lengthy trial,

04:25.463 --> 04:27.829
a death sentence and two appeals,

04:27.831 --> 04:30.832
why we would learn anything new from you.

04:30.834 --> 04:34.803
Dr. Omalu, do you have a medical degree?

04:34.805 --> 04:39.108
Uh, yes. From the University of Nigeria.

04:39.110 --> 04:42.812
At Enugu, Nigeria.

04:42.814 --> 04:44.613
And I did my residency

04:44.615 --> 04:49.719
at Columbia University
Medical School in New York.

04:49.721 --> 04:52.555
Um, I also have master's degrees

04:52.557 --> 04:56.024
in Public Health and Epidemiology.

04:56.026 --> 05:00.562
In addition, I am a
certified physician executive,

05:00.564 --> 05:04.399
uh, with a specialty in Emergency Medicine.

05:04.401 --> 05:06.801
And, of course, I'm board-certified

05:06.803 --> 05:12.108
in Forensic Pathology, Clinical
Pathology and Anatomic Pathology.

05:12.110 --> 05:17.613
Uh, my... My focus is Neuropathology,
the examination of the brain.

05:17.615 --> 05:20.149
- While working as a Medical...
- I'm sorry. So sorry. I'm sorry.

05:20.151 --> 05:24.986
Uh, I'm also completing my MBA
at Carnegie Mellon University.

05:26.824 --> 05:29.625
Oh, uh, and, uh, before I came to America,

05:29.627 --> 05:31.993
a master's degree in the Theory of Music

05:31.995 --> 05:35.032
from the Royal School of Music in London.

05:39.002 --> 05:42.738
Oh, but... Oh, your... Your original
question, uh, what can I add?

05:42.740 --> 05:44.409
Um...

05:45.675 --> 05:50.512
My specialty is the science of death.

05:50.514 --> 05:52.848
I think more about why people die

05:52.850 --> 05:56.054
than I do the way people live.

05:58.990 --> 06:01.623
Hands of the deceased.

06:01.625 --> 06:04.493
Broken and dislodged fingernails.

06:04.495 --> 06:10.200
The hands of a woman who fought
wildly for her life and lost.

06:11.802 --> 06:14.502
The hands of the
defendant, Thomas Chambers.

06:14.504 --> 06:17.072
And that is, in fact,
the blood of the victim.

06:17.074 --> 06:19.774
Now, doesn't that suggest that
the state has the right man?

06:19.776 --> 06:23.779
I thought so, until I heard hour 217

06:23.781 --> 06:25.947
of Mr. Chambers' police interview.

06:25.949 --> 06:30.786
I heard him very clearly
say, "I hate blood.

06:30.788 --> 06:33.122
"I had a tooth pulled as a child once

06:33.124 --> 06:35.690
"and it would not stop bleeding."

06:35.692 --> 06:37.993
- So, I got curious.
- What about?

06:37.995 --> 06:42.063
Hands. I could not reconcile
these conflicting sets of hands.

06:42.065 --> 06:44.065
So, my mind... My mind is... My mind

06:44.067 --> 06:46.034
is going mad, and I'm trying to figure out

06:46.036 --> 06:50.171
if Thomas Chambers' family
has a history of hemophilia.

06:50.173 --> 06:53.074
So, I asked his father
and, uh, his father said no.

06:53.076 --> 06:56.846
But there is a strain of
hemophilia, hemophilia A,

06:56.848 --> 06:59.949
so rare that it is never tested for.

06:59.951 --> 07:02.817
Mr. Chambers tested
positive for hemophilia A.

07:02.819 --> 07:05.687
His hands may have touched the victim,

07:05.689 --> 07:08.791
perhaps to aid her, as he claims.

07:08.793 --> 07:10.793
If his hands had been the murder weapon,

07:10.795 --> 07:12.827
if he had been scratched or bitten,

07:12.829 --> 07:15.197
he would have bled to death.

07:15.199 --> 07:18.968
If the state of Pennsylvania
moves forward to execute,

07:18.970 --> 07:22.673
you will be killing an innocent man.

08:30.774 --> 08:32.342
Way to go, Joe.

08:35.613 --> 08:36.778
Good morning, Gracie.

08:36.780 --> 08:38.214
Good morning, Dr. Omalu.

08:38.216 --> 08:40.715
- Here are the cases for today. Mmm-hmm.
- Okay. This is from yesterday.

08:40.717 --> 08:42.049
Hey, we got a full room today.

08:42.052 --> 08:43.753
- Cycle 'em through.
- Yes.

08:51.361 --> 08:53.797
Let's begin with Rachel Green.

09:18.389 --> 09:22.291
Okay, Rachel, I need your help.

09:22.293 --> 09:25.060
We are in this together.

09:25.062 --> 09:26.628
Please help me find out
what happened to you.

09:26.630 --> 09:28.162
Here we go.

09:28.164 --> 09:29.834
Danny, come on.

09:34.371 --> 09:36.305
Gracie.

09:36.307 --> 09:39.609
Dr. Omalu uses different
stuff. Makes less of a mess.

10:29.092 --> 10:31.225
<i>Possible causal relationship</i>

10:31.227 --> 10:35.730
<i>between self-medication
and early head trauma,</i>

10:35.732 --> 10:37.900
leading to narcotics abuse and overdose.

10:37.902 --> 10:40.268
You're not her shrink, Bennet!

10:40.270 --> 10:43.839
If I know how she lived,
I know why she died.

10:43.841 --> 10:45.840
And you should be careful, Danny.

10:45.842 --> 10:48.478
One day, I may be rushing
through your autopsy.

10:55.452 --> 10:58.921
<i>Dr. Wecht, Dr. Omalu
is here to see you.</i>

10:58.923 --> 11:02.190
You know the reason you're
not back in Nigeria, don't you?

11:02.192 --> 11:04.792
Uh, yes. Because I remind you of you.

11:04.794 --> 11:06.328
Only less handsome.

11:06.330 --> 11:07.932
Sit.

11:09.966 --> 11:12.334
What the hell is going on down there?

11:12.336 --> 11:14.402
Nothing. I'm doing my work. I'm fine.

11:14.404 --> 11:16.037
You're not fine.

11:16.039 --> 11:20.074
Danny hates your guts. I've
never seen anything like it.

11:20.076 --> 11:22.076
I think you're working a little too slow.

11:22.078 --> 11:23.445
I'm a doctor.

11:23.447 --> 11:26.949
The dead are my patients.
I treat them with respect.

11:26.951 --> 11:28.950
But do you have to talk to them?

11:28.952 --> 11:31.052
If you have to do that,
talk to them in your head.

11:32.356 --> 11:35.223
And we discussed the knives.
You're still throwing them away.

11:35.225 --> 11:37.493
We're a public agency in Pittsburgh.

11:37.495 --> 11:40.094
They're expensive. Reuse them.

11:40.096 --> 11:42.964
Would you want me to cut open your mother

11:42.966 --> 11:45.869
with the same knife I
used on a serial killer?

11:49.240 --> 11:50.539
Yes.

11:50.541 --> 11:52.174
I'd probably request it.

11:54.544 --> 11:56.445
Cyril.

11:56.447 --> 11:59.080
You need a girlfriend.

11:59.082 --> 12:01.752
You need to touch somebody
alive every once in a while.

12:02.952 --> 12:05.521
Living women are... Well,
occasionally they're a pain in the ass,

12:05.523 --> 12:07.122
but quite often, they're amazing.

12:07.124 --> 12:08.556
Give it a try.

12:08.558 --> 12:10.057
Okay.

12:10.059 --> 12:12.493
Just be a little less of an artist.

12:12.495 --> 12:15.464
- Fit in a little more.
- Yes.

12:15.466 --> 12:17.997
It's another death row case.

12:17.999 --> 12:19.368
The guy's being railroaded.

12:19.370 --> 12:21.939
$1,000 for you.

12:23.106 --> 12:24.675
Cyril.

12:26.509 --> 12:29.844
Uh...

12:56.874 --> 12:58.940
Webby.

12:58.942 --> 13:00.908
Hey, man.

13:00.910 --> 13:02.945
I am loving the digs.

13:05.182 --> 13:06.949
Mike.

13:06.951 --> 13:08.752
It's Justin.

13:10.321 --> 13:11.453
I'll just sit with you for a minute, huh?

13:11.455 --> 13:13.454
Yeah.

13:22.899 --> 13:25.002
Jugger.

13:26.202 --> 13:29.070
We're all worried about you, man.

13:29.072 --> 13:31.305
What are you doing, Mike? Mike! Mike!

13:31.307 --> 13:33.474
- What are y'all doing? Give me that.
- No, no, no!

13:33.476 --> 13:35.109
It's all right. It's just...

13:35.111 --> 13:37.945
I just...

13:37.947 --> 13:40.449
I don't want to go to sleep.

13:42.186 --> 13:45.052
I heard you sold your
Super Bowl rings, Mike.

13:45.054 --> 13:46.990
Your Super Bowl rings, Mike.

13:53.596 --> 13:56.230
Mike, hey.

13:56.232 --> 13:58.067
Pam's your wife.

13:59.202 --> 14:01.502
- Garrett's your boy.
- Yeah, yeah.

14:05.308 --> 14:07.877
I'm starting to forget things.

14:09.178 --> 14:12.613
I'm saying this crazy crap to my kids.

14:12.615 --> 14:15.585
I nearly pushed Keana into a wall.

14:17.053 --> 14:18.286
I never thought I'd do that to her.

14:18.288 --> 14:19.621
All right, well, don't...

14:19.623 --> 14:21.992
Just don't give up.

14:23.126 --> 14:28.597
All we got to do is finish the game.

14:28.599 --> 14:30.601
We'll all be winners. Okay?

15:24.355 --> 15:26.054
Have a good day. It's good to see you.

15:26.056 --> 15:27.589
Bennet! A moment?

15:27.591 --> 15:30.191
Yes, Father.

15:30.193 --> 15:32.060
- How are you?
- We have a new member.

15:32.062 --> 15:34.396
A young lady from Kenya.

15:34.398 --> 15:37.498
She came to us a couple weeks
ago and she needs our help.

15:37.500 --> 15:38.967
Oh, sure. How much do you need, Father?

15:38.969 --> 15:42.304
She needs shelter, Bennet. Until
we find her something permanent.

15:42.306 --> 15:45.007
Father, I'm working on my MBA.

15:45.009 --> 15:46.507
I'm studying. My books
are all over, everywhere.

15:46.509 --> 15:49.076
She's a nice girl. She's from Nairobi.

15:49.078 --> 15:50.512
Went to British school.

15:50.514 --> 15:52.280
She wants to work.

15:52.282 --> 15:55.117
We're letting her tidy
up around the church.

15:55.119 --> 15:59.220
We're asking you because we know
she'll be safe and cared for.

15:59.222 --> 16:02.089
I feel God in you, Bennet.

16:02.091 --> 16:03.661
Thank you, Father.

16:06.196 --> 16:08.098
Who is she?

16:38.662 --> 16:40.264
So, uh...

16:41.565 --> 16:43.267
You can see.

16:51.174 --> 16:56.046
That is, uh, basically my office, there.

17:03.320 --> 17:05.219
Is that your father?

17:05.221 --> 17:08.556
Ah, yes. The chief.

17:08.558 --> 17:11.159
Um...

17:11.161 --> 17:13.795
Those are my peaches.

17:13.797 --> 17:14.829
They should not be here.

17:16.567 --> 17:18.165
Your room.

17:18.166 --> 17:21.335
Uh, your room. There is a...

17:21.337 --> 17:24.007
The key, I have it for you.

17:25.375 --> 17:27.111
Um...

17:28.310 --> 17:31.246
How are you for... For money?

17:31.248 --> 17:32.983
I have some.

17:36.319 --> 17:38.120
No...

17:38.122 --> 17:41.024
Need is not weak.

17:42.125 --> 17:45.228
Need is need.

17:46.663 --> 17:48.596
I know where you are.

17:48.598 --> 17:50.334
I was you.

17:52.568 --> 17:55.603
You're in America now.

17:55.605 --> 17:59.343
So, you have to be the
best version of yourself.

18:00.477 --> 18:02.177
If you don't know what that is,

18:02.179 --> 18:05.580
you pick something and fake it.

18:05.582 --> 18:07.882
So, I will just...

18:07.884 --> 18:09.817
There, for you.

18:09.819 --> 18:12.153
What did you pick?

18:12.155 --> 18:13.921
- What did I pick?
- To fake.

18:13.923 --> 18:19.227
I picked an older bald-headed white man.

18:19.229 --> 18:21.930
Why an older bald-headed white man?

18:24.268 --> 18:27.371
Because he is the best at what he does.

18:28.771 --> 18:31.141
Do you want to see your room?

18:46.522 --> 18:51.161
I was a registered nurse at the
Aga Khan Hospital in Nairobi.

18:53.363 --> 18:55.630
I understand.

18:55.632 --> 18:58.667
I meant no offense.

19:02.271 --> 19:03.638
Hey!

19:03.640 --> 19:05.606
Hey, wake up!

19:05.608 --> 19:08.343
Hey! Wake up, you.

19:08.345 --> 19:10.679
Come on, now. This ain't no
hotel. You can't sleep here.

19:10.681 --> 19:13.115
Put down your window, let's go!

19:17.587 --> 19:19.821
Wait.

19:19.823 --> 19:21.690
You're Mike Webster, right?

19:21.692 --> 19:24.392
Iron Mike.

19:24.394 --> 19:26.294
<i>I called for him. He's coming.</i>

19:26.296 --> 19:28.265
Okay, but I don't see him.

19:29.432 --> 19:31.632
Oh.

19:31.634 --> 19:33.267
Come on, come on.

19:33.269 --> 19:35.437
Come on, come on.

19:38.442 --> 19:40.574
Oh, what? What is...

19:47.317 --> 19:48.986
Oh, look at that.

19:51.654 --> 19:53.489
Mike, he's here.

19:54.724 --> 19:56.423
Hey, Mike.

19:56.425 --> 19:58.026
- Look, can you, uh...
- Mike, can you hear me?

19:58.028 --> 20:00.728
Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah. You just, uh...

20:00.730 --> 20:03.931
You just have to tell me
what to do, because I am...

20:03.933 --> 20:05.933
I am freaking overwhelmed.

20:05.935 --> 20:07.602
We're gonna get you some help, Mike.

20:07.604 --> 20:09.770
What are you taking right now?

20:09.772 --> 20:11.206
Oh, the Ritalin.

20:11.208 --> 20:13.374
Dexedrine, Prozac, Klonopin,
you're still taking all of those?

20:13.376 --> 20:14.476
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

20:14.478 --> 20:15.744
Come sit down, Mike.

20:15.746 --> 20:17.478
All of it, okay? And superglue.

20:17.480 --> 20:19.546
- Okay.
- Yeah, superglue.

20:19.548 --> 20:22.584
3.5 Haldol. You call his
wife. You tell her he's worse.

20:22.586 --> 20:23.884
He's a lot worse.

20:23.886 --> 20:25.519
You were my doctor. You
were my doctor, right?

20:25.521 --> 20:26.854
I was the team doctor.

20:26.856 --> 20:29.591
Okay! Okay, all right,
then, the team doctor!

20:29.593 --> 20:31.793
All right? The team doctor!

20:31.795 --> 20:33.761
All right? Then why aren't
you helping me, all right?

20:33.763 --> 20:35.896
- I am gonna help you.
- You are not helping me.

20:35.898 --> 20:38.499
You got to fix this! You
got to fix this! All right?

20:38.501 --> 20:40.367
In here, all right?

20:40.369 --> 20:43.938
And in here. I am dying in here!

20:43.940 --> 20:45.472
- I'm dying in here, all right?
- Dr. Bailes.

20:45.474 --> 20:46.908
I hear you, Mike.

20:46.910 --> 20:49.046
It's okay.

20:50.814 --> 20:52.613
Let me give you something
to help you rest, Mike.

20:52.615 --> 20:54.815
You want to rest, don't you?

20:54.817 --> 20:58.753
I just want you to help me, all
right? I just want you to help me.

20:58.755 --> 21:00.020
I will help you, Mike.

21:00.022 --> 21:01.655
Just help me. Just...

21:02.925 --> 21:05.360
- Come and sit down.
- Okay.

21:05.362 --> 21:07.229
Come and sit down.

21:11.934 --> 21:14.035
Well, go ahead, give me the
drugs, give me the drugs.

21:14.037 --> 21:16.403
Show me how you're gonna help me.

21:16.405 --> 21:18.073
- Don't move, Mike.
- Mmm-hmm.

21:18.075 --> 21:20.009
Ow!

21:21.678 --> 21:22.943
Come and sit down, Mike.

21:22.945 --> 21:24.778
Ooh.

21:24.780 --> 21:26.349
Ooh.

21:28.417 --> 21:30.252
- Ooh.
- Come lay down, Mike.

21:34.758 --> 21:37.194
You rest now, Mike.

21:40.797 --> 21:43.064
What am I missing?

21:43.066 --> 21:45.467
- Tumor?
- No.

21:45.469 --> 21:48.036
All of his scans were clean.

22:24.508 --> 22:26.908
<i>Through the years,
the dauntless Webster</i>

22:26.910 --> 22:28.977
<i>had abandoned his
family, slipped into</i>

22:28.979 --> 22:31.712
<i>financial chaos and homelessness.</i>

22:31.714 --> 22:34.915
<i>This is a hard day for the city
of Pittsburgh. On a personal note,</i>

22:34.917 --> 22:36.785
<i>I can remember sitting
down with my father</i>

22:36.787 --> 22:40.054
<i>and him giving me examples
of hard work ethic</i>

22:40.056 --> 22:42.724
<i>and telling me when you get knocked
down, you get back up again.</i>

22:42.726 --> 22:46.594
I'm sorry, uh, I don't usually watch TV.

22:46.596 --> 22:48.763
Then why do you have one?

22:48.765 --> 22:51.601
One has a TV in this country.

23:00.911 --> 23:05.180
Oh, I'm sorry, I don't
usually eat breakfast.

23:05.182 --> 23:08.250
One should eat breakfast in this country.

23:19.462 --> 23:21.830
Dear God,

23:21.832 --> 23:23.565
thank You for the gifts You have

23:23.567 --> 23:25.933
so graciously bestowed upon us.

23:25.935 --> 23:29.504
Please help us to continue to
be deservant of Your blessings.

23:29.506 --> 23:31.206
Amen.

23:31.208 --> 23:32.975
Bennet!

23:32.977 --> 23:35.509
<i>Just hours after he was
rushed to the nearby hospital,</i>

23:35.511 --> 23:37.612
<i>football Hall of Famer,
Iron Mike Webster...</i>

23:37.614 --> 23:38.947
What is going on?

23:38.949 --> 23:40.215
Mike Webster.

23:40.217 --> 23:41.783
Who's Mike Webster?

23:41.785 --> 23:43.218
He's the greatest center
to ever play the game.

23:43.220 --> 23:44.751
He's a true warrior.

23:44.753 --> 23:45.819
Um...

23:45.821 --> 23:47.921
I'm sorry. What is a center?

23:47.923 --> 23:49.524
The big guy in the middle. Hikes it.

23:49.526 --> 23:51.558
My kid plays football because of this guy.

23:51.560 --> 23:53.694
Okay, I'm sorry. I just
did not know who he was.

23:53.696 --> 23:54.895
Well, if you're gonna live in this town,

23:54.897 --> 23:56.898
you gonna work in this town,
football is a good thing.

23:56.900 --> 23:58.932
I freaking can't believe it's you.

23:58.934 --> 24:01.702
Well, as you know, I was put on
the schedule for this weekend.

24:01.704 --> 24:03.705
I am put on the schedule for every weekend.

24:03.707 --> 24:06.710
Come on. Come on.

24:10.579 --> 24:12.980
The whole town was out of work.

24:12.982 --> 24:15.149
He was a guy who gave us hope
when there really was no hope.

24:15.151 --> 24:18.622
Just leave him be.

24:22.592 --> 24:24.726
Look at his teeth.

24:24.728 --> 24:28.598
He was pulling them out and
supergluing them back in.

24:30.634 --> 24:32.901
Gracie, full autopsy, please.

24:32.903 --> 24:35.870
Hey, come on, man. There's no
need to cut this man's body.

24:35.872 --> 24:38.907
Why does an apparently healthy
favorite son of this city

24:38.909 --> 24:42.512
become self-mutilating and homeless at 50?

24:43.747 --> 24:47.215
Cardiac arrest may be
how he died, but not why.

24:47.217 --> 24:48.115
Prepare the body, please.

24:48.117 --> 24:49.752
Yes.

24:55.625 --> 24:58.092
I think what he's saying is that

24:58.094 --> 25:01.763
sometimes in life, you know, you just...

25:01.765 --> 25:04.132
You're asked to leave it alone.

25:04.134 --> 25:06.034
But, uh, sometimes you can't.

25:06.036 --> 25:08.268
Mmm.

25:08.270 --> 25:11.573
Do you believe that he thinks this is
a time that I should leave it alone?

25:11.575 --> 25:14.074
No, I don't.

25:14.076 --> 25:15.309
I never leave it alone.

25:15.311 --> 25:17.746
That's why people hate me.

26:03.159 --> 26:04.794
Mike.

26:06.162 --> 26:10.230
People are saying bad things about you.

26:10.232 --> 26:13.301
I can tell something is wrong.

26:13.303 --> 26:15.937
But I can't do this alone.

26:15.939 --> 26:19.709
I need your help to tell the
world what happened to you.

27:07.257 --> 27:08.858
Hmm.

27:26.009 --> 27:29.443
Oh, uh, sorry. Um...

27:30.814 --> 27:33.948
Regular folds of gray matter.

27:33.950 --> 27:37.017
No obvious contusions.

27:37.019 --> 27:40.789
No shrinkage from Alzheimer's.

27:44.493 --> 27:46.495
What's wrong?

27:49.265 --> 27:52.635
Uh, can you show me the
CT scan again, please?

27:57.807 --> 27:58.940
How old are these?

27:58.942 --> 28:00.807
Mmm, six months.

28:00.809 --> 28:02.746
Six months.

28:17.861 --> 28:20.530
This brain should be a mess.

28:23.298 --> 28:25.634
- But it looks completely normal.
- Mmm.

28:27.836 --> 28:33.474
Records say severe headaches,
double vision, voices in his head.

28:33.476 --> 28:35.776
No documented concussions.

28:35.778 --> 28:37.978
He did complain of dizziness.

28:37.980 --> 28:40.547
- Yes. How often?
- Once.

28:40.549 --> 28:44.518
In 18 years of professional football?

28:44.520 --> 28:46.254
"Joseph Maroon."

28:46.256 --> 28:48.525
Sign the certificate. Sew him up.

28:51.227 --> 28:54.161
Fix the brain, please.

28:54.163 --> 28:57.364
You know we don't have
the budget to do that.

28:57.366 --> 28:59.534
People do not go mad for no reason.

28:59.536 --> 29:00.535
I'm going to continue looking.

29:00.537 --> 29:02.870
No, you're not going to.

29:02.872 --> 29:04.971
Danny, you are out of line.

29:04.973 --> 29:07.275
Hey, you do not speak to me like that!

29:07.277 --> 29:09.242
- I am the pathologist on duty!
- Oh, man.

29:09.244 --> 29:11.112
- I am the pathologist of record!
- Hey! Listen!

29:11.114 --> 29:13.080
This is not your laboratory!

29:13.082 --> 29:15.549
My hands are on this body!
If I am wrong, I am wrong!

29:15.551 --> 29:18.385
- And you are wrong.
- Not you, me!

29:18.387 --> 29:20.587
Fix that brain.

29:20.589 --> 29:23.290
Hey, I am gonna make sure
they don't pay for any of this.

29:23.292 --> 29:26.326
I am going to write my orders
for the tests that I need.

29:26.328 --> 29:27.394
And you're paying for it yourself.

29:27.396 --> 29:28.895
Yes, Danny.

29:28.897 --> 29:31.033
Please, exit my workplace.

29:34.604 --> 29:37.270
Please!

29:37.272 --> 29:40.908
<i>In 25 years, I've never requested
a panel of tests like this.</i>

29:40.910 --> 29:42.476
<i>What are you looking for?</i>

29:42.478 --> 29:47.582
There is not a single
case in a book or in life

29:47.584 --> 29:52.319
where a man that healthy
went that mad that young

29:52.321 --> 29:55.090
with no visible abnormality of the brain.

29:56.925 --> 29:58.926
I don't know what I'm looking for.

29:58.928 --> 30:00.797
I can tell.

30:01.931 --> 30:04.265
It's going to cost you a fortune.

30:04.267 --> 30:06.167
I understand.

30:06.169 --> 30:07.901
Okay.

30:07.903 --> 30:09.937
Well, if you have to play hero,

30:09.939 --> 30:12.508
just make sure we both come out okay.

30:52.414 --> 30:55.917
Dr. Omalu. You got something
today. Left it on your desk.

30:55.919 --> 30:57.450
Oh, thank you.

31:22.545 --> 31:24.147
Prema!

31:25.682 --> 31:28.750
It's very late. Where have you been?

31:32.689 --> 31:35.422
I got a job.

31:35.424 --> 31:37.691
- Look at you.
- Well, uh, a shift.

31:39.328 --> 31:42.330
At a home. Feeding old people.

31:42.332 --> 31:44.968
That is fantastic. Congratulations.

31:46.568 --> 31:49.069
What is that?

31:49.071 --> 31:51.073
Mike Webster.

31:58.315 --> 31:59.546
<i>...phrase is worth $1,000.</i>

31:59.548 --> 32:01.183
<i>And here we go.</i>

32:04.119 --> 32:08.756
Would you like me to get
you a TV for your room?

32:08.758 --> 32:12.593
No. This one will be fine.

32:12.595 --> 32:14.764
Oh, okay.

32:26.375 --> 32:29.209
I can't tell what you're more afraid of.

32:29.211 --> 32:33.613
What you will find, or what you won't.

32:33.615 --> 32:35.117
Hmm.

33:59.769 --> 34:01.804
My God.

34:05.842 --> 34:07.877
My God.

34:32.668 --> 34:33.967
<i>...jacked up from those guys</i>

34:33.969 --> 34:35.768
<i>that are gonna be racing
those sides on this.</i>

34:35.771 --> 34:37.871
<i>Let's get to Jacked Up Number 5.</i>

34:37.873 --> 34:40.708
<i>We're gonna begin with
the Rams and the Chargers.</i>

34:40.710 --> 34:43.610
<i>Mark Bulger gonna be delivering
the ball to Tony Fisher.</i>

34:43.612 --> 34:45.679
<i>Throws it down around his feet.</i>

34:45.681 --> 34:48.614
<i>So, Donnie Edwards is gonna
level him right there.</i>

34:48.617 --> 34:51.351
<i>Always be looking out for
the big hit right there.</i>

34:51.353 --> 34:54.655
<i>- Tony Fisher got jacked up!
- Jacked up!</i>

34:54.657 --> 34:57.557
<i>Number 4, the Seahawks
and the Chiefs.</i>

34:57.559 --> 34:59.760
<i>D.J. Hackett is gonna make the catch</i>

34:59.762 --> 35:02.229
<i>and Ty Law will
launch him backwards.</i>

35:02.231 --> 35:04.699
<i>How far backwards?</i>

35:04.701 --> 35:08.401
<i>Eyes on me! Eyes on me! Gentlemen!</i>

35:08.403 --> 35:11.237
This is a game of awareness.

35:11.239 --> 35:14.641
It is a game of desire. That's why
we have the three-whistle drill.

35:14.643 --> 35:16.510
Let's go!

35:16.512 --> 35:18.646
<i>When I blow this
whistle three times,</i>

35:18.648 --> 35:21.248
<i>you seek out a
teammate. Any teammate.</i>

35:21.250 --> 35:24.684
You make collision, you be
physical, you be violent!

35:24.686 --> 35:26.286
Bring it in here, let's go! Bring it in!

35:29.759 --> 35:32.392
<i>The only way you're gonna get
this player's hands off you,</i>

35:32.394 --> 35:34.561
you grab him by the throat and you squeeze!

35:34.563 --> 35:39.200
You choke him until shit runs
down his leg! Do you understand me?

35:39.202 --> 35:40.202
- Oh!
- Ooh, ooh, wow.

35:50.980 --> 35:52.679
Let's go! Let's go!

35:53.949 --> 35:55.916
Drive! Drive! Hit him!

35:55.918 --> 35:58.851
Hit it! Drive! Drive!

35:58.853 --> 36:01.287
<i>The Jaguars and the
Eagles. Dirk Johnson.</i>

36:01.289 --> 36:03.958
<i>And I'm gonna wait for this
because the look on his face</i>

36:03.960 --> 36:06.293
<i>- tells you that he got jacked up!
- Jacked up!</i>

36:12.434 --> 36:15.235
<i>And our Number 1 hit of the week,</i>

36:15.237 --> 36:17.804
<i>Jon Kitna dropping back the pass,</i>

36:17.806 --> 36:22.709
<i>and Shawntae Spencer
lifts him off his feet!</i>

36:22.711 --> 36:27.149
<i>- Oh, my God! And Jon Kitna got jacked up!
- Jacked up!</i>

36:49.938 --> 36:52.373
You should see this, Bennet.

36:55.577 --> 36:58.979
It's actually really beautiful.

36:58.981 --> 37:01.914
<i>Priest Holmes, he's diving.
Yes, he's got it! Touchdown!</i>

37:01.916 --> 37:04.452
<i>Oh, tremendous! Tremendous catch!</i>

37:07.289 --> 37:09.423
I want to show you something.

37:09.425 --> 37:11.659
A human brain

37:11.661 --> 37:16.299
sits in a fluid completely
disconnected from the human skull.

37:52.668 --> 37:56.238
Bennet, will you relax?
I can hear you breathing.

38:05.681 --> 38:08.451
This is a really terrible brain.

38:10.552 --> 38:12.452
Ever met the great DeKosky before?

38:12.454 --> 38:15.024
Expect two minutes, tops.

38:16.358 --> 38:18.124
Is that him?

38:18.126 --> 38:20.129
So, you're our prize graduate.

38:39.981 --> 38:41.782
Tell him.

38:41.784 --> 38:44.150
It's Mike Webster.

38:44.152 --> 38:45.452
The Pittsburgh...

38:45.454 --> 38:46.987
I know who Mike Webster is.

38:46.989 --> 38:48.454
Steve.

38:48.456 --> 38:50.359
He was 50.

39:05.474 --> 39:07.141
You have my attention.

39:14.483 --> 39:15.883
The Cape gannet.

39:15.885 --> 39:21.188
A diving bird capable of generating
speeds of up to 75 miles per hour,

39:21.190 --> 39:25.261
turning itself into a missile as it
collides with the face of the sea.

39:27.163 --> 39:30.998
The red-head woodpecker can
absorb a G-force of 1,000,

39:31.000 --> 39:34.501
pecking a tree 12,000 times per day,

39:34.503 --> 39:37.440
85 million times over its lifetime.

39:41.443 --> 39:43.577
Bighorn sheep can generate...

39:43.579 --> 39:45.281
- Bennet.
- Hmm?

39:46.614 --> 39:49.350
Okay, okay.

39:50.885 --> 39:54.987
All of these animals have shock
absorbers built into their bodies.

39:54.989 --> 39:56.956
The woodpecker's tongue extends through

39:56.958 --> 39:58.592
the back of the mouth out of the nostril,

39:58.594 --> 40:00.927
encircling the entire cranium.

40:00.929 --> 40:03.530
It is the anatomical equivalent

40:03.532 --> 40:05.865
of a safety belt for its brain.

40:05.867 --> 40:07.867
Human beings?

40:07.869 --> 40:10.838
Not a single piece of our anatomy

40:10.840 --> 40:13.673
protects us from those types of collisions.

40:13.675 --> 40:17.911
A human being will get concussed at 60 G's.

40:17.913 --> 40:22.081
A common head-to-head
contact on a football field?

40:22.083 --> 40:24.652
One hundred G's.

40:26.222 --> 40:29.956
God did not intend for us to play football.

40:29.958 --> 40:33.494
Let's keep God out of this.

40:33.496 --> 40:35.695
Okay.

40:35.697 --> 40:38.166
Um, okay. Look.

40:44.239 --> 40:45.639
What are the S's?

40:45.641 --> 40:47.941
Uh, the Steelers.

40:47.943 --> 40:50.244
- And the O's?
- The others, obviously.

40:50.246 --> 40:51.711
Yes, the other team.

40:51.713 --> 40:53.646
Do you even watch football?

40:53.648 --> 40:55.282
Uh, no, not at all.

40:55.284 --> 40:58.017
But I've been studying
Mike Webster's position.

40:58.019 --> 41:00.686
The man in the middle is quite deceptively

41:00.688 --> 41:02.856
the most violent position on the field.

41:02.858 --> 41:05.157
The slaps, the punches, the forearm.

41:05.159 --> 41:08.729
It is an unremitting storm
of sub-concussive blows.

41:08.731 --> 41:12.733
The head as a weapon on every
single play of every single game

41:12.735 --> 41:14.267
of every single practice, from the time

41:14.269 --> 41:17.271
he was a little boy to a college man,

41:17.273 --> 41:21.541
culminating in an 18-year
professional career.

41:21.543 --> 41:23.276
By my calculations,

41:23.278 --> 41:25.679
Mike Webster sustained

41:25.681 --> 41:29.484
more than 70,000 blows to his head.

41:31.052 --> 41:34.021
Now, now, these men, these men,

41:34.023 --> 41:36.757
these are the fastest.

41:36.759 --> 41:40.726
Now, their speed multiplied by
the speed of the men who hit them,

41:40.728 --> 41:42.896
the G-forces generated

41:42.898 --> 41:47.034
equivalent to hitting them on
the helmet with a sledgehammer.

41:47.036 --> 41:49.235
All of this

41:49.237 --> 41:52.639
triggered a cascading
series of neurological events

41:52.641 --> 41:54.340
which unleashed killer proteins

41:54.342 --> 41:58.177
upon Mike Webster's brain,

41:58.179 --> 42:04.184
the tangles invading and strangling
his mind from the inside out.

42:04.186 --> 42:08.789
Like pouring wet concrete
down kitchen pipes.

42:08.791 --> 42:13.796
As it hardens, it chokes the
brain, leaving him unrecognizable,

42:15.197 --> 42:17.466
even to himself.

42:18.701 --> 42:22.735
I don't know football. I've never played.

42:22.737 --> 42:28.309
But I am telling you that playing
football killed Mike Webster.

42:29.378 --> 42:31.945
And I am certain that there are others.

42:31.947 --> 42:34.313
And how can you possibly know that?

42:34.315 --> 42:36.249
Common sense.

42:36.251 --> 42:38.050
But they are either dead or lost

42:38.052 --> 42:39.820
in the way that Mike Webster was lost.

42:39.822 --> 42:42.188
I'm not interested in common sense.

42:42.190 --> 42:44.324
I'm interested in science.

42:44.326 --> 42:46.659
And science is knowing.

42:46.661 --> 42:49.329
I know from these players' records

42:49.331 --> 42:52.766
that their doctors believe
they have early Alzheimer's,

42:52.768 --> 42:55.334
which is statistically impossible.

42:55.336 --> 42:57.970
They're too young.

42:57.972 --> 43:01.240
Because it's not Alzheimer's.

43:01.242 --> 43:02.877
It is this.

43:24.400 --> 43:26.999
I don't like it.

43:27.001 --> 43:28.434
No.

43:28.436 --> 43:31.438
No, actually, I hate it.

43:31.440 --> 43:33.776
But as a scientist,

43:35.811 --> 43:37.846
I can't deny it.

43:38.880 --> 43:42.317
Name it. You have to give this a name.

44:07.710 --> 44:11.010
Oh, I'm sorry. Did I wake you?

44:11.012 --> 44:14.380
Did they agree what it is?

44:14.382 --> 44:16.450
Oh.

44:16.452 --> 44:20.086
Yes, yes. We are going to publish.

44:20.088 --> 44:21.822
They...

44:21.824 --> 44:24.324
- With you?
- Yes.

44:24.326 --> 44:27.159
In a medical journal.

44:27.161 --> 44:28.795
With you?

44:28.797 --> 44:32.199
Yes, with me. Together.

44:32.201 --> 44:34.435
That's so...

44:36.371 --> 44:39.072
Congratulations.

44:39.074 --> 44:41.410
Thank you. Thank you.

44:44.179 --> 44:46.912
Uh, you, um...

44:46.914 --> 44:49.449
Are you going somewhere?

44:49.451 --> 44:51.383
Yes.

44:51.385 --> 44:53.987
With you.

44:53.989 --> 44:55.421
To celebrate.

45:11.940 --> 45:14.340
You don't dance, do you?

46:56.077 --> 47:00.082
I had quite a revelation tonight.

47:02.650 --> 47:05.918
This body was made for dancing.

47:05.920 --> 47:08.621
When they say "dancing
machine," I am what they mean.

47:10.626 --> 47:13.962
I'm very proud of you.

47:17.632 --> 47:18.999
Okay.

47:43.659 --> 47:46.458
May I kiss you?

48:32.708 --> 48:34.974
- Good morning.
- Cyril.

48:34.976 --> 48:37.978
It's very weird to bring
women into the morgue at night.

48:37.980 --> 48:39.045
She is a friend.

48:39.047 --> 48:41.581
You don't have friends.

48:41.583 --> 48:43.615
Listen, Danny knows she's been in there.

48:43.617 --> 48:45.385
He's thinking about
filing a formal complaint.

48:45.387 --> 48:47.320
What?

48:47.322 --> 48:49.222
I was working on Webster.

48:49.224 --> 48:51.191
I know. I'll take care of it.

48:51.193 --> 48:54.226
How much has that cost you so far?

48:54.228 --> 48:55.295
$20,000.

48:55.297 --> 48:56.729
Twenty?

48:56.731 --> 48:59.032
I save.

48:59.034 --> 49:02.004
- Everything.
- Really? How un-American.

49:03.204 --> 49:05.438
Well, maybe it was worth it.

49:05.440 --> 49:07.307
I got the call.

49:07.309 --> 49:09.775
Chronic traumatic encephalopathy.

49:09.777 --> 49:11.344
Got a nice ring to it, doesn't it?

49:11.346 --> 49:13.213
Yes. CTE.

49:13.215 --> 49:15.215
So, what happens now?

49:15.217 --> 49:19.084
We publish. Uh, DeKosky
is going to coauthor.

49:19.086 --> 49:20.487
- DeKosky?
- Yes.

49:20.489 --> 49:25.624
Omalu, DeKosky and Cyril Wecht.

49:25.626 --> 49:27.194
Oh.

49:28.295 --> 49:30.764
Well, I'm very proud of you.

49:30.766 --> 49:33.199
Thank you.

49:33.201 --> 49:35.367
See? The gray's the right color.

49:35.369 --> 49:37.604
The blue shows the dirt, even in the rain.

49:37.606 --> 49:39.808
Here you go.

49:46.681 --> 49:48.648
Let's go, baby!

49:49.818 --> 49:52.117
Come on, get it, get it, get it!

49:52.119 --> 49:55.487
<i>And watch the play-action.
The safeties jump up.</i>

49:55.489 --> 49:57.389
<i>And look at that touch
by Ben Roethlisberger.</i>

49:57.391 --> 50:00.159
<i>And Plaxico Burress
does a great job.</i>

50:00.161 --> 50:00.793
<i>Looked like he tripped...</i>

50:00.795 --> 50:03.530
You may not!

50:03.532 --> 50:06.766
I say not to, but he does.

50:06.768 --> 50:10.670
<i>Roethlisberger scrambling
out of the pocket.</i>

50:10.672 --> 50:13.072
<i>Throwing across the middle! Caught!</i>

50:13.074 --> 50:15.641
<i>Burress at the 45!</i>

50:17.144 --> 50:19.281
<i>And if you don't know, Plaxico!</i>

50:22.617 --> 50:26.755
<i>Yeah. That was a pressure
toss by the rook.</i>

50:28.722 --> 50:30.789
- I'm hearing voices.
- Are you serious?

50:30.791 --> 50:33.126
- They're just talking.
- Stop. Justin, stop. You're scaring me.

50:33.128 --> 50:34.461
You're scaring them.

50:34.463 --> 50:35.528
Look at me!

50:37.099 --> 50:38.530
They're telling me to kill you.

50:38.532 --> 50:40.733
They're telling me to kill you!

50:43.304 --> 50:45.804
Get out! Get out!

50:45.806 --> 50:47.875
Get out!

50:58.619 --> 50:59.686
No!

51:02.657 --> 51:04.590
No!

51:04.592 --> 51:06.159
<i>All units, black pickup</i>

51:06.161 --> 51:07.561
<i>spotted on thruway eight miles...</i>

51:07.563 --> 51:09.862
<i>Okay, I see him. Just
passing me. Where am I?</i>

51:09.864 --> 51:12.764
<i>Reportedly driving into
opposite traffic last 10 miles.</i>

51:12.766 --> 51:14.434
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

51:14.436 --> 51:16.269
<i>Pickup has collided.</i>

51:16.271 --> 51:18.140
<i>All units. Reported collision.</i>

51:36.557 --> 51:39.525
<i>A few months after Steeler
favorite Justin Strzelczyk</i>

51:39.527 --> 51:42.228
<i>was killed in that fiery accident,</i>

51:42.230 --> 51:44.831
<i>yet another Steeler
favorite, Terry Long,</i>

51:44.833 --> 51:47.733
<i>has apparently committed
suicide at the age of 45.</i>

51:47.735 --> 51:49.568
Oh, Terry.

51:49.570 --> 51:52.207
You wonder where they are now? Now we know.

51:54.476 --> 51:56.575
Terry Long, Pittsburgh Steelers.

51:56.577 --> 51:59.778
I guess these guys only
die when you're working.

51:59.780 --> 52:01.380
What other problems did he have?

52:01.382 --> 52:03.282
Arrested a few times.

52:03.284 --> 52:05.918
Fraud, federal theft.

52:05.920 --> 52:07.619
Wow, arrested a lot.

52:07.621 --> 52:09.322
I need a full autopsy.

52:09.324 --> 52:10.822
Same tests as Mike Webster.

52:10.824 --> 52:12.458
You're paying for that, too?

52:12.460 --> 52:15.163
Yes, Danny, I'm paying for that, too.

52:20.335 --> 52:22.404
Joseph Maroon.

53:19.327 --> 53:21.029
<i>This is my dream.</i>

53:24.398 --> 53:26.901
The schools are good.

53:28.369 --> 53:30.437
You are good, Prema.

53:33.907 --> 53:36.377
I'm sure you see good in me.

53:37.746 --> 53:41.216
I see all that you are.

53:43.885 --> 53:46.187
I want to marry you.

53:48.856 --> 53:51.125
We can fall in love.

53:57.965 --> 54:01.367
If you want to marry me,

54:01.369 --> 54:04.005
I will marry you.

54:05.572 --> 54:08.508
That is good, because I
already made the down payment.

54:13.481 --> 54:17.953
I saved all my money and
I bought this for you.

54:57.092 --> 54:59.460
Get me Elliot Pellman.

55:15.076 --> 55:17.844
<i>I have Chris Jones for you.</i>

55:17.846 --> 55:19.314
I'm just looking at it.

55:20.581 --> 55:22.749
Anything to be concerned about?

55:22.751 --> 55:25.985
<i>This Omalu, he's a
coroner in Pittsburgh.</i>

55:25.987 --> 55:28.755
He looks like a nobody,
but let me get into it.

55:28.757 --> 55:30.424
All right.

55:48.576 --> 55:51.144
- Hello? <i>
- Is Bennet Omalu there?</i>

55:51.146 --> 55:53.713
Uh, yes, he is.

55:53.715 --> 55:55.548
Okay.

55:55.550 --> 55:57.150
Yes.

55:57.152 --> 55:59.452
<i>I'm a neurologist who's worked
around football for years.</i>

55:59.454 --> 56:02.155
<i>Very familiar with the
NFL's concussion research.</i>

56:02.157 --> 56:03.755
<i>And the League
concluded unequivocally</i>

56:03.757 --> 56:07.126
<i>that football players
do not get brain damage.</i>

56:07.128 --> 56:09.929
<i>Webster is one random
case, Mr. Omalu.</i>

56:09.931 --> 56:11.764
Dr. Omalu.

56:11.766 --> 56:14.867
<i>Well, whatever. You're an uneducated
quack and your career is over.</i>

56:18.472 --> 56:20.539
<i>They said you were uneducated?</i>

56:20.541 --> 56:23.008
Did they even read your resume?

56:23.010 --> 56:25.110
Well, I got calls, too.

56:25.112 --> 56:28.213
Apparently, the National
Football League owns neuroscience.

56:28.215 --> 56:29.816
Who knew?

56:29.818 --> 56:31.650
"Failure to find."

56:31.652 --> 56:34.519
"Absence of clinical information."

56:34.521 --> 56:36.789
- What do they want?
- Your head on a spike.

56:36.791 --> 56:39.025
They want you to retract your findings.

56:39.027 --> 56:41.696
They want you to say you made it all up.

56:43.465 --> 56:46.199
- I made it up?
- They're accusing you of fraud.

56:46.201 --> 56:50.138
If you retract, you'll be
fine. This all goes away.

56:51.639 --> 56:52.771
Why... Why are they doing this?

56:52.773 --> 56:54.740
They're terrified of you.

56:54.742 --> 56:56.876
What did you think they
were gonna say? "Thank you"?

56:56.878 --> 56:58.010
Yes.

56:58.012 --> 56:59.211
What the hell for?

56:59.213 --> 57:00.979
For being told.

57:00.981 --> 57:02.683
For knowing.

57:03.952 --> 57:05.985
Oh, I understand.

57:05.987 --> 57:08.422
You think you're being a good American.

57:10.891 --> 57:15.695
So, the city of Pittsburgh
spent $233 million

57:15.697 --> 57:19.798
to build their glorious
Steelers a new stadium.

57:19.800 --> 57:25.104
All the while, they were closing
schools and raising taxes.

57:25.106 --> 57:28.641
These people are not
out to change the world.

57:28.643 --> 57:32.912
And this is not some
quaint academic discovery

57:32.914 --> 57:36.849
stuck in the back of an
obscure medical journal.

57:36.851 --> 57:41.253
Bennet Omalu is going
to war with a corporation

57:41.255 --> 57:46.092
that has 20 million people, on a
weekly basis, craving their product,

57:46.094 --> 57:48.260
the same way they crave food.

57:49.764 --> 57:53.666
The NFL owns a day of the week.

57:53.668 --> 57:56.135
The same day the church used to own.

57:56.137 --> 57:58.170
Now it's theirs.

57:58.172 --> 58:00.408
They're very big.

58:14.222 --> 58:16.324
Terry Long.

58:18.259 --> 58:21.760
The tests came back positive.

58:21.762 --> 58:27.266
Football gave him CTE,
and CTE told his brain

58:27.268 --> 58:31.672
to drink a gallon of
antifreeze, and he died.

58:32.773 --> 58:34.676
I told you there would be more.

58:35.876 --> 58:38.610
You have done great work.

58:38.612 --> 58:41.246
No one would blame you if you stopped now.

58:41.248 --> 58:43.684
Oh, no one is stopping anything.

58:45.052 --> 58:47.186
Then I'd be lying if I didn't tell you

58:47.188 --> 58:49.690
how important your next move is.

58:57.664 --> 59:00.333
By the time Terry Long committed suicide,

59:00.335 --> 59:05.204
his brain had been consumed by
chronic traumatic encephalopathy.

59:05.206 --> 59:09.175
<i>And it is probable,
perhaps even likely,</i>

59:09.177 --> 59:11.276
<i>that a larger percentage of
professional football players</i>

59:11.278 --> 59:13.945
<i>have and will die from CTE.</i>

59:13.947 --> 59:15.780
<i>This was the Pittsburgh
Medical Examiner's</i>

59:15.782 --> 59:18.316
<i>own Dr. Bennet Omalu,</i>

59:18.318 --> 59:21.086
<i>who today threw down the gauntlet at the
feet of the National Football League.</i>

59:21.088 --> 59:22.354
Thank you.

59:25.793 --> 59:27.325
What do you think?

59:27.327 --> 59:29.663
I think you're gonna be an American hero.

59:30.831 --> 59:32.097
I'm not even an American.

59:32.099 --> 59:33.699
That's even better.

59:33.701 --> 59:35.703
That's so fucking American.

59:40.041 --> 59:43.742
"Dr. Maroon, who is also vice-chairman of

59:43.744 --> 59:47.079
"the neurosurgery department at the
University of Pittsburgh Medical Center,

59:47.081 --> 59:53.952
"said of Omalu's CTE diagnosis
that it was fallacious reasoning."

01:00:01.128 --> 01:00:02.894
Yes.

01:00:02.896 --> 01:00:04.329
<i>Yeah, is this Bennet Omalu?</i>

01:00:04.331 --> 01:00:06.731
Dr. Bennet Omalu.

01:00:06.733 --> 01:00:10.269
<i>You want to pussify this country?
You want to vaginize football?</i>

01:00:10.271 --> 01:00:13.675
<i>Get the hell out. Or they'll
be doing your autopsy.</i>

01:01:08.929 --> 01:01:10.396
<i>Dr. Omalu?</i>

01:01:10.398 --> 01:01:12.465
Yes.

01:01:12.467 --> 01:01:14.200
<i>I took you to be an early riser.</i>

01:01:14.202 --> 01:01:15.900
<i>I didn't want to call
you at your office.</i>

01:01:15.902 --> 01:01:19.405
<i>This is Julian Bailes.</i>

01:01:19.407 --> 01:01:20.940
<i>Do you know who I am?</i>

01:01:20.942 --> 01:01:24.142
I know who you are.

01:01:24.144 --> 01:01:27.479
Mike Webster was a personal friend.

01:01:27.481 --> 01:01:28.947
Was he?

01:01:28.949 --> 01:01:30.483
<i>Dr. Omalu.</i>

01:01:31.853 --> 01:01:35.253
You're in trouble, but you're not wrong.

01:01:35.255 --> 01:01:37.658
I'd like to talk with you.

01:02:07.954 --> 01:02:11.322
The NFL has known about this
concussion crisis for years.

01:02:11.324 --> 01:02:14.126
And what you have there is the research

01:02:14.128 --> 01:02:17.229
that forms the basis for the
League's concussion guidelines.

01:02:17.231 --> 01:02:19.398
In this study,

01:02:19.400 --> 01:02:23.369
some academics put helmets on
monkeys and shook them real hard.

01:02:23.371 --> 01:02:28.039
They threw dogs and pigs and human
cadavers down elevator shafts.

01:02:28.041 --> 01:02:30.842
Helmets on crash-test dummies
and bashed them together.

01:02:30.844 --> 01:02:32.747
And their conclusion?

01:02:36.150 --> 01:02:40.119
"No striking player experienced
neck injury or concussion."

01:02:40.121 --> 01:02:44.023
So, a concussion's no more
dangerous than a hangnail.

01:02:44.025 --> 01:02:46.157
- And that was it?
- Oh, no, no, no.

01:02:46.159 --> 01:02:49.094
The NFL did what every organization does.

01:02:49.096 --> 01:02:51.563
They put together a
commission to study the study.

01:02:51.565 --> 01:02:55.266
Dr. Elliot Pellman's Mild
Traumatic Brain Injury Committee.

01:02:55.268 --> 01:02:57.168
You know who else was on that committee?

01:02:57.170 --> 01:02:59.371
- Dr. Maroon.
- Joe, yeah, he was on there.

01:02:59.373 --> 01:03:03.041
Plus a couple of other team doctors,

01:03:03.043 --> 01:03:06.612
an equipment manager and two trainers,

01:03:06.614 --> 01:03:08.546
guys who tape knees for a living.

01:03:08.548 --> 01:03:10.884
I mean...

01:03:22.896 --> 01:03:25.065
Why am I here, Dr. Bailes?

01:03:26.199 --> 01:03:30.302
Doctor, I'm not with the Steelers anymore.

01:03:30.304 --> 01:03:32.873
I'm not with the NFL.

01:03:33.907 --> 01:03:38.244
Now, do you know how many Pittsburgh
Steelers, just Steelers, now,

01:03:38.246 --> 01:03:41.347
have died in the last few years?

01:03:41.349 --> 01:03:43.215
And I'm not talking about the older guys.

01:03:43.217 --> 01:03:44.983
I'm talking about men that I worked with,

01:03:44.985 --> 01:03:47.653
and just the ones that I know about.

01:03:47.655 --> 01:03:49.757
Twelve.

01:03:51.458 --> 01:03:53.492
And I don't want to see

01:03:53.494 --> 01:03:57.832
any more of these men vanish
in the back of a pickup truck.

01:04:09.409 --> 01:04:11.510
<i>I know them.</i>

01:04:11.512 --> 01:04:14.112
I was them.

01:04:14.114 --> 01:04:16.081
And I think you're doing this wrong.

01:04:16.083 --> 01:04:19.918
As long as the NFL continues to
deny the truth, nothing changes.

01:04:19.920 --> 01:04:22.054
It's only true if they say it's true.

01:04:22.056 --> 01:04:24.690
And they've got to say it out loud.

01:04:24.692 --> 01:04:27.092
Get me a meeting with the Commissioner.

01:04:27.094 --> 01:04:28.994
I want to sit with him, man to man,

01:04:28.996 --> 01:04:31.697
face to face. I will
make him say it out loud.

01:04:31.699 --> 01:04:34.499
They don't want to talk to you.

01:04:34.501 --> 01:04:38.403
Football does not want to talk to you.

01:04:38.405 --> 01:04:40.940
Like my daddy, a Louisiana
judge, always used to say to me,

01:04:40.942 --> 01:04:45.510
"Son, God is number one
and football is number two."

01:04:47.547 --> 01:04:50.081
Besides, to them you're not even American.

01:04:50.083 --> 01:04:52.550
You're not even African-American.

01:04:52.552 --> 01:04:54.622
You're...

01:04:55.690 --> 01:04:57.155
A doctor?

01:05:01.728 --> 01:05:04.630
Okay.

01:05:04.632 --> 01:05:06.432
Look.

01:05:06.434 --> 01:05:10.001
The League has kept everyone in the dark.

01:05:10.003 --> 01:05:13.972
And you turned on the lights and
gave their biggest boogeyman a name.

01:05:13.974 --> 01:05:16.175
What's happening now, what you think

01:05:16.177 --> 01:05:18.712
they're doing to you, that's nothing.

01:05:20.581 --> 01:05:25.717
I've done my own research on
this NFL Brain Injury Committee.

01:05:25.719 --> 01:05:28.619
You know what Dr. Elliot Pellman is?

01:05:28.621 --> 01:05:30.456
He's a rheumatologist.

01:05:30.458 --> 01:05:33.525
He's a specialist in
arthritis and joint pain.

01:05:33.527 --> 01:05:36.327
Can you tell me what a rheumatologist

01:05:36.329 --> 01:05:38.899
knows about the brain and brain disease?

01:05:40.067 --> 01:05:45.637
Corporate men like this, in this
country, usually go to Harvard or Yale.

01:05:45.639 --> 01:05:49.708
He went to medical school in Guadalajara.

01:05:49.710 --> 01:05:51.342
- Mexico?
- Yes.

01:05:51.344 --> 01:05:54.247
I did not know that.

01:05:55.583 --> 01:05:57.250
That's beautiful.

01:06:01.722 --> 01:06:06.090
Now, two cases does not meet
the scientific burden of proof.

01:06:06.092 --> 01:06:07.928
You have to keep going.

01:06:09.463 --> 01:06:14.233
Just so you understand, this
does not show up on a CT scan.

01:06:14.235 --> 01:06:17.436
Which means there's no
diagnosis before death.

01:06:17.438 --> 01:06:21.373
In order for me to keep
going, more have to die.

01:06:21.375 --> 01:06:24.210
Unfortunately, that's already happening.

01:07:06.820 --> 01:07:08.619
Double D.

01:07:08.621 --> 01:07:10.555
Did I hear right? We're losing you?

01:07:10.557 --> 01:07:12.691
Tapping you for mayor of Chicago?

01:07:12.693 --> 01:07:14.860
Still a long, long road, my friend.

01:07:14.862 --> 01:07:19.630
All-world killer athlete to civilian
to king, all in one lifetime.

01:07:19.632 --> 01:07:23.267
Ladies and gentlemen, I give
you Mayor Dave Duerson...

01:07:23.269 --> 01:07:25.670
...who has figured it out.

01:07:30.143 --> 01:07:31.342
- Dave!
- Yeah.

01:07:31.344 --> 01:07:33.512
It's me, man. Andre Waters.

01:07:33.514 --> 01:07:35.313
How you doing, man?

01:07:35.315 --> 01:07:37.218
Look, let me walk with you.

01:07:38.652 --> 01:07:41.720
This is not good, Dave, not
good. It's in the paperwork.

01:07:41.722 --> 01:07:44.822
But, um, why is the
committee doing this, man?

01:07:44.824 --> 01:07:47.291
There are five other
trustees. You talk to them?

01:07:47.293 --> 01:07:48.793
You're the only one who played, man.

01:07:48.795 --> 01:07:50.729
You the only one who
knows what it is to be us.

01:07:50.731 --> 01:07:53.865
Hey, hey, hey. You and me,
we were the same, man, huh?

01:07:53.867 --> 01:07:55.601
We were bangers, hitmen.

01:07:55.603 --> 01:07:58.403
File the appeal.

01:07:58.405 --> 01:08:01.373
You denied the appeal, Dave! Look,
something's wrong with me, man.

01:08:01.375 --> 01:08:02.740
I can't sleep. Okay...

01:08:02.742 --> 01:08:05.244
I mean, my eyes get crossed.
It just weirds me out.

01:08:05.246 --> 01:08:07.311
- Hey, hey! Look at me!
- Jesus!

01:08:07.313 --> 01:08:09.514
Look. Twelve years I paid my dues.

01:08:09.516 --> 01:08:11.450
I made millions for those assholes.

01:08:11.452 --> 01:08:13.619
I mean, come on. It's
not even your money, man.

01:08:13.621 --> 01:08:16.755
I'm just asking back what I gave!

01:08:16.756 --> 01:08:20.291
Listen. Fat? Stop eating like a
pig. Got a headache? See a doctor.

01:08:20.292 --> 01:08:23.694
I've seen 20 doctors!
I just need rent money.

01:08:23.697 --> 01:08:26.397
Get your shit together!

01:08:26.399 --> 01:08:28.399
You used to be a warrior.

01:08:28.402 --> 01:08:30.902
- You fucking sellout.
- Get your hands off me!

01:08:30.904 --> 01:08:33.237
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
Dave. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

01:08:33.238 --> 01:08:34.872
Look, hey, hey, hey.

01:08:34.875 --> 01:08:38.242
Remember when we were kids?
Remember when we were kids?

01:08:38.243 --> 01:08:41.212
Playing's what we lived for. Huh?

01:08:41.215 --> 01:08:44.251
I need your help. I need your help, Dave.

01:08:47.787 --> 01:08:49.956
Dave, help me!

01:09:00.667 --> 01:09:03.402
"Andre Waters, known as 'Dirty Waters, '

01:09:03.404 --> 01:09:05.870
"notorious for his aggressive style of play

01:09:05.872 --> 01:09:10.442
<i>"and devastating hits that
filled highlight reels.</i>

01:09:10.444 --> 01:09:13.844
<i>"Waters died of a self-inflicted
gunshot wound to the head.</i>

01:09:13.845 --> 01:09:16.082
"He was 44."

01:09:20.819 --> 01:09:27.893
And, uh, this is the part
where he, uh, got knocked out.

01:09:27.895 --> 01:09:30.795
<i>Andre Waters has
it. We'll be back...</i>

01:09:30.796 --> 01:09:33.298
He said he was all right.

01:09:33.300 --> 01:09:37.171
Said he was just a little dazed,
but he said he was all right.

01:09:39.974 --> 01:09:42.176
You look well.

01:09:43.777 --> 01:09:44.843
How are the kids?

01:09:44.845 --> 01:09:46.447
Kids are fine.

01:09:47.581 --> 01:09:49.283
I'm fine.

01:09:52.286 --> 01:09:54.955
I'm sorry I couldn't
make it to the funeral.

01:09:56.323 --> 01:09:59.891
No one made it to the funeral.

01:09:59.893 --> 01:10:01.994
<i>He was the sun.</i>

01:10:01.996 --> 01:10:05.696
We was the planets.

01:10:05.698 --> 01:10:10.370
And then, after he gave
me this card, he said, "Ma,

01:10:14.875 --> 01:10:17.608
"I'm ready to go."

01:10:17.610 --> 01:10:21.946
Because he knew people
was thinking he was crazy.

01:10:21.948 --> 01:10:24.883
Not crazy.

01:10:24.885 --> 01:10:28.286
He'd already become someone else.

01:10:28.288 --> 01:10:32.391
You definitely think he had this disease?

01:10:32.393 --> 01:10:35.027
Because I want to believe that.

01:10:35.029 --> 01:10:37.331
I believe so, yes.

01:10:38.532 --> 01:10:43.002
And now you want what's left of my boy.

01:10:45.038 --> 01:10:47.107
You heard about Mike Webster?

01:10:49.810 --> 01:10:52.576
And Terry Long and...

01:10:52.578 --> 01:10:53.911
And...

01:10:53.913 --> 01:10:56.049
And who else?

01:10:59.853 --> 01:11:03.189
What do you really want to ask me, Julian?

01:11:30.751 --> 01:11:34.288
Dr. Cyril Wecht, Dr. Julian Bailes.

01:11:35.555 --> 01:11:37.390
- Pleasure to meet you.
- Mmm-hmm.

01:11:42.796 --> 01:11:44.998
Andre Waters.

01:11:53.439 --> 01:11:55.441
Justin Strzelczyk.

01:12:08.421 --> 01:12:10.755
I just kept sending them back out there.

01:12:10.757 --> 01:12:14.058
What the hell were you thinking?

01:12:14.060 --> 01:12:15.893
You've got to be a part of it.

01:12:15.895 --> 01:12:20.699
You've got to be on the
sidelines with them to understand.

01:12:20.701 --> 01:12:24.769
Whatever it takes to keep them in the
game, to keep the whole thing going.

01:12:24.771 --> 01:12:29.141
Tape, needles, Vicodin, Toradol, Lidocaine,

01:12:29.143 --> 01:12:32.613
Percocet, Lexapro, Zoloft.

01:12:34.515 --> 01:12:36.615
- Have I left anything out?
- Mmm.

01:12:36.617 --> 01:12:39.084
It's tires and oil.

01:12:39.086 --> 01:12:41.786
Just mechanics trying to keep
the cars on the racetrack.

01:12:41.788 --> 01:12:45.891
Yeah, well, it's not medicine.
I don't know what it is.

01:12:45.893 --> 01:12:48.994
It's business.

01:12:48.996 --> 01:12:50.495
Oh.

01:12:50.497 --> 01:12:52.930
- There you go.
- Okay, okay.

01:12:52.932 --> 01:12:56.634
Three cases is the
scientific burden of evidence.

01:12:56.636 --> 01:12:58.570
We have four.

01:12:58.572 --> 01:13:01.639
That is far beyond anything
the NFL can or cannot deny.

01:13:01.641 --> 01:13:04.776
This is bigger than they are.

01:13:04.778 --> 01:13:08.082
They have to listen to us now.

01:13:25.698 --> 01:13:27.598
Dr. Maroon.

01:13:27.600 --> 01:13:29.968
- Would you like a drink?
- I said five minutes.

01:13:29.970 --> 01:13:32.137
He doesn't want a drink.

01:13:32.139 --> 01:13:35.706
Your conclusions totally
misrepresent the facts.

01:13:35.708 --> 01:13:39.076
To say that Webster and Long and
Waters were killed by football is...

01:13:39.078 --> 01:13:41.979
Is fallacious reasoning.

01:13:41.981 --> 01:13:45.083
Yes, I know.

01:13:45.085 --> 01:13:47.552
Where's he going with this?

01:13:47.554 --> 01:13:50.155
Just hear him out.

01:13:50.157 --> 01:13:53.924
I would like to propose
a formal, controlled study

01:13:53.926 --> 01:13:57.795
of former and current NFL football players.

01:13:57.797 --> 01:14:00.531
We will bring together the greatest minds

01:14:00.533 --> 01:14:02.701
in America to solve the problem.

01:14:02.703 --> 01:14:04.505
We should be working together.

01:14:06.273 --> 01:14:09.907
Who do you think you're talking to?

01:14:09.909 --> 01:14:11.210
Excuse me?

01:14:11.212 --> 01:14:15.112
I was the President of the
Congress of Neurological Surgeons.

01:14:15.114 --> 01:14:18.250
And I was the man who
performed the autopsies

01:14:18.252 --> 01:14:21.852
on Mike Webster, Terry Long.

01:14:21.854 --> 01:14:24.522
Your men.

01:14:24.524 --> 01:14:26.727
Men under your care.

01:14:29.095 --> 01:14:31.929
Do you know what Mike Webster's wife said?

01:14:31.931 --> 01:14:36.736
She said that if she had
known that Mike was sick,

01:14:38.305 --> 01:14:41.275
she would have done more for him.

01:14:43.243 --> 01:14:48.045
But he died in disgrace.

01:14:48.047 --> 01:14:49.616
Your man.

01:14:51.083 --> 01:14:53.151
Your man.

01:14:53.153 --> 01:14:55.954
You took an oath.

01:14:55.956 --> 01:14:57.888
- Tell the truth.
- The truth?

01:14:57.890 --> 01:15:00.959
- Tell the truth!
- The truth is

01:15:00.961 --> 01:15:05.465
that the NFL is a blessing
and a salvation, my friend.

01:15:06.966 --> 01:15:10.000
We employ hundreds of thousands of people.

01:15:10.002 --> 01:15:14.071
We send thousands and thousands
of poor kids to school.

01:15:14.073 --> 01:15:16.775
The ownership of this football club

01:15:16.777 --> 01:15:20.611
has donated millions of
dollars to countless charities.

01:15:20.613 --> 01:15:22.046
Do you want me to go on?

01:15:22.048 --> 01:15:23.581
That won't be necessary.

01:15:23.583 --> 01:15:25.916
Oh, it is necessary.

01:15:25.918 --> 01:15:30.254
Football is the most
popular sport in America

01:15:30.256 --> 01:15:33.325
because it is so goddamn fantastic!

01:15:36.796 --> 01:15:39.365
And that, right there?

01:15:40.634 --> 01:15:44.835
That is the beating heart of this city.

01:15:44.837 --> 01:15:47.071
And you want to, what, end it?

01:15:47.073 --> 01:15:51.343
You want to fold up the
National Football League?

01:15:51.345 --> 01:15:53.644
I want to solve the problem.

01:15:53.646 --> 01:15:55.679
Who are you?

01:15:55.681 --> 01:15:56.947
What are you asking?

01:15:56.949 --> 01:15:58.817
You're a pathologist.

01:15:58.819 --> 01:16:00.718
You perform autopsies.

01:16:00.720 --> 01:16:02.219
Yes, I am a mere pathologist.

01:16:02.221 --> 01:16:04.690
That's it. That's all I am.

01:16:09.630 --> 01:16:12.363
Wow.

01:16:12.365 --> 01:16:15.700
Do you have any idea of the
impact of what you're doing?

01:16:15.702 --> 01:16:16.901
Yes, I do.

01:16:16.903 --> 01:16:18.335
Do you understand the impact

01:16:18.337 --> 01:16:20.371
of what you are doing?

01:16:20.373 --> 01:16:24.174
If just 10% of the mothers in America

01:16:24.176 --> 01:16:26.977
decide that football is too
dangerous for their sons to play,

01:16:26.979 --> 01:16:30.815
that is it. It is the end of football.

01:16:30.817 --> 01:16:33.418
Kids, colleges, and eventually, it's just

01:16:33.420 --> 01:16:36.254
a matter of time, the professional game.

01:16:36.256 --> 01:16:39.758
Joe, he does autopsies. He's
not in the outcome business.

01:16:39.760 --> 01:16:41.992
He has no business.

01:16:41.994 --> 01:16:45.863
Do you know what history does to people,

01:16:45.865 --> 01:16:48.133
trained physicians,

01:16:48.135 --> 01:16:50.268
- who ignore science?
- Oh, wow.

01:16:50.270 --> 01:16:52.370
Sir, I am not done!

01:16:52.372 --> 01:16:54.574
History laughs.

01:16:55.908 --> 01:16:58.942
If you continue to deny my work,

01:16:58.944 --> 01:17:01.614
the world will deny my work.

01:17:03.050 --> 01:17:06.920
But men, your men,

01:17:08.087 --> 01:17:12.459
continue to die, their
families left in ruins.

01:17:15.729 --> 01:17:17.730
Tell the truth.

01:17:19.298 --> 01:17:21.468
Tell the truth.

01:17:32.345 --> 01:17:36.281
You sure... You sure you want to do this?

01:17:36.283 --> 01:17:39.820
I would ask you that
same question, Dr. Maroon.

01:17:43.957 --> 01:17:47.494
Oh, your study, I'll get back to you.

01:17:59.939 --> 01:18:02.408
Well, that went well.

01:18:42.282 --> 01:18:46.553
When I was a boy growing up in Nigeria,

01:18:49.855 --> 01:18:55.995
heaven was here and America was here.

01:18:58.864 --> 01:19:03.469
To me, it was the place where God
sent all of His favorite people.

01:19:05.372 --> 01:19:08.708
You could be anything,
you could do anything.

01:19:10.277 --> 01:19:12.977
Americans were the manifestation

01:19:12.979 --> 01:19:15.515
of what God wanted us all to be.

01:19:20.020 --> 01:19:24.421
I have never wanted anything

01:19:24.423 --> 01:19:27.993
as much as I wanted to be
accepted as an American.

01:19:34.033 --> 01:19:39.038
But Mike Webster goes
mad and nobody asks why.

01:19:41.106 --> 01:19:43.340
They make fun of him.

01:19:43.342 --> 01:19:45.943
They insult him on TV.

01:19:45.945 --> 01:19:48.612
And now they want to pretend
that his disease does not exist.

01:19:48.614 --> 01:19:51.617
And they want to bury me.

01:19:54.554 --> 01:19:56.756
It's offensive.

01:19:58.324 --> 01:20:00.893
I am offended.

01:20:06.198 --> 01:20:10.535
I am the wrong person
to have discovered this.

01:20:14.039 --> 01:20:17.743
There is no coincidence in this world.

01:20:19.645 --> 01:20:22.347
Tell me,

01:20:22.349 --> 01:20:28.085
what is the statistical probability
that you, not just a doctor,

01:20:28.087 --> 01:20:33.156
but Bennet Omalu, came to America,

01:20:33.158 --> 01:20:36.361
ended up here in this rusty place

01:20:36.363 --> 01:20:40.600
for you alone to be the one to see this?

01:20:47.506 --> 01:20:50.142
When I arrived in New York,

01:20:51.511 --> 01:20:53.644
I was attacked.

01:20:53.646 --> 01:20:55.345
What happened?

01:20:55.347 --> 01:20:58.585
Something that is better left unsaid.

01:21:00.052 --> 01:21:03.989
But that man almost broke me.

01:21:05.926 --> 01:21:09.829
I wanted to give up and go back.

01:21:13.265 --> 01:21:15.768
But I knew God.

01:21:17.136 --> 01:21:22.741
I decided to trust His wisdom and I stayed.

01:21:25.110 --> 01:21:29.647
And now I am looking at this man,

01:21:29.649 --> 01:21:33.116
an Omalu Onyemalukwube.

01:21:33.118 --> 01:21:38.089
Your name, it means, "If you know,

01:21:38.091 --> 01:21:40.794
"you must come forth and speak."

01:21:42.561 --> 01:21:44.528
How did you know that?

01:21:44.530 --> 01:21:46.363
I called your father.

01:21:46.365 --> 01:21:48.098
He was pleased to hear from me.

01:21:48.100 --> 01:21:51.302
Yes, I am sure he was.

01:21:51.304 --> 01:21:54.908
If you don't speak for the dead, who will?

01:21:56.676 --> 01:21:59.643
You are of the Igbo tribe, Bennet.

01:21:59.645 --> 01:22:02.179
When you have truth,

01:22:02.181 --> 01:22:03.447
the thing you are told you cannot do

01:22:03.449 --> 01:22:05.983
is the thing you must do.

01:22:05.985 --> 01:22:08.318
Embrace that

01:22:08.320 --> 01:22:12.625
and nothing created by
man can bring you down.

01:22:19.064 --> 01:22:22.733
Omalu's gone to the
press now. Listen to this.

01:22:22.735 --> 01:22:25.068
"After examining the remains

01:22:25.070 --> 01:22:27.772
"of former National Football
League player Andre Waters,

01:22:27.774 --> 01:22:32.175
"a neuropathologist in Pittsburgh,
Dr. Bennet Omalu, is claiming

01:22:32.177 --> 01:22:34.245
"that Mr. Waters had sustained brain damage

01:22:34.247 --> 01:22:36.546
"from playing football, and he says

01:22:36.548 --> 01:22:41.085
"that led to his depression
and ultimate death."

01:22:41.087 --> 01:22:43.687
It gets worse.

01:22:43.689 --> 01:22:45.690
"Dr. Julian Bailes, medical director

01:22:45.692 --> 01:22:48.092

"said, 'Unfortunately, I'm not shocked.'"

01:22:55.368 --> 01:22:58.135
There's more Omalu and more Bailes.

01:22:58.137 --> 01:23:00.772
Bailes. Why do I know that name?

01:23:00.774 --> 01:23:04.541
Steelers team doctor. Neurologist
for the Players Association.

01:23:07.212 --> 01:23:09.513
- Wow.
- Yeah, wow.

01:23:09.515 --> 01:23:12.583
The <i>Times</i> is calling
it a potential epidemic.

01:23:12.585 --> 01:23:14.220
Paul.

Sure, one second.

01:24:08.875 --> 01:24:11.209
- It's Dr. Julian Bailes.
- Yes, yeah.

01:24:36.469 --> 01:24:38.138
Julian.

01:24:52.351 --> 01:24:54.652
Why don't you throw in some football stuff?

01:24:54.654 --> 01:24:56.786
Some non-medical terms?

01:24:56.788 --> 01:24:59.357
Things we'd say.

01:24:59.359 --> 01:25:02.162
Why do I need to say things they'd say?

01:25:03.262 --> 01:25:05.530
I thought I was here for the other reason.

01:25:05.532 --> 01:25:06.930
No.

01:25:06.932 --> 01:25:09.333
You have what, seven, eight degrees?

01:25:09.335 --> 01:25:10.601
You're one of the smartest people

01:25:10.603 --> 01:25:14.504
they'll ever meet. You... Well...

01:25:14.506 --> 01:25:16.507
You know what?

01:25:16.509 --> 01:25:18.845
You're gonna be fine.

01:25:27.686 --> 01:25:29.922
How about you?

01:25:31.224 --> 01:25:33.193
How will you be?

01:25:37.630 --> 01:25:44.201
You know, it is a mindless, violent
game and then it's Shakespeare.

01:25:44.203 --> 01:25:46.236
<i>I mean, to me it's
like life that way.</i>

01:25:46.238 --> 01:25:49.906
<i>And I know you can't
see how exciting</i>

01:25:49.908 --> 01:25:53.979
and beautiful all that
is, and I don't blame you.

01:25:55.247 --> 01:26:00.419
But what I'm trying to tell
you is this is not fun for me.

01:26:01.954 --> 01:26:03.653
All of the people we're going to

01:26:03.655 --> 01:26:05.289
see tomorrow, I know them personally.

01:26:05.291 --> 01:26:06.924
And that feeling you have

01:26:06.926 --> 01:26:11.998
when someone you love and
admire screws you over?

01:26:14.667 --> 01:26:17.403
They're going to have that feeling.

01:26:19.271 --> 01:26:21.273
Because of me.

01:26:22.507 --> 01:26:25.377
And there is not a damn
thing I can do about it.

01:26:45.597 --> 01:26:46.731
Hey.

01:26:46.733 --> 01:26:48.398
We have to talk.

01:26:48.400 --> 01:26:50.236
What's wrong?

01:26:52.805 --> 01:26:56.339
There's no easy way to say this,
so I'm just going to say it.

01:26:56.341 --> 01:26:58.310
They're not gonna let you speak.

01:26:59.578 --> 01:27:01.611
What?

01:27:01.613 --> 01:27:04.182
They don't even want you in the room.

01:27:06.351 --> 01:27:08.187
They want me to do it.

01:27:10.590 --> 01:27:12.757
- One of their own.
- One of their own.

01:27:12.759 --> 01:27:13.657
So, they want to pretend...

01:27:13.659 --> 01:27:15.826
That you don't even exist, that's right.

01:27:15.828 --> 01:27:17.727
Okay. Yeah.

01:27:17.729 --> 01:27:20.330
- They still have to sit and listen.
- To you.

01:27:20.332 --> 01:27:22.666
Yes. You blew up their whole world.

01:27:22.668 --> 01:27:24.035
And yours, Julian.

01:27:24.037 --> 01:27:26.736
Yes. Mine.

01:27:26.738 --> 01:27:32.876
Because how can it be possible
that some African voodoo doctor

01:27:32.878 --> 01:27:36.513
could understand this
subject better than them?

01:27:36.515 --> 01:27:39.817
Or even better than you?

01:27:39.819 --> 01:27:42.952
Wait a second. You think
this is about Bennet Omalu?

01:27:42.954 --> 01:27:45.955
I'm not here because of you. I'm
here because people are dying.

01:27:45.957 --> 01:27:47.924
You are here for redemption.

01:27:47.926 --> 01:27:51.363
You are here to use me
to cleanse your sins.

01:27:52.965 --> 01:27:56.400
You self-righteous bastard.

01:27:56.402 --> 01:28:00.403
Do you have any idea what I
could have, how much I could have

01:28:00.405 --> 01:28:05.111
if I went back to my side of the
ball and just kept my mouth shut?

01:28:06.612 --> 01:28:08.379
Everything in my world is telling me

01:28:08.381 --> 01:28:11.014
not to agree with you, except one.

01:28:11.016 --> 01:28:13.351
Science.

01:28:13.353 --> 01:28:16.053
So, here I am.

01:28:16.055 --> 01:28:20.560
Up here, beside you. Not down
there in that audience with them.

01:28:22.395 --> 01:28:26.032
What more can I do to prove myself to you?

01:28:54.694 --> 01:28:56.562
I am sorry.

01:28:58.497 --> 01:29:01.066
Convince them, Julian.

01:29:17.649 --> 01:29:20.017
You know, my father can't
remember a goddamn thing.

01:29:20.019 --> 01:29:22.152
He never played a day of football.

01:29:22.154 --> 01:29:25.156
He was too busy working
in a factory, you quack!

01:29:25.158 --> 01:29:27.057
I beg your pardon?

01:29:27.059 --> 01:29:29.960
You take your bullshit
science, go back to Africa.

01:29:29.962 --> 01:29:31.597
And get away from our game!

01:29:34.934 --> 01:29:36.767
What happened?

01:29:36.769 --> 01:29:38.936
Roger Goodell just said that

01:29:38.938 --> 01:29:42.906
Justin Strzelczyk may have
gotten his concussion swimming.

01:29:42.908 --> 01:29:44.174
In a swimming pool.

01:29:44.176 --> 01:29:45.776
That's insanity.

01:29:45.778 --> 01:29:48.111
This whole thing was staged.

01:29:48.113 --> 01:29:50.848
They needed to say that they heard
us so they could goddamn bury us.

01:29:50.850 --> 01:29:53.550
The science means nothing to them.

01:29:53.552 --> 01:29:54.919
<i>This is an important day</i>

01:29:54.921 --> 01:29:56.786
<i>in the National Football League.</i>

01:29:56.788 --> 01:29:59.156
<i>We've had some very good dialogue</i>

01:29:59.158 --> 01:30:03.227
<i>which will help us improve
the care for our players.</i>

01:30:03.229 --> 01:30:05.196
<i>What do you think
when you hear about</i>

01:30:05.198 --> 01:30:08.098
<i>former NFL players
suffering from symptoms</i>

01:30:08.100 --> 01:30:09.700
<i>that has only been seen in boxers</i>

01:30:09.702 --> 01:30:11.869
<i>and people at over 80 years old?</i>

01:30:11.871 --> 01:30:14.804
<i>I mean, what does that say about the
effect of concussions on players?</i>

01:30:14.806 --> 01:30:16.173
<i>I'm not a doctor here,</i>

01:30:16.175 --> 01:30:19.910
<i>but you have to look at
their entire medical history.</i>

01:30:19.912 --> 01:30:23.080
<i>This is an evolving
science. And that's okay.</i>

01:30:23.082 --> 01:30:25.883
<i>While I agree with the Commissioner,</i>

01:30:25.885 --> 01:30:30.653
<i>no empirically determined
proof was presented today.</i>

01:30:30.655 --> 01:30:33.490
<i>Because there simply isn't any.</i>

01:30:33.492 --> 01:30:36.494
<i>Because according to
the NFL's own numbers,</i>

01:30:36.496 --> 01:30:38.562
<i>half of all players with concussions</i>

01:30:38.564 --> 01:30:41.165
<i>are sent back into the same game,</i>

01:30:41.167 --> 01:30:44.504
<i>including some who were
actually knocked out cold.</i>

01:30:45.704 --> 01:30:48.104
<i>Ira Casson was head of the team of</i>

01:30:48.106 --> 01:30:50.708
<i>NFL doctors who had
looked into the issue</i>

01:30:50.710 --> 01:30:52.843
<i>and determined that the concern</i>

01:30:52.845 --> 01:30:55.211
<i>over head injuries was overblown.</i>

01:30:55.213 --> 01:30:58.516
<i>Is there any evidence, as
far as you're concerned,</i>

01:30:58.518 --> 01:31:00.584
<i>that links multiple head injuries</i>

01:31:00.586 --> 01:31:03.187
<i>among pro football
players with depression?</i>

01:31:03.189 --> 01:31:04.588
<i>No.</i>

01:31:04.590 --> 01:31:05.990
<i>With dementia?</i>

01:31:05.992 --> 01:31:07.590
<i>No.</i>

01:31:07.592 --> 01:31:09.527
<i>With early onset of Alzheimer's?</i>

01:31:09.529 --> 01:31:10.995
<i>No.</i>

01:31:10.997 --> 01:31:14.665
<i>Is there any evidence
as of today that links</i>

01:31:14.667 --> 01:31:18.869
<i>multiple head injuries with any
long-term problem like that?</i>

01:31:18.871 --> 01:31:21.274
<i>- In NFL players? No.
- Yeah.</i>

01:31:49.034 --> 01:31:51.237
Hey, little one.

01:31:52.637 --> 01:31:54.706
This is your father.

01:31:58.176 --> 01:32:01.246
I am in deep shit.

01:32:05.150 --> 01:32:07.786
I have not done anything wrong,

01:32:09.721 --> 01:32:12.424
but I am being punished.

01:32:18.597 --> 01:32:22.635
It might not be so nice
when you get out here.

01:32:26.204 --> 01:32:28.808
You are still with God.

01:32:30.810 --> 01:32:34.247
Please ask Him to help me.

01:33:05.176 --> 01:33:07.647
It's all right. It's okay.

01:33:14.052 --> 01:33:17.220
- What is this?
- This is the FBI.

01:33:17.222 --> 01:33:19.822
Apparently, I'm being
relieved of my duties.

01:33:19.824 --> 01:33:21.724
What? I don't understand.

01:33:21.726 --> 01:33:23.160
Dr. Wecht has been indicted

01:33:23.162 --> 01:33:25.361
on 84 federal counts, including...

01:33:25.363 --> 01:33:29.032
Please, please, Tex. Let me at
least have the joy of telling him.

01:33:29.034 --> 01:33:32.236
I'm being indicted on 84 federal counts,

01:33:32.238 --> 01:33:34.838
including mail fraud, wire fraud,

01:33:34.840 --> 01:33:38.174
other related offenses, arising out of

01:33:38.176 --> 01:33:42.879
my use of government resources
to advance my private practice.

01:33:42.881 --> 01:33:47.284
Including, but not limited
to, uh, mileage vouchers,

01:33:47.286 --> 01:33:52.724
misuse of office stationery and
my personal use of the fax machine.

01:33:54.426 --> 01:33:56.192
- Faxes?
- Yeah.

01:33:56.194 --> 01:33:58.594
They could not come up with
something this stupid in Nigeria.

01:33:59.931 --> 01:34:02.500
This man has been a
public servant for decades.

01:34:04.436 --> 01:34:06.803
Cyril.

01:34:06.805 --> 01:34:10.007
Have you ever performed any
private services on county time?

01:34:10.009 --> 01:34:12.041
- Have I?
- Whoa!

01:34:12.043 --> 01:34:14.844
Apparently, we've both hurt
the government's feelings.

01:34:16.282 --> 01:34:20.284
Are you referring to the death row
case where I used my personal time?

01:34:20.286 --> 01:34:24.187
We don't want you, Dr.
Omalu, but we can have you.

01:34:24.189 --> 01:34:25.856
And what does that mean?

01:34:25.858 --> 01:34:27.626
That means they want your testimony.

01:34:29.895 --> 01:34:33.263
- Against you?
- Yes.

01:34:33.265 --> 01:34:36.099
I... I understand.

01:34:36.101 --> 01:34:39.803
You are attacking him to get to me.

01:34:39.805 --> 01:34:42.071
I know.

01:34:42.073 --> 01:34:45.209
This is because his name is on my research.

01:34:45.211 --> 01:34:46.442
What research is that?

01:34:48.447 --> 01:34:50.481
No. I will resign first.

01:34:50.483 --> 01:34:53.951
In which case, your immigration
status will be revised

01:34:53.953 --> 01:34:57.353
since your status requires
full-time employment.

01:34:57.355 --> 01:35:00.324
Then I will get another
job in another city.

01:35:00.326 --> 01:35:01.791
That would be fine.

01:35:01.793 --> 01:35:03.895
That would be fine.

01:35:12.872 --> 01:35:14.739
Bennet.

01:35:25.984 --> 01:35:30.353
All I asked is that if you did
this, we both came out okay.

01:35:30.355 --> 01:35:32.491
Not professional ruination.

01:35:35.528 --> 01:35:37.393
Whoever...

01:35:37.395 --> 01:35:40.433
Whatever takes over for me,

01:35:42.268 --> 01:35:45.703
they're going to want the CTE
information, you know that.

01:35:46.939 --> 01:35:49.071
What if they show up here with a warrant?

01:35:49.073 --> 01:35:51.241
On suspicion of what? Science?

01:35:51.243 --> 01:35:55.245
Ah, suspicion of bullshit. We got screwed.

01:35:55.247 --> 01:35:58.248
You didn't deserve it.

01:35:58.250 --> 01:36:01.585
You know the worst part? How easy it was.

01:36:01.587 --> 01:36:06.557
Cyril, they are not going to
make me say one word against you.

01:36:06.559 --> 01:36:08.892
What are you gonna say?

01:36:08.894 --> 01:36:12.396
Cyril Wecht's a loudmouth asshole?

01:36:12.398 --> 01:36:15.365
I don't care. I'm tired.

01:36:15.367 --> 01:36:17.502
My balls are low.

01:36:24.376 --> 01:36:27.011
I didn't do good enough by you.

01:36:29.180 --> 01:36:30.882
Cyril, um...

01:36:32.952 --> 01:36:35.621
I cannot go back to Nigeria.

01:36:37.323 --> 01:36:40.593
Everything that I am is here.

01:36:42.161 --> 01:36:46.062
My child has got to be born in America.

01:36:47.365 --> 01:36:49.066
Don't worry.

01:36:49.068 --> 01:36:51.468
I'll get you a job.

01:36:51.470 --> 01:36:54.303
Hey, you can work with
me in the prison laundry.

01:37:00.011 --> 01:37:02.144
Call the surgeon.

01:37:02.146 --> 01:37:04.582
We need a goddamn drink.

01:38:02.140 --> 01:38:04.641
I solved the problem.

01:38:04.643 --> 01:38:06.710
All they have to do is put
on the side of the helmet,

01:38:06.712 --> 01:38:09.312
"The Surgeon General has determined that

01:38:09.314 --> 01:38:11.481
"playing football is
hazardous to your health."

01:38:11.483 --> 01:38:13.416
You got to put it on
both sides of the helmet.

01:38:26.998 --> 01:38:28.432
Did you know that Paul Tagliabue...

01:38:28.434 --> 01:38:30.567
This is the former Commissioner Tagliabue,

01:38:30.569 --> 01:38:33.503
did you know that Paul was a
partner in Covington and Burling?

01:38:33.505 --> 01:38:35.237
Which is the same law firm that represented

01:38:35.239 --> 01:38:36.540
the big seven tobacco companies.

01:38:36.542 --> 01:38:38.308
Of course he was.

01:38:38.310 --> 01:38:39.710
But now they're representing
the National Football League.

01:38:39.712 --> 01:38:41.981
Of course they do.

01:38:51.556 --> 01:38:53.589
<i>My last year with the Steelers,</i>

01:38:53.591 --> 01:38:57.361
we moved a game from a Sunday to
a Tuesday because of a blizzard.

01:38:57.363 --> 01:38:59.662
And the League said that they
weren't concerned about the ratings

01:38:59.664 --> 01:39:02.732
because the League was
immune from acts of God.

01:39:25.390 --> 01:39:27.324
Bennet!

01:39:27.326 --> 01:39:28.861
Bennet!

01:39:54.685 --> 01:39:56.253
I'm so sorry.

01:39:56.255 --> 01:39:58.690
There's no heartbeat.

01:40:02.261 --> 01:40:04.693
May... May we have the room, please?

01:40:04.695 --> 01:40:07.131
Excuse us. Thank you.

01:40:24.716 --> 01:40:27.550
I'm so sorry.

01:40:27.552 --> 01:40:30.687
I'm so sorry. I made a mistake.

01:40:30.689 --> 01:40:33.089
This is my fault.

01:40:58.149 --> 01:41:01.953
<i>Dr. Pierson, E.R. med one.
Dr. Pierson, E.R. med one.</i>

01:41:04.655 --> 01:41:07.893
I wish I had never met Mike Webster.

01:41:12.197 --> 01:41:14.767
They destroyed us.

01:41:17.603 --> 01:41:22.907
And I don't understand why
it is happening this way.

01:41:26.310 --> 01:41:28.846
Bennet, listen to me.

01:41:31.350 --> 01:41:35.020
Do you know what I chose to fake?

01:41:39.725 --> 01:41:41.260
You.

01:41:47.365 --> 01:41:49.799
We will have this family.

01:41:49.801 --> 01:41:51.835
Yes.

01:41:51.837 --> 01:41:53.939
We will.

01:41:56.507 --> 01:41:58.844
Just not here.

01:42:01.747 --> 01:42:04.082
We have to go.

01:42:39.650 --> 01:42:42.187
Hello? Mr. Omalu?

01:42:44.789 --> 01:42:46.589
Dr. Omalu.

01:42:46.591 --> 01:42:49.460
I just need the measurements
for the flat screens.

01:42:51.563 --> 01:42:54.032
That won't be necessary.

01:45:29.954 --> 01:45:33.423
Tell me what happened to you, Jose.

01:45:33.425 --> 01:45:35.959
Tell me.

01:45:35.961 --> 01:45:38.093
It's going to be okay.

01:45:47.838 --> 01:45:49.606
Listen.

01:45:49.608 --> 01:45:52.142
My mind keeps slipping.

01:45:52.144 --> 01:45:55.778
I can't seem to find the
goddamn words no more.

01:45:55.780 --> 01:45:57.381
What?

01:46:01.185 --> 01:46:03.388
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:46:05.590 --> 01:46:07.857
I just can't do this.

01:46:07.859 --> 01:46:10.062
And I'm sorry.

01:46:52.938 --> 01:46:54.169
Yes.

01:46:54.171 --> 01:46:56.173
<i>Bennet, it's Julian.</i>

01:46:57.975 --> 01:47:01.477
Dave Duerson killed himself today.

01:47:01.479 --> 01:47:03.946
<i>Shot himself in the
chest. In the heart.</i>

01:47:03.948 --> 01:47:06.183
Hold on, hold on.

01:47:11.789 --> 01:47:14.824
- My God.
- <i>He left a note.</i>

01:47:14.826 --> 01:47:16.826
<i>He wants his brain to be donated.</i>

01:47:16.828 --> 01:47:18.697
To be examined.

01:47:22.100 --> 01:47:24.369
They said that we were right.

01:47:28.606 --> 01:47:30.509
<i>Benny, you there?</i>

01:47:31.542 --> 01:47:33.745
Yes. Yes, I'm here.

01:47:36.247 --> 01:47:39.115
<i>A Pro Bowler in that
deep with NFL leadership</i>

01:47:39.117 --> 01:47:40.950
killing himself in the
way he killed himself,

01:47:40.952 --> 01:47:43.288
they can't explain this one away.

01:47:44.588 --> 01:47:46.590
<i>Players are gonna want
to hear from you now.</i>

01:47:54.565 --> 01:47:56.598
Trying to find the...

01:48:14.319 --> 01:48:17.289
I don't know what to say to them.

01:48:21.626 --> 01:48:24.328
Tell them what's really happening.

01:49:13.612 --> 01:49:14.777
<i>Hello.</i>

01:49:16.715 --> 01:49:18.582
<i>Um...</i>

01:49:20.885 --> 01:49:24.723
<i>A small boy, uh, came to me</i>

01:49:25.923 --> 01:49:29.358
<i>and said, "Mister, why
do you hate football?"</i>

01:49:29.360 --> 01:49:32.394
<i>I said, "I don't hate football."</i>

01:49:32.396 --> 01:49:36.199
<i>He said, "Yes, my father
said you hate football."</i>

01:49:36.201 --> 01:49:38.634
<i>I said, "You tell your
father to come see me."</i>

01:49:43.408 --> 01:49:47.110
<i>My wife watches the games.</i>

01:49:47.112 --> 01:49:51.147
<i>And she will scream
and she will jump.</i>

01:49:51.149 --> 01:49:53.752
<i>She startles me a lot.</i>

01:49:56.121 --> 01:49:59.757
<i>But through her eyes,
I can see the beauty</i>

01:50:00.824 --> 01:50:04.795
<i>and the grace, the power.</i>

01:50:08.198 --> 01:50:11.769
<i>I said to her that I wished
I'd never met Mike Webster.</i>

01:50:23.881 --> 01:50:26.450
<i>But that was before I knew him.</i>

01:50:29.787 --> 01:50:34.558
<i>He has given me a great gift.</i>

01:50:37.261 --> 01:50:39.596
<i>A dangerous gift.</i>

01:50:41.265 --> 01:50:43.200
<i>The gift of knowing.</i>

01:50:46.037 --> 01:50:50.440
<i>When a man is a soldier,
he knows what is at risk.</i>

01:50:50.442 --> 01:50:53.745
<i>He may be injured or even killed.</i>

01:50:56.113 --> 01:50:59.348
<i>But when a man is a football player,</i>

01:50:59.350 --> 01:51:04.187
<i>he knows he may break
his arm or his leg.</i>

01:51:04.189 --> 01:51:08.859
<i>He does not know that
he can lose his mind.</i>

01:51:10.261 --> 01:51:12.829
<i>His family, his money.</i>

01:51:15.132 --> 01:51:16.901
<i>His life.</i>

01:51:19.037 --> 01:51:21.739
<i>They have to know.</i>

01:51:26.978 --> 01:51:29.812
<i>Mike Webster.</i>

01:51:29.814 --> 01:51:31.748
<i>Justin Strzelczyk.</i>

01:51:31.750 --> 01:51:34.083

<i>By dying, they speak for the living.</i>

01:51:47.297 --> 01:51:49.666
<i>And I speak for them.</i>

01:51:51.168 --> 01:51:53.537
<i>That is all I do.</i>

01:51:56.306 --> 01:51:58.442
<i>Forgive them.</i>

01:52:01.479 --> 01:52:03.782
<i>Forgive yourselves.</i>

01:52:09.988 --> 01:52:11.956
<i>Be at peace.</i>

01:52:17.796 --> 01:52:21.930
<i>Commissioner Goodell,
is there a link between</i>

01:52:21.932 --> 01:52:25.000
<i>playing professional
football and the likelihood</i>

01:52:25.002 --> 01:52:29.304
<i>of contracting a
brain-related injury</i>

01:52:29.306 --> 01:52:34.509
<i>such as dementia, Alzheimer's,
depression or CTE?</i>

01:52:34.511 --> 01:52:38.013
<i>We're doing everything we
possibly can for our players now.</i>

01:52:38.015 --> 01:52:41.183
<i>I just asked you a simple
question. What's the answer?</i>

01:52:41.185 --> 01:52:42.852
<i>It sort of reminds me</i>

01:52:42.854 --> 01:52:46.022
<i>of the tobacco companies, pre-'90s,</i>

01:52:46.024 --> 01:52:48.424
<i>when they kept saying,
"No, there's no link</i>

01:52:48.426 --> 01:52:51.027
<i>"between smoking and, um,
damage to your health,</i>

01:52:51.029 --> 01:52:53.161
<i>"or ill health effects."</i>

01:52:53.163 --> 01:52:56.566
<i>And they were forced to
admit that that was incorrect</i>

01:52:56.568 --> 01:52:59.235
<i>through a spate of
litigation in the 1990s.</i>

01:52:59.237 --> 01:53:02.170
<i>And my question to you is...</i>

01:53:02.172 --> 01:53:03.572
<i>Oh, we have heard</i>

01:53:03.574 --> 01:53:05.342
<i>from the NFL time and time again.</i>

01:53:05.344 --> 01:53:09.277
<i>You're always "studying," you're
always "trying," you're "hopeful."</i>

01:53:09.279 --> 01:53:11.112
Son of a bitch.

01:53:11.114 --> 01:53:12.982
<i>I want to know what are you doing</i>

01:53:12.984 --> 01:53:14.817
<i>in the negotiations
that are going on now</i>

01:53:14.819 --> 01:53:19.888
<i>to deal with this problem and the
other problems related to the injuries</i>

01:53:19.890 --> 01:53:26.329
<i>that football players obtain
and its impact on their health.</i>

01:53:26.331 --> 01:53:28.363
You did all this.

01:53:28.365 --> 01:53:30.133
<i>I know my time is
drawing to a close,</i>

01:53:30.135 --> 01:53:35.237
<i>but let me just say this to Mr. Goodell,
uh, and everybody who's here today</i>

01:53:35.239 --> 01:53:38.007
<i>that I think it's
time for the Congress</i>

01:53:38.009 --> 01:53:40.644
<i>of the United States to take a look.</i>

01:53:42.947 --> 01:53:43.646
First time in Washington?

01:53:43.648 --> 01:53:46.214
Uh, yes.

01:53:46.216 --> 01:53:48.284
Well, we're thrilled you
accepted our invitation.

01:53:48.286 --> 01:53:50.988
I was, uh, very curious.

01:53:52.489 --> 01:53:55.523
Chief Medical Examiner
for Washington, D.C.,

01:53:55.525 --> 01:53:58.894
means you would also
consult with the CIA and FBI

01:53:58.896 --> 01:54:00.196
and any foreign government

01:54:00.198 --> 01:54:04.232
requesting the assistance of
the United States government.

01:54:04.234 --> 01:54:07.469
Essentially, you're America's
forensic pathologist.

01:54:07.471 --> 01:54:11.607
Wouldn't have to put on
scrubs or perform an autopsy.

01:54:11.609 --> 01:54:14.112
You're beyond all that now.

01:54:19.250 --> 01:54:21.217
Would you like to hear
about the benefits package?

01:54:21.219 --> 01:54:23.352
No.

01:54:23.354 --> 01:54:25.556
I mean, I'm sure it's fine.

01:54:31.930 --> 01:54:36.398
We know everything you did, Dr. Omalu.

01:54:36.400 --> 01:54:40.702
You exemplify everything
it is to be an American.

01:54:40.704 --> 01:54:44.108
You belong here with us,
in the nation's capital.

01:54:58.189 --> 01:55:01.926
Why don't you take a couple
days and think about it?

01:55:35.460 --> 01:55:36.894
Ready.

01:55:39.296 --> 01:55:41.330
Hut!

01:55:41.332 --> 01:55:43.499
Get up, get up field, get
up field, get up field!

01:55:43.501 --> 01:55:45.534
You heard him. Move up field, let's go!

01:55:45.536 --> 01:55:47.236
You, on the ball, on the ball.

01:55:47.238 --> 01:55:49.841
Okay, let's huddle up!
Bring it back, huddle up.

01:55:53.677 --> 01:55:57.079
All right, call it out!
Douglas, I'm talkin' to you.

01:55:57.081 --> 01:55:58.347
Hut!

01:55:58.349 --> 01:55:59.389
Get 'em, get 'em, get 'em!

01:56:00.518 --> 01:56:01.717
That's it. Good!

01:56:01.719 --> 01:56:04.219
There you go. Good job,
good job, on the ball.

01:56:04.221 --> 01:56:06.690
- Let's go, let's go, tempo, tempo!
- Tempo, tempo!

01:56:13.230 --> 01:56:15.598
How 'bout we hit somebody this time, huh?

01:56:15.600 --> 01:56:17.465
Try a little more contact.

01:56:17.467 --> 01:56:18.935
One-sixteen,
one-sixteen!
