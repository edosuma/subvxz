00:58.015 --> 00:59.100
Got anything to drink?

01:00.643 --> 01:01.478
I don't drink.

01:10.486 --> 01:11.320
No.

01:12.572 --> 01:14.031
Keep your clothes on.

01:19.287 --> 01:20.705
How much do I owe you?

01:21.873 --> 01:22.707
Well,

01:24.668 --> 01:38.178
it's $300.

01:40.891 --> 01:41.850
What's your name?

01:42.686 --> 01:43.517
Cherry.

01:43.519 --> 01:44.476
Cherry what?

01:44.478 --> 01:45.730
Cherry Pie.

01:47.272 --> 01:52.359
Don't you wanna know my name?

01:52.361 --> 01:53.237
What's your name?

01:54.697 --> 01:55.531
Robert.

01:57.325 --> 01:58.157
Well, Robert,

01:58.159 --> 02:00.535
usually, we'd be naked by now,

02:00.537 --> 02:03.665
but since neither of us
are taking our clothes off,

02:05.582 --> 02:06.416
what do you want?

02:06.418 --> 02:08.792
Just to talk.

02:08.794 --> 02:10.210
What do you want
to talk about?

02:10.211 --> 02:18.094
It doesn't matter,
just start talking.

02:18.096 --> 02:19.472
I'm not much of a talker.

02:23.768 --> 02:24.644
Are you loved?

02:26.937 --> 02:27.771
Yes.

02:28.981 --> 02:29.816
By whom?

02:32.318 --> 02:33.153
By my honey bunny.

02:34.403 --> 02:35.320
She loves me.

02:36.322 --> 02:37.488
- You're a mother?
- Yes.

02:37.490 --> 02:39.492
And, a whore?

02:43.955 --> 02:45.165
I have two jobs.

02:46.707 --> 02:48.043
One doesn't pay so well.

02:51.253 --> 02:52.796
Ask me if I'm loved.

02:55.300 --> 03:01.304
Are you loved?

03:01.306 --> 03:02.637
Have you ever felt like

03:02.639 --> 03:04.306
you were meant to
die a long time ago,

03:04.308 --> 03:05.977
but somehow, you cheated death?

03:07.103 --> 03:11.439
No.

03:11.441 --> 03:12.275
Well,

03:17.197 --> 03:18.988
I shouldn't be here.

03:18.990 --> 03:22.741
All I do is hurt things,

03:22.743 --> 03:27.454
and sometimes, just to
see if I feel anything,

03:27.456 --> 03:29.000
and I don't,

03:29.876 --> 03:30.710
not ever,

03:32.503 --> 03:33.629
and that's how I know

03:36.675 --> 03:39.010
I'm not supposed to be here.

03:40.469 --> 03:44.515
I think you need someone,

03:47.227 --> 03:50.396
but more knowledgeable
to talk to than me.

03:54.025 --> 03:54.859
Like you.

03:55.526 --> 03:56.527
You're here with me.

04:00.740 --> 04:03.031
I bet your heart is
racing right now.

04:03.033 --> 04:05.036
Oh, and I'd see you thinking,

04:05.328 --> 04:08.789
"How quickly can I get to
the door before he stops me?"

04:10.457 --> 04:12.502
All of that that you're feeling,

04:15.045 --> 04:16.548
you wanna know what I'm feeling?

04:23.096 --> 04:24.096
I'm feeling nothing.

04:25.723 --> 04:27.598
This was a mistake.

04:27.600 --> 04:30.017
- Mistake?
- Yes, yes.

04:30.019 --> 04:32.187
There's no such thing.

04:33.355 --> 04:34.774
I don't know what's
waiting for me,

04:36.067 --> 04:38.108
everything that I've done.

04:38.110 --> 04:39.403
I just wanna go home.

04:40.321 --> 04:41.486
But I can't go alone.

05:29.454 --> 05:39.921
Nothing.

06:10.286 --> 06:11.952
There you are.

06:21.548 --> 06:22.382
Where am I?

06:23.757 --> 06:24.591
Home.

06:46.613 --> 06:48.699
This is a way to give back.

06:50.535 --> 06:53.663
There's so much to
be done, Francesca.

07:07.093 --> 07:07.925
There you are.

07:09.553 --> 07:10.387
Hi, honey.

07:12.348 --> 07:13.182
It's okay.

07:14.184 --> 07:15.018
It's okay.

07:15.935 --> 07:16.769
It's okay.

07:18.312 --> 07:19.687
They'll come home.

07:19.689 --> 07:24.274
She knew if this duck was
ever going to survive,

07:24.276 --> 07:29.613
she would have to help him.

07:29.615 --> 07:31.865
She named the duckling Time,

07:31.867 --> 07:34.202
because she knew that's
what it would take

07:34.204 --> 07:35.579
to teach him how to fly.

07:37.206 --> 07:39.207
Time wanted to
give up many times,

07:39.209 --> 07:41.086
but she refused to let him.

07:41.670 --> 07:43.586
"You were put on
this earth to fly,

07:43.588 --> 07:46.424
"and fly you will,"
she told him.

07:47.466 --> 07:48.757
So, Time marched on,

07:48.759 --> 07:50.803
and she kept trying.

07:59.103 --> 08:00.728
All interviewees,

08:00.730 --> 08:03.606
please report to the correct
designated room indicated

08:03.608 --> 08:05.108
on your red invitation card.

08:05.110 --> 08:06.692
Thank you.

08:06.694 --> 08:10.320
Three helpful tips to conduct
a successful interview:

08:10.322 --> 08:12.865
always remember to be
honest, be yourself,

08:12.867 --> 08:14.242
and most importantly,

08:14.244 --> 08:15.412
don't forget to smile.

08:43.773 --> 08:45.230
Please have a seat.

08:45.232 --> 08:48.485
Your interview wait time is
approximately 47 minutes.

09:04.376 --> 09:05.836
Did the interviews start yet?

09:11.509 --> 09:14.553
And I didn't know I
could speak English.

09:44.833 --> 09:46.960
Which one
do you wanna sleep with?

09:47.879 --> 09:48.710
The duck.

09:48.712 --> 09:49.545
The duck.

09:49.547 --> 09:50.382
Okay, sweetheart.

09:51.341 --> 09:52.174
There you go, honey.

10:09.317 --> 10:12.859
♪ Row, row, row your boat ♪

10:12.861 --> 10:13.779
Sir will see you now.

11:23.932 --> 11:26.350
This job requires
a lot of travel,

11:26.352 --> 11:28.018
and I see here you have not done

11:28.020 --> 11:30.897
any traveling at all, Francesca.

11:30.899 --> 11:33.023
I've been through a lot.

11:33.025 --> 11:34.483
And do you think life
was meant to be difficult

11:34.485 --> 11:35.818
or life was meant to be easy?

11:35.820 --> 11:37.739
I haven't met anyone that
would say life is easy.

11:39.783 --> 11:40.823
Is your actual name Sir?

11:40.825 --> 11:43.203
So, you think life is
meant to be difficult?

11:44.370 --> 11:45.579
Easy or hard, it
doesn't really matter.

11:53.004 --> 11:54.002
You're writing that down?

11:54.004 --> 11:54.838
I am.

11:56.048 --> 11:57.422
And, you think because
I haven't traveled much,

11:57.424 --> 11:58.424
it's a disadvantage.

11:58.426 --> 11:59.842
Is it not?

11:59.844 --> 12:01.638
I don't think I have to
leave to see the world.

12:02.806 --> 12:04.137
I mean, I've encountered
every kind of man,

12:04.139 --> 12:05.140
woman, too.

12:06.475 --> 12:07.432
In my line of work,

12:07.434 --> 12:08.725
the world came to me,

12:08.727 --> 12:10.103
and that world
isn't very pretty.

12:10.105 --> 12:11.646
I read that in your file.

12:11.648 --> 12:13.940
You know what? Not everything
in there's 100% accurate.

12:13.942 --> 12:15.400
There are two sides
to every story.

12:15.402 --> 12:17.987
Oh, and what certain
story are you referring to?

12:20.072 --> 12:20.906
All of them.

12:25.370 --> 12:27.288
What is it that
you think we do here?

12:28.123 --> 12:29.708
Something about transitioning.

12:30.207 --> 12:31.623
Mm hmm.

12:31.625 --> 12:33.584
It involves helping people,
and I'd be good at that.

12:33.586 --> 12:34.919
I've helped a lot of people.

12:34.921 --> 12:36.753
Well, and I think you
can help a lot of people,

12:36.755 --> 12:38.046
and you do definitely have

12:38.048 --> 12:39.674
that advantage over
other applicants,

12:39.676 --> 12:41.175
but in every other field,

12:41.177 --> 12:45.555
you are by far the least qualified
person I have seen today.

12:45.557 --> 12:47.933
I'm the least qualified
in everything I do.

12:49.019 --> 12:49.852
So, why should I consider you?

12:50.394 --> 12:51.935
Because I won't quit.

12:51.937 --> 12:55.734
Ah, and you think that all
the other applicants will quit?

12:56.567 --> 12:57.775
Well, there's an opening.

12:57.777 --> 13:00.027
Somebody didn't do their job.

13:00.029 --> 13:01.113
Why are you really here?

13:02.698 --> 13:04.825
- I told you.
- No, you didn't.

13:06.660 --> 13:09.369
Honesty is very important here.

13:09.371 --> 13:11.290
Well, if you already
know why I'm here,

13:13.208 --> 13:14.584
why do I have to say it?

13:14.586 --> 13:18.378
If I were to consider
you for this job,

13:18.380 --> 13:20.464
you can't see her.

13:20.466 --> 13:21.759
Do you understand that?

13:22.677 --> 13:23.552
Not yet,

13:25.804 --> 13:26.887
but if I do a good job,

13:26.889 --> 13:27.847
then I can see her?

13:27.849 --> 13:28.890
That's true, but...

13:28.892 --> 13:31.099
That's why I will
get the job done.

13:31.101 --> 13:33.228
I will do whatever it takes.

13:35.940 --> 13:37.567
I need to see my little girl.

13:45.200 --> 13:46.408
One last question.

13:52.039 --> 13:54.415
You're in a desert,

13:54.417 --> 13:57.671
and there's a turtle
on its back dying.

13:58.962 --> 13:59.921
Do you blame the turtle

13:59.923 --> 14:02.966
for putting himself
in this position?

14:04.259 --> 14:05.759
Do you blame the desert

14:05.761 --> 14:08.554
for setting the
scene of its death,

14:08.556 --> 14:11.309
or is it the sun

14:13.102 --> 14:14.520
for causing its death?

14:15.688 --> 14:17.146
That's a stupid question.

14:17.148 --> 14:18.147
is that your answer?

14:18.149 --> 14:20.400
No, the answer is
there's no answer,

14:20.402 --> 14:22.026
because the turtle doesn't die.

14:22.028 --> 14:23.695
If I'm in the desert,

14:23.697 --> 14:25.278
I don't blame someone.

14:25.280 --> 14:26.699
I just flip the fucker over.

14:29.244 --> 14:30.158
Done.

14:30.160 --> 14:31.618
Random or not, I intervene.

14:31.620 --> 14:33.621
But the turtle is
still in the desert.

14:33.623 --> 14:35.123
Well, it found a way in.

14:35.125 --> 14:37.624
It could find a way out.

14:37.626 --> 14:38.836
Like you in my office.

14:41.589 --> 14:47.093
Good day, Francesca.

14:49.014 --> 14:50.306
Can I ask you a question?

14:51.349 --> 14:52.598
What is your question?

14:52.600 --> 14:54.224
How is she?

14:54.226 --> 14:56.937
She's a bright little
girl with a bright future.

14:58.313 --> 14:59.982
That's all I can
say at this point.

15:45.528 --> 15:48.656
Why do you insist that
we meet down here?

15:49.323 --> 15:51.114
I work down here,

15:51.116 --> 15:52.992
and it keeps me fresh.

15:52.994 --> 15:54.410
I don't get that
lost, puppy dog look.

15:54.412 --> 15:56.498
I do not have a
lost, puppy dog look.

15:56.748 --> 16:00.291
Well, you do, but
that's why I'm here,

16:00.293 --> 16:01.376
so I can do the dirty work,

16:01.378 --> 16:03.920
and you can hand
over a folder, so...

16:03.922 --> 16:04.798
Francesca,

16:06.216 --> 16:10.220
your way of getting things
done have many concerned.

16:12.931 --> 16:15.138
Do I get the job done?

16:15.140 --> 16:16.682
Yes.

16:16.684 --> 16:18.767
Faster and more effective
than anyone else in the region?

16:18.769 --> 16:20.103
No one is questioning
your record.

16:20.105 --> 16:22.063
I am talking about your methods.

16:22.065 --> 16:24.398
If I was a man, you'd
be calling me James Bond.

16:24.400 --> 16:26.566
I was just told
to suggest to you

16:26.568 --> 16:30.405
that perhaps the sexual acts
could be kept to a minimum.

16:30.407 --> 16:33.407
It's like telling
the ocean to dry off.

16:33.409 --> 16:34.868
It's not gonna happen.

16:35.662 --> 16:36.495
Men...

16:37.621 --> 16:39.832
Really, a dollar?

16:43.336 --> 16:44.504
I gotta get a new job.

16:46.255 --> 16:47.089
Thank you.

16:47.716 --> 16:49.174
So, where am I going?

16:50.259 --> 16:51.175
Reno.

16:51.177 --> 16:53.301
It's a double-double.

16:53.303 --> 16:55.345
The agent who was
on this failed,

16:55.347 --> 16:56.973
so if you want the
job, it's yours.

16:56.975 --> 16:57.808
Yes.

16:59.019 --> 17:01.643
Remember to not get
emotionally attached.

17:01.645 --> 17:04.188
- Just physically.
- No.

17:04.190 --> 17:05.316
I'm being serious.

17:06.608 --> 17:08.359
- You do this, and...
- I can see her?

17:10.363 --> 17:12.779
I'm not making any promises,

17:12.781 --> 17:17.118
but this job does
end in Los Angeles.

17:24.210 --> 17:25.292
I just wanna see her face.

17:25.295 --> 17:27.255
Focus on the job first,

17:28.173 --> 17:30.297
and then we'll talk.

17:30.299 --> 17:31.134

19:29.294 --> 19:33.421
I just had this stupid
conference I had to attend.

19:33.423 --> 19:34.883
I was just about to leave.

19:35.549 --> 19:36.550
What do you do?

19:37.009 --> 19:38.802
I'm a consultant for
an appliance company.

19:39.929 --> 19:40.844
It's a lot more
boring than it sounds.

19:40.846 --> 19:41.679
It sounds pretty boring.

19:42.515 --> 19:44.100
Yeah, it's so boring.

19:46.728 --> 19:47.562
I'm Michael.

19:48.395 --> 19:49.230
Layla.

19:50.397 --> 19:51.607
That's a pretty name.

19:52.442 --> 19:53.482
Thank you.

19:53.484 --> 19:54.318
I gave it to myself.

19:56.820 --> 19:57.654
Right.

20:00.200 --> 20:01.114
I should get going.

20:01.116 --> 20:02.993
I got a long drive ahead of me.

20:03.452 --> 20:05.538
You wanna walk with me?

20:07.248 --> 20:09.250
I'm just gonna say
that it was a pleasure.

20:10.669 --> 20:12.170
The pleasure was all mine.

20:17.549 --> 20:22.555
♪ You say you wanna
be alone since me ♪

20:25.392 --> 20:33.064
♪ But ain't no roll of the dice
since you gambled with me ♪

20:33.066 --> 20:37.444
♪ You say you wanna
be alone since me ♪

20:42.366 --> 20:43.992
Can I call you a cab, or?

20:45.537 --> 20:46.954
I'm still taking my walk.

20:51.835 --> 20:53.211
Where are you walking to?

20:53.920 --> 20:54.754
That's up to you.

20:56.756 --> 20:58.547
What do you mean?

20:58.549 --> 20:59.800
You know what I mean.

21:02.554 --> 21:03.388
Oh.

21:05.347 --> 21:07.556
I really shouldn't.

21:07.558 --> 21:10.601
There's a meteor
shower tonight.

21:10.603 --> 21:12.147
Doesn't that sound beautiful?

21:13.480 --> 21:15.107
It would be a shame
to see it alone.

21:18.569 --> 21:20.111
I want to, I just don't...

21:20.113 --> 21:22.115
You say "don't" a lot.

21:22.699 --> 21:23.530
No, I don't.

21:29.329 --> 21:30.497
The thing is I'm married.

21:32.166 --> 21:33.999
And I'm left-handed.

21:34.001 --> 21:34.836
Well, I'd feel...

21:36.462 --> 21:38.339
I'd love what you feel.

21:43.178 --> 21:44.095
Good night.

21:46.096 --> 21:46.931
Okay.

21:47.807 --> 21:49.099
I'll walk with you.

21:51.603 --> 21:52.937
Where are you walking me to?

21:54.146 --> 21:54.980
My hotel.

21:57.483 --> 21:59.651
Are you asking me
out on a date, Michael?

22:02.071 --> 22:02.905
I guess I am.

22:03.906 --> 22:04.823
Yeah, I don't know.

22:06.742 --> 22:07.951
I'm an expensive date.

22:09.371 --> 22:10.202
How expensive?

22:10.204 --> 22:11.538
$150 an hour.

22:14.500 --> 22:16.877
I guess it'll be
a short date then.

22:19.631 --> 22:22.008
That's my favorite kind.

22:26.637 --> 22:28.054
♪ You roll it once or twice ♪

22:28.056 --> 22:30.975
♪ Let the devil in ♪

22:47.116 --> 22:48.283
I've never done this.

22:49.661 --> 22:50.912
Never fucked your wife?

22:52.204 --> 22:53.163
Of course I have.

22:54.624 --> 22:56.125
Well, it's just like that,

22:56.584 --> 22:58.042
but with me.

23:00.797 --> 23:02.214
Then why am I so nervous?

23:06.260 --> 23:07.301
I'm pretty sure that

23:07.303 --> 23:09.931
you're the prettiest
girl I've ever seen.

23:12.433 --> 23:16.561
And you haven't even
seen all of me yet.

23:16.563 --> 23:17.522
Just for tonight,

23:18.940 --> 23:20.357
we change your name,

23:21.067 --> 23:22.067
your job,

23:23.653 --> 23:26.988
we ignite your imagination.

23:26.990 --> 23:28.450
We enter a new world.

23:29.616 --> 23:30.826
How does that sound?

23:34.998 --> 23:37.208
That sounds really good.

23:37.625 --> 23:40.127
We need something
smart, but sexy.

23:41.211 --> 23:42.047
Alexander.

23:43.213 --> 23:44.131
You like that name?

23:45.717 --> 23:46.551
I can be Alexander.

23:47.594 --> 23:49.971
So, what do you do, Xander?

23:52.640 --> 23:54.599
- I'm a doctor.
- Too stressful.

23:54.601 --> 23:57.517
You can get a call and would
have to run off any minute.

23:57.519 --> 23:59.980
You need to go for
something sexier.

24:00.898 --> 24:02.232
- A magician.
- A musician.

24:02.567 --> 24:03.565
Perfect.

24:03.567 --> 24:04.484
Right.

24:04.486 --> 24:05.820
Yeah, a musician, that's better.

24:06.528 --> 24:09.529
So, what do you play?

24:09.531 --> 24:11.114
Music. I play music.

24:11.116 --> 24:14.535
What instrument do you play?

24:14.537 --> 24:15.577
The bass guitar.

24:15.579 --> 24:16.661
Are you in a band?

24:16.663 --> 24:17.537
Oh, yeah.

24:17.539 --> 24:19.125
Yeah, that's why I'm here.

24:20.376 --> 24:21.251
I'm on tour,

24:22.086 --> 24:23.628
and I'm just here for the night.

24:23.630 --> 24:25.462
And am I a groupie
that's stuck in your room?

24:25.464 --> 24:26.756
Yeah.

24:26.758 --> 24:27.759
Yeah, let's go with that.

24:29.719 --> 24:30.551
Still nervous?

24:30.553 --> 24:31.388
No.

25:12.636 --> 25:16.139
Well, I take my
job very seriously.

25:16.141 --> 25:16.975
Oh, yeah.

25:18.351 --> 25:19.477
How much do I owe you?

25:20.310 --> 25:21.768
After sex comes conversation,

25:21.770 --> 25:23.147
you're only halfway done.

25:26.817 --> 25:27.652
Okay.

25:30.613 --> 25:33.324
What
do you wanna talk about?

25:38.829 --> 25:39.955
Tell me about your wife.

25:43.542 --> 25:44.376
My wife?

25:49.465 --> 25:51.342
Rachel's never done
what you just did.

25:52.594 --> 25:54.302
Not many can.

25:54.304 --> 25:56.973
Right.

25:58.974 --> 26:02.728
She's the best person I know.

26:03.813 --> 26:06.358
She cares about
everything and everyone,

26:08.651 --> 26:10.735
even bugs.

26:10.737 --> 26:11.571
Bugs?

26:12.364 --> 26:14.654
Yeah, like spiders and moths.

26:16.241 --> 26:17.784
That's funny.

26:17.786 --> 26:19.744
She'll wake me up in
the middle of the night

26:19.746 --> 26:25.792
and make me help her
take 'em outside.

26:25.794 --> 26:27.000
You know, most would squash 'em,

26:27.002 --> 26:29.754
but not Rachel.

26:29.756 --> 26:31.091
That's so sweet.

26:32.842 --> 26:33.677
Yeah.

26:34.844 --> 26:35.886
Even flies,

26:37.596 --> 26:39.471
I mean who saves flies?

26:39.473 --> 26:40.307
Rachel does.

26:46.897 --> 26:48.482
The truth is that,

26:50.234 --> 26:52.735
well, we've been going through

26:52.737 --> 26:54.948
a little bit of a rough patch.

26:57.409 --> 26:58.699
We actually got married

26:58.701 --> 26:59.827
to get out of the
rough patch, but...

27:05.125 --> 27:06.209
What's the problem?

27:09.378 --> 27:10.212
Me,

27:11.047 --> 27:11.881
I'm the problem.

27:17.345 --> 27:18.346
Elaborate.

27:21.766 --> 27:23.101
I don't know.

27:25.854 --> 27:27.105
It's everything, really.

27:28.897 --> 27:29.982
I bounce from job to job.

27:31.442 --> 27:32.902
I blame her for everything.

27:34.778 --> 27:37.240
I just get so mad,
and I shut down.

27:38.490 --> 27:41.409
Well, that's stupid of you.

27:41.411 --> 27:42.620
I know.

27:43.328 --> 27:45.912
I know, right?

27:45.914 --> 27:47.584
I hate that she paints.

27:49.126 --> 27:50.918
I used to love that about her.

27:52.422 --> 27:54.466
Now, I just fucking hate it.

27:58.219 --> 28:00.180
We don't make each
other happy anymore.

28:02.766 --> 28:07.228
This is the happiest
I've been in a long time,

28:08.063 --> 28:10.938
and it wasn't even with her.

28:10.940 --> 28:13.610
You should do to
her what I did to you.

28:13.942 --> 28:15.278
That'll make her happy.

28:19.281 --> 28:20.366
I need to tell her.

28:21.701 --> 28:22.618
About me?

28:23.452 --> 28:25.413
No, no, God, no.

28:29.041 --> 28:31.543
I need to tell her that
I know what she's doin',

28:32.211 --> 28:34.129
and that it's okay.

28:37.342 --> 28:38.176
Call her.

28:40.135 --> 28:41.385
Call her now and tell her.

28:41.387 --> 28:42.221
No.

28:44.307 --> 28:46.433
I need to tell her in person.

28:47.810 --> 28:50.270
See, she thinks I
don't know, but I do.

28:51.064 --> 28:52.440
The whole office knows.

28:55.652 --> 28:58.321
I need to tell her that I
understand why she's doing it.

28:59.571 --> 29:01.448
You know, that I just
want her to be happy.

29:04.868 --> 29:06.120

I like rap music.

31:46.321 --> 31:47.613
I didn't peg
you for that type.

31:47.615 --> 31:49.116
What type did you peg me for?

31:56.790 --> 31:58.125

32:03.256 --> 32:04.548
It's a goodbye present.

You got kids?

32:13.182 --> 32:14.017
Yeah, two.

32:17.561 --> 32:18.686
I'm just going to
see my daughter,

32:18.688 --> 32:21.355
and she doesn't know...

32:21.357 --> 32:22.733
That you're sick?

32:23.734 --> 32:24.568
Both.

32:29.199 --> 32:30.033

kinds of fathers.

32:34.203 --> 32:35.038
Oh, who knows?

32:35.704 --> 32:36.787
Maybe when I get there,

32:36.789 --> 32:39.834
I'll chicken out again.

32:43.128 --> 32:45.171
Done this trip a
half dozen times now.

32:45.173 --> 32:47.092
Trust me, you should
go through with it.

32:48.759 --> 32:50.010
You won't have another shot.

32:52.221 --> 32:53.638
What makes you say that?

32:53.640 --> 33:03.146
It's the tissue in your
pocket that tells me that.

33:03.148 --> 33:04.608
Well, that's embarrassing.

33:05.818 --> 33:07.151
But you said
you have two kids.

33:07.153 --> 33:09.403
You're gonna see your
daughter, and then?

33:09.405 --> 33:10.365
What about your son?

33:11.324 --> 33:12.701
We no longer talk.

33:16.121 --> 33:20.832
His lifestyle conflicts
with my beliefs.

33:20.834 --> 33:22.124
I've heard this many times,

33:22.126 --> 33:23.250
and I'm gonna give
it to you straight.

33:23.252 --> 33:24.378
You are gonna die soon,

33:27.298 --> 33:28.298
and when you're gone,

33:29.092 --> 33:30.218
you will be forgotten.

33:31.469 --> 33:32.969
If you want to be remembered,

33:32.971 --> 33:34.806
you've got to do something
worth remembering.

33:38.559 --> 33:39.475
Now, go.

33:39.477 --> 33:40.684
Go find a seat over there

33:40.686 --> 33:42.271
and try to appreciate
that rap music.

33:43.480 --> 33:44.646
You don't want me to
sit with you any longer?

33:44.648 --> 33:45.649
It's not personal.

33:46.901 --> 33:48.401
I just don't wanna get
attached to someone

33:48.403 --> 33:49.903
who's going to be dead soon.

33:54.284 --> 33:56.409
Even though Michael
James Lamina's time

33:56.411 --> 33:58.121
on this earth was cut short,

33:59.329 --> 34:01.247
the imprint he left
upon each of our lives

34:01.249 --> 34:02.916
is lasting and deeply felt.

34:04.044 --> 34:05.628
He may have been
outwardly soft-spoken,

34:06.921 --> 34:08.128
but those of us who
knew him can attest

34:08.130 --> 34:10.047
to a bounty of
spirit and generosity

34:10.050 --> 34:12.802
that is exceedingly
rare to this world.

34:43.248 --> 34:44.291
Tragedy, right?

34:45.460 --> 34:47.043
What the fuck
are you doing here?

34:47.045 --> 34:48.335
What are you talking about?

34:48.338 --> 34:49.960
Leave, Caleb. You
shouldn't be here.

34:49.963 --> 34:53.215
I'm not leaving.

34:53.217 --> 34:55.425
Thank you for coming, Caleb.

34:55.427 --> 34:57.763
Michael would have
appreciated you being here.

34:58.639 --> 34:59.473
Rachel.

35:00.474 --> 35:01.308
Let her go.

35:02.434 --> 35:03.266
Thank you.

35:03.268 --> 35:04.520
I'm so sorry.

35:55.155 --> 35:57.657
You know, these
fuckin' suck, dude.

35:59.284 --> 36:00.827
I didn't know him that well.

36:02.036 --> 36:03.788
I can say I worked with
him for a little bit,

36:04.456 --> 36:06.121
seemed nice, though.

36:06.123 --> 36:07.331
Michael was nice, yeah.

36:07.333 --> 36:08.292
It's crazy, right?

36:09.585 --> 36:11.961
I mean, one minute,
you're driving along,

36:11.963 --> 36:14.421
like any other day,

36:14.423 --> 36:15.255
and then bam.

36:15.257 --> 36:16.091
Lights out.

36:16.342 --> 36:18.550
You're fucking dead.

36:18.552 --> 36:19.844
How do you know him?

36:19.846 --> 36:20.889
I'm his wife.

36:21.764 --> 36:22.597
Oh, fuck me.

36:22.599 --> 36:24.807
Oh, I'm so sorry.

36:24.809 --> 36:26.099
It's okay.

36:26.101 --> 36:26.934
No, I shouldn't
have said that.

36:26.936 --> 36:28.144
It's fucking weird.

36:28.146 --> 36:28.978
I shouldn't have
said the "Bam."

36:28.980 --> 36:30.271
I'm fine.

36:30.273 --> 36:31.566
Can I get you anything?

36:32.400 --> 36:33.485
Yeah, actually, some water.

36:34.318 --> 36:35.693
- Okay.
- Yeah.

36:35.695 --> 36:36.528
I'll be back.

36:50.210 --> 36:51.793
- Yeah.
- I know how you feel.

36:51.795 --> 36:52.628
Excuse me.

36:54.088 --> 36:56.007
I'm gonna be in the bathroom
for a little bit, okay?

36:56.507 --> 36:57.341
No, why?

36:58.175 --> 36:59.008
The dead guy's wife,

36:59.010 --> 36:59.844
she's havin' a meltdown.

37:00.512 --> 37:01.385
I'll take care of her.

37:01.387 --> 37:02.220
She's my friend.

37:02.222 --> 37:03.512
No, it's okay.

37:03.514 --> 37:04.805
I got it. I just came out
to get her some water.

37:04.807 --> 37:05.764
- I don't mind.
- Just let her go.

37:05.766 --> 37:07.057
She's a bartender.

37:07.059 --> 37:08.728
She's great with
depressed people.

37:10.021 --> 37:11.436
Just remember I need
the car later on.

37:11.438 --> 37:12.271
I work at three.

37:12.273 --> 37:13.481
I know. I gotta drop you off,

37:13.483 --> 37:15.858
'cause I gotta pick
up Freddie at four.

37:15.860 --> 37:17.150
Remember?

37:17.152 --> 37:18.485
Okay, well, if I'm
not out in 30 minutes,

37:18.487 --> 37:19.321
I'll find a ride.

37:20.407 --> 37:23.532
30 minutes?

37:23.534 --> 37:24.368
Okay, sure.

37:26.538 --> 37:27.371
Your wife?

37:27.831 --> 37:28.664
Fiancé.

37:34.586 --> 37:37.257
Hello?

37:39.342 --> 37:40.633
Fuckin' sucks, right?

37:40.635 --> 37:41.469
What?

37:42.387 --> 37:44.345
That dude, Michael.

37:44.347 --> 37:45.387
I didn't really know him,

37:45.389 --> 37:47.433
but to die like that.

37:48.393 --> 37:49.561
I wonder if he felt it.

37:50.478 --> 37:51.311
Well, I hope not.

37:52.105 --> 37:53.021
Well, I hope not, too,

37:53.023 --> 37:54.941
but you gotta wonder, right?

37:56.568 --> 37:58.194
His poor wife, man.

37:59.028 --> 38:01.737
Don't feel too bad for her.

38:01.739 --> 38:02.572
Are you kidding?

38:02.574 --> 38:03.990
Her husband just died.

38:03.992 --> 38:05.950
I know, but she
wasn't exactly known

38:05.952 --> 38:06.911
for being the best wife.

38:07.579 --> 38:09.287
So the fuck what?

38:09.289 --> 38:10.498
Look, what I'm saying is

38:12.208 --> 38:14.210
she won't be hurting
for male attention,

38:15.085 --> 38:16.336
because when they were married,

38:16.338 --> 38:18.003
she wasn't hurting
for it either.

38:18.005 --> 38:19.463
You're saying she
was having an affair?

38:19.465 --> 38:20.505
Yeah.

38:20.507 --> 38:21.548
With who?

38:21.550 --> 38:23.717
Remember the guy
that I was talkin' to

38:23.719 --> 38:25.179
when you came to
get a water for her?

38:25.512 --> 38:26.512
No.

38:26.514 --> 38:27.347
Yeah.

38:27.349 --> 38:28.182
That's not funny.

38:29.726 --> 38:31.936
Someone died. It's
still a tragedy.

38:32.896 --> 38:35.354
Yeah, I know, I'm just sayin',

38:35.356 --> 38:36.190
she's no angel, all right?

38:37.525 --> 38:39.108
Maybe she had her reasons,

38:39.110 --> 38:40.650
I mean, we don't know what
their lives were like.

38:40.652 --> 38:42.321
She had a reason to cheat?

38:43.572 --> 38:45.490
What's a reason to
fuck someone else?

38:45.492 --> 38:46.368
Oh, no.

38:47.827 --> 38:49.077
Oh, no, no, what's a
reason to fuck someone else?

38:49.079 --> 38:49.911
That is not what I
meant, and you know it.

38:49.913 --> 38:50.744
Come on, come on.

38:50.746 --> 38:51.662
I want you to tell me, right,

38:51.664 --> 38:52.871
we're gettin' married in a week,

38:52.873 --> 38:54.374
so I'd love to
know what validates

38:54.376 --> 38:56.169
someone to have an affair.

38:57.170 --> 38:58.418
You're being an asshole.

38:58.420 --> 38:59.422
I'm being an
asshole? Fuck you.

39:01.007 --> 39:05.427
What if I make you upset or
spend too much time at work?

39:07.012 --> 39:08.637
So, then it's okay for you
to go and have an affair?

39:08.639 --> 39:09.930
Can we just be sad for
a second that someone died

39:09.932 --> 39:10.889
and not make it about you?

39:10.891 --> 39:11.725
Can we do that?

39:13.186 --> 39:14.771
It's just great to know
that some affairs are a-okay.

39:18.148 --> 39:19.025
Come on, man.

39:20.527 --> 39:21.943
I don't even know why
we're fighting right now.

39:21.945 --> 39:23.695
Because you find nothing
wrong with the fact that...

39:23.697 --> 39:25.195
Of course it's wrong, okay?

39:25.197 --> 39:29.450
All I said was that it's fuckin'
sad that her husband died.

39:29.452 --> 39:31.911
You know what? I'm not
talkin' to you anymore.

39:31.913 --> 39:32.994
Good.

39:32.996 --> 39:34.246
- Just drop me off.
- Okay.

39:34.248 --> 39:57.019

your stupid friend.

41:58.726 --> 42:00.019
How dare you come here.

42:00.853 --> 42:01.980
How dare I come here?

42:02.688 --> 42:03.646
Well, what do you mean?

42:03.648 --> 42:04.691
I'm always here.

42:05.650 --> 42:07.233
You're disgusting.

42:07.235 --> 42:08.486
I'm disgusting? Okay.

42:10.112 --> 42:10.945
Well, okay, I'm disgusting.

42:10.947 --> 42:12.155
So, what about you?

42:12.157 --> 42:13.240
I'm worse,

42:14.074 --> 42:14.992
but you were his best friend.

42:16.869 --> 42:17.703
Don't.

42:18.579 --> 42:19.494
Don't do this, okay?

42:19.496 --> 42:21.079
Don't do what?

42:21.081 --> 42:21.915
The right thing?

42:22.751 --> 42:23.585
What makes it right? What?

42:24.168 --> 42:25.001
Huh?

42:25.003 --> 42:25.836
Because he's dead?

42:26.963 --> 42:29.005
Come on, baby. It's
not our fault he died.

42:29.007 --> 42:29.965
Yes it is.

42:30.717 --> 42:31.550
We did this.

42:32.302 --> 42:33.592
We wanted him gone, remember?

42:33.594 --> 42:34.552
Out of the picture so
we could be together,

42:34.554 --> 42:35.385
not dead.

42:35.387 --> 42:37.679
We're horrible.

42:37.681 --> 42:38.514
Hey.

42:38.516 --> 42:39.351
And what?

42:40.934 --> 42:42.436
- Come on.
- You come here?

42:43.646 --> 42:44.481
Why?

42:45.690 --> 42:46.900
To fuck me, Caleb?

42:48.650 --> 42:50.233
- Don't.
- He ain't comin' home, right?

42:50.235 --> 42:51.526
He won't catch us.

42:51.528 --> 42:52.820
Hey, hey, don't
say that, okay?

42:52.822 --> 42:53.698
No more sneaking
behind his back.

42:54.907 --> 42:57.657
- Hey, stop.
- You want me all to yourself.

42:57.659 --> 42:58.492
That's what you
always wanted, huh?

42:58.494 --> 42:59.327
Stop.

42:59.329 --> 43:00.202
That's what you always wanted.

43:00.204 --> 43:02.039
- Stop!
- Stop what?

43:02.831 --> 43:04.248
Stop this!

43:04.250 --> 43:05.833
I don't know whatever the
fuck this is, okay? Stop it.

43:05.835 --> 43:06.920
Black paintings, whatever
this is, just stop.

43:07.795 --> 43:09.172
You're killing the animals.

43:11.048 --> 43:12.882
I don't want you to
go through this alone.

43:12.884 --> 43:14.177
That's it, honey, okay?

43:15.094 --> 43:16.428
- Can we just...
- I hate you.

43:17.262 --> 43:18.679
I love you. Don't say that.

43:18.681 --> 43:19.764
- I hate everything about us.
- That's not true.

43:19.766 --> 43:24.226
- Everything about us.
- Come on.

43:24.228 --> 43:25.355
Michael trusted you.

43:26.563 --> 43:28.523
Fuck, what do
you want me to do?

43:28.525 --> 43:30.735
I'll do it, tell me. What
do you want me to do?

43:31.902 --> 43:33.153
You're glad he's dead.

43:34.114 --> 43:36.572
How can you fucking say that?

43:36.574 --> 43:37.409
You are,

43:38.159 --> 43:40.494
and maybe, somewhere I am, too.

43:41.829 --> 43:43.787
- That's not true.
- And I hate myself for that.

43:43.789 --> 43:46.666
- I hate myself for that.
- Don't say that.

43:46.668 --> 43:47.583
We loved Michael.

43:47.585 --> 43:49.584
WE loved him, and he loved us.

43:49.586 --> 43:50.755
He didn't know about us.

43:51.672 --> 43:53.005
Yeah, I know that,

43:53.007 --> 43:55.800
and that we have to live with
for the rest of our lives,

43:55.802 --> 43:59.929
but it doesn't change
how I feel about you.

43:59.931 --> 44:01.266
Rachel, just look at me.

44:07.021 --> 44:07.855
Hey.

44:11.525 --> 44:14.903
You know what cuts
my insides up the most?

44:16.780 --> 44:18.740
It's that the best memories

44:18.742 --> 44:21.369
I had while being married
to him weren't with him.

44:22.327 --> 44:23.246
They were with you.

44:25.414 --> 44:26.539
You ruined my memories.

44:26.541 --> 44:28.460
You ruined my memories!

44:29.710 --> 44:30.793
You
ruined everything.

44:30.795 --> 44:31.671
Hey, that doesn't
fuckin' make sense.

44:32.755 --> 44:33.588
You lost Michael, not me,

44:33.590 --> 44:35.008
so don't shut me out.

44:38.510 --> 44:39.346
Leave.

44:40.137 --> 44:41.181
Leave or I'll call the police.

44:42.349 --> 44:43.514
Call the police,
fuck it, I don't care.

44:43.516 --> 44:44.891
Oh yeah?

44:44.893 --> 44:46.184
You wanna call the police,
go ahead, call the police.

44:46.186 --> 44:47.769
Okay, I'll call
the fuckin' police.

44:47.771 --> 44:48.978
If that's how I get to
talk to you, then call them.

44:48.980 --> 44:50.273
Fuck it. I don't
care who's listening.

44:50.940 --> 44:52.023
You know what I'll do?

44:52.025 --> 44:53.401
I'll call Eileen.

44:54.652 --> 44:57.362
I'll tell Eileen that
her son's best friend

44:57.364 --> 44:59.240
was secretly fucking his wife.

44:59.907 --> 45:00.822
That will kill her.

45:00.824 --> 45:02.032
Is that what you want now?

45:02.034 --> 45:03.242
Is that what you
want, to hurt someone?

45:03.244 --> 45:04.079
Why not?

45:04.621 --> 45:05.454
I hurt.

45:06.246 --> 45:07.496
Hey.

45:07.498 --> 45:08.831
And I'm horrible
just like you.

45:08.833 --> 45:10.085
Don't say that.
Give me the phone.

45:10.793 --> 45:11.958
Leave.

45:11.960 --> 45:12.795
- Come on.
- I'm dialing.

45:13.505 --> 45:14.336
I'm done.

45:15.172 --> 45:16.006
Okay, fine, you win.

45:18.802 --> 45:19.635
I'll leave.

45:24.306 --> 45:25.808
And don't ever come back here.

45:26.768 --> 45:28.434
Whatever we had,

45:28.436 --> 45:29.269
it's dead,

45:30.688 --> 45:33.523
just like Michael and all
these fucking animals.

45:33.525 --> 45:35.273
I love you, Rachel.

45:35.275 --> 45:36.110
Fuck.

45:50.833 --> 45:51.667
Come in.

45:52.460 --> 45:54.543
You can set that anywhere.

45:54.545 --> 45:57.338
Look at this place.

45:57.340 --> 45:58.798
You're all domesticated now.

46:00.050 --> 46:02.177
I know. We even use
coasters. Can you believe it?

46:03.054 --> 46:03.887
Damn.

46:05.472 --> 46:07.724
Well, where is she?

46:07.726 --> 46:08.768
She's at work.

46:10.353 --> 46:11.894
I'm startin' to believe
she might not be real.

46:11.896 --> 46:13.146
People do that, you know,
make up girlfriends,

46:13.148 --> 46:14.646
so they don't get
all lonely and shit.

46:14.648 --> 46:16.773
Come on, you've seen
pictures. You know she's real.

46:16.775 --> 46:18.025
Photoshop, bro.

46:18.027 --> 46:18.944
For all I know,
she's really a cat.

46:19.945 --> 46:21.114
Here, kitty, kitty.

46:21.947 --> 46:23.447
20 minutes off the plane,

46:23.449 --> 46:24.532
and you're already searchin'
for pussy. Come on.

46:27.829 --> 46:28.827
I gotta get my ass
in the shower, first.

46:28.829 --> 46:29.913
I smell like a fat Texan.

46:31.123 --> 46:32.664
You seriously gonna
make me drink alone?

46:32.666 --> 46:33.958
The guy I sat next to

46:33.960 --> 46:46.095
actually had bacon
strips for a snack.

46:58.150 --> 46:59.150
Well, did you see who did it?

46:59.152 --> 47:00.985
No, it was like a drive by.

47:00.987 --> 47:02.278
They just unloaded on us,

47:02.280 --> 47:03.653
like dun dun dun dun dun.

47:05.115 --> 47:06.532
It's not funny.

47:06.534 --> 47:07.450
I'm sorry.

47:07.452 --> 47:08.617
It's funny. It's a little funny.

47:08.619 --> 47:09.871
Do you think that's funny?

47:11.373 --> 47:12.204
I wasn't listening.

47:12.206 --> 47:13.290
I got egged.

47:14.501 --> 47:15.752
Somebody egged me. Is
that funny or not funny?

47:17.795 --> 47:19.086
Yeah, see, not funny.

47:19.088 --> 47:20.170
Okay, okay, I will
get you a new shirt,

47:20.172 --> 47:21.838
but you're gonna have
to wait until I'm off.

47:21.840 --> 47:23.383
No, no, no, I'm working.
I gotta go back right now.

47:23.385 --> 47:27.220
Then, the yolk's
on you.

47:27.222 --> 47:28.181
Again, not funny.

47:29.099 --> 47:30.472
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

47:30.474 --> 47:31.601
I just can't use my discount
until I'm clocked outta here.

47:32.811 --> 47:33.726
Okay, I guess I'll
just have to work

47:33.728 --> 47:34.936
these eggs into my set somehow.

47:34.938 --> 47:37.063
Yeah, egg-zactly.

47:37.065 --> 47:38.566
All right, omelet
you get back to work.

47:39.775 --> 47:40.733
Hey, there's that
big polar bear I love.

47:40.735 --> 47:42.943
- Come here.
- All right.

47:42.945 --> 47:43.985
See you at home.

47:43.987 --> 47:45.905
- Love you. See you.
- Bye.

47:45.907 --> 47:46.740
Sorry, I can help you now.

47:47.492 --> 47:48.950
I wanna sell all of this.

47:48.952 --> 47:51.077
Okay, cool, have
you been here before?

47:51.079 --> 47:51.913
No.

47:52.956 --> 47:53.787
All right, so how it works...

47:53.789 --> 47:54.956
I know how it works.

47:54.958 --> 47:56.584
Just give me whatever
you can for this.

47:58.085 --> 47:58.919
Right on.

48:03.465 --> 48:06.844
Nice jacket, but paint stains.

48:07.637 --> 48:08.471
Can we just get this done?

48:15.769 --> 48:18.355
You cleaning out your closets?

48:24.028 --> 48:26.737
You know, after a breakup,
emotions are usually soaring.

48:26.739 --> 48:28.613
Maybe you wanna hold
onto a few of his things,

48:28.615 --> 48:30.992
in case things get better.

48:30.994 --> 48:32.325
He's probably gonna
be pretty pissed off

48:32.327 --> 48:33.244
when he finds out all
his clothes are gone.

48:33.246 --> 48:36.371
He's not gonna find out.

48:36.373 --> 48:37.207
Oh.

48:37.708 --> 48:38.542
Okay.

48:39.418 --> 48:40.751
Well, then in that case,

48:40.753 --> 48:43.547
I am going to keep this
shirt for my boyfriend.

50:41.331 --> 50:45.751
Ooh.

50:45.753 --> 50:46.920
It's been years,

50:48.130 --> 50:51.884
well, a lifetime since
I've kissed Mary.

50:53.844 --> 50:58.514
She's a wonderful kisser.

50:58.516 --> 50:59.351
Yes.

51:00.351 --> 51:01.268
Yes, she is.

51:02.394 --> 51:03.226
What's your name?

51:03.228 --> 51:04.355
Jimmie.

51:05.315 --> 51:06.566
With an IE, no Y.

51:08.233 --> 51:09.275
Why?

51:09.277 --> 51:10.110
No "Y."

51:10.570 --> 51:11.613
I mean, no Y,

51:12.280 --> 51:15.030
with an IE at the end.

51:15.032 --> 51:16.076
Jimmie with an IE in the end?

51:16.742 --> 51:17.576
I see.

51:18.202 --> 51:19.119
Do you like birds?

51:22.164 --> 51:23.833
Living the way that I do,

51:25.251 --> 51:26.086
where I do,

51:27.336 --> 51:34.800
I have grown so very fond
of our feathered friends

51:34.802 --> 51:37.804
Do a lot of ducks
pass through this alley?

51:37.806 --> 51:38.639
Just this one here.

51:43.436 --> 51:45.436
You know you're
very sick, right?

51:45.438 --> 51:46.314
Only physically.

51:48.440 --> 51:50.609
- Are you afraid?
- No.

51:51.735 --> 51:55.362
I've been to much worse
places in my time.

51:55.364 --> 51:58.617
A vacation sounds
pretty good right now.

51:59.327 --> 52:00.492
Why, should I be scared?

52:00.494 --> 52:01.704
You, no way.

52:02.246 --> 52:03.787
No.

52:03.789 --> 52:04.958
No? Good,

52:06.291 --> 52:10.922
because I've never been
too good at being scared.

52:15.342 --> 52:16.927
You are beautiful.

52:21.641 --> 52:22.724
I'll see you again.

52:22.726 --> 52:23.977
- Yeah.
- Soon.

52:25.353 --> 52:26.813
- Very soon.
- Real soon.

52:27.480 --> 52:28.565

52:53.590 --> 52:58.303

53:03.474 --> 53:05.101
What can I get you?

53:06.061 --> 53:09.311
A scotch, neat.

53:09.313 --> 53:10.147
Thank you.

53:17.072 --> 53:18.320
Had a long day?

53:18.322 --> 53:20.072
Shitty day.

53:20.074 --> 53:22.367
Ever have those kind of days?

53:22.369 --> 53:24.412
At my age, every
day's a shitty day.

53:25.246 --> 53:26.081
Well, that's just sad.

53:29.708 --> 53:32.418
- Is it your birthday?
- Huh?

53:32.420 --> 53:33.253
No, no, no, no.

53:35.422 --> 53:36.256
It's for my daughter.

53:37.050 --> 53:37.884
That's sweet,

53:38.677 --> 53:40.679
but why are you here at a bar?

53:41.512 --> 53:43.139
Liquid courage, I guess.

53:44.349 --> 53:46.057
Your daughter's
that scary, huh?

53:46.059 --> 53:46.935
In town to surprise her.

53:48.143 --> 53:49.851
She doesn't know
you're in town?

53:49.853 --> 53:52.104
She doesn't even know me.

53:52.106 --> 53:52.940
How's that for a surprise?

53:54.358 --> 53:55.735
So, you're here to play
it all out in your head

53:56.402 --> 53:57.693
before you go see her?

53:57.695 --> 53:58.610
Yeah, somethin'
like that, I guess.

53:58.612 --> 53:59.446
Well, good luck with that.

54:00.532 --> 54:02.200
Hey, can I ask you somethin'?

54:03.867 --> 54:06.744
Would you be angry
if some sick old man

54:06.746 --> 54:08.246
showed up at your doorstep

54:08.248 --> 54:11.126
and started telling you
that he was your dad?

54:12.376 --> 54:13.709
Well, only if you
followed it up with,

54:13.711 --> 54:16.838
"Can I borrow some money?"

54:16.840 --> 54:18.171
No, no money,

54:18.173 --> 54:22.512
just what if he just
wanted to meet you?

54:24.389 --> 54:25.222
Couldn't say.

54:26.349 --> 54:28.557
The conversation
gettin' too close for ya?

54:28.559 --> 54:32.478
No, my dad is,

54:32.480 --> 54:34.021
he passed away.

54:34.023 --> 54:34.857
Oh.

54:36.025 --> 54:37.652
But when he was alive,
he was my everything.

54:38.485 --> 54:40.820
I'm sorry.

54:40.822 --> 54:42.240
Don't feel sorry for me.

54:43.074 --> 54:44.159
Feel sorry for your daughter.

54:44.992 --> 54:47.242
Ouch. I guess I deserved that.

54:47.244 --> 54:48.328
What I mean is

54:49.539 --> 54:51.666
a lot of kids don't
get to see their dads,

54:52.583 --> 54:53.541
but I work in a bar.

54:53.543 --> 54:55.295
I get to see their
dads every day.

54:56.211 --> 54:57.172
Isn't that fucked up?

54:58.380 --> 55:02.634
So, that doesn't make me
that rare of an asshole, right?

55:04.179 --> 55:06.181
You wanna know the one thing
that you all have in common?

55:07.389 --> 55:08.472
Why not kick me
while I'm down?

55:08.474 --> 55:11.143
You all wish you did
something differently.

55:12.853 --> 55:13.687
Weird, huh?

55:15.148 --> 55:18.318
Yeah, well, that's why
I'm here, to tell her that.

55:19.402 --> 55:21.278
Why now after all these years?

55:22.489 --> 55:24.115
She doesn't know she
has a brother here.

55:24.949 --> 55:26.032
I kept my lives separated.

55:26.034 --> 55:27.911
I regret that now,

55:30.079 --> 55:32.331
but she deserves to know.

55:33.458 --> 55:34.956
Is that proof enough
I'm a monster?

55:34.958 --> 55:36.043
Monster? No.

55:36.543 --> 55:38.003
Coward? Yeah.

55:38.588 --> 55:39.422
Oh.

55:40.005 --> 55:41.257
But you're here.

55:42.175 --> 55:43.009
You're alive.

55:43.635 --> 55:44.508
I say go tell her.

55:44.510 --> 55:45.760
Go out with a bang.

55:45.762 --> 55:47.055
She'll hate me.

55:47.889 --> 55:49.307
She probably already does.

55:50.684 --> 55:51.518
I would.

55:54.103 --> 55:55.644
I don't expect
her to forgive me.

55:55.646 --> 55:58.481
I just want to,

55:58.483 --> 55:59.484
I don't know, apologize.

56:00.568 --> 56:01.983
Now, how the hell do I do that?

56:01.985 --> 56:03.568
I'm just a bartender, but
I'd start with, "I'm sorry."

56:03.570 --> 56:07.282
Wouldn't you want
more than two words?

56:08.117 --> 56:09.325
Well, it's two more words

56:09.327 --> 56:11.287
than she's ever gotten
from you, right?

56:12.121 --> 56:13.496
It's a pretty good start.

56:13.498 --> 56:15.498
I don't know, maybe she's
better off just the way it is.

56:15.500 --> 56:18.291
Look, it's really
not a big deal.

56:18.293 --> 56:19.128
People know people fuck up.

56:19.461 --> 56:20.461
I fuck up.

56:20.463 --> 56:21.295
You definitely fuck up.

56:21.297 --> 56:22.463
We all fuck up.

56:22.465 --> 56:25.675
We're only fuck-ups if
we don't learn from it,

56:25.677 --> 56:27.760

Hey, I said you

57:16.728 --> 57:17.686
My husband just died.

57:18.521 --> 57:19.856
Did he die from the smoking?

57:23.275 --> 57:24.777
No, I killed him.

59:39.454 --> 59:40.497
Cigarettes, no.

59:41.748 --> 59:42.914
Shit, she gets high, too?

59:42.916 --> 59:44.042
Sometimes.

59:45.793 --> 59:47.420
Freddie, I gotta
ask you somethin'.

59:48.630 --> 59:49.670
I didn't
use your shampoo, man.

59:49.672 --> 59:50.921
I know how you are
with that shit.

59:50.923 --> 59:52.882
Shut the fuck up.

59:52.884 --> 59:54.260
No, I need a favor.

59:56.471 --> 59:57.472
How much you need?

59:58.306 --> 59:59.597
I don't need money, okay?

59:59.599 --> 01:00:00.889
I just need you to
do something for me.

01:00:00.891 --> 01:00:02.391
Will you just
ask already, man?

01:00:02.393 --> 01:00:03.476
You're killin' my high.

01:00:03.478 --> 01:00:04.311
Okay.

01:00:05.813 --> 01:00:07.438
I'm about to get married, okay?

01:00:07.440 --> 01:00:09.943
I'm about to commit myself to
the same girl for the next,

01:00:10.527 --> 01:00:11.360
forever.

01:00:12.445 --> 01:00:13.360
I can't
help you out there.

01:00:13.362 --> 01:00:14.196
I can't marry her for you.

01:00:14.697 --> 01:00:15.531
Before I do,

01:00:16.907 --> 01:00:17.741
I need to know.

01:00:18.367 --> 01:00:19.284
Need to know what?

01:00:20.161 --> 01:00:21.079
If she's the one.

01:00:22.288 --> 01:00:23.621
You don't know
if she's the one?

01:00:23.623 --> 01:00:25.541
I think I do, but I
need to know for sure.

01:00:27.001 --> 01:00:28.460
What are you askin', man?

01:00:29.838 --> 01:00:31.423
She's never met you, right?

01:00:31.755 --> 01:00:33.005
Yeah?

01:00:33.007 --> 01:00:35.465
So, if you were to
randomly meet her, okay,

01:00:35.467 --> 01:00:37.175
and I don't know,

01:00:37.177 --> 01:00:39.762
just be all charming,

01:00:39.764 --> 01:00:41.349
do whatever it is that you do.

01:00:42.726 --> 01:00:44.141
- I need to know if she'd...
- If she'd what?

01:00:44.143 --> 01:00:44.977
She'd do it.

01:00:46.311 --> 01:00:48.229
You want me to hook
up with your fiance?

01:00:48.231 --> 01:00:49.149
No, no, I mean,

01:00:50.733 --> 01:00:52.108
well, I want you to try
to hook up with my fiance.

01:00:52.110 --> 01:00:54.568
You know, most guys would
frown on their friends

01:00:54.570 --> 01:00:55.737
goin' after their girl, right?

01:00:55.739 --> 01:00:57.070
I know, Freddie, but listen,

01:00:57.072 --> 01:00:59.451
you know, you got a
way with girls, okay?

01:00:59.992 --> 01:01:01.575
They love you.

01:01:01.577 --> 01:01:03.911
So, she turns you down,

01:01:03.913 --> 01:01:04.831
then I know for sure
that she'd never cheat.

01:01:07.541 --> 01:01:08.999
You're just
trippin' right now.

01:01:09.001 --> 01:01:10.336
That's just normal.

01:01:11.545 --> 01:01:12.461
It's cold feet.
That's all it is.

01:01:12.463 --> 01:01:13.297
No, no, no, no.

01:01:13.922 --> 01:01:14.757
I'm not trippin', okay?

01:01:16.467 --> 01:01:19.511
I'm perfectly aware what
I'm asking, all right?

01:01:20.722 --> 01:01:21.848
I've been thinkin' about
this for a long time.

01:01:23.141 --> 01:01:24.682
So, don't chalk it up
to me bein' scared,

01:01:24.684 --> 01:01:25.769
'cause I'm not scared.

01:01:29.356 --> 01:01:30.190
Luke,

01:01:31.733 --> 01:01:32.817
do you realize what you're
asking me to do right now?

01:01:34.235 --> 01:01:35.068
Will you do it?

01:01:35.070 --> 01:01:36.318
No, for many reasons.

01:01:36.320 --> 01:01:37.947
One, because it's
fucking stupid.

01:01:39.157 --> 01:01:40.947
Two, because if me and
her did hit it off,

01:01:40.949 --> 01:01:41.782
you'd not only hate her.

01:01:41.784 --> 01:01:42.618
You'd hate me, too.

01:01:43.869 --> 01:01:45.994
And three, because I'm
going to your wedding.

01:01:45.996 --> 01:01:47.914
It might be a bit awkward when
she sees me standin' by you

01:01:47.916 --> 01:01:50.124
on the happiest day of her life.

01:01:50.126 --> 01:01:52.043
Okay.

01:01:52.045 --> 01:01:53.001
I forget what one was,

01:01:53.003 --> 01:01:54.545
but two, I wouldn't hate you.

01:01:54.547 --> 01:01:55.382
I swear to God.

01:01:56.257 --> 01:01:57.590
I wouldn't even hate her,

01:01:57.592 --> 01:01:58.885
I'd just know that
she wasn't the one.

01:01:59.844 --> 01:02:00.679
Three, if she does it,

01:02:01.679 --> 01:02:02.804
then the wedding's off, okay?

01:02:02.806 --> 01:02:03.887
Problem solved.

01:02:03.889 --> 01:02:05.889
Can't you ask
someone else to do it?

01:02:05.891 --> 01:02:07.268
She knows all my friends,

01:02:08.311 --> 01:02:09.144
and besides,

01:02:10.021 --> 01:02:10.853
look at you, Freddie.

01:02:10.855 --> 01:02:11.690
I mean,

01:02:12.523 --> 01:02:13.438
you're a specimen.

01:02:13.440 --> 01:02:14.608
You're carved from stone.

01:02:16.402 --> 01:02:20.237
That's why you invited
me here, isn't it?

01:02:20.239 --> 01:02:21.280
- No.
- It is.

01:02:21.282 --> 01:02:23.284
- No.
- It is, you fucker!

01:02:23.952 --> 01:02:25.242
You know, I'll admit,

01:02:25.244 --> 01:02:26.869
I was a bit surprised
when you invited me,

01:02:26.871 --> 01:02:28.871
because we're not
exactly close anymore,

01:02:28.873 --> 01:02:29.871
but now it all makes sense.

01:02:29.873 --> 01:02:30.956
I got no one
else to ask, okay?

01:02:30.958 --> 01:02:31.999
And I can see why,

01:02:32.001 --> 01:02:32.833
you just use people.

01:02:32.835 --> 01:02:34.545
Use people? Fuck you.

01:02:35.463 --> 01:02:36.295
All right?

01:02:36.297 --> 01:02:37.505
You should be flattered.

01:02:37.507 --> 01:02:38.800
This is my life
we're talkin' about.

01:02:39.717 --> 01:02:40.550
I'm not doin' this.

01:02:40.552 --> 01:02:41.594
I'm sorry.

01:02:42.804 --> 01:02:45.557
Hey, hey, hey,
you owe me, okay?

01:02:46.724 --> 01:02:48.851
You owe me. I need
you to do this for me.

01:02:50.061 --> 01:02:50.976
Luke, this won't
solve anything.

01:02:50.978 --> 01:02:51.978
No matter how it turns out,

01:02:51.980 --> 01:02:52.894
it's bad on all sides.

01:02:52.896 --> 01:02:54.063
I don't need your opinion,

01:02:54.065 --> 01:02:56.941
I just need you to do one thing,

01:02:56.943 --> 01:02:58.608
and then you can fuck
off back to New York

01:02:58.610 --> 01:03:00.571
and do whatever the fuck it
is that you do all day long.

01:03:01.280 --> 01:03:02.740
Look, I love her.

01:03:05.242 --> 01:03:06.577
I'm gonna marry this girl,

01:03:08.246 --> 01:03:09.164
and I'm askin' you.

01:03:10.414 --> 01:03:11.621
I'm begging you,

up to the plate

01:03:20.175 --> 01:03:22.135

01:03:23.260 --> 01:03:25.054
This is the only
thing I've ever asked.

01:03:26.181 --> 01:03:27.389
You really need this?

01:03:29.099 --> 01:03:29.933

Why wasn't I saved?

01:04:36.041 --> 01:04:37.501
I'm about to prevent a death.

01:04:38.003 --> 01:04:39.170
That is my job.

01:04:40.045 --> 01:04:41.920
Why wasn't my death prevented?

01:04:41.922 --> 01:04:44.298
We tried.

01:04:44.300 --> 01:04:46.302
Do you know how many
people die every day?

01:04:47.177 --> 01:04:49.431
- How many?
- 150,000,

01:04:50.931 --> 01:04:52.391
every day.

01:04:56.061 --> 01:04:57.311
For some of them,
it's their time,

01:04:57.313 --> 01:04:59.523
and for some innocent
people like you,

01:05:01.067 --> 01:05:03.608
it's not.

01:05:03.610 --> 01:05:05.653
It is a difficult
job we're doing

01:05:05.655 --> 01:05:07.865
in a very complicated world.

01:05:11.619 --> 01:05:13.246
I wish we could have saved you,

01:05:14.329 --> 01:05:15.581
save people like you,

01:05:16.666 --> 01:05:20.168
but we can't save 'em all.

01:05:20.170 --> 01:05:21.084
So, it wasn't my time?

01:05:21.086 --> 01:05:24.215
No, but yes, it still happens.

01:05:25.050 --> 01:05:26.259
And it isn't Rachel's time,

01:05:27.092 --> 01:05:28.177
but if I fail,

01:05:29.137 --> 01:05:29.971
she dies?

01:05:30.679 --> 01:05:31.806
If you fail,

01:05:32.514 --> 01:05:33.349
yes.

01:05:34.351 --> 01:05:35.184
She will die.

01:05:37.186 --> 01:05:38.896
Is that why you wanted to walk,

01:05:40.106 --> 01:05:41.149
questioning your job?

01:05:43.233 --> 01:05:44.235
She wants to die.

01:05:46.070 --> 01:05:47.778
Why can't I save someone
that wants to live?

01:05:47.780 --> 01:05:49.488
We cannot do that.

01:05:49.490 --> 01:05:52.200
We can only influence,
offer another option.

01:05:52.202 --> 01:05:53.286
That's all.

01:05:54.746 --> 01:05:56.244
Right now, Rachel doesn't
see another option.

01:05:56.246 --> 01:05:57.871
That's why you are here.

01:05:57.873 --> 01:06:13.679
We're here.

01:06:13.681 --> 01:06:14.515
Who are you?

01:06:15.141 --> 01:06:16.057
You know who I am.

01:06:16.059 --> 01:06:16.893
No, I don't.

01:06:17.686 --> 01:06:18.687
What are you doing in my house?

01:06:19.521 --> 01:06:20.355
You called me.

01:06:22.065 --> 01:06:24.148
Layla from the matches?

01:06:24.150 --> 01:06:26.275
That's right.

01:06:26.277 --> 01:06:27.153
How did you find me?

01:06:29.030 --> 01:06:29.864
It's what I do.

01:06:30.657 --> 01:06:33.157
I find people who are lost.

01:06:33.159 --> 01:06:35.659
I don't even know
what that means.

01:06:35.661 --> 01:06:36.495
Please leave.

01:06:37.204 --> 01:06:39.246
I'm not leaving, Rachel.

01:06:39.248 --> 01:06:42.083
We still have unfinished
business together.

01:06:42.085 --> 01:06:43.126
What are you talking about?

01:06:43.128 --> 01:06:44.129
You know what
I'm talking about.

01:06:45.380 --> 01:06:47.880
After all, it was
you who called me.

01:06:47.882 --> 01:06:48.842
What do you want?

01:06:49.342 --> 01:06:50.175
Nothing.

01:06:51.302 --> 01:06:53.219
I just saw your number
on a pack of matches,

01:06:53.221 --> 01:06:56.266
and I was curious to know
how you knew Michael.

01:06:57.391 --> 01:07:04.688
Michael, such a quiet man.

01:07:04.690 --> 01:07:05.524
May I?

01:07:08.402 --> 01:07:09.236
Where was I?

01:07:09.862 --> 01:07:10.696
How you knew Michael.

01:07:11.447 --> 01:07:12.614
Oh, that's right.

01:07:13.615 --> 01:07:17.452
Well, we spent his last
night on earth together.

01:07:17.454 --> 01:07:20.037
- Excuse me?
- We spent his last night...

01:07:20.039 --> 01:07:21.121
No, I heard what you said,

01:07:21.123 --> 01:07:23.708
but you're gonna have
to elaborate on that.

01:07:23.710 --> 01:07:24.543
You want details?

01:07:24.918 --> 01:07:25.753
Yes.

01:07:26.755 --> 01:07:28.045
Are you sure? I can
be quite descriptive.

01:07:28.047 --> 01:07:28.881
Tell me.

01:07:29.173 --> 01:07:30.005
Okay.

01:07:30.007 --> 01:07:30.841
We met at a bar,

01:07:31.885 --> 01:07:33.925
and then took me back
to his hotel room.

01:07:33.927 --> 01:07:34.971
I took him.

01:07:36.222 --> 01:07:37.512
You know Michael, he could
be rather flat-footed

01:07:37.514 --> 01:07:39.599
when it comes to
making decisions.

01:07:39.601 --> 01:07:40.599
Go on.

01:07:40.601 --> 01:07:42.978
After that, we
had amazing sex.

01:07:46.148 --> 01:07:47.065
You want positions?

01:07:47.067 --> 01:07:48.443
You know I'm his wife, right?

01:07:49.235 --> 01:07:50.070
Of course, I do.

01:07:51.028 --> 01:07:54.363
After we had sex, he
told me all about you.

01:07:54.365 --> 01:07:57.369
So, you come here to tell
me you fucked my husband?

01:07:59.119 --> 01:07:59.953
Why?

01:08:00.746 --> 01:08:02.248
Why would someone do that?

01:08:03.833 --> 01:08:05.501
You know how cruel that is?

01:08:06.503 --> 01:08:07.876
He's dead.

01:08:07.878 --> 01:08:10.382
If it's so cruel, why
don't you look sad about it?

01:08:11.298 --> 01:08:12.130
What do you mean?

01:08:12.132 --> 01:08:12.965
Look at your face.

01:08:12.967 --> 01:08:14.800
You look relieved, happy almost.

01:08:14.802 --> 01:08:16.218
You think I'm happy he's dead?

01:08:16.220 --> 01:08:17.178
No,

01:08:17.180 --> 01:08:18.807
I think you're
happy he fucked me.

01:08:19.515 --> 01:08:20.557
You're insane.

01:08:21.225 --> 01:08:22.268
Eyes don't lie.

01:08:25.354 --> 01:08:27.398
You're even happy
I'm here, aren't you?

01:08:28.564 --> 01:08:30.982
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

01:08:30.984 --> 01:08:31.819
Why?

01:08:32.904 --> 01:08:34.406
You know nothing about me.

01:08:35.238 --> 01:08:36.865
I know some things about you.

01:08:38.493 --> 01:08:41.371
Michael understood why you
were doing what you were doing.

01:08:43.122 --> 01:08:44.330
He wasn't even mad.

01:08:44.332 --> 01:08:47.335
He just wanted you to be happy.

01:08:48.420 --> 01:08:51.420
Bullshit. He didn't know.

01:08:51.421 --> 01:08:54.464
He told me you were the
best person he ever met,

01:08:54.466 --> 01:08:56.010
how you even love bugs.

01:09:00.430 --> 01:09:02.223
He told me how you'd wake him
up in the middle of the night

01:09:02.225 --> 01:09:04.560
to catch a spider
and put it outside.

01:09:05.729 --> 01:09:06.560
"Most girls would
squash them," he said,

01:09:06.563 --> 01:09:07.979
"but not Rachel."

01:09:08.981 --> 01:09:10.108
Did he really know?

01:09:10.734 --> 01:09:11.568
Yes.

01:09:12.694 --> 01:09:14.154
He knew he lost you
a long time ago.

01:09:15.363 --> 01:09:19.866
He just didn't know
how to let you go.

01:09:19.868 --> 01:09:20.702
And he wasn't mad?

01:09:22.162 --> 01:09:22.996
Why not?

01:09:24.203 --> 01:09:25.832
He was too busy being
mad at everything else.

01:09:27.332 --> 01:09:30.586
The thought of someone making
you happy again was nice.

01:09:36.466 --> 01:09:37.801
Did he die on purpose?

01:09:38.595 --> 01:09:40.596
- I mean, did he...
- No.

01:09:45.393 --> 01:09:46.935
Unfortunately, it was his time.

01:09:48.979 --> 01:09:51.313
But, at least he went happy.

01:09:51.314 --> 01:09:53.609
I don't remember the
last time I saw him happy.

01:10:00.199 --> 01:10:02.077
What he wanted
most for you was

01:10:03.578 --> 01:10:04.579
for you to be happy.

01:10:05.497 --> 01:10:06.331
I know he's not here,

01:10:08.041 --> 01:10:10.333
but you still are, Rachel.

01:10:10.335 --> 01:10:11.670
But, he should be, too.

01:10:14.046 --> 01:10:15.881
In a way, he kind
of is still here.

01:10:16.382 --> 01:10:19.634
How?

01:10:19.636 --> 01:10:20.887
I've seen this before.

01:10:21.220 --> 01:10:22.054
In fact, it's
happened to me once.

01:10:22.514 --> 01:10:23.347
Seen what?

01:10:23.931 --> 01:10:24.890
Have you been vomiting lately?

01:10:25.557 --> 01:10:27.058
My husband just died.

01:10:27.060 --> 01:10:28.436
And have you been feeling
ill in the mornings?

01:10:29.354 --> 01:10:30.980
My husband just died.

01:10:32.774 --> 01:10:34.147
No more smoking for you.

01:10:34.149 --> 01:10:35.150
Excuse me?

01:10:35.819 --> 01:10:38.486
You are pregnant.

01:10:38.488 --> 01:10:41.738
No, I'm hungover and
I took too many pills.

01:10:41.740 --> 01:10:43.700
No more drinking
for you, either.

01:10:43.702 --> 01:10:45.367
No, I'm not pregnant.

01:10:45.369 --> 01:10:47.452
You are, and this
stupid little letter

01:10:47.454 --> 01:10:48.579
you were planning
on leaving behind,

01:10:48.581 --> 01:10:49.539
I'm gonna take that, too.

01:10:49.541 --> 01:10:50.873
How did you know about that?

01:10:50.875 --> 01:10:53.375
It's written all
over your face,

01:10:53.377 --> 01:10:54.920
but you can't
clock out just yet.

01:10:55.838 --> 01:10:57.215
You're about to be a mommy.

01:10:58.550 --> 01:10:59.592
I can't see you.

01:11:02.511 --> 01:11:05.429
Something is wrong.

01:11:05.431 --> 01:11:06.388
The pills, I took too many.

01:11:06.390 --> 01:11:07.433
It's not the pills.

01:11:08.560 --> 01:11:11.271
That's just you
deciding to live again.

01:11:12.439 --> 01:11:14.229
Only people who are
about to die can see me.

01:11:14.231 --> 01:11:16.523
What?

01:11:16.525 --> 01:11:17.693
I'm so fucked up.

01:11:19.154 --> 01:11:20.030
It was a pleasure
working with you, Rachel.

01:11:20.529 --> 01:11:24.156
What are you?

01:11:24.158 --> 01:11:25.076
I'm a mommy, too.

01:11:33.417 --> 01:11:34.666
So, do you make good
money at this gig?

01:11:34.668 --> 01:11:35.793
I wouldn't say good money,

01:11:35.795 --> 01:11:36.962
but the hours are good.

01:11:38.172 --> 01:11:39.590
Gives me all day to
get my shit done.

01:11:41.134 --> 01:11:43.009
What kinda shit you need
gettin' done?

01:11:43.011 --> 01:11:45.344
I'm tryin' to be a singer.

01:11:45.346 --> 01:11:47.179
Oh, you don't do rap, do you?

01:11:47.181 --> 01:11:49.098
No.

01:11:49.100 --> 01:11:50.433
I mean, I wish I did,

01:11:50.435 --> 01:11:51.853
but my mouth doesn't
move that fast, so.

01:11:52.686 --> 01:11:53.813
Well, let's hear it.

01:11:54.689 --> 01:11:56.563
Blow them pipes.

01:11:56.565 --> 01:11:57.649
Maybe another time.

01:11:59.444 --> 01:12:00.278
Oh, well.

01:12:01.863 --> 01:12:02.697
Time,

01:12:04.323 --> 01:12:06.406
that's somethin' I
don't have much of.

01:12:06.408 --> 01:12:08.118
Well, then I
think you're ready.

01:12:09.871 --> 01:12:10.704
Man up.

01:12:12.082 --> 01:12:13.708
A girl needs a
father in her life,

01:12:14.917 --> 01:12:17.418
even if it's only for a
few, fleeting moments.

01:12:17.420 --> 01:12:18.585
And if she gets a
brother out of it, too,

01:12:18.587 --> 01:12:19.546
then she scored.

01:12:21.632 --> 01:12:22.466
Okay.

01:12:24.176 --> 01:12:25.094

was quite nice.

01:15:43.292 --> 01:15:44.584
So nice, in fact,

01:15:44.586 --> 01:15:47.255
that I was a little sad.

01:15:49.006 --> 01:15:51.216
How does somethin'
nice make someone sad?

01:15:56.014 --> 01:15:56.847
Banana!

01:16:00.726 --> 01:16:06.772
Banana!

01:16:06.774 --> 01:16:07.608
Banana!

01:16:11.945 --> 01:16:15.072
You haven't seen my Banana
run by here, have you?

01:16:15.074 --> 01:16:15.908
Excuse me?

01:16:16.826 --> 01:16:18.201
She's my dog.

01:16:18.203 --> 01:16:19.245
I lost my dog.

01:16:19.912 --> 01:16:20.746
There, I said it.

01:16:22.498 --> 01:16:24.541
No, but the fact that I haven't
seen her is a good thing.

01:16:25.585 --> 01:16:26.418
Trust me.

01:16:27.628 --> 01:16:28.460
You look like you
lost something, too.

01:16:28.462 --> 01:16:29.296
Are you okay?

01:16:30.715 --> 01:16:32.050
Did you lose your cat?

01:16:33.510 --> 01:16:37.135
I lost something else.

01:16:37.137 --> 01:16:38.264
Are you okay?

01:16:39.306 --> 01:16:41.518
I'll be great when
she's back in my arms.

01:16:42.851 --> 01:16:43.686
No, I mean,

01:16:44.604 --> 01:16:46.064
are you feeling okay,

01:16:47.606 --> 01:16:48.440
physically?

01:16:49.650 --> 01:16:50.484
Never better.

01:16:52.945 --> 01:16:55.573
Maybe I can help you find
what you're looking for.

01:16:57.324 --> 01:16:59.827
Maybe I just feel a
little lost right now.

01:17:01.621 --> 01:17:03.412
I know what you mean.

01:17:05.792 --> 01:17:09.087
The truth is maybe we're
all a bit lost, aren't we?

01:17:11.422 --> 01:17:13.298
It's like the boats out there,

01:17:15.135 --> 01:17:18.635
searching for the shore.

01:17:18.637 --> 01:17:19.596
What's your name?

01:17:20.265 --> 01:17:21.099
Francesca.

01:17:21.975 --> 01:17:22.809
What's yours?

01:17:23.851 --> 01:17:24.685
Emma.

01:17:26.770 --> 01:17:29.148
Well, Francesca, it was
a delight meeting you,

01:17:30.233 --> 01:17:31.735
but I should continue
my search now.

01:17:37.782 --> 01:17:41.241
I hope you find what
you're looking for.

01:17:41.243 --> 01:17:42.244
Thank you.

01:17:52.296 --> 01:17:54.173
Well, your boyfriend sounds
like a total fuck-face.

01:17:56.216 --> 01:17:57.549
Aren't you the one
who's supposed to be

01:17:57.551 --> 01:17:59.345
complaining about
life here, not me?

01:18:00.180 --> 01:18:02.263
Well, I now know why

01:18:02.265 --> 01:18:03.598
your day started off so shitty,

01:18:03.600 --> 01:18:05.393
but I still don't
know the nice part.

01:18:06.935 --> 01:18:09.353
Well, before you came in
my bar and broke everything,

01:18:09.355 --> 01:18:12.565
I was chattin'
with this old man.

01:18:12.567 --> 01:18:13.398
He had a real nasty cough.

01:18:13.400 --> 01:18:14.485
He said he was dying.

01:18:15.153 --> 01:18:16.068
That's sad, right?

01:18:16.070 --> 01:18:17.695
That's not the nice part, is it?

01:18:17.697 --> 01:18:21.493
No, he took a bus from Reno
to come visit his daughter.

01:18:22.327 --> 01:18:23.161
He's never met her before.

01:18:23.828 --> 01:18:25.870
Hmm, one of those guys.

01:18:25.872 --> 01:18:28.790
Yeah, he was in here
to muster up the balls

01:18:28.792 --> 01:18:30.210
to actually go through with it.

01:18:31.920 --> 01:18:33.922
He said that he'd
taken the trip,

01:18:35.006 --> 01:18:35.921
like a half a dozen times,

01:18:35.923 --> 01:18:38.217
but never actually did it.

01:18:39.344 --> 01:18:41.096
It's kinda sad, but nice, right?

01:18:42.012 --> 01:18:42.846
Stories from the bar,

01:18:43.681 --> 01:18:44.682
they get deep.

01:18:45.641 --> 01:18:46.975
Occupational hazard.

01:18:48.520 --> 01:18:49.602
I'm either an ass to grab
or a shoulder to cry on.

01:18:49.604 --> 01:18:51.021
Well, do I get to choose?

01:18:52.106 --> 01:18:54.234
No, but
seriously, that's nice,

01:18:55.734 --> 01:18:57.569
and it won't be sad if he
actually goes through with it.

01:18:58.070 --> 01:18:58.904
So, all is well.

01:19:00.073 --> 01:19:02.200
Yeah, but I feel
a little guilty.

01:19:02.783 --> 01:19:03.616
Why?

01:19:03.618 --> 01:19:04.452
I lied to him.

01:19:05.869 --> 01:19:07.452
I lied to a sick, dying old man.

01:19:07.454 --> 01:19:10.873
Well, a lot of people
lie. It's normal.

01:19:10.875 --> 01:19:12.502
Yeah, but I lied to
make him feel worse.

01:19:13.336 --> 01:19:14.253
Do you think that's cruel?

01:19:15.087 --> 01:19:17.256
It depends. What was the lie?

01:19:18.466 --> 01:19:20.008
I told him my dad
was my everything.

01:19:20.010 --> 01:19:20.844
Is he not?

01:19:21.469 --> 01:19:22.302
I never met my dad,

01:19:23.762 --> 01:19:26.723
but I don't want that
old guy feeling like

01:19:26.725 --> 01:19:28.643
what he did was
normal, you know?

01:19:29.853 --> 01:19:32.480
I wanted him to feel
guilty, horrible even,

01:19:33.731 --> 01:19:34.733
so he'd go through
with it this time.

01:19:35.899 --> 01:19:36.900
Sounds like a
good lie in my book.

01:19:40.822 --> 01:19:43.613
What about you, Johnny?

01:19:43.615 --> 01:19:45.116
Got any sob stories to spill?

01:19:45.118 --> 01:19:45.952
Me?

01:19:47.494 --> 01:19:49.956
I'm like a brick wall when
it comes to mushy stuff.

01:19:51.498 --> 01:19:54.085
Well, sooner or later, every
wall crumbles like cookies.

01:19:55.252 --> 01:19:59.004
Crumbles like
cookies, huh?

01:19:59.006 --> 01:20:03.009
Is there a smoking
patio or something,

01:20:03.011 --> 01:20:04.968
where I can?

01:20:04.970 --> 01:20:05.888
Holy
shit, look at you.

01:20:07.431 --> 01:20:08.388
You have some
deep-rooted issues.

01:20:08.390 --> 01:20:10.641
What are you talkin' about?

01:20:10.643 --> 01:20:12.727
For a sliver of vulnerability,

01:20:12.729 --> 01:20:14.481
you make a mad
dash for the exit.

01:20:15.148 --> 01:20:17.397
You can come with me.

01:20:17.399 --> 01:20:18.482
I don't smoke.

01:20:18.484 --> 01:20:20.152
Then, keep me company.

01:20:21.154 --> 01:20:23.031
I'm manning the fort.

01:20:26.909 --> 01:20:28.284
Actually, hold on.

01:20:28.286 --> 01:20:29.537
Can I take my 15?

01:20:30.829 --> 01:20:31.661
What?

01:20:31.663 --> 01:20:34.624
I don't care.

01:20:34.626 --> 01:20:35.752
All right, let's go.

01:20:37.796 --> 01:20:38.630
Oh, come on.

01:20:39.922 --> 01:20:41.505
What was up with that girl
that was like, screaming?

01:20:41.507 --> 01:20:43.342
Hey, guys, we got $86.

01:20:44.511 --> 01:20:45.970
Thanks, see you guys tomorrow.

01:20:46.887 --> 01:20:48.345
Good job today.

01:20:48.347 --> 01:20:49.930
Hey, I think we convinced
at least two people today.

01:20:49.932 --> 01:20:54.643
Yes!

01:21:35.185 --> 01:21:36.268
Answer your fucking phone.

01:21:36.270 --> 01:21:37.646
Answer your fucking phone.

01:21:57.876 --> 01:21:59.166
So, it's that kinda
smoke break, is it?

01:21:59.168 --> 01:22:00.543
Bartender requirement,

01:22:00.545 --> 01:22:02.172
gotta bring light
to the darkness.

01:22:03.506 --> 01:22:04.423
Where's your cigarette?

01:22:08.136 --> 01:22:10.135
That's cute.

01:22:10.137 --> 01:22:11.847
My gateway drug to the patch.

01:22:13.057 --> 01:22:14.932
No, it's good.

01:22:14.934 --> 01:22:16.183
I can't smoke a real one.

01:22:16.185 --> 01:22:17.519
It's bad for my vocal chords.

01:22:18.688 --> 01:22:19.939
I could tell
you were a singer.

01:22:22.149 --> 01:22:22.983
Really?

01:22:23.275 --> 01:22:25.317
How so?

01:22:25.319 --> 01:22:26.820
I heard singin' to
yourself earlier at the bar.

01:22:27.738 --> 01:22:28.947
- You were watching me?
- I was.

01:22:32.159 --> 01:22:32.993
Well, Johnny,

01:22:34.537 --> 01:22:36.581
let's build a window into that
impenetrable wall of yours.

01:22:38.041 --> 01:22:39.000
This is where my cookie
crumbles, all right.

01:22:40.167 --> 01:22:41.210
What do you wanna know?

01:22:43.253 --> 01:22:44.088
Anything.

01:22:45.256 --> 01:22:46.589
You got like 14
minutes to wow me.

01:22:46.591 --> 01:22:50.300
Oh, well, I live in New York.

01:22:50.302 --> 01:22:51.843
Wow.

01:22:51.845 --> 01:22:52.762
I already wowed you.

01:22:52.764 --> 01:22:54.013
You were easy.

01:22:54.015 --> 01:22:56.101
No, I
just love New York.

01:22:57.268 --> 01:22:58.226
I've always wanted
to live there.

01:22:58.228 --> 01:22:59.268
- You should.
- Oh, should I?

01:22:59.270 --> 01:23:00.227
Why not?

01:23:00.229 --> 01:23:01.478
L.A.'s fucking nuts,

01:23:01.480 --> 01:23:03.856
plus we have these
things called seasons.

01:23:03.858 --> 01:23:05.777
I think you might like 'em.

01:23:06.653 --> 01:23:07.485
What do you do in New York?

01:23:07.487 --> 01:23:08.318
I program apps.

01:23:08.320 --> 01:23:09.488
What kind of apps?

01:23:10.073 --> 01:23:12.240
All kinds.

01:23:12.242 --> 01:23:13.493
Right now, I'm workin'
on an app that,

01:23:14.703 --> 01:23:15.992
well, let's say you
lose your dog or cat,

01:23:15.994 --> 01:23:17.411
you can turn on the app,
and it will locate it.

01:23:17.413 --> 01:23:18.995
Well, they have to
buy a microchip,

01:23:18.997 --> 01:23:20.580
but I think it will be pretty
big once people catch on.

01:23:20.582 --> 01:23:23.835
So, it's like a
GPS for your pet?

01:23:23.837 --> 01:23:24.671
Exactly like that.

01:23:25.421 --> 01:23:26.713
Look at you,

01:23:26.715 --> 01:23:28.339
saving the world
one pet at a time.

01:23:28.341 --> 01:23:31.049
I just lost a few
pets growin' up,

01:23:31.051 --> 01:23:34.012
and I haven't quite
gotten over it yet.

01:23:34.014 --> 01:23:34.847
Me, too.

01:23:36.015 --> 01:23:37.514
My first broken
heart was Wolfie.

01:23:37.516 --> 01:23:39.892
I swore I'd never love again.

01:23:39.894 --> 01:23:42.564
Did you ever love again?

01:23:43.230 --> 01:23:44.148
Not like my first.

01:23:47.359 --> 01:23:49.652
So, how long are
you in town for?

01:23:49.654 --> 01:23:50.488
I don't know.

01:23:52.239 --> 01:23:53.657
I might be leaving really soon.

01:23:55.993 --> 01:23:57.660
I think I broke
your cigarette thingy.

01:24:02.292 --> 01:24:03.126
What?

01:24:05.377 --> 01:24:07.253
Why are you
really here, Johnny?

01:24:07.255 --> 01:24:08.256
Just visiting.

01:24:09.381 --> 01:24:11.467
A friend, a
girlfriend, boyfriend?

01:24:12.469 --> 01:24:14.552
- I'm sensing a bit of...
- Hostility?

01:24:14.554 --> 01:24:15.762
Yeah, kinda.

01:24:15.764 --> 01:24:16.928
What's with the
sudden interrogation?

01:24:16.930 --> 01:24:18.263
You tell me.

01:24:18.265 --> 01:24:20.309
Why would I be acting a little
bit suspicious right now?

01:24:22.228 --> 01:24:23.186
Let's start over.

01:24:23.188 --> 01:24:25.187
Can we do that?

01:24:25.189 --> 01:24:26.982
You knew I was
getting married.

01:24:28.068 --> 01:24:29.025
Oh, to fuck-face.

01:24:29.027 --> 01:24:30.317
I didn't know that.

01:24:30.319 --> 01:24:32.572
Congratulations
to that, I think.

01:24:34.114 --> 01:24:36.616
I'm gonna give you one last
chance to be honest with me.

01:24:36.618 --> 01:24:38.034
Another lie, I walk.

01:24:38.036 --> 01:24:38.867
Please, don't walk.

01:24:38.869 --> 01:24:40.370
Then, don't lie to me.

01:24:40.372 --> 01:24:42.120
I have to lie.

01:24:42.122 --> 01:24:43.873
You lied to that old
man because you had to.

01:24:43.875 --> 01:24:46.670
I didn't have to. I
chose to, so choose.

01:24:47.337 --> 01:24:49.839
Okay.

01:24:50.798 --> 01:24:51.841
My name's not Johnny.

01:24:52.676 --> 01:24:53.510
How did you know?

01:24:54.301 --> 01:24:55.302
I can connect the dots,

01:24:56.387 --> 01:24:58.222
and when you said you made apps,

01:24:58.972 --> 01:24:59.888
I knew for sure.

01:24:59.890 --> 01:25:01.264
I was against this, I swear.

01:25:01.266 --> 01:25:02.933
He dumped this shit on me the
second I got to your place.

01:25:02.935 --> 01:25:04.518
Are you really playing
the victim right now?

01:25:04.520 --> 01:25:07.854
I'm just sayin' this
all his plan, not mine.

01:25:07.856 --> 01:25:09.567
You know what, Johnny?

01:25:10.819 --> 01:25:13.820
Whoever you are, it was
almost nice to meet you.

01:25:13.822 --> 01:25:15.237
Wait, please,

01:25:15.239 --> 01:25:17.951
just don't walk away.

01:25:20.578 --> 01:25:21.579
What was the plan?

01:25:22.162 --> 01:25:22.996
Tell me.

01:25:25.291 --> 01:25:27.127
Come here, talk to you,

01:25:28.086 --> 01:25:28.918
hit on you,

01:25:28.920 --> 01:25:30.046
see how you'd react.

01:25:31.046 --> 01:25:32.129
I wasn't even gonna talk
to you when I got here.

01:25:32.131 --> 01:25:34.173
I was just gonna leave,

01:25:34.175 --> 01:25:35.635
but then I spilled that drink.

01:25:36.927 --> 01:25:38.218
I don't know.

01:25:38.220 --> 01:25:39.137
Why didn't you
just keep walking?

01:25:39.139 --> 01:25:39.972
I don't know.

01:25:40.681 --> 01:25:41.515
I saw you,

01:25:43.726 --> 01:25:44.767
and I made a mistake.

01:25:44.769 --> 01:25:45.811
I talked.

01:25:47.396 --> 01:25:48.230
You talked.

01:25:49.274 --> 01:25:50.606
Let me get this straight.

01:25:50.608 --> 01:25:54.404
You came here to charm
me into bed, so what,

01:25:55.238 --> 01:25:56.403
you could tell him I cheated,

01:25:56.405 --> 01:25:57.990
so he doesn't have to marry me?

01:25:58.658 --> 01:25:59.490
I have no idea,

01:25:59.492 --> 01:26:00.324
but I know you deserve better.

01:26:00.326 --> 01:26:01.161
Do I?

01:26:01.828 --> 01:26:04.077
Do I deserve someone like you?

01:26:04.079 --> 01:26:05.039
No, better than me, too.

01:26:06.875 --> 01:26:10.500
I'm sorry.

01:26:10.502 --> 01:26:13.420
When you said that you
knew that I was a singer,

01:26:13.422 --> 01:26:14.715
was that the truth,

01:26:15.382 --> 01:26:17.633
or was that a lie, too?

01:26:17.635 --> 01:26:19.012
I swear, I don't remember
Luke ever telling me you sang.

01:26:22.097 --> 01:26:23.305
Were you really gonna do it?

01:26:23.307 --> 01:26:24.264
Go home with you? Fuck, no.

01:26:24.266 --> 01:26:26.976
No, marry Luke.

01:26:26.978 --> 01:26:27.811
I don't know,

01:26:28.896 --> 01:26:29.730
probably.

01:26:30.648 --> 01:26:31.481
Don't.

01:26:31.483 --> 01:26:32.773
That's not your call.

01:26:32.775 --> 01:26:33.775
So?

01:26:33.777 --> 01:26:34.860
So, what?

01:26:35.694 --> 01:26:36.528
So, do what you came to do.

01:26:37.447 --> 01:26:39.030
I don't even know
what that means.

01:26:39.032 --> 01:26:40.658
You came here to see if I'd
go through with it, right?

01:26:41.743 --> 01:26:44.451
Now's your chance to find out.

01:26:44.453 --> 01:26:45.496
I don't wanna find out.

01:26:46.331 --> 01:26:48.164
So, it was all bullshit.

01:26:48.166 --> 01:26:49.956
No, I don't wanna find out,

01:26:49.958 --> 01:26:50.793
because I like you.

01:26:51.461 --> 01:26:52.295
No, you don't.

01:26:53.128 --> 01:26:53.960
I think I do,

01:26:53.962 --> 01:26:54.797
and if I'm right,

01:26:55.215 --> 01:26:56.046
I don't want this
to be how we met.

01:26:56.048 --> 01:26:56.880
This is how we met.

01:26:56.882 --> 01:26:57.714
We can't change that.

01:26:57.716 --> 01:26:58.550
I know.

01:27:00.386 --> 01:27:01.510
So, what do we do now?

01:27:05.015 --> 01:27:05.849
We either step forward,

01:27:09.813 --> 01:27:10.980
or we step back.

01:27:12.106 --> 01:27:12.938
I want to,

01:27:12.940 --> 01:27:13.899
but I can't.

01:27:15.359 --> 01:27:17.653
Why, because you think
these feelings might be real?

01:27:18.320 --> 01:27:19.279
Real feeling are bad?

01:27:20.407 --> 01:27:21.446
What, fake feelings
get the girl?

01:27:21.448 --> 01:27:22.781
How fucked up is that?

01:27:22.783 --> 01:27:23.866
It felt real the
moment I saw you.

01:27:23.868 --> 01:27:24.994
Then, do it.

01:27:26.704 --> 01:27:28.832
Take a step forward
if you really want to,

01:27:29.332 --> 01:27:37.421
no more lies.

01:27:37.423 --> 01:27:39.089
What are we doing?

01:27:39.091 --> 01:27:41.009
We're getting closer.

01:27:41.011 --> 01:27:42.303
That's what people do.

01:27:43.470 --> 01:27:44.803
This is to get back
at Luke, isn't it?

01:27:44.805 --> 01:27:45.889
Maybe,

01:27:46.765 --> 01:27:48.809
or maybe this has
nothing to do with him.

01:27:50.145 --> 01:27:53.896
I think my 15 minutes...

01:28:34.898 --> 01:28:36.356
Freddie, what the...

01:28:36.358 --> 01:28:37.357
Can I help you?

01:28:37.359 --> 01:28:38.982
Does Ryan live here?

01:28:38.984 --> 01:28:39.818
Who are you?

01:28:40.528 --> 01:28:42.445
I'm...

01:28:42.447 --> 01:28:43.948
Who are you, old man? Come on.

01:28:46.117 --> 01:28:47.032
God damn it.

01:28:47.034 --> 01:28:48.702
You wreak of liquor, man.

01:28:51.206 --> 01:28:52.037
How do you know Ryan?

01:28:52.039 --> 01:28:53.414
Does she live here?

01:28:53.416 --> 01:28:55.543
You follow her
home, you pervert?

01:28:56.627 --> 01:28:57.835
No, I...

01:28:57.837 --> 01:28:59.754
Are you stalking my fiance?

01:28:59.756 --> 01:29:02.589
I just wanna meet her.

01:29:02.591 --> 01:29:03.425
Is she here?

01:29:04.301 --> 01:29:05.135
What the fuck is this?

01:29:06.011 --> 01:29:07.469
A present, you
bring her a present?

01:29:07.471 --> 01:29:09.388
You tryin' to be her sugar
daddy, is that what you're doin'?

01:29:10.475 --> 01:29:11.473
Get the fuck off my
property, before I...

01:29:15.563 --> 01:29:16.396
What the fuck?

01:29:18.483 --> 01:29:19.317
Oh, shit.

01:29:26.990 --> 01:29:28.241
Hey, there sugar love.

01:29:28.243 --> 01:29:29.411
I know you're still workin',

01:29:30.578 --> 01:29:31.869
but don't stop and
eat on your way home,

01:29:31.871 --> 01:29:33.373
'cause I'm cookin'
dinner tonight.

01:29:34.582 --> 01:29:35.831
All right, that's it.

01:29:35.833 --> 01:29:37.416
I love ya. I'll see you soon.

01:29:37.418 --> 01:29:38.252

01:30:13.537 --> 01:30:14.911
I'm sorry.

01:30:14.913 --> 01:30:15.914
What happened?

01:30:16.666 --> 01:30:17.500
How'd it go?

01:30:22.338 --> 01:30:24.964
Like I said, man,

01:30:24.966 --> 01:30:25.800
I'm sorry.

01:30:29.511 --> 01:30:32.806
What the
fuck is this, huh?

01:30:33.640 --> 01:30:35.308
What's happening right now?

01:30:35.310 --> 01:30:40.646
I said that if you made
me do this, you'd hate me.

01:30:40.648 --> 01:30:43.775
Okay, okay.

01:30:43.777 --> 01:30:44.608
Okay, very funny.

01:30:44.610 --> 01:30:45.735
Game over, okay?

01:30:45.737 --> 01:30:46.570
Fuck you.

01:30:47.447 --> 01:30:48.280
Your plan worked.

01:30:48.907 --> 01:30:50.197
Why are you holding his hand?

01:30:50.199 --> 01:30:51.949
This is what
you wanted, right?

01:30:51.951 --> 01:30:54.242
Freddie, why the fuck
are you holding her hand?

01:30:54.244 --> 01:30:55.620
Man, I know how
this looks and sounds,

01:30:55.622 --> 01:30:58.414
but shit, man, I never
felt like this before.

01:30:58.416 --> 01:30:59.665
I'm just as confused as you are.

01:30:59.667 --> 01:31:00.751
What are you doin', huh?

01:31:01.711 --> 01:31:02.835
Stop holding his hand.

01:31:02.837 --> 01:31:04.381
I don't even know what
to say to you right now.

01:31:05.631 --> 01:31:06.630
Honestly, this is
the weirdest thing

01:31:06.632 --> 01:31:07.548
that's ever happened to me.

01:31:07.550 --> 01:31:08.717
Yeah, no fuckin' shit.

01:31:10.261 --> 01:31:12.430
God, you guys are fuckin'
with me, all right?

01:31:14.474 --> 01:31:17.683
I'm about to lose my
shit, I swear to God.

01:31:17.685 --> 01:31:18.518
I'm sorry.

01:31:18.520 --> 01:31:19.354
You're sorry?

01:31:20.063 --> 01:31:21.189
Now, you know for sure.

01:31:22.690 --> 01:31:26.193
No.

01:31:26.653 --> 01:31:27.818
No, no.

01:31:27.820 --> 01:31:29.403
Come here, we're
gettin' married, okay?

01:31:29.405 --> 01:31:30.948
No, we're not.

01:31:31.573 --> 01:31:32.615
No.

01:31:32.617 --> 01:31:33.449
We're getting
married. Come here.

01:31:33.451 --> 01:31:34.284
We're not.

01:31:35.578 --> 01:31:36.619
This isn't happening.

01:31:36.621 --> 01:31:37.829
This isn't happening.

01:31:37.831 --> 01:31:39.539
This is just a "Ha ha,

01:31:39.541 --> 01:31:41.456
"let's teach the asshole
a lesson," right?

01:31:41.458 --> 01:31:42.292
It might be.

01:31:44.003 --> 01:31:46.420
It might not be. I don't know.

01:31:46.422 --> 01:31:47.715
Oh. Oh, it might not be.

01:31:48.800 --> 01:31:50.135
Stop fucking touching her, okay?

01:31:51.802 --> 01:31:52.634
No, how could you do this?

01:31:52.636 --> 01:31:53.468
How could you do this?

01:31:53.470 --> 01:31:55.139
You did this to us.

01:31:56.432 --> 01:31:59.349
How
could you do this, huh?

01:31:59.351 --> 01:32:00.183
How the fuck could you do this?

01:32:00.185 --> 01:32:01.018
Dude, you asked me to.

01:32:01.020 --> 01:32:02.269
I asked you? Fuck you.

01:32:05.817 --> 01:32:06.775
I'm getting my things.

01:32:07.777 --> 01:32:08.610
Fuck you.

01:32:09.404 --> 01:32:11.111
Fuck you, man.

01:32:11.113 --> 01:32:13.781
Where did you get that?

01:32:13.783 --> 01:32:16.327
Luke, where did you get that?

01:32:16.994 --> 01:32:17.910
Fuck you! God.

01:32:17.912 --> 01:32:19.077
Luke, where did you get that?!

01:32:19.079 --> 01:32:19.913
Okay, stop.

01:32:21.498 --> 01:32:22.375
You're a fucker.

01:32:23.752 --> 01:32:24.666
Fuck.

01:32:24.668 --> 01:32:25.500
Where did you get this?

01:32:25.502 --> 01:32:26.337
I'm sorry.

01:32:27.212 --> 01:32:28.340
I was scared.

01:32:28.840 --> 01:32:29.755
I don't care.

01:32:29.757 --> 01:32:30.673
I don't care about that, Luke,

01:32:30.675 --> 01:32:31.632
just tell me where you got this.

01:32:31.634 --> 01:32:32.801
Just tell her.

01:32:33.720 --> 01:32:35.053
I don't know, fuck.

01:32:35.055 --> 01:32:36.890
An old guy had a heart
attack at the front door.

01:32:38.182 --> 01:32:39.014
I called 911,

01:32:39.016 --> 01:32:41.017
and they took him away.

01:32:41.019 --> 01:32:43.396
I forgot to give
them the fucking box.

01:32:43.938 --> 01:32:46.731
Oh, my God.

01:32:46.733 --> 01:32:47.773
Oh, my God.

01:32:47.775 --> 01:32:48.857
I can't breathe.

01:32:48.859 --> 01:32:50.319
Whoa, whoa, calm
down. What is it?

01:32:50.987 --> 01:32:52.529
What did he say?

01:32:53.198 --> 01:32:54.155
I don't know.

01:32:54.157 --> 01:32:55.492
What did he say?

01:32:55.992 --> 01:32:56.866
I don't know,

01:32:56.868 --> 01:32:57.744
he fuckin',

01:32:59.537 --> 01:33:00.997
he asked about you, that's all.

01:33:02.164 --> 01:33:03.416
Oh, my God.

01:33:04.751 --> 01:33:06.628
- What's happening right now?
- I don't know.

01:33:15.220 --> 01:33:17.553
He was my dad.

01:33:17.555 --> 01:33:18.390
What?

01:33:19.181 --> 01:33:22.559
Oh, my God.

01:33:38.784 --> 01:33:40.660
I can't.

01:33:40.662 --> 01:33:43.579
Step forward or step back.

01:33:43.581 --> 01:33:44.916
What the fuck does that mean?

01:34:03.851 --> 01:34:07.061
Who is it?

01:34:07.063 --> 01:34:11.273
My brother.

01:34:11.275 --> 01:34:15.068
I have a brother.

01:34:15.070 --> 01:34:15.904
I'm home.

01:34:17.614 --> 01:34:18.449
Hey.

01:34:18.783 --> 01:34:20.074
Hey.

01:34:20.076 --> 01:34:21.366
Clothes your eyes and
take your shirt off.

01:34:21.368 --> 01:34:22.660
I got a present
for you.

01:34:22.662 --> 01:34:24.579
Wait, I have to
tell you somethin'.

01:34:24.581 --> 01:34:25.957
Just do it, hurry up.

01:34:27.458 --> 01:34:28.750
Just close your eyes.

01:34:28.752 --> 01:34:30.293
Come on.

01:34:33.756 --> 01:34:35.882
- Are your eyes closed?
- They're closed.

01:34:35.884 --> 01:34:37.215
Okay, good, good.

01:34:37.217 --> 01:34:38.135
Keep 'em closed, keep 'em
closed, keep 'em closed.

01:34:39.804 --> 01:34:41.096
All right, arms.

01:34:44.809 --> 01:34:45.685
Open 'em.

01:34:48.938 --> 01:34:49.937
You hate it,

01:34:49.939 --> 01:34:51.981
but you love ducks.
You love ducks.

01:34:51.983 --> 01:34:54.903
I love it. It's
awesome. Thank you.

01:34:56.779 --> 01:34:58.155
I've gotta tell you somethin'.

01:34:59.407 --> 01:35:01.409
Okay, okay, but hurry,
all right? I'm starving.

01:35:02.243 --> 01:35:03.119
What'd you make for dinner?

01:35:04.328 --> 01:35:05.620
Wait, why don't
I smell anything?

01:35:05.622 --> 01:35:08.750
Just sit down for me, please.

01:35:10.001 --> 01:35:10.835
Come here.

01:35:11.502 --> 01:35:12.420
Okay, I will.

01:35:13.962 --> 01:35:17.924
You're startin' to
freak me out, Damon.

01:35:17.926 --> 01:35:19.342
So, your mom called me.

01:35:19.344 --> 01:35:21.011
She was tryin' to
get ahold of you.

01:35:22.930 --> 01:35:23.929
Is everything okay?
Is she all right?

01:35:23.931 --> 01:35:24.805
Yeah, she's fine.

01:35:24.807 --> 01:35:25.684
She's fine.

01:35:26.350 --> 01:35:27.393
It's your father.

01:35:28.811 --> 01:35:30.229
I guess he came here.

01:35:30.814 --> 01:35:31.648
What?

01:35:32.899 --> 01:35:34.818
My dad came here?

01:35:35.568 --> 01:35:36.483
Like, he's here?

01:35:36.485 --> 01:35:37.319
Can I just finish, please?

01:35:37.987 --> 01:35:38.820
This isn't easy, okay?

01:35:38.822 --> 01:35:39.861
Yeah, well, okay,

01:35:39.863 --> 01:35:40.698
well, please say it.

01:35:41.908 --> 01:35:45.120
Your mom got a call
from the hospital, Taylor.

01:35:47.706 --> 01:35:50.915
I guess she said
they told her that,

01:35:50.917 --> 01:35:52.043
I guess your father,

01:35:52.961 --> 01:35:54.003
he died. He just died.

01:35:56.881 --> 01:36:02.259
What?

01:36:02.261 --> 01:36:03.885
God, no, look, no.

01:36:03.887 --> 01:36:07.305
This is gotta just be some
massive mix-up or something.

01:36:07.307 --> 01:36:09.060
My dad would never
come here, right?

01:36:10.936 --> 01:36:12.019
He hates me.

01:36:12.021 --> 01:36:12.894
But he came here,

01:36:12.896 --> 01:36:14.231
that's the point.

01:36:14.899 --> 01:36:17.357
He came all this way.

01:36:17.359 --> 01:36:18.860
He came all this fuckin' way,

01:36:18.862 --> 01:36:22.487
now let's let him do
what he came here to do,

01:36:22.489 --> 01:36:25.700
and go see him.

01:36:25.702 --> 01:36:29.870
It's important.

01:36:29.872 --> 01:36:30.706
No.

01:36:31.166 --> 01:36:32.080
I can't go.

01:36:32.082 --> 01:36:34.043
I'm not gonna go.

01:36:36.880 --> 01:36:37.713
Okay.

01:36:38.297 --> 01:36:39.131
But if I cared,

01:36:42.510 --> 01:36:43.845
you'd be right there with me?

01:36:45.346 --> 01:36:46.347
Of course.

01:36:47.724 --> 01:36:48.557
Come here.

01:36:49.391 --> 01:36:54.396
Come here.

01:36:55.273 --> 01:36:56.106
I'm sorry.

01:37:12.748 --> 01:37:15.001
Off you go.

01:37:16.252 --> 01:37:17.796
Where exactly are we going?

01:37:19.296 --> 01:37:22.591
Well, looks like there's
only one place left to go.

01:37:38.024 --> 01:37:40.318
I just have one question.

01:37:41.110 --> 01:37:41.944
She's yours.

01:37:43.822 --> 01:37:46.615
She?

01:37:55.708 --> 01:37:58.711
Congratulations, papa.

01:38:05.885 --> 01:38:07.012
I knew I'd see you real soon.

01:38:08.762 --> 01:38:09.639
Are you ready?

01:38:11.099 --> 01:38:13.307
I didn't come this far
only to come this far.

01:38:13.309 --> 01:38:15.729
It's just a few more
steps, and you're there.

01:38:17.479 --> 01:38:18.522
I'm going,

01:38:19.481 --> 01:38:21.150
but you can bet your
ass I'll be back.

01:38:23.153 --> 01:38:26.361
The world hasn't seen
the last of me.

01:38:26.363 --> 01:38:28.656
I don't think it has.

01:38:28.658 --> 01:38:30.326
Maybe as a bird,

01:38:31.703 --> 01:38:32.829
or a horse.

01:38:33.496 --> 01:38:34.581
I like them, too.

01:38:35.497 --> 01:38:38.500
I just can't draw them
for shit.

01:38:39.168 --> 01:38:40.500
Aren't you coming with?

01:38:40.502 --> 01:38:42.128
I have someone I
have to see first.

01:38:42.130 --> 01:38:44.757
Oh, yeah, I know that look.

01:38:45.591 --> 01:38:47.176
I'll see you around, then.

01:39:20.167 --> 01:39:22.670
I can't believe I met my dad.

01:39:23.505 --> 01:39:24.631
I think I met him, too.

01:39:26.048 --> 01:39:28.215
What, how?

01:39:28.217 --> 01:39:29.927
When he left the
bar, I bumped into him.

01:39:31.136 --> 01:39:32.012
I actually
called him chief.

01:39:33.139 --> 01:39:34.306
I guess I am pretty clumsy.

01:39:36.975 --> 01:39:39.436
I don't know how
to feel right now.

01:39:40.270 --> 01:39:42.690
You know, happy that I met him,

01:39:44.192 --> 01:39:46.401
or sad that I lost him again,

01:39:46.403 --> 01:39:47.237
mad at Luke?

01:39:48.404 --> 01:39:49.447
Be all three.

01:39:51.990 --> 01:39:55.161
Thanks for playin'
along back there,

01:39:56.537 --> 01:40:00.498
but you don't have
to wait with me.

01:40:00.500 --> 01:40:01.333
I'll be fine.

01:40:02.002 --> 01:40:02.919
Hey, I met your dad,

01:40:03.670 --> 01:40:04.671
ruined your wedding,

01:40:05.546 --> 01:40:08.423
kissed my friend's girl today.

01:40:08.425 --> 01:40:10.383
I might as well stay and
meet your long-lost brother.

01:40:10.385 --> 01:40:11.845
I sound so dysfunctional.

01:40:13.054 --> 01:40:14.512
Plus, I realized

01:40:14.514 --> 01:40:17.639
I need a place to stay tonight.

01:40:17.641 --> 01:40:18.934
I think I do, too.

01:40:24.690 --> 01:40:25.524
4B.

01:40:26.734 --> 01:40:27.943
I think it's this way.

01:40:30.113 --> 01:40:30.947
Taylor?

01:40:33.323 --> 01:40:34.158
Yeah.

01:40:41.916 --> 01:40:42.917
Who are you?

01:40:47.963 --> 01:40:48.797
Hi.

01:40:49.506 --> 01:40:50.341
Hey.

01:41:02.145 --> 01:41:04.519
What are you doing, Francesca?

01:41:04.521 --> 01:41:06.522
I've done my job.

01:41:06.524 --> 01:41:07.357
Michael and Cliff,

01:41:07.359 --> 01:41:08.232
two departures,

01:41:08.234 --> 01:41:09.692
Rachel and her baby,

01:41:09.694 --> 01:41:10.567
two saves,

01:41:10.569 --> 01:41:11.443
I'm done.

01:41:11.445 --> 01:41:12.986
She won't be able to see you.

01:41:12.988 --> 01:41:14.490
I want to see her.

01:41:16.618 --> 01:41:17.909
The longer you stay here,

01:41:17.911 --> 01:41:20.952
the longer it is for
you to take another job.

01:41:20.954 --> 01:41:22.871
There are people that need you.

01:41:22.873 --> 01:41:25.126
She needs me.

01:41:26.211 --> 01:41:29.379
My daughter needs me.

01:41:29.381 --> 01:41:32.255
I don't know if you
were ever a mother,

01:41:32.257 --> 01:41:34.133
but I would give up
saving a million lives

01:41:34.135 --> 01:41:35.259
if I could see her.

01:41:35.261 --> 01:41:37.303
You cannot break
the rules, Francesca.

01:41:37.305 --> 01:41:38.390
Fuck the rules.

01:41:42.685 --> 01:41:44.561
You can have tonight.

01:41:45.396 --> 01:41:47.314
Meet me at the shore at sunrise.

01:41:54.530 --> 01:41:55.532
Thank you.

01:42:04.416 --> 01:42:08.128
It's time for bed,
little rascal.

01:42:10.421 --> 01:42:11.463
Did you brush your teeth?

01:42:12.465 --> 01:42:16.384
Yes.

01:42:16.386 --> 01:42:17.220
You want this up?

01:42:18.345 --> 01:42:19.179
Sure.

01:42:21.474 --> 01:42:22.976
Sweet dreams, honey bunny.

01:42:23.768 --> 01:42:24.769
Goodnight, Miss P.

01:42:25.270 --> 01:42:42.785
Goodnight.

01:42:42.787 --> 01:42:44.372
I love you, Mommy.

01:43:02.056 --> 01:43:56.401
I love you, honey bunny.

01:43:56.403 --> 01:43:57.567
Not yet.

01:43:57.569 --> 01:43:58.654
No matter who you are,

01:43:59.322 --> 01:44:00.364
what tongue you speak,

01:44:01.282 --> 01:44:02.117
or where you're from,

01:44:03.076 --> 01:44:04.116
there are always
the same two words

01:44:04.118 --> 01:44:05.619
that are uttered before death.

01:44:06.537 --> 01:44:07.413
Sometimes shouted,

01:44:08.331 --> 01:44:09.830
sometimes whispered,

01:44:09.832 --> 01:44:11.125
but always,

01:44:11.626 --> 01:44:13.336
"Not yet."

01:44:16.922 --> 01:44:19.050
If you're here
to take me back...

01:44:20.260 --> 01:44:21.094
I didn't come
to take you back.

01:44:21.552 --> 01:44:23.385
Then, why are you here?

01:44:23.387 --> 01:44:26.680
Free will didn't die
just because you did.

01:44:26.682 --> 01:44:28.935
The choice is yours.

01:44:30.020 --> 01:44:31.146
I can stay?

01:44:32.271 --> 01:44:35.774
What they don't
understand is sometimes,

01:44:37.318 --> 01:44:41.614
even though the ones we love
can't always hear and see us,

01:44:43.574 --> 01:44:46.368
it's worth it just
to hear and see them.

01:44:47.787 --> 01:44:50.412
What do you choose, Francesca?

01:44:50.414 --> 01:44:52.125
I can't leave her again.

01:44:53.960 --> 01:44:54.877
Then, don't.

01:44:57.255 --> 01:45:13.393
But first, we must go
before they come for you.

01:45:13.395 --> 01:45:16.023
I'll see you soon, my love.

01:45:35.959 --> 01:45:40.959
