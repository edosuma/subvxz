[thunder booming]

00:45.340 --> 00:47.205
SHAWN.

00:47.240 --> 00:49.174
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

00:49.210 --> 00:51.098
YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO BE ASLEEP
TWO HOURS AGO.

00:51.150 --> 00:52.469
I WAS WATCHING.

00:52.520 --> 00:54.818
AND THEN I KNOW I SHOULDN'T,
BUT THEN...

00:54.850 --> 00:56.340
I DIDN'T WANT
TO GO BACK UPSTAIRS.

00:56.390 --> 00:59.848
I WAS SCARED.

00:59.890 --> 01:02.825
ALL RIGHT.

01:02.860 --> 01:04.384
NOW LISTEN,

01:04.430 --> 01:06.250
NOW YOU KNOW THAT NONE OF THIS
IS REAL, RIGHT?

01:06.300 --> 01:07.824
IT'S ALL MAKE-BELIEVE.

01:07.860 --> 01:09.862
PEOPLE DO NOT BECOME
BLOODTHIRSTY MONSTERS

01:09.900 --> 01:12.266
AFTER THEY GET SHOT.

01:12.300 --> 01:14.188
IN FACT, I'VE HAD A LOT
OF EXPERIENCE IN THE FIELD

01:14.240 --> 01:15.138
WITH PUNCTURE WOUNDS,

01:15.170 --> 01:17.138
AND THERE'S NO WAY
A GIANT DART TO THE LUNGS

VISIBLE FROM THE OTHER SIDE.

01:19.740 --> 01:20.877
REALLY?

01:20.910 --> 01:23.140
NO WAY!

01:23.180 --> 01:24.374
I MEAN,
MAYBE THE BLOOD-ENGORGED CAVITY

01:24.410 --> 01:25.638

AND EXPAND

01:25.680 --> 01:27.341

I DON'T KNOW.

02:11.360 --> 02:12.793
THEY RUNNING ANOTHER STORY
ON THE WYLES DEATH?

02:12.830 --> 02:14.149
UH, I DON'T KNOW.

02:14.200 --> 02:15.497
UH, PERHAPS.

02:15.530 --> 02:17.293
GOSH, I HADN'T EVEN THOUGHT
ABOUT THAT.

02:17.330 --> 02:18.797
CARLTON, YOU'RE NAME'S
BEEN IN EVERY ARTICLE

02:18.830 --> 02:19.899

YOU'VE REOPENED THE CASE.

02:19.940 --> 02:21.362
HAS IT?
HUH.

02:21.400 --> 02:22.367
I TRY NOT TO READ
THE PAPERS TOO MUCH--

02:22.410 --> 02:23.434
VERY SKEWED.

02:23.470 --> 02:24.664
NO, I WAS JUST GONNA LOOK
AT THE CLASSIFIED ADS.

02:24.710 --> 02:25.665

02:29.250 --> 02:30.274
GAVE ME AN ADVANCED COPY.

02:30.310 --> 02:32.312
OH, BUT THERE'S NOTHING ABOUT
YOU OR WYLES IN THERE.

02:32.350 --> 02:33.419
WHAT?

02:33.450 --> 02:34.917
IMPOSSIBLE--I LEAKED THAT STUFF

02:34.950 --> 02:36.281

YESTERDAY.

HEY, DID YOU SAY
YOU WERE LOOKING

02:37.390 --> 02:39.449
FOR A BIG BOY,
LIKE A FULL-SIZE?

HI, I'M DETECTIVE O'HARA.
SOPHIE.

02:47.230 --> 02:47.924
WAIT, YOU'RE THE CURATOR?

02:47.960 --> 02:49.359
ASSISTANT CURATOR.

02:49.400 --> 02:50.469
I'D LIKE TO SPEAK
TO SOMEONE IN CHARGE.

02:50.500 --> 02:51.467
I AM IN CHARGE.

02:51.500 --> 02:52.933
SHE SOUNDS IN CHARGE.

02:52.970 --> 02:54.198
THE MUMMY ROOM'S
THIS WAY.

02:54.240 --> 02:55.195
PLEASE FOLLOW ME.

02:55.240 --> 02:56.639
WHERE'S THE CURATOR?

02:56.670 --> 02:58.501
HE'S IN EGYPT PROCURING
THE REST OF THIS COLLECTION,

02:58.540 --> 02:59.575
BUT I ASSURE YOU--

02:59.610 --> 03:00.577
OH, THERE'S NO NEED.

03:00.610 --> 03:01.679
HE'S BEEN WORKING
ALL NIGHT.

03:01.710 --> 03:02.904
CAN YOU CATCH US UP?

03:02.950 --> 03:04.542
THIS EXHIBIT
JUST OPENED YESTERDAY.

03:04.580 --> 03:06.309
I DON'T KNOW HOW
THIS IS POSSIBLE.

03:06.350 --> 03:07.942
IT WAS A PRANK OR SOME SORT
OF DARE.

03:07.980 --> 03:11.347
IT'S A 3,000-YEAR-OLD MUMMY
THAT'S MISSING, OFFICER.

03:11.390 --> 03:13.449
IT'S DETECTIVE AND IT'S NOT
LIKE IT WAS COVERED IN GOLD.

03:13.490 --> 03:14.514
I MEAN HE WASN'T A KING
OR A PRINCE

03:14.560 --> 03:15.709
OR EVEN A ROYAL FOOD TASTER.

03:15.760 --> 03:17.227
HE WAS JUST SOME GUY
WHO HAPPENED TO DIE,

03:17.260 --> 03:18.284
GOT HIMSELF WRAPPED UP,

03:18.330 --> 03:19.490
AND WAS FOUND IN A PRETI'Y,
CRACKED BOX.

03:19.530 --> 03:20.724
HE PROBABLY MUMMIFIED
HIMSELF.

03:20.760 --> 03:22.421
HE HASN'T HAD HIS COFFEE YET.

03:22.470 --> 03:23.619
HAS ANYONE FOUND
THE NIGHT WATCHMAN?

03:23.670 --> 03:24.796
OH, I'M AFRAID NOT.

03:24.830 --> 03:26.536

OF FELONY BURGLARY

03:28.370 --> 03:29.564
ON HIS RECORD.

03:29.610 --> 03:30.599
TECH NICALLY,
BURGLARY IS A FELONY.

03:30.640 --> 03:31.766
TWO CHARGES DROPPED.

03:31.810 --> 03:33.368
DON'T YOU PEOPLE
RUN BACKGROUND CHECKS?

03:33.410 --> 03:34.707
DOUG WAS A VERY GOOD EMPLOYEE

03:34.740 --> 03:36.378
WHO'S BEEN HERE SEVEN YEARS.

03:36.410 --> 03:37.968
AND WE HAVE A COMPLEX
SECURITY SYSTEM.

03:38.010 --> 03:39.910
WHICH WAS DUE TO BE
OVERHAULED LAST SPRING.

03:39.950 --> 03:40.871
WE PUSHED IT BACK.

03:40.920 --> 03:42.911
WE HAVE A VERY ABULIC
BOARD OF DIRECTORS.

03:42.950 --> 03:43.985
GOOD, I'D LIKE TO SPEAK
WITH EACH ONE OF THEM

03:44.020 --> 03:45.248
AS SOON AS THE SUN RISES.

03:45.290 --> 03:46.257
NOW IF YOU'LL FORGIVE US,

03:46.290 --> 03:47.484
WE HAVE SEVERAL
HIGH-PROFILE CASES

03:47.520 --> 03:48.851
THAT DON'T INVOLVE
ARCHAIC SECURITY SYSTEMS

03:48.890 --> 03:50.289
IN RUNDOWN BUILDINGS.

03:50.330 --> 03:52.525
O'HARA, PUT OUT AN APB
ON THE GUARD'S VEHICLE,

03:52.560 --> 03:53.527
LOOK UP THE WORD "ABULIC"

03:53.560 --> 03:56.791
AND MEET US BACK
AT THE STATION.

03:56.830 --> 03:58.468

JUST A MINUTE!

03:58.500 --> 04:00.365
I DON'T KNOW WHO YOU ARE,
DETECTIVE,

04:00.400 --> 04:01.230
BUT THIS WAS NO PRANK.

04:01.270 --> 04:03.465
THE ALARM WAS TRIGGERED
FROM THE INSIDE.

04:03.510 --> 04:05.660
AND ALTHOUGH OUR ARCHAIC
SECURITY FOOTAGE

04:05.710 --> 04:07.575
WAS LIMITED TO ROTATING SHOTS

04:07.610 --> 04:08.429
OF THE FOUR MAIN ROOMS,

04:08.480 --> 04:10.004
NOT A SINGLE IMAGE
SHOWS THE CULPRIT

04:10.050 --> 04:12.439
OR THE MUMMY BEING CARRIED
FROM THE BUILDING.

04:12.480 --> 04:13.879
SHE'S RIGHT.

04:13.920 --> 04:14.818
IT'S ALL RIGHT HERE.

04:14.850 --> 04:17.580
THE MUMMY DISAPPEARED
IN 15 SECONDS OR LESS

04:17.620 --> 04:19.656
AND OUR MAIN FEED
PICKED UP NONE OF IT.

04:19.690 --> 04:22.682
THIS ALL CRACKS OF SOMETHING
LARGER THAN PETI'Y CRIME.

04:22.730 --> 04:25.358
AND NOT TO SOUND
TOO SHIRLEY MCCLAIN,

04:25.390 --> 04:27.449
SCREAMS OF SOMETHING
POTENTIALLY. ..

04:27.500 --> 04:29.821
SUPERNATURAL.

04:29.870 --> 04:31.462
THIS REQUIRES SOMEONE
WITH SKILLS

04:31.500 --> 04:33.491
BEYOND THE NORMAL PERSON.

04:33.540 --> 04:36.703
I WANT HIM.

08:42.080 --> 08:43.684
NOT TO THE EXIT,

08:43.720 --> 08:44.948
BUT TO THE BODY
OF THE MUSEUM.

08:44.990 --> 08:48.687
GOOD, YOU'RE HERE.
ALL OF YOU IN MY OFFICE.

08:48.720 --> 08:51.280
SWEET, NOW YOU GOT US
IN TROUBLE.

09:00.070 --> 09:03.904
WHAT I HAVE TO SAY
IS VERY...DIFFICULT.

09:03.940 --> 09:05.009
IF THIS IN ANY WAY
PERTAINS

09:05.040 --> 09:06.064
TO LASSITER'S THIRD TESTICLE,

09:06.110 --> 09:08.738
I'M AFRAID WE ALREADY KNOW.

09:08.780 --> 09:10.975
THIS IS NO TIME FOR JOKES,
MR. SPENCER.

09:15.650 --> 09:18.619
WHEN I ACCEPTED THIS POSITION
ON AN INTERIM BASIS,

09:18.650 --> 09:20.288
THE AGREEMENT BETWEEN
MYSELF AND THE MAYOR

09:20.320 --> 09:21.912
WAS SHOULD THINGS
WORK OUT

09:21.960 --> 09:23.279
AT AN APPROPRIATE TIME,

09:23.330 --> 09:25.582
THE INTERIM WOULD BE
REMOVED FROM THE TITLE.

09:25.630 --> 09:27.951
AS YOU KNOW
THAT HAS NOT YET HAPPENED.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.797
AND RECENTLY I GAVE THE MAYOR
A DEADLINE,

09:29.830 --> 09:32.799
A DEADLINE THAT HAS PASSED
WITHOUT ANY SORT OF RESPONSE.

09:35.370 --> 09:38.168
SO EFFECTIVE FRIDAY,
I'M STEPPING DOWN AS CHIEF.

09:38.210 --> 09:39.734
WHAT?
I'M LEAVING.

09:39.780 --> 09:41.202
(Juliet)
YOU CAN'T DO THAT!
DO THEY KNOW?

09:41.240 --> 09:42.776
OH, THEY KNOW.

09:42.810 --> 09:43.902
I'LL WRITE A LETTER.

09:43.950 --> 09:45.349
I'LL START A PETITION.

09:45.380 --> 09:46.347
I'LL LEAK IT TO THE REPORTER
AT THE MIRROR.

09:46.380 --> 09:49.372
O'HARA, PLEASE.
THANK YOU.

09:49.420 --> 09:50.785
I APPRECIATE THE SENTIMENT,

09:50.820 --> 09:52.117
BUT THE DIE IS CAST.

09:52.150 --> 09:53.651
CHIEF...

09:53.690 --> 09:54.884
ARE YOU SURE YOU DON'T WANT
TO WAIT IT OUT

09:54.920 --> 09:55.887
JUST A LITTLE BIT LONGER?

09:55.920 --> 09:56.887
YOU NEVER--

09:56.930 --> 09:58.727
NO, MR. SPENCER.

09:58.760 --> 10:00.648
SO YOU'RE SAYING
THE JOB IS OPEN.

10:00.700 --> 10:01.724
WHAT?

10:01.760 --> 10:03.762
I MEAN, DID ANYONE MENTION
MY NAME?

10:03.800 --> 10:05.688
I BELIEVE THEY HAVE SOMEONE
IN MIND.

10:05.730 --> 10:07.231
BUT YOU DON'T KNOW
IF IT'S ME.

10:07.270 --> 10:08.692
(Shawn)
LOOK, CHIEF,

10:08.740 --> 10:10.207
LET ME JUST OFFER
THAT I THINK

10:10.240 --> 10:11.798
YOU'RE A GREAT CHIEF.

10:11.840 --> 10:14.832
AND, UH, I'M SURE THINGS
WILL ALL WORK OUT.

10:18.150 --> 10:19.139
THAT'S ALL FOR NOW.

10:28.890 --> 10:29.982
GO!

10:41.240 --> 10:43.162
WHAT ARE YOU WATCHING?

10:43.210 --> 10:45.235
SECURITY VIDEOS
FROM THE MUSEUM.

10:45.270 --> 10:46.339
VIDEOS?

10:46.370 --> 10:48.076
AS IN ACTUAL VIDEO TAPES?

10:48.110 --> 10:51.705
WELL, THEIR SYSTEM
COULD USE AN OVERHAUL.

10:51.750 --> 10:53.775
WHERE ARE THE TAPES
FROM THE OTHER CAMERAS?

10:53.820 --> 10:54.775
THAT'S IT.

10:54.820 --> 10:55.969
ONE TAPE?

10:56.020 --> 10:57.885
YEAH, IT'S ON A ROTATION.

10:57.920 --> 10:59.342
IT'S ACTUALLY NOT A BAD SYSTEM,
YOU KNOW?

10:59.390 --> 11:00.880
IT APPEARS YOU CAN'T LEAVE
THE MUSEUM

11:00.920 --> 11:02.456
WITHOUT GETTING CAUGHT
BY THE CAMERAS.

11:02.490 --> 11:03.718
SO IT'S EFFICIENT.

11:03.760 --> 11:05.079
MAYBE.

11:05.130 --> 11:06.085
WE SHOULD, UH,

11:06.130 --> 11:08.792
PROBABLY CHECK IT OUT
FOR OURSELVES, THOUGH.

11:08.830 --> 11:09.922
WHAT SAY YOU?
[claps]

11:09.970 --> 11:11.824
SURE.

11:11.870 --> 11:14.236
THERE'S ONE THING
YOU SHOULD PROBABLY KNOW

11:14.270 --> 11:15.294
BEFORE WE GET THERE.

11:19.410 --> 11:21.139
"PALEO-SLEUTH SHAWN SPENCER."

11:21.180 --> 11:22.807
I KNOW.
I DUG THAT THING UP TOO.

11:22.850 --> 11:24.147
GUS, BELIEVE ME,

11:24.180 --> 11:26.876
I WAS APPALLED MYSELF AT FIRST--
SICKENED, REALLY.

11:26.920 --> 11:28.342
BUT THEN I NOTICED,
LOOK,

11:28.380 --> 11:29.813
THE DIDN'T FORGET YOU
COMPLETELY.

11:29.850 --> 11:30.817
WHERE?

11:30.850 --> 11:31.817
THERE, RIGHT THERE!

11:31.850 --> 11:33.408
THE "PHOTO BY" SECTION.

11:33.460 --> 11:34.859
THAT SAYS "PHOTO BY
BRUTON GASTER."

11:34.890 --> 11:35.709
WELL I GAVE 'EM THE INFO

11:35.760 --> 11:36.988
WHEN I WAS DRIVING
THROUGH A TUNNEL,

11:37.030 --> 11:38.383
SO THAT PROBABLY PLAYED
A ROLE.

11:38.430 --> 11:39.419
I WANT A NEW PLAQUE, SHAWN.

11:39.460 --> 11:40.427
I WANT IT TOMORROW.

11:40.460 --> 11:42.428
I WANT MY NAME IN BIG YELLOW
LETTERS THAT BLINK.

11:42.460 --> 11:43.791
AND WHY WON'T YOU EVEN TELL ME

11:43.830 --> 11:44.865
WHAT THIS MUSEUM CASE
IS ABOUT?

11:44.900 --> 11:46.094
IN TIME,
IN TIME.

11:46.130 --> 11:47.836
GENTLEMEN, THANK YOU FOR COMING.

11:47.870 --> 11:49.906
MR. SPENCER, VERY GOOD
TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

11:49.940 --> 11:51.305
AND YOU MUST BE MR. GASTOR.

11:51.340 --> 11:53.399
GUSTER,
BURTON GUSTER.

11:53.440 --> 11:54.930
YOU PEOPLE EVER HEAR
OF SPELLCHECKER?

11:54.980 --> 11:56.106
(Shawn)
I WAS JUST GIVING
GASTY HERE

11:56.140 --> 11:56.947
ALL THE SPECIFICS.

11:56.980 --> 11:58.948
YES, WELL THE EXHIBIT
JUST OPENED

11:58.980 --> 12:00.777
YESTERDAY AFTERNOON
WITHOUT A HITCH.

12:00.820 --> 12:01.809
THE ALARM WENT OFF
AT 3:00 AM.

12:01.850 --> 12:02.839
I WAS HERE AT 5:00.

12:02.890 --> 12:03.879
A.M.?
YOU WERE NOT.

12:03.920 --> 12:04.944
I WAS, I WAS WORKING.
DOING WHAT?

12:04.990 --> 12:06.309
IT WAS A PRIVATE CASE.

12:06.350 --> 12:07.954
LOOK, I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD
BORE MS. BRIDGEWELL HERE

12:07.990 --> 12:10.049
WITH THE COMPLEXITIES
OF OUR OTHER INVESTIGATIONS.

12:10.090 --> 12:11.921
YOU'RE NOT TAILING CHEATING
BOYFRIENDS AGAIN, ARE YOU?

12:11.960 --> 12:13.257
GUS, COME ON.
I'M TRYING TO LOOK COOL.

12:13.300 --> 12:14.927
I TOLD YOU BEFORE, SHAWN.
WE ARE BIGGER THAN THAT.

12:14.960 --> 12:15.995
WE CLEARED, LIKE, 50 BUCKS
ON THE LAST ONE.

12:16.030 --> 12:18.965
GUS--PSYCHIC/CLIENT PRIVILEGE
AND WHATNOT, HUH?

12:19.000 --> 12:19.796
COME ON.

12:19.840 --> 12:20.795
SHALL WE CONTINUE?

12:20.840 --> 12:22.137
YES, THIS WAY.

12:22.170 --> 12:24.263
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?
YOU STOLE MY PICTURE!

12:24.310 --> 12:26.835
SO THE BULK OF THE ACTIVITY
SEEMS TO HAVE OCCURRED IN HERE.

12:26.880 --> 12:28.836
YES, I CAN SEE IT.

12:28.880 --> 12:30.802
THE LID SLIDING OFF

12:30.850 --> 12:31.839
THE BEING RISING UP,

12:31.880 --> 12:32.847
WALKING ACROSS THE FLOOR

12:32.880 --> 12:34.313
NOT UNLIKE AN EGYPTIAN.

12:34.350 --> 12:36.944
GUS COULD SHOW YOU.

12:36.990 --> 12:38.241
GUS!

12:38.290 --> 12:39.780
NOPE.
NO WHAT?

12:39.820 --> 12:41.253
YOU KNOW I'M NOT WALKING
INTO THAT ROOM, SHAWN.

12:41.290 --> 12:42.188
OH, COME ON, DUDE.

12:42.220 --> 12:44.450
I THOUGHT THIS WAS OVER
IN THE SIXTH GRADE.

12:44.490 --> 12:45.855
WHAT'S WRONG?

12:45.890 --> 12:47.858
HE WON'T BREAK THE PLANE
OF THE MUMMY ROOM.

12:47.900 --> 12:49.094
WHY NOT?

12:49.130 --> 12:51.928
HE'S AFRAID OF BEING CURSED.

12:51.970 --> 12:54.234
HE'S NOT THAT FAR
OFF BASE REALLY.

12:54.270 --> 12:55.965
PLEASE DON'T CODDLE HIM.

12:56.000 --> 12:57.035
FACT: EVERY ONE OF THOSE GUYS

12:57.070 --> 12:58.435
THAT UNEARTHED TUT'S TOMB--
CURSED.

12:58.470 --> 13:00.006
THEY'RE ALL DEAD NOW.

13:00.040 --> 13:02.008
OF COURSE THEY ARE.
THAT WAS OVER 80 YEARS AGO.

13:02.040 --> 13:03.439
COME ON, MAN.
THIS IS GONNA BE GOOD FOR YOU.

13:03.480 --> 13:04.879
WALK TO ME.

13:04.910 --> 13:05.877
FACE YOUR FEARS.

13:05.910 --> 13:07.116
YOU CAN TALK ALL YOU WANT,

13:07.150 --> 13:09.345
BUT FACTS AND LOGIC
WILL WIN OUT THIS TIME.

13:09.380 --> 13:10.984
FACTS AND LOGIC
ARE IN THE CORNER OF THE GUY

13:11.020 --> 13:13.113
WHO THINKS HE'S GONNA
GET HIS FACE MELTED OFF?

13:13.160 --> 13:15.355
I'M NOT HEARING IT, SHAWN.

13:15.390 --> 13:18.029
WELL YOU WANTED TO CHECK
THE CAMERAS, RIGHT?

13:18.060 --> 13:19.994
WILL YOU SET FOOT
IN THE SECURITY CAMERA ROOM?

13:24.500 --> 13:26.388
THIS SYSTEM'S ACTUALLY
BETTER THAN I THOUGHT.

13:26.430 --> 13:28.034
EVEN IF YOU MAKE IT OUT
OF ONE ROOM,

13:28.070 --> 13:29.196
YOU GET PICKED UP
IN THE NEXT ROOM IMMEDIATELY.

13:29.240 --> 13:30.332
YEAH.

13:30.370 --> 13:32.031
I'M GONNA TRY AND BEAT
THE SYSTEM.

13:32.070 --> 13:33.970
WATCH ME,
JUST ON THE CENTER SCREEN.

13:34.010 --> 13:35.079
SEE IF I CAN GET OUT.

13:35.110 --> 13:36.873
ALL I GOTTA DO
IS SIT HERE--FINE.

13:36.910 --> 13:38.047
YEAH, WE'LL COMMUNICATE
ON THE PHONE,

13:38.080 --> 13:39.047
SO GIVE ME A CALL.

13:39.080 --> 13:40.911
NO, YOU CALL ME.

13:40.950 --> 13:41.917
THIS IS MY WORK CELL.

13:41.950 --> 13:42.939
I'M NOT PAYING
FOR THAT CALL.

13:42.990 --> 13:44.014
GUS, IT'S USAGE MINUTES.

13:44.050 --> 13:45.881
IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHICH ONE OF US MAKES THE CALL.

13:45.920 --> 13:47.478
JUST CALL ME, SHAWN.

13:47.520 --> 13:49.920
FINE.

13:52.630 --> 13:54.427
I'M SORRY,
I CAN'T LET THIS GO.

13:54.460 --> 13:56.348
IT'S A MONTHLY PLAN.
IT'S A MINUTES PLAN.

13:56.400 --> 13:57.560
CAN WE GET STARTED
WITH THIS THING NOW?

13:57.600 --> 13:58.965
EH.

14:11.110 --> 14:12.099
I SAW THAT.

14:12.150 --> 14:14.914
GOT IT ON TWO ANGLES.

14:14.950 --> 14:17.589
DO YOU WANT TO GIVE THIS UP
ANY TIME SOON?

14:20.490 --> 14:21.957
YOU'RE CRAWLING.

14:23.430 --> 14:24.488
I SEE YOU, SHAWN.

14:24.530 --> 14:25.588
YOU'RE BEHIND THE PLANT.

14:27.130 --> 14:29.121
SEE YOU THERE.
SEE YOU THERE.

14:29.160 --> 14:30.923
THE PLANT IS MOVING
ACROSS THE ROOM, SHAWN.

14:35.270 --> 14:37.135
LEAVE THAT POOR LADY ALONE,
SHAWN.

14:39.340 --> 14:40.477
YOU'RE USING THE CARPET?

14:40.510 --> 14:41.602
REALLY?

14:41.640 --> 14:42.436
WAIT A MINUTE--

14:42.480 --> 14:44.607
I ALMOST BOUGHT THAT
FOR A SECOND.

14:44.650 --> 14:47.312
YOU'RE USING THE WOLF PELT?

14:47.350 --> 14:49.147
THIS IS LIKE WATCHING ENTRAPMENT

14:49.180 --> 14:50.613
IF INSTEAD
OF CATHERINE ZETA-JONES

14:50.650 --> 14:52.538
THEY HAD SOME GUY
WITH PANCAKE BUTT.

14:52.590 --> 14:56.151
I DO NOT HAVE PANCAKE BUTT!

14:56.190 --> 14:57.350
(Shawn)
WHA'I'I'AYA GOT?
YOU GOT SOMETHING?

14:57.390 --> 14:58.425
(Gus on phone)
YEP.

14:58.460 --> 14:59.427
REALLY?
YEP.

14:59.460 --> 15:00.427
YOU CAN SEE ME RIGHT NOW?

15:00.460 --> 15:01.927
HORRID,
SHAWNY BOY.

15:01.960 --> 15:02.927
HORRID.

15:02.970 --> 15:03.925
HI!

15:03.970 --> 15:05.198
HELLO!

15:05.230 --> 15:07.596
GREAT, NOW I GOTTA WATCH THIS?

15:07.640 --> 15:09.096
[phone beeps]

15:09.140 --> 15:10.698
YOU'RE MUTING ME?

15:10.740 --> 15:12.207
FOR THE FIRST INTERESTING THING
THAT'S HAPPENED?

15:12.240 --> 15:14.538
[imitating Shawn]
"LOOK AT ME, LOOK AT ME.

15:14.580 --> 15:15.979
"I LOVE MY HAIR.

15:16.010 --> 15:17.204
"I CAN MAKE OBSCURE
'8OS REFERENCES

15:17.250 --> 15:18.547
"THAT NOBODY UNDERSTANDS.

15:18.580 --> 15:19.945
"LAUGH AT ME.

"I HAVE A MOTORCYCLE,

15:25.090 --> 15:26.409
BUT I NEVER SEEM
TO BE RIDING IT."

15:26.450 --> 15:28.156
HOW ABOUT THIS?
ARE YOU SEEING THIS?

15:28.190 --> 15:28.884
YEP.

15:28.920 --> 15:31.081
HOW ABOUT NOW?
YOU SEE THIS?

15:31.130 --> 15:32.256
TERRIBLE.

15:32.290 --> 15:33.689
HOW ABOUT THIS?
YOU SEEING THIS?

15:33.730 --> 15:35.049
IF YOU'RE GONNA HIDE
UNDER A BARREL,

15:35.100 --> 15:36.590
DON'T PUT THE PHONE
NEXT TO YOUR EAR.

15:36.630 --> 15:37.961
YOU'RE GETTING ALL OF THIS?

15:38.000 --> 15:39.069
YOU CAN SEE ALL OF THIS?

15:39.100 --> 15:41.034
YEP.

15:41.070 --> 15:42.628
WHOA, I LOST YOU.

15:42.670 --> 15:44.467
OH--

THERE YOU ARE.

15:46.170 --> 15:48.104
HA! I GOT YOU.

15:48.140 --> 15:49.937
FOR ONE SECOND, SHAWN.

15:53.050 --> 15:54.142
TRYING THAT CORNER AGAIN?

15:54.180 --> 15:55.272
PLEASE.
[chuckles]

15:55.320 --> 15:56.275
[dial tone on phone]

15:56.320 --> 15:58.117
SHAWN?

15:58.150 --> 15:59.981
EH...GREAT.

16:00.020 --> 16:02.079
NOW YOU WORE DOWN
MY BATTERY.

16:04.090 --> 16:07.025
WHERE ARE YOU?

16:10.670 --> 16:12.399
HOW ABOUT NOW?

16:14.700 --> 16:16.031
BINGO.

16:16.070 --> 16:17.662
I'M SURE YOU CAN UNDERSTAND,

16:17.710 --> 16:19.769
MR. WYLES, WHY I'VE BEEN
SO MOTIVATED

16:19.810 --> 16:22.074
BY WHAT I'VE UNCOVERED
IN THIS INVESTIGATION.

16:22.110 --> 16:23.702
WELL, ALL I KNOW,
DETECTIVE,

16:23.750 --> 16:24.774
IS I CERTAINLY SEEM TO SEE

16:24.810 --> 16:26.107
YOUR NAME IN THE PAPER
EVERY DAY.

16:26.150 --> 16:27.640
REALLY?

16:27.680 --> 16:29.113
WHICH PAPER WOULD THAT BE,

16:29.150 --> 16:30.242
BECAUSE YOU KNOW I'VE MISSED
SOME OF THE COVERAGE.

16:30.290 --> 16:31.245
CAN WE JUST GET ON
WITH WHAT YOU WANT?

16:31.290 --> 16:32.314
OF COURSE.

16:32.350 --> 16:35.057
IT'S REALLY JUST MORE
OF A FORMALITY THAN ANYTHING.

16:35.090 --> 16:36.318
I WASN'T EVEN GOING
TO CALL YOU IN TODAY.

16:36.360 --> 16:38.385
I JUST NEED TO GO OVER
A FEW BANK RECORDS

16:38.430 --> 16:39.658
AND SEE SOME PAPERS

16:39.690 --> 16:40.759
AND EXHUME YOUR FATHER'S BODY.

16:40.800 --> 16:42.529
I'M SORRY.
WHAT WAS THAT LAST ONE?

16:42.560 --> 16:45.097
OH, UH, IT'S JUST MORE
OF A TECHNICAL DETAIL

16:45.130 --> 16:46.119
THAN ANYTHING--

16:46.170 --> 16:48.058
EXHUMING YOUR FATHER'S BODY.

16:48.100 --> 16:49.192
I MEAN, YOU WOULDN'T EVEN
HAVE TO BE THERE.

16:49.240 --> 16:51.231
I COULD HAVE HIM BACK
IN ETERNAL SLUMBER BY NOON...

16:51.270 --> 16:53.204
1:45 AT THE LATEST.

16:53.240 --> 16:55.379
(Gus)
THIS PLACE IS GONNA CLOSE
SOON.

16:55.410 --> 16:56.434
NO, IT'S NOT.

16:56.480 --> 16:57.742
SHAWN, I WAS IN THERE
FOREVER.

16:57.780 --> 16:59.077
SOMEBODY'S SHUTTING OFF
THE LIGHTS

16:59.110 --> 17:00.145
WITH US IN HERE.

17:00.180 --> 17:02.045
PRETTY SURE THAT'S A TIMER.

17:02.080 --> 17:04.810
WHY WOULD THEY SET A TIMER
WITH PEOPLE STILL IN HERE?

17:04.850 --> 17:07.387
'CAUSE THE MUSEUM CLOSED
20 MINUTES AGO?

17:11.460 --> 17:13.155
HOW DID THEY CLOSE IT
WITH US INSIDE?

17:13.200 --> 17:16.522
WELL, REMEMBER I SAID
I TALKED TO SOPHIE THE CURATOR?

17:16.560 --> 17:17.595
SHE'S VERY SWEET,
BY THE WAY.

17:17.630 --> 17:19.120
SHE LOVES RED ROBIN.

17:19.170 --> 17:22.196
ISN'T THAT A STRANGE
FAVORITE RESTAURANT.

17:22.240 --> 17:23.798
YOU'RE GOING BEHIND
THE TARP?

17:23.840 --> 17:25.262
REALLY?

17:25.310 --> 17:27.198
THERE'S AN EXIT BEHIND THE TARP?

17:27.240 --> 17:29.333
YOU'RE PROBABLY GONNA BE EATEN
BY CARPET BEETLES.

17:29.380 --> 17:32.144
LOOK, I DISCOVERED A NUMBER
OF INTRIGUING THINGS

17:32.180 --> 17:33.647
WHEN I WAS FIGURING OUT
HOW TO CRACK

17:33.680 --> 17:35.272
THE SECURITY CAMERAS,

17:35.320 --> 17:37.185
INCLUDING AN EXHIBIT
THAT LOOKED LIKE

17:37.220 --> 17:38.118
IT HAD ALREADY BEEN
BROKEN INTO,

17:38.150 --> 17:39.185
SO WHAT I'M THINKING IS

17:39.220 --> 17:40.380
WHOEVER DID IT MIGHT COME BACK

17:40.420 --> 17:41.717
BECAUSE ANYONE ON THE INSIDE
KNOWS

17:41.760 --> 17:43.819
THAT THERE'S NO NIGHT GUARD
ON DUTY

17:43.860 --> 17:45.122
AND...

17:45.160 --> 17:46.252
AND WHAT?

17:46.290 --> 17:47.791
SOPHIE SAID IT WAS COOL.

17:47.830 --> 17:48.797
WHAT WAS COOL?

17:48.830 --> 17:49.922
COME ON, MAN.

17:49.960 --> 17:51.120
HAVEN'T YOU EVER WANTED
TO SPEND A NIGHT IN THE MUSEUM?

17:51.170 --> 17:52.228
YOU KNOW, DO IT UP

17:52.270 --> 17:53.237
WITH ALL THE STUFFED
CREATURES

17:53.270 --> 17:55.090
AND THE BONES?

17:55.140 --> 17:56.596
NO, SHAWN, I HAVEN'T.

17:56.640 --> 17:58.198
I CAN'T SPEND THE NIGHT
IN THE MUSEUM.

17:58.240 --> 18:00.276
I DON'T HAVE MY TOOTHBRUSH.

18:00.310 --> 18:01.470
I DON'T HAVE ANY
OF MY MULTIVITAMINS.

18:01.510 --> 18:03.398
AND OH, YEAH, I DON'T WANT
MY SOUL

18:03.450 --> 18:05.372
SUFFERING ETERNAL DAMNATION

18:05.410 --> 18:07.219
FOR DISRUPTING THE SLEEP
OF AN EGYPTIAN CANAL DIGGER.

18:07.250 --> 18:08.547
COME ON, DUDE!

18:08.580 --> 18:09.672
WITH HASTINGS ON THE LAM,

18:09.720 --> 18:11.608
THEY'RE FRESH OUT
OF NIGHT WATCHMEN.

18:11.650 --> 18:13.857
SOPHIE WAS ACTUALLY QUITE HAPPY
THAT I OFFERED.

18:13.890 --> 18:16.381
SHE'S TAKING ME TO DINNER.

18:16.420 --> 18:19.218
WHAT DO THEY HAVE AT RED ROBIN?

18:22.360 --> 18:23.861
OH, COME ON, GUS.

18:23.900 --> 18:24.889
THEY DIDN'T GET WHAT THEY WERE
LOOKING FOR THE FIRST TIME.

18:24.930 --> 18:26.488
MAYBE THEY'LL BREAK IN
AGAIN.

18:26.530 --> 18:28.191
WE'LL BE HERE TO CATCH 'EM
RED-HANDED.

18:28.240 --> 18:29.639
WON'T THAT BE COOL?

18:29.670 --> 18:31.900
DUDE, THERE'S PROBABLY A SENSOR
OF SOME SORT.

18:31.940 --> 18:33.407
TAKE A STEP BACK.

18:35.280 --> 18:36.429
OKAY, NOW TRY IT.

18:36.480 --> 18:37.447
HUH!

18:37.480 --> 18:38.799
[Gus grunts]

18:40.880 --> 18:42.142
WHAT'S ON THE HILL?

18:42.180 --> 18:43.681
(Gus)
THAT'S FREEDOM, SHAWN.

18:43.720 --> 18:44.880
(Shawn)
DOES THAT LOOK LIKE
A CAMERA?

18:44.920 --> 18:46.808
NO, NO ONE'S GONNA LEAVE
THEIR CAMERA

18:46.850 --> 18:48.659
OUTSIDE IN THE MIST
SO IT CAN GET RUINED.

18:48.690 --> 18:49.759
[cell phone rings]
LOOKS LIKE A CAMERA TO ME.

18:49.790 --> 18:50.757
HELLO?

18:50.790 --> 18:51.757
WE CAUGHT A BREAK.

18:51.790 --> 18:53.223
WE CAUGHT A BREAK.

18:53.260 --> 18:54.454
HASTINGS, THAT SECURITY GUARD

18:54.500 --> 18:56.422
FROM THE MUSEUM
WHO'S STILL MISSING,

18:56.460 --> 18:57.427
HAD A FEW ASSAULT CHARGES
ON HIS RECORD

18:57.470 --> 18:58.425
THAT NEVER WENT TO TRIAL.

18:58.470 --> 18:59.368
OOH!

18:59.400 --> 19:01.231
HASTINGS IS WAY MORE VIOLENT
THAN WE THOUGHT.

19:01.270 --> 19:02.828
OH, AND WE FOUND THE CAR
FINALLY.

19:02.870 --> 19:04.406
THEY FOUND HIS CAR.

19:04.440 --> 19:05.407
YEAH, IT WAS IN THE SHOP
ACTUALLY.

19:05.440 --> 19:06.668
BUT YOU DIDN'T FIND HIM?

19:06.710 --> 19:07.870
NO, THE SHOP GAVE HIM
A LOANER.

19:07.910 --> 19:08.877
I JUST THOUGHT I WOULD
LET YOU KNOW,

19:08.910 --> 19:09.729
GIVE YOU A HEADS UP,

19:09.780 --> 19:10.940
SEE IF YOU COME UP
WITH ANYTHING.

19:10.980 --> 19:12.174
WHAT KIND OF CAR
IS THE LOANER?

19:12.210 --> 19:15.213
GRAY GMC PICKUP.

19:38.570 --> 19:39.867
DON'T BE MAD.

19:39.910 --> 19:41.434
WHY WOULD I BE MAD?

19:41.480 --> 19:42.629
I'M LOCKED IN A MUSEUM

19:42.680 --> 19:44.443
WITH POSSIBLY A VIOLENT
CRIMINAL

19:44.480 --> 19:45.947
AND PROBABLY AN ANGRY
MUMMY SPIRIT.

19:45.980 --> 19:47.845
OH, AND HERE'S A BONUS:

19:47.880 --> 19:48.949
WE HAVE NO PHONES.

19:48.980 --> 19:50.584
I TOLD YOU TO CHARGE
THAT PHONE.

19:50.620 --> 19:51.848
YOU DID NOT.

19:51.890 --> 19:53.517
I DIDN'T?

19:53.560 --> 19:55.482
DOES THINKING IT COUNT?

19:55.520 --> 19:56.680
[scoffs]

19:56.720 --> 19:58.381
(Shawn)
THEY MIGHT HAVE A SNACK BAR.

19:58.430 --> 20:00.751
YOU KNOW, MAYBE THAT TRUCK
WASN'T GRAY, DUDE.

20:00.800 --> 20:03.428
MAYBE IT WAS, LIKE,
A DEEP MIDNIGHT BLUE

20:03.470 --> 20:05.597
OR A BLACK OR A NICE
KELLY GREEN.

20:05.630 --> 20:06.858
IT'S HARD TO KNOW FOR SURE.

20:06.900 --> 20:07.969
YOU KNOW,
THE CONES IN THE EYES

20:08.000 --> 20:09.558
MAKE IT POSSIBLE
TO SEE AT NIGHT.

20:09.600 --> 20:10.532
I KNOW HOW THE EYES WORK,
SHAWN.

20:10.570 --> 20:12.959
I JUST HOPE I STILL HAVE MINE
IN THE MORNING.

20:13.010 --> 20:14.534
WHERE EXACTLY ARE WE?
HE'S HERE.

20:14.580 --> 20:16.002
HE'S GONNA COME BACK.

20:16.040 --> 20:16.972
HE'S GONNA KILL US.

20:17.010 --> 20:19.478
DUDE, I NEVER SAID HASTINGS
STOLE THE THING.

20:19.510 --> 20:21.671
NO, YOU THINK THE ACTUAL MUMMY
WALKED OUT.

20:21.720 --> 20:23.017
THAT MAKES ME FEEL BETTER.

20:23.050 --> 20:25.439
DON'T GO ALL
"GLASS HALF EMPTY" ON ME.

20:25.490 --> 20:26.980
LET ME SHOW YOU
WHAT I FOUND.

20:27.020 --> 20:29.386
WHAT IS WRONG...

20:29.420 --> 20:30.455
WITH THIS FLAG?

20:30.490 --> 20:31.457
EVERYTHING.

20:31.490 --> 20:32.582
BESIDES THAT.

20:32.630 --> 20:34.495
I DON'T KNOW.
IT'S UPSIDE-DOWN.

20:34.530 --> 20:35.895
AND BACKWARDS.
WHAT'S YOUR POINT?

20:37.730 --> 20:38.719
IT'S DUST GATHERED

20:38.770 --> 20:40.590
ON THE BOTTOM OF THE FRAME.

20:40.640 --> 20:42.596
THAT MEANS SOMEBODY EITHER
TURNED IT UPSIDE-DOWN

20:42.640 --> 20:44.232
OR KNOCKED IT OVER.

20:47.040 --> 20:48.871
WHOA, I LOST YOU FOR A SECOND.

20:48.910 --> 20:50.275
THERE YOU ARE.

20:50.310 --> 20:51.447
(Shawn)
AND THIS LITTLE NOOK

20:51.480 --> 20:52.606
IS NOT IN CAMERA RANGE.

20:52.650 --> 20:53.469
IT'S NOT A NOOK.

20:53.520 --> 20:54.509
WHAT WOULD YOU CALL IT?

20:54.550 --> 20:55.710
IT'S CLEARLY NOT
A CORNER.

20:55.750 --> 20:57.513
CRANNY?
WILL YOU SIGN OFF ON CRANNY?

20:57.550 --> 20:58.517
WHY AM I HERE, SHAWN?

20:58.550 --> 21:01.314
BECAUSE SOMEBODY DIDN'T WANT

21:01.360 --> 21:03.351
THE CAMERA TO SEE WHATEVER
HAPPENED IN THIS CRANNY.

21:03.390 --> 21:04.618
I NEVER SIGNED OFF ON CRANNY.

21:04.660 --> 21:05.456
THERE'S NOTHING HERE, GUS.

21:05.490 --> 21:07.629
IT'S JUST A BUNCH
OF OLD GUNS.

21:10.600 --> 21:12.397
AND NOT EVEN NICE ONES
AT THAT.

21:12.430 --> 21:13.499
THE LEXAN GLASS CASE
THAT HOUSES IT

21:13.540 --> 21:15.030
IS WORTH MORE.

21:15.070 --> 21:16.867
LEXAN GLASS?
YEAH, IT'S BULLETPROOF.

21:16.900 --> 21:18.504
WELL, IT WOULD HAVE TO BE

21:18.540 --> 21:19.632
IN CASE THE GUNS DECIDED

21:19.670 --> 21:20.876
TO FIRE THEMSELVES.

21:20.910 --> 21:21.934
[mutters]
LEXAN GLASS.

21:21.980 --> 21:22.969
WHAT?

21:23.010 --> 21:24.602
THAT'S COMMON KNOWLEDGE,
SHAWN.

21:24.650 --> 21:25.548
PEOPLE KNOW THAT.

21:25.580 --> 21:27.468
WHO, PEOPLE
IN CHARLTON HESTON'S HOUSE?

21:27.520 --> 21:29.613
(Gus)
YES, AND YOUR MAMA.

21:35.520 --> 21:36.487
DID YOU HEAR THAT?

21:36.520 --> 21:38.556
NOBODY'S HERE BUT US.

21:38.590 --> 21:41.093
I TRIED, SHAWN.
I CAN'T DO THIS.

21:41.130 --> 21:42.995
GUS, DON'T BE
A TRAVELING WILBURY.

21:43.030 --> 21:44.019
LOOK, CHRISTINE'S HERE.

21:44.070 --> 21:45.662
WILL YOU STOP IT, SHAWN?

21:45.700 --> 21:47.691
RELAX, IT'S NOT EVEN
THE RIGHT COLOR.

21:47.740 --> 21:49.332
DUDE.

21:49.370 --> 21:51.565
WE HAVE GOT TO GET
ONE OF THESE FOR THE OFFICE.

21:51.610 --> 21:53.601
HOW MUCH YOU THINK
THESE THINGS RUN?

21:53.640 --> 21:55.471
(Gus)
I DON'T KNOW.

21:55.510 --> 21:56.534
HOW HEAW ARE THEY?

21:56.580 --> 21:58.002
[refrigerator
motor starting]

21:58.050 --> 22:01.577
THAT WAS ACTUALLY
KIND OF SCARY, GUS.

22:01.620 --> 22:02.644
OH, COME ON, DUDE!

22:02.680 --> 22:05.080
IT'S JUST THE MOTOR
ON THE FRIDGE!

22:05.120 --> 22:10.649
OF COURSE, WHY WOULD
AN EXHIBIT BE PLUGGED IN?

22:12.930 --> 22:14.625
THE SIGN SAYS
DO NOT TOUCH, SHAWN.

22:14.660 --> 22:16.992
NOT ANYMORE.

22:17.030 --> 22:18.463
IT'S STUCK, THOUGH.

22:18.500 --> 22:19.819
IT'S SUPPOSED
TO BE STUCK.

22:19.870 --> 22:21.360
TO KEEP PEOPLE LIKE YOU OUT.

22:21.400 --> 22:22.594
PEOPLE WHO WHAT?

22:22.640 --> 22:23.607
PEOPLE WHO SPEND THE NIGHT
IN MUSEUMS

22:23.640 --> 22:25.005
TO INVESTIGATE MUMMIES
THAT MAY HAVE WALKED OUT

22:25.040 --> 22:26.405
ON THEIR OWN?

22:27.780 --> 22:29.736
OH!

22:35.180 --> 22:39.981
[birds chirping,
rooster crowing]

22:51.770 --> 22:54.739
[car engine starting]

22:54.770 --> 22:56.192
[tires screeching]

23:00.070 --> 23:01.606
YOU ARE HERE.

23:01.640 --> 23:03.005
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

23:03.040 --> 23:04.007
BIDDING FOR TALISMANS.

23:04.050 --> 23:05.699
TALISMEN.

23:05.750 --> 23:06.808
I DON'T CARE
WHAT THEY'RE CALLED, SHAWN.

23:06.850 --> 23:08.943
I'M ACQUIRING PROTECTION
FOR THE SPIRITUAL INJUSTICE

23:08.980 --> 23:10.174
WE CAUSED IN THE MUSEUM.

23:10.220 --> 23:12.108
YOU CAN BUY WOLFSBANE
ONLINE?

23:12.150 --> 23:13.412
IN BULK.

23:13.460 --> 23:15.018
NOW I JUST GOTTA
FIND SOMEBODY

23:15.060 --> 23:16.459
TO LOAN ME A CAT.

23:16.490 --> 23:17.457
YOU GOT MCNABB'S NUMBER?

23:17.490 --> 23:18.627
OH, COME ON, GUS.

23:18.660 --> 23:19.752
I THOUGHT THAT,
AT THE VERY LEAST,

23:19.790 --> 23:21.428
FINDING THE GUARD DEAD

23:21.460 --> 23:22.358
WOULD HELP YOU
JUMP ON THE BANDWAGON THAT,

23:22.400 --> 23:23.992
HEY, THIS IS A REAL
FLESH AND BLOOD KILLER.

23:26.230 --> 23:27.197
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.

23:27.230 --> 23:28.561
YOU HAVE NO PROOF.

23:28.600 --> 23:30.636
OKAY, FINE, I'M SORRY.

23:30.670 --> 23:31.568
I'M SORRY
THAT I DIDN'T TELL YOU

23:31.610 --> 23:32.907
I SIGNED US UP
FOR NIGHT GUARD DUTY.

23:32.940 --> 23:33.907
AND I'M SORRY
I DIDN'T TELL YOU

23:33.940 --> 23:34.770
THERE WAS A MUMMY INVOLVED.

23:34.810 --> 23:36.937
BUT WE HAVE
A LEGITIMATE TRAIL NOW.

23:36.980 --> 23:38.504
THE COPS
ARE TAKING THIS SERIOUSLY.

23:38.550 --> 23:39.608
I NEED YOU!

23:39.650 --> 23:41.709
I NEED THE SWEET BLUE SHIRT,
I NEED THE PANTS.

23:41.750 --> 23:42.842
I NEED THE WINSOME SMILE
THAT HIDES THE SAD

23:42.880 --> 23:44.108
JAMAICAN CLOWN INSIDE.

23:44.150 --> 23:45.845
WE NEED TO CALL LASSITER

23:45.890 --> 23:47.585
AND WE ARE NOT
GOING BACK TO THE MUSEUM.

23:47.620 --> 23:49.656
NO MORE MUMMY ROOM,
NO MORE SPOOKY STUFF.

23:49.690 --> 23:52.659
I PROMISE.

23:52.690 --> 23:54.021
LET'S GO.
BRING IT UP!

23:55.830 --> 23:57.559
HE'S EXHUMING A BODY?

23:57.600 --> 24:00.228
HE IS CASUALLY DISTURBING
WHAT SHOULD BE THE PASSING

24:00.270 --> 24:01.737
OF A GREAT
AND DIGNIFIED MAN.

24:01.770 --> 24:03.601
YEAH, HE DOES THAT.

24:05.640 --> 24:07.505
WHOA.
WHITE SOCKS, BLACK SHOES.

24:07.540 --> 24:08.905
WHAT'S THE RULE ON THAT?

24:08.940 --> 24:10.168
DON'T YOU HAVE
TO BE WEARING JEANS?

24:10.210 --> 24:11.677
WHAT'S THE RULE?

24:11.710 --> 24:13.200
OH, COME ON, DUDE.

24:13.250 --> 24:14.569
I HONESTLY HAD NO IDEA
HE WAS GONNA BE

24:14.620 --> 24:15.871
PULLING A CORPSE
FROM THE GROUND.

24:15.920 --> 24:17.217
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT, SHAWN.

24:17.250 --> 24:18.911
I HONESTLY DIDN'T KNOW
I WAS GONNA BE PUTTING

24:18.950 --> 24:20.486
MY FOOT IN YOUR ASS.

24:20.520 --> 24:22.750
LIFE'S FULL OF SURPRISES.

24:22.790 --> 24:24.724
I GOT THE CORONER'S REPORT
ON THE GUARD HASTINGS.

24:24.760 --> 24:26.159
AT LEAST STAY FOR THIS,

24:26.190 --> 24:27.748
SEE HOW SILLY IT IS
TO BE AFRAID OF MUMMIES.

24:27.800 --> 24:28.789
WHAT DO YOU GOT, JULES?

24:28.830 --> 24:30.695
YOU'RE NOT GONNA LIKE IT.

24:30.730 --> 24:31.992
WE'RE NOT GONNA LIKE IT.

24:32.030 --> 24:33.099
I'M SURE WE'LL BE ABLE
TO MAKE SOMETHING OF IT.

24:33.130 --> 24:34.666
HASTINGS WAS STRANGLED
TO DEATH.

24:34.700 --> 24:36.691
HA!
NO MAGIC INVOLVED THERE.

24:36.740 --> 24:38.002
AND CORRECT ME
IF I'M WRONG JULES,

24:38.040 --> 24:40.258
BUT YOU CAN ACTUALLY
GET FINGERPRINTS

24:40.310 --> 24:41.572
OFF STRANGULATION VICTIMS.

24:41.610 --> 24:42.577
I'M AFRAID
THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE.

24:42.610 --> 24:43.474
WHY IS THAT?

24:43.510 --> 24:45.569
THE HAND WAS WRAPPED
IN SOME SORT OF CLOTH.

24:45.610 --> 24:46.577
CLOTH?

24:46.610 --> 24:47.577
THERE WERE LINEN FIBERS

24:47.620 --> 24:49.019
EMBEDDED
INTO THE GUARD'S NECK.

24:49.050 --> 24:51.189
CLEARLY THAT WAS JUST
TO COVER HIS PRINTS.

24:51.220 --> 24:54.280
WE ALSO FOUND DUST AND SPORES
THAT WEREN'T FROM THIS AREA.

24:54.320 --> 24:56.811
WELL, MAYBE THE CLEANING CREW
DIDN'T COME AROUND.

24:56.860 --> 24:58.987
ONLY IF THEY DIDN'T COME AROUND
FOR OVER 3,000 YEARS.

24:59.030 --> 25:02.022
THE SPORES CAME
FROM INSIDE THE COFFIN.

25:02.060 --> 25:04.995
THANKS, JULES.

25:13.780 --> 25:14.633
FINALLY!

25:14.680 --> 25:16.705
FINALLY WHAT?

25:16.740 --> 25:18.298
I'VE BEEN LEAVING MESSAGES
ON YOUR PHONE.

25:18.350 --> 25:19.942
YEAH, I SORT
OF DROPPED MY PHONE.

25:19.980 --> 25:21.811
YEAH, WHAT'D I TELL YOU
ABOUT TAKING CARE OF YOUR STUFF?

25:21.850 --> 25:22.748
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU'RE RIGHT.

25:22.780 --> 25:24.748
FIRST MY TRICYCLE
OUT IN THE YARD, NOW THIS.

25:24.790 --> 25:26.018
I SEE A PATTERN
DEVELOPING HERE.

25:26.050 --> 25:27.085
ALL RIGHT, LOOK, SHAWN,

25:27.120 --> 25:28.553
I WAS HOPING
WE COULD TALK ALONE.

25:28.590 --> 25:29.614
NO OFFENSE, GUS.

25:29.660 --> 25:30.820
HEY.

25:30.860 --> 25:32.259
OH NO NO, DON'T YOU DARE.

25:32.290 --> 25:33.791
WE ARE HERE TO TALK TO YOU
AND THIS IS URGENT.

25:33.830 --> 25:34.899
WELL, SO IS MINE.

25:34.930 --> 25:35.919
OURS INVOLVES A DEAD GUY.

25:36.830 --> 25:39.196
WHY DO YOU ALWAYS
HAVE TO WIN, SHAWN?

25:39.230 --> 25:40.197
'CAUSE WE'RE WINNERS.

25:40.230 --> 25:41.891
FINE, WHAT IS IT?
GO AHEAD.

25:41.940 --> 25:47.901
OKAY, WHAT DO YOU DO
WHEN YOUR BEST SUSPECT...

25:47.940 --> 25:49.202
UH, SORT OF, JUST...

25:49.240 --> 25:51.049
SAY IT, SHAWN.

25:51.080 --> 25:54.277
DOESN'T EXIST ANYMORE?

25:54.320 --> 25:55.639
PEOPLE DISAPPEAR
ALL THE TIME, SHAWN.

25:55.680 --> 25:56.669
SOME ARE VERY GOOD AT IT.

25:56.720 --> 25:57.539
ESPECIALLY A CAREER CRIMINAL.

25:57.590 --> 25:59.649
YEAH, THIS IS A LITTLE
MORE COMPLICATED.

25:59.690 --> 26:00.782
LOOK, IT DOESN'T MATTER

26:00.820 --> 26:01.787
WHO YOU'RE TALKING
ABOUT HERE, SHAWN.

26:01.820 --> 26:02.980
BUT WHEN THE TRAIL
GOES COLD,

26:03.020 --> 26:03.987
YOU DO
WHAT EVERY GOOD COP DOES.

26:04.030 --> 26:05.019
YOU FOLLOW THE TIMELINE.

26:05.060 --> 26:05.879
YOU TRACE BACK THE STEPS

26:05.930 --> 26:07.693
THAT LED TO THE TRAIL
GOING COLD.

26:07.730 --> 26:08.856
BACKGROUND CHECK.
EXACTLY.

26:08.900 --> 26:10.629
PERFECT.
PERFECT, DAD!

26:10.670 --> 26:11.921
BUT I WANNA SEE YOU LATER,
WITHOUT GUS.

26:11.970 --> 26:13.790
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU.

26:13.840 --> 26:16.058
OKAY, WHAT IS THIS?

26:16.100 --> 26:17.237
WHAT IS ALL THIS
"WITHOUT GUS" STUFF?

26:17.270 --> 26:18.601
I MEAN, IT'S GUS.
JUST SAY IT.

26:18.640 --> 26:19.959
SAY WHAT IT IS.
WHAT IS IT?

26:20.010 --> 26:20.977
OKAY.

26:21.010 --> 26:22.898
ALL RIGHT, UM...

26:22.940 --> 26:27.616
I GOT A PHONE CALL
A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO AND, UM...

26:27.650 --> 26:29.618
I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU HAVE ANY PLANS,

26:29.650 --> 26:32.244
BUT, UM...

26:32.290 --> 26:34.850
ARE YOU BUSY ON SATURDAY?

26:34.890 --> 26:36.357
YOU...

26:36.390 --> 26:38.984
YOU WANT ME TO COME WITH YOU
TO AWKWARD CLASS?

26:39.030 --> 26:41.328
FORGET IT.

26:45.100 --> 26:46.089
SEE YA!

26:47.400 --> 26:48.992
DETECT IVES, THAT'S VERY
THOUGHTFUL OF YOU,

26:49.040 --> 26:50.803
BUT I JUST DON'T WANT YOU
TO MAKE A BIG FUSS.

26:50.840 --> 26:53.707
WE ARE NOT
GOING TO MAKE A FUSS.

26:53.740 --> 26:54.729
DETECTIVE LASSITER AND I
JUST WANT TO TH ROW YOU

26:54.780 --> 26:55.735
A GOING AWAY PARTY.

26:55.780 --> 26:57.099
IT'S GOING TO BE VERY...

26:57.140 --> 26:58.641
(newscaster)
WILLIAM WYLES III.

26:58.680 --> 26:59.999
IT WAS FORMERLY BELIEVED

27:00.050 --> 27:02.177
THAT WYLES' DEATH WAS DUE
TO AN ACCIDENTAL FALL

27:02.220 --> 27:03.949
DOWN THE STAIRS
OF HIS MONTECITO HOME.

27:03.990 --> 27:06.049
BUT NOW
A FORMER EMPLOYEE

27:06.090 --> 27:07.182
HAS COME FORWARD TO SAY...

27:07.220 --> 27:10.678
SHE HEARD LOUD ARGUING
COMING FROM THE WYLES'S STUDY

27:10.730 --> 27:11.958
THE NIGHT OF HIS DEATH.

27:11.990 --> 27:14.094
CONTRARY TO THE BELIEF
THAT WYLES WAS ALONE

27:14.130 --> 27:15.722
THE NIGHT HE DIED.

27:15.760 --> 27:17.352
SANTA BARBARA POLICE DETECTIVE
CARLTON LASSITER,

27:17.400 --> 27:19.766
WHO'S BEEN LEADING
THIS INVESTIGATION,

27:19.800 --> 27:21.267
WAS UNAVAILABLE FOR COMMENT...

27:21.300 --> 27:22.995
UNAVAILABLE FOR COMMENT?

27:23.040 --> 27:24.302
I'VE BEEN HERE ALL DAY.

27:24.340 --> 27:27.673
WHO'S NOT GIVING ME
MY MESSAGES?

27:27.710 --> 27:33.717
UH, CUPCAKES.
RIGHT, OF COURSE.

27:33.750 --> 27:35.308
WITH LITTLE CUFFS ON THEM.

27:35.350 --> 27:37.079
AND, UM, SPRINKLES.

27:37.120 --> 27:39.111
WE'RE REALLY GONNA MISS YOU.

27:39.150 --> 27:40.788
(newscaster)
WYLES, WHO BECAME
A PUBLISHING MAGNATE

27:40.820 --> 27:42.458
AT THE AGE OF 30,
WAS ONE OF SANTA BARBARA'S

27:42.490 --> 27:45.357
LEADING PHILANTHROPISTS
AND A MAJOR CONTRIBUTOR

27:45.390 --> 27:47.119
TO POLITICAL CAMPAIGNS.

27:47.160 --> 27:49.958
AS WELL AS A WELL-KNOWN
COLLECTOR OF WAR MEMORABILIA.

27:50.000 --> 27:51.922
AT HIS HEIGHT,
HE OWNED MORE THAN 30...

27:51.970 --> 27:53.267
HOW'S THE BACKGROUND CHECK
COMING?

27:53.300 --> 27:54.392
(Gus)
JUST FINISHED.

27:54.440 --> 27:57.295
RAHMENTOTTEM LIVED DURING
THE 19TH DYNASTY OF EGYPT.

27:57.340 --> 27:58.967
PROBABLY NEAR GIZA.

27:59.010 --> 28:01.137
HE HAD 11 SONS,
ALL OF WHOM SPENT

28:01.180 --> 28:02.431
THEIR DAYS SMELTING METAL

28:02.480 --> 28:03.970
FROM THE ORE
ALONG THE BANKS OF THE NILE.

28:04.010 --> 28:06.046
SMELTERS, HUH?

28:06.080 --> 28:08.139
PERHAPS YOU MISUNDERSTOOD.

28:08.180 --> 28:10.819
WE DON'T CARE WHAT HE DID
WHEN HE WAS LIVING.

28:10.850 --> 28:12.886
ONLY SINCE HE'S BEEN A MUMMY.

28:12.920 --> 28:15.115
LET'S DO THIS.

28:15.160 --> 28:16.252
FIRST, HE WAS ON DISPLAY
FOR SIX MONTHS

28:16.290 --> 28:18.019
IN CINCINNATI.

28:18.060 --> 28:19.129
HE DIDN'T KILL ANYBODY THERE.

28:19.160 --> 28:22.152
THEN HE WAS ON LOAN,
PLANO, TEXAS.

28:22.200 --> 28:25.795
NOBODY HAD THEIR EYES
OR INTERNAL ORGANS STOLEN THERE.

28:25.830 --> 28:26.797
WHAT'S THAT?

28:26.830 --> 28:27.797
IT'S A BOWL OF CHILI.

28:27.840 --> 28:28.989
AND WHO'S THAT UP THERE?

28:29.040 --> 28:31.167
IT'S AUSTIN KERNS.
WOULD YOU PAY ATTENTION?

28:31.210 --> 28:33.235
THEN HE WAS TRANSPORTED
FOR TWO DAYS BY TRUCK,

28:33.270 --> 28:35.409
SPENT THE EVENING
IN THE MUSEUM WAREHOUSE,

28:35.440 --> 28:38.170
AND BOOM, WAS ON DISPLAY
FIRST THING THE NEXT MORNING.

28:38.210 --> 28:39.848
MINE'S BETTER.

28:39.880 --> 28:41.108
YEAH, BUT MINE'S
SOMETHING SENSIBLE

28:41.150 --> 28:42.139
THAT PEOPLE MIGHT UTILIZE.

28:42.180 --> 28:44.011
OH, SO YOU'RE
THE SENSIBLE ONE NOW?

28:44.050 --> 28:45.312
MORE AND MORE LATELY.

28:45.350 --> 28:46.442
OKAY.

28:46.490 --> 28:49.152
ALL RIGHT,
LET'S WORK BACKWARDS.

28:49.190 --> 28:51.078
WE JUST DID.

28:52.490 --> 28:54.424
THIS IS AS CLOSE
AS I GET TO THAT MUSEUM.

28:54.460 --> 28:55.495
I KNOW.
QUICK, PUT THAT ON.

29:01.970 --> 29:03.130
MY NAME IS SHAWN SPENCER.

29:03.170 --> 29:05.058
I'M WORKING WITH SOPHIE
AND THE MUSEUM.

29:05.110 --> 29:07.032
THIS IS MY PARTNER
PADDY SIMCOX.

29:07.070 --> 29:08.173
WE'RE WONDERING
IF THERE'S ANY DOCUMENTATION

29:08.210 --> 29:09.336
ON THE ARRIVAL

29:09.380 --> 29:10.335
OF THE ROCK 'EM SOCK 'EM
MUMMY.

29:10.380 --> 29:11.802
RAHMENTOTTEM.

29:11.850 --> 29:13.203
OR HAS THERE BEEN
ANY INSTANCES

29:13.250 --> 29:15.070
OF THINGS EXPLODING
FOR NO APPARENT REASON?

29:15.120 --> 29:16.417
I DON'T KNOW NOTHING.

29:16.450 --> 29:18.384
AND I DON'T THINK YOU GUYS
SHOULD BE IN HERE.

29:18.420 --> 29:19.239
RIGHT.

29:19.290 --> 29:20.518
PERHAPS I'LL CALL SOPHIE
AND LET HER KNOW

29:20.550 --> 29:21.881
YOU'RE NOT BEING VERY HELPFUL.

29:21.920 --> 29:24.252
LISTEN, ALL I HAVE
SECURITY ACCESS FOR

29:24.290 --> 29:25.257
IS THIS ROOM.

29:25.290 --> 29:27.155
WELL, THEN LET US KNOW
WHAT HAPPENS HERE, MAN!

29:27.190 --> 29:28.521
HERE AT THE DOCKS!

29:28.560 --> 29:30.960
FINE, IT'S SIMPLE.

29:31.000 --> 29:32.092
THAT THING SHOWS UP,
A MUSEUM REP COMES

29:32.130 --> 29:33.324
AND DOES AN INSPECTION.

29:33.370 --> 29:36.498
AND THEN WE PUT IT
OUT ON THE FLOOR.

29:36.540 --> 29:38.838
I WISH THAT THERE WAS MORE
THAT I COULD TELL YOU...

29:38.870 --> 29:41.100
DUDE, IT'S A TRIPOD.

29:41.140 --> 29:43.233
I TOLD YOU
THAT WAS A TRIPOD.

29:43.280 --> 29:45.407
WITH A CAMERA.
COMING BACK.

29:45.450 --> 29:47.008
HEY, WAIT UP!

29:47.050 --> 29:48.074
WHOA!
WHOA WHOA WHOA!

29:49.920 --> 29:51.148
AGH!

30:00.530 --> 30:01.519
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

30:01.560 --> 30:04.324
LEFT YOUR KEYS
IN THE TRUNK LOCK.

30:04.370 --> 30:05.519
I'M SORRY.

30:05.570 --> 30:06.969
I KNOW I PROMISED
NOT TO SHOOT THERE.

30:07.000 --> 30:08.433
I KNOW YOU GUYS SAID
YOU'D CALL THE COPS,

30:08.470 --> 30:10.097
BUT I JUST NEED ONE MORE NIGHT
FOR MY PROJECT TO BE DONE.

30:10.140 --> 30:11.107
YOUR PROJECT?

30:11.140 --> 30:12.539
WELL--MY FILM PROJECT.

30:12.570 --> 30:13.559
AREN'T YOU GUYS WITH THE...

30:13.610 --> 30:15.202
YES, WE ARE.
WITH WHO?

30:15.240 --> 30:16.275
WHOEVER YOU THINK WE'RE WITH.
THE MUSEUM?

30:16.310 --> 30:16.935
YES, EXACTLY.

30:16.980 --> 30:18.447
AND YOU ARE A FILM STUDENT?

30:18.480 --> 30:21.278
YES, WORKING ON NIGHT CYCLE.

30:21.320 --> 30:22.275
IT'S MY THESIS PROJECT.

30:22.320 --> 30:23.947
IT'S JUST THE LIFE CYCLE

30:23.990 --> 30:25.548
OF A WILDFLOWER
AT THE TOP OF THE HILL.

30:25.590 --> 30:26.943
WHOA WHOA WHOA.

30:26.990 --> 30:27.957
THE NAME OF YOUR FILM
IS NIGHT CYCLE?

30:27.990 --> 30:29.014
WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT?

30:29.060 --> 30:30.948
WELL, IT'S KIND OF BORING.

30:30.990 --> 30:33.356
UNLESS IT'S ABOUT A MOTORCYCLE
THAT COMES TO LIFE AT NIGHT

30:33.390 --> 30:35.028
AND SOLVES CRIME
AND DOES SWEET WHEELIES.

30:35.060 --> 30:38.223
LISTEN, I ALREADY
TOLD THE GUY IN THE JUMPSUIT.

30:38.270 --> 30:39.567
I MEAN, YOU COULD BARELY
SEE THE MUSEUM

30:39.600 --> 30:41.033
IN THE BACKGROUND.

30:41.070 --> 30:42.230
I JUST NEEDED TO FRAME
IT UP THAT WAY.

30:42.270 --> 30:43.464
YOU HAVE FOOTAGE
OF THE MUSEUM.

30:43.500 --> 30:44.899
YEAH, BUT IT WON'T INFRINGE

30:44.940 --> 30:46.532
ON ANYONE'S COPYRIGHT,
I CAN GUARANTEE IT.

30:46.570 --> 30:48.435
DO YOU HAVE STUFF
FROM TUESDAY NIGHT?

30:48.480 --> 30:50.277
YEAH, BUT NOT ON ME.

31:09.200 --> 31:10.292
HERE IT IS.

31:10.330 --> 31:13.128
A STANDARD VIDEO CAMERA
RUNS AT 30 FRAMES PER SECOND.

31:13.170 --> 31:14.137
YEAH, WE KNOW THAT.

31:14.170 --> 31:15.239
HOW WOULD WE KNOW THAT?

31:15.270 --> 31:16.532
IT'S COMMON KNOWLEDGE, SHAWN.

31:16.570 --> 31:18.231
AND TECHNICALLY IT'S 29.97.

31:18.270 --> 31:20.067
UNLESS YOU'RE WORKING IN HD,

31:20.110 --> 31:23.034
THEN IT'S 23.98
PARTIALLY SEGMENTED FRAMES.

31:23.080 --> 31:25.548
REGARDLESS,
FOR TIME LAPSE

31:25.580 --> 31:27.047
I SET IT FOR ONE FRAME
PER MINUTE.

31:27.080 --> 31:28.172
SO EVERYTHING MOVES FASTER...

31:28.220 --> 31:29.949
30 TIMES FASTER.

31:29.980 --> 31:30.981
1,800 TIMES FASTER.

31:31.020 --> 31:32.339
I KNEW THAT.
I WAS TESTING YOU.

31:32.390 --> 31:33.345
SURE YOU DID.

31:33.390 --> 31:35.984
GUYS, WHAT ARE WE
LOOKING FOR HERE, EXACTLY?

31:36.020 --> 31:36.987
IT'S PRETTY SIMPLE.

31:37.020 --> 31:38.385
A CRIME OCCURRED
AT THE MUSEUM

31:38.430 --> 31:39.419
ON THIS PARTICULAR EVENING.

31:39.460 --> 31:40.427
WE JUST WANNA KNOW
IF YOUR CAMERA

31:40.460 --> 31:41.427
CAUGHT ANY FOOTAGE OF IT.

31:41.460 --> 31:42.597
IT'S NOTHING TOO CRAZY.

31:42.630 --> 31:44.359
AND MOST LIKELY
THERE'S A CRAZED MUMMY

31:44.400 --> 31:45.424
OUT AND ABOUT
STRANGLING PEOPLE

31:45.470 --> 31:46.425
WILLY-NILLY.

31:46.470 --> 31:47.698
YES.

31:47.730 --> 31:48.958
AND THAT.

31:49.000 --> 31:50.433
(Hannah)
THIS IS 3:00 AM.

31:50.470 --> 31:53.109
OH, SLOW IT DOWN HERE.

31:53.140 --> 31:55.199
THIS IS KIND OF EXCITING.

32:06.720 --> 32:09.518
HOLY CRAP.
GUS, CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?

32:09.560 --> 32:12.324
GUS?

32:14.430 --> 32:16.694
HE'S A LITTLE SCARED
OF MUMMIES.

32:16.730 --> 32:18.266
DUDE, IT'S JUST A FILM!

32:18.300 --> 32:19.699
VIDEO.
EVEN BETTER.

32:19.730 --> 32:22.733
NO ONE CAN REACH
THROUGH THE SCREEN AND GRAB YOU.

32:22.770 --> 32:25.637
THAT'S SO WEIRD.

32:25.670 --> 32:27.137
WE ONLY SAW HIM
FOR ONE FRAME

32:27.170 --> 32:29.274
AND THEN, YOU KNOW,
HE WALKED OUT AND POOF.

32:29.310 --> 32:30.629
HE'S GONE.

32:34.180 --> 32:38.412
WAIT.
THE LIGHTS ON THE VAN.

32:40.790 --> 32:42.417
DUDE, HE TOOK THAT VAN.

32:42.460 --> 32:43.415
THE MUMMY?

32:43.460 --> 32:44.427
GREAT.

32:44.460 --> 32:45.529
NOW WE GOT A MUMMY
ON THE LOOSE

32:45.560 --> 32:47.255
AND THE SON OF A BITCH KNOWS
HOW TO DRIVE A STICK?

32:47.290 --> 32:48.257
NOW WE KNOW
HOW HE GOT AWAY.

32:48.300 --> 32:49.255
WE NEED TO CALL THE POLICE.

32:49.300 --> 32:50.653
NO, NOT YET.
I'VE SEEN THAT VAN.

32:50.700 --> 32:52.190
YOU KNOW WHERE IT IS?

32:52.230 --> 32:54.460
UNLESS IT'S MOVED
IN THE LAST TWO HOURS, I DO.

32:56.370 --> 32:57.689
(Gus)
WHAT THE...

32:57.740 --> 33:01.130
(Shawn)
DUDE, I TOLD YOU
IT WAS HERE.

33:01.180 --> 33:03.068
[engine starting]

33:03.110 --> 33:04.509
WHOA.

33:06.610 --> 33:08.612
[tires screeching]

33:11.390 --> 33:14.359
I TOLD YOU I SAW IT!

33:16.220 --> 33:18.188
[engine starting]

33:26.500 --> 33:27.592
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

33:27.630 --> 33:28.836
(Gus)
TURNING THE CAR
AROUND, SHAWN.

33:28.870 --> 33:31.430
(Shawn)
DUDE, SHE'S NOT EVEN
GONNA BE IN CALIFORNIA

33:31.470 --> 33:32.437
BY THE TIME
WE GET OUT OF HERE.

33:32.470 --> 33:34.131
JUST KEEP TURNING THE WHEEL!

33:34.180 --> 33:35.431
(Gus)
I DON'T WANNA
HIT ANYTHING, SHAWN!

33:35.480 --> 33:36.731
THIS IS A COMPANY CAR.

33:36.780 --> 33:37.530
(Shawn)
DUDE, YOU GOT IT.

33:37.580 --> 33:40.549
YOU CLEARLY HAD IT
AFTER THE SE...

33:40.580 --> 33:42.309
REALLY?

33:42.350 --> 33:45.012
THE 11-POINT TURN, DUDE?

33:50.860 --> 33:52.521
THIS IS A PRIME EXAMPLE
OF A SITUATION

33:52.560 --> 33:54.425
BEST HANDLED BY THE POLICE.

33:54.460 --> 33:55.529
OR A WITCH DOCTOR.

33:55.560 --> 33:56.652
IT'S NOT A MUMMY, GUS.

33:56.700 --> 34:00.090
YOU KEEP SAYING THAT,
AND IT KEEPS COMING UP MUMMY.

34:00.130 --> 34:02.633
NO WAY
HE MAKES THAT TURN.

34:04.710 --> 34:06.564
WHOA.

34:06.610 --> 34:07.599
SLOW DOWN.

34:14.280 --> 34:15.440
HE HIT A TREE.

34:15.480 --> 34:16.549
LET'S GO GET HIM.

34:16.580 --> 34:17.774
I'M NOT GETTING OUT THERE.

34:17.820 --> 34:19.549
DUDE, THEY HIT A TREE.

34:19.590 --> 34:21.148
WHOEVER THEY ARE,
THEY'RE NOT MOVING.

34:21.190 --> 34:22.179
THEY'RE INCAPACITATED.

34:22.220 --> 34:23.187
THEY COULD BE HURT,

34:23.220 --> 34:24.255
MAYBE EVEN DEAD.

34:24.290 --> 34:25.325
MAYBE UNDEAD.

34:25.360 --> 34:26.384
THEY MIGHT NEED OUR HELP.

34:26.430 --> 34:28.318
OR OUR INTERNAL ORGANS!

34:28.360 --> 34:29.395
LET'S CALL THE POLICE.

34:29.430 --> 34:31.728
WITH WHOSE PHONE?

34:31.770 --> 34:32.759
ALL RIGHT, FINE.

34:32.800 --> 34:34.290
I'M BRINGING MY BAT.

34:34.340 --> 34:36.490
GRAB SOME FLASHLIGHTS.

34:46.310 --> 34:48.619
[owl hooting]

35:06.300 --> 35:13.661
SHAWN, I THINK...

35:13.710 --> 35:15.701
I THINK THIS MAY BE
THE MOST TERRIFYING MOMENT

35:15.740 --> 35:17.605
OF MY LIFE.

35:17.640 --> 35:18.777
YOU'RE CONFRONTING IT
HEAD ON.

35:18.810 --> 35:20.607
I'M SO PROUD OF YOU, BUDDY.

35:20.650 --> 35:22.379
SHH.

35:23.820 --> 35:25.913
I THINK I JUST SAW SOMEONE
RUNNING AWAY IN THE WOODS.

35:25.950 --> 35:29.408
LOOK!
THAT DOOR'S CRACKED!

35:29.460 --> 35:31.826
I DON'T THINK
ANYBODY'S HERE.

35:31.860 --> 35:33.179
HOW SURE ARE YOU?

35:33.230 --> 35:34.697
FAIRLY TO PRETTY DAMN.

35:34.730 --> 35:37.528
GOOD, BECAUSE I DON'T THINK
I CAN TAKE ONE MORE...

35:37.560 --> 35:39.790
[moaning]

35:43.500 --> 35:46.435
SHAWN?

35:52.950 --> 35:54.542
I AM TELLING YOU,
CARLYTOWN,

35:54.580 --> 35:55.717
YOU GOTTA COME WITH US
ON THIS!

35:55.750 --> 35:56.819
AND I'M TELLING YOU,
I'M ABOUT TO SOLVE

35:56.850 --> 35:57.919
THE BIGGEST CASE
OF MY CAREER.

35:57.950 --> 35:59.588
SO WHICH DO YOU THINK
I'D RATHER DO?

35:59.620 --> 36:01.952
THE OLD MAN DIDN'T DIE
FROM A FALL DOWN THE STAIRS.

36:01.990 --> 36:04.481
INITIAL FINDINGS INDICATE
HE HAD BLUNT FORCE TRAUMA

36:04.530 --> 36:05.724
TO HIS HEAD
BEFORE HE FELL.

36:05.760 --> 36:07.387
SO UNLESS YOU'VE GOT
A PSYCHIC ANSWER FOR THAT,

36:07.430 --> 36:08.920
YOU GUYS CAN RUN ALONG.

36:08.960 --> 36:10.222
AH, CRUD.

36:10.260 --> 36:11.727
NOW WYLES
ISN'T ANSWERING HIS PHONE.

36:11.770 --> 36:12.862
I HAVE THE FINAL
CORONER'S REPORT

36:12.900 --> 36:14.197
ON THAT EXHUMED BODY.

36:14.240 --> 36:15.832
IT WAS DEFINITELY
A HEAD TRAUMA.

36:15.870 --> 36:17.462
OH, AND IT TURNS OUT
THAT UNIDENTIFIED MATTER

36:17.500 --> 36:19.764
FOUND IN HIS SKULL
WAS A CHIP OF IVORY.

36:19.810 --> 36:21.334
GREAT.

36:21.380 --> 36:22.972
BUT I HAVE
THE BEST REVEAL EVER.

36:23.010 --> 36:24.238
SPENCER, WE'LL GET TO YOUR
LITTLE MUMMY THING LATER.

36:24.280 --> 36:26.305
QUITE HONESTLY,
I ONLY TOOK THE CASE

36:26.350 --> 36:28.341
BECAUSE WYLES IV IS ON
THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES.

36:28.380 --> 36:29.517
I THOUGHT
I COULD DO A LITTLE SNOOPING,

36:29.550 --> 36:32.542
BUT ALL I GOT WAS DEAD ENDS.

36:32.590 --> 36:34.854
I CAN SOLVE BOTH CASES!

36:34.890 --> 36:36.687
(Interim Chief Vick)
YOU CAN WHAT?

36:36.720 --> 36:38.551
LASSIE, CALL WYLES
ON HIS CELL PHONE.

36:38.590 --> 36:39.921
HE'LL PICK THAT UP
BECAUSE HE'S NOT AT HOME.

36:39.960 --> 36:40.858
DUDE, WE GOT IT.

36:40.890 --> 36:42.448
OH, WE ARE GOOD!

36:42.500 --> 36:43.922
THEN MEET US AT THE MUSEUM.

36:43.960 --> 36:45.894
WHY CAN'T THEY JUST MEET US
AT A WELL-LIT STARBUCKS?

36:45.930 --> 36:49.559
ONE MORE TIME, BUDDY.
FOR JUSTICE.

36:49.600 --> 36:50.669
(Wyles)
WHY AM I HERE?

36:50.700 --> 36:51.769
YOU'LL FIND OUT
SOON ENOUGH.

36:51.810 --> 36:53.801
BUT WHATEVER IT IS,
I'M TAKING FULL CREDIT FOR IT.

36:53.840 --> 36:55.979
JUST COOPERATE WITH US,
MR. WYLES.

36:56.010 --> 36:57.409
THINGS DON'T LOOK
VERY GOOD FOR YOU RIGHT NOW.

36:57.440 --> 36:58.873
YEAH, WELL,
I'LL HAVE YOUR JOB.

36:58.910 --> 37:01.617
WELL, IT'S TOO LATE FOR THAT.
SOMEONE ELSE ALREADY DOES.

37:03.950 --> 37:05.986
[moaning]

37:06.020 --> 37:08.454
SHAWN!

37:08.490 --> 37:10.981
DON'T WORRY, SOPHIE.
I'M BEING VERY GENTLE.

37:11.020 --> 37:12.829
I LAID DOWN A BLANKET
AND EVERYTHING.

37:12.860 --> 37:14.919
NOT MY FIRST TIME
ALONE IN A COFFIN.

37:14.960 --> 37:16.552
BY THE WAY...

37:16.600 --> 37:18.488
PLAYING DEAD, AWESOME.

37:19.600 --> 37:20.919
WHAT IS THIS NONSENSE?

37:20.970 --> 37:22.494
HE'S SOLVING A CASE.

37:22.540 --> 37:24.030
ACTUALLY,
I'M SOLVING TWO CASES.

37:24.070 --> 37:26.334
BUT LET'S TAKE THEM
ONE AT A TIME.

37:26.370 --> 37:30.830
FIRST, A BEING DID RISE
FROM THIS COFFIN...

37:30.880 --> 37:33.849
AND WALK OUT OF THE MUSEUM
ON TUESDAY NIGHT.

37:33.880 --> 37:36.519
STRANGLED POOR HASTINGS,
MAY HE REST IN PEACE,

37:36.550 --> 37:38.814
WITH HIS BARE HANDS.

37:38.850 --> 37:43.014
CORRECTION,
LINEN-WRAPPED HANDS.

37:43.060 --> 37:44.049
THANK YOU.

37:44.090 --> 37:46.854
I WAS THE FIRST ONE TO SAY
THAT IT WAS A MUMMY.

37:46.890 --> 37:49.950
(Shawn)
BUT THAT BEING
WAS NOT THE MUMMY...

37:50.000 --> 37:50.921
RU B-MY-BOTTOM.

37:50.960 --> 37:52.029
RAHMENTOTTEM.

37:52.070 --> 37:54.288
THAT MUMMY NEVER MADE IT
INTO THE MUSEUM.

37:54.340 --> 37:55.739
NO, THAT MUMMY NEVER MADE IT
OUT OF THE WHITE VAN

37:55.770 --> 37:56.794
IN THE PARKING LOT.

37:56.840 --> 38:00.708
IT WAS SWAPPED OUT
BY AN ANGRY WAREHOUSE FOREMAN

38:00.740 --> 38:02.332
ON WHEELS.

38:02.380 --> 38:03.870
IT WAS ALL PART
OF AN ELABORATE BREAK-IN.

38:03.910 --> 38:06.845
THIS IS ABSOLUTE INSANITY.

38:06.880 --> 38:08.643
AN INTERESTING CHOICE
OF WORDS.

38:08.680 --> 38:10.875
I THOUGHT FOR SURE
YOU'D SAY GENIUS.

38:10.920 --> 38:13.548
WELL, WHY WOULD
I SAY GENIUS?

38:13.590 --> 38:14.557
BECAUSE IT WAS YOUR PLAN.

38:14.590 --> 38:15.909
MY PLAN?

38:15.960 --> 38:18.053
YOU'RE THE ONE THAT GOT
INTO THE SNUFFALUPAGUS

38:18.090 --> 38:21.082
WRAPPED IN JUST ENOUGH
TEA-STAINED LINEN

38:21.130 --> 38:22.950
TO LOOK LIKE A MUMMY
THROUGH THE CRACKED LID.

38:23.000 --> 38:25.889
YOU NEEDED TO GET
THOSE PISTOLS BACK, DIDN'T YOU?

38:25.930 --> 38:29.036
YEAH, THE ONES THAT USED
TO BE AT THE TOP OF THE STAIRS

38:29.070 --> 38:30.139
IN YOUR FATHER'S HOUSE.

38:30.170 --> 38:34.038
ESPECIALLY THAT ONE
WITH THE CHIPPED IVORY HANDLE.

38:34.070 --> 38:35.776
WHICH...
WHICH WAS THE MURDER WEAPON!

38:35.810 --> 38:37.334
COME ON, LASS.

38:37.380 --> 38:38.870
A LITTLE CONSIDERATION,
PLEASE?

38:38.910 --> 38:39.945
I MEAN, LOOK.

38:39.980 --> 38:41.004
I'M GOING ALL OUT
WITH THE CLOTH AND THING HERE.

38:41.050 --> 38:42.017
I'M DOING MY THING.

38:42.050 --> 38:43.677
DETECT IVES. ..

38:43.720 --> 38:45.085
YOU KNOCKED YOUR FATHER
ON THE HEAD WITH THAT PISTOL,

38:45.120 --> 38:46.644
LET HIM FALL TO HIS DEATH,
AND THEN RAN OUT

38:46.690 --> 38:49.955
AND WAITED FOR SOMEBODY ELSE
TO FIND HIM.

38:49.990 --> 38:52.959
AND THE PISTOL GOT WILLED
TO THE MUSEUM.

38:52.990 --> 38:54.355
(Sophie)
THAT'S WHY YOU WORKED SO HARD

38:54.400 --> 38:55.799
TO GET
THAT EXHIBIT CLOSED.

38:55.830 --> 38:56.990
AND DELAYED THE INSTALLATION

38:57.030 --> 38:58.759
OF THE NEW SECURITY SYSTEM.

38:58.800 --> 38:59.869
WELL, HE COULDN'T GET HIS WAY
INTO THE DISPLAY.

38:59.900 --> 39:01.595
BUT HE NEEDED TO BE
IN THE MUSEUM.

39:01.640 --> 39:03.767
(Lassiter)
YOU HAVE BEEN A BUSY
LITTLE BOY, HAVEN'T YOU?

39:03.800 --> 39:05.802
(Interim Chief Vick)
I BELIEVE YOU WILL
BE MY FINAL

39:05.840 --> 39:07.831
SANTA BARBARA ARREST,
MR. WYLES.

39:07.870 --> 39:09.508
PUT YOUR HANDS
BEHIND YOUR BACK, SIR.

39:11.180 --> 39:12.147
NICE, NICE--BUT GUYS,
CHECK IT OUT.

39:12.180 --> 39:13.841
THERE'S MORE, RIGHT?

39:13.880 --> 39:15.518
HE TILTED THE CAMERA
SO THAT HE WOULDN'T BE VISIBLE.

39:15.550 --> 39:17.108
HE--

39:17.150 --> 39:21.382
HE STRANGLED HASTINGS
SO THERE WOULDN'T BE A WITNESS!

39:21.420 --> 39:23.012
I SAW HIM RUN AWAY
IN THE FOREST!

39:27.090 --> 39:30.025
GUS?

39:31.970 --> 39:35.133
IS THERE ANY CHANCE AT ALL
YOU'LL STAY?

39:35.170 --> 39:36.728
NO.

39:36.770 --> 39:38.601
BUT I'M SURE
WE'LL SEE EACH OTHER AROUND.

39:38.640 --> 39:42.508
LOOK, I KNEW THE MAYOR WANTED
RAYMOND SAUTER FOR THE JOB.

39:42.540 --> 39:43.529
HE'S AN OLD FRIEND OF HIS.

39:43.580 --> 39:45.548
BUT SAUTER
DIDN'T BECOME AVAILABLE

39:45.580 --> 39:46.740
UNTIL RECENTLY.

39:46.780 --> 39:50.079
SO I DID WHAT I HAD TO DO.

39:50.120 --> 39:52.588
LOOK, I'M SURE SAUTER
WILL DO A FINE JOB.

39:52.620 --> 39:56.158
ARE YOU SURE YOU'LL HAVE
A USE FOR THIS?

39:56.190 --> 39:58.078
DUDE, YOU'RE BEING
KIND OF INSENSITIVE.

39:58.120 --> 39:59.121
SHE'LL BE FINE.

39:59.160 --> 40:00.127
PHONE.

40:00.160 --> 40:01.957
IT'S THE MAYOR.

40:04.570 --> 40:06.060
OH.

40:07.930 --> 40:08.965
YES, SIR?

40:09.000 --> 40:11.537
WELL, YES.

40:11.570 --> 40:13.504
BUT...

40:13.540 --> 40:15.872
OF COURSE.
YES, THAT'S--

40:18.580 --> 40:19.604
SIR, YOU DON'T HAVE TO BEG.

40:21.520 --> 40:23.112
OH, YOU ARE BEGGING.

40:23.150 --> 40:25.789
AS OF NOW?

40:25.820 --> 40:29.859
OKAY.

40:33.990 --> 40:34.957
I'M THE NEW CHIEF.

40:35.000 --> 40:35.955
[gasp5]

40:36.000 --> 40:37.058
NOT INTERIM?

40:37.100 --> 40:38.226
DON'T YOU DARE
CALL ME THAT AGAIN.

40:38.260 --> 40:43.835
[all cheering]

40:43.870 --> 40:45.235
(Julie)
OH, MY GOD, WHAT HAPPENED?
WHAT DID HE SAY?

40:45.270 --> 40:46.806
I HONESTLY HAVE NO IDEA.

40:46.840 --> 40:47.966
I THINK I DO.

40:49.640 --> 40:51.073
WHAT'S THIS?

40:51.110 --> 40:52.839
(Lassiter)
BUMPED MY ARREST
TO PAGE TWO.

40:56.150 --> 40:57.674
CONGRATULATIONS, KAREN.

40:57.720 --> 40:58.744
THANK YOU.

40:58.790 --> 40:59.779
[whistling]

41:04.530 --> 41:05.588
WE SHOULD HAVE A PARTY!

41:05.630 --> 41:07.222
(Gus)
WE SHOULD DEFINITELY
HAVE A PARTY.

41:07.260 --> 41:08.591
(Julie)
WE HAVE ALL
THE PARTY ACCOUTREMENTS!

41:08.630 --> 41:10.598
OH, JUST GO GET
SOME PARTY GEAR

41:10.630 --> 41:13.724
AND JUST OPEN SOME CRACKERS
AND A BOTTLE OF SOMETHING.

41:16.140 --> 41:17.994
SHAWN, ARE YOU SURE
YOU DIDN'T GET

41:18.040 --> 41:20.008
SOME SORT OF SPECIAL MESSAGE
THIS WEEK?

41:20.040 --> 41:23.134
DAD, I TOLD YOU,
I DROPPED MY PHONE.

41:23.180 --> 41:24.943
NOW, I GOTTA GO.
NO NO, SHAWN!

41:24.980 --> 41:25.947
LOOK, THERE'S SOMETHING
I GOTTA GET OFF MY CHEST

41:25.980 --> 41:27.277
BEFORE YOU LEAVE HERE!

41:27.310 --> 41:28.402
DAD, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU
JUST READ THE SECRET,

41:28.450 --> 41:30.668
OR WATCHED
AN EMOTIONAL OPRAH OR WHAT.

41:30.720 --> 41:31.846
BUT I DON'T THINK WE'RE READY
TO OPEN OUR SOULS

41:31.890 --> 41:32.845
TO EACH OTHER.

41:32.890 --> 41:34.118
WELL, WE HAVE
NO CHOICE, KID.

41:34.150 --> 41:35.651
BUT WE DO,
AND IT'S GOOD.

41:35.690 --> 41:37.214
BECAUSE WHAT WE HAVE
IS SIMPLE AND SHALLOW

41:37.260 --> 41:38.249
AND UNOBTRUSIVE.

41:38.290 --> 41:39.882
SO LET'S HAVE
THIS CONVERSATION

41:39.930 --> 41:42.524
WHEN YOU'RE 90 AND MAYBE
ON AN OXYGEN TANK.

41:42.560 --> 41:43.595
'CAUSE I HAVE A DATE
WITH A WOMAN

41:43.630 --> 41:44.597
WHO RUNS A MUSEUM.
[doorbell rings]

41:44.630 --> 41:45.665
AND THAT'S NEW FOR ME.

41:45.700 --> 41:47.565
NO, SHAWN!
PLEASE, NO!

41:47.600 --> 41:48.692
IT JUST FEELS GOOD.

41:48.740 --> 41:50.537
YOU KNOW WHAT,
I'LL GRAB THE DOOR FOR YOU

41:50.570 --> 41:52.128
ON MY WAY OUT!

41:55.610 --> 41:58.545
MOM.
