WEBVTT

00:03.271 --> 00:04.971
Notice how whenever I come
around, there's always sparks?

00:04.971 --> 00:08.642
Judson, there's no need in
hiding our relationship anymore.

00:10.478 --> 00:11.879
This needs to stop.
I can't handle it.

00:11.879 --> 00:14.415
I'm trying to move on,
and you won't let me.

00:14.415 --> 00:16.417
I was trying to get over someone
and I shouldn't have dated,

00:16.417 --> 00:18.086
but I wanted to
because I liked you.

00:18.086 --> 00:19.853
GEORGE:
 This craziness

00:19.853 --> 00:22.490
ends now 'cause you have
been acting insane for weeks.

00:22.490 --> 00:24.058
There's only so much I am
willing to put up with, Lemon.

00:24.058 --> 00:25.826
She is your mother,
but she was my wife.

00:25.826 --> 00:27.828
LEMON: She's not coming back.
BRICK: You don't know that.

00:27.828 --> 00:28.896
LEMON:
 Yes, I do.

00:28.896 --> 00:31.699
* *

00:31.699 --> 00:37.638
This is Dash DeWitt
 for BlueBell's own gossip site.

00:37.638 --> 00:41.675
Y'all, it is one day before
the town's most romantic event,

00:41.675 --> 00:43.744
the Sweetie Pie Dance,

00:43.744 --> 00:46.747
a time when couples take
things to the next level,

00:46.747 --> 00:51.085
or don't, a time when you ask
someone to be your sweetie pie.

00:51.085 --> 00:52.453
(grumbles)

00:52.453 --> 00:54.122
Or you shove a pie
in their kisser.

00:54.122 --> 00:55.256
(chuckles)
Mayor Hayes.

00:55.256 --> 00:57.091
Yeah.
The people
want to know,

00:57.091 --> 00:58.959
is Didi Ruano gonna be
your sweetie pie?

00:58.959 --> 01:00.060
Oh, ooh.

01:00.060 --> 01:02.763
(laughing):
The mayor has comment.

01:02.763 --> 01:04.798
But Lavon Hayes sure hopes so.

01:04.798 --> 01:06.800
(laughs)
And, Zoe Hart,

01:06.800 --> 01:09.870
will you be going
with the handsome veterinarian,

01:09.870 --> 01:12.072
Dr. Judson Lyons?

01:12.072 --> 01:14.208
The Blawker
reports you two

01:14.208 --> 01:16.444
have been hot and heavy
for the past few weeks.

01:16.444 --> 01:17.378
Dash,

01:17.378 --> 01:19.012
I really do not want
to be recorded.

01:19.012 --> 01:22.015
Attention Blawkerites,
Zudson is over.

01:22.015 --> 01:23.884
I told you.
What?

01:23.884 --> 01:25.253
We are not over.

01:25.253 --> 01:26.887
Okay, we are not anything.

01:26.887 --> 01:28.189
We've been on three dates.

01:28.189 --> 01:30.057
Three really,
really good dates.

01:30.057 --> 01:31.425
But, still...

01:31.425 --> 01:33.327
So, are you ready to take things
to the next level?

01:33.327 --> 01:34.695
You know, if you go

01:34.695 --> 01:36.497
with him to the dance,
you'll be declaring him

01:36.497 --> 01:39.400
to be your sweetie pie
in front of the whole town.

01:39.400 --> 01:44.172
And nothing says serious
like a small town slow dance

01:44.172 --> 01:45.739
under twinkle lights.

01:45.739 --> 01:46.907
He hasn't asked me.

01:46.907 --> 01:49.843
Oh, well, my nose for news
says he's about to.

01:49.843 --> 01:51.078
No, he isn't. Is he?

01:51.078 --> 01:52.180
(clears throat)

01:52.180 --> 01:53.247
LAVON:
Good luck with that, Big Z.

01:53.247 --> 01:56.284
Keep me posted.

01:56.284 --> 01:57.651
(hands slap)
Mayor.

01:57.651 --> 01:58.852
LAVON:
Yeah.

01:58.852 --> 02:00.321
Dash.
Hi.

02:00.321 --> 02:02.490
They kiss, Blawkerites.
No tongue.

02:02.490 --> 02:03.191
(chuckles)

02:03.191 --> 02:04.225
It's good to see you.

02:04.225 --> 02:05.526
Me, too.
I mean, you, too.

02:05.526 --> 02:07.127
Sorry, I never know the
right answer to that.

02:07.127 --> 02:11.432
So, I don't know if all the
decorations have given it away,

02:11.432 --> 02:14.335
but tomorrow's the big
Sweetie Pie Dance, and...

02:14.335 --> 02:16.036
I don't want to go!

02:16.036 --> 02:17.871
O... kay.

02:17.871 --> 02:19.940
I mean, it's not that
I don't like you.

02:19.940 --> 02:21.342
Because I do!

02:21.342 --> 02:23.411
See, I've only been in
one real relationship,

02:23.411 --> 02:24.712
and I basically ruined it.

02:24.712 --> 02:26.880
And, apparently, this
dance is a big deal.

02:26.880 --> 02:30.184
I don't want to mess everything
up by moving too fast.

02:30.184 --> 02:31.585
I mean, if that's okay.

02:31.585 --> 02:33.954
You know what, you're right.
Why add pressure?

02:33.954 --> 02:35.489
So, Zoe Hart,

02:35.489 --> 02:38.559
would you not go to the
Sweetie Pie Dance with me?

02:38.559 --> 02:41.094
I'd love to! I mean,
I would love not to.

02:41.094 --> 02:43.197
(laughing)
You know what I mean.

02:43.197 --> 02:44.898
(phone rings)
Oh, shoot.

02:44.898 --> 02:46.467
You know what,
I have to go.

02:46.467 --> 02:47.768
Will you call me later?

02:47.768 --> 02:49.503
Absolutely.

02:52.573 --> 02:53.974
Hi.

02:53.974 --> 02:55.643
Hey, Rose, you sick?

02:55.643 --> 02:57.778
Uh, no, I just came to visit.

02:57.778 --> 03:00.248
So...

03:00.248 --> 03:02.216
The dance? Judson?

03:02.216 --> 03:03.584
Yes or no?

03:03.584 --> 03:04.385
No.

03:04.385 --> 03:05.686
But I'm happy about it.

03:05.686 --> 03:06.654
Then, question.

03:06.654 --> 03:08.256
My parents are
going camping tomorrow,

03:08.256 --> 03:10.090
and, OMG, it is so boring.

03:10.090 --> 03:12.360
All they do is fish
and then eat fish,

03:12.360 --> 03:14.262
but I'm not allowed
to stay alone.

03:14.262 --> 03:15.963
So, can I stay with you?

03:15.963 --> 03:17.365
Yeah, that sounds really fun.

03:17.365 --> 03:18.799
It's a date.
Yay!

03:18.799 --> 03:21.001
We can have a Sex and the City
movie marathon.

03:21.001 --> 03:22.970
Yes.

03:24.104 --> 03:25.806
GEORGE:
 Missed you at breakfast.

03:25.806 --> 03:28.509
Honey, I'm sorry,
I had to get up at 5:00 a.m.

03:28.509 --> 03:30.244
to finish our Save
the Date cards, and,

03:30.244 --> 03:31.812
I finally have!

03:31.812 --> 03:34.214
I didn't know you'd be
calligraphying them yourself.

03:34.214 --> 03:35.516
Honey, these
envelopes will give

03:35.516 --> 03:37.017
the first impressions
of our wedding.

03:37.017 --> 03:38.151
They have to be perfect.

03:38.151 --> 03:41.021
(sighs)
But I am fatigued.

03:41.021 --> 03:42.790
Between the Belle
food drive,

03:42.790 --> 03:45.726
and the Preservation Society
library restoration project,

03:45.726 --> 03:48.529
and putting up all those
paper hearts in town square,

03:48.529 --> 03:50.964
it's just really
taken its toll.

03:50.964 --> 03:53.301
Yeah, I know.

03:53.301 --> 03:55.569
I feel like I haven't
seen you in weeks.

03:55.569 --> 03:57.771
And before that
we were, um...

03:57.771 --> 03:59.039
fighting.

03:59.039 --> 04:00.708
(exhales)
I feel like

04:00.708 --> 04:02.576
we haven't really been us
since before Christmas.

04:02.576 --> 04:06.179
Oh, don't be so
hyperbolic, darling.

04:06.179 --> 04:08.816
Hey, what you and I need

04:08.816 --> 04:12.320
is some good
old-fashioned romance.

04:12.320 --> 04:13.821
Which is why
it is perfect timing

04:13.821 --> 04:15.556
that tomorrow
is the Sweetie Pie Dance.

04:15.556 --> 04:16.457
Hmm.

04:16.457 --> 04:19.293
Remember the first
one we went to?

04:19.293 --> 04:20.861
I was extremely nervous,

04:20.861 --> 04:22.330
and your dad was not
helping the situation

04:22.330 --> 04:23.631
'cause he kept on
coming over and going,

04:23.631 --> 04:25.599
"Do not dance too close."

04:25.599 --> 04:26.867
(laughs)
And we broke
into the high school

04:26.867 --> 04:29.670
and went into the swimming pool.
Yeah.

04:29.670 --> 04:31.672
We made some great memories
at those dances, huh?

04:31.672 --> 04:33.073
Mmm.

04:33.073 --> 04:34.608
Correct me if I'm wrong,

04:34.608 --> 04:37.545
but Magnolia's at school, huh?

04:37.545 --> 04:41.148
Maybe we could
create some more?

04:41.148 --> 04:43.016
Honey, I would love to,

04:43.016 --> 04:45.319
but I promised Daddy
that he could take me shopping

04:45.319 --> 04:46.487
for a dress for the dance.

04:46.487 --> 04:49.289
Okay? But tomorrow
I'm all yours.

04:49.289 --> 04:50.758
Will you do me a favor?

04:50.758 --> 04:53.461
Can you put these in the mailbox
when you get into town?

04:53.461 --> 04:55.429
Uh, yep.
Okay.

04:55.429 --> 04:56.964
It's the least
I can do.

04:56.964 --> 04:57.831
Thank you.

04:57.831 --> 05:00.200
They are beautiful,
by the way.

05:00.200 --> 05:02.403
I'll see you tomorrow.

05:06.039 --> 05:08.976
Lavon, what on earth are you
bringing me a pie for?

05:08.976 --> 05:10.177
It's 10:00 a.m.

05:10.177 --> 05:11.779
It's Agnes' specialty.

05:11.779 --> 05:13.447
Banana cream.

05:13.447 --> 05:16.083
Will you please
just have one piece?

05:16.083 --> 05:18.586
(sighs)

05:19.587 --> 05:21.355
There's paper in it!

05:21.355 --> 05:22.623
Yeah.
That's not very hygienic.

05:22.623 --> 05:24.792
George should take this
to the health board.

05:24.792 --> 05:27.127
Didi, I think that paper
might be a note.

05:27.127 --> 05:28.662
Why don't you read it?

05:36.837 --> 05:37.971
"Will you be

05:37.971 --> 05:38.939
mmmmmm

05:38.939 --> 05:39.973
swmmmm?"

05:39.973 --> 05:41.174
No.

05:41.174 --> 05:44.144
It's supposed to say,
"Will you be my sweetie?"

05:44.144 --> 05:45.913
Weird.

05:45.913 --> 05:47.948
Agnes is asking me
to be her sweetie?
No.

05:47.948 --> 05:50.618
Lavon Hayes is asking you
to the Sweetie Pie Dance.

05:50.618 --> 05:52.853
But how am I gonna break
the news to Agnes?

05:53.421 --> 05:55.723
I'm kidding.

05:56.757 --> 05:58.626
Girl.

06:00.561 --> 06:03.296
We'll have a good ol' time.

06:03.296 --> 06:04.832
LEMON:
 Addy!

06:04.832 --> 06:06.567
Look at the dress
that Daddy got me.

06:06.567 --> 06:09.369
Oh, I just love BlueBell
this time of year.

06:09.369 --> 06:11.839
You can feel the
romance, can't you?
Oh, and Bill and I need it.

06:11.839 --> 06:14.341
Those boys of mine have
been sucking the sexy

06:14.341 --> 06:16.710
right out of our marriage.

06:16.710 --> 06:19.847
Ooh, now, listen after our
kids were born, Alice and I

06:19.847 --> 06:21.314
would spend a night
at the bed-and-breakfast

06:21.314 --> 06:23.016
after the dance.

06:23.016 --> 06:24.718
(gasps)
Daddy!
Well, sorry, honey.

06:24.718 --> 06:26.219
I would buy her a corsage,

06:26.219 --> 06:28.922
and then I'd pick her up
like we were still courting.

06:28.922 --> 06:32.726
We would walk to the dance,
under the stars, holding hands,

06:32.726 --> 06:34.662
like we were teenagers.
You think about it.

06:34.662 --> 06:37.998
Daddy, don't you
think that it's time

06:37.998 --> 06:40.734
that you create some new
Sweetie Pie memories?

06:40.734 --> 06:42.570
Oh, Brick, I can't
help but agree.

06:42.570 --> 06:44.104
The dance isn't till tomorrow.

06:44.104 --> 06:46.073
There's plenty of time
for you to ask someone.

06:46.073 --> 06:47.007
Oh, you two...

06:47.007 --> 06:49.109
Who would I take
even if I wanted to?

06:50.911 --> 06:53.847
(slams hand on counter)
Addy, I'm on it.

07:00.688 --> 07:02.055
Hey!

07:02.055 --> 07:03.123
Addy!

07:03.123 --> 07:04.157
Thank goodness.

07:04.157 --> 07:05.826
(chuckles)
I need a woman's eye, okay?

07:05.826 --> 07:09.296
should I get Didi
this corsage for the dance?

07:09.296 --> 07:12.600
Well, is this the Didi that
works at the law office

07:12.600 --> 07:14.234
or some other Didi
in middle school?

07:14.234 --> 07:16.336
'Cause... Oh, here.

07:16.336 --> 07:18.371
Nothing says, "Be mine"

07:18.371 --> 07:19.507
like red roses.

07:19.507 --> 07:21.074
Simple, direct,
to the point.

07:21.074 --> 07:21.975
Can't miss.

07:21.975 --> 07:23.577
Thanks, Addy.
You're the best.

07:23.577 --> 07:25.212
All right.

07:25.212 --> 07:26.980
DIDI:
Oh, Al, be serious.

07:26.980 --> 07:30.584
And nothing says I don't
want to be yours like that.

07:30.584 --> 07:31.919
(Didi laughs)

07:40.093 --> 07:42.262
Ew!

07:42.262 --> 07:44.665
Joelle and I, we were, uh,

07:44.665 --> 07:46.667
just playing a little game
of strip eight ball.

07:46.667 --> 07:48.802
That sounds fun; hey, Joelle,
you can count to eight?

07:48.802 --> 07:50.270
I can count to one.
Oh...

07:50.270 --> 07:53.240
Baby, why don't you
go wait for me at the house.

07:53.240 --> 07:54.675
Yeah, why don't you?

07:54.675 --> 07:56.343
(clears throat)

07:56.343 --> 08:00.514
So, hear you and,
uh, Dr. Dolittle

08:00.514 --> 08:01.815
aren't going to the dance.

08:01.815 --> 08:03.216
Everyone was wondering

08:03.216 --> 08:04.918
how long it would take
for you to blow it.
Look,

08:04.918 --> 08:08.021
just because I don't feel
like declaring Judson my...

08:08.021 --> 08:09.389
sweetie pie,

08:09.389 --> 08:10.658
doesn't mean I
don't like him.

08:10.658 --> 08:12.560
It just means that
I'm a grown-ass woman

08:12.560 --> 08:14.461
whose love life doesn't
need to be dictated

08:14.461 --> 08:15.696
by this town's
crazy calendar.

08:15.696 --> 08:17.097
You did stand him up once.

08:17.097 --> 08:19.166
And, honestly,

08:19.166 --> 08:20.433
I can't blame you.

08:20.433 --> 08:21.702
I mean, the most
exciting thing

08:21.702 --> 08:23.804
that guy's ever done was...

08:23.804 --> 08:26.439
oh, yeah, nailing your
best friend at Homecoming.

08:26.439 --> 08:28.576
Zoe, the guy is

08:28.576 --> 08:29.943
Boresville, USA.

08:29.943 --> 08:32.245
Judson is not a bore, okay?

08:32.245 --> 08:33.714
He's just soft spoken.

08:33.714 --> 08:35.982
Like Sam Shepard
in Baby Boom,

08:35.982 --> 08:37.951
which is one of
my favorite movies.

08:37.951 --> 08:40.953
About a city girl who falls
for a handsome, kind town vet.

08:42.022 --> 08:43.624
Judson is awesome.

08:43.624 --> 08:45.793
Yeah, you know what,
I would be a fool

08:45.793 --> 08:47.895
to not want to take things
to the next level.

08:47.895 --> 08:50.831
Wade, you are so
right. Thank you.

08:51.665 --> 08:54.334
(dialing phone)
Hey, Judson.

08:54.334 --> 08:55.535
It's Zoe.

08:55.535 --> 08:58.005
Look, I made
a mistake before.

08:58.005 --> 09:01.742
I know I don't have a lot
of relationship experience,

09:01.742 --> 09:05.012
but will you be my...

09:05.012 --> 09:08.682
Will you go with me
to that dance tomorrow?

09:08.682 --> 09:10.483
Excellent.

09:10.483 --> 09:12.319
I can't wait.

09:12.319 --> 09:14.321
Bye.

09:14.321 --> 09:17.324
(snores loudly)

09:17.324 --> 09:19.326
Boresville!

09:41.248 --> 09:43.016
You look like crap.

09:45.518 --> 09:46.854
Couldn't sleep last night.

09:46.854 --> 09:48.656
Saw something that upset me.

09:48.656 --> 09:49.857
Was it Wade and Joelle

09:49.857 --> 09:51.625
making out on his porch again?

09:51.625 --> 09:53.994
The woman kisses like
she's eating corn.

09:53.994 --> 09:55.629
Wasn't Wade and Joelle.

09:55.629 --> 09:58.098
Do you want to talk about it?

09:58.098 --> 09:59.599
No.
Okay.

09:59.599 --> 10:01.501
But, Lavon,
I'm a great listener.

10:01.501 --> 10:03.370
Kind, considerate.

10:03.370 --> 10:05.172
I'm here for you.

10:06.506 --> 10:07.641
Just as soon

10:07.641 --> 10:09.643
as I mend
a 14-year-old's heart.

10:13.580 --> 10:15.315
Hey, did you get my messages?

10:15.315 --> 10:18.185
I'm so, so sorry for
cancelling our sleepover.

10:18.185 --> 10:19.386
I promise you

10:19.386 --> 10:21.621
the biggest stack of pancakes
to make up for it.

10:21.621 --> 10:22.923
Zoe, it is so no big deal.

10:22.923 --> 10:24.157
I'm gonna stay
at Courtney Ann's.

10:24.157 --> 10:25.693
I already cleared
it with my parents.

10:25.693 --> 10:27.127
Really?

10:27.127 --> 10:28.729
Well, if you're upset,
I promise I'll cancel.

10:28.729 --> 10:30.163
Good thing I'm
not upset then.

10:30.163 --> 10:31.031
I am thrilled.

10:31.031 --> 10:32.632
You're going to the dance,

10:32.632 --> 10:33.901
and Judson is so cute.

10:33.901 --> 10:35.335
He is, right?
Mm-hmm.

10:35.335 --> 10:37.938
He reminds me of, like,
a mute Rob Lowe.

10:37.938 --> 10:40.207
Rose!
No, I know he talks.

10:40.207 --> 10:41.809
Right? He does talk?

10:41.809 --> 10:42.943
Yes. Yes. He talks.

10:42.943 --> 10:44.878
He's a man of few words,

10:44.878 --> 10:47.580
but the words he speaks
are eloquent and sensitive.

10:47.580 --> 10:49.049
He's great,
and I asked Addy

10:49.049 --> 10:52.452
to cancel my only patient today,
so I could spend the day

10:52.452 --> 10:54.554
trying to relax and get myself
in a romantic mood.

10:54.554 --> 10:56.489
It takes you
a whole day?

10:56.489 --> 10:58.358
I'm a tense person, okay?

10:58.358 --> 11:01.228
If I was in New York,
I would get a blowout

11:01.228 --> 11:03.296
at Sally Hershberger's
or a facial at Bliss.

11:03.296 --> 11:06.166
But in BlueBell,
I do the best I can.

11:06.166 --> 11:07.300
Take a bubble bath

11:07.300 --> 11:09.502
while I spray my arms
with bug repellent.

11:09.502 --> 11:11.171
I need my ritual

11:11.171 --> 11:12.740
in order to get
out of my head.

11:12.740 --> 11:14.474
Okay, thank you
for understanding.

11:14.474 --> 11:15.843
I'll see you later.

11:15.843 --> 11:17.711
Bye.
Bye.

11:17.711 --> 11:19.713
You're just one wound-up
little corkscrew, aren't you?

11:19.713 --> 11:21.114
Go away.

11:21.949 --> 11:24.184
Whatcha looking at, four eyes?

11:24.184 --> 11:26.319
Go away.

11:26.319 --> 11:28.521
LEMON: Oh, honey,
 I can't wait till 8:00.

11:28.521 --> 11:30.623
You are just gonna love
my dress.

11:30.623 --> 11:32.092
(knocking)
Oh, hold on.

11:32.092 --> 11:33.794
AGNES: I'm sorry I'm late
with my weekly order.

11:33.794 --> 11:37.130
I know that Brick likes
to taste his pie before
he goes to work,

11:37.130 --> 11:38.799
but I've been baking
round the clock

11:38.799 --> 11:42.069
trying to get 50
ready for the dance.

11:42.069 --> 11:44.704
Agnes, who are
you going with?

11:44.704 --> 11:46.139
(laughs)
Don't be silly.

11:46.139 --> 11:48.108
As soon as I deliver
my pies, I'm gonna

11:48.108 --> 11:49.709
put on my slippers
and watch whatever

11:49.709 --> 11:51.144
dance competition's
on the TV.

11:51.144 --> 11:53.513
Why don't you put
that in the kitchen,

11:53.513 --> 11:54.681
and then we'll have some tea.

11:54.681 --> 11:56.716
All right.

11:56.716 --> 11:58.819
(laughs)
Honey,

11:58.819 --> 12:00.020
better take those legal briefs

12:00.020 --> 12:01.688
out of your backseat,
because tonight

12:01.688 --> 12:03.623
we are double-dating
with Agnes and Daddy.

12:03.623 --> 12:05.025
No, Lemon,
that is a horrible idea.

12:05.025 --> 12:07.160
And besides, tonight's
supposed to be about us.

12:07.160 --> 12:08.896
Oh, honey, come on,
nothing is more romantic

12:08.896 --> 12:10.330
than infecting others
with the fever.

12:10.330 --> 12:11.364
Lemon...
Love you.

12:11.364 --> 12:12.766
(beep)
(sighs)

12:12.766 --> 12:14.501
Lemon?

12:16.469 --> 12:17.737
(phone rings)

12:17.737 --> 12:19.139
Zoe, is something wrong?

12:19.139 --> 12:21.775
No. I just wanted
to let you know how much

12:21.775 --> 12:23.777
I'm looking forward to tonight.

12:23.777 --> 12:26.046
As a matter of fact,
I was thinking

12:26.046 --> 12:28.315
maybe after the dance
you could stay over?

12:28.315 --> 12:31.584
Really? That's a...
very intriguing invitation.

12:31.584 --> 12:34.154
Good. Because I'm already
getting in the mood.

12:34.154 --> 12:36.156
I'm about to take a bubble bath

12:36.156 --> 12:39.226
with some products my mother
sent me from Frederic Fekkai.

12:39.226 --> 12:42.429
Oh, they smell like guava
in a bottle.

12:43.530 --> 12:44.932
Where'd they go?

12:44.932 --> 12:46.599
Wh... I left them right here.

12:46.599 --> 12:48.435
How could I
have lost my shampoo?

12:48.435 --> 12:49.602
It happens, I suppose.

12:49.602 --> 12:51.805
Look, I got a goat with
laryngitis waiting on me,

12:51.805 --> 12:53.941
so, um, how about
I pick you up at 8:00?

12:53.941 --> 12:55.475
'Kay. Bye.

12:55.475 --> 12:56.844
(groans)

12:58.645 --> 13:02.515
Looks like we got more than
a dance to get ready for.

13:03.550 --> 13:06.653
(man whistling a tune)

13:06.653 --> 13:08.655
(stops whistling)

13:08.655 --> 13:10.090
What are you doing?
Recon.

13:10.090 --> 13:11.959
Saw that guy with
Didi last night.

13:11.959 --> 13:13.093
Didi was out with another guy?

13:13.093 --> 13:14.928
Thought you asked her

13:14.928 --> 13:16.629
to the Sweetie Pie Dance.

13:16.629 --> 13:18.631
I did. She said yes.

13:18.631 --> 13:21.134
I thought she understood
the significance of that.

13:21.134 --> 13:22.502
Well, maybe that guy's

13:22.502 --> 13:25.238
just her accountant.
She met with
her accountant

13:25.238 --> 13:28.041
at 9:00 p.m. on a
bench in town square?

13:28.041 --> 13:30.310
Her brother, then. He...

13:30.310 --> 13:32.345
he... kind of
looks like her.

13:32.345 --> 13:33.513
He has red hair.

13:33.513 --> 13:35.082
He could be adopted.
Look, the point is,

13:35.082 --> 13:36.316
Didi's bonkers for you.

13:36.316 --> 13:38.852
And need I remind you,
you are Lavon Hayes,

13:38.852 --> 13:40.988
football star, mayor.

13:40.988 --> 13:42.822
Oh, wait-- you're
absolutely right.

13:42.822 --> 13:43.857
I'm Lavon Hayes.

13:43.857 --> 13:45.158
(chuckles)

13:45.158 --> 13:46.793
I don't what I'm
freaking out about.

13:46.793 --> 13:47.995
Oh, now.

13:47.995 --> 13:49.829
Yeah. He probably
 is her brother.

13:49.829 --> 13:50.597
Yeah.

13:50.597 --> 13:51.731
All right.

13:51.731 --> 13:53.333
All right, buddy.

13:53.333 --> 13:54.601
Watch out.

13:54.601 --> 13:56.069
(chuckles)

13:57.470 --> 13:58.939
(sighs)

13:59.739 --> 14:00.974
Hi.

14:00.974 --> 14:02.309
I just wanted

14:02.309 --> 14:04.611
to introduce myself--
I'm Mayor Hayes. Yeah.

14:04.611 --> 14:06.379
Al O'Grady.

14:06.379 --> 14:08.081
O-O'Grady.

14:08.081 --> 14:09.549
Good, yeah. Uh...

14:09.549 --> 14:10.817
So, O'Grady,

14:10.817 --> 14:13.887
what-what brings you
to our town?
I came for my woman.

14:13.887 --> 14:15.956
Uh-huh.
Didi Ruano.

14:18.325 --> 14:20.560
I see.

14:22.162 --> 14:23.496
(Lavon clears throat)

14:23.496 --> 14:25.532
LEMON:
 Hi, Daddy.

14:25.532 --> 14:28.535
BRICK: Hey.
Agnes and I just
stopped by to say hello.

14:28.535 --> 14:30.837
Well, this is a surprise.

14:30.837 --> 14:31.771
(giggles)

14:31.771 --> 14:32.940
Nice to see you, too, Agnes.

14:32.940 --> 14:34.474
Nice to see you.

14:34.474 --> 14:37.044
Hey, how's the pie business?
Uh... W-W...

14:37.044 --> 14:38.678
I'm making a lot of
huckleberry this month.

14:38.678 --> 14:39.846
BRICK:
Oh, I just love me

14:39.846 --> 14:41.381
some huckleberry pie.

14:41.381 --> 14:43.650
(Agnes gasps)
I used to pick huckleberries
with my mama.

14:43.650 --> 14:44.884
(laughs)

14:44.884 --> 14:47.187
No way!
Oh, my goodness!

14:47.187 --> 14:49.489
Look at you two!
So much in common.

14:49.489 --> 14:50.890
And speaking of pies,

14:50.890 --> 14:54.461
tonight is the Sweetie
Pie Dance, right?
BRICK: Yeah. Right.

14:54.461 --> 14:55.728
Right.
And I bet

14:55.728 --> 14:59.399
no one is in more demand than
the pie lady herself, huh?

14:59.399 --> 15:00.467
Well, sure.

15:00.467 --> 15:02.902
But oddly, she's
alone tonight, Daddy.

15:02.902 --> 15:04.737
Isn't that such a shame?

15:04.737 --> 15:06.106
Oh, that's a shame.

15:06.106 --> 15:08.441
We'll have to do something
about that, right?

15:08.441 --> 15:09.709
(laughs)
Okay.

15:09.709 --> 15:10.777
Okay!

15:10.777 --> 15:12.645
We'll see you later, then.

15:14.347 --> 15:16.816
DIDI:
 How was Mobile?

15:16.816 --> 15:18.952
Useless.

15:18.952 --> 15:20.887
Corrine Terwilliger insisted

15:20.887 --> 15:24.424
on trying to get
her bull registered
as a sex offender.

15:24.424 --> 15:26.093
Again. (chuckles)

15:26.093 --> 15:28.328
The Todd briefs are proofed
and ready to go.

15:28.328 --> 15:30.230
The D.A. returned
the Benson file.

15:30.230 --> 15:32.265
Oh, and Lemon called,
said she forgot to add

15:32.265 --> 15:34.467
her second cousin Louise
to the Save the Date cards.

15:34.467 --> 15:37.070
The Save the Date cards!
I'm sure Louise
won't be angry

15:37.070 --> 15:38.371
if you mail
her one today.

15:38.371 --> 15:40.107
No, no,
that's not it, Didi.

15:40.107 --> 15:42.475
I was supposed to mail
them yesterday, and I...

15:42.475 --> 15:44.177
I can't remember if I did it.

15:44.177 --> 15:46.213
Sometimes when I'm in the
shower I can't remember

15:46.213 --> 15:47.847
whether or not
I washed my hair.

15:47.847 --> 15:50.517
So I have to
do it again.

15:50.517 --> 15:52.119
But yes, we should
figure this out.

15:52.119 --> 15:53.720
Where's the last
place you saw them?

15:54.754 --> 15:56.323
(drops case)
I have no idea.

15:56.323 --> 15:57.724
So maybe you mailed them.

16:00.693 --> 16:02.929
Let's hope so, Didi.

16:02.929 --> 16:05.432
Let's hope so.

16:05.432 --> 16:08.168
(slow inhale)

16:08.168 --> 16:10.437
(slow exhale)

16:12.139 --> 16:15.175
(radio playing
mid-tempo country song)

16:19.079 --> 16:21.048
(turns off radio)

16:21.048 --> 16:23.383
(sighs):
Mmm...

16:24.517 --> 16:25.652
Relax.

16:25.652 --> 16:27.854
(low grunting nearby)
(whispers):
Relax.

16:27.854 --> 16:30.323
(low grunting continues)

16:35.895 --> 16:38.465
(gasps, screams)

16:38.465 --> 16:39.832
Wade! Wade!

16:39.832 --> 16:43.136
Wade! You got to get
this possum out of my house!

16:43.136 --> 16:46.073
Wade! I hear you
in there!

16:46.073 --> 16:47.774
Wade's not here.

16:47.774 --> 16:49.042
W...

16:49.042 --> 16:50.177
(sniffs)

16:50.177 --> 16:53.180
What... what's that I smell?

16:53.680 --> 16:55.448
Is that guava?

16:55.448 --> 16:57.384
Not that it's your business...

16:57.384 --> 16:59.519
but Wade got me
this new shampoo.

17:00.653 --> 17:01.254
Bye.

17:01.788 --> 17:02.755
What?!

17:02.755 --> 17:04.656
Wade!

17:07.160 --> 17:08.428
(music stations
on radio changing)

17:08.428 --> 17:10.430
(turns off radio)
Is that thing gone?

17:10.430 --> 17:11.864
You are officially possum-free.

17:11.864 --> 17:13.733
Thank you,
thank you, thank you.

17:13.733 --> 17:16.435
If you didn't turn up,
I don't think I could step
into my house again.

17:16.435 --> 17:17.904
How did it get
in here, anyway?

17:17.904 --> 17:19.138
How do you think? Wade.

17:19.138 --> 17:21.340
He also stole my shampoo,
and I think

17:21.340 --> 17:23.810
he reset all of my
relaxing radio stations.

17:23.810 --> 17:26.579
Tonight was supposed
to be the happiest night
I had in BlueBell,

17:26.579 --> 17:28.115
and he is determined
to ruin it.

17:28.115 --> 17:29.349
I have to figure out

17:29.349 --> 17:31.418
a way to get back at him.
No, no, no, no.

17:31.418 --> 17:33.186
Keep your eye on tonight.

17:33.186 --> 17:35.622
Tonight, your perfect
romantic night with Judson.

17:35.622 --> 17:38.057
Maybe I can short-circuit
the electricity when his band

17:38.057 --> 17:39.926
comes over to practice.
Come back,

17:39.926 --> 17:42.462
romance, dancing.

17:42.462 --> 17:44.664
You are absolutely right.

17:44.664 --> 17:46.366
Sanity restored.

17:46.366 --> 17:48.235
Judson. It's gonna be amazing.

17:48.235 --> 17:50.203
What are you gonna do
with Courtney Ann?

17:50.203 --> 17:51.604
Uh, not much.

17:51.604 --> 17:54.607
Actually, I wanted
to talk to you
about something.

17:54.607 --> 17:56.843
I think he reprogrammed
allof my radio stations!

17:56.843 --> 17:58.478
Sorry, what were you gonna say?

17:59.346 --> 18:01.514
Um... no, it's-it's okay.

18:01.514 --> 18:03.383
I better get to
Courtney Ann's,

18:03.383 --> 18:06.219
and you better get ready
for your date with Judson.

18:06.219 --> 18:08.221
Yes, I will.
Definitely will.

18:08.221 --> 18:11.624
How about... fire ants
in his underwear drawer!

18:11.624 --> 18:13.826
(laughs):
That'll leave a mark.

18:15.728 --> 18:17.330
Hey. I'm so sorry.

18:17.330 --> 18:19.932
I heard you ran
into Al today.
I hope you didn't

18:19.932 --> 18:21.067
pay him any mind.

18:21.067 --> 18:22.369
My ex has a flair
for the dramatic.

18:22.369 --> 18:24.137
He's trying to get you back?

18:24.137 --> 18:25.505
Yeah, but it's not gonna work.

18:25.505 --> 18:27.006
I don't love him anymore.

18:27.006 --> 18:29.108
How long were y'all together?

18:29.108 --> 18:31.678
Five years. But...
That's a long time.

18:31.678 --> 18:32.545
There's history.

18:32.545 --> 18:34.347
And clearly, it's not over.

18:34.347 --> 18:36.383
It is over.
I just said that.

18:36.383 --> 18:38.585
Why are you being like this?

18:42.255 --> 18:44.491
You know... I think it's best

18:44.491 --> 18:46.793
if we just cool
things off for a while.

18:46.793 --> 18:50.397
Huh? I thought we were going
to the Sweetie Pie Dance.

18:50.397 --> 18:53.400
I think you need
to deal with Al tonight.

18:53.400 --> 18:55.402
He drove all this way.

19:04.911 --> 19:06.946
What?
Hey.

19:06.946 --> 19:09.549
Wade's still not home.
Oh, that's okay, Joelle.
I'm here to talk to you.

19:09.549 --> 19:11.518
I was just wondering what you
and Wade were up to tonight.

19:11.518 --> 19:13.119
We're thinking of
going to Mobile.

19:13.119 --> 19:15.888
Okay. Well, do you
think you could be done
with him by 11:00?

19:15.888 --> 19:16.623
Why?

19:16.623 --> 19:18.258
Oh, man.

19:18.258 --> 19:19.892
This is awkward.

19:19.892 --> 19:21.261
I thought Wade told you.

19:21.261 --> 19:22.995
See, all that fighting we do,

19:22.995 --> 19:24.497
(whispers):
it's foreplay.

19:25.832 --> 19:28.601
Tell Wade I am sorry
if I let the cat out of the bag.

19:28.601 --> 19:30.537
But still, if you could
be done with him by 11:00,

19:30.537 --> 19:32.405
that would be fantastic.
Thanks.

19:32.405 --> 19:33.740
(clicks tongue)

19:35.808 --> 19:37.577
OTIS:
 Well, y'all's pathetic.

19:37.577 --> 19:41.180
I mean, who doesn't
remember if they mail

19:41.180 --> 19:42.749
their own
Save the Dates?

19:42.749 --> 19:45.852
Man, what color
are the envelopes?
Oh, they're silver.

19:45.852 --> 19:47.254
Silver.

19:47.720 --> 19:49.021
Nope, nope.

19:49.021 --> 19:51.258
I'm sorry, George, ain't
nothing in here but, uh,

19:51.258 --> 19:54.694
little Jamie Ports'
invites to her ninth
birthday par...

19:54.694 --> 19:56.095
Oh, look.

19:56.095 --> 19:58.531
They invited me.

20:02.068 --> 20:03.736
What am I gonna do now?

20:03.736 --> 20:06.839
Well... you're just
gonna have to tell Lemon

20:06.839 --> 20:08.675
tonight at the dance.

20:08.675 --> 20:10.176
(low grunt)

20:10.176 --> 20:13.112
Whew! Well, thank God
you are gonna be there
to block for me. Whew!

20:13.112 --> 20:15.715
What are you talking about?
I'm not gonna be there.

20:15.715 --> 20:17.216
Lemon said you're
taking Agnes.

20:17.216 --> 20:18.385
(laughs):
Agnes?!

20:18.385 --> 20:19.752
Yeah.
(laughing):
No...!

20:19.752 --> 20:21.488
Said you asked her
at your office today.

20:21.488 --> 20:22.789
No, I didn't.

20:22.789 --> 20:25.792
No, I, you know,
I-I asked her about her pies,

20:25.792 --> 20:29.028
and Lemon said that, you know,
she was in great demand,

20:29.028 --> 20:32.765
and that maybe we ought
to do something about it...
Mm.

20:33.800 --> 20:35.735
Good Lord.
Yeah.

20:35.735 --> 20:38.237
Maybe I did.
(clicks tongue)

20:38.237 --> 20:40.239
How did that happen?

20:40.239 --> 20:42.442
Lemon.
Lemon.

20:46.379 --> 20:49.248
Judson, hi.
Hey, I'm running late.

20:49.248 --> 20:51.083
Could I just meet you
at the dance?

20:51.083 --> 20:52.319
Is everything okay?

20:53.320 --> 20:55.121
JOELLE:
Zoe Hart?!
Hey! Take it easy!

20:55.121 --> 20:56.989
It is now.

20:56.989 --> 20:59.492
Okay. Bye.

20:59.492 --> 21:02.395
Whoa, whoa! Whoa, whoa!
Of all people!

21:02.395 --> 21:03.996
Just take it easy!
Her?!

21:03.996 --> 21:05.532
(Wade groans)

21:07.634 --> 21:10.670
Okay, so we both just need
to hold our ground.

21:10.670 --> 21:13.440
Yep.
I will tell Lemon about
the Save the Dates, and you

21:13.440 --> 21:15.274
tell her you don't want
to go to the dance.

21:15.274 --> 21:16.876
Yeah.
Okay.

21:16.876 --> 21:18.044
Showtime.

21:18.044 --> 21:21.013
Okay, here we go.

21:21.013 --> 21:23.149
LEMON:
Well...

21:23.149 --> 21:24.784
what do you think?

21:24.784 --> 21:27.420
Do you like my new dress?
I bought it special.

21:27.420 --> 21:29.021
(Lemon giggles)

21:30.323 --> 21:31.458
Agnes...

21:31.458 --> 21:32.792
(clears throat)

21:32.792 --> 21:34.994
(sighs)

21:36.696 --> 21:38.197
I hope...

21:38.197 --> 21:40.533
you brought your dancing shoes,

21:40.533 --> 21:42.569
because I may
be a doctor

21:42.569 --> 21:44.337
but I do know how to cut a rug.

21:44.337 --> 21:45.672
(both laughing)

21:45.672 --> 21:48.475
LEMON:
See? Tonight is gonna
be just perfect!

21:51.177 --> 21:53.780
* *

22:17.837 --> 22:19.606
Hey, Doc.

22:19.606 --> 22:21.508
Joelle and I are headed
to the movies.

22:21.508 --> 22:22.842
Just wanted to say,

22:22.842 --> 22:26.779
you and Judson,
you have a great night tonight.

22:34.053 --> 22:35.688
(engine starts)

22:37.690 --> 22:39.692
(sighs)

22:43.362 --> 22:46.899
Wade, that's my phone.

22:46.899 --> 22:48.067
Wade.

22:49.101 --> 22:51.103
But...

22:51.103 --> 22:52.972
(car leaving)

22:55.241 --> 22:57.376
The BlueBell
Sweetie Pie Dance

22:57.376 --> 22:59.211
has officially begun.

22:59.211 --> 23:00.780
(applause)

23:02.682 --> 23:04.684
SHELLEY:
I knew I should
have put lower odds

23:04.684 --> 23:06.519
on the two of those
breaking up tonight.

23:06.519 --> 23:07.654
Girl can't resist the urge

23:07.654 --> 23:09.255
to stand the man
up in public.

23:09.255 --> 23:11.758
(sighs)
* Once you were
a straight shot *

23:11.758 --> 23:15.227
* A shiny quarter
in a new slot *

23:15.227 --> 23:19.766
* Night would keep the dreams
that you got *

23:19.766 --> 23:23.369
* For afternoon... *

23:23.369 --> 23:25.337
BRICK:
So you made
all these pies?

23:25.337 --> 23:26.739
AGNES (laughing):
Yes.

23:26.739 --> 23:28.641
Uh, but I made
the pie crust in bulk,

23:28.641 --> 23:29.809
so it was
just a question

23:29.809 --> 23:31.310
of rolling
and kneading

23:31.310 --> 23:33.513
and filling.

23:33.513 --> 23:35.247
Yeah, right.

23:35.247 --> 23:37.450
Right.

23:38.618 --> 23:40.687
Would you like to try
the Boston cream?

23:40.687 --> 23:42.021
Oh, you know what?

23:42.021 --> 23:43.890
I'm, I'm so full at
the moment, thanks.

23:43.890 --> 23:45.525
Oh, okay.

23:45.525 --> 23:47.093
Didi, what are you doing here?

23:47.093 --> 23:48.928
Helping out my boss, not that
it's any of your business.

23:48.928 --> 23:50.463
I don't want
to talk to you.

23:52.532 --> 23:54.534
(Zoe grunting)

23:54.534 --> 23:56.569
Damn it, Wade.

23:56.569 --> 23:57.904
I'm coming, Judson.

24:00.339 --> 24:02.274
(screams)

24:02.274 --> 24:03.610
(crashes)

24:03.610 --> 24:04.844
Remember that time when
Wade brought Tansy here

24:04.844 --> 24:06.879
and her and Shelley
got into it

24:06.879 --> 24:08.481
over the last
piece of rhubarb?

24:08.481 --> 24:09.482
(chuckles)

24:09.482 --> 24:11.751
GEORGE:
Lemon.

24:11.751 --> 24:13.285
They're not even talking.

24:13.285 --> 24:14.987
Let them alone, okay?

24:14.987 --> 24:16.856
Your poor father doesn't
even want to be here.

24:16.856 --> 24:18.224
(chuckles)

24:18.224 --> 24:20.226
He doesn't know what he wants,
but I'm his daughter--

24:20.226 --> 24:21.427
I know what's best.

24:21.427 --> 24:23.195
You're his daughter,
not his mother.

24:23.195 --> 24:24.463
Okay, now,
this was supposed

24:24.463 --> 24:26.165
to be our romantic night
in case you forgot

24:26.165 --> 24:27.967
in the middle
of helping your dad and Agnes

24:27.967 --> 24:29.636
and decorating
the entire town.

24:29.636 --> 24:31.370
All right...

24:31.370 --> 24:32.939
(mouthing)

24:35.241 --> 24:37.243
I'm gonna get
a drink.

24:42.481 --> 24:44.483
Judson.

24:44.483 --> 24:46.152
(panting)

24:46.152 --> 24:48.220
I am so,
so sorry.

24:48.220 --> 24:49.756
Wade locked me in my house.

24:49.756 --> 24:51.658
He did what?
I know.

24:51.658 --> 24:53.359
I had to climb out
a second-story window

24:53.359 --> 24:55.027
and down a tree
to get here.

24:55.027 --> 24:56.729
Look, I just wanted
tonight to be perfect.

24:56.729 --> 24:59.298
Now I am a mess.

24:59.298 --> 25:03.402
I smell and I think I may have
a family of spiders in my hair.

25:03.402 --> 25:04.771
People seemed
to have put money down

25:04.771 --> 25:06.505
on whether you were going
to stand me up or not.

25:06.505 --> 25:10.309
I would never do that... again.

25:10.309 --> 25:12.144
Do you want to leave, just
forget this whole thing?

25:12.144 --> 25:13.412
Zoe Hart, you know
what I'd like to do?

25:13.412 --> 25:15.815
Oh, thank you.

25:15.815 --> 25:16.949
Dance.

25:18.651 --> 25:21.120
Looky-look what I found.

25:21.120 --> 25:22.054
Thank the Lord.

25:22.054 --> 25:23.656
Oh, where did
you find 'em?

25:23.656 --> 25:25.457
Stopped at the Dixie Stop
to get some ice cream

25:25.457 --> 25:28.094
and rent a movie, and I looked
down and there they were.

25:28.094 --> 25:29.629
Oh, that's right,
that's right,

25:29.629 --> 25:32.131
I went to the Dixie Stop
to get a cup of coffee.

25:33.332 --> 25:36.636
Thank you so much, Didi.
You... you saved my ass.

25:36.636 --> 25:39.038
Glad I could help,
but a word of advice:

25:39.038 --> 25:40.506
never, ever tell
Lemon what you did.

25:40.506 --> 25:42.675
She finds out you lost
those invitations,

25:42.675 --> 25:43.943
she's gonna
think the worst.

25:43.943 --> 25:45.077
You know what I
mean by the worst?

25:45.077 --> 25:46.813
Like, you really
don't want...

25:46.813 --> 25:49.816
Yeah, Didi, Didi,
I... get it.

25:49.816 --> 25:52.484
Okay, okay, uh, do you
want me to drop these off

25:52.484 --> 25:53.953
in the mailbox for you?

25:55.221 --> 25:57.023
No, you know what?

25:57.023 --> 25:58.925
Just, uh, just leave 'em
at my office for me.

25:58.925 --> 26:00.159
I'll take care
of it tomorrow.

26:00.159 --> 26:01.628
(song ends, applause)

26:01.628 --> 26:03.095
Okay.

26:11.503 --> 26:14.206
* Nothing fancy, nothing fake *

26:15.274 --> 26:18.277
* Nothing wasted
and no deal to make *

26:18.277 --> 26:22.248
* What you need
is what you want to take *

26:22.248 --> 26:25.451
* And what you take,
you use... *

26:25.451 --> 26:27.419
LAVON:
Uh, Zoe, Zoe, uh,

26:27.419 --> 26:28.855
Wade just texted me.

26:28.855 --> 26:30.657
He's looking for you,
says it's an emergency,

26:30.657 --> 26:31.991
you need
to go home.

26:31.991 --> 26:33.525
As if I'm gonna
fall for that.

26:33.525 --> 26:34.526
Nice try, Wade.

26:34.526 --> 26:35.862
Lavon, text him back

26:35.862 --> 26:37.797
and tell him to blow
it out his wazoo.

26:37.797 --> 26:39.298
Judson and I
are dancing.

26:39.298 --> 26:41.267
Wazoo?

26:41.267 --> 26:43.002
Mm-hmm.

26:43.002 --> 26:45.271
Okay.

26:45.271 --> 26:46.305
W-A...

26:46.305 --> 26:47.506
An emergency?

26:47.506 --> 26:49.842
This means war.
Zoe, let's not
get into...

26:49.842 --> 26:52.812
We have to figure out a
way to get back at him.
We do?

26:52.812 --> 26:55.247
Yeah.
'Cause I was thinking maybe
we could just grab some punch

26:55.247 --> 26:57.216
and a moonlit walk...
Judson, give me your phone.

26:57.216 --> 26:59.118
Seriously?

26:59.118 --> 27:00.252
Yeah.

27:00.252 --> 27:04.090
* You don't even have
to hold on... *

27:04.090 --> 27:05.624
Mr. Mayor, hey.

27:05.624 --> 27:07.727
Hey, Brick.

27:07.727 --> 27:09.495
I haven't seen Didi.

27:09.495 --> 27:10.496
She okay?

27:10.496 --> 27:13.065
Uh, we didn't work out.

27:14.100 --> 27:16.102
Oh.

27:18.304 --> 27:21.674
Didi is great, but I get it.

27:21.674 --> 27:23.843
There is no point in
continuing a relationship

27:23.843 --> 27:27.780
with someone if
it isn't there.

27:27.780 --> 27:30.216
You know, I spent 20 years

27:30.216 --> 27:33.052
coming to this
dance with my wife

27:33.052 --> 27:38.224
and the last 12 Sweetie Pies
home with her pictures.

27:38.224 --> 27:40.192
Well,

27:40.192 --> 27:43.162
nothing has made
me miss her more

27:43.162 --> 27:45.998
than coming to this dance
with the wrong girl.

27:45.998 --> 27:48.534
* Soft as a woman,
strong as a man... *

27:48.534 --> 27:49.802
(grunts)

27:49.802 --> 27:52.004
* Throws your head back... *

27:52.004 --> 27:53.472
Okay, okay, I am a genius.

27:53.472 --> 27:56.075
I just sent Wade's girlfriend
a dozen roses from him

27:56.075 --> 27:57.509
with a note
that says "I love you."

27:57.509 --> 27:58.510
(laughs)

27:58.510 --> 27:59.511
Isn't that great?

27:59.511 --> 28:00.947
Okay, we can dance now, sorry.

28:00.947 --> 28:03.549
I promise that is the last time
I mention the name...

28:03.549 --> 28:05.017
Wade Kinsella?

28:05.017 --> 28:06.418
Hey, didn't you
get my message?

28:06.418 --> 28:08.320
There's an emergency--
Rose is over at my place,

28:08.320 --> 28:10.556
she's got a nasty
cut, she's hurt.
That is not possible.

28:10.556 --> 28:12.558
She is with her friend
Courtney Ann.

28:12.558 --> 28:13.993
Don't you know anything?

28:13.993 --> 28:15.962
You've been here
for four months.

28:15.962 --> 28:17.429
That is Courtney Ann.

28:17.429 --> 28:19.565
ZOE:
What?

28:19.565 --> 28:21.000
Come on, Judson,
we have to go.

28:21.000 --> 28:24.036
You know what? That's okay,
I'm just gonna...

28:24.036 --> 28:24.971
What?

28:24.971 --> 28:27.306
I'll call you later.

28:27.306 --> 28:29.776
Go, go.

28:36.916 --> 28:38.717
Wade, I asked you
to get the real doctor.

28:38.717 --> 28:40.219
Move.
Hey, I'm sorry.

28:40.219 --> 28:41.620
I told them
not to get you.

28:41.620 --> 28:43.055
Of course they got me.
What happened?

28:43.055 --> 28:45.992
I thought it would be okay
if I stayed at my own house

28:45.992 --> 28:47.894
while my parents were gone,
but I got locked out,

28:47.894 --> 28:50.729
and apparently breaking
a window to get in

28:50.729 --> 28:52.498
isn't as easy as it
seems in the movies.

28:52.498 --> 28:54.233
(knocking)
Well, you need stitches.
Let's get you to my place.

28:54.233 --> 28:56.735
MAN:
Excuse me, is there
a Joelle here?

28:56.735 --> 28:58.304
Oh.

28:58.304 --> 28:59.438
Oh, Wade.

28:59.438 --> 29:02.008
I love you, too.

29:02.008 --> 29:04.610
Wait, w-wait, I, I,

29:04.610 --> 29:05.744
I didn't send
you flowers.

29:05.744 --> 29:07.746
Why would I send you
flowers?

29:07.746 --> 29:09.748
Why would you send me flowers?

29:09.748 --> 29:11.583
Okay, hey...

29:11.583 --> 29:13.019
So let me get this straight.

29:13.019 --> 29:15.321
You lost
our Save the Date cards?

29:15.321 --> 29:17.289
Well, Didi found them.

29:17.289 --> 29:20.159
So they haven't been
mailed out yet?

29:20.159 --> 29:21.861
Because it's three months
before the wedding

29:21.861 --> 29:23.762
and proper decorum states...
This isn't about
proper decorum,

29:23.762 --> 29:25.197
Lemon, this is
about the fact

29:25.197 --> 29:27.733
that I lost our
wedding invitations.

29:27.733 --> 29:30.269
Hey, listen,
it was irresponsible,

29:30.269 --> 29:31.270
but I forgive you.

29:31.270 --> 29:33.272
You fo...

29:34.907 --> 29:36.909
You know what?
Maybe it was more

29:36.909 --> 29:40.612
than just
irresponsible, Lemon.

29:40.612 --> 29:42.014
You have been
distracted

29:42.014 --> 29:45.651
and you have buried yourself
in project after project

29:45.651 --> 29:47.053
ever since Christmas.

29:47.053 --> 29:49.188
You've been moody and
you've been snappy,

29:49.188 --> 29:51.958
and we haven't connected
at all on any level

29:51.958 --> 29:53.459
in quite some time.

29:53.459 --> 29:55.361
It's like we don't even
know each other anymore

29:55.361 --> 29:57.063
and it's like you're
not even trying.

29:58.898 --> 30:00.867
George, what are you
trying to say?

30:00.867 --> 30:02.301
I think what I'm
saying is that I lost

30:02.301 --> 30:05.804
our Save the Date cards
because I'm having doubts.

30:22.688 --> 30:24.690
ZOE:
 Listen,

30:24.690 --> 30:27.693
the buck stops
here, okay?

30:27.693 --> 30:29.428
I am the grown-up,

30:29.428 --> 30:31.730
but you let me down.

30:31.730 --> 30:32.932
You shouldn't have lied.

30:32.932 --> 30:35.401
I am so, so,
so, so sorry.

30:35.401 --> 30:37.369
(sighs)

30:37.369 --> 30:39.138
What you did
was irresponsible.

30:39.138 --> 30:40.806
All this scheming
and breaking in

30:40.806 --> 30:42.141
just so you didn't
have to spend

30:42.141 --> 30:44.110
the weekend
with your parents?

30:45.945 --> 30:49.448
My parents...
don't get me.

30:49.448 --> 30:51.951
They think
I, like,

30:51.951 --> 30:55.321
fit in.

30:55.321 --> 30:57.289
It would crush them
to know the truth--

30:57.289 --> 30:59.358
that I only have
two friends,

30:59.358 --> 31:02.128
and they'd both rather be at
a dance than hang out with me.

31:02.128 --> 31:05.264
Hey, Rose, no dance
is more important than you.

31:05.264 --> 31:07.799
I tried to talk to you,
but you were so distracted.

31:07.799 --> 31:10.502
I'm sorry.

31:10.502 --> 31:13.405
It's just that Wade
makes me so crazy.

31:13.405 --> 31:16.375
Zoe, Wade likes you.

31:16.375 --> 31:17.944
Yeah, he acts like
an eighth grader

31:17.944 --> 31:21.880
and maybe that's how
I could recognize it,

31:21.880 --> 31:23.049
and I know it
isn't relevant

31:23.049 --> 31:24.984
since you have Judson,
who is perfect,

31:24.984 --> 31:29.021
but you should at
least be forgiving.

31:29.021 --> 31:31.857
Okay, I'll try.

31:31.857 --> 31:34.060
But you need
to get some sleep.

31:51.610 --> 31:53.612
What are you doing here?

31:58.017 --> 32:00.219
I want to tell you that...

32:02.921 --> 32:05.324
(sighs)
Okay.

32:05.324 --> 32:07.226
A year ago, I was
involved with a woman

32:07.226 --> 32:09.628
who broke my heart when
she chose someone else.

32:10.762 --> 32:14.967
Chose an old love
over a new one.

32:15.801 --> 32:18.204
And when I saw
you with Al

32:18.204 --> 32:21.974
and I heard he was here
to win you back...

32:23.575 --> 32:26.112
...all the pain
came flooding back.

32:26.912 --> 32:29.515
Lavon, no one knows

32:29.515 --> 32:32.618
what's gonna happen
between two people,

32:32.618 --> 32:34.886
and I'm sorry you had
your heart broken,

32:34.886 --> 32:37.189
but this is not
that relationship,

32:37.189 --> 32:42.161
and until yesterday
I was having such a good time.

32:42.961 --> 32:45.164
(chuckles)

32:46.298 --> 32:49.368
Well, you know, maybe a...

32:49.368 --> 32:53.072
a good time might be exactly
what Lavon Hayes needs.

33:05.584 --> 33:06.718
Sweetie pie.

33:09.555 --> 33:11.290
Sweetie pie.

33:14.960 --> 33:16.995
What are you doing home?
Hey.

33:16.995 --> 33:18.364
It's not even 10:00.
I know.

33:18.364 --> 33:21.667
Look, I-I took Agnes home early.
And I apologized.

33:21.667 --> 33:25.337
But let's just face it,
it wasn't meant to be.

33:25.337 --> 33:28.674
I mean, Agnes-- she's a
very nice woman, but...

33:28.674 --> 33:30.176
she's not your mother.

33:31.810 --> 33:35.013
It has been 12 years.

33:35.013 --> 33:37.749
When are you going
to finally see the truth?

33:37.749 --> 33:39.785
Mama doesn't love us.

33:39.785 --> 33:42.421
Now, that is not true.
Your mother had big dreams

33:42.421 --> 33:44.623
and she-she left
to pursue them.
No!

33:44.623 --> 33:47.626
She went to go find a new home
and a new family.

33:47.626 --> 33:48.560
Now stop that.

33:48.560 --> 33:50.262
I don't know
what kind of fantasy

33:50.262 --> 33:51.797
you're cooking up
in your head, but...

33:51.797 --> 33:54.766
You know, I'm not the one with
the fantasy, Daddy, okay?!

33:54.766 --> 33:57.103
I found her. I went to go see
her over Christmas.

33:57.103 --> 33:58.437
She's not a star
in Los Angeles.

33:58.437 --> 33:59.971
She's a fricking
housewife in Daphne.

33:59.971 --> 34:02.108
She wants nothing to do with us.

34:02.108 --> 34:04.443
That is not true...

34:04.443 --> 34:08.580
I'm sorry, but it is.

34:12.118 --> 34:14.085
(sobbing)

34:18.190 --> 34:20.391
* *

34:34.373 --> 34:38.510
Hey, how's Rose?

34:38.510 --> 34:42.348
She needed stitches,
and a friend.

34:42.348 --> 34:45.351
She's okay, though.
She's asleep inside.

34:45.351 --> 34:47.186
Listen, we need to talk.

34:47.186 --> 34:50.956
Judson, I am so sorry that
our night was ruined.

34:50.956 --> 34:52.558
You are...

34:52.558 --> 34:55.194
everything I ever imagined
I'd want in a guy.

34:55.194 --> 34:58.096
(chuckling)
You're sweet,

34:58.096 --> 35:01.032
kind, a doctor...

35:01.032 --> 35:03.235
Look, I was a total jerk.

35:03.235 --> 35:08.440
Please, please, please
let me make it up to you.

35:08.440 --> 35:10.542
I really do want this to work.

35:13.379 --> 35:16.782
You say that, but, Zoe,
let's face it...

35:16.782 --> 35:19.117
you were more excited about
your war with Wade tonight

35:19.117 --> 35:22.654
than you were
a romantic night with me.

35:22.654 --> 35:25.491
Doesn't that tell you
everything you need to know?

35:40.806 --> 35:43.409
* *

35:50.982 --> 35:53.185
Hey, Brick.
(sighs): Hey.

35:55.821 --> 35:57.022
You okay?

35:57.022 --> 35:59.591
Yeah. Yeah.

35:59.591 --> 36:02.228
Lemon finally told me about
Alice living in Daphne.

36:02.228 --> 36:03.629
Wait, Alice?

36:03.629 --> 36:05.864
And you two didn't have
to protect me from that.

36:05.864 --> 36:08.334
You know, I
could have handled it.
Wait, Brick, I didn't...

36:08.334 --> 36:10.902
What? You knew, didn't you?

36:12.738 --> 36:16.174
Oh, good Lord!

36:16.174 --> 36:18.043
When did she find out?

36:18.043 --> 36:19.711
Christmas. I...

36:19.711 --> 36:23.982
That explains the anxiety
medication, and the mood swings.

36:23.982 --> 36:25.451
Oh, my poor baby...

36:25.451 --> 36:27.753
Brick, I'm here for you
anytime you need to talk.

36:27.753 --> 36:30.489
I hope you know that.
No, no, thanks,
son, you go.

36:30.489 --> 36:32.591
(whispers):
All right, thanks.

36:36.695 --> 36:39.331
(sobbing)

36:42.901 --> 36:44.903
* *

36:50.276 --> 36:53.412
Go away, George.

36:53.412 --> 36:56.482
I don't need you or your
doubts here right now, okay?

37:01.520 --> 37:03.689
Lemon, I ran into your dad.

37:03.689 --> 37:04.856
(clears throat)

37:04.856 --> 37:07.293
Why on earth would you
not tell me about this?

37:07.293 --> 37:11.330
I mean,
I can only imagine...

37:15.066 --> 37:17.603
I sat in the car...

37:18.937 --> 37:21.740
...looking at her
with her new little girl.

37:21.740 --> 37:24.476
And I...

37:25.677 --> 37:29.415
I thought that I might crumble.

37:29.415 --> 37:32.050
Break into
a million little parts.

37:32.050 --> 37:34.586
Of course you did.

37:34.586 --> 37:36.455
That's why
you've been so distant.

37:36.455 --> 37:38.390
But why would you not tell me?

37:38.390 --> 37:39.825
Because honestly,

37:39.825 --> 37:42.193
I don't like you to see me
this way, okay?

37:42.193 --> 37:43.562
Lemon, why not?

37:46.465 --> 37:51.470
Because she taught me
to hide my weakness.

37:53.472 --> 37:57.809
And I tried to be the perfect
Southern belle for you,

37:57.809 --> 38:01.212
and for this town

38:01.212 --> 38:03.615
but mostly for her.

38:03.615 --> 38:07.486
Like it would bring
her back or something.

38:07.486 --> 38:09.020
What an idiot I am!

38:09.020 --> 38:11.122
(sobbing)

38:11.122 --> 38:18.196
My life has been a complete
and utter waste of time.

38:18.196 --> 38:20.466
No, no, don't you ever say that.

38:20.466 --> 38:22.568
I don't know who I am anymore.

38:22.568 --> 38:26.972
I am just a total mess.

38:29.140 --> 38:32.310
Babe, you're not a mess.

38:33.679 --> 38:35.481
You maybe could
use a tissue

38:35.481 --> 38:38.049
or... or two.

38:38.049 --> 38:39.951
Huh?

38:46.124 --> 38:49.795
Lemon... I love you.

38:49.795 --> 38:53.899
And I want to get to know
every part of you--

38:53.899 --> 38:55.901
the vulnerable side,
the crazy side.

38:55.901 --> 39:00.205
I don't care if it's perfect;
I just want you to be you.

39:00.205 --> 39:04.910
Okay? 'Cause without you,
there can't be us.

39:04.910 --> 39:06.445
And I want us back.

39:10.882 --> 39:14.019
Me, too.

39:14.019 --> 39:15.621
So much.

39:18.957 --> 39:20.692
(weeping)

39:26.398 --> 39:28.567
WADE:
 Psst!

39:33.104 --> 39:35.407
Don't you ever knock?

39:35.407 --> 39:38.143
Rose left her sweater
over at my house.

39:38.143 --> 39:41.713
And don't worry. I peeked in
the window to make sure

39:41.713 --> 39:44.783
you and Doc Collie-wood weren't,
you know, doing the nasty

39:44.783 --> 39:47.786
before I came in.
Oh, thanks.

39:47.786 --> 39:50.121
Um, but he broke up with me.

39:50.121 --> 39:51.289
Yeah, I heard.

39:51.289 --> 39:54.092
I'm sorry about that.

39:55.727 --> 39:59.230
Wade, let's face it...

39:59.230 --> 40:01.733
I have a certain
amount of charm.

40:01.733 --> 40:05.437
You and I have had
some chemistry...

40:05.437 --> 40:07.338
Why don't you just admit it?

40:07.338 --> 40:08.674
You like me.

40:11.943 --> 40:13.479
You know what?

40:13.479 --> 40:16.114
You're right. I do.

40:18.183 --> 40:20.085
I like you, Zoe.

40:20.085 --> 40:24.690
And, uh... it-it kills me
to see you with Judson.

40:24.690 --> 40:27.493
I-I can't stand it.

40:27.493 --> 40:29.661
All day I write

40:29.661 --> 40:33.131
"Mr. Wade Hart"
in my notebooks.

40:33.131 --> 40:37.836
Or there was a town pool about
when y'all would break up.

40:37.836 --> 40:40.472
And I had, uh... I had
a hundred bucks on tonight.

40:40.472 --> 40:43.041
(laughing):
Yeah.

40:43.041 --> 40:45.977
I'm gonna go smooth things
out with my girl, but, uh...

40:45.977 --> 40:48.113
this should buy a
lot of malt liquor.

40:48.113 --> 40:50.982
Night, now.

40:53.118 --> 40:55.887
Oh, that was... oh, my!

40:55.887 --> 40:58.924
Now I understand how you
have so many trophies.

40:58.924 --> 41:00.659
High five.

41:00.659 --> 41:02.761
I'd love some water.

41:02.761 --> 41:03.562
Water.

41:03.562 --> 41:05.997
I'll be right back.

41:05.997 --> 41:07.766
Don't move.

41:07.766 --> 41:10.035
Ready for the
second quarter.

41:22.981 --> 41:24.015
(grunts)

41:41.900 --> 41:46.037
