00:10.133 --> 00:11.612
- Morning, y'all.
- Morning.

00:11.773 --> 00:14.241
- Happy Halloween.
- Good morning.

00:14.413 --> 00:17.769
What is this bill, Vivian?
Two thousand dollars for flowers?

00:17.973 --> 00:20.851
- That's for Trevor's perpetual care.
- What?

00:21.053 --> 00:23.123
He was Hilary's fiancé.

00:23.333 --> 00:25.289
They get you coming,
they get you going.

00:27.093 --> 00:30.608
I can't believe it's been two months
since Trevor's bungee accident.

00:30.973 --> 00:33.009
Thank God,
Hilary seems to be doing better.

00:33.173 --> 00:36.245
For a while there,
she seemed so crushed.

00:36.453 --> 00:38.523
Not any more than Trevor.

00:41.973 --> 00:44.806
Hilary is just exhibiting
that old Banks resiliency.

00:44.973 --> 00:47.965
Why, if you ask me,
I'd say she's back to normal.

00:48.133 --> 00:49.964
Whatever that is.

00:51.973 --> 00:53.804
Guess who
I'm going out with tonight?

00:54.013 --> 00:56.129
- Who, sweetheart?
- Trevor.

02:08.173 --> 02:10.128
Hil, Hil, listen.

02:11.253 --> 02:13.972
About you dating Trevor...

02:14.133 --> 02:16.852
Oh, gosh, how can I put this gently?

02:17.453 --> 02:19.409
I can't, he's dead.

02:19.773 --> 02:21.570
Will, Hilary's been through a lot.

02:21.733 --> 02:24.566
I'm sure she has a rational explanation
for what she's saying.

02:24.733 --> 02:26.325
Of course, I do.

02:26.493 --> 02:29.610
There's a TV psychic
who can channel Trevor's spirit.

02:32.573 --> 02:34.325
Okay, I owe you one.

02:34.733 --> 02:37.964
His name is Skorpius
and I've arranged for a séance.

02:38.133 --> 02:39.407
Hilary, sweetheart.

02:39.573 --> 02:42.531
You don't really believe
in this séance mumbo jumbo, do you?

02:42.693 --> 02:46.083
Believe in it?
I spent 300 dollars for it.

02:46.293 --> 02:48.727
Honey, you spent
300 dollars on a séance?

02:48.933 --> 02:52.608
Not on the séance, for the séance.
I needed a new hat.

02:52.973 --> 02:56.488
The 1000 dollars Skorpius is charging,
I just put on Daddy's gold card.

02:56.653 --> 02:59.292
Now, I can say goodbye to Trevor.

03:00.893 --> 03:04.169
I don't know. If you ask me,
it would be cheaper to just dig him up.

03:05.613 --> 03:08.207
Skorpius says I need to bring
at least four loved ones...

03:08.413 --> 03:10.847
...to create enough psychic energy
to reach Trevor.

03:11.013 --> 03:12.924
So, what do you guys say?

03:13.133 --> 03:16.762
I say, thank God, I'm not a loved one.

03:18.053 --> 03:19.532
You don't understand.

03:19.693 --> 03:23.083
Trevor's bungee accident
left everything up in the air.

03:27.613 --> 03:29.843
I need closure.

03:30.053 --> 03:31.964
I for one would be happy
to go with you.

03:32.133 --> 03:35.967
And I'm sure everyone else here
would too. Wouldn't we?

03:36.493 --> 03:40.611
- Oh, I gotta go do my costume.
- I'll help you.

03:40.813 --> 03:42.132
Me too.

03:42.293 --> 03:44.170
I can't believe you people.

03:44.333 --> 03:46.449
How can you do this to me?

03:50.133 --> 03:53.603
I guess we're just not
a close family anymore.

03:54.773 --> 04:00.245
I guess Hilary's wellbeing
just is not important.

04:00.413 --> 04:04.486
I guess nobody cares for her
the way I do.

04:09.973 --> 04:13.170
I'll go with you, Aunt Viv.
I can go to my party later, okay?

04:13.853 --> 04:16.606
All right, all right, all right,
I'm on board.

04:21.093 --> 04:24.290
But it'll cut
into my trick-or-treating time.

04:26.813 --> 04:29.168
Oh, all right.

04:30.013 --> 04:31.924
Come on, Will. Let's go tell Hilary.

04:33.453 --> 04:35.648
Learn from me, child.

04:40.773 --> 04:44.652
Oh, yes,
the little kiddies have arrived.

04:44.813 --> 04:46.485
Oh, how I adore dressing up...

04:46.653 --> 04:50.362
...for those adorable little ghosts
and goblins every year.

04:55.053 --> 04:56.486
Trick...

04:57.933 --> 05:00.401
Hey, you forgot your candy!

05:13.853 --> 05:15.525
Geoffrey.

05:15.693 --> 05:18.287
It's Halloween. It's supposed
to be fun for the children.

05:18.453 --> 05:21.047
Oh, tell it to Barney.

05:29.533 --> 05:31.091
Hi, Will.

05:31.893 --> 05:33.326
Oh, boy, I love this.

05:33.493 --> 05:36.087
Halloween, the only night
a black man can walk around...

05:36.253 --> 05:39.051
...in this neighborhood with a mask on
and not get arrested.

05:44.173 --> 05:48.052
Oh, what a night. I made a killing.
Twenty-six Milky Ways.

05:48.213 --> 05:51.091
And the Democrats say
there's a recession.

05:51.893 --> 05:53.451
What are you supposed to be?

05:54.173 --> 05:56.733
My idol, Macaulay Culkin.

05:58.613 --> 05:59.966
You know why he's my idol?

06:00.173 --> 06:02.448
Why?
Because y'all the same height?

06:03.413 --> 06:06.928
No, because his movies have grossed
over half a billion dollars worldwide.

06:07.333 --> 06:10.769
Not to mention,
he's one heck of an actor.

06:11.893 --> 06:15.363
Let's go, everyone.
I don't wanna keep Trevor waiting.

06:16.213 --> 06:18.932
What's the rush?
Ain't like he going nowhere.

06:25.813 --> 06:27.769
I hate L.A. Smog.

06:30.133 --> 06:31.851
Where's Will?

06:34.853 --> 06:37.526
I'm sorry, I'm stupid. I'm stupid.

06:41.373 --> 06:43.682
This is fine, isn't it?

06:49.093 --> 06:52.483
Oh, we got to get one of them
in the girls' locker room.

06:58.213 --> 07:02.206
- Wow, this place is really creepy.
- I know.

07:02.373 --> 07:05.445
Who would put a deco table
on a Persian rug?

07:07.133 --> 07:09.124
Skorpius.

07:09.293 --> 07:10.726
Hello.

07:10.893 --> 07:12.372
Is anybody here?

07:15.333 --> 07:17.847
I am Skorpius the Magnificent.

07:18.013 --> 07:20.004
I see all.

07:20.413 --> 07:23.485
I know all.

07:23.653 --> 07:25.006
Who are you?

07:25.773 --> 07:27.604
We have an appointment.
We're the Banks...

07:27.773 --> 07:30.571
Stop, don't tell me...

07:31.293 --> 07:33.443
You're the Banks family.

07:39.973 --> 07:43.363
I love when a man pulls my chair out.

07:43.973 --> 07:46.646
- Come, come, sit.
- I want to sit close to the door.

07:46.813 --> 07:48.326
That was decent. That was decent.

07:48.493 --> 07:50.006
Yeah, well.

07:54.253 --> 07:56.084
Nice shot.

07:56.933 --> 07:58.412
Now...

07:58.573 --> 08:02.930
Make ready to contact the spirits.

08:03.413 --> 08:07.042
Seem like somebody made contact
with one too many spirits, you know:

08:08.653 --> 08:11.804
Mr. Skorpius, do you really think
you can reach Trevor?

08:11.973 --> 08:15.682
- Lf he's up there, I'll find him.
- Hey, look, Skorpius, check it out.

08:15.853 --> 08:18.287
While you're there,
see if you can find Marvin Gaye...

08:18.453 --> 08:20.409
...and find out
what was really going on.

08:21.053 --> 08:22.327
That was a good one.

08:23.613 --> 08:28.129
I will now make contact
with Trevor Collins.

08:29.093 --> 08:30.526
Everyone join hands.

08:34.212 --> 08:37.727
Spirit guides, I summon you.

08:37.893 --> 08:40.804
This humble earthly vessel awaits.

08:40.972 --> 08:43.282
Fill me with your essence.

08:45.813 --> 08:48.885
Seem like some medium
ain't paid their electric bill, huh?

08:49.533 --> 08:52.127
I'm getting a message
from the spirits.

08:52.293 --> 08:56.445
Oh, they wish me to tell you:
"Shut your pie hole."

08:58.973 --> 09:01.282
I feel a presence in the room.

09:01.773 --> 09:04.162
A tall, good-looking man...

09:04.333 --> 09:07.882
...whose life revolves around news.

09:09.493 --> 09:12.849
That's Trevor.
I know his vibration.

09:16.693 --> 09:19.491
Trevor, I think about you constantly.

09:19.653 --> 09:22.451
And I, about you.

09:22.613 --> 09:24.331
I wish I could see you.

09:24.493 --> 09:27.485
I wish I could see you too.

09:28.933 --> 09:31.925
I thought they was boring
when he was alive.

09:32.093 --> 09:34.561
Trevor, now that we can talk...

09:34.733 --> 09:37.805
...there's something I've wanted
to ask you since the day you died.

09:37.973 --> 09:41.329
Of course, Hilary. Ask me anything.

09:41.493 --> 09:44.007
Do you know where I left
my black suede purse?

09:45.093 --> 09:47.163
Your black suede purse?

09:47.333 --> 09:49.244
Well, now, let me think.

09:51.973 --> 09:53.406
Please.

09:53.573 --> 09:56.883
Come on, man, I could be sucking
on some honey neck bone right now.

09:58.293 --> 10:00.284
Oh, the connection is fading.

10:01.013 --> 10:03.402
I'm losing it. I'm losing it.

10:03.893 --> 10:06.168
Oh, like you ever had it.

10:06.893 --> 10:10.852
- Come back.
- Yes, Trevor, don't go.

10:13.293 --> 10:15.011
Trevor has left the building.

10:19.093 --> 10:22.005
I didn't get a chance to say goodbye.

10:22.573 --> 10:24.006
Couldn't we try again?

10:24.293 --> 10:26.932
I couldn't possibly traverse
the void again.

10:27.093 --> 10:28.890
Tonight, that is.

10:29.053 --> 10:30.645
Of course, there's always tomorrow.

10:31.213 --> 10:34.489
<i>And miss Saved By The Bell?
I don't think so.</i>

10:34.653 --> 10:37.451
Oh, let's have a look-see.

10:40.653 --> 10:43.963
You know,
I could fit you in around 7...

10:44.133 --> 10:47.205
...right between
the exorcism and step class.

10:47.373 --> 10:50.365
- Daddy?
- No, I don't think so.

10:50.533 --> 10:53.445
And I think I'd like
my 1000 dollars back, please.

10:53.613 --> 10:57.242
Oh, I'm terribly sorry,
but the spirits don't give refunds.

11:00.213 --> 11:01.646
Uncle...

11:02.773 --> 11:06.004
Listen, Scrupulous.

11:06.853 --> 11:09.242
I think you should just give
my uncle his money back.

11:09.413 --> 11:12.007
We all had a good laugh,
but this whole thing is bogus...

11:12.173 --> 11:14.129
...and you, sir, are a fake.

11:15.013 --> 11:18.369
Nobody calls me the F-word.

11:31.453 --> 11:33.762
From this day forward...

11:33.933 --> 11:37.721
...you will bring evil
to all those in your presence.

11:37.893 --> 11:41.283
You will end up alone
and forever hexed.

11:42.253 --> 11:44.130
I placed a curse on you.

11:51.853 --> 11:54.765
The whole thing
gave me the creeps, Geoffrey.

11:54.933 --> 11:57.288
Do you really think
a person can be cursed?

11:57.453 --> 12:00.251
How do you think I ended up here?

12:02.573 --> 12:05.167
Hey, y'all, check it out,
I got me a party to hit.

12:05.333 --> 12:10.043
So if I hook up with some babe tonight,
I promise to practice safe hex.

12:11.893 --> 12:13.645
This isn't funny, Will.

12:13.813 --> 12:16.725
- You ruined my séance.
- Forget the séance.

12:16.893 --> 12:19.726
He may have ruined our lives
once this hex kicks in.

12:19.893 --> 12:23.772
Cut it out, Carlton.
There is no such thing as a...

12:23.933 --> 12:25.491
Oh, my God.

12:25.653 --> 12:28.565
Carlton, what's that hideous thing
growing out of your neck?

12:28.733 --> 12:31.486
- What, what? Where, where?
- Hold on, hold on, hold on.

12:31.653 --> 12:33.291
Hold on. Hold on.

12:35.213 --> 12:38.125
Never mind. It's just your head.

12:41.773 --> 12:44.446
Hey, Hil, look.

12:44.613 --> 12:48.288
Trust me. Wherever Trevor is,
he loves you and he misses you.

12:48.893 --> 12:50.645
What about the hex?

12:51.293 --> 12:54.649
Look Macaulay,
there's no such thing as a hex.

12:55.613 --> 12:57.126
I'll get it.

12:57.973 --> 12:59.247
Hello.

12:59.413 --> 13:01.085
Yes, this is he.

13:02.133 --> 13:05.205
What? Is this some kind of a joke?

13:05.813 --> 13:07.132
Oh, that's preposterous.

13:07.293 --> 13:10.205
You're right, I will talk to my lawyer.

13:11.293 --> 13:12.851
Philip, what is it?

13:13.053 --> 13:15.931
The DA says he has proof
that I took bribes.

13:16.093 --> 13:17.446
- What?
- How?

13:17.613 --> 13:21.572
I've been suspended from the bench.
My reputation is destroyed, I'm ruined.

13:36.333 --> 13:38.210
Morning, Uncle Phil.

13:38.733 --> 13:41.042
Did you talk to your lawyer yet?

13:41.213 --> 13:44.683
I'm through, Will. I don't know why,
but the DA has it in for me.

13:44.853 --> 13:46.844
I could get 10 years.

13:47.013 --> 13:49.129
Uncle Phil, you're innocent, man.

13:50.853 --> 13:53.845
Dad, I just want you to know
that regardless of what happens...

13:54.013 --> 13:55.924
...I'll always be at your side.

13:59.173 --> 14:01.846
Carlton, what the hell
happened to your hair?

14:02.493 --> 14:05.166
Oh, no, you don't.
I'm not falling for that again.

14:10.013 --> 14:11.412
Oh, my hair.

14:11.573 --> 14:14.292
I look like a snow cone.
What happened?

14:15.413 --> 14:18.849
- The hex.
- Oh, Carlton. That's not it.

14:19.013 --> 14:21.573
That gold stuff must have done
something to your hair.

14:21.733 --> 14:23.246
Now, just... Just wash it out.

14:23.413 --> 14:25.802
- I did last night.
- Help! Help!

14:25.973 --> 14:27.406
- Ashley.
- Help!

14:27.573 --> 14:30.167
Somebody turn it off!

14:42.733 --> 14:45.406
What do you mean, that was out?
That was in!

14:45.573 --> 14:47.404
What's going on? I heard screams.

14:47.573 --> 14:50.371
Ashley was attacked
by the tennis-ball machine.

14:51.653 --> 14:53.245
Oh, thank goodness.

14:53.413 --> 14:56.883
For a moment there, I thought you'd
found those Polaroids of me in a tutu.

14:59.453 --> 15:03.332
New Year's Eve. A fellow gets crazy.

15:03.493 --> 15:04.812
You all right, sweetheart?

15:04.973 --> 15:07.851
I think I sprained my ankle,
and my big tournament is tomorrow.

15:08.013 --> 15:10.368
Why would the machine
go haywire like that?

15:10.533 --> 15:12.524
It's the you-know-what.

15:12.693 --> 15:15.571
I'm telling you, Dad,
it's gonna pick us off one by one...

15:15.733 --> 15:18.406
<i>...until we all end up
on Unsolved Mysteries.</i>

15:19.733 --> 15:21.769
Would you shut up with this hex.

15:21.933 --> 15:24.811
I mean, it's all just
one big coincidence.

15:32.013 --> 15:33.969
- Can I help you?
- Are you Geoffrey Butler?

15:34.133 --> 15:35.725
Yes, I am.

15:35.893 --> 15:38.885
And you must be
the woman of my dreams.

15:39.053 --> 15:40.930
You are.

15:43.973 --> 15:47.852
Geoffrey Butler, I'm agent Wanda Davis,
lmmigration and Naturalization.

15:48.013 --> 15:50.481
- You're in this country illegally.
- Uncle Phil.

15:50.653 --> 15:52.769
No buts, Butler.
You're being deported.

15:52.933 --> 15:55.652
- Let's go.
- Oh, God.

15:55.813 --> 15:57.963
The hex has gone international.

15:58.133 --> 16:00.522
Don't worry,
I'll get the best lawyer in town.

16:00.693 --> 16:03.127
I don't need a lawyer.

16:03.293 --> 16:07.332
What I need is a judge
who can be bought off, like you.

16:07.493 --> 16:10.132
I was framed, I tell you, framed.

16:10.573 --> 16:12.609
This is all your fault.

16:12.773 --> 16:15.810
Now, come on, Carlton.
I don't know what's going on here.

16:15.973 --> 16:18.885
But it don't have nothing to do
with no stupid hex.

16:19.053 --> 16:20.805
Isn't that right, Uncle Phil?

16:21.133 --> 16:23.693
I don't know
what to believe anymore, Will.

16:24.533 --> 16:27.366
Come on, Uncle Phil, not you too.

16:27.773 --> 16:30.731
Vivian. Vivian.

16:32.853 --> 16:34.571
Jazz.

16:36.773 --> 16:40.083
- Philip, do something.
- Hey, Dad.

16:40.253 --> 16:42.130
Now that I'm going
to be in the family...

16:42.293 --> 16:44.682
...maybe we could talk about
my trust fund.

16:45.173 --> 16:48.609
- What did you say?
- Jazz and I are getting married.

16:48.773 --> 16:50.684
Over his dead body.

16:51.293 --> 16:53.966
Excuse me,
but doesn't anybody care what I think?

16:54.133 --> 16:55.964
No.

16:56.133 --> 16:59.808
Well, Jazz does.
And that's why I've fallen for him.

17:00.253 --> 17:04.644
To think, all these years,
I never appreciated you.

17:04.813 --> 17:06.484
I love you, Snookums.

17:06.653 --> 17:09.041
Right back at you, Hilakums.

17:14.093 --> 17:16.560
I'll be in the kitchen throwing up.

17:16.733 --> 17:19.088
We're gonna name our first son
after you, Daddy.

17:19.573 --> 17:23.612
By the way, I thought
we could get started tonight.

17:23.813 --> 17:25.804
That's it.

17:32.493 --> 17:34.927
This is all your fault.
You got us all hexed.

17:35.093 --> 17:38.005
I want you packed
and out of here by tonight.

17:38.173 --> 17:40.368
But wait... Wait a minute,
Aunt Viv, what are?

17:40.533 --> 17:44.685
- Out!
- Aunt Viv. Wait a minute, this is me.

17:44.853 --> 17:46.206
Your little Willie.

17:46.373 --> 17:49.171
You know, the adorable, charismatic,
sometimes troublesome...

17:49.333 --> 17:53.042
...yet overall wonderful young man
you've grown to love.

17:53.213 --> 17:54.532
Don't throw me out. Listen.

17:54.693 --> 17:58.083
I'll go back to Skorpius,
and I'll get us all unhexed, okay?

18:01.893 --> 18:03.849
Hurry.

18:05.213 --> 18:07.169
Hurry.

18:09.853 --> 18:11.969
Hurry.

18:31.293 --> 18:32.965
That's strange.

18:34.373 --> 18:36.967
It's open, Mother, come on in.

18:40.893 --> 18:42.167
Who are you?

18:42.333 --> 18:44.722
Will Smith. Skorpius?

18:45.253 --> 18:48.051
That's my last name.
I'm Ralph Skorpius.

18:48.533 --> 18:50.251
What are you doing in my house?

18:50.533 --> 18:53.252
It's me. Remember? The vampire.

18:55.493 --> 18:58.485
You remember the séance,
the hex, the:

18:59.933 --> 19:03.209
Listen, take anything you want.
Just don't hurt me.

19:04.053 --> 19:06.647
Look, man, I didn't come here
to start no trouble.

19:06.813 --> 19:08.929
I just wanna apologize.

19:10.493 --> 19:12.768
What happened to this place, man?

19:12.933 --> 19:14.924
What happened to you?

19:15.093 --> 19:17.607
Anything you see here is yours.

19:18.253 --> 19:20.847
Please, take it all.

19:22.373 --> 19:25.285
Hey, look, Skorpius, man.

19:26.133 --> 19:28.886
Look, I don't know
what's going on here, all right?

19:29.053 --> 19:32.523
I just came to ask you
to break the hex, all right, man?

19:32.693 --> 19:34.763
I'm begging you, man.

19:35.813 --> 19:38.088
Why are you playing with me?

19:40.973 --> 19:43.965
I think I'm losing my family, man.

19:44.133 --> 19:46.408
I think I'm losing my mind.

19:46.573 --> 19:48.689
Why you can't just break
the hex, man?

19:49.773 --> 19:52.048
Break the hex!

19:53.253 --> 19:55.448
I don't want no vase, man.

19:55.613 --> 19:58.889
I just want you
to break the hex, all right?

19:59.613 --> 20:01.365
Break the hex!

20:04.013 --> 20:06.573
Break the hex, man.

20:06.733 --> 20:09.327
Can you break the hex?

20:09.493 --> 20:11.484
Break the hex.

20:14.573 --> 20:17.007
Break the hex, man.

20:17.173 --> 20:21.803
Why you can't break the hex, man?
Break the hex.

20:22.453 --> 20:23.966
- Will.
- Break the hex.

20:24.133 --> 20:26.363
Will, Will, wake up.

20:26.533 --> 20:29.047
Will, you were having a nightmare.

20:32.413 --> 20:35.485
Carlton. Your hair.

20:35.653 --> 20:39.089
Hey, what kind of dream
were you having, mister?

20:40.773 --> 20:42.684
Carlton, man.

20:42.853 --> 20:45.447
Listen, we was all hexed
and everything.

20:45.613 --> 20:47.092
Everything was going wrong...

20:47.253 --> 20:49.892
...and the whole family
was turning against me.

20:50.773 --> 20:53.412
Oh, it was a nightmare, man.

20:54.253 --> 20:56.369
It was so real.

20:56.693 --> 20:59.730
Well, I'm gonna go have
some breakfast. Wanna go?

20:59.933 --> 21:01.161
Oh, yeah.

21:01.333 --> 21:03.801
Breakfast, that's right.
With our family, right?

21:03.973 --> 21:06.248
- Yeah.
- Yeah, let's get to our family.

21:11.133 --> 21:13.044
- Morning, y'all.
- Morning.

21:13.213 --> 21:15.169
- Happy Halloween.
- Morning.

21:15.333 --> 21:16.812
What is this bill, Vivian?

21:16.973 --> 21:18.645
Two thousand dollars for flowers?

21:18.813 --> 21:21.407
- That's for Trevor's perpetual care.
- What?

21:21.573 --> 21:23.086
He was Hilary's fiancé.

21:23.253 --> 21:25.050
They get you coming,
they get you going.

21:25.493 --> 21:29.327
I can't believe it's been two months
since Trevor's bungee accident.

21:29.493 --> 21:31.370
Hey, hey wait a second, guys.

21:31.533 --> 21:34.331
Hey, let's talk about
something else here, right?

21:34.493 --> 21:36.529
Thank God
Hilary seems to be feeling better.

21:36.693 --> 21:39.765
For a while there,
she seemed so crushed.

21:39.933 --> 21:42.128
Not any more than Trevor.

21:43.813 --> 21:47.169
Hey, hey, hey, listen.
How about those Lakers, huh?

21:47.333 --> 21:49.722
Hilary is just exhibiting
that old Banks resiliency.

21:49.893 --> 21:53.602
Why, if you ask me,
I'd say she's practically back to normal.

21:53.773 --> 21:56.048
- Whatever that is.
- Whatever that is.

21:57.253 --> 21:59.084
Guess who
I'm going out with tonight?

21:59.253 --> 22:01.164
No, no, no.

22:01.333 --> 22:03.483
Let me out. Let me out.

22:03.653 --> 22:07.362
- Who, sweetheart?
- Ronnie, Bobby, Ricky, Mike?

22:08.693 --> 22:09.842
Trevor.

22:10.013 --> 22:16.043
No!

22:18.533 --> 22:20.763
In five, four, three, two.

22:20.933 --> 22:23.845
But it will cut into my trick or treats.

22:25.173 --> 22:26.447
Here we go.

22:26.613 --> 22:28.968
But it will cut into my trick or treats.

22:29.133 --> 22:30.532
I can't.

22:30.733 --> 22:32.963
I'm just gonna say my line and go.

22:39.053 --> 22:40.611
I can't get it out.

22:40.773 --> 22:42.604
- I cannot get it out.
- Come on, one more.

22:42.773 --> 22:44.092
Hold on, hold on.
