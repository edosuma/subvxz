WEBVTT

00:05.506 --> 00:09.259
All right, beach cleanup crew.
Let's hear it for Danny Rubin.

00:13.472 --> 00:16.265
Hey, hey, hey! No, no, no.
Maya, Maya, honey.

00:16.350 --> 00:18.810
-No, don't!
-Here. Let me help you.

00:18.894 --> 00:21.438
-Oh, no. I'm fine.
-Here. Let me help you. Here.

00:22.898 --> 00:24.107
Good turnout, huh?

00:24.191 --> 00:25.484
Oh, yeah. Totally.

00:26.527 --> 00:28.487
People are really
showing up for the campaign.

00:29.071 --> 00:31.698
So, I heard about your…

00:31.782 --> 00:34.034
Crime. Shame. Punishment.

00:34.117 --> 00:35.327
What the hell's going on?

00:35.410 --> 00:36.537
Money problems.

00:36.620 --> 00:40.165
Yeah, I hope that's okay. Jerry,
he kind of, you know, spilled the beans,

00:40.249 --> 00:42.668
and it sounds like
the guys are pretty upset.

00:43.252 --> 00:44.878
But I wanted to tell you…

00:44.962 --> 00:47.256
How good it feels to see my pants
pulled down in front of the whole--

00:47.339 --> 00:48.507
…I'm sorry.

00:48.590 --> 00:52.094
You must've been so stressed-out,
holding in that secret the whole time.

00:52.177 --> 00:54.096
You must be so relieved
it's out in the open.

00:54.888 --> 00:56.765
Oh, my gosh. Did you hurt yourself?

00:56.849 --> 00:58.892
No. No, I don't know what that is.

00:58.976 --> 01:00.811
Yes, you do. You know damn well.

01:01.478 --> 01:03.021
I think she's just hungry.

01:03.105 --> 01:06.441
Here. Honey. Maya. Want a banana?

01:06.525 --> 01:08.402
-You look so cute, by the way.
-Thank you.

01:08.485 --> 01:10.279
-Is she gonna be okay?
-I love your little--

01:10.362 --> 01:11.655
-Okay.
-Okay. Maya.

01:11.738 --> 01:13.156
I think she's just hungry.

01:13.240 --> 01:16.076
-I'm just gonna--
-Oh, my Gosh.

01:16.159 --> 01:20.163
-No! That's it. I'm done.
-What the hell is going on here?

01:20.247 --> 01:23.500
She's fine. She's just hungry.
I gotta take her home for some lunch.

01:23.584 --> 01:25.377
You're gonna leave before my big speech?

01:25.460 --> 01:28.297
She can't wait a few minutes?
We're all really hungry.

01:28.380 --> 01:30.090
She's a child.

01:30.924 --> 01:33.927
Yeah, fine. All right.
Just go straight home.

01:34.011 --> 01:37.806
Yeah, no secret trips
to the bank or gym or whatever.

01:37.890 --> 01:40.434
Whatever, you fucking scrawny, greasy…

01:40.517 --> 01:42.477
-Sure thing.
-…homeless fucking loser.

01:42.561 --> 01:43.937
You got sand on your face.

01:44.021 --> 01:45.189
-Knock 'em dead.
-Prick.

02:21.016 --> 02:22.142
What's up?

02:23.602 --> 02:26.313
Yo, Jose. My man.

02:27.397 --> 02:29.107
Fresh from the rack.

02:29.191 --> 02:30.734
What, bro? Didn't catch that.

02:30.817 --> 02:33.445
For you. Straight out of the fryer.

02:33.529 --> 02:36.448
-Are you bro-ing me some freshies?
-Yeah.

02:37.491 --> 02:40.160
Outstanding, dude.

02:40.869 --> 02:44.456
You know, I'm always saying to Bunny,
"I gotta show you what I w--

02:53.090 --> 02:55.551
I was honking for half a block.
Didn't you hear me?

02:55.634 --> 02:57.511
You scared the shit out of me, man!

02:59.721 --> 03:00.722
Man.

03:01.306 --> 03:03.433
Please just fucking shut up.

03:03.517 --> 03:06.728
Stop it. I can't think. I can't think.

03:06.812 --> 03:11.441
Please. Just shut up.
I'm trying to help you. Please.

03:12.609 --> 03:15.070
No. You're not that person anymore.

03:15.153 --> 03:18.866
You'll go home
and make something simple, satisfying.

03:18.949 --> 03:20.993
For her. For you.

03:25.789 --> 03:28.458
What's the point? You can't win.
Just fill her up. She's hungry.

03:29.793 --> 03:33.630
Fill her up, fill her up, fill her up.

03:33.714 --> 03:35.632
Here you go, sweetie. Yummy.

03:35.716 --> 03:41.138
Fill her up. Fill her up. Fill her up.

03:49.062 --> 03:51.648
It was just this one more time.

03:51.732 --> 03:55.194
They changed the rules,
so it hardly even counts.

03:55.277 --> 03:58.822
From now on, you'll be good.
You'll be better. You'll be f--

04:00.240 --> 04:01.742
Maya?

04:01.825 --> 04:04.119
Maya? Maya!

04:04.828 --> 04:07.748
Maya! Maya. You okay? What happened?

04:07.831 --> 04:09.583
What happened? Are you okay?

04:09.666 --> 04:13.045
-I can't find you. I can't find you.
-You okay? I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

04:13.128 --> 04:16.464
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

04:16.548 --> 04:17.548
You okay?

04:18.300 --> 04:21.220
I'm sorry, baby. I'm sorry.

04:24.056 --> 04:27.309
John hasn't been feeling himself lately.

04:27.976 --> 04:31.146
He's been… unpredictable.

04:31.230 --> 04:35.234
And I thought perhaps by coming here,
we might address that.

04:35.317 --> 04:36.818
Together.

04:36.902 --> 04:39.071
Oh, with the support of God
and the church.

04:39.154 --> 04:44.910
I'm very appreciative of my wife's love,
concern and godliness.

04:44.993 --> 04:48.830
I do have some stress
with regard to the future of my business.

04:48.914 --> 04:52.543
Certain things are still up in the air
at this time,

04:52.626 --> 04:55.838
but when they land,
as I expect and pray they will,

04:55.921 --> 04:59.216
I think we may find a return
to our former…

05:02.845 --> 05:04.221
predictability.

05:06.849 --> 05:11.061
Are there any other areas of concern
that you'd like to address?

05:11.144 --> 05:12.771
John has been swimming.

05:12.855 --> 05:15.983
Or trying to, at night.

05:16.066 --> 05:19.778
Water has been an irritant in the past

05:19.862 --> 05:24.366
since his father
was called back to God on that boat.

05:25.534 --> 05:28.579
-I don't know if you're aware--
-I've been a ward bishop many years.

05:28.662 --> 05:29.913
Of course.

05:32.082 --> 05:34.877
John isn't actually able to swim.

05:34.960 --> 05:37.671
Hasn't been able to since what happened.

05:37.754 --> 05:43.385
So I thought here might be
a safe place to discuss that.

05:43.468 --> 05:46.513
John, are you comfortable
having this discussion?

05:47.931 --> 05:52.019
-Of course.
-Has water been a challenge for you?

05:54.271 --> 05:58.442
It was for a while.

05:58.525 --> 06:04.072
But with prayer and discipline and,
of course, the love of my family,

06:04.156 --> 06:06.909
I've seen my way to the other side.

06:06.992 --> 06:12.956
Good. It serves little purpose
to dwell on the past.

06:15.250 --> 06:18.295
How would you characterize
your marital relations as of late?

06:20.214 --> 06:25.093
They are adequate. I believe.

06:25.177 --> 06:28.430
And yet you've only been blessed
with two children.

06:30.557 --> 06:31.767
Maria's had…

06:32.893 --> 06:35.979
a robust physical life
in other areas lately.

06:37.189 --> 06:38.106
Exercising.

06:38.190 --> 06:41.485
I don't believe that's relevant
to our marital--

06:41.568 --> 06:46.823
Excessive exertion in other areas
can put a strain on the marital bond,

06:46.907 --> 06:49.368
as well as the production of children.

06:49.451 --> 06:51.787
My question to you, Maria, is this,

06:51.870 --> 06:57.125
what more can you do to help John
during this challenging time?

06:57.626 --> 06:59.461
Four weeks, man.

06:59.545 --> 07:01.505
Four fucking weeks.

07:01.588 --> 07:03.757
That's all the time we had together.

07:03.841 --> 07:06.635
And then she's ripped from my arms,
dead on the street.

07:06.718 --> 07:09.388
-She was a surfboard, Tyler.
-She was more than that.

07:10.055 --> 07:15.394
It was some kinda, I don't know,
omen of bad things to come.

07:15.477 --> 07:16.728
We know why, babe.

07:16.812 --> 07:19.022
You've gotta go see someone
about your hearing.

07:20.440 --> 07:22.276
What the fuck?

07:23.819 --> 07:26.530
There's this doctor dude
I heard about in the water.

07:27.114 --> 07:29.700
People trust him. Apparently, he rips.

07:29.783 --> 07:31.451
Guess I could check him out.

07:37.207 --> 07:39.459
There she is. So tiny in real life.

07:41.753 --> 07:43.338
We love your tape.

07:43.422 --> 07:47.217
We've been doing it at home. Thought
we'd come check out the real thing.

07:47.301 --> 07:49.219
Is Sheila teaching today?

07:49.303 --> 07:53.223
Sheila's not teaching right now.
She's on an extended leave.

07:53.307 --> 07:55.309
I'm sorry. How'd you see our tape?

07:55.392 --> 07:59.062
Yeah. That's not really possible.
I only made, like, four copies.

08:05.485 --> 08:06.862
Who the fuck sold this to you?

08:08.447 --> 08:09.948
I've got an idea.

08:10.032 --> 08:12.492
She is quite plugged up.

08:12.576 --> 08:15.579
It's really very taxing
to hold her hand through her efforts.

08:15.662 --> 08:19.666
I recommend canned pumpkin
with a little hearty muesli…

08:19.750 --> 08:22.461
some nice plain yogurt.

08:22.544 --> 08:24.379
-Yeah. I'll try those. Yeah.
-Yeah. Okay.

08:24.463 --> 08:25.547
Thanks, Paige.

08:25.631 --> 08:26.882
-Hi.
-Go with Paige.

08:26.965 --> 08:28.383
Greta.

08:28.467 --> 08:31.970
Greta. Been a while. You dyed your hair.

08:32.054 --> 08:33.597
What can I do for you, Sheila?

08:33.679 --> 08:36.517
I just, you know,
haven't seen you or Ernie recently.

08:36.600 --> 08:38.852
You weren't at the beach cleanup.

08:38.936 --> 08:42.272
And, I know that you're angry at me.
A lot of people are.

08:42.356 --> 08:44.358
Because you're a lying, conniving untru--

08:44.441 --> 08:47.528
You're not always on my mind, you know.
I have other things going on in my life.

08:47.611 --> 08:49.905
We didn't go to the beach cleanup
because we didn't feel like it.

08:49.988 --> 08:51.323
I have to get going.

08:51.406 --> 08:52.908
Greta. I--

08:54.076 --> 08:56.620
I know I screwed up,
and I don't know how to make it right.

08:56.703 --> 08:57.704
Are you--

08:58.330 --> 09:02.209
You could start by apologizing.
You never have.

09:02.292 --> 09:03.669
What? I haven't?

09:04.670 --> 09:06.296
Really? I mean, I meant to.

09:06.380 --> 09:09.049
I thought--

09:09.132 --> 09:12.594
I should have, because I am sorry.

09:12.678 --> 09:14.513
I'm so sorry. It was a mistake.

09:14.596 --> 09:17.057
It was just a stupid, selfish--

09:17.140 --> 09:20.519
All you had to do was ask.
I would've let you borrow the camera.

09:21.895 --> 09:22.896
Really?

09:24.439 --> 09:25.649
You're my friend.

09:31.154 --> 09:32.531
I real-- I--

09:33.365 --> 09:35.742
I have a really hard time
opening up to other women.

09:37.244 --> 09:40.414
Yeah, well, I'm too good at it.

09:40.497 --> 09:42.499
And it makes people uncomfortable. So…

09:43.458 --> 09:45.335
opposite problems, same result.

09:49.256 --> 09:51.884
Oh, my God. Can I just show you something?

09:51.967 --> 09:53.093
Yeah.

09:57.181 --> 09:58.557
Oh, my God.

09:59.558 --> 10:01.018
Shut up.

10:01.101 --> 10:03.520
-What happened?
-I got inspired.

10:03.604 --> 10:05.105
Wow. By the tape?

10:05.189 --> 10:09.026
No. Not at first. I mean, at first,
I was, like, super scared.

10:09.109 --> 10:12.237
Like, who is this stranger I have been
sleeping next to all these years, right?

10:12.321 --> 10:15.949
But then we talked about,
like, who we really are,

10:16.033 --> 10:18.493
and what we really like.

10:19.244 --> 10:21.914
Like, do you know that he loves my belly?

10:22.956 --> 10:24.291
The fullness?

10:24.374 --> 10:28.712
It's so funny. The thing I've been beating
myself up over for years, he loves.

10:31.965 --> 10:35.511
I gotta put this rug back on.
I look crazy.

10:36.053 --> 10:37.471
You look amazing.

10:37.554 --> 10:39.723
-Yeah?
-Yeah. It's so cool.

10:39.806 --> 10:41.391
It's--

10:41.975 --> 10:43.018
It's a swing.

10:43.101 --> 10:44.520
I'm a little scared of you.

10:50.484 --> 10:52.027
You better get out that door.

11:20.347 --> 11:24.142
Bishop Alec was right.
I wasn't doing enough for you.

11:24.226 --> 11:28.438
So I thought long and hard to figure out
what you needed that I wasn't giving.

11:29.231 --> 11:30.983
Now you can work on your water challenges

11:31.066 --> 11:33.360
from the sanctity
of our own blessed bedroom.

11:34.152 --> 11:35.487
Isn't that wonderful?

11:37.739 --> 11:40.158
It is a waste of time.

11:40.242 --> 11:41.785
They'd never give me the endorsement

11:41.869 --> 11:43.954
even if I got 'em all sucked off
by Nancy Reagan.

11:44.037 --> 11:45.038
Don't say anything.

11:45.122 --> 11:46.915
-You're right, man.
-Yes. I am.

11:46.999 --> 11:48.500
But you still gotta go.

11:48.584 --> 11:52.629
It's the Chamber of Commerce
we're talking about. It's precedent.

11:52.713 --> 11:56.175
Precedent? Precedent has meant
selling out our community

11:56.258 --> 11:58.802
and our coastline
to enrich fraudulent assholes.

11:58.886 --> 12:01.972
Don't say anything.

12:02.055 --> 12:03.056
Just go.

12:03.140 --> 12:08.145
Eat their food, shake their fat
fucking fingers, and stick to your guns.

12:08.228 --> 12:10.981
No coastal development.

12:11.064 --> 12:11.899
Don't…

12:11.982 --> 12:14.651
Don't you want the pleasure
of saying that to their face?

12:14.735 --> 12:15.569
…say…

12:15.652 --> 12:17.529
Personally, I'd rather see that.

12:17.613 --> 12:19.406
You're wrong.

12:19.489 --> 12:21.575
I know these guys aren't our allies,

12:21.658 --> 12:24.995
but you can't purposefully alienate them.
This is San Diego.

12:25.078 --> 12:29.833
We'll never get the fundamentalists,
the anti-communists, the naval block.

12:29.917 --> 12:33.712
And your own coalition
is surfers, students.

12:33.795 --> 12:36.340
They're more likely to
forget their own birthday than vote.

12:37.466 --> 12:40.385
We can't afford to estrange ourselves
from the business community as well.

12:40.469 --> 12:43.222
Especially since the middle ground
is so accessible.

12:43.805 --> 12:47.851
You're not against all coastal
development, you're for smart development.

12:50.687 --> 12:51.939
You got this.

12:58.237 --> 13:00.239
I don't remember asking you
for your input.

13:01.448 --> 13:04.618
What I remember is you burying us in debt,

13:04.701 --> 13:08.205
endangering our campaign
and our livelihood,

13:09.248 --> 13:11.250
lying to me.

13:13.252 --> 13:15.838
So, Sheila,

13:17.339 --> 13:19.466
how do I trust anything you say now?

13:19.550 --> 13:22.177
You had to open your big, fat fucking--

13:22.261 --> 13:23.470
I'm sorry.

13:24.555 --> 13:27.683
I was out of line. You're right.

13:31.770 --> 13:33.605
I'm telling you, dude. It's not her.

13:33.689 --> 13:35.482
Sup, Sheila. How you been?

13:36.525 --> 13:39.069
What? We're not doing small talk first?
It's a social convention.

13:39.152 --> 13:42.114
Someone's selling our video
with a different cover all over town.

13:42.197 --> 13:45.951
So the way we see it, you're either
a fucking flake or a fucking thief.

13:46.034 --> 13:47.035
Which one is it?

13:47.119 --> 13:49.997
I mean, are you a fat bitch now?

13:50.080 --> 13:53.876
Or are you just a fat bitch
because fat, ugly, fat? Bitch?

13:54.543 --> 13:55.419
Fat?

13:57.713 --> 13:59.715
I have no idea
what happened with the video.

13:59.798 --> 14:01.258
The whole thing's just a dream.

14:01.341 --> 14:04.469
A nightmare, really,
but I can't be involved anymore. I--

14:04.553 --> 14:09.766
Wait, you're, like, already involved.
I mean, it's your face on the tape. Look.

14:10.267 --> 14:13.854
I am not involved anymore.

14:13.937 --> 14:15.105
I'm done with all of it, okay?

14:15.189 --> 14:19.193
I just have to support my husband
and my family, and that is it. I'm sorry.

14:22.321 --> 14:23.488
What was that about?

14:24.948 --> 14:27.075
Nothing, babe. Nothing.

15:50.993 --> 15:53.787
Advanced case of surfer's ear.

15:54.329 --> 15:57.291
Which is a pretty hefty bummer
for a dude as young as you.

15:58.792 --> 16:01.795
So what does that mean?

16:01.879 --> 16:05.465
It means you have bone growth
in your ear canal

16:05.549 --> 16:09.386
from constant exposure
to cold water and wind.

16:09.469 --> 16:11.555
Aka, surfing the Pacific.

16:11.638 --> 16:12.723
Gnarly.

16:12.806 --> 16:14.141
Couple options:

16:14.224 --> 16:19.104
You could cross your fingers
and plug your ears when you surf,

16:19.188 --> 16:22.524
but there's a pretty good chance
you'd have permanent hearing loss.

16:22.608 --> 16:24.401
Yeah, I can live with that.

16:24.484 --> 16:28.322
Or die from getting an infection
after a rainstorm

16:28.405 --> 16:31.950
when all that beautiful sewage hits.
God bless America.

16:32.034 --> 16:33.202
Or?

16:33.285 --> 16:35.120
We could do a procedure.

16:35.204 --> 16:37.247
Drill into the ear,

16:37.331 --> 16:40.792
and then you have to stay out of the water
for two months post-op.

16:40.876 --> 16:43.420
-Two months?
-I know. It's brutal.

16:43.921 --> 16:48.800
But, while nothing
is confirmed about the afterlife,

16:48.884 --> 16:50.928
I'm not sure you can surf there either.

16:54.973 --> 16:55.974
Fuck.

16:56.058 --> 16:59.269
You're gonna give 'em hell.
They won't know what hit 'em, man.

16:59.353 --> 17:01.939
Let them know what they're up against,
that they can't mess with you.

17:02.022 --> 17:05.025
Or you could make an unexpected
connection, change a mind or two,

17:05.108 --> 17:07.152
especially if you talk about
smart growth and development.

17:07.236 --> 17:09.988
-No, he's not doing that.
-I think it's up to him, Jerry. Not you.

17:10.071 --> 17:11.823
There's Ernie right there.

17:11.906 --> 17:13.242
Wait. Who's that with him?

17:13.325 --> 17:15.035
I don't know,
but he definitely has a type.

17:15.117 --> 17:16.453
That's Greta. It's his wife.

17:16.537 --> 17:17.871
-Greta!
-Hey.

17:17.954 --> 17:20.249
-Hey. Hi.
-Been a while. Good to see you.

17:20.332 --> 17:22.416
-You remember Jerry Goldman?
-Oh, yeah. Hey, Jerry.

17:22.501 --> 17:23.710
-Campaign manager.
-Hey, how you doing?

17:23.794 --> 17:25.087
-This is Ernie and Greta Hauser.
-Hi.

17:25.170 --> 17:26.797
-I like your hair.
-Thank you.

17:26.880 --> 17:29.174
-We've missed you guys.
-Yeah, we…

17:29.258 --> 17:31.844
we've been a little busy.

17:31.927 --> 17:34.763
Yeah. But we very much
enjoyed watching your campaign grow.

17:34.847 --> 17:37.266
-From the sidelines. Yeah.
-Well, the important thing

17:37.349 --> 17:38.559
is that you're here now.

17:38.642 --> 17:40.769
We thank you so much for your support.
Especially today.

17:40.853 --> 17:42.771
Yeah. Absolutely.
Especially in this crowd.

17:42.855 --> 17:46.650
I haven't felt this out of place since
the first time I met Sheila's parents,

17:46.733 --> 17:50.070
which was also the last time,
so that's how well it went. Yeah.

17:52.197 --> 17:56.201
Well, don't worry. This group is…
It's already well fortified.

17:56.285 --> 17:57.828
Just keep the syllable count low.

18:04.585 --> 18:05.669
Sup.

18:06.461 --> 18:07.838
Sup.

18:07.921 --> 18:09.840
It's going off. You paddling out?

18:10.507 --> 18:11.425
Can't.

18:11.508 --> 18:14.178
Got this ear thing. It's serious.

18:14.261 --> 18:16.513
Doctor says it could be my fucking fune.

18:17.347 --> 18:19.766
Plus, my new board broke.

18:20.350 --> 18:23.520
And a man I believed to be my friend
stole my video and bootlegged it,

18:23.604 --> 18:26.190
so I'm feeling pretty fucking
all around screwed, dude.

18:27.608 --> 18:28.692
'Kay.

18:29.276 --> 18:30.277
Later.

18:31.486 --> 18:32.821
Hey, wait.

18:34.489 --> 18:35.657
It's really going off?

18:51.757 --> 18:53.133
Not bad, huh?

18:56.637 --> 18:57.804
I guess.

18:57.888 --> 18:59.389
Your tape. Your workout.

19:00.557 --> 19:01.600
I saw it.

19:02.434 --> 19:04.102
My wife, she does it.

19:04.728 --> 19:05.854
Is doing it.

19:06.980 --> 19:09.024
She likes it, and I understand why.

19:09.107 --> 19:10.317
Thank you.

19:10.400 --> 19:14.863
I'm curious, though, as a businessman.
What's your distribution model?

19:14.947 --> 19:16.365
Like, how do you plan to grow?

19:17.824 --> 19:19.535
-What's next, Sheila?
-Nothing.

19:19.618 --> 19:22.246
-Nothing is next.
-What do you mean nothing?

19:22.829 --> 19:24.414
The video was a mistake. A folly.

19:24.498 --> 19:28.210
You know, something that I just fell into
but then reconsidered.

19:28.794 --> 19:32.256
I've never seen anything like it.
Outside of the church, that is.

19:32.339 --> 19:36.468
The fervor that you bring
to teaching, it's--

19:36.552 --> 19:40.180
My wife is certainly taken by it.
I think other women would be too.

19:41.306 --> 19:44.601
And with the VCR home market
just beginning,

19:44.685 --> 19:46.603
you could be sitting on a gold mine.

19:46.687 --> 19:49.189
-Well, that wasn't my goal.
-But it was your instinct.

19:49.273 --> 19:52.401
The woman I saw on that tape wouldn't
be happy standing next to her husband,

19:52.484 --> 19:54.695
peddling a bunch of old 1960's socialism--

19:54.778 --> 19:58.073
You don't know who I am,
and you're just seeing what you wanna see.

19:58.156 --> 20:01.285
And Danny's politics aren't old.
They're timeless and visionary.

20:02.160 --> 20:03.161
Sure.

20:04.162 --> 20:06.915
My apologies.
I thought I saw something else.

20:08.584 --> 20:09.877
Something more…

20:11.545 --> 20:13.338
-Never mind.
-You like to do that.

20:13.422 --> 20:16.341
Like, half say something
and then walk away.

20:18.635 --> 20:19.636
Okay.

20:21.013 --> 20:22.764
I saw a future for you
that looks a lot different

20:22.848 --> 20:24.349
than the one your husband's laying out.

20:24.433 --> 20:26.018
I believe what my husband believes.

20:26.101 --> 20:28.770
Yeah, but isn't it strange,
how you can believe one thing

20:28.854 --> 20:30.647
and still be drawn to something else?

20:33.150 --> 20:35.027
There's a market for your tape.

20:35.110 --> 20:37.362
If you don't take advantage of it,
someone else will.

20:37.446 --> 20:39.031
Somebody already has.

20:39.114 --> 20:41.742
Someone's apparently bootlegging it
and selling it themselves.

20:41.825 --> 20:43.827
What? You're just letting them
get away with it? Why?

20:43.911 --> 20:45.662
Because you're pathetic.
A worthless sack of shit.

20:45.746 --> 20:48.081
Because I have other priorities.

20:48.165 --> 20:50.334
Hey, they're getting ready to start.
I saved you a seat.

20:51.251 --> 20:52.085
Excuse me.

20:52.169 --> 20:53.170
Not at all.

20:54.129 --> 20:55.464
Nice to see you.

20:57.466 --> 20:58.675
Is everything all right?

20:58.759 --> 21:00.511
For once in your fucking life, the truth.

21:00.594 --> 21:03.305
No. It's actually-- It's not.
Will you drive me somewhere?

21:03.889 --> 21:04.973
Tyler.

21:08.101 --> 21:13.023
Tyler? I got burritos.
If you can't surf, at least you can eat.

21:13.649 --> 21:16.026
If you want someone for growth,

21:16.109 --> 21:20.364
for prosperity, progress,

21:20.447 --> 21:21.990
then you want me.

21:22.074 --> 21:25.452
Not some tax-and-spend,
flip-flopping liberal

21:25.536 --> 21:27.371
who thinks he can
shave his beard once a year

21:27.454 --> 21:30.249
and convince you he's not who he is.

21:30.332 --> 21:31.333
Idiot.

21:31.416 --> 21:34.086
My opponent does have one thing right.

21:34.169 --> 21:36.213
I do wanna protect our coastline

21:36.296 --> 21:40.676
to continue the great legacy
of the California Coastal Act

21:40.759 --> 21:43.595
so that we can all keep enjoying
our beautiful beaches.

21:44.930 --> 21:48.267
But I would never impede progress.

21:49.226 --> 21:54.022
I don't wanna diminish
our business community.

21:54.773 --> 21:58.861
And that is why I am for
smart coastal development.

22:02.030 --> 22:03.073
Yes.

22:04.324 --> 22:07.536
What the fuck, dude? Don't do this.

22:07.619 --> 22:11.373
Maybe it will help you understand
what we're dealing with!

22:11.456 --> 22:14.751
I'm sorry.
I couldn't stop myself from surfing.

22:14.835 --> 22:16.461
It was physically impossible.

22:18.422 --> 22:20.757
Don't do it. Please, Bun.

22:20.841 --> 22:23.051
That concert shirt is a collector's item.

22:23.135 --> 22:24.720
Then promise you'll stop.

22:26.013 --> 22:27.764
I can't have you fucking dying on me.

22:34.521 --> 22:38.400
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I fucked
everything up. I fucked it all up.

22:38.483 --> 22:41.987
I disappeared, I said
I was done with aerobics, with you.

22:42.070 --> 22:44.740
But I-- Aerobics saved me.

22:46.825 --> 22:48.243
You saved me.

22:48.785 --> 22:53.123
I wanna find whoever's bootlegging
our tape and take back what's ours.

22:55.334 --> 22:57.586
You're fucking bananas. You know that?

22:57.669 --> 23:00.297
I know! But so are you.

23:23.862 --> 23:25.405
You have a choice.

23:25.489 --> 23:29.243
You either give us our tapes,
our money, our contacts,

23:29.326 --> 23:31.495
or you go to jail
for stealing our copyright.

23:31.578 --> 23:34.081
My husband is a close personal friend
of the DA,

23:34.164 --> 23:37.835
and I'm happy to call him
on his home phone.

23:39.378 --> 23:43.590
Look, my family's actually really
influential in the community as well,

23:43.674 --> 23:47.052
so I'm not exactly scared over here.

23:50.722 --> 23:52.975
What are you doing?

23:56.770 --> 23:58.397
Give me my fucking tapes.

24:09.032 --> 24:10.033
Where's the money?

24:30.429 --> 24:32.306
You don't dislike it, do you?

24:35.100 --> 24:37.644
No. Not a bit.

24:57.831 --> 25:00.083
I gotta tell you,
there's just no pleasing my wife.

25:00.167 --> 25:04.421
I take her advice,
and she still abandons me

25:04.505 --> 25:07.382
without a word, like I'm nothing.

25:09.426 --> 25:10.677
Thank you.

25:10.761 --> 25:12.095
You know, I don't know, Simone.

25:12.179 --> 25:15.974
I love her, but sometimes I wonder
if I really even know her at all.

25:16.725 --> 25:20.562
Does Sheila maybe have,
like, a food thing?

25:21.104 --> 25:22.356
What food thing?

25:23.398 --> 25:25.275
My sophomore roommate,

25:25.359 --> 25:29.112
she used to eat in these huge binges,

25:29.196 --> 25:33.075
and she had these,
like, bite marks on her knuckles

25:33.158 --> 25:35.160
from making herself throw up afterwards.

25:35.244 --> 25:37.287
-Okay.
-Kind of, like, cuts.

25:39.706 --> 25:41.333
Sheila has them too.

25:42.793 --> 25:46.547
She watches her figure, sure.
But no more than any other woman.

25:49.967 --> 25:52.344
I don't know. She--
Her body's always been so foreign to her.

25:52.427 --> 25:55.097
Like, she can't ever just enjoy herself.

25:55.180 --> 25:56.974
I mean, even when we're…

25:59.393 --> 26:02.646
You know. She's, like, half there.

26:02.729 --> 26:04.314
Lots of us are half there.

26:04.982 --> 26:06.191
Not you.

26:07.568 --> 26:10.737
-I have been.
-No. No, no. No way.

26:12.489 --> 26:13.657
You are…

26:15.284 --> 26:16.535
self-possessed.

26:16.618 --> 26:23.333
You are unapologetically sexual.
And it is…

26:24.960 --> 26:26.420
it's intoxicating.

26:46.148 --> 26:48.150
I just want you to enjoy yourself.

26:52.696 --> 26:55.908
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

27:17.304 --> 27:20.140
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Danny, your kid! Danny!

27:20.224 --> 27:22.434
What? Hey. Hey, sweetie.

27:23.101 --> 27:25.812
It's still sleepy time right now.

27:25.896 --> 27:27.856
So you wanna go back to bed?

27:36.532 --> 27:37.616
Yeah!

27:43.497 --> 27:46.250
I can't hide anymore. I don't want to.

27:48.335 --> 27:51.547
This is a part of me,
and it's not going away.

28:11.441 --> 28:13.193
What the hell is all this?

28:17.197 --> 28:18.740
This is how we win.
