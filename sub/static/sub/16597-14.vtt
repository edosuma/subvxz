WEBVTT

00:04.972 --> 00:06.607
Clark, did I forget
your birthday again?

00:06.640 --> 00:08.276
Yes,
but it's not today.

00:09.543 --> 00:11.312
This is Connor's
Valentine's Day gift.

00:11.345 --> 00:13.414
I am creating a romantic
scavenger hunt

00:13.447 --> 00:15.049
that's going
to lead him to it.

00:15.083 --> 00:17.351
Man, Valentine's Day
sure sneaks up on you.

00:17.385 --> 00:19.019
We always end up
going out to eat

00:19.053 --> 00:20.821
wherever I can score
a last-minute res.

00:20.854 --> 00:22.623
I mean, not lazy,
spontaneous.

00:22.656 --> 00:25.159
You know, it's part
of the Ken Park package.

00:25.193 --> 00:28.028
I just flat-out told Eric
what I wanted tonight...

00:28.062 --> 00:29.697
a nice, romantic steak.

00:29.730 --> 00:33.434
Oh, where are you gonna go,
Meat is Murder over on Pico?

00:33.467 --> 00:36.370
No. It's this place that Pat
and I found by the airport.

00:36.404 --> 00:37.705
It is delicious.

00:37.738 --> 00:39.273
It's a little loud,

00:39.307 --> 00:41.242
but I've heard all of
Eric's stories anyway.

00:41.275 --> 00:42.543
(PHONE RINGING)

00:43.377 --> 00:46.046
Oh, Allison,
she needs me.

00:46.080 --> 00:47.815
Already misses this.

00:49.983 --> 00:52.253
So, you picked a place
that you and Pat used to go?

00:52.286 --> 00:53.887
How is Eric gonna feel
about that?

00:53.921 --> 00:55.223
Ah, he's probably
gonna feel like

00:55.256 --> 00:56.924
he doesn't know
Pat and I dated.

00:56.957 --> 00:58.559
(GASPS)

00:58.592 --> 01:00.060
What?
You haven't told him?

01:00.094 --> 01:02.863
I was going to,
but then...

01:02.896 --> 01:04.232
I didn't.

01:05.866 --> 01:07.701
And here we are,
three months later,

01:07.735 --> 01:10.070
and he seems
cool with it.

01:11.739 --> 01:13.107
Excuse me.

01:13.141 --> 01:14.708
Megan Vogel
to see Dr. Tuttle.

01:14.742 --> 01:15.809
Oh, he'll be down
in a minute.

01:15.843 --> 01:17.578
You can just wait
right over there.
Thank you.

01:24.318 --> 01:25.353
Psst!

01:25.386 --> 01:26.587
Do you know
who that is?

01:26.620 --> 01:29.190
Well, she's got a rolling
suitcase in a hospital.

01:29.223 --> 01:30.891
So she's either
a pharmaceutical rep,

01:30.924 --> 01:32.593
or she got very lost

01:32.626 --> 01:34.262
looking for her
connecting flight.

01:34.295 --> 01:36.597
No, that's Megan,

01:36.630 --> 01:38.266
the woman I met
at that jazz festival

01:38.299 --> 01:40.634
when I was pretending
that Ken's kid was
my adopted Asian son.

01:40.668 --> 01:43.604
Why in the hell
would you do that?

01:43.637 --> 01:46.073
Because she also has
an adopted Asian child.

01:46.106 --> 01:48.876
Just trust me, it was the
right thing to do at the time.

01:48.909 --> 01:50.144
Well, it turns out
it wasn't,

01:50.178 --> 01:52.746
'cause she got bent
outta shape when
I told her the truth.

01:52.780 --> 01:54.415
(SIGHS) It's too bad,
'cause I really liked her.

01:54.448 --> 01:56.049
Then just go apologize.

01:56.083 --> 01:58.252
Maybe the universe
is giving you a second chance.

02:00.921 --> 02:03.291
Or her a second chance
to spit in his face.

02:03.324 --> 02:04.392
Ugh!

02:15.002 --> 02:17.137
I'll be right there
to make that
important decision!

02:17.171 --> 02:18.339
Pat?

02:18.372 --> 02:20.541
Oh, hey, it's you!

02:20.574 --> 02:22.543
Megan.
Megan, yes, Megan.

02:22.576 --> 02:23.677
I'm gonna wait
outside.

02:23.711 --> 02:25.979
Oh, no, no, no,
Megan, uh...

02:26.747 --> 02:28.482
I'm sorry.

02:28.516 --> 02:30.284
I let you think
that Dave was my kid

02:30.318 --> 02:32.520
'cause it seemed
to make you like me,

02:32.553 --> 02:34.555
but if it'll
make things better,

02:34.588 --> 02:36.790
I, I could adopt
a child for real.

02:38.392 --> 02:40.160
Or I could take you
to dinner tonight.

02:40.194 --> 02:41.562
It's Valentine's Day.

02:41.595 --> 02:42.896
Right.

02:43.897 --> 02:45.199
I don't have any plans,

02:45.233 --> 02:47.601
but I did optimistically
book a sitter.

02:47.635 --> 02:50.504
Oh, well, I did optimistically
make a reservation,

02:50.538 --> 02:52.373
and I'm sure it wouldn't be
too much trouble

02:52.406 --> 02:54.942
to bump it up
from one person to two.

02:55.843 --> 02:57.044
Okay.

02:57.077 --> 02:58.178
BOTH: Aww!

03:01.148 --> 03:03.384
No, Allison, if you don't
wanna do anything tonight,

03:03.417 --> 03:04.952
that's totally fine.

03:07.588 --> 03:10.491
No, I'll get over it.
Love you.

03:10.524 --> 03:12.226
She doesn't
wanna do anything!

03:12.260 --> 03:14.628
She just wants to watch TV
in sweatpants.

03:14.662 --> 03:16.697
You know,
sometimes good things

03:16.730 --> 03:18.499
do happen
to good people.

03:19.267 --> 03:20.834
Well, if you're
staying in,

03:20.868 --> 03:23.170
then you can hide the present
for my scavenger hunt

03:23.203 --> 03:25.138
at the sculpture garden
by your house.

03:25.172 --> 03:27.308
It's where Connor and I
went on our first date.

03:27.341 --> 03:28.409
BOTH: Aww!

03:28.442 --> 03:29.543
(LAUGHS)

03:29.577 --> 03:31.612
Anything for you, Clark.
Is it fragile?

03:31.645 --> 03:34.014
Because I might just toss it
from the car.

03:40.588 --> 03:42.189
Oh, what's happening
in here?

03:42.222 --> 03:43.223
Magic!

03:44.425 --> 03:47.160
I'm making Valentine's Day
dinner for me and Emily.

03:47.194 --> 03:49.597
Korean galbi,
tteok in a red chili sauce,

03:49.630 --> 03:50.664
and creme brulee.

03:51.932 --> 03:53.434
(CLEARS THROAT)

03:53.467 --> 03:54.835
Grandpa's my sous-chef

03:54.868 --> 03:59.607
since I'm not
allowed to use the
creme brulee torch anymore.

03:59.640 --> 04:03.110
Even though my eyebrows
grew back thicker than before!

04:06.280 --> 04:09.016
Wow, buddy.
First Valentine's Day.

04:09.049 --> 04:10.318
So sweet.

04:10.351 --> 04:12.853
My first one with your dad
was pretty perfect.

04:12.886 --> 04:15.856
Picnic on the beach,
classic.

04:15.889 --> 04:17.057
But he forgot
the picnic,

04:17.090 --> 04:19.527
so we shared a warm,
flat Coke he had
in his car.

04:21.261 --> 04:22.863
Classic Coke.

04:24.498 --> 04:27.100
It was very Ken,
but romantic.

04:28.001 --> 04:29.870
Well, not as romantic
as tonight,

04:29.903 --> 04:33.741
sweatpants and this
mid-range Chardonnay

04:33.774 --> 04:36.744
a patient gave me
for freezing off
his skin tags.

04:38.412 --> 04:39.880
D.K., why aren't you
with Linda?

04:39.913 --> 04:41.081
We broke up again.

04:41.114 --> 04:44.284
Well, I can't think
of anything I wanna
hear less about.

04:44.318 --> 04:46.920
It's like,
"Save the drama
for your mama!"

04:55.128 --> 04:56.564
Happy Valentine's Day,
baby!

04:56.597 --> 04:57.665
I did everything
you asked,

04:57.698 --> 05:00.634
down to wearing
the outfit that you
laid out for me.

05:00.668 --> 05:04.372
That was a pile of your stuff
that I was donating
to Goodwill.

05:04.405 --> 05:06.173
Well, you win some,
you lose some.

05:07.240 --> 05:09.510
Mm, it's Pat!

05:11.178 --> 05:12.480
Aw, geez.

05:15.182 --> 05:17.385
Well, well, well,
what a surprise!

05:17.418 --> 05:18.819
Yeah.

05:18.852 --> 05:20.788
Here you are on a date,
I'm on a date.

05:22.423 --> 05:23.624
So, how's your date going?

05:23.657 --> 05:24.992
Good.
Good?

05:26.126 --> 05:30.163
Good!
Oh, well, mine is going
gangbusters,

05:30.197 --> 05:31.765
you know,
despite our rocky start,

05:31.799 --> 05:34.402
so I guess a relationship
can be built on a lie.

05:36.236 --> 05:38.105
Oh, well,
enjoy your dinner.

05:40.273 --> 05:41.942
Your boss
is a weird guy.

05:41.975 --> 05:44.244
Is he? I don't really
know him that well.

05:45.178 --> 05:46.647
I'm just gonna run
to the ladies' room,

05:46.680 --> 05:49.249
but don't worry,
I'm totally coming back.

05:50.083 --> 05:51.251
(LAUGHS)

05:55.088 --> 05:56.189
Ah...

06:01.128 --> 06:03.664
I'm gonna take a bath
and have another
glass of wine.

06:03.697 --> 06:06.066
Why not?
We ain't drivin' nowhere.

06:06.099 --> 06:07.167
(LAUGHS)

06:09.169 --> 06:10.871
Hey, buddy,
what's up?

06:10.904 --> 06:12.740
I need a little help
with Emily's gift.

06:12.773 --> 06:15.943
It's a poem.
I'd like to scan it
for posterity.

06:15.976 --> 06:18.579
A poem, huh?

06:18.612 --> 06:20.881
"You're beautiful,
ravine mane

06:20.914 --> 06:24.084
"is only rivaled
by your impressive brain."

06:24.117 --> 06:25.185
Hmm.

06:25.218 --> 06:28.756
"Your passion for NPR
makes my heart sing.

06:28.789 --> 06:32.225
"I collect it like a vase
from the Ming.

06:33.861 --> 06:35.563
"You have been sent
from Heaven above,

06:35.596 --> 06:39.199
"which is why I'm giving you
the gift of my love,

06:39.232 --> 06:42.135
"because eternal love
is eternal love

06:42.169 --> 06:43.871
"is eternal love."

06:43.904 --> 06:45.405
That's just
the first stanza.

06:45.439 --> 06:47.274
What do you think?

06:47.307 --> 06:48.876
Well, do you like having
a girlfriend?

06:48.909 --> 06:50.778
Yeah.
Then lose the poem.

06:52.546 --> 06:55.048
Eternal love
is eternal love...

06:55.649 --> 06:57.585
It's a little too much.

06:57.618 --> 06:59.086
Okay, I feel you.

06:59.119 --> 07:00.287
I'll go with plan "B".

07:00.320 --> 07:01.989
Stickers of our
founding fathers.

07:02.022 --> 07:03.390
(CHUCKLES)

07:04.592 --> 07:05.659
Hoo!

07:10.798 --> 07:12.700
Oh, hey, Jae.
Hey, Dr. Park.

07:12.733 --> 07:13.934
Aren't you guys
going out?

07:13.967 --> 07:15.769
No, we're just gonna
Netflix.

07:15.803 --> 07:17.805
You know it's
Valentine's Day, right?

07:17.838 --> 07:19.039
(LAUGHING)

07:21.174 --> 07:23.410
Sorry. Valentine's Day's
a corporate holiday.

07:23.443 --> 07:25.646
Yeah, it's just like any other
day to people who don't buy

07:25.679 --> 07:27.715
what big business is cramming
down their throats.

07:28.281 --> 07:30.383
Oh, okay.

07:30.417 --> 07:32.686
I guess I've just been
a lemming all these years.

07:32.720 --> 07:34.387
A lot of people are,
don't sweat it.

07:34.955 --> 07:36.056
Thanks.

07:36.089 --> 07:37.157
(DOORBELL RINGS)

07:42.195 --> 07:45.699
Oh! I told Ken
not to do anything.

07:46.934 --> 07:49.202
Uh, don't worry.
He didn't do anything.

07:50.771 --> 07:52.906
It's funny how your arthritis
starts acting up

07:52.940 --> 07:54.908
just when I ask you
to julienne the vegetables!

07:56.944 --> 07:58.045
Flowers
for Dave Park?

07:58.078 --> 07:59.346
Yep.

07:59.379 --> 08:00.714
In fairness,
it does sound like

08:00.748 --> 08:02.349
you told him
not to do anything.

08:02.382 --> 08:03.517
I know what I said.

08:07.287 --> 08:09.122
I saved up my allowance
to buy these for Emily

08:09.156 --> 08:11.158
because she's as sweet
as a dozen roses.

08:11.592 --> 08:13.293
Aww.

08:13.326 --> 08:15.529
Tomorrow, you can buy those
same flowers for half price.

08:15.563 --> 08:17.397
But they won't
mean as much then.

08:17.430 --> 08:18.566
Says who?

08:19.299 --> 08:20.768
Says...

08:20.801 --> 08:22.402
a lot of people.

08:23.503 --> 08:24.938
Emily will love them.

08:25.606 --> 08:27.541
Anybody would love them.

08:29.743 --> 08:31.278
Things are too quiet
in the kitchen.

08:31.311 --> 08:32.646
I should get back.

08:37.284 --> 08:38.451
Take 'em.

08:42.522 --> 08:43.957
(SIGHS)

08:43.991 --> 08:46.159
Guess I'll just get into
my really comfortable sweats.

08:46.794 --> 08:48.261
Those aren't them?

08:49.196 --> 08:50.698
I'm not enjoying you
right now.

08:57.838 --> 08:59.573
(SIGHS)
What's wrong?

08:59.607 --> 09:02.209
Pat's date still hasn't come
back from the ladies' room.

09:02.876 --> 09:04.011
You think she left?

09:04.044 --> 09:06.580
I mean, it's Pat,
so probably.

09:08.381 --> 09:09.850
Aw, man.
That is sad.

09:11.084 --> 09:12.786
Oh, that is even sadder.

09:18.726 --> 09:19.727
Oh...

09:20.961 --> 09:23.196
Seems my date wasn't going
quite as well as I thought.

09:24.832 --> 09:25.966
That's okay.

09:25.999 --> 09:28.602
Soon, I'll be in bed
eating steak for two.

09:30.037 --> 09:31.438
Well, it's good
to see you, Pat.

09:31.471 --> 09:33.040
Yeah, you, too.
Okay.

09:33.073 --> 09:34.274
Hey, look, Pat,
why don't you join us?

09:34.307 --> 09:36.009
Oh, I couldn't.

09:51.725 --> 09:52.860
Oh!

09:54.094 --> 09:56.930
Allison, do my hands look
prune-ier than usual?

09:58.999 --> 10:00.100
You okay?

10:01.134 --> 10:02.202
I am now.

10:03.536 --> 10:05.939
Even though I said
I didn't want
anything special,

10:05.973 --> 10:07.407
you knew deep down
I did.

10:07.440 --> 10:09.109
What you wrote
is beautiful.

10:09.142 --> 10:11.344
I love the part
about NPR.

10:12.680 --> 10:14.347
And you used some
big words in here

10:14.381 --> 10:15.783
I didn't even know
you knew!

10:22.790 --> 10:24.457
Okay, the clue says,

10:24.491 --> 10:27.995
"You had no idea
what the night had in store,

10:28.028 --> 10:29.730
"but under this hunk

"is the gift
you're looking for."

10:32.199 --> 10:34.968
Is it under you?
Ooh! (CHUCKLES)

10:35.869 --> 10:37.404
This is so much fun!

10:37.437 --> 10:39.673
I never want
the scavenger hunt to end.

10:39.707 --> 10:40.908
Okay.

10:44.912 --> 10:46.213
Maybe this isn't
the end.

10:50.918 --> 10:52.252
Ken.

10:55.055 --> 10:56.589
Keep looking.
There aren't many
other places...

10:56.623 --> 10:57.858
(SCREAMING)
Just do it!

11:02.229 --> 11:04.097
I really am sorry
your date left.

11:04.131 --> 11:06.867
Ah, it's nothing
a delicious steak can't fix.

11:06.900 --> 11:09.036
Mm.

11:09.069 --> 11:10.904
Hey, did Damona tell you
how we discovered
this place?

11:10.938 --> 11:11.972
Unh-unh!

11:13.440 --> 11:14.908
I'm sorry,
did you wanna
tell the story?

11:14.942 --> 11:16.076
Unh-unh!

11:17.244 --> 11:20.047
You discovered it together,
like, just the two of you?

11:20.080 --> 11:21.181
Mm-hmm.
It was
a work thing.

11:21.214 --> 11:22.682
Mm?

11:22.716 --> 11:24.952
Yeah, yeah.
Oh, yeah.

11:24.985 --> 11:26.519
Yeah,
it was a work thing.

11:26.553 --> 11:29.022
Yeah, 'cause we're, uh,
we're co-workers...

11:29.056 --> 11:30.157
who dated.

11:32.559 --> 11:33.727
You two dated?

11:33.761 --> 11:35.763
Uh, sort of,

11:35.796 --> 11:38.165
but nothing serious
or anything. (LAUGHS)

11:38.198 --> 11:41.134
No, no, no, no,
nothing serious, no.

11:41.168 --> 11:43.303
It was just
two grown adults
having a little...

11:43.336 --> 11:45.973
Well, sometimes
a whole lot of fun.

11:50.343 --> 11:51.812
Why didn't you tell me
about this before?

11:51.845 --> 11:53.546
Yeah, why didn't I?

11:54.547 --> 11:56.917
We would all like
to know the answer.

11:56.950 --> 11:59.452
Let me see
if I can go find one
in the ladies' room.

12:04.157 --> 12:06.894
Well, this isn't exactly
the Valentine's Day
I was picturing.

12:06.927 --> 12:08.095
Really?

12:08.128 --> 12:11.031
Yeah, in the realm of all
possible Valentine's Days,

12:11.064 --> 12:12.933
this did occur to me.

12:17.905 --> 12:19.139
Where's Jae?

12:19.172 --> 12:21.574
His friends
were seeing a band,
so I told him he should go.

12:21.608 --> 12:23.443
Well, if he's anything
like your father,

12:23.476 --> 12:24.978
he might
surprise you.

12:31.218 --> 12:33.453
What's going on?
I'm in the weeds,
Mommy!

12:33.486 --> 12:35.622
I burnt my galbi,
my tteok is bloated,

12:35.655 --> 12:37.958
and Grandpa hid
the creme brulee torch.

12:39.026 --> 12:40.828
This is why I quit.

12:40.861 --> 12:43.130
I can't work
under these conditions!

12:43.630 --> 12:44.664
(DOORBELL RINGS)

12:45.365 --> 12:47.167
Oh, no,
that's Emily.

12:47.200 --> 12:48.468
It's okay.
Mom will stall her.

12:48.501 --> 12:50.670
Just tell her about that
boring bank robbery dream

12:50.703 --> 12:51.805
you had the other night.

12:51.839 --> 12:53.240
That wasn't a dream!

12:55.242 --> 12:57.410
It's too late.
Valentine's Day is ruined.

13:01.048 --> 13:02.515
Great job, Dad.

13:02.549 --> 13:03.783
She's early!

13:03.817 --> 13:06.119
I was gonna come through
at the last minute,

13:06.153 --> 13:08.021
very dramatic.

13:11.992 --> 13:14.094
Hi, Emily.
Come on in.

13:14.127 --> 13:17.297
I brought
sparkling apple cider
left over from New Year's.

13:17.330 --> 13:19.332
My uncle's
a recovering alcoholic.

13:25.105 --> 13:27.640
I'm not gonna pussyfoot
around this, Emily.

13:27.674 --> 13:29.576
I ruined our
Valentine's Day dinner.

13:29.609 --> 13:33.680
It's okay. Valentine's Day
is a meaningless holiday.
Don't sweat it.

13:33.713 --> 13:36.349
No.
Stop saying it's a
meaningless holiday.

13:36.383 --> 13:37.985
You've got it all wrong.

13:38.018 --> 13:40.153
Look at how excited
Dave and Emily are!

13:40.187 --> 13:41.955
That's Valentine's Day.

13:41.989 --> 13:45.158
It's the one day a year we
focus on the people we love.

13:45.192 --> 13:46.826
And you know
who agrees?

13:46.860 --> 13:48.028
Dad.

13:50.530 --> 13:52.499
He wrote me
the most beautiful poem.

13:52.532 --> 13:54.501
No, Al, that's,
that's private.

13:54.534 --> 13:57.504
Maybe it's bromidic,
but I don't give an iota.

13:57.537 --> 13:59.973
When I'm with you,
it's like Alka-Seltzer

14:00.007 --> 14:01.308
in a bottle of soda.

14:02.609 --> 14:03.776
Hey, I wrote that!

14:04.444 --> 14:06.579
What?
For Emily!

14:06.613 --> 14:08.448
This was a gift
for you...

14:08.481 --> 14:12.519
that my father conveniently
decided was "too much."

14:16.656 --> 14:19.092
Aww, you remembered
I love NPR!

14:19.126 --> 14:21.261
This is the best
Valentine's Day ever!

14:21.294 --> 14:23.030
It is?

14:23.063 --> 14:26.099
Yep, best
Valentine's Day ever.

14:29.102 --> 14:30.337
Nice one, Dad.

14:30.370 --> 14:32.772
Hey, it was a
dishonest mistake.

14:34.574 --> 14:35.808
Come on, you two.

14:35.842 --> 14:38.678
I'll make PB&J's,
your way.

14:38.711 --> 14:40.047
Crusts or no crusts?

14:40.080 --> 14:41.982
I trust your judgment.

14:43.750 --> 14:44.817
Plagiarist!

14:48.021 --> 14:49.856
(PHONE RINGS)

14:51.024 --> 14:52.825
Clark,
why do keep calling me?

14:52.859 --> 14:54.694
It's Valentine's Day.

14:54.727 --> 14:56.529
Shouldn't you be on
your scavenger...

14:56.563 --> 14:57.864
Oh, no.

15:00.067 --> 15:03.036
But a lot of people don't even
do Valentine's Day.

15:03.070 --> 15:04.537
I mean, Molly here
was just saying

15:04.571 --> 15:06.473
it's a meaningless...
Hello?

15:16.316 --> 15:19.419
Isn't it bananas
how Dave and I wrote
the exact same poem?

15:22.389 --> 15:24.857
Look, you're not alone.

15:24.891 --> 15:27.027
I ruined Clark's night, too,
if you can believe it.

15:27.794 --> 15:30.263
I can.

15:30.297 --> 15:33.066
I'm sorry I didn't do anything
for Valentine's Day, Allison.

15:33.100 --> 15:35.135
I really thought I was
respecting your wishes.

15:35.168 --> 15:37.304
But I obviously wasn't,

15:37.337 --> 15:41.774
so I went ahead
and got what might be the last
reservation in all of L.A.

15:41.808 --> 15:45.378
Yeah, it's this Swiss/Thai
fusion place in the Valley.

15:45.412 --> 15:47.747
We can still have
a romantic night...

15:47.780 --> 15:51.184
sitting at the bar
if we promise
to be out by 8:00.

15:51.218 --> 15:54.554
I was telling the truth
when I said I didn't
wanna do anything.

15:54.587 --> 15:56.256
But then I saw
how excited Dave was

15:56.289 --> 15:58.525
about his first
Valentine's Day,

15:58.558 --> 16:00.827
and how over it
Molly was.

16:00.860 --> 16:03.863
It was like the ghosts
of Valentine's Day
past and future.

16:05.365 --> 16:07.634
What's it say about us
that we'd rather
just watch Netflix

16:07.667 --> 16:09.502
and take separate baths?

16:11.738 --> 16:14.741
Well, it means we've gone
to the next level
in our relationship,

16:14.774 --> 16:16.276
after years of
fighting traffic

16:16.309 --> 16:18.211
and overpaying for
chocolate souffles.

16:18.245 --> 16:20.480
I mean, I don't even like
chocolate souffles.

16:20.513 --> 16:21.748
(LAUGHING) Nobody does!

16:21.781 --> 16:22.915
They're garbage!

16:22.949 --> 16:24.717
It's fattening air!

16:28.721 --> 16:31.991
All I want for Valentine's Day
is to be with you.

16:32.025 --> 16:35.595
See, that's more special than
anything you could buy me

16:35.628 --> 16:37.830
or steal from our
11-year-old son.

16:40.833 --> 16:42.469
Well, I guess
I'll have to cancel

16:42.502 --> 16:45.205
that reservation
at Bangkok Alps.

16:45.238 --> 16:48.108
You know what?
I have a better idea.

16:48.141 --> 16:51.478
Call Jae.
You can't not do anything
for Valentine's Day.

16:51.511 --> 16:52.879
You guys aren't doing
anything.

16:52.912 --> 16:55.348
Yeah, but we already
paid our dues.

16:55.382 --> 16:57.850
We've our earned
our apathy, young lady.
You haven't.

16:59.452 --> 17:01.388
Your dad made
a sketchy reservation,

17:01.421 --> 17:02.955
and you're gonna get
your butt off that couch

17:02.989 --> 17:05.758
and you're gonna have
a just-okay time, our treat.

17:06.893 --> 17:08.161
Fine, I'll go.

17:08.195 --> 17:09.829
But I really
don't want to.

17:09.862 --> 17:12.432
Now, that's
the Valentine's Day spirit.

17:16.736 --> 17:18.738
Yo, man,
throw your body into it!

17:19.939 --> 17:21.141
Damona,
what's going on?

17:21.174 --> 17:23.543
Pat's date...
She's stuck in a bathroom!

17:23.576 --> 17:26.479
Really? Why, it's
a Valentine's Day miracle!

17:27.480 --> 17:30.183
You have a low threshold
for miracles.

17:31.017 --> 17:32.519
MEGAN:
The door handle broke off!

17:32.552 --> 17:35.655
I was trying to text you,
but I wasn't getting
any service!

17:35.688 --> 17:37.757
Oh, this is just
Megan's luck!

17:39.826 --> 17:42.262
Oh, thank you!
Hi!

17:42.295 --> 17:44.063
Oh, I thought
you'd left.

17:44.097 --> 17:45.832
No. I told you
I was gonna come back.

17:45.865 --> 17:47.534
How was I to know
you weren't lying?

17:47.567 --> 17:49.102
I'm very damaged.

17:49.136 --> 17:50.937
And you took your purse.

17:50.970 --> 17:53.240
That's because the guy
usually leaves me.

17:53.273 --> 17:55.242
And then my purse
gets stolen.

17:55.275 --> 17:58.211
Oh, one time, it was my date
who robbed me.

17:59.045 --> 18:01.114
But at least
he paid for dinner.

18:02.215 --> 18:04.151
I would never steal
your purse.

18:04.184 --> 18:06.052
Oh.
I'd go through it.

18:06.819 --> 18:07.987
Damaged.

18:09.189 --> 18:10.423
Come on, let's get
you something to eat.
Okay.

18:10.457 --> 18:12.091
(LAUGHS)

18:14.594 --> 18:15.795
Hey.

18:16.829 --> 18:18.565
I'm really sorry.

18:18.598 --> 18:19.899
Baby, I don't care
that you dated him,

18:19.932 --> 18:21.033
but you should have
told me.

18:21.067 --> 18:22.202
Yeah, I know,
you're right.

18:22.235 --> 18:24.771
Let's just be honest with
each other from now on, okay?

18:25.705 --> 18:27.507
All right, absolutely.

18:28.741 --> 18:29.909
I don't like
your sister.

18:30.610 --> 18:32.479
Neither do I.
See?

18:32.512 --> 18:33.546
(LAUGHS)

18:33.580 --> 18:35.215
And she doesn't like you,
either.

18:40.052 --> 18:42.422
It's not flat,
but it's plenty warm.

18:42.455 --> 18:43.623
(LAUGHS)

18:43.656 --> 18:45.158
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

18:46.058 --> 18:48.127
Ooh, they're here!
Who?

18:48.161 --> 18:49.362
Clark and Connor.

18:49.396 --> 18:50.730
I totally messed up
their scavenger hunt,

18:50.763 --> 18:52.299
but I totally fixed it!
Gift's over there.

18:54.634 --> 18:55.735
Hey!

18:59.506 --> 19:01.140
Okay,
my final clue says,

19:01.174 --> 19:02.709
"Your present is present

19:02.742 --> 19:05.612
"at the house
of the greatest doctor
who has ever lived."

19:05.645 --> 19:08.080
At first we went
to Dr. Tuttle's house,

19:08.114 --> 19:09.716
but now we are here.

19:11.117 --> 19:12.585
(GASPS)
Yay, I did it!

19:12.619 --> 19:13.986
Hey!
I found my present!

19:14.020 --> 19:15.555
Yay!
(LAUGHS)

19:15.588 --> 19:18.625
Thank you for this super
romantic adventure,

19:18.658 --> 19:20.727
that weirdly ended
in your boss' living room.

19:23.129 --> 19:24.531
What is this?
Thank you.

19:24.564 --> 19:26.433
It's the e-mail
I wrote to Damona

19:26.466 --> 19:28.134
the morning after
our first date.

19:28.167 --> 19:29.402
You see
the subject line?

19:30.870 --> 19:32.905
"I can't wait
to marry this man."

19:32.939 --> 19:35.708
(CHUCKLES)
You really wrote that?

19:35.742 --> 19:37.510
I mean,
I didn't wanna say
anything before

19:37.544 --> 19:39.712
because I didn't want you
to think I was crazy,

19:39.746 --> 19:41.514
but it's still true.

19:43.149 --> 19:45.952
I cannot wait
to marry you,

19:45.985 --> 19:49.188
knowing that every day
is going to be an adventure.

19:49.222 --> 19:50.823
We'll have our ups
and downs,

19:52.058 --> 19:54.561
outside forces
trying to tear us apart.

20:00.367 --> 20:03.002
But through it all,
we'll be at each other's side.

20:06.939 --> 20:09.242
BOTH: Oh!

20:09.276 --> 20:12.044
I got my romantic
Valentine's Day after all.

20:12.579 --> 20:13.746
You're welcome.

20:14.647 --> 20:15.815
Ken, wine.

20:15.848 --> 20:16.849
Yes, sir.

20:19.886 --> 20:22.054
(LAUGHS)

20:22.088 --> 20:24.156
Hey, how was
Bangkok Alps?

20:24.190 --> 20:27.159
Ah, it was totally cheesy,
but fun-cheesy.

20:27.193 --> 20:28.295
And actually cheesy.

20:28.328 --> 20:29.496
We had Pad Thai fondue.

20:31.331 --> 20:34.166
And Jae got me
this teddy bear.

20:35.968 --> 20:37.370
Ironically.

20:38.237 --> 20:39.772
Well, ironic or not,

20:39.806 --> 20:42.742
that stuff is what ends up
being special later on.

20:42.775 --> 20:44.577
Like warm Coke.

20:44.611 --> 20:45.945
You're welcome.

20:47.246 --> 20:48.915
Oh, is this that new show
everyone's bingeing?

20:49.816 --> 20:51.684
Hey, did Emily
get home okay?

20:51.718 --> 20:53.252
She practically
floated home

20:53.286 --> 20:55.822
with the Valentine's Day
I gave her.

20:56.689 --> 20:58.090
Sometimes you just have
to man up

20:58.124 --> 20:59.492
and give your girl
a good night.

20:59.526 --> 21:01.928
Okay, guys,
take it down a notch.

21:03.029 --> 21:04.864
Oh, is that the show
everyone's bingeing?

21:04.897 --> 21:07.166
I just got
a text from Linda,

21:07.199 --> 21:09.636
three hearts
and a sad-face emoji.

21:09.669 --> 21:11.371
We're back together.

21:12.305 --> 21:14.240
I'm gonna head
over there... Oh!

21:14.273 --> 21:15.708
I wanna see this.

21:15.742 --> 21:17.610
Everybody's
talking about it.

21:19.178 --> 21:22.382
Now, this is what
Valentine's Day

21:24.317 --> 21:26.986
Yes, Dad, Valentine's Day
is all about zombies.
