her in the corner,

doing little secret games.

off so the guy shoves him

48:32.777 --> 48:35.811
In the ancient times in
the valley of the gnome,

48:35.813 --> 48:37.747
the first born
children were forced

48:37.749 --> 48:39.148
to swim in the lake of fire.

48:39.150 --> 48:42.551
And so the land was
polluted with blood.

48:42.553 --> 48:44.987
Then came Moloch,
the benevolent.

48:44.989 --> 48:47.490
Merciful Moloch, he
commanded the Canaanites

48:47.492 --> 48:49.525
relinquish control
of the children.

48:50.662 --> 48:52.895
And so the children
of Canaan were passed

48:52.897 --> 48:55.331
through the fire nevermore.

48:55.333 --> 48:58.000
Henceforth, they were
consecrated to his high priest...

See you around six.

01:17:37.420 --> 01:17:41.022
Some of my trees
are 3,000 years old.

01:17:42.892 --> 01:17:44.992
You know how they feed?

01:17:44.994 --> 01:17:47.495
Their arteries run
below the surface

01:17:48.564 --> 01:17:51.866
100 feet in all directions.

01:17:53.002 --> 01:17:55.202
You can't see them,
but their veins

01:17:55.204 --> 01:17:58.205
are there swallowing life.

01:17:58.207 --> 01:18:01.008
So it is the way we come at you.

01:18:01.010 --> 01:18:03.110
We're in your house
at every hour,

01:18:03.112 --> 01:18:06.213
watching everything
you ever say or do.

01:18:15.358 --> 01:18:17.358
Tonight you will
witness the dark passage.

01:18:19.729 --> 01:18:22.329
Behold the five
sides of your shield

01:18:22.331 --> 01:18:26.100
and consider this this
oath that we give to you,

01:18:26.102 --> 01:18:27.568
crowned prince.

01:18:27.570 --> 01:18:29.403
One baptism.

01:18:29.405 --> 01:18:31.272
One sacrifice.

01:18:31.274 --> 01:18:34.608
We summon tonight the great
Leviathan within this child

01:18:35.712 --> 01:18:38.145
and we offer to you
his soul in veneration

01:18:38.948 --> 01:18:41.916
on this, the 52nd year of Satan.

01:18:41.918 --> 01:18:43.317
- May the fires of hell.
- May the fires of hell

01:18:43.319 --> 01:18:44.552
- burn inside him.
- Burn inside him

01:18:44.554 --> 01:18:46.654
- and give him strength.
- And give him strength.

01:18:46.656 --> 01:18:48.589
Tonight, little boy,
we will leave this place

01:18:48.591 --> 01:18:51.392
and go to the capital,
where for the rest

01:18:51.394 --> 01:18:54.295
of your formative
years you will indulge

01:18:54.297 --> 01:18:58.399
in every fleshly
pleasure known to man.

We're sisters.

01:19:18.488 --> 01:19:19.754
Don't you see, Duffy?

01:19:21.224 --> 01:19:23.090

Mommy's here.

01:19:47.650 --> 01:19:50.851
That nice man is gonna take
you on a trip with him.

01:19:50.853 --> 01:19:53.621
LOUIE: But I don't wanna
go on a trip with him.

01:19:53.623 --> 01:19:55.823
But he's the high priest.

01:19:55.825 --> 01:19:58.092
There'll be lots of other
boys there to play with.

01:19:58.094 --> 01:20:00.161
Special boys, just like you.

01:20:06.736 --> 01:20:09.537

01:20:14.877 --> 01:20:16.410
Very good.

01:20:16.412 --> 01:20:17.611
And now breathe.

01:20:19.382 --> 01:20:22.516
Because when we enter
this life, we inhale,

01:20:23.553 --> 01:20:26.654
and when we exit
this life, we exhale.

01:20:28.491 --> 01:20:31.592
Now, take your final
breath in this room

01:20:32.695 --> 01:20:34.261

the true grail.

01:20:35.298 --> 01:20:36.298
