00:10.718 --> 00:13.054
- "Not great at math."

00:13.121 --> 00:14.956
What kind of idiot
would write that?

00:15.056 --> 00:17.458
- Look at this kid.
Going nowhere real fast.

00:17.559 --> 00:22.363
- "Not great at math?"
I'm gonna destroy this guy.

00:22.430 --> 00:23.932
- Hey, Randy, what's new?

00:24.032 --> 00:25.567
How's that applesauce? Good?
- Tom.

00:25.633 --> 00:27.635
You know I don't like
talking about applesauce.

00:27.735 --> 00:29.771
They take an apple,
they mush it up,

00:29.871 --> 00:32.373
they make it sauce, we eat it.
End of story.

00:32.440 --> 00:34.475
- Sorry, Randy.
- "I'm not great at math?"

00:34.576 --> 00:36.311
- What? What's wrong?
- Come on, Tom!

00:36.411 --> 00:37.912
You need to run this stuff
by me first.

00:37.979 --> 00:39.581
- I promised
my mom I'd be honest.

00:39.647 --> 00:41.482
I thought people would
find it disarmingly charming.

00:41.583 --> 00:43.551
- That's too honest.
Look at the posters.

00:43.618 --> 00:45.753
People are not even
defacing the posters.

00:45.820 --> 00:48.056
That's how bad it is.
- The reaction has been tepid.

00:48.122 --> 00:49.324
- All right, let's not panic.

00:49.424 --> 00:50.825
We can save this
with a good speech.

00:50.925 --> 00:52.260
- Oh, yeah, I've got
a speech that's gonna

00:52.327 --> 00:53.995
knock your dick off.
- Excuse me?

00:54.095 --> 00:55.730
- Don't tell anyone
I said that.

00:55.797 --> 00:57.665
I'm not allowed to curse.
- We just gonna let that slide.

00:57.765 --> 00:59.233
Just run the speech by me,
baby, let's go.

00:59.300 --> 01:01.069
- All right, it goes,
"Hi, my name is Tom,

01:01.135 --> 01:02.670
and I apologize
for my appearance."

01:02.770 --> 01:04.172
- Why am I friends
with this guy?

01:04.272 --> 01:05.840
- All right, and then it
kicks into high gear.

01:05.940 --> 01:07.175
"Sure, I'm not great at math,

01:07.275 --> 01:08.943
"and sure,
I don't tuck in my shirts,

01:09.010 --> 01:10.778
"but someone
has to be the treasurer.

01:10.845 --> 01:12.680
So why not me? Vote for Tom."

01:12.780 --> 01:14.916
- Tom, this is the worst
speech I've ever heard.

01:14.983 --> 01:17.118
- What part don't you like?
- Hey, mind if I join you guys?

01:17.185 --> 01:18.753
- Oh, woah,
you eat in the cafeteria?

01:18.820 --> 01:20.755
- Technically, I never
graduated from this school,

01:20.822 --> 01:23.024
so yes, my student ID
still works.

01:23.124 --> 01:25.593
- You still go here?
- Yes, I'm basically enrolled.

01:25.660 --> 01:27.829
I'm one of you.
I'm amongst my peers here.

01:27.929 --> 01:29.464
- Don't touch me.
- Get out of my way, kid.

01:29.530 --> 01:31.766
That's my seat.
It's been my seat for 26 years.

01:31.833 --> 01:33.167
- I hate this. I hate you guys.

01:33.267 --> 01:34.369
- So what are we talking about?

01:34.469 --> 01:35.436
- Tom's running for office,

01:35.503 --> 01:36.471
but he's not comfortable

01:36.537 --> 01:37.538
with the concept of lying.

01:37.639 --> 01:39.040
- You don't need to lie, Tom.

01:39.140 --> 01:41.442
You need to learn
to stretch the truth.

01:41.509 --> 01:42.710
- What does that mean?

01:42.810 --> 01:43.978
- You talk in a way
that's deceiving

01:44.045 --> 01:46.047
but not technically a lie.

01:46.147 --> 01:47.782
- Okay?
- Let me give you an example.

01:47.849 --> 01:49.283
You can't say something like,

01:49.350 --> 01:51.686
"I will be a good treasurer,"
'cause you won't.

01:51.786 --> 01:53.321
- Of course not.
I'll be the worst.

01:53.388 --> 01:56.057
- You say, "I believe
I will be a good treasurer."

01:56.157 --> 01:58.059
- Oh, that's good.
That is nice.

01:58.159 --> 01:59.794
- Wow, this is like
a whole new language.

01:59.861 --> 02:01.963
Can you help me rewrite
my speech? We've got an hour.

02:02.030 --> 02:03.564
- Tom, I got nothing but time.

02:03.665 --> 02:07.335
As a bus driver, I'm busy
from about 8:00 to 8:20 a.m.

02:07.402 --> 02:10.738
and then again
from 2:00 to 2:20 p.m.

02:10.838 --> 02:13.374
Otherwise, I'm good to go.

02:13.474 --> 02:15.743
- So in conclusion,
as treasurer,

02:15.843 --> 02:18.546
I will work hard
and do what's best

02:18.646 --> 02:19.647
for the school.

02:19.714 --> 02:20.915
And more importantly,

02:21.015 --> 02:24.419
I am not Tom.

02:24.519 --> 02:26.688
Thank you. Not Tom.

02:26.754 --> 02:28.923
- Okay, he's, uh, not Tom.

02:29.023 --> 02:32.260
- Next up for treasurer is--
and don't boo people.

02:32.360 --> 02:34.429
Please, come on, be nice,
listen to him.

02:34.529 --> 02:36.597
Please welcome Tom.

02:36.698 --> 02:39.033
- This guy sounds trustworthy.

02:39.100 --> 02:40.268
- Thank you.

02:40.368 --> 02:41.936
Anyone who knows me
knows I'm a...

02:42.036 --> 02:43.738
real straight shooting
son of a B.

02:43.838 --> 02:45.273
The kinda guy
you can have a beer with

02:45.373 --> 02:48.109
if you're old enough
to drink beer.

02:48.209 --> 02:49.944
- Tell 'em, Tom. Preach!

02:50.044 --> 02:52.680
- I don't know much about math,
but here's what I do know.

02:52.747 --> 02:54.882
I believe school should be fun.

02:54.949 --> 02:57.552
- Okay, yes,
that's interesting.

02:57.618 --> 02:58.953
- I believe

02:59.053 --> 03:00.688
we should have a rock climbing
wall in the gym.

03:00.755 --> 03:02.123
How does that sound?
- Yes!

03:02.223 --> 03:03.758
- I believe!
- What? That's so dangerous.

03:03.858 --> 03:05.593
- I believe we should have
free gum

03:05.693 --> 03:07.929
being shot out of a cannon...
- What?

03:08.029 --> 03:09.530
- As we walk
to and from the bus.

03:09.597 --> 03:10.698
That's what I believe.

03:10.765 --> 03:11.966
- Yeah, Tom!
- I'm a believer!

03:12.066 --> 03:13.868
- Hey, hey, hey,
come on, you guys.

03:13.935 --> 03:16.137
- I believe we should have
an old Italian man

03:16.237 --> 03:18.106
feeding us gelato
throughout the day.

03:18.206 --> 03:19.807
- I hear you, baby!
- Yes, say it!

03:19.907 --> 03:21.809
- Gelato?
- All I know is this.

03:21.909 --> 03:23.211
I believe my name is Tom,

03:23.277 --> 03:24.812
and I believe I'm running
for treasurer.

03:24.912 --> 03:26.280
Thank you.
- Yeah, Tom!

03:26.380 --> 03:28.382
- Go, Tom! Whoo!

03:28.449 --> 03:29.951
- Gotta believe.

03:30.418 --> 03:31.786
<i>- All right, gang.
Well, listen.</i>

03:31.886 --> 03:33.654
This is our first
student council meeting.

03:33.755 --> 03:35.389
- Woo!
- So there you go.

03:35.456 --> 03:36.724
I like the enthusiasm.

03:36.791 --> 03:38.993
Let's introduce
our brand-new president.

03:39.093 --> 03:41.095
Take it away, Dakota.
- Okay, thank you.

03:41.162 --> 03:43.831
Uh, guys,
our first order of business

03:43.931 --> 03:46.934
is to discuss these
insane promises Tom made

03:47.001 --> 03:48.302
to become treasurer.

03:48.402 --> 03:49.904
- Oh, no, no,
those weren't promises.

03:49.971 --> 03:51.439
I just listed things
I believe in.

03:51.506 --> 03:52.974
So I think
we're good to go here.

03:53.074 --> 03:56.344
- Good to go?
Tom, you lied to everyone.

03:56.444 --> 03:58.679
- No, I stretched the truth.
It's very common.

03:58.780 --> 04:00.114
- What was the truth part?

04:00.181 --> 04:01.949
- Gelato clearly exists.

04:02.016 --> 04:04.185
No one's disputing that,
are they?

04:04.285 --> 04:05.686
If you're gonna be
sticklers about it,

04:05.787 --> 04:07.288
I mean, let's just
purchase all the stuff

04:07.355 --> 04:09.023
and be done with it, right?
Meeting adjourned.

04:09.123 --> 04:10.691
- First of all,
you can't adjourn a meeting.

04:10.792 --> 04:12.493
Treasurers can't adjourn meetings.

04:12.593 --> 04:13.661
- Oh, no,
the treasurer is all--

04:13.761 --> 04:15.096
all powerful.
- What?

04:15.163 --> 04:16.697
- I thought I'm the boss.
What happened?

04:16.798 --> 04:18.499
- How would you pay
for all this stuff?

04:18.599 --> 04:20.268
- How would I pay?
That's not my department.

04:20.334 --> 04:22.036
- Yes, it is!
- I'm just the treasurer.

04:22.136 --> 04:24.005
- I don't think he knows
what a treasurer does.

04:24.105 --> 04:25.706
- I obviously know
what a treasurer is

04:25.807 --> 04:28.509
if I ran for the job. I--
- So what is it?

04:28.609 --> 04:31.012
- I oversee the inner workings
of the school.

04:31.112 --> 04:33.381
- Even you know
you're full of you-know-what.

04:33.481 --> 04:36.117
- No, okay, I have to
stop this right here.

04:36.184 --> 04:37.685
- Not a strong first meeting.

04:37.785 --> 04:40.188
- Tom, I worked very hard
to become class president,

04:40.288 --> 04:42.223
and I need my first
hundred days to go well.

04:42.323 --> 04:43.891
- Okay.
- My father is a CPA.

04:43.991 --> 04:45.693
I want you to go to
his office tonight,

04:45.793 --> 04:49.363
and he'll teach you his, uh,
quote, "accounting tricks."

04:49.463 --> 04:50.865
Got it?
- Oh, no, please, no.

04:50.965 --> 04:52.967
Anyone but your dad.
He's messed up.

04:53.034 --> 04:55.136
You gotta admit, Dakota,
your dad is messed up.

04:55.203 --> 04:57.171
- He's got his issues,
but when it comes to, quote,

04:57.238 --> 04:59.540
"cooking the books," unquote,

04:59.640 --> 05:01.175
he's the best in the biz.

05:04.645 --> 05:06.414
<i>- Now, listen, Tom,
right out of the gate</i>

05:06.514 --> 05:08.349
let's address
the elephant in the room.

05:08.416 --> 05:11.152
I mean, I did some weird stuff
on that fishing trip.

05:11.219 --> 05:12.720
- It was.
It was very weird.

05:12.820 --> 05:14.755
- Trying to bang an escort
in front of a little kid.

05:14.856 --> 05:16.924
Who does that?
- That was a lot to process.

05:17.024 --> 05:19.260
- Peeing in a circle.
I mean, that's not for me.

05:19.360 --> 05:20.761
- I don't know why
I went along with it.

05:20.862 --> 05:23.097
- So Dakota tells me
you need my help.

05:23.197 --> 05:26.267
- I do; I need to find funds
in our student council budget.

05:26.367 --> 05:28.269
I miscalculated by,
like, 20 grand.

05:28.369 --> 05:29.770
- Well, this should be easy.

05:32.874 --> 05:34.442
- What's happening?

05:34.542 --> 05:37.211
- Bang! Eight Gs just like that
out of nowhere.

05:37.278 --> 05:40.281
- Wow.
- Depreciate some assets there,

05:40.381 --> 05:43.184
move that over there.
Yeah, take that, number seven.

05:43.251 --> 05:44.685
- Wow, you really
get into this, don't you?

05:44.752 --> 05:46.187
You're taking your shirt off,
oh, my God!

05:46.254 --> 05:47.455
- Well, it's gotta
come off, Tom,

05:47.555 --> 05:49.056
I'm a superhuman computer.

05:49.123 --> 05:50.958
- Feels inappropriate,
but let's keep adding.

05:51.058 --> 05:53.594
- Yeah! Ah, fund it, baby,
fund it.

05:53.694 --> 05:54.795
- Oh, my God.

05:54.896 --> 05:56.530
- Yeah, feels good,
doesn't it, Tom?

05:56.597 --> 05:58.099
- It's a little weird but--
- Yeah.

05:58.199 --> 06:00.368
Take that down your throat,
number five.

06:00.434 --> 06:02.036
- This is on the up and up?
We can do all this?

06:02.103 --> 06:04.972
- We can do anything
we damn well please.

06:05.072 --> 06:07.909
We're accountants, bitch.
- You calling me a bitch or--

06:07.975 --> 06:10.544
- The secret is to create
a document that's so thick

06:10.611 --> 06:12.647
no one will take the time
to read it.

06:12.747 --> 06:15.416
And...done.
- All right, great.

06:15.483 --> 06:16.918
Thanks for all your help.
- All right.

06:16.984 --> 06:18.486
- The whole thing was great,
a lot of fun.

06:18.586 --> 06:19.820
The music,
the taking the shirt off.

06:19.921 --> 06:21.589
The whole thing
was really great.

06:23.591 --> 06:26.127
Good news, principal.
I found the money.

06:26.227 --> 06:27.328
- What is this?

06:27.428 --> 06:28.963
- Feast your eyes
on the new budget.

06:29.063 --> 06:31.666
- Okay, I gotta ask you.
How did you find this money?

06:31.766 --> 06:34.568
- You know, I ran the numbers,
crunched the, uh, math.

06:34.635 --> 06:36.604
It's all in the document.
Feel free to read it.

06:36.671 --> 06:39.173
- Uh, how many pages is that?
- Exactly 1,000.

06:39.273 --> 06:42.176
- Wow, okay.
- I just need an approval.

06:42.276 --> 06:44.178
If you wanna read it,
that's on you.

06:44.278 --> 06:45.613
- Well, you know what, Tom?

06:45.680 --> 06:48.182
I trust you, it's approved.
- Amazing.

06:49.283 --> 06:52.520
- A rock climbing wall.
Wow, Tom.

06:52.620 --> 06:54.622
How much did this thing cost?

06:54.689 --> 06:56.691
- Don't worry about the money.
That's my department.

06:56.791 --> 07:00.461
- All right, everybody!
Who likes gum?

07:00.528 --> 07:02.196
Boom!
- This is amazing!

07:02.296 --> 07:04.031
- Bubble-licious!

07:04.131 --> 07:06.267
- Wait, did he fly you in
from Italy?

07:06.334 --> 07:08.336
- He doesn't speak English,
but yes, I flew him in.

07:08.436 --> 07:11.706
That's right, rock climbing
wall compliments of Tom.

07:11.806 --> 07:14.308
- Thank Tom, Tom the treasurer!

07:14.375 --> 07:18.212
He got you this gum! Yeah!

07:18.312 --> 07:19.780
- All right, enjoy, everyone.

07:19.847 --> 07:22.550
Remember who got this for you,
Gelato Tom.

07:22.650 --> 07:24.618
- Hey, hey, hey.
Come on in, guys.

07:24.685 --> 07:25.686
- Hey, hi.
- Hey.

07:25.786 --> 07:26.887
- I'm proud of you, Dakota.

07:26.988 --> 07:27.989
You're the most
popular president

07:28.055 --> 07:29.357
this school's ever had.

07:29.457 --> 07:30.725
- I have to say
it was a team effort.

07:30.825 --> 07:31.959
Tom did a great job
with the budget.

07:32.026 --> 07:33.494
- Glad it's working out,
you know?

07:33.561 --> 07:35.062
It's just the way I am.
I get things done,

07:35.162 --> 07:36.697
and I deliver the goods.

07:36.797 --> 07:39.400
- Sorry to interrupt.
We got a disaster on our hands.

07:39.500 --> 07:40.568
- That didn't take long.

07:40.668 --> 07:41.969
- Nelson, please,

07:42.036 --> 07:43.637
you're not part of
the student government.

07:43.704 --> 07:45.006
- I'm Tom's fixer.

07:45.072 --> 07:46.407
- Yeah, he's my guy.
Is there an issue?

07:46.507 --> 07:47.875
- Gelato guy says
his check bounced.

07:47.975 --> 07:49.243
- Oh, no.
- Hector's on his way.

07:49.343 --> 07:50.678
- Hector?
- Yeah, he's coming to see

07:50.745 --> 07:52.146
the budget.
He think you lied, Tom.

07:52.213 --> 07:53.681
- How could I lie?
It's all in the document.

07:53.748 --> 07:56.150
- Yeah, he prepared
this big, thick document.

07:56.217 --> 07:58.819
- Did you even
read that document?

07:58.886 --> 08:01.222
- Oh, no, what have I done?

08:01.322 --> 08:03.724
Fantasy football stats?
- Oh, no, don't read it.

08:03.824 --> 08:05.526
- This is a job application?
- Stop reading that.

08:05.593 --> 08:06.761
Don't--don't look at that.

08:06.861 --> 08:08.662
- Leasing offers
for a Dodge Durango?

08:08.729 --> 08:09.930
He just glued stuff together.

08:10.031 --> 08:11.332
- That's literally
a leasing quote?

08:11.399 --> 08:13.167
- This whole thing
is gibberish, Tom.

08:13.234 --> 08:15.436
- There are clearly some typos.
- Tom, you're a great friend,

08:15.536 --> 08:17.004
but I'm throwing you
to the wolves now.

08:17.071 --> 08:18.439
- Your dad's the one
who printed it, so...

08:18.539 --> 08:19.940
- I don't know
who you're talking about.

08:20.041 --> 08:21.942
My dad's a chiropractor,
and I was never here.

08:22.043 --> 08:22.943
- What is going on here?

08:23.044 --> 08:24.278
The whole administration

08:24.378 --> 08:26.047
is betraying
their beloved treasurer.

08:26.113 --> 08:28.849
- Okay, listen, this looks
really bad for both of us.

08:28.916 --> 08:30.618
There's only
one thing we can do.

08:30.718 --> 08:32.253
- Be honest
like my mom says, right?

08:32.353 --> 08:34.789
- No, not at all.
You go on a shredding rampage.

08:34.889 --> 08:37.291
- Oh.
- Nelson, go distract Hector

08:37.391 --> 08:38.759
and buy us some time.
- I'm on it.

08:38.859 --> 08:40.027
- Tom, start shredding.

08:40.094 --> 08:41.695
Just shred,
shred, shred, shred.

08:41.762 --> 08:43.697
- We should lower our voices
if nothing else, right?

08:43.764 --> 08:44.932
If you're gonna shred,

08:45.032 --> 08:46.600
you don't scream,
"Shred, shred."

08:46.700 --> 08:49.136
- What? Are you trying to
just be right on something?

08:49.236 --> 08:50.638
Shred, shred, shred!

08:50.738 --> 08:52.640
Imagine what a maniac
looks like when he shreds,

08:52.740 --> 08:54.308
and then do that.

08:57.778 --> 08:59.914
- Yo, Hector,
could I ask you a question?

08:59.980 --> 09:01.749
- I'm in a hurry. What?

09:01.816 --> 09:03.150
- I was thinking,

09:03.250 --> 09:04.985
there's not a lot
of famous Hectors, are there?

09:05.086 --> 09:06.287
- What?
What are you talking about?

09:06.387 --> 09:08.155
There's Hector Ballesteros,

09:08.255 --> 09:09.790
you know,
the Colombian weightlifter.

09:09.890 --> 09:11.826
- Nah, that don't count.
Famous weightlifter?

09:11.926 --> 09:13.260
- Yeah, he's a big deal.

09:13.327 --> 09:16.664
Hector Crawford,
the Australian radio producer.

09:16.764 --> 09:18.432
- There's no such thing.
- Trust me, there are more.

09:18.499 --> 09:20.101
I just don't have time
for this right now.

09:20.167 --> 09:21.802
- Wait, whoa, Hector,
come back, there's a call.

09:21.902 --> 09:23.070
There's a call for you
on my phone.

09:23.137 --> 09:24.071
I think it's an emergency.

09:24.138 --> 09:25.473
Hector, they need you!

09:27.775 --> 09:29.343
- You know what, Tom?
I'm proud of you.

09:29.443 --> 09:31.846
I mean, this is a great
life lesson in integrity.

09:31.946 --> 09:34.315
- Integrity? I feel like
we're covering up a lie, no?

09:34.415 --> 09:35.683
- Stop. I love that your head's

09:35.783 --> 09:37.418
always spinning
with ideas but no.

09:37.485 --> 09:40.821
When something is shredded,
right? You're following me?

09:40.921 --> 09:42.957
- Yeah.
- It's like it never existed.

09:43.023 --> 09:44.091
- What does that mean?
I don't--

09:44.158 --> 09:45.759
- Abraham Lincoln said,

09:45.826 --> 09:49.263
"Shredding isn't lying.
It's the absence of the truth."

09:49.330 --> 09:51.799
- I can't imagine
Abe Lincoln had a shredder.

09:51.866 --> 09:53.534
- Somebody said it.
- Ah-ha!

09:53.634 --> 09:54.768
The jig is up, Tom.

09:54.835 --> 09:56.203
I know you cooked the books,

09:56.303 --> 09:57.705
and I wanna see this budget.

09:57.805 --> 10:00.040
- Do you see a budget?
I don't see a budget.

10:00.141 --> 10:02.176
- Wait a minute.
Are you shredding evidence?

10:02.276 --> 10:03.711
- I don't think
there was a budget.

10:03.811 --> 10:05.479
I don't know
if a budget even existed.

10:05.546 --> 10:06.847
Who's to say?
- Wait a minute.

10:06.947 --> 10:08.382
Isn't this the budget
right here?

10:08.482 --> 10:10.885
- Wait, what?
- "Student council budget."

10:10.985 --> 10:12.720
- Oh, no, don't touch that.
- Tom, please!

10:12.820 --> 10:14.622
What have you just been
shredding this whole time?

10:14.688 --> 10:16.056
- I was just
shredding everything

10:16.157 --> 10:17.825
in the filing cabinets.
- Oh, my God!

10:17.892 --> 10:19.894
Tom, you shredded
the students' master files!

10:19.994 --> 10:21.795
- You've really gotta do
something about your voice.

10:21.862 --> 10:24.031
It sounds too high.
- This is a disaster!

10:24.131 --> 10:25.900
- Are those important?
- Yes, they're important.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.402
Now every student
has to repeat fifth grade,

10:28.502 --> 10:30.204
and you know what?
I want you to tell them.

10:30.304 --> 10:32.206
- Okay, I'll write a speech
that'll knock your dick off.

10:32.306 --> 10:33.674
- Woah.
- Forget--forget I said it.

10:33.741 --> 10:35.142
That was inappropriate.

10:35.209 --> 10:37.211
I'll just prepare some remarks.
How's that?

10:37.311 --> 10:39.079
Hey guys, it's Tom,
your beloved treasurer,

10:39.180 --> 10:40.548
here with another speech.

10:40.648 --> 10:44.084
Listen, it sounds like
due to a shredding mishap

10:44.185 --> 10:45.819
we're just gonna start
fifth grade over

10:45.886 --> 10:49.490
so should be a fun year.

10:49.557 --> 10:50.858
By the way,
am I still treasurer

10:50.925 --> 10:52.092
in this scenario or no?

10:52.193 --> 10:53.661
- No, Tom,
you're not treasurer.

10:53.727 --> 10:55.196
You're gonna resign.
- All right, this is--

10:55.262 --> 10:56.864
I guess this is also
my resignation speech.

10:56.931 --> 10:58.365
So getting a lot done.
