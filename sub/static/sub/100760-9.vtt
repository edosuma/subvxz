going to make something

00:44.420 --> 00:45.629

trying to stop the idea.

01:03.856 --> 01:05.024
Are you kidding?

01:05.065 --> 01:06.984
- It's a huge deal.
- Fuck yeah.

01:07.026 --> 01:08.462
For one thing,
they're adding bitter,

01:08.486 --> 01:10.362
citrus and umami to our tongues.

have sweet and salty now?

Yes! Did that guy who stole
your company cut you in?

01:22.583 --> 01:24.186
- How are you affording this?
- Oh, Jamie?

01:24.210 --> 01:26.086
No, I can't actually prove
he did anything bad.

I know. I'm sorry.

10:32.466 --> 10:33.651
I've been feeling really guilty

10:33.675 --> 10:35.635
- about it lately, man.
- Good.

10:35.677 --> 10:37.488
If Oscar Mayer ever figures out
the whole download thing,

10:37.512 --> 10:39.139
I'm gonna come back
and kick your ass.

10:39.181 --> 10:41.433
I'd like that.

10:41.475 --> 10:43.852
Okay.

10:59.493 --> 11:01.203
Mr. Brown.

11:01.244 --> 11:03.389
It's my last night. I'll be
checking out in the morning.

11:03.413 --> 11:06.625
Oh. Shall I throw your bags
into the torrent?

11:06.666 --> 11:09.669
Uh, no. I'm moving down
to 2Gigs,

11:09.711 --> 11:11.671
so you can just move them there.

11:11.713 --> 11:13.131
Move them yourself.

11:14.591 --> 11:17.344
Hey, babe. Guess what?

11:17.386 --> 11:19.763
I'm upping your allowance
ten percent.

11:22.099 --> 11:24.726
Happy Winter Day. Ooh.

11:24.768 --> 11:26.770
♪ ♪

11:33.693 --> 11:36.863
Look, I could let you keep
paying for me,

11:36.905 --> 11:39.741
but my feelings have changed.

11:39.783 --> 11:41.952
It wouldn't be fair
to you or to me.

11:43.620 --> 11:45.580
Okay.

11:45.622 --> 11:49.418
I don't know where you got
this new dignity, but...

11:49.459 --> 11:50.961
it's making me hot.

11:51.002 --> 11:53.588
Stop.

11:53.630 --> 11:55.215
I'm sorry.

11:55.257 --> 11:58.427
Baby, you don't understand.

11:58.468 --> 12:02.597
I have to be the owner
of your scan, to protect you.

12:02.639 --> 12:04.349
Wait, what?

12:04.391 --> 12:06.351
People want you out of the way.

12:06.393 --> 12:09.062
Because of what you know,
or what you knew.

12:09.104 --> 12:10.331
Hold on,
what are you talking about?

12:10.355 --> 12:12.023
Are you in on this?

12:12.065 --> 12:13.692
- What do you know?
- Nothing.

12:13.733 --> 12:16.111
- Unless you want
to take me back...
- No, no, no, no.

12:16.153 --> 12:17.487
Was I murdered?

12:17.529 --> 12:18.947
Tell me!

12:18.989 --> 12:20.240
What do know? Tell me.

12:21.491 --> 12:23.910
Ingrid!

12:23.952 --> 12:25.954
Oh, God.

12:32.169 --> 12:34.129
There's a lot of people looking
on the ground

12:34.171 --> 12:35.672
- all over the place.
- Yeah.

12:35.714 --> 12:37.275
I know. That's where people
hide Easter eggs.

12:37.299 --> 12:39.551
-Under a bush.
-Well, maybe when
all the chickens

12:39.593 --> 12:40.969
are pecking under the same bush,

12:41.011 --> 12:42.447
the smart chicken
pecks by the water.

12:42.471 --> 12:45.515
What the fuck?
Just let me look, okay?

12:46.558 --> 12:48.602
Helping or hurting, Aleesha!

12:48.643 --> 12:51.313
Leeshee,

12:51.354 --> 12:53.773
Leeshee, no more work.

12:53.815 --> 12:56.318
Turn this shit off, okay?

12:56.359 --> 12:59.446
Come to the bar, we'll have
a drink, maybe do some shots,

12:59.488 --> 13:01.490
some whiskey, vodka.

13:01.531 --> 13:03.408
Do you like tequila,
do you like gin?

13:03.450 --> 13:06.453
Come on and party.

13:34.314 --> 13:36.149
Oh, I can't believe this.

13:36.191 --> 13:37.376
Ingrid knows something,
but she's too scared

13:37.400 --> 13:38.568
to tell me what it is.

13:38.610 --> 13:40.904
I need those memories back.

13:40.946 --> 13:42.656
People I love
could be in danger.

13:42.697 --> 13:44.783
Well, this morning,
I.T. made a big deal about

13:44.824 --> 13:46.785
everyone being asleep
during the update.

13:46.826 --> 13:49.204
Apparently it resets
memory adjustments.

13:49.246 --> 13:51.289
So I'm thinking maybe
if we keep you up,

13:51.331 --> 13:53.500
you know, it would do the same.

13:53.542 --> 13:56.795
It would restore any memories
anybody blocked or fucked with.

13:56.836 --> 13:58.556
Okay. Are you sure that's
what would happen?

13:58.588 --> 13:59.798
No.

13:59.839 --> 14:03.552
It's a guess,
but it's a good guess.

14:03.593 --> 14:05.178
Okay.

14:05.220 --> 14:07.347
Yeah, I'll risk it.

14:07.389 --> 14:09.766
All right, I need you
to keep me up tonight.

14:09.808 --> 14:11.935
- I need to know
what happened to me.
- Okay.

14:11.977 --> 14:13.937
I-I just need to set
some stuff up.

14:13.979 --> 14:16.439
All right.
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.

14:16.481 --> 14:17.899
Um...

14:18.942 --> 14:20.735
There's some good news, too.

14:20.777 --> 14:23.780
Um, I broke up with her.

14:23.822 --> 14:26.199
So...

14:29.494 --> 14:33.582
Oh, um, and I got you
a Winter present.

14:33.623 --> 14:37.419
Um, I don't have any money,

14:37.460 --> 14:40.130
so, uh, I mean, I made it.

14:40.171 --> 14:42.632
This is, uh,

14:42.674 --> 14:45.176
a pebble from the lakeshore

14:45.218 --> 14:47.178
when I made you laugh
for the first time.

14:47.220 --> 14:52.601
And, uh, this is a feather
that was close to the pebble...

14:52.642 --> 14:54.370
I didn't have a lot
to work with. This is stupid.

14:54.394 --> 14:57.147
No, I love it.

14:58.398 --> 15:00.567
Here.

15:07.949 --> 15:09.367
Oh, hang on.

15:09.409 --> 15:11.745
Sensation gloves.

15:25.508 --> 15:27.177
I can really feel it.

15:29.095 --> 15:31.473
It's beautiful.

15:31.514 --> 15:34.184
Oh, I got you something, too.

15:36.311 --> 15:37.479
Cool.

15:37.520 --> 15:39.481
No, you don't get it.

15:39.522 --> 15:40.899
It's an icon.

15:40.940 --> 15:42.984
I stole it
from one of the I.T. guys.

15:43.026 --> 15:44.819
They use it
when they're in the system.

15:44.861 --> 15:47.489
It exposes the code. See?

15:50.408 --> 15:53.370
Oh, wow.

15:53.411 --> 15:56.122
Yeah, maybe you can use it
to make things better.

15:56.164 --> 15:58.375
That's awesome. Thank you.

15:59.626 --> 16:01.920
Oh, my God.

16:01.961 --> 16:06.299
I just felt you
for the first time.

16:07.550 --> 16:09.552
For real.

16:22.273 --> 16:24.818
That's, um...

16:24.859 --> 16:26.611
Really nice.

16:27.654 --> 16:29.656
Yeah.

16:32.951 --> 16:34.661
Okay. Okay, go, go.

16:34.703 --> 16:36.538
- Okay. All right.
- I'll see you tonight.

16:39.624 --> 16:41.751
Did you look everywhere
on that thing?

16:41.793 --> 16:43.253
Yes. Duh.

16:43.294 --> 16:44.671
Maybe take a load off

16:44.713 --> 16:47.841
and have a seat
on the upturned apple crate.

16:47.882 --> 16:49.467
No time! I'm in it to win it.

16:49.509 --> 16:52.303
Take a load off and sit down
on the obvious crate.

16:52.345 --> 16:55.014
Stop being weird
and leave me alone!

16:55.056 --> 16:58.184
God!

16:58.226 --> 16:59.519
Ugh...

17:01.855 --> 17:03.481
Yeah. Yeah, of course.

17:03.523 --> 17:05.692
I mean, the-the coverage
has been terrific, hasn't it?

17:05.734 --> 17:07.652
- Freeyond is trending
all over the country.

17:09.070 --> 17:11.072
No, I think
it's shaping up beautifully.

17:11.114 --> 17:13.533
No, no. I think we can relax.

17:15.535 --> 17:18.329
Uh, excuse me. What the hell's
going on back there?

17:18.371 --> 17:20.165
Oh, nothing, Dad!

17:20.206 --> 17:22.167
I'm sorry to bother you
while you're doing

17:22.208 --> 17:24.335
your important, precious work.

17:24.377 --> 17:26.230
-You know what? I'm gonna
have to call you back.
-Only, I've just

17:26.254 --> 17:27.881
been dumped.

17:27.922 --> 17:30.592
Well, can't say
I didn't predict that.

17:38.433 --> 17:41.060
Your maid is cleaning that up.

17:41.102 --> 17:42.520
Make her.

17:42.562 --> 17:44.147
Oh, you are such a baby!

17:44.189 --> 17:45.815
- Yes, a baby.
- Yeah.

17:45.857 --> 17:47.984
Who heard what you two were
planning and snuck back

17:48.026 --> 17:50.904
into the car and changed it
to "protect occupant."

17:50.945 --> 17:53.114
This baby did that.

17:53.156 --> 17:54.407
Are you fucking kidding me?

17:55.658 --> 17:57.827
You.

17:57.869 --> 17:59.662
Yeah, I'm really sorry, Daddy.

17:59.704 --> 18:03.333
I love him so much
and he broke my heart.

18:06.377 --> 18:10.048
The gloves are off now.

18:10.089 --> 18:11.841
Daddy...

18:11.883 --> 18:14.594
I think this is gonna be
really great for you.

18:14.636 --> 18:18.264
I never said anything, because
I didn't want to influence you,

18:18.306 --> 18:19.933
but I never liked Ingrid.

18:19.974 --> 18:22.936
Really? God, you hid it so well.

18:35.448 --> 18:39.410
And it looks like we have
an egg hunt winner.

18:41.454 --> 18:43.623
David Choak.

18:43.665 --> 18:47.252
That's good. He needs it.

18:50.004 --> 18:51.297
Oh, for fuck's sake.

18:51.339 --> 18:52.632
Thank you, Lucy.

18:52.674 --> 18:55.301
This is truly
a Winter's Day miracle.

18:55.343 --> 18:58.471
My father always said,
"Heaven showers its bounty

18:58.513 --> 19:00.098
"on the prosperous,

19:00.139 --> 19:02.851
and the wealthy are the most
worthy of His grace."

19:02.892 --> 19:04.853
This is for you, Father.

19:04.894 --> 19:08.231
And a thousand bucks
to my angel.

19:08.273 --> 19:10.441
Not bad.

19:16.948 --> 19:18.908
I better get bigger
in this update

19:18.950 --> 19:21.327
or I'm gonna kill my mom.

19:21.369 --> 19:24.455
Hey, maybe someone needs to get
a little bigger emotionally.

19:24.497 --> 19:26.708
I'm not paying extra for that.

19:47.812 --> 19:49.814
Wait, there's more.

20:01.451 --> 20:03.953
I hope there's apple Brown Betty
after the update.

20:03.995 --> 20:05.330
That would be dope.

20:24.474 --> 20:25.934
Cool.

20:25.975 --> 20:27.226
Lights out.

20:29.312 --> 20:31.356
Good night, Mr. Greenstein.

20:31.397 --> 20:33.232
Uh, sweet dreams, Ms. Kannerman.

20:58.424 --> 21:00.969
You have something
you want to say?

21:01.010 --> 21:02.595
How could you let Choak find it?

21:02.637 --> 21:05.139
Why didn't you help me?

21:05.181 --> 21:06.975
Sorry, what was that now?

21:07.016 --> 21:08.856
You get your cash either way
but I'm the one...

21:10.812 --> 21:13.231
Stop it!
Whose side are you...

21:13.272 --> 21:16.109
Sorry. Nighty-night.

21:16.150 --> 21:17.777
Bedtime

21:17.819 --> 21:18.987
for bit-boys.

21:19.028 --> 21:22.407
Shut down
those artificial brains.

21:22.448 --> 21:24.158
Shut them down.

21:56.566 --> 21:57.775
See you.

21:59.444 --> 22:00.820
Oh, God!

22:00.862 --> 22:02.530
You're still here?

22:02.572 --> 22:04.949
Yeah. So, where to now?

22:04.991 --> 22:06.200
My place?

22:06.242 --> 22:08.369
Uh, I don't think so.

22:08.411 --> 22:10.371
I don't get you.

22:10.413 --> 22:12.999
You've been blowing
hot and cold all night.

22:13.041 --> 22:15.585
I know. Please, don't be angry.

22:15.626 --> 22:19.422
Oh, I'm not angry.
Just confused and a little hurt.

22:19.464 --> 22:21.632
I care about you.

22:21.674 --> 22:23.551
About us.

22:23.593 --> 22:25.970
Well, there really isn't an us.

22:26.012 --> 22:27.889
'Cause we just hooked up
a few times.

22:27.930 --> 22:30.183
But there's a reason the
Nitely app kept matching us.

22:30.224 --> 22:33.102
And I gave you
your first orgasm.

22:33.144 --> 22:37.774
Oh, you gave me
your first female orgasm.

22:37.815 --> 22:39.817
They're not the same.

22:39.859 --> 22:41.444
I think we're meant
for each other.

22:41.486 --> 22:42.987
Wow.

22:44.989 --> 22:46.783
I don't agree.

22:46.824 --> 22:48.785
Oh.

22:48.826 --> 22:51.621
That's, um...

22:51.662 --> 22:54.290
Ouch.

22:54.332 --> 22:56.667
You know, for some reason,

22:56.709 --> 22:58.920
that's not making me want
to walk away from this.

22:58.961 --> 23:00.254
Oh, God.

23:00.296 --> 23:01.964
Oh, I'm not gonna stalk you.

23:02.006 --> 23:03.966
Don't worry.

23:04.008 --> 23:06.219
But I'm not gonna
give up hope, either.

23:06.260 --> 23:07.845
Look, I know how I feel,

23:07.887 --> 23:10.598
and I-I've never
felt this way before.

23:10.640 --> 23:12.809
- Mm-hmm. Got it. I got it.
- And that means something.

23:12.850 --> 23:16.687
So good night, and goodbye.

23:17.980 --> 23:19.816
For now.

23:19.857 --> 23:21.234
Okay, bye.

23:21.275 --> 23:23.027
- Oh. Yeah.
- You... Okay.

23:23.069 --> 23:24.278
Bye.

23:32.495 --> 23:35.081
All right, is that everyone?
You're all in here?

23:35.123 --> 23:36.290
Okay.

23:36.332 --> 23:37.834
Bye, Lucy.

23:37.875 --> 23:40.253
Great party.
Don't want these to go to waste.

23:40.294 --> 23:41.605
So yummy.
Wow, it is packed in there.

23:41.629 --> 23:43.840
I am gonna take the stairs.

23:43.881 --> 23:46.926
Oh, okay. Just make sure you're
downstairs for the head count.

23:46.968 --> 23:49.178
Okay.

23:49.220 --> 23:51.055

26:24.834 --> 26:26.043
Wake up.

26:27.211 --> 26:28.921
Wake up.

26:30.923 --> 26:34.302
Wake up!

26:34.343 --> 26:35.970
I'm up!

26:36.012 --> 26:37.555
Sorry.

26:37.596 --> 26:40.599
- How are you feeling?
- I'm tired.

26:41.851 --> 26:44.312
Come on, hang in there.

26:44.353 --> 26:46.147
Hey, hey, hey. Okay, okay.

26:46.188 --> 26:49.150
Easy. Little too much fun
with those.

26:49.191 --> 26:51.152
Well, don't you want
to find out everything?

26:51.193 --> 26:53.946
I mean, it's like the
Botox Babies finale times ten.

26:53.988 --> 26:55.948
And it didn't even happen to me.

26:55.990 --> 26:58.242
Yeah. Yeah, I need to know
if there's more to Jamie.

26:58.284 --> 27:00.119
I mean, I feel like
I can forgive him

27:00.161 --> 27:01.847
for the whole Ingrid thing,
but if he screwed me

27:01.871 --> 27:05.082
out of the business, I don't
think I can get past that.

27:05.124 --> 27:06.917
And what if he killed you?

27:06.959 --> 27:11.047
No. He was my best friend,
for a long time.

27:11.088 --> 27:12.715
I just can't believe that.

27:15.051 --> 27:18.846
Well, won't be long now.

27:18.888 --> 27:20.264
I'm gonna remember

27:20.306 --> 27:21.682
the shit out of my life,
you know?

27:21.724 --> 27:23.309
Figure it all out.

27:23.351 --> 27:25.353
It's gonna be awesome.

27:25.394 --> 27:27.396
I really think my work
could help people.

27:27.438 --> 27:30.483
You know? Like the 2Gigs.
That'd be cool.

27:42.536 --> 27:44.330
Wow.

27:44.372 --> 27:46.290
That's better than fireworks.

27:46.332 --> 27:47.917
Yeah.

28:10.731 --> 28:12.751
Hey! Hey! There's someone awake
on the fifth floor balcony!

28:12.775 --> 28:14.610
Who we got?

28:14.652 --> 28:16.404
- Oh, shit.
- Okay. Here.

28:22.243 --> 28:24.453
How did you learn
how to do that so fast?

28:24.495 --> 28:27.039
It's a good gift. Come here.

28:33.671 --> 28:36.048
Hmm. Must've been a glitch.

28:36.090 --> 28:37.842
Okay, boys. Turn down.

28:37.883 --> 28:39.718
Update's here.

28:47.059 --> 28:50.020
Whatever happens, I had this.

28:50.062 --> 28:53.232
I'll see you on the other side.

29:16.172 --> 29:17.882
What's going on?

29:19.508 --> 29:22.470
Um, I just have
to select something,

29:22.511 --> 29:26.307
but it just occurred to me
that you might wake up clean,

29:26.348 --> 29:28.309
and not remember anything
that happened to you

29:28.350 --> 29:29.852
in Lakeview so far.

29:29.894 --> 29:32.396
Like Luke or Dylan

29:32.438 --> 29:35.065
or me.

29:36.775 --> 29:39.236
No. No, I don't want
to do it, then.

29:39.278 --> 29:41.489
But you need to know this.

29:41.530 --> 29:43.949
Uh, let me, let me just...

29:55.336 --> 29:56.504
Nora?

29:58.255 --> 30:00.216
You should be good.

30:00.257 --> 30:03.469
You should get your self back.

30:06.263 --> 30:09.433
Restore memories
and force sleep.
