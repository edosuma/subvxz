00:01.067 --> 00:02.234
<i>Previously on "Alias. "</i>

00:02.235 --> 00:03.902
There.
You see that?

00:03.903 --> 00:06.071
No.

00:06.072 --> 00:08.039
What do you mean, no?
Look there.

00:08.041 --> 00:10.476
He's saying "Jewel" or "Julie. "

00:10.477 --> 00:12.077
Maybe "Julia. "

00:12.078 --> 00:13.445
Hello.

00:13.446 --> 00:15.946
Hello.

00:19.652 --> 00:22.152
Good to see you, Julia.

00:22.956 --> 00:24.456
Good to see you, too.

00:24.457 --> 00:25.824
We have another problem.

00:25.825 --> 00:27.159
What's that?

00:27.160 --> 00:29.660
Julia.

00:31.097 --> 00:33.597
I knew she couldn't be trusted.

00:34.567 --> 00:37.067
Vaughn's missing!

00:39.272 --> 00:40.339
This is what I meant.

00:40.340 --> 00:42.840
He's got CIA-issue equipment.

00:42.909 --> 00:45.409
Come here.

00:47.447 --> 00:49.415
Wait!

00:49.416 --> 00:51.916
I want to do it.

00:53.000 --> 00:59.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:00.960 --> 01:03.520
You never should have
betrayed me.

01:52.712 --> 01:53.979
This line is secure.

01:53.980 --> 01:56.381
Mountaineer, day code 78765,
requesting patch-through.

01:56.382 --> 01:57.516
Connected.

01:57.517 --> 01:59.518
This is the first time
I could call.

01:59.519 --> 02:00.786
Sydney, where are you?

02:00.787 --> 02:02.521
I'm in Spain, Dad.
Listen to me.

02:02.522 --> 02:03.922
They have to activate
the transmitter.

02:03.923 --> 02:06.325
I put it on Vaughn.
He's on a road outside Ibiza.

02:06.326 --> 02:08.759
We're supposed to be tracking
the biological weapons.

02:08.761 --> 02:10.195
Vaughn is bleeding to death.

02:10.196 --> 02:11.864
You have to move.

02:11.865 --> 02:12.865
Hold on.

02:12.866 --> 02:13.866
Flinkman.

02:13.867 --> 02:15.534
Trigger Sydney's
transmitter now.

02:15.535 --> 02:17.503
Yes, sir.

02:17.504 --> 02:18.904
Send Weiss after the signal.

02:18.905 --> 02:20.606
Okay, I'm on it.

02:20.607 --> 02:22.074
Marshall's activating it.

02:22.075 --> 02:23.408
Tell me what happened.

02:23.409 --> 02:24.510
They found Vaughn.

02:24.511 --> 02:27.742
They were gonna put a bullet in
his head, so I offered to do it.

02:27.814 --> 02:30.314
Dad, I stabbed him myself.
I had to.

02:30.350 --> 02:32.751
I didn't have a choice.
They were gonna kill him.

02:32.752 --> 02:34.186
We're tracking the signal.

02:34.187 --> 02:36.088
Tell me what happened
with the package.

02:36.089 --> 02:38.223
The biological weapons
are in Simon's room.

02:38.224 --> 02:41.557
He told me he's going somewhere
with Javier to celebrate.

02:41.628 --> 02:44.859
I'm gonna break into his room
and grab the weapons.

02:44.931 --> 02:47.399
We'll find Vaughn.

02:47.400 --> 02:49.900
Thank you.

03:06.252 --> 03:07.619
So, what's the rush?

03:07.620 --> 03:09.087
Timetable's moved up.

03:09.088 --> 03:11.588
That's all you need to know.

03:17.263 --> 03:19.763
Now, look at that.

03:19.766 --> 03:22.266
What's more beautiful than that?

03:22.535 --> 03:24.303
Perhaps what it pays for.

03:24.304 --> 03:27.068
Here. Cheers.

03:41.788 --> 03:43.522
Excellent.

03:43.523 --> 03:46.023
Biological weapons, please.

03:52.532 --> 03:55.990
It's rare that you find people
that do their job well.

03:57.170 --> 04:00.970
Even a thief can take
pride in his work, Mr. Sark.

04:01.774 --> 04:03.675
Well, here.

04:03.676 --> 04:06.176
Thank you.

05:44.110 --> 05:46.635
You know, this is trespassing.

05:48.281 --> 05:50.781
Surprise.

05:50.783 --> 05:52.751
I was looking for you.
Where did you go?

05:52.752 --> 05:54.119
I took a walk.

05:54.120 --> 05:56.620
I needed some air.

05:57.957 --> 06:00.551
It's not every night
I kill someone in the CIA.

06:00.626 --> 06:02.561
You know, if he was CIA,

06:02.562 --> 06:05.497
he certainly wasn't doing
his job very well.

06:05.965 --> 06:08.465
We already made the exchange.

06:09.435 --> 06:11.803
The Covenant already
picked up the weapons?

06:11.804 --> 06:13.071
Yeah.

06:13.072 --> 06:15.802
And they made payment.

06:18.778 --> 06:21.278
This is horrible.

06:21.280 --> 06:23.582
What?

06:23.583 --> 06:25.751
Well, I have a flight
later in the morning.

06:25.752 --> 06:27.352
I never wanted to leave less.

06:27.353 --> 06:28.687
You know that, don't you?

06:28.688 --> 06:30.956
I thought the exchange
was tomorrow.

06:30.957 --> 06:33.457
They moved up their schedule.

06:38.765 --> 06:40.365
When am I gonna see you again?

06:40.366 --> 06:42.866
I have so many questions.

06:43.202 --> 06:45.604
About what?

06:45.605 --> 06:48.105
Everything.

06:48.408 --> 06:49.541
Oh.

06:49.542 --> 06:53.069
Look, we work well together.

06:53.146 --> 06:54.146
I have your numbers.

06:54.147 --> 06:56.348
There's always
another job coming up.

06:56.349 --> 06:58.216
I'll call you.

06:58.217 --> 07:00.717
Okay?

07:03.556 --> 07:06.056
And feel free to use the room.

07:06.292 --> 07:08.792
Thanks.

07:17.837 --> 07:20.138
We're on the signal.
We're tracking him now.

07:20.139 --> 07:22.639
Vaughn!

07:23.009 --> 07:25.603
Oh, God.
I got him!

07:25.678 --> 07:27.112
I need the medic!

07:27.113 --> 07:28.213
Medic!

07:28.214 --> 07:29.981
Over here, quick!

07:29.982 --> 07:32.482
I need the medic!

07:37.623 --> 07:40.251
We found him.
He's in bad shape.

07:41.227 --> 07:43.727
They're working on him now.

08:48.094 --> 08:49.761
How is he?

08:49.762 --> 08:52.063
I don't know.

08:52.064 --> 08:53.965
No one does.

08:53.966 --> 08:56.935
"Critical but stable"
is the official term.

08:58.471 --> 08:59.971
Is he awake?

08:59.972 --> 09:02.472
No.

09:03.142 --> 09:05.642
He was hypoxic.

09:05.678 --> 09:08.943
He lost oxygen when the stab
wound collapsed his lung.

09:09.415 --> 09:12.179
They call it
tension pneumothorax.

09:13.686 --> 09:16.883
Which means they don't know
if he suffered brain damage.

09:20.059 --> 09:24.689
Lauren, I know that you've
been generally briefed,

09:24.764 --> 09:26.932
but I need to explain
the details myself

09:26.933 --> 09:29.959
so that you know
how this happened.

09:31.003 --> 09:34.666
A member of Walker's team
caught Michael.

09:34.740 --> 09:37.240
I still don't know how.

09:37.877 --> 09:39.678
Walker I.D.'d him as CIA.

09:39.679 --> 09:41.346
And stabbed him
and left him for dead.

09:41.347 --> 09:42.547
I already know all this.

09:42.548 --> 09:44.115
It's in the briefing.
Thank you.

09:44.116 --> 09:46.616
Lauren, that's not...

09:48.688 --> 09:51.486
Walker had a gun
to Michael's head.

09:51.557 --> 09:54.151
He was about to pull
the trigger.

09:54.226 --> 09:56.726
I took his knife.

09:57.630 --> 10:00.130
I stabbed Vaughn myself.

10:02.401 --> 10:03.535
You?

10:03.536 --> 10:05.837
Yes.
Walker was gonna murder him.

10:05.838 --> 10:07.138
So you stabbed him?

10:07.139 --> 10:09.374
I had no choice.

10:09.375 --> 10:11.576
It was the only thing I could
do to save Michael's life.

10:11.577 --> 10:14.077
Really?

10:14.146 --> 10:18.344
You cannot think that I would
have chosen to hurt him, ever.

10:18.684 --> 10:22.984
Michael might never
wake up from this.

10:31.697 --> 10:33.231
At 4:30 GMT,

10:33.232 --> 10:35.367
an imaging satellite picked up
the heat signature

10:35.368 --> 10:38.462
of a small aircraft
flying a tactical profile.

10:38.537 --> 10:40.739
The National Reconnaissance
Office tracked it

10:40.740 --> 10:43.174
to a maximum-security facility
in the Ural Mountains,

10:43.175 --> 10:45.010
where it flew multiple passes,

10:45.011 --> 10:47.809
deploying some kind
of a biological weapon.

10:47.880 --> 10:49.781
The weapon Sark picked up
in Spain?

10:49.782 --> 10:51.249
Most likely.

10:51.250 --> 10:53.980
Echelon intercepts between
the responding emergency teams

10:54.053 --> 10:56.421
indicate that the entire
prison population,

10:56.422 --> 11:00.859
300 guards, 500 prisoners,
died within minutes.

11:00.926 --> 11:02.293
There were no survivors?

11:02.294 --> 11:03.828
No, there was one.

11:03.829 --> 11:06.329
- One?
- Yeah.

11:07.733 --> 11:08.967
Kazari Bomani.

11:08.968 --> 11:10.268
Right, and as we all know,

11:10.269 --> 11:12.769
Bomani's become the largest
arms dealer in Africa.

11:12.772 --> 11:14.773
When authorities realized
a biological weapon

11:14.774 --> 11:15.774
had been deployed,

11:15.775 --> 11:19.142
they called in a hazmat team
to secure the facility.

11:20.379 --> 11:21.379
Sark.

11:21.380 --> 11:24.042
Bomani was being escorted
into a decontamination unit.

11:24.116 --> 11:26.880
- That's all we know.
- And how did Bomani survive?

11:26.952 --> 11:29.580
Actually, if I may,
I could shed some light

11:29.655 --> 11:31.923
on the situation, as usual.

11:31.924 --> 11:34.192
Marshall.

11:34.193 --> 11:37.253
Basically, Sark was able
to combine an Ebola strain

11:37.329 --> 11:39.497
with the bioweapon
he had stolen from Spain.

11:39.498 --> 11:42.956
We believe The Covenant tailored
the bioweapon to kill everybody

11:43.035 --> 11:44.769
except the person
whose genetic profile

11:44.770 --> 11:46.905
was encoded into the virus.

11:46.906 --> 11:49.007
- In this case, Bomani.
- Yeah.

11:49.008 --> 11:51.568
I mean, the whole thing's
pretty cool.

11:52.144 --> 11:55.671
In a sick, horrible way.

11:55.748 --> 11:58.410
Sloane is attending an MPO
conference in Mexico City.

11:58.484 --> 12:00.984
I have a briefing with him
the day after tomorrow.

12:00.986 --> 12:02.987
I'm still catching up.

12:02.988 --> 12:05.290
What did Sloane
have to do with this?

12:05.291 --> 12:07.919
Sloane gave us the intel
that led to Bomani's arrest.

12:07.993 --> 12:10.361
The subsequent dismantling
of his terror network

12:10.362 --> 12:13.126
wasn't one of the reasons
we agreed to pardon Sloane.

12:13.199 --> 12:15.233
It was the predominant reason.

12:15.234 --> 12:16.434
He might have a lead.

12:16.435 --> 12:18.870
Sydney, you'll accompany
Lauren to Mexico.

12:18.871 --> 12:21.371
That's it.

12:21.607 --> 12:23.608
She thinks I stabbed Vaughn
by choice.

12:23.609 --> 12:26.703
That I could have done something
else, that it was payback.

12:26.779 --> 12:30.545
When someone's spouse
is critically hurt or killed,

12:30.616 --> 12:33.176
rational thought takes time.

12:33.719 --> 12:34.719
I know.

12:34.720 --> 12:36.755
Tell me about Simon Walker.

12:36.756 --> 12:39.486
He's the only connection we have
to your missing years.

12:39.558 --> 12:41.526
We can't squander
this opportunity.

12:41.527 --> 12:43.361
Did he say anything else
to explain

12:43.362 --> 12:45.163
how he knew you as Julia?

12:45.164 --> 12:47.724
No, when he caught me,
he gave me the money and left.

12:47.800 --> 12:49.601
He didn't say
where he was going.

12:49.602 --> 12:52.730
Just that he would contact me
when another job came up.

12:52.805 --> 12:55.305
Another job.

12:55.808 --> 12:58.109
I'll contact Walker myself,
posing as a client.

12:58.110 --> 13:00.578
I'll spec out a job,
he'll assemble his team,

13:00.579 --> 13:02.347
and we'll take them
into custody.

13:02.348 --> 13:03.515
Once we have them,

13:03.516 --> 13:05.984
you and I will have
a face-to-face with Mr. Walker

13:05.985 --> 13:08.545
and find out everything
he knows about Julia.

13:09.622 --> 13:13.058
And, Sydney, about Vaughn.

13:14.960 --> 13:17.460
You know you did
the right thing.

13:17.997 --> 13:20.497
Thanks.

13:37.149 --> 13:39.317
Dixon told me about Michael.

13:39.318 --> 13:41.818
That he's off the ventilator.

13:42.087 --> 13:43.655
That's important.

13:43.656 --> 13:45.557
They're keeping him
in an induced coma

13:45.558 --> 13:46.791
for the next 36 hours

13:46.792 --> 13:49.292
to minimize
the chance of brain damage.

13:53.732 --> 13:56.929
Look, obviously it was
your intention

13:57.002 --> 13:59.170
to save Michael's life.

13:59.171 --> 14:01.606
I understand that.

14:01.607 --> 14:04.107
But I'm gonna be
honest with you.

14:04.376 --> 14:09.040
When I heard you were back,
I felt threatened.

14:09.381 --> 14:11.850
And I hated myself,
because I sympathize with you.

14:11.851 --> 14:14.252
With everything
you've gone through.

14:14.253 --> 14:15.987
But working together like this.

14:15.988 --> 14:18.488
The stakes of this job
are just too high.

14:18.557 --> 14:22.084
I can't work to the best of
my ability while I'm wondering

14:22.161 --> 14:25.426
whether I'm being polite enough
to my husband's ex-girlfriend.

14:25.497 --> 14:27.265
You don't need to be
polite with me.

14:27.266 --> 14:28.766
We're both past formalities.

14:28.767 --> 14:30.235
Well, good.

14:30.236 --> 14:32.736
Then I'll be blunt.

14:33.272 --> 14:37.333
I want you to request a transfer
to another field office.

14:39.612 --> 14:42.112
Lauren, everyone I know.

14:42.481 --> 14:44.816
All of the people
I have left in my life,

14:44.817 --> 14:52.019
my friends, my father,
work at that office.

14:53.225 --> 14:56.626
I thought it would be best
if the request came from you.

14:57.696 --> 15:01.962
I know we're being blunt,
but was that a threat?

15:04.270 --> 15:06.898
You don't have the authority
to have me transferred.

15:06.972 --> 15:08.973
The NSC will support me

15:08.974 --> 15:11.009
when they learn
that our working together

15:11.010 --> 15:14.309
is compromising the fight
against The Covenant.

15:14.680 --> 15:17.774
If you don't make the call,
I will.

15:35.434 --> 15:37.934
Excuse me, mate,
you got the time?

15:38.137 --> 15:39.871
My watch is broken.

15:39.872 --> 15:42.372
Never buy American.

15:43.175 --> 15:47.509
So tell me, Mr. Warner,
how'd you learn to contact me?

15:47.579 --> 15:49.580
We have a mutual acquaintance.

15:49.581 --> 15:51.649
Julia Thorne.

15:51.650 --> 15:53.017
Really?

15:53.018 --> 15:55.386
Oh, I love her.

15:55.387 --> 15:57.887
Yes.

15:57.990 --> 15:59.590
So, what's the gig?

15:59.591 --> 16:03.391
A fuel-cell automobile
has been designed in Japan.

16:03.462 --> 16:05.930
The prototype was placed
on a cargo freighter.

16:05.931 --> 16:09.162
It left Niigata this morning
bound for Hong Kong.

16:09.234 --> 16:11.035
I want you to steal it.

16:11.036 --> 16:13.536
Oh, sexy.

16:13.706 --> 16:16.766
How long will it take you
to put your team together?

16:17.176 --> 16:19.804
Oh, well, the question is,
can you afford for me

16:19.878 --> 16:21.245
to put my team together?

16:21.246 --> 16:24.579
Don't concern yourself
with my finances.

16:24.650 --> 16:27.744
I wouldn't have come to you
if I couldn't overpay.

16:27.820 --> 16:29.854
Nobody ever overpays with me.

16:29.855 --> 16:31.456
Yes.

16:31.457 --> 16:34.017
Julia says you're the best.

16:35.661 --> 16:37.362
I'll contact you
regarding the price

16:37.363 --> 16:39.731
and the location
of our next meeting.

16:39.732 --> 16:42.701
You know, with all the specs
regarding the shipment.

16:42.768 --> 16:45.268
Naturally.

16:45.871 --> 16:46.871
Cheers.

16:46.872 --> 16:49.372
Good night.

17:10.929 --> 17:13.429
Sign in, please.

17:18.103 --> 17:20.603
We're here to see Arvin Sloane.

17:20.739 --> 17:22.906
Oh, perfect timing.

17:22.907 --> 17:25.407
He's just arriving.

17:38.457 --> 17:40.957
Get in the van!

18:10.789 --> 18:13.289
Get in!

18:22.301 --> 18:23.668
Have you done this before?

18:23.669 --> 18:25.169
I cross-trained at The Farm.

18:25.170 --> 18:27.934
- Are you field-rated?
- No.

18:41.120 --> 18:44.453
Kazari, you're thinking
that I'm responsible

18:44.523 --> 18:47.023
for your imprisonment.

18:55.801 --> 18:56.868
Hello?

18:56.869 --> 18:57.935
Julia?

18:57.936 --> 18:58.903
Simon?

18:58.904 --> 19:00.938
I've got another job for us.

19:00.939 --> 19:03.439
Really?
That's great.

19:03.442 --> 19:04.942
You sound distracted.

19:04.943 --> 19:07.443
I'm kind of in the middle
of something.

19:08.180 --> 19:10.448
Look, are you available
for another job?

19:10.449 --> 19:13.282
- For you, I am always available.
- Can't that wait?

19:13.352 --> 19:14.785
Simon, can I call you back?

19:14.786 --> 19:17.286
Sure, baby.
Okay.

19:22.561 --> 19:24.262
They're gaining on us.

19:24.263 --> 19:26.763
Tell the chase car
to take them out.

19:32.604 --> 19:33.771
Don't look in the mirror.

19:33.772 --> 19:35.540
All that matters
is what's in front of us.

19:35.541 --> 19:37.041
I think there's
somebody back there.

19:56.895 --> 19:58.095
- Hit the brakes!
- What?

19:58.096 --> 20:00.596
Hit the brakes
and cut right, now!

20:09.808 --> 20:12.333
Go!
Go, go, go, go!

20:17.649 --> 20:19.083
They're still coming.

20:19.084 --> 20:21.584
Through the alley.
Go!

20:22.955 --> 20:24.822
- There's no room.
- I can make it.

20:24.823 --> 20:25.523
- Back off.
- No.

20:25.524 --> 20:28.024
Wait, Lauren, go around!

20:41.573 --> 20:44.073
Damn it!

20:49.348 --> 20:51.848
I thought we were partners.

20:53.719 --> 20:57.052
I thought we had an association.

20:58.824 --> 21:01.324
I was wrong.

21:04.096 --> 21:09.398
One day when I was a boy
in Juah Town, the tanks came.

21:10.369 --> 21:13.395
The soldiers wandered up
and killed all the men.

21:13.472 --> 21:15.972
Raped the women.

21:17.576 --> 21:21.603
My mother, Mr. Sloane,
was raped.

21:22.648 --> 21:27.483
And then she was killed
in front of me.

21:27.552 --> 21:30.052
In front of my brothers.

21:31.523 --> 21:35.789
My oldest brother threatened me,
insisted I do nothing.

21:35.861 --> 21:39.524
But he couldn't help himself.

21:40.632 --> 21:43.132
He tried to fight them.

21:43.168 --> 21:45.668
The soldiers cut off his arm.

21:46.505 --> 21:49.005
Imagine it for me.

21:49.775 --> 21:52.437
Watching your own mother
get raped.

21:52.944 --> 21:55.444
Watching her cut.

21:56.014 --> 21:58.514
Screaming.

21:58.550 --> 22:01.050
Can you even begin to do that?

22:03.455 --> 22:06.982
I swore that I will never
be powerless again.

22:08.493 --> 22:12.953
That I would do anything
to protect my family.

22:15.534 --> 22:19.595
And that anyone who got
in the way of that

22:19.671 --> 22:23.129
would suffer the same fate
as my brother.

22:25.877 --> 22:30.211
Yes, I turned you in,
as you would have done me.

22:31.683 --> 22:34.085
Why?

22:34.086 --> 22:37.544
To obtain what you now need.

22:38.457 --> 22:40.858
Legitimacy.

22:40.859 --> 22:42.827
In a nutshell, Mr. Bomani,

22:42.828 --> 22:47.663
I could help you become
more powerful than ever.

23:00.379 --> 23:02.780
Sloane was responsible
for Bomani's imprisonment.

23:02.781 --> 23:04.548
Sark breaks Bomani out of jail.

23:04.549 --> 23:06.217
The first thing they do
is get Sloane.

23:06.218 --> 23:07.585
Hopefully,
Bomani's got his revenge,

23:07.586 --> 23:10.248
and Sloane is either
in incredible pain or dead.

23:10.322 --> 23:13.416
I want a full options briefing
in my office, one hour.

23:15.527 --> 23:17.395
You start with your contacts
in Washington.

23:17.396 --> 23:18.963
I'll check in
with Strategic Services.

23:18.964 --> 23:21.464
Sydney.

23:23.568 --> 23:25.536
What I said about requesting
you transferred

23:25.537 --> 23:28.301
to another field office
wasn't my place.

23:28.907 --> 23:32.809
And it's hard, but I'd
really like this to work.

23:33.678 --> 23:36.178
I appreciate you saying that.

23:59.504 --> 24:02.004
Syd?

24:02.574 --> 24:04.975
Hey.

24:04.976 --> 24:07.476
Oh, my God.

24:08.747 --> 24:11.247
Vaughn.

24:14.152 --> 24:16.652
Where am I?

24:16.721 --> 24:19.221
You're home.

24:20.192 --> 24:22.426
You stabbed me.

24:22.427 --> 24:24.595
I'm sorry.

24:24.596 --> 24:26.864
I had no choice.
Walker would have killed you.

24:26.865 --> 24:29.365
I know.

24:32.070 --> 24:34.570
You're okay?

24:35.173 --> 24:37.733
I was so afraid I'd lost you.

24:41.980 --> 24:44.480
I'm right here.

24:49.221 --> 24:51.555
Leaving you like that,

24:51.556 --> 24:53.524
not knowing if I'd ever
see you again,

24:53.525 --> 24:56.585
made me realize
how much I miss you.

24:59.397 --> 25:01.897
I miss you, too.

25:04.069 --> 25:06.569
You do?

25:25.490 --> 25:27.291
How could you do this to me?

25:32.731 --> 25:35.231
Hi.

25:40.438 --> 25:43.407
Sweetheart, you're okay.

25:45.143 --> 25:47.643
Do you remember me?

25:48.413 --> 25:50.014
Of course.

25:50.015 --> 25:52.515
Thank God.

26:13.338 --> 26:14.705
Hey, Syd.

26:14.706 --> 26:16.006
- Marshall, hey.
- Hi.

26:16.007 --> 26:17.808
I'm going to the hospital.
Vaughn's awake.

26:17.809 --> 26:19.076
It's the best news ever.

26:19.077 --> 26:20.644
I was hoping you could tell him

26:20.645 --> 26:23.145
that the topical application
of magnets can influence

26:23.181 --> 26:24.848
the electrochemical processes.

26:24.849 --> 26:26.150
He needs to know this why?

26:26.151 --> 26:27.585
Oh, sorry.
Buried the lead.

26:27.586 --> 26:28.819
It's for pain relief.

26:28.820 --> 26:30.321
Having a collapsed lung...

26:30.322 --> 26:31.855
Syd, you're not gonna
believe this.

26:31.856 --> 26:34.450
They found Sloane. His plane
just landed in Van Nuys.

26:34.526 --> 26:36.827
They've taken him
to our facility in Riverside.

26:36.828 --> 26:39.328
He's asking to speak with you.

26:41.366 --> 26:45.063
Oh, listen, let's not tell
Mr. Sloane about the magnets.

26:54.512 --> 26:55.746
What have I missed?

26:55.747 --> 26:59.239
I was just thanking Ms. Reed
for the attempted rescue.

26:59.351 --> 27:01.652
I appreciate your efforts
a great deal.

27:01.653 --> 27:03.721
Did you escape?

27:03.722 --> 27:06.486
No, Mr. Bomani let me go.

27:06.992 --> 27:09.492
He let you go?

27:09.527 --> 27:12.325
He just let you walk
right out the door?

27:12.697 --> 27:15.197
Yes.

27:15.367 --> 27:17.867
What did you offer him?

27:18.870 --> 27:20.871
Well, I gave him information

27:20.872 --> 27:23.534
that I eventually
was going to share with you.

27:24.743 --> 27:31.273
My contacts within
the Japanese mob, the Yakuza,

27:31.349 --> 27:34.841
have developed the first
A.I. Computer virus.

27:35.687 --> 27:39.020
It probes networks, analyzes
systems, and then writes itself.

27:39.090 --> 27:41.786
Creates its own subviruses.

27:42.594 --> 27:44.795
In the wrong hands,
it can crash markets,

27:44.796 --> 27:48.027
destroy banks,
shut down transportation,

27:48.099 --> 27:51.227
bring military installations
to a halt.

27:51.302 --> 27:53.802
You're telling us
you gave this information

27:53.872 --> 27:56.397
to a man who's working
with The Covenant?

27:56.474 --> 28:02.106
Now I'm giving it to you so
that you can disable the virus

28:02.213 --> 28:04.713
before The Covenant gets it.

28:05.250 --> 28:07.878
And I mean disable it,
not destroy it.

28:08.953 --> 28:12.389
Because if Bomani comes to
the Yakuza facility in Osaka

28:12.457 --> 28:14.858
and finds that the virus
has been destroyed,

28:14.859 --> 28:17.027
he will know I tipped you off
and have me killed.

28:17.028 --> 28:19.826
So, Sydney, Lauren.

28:22.267 --> 28:24.767
My life is in your hands.

28:25.870 --> 28:28.600
You've told Bomani
you'd work for The Covenant?

28:28.673 --> 28:30.207
Yes.

28:30.208 --> 28:33.871
Now I'm telling you that I'm in
a position to be a double agent.

28:33.945 --> 28:38.041
Working for The Covenant,
but loyal to the CIA.

28:38.116 --> 28:40.616
What is it, Sydney?

28:41.286 --> 28:42.920
This is classic.

28:42.921 --> 28:45.421
Don't take my word for it.

28:45.690 --> 28:49.217
Have Marshall analyze the video
he's making of me right now.

28:51.129 --> 28:53.564
Why don't you examine
the lie detectors

28:53.565 --> 28:55.733
you're running on my voice?

28:55.734 --> 28:58.234
I promise you.

28:58.403 --> 29:01.998
He'll verify that I am telling
the God's honest truth.

29:05.877 --> 29:08.278
Now, as far as our technology
can detect,

29:08.279 --> 29:11.077
and these are next-gen tests,
as high-end as it gets.

29:11.149 --> 29:12.950
He's not lying, folks.

29:12.951 --> 29:16.079
If there's someone who can fool
those tests, it's Sloane.

29:16.154 --> 29:19.954
In theory, yes, but in practice,
he'd really have to be using

29:20.024 --> 29:23.050
the next gen's next-gen
lie-detector-defeating tech,

29:23.128 --> 29:25.961
which, frankly,
even I can't imagine.

29:26.030 --> 29:28.198
What do we do here?
Do we trust Sloane?

29:28.199 --> 29:29.800
The position of the NSC

29:29.801 --> 29:31.502
is that we accept
Sloane's proposal

29:31.503 --> 29:34.233
and use him as a double agent
within The Covenant.

29:34.305 --> 29:36.206
Just so that
someone has said it.

29:36.207 --> 29:38.707
In the past two years,
Sloane has obtained a pardon

29:38.710 --> 29:41.440
based mainly on the capture
of a criminal who is now free.

29:41.513 --> 29:43.213
In addition,
Sloane will be allowed

29:43.214 --> 29:45.482
to openly participate
in Covenant activities

29:45.483 --> 29:48.247
based on the promise he will
inform us of those activities.

29:48.319 --> 29:50.844
One could argue he's pulled off
the con job of the century.

29:50.922 --> 29:54.323
It also appears that Bomani will
kill Sloane if we interfere.

29:54.392 --> 29:55.959
Who would lose sleep over that?

29:55.960 --> 29:57.494
The U.S. Government
would have lost

29:57.495 --> 30:00.293
its most valuable source
of underworld intelligence.

30:00.365 --> 30:02.766
The fact that Sloane
holds all the cards

30:02.767 --> 30:04.168
is giving me a migraine.

30:04.169 --> 30:06.669
According to Sloane,
Sark and Bomani are on their way

30:06.738 --> 30:08.438
to a Yakuza-run casino in Osaka,

30:08.439 --> 30:11.135
where they will download
the virus from a secure server.

30:11.209 --> 30:13.010
Marshall will provide a program

30:13.011 --> 30:15.844
that will rewrite the virus
and render it unusable.

30:15.914 --> 30:16.914
Sorry to interrupt.

30:16.915 --> 30:18.549
I did say that I could do that,

30:18.550 --> 30:21.348
but not if I haven't
seen the code.

30:21.786 --> 30:24.949
I guess this means
I'm going on another mission.

30:25.023 --> 30:26.690
If you sanction it.

30:26.691 --> 30:30.593
I'll have Strategic Services
devise a scenario for you both.

30:30.662 --> 30:32.129
Actually, another suggestion

30:32.130 --> 30:34.894
for the CIA suggestion box,
which is a great idea.

30:34.966 --> 30:35.866
Marshall.

30:35.867 --> 30:36.867
Sorry.

30:36.868 --> 30:40.133
What I was thinking is
a surefire way to get invited

30:40.205 --> 30:42.833
into the back room
of a Yakuza casino.

30:43.241 --> 30:45.475
Get caught cheating at gambling.

30:45.476 --> 30:47.911
Yeah, I have
a little something here.

30:47.912 --> 30:50.314
This will give us an example
of what I mean.

30:50.315 --> 30:53.546
Now, in high school,

30:53.618 --> 30:57.520
by applying the methodology
of statistical probability,

30:57.589 --> 31:01.320
accounting for the continuous
random variable of luck,

31:01.392 --> 31:02.893
I was able to come up

31:02.894 --> 31:05.362
with a fairly effective
card-counting technique.

31:05.363 --> 31:07.564
You know how to deal
a hand of blackjack?

31:07.565 --> 31:09.566
Yes, Marshall.

31:09.567 --> 31:11.134
Go ahead.
Deal one for yourself.

31:11.135 --> 31:12.970
Can I get a cocktail?

31:12.971 --> 31:14.771
Five, six.

31:14.772 --> 31:16.273
Hit there.
Hit me there.

31:16.274 --> 31:18.242
Stick there.

31:18.243 --> 31:19.343
Hit me twice here.

31:19.344 --> 31:20.811
Double down there.

31:20.812 --> 31:21.979
Stick.

31:21.980 --> 31:24.114
Hit me once there.

31:24.115 --> 31:26.383
You're gonna have
a face card under there.

31:26.384 --> 31:29.512
Go ahead and turn that over.
That gives you 17.

31:29.587 --> 31:32.385
Look at that.
I've won nine times.

31:32.457 --> 31:33.790
Wow.

31:33.791 --> 31:37.124
I had a lot of free time
in high school.

31:39.230 --> 31:42.063
Michael's doctors expect
he'll be released tomorrow.

31:42.133 --> 31:44.268
If there's time,
you should go and see him.

31:44.269 --> 31:45.702
I know he'd like that.

31:45.703 --> 31:47.004
Thank you.

31:47.005 --> 31:49.633
I don't know if there will be,
but thank you.

31:49.707 --> 31:52.207
When you get back, then.

31:57.215 --> 31:59.715
Thank you for meeting me.

32:01.753 --> 32:03.053
Please.

32:03.054 --> 32:04.454
After your excellent work,

32:04.455 --> 32:06.955
you more than deserve
the professional courtesy.

32:06.958 --> 32:08.825
Unfortunately,
we have to be brief.

32:08.826 --> 32:11.161
I'm catching a plane to Osaka.

32:11.162 --> 32:12.729
We've taken on a new client.

32:12.730 --> 32:14.698
He says his name
is Gilbert Warner.

32:14.699 --> 32:16.099
Corporate and personal
tax returns

32:16.100 --> 32:19.035
confirm he's the CEO
of Rodgers Automotive.

32:19.637 --> 32:21.405
But he knows how to lose a tail.

32:21.406 --> 32:22.906
I think he's a pro.

32:22.907 --> 32:24.908
I'd like some more
detailed background.

32:24.909 --> 32:27.010
Would you mind running
the check?

32:27.011 --> 32:29.511
I don't believe I have to.

32:30.014 --> 32:32.514
His name is Jack Bristow.

32:32.550 --> 32:35.050
He's CIA.

32:45.596 --> 32:48.292
Enter your account password,
and within 90 seconds,

32:48.366 --> 32:51.426
you'll receive confirmation
of an electronic transfer

32:51.502 --> 32:54.494
in the amount of $3 million.

32:59.911 --> 33:02.045
You don't mind if I ask you
to look away?

33:02.046 --> 33:04.546
Of course not.

33:10.521 --> 33:13.021
Excuse me.

33:13.591 --> 33:15.125
Yeah.

33:15.126 --> 33:16.693
You're being set up.

33:16.694 --> 33:19.062
The man you're standing with
is a CIA operative.

33:19.063 --> 33:20.197
His name is Jack Bristow.

33:20.198 --> 33:22.599
I hope you appreciate
hearing this as much as I do.

33:22.600 --> 33:27.697
His daughter, Sydney Bristow,
also CIA, goes by an alias.

33:27.772 --> 33:29.373
Julia Thorne.

33:29.374 --> 33:30.574
Great news, mate.

33:30.575 --> 33:33.075
Mr. Warner will be happy
to hear it.

33:34.712 --> 33:36.413
Hear what?

33:36.414 --> 33:38.281
The team's been assembled.

33:38.282 --> 33:41.376
As soon as the money's
transferred, we're in business.

33:42.987 --> 33:45.683
You know, while we're waiting,

33:45.757 --> 33:48.453
you never told me
how you met Julia.

33:48.926 --> 33:53.363
Are you, like,
lovers or something?

33:54.365 --> 33:56.633
No, not exactly.

33:56.634 --> 33:58.869
I ask because if you ever
get the chance,

33:58.870 --> 34:01.370
I highly recommend it.

34:01.739 --> 34:02.873
Do you?

34:02.874 --> 34:05.175
Oh, yeah, man.

34:05.176 --> 34:07.872
On a scale of one to 10,

34:07.945 --> 34:11.141
10 being the most degenerate
displays of sexual theater

34:11.215 --> 34:14.309
known to man...

34:14.385 --> 34:16.885
Julia's like a 17.

34:20.123 --> 34:22.623
You have your money.

34:24.195 --> 34:26.789
As soon as the job's done,
we'll be in contact.

34:41.145 --> 34:43.645
You shot me.

34:43.748 --> 34:46.248
You shot me.

34:46.951 --> 34:48.985
You bastard.

34:48.985 --> 34:51.784
Listen to me very closely.
You're dying.

34:51.856 --> 34:54.824
I'm the only one who can get you
to a hospital in time.

34:54.891 --> 34:56.393
Tell me about Julia.

34:56.393 --> 34:58.662
Where you met her.
How you knew her.

34:58.663 --> 35:03.430
I wasn't kidding
about screwing your daughter.

35:03.468 --> 35:05.769
She's the wildest girl
I ever had.

35:05.770 --> 35:08.762
Tell me about Julia
if you want to live.

35:08.840 --> 35:14.642
You want to know
how she likes it?

36:16.007 --> 36:18.507
Howdy.

36:21.946 --> 36:23.380
If I were any more nervous,

36:23.381 --> 36:25.881
I'd need new underpants
just about now.

36:28.786 --> 36:30.754
I think I'm allergic
to this moustache.

36:30.755 --> 36:32.155
I think it's cat fur.

36:32.156 --> 36:33.957
Just relax, honey.

36:33.958 --> 36:36.950
I'm just about to cheat at cards
at a casino run by gangsters.

36:37.028 --> 36:39.129
I just want to keep
my pinky fingers.

36:39.130 --> 36:41.565
We talked about this
on the plane.

36:41.566 --> 36:44.066
I need to know you can do this.

36:48.406 --> 36:49.940
Let's play cards.

36:49.941 --> 36:53.172
<i># You got to know
when to hold 'em #</i>

36:53.244 --> 36:54.744
<i># Know when to fold 'em #</i>

36:54.745 --> 36:55.779
<i># Soundbwoys #</i>

36:55.780 --> 36:58.181
<i># Know when to walk away #</i>

36:58.182 --> 36:59.816
<i># Know when to run #</i>

36:59.817 --> 37:02.547
<i># You got to count
your dub plates #</i>

37:02.620 --> 37:04.854
<i># Before you touch
the turntable #</i>

37:04.855 --> 37:07.881
<i># 'Cause if you run out
of big tunes #</i>

37:07.959 --> 37:10.459
<i># That means your sound
is done #</i>

37:11.762 --> 37:13.730
<i># Get the hell up! #</i>

37:13.731 --> 37:15.465
<i># 'Clef said get the hell up! #</i>

37:15.466 --> 37:17.000
<i># Throw your hands in the sky #</i>

37:17.001 --> 37:18.969
<i># Yo, this combination
gonna bust from #</i>

37:18.970 --> 37:20.470
<i># Craps, y'all, whassup? #</i>

37:20.471 --> 37:22.339
<i># No disrespect to Soundbwoy #</i>

37:22.340 --> 37:24.840
<i># But you better step away
from me #</i>

37:24.842 --> 37:27.572
<i># Easily defeat measly M. C. S
and tease you #</i>

37:27.645 --> 37:29.713
<i># Ease back, squeeze two in
your wig and breeze through #</i>

37:29.714 --> 37:31.648
<i># You got to know
when to hold 'em #</i>

37:31.649 --> 37:33.717
<i># Y'all know the name,
same assassin from before #</i>

37:33.718 --> 37:36.019
<i># But the beat
just changed a little #</i>

37:36.020 --> 37:38.355
<i># New flip flows, that got
women in they thongs #</i>

37:38.356 --> 37:40.290
<i># Gettin' it on,
but not Sisqo #</i>

37:40.291 --> 37:41.691
I'll tell you something.

37:41.692 --> 37:43.760
Can you get somebody
to help me with this?

37:43.761 --> 37:44.928
I can't carry all this.

37:44.929 --> 37:47.429
Yes, we can!

37:47.498 --> 37:49.733
You are very lucky.

37:49.734 --> 37:51.134
Oh, are you talking to me?

37:51.135 --> 37:53.169
Well, thank you very much.
I am lucky.

37:53.170 --> 37:55.670
I'm lucky to be born in Texas,
and I am rich enough

37:55.673 --> 37:58.540
that a woman this beautiful
is willing to share my bed.

37:58.643 --> 38:00.443
Come on!

38:00.444 --> 38:02.612
Perhaps you might
come into the back.

38:02.613 --> 38:04.981
I can convert your winnings
into diamonds,

38:04.982 --> 38:07.050
or simply make
an electronic transfer

38:07.051 --> 38:08.518
to the bank of your choice.

38:08.519 --> 38:10.153
That would be mighty hospitable.

38:10.154 --> 38:12.188
<i>Domo arigato, Mr...</i>

38:12.189 --> 38:15.158
What is that?
Tomosaka.

38:15.226 --> 38:16.726
We'll take care of that.

38:16.727 --> 38:18.762
You're gonna take care of it?
Thank you.

38:18.763 --> 38:20.930
Mr. Tomosaka,
we weren't cheating.

38:20.931 --> 38:22.499
No, we weren't cheating.

38:22.500 --> 38:25.000
You were counting cards.

38:25.670 --> 38:27.771
Are you gonna cut off
your finger with that?

38:27.772 --> 38:30.639
'Cause that looks mighty big
to take off a pinky.

38:30.708 --> 38:32.776
I will take your hand!

38:32.777 --> 38:35.277
Don't hurt him!

38:43.120 --> 38:45.620
Put them in the closet.

38:50.961 --> 38:53.296
Okay.

38:53.297 --> 38:54.764
What was the password
Sloane gave you?

38:54.765 --> 38:57.265
Ravenson 327.

38:58.769 --> 39:01.863
Okay, okay, I found the virus.
God, the code on this thing.

39:01.939 --> 39:03.306
It's gonna take me a second

39:03.307 --> 39:06.208
to download a copy before I
can render the virus unusable.

39:08.512 --> 39:10.480
You're gonna have to hurry.

39:10.481 --> 39:12.981
Sark's here.

39:15.953 --> 39:18.453
Come on!

39:23.127 --> 39:25.627
It's disabled.

39:36.273 --> 39:39.242
It'll take me a second to
transfer a copy to our server.

39:52.022 --> 39:54.522
Done.

40:01.365 --> 40:03.865
Sorry.

40:04.835 --> 40:07.335
<i># Ay, ay #</i>

40:07.538 --> 40:10.038
<i># Sweetness #</i>

40:10.174 --> 40:12.475
<i># Hey #</i>

40:12.476 --> 40:13.843
<i># Lady listeners #</i>

40:13.844 --> 40:15.245
Vaughn will back me up.

40:15.246 --> 40:16.946
This is a true story, I swear.

40:16.947 --> 40:19.048
Sophomore year, college.

40:19.049 --> 40:20.417
Her name was April First.

40:20.418 --> 40:21.584
Birth name, by the way.

40:21.585 --> 40:23.620
Right. And for a month,
I was obsessed.

40:23.621 --> 40:26.749
I thought this woman had
to have my children, okay?

40:26.824 --> 40:30.021
The problem was that she only
dated guitar players. Literally.

40:30.094 --> 40:31.761
A girl should have
her standards.

40:31.762 --> 40:33.196
Since she worked
at a coffeehouse,

40:33.197 --> 40:35.632
Eric decided to impress her
on open-mike night.

40:35.633 --> 40:36.933
You play the guitar?

40:36.934 --> 40:39.202
No, no, not even a little.

40:39.203 --> 40:42.434
But I thought that, you know,
if I got up on that stage

40:42.506 --> 40:44.307
and the spotlight
was in my face,

40:44.308 --> 40:46.808
that maybe God
would imbue my hands

40:46.877 --> 40:48.711
with the power of
Stevie Ray Vaughn.

40:48.712 --> 40:49.979
So what happened?

40:49.980 --> 40:51.114
Oh, disaster.

40:51.115 --> 40:52.449
Just embarrassment.

40:52.450 --> 40:54.950
I didn't play two notes
that went together.

40:54.952 --> 40:56.553
And what about April First?

40:56.554 --> 40:58.254
Oh, we made out in my Gremlin.

40:58.255 --> 40:59.289
You did what?

40:59.290 --> 41:01.224
Yeah. She got to work
late that night.

41:01.225 --> 41:04.661
All she saw was me coming out
with a guitar under my arm.

41:04.728 --> 41:05.995
Ow.

41:05.996 --> 41:07.397
Is that a good idea?

41:07.398 --> 41:09.532
If I have to hear that story
for the fifth time,

41:09.533 --> 41:10.900
I'm gonna need it.

41:10.901 --> 41:12.302
Feeling okay?

41:12.303 --> 41:14.070
Okay.
Yeah, unlike this guy,

41:14.071 --> 41:16.665
who took six months to sit up
after he got shot.

41:16.740 --> 41:18.541
I was shot in the jugular.

41:18.542 --> 41:21.042
I was. I was unconscious
for three weeks.

41:21.045 --> 41:22.412
And don't come crying to me

41:22.413 --> 41:24.581
if beer starts spraying out
of your chest.

41:24.582 --> 41:26.182
Don't you have to get up early?

41:26.183 --> 41:27.650
Yes, I do.

41:27.651 --> 41:30.151
All right.
Good night, everybody.

41:30.154 --> 41:31.321
Can I grab a ride?

41:31.322 --> 41:33.822
Yeah.

41:37.761 --> 41:39.262
Good night.

41:39.263 --> 41:41.763
See you tomorrow.

41:43.901 --> 41:45.835
<i># Ooh, child #</i>

41:45.836 --> 41:49.169

41:49.240 --> 41:53.677
<i># Ooh, child,

41:53.744 --> 41:56.112
Yeah. Wait, you know what?
I forgot my jacket.

41:56.113 --> 41:57.514
All right.
I'll get the car.

41:57.515 --> 42:00.015
Okay.
