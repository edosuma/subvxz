01:39.182 --> 01:40.516
It's already 8:20.

01:40.600 --> 01:42.436
I'm supposed to report to work
in 40 minutes.

01:42.519 --> 01:45.732
- Where's work?
- Downtown L.A. Be careful.

01:45.815 --> 01:48.652
It's rush hour. Take you half that long
just to get to the freeway.

01:48.736 --> 01:51.364
Great. Is that's the last of it
except the piano?

01:51.781 --> 01:54.493
Good. 'Cause I'm really
in a hurry. Come on.

01:57.414 --> 01:59.167
Tough all over, guys!

02:04.215 --> 02:05.884
Where'd he come from?

02:07.303 --> 02:10.598
No idea, must've escaped
from a zoo or something.

02:13.936 --> 02:15.606
I can't believe it.

02:31.376 --> 02:33.212
I bet he's worth some money.

02:34.923 --> 02:36.508
Here, monkey.

02:37.384 --> 02:38.720
Come on, fella.

02:39.512 --> 02:40.889
Come to Uncle Max.

02:43.726 --> 02:45.395
Hey! What are you doing?

02:45.645 --> 02:48.399
Don't chase him!
You're just making him run.

02:50.527 --> 02:52.696
- Come on, have a banana!
- Come back.

02:53.990 --> 02:55.283
Come here!

02:59.414 --> 03:00.999
Come back here.

03:03.502 --> 03:04.922
Look out!

03:06.965 --> 03:08.134
Oh, no!

03:13.182 --> 03:15.560
Why did you guys have to chase him?

03:37.423 --> 03:40.093
How come he isn't lying there
in 100 little pieces?

03:40.177 --> 03:42.221
That's a very good question.

03:45.935 --> 03:48.855
I think he just said,
"Welcome to L.A.," lady...

05:26.026 --> 05:27.278
You're Prince?

05:27.695 --> 05:30.324
Diana Prince. You must be Dale Hawthorn.

05:32.451 --> 05:34.454
So you're the agent
Washington summoned?

05:34.537 --> 05:38.877
Listen, I'm sorry I'm late, but between
moving into my new house and trying to-

05:40.462 --> 05:42.256
Is something wrong?

05:44.258 --> 05:48.348
Last week the guys in the lab put
sandpaper in my salami sandwiches.

05:48.431 --> 05:49.682
You wanna do me a favor?

05:49.766 --> 05:52.561
Go downstairs to the lab,
tell them the joke's over...

05:52.645 --> 05:54.856
send up the real Agent Prince.

05:55.357 --> 05:56.526
You know something?

05:56.609 --> 05:59.112
I'd really like to find out
what you do for a living...

05:59.196 --> 06:00.906
but I don't have the time.

06:02.617 --> 06:04.035
Mr. Hawthorn.

06:04.118 --> 06:06.205
You must be the real Agent Prince?

06:06.288 --> 06:08.083
Mr. Hawthorn.

06:08.917 --> 06:13.757
My name is Diana Prince and I have been
transferred to your field office.

06:13.840 --> 06:15.842
This may come as a surprise to you...

06:15.926 --> 06:18.805
but not all government agents
wear polyester.

06:21.392 --> 06:22.435
Carol!

06:22.519 --> 06:24.270
My name is Dr. Akers...

06:24.354 --> 06:27.566
and I'm looking for someone
by the name of Prince.

06:27.650 --> 06:29.861
Prince! Right there with the monkey.

06:29.945 --> 06:32.198
- Chimpanzee.
- It's Diana Prince.

06:32.323 --> 06:36.161
Come in, Doctor.
I take it, this is your monkey?

06:36.245 --> 06:37.705
Well, chimpanzee.

06:39.374 --> 06:40.876
Tobias!

06:42.336 --> 06:43.713
Look at you!

06:45.257 --> 06:48.135
According to his tag,
he's registered to you for research.

06:48.219 --> 06:51.683
Yeah. I was involved in a joint project,
but my partner and I split up...

06:51.766 --> 06:53.559
and Tobias went with him.

06:53.643 --> 06:56.772
But, somebody must have forgot
to lock the door, eh, Toby?

06:57.399 --> 07:00.653
What kind of research
were you involved in, Doctor?

07:01.112 --> 07:02.530
Why do you ask that?

07:02.696 --> 07:05.534
Well, Tobias is a little peculiar.

07:05.952 --> 07:09.081
He doesn't seem to need food or water.
Never gets tired.

07:09.706 --> 07:12.043
And I want to show you something else.

07:19.886 --> 07:22.265
He's not only impervious to pain...

07:22.348 --> 07:26.229
but to any and all physical injury.
He's invulnerable, Doctor.

07:26.896 --> 07:29.942
And I think that we ought to hear
about your research.

07:31.110 --> 07:32.320
Yeah.

07:32.904 --> 07:34.239
This way.

07:35.241 --> 07:38.203
I worked for Joseph Reichman
on government-funded research...

07:38.286 --> 07:40.205
into the aging process.

07:40.873 --> 07:43.167
Now, they said that he was brilliant.

07:43.710 --> 07:46.213
Well, I soon found out that he was insane.

07:46.296 --> 07:50.761
He was obsessed
with control and domination.

07:51.136 --> 07:52.722
What he was really after...

07:52.806 --> 07:56.727
was to create this army
of invulnerable men...

07:57.353 --> 08:00.649
with which to take over this country,
and someday the world.

08:00.774 --> 08:02.568
- What?
- Yeah. For certain.

08:03.111 --> 08:07.033
You see, Reichman and I
are molecular biologists...

08:08.076 --> 08:09.536
but we have different approaches.

08:09.619 --> 08:13.708
Reichman's specialty is radiation,
of which I know very little.

08:14.376 --> 08:19.049
And mine has to do with the injections
of a chemical mixture known only to me.

08:19.258 --> 08:21.135
Now collectively...

08:21.218 --> 08:23.805
we were headed
for a fantastic breakthrough.

08:23.888 --> 08:26.433
Until a month ago,
when I saw the real Reichman...

08:26.517 --> 08:29.854
and what he was after.
And then I broke off with him. But...

08:32.357 --> 08:34.986
Stupid. I left behind...

08:35.570 --> 08:37.073
in the laboratory...

08:37.615 --> 08:40.119
three syringes. Three.

08:41.830 --> 08:45.876
Now, maybe he's tried
to make a chimpanzee invulnerable.

08:45.960 --> 08:48.839
- But do you think that he would really-
- Yeah.

08:49.005 --> 08:51.676
That would be his next step
with the syringes.

08:51.843 --> 08:54.847
Finding and using a human guinea pig.

09:10.994 --> 09:15.374
Come on, will you, Kandel? You make
the rest of the faculty look anemic.

09:16.876 --> 09:19.588
Look at this, you're not even sweating.

09:21.215 --> 09:23.051
And as for your pulse rate...

09:23.135 --> 09:24.678
It's just over 50.

09:25.680 --> 09:28.057
You've been exercising for half an hour.

09:28.392 --> 09:31.729
And that, even for an ex-football player,
is not normal.

09:32.272 --> 09:35.067
Come on, Kandel.
Tell me, what's your secret?

09:36.527 --> 09:39.907
I volunteered for some research
a couple of weeks ago.

09:39.991 --> 09:41.909
I can always use the extra money.

09:41.993 --> 09:44.788
The guy's into gerontology, study of aging.

09:44.871 --> 09:46.207
You're getting injections?

09:46.291 --> 09:48.251
Yeah. And radiation.

09:48.544 --> 09:51.296
You know, they're experimenting
with the oxidation process...

09:51.381 --> 09:53.425
- or something like that. I don't know.
- Who?

09:53.925 --> 09:55.386
Dr. Reichman.

09:55.803 --> 09:57.848
It's government-funded research...

09:57.931 --> 10:00.435
and the guy came out
of the Army Medical Corps.

10:00.518 --> 10:02.603
I want to be there
when you see him again.

10:02.687 --> 10:05.441
I'd like to know
exactly what he's doing to you.

10:06.860 --> 10:09.196
You want to know something else?

10:09.655 --> 10:12.284
I haven't eaten or drunk anything
for two days.

10:15.454 --> 10:16.872
Haven't slept, either.

10:16.956 --> 10:19.751
Now you call me before you go. You hear?

10:20.628 --> 10:23.006
- You're just jealous.
- It's not normal.

10:41.865 --> 10:43.491
Don't touch him.

10:43.575 --> 10:44.827
You call an ambulance!

10:44.910 --> 10:48.290
Prepare them for head injuries
and a possible broken neck!

10:51.043 --> 10:53.171
- I'm all right.
- Bryce, stay where you are.

10:53.255 --> 10:54.506
Don't move.

10:54.965 --> 10:57.010
All right. I'm fine.

10:59.179 --> 11:01.349
- Bryce!
- I said I'm okay.

11:26.966 --> 11:28.886
You're Agent Prince?

11:29.177 --> 11:32.807
Diana Prince. For about
the 15th time today and who are you?

11:32.890 --> 11:34.977
T. Burton Phipps lll.

11:35.602 --> 11:39.066
And if this is the way Feds
are looking in Washington, then...

11:39.150 --> 11:41.903
better call my travel agent, but quick.

11:41.987 --> 11:45.450
Is there something I can do for you,
T. Burton Phipps?

11:45.533 --> 11:47.870
The Third. T. for short.

11:48.954 --> 11:50.957
Going home for the evening?

11:51.040 --> 11:53.251
Well, no. I've got some work to do.

11:54.128 --> 11:57.632
- Had dinner yet?
- No, I actually haven't had time.

11:57.716 --> 12:01.012
Yes, the magic words. What'll it be?

12:08.439 --> 12:09.690
What'll it be?

12:10.024 --> 12:13.111
Well, how about an apple?

12:14.572 --> 12:16.490
Jonathan or Golden Delicious?

12:16.742 --> 12:18.535
Either one is fine.

12:19.077 --> 12:20.329
Okay.

12:22.958 --> 12:25.252
Golden Delicious. 50 cents.

12:25.879 --> 12:27.922
Fifty cents for an apple?

12:30.759 --> 12:34.348
- At the store it costs a third of that.
- If you had time.

12:35.016 --> 12:37.561
Me, I've got nothing but time.

12:38.604 --> 12:40.607
And a horrendous overhead cost...

12:40.690 --> 12:43.360
and it somehow comes out to 50 cents.

12:44.445 --> 12:45.529
Somehow.

12:45.780 --> 12:47.490
Fifty cents. There you go.

12:48.408 --> 12:49.952
Thank you.

12:59.548 --> 13:00.800
No.

13:01.468 --> 13:02.844
Mr. Phipps.

13:03.345 --> 13:06.808
Mr. Phipps, how many times
have I told you...

13:06.933 --> 13:11.439
to confine your capitalistic adventures
to the corridors and not in my office?

13:12.482 --> 13:14.861
Exactly 31.

13:17.990 --> 13:20.994
Then for the 32nd time, get out of here.

13:24.165 --> 13:27.711
- A pleasure transacting with you, D.P.
- Thank you, Mr. T.

13:27.794 --> 13:29.589
As for you...

13:33.719 --> 13:34.887
Wait.

13:35.096 --> 13:36.347
No rush, no rush.

13:37.098 --> 13:39.393
I'm gonna kill him.
Someday I'm gonna kill that kid.

13:39.477 --> 13:43.148
Well, if he's the third I'm glad
I'm spared the first and second.

13:43.231 --> 13:45.151
- We got problems.
- What's that?

13:45.234 --> 13:48.030
Reichman has disappeared.
I notified the police.

13:48.113 --> 13:51.951
That means national security is involved,
and that means we're involved.

13:52.035 --> 13:54.955
I'm supposed to meet Akers
at the lab where he and Reichman...

13:55.039 --> 13:59.629
conducted their research together.
In about 45 minutes.

15:20.945 --> 15:23.616
Excuse me. I'm looking for a Dr. Reichman.

15:23.699 --> 15:25.284
So am I, young man.

15:26.286 --> 15:27.829
We go together?

15:31.668 --> 15:34.547
- I've been trying to call him all day.
- Yeah?

15:35.173 --> 15:36.507
Well, he's gone.

15:37.509 --> 15:39.178
He'll be back, won't he?

15:42.682 --> 15:45.436
That all depends on what he's left behind.

15:58.454 --> 16:00.457
What is it you must...

16:01.208 --> 16:02.793
talk to him about?

16:40.969 --> 16:42.179
You're on fire!

16:42.262 --> 16:44.974
Don't worry about me,
just get him out of here.

17:21.189 --> 17:22.942
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

17:43.636 --> 17:45.597
I'm gonna put you under 24-hour guard.

17:45.680 --> 17:47.182
Reichman wants you out of the way.

17:47.265 --> 17:50.646
Maybe, but it is my guess
that he blew the lab apart...

17:50.729 --> 17:53.900
to destroy any record
of his contribution to the process.

17:53.983 --> 17:55.902
From what Wonder Woman told Diana...

17:55.985 --> 17:58.864
he's already created
his first invulnerable human.

17:58.948 --> 18:02.745
Yes. But he still needs Dr. Akers
to recreate his chemical mixture.

18:03.204 --> 18:06.917
Now, this was salvaged from that lab.
Looks to me like a list of names...

18:07.000 --> 18:09.671
maybe subjects
for Reichman's experiments?

18:09.754 --> 18:12.424
It's possible,
but I've never seen this before.

18:14.636 --> 18:17.848
One of these names could be
the man Wonder Woman saw.

18:18.182 --> 18:19.475
Could be.

18:19.601 --> 18:20.852
Let me ask you a question.

18:20.936 --> 18:24.190
If you were Reichman,
where would you solicit volunteers?

18:24.273 --> 18:25.776
The university.

18:26.318 --> 18:28.111
That's a good point.

18:29.239 --> 18:33.035
I'm going to call over to admissions
right now and tell them you're coming.

18:33.118 --> 18:34.788
- Thank you.
- Diana...

18:35.830 --> 18:39.460
do me a favor. I know
you don't like to be told what to do.

18:39.794 --> 18:43.049
But in this case I'd really like you
to be careful.

18:46.387 --> 18:49.224
Well, well. So, this is Agent Prince.

18:49.307 --> 18:51.184
Real cover girl, isn't she?

18:51.476 --> 18:54.856
Supposed to be
the cream of the IADC's crop.

18:55.148 --> 18:59.779
What a pity. Within 24 hours,
she will have died an untimely death.

19:00.071 --> 19:02.032
- Right, Mr. Dupris?
- Yes, sir.

19:05.036 --> 19:07.748
Better than any timepiece invented,
this one is.

19:07.832 --> 19:10.794
I'd feel better if he didn't look
for people when he's hungry.

19:10.877 --> 19:12.797
You're in no danger
as long as he knows you.

19:12.880 --> 19:15.968
It is strangers who could
and have become free meals.

19:16.051 --> 19:18.638
You are correct in maintaining
a healthy respect for him.

19:18.721 --> 19:20.975
Power must always be respected.

19:21.517 --> 19:25.522
You are as afraid of him as the world
will soon be of Joseph Reichman.

19:25.605 --> 19:28.484
Akers' notes. I must have Akers' notes.

19:28.567 --> 19:31.279
Without that formula for the substance
that he invented...

19:31.363 --> 19:35.452
it will take years to duplicate my success
with Kandel and the chimpanzee...

19:35.994 --> 19:39.457
and much longer
before I can achieve my goal.

19:39.582 --> 19:41.210
I have Akers' address right here.

19:41.293 --> 19:43.629
But word is
that there are two bodyguards on him.

19:45.006 --> 19:48.970
Are the people on this list freshmen,
or grad students or faculty members...

19:49.053 --> 19:51.139
- or what?
- I don't know.

19:51.223 --> 19:53.518
Frankly, I'm not even sure
if the people on that list...

19:53.601 --> 19:55.854
are even connected with the university.

19:56.355 --> 19:58.566
But you expect
to go through our admissions files...

19:58.650 --> 20:01.529
and match one of these names
with a face in your head?

20:01.612 --> 20:03.072
I expect to try.

20:03.155 --> 20:06.451
Wow, you've got the needle.
We've got the haystack.

20:06.994 --> 20:10.249
What's worse, not all of our applicants
submit photographs...

20:10.332 --> 20:12.292
so even if these people are students here...

20:12.376 --> 20:15.547
I can't guarantee
you'll be able to match a face.

20:17.716 --> 20:19.261
I don't believe it.

20:22.181 --> 20:24.141
The face is right there.

20:24.518 --> 20:25.769
Well, that's Bryce Kandel.

20:25.852 --> 20:29.524
Used to be the star of the football team.
Now he's a professor here.

20:30.609 --> 20:32.236
What does he teach?

20:32.319 --> 20:34.447
Computer science, of all things.

20:34.906 --> 20:38.911
Well, if you don't mind, I'd like
his home address and telephone number.

20:38.995 --> 20:41.206
So would every woman on this campus.

20:47.297 --> 20:48.758
Bryce. How are you?

20:49.092 --> 20:51.303
I've got a million questions
for you, Doctor...

20:51.387 --> 20:53.139
but I wanna know just one thing.

20:53.222 --> 20:54.850
When will it wear off?

20:54.933 --> 20:57.645
Why? Have my treatments
disagreed with you?

20:58.062 --> 21:00.566
I don't eat. I don't sleep.
I don't feel pain.

21:00.649 --> 21:03.528
I don't even get hurt
when a room blows up in my face.

21:03.611 --> 21:05.197
I don't like it!

21:06.073 --> 21:09.577
You want to suffer hunger?
You want to suffer pain?

21:10.203 --> 21:11.789
You want to die?

21:12.790 --> 21:15.961
Yeah. I do. That's part of being alive...

21:16.754 --> 21:18.631
part of being human.

21:19.173 --> 21:21.885
All I am now is some kind of freak.

21:22.804 --> 21:24.848
I didn't asked for this, Doctor.

21:25.140 --> 21:27.309
I want whatever you did to me to end.

21:27.393 --> 21:31.315
What I have done is rearranged
your molecular structure, halting those...

21:31.399 --> 21:35.571
biological processes which result
in the destruction of cells and tissues...

21:35.654 --> 21:37.323
in ordinary people.

21:38.241 --> 21:40.244
When will it wear off?

21:40.369 --> 21:44.624
It cannot wear off.
The treatment can only be reversed.

21:46.377 --> 21:49.631
And I'm afraid, Bryce, there are
certain things you must do for me...

21:49.715 --> 21:52.009
before I reverse the treatment.

21:54.011 --> 21:55.347
I'll go to the police.

21:55.431 --> 21:58.768
You will not do anything,
save exactly what I tell you.

21:59.352 --> 22:01.730
I won't be some kind of slave!

22:01.814 --> 22:03.650
Yes, indeed, you shall.

22:04.109 --> 22:06.279
Or the treatment will be permanent.

22:10.617 --> 22:12.620
What do you want me to do?

22:15.332 --> 22:17.376
Bryce, I have certain enemies.

22:17.711 --> 22:21.215
One is an ex-colleague, from whom
I am going to have you retrieve...

22:21.299 --> 22:23.175
extremely critical data.

22:23.300 --> 22:25.470
The others are with the IADC.

22:25.804 --> 22:28.683
If you ever make contact
with anyone there...

22:29.518 --> 22:31.603
you will never see me again.

23:32.351 --> 23:33.770
Hi.

23:34.938 --> 23:38.693
You leave your extra key
in exactly the same place as...

23:38.776 --> 23:41.196
one of my friends used to leave theirs.

23:41.613 --> 23:45.703
I apologize for using it to get in, but
it's really important that I talk to you.

23:45.786 --> 23:49.749
My name is Diana Prince
and I'm with the IADC.

23:53.045 --> 23:54.548
Hey, wait! Hold it.

24:35.311 --> 24:39.357
All right, Professor, how about
a little lesson on Dr. Joseph Reichman.

24:39.733 --> 24:42.028
Where is he and what is he up to?

24:44.156 --> 24:46.993
You have to answer me.
You have no choice.

24:48.286 --> 24:49.997
Afraid not, Wonder Woman.

24:51.791 --> 24:54.879
I guess there are advantages
to my condition after all.

25:00.970 --> 25:02.180
Seeing this is useless-

25:02.263 --> 25:04.308
I would rather you keep it on.

25:04.558 --> 25:08.771
You have this annoying tendency
to run off when people try to talk to you.

25:08.855 --> 25:11.692
I'm not gonna run away.
You have my word on that.

25:12.736 --> 25:14.654
The word of a fellow invincible.

25:14.738 --> 25:16.991
- Will you tell me the truth?
- Yes.

25:18.994 --> 25:21.289
Did you plant that bomb
in Reichman's lab?

25:21.372 --> 25:22.415
No.

25:22.498 --> 25:25.502
Do you know if he's created
any other people like you?

25:25.919 --> 25:27.505
No, I'm sure he hasn't.

25:27.589 --> 25:29.675
According to the man
who used to work with him...

25:29.759 --> 25:33.722
Dr. Reichman's ultimate goal is to
create an entire army of invincibles...

25:33.805 --> 25:35.015
just like you.

25:35.098 --> 25:38.562
Look, Wonder Woman, I don't care
what Reichman is going to do.

25:38.645 --> 25:40.731
All I care about is what he did. To me.

25:41.816 --> 25:45.613
As far as I'm concerned, I'm in this alone,
and that's the way I'm playing it.

25:45.696 --> 25:48.199
I'm sorry about that,
but if you change your mind...

25:48.283 --> 25:51.912
I believe Diana Prince left her address
up in your apartment.

25:53.415 --> 25:56.210
She really wants to help you, Bryce,
and so do I.

26:00.341 --> 26:02.594
I can handle the bodyguard, Reichman.

26:03.053 --> 26:04.430
I expect you to.

26:04.680 --> 26:06.807
Okay, what time should I be there?

26:07.267 --> 26:11.606
They plan to transfer Dr. Akers
to a safe house promptly at 10:00 a. m.

26:12.690 --> 26:14.443
And where do we meet afterwards?

26:14.526 --> 26:16.571
The hotel elevator will do.

26:16.654 --> 26:19.450
Just make sure you get everything, Bryce.

26:19.742 --> 26:22.203
No matter what it takes to do so.

26:22.287 --> 26:25.458
Look, just make sure you keep
your end of the deal, okay?

26:42.981 --> 26:44.608
Mr. Hawthorn's office.

26:44.691 --> 26:47.153
Is he there, please? This is Diana Prince.

26:47.236 --> 26:48.822
Hey, Di, what you say?

26:48.906 --> 26:49.948
Who is this?

26:50.032 --> 26:53.453
T. Burton Phipps lll.
Golden Delicious, remember?

26:54.121 --> 26:56.290
Yeah. Where's Carol?

26:56.373 --> 26:58.418
She stepped out to borrow some bread.

26:58.543 --> 27:00.922
I think she wants to score a Danish...

27:01.005 --> 27:03.258
but she doesn't quite have enough money.

27:04.134 --> 27:06.512
I'll bet. Is Dale there?

27:07.055 --> 27:09.808
Do you think I'd be here
if the Big D were here?

27:10.935 --> 27:13.981
If he knew I was here
talking on an IADC telephone...

27:15.900 --> 27:19.321
he'd probably kick my rear
clear into next Tuesday.

27:19.488 --> 27:21.908
Carol, any word
on that technician from D.C. yet?

27:22.074 --> 27:25.872
Unless I put you on hold this week's
gonna go by awful fast. Bye, Di.

27:27.081 --> 27:28.626
No, don't!

27:28.876 --> 27:30.085
I'm at a phone booth.

27:40.266 --> 27:43.354
Having to tell you something 33 times...

27:43.520 --> 27:46.858
does not make you a fast learner,
does it, Mr. Phipps.

27:47.192 --> 27:50.863
Look, my business consists of bringing
the supply to the demand.

27:51.656 --> 27:52.866
Out.

27:52.949 --> 27:54.827
You're hampering the growth
of free enterprise...

27:54.911 --> 27:57.498
without which
you would not even be here.

27:57.748 --> 27:58.916
Out.

27:58.999 --> 28:03.171
I'm seriously thinking of filing
a restraint of trade complaint against you.

28:03.255 --> 28:04.632
You do that.

28:07.719 --> 28:09.847
You have a call on line three.

28:15.939 --> 28:18.400
- Hello?
- Mr. Hawthorn? This is Diana.

28:18.525 --> 28:20.695
Listen, I'm gonna be a little late
this morning.

28:20.779 --> 28:23.031
The people putting my phone in
are coming any minute.

28:23.114 --> 28:24.658
Yeah, listen to this...

28:24.742 --> 28:27.662
the lab boys just finished
analyzing some of those particles...

28:27.746 --> 28:29.081
found in that chimp's fur.

28:29.164 --> 28:31.167
They think it was being held
in a wooded area...

28:31.250 --> 28:33.545
before it escaped
and made its way into the city.

28:33.712 --> 28:37.133
Possibly, Malibu or Topanga Canyon.

28:37.467 --> 28:39.720
So you think that's where Reichman is?

28:40.095 --> 28:41.223
It's a good possibility.

28:41.306 --> 28:42.641
Please signal when through.

28:42.724 --> 28:45.394
Thank you, operator.
Thank you, Mr. Hawthorn.

28:46.229 --> 28:48.857
Thank you, T. Burton Phipps,
wherever you are.

29:00.164 --> 29:02.376
I have to relieve you
of that briefcase, Dr. Akers.

29:02.459 --> 29:03.752
Just hold it right there.

29:33.751 --> 29:35.252
Give me the briefcase, Doctor.

29:35.336 --> 29:36.630
You fool.

29:40.885 --> 29:43.597
Don't you know
that that madman has damned you?

29:56.865 --> 29:59.994
You scared me to death.
I didn't see any truck outside. Listen...

30:00.078 --> 30:02.205
I want one phone in here
then one in the bedroom.

30:02.289 --> 30:06.002
- I'm really in a hurry-
- I'm not here to put in a phone, Diana.

30:07.295 --> 30:10.675
But if you're expecting company
that does change my plans.

30:11.134 --> 30:12.302
Who are you?

30:12.677 --> 30:15.306
Friend of an enemy. Let's go outside.

30:22.273 --> 30:24.735
Well, Bryce, you obviously
had no problems.

30:24.819 --> 30:25.946
When?

30:26.279 --> 30:30.576
I have a certain amount of research to do
before I can effect a reversal treatment.

30:30.660 --> 30:32.120
When, Reichman?

30:32.454 --> 30:35.083
I have to review these notes,
set up a new lab...

30:35.166 --> 30:38.212
and do preliminary tests
on lower life forms.

30:39.296 --> 30:43.511
- In other words, you'll be in touch?
- Yes. I would say that about sums it up.

30:43.678 --> 30:46.890
Listen, Reichman, I'm going to be
just two steps behind you...

30:46.973 --> 30:48.683
until you reverse what you did to me.

30:48.768 --> 30:50.895
Well, I should certainly hope so.

30:50.978 --> 30:53.982
I expect you to be right there
seeing that nothing happens to me.

30:54.066 --> 30:55.819
Because if it does...

30:58.781 --> 31:02.410
I guess this means Reichman knows
we've got a fix on where he is.

31:02.494 --> 31:04.080
My sources say differently.

31:04.163 --> 31:07.000
Your sources must've gotten up
pretty late this morning.

31:07.084 --> 31:08.502
I just found out myself...

31:08.585 --> 31:12.383
your boss, Mr. Reichman,
is holed up at a place in Malibu Canyon.

31:12.466 --> 31:14.051
Close, but no cigar.

31:14.134 --> 31:17.138
The Ringe House on Harvard
in Topanga Canyon.

31:18.099 --> 31:20.643
You see how cleverly I got you
to tell me that?

31:21.019 --> 31:24.357
The only person you'll be
repeating it to is St. Peter.

31:24.440 --> 31:29.196
Should've stayed in Washington, Diana.
Life out here's just one gigantic fast lane.

31:29.948 --> 31:33.619
But then, some of the most important
lessons we learn are the last.

32:57.565 --> 32:58.732
Diana?

33:12.334 --> 33:14.170
Turnabout is fair play.

33:53.389 --> 33:55.308
Diana, are you here?

34:23.262 --> 34:25.556
Come on, wake up, Diana.

34:35.529 --> 34:39.074
Remind me to get the name
of your interior decorator before I leave.

34:39.158 --> 34:43.664
You try having just three days to move
from Washington, D.C. to Los Angeles.

34:44.081 --> 34:46.918
Besides, I'm kind of getting
to like it this way.

34:47.295 --> 34:49.255
You must've loved
the Alaskan earthquake.

34:49.338 --> 34:51.717
I feel like the Alaskan earthquake.

34:52.009 --> 34:53.303
Who did this to you?

34:53.386 --> 34:55.179
Reichman. One of his goons.

34:55.471 --> 34:56.931
- Oh, no.
- What?

34:57.099 --> 34:59.936
- I think I've done something really stupid.
- What?

35:00.019 --> 35:02.898
I stole Akers notes
and delivered them to Reichman.

35:03.274 --> 35:05.318
I didn't want to believe
he was the maniac...

35:05.402 --> 35:07.238
Wonder Woman's trying to tell me he was.

35:07.321 --> 35:09.782
Well, now he has the notes
to your chemical process...

35:09.866 --> 35:12.786
it's only a matter of time
before he creates hundreds like you.

35:12.870 --> 35:14.497
He's probably long gone, too.

35:14.581 --> 35:17.960
Maybe not. He would at least
wait around until...

35:18.210 --> 35:20.922
he got a report from the man
who was supposed to kill me.

35:21.006 --> 35:23.175
So he might have a head start
but not much of one.

35:23.259 --> 35:24.427
You know where Reichman is?

35:24.510 --> 35:26.888
Yes, Topanga Canyon.
You know where that is?

35:26.972 --> 35:28.725
- Yes.
- Let's go.

35:39.531 --> 35:42.785
You don't have Diana Prince
to kick around anymore.

35:43.244 --> 35:45.998
What method did you use to take her out?

35:46.331 --> 35:50.003
Southern California style:
a victim of air pollution.

35:51.589 --> 35:55.176
Well, Mr. Dupris, it will not be long now
before the whole world learns...

35:55.260 --> 35:57.888
what became perfectly clear to me
in the Medical Corps:

35:57.972 --> 36:00.017
that man is the ultimate weapon.

36:00.392 --> 36:01.810
My superiors were too busy...

36:01.893 --> 36:06.400
perfecting ways to destroy mankind
to listen to me, but now they'll listen...

36:06.734 --> 36:10.739
because what good will guns
and missiles and warheads do...

36:10.822 --> 36:13.576
against an army of men who cannot die.

36:29.514 --> 36:31.266
This has got to be it.

36:34.271 --> 36:37.358
- What're you doing?
- Looking for the wings.

36:37.775 --> 36:40.529
- I wasn't driving that fast.
- Oh, yes, you were.

36:43.533 --> 36:45.618
This place looks like a fortress.

36:45.995 --> 36:49.958
Listen, you start toward the house.
I'm gonna see if I can round up some help.

36:50.625 --> 36:51.878
Out here?

37:46.658 --> 37:47.827
Quick.

37:50.289 --> 37:52.082
- There's someone on the grounds.
- Alert the guards.

37:52.166 --> 37:55.295
Bring the car around.
Keep the engine running.

38:41.940 --> 38:45.362
Wonder Woman! Diana really did get help.

38:45.905 --> 38:48.450
Reichman's gotta be somewhere inside.

38:48.533 --> 38:51.162
And I'll just bet you that he can help.

38:52.580 --> 38:53.874
Cover me.

39:02.051 --> 39:04.095
All right. Where's Reichman?

39:08.602 --> 39:11.606
I want you to stay exactly where you are.

39:16.153 --> 39:17.405
No!

39:18.198 --> 39:20.367
Listen, I think we better split up.

39:20.951 --> 39:25.582
I'm gonna go around back
and you take the high road. Leg up?

39:35.220 --> 39:37.097
Two steps behind, Reichman.
I warned you-

39:37.181 --> 39:38.892
Attack. Get him.

39:53.953 --> 39:56.457
Something's wrong.
He's not even scratched.

40:00.128 --> 40:02.632
It's the formula. He is invulnerable.

40:14.898 --> 40:16.233
Stay.

40:19.446 --> 40:22.992
Now, I want you to wait down there
and we'll talk about it later.

40:33.423 --> 40:37.094
People will die all around you:
friends, lovers, children.

40:37.178 --> 40:42.143
And when this world ends,
you'll go on, and on. Alone.

40:44.104 --> 40:47.651
With that data in the suitcase,
I'm sure someone can figure out a cure.

40:47.734 --> 40:49.486
Sounds about right to me.

40:52.156 --> 40:55.118
It shall be my secret.
And someday I will return...

40:55.202 --> 40:58.039
with hundreds of men like you,
with or without this!

41:09.262 --> 41:10.515
Bryce!

41:10.848 --> 41:14.102
That smoke is poison!
We gotta get out of here! Come on!

41:50.818 --> 41:52.654
Bryce! You all right?

41:54.240 --> 41:56.242
All of his notes were destroyed.

42:08.801 --> 42:11.346
- I went to the track yesterday to run.
- Yes?

42:12.555 --> 42:14.892
I ran six four-minute miles.

42:16.435 --> 42:18.730
The only reason I stopped
was people were staring.

42:18.814 --> 42:21.651
Well, I hope no one was there
from the Olympic Committee.

42:21.776 --> 42:25.614
I can run forever, swim forever,
stay awake forever...

42:26.407 --> 42:28.994
everything there is to do, I can do forever.

42:29.411 --> 42:31.748
You know what the worst time of all is?

42:31.873 --> 42:33.124
It's the night.

42:34.084 --> 42:36.212
Late, like 3:00 in the morning...

42:37.839 --> 42:39.716
looking out over the city with...

42:39.800 --> 42:43.514
all the lights out, the freeways empty...

42:45.140 --> 42:48.436
nobody around, just me, alone...

42:50.106 --> 42:53.568
and knowing it's going to be like that
for a long, long time.

42:54.486 --> 42:58.200
No, Bryce. It is not going to be like that
for a long, long time...

42:58.283 --> 43:00.410
because there're two things
that you're gonna do.

43:00.495 --> 43:04.250
First of all, you're gonna stop
feeling sorry for yourself...

43:06.043 --> 43:10.633
and then, you're going to find Reichman
and make him reverse what he did to you!

43:10.800 --> 43:12.719
I'm gonna find Reichman?

43:13.136 --> 43:16.766
He could be anywhere in the world.
And I'm gonna find Reichman by myself?

43:16.849 --> 43:20.396
You're not exactly all by yourself, are you?
Hadn't you noticed?

43:20.729 --> 43:22.399
Yeah, I've noticed.

43:23.650 --> 43:26.153
You're not exactly chopped liver, are you?

43:27.572 --> 43:29.491
And neither is Wonder Woman.

43:30.326 --> 43:31.869
You know, Bryce...

43:31.953 --> 43:35.123
in a lot of ways Wonder Woman
is more alone than you are.

43:38.169 --> 43:41.258
Between us, we'll be able to track down
Reichman sooner or later.

43:41.341 --> 43:44.470
Meanwhile, you can't exactly go back
to teaching college, can you?

43:44.553 --> 43:46.347
Do you have any plans?

43:47.391 --> 43:49.518
I don't know what I'm going to do.

43:50.770 --> 43:55.652
You can always join the circus
and bill yourself as the Man of Steel.

43:56.945 --> 43:59.824
Great. I'd look great
in tights and a cape, huh?

44:01.493 --> 44:03.495
You wouldn't look so bad.

44:05.248 --> 44:09.419
Listen, I have an idea.
How would you like to work at the IADC?

44:10.087 --> 44:12.173
Would that mean working with you?

44:12.257 --> 44:13.342
Yes.

44:13.676 --> 44:14.969
I'd hate it.

44:39.627 --> 44:42.881
I just talked to the police.
They're writing off Reichman.

44:42.965 --> 44:44.508
He vanished without a trace.

44:44.591 --> 44:47.345
Great! And without his notes.

44:48.222 --> 44:51.268
If he's still determined to create
an army of invulnerable men...

44:51.351 --> 44:53.228
at least he'll have to start from scratch.

44:53.311 --> 44:55.231
Yup! And Kandel vanished also.

44:55.731 --> 44:58.735
Maybe he's just keeping
a low profile someplace, you know...

44:58.819 --> 45:02.073
if you were invulnerable,
would you want the world to know?

45:03.409 --> 45:06.746
Look, I know Wonder Woman
had a lot to do with this case...

45:08.164 --> 45:11.294
I'm not one who likes to say
thank you very much, but...

45:13.338 --> 45:15.299
thank you. And welcome aboard.

45:16.717 --> 45:18.428
Thank you, Mr. Hawthorn.

45:26.147 --> 45:28.483
What is this monkey doing here?

45:30.611 --> 45:34.575
With Reichman still on the loose,
Dr. Akers didn't really feel comfortable...

45:34.659 --> 45:37.496
with keeping Tobias around himself, so...

45:40.417 --> 45:42.419
- You're his new mommy?
- No.

45:42.961 --> 45:44.588
I found him a new papa.

45:44.755 --> 45:47.676
No, not me.

45:47.759 --> 45:50.179
I wouldn't do it to you, Mr. Hawthorn.

46:02.529 --> 46:03.614
Diana?

46:03.864 --> 46:05.074
Come in.

46:09.455 --> 46:13.043
This is the new computer technician
that you had requested from Washington.

46:13.127 --> 46:15.338
Also, Toby's new father.

46:15.463 --> 46:18.676
As it turns out, he and I
have worked together before. Right?

46:20.929 --> 46:22.597
Dale Hawthorn. Bret Cassiday.

46:22.681 --> 46:24.142
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you.

46:24.225 --> 46:27.229
Diana showed me your credentials
yesterday. They're quite impressive.

46:27.312 --> 46:28.397
Thank you, sir.

46:28.480 --> 46:30.775
I'll tell you what.
For your first assignment...

46:31.067 --> 46:33.320
get this monkey out of here.

46:34.154 --> 46:35.490
Go to your papa.

46:38.869 --> 46:40.997
Diana, can I borrow 75 cents?

46:41.080 --> 46:42.708
Sure. What for?

46:43.333 --> 46:44.627
I need to buy a paper.

46:44.711 --> 46:46.838
Seventy-five cents for a newspaper?

46:54.223 --> 46:56.143
Doesn't he ever go to school?

47:38.115 --> 47:39.409
English
