35:02.918 --> 35:05.151
the<i> New York World.</i>

35:05.153 --> 35:07.220
KLEINBERG: Pulitzer bought
the paper at a time

35:07.222 --> 35:09.222
when it was not doing so well,

35:09.224 --> 35:11.958
at a time when it was
struggling a bit to survive,

35:11.960 --> 35:14.561
and he had a big dream
to make it something different,

35:14.563 --> 35:16.763
something better.

35:16.765 --> 35:19.299
WILDMAN: Pulitzer has just
turned the failing publication

35:19.301 --> 35:20.767
into a success

35:20.769 --> 35:24.237
by using it as an outlet
to crusade for social justice

35:24.239 --> 35:27.574
during one of the worst
economic depressions in history.

35:27.576 --> 35:30.243
KLEINBERG:
America was in the midst
of a deep recession.

35:30.245 --> 35:32.979
About 4% of factories
had shut down,

35:32.981 --> 35:36.449
so the plight of the poor was
a real issue in the country.

35:36.451 --> 35:38.718
WILDMAN:
He instructs his writers
to use their columns

35:38.720 --> 35:41.120
to take up the cause
of the common man

35:41.122 --> 35:43.256
and take on the city's elite.

35:43.258 --> 35:46.392
Politics in New York City
at this time was deeply corrupt.

35:46.394 --> 35:50.330
Pulitzer was a social crusader,
and he wanted to rid the city

35:50.332 --> 35:53.800
and the country
of corrupt politicians.

35:53.802 --> 35:57.170
WILDMAN: And Pulitzer doesn't
just focus on local issues.

35:57.172 --> 35:59.072
When the presidential election
heats up,

35:59.074 --> 36:01.474
Pulitzer pays close attention.

36:01.476 --> 36:03.476
On one side of the race
for the White House

36:03.478 --> 36:04.744
is Republican candidate

36:04.746 --> 36:07.747
and former Speaker of the House
James Blaine.

36:07.749 --> 36:09.882
KLEINBERG: James Blaine was
a long-time politician

36:09.884 --> 36:10.950
for the Republican Party.

36:10.952 --> 36:13.086
He had held numerous positions.

36:13.088 --> 36:16.957
He was politically connected,
extremely savvy,

36:16.959 --> 36:20.226
and determined to win.

36:20.228 --> 36:22.028
WILDMAN:
On the Democratic side

36:22.030 --> 36:24.564
is the 47-year-old
governor of New York,

36:24.566 --> 36:26.199
Grover Cleveland.

36:26.201 --> 36:28.702
Cleveland has earned
a sterling reputation

36:28.704 --> 36:31.504
as a staunch advocate
for government reform.

36:31.506 --> 36:34.240
KLEINBERG: Grover Cleveland was
an anti-corruption candidate.

36:34.242 --> 36:36.175
His nickname was Grover the Good

36:36.177 --> 36:38.678
because of his
anti-corruption stance.

36:40.716 --> 36:42.916
WILDMAN: Pulitzer believes
that Cleveland will do more

36:42.918 --> 36:45.918
to help working Americans
than James Blaine,

36:45.920 --> 36:48.655
and therefore, he wants to
put the power of his paper

36:48.657 --> 36:50.390
behind Cleveland.

36:50.392 --> 36:52.892
Pulitzer worried that having
James Blaine as president

36:52.894 --> 36:54.394
would make the situation worse,

36:54.396 --> 36:56.763
that the discrepancy
between rich and poor

36:56.765 --> 36:58.464
would grow even larger.

37:01.470 --> 37:03.202
WILDMAN: The polls show
the two candidates

37:03.204 --> 37:05.471
locked in a tight race,

37:05.473 --> 37:07.006
but then a story breaks

37:07.008 --> 37:10.209
that threatens to eviscerate
Cleveland's chances.

37:10.211 --> 37:12.679
In July,
the<i> Buffalo Evening Telegraph,</i>

37:12.681 --> 37:15.047
a competitor to Pulitzer's
<i>New York World,</i>

37:15.049 --> 37:19.151
publishes a scandalous exposé
about the Democratic candidate.

37:19.153 --> 37:21.620
According to the report,
Cleveland has secretly

37:21.622 --> 37:24.957
supported an illegitimate child
for years.

37:24.959 --> 37:27.627
And while he's financially
aided the boy and his mother,

37:27.629 --> 37:30.296
the news rattles
a sensitive electorate.

37:30.298 --> 37:32.665

37:32.667 --> 37:35.168
KLEINBERG: This was a shocking
story at the time.

37:35.170 --> 37:38.305
He was an upstanding
crusading candidate

37:38.307 --> 37:41.908
who had done something
considered very salacious.

37:41.910 --> 37:44.176
WILDMAN:
All along the campaign trail,

37:44.178 --> 37:47.580
the Democratic nominee
is ruthlessly mocked.

37:47.582 --> 37:49.582
KLEINBERG:
A jingle became very popular

37:49.584 --> 37:52.385
which would say,
"Mama, where's my pa?"

37:52.387 --> 37:55.889
So Cleveland became something
of a laughingstock

37:55.891 --> 37:57.924
who was terribly flawed.

37:57.926 --> 38:01.994
Suddenly, Cleveland's standing
in the race is in question.

38:01.996 --> 38:03.930
WILDMAN: In late October,

38:03.932 --> 38:05.932
with election day
fast approaching,

38:05.934 --> 38:09.002
Pulitzer needs to turn the tide
in Cleveland's favor,

38:09.004 --> 38:12.005
and he's about to uncover
the scoop of a lifetime.

38:12.007 --> 38:14.774
A week before the election,
a bombshell hit.

38:20.348 --> 38:22.615
1884 -- it's an election year,

38:22.617 --> 38:25.085
and the race for the White House
is heating up.

38:25.087 --> 38:27.687
In New York City,
publisher Joseph Pulitzer

38:27.689 --> 38:29.622
has thrown the full weight
of his newspaper

38:29.624 --> 38:32.892
behind the Democratic
nominee, Grover Cleveland.

38:32.894 --> 38:36.529
But when Cleveland becomes
embroiled in a huge scandal,

38:36.531 --> 38:39.999
it seems the publishing magnate
may have backed the wrong guy.

38:40.001 --> 38:44.270
But Pulitzer has one more card
up his sleeve.

38:44.272 --> 38:46.939
Just days before
the presidential election,

38:46.941 --> 38:49.475
Joseph Pulitzer's hopes
for a victory by Cleveland

38:49.477 --> 38:51.144
appear to be dashed.

38:51.146 --> 38:55.214
But then, Pulitzer spies
an opportunity.

38:55.216 --> 38:58.751
He heard that Blaine is going to
be the guest of honor

38:58.753 --> 39:01.220
at a Republican dinner.

39:01.222 --> 39:06.459
It's expensive and posh
and only for the city's elite.

39:06.461 --> 39:08.628
WILDMAN: At a time
when millions of Americans

39:08.630 --> 39:11.197
are struggling to
put food on the table,

39:11.199 --> 39:14.200
Pulitzer believes that Blaine's
participation in the dinner

39:14.202 --> 39:15.901
could be used against him.

39:15.903 --> 39:18.604
KLEINBERG: Pulitzer saw this
as an opportunity.

39:18.606 --> 39:20.874
He saw it as a chance
to show the public

39:20.876 --> 39:22.608
what kind of person
Blaine was,

39:22.610 --> 39:25.145
that he was always socializing
with the rich

39:25.147 --> 39:28.347
and that the wealthy were the
people that he cared about most.

39:28.349 --> 39:30.683
WILDMAN:
On the day of the soiree,

39:30.685 --> 39:34.087
Pulitzer sends a reporter
to scope out the scene.

39:34.089 --> 39:36.189
At the lavish affair,
the correspondent

39:36.191 --> 39:39.692
witnesses Blaine hobnobbing
with a veritable who's who

39:39.694 --> 39:41.561

39:41.563 --> 39:46.032
KLEINBERG: John Jacob Astor,
Andrew Carnegie, Jay Gould,

It included foie gras

39:59.781 --> 40:01.548
There was even turtle soup.

Pulitzer publishes an account

Pulitzer includes
an illustration

40:25.807 --> 40:28.875

sent by Blaine's attendants

40:28.877 --> 40:30.777
