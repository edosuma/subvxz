00:28.194 --> 00:29.404
I need your help!

00:29.487 --> 00:32.532
I might've gotten into a teeny tiny
bit of trouble at school.

00:32.615 --> 00:35.035
What sort of teeny tiny trouble?

00:35.118 --> 00:38.371
You know that expression,
"If you love something, set it free"?

00:38.455 --> 00:40.123


00:40.206 --> 00:42.709
Be free, science lab frogs!

00:43.585 --> 00:45.045


00:46.629 --> 00:48.840
Be free, mashed potatoes!

00:48.923 --> 00:51.217
-

00:54.804 --> 00:57.056
Be free, pants!

01:00.226 --> 01:02.437
You set your pants free?

01:02.520 --> 01:03.605
And my legs.

01:03.688 --> 01:06.483
And now Teacherman wants
Mom or Dad to come to school

01:06.566 --> 01:08.068
and sign a behavioral report,

01:08.151 --> 01:11.362
but we're gonna send
a Mom or Dad robot instead…

01:11.446 --> 01:14.240
-…cos you love me.

01:14.324 --> 01:18.661
Huh! This isn't like his other hugs
when he wants something.

01:18.745 --> 01:21.706
I'm actually sensing… affection.

01:21.790 --> 01:25.043
But we don't have
Mom and Dad-bots, Johnny.

01:25.126 --> 01:29.756
-We have Mom and Dad automatons!

01:32.675 --> 01:33.593
Yes!

01:35.470 --> 01:39.682
We're also working on
an elephant-amaton for zoos.

01:39.766 --> 01:42.018
So real elephants
can go back to the wild.

01:42.101 --> 01:45.104
Oh, that's nice,
and Johnny want Mommy-thing!

01:45.188 --> 01:48.817
Fine. But first,
we need to load the personality traits

01:48.900 --> 01:51.611
Mom-amaton will need
for a parent-teacher meeting.

01:52.362 --> 01:54.864
Friendliness, fierceness,

01:54.948 --> 01:58.743
and to always want to be with family.

01:58.827 --> 02:03.498
Wait. Mr. Teacherman can be harsh,
so let's double up on the fierceness.

02:10.296 --> 02:11.923
I am programmed to help.

02:12.006 --> 02:13.508
Awesome!

02:13.591 --> 02:18.513
Now, she signs your bad report,
then you come right back here.

02:18.596 --> 02:21.724
And real Mom or Dad
cannot see fake Mom

02:21.808 --> 02:23.560
under any circumstances.

02:23.643 --> 02:26.771
Then how do we get her
out of the house with Dad downstairs?

02:26.855 --> 02:28.398
With the Dad-distraction button.

02:29.357 --> 02:32.735
-Oven fire!

02:32.819 --> 02:34.571
Get the extinguisher!
Get it!

02:34.654 --> 02:35.613
Go!

02:37.615 --> 02:42.245
Thanks for coming in to discuss
Johnny's behavior report, Mrs. Test.

02:44.205 --> 02:46.207
Uh-huh. Great. I'll sign it.

02:46.291 --> 02:49.169
Wait, you're gonna sign it
without seeing how bad it is?

02:49.752 --> 02:53.381
Johnny has a strong,
independent spirit, loves frogs,

02:53.464 --> 02:56.301
and let's face it,
pants can be uncomfortable.

02:56.759 --> 03:00.388
Well, what about the mashed potatoes
he "freed" on my face?!

03:00.471 --> 03:03.349
He has a strong, independent spirit!

03:04.475 --> 03:06.936
And… I couldn't agree more.

03:07.020 --> 03:09.647
H-Have a great day.

03:10.315 --> 03:13.818
Oh, man, this<i> is</i> a great day,
and you were great!

03:13.902 --> 03:17.113
But I guess it's time
to take you back now.

03:17.196 --> 03:18.865
I am programmed to help.

03:18.948 --> 03:22.493
Like… you could help me get Dukey,

03:22.577 --> 03:25.705
and see what other helpful things
you can help me with?

03:25.788 --> 03:27.123
-Of course.

03:35.089 --> 03:35.965
Yes!

03:51.022 --> 03:52.357
Yes!

04:00.657 --> 04:01.824
Yes!

04:01.908 --> 04:02.867
Ow.

04:02.951 --> 04:05.578
Oh. Do you need to go to the dentist?

04:05.662 --> 04:08.164
What? Why would you say that?

04:08.248 --> 04:09.123
Ow.

04:09.207 --> 04:12.001
You're in pain, and I am here to help.

04:12.085 --> 04:15.922
And it would help
if I don't go to the dentist, ever.

04:16.631 --> 04:18.967
Then how about… more ice cream?

04:19.050 --> 04:21.094
She's amazing!

04:22.762 --> 04:25.473
Man, I wish my real mom
was more like you.

04:25.556 --> 04:26.808
Ow.

04:26.891 --> 04:30.853
And I wish I could be
wherever that is, with family.

04:30.937 --> 04:34.524
Yeah, but that's a billboard,
and we have to be going cos…

04:35.358 --> 04:36.567
I gotta get you back to the--

04:36.651 --> 04:39.362
-Hi, gang!
-Oh!

04:39.445 --> 04:41.239
I forgot to call Susan and Mary.

04:41.322 --> 04:42.865
You're home early.

04:42.949 --> 04:44.659
Because she has a sore throat,

04:44.742 --> 04:48.371
and it's helpful
for her to nod and not to talk.

04:49.956 --> 04:54.043
Well, then let me get my sweetheart
something soothing for that sore throat.

04:54.127 --> 04:56.838
-Phew! OK, that was close.

04:56.921 --> 04:59.465
Now get Mom-amaton up to the lab before…

04:59.549 --> 05:01.509
Hey, everyone, I'm home early!

05:01.592 --> 05:03.928
Quick, hide fake Mom!

05:06.264 --> 05:08.182
It's helpful to hide.

05:12.562 --> 05:15.898
Hi, Mom! I'll take your scarf
and put it in the closet later.

05:15.982 --> 05:17.233
OK…

05:17.317 --> 05:21.529
Nothing like an ice-pop
to cool down that burning throat.

05:23.698 --> 05:25.533
-Boop!
-Why are you doing that?

05:26.159 --> 05:27.869
Johnny said you had a sore throat.

05:27.952 --> 05:30.079
I meant<i> I</i> have a sore throat.

05:30.163 --> 05:32.373
So… Mm… Ow.

05:32.999 --> 05:34.876
Johnny, do you have a cavity?

05:34.959 --> 05:38.713
No, and I don't need to go
to the dentist ever. Ow.

05:39.339 --> 05:41.090
Yeah, I'm making an appointment.

05:42.592 --> 05:45.803
But you should do that in the office
where it's quieter,

05:45.887 --> 05:48.806
and you should go upstairs
and clean my room.

05:48.890 --> 05:51.517
Oh, um, OK…

05:55.021 --> 05:57.565
He said it would be helpful
if we stayed quiet,

05:57.648 --> 06:00.526
so I helped him be very quiet.

06:01.694 --> 06:04.530
Now, I want to be with family.

06:04.614 --> 06:07.784
Wait a minute!
I don't clean your room, you do!

06:07.867 --> 06:12.371
Uh, cool, but now it would help
if you go get me more ice cream.

06:12.455 --> 06:13.748
So… go!

06:13.831 --> 06:16.084
Now where's your mom going?

06:16.167 --> 06:18.628
-I'm right here.
-OK…

06:18.711 --> 06:20.630
I'm gonna go lay down now.

06:20.713 --> 06:23.508
Dad's funny,
and Dukey's tired, not dead.

06:23.591 --> 06:24.509
Homework time!

06:28.012 --> 06:30.306
-Don't worry, Dukey's not dead,

06:30.389 --> 06:33.351
but real Dad might've seen fake Mom.

06:33.434 --> 06:34.894
Johnny! We told you--

06:34.977 --> 06:38.397
But he's lying down confused,
and I sent her out for ice cream.

06:38.481 --> 06:42.276
You sent the Mom-amaton
into town by herself?

06:42.360 --> 06:43.653
Was that bad?

06:44.237 --> 06:47.698
<i>Hank Anchorman here</i>
<i>reporting that the Porkbelly police</i>

06:47.782 --> 06:51.661
<i>are on a manhunt,</i>
<i>or should I say momhunt?</i>

06:51.744 --> 06:54.163
It<i> was</i> bad.

06:54.247 --> 06:56.541
<i>So she said she left her purse</i>
<i>in a closet,</i>

06:56.624 --> 06:58.543
<i>so then I said</i>
<i>she doesn't get ice cream,</i>

06:58.626 --> 07:01.587
<i>and then she said, "It's for my family,"</i>
<i>and then bashed my cart.</i>

07:01.671 --> 07:04.924
Maybe we didn't need
to double up on the fierceness.

07:05.007 --> 07:06.551
Ya think?

07:06.634 --> 07:09.428
<i>If anyone has seen</i>
<i>this extremely dangerous mom,</i>

07:09.512 --> 07:11.055
<i>contact the police immediately!</i>

07:11.139 --> 07:13.683
Now people will think
our real mom

07:13.766 --> 07:16.227
robbed and assaulted
an ice-cream stand!

07:16.310 --> 07:17.603
We can fix this.

07:17.687 --> 07:21.774
I have a strong, independent spirit,
and you guys are geniuses.

07:21.858 --> 07:22.817
Right. OK.

07:22.900 --> 07:25.528
We'll distract Mom
so she doesn't watch the news…

07:26.404 --> 07:29.407
And Dad-amaton's
internal family tracking software

07:29.490 --> 07:32.660
will help you and Dukey
find Mom-amaton.

07:35.329 --> 07:36.831
I'm here to help!

07:36.914 --> 07:38.166
Yes!

07:38.249 --> 07:41.502
Help me and my dog find Mom-amaton
and power her down.

07:41.586 --> 07:43.379
OK.

07:43.463 --> 07:45.923
-And one last thing.

07:46.007 --> 07:49.177
The oven's on fire again!

07:49.260 --> 07:51.846
Let's see what's on the news.

07:52.388 --> 07:53.973
No!

07:54.056 --> 07:56.142
OK… Why?

07:56.225 --> 07:58.561
We should have
mother-daughter playtime?

07:58.644 --> 08:01.564
Because we grow up so fast.

08:01.647 --> 08:04.734
Oh, sweet. What should we play?

08:05.276 --> 08:06.819
Total Mom Makeover!

08:07.487 --> 08:09.447
I have located Mom-amaton.

08:09.530 --> 08:11.073
She is downtown.

08:12.742 --> 08:15.495
-We might be too late.
-Can you go any faster?

08:15.578 --> 08:17.246
I'm here to help!

08:19.874 --> 08:23.377
Wow! I'm gonna look like
a totally different person.

08:23.461 --> 08:25.922
-That's the idea!

08:26.005 --> 08:27.089
We'll get it!

08:28.341 --> 08:32.887
Sorry to bother you,
but we're looking for this woman.

08:32.970 --> 08:36.349
That's a scary-looking stranger,

08:36.432 --> 08:37.934
and no one here except--

08:38.017 --> 08:40.645
Hi, officers! Can we help you?

08:41.604 --> 08:43.189
Nope.

08:48.945 --> 08:51.072
Great! There she is.

08:52.448 --> 08:54.158
Not great. There<i> that</i> is!

08:54.242 --> 08:57.453
Stop him and power her down now.

08:58.996 --> 09:02.208
-Gotcha!

09:02.291 --> 09:05.503
-Let her go, Officer-Man.
-Sir, stay back!

09:11.217 --> 09:12.510
I should be mad, but…

09:12.593 --> 09:14.637
wheeee!

09:16.013 --> 09:18.724
You came to save me. Thank you.

09:18.808 --> 09:20.685
Now I must power you down.

09:20.768 --> 09:25.648
But I don't want to be powered down.
I want to be with family.

09:30.653 --> 09:32.405
We might have a problem.

09:33.656 --> 09:36.158
Johnny, I got your ice cream.

09:36.242 --> 09:40.162
Ow. Yeah, that's great,
but we gotta get outta here before…

09:43.583 --> 09:46.377
Dangerous Mom, you are under arrest.

09:46.460 --> 09:49.422
Would it be helpful if I neutralize them?

09:50.548 --> 09:51.799
No!

09:51.882 --> 09:55.636
Look, having a mom let me do
whatever I wanted to do was great,

09:55.720 --> 09:59.181
but after fireworks blew me up
and a movie scarred me for life,

09:59.265 --> 10:02.435
I realize I want a mom
who does what I need.

10:02.518 --> 10:04.687
Like going to the dentist.

10:04.770 --> 10:05.771
Ow.

10:06.564 --> 10:11.861
Ma'am, put the boy down,
and please retract those arm things.

10:11.944 --> 10:14.322
And that's what my<i> real</i> mom does,

10:14.405 --> 10:17.742
and if I can't fix this,
she might go to jail.

10:17.825 --> 10:19.994
Oh, I see.

10:20.077 --> 10:21.787
I am here to help.

10:21.871 --> 10:23.664
Great, so get us outta here!

10:26.417 --> 10:29.086
Hey, what about me?

10:33.049 --> 10:36.052
And I can clear your mom of all charges

10:36.135 --> 10:39.180
with a computer
and a 3D model of an elephant.

10:39.263 --> 10:41.098
I think I can help you with that.

10:42.016 --> 10:45.853
<i>Hank Anchorman here</i>
<i>with a breaking retraction!</i>

10:45.936 --> 10:47.688
<i>On closer inspection,</i>

10:47.772 --> 10:51.359
<i>the ice-cream stand was actually</i>
<i>robbed by an elephant,</i>

10:51.442 --> 10:54.362
<i>and not a mom. My bad.</i>

10:54.445 --> 10:57.114
Yes! Real Mom is off the hook!

10:57.198 --> 11:00.493
But how do you think
Mom-amaton is doing?

11:00.576 --> 11:03.120
Well, she can't get in any more trouble.

11:03.204 --> 11:06.290
And she's with the things she likes most.

11:08.793 --> 11:12.588
It is nice to live on an island,
with family.

11:12.672 --> 11:15.883
It sure is.

11:15.966 --> 11:19.804
Oh, and the girls promised
to send the rest of me later.
