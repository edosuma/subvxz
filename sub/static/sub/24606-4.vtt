41:25.840 --> 41:28.958
Now, pick it up.

41:29.040 --> 41:31.475
Do you know why
those people were in there?

41:32.800 --> 41:34.359
Because of me.

41:34.440 --> 41:36.511
| blinded them when I was a Colt,

41:36.600 --> 41:39.274
following my Regent's orders,
who was following our Baron's orders.

41:39.360 --> 41:41.192
Blood for blood.

41:41.280 --> 41:44.352
But I will not continue
that cycle with you, Nathaniel.

41:48.440 --> 41:49.794
(EXHALES)

41:51.960 --> 41:53.871
I'm not going to fight you.

41:54.960 --> 41:56.917
And neither will Bajie.

41:58.280 --> 42:00.749
This is yours.

42:00.840 --> 42:03.559
How you use it is up to you,
but if you kill me,

42:03.640 --> 42:07.270
my son is your responsibility.

42:07.360 --> 42:09.920
Maybe you can find your honor in that.

42:11.840 --> 42:13.035
(GRUNTS)

42:17.440 --> 42:19.033
(HENRY COOING)

42:19.120 --> 42:20.633
| can't, Sunny.

42:22.200 --> 42:24.840
| can't deny your son the chance
that was denied mine.

42:29.600 --> 42:31.511
To grow up with his father.

42:34.200 --> 42:36.669
-SUNNY: So we're good?
-Yeah.

42:36.760 --> 42:38.433
My honor's been satisfied.

42:38.520 --> 42:40.875
But the Widow still wants your head.

42:40.960 --> 42:43.429
Don't come back to the Badlands.

42:44.440 --> 42:45.839
Understood.

42:50.840 --> 42:52.035
(HENRY COOING)

42:59.440 --> 43:02.193
First, we survive blind cannibals,

43:02.280 --> 43:04.556
then Moon decides not to kill us.

43:04.640 --> 43:06.916
Maybe miracles do happen.

43:10.160 --> 43:12.436
Yeah.

43:12.520 --> 43:14.750
Maybe.

43:22.360 --> 43:24.192
