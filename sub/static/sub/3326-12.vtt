00:01.085 --> 00:02.461
Previously on Teen Wolf...

00:02.670 --> 00:04.956
It's a dead pool.
A hit list of supernatural creatures.

00:05.173 --> 00:07.630
Why would someone
use all this money just to kill us?

00:07.967 --> 00:10.458
- I know exactly who The Benefactor is.
- Meredith.

00:10.678 --> 00:11.793
It was your idea.

00:12.096 --> 00:13.927
I will take out all of them!

00:17.268 --> 00:18.383
Is it over?

00:18.603 --> 00:20.764
- I'm not a murderer.
- But you are a predator.

00:20.980 --> 00:22.936
- My strength, the healing. All of it.
- Gone?

00:23.107 --> 00:25.063
Whatever Kate did to me,
it's still happening.

00:26.402 --> 00:28.017
Banshees predict death.

00:28.196 --> 00:29.356
You wanna bail on the plan.

00:36.204 --> 00:37.444
We're all going to church!

00:37.663 --> 00:38.869
Mexico.

00:39.832 --> 00:40.912
Scott!

00:41.125 --> 00:42.331
You ever heard of the Berserkers?

00:42.543 --> 00:44.659
They wore the skins of bears
to channel their ferocity.

00:44.837 --> 00:46.543
No, Kate. Don't. No!

01:41.143 --> 01:42.269
Scott?

01:56.492 --> 01:57.607
Scott?

03:39.887 --> 03:43.630
I'm going to have
to do a better job of covering that up.

03:46.310 --> 03:47.641
What did you do to him?

03:48.396 --> 03:49.431
How.

03:50.481 --> 03:52.972
That's... That's the better story.

03:53.776 --> 03:55.641
You see, when I first
got away from the Calaveras,

03:55.861 --> 03:57.817
I had no idea where to go.

03:58.572 --> 04:01.735
But something
kept pulling me here,

04:03.369 --> 04:06.156
to the temple of Tezcatlipoca.

04:08.666 --> 04:10.406
His name means "smoking mirror"

04:10.626 --> 04:12.162
and this place

04:12.670 --> 04:14.956
is a temple of the smoking mirror.

04:20.428 --> 04:21.634
Obsidian.

04:27.184 --> 04:30.426
When I got here,
I found the Berserkers waiting for me.

04:30.813 --> 04:32.303
They helped me survive.

04:32.523 --> 04:34.809
I didn't know quite why

04:35.192 --> 04:36.728
until just recently.

04:39.071 --> 04:41.357
Until I decided to trust someone

04:41.657 --> 04:43.318
I never thought I'd trust.

04:43.743 --> 04:45.734
It was then that I found out

04:46.036 --> 04:47.776
I could not only control the Berserkers,

04:47.997 --> 04:51.455
but I could create them.

04:53.961 --> 04:55.917
They call me La Loba.

04:56.422 --> 04:57.912
"The Bone Woman."

04:58.966 --> 05:01.673
We let you out
because I needed to test his loyalty.

05:03.345 --> 05:05.552
Did you know
that Scott became an Alpha

05:05.765 --> 05:07.255
without having to kill anyone?

05:08.142 --> 05:10.804
He's been through
quite a lot without ever having to kill.

05:14.356 --> 05:16.517
I think it's time to change that.

05:21.655 --> 05:23.441
No. No, Scott.

05:25.743 --> 05:27.449
No, Scott, no.

06:16.502 --> 06:18.788
You are not going to Mexico.

06:19.004 --> 06:22.622
Dad, Scott and Kira have been kidnapped
and taken to Mexico. Okay?

06:22.842 --> 06:25.709
I think that's a pretty good reason
for a trip to Mexico.

06:26.804 --> 06:27.884
Okay.

06:28.097 --> 06:30.463
Even if Deaton is right about this,

06:30.683 --> 06:33.049
the best thing to do is
to go through the proper channels.

06:33.269 --> 06:34.258
- Dad...
- That means

06:34.436 --> 06:36.267
calling the right
law enforcement agencies,

06:36.480 --> 06:38.436
border patrol,
putting out an all-points.

06:38.649 --> 06:40.935
Dad, I can't just wait around
for the wheels of bureaucracy

06:41.151 --> 06:43.278
to start spinning
in five different government offices. Okay?

06:43.487 --> 06:46.479
Someone needs to go down there
right now, find them and rescue them.

06:46.657 --> 06:47.988
I'm going.

06:48.659 --> 06:50.490
I can keep you from going.

06:50.744 --> 06:52.280
I'd find a way.

06:52.663 --> 06:55.450
- I can throw you in a cell.
- I'd still find a way.

06:56.625 --> 06:59.913
Stiles, please.
Look, just give me a little more time

07:00.129 --> 07:02.461
to verify something
slightly more concrete

07:02.673 --> 07:05.665
than a psychic vision
by some guy with a third eye!

07:06.677 --> 07:09.384
Look, I will call every law
enforcement agency

07:09.555 --> 07:12.171
all the way down
to South America if I have to.

07:12.600 --> 07:14.465
If nothing turns up,

07:14.685 --> 07:16.676
then I'll book two flights to Mexico.

07:17.605 --> 07:19.186
We'll both go. Okay?

07:19.398 --> 07:22.060
Okay, okay, great.
Do I get a gun?

07:23.903 --> 07:24.892
No.

07:27.573 --> 07:29.655
I still don't like
relying on these things.

07:30.117 --> 07:32.699
| get it. You miss your power.

07:33.454 --> 07:34.819
I would, too.

07:35.915 --> 07:38.031
It's not about power,
it's about being able to help.

07:38.250 --> 07:39.956
I don't like feeling helpless.

07:40.836 --> 07:42.246
I'm human.

07:43.130 --> 07:44.995
Do I look helpless?

07:45.424 --> 07:47.631
You're a much better shot than me.

07:50.721 --> 07:52.962
Do you really think
you won't be coming back?

07:53.807 --> 07:55.388
Not alive.

07:58.771 --> 08:00.978
You know I'm not okay with that.

08:16.664 --> 08:17.699
lam.

08:23.545 --> 08:25.501
If it saves Scott and Kira.

08:29.385 --> 08:31.296
But to be honest, I don't even know
if this is enough firepower

08:31.512 --> 08:32.922
to take down one Berserker.

08:33.138 --> 08:34.924
Not even close.

08:37.017 --> 08:40.259
Killing a Berserker
is next to impossible.

08:40.729 --> 08:42.105
It's not just the firepower,

08:42.314 --> 08:45.602
it's breaking the animal spirit
from the human.

08:45.818 --> 08:49.231
Well, the one person we know
with that kind of experience is Argent.

08:49.446 --> 08:50.947
And he's not getting back to me.

08:51.657 --> 08:53.648
Well, then you're going to need help.

08:53.867 --> 08:55.994
Like Malia, maybe Liam.

08:56.328 --> 08:57.613
Definitely me.

09:02.334 --> 09:03.619
Here, try that.

09:04.211 --> 09:05.246
Fabric softener.

09:16.348 --> 09:18.213
Remember, Scott's life is on the line.

09:25.441 --> 09:26.977
Yeah. That works, too.

09:32.197 --> 09:34.779
Oh! Liam, go home.
You're not coming with us.

09:34.992 --> 09:36.653
- Why not?
- Because it's a full moon.

09:36.869 --> 09:38.825
And I don't feel like
driving all the way down to Mexico

09:38.996 --> 09:41.408
- just to have you rip my throat out.
- You can lock me up, right?

09:41.582 --> 09:42.867
Chain me down
to the back seat or something?

09:43.125 --> 09:44.581
You tore through
the last chains, remember?

09:44.752 --> 09:47.539
Yeah, we would have to freeze you
in carbonite to get you down there.

09:48.297 --> 09:50.629
Okay, then where do we get carbonite?

09:53.010 --> 09:55.626
Seriously, you haven't seen it either?

09:57.306 --> 09:58.295
Wait!

10:00.267 --> 10:02.929
- What if we put me in the trunk?
- You'd get out of that, too.

10:03.145 --> 10:05.261
Liam, you've been a werewolf
all of five minutes.

10:05.439 --> 10:08.602
- You don't have to do this.
- I know I don't, but I want to.

10:09.109 --> 10:10.315
There's gotta be bigger chains,

10:10.527 --> 10:12.142
a bigger trunk or something.
There has to be.

10:13.739 --> 10:15.320
Maybe there is.

10:24.541 --> 10:26.577
How did you get
a prison transport van?

10:26.794 --> 10:28.204
I'm a U.S. Marshal.

10:28.420 --> 10:30.832
Yeah, ljust thought
that was just a cover.

10:32.091 --> 10:33.297
Are we really bringing him?

10:34.384 --> 10:35.635
Are we really bringing him?

10:35.803 --> 10:37.464
We're bringing everyone that we can.

10:37.679 --> 10:40.011
And considering Scott and Kira
were taken the night before a full moon,

10:40.224 --> 10:42.931
- we should probably get going.
- What's that mean?

10:43.143 --> 10:45.759
If Kate took Scott back
to the same temple that she took Derek,

10:45.979 --> 10:48.265
how do we know she's not planning to
do the same thing to him?

10:49.108 --> 10:50.598
What, she wants to make him younger?

10:50.818 --> 10:52.729
Or take him back to when
he wasn't a werewolf.

10:53.320 --> 10:55.811
A werewolf can't steal
a true Alpha's power.

10:56.031 --> 10:57.737
But maybe a Nagual jaguar,

10:57.950 --> 11:00.692
with the power of
Tezcatlipoca behind her...

11:00.869 --> 11:02.075
Maybe she can.

11:03.080 --> 11:05.696
So, if everyone is
sufficiently freaked out,

11:05.874 --> 11:07.990
- I say we get going.
- We can't.

11:09.002 --> 11:10.617
Not without Lydia.

11:23.308 --> 11:24.844
I hope this works.

11:36.738 --> 11:38.353
What's she doing
at the school anyway?

11:39.032 --> 11:41.284
We got Kira's sword, but we need
something with a stronger scent.

11:41.493 --> 11:43.870
Lydia went to get a jacket
out of her locker.

11:44.329 --> 11:46.069
- Nothing.
- If she has a car,

11:46.248 --> 11:48.614
- she can catch up to us.
- That's a good point.

11:48.834 --> 11:50.495
- We'll call her from the road.
- No. What if something happened?

11:50.711 --> 11:53.453
- What if she's in trouble?
- Fine. You stay, you find her.

11:53.672 --> 11:55.628
We're gonna go on without you.

11:56.133 --> 11:57.464
I could call Mason.

11:57.676 --> 11:59.632
He has a study group at school.
Maybe he could look for her.

12:02.514 --> 12:03.629
All right. Fine.

12:06.143 --> 12:07.929
I need to be back there
with Derek and Liam.

12:08.145 --> 12:10.136
I've got some experience
dealing with out-of-control teen wolves.

12:10.397 --> 12:12.479
You're gonna be okay
riding with Peter?

12:12.691 --> 12:14.852
He is my father.
Maybe we could do some bonding.

12:15.068 --> 12:16.444
No. No bonding.

12:16.653 --> 12:18.029
Play the radio, play it loud.

12:22.326 --> 12:24.612
It's not just Kate,
it's Berserkers.

12:24.828 --> 12:26.568
You might see human eyes
behind those skulls.

12:26.788 --> 12:29.074
Do not assume that
there's any humanity left.

12:30.375 --> 12:33.242
Oh. This little one
is terrified of them, aren't you?

12:34.504 --> 12:37.337
Don't worry, my friend.
It is that fear that will keep you alive.

12:37.841 --> 12:39.251
A reminder to everyone.

12:39.468 --> 12:41.959
You do not fight Berserkers to survive,

12:42.679 --> 12:44.260
you fight to kill.

12:59.529 --> 13:01.235
Yeah, her car's here.

13:02.115 --> 13:04.276
You want me to look around the school
and see if I can find her?

13:04.493 --> 13:07.235
Yeah, definitely.
Call me as soon as you find her.

13:20.050 --> 13:21.085
All good?

13:23.679 --> 13:26.466
- Okay.
- I brought something to help you.

13:29.476 --> 13:31.592
This has been with my family
for centuries.

13:32.688 --> 13:35.100
It's a very powerful,
supernatural talisman.

13:35.315 --> 13:38.022
We use to teach Betas how to
control themselves on a full moon.

13:50.539 --> 13:52.871
Yes, it's powerful.

13:53.083 --> 13:54.619
Very powerful.

14:05.345 --> 14:06.630
Lydia?

14:22.446 --> 14:24.607
No wonder she's not answering.

14:27.659 --> 14:28.819
What the hell?

14:42.841 --> 14:44.923
Do you mind if I turn the radio down?

14:52.100 --> 14:54.011
You worried about Stiles?

14:55.020 --> 14:57.011
I'm worried about everyone.

14:58.398 --> 15:00.605
Do I need to be worried about you?

15:01.777 --> 15:04.439
We have to go through the Berserkers
to get to Kate.

15:04.654 --> 15:07.236
Then we have to go through Kate
to get to Scott and Kira.

15:07.449 --> 15:10.065
Trust me,
it's going to get messy.

15:10.619 --> 15:12.701
Scott says we don't kill people.

15:15.665 --> 15:19.078
You think
Scott would kill to save Kira?

15:20.629 --> 15:21.789
Would you?

15:22.881 --> 15:24.382
Kill to save Stiles?

15:27.969 --> 15:28.958
What is it?

15:30.764 --> 15:31.970
The full moon.

15:32.682 --> 15:33.637
Good.

15:34.976 --> 15:36.557
You'll need that power.

15:46.279 --> 15:47.985
Whatever you were gonna teach me...

15:51.618 --> 15:53.233
I think you better start.

16:09.010 --> 16:11.262
It's all right to cry.

16:12.931 --> 16:15.343
It's no measure of your strength.

16:17.644 --> 16:19.180
But I'm not strong.

16:19.938 --> 16:21.439
I need to get up.

16:21.648 --> 16:23.764
I need to tell them...

16:24.568 --> 16:26.183
How do you know you can't?

16:26.653 --> 16:28.609
Because I'm not healing.

16:30.157 --> 16:32.443
You told me why I never get sick.

16:32.659 --> 16:34.399
And you said I'd learn to heal.

16:35.912 --> 16:37.288
Then learn.

16:37.873 --> 16:39.113
I can't.

16:40.667 --> 16:42.248
I don't know how,

16:42.836 --> 16:43.996
how to start,

16:44.212 --> 16:45.918
or what to do.

16:46.131 --> 16:50.124
I told you once that foxes
and wolves tend not to get along.

16:50.469 --> 16:53.211
But they are
similar creatures, aren't they?

16:53.805 --> 16:55.670
You've seen wolves heal.

16:56.433 --> 16:58.094
How do they do it?

16:58.852 --> 16:59.932
Kira,

17:00.979 --> 17:02.935
how do they trigger it?

17:06.193 --> 17:07.649
Pain.

17:07.944 --> 17:09.320
With pain.

17:57.160 --> 17:58.400
Are you okay?

17:59.788 --> 18:02.905
- My head... Oh.
- Yeah, it's probably gonna hurt a lot.

18:03.583 --> 18:06.996
There was this guy.
Huge, really huge.

18:07.212 --> 18:09.168
He had a, a skull on his face.

18:09.381 --> 18:11.246
Yeah. I know. I saw it, too.

18:11.716 --> 18:14.549
- My phone's gone.
- Yeah. I think that's the point.

18:14.886 --> 18:16.968
Okay. Well, wait,
what's he gonna do to us?

18:17.472 --> 18:21.260
I don't know. But it definitely
doesn't want us to leave.

18:21.476 --> 18:23.216
Lydia, why do you keep saying "it"?

18:34.072 --> 18:35.573
What is that thing?

18:42.664 --> 18:43.904
Not human.

18:52.299 --> 18:55.257
Liam, you with me?
We have a mantra that we use.

18:55.468 --> 18:57.925
You repeat it, you focus on the words.
It's like meditating.

18:58.096 --> 19:00.428
You say the words until
you feel control coming back to you.

19:00.682 --> 19:02.343
Okay. Okay, okay!
What are the words?

19:02.517 --> 19:04.178
Okay, look at the triskelion.
See the symbol?

19:04.394 --> 19:06.134
l have a tattoo on my back,
it's the same thing.

19:06.313 --> 19:08.599
Each spiral means something.

19:08.815 --> 19:10.055
Alpha, Beta, Omega.

19:10.275 --> 19:12.140
It represents the idea
that we can always rise

19:12.319 --> 19:15.231
to one and fall back to another.
Betas can become Alphas.

19:15.447 --> 19:17.813
- Alphas can become Betas.
- Can Alphas become Omegas?

19:19.659 --> 19:21.741
All you have to do is
say the three words.

19:21.911 --> 19:23.822
And with each one, you tell yourself
you're getting calmer,

19:24.039 --> 19:25.199
more in control.

19:26.041 --> 19:26.996
Go ahead.

19:28.293 --> 19:29.874
- Alpha, Beta...
- Slower.

19:31.630 --> 19:33.791
Alpha... Beta...

19:34.466 --> 19:35.421
Omega...

19:37.844 --> 19:38.924
Alpha...

19:39.846 --> 19:41.382
Beta...

19:41.598 --> 19:43.259
- Omega...
- Good. Say it again.

19:43.475 --> 19:46.467
Remember, every time you say
the words, you're getting calmer.

19:46.686 --> 19:49.348
Alpha, Beta...

19:49.564 --> 19:50.428
Whoa, whoa.

19:50.649 --> 19:52.059
- Omega.
- Say it again.

19:52.359 --> 19:55.476
Derek, I don't think the powerful talisman
of self-control is working.

19:58.573 --> 19:59.562
Liam, say it again!

20:02.077 --> 20:03.237
Liam!

20:06.331 --> 20:07.446
Whoa.

20:09.542 --> 20:10.622
Whoa!

20:11.044 --> 20:11.829
Derek?

20:12.003 --> 20:14.380
I think we're gonna
need to go a little faster.

20:21.262 --> 20:22.172
Keep going!

20:27.727 --> 20:28.842
Liam!

20:29.604 --> 20:30.639
Liam...

20:31.189 --> 20:32.520
We're almost there.

20:37.153 --> 20:38.484
You're trying to stay in control?

20:39.030 --> 20:40.145
Trying to stay human.

20:42.784 --> 20:45.992
That's exactly your problem.
Scott has you thinking

20:46.204 --> 20:49.162
that control and humanity
are the same for us.

20:49.332 --> 20:50.993
Allow me to give you
some fatherly advice.

20:51.167 --> 20:55.126
If you're gonna face something as animal
as a Berserker and try to win,

20:55.672 --> 20:57.958
you need to focus on
the animal inside you.

20:58.216 --> 21:01.629
You'll need every ounce of ferocity
and savagery you can muster.

21:01.845 --> 21:03.335
You'll need it all.

21:05.140 --> 21:06.346
Keep focus!

21:06.516 --> 21:09.132
Derek, I don't think "Alpha, Beta, Omega"
is resonating with him.

21:09.352 --> 21:10.933
You know any other mantras?

21:12.856 --> 21:14.312
Yeah. I do.

21:14.482 --> 21:15.688
Liam, Liam.

21:16.317 --> 21:18.444
What three things
cannot long be hidden?

21:21.406 --> 21:22.486
Liam!

21:23.658 --> 21:26.400
Liam, look at me.
What three things cannot long be hidden?

21:27.245 --> 21:28.860
What three things?

21:31.624 --> 21:33.034
Sun...

21:33.752 --> 21:35.083
The moon...

21:36.045 --> 21:38.422
- The truth.
- That's it. Say it again.

21:40.800 --> 21:43.462
Sun, the moon...

21:44.596 --> 21:45.551
The truth.

21:46.765 --> 21:47.720
Derek?

21:51.728 --> 21:52.934
We're okay.

21:53.146 --> 21:54.226
Sun...

21:55.023 --> 21:56.183
Moon...

21:57.734 --> 21:58.723
And the truth.

22:21.758 --> 22:23.294
I can't believe I did it.

22:24.928 --> 22:27.385
For a minute there, I thought I was gonna
tear the two of you apart.

22:28.765 --> 22:31.973
Yeah. That would've made
for an awkward ride home. So, thanks.

22:32.185 --> 22:33.595
Think you can bring
the same level of control

22:33.812 --> 22:35.268
and strength inside La lglesia?

22:40.902 --> 22:43.689
All right.
We might actually be able to do this.

23:27.824 --> 23:28.813
How bad is it?

23:29.075 --> 23:31.532
I'm fine, I'm fine. Just get to Scott.

23:34.455 --> 23:37.242
Just find him.
We'll be right behind you.

23:37.500 --> 23:38.660
Go.

23:40.670 --> 23:41.705
Go!

23:47.343 --> 23:50.255
Hey, hey, save him.

24:11.075 --> 24:12.281
This way.

24:20.627 --> 24:22.242
Lydia was right.

24:32.388 --> 24:34.595
Okay, everyone stop,
stop, stop, stop, stop.

24:34.807 --> 24:36.138
We gotta figure out where we are,

24:36.351 --> 24:38.182
then we gotta figure out
how to find Scott and Kira.

24:42.649 --> 24:45.265
How do I even have service...
Hi, Dad.

24:47.320 --> 24:48.901
Okay, Dad, I know you're angry.

24:49.113 --> 24:51.104
Oh, I'm beyond angry.

24:51.324 --> 24:52.780
I've reached a level of fury

24:52.992 --> 24:55.483
that you could
not possibly comprehend.

24:55.662 --> 24:57.368
Okay, well, when I get back,
you can ground me.

24:57.622 --> 24:59.362
Ground you? Ground you?

24:59.666 --> 25:02.203
I'm going to hobble you!

25:05.004 --> 25:07.916
Now, please, tell me you're all right.

25:08.257 --> 25:09.918
Tell me that you're safe.

25:10.134 --> 25:11.635
You want me to lie?

25:12.095 --> 25:13.460
Oh, God.

25:13.680 --> 25:17.389
Okay. Tell me, tell me what I can do.
How can I help?

25:18.059 --> 25:20.266
She was at the school
when we called Mason to look for her,

25:20.478 --> 25:22.014
but now we're not
hearing back from either of them.

25:22.230 --> 25:23.720
I don't know, Dad,
I don't know what I'm doin'.

25:23.940 --> 25:25.476
You know, I'm just...
I'm trying to save my friends.

25:25.650 --> 25:26.605
Okay.

25:27.735 --> 25:29.111
I'll find Lydia and Mason.

25:29.654 --> 25:31.360
You get Scott and Kira.

25:31.656 --> 25:33.487
You save your friends.

25:34.409 --> 25:36.491
Dad, if it's one of
the Berserkers at the school,

25:37.203 --> 25:39.819
you're gonna need firepower. A lot.

25:43.126 --> 25:44.582
What do we do now?

25:46.254 --> 25:47.539
Duck.

25:47.714 --> 25:51.081
Get down. Go, go, go.
Whoa! Get back!

25:51.676 --> 25:53.257
Get back! Go!
Go, go, go, go!

25:56.681 --> 25:58.262
Can you still pull a trigger?

25:58.474 --> 25:59.554
Yeah.

26:00.685 --> 26:01.640
All right.

26:01.853 --> 26:04.265
Stay with me.
You're gonna be okay.

26:04.647 --> 26:06.433
It's a mortal wound.

26:06.649 --> 26:09.140
And right now I'm feeling pretty mortal.

26:10.361 --> 26:12.192
I'm not gonna let you die.

26:20.413 --> 26:24.326
Yeah, you mightjust
have to concentrate on saving yourself.

27:07.126 --> 27:08.081
I don't hear it.

27:10.713 --> 27:11.828
- Come on.
- No, no.

27:12.048 --> 27:14.209
There's only one way out
on this side of the basement.

27:14.425 --> 27:15.505
I know.

27:15.718 --> 27:17.674
But if we don't get out of here,
someone's going to die.

27:17.970 --> 27:20.256
- How do you know that?
- ljust do.

27:21.057 --> 27:23.218
We have to at least see
if he's blocking the exit.

27:36.948 --> 27:39.155
Yeah. Yeah, he's blockin' it.

27:41.369 --> 27:42.654
Go, go, go!

27:46.624 --> 27:47.784
Go find Kira and Scott.

27:48.626 --> 27:49.581
Go!

28:16.529 --> 28:18.065
How much did they pay you?

28:18.656 --> 28:20.738
Way more than you're worth.

28:55.693 --> 28:56.728
Scott?

28:58.112 --> 28:59.101
Kira?

29:08.956 --> 29:10.036
Oh.

29:11.209 --> 29:14.201
- Are you okay?
- It's Scott. Stiles, it's Scott.

29:14.420 --> 29:16.251
- What?
- The Berserker. It's him.

29:16.464 --> 29:18.045
- Kate did it.
- What are you talking about?

29:18.257 --> 29:21.044
She made him into one of them.
I don't know how, but it's him.

29:21.260 --> 29:23.125
If they don't know it,
they could kill him.

29:24.597 --> 29:26.588
That's why Lydia's not here.

29:26.933 --> 29:29.219
They won't know they're killing Scott.

30:13.938 --> 30:15.553
Derek?

30:16.816 --> 30:18.056
Derek?

30:26.826 --> 30:27.906
Derek?

30:42.008 --> 30:43.839
- Are you serious?
- Very.

30:44.635 --> 30:46.671
A baseball bat?
Against that guy?

30:47.305 --> 30:49.216
Or thing or whatever it is.

30:50.391 --> 30:53.383
My friends are in trouble.
And so is Liam, your best friend.

30:54.562 --> 30:56.393
They need me. I'm going for it.

30:58.399 --> 31:00.264
And yes, with a baseball bat.

31:23.549 --> 31:26.632
I thought you said it wanted to
keep us here, not hurt us.

31:26.844 --> 31:29.051
- I think it changed its mind.
- Excuse me.

31:29.513 --> 31:30.502
Catch.

31:55.873 --> 31:57.283
You both okay?

32:07.051 --> 32:08.507
It was after me.

32:09.887 --> 32:12.003
It wanted me to stay in Beacon Hills.

32:12.515 --> 32:16.099
I think this was all
some sort of distraction.

32:16.310 --> 32:17.811
Because you knew

32:18.020 --> 32:19.556
they're trying to kill someone.

32:20.606 --> 32:21.686
Kill who?

32:25.111 --> 32:26.226
Scott.

32:46.173 --> 32:47.913
Take him. Aim for the skull!

32:48.551 --> 32:50.792
Kill it. Kill it now!

32:51.846 --> 32:53.757
No, wait, wait. Malia, wait!

33:01.439 --> 33:03.851
It's Scott. It's Scott.

33:21.208 --> 33:23.199
Scott? Scott, don't!

33:24.086 --> 33:25.292
Scott, it's me.

33:29.300 --> 33:30.255
Scott, don't!

33:35.806 --> 33:36.761
Scott.

34:41.497 --> 34:42.703
They're not going down!

34:42.915 --> 34:45.156
Nothing's getting through that armor
and I'm running out of ammo.

35:02.518 --> 35:04.179
Scott, Scott, listen, listen, listen!

35:05.646 --> 35:07.307
You're not a monster!

35:10.693 --> 35:12.399
You're a werewolf!

35:13.487 --> 35:14.567
Like me.

36:25.851 --> 36:26.886
You.

36:34.109 --> 36:37.442
The only one who knew
as much as Argent about Berserkers.

36:37.655 --> 36:39.111
About the Nagual.

36:40.658 --> 36:42.990
You taught Kate. You helped her.

36:44.453 --> 36:45.659
All for power.

36:45.871 --> 36:48.453
For my family's power.

36:48.666 --> 36:51.373
To be rightfully inherited by me.

36:52.294 --> 36:56.458
Not usurped
by some idiot teenage boy,

36:56.674 --> 36:59.586
so incorruptible, he wouldn't shed
the blood of his enemies

36:59.802 --> 37:01.463
even when justified.

37:02.680 --> 37:04.671
You don't deserve your power.

37:06.266 --> 37:07.881
Not power like this.

37:24.076 --> 37:27.364
I'm sorry, sweetheart,
we'll talk about this later.

37:29.748 --> 37:31.204
Kira!

37:41.093 --> 37:43.835
You were my Beta first, Scott.

37:45.973 --> 37:49.306
It was my bite that changed your life.

37:50.686 --> 37:54.224
And my bite that can end it.

37:58.736 --> 38:01.148
Because you won't get another chance.

38:30.184 --> 38:31.640
You're next, Araya.

38:32.519 --> 38:34.430
I'm coming to kill you next.

38:35.773 --> 38:37.309
Come, La Loba.

38:37.524 --> 38:40.266
Let me show you
how the Calaveras die.

39:48.720 --> 39:51.507
You were... You were dead.

39:52.933 --> 39:53.888
No.

39:55.310 --> 39:56.641
I was evolving.

39:59.022 --> 40:00.933
Something you'll never do.

40:36.810 --> 40:37.765
Chris?

41:02.794 --> 41:03.829
Come on, Scott.

41:06.340 --> 41:07.455
Come on!

41:12.220 --> 41:13.505
Come on.

41:18.518 --> 41:20.054
Fight like an Alpha.

41:54.471 --> 41:56.177
You want to beat me?

41:56.390 --> 42:00.178
You're going to have to kill me!

43:26.021 --> 43:28.182
You were never an Alpha, Peter.

43:30.442 --> 43:32.603
But you were always a monster.

44:22.077 --> 44:23.817
You want to kill me, Chris?

44:24.913 --> 44:25.993
No.

44:27.749 --> 44:30.456
But I don't want to
save you anymore either.

44:32.170 --> 44:34.627
I don't know that you're worth saving.

44:35.799 --> 44:38.165
It's just like when we were kids.

44:39.177 --> 44:41.668
Always trying to make me the bad guy.

44:43.140 --> 44:45.847
You can't see them
clearly anymore, can you?

44:46.893 --> 44:48.929
Scott's not your little hero.

44:49.604 --> 44:51.140
None of 'em are.

44:54.401 --> 44:56.483
Not when they killed Allison.

45:09.958 --> 45:11.448
Allison died.

45:13.461 --> 45:16.123
She died saving her friends.

45:18.216 --> 45:20.707
Who would you die for? Hmm?

45:23.180 --> 45:25.216
You're not gonna kill me.

45:28.518 --> 45:30.634
And you're not gonna catch me.

45:31.646 --> 45:33.227
Not you.

45:34.566 --> 45:37.057
Not Peter. And not the Calaveras.

45:57.631 --> 46:00.623
There's enough yellow wolfsbane
to keep Peter out for the trip back.

46:01.426 --> 46:02.711
But be careful.

46:03.595 --> 46:05.210
You're really going with them?

46:07.224 --> 46:09.340
I made a deal with
the Calaveras weeks ago.

46:09.643 --> 46:10.803
They'll leave you alone.

46:11.645 --> 46:12.725
All of you.

46:14.814 --> 46:16.679
But only it! help them catch Kate.

46:17.234 --> 46:18.565
What if you can't?

46:19.402 --> 46:22.235
I'll find her. Someone has to.

46:51.643 --> 46:54.259
So you're not really
a U.S. Marshal, are you?

46:54.854 --> 46:58.438
I was. But I spent too long
looking for one person.

46:58.650 --> 47:00.936
It's hard to keep a job
when part of it becomes an obsession.

47:01.611 --> 47:02.566
Who were you after?

47:02.988 --> 47:04.944
All I know is a code name.

47:05.699 --> 47:07.314
The Desert Wolf.

47:42.610 --> 47:44.475
Dad, you smell terrible.

47:45.739 --> 47:47.479
Yup. You do too.

47:51.161 --> 47:52.241
Hi, Malia.

48:00.045 --> 48:02.252
I'm just so glad you're both safe.

48:02.464 --> 48:04.329
Hey, what do you say
we get outta here, get something to eat?

48:04.549 --> 48:06.164
- Great. I'm starving.
- Okay.

48:10.805 --> 48:12.056
Yo, Daddy?

48:12.265 --> 48:14.426
- What's your favorite food?
- Uh, pizza.

48:14.642 --> 48:15.506
Hey.

48:15.977 --> 48:17.057
Dad?

48:22.067 --> 48:23.853
Bring me back a slice?

48:29.240 --> 48:32.323
The shard of obsidian
that you brought back, Kira.

48:32.535 --> 48:33.991
There's a reason you kept it.

48:34.204 --> 48:36.411
And a reason your father
took the liberty of

48:36.623 --> 48:38.534
making an alteration to it.

48:39.501 --> 48:41.162
Do you know what it is?

48:44.547 --> 48:45.582
A tail.

48:47.384 --> 48:48.590
Your first.

48:53.932 --> 48:56.264
Then Stiles said
that Scott and Kira were stuck in Mexico

48:56.476 --> 48:58.387
which was why they missed the game.

48:58.603 --> 49:01.390
Uh, so we went down to Mexico
to drive them back from Mexico

49:01.606 --> 49:03.562
and that's why we all missed practice.

49:04.067 --> 49:05.398
'Cause...

49:06.194 --> 49:09.106
- We were all in Mexico.
- Yeah.

49:11.491 --> 49:14.278
You took Kira on a date to Mexico?

49:17.372 --> 49:19.658
- It was our first real date.
- In Mexico?

49:20.291 --> 49:22.577
They wanted to do something special.

49:24.254 --> 49:25.915
Okay. I believe you.

49:26.131 --> 49:28.588
- Really?
- Absolutely not.

49:30.510 --> 49:32.466
But I've had experiences
south of the border

49:32.637 --> 49:35.344
that would knock
the genitals off you boys.

49:36.141 --> 49:38.177
Still, let me be clear to you two.

49:38.393 --> 49:40.384
This kid's the best talent
I've seen in years.

49:40.603 --> 49:42.559
So he's your responsibility now.

49:42.981 --> 49:45.393
You boys are gonna stick together.
You're gonna look out for each other.

49:45.608 --> 49:48.315
And you're gonna have
each other's backs. You got it?

49:49.863 --> 49:51.023
We got it.

49:54.909 --> 49:56.319
This used to be on a hard drive.

49:56.536 --> 49:58.401
But we eventually
decided it might be a good idea

49:58.621 --> 50:00.577
to have a hard copy around.

50:01.249 --> 50:03.080
So we put it in a book.

50:03.918 --> 50:05.294
What is it?

50:05.670 --> 50:07.626
It's called "The Bestiary."

50:09.549 --> 50:11.289
Whatever you are,

50:11.509 --> 50:12.965
it might be in here.

50:16.222 --> 50:18.508
I'd like to help you figure it out.

50:43.500 --> 50:46.537
You actually think
this is gonna hold me?

50:50.215 --> 50:53.002
You think you can
shoot me up with wolfsbane,

50:53.176 --> 50:54.757
make me docile and weak,

50:54.969 --> 50:57.426
and I won't find a way out?

51:00.642 --> 51:03.054
It's not just the wolfsbane.

51:04.437 --> 51:07.770
It's the mountain ash wood
framework of the cells.

51:09.400 --> 51:10.810
It's all around us.

51:15.323 --> 51:17.279
Who the hell are you?

51:24.457 --> 51:25.913
I could tell you.

51:27.126 --> 51:29.708
But it's easier if I just... show you.
