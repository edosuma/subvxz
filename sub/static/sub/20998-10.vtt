jenn's kids?

03:26.355 --> 03:28.923
What?! Somebody call jenn now!

03:28.958 --> 03:30.491
Roller shot one of the russians.

03:30.526 --> 03:31.959
We saw him. My god.

03:31.994 --> 03:33.472
Jenn's not picking up.
I'm calling bryce.

03:33.496 --> 03:34.895
I'm okay. I'm okay.

03:34.931 --> 03:36.197

Mighty real. Here,
let me help you with that.

04:15.838 --> 04:17.872
You just got to...

04:17.906 --> 04:19.572
Rip it off like a scab.

04:20.910 --> 04:22.543
Or so I've read in books.

04:24.313 --> 04:25.779
You're amazing.

04:25.815 --> 04:27.147
I think you're still seeing me.

04:27.183 --> 04:28.782
Through cumcolored glasses, boo.

04:37.827 --> 04:39.159
Where you going?

04:39.195 --> 04:40.694
You hungry?

04:40.730 --> 04:43.130
For love and affection...
In that order.

04:43.165 --> 04:47.468
Well, we got that here.

05:06.355 --> 05:08.923
Yuri fell.

05:08.958 --> 05:11.091
I'm sorry, mom.

05:11.127 --> 05:14.962
I am not your mother.

05:14.997 --> 05:16.664
This is new yuri.

05:16.699 --> 05:19.400
Your name is yuri now,
understand?

05:19.435 --> 05:20.467
Yes, mother.

05:20.503 --> 05:22.403
I am not your mother.

05:22.438 --> 05:24.204
Congratulations.

05:25.541 --> 05:29.843
These bumbling
cornshuckers need a lesson.

05:29.879 --> 05:31.912
Let's show how we do.

05:31.948 --> 05:33.847
In the other georgia.

05:43.092 --> 05:44.458
Where you at, roller?

05:44.493 --> 05:45.971
Hey, bryce ain't picking up.

05:45.995 --> 05:48.395
Yeah, he's right here.
What's going on?

05:48.431 --> 05:49.930
Hey, where are the girls
right now?

05:49.966 --> 05:51.231
What? With... with jenn.

05:51.267 --> 05:52.633
You got to get 'em.

05:52.668 --> 05:54.301
Why?
Hey, what's going on, roller?

05:54.337 --> 05:56.537
I took one of the russians out.

05:56.539 --> 05:58.439
One of them's still
running around somewhere.

05:58.474 --> 06:00.007
<i>Hey, you got to
get the girls, man.</i>

06:00.042 --> 06:01.976
What?! My... my girls?!
Why, why, why?!

06:02.011 --> 06:03.531
Why, what do they
have to do with this?

06:03.613 --> 06:05.479
Just get the girls!

06:05.514 --> 06:06.547
Damn it, roller.

06:06.582 --> 06:08.148
Jenn's not picking up.

06:08.184 --> 06:09.617
Go deal with that.

06:09.652 --> 06:11.330
You understand what you did,
you dumb idiot?!

06:11.354 --> 06:13.587
God damn it! Hey, miss talmadge.

06:13.623 --> 06:15.289
<i>Get down here

06:15.324 --> 06:16.857
Shit.

06:16.892 --> 06:18.192
Hey, yeah. Can you check to see.

06:18.227 --> 06:20.861
If j... if jenn's car

06:20.896 --> 06:23.497
Okay, could you please go
knock on the door, just in case.

06:23.532 --> 06:24.932
<i>Hey, baby.</i> Hey, baby.

06:24.967 --> 06:27.568
I... I need you to get

06:28.938 --> 06:30.371
Who with?

06:30.406 --> 06:31.472
<i>The russians.</i>

06:31.507 --> 06:32.906
Roller killed one of them.

06:32.942 --> 06:35.209
There's something else
I got to tell you.

06:35.244 --> 06:36.844
Bryce...

06:36.879 --> 06:39.113
Accidentally killed ted
from georgia, so there's...

06:39.148 --> 06:40.247
There's that, too.

06:40.282 --> 06:41.649
What?!

06:41.684 --> 06:43.384
How the hell do you
do that on an accident?

06:43.419 --> 06:45.063
<i>Yeah, well, just don't...
Don't worry about it.</i>

06:45.087 --> 06:46.732
Just get down here.
It's the only place that's safe.

06:46.756 --> 06:48.822
We haven't had a war...

06:48.858 --> 06:50.024
In centuries.

06:50.059 --> 06:52.626
Whoo!
Whoo, I'm a puddle downstairs.

06:52.662 --> 06:54.928
Yeah, well, get your sweet
bony ass over here.

06:54.964 --> 06:56.597

09:12.901 --> 09:14.801
Yeah. You think jenn's with her?

09:14.836 --> 09:15.869
I don't know.

09:15.904 --> 09:18.672
I don't know, I don't know.

09:18.707 --> 09:22.308
Something don't feel right.

09:24.012 --> 09:26.646
Come on, come on, come on,

09:26.682 --> 09:28.281
She ain't picking up. Let's go.

09:28.316 --> 09:31.051

09:48.970 --> 09:50.503
I got shot.

09:50.539 --> 09:53.540
Bryce, your girls

09:53.575 --> 09:55.241
What?! Why?! Go.

09:55.277 --> 09:57.977
Go. Go.

10:00.515 --> 10:03.049
Baby, what happened?

10:03.085 --> 10:05.185
I got one of them.

10:05.220 --> 10:07.654
You did?

10:07.689 --> 10:09.355
That's my girl.

10:15.831 --> 10:17.308
It's o... hey, baby girl,
it's all right.

10:17.332 --> 10:18.598
Don't worry, don't worry.

10:18.633 --> 10:20.967
Where's your sister?
Brienne? Brienne?!

10:21.002 --> 10:25.271
God. Come on.

10:30.345 --> 10:31.656
Let's get you
to a hospital, baby.

10:31.680 --> 10:32.712
Come on now. Come on.

10:32.748 --> 10:34.380
It's too late.

10:34.416 --> 10:36.382
Baby...

10:36.418 --> 10:40.420
no! No, baby, no.

10:40.455 --> 10:46.025
No, no!

10:46.061 --> 10:49.395
My daddy never did
want me to marry you.

10:49.431 --> 10:52.165
Yeah, I know. I know, baby.
I know he didn't.

10:52.200 --> 10:53.967
He said you...

10:54.002 --> 10:57.337
Weren't fit to clean
the cat shit.

10:57.372 --> 10:59.973
Off a possum's dick.

11:00.008 --> 11:06.913
Called you a drunkard
and a cur and cocksucker...

11:06.948 --> 11:10.583
No good reprobate
of a whore's son.

11:10.619 --> 11:13.319
He did?

11:13.355 --> 11:15.155
But...

11:15.190 --> 11:17.157
You were all those things...

11:17.192 --> 11:22.162
And so much more, baby.

11:22.197 --> 11:26.299
I love you, clay!

11:28.236 --> 11:29.869
I always have.

11:29.905 --> 11:32.639
My god! I love you, too, baby.

11:32.674 --> 11:35.942
I'll be right behind you, girl.

11:35.977 --> 11:39.112
You wait for me at those
pearly gates, you hear me?

11:39.147 --> 11:42.649
This world's no place
for me without you.

11:42.684 --> 11:45.552
Shh, baby.

11:45.587 --> 11:47.253
Shh. Please...

11:47.289 --> 11:50.190
You're gonna live.

11:50.225 --> 11:51.324
No.

11:51.359 --> 11:53.860
Shh, it's okay.

11:53.895 --> 11:58.731
You're gonna hurt 'em.

11:58.767 --> 12:03.536
You hurt 'em real...

12:03.572 --> 12:06.406
Really bad.

12:21.489 --> 12:26.693
No, baby, no.

13:01.763 --> 13:03.529
Dean, go in your room.

13:03.565 --> 13:05.665
We got to think.

13:05.700 --> 13:07.600
Where could jenn be?

13:07.636 --> 13:09.947
I don't know. We... we've been
to our old place, our new place.

13:09.971 --> 13:11.804
The fondue place.
The day care center.

13:11.840 --> 13:13.251
Yeah, I'm scared roller's
gonna come in here.

13:13.275 --> 13:14.619
That would be a shitty
move on his part.

13:14.643 --> 13:15.842
I need to talk to you, des.

13:15.877 --> 13:17.143
Not right now, dean.

13:17.178 --> 13:18.711
We're in the middle
of a crisis, baby.

13:18.747 --> 13:19.957
Why was roller
trying to kill you?

13:19.981 --> 13:21.481
Dean, it's a long story.

13:21.516 --> 13:23.316
Yeah, I have time.

13:23.351 --> 13:27.553
Dean, look, okay, roller
was really mad because i...

13:27.589 --> 13:30.290
Because virginia
and I tried to...

13:30.325 --> 13:31.724
Kill him.

13:31.760 --> 13:33.293
That part.

13:33.328 --> 13:37.030
We were really mad at him,
okay, for a lot of reasons.

13:37.065 --> 13:38.776
When... when I was mad
at the coombses, you didn't...

13:38.800 --> 13:39.966
You didn't let me kill them.

13:40.001 --> 13:41.178
I know I didn't,
baby, and I'm sorry.

13:41.202 --> 13:42.702
No, don't be sorry! Do better!

13:42.737 --> 13:44.637
Don't... do better,
dean, do better.

13:44.673 --> 13:47.473
Do better, dean. You should...
Don't be sorry. Do better.

13:47.509 --> 13:49.976
Dean, my life is out of
control right now, but...

13:50.011 --> 13:52.645
Then stop making
stupid life choices!

13:52.681 --> 13:54.013
Dean?!

13:54.049 --> 13:55.548
Shit!

13:57.652 --> 13:59.585
Hello? Where's jenn?

13:59.621 --> 14:01.866
Bryce, I don't know. We've been
looking for her everywhere.

14:01.890 --> 14:04.357
She's not picking up.
They took brienne.

14:04.392 --> 14:05.692
The russians?

14:05.727 --> 14:08.127
Yes! They... they shot juanda.

14:08.163 --> 14:09.662
Shit.

14:09.698 --> 14:11.564
Okay, we...

14:11.599 --> 14:12.765
We will find her.

14:12.801 --> 14:15.702
What, what, what? What is it?!

14:15.737 --> 14:17.904
The russians took
one of jenn's daughters.

14:17.939 --> 14:19.372
What?

14:19.407 --> 14:20.640
Which one?!

14:20.675 --> 14:22.875
Brienne.

14:22.911 --> 14:24.510
The black one, pol.

14:24.546 --> 14:27.080
Shit, and they shot juanda!

14:27.115 --> 14:28.881
Dead? He didn't say.

14:30.385 --> 14:32.418
Okay, you know,
I'm not trying to call jenn out.

14:32.454 --> 14:34.954
Or anything, but she is always
at that messianic place.

14:34.990 --> 14:36.422
Square dancing
with that rabbi dude.

14:36.458 --> 14:39.125
You know, coming back
with that certain smell.

14:39.160 --> 14:43.096
You know, like, yard onions
and conditioner.

14:43.131 --> 14:44.397
Shit.

14:44.432 --> 14:46.499
Watch dean.

14:46.534 --> 14:47.567
I'll be back.

14:47.602 --> 14:49.268
Pol, lock the door.

14:49.304 --> 14:51.404
Be careful.

15:01.816 --> 15:03.116
Hey, des, I...

15:03.151 --> 15:04.517
I need to talk to jenn.

15:04.552 --> 15:05.518
She... now.

15:05.553 --> 15:06.819
She's...

15:06.855 --> 15:08.955
What are you doing here?

15:08.990 --> 15:11.057
Don't judge me.

15:11.092 --> 15:12.725
This is...

15:12.761 --> 15:16.129
I know what it looks like,
but it is, sor... exactly that.

15:16.164 --> 15:18.765
So...

15:18.800 --> 15:21.167
What's going on?

15:21.202 --> 15:23.703
The russians got brienne.

15:25.040 --> 15:26.606
What do you... what do
you mean got her?

15:26.641 --> 15:29.142
I am so, so sorry.

15:29.177 --> 15:31.978
We will get her back,
I promise you, jenn.

15:32.013 --> 15:33.913
This is all because
of what you did!

15:33.948 --> 15:35.181
Every single bit!

15:35.216 --> 15:36.549
Roller's beef with the russians.

15:36.584 --> 15:39.552
Had nothing to do with me,
jenn, you know that!

15:39.587 --> 15:41.387
What are you looking at?!

15:41.423 --> 15:43.790
It's all connected,
one way or the other.

15:43.825 --> 15:45.558
I will fix this shit, I promise.

15:45.593 --> 15:47.660
You goddamn better.

15:49.631 --> 15:51.864
Shit.

15:53.810 --> 15:55.076
Your mama's gonna be here.

15:55.111 --> 15:59.414
Any minute now, okay?
Gonna be okay.

16:00.450 --> 16:01.716
Hey, can you take her.

16:01.751 --> 16:02.895
To uncle daddy's office
for a little nap?

16:02.919 --> 16:04.063
Of course. I love you, darling.

16:04.087 --> 16:05.753
Come on. Hey, pumpkin bear.

16:05.789 --> 16:08.089
Hey, you good?

16:08.124 --> 16:09.257
Yeah?

16:09.292 --> 16:11.893
You doing okay? Yeah.
Where's brienne at?

16:11.928 --> 16:14.729
You tell me, brother.

16:14.764 --> 16:16.064
Where's baylor?

16:16.099 --> 16:18.032
She's in the office.

16:18.068 --> 16:19.601
You can't even look at me?

16:19.636 --> 16:21.302
Shut up, you all.

16:21.338 --> 16:24.772
It's that russian bitch.

16:24.808 --> 16:26.808
Your son is an idiot.

16:26.843 --> 16:28.109
Let me tell you something.

16:28.144 --> 16:30.845
One hair on that
little girl's head...

16:30.880 --> 16:33.281
Soon she won't want to leave.

16:33.316 --> 16:35.683
<i>Let me explain how we do things
here in palmetto,</i>

16:35.719 --> 16:36.751
<i>Putin bitch.</i>

16:36.786 --> 16:38.086
It's an eye for an eye.

16:38.121 --> 16:39.465
I got one of yours,
you got one of mine.

16:39.489 --> 16:40.955
Two of mine.

16:40.991 --> 16:43.524
Two of your cossack henchmen
for the woman of my life.

16:43.560 --> 16:44.659
This is over.

16:44.694 --> 16:45.860
You got my granddaughter.

16:45.895 --> 16:47.595
<i>I want roller's head.</i>

16:47.631 --> 16:50.164
Ask him about olga.

16:50.200 --> 16:51.165
Olga who?

16:51.201 --> 16:53.368
<i>I'm sick of dealing with men.</i>

16:53.403 --> 16:57.372
Send me the manicurist.

17:09.386 --> 17:10.451
Who's olga?

17:10.487 --> 17:12.453
Nobody.

17:12.489 --> 17:16.391
Dirty little russian bitch
I bust a load in.

17:16.425 --> 17:17.892
Met her at their club.

17:17.926 --> 17:21.396
They told me she was 25,
she was 17.

17:21.431 --> 17:22.829
Riva's niece.

17:22.866 --> 17:24.665
You dumb shit.

17:24.701 --> 17:26.134
She had a baby.

17:26.169 --> 17:27.969
Wow. Wwhat were you thinking?!

17:28.003 --> 17:29.804
Since you're a roll...

17:29.839 --> 17:31.939
Why don't you tell him
about the money, roller.

17:31.975 --> 17:35.476
Tell him about that.

17:35.512 --> 17:37.145
They were shaking me down.

17:37.180 --> 17:38.346
How much?

17:38.381 --> 17:39.547
30k a month.

17:39.582 --> 17:40.682
How much total?

17:40.717 --> 17:43.017
About $360,000.

17:43.053 --> 17:45.019
That's... that's
a whole lot of money.

17:45.055 --> 17:48.589
But not all that money went
to the russians, right, roller?

17:48.625 --> 17:49.924
Easy, d.

17:49.959 --> 17:52.894
Not the only little
secret around here.

17:52.929 --> 17:55.463
Where's the money, roller?

17:55.498 --> 17:59.100
Wait, uncle daddy, I'm sorry.

17:59.135 --> 18:00.435
I messed up.

18:00.470 --> 18:02.236
I raised you.

18:02.272 --> 18:03.971
And you betrayed me?

18:04.007 --> 18:09.744
You worthless little
scumsucking...

18:09.779 --> 18:11.713
You want to know something?

18:11.748 --> 18:16.818
Your daddy... he was
a loser, too, just like you.

18:16.853 --> 18:18.286
There, I said it.

18:18.321 --> 18:21.522
One stupidass decision
after another.

18:21.558 --> 18:26.994
Got his country ass shot.

18:27.030 --> 18:30.665
Stupid shit!
You got my daughter kidnapped!

18:36.005 --> 18:37.572
All right, that's enough!

18:37.607 --> 18:39.640
Get off him!

18:44.514 --> 18:46.180
My back! My back!

18:50.387 --> 18:52.253
Your mama's dead
'cause of you, boy!

18:54.891 --> 18:56.224
She was shot by a russian!

19:09.873 --> 19:11.239
Get off of me!

19:18.681 --> 19:19.914
Turn that music off!

19:19.949 --> 19:21.749
What? I can't hear you!

19:21.785 --> 19:23.317
I said turn that
goddamn music off!

19:23.353 --> 19:24.652
I didn't turn it on.

19:24.687 --> 19:27.355
I don't give a shit if you
turned it on! Turn it off!

19:27.390 --> 19:29.056
I don't know how!
It's programmed.

19:29.092 --> 19:31.159
Well, figure it out, you idiot!

19:31.194 --> 19:32.627
Don't call me an idiot!

19:42.839 --> 19:46.407
My eyeball!

19:46.443 --> 19:47.608
Shit!

19:47.644 --> 19:49.277
Come on!

19:49.312 --> 19:50.411
God damn!

19:53.783 --> 19:56.584
Shit, man!

20:04.160 --> 20:07.728
I'm so sorry, uncle daddy.

20:07.764 --> 20:10.031
I'm so sorry.

20:10.066 --> 20:12.800
My boys!

20:12.836 --> 20:14.335
I'm sorry, too, daddy!

20:14.370 --> 20:15.736
Come here.

20:23.546 --> 20:24.946
I love you, boys.

20:24.981 --> 20:26.547
These idiots...

20:26.583 --> 20:28.616
What in the...?

20:28.651 --> 20:30.151
Y'all finished?

20:30.186 --> 20:31.497
This how you gonna
find our daughter?

20:31.521 --> 20:36.023
Well, where the hell
have you been?

20:42.265 --> 20:43.998
Shit.

20:44.033 --> 20:47.101
The russians won't kill you
if they're shaking you down.

20:47.136 --> 20:51.839
They ain't try to kill me.

20:51.875 --> 20:54.542
<i>She</i> did.

20:54.577 --> 20:56.544
Right?

20:56.579 --> 20:59.146
Her and virginia...

20:59.182 --> 21:02.917
Tried to shoot me, drown me,
then set my body on fire.

21:02.952 --> 21:05.686
Ain't that right, baby?

21:17.066 --> 21:18.833
You try to kill my baby boy?

21:20.003 --> 21:22.336
Who hasn't, clay?

21:22.372 --> 21:24.071
You think that's funny? No.

21:24.107 --> 21:26.908
I don't think anything
about your son is funny.

21:26.943 --> 21:29.343
I think roller is a mad dog.

21:32.749 --> 21:34.916
And if I wouldn't
have tried to put him down,

21:34.951 --> 21:37.418
Somebody else would have.

21:37.453 --> 21:41.255
So do it, clay.

21:49.098 --> 21:54.135
You're lucky that putin's whore
wants to talk to you.

21:54.170 --> 21:57.138
I'd drop your ass right here.

21:57.173 --> 22:00.207
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
You knew about all this?

22:00.243 --> 22:02.009
Not the whole time.
Not the whole time.

22:02.045 --> 22:03.711
Well, when were
you gonna tell me?!

22:03.746 --> 22:06.047
When you came to your senses,
which never happened.

22:06.082 --> 22:08.149
I told you she was
a lying bitch.

22:08.184 --> 22:13.688
None of that matters!
We got to get that baby back.

22:13.723 --> 22:16.190
I'm gonna go.

22:16.225 --> 22:17.592
They can have me for brienne.

22:17.627 --> 22:18.993
That sounds good to me.

22:19.028 --> 22:21.429
It's not gonna stop
with your sorry ass, roller.

22:21.464 --> 22:25.032
It's not gonna stop until
every single one of us is dead.

22:25.068 --> 22:28.069
Clay, you know that.

22:28.104 --> 22:30.538
If riva want to talk to me...

22:30.573 --> 22:32.807
I'll go.

22:32.842 --> 22:34.642
I'll get your baby back.

22:43.386 --> 22:46.754
Stop it.

22:46.790 --> 22:48.323
Bitch is here.

22:48.358 --> 22:51.960
I have had white men
pulling guns on me all day,

22:51.995 --> 22:53.728
And my ass is tired.

22:53.763 --> 22:56.564
So, please, stop pushing me.

22:56.600 --> 22:58.833
Boris very much wants
to kill you.

22:58.869 --> 23:01.970
You got to know I had nothing
to do with roller's stupidity.

23:02.005 --> 23:03.404
You got to believe that, riva.

23:03.440 --> 23:05.540
I was the one that told you
he was coming.

23:05.575 --> 23:06.975
You like coffee?

23:07.010 --> 23:09.844
I need to know
that brienne is okay.

23:09.880 --> 23:13.181
Where is brienne, riva, please?

23:13.216 --> 23:15.416
Please.

23:25.228 --> 23:28.496
Most expensive coffee
in the world.

23:28.532 --> 23:32.800
They force strange cat to eat
beans, cat shits out coffee.

23:32.836 --> 23:35.970
Sometimes cat dies,
cannot be helped.

23:36.006 --> 23:39.140
It's price of doing business.

23:39.175 --> 23:43.645
Riva, I need to know
brienne is okay.

23:43.680 --> 23:46.614
Please.

23:50.387 --> 23:52.320
Brienne!

23:52.355 --> 23:53.521
You okay, baby?

23:53.557 --> 23:55.557
You good?
They treating you okay?

23:55.592 --> 23:59.160
Riva let me ride her horse.
We're getting a doll later.

23:59.195 --> 24:00.261
That's nice.

24:00.297 --> 24:02.697
You look like
a little princess up there.

24:02.732 --> 24:06.034
Be a good girl, baby, okay?
You're gonna go home real soon.

24:10.140 --> 24:12.774
Roller stopped honoring
our bargain,

24:12.809 --> 24:15.476
Then he killed
two of my soldiers.

24:15.512 --> 24:18.246
I ask for roller's head
in exchange for child.

24:18.281 --> 24:21.883
I see no head, I keep child.

24:21.918 --> 24:24.152
Uncle daddy's
never gonna give up roller...

24:24.187 --> 24:26.354
Eespecially after
you killed his wife.

24:26.389 --> 24:29.424
Like I say, price of business.

24:29.459 --> 24:31.426
Riva, I'm telling you right now,

24:31.461 --> 24:35.296
You don't want to start a war
with the dixie mafia.

24:35.332 --> 24:38.066
I'm not afraid
of inbred monkey boys.

24:38.101 --> 24:39.500
You damn well should be.

24:39.536 --> 24:42.170
Those boys are born
with a head full of stupid.

24:42.205 --> 24:43.738
And one foot in the grave.

24:43.773 --> 24:48.142
Dying for a cause
gets them hard... believe me.

24:48.178 --> 24:50.778
Price must be paid
for death of yuri.

24:50.814 --> 24:52.847
Uncle daddy agrees.

24:52.882 --> 24:58.686
And I can offer you $250,000.

24:58.722 --> 24:59.754
Cute.

24:59.789 --> 25:00.922
That is insult.

25:00.957 --> 25:02.457
Let me kill the child.

25:02.492 --> 25:05.526
No, wait! Stop him.
Riva don't let him...

25:05.562 --> 25:06.794
Get off of me!

25:06.830 --> 25:09.564
Riva, please!

25:09.599 --> 25:11.733
I know what that shit means
on your hands, riva!

25:11.768 --> 25:15.970
I can help you!

25:16.006 --> 25:19.841
So, have you heard
from arlene since we...

25:19.876 --> 25:21.776
Youknowwhatted her?

25:21.811 --> 25:28.383
Roofied her, it's called.

25:28.418 --> 25:32.553
You made the right choice.
I know it wasn't easy.

25:33.990 --> 25:38.493
Sorry, that's marnie.

25:39.796 --> 25:41.396
Hey, what's going on, girl?

25:41.431 --> 25:45.066
I'm sorry to bug, but my mom's
acting extra erratic today.

25:45.101 --> 25:46.979
She said we were moving tonight,
and I was like, "where?"

25:47.003 --> 25:48.469
And she's like,
"I don't know yet."

25:49.572 --> 25:51.506
Is there any way I could
hang out here today?

25:51.541 --> 25:53.608
Um... Not today.

25:53.643 --> 25:56.010
Um, we're not even
technically open,

25:56.046 --> 25:59.347
'cause we're packing up,
moving to the salon.

25:59.382 --> 26:02.083
Okay.
Um, I'll see you later then?

26:02.118 --> 26:04.318
Yeah, I'll check
on you tonight. Don't worry.

26:04.354 --> 26:06.487
Everybody knows
your mom is craycray.

26:08.491 --> 26:10.425
See you later.

26:30.213 --> 26:32.814
Where were you?

26:34.651 --> 26:36.751
I kept calling and...
And calling and calling.

26:36.786 --> 26:38.564
You know, we can all tell
that you're using again.

26:38.588 --> 26:40.555
Just stop...

26:40.590 --> 26:46.094
Avoiding the question.

26:46.129 --> 26:54.129
Why were the kids at juanda's?

26:55.705 --> 26:58.673
I was with somebody.

27:08.685 --> 27:10.184
Who?

27:10.220 --> 27:12.064
Well, it's not like that's
gonna make any difference.

27:12.088 --> 27:16.124
You tell me whose cock
was more important to you.

27:16.159 --> 27:17.458
Than keeping your child safe!

27:17.494 --> 27:20.628
Hank gluck!

27:20.663 --> 27:21.796
Who?

27:21.831 --> 27:27.568
At the messianic center.

27:27.604 --> 27:30.938
The... the jew for Jesus?

27:30.974 --> 27:33.975
Yeah.

27:40.784 --> 27:42.784
The guy who square dances?

27:42.819 --> 27:44.418
Yeah, that's him.

27:44.454 --> 27:51.259
That...

27:51.294 --> 27:53.060
You... you did it!

27:53.096 --> 27:54.829
Babe... You did it.

27:56.766 --> 27:59.267
Baby, I'm so sorry.

27:59.302 --> 28:00.835
I kept telling you that...

28:00.870 --> 28:03.304
I didn't want you
to live this life anymore,

28:03.339 --> 28:05.050
And you just kept getting
deeper and deeper in.

28:05.074 --> 28:07.975
And... and I just felt so alone.

28:08.011 --> 28:10.945
I'm so sorry, baby.
I'm so sorry.

28:10.980 --> 28:12.547
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

28:12.582 --> 28:13.748
I'm sorry.

28:13.783 --> 28:15.616
No.

28:15.652 --> 28:17.585
I pushed you...

28:17.620 --> 28:20.321
Into being a whore.

28:25.328 --> 28:29.430
Well, I'd rather be a whore
than a murderer.

28:34.037 --> 28:35.469
Bryce...

28:35.505 --> 28:39.640
Because you were trying to
protect your friend desna...

28:39.676 --> 28:41.475
I murdered the wrong people.

28:41.511 --> 28:44.946
I didn't know until
it was already done.

28:44.981 --> 28:46.814
Okay, you got to believe me.

28:46.850 --> 28:48.382
I'm so sorry.

28:48.418 --> 28:49.550
It'll never happen again.

28:49.586 --> 28:50.985
You're right. No, you're right.

28:51.020 --> 28:52.153
You are sorry.

28:52.188 --> 28:54.188
I'm sorry.

28:55.959 --> 28:58.092
Baby, I'm sorry!

28:58.127 --> 29:01.896
I love you!

29:01.931 --> 29:06.334
The eye means you see
everything... all the details.

29:06.369 --> 29:08.302
Nothing is lost on you.

29:08.338 --> 29:10.705
The spider means
you bow to no man.

29:10.740 --> 29:13.040
And the rings convey
your high rank.

29:13.076 --> 29:15.509
She has google, everybody.

29:16.746 --> 29:21.148
Riva, I know that $250,000
is not enough...

29:21.184 --> 29:23.017
For a boss of your stature.

29:23.052 --> 29:24.285
Ding, ding, ding.

29:24.320 --> 29:25.753
I'm listening.

29:25.788 --> 29:28.723
How about a percentage
of all of his businesses?

29:28.758 --> 29:32.159
The clinic, she she's,
the vending machines, all of it.

29:32.195 --> 29:33.594
How big?

29:33.630 --> 29:34.762
25%.

29:34.797 --> 29:37.365
You're not authorized
to make this offer.

29:37.400 --> 29:39.333
Let me worry about that.

29:39.369 --> 29:41.335
75%.

29:41.371 --> 29:42.536
50%.

29:42.572 --> 29:44.405
And I'll throw in the salon.

29:44.440 --> 29:47.875
To keep all the money
squeaky clean for you.

29:47.911 --> 29:49.610
The clinic is interesting.

29:49.646 --> 29:52.546
The mall is complete shit,
of course, but the location.

29:52.582 --> 29:55.750
Is unparalleled,
according to analytics.

29:55.785 --> 29:58.119
Use the operation as a model.

29:58.154 --> 30:00.821
That is a good deal,
and you know it.

30:00.857 --> 30:05.993
You can replicate that all over
the state... everywhere.

30:06.029 --> 30:08.029
He will never go for it.

30:08.064 --> 30:10.031
He might not have a choice.

30:10.066 --> 30:11.346
You let me worry
about that side.

30:24.805 --> 30:25.882
You wouldn't believe my day.

30:25.906 --> 30:27.372
Yeah, me, neither.

30:31.845 --> 30:33.879
Okay, okay. Bryce...

30:33.914 --> 30:34.991
Shut up. Shut up,
shut up, shut up.

30:35.015 --> 30:36.114
Shut up, shut up, shut up.

30:36.149 --> 30:37.415
You all right?

30:37.451 --> 30:39.551
Yeah. You want me
to take this zipper off?

30:39.586 --> 30:41.152
What are you doing?
What's happening?

30:47.327 --> 30:50.495
I want you to take a look.

30:53.500 --> 30:55.567
Stop. All right, right here?

30:55.602 --> 30:58.737
No, no, no, no, no.
I'll be right back.

31:00.874 --> 31:02.307
What's going on, marnie?

31:02.342 --> 31:04.376
Polly, what are you doing here?

31:04.411 --> 31:05.588
Look, look... wait.
No, you don't.

31:05.612 --> 31:06.912
I've got money.

31:06.947 --> 31:09.147
Bullshit.
Okay, and you have to make...

31:09.182 --> 31:10.715
No, I got money.

31:10.751 --> 31:11.917
Girl, I got money, I got you.

31:11.952 --> 31:13.229
I got you. Stay right here.
I'll get it.

31:13.253 --> 31:14.464
I think you're bullshitting me.

31:14.488 --> 31:15.954
I'm not. I'll be right back.

31:15.989 --> 31:17.389
Do you have any cash on you?

31:17.424 --> 31:19.057
Why, what's going on?
Just... we...

31:19.092 --> 31:24.229
Whatever you have, okay?

31:24.264 --> 31:27.065
You got it? I got 80 bucks.

31:27.100 --> 31:30.869
Great. Give it to me. Okay.

31:30.904 --> 31:32.804
Just... I be right back, okay?

31:34.574 --> 31:37.442
What is going on?

31:37.477 --> 31:41.780
Here's $300 or $400. Well, $380.

31:41.815 --> 31:46.251
These are gucci purses.

31:46.286 --> 31:47.619
Go, git!

31:47.654 --> 31:48.987
Get out.

31:49.022 --> 31:53.458
Go.

31:53.493 --> 31:54.726
Okay.

32:04.571 --> 32:05.904
What's... what's going...

32:05.939 --> 32:07.684
Listen to me. Listen, listen,
listen, listen, listen.

32:07.708 --> 32:09.741
Listen to me, marnie.
Listen, listen.

32:09.776 --> 32:11.276
You're okay.

32:11.311 --> 32:13.011
You're okay.
This thing that happened.

32:13.046 --> 32:14.913
Is the best thing
that ever happened to you.

32:14.948 --> 32:17.315
She said she couldn't afford
to take me to myrtle beach.

32:17.351 --> 32:20.618
My mom just tried
to sell me to a stranger.

32:20.654 --> 32:22.120
Yeah, I know, I know,
I know, sugar.

32:22.155 --> 32:23.788
But I've got you.

32:25.826 --> 32:27.759
Shh!

32:27.794 --> 32:29.995
Listen...

32:30.030 --> 32:33.431
This pain you're feeling
is just the meagerness.

32:33.467 --> 32:35.200
And disappointment
of your former life.

32:35.235 --> 32:37.402
Leaving your body forever.

32:37.437 --> 32:38.870
Okay?

32:41.241 --> 32:44.175
Good riddance for
bad rubbish, I say.

32:44.211 --> 32:47.278
We're gonna have
so much fun together.

32:47.314 --> 32:50.515
I have so much to teach you.

33:04.931 --> 33:06.431
Yeah.

33:06.466 --> 33:09.968
Hey, clay, how you holding up?
Good lord, boys.

33:10.003 --> 33:12.070
Good to see ya.

33:12.105 --> 33:14.806
I tell you, the scope
and breadth of your loyalty.

33:14.841 --> 33:15.940
Encourages me.

33:15.976 --> 33:17.275
Sorry to hear about juanda.

33:17.310 --> 33:19.477
Hurricane of a woman. Truly was.

33:19.513 --> 33:21.713
Clay, I got to motor
on to macon.

33:21.748 --> 33:24.682
It seems ted from georgia
has gone missing.

33:24.718 --> 33:27.685
You don't say. Well,
I wish... wish we could help.

33:27.721 --> 33:29.387
You got bigger fish to fry.

33:29.423 --> 33:31.489
Circus here has got you
for anything you need.

33:31.525 --> 33:33.124
I'll check in with you <i> manana.</i>

33:33.160 --> 33:35.000
All right, well, let me
know what you find out.

33:38.432 --> 33:39.964
Hey.

33:40.000 --> 33:41.166
Hey, how's brienne?

33:41.201 --> 33:42.434
She's good, baby.

33:42.469 --> 33:43.868
She's okay? She's good.

33:43.904 --> 33:45.270
She's good. What's she want?

33:45.305 --> 33:47.272
My head on a plate,
that's what she wants.

33:47.307 --> 33:50.608
Riva is in a lot of pain
over the loss of yuri.

33:50.644 --> 33:53.078
And the only thing that's gonna
wash that for her.

33:53.113 --> 33:56.181
Is 50% of your businesses.

33:56.216 --> 33:57.248
Or his head.

33:57.284 --> 33:58.883
You decide. Hell no!

33:58.919 --> 34:01.453
Uncle daddy, this is business...
I don't give a damn what she...

34:01.488 --> 34:03.521
Hey! Get your hands off me!

34:03.557 --> 34:05.690
I wish it was you! You did this!

34:05.725 --> 34:09.393
I don't give a shit!
I can't care...

34:09.429 --> 34:12.330
Enough! Enough!

34:12.364 --> 34:14.599
Okay. You're okay, you're okay.

34:14.634 --> 34:17.569
Y'all listen up.
This here thing has snowballed.

34:17.603 --> 34:21.072
Rolling down the hill,
getting bigger and bigger.

34:21.108 --> 34:24.208
Soon, it'll be an avalanche
that's gonna bury all of us.

34:24.244 --> 34:27.911
Now, juanda,
she was my sissybird.

34:27.947 --> 34:30.715
She was my sun and moon.

34:30.750 --> 34:33.918
But she's gone.

34:33.954 --> 34:39.424
You boys are the nearest
thing to my heart now.

34:39.458 --> 34:41.493
I wish I could
make this go away.

34:41.527 --> 34:45.797
Goddamn, I wish I could
make it go away.

34:45.831 --> 34:49.734
But I can't.

34:49.768 --> 34:51.902
Brienne is my grandchild.

34:51.938 --> 34:56.174
The last thing I need is a
little girl's body on my hands.

35:00.080 --> 35:03.381
You tell riva that she can have
whatever she wants.

35:03.416 --> 35:08.052
But I want a sitdown...
Immediately.

35:58.672 --> 36:00.538
She'll be visiting
a little later.

36:11.484 --> 36:15.220
Baby! Brienne! Baby!

36:15.255 --> 36:16.421
Baby!

36:16.456 --> 36:18.456
Hey, hey! Mommy!

36:18.491 --> 36:20.124
You're okay, baby.

36:20.160 --> 36:21.259
What the hell is going on?

36:21.294 --> 36:23.161
Mommy's here. Roller...

36:23.196 --> 36:25.463
For the girl. Wait, what?

36:25.498 --> 36:28.366
Riva, this is not what
we discussed, and you know it.

36:28.401 --> 36:30.835
I change mind about
several bullet points.

36:30.870 --> 36:32.704
You bitch. You let... jenn, jenn!

36:32.739 --> 36:38.443
Stay right there, baby boy.

36:38.478 --> 36:41.512
Uncle daddy...

36:41.548 --> 36:44.415
Let me do the right thing here.

36:44.451 --> 36:46.584
Okay, you got him.
Come on, baby.

36:46.620 --> 36:47.919
Go to mommy. Mommy!

36:47.954 --> 36:51.522
Yes, baby! Yes, my baby!
I'm so happy to see you.

36:51.558 --> 36:55.526
Okay. Let's go.
Thank you, thank you.

36:55.562 --> 36:57.128
Riva, what the hell?

36:57.163 --> 36:59.330
Have a seat.

37:07.507 --> 37:10.808
50% of your businesses
will never be enough.

37:10.844 --> 37:14.445
I will have 100%
of all your businesses...

37:14.481 --> 37:18.149
Or roller dies
right here, right now.

37:18.184 --> 37:21.219
Riva.

37:21.254 --> 37:22.620
You son of a...

37:22.656 --> 37:26.257
Clay!

37:26.293 --> 37:28.126
Do we have a deal?

37:28.161 --> 37:31.162
Do I have a choice?

37:35.702 --> 37:40.505
It's not every day a man
signs away his life's work.

37:40.540 --> 37:42.206
And that's not even
the hard part.

37:42.242 --> 37:46.678
I just want to get home
and properly grief my wife.

37:46.713 --> 37:48.446
I imagine there is
lots for me to sign.

37:48.481 --> 37:51.349
Room for one more?

37:51.384 --> 37:53.718
Actually, there ain't.

37:53.753 --> 37:56.154
'Cause I ain't giving you shit.

37:56.189 --> 37:58.156
Ain't that right, circus?

38:09.395 --> 38:13.063
What are you waiting for?
Take the bitch out.

38:14.800 --> 38:16.299
What?

38:16.335 --> 38:20.036
You filthy, greasy, no good...

38:20.072 --> 38:23.940
That icecold slavic goodness
got to me first, man.

38:23.976 --> 38:27.444
In the end of the day,
I'm just a businessman, clay.

38:27.479 --> 38:30.147
Son of a syphilitic scumbag.

38:30.182 --> 38:31.715
Don't listen to him.

38:31.750 --> 38:34.785
He's just jealous.

38:34.820 --> 38:37.621
Everything is crashing down
around you, clay.

38:37.656 --> 38:40.524
Can we just please
get this over with?

38:40.559 --> 38:42.058
I agree.

38:42.094 --> 38:45.128
I'm gonna hit the buffet.

38:45.164 --> 38:49.099
Pardon me. Is...
Is the buffet in here?

38:49.134 --> 38:55.639
Thank you kindly.

39:03.348 --> 39:05.415
Finding everything in order?

39:05.451 --> 39:08.118
How does it feel, clay,
to lose everything?

39:08.153 --> 39:10.320
Well, I made it all myself.

39:10.355 --> 39:12.289
Nobody gave me shit.

39:12.324 --> 39:13.557
I'll make it again.

39:13.592 --> 39:14.858
Men...

39:14.893 --> 39:21.765
Are used to getting
so many chances.

39:21.800 --> 39:23.133
Aw.

39:23.168 --> 39:24.734
Missed you guys.

39:24.770 --> 39:27.571
There's my baby boy.

39:27.606 --> 39:29.406
Move it.

39:29.441 --> 39:32.509
Like I said, I ain't
giving you shit.

39:42.387 --> 39:45.155
What kind of sick shit is this?

39:45.190 --> 39:46.857
What the hell?

39:56.902 --> 40:01.338
All of you dickdragging
dungshovelers work for me now.

40:03.709 --> 40:05.108
What the hell?

40:05.143 --> 40:07.410
Move it, move it, move it.

40:07.446 --> 40:09.446
Now we can talk.

40:24.363 --> 40:25.996
There's the b... there's the bus.

40:27.065 --> 40:30.066
Dean! Dean? Come on.

40:30.102 --> 40:31.801
Look at me.

40:31.837 --> 40:33.336
You'll be fine, okay?

40:36.275 --> 40:39.609
I'm gonna give y'all some space.

40:39.645 --> 40:40.645
Hey, dean.

40:43.415 --> 40:45.515
Tomorrow's the big day.

40:45.551 --> 40:47.918
Yeah. Dean, you were right.

40:47.953 --> 40:50.353
I have made
some poor life choices.

40:50.389 --> 40:52.756
Yeah. You seem
particularly detached.

40:52.791 --> 40:55.025
The notion of consequences
for your actions.

40:55.060 --> 40:57.861
And I could stand
to work on that, yes.

40:57.896 --> 40:59.129
Yeah, you should... soon.

40:59.164 --> 41:00.297
I'm trying.

41:00.332 --> 41:02.065
Yeah. Keep trying.

41:02.100 --> 41:04.401
I will, baby.

41:29.995 --> 41:33.129
Hey, hey!

41:33.165 --> 41:34.331
Hey.

41:34.366 --> 41:36.433
We are so happy brienne is okay.

41:36.468 --> 41:37.867
I know. Yeah.

41:37.903 --> 41:39.269
How's jenn?

41:39.304 --> 41:40.537
Ask her yourself?

41:40.572 --> 41:43.173
Hey, hey, hey! Hey!

41:43.208 --> 41:44.741
Hi, y'all. Hey.

41:44.776 --> 41:47.010
How's that daughter?
God, she's fine.

41:47.045 --> 41:49.946
She wants to stay with riva.
Riva's got ponies.

41:49.982 --> 41:51.392
She bought her one of them
black baby dolls.

41:51.416 --> 41:52.649
From american girl place.

41:52.684 --> 41:54.651
Those cost
over a hundred dollars.

41:54.686 --> 41:56.386
I know.
Aprons on the counter, y'all.

41:56.421 --> 41:59.522
Okay. Cool.

41:59.558 --> 42:02.125
I just want to say that...

42:02.160 --> 42:04.494
You were absolutely right.

42:04.529 --> 42:06.696
This is all my doing.

42:06.732 --> 42:10.266
And um...

42:10.302 --> 42:12.902
I'm sorry.

42:12.938 --> 42:14.304
I know.

42:14.339 --> 42:18.141
Come on, y'all! Cheer up.
At least one good thing happened.

42:18.176 --> 42:19.943
This year... we're here.

42:19.978 --> 42:22.112
Okay, but the real
question is this...

42:22.147 --> 42:24.080
Is this place jeujed enough?

42:24.116 --> 42:25.615
And I'm talking our jeuj?

42:25.651 --> 42:27.884
I think <i> we're</i> the jeuj, y'all.

42:27.919 --> 42:30.987
Wherever we go, a jeuj follows.

42:32.624 --> 42:34.491
Desna, what's wrong?

42:34.526 --> 42:36.559
Tomorrow we get to
wake up fresh.

42:36.595 --> 42:39.496
Free from the dixie mafia
at last!

42:39.531 --> 42:41.097
Praise him!

42:41.133 --> 42:44.167
There's something
I haven't told you guys.

42:44.202 --> 42:47.604
Lord, no. What?

42:47.639 --> 42:50.440
One of the conditions of
riva accepting the deal.

42:50.475 --> 42:52.542
Was that I would go back
to the old salon.

42:52.577 --> 42:54.911
And continue to launder money...

42:54.946 --> 42:56.212
For the clinic.

42:56.248 --> 42:58.114
What?! What?!

42:58.150 --> 43:00.884
Jenn, it was the only way
to get brienne back.

43:00.919 --> 43:02.886
Well, why can't
we wash the money here?

43:02.921 --> 43:04.988
Yeah?
Because they don't use cash.

43:05.023 --> 43:06.256
On this side of town.

43:06.291 --> 43:08.758
It's harder to hide the shit.

43:08.794 --> 43:11.594
Listen...

43:11.630 --> 43:14.030
I want to give you this shop.

43:14.066 --> 43:15.832
Okay?

43:15.867 --> 43:18.501
Thank you for
putting up with me.

43:18.537 --> 43:20.036
And...

43:20.072 --> 43:22.205
I'm sorry about everything.

43:22.240 --> 43:23.773
You deserve it.

43:23.809 --> 43:27.177
And, um...

43:27.212 --> 43:30.680
I wish you all the success.

43:30.716 --> 43:33.049
Wow.

43:38.690 --> 43:43.993
I do not accept that.
I do not acknowledge that.

43:44.029 --> 43:45.361
Passaroni.

43:45.397 --> 43:48.398
Not for me. This place is shit.

43:48.433 --> 43:49.899
There ain't no personality here.

43:49.935 --> 43:52.135
Unh.

43:52.170 --> 43:54.037
We go...

43:54.072 --> 43:55.105
Where you go.

43:55.140 --> 43:56.606
Y'all come...

43:56.641 --> 43:58.219
You thought you was
gonna break the crew up?

43:58.243 --> 44:00.543
Yeah, not this crew! No way!

44:00.579 --> 44:02.345
I mean, we have got
all the skills.

44:02.380 --> 44:03.947
We got human trafficking?

44:03.982 --> 44:06.182
What?

44:06.218 --> 44:08.451
Right. Um...

44:08.487 --> 44:12.188
I bought that little marnie
off her hooker mama yesterday...

44:12.224 --> 44:17.393
For $800 and four
vintage gucci handbags.

44:17.429 --> 44:19.028
You know, with
the bamboo handles.

44:19.064 --> 44:20.096
Okay, pol...

44:20.132 --> 44:22.031
I can't with your
stories right now.

44:22.067 --> 44:23.199
Now just stop it.

44:23.235 --> 44:26.002
Okay. What else do we
have going for us?

44:26.037 --> 44:28.505
Yeah, right. Identity theft.

44:28.540 --> 44:29.672
Adultery. Yeah.

44:29.708 --> 44:30.940
Aggravated assault.

44:30.976 --> 44:32.809
Murder. Attempted murder.

44:32.844 --> 44:35.178
It's the thought that counts.
Yeah!

44:36.448 --> 44:38.581
Y'all, we are some crew.

44:38.617 --> 44:40.083
<i>The</i> crew.

44:40.118 --> 44:43.253
Y'all are the baddest
bitches in palmetto.

44:43.288 --> 44:44.621
Yeah. For real.

45:43.949 --> 45:46.416
These are desperate times.

45:46.451 --> 45:50.320
That russian bitch finna
upset the whole apple cart.

45:50.355 --> 45:52.488
Y'all need to help us.

45:52.524 --> 45:55.525
It's gonna affect
your business, too.
