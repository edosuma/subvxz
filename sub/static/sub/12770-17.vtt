00:07.250 --> 00:08.500
I HAD THIS FRIEND
IN COLLEGE--MIA.

00:08.542 --> 00:09.750
AND THE FIRST TIME I MET HER,

00:09.792 --> 00:10.709
I REMEMBER SHE WAS TELLING ME
ABOUT THIS GUY--

00:10.750 --> 00:12.041
ROBERT SOMETHING.

00:12.083 --> 00:14.166
AND SHE DESCRIBED HIM
AS "MORE OLD-MAN GOOD-LOOKING

00:14.208 --> 00:15.792
THAN COLLEGE GOOD-LOOKING."

00:15.834 --> 00:17.750
AND SHE SAID
HOW IT WOULD BE A WASTE

00:17.792 --> 00:19.959
TO DATE SOMEBODY LIKE THAT
WHILE STILL IN COLLEGE.

00:20.000 --> 00:22.208
BUT HE WAS CRAZY ABOUT HER
AND HE KEPT ASKING HER OUT,

00:22.250 --> 00:24.208
AND SHE KEPT SAYING NO--
AGAIN AND AGAIN.

00:24.250 --> 00:26.041
AND THEN...

00:26.083 --> 00:28.041
JUNIOR YEAR, DURING FINALS,
I WAS IN THE LIBRARY,

00:28.083 --> 00:30.792
AND I SAW THEM TOGETHER
IN THE STACKS MAKING OUT.

00:30.834 --> 00:33.125
I MEAN, LIKE,
SERIOUSLY MAKING OUT.

00:33.166 --> 00:36.041
AND I KEPT THINKING,
HOW DID THAT HAPPEN?

00:36.083 --> 00:39.166
♪♪♪

00:40.667 --> 00:43.959
SORRY, DAD.
JUST ONE MORE MINUTE.

00:44.000 --> 00:46.625
IT'S YOUR BIRTHDAY, ANGE.
TAKE FIVE MORE MINUTES.

00:46.667 --> 00:49.458
(chuckles)

00:49.500 --> 00:50.542
SO THERE'S...

00:50.583 --> 00:52.000
SOMETHING
I WANTED TO TELL YOU.

00:52.041 --> 00:53.417
LET ME GUESS.

00:53.458 --> 00:56.000
YOU'RE DROPPING BIO AND ALL
OF YOUR PRE-MED CLASSES?

00:56.041 --> 00:58.875
I WAS PLANNING ON SNEAKING
THAT IN AFTER DINNER.

00:58.917 --> 01:00.041
OUCH.

01:00.083 --> 01:02.041
(laughs) JUST KIDDING.
I LIKE BEING PRE MED.

01:02.083 --> 01:03.166
KIND OF.

01:03.208 --> 01:05.166
ANYWAY...

01:05.208 --> 01:08.625
THE THING IS...
I DID IT.

01:08.667 --> 01:10.500
I HAD SEX
FOR THE FIRST TIME.

01:10.542 --> 01:11.834
WHAT?
I--

01:11.875 --> 01:13.375
NO, WAIT. DON'T--DON'T--
DON'T SAY THAT AGAIN.

01:13.417 --> 01:14.834
I MEAN, I MIGHT BE IN LOVE

01:14.875 --> 01:16.834
SO WE HAD SEX,
AND IT WAS--

01:16.875 --> 01:18.834
OH, NO. NO, I--
I DON'T--

01:18.875 --> 01:21.041
I DON'T REALLY WANT TO KNOW
WHAT IT WAS LIKE.

01:21.083 --> 01:22.500
I DON'T WANT TO KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

01:22.542 --> 01:23.709
YOU'RE STILL 8
AND YOU'RE PUTTING ON

01:23.750 --> 01:25.041
YOUR MOTHER'S MAKEUP
FOR THE FIRST TIME.

01:25.083 --> 01:26.709
I'M NOT 8,
AND HE'S REALLY NICE.

01:26.750 --> 01:28.417
AND HIS NAME IS--

01:28.458 --> 01:29.709
I MEAN, YOU REALIZE,
YOU TELL ME HIS NAME,

01:29.750 --> 01:31.041
I'M GONNA HAVE TO
HUNT HIM DOWN--
DAD.

01:31.083 --> 01:32.500
I'M SORRY.

01:32.542 --> 01:33.875
(laughs) I'M SORRY.

01:33.917 --> 01:35.250
WOW.

01:35.291 --> 01:37.125
I MEAN, THIS IS A...

01:37.166 --> 01:38.667
THIS IS
A LITTLE WEIRD FOR ME.

01:38.709 --> 01:39.750
YOU'RE...

01:39.792 --> 01:41.709
YOU'RE MY BABY GIRL.

01:41.750 --> 01:43.709
I KNOW, BUT...

01:43.750 --> 01:45.709
(sighs) I KIND OF

01:45.750 --> 01:47.959
I DON'T KNOW,
I WANTED TO TELL YOU

01:48.000 --> 01:51.041
BECAUSE I'M SO HAPPY.

01:51.083 --> 01:53.291
AND I FIGURED THAT IS
SOMETHING YOU'D WANT TO HEAR.

01:53.333 --> 01:55.625
WELL, I DO, BUT I...

01:55.667 --> 01:59.709
I DO, AND I'M--
I'M GLAD YOU TOLD ME.

01:59.750 --> 02:01.667

02:01.709 --> 02:04.000
IT'S NICE,

02:13.959 --> 02:16.208
LET'S GO EAT.
COME ON.

02:24.959 --> 02:26.041
HEY.

02:26.083 --> 02:28.166
HOW LONG
HAVE I BEEN SLEEPING?

02:28.208 --> 02:29.667
SINCE LAST NIGHT.

02:29.709 --> 02:31.750
HOW DO YOU FEEL?

02:31.792 --> 02:33.959
GROGGY.

02:34.000 --> 02:35.333
OKAY, I GUESS.

02:35.375 --> 02:37.834
I'LL BE RIGHT OUTSIDE
IF EITHER OF YOU NEEDS ME,

02:37.875 --> 02:39.417
OKAY?

02:49.125 --> 02:50.709
OH, GOD. SAM...

02:52.208 --> 02:53.709
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
I'M FINE. I'M FINE.

02:53.750 --> 02:55.583
NO, NO, NO,
I-I BROKE YOUR DOOR.

02:55.625 --> 02:57.041
WELL, I WAS WORRIED
ABOUT YOU,

02:57.083 --> 02:59.041
AND THE DOOR,
IT WASN'T YOUR FAULT.

02:59.083 --> 03:01.625
NO, EVEN IF
I DON'T MEAN TO DO...
SHH.

03:01.667 --> 03:04.125
THE STUFF I DO, I STILL--
IT STILL HAPPENS.
STOP IT. S--CORINNE.

03:04.166 --> 03:06.208
STOP. STOP. STOP IT.
I STILL DO IT.

03:06.250 --> 03:07.875
STOP.

03:07.917 --> 03:09.792
WE ARE IN THIS TOGETHER.

03:09.834 --> 03:11.250
OKAY?

03:11.291 --> 03:13.041
NOW AS LONG
AS YOU KEEP TRYING--

03:13.083 --> 03:14.834
NO, I WILL. I PROMISE.
BUT JUST--

03:14.875 --> 03:15.750
I KNOW. I KNOW.

03:15.792 --> 03:18.667
I PROMISE.

03:20.875 --> 03:23.250
PLEASE.

03:23.291 --> 03:24.959
DON'T GIVE UP ON ME.

03:25.000 --> 03:26.792
YOU KNOW,
BECAUSE WITHOUT YOU--

03:26.834 --> 03:30.041
HEY, I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

03:30.083 --> 03:32.542
OKAY. OKAY.

03:32.583 --> 03:34.542
OKAY, LOOK, I THINK SHE NEEDS
A PROPER FACILITY.

03:34.583 --> 03:35.792
ALL RIGHT.
WELL, I'M A DOCTOR.

03:35.834 --> 03:36.750
ALL RIGHT?
I CAN HANDLE ALL THAT.

03:36.792 --> 03:38.750
IT'S NOT A ONE-MAN JOB.
OKAY?

03:38.792 --> 03:41.250
SHE'S GONNA REQUIRE STRICT
SUPERVISION AROUND THE CLOCK,

03:41.291 --> 03:43.625
DAILY THERAPY,
CONSTANT MONITORING TILL WE FIND

03:43.667 --> 03:44.875
A DRUG COCKTAIL
TO KEEP HER STABILIZED.

03:44.917 --> 03:45.875
SHELDON,
I CAN DO ALL OF THAT.

03:45.917 --> 03:47.417
SAM, IT CAN BE
A HUGE CHALLENGE

03:47.458 --> 03:48.875
TO GET SOMEONE
IN CORINNE'S CONDITION

03:48.917 --> 03:50.250
JUST TO TAKE HER MEDS.

03:50.291 --> 03:53.041
YOU CAN'T GIVE UP
YOUR ENTIRE LIFE TO DO THIS,

03:53.083 --> 03:55.000
EVEN IF YOU TRIED--

03:55.041 --> 03:56.041
SHE'S MY SISTER!

03:56.083 --> 03:57.417
THEN BE HER BROTHER,

03:57.458 --> 03:59.792
NOT HER WARDEN.

03:59.834 --> 04:02.250
YOU GOTTA TRUST ME ON THIS.

04:04.542 --> 04:06.709
DR. WILDER, WE NEED YOU.

04:06.750 --> 04:08.041
IS THAT SCOTT?
WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED?

04:08.083 --> 04:09.417
IT WAS A DOMESTIC.

04:09.458 --> 04:10.875
HUSBAND WENT CRAZY
ON HIS WIFE.

04:10.917 --> 04:12.166
WE THOUGHT HE WAS GONE.

04:12.208 --> 04:13.917
TRAUMA PANEL. C-SPINE,
CHEST AND PELVIS.

04:13.959 --> 04:15.750
HE CAME BACK WITH SOME FRIENDS.
THEY JUMPED US.

04:15.792 --> 04:17.667
SCOTT GOT THE WORST OF IT.
OKAY, ON MY COUNT.

04:17.709 --> 04:19.417
HONESTLY, I'M FINE.
ONE, TWO, THREE.

04:19.458 --> 04:22.500
OH! SON OF A BITCH! OHH!

04:22.542 --> 04:23.750
OKAY, HIS SHOULDER
IS DISLOCATED.

04:23.792 --> 04:25.125
5 OF MORPHINE, I.V. PUSH.
(groans)

04:25.166 --> 04:27.041
HE TOOK A FEW BLOWS
TO THE RIBS

04:27.083 --> 04:28.041
AND GOT KICKED IN THE HEAD.

04:28.083 --> 04:29.959
CALL NEURO.
WE NEED A BRAIN C.T.

04:30.000 --> 04:30.917
VIOLET.

04:30.959 --> 04:33.750
HE'S BEEN ASKING FOR HER.
SHOULD I...

04:33.792 --> 04:35.834
SHOULD SOMEONE CALL
DR. TURNER?

04:35.875 --> 04:45.875
I'LL DO IT.

04:45.917 --> 04:51.083
I'LL DO IT.

04:51.125 --> 04:52.875
HEY.

04:52.917 --> 04:54.083
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE
SO LATE?

04:54.125 --> 04:55.792
CATCHING UP
ON PATIENT FILES.

04:55.834 --> 04:57.792
YOU?

04:57.834 --> 05:00.166
I CHECKED ON CORINNE.

05:03.625 --> 05:05.000
(clicks tongue)

05:05.041 --> 05:08.250
(blows air rhythmically)

05:08.291 --> 05:10.125
YOU'RE HOVERING.
IT'S WEIRDING ME OUT.

05:10.166 --> 05:11.792
(chuckles)

05:13.959 --> 05:15.375
SO ANY... (sighs)

05:15.417 --> 05:18.000
ANY DECISION?

05:20.417 --> 05:21.917
I THINK I WANT

05:21.959 --> 05:23.750
MINT TEA
INSTEAD OF CHAMOMILE.

05:23.792 --> 05:26.125
(chuckles) YEAH, I MEANT,
YOU KNOW, THE BABY.

05:26.166 --> 05:27.917
WHAT BABY?

05:27.959 --> 05:29.125
I KNOW THIS IS HARD,

05:29.166 --> 05:31.166
BUT YOU'RE WELL INTO
YOUR SECOND TRIMESTER.

05:31.208 --> 05:32.917
TIME IS RUNNING OUT

05:32.959 --> 05:34.959
IF YOU DECIDE YOU WANT TO...

05:35.000 --> 05:36.834
I MEAN, YOU KNOW, IF--
IF YOU NEED TO...

05:36.875 --> 05:38.792
TERMINATE.

05:40.083 --> 05:41.625
YOU COULD KEEP THE BABY.

05:41.667 --> 05:43.041
I'M TWO SECONDS SOBER.

05:43.083 --> 05:45.125
I'M NOT EXACTLY MOTHER
OF THE YEAR MATERIAL.

05:45.166 --> 05:47.041
WHAT ABOUT ADOPTION?

05:47.083 --> 05:49.041
BECAUSE CRACK BABIES
ARE IN SUCH HIGH DEMAND.

05:49.083 --> 05:51.041
(sighs)

05:51.083 --> 05:53.959
I'M SORRY NONE OF THE CHOICES
ARE WITHOUT PAIN.

05:57.417 --> 05:59.041
IT'S TIME.

05:59.083 --> 06:02.583
YOU KNOW, YOU...
YOU NEED TO CHOOSE.

06:10.083 --> 06:11.000
(laughs)

06:11.041 --> 06:12.041
OH, MY.

06:12.083 --> 06:13.250
SPINNING, SPINNING,
SPINNING.

06:13.291 --> 06:14.542
OH, RIGHT HAND YELLOW.

06:14.583 --> 06:15.792
OH.
OH, OKAY.

06:15.834 --> 06:17.000
OH, GREAT. GOOD THING
I DO YOGA.

06:17.041 --> 06:19.041
NO, MY BODY
DOES NOT MOVE THAT WAY.

06:19.083 --> 06:20.375
(laughs)
MOM, YOU SHOULD COME PLAY.

06:20.417 --> 06:22.959
OH, BUT YOUR MOM
IS THE BEST SPINNER.

06:23.000 --> 06:24.041
THAT'S RIGHT.
I AM THE BEST.

06:24.083 --> 06:26.000
COME ON, COOP.
RIGHT HAND YELLOW.

06:26.041 --> 06:27.041
(laughs)

06:27.083 --> 06:29.041
HEY!
THAT WAS JUST SAD.

06:29.083 --> 06:30.375
COULD WE PLAY Wii
OR SOMETHING NOW?

06:30.417 --> 06:32.291
(imitates Cooper) CAN WE PLAY
Wii OR SOMETHING...

06:32.333 --> 06:34.375
OKAY. I WILL REIGN SUPREME.

06:34.417 --> 06:36.041
SPIN IT.

06:36.083 --> 06:37.625
SPINNING.

06:37.667 --> 06:38.875
(clicks)

06:42.542 --> 06:44.417
WHAT HAPPENED?

06:44.458 --> 06:45.917
HE GOT HIMSELF BETWEEN
A BATTERED WIFE

06:45.959 --> 06:47.041
AND A DRUNK HUSBAND.

06:47.083 --> 06:49.041
HUSBAND CAME OUT
ON TOP, THOUGH, SO...

06:49.083 --> 06:50.041
DON'T SAY THAT.
THIS ISN'T FUNNY.

06:50.083 --> 06:52.041
OW!
THAT'S MY SHOULDER.

06:52.083 --> 06:54.667
IT'S DISLOCATED.
CAN YOU DO SOMETHING?

06:54.709 --> 06:56.041
I'M GONNA TRY TO REDUCE IT
BEFORE THE MORPHINE WEARS OFF.

06:56.083 --> 06:57.250
YOU MIGHT WANT
TO WAIT OUTSIDE.

06:57.291 --> 06:58.500
WHY?

06:58.542 --> 07:00.041
IT'S NOT GONNA BE
VERY PRETTY.

07:00.083 --> 07:01.333
I'VE SEEN WORSE THINGS

07:01.375 --> 07:02.125
THAN A SHOULDER BEING SLID
BACK INTO ITS SOCKET.

07:02.166 --> 07:03.333
LET--LET ME HELP.

07:05.083 --> 07:06.041
MM.

07:06.083 --> 07:07.041
(sighs) OKAY.

07:07.083 --> 07:08.208
I'M GONNA DO
THE KOCHER MANEUVER.

07:08.250 --> 07:09.500
DO YOU REMEMBER
HOW TO DO IT?

07:09.542 --> 07:11.291
OF COURSE.

07:11.333 --> 07:13.750
OKAY.

07:13.792 --> 07:15.667
COME RIGHT IN HERE.

07:15.709 --> 07:17.041
PUT YOUR HANDS
ON HIS SHOULDER.

07:17.083 --> 07:18.083
OW.

07:18.125 --> 07:19.208
WHEN I SAY,

07:19.250 --> 07:22.041
YOU PUSH DOWN HARD.

07:22.083 --> 07:24.500
(groans and clears throat)

07:24.542 --> 07:26.291
AH.
READY?

07:26.333 --> 07:28.041
AH. AH.
OKAY, NOW.

07:28.083 --> 07:30.041
AAH! (coughs) AAH!
IT'S NOT WORKING.

07:30.083 --> 07:32.041
PUSH HARDER.
PETE, I CAN'T.
IT'S NOT WORKING.

07:32.083 --> 07:33.542
YOU'RE NOT
PRESSING HARD ENOUGH.

07:33.583 --> 07:35.458
I NEED SOME HELP HERE.
VIOLET, WE ARE ALMOST THERE.

07:35.500 --> 07:37.041
WE CAN'T STOP NOW.
HEY, VIOLET.

07:37.083 --> 07:39.083
HEY, HEY, LOOK AT ME.
LOOK AT ME, YOU CAN DO THIS.

07:39.125 --> 07:41.750
YOU GOTTA TRUST ME. NOW PRESS

07:41.792 --> 07:44.250
GO.

07:44.291 --> 07:45.792
AAH! AH!

07:45.834 --> 07:47.041

07:50.792 --> 07:52.041
YEAH, THAT JUST,
YOU KNOW, WASN'T...
THANK YOU.

07:52.083 --> 07:55.583
UM... YOU KNOW,
HOW I REMEMBERED IT.

07:55.625 --> 07:57.041
(laughs)

07:57.083 --> 08:00.083
ALL RIGHT. LET ME GET A NURSE
TO IMMOBILIZE THAT.

08:00.125 --> 08:02.291
THANK YOU.

08:04.083 --> 08:05.250
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE GONNA
RUN OUT OF QUESTIONS

08:05.291 --> 08:06.291
TO ASK ME ABOUT SCHOOL.

08:06.333 --> 08:07.667
AND SINCE
WE ALREADY COVERED ETHAN,

08:07.709 --> 08:08.959
WHOSE LAST NAME
WILL REMAIN UNKNOWN

08:09.000 --> 08:10.041
FOR SECURITY REASONS...

08:10.083 --> 08:11.500
(laughs)

08:11.542 --> 08:13.125
SOONER OR LATER, WE'RE GONNA
GET AROUND TO YOU.

08:13.166 --> 08:14.583
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO KNOW?

08:14.625 --> 08:16.500
ARE YOU HAPPY?

08:16.542 --> 08:18.333
UM, I'M HEADED THERE.

08:18.375 --> 08:22.125
I-I LIKE THE PRACTICE.
THE PEOPLE ARE GREAT.

08:22.166 --> 08:23.417
GOOD, SMART DOCS.

08:23.458 --> 08:25.000
BUT?

08:25.041 --> 08:27.417
WELL, I'M--
I'M THE NEW GUY, RIGHT?

08:27.458 --> 08:28.625
I MEAN, I'VE BEEN THERE
FOR A WHILE.

08:28.667 --> 08:30.083
I'M STARTING TO FIT IN,

08:30.125 --> 08:33.083
BUT I DON'T KNOW, I'M KIND OF
THE OLD NEW GUY NOW.

08:33.125 --> 08:35.166
SO WHO'S THE WOMAN?

08:35.208 --> 08:37.041
I DIDN'T, UH, I DIDN'T
SAY ANYTHING ABOUT A WOMAN.

08:37.083 --> 08:39.375
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO.

08:39.417 --> 08:40.583
ANGE.

08:40.625 --> 08:42.417
JAKE.

08:42.458 --> 08:44.792
(clears throat)
IT'S, UH...

08:44.834 --> 08:47.458
IT'S COMPLICATED.

08:47.500 --> 08:49.041
BUT YOU LIKE COMPLICATED.

08:49.083 --> 08:51.417
YOU HUNG AROUND
WITH MY MOTHER...

08:51.458 --> 08:52.667
WHO WAS A DRUG ADDICT

08:52.709 --> 08:54.333
AND HAD
AN 8-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER.

08:54.375 --> 08:55.625
COME ON.

08:57.083 --> 08:58.667
HER NAME IS ADDISON.

08:58.709 --> 09:00.834
AND SHE'S BEAUTIFUL
AND BRILLIANT

09:00.875 --> 09:03.458
AND FRUSTRATING.

09:03.500 --> 09:06.583
YOU KNOW WHEN SOMEONE IS,
UM, IS CONFUSED, THEY--

09:06.625 --> 09:09.834
THEY--THEY START
SENDING OUT MIXED SIGNALS?

09:09.875 --> 09:11.959
SHE'S DOING THAT?

09:12.000 --> 09:14.041
I THINK I AM.

09:16.458 --> 09:19.709
YOU KNOW, MOM WOULD
WANT YOU TO BE HAPPY.

09:19.750 --> 09:21.333
SHE WOULD.

09:29.500 --> 09:30.458
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

09:30.500 --> 09:31.583
I WANT YOU TO TAKE ME HOME.

09:31.625 --> 09:34.166
CORINNE, WE'RE NOT THERE YET.

09:34.208 --> 09:36.625
WILL YOU TAKE ME HOME?

09:36.667 --> 09:38.458
ALL RIGHT, LOOK...

09:40.083 --> 09:41.458
I WANT YOU TO GET BETTER.

09:41.500 --> 09:44.500
THAT WON'T HAPPEN
IN THIS PLACE.

09:44.542 --> 09:45.709
YOU TOOK ME OUT OF JAIL,

09:45.750 --> 09:48.834
AND IT'S LIKE I'M A PRISONER
ALL OVER AGAIN.

09:48.875 --> 09:50.333
YOU KNOW, I'M AFRAID
IF I DON'T SMILE,

09:50.375 --> 09:51.792
THEY'LL SEDATE ME.

09:54.500 --> 09:56.625
I'M NOT A PERSON HERE,

09:56.667 --> 09:58.667
NOT HUMAN.

09:58.709 --> 10:01.250
I DON'T WANT
TO DO THIS ANYMORE.

10:01.291 --> 10:04.959
JUST... PLEASE JUST
GET ME OUTTA HERE.

10:07.000 --> 10:09.125
OKAY.

10:11.500 --> 10:13.458
OKAY.

10:18.083 --> 10:19.291
NO, IT'S JUST A LITTLE EARLY.

10:19.333 --> 10:20.750
YOU USUALLY DON'T POP BY.
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

10:20.792 --> 10:22.333
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
WITH THAT?

10:22.375 --> 10:24.125
OH, GARBAGE DISPOSAL BROKE.

10:24.166 --> 10:25.667
AND YOU'RE FIXING IT, HUH?

10:25.709 --> 10:28.000
I WOULD'VE THOUGHT
THAT YOU HAD SOMEONE TO--

10:28.041 --> 10:30.583
COME ON. I PERFORM LIFESAVING
SURGERIES ON BABIES IN THE WOMB.

10:30.625 --> 10:33.750
I CAN CERTAINLY
FIX MY OWN SINK.

10:33.792 --> 10:36.291
AND THE HANDYMAN WAS BACKED UP
FOR THREE DAYS, SO...

10:36.333 --> 10:38.041
AH.
OKAY. WHAT'S GOING ON?

10:38.083 --> 10:40.583
I WENT TO THE HOSPITAL
THIS MORNING TO VISIT CORINNE,

10:40.625 --> 10:43.166
AND SAM HAD CHECKED HER OUT.

10:43.208 --> 10:45.291
I TOLD HIM IT WAS A MISTAKE.

10:45.333 --> 10:47.291
YOU DON'T THINK THAT CORINNE
CAN GET BETTER AT HOME?

10:47.333 --> 10:49.291
I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH BETTER
SHE CAN GET AT ALL.

10:49.333 --> 10:50.583
AND EVEN WITH THE BEST MEDS,

10:50.625 --> 10:52.583
CORINNE WILL STRUGGLE
WITH CHRONIC MENTAL ILLNESS,

10:52.625 --> 10:54.917
AND IT'S GONNA BE DIFFICULT
JUST TO...

10:54.959 --> 10:56.333
JUST TO KEEP HER STABLE.

10:56.375 --> 10:57.792
SAM DOESN'T WANT
TO HEAR ALL THAT.

10:57.834 --> 10:59.333
WELL, IT'S HIS SISTER,

10:59.375 --> 11:01.917
AND WE DO HAVE
AN OBLIGATION TO FAMILY.

11:01.959 --> 11:03.041
TO THAT EXTENT
THAT WE CAN HELP,

11:03.083 --> 11:04.709
BUT SOMETIMES
THE HELP THAT FAMILIES OFFER

11:04.750 --> 11:06.792
CAN PREVENT THE PATIENT
FROM GETTING PROPER OVERSIGHT

11:06.834 --> 11:08.750
THAT HE REALLY NEEDS, AND...

11:08.792 --> 11:12.000
(sighs) CORINNE WENT THROUGH
A GLASS DOOR.

11:12.041 --> 11:14.917
WHAT IF IT'S FIRE
NEXT TIME?

11:14.959 --> 11:16.750
YOU WANT ME TO TALK TO HIM?
AND WHAT WOULD YOU SAY?

11:16.792 --> 11:18.041
WELL, YOU MADE
A LOGICAL APPEAL.

11:18.083 --> 11:19.750
I WOULD MAKE
AN EMOTIONAL APPEAL.

11:19.792 --> 11:20.959
I THINK THAT MAKES SENSE.

11:21.000 --> 11:22.500
(object clatters)

11:22.542 --> 11:24.166
(taps metal)

11:24.208 --> 11:26.792
(exhales) OKAY.

11:29.875 --> 11:31.458
DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT SINKS?

11:31.500 --> 11:32.750
NO.

11:32.792 --> 11:35.333
THAT'S GONNA LEAVE A SCAR?

11:35.375 --> 11:37.333
WELL, I'M GONNA DO
THE BEST I CAN,

11:37.375 --> 11:39.583
BUT, UH... YEAH.

11:39.625 --> 11:40.959
AT LEAST YOU'LL HAVE
SOME BRAGGING RIGHTS

11:41.000 --> 11:42.750
WITH THE OTHER PARAMEDICS.

11:42.792 --> 11:44.667
JUST NOT WITH VIOLET.
HOW SO?

11:44.709 --> 11:47.625
I GET THE FEELING
SHE'S NOT IMPRESSED.

11:47.667 --> 11:48.792
AH, SHE'S JUST SCARED.

11:48.834 --> 11:50.834
IT'S KINDA LIKE A... A MOTHER

11:50.875 --> 11:53.750
SCOLDING HER KID FOR RUNNING OUT
IN THE STREET WITHOUT LOOKING.

11:53.792 --> 11:55.041
SHE'S NOT REALLY ANGRY.

11:55.083 --> 11:59.583
SHE'S JUST TERRIFIED SOMETHING
MUCH WORSE COULDA HAPPENED.

11:59.625 --> 12:04.166
I'M GONNA TRY NOT TO READ
INTO THAT WHOLE CHILD ANALOGY.

12:04.208 --> 12:05.625
(sighs) HEY, LOOK,

12:05.667 --> 12:08.375
BELIEVE IT OR NOT,
I'M HAPPY FOR YOU AND VIOLET.

12:08.417 --> 12:09.834
I DO FIND THAT
HARD TO BELIEVE.

12:09.875 --> 12:11.625
WE'VE REACHED A PLACE
IN OUR FRIENDSHIP,

12:11.667 --> 12:13.500
IN OUR COPARENTING.

12:13.542 --> 12:15.917
SHE'S GOT YOU NOW,
AND I'M DATING SOMEONE, SO...

12:15.959 --> 12:17.792
HI.

12:17.834 --> 12:19.625
(monitor beeping erratically)

12:19.667 --> 12:20.583
WHAT HAPPENED?

12:20.625 --> 12:24.250
HE PASSED OUT.
B.P. IS 90 OVER 50.

12:24.291 --> 12:26.500
HIS ABDOMEN'S RIGID.
HE'S BLEEDING INTO HIS BELLY.

12:26.542 --> 12:28.041
CROSS AND MATCH TIMES FOUR.
GET IN TOUCH WITH THE O.R.

12:28.083 --> 12:29.625
(Violet)
I'M GONNA GO WITH YOU.

12:29.667 --> 12:31.041
NO, YOU STAY HERE.

12:31.083 --> 12:32.083
I'LL COME GET YOU AND SOON
AS I KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON.

12:37.083 --> 12:39.667
HEY.

12:39.709 --> 12:40.625
OH, HEY.

12:40.667 --> 12:41.709
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

12:41.750 --> 12:43.041
UH, OH, CORINNE'S
TAKING A BATH, SO...

12:43.083 --> 12:45.041
I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE
SHE'S OKAY.

12:45.083 --> 12:46.625
OH.

12:46.667 --> 12:49.041
I WAS JUST...

12:49.083 --> 12:51.041
MAKING SURE
THAT YOU'RE OKAY.

12:51.083 --> 12:53.041
OH, I'M FINE.

12:53.083 --> 12:54.417
YEAH? AND CORINNE?

12:54.458 --> 12:56.250
SHE'S FINE. SHE'S FINE.

12:56.291 --> 12:59.041
YOU KNOW, IT'S--
IT'S AN ADJUSTMENT.

12:59.083 --> 13:02.709
BUT WE'RE--
WE'RE FIGURING IT OUT.

13:04.917 --> 13:06.041
CORINNE?

13:06.083 --> 13:07.750
I'M STILL HERE, SAM.
(water splashes)

13:12.083 --> 13:14.041
I CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE HOW...

13:14.083 --> 13:15.250
PAINFUL THIS MUST BE
FOR YOU.

13:15.291 --> 13:17.250
YEAH.

13:17.291 --> 13:21.333
YOU COULD HIRE SOMEONE
TO HELP,

13:21.375 --> 13:23.333
FIND SOMEWHERE
FOR HER TO STAY

13:23.375 --> 13:25.250
WHERE SHE CAN GET
THE CARE SHE NEEDS.

13:25.291 --> 13:27.333
COME ON, ADDISON.

13:27.375 --> 13:30.000
YOU KNOW I'M NOT GONNA DO
ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

13:31.583 --> 13:33.792
I KNOW.

13:33.834 --> 13:36.709
THAT'S WHY I'M WORRIED.

13:39.375 --> 13:42.291
I APPRECIATE IT.
I REALLY DO.

13:42.333 --> 13:45.041
I'M GONNA BE FINE.

13:45.083 --> 13:46.875
REALLY.

13:57.166 --> 13:59.834
THIS IS RYAN'S BABY.

13:59.875 --> 14:02.542
I CAN'T ABORT
RYAN'S BABY.

14:02.583 --> 14:06.291
AND... I CAN'T GIVE AWAY
RYAN'S BABY.

14:08.333 --> 14:10.041
SO YOU'RE HAVING
RYAN'S BABY?

14:10.083 --> 14:11.959
YEAH.

14:12.000 --> 14:15.208
I'M HAVING RYAN'S BABY.

14:15.250 --> 14:18.333
HOW ABOUT THAT?

14:20.834 --> 14:22.041
HEY.

14:22.083 --> 14:23.041
MORNING.

14:23.083 --> 14:26.250
HOW ARE YOU?

14:26.291 --> 14:27.208
WHAT?

14:27.250 --> 14:29.208
YOU REALLY WANT TO MAKE
A BABY WITH ME?

14:29.250 --> 14:31.208
YOU'RE NOT READY.

14:31.250 --> 14:32.667
(laughs)

14:32.709 --> 14:34.041
I MEAN, I-I THINK
SHE'S STILL IN SHOCK. SHE--

14:34.083 --> 14:36.041
WHO?
OH, VIOLET.

14:36.083 --> 14:37.750
SCOTT WAS BADLY BEATEN
ON A RUN LAST NIGHT.

14:37.792 --> 14:39.041
IS HE OKAY?

14:39.083 --> 14:40.417
(Sheldon) HE'S IN SURGERY.
VIOLET'S AT THE HOSPITAL.

14:40.458 --> 14:41.750
AND IT WAS PETE
THAT WAS WORKING ON HIM.

14:41.792 --> 14:43.250
OH, THAT'S AWKWARD.

14:43.291 --> 14:44.542
I SHOULD GO SEE HER.

14:44.583 --> 14:46.041
WHAT?

14:46.083 --> 14:48.000
NOTHING.

14:49.291 --> 14:51.583
HEY, SAM.
UH, HOW'S CORINNE DOING?

14:51.625 --> 14:53.041
SHE'S ALL RIGHT.
THANKS.

14:53.083 --> 14:54.500
SAM.
YEAH.

14:54.542 --> 14:55.792
IF YOU NEED ANYTHING--

14:55.834 --> 14:58.041
THANK YOU. WE'RE OKAY.

14:58.083 --> 15:00.041
(cell phone alert chimes)

15:00.083 --> 15:01.458
MASON, YOU ARE NOT SUPPOSED
TO USE YOUR CELL PHONE

15:01.500 --> 15:02.917
FROM SCHOOL.

15:02.959 --> 15:05.000
ARE SAM AND CORINNE OKAY?
(Addison) I TRIED.

15:05.041 --> 15:06.166
(Sheldon) I'M SURE YOU DID.

15:06.208 --> 15:07.917
WELL, IS IT TIME
FOR ANOTHER INTERVENTION?

15:07.959 --> 15:09.834
WAIT. SLOW DOWN.
I CAN'T UNDERSTAND YOU.
TOO SOON?

15:09.875 --> 15:12.667
OKAY, JUST STAY PUT.
WE WILL BE RIGHT THERE.

15:12.709 --> 15:14.041
I LOVE YOU.

15:14.083 --> 15:16.041
IT'S ERICA.
THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG.

15:25.083 --> 15:27.041
OH, IT'S--
OH, IT HURTS.

15:27.083 --> 15:28.083
(gasps)

15:28.125 --> 15:29.834
AH. (gasps)
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?

15:29.875 --> 15:31.333
MASE.
DAD.

15:31.375 --> 15:32.625
(moans)
IT'S OKAY.
WE'RE HERE. WE'RE HERE.

15:32.667 --> 15:34.041
WHAT'S GOING ON?

15:34.083 --> 15:36.041
SHE'S COMPLAINING OF CRAMPY
ABDOMINAL PAIN WITH DISTENSION.

15:36.083 --> 15:37.208
WELL, THAT CAN'T BE
SECONDARY TO NEUROSURGERY,

15:37.250 --> 15:38.417
NOT IN HER ABDOMEN.

15:38.458 --> 15:40.041
ERICA, ANY HEADACHES,
WEAKNESS?

15:40.083 --> 15:41.542
(strained voice)
NO, NO. MY STOMACH.

15:41.583 --> 15:43.041
(Pete) I ORDERED
AN ABDOMINAL C.T.

15:43.083 --> 15:45.041
OH, I THINK I'M GONNA...

15:45.083 --> 15:46.041
(grunts)

15:46.083 --> 15:48.667
(vomits and coughs)

15:48.709 --> 15:50.041
(chokes)
IS THAT BLOOD?

15:50.083 --> 15:51.291
COOPER, TAKE HIM AWAY.
OHH!

15:51.333 --> 15:53.041
I DON'T WANT TO GO.

15:53.083 --> 15:54.125
WE'LL BRING YOU BACK AFTER
THE DOCTORS HELP YOUR MOM, OKAY?

15:54.166 --> 15:56.041
NOW COME ON, MASON.
COME ON.
I LOVE YOU, MOMMY.

15:56.083 --> 15:57.333
I LOVE YOU.

15:57.375 --> 15:58.500
(pants)

15:59.917 --> 16:02.041
HOW COME YOU'RE NOT EATING?

16:02.083 --> 16:03.500
I'M NOT HUNGRY.

16:03.542 --> 16:04.750
COME ON, CORINNE.

16:04.792 --> 16:06.333
I CAN'T MAKE MYSELF HUNGRY.

16:06.375 --> 16:08.041
LOOK...
(dishes clatter)

16:08.083 --> 16:09.041
IF WE'RE GONNA DO THIS,

16:09.083 --> 16:11.041
THERE HAVE TO BE RULES,
RIGHT?

16:11.083 --> 16:12.333
YOU GOTTA GET
EIGHT HOURS OF SLEEP,

16:12.375 --> 16:14.041
YOU GOTTA EAT PROPERLY,

16:14.083 --> 16:15.000
TAKE YOUR MEDS.

16:15.041 --> 16:16.542
YEAH, OKAY, OKAY.

16:16.583 --> 16:17.500
(pill rattles)

16:17.542 --> 16:19.000
THANK YOU.

16:21.125 --> 16:22.375
THERE YOU GO.

16:34.667 --> 16:36.834
OPEN YOUR MOUTH.

16:36.875 --> 16:38.375
(sets bottle down)

16:38.417 --> 16:40.750
COME ON. (chuckles)
OPEN UP. I CAN'T SEE.

16:40.792 --> 16:42.792
ALL RIGHT.

16:42.834 --> 16:45.041
(slides dish)

16:45.083 --> 16:46.500
IF I WANTED
TO BE HUMILIATED,

16:46.542 --> 16:47.709
I COULD'VE STAYED
IN THE HOSPITAL.

16:47.750 --> 16:49.000
OH, COME ON, CORINNE.

16:49.041 --> 16:50.166
I DON'T WANT TO DO THAT.

16:50.208 --> 16:51.583
YOU KNOW THAT'S NOT
WHAT I'M DOING, OKAY?

16:51.625 --> 16:53.875
NOW EAT YOUR FOOD.

16:55.667 --> 16:57.125
(sighs)

16:57.166 --> 16:59.041
LOOK, I'M SORRY.
I'M SORRY.

16:59.083 --> 17:00.166
ALL RIGHT?
I'M JUST TRYING TO--

17:00.208 --> 17:01.333
IT'S NOT THAT.

17:01.375 --> 17:03.667
(sighs)

17:03.709 --> 17:05.166
WELL, THEN WHAT IS IT?

17:05.208 --> 17:08.625
(sighs)

17:08.667 --> 17:12.041
I DON'T WANT TO BE HERE.

17:12.083 --> 17:14.250
OKAY, WELL, YOU SAID YOU WANTED
TO COME BACK HOME, SO--

17:14.291 --> 17:17.041
NO, I DON'T MEAN HERE
IN YOUR HOME.

17:17.083 --> 17:22.041
I MEAN HERE ON EARTH,
ALIVE.

17:22.083 --> 17:23.208
AND DON'T WORRY.

17:23.250 --> 17:24.667
I DON'T HAVE THE COURAGE
TO KILL MYSELF.

17:24.709 --> 17:27.667
IT COULD BE WORSE
ON THE OTHER SIDE.

17:27.709 --> 17:31.834
I'D PROBABLY JUST...
SCREW IT UP

17:31.875 --> 17:35.834
AND BECOME A QUADRIPLEGIC
OR SO--

17:35.875 --> 17:38.834
THE WORST PLACE FOR ME,
THE SCARIEST PLACE FOR ME,

17:38.875 --> 17:40.834
IS IN MY MIND,
AND THAT'S ALL I'D HAVE LEFT.

17:40.875 --> 17:45.041
SO I'M NOT GONNA DO IT,
BUT...

17:45.083 --> 17:47.208
I DON'T WANT TO BE HERE.

17:49.041 --> 17:50.417
(exhales)

17:50.458 --> 17:54.000
OKAY.

17:54.041 --> 17:56.000
I KNOW IT MAY SEEM
LIKE IT,

17:56.041 --> 17:59.417
BUT YOU'RE NOT GONNA
FEEL THIS WAY FOREVER.

18:03.917 --> 18:06.041
OKAY?

18:06.083 --> 18:09.291
YEAH,
I'M SURE YOU'RE RIGHT.

18:09.333 --> 18:10.667
(sniffles)

18:10.709 --> 18:12.750
ALL RIGHT.

18:15.667 --> 18:18.083
I JUST SAW PETE.

18:18.125 --> 18:20.125
SCOTT HAD A DELAYED RUPTURE OF
HIS SPLEEN DUE TO THE TRAUMA,

18:20.166 --> 18:21.875
AND THEY HAD TO REMOVE IT.

18:21.917 --> 18:23.250
IS HE GONNA BE OKAY?

18:23.291 --> 18:24.500
HE'S DOING FINE.

18:24.542 --> 18:25.709
UH, THEY'RE JUST
FINISHING UP NOW.

18:25.750 --> 18:27.083
THEY'LL MOVE HIM TO RECOVERY.

18:27.125 --> 18:28.834
WELL, THAT'S GOOD.

18:28.875 --> 18:30.041
HAVE YOU TALKED TO COOPER?

18:30.083 --> 18:31.291
NO. WHY?

18:31.333 --> 18:32.875
ERICA'S IN THE E.R.

18:32.917 --> 18:34.041
WHAT HAPPENED?

18:34.083 --> 18:36.291
SHE COLLAPSED.
MASON CALLED COOPER.

18:36.333 --> 18:37.542
IT'S... IT'S BAD.

18:37.583 --> 18:39.291
OKAY. WELL, WHERE IS HE?
I'LL GO SEE HIM.

18:39.333 --> 18:40.542
YEAH, COOPER'S WITH MASON
RIGHT NOW.

18:40.583 --> 18:41.834
I'D--I'D GIVE IT
A LITTLE WHILE.

18:41.875 --> 18:42.750
OKAY.

18:46.291 --> 18:47.875
ARE YOU GONNA BE OKAY?

18:47.917 --> 18:49.875
(laughs)

18:49.917 --> 18:53.291
WELL, MY BOYFRIEND
OR WHATEVER

18:53.333 --> 18:56.583
WHO--WHO I CARE ABOUT
WAS RUSHED INTO THE E.R.

18:56.625 --> 18:58.709
AND WAS TREATED BY MY HUSBAND,
WHO I ALSO CARE ABOUT.

18:58.750 --> 19:00.792
AND HE'S TRYING TO DECIDE
IF OUR MARRIAGE IS WORTH SAVING.

19:00.834 --> 19:03.709
AND NOW MY BEST FRIEND'S SON'S
MOTHER IS BACK IN THE HOSPITAL.

19:03.750 --> 19:05.458
SO... NOT OKAY.

19:05.500 --> 19:07.667
NOT SO MUCH. (laughs)

19:07.709 --> 19:09.208
NOT SO MUCH.

19:13.542 --> 19:15.709
YOU SAID MY MOM WAS OKAY.

19:15.750 --> 19:17.917
I THOUGHT SHE WAS,
AND SHE STILL MIGHT BE.

19:17.959 --> 19:19.750
SHE THREW UP BLOOD.
AND THAT'S NOT GOOD,

19:19.792 --> 19:21.750
BUT AMELIA AND PETE
AND CHARLOTTE,

19:21.792 --> 19:24.041
THEY'RE GONNA FIGURE IT OUT.

19:24.083 --> 19:25.750
ARE YOU LYING TO ME?

19:25.792 --> 19:27.166
NO.

19:27.208 --> 19:29.208
MASON, NO, I PROMISE.

19:29.250 --> 19:32.500
HEY, LOOK AT ME.

19:32.542 --> 19:35.583
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH YOUR MOM.

19:38.375 --> 19:40.083
BUT IF SHE'S SICK AGAIN,

19:40.125 --> 19:41.750
YOU HAVE TO TELL ME
THIS TIME.

19:41.792 --> 19:43.000
I PROMISE.

19:43.041 --> 19:43.959
SWEAR.

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
I SWEAR. I WILL TELL YOU
WHATEVER I KNOW.

19:54.083 --> 19:57.000
(Pete) HEY.

19:57.041 --> 19:59.041
JUST WANTED TO CHECK
AND SEE IF YOU WERE OKAY.

19:59.083 --> 20:00.542
HE'S STILL SLEEPING.

20:00.583 --> 20:02.458
I'M FINE.

20:02.500 --> 20:03.875
HOW'S ERICA?

20:03.917 --> 20:06.041
SHE'S STABLE.
AMELIA'S RUNNING SOME SCANS.

20:06.083 --> 20:08.208
WHERE'S COOPER?
IS HE STILL WITH MASON?

20:08.250 --> 20:09.542
YEAH. IT'S ROUGH.

20:09.583 --> 20:12.125
I JUST...
I KEEP THINKING,

20:12.166 --> 20:13.375
IF IT WAS ONE OF US...

20:13.417 --> 20:14.875
I KNOW. I CALLED THE NANNY.

20:14.917 --> 20:16.041
I HAD HER PUT LUCAS
ON THE PHONE TWICE ALREADY.

20:16.083 --> 20:17.542
I KNOW.

20:17.583 --> 20:19.041
I CALLED EARLIER, BUT HE'D
ALREADY GONE DOWN FOR A NAP.

20:19.083 --> 20:20.250
YEAH, WELL, DON'T WORRY.

20:20.291 --> 20:22.875
UM, I TOLD HIM
THAT I WAS WITH YOU.

20:22.917 --> 20:24.625
THANK YOU.

20:26.083 --> 20:29.041
VIOLET.

20:29.083 --> 20:31.083
HEY.

20:31.125 --> 20:33.041
HEY.

20:33.083 --> 20:34.291
HOW YOU FEELIN'?

20:34.333 --> 20:37.041
AWFUL. (chuckles)

20:37.083 --> 20:39.500
AH. SORE.

20:41.208 --> 20:42.583
THANK YOU.

20:42.625 --> 20:45.041
OH, COME ON.
NO PROBLEM.

20:45.083 --> 20:47.041
SO, UH...

20:47.083 --> 20:48.333
I WILL CATCH UP
WITH YOU GUYS LATER.

21:01.083 --> 21:02.667
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL DAY OUT.

21:02.709 --> 21:05.709
WANT TO GET SOME FRESH AIR,
GO FOR A WALK?

21:08.166 --> 21:09.917
WAIT. HOLD UP.

21:09.959 --> 21:10.875
NO, I'LL GO ALONE.

21:10.917 --> 21:12.709
NO, I'LL COME WITH YOU.

21:12.750 --> 21:15.125
SAM, I'LL WALK STRAIGHT OUT
TO THE BEACH.

21:15.166 --> 21:17.041
YOU'LL BE ABLE TO SEE ME.

21:17.083 --> 21:20.041
IF I PUT ROCKS IN MY POCKETS
AND START TO RUN INTO THE OCEAN,

21:20.083 --> 21:22.125
YOU'LL NOTICE.

21:22.166 --> 21:25.917
(sighs deeply)

21:28.792 --> 21:30.041
SAM.

21:30.083 --> 21:31.041
HEY.

21:31.083 --> 21:34.041
WERE YOU--WERE YOU GONNA
GO WITH YOUR SISTER?

21:34.083 --> 21:36.417
UH, NO.

21:38.959 --> 21:40.458
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

21:40.500 --> 21:42.000
SHE SAID SHE'D RATHER
BE DEAD.

21:42.041 --> 21:44.458
SO I DON'T KNOW IF SHE
REALLY FEELS LIKE THAT

21:44.500 --> 21:46.041
OR IF IT'S SOME KIND OF
CRY FOR HELP

21:46.083 --> 21:47.166
BUT I JUST FEEL LIKE
I NEED TO--

21:47.208 --> 21:48.875
SUICIDE-PROOF THE HOUSE?

21:48.917 --> 21:50.041
SAM...

21:50.083 --> 21:52.500
YOU CAN'T DO THIS.

21:52.542 --> 21:54.959
YOU CANNOT WATCH HER
EVERY SECOND.

21:55.000 --> 21:56.291
IT'S TOO MUCH.

21:56.333 --> 21:57.917
WE'VE BEEN THROUGH THIS.

21:57.959 --> 21:59.667
NO, NO, YOU'VE PUT ME OFF.
LISTEN TO ME.

21:59.709 --> 22:02.458
I GET WANTING TO DO ANYTHING
YOU CAN FOR YOUR FAMILY.

22:02.500 --> 22:04.041
I GET IT.

22:04.083 --> 22:05.417
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE DOING THIS
BECAUSE YOU FEEL A SENSE OF--

22:05.458 --> 22:06.917
OF RESPONSIBILITY
AND GUILT.

22:06.959 --> 22:09.375
BUT I AM TELLING YOU,
NO MATTER HOW HARD YOU TRY,

22:09.417 --> 22:11.834
YOU WON'T BRING CORINNE UP.
SHE'LL BRING YOU DOWN.

22:11.875 --> 22:14.375
AND THAT MAKES ME SCARED
FOR YOU.

22:14.417 --> 22:16.500
WELL...

22:16.542 --> 22:17.959
I MADE A PROMISE TO MY SISTER

22:18.000 --> 22:19.959
THAT I'D NEVER GIVE UP
ON HER.

22:20.000 --> 22:21.208
SO...

22:21.250 --> 22:23.166
I WON'T.

22:23.208 --> 22:25.417
CAN YOU JUST TAKE THESE,
PLEASE?

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
(blows air)

22:37.041 --> 22:39.959
(exhales deeply)

22:42.583 --> 22:44.250
THIS IS IT, HUH?

22:44.291 --> 22:47.125
THE GLIO
HAS METASTASIZED.

22:47.166 --> 22:49.625
ANOTHER TUMOR.

22:49.667 --> 22:51.834
(Charlotte) NOT JUST ONE.
IT'S IN YOUR LIVER,

22:51.875 --> 22:53.125
YOUR G.I. TRACT,

22:53.166 --> 22:54.667
AND IT'S ENCROACHING
ON YOUR SPINAL COLUMN.

22:54.709 --> 22:57.250
(exhales deeply)

22:57.291 --> 22:58.750
HOW LONG?

22:58.792 --> 23:00.750
THAT DEPENDS
ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS--

23:00.792 --> 23:01.959
HOW LONG?

23:02.000 --> 23:04.667
GIVEN THE BLEEDING,
MAYBE A WEEK.

23:07.000 --> 23:09.125
WHAT DO I HAVE
TO LOOK FORWARD TO?

23:09.166 --> 23:12.041
PARALYSIS IN YOUR LEGS.

23:12.083 --> 23:14.291
YOUR BOWELS WILL STOP WORKING.

23:14.333 --> 23:15.792
CONSTANT PAIN.

23:15.834 --> 23:17.166
HE CAN'T SEE THIS.

23:17.208 --> 23:20.041
ERICA, MASON WILL WANT TO BE
AROUND YOU AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE.

23:20.083 --> 23:22.041
(crying) MY SON
WILL NOT WATCH ME

23:22.083 --> 23:23.709
BECOME PATHETIC AND USELESS.

23:25.083 --> 23:27.583
HE WILL NOT WATCH

23:27.625 --> 23:29.667
BECAUSE THAT...

23:29.709 --> 23:30.875
(sobs)

23:30.917 --> 23:33.458
I LOVE HIM TOO MUCH TO SEE
THAT LOOK ON HIS FACE.

23:35.333 --> 23:39.667
(continues crying)
I CAN'T DO THAT TO HIM.

23:39.709 --> 23:42.041
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

23:42.083 --> 23:45.041
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

23:51.458 --> 23:54.959
(rustles bag)

23:56.542 --> 23:58.041
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

23:58.083 --> 24:00.166
WELL, THAT--THAT'S
A LOVELY GREETING. (kisses)

24:00.208 --> 24:01.375
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

24:01.417 --> 24:04.041
YEAH, YEAH, I JUST, UH...

24:04.083 --> 24:05.291
IS THAT A GUN?

24:05.333 --> 24:06.542
(sighs)

24:06.583 --> 24:07.834
DID YOU FIND OUT
ETHAN'S LAST NAME

24:07.875 --> 24:09.041
AND COME HERE
TO DEFEND MY VIRTUE?

24:09.083 --> 24:11.333
LOOK, ABOUT THAT, I'M...

24:11.375 --> 24:13.250
I'M SORRY
IF I WAS ACTING WEIRD

24:13.291 --> 24:17.041
WHEN YOU WERE TELLING ME
THAT THING YOU WERE TELLING ME.

24:17.083 --> 24:18.125
YOU'RE STILL ACTING WEIRD.

24:18.166 --> 24:20.250
I KNOW. LOOK, I...

24:20.291 --> 24:22.041
I'M JUST--I'M...

24:22.083 --> 24:23.750
IT'S GONNA TAKE ME A MINUTE
TO GET USED TO THE IDEA

24:23.792 --> 24:25.750
THAT YOU'RE A-A WOMAN.

24:25.792 --> 24:27.542
EW. DON'T CALL ME THAT.

24:27.583 --> 24:28.709
WELL, WHAT DO YOU WANT ME
TO CALL YOU?

24:28.750 --> 24:31.125
ANGE. (laughs)

24:31.166 --> 24:32.375
(mouths words)

24:32.417 --> 24:34.041
COME WALK ME
TO MY NEXT CLASS.

24:34.083 --> 24:35.333
ANYWAY, I'M FEELING...

24:35.375 --> 24:36.750
I DON'T KNOW,

24:36.792 --> 24:38.500
A LITTLE OUT OF MY DEPTH
WITH ALL OF THIS.

24:38.542 --> 24:40.000
I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
THE DIFFERENCE

24:40.041 --> 24:41.291
BETWEEN THINGS THAT WILL HELP

24:41.333 --> 24:44.041
AND THINGS
THAT WILL MAKE YOU CRINGE.

24:44.083 --> 24:47.083
OH, GOD.
WHAT'S IN THE BAG?

24:51.083 --> 24:52.583
SERIOUSLY?

24:52.625 --> 24:53.834
CONDOMS?

24:53.875 --> 24:55.041
JUST, YOU KNOW...

24:55.083 --> 24:56.917
YEAH, I KNOW.

24:56.959 --> 24:58.792
THANKS.

24:58.834 --> 25:01.250
SO YOU THINK MAYBE
ONE OF THESE DAYS

25:01.291 --> 25:03.041
I CAN MEET THIS ETHAN?

25:03.083 --> 25:04.959
I'D LIKE THAT.

25:05.000 --> 25:06.917
AND MAYBE ONE OF THESE DAYS,
I CAN MEET ADDISON.

25:06.959 --> 25:08.500
WE COULD DOUBLE DATE.

25:08.542 --> 25:10.917
UH, YEAH. I DON'T--
I DON'T THINK SO.

25:10.959 --> 25:12.041
WHY? WHAT'S HAPPENING
WITH HER?

25:12.083 --> 25:13.417
NOTHING'S HAPPENING
WITH HER.

25:13.458 --> 25:15.333
DON'T YOU WANT TO BE
WITH HER?

25:16.458 --> 25:17.959
I'D RATHER
HAVE YOUR MOM BACK.

25:18.000 --> 25:19.208
SO DO I,

25:19.250 --> 25:22.500
BUT IN A WORLD OF THINGS
THAT ACTUALLY COULD HAPPEN...

25:22.542 --> 25:25.166
LOOK, THE POINT IS,
BEING IN LOVE OR WHATEVER,

25:25.208 --> 25:28.041
JUST FEELS COMPLETELY AMAZING.

25:28.083 --> 25:30.417
AND I JUST FEEL,
YOU SHOULD TRY IT AGAIN.

25:32.083 --> 25:35.417
I CAN SAY THAT.
YOU JUST GAVE ME CONDOMS.

25:35.458 --> 25:37.083
(laughs)

25:41.083 --> 25:43.542
OKAY,
IT'S TIME TO TAKE IT.

25:43.583 --> 25:45.041
I'LL TAKE IT LATER.

25:45.083 --> 25:46.625
NO, YOU CAN'T DO THAT.

25:46.667 --> 25:48.458
NO, I HAVEN'T EATEN.

25:48.500 --> 25:50.458
ALL RIGHT. WELL, I'LL
GET YOU SOMETHING TO EAT.

25:50.500 --> 25:52.458
YOU KNOW,
I DON'T WANT TO, SAM.

25:52.500 --> 25:54.375
AND THESE PILLS
ARE NOT GONNA HELP ME.

25:54.417 --> 25:56.583
UH, CORINNE,
WE'RE NOT DOING THIS.

25:56.625 --> 25:57.875
OKAY?

25:57.917 --> 25:59.500
THE PILLS UPSET MY STOMACH.

25:59.542 --> 26:01.291
THAT'S BECAUSE
YOU'RE NOT EATING ENOUGH.

26:01.333 --> 26:02.542
MM.

26:05.083 --> 26:07.417
(mouth full) HAPPY NOW?

26:07.458 --> 26:10.208
YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO EAT SOME MORE.

26:10.250 --> 26:11.417
NO.

26:11.458 --> 26:12.917
(sighs) WELL, THEN
YOUR STOMACH'S GONNA HURT.

26:12.959 --> 26:14.208
BUT YOU HAVE TO TAKE
YOUR PILL, CORINNE.

26:14.250 --> 26:15.458
I'M NOT TAKING THE PILL.

26:15.500 --> 26:17.041
LOOK, LOOK, THIS IS NOT
A NEGOTIATION.

26:17.083 --> 26:18.417
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?

26:18.458 --> 26:20.041
BECAUSE WE MADE A DEAL.

26:20.083 --> 26:21.417
YOU SAID
THAT YOU WOULD TRY AND--

26:21.458 --> 26:24.000
AND YOU THINK I'M NOT TRYING?

26:24.041 --> 26:26.166
I THINK THAT YOU'RE
MAKING THIS A LOT HARDER

26:26.208 --> 26:27.667
THAN IT NEEDS--
YEAH, WELL, HARDER--
HARDER FOR YOU?

26:27.709 --> 26:30.291
I HAVE TO LIVE LIKE THIS.

26:30.333 --> 26:31.834
YOU WATCH ME,

26:31.875 --> 26:33.500
AND YOU ORDER ME AROUND,

26:33.542 --> 26:35.834
AND YOU--
AND YOU JUDGE--SILENTLY--

26:35.875 --> 26:37.041
BUT YOU JUDGE.

26:37.083 --> 26:39.041
I'M TRYING
TO TAKE CARE OF YOU.

26:39.083 --> 26:41.542
NOW PLEASE TAKE THAT PILL.

26:41.583 --> 26:43.041
NO.

UH, I DON'T KNOW WHO...

36:57.166 --> 36:58.333
I WAS.

36:58.375 --> 37:00.542
I...

37:00.583 --> 37:02.583
IT'S JUST HARD.

37:04.083 --> 37:07.041
THIS IS, UH, A LOT HARDER

AND--AND I KNOW THAT IT'S
IMPOSSIBLE FOR YOU,

37:10.208 --> 37:13.000
BUT, UH, SOMEHOW I...

I MADE IT ABOUT ME, AND--

37:14.250 --> 37:17.458

37:36.125 --> 37:38.500
I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO DO THIS.

37:40.250 --> 37:42.041
NOT THE RIGHT WAY.

37:42.083 --> 37:43.709
YOU'RE DOING YOUR BEST,

37:43.750 --> 37:47.000
