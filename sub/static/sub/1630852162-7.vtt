00:29.029 --> 00:31.656
<i>Entering Alpha Centauri orbit.</i>

00:32.615 --> 00:33.783
It looks fine.

00:33.867 --> 00:35.243
<i>Scan complete.</i>

00:35.326 --> 00:37.162
There's no sign of alien ships.

00:38.455 --> 00:40.582
<i>Jude, how's Will?</i>

00:42.584 --> 00:43.835
He's holding stable.

00:45.003 --> 00:46.046
What do you think?

00:46.963 --> 00:48.840
I think we should take a closer look.

01:33.760 --> 01:34.886
Girls, it's…

01:36.679 --> 01:37.597
it's beautiful.

01:38.723 --> 01:41.434
Would it have killed your mother
to put a window in here?

01:43.353 --> 01:45.605
<i>Jupiter 2,</i>
<i>this is operations.</i>

01:45.688 --> 01:47.774
<i>You're all clear for landing.</i>

01:47.857 --> 01:49.901
<i>Welcome home, Robinsons.</i>

01:52.028 --> 01:53.029
On approach.

02:25.436 --> 02:28.189
Before I go out there,
I need to know, are we good?

02:28.273 --> 02:29.941
We're bracing for an alien attack.

02:30.525 --> 02:34.988
Will's in critical condition, and…
and you're worried about being arrested?

02:37.031 --> 02:39.284
Hope for the best,
prepare for the worst, right?

02:40.869 --> 02:44.164
Well, we talked,
and we all agreed to let karma handle it.

02:44.956 --> 02:47.834
You know, in the end,
everyone gets what they deserve.

02:48.918 --> 02:50.587
<i>Come on, everyone. Let's go.</i>

02:51.171 --> 02:54.299
This is Judy Robinson of the Jupiter 2
requesting escort to medical.

02:54.883 --> 02:55.842
Hey, no!

02:56.634 --> 02:57.760
You stay here.

02:58.928 --> 03:02.056
Most of the colonists here
have never seen an alien robot.

03:02.849 --> 03:04.184
We don't wanna scare 'em.

03:12.984 --> 03:15.278
This way. Follow me.
The doctors are waiting.

03:15.987 --> 03:17.864
Waiting to get
the nano-sequencing back.

03:17.947 --> 03:19.949
Family members only beyond this point.

03:20.033 --> 03:20.950
Family only.

03:23.286 --> 03:24.704
We're ready for him.

03:26.080 --> 03:26.956
Wait.

03:27.665 --> 03:28.583
Are you family?

03:29.125 --> 03:30.043
Um…

03:30.543 --> 03:31.502
No.

03:32.045 --> 03:33.713
No, I guess I'm not.

03:38.468 --> 03:40.428
-We've got it.
-I need to give you the report--

03:40.511 --> 03:42.222
You haven't been through decontamination.

03:42.305 --> 03:44.098
We received your transmission
and his charts.

03:44.182 --> 03:47.060
Thanks to what you did up there
and the resources we have here,

03:47.143 --> 03:49.854
I promise you,
your brother's going to make it.

03:54.651 --> 03:56.402
-He's gonna make it.

04:01.366 --> 04:02.283
Okay.

04:03.117 --> 04:04.452
-Okay.

04:06.329 --> 04:08.331
-We need to warn the others.
-Yeah.

04:08.831 --> 04:12.252
Judy, stay and see if you can get
something for your shoulder.

04:12.335 --> 04:13.253
Okay.

05:02.135 --> 05:05.471
<i>ID chip scanned.</i>
<i>Hello, Dr. Zoe Smith.</i>

05:05.555 --> 05:08.266
<i>Where would you like to navigate?</i>
<i>Work or home?</i>

05:08.349 --> 05:09.267
Home.

05:18.151 --> 05:21.279
-There's still no sign of them.
-Maureen. John!

05:23.656 --> 05:25.241
-Hey.
-Where've you been?

05:25.325 --> 05:27.493
You didn't follow us.
We were worried something happened.

05:27.577 --> 05:28.578
-Oh!
-Something did.

05:29.120 --> 05:30.121
We have bad news.

05:30.204 --> 05:32.415
Can't remember a time
you arrived with good news.

05:32.498 --> 05:34.334
That's fair, but this could be the worst.

05:40.381 --> 05:41.299
Hey.

05:46.846 --> 05:48.014
Oh my God!

05:50.933 --> 05:51.934
-Hi!
-Oh!

05:52.518 --> 05:55.396
Listen, I'm so sorry.
I should have stayed on your Jupiter.

05:55.897 --> 05:57.774
It's okay. I had my family.

05:57.857 --> 06:00.818
It's just, what kind of guy
leaves a girl alone in a time of crisis?

06:02.153 --> 06:03.905
Here, um… I got these for you.

06:04.447 --> 06:05.490
Flowers!

06:05.573 --> 06:08.534
Not just any flowers.
Alpha Centauri humming flowers.

06:08.618 --> 06:11.120
When the wind blows through them,
it sounds like music.

06:11.204 --> 06:13.539
I wouldn't get too close.
They sound better than they smell.

06:13.623 --> 06:15.291
Really?

06:15.375 --> 06:16.501
Oh wow.

06:16.584 --> 06:19.295
-Should call them farting flowers.

06:21.714 --> 06:22.548
Um…

06:23.257 --> 06:24.217
Thank you.

06:25.093 --> 06:26.177
They're beautiful.

06:33.935 --> 06:35.103
Any-- anyways, um…

06:35.603 --> 06:38.898
it's really great that you made it,
and I hope that your brother's okay.

06:40.316 --> 06:41.275
Thank you.

06:41.901 --> 06:42.860
Really.

06:47.740 --> 06:49.575
Oh, actually, um…

06:51.244 --> 06:52.912
there's something you both should know.

06:54.539 --> 06:55.873
<i>Thank you for the warning.</i>

06:57.333 --> 07:00.128
If what you're saying is true,
shouldn't these robots be here?

07:00.211 --> 07:02.130
We've been asking ourselves
the same thing,

07:02.213 --> 07:05.174
but I'd rather be wrong and ready
than right and dead.

07:05.258 --> 07:06.759
Unfortunately, Madam Chancellor,

07:06.843 --> 07:10.221
I've found the Robinsons to be almost
always accurate in their conclusions.

07:13.933 --> 07:18.646
So, everything we believed
about how we got here was a lie.

07:18.729 --> 07:20.982
Does the colony have
any kind of defense system?

07:21.065 --> 07:22.984
Until now, I wasn't aware we needed one.

07:23.985 --> 07:26.779
Look, our priority has been
getting basic services running.

07:26.863 --> 07:28.739
Water supply, power, et cetera.

07:28.823 --> 07:31.492
I'm afraid
if we're going to defend ourselves,

07:32.160 --> 07:33.494
we'll have to find another way.

07:44.422 --> 07:45.423
How's he doing?

07:47.091 --> 07:51.012
Oh, his vitals are strong.
They're giving him an artificial heart.

07:51.095 --> 07:52.680
-What?
-He'll be okay.

07:53.222 --> 07:55.266
With the bad air quality back on Earth,

07:55.349 --> 07:57.810
I knew kids on the track team
that got artificial lungs

07:57.894 --> 07:59.187
and never missed a beat.

07:59.270 --> 08:01.939
Yeah, but Will's heart
is like his superpower.

08:02.565 --> 08:04.775
A heart isn't determined
by what it's made of.

08:04.859 --> 08:07.945
It's… it's what you believe in.
It's what you fight for.

08:10.823 --> 08:12.700
Will isn't gonna let that change.

08:13.284 --> 08:15.703
Judy, he knew these robots
better than anyone.

08:17.455 --> 08:20.500
If Will couldn't beat SAR, what makes us
think we can do it without him?

08:21.000 --> 08:23.127
<i>Can we divert enough energy</i>
<i>for a kill box?</i>

08:23.211 --> 08:25.713
I'm not sure the robots
would fall for that again, but--

08:25.796 --> 08:27.381
We have quite a bit of solar,

08:27.465 --> 08:29.717
some wind, as you saw
from the turbines as you flew in,

08:29.800 --> 08:35.431
but the bulk of our energy
is actually, uh, hydroelectric, the dam.

08:35.515 --> 08:38.392
Can you, uh-- pull that grid up for me?

08:38.476 --> 08:39.477
Yeah.

08:42.188 --> 08:44.065
-That's odd.
-What?

08:44.607 --> 08:46.692
-Can I-- can I borrow this?
-Uh…

08:47.485 --> 08:49.695
The numbers, they're--
they're not adding up.

08:51.405 --> 08:55.201
The settlement, it's making
way more power than it needs.

08:55.284 --> 08:58.204
I'd imagine that's just
to accommodate for future growth.

08:58.287 --> 09:01.457
I didn't see enough infrastructure
that would need that kind of power.

09:01.958 --> 09:03.000
Unless…

09:06.504 --> 09:08.214
Where do you keep your prisoners?

09:11.425 --> 09:16.222
"As flies to wanton boys
are we to the gods."

09:18.349 --> 09:20.268
"They kill us for their sport."

09:23.563 --> 09:24.564
<i>King Lear.</i>

09:27.984 --> 09:29.944
Never could get used
to reading off screens.

09:30.027 --> 09:33.990
There's something about the feel
of turning a page, don't you think?

09:34.574 --> 09:36.325
Depends if it's a good book.

09:36.909 --> 09:38.578
Some are just better left closed.

09:38.661 --> 09:42.123
And yet here you are,
locked up on that sunshine base.

09:42.206 --> 09:43.874
You…

09:44.458 --> 09:46.877
You ignored me for a year.

09:47.503 --> 09:49.046
So why the sudden urge to chat?

09:49.130 --> 09:51.465
The chancellor told us
there's no defense system

09:51.549 --> 09:52.675
here on Alpha Centauri.

09:53.593 --> 09:54.677
And you think she's lying?

09:54.760 --> 09:57.513
No, we don't think she's lying.
We think she was kept in the dark.

09:57.597 --> 10:00.975
Ah, well, one man's darkness
is another man's light.

10:01.058 --> 10:02.810
They know where we are.

10:03.811 --> 10:06.939
The robots, they know
the location of Alpha Centauri.

10:13.362 --> 10:14.322
How do you mean?

10:14.405 --> 10:16.907
Whatever secrets
you were hoping to take to your grave,

10:16.991 --> 10:21.829
you're going to take them there today
unless you help us.

10:25.541 --> 10:26.459
Okay.

10:28.294 --> 10:29.337
Yes.

10:30.004 --> 10:31.797
We prepared a system of EMFs,

10:33.132 --> 10:36.260
hidden here, so we could
defend the colony against any, uh…

10:36.927 --> 10:38.596
any unforeseen aggression.

10:38.679 --> 10:40.973
-Unforeseen?
-Relax, John.

10:41.057 --> 10:42.725
I think we can help each other.

10:43.392 --> 10:46.228
I'll provide the keys
to turn the system on.

10:46.812 --> 10:50.441
And in return,
you will explain to the chancellor

10:50.524 --> 10:53.944
that the accusations against me
were a misunderstanding,

10:54.028 --> 10:56.614
and I can be
of much greater service to the colony

10:57.156 --> 11:00.368
if my authority is restored.

11:01.202 --> 11:02.370
Men like you…

11:03.829 --> 11:06.040
contingencies on contingencies.

11:07.625 --> 11:09.627
You'd have someone else here with access

11:09.710 --> 11:11.587
in case anything happened to you
in transit.

11:11.671 --> 11:16.509
So how about we find out whoever that is,
and you sit in here and rot?

11:16.592 --> 11:19.553
Normally, you'd be correct, John,
but it, uh…

11:19.637 --> 11:21.263
Oh, it seems

11:21.847 --> 11:26.143
I've removed all their permission keys.

11:27.728 --> 11:29.563
Like you-- like you say,

11:30.356 --> 11:32.233
contingencies on contingencies.

11:34.735 --> 11:35.861
Which means…

11:37.655 --> 11:41.826
I'm the only one left alive on the planet
who can save everyone.

11:46.747 --> 11:49.834
<i>Jupiter 14 to command.</i>
<i>Surveillance cleared on resident 42.</i>

11:49.917 --> 11:52.878
<i>Move and report. Transferring</i>
<i>prisoner 001, Alistair</i> <i>Hastings,</i>

11:52.962 --> 11:54.714
<i>from holding to residence.</i>

11:54.797 --> 11:55.715
Danger.

12:03.222 --> 12:04.932
Make yourselves at home.

12:06.100 --> 12:07.059
Ah.

12:08.769 --> 12:10.312
Just like I remembered it.

12:10.396 --> 12:12.106
Phew!

12:12.732 --> 12:14.400
It's a bit dusty, but, uh…

12:15.943 --> 12:17.695
Can I get you anything to drink, John?

12:17.778 --> 12:20.740
The only thing I want from you
is access to the defense system.

12:20.823 --> 12:24.869
You know, I have to say
I have the utmost respect

12:24.952 --> 12:27.913
for the sacrifices you military men make.

12:27.997 --> 12:32.251
How you-- how you're always
ready for a fight. No fear.

12:34.044 --> 12:37.506
It's because of men like you that men
like me make a difference in the world.

12:37.590 --> 12:39.133
I don't fight for men like you.

12:39.216 --> 12:42.678
No, that's-- that's right.
No, you fight for your family now.

12:45.890 --> 12:47.141
Just give me the key.

12:50.144 --> 12:53.481
From what I hear, your family
just got a little more interesting.

12:54.648 --> 12:58.778
Grant Kelly, rising from the ashes.

13:11.916 --> 13:12.833
Stay here.

13:33.854 --> 13:34.772
Robot?

13:56.836 --> 13:57.920
Mr. Robinson?

14:09.640 --> 14:12.017
No. I'm sorry.

15:04.236 --> 15:05.404
We'll divide and conquer.

15:05.487 --> 15:08.824
I'll take a team of Chariots
and try and track and contain the robot.

15:08.908 --> 15:09.742
I'll stay back,

15:09.825 --> 15:12.328
try to get that defense system activated
some other way.

15:13.454 --> 15:16.373
Here, I found that in Hastings' hand.

15:16.457 --> 15:19.543
I think he pulled it out of his safe.
It might mean something.

15:19.627 --> 15:20.878
I'll look into it.

15:20.961 --> 15:21.962
You be careful.

15:22.504 --> 15:25.299
Anything changes,
even the weather, you call me.

15:29.637 --> 15:30.512
John.

15:31.889 --> 15:33.265
Something feels wrong.

15:34.642 --> 15:38.562
The fact that SAR isn't here yet.
What-- what's he waiting for?

15:38.646 --> 15:39.855
Maybe he's planning.

15:40.481 --> 15:42.232
We know the robots can learn.

15:42.733 --> 15:46.403
One thing's for sure.
They'll hit us differently this time.

15:47.613 --> 15:48.948
We just have to be ready.

15:53.118 --> 15:54.286
I got the alert.

15:55.454 --> 15:58.415
-What's goin' on?
-Grant. I'm glad you're here.

15:58.499 --> 16:01.085
-Where's Dad going?
-Did something happen with the robot?

16:01.168 --> 16:03.128
Girls, I need you
to listen to me for a second.

16:03.212 --> 16:05.547
All that time
that you spent with the robot,

16:05.631 --> 16:09.051
did you notice anything…
different about him?

16:09.134 --> 16:10.636
Wait, did he hurt someone?

16:10.719 --> 16:13.347
I know. It doesn't seem like
something he would do, but--

16:13.430 --> 16:14.515
Maybe it wasn't him.

16:14.598 --> 16:16.058
No, based on the injuries,

16:16.141 --> 16:17.393
-it was definitely--
-No, no, no.

16:17.476 --> 16:19.353
It's like what you said
happened on the Jupiter.

16:19.436 --> 16:21.522
Maybe it was him,
but he didn't know what he was doing.

16:21.605 --> 16:24.191
-What are you talking about?
-Okay, before we found you guys,

16:24.274 --> 16:26.527
for a few minutes, it's like
he was possessed by something.

16:26.610 --> 16:27.486
Possessed?

16:27.569 --> 16:30.656
Manipulated remotely, like a puppet.
Will thinks it was SAR.

16:30.739 --> 16:33.283
And-- and you didn't think to tell us?

16:33.367 --> 16:36.161
In all fairness to the girls, Maureen,
there was a lot going on.

16:36.245 --> 16:38.956
If anybody looks for the robot,
it should be someone he trusts. Will.

16:39.039 --> 16:41.834
Right! Well, that isn't really an option
right now, is it?

16:42.334 --> 16:44.586
-Okay. Come on, Penny. Let's go.

16:46.380 --> 16:48.257
Listen, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have--

16:49.008 --> 16:51.719
Welcome to the wonderful world
of parenting.

16:52.219 --> 16:53.846
I may be behind in that department,

16:53.929 --> 16:56.515
but there are areas
I can help you with if you need it.

16:56.598 --> 17:00.436
Mrs. Robinson. The procedure
was a success. Will's in recovery.

17:00.519 --> 17:03.022
He'll need to be for some time,
but you can see him now.

17:03.105 --> 17:03.981
Okay.

17:04.064 --> 17:06.817
Grant, I could use
a new set of eyes on this.

17:06.900 --> 17:08.235
Meet me at the Ops Center.

17:08.318 --> 17:09.278
Yeah.

17:17.661 --> 17:21.832
I have to admit, you surprised me, John.
You're always the one defending the robot.

17:22.332 --> 17:23.917
You said he was developing human traits.

17:25.878 --> 17:29.173
Being more human
isn't necessarily proof of humanity.

17:31.717 --> 17:34.553
To be honest, when the robot
was more like a machine,

17:34.636 --> 17:36.013
it was more dependable.

17:37.973 --> 17:40.893
Do you want me to drive so you can rest?
I'm sure it's been a while.

17:41.935 --> 17:45.272
I haven't had a rest in over a year.
What's one more day?

17:49.318 --> 17:50.611
I'm fine. Really.

17:53.072 --> 17:55.324
All right, spread into your search zones.

17:55.407 --> 17:58.786
The target is extremely dangerous.
Approach with caution.

17:59.995 --> 18:01.330
We need to find the robot.

18:01.413 --> 18:04.625
I mean, if SAR comes back, we need
something big and metal on our side.

18:04.708 --> 18:07.544
The point is
he might not be on our side anymore.

18:07.628 --> 18:09.463
Don't you think
it's worth finding out for sure?

18:10.172 --> 18:12.633
-If someone else gets there first--
-He'll defend himself.

18:12.716 --> 18:15.302
Exactly. We need to consider the fact

18:16.095 --> 18:18.555
that no one will buy my book
if it ends that way.

18:18.639 --> 18:19.640
Penny.

18:19.723 --> 18:23.685
I'm just saying, we only have one option.
We find the robot before Dad does.

18:23.769 --> 18:25.020
Well…

18:26.313 --> 18:27.731
…we're gonna need some help.

18:41.078 --> 18:41.954
Where…

18:43.288 --> 18:44.498
Where is everybody?

18:45.332 --> 18:46.375
Are-- are they okay?

18:46.458 --> 18:47.668
Everyone's fine.

18:48.252 --> 18:51.046
We're all here on Alpha Centauri.

18:54.007 --> 18:54.842
Robot?

18:56.260 --> 18:57.219
He's here too.

19:00.722 --> 19:01.807
We made it.

19:03.976 --> 19:05.811
SAR knows where to find us.

19:07.521 --> 19:10.232
He does, but we're working on that.

19:15.279 --> 19:16.113
Mom.

19:16.905 --> 19:19.825
I thought I could change him.
I thought that…

19:23.579 --> 19:26.123
I thought I could save everybody, but…

19:28.125 --> 19:29.209
I failed.

19:33.297 --> 19:34.381
Listen to me.

19:36.091 --> 19:37.718
You didn't fail.

19:39.344 --> 19:40.971
We are gonna figure it out.

19:43.182 --> 19:46.518
-How?
-Alpha Centauri has a defense system.

19:46.602 --> 19:48.937
We just need to find a way
how to turn it on.

19:49.021 --> 19:50.230
No one knows how?

19:50.314 --> 19:51.732
Well, Hastings, but he's…

19:53.525 --> 19:55.694
he's not talking right now.

19:55.777 --> 19:59.031
But I'm sure that there's
someone else here who will.

20:00.574 --> 20:05.370
Look, the most important thing
you can do right now is to rest, okay?

20:08.832 --> 20:10.042
Actually,

20:11.793 --> 20:14.004
there is something else I have to do.

20:27.142 --> 20:31.021
<i>Welcome home, Dr. Smith.</i>
<i>You've arrived at your destination.</i>

21:08.600 --> 21:10.602
You caused quite a stir back in town.

21:15.440 --> 21:17.067
Do you wanna talk about it?

21:20.570 --> 21:23.115
You've helped me before.
Maybe I can help you.

21:23.615 --> 21:26.368
'Cause I understand how it feels

21:27.160 --> 21:28.996
to desperately want to be good,

21:29.079 --> 21:31.373
but sometimes needing to be bad.

21:32.207 --> 21:35.002
I know what it is
to be backed into a corner

21:35.085 --> 21:38.839
and feel like the only way out
is to keep hurting everyone around you.

21:38.922 --> 21:42.175
Just please, uh… let-- let me help.

21:58.900 --> 22:02.279
Passport. Grocery. Trash. Laundry.

22:03.947 --> 22:05.866
It sounds like a list of chores.

22:07.117 --> 22:09.661
I'm pretty sure
you wouldn't keep that in a safe.

22:09.745 --> 22:12.456
For what it's worth,
I keep a lot of weird stuff in my safe.

22:13.582 --> 22:15.459
I don't doubt that, Sebastian.

22:15.542 --> 22:18.628
It must be some kind of access code.

22:21.298 --> 22:23.633
Read it to me, and-- and I'll enter it in.

22:23.717 --> 22:26.720
Typing them isn't going to work.
It's a VBAS.

22:27.346 --> 22:29.514
Voice Biometric Authentication System.

22:30.140 --> 22:33.727
-How-- how do you know that?
-Can I speak to you for a moment?

22:43.153 --> 22:45.113
What if I told you my mission 20 years ago

22:45.197 --> 22:47.491
wasn't an exploratory journey
to Alpha Centauri,

22:47.574 --> 22:49.451
-but to explore something else?

22:49.534 --> 22:51.703
-It wasn't anything shady like that.
-Right.

22:52.287 --> 22:54.289
Because secret government missions
are never shady.

22:54.373 --> 22:56.958
It started with a small group
of scientists at NASA

22:57.042 --> 22:58.627
who discovered a rift in space

22:59.336 --> 23:02.089
opening and closing,
just like the one you've seen made by--

23:02.172 --> 23:03.173
The alien engines.

23:03.256 --> 23:05.300
But back then, we had no idea what it was.

23:05.384 --> 23:08.553
And since the unknown
tends to scare the crap out of civilians,

23:08.637 --> 23:13.642
we needed a cover story to hide the truth,
which was that the crew of the Fortuna

23:13.725 --> 23:16.895
was being sent to find
what was on the other side of that rift.

23:17.396 --> 23:20.732
Where it went to,
what was causing it, or who.

23:20.816 --> 23:24.736
And that's why the flight data
was scrubbed from your hard drives.

23:24.820 --> 23:27.989
No one could know what we were doing.
Not even mission control.

23:28.073 --> 23:31.868
So our communication was always coded
and encrypted by a VBAS,

23:31.952 --> 23:35.747
a series of words read aloud
that granted access to a private server.

23:35.831 --> 23:38.375
So… what you're saying

23:38.458 --> 23:41.420
is the only way to activate
Alpha Centauri's defense system

23:41.503 --> 23:45.507
is… is with the voice of a man
who is no longer breathing,

23:45.590 --> 23:46.716
let alone speaking?

23:47.676 --> 23:48.552
Yeah.

23:49.845 --> 23:52.597
No. Absolutely not.

23:52.681 --> 23:56.977
I am an officer now, and I am not engaging
in this type of illicit behavior.

23:57.060 --> 23:58.645
Well, if Robot's hiding out,

23:58.728 --> 24:02.232
we figure who better to help us
than someone who's, you know, had to hide

24:02.315 --> 24:03.900
-a couple of things of their own?
-Mmm.

24:03.984 --> 24:04.860
Oh!

24:04.943 --> 24:08.029
So now that you need a smuggler,
there's no judgment?

24:08.113 --> 24:11.741
I say we begin
with a public apology to me.

24:12.242 --> 24:14.744
Maybe a proclamation?
Read from one of those scrolls?

24:14.828 --> 24:16.371
-From the Renaissance?
-Fine. Don't come.

24:17.581 --> 24:21.001
I'm just saying, when everybody finds out
you knew what we were doing

24:21.084 --> 24:23.044
and you let us go out alone…

24:25.797 --> 24:27.799
Okay! Okay.

24:29.801 --> 24:30.760
Here's the deal.

24:30.844 --> 24:34.973
If you were looking to hide something
like, say, a case of booze,

24:35.056 --> 24:39.352
or single-use plastics, or certain oils
that are not just for cooking…

24:39.436 --> 24:40.645
…you know…

24:40.729 --> 24:42.397
there's about a trillion places,

24:42.481 --> 24:45.984
but there's only
a few places within 20 miles

24:46.067 --> 24:50.614
where you can
successfully hide a seven-foot robot.

24:50.697 --> 24:52.532
-Okay--

24:54.159 --> 24:54.993
Who's there?

24:55.619 --> 24:58.288
Whatever you think you just heard,
we were just kidding.

24:58.371 --> 25:02.501
We would never do something so… dangerous
and clearly against the rules.

25:05.670 --> 25:08.590
Look, I'm not trying to eavesdrop
or anything. I was just…

25:10.842 --> 25:11.843
Just what?

25:13.637 --> 25:16.389
If it's true
about SAR knowing where we are,

25:16.473 --> 25:20.018
then I thought that we should talk,
in case this is the last time.

25:20.519 --> 25:22.562
Oh man, I know where this is going.

25:23.146 --> 25:26.024
Look, Vijay,
we don't really have time to talk.

25:26.107 --> 25:29.736
-We just need to find the robot.
-Yeah, I heard. It sounds dangerous.

25:29.819 --> 25:32.280
It's fine. Danger's my middle name.

25:32.948 --> 25:36.535
-That's not true. It's Cornelius.
-I just don't want anyone to get hurt.

25:36.618 --> 25:37.619
Yeah.

25:37.702 --> 25:40.789
Last time we did something dangerous,
weren't you the one who got hurt?

25:41.331 --> 25:42.791
Okay, look, the point is, uh…

25:43.542 --> 25:47.045
If you… if you're doing this,
I'm going with you.

25:47.128 --> 25:48.463
All right, let's go.

25:48.547 --> 25:49.548
Wait, what?

25:50.423 --> 25:51.466
Hmm!

25:52.884 --> 25:55.178
Oh man. If my dad finds out,
he's gonna kill me.

25:55.262 --> 25:57.138
Yep. Welcome to the club.

25:58.390 --> 26:00.350
What happens if the robot resists capture?

26:01.935 --> 26:05.605
We both know, when we're protecting
our families, we can do things we regret.

26:05.689 --> 26:08.066
Let's cross that bridge
when there's a bridge.

26:10.860 --> 26:12.445
Do you remember right after we met,

26:13.405 --> 26:16.366
I tried to take that Jupiter
from that dying planet

26:16.449 --> 26:17.784
with my family alone?

26:19.369 --> 26:21.371
Thought it was the right thing to do, but…

26:23.999 --> 26:26.418
Your forgiveness
allowed me to make amends, John.

26:28.044 --> 26:30.797
And I could come back
and stand by your side and fight,

26:30.880 --> 26:32.299
as I've done ever since.

26:34.092 --> 26:36.177
-It's human to make mistakes.

26:36.261 --> 26:37.887
It's human to lose control.

26:38.972 --> 26:42.517
The most human thing
you can do… is forgive.

26:44.811 --> 26:46.646
You think I should forgive the robot?

26:46.730 --> 26:49.482
No. I think you should forgive yourself.

26:50.650 --> 26:53.194
When your son walks into danger

26:53.278 --> 26:55.864
under your nose,
because you took your eye off the ball--

26:55.947 --> 26:58.867
They survived a year
on their own without you or me.

26:58.950 --> 27:01.119
-They're not kids anymore.
-They should be!

27:04.789 --> 27:06.708
We've taken their childhood
away from them.

27:11.338 --> 27:12.422
That's him.

27:12.505 --> 27:14.924
He's at the top of the dam.
What's he doing up there?

27:15.008 --> 27:17.927
Look! It's Robot.
If we can see his light, so can Dad.

27:18.011 --> 27:20.138
But those other Chariots
have a big head start.

27:20.221 --> 27:22.307
-We'll never make it in time.

27:22.390 --> 27:23.725
What are you doing?

27:23.808 --> 27:26.353
The road to drive up is long and windy.

27:26.436 --> 27:28.647
If we go by foot, we can beat them there.

27:28.730 --> 27:31.066
I'm sorry.
It sounded like you said on foot.

27:32.901 --> 27:35.487
-The dam is just beyond those trees.

27:35.570 --> 27:37.572
The fastest way for us to get to the top

27:37.656 --> 27:39.908
is to take the elevator inside
straight up.

27:39.991 --> 27:42.243
How are we supposed
to get inside the dam?

27:42.327 --> 27:44.329
You have something
that nobody else does.

27:44.412 --> 27:46.331
-What's that?
-Don West.

27:46.873 --> 27:48.416
-Oh!

27:56.675 --> 27:57.634
Hi.

27:58.343 --> 28:00.512
I'm Amanda Adler. The--

28:00.595 --> 28:04.307
These are my boys, Willem and Henry.
You asked to see us?

28:04.391 --> 28:06.184
Yes. Yes.

28:06.768 --> 28:08.770
Uh… Sorry. Hi.

28:09.646 --> 28:11.439
-Um…

28:11.523 --> 28:14.109
You… don't know who I am,

28:14.192 --> 28:16.027
but my name's--

28:16.111 --> 28:20.532
Will Robinson. We've heard the stories
about you from some of the other kids.

28:20.615 --> 28:21.700
Ah.

28:23.034 --> 28:25.203
Well, there's…

28:27.163 --> 28:29.874
there's one story you haven't heard yet.

28:30.500 --> 28:31.418
One that…

28:32.711 --> 28:34.796
I promised your dad I'd tell you one day.

28:35.463 --> 28:36.673
You knew our dad?

28:37.173 --> 28:39.259
Yeah. Yeah, I did.

28:42.095 --> 28:43.054
And…

28:44.639 --> 28:48.518
I'm guessing you guys have heard of me

28:48.601 --> 28:51.229
because I'm friends with a robot, right?

28:52.564 --> 28:55.191
Well, something that
not a lot of people know

28:55.900 --> 28:59.404
is that your dad had a robot friend too.

29:02.657 --> 29:03.992
His name was Scarecrow,

29:05.368 --> 29:07.328
and it's because of what your dad did

29:07.912 --> 29:12.041
that Scarecrow was able to help
all the kids of the 24th Colonist Group

29:12.125 --> 29:13.334
get away safely.

29:14.043 --> 29:15.336
Your dad's a hero.

29:16.629 --> 29:17.630
To all of us.

29:19.424 --> 29:20.467
Thank you.

29:23.094 --> 29:24.095
Come on.

29:24.679 --> 29:26.514
We should let Mr. Robinson recover.

29:26.598 --> 29:27.682
Okay.

29:33.980 --> 29:36.483
With everything that's happening
right now,

29:38.610 --> 29:39.903
I wish he was still here.

29:41.154 --> 29:43.573
Sounds like we could use
a few more heroes.

30:08.223 --> 30:10.183
-Mom?
-<i>Yes, Will?</i>

30:10.266 --> 30:12.727
Mom, I think there's someone
you need to talk to.

30:16.523 --> 30:18.274
I-- I don't understand.

30:19.067 --> 30:22.153
Why do you think Ben would have access
to this defense system?

30:22.862 --> 30:27.826
Alistair Hastings, uh, said
that he was the only person left alive

30:27.909 --> 30:28.993
who could save us.

30:29.077 --> 30:33.540
And I believe that the other person
he was talking about was your husband.

30:34.040 --> 30:36.292
I never heard Ben
read the words on this list.

30:36.376 --> 30:39.671
Maybe not all together,
or-- or in that order,

30:39.754 --> 30:42.757
but I'm sure he said each of them
at some point.

30:44.008 --> 30:47.595
We just need to find them.
Old voice mails, uh, home videos, or--

30:47.679 --> 30:50.265
I see. I'll go see what I can find.

30:53.434 --> 30:55.436
<i>Think it's weird for Mom,</i>
<i>having Grant back?</i>

30:56.229 --> 30:58.773
Um… Not any weirder than it is for me.

30:59.691 --> 31:03.069
I'm just saying I know what it feels like
to be around someone you used to like

31:03.152 --> 31:04.904
and then someone you currently like.

31:04.988 --> 31:07.282
Oh, so this conversation's
actually about you?

31:07.866 --> 31:09.784
What are you doing
walking back here with me?

31:10.285 --> 31:11.452
What do you mean?

31:11.536 --> 31:15.331
Well, let's face it, the robot isn't
the only thing you're looking for here.

31:15.415 --> 31:17.750
If I had to choose
between a girl I was crazy about

31:17.834 --> 31:21.087
-and a guy who hasn't showered in days--
-Maybe Penny and I are better as friends.

31:21.170 --> 31:24.674
Listen,
if there's something I've learned,

31:24.757 --> 31:27.594
it's that relationships
are a lot like smuggling.

31:28.094 --> 31:29.846
First, find out what the person wants.

31:29.929 --> 31:32.390
Then you have to decide
if you know how to get it for them.

31:35.435 --> 31:36.895
Okay, we're here.

31:38.521 --> 31:40.273
But how do we get inside?

31:40.356 --> 31:41.649
Leave that to me.

32:09.218 --> 32:11.638
-No peeking.
-How do you have the code to the dam?

32:11.763 --> 32:12.805
-I do not.

32:12.889 --> 32:15.975
But I do have the code
to this really, really big wine cellar.

32:23.733 --> 32:26.194
So you store booze in a dam?

32:26.736 --> 32:30.615
That's right. And if we survive today
and I catch you or your underage friends

32:30.698 --> 32:32.408
trying to break in and party,

32:32.492 --> 32:34.160
-I'll whoop your ass.

32:39.624 --> 32:42.835
<i>I am sorry to be leaving you</i>
<i>and the boys again, but, um…</i>

32:43.336 --> 32:46.506
<i>try and save their school projects</i>
<i>so I can see them when I get home.</i>

32:46.589 --> 32:49.008
-There, "home." You got that?
<i>-I love you.</i>

32:49.092 --> 32:51.302
-Yeah, two more to go.

32:51.386 --> 32:54.681
That's the last voice mail.
Let's see what they have on video.

32:58.893 --> 32:59.978
<i>Willem, come here.</i>

33:00.061 --> 33:01.813
<i>Okay. Shh!</i>

33:01.896 --> 33:04.607
<i>-We're gonna scare Dad.</i>

33:05.692 --> 33:09.612
<i>Oh, you two think you can sneak up on me?</i>
<i>Really? Right. Come here.</i>

33:14.283 --> 33:15.410
So…

33:16.703 --> 33:18.496
how come you didn't tell me about Judy?

33:19.247 --> 33:20.206
Uh…

33:24.252 --> 33:25.253
I tried.

33:26.045 --> 33:29.841
I tried, but NASA, uh…

33:30.341 --> 33:34.053
They said it would be a cruel distraction

33:35.013 --> 33:38.641
to tell somebody who couldn't return
for what might be, you know, decades.

33:38.725 --> 33:42.311
The Maureen I remember would have found
a way around the rules if she wanted to.

33:43.521 --> 33:48.192
Come on. You were… barely interested
in a committed relationship,

33:48.776 --> 33:49.986
much less a family.

33:50.653 --> 33:52.196
What would it have changed?

33:54.615 --> 33:56.492
All that, for you, was 20 years ago.

33:57.493 --> 33:59.203
For me, it was yesterday.

33:59.287 --> 34:00.621
Go to sleep a boy.

34:01.622 --> 34:04.459
Wake up… a man.

34:06.753 --> 34:10.506
Only took a year for me to feel like
Will did the same thing.

34:14.010 --> 34:17.305
You've done an incredible job, Maureen,
with all your kids.

34:18.639 --> 34:20.141
I didn't do it on my own.

34:21.142 --> 34:24.103
Your mom was always there for Judy.

34:25.688 --> 34:27.148
-And, of course--
-John.

34:29.901 --> 34:31.277
Seems like a good man.

34:31.986 --> 34:32.904
He is.

34:34.280 --> 34:36.491
Oh, we've had our ups and downs, but…

34:38.576 --> 34:42.622
I think it takes getting lost…
to find out what you have.

34:44.457 --> 34:45.291
<i>Are we lost?</i>

34:45.374 --> 34:48.086
Nope, here it is.
It should take us to the top.

34:49.045 --> 34:50.797
-Whoa.

34:51.589 --> 34:52.548
Is this safe?

34:53.424 --> 34:55.551
Well, if it's not,
I'm gonna take care of you.

35:01.099 --> 35:04.852
Okay, plan is, when we see the robot,
we approach him together.

35:04.936 --> 35:07.188
-But Penny should talk to him.
-What? Why me?

35:07.271 --> 35:09.107
After Will,
you've spent the most time together.

35:09.190 --> 35:11.651
I've spent my whole life with you.
You don't listen to me.

35:13.861 --> 35:15.655
-Oh!
-Why is it stopping?

35:16.823 --> 35:18.324
We're not at the top yet.

35:18.407 --> 35:20.743
I don't know.
The gears are still grinding.

35:20.827 --> 35:22.787
-It's gotta be stuck on something.

35:22.870 --> 35:23.913
Come on!

35:34.966 --> 35:36.384
No. Mm-mm.

35:38.010 --> 35:40.680
Wait, Will's robot
doesn't make these kind of marks.

35:40.763 --> 35:42.306
-Oh! Shh, shh!

35:42.390 --> 35:44.058
-You hear that?

35:46.352 --> 35:48.563
That sounds like
more than one robot.

35:48.646 --> 35:49.564
Yeah.

35:51.607 --> 35:53.734
They haven't been waiting to attack.

35:54.610 --> 35:55.862
They're already here.

35:58.739 --> 35:59.740
Mom, Dad.

36:00.867 --> 36:02.660
-No, it's not gonna work.
-Mom? Mom--

36:02.743 --> 36:04.787
The walls are too thick.
It's blocking the signal.

36:04.871 --> 36:05.997
So what do we do?

36:06.622 --> 36:10.168
Look, we're the only ones who know
what's really going on here.

36:11.961 --> 36:12.920
Penny.

36:13.004 --> 36:14.422
What's really going on here?

36:15.965 --> 36:18.843
Well, clearly, these robots are saboteurs.

36:18.926 --> 36:21.470
Whatever defense system
your mom's trying to get up and running,

36:21.554 --> 36:24.223
it needs all the power
from this dam to do it.

36:24.307 --> 36:27.185
We don't have time to warn them.
We need to stop the robots now.

36:27.268 --> 36:28.436
What are you talking--

36:28.519 --> 36:30.354
Wait, Judy! Stop!

36:30.938 --> 36:33.733
Sebastian. We need your workplace.

36:34.859 --> 36:35.693
What?

36:36.194 --> 36:37.445
Why? What?

36:38.404 --> 36:41.449
Whoa! You gotta scan that for malware
before you plug it in--

36:41.532 --> 36:42.909
She just plugged it in.

36:42.992 --> 36:43.951
Okay.

36:45.077 --> 36:46.787
-Here we go.

36:47.496 --> 36:48.831
<i>Passport.</i>

36:49.540 --> 36:50.750
<i>Groceries.</i>

36:51.626 --> 36:52.543
<i>Trash.</i>

36:53.920 --> 36:54.837

36:55.922 --> 36:56.797

36:57.840 --> 36:58.716

<i>Home.</i>

37:42.426 --> 37:44.428
<i>Defense system online.</i>

37:44.929 --> 37:46.973
-We did it.
-<i>Administrator mode activated.</i>

37:47.056 --> 37:49.267
-We're good!

38:24.885 --> 38:27.471
-They're taking out the turbines.
-Oh crap.

38:28.723 --> 38:30.641
Hey. What are you looking for?

38:30.725 --> 38:33.394
A fair fight. Right now we don't have one.

38:33.477 --> 38:36.605
I'm also okay with not fighting.
It's another way we could go.

38:36.689 --> 38:39.358
Okay. Okay. Here's the plan.

38:39.442 --> 38:41.777
Those turbines
have something called a governor.

38:41.861 --> 38:44.405
It controls the speed of the blades
as the water runs through them,

38:44.488 --> 38:46.282
generating power for the settlement.

38:46.365 --> 38:48.451
When the governor fails,
the blades spin too fast,

38:48.534 --> 38:50.494
causing the turbines to explode,

38:50.578 --> 38:54.040
which should be bad for any robots that
happen to be standing on it at the time.

38:54.123 --> 38:55.291
Let me get this straight.

38:55.374 --> 39:00.379
You wanna stop the robots from destroying
the turbine by… destroying the turbine?

39:00.463 --> 39:02.006
There's three turbines out there.

39:02.089 --> 39:04.800
I'm pretty sure whatever defense system
your parents are working on

39:04.884 --> 39:06.594
-can be powered by two.
-"Pretty sure"?

39:07.928 --> 39:08.763
Mostly sure.

39:08.846 --> 39:12.308
Look, if we do nothing,
then just roll out the red carpet,

39:12.391 --> 39:14.352
because it's the premiere of
<i>SAR Kills Everybody</i>

39:14.435 --> 39:16.187
-starring our corpses.
-Uh… Excuse me.

39:16.270 --> 39:19.273
The governor thing you're talking about,
it's underneath the turbines.

39:19.357 --> 39:20.733
-Yeah.
-Underwater.

39:20.816 --> 39:21.984
Yeah.

39:22.068 --> 39:24.153
It's way down there.
We'd have to swim pretty deep.

39:25.154 --> 39:26.072
Not we.

39:27.114 --> 39:28.032
Me.

39:29.116 --> 39:32.036
Let this be a lesson to you kids.
Always wear underwear.

39:32.119 --> 39:34.163
-No, Don, I'm doing it.
-No, stop. Judy.

39:34.246 --> 39:35.915
-I can handle this.
-Are you sure?

39:35.998 --> 39:38.417
Have you checked the test results lately?
'Cause I have.

39:38.501 --> 39:40.086
Breath control, lung capacity.

39:40.169 --> 39:43.005
I'm the only one here qualified to do it,
and you know that.

39:43.089 --> 39:46.467
Besides, I've… done
something like this before.

39:46.550 --> 39:49.220
No. You almost died
doing something like this before.

39:49.303 --> 39:52.765
And you did it to protect Will.
You're allowed to risk death for family.

39:52.848 --> 39:54.183
-Don?
-What?

39:56.102 --> 39:57.144
What do you think you are?

40:04.318 --> 40:05.152
Judy.

40:06.070 --> 40:07.196
I'll be right back.

40:07.947 --> 40:09.031
Judy!

40:11.325 --> 40:12.243
Judy!

40:29.176 --> 40:30.094
John.

40:34.807 --> 40:35.641
No.

40:36.892 --> 40:38.477
Judy.

40:38.561 --> 40:40.938
Call Maureen.
Tell her what we're up against.

40:41.021 --> 40:43.190
-What are you gonna do?
-Help my daughter!

41:02.543 --> 41:04.211
Come on, Judy. You gotta move.

41:04.295 --> 41:06.464
-Vic-- Victor?

41:07.173 --> 41:08.757
Slow down. I can't hear you.

41:08.841 --> 41:11.469
-Whoa, whoa, whoa. Mrs. Robinson!

41:11.552 --> 41:15.389
<i>-Turbine one operation ratio at 50%.</i>
-You should take a look at this!

41:36.118 --> 41:38.829
Don, look! We have to do something.

41:38.913 --> 41:40.664
-It's you!

41:42.541 --> 41:44.168
Help family.

41:44.919 --> 41:48.797
We got a problem. Two turbines redlining.
Third, working overtime to carry the load.

41:48.881 --> 41:51.175
-How long will it hold?
-Powering the entire defense system?

41:51.258 --> 41:52.301
Hard to tell.

41:52.384 --> 41:54.678
John, come in. Can you hear me? John?

41:55.554 --> 41:56.972
-Penny!
-Dad!

41:57.056 --> 41:58.766
-Stay here!
-Dad!

41:58.849 --> 42:01.977
Hey! Jude! Come on! Come!

42:02.603 --> 42:04.188
No, no. Get back! Back inside!

42:44.853 --> 42:45.938
Hey, let's be careful.

42:46.021 --> 42:49.149
It's okay, John. It was one of
the other robots who got to Hastings.

42:49.233 --> 42:52.403
It's like they were trying to frame him
and keep us apart.

42:52.486 --> 42:55.239
And it almost worked,
but he saved everyone, Dad.

42:56.073 --> 42:57.199
He stopped the robots.

43:04.498 --> 43:06.417
Was that all of them that were here?

43:07.585 --> 43:09.712
Yes, John Robinson.

43:21.807 --> 43:24.893
-So, are you glad you came?
-Honestly, not really.

43:25.644 --> 43:27.438
Oh. Because we almost died?

43:30.107 --> 43:32.318
No, um… because…

43:35.362 --> 43:37.781
I'm not a smuggler, Penny.

43:39.491 --> 43:40.326
Okay.

43:40.409 --> 43:43.245
I don't think I can give you what you want
or be what you want.

43:45.539 --> 43:49.376
Look, I'm not someone who does everything
right and says everything right, and…

43:49.460 --> 43:51.378
who has an awesome story
for every occasion

43:51.462 --> 43:55.466
and can somehow wear a man-bun
and not look like an idiot.

43:58.552 --> 44:00.387
Look,
I know that this is stupid, okay,

44:01.889 --> 44:03.057
because we're just friends.

44:03.140 --> 44:06.310
And I… tried for a year
to be okay with that,

44:06.393 --> 44:09.563
but it's… it's really hard…

44:12.483 --> 44:17.112
because I think that…
you are amazing and strange and…

44:18.072 --> 44:21.742
rude and smart and unique.

44:23.035 --> 44:24.203
And honestly frustrating

44:24.286 --> 44:28.290
because you're so much more special
than you give yourself credit for.

44:33.671 --> 44:34.630
Okay.

44:34.713 --> 44:37.424
Look, my point is
you don't have to want to be with me.

44:39.551 --> 44:41.845
And that makes sense
now that I listen to myself,

44:41.929 --> 44:44.181
but it's crazy
that you wanna be with Liam.

44:45.557 --> 44:47.935
You don't need someone
who always has to be the hero.

44:48.018 --> 44:50.145
<i>You're</i> the hero, Penny.

44:51.939 --> 44:54.400
And I think it's a shame
you haven't figured that out yet.

44:55.609 --> 44:56.527
Uh…

44:57.152 --> 44:58.278
Wow.

44:58.362 --> 44:59.238
Um…

44:59.863 --> 45:03.784
Thank you, but I am not the person
that you think I am.

45:05.953 --> 45:07.955
You know, I wish I was, but I'm not.

45:09.164 --> 45:10.833
Um… you know, I just…

45:11.500 --> 45:15.295
I just don't want you to be disappointed
when you realize it too.

45:19.508 --> 45:21.051
Hey, promise me something.

45:22.094 --> 45:22.970
What?

45:23.721 --> 45:25.723
When you realize that I was right,

45:27.057 --> 45:28.684
then I get to say, "I told you so."

45:31.145 --> 45:32.896
Never in a million years.

45:54.918 --> 45:58.505
<i>ID chip scanned.</i>

<i>Work or home?</i>

Work.

46:23.655 --> 46:27.785
Okay, John, just be careful
and get back here as soon as you can.

46:27.868 --> 46:30.162
We'll keep our eyes on the sky
just in case.

46:32.247 --> 46:35.918
Okay, Sebastian, talk to me.
How are we holding up?

46:36.001 --> 46:37.836
Touch and go. It's tickling the red line.

46:37.920 --> 46:41.590
I'm trying to pull from solar and wind,
but we need that third turbine to hold on.

46:41.673 --> 46:44.843
Shut down everything else
in the settlement if you have to.

46:44.927 --> 46:46.720
We have to keep
the defense shield operational.

46:50.390 --> 46:52.810
Sebastian,
please tell me that was you.

46:53.685 --> 46:54.853
It wasn't me.

46:55.521 --> 46:56.563
Third turbine is down.

47:05.489 --> 47:07.658
<i>Backup generator online.</i>

47:12.496 --> 47:13.580
Oh no.

47:16.250 --> 47:17.709

47:22.214 --> 47:23.715
We're detecting an energy spike

47:23.799 --> 47:25.717
a few thousand miles
outside the atmosphere.

47:26.218 --> 47:27.970
