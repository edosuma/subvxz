WEBVTT

00:00.014 --> 00:02.182
- Please don't tell me we're witches.
- We're witches.

00:02.210 --> 00:04.445
You have an enemy, Joanna,
and they're not gonna stop

00:04.478 --> 00:06.224
<i>until you
and your girls are dead.</i>

00:07.342 --> 00:11.302
- WENDY: The imposter... she stabbed me.
- I know who killed my husband.

00:11.303 --> 00:13.371
You are under arrest
for the murder of Bill Thatcher.

00:13.372 --> 00:14.879
Wait. Adam,
what the hell?!

00:14.913 --> 00:17.217
- Wendy?
- Ingrid, what were you thinking?

00:17.240 --> 00:20.285
You resurrect someone you love,
then someone you love has to die.

00:20.286 --> 00:23.995
INGRID: <i>Do you realize you were almost
burned alive and drowned all in one night?</i>

00:24.037 --> 00:26.154
Why was Mom arrested
for murder?

00:26.205 --> 00:28.073
The shape-shifter
that has it out for your mom

00:28.107 --> 00:31.426
<i>has taken your mom's form, killed Bill
Thatcher, leaving Maura as a witness.</i>

00:31.427 --> 00:33.857
- You have a brother?
- DASH: Yeah. I told you I had a brother.

00:33.875 --> 00:36.394
- I don't think you should be here.
- Definitely shouldn't be here.

00:36.395 --> 00:37.695
You're gonna need it
for when you leave town.

00:37.696 --> 00:38.887
Think I'll stay a while.

00:38.888 --> 00:41.291
Have you ever seen me
run away from a fight?

00:41.292 --> 00:45.287
We'll find the shifter, and we'll keep
the girls alive as long as we can.

01:21.406 --> 01:23.457
(gasps loudly) Oh.

01:23.508 --> 01:26.293
Killian. Thank God.

01:26.298 --> 01:28.799
(sighs)

01:31.875 --> 01:34.652
Wendy? What are
you doing up?

01:34.653 --> 01:35.910
(sighs)

01:35.911 --> 01:38.556
Tarot cards like to be read
in the middle of the night,

01:38.557 --> 01:40.511
and I need them
to cooperate.

01:40.512 --> 01:44.449
I'm trying to find out who's gonna die
because of the curse that you unleashed.

01:44.585 --> 01:47.306
I thought you said
it wasn't possible to know.

01:47.307 --> 01:49.744
I did say that, didn't I?

01:49.745 --> 01:53.347
But you can't always believe
everything that I tell you.

01:54.673 --> 01:56.841
(gasps)

02:02.122 --> 02:04.840
(sighs)

02:06.126 --> 02:07.943
Oh.

02:16.195 --> 02:18.034
No...

02:18.870 --> 02:20.571
(sighs)

02:26.481 --> 02:29.845
- This can't be right.
- Who is it?

02:30.343 --> 02:31.977
Is it Mom...?

02:33.198 --> 02:35.533
Is it Freya?

02:36.105 --> 02:38.507
Oh, God, is it you...?

02:38.746 --> 02:41.639
According to these cards,
the person who's going to die...

02:42.312 --> 02:43.829
Is you.

02:43.863 --> 02:45.164
What?

02:45.198 --> 02:46.916
(whimpering)

02:48.184 --> 02:52.031
You have no idea how to actually get
to the kitchen from here, do you?

02:52.032 --> 02:54.814
Not really. This is why
I like living on a boat.

02:54.815 --> 02:57.564
It's impossible to get
lost going to the kitchen.

02:58.773 --> 03:00.207
(gasps)

03:06.937 --> 03:09.104
Mmm.

03:10.551 --> 03:12.468
Mmm. (footsteps
approaching)

03:12.469 --> 03:14.220
DASH:
Freya?

03:15.152 --> 03:17.766
- What the hell's going on?
- Dash.

03:18.883 --> 03:20.518
Wait!

03:21.007 --> 03:22.557
Dash?

03:22.789 --> 03:24.155
Help me...

03:24.156 --> 03:28.041
WENDY: I'm sorry, Ingrid, but
the truth is, you deserve this.

03:28.042 --> 03:30.127
This is all your fault.

03:30.128 --> 03:32.179
(whimpering)

03:32.180 --> 03:33.855
Dash?

03:33.957 --> 03:36.981
(sighs, panting)

03:51.047 --> 03:54.433
WOMAN (raspy):
Joanna?

03:55.503 --> 03:57.537
(guttural gasping)

03:58.402 --> 04:00.320
(groans, gasping)

04:00.510 --> 04:03.512
(guttural gasping)

04:03.726 --> 04:06.328
(gasps loudly)

04:06.363 --> 04:08.864
(sighs)

04:13.549 --> 04:16.651
(gasps)

04:17.908 --> 04:19.555
(sighs)

04:19.926 --> 04:21.125
(panting)

04:21.177 --> 04:23.045
(sighs)

04:23.079 --> 04:26.298
(gasps, sighs)

04:29.636 --> 04:31.186
(sighs)

04:32.296 --> 04:34.979
Season 1, Episode 3
"Today I Am a Witch"

04:35.101 --> 04:38.101
Sync & corrections: Reef
www.addic7ed.com

04:38.389 --> 04:42.053
- Can't sleep?
- Bad dream. You?

04:42.054 --> 04:43.989
I'm just looking
through some old spells,

04:44.023 --> 04:46.358
trying to find inspiration
for our shifter problem.

04:46.392 --> 04:48.107
- Any luck?
- Let me guess...

04:48.108 --> 04:50.263
You're worried about the price
for the resurrection spell.

04:50.264 --> 04:53.466
Maybe we could find a way
to reverse it so no one has to die.

04:53.467 --> 04:56.583
Ingrid, honey, we've gone over this.
There's nothing we can do.

04:56.584 --> 04:58.906
Balance has to be restored.
We can't change that.

04:58.907 --> 05:01.958
But I can't just sit around
waiting for someone I love to die

05:01.959 --> 05:03.745
because of my stupid mistake.

05:03.746 --> 05:05.479
You don't have
to just sit around.

05:05.480 --> 05:08.490
Let me teach you. There's still
so much for you to learn.

05:08.491 --> 05:11.660
I don't want to learn
anything else about magic.

05:11.661 --> 05:13.579
Don't be so sure about that.

05:16.605 --> 05:19.058
Magic is what
you make of it.

05:19.059 --> 05:23.356
It can be dangerous and deadly,
or it can be mystical and beautiful.

05:23.813 --> 05:26.097
It's up to you.

05:27.283 --> 05:28.933
(door opening)

05:29.614 --> 05:31.046
Huh.

05:32.837 --> 05:34.537
Am I missing something?

05:34.538 --> 05:36.466
- Nope.
- What are you doing here?

05:36.492 --> 05:39.741
Shouldn't you be at Fair Haven
with your dashing fiancÃ©?

05:39.764 --> 05:42.968
I can't sleep. Every night,
it's the same thing.

05:42.969 --> 05:45.712
I have the hottest, most
incredible sex with Killian.

05:45.713 --> 05:46.849
- Nice.
- What?!

05:46.850 --> 05:48.267
In my dreams.
Only in my dreams.

05:48.268 --> 05:50.419
In real life, I have that kind
of sex with Dash.

05:50.420 --> 05:52.198
Yes, we know.
We all know.

05:52.199 --> 05:54.412
Every time he sleeps over, like,
three, four times a night.

05:54.413 --> 05:56.480
- Really? Four times? Oh...
- Mm-hmm.

05:56.481 --> 05:59.612
The point is, it's not like there's
a problem with me and Dash,

05:59.613 --> 06:01.838
but I can't make
these Killian dreams stop.

06:01.901 --> 06:04.135
It's like, I feel guilty,
like I'm cheating,

06:04.153 --> 06:05.904
and I'm not even doing anything.

06:05.938 --> 06:07.767
I need to get him
out of my head.

06:07.768 --> 06:10.587
I'm a witch now. How hard can it
be to control my own thoughts?

06:10.616 --> 06:12.250
- Very hard.
- Very hard.

06:13.096 --> 06:14.704
Look, girls, take it easy.

06:14.705 --> 06:17.315
You can't master the art
of witchcraft in a week.

06:17.316 --> 06:18.974
But don't worry.
It'll take time,

06:18.975 --> 06:21.018
but I can teach you
everything you need to know.

06:21.019 --> 06:23.121
Let me be your Mr. Miyagi.

06:23.122 --> 06:24.997
Just, please
don't tell your mother.

06:24.998 --> 06:26.596
Please don't tell your mother
what?

06:26.597 --> 06:28.561
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

06:28.562 --> 06:30.820
Hey, I don't want
the girls doing magic.

06:30.821 --> 06:33.145
- It's too dangerous.
- Okay.

06:33.146 --> 06:35.079
We're not kids in
pigtails anymore.

06:35.080 --> 06:37.056
We're adults who can
make our own decisions.

06:37.057 --> 06:38.825
Ooh, I miss the pigtails.

06:38.826 --> 06:40.360
I do, I do.

06:40.374 --> 06:43.041
Oh, it's not
about grown-up or not.

06:43.042 --> 06:45.364
I've just... I've been alive
a lot longer than you.

06:45.365 --> 06:48.077
I know things you don't.
It's for your own good.

06:48.078 --> 06:50.925
But maybe we could help you
with the shape-shifter.

06:51.067 --> 06:53.735
There is no shape-shifter
anymore.

06:53.736 --> 06:55.353
Everything is under control.

06:55.354 --> 06:57.394
I took care of it
with a banishing spell.

06:57.395 --> 07:00.564
Whoever it is, they can't
come anywhere near us.

07:00.733 --> 07:03.541
And I don't think we want
any temptation around.

07:03.542 --> 07:06.193
Right? Now, well,
just to be safe.

07:06.249 --> 07:07.763
(gasping)

07:07.764 --> 07:09.537
- What are you doing?!
- What the hell?!

07:09.540 --> 07:10.873
That's an heirloom.

07:12.254 --> 07:14.706
- Now it's ash.
- Wha...?

07:14.724 --> 07:16.441
Good night.

07:23.970 --> 07:26.171
What the hell
happened here?

07:28.549 --> 07:31.685
What a minute. I've seen that
symbol before. <i>Malus Amplio?</i>

07:31.719 --> 07:35.823
It draws in dark energy,
and magnifies the power of evil.

07:35.824 --> 07:38.834
It was in the ground where
Bill Thatcher was killed,

07:38.835 --> 07:40.786
in my dream last night,
and now, it's here.

07:40.787 --> 07:43.747
And you can't think of anyone who would
want to do something like this to you?

07:43.748 --> 07:46.175
I'm immortal. I can think
of too many people.

07:46.176 --> 07:47.701
That's the problem.

07:47.702 --> 07:49.703
So let me help you.

07:49.737 --> 07:52.064
Would you be willing to
serve as a character witness?

07:52.065 --> 07:53.590
That's not what I meant,
and you know it.

07:53.624 --> 07:56.843
I know, but I'm not using
dark magic to get out of this.

07:56.844 --> 07:58.831
Sadly, that's the only
magic that would work.

07:58.832 --> 08:02.041
Is it possible that you've gotten more
stubborn over the last hundred years?

08:02.042 --> 08:05.494
Just because I'm not dealing with this
in the way that you want me to...

08:05.495 --> 08:07.909
You're not dealing
with this at all, Jo.

08:07.922 --> 08:09.787
And you lied to the girls
last night,

08:09.788 --> 08:11.867
telling them that
you banished the shape-shifter.

08:11.868 --> 08:13.769
That's not possible.
You don't know who it is.

08:13.770 --> 08:15.562
I lied so they don't have
to worry,

08:15.563 --> 08:17.864
so that they can get back
to their carefree, normal lives.

08:17.865 --> 08:21.699
Things are not going back to
the way they were! That's over.

08:21.700 --> 08:23.558
The girls know
who they are.

08:23.568 --> 08:25.352
Their powers are only going
to get stronger.

08:25.360 --> 08:27.823
We need to be able to teach them
how to control their gifts,

08:27.824 --> 08:30.377
so they don't hurt someone
or themselves.

08:30.411 --> 08:33.278
You said that you would
help me keep them alive.

08:33.765 --> 08:36.462
That means keeping
them away from magic.

08:38.419 --> 08:41.160
All right, yeah.
Whatever you say.

08:41.162 --> 08:43.163
No magic.

08:45.407 --> 08:47.708
- Whoa...
- Oh, wow. That was so cool.

08:47.709 --> 08:50.339
That was nothing. Wait till you
girls see what I can teach you.

08:50.340 --> 08:53.733
We witches have way more talents
than just spell casting.

08:53.768 --> 08:57.572
Telekinesis, healing powers,
limited weather control.

08:57.573 --> 09:00.106
- We can control the weather?!
- She said "limited."

09:00.107 --> 09:03.647
(thunder crackling,
gasping)

09:03.648 --> 09:05.232
Limited, but still pretty cool.

09:05.233 --> 09:06.983
- How did you do that?
- Wow.

09:06.984 --> 09:08.534
Oh, we all work
in different ways.

09:08.535 --> 09:11.576
I'm ruled by instinct, so,
my powers come from the gut.

09:11.584 --> 09:15.105
Freya, you're ruled by emotion,
so, yours come from the heart.

09:15.154 --> 09:19.170
With practice, you're gonna be able
to read people's deepest desires,

09:19.171 --> 09:21.659
mix potions to make
them fall in love...

09:21.660 --> 09:23.235
- Or fall into bed...
- Really?

09:23.243 --> 09:25.805
Her specialty is sex.
I wouldn't have guessed that.

09:25.806 --> 09:28.492
Oh, really? Well,
what's her specialty? Reading?

09:28.493 --> 09:31.403
Kind of. Ingrid's powers
come from up here.

09:31.404 --> 09:34.507
Strength of mind,
intellect, invention.

09:34.508 --> 09:38.633
Watching you write a spell was like
watching Mozart compose a concerto.

09:38.641 --> 09:41.898
Wait a minute. So I can actually
come up with new spells,

09:41.949 --> 09:43.817
and not just read
old ones in books?

09:43.851 --> 09:45.785
Don't get any ideas.
You're still a novice.

09:45.820 --> 09:49.122
It's gonna take years of learning before
you can even think of writing a spell.

09:49.156 --> 09:51.013
So, what's Mom's
specialty?

09:51.014 --> 09:53.527
Everything. She's
the total package.

09:53.528 --> 09:57.063
When your mom's at full strength,
it's like there's nothing she can't do.

09:57.098 --> 10:00.271
So, can she teach me the spell
that'll get Killian out of my head?

10:00.297 --> 10:03.207
Oh, my God. Between the two of you,
it's like you've been given

10:03.208 --> 10:06.428
a brand-new toolbox with hundreds
of tools you've never seen before,

10:06.429 --> 10:08.606
all you want to do
is use a hammer.

10:08.607 --> 10:12.742
All right, Freya, I want you to try
to skip this stone on the water.

10:12.743 --> 10:13.945
Okay.

10:13.946 --> 10:17.115
Not with your hand.
With your mind.

10:19.507 --> 10:22.509
And, girls, remember,
this is just between us.

10:22.510 --> 10:24.468
We know. We can't tell
anyone we're witches.

10:24.469 --> 10:27.086
No. That, too. But don't tell your
mother that we're doing this,

10:27.087 --> 10:29.414
because she would freak
if you're doing magic.

10:46.931 --> 10:48.798
(hinges creak)

10:58.726 --> 11:01.027
(hinges creak)

11:09.532 --> 11:11.504
(groans)
It isn't working.

11:11.539 --> 11:13.485
Clear your mind.
Concentrate.

11:13.486 --> 11:15.949
Think of nothing else
but what you're trying to do.

11:15.950 --> 11:17.827
(exhales):
Okay.

11:17.878 --> 11:20.413
âª

11:20.448 --> 11:21.998
(deep burbling)

11:26.504 --> 11:28.433
(gasps) What happened?
Did it move?

11:28.434 --> 11:30.884
Yeah. If you were trying
to sink it, you did great.

11:30.885 --> 11:32.293
I suck at this.

11:32.294 --> 11:36.392
Freya, it takes practice; be patient.
All right, Ingrid, your turn.

11:36.393 --> 11:39.113
Same goes for you...
be patient, clear your mind.

11:39.114 --> 11:43.019
I want you to concentrate on dragging
the rock up out of the lake.

11:43.070 --> 11:45.105
(burbling)

11:47.368 --> 11:48.785
(gasps)

11:51.104 --> 11:52.774
(gasps)

11:53.428 --> 11:55.896
I was just trying
to lift the rock.

11:58.081 --> 12:00.732
<i>ConvÃ©rterit libro isto.</i>

12:00.750 --> 12:04.003
<i>ConvÃ©rterit libro isto.</i>

12:05.171 --> 12:07.172
âª

12:09.009 --> 12:10.926
(hinges creak)

12:10.961 --> 12:13.679
(takes deep breath)

12:14.747 --> 12:16.348
(whoosh)

12:17.684 --> 12:18.884
Hmm.

12:18.885 --> 12:20.970
âª

12:47.981 --> 12:50.215
(birds chirping)

12:51.751 --> 12:53.842
(quietly):
"My name shall be cast out..."

12:53.843 --> 12:56.112
(continues indistinctly)

12:56.113 --> 12:57.615
Ingrid. Oh.

12:57.616 --> 12:59.954
(laughs): I'm sorry,
I-I didn't mean to scare you.

12:59.959 --> 13:03.257
No, I-I-I was just...
doing some shelving.

13:03.258 --> 13:05.630
But I can finish later.
What's up?

13:05.648 --> 13:08.133
Well, I wanted to come by
and see if you...

13:08.151 --> 13:09.735
wanted to have
dinner tonight.

13:09.736 --> 13:13.369
Dinner? Like a-a date?
Like a dinner date?

13:13.370 --> 13:16.156
Won't that be weird...
you arrested my mom.

13:16.157 --> 13:17.910
I'm actually
off the case now.

13:17.911 --> 13:20.403
- What? Why?
- Because of our history.

13:20.404 --> 13:22.748
My bosses felt there was
a conflict of interest.

13:22.782 --> 13:25.314
Oh. We have a history?

13:25.329 --> 13:27.986
(laughs): Well, I thought
we were friends. (laughs)

13:28.004 --> 13:30.205
Of course. We are...

13:30.256 --> 13:32.091
- Friends.
- Um...

13:32.125 --> 13:33.675
Ingrid...

13:34.184 --> 13:36.795
- I like you.
- Really?

13:36.829 --> 13:40.432
How many times do I have to tell you that
before you start to believe me?

13:40.467 --> 13:43.001
(laughs): Just one more
would probably do it.

13:43.019 --> 13:45.020
I'm kidding.

13:45.055 --> 13:47.306
Have dinner with me.

13:47.340 --> 13:52.051
Now, I won't mention anything about
the case, so we can just talk about...

13:52.136 --> 13:53.503
Magic...

13:53.504 --> 13:55.447
And voodoo spells.
Yeah, I'm a detective;

13:55.482 --> 13:57.616
I notice things. It's...

13:57.650 --> 14:00.922
It's just an academic study
for my dissertation.

14:00.923 --> 14:03.139
Finally gonna finish. Yay!
(laughs)

14:03.155 --> 14:04.567
Good for you.

14:04.568 --> 14:05.952
So, um...

14:06.270 --> 14:07.823
what do you say?

14:08.338 --> 14:11.997
Look, I know you could use a night out,
and you have to eat, right?

14:12.277 --> 14:14.412
Okay. Yes.

14:14.446 --> 14:15.963
Great.

14:15.998 --> 14:17.445
Um...

14:17.797 --> 14:20.910
- Bye.
- Bye. (laughs)

14:20.911 --> 14:23.329
âª

14:23.555 --> 14:26.329
Enjoy.
Hey, can I get a drink?

14:26.345 --> 14:28.983
Get in line, buddy...
I'm kind of in the weeds here.

14:28.984 --> 14:30.138
Who had a margarita?

14:30.139 --> 14:32.160
I ordered a beer, Freya,
like, ten minutes ago.

14:32.161 --> 14:34.250
- And I ordered a mojito.
- Just give me a minute.

14:34.251 --> 14:35.916
Okay, who had the beer?

14:35.917 --> 14:38.172
What are you doing?
You don't work here.

14:38.173 --> 14:40.519
You obviously need help,
so... I'm helping.

14:40.535 --> 14:42.674
- You really shouldn't be back here.
- Can I get a dirty martini?

14:42.708 --> 14:44.618
- Not a problem.
- He's not a bartender.

14:44.619 --> 14:47.978
Relax, I can handle this.
I'm very experienced.

14:47.996 --> 14:51.315
- WOMAN: I'm still waiting for my mojito.
- Can everyone just relax!

14:56.205 --> 14:57.847
What the hell was that?

14:57.902 --> 15:00.150
Uh, stupid shelves.

15:00.151 --> 15:02.602
They do that sometimes.

15:03.379 --> 15:05.046
(crickets chirping)

15:22.492 --> 15:24.993
âª

15:30.212 --> 15:32.297
WHISPERED VOICE:
Joanna.

15:32.348 --> 15:35.300
(gasps):
Oh! Wendy!

15:35.351 --> 15:39.268
- What are you doing in here?!
- Sorry. I'm sorry.

15:39.269 --> 15:40.861
- I'm sorry. I just...
- What...

15:40.862 --> 15:43.751
I thought if I recreated your dream,
then inspiration would strike.

15:43.777 --> 15:46.980
Well... you scared
the crap out of me.

15:46.981 --> 15:48.844
So, I made a list
of your enemies,

15:48.845 --> 15:52.377
and the list is really, really long, and
I still need your help to finish it.

15:52.403 --> 15:54.903
Do you remember anything
in particular about your dream?

15:54.904 --> 15:57.019
Like, did the shifter
have a weapon, or...?

15:57.020 --> 16:00.158
Yeah, she had this strange
little doll made out of hair.

16:00.209 --> 16:02.276
What? Wait.

16:02.294 --> 16:05.080
I can't believe
you ruined my headboard.

16:05.114 --> 16:06.965
Did it look like this?

16:07.549 --> 16:10.469
- Yeah. What is that?
- It's called an energy talisman.

16:10.495 --> 16:12.971
I knew a guy in New Orleans
who used to make these.

16:13.005 --> 16:17.092
Oh, you mean it's one of those low-rent
voodoo things that's supposed to...

16:17.126 --> 16:20.963
- Suck away your powers?
- No, not <i>supposed</i> to, it does.

16:20.964 --> 16:23.263
It only works on the witch
whose hair it's made of.

16:23.264 --> 16:25.966
Don't underestimate this,
Joanna... I've seen it work.

16:25.967 --> 16:28.181
I put a protection spell
around the house.

16:28.182 --> 16:31.686
You put a protection spell around the
entire town, and somebody broke through.

16:31.687 --> 16:34.845
I think you're into major denial
about how serious this is.

16:34.846 --> 16:37.847
I get it. But you've been gone
a long time, Wendy,

16:37.848 --> 16:40.165
and the girls and I
have been doing just fine.

16:40.199 --> 16:42.897
Really? Just fine?
You're on trial for murder,

16:42.898 --> 16:44.750
the shifter has
already killed me once,

16:44.751 --> 16:47.707
tried to kill Freya... it's time
to go on the offensive.

16:47.708 --> 16:50.493
You're not a parent, Wendy.

16:50.755 --> 16:55.456
You don't understand what it is
to be responsible for another person.

16:56.257 --> 16:59.788
Well, I may not be a parent,
Joanna, but I have a family...

16:59.789 --> 17:03.753
a family that I love and I care about.
I'm trying to protect you,

17:03.754 --> 17:05.761
and you're sitting here
doing laundry!

17:05.779 --> 17:09.898
- <i>Your</i> laundry!
- Oh, I'm sorry, let me help you with that!

17:09.933 --> 17:11.983
Uh, very mature.

17:12.035 --> 17:15.079
You know what, you can't bury
your head in the sand forever, Joanna.

17:15.080 --> 17:17.696
If you don't do something soon,
things are gonna get worse.

17:17.698 --> 17:19.648
A lot worse!

17:19.650 --> 17:21.984
(door slams) (groans)

17:25.965 --> 17:27.916
Okay, concentrate.

17:27.951 --> 17:30.252
Come on, Freya, Ingrid
can empty a freaking lake.

17:30.286 --> 17:31.787
You can do this.

17:35.725 --> 17:37.069
(bottle shatters)

17:37.070 --> 17:39.519
Wow. You really are a klutz.

17:39.520 --> 17:41.625
It's kind of adorable.
(sighs)

17:41.626 --> 17:43.349
What are you doing here?

17:43.400 --> 17:45.841
- I work here.
- No, you don't.

17:45.842 --> 17:47.870
Roger was very impressed with
my skills behind the bar.

17:47.904 --> 17:49.989
He offered me a job,
and I took it.

17:50.023 --> 17:52.358
You took it?

17:52.409 --> 17:55.210
- Why would you do that?
- I need the money.

17:55.211 --> 17:58.759
<i>- You</i> need money? Please.
- My family's rich, I'm not.

17:58.760 --> 18:00.320
I don't believe
that for a second.

18:00.321 --> 18:02.962
Well, it's the truth... I haven't
taken a penny off them.

18:03.689 --> 18:07.296
I've spent the last five years teaching
English in Thailand, surfed in Australia,

18:07.297 --> 18:09.058
tended bar
on three continents.

18:09.092 --> 18:12.094
(sighs) I'm just scraping by now
to get to the next destination.

18:12.128 --> 18:13.710
Well, it sounds incredible.

18:13.711 --> 18:15.347
I've always wanted
to do something like that.

18:15.382 --> 18:17.753
Never been out of East End.

18:18.035 --> 18:19.681
Not even once?

18:19.682 --> 18:22.524
Well, when I was a teenager,
I used to sneak out

18:22.525 --> 18:24.919
and go to New York
with my fake I.D.

18:24.937 --> 18:28.356
And I think I went
on a field trip to DC once.

18:28.390 --> 18:30.525
But basically, no.

18:30.559 --> 18:33.261
I was raised by a single mother.
Schoolteacher.

18:33.279 --> 18:35.972
We weren't exactly jetting off
to Paris every week.

18:35.973 --> 18:38.351
Oh, jetting off to Paris
is overrated anyway.

18:38.359 --> 18:40.401
The one thing I learned
in my travels

18:40.435 --> 18:43.071
is you can be miserable
pretty much anywhere.

18:43.105 --> 18:44.539
And happy anywhere, too.

18:44.840 --> 18:47.492
It's about where
you are inside.

18:47.543 --> 18:50.611
Did a monk teach you that
in Nepal or something?

18:50.629 --> 18:53.266
- I think I read it in a fortune cookie.
- (laughs): Right.

18:53.282 --> 18:55.946
But you got to
admit it's true.

18:55.947 --> 18:57.171
If you're not
being honest

18:57.172 --> 18:59.511
about who you are and what you
really want, you could be living

18:59.512 --> 19:01.563
in a mansion
and it wouldn't really matter.

19:02.631 --> 19:04.832
You still wouldn't feel
quite right.

19:10.035 --> 19:12.433
I still don't think you
working here is a good idea.

19:12.467 --> 19:14.602
Why? Still
having dreams about me?

19:14.636 --> 19:16.404
No.

19:16.438 --> 19:18.706
How come I don't believe you?

19:28.036 --> 19:30.683
Are you freakin'
kidding me?

19:32.588 --> 19:36.475
- Hey, where are you going?
- You work here now, you can clean it up.

19:37.697 --> 19:40.249
- Hey, are you okay?
- I'm fine.

19:40.629 --> 19:43.715
She can be a <i>little</i> dramatic.

19:43.716 --> 19:45.631
Yeah, I noticed.

19:45.632 --> 19:48.041
Well, thank you for
making me do this tonight.

19:48.042 --> 19:49.859
I actually really
needed a night out.

19:49.860 --> 19:52.544
I'm glad I could help
take your mind off the...

19:52.608 --> 19:55.276
- Thing that we're not talking about.
- Mm-mm. (laughs)

19:55.311 --> 19:57.220
It's probably a little
overwhelming for you.

19:57.229 --> 20:00.137
No, I'm actually okay. I guess
I'm not that freaked out,

20:00.138 --> 20:02.434
because I know
my mom didn't do it.

20:04.186 --> 20:05.386
What?

20:06.758 --> 20:09.357
I know we said we wouldn't
talk about the case,

20:09.391 --> 20:12.960
but I give you permission...
dinner is technically over.

20:12.995 --> 20:17.248
Look, I'm just concerned that
you're not taking this very seriously.

20:17.299 --> 20:19.929
Maura Thatcher claims
that she saw your mother

20:19.930 --> 20:22.070
murder
her husband in cold blood.

20:22.675 --> 20:25.406
But people make mistakes.

20:25.441 --> 20:27.975
Especially in
traumatic situations.

20:28.010 --> 20:30.044
And I've read studies
where eyewitnesses

20:30.062 --> 20:34.108
claim to see a short woman that
was really a six-foot-two man.

20:34.109 --> 20:35.842
I know, I know, and
maybe you're right.

20:35.843 --> 20:37.727
I hope you're right.
I just think that...

20:37.808 --> 20:40.342
You need to prepare
yourself for the...

20:40.462 --> 20:43.272
The worst-case scenario.
That's all.

20:44.159 --> 20:46.827
Your mother could...
go to jail...

20:47.363 --> 20:49.564
For a long time.

20:49.598 --> 20:52.033
âª

20:53.502 --> 20:55.920
I should probably
be getting home.

20:55.954 --> 20:59.096
Ingrid... uh, Ingrid, no, let me pay,
and I can walk you.

20:59.097 --> 21:01.709
No. I'm fine.
I could use some fresh air.

21:01.710 --> 21:03.678
But thank you so much
for dinner.

21:03.712 --> 21:06.013
It was really nice.

21:16.975 --> 21:18.976
(heavy breathing)

21:31.568 --> 21:34.570
âª

21:57.744 --> 21:59.745
Hello, Joanna.

22:10.941 --> 22:13.626
(coughing and gasping)

22:38.819 --> 22:40.836
(panting)

22:41.838 --> 22:43.839
(murmurs)

22:49.812 --> 22:51.322
(muffled screaming)

22:51.713 --> 22:54.138
Joanna, stop...
Do you hear me?

22:54.185 --> 22:56.804
I will kill you.
Do you hear me?

22:56.838 --> 23:00.299
This is not over.
(muffled shouting)

23:00.338 --> 23:02.068
I will find you,
I'll kill you!

23:02.069 --> 23:03.703
I will haunt you...

23:13.288 --> 23:15.790
(sighs)

23:21.914 --> 23:24.720
The stories I could tell
about your mother.

23:24.721 --> 23:27.535
You would not believe
the stories that I could tell.

23:27.553 --> 23:30.157
But do I? No, uh-uh.

23:31.498 --> 23:35.518
Because I'm a good sister...
and I'm a good aunt,

23:35.519 --> 23:38.470
maybe not in this lifetime
but in other ones.

23:38.471 --> 23:40.793
I'm sure you were, and
I actually need to talk

23:40.794 --> 23:42.429
to my good aunt
about something.

23:42.430 --> 23:45.543
Ingrid, you're a natural.

23:46.238 --> 23:49.741
You always have been.
I don't want you to forget that.

23:49.775 --> 23:52.381
Um, that's actually what
I want to talk to you about.

23:52.382 --> 23:54.412
I've been thinking
about what you said...

23:54.446 --> 23:56.831
- Okay...
- And about how I can write spells.

23:56.865 --> 23:59.716
- No, n-n-no, it is not possible.
- Why not?

23:59.717 --> 24:03.087
Because there are some spells
that just can't be written.

24:03.122 --> 24:05.715
But you said I was a
spell-writing genius.

24:05.723 --> 24:08.259
Okay, Ingrid
from a hundred years ago,

24:08.293 --> 24:10.762
who had been practicing
magic her entire life,

24:10.796 --> 24:13.247
yes, spell-writing genius.

24:13.265 --> 24:16.270
Ingrid today, who's been
practicing witchcraft

24:16.271 --> 24:18.186
for about five minutes,
not so much.

24:18.220 --> 24:20.221
Okay, but what you may
not know about me is

24:20.255 --> 24:23.441
that I've actually been studying
witchcraft my whole life...

24:23.475 --> 24:26.093
(laughs)
...Academically, historically.

24:26.111 --> 24:28.270
- I even wrote a dissertation.
- Oh...

24:28.296 --> 24:30.984
- And I have books, lots of books.
- You have books?

24:30.985 --> 24:35.381
And in one of them, I think I may have
found a spell that could be tweaked.

24:35.382 --> 24:38.156
No, no, no, please, oh, you don't know
what you're talking about.

24:38.157 --> 24:40.742
Please do not tweak
any spells.

24:40.743 --> 24:44.945
Okay, in fact, do not cast any spells
without my supervision.

24:44.963 --> 24:46.798
It's dangerous.

24:46.832 --> 24:48.492
Okay?

24:48.929 --> 24:51.564
- Okay.
- Do you promise?

24:52.865 --> 24:54.568
I promise.

24:54.790 --> 24:56.290
Okay.

24:56.308 --> 25:00.178
We'll have another lesson tomorrow,
but if we're done here,

25:00.179 --> 25:03.634
there's a really cute guy over by the
pool table that I want to go play with.

25:08.970 --> 25:11.369
Hi.

25:13.992 --> 25:16.360
(Freya and Dash moaning)

25:18.280 --> 25:21.115
So, tell me,
what was more fun...

25:21.149 --> 25:23.287
this or fixing
that guy's heart today?

25:23.288 --> 25:26.548
Yeah, well, it's technically
called an aortic resection, but...

25:26.549 --> 25:28.339
I'm gonna go with this.

25:28.373 --> 25:32.493
Hey, do you mind if I go home tonight?
I know we talked about me staying over.

25:32.511 --> 25:35.296
Wow, I feel so used.

25:35.297 --> 25:36.550
(laughs)

25:36.565 --> 25:40.835
I'm sorry, I just... I feel
like my family needs me.

25:40.853 --> 25:42.186
No, you know what?
You're right.

25:42.221 --> 25:44.222
You, uh, you should be
with your mom right now.

25:44.273 --> 25:47.141
- I understand.
- Ugh, stop being so sweet.

25:47.175 --> 25:49.861
I know I'm being an ass, not
sharing my problems with you.

25:49.895 --> 25:52.681
Hey, you are not
being an ass.

25:52.682 --> 25:54.255
I get it if you
need some space.

25:54.263 --> 25:56.625
No, I don't need any space;
that's not it.

25:56.626 --> 26:00.321
I just...
things are complicated.

26:00.355 --> 26:01.706
What's complicated?

26:01.740 --> 26:06.160
(sighs) My family,
my life, everything.

26:07.132 --> 26:08.412
Hmm.

26:08.463 --> 26:10.715
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

26:10.749 --> 26:12.867
No, it's okay.

26:12.885 --> 26:16.137
Let's, uh, let's talk
about something else.

26:16.171 --> 26:18.539
- So, how was work?
- Weird.

26:18.540 --> 26:20.925
Your brother got
a job at the bar today.

26:20.976 --> 26:22.176
What?

26:22.210 --> 26:24.178
What is the deal with you guys?

26:24.212 --> 26:26.380
(sighing):
Oh, God.

26:26.398 --> 26:29.150
It's a...
it's a long story.

26:29.184 --> 26:31.018
I like long stories.

26:31.933 --> 26:34.054
Right.
(sighs)

26:34.055 --> 26:35.255
Uh...

26:36.491 --> 26:40.613
Look, I... I was
engaged once before.

26:40.614 --> 26:42.619
Okay, I know I should have
told you a long time ago,

26:42.623 --> 26:46.009
but I just didn't feel
like getting into it.

26:47.482 --> 26:49.921
Freya, say something.

26:49.955 --> 26:54.041
You didn't tell me this before because
you "didn't feel like getting into it"?

26:54.075 --> 26:55.760
I don't even think
about her anymore.

26:55.794 --> 26:58.482
All right, our, our relationship
is not like you and me.

26:58.483 --> 26:59.947
So what was it like, then?

26:59.982 --> 27:02.804
It doesn't matter, okay, we
never should have been engaged.

27:03.366 --> 27:05.252
All you need to know

27:05.270 --> 27:07.915
is that Killian slept with her
three months before our wedding,

27:07.916 --> 27:10.362
and that was pretty much
the last time I saw my brother,

27:10.401 --> 27:13.110
so that's the
deal with us.

27:13.145 --> 27:17.264
- Why, why would he...?
- Because that's what he does.

27:17.282 --> 27:19.422
Killian's always been the
black sheep of our family.

27:19.423 --> 27:22.806
I mean, he got kicked out of every
prep school on the East Coast, he...

27:22.807 --> 27:24.764
God, he can't hold a job
for more than a few months,

27:24.765 --> 27:26.721
he's never had a real
relationship with a woman,

27:26.722 --> 27:28.505
and for some reason
he blames me.

27:28.927 --> 27:32.113
Maybe it's because
I <i>didn't</i> screw up my life

27:32.147 --> 27:35.049
or because I take responsibility for
things, so going after my girlfriends...

27:35.083 --> 27:37.218
it's always been
like this little game to him.

27:37.252 --> 27:40.221
See what kind of damage
he can cause.

27:40.255 --> 27:44.458
I don't know, I-I guess
it's his revenge or something.

27:44.476 --> 27:46.460
So, he's done this
more than once?

27:46.470 --> 27:50.343
Not successfully, but yeah,
he always tries. It's pathetic.

27:50.671 --> 27:53.734
I wouldn't be surprised if
he's gearing up to hit on you.

27:58.634 --> 28:00.274
Hey.

28:00.308 --> 28:04.779
Babe, I am, I am so sorry.

28:04.813 --> 28:06.798
Okay, you know I love you.

28:07.983 --> 28:10.751
I know, I just... I think
I need to be alone right now.

28:10.786 --> 28:12.787
I'll call you tomorrow.

28:17.459 --> 28:19.994
"The price shall not be paid,

28:20.012 --> 28:23.297
my soul is free from bondage."

28:23.332 --> 28:27.101
Shit, what's the Latin word
for "bondage"?

28:27.135 --> 28:28.853
(gasps)

28:28.887 --> 28:30.388
<i>Servitute.</i>

28:30.439 --> 28:32.306
That sounds right.

28:32.340 --> 28:35.026
Okay.

28:38.146 --> 28:40.481
Here goes nothing.

28:43.068 --> 28:45.069
Ugh.

28:51.243 --> 28:54.078
<i>Pretium non solvatur,</i>

28:54.129 --> 28:58.883
<i>libera animam meam a servitute.</i>

28:58.917 --> 29:01.368
<i>Quia illud velle ita.</i>

29:01.386 --> 29:04.705
<i>Quia illud velle...</i>

29:04.723 --> 29:07.091
(gasping)

29:14.382 --> 29:16.934
(screaming, cries)

29:17.936 --> 29:21.695
(screaming):
Help...!

29:23.719 --> 29:25.720
(gasps)

29:28.441 --> 29:30.442
(footfalls approaching)

29:32.695 --> 29:34.813
Ingrid.

29:34.864 --> 29:36.448
<i>Vade, daemonia.</i>

29:36.482 --> 29:40.902
<i>Animas vestras
ad infernum remittitur.</i>

29:40.936 --> 29:43.971
<i>Dimittam... dimittam.</i>

29:43.972 --> 29:45.420
Aunt Wendy.

29:45.421 --> 29:47.728
<i>Dimittam, dimittam.</i>

29:47.729 --> 29:49.268
What are you doing here?

29:49.286 --> 29:52.621
I knew you wouldn't listen to me.
You're a lot like your mother that way.

29:52.622 --> 29:53.907
You're gonna be okay.

29:53.941 --> 29:56.009
<i>Sana glacies.</i>

29:56.043 --> 29:58.411
(Ingrid whimpering)

29:58.445 --> 30:00.446
<i>Sana glacies.</i>

30:02.333 --> 30:05.117
<i>Sana glacies.</i>
Stay with me.

30:05.135 --> 30:06.419
Thank you.

30:06.453 --> 30:11.391
<i>Sana glacies.</i>
<i>Sana glacies.</i>

30:18.349 --> 30:20.846
- What are you doing back here?
- Forgot my jacket.

30:21.185 --> 30:22.821
Okay, that's bullshit.

30:22.822 --> 30:25.321
I mean, I did forget my jacket,
but that is not why I'm here.

30:25.356 --> 30:28.121
I just wanted to look you in your face
when I told you this:

30:28.144 --> 30:29.756
I'm on to you.

30:29.967 --> 30:33.664
Would it shock you to know I have
no idea what you're talking about?

30:33.665 --> 30:36.199
I know why you've been pretending
you have all these feelings for me

30:36.200 --> 30:38.726
and that we have this deep connection,
but you can cut the crap.

30:38.727 --> 30:41.120
You and Dash need to work
out your problems yourselves.

30:41.121 --> 30:43.756
Or don't... I don't really care.
Just leave me out of it.

30:44.015 --> 30:46.148
You may have slept with one
fiancÃ©e,

30:46.149 --> 30:48.107
but you are never going
to sleep with this one.

30:48.108 --> 30:49.929
Are you done now?

30:49.964 --> 30:51.831
I notice you're not
denying anything.

30:51.849 --> 30:54.467
Look, I did sleep
with Elyse.

30:54.501 --> 30:56.436
Oh, why would you
tell me her name?

30:56.470 --> 30:59.138
But that was a long time ago, and for
the record, things in their relationship

30:59.172 --> 31:00.773
were pretty screwed up
to begin with.

31:00.808 --> 31:02.308
Oh, whatever... I know
you have tried to sleep

31:02.342 --> 31:04.560
with every woman
Dash has ever dated.

31:04.756 --> 31:07.487
- Is that what he told you?
- Is it the truth?

31:07.488 --> 31:09.365
Would you believe me
if I said it wasn't?

31:09.400 --> 31:12.858
- Why should I believe anything you say?
- Exactly.

31:16.490 --> 31:19.125
I haven't been
pretending, Freya.

31:20.377 --> 31:22.912
I don't know
how much clearer I can be.

31:23.209 --> 31:25.577
Do you really expect me
to fall for that?

31:25.611 --> 31:28.046
No, I don't expect anything
except for you to admit

31:28.047 --> 31:30.715
that there is a connection
here and we both know it.

31:33.286 --> 31:37.389
No, the only connection we have is
that we work together in this bar

31:37.423 --> 31:39.675
and I'm marrying
your brother.

31:39.726 --> 31:40.926
That's all.

31:42.824 --> 31:44.620
Good night.

32:07.453 --> 32:09.788
Mmm.

32:25.782 --> 32:28.951
Okay.

32:32.145 --> 32:33.445
Huh.

32:33.479 --> 32:35.814
(gasps)

32:39.852 --> 32:41.953
Who the hell are you?!

32:44.227 --> 32:46.311
(groans)

32:48.527 --> 32:50.195
(gasps)

32:50.213 --> 32:51.529
Mom?

32:51.547 --> 32:53.977
- Freya... use your powers.
- Freya, use your powers.

32:53.993 --> 32:57.861
Freya Eilif Beauchamp, you have
permission to use your powers!

33:15.688 --> 33:19.453
(Freya gasps,
Joanna sighs)

33:19.454 --> 33:21.393
Oh, my God, Mom,
are you okay?

33:21.394 --> 33:23.739
Oh, God. Are you all right?

33:23.740 --> 33:26.196
Yeah. Oh, what the hell!

33:26.199 --> 33:28.066
I thought you
took care of her.

33:28.084 --> 33:31.046
I sort of lied.

33:33.122 --> 33:37.242
FREYA: Why? Why do you always lie?

33:37.276 --> 33:41.589
- Why does everyone always lie?
- Who else is lying?

33:41.644 --> 33:45.238
Me. I'm lying
to Dash every single day.

33:45.285 --> 33:48.578
I'm hiding this huge thing from
him for the rest of our lives.

33:48.579 --> 33:49.967
How do I do that?

33:49.968 --> 33:54.855
How do I marry someone when I have
this giant secret about who I am?

33:54.890 --> 33:59.843
Because you're so much more
than just a witch, Freya.

33:59.861 --> 34:01.979
You're still the same smart,

34:02.014 --> 34:06.126
talented, caring and beautiful
woman that you've always been.

34:06.127 --> 34:08.946
And that's who Dash fell in love
with, and that hasn't changed.

34:10.522 --> 34:12.356
Okay.

34:12.373 --> 34:14.692
I love you, Freya.

34:14.710 --> 34:18.027
I know how strong you are,
and I know you can do this.

34:19.654 --> 34:21.821
That knife throw...

34:22.301 --> 34:24.534
That was pretty impressive.

34:24.534 --> 34:27.467
I know. I can't believe
it actually worked.

34:27.469 --> 34:29.907
That was the first time I've done
something like that on purpose.

34:29.942 --> 34:31.425
Finally!

34:31.476 --> 34:32.810
I'm proud of you, baby.

34:32.844 --> 34:35.313
- Thanks.
- You did good.

34:35.347 --> 34:39.266
With a little practice, you'll gain
greater control of your gifts.

34:39.318 --> 34:41.686
Ooh, does that mean you're
actually gonna let me practice?

34:41.719 --> 34:44.688
Ooh, does that mean
I could have stopped you?

34:44.723 --> 34:47.768
It's time, and you're ready.

34:47.770 --> 34:52.512
I'm not, but I wasn't ready
for you to start dating...

34:52.513 --> 34:54.031
In any century.

34:54.032 --> 34:56.283
And I couldn't stop you
then, either

34:56.293 --> 34:59.264
- Come...
- I love you, Mom.

34:59.265 --> 35:01.817
Mm.
(sighs)

35:02.040 --> 35:04.908
Hey, didn't you burn that?

35:06.261 --> 35:08.379
I did.

35:08.413 --> 35:12.466
You're not the only one
in this house with cool powers.

35:12.517 --> 35:14.760
Oh.

35:22.713 --> 35:23.978
Sorry.

35:24.490 --> 35:26.697
You missed last call.

35:26.732 --> 35:30.708
For the record, I know exactly
what you're up to.

35:30.731 --> 35:32.603
Oh, well, maybe you
do, maybe you don't.

35:32.621 --> 35:35.539
Either way, it has no
effect on me or my plans.

35:35.574 --> 35:38.173
Yeah, well, look, I'm thinking maybe
you should change your plans.

35:38.174 --> 35:40.402
'Cause you won't win this
one, Killian, I promise.

35:40.481 --> 35:42.182
I don't want you
getting hurt.

35:42.183 --> 35:44.864
Appreciate the concern.
I'll take it under advisement.

35:44.883 --> 35:48.339
Fine. You know, you
just do your thing.

35:48.340 --> 35:51.305
Play it as cool as you want,
pretend nothing bothers you.

35:51.306 --> 35:55.459
But the real Killian
always shows himself eventually.

35:55.477 --> 35:57.762
And that's
when it all goes wrong.

35:57.796 --> 36:01.232
Oh, yeah?
What about the real you?

36:01.266 --> 36:03.517
You told Freya
what I did five years ago,

36:03.568 --> 36:05.478
but did you tell her
the rest of the story?

36:07.272 --> 36:08.989
(motorcycle engine revving)

36:09.024 --> 36:10.741
Yeah.

36:10.776 --> 36:12.993
Didn't think so.

36:13.028 --> 36:16.447
(engine revving)

36:16.481 --> 36:19.983
They still feel
really cold.

36:20.001 --> 36:21.952
(sighs)

36:21.986 --> 36:24.655
It's gonna take a few more minutes
before they're normal again.

36:24.673 --> 36:27.842
Don't worry.
You're gonna be okay.

36:27.876 --> 36:31.791
That was just
so awful, scary.

36:31.807 --> 36:34.882
Did you really feel that you could
just pull something like this off

36:34.933 --> 36:36.834
after knowing
you're a witch for a week?

36:36.852 --> 36:41.105
I guess I wasn't thinking.
I just wanted to do something.

36:41.106 --> 36:42.802
I don't want someone to die.

36:42.809 --> 36:46.695
I know, but putting yourself
in danger is not the answer.

36:47.643 --> 36:51.189
I really can't change
this curse, can I?

36:51.190 --> 36:54.526
What's destined to happen will happen.
It's already in motion.

36:54.736 --> 36:56.537
And you can't spend
every day

36:56.571 --> 36:59.206
worrying about it, or you're
gonna drive yourself crazy.

36:59.241 --> 37:01.024
I know.

37:02.358 --> 37:04.984
You have to live your life.
(door opening)

37:05.023 --> 37:06.831
ADAM:
Hello?

37:06.865 --> 37:08.632
Hello.
(door closes)

37:08.667 --> 37:12.703
Oh, I, uh... I saw your car,
so I figured you might still be here.

37:15.092 --> 37:17.427
I will see you at home.

37:19.260 --> 37:21.192
Adam.

37:22.898 --> 37:25.412
Before you say anything,
I just...

37:27.269 --> 37:30.579
- I just want to apologize.
- You don't have to do that.

37:30.580 --> 37:34.276
It's not like we can pretend
this stuff with my mom isn't happening.

37:34.277 --> 37:36.162
I could have been
more sensitive.

37:36.163 --> 37:38.364
You shouldn't have
to walk on eggshells.

37:39.781 --> 37:42.249
I just think...

37:42.284 --> 37:44.919
Maybe we missed our window.

37:44.953 --> 37:48.906
You know, maybe we should have
done this a long time ago

37:48.924 --> 37:50.875
when things were simpler.

37:50.909 --> 37:53.210
Maybe it's too late now.

37:53.244 --> 37:57.056
Or... maybe you know your mom
better than me,

37:57.057 --> 37:58.903
and I should have just
shut up about it.

37:58.904 --> 38:04.230
Adam, it's just, my life
is so complicated right now,

38:04.231 --> 38:07.274
and I don't think you should
subject yourself to that.

38:07.309 --> 38:09.927
I'm a big boy.

38:09.945 --> 38:11.929
And I know
my timing's not the best,

38:11.947 --> 38:14.648
but I have waited too long
to have our first date,

38:14.699 --> 38:18.319
and I don't want
to wait any more for our second.

38:18.370 --> 38:21.602
If that even counts
as a first date. It...

38:28.613 --> 38:30.915
I think it does now.

38:39.424 --> 38:42.793
WENDY: So Freya really sent
the knife across the kitchen?

38:42.811 --> 38:44.345
- Mm-hmm, mm.
- That's great!

38:44.396 --> 38:47.307
I mean, it's not great that the shifter
broke through your protection spell.

38:47.308 --> 38:50.234
I was just so out of
practice, I was overwhelmed.

38:50.235 --> 38:53.303
And you couldn't tell anything about
the shifter? About who it was?

38:53.321 --> 38:54.822
No, not a thing.

38:54.856 --> 38:58.692
Only that they were good
and fast and looked like me,

38:58.743 --> 39:00.744
only, I think
I have better hair.

39:00.779 --> 39:02.312
You do have
really great hair.

39:02.330 --> 39:03.831
Thanks.

39:04.361 --> 39:09.653
Okay, this is really hard for me
to say, but I think you were right.

39:09.671 --> 39:12.256
Don't say anything! Don't.

39:12.290 --> 39:15.376
I <i>do</i> have trouble
letting people help me.

39:15.427 --> 39:18.661
It's like I'm a little bit
set in my ways.

39:18.662 --> 39:21.405
Okay, I'm a lot
set in my ways.

39:21.429 --> 39:25.335
So maybe I need to loosen up,
enjoy it all more.

39:25.353 --> 39:27.004
I can certainly
help you with that.

39:27.022 --> 39:28.505
(laughter)

39:28.523 --> 39:31.569
And maybe I need to grow
up just-just a little bit.

39:31.595 --> 39:33.110
- Mm-hmm.
- But not too much,

39:33.111 --> 39:35.529
so, maybe we can just
meet in the middle?

39:35.563 --> 39:38.315
Works for me.

39:39.121 --> 39:41.351
So you can keep teaching
them, and I will, too.

39:41.369 --> 39:43.904
- I didn't...
- Oh, please!

39:43.955 --> 39:47.690
You think Freya could have pulled that
off without a few lessons from you?

39:47.713 --> 39:49.543
I think I know my
sister pretty well.

39:49.577 --> 39:51.903
INGRID: Hey, Mom.
Are you okay?

39:51.904 --> 39:53.962
I am. I am.

39:53.965 --> 39:59.586
I have been doing a lot of thinking
about you girls being witches.

39:59.638 --> 40:01.472
It is who you are.

40:01.506 --> 40:03.474
It's who you've always been,

40:03.508 --> 40:06.543
and there is no shoving
that cat back in the bag.

40:06.561 --> 40:09.513
- (gasps) Oh.
- I'm sorry. No offense, Wendy.

40:09.547 --> 40:10.907
(laughter)

40:10.933 --> 40:15.263
Your aunt and I are gonna teach
you girls everything we know,

40:15.264 --> 40:18.769
and we are gonna get
through all of this...

40:18.784 --> 40:21.118
As a family.

40:22.944 --> 40:28.858
This is not the first time that we've had
to pull together to protect ourselves,

40:29.163 --> 40:31.285
and it won't be the last.

40:31.784 --> 40:35.839
INGRID: Actually, I would like
to stay away from magic for a while.

40:35.874 --> 40:38.386
JOANNA: Well, we can...

40:38.387 --> 40:40.427
We can talk about
that tomorrow, honey,

40:40.462 --> 40:44.196
because, right now,
I need all of your help.

40:51.053 --> 40:53.722
So, what's the spell for?

40:53.723 --> 40:57.861
We are fighting dark with light,
utilizing our life force.

40:57.862 --> 41:01.168
WENDY: It's basically
an invisible wall of protection

41:01.169 --> 41:04.000
around the entire house,
and hopefully, each of us.

41:04.007 --> 41:06.785
Oh, can I make the potions
from now on?

41:07.344 --> 41:08.544
Ugh.

41:10.120 --> 41:11.662
Okay.

41:16.014 --> 41:17.581
