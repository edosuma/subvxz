00:33.030 --> 00:36.197
- I always wanted to be in the movies.

00:40.849 --> 00:45.422
I was almost a star.

00:45.422 --> 00:46.255
Almost.

00:51.923 --> 00:55.473
Then something happened
that took my dream away.

01:09.070 --> 01:13.193
- I liked standing,
I thought it was romantic.

01:14.320 --> 01:18.230
- If you think I was gonna let
some guy run off with my girl

01:18.230 --> 01:21.230
while I fight a bunch of
crabs, you must be dizzy.

01:21.230 --> 01:22.950
- Well, every gal wants a guy that's gonna

01:22.950 --> 01:26.150
sacrifice himself for her, it's romantic.

01:26.150 --> 01:27.970
- You see, that's the problem.

01:27.970 --> 01:30.920
Bogart used to play the tough
guy, now he just plays a sap.

01:32.183 --> 01:34.163
- Well, you're my tough guy.

01:38.140 --> 01:40.210
- Hey, what're you doing in here?

01:40.210 --> 01:41.160
I'm talking to you.

01:42.995 --> 01:45.162
Get outta here, go on, go.

01:48.690 --> 01:50.303
- People gotta learn their place.

02:09.643 --> 02:12.990
- Hey, don't look
now, but I think I see Mona

02:12.990 --> 02:15.280
Lane sitting over there in a
booth drinking a milkshake.

02:15.280 --> 02:17.154
- Where?
- I said don't look.

02:17.154 --> 02:19.354
I don't want
you to embarrass me.

02:22.573 --> 02:27.280
And I think I see Jimmy
Stance over there with her.

02:27.280 --> 02:29.130
I've read that those two are an item.

02:30.220 --> 02:31.120
I guess it's true.

02:32.090 --> 02:34.870
- Movie stars are people
just like us, they've gotta

02:34.870 --> 02:37.420
put their pants on one leg
at a time, just like me.

02:48.260 --> 02:50.460
- Hey, I told you to get outta here, boy.

02:50.460 --> 02:51.747
Don't shoot.

02:59.290 --> 03:00.490
- That's how things went down

03:00.490 --> 03:01.950
at the Moonlight Cafe,

03:01.950 --> 03:04.890
the night Mona Lane got
kidnapped by a gang of Negros.

03:04.890 --> 03:07.270
Or at least that's how
the newspapers told it.

03:07.270 --> 03:09.400
But we got plenty of time to get to that.

03:09.400 --> 03:13.929
This story is as much about
me, as it is about her.

03:18.840 --> 03:21.630
As a kid, I could still
remember goin' to the pictures,

03:21.630 --> 03:24.550
watchin' gangsters and
cowboys on the big screen.

03:24.550 --> 03:27.090
I wanted to be up there,
bigger than everyone.

03:27.090 --> 03:29.519
Bigger than life, on top of the world.

03:32.877 --> 03:35.220
I always liked pretending
to be other people.

03:35.220 --> 03:37.230
That's me, Archie Glass.

03:37.230 --> 03:40.450
Just a few months from
hoboing my way from Georgia.

03:40.450 --> 03:44.010
It wasn't long before I
found myself on Central Av.

03:44.010 --> 03:46.690
The center of Negro life in Los Angeles.

03:46.690 --> 03:49.970
I fell in love with
Los Angeles that night.

03:49.970 --> 03:52.257
I started busing tables, then
worked my way up to doorman at

03:52.257 --> 03:55.480
the Dun Bar Club, which was
the hottest spot in South LA.

03:55.480 --> 03:56.920
Every night was like a party.

03:56.920 --> 03:58.560
You never knew who would walk in.

03:58.560 --> 04:01.520
Leroy Tucker was a black man from Compton,

04:01.520 --> 04:03.560
who had Indian in him
from his momma's side.

04:03.560 --> 04:05.460
It was enough for him to pass as Mexican,

04:05.460 --> 04:08.260
and get work as an outlaw
bandit in westerns.

04:08.260 --> 04:10.930
Big Nadine Lomax worked a lot.

04:10.930 --> 04:13.200
Whenever the studios needed
someone to play a maid,

04:13.200 --> 04:14.760
they called Nadine.

04:14.760 --> 04:16.459
She played maids in so many pictures,

04:16.459 --> 04:19.200
they gave her an Oscar for it.

04:19.200 --> 04:20.237
These people?

04:20.237 --> 04:22.780
No one cared about them in Hollywood.

04:22.780 --> 04:26.220
They were overlooked, or they
was just a butt of jokes.

04:26.220 --> 04:30.230
But down on Central Av, they
were treated like stars.

04:30.230 --> 04:32.380
There was magic in
every gesture they made.

04:33.490 --> 04:37.123
Every smile was a window
into a new kind of freedom.

04:38.790 --> 04:40.190
And the biggest of them all?

04:41.200 --> 04:42.770
Ennis Matthews.

04:42.770 --> 04:45.330
They called him the brown
clown, he had a series of

04:45.330 --> 04:48.333
short films where he played
America's favorite Negro clown.

04:49.250 --> 04:50.760
Ennis always dressed sharp,

04:50.760 --> 04:52.963
and smoked these fancy cigars from Cuba.

04:54.250 --> 04:55.200
I looked up to him.

04:56.579 --> 04:57.963
I wanted to be just like him.

05:06.050 --> 05:07.250
- What's your name, kid?

05:08.330 --> 05:09.950
- Archie.

05:09.950 --> 05:11.073
Archie Glass.

05:12.890 --> 05:14.063
- Well, Archie Glass.

05:16.166 --> 05:16.999
You don't look like a man

05:16.999 --> 05:18.620
who wants to be a doorman all his life.

05:19.756 --> 05:21.810
- I wanna be like you.

05:21.810 --> 05:23.083
I wanna be in the pictures.

05:26.080 --> 05:27.673
- I got a hot tip for you, if you want it.

05:29.190 --> 05:30.160
- Sure, I mean...

05:31.160 --> 05:32.610
Yes.

05:32.610 --> 05:33.840
- Go down to Central Casting.

05:33.840 --> 05:36.810
They got a new Negro office open.

05:36.810 --> 05:38.236
Tell 'em I sent you.

05:38.236 --> 05:40.586
They're lookin' to put
colored folks in movies.

05:41.890 --> 05:43.040
- Thank you, thank you.

05:47.647 --> 05:50.480
I just need one break, mister.

05:50.480 --> 05:53.736
One chance to do something
big in this world.

05:53.736 --> 05:56.280
If you give me that chance, I promise you,

05:56.280 --> 05:58.003
I promise you, you won't be sorry.

05:59.157 --> 06:00.450
Wait.

06:00.450 --> 06:01.283
Is that a gun?

06:02.160 --> 06:03.810
Why are you pointing a gun at me?

06:05.460 --> 06:06.910
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang!

06:09.306 --> 06:12.277
Look at me, Ma, I made it!

06:12.277 --> 06:13.694
Top of the world!

06:14.576 --> 06:17.190
- Are you going to keep playing
gangster in that mirror?

06:17.190 --> 06:20.403
Or are you gonna come over
here and keep me warm?

06:29.972 --> 06:31.097
- The first time I saw Sandra,

06:31.097 --> 06:33.433
was standin' outside the Dun Bar Hotel.

06:34.270 --> 06:36.720
She was like a peacock
struttin' down the street.

06:37.900 --> 06:40.643
She sang four nights a
week at the Foxtrot Cafe.

06:42.340 --> 06:43.840
I'm not sure what was sweeter.

06:45.060 --> 06:46.480
Her voice on stage...

06:48.180 --> 06:49.230
Or her kisses in bed.

07:05.820 --> 07:07.688
That was real fine, baby.

07:07.688 --> 07:11.440
You sure know how to
make a fella feel good.

07:11.440 --> 07:13.269
- You're a good sweet talker.

07:13.269 --> 07:14.659
- I'm a good actor.

07:14.659 --> 07:16.980
I mean, I'm a doorman right now, but,

07:16.980 --> 07:18.680
I'm gonna be in the pictures soon.

07:19.789 --> 07:23.078
- I can't believe I hopped
in bed with an actor!

07:24.320 --> 07:26.233
My mama would whoop me good!

07:27.510 --> 07:29.800
- What's wrong with being an actor?

07:29.800 --> 07:31.180
- Nothin'!

07:31.180 --> 07:35.030
If you're Clark Gable or Betty Davis.

07:35.030 --> 07:40.030
Then you could be a pirate or
a princess, or even a cowboy.

07:42.259 --> 07:43.823
That come and save the day.

07:46.140 --> 07:48.103
But, if you are black,

07:51.250 --> 07:53.323
the movies is just like real life.

07:54.768 --> 07:57.810
You're just the maid or
somebody's go-fetch boy.

07:57.810 --> 08:00.740
- I know there ain't a lot
of work for a Negro man,

08:00.740 --> 08:02.753
but that's gonna change and when it does,

08:04.360 --> 08:06.110
I wanna be the first.

08:07.207 --> 08:09.940
- You're gonna be waiting
a long time for that.

08:09.940 --> 08:11.470
- Not for too long.

08:11.470 --> 08:13.933
I got me an audition at Victory Studio.

08:15.469 --> 08:17.440
They're lookin' for Negro actors.

08:17.440 --> 08:20.027
Soon, you're gonna see
my name at the Ricaknie.

08:20.027 --> 08:24.427
"Archie Glass, the greatest
American actor alive."

09:29.330 --> 09:30.163
- Come in.

09:31.260 --> 09:32.093
Sit down.

09:34.810 --> 09:36.380
What's your name?

09:36.380 --> 09:37.700
- Glass, sir.

09:37.700 --> 09:39.143
Archie Glass.

09:41.150 --> 09:43.470
- How'd you hear about this job?

09:43.470 --> 09:46.190
- Fella I met in a bar said
y'all was lookin' for black

09:46.190 --> 09:49.640
folks, so I figured I fit the
description and came on over.

09:49.640 --> 09:51.700
- So, here's the skinny, okay?

09:51.700 --> 09:55.670
The studio wants to start
usin' Negro folk instead of

09:55.670 --> 09:59.140
white actors who are dressed
up as Negros in makeup.

09:59.140 --> 10:02.760
Now, a lot of good white
actors have lost their jobs

10:02.760 --> 10:07.760
because of it, but, what the
studio wants, the studio gets.

10:09.380 --> 10:11.020
All right?

10:11.020 --> 10:11.970
Turn to your right.

10:13.300 --> 10:14.900
Look up.

10:14.900 --> 10:15.773
The other side.

10:19.917 --> 10:24.260
Okay, you look black enough
to me to be a real Negro.

10:24.260 --> 10:26.570
- I'm a man, sir, and an actor.

10:26.570 --> 10:28.150
- Not a hothead, are you?
- No, sir.

10:28.150 --> 10:29.703
- I don't need any hotheads.

10:31.800 --> 10:32.673
No? Okay.

10:34.160 --> 10:37.173
Okay, you ever been in
front of the camera before?

10:39.085 --> 10:41.170
Have you ever acted?

10:41.170 --> 10:43.340
- A little, sir, one or two church plays.

10:43.340 --> 10:47.370
- Well, I've seen eight other
guys just like you today.

10:47.370 --> 10:50.280
What makes you different than them?

10:50.280 --> 10:51.370
- When I was a little young pup,

10:51.370 --> 10:55.130
I got myself in some
trouble, wind up in jail.

10:55.130 --> 10:58.890
I was in there with grown men
and I wanted to cry every day.

10:58.890 --> 11:01.363
I was afraid, but I
couldn't let them see that.

11:02.500 --> 11:06.503
So, I guess, sir, I can say
I've been actin' my whole life.

11:07.786 --> 11:09.380
- Yeah, well, you're not gonna
be doin' any Shakespeare.

11:09.380 --> 11:10.213
All right?

11:10.213 --> 11:11.810
Just a line or two here and there,

11:11.810 --> 11:15.560
keep the story moving around,
keep the audience laughin'.

11:15.560 --> 11:16.943
Got it?
- Yes, sir.

11:17.805 --> 11:19.180
- You know how to read?

11:19.180 --> 11:20.700
- Yes, sir.

11:20.700 --> 11:21.863
- All right, read this.

11:26.750 --> 11:28.127
When you're ready.

11:28.127 --> 11:30.777
- "All the world is a stage,

11:30.777 --> 11:34.787
"and all the men and
women, merely players.

11:34.787 --> 11:37.883
"They have their exits and an entrance.

11:40.507 --> 11:43.877
"And one man plays many parts."

11:50.380 --> 11:52.140
- Not bad for a colored.

11:52.140 --> 11:53.950
I mean, you've gotta hear
the guys comin' here.

11:53.950 --> 11:56.300
I don't understand a damn
thing they're sayin'.

11:58.036 --> 11:58.869
Okay.

12:03.410 --> 12:06.403
Take this slip down to wardrobe.

12:07.840 --> 12:10.403
They're gonna get you
fitted for a porter uniform.

12:11.510 --> 12:14.450
And then I want you to
come back here, tomorrow.

12:14.450 --> 12:19.230
Stage seven at 6:30 AM.

12:19.230 --> 12:20.230
Got it?
- Yes, sir.

12:24.212 --> 12:25.045
Thank you, sir.

12:25.045 --> 12:27.450
You won't regret it.
- I know, go.

12:27.450 --> 12:28.498
Next.

12:56.570 --> 12:57.403
- Cheers.

13:08.108 --> 13:09.850
- Donny!

13:09.850 --> 13:10.933
How are you?

13:11.839 --> 13:13.250
- I'm better now.

13:13.250 --> 13:15.188
Where have you been keeping yourself?

13:15.188 --> 13:17.260
I haven't seen you at the club in a week.

13:17.260 --> 13:18.620
- I've been around.

13:18.620 --> 13:20.833
Donny, this is Archie Glass.

13:22.010 --> 13:23.860
- Like I said, where have you been?

13:23.860 --> 13:27.110
I thought we had a good time
the last time we went out.

13:27.110 --> 13:28.110
- Who is this clown?

13:29.280 --> 13:31.090
- Keep your cool, nigga.

13:31.090 --> 13:33.763
This is a nice place, for nice folks.

13:35.095 --> 13:37.223
It's always my pleasure.

13:48.410 --> 13:50.000
- I said, who was that?

13:51.017 --> 13:53.322
- That's Donny Obrex.

13:53.322 --> 13:55.980
He leads the orchestra
that I used to sing in.

13:55.980 --> 13:58.750
He's been wantin' me to
get back with the band.

13:58.750 --> 14:00.450
- I think he wants more than that.

14:02.110 --> 14:03.310
- We were together once.

14:07.490 --> 14:08.590
Before you came along.

14:09.670 --> 14:12.483
So, tell me, how did you get the part?

14:14.130 --> 14:15.783
What did you do to beat
all those other guys

14:15.783 --> 14:17.083
that were better than you?

14:19.079 --> 14:21.180
- I just told that fat
cat casting director

14:21.180 --> 14:23.097
what he wanted to hear.

14:25.130 --> 14:26.797
- And what was that?

14:27.943 --> 14:31.570
- A sob story about having
to pretend to be other people

14:31.570 --> 14:33.420
in order to survive when I was young.

14:34.680 --> 14:35.530
- It wasn't true?

14:37.179 --> 14:38.012
- Sure it was.

14:40.510 --> 14:42.343
- You're awfully good at play acting.

14:44.360 --> 14:45.560
But sometimes, I wonder.

14:46.800 --> 14:49.903
Who is the real Archie Glass?

14:51.540 --> 14:52.373
- Hey.

14:54.005 --> 14:55.463
I see somebody at the bar I know.

14:58.605 --> 15:00.688
I'll be right back, baby.

15:03.940 --> 15:05.183
Hey, Ennis!

15:06.510 --> 15:08.253
Hey, I owe you a drink.

15:09.810 --> 15:11.770
That tip you gave me really paid off.

15:11.770 --> 15:12.803
I'm in a movie now.

15:12.803 --> 15:15.010
It's a small part, but it's a start.

15:15.010 --> 15:16.343
And I owe it all to you.

15:17.330 --> 15:18.233
- Congratulations.

15:20.210 --> 15:22.100
What's your name again?

15:22.100 --> 15:23.343
- Archie Glass.

15:25.540 --> 15:26.440
- To Archie Glass!

15:28.140 --> 15:31.787
The greatest actor, on Central Avenue.

15:40.570 --> 15:43.432
- Come on, Ennis, we
gotta go do that thing.

15:43.432 --> 15:45.932
Man, get your stuff, let's go.

16:38.903 --> 16:42.640
- All right, camera rolling?
- Cameras are rolling!

16:42.640 --> 16:43.563
- Sound speeding?

16:45.720 --> 16:46.553
Actor ready?

16:51.000 --> 16:54.757
Okay, now listen, all
you need to say is,

16:54.757 --> 16:57.700
"I don't know, boss, I thinks
this place is haunted!"

16:57.700 --> 16:58.533
Okay?

16:59.520 --> 17:01.203
And action!

17:02.160 --> 17:05.022
- I don't know, boss, I
think this place is haunted.

17:06.020 --> 17:07.040
- Cut.

17:07.040 --> 17:08.630
All right, I think that was swell.

17:08.630 --> 17:10.550
Okay, let's try another one.

17:10.550 --> 17:12.387
This time, I want you to say, um,

17:12.387 --> 17:16.839
"I thinks this place is haunted
and I'm afraid of ghosts!"

17:16.839 --> 17:18.300
Action!

17:18.300 --> 17:21.343
- I thinks this place is haunted
and I'm afraid of ghosts.

17:23.960 --> 17:25.880
- All right, all right, that was great.

17:25.880 --> 17:27.233
Now, try this one on.

17:28.146 --> 17:29.867
"I is afraid of ghosts.

17:29.867 --> 17:33.744
"I think I might get so
scared, I may just turn white!"

17:33.744 --> 17:36.350
Give it all you got, all right?

17:36.350 --> 17:37.963
And action!

17:39.050 --> 17:40.480
- I is afraid of ghosts.

17:40.480 --> 17:44.023
I get so scared, I think
I may just turn as white.

17:45.395 --> 17:47.930
- And cut.

17:47.930 --> 17:49.820
Good, good, good, all right, all right.

17:49.820 --> 17:51.930
They definitely brought us
the right boy for the job.

17:51.930 --> 17:53.240
You know, this is the first time not using

17:53.240 --> 17:55.520
a white man with blackface.

17:55.520 --> 17:57.370
Think I like using a real Negro.

17:57.370 --> 17:58.540
All right, great.

17:58.540 --> 17:59.703
Next scene, okay.

18:14.980 --> 18:15.813
- Hungry?

18:23.952 --> 18:25.290
That's all right.

18:25.290 --> 18:27.350
Tell me your favorite song.

18:27.350 --> 18:28.823
- What do you think
you're doin' there, boy?

18:29.910 --> 18:32.221
- Get away from that gal.
- I ain't done nothin', sir.

18:32.221 --> 18:34.230
Just me and the girl, we're
just right here sharing a laugh.

18:34.230 --> 18:35.063
- I saw you--

18:35.063 --> 18:37.060
- I was just
sharing a piece of fruit.

18:37.060 --> 18:39.960
- You callin' me a liar, boy?

18:39.960 --> 18:41.710
- Punching a white
man would get you hung

18:41.710 --> 18:44.540
in the South, and though
I was far from home,

18:44.540 --> 18:46.660
if you stepped outta line in Hollywood,

18:46.660 --> 18:49.013
there would be somebody
to put you back in place.

18:57.530 --> 18:59.180
Like Mr. McCoy.

18:59.180 --> 19:01.440
The singer who liked
dark rum and white gals,

19:01.440 --> 19:04.108
until he was found in bed
with a producer's wife.

19:04.941 --> 19:06.270
Three days later, he was washed up

19:06.270 --> 19:07.820
on a beach with his throat cut.

19:10.110 --> 19:12.110
Then you had Lenore Carole,

19:12.110 --> 19:14.190
who was about to marry
leading man Danny Faroe

19:14.190 --> 19:16.590
until he discovered his
bride-to-be was half-black

19:16.590 --> 19:19.983
and crushed her skull with a
golf club in their living room.

19:21.471 --> 19:23.421
The judge let him go on a technicality.

19:24.580 --> 19:27.530
But I was lucky, all they
did was give me a beatin'

19:27.530 --> 19:28.780
and throw me off the lot.

19:29.750 --> 19:33.193
I had been blacklisted.

19:53.280 --> 19:54.580
- Mister, you got a light?

19:59.590 --> 20:00.423
- No.

20:01.627 --> 20:04.933
- Well, gee, it look like
somebody done stole your lunch.

20:09.040 --> 20:10.207
- Something like that.

20:11.506 --> 20:12.673
- How about...

20:13.630 --> 20:15.123
You buy Sugar a drink?

20:16.396 --> 20:19.563
And I'll help you forget all about it.

21:03.710 --> 21:06.253
- This road you're going
down is not an easy one.

21:07.300 --> 21:11.250
You have to show the
world that you are a man,

21:11.250 --> 21:16.210
and that you have the humanity
that can mirror all men.

21:16.210 --> 21:20.133
That is your job as an actor.

21:25.810 --> 21:27.003
You desire.

21:28.600 --> 21:30.253
You sacrifice.

21:32.220 --> 21:33.353
You love.

21:34.750 --> 21:35.653
You hate.

21:37.280 --> 21:38.283
You hurt.

21:39.730 --> 21:40.823
You bleed.

21:42.210 --> 21:43.313
You live.

21:45.250 --> 21:46.403
You die.

21:50.110 --> 21:54.643
Mr. Glass, would you like to
share with the class today?

22:04.720 --> 22:07.853
- We're all just here wasting
our time, and you know it.

22:09.610 --> 22:11.863
They don't care about who we are.

22:14.340 --> 22:16.090
- Mr. Glass, don't leave.

23:20.800 --> 23:22.700
- I hope you
are enjoying another cool

23:22.700 --> 23:24.790
and sunny day in California.

23:24.790 --> 23:26.810
The US Army wants you to be vigilant.

23:26.810 --> 23:29.070
Japan has spies everywhere.

23:29.070 --> 23:32.630
Remember, if you see
something, say something.

23:32.630 --> 23:35.360
In other news, don't count
on seeing Hollywood starlet

23:35.360 --> 23:38.250
Mona Lane on the streets of
Tinsel Town anytime soon.

23:38.250 --> 23:41.150
Victory Studios says she
has eloped to Mexico.

23:41.150 --> 23:43.200
No word if it's with Bo Jimmy Stance,

23:43.200 --> 23:44.823
who is she is often seen with.

23:45.700 --> 23:48.250
Support the war effort and buy bonds.

23:48.250 --> 23:49.943
- These streets are hard for a man.

23:51.310 --> 23:53.863
I thought you was gonna be
a big movie star one day.

23:56.531 --> 23:57.698
What happened?

23:59.010 --> 24:00.833
Got tired of playin' the butler?

24:03.020 --> 24:04.370
I'll tell you what, though.

24:05.840 --> 24:08.163
Everything you hear ain't true.

24:09.700 --> 24:12.423
They talkin' 'bout that
girl Mona goin' to Mexico.

24:14.530 --> 24:16.830
She ain't in no Mexico,
she got into trouble,

24:16.830 --> 24:20.863
messin' with them bad
boys down on Central.

24:22.982 --> 24:25.090
If she kidnapped, I'll eat my shoe.

24:25.090 --> 24:27.320
- Whoa, whoa, wait, wait,
wait, go back, go back.

24:27.320 --> 24:28.920
What did you just say?

24:28.920 --> 24:30.813
- I'll eat me shoe.
- No.

24:32.310 --> 24:33.210
About the actress.

24:35.320 --> 24:38.203
- That girl ain't in no Mexico.

24:39.360 --> 24:42.433
She got in a fix with some
fellas I used to know.

25:21.840 --> 25:23.400
- What's your name?

25:23.400 --> 25:24.423
- Archie Glass.

25:25.590 --> 25:27.450
- You know who I am?

25:27.450 --> 25:30.530
- You're Jack Wingate,
head of Victory Studios.

25:30.530 --> 25:31.793
I got something you want.

25:33.920 --> 25:35.370
Something you're looking for.

25:37.090 --> 25:39.590
- I told you he's some sort of nut-job.

25:39.590 --> 25:40.630
Let me bust him up some more,

25:40.630 --> 25:42.600
and I'll go throw him
down a hole in the desert.

25:42.600 --> 25:45.213
- Do that, you'll never find Mona Lane.

25:46.070 --> 25:48.840
- And what do you know about Mona Lane?

25:48.840 --> 25:51.693
- I know she's not
down in Mexico getting married.

25:56.010 --> 25:57.310
- The town talks.

25:57.310 --> 25:58.460
- It's not just gossip.

26:00.973 --> 26:03.923
And you're hiding it from the
press, but once word get out,

26:04.870 --> 26:06.020
everybody's gonna know.

26:07.821 --> 26:09.203
- And what is it that you want?

26:10.810 --> 26:11.673
- I'm an actor.

26:13.040 --> 26:15.190
Or at least I was,
until I got blacklisted.

26:16.830 --> 26:18.830
I need you to take me off the blacklist,

26:20.380 --> 26:22.130
so I can work again, or better yet,

26:23.530 --> 26:25.080
put me in one of your pictures.

26:26.130 --> 26:27.890
- Why would I wanna do that?

26:27.890 --> 26:29.440
- I can find Mona Lane for you.

26:32.260 --> 26:33.093
- Why the hell would I need you,

26:33.093 --> 26:34.833
when I have my own security staff?

26:36.090 --> 26:38.457
- Where you need to go,
these big ugly white men

26:38.457 --> 26:40.463
are gonna stick out like a sore thumb.

26:41.670 --> 26:44.460
- And where is
it that I need to go?

26:44.460 --> 26:46.660
- Down in South Los Angeles.

26:46.660 --> 26:48.760
A place I'm pretty sure you've never been.

26:51.203 --> 26:52.700
- Can you read?

26:52.700 --> 26:54.293
- Yes, sir, I can read.

26:56.490 --> 26:58.983
- This was left on
my doorstep last evening.

27:02.347 --> 27:03.500
- "If you are reading this,

27:03.500 --> 27:06.467
"then you already know
that Mona Lane is missing.

27:06.467 --> 27:08.803
"We will kill her if we don't $10,000

27:08.803 --> 27:11.047
"by the day after tomorrow.

27:11.047 --> 27:13.917
"Leave the money in a brown
paper bag at the bus stop

27:13.917 --> 27:17.507
"at Central and Jefferson,
do not delay in payment,

27:17.507 --> 27:21.961
"if you want to see her alive again."

27:23.060 --> 27:27.180
- It seems that Miss Lane got herself

27:27.180 --> 27:29.513
into trouble frequenting jazz clubs.

27:30.390 --> 27:35.293
And Miss Lane likes a
certain kind of company.

27:39.010 --> 27:40.560
- I don't follow.

27:40.560 --> 27:42.003
- She likes Negro men.

27:43.870 --> 27:48.270
Now, the studio has invested
a lot of resources and money,

27:48.270 --> 27:50.023
into the image of Mona Lane.

27:51.220 --> 27:53.323
She's one of our up and rising stars.

27:54.520 --> 27:58.160
I can't risk her image to be tarnished

27:59.120 --> 28:01.463
by people thinking that
she's a nigger lover.

28:03.810 --> 28:05.463
Do you follow me now, Mr. Glass?

28:07.190 --> 28:08.840
- Yeah.

28:08.840 --> 28:09.673
I guess I do.

28:12.001 --> 28:13.451
- If you can do what you say,

28:15.180 --> 28:16.013
I'll reward you.

28:17.520 --> 28:18.990
I'll take you off that blacklist,

28:18.990 --> 28:20.543
and I'll put you in one of my films.

28:23.718 --> 28:25.890
Now, you call when you find her,

28:25.890 --> 28:28.040
and O'Neal here will go and fetch her,

28:28.040 --> 28:30.670
before some rogue reporter with an itch

28:30.670 --> 28:32.993
to make a name for himself
can write about it.

28:34.900 --> 28:37.820
- Can I trust your word?

28:37.820 --> 28:39.773
- That's a funny thing to ask a man.

28:42.100 --> 28:43.543
Yes, you can trust me.

28:48.009 --> 28:49.159
- Then you have a deal.

28:50.680 --> 28:51.543
Just one thing.

28:52.400 --> 28:53.573
- Yeah, what's that?

28:54.790 --> 28:57.300
- Why don't you just pay the kidnappers?

28:57.300 --> 28:58.357
I'm pretty sure you can afford it,

28:58.357 --> 28:59.913
and you got plenty to spare.

29:02.790 --> 29:04.227
- Let me tell you something.

29:05.650 --> 29:08.930
I am not about to let some
hoodling gang of Negros

29:08.930 --> 29:10.863
think that they can boss me around.

29:12.000 --> 29:14.123
They won't get a wooden nickel out of me.

29:14.999 --> 29:16.599
Do you follow me now, Mr. Glass?

29:18.230 --> 29:19.063
- Yeah.

29:19.920 --> 29:20.753
I guess I do.

29:28.320 --> 29:29.153
- Glass.

29:31.280 --> 29:34.680
You find the girl, I'll deal
with the coked-up coons.

29:34.680 --> 29:38.000
- If you're so bad, why don't
you just find her yourself?

29:38.000 --> 29:40.090
- Just because the boss made
you a promise, doesn't mean

29:40.090 --> 29:42.640
I won't knock out some of
your teeth along the way.

29:43.931 --> 29:45.193
I'll be waiting for your call.

30:39.450 --> 30:40.970
Sam?

30:40.970 --> 30:41.803
Give me 10.

30:48.300 --> 30:49.300
Where have you been?

30:51.566 --> 30:53.140
You think you can just disappear on me

30:53.140 --> 30:54.833
and come back whenever you want?

30:55.800 --> 30:58.930
- I just been trying to figure
some things out, that's it.

30:58.930 --> 31:00.680
- Well why don't you go talk

31:00.680 --> 31:03.040
to your girlfriend about your problems?

31:03.040 --> 31:04.463
- I don't have a girlfriend.

31:07.625 --> 31:09.960
I mean, you're the only
one I wanna be with.

31:09.960 --> 31:12.640
I think you're my girlfriend, I mean--

31:12.640 --> 31:15.220
- You sound confused.

31:15.220 --> 31:16.563
Go get yourself a drink.

31:17.690 --> 31:19.410
- It just ain't fair what they did to me.

31:19.410 --> 31:22.410
- This world ain't fair.

31:22.410 --> 31:24.320
And you'd better get used to it.

31:24.320 --> 31:26.370
There ain't nothin' fair about this town.

31:29.161 --> 31:30.561
- I need to borrow your car.

31:31.670 --> 31:32.763
- My car?

31:34.400 --> 31:35.233
For what?

31:36.300 --> 31:39.100
- I got a chance, a second chance, really.

31:39.100 --> 31:40.513
A shot at the big time.

31:41.890 --> 31:44.650
- What are you
talkin' about, Archie?

31:44.650 --> 31:46.082
- I can't tell you everything right now,

31:46.082 --> 31:48.082
but I need to find this white gal.

31:48.082 --> 31:50.290
- A white girl?

31:50.290 --> 31:52.960
- When I was in lockup,
there was this old black Joe,

31:52.960 --> 31:55.547
and I reckon he was some
kind of actor or somethin'.

31:56.800 --> 32:01.423
'Cause at nighttime, he
would recite these plays,

32:03.461 --> 32:06.527
and I would close my eyes
and imagine all the people

32:06.527 --> 32:09.833
and the places this old
buster used to talk about.

32:12.520 --> 32:15.463
So, when time come again and I'm free,

32:17.340 --> 32:19.740
I say I'm going to Hollywood
to become an actor.

32:24.760 --> 32:25.673
That's my dream.

32:27.140 --> 32:29.650
And if findin' this white
gal for some old cracker's

32:29.650 --> 32:32.070
gonna get me closer to that
dream, then damn it all.

32:32.070 --> 32:33.300
Damn it all.

32:33.300 --> 32:34.900
Who knows?

32:34.900 --> 32:36.000
I could become a star.

32:39.380 --> 32:40.213
- A star?

32:41.301 --> 32:43.580
Now I know you're dreamin'.

32:45.100 --> 32:47.700
- I'm just asking you just
to trust me a little bit.

32:49.170 --> 32:52.560
- You are not the only one

32:52.560 --> 32:54.210
with their back against the wall.

32:55.950 --> 32:58.503
We all have hard choices
that we have to make.

33:13.350 --> 33:15.320
- I have to go.

33:15.320 --> 33:16.710
- I know.

33:16.710 --> 33:17.913
You're chasing a girl,

33:18.840 --> 33:20.990
when you have one
standing in front of you.

33:43.950 --> 33:46.070
- Nadine was a gossip hound.

33:46.070 --> 33:49.270
She knew who was sleepin'
with who, when and where.

33:49.270 --> 33:52.060
People liked tellin' her
secrets, I was hopin' that

33:52.060 --> 33:54.860
someone had whispered
in her ear about Mona.

33:54.860 --> 33:57.950
- How'd you get in here?
- The gate was unlocked.

33:57.950 --> 33:59.890
I rang the bell, but no one answered.

33:59.890 --> 34:00.840
- Who are you?

34:00.840 --> 34:03.240
- I'm Fattius Quickstep, I'm
with the Hollywood Negro Press,

34:03.240 --> 34:04.800
and I have some questions I wanna ask you

34:04.800 --> 34:06.250
about an article I'm writing.

34:07.560 --> 34:09.902
- An article!

34:12.620 --> 34:13.719
Why didn't you say so?

34:29.030 --> 34:31.489
You sayin' something
about doing a story on me?

34:31.489 --> 34:32.870
- A feature.

34:32.870 --> 34:34.330
- A feature!

34:34.330 --> 34:37.750
- Yes, we have some questions
your fans would like to know.

34:37.750 --> 34:38.583
- Go on.

34:39.830 --> 34:41.780
- What's your favorite color?
- Pink.

34:41.780 --> 34:45.943
But that's too racy, so
let's just say yellow.

34:48.280 --> 34:49.860
- What's your favorite flower?

34:49.860 --> 34:51.909
- Roses, of course.

34:51.909 --> 34:53.429
Martini?
- No, thank you.

34:53.429 --> 34:55.070
I never drink on the job.

34:55.070 --> 34:55.922
- Shame.

34:57.090 --> 34:59.273
- Who is your
favorite actor to work with?

35:01.440 --> 35:03.950
- I don't wanna get in any trouble, so,

35:03.950 --> 35:05.407
let's just say all of 'em.

35:06.280 --> 35:07.113
- That's fine.

35:08.400 --> 35:10.600
So, tell us, what do you like to do

35:10.600 --> 35:13.240
on your typical Friday night?

35:13.240 --> 35:16.450
- Well, me and my girls like to go out.

35:17.800 --> 35:19.208
Where?

35:19.208 --> 35:20.660
- Over on Central Avenue.

35:20.660 --> 35:22.670
Dun Bar Hotel.

35:22.670 --> 35:24.183
That place really swings.

35:27.269 --> 35:30.720
- You've been seen with
your gal pal, Mona Lane.

35:30.720 --> 35:33.140
Tell us about you guys' friendship.

35:33.140 --> 35:34.960
- I met Mona on a night out.

35:34.960 --> 35:38.763
She likes jazz and so do
I, so we hit it off fine.

35:42.230 --> 35:45.700
- Mona Lane has not been
seen out on the town lately.

35:45.700 --> 35:47.450
Do you happen to know where she is?

35:48.380 --> 35:51.280
- Say, I thought this story
was supposed to be about me.

35:51.280 --> 35:53.040
- It is, Miss Lomax.

35:53.040 --> 35:55.830
We just have to answer
questions for our readers.

35:55.830 --> 35:57.420
- You're no reporter.

35:57.420 --> 36:00.120
Hey, didn't you used to work
the door down at Dun Bar?

36:03.460 --> 36:04.293
- Okay.

36:05.840 --> 36:07.353
I'm gonna shoot it to you straight.

36:08.850 --> 36:11.780
Mona Lane's gone missing,
I've been hired to find her.

36:11.780 --> 36:13.400
- Missing?

36:13.400 --> 36:15.073
- We believe she's been kidnapped.

36:15.940 --> 36:17.843
- Who's "we?"
- The studio.

36:19.000 --> 36:22.233
- The studio hired a nigga
to find a white girl?

36:24.200 --> 36:26.330
- They think she's been
kidnapped by a trumpet player

36:26.330 --> 36:27.993
that plays down on Central Av.

36:29.689 --> 36:31.383
I thought you might
know something about it.

36:32.620 --> 36:33.763
- You're kinda cute.

36:35.490 --> 36:37.693
I'll tell you what you
wanna know for a kiss.

36:55.670 --> 36:56.503
- So...

36:58.820 --> 37:01.423
This trumpet player, what's his name?

37:03.620 --> 37:05.270
- Tweet Jackson.

37:05.270 --> 37:06.333
That's his name.

37:06.333 --> 37:08.630
He's from somewhere back east, but,

37:08.630 --> 37:10.230
who the hell isn't in this town?

37:11.530 --> 37:13.230
- That's all you know about him?

37:13.230 --> 37:14.180
Where does he live?

37:17.230 --> 37:19.653
- You wanna know more,
Mr. Fattius Quickstep,

37:21.310 --> 37:23.393
you're gonna have to
meet me in my bedroom.

37:51.290 --> 37:53.693
All I know is that he
play that horn so well,

37:54.540 --> 37:56.340
it's like he put a spell on a woman.

37:57.190 --> 37:59.090
He run with a rough crowd, though, so,

38:00.150 --> 38:04.700
he plays an angel, but he's
still a nigga from the street.

38:04.700 --> 38:06.037
- Is that all you got?

38:23.252 --> 38:24.252
- For you...

38:25.780 --> 38:27.050
I got a lot more.

38:43.320 --> 38:44.533
Come on, mister.

38:46.880 --> 38:49.083
Everybody want me to make them laugh,

38:50.290 --> 38:53.120
and make them forget about they troubles,

38:53.120 --> 38:56.163
forget about they pain in
life, but what about me?

38:58.760 --> 39:00.163
I need somethin', too.

39:04.113 --> 39:05.800
I need to feel good, too.

39:21.120 --> 39:22.570
- Mona!

39:22.570 --> 39:24.101
- Who is that?

39:24.101 --> 39:24.934
- Mona!

39:24.934 --> 39:28.230
- Sounds like Jimmy Stance.

39:28.230 --> 39:31.070
He got a crush on Mona somethin' bad.

39:31.070 --> 39:34.810
The studio set 'em up on a
date, just for publicity.

39:34.810 --> 39:37.620
Ever since then, he thinks
Mona's really his girl.

39:37.620 --> 39:39.120
- Why the hell he come here?

39:39.120 --> 39:41.275
- He been lookin' all over town for her.

39:41.275 --> 39:42.421
- Hey, Mona?

39:42.421 --> 39:43.640
- I guess he finally made it here.

39:43.640 --> 39:45.553
The boy's in love, I guess.

39:46.430 --> 39:47.580
- He must have really fallen for her.

39:47.580 --> 39:48.413
- Mona?

39:49.840 --> 39:52.670
- I don't have the heart to
tell him that it's not real.

39:52.670 --> 39:53.503
- Well you better tell him somethin',

39:53.503 --> 39:55.630
before he knock your gate down.

39:55.630 --> 39:58.646
- Mona, are you in here?
- Please do somethin'.

39:59.850 --> 40:00.683
- Mona.

40:02.880 --> 40:03.713
Mona.

40:05.456 --> 40:07.343
Hey, where is she, where's my Mona?

40:08.570 --> 40:09.880
I know you know where she is.

40:09.880 --> 40:11.453
- She ain't here.

40:14.835 --> 40:18.070
- I don't believe you,
and you know what, boy?

40:18.070 --> 40:20.163
I'm not gonna leave until I find her.

40:21.300 --> 40:22.133
- Suit yourself.

40:32.680 --> 40:36.210
I left Nadine's house no
better off than when I came in.

40:36.210 --> 40:39.760
Strike one, I had aimed high and missed.

40:39.760 --> 40:41.900
Now it was time to aim low.

40:41.900 --> 40:43.390
Blackie Philips was an old actor

40:43.390 --> 40:45.300
who came up through Vaudeville.

40:45.300 --> 40:47.980
He played every type of song
and dance you could think of.

40:47.980 --> 40:50.420
In his day, he had starred
in over a dozen movies.

40:50.420 --> 40:53.540
But when his knees went bad
and he couldn't dance no more,

40:53.540 --> 40:55.620
his Hollywood career was over.

40:55.620 --> 40:57.700
Now in his old age, he
kept a quiet card game

40:57.700 --> 40:59.900
in the back of his house
behind the kitchen.

41:00.760 --> 41:02.966
- The only way I know to make
some real money in this world

41:02.966 --> 41:05.930
is workin' on them trains, being a porter.

41:05.930 --> 41:06.830
That's good money.

41:09.110 --> 41:11.950
- I'd rather be a porter
in pictures than to be one.

41:11.950 --> 41:14.900
Them white boys want a
man to bend over too much.

41:14.900 --> 41:16.840
- Hell, I've been in 15 pictures.

41:16.840 --> 41:20.140
Been a busboy, a shoeshine
boy, a train porter.

41:20.140 --> 41:22.237
Don't matter the part, I
always say the same thing.

41:22.237 --> 41:23.567
"Yes, sir, boss.

41:23.567 --> 41:25.137
"You sure is right, boss.

41:25.137 --> 41:27.745
"I don't know, whatever you say, boss."

41:27.745 --> 41:29.600
- Cut the shit and give me a card.

41:29.600 --> 41:31.493
- I've been in all three Tarzan movies,

41:31.493 --> 41:33.840
and all I ever say is, "ooga booga booga."

41:33.840 --> 41:35.760
But me, I don't care.

41:35.760 --> 41:37.693
Damn monkey get more lines than I do.

41:37.693 --> 41:39.540
As long as they pay me
at the end of the day.

41:39.540 --> 41:40.980
- Just make sure they
don't pay you in bananas.

41:40.980 --> 41:43.130
'Cause you know, if
they could, they would.

41:45.230 --> 41:49.010
- Damn, must be exciting
being in the pictures.

41:49.010 --> 41:51.740
You fellas get to be right
there with the movie stars.

41:51.740 --> 41:55.640
Tell me, what is it like
workin' with James Cagney?

41:55.640 --> 41:56.730
- Cagney?

41:56.730 --> 41:57.900
Yeah, he's all right.

41:57.900 --> 41:59.200
Sold him some reefer once.

42:00.740 --> 42:02.850
- Where'd you say you was from again?

42:02.850 --> 42:05.800
- Just got off the bus from
Walla Walla, Washington.

42:05.800 --> 42:07.870
Thought I'd see the ocean before I die.

42:07.870 --> 42:10.500
- How'd you hear about our card game here?

42:10.500 --> 42:13.270
Somebody in Walla Walla
must have a big mouth.

42:13.270 --> 42:17.180
- No, fella I met named
Tweet, forgot his last name.

42:17.180 --> 42:20.550
Jackson, that's it, Tweet Jackson.

42:20.550 --> 42:22.470
Man say he play the horn.

42:22.470 --> 42:24.530
Told me about this here card game.

42:24.530 --> 42:26.270
Thought I'd try my luck.

42:26.270 --> 42:29.473
- Yeah, well, your luck
ain't so good today.

42:37.284 --> 42:39.540
- How about this horn
player, Tweet Jackson?

42:39.540 --> 42:41.240
You fellas know where to find him?

42:42.540 --> 42:44.940
- You ask questions make people nervous.

42:44.940 --> 42:47.200
You sound like the police.

42:47.200 --> 42:50.480
- Just that he owe me money
from a pool game, that's all.

42:50.480 --> 42:51.313
- That right?

42:52.430 --> 42:55.420
- I beat him three games
out of five, last Tuesday.

42:55.420 --> 42:57.140
He owe me £23.

42:57.140 --> 42:57.973
- That's a lie.

42:57.973 --> 43:01.190
Tweet Jackson wouldn't be
there last Tuesday, all day.

43:01.190 --> 43:03.600
- Then it must Wednesday I'm
thinkin' of, yeah.

43:03.600 --> 43:04.763
- Try again, mister.

43:05.615 --> 43:07.490
- Aw, hell, I don't know what day it was.

43:07.490 --> 43:09.620
I just know the nigga owe me money.

43:09.620 --> 43:12.630
- Cut the bullshit, motherfucker,
who the fuck are you?

43:12.630 --> 43:13.800
And don't tell me no tales,

43:13.800 --> 43:16.724
'cause you might just
get your face blown off.

43:16.724 --> 43:18.113
- So you don't blow me face off.

43:19.610 --> 43:20.610
- Let him go, Slick.

43:22.500 --> 43:24.287
I ain't never had no
man killed here before,

43:24.287 --> 43:25.913
and I ain't gonna start now.

43:26.980 --> 43:29.113
I keep a nice quiet card game.

43:30.250 --> 43:32.900
The last man who got shot
in my place was shot by me.

43:34.890 --> 43:37.823
So, mister, you got some place to be,

43:38.660 --> 43:40.410
I'd be gettin' there, if I was you.

43:42.300 --> 43:43.133
- I'll leave.

43:45.770 --> 43:47.370
I just need a question answered.

43:49.680 --> 43:51.080
Have you seen Tweet Jackson?

43:52.610 --> 43:54.163
- You want somethin' from me?

43:55.010 --> 43:57.520
This world turns off
everybody gettin' a piece.

43:57.520 --> 43:58.370
I gotta eat, too.

44:11.783 --> 44:14.903
The last time I seen
Tweet, he was talkin' about

44:14.903 --> 44:18.180
makin' some money, said he had
to go meet some white broad.

44:18.180 --> 44:19.313
He was acting crazy.

44:20.190 --> 44:22.293
- This white broad, you ever see her?

44:23.700 --> 44:25.730
- Yeah, this one time, she
was in the car with him.

44:25.730 --> 44:28.443
Saw her from the across the
street, she didn't get out.

44:31.390 --> 44:32.223
- This her?

44:33.350 --> 44:34.630
- Yeah, that's her.

44:34.630 --> 44:36.753
Pretty as hell, look like a movie star.

44:38.940 --> 44:41.763
- Where Tweet stay at?
- I done said enough.

44:44.470 --> 44:47.200
All right, he always

44:47.200 --> 44:49.330
at the Cadillac Club playin' pool.

44:49.330 --> 44:51.063
- Horn player, what horn player?

44:52.130 --> 44:53.393
- Nigga named Booker.

44:54.290 --> 44:56.343
He got a process and always wear yellow.

44:57.400 --> 44:58.720
- The Cadillac Club?

44:58.720 --> 45:00.370
- Yeah, that's all I know.

45:02.220 --> 45:04.238
- Mister Walla Walla?

45:05.490 --> 45:07.360
- Your time is up.

45:07.360 --> 45:08.779
You got to go.

45:21.166 --> 45:24.370
- See y'all in the funny papers.

45:24.370 --> 45:25.570
Where Tweet stay at?

45:25.570 --> 45:27.380
- He always

45:29.370 --> 45:31.710
- What horn player?
- Nigga named Booker.

45:31.710 --> 45:34.027
He got a process and always wear yellow.

46:04.590 --> 46:05.850
- What you following me for?

46:05.850 --> 46:07.550
- Hey, I'm Archie Glass.

46:07.550 --> 46:08.670
- Nigga, I don't know you.

46:08.670 --> 46:11.660
- Yes, well, I'm with the
Samwel Insurance Company.

46:11.660 --> 46:12.493
- Insurance?

46:12.493 --> 46:14.820
- Yes, I'm in charge of
finding family members who have

46:14.820 --> 46:17.240
money coming to them from
recently-deceased relatives.

46:17.240 --> 46:18.660
- What the hell are
you talkin' about, man?

46:18.660 --> 46:21.020
- I'm talkin' about a check, a check,

46:21.020 --> 46:24.290
which I'm tryin' to put into
the hands of one Tweet Jackson.

46:24.290 --> 46:27.490
You see, Mr. Jackson's Aunt
Buttercup has passed and she

46:27.490 --> 46:30.530
left him some money from an
insurance policy she took out.

46:30.530 --> 46:33.560
So, you see, I'm tryin'
to find Tweet Jackson.

46:33.560 --> 46:35.050
- A check?

46:35.050 --> 46:35.887
How much?

46:35.887 --> 46:39.800
- $300, to which I'm able
to pay a finder's fee

46:39.800 --> 46:42.650
to anyone that can help
me find Mr. Jackson.

46:42.650 --> 46:45.060
We're tryin' to get matters off our books.

46:45.060 --> 46:46.210
The sooner, the better.

46:47.512 --> 46:50.523
- I don't know, you don't
look no insurance man to me.

46:51.870 --> 46:53.320
- Tell me where Mr. Jackson is,

46:53.320 --> 46:55.573
and you will receive a finder's fee of $5.

46:57.112 --> 46:59.780
- Shit, I make more than that giggin'

46:59.780 --> 47:02.130
at the Coconut Grove in one night!

47:02.130 --> 47:03.190
What's the name of the insurance company

47:03.190 --> 47:04.240
you say you work for?

47:05.210 --> 47:06.840
- Archwell.

47:06.840 --> 47:07.673
Doberman.

47:09.030 --> 47:10.280
- You lyin' motherfucker.

47:14.670 --> 47:15.920
- Where can I find Tweet?

47:16.931 --> 47:18.571
- I ain't no rat!

47:18.571 --> 47:19.633
- You play horn, right?

47:21.750 --> 47:24.340
How you gonna play horn with a busted lip?

47:24.340 --> 47:25.420
- All right, all right!

47:25.420 --> 47:28.420
There's a walk up at Hoover
Street, over the liquor store.

47:28.420 --> 47:29.570
You can find him there.

47:54.910 --> 47:57.020
- Pow, pow.

47:57.020 --> 47:58.050
Pow, pow.

48:31.650 --> 48:33.210
Pow, pow.

48:33.210 --> 48:35.320
Pow, got you, mister.

48:35.320 --> 48:36.520
- Hey, kid.

48:36.520 --> 48:38.837
You see the man that live
in the apartment up there?

48:38.837 --> 48:40.840
- No, but I see a lot of people

48:40.840 --> 48:44.998
go in and out of a garage in the back.

48:44.998 --> 48:46.280
- Thanks, kid.

49:19.940 --> 49:20.773
Fuck.

49:20.773 --> 49:22.000
- Where is she?

49:22.000 --> 49:23.423
Where is she?

49:24.500 --> 49:27.250
- Who're you talkin' about?
- Mona, damn it, where is she?

49:27.250 --> 49:28.710
You know, I asked around,

49:28.710 --> 49:30.773
until somebody told me that she come here.

49:31.890 --> 49:33.883
Now, why would she come here?

49:35.270 --> 49:37.860
Why would my Mona do that to me?

49:37.860 --> 49:41.277
- Look, man, I don't know
nothin' what you talkin' about.

49:41.277 --> 49:42.427
But you should ask him.

49:43.920 --> 49:45.401
- Who's he?

49:45.401 --> 49:46.900
- I don't know, he ain't talking.

49:46.900 --> 49:49.070
- No, something's goin' on here, man.

49:49.070 --> 49:52.333
Somethin' that somebody ain't telling me!

49:53.500 --> 49:55.923
You know, Mona's my girl, my girl!

49:56.780 --> 50:00.720
And I love her and you
better tell me where she is,

50:00.720 --> 50:04.063
right now, or you're gonna
end up just as dead as he is!

50:05.780 --> 50:07.080
Better start talking, boy.

50:08.030 --> 50:10.393
You better start talk...

50:24.860 --> 50:25.710
- Thanks, mister.

50:27.350 --> 50:29.410
- You're lucky I'm a nosy reporter.

50:29.410 --> 50:30.930
If I hadn't got a lead
on where Mona Lane likes

50:30.930 --> 50:33.823
to hang her stockings, you
might be dead as Dillinger.

50:35.989 --> 50:38.360
- A reporter, like for the paper?

50:38.360 --> 50:40.440
- Skip Slater with the LA Trumpet.

50:40.440 --> 50:42.763
Snoopin' around tryin'
to get a lead on a story.

50:45.114 --> 50:46.064
- What kinda story?

50:48.040 --> 50:51.420
- Listen, bother, I'm
hip to what's goin' on.

50:51.420 --> 50:53.290
I may not know everything,

50:53.290 --> 50:55.780
but I know Mona Lane isn't in Mexico.

50:55.780 --> 50:58.750
And she hasn't been in her
penthouse for the last three days

50:58.750 --> 51:00.100
so where is she?

51:00.100 --> 51:01.210
- Look, I'm gonna tell you

51:01.210 --> 51:03.923
the same thing I told
loverboy here, I don't know.

51:05.660 --> 51:07.664
- Well, who are you then?

51:07.664 --> 51:09.320
What're you doin' here?

51:09.320 --> 51:10.923
- I was hired to find Mona.

51:11.920 --> 51:13.860
Seems like we all lookin'
for the same person.

51:13.860 --> 51:15.340
- Well, half of Hollywood
knows she's got the hots

51:15.340 --> 51:16.880
for colored jazz players.

51:16.880 --> 51:19.420
If an idiot like this guy
can figure it out, you know

51:19.420 --> 51:22.290
the rest of Tinsel Town will
soon be figuring out, too.

51:22.290 --> 51:24.730
I'm just tryin' to get ahead
of the story, you know?

51:24.730 --> 51:25.563
Get the scoop.

51:27.920 --> 51:30.120
- Looks like we all
come to a dead-end?

51:32.840 --> 51:34.537
- I know you're not telling me somethin'.

51:35.552 --> 51:38.253
But if you change your
mind, here's my number.

51:39.350 --> 51:41.150
Give me a call with some info,

51:41.150 --> 51:42.650
I'll make it worth your while.

51:48.330 --> 51:49.163
- Hey.

51:50.400 --> 51:51.450
What about these two?

51:52.900 --> 51:54.540
- Well, one's dead,

51:54.540 --> 51:56.690
the other's gonna come
to in a few minutes,

51:57.800 --> 51:59.600
and I wouldn't be here when he does.

52:12.570 --> 52:15.333
- Nadine say Mona liked to
look at famous dead folk.

52:16.450 --> 52:17.900
I figure I had nothin' to lose

52:17.900 --> 52:19.860
by killin' an hour at the local cemetery

52:19.860 --> 52:22.433
with dead movie stars
layin' next to their fans.

52:51.260 --> 52:52.093
Mona?

52:53.830 --> 52:54.780
- I don't know you.

53:00.750 --> 53:01.703
- You Archie Glass?

53:02.990 --> 53:05.727
- Maybe, depends on who wants to know.

53:05.727 --> 53:07.676
- Somebody wants to see you.

53:07.676 --> 53:10.486
- Hey, I don't owe you
fellas any money, do I?

53:21.400 --> 53:22.583
No, no.

53:28.649 --> 53:31.660
- The world does not see you as a man.

53:31.660 --> 53:33.603
Hollywood does not see you as a man.

53:35.430 --> 53:38.933
That's why they call you boy, and son.

53:39.940 --> 53:43.643
They tell you to bug out your
eyes and stick your lips out.

53:44.820 --> 53:45.970
See, they don't think you have a heart,

53:45.970 --> 53:47.320
or that you're intelligent.

53:48.490 --> 53:50.660
That your soul is the soul of God.

53:50.660 --> 53:54.010
- Cut the sermon, preach, why am I here?

53:54.010 --> 53:57.193
- You are here because you
are working for the enemy.

53:58.380 --> 54:00.233
- I'm workin' for Jack Wingate.

54:02.390 --> 54:04.973
- As I said,
public enemy number one.

54:06.740 --> 54:08.090
- What's all of this about?

54:10.830 --> 54:13.633
- I am the leader of the
United Negro Movie Coaliltion,

54:14.580 --> 54:16.423
and we want you to join us.

54:16.423 --> 54:19.580
- You got a hell of a way
of recruitin' a fella.

54:19.580 --> 54:22.173
- Well, it's a rough world
out there, Mr. Glass, and,

54:22.173 --> 54:24.363
a man must meet force with force.

54:26.520 --> 54:28.771
There's a revolution goin' on,

54:28.771 --> 54:31.760
and every black man must
stand up for himself.

54:31.760 --> 54:35.430
You cannot fight these Jim
Crow laws in these streets

54:35.430 --> 54:37.333
bein' a buffoon on that movie screen.

54:38.520 --> 54:41.483
Come and join us and
help us change Hollywood.

54:42.569 --> 54:43.680
- How're you gonna do that?

54:43.680 --> 54:46.653
You ain't nothing but a
bunch of angry church folk!

54:48.390 --> 54:52.040
- We have power, and if we boycott,

54:52.040 --> 54:55.710
and organize, we can bring
this town to its knees.

54:55.710 --> 54:58.140
- Boycott?

54:58.140 --> 55:01.387
Nobody's gonna do that.

55:01.387 --> 55:04.413
You're a fool, preach, you're a fool.

55:05.590 --> 55:07.993
- Well, I'm sorry to hear you think so.

55:09.440 --> 55:10.990
What kind of black man are you?

55:12.598 --> 55:15.103
- I'm not a black man, just a man.

55:27.699 --> 55:29.200
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

55:29.200 --> 55:31.083
Hey, I've already been circumcised!

55:32.340 --> 55:34.303
- Every revolution needs some blood.

55:38.100 --> 55:39.830
- I was gettin' nowhere fast.

55:39.830 --> 55:41.460
Time to check in with O'Neal.

55:41.460 --> 55:44.303
I gave him a call from a
payphone at Pico and Olympic.

55:45.970 --> 55:48.830
- Glass, where the hell have you been?

55:48.830 --> 55:51.300
You were supposed to check in
with me over three hours ago.

55:51.300 --> 55:52.333
- This ain't like goin'
around a country club,

55:52.333 --> 55:54.063
askin' for a tennis partner.

55:55.240 --> 55:57.010
- Watch your lip, boy.

55:57.010 --> 55:58.660
- Don't call me boy.

55:58.660 --> 56:00.810
- I've had about enough
of your mouth, boy.

56:13.090 --> 56:14.390
Now, tell me what you got.

56:15.740 --> 56:17.880
- Right now, nothin'.

56:17.880 --> 56:20.870
Just a dead body and whole bunch of people

56:20.870 --> 56:23.000
stickin' guns and knives in my face.

56:23.000 --> 56:24.610
- Well, that ain't enough.

56:24.610 --> 56:26.480
Let me remind you we're on a deadline.

56:26.480 --> 56:28.960
The tabloids are gonna be
on this in a day or so.

56:28.960 --> 56:30.150
- Hey, that's another thing.

56:30.150 --> 56:32.190
I've been goin' around here,
knockin' on people doors,

56:32.190 --> 56:34.550
which nothin' to back me but just a smile.

56:34.550 --> 56:35.700
I need some protection.

56:37.030 --> 56:38.700
- What the hell did you just say?

56:38.700 --> 56:39.693
- I need a gun.

56:42.360 --> 56:44.080
- As a white man,
the last thing you ever

56:44.080 --> 56:45.880
wanted to do was give a nigga a gun.

56:47.150 --> 56:49.610
It was against everything he stood for,

56:49.610 --> 56:53.460
but Jack Wingate was on his
ass just like he was on mine.

56:53.460 --> 56:56.360
- Do you know how to use it?
- Hey, don't worry about me.

56:57.290 --> 56:59.730
Just be ready next time I call you.

56:59.730 --> 57:01.663
I headed south then east to Englewood.

57:02.770 --> 57:04.773
I was on my way to see Ennis Matthews.

57:24.780 --> 57:25.613
- Archie?

57:31.946 --> 57:33.530
How do you know where I live?

57:33.530 --> 57:36.540
- You brag about this place
all the time at the club.

57:36.540 --> 57:37.963
It wasn't too hard to find.

57:39.050 --> 57:41.400
- I'm sorry I pulled the pistol on you.

57:41.400 --> 57:43.637
I thought you were one of
the neighbors come a-callin'.

57:48.610 --> 57:51.190
- What you doin' in the dark, Ennis?

57:51.190 --> 57:52.340
Your lights don't work?

57:53.280 --> 57:54.453
- They work fine.

57:55.670 --> 57:57.570
But I just keep 'em off just the same.

57:58.410 --> 58:00.010
That way, they can't see inside.

58:02.615 --> 58:04.725
I've been havin' some troubles.

58:04.725 --> 58:05.953
- What kinda troubles?

58:08.480 --> 58:11.790
- When I bought this house,
the man told me all about

58:11.790 --> 58:13.923
the wonderful friendly neighbors.

58:15.210 --> 58:18.270
I reckon they ain't so friendly
when a colored man moves in.

58:18.270 --> 58:22.370
And I've had rocks
thrown through my window.

58:22.370 --> 58:26.253
Mean letters put in my
mailbox, and my wife,

58:27.407 --> 58:29.880
she took my boys back to New Orleans,

58:29.880 --> 58:31.180
after they killed the dog.

58:34.520 --> 58:35.770
So, I bought this pistol.

58:39.030 --> 58:40.483
I saved every cent I had,

58:42.750 --> 58:43.983
to buy this house.

58:50.430 --> 58:52.030
- I'm lookin' for a girl, Ennis.

58:55.510 --> 58:56.410
- Ain't none here.

58:59.520 --> 59:00.770
- You heard of Mona Lane?

59:02.710 --> 59:03.760
She's been kidnapped,

59:05.695 --> 59:08.333
by some trumpet-playin'
Negro named Tweet Jackson.

59:12.010 --> 59:14.640
What were you doin' at Tweet's
apartment today, Ennis?

59:14.640 --> 59:18.157
- What're you talkin' about?

59:18.157 --> 59:20.370
- You're the only Negro I know

59:20.370 --> 59:23.253
that can afford to smoke
these fancy Cuban cigars.

59:24.720 --> 59:27.040
- You're crazy,
plenty of folk smoke 'em.

59:27.040 --> 59:28.230
- Yeah?

59:28.230 --> 59:30.660
Well, that pistol you got in
your hand is missin' a bullet.

59:30.660 --> 59:32.110
And I bet it's the same bullet

59:32.110 --> 59:34.160
that was in that dead body I found today.

59:41.870 --> 59:43.355
- I broke.

59:45.260 --> 59:47.043
As soon as I bought this house,

59:48.116 --> 59:50.343
the studio cut my contract.

59:52.160 --> 59:53.360
- Tell me what happened.

59:59.490 --> 01:00:00.890
- Some folks came to see me.

01:00:02.180 --> 01:00:06.193
Said, they needed
someone to pick her up.

01:00:07.720 --> 01:00:09.263
She knew me from the studio.

01:00:10.510 --> 01:00:13.360
They needed someone that she
would feel comfortable with.

01:00:15.040 --> 01:00:20.040
They said it would be big
money when it was over.

01:00:20.330 --> 01:00:23.163
So, I took her over to
the apartment on Hoover.

01:00:25.030 --> 01:00:26.063
- Tweet's apartment.

01:00:28.170 --> 01:00:30.103
- When we got there, Tweet was missing.

01:00:33.813 --> 01:00:36.347
There was an argument
about what to do next.

01:00:37.590 --> 01:00:42.123
Someone pulled a gun, I
had mine, fired first.

01:00:45.340 --> 01:00:47.443
When I got up, Mona was gone.

01:00:49.192 --> 01:00:51.823
I just, I just hauled ass outta there.

01:00:54.960 --> 01:00:55.917
- Who hired you?

01:00:59.341 --> 01:01:01.508
- It don't matter, Archie.

01:01:02.410 --> 01:01:03.310
They beat me, man.

01:01:06.180 --> 01:01:09.430
When I was a boy in New Orleans,
there was this restaurant

01:01:09.430 --> 01:01:11.880
that all the white folks would go to.

01:01:11.880 --> 01:01:15.170
It was real nice,
Archie, I mean real nice.

01:01:15.170 --> 01:01:18.900
They had candles on the table, man.

01:01:18.900 --> 01:01:22.033
There was fancy, fancy
pictures on the wall.

01:01:25.901 --> 01:01:28.547
They had this man who stood at the door.

01:01:30.602 --> 01:01:31.793
With a brown paper bag.

01:01:33.380 --> 01:01:37.333
He'd hold it up, and if you
were darker than the bag,

01:01:39.480 --> 01:01:40.480
you couldn't get in.

01:01:44.440 --> 01:01:49.063
I promised myself I'd get into that place.

01:01:54.241 --> 01:01:58.513
But now I know that no matter how rich,

01:01:59.400 --> 01:02:02.603
or famous I get,

01:02:05.221 --> 01:02:07.641
they ain't lettin' me in.

01:02:10.557 --> 01:02:13.580
- Just tell me what
happened, I gotta know.

01:02:21.781 --> 01:02:25.698
- You can't help me,
Archie, can't nobody help.

01:02:26.601 --> 01:02:27.870
- Ennis, no!

01:02:37.350 --> 01:02:39.353
Ennis was somebody I looked up to.

01:02:40.612 --> 01:02:43.353
The truth was, I wanted
to be just like him.

01:02:45.040 --> 01:02:47.863
Whatever secret he had,
he took with him to hell.

01:02:51.900 --> 01:02:54.490
I thought about Ennis's neighbors
havin' to wash the blood

01:02:54.490 --> 01:02:58.167
off his walls, but it didn't
make me feel any better.

01:03:15.870 --> 01:03:17.580
- I was talkin' to this
girl at the bar last night.

01:03:17.580 --> 01:03:18.903
Skinny girl from Alabama.

01:03:19.933 --> 01:03:23.005
She had on these glasses
and hair in a little bun,

01:03:23.005 --> 01:03:24.055
like a little poodle.

01:03:25.540 --> 01:03:28.470
I was waitin' for her to bark,
so I could buy her a drink.

01:03:28.470 --> 01:03:30.645
Then I remembered I had
a bone in my pocket.

01:03:32.200 --> 01:03:36.030
That's a cheap date out here
in California.

01:03:36.864 --> 01:03:37.933
- Whatever it is,

01:03:38.890 --> 01:03:40.113
it's gonna be all right.

01:03:45.155 --> 01:03:49.890
- I'm just tryin' to be
somebody, be a good man.

01:03:49.890 --> 01:03:52.313
- You are a good man, Archie.

01:03:54.633 --> 01:03:57.033
It's just, you're chasing a dream,

01:03:59.013 --> 01:04:01.183
when the best thing in life
is right in front of you.

01:04:05.613 --> 01:04:07.196
I gotta go to work.

01:04:25.004 --> 01:04:29.671
- Look like you're havin' a
rough time there, young bud.

01:04:32.825 --> 01:04:35.625
You know about the three seats
of power in this country?

01:04:36.910 --> 01:04:37.743
There's three.

01:04:38.950 --> 01:04:41.743
You got Wall Street, controls the money.

01:04:44.090 --> 01:04:47.223
You got the White House,
controls the military.

01:04:49.510 --> 01:04:52.523
And you got those who control our images.

01:04:54.687 --> 01:04:57.617
You know who controls the image?

01:04:57.617 --> 01:04:58.450
Hollywood.

01:05:00.036 --> 01:05:03.536
That's who controls your image, young bud.

01:05:08.870 --> 01:05:13.240
- My man, Archie Glass.

01:05:13.240 --> 01:05:15.554
How Hollywood treatin' you, baby?

01:05:15.554 --> 01:05:16.727
- Not good.

01:05:16.727 --> 01:05:19.330
But I'm still on my feet, you?

01:05:19.330 --> 01:05:21.470
- Man, you know me, just giggin' around.

01:05:21.470 --> 01:05:23.430
Was up in San Francisco last week.

01:05:23.430 --> 01:05:25.640
Tomorrow, down in San Diego.

01:05:25.640 --> 01:05:28.170
Tryin' to stay two steps
ahead of that devil.

01:05:28.170 --> 01:05:30.280
- Well, you better stay
the hell away from me,

01:05:30.280 --> 01:05:33.797
'cause he's nippin' at my ass.

01:05:35.100 --> 01:05:37.833
- Archie, I heard
you lookin' for Mona Lane.

01:05:39.450 --> 01:05:40.530
- Yeah?

01:05:40.530 --> 01:05:41.630
What about it?

01:05:41.630 --> 01:05:46.174
- Man, I saw her in the back
room and she is messed up.

01:05:46.174 --> 01:05:47.503
At least, she looks that way.

01:05:51.890 --> 01:05:52.973
Archie Glass.

01:06:05.965 --> 01:06:08.924
- She was a dead ringer for Mona.

01:06:08.924 --> 01:06:12.005
I know she had something
to do with all of this.

01:06:14.095 --> 01:06:16.580
- A lot of people think I look like her.

01:06:16.580 --> 01:06:17.413
- Where is she?

01:06:20.415 --> 01:06:21.740
- He tried to kill me.

01:06:21.740 --> 01:06:23.405
- Who?

01:06:23.405 --> 01:06:24.605
- I don't know his name.

01:06:26.080 --> 01:06:29.963
Just some fella I met last
week at the High Hat Bar.

01:06:30.950 --> 01:06:32.950
He wasn't as good-lookin' as you, daddy.

01:06:35.490 --> 01:06:36.390
- What did he say?

01:06:37.560 --> 01:06:40.560
- Said we were goin' to his
friend's place, score some junk.

01:06:41.730 --> 01:06:43.663
- What happened
when you got there?

01:06:45.063 --> 01:06:48.663
- There was nobody there.

01:06:48.663 --> 01:06:49.913
No friend, no junk.

01:06:52.590 --> 01:06:54.840
Then he took a gun out
and tried to shoot me.

01:06:56.594 --> 01:06:59.680
I bit him on the hand
and got out of there.

01:06:59.680 --> 01:07:02.380
- This man that tried to
kill you, where does he live?

01:07:04.040 --> 01:07:05.453
- Took me into a house.

01:07:07.450 --> 01:07:09.303
In Venice, close to the water.

01:07:11.720 --> 01:07:13.933
Yeah, it had red shutters.

01:07:15.237 --> 01:07:19.473
And a round window on the front door.

01:07:20.580 --> 01:07:21.413
Like a ship.

01:07:34.690 --> 01:07:35.890
- What you want, mister?

01:07:37.660 --> 01:07:38.610
- Evenin', brother.

01:07:39.810 --> 01:07:42.060
I'm Deacon Lovechild from the most holy

01:07:42.060 --> 01:07:44.210
First Baptist Church of Compton.

01:07:44.210 --> 01:07:45.170
Sorry to bother you.

01:07:45.170 --> 01:07:48.690
I know you must have been
helping yourself to some dinner,

01:07:48.690 --> 01:07:51.653
but I wanna talk to you
about the lord Jehovah.

01:07:53.280 --> 01:07:55.577
- I don't know nothin' about that!

01:07:55.577 --> 01:07:59.060
- I just wanna save your soul, brother.

01:07:59.060 --> 01:08:01.097
- My soul don't need no savin',

01:08:02.050 --> 01:08:04.500
but y'all's might, if you
don't get off my porch!

01:08:07.460 --> 01:08:11.690
- Perhaps it'd be better if I
talked to lady of the house?

01:08:11.690 --> 01:08:13.140
- Perhaps if you don't
get the hell outta here,

01:08:13.140 --> 01:08:14.163
before you get hurt.

01:08:36.810 --> 01:08:39.000
- O'Neal, it's me.
- Glass.

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.300
Damn it, where the hell have you been?

01:08:41.300 --> 01:08:43.960
- Shut up and listen, I'm
standin' across the street

01:08:43.960 --> 01:08:47.430
from a house in Venice on Pacific Avenue.

01:08:47.430 --> 01:08:50.439
I think Mona's on the inside.
- Are you sure?

01:08:50.439 --> 01:08:52.069
- No, I'm not sure.

01:08:52.069 --> 01:08:55.850
But I tried to get a look on
the inside, I didn't see much.

01:08:55.850 --> 01:08:58.580
You better get down here
now before they leave.

01:08:58.580 --> 01:09:00.479
- Don't let
them out of your sight.

01:09:00.479 --> 01:09:02.950
I don't care what Wingate
may have promised you.

01:09:02.950 --> 01:09:06.149
If you let them get away,
I will bust you up bad.

01:09:06.149 --> 01:09:07.633
I'll put you under the jail.

01:09:21.270 --> 01:09:22.120
- Hello?

01:09:24.580 --> 01:09:26.017
Archie?

01:09:26.017 --> 01:09:28.017
Archie, is that you?

01:09:34.956 --> 01:09:36.805
- I just wanna say I'm sorry, Sandra.

01:09:38.420 --> 01:09:39.970
I should had done right by you.

01:09:43.107 --> 01:09:45.256
- Archie.

01:09:45.256 --> 01:09:46.747
- Yeah.

01:09:46.747 --> 01:09:50.160
- You never told me
what you went to jail for.

01:09:50.160 --> 01:09:51.620
- Yeah, I did.

01:09:51.620 --> 01:09:53.326
- No, you didn't.

01:09:53.326 --> 01:09:54.158
Tell me.

01:09:57.800 --> 01:09:58.650
- I killed a man.

01:10:00.500 --> 01:10:02.100
The truth is, I was just a dumb nigga,

01:10:02.100 --> 01:10:04.600
in the wrong place at the wrong time.

01:10:04.600 --> 01:10:06.657
But that's not important.

01:10:07.663 --> 01:10:09.463
- Tell me what's important.

01:10:11.370 --> 01:10:12.270
- Makin' it, baby.

01:10:13.200 --> 01:10:15.230
Seein' myself on the screen.

01:10:15.230 --> 01:10:16.430
I want people to see me.

01:10:17.683 --> 01:10:20.333
If I can't do that, then
I'm just another dumb nigga.

01:14:04.597 --> 01:14:07.097
- I knew they'd send somebody.

01:14:08.937 --> 01:14:10.387
What'd they offer you?

01:15:15.591 --> 01:15:17.924
I knew they'd send somebody.

01:15:20.693 --> 01:15:25.693
What'd they offer you?

01:17:10.456 --> 01:17:11.623
- Don't do it.

01:17:12.798 --> 01:17:13.798
Don't do it.

01:17:56.493 --> 01:17:58.493
I can't believe it.

01:17:58.493 --> 01:18:00.480
I didn't think I would ever find you folk.

01:18:00.480 --> 01:18:02.180
You'll be back at your
penthouse in no time,

01:18:02.180 --> 01:18:04.420
with all your Hollywood friends.

01:18:04.420 --> 01:18:06.220
Nobody will ever know this happened.

01:18:07.400 --> 01:18:10.660
You get to go home, I get
to be back in the movies.

01:18:10.660 --> 01:18:13.410
That's right, I'm an actor.

01:18:13.410 --> 01:18:16.020
Nothin' like you, but who knows?

01:18:16.020 --> 01:18:18.000
Maybe someday, someday...

01:18:21.920 --> 01:18:23.210
Hey.

01:18:23.210 --> 01:18:25.640
If I were you, I would be celebrating.

01:18:25.640 --> 01:18:27.750
- Celebrating what?

01:18:27.750 --> 01:18:29.550
You killed him.

01:18:29.550 --> 01:18:31.270
You killed Tweet.

01:18:31.270 --> 01:18:34.233
- Wingate said you were kidnapped,
he showed me the letter.

01:18:35.112 --> 01:18:36.923
- He showed you a letter?

01:18:37.910 --> 01:18:39.963
You like to pretend to be other people?

01:18:41.430 --> 01:18:42.263
Me too.

01:18:45.030 --> 01:18:48.033
Growing up in Kansas, we
were just poor white trash.

01:18:49.413 --> 01:18:51.293
I would dream about getting away.

01:18:52.230 --> 01:18:53.880
Guess that's how I wound up here.

01:18:55.860 --> 01:18:58.873
But this town, it ain't right.

01:18:59.720 --> 01:19:03.293
They wanted to use me and cut
me up into a million pieces.

01:19:04.600 --> 01:19:07.863
But Tweet, he was somehow different.

01:19:09.250 --> 01:19:10.930
He was the first Negro...

01:19:12.520 --> 01:19:15.323
The first man to treat me good.

01:19:31.380 --> 01:19:33.680
- You and Tweet were
together this whole time?

01:19:34.880 --> 01:19:38.230
- We tried to keep it a secret,
but I knew it wouldn't be

01:19:38.230 --> 01:19:41.513
long before the studio found
out, so we decided to run away.

01:19:43.190 --> 01:19:46.080
- You were gonna run away
from being a movie star?

01:19:46.080 --> 01:19:47.190
- Crazy?

01:19:48.653 --> 01:19:50.123
All your hopes and dreams.

01:19:51.170 --> 01:19:52.710
I guess your dreams don't mean much,

01:19:52.710 --> 01:19:54.593
if you got nobody to share them with.

01:19:57.550 --> 01:19:59.650
We were gonna take the
money and go someplace

01:19:59.650 --> 01:20:01.483
where it didn't matter who you were.

01:20:04.300 --> 01:20:06.783
It was Tweet's idea to
fake the kidnapping.

01:20:08.070 --> 01:20:11.143
Make it look real so that
Wingate would pay the ransom.

01:20:12.870 --> 01:20:14.127
Instead, he sent you.

01:21:03.738 --> 01:21:04.988
- That's right.

01:21:05.830 --> 01:21:07.163
I used you to get to her.

01:21:08.588 --> 01:21:10.740
And I would do it again if I had to.

01:21:10.740 --> 01:21:14.113
You see, when you sign a contract
with a studio, we own you.

01:21:16.247 --> 01:21:18.363
The studio decides what
color your hair is.

01:21:19.898 --> 01:21:21.898
The studio decides what movies you make.

01:21:23.870 --> 01:21:26.520
And the studio decides who
you're seen with in pubic.

01:21:28.700 --> 01:21:31.223
All to sell the people
an all-American image.

01:21:34.070 --> 01:21:36.557
And America is not ready for a movie star

01:21:36.557 --> 01:21:38.790
who is married to a nigger.

01:21:38.790 --> 01:21:41.693
- You lied to me and told me
she was in some kinda trouble.

01:21:43.600 --> 01:21:47.470
- She was in trouble, and I saved her.

01:21:47.470 --> 01:21:48.583
You saved her.

01:21:50.350 --> 01:21:54.350
From a life of despair and disgrace.

01:21:54.350 --> 01:21:55.800
- I don't like being lied to.

01:21:57.700 --> 01:21:58.533
- What difference does it make

01:21:58.533 --> 01:22:00.230
whether you knew the truth or not?

01:22:01.240 --> 01:22:02.623
You came to me, remember?

01:22:03.720 --> 01:22:05.233
You wanted to be a star.

01:22:06.180 --> 01:22:07.080
Well, now you can.

01:22:09.070 --> 01:22:10.603
And don't worry, Mr. Glass.

01:22:11.860 --> 01:22:13.610
I intend to keep my promise to you.

01:22:15.810 --> 01:22:17.510
For your remarkable service to me,

01:22:21.060 --> 01:22:23.103
you've earned a part in one of my films.

01:22:26.730 --> 01:22:27.733
And as for Mona,

01:22:30.130 --> 01:22:32.920
who allowed herself to be
dragged through the mud,

01:22:32.920 --> 01:22:34.023
I'll clean her up.

01:22:35.550 --> 01:22:37.700
And just in case you're,

01:22:37.700 --> 01:22:40.683
gettin' any ideas of changing
the terms of our agreement,

01:22:41.680 --> 01:22:42.513
forget it.

01:22:43.690 --> 01:22:45.690
If I'm willin' to do this to her,

01:22:45.690 --> 01:22:48.677
just think what I'd be
willin' to do to you.

01:22:53.911 --> 01:22:54.744
- No.

01:22:55.783 --> 01:22:57.842
Get your hands off of me.

01:23:19.886 --> 01:23:24.886
Get away from him!

01:23:24.945 --> 01:23:25.778
Get away.

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:31.960
- I knew when
I punched Jack Wingate,

01:23:31.960 --> 01:23:34.460
I would never work as an
actor in this town again.

01:23:35.720 --> 01:23:38.560
It didn't matter, there
are plenty of others left

01:23:38.560 --> 01:23:40.143
to play Sambos in the movies.

01:23:41.210 --> 01:23:42.450
Not me.

01:23:42.450 --> 01:23:44.600
- There is no place in this town

01:23:44.600 --> 01:23:46.250
that I won't be able to find you.

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:49.890
I own you.

01:23:49.890 --> 01:23:51.573
I created Mona Lane.

01:23:52.540 --> 01:23:54.210
You were nothing but a
freckle-faced farm girl

01:23:54.210 --> 01:23:55.473
when you came to me.

01:23:56.850 --> 01:24:00.927
You go ahead and run, but
I'll be right behind you.

01:24:22.655 --> 01:24:24.520
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

01:24:24.520 --> 01:24:26.720
It ain't the first time
I got my ass kicked.

01:24:38.460 --> 01:24:39.860
You really loved Tweet?

01:24:41.836 --> 01:24:43.286
- I mean, you heard him play.

01:24:44.400 --> 01:24:45.500
Of course I loved him.

01:24:49.890 --> 01:24:51.290
Where are you gonna take me?

01:24:54.880 --> 01:24:56.083
- Outta this damn town.

01:25:24.623 --> 01:25:26.290
Thank you very much.

01:25:29.050 --> 01:25:31.700
The next train to Kansas
City leaves in half an hour.

01:25:34.460 --> 01:25:35.410
- What will you do?

01:25:38.240 --> 01:25:39.290
- Stay here, I guess.

01:25:40.210 --> 01:25:41.560
I got no other place to go.

01:25:49.290 --> 01:25:50.740
- My real name's Mary Hayden.

01:25:58.070 --> 01:25:59.671
- Come on.

01:26:15.030 --> 01:26:15.863
- Are you Mona?

01:26:15.863 --> 01:26:17.200
Can I have your autograph?

01:26:17.200 --> 01:26:19.933
I saw your last picture,
it was a real ride.

01:26:20.798 --> 01:26:23.130
Thank you so much!

01:26:23.130 --> 01:26:23.963
- Hey, Mona, where you been?

01:26:23.963 --> 01:26:25.580
Everybody's been lookin' for ya.

01:26:25.580 --> 01:26:27.780
Hey, come on, Mona,
what's the big deal?

01:26:28.678 --> 01:26:30.198
- A nigger?

01:26:30.198 --> 01:26:31.760
You've been sleeping with a nigger, Mona?

01:26:31.760 --> 01:26:33.260
- Just let me get one more.

01:26:33.260 --> 01:26:34.093
- Jimmy!

01:26:34.980 --> 01:26:35.919
Jimmy, calm down.

01:26:35.919 --> 01:26:36.752
- You want me to calm down,

01:26:36.752 --> 01:26:37.787
when you've been sleeping with a nigger?

01:26:37.787 --> 01:26:40.342
Go and play her.

01:27:16.911 --> 01:27:20.117
- I just stayed there, watching
her bleed on the ground.

01:27:21.060 --> 01:27:22.623
There was nothing I could do.

01:27:30.303 --> 01:27:34.220
Just thought that somebody
should tell the truth,

01:27:34.220 --> 01:27:35.893
about what really happened.

01:30:45.230 --> 01:30:46.063
- Dad.

01:30:47.309 --> 01:30:49.170
Dad.

01:30:49.170 --> 01:30:50.003
I love you.

01:30:50.970 --> 01:30:53.523
But you think of yourself as a black man,

01:30:55.170 --> 01:30:58.463
and I, I think of myself as a man.
