00:03.700 --> 00:08.290
<b>Why?!</b>

00:27.540 --> 00:29.440
<b><i>You have it easy, Killua.</i></b>

00:31.040 --> 00:32.770
<b><i>You're perfectly calm.</i></b>

00:36.000 --> 00:38.020
<b><i>Since it means nothing to you...</i></b>

00:47.790 --> 00:51.760
<b>Gon's cry had guided 
Meleoron to the two boys.</b>

02:12.980 --> 02:18.030
<b>Insult x And x Payback</b>

02:24.360 --> 02:26.830
<b>I'm going to have to refuse.</b>

02:27.530 --> 02:29.460
<b>Right now, I'm not in the mood.</b>

02:29.850 --> 02:31.830
<b>Come on, don't say that.</b>

02:32.540 --> 02:35.460
<b>Just think of it as bad luck that I found you!</b>

02:35.940 --> 02:39.840
<b>Let me test my new technique on you.</b>

02:46.270 --> 02:47.910
<b>That hurts, man...</b>

02:47.910 --> 02:50.220
<b>You don't have to give me such a dirty look.</b>

02:50.220 --> 02:53.980
<b>The one I really want to fight 
is someone else, you know.</b>

02:54.650 --> 02:56.910
<b>That guy with sunglasses, 
carrying the big pipe.</b>

02:56.910 --> 02:59.360
<b>Aren't you with him?</b>

03:00.380 --> 03:04.710
<b>Then, why don't you go and find him?</b>

03:05.520 --> 03:07.310
<b>I know where he is.</b>

03:07.310 --> 03:08.780
<b>But I can't get to him.</b>

03:08.780 --> 03:12.250
<b>He controls smoke, and he's hidden 
himself behind a smokescreen.</b>

03:12.720 --> 03:15.750
<b>And I can't get through.</b>

03:16.360 --> 03:20.010
<b>I climbed up to the roof, to see 
if I could get in from above...</b>

03:22.290 --> 03:24.740
<b>And I happened to spot you.</b>

03:27.280 --> 03:32.770
<b>So I'm supposed to be the warm-up 
before your main fight?</b>

03:33.420 --> 03:35.270
<b>Bingo!</b>

03:39.880 --> 03:41.910
<b>I've had it for today...</b>

03:45.390 --> 03:47.790
<b>Will you listen to what I have to say?</b>

03:48.190 --> 03:51.950
<b>For the first time since taking 
over the family business,</b>

03:51.950 --> 03:55.720
<b>I may have killed someone who wasn't my target.</b>

03:55.720 --> 03:58.630
<b>Dude, my technique is awesome!</b>

03:58.630 --> 04:01.920
<b>Don't be too shocked when you see it.</b>

04:01.920 --> 04:05.550
<b>Well, you'll still be shocked in the end...</b>

04:07.320 --> 04:10.040
<b>You're a self-centered fellow.</b>

04:10.960 --> 04:14.690
<b>Doesn't look like I'll be able to 
persuade you to let me go.</b>

04:15.200 --> 04:17.190
<b>Bingo and bingo!</b>

04:20.350 --> 04:23.960
<b>You should watch your back.</b>

04:26.740 --> 04:28.000
<b>What an old trick!</b>

04:28.000 --> 04:29.940
<b>I won't fall for that!</b>

04:29.940 --> 04:33.960
<b>Your buddy told me to keep 
my eyes on my opponeâ€”</b>

04:41.900 --> 04:46.470
<b>Well, the result would have 
been the same either way.</b>

05:00.800 --> 05:03.030
<b>Should I have spared him?</b>

05:04.410 --> 05:05.880
<b>Not necessary.</b>

05:11.390 --> 05:12.750
<b>How's Killua doing?</b>

05:13.170 --> 05:16.020
<b>Hmm? He's matured.</b>

05:16.990 --> 05:20.710
<b>And I believe that he's removed Illumi's needle.</b>

05:21.900 --> 05:23.050
<b>I see.</b>

05:23.930 --> 05:26.140
<b>Oh, that's right...</b>

05:26.140 --> 05:28.920
<b>I had a rare experience today.</b>

05:28.920 --> 05:32.030
<b>My time was compressed!</b>

05:32.600 --> 05:35.870
<b>I must remember to ignore 
half of everything you say.</b>

05:44.550 --> 05:47.390
<b>Okay, we should be safe here.</b>

05:47.390 --> 05:48.740
<b>Explain what's going on.</b>

05:51.110 --> 05:53.240
<b><i>God's Accomplice... Undo!</i></b>

05:53.970 --> 05:58.500
<b>Shoot's out of the battle, 
and Knuckle is fighting Youpi alone.</b>

05:58.870 --> 06:00.380
<b>I need your help...</b>

06:00.660 --> 06:05.120
<b>Knuckle's going to keep running, 
to try and buy time.</b>

06:05.120 --> 06:06.630
<b>He's crazy!</b>

06:06.960 --> 06:11.390
<b>Okay, what's the minimum length of time 
you can maintain God's Accomplice?</b>

06:11.580 --> 06:16.120
<b>The first time, I was so nervous, I failed 
and had to tap out after ten seconds.</b>

06:16.120 --> 06:18.010
<b>But I've regained my cool.</b>

06:18.010 --> 06:20.990
<b>If I don't move, I can hold my 
breath for at least a minute!</b>

06:20.990 --> 06:21.980
<b>That's plenty of time.</b>

06:22.600 --> 06:25.070
<b>I just need one chance.</b>

06:28.510 --> 06:33.070
<b>Approximately three minutes 
before Killua raised his finger...</b>

06:37.250 --> 06:39.320
<b>Knuckle was airborne.</b>

06:42.780 --> 06:47.550
<b>In Knuckle's own opinion, his strongest 
point was his ability to run away.</b>

06:58.850 --> 07:00.680
<b>Once, to help his friends escape,</b>

07:00.680 --> 07:02.590
<b>he knocked out a cop,</b>

07:02.590 --> 07:09.170
<b>and eluded four patrol cars and dozens 
of police for a full day and night, on foot.</b>

07:09.560 --> 07:12.050
<b>The day he finally escaped was the day</b>

07:13.020 --> 07:15.250
<b>he graduated from grade school.</b>

07:23.740 --> 07:27.710
<b>His stamina when maintaining top speed</b>

07:27.710 --> 07:30.510
<b>far exceeds that of a cheetah.</b>

07:31.940 --> 07:34.760
<b>To save Shoot, Knuckle had chosen</b>

07:34.760 --> 07:39.580
<b>to reveal himself and use an out-boxing 
strategy against Youpi.</b>

07:39.580 --> 07:41.220
<b>For the most part, it was the right choice.</b>

07:46.370 --> 07:47.650
<b><i>He stopped chasing me?</i></b>

07:49.150 --> 07:53.280
<b>If there was one thing he miscalculated, 
it was his opponent's intentions.</b>

07:54.720 --> 07:57.030
<b><i>Shoot's in trouble! Crap!</i></b>

08:00.240 --> 08:05.340
<b>Shoot and Knuckle considered 
Youpi a high-priority target.</b>

08:06.020 --> 08:09.300
<b>But Youpi wasn't as focused on them.</b>

08:10.150 --> 08:13.570
<b>As a Royal Guard, protecting the 
King was his mission.</b>

08:13.570 --> 08:17.810
<b>His focus was on keeping enemies from the King.</b>

08:19.230 --> 08:23.930
<b>Youpi still believed the King 
to be in the throne room.</b>

08:23.930 --> 08:27.520
<b>And since guarding the stairway 
was his assignment,</b>

08:27.930 --> 08:34.100
<b>he was convinced that Pitou and 
Pouf were protecting the King.</b>

08:34.660 --> 08:41.240
<b>So his main priority was to keep enemies 
away from the throne room.</b>

08:41.240 --> 08:44.020
<b>Since he didn't know how 
many enemies there were,</b>

08:44.410 --> 08:48.110
<b>the nature of his opponent's 
ability took second priority.</b>

08:48.830 --> 08:51.630
<b>As did any enemies running or dying.</b>

08:51.960 --> 08:54.680
<b>They did not warrant his concern.</b>

08:55.420 --> 08:57.680
<b>Hey! Pitou!</b>

09:12.950 --> 09:14.300
<b>Shoot!</b>

09:15.310 --> 09:17.200
<b>Shoot was still alive.</b>

09:21.480 --> 09:22.800
<b>Shoot...</b>

09:28.890 --> 09:33.460
<b>Given their positions, when Youpi turned back,</b>

09:33.780 --> 09:35.190
<b>he must have spotted Shoot.</b>

09:43.040 --> 09:45.580
<b>Then we aren't even worth...</b>

09:46.620 --> 09:48.660
<b>finishing off?</b>

09:50.280 --> 09:54.790
<b>Youpi didn't care if Shoot lived or died.</b>

09:55.420 --> 09:59.490
<b>After having fought him with all they had,</b>

09:59.490 --> 10:01.990
<b>the pair had never felt so humiliated.</b>

10:04.530 --> 10:06.390
<b><i>Are Shoot</i></b>

10:07.490 --> 10:09.110
<b><i>and I</i></b>

10:09.880 --> 10:12.460
<b><i>no more than flies?!</i></b>

10:13.020 --> 10:14.760
<b><i>Fine, then!</i></b>

10:14.760 --> 10:17.490
<b><i>You're gonna regret this!</i></b>

10:17.490 --> 10:23.510
<b><i>In a few more minutes, 
this fly will send you flying!</i></b>

10:25.570 --> 10:28.020
<b>Pitou! Pouf!</b>

10:28.880 --> 10:31.080
<b>Are you there?</b>

10:32.950 --> 10:36.050
<b><i>The boss used Smoky Jail on the throne room.</i></b>

10:36.700 --> 10:39.280
<b><i>That means he and Pouf are alone inside.</i></b>

10:40.070 --> 10:42.410
<b><i>The King isn't in the throne room!</i></b>

10:43.770 --> 10:47.290
<b>Say something! Can't you hear me?</b>

10:47.290 --> 10:48.290
<b>Hey!</b>

10:50.510 --> 10:52.150
<b><i>You fool...</i></b>

10:52.150 --> 10:54.720
<b><i>You're free to defend an empty throne room!</i></b>

10:56.350 --> 11:01.380
<b><i>I'll take Shoot, and watch from a safe distance.</i></b>

11:05.380 --> 11:07.950
<b>Damn it...</b>

11:14.370 --> 11:17.330
<b>By the time Knuckle realized his mistake,</b>

11:17.330 --> 11:20.560
<b>he had already made another.</b>

11:23.580 --> 11:26.280
<b><i>Shoot and Youpi must have seen one another.</i></b>

11:27.690 --> 11:31.530
<b><i>Shoot must have been prepared 
to die at that moment.</i></b>

11:33.980 --> 11:36.910
<b><i>That's the kind of fight we came for.</i></b>

11:38.220 --> 11:42.530
<b><i>But he ignored Shoot...</i></b>

11:44.980 --> 11:48.350
<b>When Knuckle pictured the 
expression on Youpi's face</b>

11:48.350 --> 11:52.290
<b>after he'd glanced at the bloody Shoot 
and headed up to the third floor,</b>

11:52.980 --> 11:57.280
<b>Knuckle realized his new mistake.</b>

11:59.420 --> 12:00.780
<b>Damn it.</b>

12:02.250 --> 12:04.130
<b>Damn it...</b>

12:04.690 --> 12:08.990
<b><i>Am I supposed to ignore the fact 
that my buddy's been humiliated?</i></b>

12:09.580 --> 12:10.970
<b><i>For what reason?</i></b>

12:14.090 --> 12:15.630
<b><i>For the world?</i></b>

12:16.440 --> 12:17.830
<b><i>For humanity?</i></b>

12:19.380 --> 12:24.380
<b><i>And if our mission succeeds, 
I just shake Shoot's hand and say,</i></b>

12:25.080 --> 12:26.540
<b><i>"We did it"?</i></b>

12:27.700 --> 12:30.650
<b><i>Pat each other's shoulders and laugh?</i></b>

12:31.120 --> 12:34.140
<b><i>Even though he was humiliated?</i></b>

12:34.700 --> 12:36.850
<b><i>I can't do that!</i></b>

12:39.000 --> 12:40.710
<b>That isn't right...</b>

12:47.480 --> 12:52.410
<b>C-Come on...</b>

12:53.500 --> 12:54.670
<b>Oh, sorry.</b>

12:55.170 --> 13:00.170
<b>And while I'm apologizing, I need 
you to wait here a little longer!</b>

13:00.900 --> 13:06.140
<b>I need to punch that guy in the face...</b>

13:07.540 --> 13:13.530
<b>And I'll throw another punch for you!</b>

13:18.030 --> 13:23.380
<b><i>It's my job to stay calm and stop Knuckle...</i></b>

13:24.960 --> 13:26.480
<b><i>"Have you lost your mind?</i></b>

13:27.000 --> 13:28.190
<b><i>Don't go.</i></b>

13:28.750 --> 13:31.920
<b><i>Just keep your mouth shut, and buy more time."</i></b>

13:32.650 --> 13:35.310
<b><i>That is my...</i></b>

13:39.520 --> 13:41.440
<b>Do it, Knuckle!</b>

13:42.860 --> 13:44.710
<b>Damn it!</b>

13:45.050 --> 13:46.270
<b>That bastard...</b>

13:46.850 --> 13:47.960
<b>He...</b>

13:48.930 --> 13:49.970
<b>He...</b>

13:50.780 --> 13:53.290
<b>looked at me like I was trash!</b>

13:54.470 --> 13:58.280
<b>Give that bastard an extra punch for me...</b>

14:02.510 --> 14:04.740
<b>Yeah, I got it!</b>

14:06.790 --> 14:09.310
<b><i>Sorry, master...</i></b>

14:10.340 --> 14:12.240
<b><i>We're both fools.</i></b>

14:14.590 --> 14:17.670
<b><i>There's something more important 
than the world right now!</i></b>

14:19.990 --> 14:21.580
<b>Knuckle's new mistake</b>

14:22.710 --> 14:25.070
<b>was a misjudgment of his priorities.</b>

14:40.090 --> 14:43.160
<b><i>My attacks aren't having any 
effect on this smoke...</i></b>

14:44.400 --> 14:45.980
<b>Your Majesty!</b>

14:46.850 --> 14:49.250
<b>Pitou! Pouf!</b>

14:49.840 --> 14:52.280
<b>Are you there? Hey!</b>

14:53.740 --> 14:55.380
<b><i>Is that Youpi?</i></b>

14:56.610 --> 14:58.760
<b><i>Were they both defeated?</i></b>

15:00.390 --> 15:02.650
<b><i>I hope the old man's doing okay...</i></b>

15:05.090 --> 15:08.260
<b><i>Why isn't Pouf responding?</i></b>

15:09.850 --> 15:10.920
<b><i>Something's wrong.</i></b>

15:11.510 --> 15:15.690
<b><i>Why is he staying inside his cocoon?</i></b>

15:16.480 --> 15:21.350
<b><i>I would have expected him to be in 
more of a hurry to get to the King.</i></b>

15:22.720 --> 15:26.000
<b><i>Could we have made...</i></b>

15:26.970 --> 15:29.420
<b><i>some kind of mistake about the Royal Guard?</i></b>

15:30.620 --> 15:35.250
<b><i>Is our operation actually working?</i></b>

15:37.960 --> 15:38.830
<b><i>Don't think about it!</i></b>

15:39.600 --> 15:41.960
<b><i>I'm here to fulfill my mission!</i></b>

15:44.900 --> 15:48.730
<b><i>Doubt, worry, impatience...</i></b>

15:50.450 --> 15:55.030
<b><i>Negative emotions are growing, 
but his resolve has not faltered.</i></b>

15:56.240 --> 15:58.650
<b><i>Just as I would expect from a strong fighter.</i></b>

15:59.260 --> 16:00.750
<b><i>I'm impressed.</i></b>

16:02.230 --> 16:07.360
<b><i>However, that will be the constraint 
that weakens your decision-making.</i></b>

16:10.320 --> 16:11.360
<b><i>Damn...</i></b>

16:12.440 --> 16:15.240
<b><i>Why is Pitou's</i> En <i>gone?</i></b>

16:16.200 --> 16:20.600
<b><i>Have the King, Pitou, and Pouf all vanished?</i></b>

16:20.600 --> 16:22.280
<b><i>Leaving me behind?</i></b>

16:23.870 --> 16:25.630
<b><i>What happened?</i></b>

16:26.230 --> 16:28.000
<b><i>What's going on?</i></b>

16:28.380 --> 16:29.450
<b>It's time.</b>

16:29.920 --> 16:31.390
<b>Adding interest.</b>

16:32.420 --> 16:33.380
<b>Shut up!</b>

16:35.860 --> 16:38.390
<b><i>The black fog on my shoulder won't go away.</i></b>

16:38.910 --> 16:41.640
<b><i>And the number on this thing keeps increasing.</i></b>

16:42.040 --> 16:44.090
<b><i>I have to find the King!</i></b>

16:45.040 --> 16:48.150
<b><i>Damn, I should have killed the fly downstairs.</i></b>

16:48.450 --> 16:51.010
<b><i>That might have gotten rid of this fog.</i></b>

16:52.180 --> 16:55.160
<b><i>But I have to find the King!</i></b>

16:55.830 --> 16:57.410
<b><i>What's going on?!</i></b>

16:57.800 --> 16:59.410
<b><i>I'm getting annoyed!</i></b>

17:09.230 --> 17:10.440
<b>Yo.</b>

17:21.390 --> 17:27.440
<b>What the hell is wrong with all of you?!</b>

17:32.310 --> 17:35.450
<b>And with that shout, Youpi transformed.</b>

17:37.110 --> 17:40.840
<b>It was drastic enough to make Knuckle, 
who thought he had come prepared,</b>

17:40.840 --> 17:44.960
<b>instantly switch from an offensive 
stance to an evasive one.</b>

17:45.790 --> 17:49.730
<b>This manifestation of evil</b>

17:50.590 --> 17:53.800
<b>clearly meant only to destroy.</b>

18:30.430 --> 18:31.670
<b>Hang on!</b>

18:32.470 --> 18:33.650
<b>Did you...</b>

18:34.120 --> 18:35.420
<b>hit him?</b>

18:35.700 --> 18:36.700
<b>Eh?</b>

18:37.430 --> 18:39.840
<b>Did you hit him...</b>

18:40.440 --> 18:41.550
<b>for me?</b>

18:41.810 --> 18:43.610
<b>Not yet, damn it!</b>

18:44.090 --> 18:46.280
<b>I'll hit him hard, so hold on!</b>

18:46.740 --> 18:50.270
<b>But we have to run, so we don't die first!</b>

19:07.370 --> 19:10.170
<b>For the first time in his life,</b>

19:10.170 --> 19:13.130
<b>Youpi had endured an excessive amount of stress.</b>

19:13.500 --> 19:16.640
<b>This had made it apparent that</b>

19:16.640 --> 19:20.210
<b>his power was not meant for guarding the King.</b>

19:21.400 --> 19:23.720
<b>Rather, he realized that his violent rage</b>

19:24.100 --> 19:29.500
<b>could fuel a rapid increase in the 
mass of both his body and his aura.</b>

19:31.340 --> 19:34.700
<b>The destruction brought him great pleasure,</b>

19:34.700 --> 19:41.040
<b>after which his body rapidly shrank, 
and he felt a strong sense of loss.</b>

19:44.090 --> 19:49.870
<b>Knuckle's superior experience helped him 
understand what had happened to Youpi.</b>

19:51.100 --> 19:52.370
<b>We can win.</b>

19:53.720 --> 19:55.600
<b><i>That was a powerful blast.</i></b>

19:57.070 --> 20:01.560
<b><i>I doubt it'll be easy to goad him 
into doing that on purpose,</i></b>

20:01.560 --> 20:03.980
<b><i>and make it out unharmed.</i></b>

20:04.800 --> 20:09.040
<b><i>But the return for taking that risk</i></b>

20:09.040 --> 20:11.110
<b><i>will be enormous.</i></b>

20:13.360 --> 20:15.400
<b><i>I make him mad, so he blows up.</i></b>

20:16.630 --> 20:19.210
<b><i>The perfect time to hit him</i></b>

20:19.210 --> 20:22.270
<b><i>would be when he's charging up.</i></b>

20:22.270 --> 20:24.910
<b><i>And the aura required to fuel his explosion</i></b>

20:25.480 --> 20:28.550
<b><i>will cause him to go bankrupt sooner.</i></b>

20:30.720 --> 20:34.230
<b>The plan Knuckle formed on the spot</b>

20:34.230 --> 20:39.170
<b>was almost flawless for dealing 
with the berserk Youpi.</b>

20:39.720 --> 20:44.300
<b>However, Youpi's true worth only 
became clear after the explosion.</b>

20:45.730 --> 20:49.100
<b>As Youpi transitioned between 
lingering pleasure and despondency,</b>

20:49.700 --> 20:53.480
<b>this selfish ability that could be 
called the dregs of his ego</b>

20:53.900 --> 20:57.480
<b>was focused solely on how he could use</b>

20:58.170 --> 21:01.180
<b>this power for the King's sake.</b>

21:03.040 --> 21:04.440
<b><i>Selflessness...</i></b>

21:05.780 --> 21:09.230
<b>His Ant instincts and Magical Beast mentality</b>

21:09.230 --> 21:14.540
<b>continued to function calmly even after 
the discovery of his burst of emotion.</b>

21:16.190 --> 21:19.050
<b><i>My contribution to the King will be</i></b>

21:19.050 --> 21:25.010
<b><i>how well I can control this ability 
without letting my emotions take over.</i></b>

21:26.160 --> 21:27.510
<b><i>In other words,</i></b>

21:28.620 --> 21:32.260
<b><i>I must use it to destroy the intruders.</i></b>

21:34.260 --> 21:38.510
<b>Now that Youpi had learned how 
to be both enraged and composed,</b>

21:39.060 --> 21:42.590
<b>the risk for Knuckle was overly great.</b>

21:45.010 --> 21:48.300
<b>Approximately three minutes have 
passed since the mission began.</b>

21:57.090 --> 22:00.610
<b>The intentions of all involved
are beginning to come together.</b>

23:24.940 --> 23:27.210
<b>Next time: A x False x Rage.</b>

23:27.210 --> 23:29.060
<b>Yeah, screw you!</b>

23:29.060 --> 23:30.320
<b>Sorry, Killua...</b>

23:30.320 --> 23:31.780
<b>I won't forgive you.</b>

23:31.780 --> 23:33.310
<b>Here's a chocolate robot.</b>

23:33.310 --> 23:34.260
<b>Gon!</b>
