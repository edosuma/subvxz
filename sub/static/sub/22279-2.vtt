00:11.233 --> 00:13.767
NARRATOR: On this episode
of Life Below Zero,

00:13.800 --> 00:18.700
Alaskans battle to survive
as life returns to the land.

00:18.733 --> 00:21.667
The Hailstones struggle
with a lesson in survival.

00:21.700 --> 00:22.800
TING: Right above us, Idi.

00:23.367 --> 00:24.733
(GRUNTS)

00:24.767 --> 00:27.633
NARRATOR: Changes
in the tundra could sink
Sue's quest for food.

00:27.667 --> 00:29.267
I'm afraid of breaking
the ankle.

00:30.533 --> 00:34.567
NARRATOR: Waking predators
have Erik Salitan on the move.

00:34.600 --> 00:37.833
And in Eagle,
Kate pushes her body
to the breaking point.

00:38.467 --> 00:40.133
Son of a bitch. (GROANS)

00:59.133 --> 01:02.533
SUE: When you live out here
like I do at Kavik all alone,

01:02.567 --> 01:06.200
I can't help
but notice patterns.

01:06.233 --> 01:11.967
The pattern for the caribou,
which is my main food source
when I'm here by myself,

01:12.000 --> 01:15.000
they come up in spring,
they leave in the fall.

01:15.033 --> 01:16.733
This year they're almost
a month late.

01:17.433 --> 01:18.567
Where are they?

01:18.600 --> 01:20.300
NARRATOR:
Isolated in the tundra,

01:20.333 --> 01:24.200
Sue Aikens relies
on caribou meat
for her survival,

01:24.233 --> 01:26.600
but with an unusually
late migration,

01:26.633 --> 01:29.500
Sue is forced to venture out
in search of alternatives.

01:29.533 --> 01:30.667
SUE: I am an opportunist.

01:30.700 --> 01:32.467
We all are when we live out
in the bush.

01:32.500 --> 01:35.500
Whatever you need to do
to survive, that's what
your butt's gonna be doing.

01:35.533 --> 01:38.100
But my butt's not
finding them in here.
Time to go outside.

01:43.667 --> 01:44.833
Just looking.

01:45.800 --> 01:49.033
Walking the runway.

01:49.067 --> 01:53.100
Typically, along the sides
of the runway is a really
good place to find birds.

01:53.133 --> 01:56.700
The willow brush
will grow there,
and that's what they eat.

02:00.800 --> 02:02.367
There he is.

02:16.433 --> 02:21.100
Ptarmigan, they are
kind of low on the avian
intelligence scale.

02:21.133 --> 02:23.767
You know, they're not
the smartest birds
on the planet,

02:23.800 --> 02:27.133
but they sure seem to be smart
about getting away from me.

02:27.167 --> 02:28.967
I could've sworn I hit him.

02:29.000 --> 02:32.700
You don't ever leave
an injured animal anywhere.
I don't care what it is.

02:32.733 --> 02:35.667
You check, you double check,
you triple check,
check it again.

02:37.567 --> 02:39.067
Really?

02:40.733 --> 02:41.767
(GRUNTS)

02:42.467 --> 02:44.767
Ain't this some shit, huh?

02:44.800 --> 02:47.000
Springtime isn't
even fully here,

02:47.033 --> 02:48.833
and I'm already worried
about winter,

02:48.867 --> 02:52.867
so getting these
little hummers
while they're still, uh...

02:52.900 --> 02:55.567
While I'm still able
to hunt them, yeah,
I'll stock up on them.

02:55.600 --> 02:57.000
They're a tasty little snack.

02:57.033 --> 02:58.100
(GRUNTS)

03:00.667 --> 03:02.833
I'm afraid of
breaking the ankle.

03:02.867 --> 03:06.167
As long as it took me
to come through
that deep snow,

03:06.200 --> 03:10.033
he's probably sitting there
in Panama with a straw hat
by now.

03:10.067 --> 03:11.133
Oh, there he is.

03:21.900 --> 03:25.267
See? (LAUGHS)
I can't fucking get it.

03:26.933 --> 03:30.067
Yeah, he's apparently
in pretty good health.

03:30.100 --> 03:33.800
So, 400 million bullets later,

03:33.833 --> 03:36.500
he just chuckled at me
and went back the other way.

03:36.533 --> 03:39.067
So, I got to admit
when the better bird
comes along,

03:39.100 --> 03:40.900
and he's a better bird
than me.

03:40.933 --> 03:43.200
So, it would've been better
if I got something fresh
for the pot,

03:43.233 --> 03:46.400
but I'm just gonna
call it a night.

03:50.367 --> 03:52.533
ERIK: Some people view,
you know,
doing all these things

03:52.567 --> 03:55.233
associated with harvesting
wild animals as a lot of work,

03:55.267 --> 03:58.000
but the subsistence lifestyle
that I live is...

03:58.033 --> 03:59.500
It's the best life on earth.

03:59.533 --> 04:00.767
You get to choose
how you live.

04:00.800 --> 04:02.833
That's kind of the fun part
about life.

04:08.533 --> 04:09.767
MARTHA: Okay.

04:15.200 --> 04:16.433
High.

04:16.467 --> 04:17.667
Close though.

04:17.700 --> 04:20.433
My name is Erik Salitan,
and I'm a registered
guide outfitter.

04:20.467 --> 04:22.933
I've lived in Alaska
for about 12 years.

04:24.800 --> 04:26.033
MARTHA: Nice.

04:26.067 --> 04:28.333
I saw that one
hit in the ice, too.

04:28.367 --> 04:31.433
ERIK: A lot happening
in life this year.
I got married.

04:31.467 --> 04:34.400
I met my wife
while I was guiding
out here in Iliamna,

04:34.433 --> 04:36.467
and I just purchased
a fishing lodge.

04:36.500 --> 04:38.767
Iliamna is also my new wife's
hometown,

04:38.800 --> 04:40.733
so it kills two birds
with one stone.

04:40.767 --> 04:43.000
Get to spend some time
with her family down here,

04:43.033 --> 04:44.800
and also operate
my fishing lodge.

04:48.567 --> 04:50.800
I met Erik
about eight years ago

04:50.833 --> 04:53.567
when he came out here
working for an outfit.

04:53.600 --> 04:55.967
I actually found Erik
rather annoying.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.433
After eight years,
Erik got smarter
and he wised up,

04:58.467 --> 04:59.633
and now we're married.

04:59.667 --> 05:01.433
Looks good.

05:01.467 --> 05:03.300
-I pulled
the first one, but...
-Yeah.

05:03.333 --> 05:05.500
I was on on the second two,
and they're right
where they should be.

05:05.533 --> 05:07.200
Inch high at a hundred, so...

05:07.233 --> 05:12.633
Go put some gear together,
and maybe thinking about
going bear hunting.

05:12.667 --> 05:16.633
NARRATOR: Seasoned hunter
Erik Salitan provides
for himself and his wife

05:16.667 --> 05:18.933
by living off the land
across Alaska.

05:20.967 --> 05:26.100
ERIK: All the meat that
I eat in my household is meat
that I harvested myself.

05:26.133 --> 05:31.000
I don't purchase any beef,
or any chicken,
or any pork at the store.

05:31.033 --> 05:33.333
All the meat that I consume,

05:33.367 --> 05:37.367
and everybody who visits me,
consumes all caribou,
and sheep,

05:37.400 --> 05:39.967
and moose meat, and bear meat,

05:40.000 --> 05:44.267
and it's all home-grown,
organic, free ranging,
hormone free,

05:44.300 --> 05:46.933
top notch protein.

05:46.967 --> 05:49.933
NARRATOR: With one week
before the start
of his guiding season,

05:49.967 --> 05:53.767
Erik must turn his attention
to his next harvest.

05:53.800 --> 05:56.667
ERIK: Really exciting time
of year being out here
in the springtime,

05:56.700 --> 05:59.767
and I'm gonna head out
and do my first bear hunt
of the year here.

05:59.800 --> 06:01.800
I'm gonna go out,
head a little bit
to the Northwest,

06:01.833 --> 06:04.667
and do a hunt
for some grizzly bear.

06:04.700 --> 06:07.967
These interior grizzly bears
are a highly predatory animal.

06:08.000 --> 06:11.667
We're actually in a predator
control zone in Alaska.

06:11.700 --> 06:14.233
That means that the state
of Alaska is trying to reduce

06:14.267 --> 06:17.367
the numbers of brown bear,
grizzly bears,
and black bears.

06:17.400 --> 06:21.000
If you catch a bear that's
been eating berries and roots
and things like that,

06:21.033 --> 06:23.500
that can be a really
good eating animal.

06:24.133 --> 06:25.333
Am I gonna catch a bear?

06:25.367 --> 06:27.033
-Yeah, good luck!
-Thanks.

06:27.833 --> 06:29.967
-Love you, babe.
-Love you, too.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.833
ERIK: Hunting bears this early
in the spring is touch and go,
you know.

06:32.867 --> 06:35.967
It's very weather dependent,
but I need to do
what I need to do

06:36.000 --> 06:38.600
to harvest good food
for the table.

06:38.633 --> 06:40.467
It's all just being
self-motivated,

06:40.500 --> 06:42.733
and getting done
whatever needs to get done.

06:46.033 --> 06:47.700
ANDY: You gotta have
a passion for this life,

06:47.733 --> 06:50.333
and you gotta have
a certain way
of thinking about

06:50.367 --> 06:53.267
how you wanna live to be
successful out here.

06:53.300 --> 06:57.500
If you don't have that,
it's a good experience,
but it won't be your life.

07:11.500 --> 07:14.500
-These plants need
to go outside, Kate.
-Yup.

07:14.533 --> 07:17.133
You know what,
those pots are way too small.

07:17.167 --> 07:18.867
It's time now.

07:18.900 --> 07:20.633
Let's get these out of here.

07:20.667 --> 07:23.200
Eighty percent of the food
that we eat comes
from our garden.

07:23.233 --> 07:27.600
So, it's a really important
part of our livelihood here.

07:27.633 --> 07:30.400
The garden's I think ready
to plant this year,

07:30.433 --> 07:34.233
but we need to get a fence
built around that to keep
the dogs, rabbits,

07:34.267 --> 07:37.400
and other varmints
away from all the plants

07:37.433 --> 07:40.167
that we're gonna grow for
our food this coming winter.

07:44.033 --> 07:46.900
NARRATOR: 400 miles from
the nearest hardware store,

07:46.933 --> 07:49.967
Andy and Kate must gather
supplies to fence in
and protect

07:50.000 --> 07:51.800
an essential food source.

07:54.333 --> 07:58.000
KATE: It's quite
a sizable fence,
and around that garden.

07:58.033 --> 07:59.900
So, it's gonna be
a lot of work.

08:01.067 --> 08:03.667
-My back's sore.
-ANDY: Yeah.

08:03.700 --> 08:05.967
This is pretty redundant,
not much fun, work.

08:06.967 --> 08:10.133
Walking around
in this tangled up crap.

08:10.167 --> 08:13.700
Tripping and stumbling,
and I'm always worried about
a board with a nail in it.

08:13.733 --> 08:16.567
'Cause this is all stuff
left over from the flood.

08:16.600 --> 08:18.700
Living out here is nothing
but hard work.

08:18.733 --> 08:21.400
This life is a very busy life,

08:21.433 --> 08:23.467
and people don't realise
how busy it is.

08:23.500 --> 08:26.833
And it's constant planning,
and constant preparation.

08:26.867 --> 08:31.200
And it's always thinking
a month or two months
ahead of time

08:31.233 --> 08:33.133
of when you need
to do something.

08:33.167 --> 08:37.200
If you don't do that
preplanning,
the payoff isn't there.

08:45.667 --> 08:49.200
We're gonna cut a whole bunch
of poles that are gonna make
the uprights for this.

08:49.233 --> 08:50.967
Every one of those
needs to be sharpened,

08:51.000 --> 08:53.933
so there's quite a bit of
labour involved in doing this.

08:55.367 --> 08:57.433
(KATE GRUNTS)

08:57.467 --> 09:00.900
KATE: I've got a major issue
with my back for the past
few months,

09:00.933 --> 09:04.500
so I have to learn to stop
when it says stop.

09:05.767 --> 09:10.700
Or else I'm down
for a day or two,
and I can't afford that.

09:23.567 --> 09:26.400
Well, I just had to walk away.
It's just been a long day.

09:26.433 --> 09:29.400
And it's been
all bending and lifting.

09:29.433 --> 09:33.433
It's taken its toll
on my poor discs in my back.

09:33.467 --> 09:38.467
I feel I better stop,
otherwise I'll probably lose
a day tomorrow,

09:38.500 --> 09:39.833
and I don't wanna lose
a full day.

09:39.867 --> 09:42.733
I'd rather lose a couple of
hours at the end of the day,

09:42.767 --> 09:46.233
and rest it,
and then continue on tomorrow.

09:48.733 --> 09:49.933
(GROANS)

09:51.167 --> 09:52.567
CHIP: Well, you know,
we're hunters.

09:52.600 --> 09:55.300
So we take these opportunities
when they come.
You just don't know.

09:55.333 --> 09:58.833
It's not predictable,
but what we know is to be here
and when to be here,

09:58.867 --> 10:00.400
'cause these animals
will arrive.

10:10.100 --> 10:14.900
Well, I'm not much of a cook,
but I sure try. (LAUGHS)

10:14.933 --> 10:18.767
A lot of people don't realise
how many calories you burn
by being outside every day,

10:18.800 --> 10:20.500
and not in an office
or in a car.

10:20.533 --> 10:23.033
All of our transportation
is either a boat or on foot.

10:23.067 --> 10:25.400
So, we eat a lot.

10:25.433 --> 10:29.200
(LAUGHS) Which means
we need to hunt a lot.

10:29.233 --> 10:32.433
NARRATOR: Each spring,
the Hailstone family
travels 85 miles

10:32.467 --> 10:34.900
to set up camp in Kiwalik.

10:34.933 --> 10:36.933
They will remain
until the thaw's end.

10:36.967 --> 10:40.667
Stockpiling meat
and other resources for
the cruel winter ahead.

10:40.700 --> 10:42.933
CHIP: Our plan today
is to go downriver,

10:42.967 --> 10:45.033
and, um... It's a very
diverse place.

10:45.067 --> 10:46.600
You know, you got
the trees upriver.

10:46.633 --> 10:49.067
You got the ocean downriver.
We got the mountains
all around us.

10:49.100 --> 10:51.633
So, we have chances
of seeing almost anything
and everything.

10:51.667 --> 10:53.967
We have a possibility
of getting geese,
getting swans,

10:54.000 --> 10:55.467
getting any kind of birds.

10:55.500 --> 10:58.067
You never know
what you'll get,
but we need something fresh.

10:58.100 --> 11:01.667
We're hunters,
and it's time to hunt.

11:02.433 --> 11:04.733
Shh! Kids!
Get down.

11:04.767 --> 11:06.200
(CHIP SPEAKING)

11:06.233 --> 11:07.800
-AGNES: Swans?
-You watch the cooking.

11:07.833 --> 11:09.167
AGNES: Yeah.

11:10.267 --> 11:11.500
Oh, I see them.

11:14.267 --> 11:16.233
Oh, keep still!

11:16.267 --> 11:18.200
CHIP: Walk back, Carol.
Slowly.

11:20.933 --> 11:23.267
(MIMICS SWAN CALL)

11:25.833 --> 11:28.833
Okay. You got one right out
in the open over there.

11:28.867 --> 11:30.833
You see the one
just put his head down?

11:30.867 --> 11:33.633
-Yup, and the two more
just about to land.
-There you go.

11:33.667 --> 11:36.067
I'd call it 200/250 yards.

11:37.100 --> 11:38.700
(MIMICKING SWAN CALL)

11:45.667 --> 11:47.300
AGNES: Oh! Look, two more.

11:52.233 --> 11:53.567
CHIP: You were low.

11:55.200 --> 11:56.400
(CONTINUES SPEAKING)

12:02.600 --> 12:03.867
-Let's go finish breakfast.
-Okay.

12:03.900 --> 12:06.433
It's okay.
Thanks for taking the shot.

12:08.200 --> 12:09.667
Well, keep your eyes open, ah?

12:09.700 --> 12:13.300
Sure would like a swan
for lunch.

12:13.333 --> 12:15.067
-Goose for dinner.
-CHIP: We tried.

12:15.100 --> 12:16.767
We'll just keep on trying.

12:17.967 --> 12:19.900
SUE: I am a product
of my environment,

12:19.933 --> 12:22.733
but it... The environment
is not just the Arctic,

12:22.767 --> 12:25.967
it's everything I've been
through to this point.

12:26.000 --> 12:28.333
If you work well
with your environment,

12:28.367 --> 12:29.600
I think you're gonna
last longer.

12:35.733 --> 12:37.567
Another day goes by.

12:38.133 --> 12:40.467
Still no caribou.

12:40.500 --> 12:43.100
Trying to get the ptarmigans
on the runway.

12:44.100 --> 12:45.867
Yeah, wasn't too successful.

12:45.900 --> 12:48.267
Gotta change it up again.

12:48.300 --> 12:52.300
I'm gonna go take the Argo
and I'm going to switch
to the .410.

12:52.333 --> 12:54.500
It's a shotgun.
There is some wind.

12:54.533 --> 12:57.133
No doubt there is some wind
going on today,

12:57.167 --> 13:00.500
but I'm gonna just keep
plugging away at it.

13:00.533 --> 13:02.900
Hopefully feathers will fly.

13:02.933 --> 13:05.200
Let's get some ptarmigan.

13:05.233 --> 13:07.500
NARRATOR: With still no
caribou in Kavik,

13:07.533 --> 13:10.567
Sue is scrambling
for other sources of food.

13:10.600 --> 13:12.533
And with limited resources,

13:12.567 --> 13:15.500
she can't afford another
unsuccessful hunt.

13:15.533 --> 13:18.033
SUE: The caribou are about
a month overdue.

13:18.067 --> 13:21.767
It'd be like your local
grocery store hanging a sign
saying "on vacation."

13:21.800 --> 13:24.800
How do you get the bread,
milk, and eggs when they're
not coming back?

13:24.833 --> 13:28.300
When the caribou aren't in,
that's a whole big difference
in my diet.

13:28.333 --> 13:30.900
I have 290/300 days
I gotta cover.

13:30.933 --> 13:33.233
And now my main food group
isn't coming in.

13:45.267 --> 13:46.600
(SPEAKING)

13:51.900 --> 13:53.433
There's nowhere to hide.

13:53.467 --> 13:55.800
But I can't resist it.

13:55.833 --> 13:59.733
I'm gonna see if I can't
walk up the road maybe

13:59.767 --> 14:01.933
and get myself
a little ptarmigan.

14:37.000 --> 14:38.933
Man!

14:38.967 --> 14:41.833
I didn't get... Didn't even
come close to those guys.

14:42.600 --> 14:44.400
We're gonna keep focused.

14:50.533 --> 14:53.133
ANDY: I wouldn't
live out here if this
wasn't my dream.

14:53.167 --> 14:54.833
It's not for the faint
of heart.

14:54.867 --> 14:58.400
It's not something for someone
who's kind of half-ass at it.

14:58.433 --> 15:01.267
It's either full bore
or nothing at all out here.

15:11.433 --> 15:12.900
Last one.

15:14.600 --> 15:15.967
I'm glad you did that.

15:16.000 --> 15:17.867
I'd be there all day.

15:17.900 --> 15:19.767
NARRATOR: With a short
growing season,

15:19.800 --> 15:22.400
it's crucial for Andy and Kate
to protect the garden

15:22.433 --> 15:25.833
that will harvest much of
the food they'll need
throughout the year.

15:25.867 --> 15:28.433
But the work has
already taken its toll.

15:28.467 --> 15:31.900
I had to finish a little bit
earlier than I wanted to
yesterday.

15:31.933 --> 15:36.000
Um, I have a problem
with my back,
and it was really sore.

15:36.033 --> 15:38.633
But feeling good.

15:38.667 --> 15:42.567
I would recommend, even though
I've never done this,
I would recommend...

15:42.600 --> 15:45.333
Yeah, don't tell me how to
do it, 'cause that's something
I do know how to do,

15:45.367 --> 15:46.667
but I gotta start
from a corner.

15:46.700 --> 15:48.933
That's what I was gonna say.
Start from a corner.

15:48.967 --> 15:50.600
I know how to do this.

15:50.633 --> 15:52.333
I'm just telling you.
It's like...

15:52.367 --> 15:54.300
Yeah, I know, but I'm gonna
do it the way that
it's supposed to be done.

15:54.333 --> 15:55.733
And I'm gonna go
right around.

15:55.767 --> 15:58.533
You are not going to be
in control of this part.

15:58.567 --> 15:59.933
(LAUGHS) Good.

16:03.500 --> 16:05.900
NARRATOR: With the fence
project well underway,

16:05.933 --> 16:09.633
Andy turns his attention
to another critical task
for their harvest.

16:09.667 --> 16:15.000
Living out here we try
and utilise all the resources
that we have available to us.

16:15.033 --> 16:18.233
When we're clearing land,
whether it be for new
building projects,

16:18.267 --> 16:20.233
gardens, or firebreaks,

16:20.267 --> 16:22.967
I try and utilise those trees
as much as I can.

16:23.000 --> 16:26.667
The trees are chipped up,
and we turn that into compost.

16:27.633 --> 16:30.167
We don't have great soil
right around here.

16:30.200 --> 16:31.833
It's very acidic soil.

16:31.867 --> 16:34.467
So, composting is really
important to us.

16:35.800 --> 16:38.700
Everything that I do out here
has multipurpose.

16:38.733 --> 16:41.933
So, if I have any ability
to plan ahead,

16:41.967 --> 16:46.000
I'm able to get out a lot more
out of the limited resources
that I have here.

16:46.033 --> 16:50.500
There are very specific things
that you have to do during
certain times of the year.

16:50.533 --> 16:54.667
We have four and a half months
to grow a year's worth
of food,

16:54.700 --> 16:57.500
and so time becomes
critical to us.

17:05.467 --> 17:06.733
Son of a bitch.

17:08.467 --> 17:10.267
It's not gonna work.

17:13.733 --> 17:15.167
This is just too wide.

17:16.833 --> 17:18.000
Damn.

17:21.000 --> 17:23.700
Willows aren't long enough
for the spacing.

17:23.733 --> 17:27.067
I had that concern
when we first started
weaving them.

17:27.100 --> 17:28.867
KATE: I made a mistake.

17:28.900 --> 17:32.900
I was thinking the willows
were longer, and they weren't.

17:32.933 --> 17:37.900
So I don't have willows
long enough to support
this wide a spans.

17:39.267 --> 17:44.667
Now I've got to go just undo
everything that I've done.

17:44.700 --> 17:47.867
If you were to take this,
and put this in between
vertically like this.

17:47.900 --> 17:49.100
KATE: Yeah, that'll...

17:49.133 --> 17:50.633
ANDY: And it wouldn't even
have to go in that far.

17:50.667 --> 17:53.900
Because it's gonna
hold itself in there.

17:53.933 --> 17:55.767
I know that.
But I'm just...

17:55.800 --> 17:57.667
I'm just trying to suggest
things to you here, okay?

17:57.700 --> 17:59.267
-I know.
-I know you're frustrated
right now, so...

17:59.300 --> 18:00.900
I'm frustrated,
and I know that part.

18:00.933 --> 18:05.467
I know how to do this,
but I'm just saying
I just screwed up with the...

18:05.500 --> 18:07.033
No, that's not a screw-up.

18:07.067 --> 18:09.233
It's just a modification.
(CHUCKLES) That's all.

18:09.267 --> 18:13.000
So hand me another one there,
and we'll just see how
this works for a minute.

18:13.033 --> 18:17.200
KATE: Andy feels that
my original design
is not good enough.

18:17.233 --> 18:19.400
So, I'll change that.

18:20.167 --> 18:21.767
It's annoying.

18:21.800 --> 18:25.033
I just had a problem,
and I never had a chance to be
able to fix it on my own.

18:28.433 --> 18:29.567
(SOBS)

18:34.900 --> 18:36.633
He takes control
of everything.

18:36.667 --> 18:39.433
I mean, it just pisses me off.

18:49.233 --> 18:53.300
This is easier
than the other way.

18:53.333 --> 18:56.100
Yesterday I was really excited
to get my fence started.

18:56.133 --> 19:01.267
I was only in the first round,
and I realised that the sails
were too far apart.

19:01.300 --> 19:05.633
The mistake was that
the alders are not long enough
to make a tight weave.

19:05.667 --> 19:12.400
Andy decided that we'd put in
the middle uprights
with the alder branches.

19:12.433 --> 19:14.767
You know, I would've liked
to have figured it out

19:14.800 --> 19:17.033
and done it on my own,
which I would've.

19:17.067 --> 19:19.100
It's kind of hard
when someone steps
on your toes like that.

19:19.133 --> 19:20.500
I find it very upsetting.

19:20.533 --> 19:24.767
Just leave me alone,
but I feel better today.

19:24.800 --> 19:28.500
And I'm not gonna
let that get me down.
I'm gonna build my fence.

19:29.700 --> 19:31.500
Grr.

19:31.533 --> 19:34.200
SUE: Mother Nature
is gonna tell me where
I have to get things.

19:34.233 --> 19:35.600
I know what I need.

19:35.633 --> 19:37.500
I know I need to get it
from her.

19:37.533 --> 19:39.900
She's a fickle little thing
that likes to run and hide.

19:59.133 --> 20:00.300
(SPEAKING)

20:08.633 --> 20:11.300
NARRATOR: The absence
of caribou has Sue
chasing ptarmigan

20:11.333 --> 20:13.233
around the tundra for meat.

20:13.267 --> 20:17.967
She must harvest as many as
possible in order to fill her
freezer before winter returns.

20:18.000 --> 20:21.867
SUE: I don't wanna
get too close.
I don't wanna scare them.

20:21.900 --> 20:25.033
With this wind, unless
it's just a couple of feet
in front of me,

20:25.067 --> 20:28.167
it's just gonna take shots
and pellets and fling them
all over.

20:28.900 --> 20:30.333
Got him. Sweet!

20:35.233 --> 20:36.633
I got another one.

20:40.867 --> 20:42.300
Yes!

20:42.333 --> 20:43.733
Awesome.

20:47.900 --> 20:49.100
Well, got a couple.

20:50.333 --> 20:51.700
Go breast them out.

21:00.200 --> 21:01.800
Their skin is very thin.

21:01.833 --> 21:05.133
Just pull on them.
You want to sharpen up
your hunting skills,

21:05.167 --> 21:08.467
because a lot of things
are hunting these guys
right now.

21:08.500 --> 21:11.533
If I can see what
they're eating, I'm gonna know
where to look for them.

21:12.633 --> 21:14.267
Willow buds.

21:24.900 --> 21:27.467
So I got the heart
right there, and his breast.

21:28.567 --> 21:30.833
This is about as fresh
as you're gonna get it.

21:30.867 --> 21:31.933
Nice little meal.

21:32.533 --> 21:33.767
I better keep going.

21:55.633 --> 21:57.400
Here we go.
Another ptarmigan.

22:03.800 --> 22:06.333
That first shot got him.
He didn't go all that far.

22:06.367 --> 22:09.100
That's why I watched
what he was doing,
went over there.

22:09.133 --> 22:12.933
I thought, "Man, no way,
I'm not gonna have him suffer.
I'm gonna make sure."

22:12.967 --> 22:16.100
Pop him one more good time,
and take care
of this business.

22:22.033 --> 22:24.633
Get all the feathers off.
This is meat.

22:24.667 --> 22:28.733
Then again, I'm awfully
darn grateful for these
little guys. Thank you, buddy.

22:28.767 --> 22:33.367
But what I don't use,
I simply bring over there,

22:33.400 --> 22:36.533
and there's gonna be foxes
that are out here.

22:36.567 --> 22:38.200
All kinds of animals
will use that.

22:38.233 --> 22:42.300
So again, heart and breast.

22:42.333 --> 22:43.433
Yum, yum, yum.

22:46.567 --> 22:48.833
Colonel Sue-nders.

22:50.100 --> 22:51.133
Mmm!

22:53.867 --> 22:56.100
But there's nothing like
nice fresh meat.

22:56.133 --> 22:57.933
So, thank you, little birdies.

23:08.400 --> 23:10.467
We're not paying somebody
for it.

23:10.500 --> 23:12.933
We're doing the work ourselves
from start to end.

23:12.967 --> 23:15.267
And I wanna teach that
to my kids.

NARRATOR: The Hailstones
have settled into their
spring hunting grounds,

23:38.567 --> 23:41.267
and today Chip is giving
all five of his daughters

23:41.300 --> 23:43.900
a lesson in harvesting
waterfowl.

23:43.933 --> 23:45.400
This is bird season for us
right now.

23:45.433 --> 23:48.000
We're trying to nail
quite a few birds if we can.

23:48.033 --> 23:49.333
It's a fresh food
of the season.

23:49.367 --> 23:52.400
The birds are just migrating
in by the bazillions.

23:52.433 --> 23:57.167
And we haven't had birds here
since the beginning
of September last year.

23:57.200 --> 23:59.233
What we need to do now
is make a screen.

23:59.267 --> 24:01.233
You older girls
have done it before.

24:01.267 --> 24:03.433
You younger girls are gonna
have to watch,
and participate,

24:03.467 --> 24:04.733
you're gonna have to see
what it is we do.

24:04.767 --> 24:07.467
Just basically wanna make
a wall that you can
hide behind,

24:07.500 --> 24:09.967
so that when these birds
are flying by here

24:10.000 --> 24:12.800
they'll just see the wall
and then you can
stand up, and bam!

24:12.833 --> 24:13.933
You won't have the wall
in your way.

24:13.967 --> 24:16.000
So we're not gonna make it
too tall, okay?

24:17.333 --> 24:18.600
Ooh. Hey, puppy.

24:18.633 --> 24:20.733
CHIP: The blind is important
to keep the kids hidden.

24:20.767 --> 24:23.033
Birds can see very well
and they can see colour,

24:23.067 --> 24:24.900
so they need to be
hidden very well.

24:25.333 --> 24:26.900
(IDI SPEAKING)

24:26.933 --> 24:29.433

that they see the correct
blinds being made.

the wrong way.

And the younger ones
need to see it
and they need to interact.

24:38.933 --> 24:42.033
Well, I want the younger ones
to see what the older ones
are doing and to mimic them.

24:42.067 --> 24:44.500
I want them to learn.

24:44.533 --> 24:46.933

And then we'll shoot
anything else.

shoot them with the .22

26:11.767 --> 26:13.767

26:26.633 --> 26:28.367

26:39.367 --> 26:41.767

26:41.800 --> 26:43.367
-(CLICKS)
-There we go.

26:43.400 --> 26:45.067
I was going to shoot.

26:45.500 --> 26:47.133
(SPEAKING)

26:57.867 --> 27:00.033
ERIK: It's a really
beautiful place to live,

27:00.067 --> 27:04.100
and I really enjoy
what I do for a living,
and it's a great life.

27:04.133 --> 27:06.100
It's pretty wholesome.
It's what I choose.

27:16.133 --> 27:19.500
NARRATOR: With limited
hunting time before
his guiding season begins,

27:19.533 --> 27:23.033
Erik heads north
on a solo bear hunt.

27:23.067 --> 27:26.967
ERIK: Grizzly bear densities
aren't nearly as high as
coastal brown bear densities.

27:27.000 --> 27:29.133
Certain parts
of the Alaska peninsula,

27:29.167 --> 27:32.133
brown bear densities
are as high as one bear
per square mile.

27:32.167 --> 27:36.467
Now the grizzly bear density
is higher in this area than
it is in the Brooks Range.

27:36.500 --> 27:40.067
So it's not a walk
in the park.

27:44.467 --> 27:46.933
Here in Alaska
they have the same day
airborne law.

27:46.967 --> 27:48.633
So I can't hunt till tomorrow.

27:48.667 --> 27:50.533
Got my camp all set up
in the wind.

27:51.533 --> 27:52.700
It's gonna be
an early morning.

27:52.733 --> 27:56.233
It gets shooting light
about 5:15/5:30.

27:57.567 --> 28:01.067
I'm just gonna crash out
and grab a little
shut eye here,

28:01.100 --> 28:04.067
and hopefully there will be
lots of fun and adventure
tomorrow.

28:19.267 --> 28:21.733
Short night.
Not a whole lot of sleep.

28:21.767 --> 28:26.133
Have a little coffee,
and get out there,
and see what I can find.

28:31.433 --> 28:35.100
I originally got into guiding
'cause I loved to hunt.

28:35.133 --> 28:39.333
Unfortunately as the years
went on I did
less and less hunting

28:39.367 --> 28:42.900
'cause I was always working,
but I'm out here by myself.

28:42.933 --> 28:44.733
I don't have to worry
about anybody.

28:44.767 --> 28:46.833
I'm not responsible
for anybody.

28:46.867 --> 28:48.700
Just doing my own thing.

28:48.733 --> 28:50.267
This is freaking awesome.

29:05.700 --> 29:08.433
Got a set of bear tracks
coming down the hill here.

29:10.800 --> 29:15.133
So these bears we're hunting
here are interior grizzlies.

29:15.167 --> 29:19.000
They're the smaller of the two
subspecies of bears in Alaska,

29:19.033 --> 29:21.333
and these interior
grizzly bears,

29:21.367 --> 29:23.433
they're a more ferocious
mountain variety.

29:23.467 --> 29:27.767
They're very predatory.
They hunt moose, and caribou,
and stuff like that.

29:27.800 --> 29:30.933
They're kind of just like
a black bear on steroids.

29:30.967 --> 29:35.333
Time to make a shot,
stakes are high.

30:26.700 --> 30:28.267
When you're hunting
grizzly bears,

30:28.300 --> 30:30.533
it's a good rule of thumb
to take your time,

30:30.567 --> 30:32.733
get a good first shot.

30:33.933 --> 30:36.933
And then after that
it's the ethical thing to do,

30:36.967 --> 30:41.400
and the good insurance policy,
to just keep shooting until
you get him to stay still.

30:41.433 --> 30:44.233
Otherwise it's real easy
for him to get away from you.

30:48.867 --> 30:51.033
I see some blood
in the snow down there.

30:52.133 --> 30:55.800
I'm reloaded,
and I'm gonna ease my way
down there

30:55.833 --> 30:59.700
and see if I can't either
find a dead bear,
or finish it off.

31:17.100 --> 31:19.300
Really beautiful animal.

31:19.333 --> 31:22.733
Male, nice interior grizzly.

31:24.200 --> 31:27.767
The wind this morning
was extremely advantageous.

31:27.800 --> 31:30.933
The bear's number one
defence mechanism
towards predators,

31:30.967 --> 31:33.567
which is only man,
is this nose right here.

31:33.600 --> 31:35.833
He's got a heck
of a nose on him,

31:35.867 --> 31:39.400
and they can smell you
at several miles.

31:39.433 --> 31:41.900
That wind blowing
right in my face
as I approached the bear,

31:41.933 --> 31:43.467
he didn't have a chance
to smell me.

31:43.500 --> 31:46.033
So I was able to sneak
into that 150 yard mark,

31:46.067 --> 31:48.633
and make a nice shot on him
in the chest.

31:51.767 --> 31:54.833
Although I guide many,
many brown bear hunters

31:54.867 --> 31:56.667
and grizzly bear hunters
every year,

31:56.700 --> 31:59.033
I rarely get the opportunity
to come out on my own.

31:59.067 --> 32:02.067
To get out here and to get
to harvest a bear
is a neat thing.

32:02.100 --> 32:04.467
And it's always great
to get out here,

32:04.500 --> 32:08.300
and it's just... The whole
world is reawakening
after a long winter.

32:10.533 --> 32:13.300
SUE: One of the challenges
out here, you never know
what to expect.

32:13.333 --> 32:15.367
(CHUCKLES)
Expect the unexpected.

32:15.400 --> 32:17.700
You have to play
with the cards
you're dealt with.

32:17.733 --> 32:19.200
You don't get dealt
off the bottom of the deck.

32:28.900 --> 32:32.467
There's about a million ways
that you can prepare
ptarmigan.

32:32.500 --> 32:36.033
Basically, I cleaned them out
in the field pretty good.

32:36.067 --> 32:38.533
You're just gonna try and get

32:38.567 --> 32:44.233
as much of that meat
as close to the bone
as you can get it.

32:44.267 --> 32:46.433
What I'm doing now,
I'm just feeling
for little pellets.

32:46.467 --> 32:48.167
Making sure
they're out of there.

32:50.367 --> 32:52.100
It is a dark meat.

32:52.133 --> 32:54.167
It is a rich meat.

32:54.200 --> 32:57.767
It has a tendency to be
maybe a little bit tough.

32:58.900 --> 33:02.300
So I try to do things
to lessen that toughness.

33:04.300 --> 33:06.367
I mean, this was
a nice little hunt.

33:08.033 --> 33:10.000
You know,
I got a few of them.

33:10.033 --> 33:11.967
It was fun. They're tasty.

33:12.000 --> 33:16.100
A caribou is gonna give me
over a hundred pounds of meat.

33:17.333 --> 33:21.633
This is gonna give me
a couple of ounces of meat.

33:21.667 --> 33:25.800
So by no stretch
of the imagination

33:25.833 --> 33:28.967
am I done ptarmigan hunting
for the year.

33:29.000 --> 33:32.033
Will it take a lot more
dedication to fill my freezer
with it?

33:32.067 --> 33:33.500
Yup.

33:33.533 --> 33:36.967
And I've got about,
oh, I don't know,
three weeks left of the season

33:37.000 --> 33:41.300
before they shut it down
so that the little birdies
can do their wild thing,

33:41.333 --> 33:43.667
have their babies,
and teach them how to fly.

33:43.700 --> 33:48.667
And then it'll open up again
in late fall.

33:48.700 --> 33:54.133
But I intend on putting
a smack down on them
while I have the opportunity.

33:54.167 --> 33:55.767
Little bit more
labour intensive

33:55.800 --> 34:00.133
as far as the amount
of repetitious time I have
to do what I do.

34:00.167 --> 34:04.000
But I'm thankful
for every animal,

34:04.033 --> 34:07.067
every bit of food that I get
that helps sustain myself.

34:07.100 --> 34:11.367
Like I say, 290 to 300 days
is what I go through
by myself.

34:11.400 --> 34:14.967
I've got four little meals
that I can freeze
plus one to eat now.

34:15.000 --> 34:18.833
Take these bad boys off,
let them cool down...

34:21.500 --> 34:22.767
And there you go.

34:30.633 --> 34:32.300
Awesome!

34:32.333 --> 34:35.000
Yeah, the other day I missed
a whole lot of shots.

34:35.033 --> 34:37.700
Had a lot of fun, didn't put
anything in the freezer.

34:37.733 --> 34:40.000
But anytime that I can do this

34:40.033 --> 34:43.633
and help take care of myself,
I feel good about that.

34:43.667 --> 34:45.800
I got a long ways to go,

34:45.833 --> 34:49.467
but every little step
is a baby step
the right direction.

34:53.100 --> 34:54.733
CHIP: It's a good feeling
to provide for my family

34:54.767 --> 34:57.900
and it's a good feeling
to show my family how to
provide for themselves.

34:57.933 --> 34:59.267
And that's really my goal.

34:59.300 --> 35:01.367
Not just tell them about it
or let them read about it,

35:01.400 --> 35:03.100
I want them
to participate in it.

it was real sunny.

35:26.333 --> 35:29.767
It was the beginning
of the day, like the middle
of the day.

35:29.800 --> 35:32.233

When I was getting wood
I saw lots.

35:53.500 --> 35:56.233

better luck this way if you
girls wanna give it a try.

you hunt for a living.

If the animals aren't doing
what you want, where you want,

36:31.467 --> 36:34.700
you gotta go to where
they are and do it their way.

36:34.733 --> 36:36.233
That's just part of it all.

36:36.267 --> 36:38.633
This is a good experience
for my kids, I think.

36:38.667 --> 36:40.933
I like raising them this way.

you won't succeed.

we'll have tried.

up front, and then you can

have to grab it as I pass it,

Excellent, bun!
I'm so glad!

goose tonight!

to come get me.

a really long day,

39:11.700 --> 39:14.033
but I'm so happy with them
right now.

39:14.067 --> 39:16.533
And I'm gonna go
hear the stories a few times

39:16.567 --> 39:18.533
while she tells it
to everybody else.

39:18.567 --> 39:21.600
So, that's also
one of the better parts
of a good hunt,

39:21.633 --> 39:23.567
is being able to tell
the story afterward.

39:23.600 --> 39:24.767
No bragging.

39:24.800 --> 39:26.233
Bragging is entirely wrong,

39:26.267 --> 39:30.167
but now, honestly,
I can send her off to go
goose hunt that way

39:30.200 --> 39:33.133
while I go goose hunt
that way. (LAUGHS)

kind of stuff, somebody is
gonna be productive.

39:36.433 --> 39:37.967
And we're all gonna benefit.

39:38.000 --> 39:40.333

another step in her life

that she's really
taken up to really well.

you really need

second, third, fourth,

39:52.900 --> 39:55.133
right up to one thousandth.

39:55.167 --> 39:58.733

little things that you always
gotta be mindful of.

for you, Shilling.

40:15.767 --> 40:18.433
-You like it?
-Yeah.

40:18.467 --> 40:20.600
Come here, Shilling.
You wanna go
through this fence?

40:20.633 --> 40:22.633
-KATE: No.
-He says,
"I can't get through that.

40:22.667 --> 40:24.967
"I can't get through that."

40:25.000 --> 40:28.967
(LAUGHS) I think that'll work
really good.

40:29.000 --> 40:32.233
Looks like it'll let
the light in, and it'll keep
the dogs out.

40:32.267 --> 40:33.467
I'm tired.

40:33.500 --> 40:35.833
Yeah, you did a good job
on that.

40:36.400 --> 40:37.867
Thank you.

40:37.900 --> 40:39.567
ANDY: Kate did a great job
on this.

40:39.600 --> 40:43.667
You know, I'm real proud
of her for sticking
to the job.

40:43.700 --> 40:46.800
It's a big job, and we talked
about it for a long time,

40:46.833 --> 40:50.100
and it's kind of nice
to finally see it happen.

40:50.133 --> 40:52.333
And just cost us
time and labour,

40:52.367 --> 40:57.533
and, you know, that's part
of living out here is adapting
to whatever happens.

40:57.567 --> 40:59.567
It's frustrating at times,

40:59.600 --> 41:03.567
but if you're afraid of that
then you don't belong
out here.

41:03.600 --> 41:05.533
-Well...
-There's my boy.

41:05.567 --> 41:07.200
I've got a little surprise
for you.

41:07.233 --> 41:08.300
-You do?
-Yeah.

41:08.333 --> 41:09.933
Oh, okay. I like surprises.

41:09.967 --> 41:11.867
-Down by the river.
-Okay.

41:11.900 --> 41:13.133
Something relaxing.

41:13.167 --> 41:15.267
I'm tired.
I don't wanna go do
any more work.

41:15.300 --> 41:16.700
(LAUGHS)

41:21.700 --> 41:25.100
Pina coladas made out
of Yukon River ice, and, uh...

41:26.300 --> 41:28.700
This year the ice
went away pretty quick.

41:28.733 --> 41:31.000
Uh... Not much left,

41:31.033 --> 41:36.133
and so time is short for
making Yuko-ladas. (LAUGHS)

41:36.167 --> 41:38.000
That'll make a fire.

41:40.500 --> 41:42.233
The Olympic torch.

41:42.800 --> 41:43.967
ANDY: Here we go.

41:44.000 --> 41:46.233
-All right. I'm ready.
-To an easy break-up.

41:46.767 --> 41:48.167
KATE: Yee-haw!

41:52.600 --> 41:54.467
ANDY: The gasoline evaporated.

41:57.833 --> 41:59.733
Yuko-ladas!

41:59.767 --> 42:01.567
Yuko-ladas!

42:01.600 --> 42:03.633
-ANDY: Are you happy
with your fence?
-Yeah.

42:04.533 --> 42:06.100
I finally got a wattle fence.

42:06.133 --> 42:08.700
And I think you did
a good job.
Turned out good.

42:08.733 --> 42:10.333
My next one will be better.

42:10.367 --> 42:13.567
(LAUGHS) I don't know
how many more of those
I wanna build.

42:15.167 --> 42:16.467
Good job.

42:16.900 --> 42:18.133
Thank you.

42:21.667 --> 42:25.933
You know, we're not
getting any younger,
it's kind of sad,

42:25.967 --> 42:28.867
but, you know,
now we're doing the heaviest
of the heaviest of work

42:29.500 --> 42:31.733
when we're getting older.

42:31.767 --> 42:36.067
I don't think either one of us
are ready to roll over
and say, "Never mind."

42:36.100 --> 42:37.733
That's never gonna happen.

42:37.767 --> 42:41.167
This is a dream...

42:41.200 --> 42:43.100
This is our dream,

42:44.600 --> 42:46.667
and it's gonna happen,

42:46.700 --> 42:48.200
or we'll die trying.

42:48.967 --> 42:50.500
Well, Andy.

42:50.533 --> 42:53.567
Here's to our new garden,
and hope it brings
plentiful bounty.

42:53.600 --> 42:54.733
(LAUGHS)

42:59.400 --> 43:01.167
(BOTH EXCLAIMING)
