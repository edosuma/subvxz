18:57.891 --> 19:00.155
Tell me something, uh...

19:00.227 --> 19:02.991
Dan. Danny.
Danny Wright.

19:03.063 --> 19:05.031
Garrison & Wright.

19:06.733 --> 19:09.964
Tell me something,
Danny Wright.

19:10.036 --> 19:11.401
Yes, sir.

19:13.039 --> 19:16.133
Why the hell do you care
why I'm in Mexico?

19:16.810 --> 19:19.711
- Why so interested, huh?
- No reason. Just...

19:20.647 --> 19:23.480
...hotel bar conversation, I guess.

19:23.550 --> 19:25.074
Are you with the farm?

19:25.152 --> 19:27.313
- What's that?
- The agency?

19:27.387 --> 19:29.582
- What?
- Are you following me?

19:29.656 --> 19:31.556
- No, no.
- Did I make you?

19:31.625 --> 19:33.525
I have no idea
what you're talk...

19:33.593 --> 19:36.153
Did I fucking make you? Hm?

19:36.229 --> 19:39.027
OK. I'm going to excuse myself.

19:39.799 --> 19:42.199
- I have to go, thank you.
- No. No, please.

19:42.269 --> 19:44.294
No, I'm really tired.

19:44.371 --> 19:46.965
No, no, please.
I didn't mean to weird you out.

19:47.040 --> 19:50.567
I just get paranoid sometimes.
I was wrong. Please.

19:52.179 --> 19:54.704
I'm drunk. I'm tired.

19:54.781 --> 19:57.147
I've been fornicating
for the last two hours,

19:57.217 --> 19:59.310
and, before that,
I was doing shit...

19:59.386 --> 20:01.581
Horrible business shit...

20:01.655 --> 20:02.952
Please... come on.

20:03.023 --> 20:04.422
I was out of order.

20:04.491 --> 20:06.459
Let's finish our drink.
Come on.

20:06.526 --> 20:07.720
Here you go.

20:07.794 --> 20:10.024
Here you are.
Here's your drink.

20:10.096 --> 20:11.563
Danny?
Here you go.

20:11.631 --> 20:14.191
I mean, you seem
like a nice guy.

20:14.267 --> 20:16.701
You know, a normal guy.

20:17.470 --> 20:18.732
I'm sorry.

20:21.374 --> 20:23.842
Really, it's all right.

20:24.444 --> 20:25.638
So...

20:26.947 --> 20:28.642
...you in town on business?

20:28.715 --> 20:29.704
Hm?

20:29.783 --> 20:31.808
You have that way
about you, Danny.

20:38.091 --> 20:40.491
[cockney accent]
Why are you so interested?

20:41.995 --> 20:44.156
[both laugh]

20:44.231 --> 20:46.222
It's... it's...

20:46.299 --> 20:47.891
- Very good.
- Yeah?

20:47.968 --> 20:49.799
Ah, very good.

20:49.869 --> 20:51.803
Oh, I'm here on business.

20:51.871 --> 20:53.031
Is it going well?

20:53.106 --> 20:54.505
Very well, I hope.

20:54.574 --> 20:57.372
My... my partner and I...
He's upstairs.

20:57.444 --> 21:01.175
...we just had
a very good pitch session.

21:01.248 --> 21:02.442
No shit?

21:02.515 --> 21:03.914
Very good.

21:03.984 --> 21:06.214
Well, that's fantastic.

21:06.286 --> 21:07.776
That's great, Danny.

21:07.854 --> 21:09.151
I needed a day like this.

21:09.222 --> 21:10.280
I hear ya.

21:10.357 --> 21:13.292
I've had a tough couple years.

21:13.360 --> 21:17.421
I was with this business
out of Denver for nine years.

21:17.497 --> 21:20.091
And out of the blue they just...

21:21.868 --> 21:23.563
- They laid me off.
- Oh...

21:23.803 --> 21:25.464
Yeah. Just like that.

21:25.538 --> 21:28.200
And it was, I don't know,
two and a half years ago.

21:28.275 --> 21:31.767
- I've been struggling back ever since.
- And today you got back.

21:31.845 --> 21:33.938
Well, I hope.

21:35.015 --> 21:37.916
Today you're a man again.

21:39.185 --> 21:40.618
Yeah.

21:40.687 --> 21:44.316
And to be a man,
after they fuck you

21:44.391 --> 21:47.519
and destroy your self-respect...

21:48.762 --> 21:51.026
Well, that is a great thing.

21:51.965 --> 21:53.899
Thank you.

21:55.168 --> 21:56.965
<i>Dos margaritas, por favor.</i>

22:00.440 --> 22:01.873
Are you married, Danny?

22:01.941 --> 22:04.603
Oh, yeah, I am.
Fourteen years.

22:04.678 --> 22:08.045
Oh... let me guess.
High school sweetheart.

22:08.114 --> 22:09.877
It's true.

22:09.949 --> 22:11.814
Unbelievable.

22:11.885 --> 22:14.353
The fuckin' American dream, huh?

22:14.421 --> 22:16.218
Yeah. What about you?

22:16.289 --> 22:18.484
What do you do for a living?

22:20.860 --> 22:22.191
Any kids?

22:22.262 --> 22:24.321
You got kids, Danny?

22:26.099 --> 22:27.589
Oh, no.
I crossed the line.

22:27.834 --> 22:29.301
No, no, no. You did not.

22:29.369 --> 22:31.269
- I did.
- You did not cross the line.

22:31.338 --> 22:32.600
- It's fine.
- I'm sorry.

22:32.839 --> 22:34.101
It's fine.

22:41.748 --> 22:44.410
We lost our son three years ago.

22:48.888 --> 22:50.879
It was a school bus accident.

22:52.759 --> 22:55.455
Fourteen children lived that day...

22:55.528 --> 22:57.120
...and one died.

23:01.434 --> 23:02.833
That was Henry.

23:06.706 --> 23:07.968
We, uh...

23:08.842 --> 23:10.469
...had a bad run for a while.

23:10.543 --> 23:13.671
Two Mexicans walk into a cantina.

23:14.748 --> 23:16.045
What?

23:16.116 --> 23:17.879
Two Mexicans walk into a cantina.

23:17.951 --> 23:21.114
One's a midget, and the other's got
a dick 15 inches long.

23:21.187 --> 23:23.314
W-what are you saying?

23:23.390 --> 23:26.917
I'm trying to change the subject.
The midget says to the bartender,

23:26.993 --> 23:29.359
"They call my <i>amigo</i>
the human swizzle stick.

23:29.429 --> 23:31.454
You know what they
call me?"

23:32.632 --> 23:33.792
This is incredible.

23:33.867 --> 23:35.129
What?

23:37.036 --> 23:38.936
You're... very rude.

23:39.005 --> 23:40.802
I'm trying to change the subject.

23:40.874 --> 23:43.274
Thank you very much
for the drink.

23:43.343 --> 23:45.368
Goodbye. Good night.
Thank you.

23:47.180 --> 23:49.478
Don't you wanna hear the punchline?

23:53.953 --> 23:57.411
It's a fucking good one.

No, no, get outta here.
You're the one with the kids.

25:06.960 --> 25:08.621
You're the one with the tree.

25:08.695 --> 25:11.755
You wanna flip another coin?
Somebody's gotta stay for now.

25:11.831 --> 25:14.857
- I'll call you the minute I hear.
- Call me sooner.

25:14.934 --> 25:16.401
- Oh, God.
- What?

25:16.469 --> 25:19.063
My cell phone.
I think I left it at the front desk.

25:19.138 --> 25:21.971
- Watch my stuff for a sec?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.

25:22.976 --> 25:24.910
- [Julian] Staying a few days?
- What?

25:24.978 --> 25:27.208
I couldn't help but overhear.

25:27.280 --> 25:28.611
Yeah. So you're spying

25:28.681 --> 25:31.081
on my personal conversations
now, huh? Great.

25:31.150 --> 25:34.847
Something about the asshole buyers
not being completely convinced.

25:34.921 --> 25:37.014
And now wanted to hear
other pitches?

25:37.090 --> 25:38.182
Pfff!

25:38.258 --> 25:40.249
Sorry about that.

25:41.027 --> 25:44.360
I-I knew things
were too good to be true anyway.

25:44.430 --> 25:47.991
I'm sorry about the circumstances,
but I'm glad you're still in town.

25:48.067 --> 25:51.434
It gives me the opportunity to tell you
how truly embarrassed I am

25:51.504 --> 25:55.406
about last night.
See? See, the thing is...

25:57.477 --> 25:58.910
I liked you.

25:58.978 --> 26:01.947
I kind of enjoyed
talking to someone, you know,

26:02.015 --> 26:03.812
just... talking.

26:03.883 --> 26:05.282
- Really?
- Yeah.

26:08.087 --> 26:10.248
And yet...

26:11.291 --> 26:13.350
I tell you about my dead son,

26:13.426 --> 26:15.121
and you mock it.

26:18.498 --> 26:20.966
I lost my wife.

26:22.235 --> 26:25.398
I was 24 years old,
I was drunk,

26:25.471 --> 26:27.837
I plowed our car
into an oak tree.

26:27.907 --> 26:29.067
Jesus.

26:30.843 --> 26:35.212
Since then, I've soiled
my way through life,

26:35.281 --> 26:37.749
been a magnificently cold moron.

26:38.618 --> 26:41.246
I run away from anything
that resembles an emotion.

26:41.321 --> 26:43.687
Thus, you tell me
about your dead son,

26:43.756 --> 26:46.850
I tell you a joke
about a 15-inch schlong.

26:49.696 --> 26:51.323
So you can forgive me, huh?

26:51.397 --> 26:52.864
[Phil] Got it!

26:52.932 --> 26:56.129
Better I remember it now
than somewhere over Amarillo.

26:56.202 --> 26:57.396
Right.

26:57.470 --> 26:59.404
All right.
Speak to you <i>ma√±ana,</i> right?

26:59.472 --> 27:00.496
Yeah, yeah.

27:00.740 --> 27:02.731
- It's gonna be all right.
- I know.

27:10.350 --> 27:11.749
Danny?
Hey, Danny.

27:11.818 --> 27:13.752
Wait. Hey.

27:13.820 --> 27:16.880
I've got an extra ticket to
the bullfights this afternoon.

27:16.956 --> 27:18.548
Supposed to be a good one.

27:18.791 --> 27:21.783
It would mean a great deal
to me if you would join me.

27:21.861 --> 27:23.829
Oh, I'm so...
Thank you.

27:23.896 --> 27:26.456
Thank you very much.
That's very nice of you,

27:26.532 --> 27:28.500
and I... I can't.

27:28.568 --> 27:30.058
I can't. I have work.

27:30.136 --> 27:32.627
On a Sunday afternoon?

27:32.705 --> 27:33.865
Ever seen a bullfight?

27:35.274 --> 27:36.741
No.

27:36.809 --> 27:40.540
You haven't seen the real Mexico City
until you've seen a bullfight.

27:43.416 --> 27:45.407
Come on.

28:33.766 --> 28:35.358
I can't wait to tell her.

28:35.435 --> 28:38.563
[laughs] Where did you
ever find a woman like that?

28:38.638 --> 28:40.629
A woman you can share
everything with.

28:40.707 --> 28:42.368
She's pretty special.

28:42.442 --> 28:43.602
You must be too.

28:43.676 --> 28:47.271
- I could learn from you.
- [scoffs] Learn what?

28:47.346 --> 28:49.746
You want my mortgage,
my blood pressure?

28:49.816 --> 28:52.011
I've never had
my blood pressure taken,

28:52.085 --> 28:54.178
and I wouldn't know
how to get a mortgage

28:54.253 --> 28:56.278
for all the teenage twat
in Thailand.

28:56.355 --> 28:57.822
You don't own a house?

28:57.890 --> 28:58.879
No house.

28:58.958 --> 29:01.722
No apartment, no address.

29:02.762 --> 29:06.459
- You bullshittin' me?
- I shit you not. Montecristo?

29:07.100 --> 29:08.829
Uh... yeah!

29:08.901 --> 29:10.198
Thanks.

29:10.269 --> 29:13.102
You don't have a permanent address?
Where do you live?

29:13.172 --> 29:16.505
- I live wherever I'm working.
- So, what do you do, Julian?

29:16.743 --> 29:20.406
What do you possibly do you don't have
a permanent home or an address?

29:25.084 --> 29:26.449
I'd rather not say.

29:28.254 --> 29:30.313
Oh, my God,
did you see that?

29:30.389 --> 29:32.857
Jeez, it's so bloody.

29:32.925 --> 29:35.189
We're lucky.
That matador was very good.

29:35.261 --> 29:37.354
It's much worse
when they're mediocre.

29:37.430 --> 29:39.364
- Why?
- A great matador,

29:39.432 --> 29:42.196
he can kill the bull with
one plunge of the blade.

29:42.268 --> 29:44.133
A lesser one,
he's going to have to

29:44.203 --> 29:45.932
plunge that blade
more than once.

29:46.005 --> 29:48.496
That makes the crowd
very unhappy.

29:48.574 --> 29:50.701
They don't like to see
the bull suffer.

29:50.777 --> 29:51.835
No.

29:51.911 --> 29:56.871
No, no. They clearly care
so very much about these animals.

29:56.949 --> 29:58.610
They respect these beasts.

29:58.684 --> 30:01.152
They want 'em to die with honor.

30:01.220 --> 30:03.814
That's ridiculous.
There's no honor in being killed

30:03.890 --> 30:06.358
by a man with a sword
whether it's one plunge or 20.

30:06.425 --> 30:07.858
Ah, you're wrong.

30:07.927 --> 30:09.258
You're very wrong.

30:09.328 --> 30:10.920
There is honor.

30:10.997 --> 30:12.259
How would you know?

30:14.700 --> 30:16.190
I do.

30:19.438 --> 30:21.372
You're a mysterious man, Julian.

30:21.440 --> 30:22.702
Mm-hm.

30:22.775 --> 30:24.606
[cheering]

30:25.745 --> 30:26.734
[bull roars]

30:26.813 --> 30:31.546
- [Danny] You won't tell me what you do?
- It's... confidential.

30:32.752 --> 30:33.878
Confidential?

30:33.953 --> 30:36.114
What, do you work
for the government?

30:36.189 --> 30:38.214
The government?
Pfff! Please.

30:38.291 --> 30:39.758
You know what they pay?

30:39.826 --> 30:42.989
Hmph! Forget it.
Watch the picadors.

30:43.062 --> 30:46.793
- You a spy? Something like that?
- You read too many novels, Danny.

30:46.866 --> 30:49.027
Huh? You a spy?

30:49.101 --> 30:50.864
Huh?

30:54.807 --> 30:57.207
So now you're not going
to tell me. It's OK.

30:57.276 --> 30:59.107
It's OK.

30:59.178 --> 31:00.543
All right.

31:01.881 --> 31:03.644
Hm. All right.

31:05.117 --> 31:07.381
If I tell you,
will you keep your cool?

31:07.453 --> 31:09.387
- What do you mean?
- We're in public,

31:09.455 --> 31:11.423
and I don't want you
to lose your shit.

31:12.491 --> 31:14.891
Lose my shit?

31:14.961 --> 31:17.657
My God, w-what
are you gonna tell me?

31:17.730 --> 31:20.164
Sometimes...

31:25.204 --> 31:26.603
Sometimes what?

31:26.839 --> 31:29.171
Sometimes...

31:29.242 --> 31:31.836
...people need to be eliminated.

31:34.847 --> 31:36.815
Oh, come on!

31:36.883 --> 31:38.783
[chuckling]

31:39.852 --> 31:41.444
What? You're...

31:41.520 --> 31:43.112
- You're a hit man?
- Oh, please.

31:43.189 --> 31:46.317
Please. My handler...

31:46.392 --> 31:48.519
...calls me a facilitator.

31:48.594 --> 31:51.085
A facilitator of fatalities.

31:51.163 --> 31:52.824
That's insane.

31:52.899 --> 31:54.264
Think what you like.

31:54.333 --> 31:56.062
I gotta hand it to ya, Julian,

31:56.135 --> 31:59.764
you're one of the best bullshit artists
I've met, and I've met some.

31:59.839 --> 32:02.967
You're absolutely right, Danny.
My name is Earl Johnson.

32:03.042 --> 32:05.636
I sell aluminum siding
in Minneapolis.

32:08.581 --> 32:12.244
- You actually kill people for a living?
- I do what I'm asked to do.

32:12.318 --> 32:13.808
What makes sense to me.

32:13.886 --> 32:15.751
For like, the Mob?

32:15.821 --> 32:18.517
I tend to be hired
on the more kind of

32:18.591 --> 32:21.253
anonymous high-paying jobs.

32:21.327 --> 32:23.261
Corporate gigs.

32:24.764 --> 32:26.698
Corporate gigs?

32:26.766 --> 32:30.167
I'm a great helper
in getting deals closed.

32:34.040 --> 32:36.736
I don't believe you.
I don't believe you.

32:36.809 --> 32:40.472
- I don't believe in the Easter Bunny.
- I don't believe you.

32:40.546 --> 32:42.514
Come on! Corporate gigs.

32:42.581 --> 32:44.446
- Think what you will.
- Ridiculous.

32:44.517 --> 32:45.984
- Yes!
- Corporate gigs.

32:46.052 --> 32:48.452
Yes! My God...

32:48.521 --> 32:51.854
I knew there was a reason
I never told anyone what I did.

32:51.924 --> 32:53.585
Uh-huh.

32:53.659 --> 32:55.593
All right, see that guy over there?

32:55.661 --> 32:57.561
- Fat man and little girl?
- Yeah.

32:57.630 --> 32:59.359
Say I wanted him dead.

32:59.432 --> 33:02.230
I want him dead, his family dead.
Dead. Right now.

33:02.301 --> 33:04.531
- Right here.
- Right now? Couldn't happen.

33:04.603 --> 33:06.594
I know, but say that it could.

33:06.672 --> 33:08.162
- Money's no object.
- OK.

33:08.240 --> 33:11.107
- You sure you wanna know?
- Yeah.

33:11.177 --> 33:12.838
- Yeah, you sure?
- Yeah.

33:12.912 --> 33:15.073
I want you to facilitate it.

33:16.382 --> 33:18.043
OK, Danny.

33:18.117 --> 33:19.584
All right, come with me.

33:19.652 --> 33:21.517
- Huh?
- Let's go.

33:23.255 --> 33:25.655
[crowd] <i>Ol√©!</i>

33:25.725 --> 33:28.091
<i>Ol√©!</i>

33:28.160 --> 33:31.425
<i>Ol√©!</i>

33:31.497 --> 33:33.362
<i>Ol√©!</i>

33:34.600 --> 33:38.161
I'm a big fan of the gotta-pee theory
of assassinations.

33:38.237 --> 33:40.034
Gotta pee?

33:40.106 --> 33:41.630
Everyone's gotta pee.

33:41.707 --> 33:43.140
Ah.

33:43.209 --> 33:44.836
Now...

33:44.910 --> 33:46.810
...ask me for a cigarette.

33:46.879 --> 33:49.404
- What?
- Do it.

33:49.482 --> 33:51.416
Can I have a cigarette, please?

33:51.484 --> 33:54.976
Sure. But these things'll
kill ya, you know. [laughs]

33:56.856 --> 33:58.517
Now, look around.

34:00.760 --> 34:01.852
[coughs]

34:01.927 --> 34:03.554
They're scary.

34:03.629 --> 34:05.494
- Yes and no.
- Why?

34:05.564 --> 34:08.362
They seem more interested
in the beautiful women

34:08.434 --> 34:10.493
coming and going
from the ladies' room.

34:10.569 --> 34:11.763
That's good for us.

34:11.837 --> 34:14.806
Just like those men over there
at the concession stand.

34:14.873 --> 34:16.501
They're only interested in us

34:16.574 --> 34:19.339
if they see us walking over
with our wallets open.

34:19.411 --> 34:21.880
No one is watching
the men's room.

34:21.947 --> 34:23.414
The gotta-pee theory.

34:23.482 --> 34:24.676
You're catching on.

34:24.750 --> 34:26.877
Now, escape routes.

34:26.952 --> 34:29.476
- Escape routes?
- Don't wanna get caught, right?

34:29.554 --> 34:30.987
Don't get caught, it sucks.

34:31.056 --> 34:32.422
- See the main exit?
- Yeah.

34:32.491 --> 34:33.788
That's a traffic jam.

34:33.859 --> 34:36.521
- Where else?
- You tell me.

34:36.594 --> 34:37.721
OK, OK.

34:37.797 --> 34:39.628
Uh, that door over there.

34:39.697 --> 34:41.324
If it... if it weren't locked.

34:41.400 --> 34:44.527
Vietnamese girl I once knew
had her legs so locked together

34:44.603 --> 34:46.730
I couldn't get a whiff
of her spring roll.

34:46.806 --> 34:50.867
Two drinks, half a Quaalude later,
I was at an all-you-can eat buffet.

34:50.943 --> 34:52.774
Every lock can be broken.

34:52.844 --> 34:55.973
It's just a matter of will
and whether it's worth it.

34:58.150 --> 35:01.313
This looks like it's worth it.

35:01.387 --> 35:03.321
[Julian] <i>Uno cigarillos, por favor.</i>

35:03.389 --> 35:06.324
Why are we buying the cigarettes?

35:06.392 --> 35:08.292
'Cause I wanna smoke.

35:08.360 --> 35:09.418
<i>Gracias.</i>

35:09.495 --> 35:11.656
Come over here.

35:11.730 --> 35:14.460
Now do your shoelaces up.

35:19.939 --> 35:22.999
What time's our flight
to Florida, Seymour?

35:24.243 --> 35:26.473
I think 2:00, Derrick.

35:30.850 --> 35:32.943
Let's go, Seymour.

35:43.562 --> 35:45.427
[cheering]

35:58.277 --> 35:59.767
Holy shit!

35:59.845 --> 36:01.836
[chuckles]

36:28.007 --> 36:30.066
[crowd cheering]

36:43.822 --> 36:45.517
- You ready?
- Ready for what?

36:45.591 --> 36:47.354
You wanted to see
what I do, right?

36:47.426 --> 36:49.621
Yes.

36:49.695 --> 36:51.390
Yes, I've been watching.

36:51.463 --> 36:54.455
- But, you know...
- What? Show-and-tell is over.

36:54.533 --> 36:56.797
The real deal is about to start.

36:56.869 --> 36:58.860
- The real deal?
- Mm-hm.

37:01.073 --> 37:02.836
Show-and-tell is for sissies.

37:02.908 --> 37:04.671
But a sissy I'm not.

37:06.612 --> 37:08.580
- Come on!
- My God, fire!

37:08.647 --> 37:11.047
- Come on. It's a distraction.
- Are you crazy?

37:11.116 --> 37:14.608
Fire or tits, either one will
distract most cops.

37:14.687 --> 37:16.814
Are you ready to finish
what we started?

37:16.889 --> 37:19.653
That was extremely dangerous.
You proved your point.

37:19.725 --> 37:20.987
Baloney! Baloney!

37:21.060 --> 37:23.460
The cops may have
gone towards the fire,

37:23.529 --> 37:26.760
- but his bodyguard probably stood firm.
- Bodyguard?

37:26.832 --> 37:29.062
If I'm asked to kill,
they have a bodyguard.

37:29.134 --> 37:30.999
If they didn't, they'd ask you.

37:31.070 --> 37:33.470
So I slit the guard's throat
in one move,

37:33.539 --> 37:35.700
push him into the bathroom...

37:35.774 --> 37:38.038
And now we're set up for the kill.

37:42.948 --> 37:44.973
Where the hell
did you get the knife?

37:45.050 --> 37:47.416
He's not peeing,
so it must be number <i>dos.</i>

37:47.486 --> 37:49.852
OK, joke's over.
Point made, Julian.

37:49.922 --> 37:52.413
- Not yet. Not yet.
- Point made.

37:52.491 --> 37:54.755
The point's made.
Let's get out of here...

37:54.827 --> 37:57.796
Don't fuckin' ruin things,
OK? Don't do it.

38:04.703 --> 38:06.295
OK. Julian?

38:06.372 --> 38:08.602
I'm asking you to stop this!

38:08.674 --> 38:10.198
No way, job's not done.

38:10.276 --> 38:11.504
But this is not a job!

38:11.577 --> 38:14.011
You said money was no object!

38:15.547 --> 38:17.174
# <i>Bingo was his name-o</i> #

38:17.249 --> 38:18.773
- This is want you wanted?
- No!

38:18.851 --> 38:20.648
- You helped me.
- I didn't help you!

38:20.719 --> 38:21.981
Oh, yes, you did!

38:22.054 --> 38:23.715
- Oh, yes, you did!
- No! No, no.

38:27.092 --> 38:28.650
Oh, God, no!

38:31.196 --> 38:33.391
Oh! <i>Disculpa me, por favor.</i>

38:33.465 --> 38:34.830
<i>Lo siento.</i>

38:39.071 --> 38:40.095
Fun, huh?

38:40.172 --> 38:42.072
[laughing]

38:42.141 --> 38:45.167
Come on. [laughing]

38:45.244 --> 38:48.179
[Danny] Whoo-hoo!
That was incredible!

38:48.247 --> 38:51.148
- You scared the hell out of me!
- You liked that. You did?

38:51.216 --> 38:53.980
- I really bought it!
- What, that I'd stab a stranger?

38:54.053 --> 38:55.680
[laughing] I don't know.

38:55.754 --> 38:58.518
Just like that?
A complete stranger?

38:58.590 --> 39:00.217
Well, yes!
Yes, I did.

39:00.292 --> 39:02.192
- I'm not psychotic.
- No, I know.

39:02.261 --> 39:05.753
- Psychopathic, not psychotic.
- I don't think you're a psychopath.

39:05.831 --> 39:08.994
Well, I kill people. Doesn't that
seem a wee bit psychopathic?

39:09.068 --> 39:10.558
Well, yeah, but...

39:10.636 --> 39:12.763
- Don't get the wrong impression.
- Huh?

39:12.838 --> 39:15.671
Because we share a laugh
doesn't mean I'm not unsavory.

39:15.741 --> 39:18.437
No, what you do is unsavory.

39:18.510 --> 39:21.035
You know what they say.
You are what you do.

39:37.563 --> 39:39.292
<i>Gracias.</i>

39:39.365 --> 39:40.730
<i>Gracias.</i>

39:42.368 --> 39:44.529
Tell me...

39:46.238 --> 39:49.605
...will Bean stay with you if
this job doesn't come through?

39:50.409 --> 39:52.536
- What?
- Will Bean stay with you

39:52.611 --> 39:55.910
if you continue this losing streak
without any end?

39:55.981 --> 39:58.142
If she ever left me
I'd fall apart...

39:58.217 --> 40:01.084
You're not answering my question.

40:03.255 --> 40:05.746
To be quite honest...

40:06.425 --> 40:09.394
...I don't know how much faith
the woman has left in her.

40:10.963 --> 40:13.431
[sighs] Hey.

40:13.499 --> 40:15.023
Hey.

40:16.635 --> 40:17.863
Comforting me?

40:19.905 --> 40:23.363
- Hey.
- Let's change the subject. Please.

40:23.442 --> 40:25.069
- I agree.
- Something sunnier.

40:25.144 --> 40:26.577
Sunnier.

40:27.346 --> 40:29.177
Absolutely.

40:29.248 --> 40:31.512
There's something
I wanted to talk about.

40:31.583 --> 40:33.414
- It's a favor, really.
- Sure.

40:33.485 --> 40:35.453
It's big, if that's OK.
A big favor.

40:35.521 --> 40:36.647
No, it's OK.

40:36.722 --> 40:39.282
See, the thing is...

40:39.358 --> 40:41.189
...I could use your help.

40:41.260 --> 40:43.023
Help in what?

40:43.095 --> 40:44.528
I'm down here,

40:44.763 --> 40:47.789
I finished my other job early,
so I let it be known.

40:47.866 --> 40:49.333
You let it be known?

40:49.401 --> 40:52.837
Yeah, to the powers that be,
that I was available.

40:52.905 --> 40:55.135
- The powers that be?
- Yeah.

40:55.207 --> 40:58.472
Anyway, they called me up.
An urgent thing. Has to happen today.

40:58.544 --> 41:00.944
An-another job?

41:01.013 --> 41:02.275
Mm-hm.

41:02.347 --> 41:03.939
Jesus Christ.

41:04.016 --> 41:07.816
The thing is, I could
really use your help.

41:10.355 --> 41:11.879
Oh! [laughs]

41:12.991 --> 41:14.959
You're kidding right now.

41:15.027 --> 41:17.825
I'm as serious
as an erection problem.

41:17.896 --> 41:19.921
- I mean, I...
<i>- Gracias.</i>

41:19.998 --> 41:22.523
I can't help you, Julian.

41:22.601 --> 41:24.000
You could.

41:24.069 --> 41:25.730
Well, I could, but I-I can't,

41:25.804 --> 41:27.863
I'm not gonna help
kill an innocent man.

41:27.940 --> 41:30.340
- Who says he's innocent?
- This is ridiculous.

41:30.409 --> 41:31.637
- Just assisting.
- No!

41:31.710 --> 41:33.701
- You'd just have to...
- No, no, no, no!

41:33.779 --> 41:36.509
I'm not listening.
I can't hear you. I can't hear you.

41:36.582 --> 41:38.311
- Bup...
- You're being childish.

41:38.383 --> 41:40.283
Ooga-shacka, ooga-shacka...

41:40.352 --> 41:42.013
- Not listening.
- Childish.

41:42.087 --> 41:44.578
You're being childish.
All I'm asking you...

41:44.656 --> 41:47.181
- Ta, ta, ta, ta, ta!
- All right. All right.

41:47.259 --> 41:48.658
I won't tell you.

41:49.361 --> 41:50.760
- Good.
- Won't mention it.

41:50.829 --> 41:52.228
- Great.
- I won't say that

41:52.297 --> 41:54.265
all you have to do
is trip on the street.

41:54.333 --> 41:57.530
- I can't believe you just said that.
- Just trip in half an hour

41:57.603 --> 42:00.538
- so his bodyguards look the other way.
- No way.

42:02.641 --> 42:05.201
Fifty thousand dollars
is what I could pay you.

42:05.277 --> 42:06.869
- No.
- A lot of money. Cash.

42:06.945 --> 42:10.005
- It could be interesting and fun.
- I said no.

42:10.082 --> 42:11.777
He's a prick, a real prick!

42:11.850 --> 42:14.148
I don't give a darn
who he is or what he did

42:14.219 --> 42:15.584
or anything like that.

42:15.654 --> 42:19.181
I'm not gonna help you, Julian.
I'm not gonna do that.

42:19.258 --> 42:22.227
And if you bring it up again,
I'll... I'll leave.

42:26.265 --> 42:27.698
[Julian clears throat]

42:29.134 --> 42:30.499
- Fine.
- Fine.

42:30.569 --> 42:32.628
- Change the subject.
- Good. You do it.

42:34.706 --> 42:36.503
- Change it.
- You.

42:37.075 --> 42:38.508
- Fine.
- OK.

42:40.846 --> 42:44.612
When I was a kid,
I wanted to be a cheerleader.

42:47.152 --> 42:49.484
Really. A cheerleader.

42:49.555 --> 42:53.116
Yeah. I wanted to be thrown in the air
and march in the band.

42:55.160 --> 42:56.923
Seriously?

42:56.995 --> 42:58.724
Mm-hm.

42:59.298 --> 43:00.959
That's so funny.

43:01.033 --> 43:04.093
I've got a brother-in-law
who was a male cheerleader...

43:04.169 --> 43:06.569
Jesus Christ, Danny!
I'm fucking kidding!

43:06.638 --> 43:08.663
I don't want to
talk about cheerleaders

43:08.740 --> 43:11.300
unless I talk about getting in
a shower with them!

43:11.376 --> 43:14.743
I want to talk about what I wanted to,
which you don't want to!

43:14.813 --> 43:17.145
There's nothing
to talk about!

43:20.485 --> 43:22.680
Well, then,
it was nice knowing you.

43:22.754 --> 43:24.984
Oh, come...
Now, Julian...

43:25.057 --> 43:27.150
Come on, what are you...
You're leaving?

43:27.225 --> 43:29.250
I've got business to attend to.

43:29.328 --> 43:31.319
- I really thought...
- Nothing.

43:31.396 --> 43:35.992
Think nothing. Just consider me the best
cocktail party story you ever met.

43:37.169 --> 43:39.069
Bye, Danny.

43:42.441 --> 43:43.601
Julian!

43:52.517 --> 43:54.781
<i>[Phil] So unfortunately,</i>
<i>I was right.</i>

43:54.853 --> 43:57.014
<i>I finally got in touch with Alejandra</i>

43:57.089 --> 43:58.522
<i>and she said her bosses are</i>

43:58.590 --> 44:00.922
<i>leaning towards Cardenas</i>
<i>and his group,</i>

44:00.993 --> 44:02.426

44:02.494 --> 44:05.156
<i>Now, things still might</i>
<i>break in our favor.</i>

44:05.230 --> 44:07.664
<i>I mean, their first instinct</i>
<i>was to go with us,</i>

44:07.733 --> 44:09.758
<i>but they're getting intense pressure</i>

44:09.835 --> 44:11.928
<i>to sign with a Mexican company.</i>

44:12.004 --> 44:14.029
<i>I'm trying to get Antonio</i>
<i>so I can set up</i>

44:14.106 --> 44:16.336
<i>one more meeting</i>
<i>with you guys tomorrow.</i>

44:16.408 --> 44:18.342
<i>I'll call you</i>
<i>when I hear something.</i>

44:18.410 --> 44:21.208
<i>So hang in there.</i>
<i>It's not over yet.</i>

44:21.279 --> 44:24.271
- [hangs up]
<i>- [operator speaks Spanish]</i>

44:46.905 --> 44:49.203
- [knocking]
- [Julian] Danny.

44:50.308 --> 44:52.435
Danny, it's Julian.

44:52.511 --> 44:54.035
Come on, Danny,

44:54.112 --> 44:56.239
I just want to say I'm sorry.

44:56.314 --> 44:58.874
I know it's late,
and I'm a little fucked up.

44:58.950 --> 45:01.612
But... I'm sorry.

45:01.687 --> 45:05.885
I'm a mess! I'm a fucker! Ha!

45:10.028 --> 45:14.294
[sighs] Look, I shouldn't
have asked you to help me.

45:14.366 --> 45:17.460
I infringed...
I infringed on your kindness,

45:17.536 --> 45:18.560
but please...

45:18.804 --> 45:21.568
...let me tell you I'm sorry.

45:21.640 --> 45:23.835
Let me apologize.

45:23.909 --> 45:27.003
Can't you see
how guilty I feel?

45:28.513 --> 45:30.037
Danny!

45:30.115 --> 45:32.140
Danny!

45:32.217 --> 45:34.515
[glass breaking]

45:41.991 --> 45:44.789
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Oh, yes.

47:11.881 --> 47:13.542
Hello, Julian.

47:15.084 --> 47:17.609
Getting some culture?

47:18.621 --> 47:20.418
Anytime I can.

47:20.490 --> 47:22.048
You look tired.

47:22.825 --> 47:24.019
I am.

47:24.994 --> 47:28.191
- I need a break.
- What are you saying, Julian?

47:28.264 --> 47:31.165
Moscow, Las Vegas,
Vienna, the Philippines.

47:31.234 --> 47:33.532
Now Budapest. I'm exhausted.

47:33.603 --> 47:35.230
Well, you know what it's like.

47:35.304 --> 47:38.432
You take a break,
we go with a younger, cheaper kid.

47:38.508 --> 47:40.066
- Oh.
- He does all right.

47:40.143 --> 47:43.670
Maybe we don't want you back when
you're ready to get back in the game.

47:43.746 --> 47:45.213
You'll always want me.

47:45.281 --> 47:47.215
No, not always.

47:47.283 --> 47:49.877
Not if we can save a few dollars.

47:49.952 --> 47:53.217
Not if it gets sloppy again,
like in Manila.

47:53.289 --> 47:54.517
That was one time.

47:54.757 --> 47:56.384
Made some people nervous.

47:56.459 --> 47:57.721
It made me nervous.

47:57.794 --> 47:59.557
Well, that's why
I need a break.

47:59.629 --> 48:01.597
I don't want to have
that happen again.

48:01.664 --> 48:04.394
- It can't.
- I know, that's what I'm saying.

48:04.467 --> 48:07.402
But I'm feeling burnt-out,
I'm feeling...

48:07.470 --> 48:08.767
...shaky.

48:09.972 --> 48:11.735
Can you believe this shit?

48:11.808 --> 48:15.209
I mean, can you believe
the words coming out of my mouth?

48:15.278 --> 48:17.803
Did you ever think
you'd live to see the day?

48:17.880 --> 48:20.041
I never thought you'd
live to see the day.

48:20.116 --> 48:22.949
There's not a retirement home
for assassins, is there?

48:23.019 --> 48:25.283
Archery at four, riflery at five?

48:25.354 --> 48:27.515
A little early-bird dinner at six?

48:27.757 --> 48:30.453
Goddamn it, you leave the game,
even for a while,

48:30.526 --> 48:32.585
I don't know if they'll
let you back in.

48:32.662 --> 48:34.289
And then what
are you gonna do?

48:34.363 --> 48:36.627
Waste days picking up
illiterate teenagers

48:36.699 --> 48:39.930
for suck-and-fuck sessions
behind the Old Navy store?

48:40.002 --> 48:43.130
- Sounds delightful to me.
- Julian, do this job.

48:43.206 --> 48:46.175
If you don't, you're going to regret it,
I promise you.

48:46.242 --> 48:47.709
How do you know?

48:52.148 --> 48:55.879
Just do it, Julian.
Please, do it. OK?

51:22.665 --> 51:24.997
We have a problem, Mr. Randy.

51:25.067 --> 51:27.558
The problem is Julian Noble.

51:27.637 --> 51:30.697
Seems he didn't
deliver the portfolio.

51:32.108 --> 51:33.837
You know...

51:33.909 --> 51:37.401
...it says it took 53 years

51:37.480 --> 51:39.345
to paint this ceiling.

51:40.783 --> 51:43.980
People are upset, Mr. Randy.

51:44.053 --> 51:46.487
Mr. Stick is upset.

51:47.890 --> 51:49.289
Mr. Stick knows?

51:49.358 --> 51:51.223
Mr. Stick knows.

51:53.362 --> 51:55.762
Well, he knows we can fix it.

51:59.068 --> 52:01.036
I'm just the messenger.

52:01.103 --> 52:03.264
But he knows we can fix it.

52:03.339 --> 52:05.273
We always fix any problems.

52:05.341 --> 52:06.808
You can't fix it with Noble.

52:07.877 --> 52:09.105
Ladies.

52:10.579 --> 52:13.104
All right. I'll replace him.

52:13.182 --> 52:14.376
No.

52:14.450 --> 52:17.851
Yes, you'll replace him,

52:17.920 --> 52:19.387
but no.

52:19.455 --> 52:22.891
Mr. Stick has asked
for other things.

52:22.958 --> 52:24.949
No, it's ridiculous.

52:25.027 --> 52:27.723
Julian has been
with us for 22 years.

52:27.797 --> 52:29.196
Two little mistakes...

52:29.265 --> 52:32.359
Julian Noble... is a dead man.

52:40.910 --> 52:43.879
[Danny] Oh! Ohh! Oh, yeah!

52:43.946 --> 52:46.915
- Oh, that's it, Danny boy!
- Oh, yeah!

52:46.982 --> 52:49.644
Give it to me,
Danny boy!

52:49.719 --> 52:52.244
[both panting and grunting]

52:53.823 --> 52:56.383
Danny boy! Oh! Uh!

52:56.459 --> 52:58.222
[grunting]

53:04.800 --> 53:06.961
Oh! Excellent.

53:08.270 --> 53:09.999
- [buzzing]
- Oh!

53:10.072 --> 53:13.473
- Laundry's done.
- Oh!

53:15.111 --> 53:17.170
[wind blowing]

53:27.123 --> 53:29.785
Tomorrow's four years.

53:30.826 --> 53:32.088
I know.

53:35.097 --> 53:38.362
It's such a long time, really,
when you think about it.

53:40.669 --> 53:43.433
Seems like yesterday, right?

53:44.940 --> 53:47.067
Henry was alive...

53:48.878 --> 53:50.004
...here.

53:55.651 --> 53:59.178
When I was first in high school,
I told you they made fun of me.

53:59.255 --> 54:02.315
And they called me Hippo Hips

54:02.391 --> 54:05.588
and Plate of Beans, the works.

54:07.763 --> 54:10.288
And even though I did basketball

54:10.366 --> 54:12.596
and... and chorus and...

54:12.668 --> 54:16.536
And I had a few friends
and I acted strong...

54:16.605 --> 54:18.835
...I never was.

54:20.910 --> 54:24.368
Because I believed them always,
every last cruel word.

54:26.348 --> 54:27.815
And I...

54:27.883 --> 54:30.818
I always thought
I would believe them.

54:31.921 --> 54:34.116
Until I met you.

54:37.693 --> 54:40.321
You arrived in 12th grade...

54:42.364 --> 54:45.731
...and you told me
that I was pretty.

54:45.801 --> 54:48.702
And for the first time,
I believed it.

54:48.771 --> 54:51.672
You told me that I was sexy.

54:51.740 --> 54:55.335
You were sexy back there
on the dryer.

54:56.478 --> 54:59.470
And when Henry died...

54:59.548 --> 55:03.507
[crying]... you told me
to stay strong...

55:03.586 --> 55:06.612
...and that we would
get through it.

55:07.857 --> 55:10.018
And we did.

55:11.460 --> 55:13.690
We did.

55:21.337 --> 55:23.430
It's because you
never gave up on me.

55:23.505 --> 55:25.700
I never could.

55:27.142 --> 55:29.235
I never will.

55:37.753 --> 55:39.721
[doorbell ringing]

55:40.956 --> 55:43.618
Who could that be
at 11:30 at night?

55:45.527 --> 55:47.995
[doorbell continues ringing]

55:48.063 --> 55:50.327
[knocking on door]

55:50.399 --> 55:51.798
Yeah?

55:52.601 --> 55:53.966
[Julian] Danny Wright?

55:54.737 --> 55:56.898
Yes. Who's there?

55:56.972 --> 56:00.032
Danny, Danny!

56:00.109 --> 56:02.703
Danny with the large white fanny!

56:04.546 --> 56:07.640
- Julian!
- Would you mind opening up, Danny?

56:07.716 --> 56:10.742
It's freezing out here!
My balls are like bonbons!

56:12.588 --> 56:15.148
[laughing]

56:15.224 --> 56:18.057
I was praying
you'd remember me.

56:18.127 --> 56:19.458
It's been a spell.

56:19.528 --> 56:20.927
[chuckles]

56:20.996 --> 56:22.588
Please, please, come on...

56:22.665 --> 56:24.565
- Come on in.
- Thank you, thank you.

56:26.201 --> 56:28.066
[laughs]

56:28.137 --> 56:30.071
Oooh!

56:31.407 --> 56:32.806
Hey.

56:32.875 --> 56:35.173
Oh, I decided to...

56:35.244 --> 56:37.007
How did you find me?

56:37.079 --> 56:39.206
I found a whore
with a heart of gold once.

56:39.281 --> 56:42.182
I can find Danny Wright's card
in my address book.

56:42.251 --> 56:43.582
[giggles]

56:43.652 --> 56:44.880
Oh.

56:44.954 --> 56:47.218
Oh, excuse me.
I didn't realize. Sorry.

56:47.289 --> 56:48.756
It's OK.

56:50.392 --> 56:51.825
You must be Bean.

56:52.795 --> 56:54.888
- My wife.
- Oh, this...

56:54.964 --> 56:57.933
- Um...
- Oh, my...

56:58.000 --> 56:59.297
My boots.

57:01.971 --> 57:03.563
I've heard so much about you.

57:03.639 --> 57:05.937
And me, you.

57:06.008 --> 57:07.873
Oh...

57:10.546 --> 57:15.006
There's no doubt you're every bit
as lovely as Danny said.

57:15.084 --> 57:16.813
[chuckling] Danny...

57:17.720 --> 57:20.655
I always said you were
the luckiest man I ever met.

57:22.758 --> 57:24.589
Well...

57:28.964 --> 57:31.797
What are you doing here, Julian?

57:41.010 --> 57:43.376
I really don't know.

57:44.580 --> 57:45.808
I don't know.

57:47.583 --> 57:50.518
I hope it's all right, my being here.
I mean...

57:50.753 --> 57:53.278
I guess it's the middle
of the night. [chuckling]

57:53.355 --> 57:55.482
- Yes, it's...
- Well...

57:55.557 --> 57:58.287
I could sure use some coffee.

57:58.360 --> 58:00.419
Just a cup.

58:00.496 --> 58:02.396
Yes. All right.

58:02.464 --> 58:04.056
Of course.
I could get coffee.

58:04.133 --> 58:05.896
That'd be great.

58:05.968 --> 58:07.731
- Or some whiskey?
- Even better.

58:07.803 --> 58:10.829
- Mm.
- Tonight's a night for whiskey, then.

58:10.906 --> 58:12.430
And song and dance.

58:13.776 --> 58:16.301
Well, whiskey, at least.

58:19.214 --> 58:21.842
This is really odd.

58:21.917 --> 58:23.885
Really, really odd.

58:23.952 --> 58:25.852
I could ask him to leave.

58:25.921 --> 58:27.980
We just asked him to stay.

58:28.057 --> 58:30.082
We could change our minds.

58:30.159 --> 58:32.923
Why? Do you think he's dangerous?

58:33.996 --> 58:37.056
He's an assassin, Bean.
Of course he's dangerous.

58:37.132 --> 58:39.362
But I mean "dangerous" dangerous.

58:39.435 --> 58:41.232
You said he was a nice guy.

58:41.303 --> 58:44.898
He is. For an assassin,
he's... very nice.

58:46.008 --> 58:47.498
Fuck.

58:47.576 --> 58:49.134
Fuckity-fuck!

58:50.345 --> 58:52.506
What? I'm allowed to curse.

58:52.581 --> 58:55.379
Especially now.
If not now, when?

58:55.451 --> 58:57.180
True.

58:57.252 --> 58:59.015
This is the fucking perfect time

58:59.088 --> 59:00.817
to be fucking cursing.

59:00.889 --> 59:02.516
There's a fucking killer

59:02.758 --> 59:05.556
standing in our
fucking living room.

59:08.597 --> 59:11.532
Do you think he
would show me his gun?

59:18.006 --> 59:20.031
[Bean] A toast, maybe?

59:20.109 --> 59:21.804
To a stranger,

59:21.877 --> 59:24.243
arriving in
the middle of the night.

59:24.313 --> 59:25.871
Well, you're not a stranger.

59:25.948 --> 59:27.813
Well, I'm pretty strange.

59:27.883 --> 59:30.818
Be that as it may,
you're not a stranger, Julian.

59:30.886 --> 59:32.353
Far from it.

59:32.421 --> 59:35.584
The toast really
should be to you, Danny.

59:35.657 --> 59:37.147
And to you, Bean.

59:37.226 --> 59:40.127
For your hospitality
and your warmth.

59:47.202 --> 59:48.965
- Oh.
- [coughs]

59:49.037 --> 59:50.971
Hmm! [chuckling]

59:51.039 --> 59:53.473
I never thought
I'd see you again, Julian.

59:53.542 --> 59:55.703
I never thought
I'd see you again, Danny.

59:55.777 --> 59:56.971
But, well...

59:57.045 --> 59:58.512
...things, uh...

59:58.747 --> 01:00:02.478
Things change.
They just change.

01:00:02.551 --> 01:00:04.416
[Julian] Is that?

01:00:06.622 --> 01:00:09.750
- You saved it.
- I did.

01:00:09.825 --> 01:00:11.816
You saved it.
I can't believe it.

01:00:11.894 --> 01:00:15.330
- [Bean] He still talks about that.
- No, it's...

01:00:15.397 --> 01:00:17.456
It touches me
that you kept it.

01:00:17.533 --> 01:00:18.830
How could I not?

01:00:18.901 --> 01:00:21.495
- That was a special day.
- Yes.

01:00:21.570 --> 01:00:24.232
So Danny told you what I did?

01:00:24.306 --> 01:00:26.467
Professionally?

01:00:27.776 --> 01:00:30.939
Did you bring your gun?

01:00:31.013 --> 01:00:34.312
Yes... as a matter of fact.

01:00:34.383 --> 01:00:36.317
May I see it?

01:00:36.385 --> 01:00:37.977
Really?

01:00:38.053 --> 01:00:40.248
- Yes, please.
- Honey, he's not just...

01:00:40.322 --> 01:00:41.653
- Here you go.
- OK.

01:00:49.731 --> 01:00:51.528
Is that a.38?

01:00:51.767 --> 01:00:53.325
Yes, it is.

01:00:53.402 --> 01:00:55.836
You know your guns, Bean.

01:00:55.904 --> 01:00:58.270
Yes, well...

01:00:58.340 --> 01:01:00.001
My God.

01:01:00.075 --> 01:01:02.976
You are a magnificent woman.

01:01:03.045 --> 01:01:04.410
Hm.

01:01:04.479 --> 01:01:07.744
Bean knows a lot of things
about a lot of things.

01:01:07.816 --> 01:01:09.477
Bean, tell me,

01:01:09.551 --> 01:01:11.519
did Danny tell you everything

01:01:11.587 --> 01:01:13.817
about our time
in Mexico together?

01:01:13.889 --> 01:01:15.948
Yes, I'm sure. Why?

01:01:17.192 --> 01:01:18.557
Oh.

01:01:21.330 --> 01:01:24.163
My God, you look great, Danny.

01:01:24.233 --> 01:01:25.894
[laughing] Really great.

01:01:25.968 --> 01:01:28.436
- You do too, Julian.
- Oh, no.

01:01:28.503 --> 01:01:31.267
I look like a Bangkok hooker
on a Sunday morning

01:01:31.340 --> 01:01:33.365
after the Navy left town.

01:01:33.442 --> 01:01:34.568
But you...

01:01:34.810 --> 01:01:37.005
Life's been good to you,
am I right?

01:01:37.079 --> 01:01:38.637
Pretty good, yeah.

01:01:38.714 --> 01:01:42.172
Your work? You have that respect
you wanted back again?

01:01:42.251 --> 01:01:43.878
I do.

01:01:43.952 --> 01:01:46.216
So you got that job
you were in Mexico for?

01:01:46.288 --> 01:01:47.550
We did.

01:01:47.623 --> 01:01:49.591
And your luck?
It's better, right?

01:01:49.658 --> 01:01:51.717
No more trees in the kitchen?

01:01:52.928 --> 01:01:55.396
You told him about that?

01:01:55.464 --> 01:01:57.762
And you love Bean
more than ever.

01:01:57.833 --> 01:02:00.358
Mm. That I do.

01:02:00.435 --> 01:02:03.233
Then what more could you want?

01:02:03.305 --> 01:02:04.533
Here's a toast.

01:02:04.773 --> 01:02:08.174
To a man with respect again,

01:02:08.243 --> 01:02:11.872
to a woman who's more lovely
than any man deserves

01:02:11.947 --> 01:02:13.744
and to me.

01:02:13.815 --> 01:02:16.943
What is the toast to you for?

01:02:17.019 --> 01:02:19.317
Toast to a dead man, Bean.

01:02:20.389 --> 01:02:22.789
Toast to a dead man.

01:02:25.160 --> 01:02:28.561
[Julian] Then about two months ago
I had this job in Manila.

01:02:28.630 --> 01:02:31.155
Now, normally,
this would make me happy.

01:02:31.233 --> 01:02:32.632
I like the hot climate.

01:02:32.701 --> 01:02:35.329
The guys look like chicks.
It's fucking fantastic.

01:02:35.404 --> 01:02:38.567
The thing was,
I was burnt-out.

01:02:38.640 --> 01:02:42.132
I didn't know it, didn't even know
what "burnt-out" meant at the time.

01:02:42.210 --> 01:02:46.203
But I was.
I was a classic textbook case.

01:02:53.121 --> 01:02:55.055
<i>[Julian] I was having panic attacks.</i>

01:02:55.123 --> 01:02:57.318
<i>I was completely</i>
<i>losing control of myself.</i>

01:02:57.392 --> 01:02:59.792
<i>I tried to counter this</i>
<i>with booze, of course,</i>

01:02:59.861 --> 01:03:01.761
<i>but nothing was working.</i>

01:03:01.830 --> 01:03:04.993
<i>I drank and drank and...</i>

01:03:05.067 --> 01:03:06.591
<i>...nothing.</i>

01:03:06.668 --> 01:03:08.158
<i>I was still feeling edgy,</i>

01:03:08.236 --> 01:03:11.171
<i>still feeling like</i>
<i>my head was going to explode.</i>

01:03:11.239 --> 01:03:12.831
<i>So...</i>

01:03:12.908 --> 01:03:15.809
<i>...I moved on</i>
<i>to my other usual diversions.</i>

01:03:15.877 --> 01:03:17.868
<i>A wonderful little</i>
<i>whorehouse I knew</i>

01:03:17.946 --> 01:03:21.211
<i>right off of Mabini Street.</i>

01:03:21.283 --> 01:03:23.979
<i>But that wasn't workin' either.</i>

01:03:24.052 --> 01:03:26.145
<i>And a good fuck usually does.</i>

01:03:26.221 --> 01:03:27.688
Excuse my French.

01:03:28.523 --> 01:03:30.491
- Go on.
- So I had this assignment.

01:03:30.559 --> 01:03:33.255
Nothing special,
some copper wire executive,

01:03:33.328 --> 01:03:35.057
someone doesn't
want him around.

01:03:35.130 --> 01:03:37.462
You know,
my usual type gig.

01:03:37.532 --> 01:03:39.591
Well, I knew that this copper wire guy

01:03:39.668 --> 01:03:43.399
<i>always came to this sweaty little</i>
<i>outdoor market every Thursday</i>

01:03:43.472 --> 01:03:44.769
<i>to buy fruit.</i>

01:03:45.774 --> 01:03:47.935
<i>The guy liked his fruit.</i>

01:03:50.645 --> 01:03:52.010
[monkeys chattering]

01:03:55.684 --> 01:03:57.379
<i>It was a simple plan.</i>

01:03:57.452 --> 01:04:00.478
<i>As he walks through the crowds</i>
<i>I bump into him</i>

01:04:00.555 --> 01:04:02.750
<i>and stab him.</i>

01:04:12.634 --> 01:04:15.330
<i>The thing was,</i>
<i>I was still a mess.</i>

01:04:17.939 --> 01:04:20.703
<i>And every time I looked at the guy,</i>
<i>I didn't see him,</i>

01:04:20.776 --> 01:04:23.802
<i>but I saw a little boy instead!</i>

01:04:31.953 --> 01:04:34.319
<i>And it wasn't just any boy.</i>

01:04:35.490 --> 01:04:36.889
<i>It was me.</i>

01:04:36.958 --> 01:04:39.051
Me, as a child!

01:04:42.197 --> 01:04:44.097
It was freaky shit, right?

01:04:46.201 --> 01:04:49.932
<i>Real nervous breakdown sort of stuff.</i>

01:04:55.811 --> 01:04:59.212
<i>Still readied the knife,</i>
<i>still prepared for the job.</i>

01:04:59.281 --> 01:05:00.771
<i>But...</i>

01:05:04.553 --> 01:05:06.817
<i>...I couldn't do it.</i>

01:05:06.888 --> 01:05:09.356
<i>I just couldn't do it.</i>

01:05:20.735 --> 01:05:21.929
Then what happened?

01:05:22.003 --> 01:05:24.665
I woke up in a pile
of donkey shit.

01:05:25.407 --> 01:05:26.635
<i>I fainted.</i>

01:05:27.442 --> 01:05:30.468
And I guess I landed
in a pile of donkey shit.

01:05:30.545 --> 01:05:32.911
[donkeys braying]

01:05:34.983 --> 01:05:36.450
<i>And since then,</i>

01:05:36.518 --> 01:05:38.952
it's been extremely
hot and cold.

01:05:39.020 --> 01:05:43.354
Some jobs go OK,
others not so OK.

01:05:45.427 --> 01:05:48.487
And then a few weeks ago
I fucked up again. In Budapest.

01:05:48.730 --> 01:05:50.459
Froze.

01:05:50.532 --> 01:05:53.228
Right at the moment
I should have been firing.

01:05:53.301 --> 01:05:56.031
[sighs] Couldn't finish the job.

01:05:56.104 --> 01:05:57.833
And that was that.

01:05:58.640 --> 01:06:00.505
And now it's just a matter of time.

01:06:01.843 --> 01:06:05.210
Well, isn't there somebody
that you can talk to?

01:06:05.280 --> 01:06:07.874
Like Mary Beth
in Human Resources?

01:06:07.949 --> 01:06:10.349
Come on, this is...
this is insane.

01:06:10.418 --> 01:06:12.613
They're gonna kill you
for botching a job?

01:06:12.687 --> 01:06:13.881
Mm-hm.

01:06:13.955 --> 01:06:16.651
Well, can't you just,
you know, say to them,

01:06:16.725 --> 01:06:19.319
you know, "You know what? I'm sorry.

01:06:19.394 --> 01:06:21.225
You know,
I was a little burned out,

01:06:21.296 --> 01:06:22.854
and I'm a little messed up."

01:06:22.931 --> 01:06:26.298
I mean, can't you do that?
But...

01:06:26.368 --> 01:06:30.304
I mean, you were seeing images
of yourself as a small boy.

01:06:30.372 --> 01:06:33.307
If that's not a Freudian meltdown,
I don't know what is.

01:06:33.375 --> 01:06:35.343
But certainly,
they have to see that.

01:06:35.410 --> 01:06:37.674
No, they don't.
They don't.

01:06:37.746 --> 01:06:39.304
I mean, I...

01:06:39.381 --> 01:06:41.781
I'd be dead if my handler
hadn't risked his life

01:06:41.850 --> 01:06:43.579
and tipped me off to the plans.

01:06:43.652 --> 01:06:46.712
I barely got out of Budapest alive.

01:06:46.788 --> 01:06:48.847
And how did you end up here?

01:06:48.924 --> 01:06:50.585
In Denver?

01:06:50.659 --> 01:06:51.921
Hm.

01:06:53.895 --> 01:06:55.487
That's funny.

01:06:56.932 --> 01:07:00.595
Some people run home
in a time of crisis.

01:07:01.670 --> 01:07:03.365
My problem,

01:07:03.438 --> 01:07:06.100
the problem I shared
with Danny in Mexico,

01:07:06.174 --> 01:07:08.540
is that I don't have a home.

01:07:08.610 --> 01:07:11.204
I mean...

01:07:11.279 --> 01:07:13.645
...that's why I'm here.

01:07:15.150 --> 01:07:16.845
You're the only friend I have.

01:07:18.119 --> 01:07:20.485
Oh, well, that's...
that's ridiculous.

01:07:20.555 --> 01:07:22.750
I... You have... you have friends.

01:07:25.860 --> 01:07:27.555
I don't.

01:07:27.629 --> 01:07:30.029
I really don't.

01:07:30.098 --> 01:07:32.328
You all right?

01:07:32.400 --> 01:07:35.369
[laughing] It's fucking crazy, right?

01:07:36.237 --> 01:07:38.705
You're my only friend,
and I barely know you.

01:07:38.773 --> 01:07:40.035
[chuckles]

01:07:40.108 --> 01:07:42.599
This home...

01:07:45.146 --> 01:07:46.875
...your home...

01:07:46.948 --> 01:07:48.711
[sighs]

01:07:48.783 --> 01:07:51.217
...it's the only home I know.

01:07:53.989 --> 01:07:57.322
[Julian] God, she's really
fantastic, Danny.

01:07:57.392 --> 01:07:59.622
She's lovely.

01:07:59.694 --> 01:08:01.787
[Danny] She's everything to me.

01:08:01.863 --> 01:08:04.559
You said that to me in Mexico.

01:08:04.633 --> 01:08:07.363
And I nodded and listened...

01:08:07.869 --> 01:08:10.133
...but now I see.

01:08:11.306 --> 01:08:12.773
I see.

01:08:14.242 --> 01:08:16.107
You were right.

01:08:20.515 --> 01:08:23.541
You told her everything
that happened in Mexico?

01:08:25.654 --> 01:08:28.747
I told her about
our time together, yes.

01:08:31.359 --> 01:08:34.020
And where does that story end?

01:08:37.165 --> 01:08:39.189
She knows the last I heard of you

01:08:39.267 --> 01:08:41.997
you were knocking on my room
in the middle of the night

01:08:42.069 --> 01:08:45.163
asking forgiveness for trying
to involve me in a job.

01:08:47.142 --> 01:08:49.508
That's what you said?

01:08:49.743 --> 01:08:52.337
That I knocked and knocked.

01:08:52.413 --> 01:08:54.541
And you never answered?

01:08:56.417 --> 01:08:57.817
Yes.

01:08:59.621 --> 01:09:00.609
[Bean] Gentlemen.

01:09:03.191 --> 01:09:05.682
- I'm a bit drunk.
- [Julian chuckles]

01:09:05.760 --> 01:09:08.024
That's a nice place to be.

01:09:08.095 --> 01:09:11.064
Julian, you will stay
the night, of course?

01:09:11.131 --> 01:09:13.191
Oh, thank you, Bean.

01:09:13.268 --> 01:09:15.497
I promise I'll be
out of here tomorrow.

01:09:15.569 --> 01:09:17.504
Oh, let's not talk about that now.

01:09:17.738 --> 01:09:20.173
You know, I don't think
I've been up with a guest

01:09:20.241 --> 01:09:23.233
till 2:30 in the morning
in a long time.

01:09:23.310 --> 01:09:24.368
It's good, right?

01:09:24.446 --> 01:09:26.913
- Oh, it's very good.
- Hey...

01:09:26.981 --> 01:09:28.881
Can I turn on your stereo?

01:09:28.950 --> 01:09:31.850
- Sure. Now?
- Yeah, I saw this old record of yours,

01:09:31.920 --> 01:09:36.050
and I just wanted to hear In the Wee
Small Hours of the Morning. You know?

01:09:36.124 --> 01:09:38.786
Since we're in the wee small hours
of the morning?

01:09:38.859 --> 01:09:40.292
Is that OK?

01:09:40.361 --> 01:09:41.885
Certainly. I guess.

01:09:46.201 --> 01:09:49.102
[# Dave Van Norden:
In the Wee Small Hours of the Morning]

01:09:57.178 --> 01:09:59.043
[Julian] Danny.

01:09:59.114 --> 01:10:01.776
I hope you approve, but...

01:10:01.850 --> 01:10:04.717
...I would really like
to ask your wife to dance.

01:10:08.123 --> 01:10:10.990
Julian, you have had
too much to drink.

01:10:13.261 --> 01:10:14.592
Bean.

01:10:14.662 --> 01:10:16.721
Please, may I have this dance?

01:10:16.798 --> 01:10:21.531
# <i>In the wee small hours</i>

01:10:21.603 --> 01:10:24.538
# <i>Of the morning</i>

01:10:24.606 --> 01:10:28.804
# <i>While the whole wide world</i>

01:10:28.877 --> 01:10:31.573
# <i>Is fast asleep</i>

01:10:33.815 --> 01:10:37.876
# <i>You lie awake</i>

01:10:37.952 --> 01:10:41.752
# <i>And think about the girl</i>

01:10:41.823 --> 01:10:44.758
# <i>And never, ever think</i>

01:10:44.826 --> 01:10:49.388
# <i>Of counting sheep</i>

01:10:51.032 --> 01:10:55.298
# <i>When your lonely heart</i>

01:10:55.370 --> 01:10:58.362
# <i>Has learned its lesson</i>

01:10:59.674 --> 01:11:02.234
# <i>You'd be hers</i>

01:11:02.310 --> 01:11:06.440
# <i>If only she would call</i>

01:11:08.416 --> 01:11:12.580
# <i>In the wee small hours</i>

01:11:12.821 --> 01:11:16.587
# <i>Of the morning</i>

01:11:16.658 --> 01:11:21.027
- # <i>That's the time...</i>
- Bravo! Bravo!

01:11:21.095 --> 01:11:23.529
- [laughing]
- [pounding]

01:11:23.598 --> 01:11:26.965
I learned to dance in a South American
jail by a chap named Morales.

01:11:27.035 --> 01:11:29.265
Well, that's another story,
another time.

01:11:29.337 --> 01:11:31.635
The final nightcap.

01:11:31.706 --> 01:11:34.334
I can't think about the headache
I'm gonna have.

01:11:34.409 --> 01:11:37.071
Then don't. Or do.
Take three aspirins and a raw egg

01:11:37.145 --> 01:11:38.669
before you go to bed.

01:11:38.746 --> 01:11:42.341
Where'd you hear that one?
The Assassin's Book of Home Remedies?

01:11:42.417 --> 01:11:45.511
[both laughing]

01:11:47.055 --> 01:11:49.216
The only woman I ever loved.

01:11:49.290 --> 01:11:51.451
My mother.

01:11:51.526 --> 01:11:54.518
- What about your wife?
- Hm?

01:11:54.596 --> 01:11:57.793
- My wife?
- Danny told me that you were married

01:11:57.866 --> 01:12:00.858
and that she died in a car accident.
You loved her.

01:12:01.970 --> 01:12:03.130
Um...

01:12:14.048 --> 01:12:15.675
Oh, my God!

01:12:15.750 --> 01:12:17.377
I can't believe this!

01:12:17.452 --> 01:12:19.317
I was never married.

01:12:19.387 --> 01:12:21.821
- I can't believe this!
- No car accident?

01:12:21.890 --> 01:12:25.382
No. I'd been insensitive
to Danny about your son

01:12:25.460 --> 01:12:27.826
and was trying to win him over.
It was stupid.

01:12:27.896 --> 01:12:30.194
You know what,
I'm the one that was stupid.

01:12:30.265 --> 01:12:31.289
No, no, no, no, no!

01:12:31.366 --> 01:12:34.858
You're not stupid.
I'm a prick! Me, not you!

01:12:34.936 --> 01:12:37.336
The thing is, I could have
kept lying to you now,

01:12:37.405 --> 01:12:39.635
but I chose not to,
as a sign of respect.

01:12:39.707 --> 01:12:42.403
Because... well, now we're friends.

01:12:42.477 --> 01:12:43.705
Oh.

01:12:45.179 --> 01:12:46.578
We are friends, aren't we?

01:12:46.648 --> 01:12:49.242
So, what other bullshit
did you pour over me?

01:12:49.317 --> 01:12:51.410
Yeah, are you even
a hit man, Julian?

01:12:51.486 --> 01:12:55.889
Yeah, a facility fatalitator,
whatever the fuck you call yourself.

01:12:55.957 --> 01:12:57.288
Yes, I am.

01:12:57.358 --> 01:13:00.759
And to answer your question,
Danny, I lie when I need to,

01:13:00.828 --> 01:13:02.557
tell the truth when I can.

01:13:02.630 --> 01:13:03.995
With you...

01:13:05.033 --> 01:13:07.467
...it's mostly been the truth.

01:13:15.977 --> 01:13:18.275
[clears throat]
Shall I go?

01:13:23.284 --> 01:13:24.546
No.

01:13:24.786 --> 01:13:26.083
No.

01:13:28.289 --> 01:13:30.052
No...

01:13:31.125 --> 01:13:32.786
[laughing]

01:13:32.860 --> 01:13:35.693
Aren't we fucking cosmopolitan?

01:13:36.798 --> 01:13:40.359
Having a trained assassin
stay over the night.

01:13:40.435 --> 01:13:41.902
Letting heartbreaking lies

01:13:41.970 --> 01:13:45.428
just roll over us
like the summer breeze.

01:13:45.506 --> 01:13:47.406
Next we shall be
wife swapping. Ha!

01:13:49.978 --> 01:13:52.071
You don't have a wife.

01:13:52.146 --> 01:13:53.272
Remember?

01:13:55.016 --> 01:13:57.143
[both laugh]

01:13:57.218 --> 01:13:59.846
[laughs]

01:14:00.755 --> 01:14:02.279
That's a good point.

01:14:08.596 --> 01:14:10.689
[breathing]

01:14:11.766 --> 01:14:13.393
[door opens]

01:14:18.573 --> 01:14:20.006
[whispers] Danny.

01:14:21.109 --> 01:14:22.474
Danny.

01:14:28.616 --> 01:14:31.813
- Danny.
- No. I don't like chicken.

01:14:31.886 --> 01:14:34.821
Come on.
I've gotta talk to you.

01:14:38.259 --> 01:14:40.420
What is it, Julian?
What do you want?

01:14:40.495 --> 01:14:42.429
We can't talk about it here.

01:14:42.497 --> 01:14:44.192
- What?
- Come on.

01:14:47.535 --> 01:14:51.062
[Danny] OK, Julian,
we're in your rent-a-car.

01:14:51.139 --> 01:14:53.903
- What is it?
- The thing is, Danny...

01:14:53.975 --> 01:14:55.909
...the thing I didn't tell you,

01:14:55.977 --> 01:14:59.504
the thing that I omitted
because Bean was present,

01:14:59.580 --> 01:15:03.107
was that I've been offered a way
out of my fatal predicament.

01:15:05.019 --> 01:15:07.249
- Well, that's good.
- I know, I know.

01:15:07.321 --> 01:15:09.585
No, that's really good.
What is it?

01:15:09.657 --> 01:15:13.388
My handler, Mr. Randy,
contacted me like he always does

01:15:13.461 --> 01:15:17.227
with an ad in the International Tribune
looking for cat-sitters in Bali.

01:15:17.298 --> 01:15:20.495
Is that how you stay in contact?
Cat-sitter ads?

01:15:20.568 --> 01:15:22.331
Yeah.

01:15:22.403 --> 01:15:24.200
OK, you know,
this is ridiculous.

01:15:24.272 --> 01:15:26.502
- I'm so tired, Julian.
- Well, anyway,

01:15:26.574 --> 01:15:28.508
he contacted me four days ago

01:15:28.576 --> 01:15:31.067
and basically said
he'd been to the higher-ups

01:15:31.145 --> 01:15:33.079
and got me a reprieve.

01:15:33.147 --> 01:15:36.310
Well, like I said, that's...
that's... great news.

01:15:36.384 --> 01:15:38.614
The thing is...

01:15:38.686 --> 01:15:41.052
...he's asked me
to do one more job.

01:15:41.122 --> 01:15:43.249
I have no choice.
It's do the job or else.

01:15:43.324 --> 01:15:44.518
Right.

01:15:44.592 --> 01:15:48.028
And that brings us
to the dirty little problem.

01:15:49.764 --> 01:15:51.288
All right.

01:15:52.567 --> 01:15:53.795
What's the problem?

01:15:53.868 --> 01:15:57.463
It's a pretty big problem,
and you're really not gonna like it.

01:15:57.538 --> 01:15:59.904
- I'm not gonna like it?
- Not at all.

01:15:59.974 --> 01:16:02.442
Because the job...

01:16:04.312 --> 01:16:05.574
...involves you.

01:16:09.550 --> 01:16:11.882
You're not saying
what I think you're saying.

01:16:11.953 --> 01:16:14.217
What do you think I'm saying?

01:16:14.288 --> 01:16:17.223
You know what
I think you're saying.

01:16:17.291 --> 01:16:21.125
No. I don't think I know
what you think I'm saying.

01:16:22.964 --> 01:16:25.899
Does somebody want me dead?

01:16:35.309 --> 01:16:37.539
- No.
- What's that?

01:16:37.612 --> 01:16:39.239
No one wants you dead, Danny.

01:16:39.313 --> 01:16:43.909
- Jesus!
- [whimpering] You scared me!

01:16:43.985 --> 01:16:46.078
No. No...

01:16:46.154 --> 01:16:48.349
You were doing that...

01:16:48.422 --> 01:16:51.152
But I need your help
in facilitating a fatality.

01:16:51.225 --> 01:16:52.590
- What?
- I need your help.

01:16:52.660 --> 01:16:55.595
No, no, no.
My help is exactly what you don't need.

01:16:55.663 --> 01:16:57.460
I'm a mess, Danny, you know that.

01:16:57.532 --> 01:16:58.760
I'm a complete mess.

01:16:58.833 --> 01:17:00.960
I don't know
if I can do this job by myself.

01:17:01.035 --> 01:17:03.333
You gotta talk
to somebody else, a colleague.

01:17:03.404 --> 01:17:05.304
- I don't know colleagues.
- You must!

01:17:05.373 --> 01:17:07.637
- I don't.
- Well, I can't help you.

01:17:07.708 --> 01:17:10.006
I know you're not
the ideal candidate...

01:17:10.077 --> 01:17:13.672
No. I'm far, far from ideal, Julian.

01:17:13.748 --> 01:17:17.479
Remember my reaction the last time
you proposed something this asinine?

01:17:17.552 --> 01:17:20.385
That was Mexico.
I was trying to show you a good time!

01:17:20.454 --> 01:17:22.888
Oh, so now killing somebody
is a good time?

01:17:22.957 --> 01:17:24.447
Can be.

01:17:24.525 --> 01:17:26.959
- Oh... I'm going to sleep.
- Danny, come on.

01:17:27.028 --> 01:17:29.258
You don't even need
a second person.

01:17:29.330 --> 01:17:31.423
Haven't you done these things yourself?

01:17:31.499 --> 01:17:33.467
Some jobs are better
with two men.

01:17:33.534 --> 01:17:36.970
I think it's better
if the second man isn't scared shitless,

01:17:37.038 --> 01:17:38.437
and... and unprepared.

01:17:38.506 --> 01:17:41.031
And unqualified and uninterested!

01:17:41.108 --> 01:17:42.473
Now I'm gonna go to bed.

01:17:42.543 --> 01:17:44.841
I'm in a very dangerous position here.

01:17:44.912 --> 01:17:46.937
I'm in no shape to try this myself.

01:17:47.014 --> 01:17:49.983
An assassin without confidence
is a horrible thing.

01:17:50.051 --> 01:17:53.020
It's like a relief pitcher
who fumbles the ball.

01:17:54.288 --> 01:17:57.018
Tell me you know you mixed
two sports in your metaphor.

01:17:57.091 --> 01:17:59.082
Huh? I can't do that.

01:17:59.160 --> 01:18:00.650
Yeah.

01:18:02.163 --> 01:18:03.824
Danny! Danny, please!

01:18:03.898 --> 01:18:05.388
I need your help!

01:18:05.466 --> 01:18:07.593
Someone's gonna die,
a stranger or me.

01:18:07.668 --> 01:18:10.296
Which would you rather? Hm?

01:18:10.371 --> 01:18:12.339
Look,

01:18:12.406 --> 01:18:15.102
if I can do the job successfully,
I'm free and clear.

01:18:15.176 --> 01:18:16.575
Free and clear, Danny!

01:18:16.644 --> 01:18:19.545
I have enough money to retire
to a beautiful Greek island

01:18:19.614 --> 01:18:20.876
with beautiful Greeks.

01:18:20.948 --> 01:18:23.542
Heaven awaits me, Danny,
if you and I do this job.

01:18:23.618 --> 01:18:25.950
- I can't.
- Oh, damn it, Danny!

01:18:26.020 --> 01:18:28.079
You're my only friend!

01:18:28.155 --> 01:18:29.850
- Oh, Julian.
- It's true!

01:18:29.924 --> 01:18:31.186
And...

01:18:31.259 --> 01:18:33.523
- Oh...
- And what?

01:18:33.594 --> 01:18:36.085
And...

01:18:36.163 --> 01:18:37.357
[sighs]

01:18:37.431 --> 01:18:39.991
You owe me.

01:18:43.437 --> 01:18:46.463
If this were to happen,
when would it take place?

01:18:46.540 --> 01:18:48.974
Today. The horse races.

01:18:50.444 --> 01:18:52.412
- Today?
- Yeah, Arizona.

01:18:52.480 --> 01:18:53.970
No, that couldn't happen.

01:18:54.048 --> 01:18:55.515
Sorry, no choice.

01:18:56.684 --> 01:18:59.915
Today is the four-year anniversary
of my son Henry's death.

01:18:59.987 --> 01:19:02.319
We go to the cemetery.
That's what we do.

01:19:02.390 --> 01:19:05.120
What time does
the cemetery close, Danny?

01:19:05.192 --> 01:19:06.921
Well, I-I don't know.

01:19:06.994 --> 01:19:09.986
We'll have you back at 4:30,
flowers in hand. I promise.

01:19:10.064 --> 01:19:12.259
Oh. Oh.
You'll do that? OK.

01:19:12.333 --> 01:19:13.925
How will you do that, Julian?

01:19:14.001 --> 01:19:17.528
Well, we have a 7:40 plane reservation
to Tucson this morning.

01:19:17.605 --> 01:19:19.505
