01:06.057 --> 01:08.027
CHINA, 665AD

01:08.061 --> 01:10.031
The mighty Tang Dynasty...

01:10.099 --> 01:12.069
The motherland whose security is my deepest concern

01:13.138 --> 01:15.074
Luoyang...

01:15.075 --> 01:17.137
My soul, my dreams are rooted here

01:20.053 --> 01:22.023
In the year when I turned thirty...

01:22.024 --> 01:24.256
I left my hometown and travelled more than 1,000 li to Luoyang

01:26.065 --> 01:27.226
At that time, the court...

01:27.267 --> 01:30.137
... was ruled by the emperor under the supervision of Empress Wu

01:30.240 --> 01:32.210
They were know as "The Two Saints"

01:33.314 --> 01:35.284
Empress Wu completely controlled the emperor

01:36.153 --> 01:38.123
The nobles considered her power an affront

01:38.157 --> 01:40.127
They often admonished the emperor

01:41.196 --> 01:42.255
Then...

01:42.265 --> 01:44.167
... when the Fuyu Kingdom challenged our border...

01:44.202 --> 01:46.138
... as a precaution, Empress Wu...

01:46.173 --> 01:49.145
... despatched a huge naval force from the capital...

01:49.212 --> 01:51.182
... to counter the enemy

01:55.292 --> 01:57.022
Her first thought was

01:57.028 --> 01:58.998
to wrong-foot those against in court

01:59.065 --> 02:00.227
Little did she know...

02:00.235 --> 02:02.068
... that a weird crime...

02:02.106 --> 02:04.076
... would have its origin here

02:12.126 --> 02:13.185
Admiral! Moving our troops by night...

02:13.228 --> 02:16.064
... may disturb the spirits

02:16.167 --> 02:18.137
We have better placate them with prayers

02:18.339 --> 02:21.106
Prayers when a great battle is looming?

02:21.245 --> 02:23.112
No more of this effeminate superstition!

02:23.115 --> 02:25.085
Yes, Sir!

02:36.208 --> 02:39.078
Report! On the sea...

02:39.181 --> 02:41.345
... a half-li away, there are movements

02:42.154 --> 02:44.090
Alert the main warship! Yes, Sir!

02:44.158 --> 02:46.185
Alert the main warship!

02:49.202 --> 02:50.261
Our patrol ship...

02:50.270 --> 02:52.240
... has sent us a warning

02:53.210 --> 02:55.112
All ships on full alert!

02:55.114 --> 02:56.139
Order all our sentinels

02:56.182 --> 02:58.118
... to scan the sea for movements

02:58.120 --> 02:59.213
On guard and full alert! All sentinels!

02:59.256 --> 03:01.226
Watch for movements on the sea!

03:01.293 --> 03:03.263
Report all sightings immediately!

03:04.333 --> 03:06.200
It seems the enemy is out there...

03:06.203 --> 03:08.173
And getting closer!

03:46.419 --> 03:48.321
The ship is about to capsize!

03:48.323 --> 03:51.193
Quick, grab it!

03:51.329 --> 03:53.265
Steer away from the ship to starboard!

03:53.299 --> 03:55.269
Quick!

03:57.174 --> 03:59.144
Quick, grab it!

04:13.240 --> 04:15.233
On our right side, our Horse Ship is being attacked!

04:15.378 --> 04:17.348
Call for reinforcemens! Yes, Sir!

04:18.250 --> 04:19.309
Call for reinforcemens!

04:19.351 --> 04:21.322
Yes, Sir!

04:40.429 --> 04:42.228
Rescue them from the water!

04:42.233 --> 04:43.326
Guard against further attacks!

04:43.335 --> 04:45.237
Yes, Sir!

04:45.272 --> 04:47.243
Quick!

05:48.502 --> 05:50.438
Order all ships afloat...

05:50.439 --> 05:52.306
... to rescue the admiral!

05:52.310 --> 05:53.278
Yes, Sir!

05:53.312 --> 05:55.282
It's coming towards us!

06:13.553 --> 06:15.523
Young Detective Dee

06:17.494 --> 06:20.466
Rise of the Sea Dragon

07:13.476 --> 07:15.412
The attack on the navy...

07:15.413 --> 07:16.574
... was blamed on a "Sea Dragon"...

07:16.615 --> 07:18.585
... supposedly disturbed by the warships

07:22.427 --> 07:24.397
This rumor...

07:24.431 --> 07:26.401
... made the city's anxious common people...

07:26.535 --> 07:28.437
... panic even more

07:28.472 --> 07:30.442
They pay handsomely for prayer rituals

07:32.615 --> 07:34.585
The commoners put their own lives first

07:34.652 --> 07:36.622
They don't care who else lives or dies

07:36.656 --> 07:38.455
To placate the "Sea Dragon"...

07:38.493 --> 07:40.463
... they've chosen a young woman for the rites

07:40.531 --> 07:42.501
The streets are thronged with onlookers

07:42.501 --> 07:44.471
The roads are blocked

07:45.574 --> 07:47.476
I, Dee...

07:47.511 --> 07:48.570
... have just come to...

07:48.580 --> 07:50.550
... this strange and turbulent city of the gods

07:50.584 --> 07:52.555
I must report for duty at the Da Lisi

07:53.591 --> 07:55.561
They're not only blocking my way...

07:56.464 --> 07:58.559
... but also that of an official from the Da Lisi

08:00.438 --> 08:02.408
It looks as if he's on his way to investigate something

08:03.711 --> 08:06.649
This young man in court robes of the Third Rank...

08:08.488 --> 08:10.458
... will become my adversary

08:10.558 --> 08:12.528
Both foe and friend

08:14.634 --> 08:16.536
Notify Lord Yang...

08:16.538 --> 08:18.474
Her Majesty will visit the dock...

08:18.509 --> 08:19.568
... to investigate what happened

08:19.577 --> 08:20.670
We must not make the slightest mistake

08:20.680 --> 08:22.650
Our heads are at risk!

08:28.696 --> 08:30.495
You go to the Naval Department...

08:30.533 --> 08:31.558
Commandeer five metal ships

08:31.601 --> 08:32.626
And 200 naval ratings

08:32.638 --> 08:34.607
Deploy them before dusk. Search for clues on the spot!

08:34.674 --> 08:36.645
Yes, Sir!

09:16.661 --> 09:18.631
Come over here!

09:32.626 --> 09:34.528
As you can see...

09:34.564 --> 09:36.534
This is Luoyang, city of the gods

09:56.642 --> 09:58.670
The place has no security

09:59.548 --> 10:01.519
It'll be easy to kidnap the girl

10:01.553 --> 10:03.523
But don't harm a hair on her head!

10:03.557 --> 10:04.650
When we re-sell her...

10:04.692 --> 10:05.819
... we'll get the best price

10:05.828 --> 10:07.798
What does that fellow want?

10:09.702 --> 10:11.672
Should we get rid of him?

10:12.608 --> 10:14.578
Don't complicate things

10:14.746 --> 10:16.716
Move!

10:29.743 --> 10:30.836
Reporting to Your Majesty

10:30.879 --> 10:32.678
The facts are these

10:32.683 --> 10:33.742
Commoners dedicate rites to the Sea Dragon...

10:33.785 --> 10:35.584
... because the city's merchants call for them

10:35.588 --> 10:36.681
They wish to make quick money from selling joss sticks

10:36.724 --> 10:37.749
So they urge the people to perform rites

10:37.794 --> 10:39.764
do you know whose idea it was...

10:39.831 --> 10:41.801
... to organize this kind of rite?

10:42.670 --> 10:44.663
Yes, the Ritual Department follows...

10:44.774 --> 10:45.867
... the "turtle divination"...

10:45.876 --> 10:47.709
to choose a courtesan...

10:47.747 --> 10:49.717
... to be disciplined in the Sea Dragon Temple for 3 years

10:49.718 --> 10:51.688
A courtesan?

10:51.755 --> 10:54.625
This girl has been chosen as the "Courtesan of Luoyang"

10:54.828 --> 10:56.764
She's Yin Ruiji

10:56.798 --> 10:58.597
It's said that Yin Ruiji refused...

10:58.602 --> 10:59.866
... all clients after being chosen

10:59.872 --> 11:01.865
This has offended many officials and wealthy patrons

11:02.711 --> 11:04.681
She was chosen to be sent to the temple

11:04.782 --> 11:06.809
... because those men wanted to teach her a lesson

11:07.755 --> 11:09.657
Absurd!

11:09.692 --> 11:11.719
One courtesan causes so much commotion in the city!

11:11.863 --> 11:13.730
You are the Chief Minister at the Da Lisi

11:13.733 --> 11:14.826
Why haven't you intervened?

11:14.835 --> 11:15.860
Your Majesty

11:15.904 --> 11:17.737
The Da Lisi is charged with investigations and arrests

11:17.775 --> 11:19.745
Controlling such rites is not one of my duties

11:20.647 --> 11:22.617
A poor excuse!

11:22.719 --> 11:23.812
Then tell me...

11:23.821 --> 11:24.880
... what you've discovered...

11:24.923 --> 11:26.722
... about the sunken battleships?

11:26.727 --> 11:28.890
These two ships were less damaged, they've been hauled back to dock

11:29.733 --> 11:30.894
The other ships couldn't be saved and are lost

11:30.902 --> 11:32.872
Don't tell me what I know already!

11:33.707 --> 11:35.677
I am still investigating

11:35.678 --> 11:36.907
And what's your line of enquiry?

11:36.914 --> 11:38.850
If there really is a Sea Dragon...

11:38.884 --> 11:40.912
... our Tang Dynasty may as well give up the fight

11:42.860 --> 11:44.830
Yuchi

11:44.897 --> 11:47.664
Your Da Lisi is famous for quick results

11:47.803 --> 11:49.739
This case is extremely urgent

11:49.774 --> 11:51.903
We cannot allow villains to unleash such chaos

11:52.880 --> 11:54.850
Tell me, how many days do you need?

11:57.723 --> 11:58.850
The country is in peril

11:58.859 --> 12:00.692
So I will set you a deadline

12:00.729 --> 12:01.857
Ten days

12:01.866 --> 12:03.836
If you can't solve the case in ten days...

12:03.903 --> 12:05.873
... I'll have your head

12:05.974 --> 12:07.944
Yes, your Majesty

12:09.781 --> 12:11.876
Using a 'flower girl' to stir things up...

12:12.821 --> 12:13.880
These old court nobles...

12:13.923 --> 12:15.893
... must be up to something

12:25.714 --> 12:26.704
Sir

12:26.750 --> 12:28.720
I've come from Bing County, reporting for duty at Da Lisi

12:28.887 --> 12:31.791
DA LISI (JUSTICE DEPARTMENT)

12:32.862 --> 12:34.798
Dee

12:34.799 --> 12:36.769
You were a bailiff in Bing County

12:36.836 --> 12:37.861
And you've been...

12:37.905 --> 12:38.964
... in jail as well

12:38.974 --> 12:40.944
Yes, Sir

12:42.815 --> 12:45.845
Official Yan recommends you and sent you here on your release from jail

12:46.791 --> 12:48.693
Since you've been in jail...

12:48.728 --> 12:50.698
... you should know exactly how things are done

12:50.865 --> 12:52.835
CHENG AN, RECEPTION OFFICER

12:54.807 --> 12:56.777
Where's your courtesy payment?

12:57.779 --> 12:59.749
Why look so blank?

12:59.850 --> 13:02.788
You're reporting as an official of the 7th rank

13:02.956 --> 13:04.823
Your courtesy money should be...

13:04.860 --> 13:06.831
... 5 taels of silver, at least

13:09.871 --> 13:11.841
I'm talking to you

13:24.868 --> 13:26.838
Don't complicate things

13:26.873 --> 13:28.900
Focus on kidnapping that girl. Get moving!

13:43.840 --> 13:45.833
SEA DRAGON TEMPLE

13:50.955 --> 13:52.982
The place has no security

13:53.928 --> 13:55.898
It'll be easy to kidnap the girl

14:01.810 --> 14:02.835
Dee!

14:02.846 --> 14:04.007
Are you day-dreaming?

14:04.048 --> 14:05.881
Send men to the Sea Dragon Temple, quickly!

14:05.918 --> 14:07.854
The're kidnapping the courtesan! What?

14:07.856 --> 14:09.826
You're mad!

14:09.826 --> 14:10.852
Come back!

14:10.863 --> 14:12.833
Don't leave!

14:12.967 --> 14:14.060
My badge!

14:14.102 --> 14:16.072
Guards!

14:16.073 --> 14:18.043
The new arrival is mad!

14:18.879 --> 14:20.849
Guards! Come quickly!

14:20.983 --> 14:22.953
Urgent command! Stand back!

14:36.882 --> 14:38.077
I am Ruiyun, a Taoist priest

14:38.084 --> 14:40.054
I am ordered to help Lady Ruiji to fast

14:40.122 --> 14:42.092
Thank you

14:52.080 --> 14:54.950
I heard that you excel in the tea ceremony

14:55.053 --> 14:56.818
Before you fast...

14:56.857 --> 14:58.827
... please take this famous Fragrant Rain tea

14:58.994 --> 15:00.964
Priest, you are kind

15:01.031 --> 15:03.024
Madam, please teach me

15:33.064 --> 15:34.897
On Da Lisi duty!

15:34.901 --> 15:36.062
Make way!

15:36.103 --> 15:38.073
On Da Lisi duty! Make way!

15:39.009 --> 15:40.979
Make way!

15:43.117 --> 15:44.950
Stay away! Quick!

15:44.988 --> 15:46.149
That's the young man we just saw, isn't it?

15:46.157 --> 15:48.127
Why does he have a Da Lisi badge?

16:09.004 --> 16:10.063
What? You're not allowed in here

16:10.106 --> 16:12.076
On Da Lisi duty! Stay back!

16:13.012 --> 16:14.140
Stop!

16:14.181 --> 16:16.151
Make way!

16:25.972 --> 16:27.942
You can't go in!

16:37.028 --> 16:38.998
Boss!

16:39.132 --> 16:40.191
Why haven't you left?

16:40.201 --> 16:42.171
You've got the girl, let's go!

21:42.385 --> 21:44.355
Quick!

22:31.553 --> 22:35.357
A spirit of the Sea Dragon!

22:35.594 --> 22:37.564
Sir!

22:38.500 --> 22:40.436
A spirit of the Sea Dragon! Sir!

22:40.438 --> 22:42.408
They all say it was a spirit of the Sea Dragon!

22:44.446 --> 22:46.416
A spirit of the Sea Dragon!

22:49.490 --> 22:51.460
A spirit of the Sea Dragon!

22:53.598 --> 22:55.534
"Don't let this get out"

22:55.535 --> 22:57.505
"Arrest all of them!"

23:00.545 --> 23:02.481
The creature is loose outside

23:02.516 --> 23:04.486
It's pointless to arrest anyone here

23:11.468 --> 23:13.438
So you can read lips

23:13.572 --> 23:15.542
What else do you know?

23:16.445 --> 23:18.438
These kidnappers and the creature are not in league

23:18.549 --> 23:20.519
The kidnappers are mere criminals

23:20.520 --> 23:22.490
I saw them on the street during the parade

23:23.392 --> 23:25.362
I read their lips...

23:25.463 --> 23:27.433
... and deduced they were kidnapping the courtesan

23:27.567 --> 23:29.537
Who are you?

23:29.538 --> 23:31.405
What are you doing here?

23:31.408 --> 23:32.638
My name is Dee

23:32.645 --> 23:34.478
Here on Minister Yan's recommendation

23:34.515 --> 23:36.485
Working for the Da Lisi

23:36.486 --> 23:38.422
I sensed something bad at Sea Dragon Temple

23:38.456 --> 23:39.481
So I rushed here to stop it

23:39.492 --> 23:40.551
How did you sense something would happen here?

23:40.594 --> 23:41.619
Furthermore...

23:41.663 --> 23:43.656
Why do you wear a Da Lisi badge?

23:45.437 --> 23:47.407
I snatched it from somebody there

23:48.677 --> 23:50.579
So the horse isn't yours either

23:50.581 --> 23:52.552
I just borrowed it

23:52.586 --> 23:54.453
Arrest him...

23:54.489 --> 23:55.684
... and treat him as a suspect too!

23:55.725 --> 23:57.695
Prepare a severe punishment! Yes, Sir!

24:04.476 --> 24:06.537
Send Lady Yin back to Swallow House and have her sen by a doctor

24:06.714 --> 24:08.479
Now...

24:08.484 --> 24:10.454
... start looking for that creature!

24:23.615 --> 24:28.455
SWALLOW HOUSE

24:32.701 --> 24:34.671
These men are Lady Yin Ruiji's patrons

24:35.506 --> 24:36.702
Yes, Sir!

24:36.709 --> 24:38.679
Send them all away!

24:48.599 --> 24:50.569
I am from the Da Lisi

25:20.599 --> 25:22.569
Who are you? What do you want?

25:23.571 --> 25:24.732
Why are you here?

25:24.774 --> 25:26.539
I am Yuchi...

25:26.577 --> 25:27.738
... Chief Minister of the Da Lisi

25:27.780 --> 25:29.750
You were endangered at the temple today

25:29.750 --> 25:31.617
Luckily I got there just in time...

25:31.654 --> 25:33.590
... to fight off the villains

25:33.591 --> 25:34.650
You inhaled poison gas...

25:34.693 --> 25:36.526
... which has left you dizzy

25:36.531 --> 25:37.590
But your health wil recover

25:37.634 --> 25:38.761
If convenient...

25:38.803 --> 25:40.773
I would like to question you

25:42.811 --> 25:44.781
Please forgive me, Sir!

25:45.650 --> 25:47.620
My mind is still in a fog

25:47.720 --> 25:49.690
Can we do it another day?

25:49.691 --> 25:51.661
Another day?

25:52.630 --> 25:54.566
We will be outside to protect you

25:54.601 --> 25:56.571
I will return tomorrow

25:58.777 --> 26:00.770
You have so much calligraphy and painting

26:01.616 --> 26:03.586
It seems that you are fond of poetry

26:11.769 --> 26:13.739
Any findings in the Naval Department search?

26:15.611 --> 26:17.581
Kuang hasn't reported yet

26:18.684 --> 26:19.743
Sir

26:19.786 --> 26:21.756
Our sacred city has now seen two dragons

26:21.824 --> 26:23.589
One in the sea

26:23.594 --> 26:25.564
One at the temple

26:29.640 --> 26:30.608
The attack on our warships...

26:30.608 --> 26:31.667
... and the creature at the temple...

26:31.677 --> 26:32.804
... are different matters

26:32.846 --> 26:33.814
We'll start with...

26:33.848 --> 26:35.818
... what happened at the temple

26:35.852 --> 26:37.789
If the case isn't cracked within ten days...

26:37.823 --> 26:39.793
... you'll have my place and rank

26:39.861 --> 26:41.797
I want Swallow House sealed!

26:41.798 --> 26:42.788
Yes, Sir!

26:42.833 --> 26:44.598
Prepare pen and ink

26:44.604 --> 26:45.629
I want to write poems

26:45.673 --> 26:46.766
Write poems?

26:46.775 --> 26:48.745
Just for self-appeasement

26:48.779 --> 26:50.749
Yes, Sir!

26:52.720 --> 26:54.747
DA LISI

26:59.902 --> 27:01.872
You're a demon!

27:01.906 --> 27:03.876
Don't touch my wounds!

27:04.745 --> 27:06.681
You bastard!

27:06.716 --> 27:08.686
Idiot!

27:08.720 --> 27:10.622
Don't... don't touch!

27:10.623 --> 27:12.593
You animal! Hands off!

27:12.861 --> 27:14.831
Get your hands off!

27:16.769 --> 27:19.639
SHATUO, PRISON MEDICAL HELPER

27:22.647 --> 27:24.618
Shatuo

27:24.919 --> 27:26.889
Fate plays strange tricks

27:27.725 --> 27:29.695
It brings us together here

27:35.741 --> 27:36.834
Keep quiet!

27:36.843 --> 27:38.745
Have we met?

27:38.781 --> 27:40.751
You're a Uighur from the Huihe tribe

27:40.785 --> 27:42.779
You lost your family in the "Battle of Black Mountain"

27:42.923 --> 27:44.893
You serve Imperial Doctor Wang Pu

27:44.927 --> 27:46.897
Tell me, do I know you or not?

27:48.802 --> 27:50.772
Who are you?

27:51.674 --> 27:52.903
I have no idea who you are

27:52.910 --> 27:54.743
You came to the capital less than half a year ago

27:54.747 --> 27:55.840
Studied in the Imperial Doctor's Department

27:55.882 --> 27:57.852
Unluckily, you were made a medical helper...

27:57.953 --> 27:59.923
... responsible for criminals

27:59.958 --> 28:01.894
You admired the girl next door

28:01.929 --> 28:03.796
But when you saw her, you were too shy...

28:03.799 --> 28:04.858
... to speak to her

28:04.901 --> 28:06.837
What do you want from me?

28:06.872 --> 28:08.739
I matter a lot to you

28:08.776 --> 28:09.971
Your fate will change because of me

28:09.978 --> 28:11.811
I know all about your history.

28:11.815 --> 28:13.717
And your future is in my hands

28:13.719 --> 28:15.689
I can help change your fate

28:15.723 --> 28:17.693
But you have to do one thing for me

28:18.829 --> 28:20.731
He's sick!

28:20.733 --> 28:22.703
I need to examine him

28:25.811 --> 28:27.781
Tell me

28:27.781 --> 28:29.751
Do you have Cat's-paw herbs?

28:32.758 --> 28:34.728
This is the letter recommending Dee

28:38.002 --> 28:39.972
Recommendation letter...

28:40.807 --> 28:42.777
Recommended by Public Court Minister Yan...

28:42.912 --> 28:44.883
Even if the Emperor himself had written this...

28:44.883 --> 28:46.853
... Dee won't get past me!

28:47.989 --> 28:49.959
Sir...

28:50.027 --> 28:51.997
What's going on?

28:52.999 --> 28:54.866
What's this sudden problem?

28:54.903 --> 28:56.873
Keep your distance!

28:56.941 --> 28:58.774
This prisoner...

28:58.811 --> 29:00.781
... has a contagious disease

29:00.782 --> 29:01.977
He must be isolated in the doctor's room

29:01.984 --> 29:03.010
If not...

29:03.020 --> 29:04.990
... this whole prison will be infected

29:10.769 --> 29:11.930
What kind of sickness is it?

29:11.938 --> 29:12.997
Sir...

29:13.007 --> 29:14.874
This is poisonous measles

29:14.911 --> 29:16.972
Untreated, it causes blindness and paralysis

29:17.883 --> 29:19.853
We can contain it by isolating him now

29:19.887 --> 29:21.014
If we fail to act...

29:21.056 --> 29:22.923
... everyone in he Da Lisi...

29:22.927 --> 29:24.829
... will be infected

29:24.831 --> 29:26.801
Quick! Sir!

29:38.960 --> 29:40.930
Aren't you staying to guard him?

29:40.964 --> 29:42.934
No way!

29:48.012 --> 29:49.776
Sit up

29:49.816 --> 29:50.909
No more acting

29:50.918 --> 29:51.977
How did you know?

29:52.020 --> 29:53.887
Cat's-paw causes a rash on the skin

29:53.891 --> 29:55.861
You've studied medicine?

29:55.928 --> 29:57.898
I've been allergic to cat's-paw since I was young

29:58.834 --> 30:00.804
It always gives me a rash

30:00.938 --> 30:02.908
It goes away soon enough

30:03.877 --> 30:05.813
How did you get the keys?

30:05.848 --> 30:07.818
I stole them from the guard

30:08.053 --> 30:09.989
You know...

30:09.990 --> 30:11.857
That powder of yours works very well

30:11.894 --> 30:13.864
It melts in the mouth

30:15.000 --> 30:16.867
You're a crafty man

30:16.904 --> 30:17.963
Tell me...

30:17.973 --> 30:19.066
We two have never met before

30:19.109 --> 30:21.079
How did you know so much about me?

30:21.881 --> 30:23.851
And you weren't even polite to me!

30:23.852 --> 30:25.822
But I kept on talking to you!

30:28.895 --> 30:30.866
Well... You see...

30:31.100 --> 30:33.901
I saw your name-plate on the duty board

30:34.875 --> 30:36.845
Shatuo is a common Uighur surname in Huihe

30:37.012 --> 30:38.002
Not may from Huihe...

30:38.047 --> 30:40.017
... work as government doctors

30:40.051 --> 30:41.918
Seeing your age...

30:41.955 --> 30:43.082
... I guessed that nine years ago...

30:43.091 --> 30:44.059
... you were one of the "Black Mountain" orphans...

30:44.059 --> 30:45.926
... saved by the army

30:45.930 --> 30:47.091
But how did you know...

30:47.099 --> 30:49.070
,,, that my master is Imperial Doctor Wang Pu?

30:49.905 --> 30:50.999
Before I arrived...

30:51.041 --> 30:53.011
... I read the records of the Da Lisi for recent years

30:53.078 --> 30:54.911
I found there...

30:54.949 --> 30:56.919
... a note that this prison lacks doctors

30:57.053 --> 30:58.955
So they intended to ask Wang Pu...

30:58.957 --> 31:00.927
... for eight medical helpers to be assigned here

31:00.994 --> 31:02.964
Your name wasn't on the list

31:03.032 --> 31:05.002
I read those records about half a year ago

31:05.169 --> 31:06.968
So I guessed that...

31:06.973 --> 31:08.943
... you'd been in the Da Lisi for less than half a year

31:09.979 --> 31:11.107
You're saying that...

31:11.149 --> 31:13.016
... you read the Da Lisi records...

31:13.053 --> 31:14.920
... and memorized them all?

31:14.957 --> 31:16.927
The first rule of investigation is...

31:16.927 --> 31:18.897
... forget nothing!

31:18.965 --> 31:20.867
But the official records won't show...

31:20.902 --> 31:22.872
... that I was unlucky

31:24.175 --> 31:26.145
Medical helper is the lowest rank

31:26.914 --> 31:28.884
It's unworthy of your curative skills

31:29.051 --> 31:31.021
Would you say you've been lucky?

31:33.194 --> 31:35.164
As for admiring the girl next door...

31:35.164 --> 31:37.134
You want to ask how I knew?

31:37.904 --> 31:39.167
I just guessed

31:39.172 --> 31:41.142
What?

31:42.078 --> 31:44.048
It wasn't a wild guess

31:44.116 --> 31:46.086
The second rule for investigation...

31:46.120 --> 31:48.090
... is to observe closely

31:48.157 --> 31:50.127
You're the introspective type

31:50.162 --> 31:51.926
If there were a girl next door...

31:51.965 --> 31:53.935
... you might well love her unrequitedly

31:54.170 --> 31:56.072
You're somewhat nervous

31:56.074 --> 31:57.007
Faced by a girl...

31:57.043 --> 31:58.945
... you'd surely be hesitant

31:58.980 --> 32:00.950
I know this

32:04.157 --> 32:05.922
It can't be...

32:05.961 --> 32:07.088
Where do you actually come from?

32:07.096 --> 32:09.066
Minister Yan of the Public Works Department is from my village

32:09.100 --> 32:11.070
He recommended me to work in the Da Lisi

32:11.172 --> 32:13.142
I reported for duty today

32:13.977 --> 32:15.173
You're here to work

32:15.213 --> 32:17.183
So why were you imprisoned?

32:18.052 --> 32:19.988
That's a long story

32:19.990 --> 32:21.960
The Da Lisi is too bureaucratic

32:21.960 --> 32:23.189
Minister Yan recommended me for the post

32:23.229 --> 32:25.199
He thought I could bring some new energy to the place

32:26.035 --> 32:27.128
You have to help me...

32:27.170 --> 32:29.140
... to get out and investigate the case

32:31.178 --> 32:33.149
Where to?

32:33.217 --> 32:35.187
There's an infectious disease in the prison

32:35.221 --> 32:37.123
The officials want us...

32:37.158 --> 32:39.128
... to consult the Imperial Doctor

32:39.262 --> 32:41.129
Do you need to check my specimen box?

32:41.133 --> 32:42.192
Inside it are specimens...

32:42.235 --> 32:44.205
... of vomit from infected prisoners and their hair as well

32:45.141 --> 32:46.200
Fine, fine...

32:46.209 --> 32:48.179
On your way. Open the gate!

33:50.174 --> 33:51.199
Madam

33:51.242 --> 33:53.212
I'll go to prepare the medicine

34:21.204 --> 34:23.174
My jade hairpin...

34:34.264 --> 34:36.234
What's your business?

34:37.371 --> 34:39.273
I am government doctor Shatuo

34:39.275 --> 34:41.210
I am ordered to take up shift duty here

34:41.212 --> 34:43.205
Who is he? My assistant

34:43.349 --> 34:45.319
Dumb Wu

34:46.355 --> 34:48.154
Why are you wearing hats?

34:48.159 --> 34:50.129
Take off your hats!

35:04.192 --> 35:06.162
Go!

35:30.345 --> 35:32.178
Stay back!

35:32.182 --> 35:34.152
Stay back!

35:48.215 --> 35:49.342
How could you know...

35:49.384 --> 35:51.354
... that I hid Mr Yuan's love letters there?

35:54.227 --> 35:56.197
What have you done to Mr Yuan?

35:58.269 --> 36:00.239
YUAN ZHEN

36:13.400 --> 36:16.372
You're not Mr Yuan, are you?

36:25.291 --> 36:26.452
You're...

36:26.460 --> 36:28.430
... the Courtesan of Luoyang

36:29.266 --> 36:30.427
Admired by thousands of people

36:30.468 --> 36:32.404
While I, Yuan Zhen, don't even have an official post

36:32.405 --> 36:34.432
Yet you've chosen me as your "First Patron"

36:35.245 --> 36:37.215
I've always loved literature

36:37.282 --> 36:39.184
I've read your poem, Mr Yuan

36:39.219 --> 36:41.189
The famous "Four Melancholy Verses"

36:41.390 --> 36:43.360
I adore it

36:45.298 --> 36:47.462
"Flute merged in the scented smoke"

36:48.372 --> 36:51.276
"accompanies dances of youthful years"

36:52.413 --> 36:55.283
"Lovers are to bring earth to heaven"

36:55.452 --> 36:59.222
"Even trading life for advent of passion"

37:04.304 --> 37:06.274
Dear Mr Yuan!

37:06.409 --> 37:09.313
How could you have changed like this?

37:22.541 --> 37:25.274
Who harmed you like this?

37:29.456 --> 37:31.426
Was it because of me?

37:33.530 --> 37:36.263
Did they harm you like this because of me?

37:38.440 --> 37:39.430
Madam

37:39.476 --> 37:41.446
The medicine is ready

37:41.480 --> 37:43.450
Madam

37:55.542 --> 37:57.512
They are guards from the Da Lisi

37:57.579 --> 37:59.549
Something must be going on here

38:00.385 --> 38:02.355
Someone's coming!

38:13.479 --> 38:15.506
That must be Ruiji's room she took the medicine to

38:32.618 --> 38:34.520
Mr Yuan...

38:34.555 --> 38:36.525
What are you trying to tell me?

39:59.529 --> 40:00.656
Light on

40:00.665 --> 40:02.635
Light off

40:11.587 --> 40:13.523
On

40:13.524 --> 40:15.495
Off

40:28.755 --> 40:30.691
On

40:30.692 --> 40:32.663
Off

40:41.515 --> 40:42.642
(East Island language Dondo) Something's wrong!

40:42.684 --> 40:44.654
(Dondo) Retreat!

41:42.807 --> 41:44.777
Hide Lady Ruiji at once

41:58.706 --> 42:00.676
What's taking so long?

42:03.650 --> 42:04.675
Hide inside this trunk

42:04.718 --> 42:05.811
Don't come out unless we call you

42:05.854 --> 42:07.824
Quick!

42:19.883 --> 42:21.853
Give it to me!

42:49.677 --> 42:51.647
It's you again?

43:07.714 --> 43:08.739
How is he?

43:08.749 --> 43:09.774
He's been poisoned by bee-stings

43:09.785 --> 43:11.755
I have a panacea for him

43:13.759 --> 43:15.729
I'll check upstairs

43:36.940 --> 43:38.910
Why did you get out?

43:38.945 --> 43:40.915
I was afraid you wouldn't come back

43:41.683 --> 43:42.879
So I let myself out

43:42.919 --> 43:44.889
You weren't afraid I wouldn't come back

43:45.658 --> 43:46.921
You're afraid that I have come back

43:46.961 --> 43:48.828
I don't know you

43:48.831 --> 43:50.801
Of course I'm afraid

43:51.704 --> 43:53.674
You're not telling the truth

43:53.841 --> 43:55.743
Nonsense!

43:55.745 --> 43:56.838
When a person lies...

43:56.881 --> 43:58.851
Their eyes betray them

44:00.956 --> 44:02.892
and even turn into...

44:02.927 --> 44:04.897
... a lethal stare

44:34.859 --> 44:36.829
Leave at once!

44:40.937 --> 44:42.907
You're on the same side!

44:43.911 --> 44:45.881
Stop it!

44:45.882 --> 44:47.818
If you don't go...

44:47.819 --> 44:49.789
... you can watch me die

45:04.019 --> 45:05.851
Don't go!

45:05.855 --> 45:06.949
It's dangerous for you outside

45:06.991 --> 45:08.961
It would be safest to come with me to the Da Lisi

45:20.852 --> 45:22.822
Making him go puts him in danger

45:22.957 --> 45:24.927
He probably won't survive

45:36.885 --> 45:38.855
What? You're hurt!

45:44.901 --> 45:46.871
It wasn't her!

45:47.073 --> 45:49.043
That creature did it

45:51.950 --> 45:53.920
What are you doing up here? Where's Yuchi?

45:54.087 --> 45:56.057
That official is very safe, don't worry

45:57.828 --> 45:59.798
I thought you could predict everything?

45:59.832 --> 46:01.061
How come you still got hurt?

46:01.101 --> 46:02.900
The third rule of investigations is...

46:02.905 --> 46:04.875
... to keep your head down, not rush in like a fool!

46:21.009 --> 46:22.979
(Dondo) Chief!

46:30.862 --> 46:31.853
(Dondo) Chief!

46:31.898 --> 46:33.059
(Dondo) Alongside Yuchi...

46:33.067 --> 46:34.900
(Dondo) ... there's another strong fighter in the Da Lisi

46:34.904 --> 46:36.874
(Dondo) We feared our identity would be uncovered, so we had to retreat

46:37.142 --> 46:39.112
(Dondo) No-one...

46:48.064 --> 46:49.055
(Dondo) ... no matter how strong...

46:49.100 --> 46:50.898
(Dondo) ... will save Yuan Zhen!

46:50.903 --> 46:52.965
(Dondo) Keep watching the woman

46:53.877 --> 46:55.847
(Dondo) Yuan Zhen is sure to come back for her. Yes, Sir!

46:56.047 --> 46:58.017
(Dondo) Clear away the corpse!

47:10.143 --> 47:12.113
Your Excellency

47:14.018 --> 47:15.988
Fine, fine, on your way!

47:21.967 --> 47:23.937
Dee!

47:28.179 --> 47:30.150
Don't you have a contagious disease?

47:32.121 --> 47:34.091
Why have you come in here?

47:35.996 --> 47:37.898
Shatuo!

47:37.933 --> 47:39.903
Isn't Shatuo guarding him?

47:39.937 --> 47:41.907
Sir, your blade...

47:50.091 --> 47:52.027
What is it?

47:52.028 --> 47:53.999
Your Excellency

47:54.100 --> 47:56.070
Arrange a place for Madam Yin Ruiji to rest at once

47:57.006 --> 47:58.031
Also...

47:58.041 --> 48:00.011
Register Dee for work immediately

48:00.112 --> 48:02.082
Come on. Move!

48:09.096 --> 48:11.066
TRANQUILLITY TEAHOUSE

48:11.201 --> 48:12.999
Boss... Boss...

48:13.205 --> 48:15.175
Minister Wang wants the young boss to discuss poetry

48:16.011 --> 48:17.036
Minister Wang

48:17.047 --> 48:19.017
Please accept our small gift of Bird's Tongue tea

48:19.084 --> 48:21.054
May you have vitality and a clear mind

48:21.055 --> 48:22.922
May your wishes be fulfilled

48:22.959 --> 48:24.929
Your young boss left here so suddenly

48:25.029 --> 48:26.156
When will he return?

48:26.165 --> 48:27.190
In reply, Your Excellency...

48:27.233 --> 48:28.964
Our young boss...

48:28.971 --> 48:30.964
... has been away on travels for over half a year

48:31.108 --> 48:32.202
No news reaches us

48:32.244 --> 48:34.214
We don't know when he'll be back

48:37.221 --> 48:39.088
Then I'll chat with him again when he returns

48:39.125 --> 48:40.218
His Excellency is leaving!

48:40.260 --> 48:42.230
Goodbye, Sir!

48:57.229 --> 48:58.994
Sir

48:58.999 --> 49:00.160
This man was imprisoned in Bing County

49:00.168 --> 49:02.070
Shouldn't we check up on him?

49:02.105 --> 49:04.075
Find out what he's after in the Da Lisi

49:04.109 --> 49:06.079
Assign men to watch him closely

49:06.080 --> 49:08.073
If he does anything unusual, report it to me!

49:34.270 --> 49:36.241
I forced Mr Yuan to flee

49:37.043 --> 49:39.013
Was that really wrong of me?

49:39.181 --> 49:41.174
I beg you, Sir, to save his life

49:43.156 --> 49:45.058
Mr Yuan...

49:45.093 --> 49:47.063
... is your friend

49:47.064 --> 49:48.157
Can you tell me...

49:48.199 --> 49:50.169
... who is he??

49:50.203 --> 49:52.139
His name is Yuan Zhen

49:52.141 --> 49:55.113
Everyone in Luoyang knows the Tranquillity Teahouse, where he's the young boss

49:56.149 --> 49:57.345
Renowned in Luoyang...

49:57.352 --> 49:59.185
The Tranquillity Teahouse

49:59.222 --> 50:01.089
Yes, Your Excellency

50:01.093 --> 50:02.083
Tranquillity Teahouse

50:02.128 --> 50:04.257
They make special tea for nobles and officials

50:05.101 --> 50:07.071
So, a famous teahouse...

50:07.105 --> 50:08.300
What happened to its young boss...

50:08.340 --> 50:10.310
... to change him like that?

50:11.113 --> 50:13.083
This all began half a year ago

50:19.330 --> 50:21.197
At that time...

50:21.234 --> 50:23.204
... I joined the New Year "Hundred Flowers" pageant

50:23.305 --> 50:25.241
I was named "Courtesan of Luoyang"

50:25.242 --> 50:27.212
I became famous overnight

50:49.391 --> 50:51.361
Once I had that title...

50:52.130 --> 50:54.123
... the elite of the city all wanted to meet me

50:54.268 --> 50:56.238
Each wanted to be my first patron

50:56.372 --> 50:58.342
But their eminence didn't move me

50:58.410 --> 51:00.380
Nor did their wealth

51:01.148 --> 51:02.378
I was working in a flower house

51:02.385 --> 51:04.355
I knew what to expect from life there

51:05.324 --> 51:07.351
Only the young boss of Tranquillity Teahouse, Yuan Zhen...

51:08.263 --> 51:10.233
... touched me with his love poems

51:15.244 --> 51:17.180
I got around all the flower-house rules

51:17.214 --> 51:18.273
I paid them no heed

51:18.283 --> 51:20.253
And I met him in secret

51:23.428 --> 51:25.398
Young boss... Madam Yin of Swallow House is here

51:26.267 --> 51:27.326
Later...

51:27.369 --> 51:29.202
I gave him my jade peacock hairpin...

51:29.239 --> 51:31.209
... as a token of my love

51:31.210 --> 51:33.203
We wanted to read each other's mind

51:33.348 --> 51:35.318
We were very close

51:35.352 --> 51:37.151
After that...

51:37.155 --> 51:39.125
I wrote love poems and sent them to Mr Yuan

51:39.226 --> 51:41.196
He responded very promptly

51:41.297 --> 51:43.268
But he stopped visiting me

51:43.369 --> 51:45.339
In a poem, he mentioned contracting an illness

51:45.439 --> 51:47.409
That made me worried

51:49.447 --> 51:51.246
And then...

51:51.251 --> 51:53.221
I was chosen to fast for the Sea Dragon

51:53.255 --> 51:55.191
I told him about it in a poem...

51:55.192 --> 51:57.162
... but he never replied

51:58.232 --> 52:00.202
Only yesterday...

52:00.470 --> 52:03.340
... when he came to see me with my hairpin...

52:08.253 --> 52:10.223
... did I realize...

52:12.327 --> 52:14.297
... did I realize that he'd become...

52:17.504 --> 52:19.474
This haipin looks so precious...

52:20.210 --> 52:22.180
Its color is faded?

52:22.347 --> 52:24.318
Not really...

52:24.419 --> 52:26.286
I think...

52:26.290 --> 52:28.453
In Mr Yuan's care, it must have been tainted by something

52:30.465 --> 52:32.435
Please lend me the hairpin for a while

52:38.447 --> 52:40.417
They...

52:44.292 --> 52:45.352
They arrested someone...

52:45.362 --> 52:47.264
... and they are questioning him

52:47.266 --> 52:49.429
I think...You should go and see for yourself

52:51.341 --> 52:53.311
Master Dee...

52:53.478 --> 52:55.448
Mr Yuan left this yesterday

52:55.516 --> 52:57.486
I can't understand it

53:04.501 --> 53:06.471
Very good

53:09.311 --> 53:10.438
Oh yes...

53:10.446 --> 53:12.348
I am Dee...

53:12.350 --> 53:14.320
... a pleasure to meet you, Madam Ruiji

53:26.378 --> 53:27.369
Talk!

53:27.415 --> 53:29.385
Will you talk?

53:30.287 --> 53:32.257
Will you talk?

53:33.560 --> 53:35.427
I'll make you talk!

53:35.431 --> 53:37.298
What are you doing here? Let's continue...

53:37.301 --> 53:38.291
Talk now!

53:38.303 --> 53:39.464
The villains lost their masks at the Swallow House

53:39.505 --> 53:41.475
These craftsmen make masks in Luoyang

53:42.345 --> 53:43.472
I am questioning him

53:43.513 --> 53:44.503
Those without duties here...

53:44.549 --> 53:46.348
Leave!

53:46.353 --> 53:47.515
Beat him! Your eyes see nothing!

53:47.522 --> 53:49.389
This mask is made from tree extracts

53:49.393 --> 53:51.363
The raw materials come from Aizhou

53:51.564 --> 53:53.397
The craftsmanship is typical of Eastern lands

53:53.434 --> 53:55.336
It wasn't made by locals here

53:55.338 --> 53:56.397
Furthermore...

53:56.440 --> 53:58.410
the masked villains spoke the Dondo language

53:59.446 --> 54:01.416
(Dondo) Something's wrong, retreat!

54:01.617 --> 54:03.484
Dondo language?

54:03.488 --> 54:05.424
They were definitely Dondoers

54:05.425 --> 54:07.361
What kind of place is Dondo?

54:07.362 --> 54:08.456
Dondo...

54:08.499 --> 54:10.469
It lies in the ocean between Great Tang and Japan

54:11.371 --> 54:13.398
The Islanders have been coming here for years

54:14.344 --> 54:16.314
They live mainly by fishing

54:16.381 --> 54:18.283
They're very good in the water

54:18.319 --> 54:19.378
No wonder...

54:19.387 --> 54:21.357
... they can stay underwater for so long

54:23.462 --> 54:25.432
I found this at the crime scene

54:30.376 --> 54:32.347
What kind of clue is this?

54:45.640 --> 54:47.611
What?

55:01.640 --> 55:03.610
"Bird's Tongue"

55:04.513 --> 55:06.483
It's Bird's Tongue tea

55:06.550 --> 55:07.540
Bird's Tongue tea...

55:07.585 --> 55:09.521
... is a secret recipe at Tranquillity Teahouse

55:09.523 --> 55:11.494
They give the tea to the Imperial court as a tribute

55:11.561 --> 55:12.586
This tea...

55:12.630 --> 55:14.532
Common people never have a chance to taste it

55:14.534 --> 55:17.370
But how does Bird's Tongue tea relate to the case?

55:17.506 --> 55:19.476
Judging by the writing...

55:19.477 --> 55:21.447
... the man who wrote this was in a hurry

55:21.581 --> 55:23.483
Where did you get this?

55:23.518 --> 55:25.488
From the one who tried to kidnap Madam Ruiji

55:25.689 --> 55:27.591
The Sea Dragon seen at the temple!

55:27.593 --> 55:29.495
Why was it in Swallow House last night?

55:29.530 --> 55:30.658
That's not all

55:30.700 --> 55:32.670
I've concluded that the masked Dondoers...

55:33.438 --> 55:35.409
... and the villains at the temple are two separate groups

55:36.545 --> 55:38.412
They raided Swallow House

55:38.416 --> 55:39.611
But they weren't trying to kidnap Ruiji

55:39.651 --> 55:41.621
They were there for the creature

55:42.557 --> 55:44.459
The monster wrote this...

55:44.495 --> 55:45.656
... to leave a clue

55:45.663 --> 55:47.633
To help you solve the mystery, Sir

55:48.469 --> 55:49.528
If you can catch him

55:49.538 --> 55:50.631
The case will soon be cracked

55:50.674 --> 55:52.506
Doubtful!

55:52.511 --> 55:53.571
To Tranquillity Teahouse. Prepare the horses

55:53.614 --> 55:55.584
Yes, Sir!

56:04.469 --> 56:06.439
Stay back! On Da Lisi duty!

56:11.717 --> 56:13.584
Quick!

56:13.621 --> 56:15.591
Quick!

56:36.602 --> 56:37.627
Sir...

56:37.637 --> 56:39.607
There's not a single person in the teahouse

56:39.708 --> 56:41.575
So quickly!

56:41.612 --> 56:43.514
They left in a hurry

56:43.515 --> 56:44.676
They made a quick getaway

56:44.718 --> 56:46.688
Someone must have alerted them

56:47.490 --> 56:49.551
Who could that have been?

57:02.521 --> 57:03.580
Shatuo...

57:03.590 --> 57:05.492
If I don't come back with the other court officials...

57:05.527 --> 57:07.497
... get Lady Ruiji out of the Da Lisi at once

57:19.723 --> 57:21.693
Follow me

57:28.708 --> 57:30.678
So, Dee...

57:30.778 --> 57:32.748
What have you found out?

57:32.782 --> 57:35.549
I've brought Madam Yin Ruiji... to see you too

57:35.722 --> 57:37.693
Master Dee, why did you want me here?

57:37.793 --> 57:39.763
There's a hidden traitor in the Da Lisi. What?

57:40.766 --> 57:42.599
Everyone in Tranquillity Teahouse...

57:42.603 --> 57:44.505
... had left before we got there

57:44.540 --> 57:46.533
So the Da Lisi is not a safe refuge for Lady Ruiji

57:47.580 --> 57:49.550
What about the task I set you?

57:49.784 --> 57:52.517
What substance stained the jade hairpin?

57:53.558 --> 57:55.528
It's a dye made with pine oil

57:55.596 --> 57:56.723
It's called "Shaxi"

57:56.766 --> 57:58.668
Very few dyeing houses use it

57:58.669 --> 58:00.639
Is there one near Swallow House?

58:01.609 --> 58:03.579
It seems there's one in the south of the city

58:03.679 --> 58:05.649
It's called "The Monk's Bowl"

58:09.625 --> 58:10.820
The dye on the jade hairpin...

58:10.827 --> 58:12.592
... can only be from Mr Yuan

58:12.597 --> 58:13.530
He accidentally tainted it...

58:13.566 --> 58:14.591
... with the dye while in hiding

58:14.635 --> 58:16.605
So he might be hiding there

58:16.807 --> 58:18.537
Madam Yin...

58:18.576 --> 58:19.704
Only you can make him show himself

58:19.746 --> 58:21.716
I count on you

58:29.799 --> 58:31.769
Mr Yuan

58:41.691 --> 58:43.661
Mr Yuan

58:47.769 --> 58:49.739
Mr Yuan

58:51.911 --> 58:53.744
Great detective...

58:53.748 --> 58:55.809
Looks like we've got the wrong place

59:16.862 --> 59:18.832
Mr Yuan

59:28.887 --> 59:30.857
Dragon! The Sea Dragon!

59:51.867 --> 59:53.837
Shatuo

59:55.808 --> 59:57.778
Hit the "Tianchi" and "Yunmen" points on his body

59:58.881 --> 01:00:00.783
"Tianchi", "Yunmen"

01:00:00.785 --> 01:00:02.755
Yes!

01:00:15.949 --> 01:00:17.919
Mr Yuan, he...

01:00:17.953 --> 01:00:19.889
What happened to him?

01:00:19.924 --> 01:00:21.894
Mr Yuan's appearance has changed radically

01:00:21.928 --> 01:00:23.899
His human character has changed too

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:25.970
I doubt it's a sickness

01:00:26.739 --> 01:00:28.709
My guess is that he was deliberately exposed to parasites

01:00:28.876 --> 01:00:30.743
What kind of parasite??

01:00:30.747 --> 01:00:32.717
My teacher taught me how to cure parasite infestations

01:00:33.886 --> 01:00:34.945
But this case...

01:00:34.988 --> 01:00:36.855
... is like nothing I've seen

01:00:36.892 --> 01:00:38.862
What are parasites?

01:00:39.731 --> 01:00:41.701
parasites are very tiny insects

01:00:41.802 --> 01:00:43.772
Almost invisible to the eye

01:00:43.907 --> 01:00:45.877
If they penetrate your body...

01:00:45.878 --> 01:00:47.848
... they'll take control of it

01:00:48.851 --> 01:00:49.944
Different types of parasite...

01:00:49.953 --> 01:00:51.923
... cause different changes in a human body

01:00:52.992 --> 01:00:54.962
Can he be cured?

01:00:55.764 --> 01:00:56.891
To cure this infestation

01:00:56.900 --> 01:00:57.993
I need to consult my master

01:00:58.035 --> 01:01:00.005
Imperial Doctor Wang Pu

01:01:02.010 --> 01:01:03.981
Watch out!

01:01:06.786 --> 01:01:08.757
Mr Yuan, don't you...

01:01:10.762 --> 01:01:13.825
I've waited so long to be with you

01:01:18.811 --> 01:01:20.872
Your Ruiji will be with you forever

01:01:22.018 --> 01:01:23.920
No matter how you look...

01:01:23.955 --> 01:01:25.925
... you're always my Mr Yuan

01:01:29.935 --> 01:01:32.736
But you must not harm innocent people

01:01:35.813 --> 01:01:37.783
Please

01:01:38.886 --> 01:01:40.856
They are here to help me

01:02:02.066 --> 01:02:04.036
(Dondo) Look!

01:02:39.076 --> 01:02:40.909
(Dondo) The "Sea God" should rest now

01:02:40.913 --> 01:02:41.972
(Dondo) Let it return to the island to resume its training

01:02:42.015 --> 01:02:43.985
(Dondo) It must be taught to obey all our commands!

01:02:44.086 --> 01:02:46.056
(Dondo) Yes!

01:02:48.995 --> 01:02:50.966
(Dondo) Our tribe's masterplan will soon be brought to fruition!

01:02:51.134 --> 01:02:53.970
(Dondo) The mainland will be ours, we will rule for a thousand years!

01:03:04.160 --> 01:03:06.130
This is my teacher's home

01:03:09.972 --> 01:03:10.997
Senior apprentice!

01:03:11.041 --> 01:03:13.011
Senior apprentice...

01:03:14.949 --> 01:03:16.919
Master's testing poisons on you again

01:03:18.891 --> 01:03:19.916
Save me!

01:03:19.959 --> 01:03:20.949
Don't cry, it'll be fine

01:03:20.961 --> 01:03:22.054
I'll prepare some medicine for you

01:03:22.097 --> 01:03:24.033
Master is much worse recently

01:03:24.034 --> 01:03:26.004
All of us have met disasters! It'll be fine

01:03:57.069 --> 01:04:00.166
First apprentice!

01:04:03.047 --> 01:04:04.174
Master...

01:04:04.216 --> 01:04:06.186
... I'm back

01:04:11.163 --> 01:04:13.964
Since the ape which gave me an arm has fled...

01:04:14.137 --> 01:04:16.130
... I let you go to the Da Lisi so that you could find me a good arm!

01:04:16.208 --> 01:04:17.141
It's been half a year already.

01:04:17.143 --> 01:04:18.976
So where's my arm?

01:04:19.014 --> 01:04:20.209
Didn't you promise?

01:04:20.216 --> 01:04:22.186
I can't transplant without an arm!

01:04:23.055 --> 01:04:24.991
Lately...

01:04:25.026 --> 01:04:26.119
... nobody's been sentenced to death

01:04:26.161 --> 01:04:28.131
So there've been no suitable arms!

01:04:29.067 --> 01:04:31.003
Master...

01:04:31.004 --> 01:04:32.940
I have something...

01:04:32.975 --> 01:04:34.000
which needs your urgent help

01:04:34.010 --> 01:04:34.943
Shut up!

01:04:34.979 --> 01:04:36.972
Our master-disciple relationship is over!

01:04:47.104 --> 01:04:49.131
This is a good arm, let me have it!

01:04:49.208 --> 01:04:50.973
Imperial Doctor

01:04:50.979 --> 01:04:53.142
We're not here to provide an arm

01:04:53.250 --> 01:04:55.048
We're seeking medical help

01:04:55.053 --> 01:04:57.023
Master

01:05:00.031 --> 01:05:02.001
Who is this?

01:05:02.102 --> 01:05:03.001
Master...

01:05:03.037 --> 01:05:03.264
Who is this?

01:05:03.270 --> 01:05:04.169
Let me see

01:05:04.206 --> 01:05:06.176
Mr Yuan, stop it!

01:05:06.176 --> 01:05:08.146
Mr Yuan!

01:05:09.016 --> 01:05:10.986
Mr Yuan!

01:05:21.274 --> 01:05:22.264
Mr Yuan...

01:05:22.276 --> 01:05:24.246
... stop it

01:05:25.282 --> 01:05:27.081
No...

01:05:27.086 --> 01:05:28.247
No...

01:05:28.288 --> 01:05:30.281
They're here to help cure you

01:06:08.237 --> 01:06:09.262
What is he?

01:06:09.272 --> 01:06:11.242
C'mon!

01:06:11.276 --> 01:06:12.301
Get the blades ready

01:06:12.345 --> 01:06:13.335
Put him on the table!

01:06:13.347 --> 01:06:15.317
Chop open his head for me!

01:06:21.197 --> 01:06:23.167
C'mon!

01:06:32.219 --> 01:06:33.209
Sir, why do you think...

01:06:33.221 --> 01:06:34.348
... Dee is here?

01:06:34.356 --> 01:06:36.087
Shatuo led the way

01:06:36.127 --> 01:06:38.097
They 're in Luoyang, where else would they go?

01:06:40.336 --> 01:06:42.100
Sir, should we wait for the others...

01:06:42.105 --> 01:06:42.333
... before we go in to arrest them?

01:06:42.340 --> 01:06:43.308
Wait?

01:06:43.342 --> 01:06:45.312
And risk another information leak?

01:07:41.293 --> 01:07:43.264
Who are you?

01:07:46.404 --> 01:07:47.337
I?

01:07:47.373 --> 01:07:48.341
Who are you?

01:07:48.375 --> 01:07:50.345
Making such a mess in my clinic!

01:07:52.416 --> 01:07:54.386
Your clinic?

01:07:55.389 --> 01:07:57.359
You're Imperial Doctor Wang Pu?

01:07:59.330 --> 01:08:02.234
I am head of the Da Lisi

01:08:02.303 --> 01:08:03.397
Has Dee been here?

01:08:03.439 --> 01:08:04.407
Dee who?

01:08:04.408 --> 01:08:06.378
Never heard of him

01:08:39.379 --> 01:08:41.349
Kuang, watch out!

01:10:19.584 --> 01:10:21.520
Something's going on in Wang Pu's clinic

01:10:21.554 --> 01:10:22.453
Quick!

01:10:22.490 --> 01:10:24.460
Quick!

01:10:24.494 --> 01:10:26.464
HONEY

01:10:42.531 --> 01:10:44.501
Stay back!

01:10:52.618 --> 01:10:54.588
Ku?ng, stay back!

01:11:05.478 --> 01:11:06.503
Sir...

01:11:06.513 --> 01:11:07.481
These Dondoers...

01:11:07.515 --> 01:11:08.414
What are they doing here?

01:11:08.450 --> 01:11:09.418
I've been wondering...

01:11:09.419 --> 01:11:11.446
... if these Dondoers are looking for him too

01:11:15.565 --> 01:11:17.535
Why would they look for Dee?

01:11:19.507 --> 01:11:20.668
This Dee...

01:11:20.675 --> 01:11:22.645
... seems always one step ahead

01:11:23.448 --> 01:11:25.475
Maybe he's hiding now and wants to frame me

01:11:25.552 --> 01:11:27.522
If I miss the deadline...

01:11:27.556 --> 01:11:29.423
.. for solving the case...

01:11:29.460 --> 01:11:31.430
... You'll be executed

01:11:31.464 --> 01:11:32.524
Post notices everywhere...

01:11:32.534 --> 01:11:34.527
... to arrest him as a Dondo spy

01:11:35.440 --> 01:11:36.703
He should turn himself in

01:11:36.708 --> 01:11:38.678
Yes, Sir!

01:11:45.460 --> 01:11:47.430
Why have we come here?

01:11:47.430 --> 01:11:48.591
Who are we hiding from?

01:11:48.632 --> 01:11:50.602
This is where the Fire-worshippers slaughter animals

01:11:50.704 --> 01:11:52.606
There are so many foreigners in Luoyang

01:11:52.608 --> 01:11:54.440
Even if the traitor could track us here...

01:11:54.478 --> 01:11:55.674
... it would take him too long

01:11:55.714 --> 01:11:57.684
The traitor...

01:11:58.553 --> 01:12:00.523
Master Dee...

01:12:01.526 --> 01:12:04.555
Does the Imperial Docctor really need to cut open Mr Yuan?

01:12:05.501 --> 01:12:07.494
It was just his educated way of speaking

01:12:07.571 --> 01:12:09.541
Miss, don't take it literally

01:12:09.609 --> 01:12:10.577
Master!

01:12:10.611 --> 01:12:12.444
Are you really going to cut open his head?

01:12:12.448 --> 01:12:13.473
Certainly!

01:12:13.517 --> 01:12:14.485
This incision...

01:12:14.485 --> 01:12:15.579
... makes me the first man to operate on a brain

01:12:15.588 --> 01:12:17.558
Even the famous Huatuo didn't do this!!

01:12:20.732 --> 01:12:22.702
Yin Ruiji...

01:12:24.740 --> 01:12:26.710
I want to ask you a question

01:12:27.579 --> 01:12:29.640
Your family did not originate in the Middle Kingdom

01:12:29.750 --> 01:12:31.481
Could you tell me...

01:12:31.487 --> 01:12:32.614
... where are the Yins from originally?

01:12:32.656 --> 01:12:34.650
The Fuyu Kingdom

01:12:37.733 --> 01:12:39.703
Your answer confirms my fears

01:12:39.737 --> 01:12:42.470
Our Great Tang is now at war with Fuyu

01:12:42.543 --> 01:12:43.636
The situation is critical

01:12:43.679 --> 01:12:44.738
You're from Fuyu...

01:12:44.781 --> 01:12:46.717
... and you're caught up in this case

01:12:46.718 --> 01:12:49.485
The Imperial Court won't hesitate to sacrifice you

01:12:50.492 --> 01:12:52.462
To be safe...

01:12:52.730 --> 01:12:54.701
As soon as Mr Yuan is cured...

01:12:54.735 --> 01:12:56.728
... you two had better leave the capital

01:12:59.712 --> 01:13:01.511
Master Dee...

01:13:01.515 --> 01:13:02.676
You know everything

01:13:02.718 --> 01:13:04.551
Can you tell me...

01:13:04.555 --> 01:13:06.525
What exactly happened to Mr Yuan?

01:13:06.592 --> 01:13:08.653
The root of this was the "Bird's Tongue" tea

01:13:08.696 --> 01:13:10.666
Dee

01:13:30.574 --> 01:13:32.544
I have curbed the effect of the parasites

01:13:32.612 --> 01:13:33.671
Any question?

01:13:33.681 --> 01:13:35.514
Cook some food...

01:13:35.551 --> 01:13:36.519
... and buy some wine!

01:13:36.553 --> 01:13:37.543
Go at once!

01:13:37.555 --> 01:13:39.753
This has taken so long, I'm dying of hunger!

01:13:47.543 --> 01:13:48.806
Mr Yuan...

01:13:48.845 --> 01:13:50.815
Why are the Dondoers after you?

01:13:51.851 --> 01:13:53.821
Half year ago...

01:13:54.557 --> 01:13:56.527
I received some visitors.

01:13:56.694 --> 01:13:58.664
They said they were tea merchants from the Eastern lands

01:13:58.833 --> 01:14:02.637
They offered me a fortune for the secret recipe of "Bird's Tongue" tea

01:14:04.611 --> 01:14:05.772
But this tea...

01:14:05.813 --> 01:14:07.783
... is exclusive to the imperial court

01:14:07.851 --> 01:14:09.650
For a century, the recipe...

01:14:09.654 --> 01:14:11.681
... has been a Yuan family secret

01:14:11.759 --> 01:14:13.661
So I refused their request...

01:14:13.662 --> 01:14:15.632
And they left unhappy

01:14:16.702 --> 01:14:18.604
A few days later...

01:14:18.639 --> 01:14:20.803
Scales began to appear on my skin

01:14:20.878 --> 01:14:22.848
No medicine helped

01:14:23.717 --> 01:14:25.619
And then...

01:14:25.654 --> 01:14:27.749
I received a letter from a man named Huo Yi...

01:14:27.858 --> 01:14:30.830
He said I'd been infested by parasites

01:14:30.898 --> 01:14:32.800
Apparently...

01:14:32.802 --> 01:14:34.795
... during our tea tasting...

01:14:34.906 --> 01:14:37.707
... Huo Yi put parasites in my cup

01:14:40.885 --> 01:14:42.855
I was so scared

01:14:44.660 --> 01:14:46.755
I dared not to tell anyone

01:14:46.831 --> 01:14:48.892
I had to leave the teahouse

01:14:49.670 --> 01:14:50.831
Little did I guess...

01:14:50.872 --> 01:14:52.739
... that he wouldn't provide a cure...

01:14:52.776 --> 01:14:54.769
Instead he trapped me on an island...

01:14:54.847 --> 01:14:57.876
... and forced me to make "Bird's Tongue" tea for him every day

01:14:59.656 --> 01:15:01.626
"Bird's Tongue" tea...

01:15:02.662 --> 01:15:04.792
Since "Bird's Tongue" tea is exclusive to the imperial court...

01:15:04.868 --> 01:15:06.770
... solely for the pleasure of the high-born...

01:15:06.771 --> 01:15:08.798
... Huo Yi wanted to put parasites in the tea, didn't he?

01:15:08.909 --> 01:15:11.642
Eunuch Lao from the Palace came to me for treatment

01:15:11.715 --> 01:15:13.685
He gave me a half-catty!

01:15:13.752 --> 01:15:14.685
Fetch it!

01:15:14.721 --> 01:15:16.691
Let's take a close look at it!

01:15:18.829 --> 01:15:20.799
IMPERIAL TRIBUTE TEA

01:15:38.870 --> 01:15:40.840
There are parasites in the tea!

01:15:41.776 --> 01:15:43.747
I'll check what kind they are

01:15:45.751 --> 01:15:47.914
It's a type of dung beetle!

01:15:48.691 --> 01:15:50.684
The rarest and weirdest of parasites!

01:15:50.795 --> 01:15:52.856
When the tea enters the body...

01:15:52.966 --> 01:15:54.799
... the first effect is to boost strength

01:15:54.803 --> 01:15:56.773
The person will feel very energetic

01:15:56.873 --> 01:15:58.843
But when infestation sets in...

01:15:58.844 --> 01:16:00.677
... death is certain

01:16:00.715 --> 01:16:01.945
Good parasites!

01:16:01.951 --> 01:16:03.921
Good parasites!

01:16:05.859 --> 01:16:07.829
This is an Imperial Tribute

01:16:08.732 --> 01:16:10.861
If all the nobles are taking this tea...

01:16:10.936 --> 01:16:12.929
... the imperial court is doomed!

01:16:13.942 --> 01:16:15.912
Even worse...

01:16:17.850 --> 01:16:19.820
... the Emperor!

01:16:30.877 --> 01:16:32.779
The Empress's deadline...

01:16:32.814 --> 01:16:34.784
... was already three days ago

01:16:35.787 --> 01:16:36.812
But the case...

01:16:36.855 --> 01:16:38.825
... remains unsolved

01:16:49.882 --> 01:16:52.979
BIRD'S TONGUE

01:17:14.867 --> 01:17:15.926
"The situation is grave"

01:17:15.935 --> 01:17:16.903
"A national disaster looms"

01:17:16.937 --> 01:17:17.905
"To keep this secret..."

01:17:17.906 --> 01:17:19.876
"... please meet me at the back door"

01:17:20.010 --> 01:17:21.809
"Dee"

01:17:21.814 --> 01:17:23.943
Dee!

01:17:39.049 --> 01:17:41.019
I'll see just how clever you are!

01:17:41.922 --> 01:17:43.892
- Sovle it?
- I have the clues to solve the case

01:17:43.959 --> 01:17:45.895
We face the death penalty!

01:17:45.930 --> 01:17:46.920
What's there to solve?

01:17:46.965 --> 01:17:48.936
I can convince Her Majesty

01:17:49.003 --> 01:17:50.870
Let me go to the Palace to see Her Majesty

01:17:50.907 --> 01:17:52.877
I'm sure I can get the deadline extended

01:17:53.913 --> 01:17:55.883
How could you convince her?

01:17:59.925 --> 01:18:00.824
Reporting to Your Majesty...

01:18:00.860 --> 01:18:01.828
The head of the Da Lisi...

01:18:01.829 --> 01:18:02.819
... Yuchi...

01:18:02.864 --> 01:18:04.834
... he wants to see you urgently

01:18:04.902 --> 01:18:06.872
Ridiculous!

01:18:06.872 --> 01:18:08.842
Where did this man come from?

01:18:08.910 --> 01:18:09.970
He is...

01:18:09.980 --> 01:18:11.950
... from the Da Lisi

01:18:12.050 --> 01:18:13.883
A new recruit

01:18:13.887 --> 01:18:14.912
The imperial court of Luoyang...

01:18:14.956 --> 01:18:16.049
... numbers more than 1,200 people

01:18:16.092 --> 01:18:18.062
Almost eveyone drinks "Bird's Tongue"

01:18:18.964 --> 01:18:19.954
If...

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:21.867
... everyone is infested by parasites...

01:18:21.870 --> 01:18:22.963
... then the plotters aim...

01:18:22.972 --> 01:18:26.035
... to murder the Imperial family and end our Great Tang Dynasty

01:18:27.047 --> 01:18:28.949
Your humble servant guesses...

01:18:28.951 --> 01:18:30.818
... that is indeed their intention

01:18:30.855 --> 01:18:31.881
Your humble servant...

01:18:31.924 --> 01:18:33.894
... also considers this guess to be absurd...

01:18:33.962 --> 01:18:34.930
... and incredible

01:18:34.930 --> 01:18:36.091
This is just talk!

01:18:36.099 --> 01:18:38.832
Even if your words are true...

01:18:38.905 --> 01:18:40.100
... the person of the Emperor...

01:18:40.141 --> 01:18:42.874
... is not available to the likes of you!

01:18:42.946 --> 01:18:44.916
He must be treated by the Imperial Doctor

01:18:44.950 --> 01:18:45.975
Your Majesty...

01:18:46.019 --> 01:18:47.989
Our nation faces disaster...

01:18:48.057 --> 01:18:50.028
If you hold to such formalities ...

01:18:50.028 --> 01:18:51.964
... nothing can save us

01:18:51.965 --> 01:18:53.935
What?

01:18:54.103 --> 01:18:56.870
Your humble servant has medicine to curb the parasites

01:18:56.942 --> 01:18:59.105
Please summon any official who drinks "Bird's Tongue" tea

01:18:59.180 --> 01:19:01.150
A test will be the proof

01:19:02.987 --> 01:19:04.114
Chief of Administration...

01:19:04.123 --> 01:19:06.924
Why am I summoned to the Palace in such haste?

01:19:07.062 --> 01:19:09.055
Has someone been examining my records?

01:19:09.901 --> 01:19:10.869
Father... Mother...

01:19:11.105 --> 01:19:13.871
Your son will finally fulfill your expectations!

01:19:13.944 --> 01:19:15.937
I will live up my name Yuanda: "Far and Wide"!

01:19:16.014 --> 01:19:17.039
Rise...

01:19:17.050 --> 01:19:19.020
Thank you, Your Majesty

01:19:19.054 --> 01:19:21.924
We summon you in the still of the starry night...

01:19:22.026 --> 01:19:23.085
... to ask whether or not...

01:19:23.129 --> 01:19:25.122
... you often drink "Bird's Tongue" tea

01:19:25.166 --> 01:19:26.931
I do!

01:19:26.970 --> 01:19:28.963
It strengthens the qi and the body

01:19:29.040 --> 01:19:31.010
I drink a pot every morning and evening

01:19:31.078 --> 01:19:31.977
Noble Sir...

01:19:31.980 --> 01:19:33.006
Please have this medicine soup for your health

01:19:33.049 --> 01:19:35.987
Medicinal soup for my health?

01:19:37.091 --> 01:19:39.061
What is it for?

01:19:39.162 --> 01:19:40.961
Minister Ding...

01:19:40.999 --> 01:19:42.935
Is it at every midnight...

01:19:42.936 --> 01:19:44.906
... that your stomach is upset?

01:19:45.040 --> 01:19:47.010
So that you need to take this tea...

01:19:47.044 --> 01:19:49.014
... to regain your strength?

01:19:49.015 --> 01:19:50.142
In response to Your Majesty...

01:19:50.184 --> 01:19:52.051
That is so

01:19:52.087 --> 01:19:53.147
But if I take more of the tea...

01:19:53.191 --> 01:19:55.184
... I always feel very much stronger

01:19:56.998 --> 01:19:58.991
Then please take this soup at once

01:19:59.069 --> 01:20:01.039
It's a test for the Emperor's medicine

01:20:01.106 --> 01:20:03.076
Your humble servant understands

01:20:09.156 --> 01:20:10.146
This taste...

01:20:10.158 --> 01:20:12.025
Why is it so fishy?

01:20:12.028 --> 01:20:12.996
Noble Sir...

01:20:13.030 --> 01:20:15.092
This is the secret family prescription of the Imperial Doctor

01:20:15.169 --> 01:20:17.970
One bowl will extend your life for a year

01:20:18.108 --> 01:20:22.948
I'm grateful for Her Majesty's generosity!

01:20:31.034 --> 01:20:33.129
Does this soup really prolong life

01:20:35.042 --> 01:20:37.013
It was obtained from the Administration office

01:20:37.014 --> 01:20:38.141
"Virgin Male Urine"

01:20:38.149 --> 01:20:40.119
Eunuch's urine!

01:20:40.988 --> 01:20:42.115
Absurd!

01:20:42.124 --> 01:20:44.094
You give my officials urine?

01:20:44.996 --> 01:20:47.057
It's been tested by Imperial Doctor Wang Pu

01:20:47.167 --> 01:20:49.137
The dung beetle parasites produce 'hot' poisons

01:20:49.171 --> 01:20:51.232
The antidote is a 'cool' medicinal soup

01:20:52.210 --> 01:20:54.146
The effect will be felt within two hours

01:20:54.181 --> 01:20:55.080
Very well...

01:20:55.083 --> 01:20:56.143
Guards!

01:20:56.153 --> 01:20:57.246
Detain him...

01:20:57.288 --> 01:20:59.155
After two hours...

01:20:59.159 --> 01:21:01.061
... if there's no effect on Minister Ding...

01:21:01.096 --> 01:21:03.066
... Dee will be executed forthwith!

01:21:03.133 --> 01:21:05.103
We obey!

01:21:06.073 --> 01:21:07.098
As for you...

01:21:07.141 --> 01:21:09.111
You'd be better watch Minister Ding

01:21:09.179 --> 01:21:11.172
If Dee was lying...

01:21:11.249 --> 01:21:13.014
... he will be punished

01:21:13.053 --> 01:21:15.023
And you will be imprisoned!

01:21:23.108 --> 01:21:24.269
Wang Pu...

01:21:24.310 --> 01:21:26.280
I devoutly wish that your remedy is effective!

01:21:33.194 --> 01:21:35.130
Minister Ding...

01:21:35.165 --> 01:21:37.135
Do you feel any change?

01:21:38.172 --> 01:21:40.108
Have a bowl of urine yourself

01:21:40.109 --> 01:21:42.079
Then you'll know what changes to expect!

01:21:48.225 --> 01:21:49.124
Your Majesty...

01:21:49.161 --> 01:21:50.129
The time is up

01:21:50.163 --> 01:21:52.133
Minister Ding reports no change

01:21:54.137 --> 01:21:56.039
Decapitate him!

01:21:56.075 --> 01:21:58.045
We obey!

01:22:14.112 --> 01:22:16.207
Withdraw the blade!

01:22:17.218 --> 01:22:19.051
I have Imperial Doctor Wang Pu's authority...

01:22:19.088 --> 01:22:20.284
... to beg Her Majesty for clemency!

01:22:20.325 --> 01:22:22.227
Please spare the life for Dee!

01:22:22.229 --> 01:22:24.062
Stop the execution!

01:22:24.099 --> 01:22:25.124
Intruder on the execution ground!

01:22:25.168 --> 01:22:27.104
Immediate death penalty!

01:22:27.105 --> 01:22:28.164
I am the Imperial Doctor's apprentice

01:22:28.174 --> 01:22:29.335
Shatuo

01:22:29.343 --> 01:22:32.110
I have my master's authority to plead for clemency

01:22:32.182 --> 01:22:34.118
Please wait for another hour or two

01:22:34.153 --> 01:22:35.314
The medicine wil surely take effect

01:22:35.321 --> 01:22:37.188
Your Majesty, please spare his life

01:22:37.225 --> 01:22:39.127
Ruiji, you should not be here

01:22:39.129 --> 01:22:40.325
Dee dares to take this risk...

01:22:40.332 --> 01:22:42.165
... because he wants to save the Emperor!

01:22:42.203 --> 01:22:44.230
It's the Courtesan of Luoyang

01:22:45.342 --> 01:22:47.209
It's the Courtesan of Luoyang

01:22:47.213 --> 01:22:49.183
Yin Ruiji

01:22:50.186 --> 01:22:51.154
Dee has found...

01:22:51.188 --> 01:22:52.349
... the cure for the Emperor

01:22:52.356 --> 01:22:54.326
Just wait an hour or two!

01:22:54.327 --> 01:22:56.126
Execute him now!

01:22:56.131 --> 01:22:57.121
If anyone delays further...

01:22:57.166 --> 01:22:58.259
.. they will die too!

01:22:58.302 --> 01:22:59.362
Execute him now!

01:22:59.371 --> 01:23:01.101
Withdraw the blade!

01:23:01.141 --> 01:23:01.403
Don't execute him!

01:23:01.409 --> 01:23:03.379
- No!
- Don't do it!

01:23:06.219 --> 01:23:08.314
"Raindrop drums"

01:23:09.291 --> 01:23:10.384
Your Majesty...

01:23:10.427 --> 01:23:13.331
Your Majesty, Yuchi is calling "Raindrop drums"!

01:23:13.399 --> 01:23:15.426
There's been a change in the Palace

01:23:16.239 --> 01:23:18.141
Your Majesty...

01:23:18.142 --> 01:23:20.112
Your Majesty...

01:23:21.182 --> 01:23:22.412
Stay the execution!

01:23:22.418 --> 01:23:25.151
Stay the execution at once!

01:23:32.205 --> 01:23:33.173
Ruiji...

01:23:33.173 --> 01:23:34.334
You shouldn't come to the Palace

01:23:34.342 --> 01:23:36.312
You can't stay here a minute longer!

01:23:36.346 --> 01:23:38.316
Leave at once!

01:23:38.450 --> 01:23:41.149
Shatuo, follow me inside!

01:23:41.323 --> 01:23:43.190
Step back!

01:23:43.227 --> 01:23:45.198
Step back!

01:23:45.198 --> 01:23:47.225
Her Majesty is here!

01:23:49.473 --> 01:23:51.272
Your Majesty

01:23:51.277 --> 01:23:53.247
Your Majesty, take care!

01:23:58.425 --> 01:24:00.395
Quick!

01:24:02.266 --> 01:24:03.360
Make way!

01:24:03.369 --> 01:24:04.267
Your Majesty...

01:24:04.304 --> 01:24:06.274
Dee is here

01:24:30.424 --> 01:24:32.394
Now the parasites have shown themselves...

01:24:32.428 --> 01:24:35.195
... the first priority is to treat the Emperor

01:24:40.444 --> 01:24:42.209
The "Golden Soup"

01:24:42.248 --> 01:24:44.218
Prepare His Majesty's mouth!

01:24:47.392 --> 01:24:49.328
Please order the Interior Ministry...

01:24:49.329 --> 01:24:51.299
... to provide more of the antidote

01:24:51.367 --> 01:24:52.392
Supply it to the Imperial family and the court

01:24:52.402 --> 01:24:53.301
In this way...

01:24:53.337 --> 01:24:54.396
... the villains' evil plan...

01:24:54.440 --> 01:24:56.376
... will be foiled

01:24:56.377 --> 01:24:58.347
Drink!

01:25:00.251 --> 01:25:02.221
Drink!

01:25:02.389 --> 01:25:04.359
Drink more!

01:25:06.297 --> 01:25:08.267
Drink it all!

01:25:10.339 --> 01:25:12.468
His Majesty generously provides...

01:25:12.543 --> 01:25:14.479
... all of us officials...

01:25:14.481 --> 01:25:17.317
... with this Imperial tonic

01:25:17.386 --> 01:25:18.547
Drink it!

01:25:18.555 --> 01:25:21.493
Your Majesty, thank you!

01:25:48.551 --> 01:25:50.521
(Dondo) Something's wrong!

01:26:50.410 --> 01:26:51.606
Dee...

01:26:51.646 --> 01:26:53.616
Your insights are matchless

01:26:53.650 --> 01:26:55.415
No one else can compare

01:26:55.454 --> 01:26:56.513
You dared to risk your own life...

01:26:56.556 --> 01:26:58.526
... to save our country from this peril

01:26:58.527 --> 01:27:00.588
No wonder Minister Yan so highly recommended you

01:27:01.399 --> 01:27:02.594
"Brightest Pearl of a River"

01:27:02.635 --> 01:27:04.605
"Priceless Treasure of the East"

01:27:05.441 --> 01:27:06.466
Your Majesty...

01:27:06.509 --> 01:27:08.479
The villains behind this are still at large

01:27:08.480 --> 01:27:09.642
The danger is stil present

01:27:09.683 --> 01:27:12.415
Sir, please extend the deadline for concluding the case

01:27:15.462 --> 01:27:16.487
Your Majesty...

01:27:16.497 --> 01:27:18.467
What Dee says is true

01:27:18.501 --> 01:27:19.594
Your Majesty, please show indulgence

01:27:19.603 --> 01:27:21.402
We will do our utmost...

01:27:21.440 --> 01:27:23.410
... to arrest the villains and mete out justice

01:27:28.688 --> 01:27:30.659
Dee, these are my orders

01:27:31.494 --> 01:27:33.522
I hereby appoint you as our Imperial Commissioner

01:27:33.632 --> 01:27:35.602
With absolute power over all other ranks

01:27:35.603 --> 01:27:37.573
Take charge of the Sea Dragon incident

01:27:40.646 --> 01:27:42.548
Your Majesy...

01:27:42.550 --> 01:27:44.611
Dee has been in the capital for only ten days

01:27:44.721 --> 01:27:46.486
He's not familiar with the place

01:27:46.525 --> 01:27:47.493
I'm afraid that...

01:27:47.493 --> 01:27:49.463
... he is incapable of discharging this mission

01:27:49.497 --> 01:27:50.693
Yuchi, this is my order

01:27:50.700 --> 01:27:52.670
You command the Da Lisi...

01:27:52.671 --> 01:27:54.504
... and our elite militia

01:27:54.542 --> 01:27:56.512
You are to follow the orders of Dee

01:27:56.512 --> 01:27:58.482
Work with him to solve the mystery

01:27:58.550 --> 01:28:00.520
I...

01:28:00.654 --> 01:28:02.624
I obey!

01:28:02.691 --> 01:28:03.716
Master Yuchi

01:28:03.726 --> 01:28:05.696
My congratulations, Master Yuchi!

01:28:05.730 --> 01:28:07.461
Mr Dee...

01:28:07.468 --> 01:28:08.697
You're such a hypocrite...

01:28:08.736 --> 01:28:10.501
... to congratulate me

01:28:10.540 --> 01:28:11.565
Of course I should

01:28:11.576 --> 01:28:13.546
You're about to achieve a great success

01:28:13.546 --> 01:28:15.517
The traitor who's been hiding within the Da Lisi...

01:28:15.551 --> 01:28:17.521
... will soon reveal his identity

01:28:21.730 --> 01:28:24.531
All men of the Da Lisi, these are my orders!

01:28:24.703 --> 01:28:26.468
Prepare your horses!

01:28:26.507 --> 01:28:27.736
Be ready to move!

01:28:27.742 --> 01:28:29.712
The cavalry guards will divide into eight teams

01:28:30.515 --> 01:28:31.676
Join the special force

01:28:31.717 --> 01:28:33.653
Searh for Dondoers in South City...

01:28:33.654 --> 01:28:35.556
... and arrest them for questioning!

01:28:35.592 --> 01:28:37.562
Yes, Sir!

01:28:38.765 --> 01:28:40.530
Sir...

01:28:40.536 --> 01:28:42.665
Since Master Yuchi signed the order to move the troops...

01:28:43.475 --> 01:28:44.534
... no one has seen him

01:28:44.577 --> 01:28:45.567
I know

01:28:45.612 --> 01:28:47.582
Make sure everyone is ready

01:28:48.585 --> 01:28:49.678
Yes, Sir!

01:28:49.687 --> 01:28:51.657
Sir!

01:29:03.649 --> 01:29:05.676
I've brought the joss stick you wanted

01:29:06.555 --> 01:29:08.525
Now, just wait and watch

01:29:11.665 --> 01:29:12.724
What's this all about?

01:29:12.734 --> 01:29:14.567
Choosing the moment to move out

01:29:14.571 --> 01:29:15.733
It's not the "right" moment yet

01:29:15.741 --> 01:29:17.711
We'll move out when the joss stick ends

01:29:18.680 --> 01:29:20.582
You believe in that stuff?

01:29:20.618 --> 01:29:22.588
The Da Lisi has sealed the city to seek out Dondoers

01:29:22.622 --> 01:29:23.681
The traitor needs to sneak out to warn them

01:29:23.690 --> 01:29:24.658
The joss stick...

01:29:24.659 --> 01:29:25.684
... gives him just enough time...

01:29:25.728 --> 01:29:27.698
... to try to do so

01:29:28.634 --> 01:29:31.663
BACKDOOR OF DA LISI

01:29:56.657 --> 01:29:58.719
So you're the traitor

01:29:59.630 --> 01:30:00.826
You guard the door every day

01:30:00.833 --> 01:30:03.566
So you know all our movements and activities

01:30:03.739 --> 01:30:05.800
But you've fallen into the trap I set for you

01:30:06.611 --> 01:30:08.581
"Luring a Snake from its Hole"

01:30:08.682 --> 01:30:10.652
I finally...

01:30:10.653 --> 01:30:12.680
... lured you out!

01:30:13.826 --> 01:30:15.819
I've been in the imperial court for many years

01:30:16.698 --> 01:30:18.668
But I have no prospects here

01:30:18.669 --> 01:30:20.639
I come from a poor family

01:30:20.774 --> 01:30:22.744
The Dondoers promissed to make me a Duke

01:30:22.878 --> 01:30:24.848
So I agreed to be their spy in the Da Lisi

01:30:25.617 --> 01:30:27.644
It's my only chance of becoming a nobleman

01:31:22.700 --> 01:31:23.862
Yuchi's horse went to the west

01:31:23.903 --> 01:31:25.873
He must be going to the river pier

01:31:27.911 --> 01:31:29.710
Go quickly to the Da Lisi

01:31:29.748 --> 01:31:30.738
Tell them to move to the pier

01:31:30.783 --> 01:31:32.753
Yes, Sir!

01:31:32.754 --> 01:31:34.724
(Dondo) Quick, back off!

01:31:36.795 --> 01:31:37.854
(Dondo) The Da Lisi is coming!

01:31:37.898 --> 01:31:39.868
(Dondo) Quick, back off!

01:33:48.966 --> 01:33:50.798
So the supremely skilled Dee...

01:33:50.802 --> 01:33:51.896
... is afraid of water!

01:33:51.939 --> 01:33:53.841
I'm not afraid of water

01:33:53.843 --> 01:33:55.813
I just can't swim

01:34:14.017 --> 01:34:15.987
That's the Sea Dragon which destroyed our warships

01:34:16.055 --> 01:34:18.025
What kind of monster is it?

01:34:30.952 --> 01:34:32.922
Sir

01:34:42.041 --> 01:34:42.974
Sir

01:34:43.010 --> 01:34:44.000
Are you all right?

01:34:44.012 --> 01:34:45.002
Throw in fish to lure the monster back

01:34:45.014 --> 01:34:45.982
Lure the monster back

01:34:46.016 --> 01:34:47.986
Yes, Sir!

01:35:13.072 --> 01:35:15.042
The monster has gone

01:35:16.144 --> 01:35:18.171
It seems to have gone with the Dondoers

01:35:20.186 --> 01:35:22.088
Judging by the direction they took...

01:35:22.123 --> 01:35:24.093
... they must be hiding on an island

01:35:24.194 --> 01:35:25.993
But looking at where our ships were attacked...

01:35:25.997 --> 01:35:27.864
... it could be any one of five small islands

01:35:27.901 --> 01:35:29.871
Which one is their hiding place?

01:35:31.209 --> 01:35:33.179
There's one more clue

01:35:36.085 --> 01:35:37.178
Mr Yuan

01:35:37.187 --> 01:35:39.157
You said that Huo Yi trapped you on an island

01:35:39.960 --> 01:35:41.019
Where was it?

01:35:41.062 --> 01:35:42.087
Where was it?

01:35:42.097 --> 01:35:43.087
I'm not sure

01:35:43.099 --> 01:35:46.162
They're raising a giant sea monster there

01:35:47.007 --> 01:35:48.168
One day...

01:35:48.176 --> 01:35:50.146
One of the guards was neglecting his duties

01:35:50.180 --> 01:35:52.116
So I opened the sluice gate...

01:35:52.152 --> 01:35:54.179
... and released the monster

01:35:54.991 --> 01:35:56.961
In the chaos, I got away

01:35:57.128 --> 01:35:58.187
How long...

01:35:58.197 --> 01:36:00.167
... did you swim for?

01:36:01.003 --> 01:36:02.973
The current flows east

01:36:03.007 --> 01:36:05.034
I followed it and swam as long as it takes a joss stick to burn

01:36:05.144 --> 01:36:06.169
When I saw a light ahead...

01:36:06.180 --> 01:36:08.150
... I swam towards it

01:36:08.217 --> 01:36:10.084
That's the direction of the Fuyu Kingdom

01:36:10.121 --> 01:36:12.091
The light was from their battleships

01:36:17.136 --> 01:36:19.106
It makes sense!

01:36:19.140 --> 01:36:20.939
The 'Sea Dragon' which sank our ships...

01:36:20.977 --> 01:36:22.947
... is the monster that Huo Yi raised

01:36:22.981 --> 01:36:24.244
Yuan Zhen set it free...

01:36:24.250 --> 01:36:26.220
... and it happened to run into our navy

01:36:27.022 --> 01:36:28.047
The duration of a joss stick...

01:36:28.058 --> 01:36:29.960
Current flowing east...

01:36:29.995 --> 01:36:31.156
On this evidence...

01:36:31.197 --> 01:36:33.225
... Huo Yi must be hiding on Bat Island

01:36:35.206 --> 01:36:36.174
The island is home to...

01:36:36.175 --> 01:36:38.042
... thousands of bats

01:36:38.045 --> 01:36:39.172
There are whirlpools offshore...

01:36:39.181 --> 01:36:40.149
... which wreck unwary ships

01:36:40.183 --> 01:36:41.982
A tiny population

01:36:42.020 --> 01:36:43.079
It's a natural fortress

01:36:43.089 --> 01:36:45.082
Just the hiding place for the Dondoers

01:36:46.095 --> 01:36:47.256
They have this monster

01:36:47.297 --> 01:36:49.267
If we head for Bat Island...

01:36:50.069 --> 01:36:52.164
... how can we deal with the monster?

01:36:52.274 --> 01:36:54.211
Sir...

01:36:54.212 --> 01:36:56.182
Please order the navy to stand by

01:36:56.283 --> 01:36:58.253
And buy up every fish in the markets

01:36:59.055 --> 01:37:01.025
Dead or alive

01:37:01.226 --> 01:37:03.196
Small fish to catch the big fish?

01:37:04.032 --> 01:37:05.261
How will you catch it?

01:37:05.267 --> 01:37:07.203
"Peacock Gallbladder"

01:37:07.238 --> 01:37:09.208
"Strychnine Pellets"

01:37:09.242 --> 01:37:11.212
Plus "Peacock Gallbladder"

01:37:11.212 --> 01:37:14.082
Maybe a little "Monks-hood Root" too?

01:37:14.286 --> 01:37:16.256
Why do you think it's your turn to speak?

01:37:17.159 --> 01:37:18.252
What are they talking about?

01:37:18.261 --> 01:37:19.229
Poisons

01:37:19.263 --> 01:37:21.130
Let's not waste time

01:37:21.167 --> 01:37:23.137
I'll start preparing them now

01:37:24.340 --> 01:37:26.071
Why are you standing there?

01:37:26.077 --> 01:37:27.045
Get to work!

01:37:27.045 --> 01:37:29.140
You're not as clever as him, so work harder!

01:37:30.318 --> 01:37:32.220
Four hours from now...

01:37:32.222 --> 01:37:34.192
... we'll meet at the shipyard

01:37:36.230 --> 01:37:38.201
Master Dee...

01:37:41.108 --> 01:37:42.076
Ruiji...

01:37:42.110 --> 01:37:44.046
Is she alright?

01:37:44.080 --> 01:37:46.050
Isn't she here?

01:37:46.284 --> 01:37:48.254
She went to find you at the execution ground...

01:37:48.322 --> 01:37:50.292
... and didn't come back

01:37:51.328 --> 01:37:53.161
Damn!

01:37:53.165 --> 01:37:55.135
I should have guessed

01:37:56.305 --> 01:37:59.071
Ruiji is descended from our enemies

01:37:59.311 --> 01:38:02.215
The law says she must be arrested

01:38:02.317 --> 01:38:04.082
As a bailiff...

01:38:04.088 --> 01:38:05.249
... you must value the law above your own life

01:38:05.290 --> 01:38:08.091
You won't beg for leniency, will you?

01:38:08.196 --> 01:38:10.166
Your Majesty, you're right

01:38:10.200 --> 01:38:12.170
I will not beg you to be lenient

01:38:12.371 --> 01:38:14.341
I am here to place a bet

01:38:14.375 --> 01:38:16.311
A bet?

01:38:16.312 --> 01:38:18.283
Where do you think you are?

01:38:18.350 --> 01:38:20.286
The Emperor suffered from the parasites...

01:38:20.288 --> 01:38:22.258
... and so did many members of the Imperial court

01:38:22.325 --> 01:38:24.261
Great Tang was nearly toppled

01:38:24.262 --> 01:38:26.232
The conspiracy was led by Huo Yi

01:38:26.233 --> 01:38:28.100
We must arrest him

01:38:28.104 --> 01:38:29.231
Or there will be more chaos

01:38:29.272 --> 01:38:30.297
I swear that...

01:38:30.341 --> 01:38:32.174
... I need just one day...

01:38:32.178 --> 01:38:33.339
... to arrest Huo Yi

01:38:33.380 --> 01:38:35.282
I will bet my life on it...

01:38:35.284 --> 01:38:37.220
... against Lady Ruiji's life

01:38:37.222 --> 01:38:39.192
One day...

01:38:39.226 --> 01:38:41.288
Aren't you a touch over-confident?

01:38:42.132 --> 01:38:43.226
If your humble servant fails...,

01:38:43.268 --> 01:38:45.101
... you will receive his head

01:38:45.105 --> 01:38:47.075
But if the matter can be resolved in time...

01:38:47.143 --> 01:38:48.270
I beg Your Majesty...

01:38:48.278 --> 01:38:50.111
... to release Lady Ruiji

01:38:50.115 --> 01:38:51.310
Your request is accepted

01:38:51.351 --> 01:38:53.218
But do not forget...

01:38:53.221 --> 01:38:55.123
In case of failure...

01:38:55.159 --> 01:38:56.388
... you will forfeit your life

01:38:56.394 --> 01:38:58.261
And the courtesan's head...

01:38:58.298 --> 01:39:01.099
... will also hang a top the city's walls

01:39:21.245 --> 01:39:22.270
Now...

01:39:22.315 --> 01:39:23.305
... don't be scared

01:39:23.350 --> 01:39:25.320
Remember my "Hold Your Breath" technique

01:39:28.160 --> 01:39:30.130
Dee...

01:39:30.197 --> 01:39:32.224
This is famous "Kun Steed" from Aizhou

01:39:32.335 --> 01:39:33.268
Not fast on land...

01:39:33.270 --> 01:39:35.172
... but matchless in water

01:39:35.207 --> 01:39:36.436
It can help you to fight

01:39:36.443 --> 01:39:38.310
Needless to say...

01:39:38.347 --> 01:39:39.406
... from now on...

01:39:39.449 --> 01:39:41.420
... you and I are even

01:39:43.190 --> 01:39:44.386
Set sail!

01:39:44.426 --> 01:39:46.225
To Bat Island!

01:39:46.230 --> 01:39:47.220
Let's see what's on Huo Yi's mind!

01:39:47.266 --> 01:39:49.236
Yes, Sir!

01:39:58.288 --> 01:39:59.381
Our distance from Bat Island...

01:39:59.423 --> 01:40:01.393
... is now twenty li

01:40:07.340 --> 01:40:08.399
All ships...

01:40:08.442 --> 01:40:10.412
Stop moving!

01:40:10.413 --> 01:40:11.346
All ships...

01:40:11.381 --> 01:40:13.351
Stop moving!

01:40:13.419 --> 01:40:15.184
Sirs...

01:40:15.222 --> 01:40:17.192
No movement in the water

01:40:21.234 --> 01:40:22.395
It's so calm

01:40:22.437 --> 01:40:24.304
Weird, though...

01:40:24.341 --> 01:40:26.208
They must be on Bat Island

01:40:26.244 --> 01:40:27.406
So they can see our approach

01:40:27.414 --> 01:40:29.350
We can't risk disembarking now

01:40:29.385 --> 01:40:31.287
I think we should retreat first

01:40:31.322 --> 01:40:33.224
Really?

01:40:33.226 --> 01:40:34.421
Retreat!

01:40:34.462 --> 01:40:35.487
Order...

01:40:35.530 --> 01:40:37.295
All ships to...

01:40:37.301 --> 01:40:38.394
... turn and withdraw

01:40:38.436 --> 01:40:39.461
All ships...

01:40:39.472 --> 01:40:41.442
Turn and withdraw!

01:40:41.442 --> 01:40:43.412
What's going on?

01:40:43.413 --> 01:40:45.246
Feint the east and attack the west

01:40:45.283 --> 01:40:47.253
You don't know that strategy?

01:40:53.467 --> 01:40:56.337
Dee bet his own life for yours

01:40:56.473 --> 01:40:58.443
What is your relationship with Dee?

01:40:59.312 --> 01:41:01.282
Circumstances made us friends

01:41:03.421 --> 01:41:05.449
Circumstances...

01:41:06.293 --> 01:41:08.229
A young woman who looks like you do...

01:41:08.264 --> 01:41:10.326
... can never be just a 'friend' with a man

01:41:10.436 --> 01:41:12.463
You should know this very well

01:41:14.544 --> 01:41:16.537
Since the two countries are at war...

01:41:17.349 --> 01:41:18.282
... the law says...

01:41:18.318 --> 01:41:20.345
... you should be arrested and interrogated

01:41:20.489 --> 01:41:22.459
If you remain alive...

01:41:22.526 --> 01:41:24.496
you'll harm Great Tang

01:41:24.565 --> 01:41:26.535
Detain her!

01:41:27.336 --> 01:41:29.306
I'm waiting for Dee to fail

01:41:29.374 --> 01:41:30.399
When that happens...

01:41:30.410 --> 01:41:31.435
... I'll see if your severed head...

01:41:31.479 --> 01:41:34.349
... still draws thousands of admirers!

01:41:54.325 --> 01:41:57.388
(Dondo) Da Lisi has found our hiding place

01:41:57.532 --> 01:41:59.525
(Dondo) We have to retreat before dawn

01:42:00.371 --> 01:42:01.396
(Dondo) Burn them quickly!

01:42:01.406 --> 01:42:02.396
(Dondo) Burn all the herbs and flowers!

01:42:02.441 --> 01:42:04.343
(Dondo) Don't delay!

01:42:04.379 --> 01:42:06.349
(Dondo) Yes, Sir!

01:42:13.598 --> 01:42:15.363
(Dondo) Da Lisi...

01:42:15.368 --> 01:42:17.338
(Dondo) Their ships have pulled back

01:42:19.410 --> 01:42:21.346
(Dondo) It seems...

01:42:21.380 --> 01:42:23.407
(Dondo) ... the "Sea God" must have scared them off

01:42:23.551 --> 01:42:25.384
(Dondo) But we can't find the "Sea God" either

01:42:25.422 --> 01:42:26.447
(Dondo) What shall we do?

01:42:26.457 --> 01:42:27.516
(Dondo) Once we've retreated...

01:42:27.559 --> 01:42:29.358
(Dondo) ... send reinforvements...

01:42:29.396 --> 01:42:31.560
(Dondo) ... to search for the "Sea God"

01:42:32.370 --> 01:42:34.340
Don't waste your efforts!

01:42:36.645 --> 01:42:38.615
The Da Lisi has Bat Island surrounded

01:42:39.451 --> 01:42:41.421
We kept our distance in daylight...

01:42:41.455 --> 01:42:43.618
... to make your defenses less alert

01:42:44.628 --> 01:42:46.598
You're so experienced...

01:42:47.367 --> 01:42:48.596
... but we've outwitted you

01:42:48.637 --> 01:42:50.401
Shatuo!

01:42:50.607 --> 01:42:51.575
Snake herbs. Wolf flowers

01:42:51.609 --> 01:42:53.579
The plants all secrete rare poisons

01:42:55.684 --> 01:42:57.654
(Dondo) The one with a mustache...

01:42:58.456 --> 01:43:00.426
(Dondo) ... is Dee

01:43:07.408 --> 01:43:09.378
So you're the universally loathed...

01:43:09.445 --> 01:43:10.607
Dee!

01:43:10.648 --> 01:43:12.446
Yuchi...

01:43:12.451 --> 01:43:14.422
When I last faced you...

01:43:14.456 --> 01:43:16.449
... I saw your shortcomings

01:43:16.593 --> 01:43:17.652
It seems...

01:43:17.662 --> 01:43:20.566
... Dee will soon have your post

01:43:23.407 --> 01:43:24.636
You blatant thief!

01:43:24.676 --> 01:43:27.546
What makes you so hate our Great Tang?

01:43:27.649 --> 01:43:29.642
What's behind your dirty tricks?

01:43:30.521 --> 01:43:32.491
Dee has godlike foresight

01:43:32.560 --> 01:43:34.462
You don't need to ask me

01:43:34.497 --> 01:43:36.433
Sir...

01:43:36.434 --> 01:43:38.597
The Fuyu Kingdom has long fought sea battles with Great Tang

01:43:38.705 --> 01:43:39.673
Dondo...

01:43:39.707 --> 01:43:41.677
... sits between the two countries

01:43:41.711 --> 01:43:43.704
The islanders are fisherfolk

01:43:44.517 --> 01:43:45.610
The sea battles have affected them

01:43:45.652 --> 01:43:47.451
They've been driven into exile

01:43:47.490 --> 01:43:48.549
Huo Yi...

01:43:48.558 --> 01:43:50.494
Your country is vulnerable...

01:43:50.496 --> 01:43:52.557
You've been forced out of your home

01:43:53.502 --> 01:43:55.473
You came here for revenge

01:43:56.642 --> 01:43:58.612
Dee

01:43:58.646 --> 01:44:00.707
If only we weren't enemies!

01:44:01.552 --> 01:44:03.419
With your help...

01:44:03.456 --> 01:44:05.426
... the world would be ours!

01:44:05.627 --> 01:44:06.652
But...

01:44:06.662 --> 01:44:08.655
Revenge was not my only motive

01:44:09.601 --> 01:44:11.503
The Middle Kingdom...

01:44:11.539 --> 01:44:13.509
You people are getting lazy

01:44:13.509 --> 01:44:15.445
If we pander to your desires...

01:44:15.447 --> 01:44:16.609
... at the right time...

01:44:16.650 --> 01:44:18.643
... we can take over your empire!

01:44:19.622 --> 01:44:21.592
I want to rule an empire!

01:45:33.640 --> 01:45:34.630
Dee!

01:45:34.642 --> 01:45:36.612
You're under poison flowers!

01:46:41.679 --> 01:46:42.670
Sir! Sir!

01:46:42.715 --> 01:46:43.740
We can't let Huo Yi escape

01:46:43.784 --> 01:46:45.651
There must be a hiding place down there

01:46:45.654 --> 01:46:47.624
I'll go down to look!

01:47:39.798 --> 01:47:41.768
Let go!

01:47:41.802 --> 01:47:43.773
Let go!

01:51:14.070 --> 01:51:15.972
What did you see?

01:51:16.007 --> 01:51:17.168
This is a nursery for parasites!

01:51:17.209 --> 01:51:18.177
They're using human bodies...

01:51:18.178 --> 01:51:20.148
... to breed them

01:51:27.196 --> 01:51:29.895
So the parasites in the Imperial Tribute tea...

01:51:30.002 --> 01:51:32.098
... were bred in human bodies!

01:51:33.176 --> 01:51:36.171
This is the true face of Huo Yi's master plan

01:51:47.070 --> 01:51:49.906
Sir!

01:51:52.114 --> 01:51:54.085
Dee...

01:51:56.022 --> 01:51:58.151
There's something I've wanted to ask you:

01:51:59.028 --> 01:52:00.930
When you were a bailiff in Bing County...

01:52:00.966 --> 01:52:02.936
... why were you sent to prison?

01:52:03.972 --> 01:52:05.235
I reported corruption in Bing County

01:52:05.241 --> 01:52:07.211
My superior framed me and had me locked up

01:52:09.984 --> 01:52:12.011
I saw many crimes inside the prison

01:52:12.155 --> 01:52:14.217
I understood that truth must be fought for

01:52:15.061 --> 01:52:17.156
And that justice must be demanded

01:52:20.005 --> 01:52:21.998
So, why did you come to the Da Lisi?

01:52:23.144 --> 01:52:25.171
The Da Lisi maintains the Tang Dynasty's laws...

01:52:26.017 --> 01:52:27.007
That is the core of a just society

01:52:27.019 --> 01:52:27.987
If I'm set on defeating crime...

01:52:28.021 --> 01:52:29.182
... and attacking privilege...

01:52:29.223 --> 01:52:31.193
This is the best place to do it

01:52:32.029 --> 01:52:33.999
So, I'll take that as praise

01:52:38.242 --> 01:52:40.212
Well said!

01:52:41.048 --> 01:52:42.073
Dee...

01:52:42.083 --> 01:52:43.142
Our mission is complete

01:52:43.185 --> 01:52:45.155
And Lady Ruiji has been saved

01:52:45.223 --> 01:52:46.282
Why do you still look...

01:52:46.291 --> 01:52:48.261
... so worried?

01:52:49.130 --> 01:52:51.100
There's something in the water!

01:53:33.321 --> 01:53:35.291
Where are you going?

01:53:35.326 --> 01:53:38.092
Can't you see how strangely the sail moves?

01:53:38.231 --> 01:53:40.201
The sail...

01:54:24.192 --> 01:54:25.217
That monster...

01:54:25.227 --> 01:54:27.197
... is right under our ship

01:54:27.198 --> 01:54:28.188
Archers of Ship Two!

01:54:28.233 --> 01:54:29.166
Be ready!

01:54:29.169 --> 01:54:31.139
Yes, Sir!

01:54:33.310 --> 01:54:35.280
Load the crossbows!

01:54:37.251 --> 01:54:39.118
Look-outs, use the signal flags!

01:54:39.155 --> 01:54:39.383
Ship Three!

01:54:39.390 --> 01:54:40.289
Follow the signals!

01:54:40.325 --> 01:54:41.350
Stand by with the poisoned fish!

01:54:41.394 --> 01:54:43.364
Yes, Sir!

01:54:44.166 --> 01:54:45.225
The monster is here!

01:54:45.235 --> 01:54:46.168
Be ready!

01:54:46.204 --> 01:54:48.174
The toxic bait won't work immediately

01:54:48.274 --> 01:54:50.244
This is a timer

01:54:51.314 --> 01:54:53.216
To the monster, the ship's crew...

01:54:53.218 --> 01:54:55.211
is more interesting than the fish

01:54:55.355 --> 01:54:57.325
We must release the toxic fish at the right moment...

01:54:57.359 --> 01:54:59.329
... or all our efforts will come to nothing

01:55:01.200 --> 01:55:02.396
Prepare the toxic fish!

01:55:02.403 --> 01:55:03.371
It's quite a distance!

01:55:03.405 --> 01:55:05.204
Try to aim them accurately!

01:55:05.209 --> 01:55:06.199
All of you...

01:55:06.211 --> 01:55:07.179
Watch the signals...

01:55:07.213 --> 01:55:08.181
... and don't act rashly

01:55:08.215 --> 01:55:10.185
Yes, Sir!

01:56:08.472 --> 01:56:10.442
The monster is starboard!

01:56:18.492 --> 01:56:19.460
We didn't see any signals!

01:56:19.460 --> 01:56:21.430
We can't aim the toxic fish!

01:58:15.598 --> 01:58:16.531
Over here!

01:58:16.567 --> 01:58:18.332
Aim at the red flag!

01:58:18.371 --> 01:58:20.341
Release them!

01:58:37.443 --> 01:58:38.411
Sir!

01:58:38.445 --> 01:58:40.415
Look!

01:58:52.373 --> 01:58:54.343
Release them!

01:59:14.619 --> 01:59:16.486
The poison will take effect in a while

01:59:16.523 --> 01:59:18.493
The top priority is to evade the monster

02:00:34.549 --> 02:00:35.517
Sir!

02:00:35.551 --> 02:00:37.522
Look!

02:01:09.687 --> 02:01:10.712
Ku?ng, Qian Zhang!

02:01:10.723 --> 02:01:12.590
See who needs to be rescued!

02:01:12.627 --> 02:01:13.788
Yes, Sir

02:01:13.795 --> 02:01:15.766
Dee...

02:01:15.800 --> 02:01:17.736
What did you discover this time?

02:01:17.738 --> 02:01:20.608
That I absolutely must learn how to swim!

02:01:21.679 --> 02:01:23.581
TO work in my Da Lisi...

02:01:23.616 --> 02:01:25.586
... one must not be afaid of water

02:01:40.585 --> 02:01:41.644
Mandated by heaven...

02:01:41.653 --> 02:01:43.623
... His Majesty decrees that...

02:01:43.657 --> 02:01:45.718
... the Dondoers are in revolt

02:01:45.861 --> 02:01:47.831
Our brave and dutiful officials...

02:01:48.634 --> 02:01:50.604
... will quell the rebellion

02:01:50.638 --> 02:01:53.610
Yin Ruiji's death sentence is waived

02:01:53.777 --> 02:01:55.644
But Great Tang and the Fuyu Kingdom...

02:01:55.681 --> 02:01:56.809
... remain at war

02:01:56.818 --> 02:01:58.754
So she must be denied...

02:01:58.788 --> 02:02:00.655
... contact with the outside world...

02:02:00.659 --> 02:02:01.820
... and be confined to Swallowed House

02:02:01.861 --> 02:02:04.662
So be it!

02:02:28.749 --> 02:02:29.739
Report to the "Two Saints"

02:02:29.751 --> 02:02:31.584
Your divine mandate...

02:02:31.622 --> 02:02:32.817
... swept away all the demons

02:02:32.824 --> 02:02:34.760
The Da Lisi has dealt with the villains

02:02:34.795 --> 02:02:36.765
Huo Yi and his Dondoers...

02:02:36.765 --> 02:02:37.824
... have been brought to justice

02:02:37.867 --> 02:02:38.858
The "Sea Dragon" case...

02:02:38.904 --> 02:02:40.874
... is now concluded

02:02:41.776 --> 02:02:43.746
Officer Dee

02:02:45.651 --> 02:02:47.621
This is the "Dragon Taming Mace"...

02:02:47.788 --> 02:02:49.758
It is cast from meteorite metals

02:02:49.792 --> 02:02:51.659
Harder than any other metal or stone

02:02:51.696 --> 02:02:52.891
I hereby bestow this mace...

02:02:52.898 --> 02:02:54.868
... charging you with the elimination of all evils

02:02:54.902 --> 02:02:56.838
May you be the conscience of our nation

02:02:56.873 --> 02:02:58.775
And the upholder of law for the world

02:02:58.810 --> 02:03:00.746
Even I myself...

02:03:00.781 --> 02:03:02.648
... and my Imperial family...

02:03:02.651 --> 02:03:03.915
If we fail our people in any way...

02:03:03.921 --> 02:03:07.759
... this mace will admonish us

02:03:17.783 --> 02:03:19.650
Her Majesty is still watching you

02:03:19.653 --> 02:03:20.678
If you stay in Luoyang...

02:03:20.722 --> 02:03:21.884
... your life will be in danger

02:03:21.925 --> 02:03:23.861
In the boxes you'll find money for travelling

02:03:23.862 --> 02:03:25.832
You and Mr Yuan must leave Luoyang at once

02:03:51.853 --> 02:03:53.823
Officer Dee...

02:03:53.957 --> 02:03:55.984
Your Majesty, thank you for your kindness

02:03:57.965 --> 02:04:00.766
This is the story of the "Sea Dragon" case

02:04:00.937 --> 02:04:02.804
This strange case...

02:04:02.875 --> 02:04:03.866
... tied my own fate and that of Luoyang...

02:04:03.878 --> 02:04:05.848
... closely together

02:04:06.850 --> 02:04:07.977
Some years later...

02:04:07.986 --> 02:04:09.956
... the fate of the Tang Dynasty changed for the worse

02:04:10.791 --> 02:04:12.761
A complete reversal

02:04:13.731 --> 02:04:14.824
But...

02:04:14.833 --> 02:04:16.803
Those were all matters still to come

02:04:17.305 --> 02:04:23.430
