Go.

01:43.303 --> 01:44.904
Go.

02:27.347 --> 02:28.913
What did we do wrong?

02:28.948 --> 02:30.950
There might
have been a failsafe
for the security video.

02:30.985 --> 02:32.917
That, or we got
spotted by the gsa.

02:32.952 --> 02:35.355
You know, i still say
this is a big waste of time.

02:35.390 --> 02:36.521
Yeah?

02:36.556 --> 02:38.558
Well, the bottom line is we've
got to be better prepared.

02:38.593 --> 02:41.726
If this had been the
real deal and not just some

02:41.761 --> 02:46.566
cyber-simulation, we'd be
in eckhart's hands right now.

04:35.608 --> 04:36.774
You know what?

04:36.809 --> 04:38.811
I must be crazy,
because i thought you
guys asked me to come

04:38.846 --> 04:40.378
in here and give you a hand.

04:40.413 --> 04:43.216
But clearly, i'm the only
one doing any work around here.

04:43.251 --> 04:46.019
Okay, do you guys want to
break it up or do you want me to

04:46.054 --> 04:47.986
come in there
and pry you apart, huh?

04:48.021 --> 04:49.622
You can't stand to see
other people happy, huh?

04:50.023 --> 04:51.224
Oh, have a
little pity, honey.

04:51.259 --> 04:52.425
The guy's just jealous.

04:52.460 --> 04:53.992
Yeah.

04:54.027 --> 04:55.593
No, i didn't introduce the
two of you so i could sit here

04:55.628 --> 04:57.630
all night
and watch you stare longingly
into each other's eyes.

04:57.665 --> 04:59.597
Oh, it's so sad.

04:59.632 --> 05:03.636
You know,
i've got to tell you, ton',
the idea of you giving

05:03.671 --> 05:06.039
up cyber-crime and opening
up a coffee shop

05:06.074 --> 05:08.041
- a little hard to take.

05:08.441 --> 05:10.643
Well, it's not a coffee
shop, it's a coffee bar.

05:10.678 --> 05:12.845
Yeah,
and who says you're
the only one who gets

05:12.880 --> 05:14.412
to clean up his act?

05:14.447 --> 05:16.049
Yeah, well you didn't
know ton' back in the day.

05:16.084 --> 05:17.650
Well, that was then.

05:17.685 --> 05:19.252
This is now.

05:22.455 --> 05:24.422
Seven card stud, nines wild.

05:24.457 --> 05:26.459
King's pawn
to queen's pawn three.

05:26.494 --> 05:28.461
I'll bet five.

05:28.496 --> 05:30.028
Call.

05:30.063 --> 05:31.664
My knight takes your bishop.

05:31.699 --> 05:33.231
Damn it.

05:33.266 --> 05:35.268
And i've got four
aces and three wild nines.

05:35.303 --> 05:36.469
What?

05:36.869 --> 05:38.671
And...

05:38.706 --> 05:40.473
checkmate.

05:40.873 --> 05:42.840
How'd you do that?

05:42.875 --> 05:44.477
It's another example
of using your opponent's

05:44.877 --> 05:46.879
weaknesses against them.

05:46.914 --> 05:48.046
Please.

05:48.081 --> 05:50.483
We've been hearing
that since day one.

05:50.518 --> 05:51.649
No, no, i'm serious.

05:51.684 --> 05:54.687
In your case, your recklessness
leaves you wide open.

05:54.722 --> 05:57.690
You, you play so cautiously,
i read you like a book.

05:57.725 --> 06:03.296
Yeah, well you
know what i think?

06:03.331 --> 06:06.099
He cheats.

06:12.505 --> 06:15.708
You know, one of
you lovebirds want to give
me a hand here, please?

06:29.722 --> 06:32.125
Thanks.

06:32.525 --> 06:34.927
Time to go online.

06:45.338 --> 06:47.940
We've been talking the past
few months about sinister men

06:47.975 --> 06:50.543
and women chasing mysterious
men and women with miraculous

06:50.578 --> 06:52.545
abilities through the streets.

06:52.945 --> 06:54.947
Well, one of my regulars
called in to describe what might

06:54.982 --> 06:56.914
be the ring leader in all this.

06:56.949 --> 07:00.553
A white-haired
guy who seems to pop up
in a lot of these stories.

07:00.588 --> 07:03.356
Miss macevoy?

07:08.561 --> 07:10.963
Are you trying to figure
out where you went wrong?

07:11.364 --> 07:12.965
I figured a little study
of your playbook might give

07:13.000 --> 07:14.932
me a leg up next time.

07:14.967 --> 07:16.569
Understanding your opponent's
weaknesses is important

07:16.969 --> 07:18.971
for everything in life.

07:19.006 --> 07:21.739
So what are yours?

07:21.774 --> 07:24.577
None of your
damn business.

07:24.977 --> 07:27.780
So did you catch that thing
about eckhart on proxy blue?

07:28.181 --> 07:29.382
Uh huh.

07:29.782 --> 07:31.384
Do you think that's going
to cause us any trouble?

07:31.419 --> 07:32.950
I don't see how.

07:32.985 --> 07:34.987
Although it must be driving
eckhart up the wall.

07:38.991 --> 07:40.593
Yeah, checkmate.

07:40.628 --> 07:42.595
Checkmate.

07:50.603 --> 07:52.205
As long as proxy blue seemed
to be nothing more than a

07:52.605 --> 07:55.207
whining voice for the
paranoid lunatic fringe,

07:55.242 --> 07:58.928
it remained nothing
more than an annoyance.

07:58.963 --> 08:02.615
But to hear myself
described in such detaii...

08:02.650 --> 08:06.184
i completely understand, sir.

08:06.219 --> 08:09.021
We all know how difficult how
it is to do our jobs and still

08:09.056 --> 08:11.023
remain invisible
to society's radar.

08:11.058 --> 08:12.190
Leaks are inevitable.

08:12.225 --> 08:16.594
But this story
just won't go away.

08:16.629 --> 08:19.832
It's already been
picked up by one of the
electronic gossip boards.

08:20.233 --> 08:20.633
And it gets worse.

08:23.436 --> 08:27.039
These bruisers
look like feds armed with
some pretty exotic hardware.

08:27.074 --> 08:30.243
They show up in black vans,
do their jobs and disappear.

08:30.278 --> 08:33.846
Sometimes innocent bystanders
disappear with them.

08:34.246 --> 08:37.850
And the guy in charge
looks something like this.

08:37.885 --> 08:42.255
Oh, dear.

08:42.655 --> 08:45.458
Well, i hold myself
responsible for allowing this

08:45.493 --> 08:47.825
to reach crisis proportions.

08:47.860 --> 08:51.464
But unless we find a way to
take over control of proxy blue,

08:51.864 --> 08:56.234
this cartoon could
destroy everything.

08:56.269 --> 09:06.279
I might be able to help
you solve your problem, sir.

09:06.314 --> 09:08.681
So when do the rest
of us get to meet her?

09:08.716 --> 09:09.882
Soon.

09:10.283 --> 09:12.285
She's opening the
data dive this weekend.

09:12.320 --> 09:13.886
I guess you'll all be invited.

09:14.287 --> 09:17.455
Brennan
introduced you two?

09:17.490 --> 09:20.693
You know, i know where
you're going with this.

09:20.728 --> 09:23.060
I know all
about toni's past,

09:23.095 --> 09:24.697
but i also know that
she left it behind her.

09:25.097 --> 09:27.900
Just don't want you
getting into something that

09:27.935 --> 09:29.867
could hurt you down the road.

09:29.902 --> 09:32.305
You know,
coming from anybody
else, i'd resent that.

09:32.340 --> 09:35.908
But coming from you...

09:35.943 --> 09:38.711
i love it.

09:39.111 --> 09:42.715
Yeah, well,
i'm keeping my eye on you.

09:42.750 --> 09:45.918
Oh, that's toni.

09:46.319 --> 09:48.721
I'll take care
of these later.

09:48.756 --> 09:50.723
Yeah.

09:55.528 --> 09:56.729
Hey, jesse, what's up?

09:57.129 --> 09:59.096
Everybody's
just hanging out.

09:59.131 --> 10:02.700
Brennan's reading, shalimar
is cleaning up, and emma's...

10:02.735 --> 10:07.940
emma's playing
chess by herself and still
getting her ass kicked.

10:07.975 --> 10:10.743
I heard that.

10:11.143 --> 10:12.345
And me, i'm just having the
time of my life sitting here

10:12.380 --> 10:14.712
staring at you.

10:14.747 --> 10:17.515
Oh, you do know
how to sweet-talk a girl.

10:17.550 --> 10:21.153
And speaking of
staring, i just got those
shots i told you about.

10:21.554 --> 10:23.556
You interested in
seeing some pictures of me

10:23.956 --> 10:25.958
in some really sexy lingerie?

10:25.993 --> 10:27.560
Let me think about that.

10:27.960 --> 10:31.163
Only one of the reasons
i am crazy about you.

10:31.564 --> 10:34.767
You're never
at a loss for words.

10:40.373 --> 10:42.375
Speaking of chess, this
is what the well-dressed

10:42.410 --> 10:44.194
red queen is wearing.

10:44.229 --> 10:45.978
What do you think?

10:46.013 --> 10:47.580
Sweet.

10:47.980 --> 10:50.783
Just takes
a second to download.

11:01.994 --> 11:04.797
It's called social
engineering, mr eckhart.

11:04.832 --> 11:07.600
The process by which,
with a few simple cues,

11:07.635 --> 11:10.768
one manipulates a mark.

11:10.803 --> 11:14.206
The way a con-man ingratiates
himself with a victim.

11:14.241 --> 11:17.610
Grifters have been using
this technique for years.

11:18.010 --> 11:20.378
Political candidates, too.

11:20.413 --> 11:24.016
Multl-millionaire
plutocrat passes himself
off as a good old boy.

11:24.051 --> 11:28.020
Regardless of what the product
is, social engineering is

11:28.055 --> 11:30.423
just a matter of selling
the client what they

11:30.458 --> 11:32.790
think they already want.

11:32.825 --> 11:36.794
I propose we attack
the problem in two ways.

11:36.829 --> 11:40.433
I want proxy blue destroyed,
and i want to seamlessly

11:40.833 --> 11:42.835
replace her with
our own identical version.

11:43.235 --> 11:45.638
To tell our
version of the truth.

11:45.673 --> 11:47.239
Exactly.

11:47.640 --> 11:51.443
Can you do it?

11:51.478 --> 11:55.247
I guarantee it.

12:05.257 --> 12:06.859
You know that
red queen outfit?

12:06.894 --> 12:07.660
Uh huh.

12:08.060 --> 12:09.662
The one in the picture
that we downloaded?

12:10.062 --> 12:11.864
Well, i'm wearing
the matching thong.

12:11.899 --> 12:13.666
Talk about knowing
my weaknesses.

12:14.066 --> 12:16.068
Blech.

12:16.469 --> 12:18.471
You know, i really
don't need to hear this.

12:18.871 --> 12:20.472
This better be good.

12:20.507 --> 12:22.039
Oh, hey, thanks.

12:22.074 --> 12:24.076
Come on, bren, don't make
such a big deal out of this.

12:24.111 --> 12:26.078
Yeah, toni was just
so grateful you introduced us,

12:26.479 --> 12:28.045
she wanted to find
some way to pay you back.

12:28.080 --> 12:30.883
Do i look like the kind of
guy that needs to be set up?

12:30.918 --> 12:32.450
Do i?

12:32.485 --> 12:34.452
I mean, you set us up.

12:34.487 --> 12:36.489
It's not about
needing anything.

12:36.889 --> 12:39.692
It's about wanting your friends
to like your other friends.

12:39.727 --> 12:41.258
Okay, well you know, i've
got to be honest with you.

12:41.293 --> 12:43.696
I've never
been set up on a blind
date in my entire life.

12:43.731 --> 12:45.262
You're not the only one.

12:45.297 --> 12:47.264
That's why i wasn't so
keen on meeting you either.

12:47.299 --> 12:52.905
Kendra macevoy, this is jesse
kilmartin and brennan mulwray.

12:52.940 --> 12:54.106
Nice to meet you.

12:54.507 --> 12:56.073
Nice to meet you.

12:56.108 --> 12:58.511
Geez,
when are you going to
quit playing in cyberspace

12:58.546 --> 13:00.513
there, toni, and get
yourself a real job?

13:00.548 --> 13:02.079
Don't let
her fool you, bren,

13:02.114 --> 13:04.517
kendra knows her
way around a touch pad.

13:04.552 --> 13:06.118
Oh, is that so?

13:06.519 --> 13:08.320
I met toni working
at an ad agency.

13:08.355 --> 13:10.122
I didn't know
you were in advertising.

13:10.523 --> 13:12.089
Well, wait,
let me guess

13:12.124 --> 13:13.691
- what,
did you hack into
the phone system?

13:13.726 --> 13:16.128
I used their phones for a
couple long distance calls.

13:16.163 --> 13:18.496
Yeah, about fifty grand worth.

13:18.531 --> 13:21.333
Kendra tracked me down,
but instead of busting me,

13:21.368 --> 13:23.300
they made me a consultant.

13:23.335 --> 13:24.937
So i went straight by
showing them how to make

13:24.972 --> 13:27.339
their system uncrackable.

13:27.374 --> 13:29.358
You know what?

13:29.393 --> 13:31.343
I remember that.

13:31.744 --> 13:32.945
We thought
that you were going
to rat us all out.

13:32.980 --> 13:34.146
Oh, yeah,
like i'm a rat.

13:34.547 --> 13:35.748
More like a pussycat.

13:35.783 --> 13:37.314
Oh, see?

13:37.349 --> 13:39.351
At least somebody
understands me.

13:39.386 --> 13:40.518
Gag.

13:40.553 --> 13:42.154
Come on, let me
show you around.

13:45.758 --> 13:47.359
Are they always
like that?

13:47.394 --> 13:48.526
Yeah.

13:48.561 --> 13:49.762
You know, if i thought
i could make any money,

13:49.797 --> 13:51.328
i'd sell tickets.

13:51.363 --> 13:53.365
Hey, whoa, wait a minute,
you're in advertising.

13:53.400 --> 13:54.932
Oh, no.

13:54.967 --> 13:57.369
I've used my
new mutant abilities to
get a much better job.

14:03.375 --> 14:05.778
The girl and the computers
are not to be harmed.

14:36.208 --> 14:37.810
Toni!

14:38.611 --> 14:40.177
Hey. Hey,
come here. Come here.

14:40.212 --> 14:41.814
Where the hell do
you think they're going?

14:41.849 --> 14:42.980
They've got toni.

14:43.015 --> 14:44.181
Hey, hey,
hey listen to me.

14:44.216 --> 14:46.218
Maybe they got her and
maybe she set us up, alright?

14:46.619 --> 14:49.021
Either way, you're not going
anywhere until we figure it out.

14:49.421 --> 14:50.988
Stay here.

14:51.023 --> 14:53.826
Listen to me, jesse.

14:59.832 --> 15:01.033
Okay, so what's the plan?

15:01.068 --> 15:01.834
What plan?

15:02.234 --> 15:03.000
The plan.

15:03.035 --> 15:04.201
The plan to save toni.

15:04.236 --> 15:05.838
Well, right now i don't
see that happening.

15:05.873 --> 15:06.639
What?

15:07.039 --> 15:08.606
Well, there's too many
unknowns in the equation.

15:08.641 --> 15:10.242
I mean, first
of all, we don't know
where she really stood.

15:10.643 --> 15:11.644
Where she stood?

15:11.679 --> 15:12.610
You know what?

15:12.645 --> 15:13.846
I think i'll tell
you where she stood.

15:14.246 --> 15:15.447
She did not set us up.

15:15.848 --> 15:16.649
Well, you know that?

15:17.049 --> 15:17.815
Yes, i know that.

15:17.850 --> 15:19.051
No,
you don't know that.

15:20.252 --> 15:22.254
You said
yourself that she introduced
kendra to you as her friend.

15:22.289 --> 15:24.273
Now, second, even if she was
imprisoned against her will,

15:24.308 --> 15:26.258
how do we know that eckhart
hasn't managed to suborn her?

15:26.293 --> 15:27.477
Suborn her?

15:27.512 --> 15:28.626
Suborn, jesse.

15:28.661 --> 15:30.262
She may be lost to us.

15:30.663 --> 15:31.829
Hey, you guys.

15:31.864 --> 15:33.465
I can't say for sure,
but it looks like we might

15:33.500 --> 15:35.067
have a serious problem.

15:52.685 --> 16:03.095
And, yes, we're ten
years ahead of the curve.

16:03.130 --> 16:05.114
Hey.

16:05.149 --> 16:07.099
Ow.

16:07.499 --> 16:08.700
What the hell was that?

16:08.735 --> 16:09.902
A sub-dermal governor.

16:10.302 --> 16:12.670
To keep you in line.

16:12.705 --> 16:18.711
I thought you
were my friend, kendra.

16:18.746 --> 16:21.478
Friends don't
kidnap friends.

16:21.513 --> 16:24.717
Oh, it's just a
little social engineering.

16:25.117 --> 16:26.719
Call it whatever you want.

16:27.119 --> 16:30.722
Pretending to be something
you're not is lying in my book.

16:30.757 --> 16:34.326
The truth is miss macevoy saved
you from making the biggest

16:34.361 --> 16:36.694
mistake of your life.

16:36.729 --> 16:39.531
Separating you from
those outlaws was a favour

16:39.566 --> 16:43.135
you could never repay.

16:43.170 --> 16:44.702
Mason eckhart.

16:44.737 --> 16:46.704
I've heard
all about you.

16:46.739 --> 16:48.340
Yes, and i've
heard all about you.

16:48.741 --> 16:50.743
Miss macevoy tells me you're
the best computer cracker

16:50.778 --> 16:52.309
she's ever met.

16:52.344 --> 16:53.911
I don't flatter easily.

16:53.946 --> 16:56.348
Well, if anyone can
crack proxy blue, toni can, sir.

16:56.383 --> 16:58.751
Get her set up in the
technical analysis section.

16:59.151 --> 17:01.153
If she's as good
as you say she is,

17:01.188 --> 17:03.956
i expect results, and fast.

17:14.366 --> 17:15.968
It's a file
transfer protocol.

17:16.367 --> 17:19.570
A tools application that
somehow got inside our system.

17:19.606 --> 17:21.939
How'd it get in there?

17:21.973 --> 17:24.777
Well,
it looks like someone slipped
it in under a picture file.

17:29.982 --> 17:34.752
Toni sent
me a picture file.

17:34.787 --> 17:39.591
Well, then i'd have to say
that toni is trying to crack us.

17:42.394 --> 17:44.396
Well, didn't you say
she used to be a cyber-outlaw?

17:44.431 --> 17:45.998
Yeah, but she went
straight a long time ago.

17:46.398 --> 17:48.000
Then what's
she doing trying to get
inside our computers?

17:48.035 --> 17:50.002
Well, i thought you
said that we can't be cracked.

17:50.037 --> 17:54.406
Yeah, we have molecular
nano-electronics.

17:54.441 --> 17:55.973
So we're fine then?

17:56.008 --> 17:57.574
If she's half as good
as you say she is,

17:57.609 --> 18:00.412
i won't know for sure until
i run a complete diagnostic.

18:09.621 --> 18:12.024
I want to apologize for blowing
the chance to bring mulwray

18:12.059 --> 18:13.590
and kilmartin into custody.

18:13.625 --> 18:15.592
Their presence there
was a complete surprise.

18:15.627 --> 18:17.629
I'm just
grateful that you were
able to grab quintana.

18:17.664 --> 18:20.032
You know, i have
to say, miss macevoy,

18:20.432 --> 18:22.835
i find
this new look of yours
a nice change from...

18:22.870 --> 18:25.602
my former presentation?

18:25.637 --> 18:27.204
If i were
to offer an opinion,

18:27.239 --> 18:29.241
i'd suggest it's
a big improvement.

18:29.276 --> 18:31.208
Actually, sir,
this is my real look.

18:31.243 --> 18:34.847
I was afraid you wouldn't
take me seriously if

18:34.882 --> 18:36.814
i showed up looking like this.

18:36.849 --> 18:39.251
So i transformed
myself to convey the idea

18:39.651 --> 18:42.019
of no-nonsense seriousness.

18:42.054 --> 18:44.857
While i had
you undercover infiltrating
miss quintana's world,

18:44.892 --> 18:47.659
you were socially
engineering me?

18:47.694 --> 18:50.828
I guess you
could say that.

18:50.863 --> 18:53.665
I knew we'd work
together beautifully.

19:01.273 --> 19:02.840
Emma?

19:02.875 --> 19:04.041
So what's going on?

19:04.076 --> 19:06.478
Adam's doing a complete
scan of the entire system.

19:06.513 --> 19:07.679
And?

19:08.080 --> 19:10.883
And he's
pretty sure everything's
going to be okay.

19:10.918 --> 19:11.683
Good.

19:12.084 --> 19:12.885
But you never know.

19:13.285 --> 19:14.451
Yeah,
tell me about it.

19:14.486 --> 19:16.088
Toni had me completely
convinced that she was

19:16.123 --> 19:17.289
an upstanding citizen now.

19:17.689 --> 19:19.691
And really,
she was just using jesse
to get into our system.

19:20.092 --> 19:21.493
Maybe.

19:21.528 --> 19:22.860
Maybe not.

19:22.895 --> 19:24.461
What's that
supposed to mean?

19:24.496 --> 19:25.697
She slipped a mapping
application into the system

19:25.732 --> 19:27.264
via some hot pictures.

19:27.299 --> 19:28.866
Sounds kind of sneaky
and underhanded to me.

19:28.901 --> 19:30.868
Yeah,
but if all she wanted to
do was crack us, why would

19:30.903 --> 19:32.905
she go through
the whole thing of you
introducing her to jesse?

19:33.305 --> 19:36.073
Yeah,
i guess you got a point.

19:36.108 --> 19:38.110
She could have
just sent me the e-mail.

19:38.145 --> 19:39.676
Yeah.

19:39.711 --> 19:41.278
That still doesn't
let her off the hook.

19:41.313 --> 19:42.514
The fact remains she
invaded the system, period.

19:42.915 --> 19:44.516
Yeah, but you can't just
go ahead and assume that...

19:44.551 --> 19:46.118
wait, what,
are you defending her now?

19:46.153 --> 19:47.284
Come on, i know toni.

19:47.319 --> 19:48.921
We're both felons, remember?

19:48.956 --> 19:50.487
I understand.

19:50.522 --> 19:52.925
I just wonder what
this is doing to jesse.

20:00.532 --> 20:02.134
It's exactly what
i was afraid of.

20:02.534 --> 20:05.337
Toni's application
has invaded our
entire computer system.

20:05.372 --> 20:08.105
Well, that's
not a huge deal, right?

20:08.140 --> 20:10.943
Do a full diagnostic, scan
everything, clean the system.

20:10.978 --> 20:12.910
It's already underway.

20:12.945 --> 20:16.949
So why do you look
like your dog just died?

20:17.349 --> 20:18.951
The gsa
gets their hands on the
matching software in the

20:18.986 --> 20:24.922
but it'll act
like a homing beacon.

20:24.957 --> 20:27.359
Coffee house,
they can use satellite
technology to pinpoint

20:27.394 --> 20:29.326
our exact location.

20:29.361 --> 20:31.763
So they could be here
in a matter of minutes?

20:31.798 --> 20:34.131
And destroy everything
we've created.

20:34.166 --> 20:37.769
Well,
since they're not here
already, i think we have to

20:37.804 --> 20:41.373
assume that jesse was right
about toni and she's just an

20:41.408 --> 20:42.940
innocent victim in all this.

20:42.975 --> 20:45.377
Yeah, with the guts not to
save herself by telling the gsa

20:45.412 --> 20:47.344
about the application,
at least not yet.

20:47.379 --> 20:49.781
Not to say the
gsa won't find it soon
enough on their own.

20:49.816 --> 20:50.983
Yeah.

20:51.383 --> 20:53.785
We've got to get our hands on
that software before they do.

21:02.995 --> 21:04.596
I've brought you here to
do a complete and thorough

21:04.997 --> 21:07.799
inventory of every piece
of technology in this place.

21:07.834 --> 21:10.819
I want you to examine
and catalogue every machine,

21:10.854 --> 21:13.770
hard drive, software,
scanner and outport device.

21:13.805 --> 21:18.210
I want every file downloaded,
checked and double-checked.

21:18.245 --> 21:20.978
I'm not sure i
understand, miss macevoy.

21:21.013 --> 21:23.815
The gsa has got the most
advanced computer systems

21:23.850 --> 21:25.382
that money can buy.

21:25.417 --> 21:27.018
Why bother
with all this junk?

21:27.053 --> 21:28.620
Money can
buy an awful lot.

21:29.021 --> 21:33.825
But it can't buy a cracker's
instinctual grasp on cyberspace.

21:33.860 --> 21:38.630
There may be a lot of secrets
buried amongst this junk that

21:39.031 --> 21:42.234
might save us
decades of development.

21:44.236 --> 21:46.238
But i could be here for days.

21:46.638 --> 21:48.640
And what's
your point exactly?

21:59.851 --> 22:02.654
So how come
you never told me how much
sub-dermal governors itch?

22:03.055 --> 22:04.221
Toni?

22:04.256 --> 22:06.258
Got any
other girlfriends being
held prisoner by the gsa?

22:06.658 --> 22:07.859
Why did you do this?

22:08.260 --> 22:09.861
Oh, god, do you
really have to ask?

22:09.896 --> 22:11.863
I'm a cracker, for god's sake.

22:11.898 --> 22:13.465
Adam's pissed.

22:13.865 --> 22:15.867
So somebody found the file
transfer protocol, huh?

22:15.902 --> 22:17.434
Yeah.

22:17.469 --> 22:19.871
Well, i figured i'd be in and
out before anybody noticed.

22:19.906 --> 22:22.491
And then i got
busted by these creeps.

22:22.526 --> 22:25.077
What in the hell
were you thinking?

22:25.477 --> 22:27.479
Oh, jesse, it's like i said,
you know, i'm a cracker.

22:27.879 --> 22:29.481
It's like...

22:29.881 --> 22:31.083
it's like everest.

22:31.483 --> 22:32.684
You do it because it's there.

22:33.085 --> 22:35.052
How did you get to
a computer in genomex?

22:35.087 --> 22:38.490
Well, they're
having me work on a way
to take over proxy blue.

22:38.525 --> 22:41.893
Eckhart's so pissed off he's
having me create a facsimile to

22:41.928 --> 22:45.462
sell the gsa party line.

22:45.497 --> 22:48.665
And that's why kendra
pretended to be my friend,

22:48.700 --> 22:51.468
so she could drag me in
here to work for these creeps.

22:51.503 --> 22:53.905
Adam says we've got to get our
hands on the other end of the

22:53.940 --> 22:55.872
mapping software before they do.

22:55.907 --> 22:57.909
Or else eckhart will be
able to pinpoint our location

22:57.944 --> 22:59.511
and we're toast.

22:59.911 --> 23:02.113
Kendra's over at the data
dive starting an inventory.

23:02.148 --> 23:04.316
So unless it got fried
when brennan hit the system,

23:04.716 --> 23:05.917
they're going to find it soon.

23:05.952 --> 23:07.884
I'm really sorry, jesse.

23:07.919 --> 23:10.722
Look,
it's in a red microdrive.

23:10.757 --> 23:12.541
I've got to go.

23:12.576 --> 23:14.326
I've got company.

23:17.129 --> 23:19.531
Adam.

23:21.933 --> 23:23.935
You know,
i don't have to tell
you the kind of pressure

23:23.970 --> 23:25.502
i'm under
to deliver here.

23:25.537 --> 23:29.941
Am i crazy,
or are you trying to get
me to sympathize with you?

23:29.976 --> 23:31.943
Well, if i thought
it would work.

23:31.978 --> 23:33.145
Forget it, kendra.

23:33.545 --> 23:34.746
You played me like
a violin and i'm done.

23:35.147 --> 23:36.348
Alright, you know what?

23:36.748 --> 23:37.914
Forget about me.

23:37.949 --> 23:39.516
And think about
your own skin.

23:39.551 --> 23:41.118
Yeah, i'm working
as fast as i can.

23:41.153 --> 23:45.557
Oh, toni,
i read you like a book and i
know what you're capable of.

23:45.592 --> 23:51.563
Think about this as a career
opportunity for both of us.

23:51.963 --> 23:54.366
You really
mean that, don't you?

23:54.401 --> 23:55.932
Absolutely.

23:55.967 --> 23:58.335
Well, these machines of
yours are state of the art.

23:58.370 --> 24:02.374
If all i wanted to do was
crack supermarket product codes.

24:02.409 --> 24:04.393
Look, i need my machines.

24:04.428 --> 24:06.378
My database, my tools.

24:06.778 --> 24:10.382
What do you say you bring
me over to the data dive?

24:10.417 --> 24:13.585
I'll see what i can do.

24:19.991 --> 24:21.193
So toni's okay?

24:21.593 --> 24:23.995
Well, yeah,
i mean she seems fine.

24:24.396 --> 24:25.997
Yeah, well right
now we've got to focus on
retrieving the microdrive.

24:26.032 --> 24:27.599
Assuming that
it's still intact.

24:27.999 --> 24:29.601
Look, there's a fifty-fifty
chance that brennan's

24:31.203 --> 24:33.004
we could be talking about a wild
goose chase here for nothing.

24:33.039 --> 24:34.806
Yeah, and we could also be
talking about the other fifty -

24:34.841 --> 24:36.408
the scenario that
says that he didn't fry it

24:36.443 --> 24:38.009
- and our goose is cooked.

24:43.215 --> 24:45.617
Emma's afraid jesse's not
going to forgive himself for

24:45.652 --> 24:46.818
getting us into this.

24:48.420 --> 24:50.021
Come on, guys don't
walk around beating
themselves up like that.

24:50.422 --> 24:52.023
He'll be over
it before you know it.

24:52.424 --> 24:53.625
What a load
of macho crap.

24:53.660 --> 24:55.192
It's not macho crap.

24:55.227 --> 24:57.229
That's why girls like soap
operas and guys like boxing.

24:57.264 --> 24:58.795
Oh, please.

24:58.830 --> 25:00.832
Oh, come on,
in soap opera it takes
a year to tell fifteen

25:00.867 --> 25:01.998
minutes of drama.

25:02.033 --> 25:03.600
In the ring it's over
in fifteen seconds.

25:03.635 --> 25:05.637
I hope that's not your
philosophy for everything.

25:13.245 --> 25:15.247
Hey, adam,
it seems like everybody
went home for the night.

25:15.282 --> 25:17.214
Brennan's right.

25:17.249 --> 25:19.216
I don't hear
anybody inside.

25:19.251 --> 25:20.852
Alright, then it's
a simple matter.

25:21.253 --> 25:24.055
You go in, grab the microdrive
and get out of there.

25:43.675 --> 25:46.077
Adam,
everything's gone.

25:50.081 --> 25:52.484
The only thing left
is an espresso maker.

25:54.886 --> 25:57.689
Then they've
taken everything over
to genomex for an inventory.

25:57.724 --> 26:02.494
And the gsa is one step
closer to finding our sanctuary.

26:15.774 --> 26:17.776
All right, brennan, right
now there are two possibilities.

26:18.176 --> 26:19.778
Either you accidentally
fried the mapping software

26:19.813 --> 26:21.344
in the first place.

26:21.379 --> 26:23.381
Or the gsa has it and
they don't know they have it.

26:23.782 --> 26:24.948
Exactly.

26:24.983 --> 26:26.550
Great, so we're right
back where we started.

26:26.585 --> 26:28.987
Only now we have to break
into the gsa to get the software

26:29.022 --> 26:30.589
and rescue toni.

26:30.989 --> 26:33.391
It's a good
thing i've got a little
experience in breaking in.

26:33.426 --> 26:35.794
Yeah, but after our failures
with the virtual break-ins,

26:35.829 --> 26:37.395
we have to totally
rethink our strategy.

26:37.796 --> 26:38.962
Yeah, really.

26:38.997 --> 26:40.599
If there's one thing we learned
from that damn exercise it's

26:40.634 --> 26:42.165
that just barging
in isn't going to work.

26:42.200 --> 26:44.002
Plus, we've got to make sure
that eckhart doesn't know that

26:44.037 --> 26:45.804
we're after the microdrive
in case we get in there and we

26:45.839 --> 26:47.370
can't find it.

26:47.405 --> 26:51.409
Man, you know,
i knew i shouldn't have
introduced jesse to toni.

26:56.615 --> 26:58.617
Now that we've got
all of your stuff here,

26:58.652 --> 27:01.785
could we pick it up a little?

27:01.820 --> 27:03.822
I just kind of figured
you'd bring me to the data dive

27:04.222 --> 27:06.625
instead of bringing
the data dive here.

27:07.025 --> 27:09.392
Get real.

27:09.427 --> 27:12.230
I bent over backwards
to make sure that all of

27:12.631 --> 27:14.833
your machines were here.

27:14.868 --> 27:17.000
And i expect results.

27:17.035 --> 27:20.638
I couldn't have put it
better myself, miss macevoy.

27:20.673 --> 27:24.207
The media seem to be unwilling
to let this story die.

27:24.242 --> 27:28.647
Everywhere i turn, i hear about
super-powered freaks pursued

27:29.047 --> 27:32.651
by brutish thugs lead
by a white-haired gentleman

27:33.051 --> 27:35.418
who looks like me.

27:35.453 --> 27:37.856
It's all
hitting a little
too close to home.

27:38.256 --> 27:41.059
Maybe it's time to go
public and cut your losses.

27:44.262 --> 27:46.264
Or maybe not.

27:50.268 --> 27:52.671
We're making serious
progress here, mr eckhart.

27:52.706 --> 27:54.638
And i am quite serious.

27:54.673 --> 27:57.475
I expect to
see a concrete example
of the new version of

27:57.510 --> 28:02.280
proxy blue by tomorrow
at the very latest.

28:02.315 --> 28:04.282
We'll be ready.

28:09.888 --> 28:13.691
If you really
think i'll be ready by
tomorrow, you're dreaming.

28:13.726 --> 28:17.495
And if you think that you're
going to be alive the day after

28:17.530 --> 28:19.497
tomorrow, oh, unless
you give me something,

28:19.532 --> 28:22.300
your nightmare's just begun.

28:41.119 --> 28:43.521
I wouldn't waste your time
watching me if i were you.

28:53.131 --> 28:54.332
I don't know.

28:54.367 --> 28:55.498
Maybe...

28:55.533 --> 28:57.535
well, if she's
eckhart's prisoner,
we should have her crack

28:58.336 --> 29:00.338
the genomex computerystem
and have her cause them as much

29:00.373 --> 29:01.940
aggravation
as she's caused us.

29:01.975 --> 29:03.541
You know,
it is a thought.

29:03.942 --> 29:06.344
Eckhart's got
her working on cracking
proxy blue's firewalls

29:06.745 --> 29:08.346
so they can create
their own version.

29:13.952 --> 29:15.954
I just passed checked
checkpoint five, adam,

29:15.989 --> 29:17.956
halfway across
the upper catwalk.

29:25.163 --> 29:27.130
What does the situation
look like from your end?

29:27.165 --> 29:29.167
I'm getting an all-clear
reading on the lower catwalk.

29:29.202 --> 29:30.385
Security's on yellow.

29:30.420 --> 29:31.534
Alert status: Zero.

29:31.569 --> 29:33.571
With no gs agents or
security officers between you

29:33.972 --> 29:35.373
and the tech lab.

29:35.408 --> 29:36.740
I'm on my way.

29:36.775 --> 29:38.376
Jesse, i've got
the all clear from adam.

29:51.589 --> 29:53.957
Take position, emma.

29:53.992 --> 29:55.994
We're all ready
to move on your signal.

29:56.029 --> 30:10.373
Go.

30:10.408 --> 30:12.010
Shalimar.

30:35.233 --> 30:38.436
What did we
do wrong this time?

30:38.471 --> 30:40.403
I don't know.

30:40.438 --> 30:41.604
Any number of things.

30:41.639 --> 30:43.606
Motion detectors i wasn't
aware of, hidden cameras.

30:43.641 --> 30:47.245
All i know is we better come
up with a better game plan or

30:47.280 --> 30:51.649
else toni's doomed
and we're finished.

31:18.142 --> 31:20.144
What are you doing?

31:20.179 --> 31:21.311
Oh, i was...

31:21.346 --> 31:23.713
i was just stretching my legs.

31:23.748 --> 31:26.150
We seem to make
miss quintana nervous.

31:26.185 --> 31:28.518
What have you
got to show us, toni?

31:28.553 --> 31:31.756
You know, i still
need a little more time.

31:40.164 --> 31:43.367
You could have a beautiful
future working for us here.

31:43.402 --> 31:46.571
Or that future could be short,
swift and brutally final.

31:46.971 --> 31:48.973
It's up to you.

32:12.997 --> 32:15.365
We're still playing virtual
games here while toni's

32:15.400 --> 32:17.402
we are all
frustrated, jesse, but
that doesn't mean we can

32:17.437 --> 32:18.603
go in with
our eyes closed.

32:18.638 --> 32:19.769
Toni is not a hero.

32:19.804 --> 32:21.371
We have to get
in there and get her out.

32:21.406 --> 32:23.007
Yes,
but like adam says, now that
we know going in soft and

32:23.408 --> 32:25.009
sneaky without being
ready to kick serious ass

32:25.044 --> 32:26.611
isn't the answer either.

32:26.646 --> 32:27.777
Adam?

32:27.812 --> 32:29.379
Hey, hey, hey.
Hold on, you two.

32:29.414 --> 32:32.617
Now, what we've got to do is
we've got to find a whole new

32:32.652 --> 32:36.038
way of thinking about
how to invade eckhart's world.

32:36.073 --> 32:39.389
Now, their greatest
weakness is eckhart's bullying

32:39.424 --> 32:43.027
shalimar's recklessness playing
poker, what we're talking

32:43.062 --> 32:49.434
about is using the gsa's
vulnerability against them.

32:49.469 --> 32:53.002
Assumption that
might makes right.

32:53.037 --> 32:57.041
When in fact might in
their case means arrogance,

32:57.076 --> 32:59.409
overconfidence and smugness.

32:59.444 --> 33:03.448
So we're going to use their
weakness as our secret weapon.

33:06.250 --> 33:09.854
This is proxy blue's take
on our round-up last week.

33:09.889 --> 33:11.873
Remember when
you thought justice,

33:11.908 --> 33:13.858
freedom and
due process were real?

33:14.258 --> 33:16.660
The family of five that
disappeared from their home last

33:16.695 --> 33:19.063
week must have learned those
ideals were just illusions.

33:19.464 --> 33:21.431
And this is ours.

33:21.466 --> 33:24.268
We've all been left in the
lurch at one time or other.

33:24.669 --> 33:27.472
But those people who took
off last week definitely had

33:27.507 --> 33:29.073
something to hide.

33:29.474 --> 33:32.642
Same story with an
entirely different spin.

33:32.677 --> 33:35.880
I love the fact that it
subtly blames the victim.

33:36.280 --> 33:38.648
I thought you
might like that, sir.

33:38.683 --> 33:40.650
And while the original
encourages skepticism,

33:40.685 --> 33:43.888
ours raises doubts about
the meaning of reality itself.

33:43.923 --> 33:47.091
Just another kind
of social engineering.

33:47.126 --> 33:50.259
Nicely done, miss macevoy.

33:50.294 --> 33:53.498
And we owe all this
to miss quintana here.

33:53.533 --> 33:56.300
Absolutely, mr eckhart.

33:56.701 --> 33:58.302
I told you she was a genius.

33:58.337 --> 33:59.103
For what?

34:03.508 --> 34:05.875
Adam.

34:05.910 --> 34:10.279
I owe
you an apology.

34:10.313 --> 34:12.917
Well, i've been acting like
toni's a victim in all this.

34:12.952 --> 34:15.520
But i have
to face the fact that
she's the one who got us

34:15.554 --> 34:17.121
into all this hot water
in the first place.

34:17.522 --> 34:18.688
Right.

34:18.723 --> 34:20.725
And i have to say that
i regret that we didn't try

34:21.125 --> 34:22.692
to rescue her sooner.

34:22.726 --> 34:24.328
You know, right after
she got incarcerated,

34:24.362 --> 34:25.929
and dealt with
the other problems later.

34:25.965 --> 34:27.130
Thank you.

34:27.532 --> 34:29.132
But she owes
us an apology,

34:29.534 --> 34:31.536
too, for trying
to crack our system.

34:31.936 --> 34:33.101
Hey, adam.

34:33.137 --> 34:35.940
I've got a really weird
proxy blue thing over here.

34:40.745 --> 34:44.348
So the truth is out, and
i'm not angry, i'm just hurt.

34:44.748 --> 34:47.952
The loser who called in
the story on this white-haired

34:48.351 --> 34:50.353
mastermind turns out
to be a hopeless dope fiend.

34:50.389 --> 34:52.722
Just the right tone.

34:52.757 --> 34:55.560
Who really owns your thoughts,
your feelings, your ideas?

34:55.594 --> 34:58.763
Reality is yours
to make, so make it right.

34:59.163 --> 35:02.366
It's a little
snide, a bit snarky,

35:02.767 --> 35:05.134
but with our
spin on reality.

35:05.169 --> 35:08.337
So, now we have our
perfect replacement.

35:08.372 --> 35:11.775
When is this little genius of
yours going to find the real

35:11.810 --> 35:15.179
thing so we can put an end to
this problem once and for all?

35:15.580 --> 35:17.181
We'll get
to that eventually.

35:17.582 --> 35:19.984
Eventually?

35:20.384 --> 35:22.787
I'll have toni work
on it until we find the
real proxy blue website.

35:23.187 --> 35:25.990
But meanwhile,
we don't have to wait.

35:26.390 --> 35:29.994
Toni's programmed
our version of proxy blue
to function as a virus.

35:30.029 --> 35:33.197
Who really owns your thoughts,
your feelings, your ideas?

35:33.232 --> 35:37.201
Our version hunts
down the real one.

35:37.236 --> 35:39.203
Reality is yours to make.

35:39.604 --> 35:41.571
So make it right.

35:41.606 --> 35:45.174
Eats it, and then
replaces it with itself.

35:45.209 --> 35:48.412
It's always seemed to me
the best way to get ahead is to

35:48.447 --> 35:50.014
know your opponent's weaknesses.

35:50.414 --> 35:53.583
So, even if they
turn on the real thing,

35:53.618 --> 35:56.420
they end up getting
our version of the story.

35:56.821 --> 36:02.827
And that's
how you get the masses to
buy the truth as we see it.

36:10.835 --> 36:12.837
It's always seemed to me the
best way to get ahead is to

36:13.237 --> 36:14.804
know your opponent's weaknesses.

36:14.839 --> 36:17.241
And the only way to take the
red queen is to move against

36:17.276 --> 36:18.808
black queen's ten.

36:18.843 --> 36:20.810
Would you play
it again, please?

36:20.845 --> 36:24.849
It's always seemed to
me the best way to get ahead

36:24.884 --> 36:27.652
is to know your
opponent's weaknesses.

36:27.687 --> 36:30.019
Where have i
heard that before?

36:30.054 --> 36:32.456
And the only way to take
the red queen is to move against

36:32.857 --> 36:34.423
black queen's ten.

36:34.458 --> 36:37.261
You know, toni calls
herself my red queen.

36:37.296 --> 36:40.029
And kendra was dressed
in black that night.

36:40.064 --> 36:44.468
Okay, but there are only eight
squares across a chess board.

36:44.869 --> 36:48.072
So what does
black queen's ten mean?

36:48.107 --> 36:51.275
Black queen's ten,
black queen's...

36:51.310 --> 36:53.242
ten.

36:53.277 --> 36:56.080
Well, the security forces
at genomex change shifts

36:56.115 --> 36:58.047
every day at ten o'clock.

36:58.082 --> 37:00.084
Maybe she's trying to tell
us that that's the best time

37:00.119 --> 37:01.651
to make our move.

37:01.686 --> 37:04.488
In other words, toni's using
the fake proxy blue that she

37:04.523 --> 37:08.492
created for eckhart
to send us a message.

37:08.527 --> 37:11.260
Yeah.

37:11.295 --> 37:17.101
Othere's always the possibility
us alof walking into a trap.

37:17.136 --> 37:21.623
But it's not like we have
a lot of choice in the matter.

37:21.658 --> 37:26.286
No, we're going in to genomex,
because whatever the danger

37:26.321 --> 37:30.915
that awaits us there, the
greater danger is the risk of

37:30.950 --> 37:33.282
compromising our
sanctuary's location.

37:33.317 --> 37:37.321
And that's something we
must never allow to happen.

37:48.799 --> 37:50.001
Black queen's ten.

37:50.401 --> 37:52.403
You know what to do.

38:10.821 --> 38:12.023
Go.

38:24.835 --> 38:26.037
Go.

38:40.451 --> 38:41.652
Go.

38:51.662 --> 38:54.065
Go.

38:56.067 --> 38:59.270
Kendra, you know, you ran
off so quickly the other night,

38:59.305 --> 39:04.440
i didn't even get
a chance for a goodbye kiss.

39:04.475 --> 39:08.479
Unfortunately,
i don't think there's
going to be a second date.

39:17.688 --> 39:20.056
Oh, my god.

39:20.091 --> 39:22.493
Miss macevoy,
i found something.

39:54.925 --> 39:56.927
Here, jesse.

39:58.529 --> 40:00.531
You know how to make
one hell of an entrance.

40:00.566 --> 40:02.133
You got my message, huh?

40:02.168 --> 40:03.334
Yeah.

40:03.734 --> 40:04.935
Jesse?

40:04.970 --> 40:06.102
Yeah?

40:06.137 --> 40:07.303
Grab the microdrive.

40:07.338 --> 40:09.740
I'm going to send eckhart
a little message of my own.

40:16.547 --> 40:18.549
Well, i've checked out the
system and toni's made sure that

40:18.584 --> 40:22.153
what she pulled
won't ever happen again.

40:22.553 --> 40:24.755
And now that i know how skilled
she is, i've asked her to do

40:24.790 --> 40:26.957
a security clearance for every
safehouse across the country.

40:26.992 --> 40:28.959
You're putting her
into the underground?

40:29.360 --> 40:31.161
Well, yeah, but rather
than get her out of town

40:31.196 --> 40:32.963
permanently, we're going
to keep her moving around,

40:32.998 --> 40:34.965
you know, to hide
her in plain sight.

40:35.000 --> 40:36.784
Right?

40:36.819 --> 40:38.569
Right.

40:42.573 --> 40:44.575
So you and i can get
together for some hot weekends

40:44.610 --> 40:47.378
in spas across the country.

40:47.413 --> 40:49.380
Alright.

40:52.983 --> 40:54.985
Ah. Now, if only she can strike
that happy balance between

40:55.020 --> 40:58.589
creative curiosity
and criminal trespass.

41:06.197 --> 41:11.402
It speaks ill of a number two
to allow an invasion of this

41:11.437 --> 41:14.205
facility on her watch.

41:14.605 --> 41:17.007
I completely understand, sir.

41:17.408 --> 41:19.410
But i still believe there
remains a positive aspect

41:19.445 --> 41:21.377
to this whole affair.

41:21.412 --> 41:24.215
I have to admit your success
with a counter-version of proxy

41:24.250 --> 41:28.619
blue is a mitigating
factor in this disaster.

41:29.019 --> 41:31.822
Why do the most distrustful
people make the easiest dupes?

41:31.857 --> 41:34.225
Is this the real
thing or is it ours?

41:34.260 --> 41:36.192
The real thing, sir.

41:36.227 --> 41:39.430
Of course, it all
depends on who you distrust.

41:39.465 --> 41:41.832
I'm talking to you, mr eckhart.

41:42.233 --> 41:45.436
Instead of bumping the
real proxy blue off the air,

41:45.471 --> 41:47.803
adam put me to work
cleaning out your system.

41:47.838 --> 41:51.241
