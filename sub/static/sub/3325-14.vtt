00:01.043 --> 00:01.998
Previously on "Teen Wolf..."

00:02.170 --> 00:04.206
Why're you looking at me
like this is my fault?

00:04.380 --> 00:05.415
You're seeing things, aren't you?

00:05.631 --> 00:07.747
- How'd you know?
- Because it's happening to all three of you.

00:08.801 --> 00:09.631
Wake up!

00:09.802 --> 00:12.293
Eight years ago, almost an entire
family died in a car accident.

00:12.513 --> 00:14.469
A young girl named Malia was never found.

00:14.682 --> 00:17.719
Two bodies that were still in the car
were covered in bites and slashes.

00:17.935 --> 00:18.890
Malia?

00:28.571 --> 00:29.777
You see this equipment?

00:29.989 --> 00:33.732
Very old. The settings are
not quite accurate anymore.

00:33.951 --> 00:36.158
So it's hard to tell
just how far to turn the dial.

00:36.370 --> 00:37.576
I think it's a little high.

00:39.874 --> 00:41.535
I've seen some crack their teeth.

00:41.751 --> 00:45.243
Others, they just shake and shake
even after their heart stops.

00:45.546 --> 00:47.878
Sometimes we don't even
know they're dead.

00:49.425 --> 00:53.293
But nobody wants
to play a guessing game.

00:53.721 --> 00:57.930
So, why don't you just tell us?
Where is "la loba?"

00:58.351 --> 01:01.184
We don't know where "la loba" is.

01:01.395 --> 01:04.478
No? Maybe you need
a different method of persuasion?

01:04.815 --> 01:08.683
Maybe we cut one of you in half,
the other talks?

01:09.862 --> 01:13.025
I would love to be there for volunteer,

01:13.241 --> 01:18.611
but we really don't know
what you're talking about.

01:19.830 --> 01:22.082
And honestly, isn't bisecting people

01:22.291 --> 01:24.782
with a broad sword a little medieval?

01:25.836 --> 01:26.916
Broad sword?

01:27.296 --> 01:28.672
We're not savages.

01:41.435 --> 01:44.563
We all wonder
how far your little healing trick goes.

01:46.524 --> 01:48.264
What do you think?
Can you grow back an arm?

01:48.526 --> 01:51.438
We're pretty sure you can't
grow back your head.

01:54.490 --> 01:55.570
Boys.

02:14.594 --> 02:16.300
No hablo espanol.

02:18.431 --> 02:22.219
Tu hablas muchos idiomas, Derek Hale.

02:22.893 --> 02:24.804
You know exactly what I'm saying.

02:25.229 --> 02:27.265
And you know who we want.

02:35.990 --> 02:37.855
Where is the She-Wolf?

02:38.534 --> 02:41.025
We don't know any She-Wolf.

02:43.914 --> 02:46.872
I know you won't talk, "lobito."

02:48.502 --> 02:50.083
This one will talk.

02:50.963 --> 02:54.922
This one loves the sound of his own voice.

02:55.801 --> 02:57.587
You should hear me sing.

02:57.887 --> 02:59.423
We want to hear you scream.

03:00.348 --> 03:02.259
No one ever wants to hear me sing.

03:04.602 --> 03:07.514
What could we do to persuade you?

03:16.781 --> 03:18.692
Where is the She-Wolf?

03:33.255 --> 03:39.672
Think about it.
I'm only going to ask you nine more times.

04:39.822 --> 04:40.811
Oh.

04:41.407 --> 04:43.773
- I think I found something.
- So did I.

04:58.591 --> 05:00.206
It's a coyote den.

05:00.843 --> 05:02.083
Werecoyote.

05:03.971 --> 05:05.507
You see this? This is Malia's.

05:05.723 --> 05:08.214
Remember, it's the same one
she was wearing in the photo.

05:16.317 --> 05:17.807
We shouldn't be in here.

05:18.360 --> 05:19.349
What do you mean?

05:19.570 --> 05:22.687
She's not going to come back now.
We just invaded her home.

05:22.907 --> 05:24.863
Our scent's going to be everywhere.

05:25.201 --> 05:27.487
If she's not going to come back here,
where's she going to go?

05:28.120 --> 05:29.656
I don't know.

05:31.081 --> 05:34.244
Can you track her now?
You think you got her scent?

05:34.794 --> 05:35.874
Maybe.

05:36.045 --> 05:38.878
But I'm better at this when I'm a full wolf.

05:39.965 --> 05:42.377
And I'm still worried that if I do it,

05:42.593 --> 05:44.003
I won't be able to turn back.

05:45.513 --> 05:47.424
The door's still open.

05:50.059 --> 05:53.392
If I can't get to Derek, we're gonna have to
find someone else to help.

05:57.817 --> 05:59.978
This is basically a crime scene, right?

06:00.611 --> 06:02.772
I think it might be
a little out of my boss's league.

06:04.532 --> 06:06.193
And more in my dad's.

06:20.297 --> 06:21.753
You're sure it was her?

06:21.966 --> 06:24.628
I looked her right in the eyes.
And they glowed just like mine.

06:24.844 --> 06:25.833
It makes sense, Dad.

06:26.303 --> 06:30.467
But it wasn't a girl.
It was a four-legged coyote, right?

06:30.850 --> 06:34.718
Well, okay. But yeah, see, that's the part
that we don't exactly have figured out yet.

06:34.937 --> 06:37.223
Okay, but if it was a full moon
and she did change

06:37.439 --> 06:39.566
while her mom was driving,
then anything could've happened.

06:39.775 --> 06:41.311
Horrible things could've happened.

06:41.527 --> 06:43.518
Ripping, shredding, tearing things.

06:43.737 --> 06:46.228
- Which is probably what caused the accident.
- Think about it, Dad, all right.

06:46.448 --> 06:49.190
They're driving, Malia starts to change,

06:49.368 --> 06:51.575
she goes out of control,
the mom crashes and everybody dies...

06:51.829 --> 06:52.989
Except for Malia.

06:53.247 --> 06:55.579
She blames herself,
all right, goes off running into the woods

06:55.791 --> 06:58.783
and eventually becomes
trapped inside the body of a coyote.

06:59.211 --> 07:00.496
That makes sense.

07:02.464 --> 07:04.796
In a Chinese folktale.

07:07.511 --> 07:11.049
Boys, this is... This is insane.

07:16.228 --> 07:17.764
I need this kept quiet.

07:18.105 --> 07:20.972
The two of you, not a word.
I don't want anyone hearing about this.

07:21.191 --> 07:24.354
I especially don't want
Mr. Tate hearing about this.

07:28.699 --> 07:29.905
Scott?

07:30.618 --> 07:31.607
Scott!

07:32.202 --> 07:33.282
Sorry.

07:36.498 --> 07:38.034
What did you say?

07:39.501 --> 07:40.786
Oh, hell.

07:47.760 --> 07:48.795
Mr. Tate.

07:57.186 --> 07:58.426
Mr. Tate?

08:00.189 --> 08:01.474
It's hers.

08:02.650 --> 08:04.811
All right, wait here.

08:05.027 --> 08:06.608
- Dad.
- I'll talk to you in a minute.

08:06.820 --> 08:08.356
I wouldn't mind hearing
how your mom's okay

08:08.572 --> 08:10.483
with you running around
in the woods this late.

08:11.951 --> 08:13.691
What the hell
are you doing bringing him here?

08:14.036 --> 08:16.903
I'm getting confirmation
on a more than significant lead.

08:17.122 --> 08:20.330
And starting to understand
why your department can't close cases.

08:20.542 --> 08:23.329
There's no body.
There's no remains to identify.

08:23.545 --> 08:26.082
Well, not yet, Sheriff. But do a little digging

08:26.924 --> 08:29.040
and I'm sure you'll uncover something.

08:30.844 --> 08:32.880
Like the bones of a 9-year-old girl.

08:36.350 --> 08:38.636
I think you're going to find
it's just a little bit more

08:38.852 --> 08:41.264
complicated than that, Special Agent.

08:41.522 --> 08:43.604
Come on, Stilinski,
you know how this goes.

08:43.816 --> 08:46.603
It's the not knowing that
ruins people like Tate.

08:46.819 --> 08:50.482
The truth, no matter
how profoundly it sucks...

08:51.031 --> 08:53.613
The truth is always better
than not knowing.

09:17.349 --> 09:19.726
Here's where we found the den.
It's right in the middle of the hiking trails.

09:19.935 --> 09:22.176
Well, that could narrow it down.
Coyotes travel in fixed trails.

09:22.396 --> 09:24.853
But I think you're right
about her not going back to the den.

09:25.065 --> 09:26.930
Coyotes don't like wolves.
And they're really smart.

09:27.151 --> 09:29.893
If they don't want to be heard,
they actually walk on their toes.

09:30.487 --> 09:31.693
Coyotes tip-toe?

09:32.031 --> 09:33.771
They tip-toe.

09:36.076 --> 09:38.658
- I gotta go, but send me the pinned location.
- Okay.

09:42.207 --> 09:44.459
Hi. I'm Kira. You knew that.

09:44.668 --> 09:46.704
I knew you knew that.
I don't know why I just told you that again.

09:46.962 --> 09:48.418
Anyway, I have something for you.

09:48.714 --> 09:50.625
- For me?
- Yeah.

09:50.841 --> 09:54.425
About the bardo. My explanation
was sort of all over the place,

09:54.636 --> 09:57.343
so I did some research and
I printed it out for you.

09:57.514 --> 09:59.175
Okay. You didn't have to do that.

09:59.349 --> 10:00.759
It only took a couple of hours.

10:01.143 --> 10:03.555
Wow. Then you really didn't have to do that.

10:03.729 --> 10:04.889
I swear I printed it out.

10:05.105 --> 10:08.597
Kira. You forgot all the research
you did for that boy you like.

10:32.466 --> 10:34.627
All right, everyone.
Let's get started.

10:34.843 --> 10:38.631
We were just talking about internment
camps and prisoners of war.

10:38.847 --> 10:40.098
There's a passage in our reading

10:40.307 --> 10:42.093
that I'd like to go over in more detail...

10:42.351 --> 10:45.434
Who would like to come up
and read aloud for us?

10:45.979 --> 10:48.186
Mr. Stilinski, how about you?

10:49.441 --> 10:52.433
Oh, maybe someone else could.

10:52.820 --> 10:55.106
Everyone participates
in my class, Mr. Stilinski.

10:55.823 --> 10:56.778
Okay.

11:34.570 --> 11:36.151
Stiles? You okay?

11:43.871 --> 11:45.736
I should take him to the nurse's office.

11:54.965 --> 11:58.002
Stiles, look at me, man.
Is this a panic attack?

12:02.306 --> 12:04.888
It's a dream, it's a dream.
This is just a dream.

12:05.100 --> 12:08.433
No, it's not. This is real.
You're here. You're here with me.

12:09.855 --> 12:11.846
Okay, what do you do?

12:12.107 --> 12:16.271
I mean, like, how do you
tell if you're awake or dreaming?

12:16.486 --> 12:18.613
Your fingers... You count your fingers.

12:18.822 --> 12:20.778
You have extra fingers in dreams.

12:23.118 --> 12:25.200
How many do l have? Hey!

12:25.954 --> 12:28.161
Look at me. Come on, Stiles.

12:28.498 --> 12:30.113
Look at my hands and count with me.

12:31.710 --> 12:32.745
One...

12:34.338 --> 12:35.453
Two.

12:36.006 --> 12:37.416
Keep going.

12:38.258 --> 12:39.373
Three.

12:40.886 --> 12:42.422
Foun

12:42.638 --> 12:43.923
Five.

12:44.306 --> 12:45.796
- Six.
- Seven.

12:46.433 --> 12:48.173
- Eight.
- Nine.

12:49.895 --> 12:50.930
Ten.

12:52.397 --> 12:53.477
Ten.

12:54.775 --> 12:55.764
Ten.

13:12.459 --> 13:13.960
What the hell is happening to me?

13:14.336 --> 13:16.292
We'll figure it out. You're going to be okay.

13:16.505 --> 13:17.790
Am I?

13:18.840 --> 13:20.000
Are you?

13:22.052 --> 13:26.045
Scott, you can't transform.
Allison's being haunted by her dead aunt.

13:26.890 --> 13:28.721
And I'm straight up losing my mind.

13:31.144 --> 13:34.352
We can't do this. We can't...

13:35.440 --> 13:37.055
We can't help Malia.

13:39.319 --> 13:40.980
We can't help anyone.

13:47.661 --> 13:49.117
We can try.

13:50.330 --> 13:52.446
We can always try.

13:55.294 --> 13:57.000
Do not forget the chapters
on President Carter

13:57.254 --> 13:59.870
and the Commission
on Wartime Relocation.

14:22.321 --> 14:23.686
Oh, my God.

15:56.206 --> 15:59.698
I don't want to make it sound
like we don't appreciate your hospitality

15:59.876 --> 16:03.118
but do you think
it would be possible to put that on ice?

16:03.338 --> 16:06.671
Maybe something for my hand?
Extra-large Band-Aid?

16:08.009 --> 16:10.591
Perhaps some antibiotic ointment?

16:40.959 --> 16:42.074
No.

17:00.395 --> 17:01.680
You're the one who saved Isaac.

17:01.938 --> 17:05.055
- I'm the one who was hired to save Isaac.
- Someone hired you to get us out of here?

17:05.233 --> 17:07.064
Someone hired me to get Derek out of here.

17:07.277 --> 17:09.768
You, I'm totally fine leaving for dead.

17:10.197 --> 17:12.062
When did I get this reputation?

17:12.240 --> 17:14.071
- Who hired you?
- Deucalion.

17:14.367 --> 17:17.234
Deucalion? The guy who did that to you?

17:18.371 --> 17:19.577
Girl's gotta eat.

17:21.708 --> 17:23.289
All right, let's get the hell out of here.

17:23.543 --> 17:24.658
We're not leaving without it.

17:24.878 --> 17:25.913
Without what?

17:28.256 --> 17:29.996
A couple of students said
they saw it running

17:30.175 --> 17:32.257
across the field and back into the woods.

17:32.469 --> 17:33.959
Thank God, nobody got hurt.

17:34.179 --> 17:36.044
What happens if she does hurt someone?

17:36.264 --> 17:38.175
Most likely
they'll have to put it down.

17:38.391 --> 17:41.849
Put her down?
Dad, try not to forget there's a girl in there,

17:42.020 --> 17:43.885
one that you'll be killing.

17:44.105 --> 17:46.096
Come on,
you aren't back to not believing, are you?

17:46.650 --> 17:50.313
I believe there are a lot of things
I don't understand yet.

17:50.529 --> 17:52.019
But that doesn't mean that everything

17:52.239 --> 17:54.696
and anything imaginable
is suddenly possible.

17:55.659 --> 18:00.528
Now, are you 100% sure
that this is a girl and not an animal?

18:00.830 --> 18:01.956
Yes.

18:04.501 --> 18:05.911
Because Scott's sure.

18:15.720 --> 18:17.676
Scott, you been listening?

18:25.480 --> 18:28.062
All right, let's get this figured out. Come on.

18:28.942 --> 18:31.228
Dad, seriously, I'm okay.

18:31.444 --> 18:33.605
Why were you not
headed to lunch like everyone else?

18:33.822 --> 18:36.780
They left their bags.
I was just trying to do something nice.

18:37.200 --> 18:40.237
You do something nice
and you make friends. Or so I've heard.

18:43.540 --> 18:46.452
Scott. I think I know
what she was looking for.

18:49.129 --> 18:50.539
You took the doll from the car?

18:50.755 --> 18:53.087
Yeah, I thought you could use it,
you know, for like her scent.

18:53.300 --> 18:56.713
Where did you get that?
Where did you find this?

19:00.557 --> 19:02.138
It belonged to my daughter.

19:02.392 --> 19:03.427
It's all right, boys.

19:03.643 --> 19:05.304
Mr. Tate, I don't know
how you heard about this.

19:05.520 --> 19:08.933
If you got your own police scanner or what...
But you can't be here.

19:18.366 --> 19:19.867
I have a permit.

19:20.452 --> 19:24.786
California schools are gun free zones,
permit or no permit.

19:25.040 --> 19:27.531
You need to leave, Mr. Tate. Now.

19:31.212 --> 19:35.171
You find that animal. You find that thing.

19:54.527 --> 19:57.394
Xylazine. It's a tranquilizer for horses.

19:57.697 --> 20:00.029
For a werecoyote,
expect it to work within seconds.

20:00.283 --> 20:01.523
I only have three.

20:01.743 --> 20:03.699
So whoever's shooting,
needs to be a damn good shot.

20:03.870 --> 20:05.201
Allison's a perfect shot.

20:05.413 --> 20:07.995
- She used to be.
- She can do it.

20:08.208 --> 20:09.323
If we manage to find the thing.

20:09.542 --> 20:11.828
Okay, what is the point of him?
Seriously, I mean, what is his purpose?

20:12.045 --> 20:14.787
Aside from
the persistent negativity and the scarf?

20:15.006 --> 20:17.383
What's up with the scarf anyway?
It's 65 degrees out.

20:18.093 --> 20:20.835
Look, maybe I'm asking a question
no one here wants to ask.

20:21.054 --> 20:24.421
How do we turn a coyote back into a girl,

20:24.641 --> 20:27.633
when she hasn't been a girl for eight years?

20:31.106 --> 20:33.347
- I can do it.
- You can?

20:33.566 --> 20:35.522
You remember the night
that Peter trapped us in the school?

20:35.694 --> 20:38.356
In the gym, he was able
to make me turn using just his voice.

20:38.571 --> 20:40.107
Deucalion did
the same thing in the distillery.

20:40.281 --> 20:41.862
This is a werecoyote, Scott.

20:42.200 --> 20:44.942
Who knows if it'll even work
if you can find someone who can teach you.

20:45.120 --> 20:46.610
That's why you called Derek, first.

20:46.830 --> 20:49.321
Yeah, I could try it on my own.

20:49.833 --> 20:53.121
But right now, I'm too scared to
even change into just a werewolf.

20:53.837 --> 20:55.498
We need a real Alpha.

20:56.715 --> 20:58.706
You know what I mean.
An Alpha who can do Alpha things.

20:58.925 --> 21:01.337
You know, an Alpha who can get it going.
You know, get it...

21:01.511 --> 21:02.876
Up?

21:03.596 --> 21:07.305
Great. I'm an Alpha
with performance issues.

21:07.559 --> 21:09.595
Is there anyone else
besides Derek who could help?

21:09.853 --> 21:11.013
I wouldn't trust Peter.

21:11.229 --> 21:13.766
- Maybe the twins?
- They're not Alphas anymore.

21:14.232 --> 21:16.939
After what Jennifer did,
almost killing them?

21:17.152 --> 21:18.642
It broke that part of them.

21:18.945 --> 21:20.651
Yeah, but what if they know how to do it?

21:21.156 --> 21:25.616
- Nobody's seen them for weeks.
- Well, actually, that's not totally true.

21:34.878 --> 21:36.584
They said they'd meet us here.

22:10.830 --> 22:12.912
I thought you guys
were gonna teach me to roar.

22:13.124 --> 22:15.035
We are. You do it by giving in.

22:15.251 --> 22:18.459
Giving in and letting go.
That's how Deucalion taught us control.

22:20.465 --> 22:21.705
Hey, you know, that's funny.

22:21.925 --> 22:24.962
I've actually tried something like this one time
using a heart monitor and lacrosse balls.

22:25.178 --> 22:27.294
But you're right, beating the living crap out
of him is probably a lot better.

22:27.514 --> 22:29.129
That's actually the plan? You kick my ass?

22:29.307 --> 22:31.263
You're afraid to turn.
We're going to make you.

22:31.476 --> 22:33.387
You turn. Then you kick our asses.

22:33.561 --> 22:34.971
And then you roar.

22:37.899 --> 22:41.062
You don't think you can let go with us?
You think you're going to hurt us?

22:41.236 --> 22:43.568
Come on, McCall. Give it your all.

22:43.863 --> 22:45.524
We can always heal.

22:47.116 --> 22:48.856
You're an Alpha.
You want to roar like one,

22:49.077 --> 22:51.864
you've got to give in full throttle.
You've got to be the monster.

22:52.080 --> 22:53.741
Become the beast.
Become everything you're afraid of.

22:53.957 --> 22:55.993
That's what gives you power.
It gives you strength.

22:58.586 --> 23:00.167
Giving into it
doesn't make you the bad guy.

23:00.421 --> 23:01.627
So long as you can control it.

23:01.840 --> 23:03.796
Sometimes control's a little overrated.

23:05.218 --> 23:06.708
Come on, Scott. Fight back.

23:08.388 --> 23:11.846
What if I can't control it?
What if I can't turn back?

23:12.183 --> 23:15.220
Then it takes over. You become Malia.

23:15.436 --> 23:17.347
You get further and further
away from being human.

23:17.564 --> 23:19.646
You turn into an animal. Or worse.

23:19.858 --> 23:21.098
You turn into Peter.

23:43.631 --> 23:46.088
What? I thought we were helping him.

23:46.259 --> 23:47.624
You help too much.

24:19.208 --> 24:21.199
Do you think you can hone in on Malia?

24:21.377 --> 24:23.459
If not, we're going to
be in the woods for a very long time.

24:24.714 --> 24:28.127
I've got a pretty good lock on her scent.
It's actually kind of strong.

24:28.343 --> 24:29.378
What is it?

24:30.845 --> 24:31.800
Pee.

24:41.773 --> 24:42.762
You okay?

25:25.566 --> 25:27.477
The ME marked
the cause of death as animal attack,

25:27.652 --> 25:31.315
but the authorities are
waiting for confirmation by autopsy.

25:31.531 --> 25:34.819
Personally, I think
it might have been something a little...

25:36.536 --> 25:37.571
Shangen

25:47.880 --> 25:49.791
Well, there's definitely
something wrong with it.

25:51.134 --> 25:53.500
The rest of the organs
look pretty good, though.

26:12.363 --> 26:13.603
Allison!

26:17.118 --> 26:18.654
Oh, my God! I'm so sorry.

26:21.456 --> 26:26.291
I'm... I'm so sorry.
I don't know what I was doing. I'm sorry.

26:28.129 --> 26:31.041
Ah, it's better than ring daggers, I guess.

26:34.135 --> 26:37.047
How am I supposed to help anyone
if I'm like this? What am I supposed to do?

26:37.263 --> 26:38.503
Allison.

26:41.059 --> 26:42.674
Let me help you.

26:47.648 --> 26:49.263
Show me what to do.

27:17.637 --> 27:20.219
Anyone else think
we might be doing more harm than good?

27:20.431 --> 27:22.763
We're trying to
keep a father from killing his own daughter.

27:22.934 --> 27:26.142
Actually, we're trying
to keep a guy from killing a coyote

27:26.354 --> 27:27.764
who is actually his daughter,

27:27.980 --> 27:31.268
who we don't know how to
change from a coyote back to his daughter.

27:31.526 --> 27:33.266
And again with the not helping.

27:37.907 --> 27:39.067
Did you bring it?

27:48.376 --> 27:51.288
A jogger on her early morning
run almost stepped right into this.

27:51.546 --> 27:55.505
Now, you want to tell me exactly how many
of those you put out there?

28:03.349 --> 28:04.850
Sheriff, hold on...

28:10.481 --> 28:12.972
Oh, my God.
Some kid could get trapped in one of these.

28:13.192 --> 28:15.604
Some kid could die in one of these.

28:16.154 --> 28:17.769
My kid died.

28:18.406 --> 28:19.612
Mine.

28:20.324 --> 28:22.986
You and me.
We're going out there right now.

28:23.202 --> 28:25.488
And we're going to disarm every single one,

28:25.705 --> 28:27.991
I don't care if it takes all night.

28:37.300 --> 28:39.006
It's in the house.

29:06.704 --> 29:07.944
Tate!

29:09.248 --> 29:10.363
Tate!

29:23.137 --> 29:24.673
Wait, wait. Wait! Wait!

29:26.974 --> 29:31.092
I want the woods cleared of hikers, joggers,
anybody else who might be on those trails.

29:34.315 --> 29:38.274
It took the doll again? What the hell
is so important about this doll?

29:38.486 --> 29:41.728
I don't know, but listen to me.
There are traps all over the woods.

29:41.906 --> 29:43.942
Near the trails.
Probably near the car crash.

29:44.158 --> 29:45.739
And Tate is out there with a rifle.

29:45.910 --> 29:48.947
I want you to stay out of those woods.
You got that?

29:49.705 --> 29:50.820
Stiles?

29:54.377 --> 29:56.413
- It's the doll.
- Stiles?

29:58.714 --> 30:00.454
It's the doll?

30:12.853 --> 30:14.718
All right, but why would it
go all the way to the school

30:14.897 --> 30:17.559
and then all the way
back to the house just for a doll?

30:17.775 --> 30:19.276
One that was
in the car wreck in the first place.

30:19.443 --> 30:21.058
We didn't find it in the coyote den.

30:21.279 --> 30:23.019
It likes the doll. Who cares?

30:23.239 --> 30:25.195
Yeah, it likes the doll a lot.

30:26.617 --> 30:30.155
- What kind of doll is it?
- I don't know. It's a doll, you know.

30:30.371 --> 30:34.910
It's got little arms,
a big baby head and dead, soulless eyes.

30:35.960 --> 30:37.666
Actually, I took a pic.

30:38.004 --> 30:39.039
Here.

30:41.799 --> 30:42.914
That's Malia?

30:43.134 --> 30:45.341
Yeah, that's the jacket
and the scarf we found in the den.

30:46.429 --> 30:49.011
Stiles, she's not holding the doll.

30:50.474 --> 30:52.430
That's Malia's younger sister.

30:53.477 --> 30:55.092
So it's her doll.

31:01.193 --> 31:03.605
- I know what she's doing.
- What?

31:06.991 --> 31:08.856
I know where she's going.

31:14.123 --> 31:15.613
Isaac, wait!

31:51.660 --> 31:53.742
Allison, there he is.

31:58.751 --> 32:01.458
Hit Tate. Use the tranq gun on him.

32:01.670 --> 32:02.625
Okay?

32:12.973 --> 32:14.713
Okay, come on.

32:20.022 --> 32:20.977
Allison!

32:21.148 --> 32:22.183
Breathe.

33:05.943 --> 33:07.899
Isaac, she's gone.

33:08.863 --> 33:11.275
Scott, it's me,
you got to call me back as soon as you can.

33:11.490 --> 33:13.355
It wasn't Malia's doll. It was her sister's.

33:13.576 --> 33:17.285
Malia left it at the car for her sister.
It's like bringing flowers to a grave.

33:17.496 --> 33:20.909
Okay, and we stole the flowers.
So, that's all she's trying to do, right.

33:21.083 --> 33:23.074
Bring the doll back to the grave,
to the car wreck.

33:23.294 --> 33:24.625
That's where she's headed.
The car wreck.

33:24.837 --> 33:26.452
- Stiles?
- Yeah.

33:41.896 --> 33:43.432
- Stiles?
- Lydia, don't move.

33:47.318 --> 33:49.149
Instructions on how to disarm it.

33:49.320 --> 33:51.402
Lydia, why the hell would they put
instructions on the bottom of a trap?

33:51.655 --> 33:53.566
Because animals can't read.

34:09.757 --> 34:11.372
Lydia, we got a problem.

34:11.550 --> 34:12.505
Huh?

34:14.929 --> 34:16.669
I can't read either.

34:32.738 --> 34:34.444
You don't need the instructions.

34:35.324 --> 34:38.031
When was the last time
you've ever used instructions? Am I right?

34:40.704 --> 34:46.290
You don't need them because you're too
smart to waste your time with them, okay?

34:48.003 --> 34:49.834
You can figure it out.

34:51.090 --> 34:55.675
Stiles, you're the one
who always figures it out.

34:57.972 --> 34:59.428
So you can do it.

35:00.808 --> 35:05.472
Figure it out.

35:26.625 --> 35:28.081
Okay, here we go.

35:30.754 --> 35:31.743
Ready?

35:37.344 --> 35:39.756
Okay, here we go.

37:03.597 --> 37:05.553
That's what I'm talking about.

38:31.185 --> 38:32.391
Mr. Tate.

38:41.278 --> 38:42.779
Malia?

39:48.262 --> 39:50.674
It's made from a Rowan tree.

39:51.265 --> 39:53.051
It's mountain ash wood.

40:01.441 --> 40:04.228
And that would be just mountain ash.

40:04.444 --> 40:07.356
Somebody really doesn't
want our hands in there.
