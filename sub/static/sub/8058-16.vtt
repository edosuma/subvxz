WEBVTT

00:01.431 --> 00:03.299
Okay, I don't want
to over-hype this,

00:03.333 --> 00:05.001
but presenting...
Dun-da-da-dah!

00:05.035 --> 00:07.226
the new city of Pawnee website!

00:07.346 --> 00:08.746
Totally revamped!

00:08.781 --> 00:10.148
You can pay parking tickets,

00:10.182 --> 00:13.351
you can apply for a business
license and the best part

00:13.385 --> 00:15.305
is we're going to put up
an online poll so people

00:15.320 --> 00:16.988
can pick the new town slogan!

00:17.022 --> 00:18.389
Hey, look a panda!

00:18.423 --> 00:20.658
Yeah, that's just some mascot
thing

00:20.692 --> 00:22.326
that the designer put up
on the front page.

00:22.361 --> 00:23.628
But more importantly,

00:23.662 --> 00:26.597
you can now apply for a utility
tax refund...online!

00:26.632 --> 00:28.399
Wait, the panda's name
is Peebo.

00:28.434 --> 00:29.467
Peebo.

00:29.501 --> 00:30.902
Look, you can even play
ping-pong.

00:30.936 --> 00:32.403
- What?
- I want to play!

00:32.438 --> 00:34.806
No, me first! Me first!
That's it. I'm calling it.

00:34.840 --> 00:36.741
Guys, Ben worked
really hard on this, okay?

00:36.775 --> 00:38.309
Let's look at the online polls.

00:38.344 --> 00:40.078
It's gonna be a cool way
to choose our new town's slogan.

00:40.112 --> 00:42.046
Oh! The panda holds a paddle
with his tail.

00:42.081 --> 00:43.114
I want to play!

00:43.148 --> 00:44.415
Congratulations, Ben.

00:44.450 --> 00:47.318
This is truly a fine panda game
you made. Well done.

00:47.352 --> 00:48.419
What else does he do?

00:48.454 --> 00:50.388
I think if you click on
the bamboo,

00:50.422 --> 00:51.522
it puts on a top hat.

00:52.591 --> 00:53.925
What?

00:53.959 --> 00:55.660
I love you, Ben!

00:58.697 --> 01:04.702

Advertise your product or brand here

01:17.783 --> 01:19.050
What's wrong with you?

01:19.084 --> 01:21.352
You look like Meryl Streep
at the end of <i> Ironweed.</i>

01:21.387 --> 01:22.787
You wish.

01:22.821 --> 01:24.789
Well, I've been driving
all over Indiana

01:24.823 --> 01:26.758
looking for bands to play
the unity concert.

01:26.792 --> 01:28.126
I got nothing to show for,

01:28.160 --> 01:30.261
except for four car accidents.

01:30.295 --> 01:33.664
All these strangers'
insurance information.

01:33.699 --> 01:35.533
Ooh, I get it,
you have car insurance.

01:35.567 --> 01:37.168
Why don't you brag about it?

01:37.202 --> 01:38.703
Hey, you are from Eagleton,
right?

01:38.737 --> 01:40.872
Are there any places out there
I should check out?

01:40.906 --> 01:42.974
I used to go see live shows
at Patterson's.

01:43.008 --> 01:45.143
But I'm boycotting until
the owner apologizes

01:45.177 --> 01:47.011
for what she said to me
at the dog park.

01:47.045 --> 01:49.113
Cool. Anything else?

01:49.148 --> 01:51.049
I hear Cozy's Bar is pretty
packed on Thursdays.

01:51.083 --> 01:53.351
But I've never been because
it's mostly middle-aged women

01:53.385 --> 01:55.019
and I'm allergic
to turkey neck.

01:55.054 --> 01:56.254
Really?
That's the best part.

01:56.288 --> 01:59.157
We should split
a turkey sometime.

01:59.191 --> 02:00.525
Oh, Mr. Larson.

02:00.559 --> 02:01.793
Thank you so much
for meeting me here.

02:01.827 --> 02:03.327
Happy to.
I was in the area.

02:03.362 --> 02:05.797
The chance for me to return
your binder full of questions

02:05.831 --> 02:07.198
about the job.

02:07.232 --> 02:08.472
I think I answered all of them.

02:08.500 --> 02:10.268
Thank you.
I cannot wait to check this out.

02:10.301 --> 02:12.503
Now, the reason why I asked you
to meet me here...

02:12.538 --> 02:13.938
More questions about the job.

02:13.972 --> 02:15.506
Oh, yeah.

02:15.541 --> 02:18.042
Martha? I'm gonna need
two hours worth of waffles.

02:18.077 --> 02:20.778
Grant Larson has offered me
a chance to oversee

02:20.813 --> 02:23.214
a branch office
of the national park service.

02:23.248 --> 02:25.950
This is like the parks
equivalent of Bruce Springsteen

02:25.984 --> 02:27.719
pulling Courtney Cox onstage.

02:27.753 --> 02:29.987
I mean, one minute you're just
a regular girl in the crowd,

02:30.022 --> 02:32.056
and the next minute you're
dancing 10 feet away

02:32.091 --> 02:34.759
from freakin' Max Weinberg!

02:34.793 --> 02:37.528
Okay, my fortieth and eighteenth
from last question

02:37.563 --> 02:40.631
is about the Heartland Exotic
Plant Management Project.

02:40.666 --> 02:43.901
Now, were would I be actually
doing the physical planting?

02:43.936 --> 02:45.737
Because it is always been
a dream of mine

02:45.771 --> 02:48.573
to plant spotted jewelweed
along the red river bank

02:48.607 --> 02:51.042
in Arkansas, but I'm sure
you hear that a lot.

02:51.076 --> 02:53.611
Well, you wouldn't actually be
planting things.

02:53.645 --> 02:55.880
I mean, you're overseeing
200 people.

02:55.914 --> 02:58.549
The everyday minutia
you would delegate to staff.

02:58.584 --> 03:01.819
Leslie, your job is more
creative, big picture stuff.

03:01.854 --> 03:03.888
No more boring people working
for you.

03:03.922 --> 03:06.924
Good!
I hate paperwork.

03:06.959 --> 03:09.260
I hardly ever do it in my bed
on a Saturday night

03:09.294 --> 03:12.096
while listening
to old spice girls CDs.

03:12.131 --> 03:13.998
Regal Meagle.
My favorite realtor.

03:14.033 --> 03:15.733
You got some hot properties
to show me?

03:15.768 --> 03:17.034
You know it.

03:17.069 --> 03:18.736
Remember my list of
must-haves: Open kitchen,

03:18.771 --> 03:20.805
fireplace, exposed brick,
and you know

03:20.839 --> 03:22.473
I wouldn't kick a skylight
out of bed.

03:22.508 --> 03:24.876
I'm opening Pawnee's first
authentic Sinatra style

03:24.910 --> 03:25.943
Italian restaurant...

03:25.978 --> 03:27.578
"Tom's Bistro."

03:27.613 --> 03:30.782
I'm kind of like a skinny,
handsome, Indian Mario Batali...

03:30.816 --> 03:32.183
who doesn't know how to cook.

03:32.217 --> 03:34.786
Before we go, I got you guys
a little something

03:34.820 --> 03:36.120
for helping me out.

03:36.155 --> 03:38.723
Oh! Love it!

03:38.757 --> 03:41.526
A Larry voodoo doll?

03:41.560 --> 03:43.761
Tom, that's so sweet.
Thanks.

03:43.796 --> 03:46.931
Ow! Oh, my gosh!

03:46.965 --> 03:48.132
I didn't even do anything.

03:48.167 --> 03:50.134
The voodoo doll is reading
my thoughts.

03:50.169 --> 03:52.403
So it seems like it went
really well, right?

03:52.438 --> 03:53.905
Yeah. Yeah, totally.

03:53.939 --> 03:55.907
Grant is great,
the job is great.

03:55.941 --> 03:57.875
- The waffles were great.
- Great.

03:57.910 --> 03:59.310
So we're just about ready
to go live

03:59.311 --> 04:00.611
with the slogan poll.
You want to see?

04:00.646 --> 04:02.447
Now that Eagleton and Pawnee
have merged,

04:02.481 --> 04:05.116
it is time to pick
a new town slogan.

04:05.150 --> 04:08.453
And a slogan can make a big
difference with tourism

04:08.487 --> 04:09.587
in a town's identity.

04:09.622 --> 04:11.022
There is New York,

04:11.056 --> 04:12.657
the city that never sleeps.

04:12.691 --> 04:15.593
And then there is Glenwater,
Florida,

04:15.627 --> 04:18.930
home of America's most violent
Walmart parking lot.

04:18.964 --> 04:20.798
Okay, so people can vote now.

04:20.833 --> 04:23.334
Yeah, see, that's the super
cool thing about this website

04:23.368 --> 04:26.204
is it does all the work for us
so we can just sit back

04:26.238 --> 04:28.139
and take it easy.

04:28.173 --> 04:30.675
No. No, we're not gonna
do that.

04:30.709 --> 04:32.944
We're gonna sit forward
and take it hard.

04:32.978 --> 04:34.679
- Um, what?
- There's a lot of nitty-gritty

04:34.713 --> 04:35.780
left to do, Ben.

04:35.814 --> 04:37.081
We need to roll up our sleeves,

04:37.116 --> 04:38.249
we need to go door to door,

04:38.283 --> 04:39.851
we need to hand out fliers,
and canvass.

04:39.885 --> 04:41.185
You know what we should do?

04:41.220 --> 04:43.321
We should have a press junket,
to publicize the poll.

04:43.355 --> 04:44.635
Okay, I hope you had lunch
plans,

04:44.656 --> 04:45.977
'cause now you get
to cancel them.

04:45.991 --> 04:48.026
Well, I-I did.

04:48.060 --> 04:51.429
So this was one of Eagleton's
top sushi restaurants.

04:51.463 --> 04:53.631
But you can't out-run
the whale meat police forever.

04:53.665 --> 04:55.166
This is great.
I love it!

04:55.200 --> 04:56.701
Look at it,
I can picture it now.

04:56.735 --> 04:58.336
That's where the politicians
will sit,

04:58.370 --> 05:00.805
this is where the connected
guys will bring their <i> goomahs.</i>

05:00.839 --> 05:02.039
This place is perfect.

05:02.074 --> 05:03.708
- How much?
- 9,000 a month.

05:03.742 --> 05:05.176
What? That's way more
that I can afford.

05:05.210 --> 05:06.544
Whatever.
It's not that great.

05:06.578 --> 05:07.979
Plus, it's really far away
from work

05:08.013 --> 05:09.547
and that'd be annoying.

05:09.581 --> 05:11.315
It's not a big deal.

05:11.350 --> 05:13.017
I mean, when it first launches
I'll go back and forth,

05:13.052 --> 05:16.120
but hopefully it takes off and
it'll become a full-time job.

05:16.155 --> 05:18.689
Come on, I'll show some places
in your price range.

05:21.160 --> 05:24.028
This press junket
is a brilliant idea, isn't it?

05:24.063 --> 05:27.131
Mr. Strange Cameraman
Who I Never Met.

05:27.166 --> 05:29.267
Leslie, I told you,
I'm not gonna participate

05:29.301 --> 05:32.370
in your weird Julia Roberts,
cameraman husband fantasy.

05:32.404 --> 05:33.705
Quiet, cameraman, Perd's here.

05:33.739 --> 05:37.108
Leslie, your poll is designed
to choose a new slogan.

05:37.142 --> 05:40.645
And a slogan is a series of
words that have a meaning.

05:40.679 --> 05:42.914
So true, Perd.

05:42.948 --> 05:44.148
All of the choices

05:44.183 --> 05:46.517
for the town slogan
are wonderful,

05:46.552 --> 05:48.753
but if I had to choose
my favorite

05:48.787 --> 05:52.357
it would probably be
"Storied past, bright future."

05:52.391 --> 05:56.360
Well, the story of <i> my</i> interest
level is: It's medium.

05:56.395 --> 05:58.162
Joan, this poll is a chance
to give

05:58.197 --> 06:00.598
our newly-merged city
a new identity...

06:00.632 --> 06:03.668
to really rebrand this town.

06:03.702 --> 06:06.270
Yes, great question.
I have been thinking

06:06.305 --> 06:07.605
of rebranding myself.

06:07.639 --> 06:11.009
What do you think about
Juan Callamezzo?

06:11.043 --> 06:12.744
Isn't "Juan" a man's name?

06:12.778 --> 06:14.345
No, it means "flower."

06:14.380 --> 06:15.847
I think it means "John."

06:15.881 --> 06:18.883
Crazy Ira and the Douche

06:18.917 --> 06:22.053
from 93.7 FM, the Groove.

06:22.087 --> 06:24.922
Leslie, do you believe
that this new slogan

06:24.957 --> 06:26.691
will integrate Pawnee
and Eagleton

06:26.725 --> 06:28.793
into one cohesive city?

06:28.827 --> 06:32.463
Wow, that's a very thoughtful
question, Crazy Ira.

06:32.498 --> 06:33.765
Yes, yes, I do.

06:33.799 --> 06:35.233
Follow-up question, Leslie,

06:35.267 --> 06:38.136
show us your boobs!

06:39.438 --> 06:41.205
Will this fit
on a bumper sticker?

06:43.242 --> 06:44.409
Gosh, this place is packed.

06:44.443 --> 06:46.110
You folks must really like
this guy.

06:46.145 --> 06:48.413
Honey, he is sex on a stick.

06:48.447 --> 06:49.914
Ladies and gentlemen,

06:49.948 --> 06:54.152
put your jazzy hands together
for my man, Mr. Duke Silver!

06:57.289 --> 07:00.625
A smooth and silky evening
to you all.

07:00.659 --> 07:03.294
On nights like this,
when the cold winds blow,

07:03.328 --> 07:06.898
and the air is awash
in the swirling eddies

07:06.932 --> 07:08.399
of our dreams,

07:08.434 --> 07:11.402
come with me
and find safe haven...

07:11.437 --> 07:15.139
in a warm bathtub
full of my jazz.

07:15.174 --> 07:17.508
Uh!

07:20.612 --> 07:23.548
Well, the good news is
your poll was a big hit.

07:23.582 --> 07:24.782
Thousands of people voted.

07:24.817 --> 07:26.117
That's great.
What's leading?

07:26.151 --> 07:28.820
- "Storied past, bright future"?
- No.

07:28.854 --> 07:30.188
The current leader is

07:30.222 --> 07:33.491
"Pawnee,
welcome to Douche nation."

07:33.525 --> 07:35.426
- What?
- Crazy Ira and the Douche

07:35.461 --> 07:37.362
got their bonehead radio fans

07:37.396 --> 07:39.497
to flood the poll
with write-in votes.

07:39.531 --> 07:41.265
Why did we include
a write-in option?

07:41.300 --> 07:43.201
Because every election
has a write-in option.

07:43.235 --> 07:45.036
That's how democracy works.

07:45.070 --> 07:47.271
I'm not a dictator.
If I we're a dictator,

07:47.306 --> 07:50.408
I would throw the Douche
in prison without a trial.

07:50.442 --> 07:52.477
I would be
a very strong dictator,

07:52.511 --> 07:55.780
and you would be my bodyguard,
and you would lead my army.

07:55.814 --> 07:58.549
Okay, I know we should
figure out how to fix this.

07:58.584 --> 08:00.485
But I'm starting
to get kind of turned on

08:00.519 --> 08:02.286
imagining you as a dictator,
is that bad?

08:02.321 --> 08:03.721
No, it's okay.

08:06.397 --> 08:07.797
You know,
we could just figure out

08:07.821 --> 08:09.776
a different strategy
for picking a slogan.

08:09.896 --> 08:11.463
You don't have to go
on their show.

08:11.498 --> 08:13.098
No, I want to do this.
I enjoy the challenge.

08:13.133 --> 08:14.733
So, how do I look?

08:14.768 --> 08:17.816
I need these guys to think
that I'm, like, super chill.

08:17.936 --> 08:18.696
Is this gonna work?

08:18.727 --> 08:20.072
Oh, what up, Lez?

08:20.192 --> 08:23.340
Backwards hat...shows a real
lack of respect for authority.

08:23.375 --> 08:24.708
I like that.

08:24.743 --> 08:26.110
What's up, little mayor?

08:26.144 --> 08:27.911
Are you gonna freak out again?

08:27.946 --> 08:29.913
So, Leslie, what's the deal?

08:29.948 --> 08:32.082
Are you just here
to yell at us again?

08:32.116 --> 08:35.818
Yeah, we are in store for
another Leslie Knope nag sesh?

08:35.854 --> 08:38.756
Crazy Ira, do the dishes!

08:38.789 --> 08:40.461
Classic! No way!

08:40.587 --> 08:42.022
I'm not here to nag, guys.

08:42.056 --> 08:43.897
I'm just psyched
to be in the studio, you know?

08:43.924 --> 08:46.893
I'm just...chillin'
in the studes with my dudes.

08:46.928 --> 08:48.795
If you're really not really
here to nag us,

08:48.830 --> 08:52.132
then maybe you'll help us
with our next segment...

08:52.166 --> 08:56.303
"Rating celebrities' boobs!"

08:56.337 --> 08:57.971
Perfect.

08:58.006 --> 09:01.441
On a scale, from 1 to
ga-ga-ga-going!

09:01.476 --> 09:05.245
How would you rate
Emma Watson's boobs?

09:05.279 --> 09:07.848
First of all, I would rate
her acting as an "A."

09:07.882 --> 09:10.117
You have three seconds to
answer or we're gonna withdraw

09:10.151 --> 09:13.053
- a donation from charity.
- From charity? Oh.

09:14.222 --> 09:15.255
A minus.

09:15.289 --> 09:18.492
More like double D <i>minus.</i>

09:19.527 --> 09:22.229
Me so horny!

09:22.263 --> 09:24.364
I knew it. I knew it.

09:29.437 --> 09:31.338
- Can I help you?
- Maybe.

09:31.372 --> 09:33.440
I was out at the jazz club
last night...

09:33.474 --> 09:35.842
scouting bands
for the unity concert.

09:35.877 --> 09:37.944
And I saw something
very interesting.

09:43.317 --> 09:45.085
- I am Duke Silver.
- I have a twin brother.

09:45.119 --> 09:46.687
What?

09:46.721 --> 09:50.123
- I have a twin brother.
- You are Duke Silver?

09:50.158 --> 09:51.124
Yes, I am Duke Silver.

09:54.595 --> 09:57.464
The only other people
who know are Tom and April.

09:57.498 --> 09:59.132
So, please, keep it to yourself.

09:59.167 --> 10:01.068
Are you kidding me?
You are really good!

10:01.102 --> 10:03.370
You are, like,
the saxophone player

10:03.404 --> 10:05.105
for the California-raisins-good.

10:05.139 --> 10:06.473
No joke.
You know what?

10:06.507 --> 10:09.242
I'm booking you...
for the unity concert.

10:09.277 --> 10:10.477
Absolutely not.

10:10.511 --> 10:12.379
My musical career is private.

10:12.413 --> 10:14.081
If my secret got out,

10:14.115 --> 10:16.550
this office would be waist-deep
in women's undergarments.

10:16.584 --> 10:18.752
No, I'm in charge of booking
the bands for the concert,

10:18.786 --> 10:20.786
and I say, you're in.
You're gonna play right after

10:20.788 --> 10:22.789
Bobby knight ranger.
It's a night ranger cover band

10:22.824 --> 10:24.224
where they only
wear read sweaters.

10:24.258 --> 10:26.093
It's gonna be epic!

10:26.127 --> 10:27.995
Final round, Leslie,

10:28.029 --> 10:30.163
boobs or ass?

10:30.198 --> 10:33.934
Hard to believe this is a fan
game for your radio listeners.

10:33.968 --> 10:36.303
Ah...I'm gonna say butt.

10:36.337 --> 10:37.304
Ding, ding, ding!

10:37.338 --> 10:38.939
- Yes!
- You are correct.

10:38.973 --> 10:41.808
This is my mom's dumper!

10:42.844 --> 10:44.111
Oh, mommy!

10:44.145 --> 10:45.579
I don't know how
you got yours hand on that.

10:45.613 --> 10:47.014
I took it.

10:47.048 --> 10:49.950
Good. Well, it is been so fun
bro-ing out with my dogs.

10:49.984 --> 10:53.787
I never knew that objectifying
women could be so much fun.

10:53.821 --> 10:55.101
We're running out of time here

10:55.123 --> 10:57.024
so just a quick reminder
to write-in

10:57.058 --> 10:59.826
"Welcome to Douche nation!"

10:59.861 --> 11:03.196
As the official town slogan
for pawneecity.gov.

11:03.231 --> 11:06.133
Or you know what would also be
kind of dope

11:06.167 --> 11:08.335
for the people of Douche nation
to do?

11:08.369 --> 11:10.037
It's vote for another slogan.

11:10.071 --> 11:13.940
Like, you know,
"Storied past, bright future"?

11:13.975 --> 11:17.277
But...I don't care.
I don't give a fart, bros.

11:17.312 --> 11:19.646
You know, just do your thing,
chicken wing.

11:20.915 --> 11:22.149
Hey, Crazy Ira,
have you seen my stick?

11:22.183 --> 11:23.623
- Where's your stick?
- I don't know.

11:23.651 --> 11:25.552
Lesbo Baggins,
you know where my stick is?

11:25.586 --> 11:27.788
- You...
- Oh! Found my stick.

11:27.822 --> 11:29.723
Oh, where did you find it?

11:29.757 --> 11:33.660
Up Leslie Knope's butt!

11:33.695 --> 11:36.029
- Yo, where my stick up?
- It's up her butt,<i> papi.</i>

11:37.899 --> 11:41.068
Jewish Greg, whatever we're
paying you, it's not enough.

11:43.404 --> 11:45.005
Damn it,
I almost pulled that off.

11:45.039 --> 11:46.406
No, you really didn't.

11:46.441 --> 11:49.409
Just delete the poll.
Let the slogan thing go.

11:49.444 --> 11:51.745
Or, maybe we sneak back
in there...

11:51.779 --> 11:54.047
you distract those guys
for, like, 30, 90 minutes,

11:54.082 --> 11:56.002
I get on live radio,
I give an impassioned speech

11:56.017 --> 11:57.651
about what slogan
I want to endorse

11:57.685 --> 11:59.725
and I play a few songs,
which I always wanted to do,

11:59.754 --> 12:01.388
and then we just see
what happens.

12:01.422 --> 12:03.023
No.

12:03.057 --> 12:04.358
I should just let this go.
Okay.

12:10.231 --> 12:11.999
Dude, what are you doing?

12:12.033 --> 12:14.501
That looks like a perfectly good
saxophone case.

12:14.535 --> 12:17.471
Wait a minute.
What's inside that case?

12:17.505 --> 12:19.706
I am ending
my secret musical career.

12:19.741 --> 12:22.509
- I have to kill Duke Silver.
- No, come on, man.

12:22.543 --> 12:23.543
You're really good.

12:23.578 --> 12:25.545
- You can't quit.
- Sorry, Andrew.

12:25.580 --> 12:26.780
I would rather never play again

12:26.814 --> 12:28.982
than have everyone know
my secret.

12:29.984 --> 12:32.052
Good-bye, Duke Silver.

12:32.086 --> 12:35.355
May you rest...in jazz.

12:38.726 --> 12:42.195
So, Tom told you are sort
of like a computer expert.

12:42.230 --> 12:43.730
Uh...yeah.

12:43.765 --> 12:45.399
You can say that.

12:45.433 --> 12:47.467
These jerks are trying
to hijack my online poll,

12:47.502 --> 12:50.070
and so far the leading town
slogan is,

12:50.104 --> 12:52.372
"Home of the stick
up Leslie Knope's butt."

12:52.407 --> 12:54.007
Yeah, yeah.
I voted for that one.

12:54.042 --> 12:56.810
Great. I'm wondering,
is there a way I can communicate

12:56.844 --> 12:58.979
- with everybody who voted?
- Yeah, I can do that.

12:59.013 --> 13:00.280
Should take about two minutes.

13:00.315 --> 13:02.315
Just PayPal me some bitcoins
when you get a chance.

13:02.317 --> 13:04.885
What?

13:04.919 --> 13:06.319
So, this is way
under your budget.

13:06.321 --> 13:09.456
Used to be a donut shop.
Well, a tire shop

13:09.490 --> 13:11.091
- that sold donuts.
- Pretty rough.

13:11.125 --> 13:12.426
I mean, I guess I could fix
the roof

13:12.460 --> 13:14.094
and tear up the counters.

13:14.128 --> 13:15.362
Do something about the smell.

13:15.396 --> 13:16.797
This place is creepy.

13:16.831 --> 13:19.933
I mean, I love it, because
it reminds me of the cafeteria

13:19.968 --> 13:21.768
in a haunted nursing home,
but...

13:21.803 --> 13:23.270
that's just me.

13:23.304 --> 13:24.805
This is the last listing I have

13:24.839 --> 13:26.473
that isn't an active crime
scene.

13:26.507 --> 13:27.608
Hey, man, what happened?

13:27.642 --> 13:29.576
I thought Jurassic Fork
was super popular.

13:29.611 --> 13:30.911
We stretched ourselves too thin

13:30.945 --> 13:32.813
by expanding to
a second location.

13:32.847 --> 13:34.848
You opened another
dinosaur-themed restaurant?

13:34.882 --> 13:37.017
No, another Steven
Spielberg-themed restaurant.

13:37.051 --> 13:39.419
The German place downtown...
Schindler's Lunch.

13:39.454 --> 13:41.688
I think you may have
misunderstood what people liked

13:41.723 --> 13:43.023
about Jurassic Fork.

13:43.057 --> 13:44.758
I actually think the space
is pretty cool.

13:44.792 --> 13:46.660
Obviously, we'd had to move
this T-Rex, but...

13:46.694 --> 13:48.762
No can do.
That's a load-bearing T-Rex.

13:48.796 --> 13:51.264
This is really the last place
you have available?

13:51.299 --> 13:54.835
Dang. Maybe Tom's Bistro
wasn't meant to be.

13:56.371 --> 13:59.039
- You wanted to see me?
- Yeah, real quick.

13:59.073 --> 14:00.874
Remember when you said
you would close up shop

14:00.908 --> 14:02.910
- on the slogan thing?
- Yes.

14:02.944 --> 14:04.378
You did do that, right?

14:04.412 --> 14:06.914
You didn't somehow get the email
addresses for every person

14:06.948 --> 14:08.715
who voted for the
"Stick up the butt" slogan

14:08.750 --> 14:12.319
and then write each of them
a personalized heartfelt email

14:12.353 --> 14:13.674
telling them
to do the right thing

14:13.688 --> 14:14.955
and vote for a real slogan?

14:14.989 --> 14:18.225
Are you crazy?
What a crazy talk you just did

14:18.259 --> 14:19.760
with your funny words.

14:19.794 --> 14:22.062
Well, someone wrote
those emails.

14:22.096 --> 14:25.566
And we got about 300 complaints
and as a cherry on top

14:25.600 --> 14:28.535
some hackers got really mad
about the invasion of privacy

14:28.569 --> 14:30.971
and attacked the website.

14:32.540 --> 14:34.508
Look what they did to Peebo.

14:34.542 --> 14:37.244
He's wearing a hat
made of penises.

14:37.278 --> 14:38.879
Oh, boy.

14:40.239 --> 14:41.990
Well, I.T. is fixing
the website,

14:42.017 --> 14:43.618
but it will be down
for about three days.

14:43.643 --> 14:45.443
Well, no worries, I will handle

14:45.478 --> 14:47.799
all of the overflow work
personally.

14:47.919 --> 14:50.102
Parking tickets,
code violations...

14:50.136 --> 14:51.737
- send them all to me.
- What's going on?

14:51.738 --> 14:53.538
I don't know.
I spoke to grant

14:53.573 --> 14:55.707
about the national parks job,
and he mentioned

14:55.742 --> 14:58.410
that's mostly big picture
planning and delegating,

14:58.444 --> 15:00.545
and not very much
nitty-gritty,

15:00.580 --> 15:02.647
hands-on stuff
that I love to do.

15:02.682 --> 15:04.983
I would miss that, very much.

15:05.018 --> 15:08.186
I mean, have I really pulled
my last bloated raccoon carcass

15:08.221 --> 15:09.388
from a public fountain?

15:09.422 --> 15:10.789
But that's the whole point

15:10.823 --> 15:13.325
of moving up the ladder,
you get to think bigger,

15:13.359 --> 15:15.127
swim in a bigger pond.

15:15.161 --> 15:17.329
You're having a public forum
on the slogan, right?

15:17.363 --> 15:18.897
Use it as a test.

15:18.931 --> 15:21.500
Hand the reins to someone else,
let them handle things

15:21.534 --> 15:23.268
while you manage
from a distance.

15:23.302 --> 15:24.603
Yeah. That's a good idea.

15:24.637 --> 15:28.340
I guess I should practice...
delegating.

15:28.374 --> 15:29.808
Ugh! Okay.

15:29.842 --> 15:33.578
The public forum
will be run by...

15:33.613 --> 15:35.881
Oh, no, I would not
have started the sentence

15:35.915 --> 15:37.849
if I knew Larry
was the only one here.

15:37.884 --> 15:40.619
Babe, if you can step back
and let Larry take control,

15:40.653 --> 15:42.487
you can survive anything.

15:42.522 --> 15:44.823
All right.
Larry, can you get in here?

15:44.857 --> 15:46.625
I would love to.
Gosh darn it.

15:46.659 --> 15:50.162
I-I somehow ran my belt through
a slat in this chair

15:50.196 --> 15:53.365
so I'm kind of...I'm kind
of stuck to it now.

15:55.635 --> 15:56.968
Great.

16:00.306 --> 16:02.547
You really shouldn't have dug
that out of the dumpster.

16:02.575 --> 16:04.976
I had to. Also I had a banana
on the way over here.

16:05.011 --> 16:06.478
Sorry.

16:06.512 --> 16:09.147
I get why you don't want any
more to know about Duke Silver,

16:09.182 --> 16:10.882
and you don't have to worry.

16:10.917 --> 16:12.751
You secret is safe with me.

16:12.785 --> 16:14.419
To even it out,

16:14.454 --> 16:16.588
I'm gonna tell you
all of my secrets.

16:16.622 --> 16:19.124
Oh, no, that's not necessary.

16:19.158 --> 16:21.326
I once forgot to brush
my teeth for five weeks.

16:21.361 --> 16:22.761
I didn't actually sell
my last car.

16:22.796 --> 16:24.036
I just forgot
where I parked it.

16:24.063 --> 16:25.497
I don't know who Al Gore is.

16:25.531 --> 16:27.032
And at this point
I'm too afraid to ask.

16:27.066 --> 16:28.467
When they say 2% milk,

16:28.501 --> 16:31.169
I don't know what
the other 98% is.

16:31.204 --> 16:32.671
When I was a baby,
my head was so big

16:32.705 --> 16:34.473
scientists did experiments
on me.

16:34.507 --> 16:35.641
I once threw beer at a swan,

16:35.675 --> 16:38.043
and then it attacked
my niece Rebecca.

16:38.077 --> 16:39.444
That'll do, Andrew.

16:39.479 --> 16:41.847
You don't have to play
the unity concert.

16:41.881 --> 16:44.950
But don't quit music.
Please.

16:50.957 --> 16:52.824
- Tommy.
- Hey.

16:52.859 --> 16:55.327
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

16:55.361 --> 16:56.962
I just got excited about
the restaurant

16:56.996 --> 16:58.497
but I should probably call
my investor

16:58.531 --> 17:00.465
and tell him we have a problem.

17:00.500 --> 17:02.667
Well, I got you something
to cheer you up.

17:02.702 --> 17:03.802
Watch cologne.

17:03.836 --> 17:05.069
Cologne for watches.

17:05.104 --> 17:06.070
Thanks.

17:06.105 --> 17:08.440
Things used to make me
so happy.

17:08.473 --> 17:11.542
But I've grown a lot
in the last year.

17:11.577 --> 17:13.345
Now I just want one big thing,

17:13.378 --> 17:15.213
my own restaurant,
named after me,

17:15.248 --> 17:17.749
that makes me so much money
I can buy anything I want.

17:18.345 --> 17:22.481
I should go.

17:22.515 --> 17:24.415
I didn't want Tom to leave,

17:24.451 --> 17:26.952
so I said all these bad things
about the restaurant,

17:26.987 --> 17:28.554
so he wouldn't like them.

17:28.588 --> 17:30.422
Damn, we should have
coordinated.

17:30.457 --> 17:32.417
I don't want to lose that
weird little elf either.

17:32.425 --> 17:34.305
That's why I showed him
all those crappy places.

17:34.327 --> 17:36.128
Oh, I thought you were
just bad at your job.

17:36.162 --> 17:39.064
Sorry.
What should we do?

17:39.099 --> 17:40.933
Let me call some people.

17:41.935 --> 17:44.270
Hello, everyone, and welcome

17:44.304 --> 17:46.972
to a public forum to choose
our new town slogan.

17:47.007 --> 17:50.209
I'm gonna hand things over
to Larry Gengurch,

17:50.243 --> 17:54.079
who is 100% in charge.

17:54.114 --> 17:55.648
Well, let's
just get started, huh?

17:55.682 --> 17:56.682
I want to talk about...

17:56.716 --> 17:59.285
Oh, it's the...
geez Louise...

17:59.319 --> 18:00.853
This keeps happening.
I don't know why.

18:00.887 --> 18:02.488
I think the slogan should be

18:02.522 --> 18:04.623
"Pawnee, home of crackers,

18:04.658 --> 18:07.626
the orangest goldfish
in Indiana."

18:07.661 --> 18:08.627
- Okey-dokey.
- No.

18:08.747 --> 18:09.668
Let me write it down.

18:09.678 --> 18:11.764
- Who even needs a slogan?
- Well, now,

18:11.798 --> 18:12.958
that is an interesting point.

18:13.042 --> 18:15.034
No, that's my slogan idea.

18:15.068 --> 18:16.302
"Who even needs a slogan?"

18:16.336 --> 18:19.138
And then a big picture of me
flipping everybody off.

18:19.172 --> 18:22.641
Let's keep our eye
on the ball here, Douche nation,

18:22.676 --> 18:26.512
"Home of the stick up Leslie
Knope's butt."

18:26.546 --> 18:27.813
Butt stick!

18:27.847 --> 18:29.081
Butt stick! Butt stick!

18:29.115 --> 18:30.349
Let's vote on it right now!

18:30.383 --> 18:32.751
Butt stick!
Butt stick!

18:33.927 --> 18:35.894
Okay. Who's next?
Yes, ma'am.

18:35.929 --> 18:39.230
This slogan is gonna go on
every sign in town.

18:39.350 --> 18:41.384
I think it should be
something real

18:41.419 --> 18:43.420
that we can all be proud of.

18:43.454 --> 18:45.121
I've lived in Pawnee
my whole life

18:45.156 --> 18:48.825
and it could be a strange place,
but overall it's a warm,

18:48.860 --> 18:50.230
and wonderful town.

18:50.350 --> 18:53.497
My idea for a slogan is,
"When you're here,

18:53.531 --> 18:55.031
then you're home."

18:55.066 --> 18:56.133
Well, that's lovely.

18:56.167 --> 18:57.367
I actually had it printed up

18:57.401 --> 18:58.802
so we can see what
it would look like.

18:58.836 --> 19:00.170
Oh, you...

19:00.204 --> 19:02.072
Hm...there's...that's...that's
spelled wrong.

19:02.106 --> 19:04.007
That should be "then",
t-h-e-n.

19:04.041 --> 19:05.976
Stay strong.
Let them work it out.

19:06.010 --> 19:07.344
And trust Larry.

19:07.378 --> 19:08.778
Trust Larry?

19:08.813 --> 19:10.013
Are you listening to yourself?

19:10.047 --> 19:11.515
I like that slogan a lot.

19:11.549 --> 19:14.951
But you made
a little mistake there.

19:16.320 --> 19:19.356
- You see?
- Back off.

19:19.390 --> 19:21.191
"You're" is spelled wrong.

19:21.225 --> 19:23.660
It should be "y-o-u-r."

19:23.694 --> 19:25.695
Oops, I didn't catch it.
Thank you.

19:25.730 --> 19:27.130
No, no, no,
she made a possessive.

19:27.131 --> 19:28.698
- She's getting further away.
- It's okay.

19:28.733 --> 19:30.167
Okay, let's vote.

19:30.201 --> 19:31.701
All those in favor.

19:33.004 --> 19:34.271
Approved!

19:38.609 --> 19:40.477
Man, the places that came
on the market today

19:40.511 --> 19:43.013
are way nicer than the listings
we saw yesterday.

19:43.047 --> 19:45.882
I know, crazy, right?
Real estate.

19:45.917 --> 19:47.384
This property
is under your budget,

19:47.418 --> 19:49.553
and it's got everything
on this wish list you gave me.

19:49.587 --> 19:51.054
Except the two helipads.

19:51.088 --> 19:52.322
Does it have one helipad?

19:52.356 --> 19:53.723
I don't know.

19:53.758 --> 19:56.493
I like it, but...seems
a little small.

19:56.527 --> 19:58.562
No, I think it just seems
small because

19:58.596 --> 20:00.063
of all the heavy furniture.

20:00.097 --> 20:01.765
But that part is really great.

20:01.799 --> 20:04.034
The lighting is really cool.

20:04.068 --> 20:06.436
I think this is the one.

20:06.471 --> 20:08.438
You know, I think you're right.

20:08.473 --> 20:09.506
I'll do it.

20:09.540 --> 20:10.907
Thanks, April.
And, hey, bonus,

20:10.942 --> 20:12.876
it's pretty close to city hall.

20:12.910 --> 20:14.177
You guys are gonna be regulars.

20:14.212 --> 20:16.046
I'll keep a table open for you.

20:16.080 --> 20:18.515
And special thanks
to Leslie Knope

20:18.549 --> 20:21.685
for once again bringing about
positive change to this town.

20:21.719 --> 20:24.955
Pawnee, I present to you,
your new slogan.

20:26.491 --> 20:27.958
You fixed the mistakes.

20:27.992 --> 20:30.060
I held it together
for the entire meeting.

20:30.094 --> 20:31.094
Let me have this one.

20:31.128 --> 20:33.363
I'm done micromanaging.
I promise.

20:33.397 --> 20:36.433
Then I'm sure you are okay
with the fact

20:36.467 --> 20:37.968
that they installed the sign

20:38.002 --> 20:40.237
the wrong way
and it's welcoming you to Pawnee

20:40.271 --> 20:41.338
as you're leaving.

20:41.372 --> 20:42.405
What?

20:42.440 --> 20:44.641
No! Oh, son of a...

20:44.675 --> 20:46.076
Hey, you passed the test.

20:46.110 --> 20:47.344
Honestly,

20:47.378 --> 20:49.246
there's something else
I'm worried about.

20:49.280 --> 20:51.047
The kind of work that I've been
doing all these years,

20:51.082 --> 20:52.949
the nuts and bolts,
the grunt work,

20:52.984 --> 20:54.651
that's the stuff I know
how to do.

20:54.685 --> 20:56.586
What if I take
this national parks jobs

20:56.621 --> 20:58.788
and I just...fail?

20:58.823 --> 21:00.891
- Hm.
- What if I'm not good at it?

21:00.925 --> 21:01.925
Yeah.

21:01.959 --> 21:05.896
Leslie, I love you, very much.

21:05.930 --> 21:07.998
But this is the stupidest
thing you've ever said.

21:08.032 --> 21:10.233
You'd be amazing.

21:10.268 --> 21:12.302
And everyone's gonna be in awe
of how amazing you are,

21:12.336 --> 21:13.737
so just shut your month.

21:16.307 --> 21:17.407
Hey,

21:17.441 --> 21:18.575
are we leaving or entering?

21:18.609 --> 21:21.511
We've been driving around
in circles.

21:21.546 --> 21:23.814
You're...
