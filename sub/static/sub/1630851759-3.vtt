19:48.471 --> 19:50.938
What? (scoffs)
I don't like-like her.

Ew, gross.

19:56.512 --> 19:59.480
You don't wanna
be my cousin-in-law?
Now, that hurts.

20:00.483 --> 20:02.283
Seriously? Will you stop?

20:02.368 --> 20:04.735
Fine. But only because
I gotta go apologize

Okay!
Tell her I say hi!

20:45.945 --> 20:48.362
Well, I went to the dance,

20:48.498 --> 20:50.998
stood there through half of
the first song, and thought...

20:51.868 --> 20:53.367
Why am I here without syd?

20:55.004 --> 20:56.454
So, I came over.

20:56.839 --> 20:58.039
Really?

21:00.910 --> 21:02.343
What about your friends?

21:02.428 --> 21:03.711
That was a lie.

21:05.014 --> 21:06.180
I went alone.

21:07.050 --> 21:09.267
I guess I was just hurt that
you didn't wanna hang with me.

21:09.352 --> 21:12.853
Well, I only said that 'cause
I was trying to play it cool.

21:13.523 --> 21:15.973
But I was only playing it cool
because you were
playing it cool.

21:16.059 --> 21:19.060
-So, neither of us are cool.
-Not even a little.

21:19.946 --> 21:22.697
I'm sorry, harry.
It's just that...

21:23.950 --> 21:26.150
When you said you
missed portland,

21:26.235 --> 21:29.036
I thought that meant
you didn't miss me.

21:30.773 --> 21:31.989
Syd.

21:33.943 --> 21:35.326
I missed you every day.

21:36.996 --> 21:38.129
Really?

21:38.965 --> 21:41.749
So, does that mean you
still like-like me?

21:43.786 --> 21:45.419
Would I bring...

21:45.505 --> 21:48.055
A string of stale pasta
halfway around the world

21:48.141 --> 21:50.174
if I didn't like-like you?

21:58.067 --> 22:00.067
Let's make a pact never
to play games again.

22:00.153 --> 22:01.268
Deal.

22:06.326 --> 22:10.111

you a dance, huh?

"of course I wanna
hang with you, bud!"

-I know that now, bud.

22:35.221 --> 22:37.138
it was my bad, buds.

you this homemade

Oh, I forgot the forks.

I'll even bring one for you,
randy, but no pressure.

Just take one bite, make some
yummy noises, move it around,

22:49.185 --> 22:50.951
and then dump it
in the bathroom
when she's not looking.

22:51.037 --> 22:53.320
You'll find granola bars
taped behind the tv,

22:53.406 --> 22:55.406
under the kitchen sink,
and...

22:56.325 --> 22:57.908
Wait, where did we
put those other two?

22:58.745 --> 22:59.827
I don't remember.

-Don't overdo it, harry.

No, syd,
this is really delicious.

23:14.477 --> 23:15.926
Where'd you get this recipe?

23:16.012 --> 23:17.928
Actually,
sydney's mom, alisha,

23:18.014 --> 23:19.980
taught me how to cook it
when she was about your age.

So, I guess you won't be
needing the granola bars

hidden under the stairs
in the girl cave, huh?
