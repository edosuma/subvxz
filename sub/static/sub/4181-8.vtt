[DOOR BUZZES]

47:26.093 --> 47:28.379
This your deal for Lucious?
I want my lawyer here.

47:28.554 --> 47:29.930
Open it.

47:36.229 --> 47:37.685
What is this?

47:37.855 --> 47:40.562
Trying to do right by your kid?
I wanna do right by these.

47:40.733 --> 47:42.689
I am doing the right thing.
You're not.

47:42.860 --> 47:45.602
You're too proud, too stupid
to do the right thing.

47:45.780 --> 47:48.362
If you cared about these kids,
you'd tell me the truth.

47:48.533 --> 47:51.320
I ain't saying another word to you
without my lawyer.

47:51.494 --> 47:53.359
You don't need a lawyer.

47:53.538 --> 47:56.200
Toric killed Erin Byrne.

47:59.794 --> 48:01.876
You hold on to these.

48:02.046 --> 48:05.129
And you think about them
every time you visit Lucious.

48:05.299 --> 48:09.884
And know that if we believe in
the same god, debts will be paid.

48:14.892 --> 48:16.553
He's free to go.

[CHUCKLES]

48:59.770 --> 49:01.852
DO you ever regret it?

49:06.110 --> 49:07.771
Coming back?

49:17.955 --> 49:20.492
A lot of things I'd do differently.

[SIGHS]

49:24.420 --> 49:25.910
Butno.

49:28.341 --> 49:30.548
He makes it all worth it.

49:32.261 --> 49:33.592
DO you?

49:42.063 --> 49:46.056
Sometimes I wish
you'd come back five years sooner.

49:51.405 --> 49:53.691
Or five years later.

50:00.414 --> 50:02.951
I'm lost here, Tara.

50:03.959 --> 50:06.826
I'm trying to put it back together...

50:10.591 --> 50:12.673
...but I don't know if I can.

50:16.097 --> 50:17.553
I know.

50:30.986 --> 50:34.228
| just feel so far away from you now.

50:37.493 --> 50:39.905
I know that's my fault.

50:44.417 --> 50:47.580
Please just tell me, how do | get back?

50:55.010 --> 50:56.841
I'm not sure.

51:02.184 --> 51:03.765
Babe.

51:07.106 --> 51:09.563
Please let me back in.
