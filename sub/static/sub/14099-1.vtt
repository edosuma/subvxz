04:13.411 --> 04:15.704
There's just nothing down there.

04:15.913 --> 04:19.207
I haven't seen a building
in, like, 20 minutes.

04:19.834 --> 04:22.961
- Look at that.
- We're not on vacation, Hap.

04:23.212 --> 04:25.297
Cheer up, will you?

04:25.506 --> 04:27.507
Tell that to her, partner.

04:28.217 --> 04:30.218
Better hang on, guys.
It's gonna get rough.

04:32.054 --> 04:34.556
- Ooh.
- There goes my lunch.

05:07.340 --> 05:09.799
Detective Eckhart,
I'm Detective Ellie Burr.

05:09.967 --> 05:12.260
- Hi.
Nice to meet you.

05:12.428 --> 05:13.720
How are you doing?
Good.

05:13.888 --> 05:16.348
"Halibut fishing capital
of the world. " Okay.

05:16.974 --> 05:19.893
Detective Dormer,
it's an honor to meet you.

05:20.061 --> 05:23.313
Welcome to Nightmute.
I got the car right here.

05:36.202 --> 05:39.454
It's so incredible
to be working with you.

05:39.622 --> 05:44.543
I've followed all of your cases:
Theodore Dineli, Frank Prud'homme...

05:44.752 --> 05:50.340
...the Ocean Park shootings and
especially the Leland Street murders.

05:50.550 --> 05:54.886
Is that where Ronald Langley cut you,
at 325 Leland Street?

05:55.054 --> 05:56.763
You did your homework.

05:56.931 --> 06:00.809
The Leland Street murders was
my case study at the academy.

06:00.977 --> 06:05.397
- I'll take you to the Lodge and...
- No, take us to the station.

06:05.815 --> 06:08.024
Right. We need to get started.

06:08.234 --> 06:11.653
Most homicides are solved
in the first 72 hours.

06:11.821 --> 06:15.657
Well, it's 48 hours.
We're a day behind.

06:15.825 --> 06:17.867
But who's counting?

06:28.170 --> 06:29.421
Yeah, come in.

06:29.589 --> 06:34.134
They got you behind a desk, huh?
Charlie Bubbles. How you doing?

06:34.343 --> 06:38.013
- I haven't seen you since when?
- Hey, Charlie.

06:38.180 --> 06:39.764
- Seven years?
- Eight.

06:39.932 --> 06:44.394
Seven years! I am old.
Ellie, get everyone in the bullpen.

06:44.854 --> 06:48.690
- Nice kid.
- Loves the job. Heh.

06:48.858 --> 06:54.696
When I called Buck for advice on this,
I never expected he'd send you up here.

06:55.656 --> 06:59.743
- Something about Internal Affairs?
- They're moving in.

06:59.910 --> 07:04.956
It's nothing. It's the usual crap.
Buck figured you could use some help...

07:05.124 --> 07:07.709
They got Finn and Kentor on Narcotics.

07:07.877 --> 07:10.420
The fuckers are looking
for headlines...

07:10.588 --> 07:14.841
- It's gonna blow over.
- Got a message from Warfield.

07:15.009 --> 07:16.593
I.A.'s pit bull.

07:16.761 --> 07:19.929
He wants to be posted
on your movements.

07:20.306 --> 07:22.724
You'll find us more straightforward.

07:22.892 --> 07:27.896
Good guys, bad guys, but a lot
less public relations. It's simple.

07:29.732 --> 07:31.900
Except for this.

07:32.485 --> 07:36.571
Ahem. Okay, listen up.
Detectives Dormer and Eckhart...

07:36.739 --> 07:39.824
...on loan from Buck Lundgard,
L.A. Homicide.

07:39.992 --> 07:42.285
- They'll help with the Connell case.
- Help?

07:42.495 --> 07:45.121
Anything they want to see, show them.

07:45.289 --> 07:47.540
Anyplace they want to go, take them.

07:47.708 --> 07:49.000
This is Fred Duggar.

07:49.168 --> 07:51.211
- He's heading the investigation.
Hello, Fred.

07:51.379 --> 07:53.421
A pleasure.
- Want to get on it?

07:53.589 --> 07:56.049
- Seen what we got?
- Let's start with the body.

07:56.217 --> 07:59.135
- You got the report?
- I want to see the body for myself.

07:59.929 --> 08:01.262
Okay.

08:01.722 --> 08:05.684
Herniation of the brain stem
due to intracerebral hemorrhage.

08:05.851 --> 08:09.437
- Beaten to death.
- These contusions?

08:09.605 --> 08:14.109
Superficial. Most of the trauma
was to her face and neck.

08:15.319 --> 08:17.779
Any signs of rape?
No.

08:17.947 --> 08:22.450
- This one covers an older bruise.
- There's an older one here.

08:22.618 --> 08:26.538
- They're both in the report.
- He washed her hair.

08:32.419 --> 08:34.254
Scrubbed her nails.

08:35.756 --> 08:37.716
It's all in the report.

08:37.883 --> 08:41.970
- Doesn't say he clipped them.
- She could have clipped them.

08:42.138 --> 08:45.682
Nope. No polish on the ends
of the nails. See?

08:46.183 --> 08:51.271
She painted them herself.
Someone else cut them. Toes too.

08:52.732 --> 08:56.609
Naked when found?
Yeah. Last seen wearing a red dress.

08:56.777 --> 08:58.695
No fibers, flakes, hairs?

08:58.863 --> 09:03.074
We know about forensics work here.
The body gave us nothing.

09:03.242 --> 09:09.581
She gave us plenty.
All this trouble, all this care. Why?

09:11.751 --> 09:16.546
He knew her.
- He knows we can connect him to her.

09:16.714 --> 09:19.674
This isn't a random psycho?
Crime of passion?

09:19.842 --> 09:25.305
Maybe. But whatever happened,
his reaction wasn't passionate.

09:25.473 --> 09:28.850
He didn't panic.
Didn't chop her up or burn her.

09:29.018 --> 09:32.937
He just thought about
what we would be looking for...

09:33.105 --> 09:37.275
...and then calmly removed
all those traces.

09:37.443 --> 09:40.528
No haste. No rush.

09:40.696 --> 09:43.865
Why clip the nails
after scrubbing them?

09:44.033 --> 09:47.368
Manipulating the body.
Prolonging the moment.

09:47.536 --> 09:49.621
No mutilation.

09:50.080 --> 09:51.372
Not this time.

09:51.832 --> 09:55.210
- You think there's been others?
- No.

09:56.545 --> 09:59.130
But there's gonna be. This guy...

09:59.590 --> 10:03.885
...he crossed the line
and he didn't even blink.

10:04.678 --> 10:07.180
You don't come back from that.

10:07.723 --> 10:12.769
Okay. Let's go find out who Kay was.

10:15.731 --> 10:19.734
Fred said not to touch anything,
so I haven't tidied up.

10:19.944 --> 10:23.530
She hates it when I go
into her room anyway.

10:25.241 --> 10:27.575
Thank you, Mrs. Connell.

10:36.919 --> 10:39.671
So she went to a party Friday night.

10:39.839 --> 10:44.592
Not exactly a party. It's a local dive
where the kids hang out.

10:44.760 --> 10:45.969
No diary?

10:46.136 --> 10:49.639
We didn't find one.
Her mom said she has a journal.

10:49.807 --> 10:53.351
Friends said she argued
with her boyfriend Friday.

10:53.519 --> 10:56.437
She stormed offjust after midnight.

10:57.231 --> 10:58.940
She did, huh?

10:59.984 --> 11:02.151
This is interesting.

11:14.373 --> 11:16.374
Who is this?

11:16.584 --> 11:19.961
Tanya Francke, Kay's best friend.

11:20.379 --> 11:22.589
I want to talk to her.

11:22.840 --> 11:28.845
Who is Kay Connell? Who is she?
Is she popular or is she a loner?

11:29.054 --> 11:33.224
Did she like this town?
She want to bolt first chance she got?

11:33.392 --> 11:35.226
Did she have dreams?

11:35.436 --> 11:39.230
She knew this guy.
We know her, maybe we can know him.

11:39.440 --> 11:42.567
This is designer. This is expensive.

11:43.736 --> 11:46.487
- The boyfriend, Randy.
- Randy Stetz.

11:46.655 --> 11:49.157
- He could afford this?
- He's in school.

11:49.325 --> 11:51.534
- Mom didn't buy it.
- What are we thinking?

11:51.702 --> 11:55.038
I don't know, stepfather?
Any rich uncles?

11:55.205 --> 11:56.539
No.

11:58.500 --> 12:00.001
An admirer.

12:01.837 --> 12:03.504
Yeah.

12:04.506 --> 12:08.468
- Tsk. I want the boyfriend.
- I'll get him to the station.

12:08.636 --> 12:12.597
I want to go to the school.
Pull him out in front of friends.

12:12.765 --> 12:16.517
Catch him off guard.
It will get people talking.

12:16.685 --> 12:19.687
So how far away is the school?

12:22.316 --> 12:26.235
- It's 10:00, Detective Dormer.
- You bet.

12:26.737 --> 12:28.738
At night.

12:29.406 --> 12:32.575
Oh. So when does it get dark here?

12:32.743 --> 12:34.994
It doesn't. Heh.

12:35.162 --> 12:37.413
Not this time of year.

12:38.666 --> 12:41.918
Yeah, I heard about that.
How come you didn't know that, Hap?

12:50.344 --> 12:53.137
- Lower 48.
- Lower 48?

12:53.305 --> 12:55.765
Not from here.
Can tell by your walk.

12:56.183 --> 12:58.559
- How's that?
- Unsure.

12:58.727 --> 13:00.520
- Ah.
- Dormer and Eckhart.

13:00.688 --> 13:01.771
We have a reservation.

13:01.939 --> 13:06.651
Don't be fooled by my friend's
frivolous demeanor. He's all business.

13:07.736 --> 13:11.572
- Your restaurant still serving?
- Kitchen's about to close.

13:12.032 --> 13:14.117
We'll be quick. Thank you.

13:14.576 --> 13:15.576
Thanks.

13:16.412 --> 13:20.748
We got the Halibut Calabrese,
got the Halibut Olympian.

13:20.916 --> 13:23.292
- Keep going.
- Halibut Cajun style.

13:23.460 --> 13:26.754
I can't wait to see
what they got for dessert.

13:28.757 --> 13:30.800
Natives are getting restless.

13:30.968 --> 13:33.720
- We gotta talk.
- No, we don't.

13:33.887 --> 13:36.139
- Just sit tight?
- Nothing's changed.

13:36.306 --> 13:37.515
Nothing's changed?

13:37.683 --> 13:42.437
What do you think we're doing
in the halibut capital of the world?

13:42.604 --> 13:44.647
Buck figured Charlie needed help.

13:44.815 --> 13:49.527
Buck figured I.A. would be coming
to me next, and he was right.

13:50.738 --> 13:54.574
Warfield had me in his office
for three hours yesterday.

13:55.284 --> 13:59.287
Hap, he's rattling your cage, pal.
That's all.

13:59.455 --> 14:04.959
Me and Trish talked it through,
and I'm sorry, I gotta cut a deal.

14:05.127 --> 14:08.629
- Don't say this shit to me.
- You won't be involved.

14:08.797 --> 14:10.798
I'm not? Of course I will.

14:10.966 --> 14:13.676
With your reputation,
he can't touch you.

14:13.844 --> 14:16.596
My reputation's the whole problem.

14:18.599 --> 14:23.936
You think Warfield gives a fuck
about you shaking down drug dealers?

14:24.104 --> 14:28.566
You think that will get him
his headlines? He needs the big fish.

14:28.734 --> 14:31.986
He's putting the squeeze
on you to get to me.

14:32.154 --> 14:35.865
- But you're clean, Will.
- I'm a good cop, yeah.

14:36.033 --> 14:41.412
But there's always something they
could use to get at your credibility.

14:41.580 --> 14:44.165
Have you any idea
what this is gonna do?

14:44.374 --> 14:49.670
Think about all my cases. All the cases
dependent on my word, my judgment.

14:49.838 --> 14:53.424
Those fuckers on the street.
That's what you're doing.

14:53.592 --> 14:57.136
They got nothing on you
because there's nothing to get.

14:57.679 --> 14:59.430
Dobbs.

15:01.558 --> 15:04.018
- What about Dobbs?
- That's different.

15:04.186 --> 15:05.436
It's different?

15:05.646 --> 15:08.397
Warfield doesn't want
Dobbs on the street.

15:08.607 --> 15:13.528
It's a house of cards. Once it starts,
it's just gonna tumble. All of it.

15:13.695 --> 15:16.197
That's a chance I gotta take, pal.

15:16.615 --> 15:18.991
- I got family.
- Don't give me that.

15:19.159 --> 15:22.120
Warfield made it clear.
I get probation.

15:22.287 --> 15:26.415
We're cops, man.
This is not about us.

15:26.708 --> 15:31.170
This is about all the people who
depend on us. People with families.

15:31.713 --> 15:34.507
I spent my life doing this. My life.

15:34.675 --> 15:39.428
You're gonna destroy it like that.
Why? Why?

15:39.596 --> 15:43.307
So some I.A. prick gets closer
to being chief of police?

15:43.475 --> 15:49.063
Or playing golf with the mayor
or whatever the fuck else he's after?

15:49.481 --> 15:51.524
You finished?

15:54.528 --> 15:57.071
Sorry, I gotta cut a deal.

15:59.366 --> 16:01.576
So, make any decisions?

16:01.910 --> 16:03.995
Uh... You do everything around here?

16:04.163 --> 16:07.081
After 11, pretty much.

16:07.624 --> 16:10.334
Over to you, Will.
What are you having?

16:17.551 --> 16:19.969
I lost my appetite.

16:24.600 --> 16:26.559
Excuse me.

16:49.958 --> 16:51.250
Morning.

16:51.960 --> 16:53.419
Hi.

17:07.726 --> 17:13.314
- What kind of calls you get here?
- Mostly drinking-related problems.

17:13.482 --> 17:17.276
Domestic abuse, bar fights,
that sort of stuff.

17:17.444 --> 17:21.113
People here come to live
the way they want to...

17:21.281 --> 17:23.741
...so most people keep to themselves.

17:24.034 --> 17:27.787
Chief won't let me handle anything
over a misdemeanor.

17:27.954 --> 17:29.705
Don't knock misdemeanors.

17:29.873 --> 17:33.084
No, but it's such small stuff.
It's so boring.

17:33.252 --> 17:37.755
It's all about small stuff.
You know, small lies, small mistakes.

17:37.923 --> 17:43.803
People give themselves away same
in misdemeanors as in murder cases.

17:43.971 --> 17:48.557
It's just human nature.
Aren't you gonna write that down?

18:11.456 --> 18:14.917
Friends making you nervous?
They think you did it?

18:16.253 --> 18:18.045
You killed her?

18:18.213 --> 18:22.216
- No smoking on the school premises.
- Did you love her?

18:24.011 --> 18:27.638
- Randy, did you love her?
- Sure, she was nice.

18:27.806 --> 18:32.935
She was nice. Wow.
That makes me all soft inside.

18:33.103 --> 18:35.688
Did it occur to you
she didn't love you?

18:35.856 --> 18:37.773
She loved me.

18:37.941 --> 18:41.402
- Wanted me every night.
- Oh. Probably to pass the time.

18:41.570 --> 18:47.575
Girl like Kay Connell, she was looking
for more than some loser. Right?

18:47.909 --> 18:49.952
What can I say? Love is blind.

18:50.120 --> 18:51.912
- Live on your own?
- His grandpa's.

18:52.080 --> 18:55.041
- No alibi for Friday?
- Didn't know I'd need one.

18:55.208 --> 18:58.836
- At the party what'd you fight about?
- Stuff. No big deal.

18:59.046 --> 19:02.256
- I heard it was a loud fight.
- I guess.

19:02.424 --> 19:05.676
- I heard it was pretty rough.
- It wasn't rough.

19:05.844 --> 19:10.931
Not like the other times.
Those times she wouldn't listen to you.

19:11.099 --> 19:13.351
Couldn't keep her mouth shut.

19:13.518 --> 19:16.979
- Keep fishing, man.
We saw the bruises.

19:17.147 --> 19:19.231
They said she was beaten.

19:19.399 --> 19:23.569
Not those bruises. Come on.
The old bruises. Your bruises.

19:23.779 --> 19:27.198
I'm sick of this.
I haven't done anything wrong.

19:27.366 --> 19:28.949
You haven't?

19:30.410 --> 19:31.410
Fuck you!

19:31.578 --> 19:35.706
You're a prick in a leather jacket.
What the fuck do you know?

19:36.750 --> 19:38.125
Randy...

19:44.549 --> 19:48.302
...this whole thing you're doing,
this fuck-the-world act.

19:48.470 --> 19:52.681
It might work with your mom.
It might even work with local cops...

19:52.849 --> 19:56.435
...who know you enough to figure
you're too dumb to kill...

19:56.645 --> 20:00.523
...without leaving witnesses
and a signed confession.

20:00.690 --> 20:03.150
It ain't gonna work with me.

20:03.610 --> 20:08.364
Because I know things. You understand?

20:08.532 --> 20:12.243
I know you beat your girlfriend.

20:12.411 --> 20:15.162
I know she was seeing somebody else.

20:15.455 --> 20:21.460
Someone she might have gone to see
after she walked out on you Friday.

20:21.628 --> 20:25.798
Now are you gonna tell us
who that somebody might be?

20:25.966 --> 20:28.843
Or are you so fucking stupid...

20:29.052 --> 20:34.723
...you're gonna leave yourself as the
last person to see Kay Connell alive?

20:38.270 --> 20:39.603
I don't know.

20:39.813 --> 20:41.564
You don't know.

20:42.023 --> 20:44.150
I couldn't get her to tell me.

20:54.202 --> 20:56.120
How hard did you try?

20:57.539 --> 20:59.665
Pretty hard.

21:18.018 --> 21:19.894
- You think he...
- No.

21:20.061 --> 21:22.438
How'd it go?
Find where this is from.

21:22.647 --> 21:25.566
Mrs. Connell and her
friends don't know.

21:25.775 --> 21:30.404
You try the jewelry stores?
Small things, remember?

21:30.572 --> 21:34.742
The second you're about to dismiss
something, think about it.

21:34.910 --> 21:37.077
Look at it again.

21:38.288 --> 21:40.581
Want me to write that down?

21:40.790 --> 21:41.874
No, I'll remember it.

21:44.544 --> 21:45.586
Ellie Burr.

21:53.887 --> 21:56.388
- Where was it?
In a cabin on the beach.

21:56.556 --> 21:58.766
- It's definitely Kay's?
Her books are in it.

21:58.934 --> 22:00.726
Kids found it.
- Cabin secured?

22:00.894 --> 22:03.145
Francis is headed there.
Stop him.

22:03.313 --> 22:05.564
- Tell him to stay clear.
Rich.

22:05.732 --> 22:08.275
Biology and Algebra.

22:08.443 --> 22:12.988
Let's find out who she studied with,
where she bought this.

22:15.033 --> 22:18.160
"Otherwise Engaged.
A J. Brody mystery. "

22:18.328 --> 22:20.454
- Who reads this crap?
- I do.

22:20.622 --> 22:23.332
Read it. After it's dusted.

22:23.500 --> 22:28.045
Find anything that strikes you,
plot-wise, underlined passages.

22:28.213 --> 22:29.797
There it is. The diary.

22:29.965 --> 22:31.215
Every word.

22:34.469 --> 22:35.469
That's it.

22:35.637 --> 22:37.513
- I'll put it in evidence.
- No.

22:37.681 --> 22:38.973
Why?

22:39.140 --> 22:42.601
Call every radio station
from here to Anchorage.

22:42.769 --> 22:47.189
Tell them we're looking for
the bag Kay left the party with.

22:47.357 --> 22:50.818
- Get it on the air in the next hour.
- You got it.

22:50.986 --> 22:54.405
Fill that bag up with books
and put it back.

22:55.615 --> 23:00.035
Gonna eat this son of a bitch alive,
knowing he missed this.

23:03.206 --> 23:07.751
You know something, Charlie?
Maybe this isn't such a hot idea.

23:08.086 --> 23:11.005
A guy picks up a bag,
don't make him guilty.

23:11.172 --> 23:12.381
Will, it's solid.

23:12.549 --> 23:17.803
I don't know. This kind of thing.
Maybe we do this by the numbers.

23:17.971 --> 23:20.598
- Come on.
- I.A.'s gonna be on my ass.

23:20.765 --> 23:25.477
I don't want this turning up in some
court when my rep's in the shit...

23:25.645 --> 23:28.689
...and they're pulling apart my cases.
- Bullshit.

23:28.857 --> 23:31.525
What the fuck you care?!

23:36.698 --> 23:40.117
Someone beat a girl to death.
Your job is to find him.

23:40.285 --> 23:44.913
You're a cop, not a lawyer.
Don't let I.A. cut your balls off.

23:45.206 --> 23:47.791
Charlie's right, Will.

24:07.187 --> 24:10.147
OP 1, this is OP 2.
We still got nothing.

24:10.523 --> 24:12.358
Yeah, it's nice. Light.

24:12.525 --> 24:15.819
All plastic except for the barrel.
Never rusts.

24:16.196 --> 24:18.322
What do you carry down in L.A.?

24:18.490 --> 24:20.616
- Smith & Wesson. 45.
- Excellent.

24:20.784 --> 24:22.743
Anything?
No.

24:30.377 --> 24:36.048
- Maybe he doesn't listen to the radio.
- He prefers the voices in his head.

24:38.301 --> 24:39.885
Hey, Will?

24:51.064 --> 24:53.941
We have somebody moving
towards the cabin.

24:54.109 --> 24:57.486
Okay, fan out. Nice and easy.

25:06.496 --> 25:07.579
Come on, go!

25:28.101 --> 25:29.309
Police!

25:30.478 --> 25:33.063
Police! Come out!

25:42.574 --> 25:43.782
Fuck!

25:44.909 --> 25:47.244
Down there, huh?

25:48.329 --> 25:50.497
Down to the water. Spread out!

25:50.665 --> 25:51.832
Go!

25:54.794 --> 25:56.086
Fuck it.

26:39.964 --> 26:41.340
Dormer!

26:56.064 --> 26:57.439
Hold it! Who's there?

27:01.361 --> 27:03.237
You okay?
- I'm okay.

28:36.831 --> 28:39.166
- Will?
- Don't talk.

28:39.417 --> 28:41.460
- Will.
- Don't talk. Don't talk.

28:41.961 --> 28:44.254
- Here.
- You sh...

28:44.422 --> 28:45.631
You...

28:46.341 --> 28:47.758
You shot...

28:47.926 --> 28:52.012
I know. I couldn't see, Hap.
I couldn't see in the fog.

28:52.847 --> 28:54.306
You tried to...

28:54.474 --> 28:57.142
You tried to kill me? Fuck you.

28:57.852 --> 28:59.186
No, listen, Hap.

28:59.354 --> 29:03.315
- Listen to me now. No, no.
- Get away, get away!

29:03.483 --> 29:07.027
No, I couldn't see you in the fog.
I couldn't. I...

29:07.528 --> 29:09.571
I couldn't see you, Hap.

29:10.990 --> 29:12.366
Don't go. Come on.

29:32.720 --> 29:35.639
- Man down!
Who's down?

29:38.726 --> 29:43.063
- Man down here!
Spread out!

29:47.235 --> 29:50.988
Dormer! Where'd he go? Which way?

29:51.739 --> 29:54.241
Dormer! Which way?

29:54.993 --> 29:56.284
That way.

29:57.412 --> 29:58.745
Fuck.

30:07.630 --> 30:09.756
Farrell went down.

30:09.924 --> 30:11.758
You gave chase.

30:11.926 --> 30:16.888
After you left Farrell,
you heard the killer's second shot.

30:17.056 --> 30:20.851
You ran down to the water.
You found Hap.

30:22.770 --> 30:23.854
Will?

30:24.689 --> 30:26.815
Is that what happened?

30:29.777 --> 30:31.653
- Did Hap say anything?
- Damn it!

30:31.821 --> 30:35.073
Why didn't I know about
the goddamn tunnel?

30:36.409 --> 30:39.953
You don't move on a suspect
without knowing his exits.

30:40.121 --> 30:43.123
There's a bunch of those
tunnels out there.

30:43.291 --> 30:45.834
Closed years ago
when they were mines.

30:46.002 --> 30:50.964
- I don't even know most of them myself.
- I had him, Charlie.

30:51.966 --> 30:54.468
As close as you are now.

30:54.802 --> 30:57.679
I could smell the son of a bitch.

30:59.807 --> 31:03.477
- And I blew it.
- There's no point in blaming yourself.

31:04.312 --> 31:08.815
- I fucked up everything.
- Don't come apart on me, understand?

31:08.983 --> 31:11.068
I need you to find this bastard.

31:12.653 --> 31:13.987
Yeah.

31:15.323 --> 31:18.950
You wanted to see me?
- You're on Eckhart's shooting.

31:19.118 --> 31:23.121
But we know what happened,
and I'm on the Connell case.

31:23.289 --> 31:27.834
Anchorage wants to send someone.
I told them we can do it. Can't we?

31:28.127 --> 31:30.837
- Sure.
- Write it up. No Shakespeare.

31:31.130 --> 31:35.008
Just enough to fry this
son of a bitch longer. Right?

31:51.400 --> 31:52.943
Hello?

31:53.361 --> 31:59.950
Uh... Jenny, it's Will.
Can you put your mother on?

32:02.995 --> 32:04.329
Hello?

32:04.956 --> 32:07.833
Trish, it's Will.

32:08.000 --> 32:12.295
What's happened?
They won't tell me anything.

32:12.463 --> 32:13.964
It's Hap...

32:15.716 --> 32:17.759
Is he okay?

32:19.846 --> 32:22.097
No, he's gone, Trish.

32:22.265 --> 32:23.723
He's dead.

32:24.892 --> 32:26.226
What?

32:30.857 --> 32:33.733
Trish, I can't tell you
how sorry I am.

32:33.901 --> 32:37.070
What was he doing, Will?

32:37.238 --> 32:42.492
This guy killed a girl, and, so we...

32:43.744 --> 32:45.620
We had him...

32:45.830 --> 32:50.333
We found him and we had him cornered.
And then he ran and...

32:50.543 --> 32:52.210
Hap...

32:54.005 --> 32:56.089
I'm so sorry.

32:56.382 --> 32:58.925
- I'm just so sorry.
- Did he suffer?

33:00.344 --> 33:04.639
- No, I don't...
- Did he say anything?

33:10.271 --> 33:14.774
Well, when I found him he...

33:15.651 --> 33:17.235
He was peaceful.

33:18.529 --> 33:22.449
- Did you get him?
- No, no. Not yet.

33:22.617 --> 33:24.784
You find him.

33:25.244 --> 33:28.246
And when you do, don't arrest him.

33:28.873 --> 33:31.833
You understand me, Will Dormer?

33:32.001 --> 33:34.878
Don't you dare fucking arrest him!

33:35.546 --> 33:38.632
- Okay, Trish.
- You understand?

33:38.799 --> 33:40.133
Okay.

33:42.595 --> 33:45.388
Trish, listen. I'm...

35:03.342 --> 35:06.344
- was shot and killed this evening...

35:06.512 --> 35:10.056
...in an attempt to apprehend
a suspect in the murder...

35:10.224 --> 35:13.893
...of 17-year-old
local girl, Kay Connell.

35:15.271 --> 35:18.440
I'm sorry. It's been
on the radio for hours.

35:19.150 --> 35:22.235
We're not used to this
kind of stuff up here.

35:24.280 --> 35:28.575
He was standing right there.
Last night.

35:31.329 --> 35:33.580
I hope I was nice to him.

35:33.914 --> 35:35.874
He liked you.

37:47.673 --> 37:51.759
Detective? I'm sorry to bother you,
but could you just point...

37:51.969 --> 37:55.597
...to where you were
when you heard the second shot?

37:56.182 --> 37:58.933
Sorry to make you do this right now.

37:59.101 --> 38:01.895
That's all right.
You're doing your job.

38:02.062 --> 38:03.229
Where was I?

38:04.064 --> 38:05.190
- There.
Thank you.

38:05.399 --> 38:08.485
No sign of Farrell's bullet yet, huh?

38:08.652 --> 38:12.030
No, we'll have the other
one for ballistics after...

38:12.490 --> 38:14.616
...the autopsy.

38:16.243 --> 38:18.328
I'm really sorry.

38:23.918 --> 38:25.084
How are you doing?

38:25.252 --> 38:27.170
- Clean through, huh?
- Yeah.

38:27.338 --> 38:30.048
No souvenir.
Bullet got lost in the rocks, I guess.

38:30.257 --> 38:33.134
Well, better luck next time.

38:33.761 --> 38:35.094
You ever been shot?

38:35.262 --> 38:38.223
Yeah, I have.
Kind of itches, don't it?

38:39.517 --> 38:42.685
We gotta catch him.
Did you get a look at him?

38:43.270 --> 38:45.980
- When?
- When I left you.

38:46.148 --> 38:49.067
- You see anything?
- I was in a lot of pain...

38:49.235 --> 38:53.821
...and when I heard that second shot,
I kept my goddamn head down.

38:54.031 --> 38:55.615
Hey, I'm...

38:56.200 --> 38:58.284
...sorry about Detective Eckhart.

38:58.452 --> 39:00.662
Sorry about that megaphone.

39:01.121 --> 39:03.790
- Maybe if I hadn't...
- Farrell, listen.

39:03.999 --> 39:07.085
What were we doing
running around in the fog?

39:07.628 --> 39:11.256
We doing it for our health?
We were chasing someone.

39:11.799 --> 39:15.885
So anything that happened
on that beach is not your fault.

39:16.095 --> 39:19.264
That's the fault of one man
and one man only.

39:19.473 --> 39:22.850
And that's the man who beat
Kay Connell to death.

39:29.316 --> 39:32.110
At this point, Dormer
encountered Brooks.

39:32.278 --> 39:35.863
The suspect, obscured by fog,
shot Officer Brooks...

39:36.031 --> 39:38.700
...in the vastus externus
of the left thigh.

39:38.867 --> 39:41.744
Francis, you're Farrell.
You were shot in the leg.

39:41.912 --> 39:43.079
Come on, Ellie.

39:43.247 --> 39:45.331
When you get this,
get the cone.

39:47.001 --> 39:49.335
- This his blood?
- Ketchup maybe.

39:49.545 --> 39:51.045
Was he eating a hot dog?

39:56.760 --> 40:00.346
Anything he dropped or stepped on...

40:00.514 --> 40:01.556
...you put in a bag.

40:01.724 --> 40:05.602
Cigarette butts, gum wrappers,
coins, anything.

40:05.769 --> 40:08.813
Suspect will often
leave something behind.

40:09.732 --> 40:11.691
Detective Dormer gave chase...

40:11.859 --> 40:15.528
...lost the suspect in the fog
then heard a shot...

40:15.696 --> 40:18.364
...coming from
a northeasterly direction.

40:19.199 --> 40:21.701
- He wasn't that way.
How do you know?

40:21.869 --> 40:23.911
Because I saw him.

40:24.872 --> 40:27.540
- Turn this way.
Are we almost done here?

40:27.833 --> 40:29.667
My nads are freezing off.

40:29.835 --> 40:32.670
Ellie! I think I found something.

40:33.839 --> 40:36.174
Should they start further over?
- No. Waste of time

40:36.342 --> 40:39.093
He stayed by the water
far as he could.

40:39.303 --> 40:43.514
I saw him over the rocks.
He knew he'd lose us down there.

40:47.102 --> 40:48.227
Duggar.

40:49.396 --> 40:51.397
Where'd he find it?

40:51.649 --> 40:52.899
Okay.

40:53.817 --> 40:56.361
Yeah, well, just let me know.

40:57.988 --> 40:59.322
Okay.

40:59.823 --> 41:01.199
I will.

41:05.412 --> 41:06.871
Dormer?

41:07.623 --> 41:11.334
They found Farrell's bullet.
Looks like a. 38.

41:11.752 --> 41:14.754
We'll get both bullets to the lab.

41:14.963 --> 41:18.966
See if we can get a fix on the weapon.
If it's okay with you.

41:21.929 --> 41:24.472
A guy came by.
Said he was your new partner.

41:24.848 --> 41:26.557
- Did he leave a name?
- No.

41:27.434 --> 41:28.601
Can I borrow this? Thank you.

41:30.729 --> 41:33.022
- Pioneer Lodge.
Warfield for Dormer.

41:33.190 --> 41:35.900
John Warfield.
He's called a couple times.

41:38.487 --> 41:40.279
Want me to lie?

41:40.447 --> 41:42.990
No, I'll take it.

41:44.493 --> 41:46.077
Thank you.

41:48.497 --> 41:49.580
Dormer here.

41:49.748 --> 41:55.253
I was shocked to hear about your
partner. I was getting to know him...

41:55.462 --> 41:56.671
What do you want?

41:56.839 --> 42:00.675
You know what I want,
Eckhart was gonna give it to me.

42:00.884 --> 42:03.428
You got something to say, just say it.

42:03.637 --> 42:06.806
- He told you about our conversation?
- Say it.

42:06.974 --> 42:11.853
Let's just say I'm interested to see
your report on what happened.

42:12.312 --> 42:14.856
Don't presume to know what happened.

42:15.023 --> 42:18.693
You weren't here.
But then, you never are, are you?

42:19.027 --> 42:23.656
You're always safe behind some desk,
reading your bullshit reports.

42:23.866 --> 42:28.202
And that is why I have
nothing but contempt for you.

42:28.370 --> 42:31.831
You and all the assholes like you...

42:32.332 --> 42:37.211
...risk nothing, spend all day sucking
the marrow out of real cops...

42:37.421 --> 42:41.382
...when you never had
the balls to be one yourself.

45:04.568 --> 45:08.487
Detective, you came yourself.
- Yeah.

45:09.656 --> 45:11.324
Sign here.

45:20.250 --> 45:22.043
He didn't suffer too much.

45:23.837 --> 45:25.922
- What's the caliber?
- Don't know.

45:26.089 --> 45:30.426
The gunshot victims I see are
from rifles. Wasn't one of those.

45:32.554 --> 45:35.723
- Had any sleep, detective?
- Yeah.

46:01.750 --> 46:04.752
- What the hell is wrong with you?
- Sorry.

46:09.508 --> 46:10.508
No problem.

46:10.884 --> 46:14.887
- Bullet. I want results by tomorrow.
Aye, aye, cap'n.

46:15.138 --> 46:17.890
We should check Randy's
whereabouts.

46:18.058 --> 46:19.850
Think it was Randy out there?

46:20.018 --> 46:23.980
He still doesn't have an alibi.
You said he beat Kay.

46:24.564 --> 46:26.857
- You check it out, then.
- I will.

46:54.302 --> 46:56.053
Detective Dormer?

46:58.223 --> 46:59.807
My report. I finished.

47:00.017 --> 47:03.394
I need you to look it over
and sign it.

47:03.562 --> 47:09.025
It's self-explanatory. I look forward
to getting back to work with you.

47:09.192 --> 47:12.987
We have more important
things to do than paperwork.

47:22.122 --> 47:24.957
A man died, Ellie. This is important.

47:25.167 --> 47:28.627
Of course. I didn't mean
to imply that that wasn't...

47:28.795 --> 47:31.839
Be sure of your facts
before you file this.

47:32.883 --> 47:35.718
It's your name on the report.

48:48.667 --> 48:51.210
He couldn't have come from there.

49:03.723 --> 49:05.891
Dormer here.

49:07.894 --> 49:11.730
- Hello?
Can't sleep, Will?

49:11.898 --> 49:13.899
Me neither.

49:14.151 --> 49:15.234
Who's this?

49:15.443 --> 49:20.030
I got a nap this afternoon,
but I guess you had to work.

49:20.198 --> 49:21.657
Who am I speaking to?

49:21.825 --> 49:24.577
Get rid of your clock yet?
Won't help.

49:24.744 --> 49:28.664
When I moved here, I went
five nights. You believe that?

49:28.874 --> 49:32.251
- This crazy light.
A name or I'm gonna hang up.

49:32.419 --> 49:37.214
No, you're not. You need the company.
Nothing as lonely as not sleeping.

49:37.424 --> 49:42.261
Feels like the whole fucking planet
is deserted. Just you and me.

49:42.470 --> 49:44.263
So...

49:44.764 --> 49:48.642
...tell me who I'm talking to,
and we can chat a while.

49:48.852 --> 49:50.644
- I can't do that.
- Why not?

49:50.812 --> 49:54.106
- Not till you understand some things.
- Like what?

49:54.274 --> 49:55.941
I saw.

49:58.111 --> 50:02.448
- Saw what?
- Saw you shoot your partner.

50:03.074 --> 50:07.369
Saw him die in your arms
on that beach.

50:07.537 --> 50:11.290
I thought you'd blame me.
That's why I dropped my gun.

50:11.458 --> 50:14.210
- My uncle's old. 38.
- Yeah.

50:14.419 --> 50:18.255
- You get it? What about ballistics?
- Listen to me now.

50:18.423 --> 50:21.926
I don't know what you think you saw.

50:22.093 --> 50:25.638
We should discuss this,
don't you think? Face to face.

50:25.805 --> 50:29.391
This situation isn't yours
to control. I saw you.

50:29.559 --> 50:32.895
I'll control this situation, pal.

50:33.063 --> 50:37.983
Because you don't hide from me
in a town this small. Get it?

50:38.151 --> 50:39.902
No, not for long.

50:40.070 --> 50:43.864
I need your help.
I'm not telling anyone anything.

50:44.032 --> 50:46.533
We're partners on this.

51:20.777 --> 51:24.613
- but to be remembered
as the Kay we knew and loved.

51:24.823 --> 51:28.325
Swimming,
hiking through the Kebaughs...

51:28.535 --> 51:31.287
...meeting at Darrow's after school...

51:31.454 --> 51:36.875
...and always,
always with a smile on her face.

51:38.295 --> 51:40.004
Detective Dormer?

51:41.131 --> 51:45.759
I want to check something. I was
going over my report last night...

51:45.927 --> 51:50.180
...and I have a question about
where that second shot came from.

51:50.390 --> 51:53.475
You said you heard it
from the waterline...

51:53.685 --> 51:57.104
...but from the way
Detective Eckhart's body fell...

51:57.272 --> 52:02.067
...it couldn't have come from
the rocks further up from the water.

52:02.402 --> 52:08.198
Do you think it's possible you heard
the shot before you hit the waterline?

52:09.200 --> 52:12.286
- Detective Dormer?
- Yeah, it's possible.

52:13.079 --> 52:14.621
Yeah.

52:20.837 --> 52:22.755
Why don't I give her a ride?

52:22.922 --> 52:26.800
Thought I smelled something.
- How you doing? Coping?

52:26.968 --> 52:28.635
- You're that cop.
- Yeah.

52:29.304 --> 52:32.723
- Are you coming or not?
- Not.

52:42.734 --> 52:47.112
You want a stick of gum?
I love chewing gum.

52:47.822 --> 52:50.366
It keeps me awake.

52:51.826 --> 52:55.704
- I never met anyone from L.A. before.
- Not missing much.

52:55.872 --> 52:59.500
- So how do you like our shithole town?
- It's not bad.

53:01.294 --> 53:05.589
- Were you good friends with Kay?
- Best friends. Since grade school.

53:05.757 --> 53:09.009
- That's a long time.
- Yeah, we were like sisters.

53:09.177 --> 53:13.222
Like sisters? Must be tough
for you what happened, then.

53:13.390 --> 53:17.393
Everyone keeps telling me
I'm doing great, considering.

53:17.560 --> 53:20.312
But they're all real worried about me.

53:20.480 --> 53:23.982
They don't even care
if I show up for school or not.

53:24.150 --> 53:26.485
Worried I haven't cried yet.

53:27.237 --> 53:30.197
But ain't no law says
you gotta cry, right?

53:30.365 --> 53:32.116
No, there ain't.

53:37.372 --> 53:39.623
What about her other friends?

53:41.000 --> 53:45.421
Do we have to talk about
Kay right now? God.

53:45.588 --> 53:48.841
I don't want to think
about all that. Just drive.

53:49.008 --> 53:50.926
I understand.

53:53.221 --> 53:56.682
- Want me to take you somewhere?
- As long as it's fun.

53:57.016 --> 53:59.685
Young, impressionable girl...

53:59.853 --> 54:04.690
...left alone with older Los Angeles
cop. Who knows where we might go?

54:04.983 --> 54:07.317
Well, I know a place.

54:08.653 --> 54:12.281
Hmm. Let's just drift a while.

54:13.199 --> 54:16.452
Look at this.
Who does he think he is?

54:17.829 --> 54:20.080
What does he think he's doing?

54:20.623 --> 54:22.708
- Move over.
- Let him move over.

54:22.876 --> 54:24.209
Come on! Move over!

54:25.044 --> 54:28.005
What are you doing?
Move over, you crazy fuck!

54:29.007 --> 54:30.382
- Oh, my...
- I moved over.

54:34.179 --> 54:37.014
Just a little visit to the dump!

54:37.182 --> 54:42.102
- You should feel at home.
- You just about killed us! Get off me!

54:42.812 --> 54:45.814
- What is this?
- You and Kay were like sisters?

54:45.982 --> 54:50.319
- Yes. I told you.
- Why are her pictures of you torn?

54:50.528 --> 54:55.115
Why was her boyfriend's hands
all over your ass at her funeral?

54:55.283 --> 54:58.827
Randy doesn't have an alibi
because he was with you.

54:59.287 --> 55:02.915
You were out fucking
your best friend's boyfriend.

55:03.082 --> 55:07.377
- That what best friends do?
- She never really loved Randy, okay?

55:07.629 --> 55:09.338
- She didn't love him?
- No.

55:09.506 --> 55:13.008
How do you figure that?
She have someone else?

55:13.176 --> 55:16.845
- I don't know.
- Someone bought her dresses, jewelry?

55:17.180 --> 55:18.764
Hey, look around.

55:18.932 --> 55:23.393
I want to show you something.
You'll understand why I brought you.

55:23.561 --> 55:28.482
This is the spot where your
best friend's naked body was dumped.

55:29.150 --> 55:31.902
Wrapped up in garbage bags!

55:35.156 --> 55:36.573
Tanya...

55:37.242 --> 55:42.329
...I know you don't want anyone knowing
you betrayed your best friend.

55:42.497 --> 55:46.959
That's why you won't give Randy
an alibi for Friday night. I know.

55:47.126 --> 55:51.338
Tell me who Kay was seeing.
And we can forget the whole thing.

55:51.506 --> 55:55.634
It'd be our secret. Our little secret,
but I need a name.

55:55.802 --> 55:57.928
She wouldn't tell me, okay?

55:58.137 --> 56:01.431
She wouldn't tell you?
You're her best friend.

56:01.599 --> 56:04.643
- It was her big fucking secret!
- Why a secret?

56:04.811 --> 56:08.814
I don't... Because she thought
she was special...

56:09.482 --> 56:12.985
...and she kept saying he'd
help her get out of here.

56:13.152 --> 56:14.987
- Who is "he"?
- I don't know.

56:15.154 --> 56:16.905
- She talked about him?
- Yeah.

56:17.115 --> 56:18.782
- She talked to you?
- Yeah.

56:18.992 --> 56:21.410
And what did she call him?

56:21.619 --> 56:23.954
- She called him something, right?
- Yes!

56:24.122 --> 56:27.499
What? What'd she call him?

56:28.960 --> 56:30.502
Brody.

56:31.254 --> 56:36.008
She called him Brody. That's not
his name, so what's the difference?

56:36.175 --> 56:41.179
Jesus! You happy now,
you fucking asshole?

56:47.270 --> 56:50.731
Okay. You did good. Come on.
I'll let you drive.

56:50.898 --> 56:52.107
You wanna drive?

57:01.075 --> 57:04.328
It's just poetry.
I read it line by line.

57:04.495 --> 57:08.582
It's nothing specific. Verses
on nature, love. That sort of stuff.

57:10.877 --> 57:12.711
Detective Dormer. Line one.

57:13.296 --> 57:16.006
- Dormer here.
How're you holding up?

57:16.215 --> 57:20.427
Can't be easy to keep working
after three days of no sleep.

57:20.637 --> 57:22.471
And hard to keep focus.

57:22.639 --> 57:24.640
Are you seeing things yet?

57:24.807 --> 57:28.727
You know, those little flashes?
Tricks of light?

57:28.936 --> 57:30.145
See your partner?

57:31.481 --> 57:36.068
- I see Kay sometimes.
- What can I do for you, sir?

57:36.235 --> 57:39.196
Why couldn't you tell
anyone you shot him?

57:39.697 --> 57:43.492
I mean, it was an accident, right?

57:43.660 --> 57:47.079
I hope so. For your sake.
You know what I'm saying?

57:47.246 --> 57:49.247
No need for threats.

57:49.415 --> 57:52.709
I'm trying to make you
understand my situation.

57:52.877 --> 57:57.255
You thought no one would believe
you because of the trouble in L.A.

57:57.423 --> 58:01.510
- I know what that's like, Will.
Uh-huh.

58:01.928 --> 58:04.137
- I got the same problem.
- You do?

58:04.305 --> 58:07.683
Mm-hm. I'm not who you think I am.

58:07.850 --> 58:10.102
You're not?
- No.

58:10.269 --> 58:15.899
- I'm not a murderer any more than you.
- Why don't we get together?

58:16.067 --> 58:17.984
Talk, have a beer, whatever?

58:18.152 --> 58:20.946
- Throw a little gas on the fire?
- Yeah...

58:33.876 --> 58:37.129
I gotta go check some things.
Why don't you...

58:37.296 --> 58:40.382
...put this stuff back
into evidence and tell...

58:40.842 --> 58:42.217
- What's that guy?
Fred.

58:42.427 --> 58:45.053
Tell him I'll see him in the morning.

58:45.221 --> 58:48.140
Can we return this?
Her mother might like it.

58:48.307 --> 58:49.349
Sure.

01:00:12.892 --> 01:00:14.559
That's right.

01:04:21.140 --> 01:04:22.182
Here.

01:04:47.833 --> 01:04:51.169
This is Walter.
Leave a message, wait for the beep.

01:04:51.337 --> 01:04:54.881
Will, you there?
Where else can you go in that state?

01:04:55.049 --> 01:04:57.217
You must've been freezing.

01:04:57.384 --> 01:05:00.011
If you want, take a shower.
There are clean towels in the bathroom.

01:05:08.312 --> 01:05:11.606
This is Walter.
Leave a message, wait for the beep.

01:05:11.816 --> 01:05:16.069
Will, pick up.
I'm not dumb enough to come back...

01:05:16.237 --> 01:05:19.030
- Walter Finch.
- Will.

01:05:19.198 --> 01:05:21.324
Will Dormer, what are you doing?

01:05:21.492 --> 01:05:25.161
I try to help and you're running
around like a maniac.

01:05:25.329 --> 01:05:28.790
Were you gonna kill me?
How would you explain that?

01:05:28.958 --> 01:05:34.254
No one gets too upset when child
murderers are brought in feet first.

01:05:34.421 --> 01:05:38.800
There's no evidence I killed Kay.
You know because I told you.

01:05:39.009 --> 01:05:43.096
- Come on. What's wrong with you?
- Guess I'm a little cranky.

01:05:43.264 --> 01:05:45.932
- Lack of sleep.
- Get some rest, will you?

01:05:46.142 --> 01:05:49.144
Got some pills,
and my bed's nice and comfy.

01:05:49.645 --> 01:05:54.190
Another night up and you'll lose it.
Hallucinating, babbling.

01:05:54.400 --> 01:05:59.571
Tomorrow when you feel better,
we'll meet in public. We'll sort it out.

01:05:59.738 --> 01:06:03.867
There's a ferry north of Nightmute.
I'll be on the 11:00.

01:06:04.076 --> 01:06:08.997
And before you leave, could you
feed the dogs? They're on a diet.

01:06:45.701 --> 01:06:47.577
Dormer? Fax from the lab.

01:06:47.745 --> 01:06:50.163
Weapon was a. 38 Smith & Wesson.

01:06:51.373 --> 01:06:56.127
- We found something that might...
- I found this. At the Connells'.

01:07:01.467 --> 01:07:02.800
And?

01:07:02.968 --> 01:07:06.346
It's the author of the book
we found in Kay's bag.

01:07:06.513 --> 01:07:09.265
It's signed by the author.
He's a local.

01:07:09.433 --> 01:07:12.602
Kay had all his books.
We should check it out.

01:07:13.520 --> 01:07:17.607
- Small stuff, right?
- Yeah. Sure, sure.

01:07:18.234 --> 01:07:21.361
Nice work, Ellie.
She's got sharp eyes, huh?

01:07:21.737 --> 01:07:24.614
You bet your ass she does.

01:07:25.324 --> 01:07:26.991
Good stuff.

01:08:09.451 --> 01:08:11.744
What a view.

01:08:13.414 --> 01:08:16.832
- I'm not who you think I am.
- No?

01:08:18.042 --> 01:08:19.167
Walter Finch:

01:08:19.837 --> 01:08:23.171
Lousy writer. Lonely freak.

01:08:23.340 --> 01:08:25.841
Murderer. No?

01:08:26.969 --> 01:08:30.430
When I was 7, my grandmother
took me to Portland.

01:08:30.889 --> 01:08:34.559
We were walking along
and two guys snatched her purse.

01:08:34.768 --> 01:08:37.603
A police officer came
to ask questions.

01:08:37.770 --> 01:08:41.107
He stood the whole time.
Uniform looked brand-new.

01:08:41.692 --> 01:08:46.404
Shoes, badge were polished.
It was like a soldier, only better.

01:08:46.572 --> 01:08:49.282
I respect your profession.
I write about it.

01:08:49.450 --> 01:08:54.120
I wanted to become a cop after school.
I couldn't pass all the tests.

01:08:54.287 --> 01:08:58.166
You should've tried Internal Affairs.
They'd have taken you.

01:08:58.334 --> 01:09:00.292
What do you want from me?

01:09:00.461 --> 01:09:04.505
After Kay died, I knew everyone
would think I meant to do it.

01:09:04.673 --> 01:09:09.093
So I cleaned the body, removed
all evidence connecting it to me.

01:09:09.720 --> 01:09:12.971
Except for your fucking novel. Heh.

01:09:13.182 --> 01:09:16.017
Under pressure. You don't always see
the wood for the trees.

01:09:16.185 --> 01:09:19.645
You, for one, should have
figured that out by now.

01:09:29.031 --> 01:09:33.283
When I heard they had brought
somebody from L.A., I panicked.

01:09:33.452 --> 01:09:37.121
I knew the locals would
connect me to Kay eventually.

01:09:37.288 --> 01:09:41.959
I could handle them. They never
look in the eyes of a killer.

01:09:42.669 --> 01:09:45.546
Killing changes you. You know that.

01:09:45.714 --> 01:09:47.548
It's not guilt.

01:09:47.758 --> 01:09:50.301
I never meant to do it.

01:09:50.969 --> 01:09:53.805
It's like awareness.

01:09:53.971 --> 01:09:57.809
Life is so important.
How could it be so fucking fragile?

01:09:57.976 --> 01:10:00.520
You'd see it right away,
wouldn't you?

01:10:00.687 --> 01:10:04.774
You trying to impress me?
Because you got the wrong guy.

01:10:04.942 --> 01:10:07.819
Killing that girl
made you feel special.

01:10:08.153 --> 01:10:10.655
But you're not.

01:10:11.782 --> 01:10:17.328
You're the same pathetic freak
I've been dealing with for 30 years.

01:10:17.496 --> 01:10:20.706
Know how many of you
I caught with your pants down?

01:10:20.874 --> 01:10:22.083
I never touched her like that.

01:10:22.251 --> 01:10:27.755
You wanted to. Now you wish you had.

01:10:27.923 --> 01:10:30.925
Best you could do is clip her nails.

01:10:32.511 --> 01:10:36.264
Now you're so different.
You don't get it, do you?

01:10:36.432 --> 01:10:39.225
You're my job.
You're what I'm paid to do.

01:10:39.601 --> 01:10:43.980
You're about as mysterious to me
as a toilet is to a plumber.

01:10:44.523 --> 01:10:49.277
Reasons for doing what you did?
Who gives a fuck?

01:10:49.486 --> 01:10:51.988
Motivations are everything, Will.

01:10:52.865 --> 01:10:55.741
What did you see through the fog?

01:10:56.618 --> 01:11:00.455
I saw pretty clearly, didn't I?
I saw you take aim...

01:11:00.622 --> 01:11:03.082
- Forget it.
... shoot your partner in the chest.

01:11:03.250 --> 01:11:04.917
Oh, well.

01:11:05.127 --> 01:11:08.504
I heard him say,
"Get away from me!" Why?

01:11:08.839 --> 01:11:12.175
Anything to do with
Internal Affairs investigation?

01:11:12.342 --> 01:11:15.052
All that tension in your department?

01:11:15.387 --> 01:11:19.390
- You think I'm that easy?
- I'm saying that's how it looks.

01:11:19.892 --> 01:11:22.393
Maybe even how it feels.

01:11:24.021 --> 01:11:30.401
How did it feel when you found
out it was Hap? Guilt? Relie¤

01:11:31.361 --> 01:11:36.532
Suddenly, you're free and clear. Did
you think about it before that moment?

01:11:36.950 --> 01:11:40.578
What would it be like
if he wasn't there anymore?

01:11:43.165 --> 01:11:46.083
Doesn't mean you did it on purpose.

01:11:54.343 --> 01:11:58.804
You figure if you got something on me,
then I'll just roll over?

01:11:58.972 --> 01:12:02.183
- Protect my reputation?
- No.

01:12:02.518 --> 01:12:04.352
Protect your life's work.

01:12:04.978 --> 01:12:10.399
The scumbags you put away will be back
on the street before you go on trial.

01:12:10.984 --> 01:12:14.946
With Hap gone, you're free and clear.
Why mess with that?

01:12:17.866 --> 01:12:21.160
Kay Connell. Remember her?

01:12:22.496 --> 01:12:24.497
It's your choice.

01:12:26.041 --> 01:12:28.543
Think of all the other Kay Connells.

01:12:28.710 --> 01:12:33.256
Do the math. You're a pragmatist.
You have to be because of your job.

01:12:34.007 --> 01:12:37.218
This isn't easy,
but I want you to understand...

01:12:37.386 --> 01:12:40.012
...we're in the same situation here.

01:12:40.514 --> 01:12:44.934
You didn't mean to kill Hap
any more than I meant to kill Kay.

01:12:45.394 --> 01:12:50.231
But that's hard for them to believe,
so that's why we need each other.

01:12:51.358 --> 01:12:55.444
We gotta find a patsy for the
Connell case and make it stick.

01:12:55.696 --> 01:13:00.908
Do that. Then you go back to Los Angeles
and I can go back to living my life.

01:13:03.662 --> 01:13:07.540
So, what do you need from me?

01:13:09.167 --> 01:13:11.544
What do they know about me?

01:13:13.505 --> 01:13:18.843
Uh... They found a signed copy of one
of your books at Kay's house.

01:13:19.011 --> 01:13:23.389
- So you'll be brought in for questioning.
- At the station?

01:13:23.557 --> 01:13:26.100
That's what they usually do.

01:13:26.268 --> 01:13:30.021
Brought in for questioning.
I can write that easily.

01:13:30.188 --> 01:13:35.443
Calm down. It's no big thing.
It's preliminary inquiry, so...

01:13:35.611 --> 01:13:38.821
...just tell the truth.

01:13:38.989 --> 01:13:42.950
- Tell them about Randy...
- Why are you talking about Randy?

01:13:43.118 --> 01:13:48.289
Talk about your relationship with Kay.
You can't hide it, so just say it.

01:13:48.457 --> 01:13:52.710
Randy is none of your business.
It's not your affair.

01:13:52.878 --> 01:13:55.630
Shouldn't I tell them
she was unhappy...

01:13:55.797 --> 01:14:00.217
Tell them she was unhappy,
but let them find Randy themselves.

01:14:00.385 --> 01:14:03.262
That way, they'll make it stick.

01:14:03.472 --> 01:14:05.264
Understand?

01:14:06.308 --> 01:14:08.392
We need a wild card.

01:14:09.978 --> 01:14:14.357
- A wild card?
- Yeah. Something that's there.

01:14:14.524 --> 01:14:18.486
Something we can use.
It's in every good detective novel.

01:14:18.654 --> 01:14:20.863
You still have the. 38?

01:14:22.115 --> 01:14:23.574
No.

01:14:24.660 --> 01:14:27.495
Really? That's a shame.

01:14:27.954 --> 01:14:30.915
We could use that.
That'd be very convincing for them.

01:14:34.920 --> 01:14:36.295
This is my stop.

01:14:45.806 --> 01:14:47.139
Dormer!

01:14:53.063 --> 01:14:55.147
Wild card!

01:14:59.778 --> 01:15:02.405
Night, everyone.
- Night, Francis.

01:15:03.490 --> 01:15:05.574
Working some overtime?

01:15:05.742 --> 01:15:08.911
- Nice.
- Cracking some big cases?

01:15:09.371 --> 01:15:11.706
Night.
- Night, guys.

01:15:58.044 --> 01:16:01.046
This is always the worst
time of night for me.

01:16:01.214 --> 01:16:04.633
Too late for yesterday,
too early for tomorrow.

01:16:04.801 --> 01:16:08.804
Sorry about the tape.
I had to make sure you'd follow through.

01:16:08.972 --> 01:16:10.306
I'll follow through.

01:16:10.474 --> 01:16:14.351
I've been thinking it over.
I should tell them about Randy.

01:16:15.145 --> 01:16:19.607
- I think that's a bad idea.
- But he's the patsy. He deserves it.

01:16:19.775 --> 01:16:22.818
You should have heard
the shit Kay told me. How he abused her.

01:16:22.986 --> 01:16:25.863
But these are cops.
They're not children.

01:16:26.031 --> 01:16:29.033
You don't throw things
like that in their lap.

01:16:29.201 --> 01:16:31.243
I'll push them toward Randy.

01:16:31.411 --> 01:16:33.370
When the time is right.

01:16:33.538 --> 01:16:37.917
We don't have the gun.
How will we convince them he's guilty?

01:16:38.084 --> 01:16:40.211
Did you keep the dress?

01:16:40.796 --> 01:16:41.796
The dress?

01:16:41.963 --> 01:16:45.591
Kay's dress, nail clippings.
What did you do with those?

01:16:45.759 --> 01:16:50.346
That's great. The dress. We could
use that. Even better than the gun.

01:16:50.514 --> 01:16:54.099
- Where could he have taken her?
- Where'd you take her?

01:16:54.392 --> 01:16:57.394
- She died in the cabin, right?
- Yeah.

01:16:57.562 --> 01:17:00.231
Where'd you take her
to clean her up?

01:17:00.816 --> 01:17:04.318
Don't think about that.
This is tough enough for you.

01:17:04.486 --> 01:17:06.362
- It was an accident.
- Yeah.

01:17:06.530 --> 01:17:11.575
- I didn't mean to kill her, you know.
- I know, but what happened?

01:17:12.744 --> 01:17:17.122
She called and said that
she and Randy had had a fight.

01:17:18.083 --> 01:17:22.628
She wanted to come over and talk,
and I said, "Meet me at our place. "

01:17:22.796 --> 01:17:24.880
That's the cabin at the beach.

01:17:25.048 --> 01:17:29.009
She comes over.
She's distraught and a little drunk.

01:17:30.554 --> 01:17:34.849
She starts telling me about how Randy
and Tanya were carrying on.

01:17:36.393 --> 01:17:40.145
I only wanted to comfort her.
Hold her.

01:17:44.276 --> 01:17:47.653
I kissed her,
and got a little excited...

01:17:49.239 --> 01:17:52.032
...and she started laughing at me.

01:17:53.076 --> 01:17:55.703
She wouldn't stop laughing.

01:17:56.246 --> 01:18:00.916
Ever had someone laugh at you
when you're like that? Vulnerable.

01:18:01.084 --> 01:18:04.920
Laughing their ass off?
Someone you thought respected you?

01:18:05.422 --> 01:18:07.715
You ever have that happen?

01:18:08.425 --> 01:18:12.720
I just wanted to stop her laughing.
And then, you know...

01:18:13.555 --> 01:18:14.555
...I hit her.

01:18:15.599 --> 01:18:19.268
Couple of times, to stop her.
Get a little respect.

01:18:19.436 --> 01:18:23.022
Randy did it all the time.
She liked it when he did it.

01:18:23.189 --> 01:18:26.358
She never blamed him.
Never wanted to leave him.

01:18:26.526 --> 01:18:29.904
I do it, she starts screaming.
She wouldn't stop.

01:18:31.364 --> 01:18:34.408
She's screaming.
I put my hand over her mouth.

01:18:35.577 --> 01:18:38.913
Then I'm really scared.
I'm scared shitless.

01:18:39.080 --> 01:18:43.667
More scared than I've ever been.
I'm more scared than her.

01:18:43.835 --> 01:18:45.419
And then...

01:18:46.546 --> 01:18:48.964
...everything was clear.

01:18:50.091 --> 01:18:52.009
There was no turning back.

01:18:54.346 --> 01:18:57.640
And after that, I was calm.

01:18:59.517 --> 01:19:00.643
Real calm.

01:19:04.230 --> 01:19:06.607
You and I share a secret.

01:19:07.359 --> 01:19:10.527
We know how easy
it is to kill somebody.

01:19:11.613 --> 01:19:16.867
That ultimate taboo.
It doesn't exist outside our minds.

01:19:17.202 --> 01:19:19.203
I didn't murder her.

01:19:19.704 --> 01:19:23.832
I killed her,
but it just ended up that way.

01:19:24.709 --> 01:19:27.211
So where'd you take the body?

01:19:27.712 --> 01:19:29.546
Thanks for listening to me.

01:19:29.714 --> 01:19:34.385
Feels good to talk about that stuff.
I'll be able to sleep now.

01:19:35.053 --> 01:19:37.137
You wanna talk about Hap?

01:19:48.984 --> 01:19:51.527
- Morning.
- Your phone isn't working.

01:19:51.695 --> 01:19:54.446
I turned it off.
I needed to sleep. Sorry.

01:19:54.614 --> 01:19:58.450
Fred called that author.
He was happy to cooperate.

01:19:58.618 --> 01:20:02.371
He'll be in first thing,
so we need to get to the office.

01:20:02.539 --> 01:20:06.458
I forgot to tell you they sell these
in stores in Anchorage.

01:20:06.626 --> 01:20:09.878
- No way of finding out who bought it.
- Okay.

01:20:10.046 --> 01:20:13.549
Bet you're looking forward
to getting back to L.A.

01:20:13.717 --> 01:20:16.301
Back to robbery homicide, or...

01:20:16.678 --> 01:20:18.595
...maybe not.

01:20:18.763 --> 01:20:23.017
- What are you saying to me, Ellie?
- Nothing.

01:20:25.937 --> 01:20:29.314
Are you doing okay?
You haven't been sleeping much.

01:20:29.482 --> 01:20:31.942
No, I haven't. No.

01:20:36.656 --> 01:20:40.659
A good cop can't sleep because
a piece of the puzzle's missing.

01:20:40.827 --> 01:20:44.079
A bad cop, because his
conscience won't let him.

01:20:44.998 --> 01:20:47.791
- You said that once.
- I did?

01:20:51.379 --> 01:20:54.465
Sounds like something
I'd say, don't it?

01:20:56.718 --> 01:20:58.927
I'll see you back there.

01:20:59.721 --> 01:21:01.972
You were acquainted with the
deceased, Kay Connell?

01:21:02.140 --> 01:21:03.182
Yes, I was.

01:21:03.349 --> 01:21:05.642
In what regard were you
and her familiar?

01:21:05.810 --> 01:21:08.145
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:21:08.730 --> 01:21:12.483
- How did you know her?
- She was an avid reader of my novels.

01:21:12.650 --> 01:21:14.651
When did you meet her first?

01:21:14.819 --> 01:21:18.155
A year ago. She came
to a signing in Nightmute.

01:21:18.323 --> 01:21:22.201
She hung around afterwards.
We chatted about my writing...

01:21:22.368 --> 01:21:24.745
...and how she wanted to write...

01:21:25.330 --> 01:21:31.001
...then she asked if she could visit me
and talk about books, things like that.

01:21:31.169 --> 01:21:34.004
- And she did?
- Yeah, we became very close.

01:21:34.172 --> 01:21:37.508
She got comfortable enough
to show me her writing.

01:21:37.675 --> 01:21:40.219
- What does she write?
- Poetry, actually.

01:21:40.386 --> 01:21:42.805
- Any good?
- No, not really.

01:21:43.181 --> 01:21:46.850
- You tell her that?
- Why would I?

01:21:48.353 --> 01:21:53.398
Exactly what was the nature of your
relationship to this girl, Finch?

01:21:53.566 --> 01:21:58.237
I was someone she could talk to.
Someone outside of her everyday life.

01:21:58.655 --> 01:22:01.698
That's why she needed me
and approached me.

01:22:01.866 --> 01:22:04.076
Why'd she need you for that?

01:22:04.536 --> 01:22:09.039
- Well, her boyfriend, Randy...
- Randy Stetz?

01:22:09.874 --> 01:22:14.378
- Abusive little prick. He hit her.
- We know all this already.

01:22:14.546 --> 01:22:16.839
- It was getting worse.
- So?

01:22:17.006 --> 01:22:18.549
A lot worse. Really.

01:22:18.716 --> 01:22:22.052
Why all this eagerness
to talk about Randy?

01:22:22.679 --> 01:22:26.140
You're right. I'm sorry.
That's probably all hearsay.

01:22:26.307 --> 01:22:29.476
I don't want anything I say
taken the wrong way.

01:22:29.644 --> 01:22:33.355
Anything you say to us
at this stage is in confidence.

01:22:33.523 --> 01:22:38.152
Secondly, we're not a bunch of hotheads
who'll draw crazy conclusions.

01:22:38.319 --> 01:22:40.904
- Okay.
Please, continue.

01:22:41.531 --> 01:22:46.743
One more thing. Probably doesn't
mean much, but I think Kay was scared.

01:22:46.953 --> 01:22:50.372
- I have myself to blame for that.
- Why is that?

01:22:51.082 --> 01:22:54.960
Randy knew who I was.
He knew that she had a friend...

01:22:55.128 --> 01:22:58.088
...someone she confided in.
It made him furious.

01:22:58.423 --> 01:23:03.010
She wrote about being scared.
Her letters were getting desperate.

01:23:03.178 --> 01:23:06.180
You still have these letters,
by any chance?

01:23:06.347 --> 01:23:09.850
I probably do.
Do you think it might help?

01:23:10.185 --> 01:23:11.685
They might.

01:23:13.855 --> 01:23:17.149
Okay. Anything else?

01:23:17.317 --> 01:23:21.695
The thing that worried her
the most was the gun.

01:23:21.863 --> 01:23:25.199
He had this old handgun.
He showed it to her.

01:23:25.366 --> 01:23:29.119
I don't know where he got it,
probably wasn't even his...

01:23:29.287 --> 01:23:33.540
...but he said he'd use it if he
found out who she was seeing.

01:23:33.708 --> 01:23:38.629
He kept it hidden in a heating vent.
You know, in the skirting boards?

01:23:42.550 --> 01:23:44.676
It might be the. 38.

01:23:45.345 --> 01:23:47.095
- Get me Judge Biggs.
- What?

01:23:47.263 --> 01:23:50.057
I'm getting a search
warrant to Randy's.

01:23:50.225 --> 01:23:54.519
- Get Judge Biggs on the phone.
- I should get over there.

01:23:54.812 --> 01:23:56.104
- No!
- No?

01:23:56.272 --> 01:24:02.027
You're the guy he's talking to.
So we're waiting for the warrant. Okay?

01:24:05.281 --> 01:24:08.575
Do you know when Randy
showed her the gun?

01:24:08.785 --> 01:24:10.786
February?

01:24:11.913 --> 01:24:13.997
No, probably January.

01:24:14.165 --> 01:24:16.959
Why didn't you come
forward when she died?

01:24:17.126 --> 01:24:22.297
- She didn't want anybody to know.
- Even when she was dead?

01:24:22.548 --> 01:24:26.843
Beaten to death. Her body
dumped on a pile of garbage!

01:24:27.011 --> 01:24:28.762
- I was her friend.
- You weren't her friend.

01:24:28.930 --> 01:24:31.807
- Acquaintance. We were close...
- Close?

01:24:31.975 --> 01:24:35.602
She was attractive.
Did you have sex with her?

01:24:35.812 --> 01:24:38.689
- She was 17.
- Seventeen? She was attractive.

01:24:38.856 --> 01:24:39.982
I suppose.

01:24:40.149 --> 01:24:43.443
Suppose? She was.
So did you have sex with her?

01:24:43.611 --> 01:24:47.614
- No, I was her mentor.
- You bought her things. Gifts.

01:24:47.991 --> 01:24:49.992
- Yes.
- What kind of gifts?

01:24:50.159 --> 01:24:54.997
- Books, mostly, that's what she loved.
- Books? What about this?

01:24:55.248 --> 01:24:58.375
- You give her this?
- Yes.

01:24:59.043 --> 01:25:00.544
Why?

01:25:00.795 --> 01:25:03.714
- To see how she looked with it on?
- No.

01:25:03.881 --> 01:25:06.717
- No? Why jewelry?
- It was just a present.

01:25:06.884 --> 01:25:10.804
- Bought a lot of presents? Dresses?
- What's wrong with that?

01:25:10.972 --> 01:25:14.808
Nothing. I'm figuring out
what kind of mentor you were.

01:25:14.976 --> 01:25:17.394
I gave her things she couldn't have.

01:25:17.562 --> 01:25:21.356
You wanted to fuck her, didn't you?
Sick son of a bitch!

01:25:23.359 --> 01:25:25.319
Cool off.
- Sick bastard.

01:25:25.903 --> 01:25:28.739
You have to cool down. Okay?
Cool down.

01:25:28.906 --> 01:25:32.576
All right. I need a break.

01:25:49.469 --> 01:25:52.179
I have to apologize
on behalf of my colleague.

01:25:52.347 --> 01:25:57.267
Ahem. He's been under a lot of pressure
lately. But he's a good cop.

01:25:57.852 --> 01:26:00.979
I'd hate to see the bad cop.

01:26:06.152 --> 01:26:08.779
Search and seizure warrant.
Yes, sir.

01:26:08.946 --> 01:26:11.323
Randy Stetz. We'll fill in the rest later.

01:26:23.669 --> 01:26:26.880
- We got our warrant!
- Thank you. We appreciate it.

01:26:39.435 --> 01:26:41.978
Francis, come with me. Let's go!

01:26:47.193 --> 01:26:49.152
You're not going?
No.

01:27:13.428 --> 01:27:15.679
Are you not on the Connell case?

01:27:15.930 --> 01:27:19.766
I'm covering the shooting
of Detective Dormer's partner.

01:27:19.934 --> 01:27:21.309
Heard about that. It's tragic.

01:27:24.147 --> 01:27:26.022
Should I call about Kay's letters?

01:27:26.190 --> 01:27:28.775
- Yeah. I'll pick them up.
- Okay.

01:27:52.341 --> 01:27:55.093
Stetz! We're coming in!

01:28:12.069 --> 01:28:14.196
Turn the place over.

01:28:24.624 --> 01:28:26.583
Look there! Try over there!

01:28:27.043 --> 01:28:29.211
Rich, look here now.

01:28:36.093 --> 01:28:37.886
I got it! Hey, Fred!

01:28:58.157 --> 01:29:01.618
- Just in time, Dormer.
Had it in the motor oil.

01:29:04.622 --> 01:29:06.039
What the fuck is this?

01:29:29.438 --> 01:29:32.482
He says he was with Tanya
when Kay was killed.

01:29:32.650 --> 01:29:34.985
- That's what she told me.
- When?

01:29:35.152 --> 01:29:38.738
- When I questioned her.
- Were you planning on telling us?

01:29:38.906 --> 01:29:40.740
That's what I'm doing now.

01:29:46.664 --> 01:29:51.001
Randy and Tanya were screwing around.
She's trying to protect him.

01:29:51.168 --> 01:29:53.420
And the gun?
Says it isn't his.

01:29:53.588 --> 01:29:57.173
If we get the ballistics match,
he'll be forthcoming.

01:29:57.341 --> 01:29:59.426
- So you leaving us?
First thing tomorrow.

01:29:59.594 --> 01:30:02.929
If Spencer can remember
where he parked the plane.

01:30:29.206 --> 01:30:31.791
I thought you wanted to kill me
in the interview room.

01:30:31.959 --> 01:30:36.963
- I did. Randy is in jail.
- Said I'd write an ending they'd like.

01:30:37.173 --> 01:30:39.215
You were wrapped up in details.

01:30:39.383 --> 01:30:42.344
- The details? He's innocent.
- No, he isn't.

01:30:42.511 --> 01:30:45.472
He beat Kay.
One day he'd do something worse.

01:30:53.648 --> 01:30:55.482
You knew I planted the gun?

01:30:55.650 --> 01:30:58.735
You wanted to help me
before the tape recorder.

01:30:58.903 --> 01:31:01.154
You had to have a wild card.

01:31:01.322 --> 01:31:05.325
You're a good man. I know that,
even if you've forgotten it.

01:31:05.785 --> 01:31:11.164
When were you gonna point them
at me? When you found Kay's dress?

01:31:11.749 --> 01:31:15.502
Where I took the body?
If you have a gun and forensics...

01:31:15.670 --> 01:31:20.131
...wouldn't matter what I said
about you killing your partner.

01:31:33.312 --> 01:31:35.563
May I have the tape?

01:31:43.280 --> 01:31:46.658
- Did you make any other copies?
- Why would I?

01:31:46.951 --> 01:31:49.160
Stop me from turning you in.

01:31:49.787 --> 01:31:50.995
Or killing you.

01:31:51.163 --> 01:31:54.374
I don't have a hold over you.
You made your own choices.

01:31:54.542 --> 01:31:58.002
Like I wasn't here. Why kill me?
It won't help Randy.

01:31:58.170 --> 01:32:02.716
After your scene at the department,
it won't do you good if I'm dead.

01:32:02.883 --> 01:32:07.512
- A lot of ways a man can die.
- Like an accident? Like Hap.

01:32:08.681 --> 01:32:10.056
Like Kay.

01:32:12.101 --> 01:32:15.979
It took you 10 minutes to beat
Kay Connell to death.

01:32:16.272 --> 01:32:20.442
Ten fucking minutes.
You calling that an accident?

01:32:20.609 --> 01:32:24.404
It took you a fraction of a second
to kill your partner.

01:32:24.572 --> 01:32:26.823
Is that more of an accident?

01:32:28.993 --> 01:32:31.035
Is this an accident?

01:32:34.874 --> 01:32:37.167
If you want it to be.

01:32:51.474 --> 01:32:53.683
It's over, Walt.

01:32:54.268 --> 01:32:59.355
It's over. I'm telling them everything.
Tell them about Hap, you, everything.

01:32:59.523 --> 01:33:02.525
- What good would that do?
- It'll end this thing.

01:33:02.902 --> 01:33:06.321
It won't end it.
You're not thinking straight.

01:33:06.489 --> 01:33:11.034
Will you tell the truth? You shot
your partner and lied about it.

01:33:11.327 --> 01:33:15.955
To them, you're a liar and a killer.
You're tainted. Forever!

01:33:16.123 --> 01:33:21.628
You don't get to pick when you tell
the truth. The truth is beyond that.

01:33:22.713 --> 01:33:27.884
That tape was the only proof we had
a conversation outside of that room.

01:33:29.053 --> 01:33:31.679
To them, I'm a writer
that Kay admired.

01:33:31.847 --> 01:33:36.518
Randy is the killer, and you're a
hero cop. Your life's work is intact.

01:33:36.936 --> 01:33:41.648
Another abusive scumbag is in jail.
Everything is as it should be.

01:33:41.816 --> 01:33:46.569
Go back to Los Angeles.
The case against Randy is pretty solid.

01:33:46.904 --> 01:33:52.408
I can take care of everything here.
I got it worked out. Go home.

01:33:57.498 --> 01:34:01.584
Midnight of your sixth night.
You broke my record, Will.

01:34:40.374 --> 01:34:44.294
Randy Stetz. He was an asshole.
You knew him as a kid?

01:34:44.461 --> 01:34:47.964
- Dads were on the same boat.
- Bad seed.

01:34:48.299 --> 01:34:50.425
How do you like our beer?

01:34:56.140 --> 01:34:58.808
What Dormer needs
is a little shuteye.

01:34:58.976 --> 01:35:01.978
- White nights getting to you?
- Hasn't been easy.

01:35:02.146 --> 01:35:04.564
Better than winter.
Got that right.

01:35:04.732 --> 01:35:09.861
- Sun barely comes up for five months.
Like being sucked into a black hole.

01:35:10.279 --> 01:35:13.281
Hi, guys.
- Hey, Nancy Drew. You hear? We got him.

01:35:13.449 --> 01:35:15.825
- Yeah. I heard.
- Rich found the gun.

01:35:17.578 --> 01:35:21.080
- Something's on her mind.
- I found this on the beach.

01:35:21.248 --> 01:35:24.459
What is it?
Shell casing, 9mm.

01:35:25.502 --> 01:35:29.172
The murder weapon was a. 38.
None of us carries a 9mm.

01:35:29.340 --> 01:35:31.341
Or backup weapon, right?

01:35:33.010 --> 01:35:35.219
Get a hobby, would you?

01:35:35.554 --> 01:35:38.848
It's a legitimate point,
isn't it, detective?

01:35:42.353 --> 01:35:48.775
This case is closed, Ellie. Hold the
fort, boys. I'll go find a men's room.

01:35:49.234 --> 01:35:53.196
Relieve myself of your
fine Alaskan beer.

01:35:53.489 --> 01:35:55.615
Do you want a beer or something?

01:35:56.241 --> 01:35:57.867
No, thanks.

01:35:58.327 --> 01:36:02.664
He's good people, right?
Don't get carried away.

01:36:03.666 --> 01:36:06.417
What has two thumbs
and loves blowjobs?

01:36:06.585 --> 01:36:08.628
I don't know.
- This guy.

01:36:11.507 --> 01:36:12.548
Sorry.

01:36:18.889 --> 01:36:21.057
It's been something, Dormer.

01:36:21.934 --> 01:36:24.978
It's been really great
working with you.

01:36:29.066 --> 01:36:32.735
- Run Will to the airport?
I gotta pick up the letters.

01:36:32.903 --> 01:36:34.028
In Umkumiut...

01:36:34.196 --> 01:36:38.741
At his lake house. Dormer will
have to leave my car at the dock.

01:36:38.909 --> 01:36:42.537
- If that's okay with you?
- Yeah, it's fine.

01:36:48.919 --> 01:36:50.920
It's been a pleasure.

01:36:51.088 --> 01:36:52.714
Get some sleep.

01:38:16.256 --> 01:38:17.757
Detective Dormer.

01:38:19.051 --> 01:38:20.051
What is it?

01:38:20.219 --> 01:38:24.263
Someone's complaining about the noise.
Says he can't sleep.

01:38:25.015 --> 01:38:26.849
Something wrong?

01:38:27.142 --> 01:38:31.646
Well, uh...
It's so fucking bright in here.

01:38:34.108 --> 01:38:36.192
No, it's dark in here.

01:38:41.156 --> 01:38:42.740
Will you please...?

01:38:57.214 --> 01:39:02.844
There's this guy, Wayne Dobbs, 24.
Works part time at a copy store.

01:39:03.470 --> 01:39:06.848
Every day he watches
this 8-year-old boy...

01:39:07.015 --> 01:39:10.393
...waiting for his carpool
across the street.

01:39:10.561 --> 01:39:14.981
- This is one of your cases?
- Yeah. Hap and me.

01:39:15.149 --> 01:39:16.649
A year and a half ago.

01:39:16.817 --> 01:39:19.485
For six months, he watches this kid.

01:39:19.653 --> 01:39:22.113
Finally gets up the nerve.

01:39:22.281 --> 01:39:25.908
He goes down, grabs that boy
before the carpool comes...

01:39:26.076 --> 01:39:29.203
...takes him back to his apartment...

01:39:29.454 --> 01:39:33.249
...and keeps him there for three days.

01:39:34.334 --> 01:39:36.586
He tortures him...

01:39:40.007 --> 01:39:42.049
...and makes him do things.

01:39:42.217 --> 01:39:45.428
And, finally, he's had enough.
He gets a rope.

01:39:45.596 --> 01:39:50.349
He hangs the boy in a storage space
in the basement of the building.

01:39:50.601 --> 01:39:52.894
But he didn't do it right.

01:39:53.145 --> 01:39:58.816
Little boy's neck didn't break,
so he dangled there for a while...

01:39:58.984 --> 01:40:01.944
...and then died finally
from the shock.

01:40:02.154 --> 01:40:06.032
Landlord found the body
five days later.

01:40:06.533 --> 01:40:10.161
The second I met this guy, Dobbs,
I knew he was guilty.

01:40:10.370 --> 01:40:13.915
That's what I do. That's my job.
I assign guilt.

01:40:14.082 --> 01:40:16.000
You find the evidence...

01:40:16.543 --> 01:40:21.464
...figure out who did it, and then
you go get them and put them away.

01:40:22.966 --> 01:40:29.430
This time there wasn't enough evidence.
And it's reasonable doubt to a jury...

01:40:29.598 --> 01:40:34.018
...because a jury never
met a child murderer before.

01:40:34.186 --> 01:40:35.394
But I have.

01:40:37.731 --> 01:40:38.898
Anyway...

01:40:42.611 --> 01:40:47.240
I went and took some blood samples
from the boy's dead body...

01:40:49.743 --> 01:40:51.327
...and I planted them...

01:40:54.665 --> 01:40:56.707
...in Dobbs' apartment.

01:41:02.381 --> 01:41:04.006
I could feel it right there.

01:41:05.133 --> 01:41:07.677
This is gonna catch up with me.

01:41:08.303 --> 01:41:12.807
- I don't do things like that.
- So how did it catch up with you?

01:41:12.975 --> 01:41:16.435
Internal Affairs is coming down
on our department.

01:41:16.603 --> 01:41:21.107
Hap, he was gonna cut a deal...

01:41:21.900 --> 01:41:24.694
...and bring me straight into it.

01:41:24.903 --> 01:41:28.531
They would've reopened Dobbs' case,
he would've walked.

01:41:28.699 --> 01:41:32.034
Now that won't happen.
And I don't know...

01:41:32.869 --> 01:41:35.121
...how I feel about that.

01:41:36.873 --> 01:41:40.584
But Dobbs was guilty.
Dobbs needed to be convicted.

01:41:40.752 --> 01:41:45.089
So the end justifies the means.

01:41:46.842 --> 01:41:48.134
Right?

01:41:51.638 --> 01:41:55.224
- I'm in no position to judge.
- Why not?

01:41:55.684 --> 01:41:58.352
Two kinds of people live in Alaska.

01:41:58.520 --> 01:42:03.816
The ones who are born here, and the
ones who come here to escape something.

01:42:04.651 --> 01:42:06.319
I wasn't born here.

01:42:07.112 --> 01:42:09.905
Why don't you tell me what you think?

01:42:10.282 --> 01:42:14.618
Here. Now. In this room. You and me.

01:42:15.537 --> 01:42:16.746
Please.

01:42:20.792 --> 01:42:24.587
I guess it's about what you
thought was right at the time.

01:42:26.548 --> 01:42:29.425
Then, what you're willing to live with.

01:44:10.026 --> 01:44:11.694
Nightmute Police Department.

01:44:11.862 --> 01:44:13.028
Detective Burr.

01:44:13.196 --> 01:44:17.408
She's not here. She left town
about 20 minutes ago to go pick up...

01:44:42.309 --> 01:44:44.768
Mr. Finch.
Detective Burr.

01:44:44.936 --> 01:44:46.854
- Are they friendly?
- Yeah.

01:44:47.022 --> 01:44:48.689
Didn't expect to see you this soon.

01:44:48.857 --> 01:44:52.234
- Sorry about the mess, doing some work.
Oh, no problem.

01:45:05.373 --> 01:45:09.168
Could Kay's letters strengthen
the case against Randy?

01:45:09.336 --> 01:45:10.544
Possibly.

01:45:41.785 --> 01:45:44.995
Watch your head here.
I've done it 1000 times.

01:45:52.087 --> 01:45:56.090
Sorry about all the clutter.
I am a pack-rat.

01:45:57.425 --> 01:45:59.426
I keep everything.

01:46:00.303 --> 01:46:02.638
I got them. Just don't know where.

01:46:04.558 --> 01:46:08.561
- They've gotta be here somewhere.
- Working on a new book?

01:46:08.728 --> 01:46:11.522
- Have you read any of my books?
- I haven't.

01:46:52.856 --> 01:46:55.316
- She knows, Will.
- Where is she?

01:46:55.483 --> 01:47:00.362
She knows you killed Hap. You would've
realized if you weren't strung out.

01:47:00.530 --> 01:47:03.282
- The way she looks at you...
- Where is she?

01:47:03.450 --> 01:47:06.869
- Calm down. It's under control.
- If anything happened to her...

01:47:07.037 --> 01:47:08.037
She's okay.

01:47:08.204 --> 01:47:13.417
If she talks, you're fucked. Everything
you've worked for is destroyed.

01:47:15.545 --> 01:47:18.631
- Now give me...
- Show me where she is. Now.

01:47:18.798 --> 01:47:23.052
She's okay.
Listen. I mean, it's all fine.

01:47:26.181 --> 01:47:28.807
- Let's search this place. For the dress.
- What are we looking for?

01:47:28.975 --> 01:47:30.893
- What dress? Ellie's?
- Ellie's...

01:47:31.311 --> 01:47:33.145
- Kay's!
- You're rambling.

01:47:33.313 --> 01:47:34.396
Ellie's here.

01:47:34.564 --> 01:47:36.565
- I'm taking care of us.
- Us?

01:47:36.941 --> 01:47:38.567
- She saw the dress.
- Us?

01:47:38.735 --> 01:47:41.362
Where'd you get us?
Don't talk about us.

01:47:41.529 --> 01:47:43.405
She's alive, Will. Ellie!

01:48:14.270 --> 01:48:15.562
Hold it!

01:48:17.691 --> 01:48:18.816
Don't move!

01:48:19.442 --> 01:48:21.944
You shot Detective Eckhart.

01:48:24.280 --> 01:48:26.532
And Finch saw you do it.

01:48:30.286 --> 01:48:32.663
Did you mean to shoot Hap?

01:48:33.790 --> 01:48:36.125
I don't know anymore.

01:48:36.710 --> 01:48:38.001
I, uh...

01:48:38.253 --> 01:48:39.670
I don't know.

01:48:42.340 --> 01:48:47.803
I couldn't see him through the fog,
but when I got up close...

01:48:49.055 --> 01:48:51.348
...he was afraid of me...

01:48:51.850 --> 01:48:56.437
...and he thought I meant to do it,
so maybe I did.

01:48:59.941 --> 01:49:02.443
I just don't know anymore.

01:49:18.626 --> 01:49:20.502
- Where's your gun?
- He took it.

01:49:25.467 --> 01:49:27.259
Keep your head down.

01:49:28.344 --> 01:49:32.556
I got seven rounds in this clip.
Make it last. Head down.

01:49:36.561 --> 01:49:38.979
Okay, go! Go!

01:50:35.078 --> 01:50:36.995
You forgot the wild card, Will.

01:51:51.863 --> 01:51:53.989
Detective Dormer!

01:51:56.951 --> 01:52:02.456
I called for backup. They'll be
here soon. Dormer, just hold on.

01:52:03.082 --> 01:52:05.000
Hold on.

01:52:13.009 --> 01:52:15.719
Nobody needs to know.

01:52:19.641 --> 01:52:23.268
You didn't mean to do it.
I know that even if you don't.

01:52:23.436 --> 01:52:25.687
No, don't. Don't.

01:52:25.855 --> 01:52:27.689
What?

01:52:29.359 --> 01:52:30.525
Why?

01:52:32.612 --> 01:52:35.197
Don't lose your way.

01:52:40.870 --> 01:52:42.788
Hang on.

01:52:44.874 --> 01:52:46.333
Dormer.

01:52:47.627 --> 01:52:49.378
Let me sleep.

01:52:49.545 --> 01:52:51.463
No.

01:52:52.465 --> 01:52:55.384
Just let me sleep.
