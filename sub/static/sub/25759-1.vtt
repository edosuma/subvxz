00:06.630 --> 00:09.167
- Good morning, students!

00:09.167 --> 00:10.000
As you all know,

00:10.000 --> 00:12.667
today is an extremely
important day for our school.

00:12.667 --> 00:13.500
This afternoon,

00:13.500 --> 00:15.640
Kaeluss is coming by to choose
one of you lucky students

00:15.640 --> 00:17.192
to take his place.

00:17.192 --> 00:19.490
So that means we're all
gonna follow the rules.

00:19.490 --> 00:22.575
No flying in the hallways, keep
your abilities to yourself,

00:22.575 --> 00:26.325
and please, please, be
on your best behavior.

00:28.267 --> 00:30.517
Have a super day, everyone.

00:35.682 --> 00:37.855
- Don't listen to them!

00:37.855 --> 00:41.074
Kaeluss represents corrupt corporation.

00:41.074 --> 00:43.578
Don't let your powers be bought.

00:43.578 --> 00:45.687
- Nice sign you dork.

00:45.687 --> 00:47.505
- Good luck marching by yourself.

00:51.418 --> 00:53.825
Our abilities
are not for sale!

00:53.825 --> 00:56.599
Our abilities are not for sale!

00:56.599 --> 00:59.507
- We will not be controlled.

00:59.507 --> 01:02.215
Well, metaphorically speaking.

01:04.000 --> 01:10.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:16.368 --> 01:17.201
- Once upon a time,

01:17.201 --> 01:18.872
there was a story of a cat and a dog.

01:20.381 --> 01:23.300
One day, you might be in line
to take over for Kaeluss.

01:23.300 --> 01:24.483
Do you really think so?

01:24.483 --> 01:26.712
- Trust me, I'm school president.

01:27.545 --> 01:28.980
Nice work, Deja

01:28.980 --> 01:29.813
- Thank you, sir.

01:29.813 --> 01:32.230
It's not work if you love it.

01:35.749 --> 01:37.691
What's taking so long?

01:37.691 --> 01:38.524
Going as fast as I can.

01:38.524 --> 01:40.631
Just keep an eye out for Principal Hughes.

01:40.631 --> 01:42.658
I don't know how I let
me talk me into this.

01:42.658 --> 01:43.491
Stop it!

01:43.491 --> 01:44.415
The therapist said it's not healthy for me

01:44.415 --> 01:45.331
to argue with myself.

01:46.592 --> 01:48.413
Just gotta make sure I'm the
first one to meet Kaeluss.

01:48.413 --> 01:49.310
Do you see anyone?

01:52.976 --> 01:54.938
Look, I sorry I got mad.

01:54.938 --> 01:55.940
You know I respect me.

01:57.808 --> 01:59.141
Don't go silent.

02:01.591 --> 02:02.674
Where'd I go?

02:09.536 --> 02:11.264
Sir, I'm just,

02:11.264 --> 02:13.847
it's not what it looks like, I.

02:22.584 --> 02:25.374
- Come on, Deja. Pull yourself together.

02:27.044 --> 02:29.544
You'll laugh about that later.

02:47.395 --> 02:48.938
- Wait a minute,

02:48.938 --> 02:52.010
these 40 lunches aren't mine.

02:52.010 --> 02:54.843
But where did I put my 40 lunches?

02:56.966 --> 02:58.603
Can I still eat these though?

03:03.720 --> 03:06.819
- Destroying personal property,

03:06.819 --> 03:09.480
throwing a teacher's car,

03:09.480 --> 03:11.063
throwing a teacher,

03:12.958 --> 03:14.791
and destroying a desk.

03:18.010 --> 03:20.926
Anything you wanna say for yourself?

03:26.174 --> 03:27.757
Destroying my desk.

03:29.835 --> 03:31.953
Don't mess with the bull young man,

03:31.953 --> 03:33.703
you'll get the horns.

03:45.362 --> 03:46.572
She's so pretty.

03:46.572 --> 03:49.489
I bet Kaeluss chooses her for sure.

03:56.449 --> 03:58.905
- There she is, boys.

03:58.905 --> 04:01.322
The whale of Kaeluss Academy.

04:02.179 --> 04:06.412
What do you say, Liv? You
wanna be my Moby Dick?

04:06.412 --> 04:07.663
- Sorry Jeff,

04:07.663 --> 04:10.352
I'm not into guys who
play with their harpoons.

04:20.356 --> 04:23.543
Get it off me!

04:23.543 --> 04:24.477
Come on.

04:24.477 --> 04:25.840
- And word of advice,

04:25.840 --> 04:27.826
girls don't like being compared to whales.

04:27.826 --> 04:29.166
- Okay, okay!

04:29.166 --> 04:31.999
Help me.

04:34.613 --> 04:36.493
Go do something!

04:46.961 --> 04:47.794
Sir.

04:54.855 --> 04:56.609
Okay, please don't be Mr. Kent.

04:56.609 --> 04:58.551
Please don't be Mr. Kent.

04:58.551 --> 05:00.054
And be ready for Mr. Kent.

05:00.054 --> 05:01.846
Okay, please don't, hey!

05:01.846 --> 05:02.679
Who mopped the floor?

05:02.679 --> 05:04.979
I specifically said no
mopping the floor today!

05:04.979 --> 05:06.447
Okay, I'm coming!

05:06.447 --> 05:08.179
Oh please don't be Mr. Kent.

05:08.179 --> 05:09.372
Please don't be Mr. Kent!

05:09.372 --> 05:13.539
Please don't be Mr. Kent.

05:17.125 --> 05:19.384
Good morning Mr. Kent!

05:19.384 --> 05:20.606
You uh,

05:20.606 --> 05:22.958
caught me by surprise.

05:22.958 --> 05:25.247
I was just having some last minute

05:26.956 --> 05:30.409
paintings done up for Kaeluss's arrival.

05:30.409 --> 05:32.576
- You have paintings done?

05:34.172 --> 05:35.005
- You know what?

05:35.005 --> 05:38.250
I'm gonna stop this before it snowballs.

05:38.250 --> 05:41.000
I'm just, just very out of shape.

05:42.620 --> 05:43.891
- Mr. Hughes,

05:43.891 --> 05:45.271
when I ran that school,

05:45.271 --> 05:49.998
I made it a priority to be
in the best shape of my life

05:49.998 --> 05:54.153
to teach the kids the
importance of physicality.

05:54.153 --> 05:56.240
- I'm not sure you've mentioned
that before, have you?

05:56.240 --> 05:57.715
- Oh, I'm sorry.

05:57.715 --> 06:00.055
Is my diligence bothering you?

06:00.055 --> 06:02.384
I guess I figured that
since Kaeluss is coming down

06:02.384 --> 06:04.195
to pick his successor,

06:04.195 --> 06:08.848
we should at least look
as if we are prepared.

06:08.848 --> 06:10.863
- Yes, sir. We are.

06:10.863 --> 06:15.030
You know, just sorting out
a few last minute details.

06:15.978 --> 06:17.648
Details?

06:17.648 --> 06:18.502
Yep,
nothing to worry about.

06:18.502 --> 06:22.085
Just typical teenage
angsty kind of things.

06:25.280 --> 06:29.447
- Now, let me give you my 43
plan for a successful day.

06:32.359 --> 06:33.343
- Of course.

06:33.343 --> 06:36.354
Nobody appreciates
those 43 point plans

06:36.354 --> 06:37.630
like me, sir.

06:37.630 --> 06:39.467
Uh, let me just grab a pen.

06:39.467 --> 06:42.128
I know I have one around here.

06:42.128 --> 06:43.389
I think I just put it,

06:43.389 --> 06:45.714
uh, hey.

06:45.714 --> 06:48.014
No thank you, you old fart.

06:48.014 --> 06:49.512
That was the wrong button,

06:49.512 --> 06:51.262
I can still hear you.

06:52.550 --> 06:54.587
Sir,

06:54.587 --> 06:56.637
- Uh huh.
- It's a funny thing, um,

06:56.637 --> 06:59.213
old fart is what all the cool
kids are saying these days

06:59.213 --> 07:00.046
like "What up, my old--"

07:00.046 --> 07:03.537
Just make sure
you do your job, old fart.

07:03.537 --> 07:05.787
- Yes. Okay, thank you sir.

07:11.587 --> 07:14.160
That is going to come up again.

07:27.112 --> 07:31.523
Can't believe this is happening.

07:31.523 --> 07:34.122
I ruined my whole life.

07:34.122 --> 07:37.050
- Relax. It's one day.

07:37.050 --> 07:38.537
- It's the day.

07:38.537 --> 07:40.860
He's coming to pick somebody
and I'm stuck in here.

07:40.860 --> 07:42.287
- Who cares?

07:42.287 --> 07:43.673
That sellout represents everything

07:43.673 --> 07:45.560
that's wrong with abilities anyway.

07:45.560 --> 07:46.687
- Just because protecting the world

07:46.687 --> 07:47.798
comes with money and fame,

07:47.798 --> 07:49.583
doesn't make you a sellout.

07:49.583 --> 07:51.378
- Spare us your fake values, drama queen.

07:52.764 --> 07:54.840
- Show you how fake I can be.

07:54.840 --> 07:55.673
- Try it.

07:56.506 --> 07:57.464
I'd like to see what
sleeping beauty over there

07:57.464 --> 07:58.631
can do anyway.

08:00.506 --> 08:01.470
- Oh, cat fight!

08:02.682 --> 08:04.469
Oh, wait a minute. Was that sexist?

08:04.469 --> 08:06.678
Oh I'm sorry. I just started here.

08:06.678 --> 08:09.315
I don't know any of your abilities.

08:09.315 --> 08:10.642
I actually kinda hope one of you turns

08:10.642 --> 08:11.821
into a giant cat now

08:11.821 --> 08:14.321
so I don't seem like that guy.

08:15.872 --> 08:18.455
- Uh, take a seat please girls.

08:20.703 --> 08:21.536
Okay!

08:22.901 --> 08:23.734
As you all know,

08:23.734 --> 08:25.258
today is a very important day

08:25.258 --> 08:27.453
and you're here because

08:27.453 --> 08:31.620
you've all proven that you
can't act like civilized heroes.

08:33.490 --> 08:34.323
- Liv? Yes?

08:34.323 --> 08:37.893
- What are we supposed to do all day?

08:37.893 --> 08:40.181
- Don't care. Honestly.

08:40.181 --> 08:43.344
You can do whatever you want
as long as you do it in here.

08:43.344 --> 08:45.497
You can catch up on your homework,

08:45.497 --> 08:47.564
think about what brought you here,

08:47.564 --> 08:51.826
or uh, yeah, take a lap
like Lunam over there.

08:51.826 --> 08:53.987
That's fine, you can do that.

08:56.483 --> 08:57.361
Decided I'm gonna put the effort

08:57.361 --> 08:59.344
into the kids who deserve this day.

09:00.922 --> 09:02.130
Frankly I'm a little tired of

09:02.130 --> 09:05.239
fixing the squeaky wheel all the time.

09:05.239 --> 09:09.515
- Wait, does one of you turn into a wheel?

09:11.783 --> 09:14.033
- Okay, I still have a lot.

09:33.234 --> 09:35.158
- What are you doing?

09:35.158 --> 09:38.325
- What does it look like? I'm leaving.

09:39.169 --> 09:41.081
- Oh I'm pretty sure Principal
Hughes was clear on us

09:41.081 --> 09:43.044
staying in here for the day.

09:43.044 --> 09:44.668
For all we know, this is a test.

09:44.668 --> 09:47.894
If we do as we're told,
we can still meet him.

09:47.894 --> 09:48.811
- Who's in?

09:51.633 --> 09:54.307
- Better than sitting in here all day.

09:54.307 --> 09:56.868
- Can we grab a bite to eat?

09:56.868 --> 09:58.757
- Why not instead we make a list of ways

09:58.757 --> 10:00.717
we can better improve ourselves?

10:00.717 --> 10:01.884
I'll go first.

10:02.942 --> 10:04.707
I can brush my teeth more.

10:04.707 --> 10:06.383
- Andrasta, how about you?

10:06.383 --> 10:08.243
- Man this thing is really tight.

10:08.243 --> 10:10.743
- You're doing it wrong. Move.

10:14.116 --> 10:16.006
- Well hello there!

10:16.006 --> 10:17.957
They call me Metabolism.

10:17.957 --> 10:20.356
I just transferred here and anyways,

10:20.356 --> 10:23.662
my mom said I should try
and make some new friends.

10:23.662 --> 10:25.591
- Great story kid.

10:25.591 --> 10:27.189
Sure it took a lot of courage
for someone who looks like you

10:27.189 --> 10:28.672
to talk to someone who looks like me,

10:28.672 --> 10:30.749
but I will save you some effort.

10:30.749 --> 10:31.986
I'm out of your league.

10:31.986 --> 10:36.049
I'm into older or bigger, muscular guys.

10:36.049 --> 10:36.882
- Well,

10:38.261 --> 10:41.388
my mom always says the
worst they can say is no.

10:41.388 --> 10:43.225
Guess I'll call her

10:43.225 --> 10:45.986
and let her know she was wrong.

10:45.986 --> 10:48.635
- Move, I'll summon a monster
on the other side of the door.

10:48.635 --> 10:51.061
Okay, relax pageant queen.

10:51.061 --> 10:52.482
I'm gonna try to find a
way to the other side.

10:52.482 --> 10:55.806
- No one cares about your
little puppet strings, okay?

10:58.863 --> 11:00.276
- He locked it.

11:04.916 --> 11:05.916
- You think?

11:07.428 --> 11:09.927
- That's his ability. He locks things.

11:09.927 --> 11:11.427
- How do you know?

11:12.324 --> 11:15.241
- I think he, um, comes here a lot.

11:28.157 --> 11:30.824
- Alright students. Settle down.

11:33.739 --> 11:34.572
Alright.

11:35.639 --> 11:36.472
Franklin.

11:38.290 --> 11:40.720
Claire? Claire, come on.

11:40.720 --> 11:41.887
- Settle down!

11:45.390 --> 11:46.390
- Thank you.

11:48.586 --> 11:49.419
Students,

11:51.706 --> 11:54.833
I don't need to tell you
how important today is.

11:54.833 --> 11:57.088
This is the most important
day in our school's history,

11:57.088 --> 11:58.255
you know that.

11:59.220 --> 12:01.076
Someone here is going to be

12:01.076 --> 12:04.304
given the greatest
honor a hero can receive

12:04.304 --> 12:08.433
and you've all worked
extremely hard for this.

12:08.433 --> 12:11.100
I'm so proud of you. All of you.

12:12.348 --> 12:14.479
I want you to know

12:14.479 --> 12:17.742
no matter which one of you is chosen,

12:17.742 --> 12:21.351
every one of you in this room is my hero.

12:24.204 --> 12:25.491
- He's here.

12:27.221 --> 12:28.054
- Oh.

12:29.017 --> 12:30.654
Claire, how do I look?

12:30.654 --> 12:33.620
New tie? Okay? Okay.

13:01.908 --> 13:03.408
- Clear for entry.

13:08.809 --> 13:10.796
- Good to be back.

13:10.796 --> 13:13.463
- Welcome to--
- Principal Hugs.

13:15.776 --> 13:18.548
- Ms. Potter, Kaeluss's
personal assistant.

13:18.548 --> 13:21.430
And I believe it's Mr. Hughes, yes?

13:21.430 --> 13:24.597
- No, he's right. It's Principal Hugs.

13:25.634 --> 13:26.467
Please!

13:44.296 --> 13:45.987
- That's it.

13:45.987 --> 13:46.820
I officially missed it.

13:46.820 --> 13:48.971
Way to go, Deja!

13:48.971 --> 13:50.388
Nice work, moron!

13:52.245 --> 13:54.719
- Hey, quit being so hard on yourself.

13:54.719 --> 13:55.636
Yourselves.

13:56.875 --> 13:58.124
Do we use plural?

13:58.124 --> 13:59.124
- This is so stupid,

13:59.124 --> 14:01.513
I should be out there getting picked.

14:01.513 --> 14:02.800
- What a shock.

14:02.800 --> 14:04.178
Liv assumes another thing
will be handed to her

14:04.178 --> 14:05.920
on a silver platter.

14:05.920 --> 14:07.775
- I don't need anything handed to me.

14:07.775 --> 14:08.830
My ability makes me more powerful

14:08.830 --> 14:10.869
than anyone in this school.

14:13.773 --> 14:14.986
- Something to say?

14:14.986 --> 14:16.554
Or do you just grunt?

14:16.554 --> 14:20.054
- You have no idea what you're asking for,

14:21.303 --> 14:22.136
princess.

14:33.584 --> 14:34.745
- Are you kidding me?

14:34.745 --> 14:38.739
- I'm sorry, us princesses
can be so clumsy.

14:40.604 --> 14:42.224
- What is your problem?

14:42.224 --> 14:43.433
You could've killed me!

14:43.433 --> 14:45.551
- Whoa, I don't want
anything to do with this.

14:54.315 --> 14:56.345
- You have a fantastic
school here, Mr. Hughes.

14:56.345 --> 14:58.068
- Oh! Thank you very much!

14:58.068 --> 15:00.045
Yeah. We like it, you know.

15:00.045 --> 15:01.764
And I always say

15:01.764 --> 15:03.606
work hard and you will hardly work.

15:03.606 --> 15:05.332
- Is that so?

15:05.332 --> 15:07.652
- I actually have no
idea. I just made that up.

15:07.652 --> 15:10.170
I'm very nervous. I'm
just trying not to vomit.

15:10.170 --> 15:11.534
- Please don't.

15:11.534 --> 15:12.945
Nothing to be nervous about.

15:12.945 --> 15:15.730
Kaeluss has been looking forward to this.

15:15.730 --> 15:18.880
- It's okay, I've got it under control.

15:18.880 --> 15:22.880
Key is to smile. It
suppresses the gag reflexes.

15:25.344 --> 15:27.286
These, uh, your people?

15:27.286 --> 15:28.408
- Oh yes.

15:28.408 --> 15:31.956
Just a few members of
Kaeluss's security team.

15:31.956 --> 15:32.789
- That's funny.

15:32.789 --> 15:35.992
The most powerful man on Earth
needs security.

15:35.992 --> 15:38.811
- Honestly, they mostly handle fans.

15:38.811 --> 15:41.155
Don't even
get me started on fans.

15:41.155 --> 15:42.895
I was a fan one time and--

15:47.882 --> 15:48.715
I was reading this book,

15:48.715 --> 15:51.012
it's talking about love at first sight.

15:51.012 --> 15:53.219
I don't know if I believe in all that.

15:58.461 --> 15:59.564
Where
would you like this ma'am?

16:02.128 --> 16:05.972
- Just place it on the stage, please Able?

16:05.972 --> 16:07.586
Part of security as well?

16:07.586 --> 16:08.834
- That is the exam.

16:08.834 --> 16:11.343
It was designed to analyze
each student's abilities

16:11.343 --> 16:13.643
to help narrow down a choice for Kaeluss.

16:13.643 --> 16:15.393
- Oh. Very high tech.

16:16.517 --> 16:17.350
I would be helpful

16:17.350 --> 16:19.534
if I got the students to start right away.

16:19.534 --> 16:21.873
- That would be super duper.

16:21.873 --> 16:23.099
Just tell them to place their hand on it

16:23.099 --> 16:24.773
and the exam will do the rest.

16:24.773 --> 16:26.106
- Piece of cake.

16:35.608 --> 16:38.296
- Students, the time has come.

16:38.296 --> 16:41.633
One at a time, we are
gonna form an orderly line.

16:41.633 --> 16:45.581
And we are going to calmly place our hands

16:45.581 --> 16:47.316
onto the machine.

16:47.316 --> 16:49.060
This will help Kaeluss pick a successor.

16:49.060 --> 16:50.601
I don't, one at a time.

16:50.601 --> 16:53.573
Holly! We don't have the perfect oasis!

16:53.573 --> 16:56.323
Don't!

17:01.258 --> 17:03.457
I wouldn't worry about that,

17:03.457 --> 17:06.180
Ms. Potter built that exam herself.

17:06.180 --> 17:07.747
- Mr. Kaeluss, uh,

17:07.747 --> 17:09.445
I didn't get a chance earlier
when you were outside.

17:09.445 --> 17:13.412
I just want to say what a
honor it is to meet you.

17:13.412 --> 17:15.002
- You know this school has come a long way

17:15.002 --> 17:18.026
since that old coot Mr. Kent ran it.

17:24.838 --> 17:27.506
I wish I had recorded you saying that.

17:27.506 --> 17:30.589
Oh, it would've made a good ringtone.

17:31.989 --> 17:32.822
- Uh Ms. Potter,

17:32.822 --> 17:34.355
I assume everything's ready?

17:34.355 --> 17:36.838
I'd hate to see a media
mob ruin a glorious moment.

17:38.201 --> 17:39.775
- Yes sir.

17:39.775 --> 17:40.749
- Oh! You guys,

17:40.749 --> 17:41.664
you don't have to worry about the media,

17:41.664 --> 17:43.212
we're very isolated out here

17:43.212 --> 17:44.870
for security purposes, so.

17:44.870 --> 17:46.936
We do even have an internet
connection or anything

17:46.936 --> 17:48.269
except in my office,

17:48.269 --> 17:51.033
which, of course, either
of you are free to use.

17:51.033 --> 17:54.390
Mi office es su office, es your office-o.

17:54.390 --> 17:56.064
So, whatever you need!

17:56.064 --> 17:58.981
- You are too kind, Principal Hugs.

18:00.155 --> 18:02.055
- Said my name.

18:03.138 --> 18:04.471
- What was that?

18:05.830 --> 18:07.727
- Um, you know what?

18:07.727 --> 18:09.790
We've been having some plumbing issues.

18:09.790 --> 18:11.377
Recently, you know, uh,

18:11.377 --> 18:14.918
kids with abilities and
cafeteria fiber just.

18:14.918 --> 18:17.092
Uh, I'm gonna go check it out.

18:17.092 --> 18:19.005
You two go ahead, just
get started and, uh,

18:19.005 --> 18:20.883
just, I'll be right back.

18:20.883 --> 18:21.716
- Are you sure?

18:21.716 --> 18:24.568
Absolutely,
absolutely. Go ahead.

18:30.145 --> 18:31.311
- Should we get started?

18:31.311 --> 18:32.394
- Absolutely.

18:46.219 --> 18:47.052
- What is this?

18:53.269 --> 18:56.134
- Oh! Had the craziest dream.

18:56.134 --> 18:59.542
I was like in detention and I, I,

18:59.542 --> 19:01.042
okay, not a dream.

19:02.038 --> 19:05.168
Okay, at least I'm not naked.

19:05.168 --> 19:06.884
- Sir I just wanted to say that
I actually wasn't involved--

19:06.884 --> 19:07.801
- Sit down!

19:10.363 --> 19:11.280
All of you.

19:23.357 --> 19:24.228
So it's not enough that you have to

19:24.228 --> 19:25.148
ruin the day for yourselves,

19:25.148 --> 19:28.608
now you have to ruin it for me too?

19:31.185 --> 19:33.118
Glad you think that's funny

19:33.118 --> 19:35.059
'cause now I'm gonna be down
here babysitting all day.

19:35.059 --> 19:37.642
I'm gonna miss the whole visit.

19:45.544 --> 19:49.694
Anybody think maybe I
would've enjoyed today?

19:49.694 --> 19:52.720
Maybe would've been a lot of fun for me?

19:52.720 --> 19:55.781
- Sir, maybe we were
looking forward for today.

19:55.781 --> 19:57.314
- You know what? Save it.

19:57.314 --> 20:01.481
I'm just gonna do my head down
and feel sorry for myself.

20:16.850 --> 20:18.760
- All the students have applied.

20:18.760 --> 20:20.228
- Perfect.

20:43.706 --> 20:44.628
- Legacy.

20:46.681 --> 20:48.181
What does it mean?

20:49.603 --> 20:53.115
Is it about what we leave behind?

20:53.115 --> 20:55.653
Or is it about setting the path

20:55.653 --> 20:57.986
for the next hero to follow?

21:00.229 --> 21:02.725
I look around this room

21:02.725 --> 21:06.261
and I see so many heroes ready to step up,

21:06.261 --> 21:08.594
take over where I leave off.

21:10.323 --> 21:13.603
Maybe even one of your teachers.

21:13.603 --> 21:15.353
Have you applied yet?

21:16.751 --> 21:18.426
- Um, no sir.

21:18.426 --> 21:19.374
- Well why not?

21:19.374 --> 21:21.039
I mean teachers included.

21:21.039 --> 21:23.210
Don't count yourself short. Step up!

21:23.210 --> 21:26.083
What do you say students?
Should your teachers apply?

21:29.092 --> 21:30.009
Come on up!

21:36.314 --> 21:38.134
When I started here,

21:38.134 --> 21:41.114
we were the first with abilities.

21:41.114 --> 21:45.281
And with each generation, we
grow more and more powerful.

21:46.534 --> 21:49.746
There's more power in this room today

21:49.746 --> 21:52.413
than there ever has been before.

21:54.361 --> 21:57.611
But who wants to hear me make a speech?

21:58.632 --> 21:59.799
Let's find out

22:01.058 --> 22:02.265
who is my replacement.

22:09.980 --> 22:12.868
Now when I press this button,

22:12.868 --> 22:16.139
the exam is gonna run its program

22:16.139 --> 22:19.890
and tell us the mightiest hero that's

22:19.890 --> 22:21.723
worthy of taking over.

22:25.541 --> 22:28.291
In just a few seconds we'll know.

22:31.690 --> 22:32.523
It's done.

22:35.983 --> 22:39.729
And the hero best suited

22:39.729 --> 22:42.729
to take my place is

22:45.881 --> 22:46.937
me.

22:51.536 --> 22:53.891
What's going on here?

22:53.891 --> 22:58.141
- What's going on is
I'm not stepping down.

22:58.141 --> 23:00.308
No one is taking my place!

23:01.171 --> 23:04.171
From now on, I rule over all of you!

23:05.134 --> 23:07.560
- We're not just gonna stand
by and let you do this!

23:09.925 --> 23:12.005
- Oh, what's wrong?

23:12.005 --> 23:13.847
Your abilities not working?

23:13.847 --> 23:14.686
How could that have happened?

23:14.686 --> 23:15.802
Oh! Oh, wait!

23:15.802 --> 23:19.144
You voluntarily gave them to me!

23:19.144 --> 23:23.695
You couldn't
have made it more easy!

23:23.695 --> 23:27.346
You literally brought every
kid in the world with abilities

23:27.346 --> 23:29.936
and put them in one room!

23:29.936 --> 23:31.770
Thank you for that, by the way.

23:31.770 --> 23:33.853
- Why are you doing this?

23:35.046 --> 23:37.463
- Because I am sick and tired

23:38.818 --> 23:42.458
of listening to men tell me where to go

23:42.458 --> 23:44.458
and who to fight.

23:44.458 --> 23:45.791
I am the future!

23:48.514 --> 23:50.514
Now don't be frightened.

23:52.767 --> 23:54.517
Hey, don't be scared.

23:55.524 --> 23:59.361
While my people transform this
place into my new fortress,

23:59.361 --> 24:02.954
you're kinda like my first guests.

24:02.954 --> 24:04.295
Maybe I should say hostages

24:04.295 --> 24:06.769
but eh, to-may-toe, to-mah-toe.

24:06.769 --> 24:08.364
Lock it down.

24:18.083 --> 24:21.072
- It's gotta be over by now, right?

24:21.072 --> 24:23.129
- Who do you think got it?

24:23.129 --> 24:25.639
- Who cares? It's not me.

24:29.350 --> 24:30.183
- Well done, sir.

24:30.183 --> 24:31.294
- Thank you, Ms. Potter.

24:32.462 --> 24:33.582
- Security has sealed the doors,

24:33.582 --> 24:35.388
nobody can get in or out.

24:35.388 --> 24:38.039
I check today's attendance and
all the kids came to school.

24:38.039 --> 24:39.964
- No doubt to see me, of course.

24:39.964 --> 24:41.297
- No doubt, sir.

24:56.701 --> 24:57.534
- Perfect.

24:58.403 --> 25:00.317
Perfect, perfect.

25:00.317 --> 25:04.487
Perfect plans make me
very happy, Ms. Potter.

25:04.487 --> 25:06.034
- Um, I, um.

25:07.712 --> 25:10.402
- Well I don't like "Um".

25:10.402 --> 25:13.759
"Um" is what comes before an excuse.

25:13.759 --> 25:15.998
- It's just the computer
showing 316 students

25:15.998 --> 25:17.582
in the school today.

25:17.582 --> 25:19.867
- Here comes that "Um".

25:19.867 --> 25:23.200
- The exams only recording 310 captured.

25:24.380 --> 25:25.999
Where are the other six?

25:31.014 --> 25:32.014
- Detention.

25:34.041 --> 25:35.116
Sir, I can send a team down.

25:35.116 --> 25:36.610
We'll use the element of surprise.

25:36.610 --> 25:38.110
- No, no. No need.

25:40.171 --> 25:44.241
You catch more flies with
honey than vinegar, Ms. Potter.

25:44.241 --> 25:46.574
- I'm not sure I understand.

25:52.089 --> 25:54.755
- Let's give them what they want.

25:54.755 --> 25:58.320
We'll send them a personal
invitation to meet their hero.

25:58.320 --> 26:02.192
They're gonna fight over
who gets to go first.

26:02.192 --> 26:03.275
- Understood.

26:04.504 --> 26:08.671
- Candy you take from a
baby is always the sweetest.

26:28.330 --> 26:29.913
- Principal Hughes.

26:30.761 --> 26:35.417
Was Mr. Kaeluss deciding
solely on abilities or

26:35.417 --> 26:39.167
were they taking grades
into account as well?

26:40.363 --> 26:42.335
- I don't know.

26:42.335 --> 26:43.867
They had a testing unit they designed,

26:43.867 --> 26:47.285
so I guess is it favored abilities.

26:47.285 --> 26:48.118
- Oh.

26:51.341 --> 26:53.185
- You would've stood a good chance.

26:54.447 --> 26:55.771
- You think?

26:55.771 --> 26:57.354
- You all would've.

26:58.588 --> 27:01.834
Opportunity is not just about
being ready at the right time,

27:01.834 --> 27:04.416
it's about being ready all the time.

27:05.589 --> 27:06.528
Scoff if you like,

27:06.528 --> 27:10.855
but someone in that auditorium
just proved me right.

27:10.855 --> 27:13.639
- Hey, who has the most
powerful ability in the school?

27:13.639 --> 27:15.837
That's impossible to say.

27:15.837 --> 27:17.279
- Come on, that's lame.

27:17.279 --> 27:18.163
That's like when you ask your parents

27:18.163 --> 27:22.053
which kid they love
most and they say both.

27:22.053 --> 27:25.469
- Learned a little bit
about Andrasta here.

27:25.469 --> 27:28.707
- It's not. I mean, take
Liv here for example.

27:28.707 --> 27:30.243
She can summon demons from any shadow.

27:30.243 --> 27:32.526
That's extremely powerful.

27:32.526 --> 27:33.526
- Thank you.

27:35.569 --> 27:37.902
- But no shadow, no ability.

27:39.221 --> 27:41.883
It's not about your abilities.

27:41.883 --> 27:45.453
It's about you, plain and simple.

27:51.523 --> 27:52.440
Ms. Potter!

27:54.161 --> 27:56.162
Is, uh, is everything okay?

27:56.162 --> 27:57.427
- Of course.

27:57.427 --> 27:58.260
But as it turns out,

27:58.260 --> 27:59.985
Kaeluss is not willing to name a successor

27:59.985 --> 28:01.961
until he sees the whole school.

28:01.961 --> 28:03.327
So he's extended a personal invitation

28:03.327 --> 28:05.539
for these students to be tested.

28:05.539 --> 28:06.565
- We still have a chance!

28:06.565 --> 28:07.879
I knew it!

28:08.712 --> 28:09.848
- You sure do.

28:09.848 --> 28:11.148
Come on, kids.

28:11.148 --> 28:11.981
- Uh,

28:13.729 --> 28:15.159
I'm afraid that's out of the question.

28:15.159 --> 28:19.163
These students have to
remain in detention.

28:19.163 --> 28:20.203
- Please Principal Hughes.

28:20.203 --> 28:22.846
This is a second chance.

28:22.846 --> 28:25.952
- Kaeluss asked for you yourself
to be there, Mr. Hughes.

28:25.952 --> 28:28.694
He said that he may even choose you.

28:33.388 --> 28:34.221
- I'm sorry,

28:34.221 --> 28:38.275
I wouldn't be much of a principal
if I went back on my word.

28:38.275 --> 28:41.025
You're gonna have to tell him no.

28:46.880 --> 28:48.078
- I guess we go with vinegar.

28:51.440 --> 28:52.452
I can't see!

28:52.452 --> 28:53.544
- Oh, lady!

28:53.544 --> 28:54.546
What are you doing?

28:54.546 --> 28:56.026
- All of you come with me now.

28:56.026 --> 28:57.888
- You're hurting him!

28:57.888 --> 29:00.162
- I suggest you do as I say
and make the right choice.

29:00.162 --> 29:01.079
- Hey lady,

29:02.007 --> 29:03.024
we're the bad kids.

29:06.226 --> 29:08.687
We never make the right choice.

29:08.687 --> 29:10.850
- Woah! Action movie line guy.

29:10.850 --> 29:12.623
That's what they should call you.

29:12.623 --> 29:14.350
What happened?

29:14.350 --> 29:15.622
- Sir, she hit you with something.

29:15.622 --> 29:16.786
And she said we had to go see Kaeluss.

29:16.786 --> 29:19.362
- Why would she do that?
It doesn't make sense.

29:19.362 --> 29:20.195
- I got this.

29:27.610 --> 29:29.610
Tell us what's going on.

29:32.572 --> 29:33.727
- Kaeluss has stolen the abilities

29:33.727 --> 29:35.939
of everyone in the school.

29:35.939 --> 29:38.125
He just need yours to complete phase one.

29:38.125 --> 29:38.958
- No way.

29:40.462 --> 29:42.636
- Kaeluss doesn't want
anyone to succeed him.

29:42.636 --> 29:43.978
Stealing your abilities is the only way

29:43.978 --> 29:48.707
to ensure that he will be
the only ability out there.

29:48.707 --> 29:50.395
- Does she have to talk like that?

29:50.395 --> 29:52.721
I mean, she sounds so robotic.

29:52.721 --> 29:54.293
- No, I can switch it.

29:54.293 --> 29:55.126
Oh yeah?

29:55.959 --> 29:57.739
- His guards have locked down the school

29:57.739 --> 30:00.668
to keep anyone from getting in or out.

30:00.668 --> 30:01.501
He'll take over the world

30:01.501 --> 30:04.874
and crush anyone that gets in his way.

30:04.874 --> 30:06.551
- I don't like that voice.

30:06.551 --> 30:08.466
- Yeah, change it.

30:08.466 --> 30:10.755
- Guys, please. This isn't helping.

30:10.755 --> 30:12.627
- Make her do an accent.

30:13.460 --> 30:14.471
- Even when the world surrenders,

30:14.471 --> 30:15.996
Kaeluss will wipe out the entire school

30:15.996 --> 30:17.788
as a show of ability.

30:17.788 --> 30:20.350
- Eliminate the whole school?

30:20.350 --> 30:23.430
- Yeah, she just said that.

30:23.430 --> 30:26.562
Man, they should call you Deja Vu!

30:26.562 --> 30:27.395
- They do.

30:29.319 --> 30:30.152
- Oh.

30:33.476 --> 30:35.724
So what do we do?

30:35.724 --> 30:38.038
- Okay, I gotta get you guys out of here.

30:38.038 --> 30:40.936
I can unlock the doors
if I can get to them.

30:40.936 --> 30:42.354
- We can't run.

30:42.354 --> 30:44.046
We have to go in there and fight them,

30:44.046 --> 30:45.294
take them down.

30:45.294 --> 30:47.202
- Says the peacekeeper.

30:47.202 --> 30:49.437
- Don't include me.

30:49.437 --> 30:51.246
- There's guards everywhere.

30:51.246 --> 30:52.262
They'll rip you apart.

30:52.262 --> 30:54.095
- I can handle guards.

30:54.990 --> 30:56.928
- Alright. Everyone stop.

30:56.928 --> 30:58.994
Alright? No one's fighting.

30:58.994 --> 31:01.269
I'm gonna get you kids to safety,

31:01.269 --> 31:03.536
I'll get word to Mr. Kent

31:03.536 --> 31:05.703
and he can send some help.

31:07.266 --> 31:08.930
- Sir, you can't do that alone.

31:08.930 --> 31:10.230
- You said it yourself.

31:10.230 --> 31:12.858
It's about being ready all the time.

31:12.858 --> 31:13.858
We're ready.

31:17.171 --> 31:20.269
- I can't put you in harm's way.

31:21.102 --> 31:22.443
- I have a way that we can stay safe

31:22.443 --> 31:24.807
and rescue the students.

31:24.807 --> 31:25.640
Andrasta?

31:26.613 --> 31:27.692
We need to find out everything we can

31:27.692 --> 31:29.898
about this machine.

31:29.898 --> 31:30.731
- On it.

31:34.203 --> 31:36.505
Pretty brave.

31:36.505 --> 31:38.475
- I'm the president.

31:38.475 --> 31:39.558
Took an oath.

31:41.629 --> 31:44.114
- I was just about to say I had a plan

31:44.114 --> 31:46.427
to stay safe and rescue people.

31:46.427 --> 31:47.897
I actually think he's got some sort of

31:47.897 --> 31:49.335
idea stealing ability.

31:53.035 --> 31:54.179
You know,

31:54.179 --> 31:57.429
you gotta stop throwing yourself at me.

32:09.004 --> 32:12.421
- How long does it take to find six kids?

32:24.691 --> 32:25.524
- Okay,

32:26.718 --> 32:29.218
do you know what you're doing?

32:30.307 --> 32:31.140
Alright.

32:33.579 --> 32:35.587
Okay. You sure you're up for this?

32:35.587 --> 32:38.263
This isn't a test sorta thing.

32:38.263 --> 32:39.473
- No problem.

32:39.473 --> 32:41.487
Just unlock the door and get the word out.

32:41.487 --> 32:43.997
We'll take care of the rest.

32:43.997 --> 32:44.830
- Alright.

32:47.339 --> 32:48.172
Hey,

32:49.570 --> 32:51.487
they're gonna need you.

32:52.321 --> 32:53.654
- Not my battle.

32:57.234 --> 33:00.651
- Pretty easy to win the fights you pick.

33:01.993 --> 33:04.688
- I'll get them to the auditorium.

33:04.688 --> 33:06.855
Then they're on their own.

33:09.693 --> 33:11.929
Okay,

33:11.929 --> 33:13.243
good luck.

33:13.243 --> 33:15.243
I believe in all of you.

33:35.638 --> 33:38.305
It's okay, got it under control.

33:50.535 --> 33:53.745
And up we go!

33:53.745 --> 33:54.578
We're all good!

33:54.578 --> 33:56.745
I'll just dance myself in.

33:57.687 --> 34:00.429
A little section at a time.

34:00.429 --> 34:04.346
Any of you have the
ability to create a ladder?

34:10.911 --> 34:13.079
- Okay, let's bring it in.

34:14.969 --> 34:17.302
- I don't do huddles, sport.

34:19.663 --> 34:21.521
- Everyone's counting on us.

34:21.521 --> 34:23.835
Now I know today we screwed up,

34:23.835 --> 34:26.156
but this is our time to show them

34:26.156 --> 34:27.942
that they were wrong.

34:27.942 --> 34:30.039
So let's get up there and kick some butt!

34:30.039 --> 34:31.371
- Good pep talk.

34:34.538 --> 34:36.205
Sorry, I was asleep.

34:37.292 --> 34:39.292
No idea what's going on.

34:43.134 --> 34:44.942
- Gotta get to my office.

34:44.942 --> 34:49.174
Keep going at it. Come on.

34:49.174 --> 34:51.424
Okay, use this as a lesson.

34:52.658 --> 34:53.657
What have I learned?

34:53.657 --> 34:55.543
I have learned I am

34:55.543 --> 34:58.259
quite claustrophobic.

34:58.259 --> 35:02.902
Power through,
Hughes. Power through!

35:02.902 --> 35:05.086
I'll have a nice pickle.

35:05.086 --> 35:09.253
I'm a claustrophobic to most.

35:13.212 --> 35:14.045
- Finally.

35:15.435 --> 35:18.569
- They did not want to come quietly, sir.

35:18.569 --> 35:22.569
Teenagers, so brave.

35:23.859 --> 35:27.276
So rebellious. Ooh, stupid.

35:28.810 --> 35:29.722
And who's this?

35:33.067 --> 35:35.234
- Lunam. She's a werewolf.

35:36.417 --> 35:38.084
- Interesting.

35:38.084 --> 35:41.984
Don't think I ever heard of
a werewolf ability before.

35:41.984 --> 35:43.651
- I'm one of a kind.

35:45.295 --> 35:46.584
- And what did you do to get yourself

35:46.584 --> 35:48.501
locked up in detention?

35:49.718 --> 35:51.056
- I didn't do anything.

35:51.056 --> 35:52.377
They always lock me up on a full moon

35:52.377 --> 35:53.906
for everyone's safety.

35:53.906 --> 35:56.586
My ability is too much for me to control.

35:56.586 --> 35:58.039
The curse only lasts a few minutes,

35:58.039 --> 36:00.053
but it's intense.

36:00.053 --> 36:02.847
- Well let's fix that, shall we?

36:16.787 --> 36:20.037
Well, looks like I would've chosen you.

36:21.509 --> 36:25.679
You know, if this whole
thing wasn't a scam.

36:25.679 --> 36:27.076
- Pretty brave.

36:27.076 --> 36:28.375
What?

36:28.375 --> 36:31.042
- Taking little kid's abilities.

36:33.587 --> 36:34.928
- Young man, if I were to fight you,

36:34.928 --> 36:36.595
I would destroy you.

36:37.920 --> 36:40.690
You should be grateful I'm
only taking your powers.

36:40.690 --> 36:43.099
- This one has an attitude, sir.

36:43.099 --> 36:43.932
- Not for long.

36:45.671 --> 36:48.375
What do you think you're doing?

36:49.831 --> 36:50.789
- Plan b.

36:57.421 --> 36:58.837
- What are you waiting
for? Punch in the code!

36:58.837 --> 36:59.795
- It's not working!

37:00.738 --> 37:02.037
- You probably typed in in wrong.

37:02.037 --> 37:03.287
Tell her again.

37:04.199 --> 37:06.801
- The code is four two three.

37:06.801 --> 37:07.688
- Food! Anybody got food?

37:07.688 --> 37:08.771
Got a sandwich.

37:08.771 --> 37:10.373
- Food? Oh, oh, what is this?

37:12.081 --> 37:13.414
Thank you. Thank you.

37:13.414 --> 37:14.484
Wait. Does this have mustard on it?

37:14.484 --> 37:15.585
Doesn't matter, doesn't matter.

37:15.585 --> 37:16.536
Thank you!

37:17.369 --> 37:18.599
- Liv, get the kids out of here now.

37:18.599 --> 37:19.432
What? No way!

37:19.432 --> 37:23.599
You do it! I'm way better
at fighting than you are!

37:26.137 --> 37:29.049
- Skinny kid's first, huh?

37:30.428 --> 37:33.587
Uh oh. Oh!

37:56.644 --> 37:59.394
- You guys need medical benefits.

38:14.207 --> 38:15.624
- Here, use that.

38:28.231 --> 38:29.552
- It's not working.

38:29.552 --> 38:31.705
I punched it in like three million times!

38:35.983 --> 38:38.070
- Sorry guys, I don't trust
anyone with the real code.

38:38.070 --> 38:39.737
Not even Ms. Potter.

38:45.943 --> 38:46.776
- Help us.

38:49.910 --> 38:51.164
- It's a shame.

38:51.164 --> 38:52.216
Would've really loved to have kept that

38:52.216 --> 38:54.349
puppet thing of yours.

38:58.978 --> 39:00.951
Well, well, well.

39:00.951 --> 39:02.414
Isn't this interesting?

39:04.104 --> 39:04.937
- Get up.

39:07.260 --> 39:09.162
Take the others and leave.

39:09.162 --> 39:10.491
- Are you crazy?

39:10.491 --> 39:12.676
We're not leaving you here to fight him.

39:12.676 --> 39:14.242
- Don't worry about me.

39:14.242 --> 39:17.479
- Sacrificing yourself
for your little friends.

39:17.479 --> 39:18.935
I didn't think you had it in you.

39:18.935 --> 39:20.585
- I'm not sacrificing myself,

39:20.585 --> 39:21.512
I'm gonna punch you in the face

39:21.512 --> 39:23.845
until you don't have a face.

39:24.798 --> 39:26.381
- Aww, now come on.

39:27.318 --> 39:31.640
Doesn't sound like the Klon
that sent me all those letters.

39:31.640 --> 39:33.807
- What's he talking about?

39:35.110 --> 39:37.068
- Eh, go on and tell them Klon.

39:37.068 --> 39:38.701
Tell them how you used
to send me all kinds of--

39:41.590 --> 39:43.382
That's gonna cost you!

39:48.466 --> 39:49.722
Guys run!

39:49.722 --> 39:51.116
- I'm not leaving!

39:55.639 --> 39:56.894
- You're gonna be so mad at me for this.

40:13.395 --> 40:15.312
- Kids these days, huh?

40:39.139 --> 40:41.265
Stay quiet.

40:41.265 --> 40:43.132
- You think the others are alright?

40:43.132 --> 40:44.363
- Yeah.

40:44.363 --> 40:47.946
Hopefully Mr. Hughes
made it to his office.

40:59.879 --> 41:02.443
Alright.

41:02.443 --> 41:04.750
Students might not respect me,

41:04.750 --> 41:06.448
but at least the pay sucks.

41:06.448 --> 41:08.757
- You said we hired the best.

41:08.757 --> 41:11.434
How could you let a bunch
of kids take control.

41:11.434 --> 41:13.657
Okay, Pike. Walk me through what happened.

41:13.657 --> 41:16.573
- I don't know, the kid
was controlling you,

41:16.573 --> 41:18.587
trying to save the day.

41:18.587 --> 41:19.868
- Did it work?

41:19.868 --> 41:21.868
- Are we still employed?

41:23.191 --> 41:27.108
- This is why nobody goes
to your poker nights.

41:37.356 --> 41:38.189
- Hey!

41:39.573 --> 41:43.053
Kaeluss, uh, was just getting
me to look up in the vents.

41:43.053 --> 41:46.934
Make sure none of those
kids are trying to escape.

41:46.934 --> 41:48.835
Some of them were pretty wily

41:48.835 --> 41:50.305
so he wanna,

41:50.305 --> 41:51.305
do I have to stop?

41:51.305 --> 41:53.180
You know, like I should just stop.

41:53.180 --> 41:54.571
You're not buying this.

41:54.571 --> 41:56.002
- You're the principal right?

41:56.002 --> 41:58.002
- Yes, Principal Hughes.

41:59.225 --> 42:00.975
You look like an Andy

42:02.224 --> 42:05.604
Garf-lincoln-blur,

42:05.604 --> 42:07.711
if I get close, you gotta say it.

42:07.711 --> 42:09.482
If I rhyme, same thing.

42:09.482 --> 42:10.448
- I heard this cat runs the school

42:10.448 --> 42:12.644
and his ability is only a level one.

42:12.644 --> 42:13.795
- That's true.

42:13.795 --> 42:15.412
That's, uh, I always say,

42:15.412 --> 42:16.321
it's not about the size of the ability,

42:16.321 --> 42:18.404
it's how you use it. Huh?

42:19.243 --> 42:20.993
Ah, this guy gets it.

42:22.188 --> 42:24.269
- No, I remember now.

42:24.269 --> 42:26.493
This dude locks stuff.

42:28.218 --> 42:32.431
Pathetic, right?

42:32.431 --> 42:35.235
You've messed up my tie?

42:35.235 --> 42:37.182
I also unlock things!

42:37.182 --> 42:38.765
So, you know, both.

42:39.728 --> 42:43.695
Anyway, thank you for
laughing with me, not at me.

42:43.695 --> 42:44.625
That's something I appreciate

42:44.625 --> 42:46.166
and I'll remember you for.

42:46.166 --> 42:47.516
- Woah, woah, woah.

42:47.516 --> 42:48.349
Nice try, Goldilocks.

42:49.402 --> 42:52.380
- Ah, see what you did there.

42:52.380 --> 42:54.130
'Cause I lock things.

42:55.315 --> 42:57.785
Not sure where the gold
part comes from but

42:57.785 --> 43:00.657
guessing brains aren't
your strong suits since

43:00.657 --> 43:03.713
you're just a couple of
lowly guards.

43:16.996 --> 43:19.051
Not so useless after all, is it?

43:19.051 --> 43:20.329
- Let us out of this!

43:20.329 --> 43:22.692
- Sit it off. Don't worry,
it doesn't last forever.

43:22.692 --> 43:23.609
- How long?

43:24.561 --> 43:26.340
- Well, let's put it this way.

43:26.340 --> 43:28.810
Your feet are gonna wear
off before your mouths do.

43:28.810 --> 43:32.799
What?

43:32.799 --> 43:34.218
- Oh, I can't hear you.

43:34.218 --> 43:37.242
Oh yeah, I'm awesome? Thank you!

43:37.242 --> 43:38.075
Bye!

43:50.221 --> 43:53.212
- Don't you ever do that to me again!

43:53.212 --> 43:54.244
- You didn't give me much choice.

43:54.244 --> 43:55.693
- You should've let me fight him.

43:55.693 --> 43:56.526
- He would've killed you.

43:56.526 --> 43:59.192
- So what? You should've let him.

43:59.192 --> 44:00.297
- You don't mean that.

44:00.297 --> 44:01.406
- You know what? Save it, Pres!

44:01.406 --> 44:02.268
I'm not a!

44:06.727 --> 44:09.312
- What was all that letter stuff?

44:09.312 --> 44:10.145
- What?

44:11.270 --> 44:13.583
I don't know, okay?

44:13.583 --> 44:16.297
He was probably trying to confuse us.

44:16.297 --> 44:20.874
- Yeah that's, uh, that's
what I thought too.

44:20.874 --> 44:22.426
- I hate this stupid place!

44:22.426 --> 44:25.936
- Hey, be angry if you
want but keep it down.

44:25.936 --> 44:28.041
Some of us are trying to hide.

44:28.041 --> 44:29.404
- Attention students.

44:30.916 --> 44:33.587
After much thought and deliberation,

44:33.587 --> 44:36.867
I have decided as your new principal

44:36.867 --> 44:39.367
to change today's lesson plan.

44:41.140 --> 44:42.873
I'll now be teaching you that

44:42.873 --> 44:45.123
every action is a reaction.

44:47.708 --> 44:51.125
You see, you have decided to take action.

44:52.512 --> 44:55.929
Now you'll have to deal with my reaction.

45:06.251 --> 45:08.001
Good luck to you all.

45:11.989 --> 45:13.919
- What do you think he means?

45:13.919 --> 45:14.919
- Who cares?

45:18.609 --> 45:20.588
- Okay, what about that one?

45:20.588 --> 45:22.842
Another locked door.

45:22.842 --> 45:24.771
- Wait, why don't you just do your thing?

45:24.771 --> 45:27.148
You know, bulk up and rip the door off?

45:27.148 --> 45:28.046
- That's not how it works.

45:28.046 --> 45:30.085
I need calories to turn into energy

45:30.085 --> 45:32.166
and that fight took everything I had.

45:32.166 --> 45:34.465
So if you got a turkey here or something

45:34.465 --> 45:36.808
I might be able to help.

45:36.808 --> 45:38.501
So how does yours work anyway?

45:38.501 --> 45:40.133
You like make monsters?

45:40.133 --> 45:42.972
- I don't make them, I summon them.

45:42.972 --> 45:43.805
- That's pretty awesome like.

45:43.805 --> 45:45.537
And have to do what you say?

45:45.537 --> 45:47.739
- Yes, if I keep them small enough.

45:47.739 --> 45:50.045
The bigger they are, the less they listen.

45:50.045 --> 45:52.463
- Sort of like teenagers then.

45:52.463 --> 45:53.796
- Yeah, sort of.

45:54.692 --> 45:56.434
You should really keep food on you.

45:56.434 --> 45:58.943
You're kinda cool when
you're the bigger version.

45:58.943 --> 46:00.443
- Isn't this cool?

46:01.711 --> 46:03.878
- You're right, I'm sorry.

46:05.738 --> 46:06.716
- It's alright, I'm used to it.

46:06.716 --> 46:10.101
This is like my fourth
school in three years.

46:10.101 --> 46:13.253
Everywhere I go, I gotta
pretend like I'm two people.

46:13.253 --> 46:14.898
A jock who wins football games

46:14.898 --> 46:16.302
and the invisible kid.

46:16.302 --> 46:17.419
- Which one's harder?

46:17.419 --> 46:21.392
- Well the nerdy looser,
popular sporty guy,

46:21.392 --> 46:22.225
they all got problems.

46:22.225 --> 46:25.286
I mean, I think everyone thinks
either side's got it better.

46:25.286 --> 46:27.625
- Yeah, sometimes I feel
bad when I complain.

46:27.625 --> 46:29.958
I mean I look at people like

46:30.917 --> 46:32.755
nerds or whatever

46:32.755 --> 46:36.235
and I think okay, at
least it's not that bad.

46:36.235 --> 46:37.885
- I think teenage is like Latin

46:37.885 --> 46:39.040
for crappy years or something.

46:40.459 --> 46:41.542
Too bad, man.

46:42.727 --> 46:45.864
I'm really hoping this
school is gonna be different.

46:46.697 --> 46:48.585
Ms. Potter,
give them their abilities.

46:48.585 --> 46:49.945
Yes sir.

46:49.945 --> 46:52.631
- Oh yeah, I've been dreaming about this.

46:52.631 --> 46:54.637
Give me that earthquake ability.

46:54.637 --> 46:55.870
Gonna rip this school in half.

46:58.882 --> 47:00.708
- Uh, Ms. Potter,

47:00.708 --> 47:02.654
nothing over a level four.

47:02.654 --> 47:03.557
Of course, sir.

47:03.557 --> 47:05.411
- Woah woah woah. What's the deal?

47:05.411 --> 47:06.521
You promised us abilities.

47:06.521 --> 47:08.732
- You said we'd be gods.

47:08.732 --> 47:10.918
- And I'm delivering.

47:10.918 --> 47:13.232
I'd be a complete idiot to
give all these abilities

47:13.232 --> 47:15.942
to criminal elements such as yourselves.

47:15.942 --> 47:18.559
So be happy with your level four.

47:18.559 --> 47:20.266
Go find those kids.

47:31.322 --> 47:32.774
- Hey look! Principal Hughes.

47:34.299 --> 47:35.850
- Hey, um,

47:35.850 --> 47:37.357
I didn't get a chance to
say thank you back there

47:37.357 --> 47:39.488
when you pushed me out of the way.

47:39.488 --> 47:40.718
- Don't worry about it.

47:40.718 --> 47:42.992
I'm taking a saving a person
a day challenge for charity,

47:42.992 --> 47:45.958
so you kinda helped me out.

47:45.958 --> 47:47.370
- Come on, let's go check on another--

47:49.543 --> 47:51.207
- Not good.

47:51.207 --> 47:52.693
- Now you see me,

47:52.693 --> 47:55.895
now you don't.

47:55.895 --> 47:58.072
- Liv? I can't see!

47:58.072 --> 47:59.405
He's blinded me!

48:06.797 --> 48:08.611
- It almost feel bad.

48:08.611 --> 48:09.778
It's too easy.

48:15.356 --> 48:17.182
Oh, it's the witch!

48:17.182 --> 48:20.099
- You say it like it's a bad thing.

48:22.583 --> 48:23.416
- Liv!

48:36.635 --> 48:38.118
- I can, I can see!

48:38.118 --> 48:39.302
I can see!

48:40.706 --> 48:43.539
- Don't just leave me here, Alice!

48:48.069 --> 48:50.733
Alice, I can't get out of this.

48:50.733 --> 48:51.566
Wait!

49:10.437 --> 49:13.448
You see anyone?

49:13.448 --> 49:14.281
- No.

49:15.293 --> 49:16.751
I don't think the others are coming.

49:16.751 --> 49:18.101
- What are we supposed to do?

49:18.101 --> 49:22.666
- Go back there and we
finish what we started.

49:22.666 --> 49:24.664
- Hey, what is your deal?

49:24.664 --> 49:26.093
First you want nothing to do with this,

49:26.093 --> 49:27.796
now all you wanna do is go fight?

49:27.796 --> 49:29.296
Make up your mind.

49:30.794 --> 49:33.270
- You are the one who asked me
to fight in the first place.

49:33.270 --> 49:35.243
I was completely happy
to leave you guys too.

49:35.243 --> 49:36.076
- I wish you did!

49:36.076 --> 49:37.613
- If I did, you'd be dead!

49:37.613 --> 49:39.978
Alright, just calm down.

49:39.978 --> 49:40.927
This isn't helping us.

49:40.927 --> 49:42.010
- I don't need this.

49:42.010 --> 49:43.207
- Wait.

49:43.207 --> 49:44.400
We need a plan.

49:44.400 --> 49:45.915
We can't just go storming in there.

49:45.915 --> 49:48.911
- Stay out of my way. That's the plan.

49:48.911 --> 49:51.078
- Don't make me take over.

49:53.023 --> 49:54.405
- Stay out of my head.

49:54.405 --> 49:56.302
- You're gonna get people killed.

49:56.302 --> 49:57.160
So stop thinking about whatever

49:57.160 --> 50:01.508
petty feud you have with
this guy and work with us.

50:01.508 --> 50:02.341
What?

50:02.341 --> 50:03.174
You wrote him some letters

50:03.174 --> 50:04.569
and he wouldn't let you be
president of his fan club?

50:04.569 --> 50:06.150
Andrasta that's enough?

50:06.150 --> 50:07.215
- Or did you think if
you sent in those letters

50:07.215 --> 50:09.119
he'd let you be his new sidekick?

50:09.119 --> 50:10.739
Let you carry his cape around.

50:10.739 --> 50:12.050
- You don't know me.

50:12.050 --> 50:13.803
- We all know you.

50:13.803 --> 50:14.922
You're the big loner tough guy

50:14.922 --> 50:17.381
that beats kids up for
running into him accidentally.

50:17.381 --> 50:19.823
The one who only cares about himself.

50:19.823 --> 50:23.639
So yeah, we know you. We just hate you.

50:32.448 --> 50:34.031
- Andrasta come on!

50:42.532 --> 50:43.647
That was a low blow.

50:43.647 --> 50:44.580
- What? You're on his side?

50:44.580 --> 50:46.618
- I'm on everyone's side!

50:46.618 --> 50:47.951
And in case you haven't noticed,

50:47.951 --> 50:49.911
there's a madman that's
gonna kill everyone we know!

50:49.911 --> 50:52.836
- Well why is he giving me such a problem?

51:08.884 --> 51:10.125
- He saved your life back there!

51:10.125 --> 51:11.682
- Yeah and if he joined
in the fight earlier,

51:11.682 --> 51:13.436
my life wouldn't of needed saving.

51:13.436 --> 51:17.062
We could've saved everyone. He's selfish.

51:55.009 --> 51:56.845
- Like it or not we need him.

51:56.845 --> 51:59.445
He's strong and he can fight.

51:59.445 --> 52:02.497
- I'm not apologizing to him.

52:02.497 --> 52:05.467
- That's fine, just talk to him.

52:05.467 --> 52:07.818
- It won't help, he hates me.

52:17.904 --> 52:19.568
- You alright?

52:19.568 --> 52:23.025
Looks like Pike took your breath away.

52:24.308 --> 52:27.003
- Look, I don't know why he's so upset.

52:27.003 --> 52:29.461
We all got our own battles.

52:29.461 --> 52:30.985
There's a lot of people counting on us

52:30.985 --> 52:34.433
to put this aside and work together.

52:34.433 --> 52:36.121
You understand?

52:50.983 --> 52:52.656
- This one gave me a headache.

52:52.656 --> 52:53.489
Bring the roof down on them,

52:53.489 --> 52:55.559
we don't need to bring them all back.

52:55.559 --> 52:58.192
- It'll be my pleasure.

53:04.421 --> 53:06.016
- Fine.

53:06.016 --> 53:07.433
I'll talk to him.

53:08.741 --> 53:09.741
- Thank you.

53:40.912 --> 53:42.276
- Look,

53:42.276 --> 53:45.528
we have no idea what your
deal is with Kaeluss.

53:45.528 --> 53:46.778
But the fact is

53:48.962 --> 53:50.639
we need you.

53:50.639 --> 53:53.137
So if you can help us save everyone,

53:53.137 --> 53:55.797
we'll help you duke it out with Kaeluss.

53:55.797 --> 53:56.659
Fair?

53:59.486 --> 54:00.833
- Good enough.

54:00.833 --> 54:02.000
- Okay, great.

54:04.022 --> 54:05.799
We need to regroup, find the others.

54:05.799 --> 54:07.366
Let's go.

54:07.366 --> 54:08.511
- Who knows?

54:08.511 --> 54:10.899
You might even like trying to help people.

54:10.899 --> 54:12.220
- Yeah, think I'll try it.

54:21.878 --> 54:23.784
- Oh for once in your
life please be there.

54:24.617 --> 54:26.034
Come on, come on.

54:27.578 --> 54:28.994
Hughes.

54:28.994 --> 54:31.434
I told you to call me the instant

54:31.434 --> 54:33.338
that Kaeluss chose his successor.

54:33.338 --> 54:34.171
I have the media--

54:34.171 --> 54:35.004
- Quiet!

54:36.036 --> 54:37.561
- Excuse me?

54:37.561 --> 54:38.940
- Listen,

54:38.940 --> 54:40.014
I know how this is gonna sound,

54:40.014 --> 54:42.039
but Kaeluss has taken over the school.

54:42.039 --> 54:43.661
Alright? He's not what
he said he was gonna be.

54:43.661 --> 54:45.524
He's taken all the kids' abilities.

54:45.524 --> 54:47.574
You need to send for help right away.

54:47.574 --> 54:49.518
- Is this some kind of a joke?

54:49.518 --> 54:50.351
I tell you Hughes,

54:50.351 --> 54:52.540
I will never understand
your sense of humor.

54:52.540 --> 54:53.739
- Shut it!

54:53.739 --> 54:55.572
Alright? This is not a joke.

54:55.572 --> 54:56.900
So you need off your wrinkly arse

54:56.900 --> 54:59.075
and send whatever military
you can to help us

54:59.075 --> 55:01.009
because we're in real trouble here.

55:01.009 --> 55:02.779
Do you understand me?

55:02.779 --> 55:05.112
- Alright. I'll make a call.

55:07.675 --> 55:08.675
- Thank you.

55:09.543 --> 55:10.376
Please tell them to be quick.

55:10.376 --> 55:11.502
I don't wanna have--

55:11.502 --> 55:12.335
He's here!

55:14.196 --> 55:17.056
- It's alright. I made a rule.

55:17.056 --> 55:18.639
Help is on the way.

55:20.564 --> 55:22.344
- You hear that? It's over.

55:24.900 --> 55:27.235
Nice try but once I lock something,

55:27.235 --> 55:29.818
it stays locked until I say so.

55:30.958 --> 55:33.799
- Or unless I say so.

55:38.181 --> 55:39.431
- What is this?

55:42.839 --> 55:44.172
What's going on?

55:45.860 --> 55:48.732
- I thought you said
you could handle this.

55:48.732 --> 55:51.691
- And I thought you said there
wouldn't be any problems.

55:51.691 --> 55:53.774
I guess we're both liars.

55:57.870 --> 56:00.585
- You're a part of this?

56:00.585 --> 56:03.919
- Kaeluss is the future, Mr. Hughes.

56:03.919 --> 56:06.419
I'm just securing my position.

56:07.983 --> 56:09.233
- But the kids.

56:12.056 --> 56:15.282
- Let you in on a little secret.

56:15.282 --> 56:16.282
I hate kids.

56:59.270 --> 57:00.567
- Little pig?

57:01.925 --> 57:02.979
Little pig?

57:05.450 --> 57:06.676
Let me in.

57:08.066 --> 57:09.145
- I really want to,

57:09.145 --> 57:12.546
but I'm not gonna say chinny chin chin.

57:12.546 --> 57:14.560
- I'll summon a monster for the door.

57:14.560 --> 57:16.666
- No, no. Just rest.

57:16.666 --> 57:18.297
Maybe the others will
find a way to get here

57:18.297 --> 57:20.916
before this psycho lady can get in.

57:20.916 --> 57:22.499
- I hope, and soon.

57:23.618 --> 57:24.451
- Me too.

57:25.900 --> 57:29.894
I guess we're even on the
life saving stuff now.

57:29.894 --> 57:32.096
- Yeah, I guess we are.

57:32.096 --> 57:33.120
- Thanks for that, by the way.

57:33.120 --> 57:35.912
It turns out I'm kinda
like addicted to seeing.

57:35.912 --> 57:38.758
Oh and that monster you summoned?

57:38.758 --> 57:40.222
Phenomenal bite on that guy.

57:40.222 --> 57:42.818
- Um hmm. She's a nasty one.

57:42.818 --> 57:46.439
And she's not letting go anytime soon.

57:46.439 --> 57:48.999
Hey, in case I don't get a chance,

57:48.999 --> 57:53.708
I wanted to say sorry for
being mean to you this morning.

57:53.708 --> 57:56.139
You know, when you asked
me out or whatever.

57:56.139 --> 57:57.892
- That's alright, I'm used to it.

57:57.892 --> 57:59.837
- No, it was rude of me.

57:59.837 --> 58:01.602
- Does this mean you'll
go on a date with me now?

58:01.602 --> 58:04.327
I'm like five
years older than you.

58:04.327 --> 58:05.593
- So what?

58:05.593 --> 58:07.709
When you're 30, I'll be 25.

58:07.709 --> 58:10.323
- Maybe when I'm 60 and you're 55.

58:10.323 --> 58:14.145
- Oh, I'll trade you in long before that.

58:14.145 --> 58:15.509
- I'll tell you what.

58:15.509 --> 58:17.334
If we make it out of here,

58:17.334 --> 58:20.279
I'll introduce you to some
of my younger friends. Deal?

58:20.279 --> 58:23.126
- Okay, but you gotta tell them up front.

58:23.126 --> 58:24.934
I don't kiss on the first date.

58:24.934 --> 58:26.204
I'm a classy dame.

58:26.204 --> 58:30.402
Oww. Stop making me laugh.

58:30.402 --> 58:33.818
- Sorry, it's kinda
all I got going for me.

58:33.818 --> 58:34.985
- No it's not.

58:38.960 --> 58:40.512
- Shake.

58:40.512 --> 58:41.966
Shake!

58:41.966 --> 58:44.216
And I'll rip this door off!

58:45.259 --> 58:47.283
- What is that?

58:47.283 --> 58:49.354
Lady you're so lucky I don't have like a,

58:49.354 --> 58:51.844
like a ham sandwich or
something right now.

58:51.844 --> 58:52.677
Alright.

58:57.745 --> 58:59.328
What is it?

59:01.192 --> 59:02.025
- Food!

59:07.754 --> 59:09.181
- They could be anywhere.

59:09.181 --> 59:10.983
How do we even know where to look?

59:13.493 --> 59:16.243
- They're probably down that way.

59:17.951 --> 59:19.618
- Had a bite to eat.

59:23.589 --> 59:24.806
- Thanks.

59:24.806 --> 59:26.019
- Hey just don't forget
to tell your friends

59:26.019 --> 59:27.352
how heroic I am.

59:29.498 --> 59:32.242
- Principal Hughes probably
unlocked the door by now.

59:32.242 --> 59:34.510
Maybe we can find a back
way to sneak everybody out.

59:34.510 --> 59:36.073
- He's probably still in his office.

59:36.073 --> 59:36.990
- Let's go.

59:38.858 --> 59:40.070
Guess you'd
never think you'd be hanging

59:40.070 --> 59:42.356
in a principal office
if you wanted to, huh?

59:42.356 --> 59:43.300
Shut up.

59:43.300 --> 59:45.918
Come on,
are we not friends yet?

59:45.918 --> 59:48.296
Come on, I'll be the sidekick.

59:48.296 --> 59:51.219
I can even kick people in the sides.

59:51.219 --> 59:53.636
Changing my name to Kickside.

59:58.462 --> 01:00:00.295
- Woah! What happened?

01:00:01.882 --> 01:00:03.299
- Where's Hughes?

01:00:06.456 --> 01:00:07.956
- It's over, kids.

01:00:09.915 --> 01:00:11.236
- Mr. Kent, I'm so glad you're here.

01:00:11.236 --> 01:00:14.055
Look, something terrible
has happened at the school.

01:00:14.055 --> 01:00:15.541
Hey man.
What do you got there?

01:00:15.541 --> 01:00:17.093
- Mind your business.

01:00:17.093 --> 01:00:18.698
- Sir, if you can send in the cavalry,

01:00:18.698 --> 01:00:20.180
we can save the others.

01:00:20.180 --> 01:00:22.842
We just need some backup.

01:00:22.842 --> 01:00:24.759
- You kids surprise me.

01:00:25.906 --> 01:00:27.269
- Thank you, sir.

01:00:27.269 --> 01:00:29.513
- It wasn't a complement.

01:00:33.844 --> 01:00:35.626
- When I was in charge,

01:00:35.626 --> 01:00:39.298
my students knew the meaning of greatness.

01:00:39.298 --> 01:00:43.465
They understood that they had
to do what they were told.

01:00:44.567 --> 01:00:46.241
- What did you do?

01:00:46.241 --> 01:00:48.939
- What you should all have been doing.

01:00:48.939 --> 01:00:51.670
I follow the chain of command.

01:00:51.670 --> 01:00:56.325
You kids are too stupid to
know when you have it good.

01:00:56.325 --> 01:00:58.528
You're like that moron Hughes.

01:00:58.528 --> 01:01:00.728
- Hey! Principal Hughes isn't a moron.

01:01:00.728 --> 01:01:03.519
- He's 10 times the principal you are.

01:01:03.519 --> 01:01:07.845
- You think five kids
can make a difference?

01:01:07.845 --> 01:01:09.611
- Hey man, you alright?

01:01:09.611 --> 01:01:13.444
You are the
bottom of the barrel.

01:01:14.311 --> 01:01:15.228
- I'm done.

01:01:20.886 --> 01:01:21.719
- Hey, uh, guys?

01:01:21.719 --> 01:01:24.973
I think tough loner guy
is having a moment here.

01:01:24.973 --> 01:01:26.266
- What?

01:01:26.266 --> 01:01:27.933
For crying out loud.

01:01:29.912 --> 01:01:30.745
- When we get out of this,

01:01:30.745 --> 01:01:32.570
I'm gonna personally make sure you pay.

01:01:32.570 --> 01:01:34.380
- You do that son.

01:01:34.380 --> 01:01:36.630
I'll be waiting right here.

01:01:44.948 --> 01:01:46.629
- Hey! Come on!

01:01:46.629 --> 01:01:47.637
I thought we had a deal!

01:01:47.637 --> 01:01:48.922
- Deal's off.

01:01:48.922 --> 01:01:50.718
- We don't have time for this drama!

01:01:50.718 --> 01:01:51.798
- What's changed?

01:01:51.798 --> 01:01:53.244
- He was reading some file he stole.

01:01:54.889 --> 01:01:57.015
Sorry bro. Not judging.

01:01:57.015 --> 01:01:58.677
Just trying to speed things up.

01:01:58.677 --> 01:02:00.377
- Look if you wanna stay and get killed,

01:02:00.377 --> 01:02:01.794
that's up to you.

01:02:03.143 --> 01:02:04.560
But count me out.

01:02:05.600 --> 01:02:08.333
- What was in the file.

01:02:08.333 --> 01:02:10.333
- None of your business.

01:02:11.209 --> 01:02:12.692
- Fine, we'll find out my way.

01:02:18.326 --> 01:02:20.621
- Good morning students.

01:02:20.621 --> 01:02:21.642
Hope everybody's having a good day.

01:02:21.642 --> 01:02:24.826
I see I've interrupted science class.

01:02:24.826 --> 01:02:27.957
I like to introduce you to a
new student who's joining us.

01:02:27.957 --> 01:02:30.073
This is Andrasta.

01:02:30.073 --> 01:02:31.309
Andrasta would you like to tell everybody

01:02:31.309 --> 01:02:33.642
a little bit about yourself?

01:02:36.054 --> 01:02:38.054
Maybe where you're from?

01:02:41.279 --> 01:02:42.796
Okay.

01:02:42.796 --> 01:02:44.107
Well she's, uh, just ready to learn.

01:02:44.107 --> 01:02:47.274
There's a seat right up there for you.

01:02:56.402 --> 01:02:58.846
Our abilities
are not for sale!

01:02:58.846 --> 01:03:02.125
Our abilities are not for sale!

01:03:02.125 --> 01:03:04.936
We will not be controlled!

01:03:04.936 --> 01:03:07.499
I mean, metaphorically.

01:03:07.499 --> 01:03:09.767
- Tuck in that shirt, Mr. Francis.

01:03:09.767 --> 01:03:10.921
Morning girls.

01:03:10.921 --> 01:03:15.088
Another one for me then.

01:03:20.912 --> 01:03:22.294
Alright.

01:03:24.182 --> 01:03:26.425
Our abilities
are not for sale!

01:03:26.425 --> 01:03:28.014
Our abilities are not for sale!

01:03:28.014 --> 01:03:31.158
Andrasta, a minute please.

01:03:31.158 --> 01:03:34.142
Our abilities
are not for sale!

01:03:44.959 --> 01:03:46.876
- What was in the file?

01:03:48.917 --> 01:03:50.494
- I don't know.

01:03:50.494 --> 01:03:52.327
I didn't see anything.

01:03:53.723 --> 01:03:55.263
- Hey, is that Whitey?

01:04:00.426 --> 01:04:01.759
Are you alright?

01:04:02.930 --> 01:04:04.834
- How did you escape?

01:04:04.834 --> 01:04:08.251
- Well I give credit where credit is due.

01:04:09.786 --> 01:04:11.036
- It's Kaeluss.

01:04:11.881 --> 01:04:13.631
He's using telepathy.

01:04:15.458 --> 01:04:19.051
- You managed to defeat my best people.

01:04:19.051 --> 01:04:21.805
Here's a thought. Join me.

01:04:21.805 --> 01:04:23.803
Be part of my team.

01:04:23.803 --> 01:04:26.179
You're obviously better
than the people I chose.

01:04:26.179 --> 01:04:29.242
- Oh no, no. This is freaking me out.

01:04:29.242 --> 01:04:30.638
Like those commercials
with the babies' heads

01:04:30.638 --> 01:04:32.555
on the grown up bodies.

01:04:33.972 --> 01:04:35.214
- No.

01:04:35.214 --> 01:04:37.369
Well, given our current situation,

01:04:37.369 --> 01:04:39.002
I can't say I blame you.

01:04:39.002 --> 01:04:41.418
So let's go with another plan.

01:04:41.418 --> 01:04:44.269
Meet me in the auditorium in five minutes

01:04:44.269 --> 01:04:46.321
or I'll destroy the entire school

01:04:46.321 --> 01:04:48.504
and everyone in it,

01:04:48.504 --> 01:04:49.518
starting with this guy.

01:04:53.295 --> 01:04:54.876
Oh, you can't see me.

01:04:54.876 --> 01:04:56.469
I'm holding up Principal Hughes.

01:04:57.924 --> 01:04:59.007
Five minutes.

01:05:05.411 --> 01:05:06.744
- What do we do?

01:05:07.774 --> 01:05:09.814
- We stick to the plan.

01:05:09.814 --> 01:05:11.949
- I think if we work together
we can stop this guy.

01:05:11.949 --> 01:05:15.199
I mean he's powerful, but he's one guy.

01:05:16.593 --> 01:05:18.886
- What do you think we should do?

01:05:18.886 --> 01:05:20.697
- Whatever you want.

01:05:20.697 --> 01:05:23.536
- Are you seriously leaving?

01:05:23.536 --> 01:05:26.196
- I am not the guy that you need me to be!

01:05:29.410 --> 01:05:30.243
Okay?

01:05:33.432 --> 01:05:35.089
Trust me on this, I am not the hero!

01:05:35.089 --> 01:05:36.589
It's not who I am!

01:05:53.626 --> 01:05:54.709
Come with me.

01:06:10.450 --> 01:06:14.617
I really
hoped I was wrong about him.

01:06:15.554 --> 01:06:18.254
- Can't do it with just four of us.

01:06:18.254 --> 01:06:21.775
- I can barely stand, let
alone summon anything.

01:06:21.775 --> 01:06:23.935
- Well that's it.

01:06:23.935 --> 01:06:25.268
We just give up?

01:06:27.514 --> 01:06:32.482
- It's the only way to make
sure no one else gets hurt.

01:06:32.482 --> 01:06:34.732
We all wanted to be heroes.

01:06:35.653 --> 01:06:36.736
We still can.

01:06:38.083 --> 01:06:42.250
It's just gonna cost us a
little more than we thought.

01:07:15.226 --> 01:07:16.994
- Are they always this late?

01:07:16.994 --> 01:07:19.244
I said five minutes, right?

01:07:20.674 --> 01:07:21.617
- You coward.

01:07:22.807 --> 01:07:25.839
- Sticks and stones, Principal Hughes.

01:07:25.839 --> 01:07:27.839
- Why would you do this?

01:07:29.649 --> 01:07:31.537
- Well I'm sure in my autobiography

01:07:31.537 --> 01:07:35.339
it'll say something about,
you know, basic instinct.

01:07:35.339 --> 01:07:37.081
Take some time, you know,

01:07:37.081 --> 01:07:38.792
get poetic about self preservation.

01:07:38.792 --> 01:07:42.291
But the truth is probably
more likely arrogance.

01:07:42.291 --> 01:07:45.946
What can I say? I like to be on top.

01:07:45.946 --> 01:07:47.671
- You had everything.

01:07:47.671 --> 01:07:48.838
- Yeah, I did.

01:07:50.152 --> 01:07:53.125
And that's the thing
about having everything,

01:07:53.125 --> 01:07:54.875
you always want more.

01:07:58.293 --> 01:08:00.683
Okay, I didn't wanna have to do this,

01:08:00.683 --> 01:08:04.168
but your classmates aren't
giving me much of a choice.

01:08:04.168 --> 01:08:05.149
So let's get this over with.

01:08:08.214 --> 01:08:09.631
Stop.

01:08:11.596 --> 01:08:15.606
- Oh, you got a lot of
guts showing up here.

01:08:15.606 --> 01:08:19.048
Not a lot of brains, mind
you, but a lot of guts.

01:08:19.048 --> 01:08:20.697
- Let them go.

01:08:20.697 --> 01:08:21.613
- What? No!

01:08:22.515 --> 01:08:24.624
Never said anything about that.

01:08:24.624 --> 01:08:26.770
- Let them go and we'll
give you our abilities.

01:08:26.770 --> 01:08:29.013
No more fighting, those are our terms.

01:08:29.013 --> 01:08:32.599
Those are the terms.

01:08:32.599 --> 01:08:34.060
You know, if I didn't
hate you kids so much,

01:08:34.060 --> 01:08:35.893
I'd probably like you.

01:08:37.515 --> 01:08:40.799
But wait, two, three, four, where's Klon?

01:08:40.799 --> 01:08:42.174
- He left.

01:08:42.174 --> 01:08:43.131
- Of course he did.

01:08:43.131 --> 01:08:45.049
Wouldn't be a surprise.

01:08:46.318 --> 01:08:47.151
Alright.

01:08:48.478 --> 01:08:50.627
You give me your abilities,
I'll let them go.

01:08:50.627 --> 01:08:51.461
- Don't do it!

01:08:51.461 --> 01:08:52.301
- Shut up!

01:08:52.301 --> 01:08:53.932
We're making deals over here!

01:08:55.103 --> 01:08:56.100
Stop it!

01:08:56.100 --> 01:08:58.020
- Swear you'll let them go.

01:08:58.020 --> 01:09:01.703
- Yeah, I promise! I don't have all day!

01:09:01.703 --> 01:09:02.872
We're doing this or what?

01:09:07.791 --> 01:09:08.624
- Alright.

01:09:09.747 --> 01:09:10.705
- We'll do it.

01:09:10.705 --> 01:09:12.067
- Oh no.

01:09:12.067 --> 01:09:12.899
- Super!

01:09:14.147 --> 01:09:15.875
Come on down.

01:09:15.875 --> 01:09:20.042
Put your hand in the machine,
let's make this official.

01:09:40.987 --> 01:09:43.554
- Alright, we did it.

01:09:43.554 --> 01:09:45.066
Now let everyone go.

01:09:48.939 --> 01:09:51.273
- That was your only chance!

01:09:52.859 --> 01:09:54.193
And you blew it!

01:09:56.334 --> 01:09:58.904
I mean when you guys first came in,

01:09:58.904 --> 01:10:00.253
I was a little bit nervous, you know.

01:10:00.253 --> 01:10:01.731
I thought if they really band together,

01:10:01.731 --> 01:10:03.015
I should be a little bit worried.

01:10:03.015 --> 01:10:05.792
But you just blew it!

01:10:05.792 --> 01:10:07.505
- We had a deal.

01:10:07.505 --> 01:10:10.274
We had a deal?

01:10:10.274 --> 01:10:13.985
Never underestimate the
stupidity of teenagers

01:10:13.985 --> 01:10:15.985
right, Principal Hughes?

01:10:17.956 --> 01:10:19.792
You were the one with the sandwich, right?

01:10:19.792 --> 01:10:20.650
The one that hit me?

01:10:20.650 --> 01:10:21.483
- Yeah?

01:10:24.971 --> 01:10:25.969
- Are you alright?

01:10:25.969 --> 01:10:27.307
- I think so.

01:10:27.307 --> 01:10:29.359
- Who else hit me?

01:10:31.225 --> 01:10:32.140
- I did.

01:10:38.785 --> 01:10:40.498
- There he is.

01:10:40.498 --> 01:10:42.240
- Let them go.

01:10:42.240 --> 01:10:44.032
- Then what? What do I get?

01:10:44.032 --> 01:10:46.289
Are you gonna surrender?

01:10:46.289 --> 01:10:50.231
- No, but I promise to let you
walk outta here in one piece.

01:10:50.231 --> 01:10:53.757
- That's no way to talk to family.

01:10:53.757 --> 01:10:54.590
- What?

01:10:55.884 --> 01:10:57.120
You didn't tell them?

01:10:57.120 --> 01:10:57.953
- Shut up.

01:10:59.401 --> 01:11:00.234
- You see,

01:11:00.234 --> 01:11:04.029
the reason Klon here is so
wishy washy on helping you

01:11:04.029 --> 01:11:06.144
is because he is me.

01:11:06.144 --> 01:11:07.616
- I said shut up.

01:11:07.616 --> 01:11:10.807
- Let me guess, you found the files?

01:11:10.807 --> 01:11:11.640
You found the truth?

01:11:11.640 --> 01:11:15.807
Probably not the truth
that Hughes fed you though.

01:11:16.997 --> 01:11:18.580
- You're worthless.

01:11:20.643 --> 01:11:24.310
I'm sorry, I was just
trying to protect you.

01:11:25.879 --> 01:11:29.172
- You used to send me all kinds of letters

01:11:29.172 --> 01:11:30.984
'cause Hughes gave him some story

01:11:30.984 --> 01:11:34.484
that I was his long lost dad or something.

01:11:35.921 --> 01:11:38.299
And it would say "I just
want someone I can talk to,

01:11:38.299 --> 01:11:40.891
"someone who understands me."

01:11:40.891 --> 01:11:45.058
I used to
laugh when I got those letters.

01:11:45.982 --> 01:11:48.412
You want the truth, kid?

01:11:48.412 --> 01:11:49.995
I'm not your daddy.

01:11:51.060 --> 01:11:53.363
You're just some half cocked experiment

01:11:53.363 --> 01:11:55.916
that Mr. Kent came up with,

01:11:55.916 --> 01:11:57.401
trying to make a clone out of me.

01:11:58.491 --> 01:12:00.741
In case I got sick or hurt.

01:12:02.084 --> 01:12:02.957
But Hughes here is the one that

01:12:02.957 --> 01:12:05.624
sprung you out of the test tube.

01:12:07.086 --> 01:12:08.419
How'd that feel?

01:12:10.610 --> 01:12:12.783
I wanna know, I wanna know.

01:12:12.783 --> 01:12:14.365
How did that feel

01:12:14.365 --> 01:12:19.017
to find out that you were
only made from my spare parts?

01:12:32.885 --> 01:12:34.135
- Get him Klon!

01:12:39.565 --> 01:12:42.496
- Gotta watch out for those!

01:12:42.496 --> 01:12:43.488
You're really this stubborn?

01:13:13.994 --> 01:13:14.827
- Get him!

01:13:25.628 --> 01:13:26.461
- Enough!

01:13:30.349 --> 01:13:31.628
Had enough yet?

01:13:31.628 --> 01:13:32.733
- Never.

01:13:32.733 --> 01:13:33.778
- Come on! Is this what you wanted?

01:13:33.778 --> 01:13:35.550
A little family bonding?

01:13:35.550 --> 01:13:39.717
Stop it!

01:13:51.154 --> 01:13:52.558
- There you go!

01:13:52.558 --> 01:13:54.991
Now you're just a regular kid!

01:13:54.991 --> 01:13:56.124
You don't have to worry about growing up

01:13:56.124 --> 01:13:57.607
and turning out like me!

01:13:57.607 --> 01:13:59.646
- I would never be like you.

01:13:59.646 --> 01:14:00.896
- You're right.

01:14:08.895 --> 01:14:10.228
Something funny?

01:14:11.757 --> 01:14:13.174
- It's nighttime.

01:14:25.212 --> 01:14:27.212
- I took your abilities.

01:14:28.179 --> 01:14:30.260
- Werewolf isn't an ability,

01:14:30.260 --> 01:14:31.369
it's a curse.

01:14:32.901 --> 01:14:34.568
I know about curses.

01:14:39.380 --> 01:14:40.506
- And I fought things twice your size.

01:14:55.332 --> 01:14:57.195
- That's enough.

01:14:57.195 --> 01:14:58.028
That's enough!

01:15:03.593 --> 01:15:04.426
- Ow.

01:15:07.807 --> 01:15:09.030
- You're better than him.

01:15:09.030 --> 01:15:13.113
I would've
let her finish him off.

01:15:14.529 --> 01:15:16.538
- It's a cute trick,

01:15:16.538 --> 01:15:17.371
real cute.

01:15:18.485 --> 01:15:20.483
Shouldn't be surprised.

01:15:20.483 --> 01:15:22.816
Technically I thought of it.

01:15:23.723 --> 01:15:26.223
But it's time for this to end.

01:15:34.231 --> 01:15:37.596
What is this?

01:15:37.596 --> 01:15:39.708
I've already taken all your abilities.

01:15:39.708 --> 01:15:40.613
- You didn't take his.

01:15:40.613 --> 01:15:41.946
- What?
- Do it!

01:15:43.830 --> 01:15:45.094
- No! No!

01:15:57.912 --> 01:15:59.245
- Someone, food!

01:16:00.737 --> 01:16:03.132
Please say you still feel like fighting.

01:16:16.752 --> 01:16:18.322
- Hey,

01:16:18.322 --> 01:16:20.630
thanks for coming back.

01:16:20.630 --> 01:16:21.463
- Look,

01:16:21.463 --> 01:16:24.057
I don't know what you saw when you were

01:16:24.057 --> 01:16:25.403
poking around in my head,

01:16:25.403 --> 01:16:27.091
but I'm not like--

01:16:29.230 --> 01:16:31.647
- Hey Klon, maybe we should--

01:16:34.915 --> 01:16:36.082
Good for them.

01:16:50.457 --> 01:16:51.707
- Where's Deja?

01:17:01.958 --> 01:17:04.156
- Kaeluss? What's going on?

01:17:04.156 --> 01:17:05.292
You owe me!

01:17:05.292 --> 01:17:08.042
You better not have forgotten me.

01:17:10.161 --> 01:17:12.744
- Oh I didn't forget about you.

01:17:15.751 --> 01:17:19.584
- Oh, so you saved the
day after all, huh kid?

01:17:20.802 --> 01:17:21.635
- We did.

01:17:23.459 --> 01:17:27.145
- Too bad you're all the way over there.

01:17:27.145 --> 01:17:28.395
- It's too bad.

01:17:41.760 --> 01:17:43.337
- I wouldn't say I have a type per say,

01:17:43.337 --> 01:17:46.429
but if you have any friends
who are like skinny kids,

01:17:46.429 --> 01:17:47.846
- Hey Metabolism!

01:17:49.545 --> 01:17:52.476
- I don't think you're gonna need my help.

01:17:52.476 --> 01:17:53.309
Hey.

01:17:54.670 --> 01:17:56.844
So what's your deal?
You're a tough loner today?

01:17:56.844 --> 01:18:00.272
- Or you gonna be the guy
who hangs out with us losers?

01:18:00.272 --> 01:18:02.240
- Can't I be both?

01:18:02.240 --> 01:18:04.332
- Well come on, we're gonna
go see a controversial film.

01:18:04.332 --> 01:18:07.555
One Andrasta can make out and
she can protest the theater.

01:18:07.555 --> 01:18:09.150
Win win!

01:18:09.150 --> 01:18:11.594
What? I'm trying to help.

01:18:11.594 --> 01:18:13.094
- Yeah, come with.

01:18:14.090 --> 01:18:16.741
- Can't. I have detention.

01:18:36.048 --> 01:18:37.398
- Afternoon Klon.

01:18:37.398 --> 01:18:39.815
- Afternoon Principal Hughes.

01:18:41.434 --> 01:18:45.601
- I was thinking we would use
this time to write an essay.

01:18:47.021 --> 01:18:48.886
Maybe you could tell me who you are

01:18:48.886 --> 01:18:51.053
or what makes you special.

01:18:52.448 --> 01:18:55.650
Help you out here with
a little mood board.

01:18:55.650 --> 01:18:58.357
Please forgive the crude artwork.

01:18:58.357 --> 01:18:59.357
This is you.

01:19:00.209 --> 01:19:02.626
What makes a hero? Is it art?

01:19:06.633 --> 01:19:08.050
- Psst.
- Brains?

01:19:10.928 --> 01:19:11.761
Abilities?

01:19:17.843 --> 01:19:19.720
This, of course, is just a suggestion.

01:19:19.720 --> 01:19:23.162
I'm also happy to help you
out with any of your studies.

01:19:23.162 --> 01:19:25.412
You know, my math is solid.

01:19:26.658 --> 01:19:30.825
I'm not great at history
but if you, and you're gone.

01:19:31.702 --> 01:19:35.869
Okay, well! Guess I get to
go see that movie after all!

01:20:09.655 --> 01:20:10.488
Are you sure I'll be safe?

01:20:10.488 --> 01:20:13.147
- Oh yeah, doc. Nothing to worry about.

01:20:13.147 --> 01:20:14.762
We got this high tech nap thing.

01:20:14.762 --> 01:20:16.812
It makes it so he can't use his abilities.

01:20:16.812 --> 01:20:19.690
He's as weak as a kitten.

01:20:19.690 --> 01:20:21.702
We just basically need you to go in

01:20:21.702 --> 01:20:23.632
and do an once-over on him.

01:20:23.632 --> 01:20:26.170
And then we can lock him up.

01:20:26.170 --> 01:20:30.360
Apparently he
got attacked by a werewolf.

01:20:30.360 --> 01:20:32.008
A werewolf!

01:20:32.008 --> 01:20:33.892
You know what really sucks?

01:20:33.892 --> 01:20:36.890
I got this guy's autograph a
few years back at a convention.

01:20:36.890 --> 01:20:39.039
I waited in line for like four hours!

01:20:39.039 --> 01:20:41.184
Cost me a month's salary too.

01:20:41.184 --> 01:20:42.773
Now he's gonna rot in some cell,

01:20:42.773 --> 01:20:45.023
thing's gonna be worthless!

01:20:46.977 --> 01:20:48.662
You think it'll worth anything?

01:20:48.662 --> 01:20:50.493
You know, the autograph I mean.

01:20:54.292 --> 01:20:56.663
- Oh, I think it will.
