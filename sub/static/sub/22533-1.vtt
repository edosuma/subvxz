Cho Eun-ji

01:05.251 --> 01:06.542
What is it?

01:07.167 --> 01:08.667
Who the fuck?

01:11.792 --> 01:12.876
What the?!

01:35.542 --> 01:36.584
Who is it?

04:28.167 --> 04:29.334
Eh?

04:30.417 --> 04:31.917
You came alone?

04:32.667 --> 04:34.334
Crazy bitch!

05:01.417 --> 05:02.792
You bitch!

07:07.917 --> 07:10.209
Hands up!
We'll shoot!

07:33.626 --> 07:35.834
Stop! Stay there!

08:16.584 --> 08:21.459
"THE VILLAINESS"

08:27.542 --> 08:31.167
Park and his organization,
whom we've been tracking,

08:31.501 --> 08:33.292
were all eliminated
by this woman.

08:34.501 --> 08:35.501
Look!

08:35.876 --> 08:37.333
Who's he?

08:37.583 --> 08:39.667
We're still IDing him,

08:40.292 --> 08:43.792
but fortunately, he was
only after the meth.

08:44.292 --> 08:45.334
Meth?

08:46.459 --> 08:49.751
Which means he took them
without knowing anything.

08:49.917 --> 08:53.917
So what's the relation
between the girl and him?

08:54.209 --> 08:56.501
We're currently investigating.

08:58.959 --> 09:01.292
Secure the hard drive
no matter what!

09:01.501 --> 09:04.459
If that leaks,
it'll be a bloodbath!

09:06.251 --> 09:08.876
And that girl...

09:09.209 --> 09:11.209
She could be an asset.

09:13.084 --> 09:14.626
No?

11:35.501 --> 11:37.584
Sook-hee, wake up!

11:37.792 --> 11:40.209
Sook-hee! Come back!

12:17.709 --> 12:18.876
Hey, stop!

12:46.292 --> 12:48.542
Hey, rookie!
Stop there!

13:03.917 --> 13:05.834
Is that the new recruit?

13:06.584 --> 13:07.876
Her spirit is something.

13:07.959 --> 13:09.917
You were just like her too.

13:12.459 --> 13:15.459
- Untamable.
- Hey! Go easy, okay?

13:15.667 --> 13:17.417
You'll get out in time!

13:17.626 --> 13:19.917
It's getting interesting,
don't try to stop her.

13:22.126 --> 13:23.417
Take it easy!

13:23.792 --> 13:25.334
You can't get out anyway!

13:25.501 --> 13:26.959
Do something!

13:33.792 --> 13:34.917
Open the door!

13:40.209 --> 13:41.542
To be!

13:42.417 --> 13:43.876
Or not to be!

13:46.209 --> 13:49.459
That bitch is also questionable.

14:04.334 --> 14:06.626
Where's the exit?!

14:13.667 --> 14:16.334
I know, take me with you!

14:23.126 --> 14:24.959
This way, go through here!

14:40.667 --> 14:43.251
What is this place?
Answer me!

14:45.084 --> 14:47.751
There's no time for that,
you have to jump!

14:50.417 --> 14:51.209
What?

14:51.417 --> 14:53.417
Or you can die here.

15:07.917 --> 15:09.626
There she is! Stop!

15:24.126 --> 15:25.126
Sir.

15:25.917 --> 15:29.209
Chief's charisma is
something else today.

15:29.876 --> 15:31.167
Was she fished
out of the prison?

15:31.292 --> 15:33.417
She took out an entire
gang by herself.

15:33.667 --> 15:36.334
The one who'll get
one of us assigned to her?

15:36.917 --> 15:40.751
Even if good in the sack
and comes with a promotion,

15:40.959 --> 15:41.959
I can't live with her.

15:42.209 --> 15:43.584
Comes with a promotion?

15:43.709 --> 15:45.792
Damn, look at you.

15:46.292 --> 15:48.751
Gonna get a promotion
and be our boss?

15:48.917 --> 15:50.209
You're up to it?

15:50.334 --> 15:53.126
Well, I'm good enough
to take you two on.

15:53.334 --> 15:55.001
Listen to this prick.

15:55.917 --> 15:58.792
Have a relationship and
get a promotion, it's win-win.

15:59.334 --> 16:01.584
They don't hand out
those assignments freely.

16:01.709 --> 16:04.834
There've been many
who died trying.

16:05.334 --> 16:06.709
She's coming to.

16:08.792 --> 16:10.251
She's cute.

16:10.917 --> 16:12.417
She actually is.

16:13.042 --> 16:14.876
The plastic surgery went well.

16:15.042 --> 16:17.334
Maybe it was nice to begin with.

16:26.167 --> 16:30.084
Unidentified Korean-Chinese
Assassin Commits Suicide.

16:39.959 --> 16:42.126
As of now, you do not exist.

16:42.709 --> 16:45.084
But we can resurrect you,

16:45.417 --> 16:47.417
if you choose to
join our family.

16:48.459 --> 16:52.542
I don't want to live,
you shoulda killed me.

16:56.792 --> 16:58.209
Kill me!

17:00.417 --> 17:01.667
Kill you?

17:02.292 --> 17:04.126
You can't die.

17:07.001 --> 17:08.791
You got a new family.

17:10.126 --> 17:13.291
Do you think your baby
wants to die too?

17:16.334 --> 17:17.584
Live.

17:17.834 --> 17:19.584
Only if it's for your baby.

17:35.001 --> 17:36.792
What do you want from me?

17:38.001 --> 17:39.667
To live a normal life.

17:41.667 --> 17:42.709
A normal life?

17:43.834 --> 17:45.292
Give us 10 years,

17:45.834 --> 17:48.709
then you'll earn
pension and freedom

17:49.042 --> 17:50.876
for the rest of your life.

17:52.709 --> 17:57.542
First, take a personality test
and figure out a vocation.

17:58.084 --> 18:01.084
You'll become a sleeper cell
and carry out missions.

18:03.334 --> 18:04.667
Once more...

18:16.084 --> 18:18.459
Wow, it looks nice!

18:18.667 --> 18:19.709
Can I try?

18:29.501 --> 18:31.001
Is it weird?

18:36.584 --> 18:38.209
What exactly are you good at?

18:38.334 --> 18:40.709
Do you plan on
rotting here for good?

18:42.084 --> 18:43.542
Shit!

18:44.834 --> 18:46.334
Where's the exit?!

18:46.667 --> 18:49.626
Tell me, before I kill
every one of you!

18:49.917 --> 18:51.001
Go!

18:52.334 --> 18:55.042
Miss! Can you take me?

18:55.501 --> 18:57.042
I know where the exit is!

18:57.167 --> 18:58.417
Lead me!

18:58.584 --> 18:59.834
Follow me!

19:03.501 --> 19:06.584
Why is she using a lame dialect?

19:07.084 --> 19:08.667
She's useless.

19:12.292 --> 19:13.459
And you too.

19:14.126 --> 19:18.876
With that pretty face,
how about acting?

19:19.542 --> 19:21.667
You killed an innocent man,

19:22.001 --> 19:24.667
and even children,
who barely lived!

19:25.167 --> 19:27.042
The scariest thing
in the world is,

19:27.251 --> 19:30.334
watching a corpse that
your hands killed.

19:30.917 --> 19:31.917
This hand!

19:33.084 --> 19:35.667
The stains that
will not wash off!

19:36.792 --> 19:40.001
Even after removing
the flesh, they remain!

19:41.917 --> 19:43.209
Go away!

19:44.459 --> 19:45.917
Scent of blood...

19:46.292 --> 19:47.292
Yes,

19:48.417 --> 19:52.334
dip this hand and wash it.

19:53.917 --> 19:58.417
Flowing water can filter
anything in the world.

20:00.917 --> 20:04.167
River, will you wash my hands,

20:05.334 --> 20:07.751
and cleanse my body?

20:26.917 --> 20:28.292
Eun-hye,

20:29.542 --> 20:31.292
I'll protect you.

20:50.001 --> 20:51.667
It's okay.

20:52.292 --> 20:53.626
Peekaboo!

20:58.417 --> 20:59.459
Here.

20:59.751 --> 21:00.917
Peekaboo!

21:15.792 --> 21:17.084
Nice!

21:17.584 --> 21:18.917
Good job.

21:26.292 --> 21:26.959
Stop!

21:27.126 --> 21:28.792
Stop it, you'll kill her!

21:28.917 --> 21:29.834
Kim-sun!

21:29.917 --> 21:32.126
- Fine! Alright!
- Come on!

21:32.667 --> 21:34.917
You've seen blood,
that's enough.

21:35.042 --> 21:36.792
You'll kill her.

21:37.167 --> 21:38.417
Yo, Yanbian.

21:38.542 --> 21:39.917
I heard you're good
with a sword.

21:40.209 --> 21:43.292
With the baby born, let's spar.

21:47.917 --> 21:49.251
Why you little!

22:01.209 --> 22:02.542
What the hell?

22:08.042 --> 22:09.292
I'm so scared.

22:09.834 --> 22:12.917
Maybe she really wants a go.

22:13.876 --> 22:16.834
Kim-sun!
Fuck her up too!

22:48.459 --> 22:50.751
Sook-hee's no joke.

22:50.917 --> 22:52.792
Can you handle her?

22:52.959 --> 22:55.834
Hyun-soo's the only
viable option for her.

22:56.584 --> 22:58.334
- Shut it.
- Sorry.

22:59.001 --> 23:02.834
Happy birthday!

23:03.334 --> 23:06.792
Happy birthday!

23:07.126 --> 23:10.584
Happy birthday,
dear Eun-hye!

23:10.917 --> 23:13.334
Happy birthday!

23:22.751 --> 23:23.917
Thank you.

23:25.001 --> 23:28.334
You can't let your baby
live a life like yours.

23:36.167 --> 23:37.751
This tattoo...

23:38.834 --> 23:41.917
you won't believe
how much I wanted it.

23:46.251 --> 23:48.667
Now I've become
someone like you.

23:49.167 --> 23:51.209
Can't you tell me,

23:52.167 --> 23:54.209
who killed your father?

23:55.459 --> 23:58.459
I'm gonna kill him myself,
I swear.

23:59.251 --> 24:02.042
That's the only reason
why I'm still alive.

24:10.667 --> 24:12.001
Sook-hee!

24:12.584 --> 24:14.459
Don't come! Please!

24:15.292 --> 24:16.292
Sook-hee!

24:16.501 --> 24:17.917
It's all my fault!

24:18.209 --> 24:20.917
Stay back! Please!
Sook-hee! Sook-hee!

24:33.751 --> 24:35.709
I told you to stay back!

24:56.876 --> 25:00.917
My darling, I feel terrible.

25:01.751 --> 25:04.917
I wasn't the one
who killed your dad.

25:08.084 --> 25:10.834
What do you mean?

25:13.834 --> 25:17.084
We were like brothers,

25:17.709 --> 25:20.584
I couldn't do it
with my own hands.

25:26.209 --> 25:27.292
Check it out.

27:56.626 --> 27:57.709
Begin!

28:05.751 --> 28:08.042
Do you still want to live?

28:08.334 --> 28:10.917
Then kill the girl
before she kills you.

28:11.334 --> 28:13.167
That's the only way
for you to live.

28:13.334 --> 28:15.626
You expect me to believe that?

28:20.209 --> 28:21.209
Begin!

29:10.126 --> 29:12.251
You died for the first time.

29:13.417 --> 29:17.459
Consider yourself dead,
and live for me.

29:36.834 --> 29:38.584
Cough it up, that's $50 each.

29:38.792 --> 29:42.709
That stupid bitch,
all her training's wasted.

29:44.876 --> 29:45.917
Where's my wallet?

29:46.042 --> 29:47.167
Cough it up.

29:47.417 --> 29:48.459
What's this?

29:48.667 --> 29:51.876
Sook-hee's favorite color,
food, sleeping habits!

29:51.959 --> 29:53.001
Let go! Let go!

29:53.126 --> 29:54.334
Number of toilet visits.

29:54.501 --> 29:55.751
Look at this guy.

29:55.917 --> 29:57.584
Bee-lining for that promotion, eh?

29:57.709 --> 30:01.667
I hope you don't get killed
on your first mission.

30:02.167 --> 30:04.417
Why did you say that?
That's bad luck.

30:04.834 --> 30:08.167
We're kidding around,
don't get your panties in a knot.

30:08.917 --> 30:10.084
(Don't get Piss)”

30:10.459 --> 30:11.709
You got a thing for her?

30:11.876 --> 30:14.251
No, it's all about
the promotion.

30:30.834 --> 30:32.084
We're here.

30:47.667 --> 30:49.501
It's your first mission.

30:50.251 --> 30:51.834
If you succeed, you get out.

30:52.584 --> 30:53.834
Who's the target?

30:54.917 --> 30:57.251
When I receive orders,
I assign them.

30:57.917 --> 30:59.626
And you kill.

31:00.001 --> 31:04.167
Tell me if you're not ready,
others are itching to go.

32:57.667 --> 33:00.542
Sook-hee,
don't ever come out.

33:10.251 --> 33:12.084
Is this what you want?

33:13.084 --> 33:14.209
Take it.

34:10.042 --> 34:11.876
Boss!

37:46.167 --> 37:48.501
You know the White Oval
that has been stolen?

37:48.667 --> 37:49.876
White Oval?

37:50.251 --> 37:51.667
This is it.

37:54.084 --> 37:55.459
It's a secret.

38:02.501 --> 38:04.042
My baby's up?

38:06.917 --> 38:09.084
Sweetie, isn't it pretty?

38:09.834 --> 38:10.834
What is this?

38:10.959 --> 38:14.626
When you get married,
this'll be my present to you.

38:14.834 --> 38:16.959
I'm so jealous!

38:21.542 --> 38:22.876
Fuck!

38:23.167 --> 38:24.876
Where did he hide it?

38:26.001 --> 38:30.042
I should've asked him
before they killed him.

38:37.709 --> 38:40.001
Where could it be?

38:41.292 --> 38:44.042
Where...

38:46.209 --> 38:48.876
Let me think...

38:53.042 --> 38:56.709
I heard you recently
scored a big one.

38:56.876 --> 39:00.042
Fucking bitch!
Shut your fucking hole!

39:00.792 --> 39:03.834
If that was true,
I wouldn't be in this hell!

39:04.459 --> 39:07.709
Why do you always
ask for more money?

39:12.001 --> 39:13.417
Where are you off to?

39:13.626 --> 39:14.626
Sook-hee!

39:14.876 --> 39:16.751
Sook-hee! Sook-hee!

39:17.126 --> 39:18.959
You bitch! Stop!

39:19.292 --> 39:20.667
Come here!

39:25.501 --> 39:27.126
Goddamn bitch!

40:14.959 --> 40:16.084
Who sent you?

40:16.584 --> 40:19.417
How much did he pay you?
I'll pay 5 times!

40:19.584 --> 40:21.584
No, 10 times!

41:02.917 --> 41:03.917
One!

41:04.334 --> 41:05.334
Two!

41:05.709 --> 41:07.584
First 5 to reach HQ!

41:08.334 --> 41:09.459
Run faster!

41:10.584 --> 41:11.917
Sook-hee!

41:15.126 --> 41:17.542
You were gonna leave
without a goodbye?

41:18.084 --> 41:19.876
I'll be discharged soon,

41:20.542 --> 41:22.042
so get settled.

41:22.417 --> 41:27.501
You'll see her if she doesn't
die before you leave.

41:33.417 --> 41:36.001
When you get out, call me.

41:36.876 --> 41:38.917
So melodramatic.

41:57.584 --> 42:00.042
It's a dossier on
your new identity.

42:00.709 --> 42:02.917
Memorize it as if
your life is depended on it.

42:10.042 --> 42:11.084
What's this?

42:11.667 --> 42:15.084
It's still a home,
a frame is a must.

42:39.667 --> 42:40.709
I'm so sorry.

42:41.876 --> 42:42.876
Eun-hye, are you okay?

42:43.709 --> 42:44.751
Were you scared?

42:49.584 --> 42:51.501
Are you moving in today?

42:52.542 --> 42:53.542
Yes.

42:54.001 --> 42:57.459
With surge in house deposit,
I looked everywhere,

42:58.084 --> 42:59.209
and ended up here...

42:59.417 --> 43:02.501
But I'm not saying
it's a bad neighbourhood.

43:02.709 --> 43:05.709
It's close to a mountain,
fresh air,

43:06.667 --> 43:08.959
and even great people too.

43:15.042 --> 43:16.417
That's pretty.

43:16.626 --> 43:18.042
Who gave it to you?

43:19.501 --> 43:22.751
Sweetie, would you like a candy?

43:30.251 --> 43:33.417
Eun-hye, I told you not to
accept things from strangers.

43:33.709 --> 43:35.209
It's an expensive candy.

43:35.626 --> 43:37.209
Doesn't contain much sugar.

43:38.792 --> 43:40.001
You can have it.

43:40.167 --> 43:40.792
Eat it.

43:40.917 --> 43:41.917
Let's go.

43:49.792 --> 43:51.334
Sweetie, stay on this side.

43:51.709 --> 43:52.751
Over here.

43:56.876 --> 43:57.917
What is it?

44:03.501 --> 44:04.876
My home...

44:07.126 --> 44:08.626
I live here.

44:17.084 --> 44:19.084
Are you in 407?

44:21.459 --> 44:23.209
We're neighbours?

44:23.709 --> 44:25.584
Moving on the same day too?

44:26.834 --> 44:30.501
Are you moving in
without your husband?

44:30.834 --> 44:32.417
Are you divorced?

44:33.001 --> 44:34.626
Overseas business trip.

44:35.126 --> 44:37.834
Business trip?
On moving day?

44:38.126 --> 44:39.876
That's not right!

44:40.251 --> 44:41.876
Then why are you alone?

44:42.584 --> 44:45.292
My wife passed away
a few years ago.

44:47.542 --> 44:49.667
It's okay, you didn't
do it on purpose.

44:50.584 --> 44:51.834
I'm sorry.

44:52.709 --> 44:54.459
Let's go inside.

45:07.792 --> 45:08.792
One moment!

45:09.084 --> 45:10.084
Me?

45:10.251 --> 45:11.417
Pizza?

45:12.251 --> 45:13.251
Yes.

45:17.876 --> 45:18.959
Yes?

45:25.626 --> 45:26.626
What are you doing?

45:26.709 --> 45:28.084
I paid for that.

45:28.501 --> 45:29.167
What for?

45:29.292 --> 45:31.501
Pizza tastes great,

45:31.626 --> 45:33.917
but it's not nutritious
for the kids.

45:34.209 --> 45:39.001
So I was thinking of
making boiled chicken,

45:39.251 --> 45:40.834
if you like chicken...

45:40.959 --> 45:42.584
Do you like chicken?

45:43.959 --> 45:45.792
Good, that wasn't too bad.

45:46.042 --> 45:47.501
We're almost friends.

45:52.459 --> 45:53.459
What is it?

45:54.084 --> 45:56.292
Chief, I need a background check.

45:56.667 --> 45:58.042
Background check?

45:58.542 --> 46:01.459
There's a man next door,
something's off.

46:02.292 --> 46:04.792
Okay, I'll look into it.

46:08.834 --> 46:10.126
Jung Hyun-soo

46:10.959 --> 46:12.334
Chief, how was I?

46:12.584 --> 46:14.584
Doesn't it look like
she's into me?

46:14.834 --> 46:17.417
She asked for
your background check.

46:18.417 --> 46:19.959
She did what?

46:21.001 --> 46:23.792
It's because you
came onto her too hard.

46:24.584 --> 46:26.084
This is fieldwork.

46:26.292 --> 46:27.709
But she's at my doorstep.

46:27.876 --> 46:31.042
Don't joke around with
background check.

46:35.209 --> 46:36.292
Here.

46:39.084 --> 46:40.876
Why do you have this?

46:41.209 --> 46:44.084
Are you from Yanbian?

46:45.042 --> 46:48.542
She was Korean-Chinese.
How did you know?

46:49.459 --> 46:50.459
Nothing.

46:52.667 --> 46:54.917
Since we're neighbours,

46:55.251 --> 46:57.084
can I get your name?

46:59.626 --> 47:01.542
Yeon-soo, Chae Yeon-soo.

47:02.501 --> 47:03.667
I'm a 'sod too.

47:03.917 --> 47:04.917
Pardon'?

47:05.251 --> 47:07.042
Hyun-soo, Jung Hyun-soo.

47:07.709 --> 47:09.709
Chae Yeon-soo,
Jung Hyun-soo.

47:10.626 --> 47:13.751
You're Yeon-soo,
I'm Hyun-soo!

47:13.917 --> 47:15.751
2 neighboursoo!

47:20.584 --> 47:23.209
How's chicken soo-p for dinner?

47:28.209 --> 47:31.959
Jung Hyun-soo,
33-year old,

47:32.459 --> 47:35.626
works at Daesung Corp.,
Development team,

47:36.584 --> 47:38.334
a widower of 3 years.

47:38.667 --> 47:40.126
Cause of death?

47:41.584 --> 47:42.959
Robbery, murder.

47:43.542 --> 47:44.542
What?

47:44.626 --> 47:47.084
She was pregnant at the time.

47:47.292 --> 47:50.251
He took 3 years off
and started working recently,

47:50.709 --> 47:53.584
he sold their home
and moved there.

48:01.751 --> 48:04.001
Does this go to Hyehwa station?

48:04.334 --> 48:05.917
That's what it says.

48:06.209 --> 48:07.417
So it does.

48:09.001 --> 48:10.834
I left my wallet at home...

48:10.959 --> 48:13.126
Just hop on, I won't charge you!

48:13.251 --> 48:14.251
For free?

48:14.459 --> 48:17.709
I need to buy lunch later too...

48:17.876 --> 48:19.792
And take a bus back home.

48:20.459 --> 48:21.209
I should run home.

48:21.334 --> 48:23.334
You can't even borrow
money at work?

48:23.542 --> 48:25.126
No, I'm a loner.

48:32.917 --> 48:34.209
Bye.

48:41.959 --> 48:43.876
- Say bye to mum.
- Bye-bye, mum.

49:03.876 --> 49:05.209
Rock, paper, scissors!

49:42.751 --> 49:43.959
Hyun-soo.

49:46.334 --> 49:48.251
Did you wait for me?

49:49.917 --> 49:50.917
I like it.

49:51.334 --> 49:52.334
What?

49:53.126 --> 49:56.001
I like to wait.

50:02.917 --> 50:04.334
Do you...

50:05.917 --> 50:07.876
like plays?

50:09.626 --> 50:11.251
Wait, are you...

50:11.917 --> 50:14.917
asking me out on a date?

50:15.459 --> 50:18.917
But you're married,
you really shouldn't.

50:19.251 --> 50:20.667
Actually,

50:20.917 --> 50:22.251
I'm in a play.

50:24.917 --> 50:26.792
You're an actress?

50:27.126 --> 50:29.751
No wonder, you're so pretty.

50:29.917 --> 50:31.209
I'm the star.

50:33.084 --> 50:34.501
Mummy!

50:34.667 --> 50:35.959
MY princess!

50:36.292 --> 50:38.334
How did you know I was coming?

50:38.626 --> 50:41.542
She said it was time
for you to come home,

50:41.917 --> 50:43.167
she was right on.

50:43.292 --> 50:46.167
Mummy and mister together?

51:10.167 --> 51:11.584
Cobalt.

51:25.042 --> 51:29.292
After finding out that you're alive,
I couldn't do anything.

51:30.751 --> 51:34.751
You still haven't changed a bit.

51:36.501 --> 51:41.042
I can't get it out of my head,
you acting.

51:42.126 --> 51:43.251
Was it weird?

51:43.417 --> 51:47.292
Not at all!
It was really good.

51:49.042 --> 51:51.542
It feels like I'm
becoming a new person,

51:51.834 --> 51:53.792
when I'm on the stage.

52:01.792 --> 52:03.542
That tie suits you.

52:03.667 --> 52:05.084
Um, yeah?

52:05.876 --> 52:08.501
It was a gift from my wife.

52:09.542 --> 52:14.042
My husband has a similar
cobalt necktie.

52:14.959 --> 52:16.626
It was my present.

52:32.126 --> 52:33.917
I love this color.

52:34.876 --> 52:39.126
I wanted to tie it myself
on our wedding day.

52:40.917 --> 52:42.542
Alright, boss.

52:43.792 --> 52:46.001
I got work in Seoul,
so I'll head over first.

52:46.251 --> 52:47.959
Good, take care.

52:48.792 --> 52:50.667
You won't stay for the wedding?

52:50.834 --> 52:52.876
You'll be in Seoul
for your honeymoon.

52:53.209 --> 52:56.126
I'll head over first
and set things up.

53:33.334 --> 53:35.084
Mister, look at that!

53:47.001 --> 53:48.209
Not gonna eat?

53:49.084 --> 53:52.501
Let's live a normal life.

53:59.251 --> 54:00.251
Yes?

54:02.459 --> 54:03.501
What?

54:05.501 --> 54:06.501
I understand.

54:09.292 --> 54:10.751
Something wrong?

54:11.542 --> 54:14.834
Chun-mo is taken,
go back to the hotel.

54:15.042 --> 54:16.251
I'll come with you.

54:16.417 --> 54:18.042
It's our honeymoon.

54:18.917 --> 54:21.042
Listen to me and head back.

54:49.959 --> 54:51.001
Yes?

54:52.459 --> 54:56.334
Joong-sang told me
not to tell you.

54:57.001 --> 55:01.709
We tracked your father's
real killer,

55:01.917 --> 55:03.834
and he asked me
to take care of it.

55:04.584 --> 55:07.209
But when I was taken hostage,

55:07.709 --> 55:09.501
he tried to rescue me...

55:09.626 --> 55:11.334
Where are they?

55:12.917 --> 55:14.459
Tell me!

55:20.292 --> 55:22.209
I had so much fun today.

55:26.501 --> 55:28.417
I know it's wrong,

55:30.001 --> 55:36.042
but for a second, I wished
you weren't married.

55:51.917 --> 55:52.917
Mrs. Chae?

55:53.167 --> 55:54.167
Yes, ma'am?

55:54.334 --> 55:55.834
Eun-hye is asleep,

55:56.001 --> 55:58.917
I got a feast to prep,
I have to leave.

55:59.126 --> 56:02.709
I'm almost there,
could you wait a bit?

56:04.084 --> 56:05.084
Okay.

56:05.584 --> 56:07.959
Sir, could you stop the cab?

56:08.626 --> 56:10.626
There's still a way to go.

56:12.584 --> 56:17.209
It'd be awkward if your babysitter
saw us together again.

56:20.917 --> 56:21.917
Hyun-soo!

56:22.459 --> 56:23.626
Go ahead.

57:03.792 --> 57:05.667
I have something to tell you.

57:06.917 --> 57:08.542
To be honest,

57:09.001 --> 57:11.042
my husband passed away.

57:12.834 --> 57:14.501
I already knew.

57:15.167 --> 57:16.917
But how?

57:17.667 --> 57:22.917
You are perfect at acting,

57:24.167 --> 57:26.417
but terrible at lying.

57:54.001 --> 57:54.834
I'm sorry.

57:54.959 --> 57:57.209
No, I'm okay.

58:32.959 --> 58:34.292
Don't answer.

58:35.667 --> 58:38.542
I'm sorry, it's an urgent call.

58:45.751 --> 58:46.876
Yes?

59:00.834 --> 59:02.917
A colleague got into
an accident,

59:03.751 --> 59:05.959
and is en route to the hospital.

59:07.917 --> 59:09.126
Hyun-soo.

59:09.792 --> 59:13.334
Could you sleep here
just for tonight?

59:13.709 --> 59:15.792
Eun-hye will be alone.

59:17.584 --> 59:19.917
Don't worry, be safe.

59:31.417 --> 59:32.542
Sook-hee!

59:33.959 --> 59:34.959
Min-ju!

59:36.209 --> 59:37.417
Why are you here?

59:37.626 --> 59:38.917
Isn't it obvious?

59:40.209 --> 59:41.834
I got my first mission.

59:42.126 --> 59:43.542
Your Southern accent is gone.

59:43.667 --> 59:44.292
Of course.

59:44.542 --> 59:46.834
When I discharge,
I'll be living in Seoul.

59:47.209 --> 59:49.584
Seoul must be treating you well.

59:52.084 --> 59:53.626
You got a man?

59:53.792 --> 59:55.917
Right? Tell me!

59:56.167 --> 59:57.209
Of course not.

59:57.417 --> 59:59.584
You can't fool me.

01:00:11.459 --> 01:00:12.459
Hey.

01:00:12.626 --> 01:00:14.459
Why's the mood so weird?

01:00:15.334 --> 01:00:16.917
This is all wrong.

01:00:17.084 --> 01:00:18.542
I'll undress you.

01:00:19.084 --> 01:00:20.084
Very good.

01:00:20.459 --> 01:00:23.001
Drinking isn't the only thing
I came here for.

01:00:25.751 --> 01:00:26.876
Come here, baby.

01:00:27.001 --> 01:00:28.792
Let me feel you.

01:00:29.334 --> 01:00:31.001
I think I'm drunk.

01:00:31.209 --> 01:00:32.917
What are you doing?

01:00:33.959 --> 01:00:35.001
One second.

01:00:35.542 --> 01:00:36.542
Why?

01:00:36.709 --> 01:00:38.209
Washroom...

01:00:39.959 --> 01:00:41.917
Come on, hurry up.

01:00:43.459 --> 01:00:44.792
Continue.

01:00:45.542 --> 01:00:47.709
Take that off,
finish undressing.

01:01:01.459 --> 01:01:03.167
Did you take my phone?

01:01:05.917 --> 01:01:08.042
I'll return it, let her go.

01:01:10.542 --> 01:01:13.501
You must've made a copy.

01:01:14.126 --> 01:01:15.167
Give it.

01:01:57.167 --> 01:01:58.501
Fucking bitch!

01:02:09.417 --> 01:02:11.292
Min-ju, are you alright?

01:02:49.042 --> 01:02:50.917
Get her to the ER!

01:02:52.542 --> 01:02:54.334
She lost too much blood!

01:02:54.667 --> 01:02:56.167
Flash drive.

01:02:58.417 --> 01:03:00.209
- Start hacking.
- Yes, ma'am.

01:03:06.459 --> 01:03:07.584
We can't do it here.

01:03:07.917 --> 01:03:09.167
Go to the ER!

01:03:09.751 --> 01:03:10.917
Let's head back.

01:03:12.167 --> 01:03:14.459
Min-ju'll die!
She'll die like this!

01:03:14.584 --> 01:03:15.667
That's why!

01:03:18.667 --> 01:03:21.959
You should've done
your job properly.

01:04:19.834 --> 01:04:21.167
Yeon-soo, you okay?

01:04:39.126 --> 01:04:40.959
Let it all out.

01:04:56.167 --> 01:04:58.209
Choi Chun-mo who emerged
during this op,

01:04:58.917 --> 01:05:01.751
is known as
a mid-level boss

01:05:02.251 --> 01:05:05.459
of a contract killer organization,

01:05:05.667 --> 01:05:08.876
and controls over
5 mid-size subsidiaries.

01:05:09.167 --> 01:05:11.501
Using data from our hard drive,

01:05:11.834 --> 01:05:14.042
Choi became a major player,

01:05:14.209 --> 01:05:18.251
and his pawn Sook-hee
was recruited to the agency?

01:05:19.459 --> 01:05:21.334
Isn't that fishy?

01:05:22.417 --> 01:05:23.501
Wait a minute,

01:05:23.834 --> 01:05:26.417
then she's been a double agent?

01:05:27.209 --> 01:05:31.042
We've put an agent to watch her,
and there aren't any issues.

01:05:31.876 --> 01:05:37.417
Choi is someone who eliminated
her husband to reach his level.

01:05:37.626 --> 01:05:39.417
Enough about his back story,

01:05:39.667 --> 01:05:42.709
we need to catch his
puppet master.

01:05:42.876 --> 01:05:46.626
We've received intel that
they'll contact HIN.

01:05:46.917 --> 01:05:48.209
We'll move in then.

01:05:48.459 --> 01:05:51.001
Why don't we assign her?

01:05:58.084 --> 01:06:00.709
Did you make Mum cry?

01:06:01.417 --> 01:06:03.001
I... didn't...

01:06:03.584 --> 01:06:05.667
I consoled her.

01:06:06.001 --> 01:06:08.542
What does that mean?

01:06:08.876 --> 01:06:10.209
Consoling is,

01:06:10.417 --> 01:06:15.042
when you cry,
I say "don't cry."

01:06:15.501 --> 01:06:18.584
Can you console Mummy?

01:06:19.042 --> 01:06:20.042
What do you mean?

01:06:20.584 --> 01:06:23.042
When mummy cries,

01:06:24.792 --> 01:06:29.209
you say,
"don't cry, don't cry."

01:06:33.626 --> 01:06:34.959
You're up?

01:06:35.251 --> 01:06:36.834
Sit down, food's getting cold.

01:06:37.042 --> 01:06:40.542
I'm full, and sleepy.

01:06:53.042 --> 01:06:55.167
Did she bug you?

01:06:55.584 --> 01:06:56.917
She said,

01:06:57.959 --> 01:07:00.542
I should console you
whenever you cry.

01:07:01.417 --> 01:07:03.126
Can I do that?

01:07:04.917 --> 01:07:07.626
The me that you know

01:07:09.209 --> 01:07:10.792
isn't the real me.

01:07:12.001 --> 01:07:14.334
That's what
I wanted to tell you.

01:07:15.042 --> 01:07:16.042
What?

01:07:16.917 --> 01:07:20.709
I'm not the person
you think you know.

01:07:21.417 --> 01:07:23.126
I'm a terrible person.

01:07:23.751 --> 01:07:31.417
But if you're okay with that,
I want to be by your side.

01:07:35.459 --> 01:07:36.626
No.

01:07:37.584 --> 01:07:43.334
If you knew the real me,
you'd run away.

01:07:44.709 --> 01:07:48.751
No matter who you are,
what you're into,

01:07:52.042 --> 01:07:54.126
I will never leave your side.

01:07:58.126 --> 01:08:00.709
Are you saying
you want to get married?

01:08:01.417 --> 01:08:02.792
If I get killed,

01:08:03.917 --> 01:08:06.167
Eun-hye will be all alone.

01:08:14.626 --> 01:08:17.459
I'll reserve the wedding hall
and hire some guests.

01:08:18.334 --> 01:08:19.626
Pardon'?

01:08:21.959 --> 01:08:23.876
Will you do it yourself?

01:08:24.709 --> 01:08:25.876
Endure it.

01:08:26.876 --> 01:08:31.959
When she reaches junior high,
you'll live a normal life.

01:08:44.584 --> 01:08:48.001
Hyun-soo, we can get married.

01:08:49.834 --> 01:08:54.042
You see? I told you
your parents would approve it.

01:08:56.584 --> 01:09:02.251
Whatever happens,
let's trust each other.

01:09:05.167 --> 01:09:06.751
Yes, I'll do that.

01:09:08.709 --> 01:09:10.917
I'll trust you from here on.

01:09:12.709 --> 01:09:17.417
Whatever happens,
I'll trust you.

01:09:18.292 --> 01:09:19.959
You promised.

01:09:56.959 --> 01:10:00.084
You look like
you've seen a ghost.

01:10:01.042 --> 01:10:03.459
I heard you were
working in Japan.

01:10:04.834 --> 01:10:06.126
Why are you here?

01:10:06.917 --> 01:10:09.417
I heard you got Min-ju killed.

01:10:12.917 --> 01:10:14.876
You should've done a better job.

01:10:15.167 --> 01:10:17.584
It'd have been good
if she were here.

01:10:31.626 --> 01:10:35.459
A bride shouldn't frown,
put on a smile.

01:10:35.876 --> 01:10:38.709
Chief wants me to
submit our selfie.

01:10:39.542 --> 01:10:40.876
Chief

01:10:41.001 --> 01:10:46.167
Speak of the devil,
it's the chief.

01:10:49.501 --> 01:10:50.751
Yes, chief.

01:10:51.084 --> 01:10:52.667
Put Sook-hee on.

01:10:54.959 --> 01:10:56.084
Answer.

01:11:03.792 --> 01:11:04.792
Yes?

01:11:04.876 --> 01:11:07.042
Get to the washroom right away.

01:11:11.167 --> 01:11:13.626
There are parts of
PSG-1 in the toilet.

01:11:29.751 --> 01:11:33.459
Through the fan,
adjacent building 4th floor.

01:11:48.126 --> 01:11:50.334
Snipe the man in sunglasses.

01:12:31.917 --> 01:12:33.334
Shoot him!

01:12:38.917 --> 01:12:40.126
That man,

01:12:41.084 --> 01:12:41.959
who is he?

01:12:42.084 --> 01:12:45.001
You do not question the target.

01:12:45.334 --> 01:12:47.584
Miss, the ceremony
is about to begin.

01:13:31.709 --> 01:13:32.917
Sook-hee!

01:13:33.501 --> 01:13:34.501
Sook-hee!

01:13:35.042 --> 01:13:36.084
Wait!

01:13:36.626 --> 01:13:38.709
You'll die if you go in.

01:13:38.917 --> 01:13:40.792
He wouldn't have wanted this.

01:13:43.292 --> 01:13:44.917
Without him,

01:13:45.626 --> 01:13:47.501
I can't go on.

01:14:26.501 --> 01:14:27.751
Don't cry.

01:14:29.167 --> 01:14:30.834
It's a good day.

01:14:40.584 --> 01:14:44.042
How could our dearest Sook-hee
make a mistake like this?

01:14:44.167 --> 01:14:44.917
Shut it.

01:14:45.001 --> 01:14:46.667
Wrap it up and exfil.

01:14:47.292 --> 01:14:49.626
Did you bring me in for this?

01:14:49.751 --> 01:14:52.876
Take out the target
that she missed.

01:15:33.251 --> 01:15:37.542
Doesn't she look familiar?

01:15:40.167 --> 01:15:41.667
I'm not sure...

01:15:42.417 --> 01:15:43.917
Anything unusual about her?

01:15:44.501 --> 01:15:46.251
Her guests were paid off.

01:15:46.501 --> 01:15:47.834
Hired guests?

01:15:49.209 --> 01:15:51.834
Boss, maybe it's her
second marriage.

01:15:53.459 --> 01:15:56.292
Maybe for him too.

01:15:57.042 --> 01:15:59.584
Both sides used hired guests.

01:16:04.501 --> 01:16:09.292
You still haven't changed a bit.

01:16:13.251 --> 01:16:14.334
No.

01:16:16.501 --> 01:16:17.959
I've changed.

01:16:18.209 --> 01:16:20.042
Please trust me once more.

01:16:21.334 --> 01:16:23.209
I know one thing for certain.

01:16:24.917 --> 01:16:28.417
We cannot exist
in the same space.

01:16:35.334 --> 01:16:37.584
As long as you're alive,

01:16:40.626 --> 01:16:42.001
I cannot live.

01:17:13.709 --> 01:17:14.917
Yeon-soo.

01:17:22.917 --> 01:17:24.542
I gotta take this.

01:18:14.876 --> 01:18:17.167
Do you recognise me?

01:18:18.584 --> 01:18:20.417
Who are you?

01:18:22.834 --> 01:18:26.542
You may not know me,

01:18:28.042 --> 01:18:30.126
but I know you very well.

01:18:32.209 --> 01:18:37.001
People will soon love you,
just as I do.

01:18:37.792 --> 01:18:39.917
Could you leave me alone?

01:18:52.417 --> 01:18:53.917
Do I offend you?

01:18:54.917 --> 01:18:56.792
My husband will be back soon.

01:18:58.042 --> 01:19:02.834
Didn't you love someone
more than your current husband?

01:19:05.751 --> 01:19:11.334
You must know a lot
about actress Chae Yeon-soo.

01:19:11.876 --> 01:19:12.876
Yes.

01:19:14.167 --> 01:19:15.792
And I wish to know more.

01:19:22.876 --> 01:19:28.459
After losing the love
of her life,

01:19:31.626 --> 01:19:34.959
she chose the stage
to forget him.

01:19:36.251 --> 01:19:41.292
But he comes back
from death and onto the stage.

01:19:42.501 --> 01:19:47.042
If she has to kill him
in order to live,

01:19:48.959 --> 01:19:51.001
what would you do?

01:19:54.792 --> 01:19:55.959
If...

01:19:57.917 --> 01:19:59.584
that's the case...

01:20:05.542 --> 01:20:10.542
it'd be the saddest thing
in the world.

01:20:21.292 --> 01:20:22.834
I'm sorry.

01:20:26.084 --> 01:20:31.084
I've mistaken you
for a woman I loved.

01:20:32.501 --> 01:20:35.126
I'll leave you now.

01:20:57.626 --> 01:21:00.292
She's taking it hard
after that mission.

01:21:00.501 --> 01:21:02.584
Why'd she make
a mistake like that?

01:21:02.751 --> 01:21:05.834
She was ordered to kill
on her wedding day,

01:21:06.126 --> 01:21:08.792
who wouldn't make that mistake?

01:21:09.501 --> 01:21:13.584
Don't confuse yourself,
your marriage is your mission.

01:21:14.167 --> 01:21:15.542
Who...

01:21:17.042 --> 01:21:18.792
was the target?

01:21:54.959 --> 01:21:55.834
What?

01:21:55.959 --> 01:21:57.167
You alright?

01:22:00.792 --> 01:22:01.917
I'm fine.

01:22:13.792 --> 01:22:15.001
Mister.

01:22:16.084 --> 01:22:17.584
I can't wear...

01:22:17.959 --> 01:22:19.876
bra with this dress,

01:22:20.876 --> 01:22:22.417
did you know?

01:22:27.417 --> 01:22:29.917
What did you imagine just now?

01:22:34.584 --> 01:22:36.084
I sure did.

01:22:56.626 --> 01:22:59.126
If you promise to stay with me,

01:22:59.667 --> 01:23:01.959
I'll forget about revenge,

01:23:02.667 --> 01:23:05.084
and live a normal life.

01:23:06.626 --> 01:23:08.167
Revenge?

01:23:10.126 --> 01:23:11.959
Isn't that over?

01:23:17.959 --> 01:23:22.001
The one who killed my dad
was someone else.

01:23:24.917 --> 01:23:26.584
Who was it?

01:23:29.667 --> 01:23:31.292
You met your target.

01:23:33.876 --> 01:23:38.417
It was a coincidence.
He was a fan of the play.

01:23:42.251 --> 01:23:43.459
Coincidence?

01:23:43.584 --> 01:23:45.917
Failing the mission
was a coincidence too?

01:23:46.834 --> 01:23:49.542
Don't forget what
you're living for.

01:23:50.126 --> 01:23:52.042
Once you forget that,

01:23:52.459 --> 01:23:56.667
you and your family
will be wiped off.

01:24:01.667 --> 01:24:03.834
Are you threatening me?

01:24:05.917 --> 01:24:08.126
No, I'm advising you.

01:24:51.917 --> 01:24:52.917
What is it?

01:24:52.959 --> 01:24:54.626
From a fan.

01:25:02.209 --> 01:25:03.667
Your greatest fan...

01:25:09.126 --> 01:25:10.459
What is it?

01:25:13.251 --> 01:25:14.251
Where are you going?

01:25:14.501 --> 01:25:15.876
I'm a guest actress.

01:25:16.251 --> 01:25:17.792
And also your fixer.

01:26:02.626 --> 01:26:05.042
She was ordered to kill
on her wedding day,

01:26:05.209 --> 01:26:07.709
who wouldn't make that mistake?

01:26:08.251 --> 01:26:12.292
Don't confuse yourself,
your marriage is your mission.

01:26:13.459 --> 01:26:16.542
Who was the target?

01:26:19.959 --> 01:26:21.584
Your greatest fan...

01:26:24.751 --> 01:26:26.042
A woman

01:26:27.834 --> 01:26:29.959
is sent to kill you.

01:26:41.459 --> 01:26:42.167
Don't move!

01:26:42.292 --> 01:26:43.792
Not a single step, assholes!

01:26:43.917 --> 01:26:44.917
You see this?

01:26:45.167 --> 01:26:48.751
If I press this, we're all dead!

01:27:30.042 --> 01:27:32.584
Kim-sun was taken by the target,
stay on Sook-hee.

01:27:32.709 --> 01:27:34.584
She could be unpredictable.

01:27:35.001 --> 01:27:37.834
Is the target her ex-husband?

01:27:38.126 --> 01:27:39.626
Don't dig any deeper!

01:27:39.792 --> 01:27:41.834
He must die for her to live.

01:27:45.542 --> 01:27:47.042
Trust me, Hyun-soo.

01:27:47.917 --> 01:27:49.709
I'm off to Yanbian.

01:27:55.167 --> 01:27:56.876
What are you doing here?

01:27:57.917 --> 01:28:01.459
My mother's ill.

01:28:01.792 --> 01:28:03.876
I better go and look after her.

01:28:12.542 --> 01:28:16.751
Take care of Eun-hye
while I'm away.

01:28:17.001 --> 01:28:19.751
Call me if anything happens.

01:28:23.292 --> 01:28:25.042
I doubt anything will happen.

01:28:25.959 --> 01:28:30.334
Because you're always
looking after me.

01:28:32.792 --> 01:28:34.917
Yeon-soo, I love you.

01:29:34.959 --> 01:29:36.417
Sook-hee.

01:29:37.917 --> 01:29:39.292
Remember her?

01:29:46.751 --> 01:29:47.751
Send this.

01:29:51.542 --> 01:29:53.876
I wanted you to kill him.

01:29:55.126 --> 01:29:56.126
Then,

01:29:56.459 --> 01:29:59.251
you'd have lived happily
with your husband and child.

01:29:59.959 --> 01:30:01.959
Now you're all in danger.

01:30:04.417 --> 01:30:06.834
My husband Jung Hyun-soo.

01:30:08.001 --> 01:30:10.584
The agency's lapdog-

01:30:11.417 --> 01:30:13.626
Did you belittle me?

01:30:13.876 --> 01:30:17.251
When I asked for your
permission to marry him!

01:30:20.042 --> 01:30:21.834
Watch your mouth.

01:30:27.292 --> 01:30:29.917
Hostage exchange at midnight,
Dongjin complex rooftop.

01:30:30.001 --> 01:30:31.334
Jung Hyun-soo

01:30:35.167 --> 01:30:36.626
How did it go?

01:30:37.626 --> 01:30:39.584
I'll report to you by tomorrow.

01:30:40.876 --> 01:30:42.084
Chief,

01:30:43.501 --> 01:30:46.667
I can't reach Sook-hee,
is something wrong?

01:30:48.917 --> 01:30:50.876
She's sick,
she's at the hospital.

01:30:51.001 --> 01:30:52.709
Where is she sick?

01:30:53.584 --> 01:30:55.001
Is it bad?

01:30:57.292 --> 01:30:58.792
Take care of Eun-hye.

01:30:58.917 --> 01:31:00.542
Head back home.

01:31:09.417 --> 01:31:10.917
Daddy's here!

01:31:13.626 --> 01:31:15.084
Daddy!

01:31:18.251 --> 01:31:19.917
How's my baby?

01:31:21.126 --> 01:31:22.876
Did you miss me?

01:31:37.251 --> 01:31:38.459
Are you okay? Sir?

01:32:10.626 --> 01:32:11.626
Sook-hee, are you okay?

01:32:11.667 --> 01:32:12.667
Mister!

01:32:13.209 --> 01:32:15.959
I have to rescue my child.

01:32:17.584 --> 01:32:19.334
Okay, we need to move.

01:32:24.709 --> 01:32:27.209
I'll go fetch her.

01:32:28.001 --> 01:32:31.501
Just in case,
take this with you.

01:33:13.417 --> 01:33:14.917
Eun-hye, wake up.

01:33:16.459 --> 01:33:17.667
Sweetie, please.

01:33:18.292 --> 01:33:19.834
Open your eyes.

01:33:23.417 --> 01:33:24.501
Baby...

01:33:25.626 --> 01:33:26.834
Eun-hye!

01:33:28.667 --> 01:33:29.917
Sook-hee...

01:33:33.042 --> 01:33:34.251
Who did this?

01:33:35.042 --> 01:33:36.209
Who?

01:33:39.042 --> 01:33:40.501
Tell me!

01:35:08.626 --> 01:35:11.292
So this is what you meant

01:35:12.626 --> 01:35:14.334
by wiping us Off?

01:35:15.126 --> 01:35:17.876
You still only believe
what you see.

01:35:18.209 --> 01:35:21.626
It wasn't us, don't you get it?

01:35:22.417 --> 01:35:23.917
No more lies!

01:35:26.084 --> 01:35:28.001
If it wasn't you,

01:35:29.334 --> 01:35:32.042
who else would do this?!

01:35:45.709 --> 01:35:47.501
Daddy, hurry!

01:35:47.876 --> 01:35:49.084
Is it pee-pee?

01:35:49.917 --> 01:35:51.709
Let's go!

01:35:59.959 --> 01:36:01.001
Eun-hye.

01:36:01.709 --> 01:36:02.709
It's okay.

01:36:02.917 --> 01:36:04.917
Are you scared?

01:36:05.917 --> 01:36:08.959
So how's our reputation in Yanbian?

01:36:10.709 --> 01:36:13.167
Did you really have to
do this to Sook-hee?

01:36:13.667 --> 01:36:14.876
Then what?

01:36:15.501 --> 01:36:18.959
Watch her do her revenge
on her father's killer?

01:36:19.292 --> 01:36:21.667
She loved Lee Joong-sang.

01:36:22.459 --> 01:36:24.584
So he married her,

01:36:25.084 --> 01:36:26.792
and even went on a honeymoon.

01:36:26.917 --> 01:36:31.126
She should've died then,
just as we had planned.

01:36:32.001 --> 01:36:34.917
Now we have to kill
her daughter too.

01:36:35.126 --> 01:36:40.001
She's Lee Joong-sangs child.

01:36:53.001 --> 01:36:55.042
- Yes, boss.
- Lee Joong-sang!

01:36:55.959 --> 01:36:57.126
Lee Joong-sang!

01:36:57.501 --> 01:36:58.501
Yes, I understand.

01:36:58.751 --> 01:37:00.126
- Yes, sir.
- Lee Joong-sang!

01:37:01.584 --> 01:37:04.834
No, sir, it's nothing at all.

01:37:04.959 --> 01:37:09.251
Tell him!
Eun-hye's his daughter!

01:37:10.626 --> 01:37:11.626
Okay.

01:37:18.626 --> 01:37:23.542
Sook-hee was already pregnant
when she arrived at the agency.

01:37:57.126 --> 01:37:58.459
I understand.

01:38:27.042 --> 01:38:29.126
He said he'll spare you.

01:38:30.792 --> 01:38:32.292
Should I do it?

01:38:35.917 --> 01:38:37.251
Fine, I'll do it.

01:38:38.584 --> 01:38:40.334
Jesus, you're quick.

01:38:40.501 --> 01:38:41.751
Hold still.

01:38:42.501 --> 01:38:43.501
Alright.

01:38:43.876 --> 01:38:44.917
(Let's Ma)'-

01:39:12.084 --> 01:39:13.334
Daddy!

01:39:13.626 --> 01:39:14.667
Daddy!

01:39:15.959 --> 01:39:17.209
Daddy...

01:39:17.459 --> 01:39:18.626
Goddamn“...

01:39:18.876 --> 01:39:20.126
Gun, gun.

01:39:21.584 --> 01:39:22.792
Gun!

01:39:27.417 --> 01:39:28.959
It's all ready.

01:39:30.917 --> 01:39:33.876
So you'll spare me?

01:39:45.417 --> 01:39:48.417
Daddy, get UP!

01:39:48.709 --> 01:39:51.292
Daddy, please!

01:39:51.917 --> 01:39:53.459
Yes, I can see her.

01:40:14.959 --> 01:40:17.084
Why're you doing this to me?

01:40:17.709 --> 01:40:18.959
Tell me!

01:40:39.501 --> 01:40:42.959
Killing me won't
change anything.

01:40:48.167 --> 01:40:53.042
But I wish you two had met
under different circumstances.

01:41:18.959 --> 01:41:20.042
Look.

01:41:20.542 --> 01:41:21.542
Chief.

01:41:22.126 --> 01:41:25.459
Can we get married for real?

01:41:26.209 --> 01:41:28.459
Agent Jung,
get your shit together!

01:41:28.667 --> 01:41:31.459
Sook-hee is a woman
who could die at any moment.

01:41:33.042 --> 01:41:35.001
But I love her.

01:41:37.792 --> 01:41:38.917
Sook-hee...

01:41:40.917 --> 01:41:44.667
She can't live with blood
on her hands forever.

01:41:47.959 --> 01:41:50.834
I didn't want you to be like me.

01:43:02.667 --> 01:43:03.834
Cease fire!

01:43:08.001 --> 01:43:10.459
Go check it out.

01:44:37.001 --> 01:44:38.542
Boss, we're out of ammo!

01:45:51.334 --> 01:45:52.876
Mister.

01:45:54.542 --> 01:45:56.792
Even for a split moment,

01:46:00.251 --> 01:46:02.709
did you ever love me?

01:46:04.917 --> 01:46:07.459
Nothing we say here,

01:46:10.501 --> 01:46:12.334
will change anything.

01:46:14.042 --> 01:46:16.334
I need to hear it,

01:46:17.167 --> 01:46:19.251
from your mouth.

01:46:27.001 --> 01:46:28.667
Sook-hee...

01:46:31.542 --> 01:46:32.876
'III

01:46:35.709 --> 01:46:37.834
loved you.

01:46:39.501 --> 01:46:44.001
But as a crime
for killing your father,

01:46:46.209 --> 01:46:48.834
I couldn't love you anymore.

01:46:57.251 --> 01:46:59.917
Is that what you wanted to hear?

01:47:06.126 --> 01:47:08.542
You want to believe that.

01:47:10.084 --> 01:47:13.542
You can choose to
live on believing that.

01:47:21.667 --> 01:47:24.667
How could you do this to me?

01:47:28.667 --> 01:47:30.792
I have that privilege.

01:47:33.167 --> 01:47:37.834
Because I made you.

01:47:42.167 --> 01:47:44.126
Let me show you.

01:47:46.834 --> 01:47:49.542
What you made me into.

01:49:19.834 --> 01:49:20.834
Boss!

01:49:20.876 --> 01:49:23.251
Boss! Cops are on the way!

01:49:24.084 --> 01:49:25.501
- Hurry!
- Yes, sir!

01:49:25.792 --> 01:49:27.042
Come on!

01:49:28.126 --> 01:49:28.917
Hurry!

01:49:29.084 --> 01:49:30.084
Get off!

01:49:31.709 --> 01:49:32.959
What is it?

01:49:33.542 --> 01:49:34.251
Get off now!

01:49:34.417 --> 01:49:35.751
Get the hell Off!

01:49:36.417 --> 01:49:37.626
Boss, hurry!

01:49:37.834 --> 01:49:38.834
Hurry UP!

01:49:42.917 --> 01:49:44.417
Boss is not here yet!

01:49:44.584 --> 01:49:46.001
Boss, please hop on!

01:49:49.917 --> 01:49:52.501
Please! Boss!

01:49:52.834 --> 01:49:55.126
Boss, come quick!

01:50:18.792 --> 01:50:19.959
Are you alright?

01:51:29.917 --> 01:51:31.042
What the fuck?!

01:51:33.251 --> 01:51:34.334
Get rid of her!

01:51:39.084 --> 01:51:40.126
Bitch!

01:56:38.834 --> 01:56:40.167
Sook-hee...

01:56:43.209 --> 01:56:45.334
Why are you shaking?

01:56:47.751 --> 01:56:49.292
So pitiful.

01:56:53.542 --> 01:56:55.459
Don't be scared.

01:56:59.042 --> 01:57:00.959
Don't be scared.

01:57:05.792 --> 01:57:07.417
Strike me.

01:57:09.209 --> 01:57:10.792
Kill me!

01:57:12.751 --> 01:57:14.459
That's when...

01:57:17.084 --> 01:57:19.417
it really begins.

01:57:23.792 --> 01:57:25.834
The real pain.

01:57:29.167 --> 01:57:35.917
Like the day I killed you.

01:59:01.084 --> 01:59:05.709
