WEBVTT

00:00.290 --> 00:02.095
Previously on "Six"...

00:02.098 --> 00:03.887
Wait, wait! I'm American!

00:03.890 --> 00:05.293
I'm from Detroit, okay?

00:05.296 --> 00:07.093
Don't...

00:07.094 --> 00:08.659
What the...

00:08.660 --> 00:10.223
He was a threat.

00:10.224 --> 00:12.465
- Erase that. - He was an
unarmed American who surrendered.

00:12.467 --> 00:15.013
Just deal with it, Caulder. This is war.

00:15.014 --> 00:17.553
And we are warriors, not savages!

00:17.554 --> 00:19.013
I won't do another op with you ever.

00:19.014 --> 00:20.463
How come you and Rip never had kids?

00:20.464 --> 00:22.843
Are you kidding me? He's
got teenage boys already.

00:22.844 --> 00:24.673
Boko Haram captured Richard Taggart,

00:24.674 --> 00:26.446
former troop chief of this command.

00:27.384 --> 00:28.723
He's there because of you.

00:28.724 --> 00:31.133
What are you doing, Michael?

00:31.134 --> 00:32.923
What needs to be done.

00:32.924 --> 00:34.673
Your new owners have arrived.

00:34.674 --> 00:36.173
I got a dead Boko Haram.

00:36.174 --> 00:37.554
What the hell?

00:40.924 --> 00:44.051
These are soldiers.
Trained, geared up, armored.

00:46.554 --> 00:49.054
Akmal, show us what Esther
and Na'omi are wearing.

00:51.464 --> 00:53.673
Make me believe it.

00:53.674 --> 00:55.883
My name is Richard Taggart.

00:55.884 --> 00:59.303
I was nothing more
than a hired assassin.

00:59.306 --> 01:00.966
Committed war crimes.

01:03.764 --> 01:06.053
The President of the United States

01:06.054 --> 01:08.463
wants to go on TV and tell the world

01:08.464 --> 01:10.515
that Richard Taggart is an American hero

01:10.518 --> 01:13.173
and that this confession
is pure bullshit.

01:13.174 --> 01:14.557
It is, right?

01:14.560 --> 01:16.053
Sir, there's no way
that Rip would say that.

01:16.054 --> 01:18.053
Not unless he was coerced... Or worse.

01:18.054 --> 01:20.843
We checked the ISR footage, and
there's a gap in the coverage

01:20.844 --> 01:22.615
when this was supposed to have happened.

01:22.617 --> 01:25.301
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> -

01:25.304 --> 01:28.203
The other Muj was turned over
to the Afghan police... SOP.

01:28.206 --> 01:30.434
-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

01:30.437 --> 01:33.647
Anything you want to
add, now is the time.

01:40.804 --> 01:42.383
Sir, we need to get Rip

01:42.384 --> 01:45.223
before they torture him any more.

01:45.224 --> 01:47.786
Did we get any news on that
Chechen we bagged in Nigeria?

01:47.789 --> 01:49.463
Yeah, we're working
on a link between him

01:49.464 --> 01:53.673
and an ex-Spetsnaz guy
named Akmal Barayev.

01:53.674 --> 01:56.554
We thought he was dead, but
turns out he might not be.

01:59.969 --> 02:02.639
Chase, Fishbait, can you
guys give us a minute?

02:07.384 --> 02:08.964
You trust me with your life, Ortiz?

02:11.634 --> 02:13.173
Yes, Chase, I do.

02:13.174 --> 02:14.383
Then trust me.

02:14.384 --> 02:16.593
You know, he's right.

02:16.594 --> 02:18.263
We're either on this team or we're not.

02:18.264 --> 02:19.723
Okay.

02:19.724 --> 02:21.223
So, what's on your mind?

02:21.224 --> 02:23.264
Everything Rip says is true, right?

02:26.976 --> 02:28.106
Of course it's true.

02:34.245 --> 02:36.513
Caulder, what'd you do with
the photo of that dead guy?

02:36.514 --> 02:38.723
The one that I took for
the shooter statement.

02:38.724 --> 02:40.384
I erased it.

02:42.046 --> 02:43.550
Who else knows about this?

02:45.554 --> 02:47.343
Just the other Muj.

02:47.344 --> 02:48.843
The one with him... The driver.

02:48.844 --> 02:50.463
This is on us.

02:50.464 --> 02:52.513
Okay? You could lose
your trident... or worse.

02:52.514 --> 02:55.133
Look, what Rip did, shooting that kid,

02:55.134 --> 02:57.053
it's not what I signed up for.

02:57.054 --> 02:59.803
The bottom line...
We're on the right side.

02:59.806 --> 03:01.524
You know what... I signed up

03:01.527 --> 03:05.336
to help people who
can't help themselves.

03:05.339 --> 03:07.173
Like those girls who got kidnapped.

03:07.176 --> 03:08.136
We all did.

03:10.724 --> 03:11.803
Okay?

03:11.804 --> 03:13.803
Stay out of this.

03:13.804 --> 03:15.763
You got a bright future.
Don't screw it up.

03:15.764 --> 03:18.379
Walk out, brother.

03:19.929 --> 03:21.429
You were never here.

03:29.464 --> 03:30.843
Ortiz residence.

03:30.844 --> 03:33.633
Who's calling?

03:33.634 --> 03:35.133
You're from New York?

03:35.134 --> 03:37.263
Oh, The New Yorker. Magazine?

03:37.264 --> 03:38.513
Give it to me.

03:38.514 --> 03:40.923
Come on, give it to me.

03:40.924 --> 03:43.264
Yes? Who are you asking about?

03:45.134 --> 03:46.633
Never heard of him.

03:46.634 --> 03:49.223
You must have the wrong number, buddy.

03:49.224 --> 03:50.692
He asked about Rip.

03:50.695 --> 03:52.479
Yeah. Come on, let's,
um... Let's have dinner.

03:52.481 --> 03:54.013
I'm not hungry.

03:54.014 --> 03:55.963
Why? You're not feeling well?

03:55.964 --> 03:58.263
Everyone was talking
about Rip today at school.

03:58.264 --> 04:00.174
I watched that video.

04:04.764 --> 04:06.723
Okay, guys.

04:06.724 --> 04:08.053
Listen to me, okay?

04:08.054 --> 04:11.013
Um... it's gonna be fine,

04:11.014 --> 04:15.763
but it's, uh... It's a tough situation.

04:15.764 --> 04:19.882
Someone is forcing Uncle Rip
to say a lot of bad things.

04:19.884 --> 04:22.464
But we're gonna bring
him back safe and sound.

04:28.123 --> 04:31.243
He was an American?
The guy that Rip killed?

04:35.764 --> 04:39.174
He might come over here and
kill Anabel and Ricky Jr.?

04:40.563 --> 04:43.477
Ricky, I made peace a long
time ago with what you do.

04:46.224 --> 04:50.723
I don't care if Rip killed him.

04:50.724 --> 04:54.513
I care about you, about us.

04:54.514 --> 04:56.674
That's what I care about.

05:02.264 --> 05:04.634
To my brothers on SEAL Team Six...

05:07.264 --> 05:10.223
...look inside your hearts.

05:10.224 --> 05:12.883
Let your better nature...

05:12.884 --> 05:16.884
let the truth... Let it shine through.

05:18.844 --> 05:22.423
It's not too late. I am proof of that.

05:22.424 --> 05:24.383
Congrats, Rip.

05:24.384 --> 05:26.263
You're a real hero now.

05:26.264 --> 05:28.351
It's already the most
popular video in the world.

05:28.354 --> 05:29.466
Recruiting's through the roof.

05:29.468 --> 05:30.856
The SEALs, your families, they're all...

05:30.858 --> 05:31.977
They won't believe it.

05:31.980 --> 05:32.963
I only said those things

05:32.964 --> 05:36.093
'cause you put a
suicide vest on a woman.

05:36.094 --> 05:38.554
And a 13-year-old child.

05:40.224 --> 05:41.384
You're right.

05:44.054 --> 05:46.093
I apologize for that.

05:46.094 --> 05:48.673
I know you love these girls.

05:48.674 --> 05:50.593
My little brother's name was Omar.

05:50.594 --> 05:52.633
It means "long lived."

05:52.634 --> 05:55.763
He was born premature.

05:55.764 --> 05:57.963
My first memory is going to the hospital

05:57.964 --> 06:00.883
and watching my mother
cry outside the ICU.

06:00.884 --> 06:03.593
She could only hold him
for 20 minutes a day.

06:03.594 --> 06:08.723
It almost bankrupted my
father, but Omar made it.

06:08.724 --> 06:10.513
He was the smallest kid on the block,

06:10.514 --> 06:12.463
but he never backed down.

06:12.464 --> 06:14.093
He hated injustice.

06:14.094 --> 06:16.924
He hated the strong preying on the weak.

06:20.224 --> 06:21.883
And then you murdered him.

06:21.886 --> 06:24.214
If you're looking for blood,
look on your own hands.

06:25.964 --> 06:29.553
Now, you're a good woman. A teacher.

06:29.554 --> 06:31.799
But you have no idea

06:31.802 --> 06:34.500
what kind of a man
Richard Taggart really is.

06:36.000 --> 06:42.074

07:12.134 --> 07:19.014
The first time Boko Haram raped me...

07:21.514 --> 07:23.360
...I wanted to die.

07:25.724 --> 07:28.383
I wanted to die.

07:28.384 --> 07:31.651
But then you told me

07:31.654 --> 07:33.694
I had to be strong for the girls.

07:35.804 --> 07:37.514
And so I was.

07:39.764 --> 07:41.922
Now you have to be strong for them.

07:43.384 --> 07:47.093
I don't care what that man says.

07:47.094 --> 07:50.723
I know one thing for sure about you.

07:50.724 --> 07:54.054
You will do anything to save us.

08:10.294 --> 08:13.223
If we don't get a handle on
these professional assassins,

08:13.224 --> 08:15.723
we're going to be hearing
about a lot more war crimes.

08:15.724 --> 08:18.093
Look, this Taggart guy was coerced.

08:18.094 --> 08:21.553
Even if he wasn't, he shot
a terrorist and a traitor.

08:21.554 --> 08:23.553
I'm sick of our soldiers being vilified

08:23.554 --> 08:26.884
for doing what it takes
to protect America.

08:34.304 --> 08:35.592
That is a good idea.

08:35.594 --> 08:36.883
Yeah, it is.

08:36.884 --> 08:38.133
A bit of a sweet tooth myself.

08:38.134 --> 08:39.592
Yeah. Me too.

08:39.594 --> 08:41.763
Yeah, well, there you go.

08:41.764 --> 08:43.383
So, hopefully...

08:43.384 --> 08:45.053
Hey.

08:45.054 --> 08:46.256
Joseph.

08:46.259 --> 08:48.223
Um, I asked Pastor
Adams over for a chat.

08:48.224 --> 08:49.223
Hi, Pastor. Good to see you.

08:49.224 --> 08:50.717
- Hello, Joe.
- Good to see you.

08:50.720 --> 08:52.513
Your wife made some
lovely coffee cake for us.

08:52.514 --> 08:53.673
Actually, it's store-bought.

08:53.674 --> 08:55.593
Oh, well, pardon me.

08:55.594 --> 08:58.053
You know, my cousin is a Ranger.

08:58.054 --> 08:59.383
Oh.

08:59.384 --> 09:01.513
Did I tell you that?

09:01.514 --> 09:04.263
No. No, I don't think you did.

09:04.264 --> 09:08.513
Four tours. Iraq, Afghanistan.

09:08.514 --> 09:09.883
He lost a lot of buddies.

09:09.884 --> 09:12.173
Well, that's tough. I feel for him.

09:12.174 --> 09:15.553
It can be a heavy burden,

09:15.554 --> 09:17.053
even when the cause is just.

09:17.054 --> 09:19.173
And it is just.

09:19.174 --> 09:21.633
What helped, what really grounded him

09:21.634 --> 09:23.673
was coming into the church.

09:23.674 --> 09:27.463
Not just the prayer, but
being with people, Joe.

09:27.464 --> 09:29.269
- Picnics, socials.
- Yeah.

09:29.272 --> 09:31.845
- You can't isolate yourself...
- Look, Pastor, I don't know what...

09:31.847 --> 09:36.053
What you've been told, but, uh...

09:36.054 --> 09:37.763
I'm fine.

09:37.764 --> 09:39.303
I'm fine.

09:39.304 --> 09:41.228
I'm... I'm glad to hear that, Joe.

09:41.231 --> 09:43.053
But we're the ones who
have asked you to do

09:43.054 --> 09:45.343
what must be done for your country.

09:45.344 --> 09:46.963
Let us help you.

09:46.964 --> 09:48.803
Pray with me, Joe.

09:48.804 --> 09:50.264
Okay.

09:53.884 --> 09:57.553
Jesus, we ask you in
the name of the Lord

09:57.554 --> 10:00.963
to bring peace to this
member of your flock.

10:00.964 --> 10:03.923
For you are the eternal shepherd.

10:03.924 --> 10:07.174
You bring us all under
your protective...

10:14.344 --> 10:16.173
I didn't know you were leaving.

10:16.174 --> 10:17.303
I could've helped.

10:17.304 --> 10:18.963
The Viking warrior

10:18.964 --> 10:21.383
looking after the widow
of his fallen comrade?

10:21.384 --> 10:23.514
It's an ancient tradition, right?

10:28.884 --> 10:32.803
You know, I never cheated on him.

10:32.804 --> 10:35.806
I know you all thought
I did... All y'all...

10:35.809 --> 10:37.439
But I never did.

10:40.094 --> 10:41.963
Not until he was dead.

10:41.964 --> 10:43.903
I'll take the blame for it, if you want.

10:43.906 --> 10:45.695
I'm... I'm sorry.

10:45.698 --> 10:47.884
It's... Look, it's not your fault.

10:49.634 --> 10:52.423
I just wish I were you.

10:52.424 --> 10:54.883
You are the lucky one.

10:54.884 --> 10:56.463
Why?

10:56.464 --> 10:59.304
Because you have nothing to lose.

11:09.974 --> 11:13.763
Judge Martinez and her
husband came to dinner.

11:13.764 --> 11:15.343
They asked after you.

11:15.344 --> 11:17.419
She said she'd love to
have you clerk for her.

11:17.422 --> 11:19.383
You were only a semester
away from your J.D.

11:19.384 --> 11:20.673
You could finish up.

11:20.674 --> 11:22.803
We've already talked about this.

11:22.804 --> 11:24.673
I'm not going back to law school.

11:24.674 --> 11:26.963
Did you know this SEAL?

11:26.964 --> 11:28.804
The one that confessed?

11:30.634 --> 11:31.554
No.

11:34.172 --> 11:36.723
I just hate to see you get
caught up in all of this.

11:36.724 --> 11:40.053
Look, what I'm doing
is just as righteous

11:40.054 --> 11:41.423
as your march at Selma.

11:41.424 --> 11:44.463
Son, that was the Civil Rights movement.

11:44.464 --> 11:45.745
There's no comparison.

11:45.748 --> 11:47.963
All right. Tell you
about a buddy of mine.

11:47.964 --> 11:49.843
Good ol' country boy.

11:49.844 --> 11:53.883
He died in my arms a week ago.

11:53.884 --> 11:56.803
And then I took out a guy trying
to save some kidnapped girls

11:56.804 --> 11:58.284
who only wanted to learn how to read.

12:00.514 --> 12:02.723
I killed someone.

12:02.724 --> 12:04.804
And I will do it again.

12:11.884 --> 12:13.963
Is there something you
want to talk about, son?

12:13.964 --> 12:15.634
You ever have any doubts?

12:17.634 --> 12:20.263
Hmm? During the movement.

12:20.264 --> 12:23.553
That what you were doing was right?

12:23.554 --> 12:25.763
Doubts... sure.

12:25.764 --> 12:27.923
There were some dark moments.

12:27.924 --> 12:31.053
Regrets? No.

12:31.054 --> 12:34.343
If I allowed injustice to
happen, then it was on me.

12:34.344 --> 12:36.513
I couldn't stand by and do nothing

12:36.514 --> 12:40.013
We were warriors, too, in our way.

12:40.014 --> 12:43.415
I would've died for
them... and they for me.

12:44.735 --> 12:48.423
Your roommate from Harvard,
uh, Charles Billington,

12:48.424 --> 12:50.923
he's still at the
embassy in Kabul, right?

12:50.924 --> 12:51.923
Yes.

12:51.924 --> 12:53.963
Good.

12:53.964 --> 12:56.463
'Cause I need a favor.

12:56.464 --> 12:59.013
The target is Nilofar Kazbekov...

12:59.014 --> 13:00.762
A Chechen rebel.

13:00.765 --> 13:03.763
Her husband was the dead Chechen
you brought back from Nigeria.

13:03.764 --> 13:06.673
He's a key lieutenant
of Akmal Barayev...

13:06.674 --> 13:08.673
Nilofar's brother, who
may have been leading

13:08.674 --> 13:11.173
the group that snatched
Rip from Boko Haram.

13:11.174 --> 13:12.763
Agency sources tell us

13:12.764 --> 13:16.173
Akmal here stays in close
touch with his sister.

13:16.174 --> 13:18.223
So we need to get her to get him.

13:18.224 --> 13:20.133
She lives in a villa in Panama

13:20.134 --> 13:23.633
paid for by charities
tied to terrorist groups.

13:23.634 --> 13:26.463
We estimate a three-to
five-man security detail.

13:26.464 --> 13:29.673
Going in low-vis, with
non-attributable gear.

13:29.674 --> 13:31.343
On Wednesday nights,

13:31.344 --> 13:34.133
the nanny usually takes
the daughter to the movies.

13:34.134 --> 13:37.264
That's when we'll grab the
target... when she's alone.

13:45.587 --> 13:49.084
_

14:11.449 --> 14:13.574
_

14:13.941 --> 14:15.339
_

14:15.342 --> 14:16.925
_

14:28.377 --> 14:29.337
One minute.

14:36.917 --> 14:38.507
Stand up.

14:41.547 --> 14:42.507
Go!

15:05.507 --> 15:06.627
Fatima.

15:07.189 --> 15:08.158
_

15:08.161 --> 15:09.598
_

15:10.486 --> 15:11.895
_

16:30.764 --> 16:33.117
_

16:59.258 --> 17:00.878
Go, go, go.

17:26.297 --> 17:27.896
Aaah!

17:29.337 --> 17:30.377
Put your head down.

17:30.378 --> 17:31.416
Bear, get the girl.

17:34.967 --> 17:37.416
Shh! Stop struggling! It's okay.

17:37.417 --> 17:38.706
Okay? Come with me.

17:38.707 --> 17:39.796
Got the drive.

17:39.797 --> 17:40.967
Good.

17:42.540 --> 17:44.917
Coming down with the target.

17:50.417 --> 17:52.166
Don't look. Don't look. Come on.

17:52.167 --> 17:53.207
It's okay.

17:54.797 --> 17:55.999
Oh!

17:56.002 --> 17:59.155
Touchdown. Prep for exfil. Break.

17:59.158 --> 18:02.166
Delta 1, Delta 4,
collapse inside the house.

18:02.167 --> 18:03.547
Delta 4, copy.

18:07.257 --> 18:08.707
- The girl's not supposed to be here.
- Yeah, no shit.

18:08.708 --> 18:09.966
You got the security hard drive?

18:09.967 --> 18:11.298
- Yeah. Buddha has it.
- All right.

18:11.300 --> 18:12.586
We got to go.

18:12.587 --> 18:14.046
We got lights at the neighbors'.

18:14.047 --> 18:15.586
- Let's go.
- Let's roll!

18:18.207 --> 18:19.837
Quiet. Quiet. Get in.

19:03.277 --> 19:07.116
_

19:07.285 --> 19:10.727
_

19:11.655 --> 19:13.614
You get the idea.

19:13.617 --> 19:16.974
With all of these new
recruits you're bringing us,

19:16.975 --> 19:19.434
gonna make a lot more of these teams.

19:19.435 --> 19:21.184
American ones.

19:21.185 --> 19:23.184
To bring on you what you bring on us.

19:23.185 --> 19:24.974
Michael, what you've done with the SEAL,

19:24.975 --> 19:27.304
all of these new recruits...
I was wrong to doubt you.

19:27.305 --> 19:29.684
Well, it's only the beginning.

19:29.685 --> 19:31.354
Right, Richard?

19:44.105 --> 19:46.434
Assalamu alaikum.

19:46.435 --> 19:48.644
This is unexpected. You
should've let me know.

19:48.645 --> 19:49.804
I could've made
arrangements for you to have

19:49.805 --> 19:51.514
a much safer passage to the facility.

19:51.515 --> 19:55.934
The prince wants me to cut
off my hand for stealing.

19:55.935 --> 19:57.854
He says I stole his trust.

19:57.855 --> 20:00.604
I didn't tell him it's
because you stole mine.

20:00.605 --> 20:03.015
Emir, your trust is sacred to me.

20:13.645 --> 20:14.605
Take him away.

20:18.698 --> 20:21.304
He's more valuable to
the cause than I thought.

20:21.305 --> 20:23.081
Have you seen the recruiting numbers?

20:23.084 --> 20:25.684
Do you want to watch
some of the training?

20:25.685 --> 20:28.805
We need to speak... In private.

20:43.855 --> 20:45.474
You are aware, are you not,

20:45.475 --> 20:47.474
that the power alliance with Boko Haram

20:47.475 --> 20:49.434
is the key to our expansion into Africa?

20:49.435 --> 20:50.474
Of course, but...

20:50.475 --> 20:51.804
So then why do you go

20:51.805 --> 20:54.104
and you kill their leader and his men?

20:54.105 --> 20:55.764
I made a tactical decision.

20:55.765 --> 20:57.313
It wasn't safe to come...

20:58.805 --> 21:02.212
I raised you up like
Lazarus out of the gutter!

21:02.215 --> 21:05.804
They all wanted me to kill
you, but I saw something in you.

21:05.805 --> 21:08.354
You were like a son to me.

21:08.355 --> 21:09.764
I will always be grateful.

21:09.765 --> 21:11.894
I may not be able to make this right.

21:11.895 --> 21:13.264
If we have to leave Chad,

21:13.265 --> 21:15.015
the prince is going to kill both of us.

21:17.805 --> 21:21.764
I remember the first day
I saw you killing a man

21:21.765 --> 21:23.854
for stealing your shoes.

21:23.855 --> 21:27.264
I knew then that you had
the will that my son lacked.

21:27.265 --> 21:31.604
I knew then that
such... Such fire in you

21:31.605 --> 21:35.104
would be great to join
with this intelligence...

21:35.105 --> 21:39.644
That you would be the
lion the cause needed.

21:39.645 --> 21:42.361
But I also saw this rage inside of you.

21:42.364 --> 21:45.864
Because of Omar, that rage
has endangered our cause.

21:48.225 --> 21:53.304
Everything I've done, I've done for you.

21:53.305 --> 21:57.184
Out of respect and gratitude.

21:57.185 --> 22:00.515
And we are doing everything we dreamed.

22:06.935 --> 22:11.014
I'll try to talk to Boko Haram...

22:11.015 --> 22:13.515
Come up with some sort of accommodation.

23:02.015 --> 23:03.372
Joseph.

23:18.765 --> 23:20.104
What are you thinking?

23:20.105 --> 23:22.014
Tell me right now.

23:23.225 --> 23:25.434
You don't want to know.

23:25.435 --> 23:27.065
No, I do.

23:33.225 --> 23:34.435
Okay.

23:39.065 --> 23:41.014
So...

23:41.015 --> 23:43.265
yesterday, I shot a woman.

23:46.435 --> 23:49.514
And I dragged a kid
out of a bed screaming.

23:49.515 --> 23:52.764
I dragged her down a flight of
stairs past three dead bodies,

23:52.765 --> 23:55.264
and then I threw her
in the back of a van.

23:55.265 --> 23:57.105
So...

24:02.475 --> 24:05.264
I...

24:05.265 --> 24:06.724
I-I shouldn't have told you.

24:06.725 --> 24:08.100
No, no, no, no.

24:08.101 --> 24:09.474
No.

24:09.475 --> 24:12.434
You should.

24:12.435 --> 24:15.765
Joseph, you do these things...

24:17.975 --> 24:19.855
...for a reason... To protect us.

24:23.435 --> 24:24.765
Okay?

24:26.685 --> 24:28.065
Okay?

24:30.975 --> 24:33.065
I shouldn't have told you.

24:37.265 --> 24:38.395
I'm sorry.

24:55.463 --> 24:59.039
When Sarah was a newborn,

24:59.040 --> 25:03.379
I used to take her out
and look at the stars.

25:03.380 --> 25:06.289
She couldn't understand, but I just...

25:06.292 --> 25:08.820
I wanted her to know that she
was part of something bigger.

25:11.300 --> 25:16.249
Something... beautiful and good.

25:16.250 --> 25:17.880
Something I was fighting for.

25:20.670 --> 25:22.419
Yeah.

25:22.420 --> 25:28.299
The night that... Lena
found her in the crib

25:28.300 --> 25:31.209
was the same night

25:31.210 --> 25:33.960
that I killed that kid in Fallujah.

25:35.800 --> 25:39.339
What, that kid that picked up the RPG?

25:39.340 --> 25:40.839
Any one of us would have shot that kid.

25:40.840 --> 25:42.131
- I would've shot him, man.
- No. No, listen.

25:42.133 --> 25:44.919
Sarah died to pay for
the life that I took.

25:44.920 --> 25:46.839
That... No, that's bullshit.

25:46.840 --> 25:48.539
No, Bear, that's bullshit.

25:48.540 --> 25:50.379
No, dude, these...
these... these things,

25:50.380 --> 25:51.959
they're... they're the mysteries, man.

25:51.960 --> 25:54.959
I mean, they're... There's no why.

26:00.000 --> 26:01.669
- Jackie.
- Oh.

26:01.670 --> 26:04.299
Ooh. You better get that.

26:04.300 --> 26:05.959
Hey.

26:05.960 --> 26:06.960
Yeah.

26:11.044 --> 26:12.254
I always blamed you.

26:14.694 --> 26:16.154
For what happened with Rip.

26:20.960 --> 26:22.380
I should've got him.

26:24.960 --> 26:26.960
I should've got him, brought him back.

26:41.750 --> 26:44.090
We all have regrets, Bear.

26:45.040 --> 26:46.920
After Buck...

26:52.015 --> 26:53.355
...I went to Tammi's.

26:56.920 --> 26:59.500
She said she didn't want to be alone.

27:03.210 --> 27:04.590
She said...

27:07.148 --> 27:09.000
... "I just need to be held."

27:12.420 --> 27:14.130
So I held her.

27:17.708 --> 27:19.077
Whoa, whoa! Hey!

27:19.080 --> 27:20.709
You hear what he said?!

27:20.710 --> 27:22.948
Hit me again, man. Please!

27:24.250 --> 27:27.669
This shit is way overdue!

27:27.670 --> 27:30.040
Take it to the beach!

27:33.000 --> 27:36.169
You selfish little shit. You
had this coming a long time.

27:36.170 --> 27:38.545
You're always trying to pin
your guilt on me, dude. Be a man.

27:38.547 --> 27:40.097
Own your own life.

28:03.332 --> 28:05.042
Okay, that's enough!

28:07.750 --> 28:09.500
Whoa!

28:14.090 --> 28:16.169
Are you done?!

28:16.170 --> 28:19.669
'Cause if you're not, I will go
and get Rip with Red Squadron!

28:20.710 --> 28:22.590
And I mean it!

28:26.590 --> 28:28.419
All right, girls, a quick refresher.

28:28.420 --> 28:30.459
Esther, which is the verb?

28:30.460 --> 28:31.749
"Return," teacher.

28:31.750 --> 28:32.749
Good!

28:32.750 --> 28:33.879
Catch.

28:35.040 --> 28:36.459
And the subject?

28:39.880 --> 28:40.960
Girls.

28:42.840 --> 28:44.340
Salaam-Alaikum.

29:10.000 --> 29:11.880
Please... sit.

29:16.906 --> 29:18.696
I know who you are.

29:20.880 --> 29:23.380
Emir Hatim al-Muttaqi.

29:25.090 --> 29:27.459
The Butcher of Khost.

29:27.460 --> 29:29.799
You know, you were famous
in Afghanistan, as well...

29:29.800 --> 29:31.629
The SEAL who hunted me.

29:31.630 --> 29:32.919
You'd be surprised how many times

29:32.920 --> 29:34.499
you really got close to catching me.

29:34.500 --> 29:37.589
Yeah, well, almost is not good enough.

29:37.590 --> 29:39.129
So, what happens from here?

29:39.130 --> 29:40.629
You are going to tell me

29:40.630 --> 29:43.169
how we stop your drones,
your surveillance...

29:43.170 --> 29:46.879
All the technology that
helps Americans beat us.

29:46.880 --> 29:49.459
And then after that, I'll
give him back to Boko Haram,

29:49.460 --> 29:52.419
and we'll add the $10
million plus the girls,

29:52.420 --> 29:55.669
and that should balance the scale.

29:55.670 --> 29:57.129
We'll see.

29:57.130 --> 30:00.299
Emir, he's more valuable to us.

30:00.300 --> 30:02.709
That's for me to decide.

30:02.710 --> 30:06.879
You Americans had the Jordanians
waterboard me 86 times,

30:06.880 --> 30:10.709
and I vowed every time
to kill 100 infidels

30:10.710 --> 30:12.589
every time they put a
towel on top of my face.

30:12.590 --> 30:14.539
Well, you better kill one
more, because I don't know...

30:14.540 --> 30:16.709
about the information that you want.

30:16.710 --> 30:19.169
At what altitude do the drones fly?

30:19.170 --> 30:21.792
- And what is their fuel capacity?
- I don't know.

30:21.795 --> 30:23.421
What about the frequencies
and how to jam them?

30:23.423 --> 30:24.829
I can't tell you anything
that I don't know.

30:24.831 --> 30:25.921
You have to give me something.

30:25.923 --> 30:28.587
I've been out for two years.
It's all changed by now.

30:39.300 --> 30:41.879
Waterboarding didn't work with me.

30:41.880 --> 30:43.590
It won't work with you.

30:58.739 --> 31:00.569
How can we jam the frequencies?

31:01.750 --> 31:04.839
You don't get it, do you?

31:04.840 --> 31:06.209
Kill her.

31:06.210 --> 31:07.419
Kill me.

31:07.420 --> 31:11.169
Kill everybody in that room.

31:11.170 --> 31:13.959
'Cause America's coming for me.

31:13.960 --> 31:16.959
And they're coming for you.

31:16.960 --> 31:19.499
And they won't stop until they kill you

31:19.500 --> 31:21.499
and every single person that you know.

31:21.502 --> 31:26.961
Now, your best option is
to trade me and those girls

31:26.964 --> 31:30.589
for 20 of your imprisoned
jihadist brothers.

31:30.590 --> 31:32.670
At least you get
something out of the deal.

31:35.540 --> 31:37.424
Give your boy to Boko Haram.

31:37.427 --> 31:39.442
That would square things with them.

31:43.630 --> 31:47.709
Emir, he's just stalling,
trying to save his own skin.

31:47.710 --> 31:49.459
Every day, we grow stronger.

31:49.460 --> 31:51.460
Shh, shh. Of course.

31:56.380 --> 31:58.540
We shall continue this later.

32:16.143 --> 32:19.208
All the Afghan police
prisoner interviews in Khost

32:19.210 --> 32:22.290
and prisoner dispensations
from the day you asked for,

32:22.293 --> 32:24.169
Plus a day on either side.

32:24.170 --> 32:25.789
I don't even want to have to tell you

32:25.790 --> 32:27.590
- what it took to get this.
- Thank you.

32:27.593 --> 32:30.289
In politics, sometimes,
ignorance is power.

32:30.290 --> 32:32.209
Yeah, well, I'm not in politics.

32:32.210 --> 32:34.919
Everyone's in politics.

32:34.922 --> 32:36.827
Think hard about what you're doing.

32:36.830 --> 32:38.879
This could be one of
those moments in your life

32:38.882 --> 32:41.757
where it could go one way or the other.

32:44.524 --> 32:45.364
Son.

32:46.731 --> 32:47.891
Be careful.

32:53.259 --> 32:55.429
I don't think it really
makes a difference

32:55.432 --> 32:58.459
whether or not you're
saying, like, gelato, gelati.

32:58.460 --> 32:59.749
It's kind of the same thing.

32:59.750 --> 33:00.855
Hey.

33:00.856 --> 33:01.959
Oh, thanks.

33:01.960 --> 33:04.919
If you're here for the
gelato, this place sucks.

33:04.920 --> 33:08.169
I actually came to give you
an apology about the video

33:08.170 --> 33:12.919
that you saw of... of,
um... me and Buck's widow.

33:12.920 --> 33:14.459
Wow.

33:14.460 --> 33:17.249
Alex.

33:17.250 --> 33:19.589
I thought you were coming
about the video in the news...

33:19.590 --> 33:21.499
Of the SEAL.

33:21.500 --> 33:23.669
But I guess you think
that having sex is worse

33:23.670 --> 33:25.710
than killing an unarmed kid.

33:29.000 --> 33:31.419
It's not that big of a deal.

33:31.420 --> 33:33.209
Tammi probably needed it.

33:33.210 --> 33:35.419
People hook up.

33:35.420 --> 33:37.499
What do you mean, she...

33:37.500 --> 33:39.379
Wait, are you... Are you having...

33:39.380 --> 33:40.829
Is it true about the SEAL?

33:40.830 --> 33:42.445
I can't tell you that.

33:42.448 --> 33:43.539
Fine.

33:43.540 --> 33:44.960
I'm really busy here.

33:50.090 --> 33:51.880
Have a good one.

33:56.880 --> 33:59.209
The stuff that SEAL says,
it happens all the time...

33:59.210 --> 34:01.209
On both sides.

34:01.210 --> 34:02.789
It always has. It always will.

34:02.790 --> 34:05.249
But nobody wants to know it.

34:05.250 --> 34:07.039
They just want us to go out there

34:07.040 --> 34:08.958
and keep the bad guys out of our suburbs

34:08.960 --> 34:10.879
and the truth off TV.

34:10.880 --> 34:14.668
Well, maybe we're making more
bad guys than we're killing.

34:14.670 --> 34:16.129
It's bad math.

34:16.130 --> 34:18.329
I can't think about that.

34:18.330 --> 34:20.040
So I don't.

34:21.630 --> 34:23.829
Doubt creates hesitation.
Hesitation gets you killed.

34:23.830 --> 34:26.458
So...

34:26.460 --> 34:27.857
I can't.

34:31.090 --> 34:33.089
I did make one mistake.

34:33.090 --> 34:35.330
Which mistake are we talking about?

34:36.630 --> 34:38.629
I'm a warrior.

34:38.630 --> 34:40.629
It's who I am.

34:40.630 --> 34:42.498
It's my path.

34:42.500 --> 34:45.879
I have to live like I'm already dead.

34:45.880 --> 34:49.748
I think it would be a good idea if...

34:49.750 --> 34:51.670
you weren't around anymore.

34:55.670 --> 34:56.750
Okay.

34:58.670 --> 35:00.630
But, then, you came to see me.

35:27.880 --> 35:29.589
Lena. What a surprise.

35:29.590 --> 35:30.380
Can I come in?

35:30.381 --> 35:31.169
Sure.

35:31.170 --> 35:33.209
Thought you were another
vulture at the door.

35:33.210 --> 35:35.129
Have you seen the video
of your ex-husband?

35:35.130 --> 35:38.999
Is he a war hero or a war criminal?

35:40.710 --> 35:42.711
I should've called.

35:43.960 --> 35:46.499
Yeah, it's been a while, Lena.

35:46.500 --> 35:48.249
I... you know, everything
that's going on,

35:48.250 --> 35:51.379
I wanted to check in on
you, make sure you're okay.

35:51.380 --> 35:54.379
Yeah, well, I've got
Dylan and his daddy.

35:54.380 --> 35:55.879
That's all I need.

35:55.880 --> 35:57.589
He's beautiful.

35:57.590 --> 35:59.539
You want to hold him?

35:59.540 --> 36:01.919
Sure.

36:01.920 --> 36:04.539
Doesn't bite.

36:04.540 --> 36:06.959
Oh.

36:06.960 --> 36:09.919
So, you trying again? You and Joe?

36:09.920 --> 36:11.589
Hopefully.

36:13.750 --> 36:14.879
Wow.

36:14.880 --> 36:17.253
He's so big.

36:19.000 --> 36:20.499
Ohhh.

36:20.500 --> 36:22.170
So, why are you really here, Lena?

36:23.330 --> 36:24.539
Um...

36:24.540 --> 36:26.089
Let me guess...

36:26.090 --> 36:30.379
Joe's torn up inside, shutting you out.

36:30.380 --> 36:32.496
Like he's got a thousand
ghosts in his head.

36:34.460 --> 36:38.459
Think that life you're
in, you think it's normal.

36:38.460 --> 36:39.540
It's not.

36:41.590 --> 36:44.879
I just...

36:44.880 --> 36:47.209
I don't know what to do.

36:47.210 --> 36:49.249
I don't know how to help him.

36:49.250 --> 36:53.039
Their world, it's all about death.

36:53.040 --> 36:55.129
If you want this, you want life...

36:56.336 --> 36:57.539
Aww.

36:57.540 --> 36:59.419
...get out now while you still can.

37:01.920 --> 37:03.960
There's a smile

37:10.692 --> 37:12.481
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

37:18.715 --> 37:23.414
In that... video...

37:23.415 --> 37:25.585
you spoke about your brothers.

37:26.740 --> 37:29.859
Other SEALs?

37:29.860 --> 37:31.149
Tell me about them.

37:31.150 --> 37:32.779
Not much to tell, really.

37:32.780 --> 37:33.989
Start with their names.

37:37.150 --> 37:40.279
There was this one guy.

37:40.280 --> 37:42.319
The name was Bear.

37:42.320 --> 37:45.779
Ooh! He must be really big.

37:45.780 --> 37:48.530
Yeah, but we called him
that because he, uh...

37:50.950 --> 37:53.739
...he ran bare-ass naked down a...

37:53.740 --> 37:56.649
...a boardwalk

37:56.650 --> 38:02.360
while we were doing this,
um, this thing... Green Team.

38:04.700 --> 38:07.149
We all had nicknames.

38:07.150 --> 38:09.239
Me.

38:09.240 --> 38:11.409
Buddha.

38:12.740 --> 38:15.949
Uh, Fishbait.

38:15.950 --> 38:19.989
Yeah, we do the same in Nigeria.

38:19.990 --> 38:22.820
It is a sign of affection.

38:26.820 --> 38:30.650
Everybody except for this guy, Caulder.

38:32.700 --> 38:34.410
He's a bit of a surfer...

38:36.950 --> 38:38.650
But he was our surfer...

38:41.150 --> 38:43.409
They were really good guys.

38:43.410 --> 38:46.070
They were your family.

38:47.610 --> 38:48.820
Yeah.

38:52.240 --> 38:54.610
They were my only family.

39:00.280 --> 39:03.150
You know, the stuff
I said on that video...

39:06.700 --> 39:08.070
...it was true.

39:10.320 --> 39:12.819
All of it was true.

39:12.820 --> 39:14.240
I shot his brother...

39:16.780 --> 39:20.610
...while his hands
were raised in the air.

39:27.150 --> 39:28.740
Why?

39:32.150 --> 39:35.909
He was just a period...

39:35.910 --> 39:38.780
at the end of a 60-word sentence.

39:40.360 --> 39:43.610
I don't even remember
what he looked like.

39:47.610 --> 39:48.909
Hold on. That could be him.

39:48.910 --> 39:50.109
Yeah, freeze it.

39:50.110 --> 39:52.569
He looks familiar.

39:52.570 --> 39:54.773
It's hard to understand
him. His Pashto sucks.

39:54.776 --> 39:56.240
He says he's Arab, but
his Arabic sucks, too.

39:56.241 --> 39:57.489
What's he saying? What's he saying?

39:57.490 --> 39:58.859
He's saying that a U.S. soldier

39:58.860 --> 40:00.895
killed a prisoner in cold blood

40:00.898 --> 40:02.358
after he surrendered.

40:03.780 --> 40:05.610
He was American.

40:09.570 --> 40:10.909
Where did you get this?

40:10.910 --> 40:12.409
The less any of you know

40:12.410 --> 40:13.949
about where this came from, the better.

40:13.950 --> 40:15.819
Okay, anybody know what
happened to this guy?

40:15.820 --> 40:18.649
All these guys in these tapes
were interrogated and released.

40:18.650 --> 40:22.279
All right, so besides you guys and Rip,

40:22.280 --> 40:24.409
he's the only one who
knows what happened, right?

40:24.410 --> 40:26.359
This guy has Rip or knows who has him.

40:26.360 --> 40:27.989
It's the raghead driver.

40:27.990 --> 40:29.359
Wait, what?

40:29.360 --> 40:30.779
Rip was gonna kill him, too.

40:30.780 --> 40:31.989
So why didn't he?

40:31.990 --> 40:33.359
Because I stopped him.

40:33.360 --> 40:34.340
Because I stopped him.

40:34.341 --> 40:35.319
All right.

40:35.320 --> 40:37.609
All right, so... So
maybe this guy's American.

40:37.610 --> 40:38.989
All right, think about it. All right?

40:38.990 --> 40:40.989
He's not from where he says he's from.

40:40.990 --> 40:43.909
It makes sense... Two
guys fighting together.

40:43.910 --> 40:45.319
Well, if he's American,

40:45.320 --> 40:46.909
then maybe Intel could I.D. him, right?

40:46.910 --> 40:48.450
- Could get us get closer to Rip.
- No, hold on.

40:48.451 --> 40:50.529
We can't send it to Intel,
because then they'll know

40:50.530 --> 40:52.109
what Rip said in the video is true.

40:52.110 --> 40:53.949
Then it would be the word of a terrorist

40:53.950 --> 40:55.109
against us, right?

40:55.110 --> 40:57.069
Maybe yes, maybe not, but, I mean,

40:57.070 --> 40:58.739
it's gonna take them
forever to sort it out.

40:58.740 --> 41:00.449
We'll be sidelined.

41:00.450 --> 41:02.569
Could take us months to
get back out, if ever.

41:02.570 --> 41:04.489
But, guys, this is
bigger than Rip. Right?

41:04.490 --> 41:07.699
It's bigger than the girls,
and it's bigger than us.

41:07.700 --> 41:10.279
Now, this guy had Rip
in front of the same flag

41:10.280 --> 41:12.239
as the Tanzanian Embassy bombing.

41:12.240 --> 41:13.700
All right, this guy...

41:16.318 --> 41:18.238
...he wants to be the
next Osama Bin Laden.

41:34.240 --> 41:35.740
Meet your new cellmate.

41:38.110 --> 41:40.450
You were right... Boko
Haram does want him.

41:41.950 --> 41:43.530
My brother died for you.

41:48.450 --> 41:51.200
Your brother was more loyal than you.

41:55.450 --> 41:57.449
Akmal, everything we've worked for...

41:57.450 --> 41:58.820
Don't you waste it.

42:18.780 --> 42:20.280
Hello.
