<i>It will be a dismal day.</i>

01:12:59.918 --> 01:13:01.961
<i>They'll be crying for their mummies.</i>

01:13:01.962 --> 01:13:04.297

01:13:36.663 --> 01:13:38.873
<i>From the chains of gravity.</i>

01:13:38.874 --> 01:13:40.958
<i>Then we'll hoist up the sail.</i>

01:13:40.959 --> 01:13:43.086
