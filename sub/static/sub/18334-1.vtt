00:30.431 --> 00:32.433
[suspenseful music]

00:43.211 --> 00:44.412
[Boy 1]
[nervously] Is this it?

00:44.445 --> 00:48.182
[Boy 2]
Yeah. See?

00:48.216 --> 00:50.751
It has to be. C'mon.

00:55.156 --> 00:56.457
Are you coming?

00:56.490 --> 00:57.825
[Boy 1]
I'm thinking.

00:57.858 --> 01:00.561
[Boy 2]
Now's not the time.

01:00.594 --> 01:03.431
[Boy 1]
It's very creepy in there.

01:03.464 --> 01:05.166
Are you sure it's in there?

01:05.199 --> 01:07.201
[Boy 2]
Positive. Let's go.

01:12.406 --> 01:14.242
[Boy 1]
But, but what about...

01:14.275 --> 01:16.277
[Boy 2]
Shhh!

01:26.520 --> 01:28.522
[door creaking]

01:40.268 --> 01:42.536
Come on.

01:48.409 --> 01:50.378
[camera flash]

01:50.411 --> 01:52.380
[Both]
WHAAAAHH!

01:52.413 --> 01:54.415
[ominous music]

02:13.767 --> 02:15.769
[suspenseful music]

[explosion]

02:44.365 --> 02:47.635
[alarm wailing]

02:47.668 --> 02:49.937
[screeching tires]

03:08.856 --> 03:10.658
[Police Chief]
"Kind regards..."

03:10.691 --> 03:13.494
...to Whitby's finest.

03:13.527 --> 03:15.863
Your partner in crime prevention,

03:18.332 --> 03:20.568
"Annabelle."

03:22.570 --> 03:25.939
[Burt] [distant voice echoing]
Annabelle... Annabelle...

03:25.973 --> 03:27.841
Come in, Annabelle...

03:27.875 --> 03:31.379
[Annabelle] Dad, sorry, could you not?
I was in the middle of

03:31.412 --> 03:34.515
writing a scene. Smoke. Fire.
Explosions. The whole deal.

03:34.548 --> 03:35.516
[Burt]
Oh, yeah?

03:35.549 --> 03:36.917
[Annabelle]
Yeah.

03:36.950 --> 03:39.687
[Burt] How's the story
coming along, anyway?

03:39.720 --> 03:43.657
[Annabelle] Not great.
I'm just not inspired.

03:43.691 --> 03:46.294
[Burt] Inspiration will come.
And you'll have plenty of time

03:46.327 --> 03:48.396
to write when you get to the
island. You know everybody's

03:48.429 --> 03:52.032
got a story they want to tell or
some mystery they want solved.

03:52.065 --> 03:54.402
But you can't rush inspiration.

03:54.435 --> 03:56.003
[Annabelle]
I know, I know.

03:56.036 --> 03:59.440
[Meredith] I cannot wait to see Gayle.
What's it been now.

03:59.473 --> 04:01.575
It's been 15 years, probably?
I mean, Maddi was an infant,

04:01.609 --> 04:04.378
Jake almost two?

04:04.412 --> 04:06.614
I'm really glad that we're
gonna all be here together.

04:06.647 --> 04:08.015
Aren't you, Annabelle?

04:08.048 --> 04:10.017
[Annabelle]
Mmmhmm.

04:10.050 --> 04:12.720
[Burt] You're gonna love this house,
AnnaBug. It's a big old house,

04:12.753 --> 04:15.623
it's 200 years old. It's got a
widow's walk and everything.

04:17.625 --> 04:19.627
[Annabelle]
Cool.

04:19.660 --> 04:23.764
[Meredith] I bet it has an interesting
history. Inspirational, perhaps?

04:25.833 --> 04:28.035
[Burt]
Hey, where you going?

04:28.068 --> 04:31.472
[Annabelle] Well, I might not be able
to rush inspiration, but nothing

04:31.505 --> 04:33.374
can stop me from looking for it.

04:33.407 --> 04:36.043
[Burt] That's actually the
definition of rushing it.

04:36.076 --> 04:38.045
[Meredith laughing]

04:38.078 --> 04:39.713
Her mind never stops.

04:39.747 --> 04:41.515
[Meredith]
Just like her Daddy's.

04:43.817 --> 04:45.819
[orchestra playing]

04:48.956 --> 04:51.859
[Annabelle V.O.] My fingers
have always itched to write.

04:51.892 --> 04:55.329
But inspiration is my nemesis.

04:55.363 --> 04:59.833
It can be hard to find, no
matter how hard I look for it.

05:03.737 --> 05:06.907
The perfect inspiration
for a future character!

05:06.940 --> 05:11.078
He looks out of place, yet
somehow completely comfortable.

05:13.847 --> 05:15.916
[picture click]

05:15.949 --> 05:18.886
This Old Salt is oblivious
that one day he might become

05:18.919 --> 05:21.622
a character brought to life
in a bestselling novel,

05:21.655 --> 05:25.526
written by the greatest mystery
writer nobody's ever heard of.

05:25.559 --> 05:28.896
At least not yet, anyway.

05:28.929 --> 05:31.365
[Old Salt]
BOO!

05:33.501 --> 05:35.503
[upbeat music]

06:51.745 --> 06:54.014
[Meredith]
Wow, would you look at that.

06:54.047 --> 06:57.785
[Burt]
How is that for inspiration?

06:57.818 --> 06:59.820
[Annabelle]
Not bad at all.

07:03.223 --> 07:07.127
[mysterious music]

07:10.798 --> 07:13.934
[Meredith]
Annabelle, are you coming?

07:13.967 --> 07:17.437
[Annabelle] Uhm. Yeah.
Just gimme one second.

07:22.109 --> 07:25.579
[Annabelle V.O.] It's your imagination,
Annabelle. Writer's adrenaline,

07:25.613 --> 07:27.615
that's all.

07:41.161 --> 07:45.733
Rule number one: Never ignore
the silent call of intrigue.

07:51.672 --> 07:53.674
[picture click]

08:00.614 --> 08:03.116
What's your story?

08:03.150 --> 08:05.152
[picture clicks]

08:15.228 --> 08:16.697
Talk to me.

08:22.135 --> 08:24.137
[sharp inhale]

08:37.751 --> 08:40.153
This looks like a kid's handwriting.

08:56.870 --> 08:59.673
[Meredith] Annabelle, you're room
is at the top of the stairs!

09:08.315 --> 09:10.083
[Annabelle V.O.] Okay, you've been here
less than five minutes, Annabelle,

09:10.117 --> 09:12.552
and you are freaking yourself out.

09:14.955 --> 09:19.326
See, nothing to worry about.
Nice and bright.

09:22.996 --> 09:26.199
Not scary at all, just a little dark.

09:29.670 --> 09:32.806
Okay, fine, it's maybe a little scary...

09:36.877 --> 09:39.880
Get real, Annabelle, you're
a wannabe mystery writer.

09:44.885 --> 09:46.887
[door creaking]

10:02.269 --> 10:04.772
It's clean.

10:06.840 --> 10:09.977
Nice desk to write at.

10:10.010 --> 10:13.013
Plenty of space to let my mind run wild.

10:17.117 --> 10:19.653
And inspiration?

10:25.292 --> 10:27.327
It will find me.

10:40.140 --> 10:41.909
[Annabelle]
Hey.

10:41.942 --> 10:43.944
[Both]
Hey!

10:43.977 --> 10:46.079
[Burt] Hey, what do you think?
Do you call this...

10:46.113 --> 10:49.783
[Annabelle]
Inspiration? Absolutely.

10:49.817 --> 10:51.384
[Burt] So what've you
got there, AnnaBug?

10:51.418 --> 10:54.187
[Annabelle] Oh, uhm, just
something I found downstairs.

10:54.221 --> 10:56.857
[Meredith]
Anything good?

10:56.890 --> 10:59.259
[Annabelle]
I'm not sure yet.

10:59.292 --> 11:02.462
[Meredith] Hey, you know what I saw
out back? An old bike,

11:02.495 --> 11:05.132
so you'll have a way to
get around the island.

11:05.165 --> 11:09.002
[Annabelle] A bike? You
want me to ride a bike?

11:09.036 --> 11:10.303
She wants me to ride a bike?

11:10.337 --> 11:12.405
[Burt]
When in Nantucket...

11:12.439 --> 11:13.807
[Meredith] Yeah, just throw on one of
those cute little helmets and it will

11:13.841 --> 11:14.908
get you all over town.

11:14.942 --> 11:16.476
[Annabelle]
A helmet, too?

11:16.509 --> 11:20.247
[Meredith] Just consider it
part of the Nantucket charm.

11:20.280 --> 11:22.282
[Annabelle]
Awesome.

11:30.357 --> 11:32.359
[creaking]

11:34.361 --> 11:36.363
[mysterious music]

11:53.213 --> 11:55.448
Hmm.

11:55.482 --> 11:57.450
[clearing throat]

11:57.484 --> 11:59.486
[sighs]

12:01.889 --> 12:04.758
C'mon inspiration, where you at?

12:12.565 --> 12:15.769
[Annabelle V.O.]
Let's see what you got for me.

12:17.570 --> 12:19.773
[violin music]

12:33.286 --> 12:36.456
"Looked around the Whaling Museum
today... I felt like the...

12:36.489 --> 12:39.259
...key should be here, not even
sure where I should look."

12:39.292 --> 12:43.430
"What does it even look like?
Is this the key?"

12:43.463 --> 12:45.465
What does that mean?

12:55.976 --> 12:59.446
[Annabelle] I mean that whale skeleton
was ginormous. Only a baby and

12:59.479 --> 13:04.417
46 feet long? I mean that's
crazy, right! Oh, and how about

13:04.451 --> 13:07.154
those sailors that sang for a
year to keep from going insane

13:07.187 --> 13:13.360
when they were lost at sea.
Now there's a story.

13:13.393 --> 13:15.228
What?

13:15.262 --> 13:17.497
[Burt] Nothing, nothing. I'm
just glad you're not too old to

13:17.530 --> 13:21.068
hang out with your old man.
I was afraid you'd get bored.

13:21.101 --> 13:24.071
[Annabelle] Dad, stop it.
You're my sidekick. I could

13:24.104 --> 13:26.173
never get bored with you.

13:26.206 --> 13:31.311
[Meredith] There you are! Come on.
Let's leave Annabelle on her own

13:31.344 --> 13:33.847
to explore the island
a little bit. Come on.

13:33.881 --> 13:34.915
[Annabelle]
Bye guys.

13:34.948 --> 13:36.950
[Burt]
Go have some fun.

13:36.984 --> 13:38.986
[Annabelle]
Hmmm.

13:40.988 --> 13:42.990
[upbeat music]

13:54.567 --> 13:56.136
[Jake]
It was a zoning violation.

13:56.169 --> 13:59.006
[Maddi] Your life's a
zoning violation! AHH!

14:01.008 --> 14:03.343
AHH! That is it!

14:06.013 --> 14:08.015
Ughhhh...

14:16.589 --> 14:20.460
[Maddi] Hand me that synthetic
polymer lathe, would you?

14:20.493 --> 14:27.334
[Annabelle] That? Uhm, some people
would just call it a shovel, but...

14:27.367 --> 14:29.369
[Maddi]
Thanks.

14:34.307 --> 14:38.278
[Annabelle]
So, what happened?

14:38.311 --> 14:42.682
[Maddi] It was the Sankaty Lighthouse,
located at 41.2844 degrees north

14:42.715 --> 14:45.919
latitude and 69.966 degrees,
west longitude, and 70 feet

14:45.953 --> 14:50.223
or 21.34 meters in height. My
version was precisely one fifth

14:50.257 --> 14:56.196
in scale, standing at a height
14 feet or 4.29 meters.

14:56.229 --> 14:58.265
I have a photographic memory.

14:58.298 --> 15:00.300
[Annabelle]
Wow.

15:02.269 --> 15:04.571
Wait, are you Maddi?

15:04.604 --> 15:06.706
[Maddi]
Yeah.

15:06.739 --> 15:08.541
[Annabelle] So, that must mean
that was just your brother Jake.

15:08.575 --> 15:10.210
[Maddi]
Yes, how'd you know?

15:10.243 --> 15:11.444
[Annabelle] My Mom was talking about...

15:11.478 --> 15:13.013
[Jake]
Let's go! We're late.

15:13.046 --> 15:16.549
[Maddi] We're always late!
See you around!

15:16.583 --> 15:19.386
[Annabelle]
Yeah, I hope so.

15:19.419 --> 15:21.421
[whirring]

15:33.333 --> 15:35.468
[Annabelle V.O.] It's looking like
Nantucket can be the perfect setting

15:35.502 --> 15:37.504
for a mystery.

15:39.506 --> 15:41.508
[mysterious music]

15:44.411 --> 15:46.413
[Female Voice]
[whisper] Annabelle...

15:57.190 --> 15:59.192
[whisper] Annabelle...

16:02.795 --> 16:04.998
[ominous music]

16:10.403 --> 16:12.405
[Annabelle]
Hello?

16:18.778 --> 16:21.748
[mumbling] You're freaking
yourself out, as usual.

16:27.654 --> 16:29.489
[loud shriek]

16:32.692 --> 16:35.795
[mumbling] It's just in your
head, it's just in your head...

16:35.828 --> 16:38.031
Ohhh!

16:42.835 --> 16:44.804
[Female Voice]
[whisper] Annabelle...

16:44.837 --> 16:47.040
[sharp inhale]

16:52.612 --> 16:56.783
[Annabelle V.O.] If Dad's playing a
joke on me, it's only mildly funny.

17:01.454 --> 17:02.422
[Annabelle]
[screaming] Whaaa!

17:02.455 --> 17:05.092
Mom!

17:05.125 --> 17:06.726
[Meredith] Annabelle! What in
the world, what are you doing?

17:06.759 --> 17:08.828
[Annabelle] I'm freaking myself
out, that's what's going on.

17:08.861 --> 17:11.298
[Meredith] Well you're freaking me out.
I found your phone on the ground.

17:11.330 --> 17:12.531
You okay?

17:12.565 --> 17:14.067
[Annabelle]
Do I look okay?

17:14.101 --> 17:15.667
[Meredith]
Well... not really...

17:15.702 --> 17:17.436
[Annabelle] Don't answer that,
just go back to bed, okay?

17:17.470 --> 17:18.771
[Meredith]
You go to bed, too.

17:18.805 --> 17:20.673
[Annabelle]
Wait why are you in jeans?

17:20.707 --> 17:22.342
[Meredith] I can't sleep. All right?
I'm baking. Yes... Muffins.

17:22.375 --> 17:23.542
[Annabelle] You're baking?
What kind of muffins?

17:23.576 --> 17:25.311
[Meredith]
Muffins, your favorite.

17:28.781 --> 17:30.417
[sighing]

17:32.319 --> 17:34.321
[mysterious music]

18:17.797 --> 18:20.267
[birds chirping]

18:33.313 --> 18:35.182
[Burt]
There you go.

18:35.215 --> 18:37.184
[Meredith] Ah, thank you. I don't
know why we haven't come here

18:37.217 --> 18:39.652
since our honeymoon.
What were we thinking?

18:39.686 --> 18:41.654
[Burt]
We obviously weren't.

18:41.688 --> 18:45.792
[Meredith] What do you think was
going on with Annabelle last night?

18:47.794 --> 18:51.264
[Annabelle]
Look, I know I saw something.

18:51.298 --> 18:54.267
[Meredith] You know that stress
can bring on crazy things and

18:54.301 --> 18:55.702
everything that's going on.

18:55.735 --> 18:57.904
[Annabelle] Mom, I'm not
stressed, I don't...

18:57.937 --> 18:59.939
[Meredith]
Honey.

18:59.972 --> 19:03.543
[Annabelle] It's a habit.
Look, I know that there's

19:03.576 --> 19:07.647
a story here. I just don't
know where to start.

19:07.680 --> 19:10.217
[Burt] You know the old woman who
owns this house, said that nobody had

19:10.250 --> 19:12.819
lived in it for years.
And there's a story behind

19:12.852 --> 19:17.657
everything on this island. Even
this house could have a story

19:17.690 --> 19:25.298
behind it. Sometimes the
history... is the mystery.

19:25.332 --> 19:27.367
[Annabelle]
The history is the mystery?

19:27.400 --> 19:29.469
[Burt]
You should start here.

19:36.576 --> 19:38.578
[piano music]

19:44.617 --> 19:46.619
[picture click]

20:12.345 --> 20:14.547
[Maddi] The ten classes are each
divided into ten divisions, and each

20:14.581 --> 20:17.584
division into ten sections,
giving ten main classes

20:17.617 --> 20:20.487
100 divisions and
1000 possible sections....

20:20.520 --> 20:22.689
You know there are one million
possible classifications

20:22.722 --> 20:25.625
available, but they can't spare
a single one for graphic novels

20:25.658 --> 20:27.760
in the time honored
tradition of Japanese Manga!

20:27.794 --> 20:29.862
[Annabelle]
Excuse me. Sorry.

20:29.896 --> 20:31.030
[Maddi] You're the girl
from the beach, the one who

20:31.063 --> 20:33.300
somehow knew my name.

20:33.333 --> 20:36.836
[Annabelle] Yeah. Our parents are
friends. They told me that your family

20:36.869 --> 20:38.771
was also visiting the island,
and that you were some

20:38.805 --> 20:42.375
math whiz. I took a
chance and you were you

20:42.409 --> 20:43.976
and I was right, thank gosh.

20:44.010 --> 20:46.846
[Maddi]
So, you're Annabelle?

20:46.879 --> 20:48.481
[Annabelle]
I am.

20:48.515 --> 20:51.518
[Maddi] My parents told
me you'd be here, too.

20:51.551 --> 20:55.054
[Annabelle] Well, now that we've
been officially introduced,

20:55.087 --> 20:57.657
I need your help.

21:00.360 --> 21:03.563
So let me get this straight.
You actually think that

21:03.596 --> 21:05.432
I might've seen something?

21:05.465 --> 21:06.966
[Maddi] Well, you could have seen
an apparition, or simply had

21:06.999 --> 21:09.068
a false awakening.

21:09.101 --> 21:10.703
[Annabelle] Okay. I don't know what
either of those mean, but you're smart,

21:10.737 --> 21:12.939
so I'm listening.

21:12.972 --> 21:14.741
[Maddi] So, you really think you're
going to go back to the house

21:14.774 --> 21:16.976
of yours? It sounds unstable.

21:17.009 --> 21:18.678
[Annabelle]
It could be worse.

21:18.711 --> 21:20.580
[Maddi]
Truth.

21:20.613 --> 21:22.515
Okay, well... I think we've got
all the information we can out

21:22.549 --> 21:23.816
of these books.

21:23.850 --> 21:26.419
[Annabelle]
They were absolutely no help.

21:34.060 --> 21:39.899
[Maddi]
I have an idea.

21:39.932 --> 21:43.470
[Annabelle] Wait. The tour starts
at the cemetery. I think there's a

21:43.503 --> 21:45.638
picture of it in this book.

21:45.672 --> 21:51.444
Prospect Hill Cemetery.
Let's meet there at sundown.

21:51.478 --> 21:54.481
Maybe we'll get some answers.

21:58.851 --> 22:00.953
[mysterious music]

22:13.132 --> 22:15.134
[Jake] Remind me again why I'm
being forced to participate

22:15.167 --> 22:16.536
in this witch hunt.

22:16.569 --> 22:17.637
[Maddi]
Ghost investigation.

22:17.670 --> 22:19.506
[Jake]
Same thing.

22:19.539 --> 22:21.140
[Maddi] No, not even close. And
you're here to keep us safe.

22:21.173 --> 22:25.878
[Jake] We're in Nantucket. What
do you think's gonna happen?

22:25.912 --> 22:27.647
[Annabelle]
Hi, I'm Annabelle.

22:27.680 --> 22:29.516
[Jake]
Guess I'm here to keep you safe.

22:29.549 --> 22:31.451
[Annabelle]
Excuse me?

22:31.484 --> 22:32.885
[Maddi]
Don't worry, he's harmless.

22:32.919 --> 22:35.688
[Annabelle]
Oh, okay.

22:35.722 --> 22:37.957
[Jake]
Nice ride.

22:37.990 --> 22:40.860
[Silas] All right everybody.
Settle down.

22:40.893 --> 22:47.033
Now, as you know, my reputation
proceeds me. I am in fact...

22:47.066 --> 22:51.971
The Silas Grimm...
And this is the one and only

22:52.004 --> 22:57.710
Silas Grimm Authentic Ghost Walk Tour...

22:57.744 --> 22:59.546
You may applaud.

22:59.579 --> 23:01.714
[applause]

23:01.748 --> 23:05.752
...and I have seen and heard it
all, people. And just barely

23:05.785 --> 23:10.923
lived to tell the tales. Take a
look around, my dears.

23:10.957 --> 23:18.531
The history of Nantucket and
all of its ghosts are here.

23:18.565 --> 23:25.004
Okay, come follow me. Off we
go into the spirit world.

23:25.037 --> 23:27.540
[Jake]
What are we even doing here?

23:29.842 --> 23:35.548
[Silas] Now listen closely to this
next tale... Under the full moon,

23:35.582 --> 23:39.118
the Ontario crashed and ran
aground on the near by...

23:39.151 --> 23:44.023
Rose and Crown shoal. Many of
its crew went missing.

23:44.056 --> 23:50.530
Months passed... then a year,
and more. Every day she waited,

23:50.563 --> 23:56.869
through sun and storm,
for 15 long years.

23:56.903 --> 24:03.876
Then, poof. Gone.

24:03.910 --> 24:08.915
Some say death due to
heartbreak. But in truth,

24:08.948 --> 24:11.918
it was a mystery.

24:11.951 --> 24:15.822
Our next stop will include
two houses, with their own

24:15.855 --> 24:20.092
unique tales. Now follow me.

24:23.095 --> 24:26.533
[Maddi] Is this guy even for real?
He's more weird than creepy

24:26.566 --> 24:28.267
or ghostly. I can't
even take him seriously.

24:28.300 --> 24:30.937
[Jake] I don't know how you even
took him seriously in the first

24:30.970 --> 24:33.673
place. I mean, there's no
such thing as ghosts.

24:52.091 --> 24:54.927
Jeepers, Daphne, we'll get to
the bottom of this in no time.

24:54.961 --> 24:56.629
[Maddi]
Hey. We might get some answers.

24:56.663 --> 25:00.967
[Silas] Now, here we have
the Jared Coffin House,

25:01.000 --> 25:04.771
who built the house in
honor of his beloved wife.

25:04.804 --> 25:09.909
Next to the Coffin House is the
home Asa Austin Upton built in

25:09.942 --> 25:16.315
honor of his wife, Ophelia,
who went insane and died from

25:16.348 --> 25:20.787
drowning in Hummock Pond after
she thought she'd been turned

25:20.820 --> 25:24.824
into a bottle-nose porpoise.

25:24.857 --> 25:28.060
[Billy] The Coffin House
was a wedding present...

25:28.094 --> 25:30.663
...and her name was Sarah.

25:30.697 --> 25:32.031
[Annabelle]
How do you know that?

25:32.064 --> 25:34.000
[Billy] Everybody who
lives here knows that.

25:34.033 --> 25:36.302
[Silas] Excuse me? Do you think we
might go on with the tour before

25:36.335 --> 25:38.971
people start coming back to life?

25:42.041 --> 25:45.277
Down here to the right you'll
see where Colonel Wilkinson

25:45.311 --> 25:50.349
built the world's first and only
mud-free pig pen... Come along,

25:50.382 --> 25:57.990
come along. So little time, so
many ghosts! Keep moving!

25:58.024 --> 26:00.827
My Goodness.... Put a
load on it, won't you!

26:00.860 --> 26:02.862
[ominous music]

26:12.972 --> 26:16.809
So this, Ladies and
Gentlemen, is the only classroom

26:16.843 --> 26:24.016
that survived the Great
Nantucket Fire of 1846.

26:26.018 --> 26:27.820
[applause]

26:27.854 --> 26:31.323
Thank you. And now, we must
take our leave, for the...

26:31.357 --> 26:35.161
Ghosts of Nantucket will soon appear.

26:41.968 --> 26:49.842
[Tweed] Mr. Grimm, a word if
we may, or rather, an inquiry.

26:49.876 --> 26:51.744
Isn't that right, Mr. Argyle?

26:51.778 --> 26:54.046
[Argyle]
Quite right, Mr. Tweed.

26:54.080 --> 26:56.048
[Silas]
Ah, what now?

26:56.082 --> 27:00.186
[Tweed] A point of curiosity
concerning a bit of local spirit lore.

27:00.219 --> 27:03.923
[Argyle] A curiosity concerning
the sad and terrible tale of...

27:03.956 --> 27:07.226
The Widow in White, who
haunts Innishail House.

27:07.259 --> 27:09.729
Oh, scary.

27:09.762 --> 27:13.099
[Silas] That information was just
recently shared at the start of

27:13.132 --> 27:15.301
our journey this evening.

27:15.334 --> 27:19.839
[Argyle] Just recently shared, you say?
Why, Mr. Tweed, I believe

27:19.872 --> 27:21.808
we missed the tale.

27:21.841 --> 27:27.279
[Tweed] We did indeed miss the tale, Mr.
Argyle. Perhaps Mr. Silas

27:27.313 --> 27:32.118
will repeat the sad saga
of The Widow In White.

27:32.151 --> 27:35.354
[Silas] Oh, dear. Look at the time.
It honestly prevents me from giving

27:35.387 --> 27:41.127
you a proper good night,
but I will bid you adieu...

27:45.998 --> 27:47.900
[Annabelle]
The Widow In White?

27:47.934 --> 27:51.303
[Maddi] Has to be. It's a
collective apparition.

27:51.337 --> 27:53.205
[Annabelle]
A what?

27:53.239 --> 27:55.074
[Maddi] More than one person has
seen the same ghost. It's more

27:55.107 --> 27:57.209
confirmation that there's
definitely paranormal activity

27:57.243 --> 27:59.311
going on in that
vacation house of yours.

27:59.345 --> 28:02.849
[Jake] Not just the vacation house.
I mean if you believe Silas,

28:02.882 --> 28:04.917
they're all over the island.

28:04.951 --> 28:07.887
[Annabelle] Silas has to know about
The Widow In White. I mean, did you

28:07.920 --> 28:11.758
just see his face? And then
he said he'd mentioned her.

28:11.791 --> 28:14.761
[Jake] He said a lot of stuff.
Who could keep up?

28:16.763 --> 28:20.099
[Annabelle] We have to get to
him when he's not on the tour.

28:20.132 --> 28:22.301
Find out what he really knows.

28:22.334 --> 28:26.105
[Jake] Those guys were seriously weird.
I mean who even talks like that?

28:26.138 --> 28:27.974
Or dresses like that.

28:28.007 --> 28:30.276
[Billy]
I think I can help.

28:30.309 --> 28:32.779
[Jake] I'm sorry. Who are you?
Why are you here?

28:32.812 --> 28:37.483
[Billy] My name is Billy, and I think
I know where we can find Silas.

28:37.516 --> 28:40.486
[phone ringing]

28:40.519 --> 28:42.488
[Jake]
Is it Mom?

28:42.521 --> 28:44.791
[Maddi] Yeah. We gotta go. Can we
meet back here in the morning and

28:44.824 --> 28:46.492
maybe figure something out.

28:46.525 --> 28:48.160
[Annabelle] Yeah. For sure.
Thanks for coming. Bye, you guys.

28:48.194 --> 28:50.062
[Jake]
See ya.

28:50.096 --> 28:53.332
[Annabelle]
Oh bye, Jake.

28:53.365 --> 28:56.402
[Billy] Can I walk you
back to your bike?

28:56.435 --> 28:58.871
[Annabelle] No, no. You
don't have to do that.

28:58.905 --> 29:01.240
[Billy]
But, I'd like to.

29:02.474 --> 29:04.777
[Annabelle]
Ahem... [clears throat]

29:04.811 --> 29:10.482
So you told me you're from here?
How long have you lived here?

29:10.516 --> 29:12.418
[Billy] Since the day I was born.
I've never been beyond the

29:12.451 --> 29:14.353
waters around the island.

29:14.386 --> 29:16.022
[Annabelle]
Have you ever wanted to?

29:16.055 --> 29:17.990
[Billy]
What do you mean?

29:18.024 --> 29:23.062
[Annabelle] I don't know. Try something
new? Get a change of scenery?

29:23.095 --> 29:25.097
Maybe go on an adventure?

29:25.131 --> 29:28.567
[Billy] There's plenty of
adventure here, trust me.

29:28.600 --> 29:32.839
But yeah, I'd like to be
able to leave one day.

29:32.872 --> 29:35.942
[Annabelle]
Where would you go?

29:35.975 --> 29:40.312
[Billy]
Anywhere.

29:40.346 --> 29:44.150
[Annabelle] Well, thanks for
making sure I got back safely.

29:46.118 --> 29:48.287
Hey, I guess it's a good thing
that you didn't actually have

29:48.320 --> 29:51.924
to protect me from anything.
Not that you couldn't because

29:51.958 --> 29:54.293
you could... [nervously]
if you needed to.

29:54.326 --> 29:58.164
[Billy] If I needed to, I
can do just about anything.

29:58.197 --> 30:01.367
Even protect you.

30:01.400 --> 30:03.302
[Annabelle]
Hmmmm.

30:03.335 --> 30:05.972
[Billy] I don't have a bike here,
otherwise I'd make sure you got

30:06.005 --> 30:09.275
home the rest of the way.

30:09.308 --> 30:13.279
[Annabelle] It's okay. I'm
sure nothing will get me.

30:13.312 --> 30:15.314
[Billy]
I wouldn't be too sure.

30:17.316 --> 30:19.318
Just kidding.

30:22.621 --> 30:27.626
[Annabelle] That wasn't funny.
[giggling] I guess I should go.

30:27.659 --> 30:30.062
[Billy]
Have a good night, Annabelle.

30:30.096 --> 30:35.434
[Annabelle]
Yeah, you too.

30:35.467 --> 30:37.603
Wait! Will I see you
in the morning?

30:45.011 --> 30:47.546
This is it.

30:49.548 --> 30:52.218
[Jake] So the plan is just to show
up at this guy's house and try to

30:52.251 --> 30:53.552
get information out of him?

30:53.585 --> 30:56.989
[Maddi]
Yes.

30:57.023 --> 30:59.591
[Jake]
Yeah, that'll totally work.

30:59.625 --> 31:01.193
[Annabelle]
The door's over here.

31:03.195 --> 31:05.664
[Silas]
Go away! We don't want any!

31:05.697 --> 31:09.035
[Annabelle]
Good, 'cause we don't have any!

31:12.571 --> 31:15.674
Don't worry. We're harmless.

31:15.707 --> 31:21.213
Wait, wait! Look, it's either
you help us, or those two guys

31:21.247 --> 31:23.182
who showed up last night.

31:23.215 --> 31:25.384
[Silas]
All right. All right.

31:29.688 --> 31:31.890
[mysterious music]

31:39.098 --> 31:42.501
All right, you little weasels.
Pretty much everything in here

31:42.534 --> 31:44.937
is priceless, so don't touch anything.

31:44.971 --> 31:46.272
[Annabelle]
Priceless?

31:46.305 --> 31:48.274
[Jake]
It's a heap of junk.

31:48.307 --> 31:50.076
[Maddi] I would say that nothing
here looks like it would be valued

31:50.109 --> 31:52.144
at being worth more than a few dollars.

31:52.178 --> 31:54.546
[Silas]
Oh, really? Is this junk?

31:54.580 --> 31:58.484
Just a little souvenir, I
wrestled from the jaws of an

31:58.517 --> 32:00.486
extinct albino gorilla shark.

32:00.519 --> 32:02.288
[Maddi] The very fact that something
is extinct, would mean that you

32:02.321 --> 32:05.357
wouldn't be able to wrestle
with it. You know, due to

32:05.391 --> 32:07.093
it being nonexistent.

32:07.126 --> 32:10.162
[Silas] It wasn't extinct
until I got done with it.

32:10.196 --> 32:14.333
[Annabelle] What do you know
about The Widow In White.

32:14.366 --> 32:15.968
[Silas] I have a little policy.
I don't get involved with

32:16.002 --> 32:18.537
the ghosts, and they don't
get involved with me.

32:18.570 --> 32:20.572
[Annabelle] So basically,
you're afraid to tell us.

32:20.606 --> 32:25.577
[Silas] Pretty much. Plus... I don't
like to leave things to chance.

32:25.611 --> 32:28.014
Though in your case,
I might make an exception.

32:28.047 --> 32:30.116
[Billy]
What kind of exception?

32:30.149 --> 32:37.156
[Silas] All you've gotta do is find
the Red Queen. What do you say?

32:37.189 --> 32:39.725
[Jake]
I don't want any part of this.

32:42.761 --> 32:48.534
[Silas] You win, I share
what I know. Deal?

32:48.567 --> 32:50.236
[Annabelle]
Deal.

32:50.269 --> 32:55.274
[Silas] Your move, gumshoe.
Where's the Red Queen?

32:55.307 --> 32:58.310
[Annabelle]
She is right...

33:06.585 --> 33:08.120
...here!

33:08.154 --> 33:13.025
[Silas]
Fine! A deal's a deal.

33:13.059 --> 33:17.229
So here's what I know:
Zero, zilch, nada.

33:17.263 --> 33:19.131
[Annabelle]
What!?

33:19.165 --> 33:26.305
[Silas] But, I do know somebody
who does know or two somebodies.

33:26.338 --> 33:32.111
And that ain't half bad. Tata!

33:34.313 --> 33:37.683
[Annabelle]
Next stop: Beadle's Shop.

33:37.716 --> 33:39.718
[Maddi] How did you know
where the Red Queen was?

33:39.751 --> 33:42.421
[Annabelle] I didn't. But whenever
Silas said the Red Queen, he didn't

33:42.454 --> 33:45.791
look at the cards. He glanced
at his pocket instead.

33:45.824 --> 33:48.694
[Jake] You're kinda scary
sometimes, you know that?

33:48.727 --> 33:51.063
[Billy]
She's brilliant.

33:51.097 --> 33:53.632
But if you think that's scary
wait till you see a ghost.

33:57.636 --> 33:59.638
[Jake] [mocking Billy] Wait
till you've seen a ghost.

34:05.511 --> 34:08.580
[Annabelle] This is it. The Beadle's
are psychic mediums. Maybe they'll

34:08.614 --> 34:11.183
have some information we
can use, like Silas said,

34:11.217 --> 34:13.418
so we should just go
straight in and ask them...

34:13.452 --> 34:15.554
[Billy] Uhm, you guys go on without me.
I'll catch up later.

34:15.587 --> 34:17.389
[Annabelle]
Wait, Billy. Where are you...

34:17.422 --> 34:19.158
[Jake]
Nice knowin' ya!

34:19.190 --> 34:20.292
[Maddi]
You're so obvious.

34:20.326 --> 34:21.659
[phone ringing]

34:21.693 --> 34:23.195
Oh no!

34:23.228 --> 34:25.231
[Annabelle]
What's the matter?

34:25.264 --> 34:27.366
[Maddi] Text from Mom. We gotta go.
It's our Nana's 80th birthday party.

34:27.399 --> 34:29.368
[Annabelle]
No it's fine.

34:29.400 --> 34:30.702
[Maddi]
Come on.

34:30.735 --> 34:32.838
[Jake]
Uhmm, catch ya... later?

34:32.871 --> 34:35.841
[Annabelle]
[chuckles] Bye, Jake.

34:40.679 --> 34:43.382
[sighing] Okay, yeah.

34:43.415 --> 34:45.751
[door creaking]

34:50.688 --> 34:52.690
[door bangs shut]

34:57.629 --> 34:59.631
[mysterious music]

35:12.644 --> 35:18.517
[Phoebe] [distant] Flower of this
purple dye, hit with Cupid's archery.

35:18.550 --> 35:23.355
Sink in apple of his eye
when his love he doth espy.

35:23.389 --> 35:26.525
Let her shine as gloriously
as the Venus of the sky.

35:26.558 --> 35:31.630
When thou wakest, if she be by,
beg of her for remedy.

35:31.663 --> 35:35.834
Captain of our fairy band,
Helena is here at hand...

35:35.867 --> 35:37.236
[Annabelle]
Hello?

35:37.269 --> 35:38.804
[Phoebe]
Oh!

35:38.837 --> 35:40.172
[Prentice]
Phoebe!

35:40.206 --> 35:41.273
[Phoebe]
Mother!

35:41.307 --> 35:42.808
[Prentice]
She's here!

35:42.841 --> 35:44.510
[Phoebe]
Who's here?

35:44.543 --> 35:46.612
[Prentice]
Young lady...

35:46.645 --> 35:48.880
[whispering] ...from
the Innishail House!

35:48.914 --> 35:53.419
[Phoebe] Ohhh! Well why
didn't you say so?

35:53.452 --> 35:55.254
[Prentice]
Hello my dear!

35:55.287 --> 35:56.822
[Phoebe]
So glad you could make it.

35:56.855 --> 35:58.624
[Prentice]
You're so pretty! Come sit.

35:58.657 --> 36:00.926
[Annabelle]
Oh, you were expecting me?

36:00.959 --> 36:02.761
[Prentice] Oh, well, we
knew you were coming.

36:02.794 --> 36:04.696
They're just a little hazy on the names.

36:04.730 --> 36:07.533
[Annabelle]
They? [Akward pause] Hi...

36:07.566 --> 36:08.900
[Prentice]
What was your name again?

36:08.934 --> 36:11.503
[Annabelle] Uhmm, Annabelle.
Annabelle Hooper.

36:11.537 --> 36:12.704
I came because I had a quest...

36:12.738 --> 36:14.506
[Prentice]
Lillian!

36:14.540 --> 36:17.309
[Annabelle]
No, no, no, Annabelle.

36:17.343 --> 36:22.781
[Phoebe] [giggling] That is exactly
what Lillian said she would say.

36:22.814 --> 36:24.950
[Annabelle]
I don't know who Lillian is.

36:24.983 --> 36:28.754
[Prentice]
Lillian. Lillian Swann?

36:28.787 --> 36:31.390
Oh, who married and became
Lillian Caulfield.

36:31.423 --> 36:33.959
[Phoebe]
The Widow In White?

36:35.961 --> 36:39.298
You mean to say, you've never
heard the sad and terrible tale

36:39.331 --> 36:40.599
of The Widow In White...

36:40.632 --> 36:42.901
[Prentice]
who haunts Innishail House?

36:42.934 --> 36:47.273
[Annabelle] Only until recently...
I just wasn't aware of her name.

36:47.306 --> 36:50.342
[Prentice] Some say that she
died of a broken heart...

36:50.376 --> 36:53.612
[Phoebe]
But in truth, it's a mystery.

36:53.645 --> 36:56.515
[Prentice] To this very day, there
are those who have seen her at

36:56.548 --> 37:00.319
night between the waxing
gibbous and full moon, still in

37:00.352 --> 37:06.525
her wedding dress, roaming the
grounds of Innishail House...

37:06.558 --> 37:07.993
[Annabelle] You said
that you spoke to her...

37:08.026 --> 37:10.796
[Phoebe] Spoke? Oh no, never spoke.
Certainly not...

37:10.829 --> 37:12.264
[Annabelle]
Okay, but then how would you...

37:12.298 --> 37:13.465
[Prentice]
We read the signs, my dear.

37:13.499 --> 37:15.734
[Phoebe]
We read the signs.

37:17.736 --> 37:19.805
[Prentice] [whispering] The
Ghosts of Nantucket have ways

37:19.838 --> 37:21.473
of their own.

37:21.507 --> 37:24.410
[Phoebe] And they never are
quite what you expect.

37:24.443 --> 37:26.478
[cuckoo clock strikes]

37:26.512 --> 37:28.680
[Prentice] [alarmed] Oh, dear Phoebe!
Is that the time? It is the time!

37:28.714 --> 37:30.716
We're going to be late for
rehearsal! Thank you for

37:30.749 --> 37:32.818
stopping by. You'll have to
come back when we have more...

37:32.851 --> 37:34.286
[Phoebe]
time!

37:34.320 --> 37:36.588
[Annabelle]
I have one more question...

37:40.659 --> 37:42.928
What just happened?

37:44.930 --> 37:47.433
[mysterious music]

37:54.740 --> 37:57.909
[Billy]
Hey.

37:57.943 --> 38:05.951
[Annabelle]
Hi! Oh. Thanks.

38:05.984 --> 38:08.520
So, where did you go?

38:08.554 --> 38:11.790
[Billy] I followed those two men,
Argyle and Tweed. They were talking

38:11.823 --> 38:14.460
about some guy called, "The Curator."

38:14.493 --> 38:16.462
[Annabelle]
The Curator?

38:16.495 --> 38:18.063
[Billy] Yeah. He has them looking for
something that used to belong to...

38:18.096 --> 38:22.601
Captain Caulfield. Something
called, "The Eye of the Storm."

38:22.634 --> 38:24.836
[Annabelle]
The Eye of the Storm?

38:24.870 --> 38:27.373
Wait, there's a note
about that in this book.

38:27.406 --> 38:29.074
[Billy] From what I could tell,
it's hidden on the island somewhere

38:29.107 --> 38:30.776
and it's worth a lot of money.

38:30.809 --> 38:32.778
[Annabelle]
Well, what is it?

38:32.811 --> 38:34.513
[Billy] They didn't say actually and
they didn't hang around for very

38:34.546 --> 38:36.348
long either. After they bought a
piece of parchment with

38:36.382 --> 38:38.450
something scrawled on it, they
went straight to the Athenaeum

38:38.484 --> 38:42.020
and looked at pretty much
everything except the books.

38:42.053 --> 38:45.957
[Annabelle] That parchment paper! It
has to be a clue! We have to get it!

38:45.991 --> 38:48.794
[Billy]
I guess so. Yeah!

38:50.796 --> 38:55.567
[Annabelle] Uhmm. I just remembered, I
can't tonight. I promised my family

38:55.601 --> 39:00.539
I'd hang out with them. Can we
please meet back here tomorrow?

39:00.572 --> 39:03.575
[Billy] Of course. I'll
look forward to it.

39:22.628 --> 39:24.696
[Annabelle]
[whispers] Lillian?

39:27.032 --> 39:29.134
[mysterious music]

40:01.900 --> 40:05.070
[Burt]
Boo! [Laughing]

40:05.103 --> 40:11.443
[Annabelle] So. Not. Funny!
[laughing] Why? Not cool.

40:11.477 --> 40:14.112
[Burt] I totally got you.
I totally got you.

40:14.145 --> 40:16.948
[picture click]

40:16.982 --> 40:20.118
[Annabelle] Hey. All right you guys,
so, I did some thinking last night

40:20.151 --> 40:23.088
and here's what I came up with...

40:25.757 --> 40:31.963
[Tweed] Mr. Argyle, I do believe
our ship is about to come in,

40:31.997 --> 40:33.699
as they say.

40:33.732 --> 40:37.903
[Argyle] I dare say you are
right about that, Mr. Tweed.

40:37.936 --> 40:42.741
[Tweed] And now, a most exquisite
supposition, if I may.

40:42.774 --> 40:46.177
[Argyle] By all means, Mr.
Tweed. By all means.

40:46.211 --> 40:50.181
[Tweed] What if what our employer
says is true, and the magic contained

40:50.215 --> 40:55.821
in The Eye of Storm could
take us to Fiddler's Green,

40:55.854 --> 40:58.824
just where that lamentable
Captain Caulfield landed

40:58.857 --> 41:03.161
all those years ago? Hmm?

41:03.194 --> 41:06.264
[both giggling]

41:06.297 --> 41:10.235
[Argyle] I can only conjecture, Mr.
Tweed, that such a

41:10.268 --> 41:13.839
development would solely resolve
in our gaining possession of

41:13.872 --> 41:17.075
treasures quite beyond the
powers of the imagination!

41:19.077 --> 41:21.279
[Tweed] What do you suppose our
employer intends to do with

41:21.312 --> 41:23.615
the blasted thing?

41:23.649 --> 41:26.084
[Argyle]
Ours is not to wonder why...

41:26.117 --> 41:30.155
[Tweed] At the very least, we'll
be in possession of this...

41:30.188 --> 41:31.557
...little island.

41:31.590 --> 41:33.859
[Argyle]
Oh, yes, at the very least.

41:33.892 --> 41:38.063
[Tweed] I was thinking a safari range.
This continent lacks adventure.

41:38.096 --> 41:41.967
[Jake] Hey, ah, mister!
Help save the whales?

41:42.000 --> 41:45.637
[Tweed] Young man, have you
taken leave of your senses?

41:45.671 --> 41:47.906
[Jake] You can feed a whale
with just a few pennies a day!

41:47.939 --> 41:51.042
[Tweed]
Feed a... certainly not!

41:51.076 --> 41:53.545
[Jake]
How about five bucks, then?

41:53.579 --> 41:54.980
[Argyle and Tweed]
The nerve!

41:55.013 --> 41:56.848
[Annabelle]
Ugh! The nerve!

41:56.882 --> 41:59.250
Really you guys, no need to
worry about saving the whales...

41:59.284 --> 42:02.854
Look at them, they're huge! What
you need to worry about saving

42:02.888 --> 42:04.923
are the manatees!

42:04.956 --> 42:09.294
[Jake] The manatees? You're joking!
They're the cows of the sea!

42:09.327 --> 42:11.296
[Annabelle]
Who are you calling a cow?

42:11.329 --> 42:13.064
[Billy] Ignore them both!
What you really need to save

42:13.098 --> 42:14.666
are the seals.

42:14.700 --> 42:16.602
[Annabelle and Jake]
The seals?

42:16.635 --> 42:19.070
[Billy] Well yeah, they're the
puppies, the puppies of the sea.

42:19.104 --> 42:21.306
The puppies...

42:21.339 --> 42:22.708
[Argyle]
Ohhh!

42:22.741 --> 42:25.076
[Tweed]
Egad!

42:27.913 --> 42:29.147
[Annabelle]
Go, go!

42:31.149 --> 42:33.118
Excuse me! Pardon me!

42:33.151 --> 42:35.754
[uptempo chase music]

42:51.970 --> 42:53.839
[Jake] Wait, so this is
where you're staying?

42:53.872 --> 42:55.607
[Annabelle]
Yeah.

42:55.641 --> 42:59.044
[Jake] I was expecting something
ultra creepy. Not this.

42:59.077 --> 43:01.379
[Maddi] I don't care how nice it is.
I would never stay here.

43:01.412 --> 43:03.381
[Jake]
I would.

43:03.414 --> 43:05.751
[Maddi] This coming from the guy, who
still sleeps with a night light.

43:05.784 --> 43:08.854
[Jake] It's a lava lamp.
There's a big difference.

43:08.887 --> 43:11.657
[Annabelle]
Hey, are you coming?

43:11.690 --> 43:15.026
[Billy]
Yeah. Yeah, I'm coming.

43:21.667 --> 43:23.101
[Annabelle]
Do you have it?

43:23.134 --> 43:26.104
Thanks. Okay...

43:26.137 --> 43:29.941
[Jake]
Well? What does it say?

43:29.975 --> 43:34.079
[Annabelle] Thy father was a sailor
man who left what he held dear...

43:34.112 --> 43:38.717
He left his home, he left
his love, just as the storm

43:38.750 --> 43:42.153
drew near. He left his heart
high up above, then crowned

43:42.187 --> 43:47.659
a rose below. Find them
'fore the full moon fades

43:47.693 --> 43:51.029
to reveal what they bestow.

43:51.062 --> 43:53.198
[Jake]
And what does any of that mean?

43:53.231 --> 43:55.300
[Maddi]
A full moon?

43:55.333 --> 43:57.135
[Annabelle] It sounds like we need to
figure this out before the end of the

43:57.168 --> 44:00.238
full moon. Which means we need
to find The Eye of the Storm,

44:00.271 --> 44:02.073
and fast.

44:02.107 --> 44:04.743
[Jake] Or else Nantucket becomes
a giant safari, which would

44:04.776 --> 44:08.279
actually be kinda cool. It would!

44:08.313 --> 44:11.783
[Annabelle] We need more clues, right?
Okay. There's gotta be something

44:11.817 --> 44:13.785
else in here.

44:13.819 --> 44:16.822
See, this book has been full
of clues the whole time.

44:24.863 --> 44:27.733
There's got to be something
in that bookcase.

44:31.737 --> 44:33.872
Hear, look at this.

44:38.877 --> 44:41.379
[Jake] Technically this is still our
vacation, so I'm not really sure

44:41.412 --> 44:44.716
if I wanna be doing th...
[loud thud]

44:44.750 --> 44:46.952
I did not do that!

44:46.985 --> 44:49.220
[Annabelle]
Yes you did.

44:49.254 --> 44:52.323
[Annabelle and Maddi]
Secret bookcase!

44:52.357 --> 44:55.360
[Jake]
[mumbling] Secret boo... Okay.

44:55.393 --> 44:57.896
[Annabelle]
Okay, here. Help me pull it out.

45:00.866 --> 45:03.401
[mysterious music]

45:05.771 --> 45:08.774
It's Captain Caulfield and Lillian.

45:23.254 --> 45:25.791
What are you hiding in there?

45:34.265 --> 45:36.802
[piano music]

45:43.341 --> 45:46.444
They looked so happy.

45:46.477 --> 45:49.781
[Maddi]
Yeah.

45:49.815 --> 45:53.218
[Billy]
They were.

45:53.251 --> 45:55.253
[Annabelle]
What?

45:55.286 --> 45:57.122
[Billy] Legend is that they were
so in love, they couldn't wait to

45:57.155 --> 45:59.190
be married, even though
Captain Caulfield was set to

45:59.224 --> 46:02.127
leave the island on a
whaling expedition.

46:04.062 --> 46:05.931
They were married one
morning in front of only a

46:05.964 --> 46:08.867
few friends and family.

46:10.869 --> 46:13.972
Back then, after a wedding,
the groom ascended the church

46:14.005 --> 46:17.475
stairs and rung the bell with
five quick tolls to announce to

46:17.508 --> 46:20.879
the entire island that a
wedding had just occurred.

46:20.912 --> 46:24.850
But as they say, "The sea waits
for no man", and the very next

46:24.883 --> 46:27.953
day, Captain Caulfield and
Lillian Swann had to say their

46:27.986 --> 46:31.990
goodbyes. Just before he left,
Lillian placed half a locket

46:32.023 --> 46:35.894
around his neck as she said:
'That you may return to me.

46:35.927 --> 46:38.864
To the end of the world and back.'

46:40.866 --> 46:43.001
[piano music]

46:55.480 --> 46:57.482
[thunder strikes]

47:00.551 --> 47:05.423
That night, disaster struck,
many of the crew of The Ontario

47:05.456 --> 47:10.061
became a part of what's known as
the graveyard of the Atlantic.

47:10.095 --> 47:16.167
But Arthur, Arthur somehow
landed at Fiddler's Green;

47:16.201 --> 47:20.972
A Sailor's paradise.
Back at home, Lillian refused to

47:21.006 --> 47:25.510
believe that Arthur had died.
Every night for 15 years, she

47:25.543 --> 47:29.014
stood at the top of the house
and watched for his return.

47:29.047 --> 47:31.917
Then one day, she disappeared.

47:31.950 --> 47:36.121
Some say she died of a broken
heart. Legend says Arthur

47:36.154 --> 47:39.590
captured some of the power of
Fiddler's Green in the locket

47:39.624 --> 47:43.194
and used it to find his way
home. But of course,

47:43.228 --> 47:48.333
when Arthur finally arrived,
Lillian was gone.

47:48.366 --> 47:51.202
He was devastated.

47:51.236 --> 47:54.139
But he believed that if he left
the power of Fiddler's Green

47:54.172 --> 47:57.075
behind, Lillian and their child
would somehow find their way

47:57.108 --> 48:01.246
back to him. So he hid the
necklace she gave him in a

48:01.279 --> 48:07.352
cupboard and locked it away with
a key. Then, Arthur ascended the

48:07.385 --> 48:11.389
stairs at the church and slowly
rang the bell ten times so the

48:11.422 --> 48:16.194
entire island would know he
had suffered a loss.

48:16.227 --> 48:19.330
While up there, it's said he
carved a heart with their

48:19.364 --> 48:22.500
initials in the windowsill.

48:25.403 --> 48:28.239
He boarded a ship bound for
Tahiti, in hopes that he would

48:28.273 --> 48:33.144
again find Fiddler's Green...
but he made sure to leave a

48:33.178 --> 48:35.646
note and a key behind...

48:46.457 --> 48:51.963
He promised to wait for them on
the shores of Fiddler's Green.

48:51.997 --> 48:53.999
Forever.

48:56.234 --> 48:58.669
[Annabelle]
That's so beautiful.

48:58.703 --> 49:00.705
[Maddi]
Heartbreaking.

49:06.444 --> 49:08.613
[Maddi]
You okay, big brother?

49:08.646 --> 49:13.251
[Jake] [sniffling] Yeah, yeah.
It's just something in my eye.

49:13.284 --> 49:16.321
Like an... eyelash.

49:16.354 --> 49:20.358
[Annabelle] Okay, uhm. It's too dark
to look for any more clues right?

49:20.391 --> 49:24.462
So we should meet back here in
the morning and we can regroup.

49:24.495 --> 49:26.697
[Jake]
Where do we even start?

49:33.704 --> 49:36.241
[Annabelle]
Here.

49:45.383 --> 49:48.686
Okay, so, we've got to get the
key to the cupboard before the

49:48.719 --> 49:52.090
full moon. Based on the legend,
we should be able to find our

49:52.123 --> 49:54.525
next clue at the top of the steeple.

49:54.559 --> 49:57.428
That's where the heart should be.

49:57.462 --> 50:00.431
[Jake]
Guys...

50:00.465 --> 50:02.267
[Annabelle]
Jake what's the matter?

50:04.269 --> 50:09.507
[Jake] I'm not going up there. No.
It's just... I'm not. Okay?

50:09.540 --> 50:11.076
[Maddi]
He's got acrophobia.

50:11.109 --> 50:12.243
[Annabelle]
He's got what?

50:12.277 --> 50:13.244
[Maddi]
He's afraid of heights.

50:13.278 --> 50:15.346
[Jake]
Shhh!

50:15.380 --> 50:17.448
[Annabelle] Shhh, both of you! Jake,
please get your thumb outta your mouth.

50:17.482 --> 50:20.017
Let's go. Seriously.

50:30.261 --> 50:32.263
It's up here.

50:32.297 --> 50:35.333
[Jake] I wanted to go to scuba diving,
but no, we just had to come to...

50:35.366 --> 50:40.171
Nantucket for Nana's birthday
party. Look where that got me.

50:40.205 --> 50:42.607
[Annabelle] Okay, the heart has
to be in here somewhere, so just

50:42.640 --> 50:45.042
split up and look around.

50:50.215 --> 50:52.317
Hey, you okay?

50:52.350 --> 50:54.419
[Jake]
Yeah, yeah. I'm enjoying it.

51:02.460 --> 51:04.662
[Annabelle] There's a bunch
of carvings over here.

51:08.366 --> 51:11.202
Hey! That boat looks just
like The Ontario!

51:11.236 --> 51:13.771
[Billy] It is. It was brought back
and repaired after the crash.

51:19.144 --> 51:20.511
[Annabelle]
There's a heart.

51:20.545 --> 51:22.847
[Maddi]
That has to be it! AC+LS.

51:22.880 --> 51:24.115
[Annabelle]
Arthur Caulfield...

51:24.149 --> 51:25.216
[Billy]
and Lillian Swann.

51:25.250 --> 51:26.284
[Annabelle]
Yes!

51:26.317 --> 51:28.686
[Jake]
What does that mean?

51:28.719 --> 51:30.755
[Annabelle]
I don't know.

51:30.788 --> 51:33.358
What am I missing here?

51:39.830 --> 51:45.170
[Annabelle]
Wait. They line up.

51:45.203 --> 51:47.372
[Maddi] The tip is going
in that direction, like

51:47.405 --> 51:48.673
an arrow towards the...

51:48.706 --> 51:51.342
[Billy]
The Lighthouse at Sankaty Head.

51:51.376 --> 51:54.145
[Annabelle]
"Find them 'fore darkness...

51:54.179 --> 51:59.784
[Billy] "To reveal what...
what they bestow."

51:59.817 --> 52:02.753
[Annabelle] That's it! We have to
get to the lighthouse before dark

52:02.787 --> 52:04.489
to find our next clue.

52:04.522 --> 52:06.291
[Jake] Okay. So we're good here?
We're good?

52:06.324 --> 52:07.492
All right, I'm going.

52:07.525 --> 52:09.694
[Annabelle]
Yes. Move!

52:09.727 --> 52:14.665
[Tweed] Hello my dearies!
Top notch work, I must say.

52:14.699 --> 52:18.369
Although, I must admit it
was a bit of an oversight,

52:18.403 --> 52:23.608
not destroying the clue when
we had the chance, BUT

52:25.610 --> 52:36.387
we'll be certain not to leave
any loose ends from now on.

52:36.421 --> 52:39.757
[Argyle] Stop fiddling with that glove!
Give me that!

52:39.790 --> 52:43.561
[indistinct arguing]

52:43.594 --> 52:45.230
[loud clunk]

52:45.263 --> 52:47.765
Ahhh! Oh! [Pained grumbling]

52:50.501 --> 52:51.469
[Annabelle]
Are they behind us?

52:51.502 --> 52:52.803
[Jake]
No!

52:52.837 --> 52:56.741
[Annabelle]
Go, go, go.

52:56.774 --> 52:59.410
[bell chiming]

53:05.883 --> 53:08.619
[Argyle]
This is all your fault!

53:11.622 --> 53:13.624
[dramatic chase music]

53:22.467 --> 53:24.469
[tires screeching]

53:33.744 --> 53:36.080
[Annabelle] Okay, let's
see what else is in here.

53:40.351 --> 53:44.755
Wait, the rest of the pages are
blank. This must have been as

53:44.789 --> 53:46.691
far as the writer got.

53:46.724 --> 53:50.295
[Maddi] Let's hope this is as far
as Tweed and Argyle get, too.

53:50.328 --> 53:52.930
[Annabelle] We've got to get to
that lighthouse. Let's move.

54:09.046 --> 54:11.982
Okay. Jake, Billy,
you guys look over here.

54:12.016 --> 54:13.751
Maddi, where should we look?

54:13.784 --> 54:15.886
[Maddi] Rose bushes maybe?
The clue mentioned a rose.

54:15.920 --> 54:20.625
[Jake] There's no rose bushes here.
Just a bunch of grass and sand.

54:20.658 --> 54:23.961
[Annabelle] Look. Argyle and Tweed
heard us say where the next clue is.

54:23.994 --> 54:27.298
They could be here any second.
We have to go fast.

54:27.332 --> 54:28.999
[Jake] Look, there's nothing here
all right? We must've got the

54:29.033 --> 54:31.602
clue wrong. The heart could've
been pointing anywhere.

54:31.636 --> 54:32.937
[Billy] I'm not even sure
what we're looking for.

54:32.970 --> 54:34.439
[Jake]
Exactly.

54:34.472 --> 54:37.342
[Annabelle]
We'll know it when we see it.

54:45.115 --> 54:47.452
[Jake]
It's just not my day.

54:50.488 --> 54:52.923
Hey, what's this?

54:54.925 --> 54:58.996
Guys? I think I might
have found something.

54:59.029 --> 55:01.499
[Annabelle]
What is it?

55:04.735 --> 55:06.371
[Maddi] They're carvings,
I think they're places

55:06.404 --> 55:08.373
around the island.

55:08.406 --> 55:10.708
[Jake]
Looks like a compass!

55:14.078 --> 55:15.946
[Annabelle]
The Rose and Crown Shoal!

55:15.980 --> 55:17.882
[Jake]
What's a shoal?

55:17.915 --> 55:19.717
[Billy] It's the shallow part of
the ocean. It makes the waters

55:19.750 --> 55:23.554
around here too dangerous to travel in.

55:23.588 --> 55:25.055
[Jake]
Where are you going?

55:25.089 --> 55:27.425
[Annabelle] To find out where
the arrow is taking us.

55:27.458 --> 55:30.595
[Jake] Oh. All right.
Have fun with that!

55:59.490 --> 56:01.459
[Annabelle]
There's nothing out here.

56:01.492 --> 56:03.728
Think, Annabelle, think.

56:11.836 --> 56:16.006
[Silas V.O.] Under the full moon The
Ontario crashed and ran aground

56:16.040 --> 56:20.010
on the nearby Rose and Crown shoal.

56:22.212 --> 56:27.785
[Annabelle] The Rose and Crown is the
shoal The Ontario ran aground on!

56:30.655 --> 56:34.058
That's it.

56:34.091 --> 56:37.695
The next clue must be on The Ontario!

56:39.697 --> 56:42.700
It's The Ontario!

56:52.477 --> 56:54.779
There's a guard, get down!

57:01.519 --> 57:03.888
[Maddi] He's leaving.
There's our chance.

57:03.921 --> 57:08.659
[whispering] Don't let
the guard see us. Come on!

57:13.498 --> 57:15.666
Over here, stay low.

57:39.557 --> 57:41.659
[Billy]
Guys, I found another heart.

57:41.692 --> 57:43.794
[Maddi]
What?

57:43.828 --> 57:44.962
[Billy]
I found a heart.

57:44.995 --> 57:47.732
[Annabelle]
That's it!

57:47.765 --> 57:49.166
[Jake]
What is it?

57:49.199 --> 57:52.036
[Annabelle] It's some sort
old combination lock.

57:52.069 --> 57:54.138
[Maddi]
How can we work the combination?

57:54.171 --> 57:57.207
[Annabelle] It looks pretty simple
actually. We just have to turn each disk

57:57.241 --> 58:01.145
until the right combination
lines up with the heart.

58:01.178 --> 58:03.748
[Maddi] Five disks with five numbers
with a five digit combination

58:03.781 --> 58:07.217
has 100,000 possible solutions.
We have to narrow it down.

58:07.251 --> 58:08.819
[Annabelle] Try to think of
numbers that Captain Caulfield

58:08.853 --> 58:09.854
might have used.

58:09.887 --> 58:14.258
[Jake]
90210?

58:14.291 --> 58:16.994
[Annabelle] Wait. 1824. It's on
the front of the Innishail House,

58:17.027 --> 58:19.029
it was the year it was built.

58:19.063 --> 58:22.099
[Maddi] That's only four digits.
Here, you take photos of everything.

58:22.132 --> 58:24.735
[Jake]
8675309?

58:24.769 --> 58:29.139
[Maddi] There has to be
something here that can help.

58:29.173 --> 58:30.975
[Maddi]
14650.

58:31.008 --> 58:34.011
That's the distance from here to
Tahiti. Captain Caulfield left

58:34.044 --> 58:35.613
here to travel there.

58:35.646 --> 58:37.615
[Jake] 1492 Columbus
sailed the ocean blue?

58:37.648 --> 58:41.719
[Annabelle] Okay, wait. I got it.
Let's try. Okay? What is it again?

58:41.752 --> 58:43.888
[Maddi]
14,650.

58:52.296 --> 58:53.263
[Annabelle]
That's not it. Keep thinking.

58:53.297 --> 58:55.165
[Jake]
I got nuthin'.

58:55.199 --> 58:57.935
[Maddi] What numbers could possibly...
Wait...

58:57.968 --> 59:01.071
The lighthouse I built out of
sand, the one Jake destroyed...

59:01.105 --> 59:03.674
[Jake]
Some would say improved.

59:03.708 --> 59:06.744
[Maddi] If Nantucket is 41 degrees
North and 75 degrees West,

59:06.777 --> 59:10.114
and Tahiti is 14650 miles
to the southwest,

59:10.147 --> 59:14.218
allowing for approximately
60 miles for every degree...

59:14.251 --> 59:16.887
[Jake] You know, there's a
calculator on the phone you can use.

59:16.921 --> 59:17.955
[Maddi]
Shush!

59:17.988 --> 59:19.957
[Annabelle]
Let her think.

59:19.990 --> 59:23.293
[Maddi] That would place Tahiti at
17 degrees South, 149 degrees West.

59:23.327 --> 59:25.062
[Annabelle]
Are you sure?

59:25.095 --> 59:27.632
[Maddi] Yes, I mean it's between
17 and 18 degrees South

59:27.665 --> 59:29.066
but it's closer to 17.

59:29.099 --> 59:32.102
[Annabelle] Okay, so then
the numbers are 17149?

59:32.136 --> 59:33.704
[Maddi]
Yes.

59:33.738 --> 59:35.205
[Annabelle] Keep your
fingers crossed you guys.

59:35.239 --> 59:37.074
Keep a look out.

59:39.076 --> 59:47.918
[wheel turning]

59:47.952 --> 59:50.287
We did it.

59:50.320 --> 59:52.256
[all laughing]

59:52.289 --> 59:55.826
Let's make this fast, guys!

01:00:09.674 --> 01:00:12.042
[Ghosts] * From Fiddler's
Green, for home to go *

01:00:12.076 --> 01:00:16.814
* Just a whittling as he goes *

01:00:16.847 --> 01:00:21.018
* From Fiddler's Green, for home to go *

01:00:21.051 --> 01:00:26.924
* Just a whittling as he goes *

01:00:26.957 --> 01:00:28.759
[Maddi]
An apparition.

01:00:28.793 --> 01:00:30.795
[Jake]
What?

01:00:30.828 --> 01:00:34.298
[Maddi] The appearance of a person
whose not physically there. So cool.

01:00:34.331 --> 01:00:36.934
[Jake] No, no, I think you mean freaky.
It's... freaky.

01:00:36.967 --> 01:00:45.676
[Ghosts] * Woe The Ontario did roll.
Oh Woe, The Ontario did roll *

01:00:45.710 --> 01:00:50.681
* Just a whittling as he goes *

01:00:50.715 --> 01:00:52.883
[whoosh]

01:00:59.289 --> 01:01:03.060
[Jake] That was a great show
and all, but where's the clue?

01:01:03.093 --> 01:01:06.396
[Annabelle] I think that
the song is the clue.

01:01:06.430 --> 01:01:08.766
[Jake] Then I should've been
paying better attention.

01:01:08.799 --> 01:01:12.703
[Annabelle] Okay, wait.
Fiddler's Green we know about.

01:01:12.737 --> 01:01:16.473
"For he was so young"...
talking about their baby,

01:01:16.506 --> 01:01:22.079
but "whittling as he goes"?
"Heart as white as snow"?

01:01:22.112 --> 01:01:25.382
[Maddi] Whittling: Carving something
from of wood, wax or soap...

01:01:25.415 --> 01:01:31.021
[Jake] Or whale bone, right?
I mean, they're whalers.

01:01:33.023 --> 01:01:36.326
[Annabelle] Heart as white as snow.
He was whittling the key.

01:01:36.360 --> 01:01:41.465
A key as white as snow. The key
is made out of whale bone!

01:01:41.498 --> 01:01:44.034
[Maddi] Let's go to the Athenaeum,
dig around, see if maybe we can find

01:01:44.068 --> 01:01:46.036
something about whale bone.

01:01:46.070 --> 01:01:48.472
[Jake]
What's the...

01:01:48.505 --> 01:01:50.507
[mispronounces] Atheneum?

01:01:50.540 --> 01:01:56.413
[Maddi] Athenaeum. The library. We
can see if the librarian can help.

01:01:56.446 --> 01:01:59.416
[Jake]
You mean Athenarian.

01:01:59.449 --> 01:02:01.418
[Maddi] Clearly I got the
brains in the family.

01:02:01.451 --> 01:02:04.855
[Jake] And obviously I got the looks.
Right, Annabelle?

01:02:04.889 --> 01:02:07.124
[Annabelle]
Right, Jake.

01:02:07.157 --> 01:02:09.359
[Jake] But uh, seriously, I mean,
if we're looking for a whale bone,

01:02:09.393 --> 01:02:11.461
shouldn't we just go to
the Whaling Museum?

01:02:11.495 --> 01:02:16.300
I mean, it literally has
the word whale in it.

01:02:16.333 --> 01:02:18.402
[Annabelle]
You are on a roll.

01:02:18.435 --> 01:02:21.405
[Jake]
I have my moments.

01:02:21.438 --> 01:02:23.874
[Annabelle]
I like it.

01:02:23.908 --> 01:02:26.043
[Maddi]
Pretty impressive.

01:02:29.814 --> 01:02:32.082
[Annabelle]
[whispers] Get down!

01:02:41.558 --> 01:02:44.128
Okay, let's go!

01:02:44.161 --> 01:02:47.064
All right you guys, let's
head back to my house.

01:02:47.097 --> 01:02:50.500
We can get our bikes. Then we'll
head to the Whaling Museum.

01:02:56.874 --> 01:02:58.843
[Meredith] Hey kids, there you are!
I was just wondering

01:02:58.876 --> 01:03:00.845
what you were up to.

01:03:00.878 --> 01:03:03.013
[Annabelle] Oh, we just
swung by to get our bikes.

01:03:03.047 --> 01:03:06.583
[Meredith] Okay, well you just missed
two interesting men that stopped by.

01:03:06.616 --> 01:03:08.552
[Annabelle]
Some men?

01:03:08.585 --> 01:03:11.388
[Meredith] Yes, said they were
historians or something and wanted

01:03:11.421 --> 01:03:13.858
a tour of the house.

01:03:13.891 --> 01:03:16.160
[Annabelle]
You let strangers into our home?

01:03:16.193 --> 01:03:18.528
[Meredith] Oh, give me a little
credit, Annabelle. Now, I stayed with

01:03:18.562 --> 01:03:22.499
them the entire time and only
showed them the Keeping Room.

01:03:22.532 --> 01:03:24.501
For some reason, once they got
inside the house, they only

01:03:24.534 --> 01:03:28.172
wanted to see that one room but
they were really interested in

01:03:28.205 --> 01:03:31.976
the pictures above the mantle.

01:03:33.978 --> 01:03:37.281
[Annabelle] Wait, if Argyle and Tweed
didn't find the secret bookcase then

01:03:37.314 --> 01:03:40.017
that means they didn't find
what they were looking for.

01:03:40.050 --> 01:03:41.018
[Meredith]
Annabelle?

01:03:41.051 --> 01:03:42.953
[Annabelle]
Yeah.

01:03:42.987 --> 01:03:44.554
[Meredith] Somebody called the
house for you a girl named Phoebe?

01:03:44.588 --> 01:03:47.557
She said she thinks she has
something that you might need...

01:03:47.591 --> 01:03:49.093
[Annabelle]
Thanks, Mom.

01:03:49.126 --> 01:03:50.294
[Meredith]
Have fun!

01:03:50.327 --> 01:03:53.097
[Annabelle]
Something I need...

01:03:53.130 --> 01:03:56.066
[uptempo whimsical music]

01:04:00.670 --> 01:04:03.874
Okay, I'll meet you at
the Whaling Museum!

01:04:27.431 --> 01:04:29.133
Hello?

01:04:33.237 --> 01:04:35.239
Phoebe?

01:04:36.673 --> 01:04:38.875
Prentice?

01:04:41.445 --> 01:04:43.580
Anybody here?

01:05:00.730 --> 01:05:02.933
It's Annabelle.

01:05:04.134 --> 01:05:06.136
[Female voice] [distant
whispering] Annabelle...

01:05:08.505 --> 01:05:10.907
[mumbling] This is when you turn around.

01:05:15.112 --> 01:05:17.114
[Female voice] [distant
whispering] Annabelle...

01:05:37.601 --> 01:05:39.636
[Lillian]
I knew you'd come.

01:05:39.669 --> 01:05:41.505
[Annabelle]
[shaky] Lillian?

01:05:41.538 --> 01:05:42.706
[Lillian] I tried to speak to you
at the home, but there never

01:05:42.739 --> 01:05:44.708
seemed to be a good time.

01:05:44.741 --> 01:05:47.544
[Annabelle] Is there ever really a
good time for that sort of thing?

01:05:47.577 --> 01:05:51.481
[Lillian] This island it's haunted.
Not just by spirits, but by

01:05:51.515 --> 01:05:55.986
the past itself... Yet the
two are joined forever.

01:05:56.020 --> 01:05:57.988
[Annabelle]
Joined?

01:05:58.022 --> 01:06:00.490
[Lillian] We cannot escape our time
unless a door is opened by somebody

01:06:00.524 --> 01:06:04.728
between the waxing gibbous and
full moon. The full moon fades

01:06:04.761 --> 01:06:10.000
in a matter of hours
but you can free us!

01:06:10.034 --> 01:06:14.471
[Annabelle] We need the Eye of
the Storm.... and I found it.

01:06:14.504 --> 01:06:17.341
[Lillian] That may be so but it
means nothing if you don't know

01:06:17.374 --> 01:06:19.009
what it is...

01:06:19.043 --> 01:06:21.011
[Annabelle]
What do you mean?

01:06:21.045 --> 01:06:24.014
[Lillian] Its real power is not what
you imagine it to be and it was

01:06:24.048 --> 01:06:28.385
not left for me to find.
I've been waiting for someone

01:06:28.418 --> 01:06:31.421
like you for a very
long time, Annabelle.

01:06:36.160 --> 01:06:38.362
[Annabelle] Wait, who was the
message in the bottle for?

01:06:38.395 --> 01:06:40.597
[Phoebe]
Ohhh! Look, Mother! She's here!

01:06:42.599 --> 01:06:45.035
[Prentice]
There you are!

01:06:46.836 --> 01:06:49.439
For you, my dear.

01:06:49.473 --> 01:06:52.709
[Phoebe]
You're gonna need it.

01:06:55.345 --> 01:06:57.214
[Annabelle]
How did you...

01:06:57.247 --> 01:07:01.651
[Prentice] Ah, we just know and
you'll know when you need it.

01:07:01.685 --> 01:07:04.388
[Annabelle]
Thank you.

01:07:04.421 --> 01:07:06.490
Wish me luck!

01:07:06.523 --> 01:07:09.793
[Phoebe and Prentice]
Luck!

01:07:09.826 --> 01:07:14.331
[Annabelle]
Oh, Billy! Why are you here?

01:07:14.364 --> 01:07:16.133
We were supposed to meet at the museum.

01:07:16.166 --> 01:07:19.503
[Billy] I wanted to make
sure you were okay.

01:07:19.536 --> 01:07:21.205
[Annabelle]
You did?

01:07:21.238 --> 01:07:25.342
[Billy] Of course. Uhmm,
did you find anything new?

01:07:25.375 --> 01:07:29.579
[Annabelle] I did actually
but we can't talk here.

01:07:29.613 --> 01:07:31.781
[Billy]
Let's go.

01:07:31.815 --> 01:07:34.551
[Annabelle] Lillian confirmed that it's
what the Eye of the Storm does that's

01:07:34.584 --> 01:07:37.654
most important. She has to be
freed by someone who wants to

01:07:37.687 --> 01:07:41.391
free her. Not someone who
wants it for themselves.

01:07:41.425 --> 01:07:45.429
[Billy] So... if someone else gets
their hands on the Eye of the Storm,

01:07:45.462 --> 01:07:51.868
Lillian is stuck here? In this
time and dimension? This place?

01:07:51.901 --> 01:07:55.205
[Annabelle]
Exactly.

01:07:55.239 --> 01:07:58.342
She'll never be reunited
with Arthur and...

01:07:58.375 --> 01:08:02.246
she'll always roam this island.

01:08:02.279 --> 01:08:06.283
She'll never find peace.

01:08:09.286 --> 01:08:13.123
We have to find that key, but
we're running out of time.

01:08:17.926 --> 01:08:20.796
[mysterious music]

01:08:20.830 --> 01:08:22.399
[Annabelle]
Hey.

01:08:22.432 --> 01:08:24.468
[Maddi] Hey. We tried
the front, it's locked.

01:08:24.501 --> 01:08:26.603
[Annabelle] Okay, well, there has to
be some sort of side entrance. Right?

01:08:26.636 --> 01:08:28.638
[Maddi]
I guess.

01:08:28.671 --> 01:08:31.675
[Annabelle] Come on, let's go. Okay
you guys, it might be dark in there,

01:08:31.707 --> 01:08:33.643
so use the flashlights on
your phone. Jake, if you see

01:08:33.676 --> 01:08:35.645
someone just say something,
okay? [Gasps] Oh!

01:08:40.684 --> 01:08:44.354
Over here go, go, go! Shhh. Duck.

01:08:51.428 --> 01:08:54.631
Okay, Einstein. You got us here.

01:08:54.663 --> 01:08:57.367
Now figure out how to get us inside.

01:08:57.401 --> 01:09:00.770
[Jake] Is breaking and
entering out of the question?

01:09:00.804 --> 01:09:03.340
[Annabelle and Maddi]
Yes.

01:09:03.372 --> 01:09:04.741
[Jake]
Then I've got nothing.

01:09:04.774 --> 01:09:07.377
[Maddi]
Wait, where's Billy?

01:09:07.411 --> 01:09:10.546
[Billy]
Come on in.

01:09:10.580 --> 01:09:11.747
[Jake] I thought you said
breaking and entering

01:09:11.781 --> 01:09:15.452
was out of the question!

01:09:15.484 --> 01:09:16.953
[Annabelle]
How did get in there?

01:09:16.986 --> 01:09:21.691
[Billy] I told you I could
do just about anything.

01:09:24.228 --> 01:09:26.563
[ominous music]

01:09:33.770 --> 01:09:35.872
[Jake]
Whoa...

01:09:40.676 --> 01:09:45.582
[Annabelle] This is the first place that
my Dad and I came when we got here.

01:09:45.615 --> 01:09:48.785
I can't believe it was right in
front of me the whole time.

01:09:48.818 --> 01:09:50.720
[Billy]
Where do you think the key is?

01:09:50.754 --> 01:09:52.288
[Maddi] We think we're looking for
a key made out of whale tooth

01:09:52.322 --> 01:09:55.559
or whale bone. Let's
split up and have a look.

01:10:07.837 --> 01:10:11.608
[Annabelle] Hey! Don't touch anything.
The last thing we need is to

01:10:11.641 --> 01:10:14.311
break a priceless relic right about now.

01:10:18.982 --> 01:10:20.650
[Jake]
Ow!

01:10:25.054 --> 01:10:27.624
[ominous music]

01:10:36.666 --> 01:10:40.737
[Annabelle] Okay, the key has to be
in here somewhere. Just keep looking.

01:10:47.043 --> 01:10:51.815
[Annabelle V.O.] Wait. I took
pictures when I was here with my Dad.

01:10:51.848 --> 01:10:54.584
Think, Annabelle, think.

01:11:09.633 --> 01:11:13.437
[mumbling] 1846...

01:11:13.470 --> 01:11:14.438
Maddi?

01:11:14.471 --> 01:11:16.940
[Maddi]
Yeah?

01:11:16.973 --> 01:11:18.842
[Annabelle]
What year did The Ontario crash?

01:11:18.875 --> 01:11:22.011
[Maddi]
1830. Why?

01:11:22.045 --> 01:11:25.849
[Annabelle] Lillian waited for 15 years.
Which means she must've

01:11:25.882 --> 01:11:30.354
disappeared in 1845 but when
Arthur returned, she and the

01:11:30.387 --> 01:11:36.726
baby were already gone. Could
his return have been in 1846?

01:11:36.760 --> 01:11:40.096
[Maddi]
Yeah. It could've been.

01:11:40.129 --> 01:11:44.468
[Annabelle] This has gotta be it...
Keep looking guys.

01:11:47.571 --> 01:11:49.839
[mysterious music]

01:12:10.394 --> 01:12:12.996
[victorious music]

01:12:34.017 --> 01:12:39.823
[Annabelle] This is the key to
unlock The Eye of the Storm.

01:12:39.856 --> 01:12:41.057
We have it.

01:12:41.090 --> 01:12:43.059
[Tweed]
I should certainly hope so.

01:12:43.092 --> 01:12:45.495
After all that.

01:12:45.529 --> 01:12:47.997
[Jake]
Man, seriously?!

01:12:48.031 --> 01:12:49.999
[Tweed]
Bravo, young lady!

01:12:50.033 --> 01:12:53.570
Very cleverly done.

01:12:53.603 --> 01:12:57.140
[Argyle]
Very clever, indeed, Mr. Tweed.

01:12:57.173 --> 01:13:00.744
[Tweed] Though perhaps not as
clever as our employer's idea to

01:13:00.777 --> 01:13:06.716
follow you... and let you
solve the puzzles for us.

01:13:06.750 --> 01:13:10.487
[Annabelle] Your employer
is a deranged psychopath.

01:13:10.520 --> 01:13:14.824
[Tweed] Very likely, but at
least we'll be paid handsomely.

01:13:14.858 --> 01:13:17.694
As you know, that key is
all that stands between us

01:13:17.727 --> 01:13:20.196
and untold treasures.

01:13:20.229 --> 01:13:21.965
[Maddi] If you want the key,
you're going to have to

01:13:21.998 --> 01:13:23.633
go through us to get it.

01:13:23.667 --> 01:13:26.736
[Jake] Not me. I mean, at least,

01:13:26.770 --> 01:13:31.174
not at the same time, like maybe
I could be an alternate?

01:13:31.207 --> 01:13:33.877
Like sixth man off the bench.
That kinda deal I can go in to

01:13:33.910 --> 01:13:37.113
give the starters a
breather. If need be...

01:13:37.146 --> 01:13:40.817
[Tweed] Oh no, young man. This
is certainly a full team effort.

01:13:40.850 --> 01:13:42.118
[Annabelle]
NOW!

01:13:42.151 --> 01:13:44.854
[Argyle]
Get them!

01:13:51.094 --> 01:13:53.863
[Annabelle]
Come on!

01:14:07.577 --> 01:14:09.713
Let's go!

01:14:14.784 --> 01:14:15.985
Come on you guys!

01:14:16.019 --> 01:14:17.687
[Maddi]
Where's Billy?

01:14:17.721 --> 01:14:18.688
[Annabelle]
He's not behind us?

01:14:18.722 --> 01:14:20.790
[Maddi]
No.

01:14:20.824 --> 01:14:21.925
[Annabelle] Okay. It's fine. He knows
this town. He'll be able to meet up

01:14:21.958 --> 01:14:23.860
with us. Come on we have no time!

01:14:23.893 --> 01:14:25.795
[Tweed]
After them, Mr. Argyle!

01:14:25.829 --> 01:14:27.931
[tires screeching]

01:14:31.067 --> 01:14:33.737
They're getting away!

01:14:33.770 --> 01:14:39.609
[Argyle] The steering wheel is
on the wrong side of this car!

01:14:39.643 --> 01:14:41.578
[Annabelle]
Jake, you're falling behind!

01:14:41.611 --> 01:14:43.179
[Jake] Okay I lost my candy bar,
I don't know how to ride a bike

01:14:43.212 --> 01:14:44.881
and we're getting chased by
people that want to kill us!

01:14:44.914 --> 01:14:46.282
So give me a break!

01:14:46.315 --> 01:14:47.617
[Maddi]
Stop complaining!

01:14:47.651 --> 01:14:49.018
[Annabelle]
Come on you guys!

01:14:49.052 --> 01:14:50.687
[Jake]
Ohhh, I hate my life.

01:14:50.720 --> 01:14:52.556
[Tweed] There they are! Mr.
Argyle, step on it!

01:14:52.589 --> 01:14:54.924
[Argyle]
Stop telling me how to drive!

01:15:05.268 --> 01:15:06.603
[Tweed]
Cut them off!

01:15:06.636 --> 01:15:08.037
[Annabelle]
Ahh! [Screams] Look out!

01:15:08.071 --> 01:15:09.739
[Tweed] That's them, Mr.
Argyle, turn it around!

01:15:09.773 --> 01:15:13.977
They're getting away!
Turn it around Mr...

01:15:14.010 --> 01:15:16.846
[Argyle]
Move your cart! Out of the way!

01:15:16.880 --> 01:15:18.314
[Tweed]
[yelling] What are you doing?!

01:15:18.347 --> 01:15:20.917
[Argyle]
Move your blooming cart!

01:15:20.950 --> 01:15:22.251
[Annabelle]
Make a left!

01:15:22.285 --> 01:15:23.987
[Maddi]
We owe you one, Silas!

01:15:24.020 --> 01:15:24.988
[Annabelle]
Dad!

01:15:25.021 --> 01:15:26.590
[Meredith]
Hey, kids.

01:15:26.623 --> 01:15:28.858
[Annabelle]
[inaudible]

01:15:28.892 --> 01:15:31.961
[Billy]
Guys, this way.

01:15:31.995 --> 01:15:35.665
[Annabelle]
Okay? Yes. Guys, come on!

01:15:35.699 --> 01:15:37.667
Over here!

01:15:37.701 --> 01:15:38.868
[Maddi] Annabelle, we have
to get back to the house.

01:15:38.902 --> 01:15:39.869
What are you doing?

01:15:39.903 --> 01:15:40.904
[Annabelle]
The boat!

01:15:40.937 --> 01:15:41.905
[Jake]
The boat?

01:15:41.938 --> 01:15:43.072
[Maddi]
Why the boat?

01:15:43.106 --> 01:15:44.574
[Annabelle]
Just trust me, okay?

01:15:44.608 --> 01:15:46.843
[Argyle]
There they are!

01:15:48.978 --> 01:15:51.314
[Annabelle]
You guys good?

01:15:51.347 --> 01:15:53.549
[Jake]
NO!

01:15:56.185 --> 01:16:00.256
[Annabelle] I've got a plan. You two
keep an eye out for Argyle and Tweed.

01:16:00.289 --> 01:16:02.992
Billy, come with me.

01:16:07.030 --> 01:16:10.233
Okay. Thanks.

01:16:12.902 --> 01:16:17.140
[piano music]

01:16:25.782 --> 01:16:26.916
How long have you lived here?

01:16:26.950 --> 01:16:28.652
[Billy]
Since the day I was born.

01:16:28.685 --> 01:16:30.186
I've never been beyond
the waters of the island...

01:16:30.219 --> 01:16:32.221
You think that's scary?
Wait till you see a ghost.

01:16:32.255 --> 01:16:33.857
[Annabelle]
How do you know that?

01:16:33.890 --> 01:16:35.859
[Billy] Everyone who lives here knows...

01:16:35.892 --> 01:16:37.861
If I needed to, I can
do just about anything

01:16:37.894 --> 01:16:39.863
even protect you.

01:16:39.896 --> 01:16:41.998
[Prentice] The Ghosts of Nantucket
have ways of their own...

01:16:42.031 --> 01:16:45.334
[Phoebe] and they never are
quite what you expect.

01:16:45.368 --> 01:16:50.907
[Annabelle]
You're a... a ghost.

01:16:54.410 --> 01:17:00.684
[Jake] There they come!
Come on! Go, go, go!

01:17:00.717 --> 01:17:04.253
Guys, They're right behind us.

01:17:04.287 --> 01:17:07.223
They're... They're here.

01:17:13.462 --> 01:17:21.037
[Argyle] And now, if you'd all
be so kind as to "stick'em up,"

01:17:21.070 --> 01:17:23.339
as they say in the movies.

01:17:23.372 --> 01:17:28.812
[Tweed] You too, young lady! And please,
hand over that key! We have the...

01:17:28.845 --> 01:17:31.280
Eye of the Storm to retrieve.

01:17:31.314 --> 01:17:37.887
[Annabelle] You take one more
step towards me or my friends...

01:17:37.921 --> 01:17:40.924
and I'm throwing the key into the ocean.

01:17:40.957 --> 01:17:44.027
[Billy] Annabelle, if you do
that, my mother and I will never

01:17:44.060 --> 01:17:46.730
be reunited with my father.

01:17:46.763 --> 01:17:51.234
[Annabelle] But... you'll
get to stay here, with us.

01:17:51.267 --> 01:17:53.136
Billy, with me.

01:17:55.939 --> 01:17:57.941
[suspenseful music]

01:18:01.277 --> 01:18:04.413
[Tweed]
NO!

01:18:04.447 --> 01:18:07.250
[Argyle]
No! The ke... the ke...!

01:18:07.283 --> 01:18:08.985
[Tweed]
Use your words!

01:18:09.018 --> 01:18:10.987
[Argyle] The key is in the sea!
The key is in the sea!

01:18:11.020 --> 01:18:13.990
[yelling]
We're not... Get it out!

01:18:14.023 --> 01:18:17.360
[Tweed]
I've got to do everything!

01:18:22.065 --> 01:18:24.133
[Annabelle] Come on!
Don't ask any questions!

01:18:24.167 --> 01:18:26.870
[Jake]
I have a lot of questions!

01:18:28.872 --> 01:18:31.841
[Annabelle]
Billy, run!

01:18:34.410 --> 01:18:35.912
[Tweed]
Hurry up!

01:18:35.945 --> 01:18:37.480
[Prentice]
There they are! Go get them!

01:18:37.513 --> 01:18:39.916
[Phoebe] Those are the men
trying to take over our island!

01:18:39.949 --> 01:18:46.155
[Tweed] No, now you can't take me!
I'm innocent, I tell you.

01:18:46.189 --> 01:18:49.993
[Argyle]
We've got to get that key!

01:18:50.026 --> 01:18:51.928
[Prentice]
Well hello, Mr. Plaid!

01:18:51.961 --> 01:18:54.831
[Tweed]
That is Tweed, not Plaid!

01:18:54.864 --> 01:18:58.334
[Argyle] It's all your fault. You
said Nantucket, I said Bermuda!

01:19:04.240 --> 01:19:06.742
[Annabelle]
Ah... [sighs]

01:19:13.282 --> 01:19:15.852
[Jake] What are you all smiley about?
I mean I can't believe we

01:19:15.885 --> 01:19:18.421
went through all that work just
for you to find that key and

01:19:18.454 --> 01:19:21.390
toss it into the ocean like that.

01:19:21.424 --> 01:19:25.261
[Annabelle] You saw me
throw a key into the ocean...

01:19:25.294 --> 01:19:26.429
[Jake]
Yeah...

01:19:26.462 --> 01:19:29.332
[Annabelle]
...but not the real one.

01:19:29.365 --> 01:19:32.568
[Maddi] Wait, where did
you get a fake one?

01:19:32.601 --> 01:19:39.042
[Annabelle] Prentice and Phoebe
they knew that I needed it. And...

01:19:39.075 --> 01:19:44.080
...it turns out I'm not the
only curious one in the family.

01:19:44.113 --> 01:19:48.017
My dad also tried to solve this
same mystery when he was my age.

01:19:48.051 --> 01:19:51.354
It was his journal. His clues.
I slipped him the real key

01:19:51.387 --> 01:19:52.822
outside the theater.

01:19:52.856 --> 01:19:54.590
[Burt]
How long have you known?

01:19:54.623 --> 01:19:57.026
[Annabelle] A while. It didn't take
me too long to realize they were

01:19:57.060 --> 01:19:59.595
your notes in the journal.

01:19:59.628 --> 01:20:01.397
[Meredith] That's right. You're
handwriting has not changed much since

01:20:01.430 --> 01:20:02.999
you were a little boy.

01:20:03.032 --> 01:20:05.134
[laughing]

01:20:07.036 --> 01:20:08.905
[Burt]
Ready?

01:20:08.938 --> 01:20:11.841
[Annabelle]
Yeah....

01:20:16.612 --> 01:20:19.015
[creaking]

01:20:32.962 --> 01:20:36.532
[Burt] I can't believe
it was here all along.

01:20:49.045 --> 01:20:51.547
[Annabelle]
Thanks, Dad.

01:20:57.586 --> 01:21:01.090
[Jake] So, can somebody fill me in
on what's going on, cuz' I'm kinda

01:21:01.124 --> 01:21:04.360
lost. I mean, I get
the key opens the panel.

01:21:04.393 --> 01:21:08.264
But, what did you guys find?
The Eye of the Storm?

01:21:08.297 --> 01:21:11.300
[Annabelle] The other
half of Lillian's locket.

01:21:11.334 --> 01:21:13.937
[Billy] I believe it's only when
they're put together that they

01:21:13.970 --> 01:21:16.172
become the Eye of the Storm.

01:21:16.205 --> 01:21:18.041
[Meredith]
What is it?

01:21:18.074 --> 01:21:20.576
[Billy] It's a picture of my father.
It belonged to my mother,

01:21:20.609 --> 01:21:24.080
and then when she was gone,
it belonged to me.

01:21:24.113 --> 01:21:26.916
[Jake]
Wait, a picture of what!?!

01:21:26.950 --> 01:21:29.652
[Annabelle] This is what Lillian
gave to Captain Caulfield the day

01:21:29.685 --> 01:21:31.921
that he left on The Ontario.

01:21:31.955 --> 01:21:34.991
[Billy] She kept this half
as a reminder of their love.

01:21:35.024 --> 01:21:41.330
[Maddi] "Your father was a sailor
man who left what he held dear..."

01:21:41.364 --> 01:21:44.667
The message in the bottle
that was for you?

01:21:44.700 --> 01:21:46.569
[Billy]
Yeah.

01:21:46.602 --> 01:21:50.006
[Jake] Whoa, whoa. Back the truck
up, people! Okay, if that's a

01:21:50.039 --> 01:21:54.077
picture of your parents and they
lived 200 years ago then that

01:21:54.110 --> 01:22:00.950
definitely means that you...
are most definitely... a ghost?

01:22:05.321 --> 01:22:07.656
Oh boy.

01:22:07.690 --> 01:22:11.494
[Billy] My father somehow ended
up at Fiddler's Green and he

01:22:11.527 --> 01:22:16.165
captured some of the magic
of the island in the locket.

01:22:16.199 --> 01:22:18.167
It finally brought him home.

01:22:18.201 --> 01:22:21.237
[Annabelle] So Billy left the island
to go in search of his father.

01:22:21.270 --> 01:22:24.640
[Billy] I was 15 years old when I
left Nantucket, and I died in a

01:22:24.673 --> 01:22:28.044
ship wreck not far off the shores...

01:22:28.077 --> 01:22:32.115
I never found my father. Until now...

01:22:32.148 --> 01:22:38.654
After all that time, after
all those years, you...

01:22:38.687 --> 01:22:41.524
you finally found me.

01:22:49.298 --> 01:22:52.001
[Annabelle]
And now...

01:22:56.205 --> 01:22:59.042
Now I have to let you go.

01:23:02.078 --> 01:23:05.081
Are you ready?

01:23:05.114 --> 01:23:07.516
[Billy]
I'm ready.

01:23:12.421 --> 01:23:14.390
[sparkling]

01:23:30.539 --> 01:23:33.376
I'd like you all to meet my parents:

01:23:33.409 --> 01:23:36.045
Arthur and Lillian Caulfield.

01:23:36.079 --> 01:23:39.348
My name is William. William Caulfield.

01:23:42.551 --> 01:23:45.188
[Lillian]
Thank you.

01:23:45.221 --> 01:23:47.090
Thank you.

01:24:00.603 --> 01:24:02.771
[Annabelle]
[whispering] Billy...

01:24:04.773 --> 01:24:07.476
[Billy] To the end of
the world and back.

01:24:13.682 --> 01:24:16.319
[Annabelle] To the end
of the world and back...

01:24:36.905 --> 01:24:41.844
Back to Sailor's paradise.

01:24:41.877 --> 01:24:44.713
Back to Fiddler's Green.

01:24:46.915 --> 01:24:49.785
[piano music]

01:25:00.829 --> 01:25:03.699
[sparkling chimes]

01:25:12.475 --> 01:25:16.145
[Jake]
I kind of liked that kid.

01:25:16.179 --> 01:25:18.181
He grew on me, at least.

01:25:20.183 --> 01:25:22.451
You and I had some pretty good
teamwork back there at the...

01:25:22.485 --> 01:25:26.555
Whaling Museum. It's like we
read each other's minds.

01:25:26.589 --> 01:25:29.925
Pretty cool, huh?

01:25:29.958 --> 01:25:35.231
[Annabelle] Yeah. That's pretty cool.
Mm, hmhmm. [Giggling]

01:25:35.264 --> 01:25:38.867
[Jake]
Uhm... Here.

01:25:38.901 --> 01:25:42.805
Billy gave me this to give
to you. He said he wanted

01:25:42.838 --> 01:25:45.874
you to have it. So... there you go.

01:25:52.648 --> 01:25:55.184
[Annabelle]
Thank you.

01:25:55.218 --> 01:25:57.586
[Jake]
Don't mention it.

01:26:07.730 --> 01:26:09.732
[Maddi]
Hey... Sorry, Romeo.

01:26:11.734 --> 01:26:14.403
[Jake]
Is that really necessary?

01:26:14.437 --> 01:26:15.971
[Maddi]
You'll get her one day.

01:26:16.004 --> 01:26:18.807
[Burt]
You okay?

01:26:18.841 --> 01:26:21.744
[Annabelle]
Yeah. I'm okay.

01:26:21.777 --> 01:26:24.813
[Burt] I've gotta admit,
that that was pretty cool.

01:26:24.847 --> 01:26:27.450
[Annabelle]
It was pretty cool.

01:26:27.483 --> 01:26:31.920
[Burt] I'm so glad I didn't
solve the mystery before.

01:26:31.954 --> 01:26:34.757
[Annabelle]
No? Why not?

01:26:34.790 --> 01:26:37.926
[Burt] 'Cause it is a hundred
times better experiencing it with

01:26:37.960 --> 01:26:41.464
you two... my sidekicks.

01:26:41.497 --> 01:26:42.465
[laughing]

01:26:42.498 --> 01:26:44.767
[Annabelle]
Dad...

01:26:44.800 --> 01:26:46.769
I love you, guys.

01:26:46.802 --> 01:26:48.804
[Burt]
Love you, too.

01:26:50.806 --> 01:26:52.975
So, that should do it...

01:26:53.008 --> 01:26:55.978
[Meredith] You know what? That
really was a lovely vacation.

01:26:56.011 --> 01:26:58.247
[Burt]
I'm glad you liked it.

01:26:58.281 --> 01:27:04.353
[Meredith] How could I not? And I knew
that you would. You said so yourself.

01:27:04.387 --> 01:27:06.355
[Burt]
I can't believe you figured out...

01:27:06.389 --> 01:27:08.924
[Meredith] Yep. You two aren't the
only curious ones in the family.

01:27:08.957 --> 01:27:11.660
I put the book on the bookshelf
so that Annabelle could find it

01:27:11.694 --> 01:27:13.996
and continue where you left off.

01:27:14.029 --> 01:27:19.268
[Burt] So she could try to solve
the mystery that I never could.

01:27:19.302 --> 01:27:21.304
Thank you.

01:27:23.306 --> 01:27:27.410
[Maddi] So let's see. Solve a
200 year old mystery. Check.

01:27:27.443 --> 01:27:30.012
Save a family doomed to be
separated for all of eternity.

01:27:30.045 --> 01:27:33.048
Check. Save an island and
possibly all of humanity from

01:27:33.081 --> 01:27:36.552
enslavement by a nefarious
criminal masterminds. Check.

01:27:36.585 --> 01:27:39.955
I'd say not bad for one summer vacation.

01:27:39.988 --> 01:27:42.858
What's wrong?

01:27:42.891 --> 01:27:44.927
[Annabelle]
Just thinking...

01:27:44.960 --> 01:27:47.896
[Maddi]
About what?

01:27:47.930 --> 01:27:51.300
[Annabelle] When Billy first followed
Argyle and Tweed, he said he heard

01:27:51.334 --> 01:27:54.537
them mention working for
someone called "The Curator."

01:27:54.570 --> 01:27:58.741
[Maddi] The Curator? You mean
they weren't working alone?

01:27:58.774 --> 01:28:00.709
[Annabelle]
Maybe not.

01:28:00.743 --> 01:28:02.478
[Jake] I did think it was weird
that two guys like that could even

01:28:02.511 --> 01:28:04.680
come up with a decent plan.

01:28:06.749 --> 01:28:12.020
[Annabelle]
And if he does exist

01:28:12.054 --> 01:28:15.358
he's still out there.

01:28:18.461 --> 01:28:23.599
[Annabelle V.O.] The vacation might
be over, but the real story? Hmm...

01:28:23.632 --> 01:28:26.301
Well, that's just begun...
