WEBVTT

00:05.214 --> 00:07.174
- When are you guys
- gonna be finished?

00:07.216 --> 00:09.802
We wanna use the table.

00:09.844 --> 00:12.306
Zuri, chess is a noble game

00:12.307 --> 00:14.766
of strategy and patience.

00:14.807 --> 00:16.643
We could be here for hours,

00:16.644 --> 00:18.477
days, even weeks.

00:18.519 --> 00:20.271
Ugh! I'm out.

00:22.147 --> 00:23.670
Finally! You know,

00:23.671 --> 00:25.192
you could have

00:22.147 --> 00:25.192
won five minutes ago.

00:25.234 --> 00:27.027
- And what makes you
- say that?

00:27.069 --> 00:28.237
If you would've moved

00:28.238 --> 00:29.405
your horsey to that space,

00:29.447 --> 00:30.532
he would've

00:30.533 --> 00:31.616
had to move

00:29.447 --> 00:31.616
his castle here,

00:31.657 --> 00:33.201
which would've left him open

00:33.202 --> 00:34.744
for one royal butt-whoopin'.

00:34.786 --> 00:36.412
Dear Gods,

00:36.413 --> 00:38.038
you are correct!

00:38.080 --> 00:39.623
Whoa. Zuri,

00:39.624 --> 00:41.166
how do you know

00:38.080 --> 00:41.166
so much about chess?

00:41.208 --> 00:42.501
I dunno.

00:42.543 --> 00:43.544
I just picked it up while

00:43.545 --> 00:44.545
I was waiting for you.

00:45.838 --> 00:46.923
What?

00:46.924 --> 00:48.007
Like it's hard?

00:48.048 --> 00:50.093
Well then, perhaps you might

00:50.094 --> 00:52.136
care to test your luck

00:48.048 --> 00:52.136
against a master.

00:53.638 --> 00:55.097
Or I could play you.

00:57.266 --> 00:58.935
What I do not get is

00:58.936 --> 01:00.603
how you were able

00:57.266 --> 01:00.603
to think so far ahead.

01:00.645 --> 01:02.334
It's easy. Like when

01:02.335 --> 01:04.022
I want to stay up

01:00.645 --> 01:04.022
past my bedtime.

01:04.063 --> 01:05.649
At breakfast,

01:05.650 --> 01:07.234
I tell Jessie she's

01:04.063 --> 01:07.234
the best nanny ever,

01:07.276 --> 01:08.778
then I give her

01:08.779 --> 01:10.279
some lame gift

01:07.276 --> 01:10.279
I made in art class,

01:10.321 --> 01:12.198
and bam! I'm up late

01:12.199 --> 01:14.074
watching TV.

01:14.116 --> 01:16.285
Hey, I thought you made me

01:16.286 --> 01:18.454
that dream catcher

01:14.116 --> 01:18.454
because you love me.

01:18.496 --> 01:19.810
I do.

01:19.811 --> 01:21.123
I also love

01:18.496 --> 01:21.123
Charlie Rose.

01:23.250 --> 01:24.585
- What do you say
- when you win?

01:24.627 --> 01:26.253
Well, if you were to win,

01:26.295 --> 01:28.213
(SCOFFS) which is unlikely,

01:28.255 --> 01:29.486
you would say,

01:29.487 --> 01:30.716
"Checkmate."

01:30.758 --> 01:31.822
That's lame.

01:31.823 --> 01:32.885
I'm going with,

01:33.511 --> 01:35.179
"You lose, sucka!"

01:38.307 --> 01:39.809
- You gotta admit,
- that is catchier.

a priceless diamond

the Scuba Bandit

02:57.469 --> 02:58.655
- Here is a computer

- Of what he would
- look like today.

03:00.264 --> 03:01.745
Hey. That picture

kind of reminds me of...

Here is what

03:04.499 --> 03:05.728
investigators believe

03:03.267 --> 03:05.728
he would look like

- if he spent the
- last 25 years

03:07.312 --> 03:08.377

(GASPS) Bertram!

He's the Scuba Bandit!

03:14.403 --> 03:15.676
That picture

03:15.677 --> 03:16.948
looks just like him.

03:16.989 --> 03:18.637
So does a walrus.

03:18.638 --> 03:20.284
That doesn't mean

03:16.989 --> 03:20.284
he's a master criminal.

03:23.454 --> 03:25.414
Bertram,

03:25.415 --> 03:27.374
totally random question.

03:27.416 --> 03:28.773
Where were you on the night

03:28.774 --> 03:30.128
of August 12, 1987?

03:31.921 --> 03:33.798
- Well, you kids
- weren't born yet,

03:33.839 --> 03:35.133
So I was probably

03:35.134 --> 03:36.425
someplace being happy.

03:38.052 --> 03:39.721
I was just curious

03:39.722 --> 03:41.388
what you did before

03:38.052 --> 03:41.388
you came to work for us.

03:41.430 --> 03:42.431
I'll tell you one thing.

03:42.473 --> 03:44.391
- I had a lot less
- acid reflux.

03:48.437 --> 03:50.314
- Luke,
- did you hear that?

03:50.355 --> 03:51.983
- He was ducking
- my questions!

03:52.024 --> 03:53.089
That proves Bertram

03:53.090 --> 03:54.152
is the Scuba Bandit!

03:54.568 --> 03:56.278
Why?

03:56.320 --> 03:58.173
- Just because - he can't remember
- What he was doing

03:58.197 --> 03:59.198
On some random day

03:59.199 --> 04:00.199
25 years ago?

04:00.240 --> 04:02.409
You're being stupid.

04:02.451 --> 04:04.058
Said the boy

04:04.059 --> 04:05.663
who thought eggplants

04:02.451 --> 04:05.663
came from planting eggs.

04:12.003 --> 04:13.629
Man, what is up

04:13.630 --> 04:15.255
with the nerd herd

04:12.003 --> 04:15.255
in the park today?

04:16.548 --> 04:18.466
Hmm.

04:18.509 --> 04:19.510
They are signing up

04:19.511 --> 04:20.511
for the Central Park

04:18.509 --> 04:20.511
Chess Tournament.

04:20.552 --> 04:22.096
The prize is two

04:22.096 --> 04:23.639
first-class tickets

04:20.552 --> 04:23.639
to Paris.

04:23.681 --> 04:25.245
Paris? That's the most

04:25.246 --> 04:26.809
romantic city in the world!

04:26.851 --> 04:28.491
- It's always been
- my dream to go there.

(SHUSHING)

04:30.312 --> 04:31.418
(FRENCH ACCENT)

04:31.419 --> 04:32.523

04:32.564 --> 04:34.359
Now, make like a mime

04:34.360 --> 04:36.152
and shut your pie hole!

04:37.444 --> 04:39.802
Well, on behalf

04:39.803 --> 04:42.158
of me and mimes

04:37.444 --> 04:42.158
everywhere...

04:42.200 --> 04:44.139
You know what, Jessie?

04:44.140 --> 04:46.078
I'm going to win

04:42.200 --> 04:46.078
that trip for you.

04:46.120 --> 04:47.454
You deserve a vacation.

04:47.496 --> 04:48.915
And I deserve

04:48.916 --> 04:50.332
a nice break from school.

04:51.291 --> 04:53.335
That is Clement Brulee.

04:53.377 --> 04:55.337
- He is the best player
- in Central Park.

04:55.379 --> 04:57.027
Zuri does not

04:57.028 --> 04:58.674
stand a chance

04:55.379 --> 04:58.674
against him.

04:58.716 --> 04:59.842
I think the girl

04:59.843 --> 05:00.968
with the loud hair

05:01.010 --> 05:03.241
would do well to listen

05:03.242 --> 05:05.472
to the boy in the loud shirt.

- going to enter,

05:10.269 --> 05:12.164
- And she's going to beat
- the baguette out of you!

05:12.188 --> 05:13.939
You bet your beret I am!

05:13.981 --> 05:15.774
Mmm. That's right.

05:15.816 --> 05:17.110
She's going to practice

05:17.111 --> 05:18.402
every single second until

05:15.816 --> 05:18.402
that competition.

05:18.443 --> 05:19.778
I am?

05:19.820 --> 05:21.780
- But tonight Charlie Rose
- is interviewing

05:21.822 --> 05:23.219

05:23.220 --> 05:24.616

05:21.822 --> 05:24.616

05:31.331 --> 05:32.354

05:32.355 --> 05:33.375
the Scuba Bandit,

05:33.417 --> 05:35.544
I'll kiss Mrs. Kipling.

05:38.714 --> 05:40.070
(SOFTLY) Better pucker up

05:40.071 --> 05:41.425
and get some breath spray.

05:42.342 --> 05:43.761
- Bertram!
- Oh!

05:43.802 --> 05:45.637
What are you doing?

05:45.679 --> 05:46.806
This is how

05:46.807 --> 05:47.932
I always clean Luke's room.

05:47.973 --> 05:49.725
The air is dangerous.

05:49.767 --> 05:51.227
Last time I went

05:51.228 --> 05:52.686
in there unprotected,

05:49.767 --> 05:52.686
I woke up three days later,

05:52.728 --> 05:54.980
and I could hear colors.

05:55.022 --> 05:56.523
- Wait, that's
- not normal?

05:58.442 --> 05:59.568
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

06:02.446 --> 06:04.094
I can't believe it,

06:04.095 --> 06:05.741
but you might be right!

06:05.783 --> 06:07.285
I also can't believe

06:07.286 --> 06:08.786
my first kiss is gonna be

06:05.783 --> 06:08.786
with a reptile.

06:10.370 --> 06:11.496
I can.

06:18.254 --> 06:20.152
Guys, Bertram

06:20.153 --> 06:22.049
is way too lazy

06:18.254 --> 06:22.049
to be a jewel thief!

06:22.091 --> 06:23.568
- He does so little work
- around here,

06:23.592 --> 06:25.115
The only thing

06:25.116 --> 06:26.637
he's guilty of stealing

06:23.592 --> 06:26.637
is a paycheck.

06:26.678 --> 06:28.535
Oh, yeah? What do you

06:28.536 --> 06:30.390
think about this?

06:30.432 --> 06:32.244
- Well, it doesn't really - go
with what you're - Wearing, but...

06:32.268 --> 06:34.519
No!

06:34.561 --> 06:36.063
- I found it
- in Bertram's room,

06:36.105 --> 06:37.481
- Behind his collection
- of onions

06:37.522 --> 06:39.442
- That look like - The Three Tenors.
- I don't...

06:41.319 --> 06:42.738
Jessie, you have

06:42.739 --> 06:44.155
to call the fuzz right now

06:44.196 --> 06:45.615
and tell 'em

06:45.616 --> 06:47.032
we just blew

06:44.196 --> 06:47.032
the lid clean off this caper!

06:47.074 --> 06:48.638
Hold it, Mugsy.

06:48.639 --> 06:50.202
Just because Bertram

06:47.074 --> 06:50.202
had that necklace in his room

06:50.244 --> 06:52.163
- doesn't mean
- he's a criminal.

06:52.204 --> 06:53.685
- The man could
- just like his bling.

06:54.832 --> 06:56.458
Well, here's more proof.

06:56.500 --> 06:58.543
Look what I found online.

06:58.585 --> 06:59.963
"When the Scuba Bandit

06:59.964 --> 07:01.339
dove off the yacht

06:58.585 --> 07:01.339
with the jewels,

07:01.380 --> 07:02.444
"a passenger spotted

07:02.445 --> 07:03.507
a heart-shaped birthmark

07:03.548 --> 07:05.467
- "on the bottom
- of his right foot."

07:05.509 --> 07:07.261
Okay, so?

07:07.303 --> 07:08.784
So, all we have to do

07:08.785 --> 07:10.264
is trick Bertram

07:07.303 --> 07:10.264
into removing his shoes

07:10.306 --> 07:11.432
and see if he has

07:11.433 --> 07:12.557
the same birthmark.

07:12.599 --> 07:13.725
Are you with us?

07:13.767 --> 07:15.477
(SCOFFS) Not a chance.

07:15.519 --> 07:17.455
- A world where - I look at Bertram's feet
- On purpose

07:17.479 --> 07:19.315
- Is a world
- I don't want to live in.

07:23.527 --> 07:24.737
Ravi, I have

07:24.738 --> 07:25.946
some exciting

chess news!

07:25.988 --> 07:28.115
Ha! There's one sentence

07:28.116 --> 07:30.242
that's never been

07:25.988 --> 07:30.242
spoken before.

07:30.284 --> 07:32.205
- I spoke to - the Central Park
- Chess Committee

07:32.244 --> 07:34.181
- And got you a job - as the emcee
- Of the tournament!

07:34.205 --> 07:35.727
(SQUEALS) Really?

07:35.728 --> 07:37.249
That is amazing, Jessie!

07:34.205 --> 07:37.249
Thank you!

07:37.291 --> 07:38.667
(LAUGHS)

07:38.709 --> 07:40.478
- And they'll be - broadcasting
- Over the Internet

07:40.502 --> 07:41.503
To literally dozens

07:41.504 --> 07:42.504
of people!

07:42.546 --> 07:44.382
(GASPS)

07:44.423 --> 07:45.967
How did you convince them

07:45.968 --> 07:47.509
that I was the right man

07:44.423 --> 07:47.509
for the job?

07:47.551 --> 07:49.449
Oh, it was easy.

07:49.450 --> 07:51.347
Apparently, you really appeal

07:47.551 --> 07:51.347
to their target demographic.

07:51.389 --> 07:53.640
Smart and sophisticated?

07:53.682 --> 07:55.475
Young and nerdy.

07:55.517 --> 07:56.602
Right now the average age

07:56.603 --> 07:57.686
of most of their fans is...

07:57.728 --> 07:59.188
Well, dead.

08:04.484 --> 08:06.112
Now's our chance

08:06.113 --> 08:07.738
to find out for sure if

08:04.484 --> 08:07.738
Bertram is the Scuba Bandit.

08:07.779 --> 08:09.614
- We just have
- to be subtle.

08:09.656 --> 08:11.242
Got it.

08:11.283 --> 08:12.492
(ROARING) Charge!

08:13.118 --> 08:14.119
(EXCLAIMING)

08:16.580 --> 08:18.623
Unhand my foot!

08:18.665 --> 08:20.334
Luke! If I've told you once,

08:20.335 --> 08:22.002
I've told you

08:18.665 --> 08:22.002
a thousand times.

08:22.044 --> 08:23.795
- Tackle the Butler
- is an outdoor game!

08:24.422 --> 08:26.131
Aha!

08:26.173 --> 08:27.341
Jessie, look!

08:27.342 --> 08:28.508
Can you believe it?

08:28.550 --> 08:30.528
- Believe what? - Bertram has so much
- Hair on his foot

08:30.552 --> 08:31.678
- He could be
- a hobbit?

08:32.929 --> 08:34.182
No! It's the heart-shaped

08:34.183 --> 08:35.433
birthmark!

08:35.474 --> 08:37.434
- Bertram is
- the Scuba Bandit!

08:37.476 --> 08:39.811
What? No, I'm not!

08:39.852 --> 08:41.417
Then how do you explain

08:41.418 --> 08:42.981
that mysterious birthmark

08:39.852 --> 08:42.981
on your foot?

08:43.023 --> 08:45.109
That's not a birthmark.

08:45.150 --> 08:46.652
It's a scar from

08:46.653 --> 08:48.153
stepping on a glass

08:45.150 --> 08:48.153
that Luke broke

08:48.195 --> 08:50.572
and never cleaned up!

08:50.614 --> 08:52.408
Huh. That does

08:52.409 --> 08:54.201
sounds like me.

08:54.243 --> 08:55.452
Then what about

08:55.453 --> 08:56.661
this priceless necklace

08:54.243 --> 08:56.661
Luke found in your room?

08:56.703 --> 08:58.122
That's a birthday present

08:58.123 --> 08:59.539
for my mother!

08:59.581 --> 09:01.562
And it's not priceless.

09:01.563 --> 09:03.543
It's a knock-off I bought

08:59.581 --> 09:03.543
from a guy on Canal Street,

09:03.585 --> 09:05.504
Larry Winston.

09:05.545 --> 09:07.423
- Ugh! I bought a bracelet
- from him once,

09:07.465 --> 09:08.745
- It turned
- my whole arm green.

09:10.426 --> 09:12.783
You kids need

09:12.784 --> 09:15.139
to stay out of my room,

09:10.426 --> 09:15.139
and out of my business!

09:15.180 --> 09:16.203
Can't you control

09:16.204 --> 09:17.224
these hooligans?

09:17.266 --> 09:18.642
You are the world's

09:18.643 --> 09:20.018
worst nanny!

09:20.060 --> 09:21.521
Okay, just because

09:21.522 --> 09:22.980
it says that on the coffee mug

09:20.060 --> 09:22.980
you got me for Christmas

09:23.021 --> 09:24.648
doesn't make it true!

09:27.151 --> 09:28.568
What's all this?

09:28.610 --> 09:30.258
A special tea party

09:30.259 --> 09:31.905
for Chubbs.

09:31.947 --> 09:33.053
I don't play with him

09:33.054 --> 09:34.158
for 24 hours,

09:34.199 --> 09:36.035
and suddenly he thinks

09:36.036 --> 09:37.869
I'm not invested

09:34.199 --> 09:37.869
in our relationship.

09:39.121 --> 09:40.747
- But the chess tournament
- is tomorrow.

09:40.789 --> 09:42.458
You should be practicing.

09:42.500 --> 09:43.960
Jessie, I want to win

09:43.961 --> 09:45.419
that trip to Paris for you,

09:45.461 --> 09:47.776
but I don't want

09:47.777 --> 09:50.090
to spend all day playing

09:45.461 --> 09:50.090
checkers' snobby cousin.

09:50.132 --> 09:51.734
- But think about
- all the fun we'll have!

09:51.758 --> 09:52.969
We'll see the Eiffel Tower,

09:52.970 --> 09:54.178
and the Louvre,

09:54.219 --> 09:55.554
and the Eiffel Tower...

09:55.595 --> 09:56.555
You already said that.

09:56.596 --> 09:57.890
I don't know much

09:57.891 --> 09:59.183
about Paris.

09:59.224 --> 10:01.310
- But that's why I want to go!
- So come practice!

10:01.935 --> 10:03.728
Sorry, Chubbs!

10:03.770 --> 10:05.189
Now he's going

10:05.190 --> 10:06.606
to withhold cuddling

10:03.770 --> 10:06.606
until I apologize!

10:10.944 --> 10:12.779
- EMMA: Why is it
- so dark in here?

10:15.324 --> 10:16.992
(SCREAMING)

10:17.034 --> 10:18.994
Bertram?

10:18.995 --> 10:20.954
Don't you mean

10:17.034 --> 10:20.954
the Scuba Bandit?

10:21.663 --> 10:23.499
It was you!

10:23.541 --> 10:24.583
I told you!

10:26.084 --> 10:27.440
I always knew you kids'd

10:27.441 --> 10:28.795
find me out eventually.

10:28.837 --> 10:30.917
- I just thought it would be
- one of the smart ones.

10:32.799 --> 10:34.676
Hey!

10:34.718 --> 10:36.053
- Actually,
- that's fair.

10:38.305 --> 10:39.473
I started

10:39.474 --> 10:40.640
my life of crime

10:38.305 --> 10:40.640
when I was three.

10:40.682 --> 10:42.309
- Stole another kid's
- pacifier,

10:42.351 --> 10:44.541
And became known

10:44.542 --> 10:46.730
as the Binky Burglar.

10:46.771 --> 10:49.233
Now, if you kids

10:49.234 --> 10:51.693
don't want to get arrested

10:46.771 --> 10:51.693
for harboring a fugitive,

10:51.735 --> 10:53.133
you're going to help me

10:53.134 --> 10:54.530
rob the jewelry store

10:51.735 --> 10:54.530
across the street.

10:54.572 --> 10:56.532
Why do you need us?

10:56.574 --> 10:58.700
- Because my days of
- crawling through tiny vents

10:58.742 --> 11:00.223
Are 25 years

11:00.224 --> 11:01.703
and 2,500 baby back ribs ago.

11:03.747 --> 11:04.999
But we've

11:05.000 --> 11:06.250
never stolen anything

11:03.747 --> 11:06.250
in our lives!

11:07.626 --> 11:08.753
I've never stolen

11:08.754 --> 11:09.878
anything in my life!

11:12.631 --> 11:14.091
Don't worry,

11:14.132 --> 11:16.031
I'm gonna give you kids

11:16.032 --> 11:17.928
a crash course in thievery.

11:17.969 --> 11:19.951
Now, meet me tomorrow

11:19.952 --> 11:21.932
in the living room,

11:22.766 --> 11:24.476
or else.

11:24.518 --> 11:28.606
(LAUGHING MANIACALLY)

11:29.649 --> 11:30.649
(SCREAMING)

11:30.690 --> 11:31.901
BERTRAM: And keep

11:31.902 --> 11:33.110
your stuff off the stairs!

11:34.612 --> 11:35.737
(MOANING)

11:40.451 --> 11:42.994
You, pawn!

11:43.036 --> 11:44.559
(SCOLDING) Why

11:44.560 --> 11:46.081
aren't you practicing?

11:46.123 --> 11:47.145
You must defeat

11:47.146 --> 11:48.166
the evil king

11:48.208 --> 11:49.522
so your queen

11:49.523 --> 11:50.835
can get to Paris.

11:50.877 --> 11:52.671
- I want to meet some
- cute French guys!

11:54.047 --> 11:55.424
Ooh, la, la!

11:56.216 --> 11:57.551
Don't tell the bishop.

11:58.636 --> 12:00.178
- I'm sorry,
- Your Highness,

12:00.220 --> 12:01.326
I was just playing

12:01.327 --> 12:02.431
with Chubby the Bear.

12:02.473 --> 12:04.079
No! So long, Chubby!

12:04.080 --> 12:05.684
Time to hibernate!

12:05.725 --> 12:07.686
No!

12:07.727 --> 12:08.791
I don't wanna

12:08.792 --> 12:09.854
play chess anymore!

12:09.896 --> 12:11.398
Stop her!

12:11.856 --> 12:13.108
Halt!

12:13.150 --> 12:14.443
(MIMICS NEIGHING)

12:15.777 --> 12:17.758
Get thee to your board

12:17.759 --> 12:19.739
or it is off with your head!

12:19.781 --> 12:22.075
No! Stop it! Please!

12:23.743 --> 12:25.078
I command you,

12:25.120 --> 12:27.456
show me your moves!

12:29.040 --> 12:31.751
Not you two! Her!

12:34.838 --> 12:35.943
Is that the best

12:35.944 --> 12:37.048
you can do?

12:37.090 --> 12:39.551
(SCREAMING)

12:40.427 --> 12:42.680
Zuri, what is the matter?

12:42.721 --> 12:44.182
I just had a terrible

12:44.183 --> 12:45.641
chess nightmare.

12:45.683 --> 12:47.434
- Jessie was dressed
- as the queen

12:47.476 --> 12:48.540
And she was putting

12:48.541 --> 12:49.603
all this pressure on me

12:49.645 --> 12:51.563
- to win her
- that trip to Paris.

12:51.605 --> 12:53.190
- What do you think
- that means?

12:55.150 --> 12:57.527
Well, a dream like that

12:57.528 --> 12:59.904
can be interpreted

12:55.150 --> 12:59.904
many different ways.

12:59.946 --> 13:01.740
- Really?
- No!

13:03.783 --> 13:05.347
It is clear that Jessie

13:05.348 --> 13:06.911
is freaking you out.

13:06.953 --> 13:08.455
Perhaps

13:08.456 --> 13:09.956
you should withdraw

13:06.953 --> 13:09.956
from the tournament.

13:09.998 --> 13:11.124
But that trip

13:11.125 --> 13:12.250
means so much to her.

13:12.292 --> 13:13.689
I can't let her down.

13:13.690 --> 13:15.086
That's Luke's job.

13:17.839 --> 13:19.675
- Then all you can do
- is try your best,

13:19.717 --> 13:20.759
And let the pawns

13:20.760 --> 13:21.801
fall where they may.

13:22.594 --> 13:24.638
Yeah, I guess you're right.

13:24.680 --> 13:26.139
Thanks, Ravi.

13:26.181 --> 13:27.807
- Night!
- Night, Zuri.

13:29.727 --> 13:31.811
(RAVI SCREAMING)

13:31.853 --> 13:33.605
What's wrong?

13:33.647 --> 13:34.732
Every once in a while,

13:34.733 --> 13:35.815
it slips my mind

13:35.857 --> 13:37.400
that I have a giant,

13:37.401 --> 13:38.943
man-eating lizard in my room.

13:44.824 --> 13:46.014
This is burglary

13:46.015 --> 13:47.202
boot camp.

13:47.244 --> 13:49.142
Your mission is to steal

13:49.143 --> 13:51.039
that necklace on the terrace

13:47.244 --> 13:51.039
in under one minute.

13:51.081 --> 13:52.082
Ready, set, go!

(GROANS)

13:56.420 --> 13:58.088
Hey, watch it!

13:59.464 --> 14:00.841
Oh, no! Guard dogs!

14:00.842 --> 14:02.217
Guard dogs!

13:59.464 --> 14:02.217
Guard dogs!

14:03.427 --> 14:04.928
- Quick, quick,
- through the vents!

14:05.887 --> 14:06.888
Okay, hurry,

14:06.889 --> 14:07.889
through the laser grid!

(ALARM BLARING)

14:15.230 --> 14:16.649
Time's up!

14:16.650 --> 14:18.066
That was pathetic.

14:18.108 --> 14:19.443
You're not good

14:19.444 --> 14:20.778
at school or crime?

14:20.819 --> 14:22.362
- It's a good thing
- you're rich.

14:26.950 --> 14:28.910
Check it out!

14:28.911 --> 14:30.870
I got us matching berets

14:26.950 --> 14:30.870
for our trip to Paris!

14:30.912 --> 14:33.144
After the tournament,

14:33.145 --> 14:35.375
everyone will be wishing us,

14:30.912 --> 14:35.375
"Bon fromage!"

14:35.417 --> 14:36.960
Why would they wish us,

14:36.961 --> 14:38.503
"Good cheese"?

14:38.545 --> 14:40.443
Whatever. I'll have plenty

14:40.444 --> 14:42.340
of time to practice my French

14:38.545 --> 14:42.340
on the way over there.

14:42.382 --> 14:43.613
What makes you

14:43.614 --> 14:44.843
so sure about that?

14:44.884 --> 14:46.386
Well, it's a long flight

14:46.387 --> 14:47.887
and I have this great

14:44.884 --> 14:47.887
new translating app.

14:47.929 --> 14:49.181
No, I meant about

14:49.182 --> 14:50.432
the little one winning.

14:50.474 --> 14:52.017
You have a better chance of

14:52.018 --> 14:53.560
making a "best dressed" list

14:53.602 --> 14:54.853
- than she does
- of beating me.

14:57.648 --> 14:59.629
Welcome to the Central Park

14:59.630 --> 15:01.610

15:01.652 --> 15:03.112
I am your handsome host,

15:03.113 --> 15:04.571
Ravi K. Ross.

15:04.613 --> 15:07.261
I will be your guide through

15:07.262 --> 15:09.909
this white-knuckled world

15:04.613 --> 15:09.909
of sitting and thinking!
