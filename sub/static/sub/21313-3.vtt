WEBVTT

00:47.500 --> 00:48.580
Here's what I don't get.

00:48.670 --> 00:50.831
We paid you to put this stuff
inside the house.

00:50.920 --> 00:52.296
It's of no use to me out here.

00:52.380 --> 00:55.178
Like I said before, sir,
we weren't contracted to move

00:55.260 --> 00:57.080
-anyone else's furniture out.
-Right, "contracted."

00:57.180 --> 00:58.249
In the history of moving,

00:58.350 --> 01:01.501
have you ever been contracted
to drop someone's shit on the front yard?

01:01.600 --> 01:02.840
-Marty.
-Work with me.

01:02.930 --> 01:04.557
They forgot the toy chest.

01:04.640 --> 01:05.720
The what?

01:05.810 --> 01:08.301
Charlotte's toy chest.
The one I made her.

01:08.400 --> 01:10.812
How is that a priority? Okay?

01:10.900 --> 01:12.470
Sir! I want you to give me one example.

01:12.570 --> 01:15.357
I want you to tell me one example
of someone who said,

01:15.450 --> 01:17.270
"We'd like you to take
everything that we own

01:17.360 --> 01:18.566
and dump it on our front lawn.

01:18.660 --> 01:21.117
Make sure you don't put anything
on the inside of the house."

01:21.200 --> 01:22.986
Give me one example of that,
and I'll drop it.

01:24.330 --> 01:26.241
Right. Can't do it. It's never happened.

01:26.330 --> 01:27.911
Ma'am, there's a number on the receipt.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.377
-You can file a claim.
-Thank you. I will.

01:30.460 --> 01:32.701
-That's it, you're just gonna leave now?
-Yep.

01:32.800 --> 01:33.789
- Dick.
- Great.

01:33.880 --> 01:36.041
-We'll move it in ourselves, I guess.
-Do you--

01:36.130 --> 01:37.791
Supposed to be
in the fucking service business!

01:37.880 --> 01:39.427
- Just calm down.

01:39.510 --> 01:42.252
-Why should I calm down?
-Because you're gonna scare the kids.

01:43.520 --> 01:46.671
At least I didn't tell them their father
launders money for a drug cartel.

01:46.770 --> 01:48.897
Okay, you wanna get into this
right here, right now?

01:48.980 --> 01:50.516
Marty! Wendy!

02:02.410 --> 02:03.946
All right, well...

02:05.450 --> 02:07.702
Everybody grab a box. Let's go.

02:30.270 --> 02:31.897
Okay, kids, if you're not gonna help,

02:31.980 --> 02:35.438
let's just go over what you're gonna say
when somebody asks you why you're here.

02:35.530 --> 02:37.737
-How about that?
-Charlotte, come over here, please.

02:37.820 --> 02:39.526
Pretty comfortable in my driveway bed.

02:39.610 --> 02:41.737
-Charlotte.
-Over here right now, please.

02:41.820 --> 02:42.809
This is important.

02:42.910 --> 02:45.117
What do you say when somebody asks
what you're doing here?

02:45.200 --> 02:46.827
We bought a resort called the Blue Cat.

02:46.910 --> 02:49.572
That's exactly right.
We bought a resort called the Blue Cat.

02:49.660 --> 02:51.412
And while I'm there today doing my job,

02:51.500 --> 02:54.037
your job is to get your boxes
up into your rooms.

02:54.130 --> 02:55.620
-Okay?
-What's Wendy's job?

02:55.710 --> 02:56.790
Getting groceries.

02:56.880 --> 02:59.838
If you don't like your jobs,
you're free to go find a real job

02:59.920 --> 03:01.080
and help out the family.

03:01.630 --> 03:03.712
-How long are we here?
-Is your cartel after us?

03:03.800 --> 03:06.132
It is not my cartel,
and no one is after us, pal.

03:06.220 --> 03:08.131
Uh, hopefully,
we're only here a few months.

03:13.940 --> 03:15.896
Why did you tell us
the real reason we're here?

03:17.900 --> 03:20.448
-Because you're too smart for bullshit.
-Please don't pander.

03:20.530 --> 03:21.485
I'm not pandering.

03:21.570 --> 03:23.697
You both have a right to know
why your lives were uprooted,

03:23.780 --> 03:25.190
and the more you know,
the safer you'll be.

03:25.280 --> 03:27.942
Is it? Or is it 'cause you wanted us
to turn on Marty here?

03:32.080 --> 03:33.820
You know, I found bus fares.

03:33.920 --> 03:35.376
Caitlin said I could live with them--

03:35.460 --> 03:37.291
- That's never gonna happen.
- No, ma'am.

03:37.380 --> 03:38.916
Her mother drinks every day.

03:47.930 --> 03:49.386
But you are laundering money.

03:50.480 --> 03:53.802
I'm... I'm helping people, uh,
get their money back into the bank

03:53.900 --> 03:55.720
- so they can pay their taxes.

03:55.810 --> 03:57.266
I got a job interview.

03:58.020 --> 04:00.238
-What? How?
-Technology.

04:02.400 --> 04:04.231
-I'll give you a ride.
-No, thanks, I can Uber.

04:04.320 --> 04:06.732
Wendy, you know, you can
borrow the minivan for the groceries,

04:06.820 --> 04:08.401
and I can use Buddy's car out back.

04:08.490 --> 04:10.993
- Do either of you want anything?
- Yeah.

04:11.080 --> 04:13.537
Maybe you could pick up
some pistachio ice cream?

04:14.080 --> 04:14.990
Organic, please?

04:19.670 --> 04:21.376
Oh, shit. There's no Uber.

04:21.460 --> 04:24.338
I'm happy to give you a ride when
I'm done with my day, if you can wait.

04:24.430 --> 04:25.636
Now, listen...

04:25.720 --> 04:28.848
I know this is a bad situation. I get it.
But we're all in this together.

04:28.930 --> 04:30.921
We're gonna suck it up.
Whining's not gonna help.

04:31.020 --> 04:32.419
That's your pep talk?

04:32.520 --> 04:34.886
That's my pep talk. Also, grab a box.

04:48.950 --> 04:50.156
You gotta be kidding me.

04:50.240 --> 04:54.324
If I was kidding,
I would've said you're witty and handsome.

04:55.420 --> 04:56.864
You can't do that!

04:56.960 --> 04:58.700
-Watch me.
-What the fuck?

04:58.790 --> 05:02.089
- Russ! _
- Now, Ruth, we were all Involved.

05:02.170 --> 05:04.411
We should at least get our cut.
It's just fair.

05:04.510 --> 05:07.889
You spent $900
on Jack Daniel's and fireworks.

05:07.970 --> 05:09.881
And for the record, life's not fair.

05:09.970 --> 05:13.804
You'll be thanking me when I parlay that
coin into a better roof over our heads.

05:13.890 --> 05:15.596
You're missing the big picture.

05:15.690 --> 05:18.762
She's not missing the big picture, Pops.
She just doesn't wanna waste it.

05:19.690 --> 05:20.679
Mm.

05:21.570 --> 05:23.140
Come July 3rd,

05:23.230 --> 05:27.234
every tourist on that lake's gonna be too
drunk or lazy to leave their Grady-White.

05:27.860 --> 05:30.772
Black Cats and bottle rockets
fetch double.

05:30.870 --> 05:35.489
Lady Fingers and inch-and-a-halfers
go times three.

05:35.580 --> 05:36.615
And the Jack?

05:37.170 --> 05:40.128
Predilection for sour mas_h
doesn't make a man stupid.

05:42.040 --> 05:44.452
Doesn't inspire confidence either.

05:47.840 --> 05:49.137
Point taken.

05:50.430 --> 05:51.590
Hmm.

05:55.020 --> 05:57.261
You know, you're not your daddy.

05:59.650 --> 06:00.719
That's right.

06:01.810 --> 06:05.735
And if Daddy were here, he would have
hung you out by your ball sack already.

06:07.650 --> 06:10.562
You want _me to tell him
that you're disrespectlng me?

06:14.450 --> 06:15.860
Didn't think so.

06:19.670 --> 06:22.582
Keep it shut about Byrdeman's eight mil.

06:23.040 --> 06:25.668
You don't wanna be
fighting the whole town for it.

06:36.520 --> 06:38.761
All she ever says, "I'm telling Daddy."

06:39.730 --> 06:42.096
-You brought him up.
-Well, fuck that.

06:44.610 --> 06:45.725
Don't start with that again.

06:45.820 --> 06:47.685
-I'm just saying--
-I know, I know.

06:47.780 --> 06:50.317
"There's gotta be a statute of limitations
about this shit."

06:50.400 --> 06:51.856
You're damn right there does.

06:52.620 --> 06:53.860
Fuck me.

07:02.580 --> 07:03.706
There you go.

07:23.400 --> 07:24.856
Good mornin'.

07:24.940 --> 07:27.477
Hey. The, uh, gas tanks are filled.

07:27.570 --> 07:29.936
-That's a waste.
-Why's that?

07:30.030 --> 07:33.238
Simple economics.
All supply, no demand.

07:33.320 --> 07:36.619
I'll worry about that.
It's a good song. Did you pick it?

07:36.700 --> 07:38.577
It's a Tuck specialty.

07:39.660 --> 07:41.651
There are easier ways
to take over a business

07:41.750 --> 07:43.320
than getting punched in the face.

07:43.420 --> 07:45.741
Well, that should tell you
something, shouldn't it?

07:45.840 --> 07:46.989
That you're a lousy fighter?

07:47.750 --> 07:52.164
That and, uh, I'm willing to do
whatever it takes. Okay?

07:52.260 --> 07:54.216
Long as it's in pleated pants.

07:55.010 --> 07:57.422
Uh, listen,
we need to increase traffic. Um...

07:58.350 --> 08:00.170
what do we have that no other place does?

08:00.270 --> 08:04.092
Uh, an investor that knows
absolutely nothing about the Ozarks.

08:05.060 --> 08:08.143
-And the cheapest gas.
-We don't have the cheapest gas.

08:08.230 --> 08:10.892
We do now, and it's our siren song.

08:10.990 --> 08:14.278
All the guests at the high-end resorts,
they get ferried around.

08:14.360 --> 08:16.988
So that's not our bread and butter.
What we're after...

08:17.830 --> 08:19.650
are the families
with the credit card debt.

08:19.740 --> 08:23.073
Every one of our competitors, they raise
their gas prices during the summer.

08:23.160 --> 08:24.957
It's the logical thing to do, yeah?

08:25.040 --> 08:26.496
We lower ours.

08:27.210 --> 08:28.950
And as we start to steal their traffic,

08:29.050 --> 08:31.792
maybe they lower theirs, too,
to keep pace.

08:31.880 --> 08:33.541
What do we do? We lower ours again,

08:33.630 --> 08:37.293
and we offer a burger and a beer
for ﬁve bucks with every fill-up.

08:37.390 --> 08:39.506
We buy the burgers at bulk
so we're still in profit.

08:39.600 --> 08:41.556
Saturdays, the busiest day of the week...

08:42.140 --> 08:43.380
while everyone's scrambling,

08:43.480 --> 08:47.143
we raise our price ten cents
while still keeping the burger deal.

08:47.230 --> 08:49.221
Sunday, we start the cycle all over again.

08:49.320 --> 08:52.278
Control the market. Yeah?
You win, I win, they win.

08:55.820 --> 08:56.946
Are you high?

08:57.910 --> 08:58.729
No.

08:59.370 --> 09:00.940
Your eyes, you look high.

09:01.540 --> 09:03.531
- Oh.

09:03.620 --> 09:04.860
I didn't sleep last night.

09:04.960 --> 09:07.281
Well, maybe listen to
one of your business lectures.

09:07.380 --> 09:08.870
That might do the trick.

09:09.460 --> 09:12.338
Burgers really five dollars
with a fill-up?

09:13.840 --> 09:15.250
Yes, sir.

09:18.340 --> 09:20.092
Uh, what'll you have to drink?

09:21.100 --> 09:23.466
Mm, Bud is ﬁne.

09:24.060 --> 09:26.597
Hmm. You guys doing some work
on the place?

09:26.690 --> 09:27.930
That's the word.

09:30.110 --> 09:31.008
Thanks.

09:33.990 --> 09:37.312
-- When the leaves are fallin'

09:38.570 --> 09:41.152
In the cold November

10:46.810 --> 10:49.688
Hey, Tuck?
There are other songs in there, pal.

10:49.770 --> 10:52.227
Please? Different number,
different letter.

10:53.610 --> 10:54.895
You owe me a job.

10:56.030 --> 10:58.351
-What?
-Am I speaking Greek?

10:59.240 --> 11:01.947
-You owe me a fucking job.
-How do you figure that?

11:02.030 --> 11:05.079
It's not tough.
You got me fired from the last one.

11:05.790 --> 11:07.906
You got yourself fired...

11:08.000 --> 11:11.618
when you stole from our room
under the guise of diligent service.

11:11.710 --> 11:12.950
Good bye.

11:17.880 --> 11:20.929
I'm not leaving without
gainful motherfucking employment.

11:22.930 --> 11:25.091
Why don't you use the 20 grand
that you took from me?

11:25.180 --> 11:26.465
That should supplement your welfare.

11:26.560 --> 11:28.630
-I'm not a welfare bum.
-No?

11:29.770 --> 11:31.886
There's a million other places
you could probably work.

11:31.980 --> 11:34.892
Not right before season. All staffed up.

11:34.980 --> 11:37.437
My daughter got an interview
in under three minutes.

11:37.520 --> 11:39.238
I doubt she got a rap sheet like mine.

11:39.320 --> 11:41.606
Boy, you say that with such pride.

11:41.700 --> 11:46.319
Listen, Martin... wouldn't you agree
that it's always a good idea

11:46.410 --> 11:48.480
to keep your friends close
and your enemies closer?

11:48.580 --> 11:51.492
Hey, you told your uncles to kill me.
Do you remember that?

11:52.500 --> 11:54.536
-You're here, aren't you?
-That's right, I am.

11:55.290 --> 11:58.418
Isn't it better having someone
working under you

11:58.500 --> 12:00.877
who knows all your dirty little deeds?

12:02.510 --> 12:04.501
I mean, if I were in your shoes,

12:04.590 --> 12:07.753
I'd sure as _shit rather have
someone like me nearby,

12:07.850 --> 12:10.307
instead of running my mouth
to every Tom, Dick and Harry

12:10.390 --> 12:13.018
about the eight million cash
you're swimming in.

12:13.100 --> 12:14.180
Someone could get ideas.

12:14.900 --> 12:18.188
Wanna take a little wade
in that big pool of yours.

12:19.440 --> 12:22.352
And then when it's over,
when it's all said and done...

12:22.950 --> 12:24.599
you'll find all your money's gone...

12:25.660 --> 12:30.404
and you're at the bottom,
with an anchor tied around your torso.

12:33.080 --> 12:34.411
In theory.

12:44.680 --> 12:45.999
Follow me.

12:51.180 --> 12:53.387
-What are we doing?
-Deposit this.

12:53.480 --> 12:55.380
-What? Why?
-Just do it.

12:58.440 --> 13:00.681
-Okay. Good.
-Good what?

13:01.480 --> 13:03.607
You, Ruth Langmore,
just committed an overt act.

13:04.650 --> 13:05.901
Wh-What the fuck's that?

13:06.450 --> 13:08.691
See this camera? It sees you.

13:09.580 --> 13:11.536
And it saw you just make that deposit.

13:14.710 --> 13:18.874
Now if I'm ever arrested for anything
having to do with that money,

13:18.960 --> 13:20.916
the fact that you just
made that deposit for me,

13:21.000 --> 13:22.877
the feds consider that an overt act.

13:22.960 --> 13:24.837
Makes you an accomplice.

13:24.920 --> 13:28.424
Simply put,
if I ever go to prison, so do you.

13:30.260 --> 13:31.921
Does that mean that I'm hired?

13:33.270 --> 13:36.262
You wanna wash dishes for minimum wage,
you can be my guest.

13:43.940 --> 13:45.646
And now, in local news,

13:45.740 --> 13:49.062
a man from Osage Beach was hurt
in a boating accident late last night

13:49.160 --> 13:52.072
near mile marker four off the Gravois Arm.

13:52.160 --> 13:56.324
According to the State Highway Patrol,
Henry Bullock sustained several injuries

13:56.410 --> 13:58.366
when his boat struck a commercial dock.

13:58.460 --> 14:01.918
Mr. Bullock was transported by ambulance
to Lake Regional Hospital,

14:02.000 --> 14:04.161
where he has been pronounced stable.

14:04.260 --> 14:06.546
The boat was severely damaged as well.

14:06.630 --> 14:09.042
And now to sports,
where the St. Louis Cardinals

14:09.130 --> 14:10.927
look to extend
their three-game wnnnlng streak

14:11.010 --> 14:13.171
- as they begin a...

14:14.020 --> 14:16.511
I will say,
"I will stand up for God!"

14:20.270 --> 14:23.512
Fucking kill myself.

14:28.910 --> 14:31.868
I know you're pissed at your mother,
but she still could've given you a ride.

14:31.950 --> 14:33.326
Don't worry, I am just as pissed at you.

14:33.410 --> 14:36.322
-But what Wendy did was wrong.
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

14:36.410 --> 14:37.786
I'm Dad, she's Mom.

14:37.870 --> 14:40.168
The first name business stops right now.
That understood?

14:41.170 --> 14:43.707
-And I want you to go easy on her.
-Why are you defending her?

14:44.670 --> 14:46.046
I'm sure you could tell us stuff.

14:46.130 --> 14:48.872
I mean, bad things she's done
that would poison us on her.

14:49.930 --> 14:52.421
-Am I right?
-Uh, Charlotte...

14:54.600 --> 14:55.749
- you're gonna be late.

14:55.850 --> 14:57.260
Hurry up. Get in there.

15:09.320 --> 15:11.106
This all sounds good.

15:14.660 --> 15:16.787
So, would you consider yourself
a self-starter?

15:16.870 --> 15:18.861
Yeah, deﬁnitely a self-starter, sure.

15:18.960 --> 15:20.951
And I'd say I have
leadership qualities, as well,

15:21.040 --> 15:22.610
but not to the point
where I'd undermine the boss,

15:22.710 --> 15:23.995
or suck the air out of the room.

15:24.090 --> 15:26.627
- Well, thank you.
- Yeah.

15:26.710 --> 15:28.257
Could you start this weekend?

15:29.220 --> 15:31.541
Uh, could you excuse me
for a moment, please?

15:36.510 --> 15:37.966
Oh, dude.

15:39.810 --> 15:41.596
On three, pop shove, right now.

15:42.560 --> 15:43.720
Hey!

15:51.360 --> 15:52.896
You just got hit by a girl!

15:56.990 --> 15:59.151
-Did I just see what I think I saw?
-Yep.

16:00.370 --> 16:02.361
- Good shot.

16:19.520 --> 16:20.976
You watching porn?

16:21.980 --> 16:23.015
No.

16:24.560 --> 16:25.891
Just kidding.

16:28.070 --> 16:30.561
Uh, you have any questions
about this morning?

16:32.110 --> 16:33.816
-No, I'm good.
-You sure?

16:34.950 --> 16:37.737
Okay. You know, if... if you do,
you can just ask.

16:38.660 --> 16:39.649
Yeah?

16:40.870 --> 16:41.939
Okay.

17:01.430 --> 17:04.137
Charlotte won't even
call us Mom and Dad.

17:04.230 --> 17:06.346
I've never hated the sound
of my own name more.

17:06.440 --> 17:09.011
You should've seen her when I told her
I couldn't get that ice cream.

17:09.110 --> 17:12.182
It was like Medusa.
I almost turned to stone.

17:12.940 --> 17:16.023
Most kids wish that their biggest worry
was ice cream.

17:16.110 --> 17:18.271
--But this isn't their biggest worry.

17:18.370 --> 17:20.770
Wendy, I'm on it, okay?
It's our worry, not theirs.

17:20.870 --> 17:22.485
No, it's all of our worry.

17:22.580 --> 17:24.821
You know this could mess them up for life.

17:24.910 --> 17:28.038
I just spoke to Jonah,
and... and he's fine.

17:28.130 --> 17:30.872
Besides, a little adversity isn't...
is not so terrible.

17:30.960 --> 17:32.086
-Adversity?
-Yeah.

17:32.170 --> 17:33.956
Did either of us grow up
with any advantages?

17:34.050 --> 17:37.258
Okay, this is not like
being picked last for dodgeball,

17:37.340 --> 17:38.830
-or failing a class.
-I'm not saying that.

17:38.930 --> 17:41.501
Oh, Jesus Christ, Marty.
You can't just rationalize this away.

17:41.600 --> 17:43.465
I know what you think of me right now,
and that's fine.

17:43.560 --> 17:45.721
But I love my kids,
and I'm not gonna fucking lose them.

17:45.810 --> 17:47.300
Oh, come on. Where are you going?

17:47.390 --> 17:50.939
I've got shit to figure out, Wendy.
The Blue Cat alone is not gonna cut it.

18:15.510 --> 18:16.716
Yo.

18:17.720 --> 18:19.290
What's up, ladies?

18:20.970 --> 18:22.460
Fuck happened to you?

18:23.220 --> 18:25.882
- Nothing.
- Chick beat his ass.

18:26.680 --> 18:28.261
Eat a dick, Three.

18:28.350 --> 18:30.841
It was that, uh, Byrde girl.

18:32.230 --> 18:34.357
You just gonna let that little piece
get away with that?

18:34.440 --> 18:35.566
No, Boyd.

18:35.650 --> 18:37.481
You know I don't advocate
hitting a woman.

18:37.570 --> 18:40.812
Somebody needs to toughen him up.
Go on, get up. Hit me. Right here.

18:40.910 --> 18:43.026
- Step off, Boyd.
- Come on, hit me in the face.

18:43.120 --> 18:46.408
Just... What's that, uh, movie? Fuck.
Robert De Niro and the other--

18:46.500 --> 18:47.944
-Step off.
-Raging Bull.

18:48.040 --> 18:50.861
Yeah, Raging Bull. That's it.
Come on, up. Stand up and hit me--

18:50.960 --> 18:53.588
I'm asking you,
step away from my boy!

18:55.170 --> 18:59.174
-Fuck you, man!
-All right, man. Chill out. We're cool.

18:59.930 --> 19:01.079
Chill out.

19:21.240 --> 19:22.605
What is it this time?

19:23.120 --> 19:26.112
-Who fucking knows?
-Is Three fighting, too?

19:26.620 --> 19:28.611
Nah, he's fine.
He's basically passed out.

19:28.700 --> 19:29.780
Hmm.

19:38.710 --> 19:41.008
- What you reading?

19:45.350 --> 19:46.886
You love that guy, huh?

19:47.350 --> 19:49.170
Yeah, except this one's non-fiction.

19:49.680 --> 19:56.108
It's about when he had to write the movie
for Moby-Dick for some hot-shit director.

19:56.190 --> 19:58.226
Got no fucking rest. Almost killed him.

20:02.530 --> 20:03.940
You know what I read?

20:05.320 --> 20:07.572
- My phone.

20:07.660 --> 20:08.866
Texts.

20:09.500 --> 20:11.320
That's fucking it.

20:15.380 --> 20:17.496
-Hey, I was thinking.
-Yeah?

20:18.630 --> 20:24.250
Maybe, uh... after you, like,
invest some of that money or whatever,

20:24.340 --> 20:28.379
I could maybe...
borrow some to go someplace?

20:30.310 --> 20:33.222
Like a vacation?
Florida or some shit like that?

20:34.190 --> 20:35.976
-Sure.
-Yeah.

20:37.150 --> 20:39.527
Or for good, maybe.

20:43.200 --> 20:44.736
Well, where are you gonna go?

20:46.320 --> 20:48.117
I don't know.

20:49.120 --> 20:50.530
Well...

20:51.950 --> 20:53.451
Here's what I'll tell you...

20:54.040 --> 20:57.578
we're gonna get a lot more
than 20 grand soon.

20:58.500 --> 20:59.330
Okay?

21:02.550 --> 21:03.619
You know, Wyatt...

21:04.550 --> 21:08.293
in our world, it's...
it's good to be one of the smart ones.

21:09.510 --> 21:10.716
Remember that.

21:11.970 --> 21:13.096
Okay?

21:16.730 --> 21:18.971
...this season
for the trI-county region.

21:19.060 --> 21:22.644
The visitor bureau estimates high demand
for boats and recreational vehicles.

21:22.730 --> 21:24.778
So make those reservations soon.

21:24.860 --> 21:26.816
And now, a word from our sponsors.

21:26.910 --> 21:28.810
--I'm Sarah McLachlan,

21:28.910 --> 21:32.289
and I'm here to tell you
about an innocent animal who's suffering

21:32.370 --> 21:33.576
and needs your help.

21:34.160 --> 21:37.323
You can help rescue her from abusers,
help her get medicine,

21:37.420 --> 21:40.878
shelter, food and love.

21:40.960 --> 21:43.417
So, please,
instead of changing the channel

21:43.510 --> 21:45.796
or running to the refrigerator
for a snack,

21:45.880 --> 21:47.211
call the number on your screen,

21:47.300 --> 21:50.929
or go online and help us
with a monthly gift, right now.

21:51.010 --> 21:52.420
But not you, Marty.

21:53.470 --> 21:56.177
Not you. I don't trust
you'll care for these animals.

21:56.270 --> 21:59.603
In fact, if you adopt them, they'll die.

21:59.690 --> 22:03.399
So, please, pledge with me now
to save these animals.

22:03.480 --> 22:06.563
Just a small act of kindness
can help save a life.

22:06.650 --> 22:08.277
For just $18 a month, we'll send the...

22:08.360 --> 22:11.409
They are eager to join her on the hunt,

22:11.490 --> 22:13.902
but still far too young.

22:13.990 --> 22:18.745
They would only endanger themselves
and give away her presence.

22:18.830 --> 22:21.128
As prey migrate away

22:21.210 --> 22:23.201
- from the drying plains...

22:23.300 --> 22:27.122
...so, too, must the lioness venture
beyond her familiar territory...

22:27.670 --> 22:28.671
into the territory...

23:06.130 --> 23:07.666
Goddamn it.

23:07.760 --> 23:09.000
What is it?

23:09.090 --> 23:11.081
Fuck. Nothing.

23:12.930 --> 23:13.840
Get some sleep?

23:15.970 --> 23:17.710
Uh, no, but I feel fine.

23:19.770 --> 23:22.011
What is that? Do you hear that?

23:24.400 --> 23:26.140
Jesus. Fuck.

23:35.490 --> 23:36.479
Hey!

23:37.660 --> 23:38.991
Hey!

23:40.000 --> 23:42.412
Hey! Hey!

23:43.000 --> 23:45.241
- Hey!

23:45.340 --> 23:47.331
Oh.

23:48.550 --> 23:51.257
Oh! Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
That's disgusting.

23:52.050 --> 23:54.848
What, you didn't...
you didn't hear vultures in our backyard?

23:54.930 --> 23:56.841
No. No.

23:58.430 --> 24:00.341
-I wanna know how this got here.
-Maybe coyotes?

24:00.430 --> 24:01.931
Mm-mmm. Mm-mmm.

24:02.020 --> 24:05.604
Someone would've had to...
drag it and then leave it.

24:05.690 --> 24:07.851
I'll see if the old man's
got a wheelbarrow.

24:40.310 --> 24:42.016
- Morning.
- Mr. Byrde?

24:42.100 --> 24:43.226
Yeah.

24:43.980 --> 24:45.436
Trevor Evans, FBI.

24:46.270 --> 24:47.225
Oh.

24:47.310 --> 24:48.470
-Have a_seco_nd?
-How's It gomg?

24:48.570 --> 24:50.936
-All right.
-Sure. Absolutely. What can I do for you?

24:51.030 --> 24:54.352
We're looking into the disappearance
of your partner, Bruce Liddell.

24:57.070 --> 24:58.867
The disappearance? What do you mean?

24:58.950 --> 25:00.326
Exactly what I said.

25:00.410 --> 25:04.949
Neither he nor his fiance
have been heard from in almost a week.

25:05.040 --> 25:06.359
Oh, God.

25:07.040 --> 25:08.780
When's the last time you two spoke?

25:10.460 --> 25:13.839
Um... uh...

25:15.010 --> 25:17.797
Tuesday? Last Tuesday, I think.

25:17.890 --> 25:20.506
-What time?
-Uh, I'm not sure.

25:21.430 --> 25:22.806
Disappeared, huh?

25:24.390 --> 25:30.260
Our records indicate he called you
that night at, uh, 11:47 pm.

25:30.860 --> 25:32.316
-Yeah, that sounds right.
-That right?

25:32.400 --> 25:33.435
Yeah, could be.

25:33.530 --> 25:36.488
You spoke for a minute and 12 seconds.

25:37.820 --> 25:38.946
What'd you talk about?

25:40.950 --> 25:42.941
-Well, we didn't.
-You didn't?

25:43.040 --> 25:45.611
No, he left a message. Uh...

25:46.620 --> 25:49.168
He, um, he... Uh, he said a lot.

25:49.250 --> 25:51.707
He was rambling a bit.
You know, maybe drunk.

25:51.800 --> 25:53.495
Uh, I'd called him earlier in the day,

25:53.590 --> 25:57.754
and I... I'd told him that... that I...
I wanted to dissolve the partnership.

25:57.840 --> 26:01.139
-Uh, so maybe that's--
-Why'd you dissolve the partnership?

26:04.020 --> 26:07.729
I, you know, I thought that...
that he was maybe doing something illegal.

26:08.900 --> 26:10.299
I don't know.

26:11.770 --> 26:13.772
And why did you think that?

26:13.860 --> 26:16.181
_ 'Cause he was..._
He just started acting different.

26:16.280 --> 26:18.817
He was nervous about something,
definitely, and...

26:19.780 --> 26:22.738
I caught him making a couple of calls
in Spanish.

26:23.700 --> 26:25.748
-Do you know Spanish?
-I don't.

26:25.830 --> 26:29.618
Uno, dos, tres. That's it.
And I had no idea that he did, yeah.

26:29.710 --> 26:32.417
So I asked him about it,
and... and he was evasive.

26:33.090 --> 26:35.297
That's what set off the, uh...

26:35.380 --> 26:37.257
the... the alarms. You know, and...

26:37.340 --> 26:38.409
Hey, hermit crab.

26:41.590 --> 26:43.922
This is so fucked, isn't it?

26:44.810 --> 26:46.300
Well, Dad's a drug dealer.

26:46.390 --> 26:48.847
If he's a dealer, then I'm a user
'cause I take Advil.

26:49.600 --> 26:50.430
Watch.

26:54.020 --> 26:56.853
--Those are Dad's coworkers.

27:00.490 --> 27:03.277
Just stick with porn. Seriously.

27:06.290 --> 27:09.862
When you think about it,
it's always been, uh, a little bit off.

27:09.960 --> 27:11.200
-You know.
-Here you go, honey.

27:11.290 --> 27:12.666
-Oh. Thanks.
-Hello.

27:12.750 --> 27:13.956
Trevor Evans, FBI.

27:15.300 --> 27:17.120
-FBI? What's going on?
-Yeah.

27:17.210 --> 27:19.462
We believe your husband's partner
was murdered.

27:20.430 --> 27:22.170
-Murdered? Hang on.
-Oh, my God.

27:22.260 --> 27:24.637
You said "disappeared."
What makes you think he was murdered?

27:24.720 --> 27:26.460
How'd Bruce take it
when you dissolved the partnership?

27:27.390 --> 27:29.597
Uh, he didn't take it well,
like I told you.

27:30.100 --> 27:35.060
So... that's why you emptied
your bank accounts and left Chicago?

27:37.650 --> 27:41.313
No, sir. I have a business opportunity
here. What are you implying?

27:43.910 --> 27:48.074
I think the two of you should know
that Bruce was working with us...

27:49.160 --> 27:51.151
as an informant against them.

27:52.290 --> 27:53.166
What?

27:54.040 --> 27:55.280
Who's "them"?

27:56.090 --> 27:57.660
Come on, Wendy. You know.

27:58.800 --> 27:59.835
Know what?

27:59.920 --> 28:03.048
Let's all stop playing this game,
shall we?

28:03.130 --> 28:05.507
It's gotta be exhausting, right?

28:06.430 --> 28:08.637
The lying, the running.

28:09.560 --> 28:11.380
Aren't you both tired?

28:13.350 --> 28:14.977
These people are murderers.

28:16.560 --> 28:18.221
They skin people alive...

28:18.980 --> 28:23.098
or they... they hang them from bridges
to make a point,

28:23.200 --> 28:25.816
or if... if they want someone to just...

28:26.780 --> 28:30.489
disappear...
they dissolve their bodies in acid.

28:31.870 --> 28:33.861
We all know the cartel killed Bruce.

28:34.830 --> 28:37.412
Who's next? You?

28:39.300 --> 28:40.585
Your kids?

28:43.720 --> 28:46.211
You need to tell us what we want to know.

28:50.680 --> 28:54.889
I don't know anything
about Bruce's involvement with any cartel.

28:56.650 --> 28:58.720
We can get you in witness protection.

28:59.980 --> 29:01.140
Keep you safe.

29:04.910 --> 29:07.652
We had an opportunity,

29:07.740 --> 29:12.439
and... and we made a choice to move
our family to... to a more peaceful place.

29:21.590 --> 29:24.127
Did you have any idea
he was working for them?

29:28.890 --> 29:30.130
What do you think?

29:36.520 --> 29:37.976
I'm so sorry.

29:39.730 --> 29:42.312
I gotta get the rest of this shit
off the yard.

29:42.400 --> 29:43.469
You okay?

29:44.950 --> 29:46.815
I'm getting used to betrayal.

30:04.760 --> 30:07.376
-What are you doing here?
-Working.

30:08.680 --> 30:10.841
-What's it look like?
-I didn't hire you.

30:11.300 --> 30:12.881
Take it up with Marty.

30:16.020 --> 30:17.885
Would you look at that?

30:18.980 --> 30:21.972
Shit's so clean you can eat right off it.

30:25.440 --> 30:27.146
I don't hire criminals.

30:27.240 --> 30:29.731
Well, all I've seen is a hard worker.

30:30.700 --> 30:36.320
2009, a series of off-season break-ins
in Osage Beach. Langmores.

30:36.410 --> 30:41.074
2012, a chop shop in Camdenton
doing 15 cars a week. Langmores.

30:41.170 --> 30:43.582
-Should I... Should I continue?
-No, I'm sensing a trend.

30:43.670 --> 30:46.298
Okay, good. 'Cause I haven't even gotten
to the aggravated assaults yet.

30:46.380 --> 30:48.587
Uh, look, she doesn't work
for the Blue Cat. She works for me.

30:48.670 --> 30:50.752
Well, maybe you wanna
talk to me next time.

30:52.300 --> 30:55.098
People deserve a second chance,
just like businesses.

30:55.180 --> 30:59.139
If she steals so much as a fork,
she is gone.

31:16.660 --> 31:18.787
That there what you meant
about another revenue stream?

31:18.870 --> 31:20.997
Pumping gas on a dock?

31:21.920 --> 31:24.832
Can't say as it makes me wish
I'd gone to business school.

31:24.920 --> 31:25.909
How can I help you?

31:27.550 --> 31:29.290
Don't tell me you don't recognize me.

31:29.380 --> 31:31.177
You were all up in my titty bar,

31:31.260 --> 31:34.297
all full of ideas
on how I should go about my business.

31:35.010 --> 31:38.468
What was it that you called yourself,
again? A silent partner?

31:39.060 --> 31:42.939
Secret Santa?
It was... some kind of investor.

31:43.020 --> 31:46.012
-Angel investor.
-Angel, that's right.

31:46.110 --> 31:48.021
You're funny.

31:49.150 --> 31:50.105
Fill her up, son.

31:54.450 --> 31:59.319
I... I was told, over the phone,
that you had organic pistachio ice cream.

31:59.410 --> 32:00.399
Okay.

32:00.500 --> 32:03.207
Yeah. So now that I'm here,
all-all I see is mint.

32:04.170 --> 32:05.831
Please tell me you have some in the back.

32:06.500 --> 32:09.458
-Um, no, ma'am. We don't.
-What do... What do you mean, no?

32:09.550 --> 32:10.756
No?

32:11.300 --> 32:12.119
Um...

32:13.130 --> 32:15.348
-I'm sorry, you made a mistake.
-I drove an hour and a half

32:15.430 --> 32:17.591
to come to this particular supermarket

32:17.680 --> 32:20.922
because one of your employees told me
that you had pistachio ice cream!

32:21.020 --> 32:23.341
-Yes, ma'am, I understand--
-No, I don't think you do!

32:23.440 --> 32:25.806
I mean, is...
is mint the same as pistachio?

32:25.900 --> 32:28.107
-No, ma'am.
-Huh? Is it? Is it?

32:28.190 --> 32:30.238
I mean, it tastes nothing like pistachio.

32:30.320 --> 32:33.778
One has... has chips,
and the other has nuts.

32:33.860 --> 32:36.772
Can you not tell the difference?
Because I sure as hell can!

32:38.530 --> 32:41.693
She was calm. Like her hubby.

32:43.370 --> 32:45.122
They were unified in their story.

32:46.710 --> 32:48.871
I...

32:48.960 --> 32:51.667
Still not certain it was the right tactic.

32:51.760 --> 32:56.788
Well, by announcing yourself in the front,
they won't be watching the back.

33:02.390 --> 33:04.267
And that's presumptuous.

33:06.020 --> 33:07.476
I was going to stay.

33:07.560 --> 33:09.892
Well, and that is presumptuous.

33:17.410 --> 33:19.901
-Breakfast tomorrow?
-Too busy.

33:25.710 --> 33:29.168
You're a sociopath. You know that, right?

33:29.250 --> 33:31.627
Because I don't wanna
be seen in town with a fed?

33:32.800 --> 33:36.793
I don't wanna blow my cover on day one
because my ex-boyfriend,

33:36.880 --> 33:40.884
the only black man in a suit,
with a badge, for 50 miles, is, what?

33:40.970 --> 33:43.768
He's too insecure
to eat breakfast by himself?

33:48.230 --> 33:50.812
Take care... agent.

34:15.510 --> 34:16.499
Wendy!

34:16.590 --> 34:18.626
Unless you have something nice to say,
I don't wanna hear it.

34:19.220 --> 34:20.505
I've had a shit day.

34:22.010 --> 34:23.216
What was shitty about it?

34:23.850 --> 34:25.135
Ice cream, Marty.

34:26.640 --> 34:30.804
I accosted a kid at a store
over fucking pistachio ice cream.

34:31.770 --> 34:34.853
-Okay.
-No, it's not okay. It's not okay at all.

34:35.860 --> 34:38.988
And I... I'm not gonna be a victim
over everything that happens.

34:40.200 --> 34:42.486
Especially since I'm responsible
for most of it.

34:47.460 --> 34:49.325
Sorry, what'd you say?

34:59.680 --> 35:01.921
What the hell are they doing
so near our house?

35:03.760 --> 35:07.594
That's probably because Charlotte
punched the older kid in the face.

35:07.680 --> 35:09.341
-What? When?
-Yeah.

35:09.440 --> 35:11.431
Yesterday, I think.

35:12.110 --> 35:14.852
You know,
this partnership in parenting thing,

35:14.940 --> 35:16.976
it doesn't work unless you tell me
what's happening.

35:17.530 --> 35:19.395
Okay. Just did.

35:26.040 --> 35:27.905
They're trying to intimidate us.

35:28.870 --> 35:32.169
Dead animals pop up.
Now they're stalking us.

35:33.580 --> 35:38.415
Yeah, it's probably 'cause Charlotte,
she punched the older kid in the face,

35:38.510 --> 35:40.831
um... I think yesterday.

35:42.260 --> 35:44.251
-Yeah.
-Get some sleep, Marty.

35:44.350 --> 35:45.669
-Okay.
-Yeah.

35:46.640 --> 35:48.551
Nothing good's ever come
from deprivation, right?

35:48.640 --> 35:50.050
Yeah, you're right.

35:55.320 --> 35:56.469
Hello?

35:57.440 --> 35:58.816
Hello, Sam?

36:07.910 --> 36:08.899
Sam?

36:08.990 --> 36:11.993
Hey! Welcome. Thank you for... coming.

36:12.870 --> 36:14.167
Oh.

36:14.250 --> 36:15.205
That's a greeting.

36:15.290 --> 36:18.623
No, no. It's not that. It's just...
You know what, just... Never mind.

36:18.710 --> 36:22.259
Is there a problem with the house?
Is it Buddy? Is he just--

36:22.340 --> 36:28.051
I was wondering if you might want or...
or need some help?

36:28.760 --> 36:32.059
Help? Like, selling houses?

36:32.140 --> 36:34.517
No, no, no, no. Of course not.
But maybe in the office.

36:34.600 --> 36:37.899
Or, you know, I...
I could help decorate the homes.

36:37.980 --> 36:39.015
Yeah, I'm good at that.

36:39.110 --> 36:41.738
Uh, so... so let me level with you.

36:41.820 --> 36:43.890
You've seen my inventory.

36:43.990 --> 36:47.949
My niche is sort of
rundown spots off the water.

36:49.490 --> 36:52.869
And I was lucky to list Buddy's house.

36:53.660 --> 36:58.165
Plus, my mom stages the houses for me,

36:58.250 --> 37:01.879
and she's... pretty territorial.

37:02.920 --> 37:04.000
So...

37:30.530 --> 37:32.578
And here's the two-two pitch.

37:32.660 --> 37:36.369
Got him with a short.
Hernndez up with it and throws him out.

37:36.460 --> 37:39.952
Another one-two-three inning
for the young...

37:41.500 --> 37:43.548
--Hi. I'm Sarah McLachlan,

37:43.630 --> 37:46.963
and I'm here to tell you
about an innocent animal who's suffering

37:47.050 --> 37:48.426
and needs your help.

37:49.090 --> 37:52.002
You can help rescue her,
help her get medicine, shelter...

37:57.270 --> 38:01.149
Let's get some fresh air
and figure out how to wash more money.

38:02.360 --> 38:04.601
Something fucking stronger, all right?

38:04.690 --> 38:07.853
Smoke and mirrors?
Come on, dickhead. Come on.

38:33.810 --> 38:36.552
Do I steal? Huh? What's the play, Bruce?

38:36.640 --> 38:39.347
What are the rules to this game?
I don't know it.

38:42.770 --> 38:44.180
A whole new game.

38:45.150 --> 38:47.186
Right, Bruce? What do I gotta do, pal?

38:47.280 --> 38:50.613
What's the play, buddy?
I tag up? Do I steal?

38:50.700 --> 38:52.486
I need to play
a little something different.

38:56.450 --> 38:58.827
Turn off the song, Tuck!

39:00.000 --> 39:02.332
Just think it through, buddy. Fuck!

39:13.050 --> 39:15.553
-- You always won

39:15.640 --> 39:18.131
Every time you placed a bet

39:21.520 --> 39:22.976
You're still damn good...

39:53.800 --> 39:57.384
"Do not despise
these small beginnings," he said.

39:58.770 --> 40:03.093
"For the Lord rejoices
to see the work begin.

40:05.610 --> 40:09.182
To see the plumb line
in Zerubbabel's hand."

40:12.910 --> 40:14.559
God was telling Zechariah...

40:15.530 --> 40:19.034
- to not worry what folks may think.

40:20.330 --> 40:25.324
That in any situation, He would be there
to help build it back up. He said...

40:26.290 --> 40:30.545
He said, "Small beginnings
can bring down mountains.

40:32.550 --> 40:34.962
- And what are you, mighty mountain?"

40:35.050 --> 40:37.883
"Before Zerubbabel,
you will become level ground.

40:37.970 --> 40:41.724
And then...
then he will bring out the capstone

40:41.810 --> 40:44.267
to the shouts of 'God bless it."'

40:45.900 --> 40:49.358
Now, if you'd all open up your hymnals
to page 139...

40:49.940 --> 40:52.852
let us join together in song.

41:11.050 --> 41:13.291
Thanks for checking on me
the other night.

41:14.220 --> 41:15.426
What's that?

41:15.510 --> 41:18.138
When I was aspirating a lung.

41:18.220 --> 41:22.259
Wasn't that you creaking around upstairs?
Not checking on me?

41:25.060 --> 41:26.220
Sorry.

41:30.320 --> 41:32.220
Boy, uh, you know, Buddy...

41:33.740 --> 41:35.901
any chance you could start
throwing on some trunks?

41:35.990 --> 41:38.447
You got people in the house now. Kids.

41:39.410 --> 41:40.445
No.

41:46.870 --> 41:48.371
Nice chatting with you.

42:05.310 --> 42:07.187
The... the kitchen's right around here.

42:07.270 --> 42:08.589
There's such a great feel to it.

42:08.690 --> 42:11.397
It's the perfect starter home
to raise a family.

42:11.480 --> 42:13.528
-Oh, Sam, hi. Um...
-Hey.

42:13.610 --> 42:15.521
This is Sam,
who's the actual listing agent.

42:15.610 --> 42:17.942
And they just popped in
while I was setting up.

42:18.030 --> 42:20.442
That's great. Hey, um,
can I talk to you for just a second?

42:20.530 --> 42:21.736
Mm-hmm.

42:23.790 --> 42:24.745
I'm sorry.

42:24.830 --> 42:28.243
I just... I thought my furniture would be
more useful here than in storage.

42:28.330 --> 42:30.582
No, it's... it's great.

42:30.670 --> 42:32.206
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

42:32.290 --> 42:35.009
I know how to sell the idea
of a happy family.

42:36.380 --> 42:38.211
Mom's gonna be pissed.

42:39.800 --> 42:42.633
Uh, the kitchen is...
is right around here. Mm-hmm.

43:11.630 --> 43:13.871
-What?
-You're pretty.

43:24.260 --> 43:26.637
You ever listen to old-school hip-hop?

43:26.720 --> 43:29.268
Tupac, Eazy, shit like that?

43:29.810 --> 43:32.802
No, but I will start.

43:40.990 --> 43:43.311
-It's my favorite swimming cove. Okay?
-Okay.

43:43.410 --> 43:45.981
--All right, you guys have fun.

43:52.880 --> 43:54.666
- Oh, hang on, one second.
- Yup.

43:56.130 --> 43:57.620
Looks good, huh?

43:57.710 --> 44:01.009
It'll look even better at night,
obviously, all lit up.

44:01.090 --> 44:03.968
But, um, maybe we don't even need it.
Look at all these people.

44:04.050 --> 44:05.540
We're not even in season yet.

44:06.350 --> 44:08.671
What do you think? You like the sign?

44:09.640 --> 44:10.629
Sure.

44:11.560 --> 44:13.391
"Sure"? That's it?

44:14.400 --> 44:15.515
What am I supposed to say?

44:17.570 --> 44:20.107
Rachel, you did not have to take my money
if you didn't want it.

44:22.240 --> 44:23.355
I know.

44:24.410 --> 44:25.445
Okay.

44:29.160 --> 44:30.570
Don't get my hopes up.

44:42.130 --> 44:44.883
No, honestly, we just...
We needed a change.

44:44.970 --> 44:47.211
And it's... it's a nice resort.

44:47.300 --> 44:50.599
Well, it's a fixer-upper, that's for sure.

44:50.680 --> 44:52.636
Oh, the kids are great.
Yeah, yeah, they're great.

44:52.730 --> 44:56.143
There's a huge, huge lake here.
So, you know, what's not to like?

44:57.190 --> 44:58.976
I know. I... I know.

45:01.780 --> 45:04.146
Linda, I have to call you back.
Let me call you back.

45:06.820 --> 45:10.278
- Hey! Hey, hey, hey! Shh-- Shoo!

45:52.040 --> 45:53.155
Fuck!

45:59.130 --> 46:03.794
Either of you, you fuck with my daughter,
you come near my house again,

46:03.880 --> 46:06.041
it'll be you the vultures are picking at.

46:37.080 --> 46:38.365
It's melted.

46:41.630 --> 46:44.417
Well, it'll be in the freezer
when you want it.

46:48.760 --> 46:50.330
Mom, uh...

47:47.480 --> 47:49.948
"It's the only loss you could forsake,

47:50.030 --> 47:55.479
it's the... only bluff you couldn't fake.
You're still the same."

47:55.580 --> 47:58.743
-What is that? Is that Bob Seger?
-It is.

48:00.160 --> 48:01.912
Do you even like Bob Seger?

48:02.000 --> 48:04.491
Uh-uh. No, not anymore.

48:05.500 --> 48:08.663
It's not enough. It's not enough.

48:08.760 --> 48:10.045
What's not?

48:10.590 --> 48:13.172
I gotta be something else.

48:14.930 --> 48:17.091
-Like what?
-I gotta man up.

48:17.180 --> 48:19.466
I gotta... I gotta be something else.

48:19.560 --> 48:20.766
It's...

48:22.310 --> 48:24.892
It's not enough. Not in three months.
I gotta...

48:25.900 --> 48:29.939
I gotta take the fight to them.
I gotta get dirty. I gotta...

49:17.320 --> 49:19.902
-So, what do you want to do?
-Yeah, can you just dance?

49:20.870 --> 49:23.202
Can you just...
Can you just face me and dance,

49:23.290 --> 49:26.578
and just look me right in the eye,
and don't stop. Okay?

49:26.670 --> 49:27.659
Okay.

49:34.470 --> 49:36.426
I want you to tell me about your boss.

49:43.100 --> 49:45.807
I'm a fucking sociopath?

49:45.890 --> 49:47.972
Me?

49:49.900 --> 49:52.687
I'm not the drone operator
eating Hot Pockets

49:52.780 --> 49:56.193
while he bombs a hospital in Kabul.

50:01.870 --> 50:06.614
A satellite killer
with plausible deniability, hmm?

50:13.510 --> 50:18.789
All the while, the number of overdoses
in this country just blows up...

50:18.890 --> 50:21.211
like a fucking piata.

50:25.520 --> 50:27.727
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

50:28.650 --> 50:29.639
Yeah.

50:41.530 --> 50:43.020
You okay, man?

50:44.660 --> 50:45.786
Yeah.

50:47.870 --> 50:49.531
Your money's on the table.

50:57.300 --> 50:59.291
You got issues, dude.

50:59.380 --> 51:01.177
So I've been told.

51:24.870 --> 51:25.939
Motherfuckers.

51:44.850 --> 51:47.808
-What are you doing up?
-I couldn't sleep either.

52:01.240 --> 52:02.480
Are you okay?

52:07.580 --> 52:11.243
I don't expect you
to forgive me...

52:12.210 --> 52:16.294
but I am trying to make everything right.
Okay?

52:17.880 --> 52:18.835
I know.

52:21.260 --> 52:22.249
You sure?

52:23.590 --> 52:24.966
Yeah.

52:32.020 --> 52:34.682
-Who loves you?
-You do, Dad.

52:44.820 --> 52:46.310
Where you going?

52:50.450 --> 52:51.496
Mmm.

53:31.250 --> 53:33.707
- What the fuck is that?

53:35.670 --> 53:37.661
-What?
-That.

53:38.630 --> 53:40.666
The fucking kitty cats in the cage.

53:40.750 --> 53:43.583
I told you not to touch
that fucking money.

53:43.670 --> 53:48.004
They're not kitty cats.
They're bobcats. Tell her, Russ.

53:48.090 --> 53:50.968
You'd be surprised,
the market for exotic pets.

53:52.220 --> 53:55.348
Look online. They're all over this area.

53:57.480 --> 54:00.472
Make a hundred times
what we've spent with the cats.

54:04.360 --> 54:06.100
Get the fuck over there.

54:34.430 --> 54:37.479
You see a pair of balls on either of them?

54:48.360 --> 54:52.649
Goddamn it, Boyd. I told you three times
to check the undercarriages.

54:54.620 --> 54:57.578
What are they gonna fucking do,
scissor each other?

54:57.660 --> 54:59.537
Why you getting on us?
We know you been working

54:59.620 --> 55:00.621
-for that Byrde dude.
-So?

55:00.710 --> 55:01.745
Quit while you're behind!

55:01.840 --> 55:04.240
How you gonna get his money
working for minimum wage?

55:05.250 --> 55:06.330
Fuckin' A.

55:07.970 --> 55:08.959
What?

55:09.630 --> 55:10.836
Get in there.

55:11.800 --> 55:13.927
- Fuck that.

55:14.010 --> 55:18.128
I mean it! Now,
you disobedient motherfuckers! Get in!

55:19.060 --> 55:20.721
Calm the fuck down, Ruth.

55:26.740 --> 55:28.446
The fuck you doing?

55:30.740 --> 55:32.981
-Very funny.
-Shut the fuck up!

55:35.280 --> 55:38.579
Listen good. I do have a plan.

55:40.120 --> 55:44.875
I'm working with Martin
so I can learn how to launder for us.

55:45.840 --> 55:49.719
When I do,
I'm gonna take the money...

55:52.510 --> 55:54.000
and kill him.

55:57.930 --> 56:00.091
You got anything to say about that?

56:05.690 --> 56:07.317
That's a sound plan.

56:10.650 --> 56:12.311
Get some sleep.

56:15.080 --> 56:17.537
_ Wait a minute. You_...
You just gonna leave us in here?

56:17.620 --> 56:20.157
--Looks like that.

56:22.790 --> 56:24.667
-Fucking idiot. No, fuck you!
-Fuck you.

56:24.750 --> 56:26.206

56:26.290 --> 56:28.121

56:30.420 --> 56:32.547
Give me lip

56:32.630 --> 56:34.211
Get a stick

56:34.300 --> 56:36.291
I can end a conversation real quick

56:36.390 --> 56:37.880

56:42.480 --> 56:45.222
Pinch your momma on the booty
Kick your dog, fuck your bitch

56:45.310 --> 56:48.438
Fat boy dressed up like he's Santa
And took pictures with your kids

56:48.530 --> 56:51.237

We will cut a frowny face in your chest

56:51.320 --> 56:53.231

56:53.320 --> 56:55.231
I'm a mensch, get correct

56:55.320 --> 56:57.231
I will walk into a court while erect

56:57.330 --> 57:00.538
Screaming, "Yes!
I am guilty motherfuckers, I am death"

57:01.330 --> 57:03.241
Hey, you wanna hear a good joke?
