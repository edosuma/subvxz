WEBVTT

00:03.397 --> 00:07.066
Hey, Ralph, I need $30,000.

00:07.068 --> 00:09.270
Whoa, that is a hot entrance.

00:09.295 --> 00:11.310
Ralph, I need my drops please.

00:11.335 --> 00:13.346
My eyes are hungy.

00:13.706 --> 00:15.330
All right, Helen. Here we go.

00:15.355 --> 00:17.143
Oh, gimme!

00:17.168 --> 00:18.467
There you go.

00:18.625 --> 00:20.525
Oh, yummy, yummy.

00:20.527 --> 00:21.859
Okay, what's wrong, Jack?

00:21.861 --> 00:24.762
Yeah, well, so last
night I was driving home

00:24.764 --> 00:27.984
and some creature like
a deer or maybe a bum,

00:28.009 --> 00:30.257
something, who knows,
leapt 10 feet into the fog

00:30.282 --> 00:31.515
right in front of my car.

00:31.540 --> 00:33.690
So I swerved, you know,
saving the bum's life...

00:33.715 --> 00:34.936
No, this sounds like a deer.

00:34.961 --> 00:36.640
Bums can only jump like 4 or 5 feet.

00:36.665 --> 00:39.308
Well, either way, you know,
I swerved, and I hit a tree,

00:39.333 --> 00:40.722
and I totaled my car, all right?

00:40.747 --> 00:42.447
So this morning I called an Uber

00:42.472 --> 00:44.505
and got gouged because of some scam

00:44.530 --> 00:46.130
called "Surge Pricing" or something.

00:46.155 --> 00:47.202
Anyway, to get my money's worth

00:47.226 --> 00:48.892
I grabbed all the stupid amenities.

00:48.917 --> 00:52.718
Point being, I'm gonna need a
$30,000 advance for a new car.

00:52.743 --> 00:54.377
I enjoy a Jeep Rubicon.

00:54.402 --> 00:56.168
Ooh, love that. Might go Rubicon.

00:56.181 --> 00:58.248
Okay, we really don't
have the budget for that,

00:58.250 --> 01:01.351
but we've been missing
a Driver's Ed teacher

01:01.353 --> 01:02.548
ever since Linda disappeared.

01:02.573 --> 01:03.579
Oh, Linda.

01:03.604 --> 01:05.972
You'd have 24/7 access to the car.

01:06.258 --> 01:07.666
Okay, well, what... what kind of wheels

01:07.690 --> 01:08.989
are we talking about here?

01:08.991 --> 01:13.903
We are talking about V4, automatic,

01:13.930 --> 01:15.730
big sign on the roof.

01:15.732 --> 01:16.831
Is she fast?

01:16.833 --> 01:18.633
No.

01:18.635 --> 01:20.435
- I accept.
- Yeah.

01:20.437 --> 01:23.004
- All right. You want a mint?
- Yes.

01:25.000 --> 01:31.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:39.856 --> 01:41.323
Everybody, shut up.

01:41.325 --> 01:43.224
Attention, attention, everybody.

01:43.226 --> 01:46.761
All right, Grace, your
attention please. Jeez.

01:46.763 --> 01:49.496
Well, I'll assume that you all
heard that I've humbled myself

01:49.498 --> 01:52.100
by accepting the position
of Driver's Ed instructor,

01:52.102 --> 01:53.935
and apparently, that position requires

01:53.937 --> 01:55.369
a valid driver's license.

01:55.371 --> 01:57.304
So last night, I was
searching my apartment

01:57.306 --> 01:59.607
and I found this.

01:59.609 --> 02:02.009
This is a letter from Saint
Benedict's Catholic Church

02:02.011 --> 02:04.812
thanking my dead mother's estate

02:04.814 --> 02:08.582
for her bequest of $12,000

02:08.584 --> 02:12.620
which they used to buy a
statue of the Virgin Mary.

02:14.990 --> 02:17.524
So dome money-grubbing priest

02:17.526 --> 02:19.826
barged in on my dead Mom's deathbed

02:19.828 --> 02:22.563
and conned her out of
her life savings. Nice.

02:22.565 --> 02:25.799
And you were there for this
unlikely sequence of events?

02:25.801 --> 02:27.601
Well, no, Dan, I wasn't there-there.

02:27.603 --> 02:29.002
I was stuck in Cambridge,
but you know how

02:29.004 --> 02:31.004
these clergy work. Mr. Griffin,

02:31.006 --> 02:33.240
do you maybe have something
against the church?

02:33.242 --> 02:36.877
Try 13 years of Sunday School.

02:36.879 --> 02:40.547
Every week hearing what a
bad little boy you've become.

02:40.549 --> 02:42.483
The sisters of perpetual torment

02:42.485 --> 02:44.652
making you feel like Pol Pot

02:44.654 --> 02:46.553
because you stuck gum
under a pew one time.

02:46.555 --> 02:48.989
Well, I'm not bad. They're bad!

02:50.993 --> 02:53.226
Anyway, the fact of the
matter is that's my statue

02:53.228 --> 02:54.961
and with your help

02:54.963 --> 02:56.263
I'm gonna steal it from them.

02:56.265 --> 02:58.865
That's pretty metal.

03:00.735 --> 03:03.710
Mr. Griffin, stealing from
a church feels pretty low

03:03.721 --> 03:04.971
even for you.

03:04.973 --> 03:06.239
I go to Saint Benedict's

03:06.241 --> 03:07.841
every Sunday with my grandmother.

03:07.843 --> 03:10.443
I'm in the choir. They
let me sing Rihanna.

03:10.445 --> 03:12.578
I want no part of this.

03:12.580 --> 03:14.915
Is that how everybody feels?

03:14.917 --> 03:17.717
Yeah? Grace?

03:17.719 --> 03:20.920
Wow. Okay, fine. Yeah.

03:20.922 --> 03:23.755
Mission aborted.

03:23.757 --> 03:26.792
Have it your way, guys.
Really appreciate it.

03:26.794 --> 03:28.861
All right, let's see. Ah!

03:28.863 --> 03:31.363
Anthony, Victor, and Heather,

03:31.365 --> 03:33.498
I'll see you at 2:00 for Driver's Ed,

03:33.500 --> 03:34.967
but don't expect to have a good time

03:34.969 --> 03:37.036
because I am in a mood.

03:38.639 --> 03:41.273
At night do you keep, like,
a baseball bat beside your bed

03:41.275 --> 03:42.774
in case a home invader comes in?

03:42.776 --> 03:44.543
I have a straight up machete.

03:44.545 --> 03:46.045
I have a fork,

03:46.047 --> 03:48.214
and if I'm being honest,
under it is a plate

03:48.216 --> 03:50.549
and around it is spaghetti.

03:50.551 --> 03:52.184
Wow, this is a real quizzer.

03:52.186 --> 03:53.952
My friend sent me a bunch of emojis

03:53.954 --> 03:55.920
and I have no idea what this means.

03:55.922 --> 04:00.024
Ooh, is it something
juicy, something filthy?

04:00.026 --> 04:03.061
First there's a doctor, then
there's a lady in a dress,

04:03.063 --> 04:06.464
then a martini, martini, and a martini,

04:06.466 --> 04:10.168
a hotel, a pill, a sleepy face,

04:10.170 --> 04:13.404
a needle, a "What?
Who, me?" kind of shrug,

04:13.406 --> 04:14.973
and then money, money, money,

04:14.975 --> 04:17.909
lady in a bathing suit,
and a palm tree island.

04:17.911 --> 04:20.511
Helen, I think your friend's about

04:20.512 --> 04:22.446
to murder a doctor for money.

04:22.448 --> 04:25.216
But she's married to a doctor...

04:25.218 --> 04:27.818
Oh, my Gondo.

04:30.923 --> 04:34.557
Doing great, Vic. Little slow.

04:34.559 --> 04:36.760
You also seem terrified.

04:36.762 --> 04:39.963
Okay, Victor, bust a U-Turn here.

04:39.965 --> 04:41.531
When do I signal?

04:41.533 --> 04:43.433
Now? Is it already too late?

04:43.435 --> 04:45.535
Signaling is, it's pretty optional.

04:45.537 --> 04:47.137
Oh.

04:47.139 --> 04:49.773
Yeah, you're gonna want to
make your way back to the road.

04:49.775 --> 04:51.975
Oh, God. Oh, God.

04:51.977 --> 04:54.250
Okay, let's just, we're
gonna find our way back.

04:55.426 --> 04:57.094
Kay, yeah, now go ahead
and hit the brakes.

04:57.118 --> 04:58.985
There you go.

05:00.109 --> 05:02.676
Um, why are we at my church?

05:04.164 --> 05:08.032
It's on, baby.

05:08.034 --> 05:10.201
Ugh. Wow.

05:10.203 --> 05:12.637
Okay, I botched that.
Let's forget the hat thing.

05:12.639 --> 05:15.006
All right, come on. Everybody out.

05:15.008 --> 05:16.307
Let's go.

05:17.516 --> 05:20.577
Are you crazy? My grandma
and I come here every week.

05:20.602 --> 05:22.469
I am not helping you steal a statue.

05:22.471 --> 05:24.311
Well, we can't steal something

05:24.336 --> 05:26.804
that's already rightfully
mine, so problem solved.

05:26.806 --> 05:28.072
You don't see Victor complaining.

05:28.074 --> 05:30.667
- I'm just happy to be out of the car.
- Right.

05:30.676 --> 05:33.377
I almost had a nervous movement.

05:33.379 --> 05:35.679
- A poo.
- Yeah, I know...

05:35.681 --> 05:38.016
Good to know, thanks for sharing.

05:38.063 --> 05:40.330
All right, look, Anthony,
you're already an accessory.

05:40.332 --> 05:42.332
Okay, you're in too deep, buddy.

05:42.334 --> 05:44.166
Plus you're the strongest one here.

05:44.168 --> 05:46.235
I need your help carrying this thing.

05:46.237 --> 05:50.539
Fine, but only because you
appeal to my sense of vanity.

05:50.541 --> 05:53.109
- Got A-Train.
- Got A-Train, all right.

05:55.446 --> 05:57.513
- Maybe a little quicker?
- You get what you get!

05:57.515 --> 05:59.849
Get what I get, all right.

05:59.851 --> 06:02.051
Come on.

06:11.763 --> 06:15.031
Okay, come on. Let's go.

06:21.337 --> 06:24.072
Okay, here. Come on.

06:24.074 --> 06:26.240
We gotta spread this.

06:26.242 --> 06:27.608
Spread this.

06:27.610 --> 06:29.510
Okay.

06:29.512 --> 06:32.480
Tip it. Tip it.

06:32.482 --> 06:33.982
Go, go, go.

06:37.320 --> 06:38.987
Anthony, ready? Go on three.

06:38.989 --> 06:42.090
On three. One, two...

07:00.009 --> 07:03.411
Come on. Okay. All right.

07:03.413 --> 07:04.912
What are you doing?
Why are you driving?!

07:04.914 --> 07:06.914
I don't know!

07:06.916 --> 07:08.649
All right.

07:08.651 --> 07:11.319
Go, go, go.

07:15.391 --> 07:17.592
Come on, man, one pedal at a time.

07:17.594 --> 07:20.139
What is happening?

07:20.164 --> 07:21.537
Go!

07:21.569 --> 07:23.135
Come on, Vic. You got it, buddy.

07:23.137 --> 07:25.137
Let's go.

07:42.022 --> 07:44.802
Jack, Jack, yeah, I
don't want to alarm you.

07:44.827 --> 07:46.660
This is bad. Real nightmare stuff.

07:46.662 --> 07:48.528
I just got off the phone
with Saint Benedict's Church.

07:48.530 --> 07:51.531
Someone stole a statue from
there yesterday afternoon.

07:51.533 --> 07:55.635
One of the priests saw
the Whitlock High Dri...

07:56.771 --> 07:58.538
The Whitlock High Driver's Ed car

07:58.540 --> 08:00.706
speeding away from
the scene of the crime.

08:00.708 --> 08:02.708
Did they see who did
it or how many kids?

08:02.710 --> 08:04.710
No, just the car. Did you see anything?

08:04.712 --> 08:07.263
Did I see... No, I just had a lesson,

08:07.365 --> 08:08.423
and then I came back to school,

08:08.447 --> 08:10.347
put my keys right in
the middle of my desk

08:10.521 --> 08:14.623
and went to work on my
book in the library alone.

08:14.625 --> 08:15.825
One of your students

08:15.827 --> 08:17.160
must have taken the keys off the desk,

08:17.162 --> 08:18.594
- borrowed the car...
- Yep.

08:18.596 --> 08:20.262
Stolen the statue.

08:20.264 --> 08:22.165
Now I'm gonna cross-reference
which one of your students

08:22.167 --> 08:24.901
is a middle child because
they look for attention.

08:24.903 --> 08:27.469
It seems like you might
have a juggalo in your class.

08:27.471 --> 08:31.973
Yep. Yes, this all feels like
a very credible hypothesis.

08:31.975 --> 08:35.243
Let's find this middle child juggalo.

08:35.245 --> 08:37.078
The church wants to handle this quietly,

08:37.081 --> 08:40.048
but they're sending
someone to the school

08:40.049 --> 08:41.783
and they're gonna have
to talk to your students.

08:41.784 --> 08:43.384
We need to find this punk,

08:43.385 --> 08:46.554
but it's gonna be tough
because without the makeup

08:46.556 --> 08:48.123
juggalos looks like everyone else.

08:48.125 --> 08:51.626
It could be someone
you work with every day.

08:56.100 --> 08:59.768
Well, bad news, kiddos. We pooched it.

08:59.770 --> 09:02.303
Yep. The church knows someone
used the Driver's Ed car

09:02.305 --> 09:03.605
to steal the statue.

09:03.607 --> 09:05.273
Anyway, it's no big deal.

09:05.275 --> 09:07.375
They think that any of you
could have taken my keys,

09:07.377 --> 09:10.278
so the church is sending some
fuddy-duddy priest down here

09:10.280 --> 09:13.080
to play Columbo and ask
you all some questions.

09:13.082 --> 09:15.717
Look, most of you just need
to tell the truth, you know?

09:15.719 --> 09:17.051
After school, you were engaged

09:17.053 --> 09:19.387
in various extracurricular activities.

09:19.389 --> 09:20.503
Lacrosse, glee club,

09:20.528 --> 09:22.335
anything that lets me
hold on to my mom's statue.

09:22.359 --> 09:24.259
I don't care. All right,
Heather, Victor, Anthony,

09:24.261 --> 09:26.160
you guys just need to
come up with an easy alibi.

09:26.162 --> 09:28.195
Something simple.
Something you can stick to.

09:28.197 --> 09:30.765
And it can be anything.

09:30.767 --> 09:33.334
Okay, now this attitude
immediately worries me.

09:33.336 --> 09:34.535
Got it.

09:34.537 --> 09:37.338
I was on a date with...

09:37.340 --> 09:39.373
A supermodel.

09:39.375 --> 09:40.641
Pew!

09:40.643 --> 09:43.376
No. No, no, no. Absolutely not.

09:43.401 --> 09:44.517
Come up with something better than that.

09:44.526 --> 09:46.245
Heather, I know you'll come
up with something great.

09:46.269 --> 09:47.468
Anthony, you good?

09:47.493 --> 09:48.825
The only reason I'm doing this

09:48.850 --> 09:50.543
is so my grandma doesn't find out

09:50.568 --> 09:52.134
and for the record, I'm not thrilled

09:52.159 --> 09:54.460
about lying to a priest.

09:54.485 --> 09:56.084
Awesome, so we're good.

09:56.109 --> 09:57.942
Yeah, everybody just
needs to stay strong and,

09:57.953 --> 09:59.352
you know, everything'll be...

10:03.859 --> 10:06.932
What is it, boss?

10:06.957 --> 10:08.290
Boss?

10:19.741 --> 10:21.340
Nuns.

10:21.342 --> 10:24.176
They sent nuns.

10:25.891 --> 10:28.126
Do you guys think they saw me?

10:28.128 --> 10:29.784
Saw you? What are you talking about?

10:30.151 --> 10:31.685
It's a simple question, Sarika.

10:31.687 --> 10:34.612
That pod of nuns. Did they see me?

10:34.628 --> 10:36.894
God, it's hot in here
and getting louder.

10:36.896 --> 10:38.329
Everybody, just... just back off me.

10:38.331 --> 10:40.665
Okay, stop looking at me. Grace!

10:40.667 --> 10:42.233
Okay.

10:42.235 --> 10:44.969
Oh, God! No, Durbin, bad, bad!

10:44.971 --> 10:46.404
Do not sneak up on me like that.

10:46.406 --> 10:47.805
Sorry, Jack.

10:47.807 --> 10:50.608
It's these dress Toms.
They are so quiet.

10:50.610 --> 10:52.577
They're ready to start the interview.

10:52.579 --> 10:54.812
Sarika, you're up first,

10:54.814 --> 10:58.416
and I will look into
getting louder shoes.

10:59.686 --> 11:01.152
All right, Sarika, you got this.

11:01.154 --> 11:02.786
It's gonna be fine.
Just stick to your story,

11:02.788 --> 11:05.689
and don't let them use
their powers on you.

11:05.691 --> 11:09.730
Mr. Griffin, do you believe
the nuns have special powers?

11:09.755 --> 11:10.794
A little.

11:10.796 --> 11:13.330
I do, I think they have
a little bit of magic.

11:13.332 --> 11:14.931
Okay.

11:14.933 --> 11:18.602
Sarika, just don't look them
directly in the eyes, okay?

11:18.604 --> 11:21.605
Sarika, just to be safe!

11:30.949 --> 11:32.683
Sarika Sarkar.

11:32.685 --> 11:35.652
What unfortunate circumstances
bring us together today.

11:35.654 --> 11:37.620
But what a lovely jacket.

11:37.622 --> 11:39.823
Oh, thank you. I got it at the store...

11:39.825 --> 11:42.025
You know, Sarika, the
Bible says that in the end

11:42.027 --> 11:47.063
liars will reside in the
lake that burns with fire.

11:47.065 --> 11:51.500
Where were you between
2:00 and 5:00 yesterday?

11:51.502 --> 11:55.171
- I was...
- Sit up.

11:55.173 --> 11:57.874
I was at study hall.

11:57.876 --> 12:00.409
Really?

12:00.411 --> 12:03.579
- I was watching sports.
- What game?

12:03.581 --> 12:06.149
It was porn.

12:06.151 --> 12:08.351
You guys are good.

12:08.353 --> 12:10.086
I...

12:10.088 --> 12:14.156
okay, this lady has not
blinked since I been in here.

12:14.158 --> 12:15.423
Does she ever blink?

12:15.425 --> 12:17.226
I drink, I cuss, I sleep around.

12:17.228 --> 12:18.693
What are you gonna do about it?

12:18.695 --> 12:21.563
I don't think you do
any of those things.

12:21.565 --> 12:23.365
I use the B-word sometimes.

12:23.367 --> 12:24.933
Who hasn't?

12:25.903 --> 12:28.370
Damn it, where's my damn splenda?!

12:28.372 --> 12:30.405
Michelle.

12:30.407 --> 12:33.041
Oh, my gosh. I'm so sorry.

12:33.043 --> 12:35.710
Well, that's still seven Hail Marys.

12:37.581 --> 12:38.881
There we go.

12:38.883 --> 12:40.749
Okay, cool nun, you got jokes.

12:40.751 --> 12:42.251
Are you allowed to do that?

12:42.253 --> 12:43.752
Yes, we're allowed to joke.

12:43.754 --> 12:45.519
Are you allowed to skateboard?

12:45.521 --> 12:46.620
What's the deal with that whole thing?

12:46.622 --> 12:48.756
I think we can skateboard.

12:48.758 --> 12:50.291
So do you get your own clothes

12:50.293 --> 12:52.393
or just, like, grab one of those

12:52.395 --> 12:54.528
off a big pile every morning?

12:54.530 --> 12:56.297
- Uh...
- Can you cuddle?

12:56.299 --> 12:57.564
That's a gray area.

12:57.566 --> 13:00.734
Have you ever eaten a jalapeño?

13:00.736 --> 13:03.604
- Once.
- Ooh, you're a bad girl.

13:03.606 --> 13:05.606
- In Rome.
- Ooh.

13:05.608 --> 13:07.708
Oh, she got a Roman jalapeño.

13:07.710 --> 13:09.376
I said we should go Yogurtland

13:09.378 --> 13:12.046
because they know me
there. She didn't want to

13:12.048 --> 13:14.615
because of her modeling, but I said that

13:14.617 --> 13:16.150
I thought she looked really good

13:16.152 --> 13:18.719
regardless of how much yogurt she ate

13:18.721 --> 13:21.955
because I'm a very
body positive type of...

13:21.957 --> 13:26.092
It seems our thief left a
glass slipper at the scene.

13:26.094 --> 13:30.630
Does this retainer look familiar?

13:30.632 --> 13:32.833
Oh, that's not mine.

13:32.835 --> 13:35.135
There's only way to find out.

13:35.137 --> 13:37.470
What?

13:37.472 --> 13:39.405
Open.

13:45.613 --> 13:47.780
Hey, hey, how'd it go? Did you cave?

13:47.782 --> 13:49.449
You caved. I knew you'd cave.

13:49.451 --> 13:51.251
- Damn it, Victor!
- I didn't cave.

13:51.253 --> 13:53.585
They think I'm innocent.
Yes, you're my rock, Vic!

13:53.587 --> 13:55.254
Always have been.

13:55.256 --> 13:57.656
I think we've got
bigger problems though.

13:57.658 --> 13:59.658
They found a retainer at the church

13:59.660 --> 14:02.094
and they made me try it on.

14:02.096 --> 14:04.330
What?

14:04.332 --> 14:06.465
Oh, no. My retainer's gone.

14:06.467 --> 14:07.933
It must have fallen out of my pocket.

14:07.935 --> 14:09.801
No, Anthony, once they
make you try it on,

14:09.803 --> 14:11.170
they'll see that it fits,

14:11.172 --> 14:13.005
and then they'll have us dead to rights.

14:13.007 --> 14:15.174
The nuns win.

14:16.610 --> 14:20.179
This is what I get for
being a bad little boy.

14:22.227 --> 14:23.586
I mean, all they're gonna see

14:23.593 --> 14:25.092
is a teacher who stole from a church.

14:25.094 --> 14:27.218
They're not gonna care
that I was a good boy

14:27.243 --> 14:29.009
who was trying to
avenge his dead mother.

14:29.011 --> 14:31.111
I mean, I... I'm screwed.

14:31.113 --> 14:32.380
We all are.

14:36.285 --> 14:38.118
They only have evidence on me.

14:38.120 --> 14:40.054
No one else has to get in trouble.

14:40.056 --> 14:41.955
What?

14:41.957 --> 14:43.791
You'd take the fall?

14:43.793 --> 14:45.625
Sweet, sweet Anthony, would you do that?

14:45.627 --> 14:46.727
I could kiss you.

14:46.729 --> 14:49.096
I'll try and keep that in
mind when my grandmother

14:49.098 --> 14:50.964
wants nothing to do with me.

14:50.966 --> 14:53.633
Yeah.

14:56.471 --> 14:57.805
Anthony, I appreciate the gesture,

14:57.807 --> 15:00.440
but is the sad walk really necessary?

15:00.442 --> 15:02.309
Come on, man. Look,
I know it's my fault,

15:02.311 --> 15:04.078
but I was just trying
to avenge my mother.

15:04.080 --> 15:05.746
Anthony. Come on, man.

15:05.748 --> 15:07.581
Look at me.

15:07.583 --> 15:10.482
Anthony, wait, wait, wait.

15:10.484 --> 15:11.650
All right, look, there's only one way

15:11.652 --> 15:13.569
to get rid of these Dementors.

15:13.571 --> 15:15.454
Patronus.

15:15.456 --> 15:17.489
No, we need to get the
statue back to the church

15:17.491 --> 15:19.491
before they figure out who stole it.

15:19.493 --> 15:21.728
Heather, Victor, Anthony,
I need you to pick it up

15:21.730 --> 15:23.662
and sneak it back into the church.

15:23.664 --> 15:26.999
We'll add Dan Decker for muscle.

15:27.001 --> 15:29.635
Schwing.

15:29.637 --> 15:31.104
What are you going to do?

15:31.106 --> 15:33.940
I'm gonna go stall those nuns.

15:38.346 --> 15:41.747
Hi, how are you... how are you doing?

15:41.749 --> 15:43.281
I'm sorry. Who are you?

15:43.283 --> 15:45.516
Oh, right. Duh.

15:45.518 --> 15:48.019
I'm Jack. I'm the Driver's Ed professor.

15:48.021 --> 15:52.624
Just thought maybe I could
help you guys crack this case.

15:52.626 --> 15:55.093
It is hot as hel... it is hot in here.

15:55.095 --> 15:59.030
Can I... do you mind if I?

15:59.032 --> 16:00.866
Very, very dry.

16:00.948 --> 16:04.216
Have you guys checked the Protestants?

16:04.218 --> 16:05.750
They hate you guys.

16:05.752 --> 16:08.453
- Be quiet.
- Oh.

16:08.455 --> 16:11.356
What did you say your name was again?

16:11.358 --> 16:12.924
Jack.

16:12.926 --> 16:16.626
Jack... Griffin.

16:16.628 --> 16:19.163
Are you Rosemary's son?

16:20.599 --> 16:24.468
Yep. That's right.

16:27.539 --> 16:29.473
Ooh, there's one.

16:29.475 --> 16:32.421
Victor, there's... and
there's another one.

16:32.446 --> 16:33.797
Just park.

16:33.828 --> 16:37.178
That's a sideways one. I
can only do ones like this.

16:37.202 --> 16:38.735
Can we just hurry up already?

16:38.737 --> 16:40.603
Yo, Vic, can I please just park, Vic?

16:40.605 --> 16:42.539
I need to learn.

16:42.541 --> 16:44.207
Kay, well then, pull in.

16:44.209 --> 16:45.608
Don't need to learn, bruh.

16:45.610 --> 16:47.410
- Am I gonna hit that?
- Just park.

16:47.412 --> 16:49.846
You have to re-attack it.

16:49.848 --> 16:52.514
- Oh, my God.
- Back up. Back up.

16:52.516 --> 16:55.116
Imagine how good I'm
gonna be at driving though?

16:55.118 --> 16:56.618
Like, after all of this, I'm gonna be,

16:56.620 --> 16:58.119
like, really good at driving.

16:58.921 --> 17:02.391
Victor. Victor. Wait,
what are you doing?

17:02.393 --> 17:04.925
- This is how parking works.
- No, Victor.

17:04.928 --> 17:06.561
Stop...

17:06.564 --> 17:09.964
So it was your mother's
statue that went missing

17:09.967 --> 17:14.202
and your Driver's Ed car
at the scene of the crime.

17:14.204 --> 17:18.240
Wouldn't you say that was intriguing?

17:18.242 --> 17:21.477
I mean, I wouldn't exactly
call it "The DaVinci Code."

17:22.980 --> 17:24.480
Hostility.

17:24.482 --> 17:29.149
Often the cloak of a
man who feels guilt.

17:29.151 --> 17:30.951
Well, I didn't steal the statue, so...

17:34.323 --> 17:37.892
I wasn't talking about that, Jack.

17:37.894 --> 17:40.461
I was talking about your mother.

17:40.463 --> 17:43.998
You didn't spend much time
with her in her final years,

17:44.000 --> 17:46.100
did you, Jack?

17:46.102 --> 17:49.504
Some, yeah, not much.

17:49.506 --> 17:50.971
We spoke on the phone quite a bit...

17:50.973 --> 17:52.473
I was busy.

17:52.475 --> 17:58.513
We're all busy, Jack,
but we also make choices.

17:59.848 --> 18:01.214
Did you...

18:09.858 --> 18:11.825
It must weigh heavy on you.

18:11.827 --> 18:17.363
All the trips home you canceled
because a meeting came up.

18:17.365 --> 18:20.366
All the birthdays you missed

18:20.368 --> 18:24.671
because you were out
making a name for yourself.

18:24.673 --> 18:26.372
Do you even know

18:26.374 --> 18:30.376
what your mother's
favorite cake was, Jack?!

18:31.880 --> 18:33.279
Easy. Choc...

18:33.281 --> 18:34.480
Carrot!

18:34.482 --> 18:35.881
Yep, carrot.

18:35.883 --> 18:37.984
You were about to say chocolate.

18:37.986 --> 18:39.352
That's funny. I feel like...

18:39.354 --> 18:41.387
I feel like I heard myself say carrot.

19:04.512 --> 19:08.681
I'll tell you why you
stole your mother's statue.

19:08.683 --> 19:10.883
Because you resent us

19:10.885 --> 19:13.085
because we were there
for her when you were not.

19:13.087 --> 19:14.820
No! That's not true.

19:14.822 --> 19:17.255
That's not true. No.

19:17.257 --> 19:20.225
You took advantage of her
when she was old and weak.

19:20.227 --> 19:22.160
- Did we?
- Mm-hmm.

19:22.162 --> 19:26.866
Or did we give her the
company you failed to provide?

19:26.868 --> 19:29.401
Admit it! For her!

19:33.875 --> 19:36.108
Yeah, yes.

19:36.110 --> 19:38.043
Yes, I feel guilty.

19:38.045 --> 19:40.212
I should have been there for my mom,

19:40.214 --> 19:42.080
and I wasn't.

19:42.082 --> 19:43.715
All right, yeah, okay, I was selfish

19:43.717 --> 19:46.684
and I let her die alone and
I should have been there.

19:46.686 --> 19:50.889
And that's why you stole the statue.

19:50.891 --> 19:52.724
Okay.

20:00.800 --> 20:02.334
Hm.

20:06.306 --> 20:08.473
It appears a miracle has occurred

20:08.475 --> 20:12.444
and your mother's
statue has been returned.

20:15.081 --> 20:18.815
Wow. Cool. So you got your statue back?

20:18.817 --> 20:20.217
- Yep.
- That's great.

20:20.219 --> 20:21.385
Yeah, and I was here the whole time

20:21.387 --> 20:23.254
so it couldn't have been me.

20:23.256 --> 20:26.890
Holy cow... wow.

20:26.892 --> 20:31.228
Stuff got crazy in here for
a second there, didn't it?

20:31.230 --> 20:34.998
I'm sorry. You guys seem nice.

20:35.000 --> 20:38.169
All right, well...

20:38.171 --> 20:41.505
I'm outta here.

20:44.743 --> 20:46.143
Spooky day, huh?

20:46.145 --> 20:47.578
You guys did good.

20:47.580 --> 20:50.346
Here, I swiped this off the desk.

20:50.348 --> 20:53.349
- Thanks, Mr. Griffin.
- Mm-hmm.

20:55.287 --> 20:58.688
Oh, and, uh...

20:58.690 --> 21:01.291
I want you to know I think it's great

21:01.293 --> 21:03.826
that you spend time with your grandma.

21:03.828 --> 21:07.530
You're gonna feel good
about that when she's dead.
