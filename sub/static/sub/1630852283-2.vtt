supposed to take more gems!

00:16.892 --> 00:19.561
They're cursed!

The castle's nearly done,

00:24.775 --> 00:27.319

‐ Glad you asked.

00:27.319 --> 00:30.364
King Randy doesn't have
a giant emerald dong on his castle,

00:30.364 --> 00:33.867

I call it my Cock Tower.

00:33.867 --> 00:36.703
Feast your eyes, Randy! Cock Tower!

00:36.703 --> 00:40.249
I just wish I could let all
the kings know how wealthy I am.

00:40.249 --> 00:43.794
But how do I quickly get word out
that I'm rich and everyone else is poor?

00:43.794 --> 00:46.004

00:46.004 --> 00:48.757

00:53.220 --> 00:55.514
Knocked up by the landscaper's son.

01:02.980 --> 01:04.690
‐ From Blossom's boarding school.

01:04.690 --> 01:07.401
Seems like things haven't changed
since I was a student there.

01:07.401 --> 01:09.528
It's still a hot bed of gossip.

01:09.528 --> 01:11.572
A hot gos‐bed.

01:11.572 --> 01:13.740

morning announcements,

01:30.299 --> 01:33.802

King Merriman, who, quote,

01:33.802 --> 01:35.637
"Has a big‐ass secret to tell you,

01:35.637 --> 01:38.807
and also loves his daughter
Blossom very much."

01:38.807 --> 01:41.852
‐ Oh my god...

01:41.852 --> 01:43.729

01:56.200 --> 01:59.036

01:59.036 --> 02:01.288
The King Merriman Mindfulness Center

02:01.288 --> 02:03.290
Slash Butterfly Sanctuary.

02:03.290 --> 02:05.751
Butterflies are basically sexy moths,

02:05.751 --> 02:07.461
so why wouldn't I save them?

02:09.713 --> 02:11.173
‐ You're losing them.

02:11.173 --> 02:13.884
Tell them what you're
about to say is a secret.

02:13.884 --> 02:15.219
‐ What I'm about to say

02:15.219 --> 02:17.179

‐ Did he say a secret?

02:17.179 --> 02:19.681
‐ Is the secret that you sit to pee?

02:19.681 --> 02:21.350
‐ My secret is...

02:21.350 --> 02:24.061
my kingdom has more gems than dirt.

02:24.061 --> 02:26.188
I'm basically ejaculating
gold at this point.

02:26.188 --> 02:28.065
‐ I replaced my nipples with gems.

02:29.399 --> 02:32.152
‐ Keep your tits in your top, vodka‐veins!

02:32.152 --> 02:35.239
‐ Please do not tell anyone
about our extraordinary wealth,

02:35.239 --> 02:37.699
especially not your
king and queen parents.

02:37.699 --> 02:41.245
I'm looking at you, Druella.

02:41.245 --> 02:44.164
‐ To honor this generous,
unnecessary gift,

02:44.164 --> 02:47.793
the Silver Spoons will kick off
the dedication ceremony.

02:55.676 --> 02:57.845
‐ Ugh! Which one of you is flat?

02:57.845 --> 03:00.597
‐ I'm a dragon...

03:03.851 --> 03:05.769

03:05.769 --> 03:07.020

03:07.020 --> 03:09.940
‐ This student is on drugs!

03:09.940 --> 03:11.483
‐ Drugs? I know drugs.

03:11.483 --> 03:13.735
Three of my three siblings are on drugs.

03:13.735 --> 03:17.072
No drug abuser heals without
addressing the underlying issues.

03:17.739 --> 03:21.034
<i>How's your relationship with your parents?</i>

03:21.034 --> 03:23.036
‐ Wrong! You gotta sweat that shit out.

03:23.036 --> 03:24.872
We're going for a jog.

03:26.415 --> 03:29.543
‐ Let's not let this distract
from my wife's gem nipples!

03:29.543 --> 03:32.171
And my generous donation
of a mindfulness center

03:32.171 --> 03:34.715

I'm a dragon!

03:34.715 --> 03:37.009
Ah!

03:38.427 --> 03:40.846

03:46.018 --> 03:47.644
It's a massacre!

03:50.147 --> 03:52.649
We have to put a stop to this drug crisis!

03:52.649 --> 03:55.819
‐ Agreed! We've never had
a drug problem here before.

03:55.819 --> 03:58.155
‐ I mean, how else will word
get out to the other kingdoms

03:58.155 --> 03:59.865
how rich and powerful I've become

03:59.865 --> 04:02.576
if everyone's worried about their
dumbass druggie daughters?

04:02.576 --> 04:06.121
Wasted schoolgirls is a way
sexier story than my gems.

04:06.121 --> 04:07.789
‐ Ahem!
‐ I mean,

04:07.789 --> 04:10.083
I‐I'm so worried about the kids.

04:10.083 --> 04:11.752
It's all about those kids.

04:11.752 --> 04:15.255
‐ Our little girl goes here, and she's
very susceptible to peer pressure.

04:15.255 --> 04:18.592
If there are drugs,
she will absolutely do the drugs.

04:18.592 --> 04:20.802
‐ That's it. I'm putting
my best men on the case.

04:24.223 --> 04:26.016
Um, I'm putting my...

04:26.016 --> 04:28.769

04:33.732 --> 04:35.317
MUSIC TEACHER:
Exciting news, everyone.

04:35.317 --> 04:37.694
Gina's in the hospital
due to a missing larynx.

04:39.112 --> 04:40.948
That is not the exciting news.

04:41.949 --> 04:45.661
Since Gina will no longer be singing lead,

04:45.661 --> 04:49.164
we will have a new round
of solo auditions!

04:49.164 --> 04:50.165
Oh!

04:50.582 --> 04:51.834
You can clap now.

04:54.253 --> 04:56.171
That's right! The only time

04:56.171 --> 04:58.131
I get to openly criticize you

04:58.131 --> 05:00.592

05:00.592 --> 05:02.761
‐ Auditions?! I should be the lead!

05:02.761 --> 05:05.764
My parents gave a lot
of money to this school.

05:05.764 --> 05:06.765
This morning...

05:06.765 --> 05:08.725

05:08.725 --> 05:10.978
Everyone's parents give a lot of money.

05:10.978 --> 05:12.604
If I make you lead,

05:12.604 --> 05:14.773
I have to make everyone lead!

05:14.773 --> 05:16.692
‐ Can I pretty please be extra lead?

05:16.692 --> 05:18.360
‐ You can audition like everyone else.

05:18.360 --> 05:19.278

05:25.742 --> 05:28.912

‐ Why are we doing this?

22:37.736 --> 22:39.196
‐ Active shooter protocols.

22:39.196 --> 22:42.116
Shelter in place, stay quiet,
write your loved ones.

22:42.116 --> 22:44.076
‐ Ah! Oh my god!

22:44.660 --> 22:46.203
Active shooter?

22:46.203 --> 22:48.288
Does this happen a lot?
‐ No, no, no.

22:48.288 --> 22:51.208
Well, not enough to enact
meaningful arrow reform.

22:51.208 --> 22:53.711
Anyway, let me give you
the lay of the land.

22:53.711 --> 22:55.671
Those are the active shooters.

22:57.381 --> 22:59.008
‐ Ugh...

23:35.753 --> 23:37.588
CHILD:
<i>That was amazing.</i>
