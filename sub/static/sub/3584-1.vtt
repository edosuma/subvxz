00:30.303 --> 00:33.938
<i>LOTTE ENTERTAINMENT PRESENTS.</i>

00:43.884 --> 00:47.818
<i>A TRINITY ENTERTAINMENT
PRODUCTION.</i>

01:08.789 --> 01:11.246
There's a black out!

01:11.815 --> 01:14.939
- Do you think there's a problem?
- No, I don't think so.

01:14.940 --> 01:18.935
The temperature's dropping in the
CEO's room on the 29th floor.

01:19.903 --> 01:22.200
Have you checked the
transformer room?

01:22.670 --> 01:25.195
We sent someone there.

01:25.196 --> 01:27.293
Check the CEO's room again.

01:42.372 --> 01:44.198
The power cables have been cut!

01:44.199 --> 01:47.763
<i>We have an intruder! Everyone
move to the 29th floor!</i>

01:47.764 --> 01:49.592
<i>Secure the CEO's room!</i>

01:55.823 --> 01:57.619
What happened?

01:57.620 --> 02:00.176
The safe has been robbed!

02:00.177 --> 02:03.502
<i>Burglary on the 29th floor!
Burglary on the 29th floor!</i>

02:03.512 --> 02:05.569
<i>Shut the exits and
search thoroughly!</i>

02:09.304 --> 02:11.601
- Follow me! Quick!
- Yes, sir!

02:19.849 --> 02:21.446
There's no one in Section D.

02:21.447 --> 02:23.274
- Did you call police?
- Yes, sir.

02:23.284 --> 02:24.842
- That way!
- Yes, sir.

02:29.705 --> 02:31.102
Who's there?

02:31.103 --> 02:33.199
Suspect found! Send more guards!

02:33.200 --> 02:35.127
He's taking the fire escape!

02:35.128 --> 02:36.596
We need more guards!

02:42.587 --> 02:44.445
Where did he go?

02:44.455 --> 02:46.342
- You go that way!
- Yes, sir!

02:46.352 --> 02:47.750
Check the fire escape.

03:00.662 --> 03:03.358
Quick! Hurry!

03:09.420 --> 03:12.475
- Did you see anything?
- He's not on the roof.

03:36.611 --> 03:39.108
It's completely busted!

03:40.436 --> 03:42.732
You troublemaker...

03:42.733 --> 03:44.071
Ouch.

03:45.599 --> 03:48.224
Bro, I think I broke my rib.

03:48.225 --> 03:50.392
Move over. I'll do it.

03:54.017 --> 03:55.215
You okay?

03:58.051 --> 04:02.504
You shouldn't have
gone by yourself!

04:02.505 --> 04:05.370
We're a team!

04:05.371 --> 04:07.966
What are you doing?

04:07.967 --> 04:10.463
Okay! I'll take you
to the hospital.

04:10.464 --> 04:12.231
Put that down.

04:20.350 --> 04:22.945
I don't know what to say.

04:22.946 --> 04:24.974
Why the hell did you do that?

04:30.266 --> 04:33.960
This man can make us big
money at the auction.

04:33.961 --> 04:36.227
Did you hurt your head?

04:36.228 --> 04:38.424
You think you can fool Dr. Min?

04:38.425 --> 04:41.271
If you can, I'll call you uncle.

04:41.291 --> 04:43.387
You're right.

04:43.388 --> 04:47.211
We did a material analysis.

04:47.212 --> 04:52.035
It's a 1940s sculpture of a phoenix
by the master sculptor, Yoo Tae Seok.

04:52.036 --> 04:53.174
I told you.

04:54.272 --> 04:57.427
- I want $500,000 or more.
- $500,000?

04:57.428 --> 04:59.194
Dr. Min needs security.

04:59.195 --> 05:02.590
As you know, this is
some valuable stuff.

05:02.591 --> 05:04.848
Enough bullshit.

05:04.858 --> 05:07.554
I know this is fake.

05:09.012 --> 05:12.347
I'm calling the cops.

05:15.143 --> 05:18.399
So you don't deal any fakes?

05:19.038 --> 05:23.192
Then why did you sell a fake vase
at the Gong Kong auction last year?

05:24.460 --> 05:26.457
The vase from Ming Dynasty.

05:27.825 --> 05:32.319
I know you did that because
of your gambling debt.

05:37.512 --> 05:40.536
The real one is out there somewhere.
We can't auction this.

05:40.537 --> 05:42.005
Real one?

05:43.463 --> 05:45.560
You talking about this?

05:46.559 --> 05:51.792
From now, this is the real one.
Okay?

05:55.986 --> 05:59.281
You're killing me, Lee!

06:01.039 --> 06:04.873
Dr. Min! Are you in there?

06:06.072 --> 06:10.824
If you make us $500,000,
you get 20% commission.

06:10.825 --> 06:12.193
That's $100,000.

06:14.520 --> 06:16.286
You're a natural, bro!

06:16.287 --> 06:20.052
You said you'd call me uncle.

06:21.011 --> 06:24.774
Uncle! I love you uncle!

06:24.775 --> 06:28.899
Minus the commission,
we get $400,000.

06:28.900 --> 06:30.927
Let's go do some business!

06:30.937 --> 06:33.793
What business?

06:40.084 --> 06:43.150
<i>The Technicians.</i>

06:55.962 --> 06:57.299
- You two boys!
- Yes, sir!

06:57.300 --> 06:59.027
- Seung Hyun!
- Follow me!

06:59.996 --> 07:02.293
- Search everywhere!
- Yes, sir!

07:08.214 --> 07:10.011
We're here, Mr. Yoon.
Where are you?

07:10.012 --> 07:13.667
I have followers,
Detective Gong!

07:13.677 --> 07:15.454
Are you sure I'm safe?

07:15.464 --> 07:17.961
You're our informant.
You're protected!

07:17.971 --> 07:21.894
Cho takes care of things himself
or sends his right arm.

07:21.895 --> 07:24.161
My boys are with both
of them right now.

07:24.162 --> 07:27.356
<i>Whatever! See you at
the meeting place.</i>

07:27.357 --> 07:31.411
Okay, let's see some results.

07:31.412 --> 07:33.619
What an idiot!

07:37.074 --> 07:39.629
- He's not here.
- I know.

07:39.630 --> 07:41.857
- Sorry?
- Start the car!

07:53.880 --> 07:55.977
You asshole!

08:12.654 --> 08:19.944
I'm sorry, sir. I'm sorry, sir.

08:20.613 --> 08:25.765
You're a good accountant,
but you talk too much.

08:25.775 --> 08:29.960
You've worked hard.

08:29.970 --> 08:31.697
Take a break.

08:33.764 --> 08:36.260
I have something to say, sir!

08:36.260 --> 08:39.217
I have something to tell you!

08:51.040 --> 08:53.237
Put that away!

08:53.766 --> 08:56.422
We've wasted too much
money on that already!

08:56.432 --> 08:59.188
What if I succeed?

09:00.587 --> 09:02.083
Succeed?

09:02.084 --> 09:05.110
Do you need a reminder?

09:05.120 --> 09:11.710
My bills are perfect! The
ink, paper, and watermark!

09:11.711 --> 09:13.199
But you!

09:13.209 --> 09:17.332
Your ink doesn't stick
and it rubs off.

09:17.333 --> 09:20.658
You call that ink?

09:22.056 --> 09:24.024
Take a look.

09:32.981 --> 09:35.368
The ink tone is perfect.

09:35.378 --> 09:40.729
And so is the viscosity,
concentration, and durability!

09:40.730 --> 09:42.187
You finally got it?

09:42.188 --> 09:44.175
But...

09:44.315 --> 09:45.892
it's weak to alcohol.

09:45.893 --> 09:48.488
Alcohol? Adhesion problem?

09:48.489 --> 09:51.115
That could be an advantage.

09:51.116 --> 09:52.453
What do you mean?

09:52.454 --> 09:56.039
I'm not good with forged money.

09:56.049 --> 09:57.177
I quit.

09:58.206 --> 10:00.572
You're always like this!

10:01.301 --> 10:03.567
- Where you going?
- On a date!

10:03.568 --> 10:05.386
Date?

10:07.093 --> 10:08.931
I'm starved.

10:09.330 --> 10:12.525
- What?
- I talked to him directly.

10:12.526 --> 10:15.012
We have nothing to lose.

10:15.022 --> 10:20.413
But I'm still not convinced. So
can you talk to him directly?

10:20.414 --> 10:26.096
So all he wants is to exhibit
his painting of his ideal girl?

10:26.106 --> 10:28.313
Sounds like a wacko.

10:29.502 --> 10:32.288
I agree. Miss Oh, wait!

10:32.298 --> 10:36.522
He looks like a swindler, but
I think he's being sincere.

10:37.490 --> 10:40.986
- Is that him?
- Yes, that's him.

10:44.411 --> 10:45.939
Hello.

10:59.190 --> 11:01.516
<i>This is nonsense!</i>

11:01.517 --> 11:04.551
I know it's nonsense!

11:04.552 --> 11:08.137
But we can't just
let this chance go.

11:08.147 --> 11:14.029
You know this is my father's last
present to me before he passed away.

11:14.039 --> 11:15.965
I know that.

11:15.966 --> 11:20.090
And you don't want to
lose it at any cost.

11:20.091 --> 11:22.218
You understand me, right?

11:22.228 --> 11:27.949
Then let me direct all exhibitions,
and raise my share to 30%.

11:27.950 --> 11:30.325
That's crazy, Miss Oh!

11:30.326 --> 11:31.654
No?

11:33.212 --> 11:35.838
- Too bad, then.
- Wait.

11:35.839 --> 11:37.616
That's all you want then?

11:38.005 --> 11:41.500
I'm not that greedy.
Just trust me.

11:41.501 --> 11:44.026
- Invest $1 million in a gallery?
- Yeah.

11:44.027 --> 11:46.353
It's a legal investment.

11:46.354 --> 11:48.490
Investment, my ass!

11:48.491 --> 11:51.815
Are you sure she's
not a con artist?

11:51.816 --> 11:54.073
How lame!

11:54.083 --> 11:56.938
I knew you were up to no good.

11:56.939 --> 11:58.905
Turn around. I'm going home.

11:58.906 --> 12:01.901
Then you're not interested
in that big case?

12:01.902 --> 12:06.225
- You planning something big?
- $3 million.

12:06.226 --> 12:08.222
Three million dollars?

12:08.223 --> 12:11.258
So $1 million for that gold
digger, and $2 million for us?

12:11.259 --> 12:16.081
- I thought this was lame!
- I was joking.

12:16.082 --> 12:18.408
Should I look into a site?

12:18.409 --> 12:21.004
Yeah, and a good hacker.

12:21.005 --> 12:22.802
Okay.

12:22.803 --> 12:24.790
Who would be good for this?

12:53.400 --> 12:55.896
Just a moment.

13:08.409 --> 13:09.807
Freeze!

13:11.934 --> 13:13.791
Geez!

13:16.827 --> 13:20.391
So what happened?

13:20.392 --> 13:23.756
Stocks would fall if the
security company went haywire.

13:23.757 --> 13:28.879
Then he'll raise share ratio
and become a shareholder.

13:28.880 --> 13:31.546
What a smart guy!

13:34.702 --> 13:36.499
Smoking's bad for you.

13:37.198 --> 13:39.664
- There's a strange rumor about you.
- What?

13:39.665 --> 13:42.121
That Chicken Foot went
to jail because of you.

13:42.131 --> 13:43.658
He betrayed me first.

13:43.659 --> 13:45.725
Be careful in this business.

13:45.726 --> 13:49.111
I said it wasn't me!
Don't you trust me?

13:49.121 --> 13:50.649
No, I don't.

13:52.217 --> 13:54.314
I don't trust the rumor.

13:55.512 --> 13:57.708
Get changed. Let's
go for an interview!

13:57.709 --> 13:59.366
Really?

13:59.367 --> 14:01.534
- I got you!
- No you didn't!

14:03.331 --> 14:05.099
What interview?

14:28.496 --> 14:29.594
Look.

14:29.595 --> 14:31.820
Quit scanning me. What
kind of interview is this?

14:31.821 --> 14:34.657
You look like a traitor.

14:36.485 --> 14:37.683
Bro!

14:38.282 --> 14:42.545
- I told you it wasn't me!
- It wasn't him!

14:42.546 --> 14:44.702
Let's drink and talk
about business!

14:44.703 --> 14:50.126
You must be a good actor,
to be a good traitor!

14:50.136 --> 14:52.422
Why the hell did
you bring me here?

14:52.432 --> 14:54.220
Sit.

14:54.230 --> 14:57.286
You can't do business
being such a sissy!

14:58.584 --> 15:00.720
Sit down.

15:00.721 --> 15:02.149
Have a drink.

15:02.748 --> 15:05.513
- You're in because of your looks.
- Bullshit.

15:05.514 --> 15:06.573
Cheers!

15:08.140 --> 15:10.507
Hey, Turbo! You
have time tomorrow?

15:13.703 --> 15:19.425
The highway stretches out
in three directions...

15:31.538 --> 15:33.434
Ta-da!

15:33.435 --> 15:34.532
What do you think?

15:34.533 --> 15:36.400
Look over there.

15:36.401 --> 15:38.627
It's far from the highway.

15:38.628 --> 15:42.621
No one would know if you
dropped a bomb or two.

15:42.622 --> 15:44.458
But it's a bit expensive.

15:44.459 --> 15:49.243
But look at the place!
It's perfect for you!

15:49.253 --> 15:55.303
You can flee in three directions
to Songpa, Seongnam, and Guri.

15:55.304 --> 15:56.373
Hey.

15:57.102 --> 15:59.029
Enough bullshit.

15:59.039 --> 16:03.162
What? You a soccer
player or something?

16:03.163 --> 16:07.087
This site belongs to the government.
You're not the owner.

16:07.088 --> 16:10.552
Give me that.

16:10.553 --> 16:15.475
It says, "Construction completion
is deferred until 2015."

16:15.476 --> 16:17.073
What does that mean?

16:17.074 --> 16:19.469
Anyone can use this for a year.

16:19.470 --> 16:24.432
So this isn't yours. It
belongs to the government.

16:24.433 --> 16:25.891
He's right.

16:25.901 --> 16:28.057
How annoying!

16:28.058 --> 16:32.152
We'll give you commission. Okay?

16:33.191 --> 16:34.289
Hey!

16:36.446 --> 16:39.143
He's a funny guy!

16:49.498 --> 16:52.393
You think you're so hot?
I bet chicks dig you.

16:52.394 --> 16:54.052
What a man!

16:54.062 --> 16:57.356
I only wanted the
commission anyway.

16:57.357 --> 17:01.082
- I'll pay you later.
- Later?

17:01.511 --> 17:02.480
Damn it!

17:02.481 --> 17:04.376
- Let's go.
- Where?

17:04.377 --> 17:06.005
Field research.

17:06.503 --> 17:07.662
You're off?

17:07.663 --> 17:08.960
Turbo!

17:08.961 --> 17:12.226
This place needs a clean-up.
It's so dirty!

17:12.236 --> 17:15.960
Look at the dust! Look!

17:15.961 --> 17:17.259
Chill.

17:20.185 --> 17:23.381
And Seongnam's that way, fool!

17:26.017 --> 17:31.409
Give me the commission
this month.

17:33.137 --> 17:36.361
"The Jewelry Street"
is our target.

17:36.362 --> 17:39.397
<i>Chinese people overseas are
investing in jewelry these days.</i>

17:39.398 --> 17:45.919
<i>VVS1 diamonds are $100,000 each.
Thirty would be $3 million.</i>

18:35.419 --> 18:39.073
Where did Turbo
put all my stuff?

18:39.074 --> 18:42.339
I can't find my tool box!

18:42.340 --> 18:46.233
The whole street is overseen
by "Cops Security Company".

18:46.234 --> 18:48.260
I'll erase their
record when you go in.

18:48.261 --> 18:49.260
Hey!

18:49.261 --> 18:52.225
We need to get into the VIP
room to check things out.

18:52.226 --> 18:54.782
Should I make a fake diamond?

18:54.792 --> 18:57.048
We can't fool them with that.

18:57.049 --> 18:59.445
Then how do we get
into the VIP room?

18:59.446 --> 19:02.312
- Leave it to me.
- How?

19:03.110 --> 19:04.938
What are you thinking?

19:06.306 --> 19:11.328
I'm happy that you see the gallery
as something more than business.

19:11.329 --> 19:15.523
But we still need to do
business to go beyond business.

19:15.533 --> 19:16.650
Right.

19:16.651 --> 19:19.647
If I trust you and invest in the
gallery, what will you give me?

19:19.657 --> 19:22.943
We will exhibit your
work in our gallery...

19:22.953 --> 19:24.710
That's not what I meant.

19:25.709 --> 19:28.904
What can you do for me, Eun Ha?

19:34.297 --> 19:36.792
What are you looking at?

19:36.793 --> 19:41.356
Don't get me wrong. I'm just
looking at your necklace.

19:41.357 --> 19:44.082
I can see it's special.

19:44.083 --> 19:48.316
My dad gave it to my mom
before she passed away.

19:48.317 --> 19:49.945
Must be precious to you.

19:52.741 --> 19:57.864
Do you know how much
that necklace is worth?

20:03.895 --> 20:09.787
Isn't it similar to the Eugenie Blue
diamond of the empress of Napoleon III?

20:10.785 --> 20:12.812
You know the industry well.

20:12.813 --> 20:17.076
It's also a top FL class
with a rare marquise cut.

20:17.077 --> 20:20.131
Will you follow me to
the VIP room, sir?

20:20.132 --> 20:22.599
That's okay. We'll
come back later.

20:23.028 --> 20:25.594
It's my first time seeing
something like this.

20:25.595 --> 20:30.217
This is a valuable collectible
item in the top wealthy class.

20:30.218 --> 20:32.545
It's not an ordinary
necklace to wear.

20:32.555 --> 20:35.740
Let's talk inside.

20:37.178 --> 20:38.646
Welcome.

20:39.206 --> 20:41.871
This is our VIP lounge.

20:41.872 --> 20:45.537
I have something similar to this.
Let me show you.

20:46.735 --> 20:49.661
Where was it?

21:03.042 --> 21:06.037
Were you going to hold
this as a collateral?

21:06.038 --> 21:10.830
Your mother's necklace?
I'm not that cheap.

21:10.831 --> 21:13.857
Can you promise me something?

21:14.726 --> 21:15.724
What promise?

21:15.725 --> 21:21.576
Promise you'll trust me
no matter what happens.

21:21.586 --> 21:23.743
What do you mean?

21:29.105 --> 21:32.531
Should I trust him?

21:35.027 --> 21:37.763
No idea.

21:57.566 --> 22:00.031
Did you get the nomination?

22:00.032 --> 22:02.458
Damn politicians!

22:02.459 --> 22:04.126
I wasn't nominated.

22:08.850 --> 22:12.604
There's a rumor that the
money's going to be moved.

22:12.614 --> 22:14.840
- Then what?
- We have to hurry.

22:14.841 --> 22:18.964
Start looking for some
good con artists.

22:18.965 --> 22:20.163
Yes, sir.

22:20.164 --> 22:25.057
Let's rob those politicians.

22:28.652 --> 22:32.486
Mr. Oh would've been
perfect for this job.

22:33.645 --> 22:38.009
I miss my old friend.

23:28.708 --> 23:31.533
Wait! I can do it!

23:31.534 --> 23:33.830
Give me another chance, sir!

23:42.518 --> 23:48.979
Swiss M series, 100% fireproof.

23:51.775 --> 23:54.561
This is our VIP lounge.

23:54.571 --> 23:58.596
I have something similar.
Let me show you.

24:01.951 --> 24:03.469
<i>[KOO IN]</i>

24:13.744 --> 24:16.401
Damn you, bastard!

24:29.522 --> 24:33.246
We'll check what
set off the alarm.

24:33.247 --> 24:34.975
Okay, sir.

24:35.813 --> 24:38.968
<i>- How many times has it gone off this week?
- What's going on?</i>

24:38.969 --> 24:40.805
It's so loud!

24:40.806 --> 24:43.962
I bet it was just a drunkard.

24:48.555 --> 24:51.681
Okay. All clear on this side.

24:55.186 --> 24:58.282
- Something's wrong.
- What's going on?

24:59.310 --> 25:02.855
Get ready to throw the bait.

25:06.530 --> 25:09.396
- What's the problem?
- I don't see anything.

25:12.921 --> 25:16.187
<i>I think it was an error.
We can just reset it.</i>

25:18.354 --> 25:21.459
<i>Shutting off police radio.</i>

25:22.847 --> 25:25.214
Okay! Now!

25:28.869 --> 25:30.366
<i>What the hell?</i>

25:30.367 --> 25:36.357
- Damn it!
- Fire on 107-06!

25:36.358 --> 25:38.485
<i>Fire on 107-06!</i>

25:40.383 --> 25:42.179
Nothing special here.

25:42.180 --> 25:43.847
Gentlemen...

25:43.848 --> 25:45.485
<i>It's show time!</i>

26:44.393 --> 26:47.069
So many damn screws!

26:55.877 --> 26:58.142
<i>- Did you call 911?
- Yeah.</i>

26:58.143 --> 26:59.711
<i>What's taking them so long?</i>

27:04.964 --> 27:06.002
Stop!

27:07.860 --> 27:08.868
Go!

27:09.697 --> 27:13.092
Cops can hear over 130dB.

27:18.814 --> 27:19.713
What?

27:19.714 --> 27:22.210
The shop's not soundproof.
I can hear the drill.

27:25.076 --> 27:27.862
- Wait.
- Yes?

27:27.872 --> 27:29.599
Do you hear that?

27:30.069 --> 27:31.826
Stop! Stop!

27:33.664 --> 27:34.892
Go!

27:38.517 --> 27:41.383
Guys! Cops are heading your way!

27:42.811 --> 27:45.677
Stop! Ji Hyuk, stop!

27:46.446 --> 27:48.543
Cops are coming! Stop!

27:57.660 --> 28:00.155
Are you crazy? Cops are coming!

28:00.156 --> 28:03.721
Cops are almost there!
Get out of there!

28:05.179 --> 28:07.476
I'm out of here.

28:09.713 --> 28:13.437
Buy me more time, Bro.

28:13.438 --> 28:14.536
More time?

28:17.931 --> 28:19.899
You think that's easy?

28:53.452 --> 28:54.650
What the hell?

28:58.774 --> 29:00.671
Someone broke the window!

29:35.992 --> 29:38.349
You scared me!

30:01.686 --> 30:05.450
- Did you erase your fingerprints?
- Of course!

30:07.548 --> 30:09.005
Let's go!

30:11.402 --> 30:14.896
I'm sorry, sir. I'll
take care of it.

30:14.897 --> 30:20.688
They fooled the cops and opened
the M series safe in 5 minutes.

30:20.689 --> 30:24.923
They're the ones I need.

30:26.321 --> 30:27.918
Find them.

30:27.919 --> 30:30.575
Let's see who they are.

30:33.211 --> 30:34.908
<i>They're rare diamonds.</i>

30:34.909 --> 30:38.534
<i>There aren't many brokers in
the country who can deal them.</i>

30:39.503 --> 30:41.560
Get to the brokers first.

30:47.691 --> 30:52.514
Loyalty won't save you.

30:53.813 --> 30:55.730
Understood?

30:56.738 --> 30:58.775
<i>Take a look at this.</i>

30:58.776 --> 30:59.704
What's that?

30:59.705 --> 31:02.429
You know about the
jewelry shop robbery?

31:02.430 --> 31:04.666
- The cops are taking care of that.
- There's something strange.

31:04.667 --> 31:09.251
After the shop was robbed, stolen
good brokers started disappearing.

31:09.261 --> 31:11.287
What are you getting at?

31:11.288 --> 31:12.546
Sir.

31:12.556 --> 31:16.181
The robbed shop belongs
to Cho Dae Jin.

31:16.650 --> 31:19.845
The suitcase was the
cause of the fire.

31:19.846 --> 31:24.798
But instead of the shop where fire
broke out, the other one was robbed.

31:24.799 --> 31:27.835
And they even took out all
of the security cameras.

31:28.634 --> 31:33.626
They must've planned damn well
for something of this scale.

31:33.627 --> 31:36.681
It means that we'll never
be as smart as them.

31:36.682 --> 31:40.676
So what do we do? Get
busy on our feet!

31:40.677 --> 31:44.440
Get all the surveillance
and evidence in the area.

31:44.441 --> 31:46.438
I'm sure we'll get
something then.

31:46.439 --> 31:48.165
- Action!
- Yes, sir!

31:48.166 --> 31:50.233
Move! Follow me!

32:05.642 --> 32:09.167
Ever seen anything like these?

32:09.177 --> 32:12.173
- Who stole them?
- None of your business!

32:12.732 --> 32:17.445
- Was it Koo In?
- Wow. No way!

32:18.693 --> 32:21.089
Let me know if anyone
wants to buy them.

32:21.090 --> 32:22.090
Okay.

32:23.816 --> 32:25.284
I'm off.

32:48.122 --> 32:49.280
Hey.

32:56.940 --> 32:59.235
I told a dealer I trust.

32:59.236 --> 33:01.003
He'll call us if
anyone's interested.

33:01.004 --> 33:02.161
Good! Well done!

33:02.162 --> 33:04.000
- I'll be back.
- Okay.

33:14.884 --> 33:17.640
<i>Name, Lee Ji Hyuk. Age, 31.</i>

33:17.641 --> 33:21.534
An orphan and majored
in art in college.

33:21.535 --> 33:23.901
He has no criminal record?

33:23.902 --> 33:27.966
Why is he so unknown
in this field?

33:28.995 --> 33:33.518
- You sure about this?
- I'll check again, sir.

33:37.513 --> 33:38.910
She looks familiar.

33:38.911 --> 33:41.178
I don't think she's
anyone special.

33:41.777 --> 33:44.142
Name, Kim Koo In. Age, 42.

33:44.143 --> 33:48.466
An engineer with connections
in the industry.

33:48.467 --> 33:49.525
Next?

33:49.526 --> 33:51.462
Name, Park Jong Bae. Age, 25.

33:51.463 --> 33:53.060
<i>He's a hacker and
camera specialist.</i>

33:53.061 --> 33:58.413
<i>He has a bad reputation for
betraying his colleagues.</i>

33:58.423 --> 34:01.609
One's a decoy, the
other's a camera man.

34:01.619 --> 34:06.402
Then Lee is the one who opened
the safe in five minutes?

34:06.412 --> 34:07.670
I think so.

34:20.522 --> 34:21.989
- Jong Bae!
- Yeah?

34:21.989 --> 34:23.678
Did you erase the video
from the jewel shop?

34:23.688 --> 34:24.985
Working on it.

34:24.985 --> 34:27.911
- Hurry up.
- Almost done.

34:35.101 --> 34:36.101
What the hell?

34:39.466 --> 34:40.466
What?

35:30.624 --> 35:32.052
Lee Ji Hyuk.

35:35.048 --> 35:36.546
Who are you?

35:57.955 --> 35:59.383
All clear.

36:18.287 --> 36:20.852
You've got talent.

36:20.853 --> 36:22.511
Who are you?

36:22.521 --> 36:25.507
People call me Chairman
Cho from Chinatown.

36:25.517 --> 36:28.971
Now I run a sound
business in Seoul.

36:28.972 --> 36:35.532
What's a chairman doing
in such a shabby place?

36:35.533 --> 36:38.628
Work under me for a big case.

36:42.323 --> 36:48.843
I don't work under anyone.

36:48.844 --> 36:50.342
Fine, then.

36:51.510 --> 36:55.634
Lock them up until they
change their mind.

37:05.760 --> 37:09.355
Why isn't he answering
all of a sudden?

37:10.554 --> 37:15.207
He's not as easy as I thought.

37:17.644 --> 37:19.531
I'm so hungry!

37:19.541 --> 37:22.735
The assholes aren't
even feeding us!

37:22.736 --> 37:27.489
I'm positive this is a
totally unfair deal.

37:27.490 --> 37:33.511
Don't make a deal with them because
we'll become their slaves!

37:33.521 --> 37:37.275
Tell them no, like you promised.

37:37.276 --> 37:41.639
Okay. I get it
already, so relax.

37:41.640 --> 37:44.465
I'm worried you'll
do something silly.

37:44.466 --> 37:49.857
It would be a nightmare
working for Cho!

37:49.858 --> 37:51.356
I'm starved!

38:00.683 --> 38:04.407
So you won't work for me?

38:04.408 --> 38:08.331
It's not that we
won't, but we can't.

38:08.332 --> 38:12.695
You know how much I
respect you, sir.

38:12.696 --> 38:15.821
But the fortuneteller said
we have bad luck this year.

38:15.822 --> 38:20.684
It was bad luck that
we robbed your store.

38:20.685 --> 38:23.310
It was pure chance that
we didn't get caught.

38:23.311 --> 38:26.077
We don't have the
skills or the nerves.

38:26.078 --> 38:30.431
I apologize again for
meddling with your business.

38:30.441 --> 38:33.536
Running a business
is a headache.

38:33.537 --> 38:39.259
It's tough managing people,
especially cheeky ones.

38:40.188 --> 38:46.048
My accountant who used to sit
there is now buried in cement.

38:46.049 --> 38:50.213
I don't want that
to happen to you.

38:50.214 --> 38:53.139
- Me neither.
- Is that a threat?

38:53.140 --> 38:55.107
No.

39:08.148 --> 39:09.686
This is your sister?

39:13.541 --> 39:15.238
And your father?

39:24.665 --> 39:27.420
I'm a nice person.

39:27.421 --> 39:31.614
But business takes
more than passion.

39:31.615 --> 39:36.478
- How big is this business?
- Not big. $50 million.

39:36.479 --> 39:39.375
And $100 million more.

39:40.074 --> 39:44.367
We don't have such big
business in our country.

39:44.368 --> 39:46.325
- What if there is?
- Where?

39:46.335 --> 39:48.201
In Incheon Customs.

39:48.202 --> 39:49.669
What do we get?

39:49.670 --> 39:54.453
The diamonds you stole
and 5% commission each.

39:56.421 --> 39:57.619
Don't do it.

40:08.534 --> 40:09.832
We'll do it.

40:46.680 --> 40:48.448
I'll get our boys behind them.

40:48.907 --> 40:51.772
They won't back out.

40:51.773 --> 40:54.000
Keep an eye on Lee though.

41:03.826 --> 41:05.384
Hey.

41:06.782 --> 41:07.849
Are you mad?

41:07.850 --> 41:10.546
- Am I even your partner?
- Of course.

41:10.547 --> 41:15.668
Then why did you tell
Cho we'd work for him?

41:15.669 --> 41:17.397
And who's that
girl in the photo?

41:17.407 --> 41:22.729
- I told you I'm seeing a girl.
- What?

41:28.521 --> 41:31.446
The chick you're investing in?

41:31.447 --> 41:32.884
Are you nuts?

41:32.885 --> 41:37.688
Chill out! I know
what I'm doing.

41:38.837 --> 41:41.773
Do you know who Cho is?

41:42.901 --> 41:44.659
Nope. Let's talk later.

41:44.669 --> 41:48.363
What the hell are you thinking?

41:53.257 --> 41:57.410
Fine then. Let's just
do what Cho asks.

41:57.411 --> 41:59.976
Stay out of trouble.

41:59.977 --> 42:03.471
That's a restaurant
near the jewel shop.

42:03.472 --> 42:06.467
This was taken a day
before the robbery.

42:06.468 --> 42:10.991
He was holding a suitcase at
1:50, but it's gone at 2:40.

42:10.992 --> 42:15.854
It means he left the suitcase at
the shop where the fire broke out.

42:15.855 --> 42:18.450
They forgot to erase the
security camera footage.

42:18.451 --> 42:21.815
But how can we find
them with just this?

42:21.816 --> 42:26.400
Do we have the video of the
restaurant parking lot?

42:26.410 --> 42:28.407
- Yes, sir.
- Let's see.

42:29.805 --> 42:32.730
Fast forward.

42:32.731 --> 42:34.758
Stop! Zoom in.

42:37.255 --> 42:38.583
Got it!

42:38.593 --> 42:40.690
Find the owner of that vehicle.

42:41.888 --> 42:46.642
Koo In, tell me about
Incheon Customs.

42:47.780 --> 42:53.801
<i>It's the first entry point in Korea
for all imports and exports.</i>

42:53.802 --> 42:56.766
<i>It's got the tightest
security system in Asia</i>

42:56.767 --> 42:59.592
<i>with the highest ratio of
filtering for smuggled goods.</i>

42:59.593 --> 43:01.190
Good.

43:01.191 --> 43:05.216
So where did the $150
million come from?

43:06.713 --> 43:10.747
Remember J Group's $80 million
slush fund five years ago?

43:10.748 --> 43:12.674
It's something similar.

43:12.675 --> 43:17.737
The government reappointed the
customs directors for 10 years

43:17.738 --> 43:22.291
and they've kept the slush fund
in customs since 4-5 years ago.

43:22.292 --> 43:27.154
<i>That slush fund lies
where no one knows</i>

43:27.155 --> 43:31.717
<i>and the security
is impenetrable.</i>

43:31.718 --> 43:33.844
150 million dollars!

43:33.845 --> 43:38.299
People have $10 million in
secret funds these days.

43:38.309 --> 43:42.732
For a government, $150 million
in cash isn't big money.

43:42.733 --> 43:47.425
There's a rumor the money
will be moved soon.

43:47.426 --> 43:50.592
We have to get to
it before it does.

43:58.581 --> 44:01.367
This is the model of the
safe you have to open.

44:01.377 --> 44:04.333
The L series from Israel.

44:05.201 --> 44:09.724
The welding machine must run
at max to open this safe!

44:09.725 --> 44:12.321
It can explode, sir.

44:14.758 --> 44:16.456
But I'll try my best.

44:17.554 --> 44:22.406
Here is the ground plan, security blueprint,
and map of telephone wires and sewage system.

44:22.407 --> 44:26.101
How can we move $150 million
through the sewers?

44:26.102 --> 44:29.497
This isn't Europe.
Korean pipes are tiny!

44:32.094 --> 44:37.355
These are ID cards and vehicle
passes for the customs personnel.

44:37.356 --> 44:38.415
Wow!

44:38.425 --> 44:41.449
This is footage taken from
the security company.

44:41.450 --> 44:46.374
A team of two armed guards
patrol secured areas.

44:47.073 --> 44:49.768
<i>50 armed guards standby
in the building.</i>

44:49.769 --> 44:56.229
It takes 10 minutes for the emergency
squad to get anywhere in the customs.

44:56.230 --> 45:00.493
<i>So you have 10 minutes to open the
safe and walk out with $150 million.</i>

45:00.494 --> 45:02.420
<i>Is that possible?</i>

45:02.421 --> 45:08.073
$5 million weighs 100kg. $150
million would be three tons.

45:08.083 --> 45:09.740
No way in hell!

45:09.741 --> 45:11.338
Impossible?

45:12.277 --> 45:14.533
Then how about camera
and infrared sensors?

45:14.534 --> 45:18.597
We can take care of other areas,
but not the secured areas.

45:18.598 --> 45:20.825
There's a bigger problem.

45:21.225 --> 45:22.792
What?

45:24.420 --> 45:31.041
<i>Suppose we fool the surveillance,
sensors, control room, armed guards...</i>

45:31.051 --> 45:33.976
<i>patrol guards, and
emergency standby police.</i>

45:33.977 --> 45:39.599
<i>And we walk out with
$150 million in cash.</i>

45:41.097 --> 45:43.453
How do we get through
the checkpoint?

45:44.492 --> 45:46.189
Can you hack the checkpoint?

45:46.190 --> 45:51.082
If we plant zombies and let
them run for a month...

45:51.083 --> 45:54.078
But we only have two weeks.

45:54.648 --> 45:57.374
Then how can we
get through this?

45:58.372 --> 46:00.030
Exactly.

46:01.168 --> 46:04.853
I can take care of that.

46:07.560 --> 46:10.654
I made a paper company
in China last year.

46:10.655 --> 46:18.075
These coupons cost 10 cents each, and
I've been importing them regularly.

46:18.085 --> 46:23.078
In two weeks, I'll be getting
33 million more coupons.

46:24.336 --> 46:30.268
We can clear the checkpoint
with these coupons.

46:31.166 --> 46:32.594
You get it?

46:34.192 --> 46:39.854
We enter customs and change 10
cent coupons with 50 dollar bills.

46:50.000 --> 46:51.367
Welcome.

46:51.368 --> 46:53.535
Why did you call me?

46:56.031 --> 47:01.084
I know you were gonna backstab
your buddies with this.

47:08.114 --> 47:11.469
You don't know what
you're talking about.

47:11.470 --> 47:15.933
I like people like you.

47:15.934 --> 47:19.958
Cunning and tenacious
like a hyena.

47:23.093 --> 47:27.078
This is a down payment.

47:27.088 --> 47:30.183
Report everything you
see and hear to me.

47:59.742 --> 48:04.464
You're a real thief!
Quiet as a cat!

48:04.465 --> 48:06.363
What brings you here?

48:08.330 --> 48:10.986
To have a drink with you.

48:13.882 --> 48:17.108
When are you going
to quit stealing?

48:17.118 --> 48:23.038
I'll retire after
one last big hit.

48:23.039 --> 48:24.927
You crazy fool.

48:25.136 --> 48:29.690
There is no last
hit for a thief.

48:29.700 --> 48:33.853
Don't think you're Robin Hood.

48:33.854 --> 48:36.850
A thief is nothing but a thief.

48:42.782 --> 48:49.772
I miss you, Mr. Oh.

48:51.899 --> 48:53.866
Have you been busy?

48:54.365 --> 48:58.159
I called you a few times
but you never answered.

48:58.160 --> 48:59.159
I'm sorry.

48:59.160 --> 49:01.384
I've been busy with work.

49:01.385 --> 49:03.153
That's okay.

49:04.311 --> 49:05.649
Eun Ha.

49:06.009 --> 49:07.107
Yes?

49:07.806 --> 49:10.832
Nothing. Good night.

49:10.842 --> 49:12.798
<i>See you tomorrow.</i>

49:12.799 --> 49:14.197
Okay, take care.

49:22.326 --> 49:26.810
We're partnering up with
Belita Museum in Abu Dhabi.

49:26.820 --> 49:30.943
We will be introducing artists
to each others' countries.

49:30.944 --> 49:33.740
Your funding will
be used for that.

49:35.737 --> 49:37.863
Are you thinking
about your business?

49:37.864 --> 49:38.963
Yes.

49:40.700 --> 49:42.927
Look, um...

49:50.047 --> 49:53.611
I'm Detective Gong from the
Regional Investigation Unit.

49:53.612 --> 49:57.277
Can we have a word with you, Mr.
Lee?

50:00.093 --> 50:01.251
<i>Lee Ji Hyuk.</i>

50:01.252 --> 50:04.629
You were in a hotel room when
the crime happened, right?

50:05.129 --> 50:11.762
But we have no witnesses who saw you and
all the security footage is expired.

50:11.763 --> 50:15.450
The cameras at the jewelry
shop are gone, too.

50:15.460 --> 50:19.615
It's funny and
convenient, right?

50:19.616 --> 50:24.412
How many times have you
gotten away with robbery?

50:25.252 --> 50:28.108
I'm telling you again.

50:28.109 --> 50:30.038
I don't know what
you're talking about.

50:30.048 --> 50:31.866
Don't know?

50:35.073 --> 50:36.301
You don't know this suitcase?

50:36.302 --> 50:38.540
Do you have a record
of the crime?

50:39.300 --> 50:42.596
You can't draw up evidence
from circumstance.

50:42.597 --> 50:44.235
You know Cho, right?

50:45.364 --> 50:51.130
I came here out of good manner
but it's already been six hours.

50:51.759 --> 50:55.456
From now on, it's
illegal imprisonment.

50:57.384 --> 51:01.650
I'm going to put you in jail.

51:01.651 --> 51:04.978
Lee Ji Hyuk, you better
watch out, you bastard!

51:29.357 --> 51:30.526
<i>[MR. LEE]</i>

52:33.702 --> 52:35.331
It's me.

52:35.471 --> 52:37.239
I have the Customs plan.

52:38.099 --> 52:42.335
Let's turn those
coupons into money.

53:01.019 --> 53:03.616
Why is the Regional
Investigation Unit here?

53:03.617 --> 53:06.045
I'll check it out, sir.

53:07.474 --> 53:09.242
Bring Lee out.

53:26.927 --> 53:28.025
What?

53:28.026 --> 53:30.994
Why are the cops here?

53:35.889 --> 53:39.046
They're investigating
the jewelry theft case.

53:39.047 --> 53:43.273
Why? Cops scaring you?

53:43.283 --> 53:49.238
Get rid of all evidence of our project.
We're leaving in five minutes.

53:53.474 --> 53:54.234
Hello, sir.

53:54.235 --> 53:56.202
- You sure it's Cho?
- Yes.

53:57.171 --> 53:59.569
Cover the back doors.

54:18.583 --> 54:22.179
I told you Lee's not
an ordinary thief.

54:22.180 --> 54:25.177
- But we can't just barge in like this.
- Shush.

54:28.305 --> 54:29.554
Give me the key.

54:39.195 --> 54:42.333
Hey, assholes!

55:08.011 --> 55:09.040
Sir.

55:09.410 --> 55:10.169
What?

55:10.170 --> 55:12.367
I think you should see this.

55:13.936 --> 55:15.834
There's something here.

55:36.487 --> 55:37.846
What?

55:44.910 --> 55:47.207
It's Incheon Customs.

55:47.208 --> 55:49.106
He's even got the ground floor.

55:54.831 --> 55:59.967
May 14th. Incheon Customs.

56:00.466 --> 56:05.021
Install explosives in the
storage yard in the customs?

56:05.022 --> 56:05.922
Right.

56:05.923 --> 56:10.417
They'll be busy dealing with the
explosion while we work on the safe.

56:10.418 --> 56:13.354
Then how will you
enter the customs?

56:13.355 --> 56:16.412
The public office is powerless
under environmental issues.

56:16.413 --> 56:19.409
We'll use the fax number of
the Ministry of Environment

56:19.410 --> 56:24.345
and notify customs that there will be a
water quality inspection in the area.

56:24.346 --> 56:25.405
Thank you!

56:26.204 --> 56:30.170
This bomb-converted-napalm,
which was used in WWII

56:30.171 --> 56:34.996
is inexhaustible and
completely mind-blowing!

56:34.997 --> 56:39.062
Of course I got rid of the
toxic substance in the gas.

56:39.063 --> 56:40.291
This isn't a war.

56:40.292 --> 56:43.359
Make two just in case.

56:43.360 --> 56:45.458
Sure, if you say so.

56:55.080 --> 56:58.376
Who's that? Do we
have a visitor today?

56:58.377 --> 56:59.897
Yeah, from the Ministry
of Environment.

57:13.964 --> 57:16.930
Don't open that.

57:16.931 --> 57:18.000
Hey!

57:19.459 --> 57:22.087
What's the problem now?

57:22.097 --> 57:25.223
This is different. Get
rid of the shelves!

57:25.224 --> 57:29.749
What's the big deal?

57:29.750 --> 57:32.648
I'm older than you!

57:34.217 --> 57:39.111
When the bomb explodes, the alarm will
ring throughout the entire customs.

57:39.112 --> 57:41.839
It'll go off after some time...

57:41.840 --> 57:45.336
Then we'll shut the system down
so the alarm doesn't turn off.

57:45.337 --> 57:51.402
So they'll think something's wrong with the
security system and turn it off themselves?

57:53.430 --> 57:54.728
<i>Exactly.</i>

57:54.729 --> 57:59.694
<i>When we activate the
program through the remote</i>

57:59.695 --> 58:03.121
<i>the system takes about
45 minutes to reboot.</i>

58:03.122 --> 58:06.239
<i>So we have 45 minutes
to open the safe</i>

58:06.249 --> 58:08.546
and walk out with the money?

58:08.547 --> 58:10.056
A bit tight, huh?

58:33.866 --> 58:38.791
You only have 10 minutes to drill the safe,
and five minutes to find the combination.

58:38.792 --> 58:42.887
Practice doesn't suit me. I
work better on the field.

58:42.888 --> 58:43.887
Bullshit!

58:43.888 --> 58:45.685
That's what you said last time!

58:45.686 --> 58:49.851
No one's ever been able
to open this safe.

58:49.852 --> 58:52.479
Look. Even you're
not getting it.

58:52.480 --> 58:54.508
We should've told him we're out.

58:54.518 --> 58:55.577
Bro.

58:56.317 --> 59:02.342
You really think that Cho would keep
his promise with us after all this?

59:04.140 --> 59:05.639
You really believe that?

59:08.666 --> 59:10.334
We have no choice.

59:10.335 --> 59:11.464
Bro.

59:13.502 --> 59:14.761
Trust me.

59:15.830 --> 59:19.087
I found a way to screw Cho over.

59:19.097 --> 59:20.226
Tell me.

59:21.325 --> 59:25.691
We'll fabricate a cargo export
company when we're in the customs.

59:25.692 --> 59:30.817
If we change the company info,
we can have that money.

59:36.113 --> 59:41.207
I've made the paper company,
and forged the documents.

59:41.208 --> 59:44.675
<i>We'll have the
entire $150 million.</i>

59:44.676 --> 59:48.301
<i>- Is that really possible?
- Most likely.</i>

59:48.302 --> 59:53.098
That's what he said.

01:00:00.762 --> 01:00:04.389
Fabricate an export company...

01:00:04.818 --> 01:00:08.484
Fabricate an export company...

01:00:08.485 --> 01:00:11.213
Without me, they couldn't
hack the system.

01:00:12.212 --> 01:00:15.050
What if they didn't
need to hack it?

01:00:17.148 --> 01:00:19.176
I get the picture.

01:00:21.144 --> 01:00:23.472
Timing is the problem.

01:00:33.794 --> 01:00:37.730
Hello! Have a good day!

01:00:39.159 --> 01:00:40.487
Sir.

01:00:40.488 --> 01:00:43.226
<i>We have no trace of them.</i>

01:00:44.155 --> 01:00:49.749
They've vanished! They're
not at work or at home.

01:00:49.750 --> 01:00:51.618
Maybe they have a hiding space.

01:00:51.619 --> 01:00:58.472
Lee met up with Cho! There's
something really fishy there.

01:00:58.473 --> 01:01:02.568
Maybe their evidence
is just bait.

01:01:02.569 --> 01:01:04.308
Let's pull out.

01:01:05.107 --> 01:01:06.536
Pull out the team in the hotel.

01:01:12.461 --> 01:01:14.189
I have more information
on Lee Ji Hyuk.

01:01:14.199 --> 01:01:16.627
I think this is important.

01:01:25.550 --> 01:01:28.617
I knew there was
something strange.

01:01:29.646 --> 01:01:35.310
So Lee has been framing
me from the beginning?

01:01:35.311 --> 01:01:37.139
I think so, sir.

01:01:37.140 --> 01:01:40.207
I knew she looked familiar.

01:01:40.977 --> 01:01:42.405
I'll get rid of him.

01:01:44.034 --> 01:01:50.627
Not yet. The hunt
has just begun.

01:01:50.628 --> 01:01:54.195
You can't kill the
hunting dog already.

01:01:57.193 --> 01:01:59.121
Bye, everyone!

01:02:13.978 --> 01:02:15.048
Eun Ha.

01:02:18.145 --> 01:02:21.301
It's rude of you to
show up like this.

01:02:21.302 --> 01:02:28.566
Do you remember how I asked you
to trust me no matter what?

01:02:30.634 --> 01:02:33.222
Trust what?

01:02:33.232 --> 01:02:35.659
You're getting
something wrong here.

01:02:35.660 --> 01:02:40.426
To me, you're nothing
more than an investor.

01:02:42.554 --> 01:02:46.350
Now I don't feel comfortable
with you at all.

01:02:46.351 --> 01:02:49.248
I'm not making excuses here.

01:02:50.647 --> 01:02:53.045
But this concerns your father.

01:02:55.273 --> 01:03:03.267
<i>Ever wonder why your father
couldn't live with his family?</i>

01:03:04.665 --> 01:03:06.893
What are you talking about?

01:03:06.903 --> 01:03:14.527
What if your father didn't
really die from an accident?

01:03:17.025 --> 01:03:22.090
<i>Your daughter's so cute!
When was this?</i>

01:03:24.089 --> 01:03:26.587
Go see her if you miss her!

01:03:31.043 --> 01:03:35.138
Geez. You drank it
all by yourself!

01:03:35.139 --> 01:03:39.905
Give me a minute. I'll
get us some more booze.

01:04:19.472 --> 01:04:23.537
So it was planned and
you know the suspect?

01:04:23.538 --> 01:04:25.535
So just stake out...

01:04:25.536 --> 01:04:30.123
You want me to hide until
you handle your business?

01:04:30.133 --> 01:04:33.090
I'm not going to do that.

01:04:35.328 --> 01:04:38.984
I don't trust you anymore.

01:04:38.985 --> 01:04:43.880
You approached me with a lie
and used me for your crime.

01:04:43.881 --> 01:04:46.078
I'm sorry I lied to you.

01:04:46.079 --> 01:04:49.145
But now I'm trying to
be honest with you.

01:04:49.146 --> 01:04:51.174
After all these lies?

01:04:51.175 --> 01:04:54.971
- Let me protect you.
- Protect me?

01:04:55.571 --> 01:04:57.539
Just leave me alone.

01:06:24.995 --> 01:06:29.060
We stayed up all night! Are
they really going to do this?

01:06:29.061 --> 01:06:30.960
I think this is a trick.

01:06:41.950 --> 01:06:44.447
I just washed my face, damn it.

01:06:44.448 --> 01:06:49.473
Take it easy, man.

01:06:49.474 --> 01:06:51.442
Show some respect, guys!

01:06:52.112 --> 01:06:57.737
Don't touch that! We
die if that explodes!

01:06:59.765 --> 01:07:03.131
Make sure you have
everything, Jong Bae.

01:07:03.132 --> 01:07:05.450
- Don't worry.
- Okay.

01:07:06.360 --> 01:07:09.787
- Did you get some sleep?
- Yes. Did you?

01:07:09.797 --> 01:07:11.325
Lots of it.

01:07:16.151 --> 01:07:18.250
Good morning, sir.

01:07:41.130 --> 01:07:44.727
<i>[INCHEON PORT MAIN CUSTOMS]</i>

01:07:48.993 --> 01:07:50.192
Hello.

01:07:56.757 --> 01:07:58.584
I'm from the telephone company.

01:07:58.585 --> 01:08:01.182
Yes, we have a telephone
repair scheduled for today.

01:08:01.183 --> 01:08:02.752
Thank you.

01:08:08.207 --> 01:08:09.376
Thank you.

01:08:35.684 --> 01:08:37.381
We're on.

01:09:08.895 --> 01:09:10.254
Awesome!

01:09:10.854 --> 01:09:13.850
Emergency! Emergency!
Explosion in the West Wing!

01:09:39.299 --> 01:09:42.895
Where did we get this shitty car?
My ass hurts!

01:09:42.895 --> 01:09:44.654
<i>Control system is shut down.</i>

01:09:44.665 --> 01:09:46.403
Here we go!

01:09:48.662 --> 01:09:50.660
What the hell's going on?

01:09:57.554 --> 01:10:00.352
We've arrived in
East Wing Section 3.

01:10:03.649 --> 01:10:06.406
<i>Entering Section
11 container yard.</i>

01:10:07.046 --> 01:10:10.673

<i>Get rid of 3 million coupons

01:10:32.724 --> 01:10:35.680
How do we restore the system?

01:10:35.681 --> 01:10:38.618
We have to shut it
down and reset.

01:10:38.619 --> 01:10:41.646
Then we need permission
from the director...

01:10:42.835 --> 01:10:44.944
<i>I'm patching you to
the director now.</i>

01:10:45.044 --> 01:10:46.203
Answer, now.

01:10:46.213 --> 01:10:48.669
- Is that the only way?
- That's the best we can do, sir.

01:10:48.670 --> 01:10:50.709
Then shut it down.

01:11:11.491 --> 01:11:15.218
Control system is being reset!
All guards watch the gates.

01:11:16.417 --> 01:11:20.543
System is being reset.
We have 40-45 minutes.

01:11:21.383 --> 01:11:23.281
Finish in 40 minutes.

01:11:39.297 --> 01:11:42.694
Are you inspecting here too?
We never got orders.

01:11:56.313 --> 01:11:58.381
Take it easy.

01:12:43.443 --> 01:12:48.138
This safe is completely
daunting in real life!

01:12:48.139 --> 01:12:50.237
No time to babble.

01:12:53.534 --> 01:12:55.233
Begin.

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.458
You have 10 minutes, Ji Hyuk.

01:13:42.493 --> 01:13:45.389
Keep it at max! We have no time.

01:13:45.390 --> 01:13:48.117
This is the limit! If
it bursts, we all die!

01:13:48.118 --> 01:13:50.046
Raise it! We have no time!

01:13:50.056 --> 01:13:51.155
Damn it!

01:14:23.358 --> 01:14:30.222
<i>Explosion at Incheon Customs.

01:15:29.132 --> 01:15:30.401
Four minutes 40 seconds.

01:15:31.999 --> 01:15:35.267
Four minutes 45 seconds...
48 seconds...

01:15:37.095 --> 01:15:38.394
Five minutes 10 seconds.

01:15:42.161 --> 01:15:46.187
Five minutes 30 seconds! Hurry
and find the combination.

01:15:57.048 --> 01:16:00.625
We should've never done this.

01:16:01.244 --> 01:16:04.272
This is our last chance.

01:17:11.684 --> 01:17:14.792
I knew you'd do it, Lee.

01:17:17.140 --> 01:17:20.836
<i>This is the real thing.
We have 23 minutes left.</i>

01:17:20.837 --> 01:17:25.133
<i>Get the money in the car, now!</i>

01:17:59.973 --> 01:18:03.869
Keep focused! They're in
the East Wing for sure!

01:18:03.870 --> 01:18:06.238
<i>Search thoroughly

01:18:08.336 --> 01:18:09.894
<i>Yes, sir!</i>

01:18:09.895 --> 01:18:12.103
The damn cops!

01:18:29.019 --> 01:18:30.218
Take the money!

01:18:50.131 --> 01:18:51.530
<i>[00:07:00 TO SYSTEM REBOOT]</i>

01:19:11.183 --> 01:19:13.111
Why is it so quiet here?

01:19:16.179 --> 01:19:17.637
<i>Cops are here.</i>

01:19:20.775 --> 01:19:25.061
We have to see inside to
investigate the explosion.

01:19:25.071 --> 01:19:27.729
Outsiders are strictly
prohibited in secured areas.

01:19:28.468 --> 01:19:29.726
We're on public duty.

01:19:29.727 --> 01:19:32.194
<i>Don't make him suspicious!
Open it!</i>

01:19:32.195 --> 01:19:33.195
Yes, sir.

<i>System will reboot

01:20:06.436 --> 01:20:08.294
<i>Get out now!</i>

01:20:10.592 --> 01:20:13.490
I think it's a bonded warehouse.
Let's go.

01:20:19.655 --> 01:20:20.655
They're gone.

01:20:45.133 --> 01:20:48.200
Check each section
and report to me.

01:20:54.755 --> 01:20:58.121
It's all empty.
Everyone's evacuated.

01:20:58.122 --> 01:21:01.319
I know they're in here.
Drive around.

01:21:09.013 --> 01:21:12.010
<i>Entering the incineration

01:21:28.196 --> 01:21:29.324

- You go ahead.
- What?

01:21:30.994 --> 01:21:34.021
I'll distract them. We're finished
if they search the vehicle.

01:21:34.990 --> 01:21:35.720
Be careful.

01:21:35.721 --> 01:21:37.688

01:22:14.427 --> 01:22:17.324
Where's Lee Ji Hyuk?

01:22:22.580 --> 01:22:27.915
How dare you? You're
finished, Lee!

01:23:13.507 --> 01:23:15.385
Stop right there.

01:23:22.599 --> 01:23:26.226
This isn't how you
do business, Lee.

01:23:29.893 --> 01:23:34.358
Sorry I screwed up your plan.

01:23:34.359 --> 01:23:39.085
Nice work bringing in the
cops to buy you time.

01:23:39.884 --> 01:23:43.080
Why would a smart guy like you
do something so meaningless?

01:23:43.081 --> 01:23:45.608
Because I knew you wouldn't
keep your promise.

01:23:45.609 --> 01:23:47.508
Be honest.

01:23:48.407 --> 01:23:52.073
You're the one who
started all this.

01:23:52.074 --> 01:23:53.402
This is because of Mr.
Oh, right?

01:23:53.403 --> 01:23:59.437
You answer me first.

01:24:00.367 --> 01:24:08.360
Why did you kill Mr. Oh?

01:24:22.518 --> 01:24:28.412
How are you doing?

01:24:28.413 --> 01:24:36.035
I've known you for decades and I've
never seen your dear daughter.

01:24:36.036 --> 01:24:38.894
What are you saying?
Stay away from her.

01:24:38.904 --> 01:24:43.229
Aren't you sick of hiding?

01:24:43.230 --> 01:24:45.199
Don't you want to
see your daughter?

01:24:57.518 --> 01:25:00.975
<i>I asked him to do one last job.</i>

01:25:00.985 --> 01:25:05.172
But the old fool
stubbornly refused!

01:25:05.182 --> 01:25:08.978
He wouldn't have died if
he had just said yes.

01:25:13.105 --> 01:25:16.371
He probably knew there is no
last job for thieves like you.

01:25:16.372 --> 01:25:21.797
You're a sharp man, son.

01:25:23.026 --> 01:25:24.925

This is what you're going to do.

01:25:49.404 --> 01:25:52.400
Take this suitcase and go
to the explosion site.

01:25:52.401 --> 01:25:56.338
You're going to throw
me to the cops?

01:25:58.266 --> 01:26:00.733
What if I get caught and
tell them everything?

01:26:00.734 --> 01:26:03.462

<i>The suspect fell in the water.</i>

01:29:19.625 --> 01:29:23.342

Goodbye, Lee Ji Hyuk.

01:29:34.083 --> 01:29:36.780
- Get the coast guards on boat!
- Yes, sir!

01:29:41.806 --> 01:29:44.374
- Are you okay?
- Yes, sir.

01:29:51.098 --> 01:29:54.265
<i>Lee's been shot

01:29:54.266 --> 01:29:58.032
<i>It's sad but don't be distracted.

01:30:01.260 --> 01:30:05.316
I knew the cocky bastard
would end up like this.

01:30:05.326 --> 01:30:10.482
This means more money
to ourselves, Bro.

01:30:12.680 --> 01:30:16.347
You asshole! What did you say?

01:30:17.046 --> 01:30:18.375
Let go!

01:30:20.343 --> 01:30:24.170
Let go, damn it!

01:30:25.069 --> 01:30:26.138
You asshole!

01:30:27.637 --> 01:30:30.705
Say it again, you traitor!

01:30:53.185 --> 01:30:55.044
What are you doing?

01:30:55.513 --> 01:30:57.382
Asshole...

01:31:21.361 --> 01:31:25.417
We're at Incheon Customs where
two bombs exploded yesterday.

01:31:25.418 --> 01:31:28.215
The body of the terrorist
has not been found yet

01:31:28.216 --> 01:31:31.282
and the police are continuing
the investigation.

01:31:31.283 --> 01:31:34.379
An area has been
blocked off until now

01:31:34.380 --> 01:31:37.588
but Incheon Port Customs maintains
their regular operations.

01:32:00.858 --> 01:32:05.053
I told you I would rob
those politicians.

01:32:05.054 --> 01:32:06.853
Congratulations, sir.

01:32:39.994 --> 01:32:41.593
What's all this?

01:32:43.691 --> 01:32:46.019
What the hell happened?

01:33:02.505 --> 01:33:03.634
Yeah?

01:33:04.574 --> 01:33:08.570
You don't sound good. Guess
you got your coupons.

01:33:09.100 --> 01:33:12.367
How dare you, Lee!

01:33:12.767 --> 01:33:14.755
<i>Where is it?</i>

01:33:14.765 --> 01:33:17.652
What? Me or the money?

01:33:17.662 --> 01:33:21.858
I'm gonna ask you nicely.
Bring me that money.

01:33:21.859 --> 01:33:25.715
<i>If you bring it now,
I'll keep my word.</i>

01:33:25.716 --> 01:33:27.983
Yeah, right!

01:33:27.984 --> 01:33:30.811
You shouldn't be so cocky.

01:33:32.110 --> 01:33:33.378
I have the girl.

01:33:33.379 --> 01:33:38.474
Do whatever you want with her.
She means nothing to me.

01:33:38.475 --> 01:33:42.431
You don't think I'll find you?

01:33:42.441 --> 01:33:43.970
Don't you know who I am?

01:33:47.067 --> 01:33:50.724
I don't care who you are.

01:33:50.734 --> 01:33:52.991
Never been interested.

01:33:52.992 --> 01:33:56.559
Get ready for your company.

01:34:08.819 --> 01:34:10.777
Get them!

01:34:48.615 --> 01:34:50.943
It's over, Cho!

01:34:51.842 --> 01:34:54.439
- Get out.
- Sir, I um...

01:34:54.440 --> 01:34:55.778
I said out!

01:34:55.779 --> 01:34:59.536
I have a report about Cho.

01:35:06.630 --> 01:35:12.794

01:35:26.613 --> 01:35:27.652

01:35:34.376 --> 01:35:35.635
You asshole!

01:35:35.645 --> 01:35:37.643
Find Lee Joo Hwan!

01:35:39.602 --> 01:35:40.841
Follow me, sir.

01:35:53.929 --> 01:35:59.983
Lee told the cops? Asshole!

01:35:59.984 --> 01:36:03.450
I'll contact Mr. Yoon.
Stake out with him, sir.

01:36:03.451 --> 01:36:04.919
I'll take the girl
and follow you.

01:36:04.920 --> 01:36:07.878
We don't need the girl.
Get rid of her.

01:36:18.738 --> 01:36:19.837
You piece of shit!

01:37:27.250 --> 01:37:28.809
Stay still!

01:37:30.647 --> 01:37:32.246
Be quiet!

01:37:35.273 --> 01:37:38.331
Who are you? What do you want?

01:37:38.341 --> 01:37:40.239
So damn tight!

01:37:44.266 --> 01:37:45.394
Hurry, let's go!

01:37:45.395 --> 01:37:49.660
Who are you?

01:37:49.661 --> 01:37:51.489
You going or not?

01:37:53.558 --> 01:37:58.423
Ji Hyuk wants you
to just trust him.

01:38:25.261 --> 01:38:29.227
Hey Lee Joo Hwan! Freeze!

01:38:37.690 --> 01:38:40.747
Hold still, asshole!

01:39:00.830 --> 01:39:02.169
Shit!

01:39:05.466 --> 01:39:09.092
It's me. Cho just left.

01:39:09.093 --> 01:39:10.121
Thanks.

01:39:10.122 --> 01:39:12.590
Take care of Eun Ha.

01:39:19.255 --> 01:39:20.813
Well done!

01:39:21.413 --> 01:39:23.311
Let me ask you...

01:39:23.651 --> 01:39:25.109
How'd you do it?

01:39:25.110 --> 01:39:29.575
You can't do business if
you're dumb, Chairman Cho.

01:39:29.576 --> 01:39:32.542
What's easier?

01:39:32.543 --> 01:39:37.669
Turning something real into fake or
turning something fake into real?

01:39:38.638 --> 01:39:40.666
Chairman Cho from Chinatown.

01:39:43.264 --> 01:39:45.063
Put it down!

01:39:58.281 --> 01:40:01.248
We need someone outside
of Cho's radar.

01:40:01.249 --> 01:40:04.676
I'd do anything
to help you guys.

01:40:08.313 --> 01:40:09.542
What?

01:40:10.571 --> 01:40:12.709
I'm not doing it for the money.

01:40:47.709 --> 01:40:52.474
It doesn't stick, and it erases.
You call that ink?

01:40:52.475 --> 01:40:57.400
- Did it work this time?
- It's weak to alcohol.

01:40:57.401 --> 01:40:59.999
That could be an advantage.

01:41:04.565 --> 01:41:09.120
I'll give you a printer. Print
$50 million in 30 minutes.

01:41:09.121 --> 01:41:12.488
- I thought it doesn't print anything.
- The ink shows later.

01:41:14.357 --> 01:41:19.053
It appears slowly as the
ink oxidizes with the air.

01:41:38.666 --> 01:41:40.164
These are just coupons.

01:41:40.165 --> 01:41:43.691
Don't touch evidence
with your filthy hands!

01:41:43.692 --> 01:41:46.360
- Don't you even watch CSI?
- Get down.

01:41:49.087 --> 01:41:51.355
You look like a traitor.

01:41:52.424 --> 01:41:55.302
Enough of this shit! I'm out!

01:41:55.582 --> 01:41:57.950
Let go, damn it!

01:41:58.919 --> 01:42:01.276
I need you to do
some acting for me.

01:42:01.277 --> 01:42:05.043
- What acting?
- Pretend you're a real traitor.

01:42:05.044 --> 01:42:11.039
From now on, fool
both me and yourself.

01:42:11.438 --> 01:42:13.906
- Hurry!
- Almost done.

01:42:17.933 --> 01:42:23.058
I know you were going to
backstab your buddies with this.

01:43:04.963 --> 01:43:09.019
Are you sleeping, Koo In?

01:43:10.188 --> 01:43:11.617
Hey!

01:43:13.156 --> 01:43:14.584
He's coming!

01:43:17.482 --> 01:43:18.951
He's alive!

01:43:21.079 --> 01:43:22.897
You jerk!

01:43:23.077 --> 01:43:25.204
You should've told
me about your plan!

01:43:25.205 --> 01:43:30.160
You're so real when you get scared.
I had to fool you to fool Cho.

01:43:30.161 --> 01:43:31.910
You scared the shit out of me!

01:43:42.960 --> 01:43:46.188
How dare you play me?

01:44:31.089 --> 01:44:32.288
Get out.

01:44:45.177 --> 01:44:47.306
You have something
for me, right?

01:44:59.295 --> 01:45:01.993
Don't be so lame about this.

01:45:02.992 --> 01:45:08.886
You lost. Just accept it!

01:45:08.887 --> 01:45:14.412
It's not your style to
play with guns, Lee.

01:45:16.151 --> 01:45:18.509
Style can change.

01:45:19.708 --> 01:45:23.475
If I let you live, you'll
keep on annoying me.

01:45:27.841 --> 01:45:29.500
So goodbye.

01:45:30.369 --> 01:45:31.997
Chairman Cho.

01:45:35.964 --> 01:45:36.964
Bang!

01:45:39.661 --> 01:45:43.528
I'm not like you,
so I'll stop here.

01:45:44.227 --> 01:45:49.453
You tell the cops where the money
is, then you're really dead.

01:45:58.245 --> 01:46:01.812
Bro! It's raining!
Get in the car!

01:46:04.410 --> 01:46:05.538
I'm off.

01:46:05.539 --> 01:46:09.236
What's with the rain? It
wasn't in the forecast.

01:46:09.805 --> 01:46:13.402
- Took you long enough!
- The traffic was bad.

01:46:26.551 --> 01:46:28.718
Cho!

01:46:28.719 --> 01:46:30.717
It's over!

01:46:30.718 --> 01:46:32.746
Put your hands up, asshole!

01:46:38.581 --> 01:46:39.810
Wait!

01:46:44.276 --> 01:46:45.535
Good for you.

01:46:49.831 --> 01:46:54.767
I thought you had connections.
Why aren't they calling?

01:46:57.365 --> 01:47:01.661
You're in for the
long haul, Cho.

01:47:14.510 --> 01:47:15.749
Get ready!

01:47:17.178 --> 01:47:18.477
Shoot!

01:47:30.237 --> 01:47:33.394
It's changing!

01:48:20.394 --> 01:48:23.372
<i>[THIS IS THE INVESTMENT AS PROMISED.
SORRY IT'S LATE.]</i>

01:51:18.103 --> 01:51:20.441
I think I made you
too beautiful.

01:51:29.963 --> 01:51:31.631
How have you been?

01:51:33.590 --> 01:51:34.959
Good.

01:52:03.464 --> 01:52:06.061
- Your restaurant is so nice!
- Thank you.

01:52:06.062 --> 01:52:08.559
And you have a lot of guests.

01:52:08.560 --> 01:52:11.797
- Can I try your food?
- Sure.

01:52:13.426 --> 01:52:15.723
Tomato Spaghetti is the
specialty of this restaurant...

01:52:15.724 --> 01:52:17.821
What the hell?

01:52:17.822 --> 01:52:19.651
Chef!

01:52:21.749 --> 01:52:22.749
Yeah?

01:52:23.417 --> 01:52:27.413
I told you to boil and
peel the tomatoes!

01:52:27.414 --> 01:52:29.112
The peel doesn't taste good!

01:52:29.113 --> 01:52:31.140
That's nonsense, Boss.

01:52:31.141 --> 01:52:35.706
I told you the peel has
all the nutrients.

01:52:35.707 --> 01:52:39.133
What? You don't know anything!

01:52:39.134 --> 01:52:41.662
Do you even know when the
tomato came into Korea?

01:52:41.672 --> 01:52:43.760
During the reign
of King Gwanghae.

01:52:43.770 --> 01:52:48.896
I told you tomato peels are good
for you because they have...

01:52:50.664 --> 01:52:52.453
- Lycopene?
- Right.

01:52:52.463 --> 01:52:54.690
The peel has lycopene in it!

01:52:54.691 --> 01:52:57.987
No way! You still
should peel them!

01:52:57.988 --> 01:53:00.884
- Bring me the plates!
- Don't listen to him.

01:53:00.885 --> 01:53:03.482
- Get me the plates!
- Don't!

01:53:03.483 --> 01:53:08.749
- What's with you today?
- I want to be on TV too.

01:53:14.104 --> 01:53:17.470
Ta-da!

01:53:17.471 --> 01:53:21.628
As you saw on your way here,
we're surrounded by highways.

01:53:21.638 --> 01:53:26.693
You can drop a bomb or two
and no one would know!

01:53:26.694 --> 01:53:30.959
But the rent is too expensive!

01:53:30.960 --> 01:53:37.614
Special discount for you,
because we're buddies.

01:53:37.624 --> 01:53:38.483
Good.

01:53:38.484 --> 01:53:43.409
You know how much the
previous tenants made here?

01:53:43.419 --> 01:53:47.815
100 million dollars!

01:53:47.816 --> 01:53:52.971
I'm giving you this space
because we're like brothers.

01:53:56.638 --> 01:53:59.964
But in the documents...

01:53:59.965 --> 01:54:01.064
Wait!

01:54:04.931 --> 01:54:10.656
Do you know Lee Ji Hyuk?

01:54:22.886 --> 01:54:24.275
You can't go in.

01:54:24.285 --> 01:54:26.012
- Why?
- What?

01:54:26.013 --> 01:54:28.410
What's the problem?

01:54:28.411 --> 01:54:31.339
We're wearing brand
name clothes!

01:54:31.978 --> 01:54:33.506
You tell them.

01:54:33.507 --> 01:54:39.730
We went shopping to go clubbing
and we're even wearing make-up.

01:54:39.731 --> 01:54:41.329
What's the problem?

01:54:41.330 --> 01:54:42.399
Yo!
