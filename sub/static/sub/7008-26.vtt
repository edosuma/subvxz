Home Improvement.

00:08.508 --> 00:11.376
That's not very ladylike!

00:15.549 --> 00:17.711
Somebody call security!

00:18.985 --> 00:24.151
If you're gonna turn this show into
a three-ring circus, I might just quit.

00:24.224 --> 00:26.056
Sorry to lose you.

00:26.126 --> 00:28.061
You were a good man.

00:30.497 --> 00:33.433
Honey, a very prestigious
colleague of Dr. Hanover's

00:33.500 --> 00:35.799
has offered me a job at
his family clinic in Bloomington.

00:35.869 --> 00:38.600
Must be a pretty screwed up family
if they have their own clinic.

00:41.208 --> 00:45.543
This is really an incredible opportunity
for me. This man is amazing.

00:45.612 --> 00:48.377
You're serious about
moving to Indiana?

00:48.482 --> 00:50.348
Don't forget my car's in the shop.

00:50.417 --> 00:52.909
So, I'm gonna take your car
and drop you guys off at school.

00:52.986 --> 00:56.286
Wait? What makes you think
you can just take my car, just like that?

00:56.623 --> 00:58.990
Because I paid for half of it
"just like that."

01:01.294 --> 01:03.263
- Looks like we're gonna do this.
- Yeah.

01:03.363 --> 01:04.797
Move to Indiana.

01:04.864 --> 01:07.994
Yeah. You having second thoughts
at all?

01:08.368 --> 01:10.337
No. You?

01:11.338 --> 01:13.307
No. No.

01:15.375 --> 01:17.105
I guess I'll feel better, you know,

01:17.177 --> 01:20.477
when I make this call to Dr. Lee,
tell him I've decided to come.

01:21.781 --> 01:23.750
Yeah. I think you will.

01:24.851 --> 01:29.221
So, have a great <i>Tool Time</i>
grand finale.

01:31.358 --> 01:33.486
You guys okay
with this move to Indiana?

01:33.560 --> 01:36.530
- Yeah. I think so.
- Well, I'm totally depressed.

01:36.596 --> 01:38.690
This move's gonna be hard on all of us.
It really will.

01:38.765 --> 01:40.131
Not about the move, Dad.

01:40.233 --> 01:43.670
I'm a little depressed my "daddy" is
driving me to school in my car.

01:44.905 --> 01:48.273
We're talking about family.
It's way more important than any car.

01:49.609 --> 01:54.377
Well, it's just as important as a car.
More important than some cars.

01:54.481 --> 01:56.450
Dad, check the gauge!
We're out of gas!

01:56.516 --> 01:57.984
Don't worry about it.
We've got plenty of gas

01:58.051 --> 02:00.213
to get you guys to school
and me to <i>Tool Time.</i>

02:00.287 --> 02:02.222
Dad, we're on "empty."

02:02.289 --> 02:03.848
It's a fuel gauge.

02:03.924 --> 02:07.292
"Empty" doesn't mean empty.
It's just a guide. Don't you know that?

02:07.394 --> 02:10.660
We got 10 miles left.

02:10.729 --> 02:13.427
And it's only 5.3 to get you to school...

02:13.500 --> 02:15.594
Another 2.6 to <i>Tool Time...</i>

02:15.669 --> 02:18.298
You add those together, you...

02:24.044 --> 02:26.013
Well, you add them together,
you know, and...

02:26.079 --> 02:29.607
I don't know what it is,
but I know it's less than 10.

02:34.854 --> 02:38.814
Well, that 10 miles went by
rather fast, huh?

You know, it just seems like yesterday
you guys used to sit in my lap

03:30.343 --> 03:32.403
and hold the wheel while I drove.

03:32.479 --> 03:35.415
Hey, don't get any ideas.

03:37.684 --> 03:40.518
You know, that's gonna be the
hardest part about moving.

03:41.254 --> 03:42.517
So many memories here.

03:42.589 --> 03:44.490
This is where you guys grew up.

03:45.825 --> 03:48.590
- Group hug.
- Oh, man!

03:49.696 --> 03:53.258
- Dad, we're too old for this.
- You're too old for a group hug?

03:54.034 --> 03:57.061
It's back to individual ones, then.

03:58.471 --> 04:02.567
<i>Bad, bad, bad, bad boy</i>

04:02.642 --> 04:05.373
<i>You make me feel so good</i>

04:07.947 --> 04:09.279
- Mom!
- What?

04:09.349 --> 04:10.715
- Dad's cussing.
- I'm not cussing.

04:10.817 --> 04:12.183
- He said a bad word.
- It wasn't bad.

04:12.285 --> 04:14.049
Yeah, he said "hell" and "damn."

04:14.154 --> 04:17.851
- I did not say "damn."
- Now you did.

04:18.925 --> 04:20.791
Hey, Dad, I heard a good joke today.

04:20.860 --> 04:23.352
- What was it?
- Okay.

04:23.430 --> 04:26.195
What did the moron
have for breakfast?

04:26.299 --> 04:27.460
I don't know.

04:27.567 --> 04:31.436
This morning you had
scrambled eggs and toast!

04:31.738 --> 04:35.368
<i>Bad, bad, bad, bad boy</i>

04:35.442 --> 04:38.412
<i>You make me feel so good</i>

04:38.511 --> 04:39.570
It's not that big a deal.

04:39.646 --> 04:43.811
- I mean, I've had detention before.
- It's the first day of school!

04:45.452 --> 04:48.820
No one ever gets detention
on the first day of school.

04:48.888 --> 04:51.756
I wouldn't say no one.

04:52.559 --> 04:54.323
No, it's gonna take a minute to boot up.

04:54.394 --> 04:58.559
I still have that old 286 chip on it.
Not much power.

05:03.269 --> 05:05.500
Are you saying this thing
needs more power?

05:06.606 --> 05:09.940
Lemme open it up.
I can make this thing go faster.

05:10.977 --> 05:12.275
Well, why don't we just
save you the trouble

05:12.345 --> 05:14.439
and throw it up against the wall?

05:14.981 --> 05:16.005
Oh, man!

05:16.082 --> 05:19.917
<i>Bad, bad, bad, bad boy</i>

05:19.986 --> 05:23.013
<i>You make me feel so good</i>

05:23.089 --> 05:25.354
Oh, so now you're telling me
what I can and can't write?

05:25.425 --> 05:28.395
You're acting like
some tyrannical fascist.

05:29.729 --> 05:32.426
Did he just call me a dinosaur?

05:32.799 --> 05:36.327
Sex is... It's like a car.

05:36.403 --> 05:38.235
The best idea

05:38.304 --> 05:42.639
is to keep the car in the garage
for a long, long, long time.

05:45.145 --> 05:48.240
And then, somewhere in the future,
the distant future,

05:48.314 --> 05:53.378
when that garage door opens,
you gotta think, "Car cover."

05:55.155 --> 05:57.249
Guys, will you clean up
this pigsty, now?

05:57.323 --> 05:59.849
Yeah. We'll get right on it.

06:03.696 --> 06:05.961
Ah, look at this picture of the kids.
This is what?

06:06.032 --> 06:09.491
The summer of 1991. Aren't they cute?

06:12.238 --> 06:14.764
- Hey.
- Hey.

06:26.820 --> 06:30.757
Hey, Brad. I'll take that change
from the gas money now.

06:30.824 --> 06:32.258
Oh, yeah.

06:36.629 --> 06:39.599
Maybe next time you'll fill up the tank
like I asked you to.

06:39.666 --> 06:41.100
Hope you learned something from this.

06:41.167 --> 06:44.535
Yeah, that the "E" stands for "empty,"
not "extra 10 miles."

06:45.205 --> 06:48.539
I'll tell you one thing. If I had built this
car, it'd have an extra fuel tank in it.

06:48.608 --> 06:51.168
Dad, if you built this car,
we'd be taking the bus.

06:53.079 --> 06:57.039
Hey, if there's one thing Dad knows
how to do, it's build a car, okay?

06:57.383 --> 07:00.148
This is the greatest gift
you've ever given me.

07:00.253 --> 07:02.518
I gave you three children.

07:02.589 --> 07:05.423
Yeah. But none of them
came out this clean.

07:07.026 --> 07:10.554
<i>Oh, switchblade 327</i>
<i>Lit cigarette in his hand</i>

07:10.630 --> 07:14.123
<i>Steel-toed boots on the accelerator</i>
<i>Oil leaking out of the pan</i>

07:17.570 --> 07:21.530
<i>Switchblade, three two-barrels</i>
<i>Getting there as fast as you can</i>

07:21.641 --> 07:25.703
<i>All juiced up like a hot carburetor</i>
<i>Spitting gas on the fan</i>

07:25.778 --> 07:28.338
All right, under the car. Man territory.

07:28.448 --> 07:32.476
<i>Switchblade! 327</i>
<i>Switchblade! Seven come 11</i>

07:32.552 --> 07:34.919
<i>Switchblade!Oh, he's all right</i>

07:34.988 --> 07:38.015
- I'm addicted to cars.
- Well, duh!

07:38.091 --> 07:41.528
I'm thinking of checking into
the Henry Ford Clinic.

08:00.380 --> 08:02.542
Dad, can we stop? I'm really hungry.

08:02.615 --> 08:05.380
How can you be hungry?
Your mom just cooked us breakfast.

08:06.019 --> 08:08.386
Did you eat it?

08:08.454 --> 08:10.423
It was good oatmeal.

08:10.523 --> 08:12.890
It was scrambled eggs.

08:13.726 --> 08:15.456
Bad scrambled eggs.

08:16.095 --> 08:17.791
Yeah. When I get married,

08:17.864 --> 08:21.028
I'm gonna make a woman prove to me
that she's a good cook.

08:21.134 --> 08:24.627
That's why you're gonna be 80,
alone and very hungry.

08:26.472 --> 08:28.703
Come on! Cooking has nothing
to do with a relationship.

08:28.775 --> 08:30.505
Your mom and I have a good marriage

08:30.577 --> 08:33.842
because we share
an honest, mutual respect.

08:33.913 --> 08:35.745
How could you say that?

08:36.349 --> 08:38.181
Why do you always bug me
during the football game?

08:38.251 --> 08:40.220
Did I bug you during childbirth?

08:41.688 --> 08:44.351
No. But you bugged me
during conception.

08:44.991 --> 08:46.687
Little gas ball. Moving... Moving.

08:51.698 --> 08:53.462
This is real attractive.

08:55.068 --> 08:56.627
I just read this survey,

08:56.736 --> 08:59.604
and it said that some couples,
no matter how busy they are,

08:59.672 --> 09:02.767
still make love five times a week.

09:02.842 --> 09:04.811
With each other?

09:06.913 --> 09:09.280
Where were we?

09:12.585 --> 09:14.747
It's kind of hard to remember.

09:15.955 --> 09:18.083
This will refresh your memory.

09:27.166 --> 09:28.532
- Can't we just... Can't we just...
- No, no...

09:28.635 --> 09:30.103
- One time. Just think, think, think.
- No... No... No...

09:30.169 --> 09:32.331
- But... Home-automated system!
- No! No!

09:32.605 --> 09:35.165
We never actually said that we
weren't gonna have another baby.

09:35.275 --> 09:38.040
I've said it. I've talked about it.
I know I've talked about it.

09:38.144 --> 09:39.669
I mentioned it on <i>Tool Time.</i>

09:39.746 --> 09:42.011
Oh, great. So 11 people know about it?

09:44.317 --> 09:48.277
Do you remember babies at all?
Dirty diapers. Colic.

09:48.354 --> 09:50.414
2:00 a.m. feedings!
3:00 a.m. feedings!

09:50.490 --> 09:52.789
I don't have the energy
for that anymore.

09:52.859 --> 09:56.591
You don't have the energy to say,
"Wake up, Jill, the baby wants you"?

09:58.531 --> 10:00.693
Sorry. I'm sorry! Mark was right.

10:02.135 --> 10:05.594
You shouldn't have double onions
on those chili dogs.

10:06.806 --> 10:08.570
Hello.

10:17.216 --> 10:19.515
Your mom and I have
had our share of disagreements,

10:19.585 --> 10:21.645
but in the end,
it doesn't matter, you know?

10:21.721 --> 10:24.816
Because one of us always apologizes.

10:24.891 --> 10:27.053
- You?
- Yup.

10:27.126 --> 10:29.493
It was a good thing that you
had Wilson here to help you out.

10:29.595 --> 10:33.555
Well, he's learned as much from me
as I have from him.

10:33.666 --> 10:37.535
Tim, would you mind listening
while I ruminate?

10:37.603 --> 10:41.472
No, go ahead.
Use the bush over by the gazebo.

10:42.909 --> 10:45.435
There was a time when I thought
my extensive research

10:45.511 --> 10:48.481
into ancient tribal cultures,
obscure scientific data,

10:48.548 --> 10:51.712
the thoughts of great philosophers
would never come in handy.

10:51.784 --> 10:54.253
Then you moved in.

10:55.121 --> 10:58.489
I like to create, Wilson. Everything I do
I want to make bigger and better.

10:58.591 --> 11:03.620
Well, Tim, this obsessive
desire to create partly happens

11:03.696 --> 11:06.393
because men feel inferior to women.

11:09.202 --> 11:11.364
It's because we can't bear children.

11:11.437 --> 11:13.463
I don't mind the boys that much.

11:18.878 --> 11:21.507
Wilson, you're not making me
feel any better.

11:21.581 --> 11:26.542
Well, excuse me! Why do I always
have to be Santa's little helper?

11:26.619 --> 11:29.851
- Well...
- I mean, I have wants. I have needs.

11:29.922 --> 11:32.653
I have issues. But does anyone ever
come to the fence and say,

11:32.725 --> 11:34.660
"Wilson, do you have a problem?"
I mean, no!

11:34.727 --> 11:36.958
It's just "Me, me, me, me!"

11:38.431 --> 11:41.663
You know, Tim, I'm reminded
of an old philosopher who once said,

11:41.734 --> 11:44.568
"You have to give a little, take a little..."

11:44.637 --> 11:47.573
"Let your poor heart break a little."

11:49.842 --> 11:51.367
<i>- That's the story of</i>
<i>- That's the story of</i>

11:51.444 --> 11:53.936
<i>- That's the glory of love</i>
<i>- That's the glory of love</i>

11:56.382 --> 11:58.317
Hey, there.

11:58.384 --> 12:00.615
I get recognized everywhere.

12:00.686 --> 12:03.781
Dad, he was honking
because you took up two lanes.

12:05.625 --> 12:08.254
He was thrilled to see me.
That's why he was waving his hand.

12:08.327 --> 12:10.296
Dad, that was only part of his hand.

12:12.398 --> 12:15.334
He was saying,
<i>"Tool Time</i> is number one."

12:16.803 --> 12:18.499
Does everybody know what time it is?

12:18.571 --> 12:20.540
<i>- Tool Time!</i>
<i>- Tool Time!</i>

12:21.607 --> 12:24.668
Hi. Tim "The Tool Man" Taylor.
And you all know my assistant,

12:24.744 --> 12:27.714
Al "This Land is" Borland.

13:09.122 --> 13:11.148
Oh, my God!

13:11.224 --> 13:13.193
What is this thing on your head?

13:14.093 --> 13:16.153
It's a little piece of table.

13:18.464 --> 13:19.727
What happened?

13:19.799 --> 13:23.861
Mr. Negativity Al distracted me, and
I got my head cemented to this table.

13:23.936 --> 13:27.031
They had to take a saber saw to get me
off of that table.

13:27.106 --> 13:28.972
Don't you think you should go
to the emergency room?

13:29.041 --> 13:31.977
I was just there.
They said I wasn't a priority.

13:33.546 --> 13:37.005
Why? Was there a guy
with a whole table stuck to his head?

13:38.618 --> 13:39.711
What do we need?

13:39.785 --> 13:41.754
- More power!
- More power!

13:46.859 --> 13:47.827
Come on, guys!

13:49.562 --> 13:51.895
Jam it in the light.

13:57.536 --> 13:58.765
Stuff like this.

14:07.513 --> 14:09.243
Here you go, Tim.

14:38.144 --> 14:42.309
The one good thing about <i>Tool Time</i>
being over is no more accidents.

14:42.381 --> 14:44.247
We still have a house.

14:44.317 --> 14:46.218
You know what they say.

14:46.285 --> 14:49.255
Every year, over 100,000
accidents occur in the home.

14:49.322 --> 14:52.656
And 99,000 of those
occur in our home.

14:54.560 --> 14:57.086
All right, Dad. Let her rip.

14:57.163 --> 15:00.190
No, wait a minute. Wait a minute.
I think we should say a prayer first.

15:00.266 --> 15:02.565
Please, Lord.
Don't let our house blow up.

15:03.703 --> 15:05.262
<i>I get knocked down</i>
<i>But I get up again</i>

15:05.371 --> 15:07.272
<i>You're never gonna keep me down</i>

15:07.340 --> 15:09.866
<i>I get knocked down</i>
<i>But I get up again</i>

15:10.042 --> 15:11.806
<i>You're never gonna keep me down</i>

15:11.911 --> 15:14.403
<i>I get knocked down</i>
<i>But I get up again</i>

15:14.480 --> 15:16.449
<i>You're never gonna keep me down</i>

15:16.515 --> 15:19.041
<i>I get knocked down</i>
<i>But I get up again</i>

15:19.118 --> 15:21.553
<i>You're never gonna keep me down</i>

15:21.620 --> 15:24.385
Ground. We're looking to ground.
Yellow, see?

15:24.490 --> 15:28.723
The sun is yellow. It heats the ground.
That's how they name stuff.

15:33.599 --> 15:36.159
Is that car running?

15:42.575 --> 15:44.407
Oh, shake it off.

15:48.714 --> 15:51.377
<i>I get knocked down</i>
<i>But I get up again</i>

15:51.450 --> 15:53.009
<i>You're never gonna keep me down</i>

15:53.119 --> 15:55.679
<i>I get knocked down</i>
<i>But I get up again</i>

15:55.788 --> 15:57.882
<i>You're never gonna keep me down</i>

16:03.162 --> 16:06.428
It's okay. The ground seems
to have broken my fall.

16:06.766 --> 16:09.201
<i>Get knocked down</i>
<i>But I get up again</i>

16:09.502 --> 16:11.266
<i>You're never gonna keep me down</i>

16:11.337 --> 16:13.829
<i>I get knocked down</i>
<i>But I get up again</i>

16:14.040 --> 16:16.475
<i>You're never gonna keep me down</i>

16:16.776 --> 16:19.439
You know, Marge,
it's kind of gratifying

16:19.512 --> 16:22.778
to be here in the hospital
and not be a patient.

16:22.848 --> 16:25.613
- See you, "Tool Man."
- Hey, buddy.

16:28.287 --> 16:31.314
Well, maybe you can
have that feeling another day.

16:36.128 --> 16:38.427
- Hey, thanks for the ride, Dad.
- You bet.

16:38.497 --> 16:41.467
- Yeah. Go get 'em at <i>Tool Time.</i>
- Yeah. Break a leg, huh?

16:41.567 --> 16:44.196
- Oh, you know what I mean.
- Hey, guys?

16:44.270 --> 16:47.206
I probably don't say this enough
to you two, but I love you guys.

16:47.273 --> 16:49.435
I'm really happy the way you guys
turned out, you know?

16:49.508 --> 16:53.070
You're smart, hard-working,
honest boys.

16:56.082 --> 16:58.244
Here's the rest of that gas money.

16:59.351 --> 17:01.286
I knew you were holding out.

17:02.388 --> 17:04.880
- Get out of here.
- Later, Dad. Love you.

17:04.957 --> 17:06.289
- Have a good day, Dad.
- You, too.

17:06.358 --> 17:07.917
Love you.

17:07.992 --> 17:09.757
A lot of memories.

17:14.867 --> 17:18.031
I'm perfectly happy being married to
a man who thinks that

17:18.104 --> 17:21.438
PBS is something that
women get once a month.

17:24.242 --> 17:27.577
Honey, it is much safer for a man
to get a vasectomy

17:27.646 --> 17:30.206
than it is for a woman to have
a tubal ligation.

17:30.316 --> 17:32.979
Says who?
The Wives with Knives Club?

17:34.286 --> 17:37.552
A woman?
You brought me here to see a woman?

17:37.623 --> 17:40.320
I didn't know she was a woman.
My gynecologist just said that

17:40.393 --> 17:43.693
Dr. Kaplan was the best
urologist in town.

17:43.763 --> 17:48.133
How am I supposed to talk to a woman
about what's going on in man land?

17:48.968 --> 17:54.202
Man land? Now you got a theme park
between your legs?

17:55.274 --> 17:59.541
Demolition derby... Sexy wife...

17:59.612 --> 18:01.240
Could you hold that thought
until about 10:00 tonight?

18:01.313 --> 18:04.078
Wait a minute. This thought here?

18:09.255 --> 18:11.781
That... That would be the one.

18:12.992 --> 18:15.518
What causes sibling rivalry?

18:15.594 --> 18:17.859
Having more than one kid.

18:18.964 --> 18:21.126
You fired the granite guy?

18:24.036 --> 18:26.062
Did you hear what I said?
He came on to me.

18:26.138 --> 18:28.039
What did he say?
You had a nice outfit or something?

18:28.107 --> 18:29.598
He kissed me.

18:33.412 --> 18:35.972
- What did you do?
- I... I pushed him away!

18:36.048 --> 18:39.177
- Well, you should have fired him!
- I did fire him!

18:39.251 --> 18:41.482
You fired the granite guy?

18:43.188 --> 18:44.952
It's always been my fantasy
to be with a man

18:45.024 --> 18:47.118
who enjoyed doing
the same things I do.

18:47.193 --> 18:51.255
You know, like taking me
to the opera, the ballet, the theater.

18:51.330 --> 18:52.855
That's my fantasy too.

18:54.100 --> 18:55.466
- Really?
- Uh-huh.

18:55.568 --> 18:58.629
If I could find that man,
I wouldn't have to go myself.

19:00.439 --> 19:03.409
Our wedding was so beautiful.

19:03.776 --> 19:08.476
I am so glad that I didn't let anybody
talk me out of marrying you.

19:12.651 --> 19:14.677
Who tried to talk you
out of marrying me?

19:14.753 --> 19:17.313
Oh, no one. You know, just

19:17.423 --> 19:21.190
my mom, my dad,
my sisters, my friends,

19:21.260 --> 19:27.359
the minister, the postman,
some guys down at the mailbox.

19:33.839 --> 19:37.537
<i>It's hard to say goodbye</i>

19:37.643 --> 19:41.102
<i>You're much more than a friend</i>

19:41.180 --> 19:45.140
<i>When good times becomes memories</i>

19:45.251 --> 19:49.211
<i>They never really end</i>

19:49.321 --> 19:52.883
<i>Like ancient rites of passage</i>

19:52.992 --> 19:56.861
<i>It's time to carry on</i>

19:56.929 --> 20:01.299
<i>We caught lightening in a bottle</i>

20:01.367 --> 20:06.101
<i>As we went along</i>

20:06.172 --> 20:09.734
<i>We've got it all</i>

20:11.811 --> 20:14.042
<i>Wouldn't change a minute</i>

20:14.113 --> 20:17.481
<i>We've got it all</i>

20:18.417 --> 20:21.979
<i>Never will forget it</i>

20:22.054 --> 20:25.582
<i>As years go slipping by us</i>

20:25.658 --> 20:29.186
<i>You know we will recall</i>

20:29.261 --> 20:32.163
<i>These times we've found together</i>

20:32.231 --> 20:36.566
<i>We've got it all</i>

20:36.635 --> 20:43.633
<i>Long goodbyes never suited</i>
<i>you and me</i>

20:43.709 --> 20:46.838
<i>You know if God is willing</i>

20:46.912 --> 20:51.247
<i>We'll go on eternally</i>

20:53.152 --> 20:57.920
<i>We've got it all</i>

21:10.703 --> 21:13.832
I can't believe this is my last
<i>Tool Time.</i>

21:20.412 --> 21:24.076
Well, those 10 miles went by
rather fast, huh?

21:30.055 --> 21:34.516
I tell you to fill the car up, do as I say.
I hope you learned that.

21:34.593 --> 21:38.291
Yeah, I learned that the "E"...

21:38.831 --> 21:41.357
I'll tell you one thing.
Wilson's learned enough from me,

21:41.433 --> 21:44.767
you know, to fill a bushel basket
full of pears.
