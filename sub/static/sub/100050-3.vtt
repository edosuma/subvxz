00:01.000 --> 00:03.700
Previously on Young Sheldon...
Dr. Linkletter!

00:03.930 --> 00:05.430
Please meet my girlfriend,

00:05.630 --> 00:07.270
Connie Tucker.

00:07.270 --> 00:08.940
Connie, did you grow up
in Texas?

00:08.940 --> 00:11.510
Took my first bath
in a ten-gallon hat.
Oh, my goodness.

00:11.510 --> 00:13.410
You're as funny
as you are beautiful.

00:13.410 --> 00:15.180
LINKLETTER: If I didn't know
any better, I'd say

00:15.180 --> 00:17.850
you were sweet-talking
my date right in front of me.

00:17.850 --> 00:19.610
(rings)
Hello?

00:19.610 --> 00:21.020
Hi, Dr. Linkletter.

00:21.020 --> 00:22.450
It's Connie Tucker.
Connie.

00:22.450 --> 00:24.390
To what do I owe the pleasure?

00:24.390 --> 00:25.920
I need a favor.
Of course.

00:25.920 --> 00:27.120
Should we discuss it
over dinner?

00:27.120 --> 00:28.560
I'll take a rain check on that.

00:28.560 --> 00:29.890
I was hoping

00:29.890 --> 00:33.390
that my grandson could join
in your physics class

00:33.390 --> 00:36.530
until John is, uh... back.

00:36.530 --> 00:38.400
From the mental hospital?
Yes.

00:38.400 --> 00:40.300
The one he never told you
he'd been in before?

00:40.300 --> 00:42.170
Yes.
A curious ethical choice

00:42.170 --> 00:43.400
on his part, if you ask me.

00:43.400 --> 00:44.810
Can he take the class or not?

00:44.810 --> 00:46.010
Of course.

00:46.010 --> 00:47.680
I never taught a child before.

00:47.680 --> 00:49.140
Is he potty trained?

00:51.780 --> 00:54.650
ADULT SHELDON:
Teachers have always
been impressed by me.

00:54.650 --> 00:56.250
All righty, then...

00:56.250 --> 00:58.090
And my new college professor
was no exception.

00:58.090 --> 01:01.420
You'd think it was my
once-in-a-generation intellect.

01:01.420 --> 01:03.420
But it was more than that.
There was my

01:03.420 --> 01:05.290
wicked sense of humor...

01:05.290 --> 01:07.090
...explained by
maximizing entropy.

01:07.660 --> 01:09.000
Yes, Sheldon?

01:09.000 --> 01:11.230
Entropy.
It isn't what it used to be.

01:11.230 --> 01:13.300
ADULT SHELDON:
Plus, when things got heavy,

01:13.300 --> 01:17.100
I was always ready with
a fun fact to lighten the mood.

01:17.100 --> 01:19.470
Fun fact: Did you know
that the ancient Incas

01:19.470 --> 01:23.040
stored bureaucratic records on
knotted strings called "quipu"?

01:24.080 --> 01:26.250
Q-U-I-P-U. Quipu.

01:26.250 --> 01:29.820
ADULT SHELDON:
Whatever the reason, I was
clearly his favorite student.

01:29.820 --> 01:31.020
(whispering):
Ready to go?

01:31.020 --> 01:33.090
Connie...
What a treat it is

01:33.090 --> 01:34.390
to see you.

01:34.390 --> 01:35.590
ADULT SHELDON:
Look at him smile.

01:35.590 --> 01:37.020
He couldn't get enough of me.

01:37.020 --> 01:38.490
Uh, Sheldon,
if you're interested,

01:38.490 --> 01:40.460
an old friend of mine
is giving a lecture

01:40.460 --> 01:43.030
next week on the mathematics
of robotic communication.

01:43.030 --> 01:45.330
Really?
Yes. If your grandmother's

01:45.330 --> 01:47.540
willing to drive you,
maybe we can all go.

01:47.540 --> 01:49.670
Make a night of it.
Oh, we'll be there.

01:49.670 --> 01:52.770
Uh-uh-uh, wait, we-we don't
even know what night it is.
Thursday.

01:52.770 --> 01:55.410
Oh. Thursday might be
a problem for me.

01:55.410 --> 01:57.250
Thursday's perfect for you.
Wonderful.

01:57.250 --> 01:58.610
You don't know that.

01:58.610 --> 02:00.380
Yes, I do.
Mondays you have bowling,

02:00.380 --> 02:03.120
Tuesday's water aerobics,
Wednesday, salsa dancing,

02:03.120 --> 02:04.490
Fridays, you bring me here.

02:04.490 --> 02:06.490
Your Thursday was wide open,
but not anymore.

02:06.490 --> 02:08.420
We'll see you then.
(snaps fingers)
Excellent.

02:08.420 --> 02:09.920
Shall we plan on
dinner beforehand?

02:09.920 --> 02:11.130
Ooh...
Just,

02:11.130 --> 02:12.560
hold on.

02:12.560 --> 02:16.060
Can I speak to you
for a moment?

02:16.060 --> 02:17.730
The grown-ups need to talk.

02:17.730 --> 02:19.430
That wasn't
made clear.

02:19.430 --> 02:21.940
You're asking me out
in front of my grandson

02:21.940 --> 02:23.140
so I can't say no.

02:23.140 --> 02:24.440
You saw through that.

02:24.440 --> 02:25.940
You think you're pretty smart.

02:25.940 --> 02:29.680
Well, I do have two PhDs
and a date with you on Thursday.

02:30.780 --> 02:33.650
♪ Nobody else
is stronger than I am ♪

02:33.650 --> 02:35.980
♪ Yesterday I moved a mountain ♪

02:35.980 --> 02:39.650
♪ I bet I could be your hero ♪

02:39.650 --> 02:41.590
♪ I am a mighty little man ♪

02:41.590 --> 02:45.330
♪ I am a mighty little man. ♪

02:53.730 --> 02:56.900
Uh, you order something from
the Mountain View Candy Company?

02:56.900 --> 02:58.170
Oh, yeah. Thanks.

02:58.170 --> 02:59.670
(exhales)
The hell is it?

02:59.670 --> 03:02.240
A big old box of candy.

03:04.150 --> 03:05.550
What's all this about candy?

03:05.550 --> 03:07.880
(music playing over headphones)

03:07.880 --> 03:10.320
SHELDON:
That robotics lecture's
going to be

03:10.320 --> 03:13.120
eye-opening. Get ready
to forget everything you know

03:13.120 --> 03:14.960
about robot
communication.

03:14.960 --> 03:18.860
Moon Pie, I don't know if
we're gonna go to this thing.

03:18.860 --> 03:21.330
Why not? We've established
that you're free,

03:21.330 --> 03:23.900
and I'm a child,
so my schedule's wide open.

03:23.900 --> 03:25.100
It's complicated.

03:25.100 --> 03:26.400
Well, we're just sitting here,

03:26.400 --> 03:27.600
and we have to talk
about something.

03:27.600 --> 03:29.300
Can you just let this one go?

03:29.300 --> 03:31.910
I think we both know
the answer to that question.

03:31.910 --> 03:34.180
Fine.

03:34.180 --> 03:38.380
There are certain
grown-up dynamics

03:38.380 --> 03:39.580
taking place
here that you,

03:39.580 --> 03:41.850
you might
not be aware of.

03:41.850 --> 03:44.090
Well, I like quantum-
chromodynamics

03:44.090 --> 03:45.550
and thermodynamics;

03:45.550 --> 03:48.620
perhaps I'll like
grown-up dynamics. Tell me.

03:49.660 --> 03:52.490
I'm just saying
that Dr. Linkletter

03:52.490 --> 03:56.360
might be paying
special attention to you

03:56.360 --> 04:01.000
so he can become
better friends with me.

04:01.000 --> 04:02.500
Why?

04:02.500 --> 04:04.470
You're just gonna
have to trust me on this one.

04:04.470 --> 04:06.970
Are you saying he doesn't
really want me

04:06.970 --> 04:08.640
at this lecture?
No,

04:08.640 --> 04:11.850
I'm just saying he really
wants me at this lecture.

04:11.850 --> 04:13.310
But that's illogical.

04:13.310 --> 04:15.880
He knows you're in
a relationship with Dr. Sturgis.

04:15.880 --> 04:18.690
And now we're back to
it's complicated,

04:18.690 --> 04:20.050
so drop it.

04:20.050 --> 04:23.660
I'll try, but dropping things
is not where I shine.

04:29.730 --> 04:31.400
Hey? What you buying?

04:31.400 --> 04:33.230
M&Ms?
Cool.

04:33.230 --> 04:34.970
Peanut or plain?

04:35.170 --> 04:37.770
Am I in trouble?

04:37.770 --> 04:40.810
You are if you waste your money
on that machine.

04:40.810 --> 04:42.540
What?

04:42.540 --> 04:46.550
I'm selling the same stuff
for half the price.

04:46.550 --> 04:49.620
Cool. Oh, you got
Abba-Zabas?

04:49.620 --> 04:53.120
Do I have Abba-Zabas.

04:53.120 --> 04:54.960
Do you?

04:54.960 --> 04:56.560
Yeah.

04:57.760 --> 05:01.600
Tam, I need help navigating
a social situation.

05:01.600 --> 05:03.000
I'm eating lunch
with you.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.400
You think I
have the answer?

05:04.400 --> 05:05.930
Dr. Linkletter
invited me

05:05.930 --> 05:07.870
to a lecture on robotics,
but my meemaw said

05:07.870 --> 05:10.000
he's only doing it
to spend time with her.

05:10.000 --> 05:14.010
Are you asking if men do
sketchy things to get dates?
Yes.

05:14.010 --> 05:15.640
Well, then, I
can help you.

05:15.640 --> 05:18.650
Absolutely. Last week,
I told Jessica Geiger

05:18.650 --> 05:20.950
I was an extra in
Karate Kid Part II.

05:20.950 --> 05:22.150
Did it work?

05:22.150 --> 05:23.350
Again,

05:23.350 --> 05:25.150
I'm having lunch with you.

05:25.150 --> 05:27.120
(phone rings)

05:27.120 --> 05:29.160
Grant Linkletter.

05:29.160 --> 05:31.660
This is Sheldon Cooper.
I'm speaking quietly

05:31.660 --> 05:33.330
because I'm calling
from a library.

05:33.330 --> 05:36.160
(whispers):
Hello, Sheldon.
Nice to hear from you.

05:36.160 --> 05:38.800
Why are you whispering?
Are you in a library?

05:38.800 --> 05:40.670
(whispers):
Good point. (clears throat)

05:40.670 --> 05:42.170
(normal voice):
How can I help you?

05:42.170 --> 05:44.170
My meemaw doesn't want
to take me to the lecture

05:44.170 --> 05:45.710
because she thinks
that you're just using me

05:45.710 --> 05:47.110
to spend time with her.

05:47.110 --> 05:48.540
I see.

05:48.540 --> 05:50.440
Well, you're
an intelligent young man.

05:50.440 --> 05:51.780
What do you think?

05:51.780 --> 05:53.310
I think she's wrong,
and you invited me

05:53.310 --> 05:55.680
because you know I appreciate
the subject matter.

05:55.680 --> 05:57.480
Exactly right.

05:57.480 --> 05:59.250
You're even smarter
than I thought.

05:59.250 --> 06:00.520
I knew it.

06:00.520 --> 06:02.520
My meemaw couldn't be
more wrong.

06:02.520 --> 06:03.960
STUDENT:
Shh!

06:03.960 --> 06:06.490
Oh, like you were reading
a book anyway.

06:06.490 --> 06:08.200
You sure you're
only a freshman?

06:08.200 --> 06:11.800
'Cause you got the sophisticated
taste buds of a junior. Easy.

06:12.900 --> 06:14.640
Hey, Veronica.

06:14.640 --> 06:16.500
What was that about?

06:16.500 --> 06:18.070
Just conducting
a little business.

06:18.070 --> 06:20.540
Careful. When my sister
sold stuff at school,

06:20.540 --> 06:22.040
she ended up in juvie.

06:22.040 --> 06:23.080
Nothing like that.

06:23.080 --> 06:26.410
Just candy.
Very entrepreneurial.

06:26.410 --> 06:28.080
I'm impressed.

06:28.080 --> 06:31.290
(echoing):
Impressed...
impressed... impressed.

06:31.290 --> 06:35.020
♪ Pour some sugar on me ♪

06:35.020 --> 06:37.420
♪ Ooh, in the name of love ♪

06:37.420 --> 06:40.960
♪ Pour your sugar on me ♪

06:40.960 --> 06:42.530
♪ I can't get enough ♪

06:42.530 --> 06:46.230
♪ I'm hot, sticky sweet... ♪

06:46.230 --> 06:50.200
What can I say? I'm
entrepreneurialistic.

06:50.200 --> 06:51.340
Is that a word?

06:51.340 --> 06:53.610
I don't know. But if you
got a lot of money,

06:53.610 --> 06:55.580
you get to
make stuff up.
(chuckles)

06:55.580 --> 06:58.050
All right, well,
good luck.

06:59.550 --> 07:02.320
Hey, you look like
a Kit Kat man.
(knocking on door)

07:02.320 --> 07:04.120
Good news.

07:04.120 --> 07:06.190
You can take me to
the lecture after all.

07:06.190 --> 07:07.420
(chuckling):
Why is that?

07:07.420 --> 07:10.690
I told Dr. Linkletter
everything you--
Stop.

07:10.690 --> 07:13.760
Come inside.
Why?

07:13.760 --> 07:15.460
'Cause there's kids
in this neighborhood

07:15.460 --> 07:18.300
who don't need to hear
the language I'm about to use.

07:24.470 --> 07:27.740
What, exactly...
did you say

07:27.740 --> 07:30.010
to Dr. Linkletter?
I said...

07:30.010 --> 07:31.610
(quietly): Hello.
This is Sheldon Cooper.

07:31.610 --> 07:33.850
I'm speaking quietly because
I'm calling from the library.

07:33.850 --> 07:36.020
And he said...
Get to the point.

07:36.020 --> 07:38.490
He's not using me
to spend time with you.

07:38.490 --> 07:40.590
He said so.
You're wrong.

07:41.690 --> 07:44.160
You had no business
calling him, Sheldon.

07:44.160 --> 07:45.660
You seem upset.
Are you embarrassed

07:45.660 --> 07:46.930
because you were wrong?

07:46.930 --> 07:49.500
No.
Are you sure?
I would be.

07:49.500 --> 07:51.370
I'm not wrong.

07:51.370 --> 07:53.030
He's lying
to you, Sheldon.

07:53.030 --> 07:56.040
Interesting. I don't
know who to believe.
Really?

07:56.040 --> 07:58.310
You're gonna believe some guy
you barely know

07:58.310 --> 07:59.670
over your own grandmother?

07:59.670 --> 08:01.310
Well, one of them said
I'm really smart,

08:01.310 --> 08:03.040
and one of them's
yelling at me right now.

08:03.040 --> 08:05.280
We're done talking
about this.

08:05.280 --> 08:06.950
And I'm not taking you
to that lecture!

08:06.950 --> 08:09.750
But I really want to go.
Too bad!

08:10.620 --> 08:13.250
You are incredibly selfish.

08:25.300 --> 08:26.800
Excuse me?

08:26.800 --> 08:28.140
You just care about
what you want.

08:28.140 --> 08:29.770
You don't care about
what I want.

08:29.770 --> 08:31.270
You're selfish.

08:32.910 --> 08:34.710
How come your eyes
stopped blinking?

08:34.710 --> 08:37.080
(door slams)
(screaming): Mom!

08:37.080 --> 08:39.410
Meemaw swatted me on the bottom!
What?

08:39.410 --> 08:40.810
Why?

08:40.810 --> 08:42.350
I wanted something,
and then she said no,

08:42.350 --> 08:44.320
and then I called her selfish,
and then she went crazy!

08:44.320 --> 08:45.720
Let me call her.

08:45.720 --> 08:47.050
Really?

08:47.050 --> 08:48.960
You don't want to thank her
in person?

08:57.000 --> 08:58.370
Pardon me?
Mm-hm?

08:58.370 --> 09:00.600
I'm interested in
getting some jewelry.

09:00.600 --> 09:02.370
Well, sure,
what's the occasion?

09:02.370 --> 09:04.440
There's a young lady,
and I'd like to get her

09:04.440 --> 09:05.640
something special.

09:05.640 --> 09:07.140
Well, aren't you sweet?

09:07.140 --> 09:10.110
I like to think so.
So what are you
looking for?

09:10.110 --> 09:14.650
A necklace, ankle bracelet,
uh, earrings?

09:14.650 --> 09:18.490
Hmm... tough to choose between
her neck, ankles and ears.

09:18.490 --> 09:20.990
They're all smokin' hot.

09:22.060 --> 09:24.090
You were very rude
to your grandmother.

09:24.090 --> 09:25.890
Dad's rude to her all the time.

09:25.890 --> 09:28.100
That is not--
the point.

09:28.100 --> 09:30.160
Do you have anything
to say for yourself?

09:30.160 --> 09:32.530
Yes. I really wanted to go
to this lecture,

09:32.530 --> 09:35.770
and I understand
that I upset Meemaw very much.

09:37.000 --> 09:38.610
So which one of you
will be taking me?

09:38.610 --> 09:40.070
No one's taking you.

09:40.070 --> 09:41.480
You're not
going, Sheldon.

09:41.480 --> 09:44.140
You two are even more selfish
than Meemaw.

09:44.140 --> 09:45.550
How long you
grounded for?

09:45.550 --> 09:47.010
A month.

09:47.010 --> 09:48.680
That sounds right.

09:48.680 --> 09:50.350
Let me tell
you the move:

09:50.350 --> 09:54.190
You mix a bag of these with
a bag of these... mm, heaven.

09:54.190 --> 09:56.120
You just want me
to buy two bags.

09:56.120 --> 09:58.090
I just want you
to be happy.

09:58.090 --> 09:59.790
Fine.

10:00.630 --> 10:02.630
And now I'm happy.

10:02.630 --> 10:05.100
Veronica.
Oh, hey.

10:05.100 --> 10:06.900
Come here. I got
something for you.

10:06.900 --> 10:08.800
Ooh, is it candy?

10:08.800 --> 10:10.640
No, but it is
pretty sweet.

10:10.640 --> 10:12.270
Georgie,
what did you do?

10:12.270 --> 10:13.470
Just open it.

10:15.780 --> 10:17.640
This looks expensive.

10:17.640 --> 10:19.710
It was. Check out the price tag.

10:19.710 --> 10:21.780
$100?

10:21.780 --> 10:23.320
And that's without tax.

10:23.320 --> 10:24.950
I can't accept this.

10:24.950 --> 10:28.320
B-But I bought it for you.
Well, you shouldn't have.

10:28.320 --> 10:30.160
I don't get you.

10:30.160 --> 10:32.560
I went out of my way
to buy you something nice

10:32.560 --> 10:33.960
and you don't even want it.

10:33.960 --> 10:35.600
Georgie, it's too much.

10:35.600 --> 10:37.760
I mean, you're not gonna impress
me by throwing money around.

10:37.760 --> 10:39.100
You sure?

10:39.100 --> 10:42.140
In "Material Girl,"
Madonna loves it.

10:43.570 --> 10:46.070
ADULT SHELDON:
The world had stopped
making sense.

10:46.070 --> 10:49.610
A grown-up had lied to me,
my meemaw and I were at odds,

10:49.610 --> 10:51.510
I was in trouble
with my parents.

10:51.510 --> 10:53.950
I had to find a way
to restore balance.

10:53.950 --> 10:56.280
I'm leaving.
Okay, bye.

10:56.280 --> 10:58.690
Before I go, I need
to give this to you.

10:58.690 --> 11:00.190
(laughing)

11:00.190 --> 11:03.520
You're interrupting
television. What?

11:03.520 --> 11:05.960
I should be back later tonight,
but in case I'm not,

11:05.960 --> 11:07.960
this envelope contains
my whereabouts.

11:07.960 --> 11:11.570
Do not open it unless
you absolutely have to.

11:11.570 --> 11:14.070
That it?
Yes.

11:14.070 --> 11:15.270
Okay, bye.

11:26.180 --> 11:29.950
"I knew you were going to
open this the moment I left.

11:29.950 --> 11:32.250
"To slow you down I've shrouded

11:32.250 --> 11:35.190
my destination in code."

11:35.190 --> 11:37.190
What a dork.

11:56.910 --> 11:58.350
Hello.

11:58.350 --> 12:01.350
Am I correct that the bus
to Dallas has a stop in Rusk?

12:01.350 --> 12:02.650
Yup.

12:02.650 --> 12:04.420
I'd like to buy
one ticket, please.

12:04.420 --> 12:06.520
You need an adult to buy it.

12:06.520 --> 12:09.120
Oh, I didn't know.

12:09.120 --> 12:10.930
That's the rules.

12:10.930 --> 12:14.430
I'm just trying to visit
my friend in the hospital.

12:14.430 --> 12:16.260
Not the regular kind
of hospital,

12:16.260 --> 12:17.730
a psychiatric hospital.

12:17.730 --> 12:19.870
He's actually
a brilliant scientist

12:19.870 --> 12:21.970
in the field
of theoretical physics.

12:21.970 --> 12:24.840
Dr. John Sturgis, you may have
heard of him. Anyway,

12:24.840 --> 12:27.710
he's a great guy.
We're almost the same height...

12:27.710 --> 12:30.110
And then he and my meemaw
became a romantic item,

12:30.110 --> 12:31.950
not that there haven't been
bumps in the road.

12:31.950 --> 12:33.750
I actually helped them
by writing up

12:33.750 --> 12:36.480
a relationship agreement.
I love drawing up contracts.

12:36.480 --> 12:37.990
But I don't love drawing.
Interesting.

12:37.990 --> 12:40.190
Anyway,
he doesn't drive.

12:40.190 --> 12:42.920
Maybe one day he'll take a bus
and you'll get to meet him.

12:42.920 --> 12:46.260
Anyway, even though I'm clearly
her favorite grandchild,

12:46.260 --> 12:47.730
she swatted my bottom.

12:47.730 --> 12:49.200
It didn't hurt that much
physically,

12:49.200 --> 12:51.400
but emotionally,
it stung like the dickens.

12:51.400 --> 12:53.670
Here you go. One ticket
to Dallas with a stop in Rusk.

12:53.670 --> 12:55.770
But that's against the rules.

12:55.770 --> 12:57.340
I'm an adult, I bought it.

12:57.340 --> 12:59.410
Ooh, a loophole. Thank you.

12:59.410 --> 13:01.680
I'd tell you
all about

13:01.680 --> 13:03.350
the etymology of the word
"loophole,"

13:03.350 --> 13:06.350
but I have a bus to catch.

13:06.350 --> 13:08.680
(sighs)

13:08.680 --> 13:11.590
Tarzan, I thought you were dead.
MARY: I'm home.

13:11.590 --> 13:13.460
Hey.

13:13.460 --> 13:15.690
Hey, baby, where's Sheldon?

13:15.690 --> 13:16.960
I don't know, he left.

13:16.960 --> 13:18.630
He left?
Where'd he go?

13:18.630 --> 13:22.230
He wouldn't tell me, but he
wrote it in this weird letter.

13:28.700 --> 13:31.210
When did he leave?
An hour ago.

13:31.210 --> 13:33.210
An hour?!

13:33.210 --> 13:34.840
I told him not to go.

13:40.250 --> 13:42.580
Anyone sitting here?
No.

13:44.850 --> 13:47.590
Aren't you a little young
to be traveling alone?

13:47.590 --> 13:49.460
Yes, but I'm quite
a capable traveler.

13:49.460 --> 13:52.630
I've memorized the entire bus
schedule for the state of Texas.

13:52.630 --> 13:54.500
Ask me anything.
No, thanks.

13:54.500 --> 13:57.900
Okay, but if at any point you'd
like to know what time the bus

13:57.900 --> 14:00.800
from Waco arrives
in Houston, ask away.

14:02.140 --> 14:03.870
4:15, except on Fridays

14:03.870 --> 14:05.940
when they make a local stop
in Huntsville.

14:05.940 --> 14:08.840
No wonder this seat was empty.

14:08.840 --> 14:11.050
See you tomorrow.

14:13.350 --> 14:14.550
(groans)

14:14.550 --> 14:16.680
Georgie.

14:20.590 --> 14:22.660
"Before you get mad,

14:22.660 --> 14:26.030
this only cost me ten cents."

14:26.030 --> 14:28.130
(sighs)

14:31.370 --> 14:32.970
GEORGE JR.:
I saw you smile.

14:34.270 --> 14:36.070
Go away, Georgie.

14:36.070 --> 14:39.710
You can eat it or wear it,
it's up to you.

14:43.080 --> 14:44.750
Dots and dashes...

14:44.750 --> 14:47.350
Maybe it's Morse code.

14:47.350 --> 14:48.680
Where is he?

14:48.680 --> 14:51.350
We think this is Morse code.
What does it say?

14:51.350 --> 14:52.820
Gee, I don't know.

14:52.820 --> 14:55.220
What do you mean you don't know?
You were in the Army.

14:55.220 --> 14:57.690
Yeah, so? Can't do
a push-up, either.

14:57.690 --> 14:59.030
Well, that's a separate problem.

14:59.030 --> 15:01.330
Okay, so how
do we read it?

15:01.330 --> 15:05.130
I'd say ask Sheldon, but he left
after I clearly said not to.

15:06.400 --> 15:09.640
There must be a book
on Morse code in here somewhere.

15:09.640 --> 15:11.370
Okay, where do we look?
I don't know.

15:11.370 --> 15:14.610
I know how to use
the card catalog.
Go, go!

15:16.410 --> 15:18.950
You're just useless, aren't you?

15:23.420 --> 15:24.820
Did you have
tuna for lunch

15:24.820 --> 15:26.750
or do you just smell
like that all the time?

15:26.750 --> 15:28.190
What?

15:28.190 --> 15:30.090
Did you have tuna for lunch
or do you smell like...

15:30.090 --> 15:33.030
I heard it. I'm just
wondering who raised you.

15:33.030 --> 15:36.030
My mother and father,
and I suppose my meemaw.

15:36.030 --> 15:38.900
Well, they don't seem like
they're doing a great job.

15:38.900 --> 15:40.300
Tell me about it.

15:40.300 --> 15:43.040
It's been quite the week.

15:43.040 --> 15:45.970
I'm sure I'll regret this,
but...

15:45.970 --> 15:47.740
(sighs) ...how so?

15:47.740 --> 15:49.110
Before I tell
you the story,

15:49.110 --> 15:50.980
how much do you know
about the mathematics

15:50.980 --> 15:52.380
of robotic communication?

15:53.980 --> 15:57.090
That's okay. I'll put it into
terms a bus lady can understand.

15:57.090 --> 15:58.720
There's a wide range
of protocols

15:58.720 --> 15:59.920
used for
inter-robotic...
(sighs)

15:59.920 --> 16:02.120
Dot, dot, dot.
Uh, "S."

16:02.120 --> 16:03.320
Got it.

16:03.320 --> 16:04.360
Dot.
"E."

16:04.360 --> 16:06.530
All right.
Another dot, dot, dot.

16:06.530 --> 16:08.460
Uh, "S" again.
Okay.

16:08.460 --> 16:09.730
What do we have so far?

16:09.730 --> 16:12.370
"I am taking a bus.

16:12.370 --> 16:15.040
Fun fact about buses..."

16:15.040 --> 16:17.210
You got to be kidding me.
Oh, Lord.
Come on!

16:17.210 --> 16:20.140
So how old is this
professor friend of yours?

16:20.140 --> 16:21.340
73 and a half.

16:21.340 --> 16:23.410
And why are you
going to see him?

16:23.410 --> 16:26.150
Because everything made sense
before he went away,

16:26.150 --> 16:27.920
and now no one's
on my side.

16:27.920 --> 16:31.490
So you think only a person
in a mental hospital

16:31.490 --> 16:33.450
can understand you?
Correct.

16:33.450 --> 16:36.690
That's the first thing
you've said that sounds right.

16:38.190 --> 16:40.530
Does he really think
these facts are fun?

16:40.530 --> 16:41.760
Not now.

16:41.760 --> 16:44.170
I've got it.
He's headed to Rusk.

16:44.170 --> 16:46.530
He's going to the hospital
to see John.

16:46.530 --> 16:48.300
I'll call the police.
Hurry!

16:48.300 --> 16:51.040
Is Sheldon going
to jail?
No!

16:51.040 --> 16:52.740
Damn it.

16:52.740 --> 16:55.240
And then they grounded me.
Can you believe it?

16:55.240 --> 16:56.240
Yes.

16:56.240 --> 16:58.410
But I didn't do
anything wrong.

16:58.410 --> 16:59.780
You did everything wrong.

16:59.780 --> 17:01.980
You were nothing
but rude and ungrateful.

17:01.980 --> 17:03.620
You really think so?

17:03.620 --> 17:06.750
The only selfish person
in that story is you.

17:06.750 --> 17:10.590
There's a Star Trek episode
called "The Devil in the Dark"

17:10.590 --> 17:12.930
where the miners thought
the Horta was the monster,

17:12.930 --> 17:15.030
but actually the miners
were the monsters

17:15.030 --> 17:16.860
because they were
killing its eggs.

17:16.860 --> 17:18.730
Are you saying
it's like that?

17:18.730 --> 17:21.870
Sure.
(sirens wailing)

17:23.670 --> 17:25.470
State troopers.

17:25.470 --> 17:26.940
I wonder what they want.

17:26.940 --> 17:28.610
ADULT SHELDON:
It turns out they wanted me.

17:28.610 --> 17:31.310
Fun fact,
this was one of seven times

17:31.310 --> 17:33.620
I was brought home
by law enforcement--

17:33.620 --> 17:35.350
once, on the back of a horse.

17:38.260 --> 17:40.260
They're coming.

17:43.090 --> 17:44.490
ADULT SHELDON:
A kind stranger on a bus

17:44.490 --> 17:47.230
helped me see
how I hurt my family

17:47.230 --> 17:49.530
and that I owed them
the best apology

17:49.530 --> 17:50.770
I knew how to give.

17:50.770 --> 17:53.140
No, don't fire!

17:53.140 --> 17:55.370
Kill it!
First man that fires is dead.

17:57.270 --> 17:58.980
That thing has killed
50 of my men.

17:58.980 --> 18:01.210
You've killed thousands
of her children.

18:01.210 --> 18:02.250
What?

18:02.250 --> 18:04.780
Those round
silicon nodules

18:04.780 --> 18:08.120
that you've been collecting and
destroying? They're her eggs.

18:12.020 --> 18:13.620
Tell them, Mr. Spock.

18:13.620 --> 18:17.230
There have been many generations
of Horta on this planet...

18:17.230 --> 18:21.130
I think you all understand
why I wanted to show you this.

18:21.130 --> 18:22.330
No.

18:23.500 --> 18:26.170
It's an apology.

18:26.170 --> 18:28.540
I was the miners,
you were the Horta.

18:28.540 --> 18:30.570
How about just saying,
"I'm sorry"?

18:30.570 --> 18:33.840
Wow, you're really
not getting this.

18:33.840 --> 18:35.080
Let's watch it again.

18:35.080 --> 18:36.480
SPOCK:
...the eggs live.
