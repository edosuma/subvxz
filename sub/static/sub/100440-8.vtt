00:40.394 --> 00:42.198
Mac, I'm trained in six
different martial arts.

00:42.222 --> 00:44.156
You sure you don't
want to quit? I'm pretty tough.

00:44.180 --> 00:46.356
I can take it. So, you're saying
you want to get hurt?

♪ Big time, here we go ♪

00:51.622 --> 00:55.322
See, fighting is basically
physics and biology, Dez.

00:55.365 --> 00:57.454
Every action has an equal
and opposite reaction.

00:57.498 --> 00:59.543
It all comes down
to snap judgments

00:59.587 --> 01:01.589
based on strength...

01:01.632 --> 01:03.243
velocity and...

01:04.940 --> 01:06.898
Balance. Oh, no!

01:08.117 --> 01:10.076
Look at that,
you finally swept me

All's fair in love
and war, right?

01:21.174 --> 01:22.740
300 on Desi.

01:22.784 --> 01:23.872
Oh, that's a no-brainer.

01:23.915 --> 01:25.178
I'll take those odds.

01:25.221 --> 01:26.459
Look, if I've learned one thing

01:26.483 --> 01:27.919
it's never bet against...

01:30.879 --> 01:32.620
Never mind.

01:56.165 --> 01:58.298
An explosive device

01:58.341 --> 02:00.276
was detonated in a federal
building early this morning

02:00.300 --> 02:01.997
in downtown Los Angeles.

02:02.040 --> 02:04.565
What you're seeing is cell phone
footage captured at the scene.

02:04.608 --> 02:06.436
No fatalities yet reported,

02:06.480 --> 02:08.743
and authorities have
no further information...

02:08.786 --> 02:10.875
I'm getting files
routed from the FBI now.

02:10.919 --> 02:12.225
So it's not a gas main, then?

02:12.268 --> 02:13.637
No,
the way the blasts detonated,

02:13.661 --> 02:14.662
they were controlled.

02:14.705 --> 02:15.880
It was a series of devices.

02:15.924 --> 02:18.405
That bomb was just
a few blocks from here.

02:18.448 --> 02:20.711
Someone...

02:20.755 --> 02:22.670
is sending a message.

02:22.713 --> 02:23.845
Dad.

02:23.888 --> 02:25.890
Angus.

02:25.934 --> 02:27.196
It's good to see you.

02:27.240 --> 02:29.198
Yeah.

02:29.242 --> 02:31.026
You, too.

02:31.069 --> 02:32.636
Your father had some

02:32.680 --> 02:35.987
theories on the bomber,
so I had him come in.

02:36.031 --> 02:37.772
Russ Taylor.
Russ!

02:37.815 --> 02:39.295
Good to finally meet
you face-to-face.

02:39.339 --> 02:42.211
Well, you left some
rather big shoes to fill.

02:42.255 --> 02:44.257
So you have an idea
who this guy is?

02:44.300 --> 02:46.259
Mason.

02:46.302 --> 02:47.869
Mason? Mason,

02:47.912 --> 02:49.629
the former FBI psycho
that infiltrated Phoenix?

02:49.653 --> 02:51.307
That's the one.

02:51.351 --> 02:52.395
Career FBI,

02:52.439 --> 02:53.590
before that, decorated soldier,

02:53.614 --> 02:55.224
awarded a purple heart.

02:55.268 --> 02:56.462
All before branching out

02:56.486 --> 02:58.445
into the psychopathic
revenge killings.

02:58.488 --> 03:00.142
I've been tracking him.

03:00.186 --> 03:02.797
He's somewhere near here,
Los Angeles.

03:02.840 --> 03:05.887
It would've been
his son's 30th birthday.

03:05.930 --> 03:07.671
Ballistics came back

03:07.715 --> 03:08.779
on the device used this morning.

03:08.803 --> 03:10.718
Oh, yeah.

03:10.761 --> 03:13.373
This is asymmetrical timing,
old-school blasting caps.

03:13.416 --> 03:14.741
It definitely looks
like his handiwork.

03:14.765 --> 03:16.332
Except for one thing.

03:16.376 --> 03:18.378
The blast site
is an empty building.

03:18.421 --> 03:20.031
No casualties.

03:20.075 --> 03:21.511
Not exactly Mason's style.

03:21.555 --> 03:23.557
I connected Mason

03:23.600 --> 03:24.993
to three aliases.

03:25.036 --> 03:27.125
One of them, Theodore Ramse,

03:27.169 --> 03:29.476
is the name on this property
outside of Needles,

03:29.519 --> 03:30.346
a couple hours from here.

03:30.390 --> 03:32.305
And there's this.

03:32.348 --> 03:34.524
Taken yesterday
inside of a bank,

03:34.568 --> 03:36.831
just one block
from the blast sight.

03:36.874 --> 03:38.528
All this to send us
a message, huh?

03:38.572 --> 03:40.356
Hmm, not "us."

03:40.400 --> 03:42.576
Just me and Dad, right?

03:42.619 --> 03:44.423
That's why I want you
to come with me to get him.

03:44.447 --> 03:45.816
Why not just send
the FBI to pick him up?

03:45.840 --> 03:46.904
Because Mason has friends

03:46.928 --> 03:48.253
in the FBI...
He catches wind of this,

03:48.277 --> 03:49.278
we'll lose him again.

03:49.322 --> 03:51.454
Not to mention, Mason's

03:51.498 --> 03:53.543
our mess, we should be
the ones to clean it up.

03:54.805 --> 03:55.719
Listen,

03:55.763 --> 03:57.243
about that other thing, Matty,

03:57.286 --> 03:58.679
I want you to stay on it.

03:58.722 --> 04:00.115
You're onto something.

04:01.247 --> 04:03.640
Russ.
Nice to meet you.

04:03.684 --> 04:06.208
Bozer, Desi, I want you to look

04:06.252 --> 04:07.949
into any of Mason's
known contacts

04:07.992 --> 04:09.385
in the area.
Riley?

04:09.429 --> 04:10.908
Go a layer deeper

04:10.952 --> 04:12.649
on those surveillance
scans, okay?

04:12.693 --> 04:13.737
NSA systems,

04:13.781 --> 04:15.304
here I come.

04:16.784 --> 04:19.743
Okay, well, I will
see you later, then?

04:19.786 --> 04:21.789
Why, you have something
more pressing?

04:21.832 --> 04:23.791
Yes.

04:23.834 --> 04:25.880
Care to elaborate?

04:25.923 --> 04:27.534
No.

04:28.839 --> 04:31.015
All right.

04:31.059 --> 04:33.670
Would you please close
the door on your way out?

04:33.714 --> 04:35.716
Pleasure.

04:55.823 --> 04:57.607
Happy belated birthday,
by the way.

04:57.651 --> 04:58.782
I called.

04:58.826 --> 05:00.871
I know.

05:00.915 --> 05:04.092
Well, you know,
phones go both ways.

05:04.135 --> 05:06.442
Oh.

05:06.486 --> 05:08.028
You made it clear you
didn't want to talk to me,

05:08.052 --> 05:10.881
because... well...

05:10.925 --> 05:13.928
Because you traded
Mason's son's life for mine.

05:13.971 --> 05:16.931
Because you...
put that on my head.

05:16.974 --> 05:18.846
You never gave me
a choice in the matter.

05:18.889 --> 05:21.152
You played God.

05:21.196 --> 05:24.068
And now, here we are,
after Mason again.

05:24.112 --> 05:26.854
Mason's son was a good soldier,

05:26.897 --> 05:28.899
but he was expendable.

05:28.943 --> 05:30.771
I know that's hard, but it's true.

05:34.383 --> 05:38.953
You were the invaluable asset that day.

05:38.996 --> 05:41.390
Mason's son died so you could live

05:41.434 --> 05:43.697
and continue your work,

05:43.740 --> 05:45.176
saving countless lives.

05:45.220 --> 05:46.632
Sometimes you got to do the wrong thing

05:46.656 --> 05:48.832
for the right reason, and you know what?

05:48.876 --> 05:51.487
I'd make the same
damn choice all over again.

06:06.459 --> 06:07.764
Operator 187.

06:07.808 --> 06:09.375
Yes, it's Matilda.

06:09.418 --> 06:13.248
Clearance level Q17.

06:13.291 --> 06:15.250
Not available.

06:15.293 --> 06:17.948
Tell him I'll wait.

06:17.992 --> 06:19.907
Message, please?

06:19.950 --> 06:21.430
Okay, fine.

06:21.474 --> 06:24.825
The message is:
"Call me.

06:24.868 --> 06:27.175
It's about File 47."

06:32.746 --> 06:36.053
Okay,
so this road should lead us to the

06:36.097 --> 06:38.055
property leased
under Mason's alias.

06:40.710 --> 06:43.974
You know, I was gonna retire
in a place like this.

06:44.018 --> 06:45.846
A little farther east.

06:45.889 --> 06:47.674
Big lake.

06:47.717 --> 06:48.849
Fish.

06:48.892 --> 06:50.328
Sounds nice.

06:50.372 --> 06:52.156
Yeah, you and me.

06:52.200 --> 06:54.855
On a boat.

06:54.898 --> 06:57.118
We went fishing exactly once.

06:57.161 --> 06:59.163
I wouldn't say it was our thing.

07:00.730 --> 07:02.384
I should've been more...

07:02.428 --> 07:03.951
Stop.

07:03.994 --> 07:06.867
Stop, just, you keep acting
like there's something to fix.

07:06.910 --> 07:08.608
There's nothing
to fix between us.

07:08.651 --> 07:10.914
I grew up without a dad,
that's just how it was.

07:10.958 --> 07:12.046
No dad.

07:12.089 --> 07:14.091
No mom, either.

07:16.703 --> 07:19.183
She would've been here
if she could've.

07:21.925 --> 07:24.754
We never talk about her.

07:24.798 --> 07:26.756
That's what families do,
you know?

07:26.800 --> 07:29.193
Talk about things,
even the hard stuff.

07:31.979 --> 07:34.416
Okay.

07:34.460 --> 07:36.462
The hard stuff?

07:38.072 --> 07:40.204
The cancer's back.

07:40.248 --> 07:43.512
Doctors say I have
a couple months to live,

07:43.556 --> 07:45.558
at best.

07:47.995 --> 07:49.649
Mac!

07:49.692 --> 07:51.085
Look out!

07:57.352 --> 07:59.223
Is that what I think it is?

07:59.267 --> 08:01.835
If you think it's

08:01.878 --> 08:04.185
a remote control
anti-personnel mine,

08:04.228 --> 08:05.902
magnetically attached
to the hood of my truck,

08:05.926 --> 08:07.884
then, yes, it's exactly
what you think it is.

08:07.928 --> 08:09.930
Mason set up a trap
for anyone coming his way.

08:09.973 --> 08:10.994
At least we know he's here.

08:11.018 --> 08:12.498
Phoenix, we have a problem.

08:14.021 --> 08:15.196
Phoenix?

08:15.239 --> 08:18.068
Riley, are... are you there?
Do you copy?

08:18.112 --> 08:20.288
Nothing.

08:20.331 --> 08:21.594
He's jamming our signal.

08:21.637 --> 08:22.899
Do you see

08:22.943 --> 08:25.336
that metal box on top?

08:25.380 --> 08:27.077
Yeah, it's a motion sensor...
We get out...

08:27.121 --> 08:28.688
it goes off.

08:28.731 --> 08:31.081
So we're trapped.

08:38.001 --> 08:39.152
Mac? Mac, can you hear me?

08:39.176 --> 08:40.568
Mac!
What's wrong?

08:40.613 --> 08:42.309
I don't know... his comm went dead,

08:42.352 --> 08:44.094
and now I have no signal.

08:44.138 --> 08:45.574
There's too much tree cover.

08:45.618 --> 08:46.749
Can't make anything out.

08:46.793 --> 08:48.751
I'm gonna enhance the receiver.

08:55.062 --> 08:56.933
Nothing.

08:56.977 --> 08:59.022
We lost them.

08:59.066 --> 09:01.242
All right, well,
we can't just sit here.

09:01.285 --> 09:03.113
What, you're not gonna…
Short it out? Yes.

09:03.157 --> 09:04.700
It'll set off the charge.
Maybe, but it's better

09:04.724 --> 09:06.116
than waiting out the whims

09:06.160 --> 09:07.398
of a dangerous psychopath
with a remote

09:07.422 --> 09:08.771
control, so...

09:08.815 --> 09:10.251
So, let's play the odds.

09:10.294 --> 09:11.774
Yeah.

09:11.818 --> 09:13.689
Speaker wire?

09:13.733 --> 09:15.101
That's a little flimsy,
don't you think?

09:15.125 --> 09:16.997
As good a conductor as any.

09:17.040 --> 09:19.260
You're gonna need a control rod.

09:19.303 --> 09:21.697
How about this? Hockey?

09:21.741 --> 09:22.872
Yeah.

09:22.916 --> 09:24.134
It's Desi's.

09:27.964 --> 09:30.184
I can't believe you didn't
tell me about the cancer.

09:30.227 --> 09:31.315
I just did.

09:31.359 --> 09:35.276
That was... absolute
worst timing.

09:35.319 --> 09:37.104
Is there a good time for cancer?

09:37.147 --> 09:40.150
Yes, there's,
there's better times.

09:40.194 --> 09:42.849
I'm-I'm not good at this stuff.

09:42.892 --> 09:46.113
I'm sorry, but I-I-I just,
I never know what to say.

09:49.377 --> 09:51.118
Can we just start over?

09:51.161 --> 09:53.599
Right here, right now.

09:53.642 --> 09:56.384
Day one.

09:56.427 --> 09:58.473
We already did that.

09:58.516 --> 10:02.172
Well, I'm... I'm willing to try again.

10:05.306 --> 10:07.264
Have you boosted their comms signal?

10:07.308 --> 10:08.938
Four times already,
and they're still down.

10:08.962 --> 10:10.224
Nothing's working.

10:10.267 --> 10:12.269
Anything yet? Working on it.

10:12.313 --> 10:14.271
Nothing on Mason from
any known contacts.

10:14.315 --> 10:16.273
If he's in the city,
he's laying low.

10:16.317 --> 10:18.164
Hang on, there's a clearing
in the tree cover to the east.

10:18.188 --> 10:20.016
I'm gonna re-route
another satellite.

10:20.060 --> 10:22.018
You're not gonna be
re-routing anything.

10:22.062 --> 10:23.063
Riley, right?

10:23.106 --> 10:24.325
Shut her down, all of it.

10:24.368 --> 10:25.848
Hello. Russ Taylor,

10:25.892 --> 10:27.304
owner of everything you're
trying to shut down.

10:27.328 --> 10:29.330
Who the hell are you,
and on whose authority?

10:29.373 --> 10:30.418
CIA, by order

10:30.461 --> 10:33.160
of the executive branch.

10:33.203 --> 10:35.162
I said shut her down,
and I won't repeat myself.

10:35.205 --> 10:36.946
I don't work for you.

10:36.990 --> 10:38.469
Oh.
Hey!

10:39.819 --> 10:41.734
Stand down!

10:41.777 --> 10:43.561
You're gonna want to be cool.

10:43.605 --> 10:44.737
We're in the middle

10:44.780 --> 10:46.086
of an operation here, Burke.

10:46.129 --> 10:47.696
Not anymore you're not, Webber.

10:47.740 --> 10:49.219
Of course you two
know each other.

10:49.263 --> 10:51.961
Bring her
to an interrogation room.

10:52.005 --> 10:54.224
I'll show you the way.

10:54.268 --> 10:55.225
Matty.

10:55.269 --> 10:57.097
I got this.

11:04.539 --> 11:06.062
Russ, what the hell is going on?

11:06.106 --> 11:07.977
I don't know.

11:08.021 --> 11:09.762
So this means Mac
and Oversight are just...

11:09.805 --> 11:12.068
They're on their own.

11:12.112 --> 11:14.810
Steady. Steady...

11:17.770 --> 11:18.901
Now!

11:20.816 --> 11:22.644
Nice.

11:22.688 --> 11:23.993
Well done.

11:24.037 --> 11:25.865
Let's just get out of here.

11:27.736 --> 11:29.136
I shorted out the
electrical system.

11:30.347 --> 11:31.784
So I guess we're walking.

11:37.267 --> 11:39.269
Love this truck.

11:40.227 --> 11:42.403
So what are we doing now?

11:42.446 --> 11:44.492
Oh, I'm not stopping'
till I find Mason.

11:49.323 --> 11:51.281
Hey, Dad, I, uh...

11:51.325 --> 11:56.025
Look, I'm-I'm... I'm sorry
for not telling you about it.

11:56.069 --> 11:59.115
I was just gonna say,
I should have been there.

11:59.159 --> 12:00.638
And done what?

12:00.682 --> 12:02.510
Sit by my bedside?

12:02.553 --> 12:05.339
Look, I'm-I'm... I'm doing
pretty good right now.

12:07.471 --> 12:09.778
Look, I know I wasn't exactly...

12:09.822 --> 12:12.389
father of the year.

12:13.216 --> 12:15.262
We can't change the past.

12:17.177 --> 12:19.135
I couldn't have said it better myself.

12:21.834 --> 12:24.445
And now that we've all
gathered here today,

12:24.488 --> 12:27.535
why don't we just take a little
walk down memory lane?

12:36.326 --> 12:37.675
I figured it might be you

12:37.719 --> 12:39.939
crawling out of your hole
on this one.

12:39.982 --> 12:42.158
But it's a corner hole
on the twenty-fourth floor

12:42.202 --> 12:44.160
with my own bathroom
and a view of downtown.

12:44.204 --> 12:47.381
Well, I am sorry
to hear about your success.

12:47.424 --> 12:49.165
What do you know about File 47?

12:49.209 --> 12:52.038
Oh. I thought we were still
throwing warm-up pitches.

12:52.081 --> 12:54.867
Oh, you're gonna tell me what
I want to know, and quickly,

12:54.910 --> 12:57.130
or this whole
candy store operation

12:57.173 --> 12:59.828
is gonna be closed for good.
On what grounds?

12:59.872 --> 13:02.091
Stealing a top secret
project from DARPA.

13:02.135 --> 13:03.223
Well-documented set up.

13:03.266 --> 13:04.833
Operating
in two foreign countries

13:04.877 --> 13:06.835
without government permission:

13:06.879 --> 13:08.445
Moldova and Italy.

13:08.489 --> 13:10.708
Now there's a career-ending
stain on your résumé.

13:10.752 --> 13:12.319
I don't know much about File 47.

13:12.362 --> 13:14.364
But you do know about it,
which is way more

13:14.408 --> 13:15.626
than anyone is supposed to.

13:15.670 --> 13:18.325
What I know is that
it had something to do

13:18.368 --> 13:21.328
with a long-term plan
to combat global threats,

13:21.371 --> 13:23.199
from climate change
to unstable governments

13:23.243 --> 13:24.940
and everything in between.

13:24.984 --> 13:26.768
How did you find out about it?

13:26.812 --> 13:29.162
You know, I figured
this was coming,

13:29.205 --> 13:31.599
which is why I checked
into the occupancy

13:31.642 --> 13:34.254
of our California black
sites on the way over.

13:34.297 --> 13:36.212
And there's plenty of vacancies.

13:36.256 --> 13:38.780
So I wonder
how long Matty the Hun

13:38.824 --> 13:41.174
can withstand a little...

13:41.217 --> 13:44.090
enhanced interrogation.

13:47.876 --> 13:50.444
Right. This is ridiculous.

13:50.487 --> 13:52.402
I'm ordering all of you
back to work.

13:52.446 --> 13:54.143
Do not touch that laptop.

13:54.187 --> 13:56.121
Your operation's on a
government-ordered lockdown.

13:56.145 --> 13:58.017
Right. Enough of this humbug.

13:58.060 --> 13:59.235
I can't let you...

13:59.279 --> 14:00.541
Uh-uh!

14:00.584 --> 14:02.282
Mike? Russ.

14:02.325 --> 14:05.589
I wonder if you can help me out
with my current predicament.

14:05.633 --> 14:07.635
I've got a bit of
a sitch with the CIA.

14:14.903 --> 14:17.210
I like it. Rustic.

14:17.253 --> 14:19.299
Very stark.

14:20.909 --> 14:23.216
You know our team's gonna
come looking for us, right?

14:23.259 --> 14:24.695
You know, I don't really care.

14:24.739 --> 14:26.915
Today's my son's30th birthday.

14:26.959 --> 14:28.545
At least it would have been
if it wasn't for him.

14:28.569 --> 14:30.373
Look, you want to settle
this thing between us,

14:30.397 --> 14:31.354
let's do it, but leave

14:31.398 --> 14:32.573
Angus out of it.

14:32.616 --> 14:34.880
I knew you two would come
looking for me.

14:34.923 --> 14:38.840
It's hard to stay off
the grid these days.

14:38.884 --> 14:40.450
It'd be a lot easier

14:40.494 --> 14:41.894
if you didn't blow up
that building.

14:43.453 --> 14:45.020
What building?

14:45.064 --> 14:46.500
Downtown.

14:46.543 --> 14:48.284
You wanted our attention.
You got it.

14:48.328 --> 14:50.112
I haven't been to the city
in months.

14:50.156 --> 14:52.245
We have you
on security footage yesterday.

14:52.288 --> 14:53.986
Your truck is dead,
I have this gun.

14:54.029 --> 14:55.770
Why would I be lying to you now?

14:55.813 --> 14:57.728
The only reason l came out looking

14:57.772 --> 14:59.772
for you two is because
you knocked out my receiver.

15:00.775 --> 15:02.733
We didn't knock out
your receiver.

15:02.777 --> 15:06.302
Like I say, I have the gun,
so why are you lying?

15:06.346 --> 15:08.565
Our comms were killed, too.
We thought you did it.

15:08.609 --> 15:10.009
Someone's been jamming
our signal...

15:10.567 --> 15:12.961
Get down!

15:17.574 --> 15:19.794
Friends of yours?

15:20.926 --> 15:22.014
Definitely not!

15:33.939 --> 15:35.462
Who are those guys?

15:35.505 --> 15:37.225
I don't know,
but we got to get out of here.

15:45.820 --> 15:46.777
Maybe we can

15:46.821 --> 15:48.021
make something to hold 'em off.

15:51.304 --> 15:52.435
Oh, that works.

15:55.134 --> 15:57.788
Take this, head for the end
of the tunnel. I've got

15:57.832 --> 15:59.225
a remote detonator.

15:59.268 --> 16:00.487
This should cover our exfil.

16:00.530 --> 16:02.489
We're supposed
to just trust you? No, but

16:02.532 --> 16:04.119
the same people shooting at
you are shooting at me,

16:04.143 --> 16:05.883
and I want to find out why. Go!

16:24.076 --> 16:25.512
Go! Go! Go!

16:39.178 --> 16:40.416
So what's it gonna be, Matilda?

16:40.440 --> 16:41.832
Black site or the truth?

16:41.876 --> 16:44.357
I want to know
what you know about File 47.

16:45.401 --> 16:47.012
Not sorry to interrupt.

16:47.055 --> 16:51.146
I have the secretary of
defense on the phone for you.

16:51.190 --> 16:53.279
Really? Mm.

16:55.194 --> 16:56.412
Hello. Mike?

16:56.456 --> 16:58.458
Yeah.

16:58.501 --> 17:00.025
Hey, listen, Mike, uh,

17:00.068 --> 17:02.331
you want to keep your nose
clean on this one.

17:02.375 --> 17:04.507
Mm-hmm. Oh, yeah, straight

17:04.550 --> 17:07.075
from the big desk. All right.

17:07.118 --> 17:10.078
Yeah, listen,
love to Peggy, huh? All right.

17:10.122 --> 17:11.732
Get him out of here.

17:11.775 --> 17:12.950
Hang on.

17:12.993 --> 17:14.517
I demand to be here
with Ms. Webber.

17:14.560 --> 17:16.040
I have the clearance.

17:16.084 --> 17:17.105
Not on this one, you don't.

17:17.128 --> 17:18.868
This is compartmentalized.

17:18.913 --> 17:20.175
Why are you here?

17:20.219 --> 17:22.002
They want to find out what I know

17:22.047 --> 17:25.659
about something
called "File 47."

17:25.702 --> 17:27.095
A top secret project

17:27.138 --> 17:29.706
initiated by DXS 14 years ago.

17:29.750 --> 17:32.840
Highly sensitive information.

17:32.883 --> 17:35.147
But the problem

17:35.190 --> 17:37.018
is that Burke here
doesn't know what to ask.

17:37.062 --> 17:38.715
You want to know why?

17:38.759 --> 17:40.674
Because not

17:40.717 --> 17:42.371
even he knows

17:42.415 --> 17:44.069
what File 47 is.

17:44.112 --> 17:46.027
It's just a big hole

17:46.071 --> 17:48.508
where all this juicy intel
should live.

17:48.551 --> 17:51.511
But what exactly is
that juicy intel?

17:51.554 --> 17:53.861
So you can't tell me anything?

17:53.904 --> 17:57.125
Oh, no, I can tell you
lots of things.

17:57.169 --> 17:59.084
Like how you led
the operation that

17:59.127 --> 18:03.175
killed off everyone involved
in designing File 47,

18:03.218 --> 18:05.220
despite the fact that

18:05.264 --> 18:07.048
you had no idea

18:07.092 --> 18:09.442
what... it even...

18:09.485 --> 18:11.487
was.

18:12.532 --> 18:14.577
And how do you know all this?

18:40.647 --> 18:42.605
Let me take a look at it.

18:42.649 --> 18:44.564
No, it's fine. Well, it's
slowing you down,

18:44.607 --> 18:46.348
and we don't know the area,

18:46.392 --> 18:49.177
so unfortunately...

18:49.221 --> 18:52.659
I've seen my fair share of
shrapnel wounds. Come on.

19:00.362 --> 19:03.191
Removing shrapnel is tricky business.

19:03.235 --> 19:04.671
Without the right tools, you can

19:04.714 --> 19:08.153
cause an infection that's worse
than the wound itself.

19:08.196 --> 19:10.155
But shrapnel is metal,
and with an electromagnet,

19:10.198 --> 19:12.157
you can pull it free
without ever having

19:12.200 --> 19:13.767
to expose the wound.

19:17.510 --> 19:19.076
All right, apply pressure.

19:19.120 --> 19:20.208
It's all we can do for now.

19:20.252 --> 19:21.992
We'll rest a minute.
Is that what you do?

19:22.036 --> 19:23.733
Just help people,
no matter who they are?

19:23.777 --> 19:27.128
Yeah, well, I try to when I can,
but don't read too far into it.

19:27.172 --> 19:28.521
We're not friends.

19:28.564 --> 19:30.305
Nobody's forgetting what
you did to Charlie.

19:30.349 --> 19:32.220
And I'm not forgetting my son.

19:32.264 --> 19:34.329
But the same person shooting
at you is shooting at me.

19:34.353 --> 19:36.200
So you got any idea just
who in the hell is trying

19:36.224 --> 19:37.443
to set the three of us up?

19:37.486 --> 19:39.445
We don't have
any common enemies.

19:39.488 --> 19:40.968
And if you really
weren't in L.A.,

19:41.011 --> 19:43.927
somebody deep-faked you
into that security footage.

19:43.971 --> 19:46.147
Somebody with resources.

19:46.191 --> 19:47.279
It was Codex.

19:48.845 --> 19:51.283
Who?

19:51.326 --> 19:54.547
They're some sort of...
extremist organization.

19:54.590 --> 19:57.245
We don't really know.
Delusions of grandeur.

19:57.289 --> 19:59.160
Ending civilization
kind of stuff.

19:59.204 --> 20:03.556
Well, they're after us, so we
better keep moving. Let's go.

20:08.952 --> 20:11.041
You realize you're leaving

20:11.085 --> 20:14.349
two U.S. operatives
in the field in the dark

20:14.393 --> 20:15.959
on an active mission?

20:16.003 --> 20:17.526
That's not my problem, Miss.

20:17.570 --> 20:18.721
You can keep
telling yourself that,

20:18.745 --> 20:21.051
but if they die, it's on you.

20:21.095 --> 20:23.315
Um...

20:23.358 --> 20:25.055
Sit down.

20:25.099 --> 20:26.274
What is that?

20:26.318 --> 20:28.145
It's my alarm, okay? I need

20:28.189 --> 20:29.601
to take my meds.
I always forget at lunch.

20:29.625 --> 20:31.236
That's why I set this alarm.
Excuse me.

20:31.279 --> 20:33.281
Yo, this isn't

20:33.325 --> 20:35.327
a choice, okay? I'll die.
They're glycerin

20:35.370 --> 20:36.589
for my heart.

20:36.632 --> 20:38.025
Where are they?

20:38.068 --> 20:39.635
Downstairs in the lab.

20:39.679 --> 20:41.724
Escort him.

20:51.647 --> 20:52.648
Look, don't make me...

21:06.662 --> 21:08.316
This is our house

21:08.360 --> 21:10.405
You got cords?

21:10.449 --> 21:12.059
Yeah, I got some cords.

21:24.419 --> 21:25.638
Let's find Mac.

21:32.688 --> 21:34.342
Mac, do you copy? Riley?

21:34.386 --> 21:35.343
Where the hell have you been?

21:35.387 --> 21:36.344
Long story.

21:36.388 --> 21:37.345
CIA came in armed to the teeth

21:37.389 --> 21:38.409
and shut down the whole op.

21:38.433 --> 21:39.478
We don't know why.

21:39.521 --> 21:41.044
Matty and Taylor are
with them now.

21:41.088 --> 21:43.220
So we're in the dark with
Codex on our heels?

21:43.264 --> 21:44.526
Codex?

21:44.570 --> 21:45.982
What happened to Mason?
He's with us.

21:46.006 --> 21:48.443
He had nothing to do
with the explosion in L.A.

21:48.487 --> 21:49.662
Codex set a trap.

21:49.705 --> 21:51.359
I'm pulling up your location.

21:51.403 --> 21:53.318
I got a satellite that's...

21:53.361 --> 21:55.165
Mac, you've got heat
signatures heading your way.

21:55.189 --> 21:56.549
A lot of 'em. From what direction?

21:56.582 --> 21:58.540
All of them.

22:00.716 --> 22:01.804
Mac?

22:14.426 --> 22:15.862
Angus MacGyver.

22:15.905 --> 22:17.211
Who's asking?

22:17.254 --> 22:18.908
You know who we are.

22:20.432 --> 22:22.521
Someone wants to meet you.

22:24.436 --> 22:26.481
Let's go, let's go. Come on.

22:26.525 --> 22:28.527
We're wheels up in five.

22:29.919 --> 22:32.269
So, what part of the CIA

22:32.313 --> 22:34.054
are you with anyway,
Agent Burke?

22:34.097 --> 22:35.925
He's wet works.

22:35.969 --> 22:37.405
Ah.

22:37.449 --> 22:39.799
The real
off-the-books stuff, eh?

22:39.842 --> 22:42.410
Assassinations and the like.

22:42.454 --> 22:45.413
Officially, none of
your operations exist.

22:45.457 --> 22:48.416
Yes. But unofficially,
Burke's the best.

22:48.460 --> 22:50.244
He doesn't make mistakes.

22:50.287 --> 22:52.115
Which is why he's
still in business,

22:52.159 --> 22:54.857
even after all these years.

22:58.905 --> 23:01.777
This photo was taken in 2003,

23:01.821 --> 23:04.258
when this woman was
the lead physicist

23:04.301 --> 23:05.781
on the File 47 project.

23:05.825 --> 23:08.741
Of course, I didn't
know that at the time,

23:08.784 --> 23:10.743
when I took this photo...

23:10.786 --> 23:13.528
before your squad eliminated
all assets

23:13.572 --> 23:17.576
involved in working on File 47.

23:18.620 --> 23:20.448
You killed...

23:20.492 --> 23:21.928
DXS agents?

23:21.971 --> 23:24.931
Oh. More
than a few.

23:24.974 --> 23:26.454
Isn't that right, Burke?

23:26.498 --> 23:28.369
But this woman here...

23:28.413 --> 23:32.286
I believed that she had died
in a plane crash.

23:32.329 --> 23:35.420
Lately, I've been suspicious.

23:36.421 --> 23:39.467
And then I found this.

23:39.511 --> 23:41.251
That's her.

23:41.295 --> 23:43.297
A month ago in Italy.

23:46.518 --> 23:49.608
Looks like you missed one.

24:00.357 --> 24:02.882
Where the hell are we?

24:16.548 --> 24:18.201
Gwen.

24:18.245 --> 24:19.768
I thought you were...

24:19.812 --> 24:22.162
Alive and kicking.

24:23.685 --> 24:25.731
James, you really should see

24:25.774 --> 24:27.776
the look on your face right now.

24:28.777 --> 24:29.996
Angus.

24:32.564 --> 24:34.261
Finally.

24:35.654 --> 24:37.873
Welcome to Codex.

24:45.664 --> 24:47.666
So,
the CIA killed everyone a part

24:47.709 --> 24:48.362
of the old Phoenix... sorry...

24:48.405 --> 24:49.537
DXS project,

24:49.581 --> 24:51.147
but that person survived.

24:51.191 --> 24:52.627
How? Well,

24:52.671 --> 24:54.629
that's an excellent question.

24:54.673 --> 24:55.543
I'm guessing Codex

24:55.587 --> 24:56.805
stepped in.
Tell us,

24:56.849 --> 24:58.043
Burke, what'd they promise you?

24:58.067 --> 25:00.461
Power? Money? What?

25:02.028 --> 25:03.551
Money?

25:04.944 --> 25:06.772
That's so basic.

25:06.815 --> 25:09.775
Did you really think
that I would let you walk in here

25:09.818 --> 25:11.646
with the upper hand?

25:11.690 --> 25:13.343
Here's the deal.

25:13.387 --> 25:16.608
Either I tell Congress
about your kill squad,

25:16.651 --> 25:19.088
or I tell your boss
that your cleanup

25:19.132 --> 25:20.612
wasn't so clean.

25:26.443 --> 25:28.054
What do you want?

25:28.097 --> 25:29.751
If this woman disappeared,

25:29.795 --> 25:32.362
then you helped her
with a new identity.

25:32.406 --> 25:33.712
Help me find her.

25:37.498 --> 25:39.500
Stand down.
We're done here.

25:40.675 --> 25:42.503
Ta-ta, then.
See yourselves out, yeah?

25:42.547 --> 25:44.592
Just down there to the right.

25:44.636 --> 25:47.073
That intel I gave you...

25:47.116 --> 25:50.467
that's a can of worms you
can't possibly imagine.

25:50.511 --> 25:53.383
Don't underestimate my imagination.

25:57.474 --> 25:59.476
What the...?

25:59.520 --> 26:02.131
Where's Carter? Oh, uh,

26:02.175 --> 26:03.350
second floor.

26:03.393 --> 26:04.699
Supply closet.

26:08.224 --> 26:10.575
God, I hate this place.

26:14.317 --> 26:16.624
Look for any
information that you can find

26:16.668 --> 26:17.843
on this name.

26:17.886 --> 26:19.714
We lost Mac and Oversight.

26:19.758 --> 26:21.237
Mac thinks it's... Codex.

26:21.281 --> 26:22.412
He's right.

26:22.456 --> 26:24.023
You find this person,
we'll find them.

26:24.066 --> 26:26.634
So... who is she?

26:26.678 --> 26:30.072
Titan. Head of Codex.

26:30.116 --> 26:32.335
Her name is Gwendolyn Hayes.

26:32.379 --> 26:35.730
Brilliant astrophysicist
and former DXS agent.

26:35.774 --> 26:40.082
She was one of the chief
architects of File 47.

26:40.126 --> 26:41.649
I think it's time you tell us

26:41.693 --> 26:44.783
exactly what the hell
this File 47 is.

26:48.003 --> 26:49.657
Your last name is...

26:49.701 --> 26:51.050
Hayes? Yeah.

26:51.093 --> 26:53.792
Your mother's maiden name.

26:53.835 --> 26:56.838
I'm Auntie Gwen.

26:56.882 --> 26:58.666
I have an aunt?

26:58.710 --> 27:01.451
Had. I thought
she was dead.

27:01.495 --> 27:04.106
Well, guess I didn't make
the family album.

27:06.935 --> 27:09.982
I used to be
just like you, Angus.

27:11.026 --> 27:13.028
I worked for DXS.

27:14.551 --> 27:16.684
I was full of idealism.

27:16.728 --> 27:19.426
Eager to "build a better world."
Look, I don't know

27:19.469 --> 27:22.559
what you want,
but leave him out of it.

27:22.603 --> 27:23.822
Leave him out of it?

27:23.865 --> 27:25.780
James,
this is the family business.

27:25.824 --> 27:28.174
Sharing is caring.
You need to work

27:28.217 --> 27:29.262
on that.

27:29.305 --> 27:30.742
I had to set up
poor Mason over here

27:30.785 --> 27:32.395
just to get you
back in his life.

27:32.439 --> 27:34.180
You set me up? I did.

27:34.223 --> 27:36.008
I really did.

27:36.051 --> 27:38.619
Why?

27:38.663 --> 27:41.056
Because the world is on fire.

27:43.842 --> 27:46.888
The climate's changing, but none
of us want to change with it.

27:46.932 --> 27:50.196
As a species, we're devolving.

27:50.239 --> 27:52.720
We used to be...
intellectually curious,

27:52.764 --> 27:55.201
but now we choose ignorance.

27:55.244 --> 27:57.769
Gwen, don't.
Today we censor

27:57.812 --> 27:58.900
scientists.

27:58.944 --> 28:00.902
Nobody cares if an entire town's

28:00.946 --> 28:02.425
water supply is poisoned,

28:02.469 --> 28:04.210
but you take away
our same-day shipping,

28:04.253 --> 28:05.777
and, ooh...

28:05.820 --> 28:07.996
it's pitchforks and torches.

28:11.260 --> 28:13.219
James...

28:13.262 --> 28:16.135
did you tell your son

28:16.178 --> 28:18.398
about File 47?

28:22.141 --> 28:23.751
He didn't.

28:23.795 --> 28:26.101
'Cause the people
who know about it get killed.

28:26.145 --> 28:27.320
It was a thought experiment.

28:27.363 --> 28:28.930
An ambitious project

28:28.974 --> 28:30.845
started by some of us at DXS.

28:30.889 --> 28:32.934
While the rest of us thought
it was insane.

28:36.329 --> 28:37.330
Wait. What...

28:37.373 --> 28:38.461
Tell him.

28:38.505 --> 28:39.767
Go to hell.

28:39.811 --> 28:41.769
Okay, you see this?

28:41.813 --> 28:43.989
Irrational. Afraid.

28:44.032 --> 28:47.383
Holding on to ignorance despite
a gun pointed at his head.

28:47.427 --> 28:49.908
Knowing he's breathing his last
breaths, but he's so stubborn,

28:49.951 --> 28:52.388
he won't budge... that is us.

28:52.432 --> 28:54.695
That is the human race.

28:54.739 --> 28:56.262
Under the chin.

28:57.306 --> 28:58.873
No, come on.
Dad, just...

29:00.962 --> 29:03.965
47...

29:04.009 --> 29:06.228
is a hypothetical plan

29:06.272 --> 29:09.579
to initiate a series
of natural disasters

29:09.623 --> 29:12.147
that would plunge the world
into chaos.

29:12.191 --> 29:13.714
Destroy the fabric

29:13.758 --> 29:15.847
of modern society.
No.

29:15.890 --> 29:18.501
Destroy the shackles
of modern society.

29:19.502 --> 29:21.461
This is a reset switch.

29:21.504 --> 29:23.811
Get the world off oil,

29:23.855 --> 29:26.379
reverse the greenhouse effect...

29:26.422 --> 29:28.424
build a real future.

29:30.731 --> 29:33.386
Energy consumption.
Population growth.

29:33.429 --> 29:34.822
Food shortages.

29:34.866 --> 29:37.129
Refugee migration.

29:37.172 --> 29:39.261
Political upheaval.

29:39.305 --> 29:40.828
You're an engineer.

29:40.872 --> 29:42.264
Does this look sound to you?

29:43.788 --> 29:45.746
Angus.

29:48.880 --> 29:50.707
Or does this look
like a structure

29:50.751 --> 29:51.883
on the verge of collapse?

29:56.844 --> 29:58.193
Does this look like a world

29:58.237 --> 30:00.805
that is rising to the challenge?

30:04.983 --> 30:06.245
This...

30:06.288 --> 30:10.075
is the TED Talk from hell.

30:11.293 --> 30:13.861
I'd like to talk with Angus
privately.

30:17.822 --> 30:19.867
You hurt my son, I'll kill you.

30:19.911 --> 30:21.695
Dad, it's gonna be fine.

30:21.738 --> 30:23.958
James...

30:24.002 --> 30:25.612
I'm already dead.

30:37.972 --> 30:40.670
All right, I got a hit
on Gwendolyn's alias:

30:40.714 --> 30:42.368
Sharon White.

30:42.411 --> 30:43.848
There's a lot of activity here.

30:43.891 --> 30:47.677
Bank transfers, shell corps,
credit cards, donations.

30:47.721 --> 30:49.592
No address or place
of business, though.

30:50.942 --> 30:52.615
This is all buried beneath
a mountain of smoke.

30:52.639 --> 30:53.727
Do you have a location?

30:53.770 --> 30:54.946
Sure, Riley,

30:54.989 --> 30:57.035
just scour the global
communications grid

30:57.078 --> 30:59.254
for one person out of
seven and a half billion.

30:59.298 --> 31:01.169
No problem.

31:01.213 --> 31:03.998
Ah. Isn't she gorgeous?

31:04.042 --> 31:05.957
Truss-Dobsonian optical design.

31:06.000 --> 31:08.350
3.6 focal ratio.

31:08.394 --> 31:10.091
20-inch aperture.

31:10.135 --> 31:11.919
Come have a look.

31:13.965 --> 31:16.010
She's pointed at Icarus,

31:16.054 --> 31:18.970
the farthest star
known to science.

31:19.013 --> 31:21.450
You know the myth?

31:21.494 --> 31:24.801
Daedalus made wings out
of feathers and wax.

31:24.845 --> 31:27.456
He warned his son Icarus not
to fly too close to the sun.

31:27.500 --> 31:29.632
Icarus didn't listen and
melted his wings,

31:29.676 --> 31:32.374
and yada, yada, yada, scientists
have too much hubris,

31:32.418 --> 31:34.855
and we fly too high,
something like that?

31:34.899 --> 31:38.250
No, we're not Icarus.

31:38.293 --> 31:40.687
We're the gods.

31:40.730 --> 31:42.689
You and I, we can end this.

31:42.732 --> 31:45.953
No. Our responsibility

31:45.997 --> 31:48.956
is to contribute to the
progress of mankind.

31:49.000 --> 31:51.524
You sound just like your mother.

31:51.567 --> 31:54.092
And you have her eyes, too.

31:54.135 --> 31:56.659
Thanks, but I wouldn't know.

31:57.530 --> 32:00.185
Your mother worked for DXS.

32:00.228 --> 32:02.709
All of this started with her.

32:03.753 --> 32:07.061
File 47 was her idea.

32:09.629 --> 32:12.197
Okay, I got something here.

32:12.240 --> 32:14.025
I found a shell corp

32:14.068 --> 32:16.288
with a deed for a building
on a private island.

32:16.331 --> 32:18.005
Well, that could be where
they're keeping Mac

32:18.029 --> 32:19.397
and Oversight. Boze, tell the pilot

32:19.421 --> 32:21.597
to fuel up for Mexico.
Desi, you're with me.

32:26.298 --> 32:28.909
Okay, time's up.

32:28.953 --> 32:30.321
Let's go. Hold on a minute.

32:30.345 --> 32:31.738
I think there's something wrong.

32:31.781 --> 32:33.479
Oh, you think I'm an idiot?

32:33.522 --> 32:34.915
He's an old man.

32:34.959 --> 32:37.570
He got hit by shrapnel.
Have a little compassion.

32:47.275 --> 32:49.669
Old man, my ass.

32:49.712 --> 32:51.018
Let's go.

32:51.062 --> 32:53.020
No.

32:53.064 --> 32:55.022
I don't believe you.

32:55.066 --> 32:56.589
I don't believe that my mother

32:56.632 --> 32:58.045
would have wanted this
many people to die.

32:58.069 --> 32:59.418
Nobody wants people to die.

32:59.461 --> 33:01.463
I don't want people to die.

33:01.507 --> 33:02.725
Then stop trying to kill them.

33:02.769 --> 33:04.118
You're missing the big picture.

33:04.162 --> 33:06.120
Your mother saw it.

33:06.164 --> 33:08.514
She had the strength.
She knew what had to be done,

33:08.557 --> 33:10.820
and that's why they
hunted us down.

33:10.864 --> 33:12.866
What-what are... Who?

33:16.348 --> 33:18.306
The CIA.

33:18.350 --> 33:21.527
To them, File 47 was just a
blueprint for the apocalypse,

33:21.570 --> 33:24.791
so they came for us.

33:24.834 --> 33:26.271
Some were car accidents.

33:26.314 --> 33:27.576
Drownings.

33:27.620 --> 33:30.144
Mine was an airplane accident.

33:30.188 --> 33:32.364
I barely survived.

33:33.800 --> 33:37.847
But I was given a
new life by Codex.

33:37.891 --> 33:40.763
By terrorists.
Scientists.

33:40.807 --> 33:43.984
Who are willing to do
what needs to be done.

33:44.028 --> 33:46.378
And what is that?

33:46.421 --> 33:48.336
Save the world.

33:55.952 --> 33:57.128
Much as I loathe to say it,

33:57.171 --> 33:58.844
we're gonna need each other.
You got a plan?

33:58.868 --> 34:01.088
Uh, yeah. Let's shake things up.

34:01.132 --> 34:03.090
Do you think you can work
with these?

34:03.134 --> 34:05.005
Like riding a bicycle.

34:19.672 --> 34:21.021
Here's the ignition fob.

34:21.065 --> 34:22.717
Got it.

34:27.679 --> 34:29.985
Mason!

34:38.864 --> 34:41.128
Well, that wasn't smart.

34:41.172 --> 34:44.130
Trust me, it wasn't for you.
They still got Angus.

34:44.175 --> 34:46.264
You're not going anywhere.

34:50.005 --> 34:51.485
You took a bullet for me.

34:51.530 --> 34:53.053
I'll go get your kid.

35:01.453 --> 35:03.039
If we do nothing, everyone dies.

35:03.063 --> 35:05.848
If we act, yes,
we lose millions,

35:05.892 --> 35:07.894
but we save the rest.

35:09.113 --> 35:12.072
We've run out of time
to be heroes, Angus.

35:12.116 --> 35:13.595
We have to play God now.

35:13.639 --> 35:16.598
When you accept that,
the rest will be easier.

35:16.642 --> 35:17.991
Every cause has an effect,

35:18.034 --> 35:21.037
so be the butterfly.

35:21.081 --> 35:22.256
Flap your wings

35:22.300 --> 35:25.955
and let the hurricane begin.

35:33.572 --> 35:36.096
Angus, either you're with us
or you're against us.

35:36.140 --> 35:37.837
It's your choice.

35:37.880 --> 35:39.839
And I think we both know

35:39.882 --> 35:41.884
it's time for you to come home.

36:02.470 --> 36:05.430
A telescope like this
has enough magnification power

36:05.473 --> 36:06.996
that if pointed at the Sun,

36:07.040 --> 36:08.781
it could burn out your retina.

36:10.391 --> 36:12.654
But if pointed at the Moon,

36:12.698 --> 36:14.178
you get just enough light...

36:34.807 --> 36:36.678
Come on!

36:40.987 --> 36:42.467
Let's go!

36:46.210 --> 36:47.341
Dad.

36:52.216 --> 36:54.609
Angus, you g...
you got to know,

36:54.653 --> 36:56.568
your mother never...

36:56.611 --> 36:58.352
never wanted any of this.

36:58.396 --> 37:00.963
She-she was just doing her job.

37:01.007 --> 37:04.053
We got company.
Where's that ignition fob?

37:07.143 --> 37:08.580
It got hit

37:08.623 --> 37:10.625
when I did.

37:10.669 --> 37:12.584
All right, well,
we can drive out of here.

37:12.627 --> 37:15.302
Come on, let's go. Let's go!
No. No. No.
Son, they'll just chase us.

37:15.326 --> 37:18.024
Someone's got to slow them down.

37:18.067 --> 37:19.131
I'll set off the explosion.

37:19.155 --> 37:21.027
Manually.

37:21.070 --> 37:22.724
No.

37:22.768 --> 37:25.771
No. No, uh, I'll fix this.

37:25.814 --> 37:27.599
Look, uh, we can, uh, start over.

37:27.642 --> 37:29.296
It's day one, remember? Mm-mm.

37:29.340 --> 37:31.603
Hey, I can't stop them.

37:31.646 --> 37:33.213
You can.

37:33.257 --> 37:35.520
You're the invaluable asset,

37:35.563 --> 37:37.217
and you have to go.

37:38.349 --> 37:39.872
They're coming.

37:40.916 --> 37:42.918
Angus.

37:46.095 --> 37:47.880
I, uh...

37:47.923 --> 37:50.186
I love you, too, Dad.

37:57.193 --> 37:59.239
Come on, kid. Hey.

38:00.240 --> 38:02.895
Let's go. We got to go. Let's go.

38:34.796 --> 38:35.884
All right.

38:35.928 --> 38:37.364
You got me.

38:37.408 --> 38:40.236
Now you're
probably gonna want to run.

38:51.509 --> 38:52.684
Just in time.

38:52.727 --> 38:55.251
We're leaving. Initiate
Clean Sweep protocol.

38:55.295 --> 38:57.819
Copy. Titan has
initiated Clean Sweep.

38:57.863 --> 38:59.865
Fall back to Site B.

39:05.044 --> 39:06.785
Mason.

39:10.658 --> 39:13.182
Up here, I'm going one way,
and you're going the other.

39:13.226 --> 39:15.141
You got a problem with that?

39:15.184 --> 39:16.969
No.

39:17.012 --> 39:19.580
But the next time I see you,
I promise you,

39:19.624 --> 39:22.235
the answer will not be the same.

39:22.278 --> 39:25.543
I'm sorry about your father.

39:25.586 --> 39:27.806
I'm sorry about your son.

39:30.504 --> 39:33.464
Hope you get those bastards.

39:53.309 --> 39:54.702
Mac?

39:54.746 --> 39:56.269
Mac!
Uh, yeah.

40:02.014 --> 40:03.972
Was that you?

40:04.016 --> 40:07.280
No. It was them
covering their tracks.

40:07.323 --> 40:09.456
Where's Oversight?

40:10.501 --> 40:12.764
He, uh...

40:33.654 --> 40:36.135
We should go.

40:44.186 --> 40:47.712
So, you knew it was her
the whole time?

40:47.755 --> 40:50.062
No. I didn't know for sure.

40:50.105 --> 40:52.673
But after what Bishop
said to you,

40:52.717 --> 40:54.762
some of their
operating procedures,

40:54.806 --> 40:57.809
patterns that Taylor
was seeing, I...

40:57.852 --> 41:01.465
It all started to feel familiar.

41:01.508 --> 41:02.553
Why didn't you tell me?

41:02.596 --> 41:03.989
Because of what it meant.

41:04.032 --> 41:07.122
For you, for your father.

41:07.166 --> 41:09.734
I wanted to know for sure.

41:09.777 --> 41:11.431
So what now?

41:11.475 --> 41:13.389
She's still out there.

41:15.087 --> 41:16.871
We find her.

41:16.915 --> 41:18.351
And we stop them

41:18.394 --> 41:19.787
from doing more harm.

41:24.792 --> 41:27.403
This was an incredible
loss for you.

41:29.014 --> 41:30.842
You should take some time.

41:30.885 --> 41:33.584
As much time as you need,
Mac. We'll be here.

41:33.627 --> 41:34.759
I don't need time.

41:34.802 --> 41:36.195
The last thing

41:36.238 --> 41:38.850
my father said to me
was that he couldn't stop them

41:38.893 --> 41:40.634
but that I could.

41:42.027 --> 41:44.029
So that's what I'm gonna do.

41:46.074 --> 41:48.033
Mac. I'll see you tomorrow.

41:48.076 --> 41:49.904
Back to work.
