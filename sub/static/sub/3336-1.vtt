00:51.298 --> 00:53.459
First time giving blood?

00:55.035 --> 00:56.969
Yes.

00:58.204 --> 01:00.138
They pay cash here.

01:00.206 --> 01:02.800
And there's no limit
to how many times you give.

01:02.876 --> 01:04.935
They even buy it
in the jar.

01:05.010 --> 01:08.139
Jared Nomak,
we're ready for you.

01:21.361 --> 01:24.387
In the past 1 2 months,
have you gotten a tattoo,

01:24.464 --> 01:27.399
or undergone any ear,
skin, or body piercings?

01:27.467 --> 01:28.934
No.

01:29.002 --> 01:31.436
Where did you get
that scar on your chin?

01:32.672 --> 01:34.640
Childhood accident.

01:34.708 --> 01:37.677
You say you don't have
any immediate next of kin,

01:37.744 --> 01:40.269
- is that right?
- Not that I'm in contact with.

01:40.347 --> 01:42.440
Nobody to call in case
of an emergency?

01:42.515 --> 01:44.107
No one.

01:44.184 --> 01:46.778
- No family?
- I told you, no.

01:46.853 --> 01:51.187
Are you telling me
I can't be a donor?

01:51.257 --> 01:53.555
It depends.
We came up

01:53.627 --> 01:55.618
with some unusual results
on your blood test.

01:55.695 --> 01:57.629
What?

01:57.697 --> 01:59.631
How unusual?

02:00.867 --> 02:02.732
Let me explain.

02:02.802 --> 02:05.566
Your blood has
a very rare phenotype,

02:05.639 --> 02:08.005
one we haven't
encountered before.

02:10.543 --> 02:14.377
What? What are you
talking about?

02:14.447 --> 02:17.883
- Who are you? No.
- Sit down, please.

02:20.053 --> 02:21.577
What is this?

02:21.655 --> 02:26.456
This is a good news-bad news
scenario, Jared.

02:26.526 --> 02:28.289
Good news for us...

02:30.397 --> 02:32.490
bad news...

02:34.234 --> 02:36.498
...for you.

03:39.566 --> 03:42.160
Forget what you think
you know--

03:42.235 --> 03:44.999
vampires exist.

03:47.741 --> 03:51.177
My name is Blade.

03:51.244 --> 03:54.907
I was born half human,
half vampire.

03:56.416 --> 04:00.113
They call me
''The Daywalker.''

04:02.188 --> 04:04.452
I have all their strengths,

04:04.524 --> 04:07.288
none of their weaknesses.

04:07.360 --> 04:09.885
Except for the thirst.

04:11.197 --> 04:14.462
20 years ago I met a man
that changed that.

04:14.534 --> 04:17.935
Whistler.

04:18.004 --> 04:20.802
He taught me how to hold
the thirst at bay.

04:20.874 --> 04:23.308
Taught me the rules.

04:23.376 --> 04:25.970
Gave me the weapons
to hunt with.

04:26.045 --> 04:29.606
Silver, garlic,

04:29.682 --> 04:31.809
sunlight.

04:31.885 --> 04:34.479
Two years ago
he was attacked.

04:34.554 --> 04:36.146
They took him,

04:36.222 --> 04:39.555
and turned him into
the thing I hate most.

04:41.394 --> 04:43.988
I should have
finished him off.

04:44.063 --> 04:46.258
Now I'm hunting him.

04:49.602 --> 04:51.536
I will find him.

04:51.604 --> 04:54.937
And nothing will stand
in my way.

05:18.031 --> 05:19.965
Daywalker's here!
Stop him!

05:33.847 --> 05:35.872
Where is he?

06:20.193 --> 06:21.956
Hey!

08:13.840 --> 08:15.364
No, no.

08:21.514 --> 08:25.780
Take me to him, and I'll
consider you a loose end.

10:47.426 --> 10:49.792
Catch you later.

11:27.567 --> 11:32.004
Old man... look at what
they've done to you.

12:25.725 --> 12:27.886
Let's go home.

13:15.608 --> 13:17.439
Lock up your daughters,
boys and girls,

13:17.510 --> 13:20.240
the dark knight returns.

13:24.550 --> 13:27.280
- Need a toke of the smokage, B?
- Later.

13:27.353 --> 13:29.514
Cut the lights.

13:35.127 --> 13:36.822
You found him.

13:40.433 --> 13:43.334
You didn't kill him.

13:43.402 --> 13:47.065
Give me a hand.

13:50.076 --> 13:52.169
I got a bad feeling
about this, B.

13:53.879 --> 13:57.508
Listen to his breathing.
He's already dying. He's in pain.

13:57.583 --> 13:59.517
Why don't you just put him
out of his misery right now?

13:59.585 --> 14:01.712
They had him on stasis
in a halfway house.

14:01.787 --> 14:05.621
I' m giving hi m an accelerated
retr-viral det x.

14:05.691 --> 14:08.956
Like a heroin addict.

14:09.028 --> 14:10.996
Make him go cold turkey
in one night.

14:11.063 --> 14:12.826
Shit ain't
going to work, man.

14:12.898 --> 14:14.991
I say y u kill the m therfucker
right nw.

14:15.067 --> 14:16.830
Get out.

14:25.845 --> 14:29.144
If there's anything left
of you in there, Whistler,

14:29.215 --> 14:31.615
listen up.

14:31.684 --> 14:35.620
In the morning those blinds
are going to open

14:35.688 --> 14:37.815
whether you're cured...

14:37.890 --> 14:39.824
or not.

14:51.737 --> 14:54.001
Hey, man,
I didn't mean to call him--

15:32.578 --> 15:36.446
Listen to me, Blade.

15:36.515 --> 15:39.075
You're going to have
to finish me off.

15:39.151 --> 15:40.550
No.

15:40.619 --> 15:44.077
Give me
that damn gun.

15:50.863 --> 15:52.387
Now walk away.

15:52.465 --> 15:55.059
Stubborn son of a bitch.

16:46.352 --> 16:48.786
How do you feel?

16:53.559 --> 16:55.959
Like hammered shit.

16:59.832 --> 17:01.766
How'd you find me?

17:01.834 --> 17:06.099
I started out in Moscow.
Then Romania.

17:06.171 --> 17:11.131
- They kept moving you around.
- How long was I gone?

17:13.178 --> 17:17.046
- Months?
- Too long.

17:23.122 --> 17:25.282
Years.

17:27.859 --> 17:30.158
They tortured me
almost to death.

17:30.229 --> 17:33.289
And then let me heal
in a vat of blood

17:33.365 --> 17:36.266
so they could go
at it again.

17:38.370 --> 17:40.463
Sorry sons of bitches
could have at least

17:40.539 --> 17:42.803
fixed my goddamn leg
while they were at it.

17:45.978 --> 17:48.538
Where's my arc welder?

18:03.596 --> 18:06.588
What's up? Nice to meet you.
I heard a lot about you.

18:06.665 --> 18:10.101
I'm Josh. You can call me ''Scud.''
Everybody does.

18:21.680 --> 18:23.944
Tell me something, Skid--

18:24.016 --> 18:26.382
No, man, it's ''Scud,''
like ''Stud.''

18:26.452 --> 18:28.113
Whatever.

18:28.187 --> 18:31.213
- What are you doing here?
- The pimpmobile?

18:31.290 --> 18:33.815
Just a little aftermarket
modification.

18:33.892 --> 18:35.291
- Nitrous oxide and shit like that.
- Oh, yeah.

18:35.361 --> 18:37.955
You gave it a more aggressive
exhaust profile ramping.

18:38.030 --> 18:41.227
The whole package will crank
that Betty up, maybe 300 horsepower.

18:41.300 --> 18:44.463
You'll burn the thing out
before your next oil change.

18:44.536 --> 18:47.403
Where did you dig up
this shitbird, anyway?

18:47.473 --> 18:49.304
What the fuck
is your problem, Poppy?

18:49.375 --> 18:52.503
My problem is I've been
sucking blood clots for two years.

18:52.578 --> 18:56.036
I get out to find some jerkoff
fucking with my life's work.

18:56.115 --> 18:58.481
We jeopardized our whole
operation to save your ass!

18:58.550 --> 19:00.017
- Our operation?
- Yeah.

19:00.085 --> 19:04.044
Our operation? I built
this operation, you ass-wipe!

19:07.259 --> 19:10.228
Motion sensors!
It's on three, gentlemen.

19:10.295 --> 19:12.160
Human?

19:12.231 --> 19:15.928
Body temperature, 50.
I'd guess suckhead.

19:22.708 --> 19:25.268
Fried. They're using
magnesium flares.

19:25.344 --> 19:28.472
They've got your security
system scoped out.

19:30.115 --> 19:32.606
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
I don't trust you--

20:16.695 --> 20:18.890
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

20:18.964 --> 20:20.329
Cool outfit.

20:28.006 --> 20:29.837
Guard lights!

22:27.526 --> 22:30.188
We represent the ruling body
of the Vampire Nation.

22:31.463 --> 22:33.556
They are offering you
a truce.

22:33.632 --> 22:36.328
They want to meet
with you.

22:39.905 --> 22:41.668
Scud.

22:43.876 --> 22:46.344
Take off your mask.

22:51.750 --> 22:55.652
My name is Asad.
This is Nyssa.

22:59.091 --> 23:01.616
You have been our most
feared enemy.

23:01.693 --> 23:05.185
But now there's something else
loose on the streets.

23:05.264 --> 23:07.824
Something worse
than you.

23:22.714 --> 23:24.648
What's so funny?

23:24.716 --> 23:28.413
They tell stories about Blade
as the Bogeyman.

23:28.487 --> 23:30.318
Frankly,
I'm disappointed.

23:30.389 --> 23:34.655
You hear that, B?
She's disappointed.

23:34.726 --> 23:38.184
He agreed
to come along so easily.

23:38.263 --> 23:41.994
Come on, B, show her.
Pretty please?

23:44.369 --> 23:46.860
Semtex.

23:48.573 --> 23:51.007
Enough explosives
to level a city block.

23:53.378 --> 23:55.505
You still disappointed?

24:17.703 --> 24:20.638
The guards look human.
They're probably familiars.

24:38.890 --> 24:40.983
You sure about this?

24:41.059 --> 24:43.493
Well, if I'm not...

24:55.073 --> 24:57.871
The true power
of the Vampire Nation lies here.

25:10.022 --> 25:11.512
Father?

25:18.864 --> 25:23.130
Blade, this is
Overlord Eli Damaskinos.

25:27.839 --> 25:30.603
It has been said,
''Be proud of your enemy

25:30.675 --> 25:32.802
and enjoy his success.''

25:32.878 --> 25:35.904
In that regard,
I should thank you.

25:35.981 --> 25:38.814
- For what?
- Eliminating Deacon Frost.

25:38.884 --> 25:42.149
You did us a favor.
Karel Kounen.

25:44.790 --> 25:47.190
- You're human.
- Barely. I'm a lawyer.

25:47.259 --> 25:49.489
European Health Consortium.

25:49.561 --> 25:52.894
As you may know,
Vampirism is...

25:52.964 --> 25:58.163
a horrible virus, carried
in the saliva of predators.

25:58.236 --> 26:02.229
In 7 2 hours, it spreads through
the human bloodstream,

26:02.307 --> 26:05.765
creating new
parasitic organs.

26:05.844 --> 26:07.505
Like cancer.

26:09.347 --> 26:12.714
Cancer with a purpose.

26:14.252 --> 26:16.948
Unfortunately,
viruses evolve, too.

26:17.022 --> 26:19.115
We've encountered
a new one.

26:19.191 --> 26:21.056
We dubbed it
the Reaper Strain.

26:21.126 --> 26:25.563
And like any good pathogen,
it appears to have found a carrier.

26:33.672 --> 26:35.367
There...
Jared Nomak.

26:35.440 --> 26:39.900
Born a vampire,
but an anomaly like you.

26:41.379 --> 26:43.574
Unlike the rest of us,
however,

26:43.648 --> 26:46.515
he feeds on not just humans,

26:46.585 --> 26:49.554
but vampires as well.

26:49.621 --> 26:53.489
- Looks like he was doing me a favor.
- You're missing the point.

26:53.558 --> 26:55.583
Their vampire victims
don't die...

26:55.660 --> 26:59.494
they turn.
They become carriers.

26:59.564 --> 27:02.590
You've got to understand.
These things are like crack addicts.

27:02.667 --> 27:07.434
They need to feed daily.
Nomak's been up for 7 2 hours.

27:07.506 --> 27:11.272
By our estimates, there are already
a dozen Reapers.

27:11.343 --> 27:13.834
There'll be hundreds
before the week is out.

27:13.912 --> 27:17.939
Thousands within a matter of months.
Do the math.

27:18.016 --> 27:19.950
Wait. Let me get
this right.

27:20.018 --> 27:24.216
You want me
to hunt them... for you?

27:24.289 --> 27:25.620
When they are finished
with us,

27:25.690 --> 27:28.955
who do you think
they'll turn on next?

27:29.027 --> 27:31.723
Your precious humans.

27:31.796 --> 27:35.630
Not one of them
will be left.

27:35.700 --> 27:38.464
We spent two years training
a small tactical unit--

27:38.537 --> 27:41.233
The Bloodpack.
We want you to lead them.

27:41.306 --> 27:43.331
Two years?

27:44.709 --> 27:46.870
We've been training
to hunt you.

27:50.382 --> 27:52.316
So, B-man,
what do you think?

27:52.384 --> 27:54.648
Sounds like a plan.

27:54.719 --> 27:56.710
What do you really think?

27:56.788 --> 27:59.655
They're going to fuck us
the first chance they get.

28:01.226 --> 28:04.252
So, we ain't
gonna do this, right?

28:04.329 --> 28:06.263
We'll play along for now.

28:06.331 --> 28:09.266
They'll take us in deeper
than we've ever been.

28:09.334 --> 28:12.269
Get a chance to see
how their world really ticks.

28:12.337 --> 28:14.771
I had enough of their world.

28:14.839 --> 28:16.773
They're just shitting bricks

28:16.841 --> 28:19.935
because they're no longer
top of the food chain.

28:20.011 --> 28:23.777
Damn, man,
I'm really worried about him.

28:23.848 --> 28:25.782
I know he's
your friend and all,

28:25.850 --> 28:28.114
but I think you should
watch him.

28:28.186 --> 28:32.623
Nobody goes cold turkey
from the thirst in just one night.

29:14.666 --> 29:16.258
Looking to get
hooked up?

29:16.334 --> 29:18.768
Maybe.
What do you have?

29:18.837 --> 29:20.429
No problem.

29:20.505 --> 29:24.965
Horse, Hawaiian Ice,
whatever you need.

29:25.043 --> 29:27.773
Whatever I need.

29:27.846 --> 29:31.646
I like that.
What if I need you?

29:46.364 --> 29:48.525
So, so sweet.

30:25.103 --> 30:28.197
They are ready
whenever you are, Daywalker.

30:41.753 --> 30:44.654
Blade,
meet The Bloodpack.

30:46.257 --> 30:50.023
Lighthammer,
Verlaine,

30:50.095 --> 30:53.963
Priest,
Snowman,

30:54.032 --> 30:56.796
Chupa,
and Reinhardt.

31:10.548 --> 31:12.482
Hey, um...

31:12.550 --> 31:14.916
me and the gang
were wondering...

31:17.889 --> 31:20.483
What was that?

31:20.558 --> 31:23.493
Can you blush?

31:23.561 --> 31:26.052
Here we go.

31:28.967 --> 31:31.333
Oh, I get it.

31:31.403 --> 31:33.234
I see now.

31:33.304 --> 31:37.001
You've been training for two years
to take me out.

31:37.075 --> 31:39.771
And now, here I am.

31:39.844 --> 31:43.644
Ooh, so exciting,
isn't it?

31:43.715 --> 31:46.548
Okay, here's your chance.

31:48.019 --> 31:51.887
Come on.
What are you waiting for?

31:51.956 --> 31:53.821
Here I am.
Right here in front of you.

31:53.892 --> 31:56.486
Adolf here gets the first shot.
Come on.

31:56.561 --> 31:59.655
What are you looking at her for?
You need permission?

31:59.731 --> 32:01.892
Maybe you need
a little bit of incentive.

32:01.966 --> 32:03.934
Okay, I can help
with that.

32:06.204 --> 32:08.263
What's the matter?
Missed that?

32:08.339 --> 32:10.068
It's okay,
I can do it again.

32:13.711 --> 32:16.441
Come on.
What, do you need a manual?

32:16.514 --> 32:18.175
- Do it!
- Kill the bastard!

32:26.057 --> 32:29.891
Now you've got an explosive device
stuck to the back of your head.

32:29.961 --> 32:33.897
Silver nitrate. Rigged to go off
if anybody tampers with it.

32:33.965 --> 32:36.160
I'll have
the detonator with me.

32:36.234 --> 32:40.136
And you-- if you so much
as look at me wrong--

32:43.775 --> 32:46.539
From now on
we work as a unit.

32:46.611 --> 32:49.671
You'll be taking
orders from me.

32:51.182 --> 32:53.343
Any questions?

32:58.923 --> 33:00.686
Good.

33:03.294 --> 33:06.695
You want to catch the hunter?
You start with the prey.

33:06.764 --> 33:12.862
We'll target all the night places
where vampires congregate.

33:12.937 --> 33:14.564
Blood banks, safe houses.

33:14.639 --> 33:17.130
The bigger the better.

33:17.208 --> 33:20.974
So... what's first?

33:24.382 --> 33:26.612
The House of Pain.

33:39.230 --> 33:42.495
Where's the entrance?

33:42.567 --> 33:44.091
I don't see any signs.

33:44.168 --> 33:46.659
No vampire glyphs.

33:46.738 --> 33:50.504
No, because of you,
we've had to rethink our habits,

33:50.575 --> 33:53.169
tighten our security.

33:54.746 --> 33:56.805
Have a closer look.

34:03.888 --> 34:06.083
Nice.

34:06.157 --> 34:07.954
.38, .45
and 9mm caliber.

34:08.025 --> 34:10.460
All with foil capsules
at the tip

34:10.527 --> 34:12.621
filled with silver nitrate,
and garlic extract.

34:12.697 --> 34:14.790
This hyper-velocity
stake gun

34:14.866 --> 34:18.199
spits out a silver stake
at 6,000 feet per second.

34:18.268 --> 34:20.533
Since you suckers
don't like sunlight,

34:20.605 --> 34:24.405
we've modified the gun's
entry light with a UV filter.

34:24.475 --> 34:27.239
Pop it open--
instant UV light.

34:29.013 --> 34:30.981
Filter's on,
no problem.

34:31.049 --> 34:32.676
Yo, B, check this out.

34:32.750 --> 34:35.014
It's got an pneumatic
syringe delivery system.

34:35.085 --> 34:37.918
The vials are filled with
an anti-coagulant called EDTA.

34:37.989 --> 34:41.186
One punch with this, you'll blow
your target up like a balloon.

34:41.259 --> 34:44.126
The cartridge ejects.
Automatic reload.

34:44.195 --> 34:46.094
Nice.

34:47.398 --> 34:50.993
- Let's go.
- You won't pass for one of us.

34:51.069 --> 34:55.005
- Like I give a shit.
- No, he's right.

34:55.072 --> 34:57.337
Why don't you post up
on the roof over there?

34:57.408 --> 34:59.876
Cover our backs.

34:59.944 --> 35:04.040
So the Bloodpack's calling
the shots now, huh?

35:04.115 --> 35:06.276
Great.

35:08.186 --> 35:11.587
Better curb that dog of yours
or we'll do it for you.

35:15.159 --> 35:17.389
Keep pushing, asshole.

35:34.278 --> 35:36.143
? I ya, I against I ?

35:36.214 --> 35:38.648
? Flesh of my flesh
and mind of my mind ?

35:38.716 --> 35:40.809
? Two of a kind,
but one won't survive ?

35:40.885 --> 35:43.319
? My images reflect
in the enemy's eye ?

35:43.388 --> 35:46.152
? And his images reflect
in mine the same time ?

35:46.224 --> 35:48.317
? I ya, I ya, I against I ?

35:48.393 --> 35:51.260
? Flesh of my flesh
and mind of my mind ?

35:51.329 --> 35:53.490
? Two of a kind,
but one won't survive ?

35:53.564 --> 35:55.498
? Survive, survive,
survive. ?

36:01.673 --> 36:03.607
We're in.

36:11.349 --> 36:13.943
You're about
to enter our world.

36:14.018 --> 36:17.112
You will see things--
feeding.

36:17.188 --> 36:19.986
Just remember
why you're here.

36:20.058 --> 36:22.253
I haven't forgotten.

36:35.206 --> 36:37.640
What exactly
are we looking for in here?

36:37.709 --> 36:40.735
Anything that looks
suspicious.

36:47.552 --> 36:50.077
You got to be
kidding me.

37:43.608 --> 37:46.338
Scud, do you read me?

37:49.213 --> 37:52.808
- Scud, you reading me?
- Reading you loud and clear.

37:52.884 --> 37:54.818
The whole place
is a safe house.

37:54.886 --> 37:57.320
The windows are painted black,
one access door.

37:57.388 --> 38:01.757
- 200, 300 suckheads in here.
- That sounds cool.

38:01.826 --> 38:04.158
Hey, W, you got me?

38:06.330 --> 38:08.264
W?

38:11.502 --> 38:14.335
Tell me something,
how's the weather up there?

38:14.405 --> 38:18.273
Walkin' on sunshine,
toad boy.

38:23.648 --> 38:25.946
Look at them.
Half of these bastards,

38:26.017 --> 38:28.781
they're not even
pure bloods.

38:28.853 --> 38:33.517
I tell you what, why don't we
just fucking kill everyone?

38:33.591 --> 38:35.286
Just to make sure.

38:39.497 --> 38:41.795
God, it would be
so easy.

38:58.382 --> 39:00.646
He's got you.

39:30.581 --> 39:33.243
Daywalker.

40:47.591 --> 40:49.684
Mother's milk.

40:49.760 --> 40:53.355
I say we got about half an hour
till sunrise, Cinderella.

40:53.431 --> 40:54.989
Hurry up.

41:12.783 --> 41:14.546
I spotted one,
but lost it.

41:14.618 --> 41:16.745
Be on the lookout.

41:25.896 --> 41:27.659
Fuck.

42:55.419 --> 42:57.853
Whistler, they're
on the roof.

42:57.922 --> 42:59.651
I got them on the roof
of my bus.

43:24.014 --> 43:25.948
Shhh.

44:26.710 --> 44:29.076
Nomak.

44:29.146 --> 44:31.774
Daywalker.

44:31.849 --> 44:34.647
What am I to you?

44:34.718 --> 44:37.744
Is the enemy
of my enemy my friend...

44:37.821 --> 44:39.914
or my enemy?

44:58.709 --> 45:00.006
We're under attack!

45:00.077 --> 45:01.942
There's three of them.
Probably more.

45:12.022 --> 45:13.614
Daylight.

46:57.561 --> 47:00.052
Silver don't do jack shit.
Don't waste the bullets!

47:00.130 --> 47:03.657
- Motherfucker.
- You hear me, Chupa?

47:03.734 --> 47:05.429
Say, ''cheese.''

47:22.653 --> 47:24.587
Come on.

48:03.327 --> 48:05.261
How about some daylight,
motherfucker?

50:01.712 --> 50:03.646
Fuck!

51:01.138 --> 51:04.266
Listen to me. If you're under attack,
use your UV lights.

51:04.341 --> 51:06.707
Use your UV lights.
They can't take the light.

51:55.926 --> 51:59.157
Priest?
We're not dying here.

51:59.229 --> 52:02.596
- Come on.
- Priest is down.

52:07.204 --> 52:10.571
Daylight's coming.
You're on your own, Blade.

52:34.598 --> 52:37.761
You want me so bad, Blade?

52:37.834 --> 52:39.927
Here I am.

52:42.472 --> 52:44.872
Why kill me?

52:47.010 --> 52:50.343
You and I,
we have the same enemy.

52:50.414 --> 52:52.075
We want the same thing.

54:30.914 --> 54:32.973
We need the same thing,
Blade.

55:25.702 --> 55:27.294
What happened?

55:27.370 --> 55:29.304
Why didn't you tell me
these things

55:29.372 --> 55:32.466
- were immune to silver and garlic?
- I didn't know.

55:32.542 --> 55:35.067
If you did,
would you have told me?

55:36.213 --> 55:39.239
I think you know the truth
when you hear it.

55:39.316 --> 55:41.511
Mm-hmm.
Then why didn't he kill you?

55:47.891 --> 55:49.825
How long since
he's been bitten?

55:49.893 --> 55:52.987
- About 20 minutes.
- His skin is fucking burning.

55:53.063 --> 55:55.190
He's already starting
to change.

55:58.235 --> 56:01.102
Will someone just
shut him the fuck up?

56:20.023 --> 56:21.888
Hold on!

56:21.958 --> 56:24.483
- Hold him, Chupa!
- Come on, man!

56:24.561 --> 56:26.358
Put him
out of his fucking misery!

56:28.064 --> 56:30.498
Don't you get it?
You can't finish him that way!

56:30.567 --> 56:33.127
Hold him down!
Hold him down, Chupa!

56:37.207 --> 56:38.640
Move.

56:42.646 --> 56:44.477
Back off!

56:57.394 --> 56:59.828
If that was
your Bloodpack Sunday punch,

56:59.896 --> 57:02.763
- we're in trouble.
- This motherfucker left his post.

57:02.832 --> 57:05.665
- He just disappeared.
- Where were you?

57:05.735 --> 57:07.828
Ran into a little Reaper
action myself.

57:07.904 --> 57:10.168
Oh, yeah?
How little?

57:10.240 --> 57:11.935
We lost a man.
Priest.

57:12.008 --> 57:15.273
You want me to carve
his name on your chest?

57:17.347 --> 57:18.439
Let me show you.

57:27.023 --> 57:29.457
Saw him moving in the alley
and followed it down.

57:29.526 --> 57:31.118
Found it just like this.

57:31.194 --> 57:33.628
I think they came through here.

57:33.697 --> 57:35.790
It was trying to crawl back
in the culvert.

57:35.865 --> 57:37.457
Caught his arm.

57:38.101 --> 57:40.797
Been gnawing at it
like a coyote.

57:42.872 --> 57:44.806
Little Boy Blue.

57:46.409 --> 57:48.468
It's already dying.

57:48.545 --> 57:51.309
I need to examine it
as quickly as possible.

57:52.882 --> 57:55.476
Okay, look for a lever.
Let's open it.

58:15.839 --> 58:18.933
They've made contact
with the Reapers.

58:19.009 --> 58:22.672
- Any casualties?
- One so far.

58:22.746 --> 58:24.941
It was not...

58:25.015 --> 58:27.279
Nyssa, I trust?

58:28.418 --> 58:29.476
No.

58:31.187 --> 58:34.088
This a dangerous game
you're playing, Damaskinos.

58:34.157 --> 58:36.125
Blade is too volatile.

58:36.192 --> 58:38.956
You're not going to be able
to keep manipulating him.

58:39.029 --> 58:40.656
You worry too much.

58:40.730 --> 58:43.130
I've been informed
by our friend inside

58:43.199 --> 58:45.360
that events are unfolding
as scripted.

58:45.435 --> 58:47.403
You've already lost
one of your own.

58:47.470 --> 58:49.529
How many more are you
willing to sacrifice?

58:51.875 --> 58:53.467
Everyone.

58:53.543 --> 58:55.101
Even your own
daughter?

58:58.948 --> 59:01.746
Yes. Even her.

59:10.894 --> 59:12.828
Recognize this?

59:12.929 --> 59:14.453
The blood bank.

59:14.497 --> 59:16.260
He's one of the guards.

59:16.332 --> 59:18.698
So why is he dying?
What's killing him?

59:19.903 --> 59:21.837
Time.

59:21.905 --> 59:24.100
His metabolism
is burning too fast.

59:25.375 --> 59:27.775
They need fresh blood
every couple of hours,

59:27.844 --> 59:30.608
or they'll start feeding
on themselves.

59:30.680 --> 59:32.614
Nomak's different.

59:32.682 --> 59:35.913
He's the carrier.
It all started with him.

59:35.985 --> 59:37.612
It'll end with him.

01:00:02.378 --> 01:00:04.642
Open the mouth, Scud.

01:00:06.049 --> 01:00:08.313
Open the mouth.

01:00:08.384 --> 01:00:09.874
B, come on.

01:00:10.854 --> 01:00:12.651
Sissy.

01:00:29.072 --> 01:00:31.666
Only the tongue
carries the virus.

01:00:31.741 --> 01:00:34.335
It is injected
through these barbs.

01:00:36.579 --> 01:00:39.207
It has bifurcated
masseter muscles.

01:00:39.282 --> 01:00:42.547
Overdeveloped, allowing
for a much stronger bite.

01:00:44.721 --> 01:00:46.848
The jaw structure
remains the same.

01:00:46.923 --> 01:00:50.017
But there's
no mandible bone.

01:00:50.093 --> 01:00:51.993
Squeeze that tooth.

01:01:03.373 --> 01:01:05.307
Neurotoxin.

01:01:05.375 --> 01:01:07.104
Probably paralyzes
their victim

01:01:07.177 --> 01:01:08.405
while they feed.

01:01:12.215 --> 01:01:15.309
Garlic don't work.
Silver, that don't work.

01:01:15.385 --> 01:01:17.148
We got to go
with the sunlight, right?

01:01:17.220 --> 01:01:19.484
That's deadly to us, too.

01:01:19.556 --> 01:01:21.990
So let's see what else
we can find.

01:01:48.251 --> 01:01:50.617
These things are
as different from us

01:01:50.687 --> 01:01:53.178
as we are from you.

01:01:58.494 --> 01:02:00.291
Look at that.

01:02:00.363 --> 01:02:02.126
The heart
is encased in bone.

01:02:02.198 --> 01:02:04.462
Only the side
is vulnerable.

01:02:04.534 --> 01:02:06.627
Good luck getting
a stake through that.

01:02:06.703 --> 01:02:09.763
Pull a leg off a spider,
it keeps moving on its own,

01:02:09.839 --> 01:02:12.808
essentially trying to walk
without a body attached to it.

01:02:14.110 --> 01:02:16.635
- What are you doing?
- Hard-wired, right?

01:02:22.418 --> 01:02:24.352
What the fuck is that?

01:02:25.788 --> 01:02:28.018
Brain's dead.

01:02:28.091 --> 01:02:29.524
Body's still trying
to feed.

01:02:30.927 --> 01:02:33.487
We got six hours
before sunrise.

01:02:33.563 --> 01:02:35.121
Be ready by then.

01:02:35.198 --> 01:02:37.325
Hey...

01:02:37.400 --> 01:02:39.334
What happens
at sunrise?

01:02:41.504 --> 01:02:43.165
Blade,
I'm talking to you.

01:02:43.239 --> 01:02:45.173
What happens
at sunrise?

01:02:46.409 --> 01:02:49.276
- We hunt.
- In broad daylight?

01:02:49.345 --> 01:02:51.438
You got be joking.

01:02:51.514 --> 01:02:54.108
You better get you
some sunscreen, buttercup.

01:02:54.183 --> 01:02:55.377
Listen, shitkicker.

01:02:55.451 --> 01:02:58.215
You're about one cunt hair
away from hillbilly heaven.

01:02:58.288 --> 01:03:00.848
I love it
when you talk dirty.

01:03:04.193 --> 01:03:06.354
Sunlight's the only
edge we've got.

01:03:06.429 --> 01:03:09.455
- They'll be more vulnerable then.
- And so will we.

01:03:11.534 --> 01:03:13.468
Let's be real
about one thing--

01:03:14.871 --> 01:03:17.499
I don't expect everybody
to make it back tomorrow.

01:03:18.941 --> 01:03:21.102
Remember to protect
yourselves...

01:03:21.177 --> 01:03:23.145
at all times.

01:03:30.887 --> 01:03:32.411
What are you looking for?

01:03:32.488 --> 01:03:34.479
Phosphor rods.

01:03:34.557 --> 01:03:37.390
If I can suss out the light source
maybe I can make some sort of

01:03:37.460 --> 01:03:40.327
UV flash-bang grenade
or something.

01:03:40.396 --> 01:03:42.057
It's been tried already.

01:03:42.131 --> 01:03:45.066
Yeah, but you didn't have
the Scudster working on it then.

01:03:57.413 --> 01:03:59.813
- Blade.
- Hmm?

01:03:59.882 --> 01:04:03.113
- The way you talk to them-- us.
- What is it?

01:04:03.186 --> 01:04:05.450
We are together
in this, remember?

01:04:06.856 --> 01:04:08.756
Why do you hate us
so much?

01:04:08.825 --> 01:04:10.656
It's fate.

01:04:11.928 --> 01:04:14.362
- It's in my blood.
- It's in mine, too.

01:04:14.430 --> 01:04:16.921
I'm a pure blood.
I was born a vampire.

01:04:22.538 --> 01:04:24.733
You know the thirst
better than any of us,

01:04:24.807 --> 01:04:26.832
shooting that serum
of yours.

01:04:26.909 --> 01:04:28.638
The only difference
between us,

01:04:28.711 --> 01:04:32.477
is that I made peace with
what I am a long time ago.

01:04:39.555 --> 01:04:41.819
How long have
you known Blade, anyway?

01:04:41.891 --> 01:04:43.586
Going on 20 years.

01:04:43.659 --> 01:04:46.492
He doesn't talk about
the old days that much.

01:04:46.562 --> 01:04:48.655
Blade doesn't talk
about anything much.

01:04:50.066 --> 01:04:52.000
You want to hear
something funny?

01:04:52.068 --> 01:04:55.162
Blade kind of looks at you
like a father figure.

01:04:56.773 --> 01:04:59.003
Tell me something.

01:04:59.075 --> 01:05:00.474
How'd you two hook up?

01:05:01.677 --> 01:05:03.110
I was backpacking.

01:05:03.179 --> 01:05:05.579
I met these two chicks,
decided to take them back

01:05:05.648 --> 01:05:09.243
to my tent for a little
''Three's Company'' action.

01:05:09.318 --> 01:05:11.445
- Pretty.
- Next thing I know, Janet and Chrissy

01:05:11.521 --> 01:05:13.421
start tearing chunks
out of my stomach.

01:05:13.489 --> 01:05:16.515
Blade shows up,
saves my ass.

01:05:16.592 --> 01:05:18.992
Everything else just sort of
fell into place.

01:05:22.165 --> 01:05:24.656
- Let's try it.
- All right.

01:05:37.046 --> 01:05:39.378
Maybe I fucked up.
Maybe you were right.

01:05:44.887 --> 01:05:46.184
All right.

01:05:46.255 --> 01:05:48.723
Papa's got
a brand new bag.

01:06:28.531 --> 01:06:30.465
Let me ask one question.

01:06:30.533 --> 01:06:32.797
How are we going to find
these Reapers?

01:06:32.869 --> 01:06:34.632
We won't have to.

01:06:34.704 --> 01:06:36.137
They'll come to us.

01:06:41.210 --> 01:06:43.474
- What is this shit?
- Pheromones.

01:06:43.546 --> 01:06:46.140
Harvested from the Reapers'
adrenal glands.

01:06:46.215 --> 01:06:48.149
They're going to key to it.

01:06:50.219 --> 01:06:54.087
They want us to spray on
some suckpuppy's nut juice?

01:06:55.224 --> 01:06:57.818
First use your firearms
to drive them back.

01:06:57.894 --> 01:07:00.124
- Then toss your UV grenades.
- Right on.

01:07:00.196 --> 01:07:02.255
This is what we got
for the grand finale.

01:07:02.331 --> 01:07:04.026
I hot-wired a couple
of these babies

01:07:04.100 --> 01:07:06.432
into a nitro-vacuum.

01:07:06.502 --> 01:07:08.936
Just be real careful
where you pop your load.

01:07:09.005 --> 01:07:11.337
And you,
you're not coming?

01:07:11.407 --> 01:07:14.274
No. I'm a lover,
not a fighter.

01:07:15.678 --> 01:07:17.771
UV's have
a 1 0-second delay.

01:07:19.348 --> 01:07:21.282
Nyssa...

01:07:21.350 --> 01:07:23.443
just remember
to take cover.

01:07:26.522 --> 01:07:28.786
Hey, Blade, give me a hand.

01:07:33.362 --> 01:07:36.456
You and Miss Muffet
getting a little cozy?

01:07:36.532 --> 01:07:39.968
I wouldn't worry
about that if I were you.

01:07:40.036 --> 01:07:41.970
Looks to me like you're
getting confused

01:07:42.038 --> 01:07:44.472
as to which side of the line
you're standing on.

01:07:45.708 --> 01:07:48.142
Those are real hollow words
coming from a man

01:07:48.210 --> 01:07:51.304
wh just spent tw years
running with the ene my.

01:07:51.380 --> 01:07:53.814
And what the hell
is that supposed to mean?

01:07:56.218 --> 01:07:59.153
You know, Whistler,
there's an old saying--

01:07:59.221 --> 01:08:01.587
''Keep your friends close,

01:08:01.657 --> 01:08:04.421
but keep your enemies closer.''

01:08:04.493 --> 01:08:06.518
You might want
to remember that.

01:08:30.620 --> 01:08:33.783
Blade, we should split
into three units.

01:09:46.194 --> 01:09:47.787
We're trying
to attract them,

01:09:47.863 --> 01:09:49.455
not scare them off.

01:09:49.532 --> 01:09:51.966
Yeah, well, some of us
can't see in the dark,

01:09:52.033 --> 01:09:55.470
you fucking nipplehead.
What am I supposed to do?

01:09:55.538 --> 01:09:58.029
Bifocals, grandpa.
And try to keep up.

01:10:55.264 --> 01:10:57.198
Let's do this.

01:11:03.005 --> 01:11:06.133
- Hey, hillbilly.
- What the fuck you doing?

01:11:07.710 --> 01:11:10.110
Ain't nobody here
but you...

01:11:10.179 --> 01:11:12.647
and us, buttercup.

01:11:15.317 --> 01:11:18.150
We lose a partner,
and Blade loses one!

01:11:25.895 --> 01:11:28.796
I'll leave you two lovebirds
some time to yourselves.

01:12:38.567 --> 01:12:40.501
Ah!

01:13:03.359 --> 01:13:06.123
I spotted a group
in the east tunnel.

01:13:06.195 --> 01:13:08.129
I'm prepping
the bomb pack.

01:13:08.197 --> 01:13:10.131
Nyssa.

01:13:32.321 --> 01:13:33.913
Get out!

01:13:35.090 --> 01:13:36.648
Right now!

01:13:40.095 --> 01:13:41.653
No!

01:13:45.234 --> 01:13:46.667
No!

01:13:49.638 --> 01:13:52.004
I'll attract them to me.
Do what I tell you.

01:13:52.074 --> 01:13:53.666
Move!

01:13:56.078 --> 01:13:57.943
1 0...

01:13:58.013 --> 01:13:59.503
nine...

01:13:59.581 --> 01:14:01.150
eight...

01:14:01.150 --> 01:14:03.141
seven...

01:14:03.218 --> 01:14:04.845
six...

01:14:04.920 --> 01:14:07.548
five...

01:14:07.623 --> 01:14:09.921
four...

01:14:09.992 --> 01:14:11.926
three...

01:14:11.994 --> 01:14:13.518
two...

01:14:16.465 --> 01:14:17.796
one.

01:14:42.725 --> 01:14:44.283
Piece of junk.

01:14:58.073 --> 01:15:00.132
What the hell is this?

01:15:01.410 --> 01:15:04.004
You trying to stink me
to death, old man?

01:15:14.356 --> 01:15:16.290
Wait.

01:15:17.693 --> 01:15:19.854
- You okay?
- Yeah.

01:15:19.928 --> 01:15:21.691
We got to move.

01:15:21.764 --> 01:15:23.391
We got a lot
of company.

01:15:26.301 --> 01:15:29.498
All units, regroup.
Regroup!

01:15:55.664 --> 01:15:58.326
Eat shit,
you ugly motherfuckers!

01:16:01.537 --> 01:16:03.528
There's nobody left!

01:16:23.358 --> 01:16:25.656
- Where's the bomb pack?
- Down that tunnel.

01:16:25.727 --> 01:16:28.321
Give me the rest
of the pheromones.

01:16:30.666 --> 01:16:32.600
Go down that tunnel!

01:16:32.668 --> 01:16:34.465
Go, go, go, go!

01:16:35.871 --> 01:16:37.532
You obviously...

01:16:37.606 --> 01:16:39.904
do not know...

01:16:39.975 --> 01:16:41.909
whom you are fucking with!

01:17:17.045 --> 01:17:18.706
By the way, Blade.

01:17:18.780 --> 01:17:21.943
Did I happen to mention
the bomb lever is stuck?

01:17:27.689 --> 01:17:29.452
Suck this!

01:17:31.693 --> 01:17:33.456
Let's go!

01:18:13.669 --> 01:18:16.502
You want a bite of me?
Well, come on!

01:18:16.572 --> 01:18:18.062
Come on, motherfucker!

01:19:37.019 --> 01:19:39.180
Whistler.

01:19:39.254 --> 01:19:41.154
Wait.

01:19:41.223 --> 01:19:43.521
You will survive this

01:19:43.592 --> 01:19:45.219
only to tell Blade...

01:19:46.762 --> 01:19:48.320
about this ring.

01:19:48.397 --> 01:19:50.627
About the truth.

01:19:50.699 --> 01:19:52.860
The truth, old man.

01:19:55.037 --> 01:19:57.130
Damaskinos...

01:20:05.213 --> 01:20:07.147
Nyssa.

01:21:35.303 --> 01:21:37.168
You've done
a great job.

01:21:38.907 --> 01:21:41.671
Not that great--
I'd say.

01:22:03.865 --> 01:22:07.631
What is it,
my daughter?

01:22:57.085 --> 01:22:58.416
They took them.

01:22:58.487 --> 01:23:00.978
All our weapons.
Even your sword.

01:23:01.056 --> 01:23:03.581
Somebody's been keeping tabs
on us from inside.

01:23:03.658 --> 01:23:06.456
- Where are we?
- Some kind of chamber

01:23:06.528 --> 01:23:08.223
deep in their lair.

01:23:08.296 --> 01:23:10.287
They smashed up
everything--

01:23:10.365 --> 01:23:12.458
the workshop,
all of it.

01:23:13.802 --> 01:23:17.135
They've been lying
to us from day one.

01:23:17.205 --> 01:23:20.231
The reaper strain
didn't evolve...

01:23:20.308 --> 01:23:21.832
it was designed.

01:23:21.910 --> 01:23:23.605
What?

01:23:23.678 --> 01:23:26.010
Designed.
Nomak told me.

01:23:26.081 --> 01:23:27.810
I saw him back
in the sewer.

01:23:27.883 --> 01:23:31.182
- He let me live.
- Did he?

01:23:31.253 --> 01:23:33.778
How generous of him.

01:23:33.855 --> 01:23:37.313
I brought you here to see
the fruits of our labor.

01:23:41.630 --> 01:23:43.564
For years I've struggled

01:23:43.632 --> 01:23:48.296
to rid our kind of
any hereditary weaknesses.

01:23:48.370 --> 01:23:52.272
And so, recombining DNA...

01:23:52.340 --> 01:23:55.104
was simply the next
logical step.

01:23:57.345 --> 01:23:59.370
Nomak was the first.

01:23:59.447 --> 01:24:01.540
A failure.

01:24:01.616 --> 01:24:03.277
But in time,

01:24:03.351 --> 01:24:06.616
there will be a new
pure race,

01:24:06.688 --> 01:24:08.986
begotten from my own flesh,

01:24:09.057 --> 01:24:12.083
immune to silver,

01:24:12.160 --> 01:24:15.152
soon even sunlight.

01:24:15.230 --> 01:24:18.563
I got a question for you,
you lying son of a bitch.

01:24:18.633 --> 01:24:21.329
You want to explain how Nomak
got ahold of this ring?

01:24:32.013 --> 01:24:35.312
I would have thought
that was obvious at this point.

01:24:35.383 --> 01:24:37.317
I gave it to him,
of course.

01:24:37.385 --> 01:24:40.320
A gift from father
to son.

01:24:51.499 --> 01:24:54.195
I thought
he'd never leave.

01:24:59.774 --> 01:25:02.504
The wolf has lain
with the sheep long enough.

01:25:02.577 --> 01:25:04.772
Reinhardt,

01:25:04.846 --> 01:25:07.610
you can kiss
your ass goodbye.

01:25:15.523 --> 01:25:17.320
I'm sorry, man.

01:25:17.392 --> 01:25:19.326
B, you're wasting
your time, man.

01:25:19.394 --> 01:25:21.123
The bomb's a dud.

01:25:21.196 --> 01:25:22.959
It was never supposed
to explode.

01:25:23.031 --> 01:25:25.522
It was just supposed
to make you feel in control.

01:25:25.600 --> 01:25:28.433
You thought you had me
on a short leash,

01:25:28.503 --> 01:25:30.198
didn't you, jefe?

01:25:37.812 --> 01:25:39.370
Much better.

01:25:42.817 --> 01:25:44.045
See this?

01:25:45.887 --> 01:25:48.219
I'm one of Damaskinos'
familiars.

01:25:48.289 --> 01:25:50.951
They needed my help
to bring you here to control Nomak.

01:25:51.026 --> 01:25:53.324
The old fuck,
he was always just bait.

01:25:53.395 --> 01:25:55.158
I mean, look at him.

01:25:55.230 --> 01:25:56.993
He's y ur  nly
real weakness, man.

01:25:57.065 --> 01:25:58.828
You may be fast,
you may be strong,

01:25:58.900 --> 01:26:00.492
and all that other
bullshit,

01:26:00.568 --> 01:26:02.001
but in the end, B...

01:26:02.070 --> 01:26:03.765
you're just too human!

01:26:05.674 --> 01:26:07.107
Well, you little shit.

01:26:11.513 --> 01:26:14.277
You think they scoped out
my security system?

01:26:14.349 --> 01:26:16.442
I let them in, asshole!

01:26:17.719 --> 01:26:19.482
I practically
handed them the keys.

01:26:19.554 --> 01:26:21.419
You heard cue ball, right?

01:26:21.489 --> 01:26:24.287
Pretty soon they're all going
to be daywalkers.

01:26:24.359 --> 01:26:26.122
When that happens,

01:26:26.194 --> 01:26:28.094
I'd rather be a pet
than cattle.

01:26:28.163 --> 01:26:29.755
You got me, B?

01:26:31.833 --> 01:26:35.234
- What do you think about that?
- Two things--

01:26:35.303 --> 01:26:37.294
one...

01:26:37.372 --> 01:26:41.206
I've been onto you
since they turned you.

01:26:41.276 --> 01:26:43.210
And two...

01:26:44.946 --> 01:26:46.538
it's not a dud.

01:26:47.682 --> 01:26:49.081
Ah, great.

01:26:57.392 --> 01:26:59.758
I was just starting
to like him.

01:26:59.828 --> 01:27:01.557
Take him down!

01:27:34.696 --> 01:27:36.960
We're going to harvest
your blood,

01:27:37.031 --> 01:27:38.464
every drop of it.

01:27:38.533 --> 01:27:42.697
Then bone marrow,
organs, everything.

01:27:42.771 --> 01:27:44.636
We'll find
the missing key

01:27:44.706 --> 01:27:46.731
to creating daywalkers.

01:27:54.282 --> 01:27:56.216
Now this
might hurt a bit.

01:28:00.221 --> 01:28:01.916
Nice.

01:28:03.358 --> 01:28:05.417
I wonder...

01:28:05.493 --> 01:28:08.951
how many vampires
he's killed with this thing.

01:28:09.030 --> 01:28:10.827
Not nearly enough, Fritz.

01:28:12.534 --> 01:28:14.024
Keep talking, honky-tonk.

01:28:14.102 --> 01:28:16.798
Just makes my sending you
to the next world

01:28:16.871 --> 01:28:20.398
- all the sweeter.
- Been there, done that.

01:28:20.475 --> 01:28:22.943
Do your worst,
chickenshit.

01:28:23.011 --> 01:28:24.842
We'll settle up after.

01:28:46.534 --> 01:28:48.900
What else
should I find out?

01:28:48.970 --> 01:28:51.632
I trusted you--

01:28:51.706 --> 01:28:54.140
with my men;

01:28:54.209 --> 01:28:56.302
with my will;

01:28:56.377 --> 01:28:58.311
with my life.

01:29:01.482 --> 01:29:03.279
You sent us out there.

01:29:05.753 --> 01:29:07.584
You sent me to die.

01:29:10.658 --> 01:29:12.751
Our enemy saved
my life twice,

01:29:12.827 --> 01:29:17.423
and you have used us--
your own children.

01:29:18.933 --> 01:29:21.026
Make no mistake, Nyssa,

01:29:21.102 --> 01:29:24.333
those blood ties
mean nothing to me

01:29:24.405 --> 01:29:26.896
when measured against
the ascendancy of our race.

01:29:29.043 --> 01:29:33.036
Who do you think
God really favors in the web?

01:29:35.750 --> 01:29:38.878
The spider, or the fly?

01:29:43.691 --> 01:29:45.625
Nomak.

01:29:50.865 --> 01:29:52.890
What about him?

01:29:52.967 --> 01:29:56.027
He wants revenge...

01:29:56.104 --> 01:29:59.073
on the people...

01:29:59.140 --> 01:30:01.404
who created him.

01:30:01.476 --> 01:30:04.138
You may be right.

01:30:04.212 --> 01:30:06.874
But fortunately
for us,

01:30:06.948 --> 01:30:09.041
he doesn't know
this location.

01:30:11.219 --> 01:30:15.679
Now... he does.

01:30:44.752 --> 01:30:46.686
What the fuck?

01:31:40.575 --> 01:31:42.042
Come on, kid.

01:31:42.110 --> 01:31:44.943
Don't you even think
about dying on me.

01:31:46.481 --> 01:31:50.713
You didn't give up on me,
I won't give up on you.

01:31:50.785 --> 01:31:52.719
Come on-- Blade.

01:32:00.928 --> 01:32:03.795
Blood...

01:32:03.865 --> 01:32:06.129
Yeah.

01:32:06.200 --> 01:32:08.134
Blood.

01:32:43.571 --> 01:32:45.630
Father!

01:32:45.706 --> 01:32:47.640
He'll never enter here.

01:32:54.882 --> 01:32:56.782
Father!

01:33:22.043 --> 01:33:23.977
Father!

01:33:51.906 --> 01:33:53.840
Go on, kid.

01:33:56.978 --> 01:33:58.172
Go!

01:36:16.717 --> 01:36:18.514
Get him!

01:36:31.632 --> 01:36:32.997
Get in there!

01:36:47.715 --> 01:36:51.151
Hmm. Well...

01:36:51.218 --> 01:36:54.153
like my daddy said
before he killed my mom,

01:36:54.221 --> 01:36:56.155
''You want anything
done right,

01:36:56.223 --> 01:36:57.815
you got to do it
yourself.''

01:37:01.962 --> 01:37:03.429
He also said--

01:37:19.680 --> 01:37:21.614
Can you blush?

01:37:35.629 --> 01:37:37.290
Hey, kid.

01:38:17.338 --> 01:38:19.704
I reset
the security code.

01:38:21.175 --> 01:38:24.611
- We're locked in.
- Are you insane?

01:38:26.514 --> 01:38:28.948
- He'll kill us both.
- Yes.

01:38:31.352 --> 01:38:34.446
Isn't it sad that you die not
by the hand of your enemy,

01:38:35.856 --> 01:38:37.790
but by that of your own
children?

01:38:47.701 --> 01:38:49.601
Father.

01:40:23.697 --> 01:40:25.494
Nyssa.

01:41:15.549 --> 01:41:17.141
Nomak!

01:41:21.221 --> 01:41:24.088
Blade,
it could end right here.

01:41:24.158 --> 01:41:26.319
What do you think, huh?

01:44:22.703 --> 01:44:24.466
After all,

01:44:24.538 --> 01:44:27.473
it looks like I've finished
my father's job.

01:45:29.870 --> 01:45:31.804
It's strange.

01:45:31.872 --> 01:45:33.533
It hurts...

01:45:33.607 --> 01:45:36.132
it hurts no more.

01:46:35.202 --> 01:46:37.295
It won't be long.

01:46:38.538 --> 01:46:41.632
I can already feel it
burning inside of me.

01:46:45.545 --> 01:46:48.810
I want to die
while I'm still a vampire.

01:47:02.162 --> 01:47:04.596
I want to see the sun.

01:48:39.192 --> 01:48:40.784
By booth number three.

01:48:40.861 --> 01:48:42.453
Enjoy, man.

01:48:48.535 --> 01:48:52.471
Are you sure
that the girls are live?

01:48:52.539 --> 01:48:54.302
Last time I checked.

01:48:54.374 --> 01:48:56.103
Thank you.

01:48:56.176 --> 01:48:58.974
A couple of razor blades,
just in case...

01:49:07.087 --> 01:49:09.885
You didn't think I forgot
about you, did you?
