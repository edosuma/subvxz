WEBVTT

00:00.930 --> 00:02.022
- I MEAN, WE'RE JUST
STUDYING, RIGHT?

00:02.140 --> 00:03.573
WE'RE NOT TRYING TO FLIRT
WITH OUR S.A.T. TUTOR?

00:03.690 --> 00:05.089
IT'S MAKING ME FEEL LIKE
I'M CRASHING A DATE

00:05.210 --> 00:06.438
WITH YOU AND HOWARD.

00:06.550 --> 00:09.724
- THIS IS KIND OF HOW
I HOPED IT WOULD BE.

00:09.830 --> 00:12.765
AND...

00:12.870 --> 00:14.007
BOOM.

00:14.110 --> 00:16.101
- I SHOULD GIVE YOU
BACK THIS RING

00:16.220 --> 00:17.426
BEFORE YOU LOSE IT.

00:17.530 --> 00:19.009
- I'M REALLY TOUCHED.
I'M SO EXCITED.

00:19.120 --> 00:20.599
- I DIDN'T SUGGEST YOU
FOR THE BOOTH JOB.

00:20.710 --> 00:22.519
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
GORDON SAID THAT YOU DID.

00:22.640 --> 00:24.358
- HE USUALLY HAS
AN ULTERIOR MOTIVE.

00:24.470 --> 00:27.394
- YOU REALLY DON'T GET
HOW AMAZING YOU ARE, DO YOU?

00:35.130 --> 00:36.688
- HEY, HONEY.

00:36.790 --> 00:37.688
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

00:37.790 --> 00:39.303
- BEING FESTIVE.

00:39.410 --> 00:41.856
- HONEY, ORANGE IS
FOR DOCTOR APPOINTMENTS,

00:41.970 --> 00:43.130
NOT FOR HALLOWEEN.

00:43.250 --> 00:44.239
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
I WAS THINKING,

00:44.350 --> 00:45.658
SPEAKING OF THAT, THAT--
- PURPLE.

00:45.760 --> 00:48.274
- LOOK, I KNOW THAT USUALLY
WE STAY HOME ON HALLOWEEN,

00:48.390 --> 00:49.596
BUT I WAS THINKING
MAYBE THIS YEAR

00:49.700 --> 00:52.419
WE'D TRY TAKING MAX OVER
TO MY PARENTS' HOUSE.

00:53.950 --> 00:55.144
- YOU'RE NOT SERIOUS.

00:55.260 --> 00:56.591
THERE'S NO--
- IT'S HALLOWEEN.

00:56.710 --> 00:58.109
- GO AHEAD.
ASK HIM.

00:58.230 --> 01:00.425
- HEY, MAX, UH, YOU KNOW
HOW WE USUALLY AT STAY HOME

01:00.540 --> 01:01.564
ON--ON HALLOWEEN?

01:01.680 --> 01:03.227
I WAS THINKING
THAT MAYBE THIS YEAR,

01:03.330 --> 01:05.218
WE'D GO OVER
TO GRANDPA AND GRANDMA'S.

01:05.340 --> 01:06.739
- I DO NOT WANT TO.

01:06.850 --> 01:08.260
- HMM.
- IT'S SO MUCH FUN.

01:08.370 --> 01:09.541
- COULD YOU OPEN THIS?
- YOU GET TO DRESS UP IN A--

01:09.650 --> 01:10.958
- HONEY, IT'S OKAY.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO.

01:11.070 --> 01:12.139
- I WANT TO GO
TRICK-OR-TREATING.

01:12.240 --> 01:13.138
- IT WAS JUST AN IDEA.

01:13.240 --> 01:14.446
- I WANT TO GO
TRICK-OR-TREATING.

01:14.550 --> 01:15.517
- REALLY?
- MAX, HONEY...

01:15.620 --> 01:17.201
YOU'VE NEVER
BEEN TRICK-OR-TREATING.

01:17.310 --> 01:18.868
- HE WAS
TRICK-OR-TREATING ONCE.

01:18.970 --> 01:20.653
- WHEN HE WAS 18 MONTHS OLD.

01:20.770 --> 01:22.340
- MAX, ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT
TO GO TRICK-OR-TREATING?

01:22.460 --> 01:23.688
- WELL, YOU GET CANDY...
- REALLY?

01:23.800 --> 01:25.939
- FOR JUST GOING UP TO A DOOR
AND ASKING.

01:26.050 --> 01:27.904
- YES, YOU DO.
THAT IS CORRECT.

01:28.010 --> 01:29.079
- HOLD ON.
- AND IT'S SO...

01:29.190 --> 01:30.396
- YOU WALK UP TO A DOOR,
YOU KNOCK.

01:30.500 --> 01:32.536
YOU CAN DRESS UP
HOWEVER YOU WANT TO DRESS UP.

01:32.640 --> 01:34.221
YOU CAN PICK YOUR OWN COSTUME.
YOU COULD BE A PIRATE.

01:34.330 --> 01:35.979
- MMM.
- I WANT TO BE A COCKROACH.

01:36.090 --> 01:37.250
- OR A COCKROACH.

01:37.370 --> 01:38.598
- COME ON, SYD!

01:38.710 --> 01:40.780
- MOMMY, I KNOW WHAT I WANT
TO BE FOR HALLOWEEN.

01:40.890 --> 01:42.926
- YOU DO?
HERE, WORK WITH ME.

01:43.030 --> 01:44.167
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO BE?

01:44.270 --> 01:45.885
- I WANT TO BE A BEAUTY QUEEN.

01:46.000 --> 01:47.513
- COME AGAIN?

01:47.620 --> 01:50.589
- I WANT TO BE
MISS CALIFORNIA.

01:50.690 --> 01:52.248
- SWEETIE...

01:52.350 --> 01:54.102
WHY DON'T YOU
WANT TO BE A LADYBUG...

01:54.210 --> 01:56.383
LIKE YOU WERE LAST YEAR?
THAT WAS SO CUTE.

01:56.490 --> 01:57.627
- WELL...
- HERE, CAN YOU PUT THAT ON?

01:57.730 --> 01:59.413
- I WAS A LADYBUG
WHEN I WAS LITTLE.

01:59.530 --> 02:02.499
- I THINK YOU'RE STILL
PRETTY LITTLE.

02:02.600 --> 02:03.350
- MOMMY, STOP.

02:03.460 --> 02:05.087
- [laughs]
- I'M NOT LI'I'I'LE.

02:05.190 --> 02:08.250
AND I WANT TO BE
MISS CALIFORNIA.

02:08.360 --> 02:10.772
- OKAY.
WHY DON'T WE DISCUSS IT LATER?

02:10.880 --> 02:14.407
- NO, MOM, I KNOW WHAT I WANT.
I WANT TO BE MISS CALIFORNIA.

02:14.510 --> 02:16.432
- OKAY, WE'RE GONNA THINK
ABOUT IT,

02:16.550 --> 02:17.676
AND THEN...

02:17.790 --> 02:19.997
WE'LL DISCUSS IT LATER.

02:20.100 --> 02:22.091
- IS YOUR GRANDPA
EXCITED ENOUGH

02:22.210 --> 02:23.279
ABOUT HALLOWEEN,
YOU THINK?

02:23.380 --> 02:25.029
- YEAH, I KNOW.
- GOOD MORNING.

02:25.140 --> 02:26.277
IT'S SO TIGHT,
I CAN'T EVEN BREATHE.

02:26.380 --> 02:27.347
CAN YOU HELP ME--
- YOU LOOK REALLY HOT.

02:27.450 --> 02:30.203
BET IT'S FOR THAT
FORKLIFT-OPERATOR GUY, HUH?

02:30.320 --> 02:32.527
- OH, WELL, ACTUALLY,
THAT'S SORT OF OVER.

02:32.630 --> 02:34.518
- WHO'S FORKLIFT GUY?
- NO, IT'S DONE.

02:34.630 --> 02:36.313
- WELL, YOU'RE DRESSING
FOR SOMEONE.

02:36.430 --> 02:38.660
- [grunts]
GUESS WHAT.

02:38.770 --> 02:39.976
I FOUND MY ZOMBIE ARM.

02:40.090 --> 02:42.558
- GOSH, COOL.
- UH-OH.

02:42.670 --> 02:44.251
- LOOK AT ALL OF THIS.
- HEY, CAN I SEE THE LEG?

02:44.370 --> 02:45.394
CAN I SEE THE LEG?
- YEAH.

02:45.510 --> 02:47.125
WE GOT THREE DAYS
TILL HALLOWEEN.

02:47.230 --> 02:48.606
THAT MEANS WE ARE BEHIND.

02:48.720 --> 02:51.052
- BEHIND THE NEIGHBORS OR--
- NOBODY MAKE ANY PLANS.

02:51.170 --> 02:52.990
ALL RIGHT?
I WANT ALL HANDS ON DECK HERE.

02:53.100 --> 02:54.476
WE ARE GONNA SCARE THE PISS

02:54.580 --> 02:56.332
OUT OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD KIDS
THIS YEAR.

02:56.450 --> 02:58.475
- OH, ZEEK, WE'RE NOT SCARING
THE PISS OUT OF ANYBODY.

02:58.590 --> 03:00.103
- AMBER WOULD LIKE
TO SCARE THE PISS

03:00.210 --> 03:01.586
OUT OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD KIDS.

03:01.690 --> 03:03.339
- I DO. THAT'S RIGHT UP
MY ALLEY, BUT I CAN'T.

03:03.450 --> 03:05.896
I HAVE TO GO
TO KELSEY'S MOM'S BENEFIT THING.

03:06.010 --> 03:07.796
- UH, SARAH, YOU TELL AMBER

03:07.910 --> 03:10.378
THAT SHE'S GOT TO SPEND
HALLOWEEN WITH HER FAMILY.

03:10.500 --> 03:11.592
- I'M REALLY SORRY, DAD.

03:11.700 --> 03:12.906
IT'S PROBABLY A BAD TIME
TO TELL YOU.

03:13.020 --> 03:15.011
BUT I CAN'T BE THERE EITHER,

03:15.120 --> 03:16.280
UM, 'CAUSE I GOT TO WORK
AT THE BAR.

03:16.400 --> 03:18.152
- WAIT A MINUTE.
HONEY...

03:18.260 --> 03:19.739
SWEETHEART,
THIS IS IMPORTANT TO ME.

03:19.850 --> 03:21.465
- DAD, I DON'T MAKE MONEY
AT THIS DAY JOB.

03:21.580 --> 03:22.649
AND, YOU KNOW,
IT'S A BIG NIGHT FOR TIPS.

03:22.750 --> 03:24.570
SO, UM--BUT I'LL BE
WEARING A COSTUME.

03:24.680 --> 03:25.817
- SO WILL I.
I WILL TOO.

03:27.960 --> 03:29.609
- OKAY.
- BYE.

03:31.620 --> 03:33.656
- HEY.

03:33.760 --> 03:35.751
[growling]

03:35.870 --> 03:36.791
BLAH.

03:36.900 --> 03:38.037
[monster voice]
WELL...

03:38.140 --> 03:41.621
I GUESS IT'S JUST
YOU AND ME, KID.

03:41.730 --> 03:43.766
- DON'T YOU WANT
TO AT LEAST GO INSIDE

03:43.870 --> 03:44.552
AND SEE WHAT IT'S LIKE?

03:44.670 --> 03:46.524
- WHAT TIME
WILL YOU PICK ME UP?

03:46.640 --> 03:48.210
- BUDDY, YOU'RE GONNA BE
HAVING SO MUCH FUN,

03:48.330 --> 03:51.254
YOU'RE NOT EVEN GONNA WANT US
TO COME BACK.

03:51.360 --> 03:52.566
- 2:30, RIGHT ON THE DOT.

03:52.680 --> 03:54.329
- WHAT IF I DON'T FEEL GOOD?

03:54.440 --> 03:55.884
COULD I COME HOME SOONER?

03:55.990 --> 03:59.027
- [chuckles]
UM...

03:59.130 --> 04:01.644
DUDE, THIS IS INCREDIBLE.

04:01.750 --> 04:04.571
HOW DID YOU DO THIS?
- DO WHAT?

04:04.690 --> 04:06.510
- DO WHAT? YOU HAVE THE BEST
CUBBY IN THE WHOLE CLASS.

04:06.620 --> 04:08.656
IT'S BLUE,
YOUR FAVORITE COLOR.

04:08.760 --> 04:10.239
IT'S AT WAIST LEVEL,
SO YOU DON'T HURT YOUR BACK

04:10.350 --> 04:11.556
WHEN YOU'RE PUTTING YOUR PACK
IN THERE.

04:11.660 --> 04:13.389
DID YOU PAY SOMEONE OFF
TO GET IT?

04:13.490 --> 04:15.697
- I DIDN'T.
- MAYBE YOU'RE JUST LUCKY.

04:15.800 --> 04:18.451
YOU WANT TO GIVE IT A SHOT?
LET'S SEE IT.

04:18.560 --> 04:20.357
- OOP!

04:22.880 --> 04:24.666
- ARE YOU NEW?

04:24.780 --> 04:27.419
DO YOU WANT TO SEE
THE CLASS PET?

04:27.540 --> 04:30.088
HIS NAME IS MARVIN,
AND HE EATS CRICKETS.

04:30.200 --> 04:34.193
SOM ETIM ES
HE LEAVES THE HEADS.

04:34.300 --> 04:35.619
- OKAY.

04:35.720 --> 04:38.336
HAVE A GOOD DAY.
- OKAY.

04:40.590 --> 04:43.104
- THEY WERE HOLDING HANDS...
- THAT IS SO CUTE.

04:43.210 --> 04:45.678
- THE LITTLE GUY
WITH GLASSES.

05:02.230 --> 05:04.323
HI.
[laughs] I WAS...

05:04.440 --> 05:05.361
HOW ARE YOU?

05:05.470 --> 05:07.051

05:12.240 --> 05:13.923
OKAY.

05:14.030 --> 05:15.338
OH, OH, OH.

05:15.450 --> 05:16.724
- YEAH?

05:16.830 --> 05:19.037
- SARAH, I'VE BEEN MEANING
TO TELL YOU.

05:19.140 --> 05:22.792
UH...

05:22.900 --> 05:25.209
THE SPECS
ON THE MX-20 ARE LATE,

05:25.320 --> 05:26.867
AND, YOU KNOW,
THAT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY.

05:26.980 --> 05:28.663
AND I NEED YOU
TO HAVE THE DESIGN TEAM

05:28.770 --> 05:32.706
HAVE THAT ON MY DESK
NO LATER THAN TOMORROW, OKAY?

05:32.810 --> 05:34.357
- RIGHT.

05:34.470 --> 05:36.119
- OKAY.

05:39.300 --> 05:41.768
- MAY GOD BLESS
AND KEEP YOU ALWAYS

05:41.890 --> 05:44.643
AND MAY YOUR WISHES
ALL COME TRUE

05:44.750 --> 05:46.752
MAY YOU ALWAYS DO
FOR OTHERS

05:46.860 --> 05:49.374
AND LET OTHERS DO FOR YOU

05:49.480 --> 05:51.994
MAY YOU BUILD A LADDER
TO THE STARS

05:52.110 --> 05:53.998
AND CLIMB ON EVERY RUNG

05:54.110 --> 05:55.964
AND MAY YOU STAY

05:56.070 --> 05:58.868
FOREVER YOUNG

05:58.970 --> 06:01.598
MAY YOU GROW UP

06:01.700 --> 06:03.804
MAY YOU GROW UP
TO BE TRUE

06:03.910 --> 06:06.526
MAY YOU ALWAYS KNOW
THE TRUTH

06:06.640 --> 06:08.779
AND SEE THE LIGHTS
SURROUNDING YOU

06:08.880 --> 06:11.496
MAY YOU ALWAYS BE
COURAGEOUS

06:11.610 --> 06:13.578
STAND UPRIGHT
AND BE STRONG

06:13.680 --> 06:15.568
AND MAY YOU STAY

06:15.680 --> 06:18.262
FOREVER YOUNG

06:18.370 --> 06:20.053
MAY YOU STAY

06:20.170 --> 06:22.058
FOREVER YOUNG

06:27.760 --> 06:30.558
- HALLOWEEN CAN BE
A VERY CHALLENGING HOLIDAY

06:30.660 --> 06:32.241
FOR THESE KIDS, HONESTLY.
- EXACTLY.

06:32.350 --> 06:34.659
- IT'S NO QUESTION.
- OKAY, SO...

06:34.770 --> 06:35.794
WE JUST NEVER GO OUT
IN THE WORLD?

06:35.910 --> 06:37.730
WE JUST SEQUESTER OURSELVES
IN OUR HOUSE?

06:37.840 --> 06:40.047
- WHAT WOULD YOU SAY WOULD BE
THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES

06:40.150 --> 06:42.209
FOR MAX WITH HALLOWEEN?

06:42.330 --> 06:43.319
- CANDLES.
- CANDLES?

06:43.430 --> 06:44.943
- THE PEOPLE.
- FIRE.

06:45.050 --> 06:46.915
- THE SCARY COSTUMES.
- HE'S UNCOMFORTABLE WITH FIRE.

06:47.020 --> 06:48.226
- BUT HE HAS--

06:48.330 --> 06:49.570
- THAT IS A MASSIVE
UNDERSTATEMENT.

06:49.680 --> 06:50.840
- THIS IS IMPORTANT TO ME.

06:50.960 --> 06:52.916
- RIGHT.
- THIS IS OUR FAMILY'S HOLIDAY.

06:53.030 --> 06:55.055
- THAT'S BECAUSE
YOUR FAMILY'S INSANE.

06:55.170 --> 06:56.956
- IT'S ONE HOLIDAY

06:57.070 --> 06:58.788
THAT WE HAVE WHERE THERE ISN'T
ANY FAMILY DRAMA.

06:58.900 --> 06:59.787
- HONEY...

06:59.900 --> 07:01.959
- AND I WOULD LIKE MY SON
TO BE A PART OF IT.

07:02.070 --> 07:03.549
- ACTUALLY, GUESS WHAT.

07:03.660 --> 07:06.276
OKAY, A FEW YEARS AGO,
I CELEBRATED HALLOWEEN.

07:06.390 --> 07:08.597
I DIDN'T WANT MAX
TO FEEL LEFT OUT.

07:08.700 --> 07:10.907
SO WE SORT OF MADE
A GAME OUT OF IT, OKAY?

07:11.010 --> 07:12.830
WE TURNED OFF
ALL THE LIGHTS.

07:12.940 --> 07:15.010
AND WE HID FROM ALL
THE TRICK-OR-TREATERS.

07:15.120 --> 07:16.667
WE WENT UPSTAIRS, AND WE PLAYED
A GAME OF MONOPOLY

07:16.780 --> 07:18.941
WITH THE FLASHLIGHT.

07:19.050 --> 07:20.324
- ALL RIGHT, DOC, LISTEN,

07:20.440 --> 07:22.249
BOTTOM LINE--
DO WE, OR DON'T WE?

07:22.370 --> 07:25.749
- YOU KNOW,
IF MAX WANTS TO TRY THIS,

07:25.850 --> 07:27.852
WHY DON'T YOU
FOLLOW HIS LEAD, HMM?

07:27.960 --> 07:30.713
- ALL RIGHT.
- ARE YOU KIDDING?

07:30.820 --> 07:32.617
HE'S NEVER DONE THIS BEFORE.

07:32.720 --> 07:33.709
- AND I UNDERSTAND,

07:33.830 --> 07:35.513
AND YOUR CONCERNS
ARE COMPLETELY VALID.

07:35.620 --> 07:38.066
BUT IF MAX IS TRULY MOTIVATED
TO TRY THIS,

07:38.180 --> 07:41.343
THAT'S AN OPPORTUNITY
THAT YOU DON'T WANT TO PASS BY.

07:41.460 --> 07:44.588
I THINK THE KEY TO THIS
IS PREPARATION.

07:44.700 --> 07:47.351
PREVIEW FOR MAX AS MUCH
AS YOU POSSIBLY CAN.

07:47.460 --> 07:50.736
LET HIM KNOW EXACTLY WHAT
HE'S GOING TO BE GETTING INTO

07:50.840 --> 07:52.842
AHEAD OF TIME.
- ALL RIGHT.

07:52.950 --> 07:53.939
- KEEP IT SMALL.

07:54.050 --> 07:57.702
I THINK, PROBABLY BEST
JUST THE THREE OF YOU...

07:57.820 --> 07:59.981
THIS YEAR.
- ALL RIGHT.

08:00.100 --> 08:01.647
- GREAT.

08:01.750 --> 08:03.923
- LET'S GO FOR IT--
COME ON--AS A FAMILY.

08:04.030 --> 08:06.954
- OKAY.
- OKAY, IT'S GONNA BE GREAT.

08:07.070 --> 08:08.890
- ALL RIGHT.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.969
WE'RE GONNA GO
TRICK-OR-TREATING.

08:12.070 --> 08:13.697
- THANK YOU.

08:13.800 --> 08:16.906
- THIS PLACE IS AMAZING.

08:17.010 --> 08:19.934
OOH, I CAN PUT
A VEGETABLE GARDEN OUT THERE.

08:20.050 --> 08:22.427
- NO, YOU DON'T WANT TO PUT
A VEGETABLE GARDEN.

08:22.530 --> 08:24.942
- YEAH, I DO.
- NO, 'CAUSE THEN IT'LL JUST--

08:25.050 --> 08:26.802
THE DOG WILL RUN THROUGH IT
AND MESS IT ALL UP,

08:26.920 --> 08:29.115
AND THEN WE'LL HAVE
TO CLEAN IT ALL UP.

08:29.230 --> 08:31.607
- WHAT DOG?
- A DOG.

08:31.710 --> 08:33.951
YOU KNOW, YOU--YOU--
A NEW PLACE,

08:34.060 --> 08:37.712
A BIG--BIG LAB MAYBE
NAMED MARLEY OR SOMETHING.

08:37.820 --> 08:40.061
- YEAH, I DON'T--I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT,

08:40.170 --> 08:41.444
BECAUSE I'M A CAT PERSON.

08:41.550 --> 08:43.063
- GRODY.
YOU'RE A CAT PERSON?

08:43.170 --> 08:44.922
- YEAH.
- CATS SUCK.

08:45.040 --> 08:46.200
TH EY'RE ALWAYS
LICKING THEMSELVES.

08:46.310 --> 08:48.938
THEY'RE NARCISSISTIC.
THEY'RE KIND OF O.C.D.

08:49.040 --> 08:52.168
DOGS ARE WAY BETTER.
WE GOT TO GET A DOG.

08:54.110 --> 08:55.873
_ "WE"?

08:55.980 --> 08:56.730
- HMM?

08:56.840 --> 08:59.491
- YOU JUST SAID "WE."

08:59.600 --> 09:00.771
YOU SAID WE SHOULD--

09:00.880 --> 09:01.915
- NO, I SAID--
- "WE GOT TO GET A DOG."

09:02.020 --> 09:03.806
- I SAID
YOU GOT TO GET A DOG.

09:03.920 --> 09:06.775
- NO, I'M PRETTY SURE
I HEARD YOU SAY "WE."

09:06.890 --> 09:08.460
- HMM, I DON'T THINK SO.

09:08.580 --> 09:10.548
I THINK I SAID "YOU,"

09:10.650 --> 09:13.687
MEANING YOU AND JABBAR,
SHOULD GET A...

09:13.790 --> 09:16.645
WHAT'S HAPPENING
BEHIND THIS DOOR?

09:17.900 --> 09:21.939
- YOU SAID, "WE,"
WEIRDO.

09:22.040 --> 09:23.109
[sighs]

09:23.210 --> 09:24.723
- OKAY, MAX,
I WANT YOU TO LOOK AT THIS.

09:24.840 --> 09:26.796
THIS IS A BALL, BUT IT'S REALLY,
ON HALLOWEEN NIGHT,

09:26.910 --> 09:28.525
GOING TO BE A JACK-O'-LANTERN

09:28.630 --> 09:29.858
FILLED WITH FIRE
AND CANDLES, OKAY?

09:29.980 --> 09:31.948
AND THERE'S GONNA BE
PEOPLE AROUND, LOUD NOISES--

09:32.050 --> 09:33.039
- WELL, THE THING--
THE THING--

09:33.150 --> 09:34.390
- PEOPLE ARE GONNA BE--
- I DON'T GET IT!

09:34.500 --> 09:35.842
I DON'T GET IT.
I DON'T WANT A TRICK.

09:35.950 --> 09:37.679
SO SHOULDN'T
I JUST SAY "TREAT,"

09:37.780 --> 09:38.917
OR JUST, LIKE,
"GIVE ME CANDY"?

09:39.020 --> 09:40.908
- WELL, YEAH, BUT, HONEY,
I DIDN'T MAKE UP THE RULES.

09:41.020 --> 09:43.261
I JUST KNOW WHAT IT TAKES
TO GET A MINI-SNICKERS OR--

09:43.370 --> 09:44.780
- BUT WHAT IF SOMEONE
GIVES ME AN ALMOND JOY?

09:44.890 --> 09:46.232
DO I HAVE TO TAKE IT?

09:46.340 --> 09:47.921
- WELL, YEAH, YOU TAKE IT,
AND YOU'RE POLITE ABOUT IT,

09:48.030 --> 09:50.260
BUT YOU CAN BRING IT HOME,
AND MAYBE DAD'LL EAT IT.

09:50.380 --> 09:51.301
HE LIKES COCONUT.

09:51.410 --> 09:53.037
- COCONUT LOOKS LIKE
THE SALIVA

09:53.140 --> 09:55.756
AN AMBUSH BUG SECRETES
IN ORDER TO IMMOBILIZE ITS PREY.

09:55.870 --> 09:57.758
IT'S DISGUSTING--
WHO WOULD WANT TO EAT SALIVA

09:57.870 --> 09:59.588
IN ORDER ORDER TO IMMOBILIZE--
- YOUR DAD.

09:59.700 --> 10:00.837
HE LOVES IT.
OKAY, NOW WE'RE HERE.

10:00.940 --> 10:02.100
KNOCK ON THE DOOR--

10:02.220 --> 10:04.359
OKAY, GO.
KNOCK.

10:04.460 --> 10:05.666
THERE'S NO DOORBELL,
SO WHEN THAT--

10:05.770 --> 10:06.873
JUST KNOCK, HARD.

10:06.980 --> 10:09.528
THERE MIGHT BE
AN "OLD PERSON" INSIDE.

10:09.640 --> 10:10.777
THAT'S GOOD.

10:10.880 --> 10:12.848
OKAY, AND WE STEP BACK.
THAT'S GOOD. THAT'S GOOD.

10:12.950 --> 10:15.123
- OH, HAPPY HALLOW'S EVE.

10:15.230 --> 10:17.050
- OH, HI, OLD LADY.

10:17.160 --> 10:19.025
- WHAT A CUTE COSTUME.
WHAT ARE YOU?

10:19.130 --> 10:21.098
- WHAT DO YOU SAY?

10:21.200 --> 10:22.121
- THANK YOU.

10:22.240 --> 10:23.639
- NO, YOU DON'T
SAY "THANK YOU" YET.

10:23.760 --> 10:26.581
YOU SAY...

10:26.690 --> 10:28.419
TRICK OR TREAT!
ARGH!

10:28.520 --> 10:29.828
- OHH.
OOH, SCARY!

10:29.930 --> 10:30.931
TAKE A PIECE OF CANDY.

10:31.040 --> 10:32.723
- THANK YOU.
I LOVE NECCO WAFERS.

10:32.830 --> 10:34.001
WE PUT THIS IN THE BAG,

10:34.110 --> 10:35.338
AND WE DON'T EAT IT
TILL WE GET HOME,

10:35.460 --> 10:36.791
'CAUSE I HAVE TO CHECK IT.
- JUST THE ONE PIECE.

10:36.910 --> 10:39.003
YOUNG MAN, WOULD YOU
LIKE A CANDY PIECE?

10:39.120 --> 10:41.008
- WHAT DO YOU SAY?
- THANK YOU.

10:41.120 --> 10:42.189
- NO, YOU SAY--

10:42.290 --> 10:43.871
- MAX, IF YOU DON'T SAY,
"TRICK OR TREAT,"

10:43.980 --> 10:45.459
I CAN'T GIVE YOU CANDY.

10:45.570 --> 10:46.946
- BUT EVEN IF I SAY,
"TRICK OR TREAT,"

10:47.060 --> 10:48.561
IT'S NOT REALLY HALLOWEEN,
SO I WON'T GET CANDY.

10:48.680 --> 10:50.989
AND EVEN IF IT WAS HALLOWEEN,
THERE'S NOTHING IN THAT BOWL.

10:51.090 --> 10:52.603
- IT'S TRUE. WE'RE PRETENDING.
- IT'S JUST AIR.

10:52.720 --> 10:54.927
- EXCEPT
YOU'RE PRACTICING, OKAY?

10:55.030 --> 10:56.054
- THERE'S NOTHING
IN THIS BOWL.

10:56.170 --> 10:57.819
- DOES ANYONE ELSE
HAVE TO PRACTICE?

10:57.930 --> 10:59.204
- NO.
- DID YOU?

10:59.310 --> 11:00.618
- NO.
- WHY ARE YOU MAKING ME PRACTICE

11:00.720 --> 11:02.062
WHEN NO ONE ELSE
HAS TO PRACTICE?

11:02.170 --> 11:04.513
- IT'S JUST BECAUSE
WE'RE PRACT ICING, MAX.

11:04.620 --> 11:06.440
- TEN STICKERS!
- YOU GET ONE STICKER,

11:06.560 --> 11:07.697
AND THAT'S ENOUGH.

11:09.010 --> 11:10.728
- SORRY, MOM.
I JUST--

11:10.840 --> 11:12.558
I NEVER KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

11:12.670 --> 11:14.114
I TRIED.

11:16.980 --> 11:19.153
- IT'S GONNA BE GREAT.

11:19.260 --> 11:22.149
- OKAY, THIS--THIS IS
WHAT WE NEED TO GET VERIFIED--

11:22.260 --> 11:24.956
- HEY! TURNS OUT
THE BERKELEY COFFEE NEAR ME

11:25.060 --> 11:26.743
IS THE BERKELEY COFFEE
NEAR YOU.

11:26.850 --> 11:29.671
I KISSED MY BOSS.

11:33.000 --> 11:34.308
- EXCUSE US.
THANK YOU.

11:34.410 --> 11:35.923
- HI. LATTE?

11:36.040 --> 11:38.508
- HMM.
- AND COME IN.

11:38.620 --> 11:39.996
- JULIA, I'M SURE YOU HAVE

11:40.110 --> 11:41.862
A MILLION MORE
IMPORTANT THINGS TO DO,

11:41.970 --> 11:44.029
BUT I'M IN THE PROCESS
OF RUINING MY FUTURE.

11:44.150 --> 11:45.412
CAN YOU HELP?

11:45.530 --> 11:47.623
OH, HERE, UH, ERIC IN ACCOUNTING
USUALLY GETS SOMETHING GOOD.

11:47.740 --> 11:49.662
- OKAY, YOU KISSED GORDON?

11:49.770 --> 11:51.249
- YES, I DID.
- HOW--HOW--

11:51.360 --> 11:52.463
- MY BOSS, ADAM'S BOSS,

11:52.570 --> 11:54.879
THE BOSS, YOU KNOW?
HE WAS SEXY AND APPEALING.

11:54.990 --> 11:56.673
AND HE'S GOT THE HAIR
THAT'S, LIKE, SLICKED BACK,

11:56.780 --> 11:58.190
EXCEPT FOR WHEN
IT FLOPS FORWARD.

11:58.300 --> 11:59.506
- OH, SARAH...

11:59.610 --> 12:00.918
- I WAS POWERLESS
TO STOP MYSELF.

12:01.030 --> 12:02.156
HE MADE ME FEEL SMART.

12:02.270 --> 12:04.090
HE MADE ME FEEL LIKE
I WAS DOING A GOOD JOB.

12:04.200 --> 12:06.543
HE--HE MADE ME FEEL LIKE,
FOR A MINUTE,

12:06.650 --> 12:08.515
MAYBE I COULD BE
WITH THE SUCCESSFUL,

12:08.620 --> 12:09.757
GOOD-LOOKING GUY.

12:09.860 --> 12:11.168
- YOU CAN.
- NO, I CAN'T, JULIA.

12:11.280 --> 12:13.339
- YES, YOU CAN.
- NO, THOSE GUYS LIKE YOU, OKAY?

12:13.450 --> 12:15.657
THEY--THEY WILL KISS ME
IN THE PARKING LOT

12:15.760 --> 12:17.102
AND THEN NEVER CALL ME.

12:17.210 --> 12:19.075
- OH, MY GOD.

12:19.180 --> 12:21.000
I'M SORRY.

12:24.050 --> 12:26.769
- I SAW HIM AT WORK TODAY.

12:26.880 --> 12:28.973
HE IGNORED ME.

12:31.260 --> 12:33.364
- OKAY,
I-I HATE TO QUOTE MOM HERE,

12:33.470 --> 12:35.529
BUT, YOU KNOW, WHAT
SHE TOLD US IN HIGH SCHOOL.

12:35.650 --> 12:37.880
- UM...

12:37.990 --> 12:39.673
YOU CAN GET PREGNANT
IN A HOT TUB

12:39.790 --> 12:41.542
EVEN IF YOU DON'T HAVE SEX?

12:41.650 --> 12:42.958
- WHAT?
- HMM?

12:43.070 --> 12:44.446
OH.
- SHE SAID THAT?

12:44.550 --> 12:45.960
- MAYBE WE GOT
DIFFERENT TALKS.

12:46.070 --> 12:48.129
WHAT DID SHE SAY TO YOU?
- SHE SAID, "BOYS ARE DUMB."

12:48.250 --> 12:49.103
- OH, THAT ONE.

12:49.210 --> 12:50.723
YES, BOYS ARE DUMB...
[knock on door]

12:50.830 --> 12:52.036
WELL, ESPECIALLY
THE ONES I PICK.

12:52.150 --> 12:54.289
- ONE MINUTE, PLEASE.
THANK YOU.

12:54.390 --> 12:55.766
BOYS ARE DUMB. OKAY?

12:55.870 --> 12:58.077
IT'S NOT YOU.
IT'S NOT, OKAY?

12:58.190 --> 13:00.909
- I CAN'T EVER SHOW
MY FACE THERE AGAIN.

13:01.020 --> 13:02.840
[chuckles]
I ACT ED LIKE AN IDIOT.

13:02.950 --> 13:04.770
- WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO

13:04.880 --> 13:07.257
IS GO BACK IN THERE
WITH YOUR HEAD HELD HIGH.

13:07.370 --> 13:10.191
AND YOU'RE GONNA GIVE
ERIC IN ACCOUNTING HIS LATTE.

13:10.300 --> 13:11.198
- NO.
- YES.

13:11.300 --> 13:12.927
YOU'RE GONNA HOLD
YOUR HEAD HIGH.

13:13.030 --> 13:14.429
- NO.
- LET'S--LET'S DO THIS.

13:14.550 --> 13:17.337
- AND YOU'RE NOT GONNA LET THAT
JERK RUIN YOUR CAREER, OKAY?

13:17.450 --> 13:18.587
- [laughs]
MY CAREER.

13:20.210 --> 13:22.997
AND, UH, DON'T REALLY
HAVE A CAREER.

13:23.110 --> 13:25.658
- THIS IS YOUR SHOT.
TAKE IT.

13:25.770 --> 13:27.909
OKAY?

13:28.010 --> 13:30.171
- YOU'RE RIGHT.
- OKAY.

13:30.290 --> 13:32.667
- [sighs] OKAY.
- OKAY.

13:32.770 --> 13:34.180
HEAD UP.

13:34.290 --> 13:35.211
- THANKS, DUDE.

13:35.330 --> 13:37.946
- YEAH, DUDE.
- SORRY. HI. SORRY.

13:39.300 --> 13:40.983
- HELLO.
COME IN.

13:45.650 --> 13:47.572
- ALL RIGHT, LET ME--
LET ME TAKE YOU BACK HERE.

13:47.680 --> 13:48.999
FOCUS, OKAY.

13:49.100 --> 13:51.159
LET ME TAKE YOU BACK
TO THE BEGINNING ON THIS.

13:51.270 --> 13:53.989
IN 1963, I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU KNOW THIS...

13:54.100 --> 13:56.239
- OH, I LOVE THIS STORY.
- BUT THE UNITED STATES

13:56.350 --> 13:58.272
PASSED AN AMENDMENT
TO THE FAIR LABOR STANDARDS ACT

13:58.380 --> 14:01.076
THAT GAVE WOMEN EQUALITY
IN THE WORKPLACE.

14:01.180 --> 14:03.239
THAT'S--THAT'S SO EXCITING.

14:03.350 --> 14:05.659
THAT WAS PROGRESS.
THAT WAS...

14:05.770 --> 14:08.455
IMPORTANT AND--
AND THIS...

14:08.570 --> 14:10.117
IS--IS JUST KIND OF...

14:10.220 --> 14:12.108
- I LIKE IT
BECAUSE IT'S PINK,

14:12.230 --> 14:13.800
AND THAT'S
MY FAVORITE COLOR.

14:13.920 --> 14:15.876
- THAT'S TRUE.
- YEAH.

14:15.990 --> 14:18.879
BUT IT KIND OF--
IT GOES AGAINST EVERYTHING

14:18.990 --> 14:21.811
THAT--THAT WE AS WOMEN
HAVE BEEN STRUGGLING AGAINST

14:21.930 --> 14:23.022
FOR THE LAST 50 YEARS.

14:23.130 --> 14:25.405
YOU KNOW, IT'S...

14:25.510 --> 14:27.922
IT'S, UH--IT'S. ..

14:28.030 --> 14:31.204
- IT'S WAY TOO COLD
TO BE WEARING THAT IN OCTOBER.

14:31.310 --> 14:33.585
I MEAN, LOOK-IT, THERE'S, LIKE,
NO SLEEVES ON THAT, HON.

14:33.700 --> 14:35.349
- MISS CALIFORNIA
WEARS A FUR COAT.

14:35.460 --> 14:36.836
I'LL WEAR THAT.

14:36.940 --> 14:38.908
- I CAN'T--I CAN'T...

14:39.010 --> 14:40.489
ARGUE WITH...

14:40.600 --> 14:43.489
- I REALLY, REALLY, REALLY,
REALLY, REALLY, REALLY WANT IT.

14:43.600 --> 14:45.591
- UM, I'M GONNA DISCUSS IT
WITH YOUR FATHER.

14:45.710 --> 14:46.847
- FUR COAT.
[chuckles]

14:46.950 --> 14:48.110
- DID SHE--
SHE SAID FUR COAT.

14:48.230 --> 14:49.367
- YEAH.
- THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID?

14:49.470 --> 14:51.529
THAT'S...

14:51.640 --> 14:53.505
I FAILED HER, JOEL.

14:53.610 --> 14:56.022
- AND WHEN IT'S MY TURN
TO BE STUDENT OF THE WEEK,

14:56.130 --> 14:59.577
I GET TO BRING MARVIN HOME
FOR THE WHOLE WEEKEND.

14:59.690 --> 15:01.442
- WHAT EXACTLY IS MARVIN?

15:01.550 --> 15:03.962
- OKAY, HE'S THIS BIG.
HE HAS SCALES.

15:04.070 --> 15:06.174
- OH, HE HAS SCALES?

15:06.280 --> 15:08.657
- WELL, ONE OF THE PLACES
WE SAW...

15:08.760 --> 15:12.173
HAS A GREAT PLAY ROOM
THAT I'M SURE MARVIN WOULD LOVE.

15:12.290 --> 15:14.008
- YOU STILL THINKING
ABOUT THAT ONE...

15:14.120 --> 15:15.599
WITH THE SMELL?
- YEAH.

15:15.700 --> 15:17.565
- THAT ONE?
- WHAT SMELL?

15:17.670 --> 15:20.184
- YOU KNOW, THAT FUNKY SMELL.
IT'S KIND OF HARD TO DESCRIBE.

15:20.290 --> 15:22.155
IT WAS LIKE CANNED SOUP
OR SOMETHING.

15:22.260 --> 15:23.807
BUDDY, YOU WANT TO LIVE
IN A PLACE

15:23.920 --> 15:25.467
THAT SMELLS LIKE BROCCOLI SOUP?
- NUH-UH.

15:25.570 --> 15:28.573
- YEAH, WHO WOULD?

15:28.680 --> 15:31.956
- HEY, JABBAR, I HEAR
THE, UH, SAILBOAT ON THE CORNER

15:32.060 --> 15:34.403
IS DECORATED LIKE
A PIRATE SHIP FOR HALLOWEEN.

15:34.510 --> 15:35.920
OHH...

15:36.030 --> 15:38.419
I BET YOU IF YOU GO ON DECK,
YOU CAN SEE IT.

15:38.520 --> 15:40.681
- OKAY.
- ARR!

15:40.800 --> 15:43.200
ARR! ARR!

15:43.320 --> 15:45.584
- BUT STAY ON THE DECK, OKAY?
- OKAY.

15:49.290 --> 15:51.008
- ALL RIGHT.
WHAT'S GOING ON?

15:51.120 --> 15:53.008
- HMM?
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

15:53.120 --> 15:56.226
- WELL, WHAT'S GOING ON
IS I DON'T LIKE THAT PLACE.

15:56.330 --> 15:58.298
I THINK IT'S STANDARD
AND BORING.

15:58.400 --> 15:59.503
- I LIKE IT.

15:59.610 --> 16:01.157
IT'S CLOSE TO THE BART.
IT'S CONVENIENT.

16:01.270 --> 16:03.431
- WELL, I THOUGHT YOU LIKED
THE PLACE WITH THE GARDEN.

16:03.540 --> 16:04.507
- I DO, I DO.

16:04.610 --> 16:06.407
BUT IT'S, LIKE,
$500 MORE THAN I CAN AFFORD.

16:06.510 --> 16:08.193
- WELL, I DON'T WANT YOU
TO MAKE A DECISION

16:08.310 --> 16:10.449
YOU'RE GONNA REGRET,
YOU KNOW.

16:14.930 --> 16:17.444
THE PLACE WITH THE GARDEN
IS SO MUCH...

16:17.560 --> 16:18.481
NICER.

16:18.590 --> 16:20.239
- WELL...

16:20.350 --> 16:23.353
IT'S--IT'S MY DECISION
TO MAKE.

16:23.460 --> 16:25.189
IT'S MY PLACE...

16:25.290 --> 16:26.325
RIGHT?

16:28.430 --> 16:30.352
- YEAH, RIGHT.

16:38.750 --> 16:41.059
- I'M GONNA GO CHECK ON HIM.

16:45.590 --> 16:46.784
[knock on door]

16:46.900 --> 16:48.162
- HEY.
- HEY.

16:48.280 --> 16:49.793
- GOT A MINUTE?
- I GOT A CONFERENCE CALL.

16:49.900 --> 16:51.959
UH, YOU KNOW WHAT?
NEVER MIND.

16:52.080 --> 16:54.139
COME ON IN.
I-I'VE GOT A MINUTE.

16:54.250 --> 16:56.138
- [clears throat]
- WHAT'S DOING?

16:56.250 --> 16:57.592
- THESE ARE THE SPECS
YOU ASKED FOR.

16:57.700 --> 16:59.213
WE WENT OVER THEM,
AND I THINK YOU'LL BE PLEASED.

16:59.320 --> 17:02.904
- TERRIFIC. GREAT.

17:03.020 --> 17:04.112
WHAT ELSE?

17:04.230 --> 17:06.425
- UH, JUST QUICKLY,
I WAS WONDERING, UH,

17:06.540 --> 17:08.258
IF BOB INGOMAR'S ORDER
CAME IN YET,

17:08.370 --> 17:09.701
YOU KNOW,
FROM THE CONVENTION.

17:09.820 --> 17:11.151
HE JUST SEEMED PLEASED--

17:11.270 --> 17:13.295
- SARAH, THAT'S
NOT HOW IT WORKS.

17:13.410 --> 17:16.379
IT'S A PROCESS--
NEGOTIATIONS, YOU KNOW.

17:16.480 --> 17:18.232
IT'S NOT LIKE IT HAPPENS
ALL OF A SUDDEN, POOF,

17:18.340 --> 17:19.307
THE VERY NEXT DAY.

17:19.410 --> 17:20.968
- OF COURSE, YEAH.
DUH.

17:21.070 --> 17:22.378
- BUT AS SOON AS THERE'S
SOMETHING TO REPORT,

17:22.480 --> 17:23.481
YOU'LL BE THE FIRST TO KNOW,

17:23.590 --> 17:25.137
WHEN I SEND OUT
THE COMPANY-WIDE MEMO.

17:25.250 --> 17:27.514
- OKAY. THAN KS.

17:30.350 --> 17:32.910
I'M SORRY, UM, BUT...

17:33.010 --> 17:35.319
AFTER EVERYTHING
YOU SAID TO ME...

17:35.430 --> 17:38.638
REALLY?
THE COM PANY-WIDE MEMO?

17:38.740 --> 17:40.674
- I'M CONFUSED.
IS--IS THERE A PROBLEM?

17:40.780 --> 17:43.328
- NO, I JUST FEEL LIKE
YOU'RE--YOU'RE BEING WEIRD.

17:43.440 --> 17:44.884
- I'M--I'M RUNNING
MY COMPANY.

17:44.990 --> 17:47.094
- YES, BUT WE KISSED.

17:50.310 --> 17:52.335
- WE KISSED, YEAH.
- IN A PARKING LOT.

17:52.450 --> 17:54.133
- YEAH, AND IT WAS FANTASTIC.

17:54.240 --> 17:55.787
- AND NOW...

17:55.900 --> 17:57.208
- NOW...

17:57.310 --> 17:59.995
YOU WANT TO KNOW
WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN NEXT?

18:00.110 --> 18:01.793
- NO, PLEASE.

18:01.900 --> 18:03.276
YEAH, SORT OF.

18:03.390 --> 18:05.358
- AND YOU'D LIKE TO TALK
ABOUT IT RIGHT NOW?

18:05.460 --> 18:08.281
- NO, NO, NO.
I-I DON'T KNOW.

18:08.390 --> 18:10.005
- SARAH, LOOK, I--

18:10.120 --> 18:12.975
I THINK YOU'RE A WONDERFUL,
LOVELY WOMAN.

18:13.090 --> 18:14.603
- OKAY. [chuckles]
NEVER MIND. FORGET IT.

18:14.710 --> 18:15.495
NO, THAT'S OKAY.

18:15.610 --> 18:17.009
- NO, NO, NO.
WAIT, WAIT. HEAR ME OUT.

18:17.130 --> 18:18.222
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

18:18.330 --> 18:19.570
YOU KNOW, I'VE GOT
A CONFERENCE CALL

18:19.680 --> 18:21.648
THAT I'M THREE MINUTES LATE FOR,
AND, YOU KNOW, TO BE HONEST...

18:21.750 --> 18:23.024
- PLEASE BE HONEST.

18:23.130 --> 18:25.052
- BE HONEST.
UM...

18:25.170 --> 18:27.616
WE HAVE VERY DIFFERENT
LIFESTYLES.

18:27.720 --> 18:28.516
- WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

18:28.620 --> 18:31.919
- THAT MEANS THAT, UH,
YOU HAVE KIDS,

18:32.040 --> 18:34.417
AND I HAVE A BOAT.

18:34.520 --> 18:36.488
- HAVING A BOAT
IS A LIFESTYLE?

18:36.590 --> 18:38.171
- WE'RE ACTING LIKE TEENAGERS.

18:38.280 --> 18:40.521
- NO, NO, NO, MAYBE I'M NOT
TEENAGER ENOUGH FOR YOU.

18:40.630 --> 18:42.211
- WELL, YOU KNOW,
THAT'S NOT FAIR.

18:42.320 --> 18:43.560
HEY, PLEASE.
SARAH, PLEASE.

18:43.670 --> 18:44.830
- OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU'RE RIGHT.

18:44.950 --> 18:46.144
I'M SORRY.
LET'S FORGET IT.

18:46.260 --> 18:48.148
LET'S FORGET THE WHOLE THING
EVER HAPPENED.

18:48.260 --> 18:50.364
I REALLY LIKE MY JOB.
THAT'S WHAT MATTERS.

18:50.470 --> 18:51.630
LET'S JUST FORGET IT.

18:51.750 --> 18:53.058
- I...
- I'M FINE.

18:53.160 --> 18:55.196
I'LL WAIT FOR THE MEMO.

18:56.890 --> 18:59.404
[door closes]

18:59.510 --> 19:01.649
- WELL, I TRUST
THAT YOUR FATHER

19:01.760 --> 19:03.159
HAS EXPLAINED TO YOU

19:03.280 --> 19:06.852
THE IMPORTANCE
OF THE BRAVERMAN HALLOWEEN.

19:06.970 --> 19:08.483
- [imitates plane crashing]

19:08.590 --> 19:10.763
- I MEAN, SURE,
IT'S ABOUT DECORATING THE YARD

19:10.870 --> 19:15.148
AND SCARING THE HELL OUT OF
THE OBNOXIOUS NEIGHBOR TWITS.

19:17.390 --> 19:20.905
BUT IT'S A LOT
MORE THAN THAT, REALLY...

19:21.020 --> 19:22.396
TO ME.

19:22.500 --> 19:24.149
- [imitates airplane engine]

19:24.260 --> 19:27.639
- HALLOWEEN
WAS THE LAST HOLIDAY

19:27.750 --> 19:29.399
THAT YOUR GRANDMOTHER AND I
GOT TO SPEND TOGETHER

19:29.510 --> 19:32.365
BEFORE I SHIPPED
OFF TO BASIC.

19:32.480 --> 19:35.096
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS?

19:35.200 --> 19:37.509
ARMY TRAINING.

19:37.620 --> 19:41.545
FORT BENNING, GEORGIA--
AH, THERE'S A TOTAL HELLHOLE.

19:43.380 --> 19:45.962
THAT'S A STORY
FOR ANOTHER TIME, YEAH.

19:47.700 --> 19:50.487
THE POINT IS THAT CAMILLE
AND I SPENT THAT HALLOWEEN

19:50.600 --> 19:55.116
LIKE IT WAS CHRISTMAS,
NEW YEAR'S, AND EASTER...

19:55.220 --> 19:56.847
ALL WRAPPED UP TOGETHER.

19:59.540 --> 20:01.940
OH, MAX, WE HAD A TIME.

20:05.200 --> 20:07.293
SO I MISSED
A FEW HOLIDAYS AFTER THAT,

20:07.410 --> 20:10.129
BUT, SEE, I ALWAYS HAD...

20:10.240 --> 20:14.586
THE MEMORY OF THAT HALLOWEEN.

20:14.690 --> 20:18.103
AND THAT'S WHY IT'S SPECIAL.

20:18.210 --> 20:19.438
HERE YOU GO.

20:19.560 --> 20:22.597
- WHAT IS IT?
- FOR YOU.

20:24.110 --> 20:26.112
YOUR GRANDMA
MADE IT FOR YOU.

20:26.220 --> 20:29.144
YOUR DAD HAS ONE JUST LIKE IT,
HADDIE TOO.

20:29.260 --> 20:30.739
NOW YOU GOT ONE.

20:30.850 --> 20:32.659
- DO YOU THINK I'LL BE ABLE
TO GET ENOUGH CANDY TO FILL IT?

20:32.780 --> 20:35.567
- OH, MAX, WE ARE SURE
AS HELL GONNA TRY.

20:35.680 --> 20:37.841
- I'M GONNA GO TEST OUT
HOW MUCH IT CAN FIT.

20:37.960 --> 20:40.292
- HEY, BUD.

20:47.690 --> 20:48.611
- OKAY, WE'VE GOT THE EHRINS,

20:48.730 --> 20:50.129
THE HENDERSONS,
AND THE CARPENTERS.

20:50.240 --> 20:51.480
THEY'RE ALL ON BOARD
TO USE THE SAFETY STICKS

20:51.590 --> 20:52.659
FOR THEIR JACK-O'-LANTERNS.

20:52.760 --> 20:53.795
- GREAT, AND I SPOKE
WITH THE GUGGENHEIMS,

20:53.900 --> 20:54.650
SO THAT'S TAKEN CARE OF.

20:54.770 --> 20:55.862
- PERFECT, UH-HUH.
- ALL RIGHT?

20:55.970 --> 20:56.902
- GREAT.
- AWESOME.

20:57.010 --> 20:58.318
- AWESOME.
GOOD JOB.

20:58.420 --> 20:59.421
HEY, LOOK AT THAT DOG.

20:59.530 --> 21:02.636
- HUH. AW, HI.
LOOK HOW CUTE YOU ARE.

21:02.740 --> 21:03.661

21:03.770 --> 21:05.158

21:05.260 --> 21:06.488

21:08.260 --> 21:11.297

THE CORNER HERE, ON SYCAMORE...

21:11.400 --> 21:12.640
- OKAY.
- OH.

21:12.750 --> 21:14.297
- THE ONE WITH THE DOGHOUSE
IN THE FRONT...

21:14.410 --> 21:16.401
- PERFECT.
- MORGAN'S HEADQUARTERS.

21:16.510 --> 21:18.683
- I LOVE, LOVE,
LOVE SYCAMORE.

21:18.790 --> 21:19.757
WOW, ARE YOU CUTE.

21:21.000 --> 21:23.309
AND JUST--WE'RE PASSING
THESE OUT TO NEIGHBORS

21:23.420 --> 21:24.489
TO MAYBE PUT IN THEIR
JACK-O'-LANTERNS THIS YEAR

21:24.590 --> 21:25.796
INSTEAD OF CANDLES.

21:25.900 --> 21:27.447
- MY SON'S AER-IND OF FIRE.

21:27.560 --> 21:29.516
- YEAH, WE HAVE ORANGE,
AND WE HAVE YELLOW.

21:29.630 --> 21:31.177
- YEAH.
- HE HAS ASPERGER'S.

21:31.290 --> 21:32.837
AND I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY HE
WANTS TO GO TRICK-OR-TREATING.

21:32.940 --> 21:34.555
- OKAY.
- BUT HE JUST WANTS TO GO.

21:34.670 --> 21:35.830
SO IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND
PUTTING THESE

21:35.940 --> 21:37.828
IN YOUR JACK-O'-LANTERN
INSTEAD OF...

21:37.950 --> 21:41.249
- YEAH, I-I COULD PUT 'EM
IN THE PUMPKIN.

21:41.360 --> 21:42.497
THEY'RE OKAY FOR THE DOG?

21:42.610 --> 21:43.497
- EVEN BETTER FOR THE DOG.

21:43.610 --> 21:44.531
- YEAH?
- YEAH.

21:44.640 --> 21:46.016
- IT'S NOT FIRE.

21:46.130 --> 21:47.199

21:47.300 --> 21:49.222

21:49.340 --> 21:50.477
- OKAY, DADDY-O.

21:50.580 --> 21:52.548
HONEY, I DON'T KNOW
HOW WE'RE GONNA DO ALL THIS.

21:52.650 --> 21:54.163
THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE. THERE'S A
HOUSE OVER THERE THAT I DON'T--

21:54.270 --> 21:55.919
- CAN WE JUST PAUSE FOR A SECOND
AND NOTE THE ABSURDITY

21:56.030 --> 21:58.271
OF TRYING TO COMPLETELY REMOVE
FIRE FROM HALLOWEEN?

21:58.380 --> 21:59.654
- OKAY, WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?

21:59.760 --> 22:01.170
LET'S STAY HOME, THEN.
WELL PLAY MONOPOLY AGAIN.

22:01.280 --> 22:02.133

AND SHE AND JOEL

22:04.660 --> 22:06.389

22:06.490 --> 22:08.526
AND THEN CROSBY GOT WIND OF IT,
SO THEY'RE GONNA COME OVER TOO.

22:08.630 --> 22:09.938
- HONEY, THEY CAN'T.

22:10.050 --> 22:12.518
DR. PELIKAN SPECIFICALLY SAID
TO KEEP THE GROUP SMALL.

22:12.640 --> 22:14.426
- YEAH, THEY'RE ALL TRYING
TO BE SUPPORTIVE OF MAX, OKAY?

22:14.540 --> 22:15.871
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO SAY?

22:15.980 --> 22:17.561
- ANYWAY, THE POINT IS
IS THAT MY WHOLE FAMILY'S

22:17.680 --> 22:18.772
GONNA GO, AND I JUST...

22:18.880 --> 22:21.053
I FEEL REALLY GUILTY
ABOUT NOT BEING THERE, YOU KNOW?

22:21.160 --> 22:22.718
EXCUSE ME.

22:22.820 --> 22:24.879
HELLO?
ARE YOU LISTENING TO ME, GUY?

22:24.990 --> 22:26.719
- UM, YES, YES.

22:26.820 --> 22:28.924
OKAY, YOUR FAMILY HAS SOME
PSYCHOTIC LOVE OF HALLOWEEN.

22:29.030 --> 22:32.067
- THAT'S WHAT I SAID.
- IN OTHER NEWS...

22:32.170 --> 22:33.614
- OH. JOY.

22:33.730 --> 22:36.278
HOWARD HAS INVITED US
TO A FRAT PARTY.

22:36.380 --> 22:38.450
THAT'S...
- AWESOME?

22:38.560 --> 22:39.629
- SO EXCITING.
- AWESOME, YES.

22:39.730 --> 22:41.459
- WHERE IS IT?
- IT'S ACROSS THE BAY.

22:41.560 --> 22:43.175
AND IT'S GONNA BE INCREDIBLE.
- NO, WE'RE NOT GOING.

22:43.290 --> 22:44.496
- AND WE ARE TOTALLY GOING.

22:44.600 --> 22:45.999
- NO, WE'RE NOT GOING.
- SO, UM...

22:46.120 --> 22:48.634

TO A FRAT PARTY WITH HOWARD--NO.

22:48.740 --> 22:50.605
- YEAH. WHY DO YOU
SAY IT LIKE THAT?

22:50.710 --> 22:52.985
BECAUSE
IT'S GONNA BE AMAZING.

22:53.090 --> 22:54.739
- [sighs]

22:54.850 --> 22:56.158
- YOU KNOW HOW...

22:56.270 --> 22:59.603
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT...

22:59.720 --> 23:02.575
IT'S WRONG TO JUDGE PEOPLE BY
THE WAY THAT THEY LOOK, RIGHT?

23:02.690 --> 23:05.716
AND DO YOU KNOW HOW
BEAUTY CONTESTANTS ARE JUDGED?

23:05.830 --> 23:07.229
- MM...

23:07.350 --> 23:10.308
TALENT, SWIMSUIT,
AND INTERVIEW.

23:10.420 --> 23:11.933
- RIGHT.

23:16.180 --> 23:18.933
WELL, MOSTLY THEY'RE JUDGED
BY HOW THEY LOOK.

23:19.050 --> 23:21.325
- AND THAT'S WRONG, SO...

23:21.430 --> 23:24.706
ALL I'M SAYING IS WE DO STILL
HAVE YOUR LADYBUG COSTUME...

23:24.810 --> 23:27.085
YOU KNOW, IN--IN THE CASE
THAT YOU DECIDE

23:27.190 --> 23:31.331
YOU HAVE MORAL ISSUES
WITH WHAT YOU'RE WEARING.

23:31.440 --> 23:32.668
OKAY, UM, WHY DON'T WE--

23:32.790 --> 23:34.166
WHY DON'T WE JUST
PUT THIS ON, SWEETIE?

23:34.270 --> 23:35.476
LET'S SEE HOW IT LOOKS
WITH THE--

23:35.580 --> 23:37.719
WITH THE TIARA THING.

23:39.970 --> 23:41.039
- OKAY.

23:41.140 --> 23:42.755

THERE'S MY--
OKAY, LET'S TAKE A...

23:47.110 --> 23:50.034
EVEN WITH THE HAND.

23:50.150 --> 23:51.902
CHEESE.

23:52.010 --> 23:54.387
- THANK YOU.

23:54.500 --> 23:55.876

23:55.980 --> 23:59.086
AH, MARTINI FOR THE PANDA.

24:01.570 --> 24:04.050

24:04.160 --> 24:05.775
- HI.

24:05.890 --> 24:07.573
HI. WOW.

24:07.680 --> 24:09.500
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
- CAN YOU TALK?

24:09.620 --> 24:11.679
- UM, NOT REALLY.

24:11.790 --> 24:14.236
- I'LL HAVE A BEER.
- OKAY.

24:15.970 --> 24:17.653
- YOU'RE COMPLETELY RIGHT
ABOUT ME--

24:17.760 --> 24:19.728
EVERYTHING YOU SAID.

24:19.830 --> 24:21.764
- HUH?
- I ONLY DATE YOUNGER WOMEN.

24:21.870 --> 24:23.485
THE KID THING
WAS ALWAYS A DEAL BREAKER.

24:23.600 --> 24:25.556
AND THEN THERE'S THE FACT
THAT I AM YOUR BOSS.

24:25.670 --> 24:29.049
WE ARE A TERRIBLE IDEA.

24:29.150 --> 24:32.847
- WELL, THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR COMING HERE TO...

IT'S COMING, RIGHT? IT'S COMING.

38:01.550 --> 38:03.654
- YEAH, AND THERE'S NOT A
DAMN THING WE CAN DO TO STOP IT.

41:18.300 --> 41:20.916
I DON'T WANT TO LIVE
WITHOUT YOU.

41:29.720 --> 41:31.369

HOP UP ON YOUR KNEES.

41:31.480 --> 41:33.550
- WHY?

41:38.840 --> 41:39.864
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

41:39.980 --> 41:42.289

41:42.390 --> 41:45.837
WELL, NO,

41:48.810 --> 41:50.732

41:50.850 --> 41:52.704

41:52.820 --> 41:54.811
I'VE DONE SOME PRETTY AWESOME
THINGS IN MY LIFE--

41:54.920 --> 41:58.401
JUMPED HELICOPTERS,
THE SNAKE RIVER CANYON--

41:58.510 --> 42:00.262
BUT NOTHING
WOULD BE AS AWESOME

42:00.370 --> 42:03.021
AS MARRYING YOU.

42:03.140 --> 42:05.859
WILL YOU MARRY ME?
