01:38.890 --> 01:42.019
<i>Why do these
Hitchcock films stand up well?</i>

01:42.102 --> 01:43.854
<i>They don't look
old fashioned.</i>

01:45.564 --> 01:47.862
<i>Well, I don't know
the answer.</i>

01:59.286 --> 02:02.415
<i>That's true, yes.</i>

02:14.426 --> 02:16.554
<i>My dad
was a <i>big movie buff,</i></i>

02:16.637 --> 02:20.062
<i>and it was one of the books
that was in his library.</i>

02:24.269 --> 02:26.067
From the time I was
about seven years old,

02:26.146 --> 02:27.819
he knew I wanted
to make movies,

02:27.898 --> 02:29.946
so he recommended it to me.

02:31.276 --> 02:33.495
<i>And I remember
picking over it,</i>

02:33.570 --> 02:36.073
and I must've read it...
Sections of it.

02:36.156 --> 02:40.536
<i>Like, there's the Oskar Homolka
sequence from Sabotage.</i>

02:41.036 --> 02:44.757
Where it sort of lays out
all of the cutting pattern.

02:49.378 --> 02:51.756
It's not even a book anymore,

02:51.838 --> 02:54.387
it's like a stack of papers
because it was a...

02:54.466 --> 02:57.561
You know, I had a paperback
and it's just...

02:57.636 --> 02:59.889
You know, it's got
a rubber band around it.

03:01.014 --> 03:03.893
<i>In 1966, Frangois Truffaut</i>

03:03.975 --> 03:07.354
<i>published one of the few
indispensable books on movies.</i>

03:07.437 --> 03:12.364
<i>A series of conversations with
Alfred Hitchcock about his career,</i>

03:12.442 --> 03:13.443
<i>title by title.</i>

03:18.198 --> 03:22.419
It was a window into the world of
cinema that I hadn't had before,

03:22.494 --> 03:27.716
because it was a director simultaneously
talking about his own work,

03:27.791 --> 03:30.670
but doing so in a way that
was utterly unpretentious

03:30.752 --> 03:32.345
and had no pomposity.

03:38.719 --> 03:40.642
<i>There was starting to be</i>

03:40.721 --> 03:45.602
these kind of erudite
conversations about the art form.

03:45.976 --> 03:49.276
But Truffaut was the first
one where you really

03:50.939 --> 03:55.410
felt that, you know, they're
talking about the craft of it.

03:57.821 --> 04:00.199
That was incredibly
fascinating to me

04:00.282 --> 04:04.753
that these two people
from very different worlds

04:04.828 --> 04:06.501
<i>who were both
doing the same job,</i>

04:06.580 --> 04:08.833
<i>how they would
talk about things.</i>

04:21.970 --> 04:25.645
I think it
conclusively changed

04:25.724 --> 04:27.852
people's opinions
about Hitchcock

04:28.268 --> 04:31.863
<i>and so Hitchcock began to be
taken much more seriously.</i>

04:33.356 --> 04:36.200
<i>At that time,
the general consensus</i>

04:36.276 --> 04:41.077
and climate was
a bullying, as usual,

04:42.073 --> 04:45.577
by the establishment as
to what serious cinema is.

04:47.412 --> 04:50.291
<i>So it was
really revolutionary.</i>

04:50.373 --> 04:52.171
<i>Based on what the
Truffaut-Hitchcock book was,</i>

04:52.250 --> 04:55.880
<i>we became radicalized
as moviemakers.</i>

04:57.047 --> 04:58.344
<i>It was almost as if
somebody had taken</i>

04:58.423 --> 04:59.800
a weight off our
shoulders and said,

04:59.883 --> 05:01.556
"Yes, we can embrace
this, we could go."

05:05.430 --> 05:08.479
<i>In 1962,
Hitchcock was 63 years old,</i>

05:10.185 --> 05:14.565
a <i>household name in television, and</i>
a <i>virtual franchise unto himself.</i>

05:19.027 --> 05:22.998
<i>He had already been known for many
years as the "master of suspense,"</i>

05:23.573 --> 05:27.294
<i>and he had scared the wits out of
audiences all over the world with Psycho,</i>

05:27.994 --> 05:31.464
<i>and in the process, upended
our idea of what a movie was.</i>

05:32.082 --> 05:37.589
And in this house, the most dire,
horrible event took place.

05:39.172 --> 05:40.719
<i>Let's go inside.</i>

05:41.049 --> 05:44.349
<i>He had just completed
his 40th feature, The Birds.</i>

05:51.434 --> 05:55.780
<i>Truffaut, half Hitchcock's age,
had made only three features,</i>

05:56.022 --> 06:00.368
<i>but he was already an internationally
renowned and acclaimed filmmaker.</i>

06:12.455 --> 06:14.207
<i>Truffaut wrote
Hitchcock a letter.</i>

06:14.457 --> 06:17.051
<i>He proposed a series of
in-depth discussions</i>

06:17.127 --> 06:20.381
<i>of Hitchcock's entire body
of work in movies.</i>

06:53.705 --> 06:56.128
<i>For Truffaut,
the book on Hitchcock</i>

06:56.207 --> 06:59.586
<i>was every bit as important
as one of his own films,</i>

06:59.669 --> 07:03.219
<i>and it required just as much
time and preparation.</i>

07:43.880 --> 07:48.101
<i>The meeting was documented by the
great photographer Philippe Halsman.</i>

07:51.638 --> 07:54.517
<i>Hitchcock and Truffaut.</i>

07:54.599 --> 07:57.819
<i>They were from different generations
and different cultures,</i>

07:57.894 --> 08:00.943
<i>and they had different approaches
to their work.</i>

08:01.022 --> 08:05.152
<i>But both men lived for,
and through, the cinema.</i>

08:11.282 --> 08:14.081
<i>My mind
is strictly visual.</i>

08:16.830 --> 08:19.504
<i>Hitchcock was born
with the movies.</i>

08:23.712 --> 08:27.091
<i>There's no such
thing as a <i>face,</i></i>

08:27.173 --> 08:30.052
<i>it's nonexistent until
the light hits it.</i>

08:33.388 --> 08:35.857
<i>There was no such
thing as a line,</i>

08:35.932 --> 08:38.775
<i>it's just light and shade.</i>

08:39.936 --> 08:44.191
<i>The function of pure cinema,
as we well know,</i>

08:44.274 --> 08:47.869
<i>is the placing of two or three
pieces of film together</i>

08:47.944 --> 08:49.821
<i>to create a single idea.</i>

08:57.287 --> 08:59.585
<i>Hitchcock
was trained as an engineer,</i>

09:00.665 --> 09:02.508
<i>then moved into advertising.</i>

09:03.418 --> 09:05.466
<i>Through that,
I went into the designing</i>

09:05.545 --> 09:06.922
<i>of what were,</i>

09:07.005 --> 09:11.226
<i>in those days of silent
films, the art title.</i>

09:12.635 --> 09:15.855
<i>And then art direction, script
writing, and production duties.</i>

09:19.476 --> 09:22.480
<i>They said, "How would
you like to direct</i> a <i>picture?"</i>

09:22.562 --> 09:25.361
<i>And I said, "I've never
thought about it."</i>

09:25.440 --> 09:27.192
<i>I was 23.</i>

09:29.402 --> 09:31.700
<i>My wife was
to be my assistant.</i>

09:32.989 --> 09:35.242
We're not married <i>yet,</i>

09:35.325 --> 09:37.874
<i>but we're not
living in sin either.</i>

09:43.833 --> 09:46.086
<i>Hitchcock
had many close collaborators,</i>

09:46.169 --> 09:49.343
<i>but none of them
was closer than Alma Reville.</i>

09:50.715 --> 09:54.765
<i>She was credited on some films,
uncredited on many others,</i>

09:54.844 --> 09:58.894
<i>but Hitchcock consulted his wife
on every movie he ever made.</i>

10:03.144 --> 10:08.742
<i>The Lodger was the first
time I'd exercised any style.</i>

10:22.497 --> 10:24.374
<i>He is making
floors out of glass</i>

10:24.457 --> 10:28.803
so that he can show people walking
in circles in the apartment above.

10:28.878 --> 10:33.179
He's playing with
all those things

10:33.258 --> 10:36.637
<i>that make cinema fun</i>

10:37.345 --> 10:40.565
<i>and magic, the tricks of it.</i>

10:43.101 --> 10:45.479
He was also conceptual

10:45.562 --> 10:47.405
with the way he approached
many of these films.

10:48.481 --> 10:52.531
<i>This movie, I have an idea for a
way that I've never worked before.</i>

10:58.408 --> 11:01.878
This is somebody whose mind
is racing, filled with ideas

11:01.953 --> 11:04.627
and that's why, you know,
we refer to him all the time.

11:06.040 --> 11:09.465
Do you realize the squad van
will be here any moment?

11:09.586 --> 11:11.429
No, really! Oh, my God,
I'm terribly frightened.

11:11.546 --> 11:14.015
Why? Have you been
a bad woman or something?

11:14.090 --> 11:15.808
Well, not just bad, but...

11:15.884 --> 11:17.181
But you've slept with men?

11:17.260 --> 11:18.432
Oh, no!

11:18.511 --> 11:19.763
WOMAN; Knife.

11:19.846 --> 11:21.098
<i>He directed
the first British talkie.</i>

11:21.181 --> 11:23.354
<i>And if you use a penknife!
Or a pocketknife!</i>

11:23.433 --> 11:25.606
Alice, cut us a bit
of bread, will you?

11:25.685 --> 11:27.938
<i>I mean, in Chelsea
you mustn't use a knife!</i>

11:29.439 --> 11:32.113
<i>And then, in 1934,</i>

11:32.275 --> 11:35.370
<i>he made the first
100 % Hitchcock picture.</i>

11:36.821 --> 11:38.289
<i>St. Moritz
was the beginning</i>

11:38.364 --> 11:40.366
of The Man Who Knew Too Much.

11:43.244 --> 11:45.588
<i>It was the place
of our honeymoon.</i>

12:16.611 --> 12:18.989
<i>And of course,
Hollywood beckoned.</i>

12:22.325 --> 12:26.046
<i>I wasn't attracted
to Hollywood as a place.</i>

12:28.414 --> 12:29.916
<i>That had no interest,</i>

12:29.999 --> 12:33.799
<i>what had interest for me was
getting inside that studio.</i>

12:54.357 --> 12:57.736
<i>Hitchcock did some of his
best work in the '40s.</i>

13:05.535 --> 13:07.708
<i>But in the '50s, he soared.</i>

13:07.787 --> 13:10.711
I have a murder on my conscience,
but it's not my murder.

13:12.542 --> 13:14.419
<i>And curiosity
of James Stewart,</i>

13:14.502 --> 13:19.053
<i>in this story of a romance shadowed
by the terror of a horrifying secret.</i>

13:24.762 --> 13:28.266
Look, John, hold them.

13:28.725 --> 13:29.851
Diamonds.

13:41.362 --> 13:43.160
<i>There was a spell
that was cast with those films</i>

13:43.239 --> 13:44.832
<i>in the '50s and the '60s.</i>

13:46.826 --> 13:51.457
And it's a special
blessed time for me

13:51.539 --> 13:53.587
because I saw them
as they came out.

14:03.509 --> 14:05.136
<i>Truffaut began
as a critic in the early '50s.</i>

14:07.013 --> 14:10.608
<i>He started at the great French
film magazine, Gamers du UnÃ©ma.</i>

14:11.059 --> 14:15.439
<i>For the writers at Cahiers, soon to become
the filmmakers of the Nouvelle Vague,</i>

14:15.897 --> 14:19.777
<i>Hitchcock's greatness
as an artist was self-evident.</i>

14:33.790 --> 14:35.383
<i>Before they made
their own movies,</i>

14:35.458 --> 14:38.337
the Cahiers critics erected
a new pantheon of cinema-

14:39.295 --> 14:41.343
<i>The directors who were
the true artists,</i>

14:41.964 --> 14:45.810
<i>the authors who wrote with
the camera, the auteurs.</i>

15:47.196 --> 15:51.201
<i>Being an individual artist
meant self-exposure,</i>

15:51.868 --> 15:54.291
<i>pouring all of yourself into your movie,</i>

15:54.996 --> 15:58.421
<i>all of your fears
and obsessions and fetishes,</i>

15:59.250 --> 16:01.002
<i>just like Hitchcock did.</i>

16:04.881 --> 16:06.929
All together! Pull!

16:31.532 --> 16:35.253
<i>Hitchcock often told the story of being
sent to the police station as a boy,</i>

16:35.328 --> 16:39.299
<i>where he was locked up for a few
minutes as a symbolic punishment.</i>

16:40.208 --> 16:43.803
<i>He said that it led to a
lifelong fear of the police.</i>

16:50.843 --> 16:53.596
<i>But Truffaut
really was locked up.</i>

16:54.347 --> 16:57.191
<i>He was delivered to the police
by his own father,</i>

16:58.434 --> 17:00.482
<i>and then sent to
a juvenile detention center,</i>

17:08.027 --> 17:11.952
<i>an episode he put into his
autobiographical first feature.</i>

17:28.839 --> 17:31.809
<i>Truffaut had a fierce
attachment to freedom.</i>

17:31.884 --> 17:33.602
<i>It's there
in all of his films.</i>

17:34.011 --> 17:38.983
<i>And it sent him in search of another
father, a father who would liberate him.</i>

17:40.184 --> 17:42.903
<i>He found the great
film critic Andre' Bazin,</i>

17:42.979 --> 17:47.485
<i>who virtually adopted Truffaut and
brought him to Gamers du UnÃ©ma.</i>

17:51.862 --> 17:53.535
<i>He found Jean Renoir,</i>

17:54.115 --> 17:55.913
<i>and Roberto Rossellini.</i>

17:59.745 --> 18:02.373
<i>And he found Alfred Hitchcock.</i>

18:02.456 --> 18:05.380
<i>Hitchcock had freed Truffaut as an artist,</i>

18:05.459 --> 18:08.588
<i>and Truffaut wanted to reciprocate
by freeing Hitchcock</i>

18:08.671 --> 18:11.550
<i>from his reputation as a light entertainer.</i>

18:12.925 --> 18:16.179
<i>And that's the basis on which
they started their conversation.</i>

18:21.726 --> 18:25.151
<i>Well, let me check with
him and see if he's running yet.</i>

18:28.274 --> 18:29.571
<i>You started?</i>

18:29.692 --> 18:30.693
<i>You're up?</i>

18:32.111 --> 18:35.206
<i>All right, you're
running now, huh? Okay, fine.</i>

18:35.823 --> 18:37.370
<i>We are now on the air.</i>

18:47.376 --> 18:48.969
<i>WOMAN". Your type of picture?</i>

18:52.131 --> 18:59.310
<i>People get enjoyment
but pretend not to be fooled.</i>

19:01.223 --> 19:02.770
<i>They sulk,
they begrudge...</i>

19:02.850 --> 19:04.693
<i>They give their
pleasure grudgingly.</i>

19:04.769 --> 19:06.021
<i>HYYCHCOCK'. Yes. Well...</i>

19:06.103 --> 19:08.652
<i>When I say pleasure, I don't
mean amusement. I mean their enjoyment.</i>

19:08.731 --> 19:10.859
<i>They are obviously...</i>

19:10.941 --> 19:13.410
<i>They're going to sit there
and say, "Show me!"</i>

19:17.531 --> 19:20.831
<i>They expect to anticipate-
"I know what's coming next-"</i>

19:20.910 --> 19:23.083
<i>I have to say, "Do you?"</i>

19:38.260 --> 19:39.933
<i>Yes,
but you see, to me,</i>

19:41.263 --> 19:45.143
<i>plausibility for
the sake of plausibility</i>

19:45.226 --> 19:48.025
<i>does not help, you know.</i>

20:10.418 --> 20:15.140
<i>I have a favorite little
saying to myself, "Logic is dull."</i>

20:23.222 --> 20:25.896
<i>Is it possible now
for us to define suspense?</i>

20:25.975 --> 20:29.900
<i>That is to say, are there
many forms of suspense?</i>

20:31.605 --> 20:34.575
<i>People believe,
uh, somewhat naively...</i>

20:36.569 --> 20:40.119
<i>...that suspense is when one is afraid.
Which is wrong.</i>

20:40.197 --> 20:44.247
No, no.
<i>In</i> the <i>film</i> Easy Virtue...

20:45.828 --> 20:48.832
<i>...a young man
was proposing to this woman.</i>

20:50.291 --> 20:53.170
<i>She wouldn't give an answer,</i>

20:53.294 --> 20:57.845
<i>she said, "I'll call you up
when I get back around 12:00."</i>

21:03.888 --> 21:09.395
<i>And all I showed was the operator
on this telephone switchboard.</i>

21:13.689 --> 21:16.112
<i>That girl is in suspense!</i>

21:18.027 --> 21:21.873
<i>And she was
relieved at the end,</i>

21:21.947 --> 21:23.870
<i>so that the suspense
was over.</i>

21:24.950 --> 21:27.578
<i>The woman said, "Yes."</i>

21:27.661 --> 21:30.835
<i>The suspense doesn't
always have fear in it.</i>

21:54.021 --> 21:55.318
<i>He talks about things,</i>

21:55.397 --> 21:59.573
contextualizing what the
work of a director truly is

21:59.735 --> 22:03.410
at its most fundamental
and most simple.

22:07.284 --> 22:10.413
<i>Emotionally,
the size of the image...</i>

22:10.496 --> 22:12.965
<i>is very important.</i>

22:13.415 --> 22:15.634
<i>You're dealing with space.</i>

22:18.128 --> 22:21.257
<i>You may need space
and use it dramatically.</i>

22:25.594 --> 22:29.315
<i>When the girl shrank
back on the sofa,</i>

22:30.975 --> 22:35.025
<i>I kept the camera back
and used the space</i>

22:35.104 --> 22:40.861
<i>to indicate the nothingness
from which she was shrinking.</i>

22:47.658 --> 22:51.538
<i>If you have
some kind of understanding</i>

22:51.620 --> 22:54.840
of color and design
and light...

22:55.374 --> 22:58.002
<i>Directing is
really three things.</i>

22:58.794 --> 23:02.048
You're editing behavior
over time,

23:02.131 --> 23:06.056
and then controlling moments
that should be really fast

23:06.135 --> 23:08.229
and making them slow,

23:08.304 --> 23:11.353
and moments that should be really
slow and making them fast.

23:11.432 --> 23:13.651
<i>It is indeed
a solemn occasion.</i>

23:13.726 --> 23:16.070
<i>I switch you over
to our microphone...</i>

23:20.316 --> 23:23.240
<i>Yes.
That's what film is for.</i>

23:24.194 --> 23:27.994
<i>To either contract time...</i>

23:28.616 --> 23:31.369
<i>...or extend it.
Whatever you wish.</i>

23:41.211 --> 23:43.134
<i>Hitchcock, in
a way, was the master,</i>

23:43.213 --> 23:46.717
let's say sculptor
of moments in time

23:46.800 --> 23:48.894
to take you through
a sequence

23:48.969 --> 23:51.438
or to direct your
perception in a way

23:51.513 --> 23:54.016
where he could elongate
time or telescope it.

23:55.768 --> 23:59.272
<i>Well, there are moments
when you have to stop time.</i>

24:13.369 --> 24:16.748
<i>Describe to me
in detail what the action was.</i>

24:22.044 --> 24:24.672
<i>Cutting to the
mother before the boy saw her?</i>

24:27.049 --> 24:29.051
<i>She was not
looking at the child yet.</i>

24:33.013 --> 24:36.142
<i>And then you show the
mother who saw them walking away.</i>

24:38.352 --> 24:42.357
<i>I'm asking from a story
point of view, what was the intention?</i>

24:50.572 --> 24:53.075
<i>I would have hoped
that there was nothing spoken.</i>

25:39.496 --> 25:41.624
<i>The thing I think about
the most with Hitchcock is</i>

25:42.041 --> 25:46.638
the visuals are so
graphic and precise.

25:47.463 --> 25:49.932
<i>There is a lot
to learn from that.</i>

25:53.635 --> 25:56.388
<i>He said, "When I'm
on the set, I'm not on the set.</i>

25:56.472 --> 25:58.600
<i>"I'm watching it
on the screen."</i>

25:59.641 --> 26:01.234
That's the key to
Hitchcock, in a way.

26:01.310 --> 26:03.187
I mean, he sees the
picture in his head.

26:09.610 --> 26:12.238
I imagine he just sat alone
and these images came to him

26:12.321 --> 26:13.664
and hejust
never questioned it.

26:28.003 --> 26:31.883
You don't feel like he's ever
not confident in every shot.

26:34.968 --> 26:37.016
<i>That's one guy you
don't really question.</i>

26:37.304 --> 26:39.853
It always works within his
world, kind of perfectly.

27:52.296 --> 27:54.264
Lthoughtyou
didn't like to cook.

27:54.882 --> 27:56.555
No, I don't like to cook.

28:19.615 --> 28:21.367
I'd be delighted.

28:22.492 --> 28:24.711
<i>Even if they go
all the way across the room,</i>

28:24.786 --> 28:26.709
<i>he is going to move
with them in the kiss</i>

28:26.788 --> 28:27.880
<i>and the actors
are going to say,</i>

28:27.956 --> 28:29.674
<i>"This is the most
bizarre thing,</i>

28:29.750 --> 28:31.377
<i>"we are walking
while we are kissing."</i>

28:32.628 --> 28:34.505
<i>But he knows how it
fits in the frame</i>

28:34.630 --> 28:37.053
and he knows that the
tension won't be broken

28:37.132 --> 28:40.181
and, um, the spell
won't be broken.

28:41.595 --> 28:43.347
This is a very strange love affair.

28:43.430 --> 28:45.103
Why?

28:47.392 --> 28:49.815
Maybe the fact that
you don't love me.

28:50.312 --> 28:51.313
Hello?

28:51.396 --> 28:55.572
<i>I was giving the
public the great privilege</i>

28:55.651 --> 28:59.827
<i>of embracing Cary Grant
and Ingrid Bergman together.</i>

29:01.615 --> 29:06.837
<i>It was a kind of
temporary mÃ©nage Ã© trois.</i>

29:08.455 --> 29:11.208
<i>And the actors
hated doing it.</i>

29:11.333 --> 29:14.633
<i>They felt dreadfully uncomfortable-</i>

29:14.711 --> 29:18.306
<i>...in the manner in which they
had to cling to each other.</i>

29:19.174 --> 29:21.597
<i>And I said, "Well,
I don't care how you feel,</i>

29:21.677 --> 29:24.146
<i>"I only know what it's gonna
look like on the screen."</i>

29:29.309 --> 29:34.361
He obviously had contentious
relationships, in some cases, with actors.

29:34.439 --> 29:37.192
You know, he definitely
solicited movie stars.

29:37.442 --> 29:40.241
You know, there is no doubt
in reading the book

29:40.320 --> 29:43.290
that he is very
cognizant of the value

29:43.365 --> 29:45.788
of faces that
people want to see.

29:47.035 --> 29:51.165
<i>And sometimes, the complications
that come with that baggage.</i>

29:51.665 --> 29:55.670
<i>Montgomery Clift is
transcendent in</i> I <i>Confess. He's great.</i>

29:56.044 --> 29:58.172
But I don't think
Hitchcock cared

29:58.255 --> 30:00.974
if they had a good time or not
or how they felt about him.

30:01.049 --> 30:05.225
Obviously, that wasn't
a huge concern of his.

30:06.013 --> 30:10.018
<i>Sometimes you need
a look to convey something.</i>

30:11.560 --> 30:13.562
...or <i>to look at
something and react.</i>

30:15.689 --> 30:18.238
<i>I had a conflict with Clift.</i>

30:20.694 --> 30:24.449
<i>I said, "Monty, I want you
to look up at the hotel."</i>

30:26.241 --> 30:30.792
<i>Uh, so he said to me, "I don't know
whether I would look up to the hotel."</i>

30:32.414 --> 30:33.506
<i>I said, "Why not?"</i>

30:33.582 --> 30:37.428
<i>He said, "I may be occupied
by the people below."</i>

30:39.379 --> 30:44.351
<i>I said, "I want you to look
up to the hotel windows</i>

30:44.426 --> 30:45.848
<i>"and please do so."</i>

30:46.178 --> 30:49.899
<i>I was telling the audience
across the street is the hotel.</i>

30:50.849 --> 30:53.602
<i>So an actor is gonna try
and interfere with me,</i>

30:53.685 --> 30:56.438
<i>organizing my geography.</i>

30:56.646 --> 30:59.069
<i>That's why all
actors are cattle.</i>

31:01.860 --> 31:05.615
<i>With Hitchcock you get a sense
of a kind of a self-contained psychology</i>

31:05.697 --> 31:07.870
that we were gonna
explore his obsessions

31:07.949 --> 31:09.701
and what he was
interested in.

31:09.785 --> 31:11.628
I think his
collaboration there

31:11.703 --> 31:13.501
didn't go much
farther than that.

31:14.498 --> 31:18.799
<i>Acting, it's</i> a
<i>great part of movie making</i>

31:19.669 --> 31:21.592
but it's not the only
part of movie making.

31:21.671 --> 31:25.471
And I think Hitchcock was one
of the first people to say

31:25.550 --> 31:28.474
<i>there is a structure
to this language.</i>

31:39.564 --> 31:44.240
<i>He probably did more for the
psychological underpinnings</i>

31:44.319 --> 31:45.411
<i>of characterization</i>

31:45.487 --> 31:47.956
<i>in motion pictures
than anyone.</i>

31:54.121 --> 31:58.251
And on top of it, wouldn't
allow any of his actors

31:58.333 --> 32:01.883
to explore that kind
of behavior on set.

32:01.962 --> 32:06.217
It was the rigor of dramatizing
it in narrative terms,

32:06.299 --> 32:09.724
and then not allowing for it to, like,
spill over the edge of the bucket.

32:14.474 --> 32:15.475
<i>SCORSESE". Coming out
of World War H,</i>

32:15.559 --> 32:18.688
<i>which is the worst
recorded war in history.</i>

32:19.646 --> 32:22.616
<i>Destruction of civilization,</i>

32:22.691 --> 32:26.036
<i>no peace or comfort
from religion.</i>

32:27.362 --> 32:29.364
<i>The paranoia, the anxiety.</i>

32:31.450 --> 32:33.418
<i>Who are we? What are we?</i>

32:35.745 --> 32:39.295
Post-World VVar ll, there
was a rupture, a change.

32:39.374 --> 32:43.550
Um, particularly in the
nature of what a performance

32:43.628 --> 32:46.552
or a persona
onscreen would be.

32:47.549 --> 32:50.473
<i>And that is that the actor
is the main instrument really.</i>

32:51.553 --> 32:56.024
<i>And this is all expressed I think
in Brando, James Dean, and Clift.</i>

32:56.725 --> 32:59.774
Alfred Hitchcock was able to get
the soul of the actors on screen,

32:59.853 --> 33:03.232
whether it's Cary Grant, Eva Marie
Saint, Grace Kelly, Jimmy Stewart.

33:04.608 --> 33:06.531
<i>But it comes of
another tradition.</i>

33:08.653 --> 33:14.080
<i>I'd love to see
De Niro, Pacino, Dustin Hoffman.</i>

33:14.743 --> 33:18.498
To see that school of actor,

33:18.580 --> 33:24.587
you know, try to flourish
under the iron umbrella of

33:25.128 --> 33:29.133
this is what this next three
and a half seconds is about.

33:33.803 --> 33:36.352
<i>I would like to ask you.</i>

33:36.431 --> 33:38.354
<i>Do you feel
it's too much trouble</i>

33:38.433 --> 33:42.609
<i>having to direct actors
in their acting?</i>

33:44.981 --> 33:47.575
<i>What I'd like is
an intermediary formula.</i>

33:49.110 --> 33:54.162
<i>That is to say, to speak with an
actor the evening after dinner,</i>

33:55.450 --> 33:58.795
<i>and then create
the dialogue in the night</i>

33:58.870 --> 34:00.747
<i>with the words which he
himself has been using</i>

34:00.830 --> 34:02.924
<i>from his own vocabulary.</i>

34:02.999 --> 34:06.173
<i>Yes. Will that mean
you have to write overnight?</i>

34:25.021 --> 34:30.243
<i>Alive perhaps, but which are
very dangerous for the curve...</i>

34:30.318 --> 34:32.571
<i>For the shape,
the shape of the picture.</i>

34:35.949 --> 34:41.581
<i>I often am troubled
as to whether! Cling to the,</i>

34:41.663 --> 34:44.882
<i>what I call the rising
curve-shape of a story</i>

34:46.042 --> 34:48.841
<i>...and whether I shouldn't
experiment more</i>

34:48.920 --> 34:52.925
<i>with a looser
form of narrative.</i>

34:54.509 --> 34:56.511
Sometimes <i>it's</i> very hard- - -

34:56.636 --> 35:01.437
<i>...because if you work
for character direct,</i>

35:01.516 --> 35:04.144
<i>they'll take you along
where they want to go.</i>

35:04.227 --> 35:07.276
<i>And I'm like the old lady
with the boy scouts.</i>

35:07.355 --> 35:08.652
<i>I don't want to
do go that way.</i>

35:11.526 --> 35:14.700
<i>And this has always
been a conflict with me.</i>

35:21.536 --> 35:23.209
<i>It seems to me
he finds material</i>

35:23.288 --> 35:24.881
<i>that he can kind of,
you know,</i>

35:24.956 --> 35:26.503
<i>it's an applied science.</i>

35:26.583 --> 35:32.056
<i>He can sort of apply the
Hitchcock thing to this story.</i>

35:32.714 --> 35:36.514
By now I have my series
of linear plot devices

35:36.593 --> 35:38.311
leading to a fall
from a high place.

35:45.685 --> 35:47.528
<i>Quite obviously, I'm, uh...</i>

35:48.897 --> 35:52.822
<i>I suppose like any artist
who paints or writes,</i>

35:52.901 --> 35:56.280
<i>I'm limited to a certain
field, you know.</i>

36:33.358 --> 36:37.864
<i>I went high because I
didn't want to spend a lot of footage</i>

36:37.946 --> 36:40.699
<i>on people getting out hoses...</i>

36:40.782 --> 36:42.409
<i>...and starting
to put out a fire.</i>

36:46.871 --> 36:48.919
<i>If you play it
a long way away,</i>

36:48.998 --> 36:50.966
<i>you aren't committed
to any detail.</i>

36:52.043 --> 36:55.047
Ltwasn'tjust, um,
simply to show the whole town

36:55.130 --> 36:56.632
and how the birds
are coming in.

36:56.715 --> 37:01.391
It took on another kind of
apocalyptic, religious feel.

37:01.678 --> 37:03.305
<i>It was omniscient.</i>

37:04.472 --> 37:07.021
It's the cleansing
of the Earth.

37:07.434 --> 37:10.904
Whose point of view is it when
you cut to above everything?

37:10.979 --> 37:13.698
God's point of view? Are we
all being judged from above?

37:13.773 --> 37:15.446
You know, that kind
of suggests that.

37:21.948 --> 37:23.950
Where are those
papers now, exactly?

37:24.409 --> 37:25.911
<i>For me that angle
is always something</i>

37:25.994 --> 37:28.668
that has a kind of
religious element to it.

37:36.463 --> 37:38.340
<i>Go off the record.</i>

37:41.009 --> 37:43.478
<i>You know, you have Martin
Balsam going up the stairs, right?</i>

37:43.553 --> 37:45.351
And that's so
deliberately slow,

37:45.430 --> 37:47.398
you just know
he's gonna get it,

37:47.474 --> 37:49.897
but you don't expect
that high angle.

37:52.520 --> 37:56.366
There's something omniscient about
it that's kind of frightening.

38:06.326 --> 38:07.669
Yes.

38:29.891 --> 38:33.065
<i>Everyone always has
something to feel guilty about.</i>

38:33.728 --> 38:35.571
<i>They're asking,
"Did you ever hear of topaz?"</i>

38:35.647 --> 38:38.150
Colonel Kusenov, does the word
"topaz" mean anything to you?

38:39.359 --> 38:41.327
<i>It cuts to the defector</i>

38:41.402 --> 38:44.121
and the camera's sort of
up above him a little bit.

38:44.197 --> 38:46.245
And you see his eye shift.

38:46.574 --> 38:49.418
The eye is not covered. That means
the angle had to just be right.

38:51.371 --> 38:54.295
Now, you know he's lying,
it's that poem.

38:54.874 --> 38:58.469
<i>You may leave the religion, but the
Hound of Heaven is always there.</i>

39:01.422 --> 39:04.392
That infuses everything,
the whole thought process

39:04.467 --> 39:05.935
and the storytelling process.

39:07.470 --> 39:12.818
And continually turn
our hearts from wickedness,

39:12.892 --> 39:17.898
and from worldly things
unto thee...

39:44.799 --> 39:46.642
Over the years,
I keep revisiting it

39:46.718 --> 39:48.641
by watching it, watching
it over and over again.

39:51.347 --> 39:54.226
<i>This is the average man,
decent man I should say.</i>

39:55.143 --> 39:57.566
Family, kids...
Uh, suddenly picked up.

39:57.896 --> 39:59.148
Your name Chris?

39:59.606 --> 40:00.732
You're calling me?

40:00.815 --> 40:02.943
<i>And everything...</i>

40:03.318 --> 40:04.319
Yes, it is.

40:04.694 --> 40:07.322
Everything
points to him doing it.

40:08.239 --> 40:09.286
And you know he didn't.

40:09.657 --> 40:15.960
One, two, three, four...

40:18.082 --> 40:19.129
You're sure?

40:19.208 --> 40:20.255
Absolutely.

40:36.059 --> 40:37.481
<i>Those extraordinary inserts</i>

40:37.560 --> 40:40.484
<i>where Henry Fonda's
just sitting on the bunk,</i>

40:41.022 --> 40:42.740
<i>he looks at the cell
around him.</i>

40:42.815 --> 40:45.614
<i>And it cuts to different
sections of the cell.</i>

40:47.528 --> 40:49.701
<i>What makes you
feel oppressed?</i>

40:49.781 --> 40:52.079
<i>The lock on the door,
but from what angle?</i>

40:53.076 --> 40:55.374
<i>Is it really
his point of view?</i>

40:56.037 --> 40:57.380
All these things are
remarkable, I think.

41:06.547 --> 41:07.514
<i>Yes, that's right.</i>

41:58.808 --> 42:00.276
Not a lot, no.

42:03.771 --> 42:06.274
<i>One senses in your work
the importance of dreams.</i>

42:06.357 --> 42:08.359
<i>Daydreams, probably.</i>

42:16.159 --> 42:19.629
<i>Well, that's
probably me within myself.</i>

42:30.381 --> 42:31.473
Look.

42:35.303 --> 42:36.976
<i>I think it occurs</i>

42:37.055 --> 42:41.276
<i>because I am never satisfied
with the ordinary.</i>

42:42.435 --> 42:45.689
<i>I can't do well
with the ordinary.</i>

43:03.498 --> 43:07.799
<i>Hitchcock keeps referring
to these, sort of, fetish objects.</i>

43:08.920 --> 43:12.766
Keys and handcuffs
and ropes and stuff,

43:12.840 --> 43:14.888
which are kind of
dream objects

43:15.843 --> 43:19.598
<i>which have a kind of
Freudian weight to them.</i>

44:45.474 --> 44:49.980
<i>Silent pictures are
the pure motion picture form.</i>

44:52.565 --> 44:58.698
<i>There was no need to
abandon the technique</i>

44:58.779 --> 45:01.658
<i>of the pure motion picture</i>

45:01.949 --> 45:04.953
<i>the way it was abandoned
when the sound came in.</i>

45:13.169 --> 45:16.639
The craft was of course developed
in silent cinema first.

45:17.256 --> 45:19.224
So the whole idea was,

45:19.300 --> 45:22.179
"How do I tell the story
without any dialogue?"

45:22.803 --> 45:25.977
This is a brilliant way to train
someone to think visually,

45:26.599 --> 45:28.317
<i>and part of the reason
the films have</i>

45:28.392 --> 45:30.394
<i>that incredible
dream-like feeling.</i>

45:53.334 --> 45:56.304
<i>UNKLATER". So many Hitchcock
films would work silently.</i>

45:58.130 --> 46:01.680
You could watch a Hitchcock film
without any dialogue or music

46:01.759 --> 46:05.138
and I think you'd still get a
really high percentage of it.

46:38.045 --> 46:39.592
<i>They're meant
to achieve a realism,</i>

46:39.672 --> 46:41.094
<i>but it's more of a...
How should I put this?</i>

46:41.173 --> 46:45.053
Spirit of realism.
It isn't objective.

47:20.296 --> 47:22.845
<i>Yes, but you are
dealing with the point of view</i>

47:22.923 --> 47:24.596
<i>of an emotional man.</i>

47:31.807 --> 47:36.563
<i>I was intrigued with
the effort to create a woman...</i>

47:37.730 --> 47:40.734
<i>...after another in
the image of a dead woman.</i>

47:50.618 --> 47:54.543
<i>If you think that you can
hide what your interests are,</i>

47:54.622 --> 47:57.296
what your prurient
interests are,

47:57.375 --> 47:59.844
what your noble
interests are,

47:59.919 --> 48:02.342
what your
fascinations are...

48:02.421 --> 48:05.049
If you think you can
hide that in your work

48:05.132 --> 48:07.885
as a film director,
you're nuts, you know.

48:07.968 --> 48:10.892
And I think that he was one
of the first guys who said,

48:12.473 --> 48:15.898
"I'm gonna go with it."
"I'm just going to...

48:15.976 --> 48:17.853
"I'm gonna be...
I gotta be me."

48:22.650 --> 48:25.244
<i>And in the case
of his best work,</i>

48:25.319 --> 48:30.496
there is a more direct
umbilicus to his subconscious.

48:32.618 --> 48:35.838
<i>Certainly I think
that is true of Vertigo.</i>

48:36.288 --> 48:39.041
<i>The sex
psychological side is that...</i>

48:40.167 --> 48:44.422
<i>...you have a man
creating a sex image,</i>

48:44.505 --> 48:47.429
<i>but he can't
go to bed with her</i>

48:47.508 --> 48:52.560
<i>until he's got her back to the
thing he wants to go to bed with.</i>

48:52.721 --> 48:55.099
It should be back from your
face and pinned at the neck.

48:55.182 --> 48:57.276
I told her that.
I told you that.

48:58.352 --> 48:59.478
We tried it.

48:59.562 --> 49:02.691
<i>Or metaphorically indulged</i>

49:02.773 --> 49:05.868
<i>in a form of necrophilia.</i>

49:06.318 --> 49:07.695
<i>That's what it really was.</i>

49:07.778 --> 49:09.030
Please, Judy.

49:11.490 --> 49:16.462
<i>The thing you see
that I liked and felt most</i>

49:16.537 --> 49:20.792
<i>when she came back from
having her hair made blond</i>

49:20.875 --> 49:22.468
<i>and it wasn't up.</i>

49:24.545 --> 49:30.723
<i>This means she has stripped, but
won't take her knickers off.</i>

49:33.387 --> 49:34.639
You see.

49:34.722 --> 49:38.898
<i>She says all right, and she goes
into the bath and he is waiting.</i>

49:41.020 --> 49:44.115
<i>He's waiting for the
woman to undress,</i>

49:45.024 --> 49:49.370
and come out nude, ready for him-

49:58.412 --> 50:03.714
<i>And while he was looking at
that door, he was getting an erection.</i>

50:04.168 --> 50:06.591
<i>We will now tell a story.
Shut the machine off.</i>

50:07.713 --> 50:11.138
What I love about Vertigo
is just, it's so perverted.

50:11.217 --> 50:13.094
It's just so perverted.

50:14.094 --> 50:17.314
Here, Judy, drink this straight down.
Just like medicine.

50:18.599 --> 50:22.103
Why are you doing this?
What good will it do?

50:22.436 --> 50:26.236
I've always felt that the most
interesting view of Vertigo

50:26.941 --> 50:29.865
would be her story.

50:31.445 --> 50:33.447
The color of your hair.

50:36.200 --> 50:38.453
Judy, please,
it can't matter to you!

50:39.954 --> 50:42.173
<i>And it's almost more honest
than the guy's point of view.</i>

50:42.373 --> 50:43.465
If...

50:46.043 --> 50:48.671
If I let you change me,
will that do it?

50:49.463 --> 50:53.093
<i>I guess taking
Scottie's point of view</i> was...

50:53.259 --> 50:54.511
Will you love me?

50:54.635 --> 50:56.228
<i>...Hitchcock's
point of view.</i>

50:57.805 --> 50:59.557
Yes.
Fine.

51:04.270 --> 51:05.897
<i>Yes,
I enjoyed it, yes.</i>

51:06.647 --> 51:10.368
<i>You know, I had Vera Miles
tested and costumed.</i>

51:10.442 --> 51:12.115
<i>We were ready to go with her.</i>

51:12.194 --> 51:14.242
<i>She went pregnant,</i>

51:14.321 --> 51:16.415
<i>and that was
going to be the part</i>

51:16.490 --> 51:18.083
<i>that I was going
to bring her out.</i>

51:18.158 --> 51:19.956
<i>She was under contract to me.</i>

51:20.744 --> 51:21.836
<i>But I lost interest.</i>

51:21.912 --> 51:26.258
<i>I couldn't get the rhythm going
again with her. Silly girl.</i>

51:26.333 --> 51:27.755
<i>I don't think
he would have been able</i>

51:27.835 --> 51:30.509
to take Vera Miles
into that Judy place.

51:31.839 --> 51:35.469
<i>Into that real,
kind of, a slutty place.</i>

51:35.884 --> 51:39.354
<i>And so I think that he surmounted
his restriction in that way.</i>

51:41.015 --> 51:45.361
I saw the film
fairly early in my life

51:45.436 --> 51:48.189
as a film person and I
saw it through Marty.

51:48.522 --> 51:51.492
<i>It became
a lost film, so to speak.</i>

51:51.567 --> 51:53.114
I can tell you that all the
filmmakers in the '70s

51:53.193 --> 51:54.661
were trying to find
copies of it.

51:55.696 --> 51:56.948
<i>Some people had 16s.</i>

51:57.031 --> 51:58.908
<i>So it became a picture
we were looking for.</i>

51:59.241 --> 52:02.495
<i>It was a kind of
forbidden document,</i>

52:02.578 --> 52:07.004
<i>a kind of sacred document that only
certain insiders had privilege to.</i>

52:07.082 --> 52:08.675
<i>Which is kind of
hard to imagine</i>

52:08.751 --> 52:13.097
<i>in today's world of indiscriminate
access to virtually everything.</i>

52:14.214 --> 52:17.593
<i>So, the number of people who had
seen Vertigo weren't that many.</i>

52:17.676 --> 52:20.054
<i>Hitchcock wasn't
talking about it that much</i>

52:20.137 --> 52:22.890
<i>because it wasn't
very successful.</i>

52:35.194 --> 52:36.912
<i>The hole in the story.</i>

52:37.488 --> 52:40.662
<i>The husband who pushed
his wife off the tower.</i>

52:40.741 --> 52:44.871
<i>How did he know that Stewart wasn't
going to run up those stairs?</i>

52:46.580 --> 52:47.752
<i>In</i> the <i>case</i> of Vertigo,

52:47.998 --> 52:50.467
the machinations
of the plot...

52:51.335 --> 52:52.837
Well, they do work,
they function,

52:52.920 --> 52:54.297
and they function
rather brilliantly,

52:54.380 --> 52:57.304
but the subtext
seems to be bubbling up

52:57.383 --> 52:59.260
almost to the point
where it's text.

53:03.555 --> 53:06.729
<i>I can't really say
that I believe the plot.</i>

53:07.142 --> 53:10.817
And I don't take any
of the story seriously.

53:10.896 --> 53:13.240
I mean, as a
"realistic story."

53:15.609 --> 53:18.579
<i>So the plot is just a line
that you could hang things on.</i>

53:22.491 --> 53:24.493
And the things that
he hangs on there

53:24.576 --> 53:28.672
are all aspects of,
you know, cinema poetry.

53:33.877 --> 53:35.220
And that's a film
that I can't really tell

53:35.295 --> 53:38.469
where things start and end.
I don't care.

53:38.549 --> 53:41.302
<i>And when he's following her
in the streets in the car,</i>

53:41.385 --> 53:42.932
<i>what is he looking for?</i>

53:44.138 --> 53:46.061
What is he looking for?

53:48.600 --> 53:50.352
<i>The frustration
is on his face.</i>

53:50.644 --> 53:52.897
<i>And you're like, "Where is
this going?" And you realize,</i>

53:52.980 --> 53:57.110
"No, that's totally connected
to who he is in the film."

53:58.986 --> 54:00.659
<i>The city itself
is a character...</i>

54:02.948 --> 54:04.245
<i>The architecture itself.</i>

54:06.160 --> 54:09.630
<i>The mystery of
old San Francisco.</i>

54:12.082 --> 54:13.425
<i>That painting...</i>

54:16.837 --> 54:20.637
We cannot see Kim Novak's face
looking at that painting.

54:20.966 --> 54:23.139
How important
her gaze must be.

54:24.011 --> 54:27.106
But no, it's not,
because it's all a ruse.

54:28.515 --> 54:30.438
The connection that Kim Novak
has with that painting

54:30.517 --> 54:32.519
is bullshit. Right?

54:32.770 --> 54:34.943
The only gaze that matters

54:35.022 --> 54:38.117
<i>is Jimmy Stewart's
gaze watching</i>

54:38.192 --> 54:42.538
<i>the curl in the hair and how it's
similar to the painting on the wall.</i>

54:53.791 --> 54:55.793
<i>I'm sure he didn't shoot
coverage from the front.</i>

54:55.876 --> 54:57.970
<i>Someone like me, I would do that.
We're not that good.</i>

54:58.045 --> 55:03.802
We don't understand the power of
the image, the way that he did.

55:03.926 --> 55:05.724
I don't want anything.
I wanna get out of here.

55:05.803 --> 55:06.975
Judy, do this for me!

55:07.054 --> 55:09.557
<i>This whole business of
remaking her. Yes, we get it.</i>

55:09.640 --> 55:11.859
<i>Everyone's talking
about the fetishism of it.</i>

55:11.934 --> 55:13.106
I don't like it.

55:13.185 --> 55:14.277
Yeah, we'll take it.

55:14.353 --> 55:15.570
Fine, it's good.

55:15.646 --> 55:17.444
But it's this extraordinary
sense of loss

55:17.523 --> 55:19.901
that he's trying
to fill that void.

55:20.400 --> 55:24.155
Um, maybe it reaches out to
everyone, because of that.

55:25.405 --> 55:27.407
You know.
We could bring our own

55:27.491 --> 55:29.084
sense of melancholy
or loss to it.

55:29.868 --> 55:32.121
Judy.Judy,
I'll tell you this.

55:32.204 --> 55:35.458
These past few days have been the first
happy days I've known in a year.

55:35.541 --> 55:36.667
I know.

55:36.959 --> 55:40.259
It's about desire,
but we all understand that.

55:40.629 --> 55:42.302
We all understand
the idea of desire.

55:42.422 --> 55:44.095
That's part of
what makes us us.

55:59.273 --> 56:01.617
<i>I think Kim Novak
coming out of the bathroom</i>

56:01.692 --> 56:03.740
<i>is the single greatest moment
in the history of movies.</i>

56:03.819 --> 56:06.413
<i>At that moment, everything
that Hitchcock was about,</i>

56:06.488 --> 56:10.209
everything that
cinema is about,

56:10.284 --> 56:13.709
comes together in the most
beautiful way, which is...

56:15.664 --> 56:19.510
Yes, it's a fantasy, but the
fantasy is real to him.

56:32.222 --> 56:34.316
That kiss is
so extraordinary.

56:34.391 --> 56:39.238
That's the one moment where he
gets some kind of fulfillment.

56:41.023 --> 56:42.900
And then after that,
it's time to go.

56:43.150 --> 56:45.448
There was where you
made your mistake, Judy.

56:45.819 --> 56:47.787
You shouldn't keep
souvenirs of a killing.

56:49.656 --> 56:51.499
You shouldn't have been...

56:53.076 --> 56:54.874
You shouldn't have
been that sentimental.

56:56.038 --> 56:59.258
<i>It's a world that
he creates that reflects,</i>

56:59.333 --> 57:00.880
<i>I think, what
it is to be alive.</i>

57:01.376 --> 57:03.674
<i>And what it is
to live in fear.</i>

57:05.547 --> 57:07.766
A good fear.
A natural fear.

57:07.841 --> 57:09.935
But fear just the same.

57:11.303 --> 57:13.556
Of just the human condition
of who we are.

57:17.809 --> 57:19.106
<i>It's more than a story.</i>

57:20.270 --> 57:22.238
<i>It's more than a story.</i>

57:23.065 --> 57:25.614
<i>It really is like living
a lifetime with him.</i>

57:35.619 --> 57:37.041
<i>It was a break-even.</i>

57:41.416 --> 57:43.293
<i>I suppose so, yes.</i>

57:44.795 --> 57:46.923
It's tricky. You know,
people will learn

57:47.005 --> 57:49.007
the wrong lessons
from failures

57:49.091 --> 57:52.516
just <i>as</i> they sometimes learn the
wrong lessons from success.

57:55.764 --> 57:59.814
<i>And the thing that I find so
depressing about Hollywood is</i>

57:59.893 --> 58:04.649
<i>how often people really feel
the first three months of</i>

58:04.731 --> 58:08.486
<i>anyone's response
to your film... That's it.</i>

58:09.695 --> 58:12.574
Carve that into marble.
That was the response.

58:12.656 --> 58:15.660
It's not true.
It wasn't true for Vertigo.

58:24.084 --> 58:27.930
<i>There is sometimes
a tendency among filmmakers...</i>

58:29.297 --> 58:31.891
<i>...to forget the audience.</i>

58:33.593 --> 58:37.188
<i>I, personally, am
interested in the audience.</i>

58:39.057 --> 58:44.029
<i>I mean that one's film should
be designed for 2,000 seats,</i>

58:44.104 --> 58:45.447
<i>and not one seat.</i>

58:46.523 --> 58:50.528
<i>This, to me, is the
power of the cinema.</i>

58:51.278 --> 58:57.411
<i>It is the greatest known mass
medium there is in the world.</i>

59:55.092 --> 59:57.265
<i>Directors
of Hitchcock's generation,</i>

59:57.344 --> 59:59.767
<i>the ones who came up
under the studio system,</i>

59:59.846 --> 01:00:02.349
<i>were all mindful
of their audience.</i>

01:00:03.517 --> 01:00:07.567
<i>But in Hitchcock's case,
it ran deeper than that.</i>

01:00:07.646 --> 01:00:12.698
<i>His films are made in a dialogue
with the public that's close, almost intimate.</i>

01:00:15.070 --> 01:00:17.619
<i>It doesn't matter
where the film goes.</i>

01:00:19.616 --> 01:00:22.620
<i>If you've designed
it correctly,</i>

01:00:24.079 --> 01:00:26.798
<i>the Japanese
audience should scream</i>

01:00:26.873 --> 01:00:28.796
<i>at the same time
as the Indian audience.</i>

01:00:33.046 --> 01:00:34.263
<i>Could you still
play an audience</i>

01:00:34.339 --> 01:00:35.465
<i>the way Hitchcock can?
They do.</i>

01:00:35.549 --> 01:00:38.393
<i>But it's a different audience,
and it's different playing.</i>

01:00:38.760 --> 01:00:43.140
See, the audience has been raised
on films which are very loud,

01:00:44.182 --> 01:00:46.230
uh, which have a climax
every two seconds.

01:00:47.394 --> 01:00:52.025
Now, we are so
pummeled by stories

01:00:52.107 --> 01:00:54.781
and visual hyperbole

01:00:54.860 --> 01:00:57.989
<i>that it's a very different
world in trying to</i>

01:00:58.071 --> 01:01:01.166
<i>move the needle in terms of</i>

01:01:01.241 --> 01:01:04.336
<i>getting humans to
accept your theses.</i>

01:01:07.164 --> 01:01:08.586
<i>Hitchcock's coming
out of a world</i>

01:01:08.665 --> 01:01:10.133
<i>where everything
was a proscenium,</i>

01:01:10.208 --> 01:01:11.835
and everything
was structured,

01:01:11.918 --> 01:01:13.920
and he was able to take
that structure and bend it

01:01:14.004 --> 01:01:16.678
<i>and twist it
and exaggerate it</i>

01:01:16.756 --> 01:01:18.508
to a greater
or lesser effect.

01:01:20.844 --> 01:01:24.724
<i>By the time
you get to Psycho,</i>

01:01:24.806 --> 01:01:27.025
<i>people are
watching television.</i>

01:01:27.309 --> 01:01:31.280
<i>And Ed Gein is informing what's
happening in the movies.</i>

01:01:34.399 --> 01:01:37.448
<i>We're starting to borrow
from the real world.</i>

01:01:42.365 --> 01:01:46.711
<i>I believe so,
yes, in Wisconsin somewhere.</i>

01:01:50.081 --> 01:01:53.961
<i>Psycho, in order
to get the audience effects...</i>

01:01:54.878 --> 01:01:56.346
...on the audience,

01:01:57.589 --> 01:02:00.308
<i>I would say that
this is pretty well</i>

01:02:00.383 --> 01:02:02.886
<i>as cinematic as
a lot of pictures.</i>

01:02:09.851 --> 01:02:12.445
<i>It was a <i>very
interesting construction.</i></i>

01:02:12.979 --> 01:02:18.156
<i>I tried for a long time
to play the audience.</i>

01:02:19.152 --> 01:02:21.871
<i>Let's say we were
playing them like an organ.</i>

01:02:22.239 --> 01:02:23.741
Why don't you call
your boss and tell him

01:02:23.823 --> 01:02:26.417
you're taking the rest
of the afternoon off?

01:02:26.493 --> 01:02:28.086
<i>The scene with
John Gavin and Janet Leigh</i>

01:02:28.161 --> 01:02:29.162
<i>in the beginning...</i>

01:02:29.996 --> 01:02:31.418
<i>The element there is the bra.</i>

01:02:32.499 --> 01:02:33.500
Okay-

01:02:35.085 --> 01:02:38.589
But it's shot very simply,
but ominously.

01:02:39.047 --> 01:02:41.470
<i>There's something
ominous about it.</i>

01:02:42.717 --> 01:02:46.813
The scenes in the office are
kind of all right, you know.

01:02:47.347 --> 01:02:48.439
<i>With that Texan...</i>

01:02:48.515 --> 01:02:51.894
I'm buying this house for
my baby's wedding present.

01:02:52.852 --> 01:02:55.605
$40,000 cash.

01:02:55.689 --> 01:02:58.283
<i>For his style,
the blandness of the scenes</i>

01:02:58.358 --> 01:03:00.577
and the blandness
of the framing,

01:03:00.986 --> 01:03:01.987
um,

01:03:02.737 --> 01:03:04.535
is just really
a kind of a bridge

01:03:04.614 --> 01:03:06.742
to get you to the
next major moment.

01:03:07.617 --> 01:03:10.871
<i>I think his instinct is right
in telling stories like that.</i>

01:03:10.954 --> 01:03:13.878
I never carry more than
I can afford to lose.

01:03:13.957 --> 01:03:17.507
How benign can we make these
images that just connect the dots?

01:03:18.420 --> 01:03:20.593
I don't even want it in the
office over the weekend.

01:03:20.714 --> 01:03:22.933
Put it in the safe deposit
box in the bank and...

01:03:23.008 --> 01:03:25.181
<i>It cost
only $800,000 dollars...</i>

01:03:26.344 --> 01:03:29.473
<i>...and I used a complete
television unit to do it.</i>

01:03:31.766 --> 01:03:33.484
He was flirting with you.

01:03:33.560 --> 01:03:35.483
I guess he must have
noticed my wedding ring.

01:03:35.562 --> 01:03:40.318
<i>It was necessary
to make the robbery,</i>

01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:44.997
<i>and what happened to the girl,
purposely on the long side,</i>

01:03:45.071 --> 01:03:48.575
<i>to get an audience
absorbed with her plight.</i>

01:03:49.743 --> 01:03:51.165
Come in.

01:03:51.244 --> 01:03:53.246
<i>Where I slowed up</i>

01:03:53.330 --> 01:03:58.086
<i>was when I came to the scenes
that indicated time and trouble.</i>

01:04:03.548 --> 01:04:06.802
Hitchcock really does
love to surprise people

01:04:06.885 --> 01:04:08.853
and to take you in
unusual directions.

01:04:09.429 --> 01:04:12.933
<i>He sort of thrived on that
and he was very proud of that.</i>

01:04:13.016 --> 01:04:15.018
<i>That's what his cinema
is kind of based on.</i>

01:04:15.101 --> 01:04:20.449
<i>The beginning of Psycho... It's
one of the great misdirections.</i>

01:04:26.279 --> 01:04:30.910
<i>He is playing
with your expectations of</i>

01:04:31.493 --> 01:04:33.291
where you're supposed
to be in a movie,

01:04:33.370 --> 01:04:35.464
where you're supposed to
be in a Hitchcock movie,

01:04:35.538 --> 01:04:37.666
where you're supposed to
be in a Universal movie.

01:04:51.596 --> 01:04:55.271
<i>You can argue the value
of Janet Leigh's performance.</i>

01:04:55.350 --> 01:04:56.772
<i>You can say, "Well,
that's a little flat,</i>

01:04:56.851 --> 01:04:59.400
<i>"it's a little this,
that's a little Kabuki."</i>

01:04:59.479 --> 01:05:03.700
Maybe all of those things
are leading you to believe

01:05:04.484 --> 01:05:06.703
as an audience member

01:05:06.778 --> 01:05:09.281
there's a bigger
cumulative effect.

01:05:09.989 --> 01:05:12.037
<i>She's servicing
an expectation.</i>

01:05:12.826 --> 01:05:15.545
<i>The best scenes for me are
the ones he must have spent time on,</i>

01:05:16.121 --> 01:05:17.589
the driving shots.

01:05:17.664 --> 01:05:19.917
You had to have
spent time on those,

01:05:21.167 --> 01:05:23.090
<i>particularly the points
of view somehow.</i>

01:05:24.546 --> 01:05:28.346
<i>And the framing of Janet Leigh
in the center of the frame</i>

01:05:28.425 --> 01:05:31.304
<i>with the top of the steering wheel
in the bottom of the frame.</i>

01:05:31.803 --> 01:05:34.022
'Cause you can make a choice, you
can go above the steering wheel.

01:05:35.014 --> 01:05:36.766
You know, or you
can go further out.

01:05:36.850 --> 01:05:38.944
But then maybe you won't
see her eyes as well.

01:05:39.018 --> 01:05:40.941
So that's like
the perfect size.

01:05:46.734 --> 01:05:48.361
In quite a hurry?

01:05:48.820 --> 01:05:51.118
Yes, I didn't intend
to sleep so long.

01:05:51.656 --> 01:05:53.454
I almost had an
accident last night.

01:05:53.533 --> 01:05:55.126
<i>The scene
with the policeman.</i>

01:05:55.201 --> 01:05:59.297
Of course, the framing of
him staring into the car...

01:05:59.372 --> 01:06:01.215
Yes, we know with
the glasses, he's scary.

01:06:04.169 --> 01:06:07.389
<i>But there's something about the
restraint of those frames.</i>

01:06:09.924 --> 01:06:12.803
See? And the more
you restrain,

01:06:12.886 --> 01:06:15.184
the better it is when
the explosion happens.

01:06:18.725 --> 01:06:20.147
<i>And on the way
to the explosion,</i>

01:06:20.226 --> 01:06:23.230
there are these meditative states.
Driving...

01:06:24.898 --> 01:06:27.401
<i>Caroline,
get Mr. Cassidy for me.</i>

01:06:30.111 --> 01:06:33.786
<i>After all, Cassidy,
I told you, all that cash...</i>

01:06:33.907 --> 01:06:37.377
And there's a sense of movement
ahead, movement ahead...

01:06:43.917 --> 01:06:45.840
<i>She steals money.</i>

01:06:45.919 --> 01:06:47.842
Then she decides
to drive away.

01:06:47.921 --> 01:06:50.219
<i>Then she becomes
guilty about it.</i>

01:06:51.090 --> 01:06:53.684
Gee, I'm sorry, I didn't
hear you in all this rain.

01:06:53.760 --> 01:06:55.057
Then she meets
this guy in a motel,

01:06:55.136 --> 01:06:56.433
and he's telling her
all his problems.

01:06:57.430 --> 01:06:59.273
A few years ago,
Mother met this man.

01:06:59.807 --> 01:07:02.526
And he talked her into
building this motel.

01:07:02.602 --> 01:07:04.104
<i>You're watching,
you wanna know what happens.</i>

01:07:04.187 --> 01:07:05.734
<i>Is she gonna bring
that money back?</i>

01:07:05.813 --> 01:07:07.815
Now what is Anthony Perkins
really gonna do?

01:07:08.816 --> 01:07:10.614
You know, he has
his mother there.

01:07:10.693 --> 01:07:11.694
Maybe there's gonna
be this whole thing

01:07:11.778 --> 01:07:13.121
going on with the mother
and him and her.

01:07:13.404 --> 01:07:16.578
When he died too, it was just
too great a shock for her.

01:07:18.117 --> 01:07:20.415
<i>I mean, you're really...
You're taken down a path,</i>

01:07:20.495 --> 01:07:21.496
<i>but what's great
about it is that</i>

01:07:21.955 --> 01:07:24.925
all your expectations are
taken and turned upside down.

01:07:29.963 --> 01:07:31.590
<i>You know,
there are certain rules,</i>

01:07:31.673 --> 01:07:34.096
and he pulled the pin
and rolled a grenade

01:07:34.175 --> 01:07:36.553
into the middle of
that conference room

01:07:36.636 --> 01:07:38.809
and destroyed
all those rules.

01:07:44.143 --> 01:07:47.738
<i>The camera is very
much with Marion, right?</i>

01:07:47.814 --> 01:07:49.191
Even to the point
where you have that

01:07:49.274 --> 01:07:50.992
very famous shot
of the showerhead.

01:07:53.695 --> 01:07:56.915
All of a sudden,
you go from Marion,

01:07:56.990 --> 01:08:00.085
and the camera is then
in this very strange place

01:08:00.159 --> 01:08:02.628
<i>where you see
both her showering,</i>

01:08:02.704 --> 01:08:06.459
<i>and the shadowy figure behind
that kind of Visqueen curtain.</i>

01:08:12.839 --> 01:08:15.638
He did it with an eye
towards having to shift

01:08:15.717 --> 01:08:19.062
point of view
35 minutes into the film.

01:08:24.017 --> 01:08:27.270
<i>The very first
screening of that film,</i>

01:08:27.353 --> 01:08:30.448
<i>none of us had a clue
what was gonna happen.</i>

01:08:36.321 --> 01:08:40.451
And when that murder,
that shower scene came,

01:08:40.533 --> 01:08:42.661
I've never seen an
audience react like that.

01:08:43.745 --> 01:08:47.875
You could hear a sustained shriek
from the audience downstairs.

01:08:47.957 --> 01:08:51.301
It wasn't like... Ahh! Ahh!
Ahh! It was like... Ahh!

01:08:51.377 --> 01:08:53.004
Like they wanted
to close it out.

01:08:55.798 --> 01:08:58.392
But they couldn't
stop watching it.

01:08:58.676 --> 01:09:00.599
You wanted to close your
eyes, but you couldn't.

01:09:02.930 --> 01:09:05.558
Hitch was right, you didn't
have to build suspense anymore,

01:09:05.642 --> 01:09:07.314
they were...

01:09:07.393 --> 01:09:10.317
They were blithering idiots.

01:09:10.395 --> 01:09:12.899
The audience was like,
"What happened?"

01:09:12.982 --> 01:09:14.073
They couldn't believe
what happened.

01:09:14.149 --> 01:09:16.152
They kept thinking,
"It couldn't have happened.

01:09:16.234 --> 01:09:18.283
"She's gonna be alive."

01:09:18.363 --> 01:09:21.662
It was... Every impulse that
you have going to the movies,

01:09:21.741 --> 01:09:25.587
it was the first time that going
to the movies was dangerous.

01:09:28.331 --> 01:09:31.380
<i>Seven days, 70 setups.</i>

01:09:32.585 --> 01:09:35.839
<i>I used a nude girl a lot,</i>

01:09:35.921 --> 01:09:39.267
<i>and I shot some of it
in slow motion.</i>

01:09:40.134 --> 01:09:42.886
<i>Because of
covering the breasts,</i>

01:09:42.970 --> 01:09:44.438
<i>you couldn't do it quick...</i>

01:09:44.514 --> 01:09:46.767
<i>You couldn't
measure it correctly.</i>

01:09:50.435 --> 01:09:54.782
That's when you feel like this guy
really has his finger on the pulse of,

01:09:54.857 --> 01:09:57.610
not only just audience response,
but the world in general,

01:09:57.694 --> 01:09:59.867
that the world was ready
for a film like that.

01:09:59.946 --> 01:10:01.323
It didn't know it was,
but it was.

01:10:02.740 --> 01:10:04.788
<i>This was a small story.</i>

01:10:04.867 --> 01:10:09.338
<i>But it represented probably something
much larger on the horizon.</i>

01:10:15.169 --> 01:10:18.514
<i>At that time as it is
now, we expect certain things.</i>

01:10:19.132 --> 01:10:20.805
And it took storytelling
at that time and says,

01:10:20.883 --> 01:10:23.477
"No, I'm not gonna
give you that.

01:10:23.553 --> 01:10:24.896
"I'm gonna give you
something else."

01:10:24.971 --> 01:10:26.143
Because you think
everything is so cool.

01:10:26.222 --> 01:10:29.897
You're at the end of the '50s, the
'60s are gonna look glorious to us.

01:10:35.356 --> 01:10:38.781
<i>I think it was really important
for who we were then.</i>

01:10:40.695 --> 01:10:43.699
<i>You have Vietnam,
you have world revolution,</i>

01:10:43.781 --> 01:10:46.204
<i>you have everything
that happened in the '60s,</i>

01:10:46.284 --> 01:10:49.003
<i>and the society has
never been the same.</i>

01:10:49.579 --> 01:10:53.004
<i>That picture really touched
upon that, I think, Psycho.</i>

01:10:57.378 --> 01:11:00.848
<i>Of course, you want everything
so neat and wrapped up.</i>

01:11:01.257 --> 01:11:02.804
Well, life isn't like that.

01:11:02.884 --> 01:11:05.012
Even the stories I'm gonna tell
you are not like that now.

01:11:07.388 --> 01:11:10.107
<i>My main satisfaction</i> is...

01:11:11.934 --> 01:11:15.108
<i>...the film did something
to an audience.</i>

01:11:15.188 --> 01:11:16.610
<i>I really mean that.</i>

01:11:16.689 --> 01:11:21.411
<i>And in many ways, I feel my
satisfaction with our...</i>

01:11:21.486 --> 01:11:26.242
<i>Our art achieves something</i>

01:11:26.824 --> 01:11:29.919
<i>of a mass emotion.</i>

01:11:32.705 --> 01:11:34.833
<i>It wasn't a message,</i>

01:11:34.916 --> 01:11:38.671
<i>it wasn't some
great performance,</i>

01:11:38.753 --> 01:11:44.260
<i>it wasn't a highly appreciated
novel that stirred an audience.</i>

01:11:48.346 --> 01:11:50.348
<i>It was pure film.</i>

01:11:53.059 --> 01:11:56.063
<i>People will say, "What a
terrible thing to make."</i>

01:11:56.646 --> 01:11:59.149
<i>The subject was horrible,</i>

01:11:59.232 --> 01:12:01.109
<i>the people were small,</i>

01:12:01.192 --> 01:12:03.365
<i>there were
no characters in it.</i>

01:12:03.444 --> 01:12:05.071
<i>I know all this.</i>

01:12:05.655 --> 01:12:08.329
<i>But I know one thing,</i>

01:12:08.407 --> 01:12:14.335
<i>the use of film in
constructing this story</i>

01:12:14.413 --> 01:12:17.542
<i>caused audiences
all over the world</i>

01:12:19.252 --> 01:12:23.302
<i>to react and
become emotional.</i>

01:12:23.506 --> 01:12:26.259
<i>My only pride in the picture</i>

01:12:26.342 --> 01:12:31.564
<i>is that the picture
belongs to filmmakers.</i>

01:12:31.806 --> 01:12:35.231
<i>It belongs to us, you and I.</i>

01:12:39.939 --> 01:12:42.158
<i>Yes, how do
you want to handle this?</i>

01:12:42.483 --> 01:12:44.827
<i>I am the cameraman,
you are the director.</i>

01:12:44.902 --> 01:12:46.950
<i>And you are directing
a double portrait</i>

01:12:47.029 --> 01:12:50.158
<i>of a Mr. Hitchcock
and of a Mr. Truffaut.</i>

01:12:50.241 --> 01:12:52.744
<i>Whatever you want,
any idea that comes into...</i>

01:12:52.827 --> 01:12:56.422
<i>Really, it's my directing Mr.
Truffaut, isn't it?</i>

01:12:57.498 --> 01:13:00.047
<i>Yes, but you
direct also yourself.</i>

01:13:00.126 --> 01:13:02.970
<i>Ah, I got
what you want. Okay.</i>

01:13:04.630 --> 01:13:06.382
<i>You
look less worried than he is.</i>

01:13:06.465 --> 01:13:08.888
Now, here we are.
<i>Look,</i> here's the angle.

01:13:09.135 --> 01:13:11.012
<i>Now, I'm gonna be
like this, you see.</i>

01:13:11.095 --> 01:13:14.770
<i>Now, Mr. Truffaut should half
turn around and look back to me.</i>

01:13:17.101 --> 01:13:18.444
<i>Like this.
You see, then?</i>

01:13:23.858 --> 01:13:25.952
<i>We better not
have cigars, you are right.</i>

01:13:26.027 --> 01:13:29.122
<i>Otherwise, it might make us
look like movie directors.</i>

01:13:29.196 --> 01:13:31.494
<i>And God forbid
we ever look like that.</i>

01:13:44.003 --> 01:13:48.804
<i>The conversation that began
in 1962 extended far beyond the book,</i>

01:13:49.216 --> 01:13:51.344
<i>and bloomed into a real friendship.</i>

01:13:58.851 --> 01:14:02.651
<i>Hitchcock and Truffaut spoke and
wrote to each other constantly.</i>

01:14:05.942 --> 01:14:07.285
<i>They read
each other's scripts,</i>

01:14:07.360 --> 01:14:09.613
<i>made story and casting suggestions,
and screened each other's films.</i>

01:14:16.744 --> 01:14:20.749
<i>After the first edition of the
book was published in 1966,</i>

01:14:21.332 --> 01:14:24.927
<i>Truffaut made a movie a year,
sometimes two.</i>

01:14:29.048 --> 01:14:31.767
<i>Hitchcock made
only three more films.</i>

01:14:34.637 --> 01:14:38.312
<i>Right to the end, he was haunted by the
question he had raised with Truffaut.</i>

01:14:40.101 --> 01:14:43.526
<i>"Should I have experimented more
with character and narrative?</i>

01:14:45.940 --> 01:14:48.409
<i>"Did I become a prisoner
of my own form?"</i>

01:14:57.785 --> 01:14:59.913
<i>The same old questions
still swirled around him.</i>

01:15:01.580 --> 01:15:04.083
<i>Was he an artist
or an entertainer?</i>

01:15:06.085 --> 01:15:08.554
<i>Could anyone really
claim to be an artist,</i>

01:15:08.629 --> 01:15:11.303
<i>working within the factory
conditions of Hollywood?</i>

01:15:15.511 --> 01:15:18.435
<i>In America, you call
this man "Hitch."</i>

01:15:19.306 --> 01:15:22.685
<i>In France, we call him
"Monsieur Hitchcock."</i>

01:15:32.862 --> 01:15:36.958
<i>"Two weeks after the American Film
Institute tribute," wrote Truffaut,</i>

01:15:37.783 --> 01:15:40.912
<i>"resigned to the fact that he
would never shoot another film,</i>

01:15:41.412 --> 01:15:45.883
<i>"Hitchcock closed his office,
dismissed his staff, and went home."</i>

01:15:53.507 --> 01:15:58.934
<i>Frangois Truffaut's energy and his
love of cinema seemed inexhaustible.</i>

01:16:00.681 --> 01:16:03.855
<i>The idea that he would
be dead at the age of 52,</i>

01:16:04.477 --> 01:16:08.448
<i>only four years after
Hitchcock, was unthinkable.</i>

01:16:09.982 --> 01:16:11.825
<i>It still is.</i>

01:16:16.822 --> 01:16:19.666
<i>The last completed
project of Truffaut's life,</i>

01:16:20.034 --> 01:16:25.086
<i>published a few months before he died,
was an updated edition of his book,</i>

01:16:25.164 --> 01:16:28.338
<i>in which he gave us
Alfred Hitchcock.</i>

01:16:29.168 --> 01:16:33.344
<i>Not the television star,
not the Master of Suspense,</i>

01:16:34.423 --> 01:16:38.644
<i>but Alfred Hitchcock the artist,
who wrote with the camera.</i>

01:16:46.185 --> 01:16:48.187
Isuppose...

01:16:48.270 --> 01:16:51.740
<i>...the films
with atmosphere,</i>

01:16:52.191 --> 01:16:54.410
<i>suspense and incident</i>

01:16:54.485 --> 01:16:58.581
<i>are really my creations
as a writer.</i>

01:17:33.858 --> 01:17:35.075
Sure, yeah.

01:17:45.578 --> 01:17:47.080
<i>Sure, that's right.</i>
