02:57.969 --> 03:00.305
Welcome, brother.

03:00.805 --> 03:02.765
Liberator!

03:02.849 --> 03:05.101
Our hero!

04:18.758 --> 04:20.426
Welcome, young men.

04:20.927 --> 04:22.512
Thank God you are safe.

04:23.179 --> 04:24.013
Come on...

04:24.722 --> 04:26.057
there is nothing to fear.

04:26.140 --> 04:28.059
Go inside, that way.

04:34.983 --> 04:38.820
Brother Zaid is a good man. A teacher.

04:38.903 --> 04:40.405
We studied together.

04:40.863 --> 04:44.200
He is going to offer
you young men food and shelter,

04:44.284 --> 04:45.827
for as long as you need.

04:45.910 --> 04:47.620
You will not be in need of anything.

04:47.704 --> 04:48.705
Sheikh Zaid!

04:55.795 --> 04:57.046
Please come in.

04:59.674 --> 05:00.758
Stay here.

05:01.217 --> 05:02.885
The Sheikh will come visit you soon.

05:02.969 --> 05:04.262
I'm not to leave?

05:05.054 --> 05:07.974
It's for your protection.
There are threats against you.

05:08.433 --> 05:11.602
Not just the Israelis,
but Muslim brothers, too,

05:11.686 --> 05:13.187
who don't like your "al-Masih."

05:14.605 --> 05:17.191
It's from all sides. I'm sorry.

05:17.734 --> 05:19.152
But you'll be safer here.

05:19.235 --> 05:20.570
What about the others?

05:22.113 --> 05:23.156
They are not you.

08:23.961 --> 08:24.962
Brother.

08:26.797 --> 08:28.174
Something troubles you.

08:28.424 --> 08:30.009
It's nothing.

08:33.012 --> 08:34.639
You've trimmed your beard.

08:39.101 --> 08:41.479
Perhaps we have both changed.

08:44.774 --> 08:47.985
These boys will study
and learn, like we did.

08:49.695 --> 08:51.864
They will find purpose here, God willing.

09:03.960 --> 09:05.920
It was good of you to bring them.

19:15.821 --> 19:17.281
You are brave, my sons.

19:19.366 --> 19:21.535
It was not easy
to resist that cursed man...

19:23.620 --> 19:24.788
that deceiver.

19:26.623 --> 19:28.959
He could be the false messiah.

19:30.460 --> 19:31.587
God, protect us!

19:32.588 --> 19:33.881
His followers are doomed...

19:34.256 --> 19:36.383
in this life and the next.

19:37.092 --> 19:39.303
But you are strong, are you not?

19:39.386 --> 19:40.262
Yes!

19:42.639 --> 19:43.724
That's right.

19:47.269 --> 19:48.520
You are strong.

20:30.604 --> 20:32.064
Peace be upon you.

20:34.942 --> 20:36.568
Peace be upon you, Sheikh.

20:37.569 --> 20:38.779
How are you, my son?

20:40.364 --> 20:42.074
Why do you call me your son?

20:42.824 --> 20:44.826
I wish you were, Jibril.

20:45.494 --> 20:47.621
God honors you.

20:48.705 --> 20:52.084
And you have done great things,
despite your youth.

20:53.001 --> 20:57.047
Everything you've done
for your nation... it's astonishing.

20:58.674 --> 20:59.841
It wasn't just me.

21:00.509 --> 21:03.845
I have heard otherwise. But, no matter.

21:06.515 --> 21:07.808
Now...

21:09.518 --> 21:10.852
Please, sit.

21:20.028 --> 21:24.032
Do you have a sense of your plan,
in the future?

21:27.327 --> 21:29.329
I will trust al-Masih's plan...

21:30.038 --> 21:31.039
whatever it is.

21:32.291 --> 21:36.086
My son, I'm not asking for his plan.
I'm asking for yours.

21:37.462 --> 21:39.089
What is your will, Jibril?

21:42.634 --> 21:43.719
My will?

38:03.364 --> 38:04.865
False Prophet.
