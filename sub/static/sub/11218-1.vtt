[theme music]

00:33.834 --> 00:36.537
(Mendoza)
Hey! Sherman.

00:36.604 --> 00:38.972
Poster boy, come on, man.
This is your night.

00:39.039 --> 00:41.209
Oh, no, no, no.
I'm done, man.

00:41.275 --> 00:42.510
I'm done.
Hey, hey, hey.

00:42.576 --> 00:45.879
(Mendoza)
'Your night.'

00:45.946 --> 00:47.348
(female #1)
Party! Yeah!

00:47.415 --> 00:50.151
Alright.
Enjoy it, Sherman.

00:50.218 --> 00:53.354
[indistinct chatter]

00:57.057 --> 00:58.392
[helicopter whirring]

00:59.960 --> 01:01.595
[all screaming]

01:01.662 --> 01:05.533
Whoa! Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:05.599 --> 01:07.801
(male narrator)
We hold cops
to a higher standard

01:07.868 --> 01:10.304
because we give them
a gun and a badge.

01:10.371 --> 01:12.340
Only trouble with that is
they're recruited

01:12.406 --> 01:14.975
from the human race.

01:15.042 --> 01:17.578
[baby crying]

01:27.655 --> 01:29.923
[crying continues]

01:29.990 --> 01:31.725
Little man can eat.

01:31.792 --> 01:34.362
Yeah, you pick him up
every time he cries.

01:34.428 --> 01:38.766
Well, I'll sleep-train a baby
if I know his tummy is full.

01:38.832 --> 01:41.034
But he might've gone
a little bit longer

01:41.101 --> 01:43.204
if you fed him on both sides.

01:43.271 --> 01:45.373
Yeah. I thought
he was done, okay?

01:45.439 --> 01:47.541
Are you getting
any sleep at all?

01:47.608 --> 01:50.744
Yeah. From about 4 to 4:25.

01:52.079 --> 01:54.615
Look, I-I gotta go.

01:56.450 --> 01:58.919
Oh, I don't know
how you do it.

01:58.986 --> 02:04.258
From nursing a baby
to examining a corpse?

02:04.325 --> 02:07.328
- Must feel strange.
- Which part?

02:08.862 --> 02:10.831
It is a rape, actually.

02:10.898 --> 02:14.202
(Enid)
'Oh, you know, there's
only 6 ounces in the fridge.'

02:14.268 --> 02:17.671
There are four bags
in the freezer.

02:27.815 --> 02:30.284
Morning.

02:30.351 --> 02:33.987
(Caesar)
'So I've been thinking..'

02:34.054 --> 02:36.557
...maybe April..

02:36.624 --> 02:39.893
'...we rent a house
in Palm Springs.'

02:39.960 --> 02:42.896
Use up some of your days.

02:42.963 --> 02:44.798
I don't know.

02:44.865 --> 02:46.667
'No, you never do'.

02:46.734 --> 02:50.571
[laughing]
You serious? We're gonna have
that conversation--

02:50.638 --> 02:52.640
'It's not just the house,
you know it.'

02:52.706 --> 02:54.342
- Oh, God.
- I'm 36 years old.

02:54.408 --> 02:55.543
It's been three years.

02:55.609 --> 02:57.578
Are we just two guys
banging each other?

02:57.645 --> 03:02.082
- Please stop moving my gun?
- Stop leaving it by the bed.

03:02.149 --> 03:03.751
'Maybe we want kids. Huh?'

03:03.817 --> 03:05.386
'Some real meaning
in our lives.'

03:05.453 --> 03:07.221
'If we're gonna say,
"screw all that"'

03:07.288 --> 03:10.057
'let's at least
do it together.'

03:10.123 --> 03:12.326
I like things
the way they are.

03:12.393 --> 03:14.395
How many times
have I gotta say that?

03:14.462 --> 03:17.197
'At this rate,
not many more.'

03:20.067 --> 03:21.402
[door slams]

03:31.245 --> 03:34.648
(man on radio)
'You know that they say
when you actually use coupons'

03:34.715 --> 03:37.918
'it's-it's almost like
an endorphin release.'

03:37.985 --> 03:41.221
'It's sort of like even using
drugs or eating a good meal.'

03:41.289 --> 03:45.025
'It makes people feel good,
physically, using coupons.'

03:45.092 --> 03:46.660
'Don't know if you knew that?'

03:54.067 --> 03:57.605
(man on radio)
'Whatever, uh, however good
you feel, the guy behind you'

03:57.671 --> 03:59.307
'doubles that in depression.'

04:05.946 --> 04:08.549
'I got screwed the other day.
I was in Vons.'

04:08.616 --> 04:12.753
'And this lady behind me
had two items, right?'

04:12.820 --> 04:15.623
'I got like a cart full
of crap, so I say'

04:15.689 --> 04:17.190
'"You wanna
go ahead of me?"'

04:17.257 --> 04:21.295
And she goes, "Oh, you know,
okay, sure. I'd love to."

04:21.362 --> 04:23.163
- 'They're both returns.'
- 'Oh, no.'

04:23.230 --> 04:25.399
'She's returning
a dairy product.'

04:34.342 --> 04:36.043
- You're late.
- Yeah, I know.

04:36.109 --> 04:38.879
I know. I'm sorry. Fountain was
a total piece of shit.

04:38.946 --> 04:42.115
Might wanna, you know,
plan for that next time.

04:42.182 --> 04:44.685
Seriously.
And watch your mouth.

04:44.752 --> 04:45.686
Hey, buddy.

04:45.753 --> 04:47.455
- Hi.
- What's happening?

04:47.521 --> 04:49.723
I know you want
mommy's sunglasses

04:49.790 --> 04:51.992
but she needs them
when she drives, okay?

04:52.059 --> 04:55.596
- Okay? There you go.
- It's alright. It's alright.

04:55.663 --> 04:57.665
- Still with the one shoe?
- Oh, Sammy, please.

04:57.731 --> 05:00.534
You know he doesn't like
to wear shoes in the car.

05:00.601 --> 05:02.636
'I've got it right here.
We were rushing.'

05:02.703 --> 05:05.573
What's with
the crappy car seat? Huh?

05:05.639 --> 05:07.575
Read the ratings.
It's not safe.

05:07.641 --> 05:10.210
The other one is $200,
and I can't afford it. Okay?

05:10.277 --> 05:14.648
What, it's not worth it?
Where's my child support going?

05:14.715 --> 05:18.719
See. This isn't how daddy should
speak to your mommy. Okay?

05:18.786 --> 05:20.454
(Bryant)
'Come on.'

05:26.394 --> 05:28.696
Whoa, whoa.
Whoa, Sammy.

05:28.762 --> 05:30.698
Really, you're drinking
in the morning?

05:30.764 --> 05:33.801
- What?
- You smell like a brewery.

05:33.867 --> 05:36.437
What the hell are you, are-are
you taking video right now?

05:36.504 --> 05:39.573
Hey, um, you're acting a little
paranoid. Can you calm down?

05:39.640 --> 05:41.709
Acting paranoid?
What are you doing?

05:41.775 --> 05:44.344
What kinda sick person tries
to bait her kid's father

05:44.412 --> 05:45.913
into taking a swing at her.

05:45.979 --> 05:48.348
- You're talking about violence.
- You're a fit mother, Tammi.

05:48.416 --> 05:50.017
- Whoa, calm down. Okay?
- Calm down.

05:50.083 --> 05:53.286
No one's talking about taking a
swing at anybody except for you.

05:53.353 --> 05:57.190
Well...you need
to get some help.

05:57.257 --> 05:58.892
- Back away. Okay?
- Crazy.

05:58.959 --> 06:00.093
You just back away.

06:06.333 --> 06:09.437
Hey.
Another rough night?

06:09.503 --> 06:12.540
Well, you still,
you-you still look alright.

06:12.606 --> 06:14.675
Liar.
What happened?

06:14.742 --> 06:17.978
Anonymous 911 call, 3:36 a.m.

06:18.045 --> 06:21.014
'Said they saw a man
in a red jacket raping someone'

06:21.081 --> 06:22.850
who looked dead.

06:22.916 --> 06:24.952
Left no other information,
just hung up.

06:25.018 --> 06:29.723
- Suspect left his pants?
- Those are our victim's.

06:29.790 --> 06:33.761
Eighteen years old, Latino,
male. Armando Guillera. Yeah.

06:33.827 --> 06:36.129
EMT said when they found him,
he was unconscious.

06:36.196 --> 06:39.032
Naked from the waist down
and bleeding.

06:39.099 --> 06:40.434
[phone ringing]

06:44.738 --> 06:48.408
Hey, what's wrong?

06:48.476 --> 06:53.013
Okay, he took
the whole bottle.

06:53.080 --> 06:55.783
Mom, I don't need to get
the play-by-play, okay?

06:55.849 --> 06:59.152
Just call me
when something's wrong. Bye.

07:02.490 --> 07:05.559
Hey, you're, uh,
you're...leaking.

07:12.165 --> 07:13.701
So I'm sure you all heard
patrol shot and killed a suspect

07:13.767 --> 07:16.737
last night in a foot chase
on East Romaine.

07:16.804 --> 07:18.338
'Turned out he was unarmed.'

07:18.405 --> 07:20.974
'Officers fired three rounds
when they saw him reaching'

07:21.041 --> 07:22.209
'for his waistband.'

07:22.275 --> 07:24.645
He was probably trying
to keep his pants up.

07:24.712 --> 07:26.446
You sag, you gag, baby.

07:26.514 --> 07:29.483
(Hill)
'You cut me off again, Dudek,
you'll hump the pine'

07:29.550 --> 07:31.084
till you get hemorrhoids.

07:31.151 --> 07:33.654
Anyone else shares his views,
keep it to yourself.

07:33.721 --> 07:36.890
This is the second fatal
shooting of an unarmed teen

07:36.957 --> 07:40.293
in six weeks,
in the same hood

07:40.360 --> 07:42.730
so tensions
are off the chart.

07:42.796 --> 07:45.666
'Use your heads out there
when engaging the community.'

07:45.733 --> 07:49.036
'Safety first,
but restraint when possible.'

07:49.102 --> 07:50.571
'Now, roll out.'

07:53.674 --> 07:55.843
Fill up the tank.
I'll be down in five.

07:55.909 --> 07:57.678
I checked.
It's 3/4 full.

07:57.745 --> 08:00.814
How about your Taser? You got
half a charge in that too?

08:00.881 --> 08:04.017
- Fill up the tank, Steele.
- Yes, sir.

08:06.654 --> 08:08.756
Everything alright?

08:08.822 --> 08:11.559
Yeah. Kid's a little salty,
getting under my skin.

08:11.625 --> 08:13.594
'Why do you let him go
short sleeves?'

08:13.661 --> 08:16.897
- I didn't.
- 'Hey, you wanna trade?'

08:16.964 --> 08:19.600
I'll take the ex-soldier that
can bench press a Volkswagen.

08:19.667 --> 08:22.102
You can have
my little 99-pound rice cake.

08:22.169 --> 08:25.573
Before you say no, she's a black
belt when it comes to leafing

08:25.639 --> 08:28.075
through the manual
and fiddling with her hair bun.

08:28.141 --> 08:29.843
Toosh!

08:29.910 --> 08:31.411
I can wire
that up, Cooper.

08:31.478 --> 08:34.247
You don't think you can get
his mind right, huh?

08:34.314 --> 08:37.350
Thank you, sir. Uh..

08:37.417 --> 08:39.086
I'll handle him.

08:39.152 --> 08:43.490
(captain)
'And on March 13, 2012, a
suspect shot into their cruiser'

08:43.557 --> 08:45.793
'injuring his partner,
officer Bryant'

08:45.859 --> 08:47.795
'but this did not deter him.'

08:47.861 --> 08:50.063
'It just increased
his vigilance.'

08:50.130 --> 08:54.134
'Then a week later, on patrol,
supported by Officer Ferguson'

08:54.201 --> 08:56.269
'he encountered
the suspect again.'

08:56.336 --> 08:59.172
In the foot chase that followed,
he was forced to shoot

08:59.239 --> 09:02.342
and kill the suspect when
the suspect pulled a gun.

09:02.409 --> 09:03.844
So for his courage

09:03.911 --> 09:06.413
and protecting the people
of Los Angeles

09:06.479 --> 09:08.348
'I am proud to award him today'

09:08.415 --> 09:12.152
'with the Police Star for
bravery, Officer Ben Sherman.'

09:12.219 --> 09:13.587
[all applauding]

09:13.654 --> 09:15.022
Thank you, sir.

09:15.088 --> 09:16.690
Thank you.

09:20.761 --> 09:22.930
Thank you, sir. Thank you.
It's an honor.

09:22.996 --> 09:24.965
- Hey, what can youdo?
- I don't know.

09:25.032 --> 09:27.134
Great news. Looks like
your face will be

09:27.200 --> 09:29.002
appearing on all our
new recruiting materials.

09:29.069 --> 09:31.071
- Okay? Good.
- Thank you. That's terrific.

09:31.138 --> 09:32.505
- They asked.
- No, no.

09:32.572 --> 09:34.775
I gotta get used to
riding with a celeb.

09:34.842 --> 09:36.409
What's next?
"Dancing With The Stars"?

09:36.476 --> 09:37.811
- Sherman.
- Hey.

09:37.878 --> 09:40.814
There is a party tonight
in your honor.

09:40.881 --> 09:43.150
Hey, don't go wide.
Just our circle.

09:43.216 --> 09:45.085
- Congrats.
- Yeah. Thanks a lot.

09:45.152 --> 09:46.519
Appreciate it.

09:46.586 --> 09:49.723
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Whoa! That's cool.

09:51.058 --> 09:55.062
- 'Right there, 2 o'clock.'
- Good eye, Steele.

09:57.330 --> 09:58.999
Shouldn't we hook her up?

09:59.066 --> 10:01.534
What? Scrape the dope
off her shoe

10:01.601 --> 10:03.671
for a weak felony
the DA will toss?

10:03.737 --> 10:05.372
'I thought we were
about enforcement.'

10:05.438 --> 10:08.008
We are.
We're the brain.

10:08.075 --> 10:10.010
'Got to learn to fish,
Steele.'

10:10.077 --> 10:12.646
'That one...you throw back.'

10:12.713 --> 10:15.482
- Whoop-whoop!
- This is a different war, huh?

10:15.548 --> 10:17.685
They hate us there,
they hate us here.

10:17.751 --> 10:22.122
If you wanted to be liked,
you should have been a fireman.

10:22.189 --> 10:23.824
Hey!

10:23.891 --> 10:26.860
Get over here.

10:26.927 --> 10:29.697
Come close to my car
'cause you want to shoot me?

10:29.763 --> 10:31.131
- No. No, sir.
- No? No, sir?

10:31.198 --> 10:32.966
We got religion
all of a sudden.

10:33.033 --> 10:36.436
You toss the gun? I could've
sworn I saw you toss something.

10:36.503 --> 10:38.338
- No. No, sir.
- No?

10:38.405 --> 10:40.573
The veryleast, I got you
for impeding traffic.

10:40.640 --> 10:43.977
- Should I haul your ass in?
- No, sir. Please, please.

10:47.147 --> 10:49.817
Get on your bike
and get out of here.

11:06.433 --> 11:08.201
(Steele)
'We ignore
the obvious drug offense'

11:08.268 --> 11:10.337
but you make that kid
shit his pants?

11:10.403 --> 11:14.107
Our crack whore
will be here tomorrow.

11:14.174 --> 11:16.376
Now, there's a chance
that kid won't be.

11:16.443 --> 11:19.947
(woman on radio)
'A57. Neighbor reports seeing
a man brandishing a knife'

11:20.013 --> 11:24.051
'through the window
of a house at 4848 Coyle.'

11:24.117 --> 11:27.354
A57. Show us responding.
Code three.

11:27.420 --> 11:28.756
[woman screaming]

11:31.925 --> 11:34.561
(Cooper)
'A57. Show us code six.'

11:34.627 --> 11:35.763
[woman continues screaming]

11:35.829 --> 11:37.965
Hey.
Hey!

11:39.499 --> 11:40.968
Holy shit!

11:42.635 --> 11:43.804
Fuck.

11:43.871 --> 11:46.406
[man and woman screaming]

11:47.707 --> 11:49.042
[woman screaming]

11:53.713 --> 11:56.850
- Jerry. Shit.
- Don't shoot!

11:56.917 --> 11:58.986
Don't shoot me.

11:59.052 --> 12:00.553
(Steele)
'It's a joke?'

12:00.620 --> 12:03.690
Sure. The final cut will be.

12:03.757 --> 12:05.225
'Get up, numb nuts.'

12:05.292 --> 12:07.494
'You almost had a real nightmare
in your hands.'

12:07.560 --> 12:09.729
I told you, Jerry.
We should've told the neighbors.

12:09.797 --> 12:13.666
I wanted their real reactions.
It sucks when things look fake.

12:13.733 --> 12:16.303
You know
what else sucks, Jerry?

12:16.369 --> 12:18.471
It sucks when people
are robbed and raped

12:18.538 --> 12:21.741
while the cops are out dealing
with a bunch of rich kids

12:21.809 --> 12:23.376
'who are making
a C-minus horror flick'

12:23.443 --> 12:25.578
'because they think
it's gonna make them famous.'

12:25.645 --> 12:29.582
- Hey, okay, we have a permit.
- To be a dip shit?

12:29.649 --> 12:33.420
You want that shoved up your
ass? You turn it off right now.

12:33.486 --> 12:36.023
You have a nice day.

12:39.092 --> 12:40.227
Officer.

12:41.829 --> 12:43.330
Yes, Jerry?

12:43.396 --> 12:48.268
Could you guys, if we rolled,
possibly drive up again?

12:48.335 --> 12:49.937
No, Jerry. No.

12:50.003 --> 12:52.005
I'll put your names
in the credits.

12:52.072 --> 12:55.408
Oh, and maybe take out
your guns.

12:55.475 --> 12:58.111
Oh, yeah. Why not,
why-why just take them out?

12:58.178 --> 13:00.013
Yeah, why not
pistol-whip you, too?

13:00.080 --> 13:02.082
- 'Steele. Steele.'
- Don't worry. It'll look real.

13:02.149 --> 13:03.583
- Seriously, let's go! Action!
- 'Hey!'

13:03.650 --> 13:04.918
- 'Hey!'
- Somebody call it!

13:04.985 --> 13:06.453
Let's go.

13:14.761 --> 13:16.897
Have a nice day, Jerry.

13:19.732 --> 13:22.002
(Bryant)
'Now, not only do I have to pay
for the entire custody battle'

13:22.069 --> 13:25.839
'that bitch is trying to make me
look like a wife beater'

13:25.906 --> 13:27.640
so she can win custody.

13:27.707 --> 13:29.242
- On my nickel!
- 'Yeah.'

13:29.309 --> 13:31.711
- Is that messed up or what?
- Yeah. Watch the road.

13:31.778 --> 13:35.715
She looked like crap, like she'd
been sniffing glue all night.

13:35.782 --> 13:38.585
I know that the law
favors mothers. I know that.

13:38.651 --> 13:42.522
'But Tammi is not a mother.
She's just an egg donor.'

13:42.589 --> 13:46.226
So, uh...what's
with the new haircut?

13:46.293 --> 13:48.996
Is that
the Police Star special?

13:49.062 --> 13:51.098
I just cut it different.

13:51.164 --> 13:54.834
Bullshit.
You made them do it like that.

13:54.902 --> 13:56.269
What, are they
remaking "Taxi Driver"?

13:56.336 --> 13:58.105
Thought you might audition?

13:58.171 --> 14:00.740
You're jealous 'cause
you could never pull it off.

14:00.807 --> 14:02.943
Trust me, that's not it.

14:09.682 --> 14:11.318
- You good?
- No.

14:11.384 --> 14:15.088
But I'm dressed
if that's what you mean.

14:15.155 --> 14:18.091
Unbelievable what
women put up with.

14:18.158 --> 14:21.561
God was definitely a man.

14:21.628 --> 14:22.996
Patrol find any wits?

14:23.063 --> 14:25.232
Nope. We do have
two cameras. One's an ATM.

14:25.298 --> 14:27.667
And the camera from the bank
across the street?

14:27.734 --> 14:30.337
And the other
is a security camera

14:30.403 --> 14:32.772
from the building next door,
got a better angle.

14:32.839 --> 14:34.407
Phone calls
out to both of them.

14:34.474 --> 14:36.243
Just covering
all our bases here, Lydia.

14:36.309 --> 14:38.011
- Damn.
- I'm sorry.

14:38.078 --> 14:41.181
Christopher wailed all night.

14:41.248 --> 14:43.016
I finally know
why babies are shaken.

14:43.083 --> 14:46.753
Why don't you let me see a
picture of your little devil?

14:46.819 --> 14:49.156
You saw the picture on my desk.

14:49.222 --> 14:51.992
You don't have a picture
of your baby on your phone?

14:52.059 --> 14:54.061
No, I don't.

14:55.762 --> 14:57.230
Call DCFS.

14:57.998 --> 14:59.332
[phone ringing]

15:02.402 --> 15:04.371
Our rape victim just woke up.

15:04.437 --> 15:07.574
- A36. We are code 6.
- Manager called it in already.

15:09.176 --> 15:11.211
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Police.

15:11.278 --> 15:12.712
- 'Police!'
- 'Police!'

15:12.779 --> 15:15.515
- Police! Get down! Get down!
- I'll kill you!

15:15.582 --> 15:18.885
Hey! Hey! Get off him!

15:18.952 --> 15:21.354
Hey!
Get off him now!

15:21.421 --> 15:22.689
Now!

15:22.755 --> 15:23.890
Stay down!

15:23.957 --> 15:25.625
Stay down! Stay down!

15:25.692 --> 15:28.361
A36. Need an RA Unit
at our location.

15:30.530 --> 15:31.999
Stay down!

15:34.901 --> 15:37.170
- What are you doing?
- Applying pressure till the--

15:37.237 --> 15:40.107
It's a gay bathhouse, man.
You wanna get AIDS?

15:40.173 --> 15:42.542
Leaving Nate to Tammi?
Let the EMTs handle it.

15:42.609 --> 15:44.978
Here, apply pressure.

15:45.045 --> 15:47.747
It'll stop the bleeding.
You'll be fine, man.

15:47.814 --> 15:49.749
Use your head.

15:49.816 --> 15:52.485
'We're in here.'

15:52.552 --> 15:54.021
In here.

15:55.688 --> 15:59.759
Wanna talk about what happened
back there with those kids?

15:59.826 --> 16:02.362
You going off on them.

16:02.429 --> 16:05.465
Blood, guts,
all fun and games

16:05.532 --> 16:07.400
until you've been
in it for real.

16:07.467 --> 16:10.870
What, you gonna give them
a beat down in uniform as a cop?

16:10.937 --> 16:14.741
I was just making a point. Same
as you with the kid on the bike.

16:14.807 --> 16:18.011
No, the difference was I was
in control and you weren't.

16:18.078 --> 16:20.613
Maybe I'm just a better actor.

16:25.185 --> 16:28.521
Getting hot, huh?

16:28.588 --> 16:32.525
I bet you're glad
you're in your short sleeves.

16:32.592 --> 16:34.361
'Even though,
as I'm sure you know'

16:34.427 --> 16:38.265
it's the TO
that makes that call.

16:38.331 --> 16:41.634
Lets the Boot go short sleeves
when the Boot's making progress.

16:43.470 --> 16:46.039
- Didn't see that in the manual.
- Not in the manual.

16:46.106 --> 16:48.341
It's tradition.

16:48.408 --> 16:50.277
Well, I feel
no connection to it.

16:50.343 --> 16:52.912
But now that you mention it,
yeah, it is hot today.

16:52.979 --> 16:56.749
You know, why the hell
did you sign up for this?

16:56.816 --> 16:58.385
Huh? With that attitude?

16:58.451 --> 17:00.253
What, do you think
you played varsity

17:00.320 --> 17:02.555
running around Kandahar
clearing IEDs

17:02.622 --> 17:04.857
or whatever
the hell it was you did?

17:04.924 --> 17:07.660
Why are you here?

17:07.727 --> 17:10.930
I'm here because
the lumberyard near my house

17:10.997 --> 17:12.532
offered me
11 bucks an hour.

17:12.599 --> 17:17.170
The LAPD offered me
$50,342 a year with benefits.

17:17.237 --> 17:19.005
A true no-brainer.

17:19.072 --> 17:21.208
I'm sorry
if that pisses you off.

17:27.214 --> 17:29.382
Finish up.

17:29.449 --> 17:32.185
'We're done for now.'

17:35.088 --> 17:36.523
Let's go.

17:36.589 --> 17:37.957
- You didn't think anything.
- Chill.

17:38.024 --> 17:39.792
Hey, Armando.

17:39.859 --> 17:42.162
Excuse me.
I'm Detective Adams.

17:42.229 --> 17:43.830
This is my partner,
Detective Robinson.

17:43.896 --> 17:46.566
Did you guys get the pendejo
who robbed him?

17:48.335 --> 17:50.237
Well, we're doing our best.

17:50.303 --> 17:53.873
Yeah. Why don't you tell me
what happened, man?

17:53.940 --> 17:55.275
Pardon us.

17:55.342 --> 17:58.945
Uh, I went to this club,
you know, and I got wasted.

17:59.011 --> 18:02.249
They told me, "Don't walk home
alone," but, nah, I was stupid.

18:02.315 --> 18:03.783
I didn't listen.

18:03.850 --> 18:06.586
'Next thing I know, somebody
jumped me from the back'

18:06.653 --> 18:08.821
and he took my cellphone
and my wallet.

18:08.888 --> 18:10.490
I fought back, but..

18:10.557 --> 18:13.726
You were shit-faced, ese.
If not, that guy would be dead.

18:13.793 --> 18:15.562
Did you get a look at the guy?

18:15.628 --> 18:20.467
No. That's all I remember.
And then I woke up here.

18:20.533 --> 18:23.503
What do say we talk
for a minute alone, huh?

18:23.570 --> 18:25.238
- What? Why?
- You asking me why?

18:25.305 --> 18:28.375
Um, our, uh,
idiot supervisor

18:28.441 --> 18:30.443
he makes us do these statements
one-on-one.

18:30.510 --> 18:33.713
I know it's stupid, but we
can get in a lot of trouble.

18:33.780 --> 18:35.482
(Armando)
'Yeah, no,
it's cool, Pia.'

18:35.548 --> 18:37.750
Just, uh, go get me
some chips or something.

18:37.817 --> 18:40.587
Hey, but not barbecue.
Those taste like ass.

18:42.722 --> 18:44.857
Alright. Excuse us.

18:49.462 --> 18:52.632
(Lydia)
'Armando, the 911 caller'

18:52.699 --> 18:55.635
that saw you
being assaulted last night..

18:55.702 --> 18:58.638
..she said
you were being raped.

18:58.705 --> 19:00.407
What?

19:00.473 --> 19:03.476
The paramedics said
that when they found you

19:03.543 --> 19:06.946
your pants were off,
and you were..

19:07.013 --> 19:09.249
...you were bleeding
from the anus.

19:09.316 --> 19:12.352
We're gonna need to get
your consent to do a rape kit

19:12.419 --> 19:15.021
so that we can get DNA
to match any potential--

19:15.087 --> 19:17.224
No, no. I must have fell
or something.

19:17.290 --> 19:20.360
Like, jumping over a fence.

19:20.427 --> 19:24.464
Listen, you'll wanna get tested
for HIV, for Hep-C--

19:24.531 --> 19:26.499
(Armando)
'Did you not hear
what I said?'

19:26.566 --> 19:28.535
Yes, I heard you.
Are you hearing us?

19:28.601 --> 19:32.605
Do me a favor, don't go telling
Pia or my friends any of this.

19:32.672 --> 19:34.641
I've got my rights.
I'll sue you.

19:34.707 --> 19:35.875
[phone ringing]

19:35.942 --> 19:38.845
- Man, you're, like, calling me.
- Ah, let me have it.

19:40.747 --> 19:44.984
Hello? Uh, no.
I'm his girlfriend.

19:45.051 --> 19:49.422
Yeah, you found the phone.
It's our friend's phone.

19:49.489 --> 19:53.025
He was, he lost it.
It was stolen and--

19:53.092 --> 19:56.296
Reward? Yeah.

19:56.363 --> 19:59.499
Say like 100 bucks.

20:01.501 --> 20:04.571
Cool, we'll meet you there.

20:04.637 --> 20:05.772
Thanks.

20:13.946 --> 20:18.351
Christ. You make it to that age,
then get knifed in the shower.

20:18.418 --> 20:20.219
I hate these calls.

20:20.287 --> 20:22.489
It's better than dead kids.

20:22.555 --> 20:24.857
- Those haunt me.
- Hmm.

20:26.526 --> 20:29.362
So, tonight, we rented out
Cheetah's 8 to 10.

20:29.429 --> 20:31.664
A private show,
no civilians

20:31.731 --> 20:34.934
It's just to get things started,
then we'll see where we wind up.

20:35.001 --> 20:38.004
She was in the backyard reading
with her hearing aid off.

20:38.070 --> 20:39.539
Didn't even know
it was happening.

20:39.606 --> 20:41.441
What do you think?
Flocking Crew?

20:41.508 --> 20:43.042
'Maybe BMKs?'

20:43.109 --> 20:46.446
TV's gone, all their jewelry.
I bet someone knocked.

20:46.513 --> 20:50.182
No one answered.
They thought no one was home.

20:50.249 --> 20:52.051
(Bryant)
'They are sisters.'

20:52.118 --> 20:54.821
'Never married.
Lived together 60 years.'

20:57.089 --> 20:58.425
Ms. Coker.

20:58.491 --> 21:00.460
These are the detectives
I told you about.

21:00.527 --> 21:02.495
Okay, I'll check up
on you later, okay?

21:02.562 --> 21:03.963
- Okay.
- Okay.

21:04.030 --> 21:05.164
[phone ringing]

21:05.231 --> 21:06.633
Hey, sis.

21:07.900 --> 21:11.838
Oh. I was just
doing my job.

21:11.904 --> 21:15.241
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
It's pretty exciting.

21:15.308 --> 21:17.977
Yeah, yeah,
it's crazy, right?

21:18.044 --> 21:20.747
Yeah.
I bet he liked it.

21:20.813 --> 21:23.616
'Yeah, you know, tonight's
not good for me, but, um..'

21:25.752 --> 21:28.254
You couldn't have just said,
Starbucks, huh?

21:28.321 --> 21:30.690
How about you get it next time?

21:36.195 --> 21:37.597
No red jacket.

21:37.664 --> 21:41.368
Hey, you the guy
who brought the phone?

21:41.434 --> 21:43.102
Shit.

21:43.169 --> 21:44.804
Hey, hey, hey!

21:46.773 --> 21:48.508
'Come on, man.'

21:50.977 --> 21:53.580
Hey, don't make me.
Don't make me.

22:04.391 --> 22:06.092
Come on, man!

22:13.900 --> 22:15.101
Hey.

22:15.768 --> 22:16.903
Stop!

22:24.644 --> 22:27.480
Yeah.
Next time I pick the place.

22:28.515 --> 22:30.417
Hey, I got to take a piss.

22:30.483 --> 22:32.452
You'll wait till
I'm done here.

22:32.519 --> 22:34.954
No, man, bad.
I can't hold it.

22:35.021 --> 22:38.124
- Alright, go ahead.
- In my pants?

22:38.190 --> 22:41.961
You gotta go, you gotta go.
Next time, wear a diaper.

22:43.195 --> 22:45.465
You alright?

22:45.532 --> 22:48.034
Eh, just that old lady.

22:48.100 --> 22:50.136
You know, can't quite shake it.

22:50.202 --> 22:51.471
I know, man. It sucks.

22:51.538 --> 22:53.573
You answer the door,
they might kill you.

22:53.640 --> 22:58.711
You don't answer, the same.
No escape. It's awful.

22:58.778 --> 23:02.449
You're so sympathetic,
you take a call near the victim.

23:03.182 --> 23:04.917
It was my sister.

23:04.984 --> 23:07.353
About the medal.
She was calling to say congrats.

23:07.420 --> 23:09.456
All of us could hear it.

23:09.522 --> 23:13.159
'The old lady
was practically deaf.'

23:13.225 --> 23:15.428
It's just not very professional.

23:22.034 --> 23:24.771
Gotta get a pen.

23:24.837 --> 23:26.873
- 'Man, I'm gonna piss myself.'
- 'Shut up.'

23:26.939 --> 23:29.275
- Whip it out for me.
- 'Shut up!'

23:29.341 --> 23:31.478
Please, man.

23:31.544 --> 23:33.713
You know what?
Stand up.

23:35.515 --> 23:39.519
You know I got your I.D.
and your keys.

23:39.586 --> 23:41.788
You're not gonna run,
are you?

23:54.333 --> 23:58.104
Over here! 911!
Over here! Someone's shooting!

23:58.170 --> 24:01.040
They were shooting!
There were two shots! Two shots!

24:01.107 --> 24:03.275
- See anybody run out?
- 'No, no!'

24:03.342 --> 24:05.912
Alright, get back!

24:05.978 --> 24:08.481
(female #2)
'Where are you going?'

24:08.548 --> 24:11.117
'Hey! Help!'

24:11.183 --> 24:13.119
'Oh, my God!'

24:13.185 --> 24:14.754
'There were two shots.'

24:16.322 --> 24:19.158
They're still in there.

24:19.225 --> 24:20.660
'Oh, my God.'

24:20.727 --> 24:23.029
Drop it.
Drop the gun!

24:23.095 --> 24:25.732
Hands on your head.
Hands on your head!

24:25.798 --> 24:29.068
I killed him! Oh, Jesus!
I didn't mean to kill him!

24:30.903 --> 24:32.038
Worked.

24:35.307 --> 24:37.243
Barry!

24:37.309 --> 24:39.746
'Barry! Oh, my God.
Are you okay, man?'

24:39.812 --> 24:42.682
I'm so sorry, Barry!

24:42.749 --> 24:44.517
What the hell
are you two thinking?

24:44.584 --> 24:46.853
- Lady pawned it yesterday.
- 'Get up.'

24:46.919 --> 24:49.589
I don't sell no crap,
nothing I won't stand behind.

24:49.656 --> 24:51.824
That's was very conscientious
of you.

24:51.891 --> 24:53.860
He had me shoot him
to test it.

24:53.926 --> 24:57.129
Lucky, didn't ask you to stick
it up your ass and shoot.

24:57.196 --> 24:59.498
Why would I do that?

24:59.566 --> 25:01.568
What happened here?

25:03.836 --> 25:07.206
I missed the first time.

25:07.273 --> 25:09.408
No, give me that back.

25:09.475 --> 25:10.943
Thank you.

25:14.647 --> 25:16.816
Permission to toy
with these people, sir.

25:16.883 --> 25:19.752
Or do you want them
all to yourself?

25:22.254 --> 25:24.090
You take them.

25:29.629 --> 25:31.798
(Sherman)
'There's a law against
that, you know.'

25:31.864 --> 25:35.001
Let me know
if you see any coppers.

25:35.067 --> 25:36.736
What?

25:36.803 --> 25:38.871
You know what?
Screw her.

25:38.938 --> 25:41.273
She wants to take Nate
to San Diego

25:41.340 --> 25:43.976
over Presidents' Day,
which is my weekend.

25:44.043 --> 25:48.014
I do backflips to stick
to the court-approved schedule.

25:48.080 --> 25:50.817
She can, too.
N-O. Send.

25:50.883 --> 25:52.985
Sammy, baby carriage.

25:55.521 --> 25:57.189
What the fuck!

25:57.256 --> 25:59.025
- Testing, man.
- What's the matter with you?

25:59.091 --> 26:01.260
I'm just testing you.
Put the phone down.

26:01.327 --> 26:04.163
Just testing?

26:04.230 --> 26:06.999
Know what? I don't exactly like
listening to this shit 24/7.

26:07.066 --> 26:09.268
- You know what--
- Put the fuckin' phone down.

26:09.335 --> 26:12.104
Have kids someday.
You'll understand.

26:12.171 --> 26:14.340
How do you know
he's really yours?

26:16.408 --> 26:17.644
We did a paternity test.

26:17.710 --> 26:20.112
Hmm, and who told you
the results?

26:21.113 --> 26:23.616
- The lab.
- Uh-huh, on the phone.

26:23.683 --> 26:25.451
You don't think
Tammi could have had

26:25.517 --> 26:28.120
one of her burn-out pals
make that call?

26:28.187 --> 26:31.457
I mean, Victor's not paying
for San Diego. You are.

26:31.523 --> 26:34.593
He wants to take pictures of
parking meters and call it art.

26:34.661 --> 26:38.297
Meanwhile, you're forking over
child support and alimony.

26:38.364 --> 26:41.333
I mean, Tammi's no genius,
but she's smart enough for that.

26:41.400 --> 26:43.670
Of course, he's my kid!

26:43.736 --> 26:47.173
He's got my fuckin' feet,
my personality.

26:48.440 --> 26:50.376
You're being a dick.

26:53.746 --> 26:55.715
(man on radio)
'Hit and run, westbound..'

26:57.016 --> 27:00.319
The Taliban uses POW's
to test out body armor.

27:01.620 --> 27:03.690
Different worlds, man.

27:06.025 --> 27:08.728
You talk a lot about the war.

27:08.795 --> 27:11.563
Well, I did two tours.
It's kind of hard not to.

27:11.630 --> 27:13.232
Did you ever serve?

27:13.299 --> 27:15.501
All through high school.

27:15.567 --> 27:17.804
Baskin-Robbins down on Crenshaw.

27:19.271 --> 27:20.773
I bet you were an asset.

27:20.840 --> 27:23.609
Oh, I dug a mean Rocky Road.

27:23.676 --> 27:25.077
What about college?

27:25.144 --> 27:27.714
No, I dodged that bullet, too.

27:27.780 --> 27:30.582
I learned all I need to know
right out here.

27:30.649 --> 27:32.785
You got any advice?

27:33.986 --> 27:35.554
You really asking?

27:35.621 --> 27:37.423
Yes, sir.

27:39.625 --> 27:42.028
Treat it like a circus.

27:42.094 --> 27:43.462
It?

27:43.529 --> 27:45.164
All of it.

27:45.231 --> 27:50.069
It starts to get to you,
just remember...circus.

27:52.471 --> 27:53.840
That's been working out for you?

27:53.906 --> 27:55.641
Well, I haven't gone postal yet.

27:55.708 --> 27:57.043
Yeah.

27:58.177 --> 28:00.312
(Adams)
You're not gonna talk?

28:10.656 --> 28:13.793
It's him.
I can feel it.

28:13.860 --> 28:17.730
No alibi.
Won't look at me.

28:17.797 --> 28:19.832
Hey, I'm right there
with you, partner.

28:19.899 --> 28:22.134
But he's too smart to roll.

28:22.201 --> 28:25.637
At least until we have more.

28:25.704 --> 28:28.007
'I'm not sure this will help.'

28:32.478 --> 28:34.313
(Adams)
'Please tell me he looks up.'

28:34.380 --> 28:37.449
(Robinson)
'Not for the entire 6 minutes.'

28:39.685 --> 28:42.054
We need Armando's rape kit.

28:44.156 --> 28:45.892
We think he's done this
to at least two other people.

28:45.958 --> 28:48.727
Okay, if you don't help us,
he's gonna walk.

28:48.795 --> 28:53.199
(Armando)
Yeah, that's not my problem.
And stop saying did this.

28:53.265 --> 28:55.868
All he did was steal my shit.

28:55.935 --> 28:58.204
Now, can you
please leave me alone.

29:16.088 --> 29:21.260
That button...right there...if
you wanna know the truth.

29:21.327 --> 29:23.262
I know I would.

30:00.432 --> 30:01.901
That isn't me.

30:03.169 --> 30:05.872
'Now, get the fuck
out of my room.'

30:06.939 --> 30:09.108
They're gonna say
I must have wanted it

30:09.175 --> 30:11.477
or I would have fought back.

30:11.543 --> 30:14.013
'I could have been a man.'

30:14.080 --> 30:16.548
A man gets justice.

30:16.615 --> 30:20.219
'Let them give you this rape kit
so we can put this guy away.'

30:20.286 --> 30:21.653
Rape kit?
What the fuck.

30:21.720 --> 30:23.755
My boyfriend didn't rape nobody.

30:23.822 --> 30:27.359
Come on chill, Pia.
Shit.

30:27.426 --> 30:29.896
'Some girl got raped
last night right around'

30:29.962 --> 30:32.298
where I got rolled and..

30:32.364 --> 30:36.068
...cop here was just asking
if I saw anything, you know?

30:36.135 --> 30:37.603
He told you
he was wasted.

30:37.669 --> 30:40.639
Why don't you get the guy,
not harass him about rape?

30:40.706 --> 30:42.208
We're on it.

30:45.811 --> 30:48.214
Mendoza, text you
about tonight?

30:48.280 --> 30:51.317
Nope. Must have missed the cut.

30:51.383 --> 30:55.154
He probably just forgot.
It's, uh, Cheetah's, 8 o'clock.

30:55.221 --> 30:56.222
Yeah.

30:56.288 --> 30:58.490
Just for kicks,
then we'll move from there.

30:58.557 --> 31:01.560
I got Nate tonight, man.
Not sure I can make it.

31:01.627 --> 31:03.429
Oh, come on.

31:03.495 --> 31:05.331
'What is this?'

31:05.397 --> 31:09.301
That's Flaco and Cuete,
but who's that other dude?

31:09.368 --> 31:12.738
(Sherman)
'I don't have a clue.'

31:12.804 --> 31:14.140
[gunshots]

31:16.508 --> 31:18.444
Hey! Hey!

31:20.079 --> 31:22.081
Shots fired.
Suspect down.

31:22.148 --> 31:24.283
Corner of 1st and Douglas.

31:29.989 --> 31:32.124
- 'Alright, I got him.'
- 'Go.'

31:33.592 --> 31:35.261
Go, go, go!

31:38.697 --> 31:41.333
'I got two suspects heading
North on foot.'

31:41.400 --> 31:43.502
'The alley behind Douglas.'

31:46.038 --> 31:48.574
(Sherman)
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Freeze!
Stop! Put it down!

31:48.640 --> 31:50.742
- 'I swear I'm a..'
- On your knees!

31:50.809 --> 31:52.378
- I'm a cop!
- On your knees!

31:52.444 --> 31:54.213
- I'm a cop!
- Hands behind your head!

31:54.280 --> 31:56.048
- I swear it.
- Hands behind your head!

31:56.115 --> 32:00.552
I'm a...I'm a cop.
I'm a cop, man. I'm a cop.

32:00.619 --> 32:04.056
(woman on radio)
'A57. Officers
requesting backup.'

32:04.123 --> 32:06.892
'Possible disturbance on
the 5000 block of East Romaine.'

32:06.959 --> 32:08.527
That's where those kids
got shot.

32:08.594 --> 32:10.096
Reply to call.

32:10.162 --> 32:11.730
A57. Show us en route.

32:11.797 --> 32:13.199
Kid that got killed last night

32:13.265 --> 32:15.601
lived a couple of blocks
over on Edgemont.

32:15.667 --> 32:19.338
I read the bulletins.
It's a habit.

32:19.405 --> 32:21.140
Here we go.

32:21.207 --> 32:23.875
[woman speaking
in foreign language]

32:23.942 --> 32:25.811
Are you okay?
Whoa!

32:25.877 --> 32:27.013
'Whoa!'

32:27.079 --> 32:28.447
[crowd clamoring]

32:28.514 --> 32:30.749
A57. Show us
taking rocks and bottles.

32:30.816 --> 32:32.951
Come on, this side!

32:33.552 --> 32:36.155
[siren blaring]

32:40.259 --> 32:42.561
Okay, stay close.

32:42.628 --> 32:44.396
Dewey!
What's going on?

32:44.463 --> 32:47.166
- Come on! Come on, come on!
- Who's in charge?

32:47.233 --> 32:49.001
Get those kids
out of here, now.

32:49.068 --> 32:51.070
Back up people,
back up.

32:51.137 --> 32:52.538
Back up! Back up!

32:52.604 --> 32:55.141
Get them out!
Get them out!

33:00.112 --> 33:02.481
[indistinct chatter]

33:02.548 --> 33:05.051
They're crazy over there!
Man, go.

33:07.886 --> 33:09.721
Come on!

33:13.425 --> 33:17.029
Come on, Ruben. Don't go soft
on me. I got a baby at home.

33:17.096 --> 33:20.132
I don't need
another one at work.

33:20.199 --> 33:22.368
Alright, listen.
Make it fast.

33:22.434 --> 33:23.502
Okay.

33:23.569 --> 33:25.437
I can't ask background
question forever.

33:25.504 --> 33:27.273
Alright.

33:32.211 --> 33:34.180
No, you get out.

33:34.246 --> 33:36.315
I already had this talk
with your partner.

33:36.382 --> 33:37.916
I know. He told me.

33:37.983 --> 33:39.751
Well, I don't care
what he told you.

33:39.818 --> 33:44.623
That 911 call was a prank.
The bitch was just high.

33:44.690 --> 33:46.392
I got robbed.

33:46.458 --> 33:48.660
Now can you please get out?

33:49.461 --> 33:50.596
[sighs]

33:52.364 --> 33:53.632
'What?'

33:56.102 --> 33:58.770
There's been a terrible mistake.

33:58.837 --> 34:01.440
Your family, friends, Pia..

34:03.041 --> 34:05.677
...they know about the video.

34:05.744 --> 34:06.878
It was an accident.

34:06.945 --> 34:09.315
We were showing the video
to our lieutenant.

34:09.381 --> 34:11.183
We didn't know
your family was around

34:11.250 --> 34:13.952
and your dad got
a glimpse of it.

34:14.019 --> 34:16.054
He engaged us about it and..

34:16.122 --> 34:19.191
We had no choice,
but to show it to him.

34:21.560 --> 34:22.861
We're so sorry.

34:22.928 --> 34:24.463
Oh, you're "so sorry".

34:24.530 --> 34:27.065
Your mother and father,
they-they wanna see you.

34:27.133 --> 34:29.735
They're fine, but..

34:29.801 --> 34:33.605
...your fiends and Pia,
I'd give them a bit more time.

34:35.241 --> 34:38.944
So the secret's out now.

34:39.010 --> 34:42.348
Let us get who did this to you.

34:42.414 --> 34:45.817
Do the rape kit
and get your blood tested.

34:45.884 --> 34:47.819
God, I wish I were dead.

34:47.886 --> 34:49.821
You don't wish that.

35:20.386 --> 35:22.154
Don't make
a production out of it.

35:22.221 --> 35:23.389
Just...clean it up, okay?

35:23.455 --> 35:25.224
What are you,
what are you doing?

35:25.291 --> 35:27.259
Just put that down.
Go to the car.

35:27.326 --> 35:29.495
Stop touching shit.
What...just let me have that.

35:29.561 --> 35:31.129
'Let me have that, thanks.'

35:31.197 --> 35:32.464
You gonna live?

35:32.531 --> 35:34.600
Me? Yeah, man.
I've never been better.

35:34.666 --> 35:36.835
I just wish I'd shot
more of these bastards.

35:36.902 --> 35:39.671
Twenty years ago half of them
would be in the morgue

35:39.738 --> 35:42.741
and you and me would be
at the bar drinking, right?

35:44.276 --> 35:46.745
What was that?
Your Boot just give me attitude?

35:46.812 --> 35:48.547
You still wanna trade.

35:48.614 --> 35:51.917
Jesus, man.
Freaking Boots.

35:51.983 --> 35:55.287
Hey, uh, who was
the incident commander?

35:55.354 --> 35:57.223
Sergeant Crespo allegedly.

35:57.289 --> 35:58.924
He was working
the phones at first

35:58.990 --> 36:02.361
until he shrunk into his car
and lost his water.

36:02.428 --> 36:05.397
(female #3)
'They just started shooting
at us and innocent kids!'

36:05.464 --> 36:07.733
Oh, yeah, real innocent.

36:07.799 --> 36:09.301
These fuckers, man.

36:09.368 --> 36:12.538
Screamin' and yellin'.
Grabbin', punchin'.

36:12.604 --> 36:14.773
One of them came after me
with a hammer.

36:14.840 --> 36:17.409
Then I got hit in the head
with a bottle.

36:17.476 --> 36:20.712
Am I gonna lose an eye
over this, Johnny?

36:20.779 --> 36:23.349
Pinche puto, mother fuckers
are lucky that I was shooting

36:23.415 --> 36:25.183
rubber bullets,
I'll tell you that.

36:25.251 --> 36:28.454
A buddy says they got more
craziness over on Silver Lake.

36:28.520 --> 36:30.522
Welcome to the info age.

36:30.589 --> 36:32.291
Instant riots,
just add tweets.

36:32.358 --> 36:34.960
Can I get some, uh..
Some help here?

36:35.026 --> 36:36.828
You get sewn up, bro.

36:36.895 --> 36:38.530
Alright, man.

36:42.067 --> 36:45.804
Few idiots lose their minds
and now we all gotta pay for it.

36:45.871 --> 36:47.239
We came in at the end.

36:47.306 --> 36:49.007
What, are you gonna
Monday-morning quarterback it?

36:49.074 --> 36:52.210
- Isn't it obvious?
- What's your point, Steele?

36:52.278 --> 36:53.645
Just that it's pointless.

36:53.712 --> 36:56.582
Us, them,
the whole goddamn thing.

37:00.419 --> 37:01.953
What is this?

37:04.155 --> 37:07.359
(captain)
Take a deep breath, officers,
we've got to tell you something

37:07.426 --> 37:10.095
that will require
your understanding.

37:10.161 --> 37:12.030
Thank you, captain.

37:12.097 --> 37:14.333
Gentlemen, what you rolled into

37:14.400 --> 37:17.068
was supposed to be
an integrity check.

37:17.135 --> 37:20.439
Half the gangsters were UC's
posing as drug dealers.

37:20.506 --> 37:22.474
'Rocks of crack were planted
in the gutters.'

37:22.541 --> 37:25.544
We wanted to see if any
of the cops that rousted them

37:25.611 --> 37:27.779
would try to pin the dope
on them anyway.

37:27.846 --> 37:31.750
Regrettably, when you showed up,
so did some real assholes.

37:31.817 --> 37:35.854
Asked our guys where they were
from, all hell broke loose.

37:35.921 --> 37:37.289
So on behalf of IA

37:37.356 --> 37:40.659
I've come down here
personally to apologize.

37:42.227 --> 37:45.364
That's it?
You knew about this?

37:45.431 --> 37:48.233
No, it was all IA.

37:48.300 --> 37:51.370
You pull this kind of nonsense
in a gang-infested area?

37:51.437 --> 37:53.171
- How felony stupid, huh?
- Sammy.

37:53.238 --> 37:56.742
What about your integrity, huh,
sir? Who's checking you?

37:56.808 --> 37:58.777
(captain)
'Come on, Bryant.
He's trying to apologize.'

37:58.844 --> 38:02.414
I see what he's trying to do.
He's trying to toss empty sorry.

38:02.481 --> 38:04.483
So he can sweep it
under the rug.

38:04.550 --> 38:06.518
I risk my life
out here every day.

38:06.585 --> 38:09.355
You're gonna have me shot
or make my kid an orphan

38:09.421 --> 38:13.258
on the 1% chance that
you might find a dirty cop?

38:13.325 --> 38:15.561
- Is that it?
- 'Sammy.'

38:15.627 --> 38:18.430
Go fuck yourself.

38:18.497 --> 38:22.000
Integrity check.
Holy shit.

38:35.814 --> 38:37.849
You lied to me.

38:40.352 --> 38:42.954
'Pia came in here.
She got me this.'

38:43.021 --> 38:44.590
'She acted totally cool.'

38:44.656 --> 38:46.892
I could tell she didn't know.

38:46.958 --> 38:49.428
You lied.
What kind of person are you?

38:49.495 --> 38:51.863
It's good news, right?

38:51.930 --> 38:55.166
And since you're 18, you can
keep it from them forever.

38:55.233 --> 38:56.768
Your choice.

38:58.570 --> 39:01.339
Any word on...those tests?

39:01.407 --> 39:04.476
'The doctors will let you know
if the blood shows something.'

39:04.543 --> 39:08.013
No, I mean...the other.

39:08.079 --> 39:11.750
Uh-uh, not yet.
We'll keep you posted.

39:13.485 --> 39:14.953
Take care.

39:16.422 --> 39:17.756
Detective.

39:19.958 --> 39:21.893
You're a real bitch.

39:25.464 --> 39:27.999
[instrumental music]

39:38.577 --> 39:40.712
Yeah.
Ha ha ha.

39:55.694 --> 39:58.430
[music continues]

40:25.323 --> 40:27.859
[music continues]

40:29.761 --> 40:31.563
- Hey.
- Hey.

40:31.630 --> 40:34.199
So uh...Mendoza's going nuts.

40:34.265 --> 40:36.835
He's buying everybody
lap dances. You want one?

40:36.902 --> 40:39.404
- No, I've had my fill.
- Yeah.

40:39.471 --> 40:42.708
I gotta get home to Nate.

40:42.774 --> 40:44.142
Alright.

40:45.944 --> 40:47.846
Crazy day, huh?

40:50.148 --> 40:53.118
Uh, listen...um..

40:53.184 --> 40:56.755
...congrats on the medal. I've
been meaning to tell you that.

40:57.489 --> 40:58.957
Thanks, man.

40:59.925 --> 41:01.326
Appreciate it.

41:01.392 --> 41:03.629
Say hey to the kid for me.

41:24.082 --> 41:26.618
[baby crying]

41:53.411 --> 41:55.947
[continues crying]

42:13.464 --> 42:16.101
(Bryant)
'I thought your nephew
flew in from Phoenix.'

42:17.636 --> 42:20.906
'Called the detectives, they
said that they reached him.'

42:22.473 --> 42:25.844
- Daniel?
- Yeah, Daniel.

42:25.911 --> 42:27.613
Oh.

42:27.679 --> 42:29.815
His plane got kept back.

42:32.183 --> 42:34.119
When will he get here?

42:35.921 --> 42:38.189
When will Daniel come?

42:38.590 --> 42:40.325
Oh.

42:40.391 --> 42:44.329
He said...late, I think.

42:47.766 --> 42:49.500
I'm gonna stay.

42:49.567 --> 42:51.136
'Ms. Coker,
is that okay with you?'

42:51.202 --> 42:53.772
'I'm gonna stay
till he gets here?'

42:55.040 --> 42:57.809
Just got to
take care of my babysitter.

43:01.980 --> 43:05.583
- What are you doing?
- I have to go to the bathroom.

43:05.651 --> 43:09.120
No.
Not there...here.

43:11.790 --> 43:14.225
'Ms. Coker, did nobody clean
the bathroom?'

43:17.362 --> 43:19.731
Didn't the detectives tell you
you could pay someone

43:19.798 --> 43:22.267
that there's people
that will do that for you?

43:25.804 --> 43:27.773
[instrumental music]

43:27.839 --> 43:30.275
(Mendoza)
Hey! Sherman.

43:30.341 --> 43:32.911
Poster boy, come on, man.
This is your night, yeah.

43:32.978 --> 43:35.380
Oh, no, no, no.
I'm done, man.

43:35.446 --> 43:36.614
I'm done.
Hey, hey, hey.

43:36.682 --> 43:38.149
(Mendoza)
'Your night.'

43:39.417 --> 43:40.719
(female #1)
Party! Yeah!

43:40.786 --> 43:42.821
Alright. Enjoy it, Sherman.

43:42.888 --> 43:45.623
[indistinct chatter]

43:50.996 --> 43:52.330
[helicopter whirring]

43:54.632 --> 43:56.201
[all screaming]

43:56.267 --> 43:59.070
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa! Get off the car.

43:59.137 --> 44:02.774
Get off the car.
Hey. Put the gun down.

44:02.841 --> 44:04.375
Get down.

44:04.442 --> 44:05.777
[all screaming]

44:09.380 --> 44:11.683
Get down.

44:11.750 --> 44:14.385
Get off the car
and put down the gun!

44:14.452 --> 44:15.787
[gunshot]

44:20.091 --> 44:22.060
- Just get out of here. Go, go.
- What?

44:22.127 --> 44:24.295
I take my days like
the rest of you.

44:24.362 --> 44:28.499
Don't be stupid. Get out of
here. I'll take care of it. Go!

44:28.566 --> 44:29.901
[siren blaring]

44:41.246 --> 44:42.380
Yo!

44:45.784 --> 44:47.118
[keys jingling]

45:39.704 --> 45:42.240
[instrumental music]

46:09.734 --> 46:12.270
[music continues]

46:21.012 --> 46:23.014
