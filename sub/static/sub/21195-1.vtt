00:28.029 --> 00:29.406
Illuminat...

00:30.782 --> 00:32.491
Illuminat...

00:33.618 --> 00:34.661
Illuminat...

00:39.999 --> 00:42.460
Illumination!

00:55.765 --> 00:57.225
The year was 1985,

00:57.392 --> 00:59.644
and the number one
show on TV was...

00:59.728 --> 01:02.105
Evil Bratt!

01:02.522 --> 01:06.443
<i>The show starred young
Balthazar Bratt as a child prodigy</i>

01:06.651 --> 01:10.989
<i>and criminal mastermind
bent on world domination.</i>

01:11.156 --> 01:12.490
<i>There he is! Get him!</i>

01:16.077 --> 01:19.080
<i>I've been a bad boy!</i>

01:19.247 --> 01:21.958
Bratt was the biggest
child actor of the 1980s,

01:22.292 --> 01:25.378
<i>striking a chord with
audiences all over the world.</i>

01:27.005 --> 01:29.215
<i>There he is! Get him!</i>

01:29.382 --> 01:32.719
<i>But it all came
to an end in Season 3, when...</i>

01:33.094 --> 01:35.680
<i>I've been a bad boy!</i>

01:35.847 --> 01:37.616
<i>The young star experienced
an unexpected growth spurt.</i>

01:37.640 --> 01:39.058
<i>Boy? Ugh!</i>

01:39.142 --> 01:42.395
The show was canceled.
Hollywood rejected him

01:42.562 --> 01:45.482
<i>and Bratt quickly plunged
into a downward spiral,</i>

01:45.648 --> 01:50.820
<i>starting to actually believe he was
the character he played on TV.</i>

01:50.987 --> 01:52.447
<i>What are you looking at?</i>

01:52.989 --> 01:54.824
<i>Leading us all to wonder,</i>

01:54.991 --> 01:56.951
<i>where is he now?</i>

02:03.458 --> 02:04.709
You know what, Clive?

02:04.959 --> 02:07.212
Playing a villain on TV was fun,

02:07.378 --> 02:10.840
but being one in real life
is even better.

02:11.007 --> 02:12.217
Heist music!

02:12.383 --> 02:13.510
Here it comes.

02:16.554 --> 02:19.057
What?
Clive, what are you doing?

02:19.140 --> 02:20.809
How is that heist music?

02:20.975 --> 02:22.393
Sorry. My bad.

02:56.261 --> 02:57.637
Ew!

03:02.183 --> 03:03.309
Mommy!

03:04.602 --> 03:05.937
Stop or I'll...

03:08.606 --> 03:12.026
Sir, the ship has been boarded
by some kind of monster!

03:12.110 --> 03:13.150
Wait! That's not
a monster.

03:14.028 --> 03:16.614
That's a man
wearing shoulder pads!

03:16.823 --> 03:18.324
There's only one supervillain

03:18.408 --> 03:20.660
whose fashion sense
is quite that dated.

03:20.827 --> 03:22.620
Balthazar Bratt.

03:22.787 --> 03:25.373
Blast it! The Dumont
Diamond is on that ship.

03:25.540 --> 03:29.544
<i>I want every agent in the area
on the scene immediately!</i>

03:34.966 --> 03:37.677
We're already here. Agents
Grucy are closing fast.

03:37.802 --> 03:40.471
Yes! Wait.
What did you call us?

03:40.555 --> 03:43.808
"Grucy." You know, GRU and
Lucy mushed together. Try it.

03:43.975 --> 03:46.769
Oh! I like it,
but not a lot.

03:46.853 --> 03:47.854
I don't like it.

03:53.443 --> 03:55.069
Stop!
On the ground!

04:18.216 --> 04:19.594
Go, go, go!

04:24.974 --> 04:26.351
Eh?

04:34.525 --> 04:37.028
Too late again, GRU!

04:44.535 --> 04:46.579
Wha?

04:46.746 --> 04:47.747
He's getting away!

04:47.956 --> 04:49.582
That's what he thinks.

04:55.713 --> 04:57.048
Go! Go! Go...

04:58.424 --> 05:00.718
Go! Go! Go!
Go! Go!

05:04.722 --> 05:06.265
I don't think we
can make it, GRU!

05:06.349 --> 05:07.392
We can make it!

05:09.644 --> 05:12.605
We can make it!

05:14.857 --> 05:16.401
No, we can't!

05:16.651 --> 05:17.652
Ahh!

05:17.902 --> 05:18.987
Get ready!

05:20.697 --> 05:22.490
Get ready for...

05:33.459 --> 05:35.503
Hey. How you doing?

05:38.006 --> 05:39.298
Are you okay?

05:40.925 --> 05:42.969
You guys are so cute.

05:43.219 --> 05:44.595
Go get him, GRU-GRU!

05:45.513 --> 05:46.723
Hello, GRU.

05:48.141 --> 05:49.600
How's your transition coming?

05:49.684 --> 05:51.477
You know, from world's
worst villain

05:51.561 --> 05:53.312
to world's worst agent?

05:53.396 --> 05:55.690
Oh, that's hilarious.
You should be on TV.

05:55.773 --> 05:59.360
Oh, that's right. You were!
But then you got canceled!

05:59.444 --> 06:01.237
Ha-ha!

06:01.988 --> 06:03.156
What about that?
Ugh!

06:03.531 --> 06:06.117
What? Oh, girls!
Oh!

06:08.995 --> 06:09.995
Dance fight!

06:23.176 --> 06:24.385
Ow!

06:28.473 --> 06:32.143
Alpha Team, the diamond is secure.
Come and pick up the package.

06:32.351 --> 06:34.520
<i>Copy that.
Alpha Team in approach.</i>

06:40.151 --> 06:41.152
GRU!

06:41.778 --> 06:43.571
Did you actually
think I was unconscious?

06:43.738 --> 06:46.115
Huh! It's called acting, hoser.

06:46.199 --> 06:48.534
And clearly, I've still got it!

07:03.633 --> 07:06.219
I've been a bad boy!

07:07.929 --> 07:09.281
Freeze! Don't move!

07:09.305 --> 07:10.515
Son of a Betamax!

07:10.681 --> 07:12.183
Go, go! Get him!

07:12.266 --> 07:13.893
He's getting away!

07:14.936 --> 07:16.312
This isn't over, GRU.

07:16.521 --> 07:19.357
You hear me?
This is not over.

07:19.565 --> 07:22.235
Yeah? Well,
I still have the diamond.

07:23.778 --> 07:25.279
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

07:25.446 --> 07:28.032
<i>Happy birthday to...</i>

07:28.866 --> 07:33.996
<i>Happy birthday, dear Dan</i>

07:34.163 --> 07:39.210
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

08:09.407 --> 08:12.285
I can't believe
Bratt got away again.

08:12.368 --> 08:14.328
How is this
possible? How?

08:22.253 --> 08:24.088
And it's not just
that he got away,

08:24.172 --> 08:25.882
it is he's so smug about it.

08:25.965 --> 08:29.177
"Ooh, I've been
a bad boy!"

08:29.427 --> 08:33.097
Gah! Edna, hey!
Looking hot today.

08:33.389 --> 08:35.140
Got cats on you.

08:35.308 --> 08:40.270
And it was so humiliating, dangling
there in the bubble-gum Speedo.

08:40.730 --> 08:43.191
And I didn't have time to
go to the gym this week,

08:43.274 --> 08:47.904
and I had a big breakfast. And
was feeling a little bloated.

08:50.323 --> 08:52.283
You know what? He's not
even worth talking about.

08:52.450 --> 08:56.454
I don't even want to waste
another breath about the guy.

08:56.787 --> 08:58.456
And another thing!

08:59.081 --> 09:03.377
Next time I see Bratt, I will
moonwalk all over his stupid face!

09:08.007 --> 09:11.219
Thank you all for coming
at such short notice.

09:11.928 --> 09:16.641
It is with great sadness that I
inform you that, as of today,

09:17.058 --> 09:20.436
I am retiring as
head of the AVL.

09:22.688 --> 09:23.731
Oh, no!

09:24.273 --> 09:29.195
Your new leader is coming
directly from head office.

09:29.362 --> 09:31.656
Effective immediately.

09:32.114 --> 09:34.909
She is the very gifted,

09:35.076 --> 09:39.080
very ambitious,
Miss Valerie da Vinci.

09:40.039 --> 09:43.209
As I look out
over all your faces,

09:43.376 --> 09:45.753
I am flooded with
so many memories.

09:45.920 --> 09:48.422
Oh, boy!
This is a snooze fest!

09:48.506 --> 09:49.524
Excuse me, this is my last...

09:49.548 --> 09:50.567
Blah, blah, blah!
We understand.

09:50.591 --> 09:52.802
You're old, you're
fat, you're done.

09:53.469 --> 09:54.762
Let me breathe in.

09:56.722 --> 09:58.975
Ooh, broke a little sweat,
there.

09:59.892 --> 10:02.061
First order of business,

10:02.186 --> 10:04.897
which one of you losers
is Agent GRU?

10:06.524 --> 10:08.442
Oh, that would be me.

10:08.609 --> 10:12.780
Although, I don't know if
I'd say "loser," per se.

10:12.947 --> 10:15.449
Kind of is...

10:16.659 --> 10:17.702
Oh, it's the girls!

10:18.327 --> 10:19.996
Not a good time.

10:20.204 --> 10:21.205
Hey!
Ahh!

10:21.580 --> 10:23.249
Yes, sir!
Uh...

10:23.749 --> 10:25.710
Ma'am? You're making me nervous.

10:26.043 --> 10:28.963
How could you let
Balthazar Bratt,

10:29.046 --> 10:31.215
the AVL's most wanted villain,

10:31.382 --> 10:32.550
just get away?

10:32.717 --> 10:34.885
That is the opposite
of what we do here!

10:35.094 --> 10:36.095
Okay, okay.

10:36.220 --> 10:39.098
Yes, maybe
he got away. Again.

10:39.265 --> 10:41.892
But he didn't get the diamond.

10:42.059 --> 10:44.937
And I am this close
to bringing him in.

10:45.104 --> 10:47.231
This close.

10:47.523 --> 10:49.066
Huh. Interesting.

10:49.233 --> 10:50.443
You're fired!

10:50.609 --> 10:51.861
What?

10:51.944 --> 10:54.572
That's totally not fair.
GRU is a great agent!

10:54.697 --> 10:55.990
You know what?
If you fire him,

10:56.073 --> 10:58.409
you're gonna have to
fire me, sister-sister.

10:58.617 --> 11:00.453
And do you really wanna do that?

11:00.578 --> 11:02.079
Do ya?

11:02.413 --> 11:04.206
No, no, no!

11:10.463 --> 11:11.839
Well, I guess she did.

11:17.636 --> 11:19.513
Honey, you didn't
have to do that.

11:19.597 --> 11:21.265
I know how much
you love your job.

11:21.349 --> 11:23.601
Well, I love other things more.

11:26.479 --> 11:28.856
You know, we're gonna
have to tell the girls.

11:28.939 --> 11:30.691
Can you do it?

11:30.775 --> 11:33.444
The whole "mom" thing
is still kind of new to me.

11:33.527 --> 11:34.945
Oh, sure.

11:37.156 --> 11:38.157
Huh?

11:38.908 --> 11:40.951
Psst!

11:50.002 --> 11:51.003
Hello?

12:01.764 --> 12:03.182
<i>Aloha!</i>

12:04.308 --> 12:05.309
Oh!

12:06.143 --> 12:08.521
This is unexpected.

12:08.604 --> 12:10.940
Well, you never got to
go on a honeymoon, so...

12:11.023 --> 12:12.358
We made you dinner!

12:12.441 --> 12:13.567
It's a luau!

12:13.651 --> 12:16.445
We got pineapples and
coconuts and ukuleles!

12:16.529 --> 12:18.280
Oh! Yay!
Yay!

12:31.961 --> 12:34.422
The soup of the day.

12:34.505 --> 12:36.048
<i>Madame</i> and <i>Monsieur.</i>

12:36.465 --> 12:38.384
The gummy bears were my idea.

12:43.180 --> 12:46.350
Mmm! Looks too good
to even eat.

12:46.434 --> 12:47.726
Am I right?

12:48.519 --> 12:50.604
But I made it for you. Oh.

12:52.815 --> 12:54.775
Mmm-mmm-mmm!

12:54.859 --> 12:58.487
Good soup!
I love the combination

12:58.654 --> 13:00.322
of gummy bears

13:00.489 --> 13:01.657
and meat.

13:07.621 --> 13:09.206
I'm gonna hold it in my mouth.

13:09.373 --> 13:11.173
'Cause it's so good, I
don't wanna swallow it.

13:11.333 --> 13:12.793
So, how was work?

13:12.918 --> 13:16.130
Ooh, did you take that guy down?
Did anything explode?

13:16.464 --> 13:18.757
Well, actually,

13:18.841 --> 13:23.429
today, Lucy and I were
invited to not work

13:23.512 --> 13:25.389
at the AVL anymore.

13:25.848 --> 13:27.892
No!

13:30.269 --> 13:31.312
You got fired?

13:31.395 --> 13:33.647
Oh, no!
No, no, no.

13:35.357 --> 13:36.859
Yes.

13:36.942 --> 13:38.736
But don't worry.

13:38.903 --> 13:41.489
I'm sure we'll get
new jobs. Real soon.

13:41.655 --> 13:43.866
Even better ones.

13:43.949 --> 13:46.660
What's better than being
super-cool secret agents?

13:48.412 --> 13:50.664
Ooh, I know!
You could gamble online!

13:50.748 --> 13:52.666
That's what Katie's dad does.

13:52.833 --> 13:55.711
Okay. We will definitely
look into that.

13:55.794 --> 13:57.546
That's a good suggestion.

13:57.713 --> 14:01.342
And let's not go over
to Katie's house anymore.

14:03.093 --> 14:04.094
Hmm?

14:08.182 --> 14:10.518
Guys! Shh! I don't think
you heard me right.

14:10.768 --> 14:11.810
No, no, no.

14:11.894 --> 14:14.563
This does not mean that we are
going back to being villains.

14:17.733 --> 14:19.735
Okay, all right.
I get it.

14:20.110 --> 14:22.446
Look, I know it's been
a little tough lately.

14:22.696 --> 14:27.701
Especially with Dr. Nefario accidentally
freezing himself in carbonite.

14:31.121 --> 14:34.083
But our life of crime is over!

14:35.668 --> 14:38.504
Mel! Mel, you're
with me on this, right?

14:57.982 --> 15:00.609
Guys, listen to me!
Read my lips!

15:07.783 --> 15:08.993
What? What?

15:09.076 --> 15:11.745
Oh... What did I say?
It's not "comquit"?

15:12.538 --> 15:13.539
Ah, okay.

15:15.666 --> 15:17.626
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

15:18.752 --> 15:22.172
Don't take that tone with me!
We're not going back to villainy.

15:23.841 --> 15:26.510
Yes! And I don't want to
hear another word about it.

15:31.140 --> 15:35.269
Look, if you guys don't stop right
now, there will be consequences.

15:37.855 --> 15:39.898
Hey! Don't say anything
you're going to regret.

15:44.653 --> 15:46.030
What? You quit?

15:47.114 --> 15:49.158
You're serious?
Come on!

15:54.830 --> 15:57.499
Dave! Jerry!

15:57.958 --> 16:01.045
Great news, guys.
You have been promoted.

16:01.211 --> 16:04.256
You're in charge now.
Huh? Not bad.

16:13.390 --> 16:14.642
Jeesh!

16:33.744 --> 16:35.913
Ah, <i>Monsieur</i> Pompeux!

16:36.955 --> 16:39.166
To what do we owe the presence

16:39.249 --> 16:42.252
of the world's
foremost gem expert?

16:42.586 --> 16:44.421
The chief of police sent me.

16:44.505 --> 16:47.508
He was concerned that during
the recent heist attempt,

16:47.591 --> 16:50.969
the Dumont Diamond
was replaced with a phony.

17:08.820 --> 17:09.821
Ooh, la-la!

17:10.114 --> 17:12.366
You have been duped!

17:12.907 --> 17:14.117
What? We have?

17:14.451 --> 17:15.452
Yes.

17:15.703 --> 17:16.954
By me!

17:20.582 --> 17:21.625
But, what is...

17:25.212 --> 17:26.255
Oh, no! Help!

17:42.813 --> 17:43.981
Ooh!

17:45.607 --> 17:48.152
I've been a bad boy!

17:48.569 --> 17:49.653
Or should I say...

18:07.171 --> 18:08.172
Oh!

18:31.236 --> 18:32.279
Hey, GRU.

18:32.696 --> 18:34.198
What you doing down here?

18:34.573 --> 18:36.992
In the dark. Alone.

18:37.201 --> 18:39.203
Oh, nothing.
Just thinking.

18:40.078 --> 18:41.330
You okay?

18:41.413 --> 18:44.041
Oh, yes. Yeah, I'm fine.
I'm fine.

18:44.124 --> 18:46.043
It's just...

18:46.126 --> 18:49.922
I don't know.
I guess I just feel like

18:50.005 --> 18:51.632
a failure.

18:52.090 --> 18:54.301
Like I don't have
a purpose anymore.

18:54.384 --> 18:57.429
Hey, mister,
you are not a failure.

18:58.180 --> 19:00.933
If only I could
have nailed Bratt.

19:01.475 --> 19:04.436
So many times, I almost had him.

19:04.812 --> 19:07.231
But now I'll never
get the chance,

19:07.648 --> 19:09.733
'cause I have been
kicked to the curb.

19:09.817 --> 19:11.318
GRU, you've got to let this go.

19:11.401 --> 19:13.070
It's time to look forward.

19:13.153 --> 19:15.405
Things will get
better. I promise.

19:37.886 --> 19:39.346
Excuse me.

19:39.513 --> 19:42.516
Pardon me, young people?

19:43.183 --> 19:45.686
Would you tell me
how to get to this address?

19:50.107 --> 19:52.025
I'm looking for a Mr. GRU.

20:05.289 --> 20:06.498
Idiots.

20:10.210 --> 20:11.712
No! Kyle!

20:11.795 --> 20:13.755
Stop! Kyle, let go!

20:18.093 --> 20:19.094
No! No!

20:19.303 --> 20:21.138
You've got to be kidding me!

20:21.221 --> 20:22.222
Lucy, did you...

20:22.306 --> 20:23.986
He helps you if
you have nightmares.

20:24.308 --> 20:26.435
And he's really
good to snuggle with.

20:26.643 --> 20:27.978
Oh, no, no, no.
Agnes! Agnes!

20:28.103 --> 20:30.147
So take good care of him.

20:30.480 --> 20:31.940
Thank you!

20:32.024 --> 20:34.234
Agnes, what are you doing?

20:34.610 --> 20:36.403
You sold your unicorn?

20:36.778 --> 20:41.074
Well, I just wanted to help,
since you don't have a job.

20:41.158 --> 20:42.993
I got two whole dollars for it.

20:46.496 --> 20:47.706
Uh, excuse me?

20:48.165 --> 20:49.917
Sorry, buddy, the sale's over.

20:50.000 --> 20:51.710
Yes, but this will
only take a...

20:51.793 --> 20:54.338
Hey, eyebrows, get off the lawn.

20:54.421 --> 20:55.589
Yeah, but...

20:55.672 --> 20:56.882
Hey, could you...

20:57.049 --> 20:58.842
Oh, uh, of course.

20:59.009 --> 21:01.386
Now, as I was saying, I...

21:01.511 --> 21:02.596
Uh... Oh.

21:02.679 --> 21:04.139
Goodbye!

21:09.645 --> 21:13.690
Listen, Agnes, you don't need to worry.
We're going to be fine.

21:13.857 --> 21:14.858
For real?

21:15.025 --> 21:16.026
For real.

21:16.193 --> 21:18.320
Now, come on, let's
pack this stuff up.

21:18.403 --> 21:20.197
Ow! Ow!
Seriously?

21:20.906 --> 21:22.658
Buddy, you're not
getting the hint.

21:22.783 --> 21:25.494
Excuse me, Mr. GRU,

21:25.577 --> 21:28.747
but I really must
have a word with you.

21:28.997 --> 21:30.415
How do you know my name?

21:30.707 --> 21:33.961
Allow me to introduce myself.
My name is Fritz.

21:34.044 --> 21:35.754
Ow!

21:35.837 --> 21:37.047
Good puppy.

21:37.214 --> 21:41.593
And I am inquiring on behalf
of your twin brother, Dru.

21:41.885 --> 21:43.178
He needs your help.

21:43.387 --> 21:44.888
What? Twin brother?

21:45.013 --> 21:47.015
Twin brother?

21:47.391 --> 21:48.392
Oh, <i>Ja.</i>

21:48.475 --> 21:51.645
He would like to fly you
to Freedonia to meet him.

21:51.728 --> 21:54.690
Your father has recently
passed away and...

21:54.773 --> 21:56.775
Okay, cuckoo.

21:56.858 --> 21:59.820
I'm sorry, but my dad
died when I was a baby,

21:59.903 --> 22:02.489
and I don't have any brother.
You got the wrong guy.

22:02.572 --> 22:07.285
Really? Well, then,
how do you explain this?

22:14.626 --> 22:16.795
<i>Bellissimo!</i>

22:19.047 --> 22:20.340
Oh, hello, GRU.

22:20.424 --> 22:21.508
Hi, Mom.

22:22.134 --> 22:25.554
It's important to keep active
in one's golden years.

22:25.721 --> 22:27.222
Oh!

22:27.305 --> 22:29.808
There you are, you cutie, you.

22:30.308 --> 22:31.435
Oh!

22:32.811 --> 22:35.689
Uh, these are my
diving instructors.

22:36.106 --> 22:39.109
Vincenzo <i>und</i> Paolo.

22:40.569 --> 22:41.695
Ciao, boys.

22:42.279 --> 22:44.448
So, what do you want?

22:44.990 --> 22:47.701
Mom, do I have a twin brother?

22:47.951 --> 22:50.954
Ah! How did you find out?
Who told you?

22:51.204 --> 22:52.539
Wait, what? It's true?

22:52.622 --> 22:54.583
You never told me
I had a brother!

22:54.666 --> 22:58.170
And you told me that Dad died of
disappointment when I was born.

22:58.253 --> 23:01.423
<i>Ja, Ja</i>.
That was the agreement.

23:01.840 --> 23:04.468
Agreement?
What are you talking about?

23:07.679 --> 23:10.891
Shortly after you and
your brother were born,

23:10.974 --> 23:13.185
your father and I divorced.

23:13.268 --> 23:16.563
We each took one son
to raise on our own

23:16.646 --> 23:20.025
and promised never to
see each other again.

23:21.818 --> 23:23.612
Obviously,

23:23.695 --> 23:25.655
I got second pick.

23:28.492 --> 23:30.452
I have a brother!

23:37.501 --> 23:40.003
Hey, girls! How are
things in Row B, huh?

23:40.170 --> 23:42.631
I put together some fun
activities for the trip!

23:42.798 --> 23:45.717
Who is up for some gin rummy?

23:45.884 --> 23:47.677
Yeah, um...

23:48.512 --> 23:49.638
We're good.

23:49.805 --> 23:51.598
Oh, okay.

23:51.681 --> 23:54.017
I'll just sit here
and play solitaire.

23:54.184 --> 23:55.519
I hope I win.

23:56.561 --> 23:59.272
I wonder what Dru
will be like. Ooh!

23:59.397 --> 24:00.941
Maybe we'll have the twin thing

24:01.024 --> 24:04.027
when you can read
each other's minds, no?

24:04.277 --> 24:05.779
How cool would that be?

24:05.862 --> 24:07.531
Um, super cool!

24:16.873 --> 24:18.583
Ooh!

24:24.881 --> 24:28.885
Freedonia!
Freedonia! Freedonia!

24:29.553 --> 24:31.054
Hi, piggy, piggy!

24:31.388 --> 24:34.182
Whoa!
Look at that house!

24:34.724 --> 24:36.226
It's like a castle!

24:36.685 --> 24:39.896
I can't wait to meet my brother!

24:40.564 --> 24:42.649
Ugh. What's with
all the pigs?

24:42.732 --> 24:45.110
This is the family business.

24:45.193 --> 24:48.488
The largest pig farm in
the whole of Freedonia.

24:49.739 --> 24:52.033
Okay, nice pig.

24:52.117 --> 24:54.578
No! That's my
private part!

24:57.205 --> 24:59.541
This pig has issues!

25:00.292 --> 25:02.002
Please, come in.

25:11.928 --> 25:14.514
Oh, this is amazing!

25:14.931 --> 25:18.560
Ah, it's like the Sistine Chapel!
But with pigs.

25:22.772 --> 25:26.109
My brother!

25:30.780 --> 25:32.407
My brother!

25:32.616 --> 25:33.617
GRU!

25:33.867 --> 25:34.951
Dru!

25:41.166 --> 25:42.167
Oh!

25:43.168 --> 25:47.088
Brother! I am hugging you!

25:47.255 --> 25:48.757
I'm so happy!

25:49.466 --> 25:53.136
After all of these years,
finally I'm meeting you!

25:53.303 --> 25:55.013
Yup. All right.
Good.

25:55.180 --> 25:57.390
Oh, look at that.

25:57.766 --> 25:59.935
You must be the beautiful wife.

26:00.101 --> 26:01.895
Beautiful?
Oh!

26:01.978 --> 26:03.980
Stop it.
Sweet talker.

26:04.147 --> 26:06.107
How is my brother
finding a wife like you

26:06.191 --> 26:07.901
when he is so bald?

26:07.984 --> 26:09.527
I'm joking!

26:11.238 --> 26:15.116
These must be my nieces!

26:15.450 --> 26:19.204
You're Agnes! You
are small with big eyes.

26:19.496 --> 26:21.289
And it makes me wanna
put you into my pocket.

26:21.373 --> 26:22.916
You can't do that!

26:23.166 --> 26:24.834
I'm too big.

26:25.168 --> 26:29.714
Edith! I can tell that you
are a little mischievous.

26:29.881 --> 26:32.092
We're gonna have to make
a little trouble later.

26:32.676 --> 26:34.344
I already have!

26:34.761 --> 26:36.930
Ow! Ow! Please!

26:37.013 --> 26:39.182
Why are you
doing that? Ow!

26:39.808 --> 26:43.061
Fist bump for
mischievous behavior!

26:43.353 --> 26:46.189
And Margo.
Oh, you are so mature!

26:46.356 --> 26:48.817
I'm guessing...
Mmm... 15?

26:49.150 --> 26:50.360
15?

26:50.610 --> 26:53.863
She's 12. She looks 12
and will always be 12.

26:54.739 --> 26:57.033
So, Dru, this place is amazing!

26:57.117 --> 26:59.452
I mean, you just walk through
the doors and you're like...

27:01.204 --> 27:03.456
Oh, it's nice, I guess, sure.

27:03.540 --> 27:05.834
I'm not really into things.

27:08.962 --> 27:11.131
- This is so cool!
- Look at that!

27:11.214 --> 27:13.508
Oh, my gosh!
He's even got a helicopter!

27:13.591 --> 27:14.926
This is the best!

27:15.760 --> 27:17.846
Yes, the best!

27:17.929 --> 27:19.282
All right, let's go home now.

27:19.306 --> 27:20.390
Home? Why?

27:20.598 --> 27:24.019
I don't know. This guy with
the mansion and the cars

27:24.185 --> 27:28.732
and all of the hair, with the
silky smooth, luxurious hair.

27:28.898 --> 27:31.151
I feel worse than
I did before I came.

27:31.401 --> 27:34.321
But he's your brother, GRU.
Give this a chance.

27:34.571 --> 27:35.923
Oh, I was thinking,
while GRU and I

27:35.947 --> 27:37.657
catch up on some brother stuff,

27:37.907 --> 27:40.452
you girls should go with Fritz.
He has a surprise for you!

27:40.577 --> 27:41.995
Yay!
Awesome!

27:42.078 --> 27:43.288
I love surprises!

27:43.455 --> 27:45.415
Oh, this is perfect!
Mother-daughter bonding time.

27:45.498 --> 27:46.708
Let's do it!
Woot-woot!

27:47.542 --> 27:49.878
Bye! You boys
have fun!

27:50.045 --> 27:52.255
Whoopi!

27:55.592 --> 27:57.927
<i>Now you can be as
evil as Balthazar Bratt</i>

27:58.094 --> 28:00.305
<i>with the</i> Evil Bratt
<i>action figure.</i>

28:00.597 --> 28:04.059
<i>Featuring music-activated
breakdance mode.</i>

28:04.142 --> 28:07.645
<i>Also featuring bubblegum-launching
shoulder pads!</i>

28:08.813 --> 28:12.108
<i>And the all-new
Mega Diamond Laser!</i>

28:14.027 --> 28:15.528
<i>No more math!</i>

28:15.779 --> 28:18.073
<i>I've been a bad boy!</i>

28:19.532 --> 28:22.452
<i>The Mega Diamond Laser
does not actually incinerate books.</i>

28:22.619 --> 28:25.205
How could
Hollywood cancel a show

28:25.288 --> 28:27.499
that produced toys
like this, Clive?

28:28.583 --> 28:30.835
<i>Evil Bratt</i> was a masterpiece!

28:31.002 --> 28:33.463
Does no one value
true art anymore?

28:33.755 --> 28:35.715
It's a disgrace
and a travesty, sir.

28:36.132 --> 28:39.552
Well, now that I've got the
diamond, it's payback time.

28:39.844 --> 28:43.598
Oh, it's too bad GRU won't be
around to try and stop me.

28:43.681 --> 28:46.351
Oh, wait! No, it's not.
I hate that dweeb!

28:46.434 --> 28:48.186
And you, Hollywood!

28:48.269 --> 28:51.439
This time, I'm canceling you

28:51.523 --> 28:54.234
and all the losers
who rejected me!

29:00.698 --> 29:01.741
Oh, piggy, piggy!

29:01.825 --> 29:05.078
So, how are things going
for you career-wise?

29:05.412 --> 29:08.790
Great!
So, so great!

29:08.998 --> 29:09.999
Crushing it.

29:10.250 --> 29:12.585
Well, I've got
something that I think

29:12.710 --> 29:15.839
you will find very interesting.

29:18.007 --> 29:19.968
Hold onto your face, brother.

29:26.724 --> 29:29.227
Yee-haw!
Yah, yah!

29:38.319 --> 29:40.071
Ow!

29:50.748 --> 29:51.833
Come on!
Come on!

29:54.210 --> 29:56.171
What is all this?

29:56.713 --> 30:01.009
The pig farm was just a cover
for the real family business.

30:07.557 --> 30:11.352
Now, feast your eyes on

30:11.728 --> 30:14.564
Dad's lair!

30:14.814 --> 30:16.274
Ta-da!

30:16.941 --> 30:19.319
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait.

30:19.402 --> 30:22.489
So, our dad was a villain?

30:22.572 --> 30:24.866
No, no, no, not just a villain.

30:24.949 --> 30:28.077
One of the greatest of all time!

30:28.703 --> 30:32.248
He was known as the Bald Terror!

30:32.999 --> 30:36.002
That's him? Our dad?

30:36.085 --> 30:39.506
He was so proud of you. And
what a great villain you were.

30:39.589 --> 30:41.174
He was?

30:41.716 --> 30:44.844
But me, eh, not so much.

30:44.928 --> 30:49.974
To Dad, I was just a failure.

30:50.767 --> 30:53.394
He never thought I had what
it took to be a villain.

30:53.895 --> 30:56.689
But now, you can help
me prove him wrong!

30:57.565 --> 30:58.900
Brother,

30:59.442 --> 31:01.903
teach me the art of villainy!

31:03.947 --> 31:05.031
No.

31:05.114 --> 31:06.950
No, no, no.
I can't do that.

31:07.116 --> 31:09.744
What? But
it's our family tradition!

31:09.827 --> 31:11.371
You can't say no to that!

31:12.121 --> 31:13.665
Look, I'm sorry.

31:13.748 --> 31:16.751
I left that life behind me.
End of story.

31:17.043 --> 31:18.044
Oh.

31:19.003 --> 31:21.172
Okay. I understand.

31:21.631 --> 31:23.800
Hmm! I wonder
what this does.

31:40.733 --> 31:41.943
Holy Moley!

31:42.026 --> 31:44.153
Dad's villain wheels!

31:44.487 --> 31:46.489
Pretty slick, huh?

31:47.115 --> 31:50.952
Hey, you wanna take her out for a spin?
Just for some fun?

31:52.829 --> 31:54.038
Mmm!

31:59.377 --> 32:01.004
Oh, oh, oh! Look out!

32:04.841 --> 32:06.551
What a beautiful day!

32:06.634 --> 32:09.178
Zero to 400 in three seconds.

32:09.429 --> 32:11.055
Able to withstand
a nuclear blast.

32:11.139 --> 32:12.557
Armed to the teeth.

32:14.142 --> 32:17.103
Okay, that's pretty nice.

32:17.270 --> 32:19.230
And it's a hybrid.
Look out!

32:42.754 --> 32:43.838
Help me!

32:46.466 --> 32:49.385
I am not enjoying this.

32:59.395 --> 33:01.606
Whoa! What is
going on here?

33:01.689 --> 33:05.234
Welcome to the annual
Freedonian Cheese Festival.

33:05.568 --> 33:06.569
Go!

33:10.907 --> 33:14.035
Look, look!
Look at all the candies!

33:14.952 --> 33:16.871
Whoa!
Eep, eep, eep!

33:17.872 --> 33:19.916
Lucy, can we get these? Please.

33:20.375 --> 33:23.044
Okay, but only
one each. I mean it.

33:23.252 --> 33:24.671
Aw!
Oh, man!

33:25.004 --> 33:28.132
No, I don't. Get as
many as you want. I don't care.

33:28.299 --> 33:29.926
Yay! Awesome!

33:30.134 --> 33:31.636
Uh...
What?

33:31.803 --> 33:35.473
Well, it's okay to tell them
no sometimes, too, you know?

33:35.640 --> 33:37.016
Moms need to be tough.

33:37.183 --> 33:39.143
Right, right.
Tough. Good one.

33:39.227 --> 33:40.520
I can totally do that.

33:40.603 --> 33:42.647
You know, still figuring
out this mom thing.

33:42.814 --> 33:45.233
Gettin' my sea legs, matey!

33:45.650 --> 33:47.151
It's a unicorn!

33:52.073 --> 33:54.158
Can we go in there?
Please, please, please!

33:57.620 --> 34:00.665
Um... Sure! Yeah! You
know, but first let's...

34:00.873 --> 34:02.667
Um...
Oh, look!

34:03.084 --> 34:05.086
It's a traditional
Freedonian dance.

34:05.294 --> 34:06.796
How amazing does that look?

34:07.213 --> 34:09.507
<i>Say, say, say cheese!</i>

34:09.924 --> 34:12.009
Cheese! I love this.

34:12.927 --> 34:15.722
The little girls go and get the
cheese from the little boys.

34:15.972 --> 34:17.306
That's adorable!

34:20.059 --> 34:23.896
Aw, look at that poor little guy.
With his little boots.

34:24.147 --> 34:25.773
Nobody picked him.

34:26.399 --> 34:28.400
Oh, Margo, why don't
you go up there?

34:28.568 --> 34:29.569
No way!

34:29.735 --> 34:30.820
Okay.

34:30.987 --> 34:32.112
Wait a minute.

34:32.487 --> 34:33.572
No!

34:33.656 --> 34:35.908
Go take a bite of
his cheese, young lady.

34:35.992 --> 34:38.161
Right now!
What?

34:38.327 --> 34:40.204
I'm being tougher, you know?
Like you said.

34:40.496 --> 34:43.458
No! I meant be tougher on them.
Not me!

34:43.666 --> 34:46.377
Oh, come on, just do it. What's
the worst that could happen?

34:47.170 --> 34:48.170
Mmm...

34:49.464 --> 34:50.547
Fine.

34:55.178 --> 34:56.679
Wow!

34:57.847 --> 34:59.724
Hey, there.
I'm Margo.

35:00.183 --> 35:02.101
Hello, Margo!

35:02.185 --> 35:03.686
I am Niko.

35:03.770 --> 35:05.938
Would you like
some of my cheese?

35:07.398 --> 35:08.399
Mmm...

35:08.566 --> 35:09.668
<i>Say, say, say cheese!</i>

35:09.692 --> 35:12.612
Yes! Thank you, Margo.
Thank you!

35:13.946 --> 35:16.282
Bam! I am a great mother!

35:16.365 --> 35:18.910
Did you see that, girls?
I laid down the...

35:20.036 --> 35:21.954
Oh, no! Where are they?

35:22.371 --> 35:24.749
Oh... Agnes? Edith?

35:27.543 --> 35:28.753
Hello.

35:31.380 --> 35:33.424
Look!
A unicorn horn!

35:36.803 --> 35:39.514
My little brain is
going to explode!

35:39.847 --> 35:41.891
Agnes, that's fake.

35:43.768 --> 35:45.228
It's real, all right.

35:46.479 --> 35:49.524
That horn came from
the Crooked Forest.

35:49.649 --> 35:54.445
The only place on earth
where unicorns still live.

36:00.076 --> 36:01.202
Huh!

36:01.369 --> 36:03.412
Laugh, laugh, all of you.

36:03.996 --> 36:05.915
They all think I'm crazy.

36:06.082 --> 36:09.252
But I'm telling you,
I saw one once.

36:09.418 --> 36:11.170
With my own eye.

36:11.587 --> 36:14.841
Wait, wait, wait. You saw
a for-real live unicorn?

36:14.924 --> 36:16.175
What did it look like?

36:16.259 --> 36:18.261
Did you pet it?
Did it smell like candy?

36:18.469 --> 36:21.264
Was it fluffy?

36:21.556 --> 36:23.266
It was so fluffy,

36:23.683 --> 36:25.935
I thought I was gonna die.

36:26.185 --> 36:29.272
Mmm! Do you think maybe
I could find one, too?

36:29.564 --> 36:32.358
Oh! They say if a maiden
pure of heart

36:32.441 --> 36:34.527
goes into the Crooked Forest,

36:34.610 --> 36:38.447
the unicorn will
come and be hers.

36:38.614 --> 36:39.782
Forever.

36:40.616 --> 36:42.118
Hmm...

36:46.873 --> 36:47.874
Agnes!

36:53.796 --> 36:54.797
Goal!

36:56.007 --> 36:57.675
Excuse me.

36:58.050 --> 36:59.427
Girls, don't worry.
I'm here.

37:00.136 --> 37:01.345
Are you okay?

37:01.929 --> 37:03.598
Yeah, we're fine.

37:03.681 --> 37:05.099
Are you?

37:05.182 --> 37:06.642
Unicorns are really real!

37:06.934 --> 37:09.979
And I'm gonna find one!

37:11.314 --> 37:14.066
Sorry. Went a little
mama bear on ya.

37:14.150 --> 37:15.902
You know,
I heard a scream and...

37:16.027 --> 37:17.867
Yeah, okay, have a good one.

37:22.325 --> 37:23.659
Wait for me here.

37:23.743 --> 37:26.120
Stop that!
Ah! You kicked me.

37:28.331 --> 37:30.917
Hey! Hey!
What are you doing?

37:32.043 --> 37:34.337
Did you just steal candies? Yes!

37:34.503 --> 37:36.672
That's a lot of effort
for two lollipops.

37:42.553 --> 37:44.096
Oh, no! The police!

37:44.180 --> 37:45.598
What do we do?
What do we do?

37:46.182 --> 37:48.768
Come on!
This is gonna be fun!

37:58.819 --> 38:01.405
The police are gonna get us!
I'm freaking out!

38:01.614 --> 38:02.615
Pigs!

38:05.785 --> 38:07.411
Cops!

38:22.218 --> 38:24.053
Whoa! They're back!

38:26.347 --> 38:27.348
All right!

38:48.452 --> 38:51.163
Oh, man, that was crazy!

38:51.247 --> 38:52.748
We were so close
to getting busted.

38:52.832 --> 38:53.916
Tell me about it.

38:54.000 --> 38:56.085
I thought you were going
to pee your pants.

38:56.836 --> 38:58.129
I did!

38:58.212 --> 38:59.672
You did!

39:20.109 --> 39:21.944
Pizza! Pizza! Pizza!

39:27.450 --> 39:28.826
Hey! What are
you doing?

39:29.660 --> 39:31.454
Intruders! Intruders!

39:37.376 --> 39:38.919
There they are! Stop!

39:39.003 --> 39:40.296
Hey, you, don't move!

39:40.546 --> 39:41.547
Halt!

39:47.470 --> 39:48.971
Call for backup!

40:01.859 --> 40:03.069
Ooh, uh...

40:51.617 --> 40:52.868
Get 'em! Go! Go!

41:30.948 --> 41:33.284
Hey, you!
Freeze! Don't move!

41:34.618 --> 41:36.245
Hands in the air!

41:43.919 --> 41:46.714
Face it, GRU. Villainy
is in your blood.

41:47.756 --> 41:50.426
You can't tell me you don't
miss the rush. A little?

41:50.968 --> 41:52.011
Uh...

41:52.094 --> 41:53.762
Eh, maybe a little.

41:53.929 --> 41:56.599
And now you've got the
chance to get back on top.

41:56.765 --> 41:57.808
Get your mojo back.

41:58.100 --> 42:01.687
Become GRU again. How
awesome would that be?

42:02.855 --> 42:03.856
Hmm.

42:04.190 --> 42:07.610
Oh, please, come on.
Just one heist.

42:08.277 --> 42:12.156
There's got to be something
out there, somewhere

42:12.406 --> 42:15.576
that you still wanna steal.

42:17.328 --> 42:18.370
Huh.

42:18.454 --> 42:20.289
There is something.

42:20.456 --> 42:23.375
How about we steal

42:23.459 --> 42:26.670
the largest diamond
in the world?

42:26.837 --> 42:29.215
Yes! I love it!

42:29.340 --> 42:31.592
Oh, thank you, brother!

42:31.675 --> 42:34.470
Thank you from
the bottoms of my heart.

42:36.931 --> 42:39.683
Oh, you know what? We should
do something to celebrate!

42:40.309 --> 42:41.310
Oh!

42:41.393 --> 42:43.938
I've got the perfect idea.

42:47.149 --> 42:50.152
Fritz, my good fellow, could you
get me another napkin, please?

42:50.653 --> 42:52.488
Ah, yes.
Of course, Miss Edith.

42:59.578 --> 43:00.829
Hey, where are GRU and Dru?

43:01.205 --> 43:02.998
Here we are!

43:03.165 --> 43:05.251
Oh, how's it going?

43:06.502 --> 43:08.254
It's me! GRU.

43:08.420 --> 43:10.089
And me, Dru.

43:11.048 --> 43:14.927
I hug everybody whether
they like it or not.

43:15.511 --> 43:17.513
Why are they pretending
to be each other?

43:19.139 --> 43:22.685
Ah! What's for dinner?
I probably won't like it.

43:22.851 --> 43:25.854
I'm so grumpy
all the time. Hmm.

43:26.605 --> 43:30.192
I laugh a lot.
And I'm kind of an idiot!

43:40.619 --> 43:42.288
Oh, I'm busting a gut!

43:42.371 --> 43:45.833
Look at them!
They had no idea!

43:46.542 --> 43:47.876
Total burn.

43:48.085 --> 43:50.129
Oh, look, it's me, GRU!

43:50.212 --> 43:53.090
And I'm Dru!
We switched places!

43:53.382 --> 43:55.843
Oh, it's so nice to see
you two are getting along.

43:56.093 --> 43:58.929
Oh, we're getting...
Along perfectly.

43:59.638 --> 44:01.015
Wait. Did we...
Just finish...

44:01.098 --> 44:02.141
Each...
Other's...

44:02.224 --> 44:03.475
Sentences?
Sentences?

44:05.060 --> 44:07.104
Oh, that's delightful.
Not creepy at all.

44:07.313 --> 44:08.748
And you're gonna stop
now though, right?

44:08.772 --> 44:10.733
Sorry, it's a twin thing.

44:11.025 --> 44:12.192
Uh-huh...

44:12.276 --> 44:15.237
So, uh, what did
you guys do today?

44:15.362 --> 44:18.073
Nothing.

44:18.574 --> 44:19.658
Okay.
What does it...

44:19.742 --> 44:21.493
All done!

44:21.577 --> 44:24.079
Pardon me! Out of the way!
Good night, everybody!

44:24.246 --> 44:26.832
Hey! Hey! Put the brakes on.
What's the rush?

44:26.999 --> 44:29.668
I need to get to bed so I can
wake up and find a unicorn!

44:29.835 --> 44:30.919
Good night!

44:32.921 --> 44:34.173
What was that about?

44:34.465 --> 44:38.177
Agnes thinks she's gonna find a
real unicorn in the woods tomorrow.

44:38.344 --> 44:40.054
She's totally freaking out.

44:40.262 --> 44:42.681
I feel like someone's
gotta tell her the truth.

44:42.765 --> 44:43.766
Not it!

44:44.433 --> 44:48.187
Oh, don't worry.
Parenting 101. I got this.

44:50.647 --> 44:51.690
Um...

44:51.774 --> 44:53.942
And please bless that
when I find the unicorn

44:54.109 --> 44:56.653
he'll want to come home with
me, and sleep in my room.

44:57.029 --> 44:59.698
And that I can ride him
to school every day.

45:00.366 --> 45:03.786
And he'll use his magical
powers to help me do math.

45:03.952 --> 45:05.037
Amen.

45:07.873 --> 45:09.124
Oh, hi, GRU.

45:10.125 --> 45:13.962
Hey. So, big day tomorrow.

45:14.213 --> 45:17.966
Yeah, I'm finally gonna get
to see a unicorn. For reals.

45:18.801 --> 45:21.637
If I do, can I bring it home?
Please?

45:21.804 --> 45:23.889
Oh, yeah. Sure.

45:24.056 --> 45:28.477
Tell you what, every unicorn you
find, you can bring it home.

45:28.644 --> 45:31.313
I'd better build
a big pen, right?

45:32.356 --> 45:34.983
But, you know,

45:35.067 --> 45:38.153
there's a chance that
you might not find one.

45:39.238 --> 45:40.239
Huh?

45:42.324 --> 45:46.328
It might not be good
unicorn-finding weather.

45:48.664 --> 45:52.334
Um... They're tricky
to find them.

45:52.835 --> 45:56.588
And I don't know.
Maybe...

45:56.755 --> 45:59.842
Maybe unicorns

46:00.050 --> 46:03.303
don't really

46:04.555 --> 46:09.518
explore that part of the woods.

46:12.229 --> 46:17.025
But the man said a maiden could
find one if she was pure in heart.

46:17.192 --> 46:19.653
And I'm pure in heart, right?

46:20.696 --> 46:22.072
The purest.

46:26.535 --> 46:30.038
Can we stop talking now?
I need to get to sleep.

46:30.205 --> 46:31.373
Good night, sweetie.

46:31.707 --> 46:33.083
Good night, GRU.

46:34.543 --> 46:36.545
<i>Unicorns, I love them</i>

46:37.087 --> 46:39.214
<i>Unicorns, I love them</i>

46:40.382 --> 46:42.217
Huh!

46:43.927 --> 46:45.220
I'm okay.

46:53.937 --> 46:55.689
Hey! Give
that back!

47:00.444 --> 47:01.945
Oh, no! Run!

47:27.971 --> 47:30.766
We've been waiting
a long time. Can we...

47:30.849 --> 47:32.184
No!

47:32.267 --> 47:34.186
No, please!

47:35.270 --> 47:36.605
GRU?

47:37.773 --> 47:38.857
Uh-oh!

47:51.328 --> 47:52.371
Ha!

48:13.600 --> 48:15.310
Huh?

48:37.249 --> 48:40.836
<i>Because
I'm training for the big day</i>

48:41.128 --> 48:43.255
<i>Nobody's gonna stop me</i>

48:43.672 --> 48:45.841
<i>'Cause I am super sassy</i>

48:46.008 --> 48:48.343
<i>Super sassy, super sassy</i>

48:49.428 --> 48:51.346
What's today's plan, boss?

48:51.513 --> 48:53.932
What's the plan?
Silly robot.

48:54.182 --> 48:55.434
I'll show you the plan!

48:55.517 --> 48:58.645
Time to watch a very special
episode of <i>Evil Bratt</i>

48:58.729 --> 49:02.065
to see exactly what I'm gonna
do to stupid Tinseltown.

49:03.609 --> 49:06.320
<i>This week on</i> Evil Bratt...

49:08.447 --> 49:11.450
<i>It's a giant Evil Bratt robot!</i>

49:11.533 --> 49:12.701
<i>Open fire!</i>

49:12.784 --> 49:13.952
<i>I have him in my sights!</i>

49:18.248 --> 49:21.001
<i>Nice try, coppers!
Chew on this!</i>

49:24.379 --> 49:25.964
<i>He's shooting his super sticky,</i>

49:26.048 --> 49:27.633
<i>self-inflating gum!</i>

49:28.050 --> 49:29.635
<i>Run!</i>

49:30.677 --> 49:32.638
<i>Gum one, gum all!</i>

49:34.681 --> 49:36.516
"Gum one, gum all."

49:36.600 --> 49:39.478
Seriously, how did this
show never win an Emmy?

49:42.397 --> 49:46.234
<i>And now, it's your turn
to shine, my diamond!</i>

49:58.413 --> 50:01.333
<i>Hey, Clive. I guess you
could say our plan was</i>

50:01.416 --> 50:03.293
<i>out of this world!</i>

50:07.464 --> 50:09.675
Now, that's entertainment!

50:09.925 --> 50:12.135
Come on!
Let's make it a reality!

50:15.972 --> 50:19.434
<i>Here we are, in the dark
and creepy Crooked Forest</i>

50:19.601 --> 50:21.520
<i>in search of
the mythical unicorn.</i>

50:21.687 --> 50:23.105
<i>For some reason.</i>

50:23.271 --> 50:26.483
<i>And here she is! The fearless
unicorn hunter seeking...</i>

50:26.650 --> 50:28.026
<i>Edith, stop it!</i>

50:28.276 --> 50:30.445
You're gonna scare
away the unicorn.

50:30.529 --> 50:32.614
If, somehow, we actually
find a unicorn,

50:32.698 --> 50:34.741
I'm gonna film it and get rich.

50:34.825 --> 50:36.159
Look over there!

50:37.285 --> 50:38.453
Whoa!

50:39.162 --> 50:40.163
This is it!

50:40.247 --> 50:41.623
This is where we're
gonna see it.

50:42.332 --> 50:44.960
Unicorns, here we come.

50:45.627 --> 50:46.627
What's that for?

50:46.670 --> 50:48.588
Bait! Duh.

50:48.672 --> 50:49.673
Come on!

50:52.134 --> 50:54.177
Now, all we have to do is wait.

50:58.557 --> 51:01.393
Okay, this is Bratt's lair.
It may not look like much,

51:01.476 --> 51:03.270
but this place is
armed with some of

51:03.353 --> 51:05.230
the most high-tech
weaponry known to man.

51:05.313 --> 51:06.982
It's considered impenetrable.

51:07.649 --> 51:10.527
But a piece of cake
for us, right, brother?

51:10.819 --> 51:14.239
Yes. This is not
like stealing lollipops.

51:16.324 --> 51:17.325
Whoa!

51:19.578 --> 51:24.124
His security system can detect an
air assault from any direction.

51:26.501 --> 51:29.171
<i>Ouch! No! Ouch!</i>

51:29.337 --> 51:31.506
<i>Please, stop! Ouch!</i>

51:33.133 --> 51:36.511
So we'll have to approach low
and close to the water.

51:36.595 --> 51:38.847
Next. Ah...

51:39.431 --> 51:41.641
Then there are
these deadly spikes.

51:42.058 --> 51:44.019
<i>Geronimo!</i>

51:44.686 --> 51:48.356
Covered with enough
poison to blow your mind.

51:48.565 --> 51:49.566
Literally.

51:49.691 --> 51:51.067
<i>Ouch!</i>

51:51.610 --> 51:52.861
Ah, good to know.

51:53.195 --> 51:56.698
So here's the plan.
You're the getaway driver.

51:56.990 --> 51:58.867
So you'll wait in the boat...

51:59.075 --> 52:01.161
Wait, hold on!
Wait in the boat?

52:01.244 --> 52:04.206
But I wanna be
in on the actions!

52:05.373 --> 52:09.294
Dru, the getaway driver is the
most crucial part of any plan.

52:09.377 --> 52:11.797
Do you know how hard it is

52:11.880 --> 52:14.007
doing nothing, touching nothing

52:14.090 --> 52:17.052
when all of that adrenaline
is coursing through your veins

52:17.135 --> 52:18.720
and you must wait?

52:18.804 --> 52:20.180
Can I count on you?

52:20.597 --> 52:21.723
Yeah.

52:21.973 --> 52:23.558
Ah, I guess so.

52:23.767 --> 52:27.312
So, I'll climb up to
the cube and enter here.

52:27.395 --> 52:29.898
Then once I'm inside,
find the diamond.

52:30.315 --> 52:34.027
I've underestimated Bratt before.
It's not going to be easy.

52:34.402 --> 52:36.238
I think we can handle it.

52:38.907 --> 52:42.410
Dad's villain suits!
This will make us unstoppable!

52:42.911 --> 52:44.621
Whoa! <i>Ay, chihuahua!</i>

52:45.080 --> 52:46.832
I call the black one.

52:49.251 --> 52:51.419
It's go time!

53:02.013 --> 53:03.139
Hello.

53:03.223 --> 53:04.266
Oh, hi!

53:04.474 --> 53:07.602
Hello, mother of Margo.
I am Niko.

53:07.727 --> 53:09.771
I present you
with pig to confirm

53:09.855 --> 53:12.691
my engagement to your daughter.

53:13.608 --> 53:15.735
Hey, what now?

53:15.819 --> 53:17.612
What's going on?
Uh, remember little boots?

53:18.113 --> 53:21.032
Hello, my schmoopsie poo.
Whoa, hey!

53:21.616 --> 53:24.327
He seems to think you're engaged.

53:24.411 --> 53:26.663
What? We're
not engaged.

53:26.746 --> 53:30.959
Look, Niko, you seem like a very
nice boy with a very nice pig.

53:31.459 --> 53:33.420
Uh... But you're
not engaged.

53:34.462 --> 53:36.256
Okay? It's not
happening.

53:36.965 --> 53:38.341
I understand.

53:38.925 --> 53:40.385
Who was I kidding?

53:40.468 --> 53:43.388
A dumpling like me
with a goddess like you.

53:44.014 --> 53:47.684
But I promise, I will
never forget you, Margo.

53:48.435 --> 53:49.603
Never.

53:51.104 --> 53:53.815
Oh, I'm pretty sure I won't
forget you either.

53:53.899 --> 53:55.400
Bye. Bye, Niko.

53:56.276 --> 53:58.653
Wow! That was crazy.
Whoa!

53:58.737 --> 54:00.906
That was totally humiliating.

54:01.072 --> 54:03.992
Taking a bite of that cheese was the
stupidest thing I've ever done.

54:04.159 --> 54:05.493
Why did I listen to you?

54:05.660 --> 54:07.495
Right. But it's over
now, so...

54:08.663 --> 54:10.707
Oh! Here we go.
Niko...

54:11.583 --> 54:15.003
You refuse my
son's engagement pig?

54:15.170 --> 54:16.171
What?

54:16.254 --> 54:18.840
May you and your
daughter die a slow death

54:18.924 --> 54:20.425
and be buried with onions.

54:23.219 --> 54:24.596
All right, lady, that's it!

54:24.679 --> 54:25.680
Nobody...

54:25.847 --> 54:29.976
Nobody curses my daughter!
Ya got that?

54:30.352 --> 54:33.438
Because if you mess with
Margo, you mess with me!

54:33.521 --> 54:37.567
And I promise, you do
not wanna mess with me.

54:37.859 --> 54:39.945
Do you understand me?

54:40.195 --> 54:41.196
Yes. Yes.

54:41.279 --> 54:43.615
Good.
Now get!

54:47.452 --> 54:49.704
Look, Margo, I think
we just need to... Oh.

54:53.875 --> 54:54.876
Yes!

54:54.960 --> 54:57.212
I have to tell GRU!

55:12.936 --> 55:14.729
Can we go back now?

55:14.896 --> 55:17.816
Already? Just
a couple more hours.

55:18.066 --> 55:19.859
We have to be home
before it gets dark.

55:20.276 --> 55:23.238
I don't understand.

55:23.405 --> 55:25.573
I did exactly what the man said.

55:25.824 --> 55:28.952
You mean that one-eyed scar-faced
man that everybody laughed at?

55:29.202 --> 55:31.371
Yeah, it makes no sense.

55:31.538 --> 55:32.778
Look, Agnes, maybe we're not...

55:44.759 --> 55:48.138
Ooh, my whole life has been
building to this moment.

55:53.852 --> 55:55.854
Um... It's a...

55:55.937 --> 55:57.647
Unicorn!

55:58.690 --> 56:01.151
I can't believe it!

56:02.027 --> 56:04.154
I'm gonna name you Lucky!

56:05.030 --> 56:07.115
Oh, Lucky, stop it!

56:08.950 --> 56:11.953
Yeah, I'll let someone
else burst her bubble.

56:18.585 --> 56:21.963
Look at us! Two brothers
pulling a heist!

56:22.130 --> 56:24.841
And that diamond will
make us the richest,

56:24.924 --> 56:27.552
most powerful
villains in the world!

56:27.719 --> 56:28.887
Right, brother?

56:29.179 --> 56:32.974
Oh, right. Yep, yeah.

56:35.393 --> 56:38.313
Bravo! <i>Bravissimo!</i>

56:38.480 --> 56:39.981
You're amazing!
I'm so sorry.

56:40.065 --> 56:41.608
I'm so embarrassed.
I was very rude.

56:41.733 --> 56:43.544
And you were always such a gentleman.
You did it!

56:43.568 --> 56:45.820
You did it!
You got our jobs back!

56:51.743 --> 56:54.412
What?
Oh, yeah, right. Sure.

56:54.579 --> 56:55.955
Oh, look.
We're here!

57:03.421 --> 57:05.840
I'm going in. Take the wheel.

57:06.049 --> 57:07.967
I still don't see why
I can't go with you.

57:08.134 --> 57:09.677
Hey, hey!
We discussed this.

57:09.761 --> 57:12.180
Now is not the time
to mess with the plan.

57:12.347 --> 57:13.431
Fine.

57:25.985 --> 57:26.986
Ha-ha!

57:27.362 --> 57:28.822
Hey, brother!

57:28.905 --> 57:31.741
What? I told you, you are
supposed to stay with the boat!

57:31.825 --> 57:34.911
Oh, I didn't think you
meant that literally.

57:35.036 --> 57:36.913
What other way
could I have meant it?

57:37.497 --> 57:40.458
All right. Let's move.
Just follow my lead.

57:41.167 --> 57:42.877
Got it.

57:43.419 --> 57:44.420
Whoa!

57:44.712 --> 57:46.631
Help me!

57:46.798 --> 57:48.133
Ow, ow, ow!

57:48.216 --> 57:50.218
Oh, no! The poison spikes!

57:50.885 --> 57:52.011
I'm gonna be impaled!

57:55.014 --> 57:56.599
I'm okay.

57:57.267 --> 57:59.352
I miss the minions.

57:59.519 --> 58:00.520
Come on!

58:06.734 --> 58:07.902
Coming.

58:14.075 --> 58:15.076
Coming.

58:19.622 --> 58:20.623
Come on.

58:26.963 --> 58:28.603
It's a scanning device.

58:28.715 --> 58:30.133
Quick!
Camouflage mode.

58:30.341 --> 58:32.510
Freeze! And
close your eyes!

58:33.219 --> 58:34.512
And cover your mouth!

58:40.852 --> 58:42.228
Okay, take my hand.

59:05.877 --> 59:08.379
Ha-ha! Follow me.

59:25.605 --> 59:26.606
Ha-ha!

59:31.945 --> 59:33.571
Look out!

59:37.742 --> 59:40.995
Oh, you were right. I should
have stayed in the boat.

59:41.079 --> 59:43.873
My stomach feels all queasy.

59:43.957 --> 59:46.751
I shouldn't have
eaten that pot pie.

59:48.336 --> 59:52.507
Hey, hey, relax.
You're gonna be just fine.

59:52.590 --> 59:53.841
I got your back.

01:00:00.807 --> 01:00:02.100
Come on. This way.

01:00:38.136 --> 01:00:39.137
Huh?

01:00:42.807 --> 01:00:43.808
Hmm?

01:01:33.941 --> 01:01:35.526
Looks like it's right above us.

01:01:35.693 --> 01:01:38.237
Okay, what do I do?
Should I wait in the vent?

01:01:38.404 --> 01:01:39.781
No, come with me.

01:01:53.127 --> 01:01:54.629
Dru, get off the bed!

01:01:55.463 --> 01:01:57.632
Yes, I'd like to
thank the Academy...

01:02:00.301 --> 01:02:01.636
I can help.
No, no, no.

01:02:01.803 --> 01:02:03.238
What? I can do it.
Don't! Don't! Don't!

01:02:03.262 --> 01:02:04.263
Why, yes.

01:02:04.430 --> 01:02:07.100
Yes, Molly Ringwald, I will take
you to the prom.

01:02:07.308 --> 01:02:10.436
What? Who? Where? What?
Who's there? Who is there?

01:02:18.111 --> 01:02:20.780
<i>99 of red balloons</i>

01:02:21.030 --> 01:02:22.323
Whoops! Almost forgot!

01:02:33.543 --> 01:02:35.503
Over here.

01:02:37.338 --> 01:02:38.840
Stay close.

01:02:41.801 --> 01:02:42.802
What?

01:02:43.261 --> 01:02:44.595
Dolls.

01:02:44.679 --> 01:02:46.597
Looks like Bratt
was the only one

01:02:46.681 --> 01:02:48.599
stupid enough to buy this junk.

01:02:48.683 --> 01:02:51.519
Oh, I used to have one of these!

01:02:56.983 --> 01:02:58.484
Ow!
Hey! Shh! Come on.

01:03:06.826 --> 01:03:09.120
All right.
We're getting close.

01:03:09.787 --> 01:03:11.539
From now on,
every move must be made

01:03:11.664 --> 01:03:13.875
with total
precision and purpose.

01:03:16.085 --> 01:03:17.128
Gum!

01:03:17.211 --> 01:03:18.379
Focus!

01:03:18.671 --> 01:03:21.591
We're after the diamond,
not the bubblegum.

01:03:21.674 --> 01:03:22.884
Got it!

01:03:25.303 --> 01:03:26.679
Mmm. Yum.

01:03:28.473 --> 01:03:29.849
This way!

01:03:30.516 --> 01:03:33.478
And now, to put this
where it belongs.

01:03:34.729 --> 01:03:35.730
What...

01:03:35.897 --> 01:03:39.066
Look at it, Clive.
It's beautiful!

01:03:45.406 --> 01:03:47.450
Will you please shut up?
He's gonna spot us!

01:03:49.911 --> 01:03:53.414
Spit it out! Spit it out!
I told you not to touch anything!

01:03:57.126 --> 01:03:59.670
Intruders!
Intruders! Intruders!

01:04:02.256 --> 01:04:04.300
Freeze, dipsticks!

01:04:04.383 --> 01:04:06.677
GRU? There's two
of you now?

01:04:06.761 --> 01:04:09.514
Then this will be twice as much fun.

01:04:10.097 --> 01:04:11.098
GRU.

01:04:16.979 --> 01:04:18.397
Give me back my diamond!

01:04:18.648 --> 01:04:19.941
Total lockdown!

01:04:20.024 --> 01:04:22.276
Oh!
Go get 'em, Bratt Pack!

01:04:31.118 --> 01:04:33.246
They're gonna get us!
They're gonna get us!

01:04:35.540 --> 01:04:37.208
Run!

01:04:48.177 --> 01:04:49.178
Oh, no!

01:04:49.428 --> 01:04:51.097
What does that mean?

01:04:51.305 --> 01:04:53.683
Are we gonna die?
Are we gonna die?

01:04:54.058 --> 01:04:55.768
We're gonna die!
Dru!

01:05:04.068 --> 01:05:06.487
What?

01:05:07.238 --> 01:05:09.156
Hey, guys. Hold on!

01:05:09.448 --> 01:05:10.950
Lucy!

01:05:17.999 --> 01:05:20.793
Thank you for saving us.
Whoo!

01:05:20.960 --> 01:05:23.170
Look! We got the diamond
and we're going to...

01:05:23.421 --> 01:05:26.507
Take it to the AVL
and get our jobs back.

01:05:26.674 --> 01:05:27.842
Wait!

01:05:28.009 --> 01:05:29.635
What? Oh,
that's amazing!

01:05:29.719 --> 01:05:31.721
And the best part is,
you'll never...

01:05:31.846 --> 01:05:33.806
ever go behind my back...

01:05:33.931 --> 01:05:37.268
ever again, right, honey bear?

01:05:37.351 --> 01:05:39.562
Yeah! Yeah, right.

01:05:39.645 --> 01:05:41.105
Lesson learned.

01:05:54.493 --> 01:05:55.933
I'll get the girls
and start packing.

01:05:55.995 --> 01:05:57.115
And tell them the good news!

01:05:57.204 --> 01:05:59.124
Ah! We're getting
our jobs back. Yeah!

01:05:59.290 --> 01:06:01.375
Yes! Yes!
Go tell the girls.

01:06:02.335 --> 01:06:03.336
Dru...

01:06:03.544 --> 01:06:06.631
No! No way! We can't
give the diamond back!

01:06:06.714 --> 01:06:07.965
I have to.

01:06:08.049 --> 01:06:10.092
No, you don't!
Yes, I do.

01:06:10.176 --> 01:06:11.594
- Give it!
- No!

01:06:11.844 --> 01:06:13.054
Give it!
Ow!

01:06:13.429 --> 01:06:14.639
What is wrong with you?

01:06:14.847 --> 01:06:15.848
What is wrong with you?

01:06:16.057 --> 01:06:17.099
You kicked me!

01:06:17.224 --> 01:06:18.351
You... You lied to me!

01:06:18.434 --> 01:06:20.269
Hey, I would have
told you the truth.

01:06:20.353 --> 01:06:23.147
But you're too much
of a wimp to handle it.

01:06:23.230 --> 01:06:24.523
That's it.
I'm out of here.

01:06:24.815 --> 01:06:27.735
You have no right to take that.
We stole it together.

01:06:27.943 --> 01:06:29.654
Together?

01:06:29.737 --> 01:06:31.072
You got to be kidding me.

01:06:31.238 --> 01:06:33.366
You did nothing but screw up
the whole time.

01:06:33.449 --> 01:06:34.700
I got this in spite of you.

01:06:35.076 --> 01:06:38.871
Oh, yeah? At least I didn't
get fired from my job

01:06:38.954 --> 01:06:40.414
like a total loser.

01:06:40.665 --> 01:06:42.249
At least I had a job.

01:06:42.333 --> 01:06:44.335
What have you accomplished
that was so great?

01:06:44.418 --> 01:06:47.046
I'll tell you what. Nothing!

01:06:47.755 --> 01:06:50.591
No wonder Dad thought
you were such a failure.

01:06:53.177 --> 01:06:55.012
We are no longer brothers.

01:06:55.096 --> 01:06:56.889
That's fine with me.

01:07:39.390 --> 01:07:42.518
GRU! I found
a unicorn!

01:07:44.979 --> 01:07:46.522
My life is complete!

01:07:49.483 --> 01:07:51.026
Honey, that's...

01:07:51.110 --> 01:07:53.738
That's not actually a unicorn.

01:07:54.280 --> 01:07:55.281
Huh?

01:07:55.906 --> 01:07:59.452
But, but, he has one horn.

01:07:59.827 --> 01:08:02.663
I'm...
I'm sorry, sweetie...

01:08:02.788 --> 01:08:05.166
but he's just a goat.

01:08:05.583 --> 01:08:08.711
Life is just
like that sometimes.

01:08:08.794 --> 01:08:12.715
We're hoping for a unicorn,
and we get a goat.

01:08:15.301 --> 01:08:17.303
Well, you know what?

01:08:17.470 --> 01:08:21.432
Lucky is the best goat
in the whole wide world!

01:08:21.599 --> 01:08:25.144
Look at that face! I
just want to squeeze it.

01:08:25.352 --> 01:08:26.353
Mmm!

01:08:27.438 --> 01:08:30.107
Whoo-hoo!
Whoo!

01:08:30.191 --> 01:08:31.776
I'll take this.

01:08:31.942 --> 01:08:34.694
You've been a bad boy, GRU.

01:08:35.029 --> 01:08:36.509
Can you get the rest
of the suitcases?

01:08:37.031 --> 01:08:38.657
Come on, girls.
Let's go!

01:08:38.823 --> 01:08:42.368
<i>Let's get physical, physical</i>

01:08:49.752 --> 01:08:51.420
Change of plans, girls.

01:08:51.504 --> 01:08:53.839
Instead of going home...

01:08:54.006 --> 01:08:56.008
Eyebrows! Ow!

01:08:56.383 --> 01:08:58.636
We're going to Hollywood!

01:09:00.679 --> 01:09:03.098
Now, that's what I call acting.

01:09:03.349 --> 01:09:06.769
Let's go, Clive!
We've got a giant robot waiting!

01:09:10.523 --> 01:09:11.564
Huh?

01:09:12.691 --> 01:09:14.527
Lucy?

01:09:14.652 --> 01:09:16.362
But...

01:09:16.444 --> 01:09:17.779
Bratt! He took the girls!

01:09:18.072 --> 01:09:19.990
What? No!

01:09:22.952 --> 01:09:24.495
Dru! Dru!

01:09:24.953 --> 01:09:27.372
Go away!
I don't wanna talk to you.

01:09:27.581 --> 01:09:29.582
Bratt has the girls!

01:09:36.465 --> 01:09:39.343
Listen, brother.
About what I said...

01:09:39.426 --> 01:09:40.761
No, I'm the one...

01:09:40.928 --> 01:09:42.263
But I shouldn't have...

01:09:42.555 --> 01:09:44.098
I'm... I'm sorry.

01:09:45.599 --> 01:09:47.768
I'm so sorry, GRU.

01:09:48.269 --> 01:09:49.270
Aw!

01:09:50.520 --> 01:09:51.772
Ooh, look out!

01:09:51.981 --> 01:09:52.982
What is that?

01:10:01.740 --> 01:10:02.783
Mel?

01:10:03.158 --> 01:10:04.618
GRU?

01:10:38.944 --> 01:10:42.031
Hello, Hollywood!

01:10:42.323 --> 01:10:44.909
<i>I'm back and bigger than ever.</i>

01:10:47.077 --> 01:10:48.537
I'm scared!

01:10:48.746 --> 01:10:51.123
Thank you.
Thank you so... Oh!

01:10:55.252 --> 01:10:56.253
No! No!

01:10:56.587 --> 01:10:58.339
No, you can't leave me here!

01:10:58.505 --> 01:10:59.757
I'm famous!

01:10:59.965 --> 01:11:02.718
Clive, arm the canons.

01:11:05.846 --> 01:11:07.681
<i>Chew on this!</i>

01:11:24.949 --> 01:11:27.201
Hey, mullet head!
Let us out!

01:11:27.660 --> 01:11:32.665
Oh, don't worry, girls. I've
prepared a front row seat for you.

01:11:48.806 --> 01:11:50.057
Agnes!

01:11:52.226 --> 01:11:55.562
<i>Once again, I win and GRU loses!</i>

01:11:55.854 --> 01:11:57.564
<i>Enjoy the show, girls.</i>

01:12:05.489 --> 01:12:06.740
What in the heck?
Oh!

01:12:07.282 --> 01:12:08.951
I hope the girls are okay.

01:12:09.118 --> 01:12:12.246
Bratt! Bratt at nine o'clock...
No! Three o'clock!

01:12:12.413 --> 01:12:13.580
He's on the left!

01:12:15.958 --> 01:12:18.252
No!
I've seen this episode!

01:12:18.419 --> 01:12:21.422
He's going to bubblegum the whole
city and send it up into space!

01:12:21.588 --> 01:12:23.465
Hurry!

01:12:33.809 --> 01:12:36.103
This is it! This is it!

01:12:36.186 --> 01:12:38.480
Lights! Camera!

01:12:38.564 --> 01:12:39.606
Laser!

01:12:50.200 --> 01:12:51.493
Yeah!

01:12:57.624 --> 01:12:58.625
Look!

01:12:58.876 --> 01:13:01.045
I've got the girls. You
two, go take care of Bratt.

01:13:01.211 --> 01:13:02.963
Wait! What are
you doing?

01:13:09.261 --> 01:13:10.721
Look, you guys, it's Lucy!

01:13:10.804 --> 01:13:12.973
Lucy, over here!
Help! Help us!

01:13:13.140 --> 01:13:14.683
Mama's comin', girls.

01:13:14.850 --> 01:13:16.643
- Lucy! Lucy!
- We're up here!

01:13:17.519 --> 01:13:18.812
<i>Look at that laser go.</i>

01:13:19.063 --> 01:13:21.190
I love it when
a plan comes together.

01:13:21.315 --> 01:13:23.525
It's GRU!

01:13:26.320 --> 01:13:27.446
Get ready, Bratt.

01:13:27.529 --> 01:13:30.324
You're about to be
blasted back to the '80s!

01:13:37.164 --> 01:13:38.665
Whoo-hoo!

01:13:42.419 --> 01:13:44.797
We got him!

01:13:53.722 --> 01:13:55.099
Oh, no!
Don't worry.

01:13:55.182 --> 01:13:56.850
There's more
where that came from.

01:13:57.059 --> 01:13:59.770
It'll take more
than that to stop me.

01:13:59.895 --> 01:14:02.397
Bratt Pack, go get that barf bag.

01:14:10.531 --> 01:14:12.032
Oh, incoming!

01:14:15.244 --> 01:14:16.245
You little...

01:14:16.537 --> 01:14:18.956
Get away!
Get out of there!

01:14:24.044 --> 01:14:25.045
Quick, jump!

01:14:27.965 --> 01:14:29.133
Bonus!

01:14:29.383 --> 01:14:31.969
Did you see that, Clive? All gone.

01:14:32.052 --> 01:14:33.637
Buh-bye,
Wonder Twins.

01:15:02.374 --> 01:15:03.750
Help!

01:15:04.793 --> 01:15:05.919
Hang on!

01:15:13.594 --> 01:15:15.971
Hang on, girls!
I've got you!

01:15:16.180 --> 01:15:19.516
I can't! I'm slipping!

01:15:20.142 --> 01:15:21.435
No!

01:15:22.561 --> 01:15:23.979
Got ya!

01:15:26.940 --> 01:15:28.108
Thank you, Lucy!

01:15:28.275 --> 01:15:30.694
Let's go!
We're not safe yet.

01:15:33.822 --> 01:15:35.449
Minions!

01:15:59.640 --> 01:16:01.520
Look at what we have here.

01:16:01.808 --> 01:16:05.771
Sorry, GRU. This is going to
be a total burn!

01:16:11.193 --> 01:16:13.654
Oh, no! No, no, no!

01:16:18.450 --> 01:16:20.994
I've been a bad boy!

01:16:29.169 --> 01:16:32.506
Nobody messes with my brother!

01:16:44.101 --> 01:16:46.061
What? What's happening? No!

01:16:59.074 --> 01:17:00.075
Dru!

01:17:01.535 --> 01:17:02.911
Hold on! I'm coming.

01:17:07.582 --> 01:17:10.127
You've ruined everything!

01:17:10.294 --> 01:17:12.462
And now, it's time to die.

01:17:12.796 --> 01:17:14.840
Any last words, GRU?

01:17:15.716 --> 01:17:17.175
You know what?

01:17:17.259 --> 01:17:19.469
I got two words for you.

01:17:20.470 --> 01:17:21.555
Dance fight.

01:17:22.931 --> 01:17:26.143
Oh, it is on like Donkey Kong.

01:17:26.893 --> 01:17:29.396
I am going to enjoy this.

01:17:48.623 --> 01:17:49.624
Enough!

01:17:50.334 --> 01:17:51.918
My turn!

01:18:12.064 --> 01:18:13.315
Uh-oh.

01:18:16.902 --> 01:18:18.779
Game over!

01:18:21.031 --> 01:18:23.742
Is this what you're looking for?

01:18:24.159 --> 01:18:25.160
No!

01:18:35.212 --> 01:18:37.047
No!

01:18:40.967 --> 01:18:43.470
Curse you, GRU!

01:18:43.887 --> 01:18:45.222
Curse you!

01:18:54.398 --> 01:18:56.316
Dru? Dru?

01:19:04.366 --> 01:19:06.326
Hey! We did it!

01:19:06.827 --> 01:19:08.829
Yes, we did, brother.

01:19:09.454 --> 01:19:10.534
- GRU!
- Uncle Dru!

01:19:11.081 --> 01:19:12.582
GRU!
Girls!

01:19:26.179 --> 01:19:27.222
GRU!

01:19:27.305 --> 01:19:29.558
Hey, Mel. Welcome back.

01:20:00.046 --> 01:20:01.047
Mmm.

01:20:02.883 --> 01:20:04.301
Love you, Mom.

01:20:09.139 --> 01:20:10.474
I'm a mom.

01:20:10.557 --> 01:20:13.018
I'm a mom!

01:20:28.241 --> 01:20:30.494
Boys, time for bed!

01:20:30.660 --> 01:20:32.245
We're back at work
in the morning.

01:20:32.913 --> 01:20:34.372
I'm coming, sweetie.

01:20:34.456 --> 01:20:35.832
Good night, Lucy.

01:20:35.916 --> 01:20:37.626
See you tomorrow, brother.

01:20:37.876 --> 01:20:39.336
Hey, I'm back on the job.

01:20:39.419 --> 01:20:41.922
So no villainy tonight,
huh? Got it?

01:20:42.297 --> 01:20:45.300
I make no promises.
Love you!

01:20:45.592 --> 01:20:47.594
Uh-huh. Right.

01:20:47.677 --> 01:20:48.762
I love you, too.

01:20:49.262 --> 01:20:50.597
Aw!

01:20:51.348 --> 01:20:54.768
"Aw!" All right, every...
Go! Go! Go to bed!

01:20:59.606 --> 01:21:01.691
Hey! Guys! Come on!

01:21:19.251 --> 01:21:20.544
What...
What is happening?

01:21:20.627 --> 01:21:22.170
It's coming from outside!

01:21:24.714 --> 01:21:28.134
Hey! I thought we
said no more villainy!

01:21:28.301 --> 01:21:29.386
Sorry, brother!

01:21:29.469 --> 01:21:33.390
Somebody's gotta keep the
family tradition alive, right?

01:21:43.525 --> 01:21:45.569
Let's get him.
Ugh.

01:21:45.652 --> 01:21:47.946
Honey, he's my brother.

01:21:48.029 --> 01:21:49.990
We'll give him a
five-minute head start.
