WEBVTT

00:11.760 --> 00:13.880
[Uhtred] I am Uhtred, son of Uhtred.

00:14.880 --> 00:20.160
My brother, Ragnar, died not as a warrior,
but was murdered in his bed.

00:20.240 --> 00:22.200
He cannot enter the hall of the gods.

00:22.840 --> 00:27.160
He will spend eternity
in the cold of Niflheim because of you.

00:27.240 --> 00:29.560
You will wet the blade
with Ragnar's blood.

00:29.640 --> 00:32.640
Only that way will he be free
to enter Valhalla.

00:32.720 --> 00:34.640
Might his blood be in others?

00:35.800 --> 00:36.760
Thyra?

00:37.400 --> 00:41.480
[Uhtred] Skade has me tortured.
I cannot resist her.

00:41.560 --> 00:44.520
Your path is the path I choose for you,
Uhtred Ragnarson.

00:44.600 --> 00:46.320
Your spirit is mine to torment.

00:46.920 --> 00:50.040
[Uhtred] And although
I have now taken her from Haesten,

00:50.120 --> 00:52.360
her curse still holds me.

00:52.440 --> 00:54.800
She has invaded my heart and my mind.

00:56.480 --> 00:59.200
-[grunts]
-She is poison to all men.

00:59.280 --> 01:00.400
How do you kill a curse?

01:00.480 --> 01:03.800
Without breaking the skin
or shedding one drop of blood.

01:04.239 --> 01:06.200
And you've got to do the same to Skade.

01:06.760 --> 01:10.720
[Uhtred] In Winchester, a political union
has been arranged for Edward.

01:11.320 --> 01:13.800
But he has loved and abandoned another.

01:14.280 --> 01:15.760
I am married to Ecgwynn.

01:15.840 --> 01:18.400
Your wife will be dealt with.

01:18.480 --> 01:21.280
-[Steapa] You're Ecgwynn.
-I'm confiscating the children.

01:21.360 --> 01:24.600
They shall belong to the church
and dedicate their lives to God.

01:25.400 --> 01:28.240
[Uhtred] Edward has a jealous enemy,
Lord Sigebriht,

01:28.800 --> 01:31.520
who wanted his secret wife, Ecgwynn,
for himself.

01:32.120 --> 01:33.760
She is confined to a nunnery.

01:34.520 --> 01:38.080
I would understand it entirely
if you could not serve Edward.

01:38.160 --> 01:43.800
[Uhtred] Under his Danish masters' orders,
Aethelwold has returned to Wessex.

01:43.880 --> 01:45.280
I wish to speak to the king.

01:45.560 --> 01:48.960
[Uhtred] But his treason is known
to the dying Alfred.

01:49.040 --> 01:51.880
Aethelwold's failings
were born from my own.

01:51.960 --> 01:55.560
My brother, who I loved,
who am I to take his son's life?

01:55.640 --> 01:56.920
The punishment...

01:57.680 --> 01:59.160
is blinding.

01:59.720 --> 02:01.440
[muffled screaming]

02:02.800 --> 02:04.040
[Uhtred] Destiny is all.

02:04.120 --> 02:06.120
[theme music playing]

03:18.640 --> 03:19.760
Trust me.

03:26.800 --> 03:28.200
[Skade inhales sharply]

03:33.200 --> 03:36.480
I have seen the rebirth
of Uhtred Ragnarson.

03:38.160 --> 03:42.280
I have seen 50 men become 500
and then 5,000,

03:42.760 --> 03:44.680
with more joining him by the day.

03:46.200 --> 03:52.280
And I have seen Alfred fall at last
and Uhtred rise.

03:56.080 --> 03:57.400
Taste me.

04:47.280 --> 04:51.040
May I say what an honor it is has been
to ride alongside the Lady of Mercia.

04:51.880 --> 04:55.080
Does it trouble you so much, Lord,
that your wife is respected?

04:55.160 --> 04:56.400
If not respectable.

04:57.320 --> 05:01.400
There'll be plenty of ale and wine
at this wedding. I suggest you refrain.

05:01.480 --> 05:03.560
You do not like me enjoying myself?

05:03.640 --> 05:05.120
I do not like you drunk.

05:06.280 --> 05:08.880
Perhaps this wedding
will be followed by a funeral.

05:09.360 --> 05:11.040
A sobering enough thought.

05:28.360 --> 05:30.480
May I ask, Father Beocca, how is he?

05:32.360 --> 05:33.880
How is our king?

05:34.880 --> 05:37.560
He is prepared for whatever may come.

05:38.240 --> 05:41.440
Both Alfred and Edward
are in my prayers daily...

05:43.240 --> 05:44.240
nightly.

05:46.760 --> 05:49.120
It must be a worrying time
for you, Father.

05:50.520 --> 05:53.640
What becomes of the king's advisor
when the king is no more?

05:53.720 --> 05:56.440
-I, too, am prepared.
-And to have no influence.

05:57.400 --> 05:59.600
-Does not concern me.
-No protection.

06:01.880 --> 06:04.000
I have God. He is all I need.

06:04.080 --> 06:05.760
And you have a wife, Father.

06:07.520 --> 06:09.120
Do not forget your wife...

06:10.240 --> 06:13.160
of strong, Dane stock.

06:15.760 --> 06:18.320
Why am I not surprised
to hear you threaten a woman?

06:19.680 --> 06:23.520
Father Beocca, please, forgive me my sins.

06:29.600 --> 06:31.560
I shall leave you to your prayers.

06:32.480 --> 06:34.640
If indeed that is what you are here for.

06:35.240 --> 06:37.920
[Aethelwold] I shall watch out for you,
Father Beocca,

06:38.400 --> 06:39.840
with my good eye.

06:48.640 --> 06:50.400
I'd rather we meet at the alehouse.

06:50.480 --> 06:53.000
Father Beocca is already imagining
a conspiracy.

06:53.080 --> 06:54.600
Because he is afraid.

06:55.560 --> 06:57.320
Like the whole of Wessex is afraid.

06:58.640 --> 07:02.440
The king is dying
and a child is about to take his place.

07:05.200 --> 07:07.160
What are your thoughts on the matter?

07:10.000 --> 07:11.720
-The matter of Edward?
-Being king.

07:14.120 --> 07:16.680
It is the purpose of the witan
to choose a king.

07:16.760 --> 07:17.640
It is.

07:18.680 --> 07:21.560
Yet Alfred would have us
refer to him as Edward Rex.

07:21.640 --> 07:22.640
[scoffs]

07:26.160 --> 07:28.600
Men are saying that Uhtred
is in Edward's debt.

07:30.600 --> 07:33.560
That Uhtred will reappear
and swear an oath to Edward--

07:33.640 --> 07:36.120
Then we must instruct other men
to say otherwise!

07:40.120 --> 07:41.640
I will pay them if needs must,

07:41.720 --> 07:44.520
but we cannot allow
Edward's reputation to grow.

07:47.440 --> 07:48.400
"We"?

07:50.720 --> 07:52.560
Are we of the same mind or not?

07:54.640 --> 07:57.000
Are we prepared to act or not?

07:57.080 --> 08:00.520
Does the challenge to Edward
begin here or not?

08:00.600 --> 08:01.760
It does.

08:03.080 --> 08:06.080
It does. Edward cannot succeed.

08:08.880 --> 08:12.800
So, these are the facts of the matter.

08:14.600 --> 08:19.400
Uhtred blames Alfred for his banishment
and for the loss of his land and wealth.

08:20.320 --> 08:24.800
Alfred is near death. Uhtred will,
therefore, take his revenge upon Edward.

08:26.440 --> 08:29.320
Uhtred Ragnarson,
which is how he now wishes to be known,

08:29.400 --> 08:31.840
wants Wessex for the Danes.

08:34.720 --> 08:37.640
That's the news our men shall repeat,
and repeat and repeat

08:37.720 --> 08:39.559
until it becomes the absolute truth.

08:42.440 --> 08:46.200
Uhtred cannot be allowed
to ally himself to Edward.

08:47.520 --> 08:49.280
-Ever.
-I understand.

08:50.320 --> 08:54.200
Right now, it's you and I against the boy,
but only because Alfred lives.

08:55.600 --> 08:59.680
The very instant he dies,
then fear and doubt will grow.

09:01.200 --> 09:05.120
The people will not wish their fate to be
in the hands of a smooth-faced child.

09:05.560 --> 09:06.720
We must be ready.

09:06.800 --> 09:08.040
We must be ready.

09:10.200 --> 09:11.760
And we must be ruthless.

09:27.760 --> 09:31.600
[Finan] Is the idea we walk into Coccham
like we've never been away?

09:31.680 --> 09:33.480
-Yes.
-Directly to the hall?

09:33.560 --> 09:36.000
-Yes.
-And if another lord resides there?

09:36.560 --> 09:39.400
-We ask him to leave, my friend.
-I can do that.

09:42.320 --> 09:44.520
Are we to expect a wedding, Lord?

09:45.800 --> 09:49.160
We did not risk our lives
for you to hump the bitch.

09:49.240 --> 09:52.640
-Do you plan to kill her with your cock?
-I plan to see my children.

09:52.720 --> 09:55.520
Lord... you will not remember me.

09:55.600 --> 09:58.280
I remember. You're Edwin.
You're married to Mildwynn.

09:58.360 --> 10:02.120
Lord, they have taken more than half
our winter's store. Animals and grain.

10:02.200 --> 10:05.720
They say it is to feed Alfred's army,
but we will certainly starve.

10:05.800 --> 10:08.240
-Who did this?
-They're at the hall, Lord.

10:09.440 --> 10:11.240
Alfred would not have ordered this!

10:11.320 --> 10:14.200
[Uhtred] Stand aside.
I want no blood shed, no man killed.

10:17.400 --> 10:20.120
He said stand aside! Now!

10:22.440 --> 10:25.120
Thank you.
I should not need to raise my voice.

10:30.600 --> 10:31.440
Uhtred?

10:32.480 --> 10:35.720
Uh, what is the meaning of this invasion?

10:35.800 --> 10:37.120
This is my home.

10:41.280 --> 10:44.840
We are here by right,
on the king's business.

10:44.920 --> 10:47.480
You are stealing food
from the mouths of the poor.

10:47.800 --> 10:49.880
An army needs to be fed.

10:49.960 --> 10:51.320
As do priests, it seems.

10:52.720 --> 10:54.320
You're lucky it's not your hand.

10:54.400 --> 10:56.680
We want no disharmony here today.

11:01.680 --> 11:02.960
[Uhtred] What is that?

11:03.520 --> 11:06.120
Well, you know what it is.

11:07.600 --> 11:08.520
Take it down.

11:10.320 --> 11:13.240
Take it down
or I will make a gift of you to Skade.

11:17.320 --> 11:19.080
I will not do as you ask.

11:20.680 --> 11:21.520
I cannot.

11:21.600 --> 11:23.920
Lord, see it as a piece of wood,
nothing more.

11:24.000 --> 11:25.800
It is a holy cross.

11:25.880 --> 11:28.320
Bishop Erkenwald, shut your holy mouth.

11:28.400 --> 11:29.720
And take it down.

11:29.800 --> 11:32.320
Or I... I can just take it down, Lord.

11:32.400 --> 11:33.880
[Uhtred] You will do nothing.

11:37.080 --> 11:41.040
I realize you are looking to find a reason
to kill me,

11:41.400 --> 11:43.760
and I would prefer to do as you ask.

11:44.560 --> 11:47.840
I'm not a fool,
but I cannot deny my faith.

11:48.600 --> 11:50.840
The king will hear of it.
God would know of--

11:50.920 --> 11:54.840
The king has told me many times
that this is a pagan's hall.

11:57.800 --> 11:59.120
You will take it down.

11:59.200 --> 12:01.160
[Hild] It is my cross, Lord.

12:01.960 --> 12:06.160
My doing. I put it there.
And I would like it to remain there,

12:06.800 --> 12:10.160
unless of course, your plan
is to once again be the Lord of Coccham.

12:11.120 --> 12:12.280
I meant no insult.

12:13.120 --> 12:14.000
[Skade grunts]

12:20.600 --> 12:22.320
Now, perhaps, we may eat.

12:26.440 --> 12:27.280
You may take it.

12:30.600 --> 12:34.120
When you leave, you will take
only half of what you have gathered.

12:34.680 --> 12:38.800
I understand an army must be fed,
but my village will not starve.

12:39.360 --> 12:40.800
The king will not approve.

12:40.880 --> 12:42.680
The king is a ghost...

12:44.040 --> 12:45.240
nothing more than that.

12:47.440 --> 12:51.080
Lord, may we speak further, privately?

12:53.240 --> 12:56.840
-Good to see you, Lord.
-And you, Abbess Hild.

12:56.920 --> 12:59.920
-Should you be here?
-I came to see my children.

13:01.960 --> 13:04.000
Do not react, do not revolt.

13:04.480 --> 13:06.800
They're not here. They're at Winchester.

13:07.800 --> 13:08.640
With Thyra?

13:09.920 --> 13:11.800
Under the Crown's care. Good care.

13:11.880 --> 13:13.960
-The Crown?
-They are well. I swear it.

13:14.040 --> 13:16.440
They can't be in the care
of nuns and priests.

13:16.520 --> 13:19.640
They're well and happy.
I have seen it. You have been absent.

13:19.720 --> 13:22.240
If Alfred is not already dead,
I will kill him.

13:22.320 --> 13:25.080
-He does this to damn me further?
-He does not.

13:25.160 --> 13:27.840
Have they been made Christian? Baptized?

13:27.920 --> 13:30.120
-It will do them no harm--
-He has no right!

13:30.800 --> 13:33.640
He has done this to damn me
and to damn my wife!

13:34.880 --> 13:37.120
Lord, you, too, should eat.

13:37.800 --> 13:38.880
Later.

13:38.960 --> 13:41.480
-You should eat now, my love.
-I said later.

13:43.280 --> 13:44.440
As you wish.

13:48.120 --> 13:49.720
She's your woman now?

13:51.440 --> 13:54.000
-A man needs a woman.
-You replace Gisela with her?

13:55.080 --> 13:57.400
Who I bed is no business of an abbess.

13:57.960 --> 13:59.560
I am speaking as a friend.

14:02.160 --> 14:05.560
It's good to see you're well.
Back to your usual self, in fact.

14:08.200 --> 14:10.120
-Hild...
-[sighs]

14:13.000 --> 14:14.560
I have been absent.

14:22.480 --> 14:25.480
I would like to see my children
at Winchester.

14:27.440 --> 14:28.400
Can you help?

14:29.560 --> 14:33.200
Yes, I can help you.
Of course I can help you.

14:34.080 --> 14:37.080
But Bishop Erkenwald will tell
of your visit here in Wessex.

14:37.800 --> 14:39.200
They'll be watching for you.

14:41.400 --> 14:42.520
You look thin.

14:43.520 --> 14:44.840
You should eat, my love.

14:49.280 --> 14:50.480
-Finan.
-Lord?

14:51.600 --> 14:54.120
Have the priests unload
half of what they've taken.

14:54.200 --> 14:56.800
Send them back to Alfred.
You will ride with them.

14:57.160 --> 15:00.640
-All the way to Winchester?
-I will follow and find you.

15:00.720 --> 15:03.240
-And what of Skade?
-She stays with me.

15:05.120 --> 15:08.040
I will find you in Winchester.
I must be there. Unseen.

15:08.120 --> 15:10.520
And if Alfred decides to take me hostage?

15:10.600 --> 15:15.080
He will have you watched, nothing more.
You need only drink ale and find a woman.

15:15.920 --> 15:17.040
I can do that.

15:18.400 --> 15:20.320
We all need a good woman!

15:33.440 --> 15:34.560
Father Beocca!

15:37.200 --> 15:39.600
Father, there is talk
that your friend, Uhtred,

15:39.680 --> 15:42.640
has sworn revenge against Alfred.

15:43.320 --> 15:45.800
-Revenge? For what?
-Being outcast.

15:45.880 --> 15:49.160
And should Alfred die,
they say he will kill Edward.

15:49.240 --> 15:51.200
That is nonsense. Who is saying this?

15:51.280 --> 15:55.040
It does not sound like a nonsense to me,
Father, nor to the men here.

15:55.960 --> 15:59.520
Uhtred fought shoulder to shoulder
with Edward. You were there, Lord.

15:59.600 --> 16:01.600
I was, so why is Uhtred not here?

16:02.160 --> 16:03.960
Why does he remain outlawed?

16:05.040 --> 16:07.960
Why is Uhtred being punished
for killing Danes?

16:08.360 --> 16:10.720
He is not being punished
for killing Danes.

16:11.960 --> 16:15.040
-He threatened the king's life.
-And continues to do so?

16:15.840 --> 16:20.080
Uhtred of Bebbanburg would never dare
to harm Alfred nor Edward.

16:22.600 --> 16:24.720
But what of Uhtred Ragnarson, Father?

16:27.680 --> 16:31.040
Ealdormen are arriving
from across the land for the celebrations.

16:31.600 --> 16:35.960
You shouldn't be talking out of your arse.
So from now on, Lord, buttocks clenched.

17:04.880 --> 17:06.200
Supper's in the pot.

17:15.040 --> 17:17.520
There's a pile of dirt. Soil.

17:18.720 --> 17:19.560
Where?

17:21.119 --> 17:22.119
Outside the door.

17:26.280 --> 17:29.040
You're thinking of something
more than a pile of dirt.

17:31.120 --> 17:34.600
God forgive me, but I wish
Alfred would close his eyes and die.

17:35.520 --> 17:38.160
The longer he lingers,
the more anxious people grow.

17:39.120 --> 17:40.680
Then he should end it himself.

17:41.960 --> 17:44.040
He should take a sword to his heart.

17:44.600 --> 17:45.680
He's the king.

17:47.080 --> 17:48.760
It is what a sword-Dane would do.

17:50.200 --> 17:54.560
Alfred is holding on to life only because
he worries what'll happen once he's gone.

17:56.480 --> 18:00.080
What will happen is fate.
We all die, Beocca.

18:05.360 --> 18:07.840
It is how we live that matters.

18:11.520 --> 18:16.800
If the Danes do come to Wessex,
people will see you only as a Dane.

18:18.360 --> 18:20.840
I worry I will not be able to protect you.

18:20.920 --> 18:22.640
The gods will decide what happens.

18:23.360 --> 18:24.200
"God."

18:25.480 --> 18:26.680
That is what I said.

18:29.160 --> 18:30.160
[chuckles softly]

18:31.400 --> 18:33.440
[Uhtred] My men are free men still.

18:33.520 --> 18:36.560
They'll go with you to Winchester,
ensure your safe return.

18:37.120 --> 18:40.560
I have a guard.
And Wessex is not a land of banditry.

18:40.640 --> 18:42.440
Priests and ealdormen aside,

18:42.520 --> 18:45.920
you should never refuse
the offer of a sword, Bishop Erkenwald.

18:49.080 --> 18:52.200
Is it your intention to remain at Coccham?

18:52.280 --> 18:55.920
It's not. My Lord's intention
is to rule at Winchester.

18:56.000 --> 18:56.840
Is that right?

18:58.760 --> 19:00.160
My business is my own.

19:00.720 --> 19:03.280
-And your children?
-Are Christian now.

19:04.200 --> 19:05.840
I will ensure they're cared for.

19:06.400 --> 19:07.520
If it pleases you.

19:07.600 --> 19:11.160
I will bring my wife to Mercia, Lord.
Meet you there.

19:18.720 --> 19:21.800
What is happening? Why is she not dead?

19:22.800 --> 19:25.120
She has beauty and power, Osferth,

19:25.840 --> 19:28.240
over men who believe
in their own reputation.

19:28.320 --> 19:30.680
[Osferth] She's evil.
He has promised her death.

19:30.760 --> 19:33.760
Pray for him. He'll need it.

19:48.880 --> 19:50.760
You and I can be everything together.

19:55.120 --> 19:58.320
-I want you to believe in me, Uhtred.
-I do.

19:59.960 --> 20:03.880
[Skade] Like I believe in you,
the warrior above all men.

20:06.360 --> 20:07.600
You're a king.

20:10.240 --> 20:11.720
Then you are my queen.

20:25.880 --> 20:28.560
[Skade] I am yours and you are mine.

20:29.480 --> 20:32.120
To love. To guide.

20:33.840 --> 20:35.160
To own.

20:42.960 --> 20:44.440
I own you.

20:45.000 --> 20:46.840
[breathing heavily]

21:10.560 --> 21:12.560
[breathing heavily]

22:32.280 --> 22:36.320
I thought you would need a fire, Lord.
Something warm to eat.

22:44.360 --> 22:45.960
[exhales heavily]

22:53.240 --> 22:54.400
You saw?

22:59.280 --> 23:00.160
I did.

23:02.480 --> 23:05.240
I am not proud of what I've done.

23:05.320 --> 23:07.480
But it was necessary, Lord.

23:09.920 --> 23:12.960
She was of the devil
and you are free of her now.

23:15.920 --> 23:17.040
Why are you here?

23:18.040 --> 23:19.440
I could not leave, Lord.

23:20.920 --> 23:23.600
You feared I could not rid myself
of the curse?

23:25.480 --> 23:26.440
I did.

23:31.520 --> 23:33.800
I stayed here for the Lady Gisela, Lord.

23:35.280 --> 23:39.040
This is her hall
and there was no kinder, gentler lady.

23:42.880 --> 23:45.320
You clearly did not know the Lady Gisela.

24:04.760 --> 24:08.880
The, uh, marriage arrangements,
Father Beocca...

24:10.400 --> 24:11.480
What progress?

24:12.400 --> 24:16.200
Are all but complete.
The guests have begun arriving

24:16.280 --> 24:19.840
and the alehouses of Winchester
have been brewing day and night.

24:20.400 --> 24:24.400
It will be the shortest of ceremonies,
Lord, as you have requested.

24:26.600 --> 24:30.160
-Are you comfortable, Lord?
-I am not, but it will do.

24:30.760 --> 24:32.880
The Danes, they are encamped still?

24:33.440 --> 24:36.480
They do not move.
They have not moved from the River Ouse.

24:36.840 --> 24:38.400
We continue to watch.

24:38.800 --> 24:41.840
The defeat of Haesten and Bloodhair
have weakened them, Lord.

24:44.160 --> 24:45.120
Aethelwold...

24:46.440 --> 24:47.800
What of him, Lord?

24:48.840 --> 24:52.760
He is here not just for forgiveness.
He too must be watched.

24:52.840 --> 24:53.880
He should be dead.

24:57.760 --> 25:01.160
Although this move from the inn
to the palace is long overdue,

25:01.240 --> 25:04.280
it comes
at a very inconvenient time of day.

25:04.360 --> 25:07.080
Were you due
to hump an alehouse whore, Lord?

25:10.720 --> 25:12.400
Aelflaed, continue to the palace.

25:17.520 --> 25:20.280
I was due to eat, nothing else.

25:20.840 --> 25:21.920
Yes, Lord.

25:22.320 --> 25:24.840
If people have been gossiping,
they are wrong.

25:24.920 --> 25:29.920
As I hope they are wrong about Edward
having a whore and children.

25:38.560 --> 25:39.960
[Edward] Lord, good morning.

25:40.840 --> 25:42.760
Whilst you are speaking with the king,

25:42.840 --> 25:46.240
I was hoping I could spend a few moments
with Lady Aelflaed.

25:47.960 --> 25:50.760
With respect, I do not think
that would be appropriate.

25:55.440 --> 25:59.240
I have heard talk
that you have bastard children.

25:59.800 --> 26:01.040
Is this true?

26:01.120 --> 26:07.640
I thought we had agreed to leave
all alehouse gossip at the alehouse, Lord.

26:13.320 --> 26:16.400
Lord, perhaps you could direct
the Lady Aelflaed to her room.

26:17.560 --> 26:18.520
[Edward] Of course.

26:23.720 --> 26:27.000
Do not dwell... Lord.

26:35.440 --> 26:36.720
The guards may leave us.

26:38.560 --> 26:39.960
You will leave us.

26:40.040 --> 26:42.080
Yes, you! Outside!

26:43.280 --> 26:45.880
There's nothing
beneath their helmets but straw.

26:47.520 --> 26:50.040
-Aethelhelm.
-Lord King.

26:52.120 --> 26:55.120
May I say you appear
a little better this morning.

26:56.440 --> 26:57.320
Thank you.

26:57.400 --> 27:00.640
[Aelswith] The king has much to do today.
We shall keep it brief.

27:00.840 --> 27:04.080
He has called you here to discuss
the strength of Edward and Aelflaed.

27:04.640 --> 27:05.840
"Strength," Lady?

27:05.920 --> 27:08.600
Of the Crown, once Edward is king.

27:08.680 --> 27:11.760
Assuming the witan's approval.
Is that guaranteed?

27:11.840 --> 27:14.160
If the present king
may be allowed to speak?

27:19.480 --> 27:20.640
Uhtred.

27:21.120 --> 27:23.040
A scoundrel, an outlaw.

27:23.120 --> 27:25.400
-A warrior.
-[Aethelhelm] A heathen, surely?

27:25.480 --> 27:28.240
Christian by birth and baptism.

27:28.320 --> 27:30.360
-That is true?
-[Beocca] It is true.

27:30.440 --> 27:32.920
-He is an outlaw.
-If the king may speak.

27:37.360 --> 27:39.720
Uhtred is also a man of his word.

27:41.320 --> 27:45.120
Should Edward, once king,
decide to take him into his service,

27:45.200 --> 27:46.680
that would be no bad thing.

27:47.400 --> 27:52.360
Lord, this is the man who held a knife
to your throat, so I am told.

27:52.440 --> 27:53.320
He did.

27:53.600 --> 27:56.360
And for as long as I live,
he will remain an outlaw.

27:56.440 --> 28:02.040
However, once I am dead,
and should he become Edward's oath man,

28:02.120 --> 28:05.440
I am advising you
that his word will be kept.

28:05.520 --> 28:06.760
I hear you, Lord.

28:08.040 --> 28:08.920
[Alfred] Good.

28:09.000 --> 28:12.680
Perhaps you would like to get on
with the business of your morning, Lord?

28:14.120 --> 28:16.720
One point of clarification.

28:18.000 --> 28:22.000
Uhtred is an outlaw
or he is not an outlaw?

28:22.080 --> 28:24.680
-He is very much an outlaw.
-He is.

28:24.760 --> 28:28.320
If he were found today on Wessex soil,
he would be executed.

28:28.400 --> 28:30.840
But Edward may take
a different view once king.

28:30.920 --> 28:32.200
[Aelswith] Or he may not.

28:33.280 --> 28:38.000
Above all else,
Uhtred does what pleases Uhtred.

28:38.800 --> 28:41.880
-None of us should forget that fact.
-Make no mistake.

28:41.960 --> 28:44.280
Edward will need the guidance
of a warrior.

28:48.360 --> 28:52.040
-The king is tired.
-The king is not a child.

28:53.360 --> 28:55.160
[inhales]

28:57.520 --> 28:59.520
I shall go about my business.

29:00.600 --> 29:04.640
Lord, Lady, thank you for your confidence.

29:11.360 --> 29:17.000
If you value the outlaw so highly,
then why do you not pardon him?

29:19.040 --> 29:20.280
Beocca, would you leave us?

29:22.000 --> 29:22.840
Yes, Lord.

29:31.120 --> 29:33.840
It is my body that is weak, not my mind.

29:33.920 --> 29:35.720
I know that, Lord. I understand.

29:35.800 --> 29:37.960
Then why do you question me? Why doubt me?

29:38.040 --> 29:39.600
I don't doubt you. I would not--

29:39.680 --> 29:42.120
Edward will need a sword,
a warrior at his side.

29:42.200 --> 29:44.680
He has Steapa, who is God-fearing.

29:44.760 --> 29:45.960
He will need Uhtred.

29:49.200 --> 29:52.200
He will need a man who knows
how to fight and when to fight,

29:52.280 --> 29:54.160
because the fighting will continue.

29:56.840 --> 30:01.120
Until the Danes learn of the benefits
of peace, it will continue.

30:04.640 --> 30:06.360
You may leave me, my dear.

30:09.200 --> 30:10.280
As you wish.

30:17.120 --> 30:20.480
I do not pardon Uhtred, firstly,
because he would not accept

30:20.560 --> 30:23.480
and, secondly,
it must be Edward's decision.

30:25.720 --> 30:29.720
And it will be your responsibility
to guide him towards the correct decision.

30:34.560 --> 30:35.840
Meanwhile, we are agreed.

30:35.920 --> 30:39.760
Should he set foot in Wessex,
he will be executed.

30:44.000 --> 30:45.160
Lord.

30:54.600 --> 30:56.280
[Sihtric] Finan, look.

31:03.440 --> 31:04.720
Should you investigate?

31:07.200 --> 31:11.040
Any spare coins, Lord? Any spare food?
God would bless you, I'm sure.

31:11.120 --> 31:14.800
-Are you traveling to Winchester?
-We are, Lord. For the wedding.

31:14.880 --> 31:16.120
We shall see you there.

31:16.200 --> 31:17.880
And a good day to you, Lord.

31:19.320 --> 31:20.800
Miserable bastard.

31:30.640 --> 31:36.600
Lord God, give me strength and guidance
to do your work.

31:47.960 --> 31:53.040
If it is right and proper
to rely upon a heathen,

31:54.560 --> 31:59.120
albeit for violence, then I beg you...

32:01.400 --> 32:02.720
show me a sign.

32:05.000 --> 32:06.000
Help me.

32:10.960 --> 32:12.640
[crying]

32:12.720 --> 32:17.400
I want my son to remain untarnished
by heathen ways.

32:20.520 --> 32:24.360
I wish him to be God's king.

32:26.360 --> 32:27.280
Pure.

32:33.480 --> 32:36.640
Lord. Should you be walking unaided?

32:39.280 --> 32:40.480
While I can, I will.

32:52.400 --> 32:55.520
[Alfred breathing heavily]

32:56.720 --> 32:58.400
I wish to sit in peace.

33:00.920 --> 33:02.200
Of course.

33:08.880 --> 33:09.960
Steapa.

33:13.640 --> 33:14.480
Steapa!

33:20.080 --> 33:21.080
Ah!

33:22.320 --> 33:25.600
Do you not recognize me, Steapa?
Why have the gates not opened?

33:26.240 --> 33:29.760
Bishop Erkenwald, you have guests.

33:30.320 --> 33:32.040
They rode with us from Coccham.

33:32.120 --> 33:36.480
Where Uhtred remains.
He'll be going directly to Mercia.

33:36.560 --> 33:39.240
Steapa, he had hoped
to visit his children there.

33:40.600 --> 33:43.480
-This is true, Lord?
-[Hild] You do not believe me?

33:43.560 --> 33:47.120
[Erkenwald] It is true
that Uhtred Ragnarson remains at Coccham.

33:47.680 --> 33:49.440
That is all I know to be true.

33:49.520 --> 33:51.400
[Hild] Uhtred wants to go to Mercia.

33:51.480 --> 33:53.880
I am to ask the king
to have his children follow.

33:53.960 --> 33:56.440
Now open the gates and let us rest.

33:57.360 --> 34:02.760
Hey, big man. We're guilty of being hungry
and tired, my friend. That is all.

34:08.480 --> 34:09.960
Open the gates.

34:10.040 --> 34:12.520
[gates opening]

34:30.159 --> 34:31.960
[musician] Hold! Hold the gates.

34:32.040 --> 34:33.199
Hold! Hold.

34:34.239 --> 34:36.000
We've traveled from Cent, Lord,

34:36.080 --> 34:39.080
to bring smiles and laughter
to the streets of Winchester.

34:44.320 --> 34:46.480
-Let them pass.
-Thank you, Lord.

35:00.080 --> 35:05.720
Is that Aethelwold the sword-Dane I see?
Looks like you've mislaid an eye.

35:05.800 --> 35:10.120
I see you perfectly, Finan.
Though I do not see your master.

35:12.480 --> 35:13.920
Uhtred. Where is he?

35:15.400 --> 35:17.920
Standing at your blind side, perhaps.

35:24.960 --> 35:27.520
[Aethelwold] If his men are here,
Uhtred will not be far.

35:28.560 --> 35:31.000
I fear he's here for the revenge
we've spoken of.

35:32.480 --> 35:34.520
Then we must inform the king, perhaps.

35:35.480 --> 35:39.160
If we are to be successful
in usurping the usurper, Edward,

35:39.240 --> 35:41.120
Uhtred must be put to the sword.

35:44.720 --> 35:48.880
I would like the grain and the animals
taken to the palace stores immediately.

35:48.960 --> 35:53.200
Your men have been telling me
there's to be a wedding, Lord?

35:53.280 --> 35:55.840
Edward is to marry, yes. A sweet girl.

35:56.440 --> 35:59.400
I, uh... I do enjoy a wedding.

36:00.240 --> 36:04.600
Ale flows and kisses
are a little easier to come by.

36:05.600 --> 36:07.640
I might stay a short while.

36:09.880 --> 36:13.640
You are welcome, Finan, I'm sure,
as are your people.

36:15.560 --> 36:19.360
Finan, I'm away to find my wife.

36:19.840 --> 36:22.120
Um, she'll be underneath some man.

36:23.120 --> 36:26.840
And you'll recognize her
by the size of her big... feet.

36:27.640 --> 36:29.760
-I still love her.
-[Finan laughs]

36:30.840 --> 36:33.600
-Finan!
-What the... Osferth, you're here?

36:33.680 --> 36:38.640
So, we are inside the walls of Winchester.
Where will he go? To Father Beocca?

36:39.320 --> 36:42.880
Yes. He'll find us. Be sure of it.

36:43.440 --> 36:45.000
And he is free of his curse.

36:47.680 --> 36:49.560
-She's dead?
-Very.

36:51.600 --> 36:53.840
Then we're all free of the curse,
baby monk.

36:55.680 --> 36:57.360
She was of the devil, wasn't she?

36:58.240 --> 37:03.680
No, more than that.
She was the devil in disguise.

37:05.080 --> 37:08.320
-It is what he would do.
-Hmm.

37:13.680 --> 37:16.000
-Ale and women.
-And prayer.

37:16.080 --> 37:19.160
-Absolutely. But in that order.
-[both laughing]

37:32.520 --> 37:34.040
[knocking at door]

37:46.760 --> 37:49.840
If you object to me being here,
then say it.

37:52.120 --> 37:54.080
Let me see your face.

37:54.160 --> 37:55.760
-[Uhtred] Thyra.
-[gasps]

37:57.000 --> 37:58.120
Uhtred.

37:59.120 --> 38:00.720
[Uhtred] Inside. Inside.

38:05.920 --> 38:11.320
Uhtred. Uhtred, it is so good to see you,
to know that you are alive still.

38:11.400 --> 38:12.640
I am.

38:13.400 --> 38:14.880
Alive and well, at last.

38:15.600 --> 38:17.800
But why are you here? They will kill you.

38:19.120 --> 38:21.040
I came to see my children and you.

38:21.120 --> 38:25.560
They will kill you.
We would have come to you in Mercia.

38:25.640 --> 38:29.160
And I came to help Ragnar, to save Ragnar.

38:29.960 --> 38:32.120
He is dead. Beocca has told me--

38:32.200 --> 38:33.360
-Yes, yes--
-He is dead.

38:33.440 --> 38:36.240
He is dead. He is dead.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

38:36.320 --> 38:38.040
[both breathing shakily]

38:38.120 --> 38:39.720
But he is trapped in Niflheim.

38:43.080 --> 38:45.760
-He did not die a warrior's death.
-[crying]

38:45.840 --> 38:47.640
That privilege was stolen from him.

38:53.120 --> 38:57.120
Thyra, only your blood can save him now.

39:00.640 --> 39:02.560
A cupful, not all of it.

39:02.640 --> 39:04.640
[laughing]

39:16.560 --> 39:17.840
[gasps]

39:35.840 --> 39:38.200
Why do you come to the door
armed with a knife?

39:39.840 --> 39:41.680
Who objects to you being here?

39:43.440 --> 39:48.520
There are people who feel I do not belong.
They see only a Dane.

39:50.280 --> 39:51.480
But you're Beocca's wife.

39:52.040 --> 39:53.720
It's because they are afraid.

39:55.840 --> 40:00.080
You are gone, Alfred is sickly
and warriors are gathering.

40:03.480 --> 40:06.440
Does Beocca know... of the knife?

40:11.040 --> 40:13.280
Beocca, he has work to do.

40:17.520 --> 40:19.800
[Finan] However,
there is one slight problem.

40:19.880 --> 40:23.080
-Osferth is a virgin.
-[Osferth] No, it's not true.

40:23.160 --> 40:24.360
[Finan] It's true!

40:24.440 --> 40:26.840
-You need to do it sometime!
-[all laughing]

40:26.920 --> 40:29.080
[Finan] Are you surprised
to see me, Father?

40:29.600 --> 40:30.920
Where is he?

40:31.000 --> 40:34.960
He was last seen with a witch at Coccham,
and I don't mean the Abbess Hild.

40:36.400 --> 40:38.040
Do you have a message for him?

40:38.120 --> 40:40.040
He knows that his children are safe?

40:40.120 --> 40:43.640
[Finan] He knows they were taken.
He was not best pleased.

40:46.880 --> 40:50.920
Is he here? You know
I will not summon the guards. Is he here?

40:52.920 --> 40:53.760
He is.

40:55.000 --> 40:56.800
Now you can tell me why Aethelwold

40:56.880 --> 40:59.640
is walking the streets of Winchester
a free man.

40:59.720 --> 41:02.720
Because rightly or wrongly,
he has been forgiven,

41:03.560 --> 41:06.600
as I believe Uhtred will be forgiven.
Tell him to find me.

41:08.720 --> 41:12.520
Um, I think he may well
be sitting at your table, Father.

41:19.880 --> 41:23.680
Uhtred is here. I know it.
Are any of your men sober?

41:23.760 --> 41:26.040
Some. They are with the horses.

41:28.000 --> 41:31.560
We should pay a visit, you and I,
to Father Beocca's house.

41:35.080 --> 41:37.040
[doorknob rattles]

41:39.320 --> 41:40.480
[knocking at door]

41:40.560 --> 41:41.760
[doorknob rattles]

41:41.840 --> 41:45.840
-[Beocca] Thyra? Thyra, it's me, Beocca.
-One moment.

41:56.800 --> 42:00.200
You're bleeding.
Oh, good heavens, what have you done?

42:00.280 --> 42:01.760
No, I'm... I'm fine.

42:01.840 --> 42:04.680
You're bleeding. That should be wrapped.
Let me find something.

42:06.000 --> 42:10.440
Beocca, do not say a word, please.
Uhtred is here for good reason.

42:11.560 --> 42:13.520
"For good reason"? What reason?

42:15.720 --> 42:18.080
What is happening here?
What are you doing here?

42:18.160 --> 42:19.960
-[Thyra] Beocca.
-I'm talking to him.

42:20.040 --> 42:23.640
I am giving Uhtred my blood
to save Ragnar.

42:23.720 --> 42:24.920
It is true.

42:26.520 --> 42:28.560
It is paganism, is what it is.

42:29.520 --> 42:32.200
It is heathen, pagan,
unchristian nonsense.

42:32.280 --> 42:34.320
-You don't understand.
-I won't have it!

42:34.400 --> 42:36.280
-[Uhtred] Beocca!
-No, no.

42:37.160 --> 42:39.800
-Thyra, please.
-No, you will not interfere.

42:40.840 --> 42:41.720
It is wrong.

42:41.800 --> 42:44.680
If there's a chance for Ragnar
to find Valhalla,

42:44.760 --> 42:47.120
then I must offer that chance.

42:47.840 --> 42:49.480
I do not dismiss your god.

42:49.560 --> 42:51.120
Because my god is God!

42:51.200 --> 42:52.960
Ragnar is my blood.

42:54.360 --> 42:56.520
You will not dismiss
what my people believe.

42:57.080 --> 42:59.960
-Am I not your people?
-You are my husband.

43:01.040 --> 43:03.040
Which is why you must understand.

43:03.640 --> 43:05.600
[Uhtred] Beocca, we're almost done.

43:05.680 --> 43:08.960
-You will say nothing.
-We are almost done.

43:09.520 --> 43:12.800
Very well. Continue bleeding into a bowl.

43:12.880 --> 43:17.160
I will wait outside.
I do not care to witness this.

43:24.480 --> 43:25.680
You are certain of this?

43:25.760 --> 43:27.160
He is here, trust me.

43:27.240 --> 43:29.200
And Beocca, what do we do with him?

43:29.280 --> 43:32.400
He is protecting an outlaw.
Alfred can decide.

43:35.360 --> 43:36.760
[Sihtric] Go. Go!

43:45.480 --> 43:51.200
As I'm allowing you to practice
your misguided pagan rituals in my home...

43:53.120 --> 43:55.040
I would ask a favor in return.

43:55.960 --> 43:56.880
Ask.

43:58.960 --> 44:02.880
I would like you to speak with Alfred,
if I can arrange it safely.

44:04.080 --> 44:06.120
What makes you think he'd speak with me?

44:07.080 --> 44:10.040
Because death is near
and there are things unsaid.

44:14.640 --> 44:19.920
[Pyrlig] If it is not the disgraced,
yet forgiven Lord Aethelwold, sword drawn.

44:20.880 --> 44:23.080
You have stopped, I see,
outside this house.

44:23.160 --> 44:25.320
[Aethelwold] You should show some respect.

44:25.400 --> 44:28.240
-When you've earned it.
-There's an outlaw walking free.

44:28.320 --> 44:30.840
An outlaw? Who?

44:30.920 --> 44:34.320
-It is not your place to ask.
-You're no one to tell me of my place.

44:38.200 --> 44:41.440
[Pyrlig] Father Beocca! Father Beocca!

44:47.640 --> 44:48.480
What is this?

44:48.560 --> 44:50.680
I believe you have angry visitors.

44:50.760 --> 44:52.480
Surround the house. Do it now.

44:52.560 --> 44:55.880
-Surround the house? Whatever for?
-They're looking for an outlaw.

44:55.960 --> 44:59.640
I would like to look inside, Father.
I mean you no harm.

44:59.720 --> 45:01.360
It is for Alfred and Edward.

45:01.440 --> 45:03.680
What do you expect to find,
beside my wife?

45:03.760 --> 45:06.240
-Step aside, Father.
-I will not.

45:06.320 --> 45:07.480
We will not.

45:08.640 --> 45:09.880
You're hiding something.

45:09.960 --> 45:12.280
-With which eye are you looking, boy?
-[laughs]

45:12.360 --> 45:15.520
-Father, I swear, we mean no harm.
-This is my home.

45:15.600 --> 45:19.320
My home! And no man shall enter
without my permission.

45:19.400 --> 45:21.320
A problem we can help resolve here?

45:21.400 --> 45:25.800
It is a minor disagreement, that is all,
involving a minor ealdorman.

45:25.880 --> 45:28.000
Send for Steapa and the king's guard.

45:28.080 --> 45:30.680
Tell him we have all but captured
Uhtred Ragnarson.

45:30.760 --> 45:33.240
-Lord.
-You believe Uhtred is inside my house?

45:33.800 --> 45:36.200
-I do.
-You are ever the fool.

45:37.720 --> 45:38.720
[Thyra] Beocca?

45:41.160 --> 45:42.360
Stay inside, my dear.

45:42.440 --> 45:44.160
Beocca, I have been listening.

45:45.360 --> 45:49.400
If these men wish to look inside our home,
then we should allow it.

45:49.800 --> 45:51.880
We have nothing to hide, nothing at all.

45:53.120 --> 45:56.040
Please, come inside, Aethelwold.

45:59.440 --> 46:00.280
[Finan] Come on.

46:33.640 --> 46:35.240
[Beocca] Are you satisfied?

46:36.880 --> 46:39.520
I asked, are you satisfied?

46:41.720 --> 46:45.840
You have my sincere apologies,
Father, Lady.

46:47.120 --> 46:50.000
He was here. I can smell him.

46:51.920 --> 46:53.080
[floorboards creak]

46:53.160 --> 46:55.600
Will we see you at the wedding, Lords?

47:09.440 --> 47:11.000
Where in God's name is he?

47:16.920 --> 47:18.920
[indistinct chatter]

47:28.640 --> 47:33.960
[Alfred] I will leave the wedding feast
not because I am tired or unwell,

47:35.280 --> 47:37.000
but because there is work to do.

47:37.440 --> 47:38.440
[Beocca] Yes, Lord.

47:39.520 --> 47:41.520
I will not stay long after the songs.

47:43.400 --> 47:44.240
Is that wrong?

47:46.040 --> 47:46.880
No, Lord.

47:51.040 --> 47:53.760
Father Beocca,
something is troubling you. Say it.

47:59.280 --> 48:00.760
-Leave us.
-[man] Yes, Lord.

48:03.560 --> 48:04.720
[Beocca] Lord...

48:06.320 --> 48:09.520
today is about hope and stability,

48:10.440 --> 48:12.160
which is what Wessex needs.

48:14.200 --> 48:17.440
But the fear must be halted, despatched.

48:17.520 --> 48:19.000
-"Fear"?
-Yes, Lord.

48:20.200 --> 48:22.400
It exists in every man and woman.

48:24.120 --> 48:25.960
My own wife has dug out a hiding hole.

48:27.040 --> 48:28.240
In fear of her life.

48:30.440 --> 48:32.200
She has been threatened by who?

48:33.320 --> 48:37.920
By people who themselves are afraid
of life without their king.

48:40.640 --> 48:42.920
And Edward alone is not the answer.

48:44.800 --> 48:46.480
You know this yourself, Lord.

48:47.680 --> 48:52.640
Which is why you hope and pray, perhaps,
that Uhtred will return.

48:56.280 --> 48:59.480
If that is the case, Lord,
then your prayers have been answered.

49:00.240 --> 49:01.160
He is here.

49:04.040 --> 49:05.960
You can have him found and executed...

49:07.960 --> 49:09.320
or you can speak with him.

50:02.160 --> 50:05.800
You should wait here.
The king will be with you soon enough.
