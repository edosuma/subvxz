15:45.111 --> 15:48.448
Uh, don't worry.

15:45.111 --> 15:48.448
No more potty training today.

15:48.489 --> 15:51.534
All I really want

15:48.489 --> 15:51.534
is for you to be happy.

15:51.576 --> 15:53.411
Get good grades

15:53.453 --> 15:55.162
and get into

15:53.453 --> 15:55.162
an Ivy League college.

15:56.581 --> 15:58.291
Of course,

15:56.581 --> 15:58.291
most major universities

15:58.332 --> 16:00.042
do want you

15:58.332 --> 16:00.042
to be potty trained.

16:01.419 --> 16:03.379
Give me a kiss.

16:03.421 --> 16:04.923
<i>Aw!</i>

16:05.799 --> 16:09.260
Daddy? Look what D.J. did.

16:09.302 --> 16:11.304
Did it

16:09.302 --> 16:11.304
for your own good.

16:12.889 --> 16:15.349
Boy, are you gonna get it.

16:15.391 --> 16:17.017
Okay, daddy, ready?

16:17.059 --> 16:19.562
On your mark,

16:17.059 --> 16:19.562
get set, punish.

16:21.731 --> 16:23.608
Dad, she's always

16:21.731 --> 16:23.608
messing with my stuff.

16:23.650 --> 16:25.443
I had to teach her

16:23.650 --> 16:25.443
a lesson.

16:26.402 --> 16:28.696
I'll take it from here, okay?

16:28.738 --> 16:32.199
Stephanie, honey, you know

16:28.738 --> 16:32.199
that we need to treat

16:32.241 --> 16:34.535
each others property

16:32.241 --> 16:34.535
with respect.

16:34.577 --> 16:36.329
And D.J., in this family

16:36.370 --> 16:39.123
we do not tie together

16:36.370 --> 16:39.123
each others shoes.

16:39.165 --> 16:41.250
Unless there's some kind

16:39.165 --> 16:41.250
of weird emergency.

16:42.710 --> 16:43.711
- Okay.

16:42.710 --> 16:43.711
- Sure.

16:43.753 --> 16:44.921
Red light.

16:45.964 --> 16:47.882
What's our rule

16:45.964 --> 16:47.882
after we fight?

16:47.924 --> 16:51.218
- Never walk away angry.

16:51.260 --> 16:54.848
Very good.

16:51.260 --> 16:54.848
Now, go ahead and apologize.

16:57.057 --> 16:58.559
- Sorry.

17:00.144 --> 17:02.897
Now, D.J., help Stephanie

17:00.144 --> 17:02.897
untie her shoes.

17:02.939 --> 17:04.398
Poo-poo.

17:04.858 --> 17:06.108
Poo-poo?

17:06.818 --> 17:08.736
Oh, Michelle.

17:10.029 --> 17:11.614
Oh, I'll tell you what.

17:11.656 --> 17:14.617
Why don't we, uh,

17:11.656 --> 17:14.617
just mosey on upstairs

17:14.659 --> 17:16.703
and, uh, you know,

17:14.659 --> 17:16.703
just sit down

17:16.744 --> 17:18.078
maybe on the potty?

17:18.120 --> 17:19.622
And, uh, we'll thumb through

17:19.664 --> 17:21.123
some college catalogues.

17:23.793 --> 17:25.962
Okay, D.J.,

17:23.793 --> 17:25.962
you heard the man.

17:26.004 --> 17:28.255
Untie my shoes.

17:28.297 --> 17:30.591
The man said,

17:28.297 --> 17:30.591
"Help untie her shoes".

17:30.633 --> 17:31.843
Here's some help.

17:31.885 --> 17:33.970
Start with

17:31.885 --> 17:33.970
the little white sneaker.

17:34.012 --> 17:35.805
You have to untie them too.

17:35.847 --> 17:38.016
- No, I don't.

17:35.847 --> 17:38.016
- Yes, you do.

17:38.057 --> 17:39.934
- No, I don't.

17:38.057 --> 17:39.934
- Yes, you do.

17:39.976 --> 17:41.477
- No, I don't.

17:39.976 --> 17:41.477
- Yes, you do.

17:41.519 --> 17:43.145
- No, I didn't.

17:41.519 --> 17:43.145
- Yes, you did.

17:43.187 --> 17:45.105
- No, I didn't.

17:43.187 --> 17:45.105
- Yes, you did

17:45.147 --> 17:47.608
- No, I didn't.

17:45.147 --> 17:47.608
- Yes, you did

17:51.529 --> 17:53.614
- Yes, you did.

17:51.529 --> 17:53.614
- No, I didn't.

17:54.448 --> 17:56.200
See, what you've started?

18:00.830 --> 18:02.790
Why do I get

18:00.830 --> 18:02.790
all the blame for this, huh?

18:02.832 --> 18:05.459
They said, "Thank you very much,

18:02.832 --> 18:05.459
but we're going another way".

18:05.501 --> 18:07.045
Which is advertising

18:05.501 --> 18:07.045
lingo for

18:07.086 --> 18:09.255
"Put your puppet

18:07.086 --> 18:09.255
where the sun don't shine."

18:10.590 --> 18:12.717
I took a risk.

18:10.590 --> 18:12.717
I dared to be silly.

18:12.759 --> 18:14.761
Why didn't you tell me

18:12.759 --> 18:14.761
before you dared to be silly?

18:14.802 --> 18:16.554
Man, you promised me.

18:16.596 --> 18:19.057
I kept my promise.

18:16.596 --> 18:19.057
I did not wear a cat suit.

18:19.098 --> 18:21.893
You wore a cat suit

18:19.098 --> 18:21.893
on your hand.

18:21.935 --> 18:23.352
And you stabbed me

18:21.935 --> 18:23.352
in the back with it.

18:24.520 --> 18:26.689
Jess, this is not

18:24.520 --> 18:26.689
that big a deal.

18:26.731 --> 18:27.941
You're not really mad at me.

18:27.982 --> 18:29.567
There's something else

18:27.982 --> 18:29.567
bothering you.

18:29.609 --> 18:31.986
So, what is your problem?

18:29.609 --> 18:31.986
Really?

18:32.028 --> 18:34.405
My problem is, I'm living

18:32.028 --> 18:34.405
in the same house with you.

18:34.447 --> 18:35.782
Jess, what does that

18:34.447 --> 18:35.782
supposed to mean?

18:35.823 --> 18:37.324
Maybe, it means,

18:35.823 --> 18:37.324
we don't need three fathers.

18:37.366 --> 18:38.952
Haven't you seen that show

18:37.366 --> 18:38.952
"My Two Dads"?

18:38.993 --> 18:41.537
Two is all you need.

18:41.579 --> 18:43.372
- Alright, fine with me.

18:41.579 --> 18:43.372
- Fine with me.

18:43.414 --> 18:44.624
- Fine.

18:44.665 --> 18:45.750
- Fine.

18:45.792 --> 18:47.293
This is ridiculous.

18:56.302 --> 18:59.639
D.J., they sound really mad.

18:59.680 --> 19:01.390
Are they gonna get a divorce?

19:03.059 --> 19:05.269
Not if we make 'em

19:03.059 --> 19:05.269
to make up.

19:05.311 --> 19:07.396
You get Uncle Jesse

19:05.311 --> 19:07.396
and I'll get Joey.

19:07.438 --> 19:09.148
We'll all meet

19:07.438 --> 19:09.148
back in our room.

19:09.189 --> 19:11.109
You have a great mind, D.J.

19:12.401 --> 19:14.946
If you could

19:12.401 --> 19:14.946
only use it for good.

19:19.826 --> 19:21.869
Stephanie, I'm sure there's

19:19.826 --> 19:21.869
no monsters in your closet.

19:21.911 --> 19:23.162
But I'll check for it.

19:23.203 --> 19:25.498
I don't believe

19:23.203 --> 19:25.498
you broke a window.

19:25.539 --> 19:28.250
I don't believe it,

19:25.539 --> 19:28.250
'cause it's not broken.

19:29.418 --> 19:33.006
Well, well, well,

19:29.418 --> 19:33.006
look who's here.

19:33.047 --> 19:34.841
Well, well, well,

19:33.047 --> 19:34.841
look who's leaving.

19:34.882 --> 19:37.551
- I'm outta here.

19:34.882 --> 19:37.551
- Red light.

19:37.593 --> 19:39.345
We have a rule

19:37.593 --> 19:39.345
in this house.

19:39.386 --> 19:41.263
Never walk away angry.

19:42.306 --> 19:44.934
So, say you're sorry

19:42.306 --> 19:44.934
to each other.

19:44.976 --> 19:47.269
Please.

19:47.311 --> 19:49.355
- Sorry.

19:49.396 --> 19:51.774
That was pathetic.

19:51.816 --> 19:53.526
[knock on door]

19:53.567 --> 19:54.819
I don't wanna

19:53.567 --> 19:54.819
get anybody's hopes up

19:54.861 --> 19:56.445
but I think Michelle

19:54.861 --> 19:56.445
is on the verge

19:56.487 --> 19:58.072
of a major breakthrough.

19:58.114 --> 19:59.532
[bells ringing]

19:59.573 --> 20:01.367
Oh, my God.

19:59.573 --> 20:01.367
We're missing it.

20:07.289 --> 20:09.291
[laughing]

20:10.751 --> 20:13.253
Michelle, we did it.

20:13.295 --> 20:14.714
That's my big girl.

20:14.755 --> 20:16.340
(all)

20:14.755 --> 20:16.340
Yeah.

20:16.382 --> 20:17.675
Alright, Michelle.

20:17.717 --> 20:20.302
You're one step closer

20:17.717 --> 20:20.302
to a diaper free world.

20:20.344 --> 20:21.762
Come on, little mouse,

20:20.344 --> 20:21.762
I'll get you ready

20:21.804 --> 20:23.597
and we'll all go out

20:21.804 --> 20:23.597
and celebrate.

20:23.639 --> 20:26.308
[laughing]

20:26.350 --> 20:28.394
Dear little

20:26.350 --> 20:28.394
pumpkin sucker.

20:28.435 --> 20:30.897
Jesse, you're with that magazine

20:28.435 --> 20:30.897
was that too cute or what?

20:30.938 --> 20:33.232
[laughing]

20:33.273 --> 20:35.151
Does this mean you're

20:33.273 --> 20:35.151
not getting a divorce?

20:37.195 --> 20:39.363
A divorce?

20:37.195 --> 20:39.363
What are you talkin' about?

20:39.405 --> 20:42.825
You said there were

20:39.405 --> 20:42.825
too many dads here.

20:42.867 --> 20:45.036
You guys heard

20:42.867 --> 20:45.036
us fighting, huh?

20:45.078 --> 20:47.080
We don't want

20:45.078 --> 20:47.080
anybody to leave.

20:48.288 --> 20:50.208
- Uh, we need to talk.

20:48.288 --> 20:50.208
- Right.

20:51.625 --> 20:53.002
Come on.

20:51.625 --> 20:53.002
Let's sit down.

20:55.421 --> 20:58.716
Girls, nobody

20:55.421 --> 20:58.716
is leaving this house.

20:58.758 --> 21:00.551
Right. We just

20:58.758 --> 21:00.551
had a little fight.

21:02.887 --> 21:06.182
You see, sometimes

21:02.887 --> 21:06.182
in the heat of the moment you

21:06.224 --> 21:08.935
say things that

21:06.224 --> 21:08.935
you don't really mean.

21:08.976 --> 21:11.229
You know what I'm talkin' about.

21:08.976 --> 21:11.229
You guys fight all the time.

21:11.270 --> 21:13.689
We're sisters.

21:11.270 --> 21:13.689
We're supposed to fight.

21:13.731 --> 21:15.191
It's our job.

21:16.525 --> 21:19.319
Well, same with us.

21:16.525 --> 21:19.319
We fight like brothers.

21:20.905 --> 21:23.490
You mean that, Jess?

21:20.905 --> 21:23.490
You think of me like a brother?

21:23.532 --> 21:26.869
Well, you definitely,

21:23.532 --> 21:26.869
you irritate me like a brother.

21:26.911 --> 21:29.705
Jess, that's the nicest thing

21:26.911 --> 21:29.705
you've ever said to me.

21:31.707 --> 21:34.710
Oh, we helped raise

21:31.707 --> 21:34.710
these kids together.

21:34.752 --> 21:37.713
We do the laundry together,

21:34.752 --> 21:37.713
we make school lunch together.

21:37.755 --> 21:40.258
Somewhere along the line

21:37.755 --> 21:40.258
we became brothers.

21:40.299 --> 21:41.425
And housewives.

21:41.467 --> 21:42.969
[chuckles]

21:44.428 --> 21:46.597
Hey, I'm sorry about springing

21:44.428 --> 21:46.597
that puppet on you.

21:46.639 --> 21:50.017
I thought it would be a big hit.

21:46.639 --> 21:50.017
I was trying to surprise you.

21:50.059 --> 21:52.145
I guess, I should've

21:50.059 --> 21:52.145
talked to you about it first.

21:52.186 --> 21:53.646
Uh, it was cute.

21:55.231 --> 21:58.317
Uh, I'm sorry

21:55.231 --> 21:58.317
for getting crazy, Joey.

22:00.153 --> 22:02.947
Joey, you know

22:00.153 --> 22:02.947
that thing you said about

22:02.989 --> 22:05.950
something else

22:02.989 --> 22:05.950
was botherin' me.

22:05.992 --> 22:07.493
You're right.

22:09.453 --> 22:11.580
I'm scared.

22:11.622 --> 22:14.292
- You're scared?

22:11.622 --> 22:14.292
- Scared of what?

22:14.333 --> 22:16.376
Scared of not makin' it.

22:16.418 --> 22:18.671
You don't know, how hard it was

22:16.418 --> 22:18.671
to break away from my father

22:18.712 --> 22:21.174
leave the family business.

22:21.215 --> 22:25.219
The thought of me...crawling

22:21.215 --> 22:25.219
back, killin' bugs again.

22:27.263 --> 22:28.931
Admitting that I failed.

22:31.309 --> 22:34.312
I just don't know,

22:31.309 --> 22:34.312
if I'm good enough.

22:34.352 --> 22:36.354
Jess, no one ever knows.

22:36.396 --> 22:38.816
I go through that same fear

22:36.396 --> 22:38.816
every time I jump up on stage

22:38.858 --> 22:40.776
and try and make people laugh.

22:40.818 --> 22:44.113
Hey, but you gotta hang tough.

22:40.818 --> 22:44.113
You got a real talent.

22:44.155 --> 22:46.448
If it makes it

22:44.155 --> 22:46.448
any easier for you.

22:46.490 --> 22:48.909
Hey, we've all

22:46.490 --> 22:48.909
got faith in you.

22:48.951 --> 22:51.954
"Fred's Tire Town"

22:48.951 --> 22:51.954
is my favorite song.

22:51.996 --> 22:54.915
We're gonna sing it

22:51.996 --> 22:54.915
at graduation.

22:54.957 --> 22:56.625
Well, I'm gonna ask.

22:59.419 --> 23:02.340
Thank you, guys.

22:59.419 --> 23:02.340
That makes me feel a lot better.

23:04.466 --> 23:06.135
You know, Joseph, uh..
