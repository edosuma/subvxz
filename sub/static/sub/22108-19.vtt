Here she comes. It's go time.

00:40.374 --> 00:41.909
One, two, three.

00:41.942 --> 00:43.877
Happy Mother's Day!

00:43.911 --> 00:46.046
-Aw.
-We made you a card.

00:46.080 --> 00:48.516
It has a picture of you
giving birth to all of us,

00:48.549 --> 00:50.418
and you're saying,
"Ow-chi-wah-wah!"

00:50.451 --> 00:53.121
Ooh. It's so graphic,
but I love it.

00:53.154 --> 00:55.756
Happy Mother's Day, Lin.
I snuck out early this morning

00:55.789 --> 00:57.458
and bought bacon and eggs
and berries,

00:57.491 --> 01:00.361
and I was gonna make a special
Mother's Day breakfast.

01:00.394 --> 01:02.963
But I didn't get started yet
'cause I went to the bathroom,

01:02.996 --> 01:05.132
and it took, um,
it took a long time.

01:05.166 --> 01:09.403
Aw, that's really sweet,
but I've actually got

01:09.437 --> 01:12.072
a little Mother's Day idea.
(clears throat)

01:12.106 --> 01:16.310
Today, all of you have to say
yes to me, no matter what,

01:16.344 --> 01:19.113
because on this Mother's Day,
I am all-powerful,

01:19.147 --> 01:20.881
I am mom-nipotent!

01:20.914 --> 01:23.284
That's hot. I like a mom
who takes control.

01:23.317 --> 01:25.953
What if you snap and ask us
to murder somebody?

01:25.986 --> 01:27.788
You'd have to do it,
'cause it's Mother's Day.

01:27.821 --> 01:29.390
-LOUISE: Hmm.
-Okay, Your Momnipotency,

01:29.423 --> 01:31.425
uh, what do you want
to do today?

01:31.459 --> 01:34.061
Well, Ginger was telling me
about the open houses

01:34.094 --> 01:35.463
on Kingshead Island.

01:35.496 --> 01:36.997
Not only do you get
to walk through

01:37.030 --> 01:38.599
beautiful homes for sale,

01:38.632 --> 01:41.169
apparently, the realtors
put out amazing finger food.

01:41.202 --> 01:43.571
-Go on.
-It's all free.

01:43.604 --> 01:46.240
We'll act rich, we'll take
the tours, and we'll eat our way

01:46.274 --> 01:49.310
-around Kingshead Island.
-(sighs) I-I don't know.

01:49.343 --> 01:50.611
And you have to say yes
'cause it's Mother's Day,

01:50.644 --> 01:51.845
and I'm mom-nipotent.

01:51.879 --> 01:53.447
Isn't it wrong
to pretend we're buying a house

01:53.481 --> 01:55.149
to eat free food
that isn't for us?

01:55.183 --> 01:57.351
Don't worry, these richy riches
can afford to feed us.

01:57.385 --> 01:59.620
Oh, but before we leave,
all of you have to bathe,

01:59.653 --> 02:01.189
'cause you all look
a little gross.

02:01.222 --> 02:03.957
But I love you.
Happy Mother's Day!

02:03.991 --> 02:05.626
(seagulls chirping)

02:05.659 --> 02:07.528
So, uh, none of you
wanted to dress up

02:07.561 --> 02:09.297
to do the whole
rich family thing?

02:09.330 --> 02:12.132
-I changed my walk. Look.
-Damn.

02:12.166 --> 02:14.034
Uh, well, I'm gonna
go buy a snack.

02:14.067 --> 02:17.305
-Watch my walk.
-Oh, he looks so tired.

02:17.338 --> 02:20.841
-Hmm. Kind of hard to open, huh?
-Lot of plastic wrap.

02:20.874 --> 02:23.511
It's like they don't want us
to get to the muffin.

02:23.544 --> 02:26.380
-But we're gonna, aren't we?
-Yeah. Yeah, we are, eventually.

02:26.414 --> 02:28.048
Are you going
to Kingshead Island?

02:28.081 --> 02:29.850
Yeah. I'm going
to my mother's house.

02:29.883 --> 02:32.653
-Do you live on Kingshead?
-Oh, God, no. We're poor.

02:32.686 --> 02:35.189
We're just gonna go for the day
to check out open houses.

02:35.223 --> 02:37.625
Wait, if y-you're poor, why
are you going to open houses?

02:37.658 --> 02:39.227
Oh, 'cause my wife is forcing us

02:39.260 --> 02:41.462
to go and eat
the free food they give out.

02:41.495 --> 02:43.664
-Oh, so you mean lie.
-No, we're-we're just gonna

02:43.697 --> 02:45.633
pretend to be people
that are different from--

02:45.666 --> 02:47.067
Yeah, lie, lie.

02:47.100 --> 02:49.303
-We're gonna lie.
-(gasps) Hey, I did it!

02:49.337 --> 02:51.672
Ugh, I feel like I'm still
20 minutes away, but...

02:51.705 --> 02:53.241
You'll get there.

02:53.274 --> 02:55.309
LINDA:
Okay, remember:

02:55.343 --> 02:56.977
we're very rich,
we're here to buy a house,

02:57.010 --> 02:59.046
so when we get in there,
don't go right for the food.

02:59.079 --> 03:00.381
Just play it cool.

03:00.414 --> 03:02.049
Oh, my God, look at that spread!

03:02.082 --> 03:03.317
-Lin, calm down.
-Look at it!

03:03.351 --> 03:04.918
-Lin.
-Okay, you're right.

03:04.952 --> 03:06.654
I'll calm down.
I'm just gonna touch a shrimp.

03:06.687 --> 03:08.155
Oh, they're real.

03:08.188 --> 03:10.090
Wow, they have a downstairs
that's not a restaurant.

03:10.123 --> 03:11.892
Tina, get in character.

03:11.925 --> 03:13.527
So, now we've seen
the guest house.

03:13.561 --> 03:15.229
Where's the main house? Oh.
(chuckles)

03:15.263 --> 03:16.597
This is the main house?

03:16.630 --> 03:18.999
(laughs):
Oh, why, it's so cute.

03:19.032 --> 03:21.935
I think we should buy it as
a vacation home for my ferrets.

03:21.969 --> 03:23.571
Oh, okay, kids,
go upstairs, and, uh,

03:23.604 --> 03:25.005
you pick out your rooms.

03:25.038 --> 03:27.408
-I call dibs on the biggest one!
-Hell no! I'm the oldest!

03:27.441 --> 03:29.109
-LOUISE: Oh!
-(panting)

03:29.142 --> 03:31.044
LOUISE:
My room has its own bathroom!

03:31.078 --> 03:32.880
-GENE: Mine, too!
-TINA: So does mine!

03:32.913 --> 03:34.548
LOUISE:
Mine has a huge shower!

03:34.582 --> 03:36.550
TINA: Mine just has
a sink and a toilet.

03:36.584 --> 03:39.287
-A half bath?
-You disgust me!

03:39.320 --> 03:41.121
You know what's weird?
I think you might be

03:41.154 --> 03:42.856
-a little overdressed.
-Yeah, I know.

03:42.890 --> 03:45.125
All the rich ladies
are wearing yoga pants.

03:45.158 --> 03:46.760
Well, at least
I'm doing a great job

03:46.794 --> 03:48.562
acting like I'm not here
for the free food.

03:48.596 --> 03:50.698
Look how casual I am
when I eat this shrimp.

03:50.731 --> 03:52.232
(moans)

03:52.266 --> 03:53.734
Lin, you're moaning
when you chew.

03:53.767 --> 03:54.768
It's shrimp, Bob.

03:54.802 --> 03:56.304
(moaning)

03:56.337 --> 03:58.038
-Hi.
-Oh, God.

03:58.071 --> 03:59.740
-That's my wife. She's...
-Oh, ooh, one more.

03:59.773 --> 04:01.442
-One more. (exhales)
-She's eating shrimp.

04:01.475 --> 04:03.411
* Shrimp, shrimp,
shrimp and houses *

04:03.444 --> 04:05.479
* Shrimp, shrimp, shrimp
and houses *

04:05.513 --> 04:06.880
* Shrimp, shrimp,
shrimp and houses *

04:06.914 --> 04:09.049
* Open house, open house,
open houses *

04:09.082 --> 04:10.951
* Shrimp, shrimp,
shrimp and houses *

04:10.984 --> 04:12.753
* Shrimp, shrimp, shrimp
and houses *

04:12.786 --> 04:14.422
* Shrimp and houses! *

04:14.455 --> 04:16.223
Ah, I'm limp from shrimp.

04:16.255 --> 04:18.257
Well, this is it,
the last house.

04:19.993 --> 04:21.795
We're being watched.
Realtor at three o'clock.

04:21.829 --> 04:23.597
-That guy?
-No, that's nine o'clock.

04:23.631 --> 04:25.399
-That guy?
-No, that's Gene.

04:25.433 --> 04:27.000
-'Sup, girl?
-Uh, okay.

04:27.034 --> 04:28.336
Uh, kids,
go pick out your rooms.

04:28.369 --> 04:29.837
As you wish, Mother.

04:29.870 --> 04:31.839
Cute kids. Happy Mother's Day.

04:31.872 --> 04:33.774
Aw, thank you.

04:33.807 --> 04:36.777
I'm Julia. This is my listing.
Chocolate covered strawberry?

04:36.810 --> 04:39.480
Okay, I might have one.
Or four. (laughs)

04:39.513 --> 04:40.981
I love your dress.

04:41.014 --> 04:43.016
Some of these other ladies
should take a lesson from you.

04:43.050 --> 04:44.685
I know, right?
Yoga pants to an open house?

04:44.718 --> 04:46.354
-Come on.
-(laughs)

04:46.387 --> 04:48.422
They just come to snoop around
and eat the free food.

04:48.456 --> 04:50.324
-Can you believe that?
-What?!

04:50.358 --> 04:52.159
Ooh, clogs!
Let me guess. Are you a chef?

04:52.192 --> 04:53.427
Do you have a restaurant?

04:53.461 --> 04:55.496
-(chuckles) I-I do.
-Which one?

04:55.529 --> 04:58.499
Uh, it's, uh, a little,
out of the way bistro

04:58.532 --> 05:01.134
that serves f... uh, food.

05:01.168 --> 05:02.936
Mmm, that sounds good.

05:02.970 --> 05:05.706
Can I say something that might
seem a little out of bounds?

05:05.739 --> 05:07.541
Uh, sure.

05:07.575 --> 05:10.444
I don't know if you belong here.

05:10.478 --> 05:11.879
Uh, what-what do you mean?

05:11.912 --> 05:14.615
I think you're too interesting
for this house.

05:14.648 --> 05:16.617
(laughs):
Yeah.

05:16.650 --> 05:18.619
Oh, you're right, we are.

05:18.652 --> 05:21.522
I just got a new listing.
It could be a good fit for you.

05:21.555 --> 05:24.291
I can get you into
a private showing right now.

05:24.324 --> 05:26.326
-Oh, no, that's okay.
We got to go.
-I'm listening.

05:26.360 --> 05:29.630
It's a Victorian mansion.
Old school Kingshead.

05:29.663 --> 05:30.864
-Ooh.
-Lin.

05:30.898 --> 05:33.133
-Lots of character.
-Character.

05:33.166 --> 05:35.969
I should tell you, it does have
some "old house" issues.

05:36.003 --> 05:38.739
-Old house issues.
-Oh, my God.

05:38.772 --> 05:41.375
Lin, uh, quick talk, please,
uh, right now.

05:41.409 --> 05:42.676
A private showing
is very different

05:42.710 --> 05:44.478
from an open house, Lin.
Plus, I don't think

05:44.512 --> 05:46.046
we should waste
this realtor's time.

05:46.079 --> 05:48.348
What? She makes a ton of money
doing this stuff.

05:48.382 --> 05:50.418
Look, I'm mom-nipotent,
so say yes.

05:50.451 --> 05:53.053
-(sighs) Yes.
-All right!

05:53.086 --> 05:55.188
Let's go buy Mama a new house!

05:55.222 --> 05:57.658
Thanks for the ride.
We don't have our car.

05:57.691 --> 05:59.059
We took the boat here.

05:59.092 --> 06:00.561
Oh, you don't live on Kingshead?

06:00.594 --> 06:02.496
I mean, our boat.
Uh, we took our boat here,

06:02.530 --> 06:04.264
from our island--
uh, we have a little island.

06:04.297 --> 06:06.867
-It's nothing.
-Wow. Here we are.

06:06.900 --> 06:09.770
Okay, let me just clear
some stuff out of the backseat.

06:09.803 --> 06:12.372
(grunting)
Just this-- oh, God!

06:12.406 --> 06:14.374
These things are a pain
to get out. (chuckles)

06:14.408 --> 06:16.777
-(shouts)
-Oh, you're a mom.

06:16.810 --> 06:19.012
Uh, happy Mother's Day.

06:19.046 --> 06:20.548
Thanks. Yeah, I'm only 12 weeks

06:20.581 --> 06:22.382
into being a mom,
but I'm loving it.

06:22.416 --> 06:24.384
I'm also not sleeping,
my boobs hurt,

06:24.418 --> 06:26.286
-and I'm up to my neck in poop.
-Been there.

06:26.319 --> 06:28.922
Well, hop in. Let's go
check out your new home.

06:28.956 --> 06:32.192
So, uh, how long
you been selling houses for?

06:32.225 --> 06:34.361
Well, these are
my first two listings.

06:34.394 --> 06:37.230
We got pregnant, and I decided
it was time for a career change.

06:37.264 --> 06:38.866
And if I don't go broke
buying all that food

06:38.899 --> 06:40.367
for the open houses,
it'll be worth it.

06:40.400 --> 06:41.769
Oh, my goodness.

06:41.802 --> 06:43.370
Ooh, gas station.
Do you mind, real quick?

06:43.403 --> 06:44.505
I've been running on empty.

06:46.974 --> 06:48.642
Be right back.

06:48.676 --> 06:50.410
Oh, my God, Lin,
we-we can't go to this house.

06:50.444 --> 06:52.045
We need to leave, now.

06:52.079 --> 06:54.482
I'm really uncomfortable
with this situation.

06:54.515 --> 06:56.617
-And with Gene on my lap.
-You love it.

06:56.650 --> 06:58.285
LOUISE:
I've got Dad on my lap.

06:58.318 --> 06:59.920
Oh, sorry. There you are.

06:59.953 --> 07:01.722
This is awful.
She's so sweet and normal

07:01.755 --> 07:03.423
and a new mom,
and it's Mother's Day.

07:03.457 --> 07:05.125
Lin, let's just tell her
something came up,

07:05.158 --> 07:06.927
and we'll take
a cab to the ferry.

07:06.960 --> 07:08.829
-Yeah, yeah. Let's do that.
-Okay, I put in three bucks.

07:08.862 --> 07:10.097
That should get us there.

07:10.130 --> 07:11.799
Uh, hey, Julia,
so something, uh...

07:11.832 --> 07:13.667
You know, I actually thought
I might lose this listing

07:13.701 --> 07:16.236
'cause I only found one couple
to come look at the house.

07:16.269 --> 07:17.571
But now that I'm bringing you,

07:17.605 --> 07:19.573
I think everything
is gonna be okay.

07:19.607 --> 07:23.176
Oh, uh, well, let's go see
this house already, huh?

07:23.210 --> 07:25.779
(Tina groaning)

07:25.813 --> 07:28.248
JULIA: All right,
so the owner is also here.

07:28.281 --> 07:30.350
I called him before we left.
This was his mom's house,

07:30.383 --> 07:33.487
and he really wants to sell it
to a nice family, like you guys.

07:33.521 --> 07:35.823
Okay, let's just go in,
take the tour, and leave.

07:35.856 --> 07:37.357
Doesn't feel good lying to her,

07:37.390 --> 07:39.126
but at least
we won't get caught.

07:39.159 --> 07:40.828
Learning some strong lessons
from you today, Mom.

07:40.861 --> 07:42.429
Look, we shouldn't
be doing this,

07:42.462 --> 07:44.431
and your mom has made
some bad judgments today,

07:44.464 --> 07:46.299
but it-it'll be fine.

07:46.333 --> 07:49.302
Nobody knows we're poor people
who came over on the ferry.

07:52.973 --> 07:56.677
-Oh. Um... hi.
-Oh, my God.

08:00.313 --> 08:02.315
-Um, h-hello.
-Spencer,

08:02.349 --> 08:04.317
this is Bob,
Linda and their kids.

08:04.351 --> 08:06.820
Hi, Linda, kids, Bob.

08:06.854 --> 08:08.556
Spencer, so I, uh,
I feel like, uh...

08:08.589 --> 08:10.958
Bob, let me stop you
right there and say,

08:10.991 --> 08:13.460
it's nice to meet you,
for the first time.

08:13.493 --> 08:16.664
I-I agree.
I-It's also nice to meet you.

08:16.697 --> 08:19.232
-For the first time, as well.
-Huh?

08:19.266 --> 08:21.468
Oh. You guys are
good at talking.

08:21.501 --> 08:23.170
Shall we go inside?

08:23.203 --> 08:24.872
What the hell is going on?
You sound weird.

08:24.905 --> 08:26.206
You're gonna get us caught.

08:26.239 --> 08:27.808
Lin, I-I have
something to tell you.

08:27.841 --> 08:30.143
I met Spencer on the boat.
I told him everything.

08:30.177 --> 08:31.545
He knows what we're doing today.

08:31.579 --> 08:33.380
-He knows we're faking.
-What?!

08:33.413 --> 08:35.849
JULIA: Linda, come inside!
There's a whole house in here!

08:35.883 --> 08:37.517
Told you it had character.

08:37.551 --> 08:39.385
I've got to show you
the library.

08:39.419 --> 08:40.520
My Mom loves to read.

08:40.554 --> 08:42.054
-Mom, name two books.
-Shush.

08:42.089 --> 08:44.658
-Mom, can we go
pick out our rooms?
-Uh...

08:44.692 --> 08:47.695
You may absolutely pick out
any room on the second floor.

08:47.728 --> 08:49.429
But I'd like to ask
that you do not,

08:49.462 --> 08:51.899
and I repeat, do not
go up to the third floor.

08:51.932 --> 08:54.067
Okay, that was just a little
scary the way you said that.

08:54.101 --> 08:56.069
It's just, I'm remodeling
the third floor.

08:56.103 --> 08:57.504
It isn't safe.

08:57.537 --> 08:59.573
O-Okay, kids? You got that?
No third floor.

08:59.607 --> 09:01.008
Come, come.
Let's have a look-see.

09:01.041 --> 09:02.075
And maybe a purchase-y.

09:02.109 --> 09:03.777
What's going on?

09:03.811 --> 09:05.713
Why didn't you want Julia
to know we met?

09:05.746 --> 09:07.781
And why aren't you kicking us
out of your house?

09:07.815 --> 09:09.617
Oh, you mean because
you're faking being rich,

09:09.650 --> 09:12.385
going around, looking at houses,
wasting everybody's time?

09:12.419 --> 09:14.521
-Yes?
-Because I realized

09:14.554 --> 09:16.757
-I could actually use your help.
-Wait, what?

09:16.790 --> 09:18.626
There's another couple
coming to look at the house.

09:18.659 --> 09:20.293
They've been sniffing
at this listing for months.

09:20.327 --> 09:22.062
And what they need
is a little competition

09:22.095 --> 09:23.864
to get them to make an offer.

09:23.897 --> 09:25.766
And Julia doesn't need to know
you're lying liars.

09:25.799 --> 09:27.234
She seems like a good person.

09:27.267 --> 09:29.069
-Unlike you, Bob.
-Fair enough.

09:29.102 --> 09:31.571
But we're not really able
to buy a house?

09:31.605 --> 09:33.306
Just keep doing
what you're doing.

09:33.340 --> 09:37.044
-Help me unwrap this muffin.
-I never got mine unwrapped.

09:37.077 --> 09:38.879
But-but I know
what you're saying.

09:38.912 --> 09:41.548
-I smoked you fools!
-(panting) Damn it.

09:41.581 --> 09:43.784
(panting)
I am so full of crudités!

09:43.817 --> 09:45.452
TINA:
Oh, mine has a swing!

09:45.485 --> 09:47.788
LOUISE: Mine has a bathtub
in the middle of the room!

09:47.821 --> 09:49.589
GENE:
Mine has a swing in the bathtub!

09:49.623 --> 09:52.092
I don't know if it's a sex thing
or a disabled thing.

09:52.125 --> 09:53.894
Either way, it works!

09:53.927 --> 09:56.764
OLD WOMAN:
Leave!

09:56.797 --> 09:59.432
-Did you guys hear that?
-I hope not.

09:59.466 --> 10:00.834
I hope so.

10:00.868 --> 10:03.637
OLD WOMAN (growling):
Leave now!

10:03.671 --> 10:05.138
-(Gene and Tina scream)
-Whoa.

10:05.172 --> 10:07.407
It's a ghost.
This house is haunted!

10:07.440 --> 10:10.577
(slow footsteps)

10:10.610 --> 10:14.247
Wait, were those feet?
Ghosts don't have feet.

10:14.281 --> 10:16.116
I think we should go up there
and check it out.

10:16.149 --> 10:17.785
You mean up to the third floor?

10:17.818 --> 10:19.519
-It's off-limits.
-I know.

10:19.552 --> 10:21.822
And I feel really bad
about that, but we're going.

10:21.855 --> 10:25.458
I can't believe
my last meal was crudités!

10:25.492 --> 10:27.594
I can see this house
is winning you over!

10:27.627 --> 10:29.329
Do you think you're getting
close to making an offer?

10:29.362 --> 10:31.164
Do you want to call your bank?
Is that crazy?

10:31.198 --> 10:34.367
Uh, no, it's, uh,
it's not, uh, crazy.

10:34.401 --> 10:36.603
Uh, I can call them right now.

10:36.636 --> 10:39.606
1-800-BANK.

10:39.639 --> 10:42.309
Uh, hi, bank, it's Linda.

10:42.342 --> 10:44.444
Uh, yeah, it's Linda
with the money.

10:44.477 --> 10:47.715
Uh, how are interest rates?

10:47.748 --> 10:50.117
Oh, Julia, I can't do this.

10:50.150 --> 10:52.152
I got to tell you
something, sweetie.

10:52.185 --> 10:53.821
Hi, Lin, I just want
to interrupt real quick

10:53.854 --> 10:55.122
before you say any more words.

10:55.155 --> 10:56.957
Can I talk to you in the hall?

10:56.990 --> 10:58.525
So we keep acting interested
in the house,

10:58.558 --> 11:00.393
help push the other people
to make an offer,

11:00.427 --> 11:02.295
Julia never finds out
we're phonies,

11:02.329 --> 11:04.531
and she gets a commission on
the sale and everyone's happy?

11:04.564 --> 11:06.166
Yes. I mean,
I don't know about happy,

11:06.199 --> 11:07.667
but that's the plan.

11:07.701 --> 11:08.869
Oh, this is great.

11:08.902 --> 11:10.537
I already had
an amazing Mother's Day,

11:10.570 --> 11:12.372
and now it's time
to give Julia one.

11:12.405 --> 11:15.843
-We're heroes.
-Y... Yeah, sure.

11:15.876 --> 11:18.478
It's so murder-y up here.

11:18.511 --> 11:20.881
LOUISE:
He's definitely not remodeling.

11:20.914 --> 11:23.416
He's hiding something,
something horrible.

11:23.450 --> 11:25.252
-Tina, you go first.
-Wait, what?

11:25.285 --> 11:27.721
Well, fine, we'll all go
together, but with you in front.

11:27.755 --> 11:29.522
-Okay, that's fair.
-Mm-hmm.

11:29.556 --> 11:31.524
(Tina groans)

11:33.060 --> 11:34.361
(door creaks)

11:34.394 --> 11:36.596
TINA:
Oh, hell no.

11:36.629 --> 11:38.265
What is this?

11:38.298 --> 11:40.367
Maybe he's just a good dude
who opened a medical lab

11:40.400 --> 11:42.602
and is doing important
medical research?

11:44.137 --> 11:46.673
(all scream)

11:46.706 --> 11:49.276
Huh. This is incredible.

11:49.309 --> 11:51.678
The squirrels are all wearing
little costumes.

11:51.711 --> 11:53.546
"Professor Nutstein."

11:53.580 --> 11:55.682
This is terrifying.

11:55.715 --> 11:57.217
I've got a "Captain Nutstein"
over here.

11:57.250 --> 11:59.252
Look at this one.
"Pope Nutstein."

11:59.286 --> 12:01.454
Very accomplished family,
the Nutsteins.

12:01.488 --> 12:03.290
Leave!

12:03.323 --> 12:04.691
(all scream)

12:04.724 --> 12:06.593
Leave... (coughs) Lea...

12:06.626 --> 12:09.062
-(coughs) Tea.
-What?

12:09.096 --> 12:11.765
(coughs)
Tea. Tea. Fetch my tea.

12:11.799 --> 12:14.701
-It's on the table. (coughs)
-Here you go.

12:14.734 --> 12:16.804
Damn dust in this house.

12:16.837 --> 12:19.706
Wait, were you saying "leave"
in a really scary way on purpose

12:19.739 --> 12:21.274
or is that just how you talk?

12:21.308 --> 12:22.943
And are the squirrels
part of it?

12:22.976 --> 12:24.577
There's just a lot going on.

12:24.611 --> 12:26.947
Uh, yes, I was trying
to be scary.

12:26.980 --> 12:28.949
I was trying
to get you to leave.

12:28.982 --> 12:30.617
No, the squirrels
aren't part of it.

12:30.650 --> 12:32.119
That's just a thing I do.

12:32.152 --> 12:34.721
Follow-up question:
um, who are you?

12:34.754 --> 12:36.656
My name's Ethel. I live here.

12:36.689 --> 12:38.625
Where did you get
all these squirrels?

12:38.658 --> 12:40.994
From the house.
It's infested with them.

12:41.028 --> 12:43.430
You found all these
dead squirrels in your house?

12:43.463 --> 12:47.234
Yes. Let's say I found them
all dead, natural causes.

12:47.267 --> 12:48.468
So this is your house?

12:48.501 --> 12:50.003
I thought it was
Spencer's house.

12:50.037 --> 12:52.005
This is my house.
Spencer's my son.

12:52.039 --> 12:53.440
Aren't you trying to sell it?

12:53.473 --> 12:55.242
Why are you trying
to scare us away?

12:55.275 --> 12:57.410
I don't want to sell.
Spencer wants to sell.

12:57.444 --> 12:59.146
He's trying to push me
out of here.

12:59.179 --> 13:02.515
So every time he shows my house,
I try to scare away the buyers.

13:02.549 --> 13:04.417
By pretending to be a ghost?

13:04.451 --> 13:07.187
Mm-hmm. I've been spooking
the hell out of this place.

13:07.220 --> 13:08.688
That's badass, Ethel.

13:08.721 --> 13:10.824
I know.
I've rigged the whole house.

13:10.858 --> 13:12.625
I cut eyeholes in the paintings
and everything.

13:12.659 --> 13:14.427
And I've been saving
buckets of squirrel blood

13:14.461 --> 13:16.163
for the right moment.

13:16.196 --> 13:19.032
-(Tina gags)
-I've lived here
for over 60 years.

13:19.066 --> 13:22.035
I got married in this house.
I raised a kid in this house.

13:22.069 --> 13:23.636
I learned taxidermy
in this house.

13:23.670 --> 13:25.305
LOUISE:
Yeah, you did.

13:25.338 --> 13:28.175
Eventually Spencer moved away
and my husband passed.

13:28.208 --> 13:31.478
It was lonely at first,
but this place is still my home.

13:31.511 --> 13:33.046
That is so sad.

13:33.080 --> 13:34.882
Yeah, we thought
you guys should hear that.

13:34.915 --> 13:37.450
You're selling your
mother's house on Mother's Day?

13:37.484 --> 13:39.953
Okay, so now I know
why I got this listing

13:39.987 --> 13:42.155
and why it's been on the market
for so long.

13:42.189 --> 13:44.357
Your mother has been haunting
all the showings.

13:44.391 --> 13:46.793
Haunting and/or
just seeming really freaky.

13:46.826 --> 13:49.997
Oh, okay. So, uh, are we still
showing the house?

13:50.030 --> 13:50.998
-Yes.
-No.

13:51.031 --> 13:52.699
Yes, we are still showing.

13:52.732 --> 13:55.402
We have been over this, Mom.
You are moving in with me.

13:55.435 --> 13:58.205
Okay, good. Uh, Kyle and Claire
are gonna be here any minute.

13:58.238 --> 13:59.839
You know what, Julia?

13:59.873 --> 14:02.009
When Kyle and Claire get here,
I think it might be good

14:02.042 --> 14:03.376
if you tour everyone
around together.

14:03.410 --> 14:04.811
You know what I mean?

14:04.844 --> 14:07.047
Oh, okay. Get a little
competition going.

14:07.080 --> 14:09.249
Oh! They're here.

14:09.282 --> 14:11.318
Mom, please can I take you
back upstairs?

14:11.351 --> 14:12.652
So I can haunt?

14:12.685 --> 14:13.686
-No.
-Freak it?

14:13.720 --> 14:14.821
-No!
-Mm.

14:14.854 --> 14:16.323
Okay, you can do this.

14:16.356 --> 14:17.925
You are gonna
sell a house today.

14:17.958 --> 14:21.094
Oh, no. Torn between two mothers
on Mother's Day.

14:21.128 --> 14:22.762
Mamma mia.

14:26.366 --> 14:28.768
I can't believe you're selling
my house on Mother's Day.

14:28.801 --> 14:30.904
It was the only Sunday
we could do this.

14:30.938 --> 14:32.772
I got you that card
with the monkey on it

14:32.805 --> 14:34.441
that said,
"I'm bananas for you."

14:34.474 --> 14:37.044
-Then act like
you're bananas for me!
-(doorbell rings)

14:37.077 --> 14:39.612
I'll get it! There's an accent
I've been wanting to try out.

14:39.646 --> 14:41.614
No, kids,
go-go keep Ethel company.

14:41.648 --> 14:44.384
Fine. Team Ethel heading back
to the third floor.

14:44.417 --> 14:47.120
I don't know what to do.
I want to help Julia get a sale,

14:47.154 --> 14:49.422
but I don't want to be shady
to an old lady.

14:49.456 --> 14:52.092
I know. We shouldn't have
come here or done any of this.

14:52.125 --> 14:54.761
I just wanted to eat shrimp
and feel fancy on Mother's Day.

14:54.794 --> 14:56.229
What are we gonna do?

14:56.263 --> 14:58.365
Look, I think we just
have to keep up the act,

14:58.398 --> 15:00.033
try to get this other couple
to buy the house,

15:00.067 --> 15:01.468
and then get out of here.

15:01.501 --> 15:03.570
So keep up the act,
screw over an old lady,

15:03.603 --> 15:04.804
and try to sleep at night?

15:04.837 --> 15:06.539
I like the way I said it better,

15:06.573 --> 15:07.874
but yeah,
that's basically the plan.

15:07.907 --> 15:09.309
Oh, we're going to hell.

15:10.978 --> 15:12.946
Maybe there's another room
we could sit in,

15:12.980 --> 15:15.648
because I'm getting
a little naus... (gags)

15:15.682 --> 15:18.051
-Oh, God. Oh, my God.
-Whoa.

15:18.085 --> 15:20.988
Oh, what's the big deal?
It's like a Fruit Roll-Up.

15:21.021 --> 15:23.991
-You just ruined Fruit Roll-Ups!
-Just let me work.

15:24.024 --> 15:27.160
This might be the last one I
make before he sells this place.

15:27.194 --> 15:29.162
Wait, so you're giving up?
That's it?

15:29.196 --> 15:32.332
Is Spencer even gonna let you
bring all of these to his house?

15:32.365 --> 15:34.934
I'll probably donate them
to the children's hospital.

15:34.968 --> 15:36.936
No! Don't you do that
to those kids!

15:36.970 --> 15:39.172
I-I mean, cool, cool,
v-very cool.

15:39.206 --> 15:40.974
Seems sad if you've been saving

15:41.008 --> 15:42.642
all that squirrel blood
for nothing.

15:42.675 --> 15:45.612
-You feel me?
-I feel you.

15:45.645 --> 15:47.914
Kyle and Claire have been
e-mailing me a lot of questions,

15:47.947 --> 15:49.582
but this is
their first time up here.

15:49.616 --> 15:51.751
You've been circling
this property for a while,

15:51.784 --> 15:54.754
like hungry wolves
that don't ever actually attack.

15:54.787 --> 15:56.589
Oh, we're gonna attack.

15:56.623 --> 15:58.925
We watch the drone video of
the property, like, every night.

15:58.958 --> 16:01.494
You know what they say, drone it
till you own it. (chuckles)

16:01.528 --> 16:03.196
BOB:
Hmm, that's great, Kyle.

16:03.230 --> 16:04.864
That's-that's great
that you've seen that video.

16:04.897 --> 16:06.666
I have a computer, too.

16:06.699 --> 16:10.370
My wife called the bank already,
so loan it till you own it.

16:10.403 --> 16:11.871
Wait, you're not paying cash?

16:11.904 --> 16:13.606
That's gonna
slow things down for you.

16:13.640 --> 16:15.042
Oh, no, I meant I'm, uh,

16:15.075 --> 16:17.877
loaning money to the bank
to then pay me.

16:17.910 --> 16:19.946
You're loaning money
to the bank?

16:19.979 --> 16:23.016
One of us is kind of
embarrassing himself right now.

16:23.050 --> 16:25.185
We rattled them.
I think it's already working.

16:25.218 --> 16:26.786
I know.
This guy wants to fight me.

16:26.819 --> 16:27.987
(chuckles):
I love it.

16:28.021 --> 16:31.191
Ooh, water damage.
That wasn't in the photos.

16:31.224 --> 16:34.461
-"Water" we gonna do about that?
-I love that water damage.

16:34.494 --> 16:37.464
Don't you love it, Lin?
Lin, the water damage?

16:37.497 --> 16:41.401
Oh, yeah, it's, uh, great.
It's real, uh-- I love it.

16:41.434 --> 16:43.736
CLAIRE:
It's a little gusty out here.

16:43.770 --> 16:45.072
I love a little breeze.

16:45.105 --> 16:47.074
I could come out here
and, you know, fly my kite.

16:47.107 --> 16:48.841
I have a gold kite.
Do you, Kyle?

16:48.875 --> 16:50.410
Do you have a gold kite?
'Cause I do.

16:50.443 --> 16:52.412
We could get rid of
that old swing set, right?

16:52.445 --> 16:55.048
-Bit of an eyesore.
-Yeah, it was mine as a kid.

16:55.082 --> 16:57.717
-Poor kid.
-Aw, swing set.

16:57.750 --> 16:59.252
I love this room.

16:59.286 --> 17:01.554
It just needs a fresh coat
of Kyle and Claire.

17:01.588 --> 17:04.357
Or we blow out this wall,
blow out that wall,

17:04.391 --> 17:07.359
and put a fresh coat of Kyle's
sword collection right there.

17:07.394 --> 17:09.162
Did you say swords? (laughs)

17:09.195 --> 17:11.897
I-I remember when I used to be
into my sword collection.

17:11.931 --> 17:13.433
I-I'm into spears now.

17:13.465 --> 17:15.702
That's my family
in squirrel form.

17:15.734 --> 17:17.770
-I meant to hide that.
-Aw.

17:17.804 --> 17:19.038
SPENCER: My mother's first
squirrel-sterpiece.

17:19.071 --> 17:20.573
Her word, not mine.

17:20.607 --> 17:22.541
I think we've seen everything
we need to see.

17:22.575 --> 17:24.176
Linda, uh, let's make a move.

17:24.211 --> 17:26.713
It's gonna be a big move
into this house.

17:26.746 --> 17:28.615
-Oh.
-Babe, I think
we pull the trigger.

17:28.648 --> 17:30.217
-Should we just do it?
-You think we should do it?

17:30.250 --> 17:32.519
-I want to do it.
-I want to do it
if you want to do it.

17:32.552 --> 17:34.287
-Cock it? Pull it?
-Cock it and pull it.

17:34.321 --> 17:36.523
All right. Let's buy this place.

17:36.556 --> 17:38.691
No, stop!
Nobody should buy this house!

17:38.725 --> 17:39.692
-What?
-Huh?

17:39.726 --> 17:41.194
I can't do it anymore, Bob.

17:41.228 --> 17:42.629
We're not making an offer,
all right?

17:42.662 --> 17:43.930
We're not interested
in the house.

17:43.963 --> 17:45.265
We can barely afford
our apartment.

17:45.298 --> 17:47.033
Apartment? Gross.

17:47.066 --> 17:49.369
We're only acting interested
to get you to make an offer.

17:49.402 --> 17:51.037
We were just trying
to help Julia,

17:51.070 --> 17:52.872
but I think we're supposed
to be helping Ethel.

17:52.905 --> 17:54.307
Julia, I'm sorry.

17:54.341 --> 17:56.309
Who's Ethel?
Did you hire these people?

17:56.343 --> 17:58.545
Wait, are you trying to trick us
into buying this house?

17:58.578 --> 18:00.947
No, no.
I just met Bob and Linda.

18:00.980 --> 18:02.649
-Kyle high club?
-Claire-atin?

18:02.682 --> 18:04.784
Un-cock it, un-pull it.
We're going home.

18:04.817 --> 18:07.420
Please don't go.
Uh, re-re-cock it.

18:07.454 --> 18:10.423
-Mommy, Daddy, help!
-CLAIRE: What is happening?

18:10.457 --> 18:13.426
-Ghost! We saw a ghost!
-The damn house is haunted!

18:13.460 --> 18:15.061
ETHEL (growling):
Leave!

18:15.094 --> 18:17.264
(kids screaming)

18:17.297 --> 18:18.498
Person blood!

18:18.531 --> 18:22.269
Leave! (groaning)

18:22.302 --> 18:25.605
-Everyone was just leaving.
-Oh, good.

18:29.442 --> 18:31.244
(sobs) This would
probably be considered

18:31.278 --> 18:32.979
a very bad private showing.

18:33.012 --> 18:35.348
Full disclosure, this is
squirrel blood, not human.

18:35.382 --> 18:37.984
Um, but each squirrel
only bleeds a few ounces,

18:38.017 --> 18:39.819
so do the math.

18:39.852 --> 18:41.188
So many squirrels!

18:41.221 --> 18:42.489
She peels them
like Fruit Roll-Ups!

18:42.522 --> 18:44.524
Julia, I'm so sorry.

18:44.557 --> 18:46.025
I'm just a mother
who was looking

18:46.058 --> 18:48.795
to have a nice Mother's Day,
and things got out of control.

18:48.828 --> 18:51.464
Oh, cool, got it, thanks.
Great explanation.

18:51.498 --> 18:55.535
(groans) My hip is killing me.
It must be the weather.

18:55.568 --> 18:58.104
It's not the weather.
It's the stairs, Mom.

18:58.137 --> 19:00.106
This house has
too many stairs for you.

19:00.139 --> 19:02.008
You're so old.

19:02.041 --> 19:03.710
It's why I want her
to move in with me.

19:03.743 --> 19:05.845
Right, right. That makes sense.

19:05.878 --> 19:07.714
-Honey, let's go.
-I'm leaving, too.

19:07.747 --> 19:09.349
I'll find a new job.

19:09.382 --> 19:11.551
Maybe I'll be
a spine-o-cologist.

19:11.584 --> 19:13.886
-What's that?
-(crying): Isn't that what
they call spine doctors?

19:13.920 --> 19:16.323
I don't know.
I'll find out when I become one.

19:16.356 --> 19:18.691
She's gonna be okay.

19:18.725 --> 19:21.127
Wait, wait, don't go.
Let me say something.

19:21.160 --> 19:23.496
Spencer, I-I thought you were
being mean to your mom

19:23.530 --> 19:25.898
and you just wanted
to sell the house for money,

19:25.932 --> 19:27.567
but-but really
you were being sweet.

19:27.600 --> 19:29.569
You were just worried.
I get it.

19:29.602 --> 19:31.338
This house has, like,
600 freaking steps,

19:31.371 --> 19:33.005
and you're scared
she's gonna fall

19:33.039 --> 19:35.074
and end up looking like
how she looks right now,

19:35.107 --> 19:36.576
all bloody and gross.

19:36.609 --> 19:38.345
Yes, I am.
I'm scared of a lot of things.

19:38.378 --> 19:40.313
The house catching on fire

19:40.347 --> 19:43.149
-because of the exposed wires
in the basement...
-The what?

19:43.182 --> 19:45.084
-...and the lead in the pipes.
-Wait, what?
-Oh, my God.

19:45.117 --> 19:47.086
You should be worried
about the squirrels, bro.

19:47.119 --> 19:49.522
They are gonna rise up
and tear that lady apart!

19:49.556 --> 19:51.658
And-and you two,
you love this house

19:51.691 --> 19:54.026
and you were
about to make an offer on it.

19:54.060 --> 19:56.062
We were, but then
you made things super weird

19:56.095 --> 19:57.697
and tried to trick us.

19:57.730 --> 19:59.566
And Spencer just disclosed,
like, five other things

19:59.599 --> 20:02.569
-that are total deal breakers.
-I was kidding. (giggles)

20:02.602 --> 20:04.170
Look, we did tell a fib,

20:04.203 --> 20:06.105
and-and Spencer
did say some stuff,

20:06.138 --> 20:09.175
but that stuff's all fixable,
and that fib that we told

20:09.208 --> 20:10.677
got you guys to finally realize

20:10.710 --> 20:12.579
that this is
the right house for you.

20:12.612 --> 20:14.614
You're not gonna find
another place like this one.

20:14.647 --> 20:16.949
-This house is special.
-It is.

20:16.983 --> 20:19.752
I mean, we'd have to change
everything, but it is special.

20:19.786 --> 20:21.621
So you don't collect spears?

20:21.654 --> 20:24.624
-Um, I mean, no.
-I'm gonna do it, then.

20:24.657 --> 20:28.461
Ethel, listen to me, honey.
This place is just a house now.

20:28.495 --> 20:30.430
Your home is with your son.

20:30.463 --> 20:33.065
He wants you to move in
with him. He cares about you.

20:33.099 --> 20:35.902
Hmm. Spencer never said it
to me quite that way.

20:35.935 --> 20:37.937
He talked a lot about
me falling down stairs,

20:37.970 --> 20:40.407
but I could never tell
if he was pro or con.

20:40.440 --> 20:42.575
-I've been both.
-Oh, fine.

20:42.609 --> 20:44.277
I'll move in with you,
Spencey.

20:44.311 --> 20:45.878
Sell the damn house.

20:45.912 --> 20:47.914
Well, I'll let you take it
from here, Julia.

20:47.947 --> 20:50.216
So, do you guys
want to buy a house?

20:50.249 --> 20:53.453
-We're gonna need 50,000 off.
-And then another 50,000 off.

20:53.486 --> 20:54.887
-No.
-You got a deal.

20:54.921 --> 20:57.123
Oh, say yes, Spencer.
It's a good price.

20:57.156 --> 20:59.058
They don't even know
about the sinking.

20:59.091 --> 21:00.993
-The what?
-What?
-Nothing. Deal.

21:01.027 --> 21:03.596
-Fine.
-I just sold a house!
I sold a home!

21:03.630 --> 21:06.499
All right!
(sighs) I'm exhausted.

21:06.533 --> 21:08.234
I'm starving. Who's hungry?

21:08.267 --> 21:10.002
-Anyone want a Fruit Roll-Up?
-(Tina gags)

21:10.036 --> 21:11.638
-I make them myself.
-(Tina gags)

21:11.671 --> 21:13.906
-Jerky?
-We got to go. We got to go!

21:13.940 --> 21:16.609
LINDA:

21:16.643 --> 21:20.146

ain't nobody happy *

(vocalizing)

on Bob's Burgers.
