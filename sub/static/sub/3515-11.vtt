WEBVTT

00:04.160 --> 00:05.969
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

00:24.400 --> 00:25.686
(WINCES)

00:32.720 --> 00:35.291
So the house in
Southwest Hills...

00:35.440 --> 00:38.046
I sell them
a security system for $10,000.

00:38.120 --> 00:41.408
Wife calls me out there three times
this week. Can't figure out the system.

00:41.520 --> 00:43.488
So this last time,
she opens up the door.

00:43.560 --> 00:47.610
She's wearing nothing
but a poofy bathrobe.

00:47.680 --> 00:48.886
Okay.
So I'm saying to myself,

00:48.960 --> 00:51.122
"Wifey,
she's a little bit lonely.

00:51.200 --> 00:52.850
"I mean, this is
what this is all about."

00:52.920 --> 00:54.604
Just make sure
hubby doesn't walk in

00:54.720 --> 00:56.370
and find you tripping her alarm.

00:56.560 --> 00:59.769
(LAUGHS) I need to drop a bomb.

01:10.400 --> 01:11.640
Do I know you?

01:13.760 --> 01:16.889
Yeah, you know me.
You know me real well.

01:23.640 --> 01:24.687
What do you want?

01:24.840 --> 01:25.841
You don't know?

01:29.800 --> 01:31.404
I got nothing to say to you.

01:31.480 --> 01:33.289
You don't have to say it to me,

01:33.360 --> 01:36.284
but you are gonna have
to say it to somebody.

01:36.600 --> 01:37.931
What can I get for you, sweetie?

01:38.000 --> 01:40.685
She's not having anything.
She's leaving.

01:41.600 --> 01:43.090
Don't let me get in the way.

01:45.240 --> 01:48.562
I thought I'd be able to put
this behind me, but I can't.

01:48.640 --> 01:50.642
I don't know what
you're talking about.

01:52.960 --> 01:54.564
Maybe this will
help you remember.

02:00.520 --> 02:02.727
Now you won't forget.

02:04.320 --> 02:05.651
You're out of your mind.

02:05.720 --> 02:08.086
I'm not going away
until you admit what you did.

02:08.160 --> 02:09.446
You need help.

02:20.080 --> 02:24.961
"Life is the scale upon which is
measured the depth of a man's soul."

02:25.080 --> 02:26.286
Nice.

02:26.360 --> 02:28.124
Who said that?
I did, just now.

02:28.200 --> 02:30.282
You didn't recognize my voice?

02:30.360 --> 02:31.566
(LAUGHS)

02:34.960 --> 02:37.440
Have you seen my
mini fluted socket?

02:37.960 --> 02:40.327
No, I have not seen
your mini fluted socket.

02:41.480 --> 02:42.970
How about after I
finish this prescription

02:43.040 --> 02:45.202
for Mrs. Wurstner,
we go grab some Kung Pao?

02:45.280 --> 02:46.725
I'm starving.

02:50.120 --> 02:51.884
Did you get
a letter from your mom?

02:53.080 --> 02:54.081
Oh.

02:54.240 --> 02:56.641
Yeah.
That came a couple days ago.

02:57.440 --> 02:58.760
Isn't this
the first communication

02:58.840 --> 03:00.120
you've had with
your mother in...

03:00.200 --> 03:02.407
Seven years.

03:02.480 --> 03:03.766
Good news or bad?

03:03.920 --> 03:05.206
I don't know yet.

03:05.280 --> 03:07.720
She wants me to come down to
Medford and have dinner with her.

03:07.920 --> 03:08.921
Oh.

03:10.320 --> 03:11.446
You gonna go?

03:11.600 --> 03:12.681
I'm not sure.

03:14.200 --> 03:16.441
Do we know what she wants?

03:17.040 --> 03:19.168
This weekend is the
anniversary of my dad's death.

03:24.040 --> 03:27.965
Well, seems to me like she's
kind of reaching out to you.

03:34.320 --> 03:35.810
Will you come with me?

03:37.080 --> 03:38.320
Of course.

03:39.880 --> 03:41.530
You sure I won't be in the way?

03:42.840 --> 03:44.171
Might be a good thing.

03:44.360 --> 03:45.725
(CHUCKLES)

03:46.400 --> 03:49.165
So when? When do we do this?

03:49.800 --> 03:51.211
She wants me to come
down tomorrow night,

03:51.280 --> 03:53.760
so I guess I should tell her
that you are joining

03:53.840 --> 03:55.808
and that you're a vegetarian.

03:56.760 --> 04:00.321
I'm telling you, she's in Portland.
I just saw her at the hall!

04:02.280 --> 04:04.169
How the hell would I know that?

04:05.000 --> 04:08.891
(VEHICLE APPROACHING) I'm telling you,
she's crazy. She sliced up her arm.

04:10.880 --> 04:12.848
We're gonna have a problem.

04:12.920 --> 04:14.046
(DOOR OPENS)

04:14.120 --> 04:15.963
I got to call you back.

04:18.160 --> 04:20.083
Don't you want me anymore,
Sergeant?

04:20.160 --> 04:21.730
You got to be kidding me.

04:25.240 --> 04:26.241
Hey!

04:26.920 --> 04:29.082
Get the hell off my property!

04:32.360 --> 04:35.364
Come back here again, I'm
gonna throw your ass in jail.

04:35.440 --> 04:36.566
Move!

04:38.400 --> 04:40.243
What are you
gonna tell the police?

04:40.320 --> 04:41.970
You want to play games with me?

04:42.040 --> 04:43.041
Huh?

04:43.520 --> 04:45.170
You think you'll get
away with this crap?

04:45.720 --> 04:47.848
I'm never going away.

04:48.680 --> 04:50.125
The hell you aren't.

04:50.320 --> 04:54.530
I'm never going away.
I'm never going away!

05:14.560 --> 05:16.050
(FLOOR CREAKS)

05:31.600 --> 05:32.840
(GLASS BREAKS)

05:44.280 --> 05:45.645
Crazy bitch.

05:45.840 --> 05:47.126
(ROARING)

06:25.520 --> 06:27.966
(INDISTINCT CHATTER
OVER POLICE RADIO)

06:30.880 --> 06:31.961
Hey.

06:32.560 --> 06:35.530
Victim is Ron Hurd, homeowner
and senior sales associate

06:35.600 --> 06:36.931
from McCabe Security.

06:37.080 --> 06:38.411
Rent-a-cops for the rich.

06:38.480 --> 06:39.527
When he didn't show up for work,

06:39.600 --> 06:42.206
the company sent their rep,
Troy Dodge, to check on things.

06:42.280 --> 06:44.647
Door was unlocked,
no sign of a break-in.

06:44.720 --> 06:47.041
Mr. Dodge found the body
inside and called us.

06:47.120 --> 06:49.851
Guy in charge of home security
killed in his own home?

06:49.920 --> 06:51.729
Apparently he didn't
turn on his alarm.

06:52.000 --> 06:53.001
Oops.

06:53.320 --> 06:55.209
Center wound too big
for a bullet.

06:55.280 --> 06:56.930
Bullet that big would have
gone through his body

06:57.000 --> 06:58.764
and through the wall.
Too round for a blade.

06:59.960 --> 07:01.530
It doesn't appear
to have been fired,

07:01.600 --> 07:03.250
but he was ready for somebody.

07:03.400 --> 07:05.050
Yeah, not ready enough.

07:07.920 --> 07:09.331
A medal box.

07:09.400 --> 07:11.280
When a soldier gets discharged
from the service,

07:11.320 --> 07:13.243
you get your medals
and badges framed.

07:13.320 --> 07:14.320
How do you know that?

07:14.360 --> 07:16.362
My father was in the service.

07:16.440 --> 07:18.568
Big Red One, 1st Infantry.

07:18.920 --> 07:20.843
Bronze star, silver star.

07:20.960 --> 07:23.770
So why would someone want to kill
our victim for his war medals?

07:23.880 --> 07:26.247
No idea.
Ron was a good man.

07:26.320 --> 07:28.687
I worked with him at
the company since 2011.

07:28.840 --> 07:30.046
Before that, we were in Iraq.

07:30.200 --> 07:31.406
You were in the service?

07:31.480 --> 07:33.562
Ron was 10th battalion.
I worked for Artemus.

07:33.680 --> 07:34.761
The military contractors?

07:34.840 --> 07:36.410
Yeah.
Looks like Mr. Hurd

07:36.480 --> 07:38.767
had a pretty good security system.
Any cameras?

07:38.840 --> 07:40.729
Not part of
the employee discount.

07:40.800 --> 07:42.768
You didn't touch
or move the body?

07:42.840 --> 07:45.810
No, sir. As soon as I saw
what happened, I called 911.

07:45.880 --> 07:47.530
(CELL PHONE RINGS)

07:48.000 --> 07:49.445
That's the company
looking for an update.

07:49.520 --> 07:51.045
Okay if I take it?
Yeah.

07:51.880 --> 07:52.961
Hello?

07:54.400 --> 07:57.290
So we got a security guy
killed in his own home,

07:57.360 --> 08:00.762
had his gun right next to him, didn't
call 911, didn't turn on the alarm.

08:00.840 --> 08:02.604
Sounds like he let
his killer in the house.

08:02.680 --> 08:04.523
But what made the hole
that big in his chest?

08:04.600 --> 08:05.647
We don't have a murder weapon.

08:05.760 --> 08:06.841
And why steal his medals?

08:06.920 --> 08:08.410
Well, maybe the killer
didn't think he deserved them.

08:08.480 --> 08:09.641
Why would you care?

08:09.720 --> 08:11.484
Unless you were
military yourself.

08:13.080 --> 08:14.320
The cops are still here.

08:14.400 --> 08:16.323
Ron called me last night.

08:16.400 --> 08:17.606
Frankie's in Portland.

08:17.720 --> 08:18.846
What the hell for?

08:19.400 --> 08:20.640
You think she killed Ron?

08:20.800 --> 08:22.131
I don't think she could.

08:23.080 --> 08:25.128
Just watch your back.

08:29.440 --> 08:31.283
Ready for coffee?
Oh, yeah.

08:32.919 --> 08:34.524
Did you talk to your mom?

08:34.640 --> 08:36.210
Well, yeah.

08:36.280 --> 08:37.280
We're on for tonight.

08:37.400 --> 08:38.400
How are you doing?

08:38.440 --> 08:41.364
You okay? How did she sound? Was
she emotional? Were you emotional?

08:41.440 --> 08:43.681
I mean, seven years... That's a big deal.
I'm very proud of you.

08:43.760 --> 08:47.321
Uh, I didn't actually talk
to her, verbally speaking.

08:47.960 --> 08:49.450
You didn't call her?

08:50.280 --> 08:52.328
I emailed her.
I'm sorry. I just...

08:52.440 --> 08:54.488
I thought it would
be easier that way.

08:54.560 --> 08:55.891
And?

08:55.960 --> 08:57.200
So far, so good.

08:57.280 --> 09:00.045
We have to be there by 5:30.
They eat early.

09:01.720 --> 09:03.085
"They"?

09:03.200 --> 09:04.565
My sister's going to be there.

09:07.720 --> 09:09.210
DeEtta?
Yes.

09:09.280 --> 09:12.045
The same DeEtta who spent
the best years of her life

09:12.120 --> 09:14.691
sacrificing at home
while Rosalee

09:14.800 --> 09:17.371
frolicked up and down the coast.

09:22.320 --> 09:23.321
(SIGHS)

09:23.720 --> 09:25.529
I'm really glad
you're going with me.

09:25.600 --> 09:27.204
I don't think I could
do this by myself.

09:27.480 --> 09:28.481
(SIGHS)

09:31.160 --> 09:32.844
Well, I suppose
we should bring something,

09:33.000 --> 09:34.604
you know, to ease our way in.

09:36.600 --> 09:38.807
A bottle of wine would
be nice for my mom

09:38.920 --> 09:41.082
and a quart of Jack Daniel's
for the martyr.

09:45.080 --> 09:46.650
It sounds fun.

09:49.720 --> 09:53.042
Ron Hurd did three tours in Iraq...
Honorable discharge.

09:53.120 --> 09:55.600
Iraqi war service medal
and two Purple Hearts.

09:55.680 --> 09:57.250
So Ron's a hero.

09:57.320 --> 09:58.560
Apparently not to everyone.

09:58.640 --> 10:02.850
Last credit card purchase
was at VFW Post 97896,

10:02.920 --> 10:06.447
$35 tab at the bar,
settled up at 11:03 p.m.,

10:06.520 --> 10:08.682
and his last three calls
on his cell phone

10:08.800 --> 10:10.928
were right after
that to a Jim McCabe.

10:11.960 --> 10:13.644
As in McCabe Security?
Yeah.

10:14.040 --> 10:17.203
First two calls lasted only a few
seconds... Probably voice mail.

10:17.720 --> 10:20.485
Last call at 12:09
lasted just under two minutes.

10:20.560 --> 10:22.005
Well,
let's go talk to Jim McCabe

10:22.120 --> 10:23.565
and hit the VFW
on the way there.

10:31.320 --> 10:34.369
WOMAN: Hey, honey.
We have a nice surprise.

10:34.920 --> 10:37.241
An old friend's
dropped by to see you.

10:37.320 --> 10:39.084
She hasn't seen you since Iraq.

10:40.160 --> 10:42.845
You two catch up.
I'll get you something to eat.

10:48.520 --> 10:50.602
What the hell do you
think you're doing?

10:50.680 --> 10:53.684
I really like your wife.
She's very nice.

10:54.480 --> 10:56.005
I guess you never
told her about us.

10:56.080 --> 10:58.003
Get out of my house.

10:58.760 --> 11:01.331
We've got a lot of
catching up to do.

11:03.040 --> 11:04.769
It seems like I cut myself.

11:05.160 --> 11:06.605
(CLATTER IN KITCHEN)

11:07.000 --> 11:09.480
That's what happens when you
hold something in for too long.

11:09.560 --> 11:11.449
WOMAN:
You want iced tea or a soda?

11:11.920 --> 11:13.490
Anything!

11:14.080 --> 11:16.924
Get out of here,
or I'm calling the police.

11:18.160 --> 11:21.960
I want you to call the police.
You know you should.

11:22.040 --> 11:25.408
You're gonna be seeing
a lot more of me until you do.

11:27.760 --> 11:29.125
How's sex with your wife?

11:31.200 --> 11:33.089
You ever think of me?

11:37.200 --> 11:38.201
(DOOR OPENS)

11:39.760 --> 11:40.761
(DOOR CLOSES)

11:46.160 --> 11:47.764
What happened to your friend?

11:48.680 --> 11:50.045
She had to leave.

11:50.760 --> 11:52.569
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

11:57.240 --> 11:59.129
(IN THE MOOD PLAYING)

12:03.360 --> 12:04.646
Somebody's in the mood.

12:04.800 --> 12:06.040
At this hour?

12:11.480 --> 12:14.245
Are you two handsome soldiers
here for the dance class?

12:14.320 --> 12:17.290
Well, take off your
coats and partner up.

12:17.360 --> 12:19.966
No, we're just...

12:20.040 --> 12:21.405
ls there someone who works here?

12:21.520 --> 12:22.931
Well, Candy's in back.

12:23.000 --> 12:26.049
But if you change your minds,
you're welcome to join in.

12:30.560 --> 12:31.766
Can I help you?

12:31.840 --> 12:33.444
Yeah, we just have to ask

12:33.520 --> 12:35.680
a few questions about a patron
who was here last night.

12:35.720 --> 12:37.484
CANDY: Okay.
His name's Ron Hurd.

12:37.560 --> 12:39.642
Oh, God, what did Ronny do now?

12:40.000 --> 12:41.525
He was murdered last night.

12:42.120 --> 12:43.120
Excuse me?

12:43.160 --> 12:47.643
His last credit card transaction
was here at 11:03 p.m.

12:47.720 --> 12:49.290
I don't believe this.

12:49.360 --> 12:50.600
What time did he leave?

12:50.680 --> 12:52.489
Just after he paid
for the drinks.

12:52.560 --> 12:54.449
What happened?
Did he leave with anyone?

12:54.520 --> 12:57.285
No. He came in alone,
and he left alone.

12:57.360 --> 12:58.800
Was he with anyone
while he was here?

12:58.880 --> 13:00.962
Yeah, the regulars.
Had dinner at the bar.

13:01.040 --> 13:02.769
Bought a round of drinks
for the guys.

13:02.840 --> 13:04.410
Do you know who?
I can get you names.

13:04.480 --> 13:06.403
Anything unusual
happen last night?

13:07.480 --> 13:09.403
Actually, there was.

13:09.480 --> 13:11.608
There was a young woman
who sat with him at the table,

13:11.680 --> 13:13.240
but he didn't seem
too happy to see her.

13:13.600 --> 13:15.489
That was right before he left.
Do you know her name?

13:15.560 --> 13:18.928
Never seen her before, but...

13:19.040 --> 13:21.566
But what? When I cleaned
his table last night,

13:21.640 --> 13:23.802
I found what I thought was
something pretty weird.

13:23.880 --> 13:26.201
It was a cocktail napkin
with blood on it.

13:26.280 --> 13:27.566
What did you do with the napkin?

13:29.680 --> 13:31.967
Do you remember
what the woman looked like?

13:32.080 --> 13:34.686
Late 20s, early 30s, dark hair.

13:34.760 --> 13:36.489
Was she military?
I don't know for sure,

13:36.560 --> 13:38.050
but she looked
like a tough lady.

13:38.120 --> 13:39.565
How long did she
stay after he left?

13:39.640 --> 13:40.641
Not very long.

13:40.720 --> 13:42.563
I'd say she left
within five minutes.

13:42.640 --> 13:44.847
HANK: You don't have any
surveillance cameras, do you?

13:45.000 --> 13:48.083
(LAUGHS) Who's gonna steal anything
with a bunch of soldiers around?

13:49.200 --> 13:50.929
Is this it?
Yeah.

13:52.360 --> 13:54.169
How do you get yourself
to bleed like that?

13:54.920 --> 13:57.321
Might be some kind of pattern.
I don't know.

14:07.480 --> 14:11.371
So are we gonna go in there
sometime today or...

14:13.080 --> 14:14.684
This may not go so well.

14:14.760 --> 14:17.730
On the other hand,
it might go really badly.

14:19.800 --> 14:20.881

14:20.960 --> 14:22.564

14:25.040 --> 14:26.690

make an attempt.

14:29.040 --> 14:30.280
Okay.

14:30.840 --> 14:32.729
You're right.
Let's do this.

14:37.040 --> 14:38.405
Okay, okay.

14:38.520 --> 14:43.287

but this is not an assault.

Hey, Rosalee.

Hi, DeEtta.
This is Monroe.

15:24.640 --> 15:26.244
It's a pleasure
to meet you both.

15:26.960 --> 15:30.567
Good thing you got here when you did.
Dinner's almost ready.

you doing, Frankie?

WOMAN: Mr. McCabe, two
detectives are here to see you.

15:47.240 --> 15:49.049
Send them in.

15:54.000 --> 15:56.207
Mr. McCabe, we're Detectives
Burkhardt and Griffin.

15:56.720 --> 15:58.051
You're here about Ron.

15:59.040 --> 16:00.166
Yes, we are.

16:00.280 --> 16:01.406
I'll help you any way I can.

16:01.520 --> 16:03.124
As soon as I heard
about what happened,

16:03.200 --> 16:05.248
I started racking my brain about
who could have done this.

16:05.360 --> 16:06.771
I'm afraid I haven't
come up with much,

16:06.880 --> 16:08.325
but I have put
together a file for you.

16:08.400 --> 16:10.323
Ron's full employment record,
clients he dealt with,

16:10.400 --> 16:11.970
jobs he worked...
It's all in there.

16:12.040 --> 16:13.963
He called you
last night at 12:10.

16:14.040 --> 16:15.280
Yes, he did.

16:15.360 --> 16:17.601
Mind telling us what
that conversation was about?

16:17.720 --> 16:19.085
He called about work...

16:19.440 --> 16:21.647
A job we're doing
in South Portland.

16:21.720 --> 16:23.324
It's a little late to
be calling about work.

16:23.400 --> 16:25.801
As you know,
security's a 24/7 job.

16:25.920 --> 16:27.922
Before he called you,
he was at the VFW

16:28.040 --> 16:30.008
having drinks
till about 11:00.

16:30.080 --> 16:32.162
There was a confrontation
there with a woman.

16:32.560 --> 16:33.600
Did he mention her to you?

16:33.680 --> 16:34.681
No.

16:34.760 --> 16:36.091
We just talked business.

16:36.200 --> 16:37.486
Was he seeing anyone?

16:37.600 --> 16:39.170
Do you know who the woman
could have been?

16:39.240 --> 16:42.528
No. Ron loved the ladies.

16:42.600 --> 16:46.491
Unfortunately, they only loved
him back about 10% of the time.

16:46.560 --> 16:48.688
Anyone you can think of
who might want him dead?

16:49.520 --> 16:51.284
Personal security's
a tough business.

16:51.440 --> 16:53.249
We don't always
make a lot of friends.

16:53.320 --> 16:54.401
That's Troy.

16:55.280 --> 16:57.009
Is that Ron?
Yeah.

16:57.120 --> 16:58.690
We spent time together in Iraq.

16:58.760 --> 17:01.206
Most of my employees have some
sort of military training.

17:01.960 --> 17:03.291
And who's that?

17:03.440 --> 17:04.726
Bobby Hammond.

17:04.800 --> 17:06.404
He work here too?
He did.

17:06.480 --> 17:08.767
Moved to Phoenix a couple years
ago, opened his own shop.

17:12.560 --> 17:13.891
Look“.

17:15.520 --> 17:17.807
Does this mean anything to you?

17:19.960 --> 17:22.930
No. Where'd you get that?

17:23.000 --> 17:25.731
It was left on
Ron's table at the VFW.

17:25.800 --> 17:27.404
I don't know.

17:27.480 --> 17:29.881
Well, you mind if I make
a copy of that photograph?

17:37.200 --> 17:38.920

Three tours of duty.

17:38.960 --> 17:42.282
The other three, Jim McCabe,
Troy Dodge, and Robert Hammond,

17:42.360 --> 17:45.011
were all working for Artemus
Security Contractors.

17:45.640 --> 17:46.801
They were all in Iraq
at the same time,

17:46.880 --> 17:49.167
they're all ex-military,
but only the army guy's dead.

17:50.880 --> 17:52.325

17:52.960 --> 17:54.803
What?
He's dead.

17:57.840 --> 18:00.002
When?
A week ago.

18:00.480 --> 18:01.527

19:32.440 --> 19:36.604
Because I'm sick and
tired of living with this,

19:36.720 --> 19:38.449
lying about it.

19:38.560 --> 19:41.006

and when they do,

19:41.080 --> 19:42.684

19:52.120 --> 19:53.690

for four years.

I followed her to the cafe,

20:21.560 --> 20:23.289
and I'm not quite
sure what I saw,

20:23.400 --> 20:25.084
but I think she had
some kind of pain.

20:25.520 --> 20:26.567
Because of the pregnancy?

20:26.960 --> 20:30.089
That's what it looked like,
but it's what happened after.

20:30.480 --> 20:33.643
She reached for her coffee, and I
swear she never touched the cup,

20:33.720 --> 20:36.246
but it moved away from her hand.

20:36.320 --> 20:38.561
And then she put
her hand out again,

20:38.640 --> 20:40.802
and this time, the cup
moved right into her hand.

20:40.880 --> 20:42.560
And what happened after that?
I'm not sure.

20:43.200 --> 20:45.487
Some kind of power surge,
and the lights exploded.

20:45.560 --> 20:47.403
But I don't think it had
anything to do with her.

20:47.480 --> 20:49.323
You can be sure it did.

he sent over on Robert Hammond

into his murder.

21:15.320 --> 21:16.731
We got a cause of death?

21:16.800 --> 21:19.167
Yeah, apparently he was
stabbed with a poison spike.

21:20.520 --> 21:21.681
They ID the poison?

21:21.840 --> 21:22.966

We're still waiting on Harper to get
the tox screen back on our vic,

21:25.880 --> 21:28.486
but the spike in
the chest is the same.

So Rosalee tells me
you repair clocks.

22:25.480 --> 22:29.690
I do, actually. I'm from a
long line of clock folk,

22:29.760 --> 22:32.206
all the way back to the
Black Forest in Germany,

22:32.280 --> 22:33.770
where my
great-great-grandfather

22:33.880 --> 22:35.370
was a master designer of clocks.

22:35.440 --> 22:36.885

watches to repair

22:39.240 --> 22:42.005
from all over the world, and
he's very, very good at it.

for that kind of detail.

Pacific Northwest sales rep

22:58.800 --> 23:00.211
for Simpson Dental Devices.

23:01.080 --> 23:03.560
Hmm. That must have
been very interesting.

But now I make false
teeth here at home.

after my father died.

Why stop her now, Mom?

23:11.960 --> 23:15.362
Well, I'm just saying,
I came home, and you didn't.

23:16.160 --> 23:17.889
I mean, that's what happened,
isn't it?

23:18.040 --> 23:19.769
Yes, that's what happened.

23:20.080 --> 23:22.048
You came home, and I
partied my little ass off

23:22.120 --> 23:23.565
up and down the coast.

23:23.640 --> 23:27.008
Hmm. So false teeth... I mean,
how do you get into that?

23:27.080 --> 23:28.491
You know what, Rosalee?

23:28.560 --> 23:31.291
I'd be okay with
all of that, really.

23:32.160 --> 23:35.050
But not showing up
for your own father's funeral?

pay a little respect.

her in seven years,

23:42.680 --> 23:44.728

get another chance.

23:48.360 --> 23:50.761

you just couldn't...

23:50.840 --> 23:52.205
I was in jail.

23:58.600 --> 24:01.604
I got involved
with the wrong people,

24:01.680 --> 24:03.648
and I lost everything.

24:04.640 --> 24:06.165
And I got caught...

24:07.640 --> 24:09.051

24:09.600 --> 24:12.285
I didn't find out about the
funeral until after I got out,

24:12.360 --> 24:13.964
and by then, neither of
you were speaking to me,

24:14.040 --> 24:15.565
so what was I supposed to do?

24:18.080 --> 24:19.445
How about apologize?

say good-bye to Dad.

24:48.720 --> 24:49.846
It's okay.

24:49.920 --> 24:51.160
No, it's not. It's not.

24:51.240 --> 24:52.605
It's not.
Yes, it's okay!

24:52.720 --> 24:54.848
It's out.
It's not hidden anymore.

24:54.920 --> 24:56.490
I mean, what, did you
expect to just show up

24:56.560 --> 24:57.766
and have everything be okay?

24:57.920 --> 24:59.126
I don't know!

24:59.200 --> 25:00.326
I don't know what
I was expecting...

25:00.400 --> 25:03.768
Maybe a little,
you know, gratitude

25:03.840 --> 25:06.207
for picking up
the pieces after Freddy died.

25:07.880 --> 25:09.086

25:11.440 --> 25:14.046
You and your mom
and your sister...

25:16.400 --> 25:17.731
You share a history...

25:17.840 --> 25:19.205
Yeah.

25:19.280 --> 25:21.044
Of love and pain, and...

25:21.120 --> 25:22.770
And that's just family.

25:24.760 --> 25:26.649
There are no easy solutions.

25:32.400 --> 25:33.890
What did you shoplift?

25:35.280 --> 25:36.520
A watch.

25:36.600 --> 25:38.807
Really? What kind?

25:39.480 --> 25:40.811
(LAUGHS)

25:41.840 --> 25:42.841
Mmm.

25:46.720 --> 25:48.848
Those are the details.

25:52.320 --> 25:54.322
You really did these things?

25:56.480 --> 25:59.165
I wanted to turn myself
in at the time.

25:59.960 --> 26:01.530
Why didn't you?

26:01.600 --> 26:03.250
I was a coward.

26:03.320 --> 26:06.881
The others told me I shouldn't,
and I listened to them.

26:08.800 --> 26:10.006
They were right.

26:14.160 --> 26:17.482
Nobody's ever
going to read this.

26:17.560 --> 26:19.927

28:13.400 --> 28:14.401
Hmm.

28:15.160 --> 28:17.970
I got the video chat set up
with Ron Hurd's old C.O.,

28:18.040 --> 28:19.565
Colonel Adam Desai.

28:19.640 --> 28:21.449
When?
Now.

28:21.520 --> 28:23.966
He's in D.C.
at Walter Reed Hospital...

28:24.040 --> 28:25.451

28:30.440 --> 28:33.364
Colonel, thank you so much
for taking the time.

28:33.480 --> 28:35.130
This is my partner,
Detective Burkhardt.

28:35.200 --> 28:38.124
Wish I could be there in person,
but the lungs won't allow it.

28:38.200 --> 28:39.406
We understand.

28:39.480 --> 28:41.642
Really sorry to hear about Ron.

28:41.720 --> 28:43.722
We were hoping you could
help us connect the dots

28:43.800 --> 28:46.326
between him and a few
military contractors.

28:46.400 --> 28:47.845
Did you get
the photo we sent you?

28:47.920 --> 28:52.050
I did. Jim McCabe, Troy
Dodge, Robert Hammond.

28:52.360 --> 28:53.521
So you knew them?

28:53.640 --> 28:54.846
Yes, Artemus Security.

28:55.040 --> 28:57.725
Our platoon was
stationed outside Balad...

28:57.840 --> 29:01.401
Minesweeping, peacekeeping...
But half the time

29:01.480 --> 29:04.484
we spent trying to undo
the damage those cowboys did.

29:04.960 --> 29:05.960
Damage?

29:06.000 --> 29:07.001
Harassing the locals,

29:07.080 --> 29:10.448
theft, extortion...
Dogs without a leash.

29:10.560 --> 29:11.686
You couldn't arrest them?

29:11.760 --> 29:13.762
You don't
understand the arrangement

29:13.880 --> 29:15.848
the military had with
the private contractors.

29:15.920 --> 29:17.251
What kind of
arrangement was that?

29:17.320 --> 29:18.526
A good one for them.

29:18.600 --> 29:21.763
Their deal with the government
exempted them from any prosecution.

29:21.840 --> 29:26.368
They were untouchable right up
until the winter of 2010,

29:26.440 --> 29:29.444
when Artemus finally
got kicked out of Iraq.

29:29.520 --> 29:31.329
You said they were
exempt from prosecution.

29:31.400 --> 29:33.402
Were they ever brought up
on charges for anything?

29:34.520 --> 29:37.205
A specialist under
my command came to me,

29:37.280 --> 29:40.921
said that Ron and these
Artemus guys had raped her.

29:41.800 --> 29:44.121
I reported the incident
to my superior

29:44.240 --> 29:46.527
but was told to
look the other way.

29:46.920 --> 29:48.160
But Ron was under your command.

29:48.200 --> 29:49.960
He was transferred
before I could do anything

29:50.000 --> 29:52.002
except file
a restricted complaint.

29:52.560 --> 29:53.641
Went nowhere.

29:53.720 --> 29:55.609
What was the name
of this specialist?

29:56.440 --> 29:57.680
Frankie Gonzales.

29:57.800 --> 29:59.040
Do you know where she is?

29:59.120 --> 30:00.963
As far as I know,
she's in South Carolina.

30:01.520 --> 30:05.047
Do you remember the date this
attack on Gonzales happened?

30:05.520 --> 30:06.726
Never forget it.

30:07.320 --> 30:09.766
November 11, 2010.

30:15.280 --> 30:16.884
It's a date.

30:19.040 --> 30:20.451
I hate to say this,

30:20.520 --> 30:24.047
but whatever those guys are
getting, they deserve.

It's time for my chemo.

a month ago in Phoenix.

31:03.880 --> 31:05.530
Same place Bobby Hammond
was killed.

31:05.600 --> 31:07.523
I think we better find out if
she made her way to Portland.

31:07.600 --> 31:08.931
Got a double murder...

31:09.000 --> 31:10.889
Same guy who found
your victim's body

31:11.000 --> 31:12.889
and his wife,
Troy and Betsy Dodge.

31:19.160 --> 31:21.083
Same type of stab wound.

31:22.440 --> 31:24.408
You think Frankie's doing this?

31:24.480 --> 31:27.290
If she is, I sure wish
I knew what she was using.

Hold on.
Let me get Nick.

31:50.600 --> 31:53.763
Wu's on the phone. He just got the
tox report on the first victim.

31:53.840 --> 31:56.161
It's a match to what
they found in Phoenix.

31:57.080 --> 31:58.161
Let's have it.

31:58.240 --> 32:01.210
Both victims died from an
excessive dose of neurotoxins

32:01.280 --> 32:04.602
and enzyme inhibitors associated
with the family Buthidae.

32:04.680 --> 32:05.681
English, Wu.

32:06.880 --> 32:08.644
The closest match
is scorpion venom.

32:10.920 --> 32:12.684
Obviously, we're not
talking a real scorpion

32:12.840 --> 32:14.604
'cause it would have
to be six feet tall.

32:15.760 --> 32:16.761
That's all I got.

32:16.840 --> 32:17.841
Thanks.

32:17.920 --> 32:19.604
This look familiar to you?

32:20.520 --> 32:23.205
November 11th...
The day Frankie was attacked.

32:23.280 --> 32:24.805
We better find out what the
hell we're dealing with.

32:24.920 --> 32:28.367
Neurotoxins, enzyme inhibitors...
I'm gonna call Juliette.

32:28.520 --> 32:30.761
Yeah, dealing with
a six-foot-tall scorpion,

32:30.880 --> 32:33.087
we're gonna need all
the help we can get.

32:34.440 --> 32:38.570
Okay, the first candidate
is from 13th-century France.

32:38.800 --> 32:40.131
It's called a Trasque.

32:40.200 --> 32:43.761

loves the singing of maidens.

what we're looking for.

a little bit further back

37:39.400 --> 37:40.970
I told you they'd never confess.

37:41.080 --> 37:42.684
I should have
done this years ago.

37:43.920 --> 37:45.285
I let you down.

37:46.560 --> 37:50.246
I let myself down.
I failed in my duty.

37:52.440 --> 37:54.010
Take care of yourself, Frankie.

37:55.680 --> 37:57.364
He's at the VFW.

38:10.520 --> 38:12.045
You Desai?

38:12.120 --> 38:13.406
That's right.

38:15.600 --> 38:17.090
Where's the bartender?

38:18.400 --> 38:21.404
I sent her out to buy me
a pack of smokes.

38:21.480 --> 38:23.050
It's a little late to quit now.

38:24.640 --> 38:27.211
You said you had something
I'd be interested in.

38:29.560 --> 38:34.282
The restricted complaint
I filed November 12, 2010,

38:34.360 --> 38:39.002
the day after you raped
Specialist Frankie Gonzales.

38:39.080 --> 38:40.525
Last copy.

38:41.720 --> 38:44.371
This goes away,
your problem goes away.

38:44.440 --> 38:45.805
How much?

38:46.240 --> 38:48.083
What's a clear conscience worth?

38:48.560 --> 38:50.050
Nothing.

38:50.400 --> 38:53.085
Psycho bitch is out of control.

38:54.880 --> 38:57.247
I'd say you were
the one who's out of control.

38:58.200 --> 39:00.487
I killed your friends
Ron and Robert.

39:03.120 --> 39:06.283
But I didn't kill Troy and his wife.
That must have been you.

39:12.240 --> 39:14.322
The idiot wanted to confess.

39:16.320 --> 39:18.721
I guess it's
between you and me now.

39:21.280 --> 39:23.647
I think that's
the way it should be.

39:24.960 --> 39:26.644
It's in our nature.

39:27.800 --> 39:29.290
(GROWLS)

39:31.120 --> 39:32.121
(GROWLS)

39:35.640 --> 39:37.165
(BOTH ROARING)

40:19.520 --> 40:20.521
(ROARS)

40:31.480 --> 40:33.687
McCabe, back away!

40:34.000 --> 40:35.001
(GROANS)

40:39.520 --> 40:41.887
HANK: Drop it. Turn around.

40:45.600 --> 40:48.604
On the ground.
Hands where I can see them.

40:48.680 --> 40:50.284
It was self-defense.

40:51.000 --> 40:53.765
Yeah? Not what we saw.

40:55.920 --> 40:58.764
You can't arrest him for
what he did to Frankie,

40:58.840 --> 41:01.207
but you can for
what he did to me.

41:15.840 --> 41:17.046
Troy wrote this?

41:17.160 --> 41:18.889
Apparently, he
couldn't live with it either.

41:24.960 --> 41:26.724
This is all I ever wanted.

41:27.280 --> 41:29.601
The D.A. will
probably want you to testify.

41:32.760 --> 41:34.250
I can do that.

41:36.920 --> 41:39.924
The colonel left
the hospital four weeks ago.

41:40.000 --> 41:41.923
They'd only given him
three months to live.

41:42.000 --> 41:44.128
This was his shot at redemption.

41:46.600 --> 41:48.682
The colonel was a good soldier.

41:49.480 --> 41:50.970
And so were you.

42:02.600 --> 42:04.443
