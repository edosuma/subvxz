WEBVTT

00:01.627 --> 00:03.044
Previously on...

00:03.170 --> 00:04.086
My name's Sean.

00:04.212 --> 00:05.547
Son of Harry Wilson
and Tracy Clark.

00:05.673 --> 00:07.132
I didn't exactly have
the most stable upbringing.

00:07.257 --> 00:08.926
Certainly didn't grow up
in a place like this.

00:09.050 --> 00:10.678
You're the first brother
at West Beverly

00:10.803 --> 00:13.263
to play varsity lacrosse as
long as anyone can remember.

00:13.388 --> 00:14.097
Who is that?

00:14.222 --> 00:15.390
Um...

00:15.516 --> 00:16.600
just a cheerleader.

00:16.725 --> 00:17.935
Everything you have done

00:18.059 --> 00:19.478
was just to set me up
to ruin my birthday?

00:19.603 --> 00:20.729
Absolutely.

00:20.855 --> 00:23.064
Being your friend, I'm over it.

00:23.190 --> 00:24.608
(laughs)
I already beat you to it.

00:24.733 --> 00:25.526
You want to be with me?

00:25.651 --> 00:27.068
Well, yeah.

00:27.194 --> 00:28.111
I'm a virgin.

00:28.236 --> 00:29.112
(laughs):
What?

00:29.237 --> 00:30.238
I was trying to push you away.

00:30.364 --> 00:30.906
Why?

00:31.031 --> 00:32.281
Because I slept with Ryan.

00:32.406 --> 00:33.909
25 years,

00:34.034 --> 00:35.452
that's a long time.
I don't know that I can

00:35.577 --> 00:37.037
possibly make that up to you.

00:37.162 --> 00:39.790
It's all good.
Everything's cool here.

00:39.915 --> 00:42.417
I'm making myself right at home.

00:49.758 --> 00:51.301
ETHAN:
Ah, you should have seen me.

00:51.426 --> 00:53.261
I was poppin' huge air
off all the moguls

00:53.387 --> 00:54.847
and just shredding down
the black diamonds.

00:54.972 --> 00:56.181
Look at you,
Mr. Hotshot Boarder.

00:56.306 --> 00:57.265
You gotta come
next year.

00:57.391 --> 00:58.266
I really missed you.

00:58.392 --> 01:00.101
No, you missed
the chance to laugh at me

01:00.227 --> 01:01.729
when I face-planted
off the ski lift.

01:01.854 --> 01:03.689
I'm a simple man
with simple pleasures.

01:03.814 --> 01:06.942
Kansas, darling,
how was your winter break?

01:07.067 --> 01:09.236
Oh, my God, Mom and I
took Sean to Cancun,

01:09.361 --> 01:10.654
but you probably already
heard that from him.

01:10.779 --> 01:11.780
Yep, he mentioned it.

01:11.906 --> 01:13.114
Oh, my God,
he's so awesome.

01:13.240 --> 01:14.909
It was so great
to spend that quality time

01:15.034 --> 01:16.827
with my half brother.
I mean, our half brother.

01:16.952 --> 01:18.662
I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean
to exclude you.

01:18.787 --> 01:20.497
No problem.
You didn't.

01:20.622 --> 01:22.499
We had a blast.

01:22.624 --> 01:25.168
Oh, my God, I totally dared Sean
to eat a fried grasshopper.

01:25.293 --> 01:27.004
And we laughed so hard,

01:27.128 --> 01:28.797
I thought grasshopper was going
to come out his nose.

01:28.923 --> 01:30.298
I'm so sorry you missed it.

01:30.424 --> 01:31.842
It's not a competition,
Naomi.

01:31.967 --> 01:34.261
You can Sean it up
as much as you want.

01:34.386 --> 01:36.805
That is really mature of you,
Annie.

01:36.931 --> 01:39.140
Honestly, I don't think
I could be quite so open-minded

01:39.266 --> 01:40.684
if Sean didn't want
to hang out with me.

01:40.809 --> 01:41.936
Well, it was

01:42.061 --> 01:42.853
an adjustment,
what with him wanting

01:42.978 --> 01:44.187
to stay at your
house and all.

01:44.312 --> 01:45.856
Oh, wait.

01:45.981 --> 01:47.608
He's staying with us.
My bad.

01:47.733 --> 01:49.359
Point, Miss Wilson.

01:49.484 --> 01:50.611
Mm.

01:50.736 --> 01:53.196
ADRIANNA:
Okay, well,

01:53.321 --> 01:56.491
can you let me know
if you hear from him?

01:56.617 --> 01:58.326
Hey. You okay?

01:58.452 --> 02:01.038
Yeah, um...

02:01.162 --> 02:03.457
it's just I have this
friend Hank from rehab?

02:03.582 --> 02:06.043
He hasn't returned
any of my texts.

02:06.167 --> 02:08.169
Nobody from group
has even heard from him.

02:08.294 --> 02:09.378
Could he be on vacation?

02:09.503 --> 02:10.714
Maybe.

02:10.839 --> 02:12.257
But when an addict just
disappears like that...

02:12.382 --> 02:14.175
(bell rings)

02:14.301 --> 02:15.552
Everybody, settle in, please.

02:15.677 --> 02:17.638
Take your seats.
Thank you very much.

02:17.763 --> 02:20.390
Today we're gonna talk
about perception.

02:20.515 --> 02:22.810
I mean, how do we even perceive?

02:22.935 --> 02:25.729
Well, the eyes take in
information

02:25.854 --> 02:27.731
and then it passes that
information off to the brain.

02:27.856 --> 02:30.651
Seems pretty straightforward,
but you can

02:30.776 --> 02:32.820
still see without using
your eyes,

02:32.945 --> 02:34.237
and that's called...

02:34.362 --> 02:35.614
(chalk scrapes on blackboard)

02:35.739 --> 02:37.574
..."intuition."

02:37.699 --> 02:39.868
Using your intuition.

02:45.958 --> 02:47.793
I'm so sorry.

02:47.918 --> 02:49.503
I wish I had better news.

02:49.628 --> 02:51.755
And there's nothing
that I can do?

02:51.880 --> 02:54.633
Some surgery or drug therapy?

02:54.758 --> 02:56.093
Not in this case.

02:56.217 --> 02:58.512
Is there somebody I can call
for you? A husband?

02:58.637 --> 03:00.388
A boyfriend?

03:00.514 --> 03:01.890
No, there's no guy
in the picture at the moment.

03:02.016 --> 03:03.892
You said you used
to live here before.

03:04.018 --> 03:05.393
Are there some friends you could
talk to about this?

03:05.519 --> 03:08.522
I've burned
all of those bridges.

03:14.486 --> 03:15.487
Hey, D.

03:15.612 --> 03:16.780
Hey, girl. What's up?

03:16.905 --> 03:18.365
Got this week's new pick.

03:18.490 --> 03:19.533
It's a rough mix

03:19.658 --> 03:21.702
of a new band
my dad just signed,

03:21.827 --> 03:23.120
Drops In The Fall.
Excellent.

03:23.244 --> 03:25.664
Oh, yeah, and thank you
for the Sam Cooke stuff.

03:25.789 --> 03:28.291
I knew about his R&amp;B stuff, but
I didn't know he did gospel.

03:28.416 --> 03:29.710
Really? That's how
he got started.

03:29.835 --> 03:31.545
It blew me away.

03:31.670 --> 03:32.796
Hey, babe.
Hey, Silver.

03:32.921 --> 03:33.922
How was your winter break?

03:34.048 --> 03:35.423
Oh, you know,
the usual:

03:35.549 --> 03:38.426
eggnog, sugar crash,
remorse, New Year's.

03:40.846 --> 03:42.723
Well, tell me what you think.

03:42.848 --> 03:43.724
Yes.

03:43.849 --> 03:45.433
Bye, D.

03:45.559 --> 03:47.519
Peace.

03:47.644 --> 03:49.270
Bye, D.

03:49.396 --> 03:51.523
Why you gotta act
like that?

03:51.648 --> 03:52.691
Have we met?

03:52.816 --> 03:55.069
And besides, I think
she's into you.

03:55.194 --> 03:57.029
Which doesn't make me want
to hug her.

03:57.154 --> 03:58.405
Except for maybe
around the neck.

03:58.530 --> 03:59.656
(laughs)
You're crazy.

03:59.781 --> 04:01.075
Yeah, well,
it works for me.

04:01.200 --> 04:04.703
But anyway, Bio awaits.
Later, D.

04:17.048 --> 04:18.425
Hi, Annie.

04:18.550 --> 04:19.466
Oh!

04:19.593 --> 04:20.844
Hey.

04:20.969 --> 04:22.679
Hey, I just came to see my dad.

04:22.804 --> 04:24.014
Yeah, we're goin' surfing.

04:24.139 --> 04:27.768
I know. He wanted
to take the van.

04:30.062 --> 04:31.521
So, how's school?

04:31.646 --> 04:34.524
You know, reading, writing,
all that fun stuff.

04:34.649 --> 04:35.525
Arithmetic.

04:35.650 --> 04:36.693
Yup.

04:36.818 --> 04:38.319
That's pretty much
how I remember it.

04:38.445 --> 04:40.405
NAOMI:
Surf's up!

04:42.032 --> 04:42.908
You're going surfing.

04:43.033 --> 04:44.492
Yeah, Sean
invited me.

04:44.618 --> 04:46.369
Oh, you don't
surf, do you?

04:46.494 --> 04:47.704
SEAN:
Harry's an amazing teacher.

04:47.829 --> 04:48.747
You should come, Annie.

04:48.872 --> 04:49.831
You should come.

04:49.957 --> 04:51.083
I mean, you don't
have to be

04:51.208 --> 04:52.709
naturally
graceful to surf.

04:52.834 --> 04:55.378
You know, I'm gonna pass.

04:55.503 --> 04:56.838
But, uh, tell

04:56.964 --> 04:58.506
my dad I had to run.

04:58.632 --> 04:59.633
I'll see you guys later.

04:59.758 --> 05:01.802
Boo.

05:06.265 --> 05:08.934
Hey, Miss Taylor, um,
do you have a minute?

05:09.059 --> 05:10.811
Sure, yeah. Come on in.

05:10.936 --> 05:12.771
Sit down.

05:12.896 --> 05:13.981
How are you?

05:14.106 --> 05:16.984
I'm... I'm okay, I guess.

05:17.109 --> 05:18.902
I was wondering
if you had a way

05:19.027 --> 05:20.487
to get in touch
with Miss Walsh.

05:20.612 --> 05:21.655
Uh, Brenda?

05:21.780 --> 05:23.531
Yeah. Um,

05:23.657 --> 05:26.076
my rehab group is hosting
this support day tomorrow

05:26.201 --> 05:27.953
to thank all the people
who have helped

05:28.078 --> 05:29.663
with our recovery.

05:29.788 --> 05:31.081
Most people would bring
their families,

05:31.206 --> 05:32.582
but I was gonna
bring Navid,

05:32.707 --> 05:33.834
but he's at his cousin
Avi's wedding.

05:33.959 --> 05:34.918
I see.

05:35.043 --> 05:36.086
Your mom can't make it.

05:36.211 --> 05:37.504
Well, she could.

05:37.629 --> 05:39.840
I just kinda don't want her
there.

05:39.965 --> 05:41.675
She pretty much

05:41.800 --> 05:45.804
checked out on that whole
stand-by-your-kid thing.

05:45.929 --> 05:47.681
Does that make me a jerk?

05:47.806 --> 05:51.018
No, it makes you somebody
who's looking out for herself.

05:51.143 --> 05:52.769
But I'm sorry

05:52.894 --> 05:54.437
your mom's not there for you.

05:54.562 --> 05:57.024
It's okay.
Miss Walsh was,

05:57.149 --> 06:00.401
and, uh, I'd really like her
to come.

06:00.527 --> 06:03.905
Uh, you know what?

06:04.031 --> 06:06.491
Brenda is usually pretty busy

06:06.616 --> 06:08.076
with her work.
Oh...

06:08.994 --> 06:10.912
Sure.

06:12.247 --> 06:14.124
Okay.

06:14.249 --> 06:15.542
But you know what?

06:16.877 --> 06:17.711
I will talk to her.

06:17.836 --> 06:18.920
Thank you

06:19.046 --> 06:20.505
so much, Miss Taylor.

06:20.630 --> 06:22.216
It really means a lot to me.

06:31.933 --> 06:33.018
Chastity belt!
Giraffe!

06:33.143 --> 06:34.019
A promise ring.

06:34.144 --> 06:35.812
Uh, Cheerios.

06:35.937 --> 06:37.898
A tusk!
SEAN:
An elephant!

06:38.023 --> 06:39.233
(shouts)
(whoops)

06:39.358 --> 06:40.984
TABITHA:
What? How did you get that?

06:41.109 --> 06:42.152
That looks like a sock.

06:42.277 --> 06:43.444
That was the trunk.

06:43.570 --> 06:45.655
HARRY:
Let's go. Next, next!

06:45.780 --> 06:47.157
Time's running.

06:47.282 --> 06:48.992
It's a weapon.
Somebody's hunting!

06:49.117 --> 06:50.827
Hunting.
SEAN:
Archery.

06:50.952 --> 06:52.079
Yes!

06:52.204 --> 06:53.621
(all clamoring)
What?!

06:53.747 --> 06:55.456
That drawing looked
like a sock, too.

06:55.582 --> 06:56.457
An argyle sock.

06:56.583 --> 06:58.501
HARRY:
Go, go, go!

06:58.626 --> 07:00.003
Yeah, I know, a sock.

07:00.128 --> 07:02.089
That is a small...
Oh! Time is up.
Thank God!

07:02.214 --> 07:03.090
Good!
(laughs)

07:03.215 --> 07:04.758
Whoo!

07:04.883 --> 07:05.592
How'd we do?

07:05.717 --> 07:06.801
Nine points, b-b-baby!

07:06.927 --> 07:08.678
(men cheer)

07:08.803 --> 07:11.765
♪ Wilson men kicking
ass and taking names. ♪

07:11.890 --> 07:14.475
TABITHA:
Why don't you let a real artiste

07:14.601 --> 07:16.103
show you how it's done?

07:16.228 --> 07:17.104
Ready, girls?

07:17.229 --> 07:18.897
Ready.
Ready.

07:19.022 --> 07:22.025
Come on, Grandma. Come on.

07:22.150 --> 07:24.111
Hmm...
HARRY:
It's a sock.

07:24.236 --> 07:25.862
(laughing)

07:28.073 --> 07:30.117
Tabitha, could you
pick up the pace?

07:32.660 --> 07:34.662
Um, she's crosshatching.

07:34.788 --> 07:35.538
Tabitha!

07:35.663 --> 07:36.539
Here, let me try again.

07:36.664 --> 07:38.875
Tabula rasa.

07:39.000 --> 07:39.834
Shoot me now.

07:39.960 --> 07:41.628
(phone rings)

07:43.671 --> 07:45.132
Oh, excuse me.

07:45.257 --> 07:47.717
SEAN:
Hello.
Um...

07:47.842 --> 07:48.927
a skull?

07:49.052 --> 07:50.053
Death?

07:50.178 --> 07:51.221
Murder?

07:51.346 --> 07:53.056
No, though, come to think of it,

07:53.181 --> 07:54.141
it does resemble a bit

07:54.266 --> 07:56.935
of a Vanitas
still life.

07:57.060 --> 07:58.561
(laughs)
Come on,

07:58.686 --> 07:59.896
ladies, time is
running out.

08:00.021 --> 08:00.814
Says who?

08:00.939 --> 08:02.190
Oh, boo!

08:02.316 --> 08:03.900
Come on!
All right, all right.

08:04.025 --> 08:06.194
Don't get your panties
in a bunch.

08:07.237 --> 08:08.947
Mm, thank you, Mom.

08:09.072 --> 08:10.282
Excellent job.
SEAN: You gotta
back off.

08:10.407 --> 08:12.117
I told you I'll get the money
and I will.

08:12.242 --> 08:13.701
All right, I just need
a little more time.

08:13.827 --> 08:15.120
And-And I promise...

08:15.245 --> 08:17.122
Hello?

08:17.247 --> 08:19.040
Damn!

08:19.166 --> 08:21.835
Sean, what's
going on?

08:38.893 --> 08:40.895
♪ ♪

08:41.980 --> 08:44.274
It's nothing, really.

08:44.399 --> 08:45.775
What I heard wasn't

08:45.900 --> 08:46.985
nothing.

08:47.110 --> 08:48.111
It was definitely something.

08:48.236 --> 08:49.612
HARRY:
Sean, we're family here.

08:49.737 --> 08:50.780
You can talk to us.

08:50.905 --> 08:53.992
Okay.

08:54.117 --> 08:56.036
My father, adopted father,
he, uh,

08:56.161 --> 08:59.206
he was a gambler.

08:59.331 --> 09:00.499
He made some
money at it.

09:00.623 --> 09:02.376
But then he got in
way over his head.

09:02.501 --> 09:05.128
He couldn't come up
with what he owed.

09:05.253 --> 09:08.882
So, he killed himself.

09:09.007 --> 09:10.258
Oh, my God.

09:11.843 --> 09:13.887
He did it to protect me.

09:14.012 --> 09:15.722
You know, he thought his
life insurance could
clear his debt,

09:15.847 --> 09:17.349
but sure enough, it turns out

09:17.474 --> 09:18.725
his policy doesn't cover
suicide.

09:18.850 --> 09:21.520
So now these guys,

09:21.644 --> 09:22.854
the guys that were after him
for the money...

09:22.979 --> 09:23.980
Now they're after you.

09:27.067 --> 09:28.402
Let us help.

09:28.527 --> 09:30.820
TABITHA:
How much did you father owe?

09:31.988 --> 09:34.074
$200,000.

09:35.450 --> 09:36.868
Ay-yi-yi.

09:36.993 --> 09:38.286
Look, I didn't want to
worry you with this.

09:38.412 --> 09:39.871
I'm shipping out in a week.

09:39.996 --> 09:41.206
What are they gonna do,
come to Iraq and find me?

09:41.331 --> 09:43.250
They don't have the guts.

09:46.794 --> 09:49.630
So, who's turn is it
to draw, huh?

10:01.435 --> 10:03.353
Hey, Annie,

10:03.478 --> 10:05.188
got a minute?

10:05.313 --> 10:06.565
Yeah.
I wanted
to apologize.

10:06.689 --> 10:08.358
I hope that phone call
didn't upset you.

10:08.483 --> 10:10.444
No, no, and-and I don't want you

10:10.569 --> 10:12.362
to think I was eavesdropping
on purpose.

10:12.487 --> 10:13.947
I was just there.
Of course.

10:14.072 --> 10:15.115
No, I know.
I'd hate to think

10:15.240 --> 10:16.324
that I, uh, you know,
caused you any worry.

10:16.450 --> 10:17.742
Oh, it's okay.

10:17.867 --> 10:19.453
I-I just thought my dad
would want to know,

10:19.578 --> 10:21.371
so I felt like I had
to say something.

10:21.496 --> 10:22.705
Yeah, yeah.

10:22.830 --> 10:25.208
It's nice to have people
around who care.

10:25.333 --> 10:26.876
(phone rings)
Oh.

10:27.001 --> 10:27.877
Here.

10:28.002 --> 10:29.379
Thanks.

10:32.840 --> 10:33.883
You could take that
if you want.

10:34.008 --> 10:35.469
No, no, it's late.

10:35.594 --> 10:36.970
It'll go to voicemail.
No worries.

10:38.930 --> 10:40.056
So,

10:40.181 --> 10:41.308
good night.

10:41.433 --> 10:43.310
Yeah.

10:43.435 --> 10:45.186
Uh, yeah.

10:45.312 --> 10:46.896
Good night.

10:48.231 --> 10:49.941
(phone chirps)

10:52.068 --> 10:53.945
(sighs)

10:55.530 --> 10:57.782
Mother, I doubt
that will help.

10:57.907 --> 10:59.826
Believe me, dear,
when the topic

10:59.951 --> 11:02.829
of discussion is money,
drinking always helps.

11:02.954 --> 11:04.289
What is

11:04.414 --> 11:05.665
the economic situation here?

11:05.790 --> 11:07.584
What are the options?
I do so wish I
could help.

11:07.708 --> 11:10.086
But I've taken such a beating
in the market recently,

11:10.211 --> 11:11.379
I simply can't.

11:11.505 --> 11:12.964
In fact,

11:13.089 --> 11:14.966
I think it's time for me
to go back to work.

11:15.091 --> 11:16.259
Really?

11:16.384 --> 11:17.802
Well, money's only
part of it.

11:17.927 --> 11:19.804
The truth is I miss acting.

11:19.929 --> 11:21.806
Digging into the script,

11:21.931 --> 11:23.975
arguing with the
director,

11:24.100 --> 11:25.977
canoodling with my co-stars.

11:26.102 --> 11:27.354
It's a calling.

11:31.983 --> 11:35.111
And then there were two.

11:35.236 --> 11:36.154
You know, our retirement account

11:36.279 --> 11:37.447
is in pretty
good shape.

11:37.572 --> 11:39.282
Because we've left it alone.

11:39.407 --> 11:40.825
I know, just
hear me out.

11:40.950 --> 11:42.910
We're not paying
rent here, right?

11:43.036 --> 11:47.207
The house in Wichita
will sell eventually.

11:47.332 --> 11:49.292
Maybe we borrow against
our 401(k).

11:49.417 --> 11:50.877
O-Or the kids' college funds.

11:51.002 --> 11:51.461
Harry...

11:51.586 --> 11:53.296
We can't do nothing.

11:53.421 --> 11:56.466
I-I know you're worried.

11:56.591 --> 11:58.092
I think, um...

11:58.218 --> 12:00.178
Tracy should

12:00.303 --> 12:02.180
be included in
this discussion.

12:02.305 --> 12:03.390
You would be okay with that?

12:03.515 --> 12:04.683
Well, she's Sean's mother.

12:04.807 --> 12:06.518
If I were in her place,
I would want to know.

12:06.643 --> 12:10.063
All right. I'm going to,
I'm going to give her a call.

12:10.188 --> 12:11.398
Thank you.

12:22.116 --> 12:24.911
Hey.

12:25.036 --> 12:27.080
Dad's pretty freaked out.

12:27.205 --> 12:28.831
Can you blame him?

12:30.124 --> 12:32.960
Dix, do you... Um...

12:34.212 --> 12:35.880
What do you
think about Sean?

12:36.005 --> 12:37.298
What do you mean,
what do I think about him?

12:37.424 --> 12:38.466
Don't you like him?

12:38.592 --> 12:40.009
Well, I've never really

12:40.134 --> 12:42.761
felt completely comfortable
around him, you know?

12:42.887 --> 12:45.515
I-I was walking by
his room before and...

12:46.641 --> 12:48.309
You know, it's probably nothing.

12:48.435 --> 12:49.436
What?

12:49.561 --> 12:52.063
He got a local call.

12:52.188 --> 12:54.315
(mock gasping):
No!

12:56.359 --> 12:57.444
All right, but he
got a local call.

12:57.569 --> 12:58.819
So?

12:58.945 --> 13:00.447
So, who'd be
calling him?

13:00.572 --> 13:02.198
He said he didn't
know anybody in town.

13:02.323 --> 13:04.033
I don't know.

13:04.158 --> 13:06.119
It could've been Tracy.

13:06.244 --> 13:08.246
Naomi or...

13:08.371 --> 13:09.247
a wrong number, you know?

13:09.372 --> 13:11.790
Yeah, yeah, I guess.

13:13.334 --> 13:15.503
Look, when Sean
first came here,

13:15.629 --> 13:16.963
you know, I freaked out.

13:17.088 --> 13:19.257
And it hurt Dad, a lot.

13:20.883 --> 13:24.887
Don't put everybody
through the same thing again.

13:25.012 --> 13:26.013
All right?

13:26.139 --> 13:26.889
Yeah.

13:29.517 --> 13:31.018
Good night.

13:31.144 --> 13:32.853
Night.

13:32.979 --> 13:34.355
(knocking on door)

13:39.152 --> 13:40.194
Kelly.

13:40.320 --> 13:41.820
Here on my doorstep.

13:41.946 --> 13:43.406
I wouldn't be if you'd
returned my calls today.

13:43.531 --> 13:45.742
Sorry, I just...

13:45.866 --> 13:47.661
couldn't deal with any
of the Ryan drama today.

13:47.786 --> 13:50.455
Probably should have thought of
that before you slept with him.

13:51.914 --> 13:53.500
That's not why I'm here.
Can I come in?

13:55.794 --> 13:58.963
Adrianna asked me to
get in touch with you.

13:59.088 --> 14:00.340
Her rehab group is
having support day.

14:00.465 --> 14:01.591
She wants you there.

14:01.716 --> 14:03.259
Why me?

14:03.384 --> 14:05.178
Because you stood up for her,

14:05.303 --> 14:06.471
more than her own mom.

14:06.596 --> 14:08.556
She sees you as
a mother figure.

14:08.682 --> 14:09.932
I didn't ask for that.

14:10.057 --> 14:11.434
But whether you
asked for it or not,

14:11.559 --> 14:12.352
that's the way it is.

14:12.477 --> 14:14.312
I can't make it.

14:14.437 --> 14:16.690
Why, because it's me asking?

14:16.815 --> 14:17.565
It's got nothing
to do with you.

14:17.691 --> 14:19.025
Then what is it?

14:19.150 --> 14:21.027
This girl is in the
early stages of recovery.

14:21.152 --> 14:22.278
She needs you.

14:22.403 --> 14:23.613
If you were
reaching out for help,

14:23.738 --> 14:26.032
wouldn't you want people
standing by you?

14:26.157 --> 14:28.117
I think you should leave.

14:29.494 --> 14:30.578
You know, Brenda,
I knew you were selfish.

14:30.704 --> 14:32.413
But this?

14:32.539 --> 14:35.166
This is unforgivable.

14:48.388 --> 14:51.683
If you're gonna ditch school,
go to the beach, not to work.

14:51.808 --> 14:53.434
Nat needed help
with the breakfast shift,

14:53.560 --> 14:55.019
so, I came through.

14:55.144 --> 14:56.688
Uh, you need a table?

14:56.813 --> 14:59.607
Nope, just coffee
and a bagel.

14:59.733 --> 15:02.109
Did you give that CD a listen?

15:02.235 --> 15:06.030
Actually, yeah, you know,
it reminded me of Prince.

15:06.155 --> 15:07.615
It kind of did.

15:07.741 --> 15:09.242
Maybe with a little
middle-period Curtis.

15:09.367 --> 15:11.369
Curtis...?

15:11.494 --> 15:13.329
You're kidding.

15:13.454 --> 15:14.706
Curtis Mayfield?

15:14.831 --> 15:17.166
Only, like, the greatest
songwriter of the '60s.

15:18.501 --> 15:20.044
What are you doing tomorrow?

15:20.169 --> 15:21.671
Nothing, why?

15:21.796 --> 15:23.130
My dad has this thing at
our beach house once a month--

15:23.256 --> 15:25.049
it's a gospel choir barbeque,

15:25.174 --> 15:26.342
a lot of people from his label,

15:26.467 --> 15:27.844
but the food is really good

15:27.968 --> 15:31.138
and the music is dope.
You should come.

15:31.264 --> 15:32.682
I mean, unless Silver would
have an issue with that.

15:32.807 --> 15:35.976
Oh, um, no,
nah, not at all.

15:36.102 --> 15:37.562
Not at all,
you just count me in.

15:37.687 --> 15:39.647
Here you go.

15:39.773 --> 15:41.524
I'll text you the details later.

15:41.649 --> 15:43.401
Keep the change.

15:43.526 --> 15:44.819
Thank you.

15:44.944 --> 15:46.529
TRACY:
We did mother and son Watsu.

15:46.654 --> 15:48.364
I thought we were close.

15:48.489 --> 15:49.532
It's not you.

15:49.657 --> 15:50.700
He didn't want anybody to know.

15:50.825 --> 15:54.328
This whole thing just
makes me sick to my stomach.

15:54.454 --> 15:55.455
If I hadn't
given him up...

15:55.580 --> 15:58.583
if he hadn't been adopted
by this terrible man!

15:58.708 --> 16:01.001
Tracy, we cannot beat
ourselves up about it.

16:01.127 --> 16:02.545
What is past is past.

16:02.670 --> 16:04.213
But he needs our help.

16:04.338 --> 16:05.673
Yeah.

16:05.799 --> 16:07.884
And the fact
of the matter is

16:08.008 --> 16:10.094
that I have means
that you two don't.

16:10.219 --> 16:11.554
Thank you, Tracy.

16:11.679 --> 16:13.222
That's very generous.

16:13.347 --> 16:16.058
I mean, it's not going to be
as easy with the divorce

16:16.183 --> 16:17.518
as it would've
been otherwise.

16:17.644 --> 16:18.561
I mean, there was
the pre-nup, so...

16:18.686 --> 16:19.604
Anything you could do
would be great.

16:19.729 --> 16:21.731
Oh.

16:21.856 --> 16:23.775
I think I'm going to call
my business manager.

16:23.900 --> 16:26.110
Maybe I will sell
some of Charles' art.

16:26.235 --> 16:27.737
There is a
Damien Hirst

16:27.862 --> 16:30.448
that I couldn't wait
to get out of my bathroom.

16:30.573 --> 16:31.991
I'll be in touch.

16:33.576 --> 16:35.119
We'll get through this.

16:39.415 --> 16:42.251
(exhales)

16:42.376 --> 16:43.753
Thank you for not

16:43.878 --> 16:45.880
stabbing her to death
with a pencil.

16:46.005 --> 16:47.340
If you had scissors
on your desk,

16:47.465 --> 16:48.341
it'd be a different story.

16:48.466 --> 16:50.426
(chuckles)

16:50.551 --> 16:52.804
But honestly, in this case
I think she's kind of entitled.

16:52.929 --> 16:54.347
Let's see what
she comes up with.

17:01.855 --> 17:04.816
Hey, want to go get some lunch?

17:04.941 --> 17:08.778
Yes, but first, I'm just
finishing up a post

17:08.903 --> 17:10.946
on that creepy custodian guy.

17:11.070 --> 17:11.698
You know, the one
with the lazy eye?

17:11.823 --> 17:12.906
I'm fairly certain he was

17:13.031 --> 17:14.157
checking out
my ass this morning.

17:14.282 --> 17:15.326
Then again,

17:15.451 --> 17:16.661
maybe he was just tired.

17:16.786 --> 17:18.704
(laughing)

17:18.829 --> 17:20.623
Ooh, want to see
something good?

17:20.748 --> 17:21.749
Check out my cheerleader post.

17:23.792 --> 17:25.502
Hmm, "Shake, Shimmy
and Shut Up."

17:25.627 --> 17:27.005
Nice headline.
Thank you.

17:27.128 --> 17:29.841
But the only one you mention
here by name is Christina.

17:29.966 --> 17:32.092
My blog is called
The Vicious Circle.

17:32.218 --> 17:33.594
And you know
my motto:

17:33.720 --> 17:35.346
Show no mercy.

17:35.471 --> 17:39.183
So, what's your deal
for tomorrow afternoon?

17:39.308 --> 17:41.853
There's a Tarantino
festival at the Arclight.

17:41.978 --> 17:44.230
I...
I know, I know
it's pretentious

17:44.355 --> 17:46.816
and violent and derivative
but totally awesome.

17:46.941 --> 17:48.275
If you just give Death Proof

17:48.401 --> 17:50.403
one chance, I swear
you're going to love it.

17:50.528 --> 17:52.154
I-I, um... I got a...

17:52.279 --> 17:53.656
I got to do a family thing.

17:53.781 --> 17:55.324
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

17:55.449 --> 17:57.618
No, Annie told me how crazy
things are with Sean.

17:57.744 --> 18:00.371
It's cool.
Yeah.

18:00.496 --> 18:02.707
Um, food. Starved.
Let's go.

18:08.755 --> 18:11.298
KELLY:
Brenda really
wanted to be here.

18:11.424 --> 18:14.385
Of course, um,
I understand.

18:14.510 --> 18:15.720
But I'm proud of you.

18:15.845 --> 18:17.221
What you've accomplished,
you're amazing.

18:17.346 --> 18:18.347
Thank you.

18:18.472 --> 18:19.891
Yes, she is. Hi.

18:20.016 --> 18:21.601
Oh, you made it.
Awesome.
Yeah.

18:21.726 --> 18:22.769
I'm sorry I'm late.

18:22.894 --> 18:24.311
Traffic's a bitch.

18:24.437 --> 18:26.355
ADRIANNA:
I'm so happy
you could come.

18:26.480 --> 18:27.565
There's so many people
I want to introduce you to.

18:27.690 --> 18:30.234
I'm really hoping that my
friend Hank shows up, too.

18:30.359 --> 18:31.611
Hello, everyone!

18:31.736 --> 18:33.404
If everybody could come inside,
we're gonna get started.

18:33.529 --> 18:34.614
Let's go.

18:38.158 --> 18:40.828
I wake up in the
middle of the night

18:40.954 --> 18:43.163
drenched in sweat,
hating myself.

18:43.289 --> 18:47.293
But when I realize
it's just a nightmare,

18:47.418 --> 18:49.670
I'm so relieved.

18:49.796 --> 18:51.965
Relieved that

18:52.090 --> 18:54.258
I'm okay,
relieved that I'm clean,

18:54.383 --> 18:55.843
and grateful.

18:55.969 --> 18:59.430
Grateful for all the people
who have been there for me.

18:59.555 --> 19:04.268
People who believed in me,

19:04.393 --> 19:06.854
even when I didn't
believe in myself.

19:09.523 --> 19:12.026
So, I think I'm gonna be okay.

19:20.701 --> 19:22.161
Would anybody from Adrianna's
support team like to share?

19:25.915 --> 19:28.876
I haven't really known
Adrianna that long,

19:29.002 --> 19:31.420
but ever since I met her,

19:31.545 --> 19:33.714
I've admired her
incredible spirit.

19:33.840 --> 19:37.135
She's passionate.
She's smart.

19:37.259 --> 19:38.886
And most importantly,
she actually learns

19:39.012 --> 19:41.305
from her mistakes, which is

19:41.430 --> 19:44.308
more than I can say for myself.

19:44.433 --> 19:45.643
She's my friend.

19:45.768 --> 19:48.270
And that's not a word
that I use lightly.

19:49.897 --> 19:51.524
And I'll always have her back.

20:00.825 --> 20:02.702
Hands off the fries.

20:02.827 --> 20:04.328
How'd you do that?

20:04.453 --> 20:05.830
Eyes in the back
of my head.

20:05.955 --> 20:07.498
I should use you for
this psych paper.

20:07.623 --> 20:10.126
Intuition and extrasensory
French fry perception.

20:10.250 --> 20:13.171
Your mother let you out of
the house in that outfit?

20:13.295 --> 20:14.630
Oh, my God, Annie.
You have to see these pictures.

20:14.755 --> 20:16.716
No, thanks.
Show me.

20:16.841 --> 20:17.925
Well, they're just
pictures of Sean and I.

20:18.051 --> 20:19.510
I'm going to put them
on Facebook later.

20:19.635 --> 20:20.928
Ooh, he's hot.

20:21.054 --> 20:23.848
Oh, my God.
This is us at the beach

20:23.973 --> 20:24.682
right before
going surfing.

20:24.807 --> 20:27.185
(girls oohing)

20:27.309 --> 20:30.897
Oh, and this is us
goofing off in the car.

20:35.151 --> 20:37.820
You can still see
without using your eyes.

20:37.945 --> 20:40.364
Sean, what's going on?

20:40.489 --> 20:41.532
You could take that if you want.

20:41.657 --> 20:42.950
It'll go to voicemail.
No worries.

20:43.076 --> 20:45.119
He got a local call. So?

20:45.244 --> 20:48.539
MS. MACGREGOR:
And that's called
using your intuition.

20:48.664 --> 20:49.498
ANNIE:
There's something
I gotta do

20:49.623 --> 20:50.708
What?

20:50.833 --> 20:52.710
Nothing, but
I gotta go.

20:52.835 --> 20:54.294
NAOMI:
Oh, my God.

20:54.420 --> 20:56.338
Can I just tell you,
he is so adorable.

21:00.634 --> 21:01.677
ANNIE:
Tell me I'm crazy.

21:01.802 --> 21:02.970
You're crazy.

21:03.096 --> 21:05.556
Yeah. Yeah, maybe I'm crazy.

21:05.681 --> 21:07.391
I mean, I'm probably crazy.

21:07.516 --> 21:09.643
At least I hope
that I'm crazy,

21:09.769 --> 21:12.563
because everybody loves him--
I mean, you, Dixon, Dad.

21:12.688 --> 21:13.647
Naomi obviously.

21:13.773 --> 21:15.566
Maybe she's right.

21:15.691 --> 21:17.359
Maybe I'm just jealous.

21:17.484 --> 21:18.402
Annie, whoa, take a breath.

21:18.527 --> 21:19.486
What are you talking about?

21:20.863 --> 21:24.742
Mom, there's something
off about Sean.

21:24.867 --> 21:27.036
And I don't have
any proof,

21:27.161 --> 21:30.248
and I know that and I really
don't want to hurt Dad,

21:30.372 --> 21:33.000
but I have this hunch
that something is not right.

21:35.502 --> 21:36.879
I know.

21:37.004 --> 21:38.005
I have the same feeling.

21:38.131 --> 21:39.006
You do?

21:39.132 --> 21:41.675
I thought it was just me.

21:41.801 --> 21:43.469
That maybe I couldn't
handle the fact

21:43.594 --> 21:45.387
that your dad and Tracy
have a child together,

21:45.512 --> 21:46.931
But that's not it.

21:47.056 --> 21:48.557
Something doesn't add up.

21:48.682 --> 21:52.895
It would break Dad's heart
if he knew how we felt.

21:53.020 --> 21:53.938
I know, but it would be worse

21:54.063 --> 21:56.149
if we were right
and we didn't act on it.

21:57.191 --> 22:00.569
So, what do we do?

22:08.995 --> 22:10.496
Nice speech.

22:10.621 --> 22:11.872
Yeah.

22:11.998 --> 22:16.043
Uh, listen, you and me,
we have such crazy history.

22:16.169 --> 22:18.378
Don't worry, I know you came
for Adrianna, not me.

22:18.504 --> 22:21.381
No, what I mean is...

22:21.507 --> 22:23.467
that history connects us.

22:23.592 --> 22:25.761
You know me better
than anyone else.

22:25.886 --> 22:26.804
I need that.

22:26.929 --> 22:28.597
Really?

22:28.722 --> 22:30.557
Yeah.

22:30.683 --> 22:34.270
I'm going through some
crazy stuff right now.

22:34.394 --> 22:35.855
Hey, guys, I wanted
to introduce you

22:35.980 --> 22:36.814
to my sponsor, Amy.

22:36.939 --> 22:38.732
Hey, I'm Brenda.

22:38.858 --> 22:39.942
Kelly. Nice to meet you.

22:40.067 --> 22:41.944
Glad you guys
could both make it.

22:42.069 --> 22:43.612
I actually want to introduce
them to Hank.

22:43.737 --> 22:44.738
Have you seen him anywhere?

22:44.864 --> 22:45.823
Oh, Ade, I thought you'd heard.

22:45.948 --> 22:47.783
Heard what?

22:47.908 --> 22:49.035
He found out he's HIV positive.

22:49.160 --> 22:51.411
He started
using again.

22:51.537 --> 22:53.622
I'm really sorry.

22:56.125 --> 22:57.251
Excuse me.

22:58.878 --> 23:01.421
I can't believe he relapsed.

23:01.547 --> 23:02.589
KELLY:
Who is Hank?

23:02.715 --> 23:03.590
Is that your boyfriend?

23:03.716 --> 23:04.633
No, he's...

23:04.758 --> 23:05.634
he's not my boyfriend.

23:07.094 --> 23:09.972
We slept together
a couple of times.

23:10.097 --> 23:12.016
Have you been tested?

23:12.141 --> 23:14.060
No.

23:14.185 --> 23:15.561
I'm fine.

23:15.686 --> 23:16.896
You need to get tested.

23:17.021 --> 23:18.731
We'll both go
with you, right?

23:18.856 --> 23:20.440
Right.

I'm glad you made it.
Me, too.

23:42.588 --> 23:43.797
Yeah, yeah.

23:43.923 --> 23:45.049
This is amazing.

23:45.174 --> 23:46.926
Um, was that Kobe inside?

23:47.051 --> 23:50.096
Yeah, if he's in town, he never
misses Daddy's barbecues.

23:50.221 --> 23:51.471
I got to be honest,

23:51.597 --> 23:54.100
I really didn't know
that there was this many

23:54.225 --> 23:55.351
black people
in Beverly Hills.

23:55.475 --> 23:56.643
Well, you just have to know
where to look.

23:56.769 --> 23:58.478
I guess you're right.

23:58.604 --> 24:00.064
Let me guess...
you're Dixon.

24:00.189 --> 24:01.523
Yes, sir.

24:01.648 --> 24:03.483
I'm Franklin Whitney,
Stina's father.

24:03.609 --> 24:04.651
I've heard a
lot about you,

24:04.777 --> 24:05.694
young man.
Oh.

24:05.819 --> 24:07.487
Well, uh, nice to meet you, sir.

24:07.613 --> 24:09.782
Stina tells me
you're into music.
Yes.

24:09.907 --> 24:11.075
She's, uh, put me on

24:11.200 --> 24:12.285
to a lot
of great stuff.

24:12.410 --> 24:13.493
You play an
instrument?
No,

24:13.619 --> 24:15.662
but I-I love to sing.
You any good?

24:15.788 --> 24:17.915
Um... (chuckles)

24:18.040 --> 24:20.251
I... uh, you know, I haven't had

24:20.376 --> 24:21.835
any complaints,
but then again,

24:21.961 --> 24:23.003
I mostly sing in the shower.

24:23.129 --> 24:24.797
(Franklin chuckling)

24:24.922 --> 24:26.673
Well, don't wait
to be discovered.

24:26.799 --> 24:28.634
If singing's what you love,
you make it happen.

24:28.759 --> 24:30.010
Yeah.

24:30.136 --> 24:31.929
Stina, baby, Dre's leaving,
and he wanted

24:32.054 --> 24:32.930
to say good-bye.

24:33.055 --> 24:34.098
Dr. Dre?

24:34.223 --> 24:36.350
PhD.
(Dixon laughing)

24:36.474 --> 24:37.893
Listen, don't be a
stranger, Dixon.

24:38.018 --> 24:39.770
Hope we'll see a lot
more of you, all right?

24:39.895 --> 24:41.855
Yes, sir.

24:41.981 --> 24:42.940
I'll be right back.

24:43.065 --> 24:44.066
All right.

♪ Let it shine, let it shine,
let it shine... ♪

24:54.243 --> 24:55.535
Okay...
HARRY:
Deb.

24:55.661 --> 24:56.578
Can we talk?

24:56.703 --> 24:58.122
Yeah, I think
we should.

24:58.247 --> 24:59.373
Give me a minute.

24:59.497 --> 25:00.874
Look, I've been doing
some research,

25:01.000 --> 25:03.794
and I think I found a way
we can take a second mortgage

25:03.919 --> 25:05.963
out on the house.
Harry, I went to see the
private investigator

25:06.088 --> 25:06.797
that found Sean.

25:06.922 --> 25:08.090
Okay.

25:08.215 --> 25:09.883
I'm sorry I went
behind your back,

25:10.009 --> 25:12.219
but we're in a pretty
unusual situation here,

25:12.345 --> 25:13.887
and I wanted to
get some answers.

25:14.013 --> 25:15.973
Did the P.I. have any answers?

25:16.098 --> 25:17.391
No...

25:17.515 --> 25:18.892
but, honey, doesn't
it strike you

25:19.018 --> 25:20.478
as odd that Sean shows up

25:20.602 --> 25:22.396
out of nowhere
and asks us for money?

25:22.520 --> 25:25.107
No, Tracy found him,
and he didn't ask us for money.

25:25.232 --> 25:26.650
We offered.

25:26.775 --> 25:27.943
Annie doesn't trust him.

25:28.068 --> 25:29.278
Look, that's...

25:29.403 --> 25:31.071
that's not about Sean.

25:31.197 --> 25:33.949
That is about Naomi.

25:34.074 --> 25:35.742
It's about Annie
being a teenager,

25:35.868 --> 25:36.743
and it is
about jealousy.

25:36.869 --> 25:38.078
We went through this with Dixon.

25:38.204 --> 25:39.913
Harry...
Look, sweetheart,

25:40.039 --> 25:43.417
I know that this has been
a big adjustment for everybody,

25:43.541 --> 25:46.462
but Sean is my son
and I owe him.

25:46.586 --> 25:48.172
Look, I know
how you feel-- I do--

25:48.297 --> 25:50.007
but I won't let you
pay down your guilt

25:50.132 --> 25:51.425
at the expense
of Annie and Dixon.

25:51.549 --> 25:53.093
Sean's as much my child
as Annie or Dixon.

25:53.219 --> 25:55.137
He's not my child.

25:56.930 --> 25:58.682
Okay.

25:58.807 --> 26:00.059
So, what does that mean?

26:00.184 --> 26:01.727
You saying that you don't care
about Sean?

26:01.852 --> 26:04.938
I don't feel the same way
about him that you do,

26:05.064 --> 26:06.982
and I think that you're
letting your guilt

26:07.107 --> 26:08.942
cloud your judgment.
My guilt?

26:09.068 --> 26:10.986
Yes, something's
not right here, Harry.

26:11.111 --> 26:12.612
(door opening)

26:12.738 --> 26:13.655
HARRY:
Sean.

26:15.282 --> 26:16.450
What happened?
You okay?

26:18.327 --> 26:19.745
The guys my
dad owed...

26:19.870 --> 26:20.954
they found me.

26:21.080 --> 26:22.039
I'm calling the cops.

26:22.164 --> 26:23.374
No, no, please.

26:23.499 --> 26:25.292
Look, these aren't
the kind of guys

26:25.418 --> 26:28.128
who let people call the cops
and get away with it.

26:28.254 --> 26:29.046
This isn't y'all's problem.

26:29.171 --> 26:30.756
I'm so sorry.

26:30.881 --> 26:33.300
I'll be gone in the morning.

26:33.426 --> 26:35.010
No, Sean...
It's the only way.

26:36.429 --> 26:38.722
HARRY:
We will get the
money somehow.

26:38.847 --> 26:40.307
Don't worry.
(door closing)

27:02.496 --> 27:04.331
(line ringing)

27:04.457 --> 27:06.875
MAN (on phone):
Al Elmore Investigations.

27:07.000 --> 27:08.294
Hello?

27:09.962 --> 27:11.422
Why do they always

27:11.547 --> 27:13.840
have the ugliest art
in waiting rooms?

27:13.966 --> 27:15.092
Right, and they're all the same.

27:15.217 --> 27:16.009
They must have a catalog.

27:17.261 --> 27:19.388
I am such an idiot.

27:19.513 --> 27:21.890
There was so
much I wanted

27:22.015 --> 27:24.810
to do with my life
now that I'm clean.

27:24.935 --> 27:25.936
Hey, listen to me.

27:26.061 --> 27:27.187
We don't know
anything yet.

27:27.313 --> 27:29.064
Adrianna Tate Duncan?

27:29.189 --> 27:31.108
Yes.

27:31.233 --> 27:32.985
Your HIV test is negative.

27:33.110 --> 27:34.278
Oh, my God!

27:34.403 --> 27:35.695
(Adrianna laughing)

27:35.821 --> 27:37.781
Oh, my God, that is
the best news ever.

27:37.906 --> 27:39.992
Thank you so much.

27:40.117 --> 27:41.285
Oh, my God.

27:41.410 --> 27:42.953
But there's
something else.

27:43.078 --> 27:44.371
What?

27:44.497 --> 27:45.998
When we ran your blood work,

27:46.123 --> 27:47.333
it turns out you're pregnant.

27:52.004 --> 27:53.422
No.

27:53.547 --> 27:55.299
You should see your gynecologist

27:55.424 --> 27:57.301
to discuss
your options.

28:00.554 --> 28:03.056
ADRIANNA:
I can't be pregnant.

28:03.182 --> 28:04.850
I'm only 16.

28:04.975 --> 28:06.893
Okay, look, I know you're
freaking out right now,

28:07.019 --> 28:08.312
but let's just
take this

28:08.437 --> 28:10.314
one step at a time,
right, Brenda?

28:10.439 --> 28:11.731
I have to go.
I'm sorry.

28:12.941 --> 28:13.859
Brenda.

28:15.402 --> 28:17.112
I can't tell
my mom.

28:17.237 --> 28:18.531
My mom's gonna
kill me.

28:18.656 --> 28:20.407
I will help you talk
to her, sweetie.

28:21.575 --> 28:24.119
I don't even know where Hank is.

28:24.244 --> 28:26.246
We will find him.

28:26.372 --> 28:28.165
He might not even be the father.

28:31.918 --> 28:34.838
I slept with a lot of guys
when I was using.

28:37.424 --> 28:39.468
What's Navid gonna think?

28:39.593 --> 28:41.094
He's gonna hate me.

28:41.220 --> 28:42.762
No.

28:42.888 --> 28:44.348
He's gonna totally hate me.

28:44.473 --> 28:46.766
This can't be
happening.

28:46.892 --> 28:49.228
This... no, this
isn't happening.
Shh.

28:49.353 --> 28:50.312
Come here, come here.

28:50.437 --> 28:51.438
It's gonna be okay.

28:51.564 --> 28:54.149
I can't take it.

28:55.359 --> 28:56.610
HARRY:
Uh-huh.

28:56.735 --> 28:59.112
All right, Tracy,
let's meet here in the morning

28:59.238 --> 29:01.781
and figure out how much
we can pull together.

29:01.907 --> 29:03.492
Yeah.
Dad...

29:03.617 --> 29:05.035
look, please listen to me.
Annie,

29:05.160 --> 29:06.119
I don't have time
for this right now.

29:06.245 --> 29:07.413
Mom, look.

29:07.538 --> 29:09.122
The last five calls
that Sean received

29:09.248 --> 29:11.458
was from Al Elmore,
the P.I.

29:11.584 --> 29:14.086
Why would they
be in touch?
Wait.

29:14.211 --> 29:16.213
What are you doing,
going through his things?

29:16.338 --> 29:17.506
First, you go
to a P.I.,

29:17.631 --> 29:19.258
then you invade a man's privacy.

29:19.383 --> 29:20.217
Annie, what's going on with you?

29:20.342 --> 29:21.968
I'm scared, Dad.

29:22.094 --> 29:24.597
I know how much
Sean means to you,

29:24.722 --> 29:25.931
and I'm really scared
that you're

29:26.056 --> 29:27.391
never gonna
forgive me for this,

29:27.516 --> 29:30.185
but I'm more scared
that something is not right.

29:30.310 --> 29:31.353
And you agree with her.

29:31.478 --> 29:33.397
We don't think Sean
is who he says he is.

29:33.522 --> 29:34.440
Give us
the same benefit

29:34.565 --> 29:36.275
of the doubt
that you're giving him.

29:36.400 --> 29:37.651
What do you want me to do?

29:37.776 --> 29:39.861
Ask him to take
a paternity test.

29:41.154 --> 29:42.155
Please?

29:45.367 --> 29:47.286
Sean is my son.

29:47.411 --> 29:48.412
I know it.

29:48.537 --> 29:50.539
I can feel it in my guts,

29:50.664 --> 29:52.458
in my bones,
but if that's

29:52.583 --> 29:55.210
what you need me to do...
I'll do it.

29:57.588 --> 29:59.339

30:15.689 --> 30:18.150
So, Daddy
really liked you.

30:18.275 --> 30:19.568
You should come
to dinner next week.

30:19.693 --> 30:21.069
(chuckling uneasily)

30:21.194 --> 30:22.321
Um...

30:22.446 --> 30:25.073
look, Christina,
you're amazing,

30:25.198 --> 30:29.077
and I'm very grateful
that you invited me here

30:29.202 --> 30:31.330
and introduced me to...

30:31.455 --> 30:33.248
this whole world...

30:33.373 --> 30:34.916
but... but...

30:35.041 --> 30:36.502
the thing is, I
have a girlfriend.

30:36.627 --> 30:37.586
I know.

30:37.711 --> 30:38.962
So do I.

30:39.087 --> 30:40.213
Wait, what?

30:40.339 --> 30:41.423
Tiffany.

30:41.548 --> 30:42.966
That cute soprano.

30:44.468 --> 30:45.594
Did you think

30:45.719 --> 30:47.179
I was making
a move on you?
No.

30:47.304 --> 30:49.014
No.

30:49.139 --> 30:51.308
I'm just surprised that...

30:51.433 --> 30:52.518
I've had boyfriends, too,

30:52.643 --> 30:54.520
but I'm not interested
in you in you that way.

30:54.645 --> 30:56.355
I just
invited you here

30:56.480 --> 30:58.190
'cause I thought
you'd like this.
No, no, no, I...

30:58.315 --> 30:59.566
I do, I...

30:59.692 --> 31:01.443
this is... this is amazing.

31:01.568 --> 31:02.944
Well, you're welcome anytime.

31:03.069 --> 31:03.987
Silver, too.

31:05.489 --> 31:06.657
If it wouldn't ruin
her street cred

31:06.782 --> 31:07.616
to hang out with a cheerleader.

31:07.741 --> 31:10.160
(chuckles)
No, not at all.

KELLY:
What the hell is wrong with you?

31:26.760 --> 31:28.595
How could you leave Adrianna
at the clinic like that?

31:28.721 --> 31:29.471
I mean, that's
pretty low,

31:29.596 --> 31:30.639
Brenda, even for you.

31:32.391 --> 31:35.519
Kel, I... I can't have kids.

31:36.562 --> 31:37.563
What?

31:38.856 --> 31:41.400
I had fibroids removed
a while ago,

31:41.525 --> 31:43.235
and there were
complications,

31:43.360 --> 31:46.279
and kids are not an option
for me.

31:48.365 --> 31:49.491
Wow.

31:49.616 --> 31:50.826
I'm sorry.

31:50.950 --> 31:53.078
You know, when I
first heard, I thought,

31:53.203 --> 31:54.496
it's not...

31:54.621 --> 31:57.624
the end of the world...

31:57.750 --> 31:59.084
but, then, somehow,

31:59.209 --> 32:01.002
when I heard
that Adrianna,

32:01.127 --> 32:04.423
who wasn't even trying

32:04.548 --> 32:06.007
and doesn't
even want it,

32:06.132 --> 32:08.134
is pregnant...

32:09.595 --> 32:10.804
I'm pathetic.

32:10.929 --> 32:12.389
I'm jealous
of a 16-year-old girl.

32:12.514 --> 32:14.600
You're not pathetic.

32:14.725 --> 32:15.934
You're a pain
in the ass,

32:16.059 --> 32:17.644
but you're not pathetic.
I didn't even know

32:17.770 --> 32:19.688
you wanted kids.
I didn't.

32:19.813 --> 32:23.358
I mean, I, I figured that I
would in the future, but...

32:23.483 --> 32:26.361
man, I hate it when people
tell me I can't do something.

32:26.486 --> 32:28.113
That's the Brenda
I know and love.

32:28.238 --> 32:30.866
You know, I didn't think
I could have kids either,

32:30.990 --> 32:33.535
but medicine is changing
all the time.

32:33.660 --> 32:36.079
I'm kind of ready now,

32:36.204 --> 32:37.664
so...

32:37.790 --> 32:39.958
I'm thinking of adopting.

32:41.209 --> 32:44.170
Bren... wow.

32:44.296 --> 32:45.631
I think that's a great idea.

32:45.756 --> 32:48.049
And I would really like
you in my life for that.

32:49.342 --> 32:51.720
I'm not going anywhere.

32:58.351 --> 33:02.188
(chuckling):
Hey... you made it.

33:02.314 --> 33:03.315
Cool party, huh?

33:03.440 --> 33:07.068
You want me to
introduce you to Denzel?

33:07.193 --> 33:09.655
Why would you lie
to me about this?

33:09.780 --> 33:11.156
Are you into Christina?

33:11.281 --> 33:13.700
No... Look,
I apologize.

33:13.826 --> 33:15.243
I shouldn't have
lied to you,

33:15.368 --> 33:17.579
and I'm not
into Christina

33:17.704 --> 33:20.248
and she's not into me.

33:20.373 --> 33:21.207
Trust me.

33:21.333 --> 33:22.668
But...

33:22.793 --> 33:24.377
I didn't know how to talk
to you about all of this.

33:24.503 --> 33:27.213
All what?

33:27.339 --> 33:29.341
This.

33:29.466 --> 33:30.884
I'm a black kid
in a white family,

33:31.009 --> 33:32.344
so there's
this whole other culture

33:32.469 --> 33:33.345
I have never experienced.

33:33.470 --> 33:35.347
Then Christina
came along

33:35.472 --> 33:38.767
and she's exposed me
to some really amazing things,

33:38.892 --> 33:41.854
but... I know you hate her.

33:41.979 --> 33:45.983
Okay... well, "hate"
is a very strong word.

33:46.107 --> 33:49.194
"Loathe" and "detest,"
yeah, maybe.

33:49.319 --> 33:50.946
(laughs)

33:51.070 --> 33:54.533
Look... you're the girl
I want to be with.

33:54.658 --> 33:57.285
All right?

33:57.410 --> 34:00.246
If you want me to end my
friendship with Christina...

34:00.372 --> 34:01.373
No.

34:01.498 --> 34:03.500
No.

34:03.625 --> 34:05.043
I guess the fact

34:05.168 --> 34:08.295
that she can do something
for you that I can't,

34:08.420 --> 34:09.464
well, it makes me
kind of jealous.

34:09.589 --> 34:10.841
(laughs)

34:10.966 --> 34:12.759
And that's so not
me and totally lame.

34:12.885 --> 34:13.844
No, no,

34:13.969 --> 34:15.344
actually,
I find it flattering.

34:17.263 --> 34:18.306
Okay.

34:18.431 --> 34:20.559
You just have to do
one thing for me.
All right,

34:20.684 --> 34:23.478
all right, I promise
I won't lie to you again.

34:23.603 --> 34:24.646
No.

34:24.771 --> 34:26.565
Introduce me to Denzel.

34:26.690 --> 34:28.734
(laughing):
All right, yeah,
he's right over there.

34:28.859 --> 34:30.443
Sean.

34:30.569 --> 34:32.237
Hey.

34:32.362 --> 34:33.237
How's the eye?

34:33.362 --> 34:34.406
Ah, it's okay.

34:34.531 --> 34:36.491
I come from hardy stock.

34:36.616 --> 34:38.534
We're going to get
that money together.

34:38.659 --> 34:41.746
Thank you, Harry, that's...
that's beyond generous.

34:41.871 --> 34:43.373
I'll pay you back,
I swear to you.

34:43.498 --> 34:44.750
Just one catch.

34:44.875 --> 34:49.379
Uh... I need you to take
a paternity test first.

34:49.504 --> 34:51.339
I'm sorry.

34:51.464 --> 34:53.341
Believe me, I know what the
results are going to be.

34:53.466 --> 34:54.967
(chuckles)

34:55.092 --> 34:57.094
Harry, please,
that's a lot of money.

34:57.220 --> 34:59.514
I'd ask the same thing
if I was in your shoes.

34:59.639 --> 35:00.599
Of course I'll do it.

35:00.724 --> 35:03.518
I knew you would.

35:03.643 --> 35:04.937
You know what?

35:05.062 --> 35:06.980
I am not going to let
anything happen to you.

35:08.857 --> 35:11.484
FRANKLIN:
Everybody,

35:11.610 --> 35:13.528
can I have your attention
for a minute?
(choir harmonizing)

35:13.653 --> 35:16.615
I'm so glad
you're all here.

35:16.740 --> 35:17.991
I'm reminded on these days

35:18.116 --> 35:19.826
of the many things
I have to be thankful for--

35:19.952 --> 35:21.286
my family,

35:21.411 --> 35:23.246
good friends,

35:23.371 --> 35:26.708
beautiful,
beautiful music.

35:26.833 --> 35:28.293
So please...

35:28.418 --> 35:29.878
join me and reflect

35:30.003 --> 35:32.756
on all the things you have to be
thankful for in your own lives.

35:32.881 --> 35:33.673
GUESTS:
Hear, hear.

35:33.799 --> 35:36.718

35:37.970 --> 35:40.472

"Amazing Grace"?

35:40.597 --> 35:42.557
Yeah. Why?

35:42.682 --> 35:44.935

35:45.978 --> 35:47.729

I was surprised Harry needed
that kind of proof,

36:39.781 --> 36:42.367

not everyone trusts me.

I thought you, Annie, out
of all people, would understand.

36:47.747 --> 36:50.208
Understand what?

36:50.333 --> 36:53.795
You moved from Kansas to this
perfect life in Beverly Hills.

36:53.920 --> 36:56.840
You just had it handed to you.

36:56.965 --> 36:58.550
Not everybody gets that chance.

36:58.675 --> 37:01.803
Not everyone gets to take
what isn't theirs, either.

37:06.850 --> 37:09.227
Good night, Annie.

Sean.

Hey.

He cleared his stuff out.

38:43.738 --> 38:45.657
What do you mean he's gone?

No joke.

Yeah, sure, whatever.
Come on.

Girls, if you need us,
we'll be in the kitchen.

Mmm, my favorite.

maybe we can take
something good from this.

right now, I mean,

40:11.993 --> 40:15.205
maybe me and you can
just finally call a truce.

How do you keep managing
to cause my family so much pain?

40:19.292 --> 40:20.710
Me?

40:20.835 --> 40:22.128
My mom had a son.

40:22.254 --> 40:24.130
I had a brother.

40:24.256 --> 40:25.131
He was not

40:25.257 --> 40:26.841
our brother.

40:26.966 --> 40:29.844
I mean, at least he left
before both our families

40:29.969 --> 40:31.888
were taken in by his scam.

Your family.

last night

40:36.268 --> 40:37.685
and Mom gave him the money.

Wait, what?

40:41.898 --> 40:43.149
I thought she didn't have it.

40:43.275 --> 40:45.151
She didn't have it, Annie.

40:45.277 --> 40:46.611
She called Dad

40:46.736 --> 40:49.697
and gave up some of her demands

40:49.822 --> 40:52.700
in the divorce so he
would give her the money,

40:52.825 --> 40:55.120
and she gave it to Sean.

40:56.162 --> 40:59.207
I... I am so sorry.

41:01.126 --> 41:02.961
I did not know.

This is your fault.

Hey, Dad.

I am so sorry.

41:21.729 --> 41:25.942
No, no, I'm sorry.

41:26.067 --> 41:27.235
I guess
I should have trusted you.

41:30.113 --> 41:32.573
Oh, Daddy.

41:32.698 --> 41:35.118
I never wanted you
to feel like this.

Oh... I know,
