00:16.642 --> 00:19.521
<i>The Incredible Hulk.</i>

00:19.603 --> 00:21.981
<i>Strength, invulnerability,</i>

00:22.064 --> 00:25.364
<i>and a temper that has
made him infamous.</i>

00:25.442 --> 00:29.788
<i>Created by the accidental exposure to
an exploding gamma bomb,</i>

00:29.863 --> 00:31.865
<i>the Hulk is, without question,</i>

00:31.949 --> 00:35.328
<i>the strongest being on Earth.</i>

00:35.661 --> 00:37.834
<i>The power coursing through
his raging body</i>

00:37.913 --> 00:40.757
<i>is exactly what we need.</i>

00:43.919 --> 00:45.546
<i>But that raging quality</i>

00:45.629 --> 00:49.930
<i>will not make it easy to
bring the Hulk in, Dr. Cruler.</i>

00:50.008 --> 00:52.010
<i>Which is why we've employed</i>

00:52.094 --> 00:54.142
<i>the Abomination.</i>

00:54.221 --> 00:56.315
<i>His exposure to gamma energy</i>

00:56.390 --> 00:58.939
<i>endowed him with not
only charming looks,</i>

00:59.184 --> 01:02.484
<i>but skin said to be stronger
than the Hulk's.</i>

01:02.646 --> 01:04.899
<i>I contest that the Abomination</i>

01:04.982 --> 01:08.327
<i>is just as powerful as his old enemy.</i>

01:08.860 --> 01:12.114
<i>I suppose we will soon test that theory,</i>

01:12.197 --> 01:14.291
<i>won't we, Dr. Fump?</i>

03:16.446 --> 03:17.948
Hey, fin head!

03:20.283 --> 03:21.580
Hulk...

03:22.619 --> 03:24.792
About time you showed up.

03:25.080 --> 03:27.833
Your ugly mug
scared off everyone, Abomination.

03:27.916 --> 03:29.793
But you don't scare me.

03:29.876 --> 03:31.378
Time for you to leave.

03:31.461 --> 03:35.056
That's no way to talk to
an old gamma-powered pal.

03:35.173 --> 03:39.178
I'm not leaving until
I crush you under my scaly fist!

03:39.594 --> 03:41.312
I was hoping you'd say that,

03:41.388 --> 03:43.482
so I can smash you out of town!

03:52.691 --> 03:54.568
I come here for peace and quiet.

03:54.651 --> 03:56.244
What are you doing here?

03:56.319 --> 03:59.163
Just came for the fresh mountain air.

03:59.489 --> 04:01.992
And some mass destruction!

04:16.839 --> 04:19.389
Good people of this town
don't deserve this.

04:19.468 --> 04:20.765
You're gonna pay.

04:33.440 --> 04:35.408
<i>Abomination, do you copy?</i>

04:35.484 --> 04:37.111
<i>Where is our specimen?</i>

04:37.194 --> 04:40.164
The Hulk just showed his big, ugly face.

04:40.238 --> 04:41.740
Give me five minutes.

04:47.662 --> 04:50.006
Better make that 10.

05:03.553 --> 05:05.976
<i>The Mark VI
Hyper velocity Iron Man Armor.</i>

05:06.056 --> 05:07.524
<i>Powered by an arc reactor,</i>

05:07.599 --> 05:10.773
<i>this suit features a gold
titanium composite shell,</i>

05:10.852 --> 05:12.479
<i>quad repulsor projectors,</i>

05:12.562 --> 05:14.735
<i>and various energy weapons
as built and worn by</i>

05:14.815 --> 05:16.943
<i>its prolific inventor, Tony Stark.</i>

05:18.151 --> 05:20.950
You forgot the part about how
I'm a billionaire philanthropist

05:21.029 --> 05:23.452
and ladies' man, you lousy scrap heap.

05:24.074 --> 05:26.452
<i>Insults are entirely unnecessary, sir.</i>

05:26.535 --> 05:29.584
<i>They neither motivate me with anger,
nor hurt my feelings.</i>

05:42.592 --> 05:44.219
You're no fun, Jarvis.

05:44.427 --> 05:48.182
<i>You did not program
my artificial intelligence for fun, sir.</i>

05:48.932 --> 05:52.436
Next system update,
I'm programming less backtalk.

05:59.109 --> 06:02.079
<i>Perhaps it is your armor
that needs a system update.</i>

06:02.153 --> 06:05.623
<i>This training exercise is
nearing its inevitable end.</i>

06:06.116 --> 06:08.039
Yeah, how do you figure?

06:15.792 --> 06:17.635
<i>I've completed my calculations.</i>

06:17.711 --> 06:19.213
<i>Your armor may be faster,</i>

06:19.296 --> 06:21.594
<i>but the Hulkbuster suit is far stronger.</i>

06:23.925 --> 06:25.472
<i>And, in a one-on-one battle,</i>

06:25.552 --> 06:28.647
<i>power overcomes speed
69% of the time.</i>

06:29.472 --> 06:33.397
Don't worry, my tech has overcome
worse odds than those before.

06:35.478 --> 06:36.980
<i>Not this time, sir.</i>

06:41.192 --> 06:43.160
<i>You are incapable of escape, sir.</i>

06:43.236 --> 06:44.328
<i>Please surrender.</i>

06:44.404 --> 06:45.576
Not this time.

06:45.655 --> 06:47.248
Charging the E.M.P.

06:56.416 --> 06:57.588
<i>Explosion.</i>

06:57.667 --> 06:59.169
<i>Technical difficulties.</i>

06:59.753 --> 07:02.597
<i>The Hulkbuster systems
have been immobilized.</i>

07:02.672 --> 07:04.720
I think you'll live, Jarvis.

07:04.799 --> 07:06.676
<i>Yes, if you say so, sir.</i>

07:07.218 --> 07:10.438
<i>Congratulations, your technology
did prove superior to...</i>

07:10.513 --> 07:12.311
<i>Well, your other technology.</i>

07:13.141 --> 07:16.270
Jarvis, nobody outsmarts me

07:16.353 --> 07:17.570
like me.

07:24.527 --> 07:26.154
You're making me mad,

07:26.237 --> 07:29.787
and the madder I get,
the stronger I get!

07:32.577 --> 07:35.251
And you get sloppy
when you're angry, too.

07:35.538 --> 07:38.041
Now, you listen to me.

07:38.124 --> 07:40.047
Here's how we're gonna do this...

07:45.590 --> 07:46.716
What, now?

07:47.759 --> 07:50.683
Couldn't hear you with
your mouth full of my fist.

08:03.400 --> 08:05.323
Maybe I overdid it.

08:08.238 --> 08:09.410
<i>'(GP-</i>

08:19.082 --> 08:21.301
All that fighting made me hungry.

08:21.751 --> 08:24.254
Then why don't you chew on this?

08:27.007 --> 08:29.180
Now that is home run.

08:41.104 --> 08:44.232
Now I'm hungry and mad.

08:46.568 --> 08:49.447
Robots'? Those war drones?

08:51.072 --> 08:53.871
Hydra. Got a feeling
it ain't a coincidence.

08:53.950 --> 08:56.419
This town is suddenly bad guy central.

08:57.537 --> 08:59.915
But I didn't have enough to smash.

09:13.887 --> 09:17.232
So cute. Sleeping like baby.

09:17.307 --> 09:19.275
That wasn't so hard after all.

09:20.518 --> 09:23.943
<i>Especially when you didn't
have to do the hardest part of the job.</i>

09:24.022 --> 09:26.445
Hey, I got him here.

09:27.317 --> 09:28.694
<i>Regardless,</i>

09:29.152 --> 09:31.871
<i>the cost of those war drones
is coming out of your pay.</i>

09:32.238 --> 09:35.333
<i>Now, the least you can do
is bring him inside.</i>

09:37.827 --> 09:40.125
I hate working for Hydra.

09:40.205 --> 09:41.377
<i>We heard that.</i>

09:47.295 --> 09:49.514
This place need dog catcher.

09:54.511 --> 09:56.354
Honey, I'm home.

10:03.103 --> 10:05.447
Stand down. Stand down!

10:05.522 --> 10:07.616
Dr. Cruler, the specimens.

10:07.690 --> 10:10.239
Our fuel supply has finally arrived.

10:11.945 --> 10:12.992
Excellent.

10:13.363 --> 10:16.333
The arc reactor
has completed its target phase.

10:16.741 --> 10:19.870
All right, you ghouls,
where's my reward?

10:20.578 --> 10:23.673
It's coming. We assure you.

10:23.748 --> 10:27.252
You can put the Hulk
in the fuel containment cell.

10:36.177 --> 10:38.020
What's the other one for?

10:39.389 --> 10:41.391
Why, you, of course.

10:50.733 --> 10:52.406
Put him in the other cell.

11:00.618 --> 11:03.337
I still don't believe
we have enough shielding, Dr. Cruler.

11:03.454 --> 11:06.458
My calculations are correct, Dr. Fump.

11:06.791 --> 11:10.796
The reactor core was built to
absorb enormous green energy.

11:11.337 --> 11:13.180
We had a deal!

11:13.506 --> 11:15.600
Brought you the Hulk!

11:15.925 --> 11:18.269
What do you want with me?

11:18.386 --> 11:21.105
Why, you're special, too.

11:21.431 --> 11:23.729
The rare gamma in you two monsters

11:23.850 --> 11:27.946
has the potential
to supercharge our new arc reactor.

11:28.855 --> 11:32.200
Thanks to you,
Hydra will have the power

11:32.275 --> 11:35.119
to create a weapon
capable of destroying

11:35.195 --> 11:37.618
all our enemies.

11:56.633 --> 11:58.556
Yes, the siphon is working.

11:59.135 --> 12:00.978
Prepare to charge the reactor coil.

12:01.054 --> 12:03.273
Prepared and standing by, Dr. Cruler.

12:04.641 --> 12:06.109
On my mark.

12:06.184 --> 12:07.276
Now.

12:26.704 --> 12:28.502
It's working. It's working!

12:28.748 --> 12:32.298
Energy levels have already
surpassed our expectations.

12:32.794 --> 12:35.092
It's more powerful than we imagined.

12:42.720 --> 12:44.688
No! We're losing containment.

12:46.891 --> 12:48.564
Is that a reactor?

12:48.643 --> 12:50.441
What are you eggheads doing?

12:50.520 --> 12:52.443
You're gonna cause a meltdown!

12:55.358 --> 12:56.359
He's right.

12:56.442 --> 12:58.115
We've got to power off, now!

13:01.823 --> 13:04.246
Fail-safe shutdown circuit isn't working!

13:05.702 --> 13:08.251
Impossible. The polarity has reversed.

13:08.621 --> 13:11.966
It's not generating electricity, it's,
it's draining it!

13:12.667 --> 13:14.135
From where?

13:14.836 --> 13:16.338
Everywhere!

13:21.134 --> 13:23.307
<i>Another suit of armor in need of repair.</i>

13:23.636 --> 13:25.263
<i>What a surprise.</i>

13:25.638 --> 13:28.141
Well, your sarcasm is working just fine.

13:28.224 --> 13:31.819
Why don't you make yourself useful
and check for emergency alerts?

13:33.104 --> 13:35.903
<i>Sir, there's been a power outage
you should be aware of.</i>

13:36.149 --> 13:38.117
There's blackouts all the time, Jarvis.

13:38.359 --> 13:39.781
The more energy people use up,

13:39.861 --> 13:41.738
the less there is to go around.

13:42.905 --> 13:46.125
<i>The source of this blackout triggered
your regional gamma energy monitors.</i>

13:46.242 --> 13:49.086
Gamma? Get me a satellite view.

13:52.749 --> 13:56.094
That power plant is emanating enough
gamma energy to wipe out the state.

13:56.753 --> 13:58.380
So, you were right.

13:58.463 --> 13:59.635
<i>Of course I am.</i>

13:59.714 --> 14:02.137
Yeah, you're right, but I built you,

14:02.383 --> 14:03.760
so that makes me righter.

14:03.843 --> 14:05.436
Put that in your next update.

14:13.061 --> 14:15.735
Hey, Jarvis,
you better pack up and follow me.

14:15.813 --> 14:18.862
I might need our radiation
containment gear when I get there.

14:18.941 --> 14:20.363
Cross your fingers I won't.

14:20.443 --> 14:22.036
<i>Virtual fingers crossed.</i>

14:22.862 --> 14:24.705
<i>I'll be right behind you, sir.</i>

15:11.953 --> 15:14.376
It's building to critical mass, Dr. Cruler!

15:14.455 --> 15:16.002
I've tried everything.

15:16.082 --> 15:18.176
There's no stopping it now, Dr. Fump.

15:18.251 --> 15:20.049
Don't give up, Dr. Cruler.

15:20.128 --> 15:21.971
Dummies! I told you so!

15:22.422 --> 15:23.674
Let's go.

15:24.549 --> 15:25.675
Sorry.

15:46.028 --> 15:47.746
Let's get you out of there.

15:51.033 --> 15:52.910
You'd do the same for me, right?

15:54.203 --> 15:55.580
Yeah, right.

16:45.046 --> 16:47.765
How... How are we still alive?

16:48.633 --> 16:50.761
Because there was no explosion.

16:51.344 --> 16:54.473
Then where did all that energy go?

16:54.555 --> 16:57.604
It must have imploded
back into the core.

17:04.732 --> 17:08.031
It almost looks alive.

17:12.573 --> 17:15.122
Do you realize what we have here?

17:15.284 --> 17:17.877
Yeah. A rather unfriendly pet

17:17.954 --> 17:20.924
comprised of 100 gigawatts of power.

17:21.624 --> 17:25.299
We also have a living energy weapon.

17:26.002 --> 17:27.300
We must capture it.

17:27.380 --> 17:31.305
I knew there was some reason
I enjoyed working with you, Dr. Cruler.

17:31.384 --> 17:33.853
I'll fetch the energy guns, Dr. Fump.

17:34.136 --> 17:35.729
Yes, and hurry.

17:49.986 --> 17:52.409
Still breathing, scale-face?

17:53.489 --> 17:55.162
Get off of me.

17:57.118 --> 17:59.746
Where are your manners, creep?
I just saved you.

18:00.997 --> 18:03.420
Well, aren't you the boy scout.

18:11.007 --> 18:13.009
Ought to get a badge for that.

18:16.512 --> 18:17.729
Hulk.

18:18.180 --> 18:20.649
I said, leave me alone.

18:29.650 --> 18:31.448
-Iron Man?
- Of course.

18:31.527 --> 18:34.326
Fly all the way over to
investigate a gamma surge,

18:34.405 --> 18:35.827
and what do I find?

18:35.906 --> 18:39.206
My favorite big, green anger problem.

18:41.579 --> 18:43.126
What do you want, Iron Man?

18:43.205 --> 18:46.004
And I didn't do anything. It was...

18:46.375 --> 18:49.675
it was the invisible man.

18:50.254 --> 18:51.471
Nuts.

18:56.218 --> 18:58.971
Hey, now.
Where do you think you're going?

18:59.055 --> 19:00.432
Get out of my way.

19:01.140 --> 19:03.484
Listen, Hulk, I know we're friends,

19:03.559 --> 19:05.653
but you need to relax, or I'm...

19:05.728 --> 19:07.355
Or nothing, Stark.

19:11.275 --> 19:12.993
That was just a tap.

19:13.069 --> 19:15.163
You gonna calm down so we can talk,

19:15.237 --> 19:17.410
or do I need to turn it up to 11?

19:17.865 --> 19:21.369
Maybe, after I turn
your armor into a soup can!

19:30.628 --> 19:32.676
You may be strong, but I can fly,

19:32.755 --> 19:35.099
shoot repulsor beams and, yeah,

19:35.174 --> 19:36.926
I own a flying fortress.

19:38.928 --> 19:41.602
Anything you do, I do better!

19:41.972 --> 19:44.145
Let's put that to the test, shall we?

19:49.605 --> 19:52.028
I can make loud noises, too.

20:14.296 --> 20:16.424
All those gadgets and doodads

20:16.507 --> 20:18.475
and still you're not so tough.

20:22.722 --> 20:24.520
I can do this all day, green.

20:27.643 --> 20:29.145
Too bad you can't fly.

20:30.646 --> 20:31.738
Too slow.

20:33.733 --> 20:34.950
Get down here!

20:35.651 --> 20:38.780
No thanks.
I can smell your Hulk breath from here.

20:50.708 --> 20:52.927
What? Nothing funny to say?

20:53.002 --> 20:55.004
Okay. I'll talk.

20:55.463 --> 20:59.434
You're always ready to blame the big,
green guy when things blow up,

20:59.508 --> 21:02.978
but I didn't even
cause the problem here, Hydra did.

21:03.053 --> 21:06.523
Hydra? Those guys are always
trying to take over the world.

21:06.682 --> 21:10.437
What would they want with a tiny
energy plant in nowhere-ville?

21:12.271 --> 21:15.650
Still registering
a lot of gamma energy inside the plant.

21:16.442 --> 21:18.194
Okay, okay, timeout.

21:22.031 --> 21:23.908
I said timeout.

21:23.991 --> 21:25.163
I heard you.

21:25.242 --> 21:28.462
Like I was saying,
my power and all the other power

21:28.537 --> 21:30.460
was drained into the plant.

21:30.539 --> 21:33.213
Why didn't you
just tell me that in the first place?

21:35.544 --> 21:36.761
I was trying.

21:36.837 --> 21:38.680
I wanna punch you right now.

21:42.343 --> 21:43.720
Hey. big green,

21:43.803 --> 21:47.307
why don't we ask
questions first this time? Smash later.

21:47.932 --> 21:49.275
You're one to talk.

21:51.644 --> 21:53.646
There it is. Blast it.

21:54.772 --> 21:57.195
It's just too fast and powerful.

21:57.525 --> 22:00.404
Quick, activate your grounding circuit.

22:06.742 --> 22:08.790
It discharged my energy gun.

22:23.092 --> 22:25.595
Okay, the spark ball's new.

22:26.095 --> 22:27.938
Jarvis, what are we dealing with?

22:29.265 --> 22:31.017
<i>I have no record of this energy,</i>

22:31.100 --> 22:34.730
<i>however, its composition
is consistent with a primitive life form.</i>

22:46.031 --> 22:48.125
Those things aren't flying on their own.

22:49.326 --> 22:51.545
These robots will be fun to break.

22:51.871 --> 22:53.714
I'll just pretend they're you.

22:58.127 --> 23:00.050
Yeah, well, good luck with that.

23:26.488 --> 23:27.990
Hear that roar?

23:28.198 --> 23:29.495
That's my stomach.

23:29.742 --> 23:31.995
You're getting in the way of me filling it.

23:55.684 --> 23:56.776
Back off.

24:12.368 --> 24:14.041
Looks like you could use a hand.

24:14.536 --> 24:17.005
I don't need a hand, chrome dome,
but I'll take a leg.

24:22.544 --> 24:24.262
Not what I had in mind.

24:25.756 --> 24:27.053
Works for me.

24:27.800 --> 24:29.894
Come closer, so I can smash you.

24:30.260 --> 24:31.432
Hulk, behind you.

24:31.512 --> 24:32.684
Be quiet.

24:37.726 --> 24:38.852
You're welcome.

24:44.566 --> 24:46.409
Looks like they got their act together.

24:46.485 --> 24:48.908
Don't worry, I'll take them apart.

24:57.538 --> 24:59.586
Do something, Stark!

24:59.748 --> 25:01.500
It's draining my power.

25:02.292 --> 25:04.340
Jarvis, charge the E.M.P.

25:04.670 --> 25:05.842
<i>fir?</i>

25:05.921 --> 25:08.390
<i>An electro-magnetic pulse
will release energy.</i>

25:08.465 --> 25:10.263
This creature feeds on energy.

25:10.592 --> 25:14.313
So, if we overfeed it,
maybe we can give it a stomach ache.

25:31.947 --> 25:33.745
So much for the spark ball.

25:34.158 --> 25:36.206
See? You do need me.

25:36.285 --> 25:39.084
It's true. You make a good club.

25:40.706 --> 25:43.004
Looks like those two
Hydra goons escaped.

25:43.459 --> 25:44.756
I'll find 'em.

25:47.171 --> 25:49.674
This reactor is based on my design.

25:49.965 --> 25:51.763
Of course, their big mistake,

25:51.842 --> 25:54.846
trying to power it with
the energy out of you.

25:54.928 --> 25:56.726
What's the matter with that?

25:56.805 --> 26:00.275
Gamma is a dangerous,
unpredictable energy source.

26:00.350 --> 26:01.852
Made me the man I am today.

26:01.935 --> 26:03.528
Exactly my point.

26:03.604 --> 26:05.732
<i>Sir, your facility has arrived.</i>

26:05.814 --> 26:08.988
Your timing is perfect, Jarvis.
We got a lot of work to do.

26:12.279 --> 26:15.249
Hulk, I'd say it was
nice seeing you again,

26:15.324 --> 26:17.326
but it really wasn't.

26:30.881 --> 26:33.009
Jarvis, the armor's acting up.

26:33.509 --> 26:35.432
<i>Shall I run a diagnostic?</i>

26:35.511 --> 26:36.888
Hold on.

26:39.556 --> 26:40.853
And we're back.

26:42.226 --> 26:43.773
You know what never glitches?

26:43.852 --> 26:44.944
<i>Fists.</i>

26:45.187 --> 26:47.281
Let me know when
your fists can do this.

26:49.733 --> 26:50.825
Jerk.

27:00.911 --> 27:03.039
Jarvis, clear your calendar.

27:03.664 --> 27:05.382
<i>At your service, sir.</i>

27:05.541 --> 27:06.633
First order of business,

27:06.708 --> 27:09.803
we use the ship's arc reactor to
get the power grid back online.

27:10.045 --> 27:12.264
At least we can light up
a few thousand homes.

27:12.339 --> 27:15.058
<i>Very good, sir.
Shall I employ the man-droids?</i>

27:15.134 --> 27:16.431
You read my mind.

27:16.510 --> 27:19.389
Have them salvage what they can
out of that reactor on the ground.

27:21.056 --> 27:22.524
Hulk is hungry!

27:22.891 --> 27:24.188
Great.

27:24.268 --> 27:26.566
So, where's the kitchen
in this flying cruise ship?

27:26.895 --> 27:29.523
You can have dessert
when you finish your chores.

27:29.606 --> 27:31.859
I need you to clear
the debris down there.

27:34.111 --> 27:37.365
The only thing I'm looking to clear is
the food out of your fridge.

27:39.241 --> 27:41.243
This is the fridge, right?

27:43.996 --> 27:48.422
No, it was part of the computer
systems that handle my security.

27:48.584 --> 27:49.881
Nice, Hulk.

27:49.960 --> 27:52.588
Hey, I can't help that
it looks like a fridge.

27:53.422 --> 27:55.174
Well, guess I'm outta here.

27:55.257 --> 27:57.680
Hulk, look.
You're supposed to be a hero.

27:58.093 --> 27:59.936
You can't be on the run,

28:00.179 --> 28:01.977
alone, all the time.

28:02.055 --> 28:06.060
Better than floating up here
in your iron castle, alone.

28:08.437 --> 28:10.906
Not the same thing. Trust me on that.

28:10.981 --> 28:13.860
I need time alone,
to invent, to build things.

28:13.942 --> 28:15.660
Next time, build a kitchen.

28:16.111 --> 28:17.829
Fine, if you're not gonna help,

28:17.905 --> 28:20.784
don't let the door hit you in your big,
green butt on the way out.

28:21.074 --> 28:25.500
Have fun cleaning up after Hydra.

28:27.664 --> 28:30.338
<i>Warning, computer systems
have been compromised.</i>

28:30.751 --> 28:32.048
No.

28:32.252 --> 28:33.720
<i>No, no, no.</i>

28:33.795 --> 28:35.968
Jarvis, shut down all the systems now.

28:36.465 --> 28:38.638
Jarvis! Shut them down now.

28:39.218 --> 28:43.223
<i>I'm sorry, sir.
I'm afraid I can't do that.</i>

28:43.305 --> 28:44.477
What?

28:55.609 --> 28:59.330
<i>Human creatures!</i>

29:00.405 --> 29:04.376
<i>I am Zzzax!</i>

29:04.743 --> 29:06.586
Nice one, bolts for brains.

29:06.662 --> 29:08.664
You let the spark ball in the machine.

29:11.333 --> 29:13.631
Hey, hey, it's not my fault.

29:13.710 --> 29:15.929
Tricky little zapper stowed away.

29:16.004 --> 29:19.178
Now it's teaching itself
at an exponential rate.

29:21.093 --> 29:24.597
<i>Zzzax must feed</i>

29:24.680 --> 29:27.058
<i>on energy!</i>

29:27.641 --> 29:31.362
<i>All energy!</i>

29:34.731 --> 29:37.735
Listen, sparky... Or Zix, Zzzax.

29:37.818 --> 29:39.195
Whatever your name is.

29:39.278 --> 29:41.201
Humans rely on energy, too,

29:41.280 --> 29:43.123
and we can't survive without it.

29:43.365 --> 29:47.290
<i>Humans not worthy.</i>

29:47.619 --> 29:52.045
<i>Humans waste energy.</i>

29:52.499 --> 29:55.218
We don't want to waste energy.

29:55.294 --> 29:58.173
We're trying to conserve, to get better.

29:58.255 --> 30:00.974
We've even created
renewable power sources.

30:01.049 --> 30:03.643
Now, come out of there,
like a good little spark,

30:03.719 --> 30:06.563
and I'll give you a couple of nine
volt batteries to chew on.

30:08.056 --> 30:09.933
Less talk, more smash.

30:10.017 --> 30:12.611
Hulk, wait, it'll just stow away
somewhere else!

30:14.021 --> 30:16.115
Like my armor. Shields up!

30:19.609 --> 30:20.735
Hulk, it's coming your way!

30:41.256 --> 30:42.428
<i>I see you.</i>

30:42.924 --> 30:44.926
<i>Gotta squash that spark fast.</i>

30:52.434 --> 30:57.406
<i>Humans not stop Zzzax!</i>

31:10.952 --> 31:13.501
Hulk, don't let that mandroid escape.

31:13.830 --> 31:16.800
This thing gets any more power,
it could end up unstoppable.

31:18.543 --> 31:20.966
Only I'm allowed to be unstoppable.

32:00.836 --> 32:03.840
Maybe I shouldn't
have built so many man-droids.

32:04.131 --> 32:05.348
You think?

32:20.021 --> 32:21.864
Stupid dome heads.

32:30.449 --> 32:31.871
How is this fair?

32:33.994 --> 32:35.211
Man.

32:40.542 --> 32:43.546
Hulk, could use a little smash
right about now.

32:43.628 --> 32:44.880
Smash your toys?

32:44.963 --> 32:46.931
You don't have to tell me twice.

33:00.520 --> 33:02.022
Puny robots.

33:02.105 --> 33:03.573
Hulk smash!

33:11.156 --> 33:12.578
Green, behind you.

33:25.420 --> 33:26.717
Stay cool, buddy.

33:26.796 --> 33:28.013
Only one left.

33:55.325 --> 33:59.375
<i>Need more power.</i>

34:09.880 --> 34:13.976
<i>Zzzax must feed.</i>

34:14.386 --> 34:16.514
Sparker's making me mad.

34:16.596 --> 34:18.643
Spark won't like me when I'm mad.

34:20.809 --> 34:22.607
Jarvis, you back online?

34:22.686 --> 34:24.984
<i>Bit of a job, sir, but right as rain now.</i>

34:25.063 --> 34:28.158
Zzzax is trying to get to my suits.
Defense mode now.

34:28.233 --> 34:29.780
<i>Working on it, sir.</i>

34:32.529 --> 34:34.327
Jarvis, seal them up.

34:44.958 --> 34:47.585
Last one. Get the last one, Jarvis.

34:51.172 --> 34:52.889
Man, it got into the Mark ll.

34:53.007 --> 34:55.101
That's, like, my third favorite suit.

34:55.342 --> 34:57.061
<i>This shell</i>

34:57.137 --> 34:59.981
<i>will serve Zzzax!</i>

35:00.348 --> 35:02.726
<i>Remote power down failed, sir.</i>

35:12.944 --> 35:14.946
I don't know
how many of these things you need,

35:15.030 --> 35:16.907
but one less ain't gonna matter.

35:36.551 --> 35:38.895
Get off me, you big, green ape!

35:41.389 --> 35:42.390
Thanks.

35:42.724 --> 35:45.603
I think you only broke two or three ribs.

35:45.935 --> 35:47.937
That thing can't get enough power.

35:48.021 --> 35:49.648
Gotta be going after the reactor.

35:50.231 --> 35:52.029
Can't you shut it down?

35:52.108 --> 35:55.157
<i>Shutting down the arc reactor would
also shut down the turbine engines,</i>

35:55.236 --> 35:58.490
<i>sending the entire craft
plummeting to imminent destruction.</i>

35:58.573 --> 36:01.167
Then lock it down, now.

36:01.660 --> 36:03.833
<i>Engaging arc reactor force fields.</i>

36:12.420 --> 36:14.047
I'll make a short cut.

36:30.480 --> 36:31.948
Do not let it past us.

36:55.296 --> 36:58.095
Iron Man, blast him!

36:58.633 --> 37:01.307
You know,
that suit's kind of a collector's item.

37:01.845 --> 37:03.222
Shellhead!

37:04.723 --> 37:06.521
All right, firing unibeam.

37:27.537 --> 37:28.959
Nice save, Hulk.

37:29.038 --> 37:31.257
If that thing would've
gotten into the reactor,

37:31.416 --> 37:33.043
we would have been in a world of hurt.

37:33.418 --> 37:35.261
I would've smashed us out of it.

37:35.336 --> 37:37.213
Wait. What's that sound?

37:39.132 --> 37:40.133
No!

37:43.178 --> 37:45.556
Jarvis, power down the reactor!

37:49.768 --> 37:51.020
I got this.

38:03.198 --> 38:04.700
What's it doing now?

38:08.703 --> 38:10.705
It's evolving.

38:11.080 --> 38:12.548
It's copying us.

38:13.875 --> 38:17.220
Which means we're probably
in deep trouble.

38:42.278 --> 38:43.700
Hey, electric breath!

38:44.572 --> 38:46.574
Let's see what you do with repulsors.

38:54.123 --> 38:56.342
You eat them, apparently.

38:58.586 --> 39:00.088
Zzzax

39:01.089 --> 39:02.887
destroy!

39:25.446 --> 39:27.949
Jarvis, tell me you got something.

39:30.326 --> 39:32.420
<i>The creature is pure energy.</i>

39:32.495 --> 39:34.623
<i>I'm afraid it has no weakness.</i>

39:35.248 --> 39:36.465
It must.

39:37.750 --> 39:40.128
Wait, what's this thing's frequency?

39:40.795 --> 39:43.639
<i>Zzzax's frequency is 96.2 megahertz.</i>

39:44.507 --> 39:45.554
I've got an idea.

39:45.633 --> 39:48.227
Retune the repulsors
to a matching modulation.

39:48.303 --> 39:51.603
It's time we kicked
that creep's high voltage butt.

40:22.378 --> 40:23.425
Iron Man!

40:34.599 --> 40:35.646
Jarvis?

40:35.725 --> 40:37.727
<i>Stark, you okay?</i>

40:37.810 --> 40:39.483
<i>Power at 12%, sir.</i>

40:39.562 --> 40:41.564
<i>Recommend immediate recharge.</i>

40:41.856 --> 40:43.358
Duly noted.

40:45.944 --> 40:47.787
Hulk! Here he comes.

40:50.615 --> 40:51.616
Hulk.

40:57.580 --> 40:58.752
Now,

40:59.666 --> 41:03.716
Zzzax destroys!

41:53.302 --> 41:54.724
Hulk, you...

41:56.097 --> 41:57.394
You Okay?

42:03.521 --> 42:06.195
Everything is dark.

42:06.524 --> 42:08.618
I can't see.

42:09.110 --> 42:12.535
It's okay.
It's only... It's only temporary, green.

42:12.613 --> 42:14.911
It's UV damage to your cornea.

42:15.366 --> 42:17.289
They call it welder's blindness.

42:17.660 --> 42:18.786
ME,

42:18.995 --> 42:21.043
my armor's leg servos are damaged.

42:21.414 --> 42:22.540
I can't move.

42:25.334 --> 42:27.132
Looks like we're in a cemetery.

42:28.671 --> 42:31.470
A creepy, disturbing cemetery.

42:32.592 --> 42:34.390
Good thing I don't believe in omens.

42:42.977 --> 42:44.820
Guess I spoke too soon?

42:53.780 --> 42:56.408
What's that smell?
What's going on, Stark?

42:56.616 --> 42:57.959
You're not missing much.

42:58.034 --> 43:01.629
We're just about to get eaten
by a few hungry something or others.

43:02.580 --> 43:04.173
Jarvis, what are we up against here?

43:04.832 --> 43:08.382
<i>Based on my scans, these creatures
appear to be the Wendigos, sir.</i>

43:09.295 --> 43:10.672
<i>A legendary cursed beast</i>

43:10.755 --> 43:12.849
<i>rumored to consume
anything in its path.</i>

43:13.800 --> 43:14.847
<i>No need to fret.</i>

43:14.926 --> 43:17.930
<i>The Wendigo tale
was created to frighten children.</i>

43:18.012 --> 43:20.060
<i>They do not actually exist.</i>

43:21.808 --> 43:23.105
That's not helping, Jarvis.

43:28.648 --> 43:29.865
Get behind me.

43:29.941 --> 43:31.989
I'm not exactly going anywhere.

43:52.547 --> 43:53.719
Hulk, duck!

44:01.973 --> 44:02.974
Punch,fight

44:14.694 --> 44:15.741
Behind you.

44:21.868 --> 44:23.040
Dodge, back!

44:25.955 --> 44:27.298
Where are you, Stark?

44:27.373 --> 44:29.592
Under your big, honking foot.

44:31.377 --> 44:34.301
You mind?
I'm not crazy about organ failure.

44:35.923 --> 44:37.391
Got an idea.

44:38.301 --> 44:39.848
You can be my eyes.

44:40.469 --> 44:42.392
I'm not a backpack, Hulk.

44:43.264 --> 44:44.766
All right, here they come.

44:45.266 --> 44:46.768
- From where?
- From everywhere.

44:54.275 --> 44:55.401
Hulk...

45:14.337 --> 45:17.887
Smash, left. Forward... No, duck!

45:18.841 --> 45:19.933
Big Uppercut.

45:22.136 --> 45:23.683
This is better than a video game.

45:24.931 --> 45:26.057
Help, Stark.

45:26.599 --> 45:28.647
Okay, okay. Grab, right.

45:36.984 --> 45:38.327
That's right.

45:38.402 --> 45:41.121
Good, good, just scream it all out.

45:43.991 --> 45:46.665
The Wendigos are gone?

45:47.578 --> 45:48.921
My armor scanners are down,

45:48.996 --> 45:51.840
but yeah, I think so.

45:52.250 --> 45:54.924
You know,
we don't make such a bad team,

45:55.002 --> 45:57.972
when we're not
smashing the snot out of each other.

45:59.465 --> 46:00.637
Maybe.

46:02.134 --> 46:04.853
Hold up. My facility's on the move.

46:05.388 --> 46:06.480
What's going on, Stark?

46:06.764 --> 46:09.392
Zzzax is pretty clever
for living electricity.

46:09.475 --> 46:11.853
He's positioning
the ship right over the power plant.

46:11.936 --> 46:13.563
His creation caused a blackout,

46:13.646 --> 46:15.740
so I figure he's going to use the plant

46:15.815 --> 46:20.446
to reach the power grid to somehow
suck up all the power he can,

46:20.528 --> 46:23.202
like a giant electric leech.

46:23.447 --> 46:25.700
But why not just come down?

46:26.117 --> 46:27.835
Drain it straight from the generator.

46:29.578 --> 46:32.297
Zzzax has to stay in the air.

46:32.373 --> 46:33.340
What?

46:33.416 --> 46:36.386
What happens to a lightning bolt
when it hits the ground?

46:36.794 --> 46:39.172
It hits the ground and loses its charge.

46:39.255 --> 46:40.677
Hulk, you're a genius.

46:40.756 --> 46:44.181
Or, well, definitely, you know,
smarter than you look.

46:44.260 --> 46:45.386
Yeah?

46:49.056 --> 46:51.775
But then again,
you'd kind of have to be.

46:51.851 --> 46:53.694
Don't make me step on you again.

46:55.229 --> 46:57.982
So, you got a plan, metal britches?

46:58.065 --> 46:59.942
I'm thinking, I'm thinking.

47:04.572 --> 47:06.415
We gotta get up there somehow.

47:07.408 --> 47:08.830
Can hear him buzzing.

47:08.909 --> 47:10.161
He's not far.

47:10.244 --> 47:13.248
You think you can Hulk-jump us
back up onto the ship?

47:14.206 --> 47:15.879
If you can be my eyes.

47:16.334 --> 47:17.586
Great.

47:19.920 --> 47:21.137
Easy, green.

47:21.922 --> 47:26.098
All right, we're gonna leap straight up
into the facility, you got me'?

47:26.719 --> 47:29.598
Angle yourself 40 degrees left.

47:30.014 --> 47:31.687
Forty degrees, what?

47:31.766 --> 47:34.861
Even if I wasn't blind, I wouldn't know
what you're talking about.

47:34.935 --> 47:36.278
Just turn left.

47:36.812 --> 47:37.984
A little more.

47:38.481 --> 47:41.109
That... No, too much. There you go.

47:41.192 --> 47:42.819
Okay, steady.

47:43.778 --> 47:44.995
Launch!

47:56.248 --> 47:58.296
Okay, all right.

47:58.584 --> 48:01.133
What do you say
we try that one more time?

48:14.308 --> 48:15.730
Close enough.

48:15.810 --> 48:19.485
You know those planes cost me
50 million bucks, right?

48:20.940 --> 48:22.066
They're not worth it.

48:22.149 --> 48:24.117
Now just tell me where to go.

48:24.902 --> 48:26.279
All right, all right.

48:26.695 --> 48:28.322
About 100 paces left.

48:30.825 --> 48:32.498
Your other left, genius.

48:33.869 --> 48:35.837
And try not to make a racket.

48:38.958 --> 48:41.427
You know, you're about
<i>as</i> stealthy as a T. rex.

48:45.423 --> 48:46.845
Little help.

48:48.342 --> 48:51.061
Okay, you're gonna want
to turn left up here,

48:51.429 --> 48:54.649
in three, two, one...

48:57.017 --> 48:58.985
Okay, I think we're finally here.

48:59.687 --> 49:02.281
It only took half the night,
but we made it.

49:02.356 --> 49:05.656
Yeah, next time, you get
zapped in the face and carry me.

49:05.734 --> 49:07.953
Okay, I get the point.

49:08.404 --> 49:10.406
All right, look, there's a cable to

49:10.489 --> 49:12.787
recharge my arc reactor with
beside you.

49:12.867 --> 49:16.622
You're gonna want to plug it into
the unibeam projector in my chest plate.

49:16.704 --> 49:17.876
That's my head.

49:17.955 --> 49:19.673
Lower, a little lower.

49:19.748 --> 49:21.466
Okay, I think you got it.

49:21.876 --> 49:23.173
Now go to the left.

49:23.794 --> 49:24.886
My left.

49:24.962 --> 49:27.056
Right. Okay, your left.

49:31.927 --> 49:33.850
I'm gonna slip into some work clothes.

49:33.929 --> 49:35.226
Just...

49:35.806 --> 49:37.558
Take it easy, Hulk.

49:38.726 --> 49:41.479
Stark, can you fix my eyes?

49:42.146 --> 49:43.648
I'll do my best, big guy.

49:44.064 --> 49:46.283
Just give me 30 seconds
to armor up, okay'?

50:54.343 --> 50:56.016
The Mark VII armor.

50:56.679 --> 50:57.851
What do you think, Hulk?

50:59.473 --> 51:01.146
Did you forget I can't see?

51:01.517 --> 51:04.145
Right. Well, I'm wearing a new suit.

51:04.645 --> 51:06.943
It's untested and probably a little buggy,

51:07.022 --> 51:09.741
but it's got better shields
to keep Zzzax out.

51:09.817 --> 51:11.740
Jarvis, you remodulate the repulsors?

51:12.361 --> 51:15.615
<i>All energy weapons
have been tuned to 96.2 megahertz,</i>

51:15.698 --> 51:17.746
<i>which will repel the
creature's frequency.</i>

51:17.825 --> 51:18.826
All right.

51:18.909 --> 51:22.413
Now it's time to fix you up, big green.
How's the vision?

51:23.998 --> 51:26.251
Everything's still kind of blurry.

51:26.333 --> 51:28.552
You're familiar with laser eye surgery?

51:28.627 --> 51:30.846
Now hold still. This won't hurt a bit.

51:30.921 --> 51:33.891
Easy as one, two...

51:34.883 --> 51:36.351
Hey!

51:37.678 --> 51:39.146
Eyes work good enough to see.

51:39.221 --> 51:40.848
I don't need a laser zapping them.

51:40.931 --> 51:42.433
I'm trying to help.

51:42.850 --> 51:45.979
Look, I know we got off on
the wrong foot today,

51:46.061 --> 51:49.486
with me blasting you and all,
but we've got to work together on this.

51:49.565 --> 51:50.782
<i>Comprehend??</i>

51:50.858 --> 51:53.281
This is bigger than both of us, Hulk.

51:54.069 --> 51:55.616
I know that, Stark.

51:55.696 --> 51:58.370
Thanks for trying to help.

51:58.449 --> 51:59.666
No problem.

51:59.742 --> 52:01.961
All right, so here's what
I figure's happening.

52:07.416 --> 52:10.636
Zzzax is gonna use my ship
like an antenna

52:10.711 --> 52:12.839
and drain all the power from Earth.

52:12.921 --> 52:14.514
We can't destroy the grid.

52:14.590 --> 52:16.718
We'll leave millions of people
in the dark.

52:16.800 --> 52:20.555
But we can bring Zzzax down
and ground him

52:21.347 --> 52:23.395
if we take out my ship.

52:23.849 --> 52:25.647
Crash your iron castle?

52:25.726 --> 52:26.978
I like it.

52:27.061 --> 52:29.155
So, what are we waiting for?
Let's get smashing.

52:29.229 --> 52:31.072
Hold up, Hulk.

52:31.148 --> 52:33.651
You want sparky to
zap your eyes again?

52:33.734 --> 52:35.532
We need to insulate you somehow.

52:36.820 --> 52:40.666
You got something Zzzax can't fry
in my size?

52:40.949 --> 52:44.453
I think we do, with a little tailoring.

52:50.125 --> 52:53.220
I named it the Hulkbuster, after you.

52:53.712 --> 52:55.464
Well, what do you think?

54:04.074 --> 54:10.923
Zzzax consume all!

54:10.998 --> 54:12.591
Consume this!

54:20.966 --> 54:22.513
I don't think so.

54:30.642 --> 54:31.689
Smash?

54:31.769 --> 54:32.861
Smash.

54:39.318 --> 54:40.945
Stupid gizmo!

54:41.820 --> 54:43.538
Easy there, cowboy.

54:43.697 --> 54:45.199
Gotta steady yourself.

54:55.501 --> 54:59.051
Not as good as smashing,
but not bad either.

55:06.178 --> 55:09.648
Let's see you drain Earth dry
when I bring down your condenser.

55:21.610 --> 55:22.657
Shields.

55:22.736 --> 55:24.784
Sparky doesn't miss a thing.

55:25.906 --> 55:29.160
Humans inferior!

55:29.618 --> 55:33.623
Zzzax superior!

55:49.012 --> 55:51.811
He's tricky for living lightning,
I'll give him that.

55:59.022 --> 56:00.990
Hulk, use your gauntlets.

56:01.066 --> 56:03.160
Smash him back to sparksville.

56:03.235 --> 56:04.202
How?

56:04.278 --> 56:08.658
Your gauntlets are tuned with the same
frequency as Zzzax, so punch away.

56:10.242 --> 56:11.789
With pleasure.

56:18.292 --> 56:21.136
Finally, time for some Hulk smash.

56:30.387 --> 56:32.014
Keep it up, mean green.

56:32.097 --> 56:33.644
I'll take out the turbines.

56:46.570 --> 56:47.992
Full power to unibeam.

57:13.931 --> 57:15.308
One down.

57:16.016 --> 57:18.189
<i>Unibeam recharge in 90 seconds.</i>

57:18.310 --> 57:20.153
Speed up the process, Jarvis.

57:21.271 --> 57:23.865
<i>Redirecting power from
the repulsors now, sir.</i>

57:26.735 --> 57:29.158
I'm gonna go check on big green,
see how he's doing.

57:38.330 --> 57:41.425
Quit standing around
and crash this thing, Stark!

57:41.541 --> 57:42.884
I'm working on it!

57:43.543 --> 57:46.717
None may stop Zzzax!

57:51.009 --> 57:52.852
How we doing on that unibeam?

57:52.928 --> 57:54.100
<i>Thirty seconds, sir.</i>

57:55.389 --> 57:59.644
Humans are all parasites!

58:14.825 --> 58:16.418
Turn my ship against me?

58:23.709 --> 58:27.759
<i>All threats eliminated,
and the unibeam is back online, sir.</i>

58:30.549 --> 58:33.098
<i>My mistake, sir.
More missiles incoming.</i>

58:35.971 --> 58:39.225
Outsmarted by a 50-foot ball of static.

59:13.508 --> 59:15.636
That's cutting you down to size.

59:25.687 --> 59:27.314
Stupid bolt!

59:37.282 --> 59:39.751
Is that all you've got, sparky?

59:47.667 --> 59:50.170
Hang on, Jarvis, we're going in.

59:55.550 --> 59:57.678
<i>But, sir, all weapons are targeting us.</i>

59:57.928 --> 01:00:01.273
I know, but we've gotta
take out that second turbine.

01:00:09.397 --> 01:00:10.614
That's it.

01:00:10.690 --> 01:00:13.489
That's it. Just a little closer.

01:00:49.855 --> 01:00:52.574
Two turbines down, one to go.

01:00:55.318 --> 01:00:57.195
<i>Sir, I feel compelled to remind you...</i>

01:00:57.279 --> 01:00:59.202
That there's still a missile chasing us?

01:00:59.447 --> 01:01:01.495
I know. I'm gonna use it.

01:01:05.245 --> 01:01:06.667
<i>The odds of this risky maneuver</i>

01:01:06.746 --> 01:01:09.795
<i>successfully working
a second time are extremely low.</i>

01:01:10.417 --> 01:01:13.091
I told you, Jarvis,
I always beat the odds.

01:01:36.943 --> 01:01:40.618
And there's Zzzax,
frying off Hulk's face again.

01:01:41.865 --> 01:01:43.333
Time to shut off the power.

01:01:45.076 --> 01:01:46.328
Hey, sparky.

01:01:47.287 --> 01:01:49.585
You didn't pay your electric bill.

01:01:53.168 --> 01:01:54.761
<i>No!</i>

01:01:55.212 --> 01:01:56.304
Yes!

01:02:04.471 --> 01:02:05.688
What have we gotta do?

01:02:07.015 --> 01:02:08.483
We're going down.

01:02:13.813 --> 01:02:15.861
Hulk, we're gonna <i>smash</i> into the dam.

01:02:15.982 --> 01:02:17.484
You gotta turn this thing.

01:02:18.735 --> 01:02:19.987
I'm on it.

01:02:34.960 --> 01:02:37.008
Not what I had in mind, Hulk.

01:02:37.671 --> 01:02:39.048
How we doing, Jarvis?

01:02:39.381 --> 01:02:42.180
<i>Sir, the facility's
trajectory has changed.</i>

01:02:42.342 --> 01:02:44.686
<i>The dam is safe,
but the ship will be destroyed.</i>

01:02:45.595 --> 01:02:47.142
I can live with that.

01:03:23.216 --> 01:03:24.559
There's my green pal.

01:03:26.094 --> 01:03:27.437
You Okay?

01:03:32.183 --> 01:03:34.857
We get him? Zzzax finally gone?

01:03:35.312 --> 01:03:36.905
Maybe. I don't know.

01:03:40.442 --> 01:03:41.659
We gotta find him.

01:03:44.070 --> 01:03:46.869
That thing needs
to constantly feed on energy.

01:03:52.120 --> 01:03:53.246
Hear that?

01:03:56.833 --> 01:03:58.005
What's this?

01:03:58.752 --> 01:04:00.129
Hulk, get away from there.

01:04:00.754 --> 01:04:01.880
Gotcha.

01:04:13.892 --> 01:04:15.269
Stop him.

01:04:16.478 --> 01:04:17.695
Zzzax!

01:04:20.940 --> 01:04:22.863
You're grounded.

01:04:40.502 --> 01:04:41.719
Hulk!

01:04:41.795 --> 01:04:44.423
I got him, Iron Man. Stay back!

01:04:50.762 --> 01:04:52.309
Yeah, right.

01:05:38.768 --> 01:05:39.860
Hulk!

01:05:46.234 --> 01:05:48.532
Zzzax...

01:05:56.661 --> 01:05:58.379
Hulk, are you...

01:06:01.458 --> 01:06:03.881
I'm okay, Iron Man.

01:06:03.960 --> 01:06:05.883
Been through a lot worse.

01:06:11.050 --> 01:06:13.052
Lights out for spark man?

01:06:13.928 --> 01:06:17.728
Hulk, that was the stupidest, craziest,

01:06:17.807 --> 01:06:20.902
bravest thing I've ever seen anyone do.

01:06:32.614 --> 01:06:34.412
The town is still dark.

01:06:35.408 --> 01:06:36.534
Not for long.

01:06:36.618 --> 01:06:40.168
I'm gonna power the entire seaboard
with green Stark reactors.

01:06:40.246 --> 01:06:42.715
At least until this mess
is straightened out.

01:06:42.790 --> 01:06:44.758
Free of charge from Stark Industries.

01:06:45.585 --> 01:06:47.963
Jarvis, ship out a dozen mobile facilities

01:06:48.046 --> 01:06:50.299
to key locations
throughout the tri-state area.

01:06:50.381 --> 01:06:52.679
<i>Anything else I can attend to
while you relax?</i>

01:06:53.009 --> 01:06:55.182
No. I'm good.

01:06:55.261 --> 01:06:58.231
Hulk? You need anything, big guy?

01:06:58.389 --> 01:07:00.517
Well, since you asked...

01:07:00.600 --> 01:07:02.773
Look, I know what you're gonna say.

01:07:02.852 --> 01:07:07.358
Teaming up with you made me realize
I can't always rely on tech.

01:07:07.440 --> 01:07:10.034
No, I was gonna say, I need...

01:07:10.109 --> 01:07:13.204
To be alone. I know.
You say it all the time.

01:07:13.279 --> 01:07:15.577
But you also need
to keep in touch, okay?

01:07:15.657 --> 01:07:18.957
Any time you need a friend,
big guy, I'm here.

01:07:21.871 --> 01:07:23.418
Why are you staring at me like that?

01:07:23.623 --> 01:07:27.048
'Cause you never listen!

01:07:27.126 --> 01:07:29.220
I've been trying to say I'm hungry.

01:07:29.295 --> 01:07:31.093
I want food.

01:07:33.466 --> 01:07:34.809
Right.

01:07:34.884 --> 01:07:37.763
Well, I know this little diner
30 miles down the road.

01:07:37.845 --> 01:07:39.643
Best cherry pie in the state.

01:07:40.515 --> 01:07:42.609
Best idea you had all night.

01:07:42.684 --> 01:07:44.311
Last one there pays the check.

01:07:45.305 --> 01:07:51.588
