01:08.350 --> 01:10.550
Huh. A-ha!
Now I gotcha!

01:10.590 --> 01:12.350
Too late and too slow!

01:12.390 --> 01:14.160
Oh, yeah?

01:14.190 --> 01:15.390
<i> Zuka Zama!</i>

01:15.430 --> 01:18.460
Oof! Hey!
The baobab fruit's mine!

01:19.500 --> 01:21.160
Nuh-uh!

01:21.200 --> 01:22.300
Ha-ha!

01:22.330 --> 01:24.300
Winner, winner!
Zebra dinner!

01:24.330 --> 01:25.500
<i>Hyena in the Pride Lands!</i>

01:25.540 --> 01:27.470
Hyena in the Pride Lands!

01:28.640 --> 01:30.570
Hyena in the Pride Lands?

01:30.610 --> 01:32.310
All right, hyena!

01:32.340 --> 01:35.440
You picked the wrong day
to come into the Pride Lands!

01:36.380 --> 01:38.610
That's right!
And I'm gonna...

01:38.650 --> 01:41.220
- Hey. Bunga.
- Wait.

01:41.250 --> 01:44.064
You're not from Janja's clan.
You're the hyena

01:44.099 --> 01:46.420
that helped Kion when he
was trapped in the Outlands!

01:46.760 --> 01:49.220
Well, we helped each other out.

01:49.260 --> 01:51.530
Jasiri? What are you doing
in the Pride Lands?

01:51.560 --> 01:54.560
Looking for you.
I have a problem back home.

01:54.600 --> 01:56.400
And I need your help.

01:56.430 --> 01:58.370
Is it Janja and his hyenas?

01:58.400 --> 02:01.370
No.
Actually, it's lions.

02:01.400 --> 02:04.688
- Lions? In the Outlands?
- That's right.

02:04.723 --> 02:07.210
They've taken over my
family's watering hole.

02:07.240 --> 02:08.340
And they won't share it.

02:08.380 --> 02:10.550
But there shouldn't be
any lions in the Outlands.

02:10.580 --> 02:13.250
You sure they're lions, Jasiri?

02:13.280 --> 02:16.180
I know what lions look like, Bunga.

02:16.220 --> 02:19.490
Okay. Well, I'd be happy
to talk to them, Jasiri.

02:19.520 --> 02:21.460
Maybe they're lost
or something.

02:21.490 --> 02:24.330
<i> Asante, Kion.
Thank you.</i>

02:24.360 --> 02:26.230
Bunga, go back to the Lair.

02:26.260 --> 02:29.360
Let the rest of the Guard know I'm
going to the Outlands with Jasiri.

02:29.400 --> 02:31.270
Okay. We'll meet up
with you there.

02:31.300 --> 02:33.470
No need.
I should be right back.

02:33.500 --> 02:36.140
These are lions after all.

02:36.170 --> 02:38.340
It's probably
just a misunderstanding.

02:38.380 --> 02:40.510
Oh, I sure hope so.

02:40.540 --> 02:42.610
Lead the way, Jasiri.

02:42.650 --> 02:45.580
See ya!
Oh, and by the way...

02:45.620 --> 02:48.180
I win! Ha-ha!

02:52.190 --> 02:55.620
You know Kion, I was kinda
worried you might not help me.

02:55.660 --> 02:57.260
Why wouldn't I?

02:57.290 --> 02:59.686
- We've helped each other before.
- That was different.

02:59.721 --> 03:02.300
Last time the bad guys were hyenas.

03:02.330 --> 03:04.170
This time they're lions.

03:04.200 --> 03:08.200
They probably don't realize there
are good hyenas in the Outlands.

03:08.240 --> 03:10.140
I had that problem
at first, too.

03:10.170 --> 03:11.510
That's true.

03:11.540 --> 03:14.510
It did take a while for us
to trust each other.

03:18.580 --> 03:21.350
Jasiri, you're back!

03:21.380 --> 03:23.350
Whoa!
You weren't kidding.

03:23.390 --> 03:25.520
You really are friends
with a lion!

03:25.560 --> 03:28.260
Kion,
this is my sister, Madoa.

03:28.290 --> 03:29.420
Nice to meet you, Madoa.

03:29.460 --> 03:31.590
Uh, yeah.
You too.

03:34.260 --> 03:35.530
Hey there, little guys!

03:35.570 --> 03:37.330
Don't be afraid of me.

03:37.370 --> 03:40.500
You can't blame 'em.
All they know are bad lions.

03:40.540 --> 03:43.240
Like the ones who stole
our watering hole.

03:43.270 --> 03:44.610
Well, that's why I'm here.

03:44.640 --> 03:47.240
I don't know why those
lions are in the Outlands.

03:47.280 --> 03:49.340
But I'm sure
I can clear things up.

03:49.380 --> 03:52.350
I hope so. Those little
ones need the water.

03:52.380 --> 03:53.550
We all do.

03:53.580 --> 03:55.420
Then there's
no time to lose.

03:55.450 --> 03:57.390
Let's go, Jasiri!

03:57.420 --> 04:01.460
- ...and with all the flooding, we now have...
- Hey, guys. Guys!

04:01.490 --> 04:03.420
You're back just in time.

04:03.460 --> 04:05.430
Ono and Fuli are
about to race!

04:05.460 --> 04:07.200
What? Again?

04:07.230 --> 04:10.230
Affirmative.
But this time, I'm going to win.

04:10.270 --> 04:12.200
You say that every time.

04:13.240 --> 04:15.300
- Ready?
- Ready.

04:15.340 --> 04:18.209
- Bunga?
- Oh, right. I'll be the ref!

04:19.480 --> 04:21.209
On your marks...

04:22.310 --> 04:23.440
Get set...

04:25.150 --> 04:26.480
Go!

04:26.520 --> 04:28.250
And they're off!

04:29.290 --> 04:31.350
It's Fuli in the lead!

04:32.460 --> 04:34.560
I'm right on your tail, Fuli!

04:34.590 --> 04:37.130
That's what you think.

04:37.160 --> 04:38.330
<i> Huwezi!</i>

04:39.560 --> 04:41.330
Oh, no.

04:41.360 --> 04:43.160
And the winner is...

04:43.200 --> 04:44.530
Fuli!

04:48.440 --> 04:49.600
Nice race.

04:49.640 --> 04:51.340
Yeah, do it again.

04:51.370 --> 04:53.540
You almost had her that time.

04:53.580 --> 04:57.150
It was close, wasn't it?
Hmm.

04:57.180 --> 05:00.180
Maybe if I flatten my head
feathers to reduce the drag,

05:00.220 --> 05:02.150
and stay closer
to Fuli's tail

05:02.190 --> 05:04.250
to take advantage
of her slipstream...

05:04.290 --> 05:06.220
Drag? Slipstream?

05:06.260 --> 05:07.420
Wha'cha talking about, Ono?

05:07.460 --> 05:09.260
I'm talking about winning!

05:12.530 --> 05:14.460
Lions are pretty reasonable.

05:14.500 --> 05:18.130
Once we get to the watering hole,
I'm sure we can work things...

05:19.270 --> 05:21.370
We told you
to stay outta here, hyena!

05:21.400 --> 05:24.410
Hey!
Back off!

05:25.510 --> 05:28.280
- Huh! Who are you?
- Name's Kion.

05:28.310 --> 05:30.380
- Who are you?
- Nuka!

05:30.410 --> 05:34.480
- Hey, Nuka!
- Kovu! Tell him to let me up!

05:34.520 --> 05:36.480
A friend of yours?

05:36.520 --> 05:38.250
He's my brother.

05:38.290 --> 05:41.290
That's right!
So you better let me up!

05:41.320 --> 05:43.120
It's two against one now!

05:43.160 --> 05:45.460
It's two against two.

05:45.500 --> 05:47.530
It should be three against one!

05:47.560 --> 05:51.470
What kind of lion are you?
Siding with a hyena!

05:51.500 --> 05:54.370
<i> What are you two
lions doing in the Outlands?</i>

05:54.400 --> 05:56.400
Why aren't you
in the Pride Lands?

05:56.440 --> 05:58.270
Like our family's
welcome there!

05:58.310 --> 05:59.610
Why wouldn't you be?

05:59.640 --> 06:02.080
I'm sure my dad
would welcome you there.

06:02.110 --> 06:04.280
And who's your dad?

06:04.310 --> 06:07.520
You know,
the king of the Pride Lands.

06:07.550 --> 06:09.150
Simba?

06:09.190 --> 06:10.380
<i> Simba?</i>

06:10.420 --> 06:12.420
You really think he'd allow
us into the Pride Lands?

06:12.460 --> 06:14.320
I don't see why not.

06:14.360 --> 06:17.530
Especially if you give Jasiri's
family their watering hole back.

06:17.560 --> 06:19.430
Back to the Pride Lands.

06:19.460 --> 06:21.300
That means I could
see Kiara again!

06:21.330 --> 06:23.230
You know Kiara?

06:23.270 --> 06:25.500
Yeah!
Uh, it was a while ago.

06:25.540 --> 06:27.340
We gotta take him
to see Mom.

06:27.370 --> 06:28.470
Oh, yeah!

06:28.510 --> 06:30.570
She's gonna want to meet
the son of Simba.

06:31.440 --> 06:33.340
The name's Kion.

06:33.380 --> 06:35.340
Okay. Kion.

06:36.180 --> 06:37.580
Hyena. Let's go.

06:39.280 --> 06:41.320
C'mon, Jasiri.
You'll see.

06:41.350 --> 06:44.520
This whole watering hole thing's
gotta be a misunderstanding.

06:48.420 --> 06:51.590
Mother!
We have a visitor!

06:51.630 --> 06:55.600
- It's Simba's son. Kion.
- Simba's son?

06:55.630 --> 06:59.400
Well, what an honor.

06:59.440 --> 07:02.170
He pounced on me!

07:02.210 --> 07:06.340
- I'm sure you pounced first.
- Well, yeah.

07:06.380 --> 07:09.380
Welcome, Kion.
I'm Zira.

07:09.410 --> 07:12.299
And this my daughter, Vitani.

07:12.550 --> 07:16.150
A lion and a hyena?
Hmm.

07:16.190 --> 07:20.220
Not just any lion, dear.
Simba's son.

07:20.260 --> 07:25.130
So tell me, Kion.
What brings you to the Outlands?

07:25.160 --> 07:27.260
I did!
We're friends.

07:27.300 --> 07:29.560
Friends with royalty?

07:29.600 --> 07:33.330
Gracious!
I underestimated you, my dear.

07:33.370 --> 07:36.170
Kion's not just royalty!

07:36.210 --> 07:38.310
He's leader
of the Lion Guard!

07:38.340 --> 07:40.410
Leader of the Lion Guard?

07:40.440 --> 07:42.510
But the Guard isn't here.

07:42.550 --> 07:45.310
No. But I am.

07:45.350 --> 07:47.320
Now, what are you doing
in the Outlands?

07:47.350 --> 07:50.180
And why have you taken over
Jasiri's watering hole?

07:51.490 --> 07:54.260
So many questions, Kion.

07:55.260 --> 07:58.395
What I don't understand
is why you don't just use

07:58.396 --> 08:01.530
the Roar to give your
friend the water she needs.

08:01.560 --> 08:03.260
- What?
- You can do that?

08:03.300 --> 08:05.200
- What are you talking about?
- Mom?

08:05.230 --> 08:07.400
As leader of the Lion Guard,

08:07.440 --> 08:10.540
Kion possesses a special power.

08:10.570 --> 08:14.510
The Roar of the Elders.
Isn't that right?

08:14.540 --> 08:17.240
Yeah. How do you know?

08:17.280 --> 08:21.150
Oh, I know
all about the Roar.

08:21.180 --> 08:23.320
You see that little cloud?

08:24.190 --> 08:26.290
Try roaring at it.

08:26.320 --> 08:28.420
Roar at the cloud?

08:28.460 --> 08:30.390
What's wrong, Kion?

08:30.430 --> 08:33.289
I thought you wanted to
help your hyena friend.

08:33.330 --> 08:36.460
I don't see how roaring at
a cloud is gonna do that.

08:36.500 --> 08:37.470
<i> Kion?</i>

08:38.600 --> 08:41.470
Well, I guess
it won't hurt to try.

08:53.350 --> 08:54.380
Whoa!

09:00.420 --> 09:03.160
Kion, did you know
you could do that?

09:03.190 --> 09:05.430
No. I didn't.

09:05.460 --> 09:08.500
Zira. How did you know
the Roar could do that?

09:08.530 --> 09:11.500
Oh. I'd love to tell you.

09:11.530 --> 09:16.370
But I feel a little
uncomfortable discussing the Roar,

09:16.410 --> 09:20.240
- in front of a hyena.
- Oh, don't mind me.

09:20.280 --> 09:22.310
I just want
my watering hole back!

09:22.350 --> 09:25.410
Perhaps we can go
somewhere more private.

09:25.450 --> 09:27.150
And talk...

09:27.180 --> 09:29.320
Lion to lion.

09:31.120 --> 09:33.150
I don't trust her, Kion.

09:33.190 --> 09:36.390
I know. But she knows more
about the Roar than I do!

09:36.430 --> 09:38.530
Besides, maybe I can
get her to agree

09:38.560 --> 09:40.130
to share the watering hole.

09:40.160 --> 09:41.360
I hope you're right.

09:41.400 --> 09:44.130
Okay, Zira.
Let's talk.

09:44.170 --> 09:45.500
Wonderful.

09:45.540 --> 09:48.300
Children, I'll be back soon.

09:51.140 --> 09:54.240
<i> Play nice, Nuka!</i>

09:57.350 --> 09:59.380
That's right, Nuka.

09:59.420 --> 10:01.180
Let's play nice!

10:01.220 --> 10:04.220
Kion.
"Son of Simba."

10:04.250 --> 10:06.377
I'm so glad to meet you.

10:06.520 --> 10:09.460
- You are?
- Oh, yes!

10:09.490 --> 10:13.230
After all, it doesn't
matter where we live.

10:13.260 --> 10:17.300

- # Will always find us #</i>

11:49.230 --> 11:55.400
♪ Lions, lions over all ♪

11:55.430 --> 12:00.230
Zira. You and I have different
ideas about how lions should act.

12:00.270 --> 12:02.270
And that's why we're here.

12:02.310 --> 12:04.140
To talk!

12:08.180 --> 12:09.280
Whoa!

12:09.310 --> 12:14.110
It may not be Pride Rock,
but we call it home.

12:14.150 --> 12:15.250
This way.

12:16.520 --> 12:18.250
<i>And here they come!</i>

12:18.290 --> 12:19.520
Heading toward the finish.

12:19.560 --> 12:22.160
Fuli wins again!

12:27.530 --> 12:30.430
Good race, Ono!
You almost got her that time!

12:34.200 --> 12:36.200
Great!
One more run, Ono!

12:36.240 --> 12:38.140
I think you're
wearing her down.

12:42.410 --> 12:45.180
Maybe some other time.

12:45.210 --> 12:47.150
Beshte!
You wanna give it a go?

12:47.180 --> 12:48.180
I don't think so.

12:48.220 --> 12:50.320
Hey, Rafiki!
You wanna race Fuli?

12:50.350 --> 12:52.420
Me? Race Fuli?

12:52.460 --> 12:55.160
The fastest
in the Pride Lands!

12:55.190 --> 12:57.460
Who would be
so foolish to do that, huh?

13:01.530 --> 13:04.160
Hey! Where is Kion?

13:04.200 --> 13:07.270
Oh, Kion!
That's right.

13:07.300 --> 13:09.420
Kion told me to tell everyone he's going

13:09.421 --> 13:11.540
to the Outlands with Jasiri.
But he'll be right back.

13:11.570 --> 13:13.240
Why was Jasiri here?

13:13.280 --> 13:15.410
And why'd she take Kion
to the Outlands?

13:15.440 --> 13:18.110
She wanted him to talk
to some lions who live there.

13:18.150 --> 13:19.450
Lions in the Outlands?

13:19.480 --> 13:22.250
Yeah, I know.
Weird, right?

13:22.290 --> 13:27.120
No. No, no!
They are not just any lions.

13:27.160 --> 13:29.260
They are the Outsiders!

13:29.290 --> 13:31.817
- The who?
- The Outsiders are

13:31.852 --> 13:35.430
a group of lions led
by a lioness named Zira.

13:35.460 --> 13:38.230
Simba banished them
from the Pride Lands

13:38.270 --> 13:40.570
before any of you
were born.

13:40.600 --> 13:43.200
Why would Simba
banish other lions?

13:43.240 --> 13:45.170
Because Zira and her family,

13:45.210 --> 13:48.380
they were loyal only to Scar.

13:48.410 --> 13:49.480
<i>Scar?</i>

13:49.510 --> 13:53.280
After Scar was gone,
Simba became King.

13:53.320 --> 13:57.250
But Zira told Simba he could
not rule the Pride Lands.

13:57.290 --> 14:01.320
Because Scar had chosen
her son Kovu to be king.

14:01.360 --> 14:03.320
But Scar was never
the real King!

14:03.360 --> 14:05.330
Correct, honey badger!

14:05.360 --> 14:08.300
And that is
what Simba told Zira.

14:08.330 --> 14:10.560
But Zira would not
listen to reason.

14:10.600 --> 14:13.370
Instead, she attacked Simba!

14:13.400 --> 14:15.370
Of course,
Simba won quickly.

14:15.400 --> 14:19.110
But after that,
he had no choice.

14:19.140 --> 14:21.760
He had to banish Zira and her family

14:21.761 --> 14:24.380
from the Pride Lands.
Forever!

14:24.410 --> 14:27.280
So the lions in the Outlands
might be Zira and her family?

14:27.320 --> 14:29.935
Most definitely. And
if they find out that

14:29.936 --> 14:32.550
Kion is Simba's son,
there could be trouble.

14:32.590 --> 14:34.460
Much trouble!

14:34.490 --> 14:37.360
- We gotta help Kion!
- Right. Let's go!

14:37.390 --> 14:39.390
Till the Pride Lands end...

14:39.430 --> 14:41.460
<i>Lion Guard defend!</i>

14:42.530 --> 14:45.270
<i>Okay, Zira.
We're alone.</i>

14:45.300 --> 14:46.500
Tell me about the Roar.

14:46.540 --> 14:51.240
Don't worry, Kion.
I'll tell you all about it.

14:51.270 --> 14:54.140
But first, you need to tell me.

14:54.180 --> 14:57.140
Whose side are you on?
Lions?

14:57.180 --> 14:58.610
Or hyenas?

14:58.650 --> 15:01.220
I'm on the side
of the Circle of Life.

15:01.250 --> 15:03.220
And the animals who respect it.

15:05.250 --> 15:08.320
You do take after
your father, don't you?

15:10.160 --> 15:14.430
You see, Kion, I was hoping
you'd choose to side with lions.

15:14.460 --> 15:18.530
With me.
But if that's your answer...

15:22.270 --> 15:24.340
Zira? What's going on?

15:24.370 --> 15:26.510
It's your choice, Kion.

15:26.540 --> 15:30.180
With me.
Or against me.

15:30.210 --> 15:32.310
But if you're against me...

15:32.350 --> 15:35.380
You'll never leave
the Outlands.

15:35.420 --> 15:37.150
Jasiri was right.

15:37.190 --> 15:39.190
She knew not to trust you.

15:39.220 --> 15:41.460
Now tell your lionesses
to back down.

15:41.490 --> 15:43.360
You know I have the Roar.

15:43.390 --> 15:45.260
And you know what it can do.

15:45.290 --> 15:48.160
I used to know
someone else with the Roar.

15:48.200 --> 15:51.616
And when he used it
against his fellow lions,

15:51.688 --> 15:54.500
he lost the Roar.
Forever!

15:54.540 --> 15:56.440
You're talking about Scar!

15:56.470 --> 16:00.110
That's right.
Scar and I were close.

16:00.140 --> 16:01.410
Very close.

16:01.440 --> 16:04.210
He taught me
all about the Roar!

16:04.250 --> 16:06.180
If it weren't
for your father,

16:06.220 --> 16:09.150
he'd still be King
of the Pride Lands.

16:09.190 --> 16:11.220
Scar was never
the true King!

16:11.250 --> 16:13.490
How dare you!

16:13.520 --> 16:16.390
Lionesses! Attack!

16:19.500 --> 16:25.170
Wait. I'll forgive you for
that little outburst, Kion.

16:25.200 --> 16:27.200
If you join me.

16:27.240 --> 16:30.500
Think about it
while I fetch my children.

16:30.540 --> 16:33.310
I want them
to hear your decision.

16:42.590 --> 16:45.150
<i>What's taking
Mom so long?</i>

16:45.190 --> 16:47.590
I don't know.
But I'm tired of waiting!

16:48.620 --> 16:51.360
Nuka, don't start anything!

16:51.390 --> 16:52.590
Mom said to play nice!

16:52.630 --> 16:55.600
Don't worry, green eyes.

16:55.630 --> 16:59.200
Any game your brother wants
to play, I can play better!

16:59.240 --> 17:02.470
Oh, I'm not planning
to play at all!

17:02.510 --> 17:05.140
<i> Nuka!</i>

17:05.510 --> 17:07.170
Mom! You're back!

17:07.210 --> 17:10.380
Mother!
Nothing's happening here.

17:10.410 --> 17:13.210
We're just playing nice!

17:14.450 --> 17:15.450
Where's Kion?

17:15.480 --> 17:18.490
Kion and I have reached
an agreement.

17:18.520 --> 17:20.190
And what's that?

17:20.220 --> 17:24.290
We agreed that the watering
hole belongs to lions.

17:24.329 --> 17:26.359
- Only.
- What?

17:26.400 --> 17:28.530
Kion would never agree to that!

17:28.560 --> 17:33.530
He's a lion, my dear.
And we lions stick together.

17:33.570 --> 17:37.470
Now, leave!
And do not return!

17:37.510 --> 17:39.470
Fine. I'll go.

17:42.510 --> 17:45.550
Keeping me here
doesn't make any sense.

17:45.580 --> 17:49.120
I just want you lions
to share the watering hole!

17:49.150 --> 17:52.220
You can tell that to Zira
when she gets back.

17:52.250 --> 17:54.450
I don't think I want to
wait around that long.

18:06.400 --> 18:07.400
Whoa!

18:08.270 --> 18:11.240
Nice try. Now, why don't we just

18:11.241 --> 18:14.210
wait quietly for Zira to come back?

18:16.110 --> 18:19.350
Lion Guard!
What are you doing here?

18:19.380 --> 18:21.280
I know Kion said he'd be fine.

18:21.320 --> 18:23.350
But we think
he might be in trouble.

18:23.390 --> 18:25.390
- Do you know where he is?
- Yes.

18:25.420 --> 18:27.550
He's joined Zira and her family.

18:27.590 --> 18:29.160
<i>Zira?</i>

18:29.190 --> 18:31.330
<i> Hapana!
Rafiki was right!</i>

18:31.360 --> 18:34.160
- You know Zira?
- We've heard about her.

18:34.200 --> 18:37.300
And Kion wouldn't want to be
any part of her family.

18:37.330 --> 18:38.570
Ugh! I knew it.

18:38.600 --> 18:41.100
I should have
never believed her!

18:43.240 --> 18:45.170
<i> Poor Kion.</i>

18:45.210 --> 18:47.570
So helpless without his Roar.

18:47.610 --> 18:49.410
Mom? What's going on?

18:49.450 --> 18:51.210
Kion said he'd talk to Simba

18:51.250 --> 18:53.150
about letting us go back
to the Pride Lands!

18:53.180 --> 18:54.450
Why can't we be friends?

18:54.480 --> 18:56.550
This wasn't my choice, Kovu.

18:56.590 --> 19:00.090
He's the one who chose
the hyenas over us.

19:00.120 --> 19:03.320
Aren't we worried
he'll use that Roar on us?

19:03.360 --> 19:08.100
If he uses the Roar against other
lions, he'll lose it forever.

19:08.130 --> 19:10.100
And if he doesn't
use the Roar...

19:10.130 --> 19:12.470
Well, he'll just lose.

19:12.500 --> 19:14.400
Either way, we win.

19:14.440 --> 19:17.300
Without the Roar,
Kion is harmless.

19:17.340 --> 19:21.440
Without Kion, Simba's
Pride Lands are defenseless.

19:21.480 --> 19:23.410
Kion's harmless?

19:23.450 --> 19:27.180
You won't
pin me down this time!

19:30.190 --> 19:32.320
Nuka, Nuka, Nuka.

19:32.350 --> 19:35.390
This is your
last chance, Kion.

19:42.300 --> 19:45.500
Zira? I do have
something to say.

19:45.530 --> 19:47.400
Till the Pride Lands end...

19:47.440 --> 19:50.140
<i>Lion Guard defend!</i>

19:50.170 --> 19:52.570
<i>Surprise!</i>

20:03.450 --> 20:05.190
<i> Twende Kiboko!</i>

20:06.490 --> 20:08.190
Mother! I'm scared!

20:10.460 --> 20:12.130
So...

20:12.160 --> 20:15.200
A Lion Guard
with just one lion.

20:15.230 --> 20:16.600
Pathetic!

20:16.630 --> 20:19.300
Stand tall, my lions!

20:19.340 --> 20:23.270
We have this ridiculous
group of animals outnumbered!

20:23.310 --> 20:25.240
Doesn't matter, Zira!

20:25.270 --> 20:28.140
Go ahead, Kion.
Use the Roar!

20:28.180 --> 20:29.540
I... I can't.

20:31.280 --> 20:33.210
That's how Scar
lost the Roar.

20:33.250 --> 20:35.150
He used it against lions.

20:36.250 --> 20:37.450
That's not why he lost it!

20:37.490 --> 20:39.490
It was 'cause
he used it for evil!

20:39.520 --> 20:41.520
Remember Rafiki's paintings?

20:41.560 --> 20:44.220
Of course.
You're right!

20:45.360 --> 20:48.200
No! That's not true.

20:48.230 --> 20:50.230
I know the Roar's powers.

20:50.270 --> 20:51.600
Listen to me, Kion...

20:51.630 --> 20:54.300
Oh, I've listened
to you, Zira.

20:54.340 --> 20:55.600
Now, you listen to me.

20:55.640 --> 20:57.470
As long as I'm around,

20:57.510 --> 21:00.210
you're not welcome
in the Pride Lands.

21:00.240 --> 21:01.580
Or the Outlands!

21:01.610 --> 21:04.280
You... You wouldn't!

21:04.310 --> 21:05.410
We're lions!

21:14.490 --> 21:16.190
Mom! Mom!

21:16.230 --> 21:17.390
Wait for me!

21:21.260 --> 21:23.430
Huh. Where are we?

21:24.330 --> 21:26.370
Our new home.

21:27.340 --> 21:29.340
I know Jasiri believed in you.

21:29.370 --> 21:33.240
- But I'll admit, I had my doubts.
- And now?

21:33.280 --> 21:37.310
- I'm glad she has you for a friend.
- Thanks. Me, too.

21:37.350 --> 21:39.550
I'm glad to have
all of you as friends.

21:39.580 --> 21:41.520
Back at ya, Jasiri.

21:44.320 --> 21:47.490
Hey, little ones!
I'm not so scary now, huh?

21:53.260 --> 21:55.560
- Oh, well...
- Take it as a compliment.

21:55.600 --> 21:57.430
You are pretty fierce.
