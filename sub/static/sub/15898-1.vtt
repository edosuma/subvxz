00:04.917 --> 00:06.875
What is wrong with this city?

00:07.250 --> 00:10.167
There is ashes and smoke everywhere.

00:10.875 --> 00:12.708
Why doesn't someone stand against it?

00:13.208 --> 00:15.875
Why do they tolerate it?

00:16.167 --> 00:18.375
This is the limit.

00:18.792 --> 00:22.083
Let's bring this reckless act
to an end.

00:22.125 --> 00:24.417
Smoking in public places is forbidden.

00:24.708 --> 00:26.917
Not abiding by the same
can be punishable.

00:27.208 --> 00:30.292
Do not smoke.
Do not support smoking.

00:31.375 --> 00:33.500
Smoking is injurious to health.

00:37.833 --> 00:39.667
Everyone wants happiness.

00:42.083 --> 00:44.625
But at what cost?

00:45.333 --> 00:48.167
Smoking can be dangerous.

00:50.000 --> 00:53.250
Smoking is injurious to your health..

00:55.667 --> 00:57.917
...and also to your loved ones.

01:01.917 --> 01:04.125
Smoking kills.

03:07.875 --> 03:09.958
'This story dates back to 1959..'

03:10.417 --> 03:12.625
'..when Mumbai
used to be Bombay.'

03:12.667 --> 03:14.417
'Gujarat and Maharashtra.'

03:14.625 --> 03:17.542
'..were a part of
the Bombay Presidency.'

03:18.208 --> 03:20.500
'It was 12 years since
the British left..'

03:20.542 --> 03:23.250
'..but their influence
could still be clearly seen.'

03:24.208 --> 03:26.292
'Alcohol was banned in theory..'

03:26.375 --> 03:29.875
'..but there was no dearth
of hosts or their hospitality.'

03:32.083 --> 03:35.875
'The jury would decide
the verdicts on legal cases..'

03:36.333 --> 03:39.958
'..and Raj Kapoor's film
'Anari' was a runaway success.'

03:41.208 --> 03:44.000
'During those days,
the Indian Navy's influence..'

03:44.375 --> 03:47.292
'..was rapidly growing
in the Indian Ocean.'

04:11.125 --> 04:13.792
Sir, signal from
fleet headquarters.

04:18.291 --> 04:19.750
Show it to the captain.
- Yes sir.

04:30.875 --> 04:33.792
Sir. Signal from
fleet headquarters.

04:36.042 --> 04:38.708
Chief, X0 Bridge.
- Yes, sir.

04:41.625 --> 04:43.708
X0 requested bridge, captain.

05:01.292 --> 05:04.125
Sir.
- Ahh, Rustom. Take charge.

05:22.833 --> 05:25.083
Navigating officer.
- Sir.

05:27.625 --> 05:29.292
Maintain this route to Bombay.
- Sir.

05:31.875 --> 05:34.750
Chief, machine guns to stand down,
- Aye, aye, sir.

05:35.417 --> 05:36.667
Do you hear that?

05:37.083 --> 05:38.583
Do you hear that?

05:39.375 --> 05:41.042
This is the X0 speaking.

05:41.208 --> 05:43.500
The halt at Baticoloa
has been cancelled.

05:43.708 --> 05:45.875
And we're sailing
directly to Bombay.

05:46.042 --> 05:51.083
Our estimated date of arrival will
now be 26th April, 15:00 hours.

05:51.125 --> 05:52.792
Instead of 5th of May.

05:55.333 --> 05:56.292
Congratulation.

06:36.625 --> 06:39.667
Madam.
Vikram sir's car has arrived.

07:11.458 --> 07:14.542
"It is the grace of God."

07:17.792 --> 07:20.917
"it brought you and me together."

07:24.042 --> 07:33.417
"The will to die for you,
taught me to live."

07:36.125 --> 07:42.292
"With you, my love,
the world is colourful and vivid."

07:42.500 --> 07:48.583
"You are the exciting night,
I am the burning star."

07:48.792 --> 07:54.875
"With you, my love,
the world is colourful and vivid."

07:55.083 --> 08:01.250
"I will be yours,
if you just say the word."

08:20.958 --> 08:27.208
"Whichever path I take,
your fragrance follows."

08:27.292 --> 08:32.917
"You're the dream
I see every night."

08:33.582 --> 08:36.667
"Our meeting is destined."

08:36.750 --> 08:39.875
"Your presence breathes
new life into me."

08:39.917 --> 08:45.500
"I'm the barren sky, you're
the moonlight that illumines it."

08:46.250 --> 08:48.958
"it is the grace of God.."

08:49.417 --> 08:52.083
"..that your love is mine."

08:52.542 --> 08:58.167
"The will to die for you,
taught me to live."

08:58.250 --> 09:04.500
"With you, my love,
the world is colourful and vivid."

09:04.583 --> 09:10.625
"You are the exciting night,
I am the burning star."

09:17.208 --> 09:18.083
Fire.

09:30.458 --> 09:36.667
"I have come to you,
giving up all else."

09:36.750 --> 09:41.750
"My eyes speak your name, hear it."

09:43.042 --> 09:46.167
"Everything for me,
comes after you."

09:46.250 --> 09:49.333
It's a million-dollar truth."

09:49.417 --> 09:55.042
"I'll never leave you, know that."

09:55.583 --> 09:58.458
"it is the grace of God."

09:58.792 --> 10:01.625
"..that you are mine."

10:02.000 --> 10:07.500
"The will to die for you,
taught me to live."

10:07.667 --> 10:13.750
"With you, my love,
the world is colourful and vivid."

10:14.042 --> 10:20.042
"You are the exciting night,
I am the burning star."

11:19.042 --> 11:20.250
Hello aunty, how are you?

11:50.417 --> 11:51.333
Keep quiet.

12:03.708 --> 12:04.875
Cynthia.

12:07.292 --> 12:08.667
Cynthia.

12:10.000 --> 12:11.125
Where are you?

12:18.333 --> 12:20.833
Madam's gone out, sir.
- When?

12:21.167 --> 12:22.083
Yesterday..

12:22.625 --> 12:23.875
Yesterday afternoon.

12:28.708 --> 12:29.792
Thank you.

12:39.542 --> 12:40.292
Hello.

12:40.458 --> 12:42.125
Preeti..it's Rustom.

12:42.208 --> 12:44.250
Oh hi, Rusi. When did you return?

12:44.417 --> 12:45.375
Just now.

12:46.083 --> 12:47.458
Can I talk to Cynthia, please?

12:48.083 --> 12:49.417
Cynthia isn't here.

12:49.625 --> 12:51.708
In fact,
I haven't seen her for days now.

12:54.833 --> 12:56.667
Okay, okay..
- But..

14:01.083 --> 14:05.042
"My dear Cynthia, women like you
are one in a million.

14:06.917 --> 14:09.792
"I am really am a big admirer
of your beauty."

14:10.750 --> 14:15.042
"The memories of that night which
I spent with you doesn't let me sleep."

14:15.958 --> 14:18.958
"Yours.. and only yours.."

14:51.000 --> 14:51.833
Hello.

14:52.000 --> 14:55.042
Banabhai, Commander
Rustom Pavri speaking.

14:55.625 --> 14:56.792
I want to speak to Vikram.

14:56.958 --> 15:02.000
But Commander sir,
he's not at home.

16:05.125 --> 16:06.333
I'll miss you.

16:25.667 --> 16:26.958
Let it be, Jamnabai.

17:11.541 --> 17:17.291
"Your hands in mine..
together we go on a journey.."

17:18.500 --> 17:20.666
"..with our eyes locked.."

17:21.041 --> 17:23.333
"..saying it all without
uttering a word."

17:25.666 --> 17:30.250
"The fragrance of your tresses
still dwells in my breath."

17:30.583 --> 17:35.042
"it stirs my soul,
when I hold you in my arms."

17:40.292 --> 17:44.875
"How can I forget..
..what your eyes spoke?"

17:45.458 --> 17:49.792
"How can I forget the
night that we spent together?"

17:50.625 --> 17:54.500
"Yours.. and only yours.. Vikram."

17:54.583 --> 17:57.750
Russi, please. I can explain.

18:01.833 --> 18:03.250
Trust me, darling.

18:05.333 --> 18:06.417
You cannot!

19:14.042 --> 19:15.750
Don't go soft on me, Lt. Bisht.

19:16.083 --> 19:17.167
Go get me the register.

19:17.417 --> 19:18.167
Sir.

19:48.333 --> 19:50.625
Good morning, sir.
- Good morning, Rosy.

19:51.208 --> 19:54.333
Is Vikram in?
- Mr. Vikram hasn't arrived yet.

19:54.667 --> 19:57.542
Please take a seat.
I'll order tea or coffee for you.

19:58.000 --> 19:59.083
No thank you.

20:00.750 --> 20:02.292
You're looking gorgeous today.

20:03.750 --> 20:05.000
Thanks.
- Bye.

20:12.958 --> 20:15.792
How are you, Banabhai?
- I am fine.

21:10.500 --> 21:11.625
Vikram.

21:12.583 --> 21:13.708
Vikram.

21:24.792 --> 21:26.042
Sir.
- Did they talk?

21:26.125 --> 21:27.083
No, sir.

21:28.917 --> 21:29.875
Sir!

21:41.458 --> 21:44.333
Tell me honestly where were
you all last night during duty hours?

21:44.708 --> 21:45.708
Honestly, sir.

21:45.917 --> 21:48.042
Last night we left with
the jeep for patrolling..

21:48.125 --> 21:49.458
...and got a flat tyre.

21:49.625 --> 21:53.167
It took us a while
to find a garage and fix it.

21:54.042 --> 21:55.750
It can't be a coincidence..

21:56.542 --> 21:59.083
...that you took the jeep
with the broken-down wireless.

21:59.583 --> 22:01.375
And then it also had a flat tyre.

22:02.667 --> 22:05.417
And now you guys are returning
after your duty hours are over.

22:05.750 --> 22:07.583
Sir, we won't lie to you.

22:12.875 --> 22:16.208
Well.. I believe what you say.

22:17.417 --> 22:21.083
All of you write a report.

22:22.458 --> 22:24.708
Doesn't have to be a long one.

22:25.833 --> 22:29.917
Just write which
tyre was punctured.

22:31.208 --> 22:33.208
Without consulting each other.

22:37.958 --> 22:39.375
Forgive us, sir.

22:39.667 --> 22:41.208
There wasn't much work yesterday..

22:41.458 --> 22:44.167
...so we were
strolling on the beach.

22:45.500 --> 22:47.042
<i>Pat“.
- 8'“.</i>

22:47.375 --> 22:49.458
Deduct seven days salary.
- But sir..

22:49.542 --> 22:50.625
Out!

22:57.583 --> 23:00.042
Another failed attempt to fool..

23:00.292 --> 23:02.500
...Bombay CID's
most talented officer.

23:04.625 --> 23:06.167
This is my last signature.

23:06.250 --> 23:07.792
I am on a holiday from tomorrow.

23:08.000 --> 23:09.333
15 days of rest and relaxation.
- Okay.

23:14.875 --> 23:17.042
I am Commander Rustom Pavri,
Indian Navy.

23:17.250 --> 23:19.333
Vikram Makhija died by my hands.

23:19.583 --> 23:21.083
And I want to surrender.

23:28.583 --> 23:30.125
Can I have a glass of water please?

23:47.042 --> 23:48.000
What?

24:25.375 --> 24:26.875
Madam..please wait..
- Get Lost

24:42.042 --> 24:43.625
Who the hell is in-charge here?

24:57.750 --> 25:00.417
Vincent Lobo,
investigating officer.

25:00.875 --> 25:02.667
Rustom Pavri killed my brother!

25:02.750 --> 25:04.542
Arrest him right now!

25:05.167 --> 25:08.917
Commander Pavri surrendered
himself half an hour ago.

25:09.250 --> 25:10.542
Then what are you doing here?

25:10.625 --> 25:12.333
Go there, interrogate him.

25:14.667 --> 25:17.875
Madam, I don't need you
to tell me what I need to do.

25:18.250 --> 25:20.667
Do you have any idea
who you're talking to?

25:20.750 --> 25:22.208
Or who's the guy who died?

25:23.167 --> 25:25.667
I've really high connections.

25:26.250 --> 25:29.125
It's best you just do as I say.
- No, madam.

25:29.833 --> 25:31.375
You will do as I say.

25:33.458 --> 25:37.500
This is a crime scene,
and you're contaminating the evidence.

25:38.208 --> 25:42.333
So please get out right now.

25:45.000 --> 25:46.125
Please leave, madam.

25:58.833 --> 26:00.917
They don't even let me pee in peace.

26:04.458 --> 26:05.292
Yes.

26:05.458 --> 26:07.708
Erich sir, it's me Tukaram.

26:07.958 --> 26:09.708
Yes, Tukia, what's the news?

26:10.000 --> 26:11.792
Sir, Vikram Makhija,
the owner of Imperial Motors..

26:12.208 --> 26:13.708
...has been murdered.

26:14.000 --> 26:15.333
What are you saying?

26:16.042 --> 26:16.917
Who killed him?

26:17.000 --> 26:18.667
That news is worth 5O rupees.

26:19.375 --> 26:21.875
His killer is some high-ranking
officer from the Navy.

26:23.208 --> 26:24.333
What's his name?

26:24.958 --> 26:26.542
Commander Rustom Pavri.

26:26.750 --> 26:27.875
<i>P av fl'?</i>

26:29.875 --> 26:32.958
Tukia, I'll pay you 100.

26:33.458 --> 26:36.708
But don't give this piece
of news to any other newspaper.

26:36.792 --> 26:38.125
Don't worry, sir.

26:46.833 --> 26:49.000
Lord, you're so merciful.

26:50.208 --> 26:52.333
My days will soon come back.

26:53.083 --> 26:56.333
"Fire in the Dockyard, 300 perish."

26:56.542 --> 26:58.375
12,000 copies sold.

26:58.958 --> 27:00.750
"Rains Gold."

27:00.833 --> 27:02.833
17,000 copies sold.

27:04.917 --> 27:08.542
"Train Derails. 400 die."

27:10.625 --> 27:12.792
13,500 copies sold.

27:14.750 --> 27:16.083
Where were you?

27:16.167 --> 27:18.042
Stop the press right now?

27:18.292 --> 27:20.625
But sir, the press is already
rolling. We'll be facing losses.

27:20.708 --> 27:23.083
You fool, don't worry about that.

27:23.333 --> 27:24.667
I've a piece of news..

27:24.750 --> 27:27.583
...which will clear
all your salary dues.

27:27.958 --> 27:29.875
Go, and stop the press immediately.
- Yes.

27:44.708 --> 27:45.875
Commander sir.

27:47.833 --> 27:50.625
Your wife is
still waiting outside.

27:51.292 --> 27:53.625
Would you..
- Please ask her to leave.

27:54.958 --> 27:56.792
I don't want to meet anyone.

28:12.167 --> 28:13.250
I am sorry.

28:30.750 --> 28:32.500
This was bound to happen someday.

28:32.792 --> 28:33.917
What do you mean?

28:34.083 --> 28:37.250
Sir, I am sure you know
about Vikram Makhija's character.

28:37.917 --> 28:40.458
He thought he was cupid.

28:41.167 --> 28:42.667
But there's one thing
I don't understand.

28:43.708 --> 28:45.333
How could the Commander's wife..

28:45.417 --> 28:46.917
...fall for a man like him?

29:01.667 --> 29:04.917
25 paise! 25 paise! 25 paise!

29:05.167 --> 29:08.083
Commander steps out of the house,
and lover steps in.

29:08.167 --> 29:10.792
Find out whom did the
brave Commander shoot.

29:10.875 --> 29:12.708
25 paise!
Here's your change, madam.

29:12.792 --> 29:13.875
Here you go, sir.

29:13.958 --> 29:16.458
And go home quickly,
your wife's all alone at home.

29:16.542 --> 29:18.125
Go sir, go now.

29:22.917 --> 29:25.625
Lakshman, I want him hanged.

29:26.250 --> 29:27.708
Don't worry.

29:28.125 --> 29:32.417
Vikram was an important
member of our Sindhi community.

29:33.708 --> 29:35.917
I guarantee you Rustom's conviction.

29:36.875 --> 29:38.292
And what about him?

29:40.875 --> 29:43.292
It's just a tabloid,
just ignore it.

29:45.042 --> 29:49.625
No one takes this piece of
crap or its bankrupt owner seriously.

29:49.708 --> 29:50.667
He is a nobody.

30:03.542 --> 30:06.042
I've an appointment with JJ sir.
- Sure.

30:11.250 --> 30:13.917
Yes, Erich, what do you want?

30:14.875 --> 30:17.917
You must have heard
about Rustom Pavri.

30:20.542 --> 30:22.500
Makhija had it coming.

30:22.917 --> 30:25.208
Just sad to hear about Rustom.

30:25.708 --> 30:27.625
I've met him a couple of times.

30:28.375 --> 30:29.583
Nice boy.

30:30.708 --> 30:35.500
JJ sir, Lakshman Khangani's
been handed this case.

30:35.542 --> 30:36.458
$0?

30:36.500 --> 30:42.375
Can't be a coincidence that
Vikram and Khangani are Sindhis.

30:42.792 --> 30:45.167
Preeti Makhija
is using her influence.

30:45.250 --> 30:47.167
Come to the point, Erich.

30:50.625 --> 30:54.958
We must help our fellow Parsi.

30:55.042 --> 30:57.833
Don't give me this 'caring
for fellow Parsis' crap.

30:59.125 --> 31:04.250
Forget individuals, you didn't even spare
our religion to sell your newspaper.

31:04.750 --> 31:07.792
Tell me clearly, what do you want?

31:08.375 --> 31:10.833
Sir, I want us..

31:11.125 --> 31:16.292
I mean you, to appoint
a good lawyer for Rustom.

31:16.708 --> 31:17.833
Why?

31:18.625 --> 31:22.917
JJ sir, Khangani is a cunning man.

31:24.000 --> 31:28.417
And Rustom should get one
fair chance to defend himself.

31:30.208 --> 31:32.042
You can abuse me if you like..

31:32.833 --> 31:37.958
...but even you know, Rustom
did the right thing, in the wrong way.

31:40.000 --> 31:41.625
And now he's alone.

31:42.333 --> 31:45.417
And there will be an
entire community against him.

31:50.333 --> 31:51.500
How did you get here?

31:52.958 --> 31:53.917
Taxi?

31:55.625 --> 31:57.167
Did you pay the fare?

32:01.000 --> 32:02.792
Okay, let's begin.

32:03.375 --> 32:05.333
Thank you very much, JJ sir.

32:06.375 --> 32:07.917
Erich.
- Yes, sir?

32:08.583 --> 32:11.708
Every morning I read
all the newspapers.

32:13.083 --> 32:16.750
The sympathy for Rustom
amongst people shouldn't fade away.

32:17.708 --> 32:20.458
The jury gives
their verdict in the end.

32:20.542 --> 32:22.792
It's the people who decide first.

32:23.833 --> 32:25.167
Yes, sir.

32:32.958 --> 32:35.125
50 paise! 50 paise!

32:35.208 --> 32:37.875
Vikram Makhija practiced voodoo.

32:37.958 --> 32:41.042
He would cast spells
and charm the women.

32:41.125 --> 32:43.333
Commander's supposed
to be presented in the court.

32:43.417 --> 32:46.542
Read all about it in our
special edition for only 50 paise!

34:01.542 --> 34:05.250
I've an application,
from the Indian Navy.

34:06.167 --> 34:08.250
Applicant introduce yourself.

34:08.625 --> 34:11.333
My lord, I am
Lt. Commander Pujari.

34:11.417 --> 34:12.792
From the Naval Law Cadre.

34:12.875 --> 34:14.875
On behalf of the Indian Navy..

34:14.917 --> 34:17.000
...we've requested
Commander Rustom Pavri..

34:17.083 --> 34:18.625
...to be placed
under Naval custody.

34:18.958 --> 34:20.250
On what grounds?

34:20.333 --> 34:23.708
My lord, Commander Pavri is a
highly decorated officer of the Navy.

34:23.792 --> 34:25.917
It won't be right to
keep him with petty criminals.

34:26.250 --> 34:27.625
He's a criminal.

34:28.458 --> 34:30.500
He killed my brother!

34:30.667 --> 34:33.000
He should remain
in police custody.

34:33.542 --> 34:35.000
Who are you?

34:35.500 --> 34:38.667
I am Vikram Makhija's sister,
Preeti Makhija.

34:39.875 --> 34:42.583
I am sorry for your loss, Ms. Makhija.

34:43.875 --> 34:47.875
But if you interrupt
my court proceedings again..

34:48.750 --> 34:51.000
...then I will hold you in contempt.

34:53.042 --> 34:54.375
Sit down.

34:55.583 --> 34:56.500
Preeti.

35:04.208 --> 35:05.208
Proceed.

35:05.458 --> 35:09.458
Sir, whenever his presence
is required, we will bring him here.

35:09.542 --> 35:12.000
The Navy is willing
to give this undertaking.

35:12.667 --> 35:15.125
Any objections from
the investigating officer?

35:15.167 --> 35:16.208
None, my lord.

35:16.292 --> 35:17.958
Excuse me, my lord.

35:18.333 --> 35:20.292
I want to remain
in police custody.

35:20.500 --> 35:23.625
I don't want any special treatment
because of my rank or achievements.

35:24.417 --> 35:25.625
Excuse me, my lord.

35:25.917 --> 35:27.542
I am Captain C.P. Cherian.

35:27.833 --> 35:29.292
My lord, with your permission..

35:29.375 --> 35:31.917
...can I speak with Commander
Pavri for a minute?

35:36.708 --> 35:40.333
Rustom, the Navy supports you.

35:41.042 --> 35:43.000
You'll be kept in the officer's mess.

35:43.583 --> 35:45.958
And you will have all the amenities.

35:47.875 --> 35:50.208
Sir, I would like to
remain in police custody.

35:52.875 --> 35:54.583
These are direct orders.

35:54.750 --> 35:56.292
I refuse.

35:58.125 --> 36:00.250
Do you know the consequences
of your attitude?

36:04.375 --> 36:06.750
My lord, I would like
to request the court..

36:06.833 --> 36:08.708
...to keep me in police custody.

36:08.958 --> 36:09.833
Please.

36:13.917 --> 36:14.958
Thank you, your honor.

36:19.958 --> 36:21.792
What's the status of
the charge-sheet, officer?

36:22.750 --> 36:24.708
Sir, I am still investigating.

36:25.083 --> 36:27.333
Please file the charge-sheet
as soon as possible.

36:27.500 --> 36:28.750
Yes, sir.

36:29.208 --> 36:33.542
The court grants Commander Pavri..
7 days of police custody.

36:42.958 --> 36:46.250
What was the relation between
the Commander and Vikram?

36:48.333 --> 36:49.667
They were friends.

36:50.000 --> 36:53.250
In fact Rustom,
Vikram, Cynthia and me..

36:53.625 --> 36:55.333
We belonged to the same circle.

36:57.792 --> 36:58.917
<i>'F fiends .'</i>

37:01.917 --> 37:09.542
When did Mrs. Pavri and
Vikram Makhija become close?

37:12.542 --> 37:14.333
They would all meet quite frequently.

37:14.542 --> 37:16.958
Sir, madam, Vikram, Preeti.

37:18.000 --> 37:21.917
After sir left for London,
then these three would meet.

37:22.292 --> 37:25.750
That's when I felt something's fishy.

37:36.292 --> 37:37.542
Where would they meet?

37:44.417 --> 37:45.375
Everywhere.

37:46.792 --> 37:49.583
Publicly...privately.

37:51.250 --> 37:53.292
Madam would also come home.

37:55.833 --> 37:59.958
Didn't you feel..this was wrong?

38:01.917 --> 38:03.417
There was nothing wrong in it.

38:04.292 --> 38:06.250
Cynthia wasn't a kid.

38:06.917 --> 38:08.667
She liked my brother.

38:09.833 --> 38:13.458
Haven't you heard the
term 'consenting adults'?

38:15.167 --> 38:16.292
Then?

38:19.708 --> 38:21.500
He read the letters..

38:21.583 --> 38:24.333
...and in a fit of rage
he broke his photo frame.

38:26.417 --> 38:27.833
What time did this happen?

38:29.458 --> 38:31.458
At around 8:45am.

38:33.250 --> 38:35.208
Then? What happened next?

38:36.083 --> 38:39.083
The Commander simply
said "it's alright" and left.

38:43.458 --> 38:45.583
'London!

38:51.125 --> 38:52.250
Mrs. Pavri.

38:56.458 --> 38:59.625
Why did Commander Pavri go to London?

39:02.208 --> 39:04.667
He was sent there on official duty.

39:05.750 --> 39:10.542
Mrs. Pavri, how much did
you actually like Vikram Makhija?

39:14.875 --> 39:17.958
Can I leave please? I am very tired.

39:26.708 --> 39:30.208
Sir, there's no reason
to hold the Commander.

39:30.542 --> 39:32.250
We should in fact give
him another medal and let him go.

39:46.750 --> 39:49.417
All well, Commander sir? Any problems?

39:50.500 --> 39:51.708
Not at all.

39:52.375 --> 39:54.042
And thank you for all this.

39:55.958 --> 39:58.542
If you don't mind, I would
like to ask you few questions..

39:58.625 --> 40:00.333
...about your personal life.

40:00.625 --> 40:03.417
If you don't want to answer them..
- Please ask.

40:08.167 --> 40:10.417
When did you first
meet Vikram Makhija?

40:13.167 --> 40:14.750
<i>Around 1 'A years ago.</i>

40:15.417 --> 40:17.833
On Rear Admiral Prashant
Kamath's birthday party.

40:27.958 --> 40:32.667
"I saw you a thousand times.."

40:33.000 --> 40:37.625
"..then why the restlessness."

40:37.708 --> 40:42.917
"My heart goes crazy when I see you.."

40:43.000 --> 40:47.583
"..there's surely
something about you."

40:47.750 --> 40:57.917
"Every breath I draw
seeks your permission."

40:58.000 --> 41:02.875
"I fail to find myself.."

41:02.958 --> 41:07.917
"..all that is left is you."

41:17.333 --> 41:20.000
Permission to steal your
beautiful wife, for a while?

41:20.083 --> 41:23.083
I want to show-off a bit.
- By all means, sir.

41:28.000 --> 41:32.792
"Intolerant to a moment
of separation from you.."

41:32.875 --> 41:37.792
"..this feeling is something else."

41:42.792 --> 41:47.708
"We are close despite being far.."

41:47.958 --> 41:52.500
"..this bond is something else."

41:52.750 --> 41:57.917
"I have seen you a thousand times.."

41:58.000 --> 42:02.625
"..yet the eagerness persists."

42:02.708 --> 42:07.833
"Uncontrollable is the heart.."

42:07.917 --> 42:12.750
"..such is the way of love."

42:33.875 --> 42:36.625
Do all Navy Admirals
flirt like this, or..

42:37.875 --> 42:39.917
No, this one's a bit decent.

42:43.333 --> 42:46.125
Commander Rustom Pavri.
- Vikram Makhija.

42:46.208 --> 42:47.417
Pleasure meeting you.

42:54.500 --> 42:56.500
So how's the Navy's
Aviation program doing?

42:58.042 --> 42:59.250
Excuse me?

43:00.500 --> 43:03.833
The Navy's buying new ships,
that's no more a secret.

43:05.542 --> 43:06.833
It's doing well.

43:08.375 --> 43:10.208
You know if we have
6 Kilo class submarines..

43:10.292 --> 43:14.208
...15 Petre class missile
boats and 5 R class destroyers.

43:15.042 --> 43:17.083
...we'll be unbeatable in this region,
let me tell you that.

43:18.333 --> 43:22.458
Aah, Vikram. I see you've
already met Rustom. - Just now.

43:22.833 --> 43:24.208
This is Mrs. Cynthia Pavri.

43:24.292 --> 43:26.750
Cynthia, this is Vikram Makhija,
our host for the evening.

43:26.958 --> 43:29.833
And this bungalow belongs to him.
- Hello.

43:29.917 --> 43:33.083
Pleasure to meet you.
- Not his alone, it's mine too.

43:36.833 --> 43:37.667
Hi.

43:38.917 --> 43:40.125
Preeti Makhija.

43:41.333 --> 43:44.125
My wife, Cynthia.
- Hi.

43:44.708 --> 43:45.583
Hi.

43:46.000 --> 43:49.667
"Her presence illuminated the night."

43:49.875 --> 43:54.083
"The moon itself bowed at her feet."

43:54.708 --> 43:57.417
Well, he gets a bit poetic..

43:57.500 --> 43:58.792
...in the presence of beautiful women.

43:58.875 --> 43:59.750
Excuse him.

44:01.792 --> 44:02.792
Vikram.
- Yes?

44:02.875 --> 44:05.000
Mr. Anderson is waiting for us.
- Oh yes.

44:05.917 --> 44:07.750
Excuse us.

44:12.833 --> 44:14.083
Mr. Anderson.

44:15.125 --> 44:16.375
Hello, hello, hello.

44:16.458 --> 44:17.542
Sir, who is he?

44:18.833 --> 44:20.500
Just a loaded civilian, Rustom.

44:20.750 --> 44:21.833
And a dear friend.

44:22.542 --> 44:25.208
He's the Indian representative for
many British and American companies.

44:26.208 --> 44:28.917
Decent chap. I'll vouch for him.

44:37.500 --> 44:40.042
After that we met
at many such parties.

44:40.250 --> 44:42.417
And we became very good friends.

44:43.083 --> 44:45.958
Sir. DCP sir is on the line.

44:51.625 --> 44:55.125
Commander, why did you go to London?

44:55.542 --> 44:57.542
<i>USN,
' Huh'?</i>

44:57.958 --> 44:59.583
Meaning under the
Official Secret Act..

44:59.667 --> 45:01.958
...I cannot share those
details with anyone.

45:02.375 --> 45:03.375
I am sorry.

45:05.833 --> 45:07.000
No, it's okay.

45:15.625 --> 45:19.000
Do we have any other legal recourse?
- Not advisable, sir.

45:19.250 --> 45:22.667
But sir, does it matter whether
Commander Pavri stays here or there.

45:38.833 --> 45:40.167
I need those documents, Cherian.

45:40.250 --> 45:41.208
At any cost.

45:42.167 --> 45:44.333
If anyone gets their
hands on those papers..

45:45.208 --> 45:47.083
...then we'll be in deep trouble.

45:48.042 --> 45:49.583
Send someone to his house.

45:57.042 --> 45:59.042
Sohrab Khandwala, senior advocate.

45:59.750 --> 46:01.833
I've come here to help you, my son.

46:02.458 --> 46:04.417
I've decided to defend your case.

46:06.458 --> 46:08.708
How can you make such a big mistake,
brother Sohrab?

46:09.708 --> 46:11.333
It's an open and shut case.

46:12.458 --> 46:15.292
I killed Vikram, and I admit it.

46:15.583 --> 46:16.917
Don't say this to anyone else..

46:17.000 --> 46:20.667
...otherwise even I can't save you,
let alone God.

46:24.125 --> 46:27.125
Rustom, according to my sources..

46:27.208 --> 46:31.333
...Cynthia was with Vikram
before the incident.

46:32.125 --> 46:36.500
And I will tell the people
everything through my newspaper.

46:36.792 --> 46:37.833
Don't worry.

46:38.458 --> 46:39.875
Just sign this..

46:39.958 --> 46:44.042
You'll stoop to publicly humiliating
my wife in order to save me.

46:44.333 --> 46:46.417
Thanks..but no thanks.

47:10.042 --> 47:11.167
Yes?

47:11.417 --> 47:14.917
Rustom is refusing to appoint
any lawyer to defend his case.

47:16.583 --> 47:19.792
Because he doesn't want
you to get publicly humiliated.

47:46.375 --> 47:48.375
Do you want to see Rustom walk free?

47:51.125 --> 47:57.167
It doesn't bother me..what
opinions others have about me.

48:00.417 --> 48:01.458
<i>But yes“</i>

48:03.625 --> 48:06.375
...I'm prepared to do anything
in order to see Russi walk free.

48:07.583 --> 48:10.250
We don't have to do 'anything'.

48:10.875 --> 48:13.667
Just a little bit will do.

49:55.167 --> 49:56.792
I am sorry, madam.

49:58.083 --> 50:00.042
But he doesn't want
to meet you today either.

50:01.000 --> 50:04.667
I must see him. It's very important.

50:04.750 --> 50:07.750
Madam, we've certain
rules and regulations.

50:07.833 --> 50:10.250
If he doesn't want to meet you,
then you can't.. - Tukia.

50:11.292 --> 50:13.833
Can you convey my message to him?

50:19.292 --> 50:20.625
Commander sir.

50:22.167 --> 50:23.625
Your wife sent this message.

51:08.542 --> 51:10.292
I am so sorry, Russi.

51:11.292 --> 51:13.208
I want to tell you everything.

51:15.167 --> 51:17.708
I've lost all respect
for myself so much..

51:18.458 --> 51:21.375
...that sometimes I feel only
my death is the end of all this.

51:21.458 --> 51:24.750
Sorry. I was so lonely..l was na'l've
and I was stupid you know, I was..

51:24.833 --> 51:26.250
I was so stupid.

51:34.917 --> 51:37.250
Russi, please talk to me.

51:39.833 --> 51:42.292
I can't take your silence anymore.

51:47.667 --> 51:50.417
I regret my actions.

52:54.250 --> 52:56.542
'I started spending time with Preeti.'

52:58.500 --> 53:02.958
'Spending some time with her
would make me forget my loneliness.'

53:09.208 --> 53:11.417
'Sometimes Vikram
would join us as well.'

53:27.208 --> 53:32.250
Then, on my birthday, Preeti arranged
for a party, even though I refused.

53:33.292 --> 53:34.667
In her bungalow.

53:36.750 --> 53:38.333
When I arrived there..

53:38.625 --> 53:41.542
I am so sorry, Cynthia.
I must go to Pune immediately.

53:41.625 --> 53:43.667
Actually, a friend of
mine has met with an accident.

53:43.750 --> 53:46.000
But..Vikram will take
care of you tonight.

53:46.083 --> 53:47.875
I'll see you when I am back. Bye.

53:47.958 --> 53:48.583
Bye.
- Take care.

53:48.667 --> 53:49.750
Preeti!

53:55.667 --> 53:58.708
Vikram, I am really
sorry but.. I want to leave.

53:58.792 --> 54:00.333
I don't know anyone.

54:00.417 --> 54:03.208
Don't be silly, this is your party.

54:04.333 --> 54:05.833
But I don't know anyone.

54:05.917 --> 54:06.958
Oh, come on.

54:07.000 --> 54:10.333
The most gorgeous woman on this planet
doesn't need to care about it, right?

54:12.458 --> 54:15.000
But..
- Okay, fine.

54:15.500 --> 54:17.042
Just give it 1O minutes.

54:17.792 --> 54:20.625
If you're still uncomfortable,
you can leave.

54:20.792 --> 54:21.875
May I?

54:24.250 --> 54:25.083
Please!

54:30.042 --> 54:31.125
Okay.

54:32.208 --> 54:35.292
Ladies and Gentlemen, here she is.

54:35.792 --> 54:37.583
The birthday girl, Cynthia.

54:38.250 --> 54:39.833
Let's hear for her

54:39.917 --> 54:42.583
"Happy birthday to you."

54:43.333 --> 54:46.375
"Happy birthday to you."

54:46.667 --> 54:50.042
"Happy birthday, happy birthday.."

54:50.250 --> 54:54.042
"Happy birthday, dear Cynthia."

55:24.250 --> 55:26.250
'Vikram would never
miss any opportunity.."

55:26.458 --> 55:30.375
'To flatter me.. to get close to me.'

55:30.667 --> 55:31.708
Don't.

55:33.083 --> 55:35.125
Can you close your
eyes for a moment? Please.

55:35.708 --> 55:39.625
But Vikram..
- Cynthia, trust me.

55:50.042 --> 55:51.917
Many, many happy returns of the day.

55:55.333 --> 55:57.042
Vikram, I can't accept this.

55:57.292 --> 55:59.708
Why? You didn't like it?

56:00.708 --> 56:02.708
Because it's very..
- Expensive?

56:03.667 --> 56:04.625
Yes.

56:10.958 --> 56:12.042
What did you do?

56:12.125 --> 56:13.083
How will you..

56:14.875 --> 56:16.667
You had a problem accepting it.

56:17.500 --> 56:19.583
And I had a problem with your problem.

56:19.833 --> 56:22.583
Why waste our time
over a piece of scrap?

56:23.542 --> 56:25.250
You're completely crazy.

56:25.458 --> 56:26.792
It wasn't scrap.

56:27.167 --> 56:28.292
Now go find it.

56:28.375 --> 56:29.750
Will you wear it if I do?

56:34.833 --> 56:35.917
Yes, I will.

56:48.958 --> 56:51.208
When Preeti didn't return for weeks..

56:52.792 --> 56:58.875
...then Vikram would invite
me to dinners and parties.

57:27.667 --> 57:32.833
And one day.. when Vikram
and I were alone at his Bungalow.

57:41.167 --> 57:42.750
Seems like it's going to rain.

57:47.750 --> 57:48.583
Come on.

57:49.125 --> 57:50.250
Cynthia.

57:53.250 --> 57:54.208
Wait.

57:58.833 --> 58:00.042
You okay?
- Yeah.

58:03.000 --> 58:04.000
What happened?

58:05.208 --> 58:06.750
I think it's a sprain.

58:08.042 --> 58:09.750
Let's go inside, I'll call the doctor.

58:18.417 --> 58:19.417
Vikram!

58:20.875 --> 58:22.708
Trust me, Relax.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.875
Cynthia, we didn't do anything wrong.

01:00:55.708 --> 01:01:00.292
You know, Russi..
when you were leaving me..

01:01:00.708 --> 01:01:02.458
...I was really hurt..

01:01:04.125 --> 01:01:06.292
...because you weren't listening to me.

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:11.667
Maybe I wanted to hurt you too.

01:01:14.458 --> 01:01:16.333
And in the process I made such a..

01:01:16.750 --> 01:01:18.000
What happened next?

01:01:22.750 --> 01:01:23.667
Strange.

01:01:23.958 --> 01:01:25.958
Until yesterday the Commander
didn't want to see his wife.

01:01:26.333 --> 01:01:27.792
Now it's been over an hour.

01:01:28.125 --> 01:01:29.667
I wonder what's cooking between them.

01:01:30.083 --> 01:01:31.458
What's written on the note?

01:01:32.833 --> 01:01:35.458
"Two men threatened me with
a knife and forcefully barged in .."

01:01:35.542 --> 01:01:37.375
"..and searched the entire house."

01:01:38.083 --> 01:01:39.167
How do you know?

01:01:44.792 --> 01:01:46.083
Why didn't you tell me?

01:01:48.458 --> 01:01:50.000
What is this all about?

01:02:00.292 --> 01:02:01.625
Did they take anything?

01:02:04.208 --> 01:02:05.458
Nothing.

01:02:06.583 --> 01:02:09.375
They were looking for something,
but maybe they didn't find it.

01:02:17.042 --> 01:02:18.042
Don't worry.

01:02:19.083 --> 01:02:20.542
Now listen to me carefully.

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:22.333
Damn it!

01:02:25.542 --> 01:02:26.792
Where could he have hidden it?

01:02:40.333 --> 01:02:45.208
Commander's wife said "Don't punish
an honest officer for my mistake".

01:02:45.292 --> 01:02:48.042
Read all about it in our
special edition for only 1 rupee.

01:02:48.125 --> 01:02:50.500
Know Cynthia Pavri's
story for only 1 rupee.

01:02:50.583 --> 01:02:53.125
Know Cynthia Pavri's
story for only 1 rupee..

01:02:54.458 --> 01:02:55.833
You said, he's a nobody.

01:02:56.208 --> 01:02:58.292
A has-been whose tabloid
will soon shut down.

01:02:58.917 --> 01:03:00.417
Well, his tabloid didn't shut down..

01:03:00.792 --> 01:03:02.792
...instead it's getting increasingly
difficult to buy a copy.

01:03:03.458 --> 01:03:05.208
And did you read Cynthia's statement?

01:03:06.292 --> 01:03:07.542
That bitch!

01:03:08.625 --> 01:03:12.500
Lakshman, this newspaper is
shifting the focus of the people..

01:03:12.583 --> 01:03:15.542
...from my brother's
murder to Rustom's honesty.

01:03:23.417 --> 01:03:26.250
His honesty will make
things easy for us, Preeti.

01:03:27.875 --> 01:03:32.250
Rustom will admit to committing
this murder in the court.

01:03:35.375 --> 01:03:36.917
Matter closed.

01:03:38.458 --> 01:03:39.542
Relax, Preeti.

01:03:42.042 --> 01:03:43.083
Take a seat.

01:04:12.417 --> 01:04:16.833
Commander Pavri,
you don't want to appoint a lawyer.

01:04:17.083 --> 01:04:18.417
Yes, your honor.

01:04:18.750 --> 01:04:21.125
You've been accused
under section-302..

01:04:21.833 --> 01:04:24.042
...of murdering Vikram Makhija.

01:04:25.250 --> 01:04:27.083
Do you admit to your crime?

01:04:44.250 --> 01:04:48.042
No, my lord. I plead 'Not Guilty'.

01:04:56.917 --> 01:04:58.375
Order! Order!

01:04:58.708 --> 01:05:00.875
The trial begins on 25th May.

01:05:01.542 --> 01:05:05.083
Will you defend your case personally?
- Yes, my lord.

01:05:05.417 --> 01:05:07.708
Remember this, Commander Pavri.

01:05:08.958 --> 01:05:11.375
If you're found guilty in this court..

01:05:11.917 --> 01:05:15.708
...then you can't make an appeal on the
grounds of not appointing any lawyer.

01:05:16.333 --> 01:05:19.542
My lord, I give you
a written undertaking that..

01:05:19.625 --> 01:05:21.292
...if this court finds me guilty..

01:05:21.375 --> 01:05:24.000
...then I will never make
an appeal to any higher court.

01:05:58.375 --> 01:06:02.583
Commander sir.. playing all alone?

01:06:03.583 --> 01:06:06.292
Then you will win each time.

01:06:08.625 --> 01:06:10.458
Come, you make the first move.

01:06:16.167 --> 01:06:18.500
You already made your first move.

01:06:20.625 --> 01:06:21.708
AnyWaY-

01:06:30.042 --> 01:06:35.333
Did Vikram and you
share business relations?

01:06:35.792 --> 01:06:38.208
I am a soldier, not a businessman.

01:06:38.958 --> 01:06:43.417
When Vikram gifted such
an expensive car to Mrs. Pavri..

01:06:43.500 --> 01:06:45.083
...why didn't you object?

01:06:45.500 --> 01:06:48.167
I thought about it, but I didn't
think it would be right to object.

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.583
And on the other hand, my friendship
with him didn't let me doubt him.

01:06:52.750 --> 01:06:55.167
Trust can be a very, very funny thing.

01:06:55.500 --> 01:07:01.250
Maybe Vikram grew bolder
because you didn't object.

01:07:02.375 --> 01:07:03.708
Quite possible.

01:07:05.583 --> 01:07:09.792
Commander sir,
since your marriage to Mrs. Pavri..

01:07:09.875 --> 01:07:14.917
...did you have relations
with any other woman? - No.

01:07:32.292 --> 01:07:39.208
Commander sir,
are all your parts intact?

01:07:40.625 --> 01:07:44.542
Lobo sir, if you think real
manliness lies in having an affair..

01:07:44.625 --> 01:07:46.375
...with another woman
while in a marriage..

01:07:46.417 --> 01:07:47.958
...then your suspicions are true.

01:07:48.167 --> 01:07:49.458
Check.

01:08:03.500 --> 01:08:04.583
Checkmate!

01:08:11.625 --> 01:08:12.917
I must admit, Commander.

01:08:14.958 --> 01:08:18.625
When you sacrificed your queen,
I thought you made a mistake.

01:08:20.500 --> 01:08:22.000
But now I understand..

01:08:22.875 --> 01:08:24.750
...it was a well-thought plan.

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:27.750
It's all about winning the game.

01:08:28.832 --> 01:08:31.625
Whether you sacrifice
your pawn, or the queen.

01:08:33.500 --> 01:08:39.332
"Unfamiliar is the terrain.."

01:08:39.917 --> 01:08:46.207
"Unknown are the
enemies and the friends."

01:08:46.707 --> 01:08:53.042
"Whether we die to find them or kill."

01:08:53.417 --> 01:08:59.292
"Love is love after all,
despite how we find it."

01:09:01.250 --> 01:09:06.082
"Who cares about right and wrong!"

01:09:07.832 --> 01:09:14.042
"The last man standing is the Rustom."

01:09:33.082 --> 01:09:36.167
"if there's love, there's life.."

01:09:36.250 --> 01:09:40.582
"if there's glory,
it's in Rustom's name."

01:09:41.457 --> 01:09:46.792
Cynthia, I am..
really worried about your future.

01:09:47.667 --> 01:09:48.375
Why?

01:09:49.292 --> 01:09:53.250
The navy has decided
to dismiss Rustom.

01:09:55.292 --> 01:09:58.083
And he might divorce you too.

01:09:59.333 --> 01:10:01.625
And.. poor Vikram's dead too.

01:10:02.667 --> 01:10:03.750
Sad.

01:10:04.583 --> 01:10:07.792
You know, it's very difficult
for a single woman..

01:10:07.875 --> 01:10:11.875
...to survive without any support.

01:10:13.333 --> 01:10:14.250
Please.

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:29.375
I have a way.. which will take care
of your financial problems, for life.

01:10:31.125 --> 01:10:34.333
Would you like to hear it?
- Of course.

01:10:38.583 --> 01:10:42.542
Rustom has some very extremely
important and classified documents..

01:10:42.625 --> 01:10:43.958
...which we want.

01:10:45.083 --> 01:10:48.333
But he's acting kind
of strange these days.

01:10:49.208 --> 01:10:55.125
Look Cynthia, we're willing to
give you one million rupees for this.

01:10:57.042 --> 01:11:00.792
One million?
- One million!

01:11:29.625 --> 01:11:32.875
Pardon me, Admiral Kamath.

01:11:34.250 --> 01:11:38.458
But now I am worried
about your future.

01:11:41.417 --> 01:11:43.750
Rustom had already warned me.

01:11:44.042 --> 01:11:45.917
'Listen to me carefully.'

01:11:47.250 --> 01:11:49.333
'Soon Admiral Kamath
will come to see you..'

01:11:49.417 --> 01:11:52.417
'..and he'll say that in my possession
there are some important documents.'

01:11:52.833 --> 01:11:55.417
'And he'll also offer you
large amounts of money for it.'

01:11:55.875 --> 01:12:00.125
'And when he does, you will
hand over this envelope to him.'

01:12:09.833 --> 01:12:10.875
Is he mad?

01:12:11.958 --> 01:12:13.917
Where will we get 50 million?

01:12:14.250 --> 01:12:16.500
Vikram Makhija's share was 5O million.

01:12:18.208 --> 01:12:20.625
You must transfer
that to this Swiss account now.

01:12:25.167 --> 01:12:26.958
And what if I don't?

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.083
Well then Russi's asked me to tell you..

01:12:30.292 --> 01:12:33.667
...that you know the
consequences of not complying.

01:12:42.458 --> 01:12:44.375
So under the garb of a patriot..

01:12:44.708 --> 01:12:47.750
...he's just a bloody
blackmailing opportunist.

01:12:48.167 --> 01:12:49.083
Right?

01:12:51.542 --> 01:12:54.083
But what will he do with the money?

01:12:54.375 --> 01:12:56.083
Because according to me..

01:12:56.958 --> 01:13:00.333
...he won't be seeing daylight
for the next 14 years.

01:13:02.167 --> 01:13:04.500
So..
- You don't worry about that.

01:13:04.833 --> 01:13:06.958
Just transfer the money.

01:13:08.167 --> 01:13:13.375
Rusi isn't stupid to hide
such sensitive documents.

01:13:13.458 --> 01:13:16.500
...in the cupboard or inside a pumpkin.

01:13:18.042 --> 01:13:20.417
So he also asked me to tell you..

01:13:20.833 --> 01:13:24.375
...that if you send your
men to our house again..

01:13:25.042 --> 01:13:27.167
...the amount will double up.

01:13:29.625 --> 01:13:31.125
Thank you very much for the evening.

01:13:46.375 --> 01:13:48.458
Something's missing out.

01:13:55.083 --> 01:13:57.000
You didn't write what's in the wallet?

01:13:57.083 --> 01:13:59.083
Patil sir took the inventory.

01:14:25.167 --> 01:14:27.125
Tukiya.
- Yes.

01:14:27.917 --> 01:14:29.875
Check the statement file..

01:14:31.667 --> 01:14:34.667
...and tell me the commander's
movements on 27th April.

01:14:34.875 --> 01:14:37.125
8:15 AM,
the Commander leaves his home.

01:14:37.833 --> 01:14:39.583
8:45 AM, he was on the ship.

01:14:39.875 --> 01:14:41.500
10:00 AM, Imperial Motors.

01:14:41.750 --> 01:14:43.792
And at 10:20 AM,
he was at Vikram's home.

01:14:44.375 --> 01:14:47.083
How long does it take to get
to Imperial Motors from the ship?

01:14:47.500 --> 01:14:48.542
It's close-by.

01:14:48.625 --> 01:14:49.708
10 minutes by car.

01:14:52.708 --> 01:14:57.542
So where was the Commander
from 8:45 to 10:00?

01:15:05.958 --> 01:15:07.458
Madam.
- Yes.

01:15:07.750 --> 01:15:09.542
I need some information.

01:15:09.625 --> 01:15:12.625
I recognized immediately when
I saw his picture in the newspaper.

01:15:12.958 --> 01:15:16.083
That Navy officer made
a lightening trunk call to Delhi.

01:15:16.667 --> 01:15:17.833
'Excuse me.'

01:15:18.833 --> 01:15:21.083
'Please go to booth no. 7.
- Thank you.'

01:15:30.833 --> 01:15:32.625
Sometimes we don't
have the exact change..

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.333
...so we give stamps instead.

01:15:35.417 --> 01:15:37.833
And since these stamps
were launched last week..

01:15:37.917 --> 01:15:39.625
...so I clearly remember them.

01:15:40.833 --> 01:15:42.875
Madam, please give me
the number he called in Delhi.

01:15:43.333 --> 01:15:44.333
Yes, sir.

01:15:54.292 --> 01:15:55.750
We've a problem.

01:15:56.792 --> 01:15:58.500
Rustom's demanding 50 million.

01:15:59.417 --> 01:16:03.417
Rustom! Rustom! Rustom!

01:16:06.292 --> 01:16:10.042
Rustom! Rustom! Rustom!

01:16:12.167 --> 01:16:13.667
How many seats do you want?
- One.

01:16:14.583 --> 01:16:15.625
20 rupees.
- Ok.

01:16:18.625 --> 01:16:24.625
"Unfamiliar is the terrain.."

01:16:25.042 --> 01:16:31.833
"Unknown are the enemies
and the friends."

01:16:31.917 --> 01:16:38.375
"Whether we die to find them or kill."

01:16:38.583 --> 01:16:44.042
"Love is love after all,
despite how we find it."

01:16:46.333 --> 01:16:52.417
"Who cares about right and wrong!"

01:16:52.958 --> 01:16:58.875
"The last man standing is the Rustom."

01:16:59.167 --> 01:17:03.958
Vikram towels, only Rs. 5!

01:17:04.042 --> 01:17:05.583
Holds on even after you're dead.

01:17:05.667 --> 01:17:07.958
It's durable..

01:17:18.167 --> 01:17:21.250
"Love is friendship."

01:17:21.333 --> 01:17:25.792
"Love is the weapon of choice,
for Rustom."

01:17:26.125 --> 01:17:30.708
"Who cares about right and wrong!"

01:17:32.667 --> 01:17:37.875
"The last man standing is the Rustom."

01:17:40.458 --> 01:17:44.875
First of all, I would like
to welcome my jury members.

01:17:46.792 --> 01:17:49.625
There's a huge responsibility
on all of you today..

01:17:50.208 --> 01:17:54.208
...which you must fulfill
with determination and honesty.

01:17:55.167 --> 01:17:58.000
ROP Commander Rustom Pavri..

01:17:58.250 --> 01:18:00.750
...has been accused of
murdering Vikram Makhija.

01:18:01.083 --> 01:18:02.750
The lawyers from both the sides..

01:18:02.792 --> 01:18:07.167
...will present their evidences,
witnesses and arguments before you.

01:18:07.417 --> 01:18:10.208
And you must hear them, understand..

01:18:10.292 --> 01:18:13.125
...and then give your verdict.

01:18:20.833 --> 01:18:23.375
Is Erich Bilimoria
present in the court?

01:18:23.458 --> 01:18:25.083
Yes, your honor.

01:18:25.458 --> 01:18:30.375
You've written in your newspaper
"Will the soldier get justice?".

01:18:30.917 --> 01:18:34.375
Do you deny this?
- No, your honor.

01:18:35.417 --> 01:18:38.292
Do you know that you're
insulting the court..

01:18:38.375 --> 01:18:40.958
...by asking such a question
on a public platform?

01:18:41.208 --> 01:18:44.417
No, I just asked a question,
yourhonon

01:18:44.833 --> 01:18:48.292
By putting a 'question
mark' at the end of a statement..

01:18:48.333 --> 01:18:51.708
...it also makes it an allegation.

01:18:52.500 --> 01:18:56.125
Your question has doubted
the capability of this court.

01:18:56.458 --> 01:18:59.708
And for that you'll
be kept behind bars..

01:18:59.792 --> 01:19:02.042
...until the court proceedings go on.

01:19:02.875 --> 01:19:03.917
Take him away.

01:19:07.083 --> 01:19:09.625
Come on.

01:19:12.167 --> 01:19:14.667
Now the prosecution will
give its opening statement.

01:19:20.167 --> 01:19:23.708
In our constitution,
the law is equal for everyone.

01:19:25.208 --> 01:19:32.417
Whether it's some rich socialite,
or a common man or a soldier.

01:19:33.792 --> 01:19:39.792
Commander Rustom Pavri is
sitting amidst us, in his uniform.

01:19:41.250 --> 01:19:44.542
When he committed the murder
and surrendered himself..

01:19:44.625 --> 01:19:48.958
...he was still in his uniform.

01:19:50.083 --> 01:19:53.458
He's taking complete
advantage of the uniform.

01:19:54.792 --> 01:20:01.792
But you must assess the actions
of the man behind the uniform..

01:20:02.042 --> 01:20:03.875
...and give your judgment.

01:20:05.542 --> 01:20:09.333
On the morning of 27th April,
Rustom Pavri..

01:20:09.667 --> 01:20:14.083
...murdered Vikram Makhija
by firing three bullets at him.

01:20:15.792 --> 01:20:20.750
Prosecution will prove
this fact without any doubt.

01:20:22.583 --> 01:20:23.583
Thank you.

01:20:25.417 --> 01:20:26.500
That's all, your honor.

01:20:29.250 --> 01:20:32.250
Defense, your opening.

01:20:37.625 --> 01:20:42.083
Dear Jury, my uniform is my habit.

01:20:42.875 --> 01:20:45.542
Just like my other
good and bad habits.

01:20:46.250 --> 01:20:50.833
Like breathing..
..protecting my country.

01:20:51.250 --> 01:20:53.000
Unhesitant.. ..selflessly.

01:20:53.083 --> 01:20:54.417
Doing my dUtY-

01:20:59.292 --> 01:21:00.875
I didn't commit any murder.

01:21:01.208 --> 01:21:04.875
And the prosecution itself
will prove this to you.

01:21:08.292 --> 01:21:09.375
Thank you. Thank you my lord.

01:21:12.625 --> 01:21:15.375
Our first witness is Dr. Asher..

01:21:15.708 --> 01:21:19.542
...who's in-charge of the post-mortem
at the government hospital.

01:21:23.292 --> 01:21:29.792
'I swear I will tell the truth,
and nothing but the truth.'

01:21:31.792 --> 01:21:35.708
Dr. Asher, will you please
tell ourjury members..

01:21:35.792 --> 01:21:39.083
...the reason for
Vikram Makhija's death.

01:21:39.542 --> 01:21:43.333
Due to three bullets shot to his heart..
- Thank you, Dr. Asher.

01:21:44.125 --> 01:21:45.917
The jury members should note down..

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:50.917
...that Vikram Makhija died due
to three bullets shot to his heart.

01:21:51.875 --> 01:21:53.542
No further questions, your honor.

01:21:53.625 --> 01:21:56.958
The court requests the prosecution..

01:21:57.042 --> 01:21:58.875
...not to repeat everything.

01:21:59.167 --> 01:22:00.917
The court pays attention
the second time..

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:02.417
...as much as it does the first time.

01:22:03.667 --> 01:22:04.708
Sorry, your honor.

01:22:06.583 --> 01:22:09.083
Defense, your witness please.

01:22:11.917 --> 01:22:13.917
No cross-examination, your honor.

01:22:17.042 --> 01:22:21.375
Ms. Rosy, do you know Commander Pavri?
- Yes.

01:22:21.417 --> 01:22:22.958
He was a friend of my boss..

01:22:23.042 --> 01:22:24.625
...and he's been to
the office number of times.

01:22:24.708 --> 01:22:25.958
I see.

01:22:26.208 --> 01:22:28.958
Did he come to Imperial
Motors on the 27th April?

01:22:29.042 --> 01:22:31.958
Yes. He came at around 9:45.

01:22:32.167 --> 01:22:36.083
Do you remember the expression
on his face when he came in?

01:22:36.667 --> 01:22:39.750
I clearly remember, sir.
He was very angry.

01:22:39.958 --> 01:22:42.792
Seemed like he was ready
to kill someone.

01:22:42.958 --> 01:22:44.625
What did he do next?

01:22:45.042 --> 01:22:48.083
He asked whether Vikram
sir's in the office or not.

01:22:48.167 --> 01:22:49.375
What did you say?

01:22:49.458 --> 01:22:51.458
I said he hasn't arrived yet.

01:22:51.542 --> 01:22:53.792
Then I asked whether
it was something urgent.

01:22:53.875 --> 01:22:54.833
And his reply?

01:22:54.917 --> 01:22:59.708
He said 'No'. 'Nothing urgent,
I just want to kill him.'

01:23:05.458 --> 01:23:08.917
What did he do then?
- He left in a fit of rage.

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:10.083
Thank you.

01:23:11.500 --> 01:23:14.208
Defense. Your witness, please.

01:23:17.167 --> 01:23:23.750
Ms. Rosy, I would request
you to tell the judge and jury..

01:23:23.958 --> 01:23:26.708
...that everything
you just said was a lie.

01:23:26.917 --> 01:23:28.708
Objection, my lord.

01:23:28.792 --> 01:23:32.458
This is misleading,
confusing, vague.. it is..

01:23:32.542 --> 01:23:34.833
It's unintelligible.

01:23:36.500 --> 01:23:40.500
Commander Pavri,
you can't ask that of the witness.

01:23:40.833 --> 01:23:43.542
You have to prove her wrong.

01:23:46.750 --> 01:23:51.500
My lord, I don't want to
prove a lady wrong in the court..

01:23:51.583 --> 01:23:53.375
...and cause her humiliation.

01:23:53.583 --> 01:23:59.917
Commander Pavri, please forget your
navy manners and protocol for a while.

01:24:00.708 --> 01:24:05.042
Imagine that you're a.. a..

01:24:06.083 --> 01:24:10.417
...shameless lawyer,
who can ask the witness anything.

01:24:16.333 --> 01:24:18.542
Ms. Rosy isn't it true that..

01:24:18.625 --> 01:24:22.208
...when I came to the office that day,
you asked me to sit at the reception..

01:24:22.417 --> 01:24:24.208
...and also offered me tea/coffee?

01:24:24.542 --> 01:24:26.083
Yes, it's true.

01:24:26.125 --> 01:24:28.458
So Ms. Rosy, does that mean..

01:24:28.542 --> 01:24:32.083
...you offer tea/coffee to every person
that comes charging in with anger.

01:24:37.042 --> 01:24:38.042
No.

01:24:38.333 --> 01:24:41.625
But when you said you're
going to kill Vikram sir..

01:24:41.875 --> 01:24:46.333
...I thought if you drink tea/coffee,
your anger might calm down.

01:24:48.417 --> 01:24:52.667
Ms. Rosy, you were wearing
a green color blouse that day.

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.167
And you were looking atrocious,
very bad.

01:24:55.417 --> 01:24:58.667
No, that day you said very gorgeous.

01:25:01.083 --> 01:25:04.625
I was in a fit of rage,
I wanted to kill Vikram..

01:25:04.958 --> 01:25:08.292
...and I was also complimenting
you on your outfit.

01:25:10.250 --> 01:25:11.792
Isn't it strange, Ms. Rosy?

01:25:14.708 --> 01:25:17.667
Objection, my lord.
- What for?

01:25:18.167 --> 01:25:19.667
Leading question, your honor.

01:25:19.750 --> 01:25:20.750
Overruled.

01:25:21.417 --> 01:25:25.625
After I left in a fit of rage,
what did you do?

01:25:26.875 --> 01:25:29.875
L.. got busy with my work.

01:25:34.583 --> 01:25:37.083
Didn't you think about
calling the police?

01:25:37.750 --> 01:25:40.042
Objection, my lord.
Calling for conclusion.

01:25:40.125 --> 01:25:41.458
Overruled.

01:25:42.042 --> 01:25:43.208
Thank you, your honor.

01:25:43.583 --> 01:25:45.208
Forget the police..

01:25:45.292 --> 01:25:48.542
After I left, didn't you
think about calling up your boss..

01:25:48.625 --> 01:25:52.250
...and telling him that I
left in a fit of rage to kill him?

01:25:53.625 --> 01:25:54.667
<i>'..</i>

01:25:56.875 --> 01:25:57.958
<i>'..</i>

01:25:58.708 --> 01:26:00.500
I.. I was scared.

01:26:00.583 --> 01:26:02.500
But you just said that you got busy.

01:26:06.500 --> 01:26:08.167
I am very sorry, Ms. Rosy.

01:26:08.458 --> 01:26:10.875
I had to prove you
a liar in this court.

01:26:11.083 --> 01:26:12.708
Objection, my lord.

01:26:13.167 --> 01:26:15.917
The Commander's trying
to mislead the jury..

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:17.417
...by claiming that Ms. Rosy lied.

01:26:17.625 --> 01:26:20.333
But that's exactly
what her statement proves.

01:26:21.583 --> 01:26:23.708
And I am also apologizing
to her for it.

01:26:23.792 --> 01:26:25.167
Your honor, please.

01:26:25.250 --> 01:26:28.042
The Commander should be..
- Mr. Khangnani.

01:26:29.083 --> 01:26:31.042
I think I know what I should do.

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:33.917
I am sorry, your honor.

01:26:35.125 --> 01:26:36.583
Commander Pavri.

01:26:38.833 --> 01:26:41.250
Since you're not
a professional lawyer..

01:26:41.458 --> 01:26:44.000
...that's why I am overlooking
some of your mistakes.

01:26:44.667 --> 01:26:50.167
But I am warning you, please don't
take me or this court for granted.

01:26:51.167 --> 01:26:55.000
Next time you pull a
stunt like this in my court..

01:26:55.917 --> 01:26:57.875
...then I will hold you in contempt.

01:26:59.500 --> 01:27:00.792
Sorry, your honour.

01:27:01.875 --> 01:27:04.667
Jury will disregard
the Commander's last line.

01:27:06.708 --> 01:27:09.417
Our next witness
is sub-inspector Patil..

01:27:09.500 --> 01:27:11.167
...who's the IO of this case.

01:27:19.500 --> 01:27:20.917
But according to the records..

01:27:21.333 --> 01:27:25.042
...the IO of this case
is Senior Inspector Vincent Lobo.

01:27:25.125 --> 01:27:26.125
Where is he?

01:27:26.208 --> 01:27:27.708
Sir, he has urgently gone to Delhi.

01:27:38.125 --> 01:27:40.042
Got an appointment?
- Tomorrow afternoon.

01:27:40.125 --> 01:27:42.208
I don't understand your plan.

01:27:43.875 --> 01:27:46.625
You know he's a big man.
Well-connected too.

01:27:46.792 --> 01:27:49.375
If anything goes wrong, we'll both
get transferred to Andaman-Nicobar.

01:27:49.417 --> 01:27:52.167
We won't. Just keep your mouth closed,
and I'll handle the rest.

01:27:54.042 --> 01:27:58.542
Now I would like to
summon the eye-witness to this case..

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.083
...Banabhai Worli,
to the witness box.

01:28:13.542 --> 01:28:18.125
Banabhai, what happened
on the morning of 27th April?

01:28:19.125 --> 01:28:22.208
At around 1O AM, the doorbell rang.

01:28:24.083 --> 01:28:25.292
'Is Vikram at home?'

01:28:25.375 --> 01:28:26.292
What happened next?

01:28:26.708 --> 01:28:29.750
After a while,
when I went into Vikram's room..

01:28:30.042 --> 01:28:33.125
...I saw that the Commander
was pointing a gun at him.

01:28:33.500 --> 01:28:36.125
And he shot Vikram
three times in front of me.

01:28:37.292 --> 01:28:39.750
In front of you?
- Yes, sir.

01:28:40.042 --> 01:28:42.292
He shot Vikram three
times in front of me.

01:28:48.333 --> 01:28:49.292
What did you do then?

01:28:49.375 --> 01:28:52.042
I asked him, 'What have you done?'

01:28:52.250 --> 01:28:53.583
And what was his answer?

01:28:54.292 --> 01:28:55.292
He said..

01:28:55.542 --> 01:28:59.667
'He had illegitimate relations with
my wife, that's why I killed him'.

01:29:00.625 --> 01:29:02.125
I didn't hear that properly.

01:29:02.208 --> 01:29:04.625
Will you please repeat what he said?

01:29:04.708 --> 01:29:05.542
He said..

01:29:05.625 --> 01:29:09.583
'He had illegitimate relations with
my wife, that's why I killed him'.

01:29:16.375 --> 01:29:18.375
I have no further questions,
yourhonon

01:29:20.417 --> 01:29:22.917
Rustom Pavri, your witness.

01:29:34.750 --> 01:29:39.083
Banabhai, are you completely
sure that you saw me shooting him?

01:29:39.333 --> 01:29:41.958
Yes, sir. Don't you remember?

01:29:42.458 --> 01:29:45.500
You shot Vikram thrice in front of me.

01:29:46.167 --> 01:29:47.583
Banabhai, I ask you again.

01:29:47.667 --> 01:29:52.500
Did you see me point a gun
at Vikram and shoot him in the chest?

01:29:52.792 --> 01:29:54.083
Objection, my lord.

01:29:54.458 --> 01:29:57.000
The Commander is trying
to intimidate the witness.

01:29:57.250 --> 01:29:59.833
Commander Pavri, I think the victim..

01:29:59.917 --> 01:30:05.250
...clearly knows the consequences
of lying in the court.

01:30:06.208 --> 01:30:07.583
I am sorry, your honor.

01:30:10.750 --> 01:30:15.167
Banabhai, what was the condition
of Vikram's room, when you came in?

01:30:15.875 --> 01:30:17.375
The room was completely disrupted.

01:30:18.167 --> 01:30:19.250
Did you have breakfast?

01:30:19.333 --> 01:30:22.333
Irrelevant question, your honor.
- It is relevant.

01:30:22.417 --> 01:30:24.875
Just give me one minute,
and I will prove it to you, your honor.

01:30:26.500 --> 01:30:27.625
Thank you.

01:30:29.167 --> 01:30:32.167
Did you have breakfast?
- Yes, I did.

01:30:33.042 --> 01:30:35.375
What do you normally
eat for breakfast?

01:30:35.667 --> 01:30:38.125
Pancakes, fritters or porridge.

01:30:38.958 --> 01:30:41.708
Are you a vegetarian?
- Yes.

01:30:42.250 --> 01:30:44.250
What did you have
for breakfast that day?

01:30:47.083 --> 01:30:50.375
Well, I don't remember,
but must be one of these things.

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:52.750
Why did you come in the room that day?

01:30:55.750 --> 01:31:00.958
To ask Vikram what
will he have for breakfast?

01:31:12.917 --> 01:31:16.375
Your honor,
according to this picture..

01:31:16.458 --> 01:31:20.000
...there was already sausage, omelet
and toast ready in the kitchen..

01:31:20.167 --> 01:31:21.958
...which was Vikram
Makhija's breakfast.

01:31:22.208 --> 01:31:24.042
And according to his statement..

01:31:24.125 --> 01:31:25.417
...there was no one else in the house.

01:31:25.500 --> 01:31:26.667
Except for these two.

01:31:29.417 --> 01:31:32.500
Banabhai, please don't say..

01:31:33.125 --> 01:31:35.292
...that you were planning
to start eating meat on that day.

01:32:00.833 --> 01:32:02.292
Banabhai?

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:09.042
Forgive me, sir.

01:32:09.417 --> 01:32:11.375
Forgive me.

01:32:11.708 --> 01:32:14.667
Khangnani sir told me to lie.

01:32:15.750 --> 01:32:18.750
I was in the kitchen
when I heard the gunshots.

01:32:19.250 --> 01:32:20.958
And as soon as I ran upstairs..

01:32:21.167 --> 01:32:25.292
...I saw Vikram was
lying on the ground, and..

01:32:25.542 --> 01:32:28.250
...Commander sir was standing
there with a gun in his hand.

01:32:28.625 --> 01:32:33.000
Forgive me. Forgive me.

01:32:36.042 --> 01:32:37.625
No more questions, your honor.

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:47.458
The court is dismissed for the day.

01:32:48.208 --> 01:32:49.542
Mr. Khangnani.

01:32:51.750 --> 01:32:53.583
Will you please come to my chamber?

01:32:55.875 --> 01:32:56.792
Come on.

01:32:56.875 --> 01:32:59.042
Sprinkle some pesticide inside.
The place is infested with mosquitoes.

01:32:59.125 --> 01:33:02.333
Hey man,
this is jail not some hotel room?

01:33:02.625 --> 01:33:04.417
How was the hearing today?
- Too good.

01:33:04.875 --> 01:33:07.042
The Commander outwitted Khangani.

01:33:08.625 --> 01:33:11.292
Someone in the crowd handed me this.

01:33:11.375 --> 01:33:13.250
He's asked you to call immediately.

01:33:13.500 --> 01:33:15.208
Says he has important information.

01:33:26.708 --> 01:33:29.083
5 rupees! 5 rupees! 5 rupees!

01:33:29.167 --> 01:33:32.208
Rosy's a victim of
Vikram Makhija's favors.

01:33:32.292 --> 01:33:34.375
She had an abortion done last year.

01:33:34.458 --> 01:33:37.333
And the child is said
to be Vikram Makhija's.

01:33:37.417 --> 01:33:40.708
Read all about it in our special
edition, along with the evidence.

01:33:40.792 --> 01:33:42.667
Only 5 rupees! Only 5 rupees!

01:33:44.042 --> 01:33:51.250
Rustom! Rustom!

01:33:55.750 --> 01:33:58.750
Good morning.

01:34:02.875 --> 01:34:05.000
The jury has arrived.
Quickly distribute the paper.

01:34:06.458 --> 01:34:09.458
Rustom! Rustom!

01:34:09.833 --> 01:34:11.250
This is for you. It's a free copy.

01:34:12.250 --> 01:34:13.750
This is for you. It's a free copy.

01:34:33.917 --> 01:34:36.375
Is Mr. Erich Bilimoria
present in the court?

01:34:37.792 --> 01:34:39.000
Yes, your honor.

01:34:39.167 --> 01:34:41.167
I warned you yesterday.

01:34:41.875 --> 01:34:46.792
Yet you wrote about the witness
Ms. Rozy's abortion.

01:34:47.333 --> 01:34:49.250
And you also published
her medical report.

01:34:49.333 --> 01:34:52.208
Sir, it's my duty to bring
the truth before the people.

01:34:52.292 --> 01:34:53.500
Duty?

01:34:54.292 --> 01:34:55.458
I see.

01:34:55.708 --> 01:34:58.167
And you also distributed
copies of your newspaper..

01:34:58.458 --> 01:35:00.625
...to the jury members for free.

01:35:01.667 --> 01:35:03.333
I thought they will
get bored sitting there..

01:35:03.417 --> 01:35:05.167
...so they could read something.

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:08.375
Silence.

01:35:08.583 --> 01:35:10.292
Order! Order!

01:35:11.083 --> 01:35:15.000
Mr. Bilimoria, I sentence you to..

01:35:15.167 --> 01:35:19.792
...one day of jail and 100 rupees fine.

01:35:23.250 --> 01:35:24.167
Come on.

01:35:24.667 --> 01:35:25.708
Let's go.

01:35:27.875 --> 01:35:29.125
Silence!

01:35:31.083 --> 01:35:36.125
Jury members, you will
ignore the newspaper statement.

01:35:37.917 --> 01:35:42.375
Your honor,
my next witness is Jamnabai.

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:44.083
I know.

01:35:45.750 --> 01:35:47.125
Jamnabai.

01:35:47.208 --> 01:35:49.875
Is it true that you've been
working at the Commander's house..

01:35:49.958 --> 01:35:54.292
...for the last three years,
and you also live there? - Yes.

01:35:54.958 --> 01:35:59.083
Will you please tell us what happened
in the house on 27th April morning?

01:35:59.333 --> 01:36:01.625
How would I know what
happened in my house?

01:36:02.042 --> 01:36:03.917
I was in Bombay.

01:36:05.083 --> 01:36:06.375
Silence!

01:36:06.708 --> 01:36:08.875
I mean in Commander Pavri's home.

01:36:08.958 --> 01:36:10.375
Oh, you mean this house.

01:36:10.458 --> 01:36:12.000
You should say like that.

01:36:12.125 --> 01:36:15.458
Ma'am arrived in the morning,
she talked to sir..

01:36:15.625 --> 01:36:17.000
...after which sir left.

01:36:18.208 --> 01:36:21.292
Ma'am arrived in the morning?
- Yes.

01:36:22.208 --> 01:36:23.000
What does that mean?

01:36:23.083 --> 01:36:25.208
She wasn't at home for two days.

01:36:25.583 --> 01:36:28.458
And your Commander sir,
he was at home?

01:36:28.792 --> 01:36:31.250
He returned from the sea the next day.

01:36:32.917 --> 01:36:36.875
So didn't he ask who
the madam went out with?

01:36:37.250 --> 01:36:39.083
He never asks such a question.

01:36:41.625 --> 01:36:43.083
What did he do next?

01:36:43.500 --> 01:36:45.667
He went inside,
opened the cupboards..

01:36:45.750 --> 01:36:49.833
...took the letters out,
read them, came out and drank whiskey.

01:36:50.167 --> 01:36:52.708
How do you know it was whiskey?

01:36:53.125 --> 01:36:57.333
Sir, sometimes I take a sip from it.

01:36:58.875 --> 01:36:59.958
Silence!

01:37:03.292 --> 01:37:04.917
What did he do next?

01:37:05.500 --> 01:37:09.667
He chucked madam's
photo-frame in a fit of rage.

01:37:09.750 --> 01:37:12.833
Point to be noted, your honor.

01:37:12.958 --> 01:37:14.875
He chucked the photo frame.

01:37:16.667 --> 01:37:17.667
Sorry, your honor.

01:37:19.625 --> 01:37:24.167
Jamnabai,
why do you think he did such a thing?

01:37:24.375 --> 01:37:25.708
What else would you do?

01:37:25.833 --> 01:37:29.417
If you find out that your wife's
been away from home for two days..

01:37:29.500 --> 01:37:31.833
...with some other man.

01:37:32.042 --> 01:37:33.125
Tell me.

01:37:34.292 --> 01:37:35.292
Silence!

01:37:35.708 --> 01:37:37.333
Order! Order!

01:37:39.208 --> 01:37:45.125
Jamnabai, this case isn't against me,
it's against your master.

01:37:45.542 --> 01:37:48.875
Do you know who that man was?
- Vikram Makhija.

01:37:48.958 --> 01:37:51.708
Why do you have to
twist your questions?

01:37:51.792 --> 01:37:53.500
You could've asked me directly.

01:37:53.583 --> 01:37:58.583
Look, sir. I am not educated like you,
I am illiterate, a bumpkin.

01:37:58.667 --> 01:38:00.500
But I do know that..

01:38:00.583 --> 01:38:05.167
...if a soldier stays away
from his home serving his country..

01:38:05.833 --> 01:38:12.667
...and if another man sleeps with his
wife, then he has no right to live!

01:38:12.917 --> 01:38:16.125
If Rustom sir did shoot him..

01:38:16.208 --> 01:38:18.417
...then he did the right thing.

01:38:22.167 --> 01:38:23.583
Silence!

01:38:24.042 --> 01:38:25.292
Silence!

01:38:27.042 --> 01:38:28.792
Silence! Order!

01:38:30.833 --> 01:38:32.750
Jamnabai.
- Yes, sir.

01:38:32.833 --> 01:38:35.292
The court isn't interested
in your opinion.

01:38:35.542 --> 01:38:38.250
Please just answer the question.

01:38:39.167 --> 01:38:40.625
Okay, sir.

01:38:41.250 --> 01:38:43.417
But you tell me.

01:38:43.500 --> 01:38:48.042
If you find out that your wife
has been sleeping with this lawyer..

01:38:48.125 --> 01:38:49.667
...then what will you do?

01:38:52.375 --> 01:38:53.583
Come on.

01:38:56.250 --> 01:38:58.458
Jamnabai, you too?

01:38:58.833 --> 01:38:59.708
How are you?

01:38:59.958 --> 01:39:01.125
Use this..

01:39:01.750 --> 01:39:03.708
Use it, it will protect
you from mosquito bites.

01:39:03.833 --> 01:39:04.917
Take it.

01:39:06.917 --> 01:39:08.292
Apply it, all over.

01:39:10.917 --> 01:39:14.042
Did you know about the relation
between Vikram and Cynthia?

01:39:14.417 --> 01:39:15.292
Yes.

01:39:15.583 --> 01:39:19.333
She was quite impressed
by Vikram and his lifestyle.

01:39:19.500 --> 01:39:21.167
And what was Vikram's reaction?

01:39:22.417 --> 01:39:24.000
Vikram was a man.

01:39:24.333 --> 01:39:28.875
And if a woman repeatedly sends
signals to a man, then naturally, he..

01:39:28.958 --> 01:39:33.875
You mean to say, that Cynthia took
the initiative in the relationship?

01:39:34.208 --> 01:39:35.333
Of course.

01:39:36.750 --> 01:39:38.583
I've no further questions, your honor.

01:39:40.667 --> 01:39:43.333
Commander Pavri, your witness, please.

01:39:43.792 --> 01:39:47.417
My lord, I would like to
cross-examine Ms. Preeti later.

01:39:49.958 --> 01:39:50.833
Thank you.

01:39:52.458 --> 01:39:56.083
Your honor, our next witness is
Mrs. Cynthia Pavri.

01:40:00.917 --> 01:40:02.083
Mrs. Pavri..

01:40:03.458 --> 01:40:08.500
...did you have illegitimate
relations with Vikram Makhija, or not?

01:40:27.167 --> 01:40:27.875
Yes.

01:40:52.583 --> 01:40:55.208
Commander Pavri, your witness, please.

01:41:09.542 --> 01:41:11.333
Short while ago,
Ms. Preeti said that..

01:41:11.417 --> 01:41:13.958
...you took initiative in
having a relation with Vikram.

01:41:14.958 --> 01:41:16.208
Is it true?

01:41:19.292 --> 01:41:20.458
No.

01:41:22.125 --> 01:41:24.042
It was Vikram who took the first step.

01:41:25.083 --> 01:41:27.292
And the conditions
were such that it happened.

01:41:28.875 --> 01:41:32.500
What were the conditions under
which you had a relation with Vikram?

01:42:06.500 --> 01:42:08.833
After that, I stayed
away from Vikram.

01:42:10.375 --> 01:42:13.750
Vikram wrote letters to me,
he sent me gifts.

01:42:16.542 --> 01:42:20.000
But I had decided to
end my relation with Vikram.

01:42:21.042 --> 01:42:22.958
Is it because I was coming back?

01:42:24.375 --> 01:42:25.417
No.

01:42:28.458 --> 01:42:30.833
I wasn't going to hide this from you.

01:42:32.917 --> 01:42:35.750
I knew what I did was wrong.

01:42:35.833 --> 01:42:37.292
Objection, my lord.

01:42:39.792 --> 01:42:42.583
I was wondering whether
you're feeling alright or not.

01:42:45.208 --> 01:42:46.250
Sustained.

01:42:50.917 --> 01:42:53.000
On 27th April,
when you returned home..

01:42:53.583 --> 01:42:55.333
...you were wounded on the head.

01:42:56.542 --> 01:42:58.417
Will you tell the court what happened?

01:43:24.125 --> 01:43:26.667
Vikram, we'll never meet again.

01:43:27.708 --> 01:43:31.542
And it'll be better if
you don't contact me again.

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:42.000
Fine.

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:55.833
Will you tell Rustom about us,
or should I?

01:43:59.500 --> 01:44:00.875
This is not a joke, darling.

01:44:01.208 --> 01:44:02.208
What did you think?

01:44:03.333 --> 01:44:07.000
We had this relation
because I am crazy about you.

01:44:08.042 --> 01:44:08.917
Wrong.

01:44:09.750 --> 01:44:12.625
I wanted to take
revenge from your husband.

01:44:14.500 --> 01:44:17.500
Once he showed me
the power of his uniform.

01:44:18.417 --> 01:44:22.500
And now..
I showed the power of money..

01:44:23.708 --> 01:44:25.375
...and got you here.

01:44:29.750 --> 01:44:31.292
This is real power.

01:44:33.208 --> 01:44:34.250
Sweetheart.

01:44:36.875 --> 01:44:38.667
Don't be mistaken.

01:44:39.292 --> 01:44:42.583
No matter how hard you try,
or how much money you earn..

01:44:43.042 --> 01:44:46.833
...a sleazy man like you can
never be anything like Rustom.

01:44:47.042 --> 01:44:48.583
You lousy piece of..

01:45:19.292 --> 01:45:24.708
Do you blame Vikram
for what happened with you?

01:45:27.625 --> 01:45:29.042
No, only myself.

01:45:30.583 --> 01:45:32.958
I shouldn't have broken your trust.

01:45:39.917 --> 01:45:43.417
Do you have any remorse
for what happened?

01:45:43.750 --> 01:45:45.083
Objection, my lord.

01:45:45.542 --> 01:45:46.917
This is irrelevant.

01:45:47.667 --> 01:45:48.958
Overruled.

01:46:43.875 --> 01:46:48.000
My lord, I would now like
to cross-examine Ms. Preeti Makhija.

01:46:50.208 --> 01:46:54.917
Ms. Preeti, did Vikram
always carry his gun with him?

01:46:55.208 --> 01:46:57.208
He had a licensed gun.

01:46:57.583 --> 01:47:01.042
But I don't know whether
he always carried it or not.

01:47:01.250 --> 01:47:03.917
I am sure you know
that he had a short-temper.

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:06.125
He would draw his gun
over every trivial matter.

01:47:06.208 --> 01:47:08.292
Am I right?
- Not true at all.

01:47:13.042 --> 01:47:14.042
Forget that.

01:47:14.375 --> 01:47:15.583
Tell me..

01:47:16.542 --> 01:47:18.792
...did your brother like poetry?

01:47:19.292 --> 01:47:21.125
Yes, he did.

01:47:21.750 --> 01:47:22.542
Good.

01:47:30.708 --> 01:47:34.125
Your honor, this diary
was recovered from his bedroom.

01:47:34.417 --> 01:47:35.917
Can you take a look and tell me..

01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:38.667
...whether this is your
brother's handwriting or not?

01:47:38.750 --> 01:47:39.958
Please.

01:47:51.125 --> 01:47:54.708
Ms. Preeti, will you read
this letter aloud, please.

01:47:58.583 --> 01:48:00.042
'My dear Cynthia..'

01:48:00.125 --> 01:48:03.792
Ms. Preeti, louder.
Everyone must hear it.

01:48:07.125 --> 01:48:11.583
'I thought you were a modern
girl who was raised in London.'

01:48:11.917 --> 01:48:15.667
'I don't think you
should feel guilty at all.'

01:48:16.292 --> 01:48:18.667
'Rustom spends months at sea.'

01:48:18.833 --> 01:48:20.625
'He travels to foreign ports.'

01:48:20.792 --> 01:48:24.625
'He has his share of fun,
and I know that.'

01:48:24.917 --> 01:48:26.208
That's okay.

01:48:26.875 --> 01:48:28.042
Now, read this one.

01:48:30.083 --> 01:48:31.500
And read it from here.

01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:37.833
'You've no reason to be scared.'

01:48:44.458 --> 01:48:45.583
Go ahead.

01:48:52.333 --> 01:48:54.208
'Just like a man,
even a woman can have..'

01:48:54.292 --> 01:48:58.333
'..relations with more than
one man without feeling guilty.'

01:48:58.417 --> 01:49:00.000
That should be okay, thank you.

01:49:20.458 --> 01:49:22.000
Think about it again.

01:49:31.333 --> 01:49:32.333
Please come in.

01:49:33.542 --> 01:49:36.625
Ramesh Shirke, OSD Home Department.

01:49:37.167 --> 01:49:38.292
Sir!

01:49:38.625 --> 01:49:40.042
How can I help you?

01:49:40.542 --> 01:49:44.542
Bakshi sir, this is senior
inspector Vincent Lobo, Bombay Police.

01:49:45.208 --> 01:49:47.500
He's investigating
Vikram Makhija murder.

01:49:47.833 --> 01:49:50.417
And wants to speak to
you regarding the case.

01:49:51.167 --> 01:49:52.125
I see.

01:49:52.625 --> 01:49:55.917
Actually you won't believe this,
but I've been half expecting you.

01:49:56.292 --> 01:49:57.917
And I am glad you are here.

01:49:58.458 --> 01:50:01.417
First time I am hearing
someone's glad to see the police.

01:50:03.333 --> 01:50:05.333
What would you like to have?
Tea or coffee?

01:50:05.583 --> 01:50:07.250
By the way, they make really good tea.

01:50:11.917 --> 01:50:13.000
Get two cups of tea.

01:50:14.333 --> 01:50:15.292
Come, Mr. Lobo.

01:50:19.542 --> 01:50:20.875
Please.

01:50:21.083 --> 01:50:21.875
Yes, sir.

01:50:41.125 --> 01:50:46.667
The day he murdered Vikram Makhija,
he had telephone me in my office.

01:50:47.875 --> 01:50:49.042
And told me all this.

01:50:50.125 --> 01:50:51.958
But he made one mistake.

01:50:52.542 --> 01:50:56.167
He didn't know that all the calls
to the Defense Ministry are recorded.

01:50:57.417 --> 01:51:01.542
And this will, without any doubt,
prove Rustom's guilt.

01:51:03.875 --> 01:51:05.917
Sir, can I get a copy of this?

01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:07.792
Yes, of course. This one's for you.
- Thank you, sir.

01:51:07.875 --> 01:51:12.125
But sir, why didn't you
handover this evidence personally?

01:51:12.542 --> 01:51:14.667
Rustom is a decorated officer..

01:51:15.208 --> 01:51:18.417
...and there are certain
things that you earn, Mr. Lobo.

01:51:21.917 --> 01:51:26.667
And now you have something,
that you've earned rightfully.

01:51:27.875 --> 01:51:28.750
Thank you, sir.

01:51:33.833 --> 01:51:37.292
50 million transferred
to Rustom's said account.

01:51:45.708 --> 01:51:47.875
Madam, one ticket for the
10:00 AM flight to Bombay.

01:51:48.083 --> 01:51:50.292
Sorry sir, the 10:00 AM
flight is sold out.

01:51:50.375 --> 01:51:52.583
I can accommodate you
on the 02:00 PM flight.

01:51:56.583 --> 01:51:57.625
Okay.

01:52:19.667 --> 01:52:20.625
Get inside.

01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:22.500
Sit quietly in the corner.

01:52:25.042 --> 01:52:28.708
The prosecution wants to question
Commander Rustom Pavri, my lord.

01:52:32.750 --> 01:52:34.292
So tell me, Commander.

01:52:34.500 --> 01:52:38.333
When you found out about
your wife's illegitimate relation..

01:52:39.125 --> 01:52:41.958
...what was the first
thought that crossed your mind?

01:52:42.583 --> 01:52:44.042
To murder Vikram.

01:52:54.417 --> 01:52:56.083
Isn't this thinking wrong?

01:52:56.333 --> 01:52:57.583
Not according to me, it's not.

01:52:57.750 --> 01:53:01.458
Why? Do you have a different
point of view from others?

01:53:03.833 --> 01:53:07.167
I am an officer of the Indian Navy.

01:53:07.875 --> 01:53:12.167
And even today being late
is considered a serious offence.

01:53:12.875 --> 01:53:15.250
Under such conditions, having
an affair with your friend's wife..

01:53:15.333 --> 01:53:16.833
...is an unpardonable offense..

01:53:17.083 --> 01:53:20.542
...and assaulting a
woman is a bigger offense.

01:53:20.750 --> 01:53:22.542
And Vikram committed
both these mistakes.

01:53:22.875 --> 01:53:25.542
A man like Vikram
has no right to live.

01:53:28.208 --> 01:53:29.542
Silence!

01:53:30.292 --> 01:53:32.208
Silence!

01:53:32.500 --> 01:53:33.583
Silence!

01:53:35.708 --> 01:53:39.750
And that's why you killed Vikram Makhija.
- No.

01:53:40.083 --> 01:53:42.125
I only answered your question..

01:53:42.292 --> 01:53:44.292
...that such a man
has no right to live.

01:53:44.917 --> 01:53:47.000
But my intention wasn't to kill him.

01:53:47.208 --> 01:53:48.458
Then what was it?

01:53:48.625 --> 01:53:52.667
I only wanted to know
why he did this to me.

01:53:53.042 --> 01:53:57.042
And to know that, you withdrew
a gun from the ship's armory.

01:53:57.583 --> 01:53:58.667
Your honor..

01:53:59.083 --> 01:54:02.000
...I would like to call Lt. Bisht.

01:54:04.875 --> 01:54:08.292
On 27th April, you were the
'Officer Of The Day' on INS Mysore.

01:54:08.458 --> 01:54:12.833
And in your presence,
I took a gun from Mys0re's armory.

01:54:12.917 --> 01:54:14.833
Am I right?
- Yes, sir.

01:54:15.167 --> 01:54:19.250
Lt. Bisht, that day when
I withdrew a gun from the armory..

01:54:19.333 --> 01:54:23.458
...did you ask me to sign the register?
- No, sir.

01:54:23.750 --> 01:54:25.042
You asked for the register.

01:54:25.125 --> 01:54:29.208
And could I have withdrawn
this gun from the armory..

01:54:29.458 --> 01:54:32.042
...without anyone's knowledge?

01:54:32.125 --> 01:54:33.333
Of course you could, sir.

01:54:33.708 --> 01:54:35.500
In fact, as the XO of the ship..

01:54:35.583 --> 01:54:37.708
...you always have
a second set of keys.

01:54:37.917 --> 01:54:40.208
You could've withdrawn
the gun if you wanted..

01:54:40.292 --> 01:54:44.167
...used it, and kept it
back, without anybody knowing.

01:54:44.542 --> 01:54:46.792
Kudos!

01:54:46.875 --> 01:54:48.125
Silence.

01:54:49.958 --> 01:54:51.542
Silence. Silence.

01:54:53.667 --> 01:54:55.958
I only took the gun
for my self-defense.

01:54:56.375 --> 01:54:58.625
Because Vikram would
lose his temper easily.

01:54:58.792 --> 01:55:01.083
And he would draw his
gun for every trivial matter.

01:55:01.250 --> 01:55:03.167
This is something completely new.

01:55:04.375 --> 01:55:06.875
Do you have any way to prove this?

01:55:06.958 --> 01:55:10.958
I would now like to call
Mr. Ranjit Das to prove my point.

01:55:19.792 --> 01:55:21.500
Mr. Das, what do you do?

01:55:22.833 --> 01:55:25.333
I am the senior waiter
at the Wellingdon Gymkhana now.

01:55:25.542 --> 01:55:27.583
Before that I was
a bearer at the CCI club.

01:55:28.083 --> 01:55:31.250
Do you know Vikram Makhija?
- Very well.

01:55:31.333 --> 01:55:33.292
He was a regular member of our club.

01:55:33.583 --> 01:55:37.917
Last year in January,
an incident occurred with you.

01:55:38.375 --> 01:55:40.625
Will you please tell
the court what happened?

01:55:43.458 --> 01:55:48.833
That day Vikram Makhija,
you, your wife and Preeti madam..

01:55:49.208 --> 01:55:51.417
...were all playing
Bridge in the boardroom.

01:55:53.333 --> 01:55:56.167
Have you finished packing for London?
- Yeah.

01:55:58.000 --> 01:55:59.667
By the way,
I am coming there too next month.

01:56:00.500 --> 01:56:02.750
You're going to stay at
the Wicker's Guest house, right?

01:56:04.708 --> 01:56:05.833
How do you know?

01:56:07.500 --> 01:56:08.333
Sorry, sir.

01:56:08.542 --> 01:56:10.167
I am very sorry, sir.
- You bas***

01:56:10.542 --> 01:56:13.292
It was a mistake, sir.
Please don't abuse me.

01:56:13.917 --> 01:56:16.833
You bloody bas***, how dare you?

01:56:17.042 --> 01:56:20.125
Wait.. Enough, control yourself.

01:56:20.500 --> 01:56:21.417
You go. Go.

01:56:21.500 --> 01:56:24.667
Just leave me, I will kill this bloody..
- Vikram, no.

01:56:25.083 --> 01:56:26.083
Stop it.

01:56:26.500 --> 01:56:28.667
So according to your statement..

01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:32.833
...you dropped juice on Vikram
Makhija's shoes by mistake..

01:56:32.917 --> 01:56:37.167
...and he drew out his gun
and pointed at you. - Yes.

01:56:38.583 --> 01:56:39.958
That's all, your honor.

01:56:40.417 --> 01:56:44.167
Your honor, I want to ask
Mr. Das just one question.

01:56:48.417 --> 01:56:51.333
Other than the
Commander and his wife..

01:56:51.542 --> 01:56:56.417
...is there any other
witness who can prove..

01:56:56.833 --> 01:57:00.542
...that everything happened
the way you said it?

01:57:05.417 --> 01:57:07.625
I don't have more questions for him,
yourhonon

01:57:07.833 --> 01:57:08.917
You can go.

01:57:09.792 --> 01:57:11.708
Hold on, Mr. Das. Just a minute.

01:57:14.583 --> 01:57:20.333
Mr. Das, when such an
incident occurs in big clubs..

01:57:20.417 --> 01:57:22.792
...then how do the
club officials tackle it?

01:57:23.542 --> 01:57:25.333
They order an enquiry for it.

01:57:25.542 --> 01:57:29.000
And the club's committee performs
a detailed investigation of the case.

01:57:30.625 --> 01:57:31.667
My lord..

01:57:34.042 --> 01:57:36.125
...there was an enquiry
after that incident as well.

01:57:36.792 --> 01:57:38.708
These clubs are more
than 5O years old..

01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:41.250
...and they take their
tradition quite seriously.

01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:46.208
They suspended Vikram Makhija's
membership until the enquiry.

01:57:46.417 --> 01:57:48.375
And only after an apology
note and his influence..

01:57:48.458 --> 01:57:51.083
...they reinstated his membership.

01:57:58.708 --> 01:58:01.000
This is the club's
minutes of meeting file.

01:58:01.333 --> 01:58:03.333
And this is a copy
of the apology note..

01:58:03.375 --> 01:58:05.958
...where Vikram Makhija
has clearly said that..

01:58:06.042 --> 01:58:09.208
...he drew his gun in
a fit of rage and he also assured..

01:58:09.292 --> 01:58:14.083
...the members of the club that
he will never do such a thing again.

01:58:29.917 --> 01:58:33.292
This apology note and
Mr. Das' statement proves..

01:58:33.375 --> 01:58:36.042
...that Vikram would lose
his temper over trivial things..

01:58:36.125 --> 01:58:38.292
...and draw his gun out.

01:58:39.833 --> 01:58:43.000
Since I had seen his behavior before..

01:58:43.208 --> 01:58:46.167
...I thought it would be
right to take my gun along too.

01:58:46.917 --> 01:58:49.958
And that day,
when I went to speak to Vikram.

01:58:51.958 --> 01:58:52.792
Vikram.

01:59:03.750 --> 01:59:05.083
What's the matter, Commander sir?

01:59:05.333 --> 01:59:06.542
So early in the morning?

01:59:08.500 --> 01:59:09.667
Will you..

01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:14.792
...marry Cynthia?
- What?

01:59:16.458 --> 01:59:19.625
Will I marry every woman I sleep with?

01:59:19.792 --> 01:59:20.875
Behave, Vikram.

01:59:23.125 --> 01:59:26.125
Don't forget,
Rustom, that you're in my home.

01:59:26.833 --> 01:59:28.875
And if I want..
- What can you do?

02:00:34.542 --> 02:00:39.625
I fired.. but, my lord,
only in self-defense.

02:00:46.042 --> 02:00:50.667
Commander, was it necessary
to fire three times in self-defense?

02:00:52.500 --> 02:00:54.792
To explain that,
I must show you something.

02:00:55.750 --> 02:00:57.208
May I, my lord?

02:00:58.417 --> 02:00:59.333
Thank you.

02:01:02.625 --> 02:01:05.917
Khangnani sir, this is the
Indian Navy basic training manual.

02:01:09.167 --> 02:01:11.792
Ma'am, will you please
turn to page no. 24?

02:01:15.625 --> 02:01:17.292
'Close Combat Situations.'

02:01:17.500 --> 02:01:20.292
Now, will you please
read the methods written here?

02:01:21.375 --> 02:01:26.375
The Navy says Hit First,
Hit Hard and Keep Hitting.

02:01:26.667 --> 02:01:29.375
If someone's pointing the gun at you..

02:01:29.625 --> 02:01:31.750
...then you can shoot
without any hesitation.

02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:35.208
And you will fire in
a burst of three bullets.

02:01:35.417 --> 02:01:37.167
Thank you very much, ma'am.

02:01:39.083 --> 02:01:44.708
My lord, what I did was just a
reflex action because of my training.

02:01:57.583 --> 02:02:00.833
Commander,
according to your fictitious story..

02:02:01.125 --> 02:02:04.542
...you and Vikram had a struggle.
- Yes.

02:02:04.750 --> 02:02:08.417
So what can be the reason
that even after a fierce struggle.

02:02:08.625 --> 02:02:11.708
...Vikram Makhija's
towel stayed on his body?

02:02:12.792 --> 02:02:14.417
And according to the police report..

02:02:14.500 --> 02:02:17.417
...there wasn't a single speck
of dust on your white uniform.

02:02:19.500 --> 02:02:21.250
Khangnani sir,
do you want to say that..

02:02:21.333 --> 02:02:26.292
...I went to Vikram's room,
and personally disrupted his stuff..

02:02:26.375 --> 02:02:31.667
...then I took my gun out and shot
Vikram, then I took Vikram's gun..

02:02:31.750 --> 02:02:34.250
...cocked it and kept it in his hand?

02:02:34.458 --> 02:02:37.875
And you're saying all this because
there was no dust on my uniform..

02:02:37.958 --> 02:02:40.208
...and Vikram's towel
was still on his body!

02:02:41.125 --> 02:02:42.583
Come on, Khangnani sir..

02:02:42.750 --> 02:02:44.958
...we were not
wrestling in the mud.

02:02:48.875 --> 02:02:50.333
Order! Order!

02:02:55.542 --> 02:02:57.542
I have no more witnesses
to examine, your honor.

02:02:57.792 --> 02:02:59.125
I now rest my case.

02:02:59.375 --> 02:03:00.208
Thank you.

02:03:15.750 --> 02:03:19.083
Jury members,
you heard the arguments from both..

02:03:19.167 --> 02:03:20.375
Excuse me, my lord!

02:03:28.333 --> 02:03:30.583
I am senior inspector
Vincent Lobo, sir.

02:03:32.625 --> 02:03:35.000
I've an important piece
of evidence regarding this case..

02:03:35.083 --> 02:03:38.042
...which I would like to
share with the public prosecutor“.

02:03:38.125 --> 02:03:39.542
...with your permission, sir.

02:04:09.750 --> 02:04:14.625
Your honor, inspector Lobo
has acquired this evidence..

02:04:14.708 --> 02:04:16.500
...through his brilliant investigation.

02:04:16.750 --> 02:04:20.000
I would like to request the
court to admit this as evidence.

02:04:20.417 --> 02:04:21.625
What is this evidence?

02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:24.958
The day Commander
murdered Vikram Makhija..

02:04:25.667 --> 02:04:30.125
...that day he made a trunk-call
to Delhi from the GPO.

02:04:30.625 --> 02:04:34.167
And he never mentioned this to anyone,
and hid it from everyone.

02:04:35.042 --> 02:04:37.917
Since the call was made
to the Defense Secretary..

02:04:38.167 --> 02:04:40.458
...the call was recorded.

02:04:41.125 --> 02:04:44.667
And we would like to
present that recording.

02:04:46.042 --> 02:04:47.375
Commander Pavri.

02:04:48.958 --> 02:04:49.875
Yes, your honor.

02:04:49.958 --> 02:04:51.250
Any objection?

02:04:51.417 --> 02:04:52.583
Not at all, your honor.

02:05:11.458 --> 02:05:13.500
Sir, lightening trunk
call for you from Bombay.

02:05:13.583 --> 02:05:14.333
Please speak here.

02:05:14.417 --> 02:05:15.417
The party is on the line.

02:05:15.500 --> 02:05:17.625
Good morning, sir.
- Who's this?

02:05:17.708 --> 02:05:18.750
Commander Rustom Pavri.

02:05:18.917 --> 02:05:21.458
Rustom, how are you?
When did you return?

02:05:21.542 --> 02:05:22.125
Sir, l..

02:05:22.208 --> 02:05:24.792
Yes, I know why you called.

02:05:24.875 --> 02:05:28.792
I will tell Vikram to meet
you and sort out this matter.

02:05:28.875 --> 02:05:32.542
I am going to meet him,
and I'm not going to spare him.

02:05:40.583 --> 02:05:42.500
Silence! Silence!

02:05:42.792 --> 02:05:44.375
Silence! Silence!

02:05:49.333 --> 02:05:54.167
Commander Pavri,
do you agree this is your voice?

02:05:54.833 --> 02:05:55.958
Yes.

02:05:56.708 --> 02:05:59.417
What else is there to prove,
yourhonon

02:06:00.583 --> 02:06:02.375
Commander Pavri came home.

02:06:02.792 --> 02:06:06.292
He found out that his wife's
having an affair with Vikram Makhija.

02:06:06.792 --> 02:06:08.333
He went to his ship.

02:06:08.417 --> 02:06:10.208
Withdrew a gun from the armory.

02:06:10.583 --> 02:06:14.667
And he called Defense Secretary
K.G. Bakshi on the phone..

02:06:14.708 --> 02:06:16.292
...that 'l won't spare him'.

02:06:16.750 --> 02:06:19.292
Saying that, he went
to Vikram Makhija's home..

02:06:19.375 --> 02:06:22.625
...and shot him brutally thrice!

02:06:26.958 --> 02:06:29.250
This is no 'heat
of the moment' incident.

02:06:29.333 --> 02:06:32.083
It's a clear case
of pre-determined murder.

02:06:36.708 --> 02:06:41.292
Commander Pavri, would you
like to comment on this evidence?

02:06:43.000 --> 02:06:46.875
My lord, I would like to ask
Mr. Khangnani..

02:06:46.958 --> 02:06:52.292
...in which dictionary does 'I won't
spare him' means 'I will kill him'?

02:06:53.208 --> 02:06:59.083
Commander Pavri, let's not turn this
into a game of words and make excuses.

02:06:59.917 --> 02:07:02.833
The context in which
you used these words..

02:07:02.917 --> 02:07:06.458
...and the incidents that followed
afterwards, clearly indicates..

02:07:06.542 --> 02:07:10.958
...what 'I won't spare him' means here.

02:07:19.958 --> 02:07:21.292
Come on, Commander Pavri.

02:07:21.375 --> 02:07:22.875
You planned everything..

02:07:22.958 --> 02:07:26.167
...and cold-heartedly
murdered Vikram Makhija!

02:07:26.458 --> 02:07:27.292
Admit it!

02:07:38.167 --> 02:07:42.417
Commander Pavri,
do you have a closing statement.

02:07:54.708 --> 02:07:55.667
No, your honor.

02:07:55.875 --> 02:07:57.667
I already said what I had to.

02:07:57.958 --> 02:08:02.042
I too rest my case, thank you.

02:08:05.083 --> 02:08:06.417
Silence. Silence.

02:08:14.375 --> 02:08:15.333
Jury members.

02:08:17.333 --> 02:08:19.708
You heard the arguments
from both sides.

02:08:20.500 --> 02:08:22.667
You saw their witnesses and evidences.

02:08:23.375 --> 02:08:25.333
Now you must decide.

02:08:25.667 --> 02:08:28.375
Remember, the decision
must be in majority.

02:08:29.167 --> 02:08:32.417
And for that,
you have no restriction of time.

02:08:35.417 --> 02:08:40.000
The jury's verdict will
be announced tomorrow.

02:08:44.167 --> 02:08:45.833
The case has been handed to the jury.

02:08:48.917 --> 02:08:50.958
Thank you to all of
you for selecting me..

02:08:51.042 --> 02:08:52.583
...as the jury's foreperson.

02:08:52.708 --> 02:08:54.417
Before starting
with the arguments..

02:08:54.500 --> 02:08:56.542
...let us conduct an informal vote.
- Yes.

02:08:57.708 --> 02:08:58.750
Let's start with you.

02:08:58.833 --> 02:09:00.125
Of course, not guilty.

02:09:00.208 --> 02:09:01.000
Where is the doubt?

02:09:01.083 --> 02:09:03.500
Of course, guilty.
- Definitely not guilty.

02:09:03.750 --> 02:09:05.042
Not guilty!

02:09:06.542 --> 02:09:07.500
Don't know.

02:09:07.583 --> 02:09:08.542
Guilty!

02:09:09.167 --> 02:09:10.125
Not guilty.

02:09:10.375 --> 02:09:11.542
Guilty!

02:09:13.292 --> 02:09:14.750
Even I am not sure.

02:09:18.167 --> 02:09:21.042
Three members say that
Commander Pavri is guilty.

02:09:21.375 --> 02:09:23.792
Four members are saying
that he's not guilty.

02:09:24.083 --> 02:09:26.417
And two are still undecided.

02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:29.000
So, let's start the discussion.

02:09:31.042 --> 02:09:32.667
Conviction is guaranteed!

02:09:33.750 --> 02:09:35.083
Hanged to Death or life sentence.

02:09:35.167 --> 02:09:37.750
According to me, he should
be hanged for this murder.

02:09:37.833 --> 02:09:41.208
This is not a murder!
It is self-defense!

02:09:45.083 --> 02:09:46.625
Even if he did commit this murder..

02:09:46.708 --> 02:09:48.292
...he's still a honorable murderer!

02:09:48.375 --> 02:09:50.167
But he's still a murderer.
- No!

02:09:50.250 --> 02:09:52.083
I've decided my vote.

02:09:53.042 --> 02:09:54.333
Guilty.
- Yes.

02:10:13.625 --> 02:10:16.958
Mr. Nayar, If he did want to kill
him, he could've done it anywhere.

02:10:17.042 --> 02:10:19.125
Do you understand that?
- Yes.

02:10:27.667 --> 02:10:30.875
It was self-defense!
- It was planned murder..

02:10:30.958 --> 02:10:32.917
Stop it!

02:10:33.000 --> 02:10:34.125
Calm down!

02:10:34.208 --> 02:10:35.583
Stop fighting-

02:10:36.083 --> 02:10:37.792
Khanna sir is right.

02:10:40.292 --> 02:10:43.792
I change my vote to 'Not guilty'.

02:10:57.917 --> 02:11:01.583
What is the matter, Commander?
Not sleepy?

02:11:02.042 --> 02:11:03.625
Neither are you.

02:11:04.708 --> 02:11:06.208
Let's play one round.

02:11:17.250 --> 02:11:18.625
No, Commander.

02:11:20.167 --> 02:11:23.083
You must've already understood
by now that I don't like losing.

02:11:24.333 --> 02:11:26.708
You beat me at chess that day.

02:11:27.250 --> 02:11:29.583
Today, I levelled
the scores in court.

02:11:31.583 --> 02:11:33.417
Commander, you've lost this game.

02:11:36.708 --> 02:11:43.917
Though I'll always regret not
having heard the truth from you.

02:11:47.375 --> 02:11:50.833
It'd be wrong if I'm your
cause of regret, Mr. Lobo.

02:11:52.750 --> 02:11:57.250
You don't appear to be
too happy about your victory.

02:11:59.833 --> 02:12:01.292
And you're unable to sleep..

02:12:01.375 --> 02:12:06.042
...because you know that
something is wrong somewhere.

02:12:09.458 --> 02:12:10.583
Let me help you.

02:12:12.208 --> 02:12:15.125
Mr. Lobo,
this story began a year ago.

02:12:16.792 --> 02:12:19.125
Vikram had many
contacts in the Navy.

02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:22.250
And the day he found
out that an aircraft carrier..

02:12:22.333 --> 02:12:25.000
...is lying incomplete in England,
he made a plan..

02:12:25.833 --> 02:12:30.833
...along with my senior,
Rear Admiral Kamath.

02:12:31.125 --> 02:12:33.167
And they posted me in London.

02:13:15.917 --> 02:13:18.750
When I inspected
the aircraft carrier..

02:13:19.958 --> 02:13:21.458
...it was rotten.

02:13:22.417 --> 02:13:23.958
I raised an objection.

02:13:27.000 --> 02:13:28.708
Rustom, don't worry.

02:13:28.917 --> 02:13:31.167
We're getting this aircraft
carrier at half the price.

02:13:31.333 --> 02:13:32.875
Once it arrives in lndia..

02:13:32.958 --> 02:13:35.833
...we'll make all the changes
that you've recommended.

02:13:37.500 --> 02:13:39.042
Aah, Vikram is here.

02:13:39.250 --> 02:13:40.625
He will explain you everything.

02:13:41.042 --> 02:13:41.917
Relax.

02:13:47.208 --> 02:13:48.333
One scotch, please.

02:13:54.250 --> 02:13:55.333
Make a good report.

02:13:57.208 --> 02:13:59.042
And I'll give on
one million for it.

02:14:01.292 --> 02:14:02.667
How much are you getting?

02:14:04.958 --> 02:14:06.375
No point in hiding it from you.

02:14:07.583 --> 02:14:08.708
5O million.

02:14:09.250 --> 02:14:10.167
Rustom.

02:14:12.458 --> 02:14:13.958
Think about it, Rustom.

02:14:14.333 --> 02:14:15.625
You're too small up the chain.

02:14:16.167 --> 02:14:17.708
I have other ways.

02:14:34.417 --> 02:14:37.167
I decided to take up this
issue with the higher authorities.

02:14:37.583 --> 02:14:40.375
Because Rear Admiral Kamath
was involved in this scam..

02:14:40.583 --> 02:14:44.958
...so I went to meet Defense Secretary
Bakshi, he was in London at that time.

02:14:45.042 --> 02:14:46.083
Come, Rustom.

02:14:46.417 --> 02:14:48.125
So what was so important?

02:14:48.333 --> 02:14:49.625
Sir, I am sorry to inform you..

02:14:49.708 --> 02:14:52.208
...but there's a lot going
on regarding the aircraft carrier.

02:14:52.875 --> 02:14:54.208
The entire carrier has rusted.

02:14:54.292 --> 02:14:56.458
Did you tell your
superiors about this?

02:14:56.917 --> 02:14:59.708
Yes, sir. I told Rear
Admiral Kamath about this..

02:14:59.792 --> 02:15:03.000
...and I am convinced that
he's with Vikram on this deal.

02:15:03.083 --> 02:15:06.208
In fact, they offered
me one million as bribe.

02:15:06.292 --> 02:15:07.625
Just to toe the line.

02:15:08.500 --> 02:15:10.292
One million?
- Yes.

02:15:11.167 --> 02:15:14.458
And so I thought I should
tell you about this directly.

02:15:16.667 --> 02:15:18.042
That Vikram..

02:15:19.042 --> 02:15:20.292
...is a fool.

02:15:22.250 --> 02:15:25.292
I mean he should realize
that this game is worth millions.

02:15:25.792 --> 02:15:28.417
He should've offered
you two million.

02:15:30.792 --> 02:15:34.000
But don't worry,
I will talk to him.

02:15:34.917 --> 02:15:38.208
I'll get you two million,
rest assured.

02:15:44.292 --> 02:15:48.000
And when I didn't agree,
they got me transferred overnight.

02:15:48.875 --> 02:15:51.625
And before I could
take any action..

02:15:51.958 --> 02:15:54.667
...they posted me on
INS Mysore the next day..

02:15:55.000 --> 02:15:56.667
...which was leaving for 6 months.

02:16:16.583 --> 02:16:20.000
When I returned, I found
out about Vikram and Cynthia.

02:16:21.542 --> 02:16:23.875
And that was my failure, Mr. Lobo.

02:16:25.458 --> 02:16:29.292
The man who claims to protect the
nation, couldn't protect his home.

02:16:30.625 --> 02:16:32.708
It isn't Cynthia's fault.

02:16:34.666 --> 02:16:36.125
On one hand,
it was my personal life..

02:16:36.208 --> 02:16:38.541
...and on the other,
the aircraft carrier scam.

02:16:39.958 --> 02:16:41.708
That is the reason..

02:16:42.833 --> 02:16:44.208
...I planned everything.

02:16:45.083 --> 02:16:45.791
Sir, l..

02:16:45.875 --> 02:16:48.166
Rustom listen.
I know why you called.

02:16:48.583 --> 02:16:52.500
I'll tell Vikram to meet
you and sort out this matter.

02:16:52.750 --> 02:16:56.208
I am going to meet him,
and I won't spare him either.

02:16:58.083 --> 02:16:59.208
One more thing.

02:17:00.291 --> 02:17:03.625
I have copies of the London
Aircraft Carrier's reports..

02:17:04.166 --> 02:17:07.166
...which will prove how
badly rusted the carrier is.

02:17:08.333 --> 02:17:10.791
And how big a loss
it is for our country.

02:17:12.083 --> 02:17:13.125
Let's see..

02:17:14.500 --> 02:17:16.041
...how you guys escape this.

02:17:16.125 --> 02:17:18.166
Rustom, don't be foolish.

02:17:18.541 --> 02:17:20.041
I'll bloody expose you all.

02:17:20.125 --> 02:17:21.583
I've told you before..

02:17:22.958 --> 02:17:26.500
...I didn't know that
my call would be recorded.

02:17:27.125 --> 02:17:31.666
And Bakshi would play half the recording
in court and use it against me.

02:17:33.250 --> 02:17:34.875
When I went into Vikram's room..

02:17:55.666 --> 02:17:57.125
What's the matter, Commander sir?

02:17:57.500 --> 02:17:59.041
So early in the morning?

02:18:00.458 --> 02:18:02.625
I guess your wife..

02:18:37.125 --> 02:18:40.583
So why didn't you expose
Bakshi in the court?

02:18:41.666 --> 02:18:44.750
Civilians shouldn't lose
faith in the Navy, Lobo sir.

02:18:46.625 --> 02:18:49.750
And I don't want the
Navy to get a bad name..

02:18:50.500 --> 02:18:52.833
...because of a few
corrupt officers..

02:18:54.041 --> 02:18:55.916
...and compromise the
security of our country.

02:18:57.291 --> 02:18:59.708
That's why you made
a copy of all the documents.

02:18:59.791 --> 02:19:02.250
I don't have any
copy of the documents.

02:19:04.125 --> 02:19:05.666
It was a bluff.

02:19:07.208 --> 02:19:10.125
My only motive is
to stop that rusty ship..

02:19:10.208 --> 02:19:13.166
...from coming to
our country at any cost.

02:19:14.250 --> 02:19:17.000
The Indian Navy will definitely
get an aircraft carrier..

02:19:17.500 --> 02:19:21.291
...but only after making the necessary
changes that I've recommended.

02:19:27.375 --> 02:19:30.458
Commander sir, what if the
jury holds you guilty tomorrow?

02:19:33.500 --> 02:19:34.708
<i>No, Mr. Lobe.</i>

02:19:36.333 --> 02:19:37.750
I will walk tomorrow.

02:19:40.541 --> 02:19:42.916
This jury will support me tomorrow.

02:19:43.583 --> 02:19:45.333
How can you be so sure?

02:19:46.708 --> 02:19:48.667
You're sitting here with me,
Mr. Lobo.

02:19:49.708 --> 02:19:52.125
You.. the jury..

02:19:53.292 --> 02:19:55.083
...and the public outside.

02:19:55.917 --> 02:19:59.375
Everybody knows that I'm wrong,
but also agree..

02:19:59.708 --> 02:20:01.583
...that I shouldn't be punished.

02:20:02.875 --> 02:20:04.625
Vikram deserved to die.

02:20:05.042 --> 02:20:07.042
And I don't deserve to be punished.

02:20:09.375 --> 02:20:13.292
Rustom! Rustom!

02:20:26.292 --> 02:20:27.708
Of course, guilty.

02:20:28.250 --> 02:20:29.667
Is that the final verdict?

02:20:29.958 --> 02:20:31.250
Yes.
- Yes.

02:20:31.583 --> 02:20:33.625
Ok, let us inform the court.

02:21:01.167 --> 02:21:04.125
Rustom, not guilty!

02:21:31.917 --> 02:21:34.250
Does the jury's decision
have a majority?

02:21:34.583 --> 02:21:35.625
Yes.

02:22:26.417 --> 02:22:29.042
The jury has found,
by a vote of 8:1..

02:22:29.125 --> 02:22:33.542
...that Commander Rustom Pavri,
alleged murderer of Vikram Makhija..

02:22:47.042 --> 02:22:48.292
...is not guilty.

02:23:14.792 --> 02:23:16.583
Rustom is not guilty.

02:23:25.417 --> 02:23:28.167
Let him go! Move back!
- Thank you.

02:23:28.250 --> 02:23:31.875
Move back! Wait! Congratulations, sir!
- Thank you.

02:23:31.958 --> 02:23:34.750
Saw how my newspaper worked magic?

02:23:38.750 --> 02:23:40.208
Preeti, don't worry.

02:23:40.792 --> 02:23:42.333
We'll appeal to the High Court.

02:23:43.208 --> 02:23:46.667
Definitely, but I don't need you.

02:24:24.250 --> 02:24:25.333
Rustom.

02:24:28.250 --> 02:24:30.125
Can you ever forgive me?

02:24:31.375 --> 02:24:34.958
"I won't be able
to live without you."

02:24:35.042 --> 02:24:41.292
"Truly, I'll wither away,
that's for sure."

02:24:42.125 --> 02:24:45.000
"That's for sure."

02:24:46.333 --> 02:24:49.667
"My laughter and tears
are because of you."

02:24:50.125 --> 02:24:56.250
"My existence is because of you,
that's for sure."

02:24:56.958 --> 02:24:59.792
"That's for sure."

02:25:00.833 --> 02:25:08.417
"You are in every breath,
every time, that's for sure."

02:25:08.500 --> 02:25:15.792
"Whether you're pain or pleasure,
you're mine for sure."

02:25:15.875 --> 02:25:23.417
"You are in every breath,
every time, that's for sure."

02:25:23.500 --> 02:25:31.750
"Whether you're pain or pleasure,
you're mine for sure."

02:25:38.708 --> 02:25:42.042
"I won't be able
to live without you."

02:25:42.333 --> 02:25:48.792
"Truly, I'll wither away,
that's for sure."

02:25:49.333 --> 02:25:51.917
"That's for sure."
