01:06.713 --> 01:09.581
- SHIT! YOU SCARED ME.
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

01:09.583 --> 01:12.617
I JUST THOUGHT I'D DO THE HONORS
OF UNBOXING IT AND SETTING IT UP,

01:12.619 --> 01:14.786
GET SOME HANDS-ON EXPERIENCE
BEFORE THE GUYS GOT HERE.

01:14.788 --> 01:16.855
- WHAT MEMORY CARD ARE YOU USING?
- IT'S BLANK. I CHECKED.

01:16.857 --> 01:19.257
- DID YOU CHANGE THE DEFAULT SETTINGS?
- RELAX, BABE.

01:19.259 --> 01:20.993
I'M NOT GONNA FUCK UP
YOUR CAMERA.

01:20.995 --> 01:22.661
I'M SORRY.

01:22.663 --> 01:24.529
I'M JUST A LITTLE NERVOUS.

01:24.531 --> 01:26.798
IF ANYTHING HAPPENS TO THIS
STUFF AND I CAN'T RETURN IT,

01:26.800 --> 01:28.299
I WILL BE HOMELESS.

01:28.301 --> 01:29.768
YOU KNOW
THERE'S A SOLUTION TO THAT.

01:29.770 --> 01:31.437
YOU COULD GET AN ACTUAL JOB.

01:31.439 --> 01:34.006
THIS IS MY JOB.

01:34.008 --> 01:36.008
I HAVE TO BE COMPLETELY FOCUSED
ON MY CAREER.

01:36.010 --> 01:37.743
WHY DO YOU THINK
I SPEND SO MUCH TIME

01:37.745 --> 01:39.544
TRYING TO FIND THE RIGHT
FOLLOW-UP PROJECT?

01:39.546 --> 01:41.513
FOLLOW-UP PROJECT?

01:41.515 --> 01:43.516
WHEN DID YOU BECOME
SO PRETENTIOUS?

01:43.518 --> 01:45.651
"NO TURNING BACK" WAS GOOD,

01:45.653 --> 01:48.754
BUT IT HAD
A VERY NICHE AUDIENCE.

01:48.756 --> 01:52.725
I WANNA MAKE A FILM WITH A MORE
WIDESPREAD COMMERCIAL APPEAL.

01:52.727 --> 01:56.362
MMM, YOU THINK THIS IS THE ONE
TO BET THE FARM ON?

01:56.364 --> 01:58.632
I'VE BEEN DEVELOPING THIS IDEA
FOR MONTHS,

01:58.634 --> 02:01.634
AND EVERY BIG FILM FESTIVAL
DEADLINE IS RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER.

02:01.636 --> 02:04.270
IT'S NOW OR NEVER.
OTHERWISE I'LL BE WASHING DISHES

02:04.272 --> 02:05.973
AT DENNY'S
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.

02:05.975 --> 02:08.608
YOU'VE NO IDEA HOW
MUCH I WOULD PAY TO SEE THAT.

02:08.610 --> 02:10.776
I JUST REFUSE TO COMPROMISE.

02:10.779 --> 02:12.946
DOES THAT ALSO APPLY
TO YOUR WARDROBE?

02:12.948 --> 02:16.650
'CAUSE I FEEL LIKE...
THOSE FUCKING SHOES.

02:16.652 --> 02:19.687
I MEAN, AT LEAST GET, LIKE,
A NEW SHIRT OR SOMETHING.

02:19.689 --> 02:21.923
IT COULD HELP
YOUR APPROACHABILITY.

02:21.925 --> 02:23.623
WELL, THAT'S WHY I HAVE YOU.

02:23.625 --> 02:25.826
HMM, AND TO THINK I WAS HERE
FOR MY TALENT.

02:25.828 --> 02:28.395
LOOK, YOU'RE GOING TO DO GREAT.

02:28.397 --> 02:29.931
THIS FILM IS GOING TO EXPLODE.

02:29.933 --> 02:32.734
EVERYTHING IS GONNA WORK OUT.

02:32.736 --> 02:35.069
TRUST ME.

02:35.071 --> 02:36.704
JUST REMEMBER TO HIT RECORD
NEXT TIME.

02:36.706 --> 02:37.874
WHAT?

02:46.783 --> 02:48.750
WHATCHA DOING THERE?

02:48.752 --> 02:51.919
JUST SETTING UP THE GOPRO TO GET
SOME GOOD TRANSITIONAL SHOTS.

02:51.921 --> 02:54.890
FUCKING MORONS.

02:54.892 --> 02:57.391
GUYS WEREN'T THINKING ABOUT
LEAVING WITHOUT US, WERE YA?

02:57.393 --> 03:00.062
YOU WEREN'T THINKING
ABOUT BEING ON TIME FOR ONCE, WERE YOU?

03:00.064 --> 03:01.730
HAD TO GRAB THE GOODS?

03:01.732 --> 03:03.698
HEY, MAN, THANKS FOR JUMPING
ON BOARD AGAIN

03:03.700 --> 03:06.702
AND AGREEING TO BE PART OF THIS.
IT REALLY MEANS A LOT.

03:06.704 --> 03:08.037
WHATEVER I CAN DO TO HELP.

03:08.039 --> 03:09.938
DID YOU GET THE MICS?

03:09.940 --> 03:11.640
YEAH, I GOT THE MICS.

03:11.642 --> 03:14.810
AWW, LOOK AT
YOU GUYS GETTING ALONG.

03:14.812 --> 03:17.411
IT'S A LITTLE MORE COMPLICATED
THAN POINT AND CLICK, ISN'T IT?

03:17.413 --> 03:18.915
NO, IT'S JUST LIKE PHOTOGRAPHY.

03:18.917 --> 03:20.850
I'M JUST TAKING 24 PICTURES
A SECOND.

03:20.852 --> 03:22.551
WOULD YOU MIND TURNING IT OFF
JUST FOR A MINUTE?

03:22.553 --> 03:25.554
- WHY?
- HEY, PUT THIS ON.

03:25.556 --> 03:27.790
- WHAT'S THE CATCH?
- THREE BUCKS A PUFF.

03:27.792 --> 03:29.691
DUDE, I'M NOT SPENDING
THREE BUCKS FOR THAT.

03:29.693 --> 03:31.461
COME ON, MAN.
JUST PUT IT ON FOR THE FUN.

03:31.463 --> 03:33.429
- IT'S FREE.
- PRODUCT PLACEMENT.

03:33.431 --> 03:35.131
- SO CLEVER.
- YEAH.

03:35.133 --> 03:36.666
- YOU GUYS READY?
- YEAH.

03:36.668 --> 03:39.702
HERE. PUT THAT ON.

03:39.704 --> 03:41.704
WHAT THE FUCK
DID YOU DO TO YOUR FOOT?

03:41.706 --> 03:43.439
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

03:43.441 --> 03:45.912
- GOT THE SHOT.
- DUMBASS.

03:52.684 --> 03:55.686
AS YOU CAN SEE TO OUR
LEFT, WE HAVE THE OZARK MOUNTAINS,

03:55.688 --> 03:58.622
KNOWN FOR THEIR RUGGED BEAUTY,

03:58.624 --> 04:03.160
MANY UNBLEMISHED CAVERNS,
AND A NEVERENDING SUPPLY OF METH HEADS.

04:03.162 --> 04:06.630
SPECIES INDIGENOUS
TO THESE PARTS INCLUDE MARK,

04:06.632 --> 04:08.666
OUR FEARLESS LEADER.

04:08.668 --> 04:12.036
AND IF YOU LOOK VERY CLOSELY YOU
CAN SEE TWO BUDDING FILMMAKERS

04:12.038 --> 04:13.737
IN THEIR NATURAL HABITAT.

04:13.739 --> 04:16.507
HERE WE HAVE ACE,
OUR LEAD CAMERAMAN,

04:16.509 --> 04:18.142
AKA THE HUNTER OF THE PACK.

04:18.144 --> 04:22.446
AND OVER HERE WE HAVE RYAN,
THE OMEGA OF THE PACK,

04:22.448 --> 04:26.483
WHOSE RESPONSIBILITIES
INCLUDE PROTECTING, SCOUTING,

04:26.485 --> 04:30.488
AND OF COURSE, SEEING
TO THE NEEDS OF THE ALPHA.

04:30.490 --> 04:32.157
WHY DO I HAVE TO BE THE ONE
WHO SEES TO THE NEEDS?

04:32.159 --> 04:34.025
WHY CAN'T IT BE ACE?

04:34.027 --> 04:36.795
'CAUSE I'M THE ONLY ONE
WHO HASN'T SLEPT WITH HER.

04:36.797 --> 04:38.663
WHAT?

04:38.665 --> 04:40.899
'CAUSE I'M THE ONLY ONE
WHO HASN'T SLEPT WITH HER.

04:40.901 --> 04:43.435
I MEAN, YOU GUYS
USED TO DATE, RIGHT?

04:43.437 --> 04:46.471
SERIOUSLY, WAY TO MAKE ME FEEL
LIKE A WHORE.

04:46.473 --> 04:48.740
FOURTH WALL. HELLO?

04:48.742 --> 04:50.809
OH NO, BY ALL MEANS,
BURN THROUGH ALL THE MEDIA

04:50.811 --> 04:52.611
BEFORE WE EVEN GET THERE.

04:52.613 --> 04:54.981
YOU GONNA BE A LITTLE BITCH
LIKE THIS THE WHOLE TIME, RYAN?

04:54.983 --> 04:56.983
OH, SHIT.

04:56.985 --> 04:59.919
DON'T WORRY, RYAN,
LESLIE'S GOT THE RIGHT IDEA.

04:59.921 --> 05:02.554
WE NEED TO KEEP SHOOTING.
WE NEVER KNOW WHAT WE'RE GONNA CATCH.

05:02.556 --> 05:04.156
EASY FOR YOU TO SAY.
YOU'RE NOT THE ONE

05:04.158 --> 05:06.159
THAT HAS TO SIFT THROUGH HOURS
OF USELESS FOOTAGE.

05:06.161 --> 05:08.028
DUDE, WE'RE ABOUT TO GO SHOOT

05:08.030 --> 05:10.130
THE DEVIL IN A FUCKING
WAREHOUSE.

05:10.132 --> 05:12.598
DOCUMENTING OUR FAILURE IS
THE ONLY THING WE GOT.

05:12.600 --> 05:14.634
SO NEITHER ONE OF YOU BELIEVE
IN ANY OF THIS.

05:14.636 --> 05:17.570
I CHOOSE TO REMAIN UNAFFILIATED.

05:17.572 --> 05:19.673
IT'S ALWAYS
THE, UH, NONBELIEVERS

05:19.675 --> 05:22.075
WHO END UP IN THE FETAL
POSITION FIRST.

05:22.077 --> 05:24.011
OKAY.

05:24.013 --> 05:26.512
WE HAVE A BETTER CHANCE
AT FINDING BIGFOOT.

05:29.985 --> 05:32.719
HEY, GUYS, ARE YOU GONNA BE
WANTING THIS ALL ON ONE CHECK?

05:32.721 --> 05:34.988
- SEPARATE, PLEASE.
- OKAY.

05:34.990 --> 05:38.191
I GUESS DAYS OF MEAL, CREDIT,
AND COPY ARE OVER.

05:38.193 --> 05:39.995
HERE'S THE MANTRA
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO RECITE.

05:43.133 --> 05:47.001
"DARK FORCES BOTH BLACK
AND WHITE REACHING OUT..."

05:47.003 --> 05:50.238
WE'RE ACTUALLY
SUPPOSED TO READ THIS OUT LOUD?

05:50.240 --> 05:52.773
YEAH. I MEAN, ONE OF US HAS TO.

05:52.775 --> 05:55.043
GREAT.
SO ONE OF US HAS TO SUMMON THE DEVIL.

05:55.045 --> 05:57.011
ANY TAKERS?

05:57.013 --> 05:59.147
- YOU GOT IT, MAN.
- NO, NO, MAN. IT SHOULD BE YOU.

05:59.149 --> 06:00.615
YOU'RE THE MOST PRAGMATIC
ONE HERE.

06:00.617 --> 06:02.283
SO, ALL THREE OF YOU
ARE TOO SCARED TO DO IT?

06:02.285 --> 06:03.952
WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE
WE HAVE A VOLUNTEER.

06:03.954 --> 06:05.820
AH, NO.

06:05.822 --> 06:08.690
I WOULD PREFER TO RETAIN
OWNERSHIP OF MY SOUL.

06:08.692 --> 06:10.760
- RIGHT.
- HEY, ACE, GIVE ME YOUR KNIFE.

06:13.830 --> 06:15.565
THIS CAN'T BE GOOD.

06:23.841 --> 06:26.175
WE'RE LITERALLY GONNA DRAW
STRAWS FOR IT?

06:26.177 --> 06:27.909
YEAH.

06:27.911 --> 06:30.246
I MEAN, NONE OF US WANNA DO IT.
SO IT'S ONLY FAIR.

06:30.248 --> 06:31.682
ALL RIGHT.

06:34.118 --> 06:35.653
â™ª BOW CHICKA BOW WOW

06:42.660 --> 06:44.693
YEAH. THE CHOSEN ONE.

06:44.695 --> 06:46.695
OF COURSE I AM.

06:46.697 --> 06:48.233
SON OF A BITCH!

06:57.609 --> 06:59.275
UH, SIR, EXCUSE ME.
NICE TO MEET YOU.

06:59.277 --> 07:00.777
- UH, MARK.
- JEFF.

07:00.779 --> 07:01.978
YES, WE'RE IN TOWN
ASKING PEOPLE AROUND

07:01.980 --> 07:03.913
ABOUT THE MILLBROOK FACTORY.

07:03.915 --> 07:06.183
- I THINK... IF I KNEW...
- WHAT BUTTONS DID YOU PRESS?

07:06.185 --> 07:07.884
- CAN YOU HEAR ME?
- YEAH. DON'T HIT IT.

07:07.886 --> 07:09.953
I'M SORRY. UM...

07:09.955 --> 07:12.822
WHAT COULD YOU TELL US
ABOUT THE HISTORY OF THE WAREHOUSE?

07:12.824 --> 07:15.191
UM, NOT MUCH.
I KNOW WHERE IT'S AT.

07:15.193 --> 07:19.163
IT OPENED IN THE WINTER OF '74

07:19.165 --> 07:22.299
AND SHUT DOWN IN THE FALL
OF '79.

07:22.301 --> 07:25.236
I KNOW IT'S BEEN AROUND
FOR QUITE SOME TIME,

07:25.238 --> 07:27.238
BUT IT'S... IT'S BEEN ABANDONED
FOR A WHILE.

07:27.240 --> 07:29.240
I KNOW IT WAS SOME TYPE
OF DISTRIBUTION CENTER

07:29.242 --> 07:31.243
- OKAY.
- AND I DON'T KNOW WHY IT SHUT DOWN.

07:31.245 --> 07:34.279
I ASSUME... I ASSUME THEY DISTRIBUTED
THEIR JOBS SOMEPLACE ELSE.

07:34.281 --> 07:35.813
- YEAH.
- SEEMS TO BE THE AMERICAN WAY.

07:35.815 --> 07:37.882
IT WAS A VICTIM
OF CORPORATE BUYOUT.

07:37.884 --> 07:41.887
YEAR AFTER YEAR, BIG COMPANIES
BUYING UP PROFITABLE SMALL COMPANIES

07:41.889 --> 07:44.755
TO TAKE OVER THEIR...
THEIR BUSINESS,

07:44.757 --> 07:47.792
AND, UNFORTUNATELY,
HARRISON KINDA LOST IN THAT.

07:47.794 --> 07:52.096
HAVE YOU HEARD OF ANY RUMORS
OF, UH...

07:52.098 --> 07:53.765
SAY, PARANORMAL ACTIVITY,

07:53.767 --> 07:56.368
- OR SUPE...
- UH, SUPERNATURAL.

07:56.370 --> 07:57.702
- SUPER...
- JUST ASK IT AGAIN.

07:57.704 --> 07:59.271
UM...

07:59.273 --> 08:02.207
SATANIC PEOPLE GO OVER THERE
TO THAT LAND AND WORSHIP,

08:02.209 --> 08:05.978
AND THEN, UH, THEY CAME IN AND
BUILT THE FACTORY ON TOP OF IT.

08:05.980 --> 08:07.980
SO, THE RUMOR,
LEGEND OR WHATEVER

08:07.982 --> 08:09.948
IS THAT IT'S...
IT'S, YOU KNOW, CURSED.

08:09.950 --> 08:11.850
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT THAT.

08:11.852 --> 08:16.154
I KNOW THAT, UH, WHEN YOU'RE OUT
THERE BY YOURSELF OR AT NIGHT

08:16.156 --> 08:18.124
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT,
THERE'S A LOT OF SOUNDS.

08:18.126 --> 08:21.894
A LOT OF... IT'S KIND OF AN EERIE
PLACE TO BE AT IN THE DARK.

08:21.896 --> 08:23.896
SPOOKY PLACE.

08:23.898 --> 08:27.266
SO... SO, YOU'VE...
YOU'VE BEEN IN THERE.

08:27.268 --> 08:28.667
BEEN IN THERE, YEAH.

08:28.669 --> 08:31.671
THERE WAS STUFF SPRAYED
ON THE WALL,

08:31.673 --> 08:33.373
AND IF YOU GO DOWN TO
THE TUNNEL UNDERNEATH IT,

08:33.375 --> 08:35.674
THERE'S SOME... THAT'S HOW
YOU GOTTA GET IN, YOU KNOW.

08:35.677 --> 08:38.010
I DON'T KNOW OF ANY DEATHS
ON THE PROPERTY.

08:38.011 --> 08:40.446
UM, THERE'VE BEEN A LOT
OF INJURIES OVER THE YEARS.

08:40.448 --> 08:45.352
MY DADDY HAD A FRIEND WHO...
WHO PASSED AWAY, ACTUALLY,

08:45.354 --> 08:47.354
AT THE... AT THE WAREHOUSE.

08:47.356 --> 08:49.389
- OH, REALLY?
- KINDA WEIRD, TOO.

08:49.391 --> 08:52.192
HE WAS FEELING SICK AND WENT TO
THE BATHROOM AND NEVER CAME BACK.

08:52.194 --> 08:54.329
I'VE ACTUALLY ONLY HEARD
ONE STORY ABOUT IT.

08:54.331 --> 08:56.864
- OH, REALLY?
- YOUNG GENTLEMAN, THAT'S A FRIEND OF MINE,

08:56.866 --> 08:58.866
WHOSE MOM WORKED THERE
SAID SOME...

08:58.868 --> 09:01.301
- SHE WOULD HEAR HER NAME BEING CALLED.
- OKAY.

09:01.303 --> 09:03.804
DOES THE DATE OCTOBER
6TH MEAN ANYTHING TO YOU?

09:03.806 --> 09:05.005
NOT TO MY KNOWLEDGE.

09:05.007 --> 09:06.341
CAN YOU TELL US
IF THE DATE OCTOBER 6TH

09:06.343 --> 09:08.243
MEANS ANYTHING TO YOU?

09:08.245 --> 09:10.278
DID IT SHUT DOWN ON THE SIXTH?
IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING?

09:10.280 --> 09:13.448
OCTOBER 6TH,
DOES THAT MEAN ANYTHING TO YOU?

09:13.450 --> 09:16.316
OTHER THAN BEING TOMORROW,
IT DOESN'T MEAN MUCH TO ME.

09:16.318 --> 09:19.120
THAT'S MY WIFE AND MINE'S
ANNIVERSARY, YEAH.

09:19.122 --> 09:21.122
YOU SHOULD TALK
TO PASTOR YOUNGBLOOD.

09:21.124 --> 09:22.957
HE'S BEEN AROUND HERE
FOR GENERATIONS.

09:22.959 --> 09:24.791
HE'S VERY POPULAR.

09:24.793 --> 09:26.727
HE'S AT SECOND BAPTIST CHURCH,
JUST OUTSIDE OF TOWN.

09:26.729 --> 09:27.962
HE'S THE ONE THAT MARRIED ME
AND MY WIFE.

09:27.964 --> 09:29.966
MIGHT WANNA STAY AWAY
FROM THERE.

09:32.869 --> 09:33.968
YEAH, I'LL KEEP THAT IN MIND.

09:33.970 --> 09:35.872
- THANK YOU.
- THANK YOU.

09:52.423 --> 09:55.124
BROTHERS, THERE ARE EVILS

09:55.126 --> 09:57.126
JUST BEYOND THOSE DOORS,

09:57.128 --> 09:59.995
AND THEY WILL TRY
TO PERSUADE YOU,

09:59.997 --> 10:03.999
SEDUCE YOU, MANIPULATE YOU
INTO DOING THEIR BIDDING,

10:04.001 --> 10:07.870
BUT I URGE YOU TO HOLD FAST.

10:07.872 --> 10:10.207
EVEN THE PRINCE OF THE POWER
OF THE AIR

10:10.209 --> 10:14.111
SHALL STAND BEFORE THE ALMIGHTY
AND HAVE HIS DAY OF JUDGMENT.

10:23.088 --> 10:27.090
BUT MAN ALONE CANNOT
OVERCOME TEMPTATION.

10:27.092 --> 10:29.259
NO.

10:29.261 --> 10:33.129
NO, ONLY WITH HIS WORD
IN YOUR HEART

10:33.131 --> 10:35.832
CAN YOU BREAK FREE FROM
THE CHAINS OF IMPURITY

10:35.834 --> 10:40.337
THAT WILL SURELY LEAD YOU DOWN
THE PATH TO ETERNAL DAMNATION.

10:40.339 --> 10:42.106
OH SHIT!

10:42.108 --> 10:45.910
YOU KNOW WHAT I SPEAK OF,
BROTHERS?

10:45.912 --> 10:47.511
I KNOW YOU HEAR THE WORD.

10:47.513 --> 10:48.814
HI.

10:50.916 --> 10:52.250
HELLO.

10:52.252 --> 10:53.585
ME AND MY FRIENDS
ARE MAKING A FILM

10:53.587 --> 10:55.119
ABOUT THE HISTORY OF HARRISON,

10:55.121 --> 10:56.921
AND WOULD LOVE TO GET
A FORMAL INTERVIEW

10:56.923 --> 10:59.924
WITH A MEMBER OF ONE
OF ITS MOST PROMINENT FAMILIES.

10:59.926 --> 11:01.926
CERTAINLY. I'LL JUST FINISH
TENDING TO MY FLOCK

11:01.928 --> 11:03.594
AND THEN WE CAN STEP INSIDE.

11:03.596 --> 11:05.597
- OH, IN THE CHURCH?
- YES.

11:05.599 --> 11:07.599
I LIVE RIGHT DOWNSTAIRS.

11:07.601 --> 11:09.503
ALL RIGHT.
THANK YOU.

11:24.318 --> 11:26.220
COOL.

11:27.354 --> 11:30.258
OOH, I LOVE THIS SHOW.

11:41.970 --> 11:44.137
MY APOLOGIES.

11:44.139 --> 11:46.539
I WASN'T EXPECTING COMPANY
AT THIS LATE HOUR.

11:46.541 --> 11:48.508
WELL, WE'RE ALMOST
FINISHED SETTING UP THE SHOT,

11:48.510 --> 11:49.908
SO IF YOU JUST WANNA
TAKE A SEAT,

11:49.910 --> 11:51.313
WE'LL GO AHEAD AND GET STARTED.

11:58.119 --> 12:00.286
ALL GOOD.

12:00.288 --> 12:01.587
ALL SET?

12:01.589 --> 12:02.989
READY WHEN YOU ARE.

12:02.991 --> 12:05.024
OKAY, I'M ROLLING.

12:05.026 --> 12:06.393
I UNDERSTAND YOUR FAMILY

12:06.395 --> 12:07.628
USED TO OWN
ALL THE LAND IN THIS AREA.

12:07.630 --> 12:09.630
IS THAT CORRECT?

12:09.632 --> 12:12.333
YES, THAT IS CORRECT.

12:12.335 --> 12:15.369
MY GREAT GRANDFATHER'S FAMILY
MOVED HERE AFTER THE CIVIL WAR.

12:15.371 --> 12:20.240
HIS FATHER DIED WHILE FIGHTING
WITH BRAGG'S ARMY OF TENNESSEE.

12:20.242 --> 12:22.576
THEY MOVED HERE SHORTLY AFTER

12:22.578 --> 12:25.579
AND SET THE FOUNDATION FOR
THE HARRISON WE ALL KNOW TODAY.

12:25.581 --> 12:28.582
YOU SEEM TO BE
QUITE THE HISTORY BUFF.

12:28.584 --> 12:32.587
MY FAMILY HAS ALWAYS KEPT
EXTENSIVE RECORDS

12:32.589 --> 12:35.523
OF OUR HISTORY IN HOPES
OF PRESERVING OUR HERITAGE.

12:35.525 --> 12:38.560
I TAKE IT YOU'VE
LIVED HERE YOUR ENTIRE LIFE.

12:38.562 --> 12:40.595
BORN AND RAISED.

12:40.597 --> 12:44.466
WHICH MEANS YOU WERE HERE
WHEN THE PLANT OPENED IN 1974.

12:44.468 --> 12:48.403
YES. I WAS VERY YOUNG.

12:48.405 --> 12:52.440
SO, WHEN THE PLANT
WAS CLOSED BACK IN 1979,

12:52.442 --> 12:56.010
A LOT OF PEOPLE HAD,
UH, SUSPICIONS

12:56.012 --> 12:58.681
THAT MYSTERIOUS THINGS
WERE HAPPENING

12:58.683 --> 13:03.685
AS A RESULT OF RITUALS CONDUCTED
HERE ON THE LAND YEARS AGO.

13:03.687 --> 13:07.390
LIVING SO CLOSE,
DID YOU EVER EXPERIENCE

13:07.392 --> 13:11.362
OR SEE ANYTHING
THAT WAS UNUSUAL?

13:13.498 --> 13:16.399
NOTHING PARTICULARLY NOTEWORTHY.

13:16.401 --> 13:19.268
NO STRANGE ACTIVITY

13:19.270 --> 13:22.706
OR UNEXPLAINED PHENOMENON?

13:22.708 --> 13:26.177
MY CHILDHOOD WAS
VERY UNEVENTFUL.

13:27.578 --> 13:29.413
WHAT ABOUT YOUR PARENTS?

13:29.415 --> 13:31.581
DID THEY EVER TELL
YOU ABOUT ANYTHING

13:31.583 --> 13:33.652
OUT OF THE ORDINARY
THEY EVER SAW?

13:35.587 --> 13:38.588
YES, THEY DID.

13:38.590 --> 13:41.023
ONE YEAR AT THE COUNTY FAIR,

13:41.025 --> 13:44.161
BILL DORSEY HAD A DOG
THAT COULD PLAY PIANO.

13:46.198 --> 13:49.999
ALL RIGHT, DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THE
LEGENDS SURROUNDING MILLBROOK?

13:50.001 --> 13:51.334
EXCUSE ME?

13:51.336 --> 13:52.769
THERE'S AN OLD LEGEND

13:52.771 --> 13:54.705
THAT IF YOU GO INSIDE
THE FACILITY AT MIDNIGHT

13:54.707 --> 13:57.742
ON THE SIXTH OF OCTOBER,
PERFORM A CERTAIN RITUAL,

13:57.744 --> 13:59.744
YOU CAN ASK
FOR WHATEVER YOU WANT

13:59.746 --> 14:02.747
AS LONG AS YOU'RE WILLING
TO PAY THE PRICE.

14:02.749 --> 14:06.717
SURELY YOU MUST KNOW
SOMETHING ABOUT IT.

14:06.719 --> 14:08.719
IN TIMES OF FEAR
AND UNCERTAINTY,

14:08.721 --> 14:12.690
PEOPLE TEND TO COOK UP ALL SORTS
OF IMAGINATIVE NOTIONS

14:12.692 --> 14:15.225
AS A COPING MECHANISM.

14:15.227 --> 14:18.396
SO YOU'RE SAYING
NONE OF IT IS REAL?

14:18.398 --> 14:21.767
I'M SIMPLY SAYING THAT THINGS
CAN BE BLOWN OUT OF PROPORTION.

14:21.769 --> 14:24.671
OKAY,
SO YOU HAVE AT LEAST HEARD OF IT.

14:29.677 --> 14:33.110
THERE WAS A COUPLE
AT THE TURN OF THE CENTURY,

14:33.112 --> 14:37.716
A HUSBAND AND WIFE
AND THEIR THREE CHILDREN.

14:37.718 --> 14:40.586
THE WIFE BECAME VERY ILL.

14:40.588 --> 14:44.289
HER CHANCES OF RECOVERY GREW
SLIMMER AND SLIMMER.

14:44.291 --> 14:48.627
HER HUSBAND EXHAUSTED
EVERY AVAILABLE OPTION

14:48.629 --> 14:51.330
BEFORE RESORTING
TO THE PRACTICES

14:51.332 --> 14:54.334
OF THOSE OF WHOM YOU SPEAK.

14:54.336 --> 14:57.504
HE PARTICIPATED IN THE RITUAL

14:57.506 --> 15:00.506
AND WAS GUARANTEED
HER FULL RECOVERY,

15:00.508 --> 15:04.510
BUT IN EXCHANGE HE HAD
TO SURRENDER THE SOULS

15:04.512 --> 15:06.613
OF HIS THREE CHILDREN.

15:06.615 --> 15:10.617
THEY WERE FOUND
BOUND IN STOCKS,

15:10.619 --> 15:13.522
HAVING BEEN AXED IN THE HEAD
UNTIL DEATH.

15:16.691 --> 15:19.225
HOW DO YOU KNOW ALL THIS?

15:19.227 --> 15:21.127
LIKE I SAID,

15:21.129 --> 15:25.131
MY FAMILY HAS KEPT VERY
EXTENSIVE RECORDS OF OUR HISTORY.

15:25.133 --> 15:28.134
SO THESE ARE YOUR RELATIVES
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT?

15:28.136 --> 15:31.138
DISTANT RELATIVES, YES.

15:31.140 --> 15:33.139
I'M NOT SURE OF THE LINEAGE,

15:33.141 --> 15:36.544
BUT THEY ARE BURIED
IN OUR OLD FAMILY CEMETERY

15:36.546 --> 15:39.279
RIGHT HERE
ON THE CHURCH GROUNDS.

15:39.281 --> 15:40.781
THAT'S GREAT!

15:40.783 --> 15:42.784
IS THERE ANY WAY WE COULD GET
A HOLD OF THOSE RECORDS

15:42.786 --> 15:44.687
FOR OUR FILM?

15:52.895 --> 15:55.799
WOULD YOU EXCUSE ME
FOR A MOMENT?

16:06.276 --> 16:09.277
STOP IT.

16:09.279 --> 16:12.280
HEY, SHH.

16:12.282 --> 16:15.282
YOU HEAR THAT?

16:21.325 --> 16:24.326
YOU CAN'T COME
OUT THERE. THEY CAN'T SEE YOU.

16:24.328 --> 16:27.329
NO ONE CAN SEE YOU.

16:27.331 --> 16:29.265
THEY SAW YOU IN THE CHURCH.
THEY DID NOT LIKE IT.

16:29.267 --> 16:30.766
THEY DID NOT KNOW
WHO YOU WERE.

16:30.768 --> 16:33.769
THEY DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT WE'VE DONE.

16:33.771 --> 16:36.304
THAT NEVER HAPPENED.

16:36.306 --> 16:41.344
THEY'RE ASKING ABOUT STUFF.

16:41.346 --> 16:42.447
WHAT THE FUCK?

17:04.469 --> 17:06.372
I'M READY TO CONTINUE.

17:17.348 --> 17:21.351
UM, I'M SORRY...

17:21.353 --> 17:22.722
WHAT ABOUT THE RECORDS?

17:24.356 --> 17:27.357
OH, THE RECORDS.

17:27.358 --> 17:30.263
I'M AFRAID THEY'RE PRIVATE.

17:32.999 --> 17:36.701
THERE'S NO WAY
WE CAN GET A QUICK LOOK?

17:36.703 --> 17:39.639
WOULD ANYONE LIKE SOMETHING
MORE TO DRINK?

17:48.015 --> 17:51.015
THAT IS A PRIME EXAMPLE
OF WHY I DON'T GO TO CHURCH.

17:51.017 --> 17:54.553
CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT GUY IS
ACTUALLY IN CHARGE OF THIS PLACE?

17:54.555 --> 17:56.287
CREEPED ME THE FUCK OUT.

17:56.289 --> 17:58.289
I WAS NOT ABOUT TO DRINK
THAT TEA.

17:58.291 --> 18:00.291
HE WAS FULL OF SHIT.
PLAYING IT UP FOR CAMERA.

18:00.293 --> 18:03.294
THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY
TO KNOW FOR SURE.

18:03.296 --> 18:05.965
- WHICH IS WHAT?
- THE CEMETERY.

18:05.967 --> 18:08.300
- WHAT ABOUT THE CEMETERY?
- WE HAVE TO FIND THE CEMETERY.

18:08.302 --> 18:10.736
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
IT EVEN EXISTS?

18:10.738 --> 18:12.805
WELL, IF WE CAN FIND IT, AT LEAST WE'LL
HAVE SOMETHING TO BACK UP HIS STORY WITH.

18:12.807 --> 18:14.673
HE WOULDN'T EVEN SHOW US
A FUCKING PHOTO ALBUM.

18:14.675 --> 18:16.408
I DOUBT HE'S GONNA GIVE US
A GRAND TOUR OF...

18:16.410 --> 18:17.844
WE DON'T NEED HIM.
WE CAN JUST COME BACK TOMORROW.

18:17.846 --> 18:19.478
- WE'LL FIND IT ON OUR OWN.
- NO, NO, NO, NO.

18:19.480 --> 18:21.413
- IT HAS TO BE NOW.
- WELL, IT'S PITCH BLACK OUTSIDE.

18:21.415 --> 18:23.282
OH, LET'S DO IT.
IT'LL LOOK SO CREEPY.

18:23.284 --> 18:24.717
COME ON, MAN.
FUCK, YEAH.

18:24.719 --> 18:26.719
- NO, THANK YOU?
- REALLY?

18:26.721 --> 18:28.387
- DUDE, TAKE A SHOT.
- WE'RE WORKING.

18:28.389 --> 18:30.523
- ONE OF US HAS TO KEEP...
- ALWAYS FUCKING WORKING.

18:30.525 --> 18:32.959
- TAKE IT.
- TURNED DOWN A... GUYS, THAT'S FIRST.

18:32.961 --> 18:35.328
- OH, LAME.
- ACE, HOW'S YOUR BATTERY LOOKING?

18:35.330 --> 18:36.996
- IT'S GOOD.
- TO BE CLEAR, MARK,

18:36.998 --> 18:38.998
I WASN'T SUGGESTING TRESPASSING.

18:39.000 --> 18:40.767
OKAY. NO, IF WE CAN MAKE IT
PAST THE CHURCH

18:40.769 --> 18:42.770
WITHOUT BEING SEEN,
WE SHOULD BE GOOD.

18:42.772 --> 18:44.637
ALL RIGHT, NOW,
FROM WHAT I CAN TELL,

18:44.639 --> 18:46.806
THE PLACE IS NOT FAR
FROM HERE AT ALL.

18:46.808 --> 18:49.609
WHAT, DID YOU HIT THE "FEELIN'
LUCKY" BUTTON ON GOOGLE MAPS?

18:49.611 --> 18:51.077
THERE'S A SMALL CLEARING
JUST THROUGH THE WOODS.

18:51.079 --> 18:53.414
THIS HAS TO BE IT.

18:53.416 --> 18:55.816
SO YOU'RE TELLING ME WE NEED
TO GO TRUDGING THROUGH THE WOODS

18:55.818 --> 18:57.551
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

18:57.553 --> 19:00.553
BASED ON THE WORD OF SOME
BATSHIT CRAZY PREACHER

19:00.555 --> 19:02.591
AND AN OUT-OF-DATE
RUSSIAN SATELLITE?

19:04.559 --> 19:06.462
COME ON.

19:17.674 --> 19:19.576
FUCKING HATE THE WOODS.

19:24.580 --> 19:27.483
FUCK! GOD, MARK!

19:52.709 --> 19:54.612
WHERE ARE WE FUCKING
GOING, MARK?

20:05.157 --> 20:08.158
OH, SHIT.
HEY, YOU GUYS.

20:08.160 --> 20:09.727
COME OVER HERE.

20:11.163 --> 20:13.064
I THINK I FOUND IT.

20:15.967 --> 20:18.969
IS THIS IT?

20:18.971 --> 20:20.971
CAN YOU GET IT?

20:20.973 --> 20:22.875
COME ON, MAN.

20:30.883 --> 20:33.917
THIS IS DEFINITELY IT, RIGHT?

20:33.919 --> 20:36.620
HOW OLD ARE
THESE FUCKING GRAVES?

20:36.622 --> 20:38.956
YEAH. LOOK HOW OLD THESE ARE.

20:38.958 --> 20:40.860
GET THE FUCK OUTTA HERE.

20:43.797 --> 20:46.797
1885.

20:46.799 --> 20:49.702
OH, FUCKING CREEPY.

21:01.882 --> 21:04.950
HEY, CHECK THIS OUT.

21:04.952 --> 21:06.952
WHY DON'T YOU CRAWL UP
IN THERE, RYAN?

21:06.954 --> 21:08.753
YEAH, FUCK THAT SHIT.

21:08.755 --> 21:11.658
HAS TO BE AROUND HERE SOMEWHERE.

21:18.199 --> 21:20.099
HEY, HEY, LESLIE,
COME CHECK THIS OUT.

21:20.101 --> 21:22.067
LOOK AT THIS.

21:22.069 --> 21:23.905
LOOK AT THIS.
1801.

21:28.142 --> 21:30.143
HEY, GUYS, LOOK AT THIS.

21:30.145 --> 21:32.011
ARE YOU GUYS SEEING THESE?

21:32.013 --> 21:33.447
WHAT THE FUCK?

21:35.583 --> 21:37.952
WHERE DO YOU THINK
THESE CAME FROM?

21:40.087 --> 21:42.655
WHAT THE FUCK IS ALL THIS STUFF?

21:42.657 --> 21:45.559
WHO DO YOU THINK PUT 'EM HERE?

21:56.838 --> 21:59.172
THESE THREE DON'T HAVE DATES
AND THEY'RE THE SMALLEST ONES,

21:59.174 --> 22:01.274
WHICH MEANS THEY'RE
PROBABLY CHILDREN.

22:01.276 --> 22:02.945
WHAT IF THESE ARE THE KIDS?

22:05.048 --> 22:08.684
OKAY,
I AM OFFICIALLY CREEPED OUT NOW.

22:10.819 --> 22:12.819
COOL. LOOK AT THAT.

22:12.821 --> 22:14.723
WHAT?

22:21.030 --> 22:23.264
- TURN OFF YOUR LIGHTS.
- FUCK!

22:23.266 --> 22:25.032
- ACE, TURN OFF YOUR LIGHTS!
- I CAN'T.

22:25.034 --> 22:27.034
SHIT!

22:32.176 --> 22:35.078
FUCK!

23:20.358 --> 23:22.260
FUCK!

23:25.363 --> 23:27.063
WE NEED TO GET BACK
TO THE RV NOW!

23:27.065 --> 23:28.967
- WHICH WAY IS IT?
- IT'S THIS WAY.

23:31.002 --> 23:32.904
COME ON.

23:35.640 --> 23:37.073
- HEY.
- WHAT?

23:37.075 --> 23:39.108
- I HAVE AN IDEA.
- NO. NO MORE IDEAS, MARK.

23:39.110 --> 23:41.111
- STOP.
- THE RECORDS.

23:41.113 --> 23:43.113
NO.

23:43.115 --> 23:45.115
ARE YOU OUT
OF YOUR FUCKING MIND?

23:45.117 --> 23:47.117
WE CAN'T BREAK INTO A CHURCH,
LET ALONE FILM IT.

23:47.119 --> 23:48.618
HE INVITED US IN, OKAY.

23:48.620 --> 23:50.320
SO, NO ONE HAS TO KNOW
WE WENT BACK.

23:50.322 --> 23:52.322
OH, DUDE, LET ME DO IT.

23:52.324 --> 23:53.791
SERIOUSLY?

23:53.793 --> 23:55.125
YEAH. COME ON.

23:55.127 --> 23:56.326
HEY, MARK, WHAT DO YOU NEED?

23:56.328 --> 23:57.861
UH, ANYTHING WE CAN USE,

23:57.863 --> 23:59.396
LETTERS, PHOTOS, DOCUMENTS.

23:59.398 --> 24:01.365
HEY, WHAT IF HE COMES BACK
WHILE YOU'RE IN THERE?

24:01.367 --> 24:03.666
WE'LL SIGNAL YOU TO LET YOU KNOW
THAT HE'S COMING.

24:03.668 --> 24:05.669
WITH WHAT, GENIUS?
BIRD NOISES?

24:05.671 --> 24:07.172
KEEP YOUR PHONE ON VIBRATE,
ALL RIGHT?

24:07.174 --> 24:09.076
WE'LL CALL YOU.

24:13.079 --> 24:16.013
- I THINK IT'S WORTH A SHOT.
- ALL RIGHT, COOL.

24:16.015 --> 24:18.349
- LESLIE, GIVE ME YOUR CAMERA.
- ALL RIGHT, SO GO INTO THE FRONT.

24:32.766 --> 24:34.668

OH, SHIT!

26:32.923 --> 26:34.825

26:47.172 --> 26:49.074

27:04.389 --> 27:06.292

29:02.945 --> 29:04.244

29:04.246 --> 29:05.713
THERE WAS SOMEBODY
IN THAT CHURCH.

29:05.715 --> 29:07.248
WE WERE WATCHING THE WHOLE TIME.
HE NEVER CAME BACK.

29:07.250 --> 29:09.016
- DUDE, THERE WAS SOMEBODY ELSE.
- WHO?

29:09.018 --> 29:10.951
I DON'T FUCKING KNOW.
I GOT THE FUCK OUTTA THERE.

29:10.953 --> 29:12.286
SHIT, THAT'S HIM! FUCK!

29:12.288 --> 29:14.288
- MARK...
- COME ON! COME ON!

29:16.393 --> 29:18.259
- I'M NOT DOING IT, ALL RIGHT.
- GET YOUR FOOT...

29:25.502 --> 29:28.035
I TOLD YOU ALL,
THIS WAS A BAD FUCKING IDEA!

29:28.037 --> 29:30.139
- RYAN, SIT DOWN!
- WHAT IF THAT MANIAC WOULD'VE GOTTEN YOU?

29:30.141 --> 29:33.074
- I HAD IT UNDER CONTROL.
- OH, YOU CALL THAT "UNDER CONTROL"?

29:33.076 --> 29:35.477
- HE'S PROBABLY CALLING THE COPS.
- WHY WOULD HE CALL THE COPS, RYAN?

29:35.479 --> 29:38.079
I DON'T KNOW. TRESPASSING,
BREAKING AND ENTERING.

29:38.081 --> 29:41.083
THIS THING STILL
HAS TEMPORARY TAGS.

29:41.085 --> 29:43.185
YOU ONLY CARE
ABOUT THE FUCKING MOVIE.

29:43.187 --> 29:45.554
THAT'S ALL YOU CARE ABOUT.
IT DOESN'T MATTER...

29:50.327 --> 29:52.327
NO ONE FORCED YOU TO BE HERE.

29:52.329 --> 29:53.763
OH, YEAH? AND YOU'RE GONNA DO
THIS ALL ON YOUR OWN?

29:53.765 --> 29:55.532
WHAT DID YOU THINK
WAS GONNA HAPPEN?

29:55.534 --> 29:57.366
- WELL, CERTAINLY NOT THAT, MARK...
- RYAN! RYAN!

29:57.368 --> 29:59.134
- YOU'RE OVERREACTING.
- AM I, LESLIE?

29:59.136 --> 30:00.670
WHAT'S THE NEXT STEP,
KIDNAPPING?

30:00.672 --> 30:02.438
- FORGET ABOUT IT.
- OH, NO, NO, NO.

30:02.440 --> 30:03.740
DO OTHER PEOPLE EVEN EXIST
IN YOUR MIND?

30:03.742 --> 30:05.542
IT WASN'T EVEN YOU
IN THE CHURCH.

30:05.544 --> 30:08.311
OH, WELL, EXCUSE ME FOR NOT
BEING ONE TO SET MYSELF ON FIRE

30:08.313 --> 30:09.679
TO GET YOUR FUCKING B-ROLL!

30:09.681 --> 30:11.181
IF YOU DON'T WANNA
BE A PART OF THIS,

30:11.183 --> 30:12.449
YOU ARE MORE THAN WELCOME
TO GO HOME.

30:12.451 --> 30:14.049
OH, MAN, YOU JUST DON'T GET IT,
DO YOU?

30:14.051 --> 30:15.585
YOU'RE SO CONSUMED
BY YOUR OWN NARCISSISM

30:15.587 --> 30:19.289
THAT YOU'RE COMPLETELY
OBLIVIOUS TO YOUR...

30:19.291 --> 30:20.490
YOUR... YOUR NOSE.

30:20.492 --> 30:21.692
WHAT?

30:21.694 --> 30:23.693
YOUR NOSE, YOU'RE BLEEDING.

30:23.695 --> 30:25.228
FUCK, YOU ARE.
YOU OKAY?

30:25.230 --> 30:26.729
- I'M FINE.
- SHIT!

30:26.731 --> 30:28.364
- I'M FINE. IT'S NOTHING.
- NO, MARK, MARK, TAKE...

30:28.366 --> 30:30.167
- I HAVE EPILEPSY, ALL RIGHT.
- MARK, TAKE A SEAT

30:30.169 --> 30:32.169
- AND LET US TAKE A LOOK AT IT.
- I SAID I'M FINE.

30:32.171 --> 30:33.537
JESUS, YOU WON'T EVEN LET
SOMEBODY ELSE HELP YOU.

30:33.539 --> 30:35.071
I DON'T NEED YOUR FUCKING HELP!

30:35.073 --> 30:36.174
I'VE...

30:42.448 --> 30:44.381
- MARK, I AM JUST TRYING...
- JUST LEAVE HIM ALONE.

30:44.383 --> 30:45.683
WHAT, AND LET HIM BLEED OUT?

30:45.685 --> 30:47.685
YOU KNOW WHAT?
HE SAID HE WAS FINE.

30:47.687 --> 30:50.387
AM I THE ONLY PERSON THAT'S
CONCERNED ABOUT HIS WELL-BEING?

30:50.389 --> 30:52.724
IF YOU WOULD STOP ARGUING
FOR TWO FUCKING...

30:52.726 --> 30:54.628
I NEED SOME AIR.

32:24.720 --> 32:25.821
HEY.

32:27.923 --> 32:30.827
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT SOMETHING.

32:32.929 --> 32:34.929
ALL RIGHT, WHAT?

32:34.931 --> 32:38.200
I DON'T KNOW HOW THIS HAPPENED.

32:43.808 --> 32:46.507
LISTEN, I KNOW WE HAVEN'T HAD
MUCH OF A CHANCE TO TALK.

32:46.509 --> 32:48.276
WHAT'S WRONG?

32:48.278 --> 32:49.744
LISTEN, OKAY.

32:49.746 --> 32:51.512
YOU KNOW HOW I WAS PLAYING
WITH ACE'S CAMERA

32:51.514 --> 32:54.418
BEFORE WE WENT UPSTAIRS?

32:57.688 --> 33:01.556
UM... TODAY,

33:01.558 --> 33:03.593
WHEN I WAS FORMATTING
THOSE CARDS...

33:08.499 --> 33:11.402
...I FOUND THIS CLIP.

33:12.870 --> 33:16.775
OF US... UPSTAIRS.

33:24.215 --> 33:25.547
HOW IS THAT FUCKING POSSIBLE?

33:25.549 --> 33:27.549
I DON'T KNOW.

33:27.551 --> 33:30.253
WELL, WHO THE FUCK
WOULD'VE DONE THAT?

33:30.255 --> 33:34.223
I DON'T KNOW, RYAN.

33:34.225 --> 33:35.759
WELL, LET'S THINK.
WHO ELSE WAS AT THE PARTY?

33:35.761 --> 33:38.762
THAT'S NOT THE POINT
THAT I'M TRYING TO MAKE.

33:38.764 --> 33:43.768
THE POINT IS THAT
IT WAS MARK'S MEMORY CARD.

33:43.770 --> 33:46.672
OH, SHIT.

33:49.708 --> 33:52.510
WELL, HE WOULD HAVE
SAID SOMETHING...

33:52.512 --> 33:54.414
BY NOW, RIGHT?

33:55.815 --> 33:56.916
YEAH.

33:59.018 --> 34:00.853
MAYBE.

34:01.954 --> 34:03.888
MAYBE.

34:03.890 --> 34:05.423
WE SHOULD CONFRONT HIM.

34:05.425 --> 34:07.425
NO. ARE YOU FUCKING CRAZY?

34:07.427 --> 34:08.693
HE'S BEEN KEEPING THIS FROM US
FOR HOW LONG?

34:08.695 --> 34:10.761
NOW IS NOT THE TIME.

34:10.763 --> 34:12.263
YEAH, THE TIME WAS
TWO WEEKS AGO.

34:12.264 --> 34:13.831
OKAY. NO, WAIT.

34:13.833 --> 34:15.833
WHAT IF HE DIDN'T EVEN SEE IT?

34:15.835 --> 34:19.739
COME ON, LESLIE, YOU KNOW
HE WOULD'VE ERASED IT BY NOW.

34:21.574 --> 34:24.574
MAYBE HE MISSED THIS ONE.

34:24.577 --> 34:26.377
REALLY? MR. OCD?

34:26.379 --> 34:27.978
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

34:27.981 --> 34:30.884
THIS ISN'T JUST ABOUT MARK.

34:33.587 --> 34:35.489
YOU'RE RIGHT, IT'S NOT.

34:37.558 --> 34:39.591
RYAN, NO.

34:39.592 --> 34:41.393
WAIT. STOP.

34:41.395 --> 34:43.395
MARK.

34:43.397 --> 34:44.864
- RYAN!
- MARK!

34:44.866 --> 34:46.431
RYAN.

34:46.433 --> 34:48.900
LESLIE, GET OUT OF MY WAY.

34:48.902 --> 34:50.768
- HEY. MARK.
- MARK, LISTEN TO ME.

34:50.771 --> 34:53.306
ALL RIGHT, MARK?

34:53.308 --> 34:55.308
- YO, MARK.
- WHAT'S WRONG?

34:55.310 --> 34:57.309
MARK?

34:57.311 --> 34:58.778
HEY.

34:58.780 --> 35:00.913
MARK?

35:00.915 --> 35:03.950
- WHAT THE FUCK, MAN?
- HEY.

35:03.952 --> 35:05.953
- MARK.
- HEY.

35:05.955 --> 35:08.955
MARK. HEY.

35:08.957 --> 35:10.957
LOOK AT ME.

35:10.959 --> 35:12.861
ARE YOU OKAY?

35:16.532 --> 35:19.434
WHAT THE FUCK?

35:26.574 --> 35:29.478
I NEED SOME SLEEP.

35:30.913 --> 35:32.815
OKAY.

35:35.117 --> 35:38.020
THAT WAS WEIRD AS SHIT.

35:44.393 --> 35:47.296
WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT ABOUT?

35:59.676 --> 36:01.375
WHAT THE HELL ARE WE
STILL DOING HERE?

36:01.377 --> 36:02.946
I DON'T FUCKING KNOW, MAN.

36:04.381 --> 36:06.381
CAN WE TALK IN PRIVATE?

36:06.383 --> 36:10.087
CAN YOU JUST DRIVE US
SOMEPLACE SAFE TONIGHT?

36:11.688 --> 36:13.590
HOW ABOUT A HOSPITAL?

36:16.093 --> 36:17.829
IT'S FINE. UM...

36:20.097 --> 36:23.098
I'M JUST GONNA GO TO BED.

36:23.100 --> 36:24.766
WE CAN TALK ABOUT IT
IN THE MORNING, OKAY?

36:24.768 --> 36:26.670
GOOD NIGHT.

36:40.152 --> 36:42.120
LET'S GO.

36:46.191 --> 36:49.192
THIS TRIP KEEPS GETTING
WEIRDER AND WEIRDER.

36:49.194 --> 36:51.529
YEAH, MAN, TELL ME ABOUT IT.

36:53.199 --> 36:56.199
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS,
BUT SOMETHING ISN'T RIGHT.

36:56.201 --> 37:00.203
SO, HERE TAKE THIS.

37:00.205 --> 37:01.807
HIT IT.

37:03.208 --> 37:05.209
SO WHAT?

37:05.211 --> 37:08.845
DUDE, WE'RE MAKING A FILM
ABOUT THE FUCKING DEVIL

37:08.847 --> 37:13.717
WITH, LIKE, DEMONIC FORCES
AND, LIKE, FUCKING CRAZY SHIT.

37:13.719 --> 37:17.722
COME ON, MAN, I THOUGHT YOU
SAID THIS WAS ALL BULLSHIT.

37:17.724 --> 37:20.224
YEAH, DUDE, IT IS.

37:20.226 --> 37:23.761
BUT YOU GOTTA ADMIT,
THERE'S A LOT OF FUCKING WEIRD SHIT

37:23.763 --> 37:26.763
THAT KEEPS HAPPENING
IN THIS TOWN.

37:26.765 --> 37:29.634
SO, YOU'RE A BELIEVER NOW?

37:29.636 --> 37:31.969
I WOULDN'T SAY THAT,
BUT YOU REMEMBER

37:31.971 --> 37:35.673
WHEN WE WERE SHOOTING ALL
THAT JEWELRY AND SHIT

37:35.675 --> 37:37.675
- IN THE CEMETERY?
- YEAH.

37:37.677 --> 37:40.679
YO, CHECK THIS OUT.

37:40.681 --> 37:43.681
LOOK AT IT.

37:43.683 --> 37:46.018
WHAT, YOU TOOK THAT?

37:46.020 --> 37:48.020
NAH, MAN, I DIDN'T FUCKING
TAKE THAT SHIT.

37:48.022 --> 37:52.024
REMEMBER WE WERE SHOOTING IT
AND THAT FUCKING GUY CAME?

37:52.026 --> 37:54.260
WHEN WE GOT THE FUCK OUT OF
THERE I CAME BACK TO THE RV

37:54.262 --> 37:56.161
AND IT WAS IN
MY FUCKING POCKET, DUDE.

37:56.163 --> 37:58.163
SO, YOU THINK THAT
HAS SOMETHING TO DO

37:58.165 --> 37:59.698
WITH EVERYTHING
THAT'S BEEN GOING ON.

37:59.700 --> 38:01.099
I DON'T FUCKING KNOW, MAN.

38:01.101 --> 38:03.567
BUT, COME ON, YOU GOT
A BETTER EXPLANATION?

38:03.569 --> 38:05.570
YEAH.

38:05.572 --> 38:07.706
MARK.

38:07.708 --> 38:08.907
LET ME SEE THAT.

38:08.909 --> 38:10.176
HIT IT.

38:10.178 --> 38:12.044
THE NECKLACE.

38:12.046 --> 38:13.845
OH.

38:13.847 --> 38:14.949
HERE.

38:17.052 --> 38:18.753
YOU LIKE THAT?

38:20.055 --> 38:21.690
YEAH, IT'S NICE.

38:23.058 --> 38:24.991
HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING, MAN?

38:24.993 --> 38:26.993
COME ON.
HEY, DUDE.

38:26.995 --> 38:28.795

38:28.797 --> 38:30.797
GODDAMN, MAN!

38:30.799 --> 38:32.799
SUCH A FUCKING DICK, DUDE!

38:32.801 --> 38:34.801
GODDAMN.

38:34.803 --> 38:37.303
BETTER BE SAFE THAN SORRY.

38:37.305 --> 38:39.207
DICKHEAD.

39:04.868 --> 39:06.769
MM?

39:08.338 --> 39:11.339
OH. SERIOUSLY, MARK?

39:11.341 --> 39:13.173
IT'S NOT FUNNY.

39:13.175 --> 39:15.109
LET'S SEE THAT
BEAUTIFUL SMILE OF YOURS.

39:15.111 --> 39:17.112
- NO.
- PLEASE.

39:17.114 --> 39:19.114
LET ME SEE IT.

39:19.116 --> 39:21.816
LET'S SEE A REAL SMILE.

39:21.818 --> 39:23.818
COME ON. COME ON.

39:23.820 --> 39:25.686
PLEASE, FOR ME?

39:27.324 --> 39:29.091
THERE WE GO.

39:29.093 --> 39:30.994
HERE. TAKE IT.

39:34.798 --> 39:36.798
I HAVE A SURPRISE FOR YOU.

39:36.800 --> 39:38.702
- WHAT IS IT?
- GONNA HAVE TO COME AND SEE.

39:54.719 --> 39:57.219
MMM. SOMETHING SMELLS GOOD!

39:57.221 --> 39:59.221
MM-HMM.

39:59.223 --> 40:01.090
DID YOU MAKE THIS?

40:01.092 --> 40:02.825
YEAH. HERE.

40:02.827 --> 40:06.731
WHAT? DEFINITELY GONNA
HAVE TO DOCUMENT THIS.

40:09.268 --> 40:10.966
GOOD MORNING, GUYS.

40:10.968 --> 40:12.870
GOOD MORNING.

40:16.409 --> 40:19.109
SO, WHAT DO YOU THINK?

40:19.111 --> 40:23.113
I'VE NEVER EVEN SEEN YOU
USE A TOASTER OVEN BEFORE.

40:23.115 --> 40:25.115
- SO...
- WELL, WE'VE GOT A BIG DAY AHEAD OF US,

40:25.117 --> 40:27.117
AND WE MAY NOT HAVE TIME TO EAT.

40:27.119 --> 40:28.952
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO FIND
THE BEST WAY INTO THE FACILITY

40:28.954 --> 40:30.954
SO WE CAN GET THE BEST SHOTS
BEFORE DARK.

40:30.956 --> 40:32.989
NOT TO PUT A DAMPER
ON THINGS, MAN,

40:32.991 --> 40:34.991
BUT DON'T YOU THINK WE SHOULD
TAKE IT EASY FOR A DAY OR TWO?

40:34.993 --> 40:36.860
NO. IT HAS TO BE TONIGHT.

40:36.862 --> 40:38.361
IT HAS TO BE THE SIXTH.

40:38.363 --> 40:41.365
IT'S WHAT MY RESEARCH SAID.

40:41.367 --> 40:43.367
DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME.
OKAY?

40:43.369 --> 40:45.236
I'M FINE.

40:45.238 --> 40:47.038
WE'VE MADE IT THIS FAR,
AND I REALLY THINK

40:47.040 --> 40:49.040
WE'RE ON THE CUSP OF
FIGURING THIS THING OUT.

40:49.042 --> 40:51.945
WE SHOULD GET INTO THE FACILITY,
SEE WHAT WE CAN GET.

41:13.467 --> 41:15.467
RYAN.

41:15.469 --> 41:17.403
I KNOW YOU'RE SITTING
IN YOUR CAVE RIGHT NOW

41:17.405 --> 41:19.771
LOOKING THROUGH
ALL MY AWESOME FOOTAGE,

41:19.773 --> 41:22.774
AND WONDERING
WHAT I'M ABOUT TO DO.

41:22.776 --> 41:25.246
BUT DON'T WORRY,
YOU'LL SOON FIND OUT.

41:27.381 --> 41:29.284
UH-HUH.

41:33.087 --> 41:35.087
OH, YEAH.

41:41.163 --> 41:42.764
HUH.

41:49.737 --> 41:52.071
WHAT THE FUCK?

41:52.073 --> 41:54.073
HOLY SHIT.

41:54.075 --> 41:55.977
FUCK THAT.

41:58.246 --> 42:00.280
SHIT.

42:00.282 --> 42:02.184
YOU GOTTA BE FUCKING KIDDING ME.

42:04.120 --> 42:06.022
HERE.

42:12.528 --> 42:14.528
SMELLS LIKE COOLANT.

42:14.530 --> 42:16.531
WELL, ARE YOU SURE?

42:16.533 --> 42:19.066
YEAH, I'M FUCKING SURE.

42:19.068 --> 42:20.968
I MEAN, THE GUY WHO I BOUGHT IT
FROM SAID IT WAS BURNING OIL.

42:20.970 --> 42:22.536
- SO, I'M PRETTY SURE...
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

42:22.538 --> 42:23.837
NO, I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE FUCK
I'M TALKING ABOUT.

42:23.839 --> 42:25.208
LOOK, CAN YOU FIX IT?

42:27.843 --> 42:30.844
GOTTA LET IT COOL DOWN FIRST.

42:30.846 --> 42:33.082
MURPHY'S FUCKING LAW.

42:51.435 --> 42:54.135
ACE, I HAVE AN IDEA.

42:54.137 --> 42:56.104
WHAT'S UP?

42:56.106 --> 42:57.806
HEY, SO THE MILLBROOK IS RIGHT
OVER THERE.

42:57.808 --> 43:00.308
- SO, I WAS THINKING-
- OH, HOLD ON.

43:00.310 --> 43:02.277
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
LOOKING UP MECHANICS.

43:02.279 --> 43:04.880
I WAS, BUT IT'S GONNA TAKE 'EM
A COUPLE HOURS TO GET HERE.

43:04.882 --> 43:07.049
SO, I THOUGHT
INSTEAD OF WASTING TIME,

43:07.051 --> 43:08.917
WE COULD GET SOME GOOD AERIAL
SHOTS OF THE FACILITY.

43:08.919 --> 43:10.219
COOL. LET'S DO IT.

43:10.221 --> 43:11.987
- ALL RIGHT.
- I'LL GRAB MY JACKET.

43:11.989 --> 43:13.922
NO, NO, YOU GOTTA STAY HERE
IN CASE SOMEONE DRIVES BY.

43:13.924 --> 43:16.828
THERE'S A SMALL CLEARING JUST UP
THE ROAD THAT SHOULD BE PERFECT.

43:21.032 --> 43:23.065
IS IT READY?

43:23.067 --> 43:24.934
- DO IT?
- OKAY, YEAH.

43:24.936 --> 43:26.837
NOW SPIN IT AROUND.

43:28.274 --> 43:30.175
NO, THE DRONE, YOU IDIOT.

43:44.990 --> 43:46.892
THERE IT IS.

43:51.062 --> 43:53.063
MM, TRY TO GET A LITTLE CLOSER.

43:53.065 --> 43:54.865
OH.

44:35.676 --> 44:38.176
SHIT, I'M NOT CONTROLLING IT.

44:38.178 --> 44:39.312
WHAT?

44:43.684 --> 44:45.451
DAMN IT.

44:45.453 --> 44:47.986
DUDE,
THOSE THINGS CRASH ALL THE TIME.

44:47.988 --> 44:50.155
NO, MAN, I BOUGHT THIS
WITH MY CREDIT CARD, MAN.

44:50.157 --> 44:52.158
IF I CAN'T GET IT FIXED,
THEN... FUCK.

44:52.160 --> 44:53.562
DAMN IT.

44:55.664 --> 44:57.566
THOSE THINGS ARE EXPENSIVE.

45:10.712 --> 45:12.614
ANY LUCK?

45:14.583 --> 45:16.517
A HUGE GASH
IN THE RADIATOR HOSE.

45:16.519 --> 45:18.519
SO...

45:18.521 --> 45:20.188
IS THAT SERIOUS?

45:23.291 --> 45:26.194
WE'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE
UNLESS IT'S FIXED, SO, YEAH.

45:34.504 --> 45:36.071
LESLIE.

45:43.747 --> 45:47.650
I'M SORRY ABOUT LAST NIGHT.

45:52.021 --> 45:56.023
I WASN'T THINKING STRAIGHT
AND I OVERREACTED.

45:56.025 --> 45:58.928
SHOULDN'T HAVE GONE OFF
HALF COCKED LIKE I DID.

46:08.472 --> 46:10.374
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

46:13.009 --> 46:15.713
I THINK WE WERE ALL
A LITTLE ON EDGE LAST NIGHT.

46:20.551 --> 46:22.384
IT'S JUST
THAT I'M REALLY HAPPY,

46:22.386 --> 46:24.186
AND IF THERE'S ANY WAY
HE DIDN'T SEE THAT VIDEO...

46:24.188 --> 46:27.055
YOU'RE REALLY HAPPY?

46:27.057 --> 46:28.460
OF COURSE.

46:30.562 --> 46:32.129
JUST...

46:36.468 --> 46:37.569
WHAT?

46:44.810 --> 46:47.111
YOU REMEMBER WHEN...

46:48.813 --> 46:51.280
WE DECIDED THINGS WEREN'T
WORKING OUT BETWEEN US

46:51.282 --> 46:56.187
AND WE AGREED THAT WE'RE BETTER
OFF AS JUST FRIENDS?

47:05.498 --> 47:07.166
WELL, I LIED.

47:09.502 --> 47:12.503
I DIDN'T AGREE TO THAT.

47:12.505 --> 47:14.371
SO THIS WHOLE TIME...

47:14.373 --> 47:17.276
IT WAS... IT WAS THE LESSER
OF TWO EVILS.

47:22.214 --> 47:24.116
THAT IS SO UNFAIR.

47:27.554 --> 47:32.190
I... I DID MY BEST TO BURY IT,
BUT THEN AT THE PARTY...

47:32.192 --> 47:34.526
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?

47:34.528 --> 47:36.528
YOU WANT ME TO JUST LEAVE MARK?

47:36.530 --> 47:38.530
YOU CAN'T SERIOUSLY TELL ME
YOU'RE HAPPY WITH HIM.

47:38.532 --> 47:41.533
HALF THE TIME HE ACTS
LIKE YOU DON'T EVEN EXIST.

47:41.535 --> 47:44.870
I DON'T HAVE TO JUSTIFY
MY LOVE LIFE TO YOU.

47:44.872 --> 47:46.504
HE DOESN'T VALUE YOUR OPINION.

47:46.506 --> 47:48.506
HE DOESN'T SEE YOU
AS A PRIORITY.

47:48.508 --> 47:52.344
I DOUBT HE EVEN HAS
THE ABILITY TO LOVE YOU.

47:52.346 --> 47:57.181
YOU'RE JUST BITTER BECAUSE
HE'S EVERYTHING YOU WANT TO BE.

47:57.183 --> 47:59.785
YEAH. YEAH, YEAH, RIGHT,

47:59.787 --> 48:02.855
A CONDESCENDING,
EGOTISTICAL SOCIOPATH.

48:02.857 --> 48:05.124
RIGHT, THAT'S MY GOAL.

48:05.126 --> 48:07.426
AT LEAST HE'S DRIVEN.

48:07.428 --> 48:09.862
HE'S DETERMINED AND WHEN HE
SETS OUT TO DO SOMETHING,

48:09.864 --> 48:12.831
HE ACTUALLY DOES IT.

48:12.833 --> 48:14.567
WHAT HAVE YOU EVER DONE?

48:14.569 --> 48:16.505
WHAT HAVE YOU EVER
EVEN STARTED?

48:22.176 --> 48:23.676
TELL ME THIS.

48:23.678 --> 48:25.546
IF HE'S SO PERFECT...

48:27.916 --> 48:30.152
...THEN WHAT WAS THAT
AT THE PARTY?

48:33.555 --> 48:35.189
A MISTAKE?

48:36.625 --> 48:39.860
OR YOU JUST GONNA KEEP
LYING TO YOURSELF?

48:39.862 --> 48:42.429
YOU ARE SO FUCKING CLUELESS.

48:42.431 --> 48:44.299
TELL ME I'M WRONG.

48:54.444 --> 48:55.778
HOW'S IT LOOKING?

48:59.515 --> 49:01.214
SHOT TO HELL.

49:01.216 --> 49:02.683
WELL, GOOD JOB, GUYS.

49:02.685 --> 49:04.552
HOW'D IT GO?

49:04.554 --> 49:07.722
WELL, MARK SHOULD
NOT BE CONTROLLING DRONES.

49:07.724 --> 49:09.490
- WHAT HAPPENED?
- GOOD QUESTION.

49:09.492 --> 49:11.459
HE FUCKING CRASHED
THAT SHIT ON THE ROOF.

49:11.461 --> 49:13.594
SHIT. WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

49:13.596 --> 49:15.497
I SAY WE GRAB THE
GEAR AND START WALKING.

49:15.499 --> 49:17.331
HOW FAR AWAY
IS THE ENTRANCE?

49:17.333 --> 49:18.500
IT'S RIGHT OVER
THERE THROUGH THE WOODS.

49:18.502 --> 49:20.269
WE CAN'T LEAVE YET.

49:21.939 --> 49:26.474
- THE MECHANIC.
- YEAH, ABOUT THAT?

49:26.476 --> 49:28.443
I DIDN'T ACTUALLY
CALL ANYONE.

49:28.445 --> 49:29.845
- WHOA, WHOA...
- WHAT THE FUCK?

49:29.847 --> 49:31.680
- WHAT?
- I KNEW THAT IF WE HAD TO WAIT

49:31.682 --> 49:32.814
FOR A TOW TRUCK,
THERE'D BE NO WAY

49:32.816 --> 49:34.249
WE COULD GET THERE BY MIDNIGHT.

49:34.251 --> 49:36.420
SO YOU JUST LIED
TO OUR FUCKING FACES.

49:37.888 --> 49:39.421
WHY DIDN'T YOU
JUST TELL US THE TRUTH?

49:39.423 --> 49:40.723
WE'RE ALL
ON THE SAME TEAM, MARK.

49:40.725 --> 49:42.692
'CAUSE I KNEW THIS WOULD HAPPEN.

49:42.694 --> 49:44.526
EITHER WAY, LET'S JUST GO,

49:44.528 --> 49:46.595
GRAB THE FOOTAGE TONIGHT,
SLEEP IN THE RV,

49:46.597 --> 49:50.135
AND, UH, YOU KNOW,
FIX THIS SHIT TOMORROW.

50:05.316 --> 50:07.552
I REALLY NEED
TO KEEP AN EYE ON MARK.

50:10.789 --> 50:12.624
GUESS HE'S SUPPOSED
TO BE DOING BETTER?

50:14.626 --> 50:17.961
IT'S NOT EXACTLY HIS HEALTH
THAT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT.

50:17.963 --> 50:20.964
WHAT?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

50:20.966 --> 50:24.300
WELL, I'M NOT SO SURE IT WAS NORMAL
WEAR AND TEAR THAT STALLED US.

50:24.302 --> 50:26.302
YOU THINK MARK
SABOTAGED US, MAN?

50:26.304 --> 50:28.739
COME ON.
COME ON.

50:28.741 --> 50:32.776
I'VE NEVER SEEN A HOSE GET
THAT MANGLED BEFORE ON ITS OWN.

50:32.778 --> 50:35.746
DUDE,
IT WAS PROBABLY A RACCOON OR SOMETHING.

50:35.748 --> 50:38.381
COME ON, WE'RE
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WOODS.

50:38.383 --> 50:40.687
YEAH, POSSIBLY.

50:42.923 --> 50:46.423
BUT THIS MORNING AT BREAKFAST,

50:46.425 --> 50:48.692
I SAW THIS BLACK SMUDGE
ON MARK'S HAND.

50:48.694 --> 50:51.398
WHAT THE FUCK, MAN?
WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY ANYTHING?

50:53.433 --> 50:56.868
HE KNOWS HE CAN'T FINISH
THIS FILM WITHOUT US,

50:56.870 --> 50:59.671
AND WITH EVERYTHING
THAT HAPPENED LAST NIGHT,

50:59.673 --> 51:02.439
MAYBE HE HAD TO GUARANTEE
WE WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO BAIL.

51:02.441 --> 51:04.011
OH... YEAH.

51:06.379 --> 51:07.481
MAYBE.

51:09.050 --> 51:10.484
OR...

51:13.520 --> 51:15.321
OR WHAT?

51:15.323 --> 51:18.893
I FOUND THAT SAME NECKLACE
IN THE BATHROOM THIS MORNING.

51:22.362 --> 51:24.496
THE SAME NECKLACE
FROM LAST NIGHT?

51:24.498 --> 51:27.802
YEAH, DUDE,
THE SAME FUCKING NECKLACE.

51:30.905 --> 51:33.639
- ARE YOU SURE?
- YEAH, I'M SURE.

51:33.641 --> 51:36.744
COME ON, MAN.
I'M NOT A FUCKING IDIOT.

51:40.749 --> 51:43.018
ACE! YOU HAVE TO GET THIS.

51:44.585 --> 51:45.952
OH, MAN, ARE THESE REAL?

51:45.954 --> 51:48.788
HOW OLD DO YOU THINK THESE ARE?

51:48.790 --> 51:51.825
HEY, GET THE ANGLE OVER HERE.

51:51.827 --> 51:53.395
YEAH, RIGHT THERE.

51:55.931 --> 51:57.432
LOOK AT THESE.

51:58.834 --> 52:01.835
I DON'T BELIEVE IT, WOW.

52:01.837 --> 52:04.071
- WHAT IF THIS IS THE PLACE?
- WHAT PLACE?

52:04.073 --> 52:05.940
- THE THREE YOUNG ONES.
- THE FUCK IS THIS?

52:05.942 --> 52:08.508
YOU SAID THEY WERE
ALL KILLED IN STOCKS, RIGHT?

52:08.510 --> 52:09.745
SHIT.

52:13.649 --> 52:15.449
MARK...

52:15.451 --> 52:17.518
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

52:17.520 --> 52:19.956
MARK, WHAT IF CHILDREN
REALLY DID DIE IN THAT?

52:28.531 --> 52:30.865
WHAT'S UP WITH
ALL THESE VIGIL CANDLES?

52:30.867 --> 52:35.169
- NO, THEY'RE NOT VIGIL.
- WHAT ARE THEY, THEN?

52:37.640 --> 52:39.106
SHIT!

52:39.108 --> 52:40.909
MARK, WHAT'S THE MATTER?

52:40.911 --> 52:42.478
ARE YOU OKAY?

52:43.981 --> 52:46.581
- MARK, TALK TO ME.
- HEY, MARK, YOU BREATHING?

52:46.583 --> 52:48.783
TAKE DEEP...
GUYS, GIVE HIM SOME SPACE, PLEASE!

52:48.785 --> 52:51.954
- STAND HIM UP!
- JUST GIVE HIM SOME SPACE.

52:51.956 --> 52:55.958
- MARK, TAKE IT EASY, MAN.
- HELP HIM UP! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

52:55.960 --> 52:59.027
- MARK...
- COME ON.

52:59.029 --> 53:00.796
COME ON, I'VE GOT YOU.

53:00.798 --> 53:03.166
YOU ALL RIGHT, MAN?

53:03.168 --> 53:04.600
WE NEED TO GO BACK
TO THE RV NOW.

53:04.602 --> 53:06.635
NO, NO.

53:06.637 --> 53:08.871
- YOU'VE GOTTA SEE A DOCTOR.
- NO, I'M CALLING IT.

53:08.873 --> 53:11.773
TURN OFF THE CAMERAS. WE'RE NOT
GOING ANY FURTHER UNTIL YOU GET HELP.

53:11.775 --> 53:15.778
COME ON. WE CAN COME BACK
AND DO THIS ANOTHER TIME.

53:15.780 --> 53:17.013
OKAY? LET'S JUST GO
TO THE HOSPITAL.

53:17.015 --> 53:19.816
NO, WE HAVE
TO KEEP GOING, OKAY?

53:19.818 --> 53:21.918
- YOU'RE CRAZY, MAN.
- NO, NO, NO.

53:21.920 --> 53:24.486
WE CAN'T GO TO THAT PLACE NOW, MARK.
WE JUST CAN'T.

53:24.488 --> 53:26.488
- YES, WE CAN, OKAY?
- TELL HIM.

53:26.490 --> 53:27.992
- WE'LL FIND A WAY IN.
- TELL HIM WHAT?

53:27.994 --> 53:29.226
TELL HIM ABOUT THE NECKLACE.

53:29.228 --> 53:32.162
TELL HIM ABOUT
THE FUCKING RV, MAN.

53:32.164 --> 53:33.763
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS
TALKING ABOUT?

53:33.765 --> 53:35.098
LAST NIGHT, ACE FOUND
ONE OF THOSE NECKLACES

53:35.100 --> 53:38.534
IN HIS POCKET
FROM THE GRAVEYARD.

53:38.536 --> 53:39.970
AND THEN I THREW IT
OUT THE WINDOW,

53:39.972 --> 53:41.705
AND THEN EVER SINCE THEN,
THINGS HAVE BEEN FUCKED.

53:41.707 --> 53:43.506
ALL THE MORE REASON
TO NOT GO BACK, OKAY?

53:43.508 --> 53:45.843
LOOK, MARK, YOU CAN HARDLY
FUCKING WALK RIGHT NOW,

53:45.845 --> 53:48.711
SO THERE'S NO WAY YOU'RE GONNA BE
ABLE TO SHOOT FOR 12 HOURS, ANYWAY!

53:48.713 --> 53:51.216
OKAY, I'VE PUT EVERYTHING
ON THE LINE FOR THIS.

53:51.218 --> 53:53.751
I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE,
BUT YOU CAN'T RISK YOUR LIFE...

53:53.753 --> 53:55.554
WE HAVE TO GO IN!

54:04.664 --> 54:08.866
I KNOW I HAVEN'T BEEN
THE EASIEST PERSON TO WORK WITH,

54:08.868 --> 54:13.003
AND I KNOW I HAVEN'T SHOWN
YOU GUYS MUCH APPRECIATION,

54:13.005 --> 54:16.808
BUT PLEASE,
I CAN'T DO THIS ALONE.

54:16.810 --> 54:19.544
I NEED YOU GUYS.

54:19.546 --> 54:22.579
TOMORROW I'LL GO SEE A DOCTOR,

54:22.581 --> 54:25.984
A HOSPITAL, GET SOME REST,
WHATEVER IT TAKES.

54:25.986 --> 54:28.753
OKAY, I JUST...
I NEED YOU GUYS,

54:28.755 --> 54:32.592
AND I PROMISE I WILL
MAKE IT UP TO ALL OF YOU.

54:35.595 --> 54:38.031
YOU JUST HAVE TO TRUST ME.

54:42.804 --> 54:45.139
THERE SHOULD BE A WAY IN
JUST DOWN THE HILL.

54:55.116 --> 54:56.816
GUYS, WE CAN'T JUST
LET HIM GO ON HIS OWN.

54:56.818 --> 54:58.951
FUCK HIM.

54:58.953 --> 55:01.120
WE'VE DONE EVERYTHING WE CAN.
WE NEED TO GO BACK TO THE RV

55:01.122 --> 55:03.056
AND ACTUALLY CALL SOMEONE.

55:03.058 --> 55:04.925
HE'S OUT OF HIS FUCKING MIND
AND YOU'D LET HIM JUST GO?

55:04.927 --> 55:06.893
HE CAN'T DO THIS BY HIMSELF,
HE JUST SAID SO,

55:06.895 --> 55:08.728
AND THE SOONER HE GETS THAT
THROUGH HIS THICK FUCKING SKULL...

55:08.730 --> 55:10.263
I'M NOT GONNA LEAVE HIM.

55:10.265 --> 55:12.033
WELL, THEN YOU'RE
JUST AS CRAZY AS HE IS.

55:13.568 --> 55:14.635
FUCK YOU!

55:23.812 --> 55:24.980
YOU TOO?

55:26.949 --> 55:28.715
CAN'T LET THEM GO ALONE.

55:28.717 --> 55:30.619
FUCK IT, MAN.

56:18.235 --> 56:19.904
THERE YOU ARE.

56:21.238 --> 56:22.706
IS THIS IT?

56:23.908 --> 56:26.043
HERE, GIVE THIS TO ME.

56:33.918 --> 56:35.351
ALL RIGHT.

56:35.353 --> 56:36.887
EVERYONE READY?

57:10.156 --> 57:12.057
FUCKING IDIOT.

57:20.733 --> 57:24.669
GOD,
WHO THE FUCK PAINTS THIS SHIT?

57:26.838 --> 57:28.273
EW.

57:28.275 --> 57:29.740
HEY, I NEED THE LIGHT.

57:29.742 --> 57:31.644
- SORRY.
- IT'S ALL RIGHT.

57:33.280 --> 57:35.181
OH, DON'T CRY.

58:25.066 --> 58:26.969
LET'S GO, RYAN.

58:29.405 --> 58:32.308
SMELLS LIKE
SOMETHING DIED IN HERE.

59:14.884 --> 59:17.787
LOOKS LIKE WE MISSED THE PARTY.

59:20.090 --> 59:22.090
CAREFUL THERE.

59:22.092 --> 59:24.027
LOOK AT ALL THESE PAPERS.

59:33.337 --> 59:35.337
HEY. LOOK.

59:35.339 --> 59:37.205
WHAT IS THAT?

59:37.207 --> 59:39.110
IT'S A SIGIL.

59:41.045 --> 59:42.947
WAIT.

59:49.453 --> 59:51.488
YEAH.

59:51.490 --> 59:54.491
THEY'RE ON ALL OF 'EM.

59:54.493 --> 59:56.493
SHIT.

59:56.495 --> 59:59.397
ARE YOU GETTING THIS?

01:00:02.868 --> 01:00:05.570
HOW ARE THEY ON ALL OF THEM?

01:00:11.209 --> 01:00:13.110
YOU GET THAT?

01:01:04.698 --> 01:01:06.600
OOH LA LA!

01:01:34.629 --> 01:01:36.531
OH YEAH, BABY.

01:01:39.968 --> 01:01:42.370
WELL, SHE DEFINITELY LOOKS
POSSESSED.

01:02:07.563 --> 01:02:09.430
SCARED?

01:02:09.432 --> 01:02:11.333
SUCH A FUCKING ASSHOLE.

01:02:26.382 --> 01:02:29.286
OH, SHIT.

01:02:33.790 --> 01:02:36.526
LET'S GO DOWN.

01:03:03.654 --> 01:03:05.521
NICE.

01:03:05.523 --> 01:03:07.156
GET A GOOD ANGLE.

01:03:07.158 --> 01:03:09.692
SEE THAT?
YOU GETTING IT?

01:03:09.694 --> 01:03:11.560
- YEAH, I SEE IT.
- YOU SEE IT? YOU SEE IT?

01:03:11.562 --> 01:03:13.362
ALL RIGHT, PAN UP A LITTLE BIT.

01:03:13.364 --> 01:03:14.664
- OKAY.
- ZOOM IN.

01:03:14.666 --> 01:03:17.569
LOOKS GOOD. YEAH.

01:03:23.775 --> 01:03:26.776
A FOR ACE.

01:03:26.778 --> 01:03:29.779
