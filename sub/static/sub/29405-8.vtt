WEBVTT

00:04.172 --> 00:05.162
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

00:05.173 --> 00:06.413
<i>please head to your seats.</i>

00:06.490 --> 00:08.164
<i>The show is about to begin.</i>

00:11.370 --> 00:12.845
We're in our seats now.

00:12.922 --> 00:16.015
Yeah, they are totally excited.

00:18.711 --> 00:21.521
I did. I spoke to the usher
on the way in.

00:21.597 --> 00:22.691
Of course it's age-appropriate.

00:22.715 --> 00:24.640
It's an ice show.

00:24.717 --> 00:26.194
Pure family friendly
entertainment.

00:26.218 --> 00:28.247
- You're such an ass!
- Call me that again,

00:28.271 --> 00:29.823
- and I'll drop you on yours.
- Try it.

00:29.847 --> 00:31.438
Then try sleeping
with one eye open

00:31.515 --> 00:33.357
- for the rest of the tour.
- We don't sleep together

00:33.368 --> 00:34.358
anymore, sweetheart.

00:34.369 --> 00:35.369
Remember?

00:35.444 --> 00:37.036
You two are exhausting.

00:37.113 --> 00:38.487
Shut the hell up, Randy!

01:00.728 --> 01:05.272
Come on. Guys, that's...
You know... fun.

01:07.068 --> 01:09.518
Should've broken up with you
back in Tucson.

01:09.595 --> 01:10.864
Shouldn't have dated you at all.

01:10.888 --> 01:12.229
Never settle
for the bronze medalist.

01:12.240 --> 01:13.897
Why don't you take
your gold medal and shove it...

01:13.908 --> 01:15.241
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

01:15.318 --> 01:17.318
<i>please welcome
Hansel and Gretel.</i>

01:28.331 --> 01:30.590
Whoo!

01:39.291 --> 01:41.216
Oh, my God!

01:42.544 --> 01:44.261
Holy moly!

01:44.272 --> 01:46.597
- Whoa!
- Awesome!

01:49.259 --> 01:51.560
I haven't seen
this much blood on the ice

01:51.637 --> 01:54.280
since a squirrel crawled
into the Zamboni.

01:54.357 --> 01:55.651
Any idea what caused
the accident?

01:55.675 --> 01:57.900
Well, the Snowy Owls
were finishing up

01:57.976 --> 01:59.120
their "Free in the Forest" bit.

01:59.144 --> 02:00.786
Hansel and Gretel hit the ice

02:00.863 --> 02:01.945
for their breadcrumb schtick.

02:01.956 --> 02:04.239
And, boom.
Bloodbath on ice.

02:04.316 --> 02:05.699
What's the story, Chim?

02:05.776 --> 02:07.462
These two children
are abandoned in the woods.

02:07.486 --> 02:08.963
They come upon
a gingerbread house

02:08.987 --> 02:12.247
where a witch entices them...

02:12.324 --> 02:14.083
It was a multi-skater pile-up.

02:14.159 --> 02:16.126
Most of the injuries are minor
except for that guy.

02:16.137 --> 02:17.544
He lost four digits.

02:17.621 --> 02:19.358
We hit him with a local
anesthetic to transport,

02:19.382 --> 02:20.798
still gotta
find the fingers, though.

02:20.808 --> 02:22.475
What about Hansel and Gretel?

02:22.551 --> 02:24.885
Hansel took Gretel's blade
to the torso.

02:24.962 --> 02:26.865
We propped him up
to minimize the damage.

02:26.889 --> 02:28.608
The skate's buried
about 3 centimeters

02:28.632 --> 02:30.307
into his chest,
barely missed the heart.

02:30.318 --> 02:31.600
He doesn't have a heart.

02:31.677 --> 02:34.320
Really?
We're doing this now?

02:34.397 --> 02:35.990
Think you can cut her foot
out of the skate

02:36.014 --> 02:37.826
- so we can transport them?
- It'll probably be easy

02:37.850 --> 02:39.452
- if they stop arguing.
- Yeah, then you might wanna

02:39.476 --> 02:40.879
- sedate her.
- And I need trauma shears.

02:40.903 --> 02:41.903
I can't find mine.

02:44.740 --> 02:46.540
This is a laryngoscope.

02:48.193 --> 02:49.159
Oh, right, sorry.

02:49.170 --> 02:50.503
What were you thinking?

02:50.579 --> 02:52.298
Breaking up with me
an hour before show time?

02:52.322 --> 02:53.839
I didn't wanna be distracted.

02:53.916 --> 02:55.468
You know, it's hard enough
catching you mid-air

02:55.492 --> 02:56.676
at 15 miles an hour.

02:56.752 --> 02:57.918
I'm not a Frisbee, Boyd.

02:57.995 --> 02:59.503
I'm a partner.

02:59.514 --> 03:01.922
- At least I was.
- Found two fingers, Cap.

03:01.999 --> 03:03.902
Still looking for
the other ones.

03:03.926 --> 03:06.260
- Hey, got the pinkie.
- All right.

03:06.336 --> 03:08.020
Three down, one to go.

03:08.097 --> 03:10.514
You should be able
to sew those back on, right?

03:10.525 --> 03:12.077
Well, they've been on ice
the whole time,

03:12.101 --> 03:13.417
- so that'll help.
- He shouldn't have to

03:13.419 --> 03:16.812
lose his fingers
to Sid and Nancy's psychodrama.

03:16.889 --> 03:19.022
- You did this on purpose.
- Impaled myself?

03:19.033 --> 03:20.524
You thought I was
leaving you behind,

03:20.535 --> 03:23.444
so you tried to hobble me,
and it backfired.

03:23.520 --> 03:25.529
The kicker, Boyd,
I wasn't leaving.

03:25.540 --> 03:27.656
I know!

03:27.733 --> 03:30.543
That's why I broke up with you.

03:30.619 --> 03:33.504
Because you were gonna
turn them down.

03:35.240 --> 03:37.833
"Disney on Ice."
The big leagues.

03:37.910 --> 03:39.501
So they were fighting
over her leaving.

03:39.578 --> 03:42.221
Figured they'd shake it off
once they hit the ice.

03:42.298 --> 03:45.048
But then one of the Snowy Owls
went full toe pick,

03:45.059 --> 03:48.561
and everyone hit the ice.

03:48.637 --> 03:50.179
Did you say "toe pick"?

03:50.255 --> 03:51.722
Hen, you ready?

03:51.733 --> 03:53.232
Okay.

03:56.428 --> 03:58.738
Ah.

04:05.321 --> 04:06.737
You broke up with me
so I wouldn't turn down.

04:06.748 --> 04:09.364
"Disney on Ice"?

04:09.441 --> 04:11.292
It's always been your dream.

04:12.778 --> 04:16.329
No. This is my dream.

04:16.406 --> 04:18.749
Being out on the ice with you.

04:18.760 --> 04:22.211
You're just saying that
'cause I could die.

04:22.287 --> 04:23.837
Pretty sure you're gonna live.

04:23.914 --> 04:26.766
See? Even the nice paramedic
thinks you're an idiot.

04:34.550 --> 04:36.725
Yes! I got the middle one.

04:39.280 --> 04:41.230
Hey... hey, Cap.

04:41.306 --> 04:43.232
We... we found all the fingers.

04:43.308 --> 04:45.067
Cap, victims
are being transported.

04:45.143 --> 04:46.287
Our work here's done.

04:46.311 --> 04:47.620
Great.

04:49.314 --> 04:50.739
Ah.

04:55.779 --> 04:57.746
Found it.

04:57.823 --> 05:01.583
- What's that?
- A sequin.

05:01.660 --> 05:03.460
When your blade
runs across one of these,

05:03.471 --> 05:05.796
it stops your skates
dead in their tracks.

05:05.807 --> 05:08.048
Wait, one sequin
did all of this?

05:08.125 --> 05:09.550
A wardrobe malfunction

05:09.626 --> 05:11.396
can be the most dangerous part
of figure skating.

05:11.420 --> 05:14.429
So how come you know so much
about figure skating?

05:16.008 --> 05:18.141
My partner Heidi Shatsky and I
were Twin Cities.

05:18.152 --> 05:20.644
Junior Pairs Champions
three years running.

05:32.649 --> 05:34.460
I always thought
you were a hockey player, Cap.

05:34.484 --> 05:36.118
Who says you can't do both?

05:44.846 --> 05:46.846
We'll Google for photos later.

My lucky night.

07:06.335 --> 07:08.721
Yeah, a lot of people
bet against you.

07:08.745 --> 07:10.932
Nobody expected you to take
the big guy out so quick.

07:10.956 --> 07:12.881
Tap out or knock out,
your rules.

07:12.958 --> 07:16.435
- Hm.
- Hey, when can I come back?

07:16.512 --> 07:18.437
You like that, huh?

07:18.514 --> 07:21.223
Doesn't hurt.

07:21.299 --> 07:24.434
Friend of mine told me
I needed to find an outlet.

07:24.445 --> 07:27.604
- I think I found it.
- Yeah, nice.

07:27.615 --> 07:29.742
You're looking to blow off
some steam on Friday night,

07:29.766 --> 07:32.776
I'll put you on the undercard.

07:32.787 --> 07:34.620
Good.

07:34.697 --> 07:36.947
- Finally.
- Hey.

07:36.958 --> 07:39.177
Tap out or knockout,
works both ways.

07:39.201 --> 07:41.460
Yeah.

07:41.578 --> 07:43.212
See you soon.

07:59.888 --> 08:04.099
Whoo. Nice truck.

08:04.176 --> 08:05.767
Is it a rental?

08:05.844 --> 08:09.146
Nope. All mine.

08:09.156 --> 08:13.066
I... I didn't know
you were getting a new ride.

08:13.143 --> 08:16.236
Yeah, well,
AC crapped out on the old one.

08:16.313 --> 08:19.614
Again. Christopher and I
were sitting in traffic,

08:19.691 --> 08:21.500
sweating in traffic.

08:21.577 --> 08:23.335
Saw this dealership.
Thought, why not?

08:23.412 --> 08:26.621
A total impulse buy.

08:26.698 --> 08:27.978
Not like you at all.

08:28.033 --> 08:29.341
Maybe it should be.

08:29.418 --> 08:31.168
Well, I'll remind you of that
next time

08:31.178 --> 08:33.538
you're begging for extra shifts
to cover the payments.

08:35.424 --> 08:38.183
- What's this?
- This...

08:38.260 --> 08:40.802
This is epic.

08:40.879 --> 08:42.270
I found Heidi Shatsky.

08:45.383 --> 08:47.100
Morning, folks.

08:47.177 --> 08:48.821
First up, water heater went out
last night,

08:48.845 --> 08:50.749
but they are sending someone
to fix it.

08:50.773 --> 08:52.022
Until then, you might wanna
brace yourselves

08:52.033 --> 08:53.866
when you hit the showers.

08:53.942 --> 08:56.022
We're also changing
the lunch schedule.

09:01.191 --> 09:03.492
Captain Robert Nash...

09:03.568 --> 09:05.118
this is your life!

09:05.195 --> 09:07.557
Oh, my gosh.
Where did you get that?

09:07.581 --> 09:09.289
- Heidi says hi.
- Aw.

09:09.366 --> 09:10.290
She's gonna email you later.

09:10.367 --> 09:12.053
She didn't wanna
ruin the surprise.

09:12.077 --> 09:13.721
I think we all had
a little surprise this morning.

09:13.745 --> 09:15.295
Not sure what I was expecting,

09:15.372 --> 09:18.173
but it certainly wasn't
that hair!

09:18.250 --> 09:19.382
Yeah, Cap, what is this look?

09:19.393 --> 09:21.062
Is it some kind
of Travolta thing.

09:21.086 --> 09:23.479
Not Travolta. Bowie.

09:25.590 --> 09:26.973
Ziggy Stardust?

09:27.050 --> 09:30.235
This feels a little more
Siegfried and Roy.

09:30.312 --> 09:33.021
Sorry I'm late.
I had to take Denny to school.

09:33.098 --> 09:36.116
What did I miss?

09:37.394 --> 09:40.079
Okay, for everyone
who isn't fired,

09:40.155 --> 09:41.404
I will not be cooking today.

09:41.415 --> 09:43.490
We're having
a special guest chef at lunch.

09:43.567 --> 09:45.659
Uh, no pasta Thursday?

09:45.735 --> 09:47.419
Not today.

10:00.250 --> 10:03.051
Do not touch that pot.

10:03.128 --> 10:04.261
Okay, now I got two of you

10:04.271 --> 10:05.679
hovering over me
when I'm cooking.

10:05.755 --> 10:06.899
I'm not hovering.
I'm just here to help out.

10:06.923 --> 10:08.223
Could you find me a skillet?

10:08.300 --> 10:10.609
Will do.

10:10.686 --> 10:12.102
You didn't have to do all this.

10:12.113 --> 10:14.688
No, I needed to do something.

10:14.764 --> 10:16.231
I cleared out every closet,

10:16.308 --> 10:18.024
brought 16 bags to Goodwill.

10:18.101 --> 10:19.776
Yesterday, I even started

10:19.787 --> 10:21.778
organizing our receipts
for the accountant.

10:21.789 --> 10:23.583
- It's November.
- Exactly.

10:23.607 --> 10:25.958
I need the suspension
to be over with

10:26.034 --> 10:29.494
before I start
redecorating the damn house.

10:29.571 --> 10:32.297
Okay.

10:32.374 --> 10:34.466
You want me to try those beans?

10:34.543 --> 10:37.127
Mmm, yes.

10:37.138 --> 10:38.778
- How's that?
- Good.

10:43.460 --> 10:44.885
I still think it's ridiculous

10:44.961 --> 10:46.970
you got suspended
for solving a murder.

10:46.981 --> 10:49.648
But I might get over that
if you keep bringing us food.

10:49.725 --> 10:51.817
Well, the brisket
is my special recipe.

10:51.894 --> 10:54.644
You just smoke it
low and slow for 14 hours.

10:54.655 --> 10:56.321
And then you turn it...

10:58.850 --> 11:00.817
Mm.

11:00.828 --> 11:02.652
Mm.

11:02.663 --> 11:03.831
She's been cooking at home too.

11:03.855 --> 11:05.405
Every meal's been a feast.

11:05.482 --> 11:07.722
Have you ever considered
being suspended forever?

11:09.027 --> 11:13.288
Not that your cooking
isn't good, Cap.

11:13.365 --> 11:16.333
Well, I like
both your food equally.

11:16.343 --> 11:18.627
Oh, I'm not liking it.
I'm loving it.

11:18.703 --> 11:19.983
So when I go back for seconds,

11:20.038 --> 11:22.598
y'all better watch your fingers.

11:26.336 --> 11:29.679
Cheryl?

11:29.690 --> 11:31.273
No, I'm at work.

11:33.435 --> 11:36.320
I'm so sorry. I thought
Karen was gonna call you.

11:39.516 --> 11:40.774
<i>What's that?</i>

11:40.850 --> 11:42.370
<i>You're breaking up on me.
Are you driving?</i>

11:42.394 --> 11:44.152
Well, honey,
it's a self-driving car,

11:44.229 --> 11:45.831
so technically
the car is driving.

11:45.855 --> 11:47.614
<i>I don't trust that technology.</i>

11:47.691 --> 11:49.366
<i>At least tell me you still
have your hands on the wheel.</i>

11:49.376 --> 11:50.951
Totally hands-free.

11:51.027 --> 11:53.712
Feet-free too.
You know, I can text,

11:53.789 --> 11:55.675
eat a sandwich,
watch a movie in here,

11:55.699 --> 11:57.268
- all at the same time.
<i>- That is not safe.</i>

11:57.292 --> 11:59.960
Guess what I'm doing now?
The Macarena.

12:00.036 --> 12:01.711
<i>Okay, if you're
gonna keep messing with me,</i>

12:01.722 --> 12:03.713
<i>I'm hanging up.</i>

12:03.748 --> 12:05.840
Ooh. Ahh.

12:05.917 --> 12:07.801
<i>What happened?</i>
Uhh-

12:07.877 --> 12:11.230
Uh, uh, something's wrong.
Ooh.

12:11.306 --> 12:14.399
My chest hurts. Uh...

12:14.476 --> 12:17.352
<i>What?
Can you pull over?</i>

12:17.429 --> 12:20.563
No, no I got this.

12:20.574 --> 12:21.856
<i>Please select</i>

12:21.933 --> 12:23.244
<i>- new route.</i>
- Ahh.

12:23.268 --> 12:25.077
<i>Calculating new route.</i>

12:25.153 --> 12:27.404
<i>Starting route.</i>

12:27.414 --> 12:28.705
<i>To Mercy King Hospital.</i>

12:44.265 --> 12:46.431
<i>You have arrived
at your destination.</i>

12:53.923 --> 12:55.682
- Okay, watch his arm.
- Yeah, got it, Cap.

12:55.759 --> 12:58.226
Three, two, one, up.

12:58.303 --> 13:04.065
Oh, here we go. Oh.

13:04.142 --> 13:05.951
Let's get him up to cardiology.

13:09.865 --> 13:11.906
I feel redundant.

13:11.983 --> 13:13.867
I'm not sure why
we're even here.

13:13.943 --> 13:15.952
Okay, let's get
that fender sorted out

13:15.963 --> 13:17.620
so we can move this thing.

13:21.493 --> 13:23.543
You hanging in there, Doc?

13:23.620 --> 13:26.638
Just a couple fractured ribs.
Maybe multiple places.

13:26.715 --> 13:27.859
Can you tell if you're bleeding?

13:27.883 --> 13:30.443
Just some blunt force trauma.
Yay.

13:45.517 --> 13:47.659
One, two, three.

13:54.001 --> 13:56.126
She's all yours.

14:07.205 --> 14:09.631
Denny, what's wrong?
Everything okay?

14:15.097 --> 14:16.646
Karen?

14:21.010 --> 14:24.270
Hey. Dinner's ready.
Are you gonna eat with us?

14:24.347 --> 14:26.815
I told you
I wasn't feeling well.

14:26.891 --> 14:30.819
Why don't you get up?
I'm worried about you.

14:30.895 --> 14:33.029
I know that you're...
You're still upset.

14:33.040 --> 14:34.539
Still?

14:40.455 --> 14:44.049
It's been three weeks.

14:44.126 --> 14:47.043
I'm sorry my grief
is taking so long.

14:47.054 --> 14:50.672
What would be an acceptable
amount of time for me to mourn?

14:50.748 --> 14:52.132
I mean, we lost six embryos.

14:52.208 --> 14:53.686
I mean, is it just a day
for each one?

14:53.710 --> 14:56.052
Or can I negotiate
for a little more time

14:56.063 --> 14:58.847
to process my loss?

14:58.923 --> 15:01.057
Why am I the only one
that's feeling it?

15:01.068 --> 15:03.309
Mommy,
I know you're not feeling well,

15:03.386 --> 15:04.727
so I made you some tea.

15:06.598 --> 15:08.857
No, not right now, Denny.

15:08.933 --> 15:10.191
- D-D-Denny... Hold on...
- Oh!

15:10.268 --> 15:12.569
Denny! Damn it!
Sweet-honey...

15:12.579 --> 15:15.155
Ugh! Now I have to
change the sheets.

15:15.231 --> 15:17.249
I'm sorry.

15:17.325 --> 15:20.618
No.

15:20.695 --> 15:22.587
No, I'm sorry.
Come here.

15:22.664 --> 15:25.415
I'm sorry, baby.

15:25.426 --> 15:27.834
I shouldn't have
yelled like that.

15:27.911 --> 15:29.669
Thank you so much
for bringing me the tea.

15:29.746 --> 15:31.596
That was very thoughtful.

15:31.673 --> 15:33.339
Here, honey, why don't...

15:33.416 --> 15:35.561
Why don't you bring this cup
back to the kitchen.

15:35.585 --> 15:38.344
Careful.

15:38.421 --> 15:40.825
Mom and I will be out
in a minute,

15:40.849 --> 15:42.182
and we can all have dinner.

15:42.258 --> 15:45.185
- Together?
- Yes, together.

15:45.261 --> 15:47.946
And you can tell me
all about your day.

15:54.029 --> 15:58.874
Karen, you're not the only one
feeling the loss.

16:00.818 --> 16:05.747
I... I don't know
how to do what you do, Hen.

16:05.823 --> 16:09.634
How to just put it away.

16:14.332 --> 16:17.684
I haven't put anything away.

16:19.128 --> 16:21.646
I'm sad, too.

16:23.041 --> 16:26.443
I got really attached
to the idea of a new baby.

16:27.654 --> 16:30.230
Oh.

16:30.306 --> 16:33.316
I guess maybe that's
the difference.

16:33.327 --> 16:35.994
Those embryos were just
an idea to you.

16:39.166 --> 16:43.293
But each one of them
was actually a part of me.

16:52.662 --> 16:53.806
I really wish I could help her,

16:53.830 --> 16:55.307
but she's not talking
to me about it.

16:55.331 --> 16:57.017
I'm not sure she's talking
to anybody.

16:57.041 --> 16:59.425
There's definitely something
going on with her.

16:59.502 --> 17:03.012
Eddie, too. Hey, you guys think
it's the Santa Anas?

17:03.047 --> 17:04.817
I mean, they... they make people
act weird, right?

17:04.840 --> 17:08.518
I definitely
don't think it's the wind.

17:08.529 --> 17:10.353
Wait, you know what?
Maybe it's something personal

17:10.364 --> 17:11.695
she doesn't feel like sharing.

17:11.772 --> 17:13.031
Well, historically speaking,

17:13.108 --> 17:15.191
Hen and I tell each other
everything.

17:15.202 --> 17:17.193
Wait, everything?

17:17.204 --> 17:20.946
- Did you tell her about me?
- No. I mean, I would have

17:21.023 --> 17:21.823
if I felt like
she was listening.

17:21.898 --> 17:23.616
Oh.

17:23.693 --> 17:25.785
Maddie, you know
she's my best friend.

17:25.862 --> 17:27.631
- I need to talk to someone.
- I-I know.

17:27.655 --> 17:30.206
It's just, you tell her,
she tells Buck.

17:30.217 --> 17:31.708
I mean, maybe everything
doesn't need to be shared

17:31.718 --> 17:34.711
- with the 118.
- No way.

17:34.721 --> 17:36.838
If we didn't tell each other
everything,

17:36.914 --> 17:39.882
what else would we do
on a 24-hour shift?

17:39.917 --> 17:41.186
Yeah.

17:41.210 --> 17:43.219
Okay.

17:43.230 --> 17:45.221
- Hey, you don't have to.
- It's fine.

17:45.232 --> 17:48.057
Uh, I am back in therapy.

17:48.068 --> 17:50.852
Uh, mandated by my boss
this time.

17:50.928 --> 17:54.564
Uh, did... did something happen
at work?

17:54.575 --> 17:57.742
A woman filed a complaint
against me.

17:57.819 --> 18:00.528
She said I was stalking her.

18:00.605 --> 18:04.073
I think stalking
is an overstatement.

18:04.084 --> 18:07.460
But... it's true?

18:08.830 --> 18:10.747
This woman called 9-1-1,

18:10.757 --> 18:12.757
and Maddie thought
she was in trouble,

18:12.834 --> 18:14.167
so she just tried to help her.

18:14.243 --> 18:15.479
Yeah,
but she didn't want my help

18:15.503 --> 18:16.764
because she thinks
I'm a crazy person

18:16.788 --> 18:19.213
who invaded her privacy.

18:19.290 --> 18:22.183
Maybe there's a lesson
in there for the two of you.

18:25.254 --> 18:27.814

going on with Eddie?

Hey, hey, hey.
Can you hear me?

19:21.328 --> 19:23.455
- What the hell's going on?
- He's not breathing.

19:23.479 --> 19:25.738
- Call 9-1-1!
- Are you crazy?

19:25.815 --> 19:27.668
I'm not calling anyone.
Yeah, he'll be fine.

19:27.692 --> 19:28.950
His airway's blocked.

19:40.872 --> 19:43.756
- What the hell's that?
- Part of his nose...

19:43.833 --> 19:45.352
that I knocked into
his cranial cavity

19:45.376 --> 19:48.010
when I broke it
before it fell down his throat.

19:48.021 --> 19:49.512
He's gonna start
leaking spinal fluid.

19:49.523 --> 19:51.398
Holy crap. Is he dead?

19:54.177 --> 19:55.193
Hey, give that back!

19:55.270 --> 19:56.363
No, no, no. Don't do it.

19:56.387 --> 19:58.321
Don't do it!

20:04.596 --> 20:06.863
Hurry, get out of here.

20:06.873 --> 20:07.706
Let's go, let's go.

20:07.782 --> 20:09.490
Clear a path.

20:09.567 --> 20:11.487
Fire department, coming through.

20:14.381 --> 20:15.880
Man down over there, Cap.

20:15.957 --> 20:18.883
All right, what do we got here?
Let's see.

20:18.960 --> 20:20.846
Gonna hook him up to
the LifePack, check his rhythm.

20:20.870 --> 20:23.054
Airway's clear.

20:23.131 --> 20:24.505
It could be a cranial intrusion.

20:24.582 --> 20:27.633
Let's check for spinal fluid.

20:27.710 --> 20:30.803
No sign of neck injury,
but his pulse is a little low.

20:30.880 --> 20:33.347
That's part of his nose.

20:33.424 --> 20:37.727
Someone cleared it
and sat him upright.

20:37.738 --> 20:40.354
Looks like somebody
knew what they were doing.

20:45.937 --> 20:47.080
So are you the one who saved him

20:47.104 --> 20:49.581
or the one who
almost killed him?

20:49.657 --> 20:52.250
- Both.
- What the hell, Eddie?

20:52.327 --> 20:54.887
Can we talk about this later?
I need to go before...

20:57.257 --> 20:59.048
The police show up?

21:00.427 --> 21:02.260
What are you doing?

21:02.337 --> 21:03.544
Saving myself the trouble

21:03.621 --> 21:05.213
of having to bail you
out of jail again.

21:05.289 --> 21:07.098
Put this on
until the cops leave.

21:09.511 --> 21:11.436
<i>We obtained several people.</i>

21:11.513 --> 21:14.222
<i>Still some on foot.
Please be advised.</i>

21:14.298 --> 21:15.899
<i>Still some on foot.</i>

21:18.636 --> 21:20.520
Thanks.

21:20.596 --> 21:21.782
Let me know what hospital
you guys drop him off at.

21:21.806 --> 21:24.565
I'll... I'll make sure he's okay.

21:24.642 --> 21:26.901
You knocked his nose
into his brain. He ain't okay.

21:26.978 --> 21:30.121
Look, I did my best to help him.

21:30.198 --> 21:31.697
I'm the one who called 9-1-1.

21:31.774 --> 21:34.242
How long you been fighting here?

21:34.318 --> 21:36.129
Promoter saw me
at the junkyard fights

21:36.153 --> 21:40.298
a few weeks ago,
offered me a shot.

21:40.375 --> 21:42.300
Pays pretty good.

21:42.377 --> 21:44.544
That's not why
you're doing this.

21:44.620 --> 21:46.462
Fighting was supposed to be
a healthy outlet,

21:46.473 --> 21:48.807
- not an obsession.
- It's not.

21:48.883 --> 21:51.050
- Just got out of hand tonight.
- I bet.

21:51.127 --> 21:53.636
Tell me, that hit to the nose,
was that a lucky shot?

21:53.647 --> 21:55.313
Or had he dropped his hands?

21:55.390 --> 21:58.474
Tap out or knock out.
Those are the rules.

21:58.485 --> 22:00.768
- He didn't tap out.
- He was so punch drunk,

22:00.845 --> 22:02.281
he couldn't even lift his hands
to protect himself.

22:02.305 --> 22:03.229
You think he should've had

22:03.306 --> 22:05.147
the presence of mind to tap out?

22:05.158 --> 22:08.234
Eddie, you need
to talk to someone.

22:08.311 --> 22:10.497
You know what?
Just save the lecture.

22:10.521 --> 22:13.072
Bosko.

22:13.149 --> 22:16.450
- We're heading out.
- Coming, Cap.

22:16.527 --> 22:17.671
We're not done
talking about this.

22:17.695 --> 22:19.128
Yeah.

22:44.680 --> 22:46.898
It's quiet around here.
Where is everybody?

22:46.974 --> 22:50.610
Oh, Bobby found an ice rink
in Van Nuys.

22:50.686 --> 22:52.653
He wanted to teach
May and Harry how to skate.

22:56.859 --> 22:59.285
I can't believe you didn't go.

22:59.362 --> 23:01.048
You didn't wanna see
Bobby's ice dancing moves?

23:01.072 --> 23:03.998
Girl, I am not interested
in any athletic activity

23:04.075 --> 23:06.959
that requires a parka.

23:07.036 --> 23:09.554
May and Harry seemed to be
excited about it, though.

23:09.631 --> 23:11.464
Though probably not as much
as Bobby.

23:11.540 --> 23:13.057
Mm.

23:13.134 --> 23:15.551
It must be nice for him.

23:15.562 --> 23:18.471
He's finally having his first
with Harry and May.

23:18.547 --> 23:21.182
- Mm.
- Teaching them something new.

23:21.258 --> 23:25.478
That's nice.

23:25.554 --> 23:28.522
So what's going on with you?

23:28.599 --> 23:32.068
I heard about what happened
with the IVF.

23:36.107 --> 23:38.210
Chimney told Bobby,
and Bobby told you.

23:38.234 --> 23:41.702
I wish you had told me yourself.

23:41.779 --> 23:43.974
You had so much
on your plate, Athena.

23:43.998 --> 23:48.751
There is always room for you.

23:48.762 --> 23:52.430
Truthfully, I thought
we would've gotten through it.

23:52.507 --> 23:54.434
I mean, the day we got the news,

23:54.458 --> 23:59.270
we got in bed together,
and we... we held each other.

23:59.347 --> 24:01.263
We cried.

24:01.274 --> 24:04.850
And we grieved.

24:04.927 --> 24:09.522
But then at some point,
I got up...

24:09.598 --> 24:11.243
but she's still laying
in the bed.

24:11.267 --> 24:13.901
Mm.

24:13.978 --> 24:17.363
I mean, I see her struggling,
and you know...

24:17.440 --> 24:20.032
And I know it's true
and you know...

24:20.109 --> 24:22.587
And I... I know she's not
trying to spite me,

24:22.611 --> 24:25.149
but it's just... there's just
a part of me that...

24:25.173 --> 24:26.714
You're angry with her.

24:28.710 --> 24:32.303
And I don't wanna be.

24:32.380 --> 24:34.305
I hate that I am.

24:35.976 --> 24:38.884
But I... I come home,
Athena, and...

24:38.961 --> 24:41.053
the house is a mess,

24:41.130 --> 24:43.608
and... and Denny's parked
in front of that television,

24:43.632 --> 24:45.266
and he hasn't eaten anything

24:45.342 --> 24:48.769
that... that doesn't come out
of a box or a bag,

24:48.846 --> 24:50.146
And I... and I just... I just...

24:50.156 --> 24:53.649
I wanna... I wanna scream at her.

24:53.660 --> 24:55.985
We're still here!

24:55.996 --> 24:59.238
Your actual living,
breathing son

24:59.315 --> 25:02.667
and... and your wife... we're here!

25:02.744 --> 25:04.502
And we need you!

25:08.508 --> 25:10.194
I feel like
such a terrible person

25:10.218 --> 25:12.051
for saying that out loud.

25:13.921 --> 25:16.172
But you're not.

25:16.182 --> 25:18.966
You haven't said
any of this to her.

25:19.043 --> 25:20.518
You're saying it to me.

25:20.595 --> 25:22.595
Hm?

25:22.671 --> 25:25.306
Because you are worried,
frustrated

25:25.382 --> 25:29.027
- and frankly, exhausted.
- And I'm scared.

25:32.440 --> 25:35.316
Karen will come back to you.

25:35.392 --> 25:40.955
But until then, you got me. Hm?

25:53.553 --> 25:55.961
Diaz, up here, now.

25:56.038 --> 25:57.046
I was gonna go change.

25:57.057 --> 25:59.223
No, we talk first.

26:05.398 --> 26:06.514
What are you doing here?

26:06.590 --> 26:09.016
Just talk to your captain.

26:09.093 --> 26:13.071
Did you tell him?
You sold me out, huh?

26:13.147 --> 26:15.648
I thought we were friends.

26:15.724 --> 26:18.859
What's the name of my cat?

26:18.936 --> 26:21.496
I know about your kid
and your dead wife

26:21.564 --> 26:25.416
and your arrest record
and the guy you almost killed.

26:25.493 --> 26:28.994
So tell me,
what's the name of my cat?

26:29.071 --> 26:30.830
I have no freakin' idea.

26:30.906 --> 26:32.256
Exactly.

26:32.333 --> 26:35.209
It's a one-way street
with you, Diaz.

26:35.286 --> 26:36.928
We're not friends.

26:38.932 --> 26:43.017
And for the record,
I don't have a cat.

26:47.089 --> 26:48.889
Look, Cap, I don't know
what Bosko told you...

26:48.924 --> 26:51.278
Captain Cooper
called me last night.

26:51.302 --> 26:52.737
He recognized you
from the tsunami.

26:52.761 --> 26:54.270
He wanted to give me a heads up

26:54.280 --> 26:56.605
about a potential problem
in my house.

26:56.616 --> 26:57.909
- But Lena...
- She was here

26:57.933 --> 26:59.900
when I pulled in this morning.

26:59.977 --> 27:01.505
Wanted to make sure
I had a full picture

27:01.529 --> 27:04.089
and that I wasn't
too hard on you.

27:06.200 --> 27:08.793
- Guess I owe her an apology.
- Take a seat.

27:14.300 --> 27:18.210
It's nothing. It's...
I'm fine.

27:18.287 --> 27:20.638
Just needed a place
to let off some steam.

27:20.715 --> 27:23.808
- Things got a little out of...
- Control?

27:23.885 --> 27:26.135
That's what this is about,
right?

27:26.146 --> 27:27.469
You're the guy who always
keeps it together,

27:27.480 --> 27:29.305
no matter what life
throws at you.

27:29.315 --> 27:32.433
You shake it off,
keep moving forward.

27:32.509 --> 27:33.976
Lots of people have it worse.

27:33.987 --> 27:35.322
Eddie, I just wanna make sure
you don't think

27:35.346 --> 27:38.772
you have to lose everything...

27:38.849 --> 27:40.327
before you can allow yourself
to feel anything.

27:43.854 --> 27:46.831
No, Christopher needs me
to be in control.

27:46.908 --> 27:48.335
I'm the only parent
he's got left,

27:48.359 --> 27:49.742
and I can't let him down again.

27:49.818 --> 27:51.671
When did you let him down
before?

27:51.695 --> 27:55.414
God,
when did I not let him down?

27:55.491 --> 27:58.209
I wasn't there
when he was a baby.

27:58.285 --> 28:01.679
Stayed away too long,
and it broke his mother.

28:01.756 --> 28:04.506
Shannon ran away, I...
And I couldn't stop her.

28:04.517 --> 28:06.383
I couldn't bring her back home.

28:06.460 --> 28:08.969
So I brought him here.

28:09.046 --> 28:10.471
And let her back into his life.

28:10.547 --> 28:11.680
That's what Christopher wanted.

28:11.691 --> 28:14.433
Yeah, but... but I knew better.

28:14.510 --> 28:16.030
She already left once,
broke his heart.

28:18.722 --> 28:21.157
You know, I was so afraid
she was gonna do it again.

28:25.229 --> 28:27.488
- She did.
- She died, Eddie.

28:27.564 --> 28:31.992
Yeah, after she told me
she wanted...

28:32.069 --> 28:34.086
a divorce.

28:39.076 --> 28:41.886
And I'm...

28:41.963 --> 28:43.337
I'm still mad.

28:43.414 --> 28:46.215
How stupid is that?

28:46.226 --> 28:48.842
I'm angry at a dead person
and at myself

28:48.919 --> 28:52.721
because I forgave her...

28:52.732 --> 28:55.233
for everything, and...

28:55.309 --> 28:58.352
And it wasn't enough.

28:58.429 --> 29:01.072
I wasn't enough.

29:12.660 --> 29:14.868
All right, listen up.

29:14.945 --> 29:16.423
The speed and efficiency
is total crap lately.

29:16.447 --> 29:17.913
How bad does it suck?

29:17.924 --> 29:20.541
An average of 15 seconds
too long to find each item.

29:20.617 --> 29:21.857
Customers shop with us online

29:21.910 --> 29:23.555
because they want
their stuff fast.

29:23.579 --> 29:26.338
You slow pokes
can't keep up with the bots.

29:26.415 --> 29:28.590
Because of that, I'm canceling
all bathroom breaks

29:28.601 --> 29:30.268
until further notice.

29:30.344 --> 29:31.593
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

29:31.604 --> 29:33.012
We've already wasted
a minute here

29:33.088 --> 29:34.324
because we had to stop
and have this chat.

29:34.348 --> 29:37.016
So my suggestion is
quit your whining

29:37.092 --> 29:38.278
and go light a fire under it.

29:38.302 --> 29:40.686
Now!

29:48.454 --> 29:50.123
- Are you okay?
- No, I really have to

29:50.147 --> 29:51.947
go to the bathroom.

29:51.958 --> 29:53.084
I think I gotta sneak in there.

29:53.108 --> 29:55.534
Don't do it;
It'll ruin your pick-time.

29:55.611 --> 29:57.255
Yes, of course it will,
but our pick-time

29:57.279 --> 29:59.288
is supposed to include
pee-pee-time. It's the law.

29:59.299 --> 30:01.184
Yeah, well, the law
doesn't apply to the robots.

30:01.208 --> 30:02.427
They don't take breaks.

30:02.451 --> 30:03.687
They're already self-aware.

30:03.711 --> 30:05.597
You know,
sometimes I hate this dumb job.

30:05.621 --> 30:06.806
You know, I heard a rumor
that Shane is gonna fire

30:06.830 --> 30:07.638
the slowest picker
from this shift,

30:07.715 --> 30:08.975
and I need this dumb job.

30:08.999 --> 30:10.975
Mm, God, he's still over there.

30:11.052 --> 30:13.612
I'm already a minute behind.
I gotta go.

30:53.710 --> 30:55.344
Oh, I'm fired.

31:00.193 --> 31:02.351
Self-driving cars,

31:02.362 --> 31:05.604
smart homes, robot labor.

31:05.681 --> 31:07.022
I'm telling you, Hen,
the future is here

31:07.033 --> 31:08.824
and it is terrifying.

31:10.778 --> 31:13.195
Hen!

31:13.206 --> 31:15.781
I'm so... I'm sorry, Chim.
I'm...

31:15.858 --> 31:17.157
I'm just a little distracted.

31:17.234 --> 31:19.493
Look, I know.
And I'm sorry.

31:19.570 --> 31:21.295
But I can't do this without you.

31:23.198 --> 31:24.498
I need my partner back.

31:30.414 --> 31:31.797
I'm here. I'm with you.

31:31.874 --> 31:34.007
Good.

31:34.084 --> 31:35.717
Let's go put down
this robot revolution.

31:35.728 --> 31:40.639
Hey, not all automation is bad.

31:40.716 --> 31:43.392
Nice!

31:43.403 --> 31:45.069
Robot number three
just went crazy.

31:45.146 --> 31:46.562
What kinda robot
are we talking about?

31:46.572 --> 31:48.063
Uh, transport. The company has
a whole army of them.

31:48.074 --> 31:49.459
And they're used for moving
heavy boxes

31:49.483 --> 31:50.743
and shelved items
around the warehouse.

31:50.767 --> 31:51.962
And it attacked someone?

31:51.986 --> 31:53.244
Yeah, my co-worker Jerome.

31:53.320 --> 31:54.736
Uh, I heard that it just
beelined for him

31:54.747 --> 31:55.863
like a suicide bomber

31:55.939 --> 31:57.041
and crashed into
the end of the aisle

31:57.065 --> 31:57.772
then took down
a whole row of shelves.

31:57.774 --> 31:59.250
I miss brick-and-mortar.

31:59.326 --> 32:01.368
Any idea what caused
the robot to malfunction?

32:01.445 --> 32:03.306
Uh, normally, their movements
are really precise.

32:03.330 --> 32:04.413
It's just that, uh, number three

32:04.424 --> 32:05.831
was just gunning for Jerome.

32:05.908 --> 32:07.258
Okay, you guys can clear away.

32:07.334 --> 32:09.543
We'll take over from here.
Step back, please.

32:13.433 --> 32:15.757
Hi, Jerome. Are you having
any trouble breathing?

32:15.768 --> 32:17.843
- No.
- Obvious crush injuries.

32:17.920 --> 32:20.262
Don't know the condition
of his extremities under there.

32:20.273 --> 32:21.608
All I wanted was to take a leak.

32:21.632 --> 32:23.599
It's a basic human need.

32:23.609 --> 32:25.695
Uh, did... did you pee on this
before it crashed?

32:25.719 --> 32:27.519
Why would you do that?

32:27.596 --> 32:30.281
Our supervisor won't let us
go to the bathroom.

32:30.357 --> 32:31.773
It ruins our pick-time.

32:31.784 --> 32:33.119
Yeah, according to
our supervisor, Shane...

32:33.143 --> 32:35.119
Where is Shane?

32:35.196 --> 32:36.361
Don't go anywhere, Shane.

32:36.438 --> 32:37.958
OSHA's gonna have
a field day with you.

32:38.032 --> 32:40.365
Cap, heart's racing,

32:40.442 --> 32:42.086
blood pressure's a little low
and not a lot of blood.

32:42.110 --> 32:43.519
- I'm gonna start a line.
- It could be

32:43.521 --> 32:46.747
something severed underneath
but currently compressed.

32:46.823 --> 32:48.801
- Ready for either extremity.
- Okay, Buck, you're with me.

32:48.825 --> 32:50.250
Eddie, take the side on his arm.

32:50.327 --> 32:51.429
- You got it, Cap.
- We need to lift

32:51.453 --> 32:53.879
the shelving unit
at exactly the same time

32:53.956 --> 32:55.714
so they can work on him
simultaneously.

32:55.791 --> 32:57.549
On three.
One, two, three.

33:00.963 --> 33:02.137
I've got brachial.

33:02.148 --> 33:04.097
- Taking femoral.
- I can hardly see

33:04.174 --> 33:05.535
the artery;
It's recoiling back up.

33:05.559 --> 33:07.935
Applying clamp and tourniquet.

33:08.011 --> 33:10.131
Eddie, can you hold
his shoulders, please?

33:13.684 --> 33:16.401
I should've just wet my pants.
Ah, ah, ah.

33:16.478 --> 33:17.328
- Got it.
- Damn it.

33:17.404 --> 33:19.154
Hen, I need another...

33:33.754 --> 33:35.634
Lost his pulse.
He's crashing.

33:39.167 --> 33:40.842
Run the line wide open.

33:47.026 --> 33:48.692
We got him!

33:50.679 --> 33:53.981
Cap, he's stable enough
to transport.

33:55.868 --> 33:58.619
Great work today, guys.
She is back!

34:00.540 --> 34:02.208
All right, you get him
to the hospital.

34:02.232 --> 34:03.040
I'll see you
back at the station.

34:03.117 --> 34:05.367
Sure thing, Cap.

34:09.864 --> 34:12.382
Maybe they'll put a
catheter in me at the hospital,

34:12.458 --> 34:16.219
and then I'll be able
to go to the bathroom

34:16.255 --> 34:19.056
any time I damn well please.

34:19.132 --> 34:22.009
Jerome is joking about
wanting a catheter, Hen.

34:22.085 --> 34:24.344
I think he may have
a head injury.

34:24.397 --> 34:26.638
- Tell him to hold on.
- Almost there, buddy.

34:37.635 --> 34:40.027
Hey, let me give you
a preview of tonight, Gram.

34:40.103 --> 34:41.320
I know you'll love it.

34:41.396 --> 34:44.248
Gotta say,
I feel completely vindicated

34:44.324 --> 34:47.751
backing your decision
to quit the piano at age nine.

34:47.828 --> 34:51.255
It is so fun telling
your parents, "I told you so."

34:51.331 --> 34:52.539
I'd take all the credit,

34:52.616 --> 34:54.507
but I know you were
the OG, Gran.

34:56.003 --> 34:59.546
I hate that I can't be there
for your Philharmonic debut.

34:59.623 --> 35:03.508
Youngest soloist
in L.A. Orchestra history.

35:03.585 --> 35:05.594
I mean, this is pretty much

35:05.605 --> 35:08.606
the pinnacle of stuff
a grandma lives for.

35:08.682 --> 35:13.435
And you've never
missed a performance yet, so...

35:13.446 --> 35:15.446
it won't be the same
without you.

35:58.974 --> 36:01.274
Hey, Mom.
I'm leaving Gran's house now

36:01.351 --> 36:04.161
to go pick up my dress
at the cleaners.

36:04.238 --> 36:06.613
No, I won't be late.

36:30.797 --> 36:32.431
- Hi, Mom.
<i>- Hi, honey.</i>

36:32.507 --> 36:34.850
<i>I'm just calling again to make
sure you have your heels.</i>

36:34.860 --> 36:36.487
Stop fussing. You'd think
you were the one

36:36.511 --> 36:38.529
- giving the performance.
<i>- You think I'm bad?</i>

36:38.605 --> 36:40.583
<i>Your father
changed his shirt again.</i>

36:40.607 --> 36:41.918
<i>- He's driving me crazy.
- I heard that.</i>

36:41.942 --> 36:45.035
Go help him. I'm good.

36:45.112 --> 36:47.988
<i>We're so proud of you,
honey. Bye.</i>

37:32.108 --> 37:33.250
Ah.

37:36.363 --> 37:38.922
Ah. Hen, what happened?

37:38.999 --> 37:40.718
I-I hit a car
in the intersection.

37:40.742 --> 37:42.645
- There's a girl in it.
- I'll call for more units.

37:42.669 --> 37:44.889
We have to get Jerome
to the hospital.

37:44.913 --> 37:46.880
Ma'am, can you hear me?

37:46.957 --> 37:48.932
Ma'am?

37:49.009 --> 37:51.769
Evelyn. Evelyn!
Evelyn, can you hear me?

37:51.845 --> 37:53.428
Ma'am, if you...
If you can't lift your head,

37:53.439 --> 37:55.325
can you move your fingers
if you can hear me?

37:55.349 --> 37:57.274
<i>Dispatch, this is ambulance 118.</i>

37:57.351 --> 37:58.892
<i>We've hit a civilian vehicle</i>

37:58.969 --> 38:00.435
<i>at the intersection
of West Olympic and Main.</i>

38:00.446 --> 38:01.603
<i>The vehicle driver is injured.</i>

38:01.614 --> 38:03.522
<i>Request assistance ASAP.</i>

38:03.598 --> 38:05.232
Dispatch, this is Captain 118.

38:05.308 --> 38:07.504
We are en route to the scene
at West Olympic and Main.

38:07.528 --> 38:09.194
<i>We also need
an additional RA unit</i>

38:09.271 --> 38:10.570
<i>to transport our passenger.</i>

38:10.647 --> 38:11.863
<i>Copy that, 118.</i>

38:11.940 --> 38:13.251
Cap, who was driving
the ambulance?

38:13.275 --> 38:15.450
Hen.

38:25.453 --> 38:27.587
Evelyn!

38:27.664 --> 38:29.025
- Here, let me get it.
- Evelyn,

38:29.049 --> 38:30.298
we're not gonna leave you, okay?

38:30.309 --> 38:31.967
- Jerome?
- Still stable.

38:31.977 --> 38:33.635
- Come on!
- Okay, we're just gonna

38:33.646 --> 38:35.439
- have to break the glass.
- I have to break the glass.

38:35.463 --> 38:36.930
- Hold on.
- Bring the jaws of life.

38:37.007 --> 38:38.527
Eddie, jump bag
and extra medical gear.

38:38.559 --> 38:40.278
- My...
- Hen, I am taking this over.

38:40.302 --> 38:41.487
- You can't work on her.
- Come on, come on. No!

38:41.511 --> 38:43.206
Cap, Cap, I need to work on her!

38:43.230 --> 38:45.616
This is procedure, this is
procedure; We've got this.

38:45.640 --> 38:47.451
- I need to help her!
- No, we've got this.

38:47.475 --> 38:49.276
I need you to stand over here.

38:51.479 --> 38:54.948
- Yeah... her name is Evelyn.
- Okay, okay.

38:55.025 --> 38:57.835
Stay here. Stay here.

39:02.866 --> 39:04.499
Evelyn, can you hear me?

39:04.510 --> 39:07.085
Cap, there's more blood
in the car than in her body.

39:07.162 --> 39:08.670
- I know.
- She's unresponsive.

39:08.681 --> 39:11.183
Breathing is shallow.
There's no room in here.

39:11.207 --> 39:12.632
We have to pull her out.

39:22.719 --> 39:24.111
Okay, putting her down.

39:27.182 --> 39:29.533
Pelvis looks broken.
Thorax could be crushed.

39:29.610 --> 39:31.203
Possible organ damage.
Eddie, get in here.

39:35.398 --> 39:37.291
Come on. Come on.

39:49.871 --> 39:51.671
Ambulance just hit that car.

39:51.748 --> 39:54.341
I think she just hit that car.

40:02.902 --> 40:05.402
Hen. Hen, Hen.

40:05.479 --> 40:07.228
- Look here.
- Athena.

40:07.239 --> 40:09.356
W-w-what are you doing here?

40:09.432 --> 40:11.399
Bobby called me, okay?

40:11.410 --> 40:13.568
How you doing?
You gonna be okay?

40:13.579 --> 40:16.738
I-I-I don't know.

40:16.749 --> 40:20.116
The... the light.

40:20.193 --> 40:22.254
- Is Evelyn okay?
- They're working on her now.

40:22.278 --> 40:23.578
- Okay. Okay.
- Okay?

40:23.589 --> 40:26.581
I-I-I slowed... I slowed down.

40:26.592 --> 40:30.168
I thought I had the g-green,
but then I saw her.

40:30.245 --> 40:32.420
- But I know... but I couldn't...
- Listen, listen. Shh, shh.

40:32.431 --> 40:35.090
- You need to stop talking.
- B-b-but... but I did this.

40:35.100 --> 40:37.717
- Shh, shh, shh.
- Athena, I hit her!

40:37.794 --> 40:41.939
Hen, I love you, I love you,
but you need to shut up! Okay?

40:42.015 --> 40:45.266
Okay.
Listen to me.

40:45.277 --> 40:47.435
Listen to me! There's gonna be
an investigation.

40:47.446 --> 40:49.437
And it starts now.

40:49.448 --> 40:53.024
Okay, LAFD, LAPD, they're gonna
roll up on the scene

40:53.101 --> 40:53.775
with a lot of questions.

40:53.786 --> 40:55.619
Now listen to me.

40:55.696 --> 40:58.446
You need to think carefully
about what you're going to say.

40:58.457 --> 41:00.448
I want... I want to tell them
the truth.

41:00.459 --> 41:03.702
Yes. But you only tell them
what you know.

41:03.778 --> 41:06.037
Not what you think,
not what you feel.

41:06.114 --> 41:07.850
- Okay.
- Right? Answer the questions,

41:07.874 --> 41:09.749
but stick to the facts.

41:09.826 --> 41:12.210
You think you can do that?

41:12.287 --> 41:15.463
Henrietta?

41:15.474 --> 41:18.758
Henrietta!
No! Oh, oh! Ahh!

41:18.835 --> 41:20.515
- No!
- Shh, shh, shh.

00:00.500 --> 00:02.000
