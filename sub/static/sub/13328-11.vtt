01:03.458 --> 01:04.792
Thanks, Mel.
Thank you, Murray.

01:04.792 --> 01:07.583
Um, we're Flight
of the Conchords

01:07.583 --> 01:08.625
from New Zealand.

01:08.625 --> 01:10.708
Man:
Ha! New Zealand.

01:10.708 --> 01:14.125
And I just want to
say thank you on behalf
of Jemaine and myself...

01:14.125 --> 01:15.375
Not--
...for coming out--

01:15.375 --> 01:17.000
Not me.
Oh.

01:17.000 --> 01:19.333
Well, just on behalf
of myself, thank you
for coming along tonight.

01:19.333 --> 01:21.667
Good night.
Yes!

01:25.041 --> 01:26.667
Jemaine: Thank you.
Thanks.

01:26.667 --> 01:28.083
Looks delicious.

01:28.083 --> 01:30.333
I thought that went
pretty well.

01:30.333 --> 01:31.583
It was terrible.

01:31.583 --> 01:33.542
It was just the wrong
sort of crowd.

01:33.542 --> 01:35.291
You can't
call that a crowd.

01:35.291 --> 01:37.333
Yeah, three's a crowd.

01:38.417 --> 01:40.750
Yeah.
That was
definitely a crowd.

01:40.750 --> 01:42.917
Excuse me, Bret?
Jemaine?

01:42.917 --> 01:44.500
Hi.
I was in the audience.

01:44.500 --> 01:46.417
Uh, you were the guy
with the soup?
Yes, I was.

01:46.417 --> 01:47.667
Mm-hmm.
Oh yeah.

01:47.667 --> 01:49.542
What was
the soup like?
It was good.

01:49.542 --> 01:52.583
We get some free soup
for doing the gig.
Oh.

01:52.583 --> 01:54.667
Hey look,
watching you guys out there,

01:54.667 --> 01:56.333
I was blown away,
man.

01:56.333 --> 01:58.166
Your act
is sensational.

01:58.166 --> 01:59.834
Oh, thank you.
Thank you.

01:59.834 --> 02:02.500
Yeah, I love
the attention to detail
with your stage characters.

02:02.500 --> 02:05.625
Yeah.
I mean, the idea
of a pair of naive idiots

02:05.625 --> 02:08.750
from New Zealand--
it's so simple, it's genius.

02:08.750 --> 02:10.667
You just pick an obscure
backwards country

02:10.667 --> 02:13.208
that nobody knows
anything about--
very funny.

02:13.208 --> 02:15.542
Very funny.
So where are you guys from?

02:15.542 --> 02:17.708
The Juilliard School
of the Performing Arts?

02:17.708 --> 02:18.750
We're from New Zealand.

02:18.750 --> 02:21.000
Okay, wh--
New Zealand!

02:21.000 --> 02:24.250
I love New Zealand,
it's-- that's great!

02:24.250 --> 02:26.667
That's good information
to find out.

02:26.667 --> 02:28.333
I-- "Lord of the Rings,"

02:28.333 --> 02:30.458
Frodo.

02:30.458 --> 02:31.834
The ring.

02:33.208 --> 02:36.583
Anyway, don't let me
bore you with my knowledge
of New Zealand.

02:36.583 --> 02:39.208
( chuckles )
Here, in case you ever
need my services,

02:39.208 --> 02:42.792
I'm gonna give you my card.
I would love  to work
with you guys.

02:42.792 --> 02:44.291
What do you do?

02:44.291 --> 02:46.583
I am
a semiprofessional actor.

02:46.583 --> 02:48.000
Wow.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
Brilliant.
I can't say it enough.

02:50.000 --> 02:52.417
Brilliant.
This says "dry cleaners."

02:52.417 --> 02:54.583
The other side.
Written in pencil.

02:55.542 --> 02:57.708
Oh, yup.

02:58.917 --> 03:01.125
I thought you guys
did really well.

03:01.125 --> 03:02.542
Yeah, I thought
it was good.

03:02.542 --> 03:04.917
Maybe you could work
on your crowd work,
you know?

03:04.917 --> 03:07.208
Get more of a rapport
with the audience.

03:07.208 --> 03:08.583
Get them all clapping.

03:08.583 --> 03:10.417
I tried to talk to a guy
but he told me to shut up

03:10.417 --> 03:12.125
'cause he was reading
the paper.

03:12.125 --> 03:14.417
Oh, you don't
disturb people reading
the paper, Jemaine.

03:14.417 --> 03:16.959
Could be big news
he was getting into.

03:16.959 --> 03:18.583
We need to get
bigger audiences.

03:18.583 --> 03:20.500
I know, I thought
this one would be big.

03:20.500 --> 03:22.375
What am I doing wrong?

03:22.375 --> 03:24.083
Maybe it's something
we're  doing wrong.

03:24.083 --> 03:25.959
Would it help if
our music was better?

03:25.959 --> 03:27.917
Possibly, yeah.

03:27.917 --> 03:29.792
It doesn't matter
how good your music is

03:29.792 --> 03:31.792
if no one's there
to hear it.

03:31.792 --> 03:34.125
What about if we give out
some free pencils?

03:34.125 --> 03:35.917
No, you're not in
New Zealand now, Bret.

03:35.917 --> 03:37.875
I know, but we gave
them out, remember that?

03:37.875 --> 03:39.834
We got a box
of 20 pencils...

03:39.834 --> 03:41.000
Yeah.
And that night...

03:41.000 --> 03:42.542
20 people.
...20--
Everyone was there.

03:42.542 --> 03:44.333
I know-- I know,
all the bands did it.

03:44.333 --> 03:45.917
This is America.
It's different.

03:45.917 --> 03:48.458
Murray, did you manage
to get us a record deal?

03:49.708 --> 03:52.834
Probably not, I guess.
Good guess. Nothing.

03:52.834 --> 03:55.667
Not even
a "Thanks for the demo.
We're not interested.

03:55.667 --> 03:58.083
"But thanks again
for trying...

03:58.083 --> 04:00.250
every day."

04:02.041 --> 04:04.500
( whispers ) Say it.
Cheer up, Murray.

04:04.500 --> 04:06.583
Cheer up.

06:06.375 --> 06:08.792
And you organized the soup.
That's good management.

06:08.792 --> 06:12.083
Yeah, how'd you manage to
get us some soup? Huh?

06:12.083 --> 06:13.750
( knocks on door )
Oh, speaking of which.

06:13.750 --> 06:15.750
Woman:
We need you guys to
clear out of this room.

06:15.750 --> 06:18.250
The janitor needs
to use the mop sink.

06:18.250 --> 06:20.125
Uh, I'm actually
the manager of the band.

06:20.125 --> 06:21.583
I believe we've got
two soups coming.

06:21.583 --> 06:23.959
We ran out of soup
two hours ago, Marty.

06:23.959 --> 06:26.792
Sorry.
( door closes )

06:27.667 --> 06:29.792
I couldn't even
get that right.

06:33.875 --> 06:36.500
So you have to call up
our manager, Murray,

06:36.500 --> 06:38.458
and pretend you work
for a big record label

06:38.458 --> 06:40.959
and just tell him
to keep on trying.

06:40.959 --> 06:43.458
Yeah, give him
a rejection call
to cheer him up.

06:43.458 --> 06:45.000
Okay.
He's a little bit sad.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.291
Okay, I get it.
So I just say,

06:47.291 --> 06:50.083
"I heard your stuff,
it's not for us,
but keep trying."

06:50.083 --> 06:51.250
Both: Yeah.
Okay.

06:51.250 --> 06:53.083
That's perfect.
Okay, good.

06:53.083 --> 06:55.500
So tell me a bit more
about this character
you want me to create.

06:55.500 --> 06:58.750
Hmm?
Who is  this
record-label guy?

06:58.750 --> 06:59.917
What makes him tick?

06:59.917 --> 07:02.458
It's you pretending
to be someone else.

07:02.458 --> 07:03.834
I see. Okay.

07:03.834 --> 07:06.458
Already I'm getting
a feel for this guy.

07:06.458 --> 07:08.125
Uh, listen,

07:08.125 --> 07:10.708
let me demonstrate
a few characters.
You'll see.

07:10.708 --> 07:13.792
This is Stefan,
who is like...

07:15.458 --> 07:17.458
Hey, hello.

07:17.458 --> 07:19.375
I'm Stefan.

07:19.375 --> 07:21.166
Then there's
Big Eddie,

07:21.166 --> 07:24.125
who is this tough,
no-nonsense mobster,

07:24.125 --> 07:25.667
and he is like this...

07:25.667 --> 07:29.250
Hey, what-- what's with
all the commotion?

07:29.250 --> 07:30.959
What's this commotion?

07:30.959 --> 07:34.542
Explain to me
what's with the commotion!

07:34.542 --> 07:35.917
Whoa.

07:35.917 --> 07:38.417
That's very good.
Flippin' awesome.

07:38.417 --> 07:41.458
P--probably not right
for this-- this though.

07:41.458 --> 07:43.083
Probably.
Yeah.

07:43.083 --> 07:44.375
Okay, well, I--

07:44.375 --> 07:46.375
I have been working on
a character from New Zealand.

07:46.375 --> 07:48.625
Okay, what's he like?
Oh.

07:48.625 --> 07:52.208
Hey, watch out,
you flamin' drongo!

07:52.208 --> 07:56.166
Don't be such
a flamin' bloody drongo!

07:56.166 --> 07:58.708
Could-- could you do it
in your normal voice, maybe?

07:58.708 --> 08:00.041
No.

08:00.041 --> 08:01.750
That's not acting.

08:01.750 --> 08:03.458
Well, I think I like
the first one.

08:03.458 --> 08:05.458
Mmm.
Mm-hmm.

08:05.458 --> 08:06.875
Um...

08:06.875 --> 08:08.917
Did we mention that
we really can't pay you...

08:08.917 --> 08:10.875
Can't pay you.
...at all?

08:10.875 --> 08:14.417
Opportunity is
in itself reward.

08:14.417 --> 08:17.208
And so it begins.

08:17.208 --> 08:18.708
Ding.

08:24.917 --> 08:27.750
Could you guys
leave, please?

08:32.750 --> 08:35.750
( ringing )

08:39.333 --> 08:42.000
New Zealand Consulate,
Murray Hewitt speaking.

08:42.000 --> 08:45.417
Is this Murray Hewitt,
the band manager?

08:45.417 --> 08:47.291
Yes.
I'm him.

08:47.291 --> 08:50.250
Murray, this is Stefan
from the record company.

08:50.250 --> 08:51.583
Stefan who?

08:51.583 --> 08:53.333
Stefan... Gucci,

08:53.333 --> 08:55.417
you know, from
the record company.

08:55.417 --> 08:57.208
Okay, well...

08:57.208 --> 08:59.041
which record company
was that?

08:59.041 --> 09:01.417
You know, the--
the big one.

09:01.417 --> 09:03.792
Sony?
Yeah, uh-huh.

09:03.792 --> 09:06.208
Sony.
Have you got
the demo CD then?

09:06.208 --> 09:08.375
Listen, Murray,
all of us here at, uh--

09:08.375 --> 09:10.125
Sony?
Exactly.

09:10.125 --> 09:13.375
Uh, we all think
you're doing great work
with the Conchords.

09:13.375 --> 09:15.125
Really super stuff.

09:15.125 --> 09:17.291
Thanks, that's nice to hear.
Thanks, Stefan.

09:17.291 --> 09:20.542
Look, the bad news
though is for...

09:20.542 --> 09:22.458
some very
good reasons,

09:22.458 --> 09:24.917
we can't sign your band
in the short term.

09:24.917 --> 09:26.583
So you're not offering us
a record deal?

09:26.583 --> 09:29.625
No. But--
but you  are brilliant.

09:29.625 --> 09:31.625
You are great,
and I love the guys.

09:31.625 --> 09:34.166
Well, if you like us
so much, why can't you
just offer us a deal, you know?

09:34.166 --> 09:36.500
You're just not what we're
looking for at the moment,

09:36.500 --> 09:39.792
Okay?
( sighs )

09:39.792 --> 09:41.500
( whispers )
God.

09:41.500 --> 09:44.208
Please offer us
a record contract.

09:44.208 --> 09:46.792
Please?
I'm begging you.

09:46.792 --> 09:48.625
Come on, please.

09:48.625 --> 09:50.875
Please.

09:50.875 --> 09:53.500
Please give us
a record deal.

09:53.500 --> 09:56.625
( crying )
Oh, come on.

09:56.625 --> 09:59.667
( sobbing )

10:01.834 --> 10:03.792
Okay then.

10:05.375 --> 10:08.917
Really?
Yeah, why not?

10:08.917 --> 10:10.542
Thank you!

10:10.542 --> 10:11.959
Thank you,
thank you, thank you.

10:11.959 --> 10:14.583
Look, we won't let you down.
You won't regret this.

10:14.583 --> 10:16.875
I'm sure I won't.

10:22.500 --> 10:24.625
Gentlemen,
welcome to the restaurant!

10:24.625 --> 10:27.458
Thanks for flying in
from L.A., Mr. Gucci.

10:27.458 --> 10:29.208
That was
extremely quick.

10:29.208 --> 10:31.375
Well, I flew
in a supersonic jet.

10:31.375 --> 10:32.834
Wow, a supersonic jet.

10:32.834 --> 10:34.542
How about that, guys?
Hmm.

10:34.542 --> 10:38.625
It is great to meet you guys
for the first time.

10:38.625 --> 10:39.917
Be polite.

10:39.917 --> 10:41.458
Great to meet you,
Mr. Gucci.

10:41.458 --> 10:42.625
Mmm.
"Good to meet you."

10:42.625 --> 10:44.166
A real pleasure.
Good, nice.

10:44.166 --> 10:46.375
Shall we have
a seat?

10:48.041 --> 10:49.583
Right.

10:50.458 --> 10:52.458
So, the record deal.

10:52.458 --> 10:54.375
Uh yes.
Mr. Gucci,

10:54.375 --> 10:56.792
Sorry,
but my manager here

10:56.792 --> 10:58.959
has appeared
to have made a mistake.

10:58.959 --> 11:01.083
Yeah, he thinks you've
offered us a record deal.

11:01.083 --> 11:03.458
I think you've offered
us a rejection deal.

11:03.458 --> 11:06.375
No no, he's offered us
a record acceptance deal.

11:06.375 --> 11:09.583
That's not right, is it?
No, Murray's absolutely right.

11:09.583 --> 11:11.166
Yes, it was
a rejection call,

11:11.166 --> 11:14.125
but then I turned you round,
didn't I? With my managing.

11:14.125 --> 11:15.500
Yes.
Yeah.

11:15.500 --> 11:16.959
He started crying.

11:16.959 --> 11:19.000
Ah. Yeah well,
anyway,

11:19.000 --> 11:20.834
we're here to negotiate
the deal now, aren't we?

11:20.834 --> 11:22.291
All right?
Exactly.

11:22.291 --> 11:24.708
Now listen, guys,
I don't want to blow
smoke up your ass.

11:24.708 --> 11:27.583
No, not gonna...
do that sort of thing.

11:27.583 --> 11:29.291
We're thinking
a $1-million deal

11:29.291 --> 11:32.750
and we are firm on that, okay?
That's our final offer.

11:32.750 --> 11:34.458
No.

11:34.458 --> 11:35.750
No way.

11:35.750 --> 11:37.625
Yes.
No.

11:37.625 --> 11:40.291
Okay, two million.

11:40.291 --> 11:43.333
I thought you
said one million was
your final offer?

11:43.333 --> 11:45.625
Two million, but I want
a 90/10 split.

11:45.625 --> 11:47.917
Ah. I see.

11:47.917 --> 11:49.417
Ah. Right.

11:49.417 --> 11:51.000
Well, that's
a terrible deal,

11:51.000 --> 11:54.000
so, sorry,
we can't do it.
Oh well.

11:54.000 --> 11:56.667
No no no no,
let's negotiate.

11:56.667 --> 11:58.542
Um, Stefan,

11:58.542 --> 12:01.417
please, what about a--
a flip-around?

12:01.417 --> 12:04.834
I mean, if we could go for
the 90 and you have the 10?

12:04.834 --> 12:05.959
Super.

12:05.959 --> 12:08.333
Whoa.
See what I did there?

12:08.333 --> 12:10.625
Huh? Yes!

12:10.625 --> 12:12.000
Where do we sign?

12:12.000 --> 12:14.667
Uh, well, I don't--
I don't think we should
be so hasty...

12:14.667 --> 12:16.041
We got it.
...here.

12:16.041 --> 12:17.291
Be hasty.
No.

12:17.291 --> 12:19.333
I don't-- Is this
a good deal, you know?

12:19.333 --> 12:20.959
Yes.
Is it, though?

12:20.959 --> 12:22.083
Yes.
Is it?

12:22.083 --> 12:23.708
Yes.
But--

12:23.708 --> 12:26.417
But is it?
Yes.

12:26.417 --> 12:28.792
Well, what about for you?
Is it a good deal for you?

12:28.792 --> 12:32.125
Oh, quite frankly, this
is a terrible deal for me.

12:32.125 --> 12:33.959
Do we want to do deals
with people

12:33.959 --> 12:35.834
who do such terrible deals
for themselves?

12:35.834 --> 12:37.041
I think so.
Why not?

12:37.041 --> 12:38.500
Yeah.
Bret!

12:38.500 --> 12:40.500
Uh... no idea.

12:40.500 --> 12:42.000
Yeah, I see.
We need to make sure

12:42.000 --> 12:44.708
that your record label
has the right ideas for us.

12:44.708 --> 12:46.000
Oh, I've got some
great ideas.

12:46.000 --> 12:48.834
Name one.
Lunch boxes.

12:48.834 --> 12:50.625
Great.
Put the band's name on it.

12:50.625 --> 12:52.834
Yeah?
Yes yes yes yes yes!

12:52.834 --> 12:54.333
That
could work too.

12:54.333 --> 12:56.792
Or-- how about this?
How about this?

12:56.792 --> 12:59.041
We make a music video
to coincide

12:59.041 --> 13:00.583
with the 10th anniversary

13:00.583 --> 13:02.417
of "The Lord
of the Rings" trilogy.

13:02.417 --> 13:04.625
Yup.
( moans )

13:06.333 --> 13:07.834
I know Peter Jackson,

13:07.834 --> 13:10.750
and he was very  excited
by this idea.

13:10.750 --> 13:13.458
Well, that would have
to be a "no," though.

13:13.458 --> 13:14.583
( sighs )

13:14.583 --> 13:16.583
All right, look.
Time-out there, all right?

13:16.583 --> 13:18.917
Sorry, Stefan.
I'm just gonna have
a word with the guys.

13:18.917 --> 13:20.417
All right?
Come on.

13:21.500 --> 13:22.875
( whispering )
What are you doing?

13:22.875 --> 13:24.667
( whispering ) I got
a little carried away.
Yeah.

13:24.667 --> 13:26.834
You weren't supposed to
offer him a record deal.

13:26.834 --> 13:29.375
I'm sorry about the deal,
but from an actor's standpoint,

13:29.375 --> 13:31.125
( kisses ) Oh!
Murray: Jemaine!

13:31.125 --> 13:33.458
Stop annoying him.
Come here.

13:33.458 --> 13:35.291
Okay, emergency band meeting.
Jemaine?
Yes.

13:35.291 --> 13:36.959
Bret?
Mmm.

13:36.959 --> 13:39.708
Murray, present.
Now this seems like
a really really good deal.

13:39.708 --> 13:41.458
Yeah? I haven't seen
many music deals--

13:41.458 --> 13:43.583
Any. You haven't seen any.
I haven't seen any.

13:43.583 --> 13:45.250
But I know a good percentage
when I see one.

13:45.250 --> 13:47.125
It does seem a little
too good to be true.

13:47.125 --> 13:48.333
It is too good
to be true.

13:48.333 --> 13:49.875
That's why we should
go for it.

13:49.875 --> 13:53.208
Come on.
I've done the mathematics
in my head.

13:53.208 --> 13:55.250
The percentages
are in our favor.

13:55.250 --> 13:56.708
There you go.
Yeah.

13:56.708 --> 13:58.708
I know.
I think maybe we
should take the deal.

13:58.708 --> 14:00.500
Let's put it
to the vote. Yeah?

14:00.500 --> 14:02.750
All those
in favor say "aye."
( whispers ) Hey.

14:02.750 --> 14:03.834
Aye.
Aye.

14:03.834 --> 14:05.583
Nay!
No, two ayes,

14:05.583 --> 14:07.834
One nay, you're gone.
Motion carried.

14:07.834 --> 14:09.125
We've got it!

14:09.125 --> 14:11.917
Stefan, we'd love to take
the $2-million deal!

14:11.917 --> 14:13.834
Great!
( whispering )
What are you doing?

14:13.834 --> 14:15.917
( whispering ) I just got
a bit carried away, I was...

14:15.917 --> 14:18.417
Just-- Stefan's
so good at it.

14:19.083 --> 14:20.583
Ben.
He--

14:20.583 --> 14:23.708
Yeah, but, I mean, Murray,
he's having a good time.

14:23.708 --> 14:25.500
I know it's not real,

14:25.500 --> 14:27.375
but lunch boxes...

14:31.917 --> 14:34.291
Congratulations, man.
That's awesome.

14:34.291 --> 14:35.792
Way to go.
Thanks, Dave.

14:35.792 --> 14:37.959
Yeah, but
it's not real.
Yeah.

14:37.959 --> 14:39.583
Yeah, it's not real.
You know?

14:39.583 --> 14:41.959
I mean, what do you
think we should do?

14:41.959 --> 14:43.792
I think you've got
to use honesty here.

14:43.792 --> 14:45.917
I mean, you know,
it's always the best policy.

14:45.917 --> 14:47.667
Like, the other day
there was five--

14:47.667 --> 14:50.041
or maybe there was like four--
really hot foreign chicks,

14:50.041 --> 14:52.208
either like, Swedish
or Korean, in my shop.

14:52.208 --> 14:54.041
Wow.
And they were like, "Dave,

14:54.041 --> 14:56.625
we want to have
a five-way with you,"
and I just told them,

14:56.625 --> 14:58.375
honestly, "Okay."

14:58.375 --> 15:00.291
Then I just gave it
to them hard.

15:00.291 --> 15:02.000
That's the best way
to go.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.166
And then after that,
they're like, "Hey,
will you marry us?"

15:04.166 --> 15:06.125
and I was like, "Excuse me,
but I don't think

15:06.125 --> 15:09.083
monogamy is legal
in this country, I don't
know where you're from."

15:09.083 --> 15:11.166
but you've got
to try honesty.

15:11.166 --> 15:12.625
It works the best.

15:12.625 --> 15:14.625
Yeah.
Yeah, we should tell
him the truth.

15:14.625 --> 15:17.708
We've got to tell him
before this gets out of hand.

15:17.708 --> 15:19.583
Okay, guys,
come on.

15:19.583 --> 15:22.000
Look a bit more
afraid, okay?

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
Don't be scared
of the sand--

15:24.000 --> 15:25.667
the dirt
on your feet, Bret.

15:25.667 --> 15:27.708
There's condoms around here.
Used condoms.

15:27.708 --> 15:29.667
Put your feet
down properly.

15:29.667 --> 15:32.708
Okay, so you're scared,
you're huddling together.

15:32.708 --> 15:34.959
Ringwraith
is coming.

15:34.959 --> 15:37.625
Get your ring out.

15:37.625 --> 15:39.000
And action!

15:39.750 --> 15:41.166
Okay, Mel?
Yeah.

15:41.166 --> 15:42.792
Now you're Arwen,
all right?

15:42.792 --> 15:44.166
Liv Tyler.
Mm-hmm.

15:44.166 --> 15:46.625
Okay, so I want you
to command the water

15:46.625 --> 15:49.458
to do your bidding.
Okay?

15:49.458 --> 15:51.750
( speaking mock-Elvish )

15:51.750 --> 15:54.000
I-- I can't understand
a word you're saying.

15:54.000 --> 15:56.333
Articulate, all right?
It's Elvish.
That's Elvish.

15:56.333 --> 15:58.542
Are you chewing
something?
No, it's Elv--

15:58.542 --> 16:00.083
It's-- It's my
native tongue.

16:00.083 --> 16:01.750
Is it?
Yup.

16:01.750 --> 16:03.208
All right.

16:03.208 --> 16:04.834
Okay, go.

16:04.834 --> 16:07.834
( speaking mock-Elvish )

16:10.542 --> 16:11.917
Yes! That's it!

16:11.917 --> 16:14.208
Was that it?
Yup, that's it.

16:14.208 --> 16:15.667

18:12.250 --> 18:14.083
It's been a really
great day, guys.

18:14.083 --> 18:16.458
Really great.
Yeah.

18:16.458 --> 18:18.959
I just want
to savor this moment.

18:20.708 --> 18:22.500
Here, have a cigar each.

18:22.500 --> 18:24.000
Oh.
Come on.

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
I don't smoke.
Oh yeah, I don't smoke.

18:26.000 --> 18:28.500
Well, neither do I,
but it's a special occasion.

18:28.500 --> 18:30.792
I was gonna
keep this secret, but...

18:30.792 --> 18:32.417
I might as well
tell you.

18:32.417 --> 18:34.834
Tomorrow night,
I've booked a VIP lounge

18:34.834 --> 18:37.667
at a very posh nightclub,
for the wrap party.

18:37.667 --> 18:39.667
Is it expensive?
You deserve it.

18:39.667 --> 18:41.041
No, we don't.
No.

18:41.041 --> 18:43.375
Of course you do.
Yeah, Murray,

18:43.375 --> 18:44.959
Um...

18:44.959 --> 18:46.875
there's something
Jemaine wants to tell you.

18:46.875 --> 18:49.041
What, about the video?
Bret: Yeah.

18:49.041 --> 18:51.708
There's something I've got
to tell you about the video.

18:51.708 --> 18:54.000
I know.
That it's the best thing

18:54.000 --> 18:55.417
I've ever done
in my life, right?

18:55.417 --> 18:57.208
Yeah.
It is, yeah.

18:57.208 --> 18:58.333
Yeah.
Yeah

18:58.333 --> 19:00.583
It's all right.
I already know that.

19:00.583 --> 19:02.125
I know it is.
Thank you, though.

19:02.125 --> 19:04.750
I'm gonna put
my hat back on.

19:06.166 --> 19:08.041
Eh?

19:14.959 --> 19:17.875
( hip-hop music playing )

19:17.875 --> 19:20.250
Here you go, guys.
You want some of this?

19:20.250 --> 19:23.041
Enjoy the party tonight.
I manage the band.

19:23.041 --> 19:24.542
I'm the band manager.

19:24.542 --> 19:26.208
Get into it.

19:26.208 --> 19:28.083
Rock 'n' roll!
Whoo!

19:28.083 --> 19:30.250
There we go.
Whoo!

19:30.250 --> 19:32.041
Cheers,
good times.

19:32.041 --> 19:34.250
I like to rock the party.
Hey, what about a photo?

19:34.250 --> 19:37.166
Hey hey!
I'll keep that one.

19:37.166 --> 19:40.250
I'll get your email
address or-- okay!

19:40.250 --> 19:41.750
I'm the manager
of the guys.

19:41.750 --> 19:43.250
There's the band
over there.

19:43.250 --> 19:44.625
You like
"Lord of the Rings"?

19:44.625 --> 19:46.291
You'll love
the video we've made.

19:46.291 --> 19:48.708
I'm gonna do
a speech, I think.
It's time for that.

19:48.708 --> 19:50.583
( glass clinking )

19:50.583 --> 19:52.875
You can't hear
the clinking.

19:53.959 --> 19:56.417
Can I have the music down,
please, DJ? Please?

19:56.417 --> 19:58.041
Oh, we don't...
All right.

19:58.041 --> 20:00.041
Sorry, everyone, I just
want to have a few words.

20:00.041 --> 20:01.542
I'm not gonna
keep you long.

20:01.542 --> 20:03.291
But I just feel like
I should say something

20:03.291 --> 20:04.917
to mark this
historic occasion...

20:04.917 --> 20:07.625
Um, about the guys,
Bret and Jemaine.

20:07.625 --> 20:09.333
Get up, guys, everyone.
( all cheer )

20:09.333 --> 20:11.792
Come on, come up
and stand up here.

20:11.792 --> 20:14.083
Woman: Whoo!
Just come around,
stand beside me

20:14.083 --> 20:15.291
on each side.

20:15.291 --> 20:17.291
Um, I've known these guys
for a while now.

20:17.291 --> 20:19.959
When I first met them, I knew
they had something special,

20:19.959 --> 20:21.917
something I like to
call the "A" factor.

20:21.917 --> 20:24.083
Which is,
when you see them,
you go "Eh!"

20:24.083 --> 20:26.166
You know, there's that
something special there.

20:26.166 --> 20:28.417
And I remember when they
first came into my office--

20:28.417 --> 20:29.959
Remember?
Yes.

20:29.959 --> 20:32.375
--a while ago now, they had
their guitar cases in tow,

20:32.375 --> 20:34.083
and they walked in
and they announced,

20:34.083 --> 20:36.083
"We can't find our passports,"
or something.

20:36.083 --> 20:37.708
What was it?
"We've lost our passports."

20:37.708 --> 20:39.667
"We've lost our passports."
I knew at that moment

20:39.667 --> 20:41.417
that these guys were
gonna be huge, you know?

20:41.417 --> 20:44.208
They just--
they've got something
about them, an aura.

20:44.208 --> 20:46.625
A-- a year and half
of, you know,

20:46.625 --> 20:48.583
not always good times.
There's a lot of struggle.

20:48.583 --> 20:50.417
Wasn't there?
Depressing,

20:50.417 --> 20:51.834
A lot of it?
Some depression.

20:51.834 --> 20:53.333
Yeah?
Yeah.

20:53.333 --> 20:55.875
But we're here now.
We're here, down the track.

20:55.875 --> 20:58.333
And this is it.
We've passed the point.

20:58.333 --> 20:59.500
It's all been worth it.

20:59.500 --> 21:01.500
Tonight's about
celebrating the success.

21:01.500 --> 21:04.125
So, charge your glasses
and drink up tonight,

21:04.125 --> 21:06.250
'Cause it's all on us.
Uh, no, we...

21:06.250 --> 21:07.917
Yup!
...probably shouldn't.

21:07.917 --> 21:10.041
Don't worry about it, Jemaine.
Here's to Flight
of the Conchords!

21:10.041 --> 21:14.125
The drinks are on us!
( all cheer )

21:16.000 --> 21:18.417
Well, welcome to
your new life, eh?

21:18.417 --> 21:20.333
Mmm.
How's it feel?

21:20.333 --> 21:21.458
More champagne?

21:21.458 --> 21:24.000
Uh, no, I'm just
having water.

21:24.000 --> 21:25.959
Water? Unsuccessful
people have water.

21:25.959 --> 21:27.375
You're on champagne now.

21:27.375 --> 21:29.291
Murray, I think we should
probably go home.

21:29.291 --> 21:31.333
Yeah, I've got
the check here.

21:31.333 --> 21:32.708
Whoa, $600.

21:32.708 --> 21:34.250
How are we
gonna pay for that?

21:34.250 --> 21:35.875
Eh?
How are we
gonna afford that?

21:35.875 --> 21:37.542
Stefan gave me
a code.

21:37.542 --> 21:39.917
Special industry code,
pays for everything--

21:39.917 --> 21:42.875
Drinks,
jet boats, caviar...

21:42.875 --> 21:45.000
everything.
Watch this.

21:45.000 --> 21:46.708
I think--
Waiter?

21:46.708 --> 21:49.291
Yes, sir?
I'd like to settle
the bill, please.

21:49.291 --> 21:51.375
Put on a little bit
on for yourself, 100 bucks.

21:51.375 --> 21:53.375
That's fine.
Oh, thank you
very much, sir.

21:53.375 --> 21:55.458
It's all right.
How will you be paying?

21:55.458 --> 21:57.375
Uh, with the code.

21:57.375 --> 21:59.959
Code?
Come in,
I'll tell you.

21:59.959 --> 22:03.750
5768-745...

22:03.750 --> 22:05.708
2156.

22:05.708 --> 22:07.417
Sir, I don't know
what you're talking about.

22:07.417 --> 22:10.834
576--
Yeah, I heard you
the first time, sir.

22:10.834 --> 22:13.917
I just don't have any idea
what you're talking about.

22:13.917 --> 22:16.250
That's weird. I bet Meatloaf
never had this problem, eh?

22:16.250 --> 22:18.625
( whispers )
You know, the music code--
pays for everything.

22:18.625 --> 22:22.875
Sir, we accept
Mastercard, AmEx or Visa.

22:25.583 --> 22:28.708
Bret, see if you
can get that cork back
in that bottle, will you?

22:28.708 --> 22:31.041
I'm gonna give
Stefan a call.

22:37.583 --> 22:39.917
Murray, um...

22:39.917 --> 22:41.667
we need to
tell you something.

22:41.667 --> 22:44.667
What?
Ben isn't actually
a record executive.

22:44.667 --> 22:46.208
Who?
Stefan.

22:46.208 --> 22:49.542
He-- he's not
a record executive,
he's a dry cleaner.

22:49.542 --> 22:51.667
What do you mean?
Of course he's an exec.

22:51.667 --> 22:54.166
Good one. What about
the conference call

22:54.166 --> 22:56.125
between him, me,
Peter Jackson,

22:56.125 --> 22:58.166
the guy
from the Mafia?

22:58.166 --> 23:00.083
Eddie, from the Mafia?
Yeah, that's him.

23:00.083 --> 23:01.959
Fat Eddie?
Fat Eddie, yep.

23:01.959 --> 23:03.417
"Lot of commotion"?
That's what he--

23:03.417 --> 23:04.917
How do you know
about that?

23:04.917 --> 23:07.250
That's just one
of the characters
that Ben does.

23:07.250 --> 23:08.667
Characters?

23:08.667 --> 23:10.458
One man did all
those characters?

23:10.458 --> 23:11.792
He's semiprofessional.

23:11.792 --> 23:14.125
You're telling me that
this is all a joke?

23:14.125 --> 23:15.208
Not a joke, but--

23:15.208 --> 23:16.917
organized by a couple
of jesters!

23:16.917 --> 23:20.417
Is this you, is it?
"Oh, let's do a jest,

23:20.417 --> 23:22.792
a great big--
great big lark

23:22.792 --> 23:25.000
in the courtyard
of the king,

23:25.000 --> 23:27.250
and see how he
takes it!" Is it?

23:27.250 --> 23:29.834
Is that what
you're telling me?
Yes.

23:35.250 --> 23:36.417
( sighs )

23:36.417 --> 23:38.333
Well, that went better
than I thought it would.

23:38.333 --> 23:40.166
Yeah, that cleared it up.

23:45.917 --> 23:48.208
Guys--
hang on, okay?

23:48.208 --> 23:51.041
That was not me.
That was Stefan.

23:51.041 --> 23:52.500
But it was you.

23:52.500 --> 23:55.375
No no no no.
Stefan is his own person.

23:55.375 --> 23:57.500
It looked like you.
Sure!

23:57.500 --> 23:58.750
You play Stefan.

23:58.750 --> 24:01.667
Stefan works through me.
He's like a spirit.

24:01.667 --> 24:03.250
Well, it ended
terribly.

24:03.250 --> 24:05.834
We had this big
wrap party that
Murray put on

24:05.834 --> 24:07.291
and he paid
for it himself.

24:07.291 --> 24:09.000
Spent a lot of money
on the music video,

24:09.000 --> 24:10.375
the Ringwraith costumes.

24:10.375 --> 24:12.083
And he might have to
move into his office

24:12.083 --> 24:13.959
'cause he can't
afford his rent.

24:13.959 --> 24:16.208
When he lives in
his office, he washes
his underpants in the sink

24:16.208 --> 24:17.708
and dries them
in the microwave.

24:17.708 --> 24:19.834
It's very humiliating
for everyone involved.

24:19.834 --> 24:22.041
You guys are
absolutely right.

24:22.041 --> 24:24.000
Okay, I guess, I--

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
Sometimes I just...

24:26.000 --> 24:29.625
underestimate the power
of my own acting skills.

24:29.625 --> 24:30.667
Mmm.
Yeah.

24:30.667 --> 24:32.000
Look, I want to
make this right.

24:32.000 --> 24:33.458
How much
did Murray spend?

24:33.458 --> 24:35.792
Oh, he spent
about $700.

24:35.792 --> 24:39.000
No, including
the video shoot,
it was more like $750.

24:39.000 --> 24:42.291
I'm gonna say
$1,000,

24:42.291 --> 24:45.959
payable to
Murray Hewitt.

24:45.959 --> 24:47.208
Ah.

24:48.417 --> 24:51.041
All right, I feel good
about this.

24:51.041 --> 24:53.583
That's very generous.
Yeah.

24:53.583 --> 24:57.000
Um, this is
a laundry ticket.

24:58.000 --> 25:00.041
Yes.

25:00.041 --> 25:02.708
But  I will
send you the money

25:02.708 --> 25:04.500
as soon as I get
to Hollywood.

25:04.500 --> 25:07.375
Mmm, when are you
gonna go to Hollywood?

25:07.375 --> 25:09.917
Didn't I tell you guys?

25:11.000 --> 25:13.291
I'm going to
Hollywood right now.

25:13.291 --> 25:15.125
That big part has
finally come in.

25:15.125 --> 25:17.750
Martin Scorsese
is doing a movie

25:17.750 --> 25:19.417
about a dry cleaner.

25:19.417 --> 25:21.917
What's it called?
"Dry Cleaner."

25:21.917 --> 25:23.792
So I'm off
to Hollywood right now.

25:23.792 --> 25:25.834
It was great
knowing you guys.
Okay.

25:25.834 --> 25:28.417
Congratulations, Ben.
Thank you, thank you.

25:31.083 --> 25:34.333
Oh at least that's--
that's good news for Ben.

25:34.333 --> 25:36.250
Bret...

25:36.250 --> 25:37.750
He's acting.

25:37.750 --> 25:39.542
( whispering )
You think that was acting?

25:39.542 --> 25:41.083
( whispering )
He's acting.

25:41.083 --> 25:43.583
God, he's good.
He is good.
He's very good.

25:43.583 --> 25:45.375
Could you guys
please leave?

25:45.375 --> 25:48.250
We're just waiting
on our dry cleaning.

25:50.834 --> 25:52.417
Thank you, Ben.

25:57.667 --> 25:59.625
Murray.
Oh, look who it is.

25:59.625 --> 26:00.875
In you come.

26:00.875 --> 26:03.208
The merry jesters.

26:03.208 --> 26:04.291
Have a seat.

26:04.291 --> 26:06.083
( sighs )

26:06.083 --> 26:08.041
I'm just having
another look

26:08.041 --> 26:10.125
at Stefan's
professional credentials.

26:10.125 --> 26:13.333
"To Ben, thanks for keeping
me clean, Art Garfunkel."

26:14.625 --> 26:17.708
I thought that was some
sort of drug rehab thing.

26:17.708 --> 26:19.750
"Your whites are
the whitest."

26:19.750 --> 26:22.000
Well, thought that
was a Beatles album.

26:22.000 --> 26:25.625
"To Ben,
thanks for dry-cleaning
my clothes for me,

26:25.625 --> 26:27.125
Debbie Harry."

26:27.125 --> 26:28.583
That makes sense now.

26:28.583 --> 26:29.625
We're sorry, Murray.

26:29.625 --> 26:31.834
For what?
Huh?

26:31.834 --> 26:33.834
Making me look
like king of the dicks?

26:33.834 --> 26:36.000
We just thought you needed
some positive reinforcement.

26:36.000 --> 26:38.375
It's all right. It's not
even your fault, really.

26:38.375 --> 26:39.667
I'm the dick.

26:39.667 --> 26:41.333
I should have seen it
at the meeting.

26:41.333 --> 26:44.125
A 90/10 split.
That's ridiculous.

26:44.125 --> 26:46.750
Not even "Crowded House"
gets a 90/10 split.

26:46.750 --> 26:48.333
Don't they?
No.

26:48.333 --> 26:52.875
80/20, maybe,
but 90/10's unheard of.

26:52.875 --> 26:56.333
I know it's pretend,
but I thought you did really
well in that meeting.

26:56.333 --> 26:58.375
Yeah?
Jemaine: Yeah.

26:58.375 --> 26:59.750
Eh, Bret?
Yep.

26:59.750 --> 27:00.834
Well...

27:00.834 --> 27:02.792
I didn't want to
say anything, but...

27:02.792 --> 27:04.667
I was hoping
you'd bring that up.

27:04.667 --> 27:06.041
I kind of
felt that as well.

27:06.041 --> 27:07.917
Did you?
Yeah, I did do well,
didn't I?

27:07.917 --> 27:09.083
You did.
Yeah.

27:09.083 --> 27:12.542
That was my--
my proudest moment,

27:12.542 --> 27:15.166
that meeting.

27:15.166 --> 27:18.000
( microwave beeps )
Oh look, it's my undies.

27:21.417 --> 27:23.250
Ooh, hot.

27:32.583 --> 27:34.875
Excuse me.

27:34.875 --> 27:37.333
( theme music playing )

27:43.458 --> 27:45.792
( dramatic music playing )

27:45.792 --> 27:47.792
So many empty seats

27:47.792 --> 27:50.250
and a story to go
with each of 'em.

27:50.250 --> 27:52.542
You've got
that right, Jim.

27:52.542 --> 27:54.333
Oh, and one more thing:

27:54.333 --> 27:58.417
you know that ticket stub
I gave you from the dead guy's
suit pocket?

27:58.417 --> 28:01.333
Yeah?
Look at the date.

28:01.333 --> 28:02.917
Seems a little unusual

28:02.917 --> 28:04.750
that a man would go out
to the theater

28:04.750 --> 28:08.792
three days after
he's been reported kidnapped.

28:12.667 --> 28:14.583
You know, Max,

28:14.583 --> 28:17.417
you should have
been a cop.

28:17.417 --> 28:20.291
I should have been
a lot of things, Jim.

28:20.291 --> 28:23.583
I should have
been a lot of things.
