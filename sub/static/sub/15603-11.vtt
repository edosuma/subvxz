00:00.984 --> 00:02.596
<i>Previously on</i>
Covert Affairs...

00:02.621 --> 00:04.310
The most pressing matter
for all of us

00:04.311 --> 00:05.929
is operative Annie Walker.

00:05.980 --> 00:08.732
She's off the grid, and European
authorities want her arrested.

00:08.799 --> 00:10.133
And you'll be relieved
of your duties

00:10.184 --> 00:11.901
until an inquest
can be conducted.

00:11.969 --> 00:14.604
Can you get Annie Walker
back on American soil?

00:14.655 --> 00:17.490
Their exfil team point man
has been found shot dead.

00:17.575 --> 00:20.143
We've changed operative Walker's
classification.

00:20.194 --> 00:21.644
She's a rogue operative.

00:21.696 --> 00:24.114
Henry visited a restaurant
and met briefly with a woman.

00:24.165 --> 00:26.449
- That is Jai's mom.
- I'm gonna turn her

00:26.500 --> 00:28.952
and use her as leverage
against Henry.

00:29.003 --> 00:30.683
If you go near his ex-wife,
he'll kill you.

00:30.755 --> 00:32.839
I'm gonna take myself
off the game board.

00:34.175 --> 00:36.659
Operative Walker is dead.

00:36.711 --> 00:38.845
So is this really the end
of Annie Walker?

00:40.798 --> 00:42.382
Yes.

01:04.188 --> 01:06.906
Hey, Michael,
this is Auggie Anderson.

01:06.991 --> 01:08.524
I'm calling for Danielle.

01:11.695 --> 01:13.129
Hey, Danielle.

01:16.366 --> 01:19.135
It's about Annie.

04:10.507 --> 04:12.225
<i>Permis de conduire, s'il vous plait.</i>
I don't speak French.

04:12.309 --> 04:14.978
American.
You come across from Germany?

04:15.045 --> 04:17.096
- Yes.
- Your name.

04:17.180 --> 04:19.714
Jessica Matthews.

04:35.366 --> 04:37.450
The autoroute
is not the autobahn.

04:37.534 --> 04:39.869
40 kilometers
over the speed limit.

04:39.920 --> 04:42.538
Let's not have any more trouble
while you're in Switzerland.

04:42.589 --> 04:44.624
I'll try.

06:42.709 --> 06:45.578
One of you guys Reese?

06:45.662 --> 06:47.196
Who wants to know?

06:47.247 --> 06:49.248
- That apartment still for rent?
- Mm-hmm.

06:49.333 --> 06:51.584
150 a week, in advance.

06:51.668 --> 06:53.169
How much for the month?

06:53.220 --> 06:57.223
Nobody stays a month.

06:57.307 --> 07:00.059
Fine.
We'll do it on a weekly.

07:02.262 --> 07:04.880
- You're serious.
- I'm new in town

07:04.932 --> 07:07.150
and money's tight
and I don't like roommates.

07:07.217 --> 07:10.103
- Drugs?
- No, thanks.

07:10.187 --> 07:12.488
You a party girl?

07:13.857 --> 07:16.442
Forget it, man.

07:16.527 --> 07:18.911
Wait.
Just checking.

07:18.996 --> 07:21.864
Come on.
It's down the block.

07:24.168 --> 07:26.502
Don't bleed him out.
Out the back way.

07:32.576 --> 07:34.510
I'm just next door.

07:34.578 --> 07:36.898
I collect the rent and fix
broken toilets for the landlord,

07:36.930 --> 07:38.381
so he gives me a break.

07:38.432 --> 07:41.300
304 skipped out on the rent
last week.

07:41.385 --> 07:42.885
I can let you have it
for 600 a month.

07:42.936 --> 07:44.854
I'll take it for 500.

07:44.921 --> 07:47.106
That's 500 more
than it's making now.

07:47.191 --> 07:49.442
Welcome to the ungodly
neighborhood.

07:49.526 --> 07:51.427
No one will bother you,
'cause nobody

07:51.478 --> 07:53.779
wants to be bothered.
Sounds perfect.

07:53.864 --> 07:56.983
Have you got a name?

07:57.067 --> 07:59.652
Jessica Matthews.

07:59.736 --> 08:01.270
I dunno, if you ever
want to grab a pint,

08:01.321 --> 08:03.823
there's a pub
on the corner.

08:03.907 --> 08:05.992
Greasy fish and chips
if you're hungry, too.

08:06.076 --> 08:07.743
Sleep first.
But thanks.

08:07.794 --> 08:10.329
I'll call you
when my toilet breaks.

08:18.172 --> 08:20.306
A sudden loss
can make you question

08:20.390 --> 08:22.592
everything about yourself

08:22.643 --> 08:26.262
and change you in ways
you don't even realize.

08:26.313 --> 08:29.682
But talking about it
is the first step.

08:32.436 --> 08:34.437
Tell us why you're here.

08:36.323 --> 08:39.741
My name's Jessica,
and I lost my brother.

08:39.808 --> 08:41.611
Would you like to tell us
about it?

08:41.662 --> 08:42.828
I think it would be helpful

08:42.913 --> 08:44.780
if I heard other people's
stories first.

08:44.831 --> 08:47.500
Anyone?

08:47.584 --> 08:48.951
I'm George.

08:49.002 --> 08:52.455
I lost my wife of 24 years.

08:52.506 --> 08:53.956
Marie.

08:54.007 --> 08:56.042
I lost my mother.

08:56.126 --> 08:57.343
I'm Sana.

08:57.427 --> 08:59.045
I lost my son, Jai.

09:00.764 --> 09:03.015
Does that help you,
Jessica?

09:03.100 --> 09:04.517
The more you understand others,

09:04.601 --> 09:08.854
the closer you are
to healing yourself.

09:08.939 --> 09:11.307
That's exactly why I came.

09:26.711 --> 09:28.602
I don't know
if this is for me?

09:28.603 --> 09:30.320
It's better
once you start to open up,

09:30.388 --> 09:32.556
tell your own story.

09:32.607 --> 09:34.575
Your son sounds like
a good guy.

09:34.659 --> 09:36.226
He was.

09:36.277 --> 09:38.862
Your husband, he doesn't go in
for this therapy stuff?

09:38.913 --> 09:40.531
My husband?

09:40.582 --> 09:42.232
Jai's dad.
He doesn't come with you?

09:42.283 --> 09:45.035
We're no longer married.
Excuse me.

09:51.843 --> 09:53.627
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

09:53.711 --> 09:55.546
- Shouldn't you be resting?
- The doctor says I'm fine.

09:55.597 --> 09:57.914
It was an event,
not a condition.

09:59.183 --> 10:01.218
If something had happened
to you...

10:06.524 --> 10:08.191
I've obtained your release.

10:08.259 --> 10:09.810
As long as you agree
to house arrest

10:09.894 --> 10:11.228
throughout the legal
proceedings,

10:11.279 --> 10:12.529
you can be home with Joan.

10:12.597 --> 10:13.530
Is Joan safe?

10:13.598 --> 10:14.615
Joan was just
following orders

10:14.699 --> 10:16.650
as far as the D.O.J.
is concerned.

10:16.734 --> 10:19.036
You're the only one with direct
ties to Teo and the A.L.C.

10:19.103 --> 10:21.705
Arthur, the Agency has offered
to keep me on

10:21.772 --> 10:23.907
with lower clearance
but full health care.

10:23.975 --> 10:25.609
I hate the idea of you being
in that building

10:25.660 --> 10:27.944
with Braithwaite
and Henry running the show.

10:27.996 --> 10:29.713
I know,
but I've got some leverage.

10:29.780 --> 10:30.998
The Agency doesn't want me
out there

10:31.082 --> 10:32.583
selling the story
to <i>Vanity Fair.</i>

10:32.634 --> 10:34.784
Well, the world needs to know
what Henry's done.

10:34.836 --> 10:36.620
Teo and Annie are dead
because of him.

10:36.671 --> 10:39.056
And that's exactly why I need
to stay in that building.

10:39.123 --> 10:42.175
Braithwaite will marginalize me.
Henry will vilify me.

10:42.260 --> 10:43.760
But I can use
whatever resources I can

10:43.811 --> 10:45.596
to out Henry
and get our lives back.

10:45.647 --> 10:49.132
Our main goal now is to defend
Arthur against these charges,

10:49.183 --> 10:50.984
not counterpunch recklessly.

10:51.069 --> 10:53.353
I'll get your paperwork going.

10:56.107 --> 10:58.075
We've held our vows
to the Agency

10:58.142 --> 11:00.494
above our vows
to each other.

11:00.578 --> 11:02.829
I'm not doing that anymore.

11:02.914 --> 11:06.500
There is nothing more important
to me than you and our baby.

11:06.584 --> 11:08.785
Henry did this.

11:08.836 --> 11:10.420
Henry's going to pay.

11:10.488 --> 11:13.173
Barber, when I get back,

11:13.257 --> 11:15.459
I need those geospatial maps
the N.R.O. sent over.

11:15.510 --> 11:17.794
Yeah.

11:17.845 --> 11:20.013
That ribbon, it's for Annie?

11:20.098 --> 11:22.432
I know the D.C.S. declared
no ribbons,

11:22.500 --> 11:23.850
but she was a friend.

11:23.935 --> 11:26.436
She was a rogue operative
at the time of her death.

11:26.504 --> 11:30.774
With all due respect,
she was still a friend.

11:30.841 --> 11:35.028
I'm not taking it off.

11:35.113 --> 11:38.148
Just have those maps
on my desk.

11:38.199 --> 11:41.151
Yes, sir.

11:43.955 --> 11:45.622
You wanted to see me?

11:45.690 --> 11:47.658
Have a seat.

11:47.709 --> 11:50.527
I saw your after action report
from Frankfurt.

11:50.578 --> 11:52.496
It's a miracle you didn't get
shot yourself.

11:52.547 --> 11:54.197
I like to think of it
as good training, sir.

11:54.248 --> 11:55.499
In any event,
I don't need to tell you

11:55.550 --> 11:57.167
what kind of shit storm
I've been dealing with

11:57.218 --> 11:58.835
since Copenhagen.

11:58.886 --> 12:01.171
But there are gonna be a lot
of changes around here,

12:01.222 --> 12:03.056
starting
with internal security--

12:03.141 --> 12:04.591
continuous background checks,

12:04.676 --> 12:07.511
random polygraphs,
enhanced cyber-measures.

12:07.562 --> 12:08.845
Spying on ourselves.

12:08.896 --> 12:10.981
We can never have anyone
in the Agency

12:11.048 --> 12:12.766
abuse its resources
for personal reasons

12:12.850 --> 12:13.984
the way the Campbells have.

12:14.051 --> 12:16.019
Yes, sir.

12:16.070 --> 12:18.655
Henry, thank you for coming.

12:18.723 --> 12:22.159
I serve when I'm called,
just like Mr. Michaels.

12:22.226 --> 12:24.244
Pleasure to meet you
in person.

12:24.328 --> 12:25.996
Likewise.

12:26.063 --> 12:28.165
Hell of a thing
you had to do.

12:28.232 --> 12:29.783
She left me no choice.

12:29.867 --> 12:31.067
I'd like the two of you
to have

12:31.068 --> 12:32.536
a closer working relationship

12:32.587 --> 12:34.538
now that Lexington Global
will be

12:34.589 --> 12:37.290
a major contractor
here in the building.

12:37.375 --> 12:39.843
You can learn a lot from a man
like Henry Wilcox.

12:39.910 --> 12:41.044
I certainly hope so.

12:41.095 --> 12:42.462
The D.C.I. is expecting us.

12:42.547 --> 12:44.514
Well, let's not keep him
waiting.

12:44.582 --> 12:46.683
I need a quick moment
with Mr. Michaels.

12:46.751 --> 12:49.603
Sure.

12:53.558 --> 12:56.059
I'd just like to clarify
one thing.

12:56.110 --> 12:59.095
What did operative Walker say
before she died?

12:59.147 --> 13:01.231
You heard it all
through the phone, Mr. Wilcox.

13:01.282 --> 13:03.316
Nothing else?

13:03.401 --> 13:05.035
No final whispers?

13:05.102 --> 13:07.070
She pointed her gun at me.

13:07.121 --> 13:09.823
I shot to kill.

13:09.907 --> 13:11.324
No final whispers.

13:11.409 --> 13:14.077
Like I said,
a hell of a thing.

13:14.128 --> 13:15.328
Director Campbell,

13:15.413 --> 13:17.781
it's an honor to have you
in crateology.

13:17.832 --> 13:19.616
How much do you know
about crates?

13:19.667 --> 13:21.835
Well, I've seen my share
of shipments in the field.

13:21.919 --> 13:23.670
And I'm actually not
a director anymore.

13:23.755 --> 13:26.389
Well, you'll pick it up quick.

13:26.457 --> 13:28.642
As we say here,
if it's shaped like a rocket,

13:28.726 --> 13:30.594
it's probably a rocket.

13:30.645 --> 13:31.845
We'll get you your first stack
of photos to analyze

13:31.929 --> 13:33.597
by mid-morning.
Okay.

13:33.648 --> 13:35.599
Here's your office.

13:38.469 --> 13:40.904
Sorry.
If it means anything,

13:40.971 --> 13:42.572
you're giving the department
so much cred

13:42.573 --> 13:44.441
by being here.

13:44.492 --> 13:46.193
Every department matters.

13:46.277 --> 13:47.744
This is gonna be just fine.

13:53.451 --> 13:55.168
You're here to discuss
the particulars

13:55.253 --> 13:56.787
of a classified flash drive
that was found

13:56.838 --> 13:58.655
in your apartment.

13:58.706 --> 14:00.674
Did Annie Walker
give it to you?

14:00.758 --> 14:02.492
I blame her,
and I walk out of here?

14:02.543 --> 14:04.661
If that's what the truth is,
yes.

14:04.712 --> 14:07.714
Let's not kid ourselves.

14:07.799 --> 14:12.001
You don't really care
about the truth.

14:12.053 --> 14:14.855
Once again, the flash drive.

14:14.939 --> 14:16.690
How did you get it?

14:16.774 --> 14:19.693
Did former operative Walker
give it to you?

14:25.950 --> 14:27.734
Good you cooperated,
Anderson.

14:27.819 --> 14:29.486
Getting a fuller picture
on Walker and the flash drive

14:29.537 --> 14:30.487
is important.

14:30.538 --> 14:32.322
Don't even talk to me.

14:32.373 --> 14:36.409
- I'm not the enemy here.
- Really?

14:36.494 --> 14:37.627
I think you are.

14:37.695 --> 14:40.630
Annie Walker died
because she went rogue.

14:40.698 --> 14:42.582
She was not a traitor.

14:42.667 --> 14:45.218
You shot her in cold blood

14:45.303 --> 14:46.219
before she could explain
herself.

14:46.304 --> 14:47.264
That's enough, Anderson.

14:47.338 --> 14:51.308
You did this, Calder,
all of it.

14:51.375 --> 14:56.012
You want to know
why I didn't save her.

14:56.063 --> 14:59.065
Why the hell didn't you?

15:06.056 --> 15:07.324
Anderson!

15:07.391 --> 15:09.743
You make a very convincing
asshole.

15:09.827 --> 15:11.661
You convinced Braithwaite.

15:11.729 --> 15:13.079
Did he tell you where he's
gonna put me?

15:13.164 --> 15:14.831
- Australia desk.
- Get him to put me in I.T.

15:14.899 --> 15:17.901
I can monitor the entire
broadband spectrum from there.

15:17.952 --> 15:19.753
We're not tracking Annie.

15:19.837 --> 15:22.255
Well, you did set up
a communications protocol,

15:22.340 --> 15:24.257
didn't you?
I tried. She refused.

15:24.342 --> 15:26.710
You let her do this
without any way to check in?

15:26.761 --> 15:28.378
You need to separate
how you feel about her

15:28.429 --> 15:29.796
from this mission.

15:29.881 --> 15:31.765
I had to call her sister
and tell her Annie's dead.

15:31.849 --> 15:33.516
That's the toughest call
I've ever had to make.

15:33.584 --> 15:35.302
I procured a dead female
in Frankfurt

15:35.386 --> 15:37.637
and I.D.'d her
as a CIA operative.

15:37.722 --> 15:39.589
I supervised an Air Force crew
as they loaded

15:39.640 --> 15:43.276
that same Jane Doe onto a C-17
in a metal transfer case,

15:43.361 --> 15:44.978
and I approved
the death certificate

15:45.062 --> 15:47.814
as they draped an American flag
over the casket.

15:47.899 --> 15:49.983
How many years do you think
that'll get me?

15:50.067 --> 15:53.486
We can share a cell.

15:53.571 --> 15:55.789
Annie just better come up
with something

15:55.873 --> 15:57.741
on this ex-wife goose chase.

15:57.792 --> 16:00.410
Henry met with his ex-wife
in Frankfurt

16:00.461 --> 16:03.046
the night before he blew up
that chopper.

16:03.113 --> 16:04.164
That is a solid lead.

16:04.248 --> 16:05.569
And we need
to keep moving forward

16:05.583 --> 16:07.250
in case it's not.
You're right.

16:07.301 --> 16:08.251
That's why you're
about to become

16:08.302 --> 16:09.970
Henry's new best friend.

16:10.054 --> 16:11.504
As far as he's concerned,
you killed Annie.

16:11.589 --> 16:12.589
I can't think
of a better entree.

16:12.640 --> 16:13.790
It's already in motion.

16:13.841 --> 16:15.601
Braithwaite wants me working
closer with him.

16:15.643 --> 16:17.644
Congratulations, you're
about to become a double.

16:17.728 --> 16:20.647
Yeah, and I'll get you
into I.T.

16:24.485 --> 16:26.770
After three weeks, I was
hoping that Jessica would be

16:26.821 --> 16:29.406
comfortable enough to open
today's session.

16:29.473 --> 16:33.193
I think it would be very helpful
for all of us to hear her story.

16:33.277 --> 16:36.279
Are you ready for that,
Jessica?

16:36.330 --> 16:38.481
I don't know.

16:38.532 --> 16:42.168
Why don't you start by telling
us your brother's name?

16:42.253 --> 16:45.755
Only if you're ready.

16:45.823 --> 16:49.542
Theo.

16:49.627 --> 16:51.327
His name's Theo.

16:51.379 --> 16:55.632
What do you remember
about him most?

16:55.683 --> 16:58.134
His courage.

16:58.185 --> 17:02.005
What were the circumstances
of his death?

17:02.056 --> 17:04.557
He was framed
for a terrible crime,

17:04.642 --> 17:08.862
and he was shot while trying
to get away.

17:08.945 --> 17:12.348
Closure in premature loss
is important.

17:12.400 --> 17:16.019
Was the person responsible
for his death caught?

17:16.069 --> 17:17.203
Not yet.

17:17.288 --> 17:18.621
How do you feel about that?

17:18.689 --> 17:20.740
How the hell do you think
I feel?

17:20.825 --> 17:24.327
You're angry.

17:24.377 --> 17:27.547
I

17:27.631 --> 17:29.249
I tried to do something,
but I couldn't--

17:29.333 --> 17:31.134
I couldn't help him.

17:31.201 --> 17:32.335
You feel responsible.

17:32.386 --> 17:33.803
Of course.

17:33.871 --> 17:36.139
Someone else killed
your brother,

17:36.206 --> 17:38.641
but you feel
it is your fault.

17:38.709 --> 17:40.093
I let myself get manipulated,

17:40.177 --> 17:42.595
and my brother had to pay
for it.

17:42.680 --> 17:44.898
But this anger that you feel,

17:44.982 --> 17:48.601
is it toward yourself?

17:48.686 --> 17:50.687
You know what,
I don't think I can, um--

17:50.738 --> 17:53.773
I don't want
to do this anymore.

17:53.858 --> 17:57.077
My son was 33.

17:57.161 --> 18:01.247
Jai was 33.

18:01.332 --> 18:04.534
How old was your brother?

18:04.585 --> 18:07.537
Uh, 32.

18:16.152 --> 18:17.717
We have
a complicated relationship.

18:17.718 --> 18:19.652
Everyone's parents are
complicated.

18:19.719 --> 18:22.238
Losing a child can be very hard
on a marriage.

18:22.322 --> 18:24.740
Is that what happened with you
and Jai's dad?

18:24.825 --> 18:27.527
Why do you keep asking me
about him?

18:27.578 --> 18:29.745
Like I said,
my boyfriend and me--

18:29.830 --> 18:32.081
I'm just trying
to figure things out.

18:32.166 --> 18:35.234
It doesn't sound like
you guys did.

18:35.285 --> 18:37.670
Henry and I divorced
when Jai was only 11.

18:37.737 --> 18:39.255
He worked in a world

18:39.339 --> 18:43.576
that I didn't want my son
exposed to.

18:43.627 --> 18:45.878
In the end,
I couldn't stop it.

18:45.946 --> 18:48.414
Do you guys still talk?
I mean, are you friendly?

18:48.465 --> 18:50.416
I cut off ties for years.

18:50.467 --> 18:52.418
But then a few weeks ago,
he was in Europe,

18:52.469 --> 18:55.271
and he said wanted to see me.

18:55.355 --> 18:57.640
It was--

18:57.724 --> 18:58.858
Complicated.

18:58.925 --> 19:00.276
Ah.

19:00.360 --> 19:02.562
Has the university
accepted your transfer?

19:02.613 --> 19:03.980
They said next semester.

19:04.064 --> 19:05.198
Well, you're gonna need
a work permit

19:05.265 --> 19:06.732
if you want to stay here
till then.

19:06.783 --> 19:08.117
Yeah, except I can't find
a job.

19:08.202 --> 19:09.768
Let me talk to my fiance,
David.

19:09.820 --> 19:11.237
I'm sure there's something you
could do for us at the office.

19:11.288 --> 19:12.955
Oh, no, no, no.
No, I couldn't--

19:13.040 --> 19:16.125
No, please, let me.

19:16.210 --> 19:18.911
I didn't start over on my own,
you know.

19:18.962 --> 19:20.830
And it makes me happy to feel
a little bit

19:20.914 --> 19:22.748
like a mother again.

19:22.799 --> 19:24.884
But we're going
to have to find you

19:24.951 --> 19:27.720
something different to wear.

19:52.779 --> 19:56.532
Hello, Jessica.

19:59.286 --> 20:00.819
- Hey.
- Did you hear that?

20:00.871 --> 20:02.205
Hear what?

20:02.289 --> 20:04.757
It's the pub.
It's calling your name.

20:04.824 --> 20:06.375
It's probably tired
of calling yours.

20:06.460 --> 20:08.661
Good one.

20:08.712 --> 20:13.432
Hey.
That's a fancy scarf.

20:13.500 --> 20:16.936
- A friend took me shopping.
- Sugar daddy?

20:17.003 --> 20:18.671
She's trying to help me get
a job.

20:18.722 --> 20:22.024
So no--no boyfriend then?

20:22.109 --> 20:25.311
- No.
- Then you can invite me in.

20:25.362 --> 20:28.564
You've spent every night alone
for over a month.

20:28.649 --> 20:30.900
A human can't stay human
very long like that.

20:30.984 --> 20:33.018
Hell is other people.

20:33.070 --> 20:34.403
Sartre, right?

20:36.073 --> 20:37.490
You're too smart
for your own good.

20:37.541 --> 20:40.493
So I've been told.

20:43.029 --> 20:45.381
My medical background got me
my first consulting job

20:45.465 --> 20:46.666
several years ago.

20:46.717 --> 20:50.002
I met David at a seminar.
He hired me.

20:50.053 --> 20:54.206
And now I'm just a romantic
cliche, marrying the boss.

20:54.258 --> 20:55.207
David.

20:55.259 --> 20:56.559
Ah, bonjour, cherie.

20:56.643 --> 20:58.511
This is Jessica.
I told you about her last night.

20:58.562 --> 21:00.479
No, no, no.
The Norwegians are waiting.

21:00.547 --> 21:01.480
Then I have the eco-investors.

21:01.548 --> 21:05.434
Just let her impress you.

21:05.519 --> 21:06.819
<i>Bon, d'accord.</i>

21:06.886 --> 21:10.406
Walk with me, Jessica.

21:10.490 --> 21:12.525
My future wife seems to have
taken you under her wing.

21:12.576 --> 21:13.526
She's very kind.

21:13.577 --> 21:15.027
Yes, she is.

21:15.078 --> 21:17.246
I'm about to walk into a roomful
of Norwegians who want me

21:17.331 --> 21:19.081
to invest in their
oil tankers.

21:19.166 --> 21:20.082
Yes or no?

21:20.167 --> 21:22.918
The ice caps are melting.

21:23.003 --> 21:24.754
Are you looking
for a donation?

21:24.838 --> 21:26.255
I'm talking
about shipping lanes.

21:26.340 --> 21:27.957
China will have their own
through the North Pole

21:28.041 --> 21:29.792
within five years.

21:29.876 --> 21:32.795
They've already spoken with
Iceland and Canada about it.

21:32.879 --> 21:34.580
The Norwegians will be
on the outside, looking in.

21:34.631 --> 21:36.015
So you say no.

21:36.082 --> 21:39.101
- You asked for my opinion.
- I'm so used to yes-men.

21:39.186 --> 21:41.971
You caught me by surprise.

21:42.055 --> 21:43.856
A risky business,
being honest.

21:43.923 --> 21:46.058
I'm not afraid
of taking risks.

21:46.109 --> 21:48.227
My analysis as well,
by the way.

21:48.278 --> 21:51.113
There's another deal
I'd like your opinion on,

21:51.198 --> 21:52.765
an American real estate
development.

21:52.816 --> 21:54.650
Have Sana give you the file.

21:54.735 --> 21:56.152
Does that mean--

21:56.236 --> 21:59.822
I'll expect
your thoughts by Monday.

21:59.906 --> 22:01.957
<i>Bonjour, tout le monde.</i>
<i>Please, have a seat.</i>

22:02.042 --> 22:04.493
Sorry I'm late.

22:06.880 --> 22:08.881
Hey, Michael,
double espresso, extra-hot.

22:08.948 --> 22:09.882
On me.

22:09.949 --> 22:12.551
It's an honor, sir.

22:12.619 --> 22:14.220
It's a cup of coffee.

22:14.287 --> 22:18.007
You know, I was hoping to pick
your brain about cyber-security.

22:18.091 --> 22:19.809
I've been asked to beef up
our D.P.D. firewalls,

22:19.893 --> 22:21.143
especially from the inside.

22:21.228 --> 22:25.514
Who watches the watchers?
Always a conundrum.

22:25.599 --> 22:26.849
I know our new D.C.S.

22:26.933 --> 22:29.151
wants us to have a closer
working relationship.

22:29.236 --> 22:31.687
I'm sure there are
state-of-the-art systems

22:31.772 --> 22:32.855
at Lexington Global.

22:32.939 --> 22:34.323
Oh, better than
state-of-the-art.

22:34.408 --> 22:36.359
I'm not strangled
by government purse strings

22:36.443 --> 22:37.943
in the private sector.

22:37.994 --> 22:39.311
Okay, why don't you
show me what you've got

22:39.363 --> 22:40.780
and see if I can use it here?

22:40.831 --> 22:44.033
How about we get to know each
other a little better first?

22:44.117 --> 22:45.951
Lunch at
the Metropolitan Club.

22:46.002 --> 22:48.003
I find it takes years
of business meetings

22:48.088 --> 22:51.040
to learn the kinds of things
that a few martinis

22:51.124 --> 22:52.375
can bring about in one meal.

22:52.459 --> 22:56.662
We can talk about
cyber-security,

22:56.713 --> 22:59.465
or whatever else
might really be on your mind.

22:59.516 --> 23:03.969
I'll have my office
set it up.

23:04.020 --> 23:06.188
You know, I thought
I could handle this.

23:06.273 --> 23:08.524
But seeing
the two of them together,

23:08.608 --> 23:10.893
it takes everything I have
not to scream right now.

23:10.977 --> 23:14.280
Let's walk it off.

23:14.347 --> 23:16.682
They say
when you're pregnant,

23:16.733 --> 23:18.701
the hormones change
the way you feel,

23:18.785 --> 23:22.154
but I think it's
simpler than that.

23:22.205 --> 23:23.445
I think
they help you understand

23:23.457 --> 23:27.410
what's important
and what isn't.

23:27.494 --> 23:30.162
I hope she knew
how I felt about her.

23:30.213 --> 23:34.049
She did.

23:34.134 --> 23:36.051
She deserves
a star on this wall.

23:36.136 --> 23:39.472
And Arthur deserves
to be home to raise his son.

24:08.919 --> 24:10.669
I need three bound
and collated copies

24:10.737 --> 24:14.673
for the meeting, please.

24:56.082 --> 24:58.717
What are you doing in here?

24:58.785 --> 25:01.003
Last minute figures
for the real estate development.

25:01.087 --> 25:02.471
My computer
doesn't have access.

25:02.556 --> 25:04.076
Not to worry,
we have the horse's mouth

25:04.090 --> 25:05.558
in the conference room.

25:05.625 --> 25:07.810
Walk with me.

25:07.894 --> 25:10.896
<i>Allez, allez.</i>

25:10.964 --> 25:13.682
My American liaison arrived
unexpectedly with a time clock.

25:13.767 --> 25:16.134
I want you in the meeting,
a friendly American face.

25:16.186 --> 25:17.853
Oh, what's the clock?

25:17.938 --> 25:20.138
48 hours before he opens it up
to the other funds,

25:20.190 --> 25:22.408
because he owes me
for a tip that went bad,

25:22.475 --> 25:24.610
a Colombian oil company
that was making a lot of money

25:24.661 --> 25:26.195
before that
Copenhagen incident.

25:26.279 --> 25:29.748
- He put you on to Solstar?
- Mm-hmm.

25:29.816 --> 25:31.200
Ah, Andrew Goodman, <i>bienvenue.</i>
<i>Welcome.</i>

25:31.284 --> 25:33.953
Oh, <i>merci.</i>

25:54.093 --> 25:56.228
Now, Mr. Goodman,
please enlighten us

25:56.312 --> 25:58.980
on how much money Nags Head
Estates is going to make for us.

25:59.048 --> 26:02.234
Over 600 prime waterfront
acres with the most

26:02.318 --> 26:05.187
breathtaking Atlantic views
on the Outer Banks,

26:05.238 --> 26:09.941
one of America's most
exclusive destinations.

26:10.026 --> 26:13.829
I've prepared a deck so that you
can see for yourself

26:13.896 --> 26:18.083
just how lucky we are
to have acquired this location.

26:18.167 --> 26:23.004
Let's lower the lights.
Jessica, do you mind?

26:23.072 --> 26:25.073
I'm sorry.
I didn't catch your full name.

26:25.124 --> 26:28.376
Jessica Matthews,
our new American analyst.

26:28.427 --> 26:29.627
She isn't afraid
to take risks.

26:29.679 --> 26:32.297
You don't say.

26:36.185 --> 26:37.585
I'm here to
make sure Mr. Dupres

26:37.637 --> 26:39.771
doesn't take
any unnecessary ones.

26:39.856 --> 26:42.524
Maybe you could answer
a question for all of us,

26:42.591 --> 26:45.026
regarding the backer
of your investment.

26:45.094 --> 26:46.311
I've gone through
all the paperwork.

26:46.395 --> 26:49.898
And there are no names,
only an L.L.C.

26:51.901 --> 26:56.571
Who are you representing,
Mr. Goodman?

26:56.622 --> 27:00.575
Why doesn't your backer
want us to know who he is?

27:00.626 --> 27:04.045
I can't imagine
Mr. Goodman would have a problem

27:04.113 --> 27:05.747
telling us that,
now would you, Mr. Goodman?

27:05.798 --> 27:07.666
Not at all.

27:07.750 --> 27:10.085
I'd be happy to contact
my boss right away.

27:10.136 --> 27:12.787
I'm sure he'd be very interested
to know that you have

27:12.838 --> 27:15.340
such a knowledgeable
analyst on your staff.

27:15.424 --> 27:19.561
But I'd like to make
that call in private.

27:23.465 --> 27:24.399
I believe you have
spooked him.

27:24.466 --> 27:27.736
I'll go smooth things over.

27:29.488 --> 27:33.858
Why don't we all
take a break?

28:56.942 --> 28:59.527
- I'm meeting Henry at his club.
- Great.

28:59.578 --> 29:01.496
Tell me about his relationship
with Braithwaite.

29:01.563 --> 29:03.415
Is Henry calling the shots?

29:03.499 --> 29:04.532
From what I've seen,
Henry's treating the office

29:04.583 --> 29:05.867
of the D.C.S.
as if it's his own.

29:05.918 --> 29:07.735
Braithwaite won't make
a move without his say-so.

29:07.787 --> 29:09.004
Good, maybe there's room.

29:09.071 --> 29:11.289
- For what?
- A wedge.

29:11.374 --> 29:12.707
It's Henry's favorite tool.

29:12.758 --> 29:15.043
The best way to knock your
opponent off-kilter

29:15.094 --> 29:18.596
is to make him uncertain
about the people he trusts most.

29:18.681 --> 29:20.765
He tried to put one
between Annie and me.

29:20.850 --> 29:22.050
And you think
we should put one

29:22.084 --> 29:23.551
between Braithwaite and Henry.
Damn straight.

29:23.602 --> 29:25.303
It's too quick.

29:25.388 --> 29:27.388
Let me get closer to him,
figure out his next move.

29:27.390 --> 29:28.723
No, we need to attack.

29:28.774 --> 29:30.525
I think it's about time
Eric Braithwaite asked you

29:30.592 --> 29:33.111
to open a blue file
into Henry Wilcox.

29:33.195 --> 29:35.030
Braithwaite
is not gonna approve

29:35.097 --> 29:36.531
an inquiry into
Henry's dealings.

29:36.598 --> 29:38.066
Doesn't have to.

29:38.117 --> 29:41.119
Henry just has to
believe he did.

30:40.662 --> 30:42.330
Who are you?

30:45.661 --> 30:46.566
I guarantee you,

30:46.567 --> 30:48.073
this guy was sent here
to hurt you.

30:48.074 --> 30:49.553
His name is
not Andrew Goodman.

30:49.554 --> 30:51.141
He works for Henry Wilcox.

30:51.142 --> 30:51.977
So do you.

30:51.978 --> 30:53.111
If that's true,
why am I bleeding?

30:53.179 --> 30:55.197
And why is he in the trunk?

30:55.281 --> 30:56.481
- Is he dead?
- No.

30:56.532 --> 30:58.033
But we have to get
out of here

30:58.117 --> 30:59.284
unless you want David
to find out.

30:59.352 --> 31:00.736
No.

31:00.820 --> 31:03.021
Then shoot me
or get in the car.

31:14.033 --> 31:15.751
You have that gun because
you're afraid of Henry.

31:15.835 --> 31:18.303
I have the guns
so I can ask the questions.

31:18.371 --> 31:19.338
Who are you?

31:19.389 --> 31:20.389
You don't need
to know who I am,

31:20.473 --> 31:21.539
just that we're
on the same side.

31:21.591 --> 31:22.924
I knew you were
in the game

31:23.009 --> 31:24.009
the minute
you mentioned Henry

31:24.060 --> 31:25.427
that first night
after therapy.

31:25.511 --> 31:28.013
Henry destroyed my life
and the people I care about.

31:28.064 --> 31:29.214
So if you don't
want to be next,

31:29.265 --> 31:31.016
you're gonna start
trusting me right now.

31:31.067 --> 31:34.069
I don't have to trust anything
or anyone from the CIA.

31:34.153 --> 31:36.154
The CIA doesn't
know I'm here.

31:36.222 --> 31:37.189
Neither does Henry.

31:37.240 --> 31:38.357
I don't believe you.

31:38.408 --> 31:40.659
You know too much about me,
about Jai.

31:40.726 --> 31:44.729
You trafficked in my loss,
pretending to have a brother.

31:44.781 --> 31:46.114
That loss was real.

31:46.199 --> 31:49.034
An operative I was close with
died because of Henry.

31:49.085 --> 31:51.620
So if you think this isn't
personal, then think again.

31:51.704 --> 31:53.005
Now I need you to tell me
what Henry said to you

31:53.072 --> 31:54.423
at that dinner in Frankfurt.

31:54.507 --> 31:56.758
The day after he met you,
he had the guy in the trunk

31:56.843 --> 31:59.011
shoot down that chopper
in Copenhagen.

31:59.078 --> 32:00.412
And you think
I'm involved?

32:00.463 --> 32:02.514
No, but I think
you are smart enough

32:02.581 --> 32:04.082
to help me take Henry down.

32:06.102 --> 32:08.353
Sana, Jai was my friend.

32:08.421 --> 32:10.472
We worked together
for two years.

32:10.556 --> 32:11.923
I lost him, too.

32:11.974 --> 32:14.643
He was always torn between
wanting to please his father

32:14.727 --> 32:16.428
and hating his methods.

32:16.479 --> 32:19.031
But you and I,
we're not torn.

32:19.098 --> 32:20.232
Help me.

32:20.283 --> 32:22.734
Tell me what Henry said
to you in Frankfurt.

32:24.904 --> 32:27.406
He said he'd always
loved me,

32:27.457 --> 32:29.958
and that after Jai died,
he had no one.

32:30.043 --> 32:33.128
So he wanted to win me back,
convince me he was a good man

32:33.212 --> 32:34.212
and that David wasn't.

32:34.280 --> 32:36.131
He made up
this ridiculous story

32:36.215 --> 32:38.834
that David had financial ties
to nefarious groups.

32:38.918 --> 32:40.302
David would never do that.

32:40.386 --> 32:42.254
So you told him
you didn't believe him,

32:42.305 --> 32:43.288
and that you and David
were engaged.

32:43.339 --> 32:44.639
He got angry.

32:44.724 --> 32:47.309
And then when you showed up,
I figured he'd sent you.

32:47.393 --> 32:49.177
And you became
my new best friend.

32:49.262 --> 32:50.896
Friends close,
enemies closer.

32:50.963 --> 32:52.264
Isn't that the rule?

32:52.315 --> 32:54.433
I learned a lot about
his methods in eleven years.

32:55.651 --> 32:57.469
I think Henry
wants to set David up

32:57.520 --> 32:59.521
to get him out of the picture
and win you back.

32:59.605 --> 33:00.739
If you want to help him,

33:00.806 --> 33:02.640
you need to stop
treating me like the enemy,

33:02.692 --> 33:04.693
because the enemy is
waking up in the trunk.

33:19.325 --> 33:20.375
Close the gate.

33:40.513 --> 33:42.781
Help!

33:42.848 --> 33:44.768
This should knock him out
for about half an hour.

33:44.817 --> 33:46.485
You might want to have
that gun ready.

34:03.302 --> 34:06.704
And that's really how
we got Noriega to the states.

34:07.840 --> 34:09.724
You really
have seen it all.

34:09.809 --> 34:12.677
You'll see it, too.

34:12.728 --> 34:14.596
Well,
I only can hope my career

34:14.679 --> 34:16.231
is half as illustrious
as yours.

34:16.315 --> 34:19.234
I'd skip the federal
prison part if I were you.

34:21.853 --> 34:23.054
Hey, no more for me.

34:23.105 --> 34:24.940
You're allowed to let loose
once in a while,

34:25.024 --> 34:26.408
especially with friends.

34:26.492 --> 34:29.360
I've learned enough about you
today to count you as one.

34:29.411 --> 34:32.998
That means a lot.

34:33.065 --> 34:36.734
So... why don't you
stop kissing my ass now

34:36.786 --> 34:39.538
and tell me what you really
want to know.

34:39.589 --> 34:41.422
You lobbied for me
to get my job.

34:41.507 --> 34:42.924
Let's talk about that.

34:43.009 --> 34:44.926
I recommended you
at the highest levels.

34:45.011 --> 34:47.179
Why? We had never even met.

34:47.246 --> 34:49.264
Your reputation
preceded you.

34:49.348 --> 34:51.748
I thought Langley
needed fresh blood.

34:51.801 --> 34:54.268
I could see that you
fit the bill,

34:54.353 --> 34:55.637
even from a distance.

34:59.025 --> 35:01.693
But there's
something else.

35:01.760 --> 35:05.263
Whatever we say
stays between us.

35:11.537 --> 35:14.990
The D.C.S. asked me
to start a file on you,

35:15.074 --> 35:17.442
a blue file.

35:17.493 --> 35:19.211
Braithwaite
is investigating me.

35:19.278 --> 35:20.962
He asked me to do it.

35:21.047 --> 35:24.332
Yeah, so I wouldn't
find out it was him.

35:27.837 --> 35:30.672
This will stay between us.

35:30.756 --> 35:32.307
Yes, sir.

35:33.926 --> 35:35.510
- Are you in?
- Yeah.

35:35.595 --> 35:36.928
What the hell is going on?

35:36.979 --> 35:39.314
Everything's fine.
I just need to get him inside.

35:40.966 --> 35:43.068
- Who is he?
- He's my ex-boyfriend.

35:43.135 --> 35:44.686
He found me.

35:44.770 --> 35:45.987
Is he what you're
running away from?

35:46.072 --> 35:47.305
He got drunk,
and there was a fight.

35:47.356 --> 35:49.357
He just needs to sleep it off.

35:49.442 --> 35:51.142
Did he hurt you?

35:51.193 --> 35:52.861
The mother--
No, no.

35:52.945 --> 35:54.246
No, no,
I've watched my mother

35:54.313 --> 35:56.073
take too many blows
from my step-dad before--

35:56.115 --> 35:57.365
You're only
gonna make things worse.

35:57.450 --> 35:59.334
I promise, I can handle him.

35:59.418 --> 36:01.703
And I know you don't
need the trouble.

36:04.707 --> 36:06.291
All right.

36:06.342 --> 36:09.294
I'll be at the parlor
if you need me, all right?

36:09.345 --> 36:11.129
Okay?

36:19.188 --> 36:22.140
We have to tie him up
to something.

36:22.191 --> 36:23.525
Maybe this chair.

36:23.609 --> 36:25.110
Your neighbor,
he saw me.

36:28.030 --> 36:31.783
We need to tie him
to the chair.

36:31.850 --> 36:32.984
Then what?

36:33.035 --> 36:34.185
What are you going
to do to him?

36:34.236 --> 36:35.453
He can connect Henry
to the crimes.

36:35.521 --> 36:37.489
So I'm going
to make him talk.

36:39.816 --> 36:41.484
What if
he doesn't cooperate?

36:41.485 --> 36:42.485
That's not gonna
be an option.

36:42.570 --> 36:44.070
We can't just
keep him here like this.

36:44.121 --> 36:45.405
We'll figure something out.

36:45.456 --> 36:48.324
- You're going to kill him.
- No. I need him alive.

36:48.409 --> 36:49.743
But you're going
to hurt him.

36:49.794 --> 36:52.295
If you want someone to blame
for this, blame Henry.

36:52.380 --> 36:53.997
But right now I need you
in the bedroom

36:54.081 --> 36:55.882
so I can do what
I have to do.

36:55.949 --> 37:00.253
If this man sees you with me,
you and David are dead.

37:00.304 --> 37:02.505
Do you understand?

37:58.495 --> 38:00.613
Who are you?

38:00.698 --> 38:02.498
My name is
Andrew Goodman.

38:02.566 --> 38:05.535
No, it's not.

38:05.586 --> 38:07.954
Why did Henry Wilcox
send you here?

38:08.038 --> 38:10.957
Who's Henry Wilcox?

38:17.464 --> 38:20.082
You know, if you were
any good at this,

38:20.134 --> 38:22.218
one of my fingers
would already be gone.

38:22.269 --> 38:23.936
Too much blood.

38:24.021 --> 38:26.305
This only ends one way.

38:26.390 --> 38:28.758
You've got to
push me to the brink

38:28.809 --> 38:31.394
before you're even
close to breaking me.

38:31.445 --> 38:33.730
Then we'll push each other
to our limits.

38:33.781 --> 38:35.815
Then one of us
will make a mistake.

38:35.899 --> 38:38.201
If it's me,
you'll have to kill me.

38:38.268 --> 38:40.787
If it's you--

38:44.107 --> 38:46.459
I'm already dead.

38:49.228 --> 38:50.779
Anderson.

38:53.717 --> 38:55.752
How did your date go?

38:55.803 --> 38:58.638
We are moving on to the next
phase of our relationship.

38:58.722 --> 39:00.036
He buy the blue file story?

39:00.037 --> 39:01.538
Completely.
Now it's your turn.

39:01.605 --> 39:04.941
It's the CIA.
Propaganda is what we do.

39:05.135 --> 39:07.637
The whisper campaign
starts tomorrow.

39:07.721 --> 39:10.056
I hope you have as many
friends as you think you do,

39:10.107 --> 39:12.441
or I'm the first one
to go down in flames.

39:12.526 --> 39:14.277
I've banked a lot of capital
with people in Langley.

39:14.361 --> 39:15.895
They trust me.

39:15.946 --> 39:18.281
Now you have to trust me.

39:19.733 --> 39:22.318
What are you doing
in Geneva?

39:22.402 --> 39:24.287
That's too general.

39:24.371 --> 39:28.624
Pain-induced questioning
should be very specific.

39:28.709 --> 39:30.943
Henry ordered
that helicopter shot down.

39:30.994 --> 39:32.128
And you were the one
that fired the missile.

39:32.212 --> 39:33.880
That's not even a question.

39:33.947 --> 39:35.164
No, no, no.

39:36.583 --> 39:38.084
What are you planning
on doing to David Dupres?

39:38.135 --> 39:41.003
You really have not thought
this through, have you?

39:48.345 --> 39:51.347
You know,
I am such a good resource.

39:51.431 --> 39:55.151
It is a shame that you are
squandering this opportunity.

40:00.807 --> 40:05.444
In order to beat him
you have to become him.

40:05.495 --> 40:07.530
And that's not you,
is it, Miss Walker?

40:07.614 --> 40:10.533
I'm no longer Miss Walker,
remember?

40:21.628 --> 40:22.962
Here's where you're thinking,

40:23.013 --> 40:25.848
"how much current
is too much current?"

40:25.933 --> 40:27.266
You're thinking,

40:27.334 --> 40:29.268
"will I get shocked
if I don't let go in time?"

40:29.336 --> 40:32.188
Here's where you're thinking,

40:32.272 --> 40:33.773
"where is this gonna
to hurt the most?

40:33.840 --> 40:39.145
And why am I sacrificing myself
for Henry Wilcox?"

40:39.196 --> 40:43.849
Even if I scream out what you
want to hear just before I die,

40:43.900 --> 40:45.201
you still won't
be able to stop him.

40:45.285 --> 40:46.619
Stop him from doing what?

40:46.686 --> 40:49.071
What is he gonna do
to David Dupres?

40:49.156 --> 40:51.657
Whatever he wants.

40:51.708 --> 40:53.159
Why are you still
holding the cord?

40:53.210 --> 40:54.710
Why haven't you
put it in the water?

40:54.795 --> 40:55.711
Because you're weak!

40:55.796 --> 40:57.630
Just like David Dupres
is weak!

40:57.697 --> 41:00.216
Tell her. Tell her what he's
going to do to David.

41:00.300 --> 41:01.250
- Sana. Sana!
- I'll kill you myself.

41:01.335 --> 41:04.553
Sana, don't.

41:34.567 --> 41:37.286
You're bleeding.

41:37.371 --> 41:39.288
It's not my blood.

41:50.684 --> 41:52.685
We have to get out of here.

41:52.752 --> 41:56.105
Sana, we have to wipe
this place down
