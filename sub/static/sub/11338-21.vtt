00:05.905 --> 00:07.205
Ugh! Good job today, Brenda.

00:07.206 --> 00:09.774
Thanks, Keith.
This was a great haul.

00:09.775 --> 00:11.876
Yeah. They were really biting today.
It's been a while.

00:11.877 --> 00:13.336
Why don't you
head back to town.

00:13.337 --> 00:14.933
I want to put the rest
in the smoker.

00:14.934 --> 00:16.595
I'll drop you off.

00:16.596 --> 00:18.028
No. I could do
with the walk.

00:18.029 --> 00:19.293
Get home to your wife.

00:19.294 --> 00:21.856
You sure? Lisa wouldn't mind
if I waited for you.

00:21.857 --> 00:24.198
I'll be fine.
Go home.

00:24.199 --> 00:26.601
All right, well,
don't stay too late, all right?

00:26.602 --> 00:28.070
Ok. I'll see you tomorrow.

00:28.071 --> 00:29.711
All right. See you.

00:31.000 --> 00:37.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:40.946 --> 00:43.218
Is anyone there?

00:45.588 --> 00:47.423
"is anyone there," Brenda?

00:47.424 --> 00:50.391
Right. 'cause the homicidal
maniac hiding in the shadows

00:50.392 --> 00:52.824
Is really going to answer you.

01:00.933 --> 01:03.036
Keith?

01:03.037 --> 01:06.372
Stop messing around.
It's not funny.

01:37.566 --> 01:38.600
Oh!

01:38.601 --> 01:40.369
Oh, it's you.

01:40.370 --> 01:42.504
I thought someone was--

01:44.875 --> 01:46.342
Ohh!

01:53.818 --> 01:55.720
JJ, that's not the point.

01:55.721 --> 01:57.422
Well, are you gonna call him?

01:57.423 --> 01:58.489
Maybe.

01:58.490 --> 02:00.558
Emily.

02:00.559 --> 02:03.863
Mick Rawson is an arrogant,

02:03.864 --> 02:06.132
Oversexed, egotistical--

02:06.133 --> 02:10.870
Hot British dude with a sexy
accent, badge, and gun.

02:10.871 --> 02:12.738
Just your type.
Ugh.

02:12.739 --> 02:14.306
You know what? I don't
even get you sometimes.

02:14.307 --> 02:15.608
Sorry.

02:15.609 --> 02:16.742
It wouldn't go anywhere.

02:16.743 --> 02:17.710
You don't know that.

02:17.711 --> 02:19.179
I know our work schedules.

02:19.180 --> 02:21.747
Ok, you know what?
Will and I make it work.

02:21.748 --> 02:22.748
Oh.

02:22.749 --> 02:24.382
Oh, no.

02:25.551 --> 02:27.519
I know. I know. I know.
Don't say it.

02:27.520 --> 02:28.953
But when you see
what's in here...

02:28.954 --> 02:30.021
And it's not my fault.

02:30.022 --> 02:31.856
They were calling
to me, I swear.

02:31.857 --> 02:33.457
And they were all on sale.

02:33.458 --> 02:35.860
And when you think about it, that
means that I am helping the economy,

02:35.861 --> 02:37.461
Which is more than
I can say for you guys,

02:37.462 --> 02:38.795
'cause no one else has bags.

02:38.796 --> 02:41.298
Yeah. Please tell me all of
those aren't for my son.

02:41.299 --> 02:42.867
They're not.
Good.

02:42.868 --> 02:45.403
This one is for Kevin.

02:46.605 --> 02:49.073
What? It is my duty
as a fairy godmother

02:49.074 --> 02:50.342
To spoil the child.

02:50.343 --> 02:51.477
And Henry is finally old enough

02:51.478 --> 02:52.744
To be fun when
opening presents.

02:52.745 --> 02:54.012
I'm not taking them back.

02:54.013 --> 02:56.415
Give me my coffee and no
one's gonna get hurt.

02:56.416 --> 03:00.052
Oh, uh, half-caf extra
shot venti, 2-pump nonfat,

03:00.053 --> 03:01.621
Hold the whip
caramel macchiato.

03:01.622 --> 03:03.457
Mm-hmm.
Next stop, Xanadu.

03:03.458 --> 03:05.392
oh, wait.

03:05.393 --> 03:07.494
Uh...Xana-don't.

03:07.495 --> 03:09.596
Time to go to the ball, ladies.

03:10.932 --> 03:14.634
Maybe I should get a cat.

03:16.037 --> 03:17.504
Whoa!

03:17.505 --> 03:19.772
Sorry to ruin your night.

03:19.773 --> 03:21.274
What, are you working
on wife number 4?

03:21.275 --> 03:23.709
I see you people way too much.

03:23.710 --> 03:25.377
Let's get started.

03:25.378 --> 03:27.746
All right. Anchorage
field office is asking us

03:27.747 --> 03:30.648
To investigate a series of
murders in Franklin, Alaska.

03:30.649 --> 03:32.316
There's 3 people dead
in less than a week.

03:32.317 --> 03:34.118
For a town with
a population of 1,476,

03:34.119 --> 03:35.786
That's fairly significant.

03:35.787 --> 03:37.621
It's their first murder
investigation on record.

03:37.622 --> 03:38.656
Who are the victims?

03:38.657 --> 03:41.025
Uh, Jon Baker, a hunter.

03:41.026 --> 03:43.260
Dedaimia Swanson,
a schoolteacher.

03:43.261 --> 03:45.263
Brenda bright, the first mate
on a fishing boat.

03:45.264 --> 03:47.231
There's a new victim
every 2 days.

03:47.232 --> 03:48.199
Any connections?

03:48.200 --> 03:49.734
Unfortunately,
in a town this small,

03:49.735 --> 03:52.036
Everyone's connected.
Different kill methods.

03:52.037 --> 03:53.204
It says the first two victims

03:53.205 --> 03:54.372
Were both shot with a rifle,

03:54.373 --> 03:56.107
But Brenda bright was
stabbed twice with an arrow?

03:56.108 --> 03:57.509
Are we sure it's the same guy?

03:57.510 --> 03:59.544
All 3 victims were found
in heavily trafficked areas.

03:59.545 --> 04:01.779
The unsub wants them found
sooner than later.

04:01.780 --> 04:03.948
Jon Baker's body was left
exposed to the elements,

04:03.949 --> 04:07.451
But the two women were buried
under mounds of trash. Why?

04:07.452 --> 04:08.653
It could be a sign of remorse.

04:08.654 --> 04:10.054
Cover their bodies so
he doesn't have to face

04:10.055 --> 04:11.121
The reality of what he's done.

04:11.122 --> 04:12.423
Or he thinks
that the women are trash

04:12.424 --> 04:14.091
And he's just placed them
where he thinks they belong.

04:14.092 --> 04:15.492
Well, we can't be sure
of anything yet.

04:15.493 --> 04:17.527
Franklin is an isolated
fishing community

04:17.528 --> 04:19.863
That's been hit really hard
by the current economy.

04:19.863 --> 04:23.033
Add to that a series of unsolved
murders and everyone's on edge.

04:23.034 --> 04:24.635
The local sheriff's
out of his depth.

04:24.636 --> 04:26.270
And Alaska hasn't handled
a serial investigation

04:26.271 --> 04:27.738
Since Robert Hansen
in the eighties.

04:27.739 --> 04:29.840
We'll fly out tonight.
Everybody can sleep on the plane.

04:29.841 --> 04:31.008
Garcia, I need you with us.

04:31.009 --> 04:32.076
Sir?

04:32.077 --> 04:33.244
I've tasked a satellite uplink

04:33.245 --> 04:34.745
And it's your job
to keep us connected.

04:34.746 --> 04:36.047
Yes, sir.

04:36.048 --> 04:37.548
This town's already
on the brink,

04:37.549 --> 04:39.216
And if this pattern continues,
we've only got another day

04:39.217 --> 04:41.318
Until the next murder.
Let's finish this fast.

05:23.328 --> 05:33.531
<font color="#EC14BD">Sync by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#EC14BD">www.addic7ed.com</font>

05:34.077 --> 05:36.378
"nature
in her most dazzling aspects

05:36.379 --> 05:37.612
"or stupendous parts,

05:37.613 --> 05:39.380
"is but the background
and theater

05:39.381 --> 05:40.249
Of the tragedy of man."

05:40.250 --> 05:41.984
John Morley.

05:41.985 --> 05:44.086
This guy's all over the map.

05:44.087 --> 05:45.721
Crosses sex and race boundaries.

05:45.722 --> 05:47.723
He changed his kill method.

05:47.724 --> 05:49.558
It says to me he's disorganized.

05:49.559 --> 05:52.061
Yet there weren't prints
at any of the crime scenes,

05:52.062 --> 05:53.963
And he isolated his victims.

05:53.964 --> 05:55.465
Wearing gloves and making sure

05:55.466 --> 05:56.933
There aren't any witnesses--
that's a no-brainer.

05:56.934 --> 05:58.969
But what concerns me is
the evolution of the kills.

05:58.970 --> 06:00.304
Evolution?

06:00.305 --> 06:02.573
Well, he started
with easy prey.

06:02.574 --> 06:04.442
Jon Baker was
in his mid sixties.

06:04.443 --> 06:06.245
It's relatively low-risk
for a first-timer.

06:06.246 --> 06:08.214
Dedaimia Swanson
was in her early fifties.

06:08.215 --> 06:09.815
She wouldn't be that
difficult to overpower.

06:09.816 --> 06:11.350
But he didn't have to overpower
either one of them.

06:11.351 --> 06:12.585
Both victims were shot.

06:12.586 --> 06:13.986
Which is my point exactly.

06:13.987 --> 06:16.456
He killed them both
from a safe distance.

06:16.457 --> 06:18.658
But Brenda bright was
younger, more athletic.

06:18.659 --> 06:21.027
She would have been able to
put up much more of a fight,

06:21.028 --> 06:22.262
So why not shoot her, too?

06:22.263 --> 06:23.830
That supports
the disorganized theory.

06:23.831 --> 06:26.767
Maybe he didn't get what he wanted
from his first two victims.

06:26.768 --> 06:28.202
Brenda bright
was an attractive woman.

06:28.203 --> 06:31.037
He used an arrow, but he
didn't shoot her with it.

06:31.038 --> 06:32.239
He stabbed her.

06:32.240 --> 06:34.574
I think we all know
what that means.

06:34.575 --> 06:36.576
When we land in Anchorage,

06:36.577 --> 06:38.011
There'll be a float plane
to take us to Franklin.

06:38.012 --> 06:40.046
When we get there, Morgan and
Prentiss work the crime scene.

06:40.047 --> 06:42.316
We need to know exactly how
he ambushed his victims.

06:42.317 --> 06:44.618
Reid and Rossi, the bodies.
Find out what you can there.

06:44.619 --> 06:47.288
JJ and I will work victimology.
And, Garcia, town records.

06:47.289 --> 06:48.456
Find us something we can use.

06:48.457 --> 06:49.857
Of course, sir. I should
let everybody know

06:49.858 --> 06:52.226
That reception in the area
is unreliable at best.

06:52.227 --> 06:54.896
I'm giving everybody satellite
phones for communication,

06:54.897 --> 06:57.031
And I've already preprogrammed
all your digits into speed dial.

06:57.032 --> 06:58.833
Guess who's lucky number 7.

07:29.898 --> 07:32.300
Welcome to Franklin.
I'm deputy flack.

07:32.301 --> 07:33.969
Are these the docks that
Brenda bright was working

07:33.970 --> 07:35.237
The night she was killed?
Yes.

07:35.238 --> 07:37.640
All right,
we'll get started here.

07:45.850 --> 07:46.850
Agent Hotchner?

07:46.851 --> 07:47.851
Yes, sir.

07:47.852 --> 07:48.852
Sheriff Rhodes.

07:48.853 --> 07:49.920
Very nice to meet you.

07:49.921 --> 07:51.255
Good to meet you, sir, ma'am.
Hi.

07:51.256 --> 07:53.123
So I cannot tell you
how grateful I am

07:53.124 --> 07:54.625
That you all could come.

07:54.626 --> 07:56.726
The people here are really
starting to act up.

07:56.727 --> 07:58.862
I'm afraid our little town's
a bit of a powder keg.

07:58.863 --> 08:00.330
Where would you like us
to set up, sir?

08:00.331 --> 08:01.664
You see, there's not
much room at the station

08:01.665 --> 08:03.566
Because that's also
the post office.

08:03.567 --> 08:05.969
But I have made arrangements
for you to work

08:05.970 --> 08:07.937
Out of Carol's tavern,
which is right over there.

08:07.938 --> 08:09.872
Thank you.

08:09.873 --> 08:13.142
Well, thank you.
Appreciate it.

08:13.143 --> 08:14.577
It's pretty isolated out here.

08:14.578 --> 08:16.045
How do you get basic supplies?

08:16.046 --> 08:18.280
Float planes bring grocery
and hardware deliveries

08:18.281 --> 08:21.650
On a weekly basis, and
fishermen and hunters provide

08:21.651 --> 08:23.284
The town's meat supply.

08:23.285 --> 08:25.986
Hey. I'm Craig Ramey.
You all the FBI?

08:25.987 --> 08:27.688
What gave us away?

08:27.689 --> 08:29.523
You're sure packing an awful lot
of stuff for a fishing trip.

08:29.524 --> 08:30.557
I'm not going fishing.

08:30.558 --> 08:32.092
Getting the hell out of dodge

08:32.092 --> 08:33.626
Before it's me or my wife
put in the ground.

08:33.628 --> 08:35.195
Did you know Brenda well?

08:35.196 --> 08:36.530
Everyone did.

08:36.530 --> 08:37.965
She was sweet.

08:37.966 --> 08:40.801
She's pull a haul just as good
as any guy on these docks.

08:40.802 --> 08:43.304
As soon as I get my house
boarded up, I'm heading out.

08:43.304 --> 08:44.805
Suggest you do the same, Susan.

08:46.942 --> 08:48.743
I can't say that I blame him.

08:48.744 --> 08:50.144
With what's been going on,

08:50.145 --> 08:53.347
I'm surprised more people
aren't trying to leave.

08:53.348 --> 08:55.149
This is Keith graves.

08:55.150 --> 08:57.017
He was with Brenda
the night she died.

08:57.018 --> 08:58.685
Mr. Graves,

08:58.686 --> 09:01.855
Did you notice anything out of the
ordinary the night of the murder?

09:01.856 --> 09:04.357
No. I offered
to wait for her,

09:04.358 --> 09:07.160
But she insisted I head
up to town without her.

09:07.161 --> 09:09.062
What were you two
doing that night?

09:09.063 --> 09:10.196
We finished
for the day. I left.

09:10.197 --> 09:11.631
She stuck around
to clean the fish

09:11.632 --> 09:13.166
That she wanted to take home.

09:13.167 --> 09:14.868
She usually walk home alone?

09:14.869 --> 09:16.870
Yeah. Brenda said
that walking

09:16.871 --> 09:18.338
Was good for the soul.

09:18.339 --> 09:20.541
How far is it into town?

09:20.542 --> 09:22.075
About a half a mile.

09:22.076 --> 09:24.678
The unsub could have
waited for her anywhere.

09:24.679 --> 09:27.548
Appreciate your time.

09:29.184 --> 09:30.885
Sheriff asked me to keep
everyone on ice

09:30.886 --> 09:32.253
Till you got here.

09:32.254 --> 09:34.555
Still, I can't believe
someone from Franklin

09:34.556 --> 09:35.923
Would be capable of this.

09:35.924 --> 09:37.925
What convinced you
she was stabbed with the arrow

09:37.926 --> 09:39.060
Instead of shot?

09:39.061 --> 09:40.395
Upward angle
at the point of entry.

09:40.396 --> 09:43.097
He would have had to been
shooting from beneath her.

09:43.098 --> 09:45.199
There wasn't much left.

09:45.200 --> 09:46.701
Forest got to him first.

09:46.702 --> 09:49.170
I found urine on the remains.

09:49.171 --> 09:50.137
Urine?

09:50.138 --> 09:51.772
I thought it was
from the animals

09:51.773 --> 09:54.508
Who scavenged his body, but I got
the lab results back this morning.

09:54.509 --> 09:55.943
The urine was human.

09:55.944 --> 09:56.944
Is he marking his victims?

09:56.945 --> 09:58.846
Only found it on Jon.

09:58.847 --> 10:00.247
Both the women were clean.

10:00.248 --> 10:01.481
Jon was shot 3 times.

10:01.482 --> 10:03.850
The unsub grazed him twice
and then hit him in the head.

10:03.851 --> 10:05.818
Dedaimia Swanson
was only shot once.

10:05.819 --> 10:08.721
The first kill shows
hesitation, uncertainty.

10:08.722 --> 10:11.324
He wasn't confident
taking the terminal shot.

10:11.325 --> 10:13.025
It was either accidental
or spur of the moment,

10:13.026 --> 10:15.127
But the second kill,
he only needed one shot.

10:15.128 --> 10:16.762
He's progressing quickly.

10:16.763 --> 10:18.330
Were you close
with the victims?

10:18.331 --> 10:21.000
An occupational hazard when
you're the only doctor in town.

10:21.001 --> 10:23.935
I delivered Brenda.
Never thought I'd outlive her.

10:23.936 --> 10:25.904
Look at the cuts on her torso.

10:25.905 --> 10:27.839
They're shallow
and non-penetrating.

10:27.840 --> 10:29.441
Not necessary for the murder.

10:29.442 --> 10:31.307
You know what? These
were made postmortem.

10:31.308 --> 10:32.608
He's playing with the bodies,

10:32.609 --> 10:35.010
Experimenting
with his methodology.

10:35.011 --> 10:36.745
Someone incapable of remorse.

10:36.746 --> 10:38.280
We're dealing
with a psychopath.

10:38.281 --> 10:40.582
Have you determined whether
or not she was raped?

10:40.583 --> 10:43.485
I didn't even think to look.

10:51.761 --> 10:54.329
Your report says
the assault occurred here.

10:54.330 --> 10:55.798
That's right. There was
a trail of blood

10:55.799 --> 10:57.800
Coming from that direction.

10:57.801 --> 10:59.769
I don't see any blood.

10:59.770 --> 11:01.037
We covered it up.

11:01.038 --> 11:02.072
You contaminated the scene?

11:02.073 --> 11:03.139
We had to.

11:03.140 --> 11:04.608
We've got a rabid bear
in the woods.

11:04.609 --> 11:05.909
It's been ripping
smaller game to shreds.

11:05.910 --> 11:07.444
A creature like that
smells blood,

11:07.445 --> 11:08.812
He'll come into town,
no hesitation.

11:08.813 --> 11:11.748
Ok, you said the other two victims
were found similar to this?

11:11.749 --> 11:14.618
Jon was found
on the edge of the woods.

11:14.619 --> 11:17.420
Dedaimia was up by crest falls.

11:17.421 --> 11:18.688
It's a popular hiking route.

11:18.689 --> 11:20.289
Who would know their routines?

11:20.290 --> 11:22.358
Everyone.

11:24.327 --> 11:26.695
Cup of coffee, Jace?

11:31.635 --> 11:32.968
Whoa.

11:32.969 --> 11:34.770
What are you doing?

11:34.771 --> 11:38.040
Trying to make this place
a little less analog.

11:38.041 --> 11:41.310
Sorry. I forget my hacker
jokes aren't funny.

11:41.311 --> 11:43.079
My name is Penelope.

11:43.080 --> 11:45.214
I'm the one who doesn't
carry a weapon,

11:45.215 --> 11:46.816
Aside from my biting wit.

11:46.817 --> 11:49.385
And my job includes combining
my kick-ass systems

11:49.386 --> 11:52.355
With your sheriff's
department database

11:52.356 --> 11:54.590
To get the skinny
on your neighbors and you.

11:54.591 --> 11:57.293
Or you could just ask us
what you want to know.

11:57.294 --> 11:59.929
I mean, isn't it better
to just talk to us directly

11:59.930 --> 12:02.564
Than look up our dirt secretly?

12:02.565 --> 12:04.700
No. Because
in my experience,

12:04.701 --> 12:08.103
The information superhighway
never lies and people do.

12:08.104 --> 12:09.805
Your name would be?

12:09.806 --> 12:13.343
Josh. My mom Carol,
she owns the place.

12:13.344 --> 12:15.745
It goes like this.

12:15.746 --> 12:17.047
Here we are.

12:17.048 --> 12:19.183
Joshua Beardsley, age 23,

12:19.184 --> 12:21.118
Born right here
in Franklin, AK.

12:21.119 --> 12:23.421
Moved to Anchorage for
middle and High School.

12:23.422 --> 12:25.423
Majored in hotel
management at Seattle u.

12:25.424 --> 12:27.959
And you moved back home
a few weeks ago.

12:27.960 --> 12:29.761
Perfect timing, huh?

12:29.762 --> 12:31.363
I come home,
people start dying.

12:31.364 --> 12:33.932
Hmm. That's when I check
your criminal record.

12:33.933 --> 12:36.468
And you, my friend,
are clean as a whistle.

12:36.469 --> 12:38.036
What does that even mean?

12:38.037 --> 12:39.238
No idea.

12:39.239 --> 12:41.808
No dirt, anyway,
so, I guess I'm safe, then?

12:41.809 --> 12:44.044
For now.

12:44.045 --> 12:45.979
Those two got into it
last night.

12:45.980 --> 12:48.949
Bob here, he's our newest
resident, so, uh,

12:48.950 --> 12:51.251
Tom figures, well, this is the guy
who's doing all the killings.

12:51.252 --> 12:55.089
He decides to smash him over the
head with a bottle of booze.

12:55.090 --> 12:56.991
Look, I don't know what to do.

12:56.992 --> 12:58.693
Have you thought about having
a kind of town hall meeting

12:58.694 --> 13:00.662
Where you get everybody together and
talk about the facts of the case?

13:00.663 --> 13:02.464
The town's too spread out.

13:02.465 --> 13:05.034
I mean, everybody's doing what
they can just to get by, you know?

13:05.035 --> 13:07.603
Sheriff, I know people move to these
remote locations to be left alone,

13:07.604 --> 13:10.272
But what happened last night
is gonna keep happening,

13:10.273 --> 13:13.041
And people are going to start taking
matters into their own hands.

13:13.042 --> 13:15.243
Well, I can keep order
in my own town,

13:15.244 --> 13:17.278
But people around here, I mean,

13:17.279 --> 13:18.746
This is Alaska, man.

13:18.747 --> 13:20.781
They do what they want.

13:25.986 --> 13:28.488
He's already experimenting
with his victims.

13:28.489 --> 13:31.291
He violated Brenda bright
with an arrow.

13:31.292 --> 13:33.594
And he's inciting panic.
People who have lived here most of their lives

13:33.595 --> 13:34.695
Are packing up to leave.

13:34.696 --> 13:36.731
Can you blame them?
We have a psychopath

13:36.732 --> 13:38.900
Whose hunting ground is
a town of 1,400 people.

13:38.901 --> 13:42.138
Most of them grew up learning to
kill animals and start fires.

13:42.139 --> 13:44.473
It sounds like
your basic survival skills.

13:44.474 --> 13:46.409
No. They're
hunting skills.

13:46.410 --> 13:48.645
Think about it.
The marksmanship,

13:48.646 --> 13:50.814
The urine--
it makes sense.

13:50.815 --> 13:52.081
The urine makes sense?

13:52.082 --> 13:53.449
It's a hunter's trick.

13:53.450 --> 13:55.852
You urinate downwind
to keep the animals away.

13:55.853 --> 13:58.021
He tried to preserve
Jon Baker's body

13:58.022 --> 13:59.423
So it would be
discovered intact.

13:59.424 --> 14:02.126
All right, so we've got a
psychopath with hunting skills

14:02.127 --> 14:04.495
Who knows the routines
of everyone in town.

14:04.496 --> 14:07.231
How are we supposed to
keep everyone safe?

14:07.232 --> 14:09.600
Sheriff, I suggest
you institute a curfew

14:09.601 --> 14:11.169
Until we have the unsub
in custody.

14:11.170 --> 14:12.203
Nobody out after dark.

14:12.204 --> 14:13.371
I'll have one of my deputies

14:13.372 --> 14:14.572
Patrolling around the clock.

14:14.573 --> 14:16.474
Garcia, how's it coming
with town records?

14:16.475 --> 14:18.443
I've run everyone who's
been printed through CODIS.

14:18.444 --> 14:21.045
Nothing's come up so far.
I'm gonna pull an all-nighter,

14:21.046 --> 14:22.513
Finish going through
the town records.

14:22.514 --> 14:24.115
Should have background checks
by sunrise.

14:24.116 --> 14:26.384
Good. The rest of us
should get some sleep,

14:26.385 --> 14:27.552
Start fresh in the morning.

14:27.553 --> 14:29.822
I've got 4 of the upstairs
rooms available.

14:29.823 --> 14:31.425
Uh, 4?

14:31.426 --> 14:32.793
Come on,
that's the best we can do.

14:32.794 --> 14:35.796
Your team is double
the size of my department.

14:35.797 --> 14:37.030
I'll see you in the morning.

14:37.031 --> 14:38.065
Good night.

14:38.066 --> 14:39.099
It looks like we'll
have to double up.

14:39.100 --> 14:40.534
I'm not sleeping with Reid.

14:42.670 --> 14:44.437
Dibs.

14:45.606 --> 14:48.407
What do you mean, you're
sharing a room with Morgan?

14:48.408 --> 14:50.109
Oh, you're jealous.

14:50.110 --> 14:52.111
Jealous? Why?

14:52.112 --> 14:55.548
Because you're
bedding down with a...

14:55.549 --> 14:57.984
Muscle-bound,
modern-day 007?

14:57.985 --> 15:00.186
Mm, he's more like
Jason Bourne.

15:00.187 --> 15:02.422
Oh, what's there
to be jealous about?

15:02.423 --> 15:04.258
He took the floor.

15:04.259 --> 15:06.060
Ok. Just...
Just make sure

15:06.061 --> 15:07.862
He keeps his weapon
holstered, OK?

15:09.597 --> 15:12.799
Why are you up right now,
anyway? It's so late.

15:12.800 --> 15:15.535
Actually, it's early.
I just got to Quantico.

15:15.536 --> 15:17.904
Ohh. Damn time zones.

15:17.905 --> 15:19.806
hello?

15:19.807 --> 15:21.074
Hello?

15:21.909 --> 15:24.311
Hello.

15:25.780 --> 15:27.580
Ohh...Frak.

15:48.570 --> 15:52.340
Oh, come on, baby.

15:52.341 --> 15:54.141
Come on, come on, come on.

15:57.280 --> 15:59.882
Nice one, Garcie.

15:59.883 --> 16:02.451
Oh!

16:46.195 --> 16:49.464
Ohh...Oh...

16:49.465 --> 16:50.799
Look at me.

16:50.800 --> 16:52.868
Hey.
You're gonna be OK.

16:52.869 --> 16:54.103
My name's Penelope.

16:54.104 --> 16:55.204
You're gonna be OK.
You're gonna be OK.

16:55.205 --> 16:56.372
Just keep looking at me.

17:00.744 --> 17:02.211
Help!

17:02.212 --> 17:03.746
Help!

17:03.747 --> 17:05.248
Please!

17:05.249 --> 17:08.585
Somebody come help here!

17:08.586 --> 17:10.685
Someone is hurt!

17:10.686 --> 17:12.255
Please!

17:13.896 --> 17:16.363
His name's Craig Ramey.
Fisherman.

17:16.364 --> 17:17.865
Morgan and I
met him this morning.

17:17.866 --> 17:19.333
He was packing up to leave.

17:19.334 --> 17:20.634
He's accelerating his schedule.

17:20.635 --> 17:22.203
We should have had another day.
Why change that?

17:22.204 --> 17:24.438
Ramey was pretty vocal about
wanting to get out of town.

17:24.439 --> 17:26.507
If the unsub knew that,
he could have struck early

17:26.508 --> 17:28.008
To prevent his target
from getting away.

17:28.009 --> 17:29.609
There has to be more
to it than that.

17:29.610 --> 17:32.579
He brought the body to the
tavern we're staying at.

17:32.580 --> 17:34.081
He's telling us that
he's not afraid of us.

17:34.082 --> 17:35.482
He's gaining confidence.

17:35.483 --> 17:36.816
He switched to a hunting knife.

17:36.817 --> 17:39.485
Looks like a jagged edge.

17:39.486 --> 17:41.921
There's more physical damage,
too, like he was cut open.

17:41.922 --> 17:43.723
I won't know until
Dr. Johnson does an autopsy,

17:43.724 --> 17:46.325
But I'd be willing to bet he took
a piece of the victim with him.

17:46.326 --> 17:47.593
What kind of piece?

17:47.594 --> 17:49.362
It's hard to say,
but judging from the location,

17:49.363 --> 17:51.831
I would guess liver or spleen.

17:57.871 --> 17:59.638
He was alive.

18:00.874 --> 18:03.275
What?

18:03.276 --> 18:05.010
He was still alive.

18:05.011 --> 18:07.480
Baby, there's nothing else
you could have done.

18:07.481 --> 18:10.015
I felt him leave.

18:10.016 --> 18:12.817
He was there one second,

18:12.818 --> 18:16.221
And then--
just a body.

18:16.222 --> 18:20.058
I'm really sorry that you
had to see all of that.

18:20.059 --> 18:24.329
Derek, I--I didn't see,
I was in it.

18:24.330 --> 18:26.498
I was sort of used to
seeing horrible things

18:26.499 --> 18:28.534
From the safety
of my screens every day,

18:28.535 --> 18:32.005
But this was...
Right there.

18:33.640 --> 18:36.476
Why didn't you go and find someone
before you ran out there?

18:37.712 --> 18:41.881
Because when I got shot,
I remember thinking

18:41.882 --> 18:44.249
The last thing I'm ever
gonna see in this life

18:44.250 --> 18:45.583
Is the man who killed me,

18:45.584 --> 18:47.485
And I couldn't let that
happen to him.

18:47.486 --> 18:49.654
He had to see something
good before he died.

18:49.655 --> 18:52.890
You ran right towards the unsub.
You could have been killed.

18:52.891 --> 18:54.759
I know that.
Don't treat me like I'm the victim.

18:54.760 --> 18:57.194
All right. I'm sorry.

18:58.330 --> 19:00.531
I want to ask you a couple
of questions, all right?

19:00.532 --> 19:02.166
No. I--I told you
everything I saw.

19:02.167 --> 19:03.668
You said the man's face
was mostly in shadow,

19:03.669 --> 19:05.135
But there was also a lot
of blood on it.

19:05.136 --> 19:07.171
You might have seen more
than you actually realize.

19:07.172 --> 19:10.074
No. Cognitive interviews, breaking
someone's death down to a science

19:10.075 --> 19:11.975
And statistic--
that is your world, Derek,

19:11.976 --> 19:14.077
Not mine!
I will help from mine.

19:14.078 --> 19:15.078
Penelope!

19:15.079 --> 19:18.248
Derek, let her go.

19:18.249 --> 19:20.617
Will you look after her,
please?

19:20.618 --> 19:23.152
Yeah, of course.

19:33.396 --> 19:35.630
Was Garcia able to give you
any new information?

19:35.631 --> 19:37.498
She's given all she can.

19:37.499 --> 19:39.267
This guy's taunting us.
He's one step ahead.

19:39.268 --> 19:41.503
I think you're giving him
more credit than he deserves.

19:41.504 --> 19:43.072
It's like Emily said on the
plane, he's all over the place.

19:43.073 --> 19:44.440
The victimology's inconsistent,

19:44.441 --> 19:46.042
The methodology's evolving,

19:46.043 --> 19:47.744
The first kill was sloppy,
hesitant, and unplanned.

19:47.745 --> 19:49.546
It was an accident,

19:49.547 --> 19:52.382
But it triggered a sexual response.
He got off on it.

19:52.383 --> 19:54.284
And he knew then and there
he had to kill again.

19:54.285 --> 19:55.986
He learned how to get the
job done more efficiently.

19:55.987 --> 19:57.254
Yeah, but why the organs?

19:57.255 --> 19:59.389
Consumption typically
indicates a desire

19:59.390 --> 20:01.191
To keep the victim with them.

20:01.192 --> 20:02.759
He's having trouble letting go.

20:02.760 --> 20:05.595
We're probably looking for someone
with severe abandonment issues.

20:05.596 --> 20:08.096
It'll be light soon.
Let's get everybody together

20:08.097 --> 20:09.898
And go over what we know.

20:11.433 --> 20:13.567
We're looking for
an emotionally immature male,

20:13.568 --> 20:15.169
Probably in his
mid to late twenties,

20:15.170 --> 20:17.070
Who suffered a traumatic loss.

20:17.071 --> 20:19.272
Now, this loss
could be anything.

20:19.273 --> 20:22.376
Death of a parent, separation of a
spouse, a loved one who moved away.

20:22.377 --> 20:24.645
Something that made the unsub
feel abandoned and alone.

20:24.646 --> 20:27.114
He'll have extensive
hunting experience.

20:27.115 --> 20:29.783
The bodies were buried
not because of remorse,

20:29.784 --> 20:32.786
They were buried to protect them
from wild animals.

20:32.787 --> 20:34.955
His familiarity with
the victims' routines

20:34.956 --> 20:38.191
Suggests the unsub has lived
here for most of his life.

20:38.192 --> 20:39.359
He also has extensive knowledge

20:39.360 --> 20:40.960
Of the landscape
and surroundings.

20:40.961 --> 20:42.929
So we should split up
and cover the town.

20:42.930 --> 20:46.165
Focus on younger residents with a
history of petty crimes and assaults.

20:46.166 --> 20:47.900
You should look in their trash,

20:47.901 --> 20:49.968
Fireplaces, even in laundry.

20:49.969 --> 20:52.738
Look for signs of bloody clothes
or even cuts and bruises.

20:52.739 --> 20:54.406
One of the victims may have
gotten in a good blow or two

20:54.407 --> 20:55.807
Before they died.

20:55.808 --> 20:57.876
Bring in anyone who seems
to have something to hide.

20:57.877 --> 20:59.444
The unsub has already
broken patterns,

20:59.445 --> 21:01.480
So he could strike again
at any time.

21:01.481 --> 21:03.081
Sheriff, you and I need
to look at the school,

21:03.082 --> 21:05.284
Talk to the teacher, see if she
remembers any students exhibiting

21:05.285 --> 21:07.519
Early signs of homicidal
tendencies.

21:07.520 --> 21:09.154
Let's move.

21:09.155 --> 21:12.258
Dedaimia was only one month
away from retirement.

21:12.259 --> 21:13.960
I can't believe she's gone.

21:13.961 --> 21:15.895
We're very sorry for your loss.

21:15.896 --> 21:17.897
I need to ask about
your former students.

21:17.898 --> 21:19.999
Do you remember any of
them enjoying hunting

21:20.000 --> 21:22.568
Too much, so much
that it worried you?

21:22.569 --> 21:25.404
All the boys around here
like it too much.

21:25.405 --> 21:27.706
They have competitions to
see who's the better shot.

21:27.707 --> 21:29.141
This would have been extreme.

21:29.142 --> 21:32.110
Do you remember anyone
who might have tortured animals

21:32.111 --> 21:34.779
Or played with them
before he killed them?

21:36.582 --> 21:38.416
Does that sound like
someone you know?

21:38.417 --> 21:43.021
I've never seen anyone enjoy hunting
as much as Joshua Beardsley.

21:43.022 --> 21:44.389
He's the tavern owner's son?

21:44.390 --> 21:45.356
Yeah.

21:45.357 --> 21:46.791
The youngest boy in town
to bag a deer.

21:46.792 --> 21:48.292
That's all he ever
talked about.

21:48.293 --> 21:50.394
He hunted something
nearly every day.

21:50.395 --> 21:52.363
He was born and raised here.

21:52.364 --> 21:54.632
He returned a couple of weeks
ago after his dad died.

21:54.633 --> 21:55.933
How old is he?

21:55.934 --> 21:57.168
23?
Sure.

21:57.169 --> 21:58.669
We need to talk to him.

21:58.670 --> 21:59.670
All right.

21:59.671 --> 22:01.005
Thank you.

22:01.006 --> 22:02.606
What's this about?

22:04.909 --> 22:08.946
The strike was above the gut.

22:08.947 --> 22:12.583
It keeps the meat from spoiling.
Isn't that right?

22:12.584 --> 22:15.186
On a deer, maybe.

22:15.187 --> 22:17.188
Doubt it'd be the same
for a human.

22:17.189 --> 22:20.991
But then he did something
interesting.

22:20.992 --> 22:22.960
He took the victim's spleen.

22:22.961 --> 22:24.228
Now, tell me,

22:24.229 --> 22:26.898
Why would he do that?

22:26.899 --> 22:28.966
No idea.

22:30.802 --> 22:33.604
Let's stop playing games,
Joshua.

22:33.605 --> 22:36.273
Answer my questions
and maybe I'll believe you.

22:39.343 --> 22:44.014
It's a native hunting
tradition, isn't it?

22:44.015 --> 22:46.283
Eat part of the kill.

22:46.284 --> 22:47.951
Gain the life force
of your prey.

22:47.952 --> 22:49.720
Not many people know that.

22:49.721 --> 22:51.356
I'm not many people.

22:52.391 --> 22:53.825
Where did you learn to hunt?

22:53.826 --> 22:55.694
Bagged my first deer
when I was 7.

22:55.695 --> 22:57.195
That's pretty young.

22:57.196 --> 22:59.397
My dad taught me
how to live off the land.

22:59.398 --> 23:01.365
I ate the heart
of my first kill.

23:01.366 --> 23:03.034
That proves
you're a true hunter.

23:04.703 --> 23:07.838
So, you, um, enjoy hunting?

23:07.839 --> 23:09.273
It's my favorite thing to do.

23:09.274 --> 23:13.976
Then would you say
you take pleasure in the kill?

23:13.977 --> 23:15.310
Doesn't everyone?

23:16.412 --> 23:18.780
Actually, no...

23:18.781 --> 23:20.415
They don't.

23:26.588 --> 23:28.790
What do you think?

23:28.791 --> 23:30.525
I'm not sure.

23:30.526 --> 23:34.328
He fits the profile, but he's acting
like a man with nothing to hide.

23:34.329 --> 23:36.730
The attack cycle's accelerating.
He should strike tonight.

23:36.731 --> 23:39.498
And if he doesn't, we know
we've got our guy in custody.

23:39.499 --> 23:40.632
And what if he does?

23:40.633 --> 23:42.100
Look, I hate to say it,

23:42.101 --> 23:44.869
But half this town matches
most of your profile.

23:46.204 --> 23:48.805
Hey. What are you guys
working on?

23:48.806 --> 23:51.173
Hotch asked if we'd go through
Garcia's background profiles,

23:51.174 --> 23:53.508
Try to find a link between
Joshua and the 4 victims.

23:53.509 --> 23:54.576
You find anything?

23:54.577 --> 23:56.177
They all had hunting licenses.

23:56.178 --> 23:58.579
needle, meet haystack.

23:58.580 --> 24:00.047
Yeah, we need the big guns.

24:00.048 --> 24:02.682
Ripped and ready to rumble.

24:02.683 --> 24:04.785
Uh, maybe you should
sit this one out.

24:04.786 --> 24:07.154
No, Jaje, I'm OK.

24:07.155 --> 24:10.223
Put this bastard
where he belongs.

24:10.224 --> 24:11.992
Joshua Beardsley?

24:11.993 --> 24:14.594
Yeah. We think
he's our unsub.

24:14.595 --> 24:16.696
No, he's not.
He fits the profile.

24:16.697 --> 24:18.498
Abandonment issue triggered
by his father's recent death.

24:18.499 --> 24:19.898
Hunting experience,
Reid--

24:19.899 --> 24:21.199
Experimentation with animals.

24:21.200 --> 24:22.833
Reid.

24:22.834 --> 24:24.301
You arrested my son?

24:24.302 --> 24:27.203
We brought him in
as a precaution.

24:31.207 --> 24:33.274
I'm telling you, it's not him.

24:33.275 --> 24:34.542
What makes you so sure?

24:34.543 --> 24:35.843
Because the unsub
ran away from me.

24:35.844 --> 24:37.377
Of course he ran.
He knew you were FBI.

24:37.378 --> 24:38.611
But Joshua knows I'm a techie.

24:38.612 --> 24:39.813
He knows I don't
carry a weapon.

24:39.814 --> 24:42.014
If he was the unsub,
I'd be dead right now.

24:43.250 --> 24:45.384
How can you be listening
to any of this, Steve?

24:45.385 --> 24:47.653
You know Joshua
would never do this.

24:47.654 --> 24:50.523
Look, I never thought any of
us were capable of doing this.

24:50.524 --> 24:52.958
But 4 people are dead, Carol.

24:55.962 --> 24:58.497
You don't know him.
He's a good boy.

24:58.498 --> 25:00.098
He's a good boy
who recently lost his father

25:00.099 --> 25:01.466
And it's a lot
of emotional stress.

25:01.467 --> 25:03.801
It's been tough,
but we're coping.

25:03.802 --> 25:04.835
He's doing fine.

25:04.836 --> 25:06.770
Why did he move back to town?

25:06.771 --> 25:08.404
I needed him here
to help with the inn.

25:08.405 --> 25:11.006
I can't handle it on my own.

25:11.007 --> 25:13.174
And how did that make him feel,

25:13.175 --> 25:15.510
Having to drop everything
and move back home?

25:17.946 --> 25:20.047
He didn't do this.

25:20.048 --> 25:21.581
We need to be sure.

25:21.582 --> 25:22.916
I'm sure.

25:22.917 --> 25:24.450
I'm his mother.

25:24.451 --> 25:25.985
Carol, it's one night.

25:25.986 --> 25:28.587
If nothing happens, you
pick him up in the morning.

25:31.690 --> 25:34.491
Wait a minute. You said the
unsub has abandonment issues.

25:34.492 --> 25:37.060
And Craig Ramey was
leaving town, right?

25:37.061 --> 25:39.062
Yeah, he couldn't wait
to get out of town.

25:39.063 --> 25:40.430
Ok.

25:40.431 --> 25:42.598
Uh...Let's see.

25:42.599 --> 25:45.635
Dedaimia Swanson
was retiring in a month.

25:45.636 --> 25:47.203
She was moving to Florida.

25:47.204 --> 25:48.671
What about the other two?

25:48.672 --> 25:51.641
UN, Jon Baker just bought
property in Fairbanks,

25:51.642 --> 25:53.643
And he and his wife
just separated.

25:53.644 --> 25:55.611
She just filed
the divorce papers.

25:55.612 --> 25:58.380
Well, welcome back,
red delicious.

25:58.381 --> 26:00.916
Take a bite out of this.
So far, 3 of our victims

26:00.917 --> 26:03.618
Were on the fast track to getting out of town.
And let's see...

26:03.619 --> 26:06.453
Connect 4. Brenda just
accepted a job in Seattle.

26:06.454 --> 26:08.455
Anyone else look like
they might be leaving town?

26:08.456 --> 26:09.455
Um...I got one.

26:09.456 --> 26:10.923
Kat Allen.

26:10.924 --> 26:13.325
She was accepted
to the summer honors program

26:13.326 --> 26:14.826
At the university
of Bloomington.

26:14.827 --> 26:16.961
She currently works as a waitress
at big John's coffeehouse.

26:16.962 --> 26:18.329
Penelope, you are--

26:18.330 --> 26:19.430
So ready to go home.

26:19.431 --> 26:20.865
Prentiss.

26:36.846 --> 26:39.748
Hi. We're looking
for Kat Allen.

26:39.749 --> 26:42.418
I'm Kat.

26:44.421 --> 26:46.122
Can we talk?

26:46.123 --> 26:48.491
It was completely unexpected.

26:48.492 --> 26:49.825
Never been married.

26:49.826 --> 26:53.161
I'd given up
on ever having kids.

26:53.162 --> 26:56.297
Do you mind my asking
who the father is?

26:56.298 --> 26:58.233
A guy I met on a cruise.

26:58.234 --> 27:00.668
He doesn't want anything
to do with her.

27:00.669 --> 27:03.405
But I do. I want to be able
to give her a good life,

27:03.406 --> 27:05.273
So I'm going back to school.

27:05.274 --> 27:08.476
Did you tell anyone
that you were leaving?

27:08.477 --> 27:11.212
Yeah. A couple
of people.

27:11.213 --> 27:13.014
Uh, I don't know...

27:13.015 --> 27:15.249
My mom. My boss.

27:15.250 --> 27:16.884
We're going to need you
to come with us.

27:16.885 --> 27:18.319
Why? What's this about?

27:18.320 --> 27:21.155
It's just for tonight.
It's for your protection.

27:34.067 --> 27:36.034
Damn it.

28:08.635 --> 28:11.269
Aah!

28:11.270 --> 28:13.771
Aah! Uhh! Uhh!

28:22.538 --> 28:25.473
The neighbors saw
the door open, called it in.

28:26.924 --> 28:30.327
He went from ambushing people
in public to home invasion.

28:30.328 --> 28:32.428
That's a pretty big change
in m.O.

28:32.429 --> 28:34.497
This one's personal.
It's angry.

28:34.498 --> 28:36.431
Her intestines are
splayed out everywhere.

28:36.432 --> 28:39.167
Yeah. And the blood on her face
is smeared, not splattered.

28:39.168 --> 28:42.837
He played with the body.
He mutilated her.

28:42.838 --> 28:44.839
If this guy's killing
people leaving town,

28:44.840 --> 28:46.773
Why didn't he attack Kat Allen?

28:46.774 --> 28:48.275
Because we had her
in protective custody.

28:48.276 --> 28:50.978
He couldn't get to her, so he
moved on to another target.

28:50.979 --> 28:52.780
A target who broke her routine.

28:52.781 --> 28:54.282
Carol was scheduled
to be at the tavern tonight.

28:54.283 --> 28:55.650
How did the unsub
know she was here?

28:55.651 --> 28:57.619
He was stalking her.

28:57.620 --> 28:59.454
He chose Carol
for a different reason.

28:59.455 --> 29:01.289
Why? What's changed?

29:06.529 --> 29:09.498
You guys finally realize
I'm innocent?

29:09.499 --> 29:11.499
Joshua, please have a seat.

29:11.500 --> 29:12.967
More questions?

29:12.968 --> 29:14.802
You serious?

29:14.803 --> 29:16.703
I'm telling you,
I didn't do this.

29:16.704 --> 29:18.104
We know that, son.

29:18.105 --> 29:19.272
Please, sit down.

29:19.273 --> 29:21.341
What's going on?

29:22.276 --> 29:26.512
Josh, the--the killer
struck again last night.

29:26.513 --> 29:28.514
Ohh, God.

29:28.515 --> 29:30.149
Who did he get?

29:33.019 --> 29:35.654
Why are you guys
only telling me this?

29:38.325 --> 29:40.726
Where's my mom?

29:42.562 --> 29:44.530
No.

29:44.531 --> 29:45.898
No.

29:45.899 --> 29:47.065
No. No, no, no, no.

29:47.066 --> 29:49.100
No, no, no, that's impossible.

29:49.101 --> 29:51.035
She--she was just here.

29:51.036 --> 29:53.203
I--I just talked to her!

29:53.204 --> 29:54.371
I'm sorry, Joshua.

29:54.372 --> 29:55.372
She's gone.

29:55.373 --> 29:57.941
Oh, no. No, no,
no, no. No, no. You--

29:57.942 --> 30:00.443
You're lying.

30:00.444 --> 30:02.511
I wish we were.

30:02.512 --> 30:03.879
I need to see her.

30:03.880 --> 30:05.214
Not right now.

30:05.215 --> 30:06.849
You don't want to think
of her that way.

30:06.850 --> 30:09.751
Joshua, we know
you need time to mourn,

30:09.752 --> 30:12.320
But the fact of the matter
is, the man who did this

30:12.321 --> 30:15.691
Is still out there, and we think
that you can help us find him.

30:15.692 --> 30:18.927
You had me locked up

30:18.928 --> 30:21.231
While she was--

30:23.567 --> 30:24.934
I could have helped her.

30:24.935 --> 30:26.736
If you had gone to her,

30:26.737 --> 30:28.571
There's a good chance
you'd both be dead.

30:28.572 --> 30:30.840
Now we need your help.

30:30.841 --> 30:32.075
Why me?

30:32.076 --> 30:34.544
The murders began
when you returned to town.

30:34.545 --> 30:36.445
Now, up until now,
he's only targeted people

30:36.446 --> 30:38.214
Who were trying to leave,
but for some reason,

30:38.215 --> 30:40.282
With your mother,
it was personal.

30:40.283 --> 30:41.717
The pressure's on.
The FBI is here.

30:41.718 --> 30:44.086
In that situation, a serial killer
wants to finish what he started,

30:44.087 --> 30:46.554
He goes after the true
target of his cause.

30:46.555 --> 30:47.822
Personal?

30:47.823 --> 30:49.224
Can you think of anyone who
had a grudge against her?

30:49.225 --> 30:50.759
Anyone at all?

30:50.760 --> 30:52.528
How about anyone
with a grudge against you?

30:52.529 --> 30:55.364
No. No. Everybody loved her.

30:57.234 --> 31:00.235
The man that we're looking for
has severe abandonment issues.

31:00.236 --> 31:01.737
Now, can you think of a time

31:01.738 --> 31:03.872
When you or your mother
left somebody,

31:03.873 --> 31:06.875
Maybe like a bad break-up or a
fight that ended a friendship?

31:06.876 --> 31:08.710
Did your mother ever take
anyone in at the inn

31:08.711 --> 31:10.479
Who had family problems,

31:10.480 --> 31:12.514
Maybe someone who had
been kicked out

31:12.515 --> 31:15.849
Or lost someone unexpectedly?

31:15.850 --> 31:19.854
No. No, no, no, no,
there was nothing like that.

31:19.855 --> 31:22.890
Uh, listen, can I
go see my mom now?

31:22.891 --> 31:25.326
Josh. Josh, you need to
let these people help.

31:25.327 --> 31:27.128
No, I need--
I need to see my mom.

31:27.129 --> 31:28.596
Well, let's have
someone take you.

31:28.597 --> 31:30.765
It's OK. I know the way.

31:35.537 --> 31:37.605
Did you see his behavior shift

31:37.606 --> 31:40.441
From wanting to help us
to wanting to leave? He's lying.

31:40.442 --> 31:43.211
Because he knows
who the unsub is.

31:44.313 --> 31:46.548
I got one of my deputies
tailing Joshua.

31:46.549 --> 31:49.451
If he does something stupid,
we're gonna know.

31:49.452 --> 31:51.419
There's got to be
a connection we're missing.

31:51.420 --> 31:52.554
Garcia, anything?

31:52.555 --> 31:53.922
Their lives have been
torn apart,

31:53.923 --> 31:56.057
Figuratively and literally,
and I can't find anything.

31:56.058 --> 31:57.658
Try again.

31:57.659 --> 31:59.493
I'm hacking into his college
database as we speak.

31:59.494 --> 32:02.196
Maybe there's something about his
life in Seattle I may have missed.

32:02.197 --> 32:03.464
Good. All right, why Carol?

32:03.465 --> 32:05.432
Why the mutilation?
Why the overkill?

32:05.433 --> 32:06.400
Mutilation?

32:06.401 --> 32:07.867
You said you found the remains

32:07.868 --> 32:11.104
Of mutilated animals in the
woods from a rabid bear?

32:11.105 --> 32:12.038
That's right.

32:12.039 --> 32:13.407
Did you take pictures of them?

32:13.408 --> 32:14.508
Of course we did.

32:14.509 --> 32:16.743
We documented everything
for identification.

32:18.246 --> 32:20.514
We'll need to see those
pictures right away.

32:20.515 --> 32:22.449
Sheriff, we need to
adjust the profile.

32:22.450 --> 32:23.784
What do you mean?

32:23.785 --> 32:26.287
These animals weren't
mutilated by a rabid bear.

32:26.288 --> 32:28.223
Someone did this.

32:29.291 --> 32:31.159
You mean a person.

32:31.160 --> 32:32.761
An animal wouldn't
have left so much.

32:32.762 --> 32:34.329
We should have seen it before.

32:34.330 --> 32:36.098
It's homicidal triad 101.

32:36.099 --> 32:37.533
We said the kills
were all over the map.

32:37.534 --> 32:39.602
The unsub lacks sophistication
and shows immaturity

32:39.603 --> 32:41.270
In his kills because
he is immature.

32:41.271 --> 32:43.907
He started with animals because
that's what he was taught

32:43.908 --> 32:45.042
Ever since he was a child.

32:45.043 --> 32:46.210
And when he got
bored with animals,

32:46.211 --> 32:47.711
He moved on
to more challenging prey.

32:47.712 --> 32:48.845
People.

32:48.846 --> 32:50.313
Your unsub's a teenage boy.

32:54.418 --> 32:56.619
The boy we were
talking about before,

32:56.620 --> 32:58.855
He wouldn't be a former student,
he'd be a current student,

32:58.856 --> 33:00.456
A teenager who loves to hunt.

33:00.457 --> 33:02.425
I only have
two teenagers right now.

33:02.426 --> 33:03.926
Both of them are girls.

33:09.267 --> 33:10.700
Go ahead, Garcia.

33:10.701 --> 33:12.269
I found something uber weird.

33:12.270 --> 33:14.537
In Joshua's college
application essay,

33:14.538 --> 33:17.807
He talks about the impact that being
an older brother had on his life.

33:17.808 --> 33:19.275
I thought he didn't
have any siblings.

33:19.276 --> 33:20.943
He doesn't,
and yet he's talking

33:20.944 --> 33:23.112
About how hard it was
to leave him behind

33:23.113 --> 33:24.447
When he moved to Anchorage,

33:24.448 --> 33:26.215
To leave him unprotected.

33:26.216 --> 33:27.683
Thanks.

33:32.122 --> 33:35.290
Was there a student that Joshua
may have taken under his wing

33:35.291 --> 33:36.625
Before he moved away?

33:36.626 --> 33:39.861
Someone you may have
suspected was being abused?

33:42.831 --> 33:44.732
Oh, my God.

33:44.733 --> 33:45.834
What?

33:45.835 --> 33:47.402
Owen Porter.

33:47.403 --> 33:49.738
He's not a student anymore.
He's home-schooled.

33:49.739 --> 33:52.808
Joshua and he were attached at
the hip when they were younger.

33:52.809 --> 33:55.310
I've been called out to the
Porter house several times.

33:55.311 --> 33:57.279
Domestic disturbance.

33:57.280 --> 34:00.315
Owen and his mom always
covering for the dad.

34:00.316 --> 34:02.184
Let's go.

34:02.185 --> 34:03.986
Thanks.

34:04.821 --> 34:06.589
Talk about abandonment issues.

34:06.590 --> 34:10.725
Owen was left victim to the
abusive hand of his father.

34:10.726 --> 34:13.728
Joshua's return probably derailed
Owen's mental stability.

34:13.730 --> 34:16.665
Add to that the accidental shooting
of Jon Baker and he snapped.

34:16.666 --> 34:18.065
He got off
on that first killing.

34:18.067 --> 34:19.233
He had to do it again.

34:19.234 --> 34:20.900
So he targeted people
trying to leave town.

34:20.902 --> 34:22.870
In his mind, when people
leave, he gets hurt.

34:22.871 --> 34:25.304
And he resented Carol
for taking Joshua away,

34:25.306 --> 34:27.306
So he killed her to make sure
he never left again.

34:27.308 --> 34:28.440
Where would he go now?

34:28.442 --> 34:29.777
We're surrounded by
waterways and mountains.

34:29.777 --> 34:31.045
He could be anywhere.

34:33.014 --> 34:34.781
Mr. Porter,
is your son at home?

34:34.782 --> 34:36.049
What's it to you?

34:36.050 --> 34:37.784
Turn that off.

34:39.722 --> 34:42.290
Did you know?

34:42.291 --> 34:43.458
Don't know what
you're talking about!

34:43.458 --> 34:44.826
Not for sure.

34:44.827 --> 34:46.027
Not until last night.

34:46.029 --> 34:47.829
He came home covered in blood.

34:47.830 --> 34:49.565
He's not here.
But the window's open.

34:49.565 --> 34:51.766
It's not the first time you've washed
blood out of his clothes, is it?

34:51.766 --> 34:53.101
Don't answer them, Martha!

34:53.101 --> 34:54.268
Sit down and shut up.

34:54.270 --> 34:57.271
I promise he will not
lay a hand on you again.

34:59.641 --> 35:01.776
No.

35:01.777 --> 35:04.111
It wasn't the first time.

35:04.112 --> 35:06.280
Mrs. Porter, I understand you're
only trying to protect Owen,

35:06.281 --> 35:07.415
But you can't anymore.

35:07.416 --> 35:09.884
He's always been different.

35:09.885 --> 35:11.786
He's not like us.

35:11.787 --> 35:14.722
When he was a little boy, he
used to go out into the woods

35:14.723 --> 35:16.458
And come home covered in blood.

35:16.459 --> 35:17.992
Why didn't you
tell anyone, Martha?

35:17.993 --> 35:20.795
How could you just sit there and
do nothing while people died?

35:20.796 --> 35:22.897
How did Owen react
when Joshua was sent away?

35:22.898 --> 35:25.799
He wanted to leave, too.

35:25.800 --> 35:27.868
But I couldn't let him.

35:27.869 --> 35:30.237
Mrs. Porter, do you have any
idea what social isolation

35:30.238 --> 35:32.572
Does to a child?

35:32.573 --> 35:34.574
I was afraid
of what he might do

35:34.575 --> 35:36.743
If he ever left here.

35:36.744 --> 35:39.412
We knew.

35:39.413 --> 35:42.348
We knew what he was.

35:42.349 --> 35:43.615
We've got a problem.

35:43.616 --> 35:44.683
What is it?

35:44.684 --> 35:46.585
Joshua managed
to shake deputy stiller.

35:46.586 --> 35:49.455
And someone reported a hunting
party going into the woods.

35:49.456 --> 35:50.623
Oh, God.

35:51.991 --> 35:53.892
They're hunting Owen.

36:28.842 --> 36:31.577
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Shh.

36:32.445 --> 36:33.579
Listen.

36:33.580 --> 36:36.315
That way. Go.

36:46.260 --> 36:47.494
You have him?

36:47.495 --> 36:49.329
No. He's moving
too fast.

36:49.330 --> 36:51.097
Looks like he's circling
back towards town.

36:51.098 --> 36:52.165
Maybe we'll get lucky.

36:54.001 --> 36:55.268
Did they just shoot him?

36:55.269 --> 36:56.836
They would be shooting
if they weren't close.

36:56.837 --> 36:58.171
Let's go.

37:02.376 --> 37:03.543
Do you know where he's headed?

37:03.544 --> 37:04.978
Was there a place
he went to be alone?

37:04.979 --> 37:06.446
A hiding spot when
you were mad at him?

37:06.447 --> 37:08.549
Hiding spot. How the hell
are we supposed to know?

37:08.550 --> 37:10.217
If you know,
you need to tell me.

37:10.218 --> 37:12.819
I'm trying to help him.
There's a mob out there,

37:12.820 --> 37:14.388
And if they find him, they're
not gonna turn him over.

37:14.389 --> 37:15.989
They're gonna take justice
into their own hands.

37:15.990 --> 37:18.525
If you value your son's
life, you need to help me.

37:18.526 --> 37:20.927
Martha, don't!

37:23.998 --> 37:26.131
Lake Lafayette.

37:26.132 --> 37:29.635
He and Joshua built a fort
there when they were younger.

37:29.636 --> 37:33.038
You'll need a boat upriver
to get there.

37:35.208 --> 37:37.310
Hold on, guys.

37:40.481 --> 37:41.648
Yeah, hotch, what's up?

37:41.649 --> 37:44.684
Ok. I got it.

37:44.685 --> 37:45.952
There's a new plan.

37:55.928 --> 37:57.829
He's heading for the harbor.

38:04.502 --> 38:06.202
Owen, put the gun down.

38:07.037 --> 38:08.604
Drop it, son.

38:08.605 --> 38:11.307
Who do you want to take your
chances with, us or them?

38:11.308 --> 38:12.908
Drop the weapons and back away!

38:12.909 --> 38:14.743
Can't do that, agents.

38:14.744 --> 38:15.744
The boy's coming with us.

38:15.745 --> 38:16.711
It's not happening!

38:16.712 --> 38:17.946
Back down, Keith.

38:17.947 --> 38:19.247
We're in control now.

38:19.248 --> 38:20.549
What are you gonna do,
Steve? He's 16.

38:20.550 --> 38:23.285
Send him back to juvey
so he's out in 2 years?

38:23.286 --> 38:24.486
He killed my mom.
He killed Brenda.

38:24.487 --> 38:26.755
He needs help and he will
be held accountable

38:26.756 --> 38:28.156
For his crimes.

38:28.157 --> 38:29.791
Accountable?
5 people are dead.

38:29.792 --> 38:31.725
Why'd you do it, Owen?
Huh? Why'd you kill her?

38:31.726 --> 38:33.160
You left me behind.

38:33.161 --> 38:34.562
You killed my mom!

38:34.563 --> 38:37.297
She sent you away!
You left and you didn't come back.

38:37.298 --> 38:39.366
8 years and I never
heard from you again.

38:39.367 --> 38:41.034
Please, just let us
take him in.

38:41.035 --> 38:43.269
Sorry. I can't.
I know what you're saying is right,

38:43.270 --> 38:44.337
But I can't do it.

38:44.338 --> 38:46.072
I'm terribly sorry
for your loss,

38:46.073 --> 38:49.042
But please just put your guns
down so no one else gets hurt.

38:49.043 --> 38:51.244
Are you kidding?
You're outnumbered and outgunned.

38:51.245 --> 38:53.146
Who do you think
has the higher ground here?

38:53.147 --> 38:54.749
I'm pretty sure we do!

39:03.325 --> 39:05.227
I don't know.

39:05.228 --> 39:06.395
What are you--
what are you doing?

39:06.396 --> 39:08.297
We can still take him!

39:08.298 --> 39:09.298
It's over, Joshua.

39:09.299 --> 39:10.599
He killed my mom.

39:10.600 --> 39:11.634
I know,

39:11.635 --> 39:12.768
And I'm sorry.

39:15.772 --> 39:17.306
You shot him?
Uhh!

39:18.976 --> 39:19.942
He'll live.

39:45.671 --> 39:52.009
♪ I made a lover's pledge ♪

39:55.513 --> 40:02.018
♪ I made a lover's pledge ♪

40:06.890 --> 40:11.627
♪ then watched the sky ♪

40:16.900 --> 40:22.772
♪ and wanted to cry and... ♪

40:25.676 --> 40:29.947
♪ and you and I ♪

40:29.948 --> 40:32.183
It sucks, doesn't it?

40:32.184 --> 40:33.950
What?

40:33.951 --> 40:38.020
Just knowing that we couldn't have
done any of this without you.

40:38.021 --> 40:40.155
Yeah, pretty much.

40:46.895 --> 40:50.131
I'm proud of you, Penelope.

40:50.132 --> 40:53.668
Despite everything that
happened, you came back...

40:53.669 --> 40:57.338
And you got the job done.

40:57.339 --> 41:01.442
The sight of blood
used to make me run away.

41:01.443 --> 41:04.078
And two nights ago
I ran towards it.

41:07.716 --> 41:11.586
It means you're changing into
someone stronger than you realize.

41:11.587 --> 41:13.922
You cared enough
to risk your own life

41:13.923 --> 41:15.623
To try and save someone else.

41:15.624 --> 41:17.225
Yeah, but...

41:17.226 --> 41:20.595
What's the difference
between being strong

41:20.596 --> 41:23.098
And being jaded?

41:23.099 --> 41:24.733
I'm scared, Derek.

41:24.734 --> 41:26.869
I don't want to lose who I am

41:26.870 --> 41:29.138
Just so I can do this job.

41:32.843 --> 41:37.146
We are in one of the most
beautiful places on earth.

41:37.147 --> 41:39.548
I know you see that, don't you?

41:39.549 --> 41:40.816
Yeah.

41:44.321 --> 41:47.857
Then we have nothing
to worry about.

41:47.858 --> 41:51.227
It's who you are, baby girl.

41:51.228 --> 41:53.296
You see the beauty in
everything and everyone

41:53.297 --> 41:55.065
No matter where you go.

41:55.066 --> 41:58.068
That part of you is never gonna

I don't need you to protect me.

42:00.471 --> 42:04.241

42:06.144 --> 42:08.845
How much longer?
Every day of my life.

42:11.515 --> 42:16.086
I kind of love you,
Derek Morgan.

42:16.087 --> 42:20.190
I kinda love you,
