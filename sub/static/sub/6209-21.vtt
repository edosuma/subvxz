Hey, there's a message
from the Other Realm in the toaster.

21:00.157 --> 21:02.753
Get it out
so I can make an English muffin.

21:02.918 --> 21:04.193
I don't believe it.

21:04.358 --> 21:06.112
Because of the symposium fiasco,

21:06.279 --> 21:08.316
I've been given a grant
to study abnormal phenomena

21:08.479 --> 21:10.392
in already abnormal witches.

21:10.800 --> 21:12.200
[IN FOREIGN ACCENT]
Thank you, boys.

21:12.361 --> 21:15.877
The songs of Bavaria,
we'll never forget them.

21:16.041 --> 21:17.795
She's in
the Lawrence Welk-snap stage

21:17.962 --> 21:19.875
of witch snap. This is perfect.

21:20.043 --> 21:22.115
And now, a little polka.

21:22.284 --> 21:24.196
And a one-a and a two-a
and a three-a.

21:24.364 --> 21:26.357
[PLAYING BOUNCY TUNE]

21:27.605 --> 21:30.564
I didn't know it until now,
but Aunt Hilda playing the accordion

21:30.726 --> 21:32.400
is my biggest fear.

21:33.305 --> 21:39.732
