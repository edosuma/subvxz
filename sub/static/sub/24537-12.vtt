Please welcome your fabulous host,

01:55.494 --> 01:58.573
# There's no business
like show business

01:58.574 --> 02:01.333

I didn't know YOU were coming!

02:02.574 --> 02:05.493
# Everything about it is appealing

02:05.494 --> 02:06.533
Hello, you.

Hello!

02:10.014 --> 02:12.773
# Nowhere can you get
that happy feeling

02:18.454 --> 02:24.253
# There's no people

02:24.254 --> 02:27.213
# They smile when they are low

You look nice.

02:28.494 --> 02:31.693
# Angels come from everywhere
with lots of jack

02:31.694 --> 02:35.093

02:57.854 --> 03:02.453
Thank you very much indeed. You are
far too kind. Hello and welcome

03:02.454 --> 03:04.973
to the third live semifinal
of Britain's Got Talent.

03:04.974 --> 03:07.213
(CHEERING)

03:07.214 --> 03:12.453
Thank you very much, ladies. Don't
go. They've gone.

03:12.454 --> 03:13.693
I was enjoying that.

03:13.694 --> 03:18.133
Tonight we've got eight more acts
chasing a place in that final,

03:18.134 --> 03:23.493
and our amazing prize - Â£250,000
and a spot on the Royal Variety
Performance.

03:23.494 --> 03:26.973
It really is the greatest prize in
show business,

03:26.974 --> 03:30.373
and in case you didn't know, there is
no business like show business.

03:30.374 --> 03:34.213
But, without any further ado -
I love the word "ado" -

03:34.214 --> 03:36.613
please welcome the Britain's Got

Love it.

04:15.094 --> 04:19.293
Come on, judges. Have a seat.
Hello, darling.

04:19.293 --> 04:23.333
That is nice! You look wonderful.
So do you.

04:23.334 --> 04:27.373
David, it's a battle of the Golden
Buzzers tonight.

04:27.374 --> 04:28.653
We have two in one night!

04:28.654 --> 04:34.413
Mine and Ant's against... Well, not
against, but also we've got Amanda's
Golden Buzzer.

04:34.414 --> 04:40.733
Who do you think's gonna come out on
top? I think they are both incredible
acts

04:40.734 --> 04:43.453
and they both deserve to be in the
final.

04:43.454 --> 04:46.493
And lots of other acts that are
on tonight as well.

04:46.494 --> 04:50.733
We'll see, but you can never quite
predict which way the public are
going to vote.

04:50.734 --> 04:52.813
It's a very strong line-up tonight.

04:52.814 --> 04:56.333
Rehearsals today were amazing.
I can't wait for you to see it.

04:56.334 --> 04:59.013
Let's get on with it
and kick off the show.

04:59.014 --> 05:03.773
First up tonight are a group who
combine magic, dance and gymnastics,

05:03.774 --> 05:08.333
and these guys are one of the most
flexible acts in the competition.

05:08.334 --> 05:10.934
They said they could do any day
except Tuesday.

05:11.934 --> 05:14.374
It's Acrocadabra!
DAVID: Who?

05:17.334 --> 05:22.254
ALL: We are Acrocadabra and we are
from Birmingham!

05:25.654 --> 05:28.373
As a dance group we perform in loads
of competitions

05:28.374 --> 05:29.853
and we do lots of shows together

05:29.854 --> 05:32.053
and we have lots of fun
and laugh all the time.

05:32.054 --> 05:34.213
The thing that makes us different
from others

05:34.214 --> 05:38.053
is that we are actually magic.
(LAUGHTER)

05:38.054 --> 05:41.453
The first audition was an unreal
experience.

05:41.454 --> 05:44.093
You've got four yeses.

05:44.094 --> 05:47.333
To get four yeses absolutely
amazing,

05:47.334 --> 05:49.773
especially when you're with your
closest friends.

05:49.774 --> 05:54.693
The other day was really
nerve-wracking. We were
all crossing our hopes... Hopes?

05:54.694 --> 05:56.014
(LAUGHTER)

05:57.854 --> 06:00.493
When the judges said we were through
to the semifinals,

06:00.494 --> 06:03.813
I thought I was going to cry,
and I was speechless.

06:03.814 --> 06:08.053
Now we're here, we'd like nothing
more than to get through to the
final.

06:08.054 --> 06:12.573
We've been rehearsing all day
for our semifinal routine.

06:12.574 --> 06:15.653
There are a lot of things that could
go wrong with our performance,

06:15.654 --> 06:18.293
with our magic, our acro
and our dancing,

06:18.294 --> 06:21.853
but we really hope the judges enjoy
it and feel the magic we do.

06:21.854 --> 06:24.654

in the box who disappeared...

Oh, he's back!

a better start.

You were all brilliantly committed.
I love the formations and tricks.

together. So professional.
Brilliant.

09:52.654 --> 09:53.973
ALL: Thank you!

09:53.974 --> 09:59.933
It was good. Maybe the dancing was
an eight, the magic was about a two.

10:04.494 --> 10:06.493
I'm going to ask you, actually.

You tell the audience why you
think you deserve to be in the
finals.

10:14.574 --> 10:19.013
We've got loads more magic tricks
and loads of acro tricks too.

OK, maybe less magic, more dance.

11:20.883 --> 11:22.522
where all eight of tonight's acts

11:22.523 --> 11:24.882
are desperate to make it to
Sunday's final,

11:24.883 --> 11:27.002
where a spot at the Royal Variety
Performance

11:27.003 --> 11:28.402
is waiting for the winner.

11:28.403 --> 11:30.122
It's a little warm in here tonight.

11:30.123 --> 11:33.162
Our second act of the night
are a fantastic gospel choir.

11:33.163 --> 11:35.002
So David, can I get a "Yeah"?
Yeah!

11:35.003 --> 11:36.762
Alesha, can I get a "Yeah"?
Yeah!

11:36.763 --> 11:38.402
Amanda, can I get a "Yeah"?
Yeah!

11:38.403 --> 11:40.522
And Simon, can I get a "Yeah"?
No.

11:40.523 --> 11:43.282
No, I didn't think so. I thought
that was a long shot.

11:43.283 --> 11:45.322
It's DMU Gospel Choir.

11:45.323 --> 11:49.122
# Oh, happy day...

I'm Bishop Mark. I'm Ella.
I'm O'Neil.

11:51.683 --> 11:55.003
ALL: We are the DMU Gospel Choir.

11:56.923 --> 12:01.923
Being on the stage for the audition
was a dream come true.

12:03.563 --> 12:06.443
Praise the Lord. Hallelujah!

12:08.483 --> 12:11.842
The choir started in 2004
in Leicester.

12:11.843 --> 12:13.762
We've become like family.

12:13.763 --> 12:16.003
We've been through thick and thin
together.

12:19.043 --> 12:20.842
The best thing about being
in the choir

12:20.843 --> 12:22.522
is being part of a big family.

12:22.523 --> 12:24.282
I don't know where I'd be without
them.

12:24.283 --> 12:26.203
I can't put it into words. Sorry.

12:27.443 --> 12:30.682
We are everywhere, singing
at hospitals, schools,

12:30.683 --> 12:34.962
so being part of this competition
really means a lot to us

12:34.963 --> 12:37.283
and we want to make Leicester proud.

12:38.483 --> 12:43.762
I'm so proud of the choir. It brings
tears to my eyes sometimes.

12:43.763 --> 12:45.802
# I have to praise you...

12:45.803 --> 12:48.242
Being in the semifinals of
Britain's Got Talent

12:48.243 --> 12:52.322
is the greatest thing ever to happen
to the choir.

12:52.323 --> 12:56.482
We can't wait to make everyone
in England just smile.

12:56.483 --> 12:58.722
That is our mission,
to make them happy.

Psalm 100 commands us to...

ALL: # Yeah!

13:53.603 --> 13:57.562
Make a joyful noise to the Lord,
Great Britain.

13:57.563 --> 13:59.163

# God of glory, Lord of love

14:09.123 --> 14:13.042
# Hearts unfold like flowers
before thee

14:13.043 --> 14:16.243
# Opening to the sun above

14:17.243 --> 14:21.362
# Come and join the chorus,
the mighty, mighty chorus

14:21.363 --> 14:25.842
# Which the morning star began

14:25.843 --> 14:30.602
# The father of love
is reigning over us

14:30.603 --> 14:36.482
# Joy, joy, joy, joy, joy

14:36.483 --> 14:42.202
# Joyful, joyful Lord, we adore thee

14:42.203 --> 14:45.202
# God of glory, Lord of love

Fill us with the light

# Fill us with the light of day #

15:06.763 --> 15:08.763
(WILD CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

15:22.643 --> 15:24.442
Have a look at that! Have a look!

15:24.443 --> 15:29.562
(WILD CHEERING)

15:29.563 --> 15:32.682
That was amazing. Unbelievable.

15:32.683 --> 15:34.162
Alesha, what did you think?

15:34.163 --> 15:39.482
My goodness. You did fill us with
the light.

15:39.483 --> 15:43.762
Everyone remembers that moment in
Sister Act, right?

15:43.763 --> 15:49.802
And...it's just the most joyful,
uplifting song,

15:49.803 --> 15:54.242
and you sounded so heavenly.
Praise the Lord again!

15:54.243 --> 15:56.803
Love you guys!
(CHEERING)

15:59.603 --> 16:04.882
Honestly, I say this every single
time, but it makes me want to go to
church!

16:04.883 --> 16:08.802
It makes me believe in a god
that celebrates life.

16:08.803 --> 16:12.242
Do you know what I mean? It's not
all down and miserable

16:12.243 --> 16:15.282
and we're not all sinners,
we are human beings.

16:15.283 --> 16:18.203
Praise the Lord!
(CHEERING)

16:21.563 --> 16:25.882
I could tell from the minute
you walked on tonight...
MAN: Praise the Lord!

16:25.883 --> 16:27.482
Exactly.

16:27.483 --> 16:31.922
..you had a real confidence about
yourselves. I could see it before
you sang.

16:31.923 --> 16:35.442
This was so much better than your
first audition.

16:35.443 --> 16:38.762
It was so well crafted.
(CHEERING)

16:38.763 --> 16:42.162
The lighting, the fireworks.

16:42.163 --> 16:47.522
To add to your point, it was more
than just you guys doing what you
normally do,

16:47.523 --> 16:49.242
singing together as a gospel choir.

16:49.243 --> 16:55.442
It genuinely felt like I was
watching a proper West End show.

16:55.443 --> 16:59.242
(CHEERING)
The lead vocal was amazing.

16:59.243 --> 17:03.122
I think why I and other people
love this show

17:03.123 --> 17:07.242
is because groups like you just make
you feel good.

17:07.242 --> 17:10.561
And this is so important. I think
you did an amazing job.

17:10.563 --> 17:13.843
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

17:15.323 --> 17:22.482
I echo the comments. Praise
the Lord, hallelujah, etc.

17:22.483 --> 17:26.882
I thought it was like a gospel choir
meets James Brown.

17:26.883 --> 17:29.562
You said you want to make people
happy and smile.

17:29.563 --> 17:36.242
Well, you have done that tonight! In
the most incredible way.

17:36.243 --> 17:41.442
So, thank you. Pick up your phones,
people at home, please!

17:41.443 --> 17:45.202
Jordan, I saw the rehearsal and
I said you would lift the roof off
this place.

17:45.203 --> 17:49.202
How did it feel? It felt amazing
for me.

17:49.203 --> 17:52.642
Just to see the confidence of
everybody here tonight

17:52.643 --> 17:55.922
that was part of the choir.
It was amazing.

17:55.923 --> 17:58.082
I don't know what else to say.

17:58.083 --> 18:01.802
If I had a hat, I'd take it off.
Well done.

18:01.803 --> 18:04.322
All of the details of how to vote
for DMU Gospel Choir

18:04.323 --> 18:05.762
are on screen now.

18:05.763 --> 18:08.162
The vote opens
when we've seen all eight acts.

18:08.163 --> 18:10.402
Let's hear it for DMU Gospel Choir!

18:10.403 --> 18:13.123
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

18:19.563 --> 18:23.202
Oh! Time for a break,
but we'll be right back

18:23.203 --> 18:27.162
with mine and Ant's Golden Buzzer
act - magician Marc Spelmann.

18:27.163 --> 18:31.802
Plus one man and his tablecloth,
Mr Uekusa.

18:31.803 --> 18:34.563
See you in a few minutes.

18:39.316 --> 18:41.515
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

18:41.516 --> 18:45.831
Welcome back, live, to the third
semifinal of Britain's Got Talent,

18:45.833 --> 18:47.592
where eight acts are fighting it out

18:47.593 --> 18:50.130
for two places
in Sunday night's final.

18:50.132 --> 18:53.571
Next up tonight is a magician
who's probably the most talented,

18:53.572 --> 18:56.971
intelligent and handsome act
in this year's competition.

18:56.972 --> 19:00.731
Coincidentally, he's also mine
and Ant's Golden Buzzer act.

19:00.732 --> 19:03.851
It was one of the most emotional
auditions of the series.

19:03.852 --> 19:06.731
It's Marc Spelmann.

19:06.732 --> 19:10.131
My name is Marc Spelmann
and I am a magician.

19:10.132 --> 19:15.171
I live with my wife Tessa and my
incredible little angel Isabella.

19:15.172 --> 19:19.211
About ten years ago Tessa and I
decided to try to have a child.

19:19.212 --> 19:22.811
It wasn't happening, so we
started to have IVF treatment.

19:22.812 --> 19:25.571
Literally, our last attempt,
it worked.

19:25.572 --> 19:27.971
When Tessa was pregnant with
Isabella,

19:27.972 --> 19:30.771
she was diagnosed with breast
cancer.

19:30.772 --> 19:33.331
It was a rough ride,
a rollercoaster ride.

19:33.332 --> 19:36.051
But now we are on the other side
of it

19:36.052 --> 19:39.051
and we're having an amazing time
watching Isabella grow.

19:39.052 --> 19:41.011
That's magic for me.

19:41.012 --> 19:43.652
That was the whole point of
my audition.

19:45.012 --> 19:49.852
I never ever thought a magic act
would move me like that.

19:51.532 --> 19:53.371
The Golden Buzzer was overwhelming.

19:53.372 --> 19:55.931
I still can't believe that really
happened.

19:55.932 --> 19:58.771
What I'm doing in the semifinal is
truly original.

19:58.772 --> 20:00.891
I've always been creative. I paint.

20:00.892 --> 20:06.411
For me, painting is therapy for the
struggles we've gone through.

20:06.412 --> 20:10.091
It gives me head space. I've
incorporated that into the
semifinal.

20:10.092 --> 20:12.572
When I walk out on that stage,
I'm doing it for my girls.

20:14.252 --> 20:16.172
They are everything to me.

20:17.812 --> 20:20.332
(CHEERING)

20:27.252 --> 20:31.771
Through times of challenge, we often
learn life's most valuable lessons.

20:31.772 --> 20:37.171
When my wife was diagnosed with
cancer, she displayed courage and
a strength

20:37.172 --> 20:39.171
that I'd never seen before.

20:39.172 --> 20:41.731
I asked her where it came from,

20:41.732 --> 20:44.371
and she said, "I just see
the bigger picture.

20:44.372 --> 20:47.051
I see the moment when I will finally
become a mother."

20:47.052 --> 20:50.011
(WISTFUL MUSIC PLAYS)
Tessa's words inspired me

20:50.012 --> 20:52.451
to change the way I was living my
life,

20:52.452 --> 20:57.291
which would ultimately lead to me
being here with you in this moment.

20:57.292 --> 21:01.731
I've always used magic and art
as an escape from reality.

21:01.732 --> 21:08.972
I created this piece 2Â½ years ago.
The question is, what is it?

21:10.452 --> 21:15.531
Simon, I have a gift for you, sir.
These are quote cards.

21:15.532 --> 21:20.331
Basically they contain inspirational
quotes written by some truly amazing
people.

21:20.332 --> 21:23.611
I say they are a gift,
because you will keep these.

21:23.612 --> 21:27.811
But Simon, for now, please choose
one at random.

21:27.812 --> 21:29.571
Say stop as I do that.

21:29.572 --> 21:30.811
Stop.

21:30.812 --> 21:32.571
I will give you the card where you
say.

21:32.572 --> 21:34.091
Hold out your hand, palm up.

21:34.092 --> 21:35.931
I'm going to place the card on your
hand.

21:35.932 --> 21:41.571
Have a look at the quote, but don't
let me see what it says. Oh, wow.

21:41.572 --> 21:43.292
Don't give me any clues.

21:44.772 --> 21:46.531
Alesha and Amanda,

21:46.532 --> 21:50.371
these books feature over 1,000
incredible human beings

21:50.372 --> 21:52.491
who have either changed the world
we live in

21:52.492 --> 21:55.291
or how we think about the lives
that we lead.

21:55.292 --> 21:57.331
Alesha, have a look at this book
for me.

21:57.332 --> 21:59.532
Amanda, please have a look
at this book for me.

22:00.772 --> 22:04.091
David,
you probably recognise this book.

22:04.092 --> 22:07.491
Never seen it before!
It's very good.

22:07.492 --> 22:08.571
I must read it!

22:08.572 --> 22:12.051
There are just under 300 pages
in your book,

22:12.052 --> 22:17.371
and they will create some truly
random decisions using this
bookmark.

22:17.372 --> 22:22.132
So I'll ask you to insert it
somewhere inside the middle of your
book for me.

22:23.692 --> 22:25.452
Can I... Of course you can.

22:26.652 --> 22:31.011
Wonderful. It's important you see
I don't change the position of the
bookmark,

22:31.012 --> 22:34.771
but equally I don't know
what page it's on.

22:34.772 --> 22:37.171
This is a random choice
generated by David.

22:37.172 --> 22:41.931
Amanda, can you look at that page in
your book?

22:41.932 --> 22:46.691
It's important you keep the
book upright. Sorry. Sorry.

22:46.692 --> 22:50.011
Hold it upright so I don't see the
page you're on.

22:50.012 --> 22:53.251
OK? You have the page? Yeah.

22:53.252 --> 22:57.971
David, I will ask you to do
the same thing again. Another random
position.

22:57.972 --> 23:00.972
If you could insert it inside again,
that would be wonderful.

23:02.492 --> 23:05.811
Thank you. Same rules apply, Alesha.

23:05.812 --> 23:09.851
It's important that at no point do
I see the page you are looking in.

23:09.852 --> 23:13.011
Can you turn to this page in your
book?

23:13.012 --> 23:15.852
Keeping it upright so I can't see.
THANK YOU.

23:18.292 --> 23:22.491
Simon, you have read that quote,
yes? I'm going to read it again.

23:22.492 --> 23:23.972
No problem.

23:25.492 --> 23:26.971
Yeah. Wonderful.

23:26.972 --> 23:32.491
Amanda and Alesha, can you confirm
that there's someone you're
familiar with on your page?

23:32.492 --> 23:37.251
Alesha. Is there an author there
you're familiar with?

23:37.252 --> 23:39.731
Yeah. Same with you, Amanda? Yes.

23:39.732 --> 23:41.452
Brilliant.

23:43.252 --> 23:49.251
Simon, it doesn't matter who wrote
your quote,

23:49.252 --> 23:52.611
but what is important is
the very last word of that quote.

23:52.612 --> 23:58.131
What is it? Heart. A heart? Yeah.

23:58.132 --> 24:00.731
I have to finish this piece of art.

24:00.732 --> 24:04.251
Isabella drew a picture for you.

24:04.252 --> 24:06.211
It's in front of you in that
envelope.

24:06.212 --> 24:10.052
Can you open it up
and show everyone what it says?

24:44.452 --> 24:49.772
Alesha, for the first time, can you
tell us who you are thinking of?

24:51.812 --> 24:55.771
Gandhi. Gandhi.

24:55.772 --> 25:00.051
'Isabella, who has daddy been
painting over the last 2Â½ years?'

Gandhi.

Amanda, can I ask you to visualise
your person for me?

25:16.692 --> 25:18.692
I will mix this up a little bit.

25:55.932 --> 26:00.171
Amanda, for the first time, who are
you thinking of? John Lennon.

26:00.172 --> 26:01.371
John Lennon?

26:01.372 --> 26:04.811
What Isabella didn't not realise is
that Daddy hid a second picture

26:04.812 --> 26:06.692
inside this picture.

Well done. Thank you.
All right? I'm good.

26:46.772 --> 26:50.451
Amanda? Gosh.
I will say it again.

26:50.452 --> 26:54.811
I-I don't know how you do it.

26:54.812 --> 27:01.931
For me, even though the... magic...
I will say that, is extraordinary,

27:01.932 --> 27:04.891
of me it's the emotional pull of
what is going on.

27:04.892 --> 27:09.611
I do find myself watching the videos
of your gorgeous girls

27:09.612 --> 27:13.451
more than I am paying attention to
your actual trick!

27:13.452 --> 27:15.411
Which I apologise for. Same here.

27:15.412 --> 27:16.771
So I thought it was very good.

27:16.772 --> 27:21.131
It didn't have the same emotional
pull as your audition,

27:21.132 --> 27:24.691
but it was still extraordinary and
very well put together.

27:24.692 --> 27:27.412
Well done.
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

27:29.612 --> 27:35.131
Do you know what, Amanda?
I think I'm speaking for you,

27:35.132 --> 27:42.091
if that had happened again, I would
say that then you're repeating
yourself.

27:42.092 --> 27:48.091
I think this... I have to find a
different word for this other than
magic.

27:48.092 --> 27:51.771
Magic feels too small for this.
I really do.

27:51.772 --> 27:53.171
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

27:53.172 --> 27:58.611
Magic is like rabbits out of hats
and card tricks. Whatever you do,

27:58.612 --> 28:03.811
how you do it and how you express
yourself, is genuinely unbelievable.

28:03.812 --> 28:07.571
I don't want to know.
I think it's a gift.

28:07.572 --> 28:09.851
Everything you do,
the way you do it.

28:09.852 --> 28:12.611
Let me tell you something.
Everywhere I've gone,

28:12.612 --> 28:14.011
I've been all over the world,

28:14.012 --> 28:18.011
and the one thing that keeps
happening, people come up to me
and they keep talking,

28:18.012 --> 28:20.771
people from different countries,
they have seen your clip

28:20.772 --> 28:24.771
and they all keep talking about it,
how it touched them.

28:24.772 --> 28:27.931
That's a sign of how popular
you are.

28:27.932 --> 28:29.251

28:29.252 --> 28:34.971

really extraordinary.

Mark, you make magic, or whatever it
is you do, beautiful.

28:40.692 --> 28:44.851
It really was such a beautiful
performance, really heartfelt.

28:44.852 --> 28:46.571
And you create such a buzz
on the show

28:46.572 --> 28:49.731

so, well done.

watching you.

28:56.252 --> 28:58.451
I just kept thinking how profound
it is

28:58.452 --> 29:02.011
and thought-provoking, and very
heartfelt.

29:02.012 --> 29:04.891
That's what's important, making that
connection with people.

29:04.892 --> 29:08.451

sometimes you don't want to know.

29:19.412 --> 29:22.491
And that is the magic,
literally, of show business.

29:22.492 --> 29:26.051
It's the ability to make people go
into a world

29:26.052 --> 29:29.491
and it's fantastic and it's just
wonderful.

29:29.492 --> 29:34.651
That's why I really enjoyed what
you did so much. It's brilliant.

29:34.652 --> 29:35.931
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

29:35.932 --> 29:38.411
To see Marc back
on this stage on Sunday,

29:38.412 --> 29:40.891
all the details you need are
on screen now.

29:40.892 --> 29:43.971
Voting doesn't open
until the end of the show.

29:43.972 --> 29:47.971
Ladies and gentlemen, let's hear it
one more time for the fabulous Marc
Spelmann!

29:47.972 --> 29:50.532
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

29:56.332 --> 30:00.251
Next up tonight is a man whose act
involves him getting naked,

30:00.252 --> 30:02.251
apart from a tablecloth.

30:02.252 --> 30:06.811
His audition had it all -
drama, suspense, comedy.

30:06.812 --> 30:08.931
We saw the whole package.

30:08.932 --> 30:11.291
At least WE did, from the wings.
(LAUGHTER)

30:11.292 --> 30:15.251
Don't try this at home. If you do,
make sure you've drawn the curtains.

30:15.252 --> 30:17.452
It's Mr Uekusa.

30:20.532 --> 30:27.012
My name is Mr Uekusa from Japan.
I am an international variety
performer.

30:30.372 --> 30:32.052
"The judges loved my first audition.

30:38.572 --> 30:39.972
But Simon gave me no.

30:41.492 --> 30:46.092
So I have worked very hard to make
sure he loves my act tonight.

30:47.892 --> 30:51.611
I'm very inspired coming to the UK.

30:51.612 --> 30:54.531
British people have great
traditions.

30:54.532 --> 30:58.492
I keep finding new props I can use
for my performance."

30:59.572 --> 31:01.812
Macaroons, great!

31:03.252 --> 31:07.491
"I have practised very hard so that
nothing falls out of place."

31:07.492 --> 31:12.091
Has anything ever fallen out?
Yes, everything.

31:12.092 --> 31:16.411
# Rule Britannia

31:16.412 --> 31:20.491
"Being in the semi-final of
Britain's Got Talent is a great
honour.

31:20.492 --> 31:24.251
I would love to win so I can show
my act to the Royal Family."

31:24.252 --> 31:26.452
Yes, of course!

31:33.412 --> 31:35.611
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

31:35.612 --> 31:41.171
We are not quite ready for Mr Uekusa
at the moment. (LAUGHTER)

31:41.172 --> 31:44.811
Oh, goodness me, are we...?
Yes, we are ready! Oh, goodness.

31:44.812 --> 31:48.651
Brace yourselves, ladies and
gentlemen. It's Mr Uekusa!

31:48.652 --> 31:50.251

Wow.

35:54.932 --> 36:00.731
Well done, Mr Uekusa. Simon?

36:00.732 --> 36:07.331
You are, as Pavarotti was the best
classical singer in the world,

36:07.332 --> 36:11.251
you are the best person of getting
your kit off in the world.

36:11.252 --> 36:12.331
(CHEERING)

36:12.332 --> 36:14.611
I tell why I say that.

36:14.612 --> 36:16.731
Yeah, you need to hear this.

36:16.732 --> 36:18.932
(LAUGHTER)

36:20.372 --> 36:25.812
It's your imagination. You had
a flying car take your thing off.

36:26.972 --> 36:29.051
The music timing's hysterical.

36:29.052 --> 36:31.771
I tell you why I gave you
a standing ovation.

36:31.772 --> 36:36.531
I think this is so much
more funny than a comedian

36:36.532 --> 36:39.051
who is trying to be funny.
(LAUGHTER)

36:39.052 --> 36:42.211
This is the only show you will see
all this sort of thing.

36:42.212 --> 36:44.411
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

36:44.412 --> 36:48.371
And this is what I'm going to be
talking about tomorrow.

36:48.372 --> 36:54.331
It's so nutty, but I found it
absolutely hysterical.

36:54.332 --> 36:57.972
You are so funny and so inventive.

36:59.012 --> 37:02.331
Hysterical and also highly erotic.
(LAUGHTER)

37:02.332 --> 37:06.491
I was worried I wasn't going to be
able to give you a standing
ovation.

37:06.492 --> 37:08.691
(LAUGHTER)

37:08.692 --> 37:11.411
It was a magical act and
I loved the Titanic theme

37:11.412 --> 37:15.411
because it added some romance
to the act.

37:15.412 --> 37:19.891
I would love you to win the whole
series and ruin Simon Cowell's
career.

37:19.892 --> 37:21.171
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

37:21.172 --> 37:24.651
Alesha, very quickly.

37:24.652 --> 37:28.371
I think the men on this panel have
gone nuts.

37:28.372 --> 37:30.891
And if you were to win this show,

37:30.892 --> 37:33.931
it would be the end of this show!
It was terrible.

37:33.932 --> 37:35.652
(JEERING)

37:40.892 --> 37:43.891
You're missing the point. He is
funny.

37:43.892 --> 37:46.211
We're not missing the point.
He's funny!

37:46.212 --> 37:50.451
I've got two eyes, I can see.
It was funny!

37:50.452 --> 37:54.771
I buzzed you because I found it all
a bit small.

37:54.772 --> 37:58.172
(LAUGHTER)
Enough, said, Amanda. Enough said.

37:59.772 --> 38:02.411
If you want to see more
of Mr Uekusa,

38:02.412 --> 38:05.011
although there isn't much more
to see,

38:05.012 --> 38:08.011
just follow the instructions
on screen,

38:08.012 --> 38:09.611
but not until the end of the show.

38:09.612 --> 38:11.931
One more time, Mr Uekusa!

38:11.932 --> 38:13.972
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

38:20.372 --> 38:22.691
(LAUGHTER)

38:22.692 --> 38:24.011
Time for another break.

38:24.012 --> 38:28.251
When we come back, we've got
sweet, sweet music
from Aleksandar Mileusnic,

38:28.252 --> 38:31.291
and off-the-wall comedy
from Robert White.

38:31.292 --> 38:34.372
See you in just a few minutes.

38:38.919 --> 38:40.919
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

38:41.967 --> 38:45.646
Welcome back to Britain's Got Talent.
I'm here with some of the acts.

38:45.647 --> 38:48.690
Good job, everybody. Good job. You
were great. You were great.

38:48.692 --> 38:51.971
Our next act is a singing sensation
from Stevenage.

38:51.972 --> 38:54.331
It's Aleksandar Mileusnic!

38:54.332 --> 38:58.291
My name is Aleksandar, I'm 23 and I'm
from Stevenage, Hertfordshire.

38:58.292 --> 39:00.131
# I'm gonna fight them all...

39:00.132 --> 39:02.851
Before the first audition I was very
nervous.

39:02.852 --> 39:06.651
# Seven nations army couldn't hold me
back...

39:06.652 --> 39:09.691
I'm not blind to the fact that swing
isn't the most cool style...

39:09.692 --> 39:11.171
# Leave it alone #

39:11.172 --> 39:14.851
..but I have a passion for jazz and
swing and that is what I want to do.

39:14.852 --> 39:17.171
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

39:17.172 --> 39:21.691
I actually feel like I'm witnessing
a star being born in front of me.

39:21.692 --> 39:23.131
(CHEERING)

39:23.132 --> 39:26.411
So to receive those comments was
amazing.

39:26.412 --> 39:30.692
Since the first audition my
girlfriend, Millie, has given birth
to our beautiful boy Leo.

39:32.292 --> 39:35.971
He weighed in at 9lbs 6oz.

39:35.972 --> 39:39.772
57cm long. And it's the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

39:41.692 --> 39:43.691
When he smiles it's out of nowhere.

39:43.692 --> 39:45.651
Like maybe he's seen a colour or a
shape

39:45.652 --> 39:48.851
or maybe he's just filled his nappy.

39:48.852 --> 39:50.251
(GURGLES)

39:50.252 --> 39:53.171
I've worked in bars, restaurants,
hotels.

39:53.172 --> 39:55.131
But singing is the only thing I
wanna do

39:55.132 --> 39:58.251
and having Leo was the push I
needed.

39:58.252 --> 40:01.411
I want to show Leo that you should
always follow your dreams.

40:01.412 --> 40:06.451
Winning Britain's Got Talent can
change my life but, you know, one
step at a time.

40:06.452 --> 40:08.452

great. Well done. David?

I like the way YOU worked it.

42:39.332 --> 42:40.891
(CHEERING)

42:40.892 --> 42:43.731
No diggity - whatever that means.

42:43.732 --> 42:45.691
No, I was thinking the whole time

42:45.692 --> 42:48.131
that was really cool and really
classy -

42:48.132 --> 42:50.571
two things we don't see a lot of on
this show.

42:50.572 --> 42:53.371
But was a really, really assured
performance

42:53.372 --> 42:55.811
and a very original one too, so well
done.

42:55.812 --> 42:57.812
(CHEERING)

42:58.852 --> 43:01.331
What I like about you - and I mean
this in a good way -

43:01.332 --> 43:03.211
is you don't have to try too hard.

43:03.212 --> 43:06.891
I think your natural swag and the
way you carry yourself works so
well.

43:06.892 --> 43:10.371
That style is fantastic on you. One
of my favourite songs.

43:10.372 --> 43:14.171
My only criticism is that I think
there's even more in you.

43:14.172 --> 43:17.891
I think we can hear more and see
more cos you're brilliant.
Thank you.

43:17.892 --> 43:19.931
Yeah, I mean, there is...

43:19.932 --> 43:22.971
You have an amazing voice
but I think, for me,

43:22.972 --> 43:28.171
the most important thing with this
style of music is you've got to have
a lot of charm and charisma.

43:28.172 --> 43:30.611
Because when you go on, and I think
you will,

43:30.612 --> 43:33.651
you're gonna have banter with the
audience, girls screaming

43:33.652 --> 43:37.171
and you've got to be able to have an
intelligent conversation.

43:37.172 --> 43:40.331
And you've got it all, you've got
all of it, so well done.

43:40.332 --> 43:42.371
Thank you very much. Really good.

43:42.372 --> 43:45.851
I... You know what... (CHEERING)

43:45.852 --> 43:49.771
I agree with everything. You have a
great voice and you're very stylish.

43:49.772 --> 43:52.411
And I think that with this kind of
music, swing,

43:52.412 --> 43:55.131
you know, there is a limited
catalogue from the past

43:55.132 --> 43:57.451
which everyone's done over and over
again.

43:57.452 --> 43:59.811
I think you've been very smart doing
songs

43:59.812 --> 44:03.331
and putting it into that kind of
area with these arrangements,

44:03.332 --> 44:06.451
which makes you different and it's
unique. (CHEERING)

44:06.452 --> 44:10.571
Er...I really, really hope...
Because I agree with you.

44:10.572 --> 44:12.691
I think that if you make it to the
finals,

44:12.692 --> 44:15.411
this is almost like the warm-up of
what you're capable of.

44:15.412 --> 44:18.211
You're such a good singer...
WOMAN: Give him a contract!

44:18.212 --> 44:21.851
I would love to. I really think that
you deserve a break.

44:21.852 --> 44:25.731
I know how hard this business is,
but this is a showcase for you

44:25.732 --> 44:28.731
and I genuinely hope the public pick
up the phone,

44:28.732 --> 44:31.691
put you through to the final. You
deserve to be there.

44:31.692 --> 44:33.891
(CHEERING) And I really like you.

44:33.892 --> 44:37.211
If that's what you want to do, if
Aleksandar is your winner,

44:37.212 --> 44:39.251
all the details are on the screen
now.

44:39.252 --> 44:42.691
But don't vote yet. You need to wait
till the last act has performed.

44:42.692 --> 44:46.372
Aleksandar Mileusnic! Well done,
mate. (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

44:51.972 --> 44:55.971

turned comedian -

44:55.972 --> 44:58.371
it's Robert White!

44:58.372 --> 45:01.651
My name is Robert White and I'm
doing comedy tonight.

45:01.652 --> 45:03.691
But years ago... (MUSIC PLAYS)

45:03.692 --> 45:06.371
I was afraid of baked beans from a
very young age.

45:06.372 --> 45:08.931
Talked to bushes, acted strange.

45:08.932 --> 45:11.291
But I didn't know it's autism at the
start.

45:11.292 --> 45:14.411
You can't see yourself or smell your
own fart.

45:14.412 --> 45:16.611
# My only friend at school was a
piano

45:16.612 --> 45:19.011
# I taught myself Mozart and Barry
Manilow

45:19.012 --> 45:21.611
# So in my teens music saved me

45:21.612 --> 45:25.411
# But then it went nasty like
ice cream with gravy

45:25.412 --> 45:27.811
# But when it went wrong and chaotic

45:27.812 --> 45:29.971
# I found I was autistic

45:29.972 --> 45:32.451
# But I couldn't fit in even
though I knew

45:32.452 --> 45:35.411
# And I got through more jobs than a
public loo

45:35.412 --> 45:37.691
# Comedy came when there was nothing
else

45:37.692 --> 45:40.451
# And made a good sort of joke from
the joke of myself

45:40.452 --> 45:42.971
# And while not fitting in made
comedy begin

45:42.972 --> 45:46.291

Hello. Hi. Hello, Simon, Amanda,
Alesha. Thank you.

46:23.012 --> 46:26.251
It's um...it's... I have to say I'm
slightly nervous today

46:26.252 --> 46:28.491
because as I was setting up the
keyboard

46:28.492 --> 46:31.651
I noticed that David's got the same
tie as my ex-boyfriend.

46:31.652 --> 46:36.171
And... (LAUGHTER) ..David was
actually the name of my ex-boyfriend.

46:36.172 --> 46:39.891
(LAUGHTER) No, no, not my
ex-boyfriend, my next.

46:39.892 --> 46:41.931
Um... (LAUGHTER)

46:41.932 --> 46:45.651
Thank you. Just trying to connect,
you know.

46:45.652 --> 46:49.491
(CHEERING) Thank you. Gay dating is
very tricky.

46:49.492 --> 46:52.051
You will find out later. Um...
(LAUGHTER)

46:52.052 --> 46:55.851
Particularly for me cos, as I said
last time, I've got Asperger
syndrome.

46:55.852 --> 46:58.651
Although I am aware that if you
mention autism on stage

46:58.652 --> 47:02.251
sometimes audiences can sort of go
awkward and silent. (SILENCE)

47:02.252 --> 47:04.971
(WHOOPING) Like that.

47:04.972 --> 47:08.811
But I was bullied at school. I
remember I went on a farm trip

47:08.812 --> 47:10.891
and this kid got me to kiss a sheep.

47:10.892 --> 47:14.011
Yes. Eugh. How did they pull the wool
over my eyes?

47:14.012 --> 47:16.531
Um... (LAUGHTER)
(COMEDY DRUM BEAT)

47:16.532 --> 47:18.771
Anyway, I had to leave that school

47:18.772 --> 47:21.291
and take up a different teaching
position.

47:21.292 --> 47:24.091
So um... (LAUGHTER)

47:24.092 --> 47:26.291
Or um... Thank you.

47:26.292 --> 47:28.931
Or... Thank you. Coming out was um...

47:28.932 --> 47:31.411
Coming...er...coming out was tricky.

47:31.412 --> 47:33.331
I told my grandad I was gay and he
went,

47:33.332 --> 47:35.731
'Oh, where in nature do two men fall
in love?'

47:35.732 --> 47:37.771
I said, 'Clapham Common.'

47:37.772 --> 47:40.651
(LAUGHTER) Although my nan was nicer.

47:40.652 --> 47:44.171
I told her and she said whatever I do
in my own bed is my business,

47:44.172 --> 47:47.451
which was lovely...until I told her
I'd done it in her bed.

47:47.452 --> 47:51.131
(LAUGHTER) No, it's OK, she was
asleep.

47:51.132 --> 47:53.171
(LAUGHTER)

47:53.172 --> 47:55.291
I'm joking. She was awake.

47:55.292 --> 47:56.731
(LAUGHTER)

47:56.732 --> 48:00.411
Last time I did a song about nothing.
Now I've got a song about something.

48:00.412 --> 48:02.851
It's about fitting in and being
different.

48:02.852 --> 48:05.011
It's a song about the panel, so
ooh-er.

48:05.012 --> 48:08.611
(LAUGHTER) And, also, they made me
change it three days ago,

48:08.612 --> 48:10.931
so it's confused me but I understand
why.

48:10.932 --> 48:15.051
But I am up to challenges. When I was
16 I was 16 stone so, as I said then,

48:15.052 --> 48:18.091
you know, life is like a box of
chocolates. (CHUCKLES)

You are very funny, very witty, very
intelligent.

51:45.772 --> 51:48.891
And you were spot-on with all of us.
Well done, darling.

he came on, 'I don't love musical
comedy.'

I have to tell you
you were bloody hilarious.

52:03.572 --> 52:07.531

love

52:07.532 --> 52:09.731
there's always this element

52:09.732 --> 52:12.531
where you think you are going to go
too far -

52:12.532 --> 52:15.571
which reminds me of someone. But I
have to ask you, David.

52:15.572 --> 52:18.451
I talk about singers. Where should
this guy go next?

52:18.452 --> 52:22.891
I feel like he should have a sitcom
or like you guys did with Little
Britain. Yes.

52:22.892 --> 52:27.691
He's just... He's just one of the
funniest performers I have ever
seen.

52:27.692 --> 52:30.811
I have never laughed like that in
three or four minutes.

52:30.812 --> 52:34.451
I can't remember laughing like that.
I think he could go all the way.

52:34.452 --> 52:38.731
Also you've got this quality, you're
completely lovable as well. Yeah.

52:38.732 --> 52:41.451

We've been together five or six years
but only recently brought this piece
together.

53:49.820 --> 53:54.060
The reason we brought it together is
Holly was in the Manchester attack
last year.

53:57.300 --> 54:01.900
The first audition, it was just a...
It was a whirlwind.

54:05.620 --> 54:09.259
I felt like I was back where I
belonged, dancing with my friends.

54:09.260 --> 54:13.579
It's so important not to be defined
by tragedy,

54:13.580 --> 54:16.779
to be shaped by it but never defined
by it.

54:16.780 --> 54:18.779

audition.

54:25.300 --> 54:28.459
I think we're all just trying to
enjoy it while we can

54:28.460 --> 54:31.700
because it's a once-in-a-lifetime
experience.

54:33.340 --> 54:35.299
Holly is absolutely amazing.

54:35.300 --> 54:39.219
Everybody is in awe of the way that
she's dealt with it.

54:39.220 --> 54:42.739
We've had messages from people saying
it's inspired them to do more.

54:42.740 --> 54:46.940
And hopefully tonight people will
watch and think, 'If she can do it, I
can.'

54:48.180 --> 54:51.820
Tonight we're gonna go out on stage
and make Manchester proud of us.

57:38.140 --> 57:40.179
and it was a really good audition,

57:40.180 --> 57:44.219
but now I can see that you are
fantastic dancers as well.

57:44.220 --> 57:46.340
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
And, Holly,

57:47.340 --> 57:50.779
tonight you, for me, have come on
leaps and bounds.

57:50.780 --> 57:54.019
Your recovery looks like it's going
really, really well.

57:54.020 --> 57:56.059
You did SO well.

57:56.060 --> 58:01.059
You did yourselves and Manchester
proud, so well done. Really good.

58:01.060 --> 58:05.379
Look, Holly, you know, this audition
made a big impact for everybody.

58:05.380 --> 58:08.299
You understand why. I would think
the last thing

58:08.300 --> 58:10.939
you were thinking about, all those
months ago,

58:10.940 --> 58:14.779
that maybe in a year's time you were
gonna be on this stage

58:14.780 --> 58:17.339
with your friends doing something
like this.

58:17.340 --> 58:19.499
So what you've done, trust me...

58:19.500 --> 58:21.420
(CHEERING) ..is...

58:22.420 --> 58:26.539
..is, you know, through
your friendship, through your
perseverance

58:26.540 --> 58:31.179
and an unbelievable attitude, you
whatever happens, have won.

58:31.180 --> 58:34.819
That's the most important thing.
(CHEERING) Thank you, Simon.

58:34.820 --> 58:38.139
I am genuinely in awe.

58:38.140 --> 58:40.939
I am proud of all of you, by the
way,

58:40.940 --> 58:43.259
because that was fantastic.

58:43.260 --> 58:45.859
I have total respect and admiration.

58:45.860 --> 58:49.819
Great choice of song, by the way,
love what you're wearing as well.

58:49.820 --> 58:52.139
Great, great job.

58:52.140 --> 58:54.499
(CHEERING) Yeah. I mean...

58:54.500 --> 58:58.699
You said you wanted to make
Manchester proud,

58:58.700 --> 59:00.699
you've made the whole country proud.

59:00.700 --> 59:04.419
I'm sure this'll be seen around the
world and you'll make the whole
world proud.

59:04.420 --> 59:06.059
This is incredible. (CHEERING)

59:06.060 --> 59:11.059
Yeah, it's so lovely to see you all
looking so happy and confident.

59:11.060 --> 59:14.259
You did a sterling job. Well done,
girls. Fantastic.

59:14.260 --> 59:17.739
(CHEERING) To see Rise Unbroken dance
again on Sunday,

59:17.740 --> 59:19.779
all details are onscreen now.

59:19.780 --> 59:22.419
Don't vote yet. The vote opens at
the end of the show.

59:22.420 --> 59:25.259
One more time, let's hear it for Rise
Unbroken!

59:25.260 --> 59:27.260
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

59:33.420 --> 59:35.819
Time for a quick break, but we'll be
right back

59:35.820 --> 59:38.619
with Amanda's Golden Buzzer act
Gruffydd Wyn.

59:38.620 --> 59:42.420
Plus we will open the vote. See you
for that in a few minutes.

59:47.542 --> 59:49.742
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

59:49.836 --> 59:52.834
Welcome back to Britain's Got Talent.
Our last act tonight

59:52.836 --> 59:57.635
is the Welsh opera singer whose
performance had Amanda reaching for
the Golden Buzzer.

59:57.636 --> 01:00:00.035
Now, his name is Gruffydd Wyn,

01:00:00.036 --> 01:00:03.555
so the big question tonight is,
can Gruffydd...

01:00:03.556 --> 01:00:06.916
do well in Britain's Got Talent?
It's time to find out.

01:00:08.236 --> 01:00:12.155
I'm Gruff, I'm 22, I live in Amlwch,
a small coastal village.

01:00:12.156 --> 01:00:17.235
Not much going on round here, but my
friends and family are here and
that's what makes it great.

01:00:17.236 --> 01:00:20.915
I live with my nan. She needs me to
do day-to-day jobs round the house.

01:00:20.916 --> 01:00:22.795
We argue a bit. We have fun.

01:00:22.796 --> 01:00:26.075
I'll take your advice next time.
Ho, ho(!) (LAUGHS)

01:00:26.076 --> 01:00:29.355
I wouldn't change it for the world.
I've been singing for most of my
life,

01:00:29.356 --> 01:00:33.435
but I haven't had the courage to put
myself up for anything before.

01:00:33.436 --> 01:00:36.796
I decided because my friends and
family were egging me on to do it.

01:00:38.836 --> 01:00:43.155
My first audition, it felt incredible
to see the audience on their feet,

01:00:43.156 --> 01:00:45.156
to see the judges on their feet.

01:00:51.356 --> 01:00:53.795
It was incredible getting the Golden
Buzzer.

01:00:53.796 --> 01:00:56.675
I didn't expect to even get four
yeses.

01:00:56.676 --> 01:01:01.755
My mates, they've supported me
through the hard times in my life.
They've always got my back.

01:01:01.756 --> 01:01:05.035
Tonight, I'm gonna go out there and
make my friends, my family

01:01:05.036 --> 01:01:07.275
and especially my nan proud.

01:01:07.276 --> 01:01:11.956
You're a great boy, Gruff. I'm so
proud of you. And my dream's come
true.

01:01:13.356 --> 01:01:15.356
All the best.

01:01:19.556 --> 01:01:21.556

(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

01:03:52.876 --> 01:03:54.996
Wow. (LAUGHS) Wow.

01:04:06.716 --> 01:04:09.875
Amanda, what did you think?
Ohh, Gruff!

01:04:09.876 --> 01:04:14.595
Honestly, I loved your first
audition, as you know,

01:04:14.596 --> 01:04:19.315
but, oh, my God, how have you
worked? You have worked so hard.

01:04:19.316 --> 01:04:22.955
That was outrageously good.
Thank you. Thank you.

01:04:22.956 --> 01:04:27.235
My...my grandad was Welsh, he was
from Llanelli...

01:04:27.236 --> 01:04:31.715
Yeah. ..and I'm technically Mrs
Hughes cos my husband is part
Welsh.

01:04:31.716 --> 01:04:34.235
So you did it for us, you did it for
Wales.

01:04:34.236 --> 01:04:36.116
Well done. (CHEERING) Thank you.

01:04:38.756 --> 01:04:42.475
When I saw the clip back and I saw
your friends in the audience... Yes.

01:04:42.476 --> 01:04:44.835
Yes! Big up, you guys.

01:04:44.836 --> 01:04:46.875
Yeah, you have amazing friends.

01:04:46.876 --> 01:04:51.715
And I remember that audition vividly
when it wasn't going great... No.

01:04:51.716 --> 01:04:55.155
..and, you know, in that final 20
seconds you turned it round.

01:04:55.156 --> 01:04:57.235
And then tonight you've come back...

01:04:57.236 --> 01:05:01.195
You're like our musical version of
Rocky, aren't you? Yes! Right!

01:05:01.196 --> 01:05:04.595
You know what? You've just come
back, a bit of an underdog,

01:05:04.596 --> 01:05:06.835
and you've fought your way to this
place

01:05:06.836 --> 01:05:11.435
and you just gave a really, really
powerful, strong performance

01:05:11.436 --> 01:05:15.675
with confidence. Yeah. You are what
this show is all about

01:05:15.676 --> 01:05:17.676
and good for you. (CHEERING)

01:05:18.796 --> 01:05:20.955
DAVID: Yes!

01:05:20.956 --> 01:05:25.675
Yes. It was all right, if you like
that sort of thing.

01:05:25.676 --> 01:05:27.995
No, it was wonderful. It was
phenomenal.

01:05:27.996 --> 01:05:31.075
And coming onto this show, coming
onto the semifinals,

01:05:31.076 --> 01:05:35.595
we're looking for home runs,
someone who'll absolutely smash it
out of the park,

01:05:35.596 --> 01:05:38.795
and that's exactly what you did
tonight. (CHEERING) Thank you.

01:05:38.796 --> 01:05:42.715
I said to you in the audition that
there is something special about you

01:05:42.716 --> 01:05:45.875
and I feel it tonight. You've got so
much love around you.

01:05:45.876 --> 01:05:49.035
That was epic. You're a new man
tonight. Thank you. (CHEERING)
