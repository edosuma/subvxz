02:58.046 --> 02:59.548
Lisa, get back!

03:05.587 --> 03:06.421
Hey!

03:10.592 --> 03:11.426
Wait!

03:23.004 --> 03:23.805
Ben!

03:39.187 --> 03:41.456
- Please, I don't have any money!
- Stop, stop!

03:41.490 --> 03:43.558
He's not infected.

03:43.592 --> 03:45.293
What the hell are you doing?

03:45.326 --> 03:46.628
You trying to get yourself killed?!

03:46.661 --> 03:47.862
Shut up!

03:48.830 --> 03:49.731
You okay?

03:49.764 --> 03:51.432
- What are you doing?
- Ben!

03:51.466 --> 03:52.534
No, I...

03:52.567 --> 03:56.304
What's going on?

03:57.171 --> 03:57.972
Ben, no!

03:58.006 --> 03:59.941
Come on, let go of him!

03:59.974 --> 04:00.775
Come on!

04:03.044 --> 04:04.145
- Come on!
- No!

05:21.990 --> 05:22.824
Come on!

06:12.707 --> 06:14.743
Hey, food's here.

06:14.776 --> 06:16.277
Hey what'd you get?

06:16.310 --> 06:18.880
Lisa, what's going on?

06:18.913 --> 06:19.714
Where's Ben?

06:19.748 --> 06:22.350
Lisa, what's going on?
Lisa, what happened?

06:22.383 --> 06:24.152
And who's this asshole?

06:24.185 --> 06:26.755
He could be infected, we don't
even know who this guy is.

06:26.788 --> 06:29.023
He doesn't look infected.

06:29.958 --> 06:31.025
Just wait there.

06:31.059 --> 06:32.092
What the hell is going on?

06:32.093 --> 06:34.462
Where is everybody?

06:34.495 --> 06:35.595
- Would someone please tell me?
- Who's that?

06:35.596 --> 06:37.231
How can you not know?

06:37.265 --> 06:38.466
Where've you been?

06:38.499 --> 06:39.768
I don't know!

06:40.601 --> 06:42.871
- I can't remember.
- There was nothing you could have done.

06:42.904 --> 06:44.238
I woke up on a beach and then I...

06:44.272 --> 06:46.407
You woke up on a beach?

06:46.440 --> 06:49.343
Congratulations, this guy
is a complete psycho.

06:49.377 --> 06:52.113
Sam, Ben's dead.

06:52.146 --> 06:53.782
Great!

06:53.815 --> 06:55.483
Shit, what happened?

06:56.517 --> 06:58.286
I can't believe I left him.

06:58.319 --> 07:01.823
Sweetheart, it's going to be okay.

07:11.399 --> 07:12.233
Hey.

07:16.805 --> 07:20.041
You might as well come in...
like you know and join us.

07:20.074 --> 07:22.076
We've got a spare chair.

07:23.978 --> 07:25.246
Come with me.

07:31.052 --> 07:32.586
Don't worry about them.

07:32.620 --> 07:34.923
It's just been a while
since we've met anyone new.

07:34.956 --> 07:37.425
I didn't kill him.

07:37.458 --> 07:38.927
I didn't think you had.

07:38.960 --> 07:39.761
Handing out keys.

07:39.794 --> 07:40.594
Sam!

07:40.628 --> 07:41.696
What?

07:42.663 --> 07:43.798
Look, why don't you sit down.

07:43.832 --> 07:45.299
...into my house.

07:45.333 --> 07:47.335
Where's he gonna stay, huh?

07:47.368 --> 07:49.403
Well, he's not staying my room.

07:54.242 --> 07:57.746
So you really don't know about anything.

07:59.313 --> 08:01.482
Okay, let's start with an easy one.

08:01.515 --> 08:03.551
What's your name?

08:03.584 --> 08:04.418
Dan.

08:05.486 --> 08:06.387
I'm Kate.

08:12.360 --> 08:14.662
How did this happen?

08:14.695 --> 08:17.131
Look, you should sit down.

08:17.165 --> 08:19.167
Who is this guy?

08:19.200 --> 08:21.803
- Huh?
- Shh, it's gonna be fine.

08:21.836 --> 08:25.573
I mean he wakes up on a beach
without any memory.

08:25.606 --> 08:26.908
Does anybody believe that?

08:26.941 --> 08:28.009
Sam!

08:31.179 --> 08:34.916
Well who does he think
he is, Jason Bourne?

08:35.950 --> 08:39.620
There was some sort
of neurological virus.

08:40.688 --> 08:43.792
Everyone thought it was just
the usual media hype, you know.

08:43.825 --> 08:47.661
None expected it to wipe out
half the country.

08:48.529 --> 08:52.466
By the time everyone
realized, it was too late.

08:54.869 --> 08:56.270
I'm sorry, I'm not really used

08:56.304 --> 08:59.673
to explaining this stuff to people.

08:59.707 --> 09:02.543
Is there anything you do remember?

09:03.544 --> 09:04.946
My mom was ill.

09:06.881 --> 09:11.152
She had been getting worse
so I went back to see her.

09:11.185 --> 09:13.187
I was on my way home and...

09:14.088 --> 09:16.825
Nothing.

09:18.059 --> 09:19.727
That's all I remember.

09:19.760 --> 09:21.262
Look, I'm sorry.

09:28.369 --> 09:29.137
Were you followed?

09:29.170 --> 09:29.971
Did you look?

09:30.004 --> 09:31.940
Did you check for soldiers?

09:31.973 --> 09:33.307
Did you see any?

09:33.341 --> 09:35.910
You know we're not supposed to be here.

09:35.944 --> 09:38.712
The whole house is in danger now.

09:42.450 --> 09:43.384
Hey, sorry.

09:48.589 --> 09:51.759
Hey, you okay?

09:52.660 --> 09:53.494
Hmm?

09:59.800 --> 10:01.669
So how does this virus spread?

10:01.702 --> 10:05.639
Well that's the thing, no one knows.

10:05.673 --> 10:09.410
If you survive this long,
you must be immune like we are.

10:09.443 --> 10:11.846
Are you the only ones left?

10:17.185 --> 10:21.089
Most people evacuated to the safe camps,

10:21.122 --> 10:24.692
if they managed to make
it out of the city.

10:27.195 --> 10:30.498
I went in the car with
my dad and my sister.

10:30.531 --> 10:34.802
We were just trying to
get out like everyone else.

10:34.835 --> 10:39.606
People were running into the road,
and screaming, and

10:40.074 --> 10:44.078
attacking each other
and attacking the cars.

10:44.112 --> 10:52.320
And then, one of them
fell in front of our car.

10:57.558 --> 11:02.996
My dad got out and tried to help.

11:03.031 --> 11:06.000
I heard him shout to my sister
to get back in the car,

11:06.034 --> 11:07.835
but they were everywhere.

11:07.868 --> 11:10.972
Then I just heard my sister screaming

11:12.140 --> 11:13.641
but I didn't move.

11:15.576 --> 11:17.378
I didn't do anything.

11:17.411 --> 11:20.114
There's nothing you could've done.

11:20.148 --> 11:21.382
I've seen them.

11:23.551 --> 11:27.721
Sorry, you didn't need
to hear any of that stuff.

11:28.589 --> 11:31.492
You probably need to get some rest.

11:32.826 --> 11:35.763
You can take my room if you'd like.

11:36.597 --> 11:40.768
By the way, I've never told
anyone that stuff before.

11:56.517 --> 11:59.853
I've got a footprint, possible target.

12:24.145 --> 12:25.980
It can't be more than 30 count on foot.

12:26.014 --> 12:28.316
Get Recce sorted and send the UAV.

12:28.349 --> 12:30.318
And get straight on the line to the FOB.

12:30.351 --> 12:31.552
Copy that.

12:38.659 --> 12:39.493
Dan?

12:40.494 --> 12:41.996
Dan, are you okay?

13:05.253 --> 13:06.820
Dropped my spoon.

13:17.898 --> 13:19.333
How's our guest?

13:19.367 --> 13:20.600
Have you got your room back yet?

13:20.601 --> 13:22.603
No, I think he's still asleep.

13:22.636 --> 13:23.604
Come on, hurry up!

13:23.637 --> 13:25.139
- Why?
- I'm hungry!

13:25.173 --> 13:27.741
We really got too fat,
you know even at this time...

13:27.775 --> 13:30.111
You've done really well.

13:30.144 --> 13:31.312
Yeah.

13:31.345 --> 13:33.181
Well, I still do press-ups.

13:39.853 --> 13:41.222
Who likes the vegetable?

13:43.624 --> 13:45.193
Oh, I'm hungry now.

13:45.226 --> 13:46.094
Sam.

13:46.127 --> 13:47.561
Check this out.

13:48.562 --> 13:50.531
- Well, that's easy.
- Ey.

13:55.969 --> 13:57.371
You alright?

13:57.405 --> 13:58.772
Hey.

13:58.806 --> 13:59.607
Hey.

14:14.322 --> 14:16.624
Talk about a conversation killer.

14:16.657 --> 14:17.491
Sam.

14:49.123 --> 14:51.825
Alright, James upstairs.

14:51.859 --> 14:54.195
Turn the music off.

15:19.887 --> 15:20.721
Frank.

15:37.104 --> 15:38.539
Alright, come on.

15:40.541 --> 15:41.375
Quickly.

15:58.259 --> 15:59.727
Oh fuck, run!

16:11.572 --> 16:13.574
Guys, get outta here.

16:13.607 --> 16:15.343
James should be okay.

16:18.879 --> 16:21.114
Guys, let's get outta here.

16:23.984 --> 16:25.619
I'm getting crushed!

16:25.687 --> 16:27.754
Alright, we're going
to have to let him in.

16:27.755 --> 16:29.556
Guys grab a sheet, we're
gonna have to let him in.

16:29.557 --> 16:31.059
Go grab a sheet.

16:33.060 --> 16:35.596
- James you're gonna be okay.
- I've got the sheet.

16:40.334 --> 16:42.870
On the count of three, two, one,
everyone get out of the way!

16:42.903 --> 16:43.704
Ready?

16:43.737 --> 16:45.506
Three, two, one, go!

16:45.539 --> 16:47.475
Go!

16:47.508 --> 16:48.309
Let him go.

16:48.342 --> 16:51.078
Lisa, where's that knife?

16:51.111 --> 16:52.280
Where's that knife?

16:52.313 --> 16:53.514
- Let him go!
- I got it.

16:53.547 --> 16:55.115
Shit.

16:55.148 --> 16:56.450
Now!

17:11.499 --> 17:14.134
Could someone gimme a hand here?

17:44.798 --> 17:45.633
Come on.

17:48.623 --> 17:51.569
I hurt my head...

17:51.611 --> 17:53.177
You just took that.

17:53.677 --> 17:55.366
Adi, stop slapping me!

17:55.930 --> 17:59.284
- Your sister won!
- Shut up, fatboy!

18:03.583 --> 18:05.123
Hey...

18:05.907 --> 18:08.315
- Want a beer, anyone?
- Yeah, I'll have one.

18:08.553 --> 18:09.922
Look...

18:10.208 --> 18:12.066
I know it's a lot seeking.

18:12.066 --> 18:14.433
But we have to find a way
dealing with stuff.

18:14.749 --> 18:16.951
We are good people, you know?

18:20.683 --> 18:22.101
Umm.

18:23.290 --> 18:24.365
Just...

18:24.802 --> 18:28.837
Came to get this. Coconuts.

18:29.203 --> 18:30.777
You coming then?

18:31.705 --> 18:33.469
I'll be there in a minute.

18:34.303 --> 18:37.691
- That is not a beer, James!
- No, it's a coconut.

18:38.537 --> 18:39.903
Don't give me that look.

18:40.247 --> 18:42.613
Adi, stop slapping me!
You messed up my hair!

18:43.711 --> 18:46.421
Adi, stop it!

18:46.421 --> 18:48.558
- This coconut looks like it got face.
- Why?

18:49.115 --> 18:51.409
Oh, looks like...

18:51.688 --> 18:54.418
Cheer you go, little guy.

18:54.911 --> 18:57.474
- This would make a little sweat...
- Oh, what do you now, huh?

18:57.474 --> 18:58.850
Not this again!

18:59.090 --> 19:01.605
Great, I got a slap happy sister
at one side

19:01.605 --> 19:03.807
and a fucking suffragette on the other!

19:04.066 --> 19:06.267
Do you have any idea
how tough it is being a woman?

19:06.267 --> 19:08.929
- Well, do you know...
- Oh, do you?

19:09.916 --> 19:11.909
So, how you feeling?

19:13.722 --> 19:15.129
Getting better.

19:16.035 --> 19:18.404
Don't worry, we'll look after them.

19:18.985 --> 19:20.747
Ok, buddy...

19:23.552 --> 19:24.992
Everybody such a...

19:27.299 --> 19:28.570
Oh, my ass!

19:29.112 --> 19:30.342
Oh, my ass.

19:37.056 --> 19:38.279
Somebody else?

19:42.897 --> 19:45.005
Welcome to the end of the world.

19:46.623 --> 19:48.246
That was fun.

19:50.907 --> 19:55.016
James, I don't mean to be rudeing,
but this is all you do?

19:55.683 --> 19:57.372
Why are you staying here?

19:57.372 --> 19:59.609
Why didn't we evacuate with the army?

19:59.609 --> 20:02.524
Isn't there anywhere safer on city?

20:02.524 --> 20:03.941
We talk about it.

20:04.588 --> 20:08.810
My Granny got a place,
out in the country.

20:08.810 --> 20:11.127
This is our home, we're not leaving.

20:13.771 --> 20:16.699
We're works here, we've got
everything we need.

20:16.699 --> 20:19.475
We've got food, got a company...

20:22.480 --> 20:23.583
We've got beer.

20:24.572 --> 20:25.908
Okay, you clean up.

20:25.908 --> 20:27.847
- Me?
- Yeah, of course.

20:28.139 --> 20:30.651
- Stop like this.
- Well, I'm helping.

20:30.651 --> 20:32.759
You need to chill out, babe.

20:45.531 --> 20:47.002
Heeey....

20:52.717 --> 20:55.242
Just get off...

20:55.452 --> 20:57.350
- This is the time to...
- Oh, shut up you!

20:57.850 --> 21:00.207
Aww, shit! My balls.

21:00.207 --> 21:03.252
So I notice that you getting on

21:03.252 --> 21:05.941
quite nicely with beach boy...

21:05.941 --> 21:07.652
Whatever, Sam.

21:09.514 --> 21:11.173
What! Jungle's up there?

21:14.010 --> 21:16.219
Hey, where's the bottle of vodka?

21:39.555 --> 21:42.284
- Who's the alien now?
- You, baby.

21:42.635 --> 21:44.458
- Chop me a beer?
- No.

21:46.246 --> 21:47.666
Sorry, sorry.

21:47.946 --> 21:49.105
Anyway...

21:49.751 --> 21:51.314
What are you doing?

21:51.818 --> 21:53.622
I think that's a bit cool, you moron.

21:53.657 --> 21:56.435
Why? Why don't you say please?

21:58.315 --> 22:00.394
- Please?
- Alright.

22:03.890 --> 22:05.006
Oh, shit!

22:05.894 --> 22:07.529
What the fuck!?

22:07.794 --> 22:08.759
What!

22:09.219 --> 22:10.658
- Are you okay?
- You bleeding.

22:10.658 --> 22:11.857
Adi!

22:11.857 --> 22:14.693
- James, get a towel!
- I'm okay, I'm fine, I'm okay.

22:17.071 --> 22:21.389
- Please, seriously, I'm fine.
- Hold this on your head.

22:21.618 --> 22:24.830
- Just hold still, please.
- Just fuck off, alright?

22:25.580 --> 22:28.105
Fine, but no one else
will help you here.

22:36.479 --> 22:37.848
Are you okay?

22:39.136 --> 22:40.324
Yeah, I'm fine.

23:39.252 --> 23:41.160
That was my last pack.

23:52.350 --> 23:54.332
Why did she do that for?

23:54.824 --> 23:56.450
She doesn't do that much.

23:56.878 --> 23:58.329
Well, ever.

23:58.329 --> 24:01.822
I'll tell you what,
she was smashing shocked, though.

24:03.082 --> 24:07.198
She's a ballsy girls, but I'm...
Surprised she had a ball to do that.

24:08.789 --> 24:10.392
For God's sake.

24:21.763 --> 24:23.240
Morning, guys.

24:32.866 --> 24:34.043
Oh, shit!

24:34.890 --> 24:36.745
What did I say to Kate?

24:38.257 --> 24:41.228
You mean you don't remember,
"Jason Bourne"?

24:41.865 --> 24:43.514
Mind your head, pond capt.

24:45.641 --> 24:47.113
That's not funny, Sam.

24:57.287 --> 24:58.297
Kate...

24:58.297 --> 24:59.570
What do you call?

25:00.166 --> 25:01.321
Ten thousand blocks.

25:01.533 --> 25:04.577
- 35 million, hit-lock.
- Yeah, George W. Bush.

25:14.359 --> 25:16.591
I just... I'm done.

25:17.164 --> 25:18.040
Alright.

25:19.060 --> 25:20.085
Sorry.

25:40.308 --> 25:42.410
Hey Sam, put your nuts away.

25:42.444 --> 25:43.578
I hurt my tooth.

25:43.611 --> 25:44.579
You idiot.

25:44.612 --> 25:48.550
Nuts are how you get muscles like these.

25:48.583 --> 25:50.118
- You wouldn't understand.
- Woah.

25:50.152 --> 25:52.687
Where are my cigarettes?!

25:52.721 --> 25:54.289
Fucking hiding them from me!

25:54.322 --> 25:56.825
That's my fucking
weed tin, what the hell?

25:56.859 --> 25:59.327
Where are my cigarettes?

25:59.361 --> 26:01.063
I don't know.

26:01.096 --> 26:03.365
You had them last, where are they?

26:03.398 --> 26:04.733
Jesus!

26:04.767 --> 26:06.334
Oh, you fucking jerk!

26:06.368 --> 26:07.201
Hey, calm down!

26:08.382 --> 26:10.143
I'm sorry about last night.

26:12.084 --> 26:14.200
Why did Adi hit you?

26:15.660 --> 26:17.329
I don't know.

26:20.280 --> 26:21.626
Okay.

26:25.475 --> 26:29.070
- I've never good in talking.
- Yeah, I noticed.

26:33.202 --> 26:35.203
- He has them, I know he has them!
- Whoa.

26:35.636 --> 26:37.338
Jesus Christ. I sworn

26:37.372 --> 26:38.205
I had one about half an hour ago.

26:38.206 --> 26:39.340
I put the rest of them back.

26:39.374 --> 26:40.707
- Where are they now then?
- Where you had them before.

26:40.708 --> 26:42.543
I've looked everywhere, they're nowhere!

26:42.577 --> 26:43.410
What's wrong with you?

26:43.411 --> 26:45.212
- Ugh!
- Hey, what the hell are you doing?

26:45.213 --> 26:47.548
You have them, just give them back!

26:47.582 --> 26:49.149
When the hell did
you become this strong?

26:49.150 --> 26:50.685
- Get off me, Sam!
- Whoa, whoa.

26:50.718 --> 26:52.587
- Adi, that's enough!
- How dare you, prick!

26:52.620 --> 26:53.755
I know you're my sister,

26:53.789 --> 26:55.456
but you do not talk to me like that!

26:55.490 --> 26:56.825
Please calm down.

26:56.858 --> 26:59.594
I wanna let go of you
but stop struggling!

26:59.627 --> 27:01.262
Listen to me.

27:01.296 --> 27:03.064
Why are you acting like this?

27:03.098 --> 27:04.532
Give me my cigarettes!

27:04.565 --> 27:06.667
Why are you lying to me?

27:06.701 --> 27:08.804
No one's lying to you.

27:08.837 --> 27:10.605
Stop struggling.

27:10.638 --> 27:11.973
Stop struggling.

27:18.379 --> 27:19.981
Thanks for that, by the way.

27:20.015 --> 27:21.248
Thought she was gonna fuck bollocks off

27:21.249 --> 27:22.851
for a second there.

27:32.627 --> 27:33.428
She's fine.

27:33.461 --> 27:35.462
She's just a little... she's tense.

27:36.597 --> 27:38.399
There's something definitely not right.

27:38.433 --> 27:39.600
Kate's got a point.

27:39.634 --> 27:41.970
What point does Kate have?

27:43.604 --> 27:45.040
I'm saying nothing.

27:45.073 --> 27:45.941
No you're not,

27:45.974 --> 27:46.807
- that's right.
- Sorry, okay?

27:46.808 --> 27:49.310
You're saying nothing.

27:51.779 --> 27:56.284
I think maybe you need to
just have a chat or something.

28:49.871 --> 28:50.705
Hey.

28:58.379 --> 28:59.414
How are you?

28:59.447 --> 29:01.682
How are you doing?

29:01.716 --> 29:03.118
I'm fine.

29:04.519 --> 29:07.155
You don't really look it, Adi.

29:10.391 --> 29:13.828
You're acting very violent
at the moment.

29:15.063 --> 29:17.765
I mean, your skin's really blotchy

29:17.798 --> 29:21.002
and you're angry all the
time, I'm just worried.

29:21.036 --> 29:22.403
Is it 'cause you're stuck indoors?

29:22.437 --> 29:23.538
What's wrong?

29:29.044 --> 29:33.348
I really think you should go, Sam.

29:33.381 --> 29:37.318
Your eyes,

29:37.352 --> 29:38.619
can I see them?

29:44.392 --> 29:46.394
Get out, please?

29:51.699 --> 29:53.434
How the fuck did this happen?

29:53.468 --> 29:54.302
Get out!

29:55.536 --> 29:56.837
Do you think she's turned?

29:56.871 --> 29:57.705
No.

29:58.739 --> 30:01.142
She's not coping with it well.

30:01.176 --> 30:03.478
She'll be fine, she just needs rest.

30:03.511 --> 30:05.480
Well, I hope so.

30:05.513 --> 30:06.347
No!

30:08.984 --> 30:10.818
Let me look at them, let me see.

30:12.387 --> 30:16.691
No!

30:16.724 --> 30:17.525
Guys!

30:17.558 --> 30:19.060
Guys, get in here!

30:20.561 --> 30:21.929
She's infected.

30:21.963 --> 30:23.864
- We gotta get her arms.
- Okay.

30:29.570 --> 30:31.372
Adi, calm down, please.

30:40.081 --> 30:42.317
She's not moving anymore.

30:46.321 --> 30:48.423
She's got a pulse.

30:48.456 --> 30:50.625
Help me carry her.

31:35.203 --> 31:37.405
Is she ever gonna stop?

31:37.438 --> 31:38.273
No.

31:40.575 --> 31:41.809
Can't we help her?

31:41.842 --> 31:42.877
What can we do?

31:42.910 --> 31:46.081
There's only one way
to help her, isn't there?

31:50.918 --> 31:54.922
If it was any one of us,
we know what he'd done.

31:58.793 --> 32:01.629
And he would've done it already.

32:06.301 --> 32:07.568
Where are you going?

32:07.602 --> 32:09.770
I'm going to the toilet.

33:52.507 --> 33:53.708
Open the window!

33:53.741 --> 33:56.143
- Get her off!
- Club her off.

34:35.350 --> 34:36.183
Sam.

34:38.353 --> 34:39.254
Let her go.

35:13.187 --> 35:14.555
Good book?

35:14.589 --> 35:16.090
Yeah.

35:16.123 --> 35:18.058
Yup, really good.

35:18.092 --> 35:19.294
Really good.

35:19.327 --> 35:21.529
Treasure Island, huh?

35:21.562 --> 35:25.733
That's right.

35:44.018 --> 35:46.754
Oh, almost.

35:50.325 --> 35:51.792
'Sup mate?

35:51.826 --> 35:53.093
You alright, Stephen?

35:53.127 --> 35:53.961
Mmhm.

36:13.614 --> 36:15.182
You alright guys?

36:20.154 --> 36:21.188
What are you up to?

36:21.221 --> 36:22.990
Hitting that snail.

36:31.065 --> 36:32.166
That one?

36:32.199 --> 36:33.033
Yup.

37:09.770 --> 37:11.205
What you doing?

37:13.541 --> 37:15.776
Oh, something about suicide.

37:17.545 --> 37:20.715
Come on, you can't go out there.

37:20.748 --> 37:23.751
If I stay here I'm gonna kill him.

37:24.885 --> 37:26.821
Just give it a bit of time okay?

37:26.854 --> 37:27.688
Wait.

37:29.056 --> 37:29.890
Shit.

37:39.734 --> 37:41.869
Where's he gone?

37:41.902 --> 37:43.704
Just gone out for a bit.

37:43.738 --> 37:44.572
What?

37:53.280 --> 37:54.815
Where's the food?

37:54.849 --> 37:57.017
We ate it, James.

38:01.422 --> 38:03.257
We got nothing then.

38:09.730 --> 38:11.666
Well let's go get some.

38:12.700 --> 38:14.635
There's a Harpers on
the other side of town.

38:14.669 --> 38:16.437
But look how far away that is.

38:16.471 --> 38:17.872
We're here.

38:17.905 --> 38:19.574
So, we'll just cut across Queen's Park.

38:19.607 --> 38:20.575
I mean there's enough of us.

38:20.608 --> 38:21.342
Cool, okay.

38:21.376 --> 38:24.745
I think I'll stay here
and guard the house.

38:24.779 --> 38:26.514
Yeah, okay.

38:26.547 --> 38:27.515
Let's do it.

38:27.548 --> 38:29.850
- Fine, let's go.
- Okay, let's go.

38:29.884 --> 38:32.252
I'm staying here.

38:32.286 --> 38:33.988
I'm staying here.

40:41.448 --> 40:42.617
Why is it so quiet?

41:40.174 --> 41:41.541
Great, now what?

41:41.575 --> 41:42.977
James, shut up.

41:43.944 --> 41:45.544
Oh come on guys, we've
seen worse than that.

41:45.545 --> 41:47.247
Let's find another way in.

43:35.422 --> 43:37.591
Lotus, I just entered into the building.

43:37.624 --> 43:39.426
Watch your line of fire.

43:39.459 --> 43:41.128
Eyes and ears, lads.

44:01.148 --> 44:04.718
- There's some stairs over here.
- No, room staff from this way.

44:09.723 --> 44:13.627
Oh, shit!

44:14.761 --> 44:15.595
Soldiers.

44:20.968 --> 44:23.570
What are we gonna do?

44:25.539 --> 44:28.375
We're gonna have to go this way.

44:29.509 --> 44:31.678
Where are we gonna meet?

44:33.447 --> 44:34.949
Back at the house.

44:41.155 --> 44:41.989
Okay.

44:47.895 --> 44:48.728
Halt!

44:53.000 --> 44:54.001
The Alpha Team that way.

45:15.422 --> 45:16.857
Take the corners!

45:19.359 --> 45:21.996
Exit east side, ground floor!

47:03.730 --> 47:06.466
Have Dan and Lisa got back yet?

47:12.772 --> 47:13.940
Look, Dan.

47:13.974 --> 47:15.142
Oh, it's not right.

47:15.175 --> 47:16.443
We need it.

47:16.476 --> 47:17.978
Can't believe...

47:38.465 --> 47:40.867
Target sighted with Caucasian female.

47:40.900 --> 47:42.869
Permission to fire, over.

47:42.902 --> 47:44.004
Proceed with orders.

47:44.038 --> 47:45.472
Copy that, out.

47:55.249 --> 47:56.083
Dan!

48:02.922 --> 48:04.024
No I'm not guessing,

48:04.058 --> 48:05.758
I'm telling you they're alive.

48:05.759 --> 48:10.464
You're asking me to do is
risk everyone in here for them.

48:10.497 --> 48:12.099
We have to go and find them.

48:12.132 --> 48:13.367
They're our friends.

48:13.400 --> 48:15.902
Well, they're probably dead.

48:32.052 --> 48:34.221
Alright come on, let's go.

48:35.555 --> 48:36.556
That's what you want.

49:14.428 --> 49:15.929
Guys, get your shit together now!

49:15.962 --> 49:17.464
We are leaving!

49:17.497 --> 49:18.865
Where are we going?

49:18.898 --> 49:20.234
James' gram's!

49:37.284 --> 49:39.353
We're gonna need weapons!

49:44.158 --> 49:44.991
Shit.

49:46.360 --> 49:47.827
Everything?

49:47.861 --> 49:48.695
Uh huh.

50:01.208 --> 50:03.710
Where are the knives?

50:09.316 --> 50:10.217
Oh, shit.

50:12.051 --> 50:14.254
Back door, back door, let's go now!

50:14.288 --> 50:15.922
- Stephen, Treasure Island.
- Thank you.

50:31.671 --> 50:33.773
Get up, come on, quick!

50:37.477 --> 50:40.214
Come on, come on, get up, get up.

50:55.762 --> 50:56.563
Come on!

51:02.336 --> 51:03.169
Halt!

51:04.838 --> 51:07.040
Shit!

51:07.073 --> 51:08.808
Come on, Satch.

51:08.842 --> 51:10.344
Come on.

51:21.788 --> 51:23.723
Target neutralized.

51:23.757 --> 51:26.593
Kid wasn't coming for tea neither.

51:31.898 --> 51:33.667
All units on standby.

51:33.700 --> 51:35.669
A group of unidentified...

51:52.118 --> 51:55.889
Scratch that, target's on the move.

51:55.922 --> 51:58.925
Shit.

53:49.436 --> 53:50.870
Bravo Six, what's your position?

53:50.904 --> 53:51.738
Over.

53:54.941 --> 53:56.981
Bravo Six we didn't copy
that, what's your position?

53:57.010 --> 53:57.811
Over.

55:08.848 --> 55:11.485
All units standby, over.

55:11.518 --> 55:12.452
Can you repeat last transmission?

55:12.486 --> 55:13.419
Over.

55:13.453 --> 55:14.353
I repeat, Bravo Six is down.

55:14.387 --> 55:18.091
All units standby.

55:18.124 --> 55:20.860
Roger that, out.

55:20.894 --> 55:23.830
Wait for transport, standing by.

55:23.863 --> 55:25.565
Channel seven.

55:25.599 --> 55:27.901
This is an air support channel only.

55:27.934 --> 55:28.835
Copy that.

55:28.868 --> 55:29.969
Sorry, darling.

55:30.003 --> 55:32.639
Romeo zero-niner for hotel one,

55:32.672 --> 55:34.508
we're losing visuals from the heli

55:34.541 --> 55:36.810
heading west past Enterprise Point.

55:36.843 --> 55:38.344
Is there anyone on the ground?

55:38.377 --> 55:39.212
Over.

55:40.547 --> 55:42.982
Romeo zero-niner continue search.

55:43.016 --> 55:44.951
Targets remain a priority.

56:00.567 --> 56:03.570
Why are they still chasing us?

56:03.603 --> 56:06.205
We're gonna have to
wait for it to go past.

56:06.239 --> 56:07.907
Let's just stay put.

56:22.421 --> 56:24.924
Alright, back, back, get back!

56:35.334 --> 56:36.803
Dan!

56:36.836 --> 56:37.671
Fuck.

56:39.205 --> 56:42.041
That helicopter's following you.

56:44.978 --> 56:45.812
Lisa?

57:00.193 --> 57:01.460
Not that way.

57:05.064 --> 57:06.566
Come on.

57:06.600 --> 57:07.433
Follow me.

58:17.270 --> 58:18.805
You guys take that one.

58:18.838 --> 58:20.373
I got this one.

58:55.008 --> 58:55.942
Get down.

59:01.414 --> 59:02.514
We're gonna have to another way around.

59:02.515 --> 59:04.450
Yeah, we are.

59:24.971 --> 59:25.805
Back up.

59:33.679 --> 59:35.014
Pass me a stone.

59:37.483 --> 59:39.652
When I throw this, we run.

59:47.526 --> 59:48.828
What was that?

59:51.130 --> 59:52.031
Go, go, go!

01:00:03.676 --> 01:00:04.811
Did you hear that?

01:00:11.184 --> 01:00:12.585
Fucking seagulls.

01:00:39.345 --> 01:00:40.179
Guys.

01:00:42.816 --> 01:00:46.652
My feet really hurt.

01:00:48.521 --> 01:00:49.355
Woah.

01:00:51.657 --> 01:00:54.727
You can see the whole city from here.

01:00:57.396 --> 01:01:00.233
I can't believe I dropped my glasses.

01:01:00.266 --> 01:01:01.267
You idiot.

01:01:04.170 --> 01:01:05.839
Look, is that our house?

01:01:05.872 --> 01:01:07.406
Where?

01:01:07.440 --> 01:01:08.274
Oh yeah!

01:01:09.142 --> 01:01:10.143
There it is.

01:01:36.669 --> 01:01:38.537
Did anyone get any food?

01:01:38.571 --> 01:01:41.574
No, there's nothing left remember?

01:01:46.179 --> 01:01:47.246
I got some.

01:01:56.122 --> 01:01:57.957
Nice one, Dan.

01:02:01.861 --> 01:02:04.297
Where'd all this come from?

01:02:10.636 --> 01:02:11.470
Mmm.

01:02:16.409 --> 01:02:19.745
These peas have artificial
coloring in them.

01:02:19.778 --> 01:02:23.449
Why do you need artificial
coloring in peas?

01:03:15.834 --> 01:03:17.136
All units standby.

01:03:17.170 --> 01:03:19.138
Activating generator five.

01:03:19.172 --> 01:03:21.674
This thing better bloody work.

01:03:25.911 --> 01:03:28.081
Can anyone else hear that?

01:03:28.114 --> 01:03:28.948
No.

01:03:32.751 --> 01:03:34.920
What are we listening for?

01:03:36.822 --> 01:03:37.656
What?

01:03:43.429 --> 01:03:45.031
It's nothing, let's go.

01:03:45.064 --> 01:03:45.999
Keep going.

01:03:51.204 --> 01:03:52.404
Shouldn't we be going that way?

01:03:52.405 --> 01:03:54.140
No, there's a safe camp there.

01:03:54.173 --> 01:03:56.842
Besides we're here, so we've
gotta go straight down there,

01:03:56.875 --> 01:03:59.545
up the hill, through those trees.

01:03:59.578 --> 01:04:00.646
Really?

01:04:00.679 --> 01:04:01.747
Are you sure?

01:04:03.949 --> 01:04:05.384
Hang on, which hill?

01:04:05.418 --> 01:04:06.252
Right.

01:04:07.086 --> 01:04:08.087
We came out here...

01:04:08.121 --> 01:04:09.455
So it's about the same.

01:04:09.488 --> 01:04:10.489
No, not at all.

01:04:10.523 --> 01:04:11.756
We've come out from this direction

01:04:11.757 --> 01:04:13.259
so it's gotta be that way.

01:04:15.694 --> 01:04:17.763
No no no, it's gotta be this way.

01:04:17.796 --> 01:04:19.664
We're heading northwest,
that's the whole point.

01:04:19.665 --> 01:04:21.334
We started east then we go northwest

01:04:21.367 --> 01:04:22.535
for the rest of the journey.

01:04:22.568 --> 01:04:23.669
Look, trust me.

01:04:23.702 --> 01:04:25.738
James, we've been over this before.

01:04:25.771 --> 01:04:27.673
Oh yeah, right.

01:04:27.706 --> 01:04:30.009
- He's right...
- Oh my God.

01:04:30.043 --> 01:04:31.277
Fuck.

01:04:31.310 --> 01:04:32.111
Fuck!

01:04:51.930 --> 01:04:52.831
Run, don't look back!

01:04:52.865 --> 01:04:53.699
Shit!

01:04:57.470 --> 01:04:58.304
Run!

01:05:21.127 --> 01:05:22.528
Hold your fire!

01:05:23.629 --> 01:05:24.463
Hold!

01:05:26.665 --> 01:05:27.500
Hold!

01:05:29.668 --> 01:05:30.503
Open fire!

01:05:42.615 --> 01:05:44.317
Get down!

01:05:59.064 --> 01:06:00.733
Stay down, just play dead!

01:06:55.288 --> 01:06:58.891
Come on they've gone past,
let's move now!

01:07:27.820 --> 01:07:31.056
Shit, where are they all coming from?

01:07:32.591 --> 01:07:34.827
Fall back, there's too many!

01:07:34.860 --> 01:07:36.562
Repeat, fall back!

01:07:36.595 --> 01:07:37.430
Run!

01:07:38.464 --> 01:07:40.966
Retreat to the RV, now!

01:07:40.999 --> 01:07:42.435
Stovich, come on!

01:08:05.258 --> 01:08:06.191
Retreat!

01:08:06.225 --> 01:08:07.793
You need to get the fuck...

01:08:07.826 --> 01:08:10.095
Oh fuck, I don't get
paid enough for this shit!

01:08:10.128 --> 01:08:11.664
Move the fuck away!

01:08:11.697 --> 01:08:12.865
Move that way!

01:08:14.467 --> 01:08:15.601
Fall back!

01:08:15.634 --> 01:08:16.469
Run!

01:08:23.609 --> 01:08:24.443
Help me!

01:08:28.247 --> 01:08:31.550
Move!

01:08:34.920 --> 01:08:38.756
Come on.

01:09:02.314 --> 01:09:04.550
Can we go to the pub now?

01:09:09.020 --> 01:09:10.323
Come on, let's go.

01:09:34.813 --> 01:09:35.648
Gotcha!

01:09:39.984 --> 01:09:41.420
Fall back, fall back!

01:09:41.453 --> 01:09:42.854
We're compromised, retreat!

01:09:44.256 --> 01:09:45.591
Go go run go go!

01:10:03.141 --> 01:10:04.743
This isn't safe.

01:10:04.777 --> 01:10:08.514
What else are we gonna
do, freeze to death?

01:10:14.620 --> 01:10:17.856
How slowly you reading that?

01:10:17.890 --> 01:10:19.658
Have we got any food left?

01:10:19.692 --> 01:10:20.526
Oi, Dan.

01:10:21.460 --> 01:10:22.561
- Hm?
- Food?

01:10:24.162 --> 01:10:26.832
Yeah we might have some.

01:10:30.836 --> 01:10:31.670
Stephen?

01:10:32.838 --> 01:10:33.672
Mmm.

01:10:39.845 --> 01:10:40.679
Beans?

01:10:57.262 --> 01:10:59.698
Probably just some animals.

01:11:03.201 --> 01:11:04.837
Come on.

01:11:04.870 --> 01:11:06.639
Let's get some sleep.

01:11:39.204 --> 01:11:40.706
Up the dose to 20.

01:11:44.943 --> 01:11:47.012
He's starting to respond.

01:11:49.748 --> 01:11:52.785
Keep him under full observation.

01:12:18.043 --> 01:12:19.712
You'll be getting out at 500 feet.

01:12:19.745 --> 01:12:22.247
Entering the search area.

01:12:22.280 --> 01:12:23.882
Leveled imagery activated.

01:12:29.922 --> 01:12:31.356
Morning, hello?

01:12:41.166 --> 01:12:43.502
Just anything other than cold beans.

01:12:43.536 --> 01:12:44.603
Yeah, tell me about it.

01:12:44.637 --> 01:12:45.538
I used to be a chef, you know?

01:12:45.571 --> 01:12:46.403
So anything you want.

01:12:46.404 --> 01:12:47.439
A chef?

01:12:47.472 --> 01:12:49.141
You used to be a chef?

01:12:49.174 --> 01:12:50.374
- What can you cook?
- I used to work

01:12:50.375 --> 01:12:51.276
in a couple of pubs.

01:12:51.309 --> 01:12:52.511
Do you do quiche?

01:12:59.952 --> 01:13:03.021
Come on, Dan.

01:13:03.055 --> 01:13:04.256
We eat faster.

01:13:04.289 --> 01:13:05.824
Yeah, hurry up.

01:13:21.740 --> 01:13:22.641
You okay?

01:13:24.409 --> 01:13:26.211
Yeah, I'm fine.

01:13:26.244 --> 01:13:27.179
You sure?

01:13:28.180 --> 01:13:29.014
Yeah.

01:13:30.983 --> 01:13:32.284
I don't know.

01:13:32.317 --> 01:13:35.220
I just, I don't know how to say it.

01:13:36.321 --> 01:13:37.222
When Lisa...

01:13:38.390 --> 01:13:41.894
Dan, you can tell me,
I'm not gonna judge you.

01:13:41.927 --> 01:13:45.030
I found my photo on
the body of a soldier.

01:13:45.063 --> 01:13:46.131
What?

01:13:46.164 --> 01:13:48.934
I think they're looking for me.

01:13:50.603 --> 01:13:52.871
They're following you?

01:13:52.905 --> 01:13:53.839
Sam.

01:13:53.872 --> 01:13:55.741
They're following
you, you son of a bitch?

01:13:55.774 --> 01:13:57.442
- Sam.
- Huh?

01:13:57.475 --> 01:13:58.476
- Sam.
- Huh?

01:13:59.612 --> 01:14:00.646
Who the hell are you?

01:14:00.679 --> 01:14:03.682
Sam don't do this.

01:14:03.716 --> 01:14:05.183
Just calm down!

01:14:05.217 --> 01:14:06.050
Come on, who are you?

01:14:06.051 --> 01:14:08.053
- Sam don't do this!
- Guys shut up!

01:14:08.086 --> 01:14:09.622
What the fuck do you know?

01:14:09.655 --> 01:14:12.324
Sam, just let him talk!

01:14:13.391 --> 01:14:15.093
Sam, let him talk.

01:14:15.127 --> 01:14:15.961
No.

01:14:16.962 --> 01:14:18.030
Sam.

01:14:18.997 --> 01:14:19.832
Come on Sam, leave it.

01:14:19.865 --> 01:14:21.533
This isn't gonna help.

01:14:21.566 --> 01:14:23.135
Fucking stay outta this, you prick!

01:14:23.168 --> 01:14:25.237
I'm gonna kick the shit out of him.

01:14:29.808 --> 01:14:32.611
Dan, you're gonna kill him!

01:14:32.645 --> 01:14:33.812
Dan!

01:14:33.846 --> 01:14:34.947
Dan!

01:14:36.749 --> 01:14:39.417
- Dan, Dan!
- Come on, get off me!

01:14:41.920 --> 01:14:42.988
Let him go.

01:14:43.922 --> 01:14:44.823
Dan, off!

01:14:45.658 --> 01:14:47.860
Like he could hurt me anyway.

01:14:47.893 --> 01:14:48.794
Enough.

01:14:48.827 --> 01:14:50.896
No, not fucking enough!

01:14:52.831 --> 01:14:54.099
I told you.

01:14:54.132 --> 01:14:55.400
I fuckin' told you.

01:14:55.433 --> 01:14:56.802
I told all of you this whole time.

01:14:56.835 --> 01:14:59.171
There's something about him.

01:15:01.707 --> 01:15:03.208
He's why Adi died.

01:15:04.810 --> 01:15:08.714
He's why the military came
and I fucking said it.

01:15:08.747 --> 01:15:11.416
I fucking said it from day one!

01:15:18.691 --> 01:15:19.825
Didn't I?

01:15:19.858 --> 01:15:20.693
Didn't I?

01:15:23.862 --> 01:15:25.263
So what do you know?

01:15:25.297 --> 01:15:27.132
Are you just gonna be
honest now and tell us?

01:15:27.165 --> 01:15:29.034
I don't know anything.

01:15:29.067 --> 01:15:31.169
You don't know anything.

01:15:31.203 --> 01:15:33.939
Yeah, I've heard that one before.

01:15:36.108 --> 01:15:37.943
I don't know anything.

01:15:40.478 --> 01:15:43.782
I don't know why they're looking for me.

01:15:45.851 --> 01:15:49.487
Don't you ever keep stuff from us again.

01:16:15.613 --> 01:16:16.414
Stephen!

01:16:20.552 --> 01:16:21.453
No!

01:16:28.660 --> 01:16:29.494
Stephen.

01:16:41.239 --> 01:16:42.074
Stephen.

01:16:43.308 --> 01:16:44.910
It's gonna be fine.

01:16:46.544 --> 01:16:48.146
Kate.

01:16:48.180 --> 01:16:49.481
You'll be fine.

01:16:49.514 --> 01:16:51.116
It's gonna be fine.

01:16:52.617 --> 01:16:54.486
I'm so sorry guys.

01:16:54.519 --> 01:16:57.289
No, you don't have to be sorry.

01:16:58.623 --> 01:16:59.825
You'll be fine.

01:17:00.926 --> 01:17:03.128
He just came out of nowhere.

01:17:03.161 --> 01:17:03.996
I'm sorry.

01:18:31.083 --> 01:18:33.485
Are you sure it's this way?

01:18:34.819 --> 01:18:36.488
Do you want the map?

01:19:26.238 --> 01:19:27.339
Hey, careful.

01:19:28.773 --> 01:19:30.108
Give me the gun.

01:19:42.087 --> 01:19:43.588
Tie him up, James.

01:19:48.626 --> 01:19:50.895
We have an unconfirmed
sighting of target

01:19:50.929 --> 01:19:53.831
and secondary target
just at five-nine-five.

01:19:53.865 --> 01:19:55.467
Bravo Six I've lost contact
with that boy

01:19:55.500 --> 01:19:57.302
who reported the sighting.

01:19:57.335 --> 01:19:58.936
We're gonna have to move fast
on this one.

01:19:58.937 --> 01:20:00.205
Shoot to kill!

01:20:00.238 --> 01:20:01.239
Seven Three to Tango Two,

01:20:01.273 --> 01:20:04.042
we are on approach to drop zone.

01:20:04.076 --> 01:20:06.278
ETA four minutes.

01:20:06.311 --> 01:20:08.981
Why are you looking for us?

01:20:09.014 --> 01:20:11.349
Why are you looking for him?

01:20:14.419 --> 01:20:17.089
Don't you fucking think I won't!

01:20:21.493 --> 01:20:23.728
He was infected, alright?

01:20:26.498 --> 01:20:28.000
He was infected?

01:20:30.835 --> 01:20:34.406
He was given a prototype vaccine.

01:20:34.439 --> 01:20:39.311
It worked and then he
escaped the research center.

01:20:39.344 --> 01:20:40.178
Did he?

01:20:43.681 --> 01:20:45.683
So what's the problem?

01:20:47.552 --> 01:20:48.920
Look right and the other patients

01:20:48.953 --> 01:20:51.023
were given the same cure.

01:20:51.056 --> 01:20:53.658
The virus just mutated or something.

01:20:53.691 --> 01:20:56.128
Now it's 10 times worse.

01:20:56.161 --> 01:20:58.496
Now even the immune
could be infected now.

01:20:58.530 --> 01:21:01.766
And you, you're still infected with it.

01:21:02.734 --> 01:21:05.637
You could wipe out what's
left of this fucking country.

01:21:20.485 --> 01:21:23.488
How do we know we're not infected?

01:21:25.957 --> 01:21:28.093
Give it two weeks, mate.

01:21:39.104 --> 01:21:40.838
Don't make a sound.

01:21:52.284 --> 01:21:53.285
Dan.

01:21:55.153 --> 01:21:58.823
If I hand myself in,
will you let them go?

01:22:17.642 --> 01:22:18.476
Come on.

01:23:54.939 --> 01:23:56.441
Guys.

01:24:03.581 --> 01:24:05.517
What's up, Dan?

01:24:08.753 --> 01:24:10.255
I'm gonna head back that way.

01:24:10.288 --> 01:24:13.258
See if I can draw some of them away.

01:24:15.327 --> 01:24:16.294
Then what?

01:24:19.797 --> 01:24:22.467
Catch up with you later, okay?

01:24:23.601 --> 01:24:25.870
Dan, you can't lie to me.

01:24:39.551 --> 01:24:41.653
I'll see you later.

01:24:41.686 --> 01:24:44.756
Do what you gotta do, Jason Bourne.

01:24:47.659 --> 01:24:48.660
Good luck.

01:25:00.204 --> 01:25:01.038
No.

01:26:49.180 --> 01:26:50.014
Boy!

01:26:51.349 --> 01:26:52.617
Over here, now!

01:26:56.754 --> 01:26:58.255
Get on your knees.

01:27:01.092 --> 01:27:02.994
It's not your lucky day, sunshine.

01:27:03.027 --> 01:27:05.096
Do you know how many men
have died looking for you?

01:27:05.129 --> 01:27:06.931
Ow!

01:27:09.767 --> 01:27:13.771
I'm gonna enjoy blowing
your fucking head off!
