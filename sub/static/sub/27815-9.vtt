00:21.160 --> 00:23.176
- You're not going to do that.
- I am. I'm doing it.

00:23.200 --> 00:24.316
Oh, my God.

00:26.720 --> 00:27.720
What's it like?

00:28.080 --> 00:30.231
Mmm, really good.
- No way.

00:30.320 --> 00:31.720
No way.
- It's really good, try it!

00:31.880 --> 00:33.394
Try it. Trust me.
- Really?

00:33.600 --> 00:34.600
It's really good.

00:34.920 --> 00:35.920
Alright. Shh.

00:36.760 --> 00:37.760
Don't say anything.

00:42.800 --> 00:44.029
Oh, Jesus, that's rank.

00:44.680 --> 00:46.433
What!
- That is disgusting.

00:46.960 --> 00:48.235
So, we good?

00:49.400 --> 00:50.436
Yeah.

00:51.800 --> 00:52.800
Yeah, we're good.

00:54.840 --> 00:55.840
Yeah, we're good.

01:09.600 --> 01:11.398
- Yummy.
- It's just wrong.

01:12.240 --> 01:13.240
Yeah...

01:16.920 --> 01:17.920
Everything alright?

01:18.600 --> 01:20.319
Peachy. Who's nicked the pickle?

01:20.800 --> 01:21.800
Her.

01:23.040 --> 01:24.918
- It was her.
- Oh, really?

01:25.880 --> 01:27.758
Ooh, how's that?

01:28.800 --> 01:29.800
That's fucking lovely.

01:29.960 --> 01:31.280
Bit vinegary?
- No, no, it's nice.

01:31.320 --> 01:32.515
Is it?
- Yes.

01:32.720 --> 01:34.552
Oh, yeah. Just a sec, let me check.

01:34.800 --> 01:36.678
Oh, oh.
- Oh, my God, that's such a waste.

01:36.720 --> 01:38.313
Oh, there it is. Weird, innit?

01:38.360 --> 01:39.360
Right at the bottom.

01:39.880 --> 01:42.096
- That's disgusting.
- No, it's not, it's not. It's good.

01:42.120 --> 01:43.440
This is delicious.

01:43.600 --> 01:44.750
Here y'are.
- You're a child.

01:44.800 --> 01:45.800
Eugh!

01:47.360 --> 01:48.510
It'll be delicious though.

01:50.120 --> 01:50.951
It's good?

01:51.000 --> 01:52.673
It's really good.
- It is not.

01:52.720 --> 01:53.720
No, it's really good.

01:54.840 --> 01:56.399
You want a bit?
- No, I had it, no, no.

01:56.440 --> 01:58.511
No, no. Feel free. No, sure?

01:59.320 --> 02:00.879
No milkshake left in it.

02:03.040 --> 02:04.793
That's vile.
- Lovely, shall we go?

02:05.760 --> 02:07.353
Yeah.
- Ooh, it tastes pickle-y.

02:07.400 --> 02:08.400
Did you pay?

02:08.639 --> 02:09.639
Yes.

02:09.720 --> 02:10.720
Nice.

02:47.160 --> 02:48.879
Oh, stop it!

02:49.360 --> 02:51.431
Stop it, stop it, stop it!

02:51.520 --> 02:52.520
Mm! Turn it up.

02:53.040 --> 02:53.871

Chico!

03:54.160 --> 03:55.160
Stop.

03:56.480 --> 03:57.630
That's Rosa's truck.

04:00.520 --> 04:01.749
Chico, easy.

04:02.200 --> 04:03.200
I've got him!

04:03.440 --> 04:04.440
Call the cousins.

04:04.560 --> 04:06.313
See Rosa has made it to Nelson.

04:06.920 --> 04:07.920
Whoa!

04:29.880 --> 04:30.791
What's going on?

04:30.840 --> 04:32.320
He's just... he's just checking.

04:33.120 --> 04:34.190
He's just being safe.

05:04.080 --> 05:06.356
It's OK, yeah. It's OK.

05:24.840 --> 05:26.240
Wait, wait.

05:27.640 --> 05:29.950
OK, Anna. Anna, Anna, be careful.

05:33.520 --> 05:34.520
Anna?

05:37.280 --> 05:38.280
Oh.

05:39.600 --> 05:42.354
Oh, shit. Oh, shit...

05:46.600 --> 05:47.600
Oh, my God.

05:48.040 --> 05:49.633
I...

05:55.200 --> 05:57.510
I don't know what to do.
- I know, I know.

05:58.160 --> 05:59.160
Shh.

06:03.560 --> 06:05.040
There you go.
- Oh...

06:05.080 --> 06:06.080
You're OK.

06:10.560 --> 06:12.517
You go... Do you know what,
you go in the front.

06:13.640 --> 06:14.756
Let's get you to the front.

06:20.840 --> 06:22.433
OK, you stay here, OK?

06:34.120 --> 06:35.120
Rosa?

06:37.360 --> 06:38.360
Rosa!

06:41.920 --> 06:42.920
Rosa?

07:41.760 --> 07:42.671
I should tell her.

07:42.720 --> 07:43.720
No.

07:44.400 --> 07:45.400
No, darlin'.

07:46.480 --> 07:47.834
You don't have to do that.

07:58.040 --> 07:59.040
Sarah.

08:03.440 --> 08:04.440
It's Rosa.

08:07.080 --> 08:08.594
I'm so sorry.
- What?

08:25.400 --> 08:26.400
Wh...

08:28.600 --> 08:29.750
What have you done to her?

08:34.320 --> 08:35.320
Rosa?

08:38.480 --> 08:39.480
Oh...

08:41.159 --> 08:42.159
Rosa.

08:42.760 --> 08:43.760
Rosa!

08:49.760 --> 08:50.910
Please, oh...

08:53.920 --> 08:56.276
Wake up, wake up.

09:01.720 --> 09:04.474
Hey, hey, sweetheart. Hey, hey.

09:05.160 --> 09:06.320
Will you do something for me?

09:06.880 --> 09:10.237
Will you run into the field and pick me
the prettiest bunch of flowers you can find?

09:10.920 --> 09:12.400
Go on, go on!

09:13.360 --> 09:14.635
Go on, go, go.

09:17.200 --> 09:19.669
Please, please. Wake up!

09:23.040 --> 09:24.110
Give her to me.

09:25.440 --> 09:27.591
No!
- Let her go, Sarah!

09:32.240 --> 09:33.240
Give her to me.

09:46.440 --> 09:47.556
No!

11:33.960 --> 11:35.030
Hans, come.

11:35.960 --> 11:37.838
Bloodshed follows bloodshed.

11:37.880 --> 11:40.600
Do not quote scripture to me
that I already know.

11:42.760 --> 11:44.160
One of our children lies dead.

11:45.720 --> 11:47.234
We cannot simply stand by

11:47.840 --> 11:49.480
and let the same thing happen to another.

11:49.520 --> 11:52.399
Fredrick, if the time came,
do you really think you could use it?

11:52.560 --> 11:55.917
And risk judgement?
Not only from the Lord but from yourself?

11:56.520 --> 11:59.558
If my damnation means the salvation
of the colony then so be it.

12:00.880 --> 12:02.917
I will do whatever needs to be done.

12:30.840 --> 12:32.240
I'm gonna stay for a while.

12:33.200 --> 12:35.237
You guys can go if you want. I'm fine.

12:36.600 --> 12:38.080
We're not going anywhere, sweetheart.

12:41.080 --> 12:42.080
Hey.

12:43.160 --> 12:44.480
Would it help to talk about it?

12:48.000 --> 12:49.116
Why isn't it me?

12:50.880 --> 12:53.156
Why is it always the people I love who die?

12:55.040 --> 12:56.320
I don't have an answer for that.

12:57.840 --> 12:58.956
You know, life's just...

12:59.920 --> 13:02.116
shit and random
and fuckin' cruel sometimes.

13:04.000 --> 13:05.000
Yeah.

13:06.600 --> 13:07.875
It was the cartel, wasn't it?

13:09.440 --> 13:10.590
Looks that way.
- Yeah.

13:11.240 --> 13:12.240
And it isn't finished.

13:12.640 --> 13:14.233
No. More to come.

13:14.800 --> 13:16.393
Oh, God.

13:17.720 --> 13:18.790
Fuck's sake.

13:20.680 --> 13:21.680
It's OK, sweetheart.

13:21.760 --> 13:23.319
No, it's not. Aren't you scared?

13:23.360 --> 13:25.416
Yes, of course I'm scared.
- Well, you never show it.

13:25.440 --> 13:27.440
Well, that's because I'm your mammy,
that's my job.

13:28.560 --> 13:31.120
But I don't want to lose you.
I don't want to lose either of you.

14:10.560 --> 14:11.755
Won't be long.
- Yeah.

14:14.160 --> 14:15.160
Anna.

14:40.280 --> 14:41.280
Constable.

14:43.120 --> 14:44.120
This is for you.

14:47.360 --> 14:49.511
It came this morning.
I didn't see who dropped it off.

15:21.640 --> 15:22.640
Who is it?

15:30.760 --> 15:31.760
A dead man.

15:32.480 --> 15:33.480
Let me help you.

15:34.960 --> 15:35.960
I owe you.

15:39.840 --> 15:40.840
You don't owe me.

15:41.880 --> 15:42.880
What about Elizabeth?

15:47.880 --> 15:49.234
She's probably in Rome by now.

16:02.280 --> 16:03.509
Why don't we call in the Feds?

16:05.520 --> 16:06.520
You should go.

16:07.560 --> 16:09.074
You should just fucking go.

16:10.440 --> 16:11.440
Who's coming?

16:17.840 --> 16:18.840
Nothing's worth this.

16:28.160 --> 16:29.160
Take care of yourself.

18:22.880 --> 18:23.880
That's it.

18:24.600 --> 18:26.239
Yep, that's good.

18:27.160 --> 18:28.576
Y'know, all those years
when it was just us

18:28.600 --> 18:30.193
I thought you were proper boring.

18:31.600 --> 18:32.600
Charming.

18:38.280 --> 18:39.953
What other secrets are you hiding?

18:50.280 --> 18:51.280
Good, do it again.

18:55.160 --> 18:56.160
That's it.

18:59.800 --> 19:00.800
Keep it on you, OK?

19:02.280 --> 19:03.280
Anna.

19:06.000 --> 19:07.000
Trust yourself.

19:28.640 --> 19:29.640
Hey!

19:30.920 --> 19:31.990
Let's get you home.

Lord bless you.

24:04.760 --> 24:06.752
- I should go.
- No, stay. Please.

24:42.560 --> 24:44.074
Grant us strength, oh Lord

24:44.120 --> 24:47.716
God almighty, creator of all things,
to remember that there hasn't

24:47.960 --> 24:51.317
nor shall never be a time
your love hasn't existed.

24:51.400 --> 24:53.995
For it is love that nourishes our souls

24:54.040 --> 24:55.952
in this life on Earth and in Heaven.

24:56.400 --> 24:58.631
Grant us strength, oh Lord, to instill in us

24:58.680 --> 25:01.673
the courage and faith to endure
that which we cannot understand.

25:02.680 --> 25:06.435
Grant us strength, oh Lord,
send your Holy Spirit to guide us

25:07.000 --> 25:11.119
lest through fear we recoil from living
and dwell in the darkness of grief.

25:33.400 --> 25:35.456
Blessed be the name of the Lord. Amen.

25:35.480 --> 25:36.960
Amen.

25:38.280 --> 25:39.280
It is done.

25:39.640 --> 25:41.393
Your period of mourning is over.

25:41.440 --> 25:42.476
What?

25:43.160 --> 25:44.958
We have absolved you of your grief.

25:47.720 --> 25:50.474
Um, I'm not sure it's that simple.

25:50.840 --> 25:53.150
I wouldn't expect an outsider to understand.

25:53.680 --> 25:54.680
Sarah.
- Yes?

25:55.280 --> 25:58.876
You know from now on
it is forbidden to grieve in public.

25:59.920 --> 26:02.560
Prolonged grief is surely sacrilegious.

26:02.600 --> 26:04.353
Don't touch me, don't touch me.

26:05.520 --> 26:08.672
I understand very well what's expected of me.

26:10.760 --> 26:12.638
And I thank you all for coming.

26:14.240 --> 26:15.594
And now I'll ask you to leave.

26:16.440 --> 26:18.079
Leave, please! Leave, leave!

28:17.360 --> 28:18.360
Sarah...

28:19.640 --> 28:20.756
I don't know those women

28:20.800 --> 28:24.794
but if they knew anything
about losing a child

28:29.440 --> 28:31.432
they'd know there's no way
to control the grief.

28:35.000 --> 28:36.275
A part of me has gone.

28:37.280 --> 28:38.280
The best part.

28:41.120 --> 28:42.120
Love.

28:44.920 --> 28:45.920
Thank you.

28:48.360 --> 28:49.800
I think I need to be alone with her.

28:50.880 --> 28:52.837
Yes. Yes, of course.

29:19.120 --> 29:21.271
Sleep, my child, sleep.

29:32.200 --> 29:35.034
Come, sit with us.

29:39.520 --> 29:40.520
I can't.

30:00.280 --> 30:01.350
Safety's on, you numpty.

30:02.160 --> 30:03.160
Oh.

30:04.200 --> 30:05.200
Dickhead.

30:06.520 --> 30:07.520
Right.

30:32.560 --> 30:33.560
Go on then.

30:39.520 --> 30:40.556
Would you rather...

30:45.200 --> 30:46.759
get eaten by a gorilla

30:49.120 --> 30:50.120
or...

30:50.720 --> 30:51.756
or an ostrich?

30:58.040 --> 31:00.635
I think a gorilla, really,
cos it'd be quicker, know what I mean?

31:02.000 --> 31:04.469
I mean, an ostrich,
you'd just get pecked to death.

31:04.520 --> 31:05.520
Yeah.

31:06.160 --> 31:07.440
I got chased by an ostrich once.

31:07.880 --> 31:08.880
Did you?
- Yeah.

31:09.440 --> 31:10.960
Got out of the car in the wrong place.

31:12.600 --> 31:13.600
True story.

31:15.760 --> 31:16.876
Would you rather...

31:21.400 --> 31:22.720
eat a tonne of rice pudding

31:24.880 --> 31:25.880
or...

31:27.320 --> 31:28.390
a tonne of tapioca?

31:31.280 --> 31:33.397
I've never tried tapioca.
- It's like...

31:34.680 --> 31:35.680
it's like frogspawn.

31:36.600 --> 31:38.080
It's fucking disgusting.
- Ugh.

31:38.720 --> 31:41.872
I mean, I think I'd still have to go
for the tapioca, I hate rice pudding.

31:43.160 --> 31:44.640
I can't do rice pudding.

31:51.080 --> 31:52.753
You are the ultimate noisy neighbour.

31:56.840 --> 31:57.960
They ain't seen nothing yet.

32:04.960 --> 32:06.838
Yes... Rosa would've loved this.

32:08.280 --> 32:11.034
Whey! Yes, yes!

32:12.880 --> 32:15.270
You are not fucking driving.

32:19.960 --> 32:21.076
You're not fucking driving.

32:44.720 --> 32:46.518
We all share your grief, Johan.

32:51.360 --> 32:56.435
A man should have the right
to protect his family, his home.

32:56.800 --> 32:57.870
A shepherd his flock.

32:59.720 --> 33:01.916
So we stand with you, Johan.

33:02.800 --> 33:03.800
Whatever may come.

33:08.880 --> 33:09.880
Sorry.

33:18.920 --> 33:20.912
The first shall be last

33:21.680 --> 33:23.876
and the last shall be first.

33:25.160 --> 33:26.160
Amen.

34:18.840 --> 34:19.840
What?

34:23.840 --> 34:24.840
Come on then.

34:27.159 --> 34:28.514
Is this it?

34:29.120 --> 34:30.120
I guess so.

34:42.840 --> 34:45.230
You know what this means for these people,
don't you, Jack?

34:47.719 --> 34:48.719
Well, I'm not OK with it.

34:50.400 --> 34:52.255
We need to warn them.
Give them a chance to leave.

34:52.280 --> 34:53.679
She's up there with her dead baby.

34:56.760 --> 34:57.760
Here.

34:58.240 --> 34:59.240
What's that?

35:21.760 --> 35:23.240
Did you love him?
- What?

35:26.280 --> 35:28.397
Did you love him?
- I fucking heard what you said.

35:30.560 --> 35:31.560
Just stalling then.

35:31.720 --> 35:32.836
Why would you say that?

35:33.280 --> 35:34.555
Why would you even ask me that?

35:35.040 --> 35:35.871
You love me?

35:36.040 --> 35:37.040
Oh, fuck off.

35:39.280 --> 35:41.317
It's a simple question, Ange.
- How dare you.

35:41.360 --> 35:42.360
How dare you.

35:43.680 --> 35:45.751
How dare you,
after everything we've been through?

35:46.520 --> 35:49.035
How dare you question my love for you?

35:50.280 --> 35:52.749
It's just... you don't care who you use.

35:52.920 --> 35:54.560
You don't care who you hurt,
do you, Jack?

35:57.000 --> 35:58.480
You gave me permission to kill him.

36:00.880 --> 36:03.076
That was... that was a long time ago.

36:04.520 --> 36:07.991
And I know, I know it was fucking hard
for you to do, hon...

36:09.680 --> 36:10.680
but you gave it.

36:12.800 --> 36:15.474
Cos you knew that when the time came,
there was no other way.

36:15.840 --> 36:16.840
You gave it.

36:23.560 --> 36:24.835
I can't think of any other way.

36:28.680 --> 36:29.796
You have to trust me, love.

36:52.400 --> 36:53.800
Oh, Jack.

36:56.680 --> 36:57.909
We have to tell Anna.

37:04.440 --> 37:05.999
One, two...

37:06.680 --> 37:07.680
three...

37:08.160 --> 37:09.160
four...

37:09.680 --> 37:10.680
five...

37:10.960 --> 37:11.960
six...

37:12.720 --> 37:13.720
seven...

37:14.400 --> 37:15.400
eight...

37:16.080 --> 37:17.080
nine...

37:17.520 --> 37:18.520
ten.

37:19.920 --> 37:21.320
Coming, ready or not!

37:28.600 --> 37:29.600
Thomas?

37:36.680 --> 37:37.680
Thomas?

37:50.880 --> 37:51.880
Thomas?

38:43.200 --> 38:44.200
Hey.

39:13.000 --> 39:14.434
Thank you for bringing her home.

39:17.520 --> 39:18.590
The least I could do.

39:21.360 --> 39:22.794
Why are you still here, Mr Worth?

39:24.920 --> 39:25.920
You have a family

39:27.360 --> 39:28.360
a daughter...

39:30.560 --> 39:31.560
You could just go.

39:33.520 --> 39:34.556
I don't need you anymore.

39:38.240 --> 39:39.959
Men like you killed my little girl.

39:41.920 --> 39:43.957
No, men like you killed your little girl.

40:05.760 --> 40:06.760
What's it like?

40:09.440 --> 40:10.440
To kill a man?

40:14.000 --> 40:15.320
I have no idea.

40:16.360 --> 40:17.589
Must do something to you.

40:19.920 --> 40:20.920
Puts the soul...

40:21.840 --> 40:22.840
in turmoil.

40:25.760 --> 40:26.830
Do you remember them all?

40:29.280 --> 40:30.280
The men you've killed?

40:33.720 --> 40:35.791
I have been with men
in their last moments too.

40:38.840 --> 40:39.840
Some were frightened

40:41.320 --> 40:42.320
some were sure.

40:44.080 --> 40:48.199
Those who were frightened
were still lying to themselves

40:49.040 --> 40:51.999
about who they were or what they had become.

40:54.720 --> 40:55.720
Those who were sure...

40:57.880 --> 40:58.880
were at peace.

41:04.600 --> 41:06.319
I'm not lying anymore, Mr Worth.

41:08.920 --> 41:09.956
Nor am I afraid

41:11.360 --> 41:14.034
not of you, nor of any man.

41:16.240 --> 41:17.240
When I die...

41:18.160 --> 41:19.879
the last thing I want to see

41:20.680 --> 41:24.594
is the face of every fucking man
I have killed.

41:37.360 --> 41:38.640
Yeah, well, good luck with that.
