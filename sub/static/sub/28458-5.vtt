WEBVTT

00:01.584 --> 00:05.088
Previously on "The amazing
Race," nine teams continued.

00:05.171 --> 00:07.298
Racing in ho chi minh, vietnam.

00:07.382 --> 00:12.220
The reilly sisters squared off
Against corinne and eliza.

00:12.303 --> 00:14.431
Eliza tried to take our cab.

00:14.514 --> 00:18.643
Colin cruised through the
Road block.

00:18.727 --> 00:21.646
While janelle wiped out.

00:21.730 --> 00:26.943
At the detour, nick and vick
Paddled ahead.

00:27.026 --> 00:30.822
But it was colin and christie
Who finished on top.

00:30.905 --> 00:31.740
You are team number one.

00:31.823 --> 00:33.158
We've come a long way.

00:33.241 --> 00:35.910
A dramatic showdown
Between rivals.

00:35.994 --> 00:38.455
Girls, they're not done, Either.

00:38.538 --> 00:41.124
Ended in defeat for
Corrine and eliza.

00:41.207 --> 00:44.794
You have been eliminated from
The race.

00:44.878 --> 00:45.920
Eight teams remain.

00:46.004 --> 00:47.422
Who will be eliminated next?

00:47.505 --> 00:53.261
It's either move or get hit.

00:54.387 --> 00:55.531
Let's see where we're going.

00:55.555 --> 01:01.603
Fly to the largest city in the
United arab emirates, dubai.

01:01.686 --> 01:04.897
Colin and christie will be
The first to fly 3500 miles.

01:04.980 --> 01:08.485
Northwest to dubai, the biggest
City in the united arab

01:08.568 --> 01:11.154
Emirates, where v.I.P.'s drives
Super cars to the desert to.

01:11.237 --> 01:12.405
Party.

01:12.489 --> 01:16.534
Teams will find their next clue
At a super car tailgate party.

01:16.618 --> 01:17.327
I'm so excited.

01:17.410 --> 01:19.579
I love dubai.

01:19.662 --> 01:24.667
It was nice to be like, ok, we
Can definitely win a leg of the.

01:24.751 --> 01:25.835
"Amazing race."

01:25.919 --> 01:28.546
one of the things working
With us is trying to maintain.

01:28.630 --> 01:30.173
Alignment in the midst of chaos.

01:30.256 --> 01:33.510
As we work on the one thing we
Can control, which is us, we'll.

01:33.593 --> 01:36.012
Be able to overcome the other
Things out of our control.

01:36.095 --> 01:37.305
High five.

01:37.388 --> 01:41.351
We went from a small village
Of 800 people to becoming a.

01:41.434 --> 01:43.061
World traveler and dubai.

01:43.144 --> 01:44.187
Who would have thought?

01:44.270 --> 01:49.150
We have a trio of second
Place finishes and the ever.

01:49.234 --> 01:50.920
Elusive first place is right
There within our grasp.

01:50.944 --> 01:53.363
People think they haven't
Done it before, maybe they're.

01:53.446 --> 01:54.572
Getting lucky.

01:54.656 --> 01:57.867
We're very underestimated but I
Love that.

01:57.951 --> 02:00.411
That's my strategy with
Everything I do and I think.

02:00.495 --> 02:05.333
That's how I won "Big brother".

02:05.416 --> 02:08.336
Dubai.

02:08.419 --> 02:09.336
Never been there.

02:09.419 --> 02:12.048
I think last leg shows what
We are as a team.

02:12.131 --> 02:16.302
We were on the verge of
Elimination and come all the way.

02:16.386 --> 02:19.848
Back to third and that's our
"Survivor" spirit.

02:19.931 --> 02:22.225
We're playing with some
People who have played before.

02:22.308 --> 02:23.393
Now we kind of get it.

02:23.476 --> 02:26.396
This race is harder than last
Season.

02:26.479 --> 02:28.231
More competitive.

02:28.314 --> 02:28.940
It's crazy.

02:29.023 --> 02:30.023
But we're trucking.

02:30.066 --> 02:33.528
Floyd and I, but mostly
Floyd, survived vietnam.

02:33.611 --> 02:37.574
We came into laos as
Strangers but now we're friends.

02:37.657 --> 02:40.118
And that's given us the
Opportunity to be more open with.

02:40.201 --> 02:40.994
Our lines of communication.

02:41.077 --> 02:42.787
That will help us win "The
Amazing race."

02:42.871 --> 02:44.414
going to dubai.

02:44.497 --> 02:47.250
The last time we ran this
Race, we went to dubai and we.

02:47.333 --> 02:49.127
Raced camels.

02:49.210 --> 02:52.630
My god.

02:52.714 --> 02:56.384
Let's see some camels.

02:56.467 --> 03:01.639
We did better with kisses in
The desert.

03:01.723 --> 03:02.515
Your eyes are wide open.

03:02.599 --> 03:07.061
You want to see a bedouin kiss?

03:07.145 --> 03:08.605
That's what we know about dubai.

03:08.688 --> 03:09.981
Dubai!

03:10.064 --> 03:14.819
My god!

03:14.903 --> 03:16.446
Oooh!

03:16.529 --> 03:20.116
We're getting as close as
Possible to the motherland.

03:20.199 --> 03:21.326
I told you that.

03:21.409 --> 03:26.497
We started the race kicking
Butt and then we sort of slipped.

03:26.581 --> 03:29.292
Behind in vietnam but we're
Looking to regroup and get first.

03:29.375 --> 03:30.519
Place, hopefully, out here in
Dubai.

03:30.543 --> 03:34.297
Could you bless us and say
You will be number one?

03:34.380 --> 03:34.631
Say number one.

03:34.714 --> 03:35.965
Say it.

03:36.049 --> 03:36.841
Say it.

03:36.925 --> 03:37.258
Number one.

03:37.342 --> 03:37.884
Number one.

03:37.967 --> 03:39.969
Yeah!

03:40.053 --> 03:42.680
We need to go really fast, Sir.

03:42.764 --> 03:44.098
Fast, fast, fast.

03:44.182 --> 03:45.576
We struggled in the last leg but
Feeling great.

03:45.600 --> 03:49.646
We always try to re-evaluate the
Previous leg but it's hard to.

03:49.729 --> 03:52.941
Implement the changes because
You're so frazzled.

03:53.024 --> 03:56.152
We're trying our best to press
Restart.

03:56.235 --> 03:57.379
Next time we're going to get
First.

03:57.403 --> 03:58.321
We're going to dubai!

03:58.404 --> 03:59.447
I'm so excited!

03:59.530 --> 04:05.995
We're leaving in still
Amazing race play.

04:06.079 --> 04:06.955
Still in the race.

04:07.038 --> 04:09.791
I've wanted to go to dubai my
Whole life.

04:09.874 --> 04:12.585
It's all luxury like my sister.

04:12.669 --> 04:14.545
Elissa could not be a better
Partner.

04:14.629 --> 04:18.466
She's really strong physically
And listens to me when it comes.

04:18.548 --> 04:21.177
To the mental thing.

04:21.260 --> 04:22.136
This is my show.

04:22.220 --> 04:23.262
It's my show, too.

04:23.346 --> 04:27.350
Yeah.

04:27.433 --> 04:29.620
Everybody is on the same
Flight with us heading to dubai.

04:29.644 --> 04:37.644
Dubai!

04:39.000 --> 04:45.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:29.662 --> 05:30.538
Taxi!

05:30.621 --> 05:30.913
Taxi!

05:30.997 --> 05:31.581
My god.

05:31.664 --> 05:37.378
We have directions to it.

05:37.462 --> 05:40.423
All the cabs are in a line
Right now.

05:40.506 --> 05:48.506
Everybody is taking selfies.

05:50.308 --> 05:53.436
That's a beautiful sight to
Take in.

05:53.519 --> 05:55.938
Breathtaking.

05:56.022 --> 05:58.441
Beautiful, beautiful.

05:58.524 --> 05:59.859
Some tall buildings there.

05:59.942 --> 06:03.446
Look how pretty it is.

06:03.529 --> 06:07.283
Welcome to dubai.

06:07.366 --> 06:09.118
We ain't gonna cry.

06:09.202 --> 06:13.623
We gonna stop the competition,
We have a premonition, it is my.

06:13.706 --> 06:17.001
Admonition that we're going to
Beat the competition.

06:17.085 --> 06:19.754
We have approval.

06:19.837 --> 06:27.837
We're going on here.

06:28.679 --> 06:32.308
There's these beautiful
Luxury cars.

06:32.391 --> 06:33.392
A bentley.

06:33.476 --> 06:39.023
Every car out there was
Probably at minimum $300 or

06:39.107 --> 06:39.440
$400,000 car.

06:39.524 --> 06:40.149
Beautiful.

06:40.233 --> 06:41.317
Hello.

06:41.400 --> 06:43.611
Can we have tea with you?

06:43.694 --> 06:43.986
Welcome to dubai.

06:44.070 --> 06:44.612
Thank you.

06:44.695 --> 06:52.695
Who's got the mcclarin.

06:53.079 --> 06:54.664
Some tea.

06:54.747 --> 07:01.003
These cute guys were giving
Us tea and dates.

07:01.087 --> 07:07.176
Diamond encrusted tea glasses.

07:07.260 --> 07:09.512
You guys, come on.

07:09.595 --> 07:12.181
I got it.

07:12.265 --> 07:18.020
Teams must continue to travel
By taxi back into the city to.

07:18.104 --> 07:23.568
The dubai and make their way to
The top of the dubai frame to.

07:23.651 --> 07:25.736
Find their next clue.

07:25.820 --> 07:26.863
Dubai frame.

07:26.946 --> 07:27.655
Let's go!

07:27.738 --> 07:29.991
It was so beautiful.

07:30.074 --> 07:32.869
The bentley had a clue.

07:32.952 --> 07:38.374
Rachel and elissa are way Ahead.

07:38.457 --> 07:40.877
Please catch them.

07:40.960 --> 07:45.381
Have a seat, please.

07:45.464 --> 07:50.720
That's awesome.

07:50.803 --> 07:52.889
Clue's in the cup.

07:52.972 --> 07:54.015
Thank you.

07:54.098 --> 07:57.560
You see the clue?

07:57.643 --> 07:58.311
Just pick a card.

07:58.394 --> 08:01.063
I got it, nick.

08:01.147 --> 08:04.317
Bye-bye.

08:04.400 --> 08:05.109
Hi.

08:05.193 --> 08:05.735
Look at this ride.

08:05.818 --> 08:11.949
I see the clue on the seat.

08:12.033 --> 08:13.618
This skyline is breathtaking.

08:13.701 --> 08:16.913
We are almost to the dubai
Frame.

08:16.996 --> 08:19.373
Rachel and elissa are right in
Front of us.

08:19.457 --> 08:21.751
Dubai frame is a structure,
Right?

08:21.834 --> 08:22.710
I don't know.

08:22.793 --> 08:30.793
Be on the lookout to see if you
See the frame.

08:31.219 --> 08:33.054
That's a nice building right
There.

08:33.136 --> 08:35.306
I see it.

08:35.389 --> 08:36.390
Beautiful building.

08:36.474 --> 08:40.436
It's literally a giant frame
With the center out.

08:40.519 --> 08:43.105
Dubai frame.

08:43.188 --> 08:48.778
Can you take us... is this the
Wrong exit?

08:48.861 --> 08:51.614
I hope not.

08:51.697 --> 08:54.909
There goes rachel.

08:54.992 --> 08:58.788
Leo, jamal, number one.

08:58.871 --> 09:01.958
It looks just like a frame.

09:02.041 --> 09:03.042
Here, maybe.

09:03.125 --> 09:05.086
Do you not know how to get
There?

09:05.169 --> 09:06.921
Go there, go that way.

09:07.004 --> 09:08.130
Try that way.

09:08.214 --> 09:10.359
I don't know where we're at but
We've got to get somewhere,

09:10.383 --> 09:11.092
Please.

09:11.175 --> 09:15.972
If we get lost, that puts us
Behind.

09:16.055 --> 09:19.517
Wow.

09:19.600 --> 09:20.309
You think this way?

09:20.393 --> 09:23.187
Come on, come on, this way,
Bret.

09:23.271 --> 09:24.313
Let's go, man.

09:24.397 --> 09:26.148
Amazing.

09:26.232 --> 09:26.649
Look how high.

09:26.732 --> 09:28.109
Geez.

09:28.192 --> 09:28.442
Look at the view.

09:28.526 --> 09:29.193
I know.

09:29.277 --> 09:32.154
It's like a giant picture Frame.

09:32.238 --> 09:38.369
It's made to show the old dubai
On one side and new dubai on the.

09:38.452 --> 09:38.744
Other side.

09:38.828 --> 09:39.620
Let's go.

09:39.704 --> 09:40.413
Wow.

09:40.496 --> 09:44.000
This is so great.

09:44.083 --> 09:44.375
Look!

09:44.458 --> 09:47.336
Shoot!

09:47.420 --> 09:47.837
Man!

09:47.920 --> 09:49.213
Wow.

09:49.297 --> 09:51.966
Come on, buddy.

09:52.049 --> 09:52.800
A little detour.

09:52.883 --> 09:54.844
Detour.

09:54.927 --> 09:59.682
This detour requires teams
To jump off the world's tallest.

09:59.765 --> 10:04.520
Building, towering almost twice
As high as the empire state.

10:04.603 --> 10:05.730
Building.

10:05.813 --> 10:08.691
First, they must pick a sky
Diving jump master, then ride to.

10:08.774 --> 10:11.861
The top of this impressive
Building on the world's highest.

10:11.944 --> 10:14.071
And fastest elevator.

10:14.155 --> 10:16.699
Once there, they'll have to keep
Their eyes open as they.

10:16.782 --> 10:22.830
Parachute all the way down to
Pick up their next clue.

10:22.913 --> 10:27.877
After being extinct for almost
65 million years, dinosaurs were.

10:27.960 --> 10:32.715
Brought back to life here at the
World's largest dinosaur park.

10:32.798 --> 10:38.179
This detour requires teams to
Search dubai garden globe for.

10:38.262 --> 10:44.518
Five different colored eggs,
Then return them to their nests.

10:44.602 --> 10:47.563
I definitely want to do that
But we have been choosing the.

10:47.646 --> 10:49.190
Wrong detour so my god.

10:49.273 --> 10:51.901
Only two teams may attempt to
Jump at a time.

10:51.984 --> 10:52.276
Two teams.

10:52.360 --> 10:52.943
Let's go.

10:53.027 --> 10:54.445
We're going to do the jump.

10:54.528 --> 10:59.408
I see leo and jamal down There.

10:59.492 --> 11:01.577
That's colin and christie.

11:01.660 --> 11:01.952
We got to go there quick.

11:02.036 --> 11:05.664
Wait, wait.

11:05.748 --> 11:06.290
What do you think?

11:06.374 --> 11:08.417
We're finding five eggs.

11:08.501 --> 11:09.418
There's another team.

11:09.502 --> 11:12.546
Thank you, thank you.

11:12.630 --> 11:13.964
It's that tall building.

11:14.048 --> 11:14.256
Let's go.

11:14.340 --> 11:17.051
Ok.

11:17.134 --> 11:19.595
Let's do five.

11:19.678 --> 11:20.096
How do we get there?

11:20.179 --> 11:24.266
We don't know.

11:24.350 --> 11:26.602
Go wherever you need to go.

11:26.685 --> 11:27.937
We're in a race.

11:28.020 --> 11:30.231
We're in a race.

11:30.314 --> 11:31.941
Now we're behind everybody.

11:32.024 --> 11:34.276
Definitely behind nick and vick.

11:34.360 --> 11:42.360
Come on, nick, let's go,
Let's go.

11:42.576 --> 11:43.953
This is taking forever.

11:44.036 --> 11:46.789
Just go wherever you got to Go.

11:46.872 --> 11:48.916
My god, elissa.

11:54.839 --> 11:57.842
Why's it called the dubai
Frame, right?

11:57.925 --> 11:58.634
We can ask.

11:58.717 --> 12:01.303
Do you know the exit of the
Frame?

12:01.387 --> 12:04.974
Frame?

12:05.057 --> 12:06.308
Right, then again right.

12:06.392 --> 12:07.643
Ok, thank you so much.

12:07.726 --> 12:09.311
Thank you.

12:09.395 --> 12:11.039
At least we got to see more
Of dubai, right.

12:11.063 --> 12:15.985
Yeah.

12:16.068 --> 12:18.154
This is massive.

12:18.237 --> 12:21.949
Everything happens for a Reason.

12:22.032 --> 12:23.032
Here we go.

12:23.075 --> 12:25.828
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

12:25.911 --> 12:27.997
My god.

12:28.080 --> 12:30.499
You want to find the egg?

12:30.583 --> 12:31.000
Sure.

12:31.083 --> 12:31.959
Let's find the egg.

12:32.042 --> 12:33.836
Dubai glow garden.

12:33.919 --> 12:34.503
We passed it.

12:34.587 --> 12:39.675
Do you know where to go?

12:39.758 --> 12:40.426
What's wrong?

12:40.509 --> 12:43.345
Two teams may jump at any Time.

12:43.429 --> 12:45.055
I think we have to find the
Five eggs.

12:45.139 --> 12:45.764
What?

12:45.848 --> 12:48.017
Everyone else can be jumping.

12:48.100 --> 12:50.352
Only two teams can jump at one
Time.

12:50.436 --> 12:51.979
First come, first serve.

12:52.062 --> 12:54.857
I don't think we should do That.

12:54.940 --> 12:56.984
There are 10 teams ahead of us.

12:57.067 --> 12:59.862
I'm disappointed in our taxi
Driver.

12:59.945 --> 13:00.945
It's like so frustrating.

13:00.988 --> 13:02.031
It is what it is.

13:02.114 --> 13:03.032
We're here.

13:03.115 --> 13:07.870
Now we're like...
you know they're going to the.

13:07.953 --> 13:08.370
Jump.

13:08.454 --> 13:10.080
This is amazing.

13:10.164 --> 13:13.834
My god, yes.

13:13.918 --> 13:17.713
We're going to jump off the
Tallest building in the world.

13:17.796 --> 13:19.006
All right!

13:19.089 --> 13:25.513
I like this guy's beard.

13:25.596 --> 13:29.391
Are we the first team here?

13:29.475 --> 13:30.059
Nice.

13:30.142 --> 13:31.018
Those are the instructors.

13:31.101 --> 13:32.101
Yes.

13:32.144 --> 13:33.896
Look at the guy with the beard.

13:33.979 --> 13:35.272
Let's go, let's go.

13:35.356 --> 13:35.940
Hello.

13:36.023 --> 13:38.400
Hi, hi.

13:38.484 --> 13:38.776
We're game.

13:38.859 --> 13:42.613
My god.

13:42.696 --> 13:43.531
Let's go.

13:43.614 --> 13:45.074
My god.

13:45.157 --> 13:49.078
This is our music.

13:49.161 --> 13:51.997
I'm nervous.

13:52.081 --> 13:53.081
This is insane.

13:53.123 --> 13:54.959
This is the glow park, right?

13:55.042 --> 14:03.042
This is good, man.

14:05.511 --> 14:06.804
Let's go.

14:06.887 --> 14:07.471
This way, bret.

14:07.555 --> 14:09.431
All right.

14:09.515 --> 14:13.394
This will be funny.

14:13.477 --> 14:15.437
Get dressed in the provided
Costumes.

14:15.521 --> 14:16.814
Will it fit me?

14:16.897 --> 14:21.110
I hope so.

14:21.193 --> 14:25.948
We need to stay with the
Other teams, remember.

14:26.031 --> 14:30.286
Colin and christie, by the time
They get there, they'll be done.

14:30.369 --> 14:31.745
We can win this.

14:31.829 --> 14:34.873
What is this, a dinosaur
Costume?

14:34.957 --> 14:36.226
I'm having major second
Thoughts.

14:36.250 --> 14:39.128
You don't think we should
Switch?

14:39.211 --> 14:39.878
Let's switch.

14:39.962 --> 14:41.630
You want to go to the other One?

14:41.714 --> 14:42.899
We're leaving, we're leaving.

14:42.923 --> 14:46.093
We need to go to the jump but
We need you to go fast.

14:46.176 --> 14:47.761
How fast?

14:47.845 --> 14:49.096
10 minutes.

14:49.179 --> 14:52.016
That's ok, elissa, by the
Time we get there, they've.

14:52.099 --> 14:53.851
Already jumped.

14:53.934 --> 14:54.768
It's one jump.

14:54.852 --> 14:56.520
This could be a game changer for
Us.

14:56.604 --> 14:56.979
Let's go.

14:57.062 --> 14:58.772
Glowing eggs.

14:58.856 --> 14:59.273
Yeah, glowing eggs.

14:59.356 --> 15:00.941
We're good to go.

15:01.025 --> 15:03.444
Let's go, let's go.

15:03.527 --> 15:04.653
I'm a dinosaur.

15:04.737 --> 15:06.322
Let's go this way, bret.

15:06.405 --> 15:08.365
Let's go.

15:08.449 --> 15:10.951
Look around, it could be
Anywhere.

15:11.035 --> 15:19.035
We had to put on a teran
Saurus rex outfit.

15:20.085 --> 15:25.132
We had to put on a teran
Saurus rex outfit.

15:25.215 --> 15:25.841
Godzilla in dubai.

15:25.924 --> 15:29.136
Look for eggs, look for eggs.

15:29.219 --> 15:31.472
I see eggs.

15:31.555 --> 15:31.889
Go get it.

15:31.972 --> 15:32.222
There it is.

15:32.306 --> 15:34.141
I got it!

15:34.224 --> 15:37.519
Grab it.

15:37.603 --> 15:39.688
I got it, I got it!

15:39.772 --> 15:40.606
Nuts.

15:40.689 --> 15:42.149
That was a huge park.

15:42.232 --> 15:42.733
A huge park.

15:42.816 --> 15:44.485
Why would they do that?

15:44.568 --> 15:47.029
Because they're rookies.

15:47.112 --> 15:48.197
That's ok.

15:48.280 --> 15:50.258
The jump will be super quick and
Then we can move on.

15:50.282 --> 15:53.911
My god.

15:53.994 --> 15:56.246
My... so beautiful.

15:56.330 --> 15:58.165
We're doing some virtual
Reality.

15:58.248 --> 15:59.333
No way.

15:59.416 --> 16:00.560
"Amazing race," you tricked
Us again.

16:00.584 --> 16:06.465
We thought we would either
Bungee jump or zipline or repel.

16:06.548 --> 16:09.718
But when we get there, it was
Not that at all.

16:09.802 --> 16:14.264
The detour was a virtual
Reality so I was like... burj.

16:14.348 --> 16:16.392
Khalifa, let's do it.

16:16.475 --> 16:18.894
Let's do it, baby.

16:18.977 --> 16:20.062
This is so cool.

16:20.145 --> 16:22.898
Attention, you have been
Chosen to complete an important.

16:22.981 --> 16:24.066
Classified mission.

16:24.149 --> 16:26.985
A satellite will shortly be
Passing over the burj khalifa.

16:27.069 --> 16:31.031
Your mission is to intercept the
Satellite using a transmitter,

16:31.115 --> 16:33.242
Get to the top as quickly as
Possible.

16:33.325 --> 16:33.826
Colin, check it out.

16:33.909 --> 16:35.911
This will be awesome.

16:35.994 --> 16:38.497
See the red lever, pull it Down.

16:38.580 --> 16:39.581
Good, well done.

16:39.665 --> 16:42.376
Quick, smash the glass and take
The transmitter.

16:42.459 --> 16:44.753
You need to get outside.

16:44.837 --> 16:46.255
Can you see the door?

16:46.338 --> 16:47.214
My god.

16:47.297 --> 16:47.881
Let's do it.

16:47.965 --> 16:50.092
What's your name?

16:50.175 --> 16:51.051
Zane.

16:51.135 --> 16:53.595
You're the best instructor,
Right?

16:53.679 --> 16:54.263
Climbing the burj khalifa.

16:54.346 --> 16:56.598
I feel like tom cruise.

16:56.682 --> 16:57.808
"Mission impossible."

16:57.891 --> 17:00.436
this is amazing.

17:00.519 --> 17:03.397
You are now 828 meters high.

17:03.480 --> 17:04.940
My god.

17:05.022 --> 17:06.775
The satellite is passing
Overhead.

17:06.858 --> 17:09.319
Pull the trigger to upload the
Code.

17:09.403 --> 17:10.779
Good, signal lock and uploading.

17:10.863 --> 17:11.195
You need to get out of here.

17:11.280 --> 17:12.906
Are you ready?

17:12.990 --> 17:13.990
Yes, I'm ready!

17:14.031 --> 17:19.246
Look below the jump.

17:19.329 --> 17:27.329
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

17:28.213 --> 17:31.341
I love dubai, yes.

17:31.425 --> 17:35.262
We were doing the virtual
Reality set and then you got a.

17:35.345 --> 17:36.263
Test at the end of it.

17:36.346 --> 17:38.307
Leo and I answered all five
Questions correct.

17:38.390 --> 17:40.976
No, another surprise.

17:41.059 --> 17:44.313
One question was about the
Height.

17:44.396 --> 17:47.191
What was the color of the lever.

17:47.274 --> 17:52.654
One was what was inside of the
Book.

17:52.738 --> 18:00.738
One was if you open the door in
And out and one was how many.

18:04.291 --> 18:04.666
Antenaes you had.

18:04.750 --> 18:05.667
Let's do it.

18:05.751 --> 18:07.211
My god.

18:07.294 --> 18:10.339
Relax and enjoy the view.

18:10.422 --> 18:11.548
That was amazing.

18:11.632 --> 18:12.841
That was awesome.

18:12.925 --> 18:14.676
Sorry, guys, you did not Pass.

18:14.760 --> 18:17.679
You have to do one more attempt.

18:17.763 --> 18:18.764
Please come with me.

18:18.847 --> 18:19.348
Hey, boys.

18:19.431 --> 18:19.807
Hello.

18:19.890 --> 18:21.183
Let's do it.

18:21.266 --> 18:23.310
How many antennas.

18:23.393 --> 18:24.186
I put four.

18:24.269 --> 18:24.978
I put three.

18:25.062 --> 18:26.062
I think it was four.

18:26.105 --> 18:27.856
You're wrong, leo.

18:27.940 --> 18:30.359
Some of your answers were
Wrong so you have to stay in the.

18:30.442 --> 18:31.819
Back of the line.

18:31.902 --> 18:32.486
Let's go.

18:32.569 --> 18:32.903
Going up.

18:32.986 --> 18:34.404
I'm climbing.

18:34.488 --> 18:36.323
How many antennas did you Put?

18:36.406 --> 18:37.491
Two.

18:37.574 --> 18:38.200
Four.

18:38.283 --> 18:39.868
Yeah.

18:39.952 --> 18:42.538
820 meters high.

18:42.621 --> 18:43.372
I'm terrified.

18:43.455 --> 18:45.582
One over here, wait, come Here.

18:45.666 --> 18:49.711
You got it, brit.

18:49.795 --> 18:50.379
You're doing so good.

18:50.462 --> 18:51.129
Just get two more.

18:51.213 --> 18:53.549
There's five different Colors.

18:53.632 --> 18:57.344
One green.

18:57.427 --> 18:58.720
I got the white one over here.

18:58.804 --> 19:00.556
There's one right there!

19:00.639 --> 19:02.015
Ok.

19:02.099 --> 19:04.393
We got white.

19:04.476 --> 19:06.395
Nicole.

19:06.478 --> 19:09.064
Good job, nicole.

19:09.147 --> 19:10.190
Where do you see the blue?

19:10.274 --> 19:10.732
Blue, over here.

19:10.816 --> 19:14.111
I got it, I got it.

19:14.194 --> 19:14.570
There's the green.

19:14.653 --> 19:16.864
I see the green.

19:16.947 --> 19:17.573
Grab this one.

19:17.656 --> 19:21.785
Ok, ok, yeah.

19:21.869 --> 19:22.870
Purple.

19:22.953 --> 19:23.370
Brit, brit.

19:23.453 --> 19:25.414
I'm coming.

19:25.497 --> 19:26.290
Come on, grab this.

19:26.373 --> 19:27.541
We're in a race!

19:27.624 --> 19:32.754
I've had three babies in five
Years so I'm not some kind of.

19:32.838 --> 19:35.924
Seasoned olympic runner by any
Stretch of the imagination.

19:36.008 --> 19:39.303
Let's go to the start and
Drop our eggs but we need to.

19:39.386 --> 19:39.845
Run.

19:39.928 --> 19:40.304
She's doing great.

19:40.387 --> 19:41.430
You can do it.

19:41.513 --> 19:43.432
Let's go.

19:43.515 --> 19:44.433
Bret, this way.

19:44.516 --> 19:46.393
Where are you going?

19:46.476 --> 19:47.269
In circles?

19:47.352 --> 19:48.371
You got to get up here and
Follow me.

19:48.395 --> 19:49.271
Come on, bret!

19:49.354 --> 19:51.732
We're going to get there.

19:51.815 --> 19:55.068
In that annoying oklahoma
Accent.

19:55.152 --> 19:56.445
I'm like, shut up.

19:56.528 --> 19:59.406
Let's go!

19:59.489 --> 20:03.994
Who is the best jump master?

20:04.077 --> 20:04.578
Ok, ok.

20:04.661 --> 20:11.126
We got to hurry!

20:11.209 --> 20:12.127
Looking around.

20:12.211 --> 20:14.713
Ok.

20:14.796 --> 20:17.132
Are we bungee jumping?

20:17.215 --> 20:21.428
You can't tell us?

20:21.511 --> 20:24.473
I'm sorry, guys, you failed.

20:24.556 --> 20:29.519
This round.

20:29.603 --> 20:31.813
Hold it up to the satellite.

20:31.897 --> 20:35.317
It was how tall did it say it
Was, what color was the lever.

20:35.400 --> 20:41.156
What was in the broken thing to
Get the transmitter, if the door.

20:41.240 --> 20:44.368
Opened in and out and how many
Antenna were on the transmitter.

20:44.451 --> 20:46.203
I said three.

20:46.286 --> 20:47.704
Here you go.

20:47.788 --> 20:49.915
Here they are.

20:49.998 --> 20:51.166
Are we bungee jumping?

20:51.250 --> 20:52.668
No, end of the line.

20:52.751 --> 20:56.672
I know, but is that what
We're doing?

20:56.755 --> 20:58.090
You did not pass.

20:58.173 --> 20:59.299
You have to do one more.

20:59.383 --> 21:00.384
What?

21:00.467 --> 21:00.801
Three.

21:00.884 --> 21:03.178
I saw one.

21:03.261 --> 21:09.017
Smash the glass and take the
Transmitter.

21:09.101 --> 21:10.686
I see an egg on your left.

21:10.769 --> 21:14.356
Blue egg, blue egg!

21:14.439 --> 21:18.610
Let's find our nest and come
Down and get two eggs.

21:18.694 --> 21:21.863
We need two more colors.

21:21.947 --> 21:23.365
Where's the nest?

21:23.448 --> 21:23.865
Do you know?

21:23.949 --> 21:24.866
The other side.

21:24.950 --> 21:26.201
What other side?

21:26.284 --> 21:27.202
Across the exit.

21:27.285 --> 21:27.661
Thank you.

21:27.744 --> 21:29.871
Straight ahead!

21:29.955 --> 21:32.374
This is the nest, this is the
Nest!

21:32.457 --> 21:33.375
Two more.

21:33.458 --> 21:35.669
There's the nest.

21:35.752 --> 21:36.503
Yeah, let's go, come on!

21:36.586 --> 21:40.716
One more eggy.

21:40.799 --> 21:42.718
Whatever it is, we need the
Other one.

21:42.801 --> 21:44.344
Let's go, come on!

21:44.428 --> 21:44.886
No, that's not it.

21:44.970 --> 21:46.096
They said it was here.

21:46.179 --> 21:47.764
Yes, it is!

21:47.848 --> 21:48.390
It is?

21:48.473 --> 21:49.513
The thing's on my face.

21:54.146 --> 21:54.896
This is it?

21:54.980 --> 21:55.564
Yes!

21:55.647 --> 21:57.899
Put them in.

21:57.983 --> 21:58.734
Let's go get another egg.

21:58.817 --> 21:59.526
We got it, we're done.

21:59.609 --> 22:00.652
We got it.

22:00.736 --> 22:05.407
Take your taxi to soho garden
To find your next clue.

22:05.490 --> 22:06.241
Hustle back.

22:06.324 --> 22:06.742
We're done.

22:06.825 --> 22:09.369
Come on!

22:09.453 --> 22:10.638
Smash the glass and take the
Transmitter.

22:10.662 --> 22:12.497
We did it twice.

22:12.581 --> 22:14.916
We messed up the antenna.

22:15.000 --> 22:17.919
What makes you think this is
One satellite, one satellite.

22:18.003 --> 22:20.922
You think each one of those are
Antenna?

22:21.006 --> 22:23.300
I saw one antenna.

22:23.383 --> 22:23.884
We have to be on the same page.

22:23.967 --> 22:25.594
Let's do three first.

22:25.677 --> 22:29.931
Good job, guys, you passed
The test.

22:30.015 --> 22:33.894
Paying attention to your
Surroundings, like living life,

22:33.977 --> 22:34.770
Very similar.

22:34.853 --> 22:36.980
Ok, guys, all your answers are
Correct.

22:37.064 --> 22:37.439
Follow me.

22:37.522 --> 22:40.567
Let's go.

22:40.650 --> 22:43.820
The red lever in front of the
Window.

22:43.904 --> 22:46.782
Smash the glass and take the
Transmitter.

22:46.865 --> 22:49.826
Place the suction cup on the
Window.

22:49.910 --> 22:52.788
That's awesome.

22:52.871 --> 22:54.915
I'm ready, let's jump.

22:54.998 --> 22:59.961
This is so scary!

23:00.045 --> 23:01.671
What is this?

23:01.755 --> 23:03.924
We had to complete, take a Test.

23:04.007 --> 23:06.527
The only thing I knew is that
The door opened outward and that.

23:06.551 --> 23:08.345
The handle was red.

23:08.428 --> 23:11.973
It was harder than the d.M.V.

23:12.057 --> 23:12.516
Test, for sure.

23:12.599 --> 23:14.309
Sorry, did not pass.

23:14.392 --> 23:14.810
Please do it again.

23:14.893 --> 23:16.520
You did not pass.

23:16.603 --> 23:18.855
You went with three?

23:18.939 --> 23:21.733
It has to be one, buddy.

23:21.817 --> 23:23.819
I got it.

23:23.902 --> 23:24.653
Floyd, this way!

23:24.736 --> 23:26.780
Floyd, this way!

23:26.863 --> 23:27.656
Wait, is this it?

23:27.739 --> 23:28.907
We need this.

23:28.990 --> 23:30.867
Ok.

23:30.951 --> 23:31.785
I found it!

23:31.868 --> 23:33.370
I found it!

23:33.453 --> 23:35.330
Come on, brit.

23:35.413 --> 23:37.457
Let's freaking go, come on.

23:37.541 --> 23:43.839
This way!

23:43.922 --> 23:51.388
Thank you, thank you, thank.

23:51.471 --> 23:51.930
You.

23:52.013 --> 23:54.641
Can we get a check?

23:54.724 --> 23:55.892
I got five eggs.

23:55.976 --> 23:57.018
We need a check!

23:57.102 --> 24:01.481
We're standing next to our eggs,
Like "We need a check."

24:01.565 --> 24:02.565
we got it.

24:02.607 --> 24:06.403
Are you freaking morons, dumb
Dinosaur.

24:06.486 --> 24:07.696
Nicole!

24:07.779 --> 24:11.491
Where's the nest?

24:11.575 --> 24:14.494
We've got it right here and it
Looks like a nest.

24:14.578 --> 24:15.078
Soho garden.

24:15.162 --> 24:16.538
Right here, right here!

24:16.621 --> 24:16.955
Done.

24:17.038 --> 24:17.497
Thank you.

24:17.581 --> 24:24.671
Britney, let's go.

24:24.754 --> 24:27.048
I see the clue box right Here.

24:27.132 --> 24:28.216
Let's go.

24:28.300 --> 24:29.509
Road block.

24:29.593 --> 24:31.303
Who can feel the beat.

24:31.386 --> 24:35.682
No.

24:35.765 --> 24:38.226
This is the perfect
Solution for avoiding any noise.

24:38.310 --> 24:40.562
Complaints from a nightclub.

24:40.645 --> 24:45.734
It's silent rave night here at
Soho garden in dubai where.

24:45.817 --> 24:50.739
Everyone is wearing headphones
And listening to different dance.

24:50.822 --> 24:55.035
Mixes but somewhere in the crowd
There are a few party goers.

24:55.118 --> 24:56.119
Following the d.J.

24:56.203 --> 24:59.414
If teams can find someone
Dancing to the d.J.'s beat,

24:59.497 --> 25:00.850
Relying only on powers of
Observation, they'll get the.

25:00.874 --> 25:01.750
Next clue.

25:01.833 --> 25:05.253
You're doing it, this is the
Road block.

25:05.337 --> 25:06.922
I'm not a dancers.

25:07.005 --> 25:08.048
This is not good.

25:08.131 --> 25:09.131
He has no rhythm.

25:09.174 --> 25:11.760
My god.

25:11.843 --> 25:12.761
What is going on here?

25:12.844 --> 25:14.804
I don't hear anything.

25:14.888 --> 25:16.765
It's the most bizarre thing in
The world to me.

25:16.848 --> 25:17.390
Where's the d.J.?

25:17.474 --> 25:19.476
You recognize the track?

25:19.559 --> 25:23.647
Yeah, yeah.

25:23.730 --> 25:27.609
I got to listen to this music
And try to figure out who's.

25:27.692 --> 25:29.778
Dancing to it.

25:29.861 --> 25:33.782
Everyone's listening to
Different music.

25:33.865 --> 25:39.537
Just grab one, just do
Something.

25:39.621 --> 25:44.793
Just standing there like an
Idiot.

25:44.876 --> 25:52.876
One time, bret, get lucky.

25:57.222 --> 25:58.640
I am feeling it.

25:58.723 --> 26:02.102
I'm feeling it.

26:02.185 --> 26:05.021
It's clearly the antenna.

26:05.105 --> 26:09.818
He said three.

26:09.901 --> 26:10.360
He said one.

26:10.443 --> 26:12.946
Don't worry about me.

26:13.029 --> 26:15.323
828 meters.

26:15.407 --> 26:19.119
Pay attention.

26:19.202 --> 26:19.828
Come on, leo.

26:19.911 --> 26:22.872
I told you it was one.

26:22.956 --> 26:25.959
This is the correct answer, I
Had it two times ago.

26:26.042 --> 26:28.837
Here you go.

26:28.920 --> 26:33.675
Tell you guys, you did not
Pass but you cannot do it again.

26:33.758 --> 26:34.509
What the hell?

26:34.592 --> 26:38.680
We're going to get it this Time.

26:38.763 --> 26:41.683
Making mistakes that we
Shouldn't could be the.

26:41.766 --> 26:44.519
Difference between being in the
Race and being eliminated.

26:44.602 --> 26:46.080
From first to worst is not a
Good feeling.

26:46.104 --> 26:48.148
This is taking us too long.

26:48.231 --> 26:49.311
I don't know what to do.

26:54.404 --> 26:57.073
Why is it so hard?

26:57.157 --> 27:01.703
It's the signal interceptor,
The thing you hold, with four.

27:01.786 --> 27:02.871
Antennas on it.

27:02.954 --> 27:04.932
We didn't pay attention to
The details, the last question.

27:04.956 --> 27:12.956
Was how many antennae was on the
Signal interceptor.

27:13.423 --> 27:14.716
Sorry, did not pass.

27:14.799 --> 27:15.818
Elissa, pay attention to
Everything.

27:15.842 --> 27:17.302
I know I did.

27:17.385 --> 27:18.762
I know I got it right.

27:18.845 --> 27:23.391
I thought I did, too.

27:23.475 --> 27:25.018
It's ok, just pay attention.

27:25.101 --> 27:25.810
Ok.

27:25.894 --> 27:30.357
Come on, bret.

27:30.440 --> 27:32.734
Club scenes and bret, I'm not
Sure they go together.

27:32.817 --> 27:37.530
Find a dancer dancing to the
Song being played by the d.J. At.

27:37.614 --> 27:38.156
A silent rave.

27:38.239 --> 27:39.074
You want to do this one?

27:39.157 --> 27:39.741
Sure.

27:39.824 --> 27:43.912
Maybe he gets lucky here.

27:43.995 --> 27:46.081
No.

27:46.164 --> 27:48.291
I got really frustrated with
Bret.

27:48.375 --> 27:51.628
He was picking people he thinks
Is cute.

27:51.711 --> 27:52.337
He's picking cute guys.

27:52.420 --> 27:54.089
My god, what is he doing?

27:54.172 --> 27:54.714
Whatever.

27:54.798 --> 27:56.633
Who can feel the beat?

27:56.716 --> 28:01.304
Find a dancer dancing to the
Song played by the d.J. At a.

28:01.388 --> 28:02.555
Silent rave... cool!

28:02.639 --> 28:02.806
You got to do it.

28:02.889 --> 28:10.889
Ok.

28:20.657 --> 28:22.784
This is how we party at the
V.I.P. Section.

28:22.867 --> 28:27.789
V.I.P., baby, v.I.P.

28:27.872 --> 28:31.793
find a dancer that is dancing
To the song being played by the.

28:31.876 --> 28:33.628
D.J. At a silent rave.

28:33.711 --> 28:34.629
Love it.

28:34.712 --> 28:36.798
You love it?

28:36.881 --> 28:39.426
You want to do it?

28:39.509 --> 28:40.869
You feel more comfortable doing
It?

28:40.927 --> 28:42.470
Then you do it.

28:42.554 --> 28:43.179
I can do it.

28:43.263 --> 28:45.807
You do it.

28:45.890 --> 28:50.437
Come on, nic, let's go!

28:50.520 --> 28:51.813
Christie's doing awesome.

28:51.896 --> 28:52.939
Let's go, let's go.

28:53.022 --> 28:55.692
You got it.

28:55.775 --> 29:03.775
You got it, come on, baby!

29:04.033 --> 29:05.160
Really?

29:05.243 --> 29:09.497
No dice.

29:09.581 --> 29:13.668
We got this, man.

29:13.751 --> 29:17.005
I'm happy to tell you guys
That you have finally passed.

29:17.088 --> 29:17.839
Thank you.

29:17.922 --> 29:18.840
Please come with me.

29:18.923 --> 29:21.050
I knew it.

29:21.134 --> 29:23.970
Why didn't you trust me, man?

29:24.053 --> 29:32.053
Not too smart here.

29:33.271 --> 29:35.482
I'm happy to say you passed.

29:35.565 --> 29:38.151
Beautiful, beautiful.

29:38.234 --> 29:38.985
Beautiful, beautiful.

29:39.068 --> 29:43.072
Omar, we have to go to soho
Garden.

29:43.156 --> 29:44.991
Gosh, I wish I were doing This.

29:45.074 --> 29:50.163
I love a silent disco.

29:50.246 --> 29:52.874
I was a drum major in college
For three years and my job was.

29:52.957 --> 29:57.295
To keep the rhythm for the band
So I know how to feel a rhythm.

29:57.378 --> 30:05.378
Myself and recognize my rhythm
In other people.

30:07.430 --> 30:14.062
Myself and recognize my rhythm
In other people.

30:14.145 --> 30:16.940
Yes!

30:17.023 --> 30:20.109
Yes!

30:20.193 --> 30:25.782
Ride the world's largest
Zipline.

30:25.865 --> 30:28.910
This is the world's
Largest man-made marina and now.

30:28.993 --> 30:34.749
The pit stop for teams in dubai
Who will be flying in, superman.

30:34.832 --> 30:35.832
Style.

30:35.875 --> 30:37.311
The last team to touch down here
May be eliminated.

30:37.335 --> 30:39.170
Let's get out of here.

30:39.254 --> 30:47.254
Zipline, baby.

30:48.805 --> 30:50.056
Listen to the music.

30:50.139 --> 30:53.351
Grab somebody.

30:53.434 --> 30:55.395
Yes!

30:55.478 --> 30:57.939
Yes, yes, yes, yes!

30:58.022 --> 31:02.235
Excuse me, excuse me, excuse Me.

31:02.318 --> 31:03.403
You got it.

31:03.486 --> 31:08.783
I was wiggling through the
Crowd trying to find anybody.

31:08.866 --> 31:11.136
Feeling my beat because I was
Dancing to it and I would make.

31:11.160 --> 31:13.264
Eye contact with them and I was
Like, are you feeling what I'm.

31:13.288 --> 31:16.040
Feeling?

31:25.508 --> 31:26.801
Thank you.

31:26.884 --> 31:28.845
Come on, buddy.

31:28.928 --> 31:30.179
What's bret doing now?

31:30.263 --> 31:31.180
Bret's got another one.

31:31.264 --> 31:36.269
Maybe he gets lucky here.

31:36.352 --> 31:37.812
I don't know, buddy.

31:37.895 --> 31:38.895
I'm not good at this.

31:38.938 --> 31:40.356
Yes!

31:40.440 --> 31:40.898
Yes!

31:40.982 --> 31:42.775
That was nightmare.

31:42.859 --> 31:44.527
I didn't think I'd ever get it.

31:44.611 --> 31:47.171
Christie's finding the rhythm
In the crowd, honing in on who's.

31:47.238 --> 31:52.952
Jumping to the beat.

31:53.036 --> 31:54.036
Let's see if she did it.

31:54.078 --> 31:55.163
Yes.

31:55.246 --> 31:56.664
She got it!

31:56.748 --> 31:58.791
She killed it!

31:58.875 --> 32:00.501
Go, janelle!

32:00.585 --> 32:05.381
If she can get this really
Fast, this would be so.

32:05.465 --> 32:06.841
Incredible.

32:06.924 --> 32:08.092
You got to be kidding me.

32:08.176 --> 32:10.011
Dubai, dubai.

32:10.094 --> 32:15.099
Please treat us right because
Rachel and elissa are right on.

32:15.183 --> 32:15.975
Our tails.

32:16.059 --> 32:18.519
We don't know what place
They're in.

32:18.603 --> 32:21.939
We don't know if the five eggs
Are easy to find or if they ran.

32:22.023 --> 32:24.150
Around for another hour.

32:24.233 --> 32:25.860
You!

32:25.943 --> 32:27.320
I want you!

32:27.403 --> 32:28.029
My gosh.

32:28.112 --> 32:29.030
I don't know.

Go janelle!

32:39.248 --> 32:41.042
Got it!

32:41.125 --> 32:44.337

32:44.420 --> 32:48.758
The world's largest urban
Zipline is what we're about to.

32:48.841 --> 32:50.343
Do.

32:50.426 --> 32:55.723
Watch tower 4, walk up the
Stairs to the roof, your arrival.

32:55.807 --> 33:01.062
To the roof is the order to the
Pit stop so there's a chance.

33:01.145 --> 33:04.691
There's a team literally right
Behind us.

33:04.774 --> 33:07.360
Another team could be very close
Behind.

33:07.443 --> 33:10.905
That could be becca and floyd
Right there.

33:10.988 --> 33:12.657
Are they behind us?

33:12.740 --> 33:14.575
Is it this way, buddy?

33:14.659 --> 33:17.245
Typically looking.

33:17.328 --> 33:24.335
We're seconds behind nicole
And vic and team fun.

33:24.419 --> 33:25.586
My god.

33:25.670 --> 33:31.259
So far the only teams that
Have come in first are "Amazing."

33:31.342 --> 33:32.385
"Race" teams.

33:32.468 --> 33:33.094
It's frustrating that
"Amazing race" team is up there.

33:33.177 --> 33:37.056
Every time but we're right
There.

33:37.140 --> 33:39.267
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

33:39.350 --> 33:40.893
We can do this.

33:48.067 --> 33:50.111
We're out first.

33:52.071 --> 33:53.215
That's them dropping off There.

33:53.239 --> 33:53.948
Thank you.

33:54.031 --> 33:56.576
Come on, bret, we can beat Them.

33:56.659 --> 33:59.829
We love you!

33:59.912 --> 34:04.292
Elevator, this way.

34:04.375 --> 34:08.295
I think that's the two.

34:08.379 --> 34:10.590
That's the two.

34:10.672 --> 34:12.341
Do you think this is it?

34:12.425 --> 34:15.261
I love you but we are getting
In first.

34:15.344 --> 34:18.306
Bret, run for it.

34:18.389 --> 34:24.937
Man this is tight.

34:25.021 --> 34:26.522
Road block.

34:26.606 --> 34:34.606
Who can feel the beat.

34:35.782 --> 34:43.782
This is the one.

34:45.708 --> 34:46.375
Yeah!

34:46.458 --> 34:50.670
Let's get out of here.

34:50.755 --> 34:52.297
Leo and jamal.

34:52.380 --> 34:54.801
My god, we're last place.

34:54.884 --> 34:56.844
Road block.

34:56.928 --> 34:58.304
I'll do it.

34:58.387 --> 35:04.852
Rachel hopefully will get us
Caught up.

35:04.936 --> 35:05.812
She's awesome.

35:05.895 --> 35:07.271
Go rach.

35:07.355 --> 35:09.690
Rachel does everything good.

35:09.774 --> 35:15.404
Excuse me.

35:15.488 --> 35:17.198
Go rach.

35:17.281 --> 35:18.366
You can catch up.

35:18.449 --> 35:20.535
Yes!

35:20.618 --> 35:25.832
We're in last place.

35:25.915 --> 35:29.377
Come on, rach.

35:29.460 --> 35:30.211
Keep it together.

35:30.294 --> 35:31.462
We're not out.

35:31.546 --> 35:37.426
I love "The amazing race" and
I've had so much fun doing it.

35:37.510 --> 35:41.430
Twice and I came back with my
Sister the third time thinking.

35:41.514 --> 35:43.766
That we could really do a good
Job.

35:43.850 --> 35:46.185
We are doing a good job.

35:46.269 --> 35:48.980
I got to travel around the
World twice with my husband.

35:49.063 --> 35:52.275
Rach, we saw leo and jamal
There.

35:52.358 --> 35:54.986
Our cab driver could get us
There quicker.

35:55.069 --> 35:57.613
Can you go faster?

35:57.697 --> 36:00.366
My god.

36:00.449 --> 36:06.080
About to do the world's
Longest zipline.

36:06.163 --> 36:10.042
Lord jesus, you've got me in.

36:10.126 --> 36:10.626
Your hands.

36:10.710 --> 36:14.255
Help me fly over dubai.

36:14.338 --> 36:19.218
I don't even think I've
Processed what's about to.

36:19.302 --> 36:19.594
Happen.

36:19.677 --> 36:20.428
My god.

36:20.511 --> 36:24.473
My god!

36:24.557 --> 36:32.557
My god!

36:34.692 --> 36:42.692
I'm coming through!

36:43.534 --> 36:49.540
It was amazing!

36:49.624 --> 36:53.002
Welcome to dubai marina.

36:53.085 --> 37:00.426
Welcome to united arab emirates.

37:00.509 --> 37:06.849
This is team fun and they are
Team number one.

37:06.933 --> 37:09.310
What's one thing we all love?

37:09.393 --> 37:09.644
Money.

37:09.727 --> 37:12.772
Yes.

37:12.855 --> 37:13.564
$5,000 each.

37:13.648 --> 37:14.875
And the fun meter right now is
Where?

37:14.899 --> 37:20.655
This is your opportunity to
Earn your very own phil-o-meter.

37:20.738 --> 37:24.617
And all you got to do is join us
In the freestyle circle.

37:24.700 --> 37:31.290
Five, six, seven, eight.

37:32.625 --> 37:37.505
The team number one, they
Are team fun, arrived in dubai.

37:37.588 --> 37:39.507
With $5,000 what they gonna do.

37:39.590 --> 37:43.386
We just flew through the city
Of dubai.

37:43.469 --> 37:51.469
We won some cash and we're in
First place, team fun has proven.

37:52.311 --> 37:54.355
They deserve to be in "Amazing
Race."

37:54.438 --> 37:57.358
Chris and bret, smiling,
Right at the top.

37:57.441 --> 38:01.028
We're not messing around
Anymore, phil.

38:01.112 --> 38:03.572
We're here to go to the end
And win $1 million.

38:03.656 --> 38:07.451
Right now we have to make our
Way to the pit stop and last.

38:07.535 --> 38:11.872
Team may be eliminated and I
Think between us and rachel and.

38:11.956 --> 38:13.040
Elissa.

38:13.124 --> 38:16.669
Just for me, "The amazing
Race," it is good and fun it.

38:16.752 --> 38:20.881
Maybe it took me two more
Seasons to enjoy, really, like,

38:20.965 --> 38:25.594
Not focus on just...
rach, please stop.

38:25.678 --> 38:30.891
The anticipation...

38:30.975 --> 38:37.106
I I love you!

38:37.189 --> 38:38.941
All right, all right, all Right!

38:39.025 --> 38:39.775
That was incredible!

38:39.859 --> 38:42.111
That was awesome.

38:42.194 --> 38:43.738
15 years later.

38:43.821 --> 38:45.674
I think it's going to be
Interesting for people to see.

38:45.698 --> 38:46.782
How you've evolved.

38:46.866 --> 38:51.412
I think we're appreciating
Ourselves differently, we're.

38:51.495 --> 38:52.848
Appreciating each other
Differently.

38:52.872 --> 38:56.917
You can only think about getting
Ahead, go, go, go, or go just as.

38:57.001 --> 39:00.129
Fast and suck the juice out of
Every experience.

39:00.212 --> 39:08.212
That's what we're doing.

39:13.684 --> 39:15.603
My god!

39:15.686 --> 39:19.732
I'm a bird, I'm a plane, I'm on
"The amazing race!"

39:19.815 --> 39:22.777
We have new teams featured
Near the top of the ranks now.

39:22.860 --> 39:25.112
It's anybody's game, it
Really is.

39:25.196 --> 39:32.828
You can't count anybody out.

39:32.912 --> 39:33.370
Hair's out today.

39:33.454 --> 39:34.580
Hair is out, phil.

39:34.663 --> 39:36.624
You let your hair down in Dubai.

39:36.707 --> 39:39.627
It's very luscious.

39:39.710 --> 39:41.796
I have been growing it out for a
Little bit.

39:41.879 --> 39:42.630
You can do hair Commercials.

39:42.713 --> 39:43.130
Maybe.

39:43.214 --> 39:45.591
Please go fast.

39:45.674 --> 39:46.592
We're the last team.

39:46.675 --> 39:48.427
We don't want to get eliminated.

39:48.511 --> 39:49.136
There's one behind us.

39:49.220 --> 39:50.137
Thank you, buddy.

39:50.221 --> 39:51.639
It touches your heart.

39:51.722 --> 39:58.104
Rach, seriously.

39:58.187 --> 40:04.985
I hope they're behind us.

40:05.069 --> 40:08.781
Janelle and britney, I am
Pleased to tell you, you are.

40:08.864 --> 40:10.032
Team number six.

40:10.116 --> 40:10.533
Still in it.

40:10.616 --> 40:12.660
Still in it.

40:12.743 --> 40:14.161
Who's this?

40:14.245 --> 40:22.245
I love dubai!

40:23.712 --> 40:25.965
What's going on with you.

40:26.048 --> 40:26.674
Guys?

40:26.757 --> 40:27.877
Came out of the gate strong.

40:27.925 --> 40:31.637
We are cutting it close
Because there's less and less.

40:31.720 --> 40:32.179
Teams.

40:32.263 --> 40:32.721
Playing with fire.

40:32.805 --> 40:37.226
But don't cut us out!

40:37.309 --> 40:38.435
We're gonna do it.

40:38.519 --> 40:41.689
My little daughter is 2 years
Old and she's going to be so.

40:41.772 --> 40:42.606
Proud of her mom.

40:42.690 --> 40:45.651
We were doing so good and
Gave it our all.

40:45.734 --> 40:48.904
Three, two, one, go!

40:48.988 --> 40:56.988
I've made it through seasons.

40:57.121 --> 41:00.541
I thought I would kiss butt.

41:00.624 --> 41:01.500
It's so disappointing.

41:01.584 --> 41:07.173
A little mistake can cost you
The entire race.

41:07.256 --> 41:10.217
It's so fun to travel with my
Sister and get these memories.

41:10.301 --> 41:12.386
We'll never, ever be able to
Make again.

41:12.469 --> 41:15.431
That was so fun.

41:15.514 --> 41:16.432
Still smiling.

41:16.515 --> 41:18.934
I'm on "The amazing race,"
You got to smile.

41:19.018 --> 41:20.436
Not your day.

41:20.519 --> 41:21.854
You guys have been racing so
Well.

41:21.937 --> 41:27.026
Sometimes you have to take
Risks and I want to teach my.

41:27.109 --> 41:31.530
Daughter to take risks in life
And I want to raise her up to be.

41:31.614 --> 41:38.913
A strong female and be brave and
So we took the risk and went to.

41:38.996 --> 41:40.122
The jump.

41:40.206 --> 41:42.642
We thought it would be really
Quick and we could catch up with.

41:42.666 --> 41:43.334
The other teams.

41:43.417 --> 41:44.737
We couldn't make up the lost
Time.

41:44.793 --> 41:48.547
We gave it our all.

41:48.631 --> 41:53.052
I wanted to always do the race
And to do it with my sister,

41:53.135 --> 41:58.766
It's like, you know...
we can never forget.

41:58.849 --> 42:00.976
Rachel, this is a
Nonelimination leg.

42:01.060 --> 42:02.603
You're still in this race.

42:02.686 --> 42:07.733
Are you kidding!

42:07.816 --> 42:11.779
I'm serious.

42:11.862 --> 42:14.281
We cannot mess up again.

42:14.365 --> 42:17.117
Sometimes you get knocked down,
You have to pick yourself back.

42:17.201 --> 42:21.455
Up and 100% I'm making it to leg
12 again.

42:21.538 --> 42:22.456
I have no doubt in my mind.

42:22.539 --> 42:25.584
I came here to win.

42:32.925 --> 42:34.069

National captioning institute,

42:34.093 --> 42:37.054

Next.

In our first ever trip to
Uganda.

42:52.152 --> 42:53.153
Hello, chicken.

42:53.237 --> 42:57.950
In a massive market,
Janelle takes the low way.

42:58.033 --> 42:59.159
No, I'm lost.

42:59.243 --> 43:03.163
While colin and christie
Face a long hole and the.

43:03.247 --> 43:05.666
Head-to-head returns.

43:05.749 --> 43:07.793
That sucks.
