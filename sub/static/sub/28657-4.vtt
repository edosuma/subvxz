00:06.160 --> 00:08.160
So, what do we do now?

00:20.360 --> 00:22.119
If biscuits are a rare event here,

00:22.120 --> 00:24.639
then cake is absolutely unheard of!

00:24.640 --> 00:28.277
This is a real celebration,
Mr Petrukhin!

00:35.360 --> 00:39.724
Come, Mr Samuel.
Let's get the signing under way!

00:42.200 --> 00:44.199
I can't agree to this yet.

00:44.200 --> 00:46.382
What? What's the matter?

00:47.600 --> 00:50.399
I want to take these documents away
and have a further look at them.

00:50.400 --> 00:53.879
But we've seen them already!
And the lawyers have looked at them.

00:53.880 --> 00:56.519
Why am I not dealing directly
with the authorities?

00:56.520 --> 00:58.119
The RAF?

00:58.120 --> 01:00.919
The Secret Service gives you a clean
bill of health, Mr Petrukhin.

01:00.920 --> 01:02.719
That's how it works.

01:02.720 --> 01:04.599
I would like to see
the head of your department

01:04.599 --> 01:06.679
as soon as possible, please.

01:06.680 --> 01:08.239
Why?

01:08.240 --> 01:11.599
Because I think that is
the correct thing to do.

01:11.600 --> 01:14.782
Now... I will leave you, gentlemen.

01:20.200 --> 01:23.110
Go back. I have nothing for you.

01:23.320 --> 01:25.240
Go back!

01:27.800 --> 01:29.480
Go on!

01:38.480 --> 01:40.120
Go! Shoo!

01:48.560 --> 01:52.288
Do you want to get out
of this place, too?

01:52.760 --> 01:55.559
- Mr Petrukhin, hold on a moment.
- What is it?

01:55.560 --> 01:59.039
I just wanted to say I'll arrange
for you to meet Dick Armstrong.

01:59.040 --> 02:00.799
He's the head of the department.

02:00.800 --> 02:02.519
He's seen you before, actually,

02:02.520 --> 02:05.079
fitting hearing aids
to the members of his club.

02:05.080 --> 02:06.280
OK?

02:08.840 --> 02:12.931
Come on, Guy. The gentleman
wants to get away.

02:27.600 --> 02:29.679
Yes?

02:29.680 --> 02:31.399
This is No. 14?

02:31.400 --> 02:33.599
Yes.

02:33.600 --> 02:35.559
Yes?

02:35.560 --> 02:37.879
You don't have an Anthony Shaw
staying here?

02:37.880 --> 02:40.719
No - this is not a boarding house
any more, madam,

02:40.720 --> 02:43.759
nobody's staying here.

02:43.760 --> 02:46.319
I couldn't come in, could I?

02:46.320 --> 02:49.411
No, we run a little business here.

02:50.040 --> 02:54.439
We type up manuscripts,
as you can see.

02:54.440 --> 02:57.479
We type everything, from legal
documents to people's novels.

02:57.480 --> 02:59.639
Not many of those get published,
though.

02:59.640 --> 03:02.559
- And upstairs?
- More of the same.

03:02.560 --> 03:04.359
Madam?

03:04.360 --> 03:06.520
Madam!

03:09.240 --> 03:11.319
Are you satisfied now, madam?

03:11.320 --> 03:13.559
There's nobody staying here,
I told you.

03:13.560 --> 03:16.479
Do you have forwarding addresses for
the people that were living here?

03:16.480 --> 03:18.119
We do not, madam, no.

03:18.120 --> 03:20.359
When did it stop being a boarding
house? Three years ago.

03:20.360 --> 03:22.439
Mr Burridge sold it to us.
Now, if you could please...

03:22.440 --> 03:24.719
Then how can I find him?
I must to speak to him urgently.

03:24.720 --> 03:27.639
He moved to South Africa.
I don't have an address.

03:27.640 --> 03:29.439
Have you ever seen this young man?

03:29.440 --> 03:32.479
- I haven't, madam, no.
- Please, look carefully.

03:32.480 --> 03:34.159
I have not, no.

03:34.160 --> 03:37.342
Have any of you ever seen this man?

03:39.400 --> 03:43.039
These manuscripts... did he ever
bring anything in to be typed?

03:43.040 --> 03:45.039
Please, try to remember.

03:45.040 --> 03:46.639
See, he's my son,

03:46.640 --> 03:48.959
and I'm sorry to come charging in
here to your office,

03:48.960 --> 03:51.519
but he's my son, you see,
and he's missing.

03:51.520 --> 03:54.884
As I said,
I've never seen him before.

04:05.960 --> 04:07.799
Have you ever seen this young man?

04:07.800 --> 04:09.519
He used to live over there.

04:09.520 --> 04:11.439
- You never saw him?
- No.

04:11.440 --> 04:13.839
You don't know where they went?
The people who lived there?

04:13.840 --> 04:15.359
I don't, no.

04:15.360 --> 04:17.678
- Would any of your neighbours know?
- I don't know.

04:17.680 --> 04:20.952
We keep ourselves to ourselves here.

04:26.880 --> 04:28.799
Are we there yet?

04:28.800 --> 04:30.279
Yes, we're here!

04:30.280 --> 04:33.719
It says "The Moon" -
there's a notice.

04:33.720 --> 04:36.399
We're supposed to be
the first ones here!

04:36.400 --> 04:37.799
Right.

04:37.800 --> 04:39.399
He IS funny.

04:39.400 --> 04:42.279
He's sort of funny and angry
at the same time!

04:42.280 --> 04:43.799
I always loved him.

04:43.800 --> 04:45.439
I will not pay, do you hear?

04:45.440 --> 04:47.799
I'm DEFINITELY not paying
half a crown.

04:47.800 --> 04:50.800
It's only thruppence in Hastings!

04:52.680 --> 04:54.519
Hello? Hello?

04:54.520 --> 04:56.840
Hello? Hello?

04:59.720 --> 05:02.439
Max, I don't believe it.
We're in luck!

05:02.440 --> 05:03.999
We're in luck?!

05:04.000 --> 05:06.199
They're charging us half a crown
for the deck chairs

05:06.200 --> 05:08.479
and we're all alone on the Moon
and we're in luck?!

05:08.480 --> 05:10.239
A Woolworths sign!

05:10.240 --> 05:13.239
Now, we can buy ANYTHING we want!

05:13.240 --> 05:16.968
- Mr Samuel!
- Not now, Courtney, not now!

05:21.520 --> 05:23.793
What's he saying, Esther?

05:25.960 --> 05:29.519
He's saying, "It's madness Mr Samuel
hasn't signed the contract."

05:29.520 --> 05:32.599
You haven't told me why.
And you have to tell me why.

05:32.600 --> 05:35.559
I need to know that we can trust
Mr Field.

05:35.560 --> 05:37.919
Trust! What do you mean, trust?

05:37.920 --> 05:40.439
This is the bloody government
we're talking about.

05:40.440 --> 05:43.479
I want to know exactly
who we're dealing with,

05:43.480 --> 05:47.279
and that is why I have requested
to speak to a more senior person.

05:47.280 --> 05:50.359
But that could take months,
by which time we'll be bust.

05:50.360 --> 05:54.399
Well, I will make sure
that it doesn't take months.

05:54.400 --> 05:56.999
Mr Samuel,
once the military start using it,

05:57.000 --> 05:58.839
the hospitals will follow.

05:58.840 --> 06:01.119
This will stop some people dying.

06:01.120 --> 06:02.839
Most certainly.

06:02.840 --> 06:04.479
But if we don't act now,

06:04.480 --> 06:06.359
someone else is going to do it,

06:06.360 --> 06:08.959
and we'll have lost everything!

06:08.960 --> 06:11.324
You can't let that happen.

06:34.200 --> 06:35.959
Mrs Shaw...

06:35.960 --> 06:37.999
I did knock, but you obviously
didn't hear me.

06:38.000 --> 06:41.679
Yes, we're looking
for something that I've mislaid.

06:41.680 --> 06:43.953
I have news, Mr Spearman.

06:45.280 --> 06:48.039
The property has changed hands.

06:48.040 --> 06:50.679
The owner is now living in
South Africa - a Mr Burridge.

06:50.680 --> 06:52.560
If you could...

06:54.840 --> 06:57.119
It never really tastes of coffee,
but there we are.

06:57.120 --> 06:58.679
If you could trace him,

06:58.680 --> 07:01.199
and find out if he has any
forwarding addresses, any records,

07:01.200 --> 07:03.239
and if you could interview
people in the street -

07:03.240 --> 07:05.319
I wasn't particularly good
at that part. Yes.

07:05.320 --> 07:06.719
I will do all these things.

07:06.720 --> 07:08.719
- Immediately?
- Immediately.

07:08.720 --> 07:11.119
It's amazing news, isn't it?

07:11.120 --> 07:15.319
It means he WAS alive,
h-he didn't just disappear to...

07:15.320 --> 07:16.959
To kill himself?

07:16.960 --> 07:18.679
Yes!

07:18.680 --> 07:21.159
And I've decided
to do something else.

07:21.160 --> 07:22.599
And what's that?

07:22.600 --> 07:25.319
I want to go public about Anthony's
disappearance.

07:25.320 --> 07:26.799
I see.

07:26.800 --> 07:29.239
It seems extraordinary to me
that it's taken this long,

07:29.240 --> 07:31.199
that I didn't do it at once.

07:31.200 --> 07:33.159
There were always reasons,
of course.

07:33.160 --> 07:35.719
People advised us that it might
frighten Anthony to go abroad

07:35.720 --> 07:37.399
where we would never find him,

07:37.400 --> 07:40.039
and then there was Richard's
position in the Conservative Party,

07:40.040 --> 07:42.279
and I accepted all those reasons.

07:42.280 --> 07:46.079
But then, suddenly, today, it seemed
totally inexplicable that I did.

07:46.080 --> 07:47.439
I'm sorry!

07:47.440 --> 07:52.159
- I'm rather excited, as you can see.
- Understandably.

07:52.160 --> 07:53.599
So...

07:53.600 --> 07:55.959
what are you planning to do,
Mrs Shaw?

07:55.960 --> 07:59.079
The first thing I want to do,
even before I go to the press,

07:59.080 --> 08:00.703
is really very simple -

08:00.704 --> 08:04.305
I want to plaster that street with
posters, with Anthony's picture,

08:04.306 --> 08:07.107
and the surrounding streets,
so that we can find some witnesses.

08:07.108 --> 08:09.209
It could be the quickest
route couldn't it?

08:09.210 --> 08:10.179
Maybe.

08:10.200 --> 08:12.559
Have you asked your husband
about this?

08:12.560 --> 08:14.159
Asked him?

08:14.160 --> 08:16.919
No, I don't need to,
not for the posters.

08:16.920 --> 08:19.039
Will you help me arrange it?

08:19.040 --> 08:20.679
"Dear Mrs Shaw."

08:20.680 --> 08:22.959
"I just thought I'd write
to let you know"

08:22.960 --> 08:26.839
"what I've done about investigating
your son Anthony's disappearance,"

08:26.840 --> 08:30.386
"because yesterday,
something happened."

08:31.120 --> 08:33.599
"I was off Games
because I have a cold."

08:33.600 --> 08:36.873
"Instead, we went for a sick walk..."

08:37.720 --> 08:40.719
"and it was being taken
by Mr Tezler."

08:40.720 --> 08:43.078
"And I thought,
'I have a chance now.'"

08:43.080 --> 08:45.879
"'I have to dare to ask him.'"

08:45.880 --> 08:49.439
- Sir? May I ask you something, sir?
- What is it, Petrukhin?

08:49.440 --> 08:52.239
You know Mrs Shaw came to see me
the other week?

08:52.240 --> 08:54.159
Did you teach her son Anthony, sir?

08:54.160 --> 08:56.199
I did. He was here some years ago.

08:56.200 --> 08:58.719
And does he ever come back
to visit the school, sir?

08:58.720 --> 09:00.279
He does not, no.

09:00.280 --> 09:02.519
And does he ever write to you sir?

09:02.520 --> 09:05.599
I don't remember him doing so, no.

09:05.600 --> 09:08.359
Do you remember most old boys
that write to you, sir?

09:08.360 --> 09:10.799
This is quite an interrogation,
Petrukhin!

09:10.800 --> 09:12.759
I DO remember most of them,

09:12.760 --> 09:16.599
but we have some very good records
as well, in the headmaster's study.

09:16.600 --> 09:18.359
Every letter is kept.

09:18.360 --> 09:21.799
And Anthony Shaw hasn't written
to you, or the headmaster, sir?

09:21.800 --> 09:23.639
Did I not just answer that?

09:23.640 --> 09:26.879
I don't believe he has, no.

09:26.880 --> 09:29.559
"Those were his very words"

09:29.560 --> 09:31.639
"'I don't believe he has, no.'."

09:31.640 --> 09:35.119
"Does Mr Tezler know Anthony's
disappeared, Mrs Shaw?"

09:35.120 --> 09:37.839
"I was just about to ask him that
when..."

09:37.840 --> 09:40.719
Stop!

09:40.720 --> 09:44.159
There is something disgusting
here, boys,

09:44.160 --> 09:47.719
quite disgusting,
and I can't let you pass.

09:47.720 --> 09:50.239
This is what happens
in our countryside today,

09:50.240 --> 09:51.999
and it is quite appalling.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.639
Rabbits, dying,

09:53.640 --> 09:56.719
of a disease made by man.

09:56.720 --> 09:59.239
There may be more ahead
in the woods.

09:59.240 --> 10:01.679
I can't let you see that.

10:01.680 --> 10:06.239
So - everybody back,
everybody back the way we came!

10:06.240 --> 10:10.999
And so my talk with him
was stopped by a dying rabbit.

10:11.000 --> 10:16.159
And after that, Mr Tezler marched
ahead, not talking to anybody.

10:16.160 --> 10:20.079
So, I want to report the first thing
I've found out, that they

10:20.080 --> 10:24.262
have these very good records.
Of the old boys.

10:31.520 --> 10:32.702
Mr Armstrong?

10:33.560 --> 10:36.379
Dick Armstrong, that's correct.

10:36.600 --> 10:38.599
You're admirably on time,
Mr Petrukhin.

10:38.600 --> 10:41.199
I'd heard you're very punctual.

10:41.200 --> 10:42.599
Would you like a drink?

10:42.600 --> 10:44.599
In a minute maybe, not just now.

10:44.600 --> 10:47.359
I hear you're a wine connoisseur.

10:47.360 --> 10:49.399
So, what can I do for you,
Mr Petrukhin?

10:49.400 --> 10:51.439
You know about Mr Field and
Mr Denning,

10:51.440 --> 10:55.719
and how they've asked me to obtain
information about a certain family?

10:55.720 --> 10:59.439
And what you found out from your two
visits so far has been very useful.

10:59.440 --> 11:01.159
Why?

11:01.160 --> 11:03.679
- What do you mean why?
- How has it been useful?

11:03.680 --> 11:09.044
What have the Shaw family -
what has this family been doing?

11:09.480 --> 11:11.199
We have reason to believe
that people

11:11.200 --> 11:13.719
they've been connected
with are enemies of the state.

11:13.720 --> 11:16.599
- In what way? That's what we have to.
- Find out, but clearly this is not

11:16.600 --> 11:20.782
the place for me to go into any
further detail.

11:21.080 --> 11:23.626
And Mr Field and Mr Denning?

11:24.600 --> 11:27.237
I'm not sure how to put this.

11:27.400 --> 11:29.119
- Hello, David.
- Dick, how are you?

11:29.120 --> 11:30.732
I'm very well, thank you.
How are you?

11:30.733 --> 11:32.330
Good.
Are you going to the do tonight?

11:32.331 --> 11:33.599
I most certainly am.

11:33.600 --> 11:35.964
Right, I'll see you there.

11:37.000 --> 11:39.999
Yes? Mr Field and Mr Denning.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.559
Are they to be relied on?

11:41.560 --> 11:45.639
Well, I can vouch for them
as first class officers

11:45.640 --> 11:46.879
if that's what you're asking?

11:46.880 --> 11:50.519
And you're monitoring what they're
doing all the time? Of course.

11:50.520 --> 11:53.119
And what is your rank
Mr Armstrong, if I may ask?

11:53.120 --> 11:54.160
My rank?

11:56.160 --> 11:57.615
I am their boss.

11:58.560 --> 12:00.319
Will that do?

12:00.320 --> 12:03.279
We do know what we're doing,
if that's what you mean?

12:03.280 --> 12:07.759
Miss Prideaux will go to each house,
give them a poster, and explain

12:07.760 --> 12:12.701
we've got official permission to do
this, it is approved by the council.

12:12.702 --> 12:15.027
And then you'll interview
all the residents?

12:15.028 --> 12:16.036
I will.

12:22.560 --> 12:24.200
Turn, turn.

12:25.760 --> 12:29.124
I've always liked this
picture of him.

12:29.960 --> 12:32.959
Make sure you reach, otherwise...

12:32.960 --> 12:34.051
There we go.

13:21.680 --> 13:26.879
Mr Petrukhin, I see Guy has been
waiting for you.

13:26.880 --> 13:28.679
Here is what you want.

13:28.680 --> 13:29.959
I've signed it.

13:29.960 --> 13:32.279
What we all want, Mr Petrukhin.

13:32.280 --> 13:33.719
We're off.

13:33.720 --> 13:36.630
We're about to change the world.

13:38.600 --> 13:41.639
Why does your dog understand
some Russian words?

13:43.600 --> 13:44.679
That's all his fault.

13:44.680 --> 13:47.959
William was attached to our embassy
in Moscow for three years.

13:47.960 --> 13:50.319
And I like showing off my Russian.

13:50.320 --> 13:52.599
Guy is a very good audience.

13:52.600 --> 13:55.879
Is that what's been worrying you
all this time, Mr Petrukhin?

13:55.880 --> 13:58.790
That we might have a Soviet dog?

13:59.320 --> 14:01.759
So, what do you want me to do?
Because there's always a catch,

14:01.760 --> 14:04.599
- isn't there? We want you to go back.
- To the house, to the Shaws' house,

14:04.600 --> 14:07.359
- one more time.
- I won't be invited there again.

14:07.360 --> 14:09.959
They have become suspicious about me
taking photos,

14:09.960 --> 14:11.879
they've started me
asking a lot of questions.

14:11.880 --> 14:14.119
But they also like you, don't they?

14:14.120 --> 14:15.879
They like you very much.

14:15.880 --> 14:17.999
Do they? How do you know that?

14:18.000 --> 14:22.273
Well, we only have to
look at these photographs.

14:24.160 --> 14:27.433
It's almost a love affair, isn't it?

14:29.960 --> 14:34.506
There's something about you
they really appreciate.

14:34.600 --> 14:37.319
So, you just have to take Mr Shaw
out for lunch. That'll get

14:37.320 --> 14:38.959
the ball rolling again, I'm sure.

14:38.960 --> 14:40.439
And we'll pay for the meal,
of course.

14:40.440 --> 14:42.559
And why would I want to go back?

14:42.560 --> 14:45.079
Apart from it being my patriotic
duty, of course?

14:45.080 --> 14:47.319
For the same reason.
Because you like them very much.

14:47.320 --> 14:48.839
You know that too, do you?

14:48.840 --> 14:52.279
- It's obvious, isn't it?
- All the photos tell us that.

14:52.280 --> 14:56.399
And if somehow they're keeping bad
company, and you can help them

14:56.400 --> 14:59.519
by stopping that, you'd want to do
that, wouldn't you?

14:59.520 --> 15:01.080
Help save them.

15:02.520 --> 15:05.559
- Save them? Yes, there's something.
- You don't know, Mr Petrukhin,

15:05.560 --> 15:08.919
because it was never been made
public - their son Anthony

15:08.920 --> 15:13.639
went missing the day after his
21st birthday, five years ago.

15:13.640 --> 15:15.559
And no-one has ever been
able to find him.

15:15.560 --> 15:17.919
I hadn't heard that, no.

15:17.920 --> 15:20.759
What a terrible thing to happen.
And nobody knows why?

15:20.760 --> 15:22.799
- No.
- So talk to them about it.

15:22.800 --> 15:25.759
They'll want somebody to confide to.
They'll appreciate it.

15:25.760 --> 15:27.519
And how am I meant to know about it?

15:27.520 --> 15:30.759
Probably because your daughter told
you.

15:30.760 --> 15:33.359
I'm pretty sure she must know.

15:33.360 --> 15:35.959
You see, there's so much in your
pictures.

15:35.960 --> 15:38.324
Isn't there, Mr Petrukhin?

15:40.440 --> 15:42.959
And what do you want me to do
if I get invited back again?

15:42.960 --> 15:45.599
- Something very small, in fact.
- Indeed.

15:45.600 --> 15:48.599
We just want you to memorise
the layout of the whole house,

15:48.600 --> 15:50.439
who uses which room.

15:50.440 --> 15:51.759
If we're going to bug the place,

15:51.760 --> 15:53.959
we'll need an accurate
description of the interior.

15:53.960 --> 15:55.759
You can't just listen
to their phone calls?

15:55.760 --> 15:57.919
- Wouldn't that be simpler?
- We're already doing that.

15:57.920 --> 16:00.279
But nothing of interest is ever
mentioned in their calls.

16:00.280 --> 16:01.919
I expect they know we're listening.

16:01.920 --> 16:06.679
So, contrary to your worst fears,
Mr Petrukhin,

16:06.680 --> 16:09.317
the tasks are getting easier!

16:24.840 --> 16:28.022
Giorgio, this is the gentlemen.

16:28.680 --> 16:30.279
Samuel, do forgive me!

16:30.280 --> 16:32.679
Politicians are always late,
aren't they?

16:32.680 --> 16:35.719
It's the only thing they can be
relied on to do consistently.

16:35.720 --> 16:37.599
Please, don't worry.
I haven't been here long.

16:37.600 --> 16:39.964
Liar, I'm 20 minutes late!

16:40.600 --> 16:42.639
Soldiers are always on time
on the other hand,

16:42.640 --> 16:45.199
so I still really mind
when I keep people waiting.

16:45.200 --> 16:47.519
The whole restaurant seems to
have recognised you.

16:47.520 --> 16:49.039
I pretend I can't see it.

16:49.040 --> 16:51.439
If you take it seriously, it does
funny things to your brain.

16:51.440 --> 16:54.119
The lady over there asked if you'd
autograph this for her, sir.

16:54.120 --> 16:55.484
Yes, of course.

17:02.920 --> 17:05.279
Does that happen every
time you go out?

17:05.280 --> 17:06.358
Nearly always.

17:06.359 --> 17:09.159
It's because I was in the newsreels
during the war.

17:09.160 --> 17:10.199
Of course, I remember.

17:10.200 --> 17:15.239
And they made a movie of my book, so
I became famous by accident really.

17:15.240 --> 17:19.150
Anyway, it'll pass.
These things never last.

17:19.200 --> 17:24.279
That's why it's so wonderful when
one can be oneself for a change.

17:24.280 --> 17:26.638
To be tremendously silly,

17:26.640 --> 17:29.559
like we were with our little
adventure with the lorry.

17:29.560 --> 17:30.480
Indeed!

17:30.482 --> 17:33.239
And with the world in such
a perilous state, a little fun

17:33.240 --> 17:35.599
is essential, don't you agree? I do.

17:35.600 --> 17:37.439
And it's so hard to find,
at the moment.

17:37.440 --> 17:39.239
It is, Samuel.

17:39.240 --> 17:43.559
The Russians, the Russians,
the Russians.

17:43.560 --> 17:45.119
Is that why you asked me
out to lunch,

17:45.120 --> 17:47.279
so that we could make
idiots of ourselves again?

17:47.280 --> 17:50.159
- I really hope it is!
- Absolutely.

17:50.160 --> 17:52.559
That was an amazing day,
when we went fishing.

17:52.560 --> 17:54.197
It was, wasn't it?

17:55.960 --> 17:59.879
Well, you must come again as soon as
you are able, you and your wife.

17:59.880 --> 18:01.079
I'm sure we would love that.

18:01.080 --> 18:04.279
- In fact, next week we have a gathering.
- A gathering?

18:04.280 --> 18:08.519
Yes, Walter is giving a talk of huge
importance apparently.

18:08.520 --> 18:09.559
What's it about?

18:09.560 --> 18:12.359
Something crucial according
to Walter.

18:12.360 --> 18:13.906
Not to be missed.

18:19.840 --> 18:21.479
We've watched the television
all night

18:21.480 --> 18:24.359
and you've not said
a single word, Samuel.

18:24.360 --> 18:26.199
I know.

18:26.200 --> 18:27.879
Something has happened, hasn't it?

18:27.880 --> 18:29.679
I wish you'd tell me.

18:29.680 --> 18:33.719
Is it the factory?
Is business very difficult?

18:33.720 --> 18:36.266
We have a situation at work.

18:36.720 --> 18:42.084
Two groups of people, I don't know
which of them to believe.

18:43.560 --> 18:46.599
Then you have to keep asking
the right questions, keep digging

18:46.600 --> 18:51.419
until you've worked it out,
as you always do, my dear.

18:51.520 --> 18:53.248
I must work it out.

18:55.120 --> 18:58.030
I have one favour to ask of you,

18:59.280 --> 19:04.553
Will you come to the Shaws' with me?
One last time? Please.

19:06.960 --> 19:08.599
Back so soon?

19:08.600 --> 19:10.839
I thought you were
staying at the ball all night?

19:10.840 --> 19:14.479
Well, I changed my mind. It wasn't
very well attended.

19:14.480 --> 19:17.159
Don't worry, I'm not missing
anything with this one.

19:17.160 --> 19:21.160
There were hardly any men
there, for a start.

19:27.200 --> 19:28.640
Hello!

19:30.160 --> 19:36.615
Don't worry, you're all quite safe.
The she-devil is having a night off.

19:39.440 --> 19:40.480
Hannah?

19:41.880 --> 19:43.119
Dad?

19:43.120 --> 19:45.393
I'm sorry to disturb you.

19:45.960 --> 19:50.051
I have to ask you something
important, Hannah.

19:50.200 --> 19:51.719
Yes, Dad?

19:51.720 --> 19:55.599
Did you know that Mrs Shaw's son
Anthony had disappeared?

19:55.600 --> 19:56.640
I did, yes.

19:57.880 --> 20:01.599
She told me not to tell anyone,
so I thought it was best not to.

20:01.600 --> 20:03.799
Right. I'm not angry.

20:03.800 --> 20:05.800
I just needed to know.

20:06.880 --> 20:09.679
I'm so pleased
she decided to tell you.

20:09.680 --> 20:13.519
It's extraordinary, isn't it, him
just vanishing like that?

20:13.520 --> 20:15.239
Yes.

20:15.240 --> 20:18.786
I'm glad we've
resolved our differences.

20:23.880 --> 20:26.759
You won't ever go away, will you?

20:26.760 --> 20:28.000
Like that?

20:29.960 --> 20:31.480
Of course not.

20:33.640 --> 20:35.799
I'm so glad you decided to come.

20:35.800 --> 20:39.879
Yes, you never know what to
expect at this house.

20:39.880 --> 20:41.639
And we're staying the night!

20:41.640 --> 20:45.095
God knows what that's
going to be like.

20:54.880 --> 20:56.879
- Welcome back.
- Hello, Kevin.

20:56.880 --> 21:00.159
And it's perfect timing.
Esther's mother has a new boyfriend

21:00.160 --> 21:02.079
and she's over at his place tonight.

21:02.080 --> 21:03.990
So, we're on our own!

21:09.680 --> 21:10.919
Hello, Hannah.

21:10.920 --> 21:12.359
So, you're both here.

21:12.360 --> 21:13.919
Do you two always go round together?

21:13.920 --> 21:16.439
- A lot of the time. Especially.
- When we know you're coming.

21:16.440 --> 21:18.679
- How've you been?
- OK.

21:18.680 --> 21:21.599
- I've got a night off, so that's good.
- Yes.

21:21.600 --> 21:24.239
All the dreadful balls
and parties you've had to go to,

21:24.240 --> 21:25.279
five days a week!

21:25.280 --> 21:28.719
We can't wait to hear about that,
how tough it's been.

21:28.720 --> 21:31.902
Well, I won't disappoint you, then.

21:32.760 --> 21:34.959
I have a little film for you.

21:34.960 --> 21:39.479
It will surprise you, it may shock
you,

21:39.480 --> 21:42.359
indeed I hope it will shock you,

21:42.360 --> 21:46.879
because what it shows is intensely
serious.

21:46.880 --> 21:49.999
Something is happening all over our
country,

21:50.000 --> 21:53.839
something that is irreversible.

21:53.840 --> 21:57.568
I shall be answering questions
afterwards.

21:58.560 --> 22:01.742
Don't be put off by the commentary.

22:06.880 --> 22:08.399
Old England.

22:08.400 --> 22:10.999
We are all familiar
with its historic sites.

22:11.000 --> 22:14.759
Its ancient cities,
the Mother of Parliaments, the land

22:14.760 --> 22:19.851
of Shakespeare, but something is
stirring in Old England.

22:20.680 --> 22:25.159
These buildings that many of us
treasure, that give Old England its

22:25.160 --> 22:28.799
fair face, the face it shows to the
rest of the world, these buildings

22:28.800 --> 22:34.255
are now threatened and many more
have already been destroyed.

22:38.000 --> 22:43.182
Terrible, isn't it? Everything
I knew as a child is going.

22:44.040 --> 22:48.280
The destruction, Walter, the
destruction!

22:49.480 --> 22:51.199
And the scale of it.

22:51.200 --> 22:54.879
Old England is destroying its past.
The buildings that defied.

22:54.880 --> 22:57.999
Hitler's Luftwaffe are now
facing a new threat.

22:58.000 --> 23:01.039
All over the country,
the great stately palaces,

23:01.040 --> 23:03.999
the grand town halls,
even the Mother of Parliaments

23:04.000 --> 23:08.639
itself are being destroyed or are
being threatened with destruction.

23:08.640 --> 23:09.999
The reason for this?

23:10.000 --> 23:12.799
An urgent desire in this ancient
land to embrace

23:12.800 --> 23:14.982
the future at all costs.

23:28.600 --> 23:31.479
Someone else had to leave, I see.

23:31.480 --> 23:33.479
And you're writing notes, too!

23:33.480 --> 23:36.639
It just makes one
so angry, doesn't it?

23:36.640 --> 23:38.119
It does make one angry, yes.

23:38.120 --> 23:40.759
It's not that one shouldn't get
rid of some of the past.

23:40.760 --> 23:43.359
Of course one should
knock down a lot that is old.

23:43.360 --> 23:45.799
But what really upsets me

23:45.800 --> 23:49.999
is the stupidity of the people
who are doing it,

23:50.000 --> 23:55.639
how they overreact, how they don't
realise it's a question of balance.

23:55.640 --> 23:59.199
It's all or nothing.
It always is with these people.

23:59.200 --> 24:02.359
And now we come back to the
Houses of Parliament.

24:02.360 --> 24:05.639
The Palace of Westminster,
could it be next?

24:05.640 --> 24:07.559
Could we see it razed to the ground

24:07.560 --> 24:10.079
and a new home be
born for the Mother of Parliaments?

24:10.080 --> 24:12.559
And there is a plan to demolish it.

24:12.560 --> 24:14.559
There really is!

24:14.560 --> 24:17.759
- I feel so sorry for you, Mr Petrukhin.
- Sorry for me?

24:17.760 --> 24:22.719
Yes, I'm sorry because you couldn't
have expected such a sombre evening.

24:22.720 --> 24:24.239
I didn't know what to expect.

24:24.240 --> 24:28.695
Certainly not a lecture on Victorian
architecture.

24:29.480 --> 24:31.519
I had to pop out too.

24:31.520 --> 24:35.279
There's a limit to how long you can
watch buildings being demolished.

24:35.280 --> 24:39.119
So, Old England is
indeed at a crossroads.

24:39.120 --> 24:43.939
When we next visit, how much of it
will there be left?

24:44.800 --> 24:47.319
So, how is Hannah,
your lovely daughter?

24:47.320 --> 24:48.359
She's very well.

24:48.360 --> 24:51.559
She enjoyed you accompanying
her to the ball so much.

24:51.560 --> 24:56.379
I think she wishes you could be
with her at every one.

24:56.640 --> 24:59.004
She told me about Anthony.

25:00.880 --> 25:02.426
So, she told you.

25:03.360 --> 25:06.119
She didn't mean to.
It just slipped out.

25:06.120 --> 25:07.479
Yes.

25:07.480 --> 25:10.439
Yes, it's good that Hannah told you.

25:10.440 --> 25:12.159
It's not going to be
a private matter

25:12.160 --> 25:14.959
now for very much longer anyway.

25:14.960 --> 25:16.359
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to pry.

25:16.360 --> 25:18.919
No, you're not prying, Samuel.

25:18.920 --> 25:22.011
I have something to tell you, now.

25:22.200 --> 25:24.079
To confess.

25:24.080 --> 25:27.439
Sasha's boarding school is where
Anthony went to school.

25:27.440 --> 25:30.719
And it is one of the first reasons
I wanted to get to know you -

25:30.720 --> 25:33.759
any connection to him
I come across I tend to seize.

25:33.760 --> 25:37.119
- That's perfectly understandable.
- It's not very logical, is it?

25:37.120 --> 25:40.159
But it's how I've been
thinking all this time,

25:40.160 --> 25:44.797
until this week, anyway,
just clutching at anything.

25:44.920 --> 25:50.239
I've been thinking about your
invention, Samuel, your bleeper.

25:50.240 --> 25:52.877
If our children carried them.

25:53.000 --> 25:57.039
And it worked outside, over an
entire city, for instance.

25:57.040 --> 25:58.919
Then we could find them,
whenever we wanted.

25:58.920 --> 26:00.359
That would be wonderful, yes!

26:00.360 --> 26:03.542
Yes, yes, it would, truly
wonderful.

26:04.360 --> 26:07.906
If only I could bleep
Anthony right now!

26:09.000 --> 26:10.919
Of course, they'd hate us for it.

26:10.920 --> 26:12.319
If we could always find them.

26:12.320 --> 26:14.599
Not if we used it properly.

26:14.600 --> 26:17.559
If we only used it when we had to,
they wouldn't hate us then.

26:17.560 --> 26:20.039
And they could find us, too.

26:20.040 --> 26:21.677
If they wanted us.

26:23.200 --> 26:28.837
You realise I love your invention,
Samuel, and so does Richard.

26:38.680 --> 26:40.999
It's amazing how good
a dancer she is.

26:41.000 --> 26:42.760
Yes, isn't it?

26:46.000 --> 26:49.039
Come on, we can't just watch -
it's not allowed!

26:49.040 --> 26:51.760
No, not yet, Joel! Please!

27:07.480 --> 27:10.959
Are we the only people staying
the night, do you think?

27:10.960 --> 27:13.919
- We can't be, surely!
- Goodnight!

27:13.920 --> 27:17.193
Anyway, it's not been too bad
so far.

27:18.880 --> 27:20.880
And this room is nice.

28:23.760 --> 28:25.397
There you are.

28:28.480 --> 28:30.399
Come and join me.

28:30.400 --> 28:31.599
Thank you.

28:31.600 --> 28:33.146
I couldn't sleep.

28:34.440 --> 28:39.519
It's always difficult the first
night in a new house, isn't it?

28:39.520 --> 28:40.560
Of course.

28:43.040 --> 28:46.559
Two glasses? Like you were
expecting somebody.

28:46.560 --> 28:48.742
Yes, well, I was hoping.

28:52.280 --> 28:56.462
Without the sound, it's quite
moving, isn't it?

28:56.920 --> 29:00.193
I'm so glad they sent you back here.

29:01.040 --> 29:02.439
Richard invited me.

29:02.440 --> 29:05.799
He's going to get a bit of a shock
isn't he, your Mr Field,

29:05.800 --> 29:07.839
when he finds out it was just a
meeting for the.

29:07.840 --> 29:12.319
Society of the Preservation of
Victorian Buildings.

29:12.320 --> 29:13.502
So, Samuel...

29:15.280 --> 29:17.190
what's this about?

29:18.680 --> 29:22.839
Why are they so interested in what's
happening here?

29:22.840 --> 29:25.399
It's time you knew, isn't it?

29:25.400 --> 29:28.673
I would like to know
everything, yes.

29:30.520 --> 29:33.479
The Russian penetration
of the secret service is on a bigger

29:33.480 --> 29:36.026
scale than even I suspected.

29:36.600 --> 29:39.319
Both in MI5 and in MI6.

29:39.320 --> 29:41.411
It goes seriously deep.

29:42.240 --> 29:45.839
Quite extraordinarily, there's
even a Russian spy that

29:45.840 --> 29:48.879
comes into close contact with
Her Majesty the Queen on a regular

29:48.880 --> 29:52.919
basis, and he's been allowed to keep
his job, because his public

29:52.920 --> 29:57.679
unmasking would cause unbelievable
embarrassment to the government.

29:57.680 --> 30:03.639
It is quite possible that the head
of MI5 himself is a Soviet agent.

30:03.640 --> 30:08.600
That's how high up the Russian
penetration has got.

30:11.200 --> 30:14.199
Myself, Richard, and a handful
of others are determined to

30:14.200 --> 30:16.919
expose this situation,
both in Parliament and in the press,

30:16.920 --> 30:20.648
when we have gathered
sufficient evidence.

30:20.680 --> 30:27.279
Your Mr Field keeps sending you back
here to find out how much evidence

30:27.280 --> 30:29.735
we have managed to uncover.

30:31.040 --> 30:34.950
So, Samuel, what are you going to
tell them?

30:35.280 --> 30:37.599
I'm just going to install the staff
locator at an airbase

30:37.600 --> 30:39.039
and then I'm done with them.

30:39.040 --> 30:42.404
I just hope their interest
is genuine.

30:49.000 --> 30:50.999
And what happened to Anthony?

30:51.000 --> 30:54.559
Can anything be more upsetting
for a parent than one's child to

30:54.560 --> 30:57.000
vanish into thin air?

30:58.720 --> 31:00.399
So, what happened, Arthur?

31:00.400 --> 31:01.759
Nobody knows.

31:01.760 --> 31:03.719
But I expect
they tried to recruit him.

31:03.720 --> 31:06.279
The secret service? Recruit him?

31:06.280 --> 31:11.479
The people that you suspect of being
Soviet spies? A 20-year-old boy?

31:11.480 --> 31:16.159
The truth is nobody knows what
happened to Anthony.

31:16.160 --> 31:21.615
Despite all of our efforts, it's
been impossible to find out.

31:21.640 --> 31:26.479
So, Samuel, are you going to tell
Mr Field that it was just an evening

31:26.480 --> 31:28.679
devoted to Victorian architecture?

31:28.680 --> 31:31.862
I'm not going to tell him anything.

31:33.440 --> 31:35.719
You may wonder

31:35.720 --> 31:39.879
why I didn't stop you
being invited back here, Samuel.

31:39.880 --> 31:42.279
I was wondering that, yes.

31:42.280 --> 31:46.519
It's because I wanted to be able to
give you one more piece of advice.

31:46.520 --> 31:50.439
Try to get away from them
as soon as you can.

31:50.440 --> 31:53.077
That's easier said than done.

31:53.080 --> 31:55.599
I need the business they're
providing.

31:55.600 --> 32:00.159
Samuel! Now, please,
please listen to this.

32:00.160 --> 32:02.959
The moment that's finished,
get away from them.

32:02.960 --> 32:06.319
Because if they think you suspect
them, they may well find a way,

32:06.320 --> 32:09.319
a surprising way mind you,

32:09.320 --> 32:11.593
but they'll find a way...

32:12.360 --> 32:14.319
of disappearing you.

32:14.320 --> 32:15.775
Disappearing me?

32:18.200 --> 32:20.199
Yes.

32:20.200 --> 32:21.564
Of killing you.

32:23.480 --> 32:28.640
Wherever You Are by
Richard Blandon & The Dubs

33:03.440 --> 33:05.640
Joel, please, stop.

33:12.680 --> 33:16.919
Everywhere I go I've been doing
things that get me stared at.

33:16.920 --> 33:21.284
- Is that bad?
- Well, it's not very comfortable.

33:22.560 --> 33:25.015
If my dad could see me now!

33:26.200 --> 33:28.837
Or a few seconds ago, anyway.

33:43.960 --> 33:46.415
Off games again, Petrukhin?

33:48.160 --> 33:50.639
I'm beginning to think it's
deliberate.

33:50.640 --> 33:53.320
Steady, and off you go!

34:01.000 --> 34:03.199
Hamilton! What is the meaning of
this?

34:03.200 --> 34:05.119
I've injured my foot, sir.

34:05.120 --> 34:06.599
You've injured your what?

34:06.600 --> 34:08.119
I've injured my foot!

34:08.120 --> 34:10.393
A boy is injured, matron!

34:11.360 --> 34:12.879
Matron!

34:12.880 --> 34:15.239
Can you hop? Hop, hop!

34:28.920 --> 34:31.998
- Can you see anything seriously wrong?
- Not again, Hamilton.

34:32.000 --> 34:33.909
Now, can you do this?

35:13.040 --> 35:17.222
What in heaven's name are you
doing, Petrukhin?

35:19.960 --> 35:23.839
I was just looking
if I could find a letter.

35:23.840 --> 35:27.750
You have broken
into the Headmaster's study.

35:28.160 --> 35:31.433
And into the school's
private papers.

35:33.240 --> 35:36.604
You have committed a crime,
Petrukhin.

36:11.040 --> 36:14.199
Who did this?
Who pulled all the posters down?

36:14.200 --> 36:16.079
I didn't see anything.

36:16.080 --> 36:17.519
Maybe it was the council.

36:17.520 --> 36:20.039
But we had permission to do this.

36:20.040 --> 36:21.919
Someone must've seen something?!

36:21.920 --> 36:23.079
Who saw something?

36:23.080 --> 36:24.559
Someone must've done!

36:24.560 --> 36:28.159
There were posters here of my son,
who is missing.

36:28.160 --> 36:30.719
- And they've all been taken down.
- I didn't see anything.

36:30.720 --> 36:35.175
Please! Somebody,
somebody must know who did this.

36:37.040 --> 36:39.519
Please! There were a whole
lot of posters here,

36:39.520 --> 36:41.999
and someone has pulled them
all down.

36:42.000 --> 36:43.519
Did you see something?

36:43.520 --> 36:48.884
Please, for God's sake,
one of you must have seen something!

36:51.800 --> 36:53.479
Did you see something?

36:53.480 --> 36:54.935
Don't be afraid.

36:55.560 --> 36:58.679
There were posters here.
They were of my son, you see,

36:58.680 --> 37:00.959
and he's gone missing.

37:00.960 --> 37:02.960
Did you see something?

37:03.480 --> 37:04.520
Please?

37:08.880 --> 37:10.153
I think I did.

37:11.880 --> 37:12.919
Yes?

37:12.920 --> 37:14.920
Two men were in a car.

37:15.240 --> 37:16.679
A blue car.

37:19.200 --> 37:20.719
Marylebone 2629?

37:20.720 --> 37:22.519
The posters have all gone.

37:22.520 --> 37:24.119
They've been torn down!

37:24.120 --> 37:26.479
- Torn down? You got permission,
- didn't you?

37:26.480 --> 37:27.599
I did, absolutely.

37:27.600 --> 37:30.559
Well, you've got to find out who
did it, who it was.

37:30.560 --> 37:33.679
There were two men in a blue car,
a little girl told me.

37:33.680 --> 37:36.679
I need you to get to the street and
find out who it was.

37:36.680 --> 37:39.479
Tomorrow afternoon I will go down
there and I'll... No, today.

37:39.480 --> 37:41.662
You have to do it today.

37:43.680 --> 37:47.479
Now, Petrukhin, your offence is
so grave

37:47.480 --> 37:51.399
that Mr Tezler and I have decided on
the following course of action.

37:51.400 --> 37:53.559
Your parents are due to come
and visit you on Sunday,

37:53.560 --> 37:58.079
so your punishment will be delayed
until after that visit -

37:58.080 --> 38:00.359
until we've discussed
the situation with them.

38:00.360 --> 38:05.279
You could either face expulsion,
Petrukhin, or, yes, the hairbrush

38:05.280 --> 38:08.959
many times over in front of the
whole school.

38:08.960 --> 38:11.079
Or the cane.

38:11.080 --> 38:13.799
It will all be decided on Sunday.

38:13.800 --> 38:17.639
The full site is about eight times
larger than the portion

38:17.640 --> 38:20.439
we did in the demonstration
for the top brass.

38:20.440 --> 38:22.959
To cover that distance,
we have to have the strongest

38:22.960 --> 38:24.999
transmission signal we've ever
attempted.

38:25.000 --> 38:29.199
We have to place the transmitters
here and here.

38:29.200 --> 38:32.159
- And probably here too...
- Yes, Courtney.

38:32.160 --> 38:35.599
But the most important thing is this.
We have to get the job

38:35.600 --> 38:39.279
done as fast as we can,
and then get the hell out of there.

38:39.280 --> 38:42.917
And then find ourselves some
new clients.

38:50.080 --> 38:53.079
I have something to tell you,
Richard.

38:53.080 --> 38:56.359
Shall I take out my hearing aid,
so you can pretend I'm not here?

38:56.360 --> 38:59.815
No, I want you to listen
to this, Mary.

39:00.960 --> 39:04.839
I was given a possible address for
Anthony by his friend Paul Ledbury.

39:04.840 --> 39:06.839
You were? When was this?

39:06.840 --> 39:08.399
You never told me!

39:08.400 --> 39:09.719
A couple of weeks ago.

39:09.720 --> 39:11.799
I went to the address.
He wasn't there

39:11.800 --> 39:14.399
and no-one was able to tell me
anything.

39:14.400 --> 39:16.399
But I had posters put
up in the street.

39:16.400 --> 39:17.599
Posters?

39:17.600 --> 39:20.055
- You put posters up?
- Yes.

39:20.560 --> 39:23.119
And someone had them all torn down.

39:23.120 --> 39:25.159
Did they indeed?

39:25.160 --> 39:27.679
And who would do that?
Was it people in the street?

39:27.680 --> 39:30.439
I don't know. Mr Spearman is
finding out.

39:30.440 --> 39:33.599
You did all this without telling me,
Kathleen.

39:33.600 --> 39:37.359
Yes, and I'm sorry. I should've told
you, of course I should.

39:37.360 --> 39:40.039
But I was completely wrapped
up in getting it done,

39:40.040 --> 39:43.119
I so wanted to have something
positive to tell you.

39:43.120 --> 39:45.393
But an address for him...

39:46.680 --> 39:48.039
That's a wonderful lead!

39:48.040 --> 39:50.879
That's what we've been waiting for!

39:50.880 --> 39:52.399
What happens now?

39:52.400 --> 39:55.799
I know what I have to do
next, Richard.

39:55.800 --> 39:58.437
I'm going to go to the press.

39:58.680 --> 40:01.319
That is a big step, Kathleen.

40:01.320 --> 40:04.775
The whole world will
know our business.

40:05.240 --> 40:08.059
Why not? It's high time we did.

40:08.800 --> 40:10.839
Why didn't we do it before?

40:10.840 --> 40:15.477
We've been locked in a situation,
a way of thinking.

40:16.400 --> 40:19.000
Yes, let's do it.

40:39.520 --> 40:42.520
Any minute now we should hear it.

40:45.440 --> 40:47.119
I wonder what he wants.

40:47.120 --> 40:48.799
Morning, gentlemen.

40:48.800 --> 40:51.639
We're just testing
the range of the transmitters.

40:51.640 --> 40:52.839
And it works!

40:52.840 --> 40:55.199
We should be able to find anybody
over the entire base!

40:55.200 --> 40:56.679
Splendid.

40:56.680 --> 40:58.879
I just want a word with
Mr Petrukhin, here.

40:58.880 --> 41:01.480
Hallelujah!

41:02.880 --> 41:06.119
These young men are going mad
with boredom here.

41:06.120 --> 41:10.959
When the base is fully operational
again things will be better.

41:10.960 --> 41:13.599
You haven't supplied what
we asked for -

41:13.600 --> 41:16.719
details of the interior
of the Shaws' house.

41:16.720 --> 41:18.399
I have written it all down.

41:18.400 --> 41:20.519
I was going to send it to you.

41:20.520 --> 41:22.520
May I call you Samuel?

41:23.360 --> 41:24.799
Certainly.

41:24.800 --> 41:26.399
What do I call you?

41:26.400 --> 41:27.679
Robert.

41:27.680 --> 41:32.599
Samuel, you wanted to know more,
about that house, about the Shaws.

41:32.600 --> 41:35.599
So, I'm going to tell you some more.

41:35.600 --> 41:36.799
It's about time, isn't it?

41:36.800 --> 41:40.079
We believe they are using
that house as a base

41:40.080 --> 41:44.990
for their meetings,
their discussions, and their plans.

41:45.360 --> 41:47.679
Plans that amount to treason.

41:47.680 --> 41:50.279
What do you mean "they"?
Who are "they"?

41:50.280 --> 41:53.999
Some very senior army commanders,
members of the House of Lords,

41:54.000 --> 41:57.199
the House of Commons, a top
civil servant or two,

41:57.200 --> 42:01.519
a newspaper magnate - who are all
completely opposed to the

42:01.520 --> 42:04.799
dismantling of the British Empire,
the granting of independence to

42:04.800 --> 42:09.679
our colonies, they are also furious
about our national humiliation

42:09.680 --> 42:15.119
after the Suez fiasco and our loss
of influence in the world.

42:15.120 --> 42:21.030
And they are planning to take over
the government of this country.

42:21.680 --> 42:22.720
By force.

42:24.200 --> 42:26.919
And they hope to do
this from a house in Hertfordshire?

42:26.920 --> 42:28.719
Well, that's what we're
trying to find out.

42:28.720 --> 42:32.559
We're trying to obtain evidence
about what they're plotting,

42:32.560 --> 42:37.159
exact plans and how they're
going to activate them.

42:37.160 --> 42:39.919
So, if you can send us what you've
got, Samuel, it would

42:39.920 --> 42:45.648
be tremendously helpful, make
what we've got to do a lot easier.

42:46.080 --> 42:50.399
I know how captivated
you are by that house,

42:50.400 --> 42:53.679
and you're even more captivated
by some of the people in it.

42:53.680 --> 42:56.226
But you ought to believe me.

42:57.240 --> 42:58.799
Yes.

42:58.800 --> 43:01.679
So, do we understand each other now?

43:01.680 --> 43:05.317
I think we understand each other,
Robert.

43:07.720 --> 43:10.520
Come on, come on. Come on!

44:07.360 --> 44:08.551
Number, please.

44:08.552 --> 44:12.371
Operator.
Can I please have Stevenage 5471?

44:41.520 --> 44:46.479
It looks like the little blighter
has been using that phone box.

44:46.480 --> 44:49.662
I think he's around here somewhere.

45:41.600 --> 45:42.639
Missed the bus?

45:42.640 --> 45:44.479
Yes.

45:44.480 --> 45:46.079
There's not another one for an hour.

45:46.080 --> 45:47.839
For an hour?

45:47.840 --> 45:50.159
- Where are you going?
- To the station.

45:50.160 --> 45:53.160
Well, jump in. I'm passing there.

45:54.400 --> 45:58.582
Well, make your mind up.
I haven't got all day.

46:09.720 --> 46:13.637
There's a very urgent phone
call for you, Mr Samuel.

46:13.638 --> 46:16.919
- Samuel? Sasha has run away from school.
- He's done what?

46:16.920 --> 46:19.559
The school has been out looking for
him. They haven't found him.

46:19.560 --> 46:22.439
They've called the police now.
Apparently he's been missing several

46:22.440 --> 46:24.209
hours already.
They can't find him Samuel!

46:24.210 --> 46:25.399
I'm coming home immediately.

46:25.400 --> 46:27.919
Keep off the phone, Miriam, in case
he's trying to call us.

46:27.920 --> 46:29.279
I'm sure he will try and ring us.

46:29.280 --> 46:33.159
If anyone else calls,
get them off the line at once!

46:33.160 --> 46:35.433
God. What's happened?

46:39.482 --> 46:40.413
Any news?

46:40.415 --> 46:42.719
No, I'll call you back Hilda,
I can't talk now.

46:42.720 --> 46:44.279
I'll phone you back!

46:44.280 --> 46:45.879
I told you to keep off the phone.

46:45.880 --> 46:48.279
Well, she just rung now -
I got rid of her as fast as I could,

46:48.280 --> 46:51.519
- I had to answer it, didn't I?
- Yes, of course.

46:51.520 --> 46:53.999
Did the school say what had
happened?

46:54.000 --> 46:55.519
Did he have a quarrel with someone?

46:55.520 --> 46:57.319
With another boy? With one of the
teachers?

46:57.320 --> 46:59.879
They didn't say what had happened,
except that he had run away.

46:59.880 --> 47:01.879
- And that he'd planned it.
- How do they know that?

47:01.880 --> 47:04.199
- He's taken all his money with him!
- All his money?

47:04.200 --> 47:06.959
Well, he doesn't have much,
so he can't have got far on that!

47:06.960 --> 47:10.039
This is all my fault. It's
because I've been involved with all

47:10.040 --> 47:12.639
this extra business at work -
and this is what happens!

47:12.640 --> 47:14.359
It's not your fault, Samuel.
How can it be?

47:14.360 --> 47:16.759
We must think where he's heading.

47:16.760 --> 47:18.399
Hannah, you think too.

47:18.400 --> 47:20.919
Where would Sasha go?
Where's his favourite place?

47:20.920 --> 47:23.279
Where would he try and reach
if he's not coming here?

47:23.280 --> 47:26.599
I don't know, Dad. I don't know what
his favourite places are.

47:26.600 --> 47:27.630
I wish I did!

47:27.631 --> 47:32.359
God, Samuel,
nothing will happen to him, will it?

47:43.080 --> 47:44.480
OK, got to go.

47:48.400 --> 47:51.310
Impatient little man, aren't we?

47:54.720 --> 47:56.319
Mrs Shaw?

47:56.320 --> 47:58.080
Sasha? Is that you?

47:59.112 --> 48:00.390
How's school?

48:00.392 --> 48:03.359
I'm not at school, Mrs Shaw,
I need to see you.

48:03.360 --> 48:05.479
What do you mean you're
not at school? Where are you?

48:05.480 --> 48:08.039
I'm in London, I have to see you.

48:08.040 --> 48:09.479
Why aren't you with your parents?

48:09.480 --> 48:11.519
You've not run away from school,
have you, Sasha?

48:11.520 --> 48:14.359
I want to see you, Mrs Shaw.
I have to tell you things.

48:14.360 --> 48:19.159
Where are you, Sasha? You have to
tell me exactly where you are.

48:19.160 --> 48:21.239
Cleveland Crescent, Paddington.

48:21.240 --> 48:24.679
You stay there now, Sasha,
and don't move, I will send

48:24.680 --> 48:27.999
the car for you, but it will
take about an hour to get to you.

48:28.000 --> 48:31.879
So, you must stay in that street
all the time, do you understand?

48:31.880 --> 48:33.359
Yes, I understand.

48:33.360 --> 48:35.399
You mustn't tell my parents,
Mrs Shaw.

48:35.400 --> 48:37.172
Well, of course I have
to tell your parents.

48:37.173 --> 48:37.880
Please don't.

48:37.881 --> 48:40.399
I won't stay here unless you
promise me that you won't.

48:40.400 --> 48:43.759
Sasha, you have to stay there.
That is the only thing that matters.

48:43.760 --> 48:45.839
Promise me you won't tell them.

48:45.840 --> 48:48.022
I'm sending the car now.

48:49.640 --> 48:50.840
Sasha?

48:52.040 --> 48:54.319
Sasha, are you still there?

48:54.320 --> 48:56.639
Sasha?

48:56.640 --> 48:58.559
Sasha!

48:58.560 --> 49:00.479
I was doing it all for you.

49:00.480 --> 49:02.879
I was looking for letters
from Anthony.

49:02.880 --> 49:05.639
Please don't tell my parents
until I am with you.

49:05.640 --> 49:07.039
Promise?

49:07.040 --> 49:08.519
OK, Sasha.

49:08.520 --> 49:10.759
I promise I won't tell your parents

49:10.760 --> 49:17.124
until we've had some time together,
but only if you stay where you are.

49:18.200 --> 49:19.480
Lawson.

49:21.560 --> 49:22.742
It's for you.

49:25.200 --> 49:26.599
Courtney, are you there?

49:26.600 --> 49:27.719
I am, Mr Samuel.

49:27.720 --> 49:30.079
I won't be joining
you for the final test.

49:30.080 --> 49:31.799
My son's gone missing from school.

49:31.800 --> 49:33.439
Gone missing? When did this happen?

49:33.440 --> 49:34.559
A few hours ago.

49:34.560 --> 49:35.799
I can't stay on the phone.

49:35.800 --> 49:37.919
Don't worry, we can manage here,
Mr Samuel.

49:37.920 --> 49:39.479
We'll be all set for the big day.

49:39.480 --> 49:42.599
Let me know when he's found, won't you?
Yes, yes.

49:42.600 --> 49:43.640
I must go.

49:45.040 --> 49:47.359
The boss's son has gone missing.

49:47.360 --> 49:48.519
He has?

49:48.520 --> 49:50.319
He should have a staff
locator like all of us

49:50.320 --> 49:52.839
- then we'd be able to find him!
- Exactly.

49:52.840 --> 49:55.659
Tomorrow is the start for that!

50:08.080 --> 50:09.639
What are you doing down there, love?

50:09.640 --> 50:11.519
I'm waiting. Somebody's coming.

50:11.520 --> 50:12.719
You're lost, are you?

50:12.720 --> 50:14.359
I'm not lost, a car is coming
for me.

50:14.360 --> 50:15.879
A car is coming?!

50:15.880 --> 50:17.759
What are you doing hiding down
there, then?

50:17.760 --> 50:19.639
You're going to come with me.
Yes, you are.

50:19.640 --> 50:22.822
I know what a child like you needs.

50:25.160 --> 50:27.524
No, you're coming with me!

51:15.960 --> 51:18.759
I had to do it, and you have to
understand,

51:18.760 --> 51:20.119
I had no choice.

51:20.120 --> 51:21.279
There you are, Sasha.

51:21.280 --> 51:22.839
We've been so worried.

51:22.840 --> 51:25.439
These police officers have
kindly stayed

51:25.440 --> 51:28.639
so that you will understand
the seriousness of what's happened.

51:28.640 --> 51:30.159
Of you running away.

51:30.160 --> 51:31.519
Come here, Sasha.

51:31.520 --> 51:32.799
Samuel.

51:32.800 --> 51:34.999
This is all because of me.

51:35.000 --> 51:38.559
Sasha was only trying to
help find Anthony.

51:38.560 --> 51:40.439
Thank you, Mrs Shaw.

51:40.440 --> 51:42.159
We will deal with this at home.

51:42.160 --> 51:44.079
All schools are beastly.

51:44.080 --> 51:46.039
None of them know how to behave.

51:46.040 --> 51:47.639
Don't let them send me back.

51:47.640 --> 51:48.680
Please!

52:33.480 --> 52:35.299
He won't forgive me.

52:36.640 --> 52:39.913
At least they've got their son back.

52:41.240 --> 52:44.399
We've heard the details of what
you've done from the school, Sasha.

52:44.400 --> 52:47.128
The situation is very serious.

52:47.800 --> 52:52.359
I don't want to go into it all now,
but it is extremely serious.

52:52.360 --> 52:54.479
Running away from school, Sasha.

52:54.480 --> 52:56.639
And getting into a stranger's car!

52:56.640 --> 52:59.359
Everything we've always
warned you about!

52:59.360 --> 53:01.919
We will leave all further discussion
until the morning.

53:01.920 --> 53:05.830
Hannah, will you take Sasha
upstairs to bed?

53:05.960 --> 53:09.870
We'll be along in a moment
to say goodnight.

53:16.000 --> 53:19.079
This is a reckoning, Miriam,
it really is.

53:19.080 --> 53:21.599
And now he will be expelled
from the school almost certainly,

53:21.600 --> 53:23.559
which will make it impossible for us
to get him

53:23.560 --> 53:26.015
into another good school...

53:26.840 --> 53:31.999
and all our plans for him, for his
future will be...

53:32.000 --> 53:34.273
He went to see her first.

53:34.720 --> 53:37.448
He went to see Mrs Shaw first.

53:39.200 --> 53:42.199
I have brought disgrace
on the family, haven't I?

53:42.200 --> 53:44.120
No, you haven't.

53:45.560 --> 53:47.679
Anyway, that makes two of us.

53:47.680 --> 53:49.639
I can't face going back.

53:49.640 --> 53:51.199
I'd rather die than go back.

53:51.200 --> 53:53.110
Don't talk like that.

53:53.640 --> 53:54.999
Never talk like that.

53:55.000 --> 53:57.279
I'm not going back, Hannah.

53:57.280 --> 53:58.320
We'll see.

53:59.680 --> 54:02.719
Anyway, who knows what's
going to happen.

54:02.720 --> 54:05.399
If there's a war, maybe every school
in the country will be closed,

54:05.400 --> 54:09.764
and we'll all be underground
together in bunkers.

54:12.640 --> 54:14.839
- Hello?
- Mr Samuel?

54:14.840 --> 54:17.679
I'm sorry to ring you at this hour,
but there's a problem.

54:17.680 --> 54:19.559
The whole system is suddenly
not working...

54:19.560 --> 54:21.879
The whole system?
How did that happened?

54:21.880 --> 54:25.839
We've been working on it for hours
now to get it back - and nothing.

54:25.840 --> 54:27.839
I felt you had to know.

54:27.840 --> 54:30.022
I'll come straight away.

54:31.400 --> 54:33.959
They want me to go to the airbase.
It's an emergency,

54:33.960 --> 54:35.559
because of tomorrow.

54:35.560 --> 54:37.759
Maybe I should stay here.

54:37.760 --> 54:39.159
Tonight of all nights.

54:39.160 --> 54:42.399
Well, both the children are here
and safe.

54:42.400 --> 54:44.199
So, if you really need to go.

54:44.200 --> 54:47.382
It's for the government, after all.

54:59.200 --> 55:00.382
Mr Petrukhin.

55:01.960 --> 55:05.279
Thank you for responding
to our emergency call.

55:05.280 --> 55:07.399
I didn't expect to see you here.

55:07.400 --> 55:10.159
Well, it is because of me that
your system is being installed here,

55:10.160 --> 55:12.799
so it better bloody work!

55:12.800 --> 55:15.959
We're keen not to look complete
idiots tomorrow.

55:15.960 --> 55:18.359
The transmitters are working fine.

55:18.360 --> 55:20.319
We're now getting
a signal near the buildings.

55:20.320 --> 55:21.957
But not out there.

55:31.280 --> 55:34.719
Nothing! It was working perfectly
well earlier on in the week.

55:34.720 --> 55:36.119
What on Earth could've happened?

55:36.120 --> 55:39.279
They are paging us all the time.
It should be bleeping.

55:39.280 --> 55:41.999
So, why do we have no signal?

55:42.000 --> 55:44.546
Go on, let's try further on.

55:50.080 --> 55:51.200
Stop!

55:56.520 --> 55:58.884
It is working, listen!

56:00.120 --> 56:02.211
Switch the engines off.

56:06.480 --> 56:08.919
Mr Field!

56:08.920 --> 56:10.439
There's a telephone call!

56:10.440 --> 56:12.119
It seems I was bleeping for real!

56:12.120 --> 56:14.399
Urgent telephone call, Mr Field!

56:14.400 --> 56:16.037
Somebody wants me.

56:16.760 --> 56:20.959
See, your system does work, after
all! You carry on.

56:20.960 --> 56:22.159
I'll catch you up.

56:22.160 --> 56:26.888
We'll have it working
again by the time you get back!

56:32.160 --> 56:34.706
This doesn't make any sense.

56:37.080 --> 56:39.279
His works, but we're getting
nothing.

56:39.280 --> 56:40.917
It doesn't add up!

56:45.040 --> 56:47.479
It'll work this time.

56:47.480 --> 56:51.079
Anyway, you know what they say,
last minute hitches means it goes

56:51.080 --> 56:55.626
all right on the day,
so there's hope for tomorrow!

56:57.600 --> 56:59.328
Get down! Get down!

57:02.480 --> 57:05.120
God! God!

57:13.240 --> 57:15.919
Get out, Mr Samuel! Get out!
