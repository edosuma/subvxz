PETER: Okay, Nick,

01:16.076 --> 01:18.286
we're getting
close to the end.

01:18.286 --> 01:20.413
But we're moving
into a new section now,

01:20.413 --> 01:23.083
what they call
sentence interpretation.

01:23.083 --> 01:25.419
Do you understand that?

01:26.419 --> 01:29.257
You know what interpreting
a sentence means?

01:31.257 --> 01:32.259
No.

01:33.259 --> 01:34.761
PETER: It's just a fancy word

01:34.761 --> 01:37.847
for telling what the words
mean to you.

01:37.847 --> 01:39.140
-Okay.
-Okay.

01:39.140 --> 01:40.308
And what these are,

01:40.308 --> 01:43.186
these are common expressions
that people

01:43.186 --> 01:44.604
sometimes say.

01:44.604 --> 01:46.356
You might hear it
out on the street,

01:46.356 --> 01:48.358
you might've seen it on TV,

01:48.358 --> 01:49.943
uh, maybe a friend,

01:49.943 --> 01:51.444
maybe your grandmother.

01:51.444 --> 01:53.697
So, I'm going to read you
a few of those, okay?

01:53.697 --> 01:55.281
-Okay.
-All right.

01:55.281 --> 01:56.533
Uh, the first one is,

01:56.533 --> 02:00.620
"Don't count your chickens
before they hatch."

02:00.620 --> 02:02.330
What does that mean to you,
that expression?

02:02.330 --> 02:05.792
"Don't count your chickens
before they hatch?"

02:05.792 --> 02:07.629
Don't count your chickens.

02:09.628 --> 02:10.633
Okay.

02:14.634 --> 02:16.469
What are you writing down?

02:16.469 --> 02:19.305
Well, the reason I'm asking
you the questions is

02:19.305 --> 02:20.348
because I'm supposed
to write...

02:20.348 --> 02:21.641
You know,
write down the answers...

02:21.641 --> 02:22.976
Yeah,
but that's what I'm saying.

02:22.976 --> 02:24.477
Why are you writing that down?

02:24.477 --> 02:26.354
So, in case I forget it later.

02:26.354 --> 02:27.814
But I don't like
people talking about me

02:27.814 --> 02:29.399
after I go places.

02:29.399 --> 02:31.317
I don't blame you. I'm not...
And I'm not talking about you.

02:31.317 --> 02:33.695
This is just for me.
These are my own notes.

02:33.695 --> 02:35.071
No one sees them but me.

02:35.071 --> 02:36.573
I don't like it, but...

02:36.573 --> 02:38.533
All right, here's another one.

02:38.533 --> 02:42.579
"It's the squeaky wheel
that gets the grease."

02:42.579 --> 02:45.047
What does that expression
mean to you?

02:52.047 --> 02:54.510
You ever heard that before?

02:57.510 --> 02:58.055
Nick?

03:00.055 --> 03:01.431
Okay, Nick, you know what?

03:01.431 --> 03:02.724
Why don't we skip this section

03:02.724 --> 03:03.933
and just move on
to the next one?

03:03.933 --> 03:06.186
It's actually more fun.
It's easier.

03:06.186 --> 03:07.604
It's called word comparisons.

03:07.604 --> 03:10.357
It's two words that
don't appear to be connected,

03:10.357 --> 03:12.859
and then you say what
you think when you hear

03:12.859 --> 03:14.903
the two words together. Okay?

03:14.903 --> 03:15.029
Okay.

03:16.029 --> 03:17.031
All right. First one is

03:18.031 --> 03:19.700
cat and mouse.

03:20.700 --> 03:23.119
What does that make you think?

03:23.119 --> 03:25.538
They don't like each other.

03:25.538 --> 03:27.457
That's right. They're kind of

03:27.457 --> 03:29.209
enemies against
each other, right?

03:29.209 --> 03:30.585
That's what I said.

03:30.585 --> 03:32.546
Okay, um...

03:33.546 --> 03:39.552
How about scissors
and a cooking pan?

03:39.552 --> 03:42.305
You can hurt yourself
with both.

03:42.305 --> 03:43.602
Okay.

03:47.602 --> 03:49.064
How about salt and water?

03:51.064 --> 03:52.732
The beach.

03:52.732 --> 03:53.817
The beach.

03:53.817 --> 03:55.991
That's a good answer.

04:01.991 --> 04:03.451
Um...

04:03.451 --> 04:04.744
Do you mind, could we go back

04:04.744 --> 04:06.746
to the scissors
and the cooking pan?

04:06.746 --> 04:07.415
Um...

04:08.415 --> 04:09.666
When you said
you can hurt yourself,

04:09.666 --> 04:11.126
what were you...
What did you mean?

04:11.126 --> 04:13.755
Do you ever think
about hurting yourself?

04:15.755 --> 04:19.259
Why did you think
of being hurt?

04:19.259 --> 04:21.012
Because I touched the pan,
and I hurt my hand.

04:22.012 --> 04:23.179
Oh, well,
that makes perfect sense.

04:23.179 --> 04:24.976
What happened?

04:27.976 --> 04:30.817
Do you remember when it was?

04:35.817 --> 04:38.488
Do you not want
to talk about this?

04:40.488 --> 04:42.615
I was sitting there
and trying to eat.

04:42.615 --> 04:44.951
And she started yelling at me,
and pushing me,

04:44.951 --> 04:46.995
and just telling me
I can't eat food.

04:46.995 --> 04:48.371
That was your grandmother
who was saying that?

04:48.371 --> 04:49.789
Yeah, and then
she threw stuff at me.

04:49.789 --> 04:50.041
-She threw things at you?
-Yeah.

04:51.041 --> 04:53.543
Then I picked up the pan,
and I threw it at her.

04:53.543 --> 04:55.462
You threw it
at your grandmother?

04:55.462 --> 04:56.713
I threw it at the wall.

04:56.713 --> 04:59.222
Oh, you weren't trying
to hit your grandmother?

05:06.222 --> 05:08.812
Did you burn yourself
when you threw the pan?

05:12.812 --> 05:13.523

05:15.523 --> 05:16.318
(SOBBING SOFTLY)

49:38.228 --> 49:40.355

inside his home.

One of my cousin's
friends, Tiara,

49:44.984 --> 49:46.736
she has this dog.

49:46.736 --> 49:48.238
His name is Blade.

He's a Great Dane.
Oh, my gosh!

Authorities are still
searching for

50:07.382 --> 50:08.925
Constantine Nikas,

50:08.925 --> 50:10.260
suspected of carrying
out the robbery

50:10.260 --> 50:11.886
along with his brother.

Nikolas Nikas was arrested
near the scene

after crashing through
a plate-glass window

50:15.682 --> 50:17.892

relationship with
her grandsons.

50:30.363 --> 50:31.865
She took out
a restraining order

50:31.865 --> 50:33.034
against Constantine
earlier this year,

50:34.034 --> 50:36.703
after she says he threatened
and stalked her.

50:36.703 --> 50:39.122
And she blames him for
an altercation with Nikolas

50:39.122 --> 50:40.041
that left her
with a broken arm.

50:41.041 --> 50:43.251
I don't want to call him.

50:43.251 --> 50:45.045
I don't want to talk with him.

50:45.045 --> 50:46.546
I don't want to, uh...

50:46.546 --> 50:49.424
All because he treats
his brother so badly.

of sheets off the top,

have some money

01:00:07.774 --> 01:00:09.444
(LAUGHING)

01:00:11.444 --> 01:00:12.696
RAY: So I ride with him
to Long Island,

01:00:12.696 --> 01:00:13.822
and I'm thinking
the whole time

01:00:13.822 --> 01:00:16.366
this PO's gonna
read me the riot act,

01:00:16.366 --> 01:00:19.285
'cause I'm fucking up already,
but, I mean...

01:00:19.285 --> 01:00:20.704
I'm feeling so great,
and I'm fucked up.

01:00:20.704 --> 01:00:23.123
And I just don't give a fuck.
I'm celebrating.

01:00:23.123 --> 01:00:24.457
I'm not gonna spill it.

01:00:24.457 --> 01:00:26.334
Yo, how much
is this shit worth?

01:00:26.334 --> 01:00:28.837
So I'm at the arcade
with Trevor now.

01:00:28.837 --> 01:00:31.172
You know, we're doing
our thing, hustling acid.

01:00:31.172 --> 01:00:32.841
And, you know,
we take over this place.

01:00:32.841 --> 01:00:34.843
Like it's our fucking office.

01:00:34.843 --> 01:00:37.052
Once in a while
someone will show up

01:00:37.052 --> 01:00:38.638
and we'll make a sale,
you know.

01:00:38.638 --> 01:00:40.557
Make a sale here.
Make a sale there.

01:00:40.557 --> 01:00:42.392
CUSTOMER: Twenty? You know...

01:00:42.392 --> 01:00:44.144
TREVOR: Take that shit
and get high, baby boy.

01:00:44.144 --> 01:00:46.312
A little stronger
than last time, I hope.

01:00:46.312 --> 01:00:47.023
RAY: But then,
one of Trevor's friends,

01:00:48.023 --> 01:00:49.567
this clown Donnie walks in.

01:00:50.567 --> 01:00:51.818
And he's all fucked up.

01:00:51.818 --> 01:00:53.236
And he's talking about

01:00:53.236 --> 01:00:56.531
how he just robbed some
Radio Shack down the street.

01:00:56.531 --> 01:00:58.324
Look, check this out.

01:00:58.324 --> 01:00:59.325
RAY: At this point,

01:00:59.325 --> 01:01:00.702
the acid's kicking in for me,

01:01:00.702 --> 01:01:04.998
so I can't follow this shit.
I'm having a hard time

01:01:04.998 --> 01:01:06.708
following the story,

01:01:06.708 --> 01:01:08.209
and I'm starting
to freak out a little bit.

01:01:08.209 --> 01:01:09.711
Bam! Right over
his fucking head.

01:01:09.711 --> 01:01:12.422
And then, guess what happens?
The fucking cops show up.

01:01:12.422 --> 01:01:13.673
And the next thing I know,

01:01:13.673 --> 01:01:15.508
Trevor's grabbing me,
and we just book it into

01:01:15.508 --> 01:01:16.676
the parking lot.

01:01:16.676 --> 01:01:17.927
And I just remember thinking
I could run

01:01:17.927 --> 01:01:19.846
for, like, 20 miles straight.

01:01:19.846 --> 01:01:20.515
TREVOR: It's here, right here.

01:01:22.515 --> 01:01:25.268
RAY: So I'm following Trevor,
and it's fucking freezing.

01:01:25.268 --> 01:01:26.519
He leads us
into Adventureland,

01:01:26.519 --> 01:01:27.021
this amusement park.

01:01:28.021 --> 01:01:31.691
At this point, I have no idea
what the fuck is going on.

01:01:31.691 --> 01:01:33.360
And then Donnie leads us
into this ride,

01:01:33.360 --> 01:01:34.944
and they look for a place
to hide their shit.

01:01:34.944 --> 01:01:36.196
But it's fuckin'
dark in there.

01:01:36.196 --> 01:01:37.614
I can't see shit.

01:01:37.614 --> 01:01:39.532
All of a sudden,
they get bagged,

01:01:39.532 --> 01:01:41.201
I'm all by myself in the dark.

01:01:41.201 --> 01:01:43.078
And literally
the next thing I remember is,

01:01:43.078 --> 01:01:46.873
I'm fucking running down
some random street.

01:01:46.873 --> 01:01:49.209
And I just see a fucking cab.

01:01:49.209 --> 01:01:51.378
And I hail it,
and I just get in.

01:01:51.378 --> 01:01:53.630
And this driver,
he just kept talking to me

01:01:53.630 --> 01:01:56.216
and talking to me, and
I'm fucking tripping balls.

01:01:56.216 --> 01:01:57.884
And I'm telling him,
"Please, please.

01:01:57.884 --> 01:01:58.718
"Just give me
some peace and quiet,

01:01:58.718 --> 01:02:00.220
"or I'm going to throw up."

01:02:00.220 --> 01:02:02.430
If you're going to throw up,
you give me my money right now

01:02:02.430 --> 01:02:03.890
and you get out of this car.

01:02:03.890 --> 01:02:05.099
RAY: And I told the driver,

01:02:05.099 --> 01:02:06.893
"Don't worry.
I'm going to go in the house,

01:02:06.893 --> 01:02:08.395
"I'll get the money
from my bag."

01:02:08.395 --> 01:02:10.438
I just got out of jail today,
man. I don't have shit.

01:02:10.438 --> 01:02:13.900
As soon as he hears the word
"jail," he fuckin' freaks.

01:02:13.900 --> 01:02:15.276
Talking about, "Oh,
I'm not getting ripped off

01:02:15.276 --> 01:02:16.778
"by one of you punks again."

01:02:16.778 --> 01:02:18.988
-I am not getting fucked over!
-RAY: And he just fucking

01:02:18.988 --> 01:02:20.407
steps on the gas,

01:02:20.407 --> 01:02:22.575
and that was it.
He just takes off.

01:02:22.575 --> 01:02:24.828
I'm gonna pay you. My mother's
gonna pay you. She has money.

01:02:24.828 --> 01:02:26.246
I'm going to the police, okay!

01:02:26.246 --> 01:02:29.457
RAY: Man, I heard the word
"cops," and I lose it.

01:02:29.457 --> 01:02:31.292
I gotta get
the fuck out of here.

01:02:31.292 --> 01:02:33.085
-Pull over. Fuck this.
-You are crazy!

01:02:33.085 --> 01:02:34.838
RAY: I'm not going
back to jail, man.

01:02:34.838 --> 01:02:37.757
I'm not going back to jail.
God damn it!

01:02:37.757 --> 01:02:38.925
So I happen to get
one of the doors opened

01:02:38.925 --> 01:02:40.510
before he locked them all.

01:02:40.510 --> 01:02:42.303
This guy's crazy.
He's fucking driving.

01:02:42.303 --> 01:02:44.097
He's speeding down the road,

01:02:44.097 --> 01:02:46.307
30, 40 miles an hour.

01:02:46.307 --> 01:02:47.600
And I know we're getting

01:02:47.600 --> 01:02:48.977
closer and closer
to the precinct.

01:02:48.977 --> 01:02:51.104
I know where my local
precinct is. It's not far.

01:02:51.104 --> 01:02:53.523
And I am not
going back to jail.

01:02:53.523 --> 01:02:56.945
So I just looked down at
the pavement and just jump.

01:02:58.945 --> 01:03:00.655
And now look
at my fucking face!

01:03:00.655 --> 01:03:03.993
I can't go walk around
looking like this.

01:03:04.993 --> 01:03:07.665
Yo. Yo, you listening to me?

01:03:10.665 --> 01:03:12.960
Yo, you fucking hear me?

01:03:13.960 --> 01:03:14.838
Yo.

01:03:16.838 --> 01:03:19.800

01:03:20.800 --> 01:03:21.970

01:03:25.638 --> 01:03:27.182
I'm gonna drive us
out there right now,

01:03:27.182 --> 01:03:28.975
gonna go through the ride,
and we split what we find.

01:03:28.975 --> 01:03:29.018
All right?

01:03:30.018 --> 01:03:31.478
What, to Adventurers?
Right now?

01:03:31.478 --> 01:03:32.982
Yes.

01:03:35.982 --> 01:03:37.484
Are you fucking serious?

01:03:37.484 --> 01:03:39.903
I should be in a fucking bed
somewhere right now.

01:03:39.903 --> 01:03:42.489
You have nowhere to go.
You have no plan.

01:03:42.489 --> 01:03:44.325

when we drove past?

01:03:57.504 --> 01:03:59.088
Yeah, the police?

01:03:59.088 --> 01:04:00.340
Yeah. So I called over there,

and there's been
a police incident.

01:04:02.509 --> 01:04:04.678
They're not going to discharge
anyone for an hour and a half.

01:04:04.678 --> 01:04:06.346
So what's going to happen
with your brother?

01:04:06.346 --> 01:04:07.014
I don't know.
It's fuckin' nightmare.

01:04:08.014 --> 01:04:09.349
I'm kinda fucked.

01:04:09.349 --> 01:04:10.934
So I want to drop him off
back at home,

01:04:10.934 --> 01:04:12.896
then come back
to the hospital afterwards.

01:04:14.896 --> 01:04:16.192
So I'm gonna drop you off
back at home, right?

01:04:19.192 --> 01:04:20.861
Yeah, yeah, that sounds good.

01:04:21.861 --> 01:04:23.866
Yeah, drive me home.

Just pull up
around back right here.

Right here?

01:05:18.126 --> 01:05:19.085
RAY: Yeah, just pull up
around back.

01:05:19.085 --> 01:05:20.420
I don't want to go
around front

01:05:20.420 --> 01:05:22.172
because then the dogs
are going to start barking

01:05:22.172 --> 01:05:23.681
and wake everybody up
and stuff. So...

01:05:31.681 --> 01:05:34.688

I need to talk to her.

(SIGHS)

01:05:52.202 --> 01:05:53.036

very important is happening,

and it's deeply connected
to my purpose.

01:05:56.873 --> 01:05:59.878
you are somehow
connected to it as well.

Or do I just sound
like a total faggot?

No, I feel you. I understand.

in that guy's house.

again in a minute.
