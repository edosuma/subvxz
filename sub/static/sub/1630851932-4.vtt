00:07.680 --> 00:08.800
I need to see you.

00:08.920 --> 00:10.320
Why? Are you gonna pay me my money?

00:10.440 --> 00:11.880
I want you to take
some deep breaths.

00:12.000 --> 00:15.000
I refuse to continue until you pay me
the Â£50,000 you owe me.

00:15.120 --> 00:16.120
If he dies...

00:16.240 --> 00:18.560
If he dies, you need to think
about your son.

00:18.680 --> 00:19.680
Done.

00:19.800 --> 00:23.080
He's been suspended from duties.
He is not allowed to carry out surgeries.

00:23.200 --> 00:25.760
- He's lying to me again.
- Can I show you something?

00:25.880 --> 00:28.440
I was here. I remember.

00:28.680 --> 00:31.360
I'd like to start to work again
on the Lancaster treatments.

00:31.480 --> 00:34.000
- Have you got your own clinic?
- Of sorts, yes.

00:34.480 --> 00:36.800
You'll just need to blindfold them
on the way in.

00:37.120 --> 00:38.760
What's she doing here?

00:38.880 --> 00:40.280
-I can explain.
-Explain what?

00:40.400 --> 00:41.640
You said
you told me everything.

00:41.760 --> 00:45.360
This surgeon could be the link to an
undetected network of serious criminals.

00:45.520 --> 00:48.120
- You think I should take this upstairs?
- No, I think we keep this in the family.

00:48.240 --> 00:51.600
I'm done with this marriage. It's over.
I need to look after Eve.

00:51.880 --> 00:54.680
- And make sure you look after Suzana.
- Oh, shit.

01:00.360 --> 01:01.720
Someone's coming.

02:31.280 --> 02:36.760
Lord God Almighty,
have mercy on your servant Suzana.

02:37.920 --> 02:42.640
O Lord Almighty, God Amlighty,

02:43.720 --> 02:46.720
carry Suzana's soul to the heavens.

02:47.600 --> 02:51.880
Lord Almighty, God Almighty,

02:52.880 --> 02:56.760
Your servant Suzana
is headed towards your kingdom.

02:57.640 --> 03:02.160
Have mercy, Lord, on Suzana,
your servant in eternity.

03:03.040 --> 03:06.040
Have mercy on your servant Suzana.

03:22.840 --> 03:26.960
TEMPLE

04:25.040 --> 04:26.240
Hello.

04:27.640 --> 04:28.680
Hello.

04:29.400 --> 04:32.160
I'm Daniel. Daniel Milton.

04:36.560 --> 04:37.720
The doctor.

04:37.880 --> 04:41.400
- Yes.
- I am Max, Suzana's brother.

04:42.920 --> 04:44.080
I'm very sorry.

04:44.200 --> 04:46.760
Suzana...
She spoke very warmly of you.

04:48.320 --> 04:50.920
She said you were always
looking out for her.

04:51.560 --> 04:52.560
Well, I...

04:52.680 --> 04:56.640
No, she was grateful, for the risk
you took in trying to help her.

04:59.200 --> 05:00.840
I wish
I could've done more.

05:01.480 --> 05:03.200
She was so scared and...

05:04.680 --> 05:07.840
And you, you gave her hope.

05:12.120 --> 05:14.800
I must be going.
I don't want to impose.

05:14.920 --> 05:18.440
On the contrary.
It's an honor to have you here, doctor.

05:21.280 --> 05:23.280
Suzana would've been thrilled.

05:23.960 --> 05:25.200
You're very kind.

05:25.400 --> 05:28.720
Please, as my guest,
come to the wake and honor my sister.

05:32.040 --> 05:33.880
I would love that,
but I have to get back to work.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.920
No, no, you will come.

06:13.200 --> 06:14.920
- Everyone okay?
- Yeah.

06:15.520 --> 06:18.160
- Yeah, there's a step.
- There you go.

06:19.000 --> 06:23.240
Just stand there. Come on, Dennis,
if you would grab my arm.

06:23.360 --> 06:26.080
You'll be fine. We have to trust Anna.

06:27.080 --> 06:29.640
There we go. That's it.

06:30.360 --> 06:31.640
Okay.

06:32.480 --> 06:35.000
- You'll be fine, it's not far.
- Everyone okay?

06:35.120 --> 06:36.240
Yeah.

06:45.920 --> 06:47.560
Welcome to the clinic.

06:50.120 --> 06:54.600
We were expecting, you know,
an actual clinic-clinic.

06:54.840 --> 06:59.800
Yeah, I know. It's not your conventional,
all white, clean looking clinic, no.

06:59.920 --> 07:01.880
- Magazines and comfy chairs.
- No.

07:02.680 --> 07:05.720
But how many have you seen since
you've been diagnosed?

07:06.120 --> 07:08.000
- A few.
A-  lot.

07:08.120 --> 07:11.160
And how many of those do you think
were actually trying to cure you?

07:11.320 --> 07:13.040
- None.
- Okay, fair point.

07:13.160 --> 07:16.680
This is where my miracle happened.
And where yours will, too.

07:17.000 --> 07:19.480
Just make yourselves at home.
We're going to wait for Daniel,

07:19.600 --> 07:21.840
and then when he's here,
we can start straight away.

07:32.960 --> 07:38.960
Welcome, everybody. I want to very
much thank you all for coming here

07:39.160 --> 07:42.120
to celebrate the life of my
beautiful sister, Zana.

07:42.960 --> 07:45.400
I for one cannot see
life without Zana.

07:45.680 --> 07:49.320
Always has just been the two of us.
And she was a very special...

07:50.080 --> 07:53.200
very, very special human being.
As you know.

07:55.400 --> 07:56.640
Let's drink.

07:57.240 --> 07:58.920
May God forgive her.

08:10.880 --> 08:13.560
Zana was such a kind,
thoughtful and caring person

08:13.680 --> 08:15.400
and the world is a sadder place without
her.

08:16.400 --> 08:18.080
We will never forget her.

08:18.880 --> 08:21.120
Daniel, where are you?
I mean, we're ready to go.

08:21.240 --> 08:24.880
I can't keep them waiting any longer.
Can you please call me back?

08:27.800 --> 08:29.080
What's going on?

08:30.120 --> 08:33.760
I was just grabbing this heater,

08:34.280 --> 08:37.120
as you can see, this place is a nightmare
to heat up.

08:37.480 --> 08:39.800
I didn't want you to be cold
because it's pretty chilly in there.

08:39.920 --> 08:41.440
- Where's Daniel?
- Daniel?

08:42.520 --> 08:45.880
- I knew I couldn't trust him.
- No, you can trust him.

08:46.000 --> 08:48.960
It's just, you know, there's just...
Something must have come up.

08:49.080 --> 08:51.120
Something more
important than this?

08:51.480 --> 08:55.160
He must be doing
an emergency surgery or something.

08:57.320 --> 09:00.960
- So is this happening or not?
- Look, I can't do this by myself.

09:01.120 --> 09:02.480
Okay, so no.

09:03.080 --> 09:05.680
No. What? He'll be here.

09:05.800 --> 09:08.120
It's just that we need to wait
a little bit longer.

09:08.240 --> 09:09.560
Can't you do it without him?

09:09.680 --> 09:12.400
- What? No, no.
- You're the scientist, right?

09:12.520 --> 09:14.400
You are the brains behind it.

09:15.280 --> 09:17.600
You were the one
who worked for Faxol.

09:18.480 --> 09:22.720
He just, what, oversaw basic medical
stuff, temperatures, obs,

09:22.840 --> 09:24.200
which you could easily do.

09:24.320 --> 09:25.320
No.

09:25.560 --> 09:27.240
So why are we waiting for him?

09:27.600 --> 09:29.880
You don't need a man by your side
to do this.

09:30.400 --> 09:32.360
You're the one with the knowledge.

09:32.520 --> 09:33.600
I suppose.

09:36.120 --> 09:39.680
I have done thousands of injections...

09:40.720 --> 09:41.720
on rats.

09:41.840 --> 09:45.320
Exactly. And rats move.
Humans stay still.

09:45.440 --> 09:47.520
It will be way easier.
Come on, let's do it.

09:47.640 --> 09:49.520
But will they trust me, though?

09:50.400 --> 09:55.640
Anna. We have a terminal illness.
Just remind them that you did too.

10:11.200 --> 10:13.280
We've got three more barrels coming in
for the front, okay?

10:13.400 --> 10:15.760
Make sure everyone
keeps clear of the road.

10:17.360 --> 10:19.440
- Can I help you?
- Yeah. Sorry.

10:21.000 --> 10:23.800
Excuse me. Is this the main point
for the protest?

10:23.920 --> 10:25.960
Better hope so.
You ready to get painted?

10:26.080 --> 10:28.080
- What?
- Painted.

10:28.200 --> 10:29.200
No, no.

10:29.320 --> 10:30.760
I got another one for you, Jess.
One more.

10:30.920 --> 10:32.320
Lee. Hey.

10:32.840 --> 10:33.840
- Eve.
- You okay?

10:33.960 --> 10:36.840
- Yeah. Think so.
- Yeah. Do you need a boiler suit?

10:38.280 --> 10:39.840
- Sorry?
- Boiler suit?

10:40.000 --> 10:43.280
- We're all wearing them.
- Ready to get some tears painted?

10:45.400 --> 10:47.080
-Oh, no, no, no.
-Come on, I'm doing everyone.

10:47.200 --> 10:48.200
Yeah, come on.
You'll look brilliant.

10:48.320 --> 10:49.680
- I'll do you next.
- Really?

10:50.640 --> 10:52.280
- Okay.
- Let's go.

10:53.600 --> 10:55.920
Daniel, where are you?
We're ready to go.

10:56.040 --> 10:59.040
I can't keep them waiting any longer.
Can you please call me back?

10:59.920 --> 11:02.440
Hey, Doctor.
Why are you not eating anything?

11:02.880 --> 11:05.360
-  Another drink, Doctor?
-  Oh, no, thank you.

11:05.480 --> 11:08.280
-  I really have to get going.
-  What are you talking about?

11:08.720 --> 11:10.600
In this hall,
you are in Moldova,

11:10.720 --> 11:15.120
and in Moldova we have the highest level
of alcohol drinking in the whole world.

11:15.280 --> 11:18.000
You are not drinking in Moldova,
people think you're strange.

11:18.120 --> 11:20.640
They think maybe
you have something to hide.

11:23.280 --> 11:25.360
You have something
to hide, Daniel?

11:26.960 --> 11:28.160
No.

11:28.600 --> 11:29.960
So, drink.

11:36.400 --> 11:38.000
Means good luck.

11:45.720 --> 11:48.400
Good?
Strong, but you get used to it.

11:48.760 --> 11:50.360
Please come
sit with me.

11:51.240 --> 11:52.680
Okay?

11:53.680 --> 11:55.080
Okay.

11:56.760 --> 11:59.040
There we go.

12:06.400 --> 12:10.840
- Are we not gonna wait for the doctor?
- No. We won't need him for this part.

12:11.000 --> 12:15.320
All we need is Anna. She's our living
proof this treatment works, right?

12:15.480 --> 12:17.480
- Right.
- Will we feel any side effects?

12:18.280 --> 12:22.120
Just some, maybe some mild
palpitations or nausea,

12:22.240 --> 12:23.640
but nothing major at all.

12:23.800 --> 12:25.600
We can deal with that,
can't we?

12:25.960 --> 12:29.200
Okay, so this is the treatment.

12:42.040 --> 12:43.640
This is the treatment.

12:47.560 --> 12:51.840
I've been thinking lately
about this old Moldovan story.

12:54.160 --> 12:55.680
Folklore.

12:56.760 --> 12:57.960
Folklore?

12:59.560 --> 13:01.560
- Folklore. Yes.
- Folklore.

13:04.160 --> 13:06.560
They say a kind shepherd
hears from his favorite sheep

13:06.680 --> 13:10.520
that other shepherds from other fields
plan to murder him and steal his flock.

13:10.640 --> 13:11.640
Really?

13:11.760 --> 13:17.000
He knows that whatever he does,
that fate is going to catch up with him

13:17.120 --> 13:19.200
and there is nothing he can do.

13:25.480 --> 13:28.920
- So what does he do?
- You're asking me?

13:29.040 --> 13:32.480
- I don't know.
- Guess.

13:32.560 --> 13:34.280
- Come on. Just...
- I don't know.

13:34.400 --> 13:36.480
He kills the other shepherds
before they kill him.

13:36.600 --> 13:41.120
No, no, my God.
I just said he's a kind shepherd.

13:41.760 --> 13:43.920
Don't you remember a folktale,
kind shepherd.

13:44.040 --> 13:45.120
Okay.

13:45.680 --> 13:49.680
What he does is he's...
He tells the sheep to tell his mother

13:49.800 --> 13:52.760
that he got married
to a beautiful woman and he's gone.

13:53.400 --> 13:55.480
And instead of trying to escape,

13:56.120 --> 13:58.040
he embraces his own death.

13:59.880 --> 14:01.440
He finds peace.

14:02.800 --> 14:04.760
And prepares to die...

14:05.440 --> 14:06.960
with honor.

14:22.480 --> 14:23.800
Hi, Jamie.

14:24.400 --> 14:25.680
I'm Kam.

14:28.400 --> 14:31.480
- How are you?
- I'm very well.

14:32.760 --> 14:34.120
How are you?

14:35.360 --> 14:39.480
- Yeah, we're good. Aren't we?
- Great. Yeah.

14:40.520 --> 14:41.760
So you're back?

14:41.960 --> 14:45.400
Yeah, I'm... we'd like to ask you
some more questions.

14:45.520 --> 14:48.320
- More questions?
- More specific ones.

14:50.160 --> 14:52.120
All right. Okay.

14:56.840 --> 14:59.440
What do you know
about Daniel Milton?

15:00.040 --> 15:01.760
- Is he a friend of Anna's?
- Who's Anna?

15:01.880 --> 15:06.120
- Come on. You know who Anna is.
- No, I don't.

15:06.240 --> 15:08.200
Of course you do.
Anna from Holland.

15:08.320 --> 15:11.560
- Your friend and Daniel Milton's friend.
- Tell us about your other friends, Jamie.

15:11.680 --> 15:14.640
We heard you and your friends are
working for some serious criminals.

15:14.800 --> 15:17.120
- What? No, we're not.
- Come on.

15:17.680 --> 15:20.200
You're in here, wasting your life away.
They're out there.

15:20.320 --> 15:22.400
I'm in here because of what happened
with the police officer.

15:22.520 --> 15:25.040
And how many people have they killed?
These friends of yours.

15:25.200 --> 15:27.320
None! No, none!

15:27.440 --> 15:29.680
- And they're not...
- Not what? Not your friends?

15:29.800 --> 15:31.520
- Killers, they're not killers.
- But they are your friends.

15:31.640 --> 15:33.080
Daniel Milton.
He's a killer, is he?

15:33.200 --> 15:35.560
- No! Daniel was Lee's doctor...
- Lee?

15:38.120 --> 15:39.520
Right.

15:42.640 --> 15:44.280
Is this Lee?

15:55.080 --> 15:58.600
Any of this actually raises awareness
or creates change?

16:00.240 --> 16:03.440
Raise awareness? Yeah.
Creates change? No.

16:07.560 --> 16:12.600
People don't realize it's real until they
plug their mobiles in and have no power.

16:13.000 --> 16:17.000
And when they can't buy their
favorite foods, and fill up their cars...

16:17.400 --> 16:20.000
- It'll be too late then.
- Depressing, right?

16:21.160 --> 16:23.760
Look, this won't even make
the 10 o'clock news.

16:24.720 --> 16:28.280
Shouldn't we be doing stuff
that will make the news, then?

16:29.480 --> 16:31.520
That's what we really want.

16:41.120 --> 16:43.680
It's 1940's. Reinforced.

16:43.800 --> 16:47.480
This door is four inches thick.
Five foot concrete roof.

16:47.680 --> 16:50.760
- What are you doing?
- The guys just wanted a quick tour.

16:51.640 --> 16:53.520
This is a really high-tech shelter.

16:54.040 --> 16:57.360
For its time, I mean.
This door's four inches thick.

16:57.720 --> 16:59.640
Churchill could have
stayed here during the war.

16:59.760 --> 17:01.200
Can we go now?
I'm not feeling too good.

17:01.320 --> 17:03.360
- No, I think you should rest...
- Churchill didn't like Neasden.

17:03.480 --> 17:04.840
- He said it was damp.
- Right.

17:05.000 --> 17:07.600
- Let's have a rest in the ward.
- He liked his comforts.

17:07.720 --> 17:09.120
- Really?
- Yes.

17:10.000 --> 17:12.960
- You okay?
- Not really.

17:27.400 --> 17:28.920
Daniel, come on!

17:30.160 --> 17:32.640
Come on, Daniel!
Dance for Zana!

17:34.960 --> 17:36.960
This is Suzana's favorite song.

17:42.160 --> 17:44.920
Come on!
Daniel, come on!

18:00.600 --> 18:02.920
Go, Daniel! Come on!

18:23.080 --> 18:25.200
Come on, Daniel!
Dance for Zana!

18:32.120 --> 18:36.760
Everyone! This is the doctor!
This is the doctor who helped my sister!

18:48.720 --> 18:50.320
Come on!

18:53.680 --> 18:55.360
Come on, Doctor!

19:12.160 --> 19:13.320
Don't touch her!

19:13.440 --> 19:16.640
Believe me, mate, it's the last thing I
want to do, but unless she moves...

19:17.280 --> 19:20.600
- I said leave her, you prick!
- Go on, get her up.

19:21.160 --> 19:22.240
Fuck!

19:22.360 --> 19:24.240
Let's stick to hugging trees
in the future, yes?

19:24.360 --> 19:25.760
- Sorry?
- You heard me.

19:25.880 --> 19:27.080
Hugging trees?

19:27.880 --> 19:30.680
You're not doing yourselves any favors,
you're just pissing everybody off.

19:30.800 --> 19:32.680
That's the point, mate.

19:33.520 --> 19:35.080
Patronizing twat.

19:35.960 --> 19:37.600
Beg your pardon?

19:38.680 --> 19:40.360
You look like that
and you're calling me a twat?

19:40.480 --> 19:41.600
Oh, correct.

19:41.920 --> 19:45.080
- I'd be very careful, if I was you.
- I should be careful?

19:45.640 --> 19:48.000
I'm not the one treating
environmental collapse as a joke.

19:48.160 --> 19:51.720
- Okay, Just go home, mate.
- No, no, I want an apology.

19:51.840 --> 19:53.280
- You what?
- Yeah.

19:54.480 --> 19:55.960
- Apologize.
- Lee. Leave it.

19:56.080 --> 19:58.800
- You made your point, yeah?
- No, no, no. Come on.

19:59.480 --> 20:02.400
- Apologize for what?
- For calling us tree-huggers.

20:02.760 --> 20:05.560
- For being ignorant.
- So now you're calling me ignorant.

20:05.680 --> 20:07.280
Yeah. Yeah, I am.

20:07.600 --> 20:09.800
A rude, ignorant...

20:12.480 --> 20:13.600
fuck.

20:13.720 --> 20:17.320
- All right, I'm arresting you.
- Fuck off! Get the fuck off of me!

20:17.440 --> 20:21.320
Fuck you, man! Fuck you! Fuck off!
Fuckin' hell, not my arm!

20:49.800 --> 20:51.400
What's happening?

20:55.320 --> 20:57.760
She didn't take you
for a bad man, Daniel.

20:58.880 --> 21:00.520
She trusted you.

21:02.120 --> 21:04.360
But you're a bad man,
aren't you?

21:06.120 --> 21:08.760
- What do you mean?
- Oh, please.

21:12.160 --> 21:13.800
Do not lie.

21:15.920 --> 21:17.520
Not today.

21:20.280 --> 21:22.120
How did you find out?

21:27.840 --> 21:31.600
I was at the house when you came.
I saw you running away.

21:33.440 --> 21:34.640
Suzana had called me the day before

21:34.760 --> 21:38.400
and said she was coming into some
money, but wouldn't tell me how.

21:42.600 --> 21:44.600
She wanted to help me.

21:47.800 --> 21:49.520
I know what she did.

21:53.680 --> 21:57.680
She sold her kidney and convinced you
to do the surgery, am I right?

22:02.760 --> 22:06.520
You were bringing her the money
and found her dead, so you kept it.

22:10.280 --> 22:14.240
How could you let her convince you of
such a thing? We should sue you!

22:16.800 --> 22:18.320
Did she beg you?

22:21.200 --> 22:24.000
She, she...

22:41.080 --> 22:42.760
God, it's my fault.

22:45.440 --> 22:47.000
It's my fault.

22:48.760 --> 22:51.120
She knew of my debt
and wanted to help.

22:52.560 --> 22:55.000
It was my debt
that cost my sister her life.

22:58.040 --> 23:02.000
I don't deserve this filthy money,
but I have no choice.

23:03.000 --> 23:06.600
The people I owe money to,
you understand? It's not a bank.

23:12.440 --> 23:14.320
This is my lousy excuse.

23:17.480 --> 23:18.920
What is yours?

23:22.440 --> 23:24.360
I don't have one.

23:34.080 --> 23:35.560
Where's the money?

23:43.320 --> 23:45.360
- I don't feel too clever.
- Yeah, me neither.

23:45.480 --> 23:48.800
- I don't feel too clever at all.
- Daniel, why aren't you picking up?

23:49.520 --> 23:51.440
There's a guy here
that has a temperature of 39!

23:51.560 --> 23:53.680
The others are getting fucking sick.
I don't know what to do.

23:53.800 --> 23:55.840
I think we really need to get Dennis
out of here.

23:55.960 --> 23:58.280
What? No. No, no, no. I need more time.

23:59.520 --> 24:01.960
Sorry. Sorry, sorry, sorry.

24:02.320 --> 24:04.760
I just, obviously,
I want this to work for you all.

24:05.040 --> 24:07.160
And you said you'd be fine
with all the side-effects.

24:07.280 --> 24:10.160
- You said they'd be mild.
- They'll subside.

24:10.720 --> 24:11.920
When?

24:12.320 --> 24:14.720
- Soon. I promise.
- How long?

24:15.480 --> 24:19.000
I just need to do a few more tests,
and I can only do them if you stay.

24:19.120 --> 24:21.480
- So, please.
- How long?

24:21.720 --> 24:23.600
Just one more hour.

24:24.240 --> 24:26.920
- One more hour?
- One hour, tops.

24:29.240 --> 24:32.120
- Okay.
- Thank you.

24:38.920 --> 24:41.000
- Have you thought of the obvious?
- What's the obvious?

24:41.120 --> 24:43.120
Well, that he's known to us.

24:43.440 --> 24:46.640
Without an address, there'll be hundreds
of Lee Simmons on our books.

24:46.760 --> 24:49.280
So you haven't checked.

24:52.400 --> 24:55.400
Lee Simmons. Criminal.
Did you... did you really just type that?

24:55.520 --> 24:57.720
If we can get a photo of him,
we can link it.

24:57.840 --> 24:59.840
Not even embarrassed.

25:04.800 --> 25:06.800
Hello? Yes.
Kam here from CID.

25:07.000 --> 25:09.320
Yeah. I need you to run
a name check for me, please.

25:09.440 --> 25:11.680
Lee Simmons, London area.

25:13.360 --> 25:15.960
No, Kim, I'm definitely
not embarrassed.

25:16.080 --> 25:18.320
Arrested? Really?

25:19.440 --> 25:22.240
- Where?
- Put the phone down.

25:24.520 --> 25:29.360
He works for a company called CTIP.
City Transport Infrastructure Protection.

25:29.920 --> 25:33.240
They work on drainage,
and infrastructure under London.

25:35.040 --> 25:36.680
Wrong Lee Simmons.

25:40.680 --> 25:43.400
I'm sorry. I shouldn't
have lost it like that.

25:44.280 --> 25:47.200
Violence is not cool.
You give your power away.

25:47.800 --> 25:50.560
Yeah, but it does show how passionate
and committed you are.

25:50.720 --> 25:52.800
I got a bit carried away.
I just...

25:55.040 --> 25:57.600
- Police wind me up.
- Don't worry about it.

25:58.400 --> 26:00.680
This is supposed to be
a frickin' rebellion, right?

26:00.800 --> 26:02.560
We need to get our blood pumping.

26:02.720 --> 26:05.680
We need to scare the fuck
out of the people in charge.

26:06.600 --> 26:09.880
Politicians won't do what needs to be
done unless they're forced to do it.

26:10.000 --> 26:11.560
- Lee Simmons?
- Yeah.

26:11.680 --> 26:13.200
Come to the desk, please.

26:15.240 --> 26:16.680
Over here.

26:19.000 --> 26:21.400
Anything to drink or any drugs
in the last 24 hours?

26:21.520 --> 26:22.520
No.

26:22.640 --> 26:24.480
Have you got anything on you
that can harm me or you?

26:24.600 --> 26:25.840
No.

26:30.240 --> 26:33.280
On this occasion, we're not gonna
charge you, but I must warn you,

26:33.520 --> 26:37.720
that the people you're with today are a
known group of dangerous activists.

26:38.600 --> 26:40.920
Dangerous
when they're environmentalists?

26:41.040 --> 26:43.840
You think environmentalists
are not a threat to public safety?

26:43.960 --> 26:44.960
I can assure you they are.

26:45.080 --> 26:47.160
These are the people who sacrifice
their time and energy

26:47.280 --> 26:51.640
to save our planet or try to.
Yeah, they deserve our respect.

26:51.760 --> 26:53.640
They're fighting for our futures.

26:53.800 --> 26:56.600
- Some of them, maybe.
- What do you mean, some of them?

26:56.720 --> 26:59.320
It was your lot that turned up
and started causing trouble.

26:59.440 --> 27:01.080
You should be grateful

27:01.200 --> 27:03.280
that there are people willing
to paint their faces like this

27:03.400 --> 27:06.720
and bring attention to the destruction
of the biosphere.

27:07.840 --> 27:10.200
- Do you want me to charge you?
- No, sorry.

27:27.440 --> 27:29.480
There it is, 50,000.

27:31.080 --> 27:32.800
Fifty thousand, huh?

27:36.400 --> 27:38.720
How much did you make on the deal?

27:39.120 --> 27:41.080
- Nothing.
-Nothing.

27:46.440 --> 27:48.880
- Here.
- No, no, I couldn't possibly.

27:48.960 --> 27:52.000
I can use this blood money,
but you're too good now?

27:52.360 --> 27:54.160
You earned it, remember?

27:57.440 --> 27:59.440
Take the fucking money.

28:02.200 --> 28:03.720
Forgive me.

28:07.000 --> 28:09.080
Only two people can forgive you.

28:09.920 --> 28:12.280
One is my sister,
and the other one is God.

28:13.400 --> 28:15.040
Do you believe in God?

28:18.240 --> 28:19.880
No.

28:23.480 --> 28:25.040
Bad luck.

29:10.840 --> 29:13.080
You want to bring the tube
to a standstill?

29:13.440 --> 29:14.640
Yes.

29:16.520 --> 29:19.040
That's why you wanted my job.

29:19.120 --> 29:21.480
To be a fifth columnist
inside the CTIP?

29:21.680 --> 29:22.920
Yep.

29:23.240 --> 29:25.120
Look, Sophie's taking the piss,

29:25.280 --> 29:28.600
but, we thought we could
use your bunker as base camp.

29:29.480 --> 29:34.280
Move activists on and off the tracks.
We could take the tube down for weeks.

29:34.400 --> 29:36.400
No, you don't want to
piss off tube passengers.

29:36.520 --> 29:38.960
We need to piss them off.
We need them to listen.

29:39.160 --> 29:41.240
Look, I don't think
you've fully thought through

29:41.360 --> 29:45.640
the oppressive power of the state
machinery you're gonna be unleashing.

29:46.120 --> 29:48.840
- One beef, two vegan. There you go.
- Thank you.

29:50.120 --> 29:52.640
Look, they'll be down there
with dogs, guns, tear gas.

29:52.760 --> 29:54.760
You'll get the full-on
terrorist treatment.

29:54.880 --> 29:58.080
And it will not take them long
to find you and the bunker.

29:59.360 --> 30:00.840
So, is that a yes?

30:02.960 --> 30:05.960
Yeah, but not to that plan.

30:10.440 --> 30:11.920
This great city.

30:12.760 --> 30:15.320
This city is a coat
you've wrapped yourself in.

30:15.640 --> 30:17.840
It flatters your vanity.

30:18.040 --> 30:20.880
But a coat cannot protect you
from a tsunami.

30:21.760 --> 30:25.280
We are facing
an environmental cataclysm.

30:26.080 --> 30:28.200
The banks
of the Thames will break,

30:28.320 --> 30:31.480
and your coat will not
protect you from the floods.

30:32.200 --> 30:35.360
First, the undergrounds
will all be filled with water,

30:35.560 --> 30:37.800
and then the streets will flood.

31:10.240 --> 31:11.840
Oi!

31:13.280 --> 31:15.560
What do you think
you're doing, mate?

31:21.520 --> 31:23.640
Don't even fucking think about it.

31:25.520 --> 31:28.120
Do that again and I'll knock you out.

31:47.960 --> 31:49.600
Weed, coke?

31:51.360 --> 31:53.360
- You got coke?
- You want some?

31:53.880 --> 31:56.360
- Come on. It's good stuff.
- How much?

31:57.160 --> 32:01.360
- One-twenty.
- One-twenty?

32:02.920 --> 32:03.920
Hundred.

32:04.040 --> 32:07.000
Nope. You're pretty fucking rude,
do you know that?

32:07.840 --> 32:09.960
Come on.
Put me out of my misery.

32:10.800 --> 32:12.400
Come on, follow me.

32:24.560 --> 32:27.000
- Want some?
- No thanks, mate. No.

32:27.280 --> 32:30.960
Don't be staying here too long,
yeah, because you'll get nicked.

32:32.960 --> 32:35.720
And go steady with that stuff.
It's strong.

32:37.560 --> 32:39.560
What are you?
A drug dealer or a drug counsellor?

32:39.680 --> 32:41.280
Shut up, you mug.

32:54.920 --> 32:56.960
Are you all right, darling?

33:09.760 --> 33:11.200
Hi.

33:12.640 --> 33:17.000
I wasn't,
but I bought some cocaine,

33:17.120 --> 33:19.760
and I've definitely
ironed out my creases.

33:19.880 --> 33:21.960
Can I iron out some
of my creases?

33:23.160 --> 33:24.560
By all means.

33:26.280 --> 33:29.680
Not on a dirty bin.
Follow me.

34:59.600 --> 35:02.320
- What's the matter?
- Dennis has vomited.

35:02.440 --> 35:04.200
-Twice.
-So, we're leaving.

35:05.000 --> 35:06.960
You know what?
I think that's a good idea.

35:07.120 --> 35:10.720
I think you should go home. I've kept
you here long enough. I'm so sorry.

35:10.920 --> 35:13.920
Just before you go, I just want to give
you something for the nausea.

35:14.280 --> 35:17.400
It will make you feel better
in just a few minutes.

35:18.960 --> 35:21.680
It's also a good one
for your immune system.

35:22.440 --> 35:26.760
Here we go.
It's a really long day. I realize.

35:33.240 --> 35:34.680
There we go.

35:42.000 --> 35:46.000
What if I said we could switch every
traffic light to red simultaneously

35:46.120 --> 35:48.200
within a two-mile radius
of Temple?

35:48.520 --> 35:49.720
Can we?

35:50.200 --> 35:53.440
- Potentially. Yeah.
- Potentially?

35:54.440 --> 35:58.480
Like my school reports had me potentially
earmarked to be head girl?

35:59.440 --> 36:02.240
Yeah, exactly.
Potentially, as in realistically

36:02.560 --> 36:04.480
or like in a mad plan kind of way?

36:04.600 --> 36:07.800
Definitely no more mad
than jumping on electric train tracks.

36:07.920 --> 36:09.080
But how?

36:11.360 --> 36:12.840
It's so easy.

36:13.720 --> 36:16.680
Yeah. It basically involves
just pulling out a few wires.

36:16.880 --> 36:18.120
Where are these wires?

36:18.240 --> 36:19.880
It's inside a power supply box,

36:20.000 --> 36:24.000
which we can easily gain access to,
thanks to our mole being inside the CTIP.

36:24.120 --> 36:25.120
Where?

36:25.240 --> 36:27.880
It's really close.
It's located really close to Temple.

36:28.200 --> 36:30.600
We just wander in,
pull up some wires and leave?

36:30.800 --> 36:33.320
Gridlock the whole of Central London,
if you like.

36:33.480 --> 36:34.880
Easy as that?

36:35.520 --> 36:37.600
We just need to pick up a key.

38:05.280 --> 38:06.960
I know what you did.

38:10.640 --> 38:12.480
I know what you did.

38:31.240 --> 38:35.280
Okay. Yeah, I just better take this.

38:42.640 --> 38:43.760
Daniel?

38:43.960 --> 38:46.280
- Lee, can you hear me?
- Yeah. No, I can hear you.

38:46.400 --> 38:49.000
- You all right?
- I need to see Eve.

38:49.640 --> 38:52.840
- Have you been drinking?
- Look, I need to see Eve.

38:53.920 --> 38:56.080
Listen... Mate, I...

38:57.400 --> 39:00.080
- I don't think that's a good idea.
- What? Why not?

39:00.280 --> 39:02.440
Look, just... Yeah.
Maybe wait till morning.

39:02.560 --> 39:03.920
Are you with her now?

39:06.800 --> 39:11.240
No, no, no, no. I'm in a bar.
I am in a bar. But I... Yeah...

39:12.480 --> 39:15.000
- Yeah, no, she's with me.
- Where?

39:17.520 --> 39:19.920
Mate, just tell me
where you are, Lee.

39:53.160 --> 39:56.000
To traffic lights.

39:59.640 --> 40:00.960
Oi.

40:01.480 --> 40:03.000
Hey.

40:04.920 --> 40:06.480
What's he doing here?

40:06.920 --> 40:10.560
I thought I'd come and have a drink
with my friend and my daughter.

40:11.280 --> 40:13.440
Hi. I'm Daniel. I'm Eve's dad.

40:13.560 --> 40:16.760
- I'm Ash. Nice to meet you, man. Drink?
- No, he's not staying.

40:16.880 --> 40:20.560
- Sure. Yeah. Let's all have a drink.
- Just go.

40:21.440 --> 40:23.000
Eve?

40:25.480 --> 40:27.040
Are you on drugs?

40:28.640 --> 40:31.640
- Look, I've had a tough day.
- You've had a tough day?

40:32.440 --> 40:35.120
Yeah, I've been to hell
and back. I...

40:37.360 --> 40:40.240
I'm really tired.
I just want to talk to my daughter.

40:40.480 --> 40:42.080
"My daughter."

40:42.640 --> 40:45.920
You do know,
I'm a person separate from you, right?

40:47.000 --> 40:49.360
And actually,
I don't want to see you.

40:55.960 --> 40:58.640
Why don't we all sit down,
and I'll get some drinks in, yeah?

40:58.760 --> 41:02.160
- Yeah, come on, mate.
- I just want to talk to...

41:02.280 --> 41:05.400
Why do you even want to see me
when you're like this?

41:06.040 --> 41:08.800
Like what?

41:09.480 --> 41:12.800
Human?
Flawed, exhausted...

41:12.920 --> 41:17.000
No, high, self-absorbed,
completely out of touch with reality.

41:17.400 --> 41:19.560
- Eve, come on.
- No, he's the problem.

41:19.960 --> 41:21.920
You're the fucking problem.

41:24.400 --> 41:25.440
What are you talking about?

41:25.560 --> 41:27.800
You're just looking after your own needs.

41:27.920 --> 41:30.480
You just see people
in relation to yourself.

41:30.800 --> 41:33.960
All I've ever thought about
all my life are your needs.

41:34.080 --> 41:35.440
When?

41:37.600 --> 41:41.240
- Forever.
- I've been totally alone.

41:42.200 --> 41:43.480
- Eve, come on...
- No.

41:43.600 --> 41:46.960
The superstar doctor,
the amazing surgeon.

41:49.120 --> 41:51.720
Well, you know
you're the shittest father.

42:01.120 --> 42:02.680
Right.

42:09.840 --> 42:11.520
Am I that bad?

42:19.960 --> 42:22.320
No, no, mate. She doesn't mean that.
She's just upset.

42:22.440 --> 42:23.840
No. No. No.

43:27.760 --> 43:29.320
Go!
