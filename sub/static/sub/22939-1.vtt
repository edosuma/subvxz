- Buying or selling?

01:03.897 --> 01:05.199
- Browsing.

01:08.736 --> 01:11.605
Window shopping, if I'm
being completely honest.

01:11.639 --> 01:14.508
I just started my Christmas
shopping today, okay?

01:14.542 --> 01:17.445
Every year, I tell myself,
start in July,

01:17.478 --> 01:19.313
do a little bit each month...

01:19.347 --> 01:21.715
You'll be so happy when
the Yuletide rolls in.

01:21.749 --> 01:23.684
And I know what
you're thinking:

01:23.717 --> 01:26.120
tell us something about
the person you're shopping for.

01:26.154 --> 01:28.156
Do they have hobbies,
interests,

01:28.189 --> 01:29.457
fetishes...

01:29.490 --> 01:31.225
allergies.

01:31.259 --> 01:33.194
Well, here's the thing.

01:33.227 --> 01:35.896
I am not entirely sure
I want the gift

01:35.929 --> 01:38.332
to be stolen per se.

01:39.633 --> 01:41.369
No offense.

01:41.402 --> 01:43.637
See what I did there,
half-crackin'?

01:43.671 --> 01:45.439
I said "fence"

01:45.473 --> 01:47.575
'cause you're
the premiere fence

01:47.608 --> 01:49.443
on the West Coast.

01:49.477 --> 01:51.579
El Proveedor.

01:55.516 --> 01:58.352
Provedor?

01:58.386 --> 02:00.621
May I call you...

02:00.654 --> 02:02.223
Glenn?

02:05.259 --> 02:07.528
*

02:15.469 --> 02:17.371
- Who the hell wears a beard
over a beard?

02:17.405 --> 02:19.507
- Who wears a beard-beard?

02:19.540 --> 02:21.709
Overachievers.

02:21.742 --> 02:23.377
That's who, Jack.

02:26.414 --> 02:28.682
*

02:30.351 --> 02:32.520
Hook-beak!

02:32.553 --> 02:35.189
Double hook-beak.

02:36.390 --> 02:37.425
Finger.

02:49.437 --> 02:53.607
*

02:53.641 --> 02:55.543
- Hey, whoa, no.

02:55.576 --> 02:57.411
Easy, easy.

02:57.445 --> 02:59.647
Down, down. Put it down.

02:59.680 --> 03:01.815
Everyone. You. Put it down.

03:04.518 --> 03:07.488
- * Merry Christmas, I don't
want to fight tonight *

03:07.521 --> 03:10.391
* Merry Christmas, I don't
want to fight tonight *

03:10.424 --> 03:13.261
* Merry Christmas, I
don't want to fight tonight *

03:13.294 --> 03:14.695
* With you

03:14.728 --> 03:16.830
*

03:16.864 --> 03:19.700
* Where is Santa
at his sleigh? *

03:19.733 --> 03:23.304
* Tell me, why is it
always this way? *

03:23.337 --> 03:25.706
* Where is Rudolph?
Where is Blitzen? *

03:25.739 --> 03:27.475
* Baby, Merry Christmas

03:27.508 --> 03:29.510
* Merry, merry,
merry Christmas *

03:29.543 --> 03:30.820
* All the children
are tucked in their beds *

03:32.846 --> 03:35.583
- * Sugar-plum fairies
dancing in their heads *

03:35.616 --> 03:38.719
*

03:44.492 --> 03:46.327
- * I love you
and you love me *

03:46.360 --> 03:47.695
- Oh, come on, let's go.

03:47.728 --> 03:50.464
- * The way
it's got to be *

03:50.498 --> 03:53.033
* I loved you
from the start *

03:53.066 --> 03:54.735
* 'Cause Christmas
ain't the time *

03:54.768 --> 03:56.837
* For breaking each other's
hearts *

03:56.870 --> 04:00.040
* Where is Santa
at his sleigh? *

04:00.073 --> 04:03.344
* Tell me, why is it
always this way? *

04:03.377 --> 04:05.846
* Where is Rudolph?
Where is Blitzen? *

04:05.879 --> 04:07.648
* Baby, Merry Christmas

04:07.681 --> 04:09.717
* Merry, merry,
merry Christmas *

04:09.750 --> 04:12.620
* All the children are
tucked in their beds *

04:12.653 --> 04:15.656
* Sugar-plum fairies
dancing in their heads *

04:15.689 --> 04:18.358
* Snowball fighting,
it's so exciting, baby *

04:20.761 --> 04:22.530
- * Yeah, yeah, yeah

04:22.563 --> 04:24.865
* I love you,
and you love me *

04:24.898 --> 04:28.369
* And that's the way
it's got to be *

04:28.402 --> 04:31.071
* I loved you
from the start *

04:31.104 --> 04:33.341
* 'Cause Christmas ain't
the time for breaking *

04:33.374 --> 04:35.075
* Each other's hearts

04:35.108 --> 04:38.312
* Merry Christmas,
I don't want to fight *

04:38.346 --> 04:41.815
* Tonight with you

04:54.562 --> 04:55.663
Damn it.

05:01.702 --> 05:03.937
Guys. Gentlemen.

05:03.971 --> 05:07.808
Upon further review,
this is not my sack.

05:07.841 --> 05:10.310
My sack is... much smaller.

05:11.779 --> 05:13.414
So if you see my sack,

05:13.447 --> 05:15.716
would you do me a favor
and, uh...

05:17.885 --> 05:19.853
- The problem for me is
Neil deGrasse Tyson

05:19.887 --> 05:21.755
gets as much wrong
as he gets right.

05:25.526 --> 05:27.437
I mean, I just don't appreciate
being talked down to,

05:27.461 --> 05:29.597
especially about astrophysics.

05:32.833 --> 05:34.668
Hawking is in the ballpark.

05:34.702 --> 05:36.937
He gets it half right.
He knows that.

05:38.639 --> 05:40.874
Do we have a security person?

05:44.445 --> 05:46.680
*

05:46.714 --> 05:47.791
- I'm gonna have to see
some ID...

05:47.815 --> 05:48.816
Ugh!

05:48.849 --> 05:53.153
*

05:54.888 --> 06:01.762
*

06:07.801 --> 06:09.503
- I don't remember
giving you permission

06:09.537 --> 06:11.572
to borrow my Hagrid costume,
Shawn.

06:14.608 --> 06:16.777
*

06:16.810 --> 06:18.846
- Gus, eyes forward.

06:18.879 --> 06:20.448
These guys are armed.

06:20.481 --> 06:21.982
- Taking cases
without me again?

06:22.015 --> 06:23.860
- I have to take on cases
without you; you have a job.

06:23.884 --> 06:25.895
- I gave the San Francisco
detective thing a chance.

06:25.919 --> 06:27.531
- Eleven days, Gus.
We were here for eleven days

06:27.555 --> 06:28.989
before you got
a full-time gig.

06:29.022 --> 06:30.467
- Look, how many times
do we have to do this?

06:30.491 --> 06:32.660
I need security.
Security!

06:33.827 --> 06:35.663
- Hey, man. Is that sourdough?

06:35.696 --> 06:37.665
- You know damn well
it's sourdough.

06:37.698 --> 06:39.443
- Why don't you, uh, pass
half that sweet sandy

06:39.467 --> 06:40.768
under the table?

06:40.801 --> 06:42.570
- You must be out
of your damn mind.

06:42.603 --> 06:43.713
- Well, then will you
at least do me a solid

06:43.737 --> 06:44.872
and go pull the fire alarm?

06:45.873 --> 06:47.775
- If I pull the fire alarm,

06:47.808 --> 06:49.543
people will evacuate
the whole building.

06:49.577 --> 06:51.137
- Yes, Gus.
That's what I'm counting on.

06:51.845 --> 06:53.781
- Okay.

06:58.251 --> 06:59.920
- Excuse me, sir.

06:59.953 --> 07:01.865
You guys looking for a
transient with half a beard?

07:01.889 --> 07:03.524
He pushed his way up
to our elevator

07:03.557 --> 07:04.958
and broke my secret Santa gift.

07:04.992 --> 07:07.761
Would you mind taking your
business outside?

07:07.795 --> 07:09.563
- He's in the elevator?

07:09.597 --> 07:10.707
- Probably in the lobby
by now.

07:10.731 --> 07:11.832
Let's go.

07:14.868 --> 07:18.506
*

07:20.674 --> 07:22.242
- Burton?

07:22.275 --> 07:24.712
Can we have a word
in my office?

07:26.046 --> 07:27.548
- Man...

07:30.083 --> 07:34.087
*

07:34.121 --> 07:35.756
- * In between the lines

07:35.789 --> 07:37.825
* There's a lot of obscurity

07:37.858 --> 07:41.094
* I'm not inclined to resign
to maturity *

07:41.128 --> 07:43.063
* If it's all right

07:43.096 --> 07:44.965
* Then you're all wrong

07:44.998 --> 07:48.101
* But why bounce around
to the same damn song *

07:48.135 --> 07:50.070
*

07:50.103 --> 07:53.841
* You'd rather run when
you can't crawl *

07:53.874 --> 07:55.709
*

07:55.743 --> 07:57.578
* I know, you know

07:57.611 --> 07:58.946
* That I'm not
telling the truth *

07:58.979 --> 08:00.848
* I know, you know

08:00.881 --> 08:02.282
* They just don't have
any proof *

08:02.315 --> 08:04.051
* Embrace the deception

08:04.084 --> 08:05.819
* Learn how to bend

08:05.853 --> 08:07.655
* Your worst inhibitions

08:07.688 --> 08:09.823
* Tend to psych you out
ih the end *

08:09.857 --> 08:12.760
*

08:16.797 --> 08:18.566
- * It's Christmastime again

08:18.599 --> 08:19.867
*

08:19.900 --> 08:22.770
* That magical time of year

08:22.803 --> 08:24.204
*

08:25.906 --> 08:28.942
- You do not want to know how
far I had to go to get this.

08:28.976 --> 08:30.678
- No.
- And to add insult to injury,

08:30.711 --> 08:32.312
they'd never even heard
of almond milk.

08:32.345 --> 08:33.647
- What?!
- Any of the nut milks.

08:33.681 --> 08:34.914
- Ugh.
- I know.

08:34.948 --> 08:36.650
- What'd I miss?
- We got eight.

08:36.683 --> 08:37.794
- Hey, that's a solid
day of work.

08:37.818 --> 08:39.285
- Yeah. Let's just pack it in.

08:44.625 --> 08:46.026
*

08:46.059 --> 08:49.563
- Soft pass?

08:49.597 --> 08:51.799
- Or nine.
I got one more.

08:51.832 --> 08:53.834
- Copy.
Just don't go alone.

09:01.341 --> 09:02.342
- She went alone.

09:02.375 --> 09:03.811
Somebody cover her back.

09:03.844 --> 09:06.680
Kidding.
I'm on it.

09:06.714 --> 09:13.721
*

09:21.128 --> 09:23.263
- Dude, you literally made

09:23.296 --> 09:25.599
every obvious move
you could make.

09:25.633 --> 09:27.300
I say this with disappointment,

09:27.334 --> 09:29.615
because I was actually hoping
to get in some cardio today.

09:32.072 --> 09:35.976
I'm so sorry, Juliet.

09:36.009 --> 09:38.045
- What the hell are you doing?

09:38.078 --> 09:40.313
- I can explain.
Please let me go.

09:44.985 --> 09:51.992
*

09:52.425 --> 09:54.628
- Go.

10:02.936 --> 10:04.805
- He got away?

10:04.838 --> 10:06.674
- Yep.

10:08.909 --> 10:10.744
- So he was just...

10:10.778 --> 10:13.747
transporting the goods from
the café to the alley here.

10:13.781 --> 10:15.391
- I guess so.
- That's what it looks like.

10:15.415 --> 10:16.917
- Yeah.

10:19.953 --> 10:26.960
*

10:40.073 --> 10:41.842
- I'm absolutely dazzled

10:41.875 --> 10:43.911
by what you've done
with the place, Sammy.

10:43.944 --> 10:45.979
Problem is, you were not
supposed to be home yet,

10:46.013 --> 10:48.348
but I'm nothing if not
an improviser.

10:49.449 --> 10:50.818
- Billy?

10:50.851 --> 10:52.419
- Now let's be honest.

10:52.452 --> 10:54.154
I've never really looked
like a Billy.

10:56.724 --> 10:57.925
Call me the Duke.

10:59.159 --> 11:00.828
The Duke?

11:00.861 --> 11:02.462
Is this, uh,

11:02.495 --> 11:04.932
Criminal Edition"?

11:06.233 --> 11:07.400
Looks good on you, though.

11:07.434 --> 11:08.736
Yeah.

11:08.769 --> 11:12.205
Um, in all fairness, though,

11:12.239 --> 11:14.708
there is something
you should know.

11:18.078 --> 11:20.480
My partner's adamant
about home security.

11:25.085 --> 11:27.721
- If we're going to do this,

11:27.755 --> 11:29.915
then there's a fun fact you
should know about me, mate.

11:31.124 --> 11:32.960
I no longer work alone.

11:42.970 --> 11:44.872
- Billy...

11:44.905 --> 11:46.807
Come on, there's no need
to escalate this.

11:46.840 --> 11:48.708
We can talk this through.

11:50.510 --> 11:54.114
- You know I hate negotiation,
Samuel.

12:02.055 --> 12:03.991
- O'Hara?
- Hi.

12:04.024 --> 12:08.862
- Um, I have a difficult,
private matter

12:08.896 --> 12:11.064
I need to talk to you about
outside of the office.

12:11.098 --> 12:12.866
- Okay, sure.
Come on in.

12:12.900 --> 12:14.434
- Thanks.

12:14.467 --> 12:17.204
- Uh, just let me get Richard
off to the airport.

12:17.237 --> 12:19.873
- Um... your husband's here?

12:19.907 --> 12:21.875
- Well, yeah, why wouldn't
he be in our house?

12:21.909 --> 12:24.978
- Oh, well, it's just in all
of the time I've known you,

12:25.012 --> 12:26.980
I've never actually...

12:27.014 --> 12:27.981
seen him.

12:28.015 --> 12:29.516
- Really?

12:29.549 --> 12:30.794
Oh, that's not right.
- Mm-hmm, yeah.

12:30.818 --> 12:31.928
- Just give me five minutes,

12:31.952 --> 12:34.221
and we'll ride in together.

12:37.257 --> 12:44.264
*

12:47.167 --> 12:48.969
- Please don't tell her.

12:49.002 --> 12:51.538
- What choice do I have?

12:51.571 --> 12:54.007
You put me in
this position.

12:54.041 --> 12:55.876
What the hell are
you doing, Iris?

12:55.909 --> 12:57.510
- There are these girls.
They're awful.

12:57.544 --> 12:59.579
But they offered me a chance
to be a part of them.

12:59.612 --> 13:00.981
And I just had
to prove myself...

13:01.014 --> 13:02.883
- You have to tell your mom.

13:02.916 --> 13:04.260
- You know they want to make
her the police commissioner.

13:04.284 --> 13:06.486
This will ruin everything.

13:08.088 --> 13:10.323
- Okay. Here is what
you are going to do.

13:10.357 --> 13:13.060
You are going to call me
every single day.

13:13.093 --> 13:15.195
You are never to hang out
with those girls again,

13:15.228 --> 13:17.297
and should you find yourself
being bullied,

13:17.330 --> 13:18.966
you are going to text me
where you are,

13:18.999 --> 13:20.901
and I will rain hell
on the guilty party.

13:20.934 --> 13:22.269
Pinky swear?

13:23.937 --> 13:25.205
- Oh, look at you two.

13:25.238 --> 13:28.008
Best friends.
Slightly jealous.

13:28.041 --> 13:29.142
Here.

13:30.543 --> 13:31.945
You ready?
- Mm-hmm.

13:31.979 --> 13:34.181
- Okay.

13:36.383 --> 13:38.585
- Chief...

13:38.618 --> 13:41.354
you know that thing I was
gonna talk to you about?

13:41.388 --> 13:44.124
Y-you have a lot on
your plate right now,

13:44.157 --> 13:45.301
and it's really not
that important...

13:45.325 --> 13:46.860
- Okay, just stop.

13:46.894 --> 13:47.971
I think I know what
this is about,

13:47.995 --> 13:49.262
and it is important.

13:49.296 --> 13:51.631
- Oh, God, you do?
- Of course I do.

13:51.664 --> 13:54.234
But, you know, maybe...

13:54.267 --> 13:57.037
maybe marriage was never gonna
be the right choice for you.

13:57.070 --> 13:58.238
- What?

13:58.271 --> 13:59.973
- Oh, God, you know
I love Shawn.

14:00.007 --> 14:02.209
And he is an extraordinary
person, but maybe

14:02.242 --> 14:04.577
your goals and his goals were
just never gonna line up

14:04.611 --> 14:05.879
in the end.

14:05.913 --> 14:07.147
Oh, no.

14:07.180 --> 14:08.648
Um, no.
This is not about me.

14:08.681 --> 14:10.083
- No, of course it's not, no.

14:10.117 --> 14:11.985
It's about the both of you.

14:12.019 --> 14:13.930
- Okay, we are really
misunderstanding each other

14:13.954 --> 14:15.055
right now.

14:15.088 --> 14:16.165
- Okay, but it's easy to notice

14:16.189 --> 14:17.557
that you don't wear a ring.

14:19.092 --> 14:21.661
- Look, I am in no rush.

14:21.694 --> 14:22.934
- I just think the question is,

14:22.963 --> 14:24.231
how long are you gonna wait?

14:25.999 --> 14:28.101
I hope I'm wrong.

14:28.135 --> 14:29.937
And I hope it's with Shawn.

14:29.970 --> 14:30.971
- Mm.

14:33.073 --> 14:34.641
Sorry, yeah.

14:34.674 --> 14:36.109
O'Hara.

14:40.280 --> 14:41.614
- The man who stole from me

14:41.648 --> 14:44.051
entered the boat
right behind you.

14:46.153 --> 14:47.254
Tell me how you know him.

14:47.287 --> 14:49.589
- I never seen him before.

14:51.191 --> 14:53.093
I'm not foolish enough
to lie to you.

14:53.126 --> 14:55.228
- Hey, El, we found something
on the beard.

15:00.400 --> 15:01.701
- Find this man.

15:01.734 --> 15:04.637
This Burton Guster.

15:10.743 --> 15:17.951
*

15:28.228 --> 15:29.997
- It looks amazing,
doesn't it?

15:30.030 --> 15:31.999
I just finished the addition.

15:32.032 --> 15:33.233
I matched it exactly

15:33.266 --> 15:34.410
with the 30th Anniversary
Blu-Ray.

15:34.434 --> 15:36.136
- Of "Gremlins"?
- Cheers.

15:36.169 --> 15:37.670
- Shawn, we are eight feet
underground

15:37.704 --> 15:39.339
at the end of an alley
in Chinatown.

15:39.372 --> 15:41.975
- Gus, don't be the comma
in Earth, Wind & Fire.

15:42.009 --> 15:44.711
This is a glorious triumph,

15:44.744 --> 15:46.455
especially considering all
the restrictions you gave me.

15:46.479 --> 15:48.315
- Restrictions?
- Oh, let's see here:

15:48.348 --> 15:50.217
cable car adjacent,

15:50.250 --> 15:52.452
gotta be smelling distance
from Ghirardelli Square...

15:52.485 --> 15:54.221
- That's half the city
with my nose.

15:54.254 --> 15:56.023
And we both know the problem
is the name.

15:56.056 --> 15:58.691
- You shut your drunk mouth.

15:58.725 --> 16:00.393
That name is spun gold.

16:00.427 --> 16:02.005
- It literally looks like
a bunch of letters

16:02.029 --> 16:03.030
pushed together.

16:04.431 --> 16:06.099
- Psychphrancisco.

16:06.133 --> 16:09.236
One word, all lowercase,
ph for the f.

16:10.170 --> 16:11.471
What's not to understand, Gus?

16:11.504 --> 16:13.140
- If we're gonna get
walk-up traffic,

16:13.173 --> 16:14.683
we need a business name
that makes sense.

16:14.707 --> 16:16.019
And we can't keep
making additions

16:16.043 --> 16:17.110
until we get more cases.

16:17.144 --> 16:19.146
- Gus.

16:19.179 --> 16:20.456
I don't mean to talk
down to you,

16:20.480 --> 16:22.182
but are you familiar
with the expression,

16:22.215 --> 16:24.117
"you gotta spend money
to buy things"?

16:24.151 --> 16:25.418
- That's not at all
how it goes,

16:25.452 --> 16:27.130
and you haven't heard it
both ways. What...

16:27.154 --> 16:30.523
- Immaterial, because we
already have a case.

16:30.557 --> 16:32.792
A big one.
You should sit down.

16:32.825 --> 16:34.694
- On what?
- The rickshaw.

16:36.729 --> 16:38.265
Okay, listen.

16:38.298 --> 16:40.133
Juliet's partner,
sweet Sam Sloane...

16:40.167 --> 16:41.501
He's in the ICU.

16:41.534 --> 16:43.212
He was attacked in
his own home last night.

16:43.236 --> 16:44.804
He's barely hanging on, Gus.

16:44.837 --> 16:46.282
We got to get down to
the hospital right away.

16:46.306 --> 16:48.541
- Oh, man.
And the police asked for us?

16:48.575 --> 16:50.310
- Since when do they
have to ask?

16:50.343 --> 16:52.079
Gus, we show up, I do
a little of this.

16:52.112 --> 16:53.222
Even less of that.
One of those.

16:53.246 --> 16:54.414
The rest writes itself.

16:54.447 --> 16:55.815
- Shawn, you know
I can't do that.

16:55.848 --> 16:57.288
I have to make all
my holiday bonuses

16:57.317 --> 16:58.818
just to keep this
money pit afloat.

16:58.851 --> 17:00.553
- I figured you'd say
something like that.

17:00.587 --> 17:02.555
Which is why I'm pitching this
to sweeten the pot:

17:02.589 --> 17:04.090
as we drive across town,

17:04.124 --> 17:06.492
we stop at every
single Cinnabon.

17:06.526 --> 17:08.194
- I'm listening.

17:08.228 --> 17:09.829
- We Pandora up
a Prince death tribute...

17:09.862 --> 17:11.564
- Shawn, you know Prince
isn't really dead.

17:11.598 --> 17:12.840
- And by the time we're
finished later tonight,

17:12.865 --> 17:14.434
you're at the observatory

17:14.467 --> 17:17.170
for the Starry Night
Telescope Viewing Party

17:17.204 --> 17:18.438
on Mt. McCumber.

17:18.471 --> 17:20.440
- That telescope party
is tonight.

17:20.473 --> 17:22.175
- I hear it gets
wilder every year.

17:22.209 --> 17:23.310
- Not possible, Shawn.

17:23.343 --> 17:24.810
Not possible.

17:24.844 --> 17:26.779
- We'll see about that,
won't we?

17:31.551 --> 17:33.253
Oh, wow.

17:33.286 --> 17:35.188
Sam has a lot of friends.

17:35.222 --> 17:37.200
- Everyone's head's down.
That can't be a good sign.

17:37.224 --> 17:38.334
- All right, everyone,
listen up.

17:38.358 --> 17:40.193
- Uh-oh.
- Whoever did this

17:40.227 --> 17:42.462
had Inspector Sloane's alarm
code, knew his schedule,

17:42.495 --> 17:44.340
and shot him within a minute
of him entering his own house.

17:44.364 --> 17:46.133
- I can't see anything.

17:46.166 --> 17:47.510
- I see balloons over there.
He's probably...

17:47.534 --> 17:48.577
- We should've brought
a cake or something.

17:48.601 --> 17:49.869
- Is somebody here?

17:49.902 --> 17:52.472
- Hello.
- Chief.

17:52.505 --> 17:53.873
It's us, Chief.

17:53.906 --> 17:55.375
- Yes.
- Uh, 'scuse us, guys.

17:55.408 --> 17:57.310
I... I get it. It's unfair.

17:57.344 --> 17:58.845
You were here first,
but it's just...

17:58.878 --> 18:00.447
It's impossible to see
past you all,

18:00.480 --> 18:01.614
'cause you're, like,

18:01.648 --> 18:03.116
what are you feeding them?

18:03.150 --> 18:04.617
- What are you doing here?

18:04.651 --> 18:06.886
- Uh, we... uh, we just came
to pay our respects.

18:06.919 --> 18:09.856
- Oh, that's very nice of you.

18:09.889 --> 18:11.224
You done yet?

18:11.924 --> 18:14.227
- I didn't realize there
was a time limit.

18:14.261 --> 18:15.462
Please continue.

18:15.495 --> 18:16.572
- Okay, the only thing
that we know

18:16.596 --> 18:17.830
that they were able to take

18:17.864 --> 18:19.432
was Inspector Sloane's dongle.

18:19.466 --> 18:20.909
- Oh, my God!
- It's not what you think.

18:20.933 --> 18:22.535
- It's exactly what
I think, Gus.

18:22.569 --> 18:24.213
These people are monsters
and they must be stopped.

18:24.237 --> 18:25.314
- A dongle is
a security device.

18:25.338 --> 18:26.639
- Sure, for some people.

18:26.673 --> 18:28.308
- You stick it into
your computer.

18:28.341 --> 18:29.385
- Not my computer.
Not since high school.

18:29.409 --> 18:30.877
Jules, back me up on this.

18:30.910 --> 18:31.920
- Shawn, stop talking.
- All right.

18:31.944 --> 18:33.246
- This particular device

18:33.280 --> 18:34.814
allows an officer to access

18:34.847 --> 18:36.592
his or her confidential
San Francisco PD files.

18:36.616 --> 18:39.252
It's the only way that you
can get into the system.

18:39.286 --> 18:41.321
- You knew this?

18:41.354 --> 18:42.389
Okay. All right.

18:42.422 --> 18:43.823
So this is different.

18:43.856 --> 18:45.268
What you're saying
is a different thing.

18:45.292 --> 18:47.260
My bad.
Please continue.

18:47.294 --> 18:49.172
- Okay, Inspector Sloane's
dongle was right-angled

18:49.196 --> 18:50.197
and purple.

18:50.230 --> 18:51.264
- Ha, ha, ha.

18:51.298 --> 18:52.532
- Oh, my God.

18:52.565 --> 18:54.567
- Well, it's a little
silly, isn't it?

18:54.601 --> 18:56.536
- A word?

18:56.569 --> 18:59.206
Outside.

18:59.239 --> 19:01.274
- Excuse us, guys.
Sorry.

19:01.308 --> 19:02.875
- Hey, hon, what's up?

19:02.909 --> 19:04.420
- Why are you here?
- To offer our services.

19:04.444 --> 19:05.912
- He's here to offer
our services.

19:05.945 --> 19:07.290
I'm about to go check out
some black holes.

19:07.314 --> 19:08.524
- That was a bad
choice of words.

19:08.548 --> 19:10.317
- Out of context,
I regretted it.

19:10.350 --> 19:11.960
- Sweetheart, this is Sam,
okay? He's family.

19:11.984 --> 19:13.520
We're all in this thing
together.

19:13.553 --> 19:14.697
- Shawn, your offer is lovely,

19:14.721 --> 19:15.955
but the answer is no,

19:15.988 --> 19:17.424
and don't push me on this.

19:17.457 --> 19:18.925
Go home, go now,

19:18.958 --> 19:20.393
good-bye.

19:20.427 --> 19:22.595
- Wow.
- What?

19:24.397 --> 19:26.499
- Mm-mm-mm.

19:26.533 --> 19:28.268
- Where the hell did
you get a waffle?

19:28.301 --> 19:29.501
- Don't worry about it, Shawn.

19:39.612 --> 19:40.652
- Dude, she's so hardcore.

19:41.881 --> 19:43.450
- Shawn, she's dealing
with a lot.

19:43.483 --> 19:44.951
You need to give her
some space.

19:44.984 --> 19:46.695
Now, listen, tonight's moon
is a waxing gibbous

19:46.719 --> 19:48.421
and Venus is in retrograde.

19:48.455 --> 19:49.732
So we need to be at that
telescope before...

19:49.756 --> 19:50.866
- Gus, I can't do this
with you right now.

19:50.890 --> 19:52.359
Or ever, for that matter.

19:52.392 --> 19:54.394
- Psst.

19:54.427 --> 19:55.995
Guys. Over here.

19:56.028 --> 19:57.797
- Nick Conforth?

19:57.830 --> 19:59.599
- Why are you hiding?

19:59.632 --> 20:00.733
- I don't like hospitals.

20:00.767 --> 20:01.834
- Then why are you at one?

20:01.868 --> 20:03.470
- In San Francisco, no less.

20:03.503 --> 20:05.004
- I came to see Sam.

20:05.037 --> 20:07.006
I was his instructor
at the Academy.

20:07.039 --> 20:08.675
He was one of my best.
We're still close.

20:08.708 --> 20:09.985
- So close that you're
hanging outside?

20:10.009 --> 20:11.478
- Juliet kicked me out.

20:11.511 --> 20:12.612
- Huh. Us too.

20:12.645 --> 20:14.414
- Ah, that's not a coincidence.

20:14.447 --> 20:16.483
Listen, I don't know how
to tell you this,

20:16.516 --> 20:18.518
but she's hiding something.

20:18.551 --> 20:21.020
- Juliet, my Juliet?
- Nick, you sound paranoid.

20:21.053 --> 20:22.831
- Plus you're mixing horizontal
and vertical stripes.

20:22.855 --> 20:23.932
- While hiding behind
a reindeer and a menorah.

20:23.956 --> 20:25.592
- Hurts your credibility.

20:25.625 --> 20:26.902
- It's theologically
incongruous.

20:26.926 --> 20:28.595
- Look, Sam called me
yesterday.

20:28.628 --> 20:29.905
He was adamant no one
could be trusted.

20:29.929 --> 20:31.398
I said, what about
your partner?

20:31.431 --> 20:32.832
He said, "Especially not her."

20:32.865 --> 20:35.001
24 hours later, he's dead.

20:35.034 --> 20:36.503
- No, no, he's not dead.

20:36.536 --> 20:38.004
- Sorry. Survivor's remorse.

20:39.839 --> 20:41.784
- If this has anything to do
with my girlfriend...

20:41.808 --> 20:43.643
- Fiancé.
- Fiancé,

20:43.676 --> 20:45.476
you have to tell me everything
you know, Nick.

20:46.546 --> 20:47.690
- Sam said he kept getting
these calls

20:47.714 --> 20:49.482
from the same burner number.

20:49.516 --> 20:50.926
Something about
"the crimes of Juliet."

20:50.950 --> 20:52.685
He'd narrowed it down
to a signal

20:52.719 --> 20:54.062
that was pinged off of a tower
near Highway 18.

20:54.086 --> 20:55.755
He was gonna check it out.

20:55.788 --> 20:57.857
Next thing I know,
Sam's been killed.

20:57.890 --> 20:59.526
- He's still breathing.
- Respirator.

20:59.559 --> 21:01.594
- Yes, sorry.
That's on me.

21:01.628 --> 21:03.530
Guys, you know I still
have my issues.

21:03.563 --> 21:05.998
I crumble like pie crust
in the field.

21:06.032 --> 21:07.967
I saw you coming in here
and I thought

21:08.000 --> 21:10.637
maybe, hopefully, you could
check it out, since I can't.

21:10.670 --> 21:12.605
- No chance in hell.
- Absolutely.

21:12.639 --> 21:14.741
- Great. You guys are the best.

21:18.711 --> 21:20.813
Go.
- What did I just say, Shawn?

21:20.847 --> 21:22.949
- I don't know, something about
waxing Leeza Gibbons.

21:28.020 --> 21:30.657
- Shawn, we've been walking
for an hour.

21:30.690 --> 21:33.460
There's nothing around
for miles.

21:35.928 --> 21:37.830
- Aha. What do you suppose
the range is

21:37.864 --> 21:39.466
on that cell phone tower?

21:39.499 --> 21:40.776
- There's nothing here
but woods, pollen,

21:40.800 --> 21:41.968
and fruit bats.

21:42.001 --> 21:43.603
- Ah, ah, ah, oh!
What's this?

21:43.636 --> 21:45.472
Sunnyvale Mental Hospital.

21:45.505 --> 21:48.508
- Uh, no. I'm not going to
another insane asylum, Shawn.

21:48.541 --> 21:49.876
The sun is starting
to go down,

21:49.909 --> 21:51.487
and all the good telescopes
are gonna be gone.

21:51.511 --> 21:52.788
Dues are gonna be
doing eye-sneezes

21:52.812 --> 21:53.813
all over the equipment.

21:53.846 --> 21:55.682
- Man! All we have to do

21:55.715 --> 21:56.792
is go to the front desk
and ask if there's a patient

21:56.816 --> 21:58.551
with cell phone access.

21:58.585 --> 21:59.895
That's it!
Then we're off to Mt. McCumber

21:59.919 --> 22:01.754
where you can suck it.
- You suck it.

22:01.788 --> 22:03.656
* Suck it,
suck it, suck it *

22:03.690 --> 22:06.025
* Come on, son

22:07.126 --> 22:08.695
- The hell is an eye-sneeze?

22:08.728 --> 22:09.938
- Don't act like
you don't know.

22:09.962 --> 22:11.798
* Come on, son

22:11.831 --> 22:13.633
* Come on, son

22:13.666 --> 22:17.704
* Come on, son

22:17.737 --> 22:19.572
- This is not the road, Shawn.

22:19.606 --> 22:20.940
- Well, it has to be the road,

22:20.973 --> 22:22.875
because there are
no other roads.

22:24.911 --> 22:27.647
*

22:27.680 --> 22:28.648
What?

22:28.681 --> 22:30.550
- Dude.

22:30.583 --> 22:31.694
It says this place has been
closed for two years.

22:31.718 --> 22:33.019
- That's weird.
- Shawn,

22:33.052 --> 22:34.621
we need to get out of here.

22:34.654 --> 22:36.689
- Gus, don't be
the tender sweetness

22:36.723 --> 22:38.625
of a seasick
crocodile.

22:39.792 --> 22:42.629
We need...

22:42.662 --> 22:44.831
to go in.

23:02.181 --> 23:03.650
- What is that?
I know you hear that.

23:03.683 --> 23:05.952
What is that?

23:13.159 --> 23:14.661
Oh, my God.

23:14.694 --> 23:15.962
Are you playing Pokémon Go?

23:15.995 --> 23:17.797
- You know this is how
I manage my stress.

23:17.830 --> 23:19.699
I'm trying to hatch
a ten-kilometer egg

23:19.732 --> 23:21.176
and I'm pretty sure there might
be a Jigglypuff in there.

23:21.200 --> 23:22.802
- Stop it.
- You stop it.

23:22.835 --> 23:24.195
- You stop it right now.
This is...

23:27.073 --> 23:28.941
Gus, somebody tapped
into the power lines.

23:34.180 --> 23:35.982
This used to be
the high-security ward.

23:36.015 --> 23:38.017
That's why they built it
originally as a submarine.

23:38.050 --> 23:39.952
- It was never a submarine,
Shawn.

23:39.986 --> 23:41.588
- You don't know submarines.

23:41.621 --> 23:43.061
- I know you don't know.
I know that.

23:57.937 --> 24:00.973
Bad idea, Shawn.
- What do we think?

24:01.007 --> 24:02.942
- I say we slowly
start walking backwards

24:02.975 --> 24:04.620
so we never take our eyes
off of whatever poltergeist

24:04.644 --> 24:06.045
is making that glowing
over there,

24:06.078 --> 24:07.914
and then, we'll be
out of the demon's reach.

24:07.947 --> 24:09.716
We wind-sprint
back to the car.

24:09.749 --> 24:11.126
I'll leave first because
my heart is the purest.

24:11.150 --> 24:12.819
- It's definitely the blackest.

24:12.852 --> 24:14.687
My heart is not the...

24:14.721 --> 24:17.056
- Dude, that sound
is not human.

24:19.125 --> 24:20.827
- Agree to agree.

24:34.874 --> 24:37.243
- Shawn, I don't care what
that light is over there.

24:37.276 --> 24:39.054
There's no way we're gonna get
past that snapping...

24:41.748 --> 24:43.750
Gus, whatever got Sam attacked

24:43.783 --> 24:44.827
is right around that corner.

24:44.851 --> 24:46.653
And it's so serious that

24:46.686 --> 24:48.030
the bad guys have a guard dog
on a pogo stick

24:48.054 --> 24:49.789
holding down the fort.

24:49.822 --> 24:52.659
I need you to put on
your thinking helmet.

24:52.692 --> 24:54.794
- Man!
- I'll wait.

24:57.296 --> 24:59.298
- Chin strap.

25:02.034 --> 25:04.203
- You hear that?
- I don't hear anything, Shawn.

25:06.072 --> 25:08.007
- Exactly.

25:08.040 --> 25:09.809
The pooch is gone.

25:09.842 --> 25:12.178
And there's no sign
of another human being.

25:12.211 --> 25:14.981
The coast is clear.

25:17.249 --> 25:19.251
Damn it, Gus, is there
no end to this?

25:28.961 --> 25:29.961
Gus, wait a minute.

25:31.731 --> 25:33.766
That dog is a rescue.
- I don't care!

25:33.800 --> 25:35.210
- It means the bad guys
who adopted him

25:35.234 --> 25:36.803
trained him to be all ugly.

25:36.836 --> 25:38.204
- I still don't care, Shawn.

25:38.237 --> 25:40.907
- It means I can turn him.
- Into what?

25:40.940 --> 25:42.975
- Rescue dogs don't
have ugly hearts.

25:43.009 --> 25:45.244
- Shawn, there is no way
that dog doesn't eat your face.

25:45.277 --> 25:46.946
- Guys, don't be the C above
middle C

25:46.979 --> 25:48.256
in "Those Endearing
Young Charms."

25:48.280 --> 25:49.816
I have seen three
and a half episodes

25:49.849 --> 25:50.917
of "The Dog Whisperer."

25:50.950 --> 25:52.819
So?

25:52.852 --> 25:54.286
What are you doing?

25:54.320 --> 25:56.064
- I'm doing what he does.
- Why would he do that?

25:56.088 --> 25:57.724
- Because it works.
- Will you stop it?

25:57.757 --> 25:58.867
- You should take off
your helmet.

25:58.891 --> 25:59.935
I'm pretty sure it's broken.

26:01.060 --> 26:02.995
- I got this.

26:24.851 --> 26:27.987
- Hi.
Hi, buddy.

26:29.221 --> 26:32.959
Who's a good boy?

26:32.992 --> 26:35.094
Who's a sweet boy?

26:35.127 --> 26:37.396
Sit, sit.

26:40.032 --> 26:42.101
Gus, Gus!

26:42.134 --> 26:44.303
I'm going to lose.

26:46.172 --> 26:47.406
What the hell is that?

26:47.439 --> 26:49.308
- Cherry Chipotle
Turkey Jerky.

26:49.341 --> 26:50.943
- You've had that
the whole time?!

26:50.977 --> 26:52.320
- You know I'm
a nervous eater, Shawn.

26:52.344 --> 26:54.146
- Well, give it to me,
for the love of God!

26:54.180 --> 26:55.891
- What? You do realize this
stuff costs $19 an ounce?

26:55.915 --> 26:58.184
- I will pay you back!
- Come on, son.

27:02.088 --> 27:03.165
Try not to give him
the whole thing

27:03.189 --> 27:04.199
if you don't have to, Shawn.

27:04.223 --> 27:06.225
- Look. Look what I have.

27:06.258 --> 27:08.327
It's all for you, Damien.
- No.

27:09.328 --> 27:11.197
Shawn! It's not all for him!

27:11.831 --> 27:14.100
Aw, man.
- Gus, he likes it!

27:14.133 --> 27:16.903
He likes it.
Come here.

27:16.936 --> 27:19.405
Oh, come here. Oh.

27:19.438 --> 27:21.107
Who has a heart full of love?

27:21.140 --> 27:23.109
Did you like that jerky?

27:23.142 --> 27:25.377
Oh, look, yeah.
Look at this, Gus.

27:25.411 --> 27:27.313
Get in here.
Sweet little man.

27:27.346 --> 27:30.082
Thought he was getting adopted
by a family with a house

27:30.116 --> 27:31.984
and a big backyard,
and he ends up here

27:32.018 --> 27:34.253
in some haunted, abandoned
mental asylum.

27:34.286 --> 27:35.931
- And the next thing you know,
he's eating $56 worth

27:35.955 --> 27:37.256
of organic jerky.

27:37.289 --> 27:38.991
- He doesn't deserve
a life like this.

27:39.025 --> 27:40.827
- I feel the same way
sometimes, Shawn.

27:45.097 --> 27:47.233
This is a bad idea, Shawn.

27:50.269 --> 27:52.338
*

27:52.371 --> 27:54.340
What the hell?

27:54.373 --> 27:55.975
- Gus, whoever did this,

27:56.008 --> 27:57.443
they have access
to the entirety

27:57.476 --> 27:59.211
of the San Francisco
Police Department.

27:59.245 --> 28:01.480
- Dude, Sam put his name
on his dongle.

28:01.513 --> 28:03.058
- First time that hasn't
been funny to me.

28:03.082 --> 28:04.050
- Eh...
- You're right.

28:04.083 --> 28:06.385
It's not not-funny.

28:12.324 --> 28:14.160
- This is not good, Shawn.

28:14.193 --> 28:16.095
This is all of Juliet's
personal information.

28:16.128 --> 28:18.130
Surveillance photos...
They're spying on her.

28:18.164 --> 28:19.999
- You think she might be next?

28:22.401 --> 28:25.271
This document is called
"The Crimes of Juliet O'Hara."

28:25.304 --> 28:27.106
- Oh, my God.
- I know.

28:27.139 --> 28:28.316
- That's a killer title
for a Hallmark movie.

28:28.340 --> 28:29.942
- Gus, don't be ridiculous.

28:29.976 --> 28:31.477
Jules would never do
a Hallmark movie.

28:31.510 --> 28:33.412
"There's a demon
amongst you"?

28:33.445 --> 28:35.114
"She must be judged."

28:35.147 --> 28:36.348
What?

28:36.382 --> 28:38.117
This manifesto basically
paints her

28:38.150 --> 28:39.919
as Harvey Keitel
from "Cop Land."

28:39.952 --> 28:41.196
- He had an above-ground pool,
Shawn.

28:41.220 --> 28:43.022
- Exactly.
None of this is true.

28:54.033 --> 29:01.173
*

29:01.440 --> 29:02.909
- Anyone expecting a visitor?

29:04.911 --> 29:07.013
Perimeter check, now.

29:07.046 --> 29:09.181
Now!

29:09.882 --> 29:11.426
When I say things,
I want you to do them.

29:11.450 --> 29:12.518
That's why I'm the boss,

29:12.551 --> 29:13.886
and you're my henchpeople.

29:13.920 --> 29:17.256
*

29:17.289 --> 29:19.191
Gus, I got to go back inside.

29:19.225 --> 29:20.426
- What?
- I forgot something.

29:20.459 --> 29:21.928
I'm not going back
alone, Shawn!

29:21.961 --> 29:23.338
- I'll meet you at the car.
- What?!

29:23.362 --> 29:25.197
Shawn!
- Just stick to the road.

29:25.231 --> 29:27.867
Keep clear of the moors!
Beware of the moon, Gus!

29:36.375 --> 29:37.509
Start the car!
Start the car!

29:37.543 --> 29:39.045
Start the car! Start the car!

29:42.314 --> 29:46.052
- Oh, my God,
what are you doing, Shawn?

29:46.085 --> 29:47.595
- I'm naming him Morrissey.
First name Steven.

29:47.619 --> 29:49.255
- I'm not leaving with
that thing, Shawn.

29:49.288 --> 29:50.332
- Fine. I'll drive.
- Wh... argh!

29:50.356 --> 29:51.858
I got it! I got it!

29:51.891 --> 29:53.325
Don't touch that wheel!

29:53.359 --> 29:54.927
Don't touch your wheel!

29:54.961 --> 29:56.271
- It's too late.
I already touched mine.

29:56.295 --> 29:57.372
Ow!
- I know what I'm doing.

29:57.396 --> 29:58.965
Let me...

29:58.998 --> 30:01.367
- Watch out.
- Hold the dog back, Shawn!

30:01.400 --> 30:03.903
- You have a dog in the car.
Look, hands off.

30:03.936 --> 30:05.404
Look what's happening now.

30:05.437 --> 30:07.239
- I got it.
I know what to do, Shawn.

30:07.273 --> 30:09.876
I know what to do.
I got it, Shawn. I got it.

30:09.909 --> 30:11.310
- Are you familiar
with Einstein's

30:11.343 --> 30:12.879
definition of insanity?

30:12.912 --> 30:14.480
- The dog is blocking
my mirror, Shawn.

30:14.513 --> 30:16.382
- Blocking... why are you
using a mirror?

30:16.415 --> 30:18.326
It's pitch black out here.
- Your mama's pitch black.

30:18.350 --> 30:19.585
- We both wish
that were true.

30:19.618 --> 30:21.353
I don't know what
I mean by that.

30:21.387 --> 30:22.998
- Here we go, here we go.
I got it, Shawn.

30:23.022 --> 30:24.456
Bang it out, bang it out.

30:24.490 --> 30:26.258
Come on, Gus,
just bang it out.

30:26.292 --> 30:28.003
Bang it out, bang it out,
bang it out, bang it out.

30:28.027 --> 30:29.962
Bang it out, bang it out,
bang it out.

30:29.996 --> 30:32.899
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.
You should have it on this one.

30:32.932 --> 30:35.367
Okay, one more.
- Come on, come on.

30:35.401 --> 30:36.644
- I can see it, the light
at the end of the tunnel!

30:36.668 --> 30:39.305
- Death to the world!

30:41.007 --> 30:43.475
- I'm glad you could find
a few moments to rest.

30:43.509 --> 30:44.944
Did you find anything?

30:44.977 --> 30:47.379
- I detected the scent
of black cherry,

30:47.413 --> 30:49.415
with a slight hint of chipotle.

30:52.518 --> 30:54.887
- We've been compromised.

30:54.921 --> 30:56.989
So I'm gonna have to speed
things up a little.

30:57.023 --> 31:00.626
And Christmas, my friends,
is about to come a bit early.

31:15.641 --> 31:22.648
*

31:30.656 --> 31:32.024
- No, no, no, Chief!

31:32.058 --> 31:33.625
Don't shoot him!
Don't shoot him!

31:33.659 --> 31:34.937
He's a gift! He's a gift
for you and the family!

31:34.961 --> 31:36.662
- Aww, Mr. Spencer?

31:36.695 --> 31:38.430
What are you doing
at my house

31:38.464 --> 31:41.333
with an attack dog in
the middle of the night?

31:41.367 --> 31:42.668
- First of all, it's,
like, 9:00.

31:42.701 --> 31:44.703
What time do you go
to bed, Chief?

31:44.736 --> 31:46.538
More importantly,

31:46.572 --> 31:48.407
we found Sam Sloane's
assailant.

31:48.440 --> 31:49.952
He is at Sunnyvale
Psychiatric Hospital.

31:49.976 --> 31:51.443
We saw him, or at least
his shadow,

31:51.477 --> 31:53.079
and a couple other
scary shadows.

31:53.112 --> 31:55.547
It was terrifying.
- Well, did he see you?

31:55.581 --> 31:57.192
- Of course not. I'm like
a wraith in a London fog.

31:57.216 --> 31:59.027
- What about when you went
back and stole his dog?

31:59.051 --> 32:02.021
- You stole this dog?
- No. We liberated it.

32:02.054 --> 32:04.356
We liberated Morrissey,
didn't we? Yes, we did.

32:04.390 --> 32:06.625
And now he's yours.
Merry Christmas.

32:06.658 --> 32:08.170
Do you have, like,
a crate or something,

32:08.194 --> 32:09.471
just until he gets over
this whole

32:09.495 --> 32:10.729
attacking strangers thing?

32:18.070 --> 32:19.405
- Why didn't that work for me?

32:19.438 --> 32:20.739
- 'Cause you're
a dumbass, Shawn.

32:20.772 --> 32:22.408
- Did you call O'Hara?
- Of course.

32:22.441 --> 32:23.718
I've been calling her
and texting her.

32:23.742 --> 32:25.044
She's not responding
to anything.

32:25.077 --> 32:26.578
Why do you think we're here?

32:26.612 --> 32:27.755
- You said to gift me
an attack dog.

32:27.779 --> 32:29.081
- Sure, but that's ancillary.

32:29.115 --> 32:30.158
Are you coming with us or not?

32:30.182 --> 32:31.750
- Yes, of course.

32:31.783 --> 32:33.195
- Great. Now, would you
watch a movie of the week

32:33.219 --> 32:34.720
called "The Crimes
of Juliet O'Hara"?

32:38.024 --> 32:39.134
- It's right up here, Chief.

32:39.158 --> 32:40.592
Right through this...

32:45.697 --> 32:48.500
Spanish Prisoner'd again.

32:48.534 --> 32:50.702
Chief, I swear.
You gotta believe us.

32:50.736 --> 32:53.039
There was a whole bank
of monitors here,

32:53.072 --> 32:54.649
and they all had access
to your department's files.

32:54.673 --> 32:56.108
Dude, they're back.

32:56.142 --> 32:57.476
Let's get out of here.

32:57.509 --> 32:59.111
- Get out of here?
- Yes.

32:59.145 --> 33:00.555
- Mr. Guster, this is
my first field action

33:00.579 --> 33:02.214
in two years.

33:02.248 --> 33:04.126
Do you have any idea what
the chief of police does?

33:04.150 --> 33:05.651
- Yeah, they cut
ribbons and stuff.

33:05.684 --> 33:07.119
- Exactly.

33:07.153 --> 33:08.487
It's awful.

33:08.520 --> 33:11.757
So, if you'll excuse me,

33:11.790 --> 33:14.660
I am going to go
shoot some bad guys.

33:14.693 --> 33:17.163
Come on.

33:19.165 --> 33:20.742
- Dude, what is the five-second
rule on...

33:20.766 --> 33:23.669
- Don't. Just don't.

33:27.739 --> 33:29.641
Freeze!

33:29.675 --> 33:31.143
- O'Hara?
- Chief?

33:31.177 --> 33:32.678
- What are you doing here?

33:32.711 --> 33:34.146
- I came here to help
Shawn and Gus.

33:34.180 --> 33:35.681
- Jules, we didn't
report this.

33:35.714 --> 33:38.050
- No, but you ran over
45 traffic cones,

33:38.084 --> 33:39.451
tripped four
silent gate alarms,

33:39.485 --> 33:40.828
and knocked over
a Cal-Trans trailer

33:40.852 --> 33:42.454
while you were
speeding away.

33:42.488 --> 33:43.822
He was driving.

33:43.855 --> 33:45.524
- Okay, they believe that
Inspector Sloane

33:45.557 --> 33:47.193
was attacked
because of you,

33:47.226 --> 33:48.703
and that they found
some rambling manifesto

33:48.727 --> 33:50.196
called "The Juliet
O'Hara Crimes."

33:50.229 --> 33:51.730
- "The Crimes
of Juliet O'Hara."

33:51.763 --> 33:53.832
It sounds like an NBC show
the way you say it.

33:53.865 --> 33:55.201
- Where is this manifesto?

33:55.234 --> 33:56.702
- It's gone.
- Jules,

33:56.735 --> 33:58.637
I've been texting you
and calling you.

33:58.670 --> 34:00.206
Where have you been?

34:00.239 --> 34:01.716
- I asked you guys not
to meddle in this case.

34:01.740 --> 34:03.542
Please, just go home.

34:03.575 --> 34:05.087
You know what? No.
I am done being nice.

34:05.111 --> 34:06.245
Go home!

34:07.213 --> 34:09.148
Please. No. No please.

34:09.181 --> 34:10.625
No please!
You know what?

34:10.649 --> 34:11.859
Just get out of here.
Go to your...

34:11.882 --> 34:14.085
planetarium party.
- Fine with me.

34:14.120 --> 34:15.763
There's a telescope with
my right eye's name on it.

34:15.786 --> 34:17.223
- Yeah, fine.

34:18.357 --> 34:20.592
Just be careful, huh?

34:20.626 --> 34:23.329
Sweetheart.

34:23.362 --> 34:25.563
Your right eye has a name?
- D'Ontario.

34:25.597 --> 34:27.333
- What's the left eye?
- Lisa Lopes.

34:27.366 --> 34:29.601
- Walked right into that.
- You need to tighten it up.

34:32.237 --> 34:34.248
- Okay, what are the chances
that any of these dudes

34:34.273 --> 34:35.741
know how a baby is made?

34:35.774 --> 34:37.842
Hate all you want, Shawn.

34:37.876 --> 34:39.210
But those who look
to the stars

34:39.245 --> 34:41.147
are destined to find...

34:44.916 --> 34:47.786
Oh, my gosh.
- Whoa.

34:47.819 --> 34:49.855
Okay, once and for all,

34:49.888 --> 34:52.224
please explain the thumb
to nostril thing to me.

34:52.257 --> 34:54.126
- It's my battle cry, Shawn.

34:54.159 --> 34:55.902
I'm gonna go over there
and make that woman mine.

34:55.927 --> 34:58.330
It gives me the split second
I need to plan my approach.

34:58.364 --> 35:00.766
- Sure.

35:00.799 --> 35:02.868
- Wait... what is happening?

35:02.901 --> 35:04.536
- I don't know.

35:04.570 --> 35:06.148
It would appear that
she's coming this way.

35:06.172 --> 35:07.215
- Well, that's not right.
Do you know her?

35:07.239 --> 35:08.640
- Why would I know a woman

35:08.674 --> 35:10.152
in a "Nine Planet Solar System"
T-shirt?

35:10.176 --> 35:11.319
- Well, I don't know her,
Shawn,

35:11.343 --> 35:12.311
and she's ruining my approach.

35:12.344 --> 35:13.812
I am the hunter. Me.

35:13.845 --> 35:14.856
Cheetahs don't wait
for gazelles

35:14.880 --> 35:16.382
to hop into their mouth.

35:16.415 --> 35:17.625
- Dude, I think you
might be the gazelle.

35:17.649 --> 35:18.850
- He-dee-ho.
- Hello.

35:18.884 --> 35:20.786
- My name is Burton Guster,

35:20.819 --> 35:22.388
and this is my partner,
White Privilege.

35:22.421 --> 35:24.923
- Eh, that's my bit.
- I'm Selene.

35:24.956 --> 35:27.893
It means "moon."
Is that business card for me?

35:27.926 --> 35:30.362
- You know it is.
Cell number's on the back.

35:30.396 --> 35:32.831
In pencil.

35:32.864 --> 35:34.666
- Wanna look?

35:34.700 --> 35:37.836
- I was hoping you'd never ask.

35:37.869 --> 35:40.172
- Well, that didn't
come out right.

35:46.678 --> 35:47.813
- Chief, I'm a good cop.

35:47.846 --> 35:49.415
- You're the best cop I have.

35:49.448 --> 35:51.683
- I may have an idea
who did this,

35:51.717 --> 35:53.919
but I am the only one
who can fix it.

35:53.952 --> 35:55.321
I need to go it alone.

35:55.354 --> 35:56.922
- The answer to that is no.

35:56.955 --> 35:58.790
- I wish I could be more
forthcoming with you,

35:58.824 --> 36:02.261
but Chief, I need you
to trust me.

36:02.294 --> 36:03.862
Please.

36:06.465 --> 36:08.300
- You have 24 hours.

36:08.334 --> 36:09.968
- If Sam wakes up,
I'll only need 12.

36:10.001 --> 36:11.837
I'm going to the hospital.

36:20.879 --> 36:23.782
- That's where it would be,
planet number nine.

36:23.815 --> 36:27.719
Obviously, if this telescope
were powerful enough.

36:27.753 --> 36:31.290
- I hate to correct you,
but Pluto's way over there.

36:31.323 --> 36:33.259
- Why would I be
pointing it at Pluto?

36:33.292 --> 36:34.802
- 'Cause you're showing me
the ninth planet.

36:34.826 --> 36:37.629
- Yes. I'm showing you Eris.

36:37.663 --> 36:38.930
- Eris?

36:38.964 --> 36:40.299
The dwarf planet?

36:42.901 --> 36:44.770
Eris is stupid.

36:44.803 --> 36:46.981
Pluto is, has been, and will
always be the ninth planet.

36:47.005 --> 36:49.241
- Why would we make
Pluto a planet again?

36:49.275 --> 36:51.910
We've already rectified
that mistake.

36:51.943 --> 36:53.979
- "Mistake"?

36:54.012 --> 36:56.014
Hasn't Pluto been through
enough already?

36:56.047 --> 36:57.449
- Ohh...

36:57.483 --> 37:00.486
- Eris is bigger.
- By 15 miles.

37:00.519 --> 37:02.988
By your logic, why don't we
make everything a planet?

37:03.021 --> 37:04.890
Why don't we make
that Nativity Jesus a planet?

37:04.923 --> 37:06.758
- Why don't we make
your forehead a planet?

37:06.792 --> 37:08.794
- What?

37:11.863 --> 37:13.765
- * Merry Christmas,
merry Christmas *

37:13.799 --> 37:15.443
* But I think I'll miss
this one this year *

37:17.503 --> 37:19.805
- * But I think I'll miss
this one this year *

37:19.838 --> 37:22.808
* Merry Christmas,
merry Christmas *

37:26.077 --> 37:27.913
- Did I read that
situation incorrectly?

37:30.782 --> 37:32.284
- Come on, son.

37:33.485 --> 37:35.787
We're leaving? Are you crazy?

37:35.821 --> 37:38.021
That's probably your best
chance ever at finding a wife!

37:44.062 --> 37:46.798
- Wheelchair to Admitting.

37:46.832 --> 37:50.302
We need a wheelchair at
Admitting please.

37:50.336 --> 37:53.305
- We need to clear
this area now, go.

37:56.742 --> 38:03.749
*

38:31.777 --> 38:33.017
- I'm so sorry about the delay.

38:34.145 --> 38:36.114
The forensic report
was right here,

38:36.147 --> 38:37.725
and somehow, my new assistant
managed to lose it already.

38:37.749 --> 38:40.719
- Found it!
Oh, false alarm.

38:40.752 --> 38:43.121
This is actually the new issue
of "Men's Health."

38:43.154 --> 38:45.857
Wow, Ryan Reynolds
is more jacked than ever.

38:45.891 --> 38:47.859
You know, I used to be
a personal trainer.

38:47.893 --> 38:49.127
Oh. Hi, Shawn.

38:53.632 --> 38:55.734
*

38:56.768 --> 38:58.136
- Oh, my God.

38:58.169 --> 39:00.939
- Yeah. Woody, what are
you doing here?

39:00.972 --> 39:02.107
- What? Don't look at me.

39:02.140 --> 39:03.775
- I can explain.

39:03.809 --> 39:06.144
Thank God Karen
and Butterfly here

39:06.177 --> 39:08.614
have hearts the size
of Anchorage.

39:08.647 --> 39:09.915
- I voted no.

39:11.750 --> 39:13.785
She's so saucy.
I can't take it sometimes.

39:15.186 --> 39:17.556
This is called an NBA hug.

39:17.589 --> 39:18.890
- Let's call it one-and-done.

39:18.924 --> 39:20.692
- Copy that.

39:20.726 --> 39:22.003
- Seriously, man,
what the hell happened?

39:22.027 --> 39:23.695
You were... you were
in Sacramento.

39:23.729 --> 39:25.731
You had season tickets
to the Kings.

39:25.764 --> 39:28.900
- Yeah, I got the gig
as head medical examiner

39:28.934 --> 39:30.636
for the State of California.

39:30.669 --> 39:32.671
Lassiter threw me a party
at Buca di Bepo.

39:32.704 --> 39:34.606
I got a condo with
a Japanese bidet

39:34.640 --> 39:37.042
in both bathrooms and a urinal
in the foyer.

39:37.075 --> 39:39.645
Mm. Those were halcyon times.

39:39.678 --> 39:41.647
- Then he got fired
for closing up a cadaver

39:41.680 --> 39:43.882
with a chili dog
in the chest cavity.

39:43.915 --> 39:46.785
- Not... true.

39:46.818 --> 39:48.620
Butterfly.

39:48.654 --> 39:50.097
I got fired for opening
the cadaver back up

39:50.121 --> 39:51.823
to retrieve the chili dog

39:51.857 --> 39:55.727
because I took a working lunch.
- Ohh.

39:55.761 --> 39:57.095
- Wow.
- Yup.

39:57.128 --> 39:59.164
- But hey, here we all are.

39:59.197 --> 40:00.966
It's like no time
has passed at all.

40:00.999 --> 40:03.134
Look at you guys.
Look at me.

40:03.168 --> 40:04.936
I have hemorrhoids.

40:04.970 --> 40:06.938
Thrombosis.
But they make pillows for that.

40:06.972 --> 40:09.140
- Far be it for me to rain
on this reunion,

40:09.174 --> 40:10.842
but could you please
shed some light

40:10.876 --> 40:13.078
on the murder of my partner?

40:13.111 --> 40:15.647
- Yes.

40:15.681 --> 40:17.683
I can tell you he was
asphyxiated.

40:17.716 --> 40:18.950
My guess is with a pillow.

40:18.984 --> 40:20.719
We're combing the body for DNA.

40:20.752 --> 40:22.988
At this point, I can say
with 100% certainty...

40:23.021 --> 40:25.156
- Burton Guster?

40:25.190 --> 40:26.658
- What the...

40:29.060 --> 40:32.130
- So anyone can come in
to the morgue now.

40:32.163 --> 40:33.765
Cool.

40:33.799 --> 40:34.909
- So weird.
What are the odds?

40:34.933 --> 40:36.968
How have you been?

40:37.002 --> 40:38.704
Is that a dead body?

40:38.737 --> 40:39.771
- Yeah.

40:39.805 --> 40:41.640
- Uh, so,

40:41.673 --> 40:43.751
I was hoping to explain myself
from our date last night.

40:43.775 --> 40:45.711
- That wasn't a date.
That was an assault.

40:45.744 --> 40:46.945
Do you work here?

40:46.978 --> 40:48.714
- Ew, no.
This place is gross.

40:48.747 --> 40:49.857
But I did see
your cute Instagram post,

40:49.881 --> 40:51.049
and I thought I'd pop by.

40:51.082 --> 40:52.818
- You Instagrammed the morgue?

40:52.851 --> 40:53.819
- I have followers
to think about, Shawn.

40:53.852 --> 40:55.754
Excuse me.

40:58.156 --> 40:59.791
- Who is this?

40:59.825 --> 41:01.235
- That's the girl from
the telescope party.

41:01.259 --> 41:03.161
- Oh, I'm so glad that
she's here with us.

41:04.863 --> 41:06.131
- Okay, yeah...
- Shh.

41:06.164 --> 41:08.099
Listen. I'ma be honest
with you, Burton.

41:08.133 --> 41:11.102
I am an ambitious woman with
a lot to do in my life.

41:11.136 --> 41:12.938
I don't have time
to mess around.

41:12.971 --> 41:15.082
I took your business card,
and I did my due diligence.

41:15.106 --> 41:16.942
I checked you out
on Linkedln,

41:16.975 --> 41:18.744
Classmates.com,
BlackPlanet...

41:18.777 --> 41:19.887
- BlackPlanet?
- I got a friend.

41:19.911 --> 41:21.279
The point is, you passed.

41:21.312 --> 41:22.781
- Passed what?
- All of it.

41:22.814 --> 41:24.215
All of it.

41:24.249 --> 41:26.752
I choose you.
I choose you, Burton Guster.

41:26.785 --> 41:28.930
- Is there a world in which I
walk you through what I was

41:28.954 --> 41:30.832
doing when you guys got here?
- Please. I'm begging you.

41:30.856 --> 41:32.758
- All right, so...

41:32.791 --> 41:34.936
Wait, there... there's something
lodged in the stomach.

41:34.960 --> 41:36.795
She's not great.

41:36.828 --> 41:37.896
- You don't even know me.

41:37.929 --> 41:39.230
- I know all I need to know.

41:39.264 --> 41:41.166
You like the sky, your mother,
safecracking,

41:41.199 --> 41:43.669
a bakery called
Boom Boom Boom Muffins.

41:43.702 --> 41:44.946
- That's all
on my business card.

41:44.970 --> 41:46.280
- I know when you were
eight years old,

41:46.304 --> 41:47.973
you won a contest for
doing a comic strip

41:48.006 --> 41:50.041
about an Egyptian dog
that became Pharaoh.

41:50.075 --> 41:52.177
- You know about
Mesopotamian Pomeranian?

41:52.210 --> 41:54.212
- I wish I
would've known you then.

41:54.245 --> 41:57.115
I bet you were a dead ringer
for Bud on "The Cosby Show."

41:58.917 --> 42:00.786
Look, you can't
follow me around,

42:00.819 --> 42:02.788
research me, try to kiss me,

42:02.821 --> 42:05.724
sniff my head, make me
feel uncomfortable...

42:05.757 --> 42:08.035
- He's literally done all those
things since Thanksgiving.

42:08.059 --> 42:10.228
- He's getting Gussed.
No wonder he doesn't like it.

42:10.261 --> 42:12.831
- And yes, maybe your lips
are warm and soft

42:12.864 --> 42:14.800
and taste like caramel,

42:14.833 --> 42:16.944
but those lips are wrapped in
an electric blanket of crazy

42:16.968 --> 42:18.203
set to medium-high,

42:18.236 --> 42:19.346
and it doesn't
give you the right

42:19.370 --> 42:21.807
to invade my private cone.

42:21.840 --> 42:23.341
- Hm. Completely fair.

42:23.374 --> 42:25.811
- Hm.
- I will leave you my resume.

42:25.844 --> 42:26.878
- Your resume?

42:26.912 --> 42:28.113
- Yes... my romantic history,

42:28.146 --> 42:29.815
a few references.

42:29.848 --> 42:31.292
I think you'll see I
check out quite nicely,

42:31.316 --> 42:34.119
save possibly for a brief
dalliance with Lester Holt

42:34.152 --> 42:37.155
and a semi-public rock-out
with Wilmer Valderrama,

42:37.188 --> 42:38.957
but to be completely fair,

42:38.990 --> 42:40.191
it was all under the shirt

42:40.225 --> 42:41.727
but over the bra.

42:41.760 --> 42:43.094
Oh, and I also made you

42:43.128 --> 42:44.362
this fluffernutter sandwich.

42:44.395 --> 42:47.799
Your mother said it
was your favorite.

42:47.833 --> 42:49.367
So, there you have it.

42:49.400 --> 42:51.903
- I'm gonna keep this
fluffernutter sandwich,

42:51.937 --> 42:53.972
because I think it's rude
to waste food.

42:54.005 --> 42:55.741
- I will circle back with you

42:55.774 --> 42:57.351
once you've had a chance
to look over my materials.

42:57.375 --> 43:00.111
But in the meantime...

43:00.145 --> 43:01.913
get out!
- What?

43:01.947 --> 43:04.349
You know, like the movie.

43:04.382 --> 43:06.084
Okay, bye.

43:06.117 --> 43:09.087
You know what?
I'm gonna go.

43:13.191 --> 43:14.926
- Oh, well, this is new.

43:14.960 --> 43:15.994
- I know that dongle.

43:18.263 --> 43:19.765
- Let's hope it still works.

43:19.798 --> 43:23.034
- Mine does not.
Not always.

43:28.373 --> 43:30.051
- You should at least try
that sandwich, yeah?

43:30.075 --> 43:31.843
- Get your own stalker, Shawn.

43:33.211 --> 43:34.813
- Ugh.

43:34.846 --> 43:36.848
It's completely wiped.
- Wait.

43:36.882 --> 43:38.984
There's one file added
after the wipe.

43:42.020 --> 43:47.993
*

43:48.026 --> 43:49.895
- I don't know what
to tell you, Gus.

43:49.928 --> 43:51.205
She took the file; she won't
show me the document.

43:51.229 --> 43:52.964
I'm freaking out.
I mean, what if I'm

43:52.998 --> 43:54.408
sleeping with Nick Nolte
from "Mulholland Falls"?

43:54.432 --> 43:56.267
- Well, then you're
really getting

43:56.301 --> 43:58.904
the short end of the stick,
"Mulholland Falls" -wise.

44:03.942 --> 44:05.243
- You know, it's funny.

44:05.276 --> 44:06.912
When people steal from me,

44:06.945 --> 44:08.880
they tend to run
much farther away.

44:08.914 --> 44:10.248
- All right, all right.

44:10.281 --> 44:11.883
Let's all be reasonable here.

44:11.917 --> 44:13.351
He didn't mean
to steal from you.

44:13.384 --> 44:15.186
He was just working a case.

44:15.220 --> 44:17.355
- A case?
Who do you work for?

44:19.124 --> 44:20.826
- I can't tell you that.

44:20.859 --> 44:22.994
- Oh, boy. Shawn,
tell the man with the knife

44:23.028 --> 44:24.095
who the client is.

44:24.129 --> 44:26.231
- Ohhhh,

44:26.264 --> 44:28.099
I'm afraid I'm gonna have
to invoke, uh,

44:28.133 --> 44:29.300
detective-client privilege.

44:29.334 --> 44:31.336
- Who's the damn client, Shawn?

44:31.369 --> 44:33.338
- I...

44:33.371 --> 44:34.940
it's me.

44:34.973 --> 44:36.341
It's me. I'm the client.

44:36.374 --> 44:39.410
I am looking for
an engagement ring.

44:39.444 --> 44:42.480
It's my ring, and it was stolen
from me while I was proposing.

44:42.513 --> 44:45.316
- Are you kidding me?!

44:45.350 --> 44:47.418
This guy... this guy right here...

44:47.452 --> 44:49.120
He has ruined our business

44:49.154 --> 44:50.956
because he keeps searching
for this damn ring

44:50.989 --> 44:52.123
that he's never gonna find!

44:52.157 --> 44:54.125
- Not true, Gus!

44:54.159 --> 44:55.994
May I just...

44:56.027 --> 44:57.062
- I'm telling you, Shawn,

44:57.095 --> 44:58.429
that ring is cursed!

44:58.463 --> 45:01.867
- This ring is the opposite
of cursed.

45:01.900 --> 45:04.335
Here it is. And I cannot
get married without it, sir.

45:04.369 --> 45:06.104
- This ring is worthless.
- To you.

45:06.137 --> 45:08.039
Sure. But to me,
it's everything.

45:08.073 --> 45:09.474
- You ever considered that

45:09.507 --> 45:11.176
maybe you're just
using the ring

45:11.209 --> 45:14.079
as an excuse to cover
your fear of change?

45:14.112 --> 45:16.081
- Thank you.
That's exactly what...

45:18.149 --> 45:21.086
- This isn't about you.
- Got it.

45:21.119 --> 45:22.387
Please continue.

45:22.420 --> 45:24.055
- The ring was
my grandmother's.

45:24.089 --> 45:25.399
Right? It was supposed
to go to my dad,

45:25.423 --> 45:27.025
But they often butted heads.

45:27.058 --> 45:28.102
On the night before
his wedding,

45:28.126 --> 45:29.227
she pulls the ring back.

45:29.260 --> 45:30.261
So he had to scramble,

45:30.295 --> 45:32.130
and he went into debt,

45:32.163 --> 45:33.932
made a bunch of very poor
financial decisions

45:33.965 --> 45:35.500
which ultimately resulted
in a divorce,

45:35.533 --> 45:38.937
because he didn't
have that ring.

45:38.970 --> 45:41.239
It's possible that I'm
editorializing,

45:41.272 --> 45:43.374
but I'm not gonna make
the same mistake.

45:45.110 --> 45:47.478
- Thank you for the answer.

45:49.447 --> 45:50.916
Kill them.

45:50.949 --> 45:52.250
- No, no! You can't kill us!

45:52.283 --> 45:54.152
You can't kill us!
We just bonded!

45:54.185 --> 45:56.163
You and me, like gentlemen.
- Business is business.

45:56.187 --> 46:00.025
Plus, you now know that
my real name is Ted.

46:01.559 --> 46:03.428
- Only because
you just told me.

46:03.461 --> 46:05.172
- I'm sorry about this,
but no one's going to miss

46:05.196 --> 46:06.531
some lowly private detective.

46:06.564 --> 46:09.500
- Time out.
Lowly? No.

46:09.534 --> 46:12.503
I'll have you know I am the
preeminent psychic detective

46:12.537 --> 46:14.572
in this whole alley, Jack.

46:14.605 --> 46:16.441
- Psychic?

46:16.474 --> 46:17.943
- That's right.

46:17.976 --> 46:19.277
Please, take a look.

46:22.513 --> 46:24.249
That's me, with the sweet hair.

46:24.282 --> 46:25.592
- This makes no sense.
Why does a psychic

46:25.616 --> 46:27.218
operate in the shop
from "Gremlins"?

46:27.252 --> 46:30.221
- To potentially
meet Phoebe Cates.

46:33.091 --> 46:35.360
- Okay.

46:35.393 --> 46:37.195
Read me.

46:37.228 --> 46:39.097
- Read you.

46:53.611 --> 46:55.113
Covfefe.

46:56.514 --> 46:58.383
You like knives.

46:58.416 --> 47:00.986
You like kittens.

47:01.019 --> 47:02.520
You like...

47:02.553 --> 47:05.290
Middle-aged... kittens.

47:05.323 --> 47:06.992
- Mm-hmm. The past.

47:07.025 --> 47:09.327
Anyone can read the past.

47:09.360 --> 47:10.528
- I got the kittens right?

47:12.030 --> 47:13.398
- Tell me the future.

47:13.431 --> 47:15.266
- Look.

47:15.300 --> 47:17.235
Gus, he has own Ta-rote cards.

47:17.268 --> 47:18.503
- Tarot cards.

47:18.536 --> 47:20.205
- He just carries them
around with him.

47:20.238 --> 47:21.639
That's not scary at all.

47:21.672 --> 47:23.308
Shall we adjourn

47:23.341 --> 47:25.410
to the Mahjong Room?

47:29.547 --> 47:36.487
*

48:02.313 --> 48:04.549
The Merle of Haggard.

48:04.582 --> 48:06.217
- Merle of what?

48:06.251 --> 48:09.054
- He foretells
of a dangerous situation.

48:09.087 --> 48:11.556
It involves both a curb

48:11.589 --> 48:13.258
and a bus.

48:18.729 --> 48:20.665
I see a tax issue.
- I don't pay taxes.

48:20.698 --> 48:22.567
- That's the issue.

48:28.339 --> 48:29.440
Sorry.

48:29.474 --> 48:30.508
Forgive me.

48:30.541 --> 48:32.543
You must lay off the salt.

48:32.577 --> 48:34.112
- Salt?
- Salt.

48:34.145 --> 48:36.381
- Salt.
- Salt.

48:36.414 --> 48:37.615
Gus...

48:39.550 --> 48:41.652
- Okay. All right.

48:41.686 --> 48:44.289
- So you're not
gonna cleave us?

48:44.322 --> 48:46.724
- We'll see, won't we?

49:01.506 --> 49:08.446
*

49:10.381 --> 49:13.184
- Uh...

49:13.218 --> 49:14.485
how we doing, babe?

49:14.519 --> 49:16.354
- Shawn, I owe you an apology.

49:16.387 --> 49:18.389
I know I have been
acting strange

49:18.423 --> 49:19.590
and icing you out,

49:19.624 --> 49:21.526
but the truth is,

49:21.559 --> 49:24.362
I'm scared, and I
need your help.

49:24.395 --> 49:26.697
- You had us at Shawn.

49:26.731 --> 49:29.734
- I used all of the cases
referenced in this manifesto

49:29.767 --> 49:31.369
to create this board.

49:31.402 --> 49:33.371
It is every suspect
that went away

49:33.404 --> 49:35.073
for every crime mentioned.

49:35.106 --> 49:37.442
- So these are the victims
of your supposed crimes?

49:37.475 --> 49:39.744
- Yes. Now, I know,
what you're thinking.

49:39.777 --> 49:41.079
And here's the thing.

49:42.480 --> 49:44.515
It's true.

49:44.549 --> 49:47.118
Look, every single one
of these dirtbags

49:47.152 --> 49:48.686
is guilty as sin.

49:48.719 --> 49:51.089
But I have done some things

49:51.122 --> 49:54.392
that I am not necessarily
proud of.

49:56.194 --> 49:57.762
I've to pee since 2:00.

49:57.795 --> 49:59.540
- Gus, it's 2:05.
- It doesn't matter, Shawn.

49:59.564 --> 50:01.166
- It does matter.
We stopped specifically

50:01.199 --> 50:02.509
on the way here so that
you could go pee.

50:02.533 --> 50:04.102
- There was someone in there.

50:04.135 --> 50:05.546
- There were 12 stalls.
- I don't care.

50:05.570 --> 50:06.680
- When are you gonna get
a handle on this

50:06.704 --> 50:08.073
bashful black bladder thing?

50:08.106 --> 50:09.440
- You know what?
Do you, Shawn.

50:11.742 --> 50:12.810
- I...

50:12.843 --> 50:14.745
I fudged the rules.

50:14.779 --> 50:17.515
I skipped some protocols to put
these dirtbags away, Shawn.

50:17.548 --> 50:20.085
And now I feel like Sam's blood
is on my hands,

50:20.118 --> 50:21.786
and I have no one to blame
but myself.

50:21.819 --> 50:22.787
- Hey, hey, hey.

50:22.820 --> 50:25.223
I love these hands.

50:25.256 --> 50:27.525
Especially the right one,
because that's the one

50:27.558 --> 50:28.793
I generally hold.

50:28.826 --> 50:30.061
- I...

50:30.095 --> 50:31.496
I like to walk on the left.

50:31.529 --> 50:32.573
- You do like to walk
on the left.

50:32.597 --> 50:33.664
You're a leftie walker.

50:33.698 --> 50:35.533
They call that southfoot.

50:35.566 --> 50:37.168
- I'm a southfoot.
- You're a southfoot.

50:37.202 --> 50:39.070
Look, you have watched me

50:39.104 --> 50:40.738
lie and cheat and steal

50:40.771 --> 50:42.540
for the better part of what,
a decade?

50:42.573 --> 50:45.476
All in the name
of catching bad guys.

50:45.510 --> 50:47.612
You didn't do anything
illegal, am I right?

50:48.846 --> 50:51.449
Then let's figure out who
the hell is doing this to you,

50:51.482 --> 50:53.050
and put 'em away.

50:56.887 --> 50:58.589
This is work time.

50:58.623 --> 51:00.158
- Okay.

51:00.191 --> 51:02.760
All of these criminals
had a beef...

51:02.793 --> 51:05.130
A technicality they
hoped would get them off.

51:05.163 --> 51:06.831
The problem is that
none of them

51:06.864 --> 51:09.134
should feel more slighted
than the other.

51:09.167 --> 51:11.202
It's impossible to know
who is Sam's killer.

51:14.172 --> 51:21.179
*

51:30.755 --> 51:31.798
- 'Cause it's none of them.

51:31.822 --> 51:33.558
It's none of the perps.

51:35.593 --> 51:37.094
It's your snitch.

51:40.831 --> 51:42.633
- Billy McGoldrick?

51:44.335 --> 51:45.870
He gave information
on all of them.

51:45.903 --> 51:47.838
- What's his beef?

51:47.872 --> 51:49.740
- I still sent him to jail.

51:49.774 --> 51:51.542
- Well, obviously he's out.

51:51.576 --> 51:53.216
And he's the one who's
been following you.

51:55.913 --> 51:58.149
- Surveillance photos?
They're spying on her.

51:59.850 --> 52:01.752
- Jules...

52:01.786 --> 52:04.622
your house keys
were in your hand.

52:04.655 --> 52:06.624
That picture was taken
from here, Gus.

52:09.294 --> 52:10.628
Wait.

52:15.666 --> 52:17.626
Ah, no, actually, the picture
was taken from ac...

52:24.909 --> 52:26.811
*

52:28.679 --> 52:29.780
- I'll be damned.

52:29.814 --> 52:31.249
- That's him!

52:37.788 --> 52:38.823
Freeze!

52:41.859 --> 52:47.865
*

52:50.268 --> 52:52.703
- You betrayed me
and ruined my life!

52:55.706 --> 52:56.983
- You were a snitch
and a criminal!

52:57.007 --> 52:58.576
Of course she sold you out!

52:58.609 --> 52:59.686
- Guys...
- And you killed Sam,

52:59.710 --> 53:00.878
you son of a bitch!

53:00.911 --> 53:02.780
- Yeah!
- Oh... oh, come on.

53:02.813 --> 53:04.291
Sammy's not even d...
Oh, bloody hell, he is dead.

53:04.315 --> 53:05.983
Well, look, I wish
I'd killed him!

53:06.016 --> 53:08.319
But that honor went to
my beautiful new associate...

53:08.353 --> 53:09.620
- Heather Rockrear.

53:09.654 --> 53:10.988
- Heather Rockrear?

53:11.021 --> 53:12.757
- What? That's what
we're calling her.

53:12.790 --> 53:14.692
And the brother's the Black
Gentleman Dandy.

53:14.725 --> 53:16.237
- That's correct, Gus.
And you're the Thin White Duke!

53:16.261 --> 53:17.928
- You're spot on.

53:17.962 --> 53:19.830
- Eh, well...

53:19.864 --> 53:21.632
- What?

53:21.666 --> 53:22.976
- Look, man, I hate
to break it to you.

53:23.000 --> 53:24.835
You don't sound anything
like David Bowie.

53:24.869 --> 53:26.971
- No.
- Well, hang on.

53:27.004 --> 53:28.982
Nobody sounds like David Bowie
but David Bowie, full stop.

53:29.006 --> 53:31.709
- Well, I think Jemaine Clement
has a pretty good Bowie.

53:31.742 --> 53:33.244
- Yup.
- Look, psychic boy

53:33.278 --> 53:34.812
and Magic Head,

53:34.845 --> 53:36.714
Juliet, I would love to kill
all three of you

53:36.747 --> 53:38.316
right now, but unfortunately,

53:38.349 --> 53:39.893
I've already promised I won't
do that yet.

53:39.917 --> 53:40.985
And unlike you,

53:41.018 --> 53:42.720
I keep my promises.

53:48.926 --> 53:50.728
- Promises?
What are you talking about?

53:50.761 --> 53:52.763
- Oh, come on, Jack.
Let's not ruin the ending.

53:52.797 --> 53:54.365
- Hey!

53:54.399 --> 53:55.676
I'll be doing all the
jack-tagging around here,

53:55.700 --> 53:56.734
okay, Jack?

53:56.767 --> 53:58.369
- Drop the gun!

54:02.773 --> 54:04.809
- Nice, babe.
That's nice. That's clean.

54:04.842 --> 54:07.345
- I have just one thing
to say...

54:07.378 --> 54:10.315
always have a plan B.

54:13.050 --> 54:14.251
Ha!

54:19.390 --> 54:20.901
- That couldn't have been
what you were going for.

54:20.925 --> 54:22.460
You check the batteries
in the remote?

54:22.493 --> 54:23.994
- Bloody hell.
Uh, the plan was,

54:24.028 --> 54:25.763
I was gonna do a flippy-do
into here,

54:25.796 --> 54:27.765
hit the button,
massive metal door

54:27.798 --> 54:29.400
just like, sha-kunks down.

54:29.434 --> 54:31.302
You know, like in
"Empire Strikes Back."

54:31.336 --> 54:33.504
Now it's busted, and I'm
really embarrassed.

54:33.538 --> 54:34.981
- You have the right
to remain silent.

54:35.005 --> 54:36.273
- Yahtzee!

54:38.509 --> 54:39.910
- Wait!

54:41.846 --> 54:44.382
Damn it, we walked
right into that.

54:44.415 --> 54:45.683
It was kinda dope, though.

54:45.716 --> 54:47.051
- Let's go.
- Yeah.

54:53.424 --> 54:55.360
- Lord, I'm gonna pay
a steep price

54:55.393 --> 54:57.728
for what I'm about
to do to my body.

54:57.762 --> 55:00.931
- Hey, Gus, come check out
this douchebag in the hat.

55:01.799 --> 55:03.901
- Shawn!

55:03.934 --> 55:05.803
- Oh, my God.

55:05.836 --> 55:08.706
My dad's having a full-on
seven-eighths life crisis.

55:08.739 --> 55:10.074
Dad, I specifically told you

55:10.107 --> 55:11.409
to dress for dinner,

55:11.442 --> 55:12.843
not Adam Levine's funeral.

55:12.877 --> 55:14.479
- I'm allowed to evolve, Shawn.

55:14.512 --> 55:15.713
- Is that scarf tweed?

55:15.746 --> 55:16.881
- I'll be honest, Pop.

55:16.914 --> 55:17.958
I have been actively shopping

55:17.982 --> 55:19.850
for a walk-in tub

55:19.884 --> 55:21.924
and something called a Rascal
for you for Christmas.

55:21.952 --> 55:23.864
There is no way that you think
this outfit is appropriate.

55:23.888 --> 55:25.956
- Shawn, exactly how old
do you think I am?

55:25.990 --> 55:27.992
- I know it starts with one.

55:28.025 --> 55:30.070
- Yep, it's definitely tweed.
- Why do you own a ukulele?

55:30.094 --> 55:32.062
- Would you please stay out
of my stuff,

55:32.096 --> 55:33.998
and if you must know,

55:34.031 --> 55:35.842
I recently learned "The Remedy"
from Oliver and Angus.

55:35.866 --> 55:38.068
- Oliver and Angus?

55:38.102 --> 55:40.438
- Yes, they work at FOMO
next to my loft building.

55:40.471 --> 55:41.739
- Did you hear that, Gus?

55:41.772 --> 55:43.474
Oliver and Angus work at FOMO.

55:44.842 --> 55:46.477
What... I saw you
five months ago.

55:46.511 --> 55:48.446
What happened?
- I bought my retirement loft

55:48.479 --> 55:50.515
with an unobstructed view
of my boat.

55:50.548 --> 55:51.992
I did not plan that the area
would gentrify

55:52.016 --> 55:53.851
as quickly as it did,

55:53.884 --> 55:55.596
but rather than getting all
Scroogey about it,

55:55.620 --> 55:57.955
I stayed fluid.

55:57.988 --> 55:59.866
- Show me your belly button
and prove you're my father.

55:59.890 --> 56:01.392
- Man, some of us are eating.

56:02.893 --> 56:03.861
- Hey, Juliet.

56:03.894 --> 56:06.096
- Henry.

56:06.130 --> 56:07.465
What a surprise.

56:07.498 --> 56:08.966
- Um...
- Hey.

56:08.999 --> 56:10.076
If somebody makes my
future daughter-in-law

56:10.100 --> 56:11.602
a target, you can bet your ass

56:11.636 --> 56:13.137
I'm not staying home
for Christmas,

56:13.170 --> 56:16.173
plus there's a drum circle
down at Union Square

56:16.206 --> 56:18.042
that I'm already
kinda committed to.

56:18.075 --> 56:20.044
- Is this a cricket bat?

56:20.077 --> 56:21.546
- You should've stayed home.

56:21.579 --> 56:23.089
Whatever this psycho
McGoldrick is up to,

56:23.113 --> 56:25.450
he wants me, not you...
Any of you.

56:25.483 --> 56:27.060
- McGoldrick? The ginger
who works at the baths

56:27.084 --> 56:29.019
down at the Funkzone,
he's behind all this?

56:29.053 --> 56:30.588
- No, Dad.
Not that McGoldrick.

56:30.621 --> 56:32.557
This one's one of Juliet's
snitches.

56:32.590 --> 56:33.900
Said he promised someone else
he wasn't gonna kill her,

56:33.924 --> 56:35.960
so the question's who and why.

56:35.993 --> 56:37.194
- Puts us back
to square one.

56:37.227 --> 56:39.497
Countless perps
with axes to grind.

56:39.530 --> 56:41.031
- Yeah, but he knows
who we are too.

56:41.065 --> 56:42.933
That rapscallion
called me Magic Head.

56:42.967 --> 56:44.447
- Well, he picked on
the wrong family.

56:50.508 --> 56:52.109
- Shawn, that would be
your cue.

56:52.142 --> 56:53.644
- Yeah, I know my cue, Pop.

56:53.678 --> 56:55.513
This isn't 2010, okay?

56:55.546 --> 56:57.181
I can read my own
girlfriend.

56:57.214 --> 56:58.659
I know when she needs to be
comforted, et cetera.

56:58.683 --> 57:00.150
- Fiancé.
- That's what I said.

57:00.184 --> 57:01.919
- No. You said girlfriend.

57:01.952 --> 57:04.021
- It's semantics.
- It's not semantics, Shawn.

57:04.054 --> 57:05.656
- Y...

57:05.690 --> 57:07.992
you ate all the Quatro
Quesos Dos Fritos?!

57:08.025 --> 57:10.427
- Yes, and now I pray for dawn.

57:12.229 --> 57:14.031
- It's my problem, Shawn.

57:14.064 --> 57:15.842
- Sweetheart, you keep
saying that; it's ridiculous.

57:15.866 --> 57:17.478
Since when is a psychopath
trying to kill you

57:17.502 --> 57:18.936
just your problem?

57:18.969 --> 57:20.113
- It's more complicated
than that.

57:20.137 --> 57:21.672
- It's not. It's... it's not.

57:21.706 --> 57:23.216
And it's certainly
not more complicated

57:23.240 --> 57:24.585
than me designing
the psychphrancisco office

57:24.609 --> 57:26.611
with a "Gremlins" motif.

57:26.644 --> 57:29.046
And you signed off
when no one else would.

57:29.079 --> 57:30.581
No one else got it.

57:30.615 --> 57:32.149
Except for you.

57:32.182 --> 57:35.219
You always have my back.

57:35.252 --> 57:36.987
Because that's how we do it.

57:37.021 --> 57:40.090
We take on these...
These crazy obstacles, right?

57:40.124 --> 57:42.993
And... and we come at it together
and we work through it,

57:43.027 --> 57:44.061
because we are an us.

57:44.094 --> 57:45.062
We are a we.

57:45.095 --> 57:46.497
We are... we are lovers

57:46.531 --> 57:47.698
in the nighttime.

57:47.732 --> 57:50.535
- Are we? Do we?
Should we?

57:50.568 --> 57:53.203
- I don't know, you're...
You're Dr. Suessing me now.

57:53.237 --> 57:55.015
I don't even know... what am I
supposed to do with that?

57:55.039 --> 57:57.107
- Sorry, I'm just really
wound up right now.

57:57.141 --> 57:59.243
- Maybe...

57:59.276 --> 58:01.946
I should help you unwind.

58:01.979 --> 58:03.581
Huh? Maybe?

58:03.614 --> 58:05.249
Maybe a little bit of bacon?

58:05.282 --> 58:08.519
That's very sweet of you.

58:09.954 --> 58:11.594
But I'm gonna go outside
and get some air.

58:12.289 --> 58:13.891
- Okay.

58:13.924 --> 58:16.126
- You should try
to get some sleep.

58:23.568 --> 58:24.735
*

58:30.174 --> 58:31.141
- Hey there, partner.

58:31.175 --> 58:32.577
- Hey, Carlton.

58:32.610 --> 58:34.111
I'm sorry to bother you
so late.

58:34.144 --> 58:35.946
- I talked to Henry.

58:35.980 --> 58:37.648
I'm so sorry to hear
about Sam.

58:37.682 --> 58:39.617
- It was my fault, Carlton.

58:39.650 --> 58:41.218
- I highly doubt that.

58:41.251 --> 58:42.753
- No, it was.

58:42.787 --> 58:44.989
I colored outside the lines.

58:45.022 --> 58:46.624
- I see.

58:46.657 --> 58:48.626
But I'm not your priest,
O'Hara.

58:48.659 --> 58:51.061
Besides, we're cops,
not saints.

58:51.095 --> 58:53.163
- But you are a saint.

58:53.197 --> 58:55.299
And you taught me
to be one too.

58:55.332 --> 58:58.102
- Listen to me,
I took an oath

58:58.135 --> 59:00.938
to put the lives of strangers
before my own.

59:00.971 --> 59:03.273
Meanwhile, I have a daughter
who says a little prayer

59:03.307 --> 59:05.109
every morning
asking Jesus to please

59:05.142 --> 59:06.352
let her daddy make
it home for dinner.

59:06.376 --> 59:08.312
So, yes, I believe in a code.

59:08.345 --> 59:10.214
But I also believe in doing
whatever it takes

59:10.247 --> 59:12.282
to make sure bad people
don't hurt good people.

59:12.316 --> 59:14.985
Sometimes that means
getting creative.

59:15.019 --> 59:16.721
- I think I created a monster.

59:16.754 --> 59:18.756
- Well, if you created
the son of a bitch,

59:18.789 --> 59:22.059
then you can take him out.
I'll be there by morning.

59:22.092 --> 59:25.295
- Absolutely not.
I can clean up my own messes.

59:25.329 --> 59:27.097
- Man, I know what you can do.

59:27.131 --> 59:28.799
You be careful out there.

59:28.833 --> 59:31.235
And tell Spencer
to keep sucking it.

59:31.268 --> 59:33.971
Like, keep at it.
Do not stop.

59:34.004 --> 59:36.206
Will do.

59:36.240 --> 59:38.709
Please give my best
to your girls.

59:52.222 --> 59:59.229
*

01:00:03.100 --> 01:00:04.268
- Jules?

01:00:04.301 --> 01:00:11.308
*

01:00:16.681 --> 01:00:17.648
Gus!

01:00:17.682 --> 01:00:19.850
Wake up!

01:00:19.884 --> 01:00:21.786
Gus, wake up!
I think someone's here!

01:00:21.819 --> 01:00:23.721
Gus!

01:00:23.754 --> 01:00:25.322
Gus, wake up!

01:00:29.326 --> 01:00:30.861
Freeze!

01:00:30.895 --> 01:00:33.063
- Hey, Shawn.
- Mary?

01:00:33.097 --> 01:00:35.733
Wait... Mary?

01:00:35.766 --> 01:00:37.334
- Just a little amuse-bouche.

01:00:37.367 --> 01:00:39.279
I uncorked a Malbec
and I crafted a cheese board.

01:00:39.303 --> 01:00:40.671
Heavy on the manchego for you,

01:00:40.705 --> 01:00:43.073
sans anything blue for me.

01:00:43.107 --> 01:00:44.875
It crumbles.

01:00:44.909 --> 01:00:46.243
I don't care for that.

01:00:47.311 --> 01:00:48.412
Have a slab.

01:00:48.445 --> 01:00:51.148
- I...

01:00:53.283 --> 01:00:54.819
- Stay gold.

01:00:57.187 --> 01:00:59.256
I'm dreaming.

01:00:59.289 --> 01:01:01.091
God.

01:01:01.125 --> 01:01:02.326
You scared me, man.

01:01:02.359 --> 01:01:04.128
- You look handsome.

01:01:04.161 --> 01:01:06.797
Leathery.
- Oh, get out of here.

01:01:06.831 --> 01:01:08.165
You haven't aged a day.

01:01:08.198 --> 01:01:09.242
- Come on, live fast,
die young,

01:01:09.266 --> 01:01:10.467
leave a soft-faced corpse.

01:01:10.500 --> 01:01:13.170
Shawn.

01:01:13.203 --> 01:01:15.773
Do I look like
Richard Thomas to you?

01:01:15.806 --> 01:01:17.207
- John-Boy Richard Thomas?

01:01:17.241 --> 01:01:18.785
- There are those beyond
the Pearly Gates

01:01:18.809 --> 01:01:19.920
that think there's
a resemblance,

01:01:19.944 --> 01:01:23.781
and I don't see it, friend.

01:01:23.814 --> 01:01:26.250
How's your girl?
- She's good.

01:01:26.283 --> 01:01:28.185
She's, uh...
she's got a lot going on...

01:01:28.218 --> 01:01:29.286
- Mm.
- Right now.

01:01:29.319 --> 01:01:30.487
It's...
- Good.

01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:32.189
- It's complicated.
- Oh.

01:01:32.222 --> 01:01:34.491
Yeah.
- If I don't find that ring,

01:01:34.524 --> 01:01:35.726
I am gonna blow it with her

01:01:35.760 --> 01:01:37.227
all over again, man.

01:01:37.261 --> 01:01:38.262
- Oh, Shawn.

01:01:39.930 --> 01:01:41.131
I know what you need.

01:01:42.800 --> 01:01:44.769
- Oh, no.
Not... I don't...

01:01:44.802 --> 01:01:45.936
Mary, easy.

01:01:45.970 --> 01:01:47.104
Mary...

01:01:48.973 --> 01:01:52.209
- * I've lost my mind

01:01:52.242 --> 01:01:56.180
* On what I'd find

01:01:56.213 --> 01:01:58.749
* All of the pressures
that I left behind *

01:01:58.783 --> 01:02:01.385
* On Allison Road

01:02:03.854 --> 01:02:05.756
- Warm drawn butter.
- I know.

01:02:05.790 --> 01:02:08.492
* Fools in the rain

01:02:08.525 --> 01:02:11.929
* If the sun gets through

01:02:11.962 --> 01:02:14.832
* Fires in the Heaven
of the eyes I knew *

01:02:14.865 --> 01:02:17.868
* On Allison Road

01:02:17.902 --> 01:02:19.469
- You were right.

01:02:19.503 --> 01:02:21.305
The Gin Blossoms is exactly
what I needed.

01:02:21.338 --> 01:02:23.507
- * Dark clouds file,
the moon is near *

01:02:23.540 --> 01:02:26.243
* Birds fly by a.m.
in her bedroom stare *

01:02:26.276 --> 01:02:28.946
* There's no telling
what I might find *

01:02:28.979 --> 01:02:34.751
* I couldn't see I was
lost at the time *

01:02:35.886 --> 01:02:38.555
* Jingle jangle dingle
dangle jingle jangle ding *

01:02:38.588 --> 01:02:41.391
* Jingle jongle dingle dongle
Allison Road *

01:02:41.425 --> 01:02:44.161
* Jingle jangle dingle dangle
jingle jangle ding *

01:02:44.194 --> 01:02:47.164
* Jingle jongle dingle dongle
Allison Road *

01:02:47.197 --> 01:02:50.434
- * I can see I was
lost at the time... *

01:02:52.369 --> 01:02:55.505
Wait for it...

01:02:55.539 --> 01:02:57.274
- Could you please
keep it down?!

01:02:57.307 --> 01:02:59.176
I am trying to meditate.

01:02:59.209 --> 01:03:01.178
- What is that?
Why is he doing that?

01:03:01.211 --> 01:03:02.388
- Why is he here? Why is...
- What is that?

01:03:02.412 --> 01:03:03.380
This is my dream!

01:03:03.413 --> 01:03:04.548
- This isn't for you.

01:03:04.581 --> 01:03:07.952
- Is nothing sacred anymore?!

01:03:07.985 --> 01:03:09.453
- Fine.

01:03:09.486 --> 01:03:15.259
* On Allison Road

01:03:15.292 --> 01:03:18.228
- Whoo-hoooo...
- Shawn.

01:03:18.262 --> 01:03:19.563
Shawn!

01:03:19.596 --> 01:03:21.431
Shawn!

01:03:21.465 --> 01:03:23.433
- Would you stop singing
and wake up?

01:03:23.467 --> 01:03:24.835
It's morning.

01:03:28.305 --> 01:03:30.007
- I got to feed the pony.

01:03:34.044 --> 01:03:36.013
Ugh.

01:03:41.618 --> 01:03:43.620
Stop calling me, Mischa.
I'm out.

01:03:43.653 --> 01:03:46.023
Vandalizing cars? Petty theft?

01:03:46.056 --> 01:03:48.325
You're rich and bored,
and it's gross.

01:03:48.358 --> 01:03:50.961
And by the way, everyone knows
you stuff your bra.

01:03:53.063 --> 01:03:55.399
- Well, John Hughes,
eat your heart out.

01:03:55.432 --> 01:03:57.067
I mean, I wish I had
that kind of courage

01:03:57.101 --> 01:03:58.268
when I was your age.

01:03:58.302 --> 01:03:59.469
Bravo.

01:03:59.503 --> 01:04:00.546
- Thanks, but I'm
not really cool

01:04:00.570 --> 01:04:02.072
with talking to strangers.

01:04:02.106 --> 01:04:03.626
- Fair enough.
I'll do all the talking.

01:04:10.014 --> 01:04:11.974
- I'm surprised you got here
before Juliet, Chief,

01:04:13.283 --> 01:04:14.427
considering how much closer
she is to your daughter,

01:04:14.451 --> 01:04:16.286
- Don't worry, she'll be here.

01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:17.654
And she still has
seven minutes.

01:04:17.687 --> 01:04:19.123
- Do I look worried?

01:04:19.156 --> 01:04:22.292
I'm wearing ladies' makeup
right now.

01:04:22.326 --> 01:04:24.228
Ah, the belle of the ball.

01:04:24.261 --> 01:04:26.330
Just in time.

01:04:27.965 --> 01:04:29.666
- Thank you for coming
so quickly.

01:04:29.699 --> 01:04:31.135
I wasn't expecting
the cavalry.

01:04:31.168 --> 01:04:32.245
- They didn't give me
a choice.

01:04:32.269 --> 01:04:34.004
- What's this?

01:04:34.038 --> 01:04:36.206
Does no one think the rules
apply to them anymore?

01:04:36.240 --> 01:04:38.943
Now I've got to call this in
on this stupid walkie-talkie.

01:04:38.976 --> 01:04:40.110
- Call it in to who?

01:04:40.144 --> 01:04:42.246
- Whom. To whom.

01:04:42.279 --> 01:04:44.481
Can someone please
explain that to him?

01:04:44.514 --> 01:04:47.284
- Okay. Clearly we are
dealing with more

01:04:47.317 --> 01:04:49.053
than just the Thin White Duke,

01:04:49.086 --> 01:04:51.155
Heather Rockrear,
and the Black Gentleman Dandy.

01:04:51.188 --> 01:04:52.398
Which means Gus and I should
definitely be packing.

01:04:52.422 --> 01:04:53.991
- Not a chance.
- Come on!

01:04:54.024 --> 01:04:55.292
- That's easy for you to say.

01:04:55.325 --> 01:04:57.261
We're gonna be sitting ducks
out there.

01:04:57.294 --> 01:04:59.272
My perfect head is like catnip
to a long-range rifle scope.

01:04:59.296 --> 01:05:00.897
- Hi, Karen.

01:05:02.432 --> 01:05:04.935
- All right, looks like
all of you can come.

01:05:04.969 --> 01:05:07.171
Turns out this wasn't
altogether unexpected.

01:05:07.204 --> 01:05:09.439
But you're all going to die.

01:05:09.473 --> 01:05:12.276
And, moreover, nobody's
packing anything, all right?

01:05:12.309 --> 01:05:13.978
You got a gun,
it goes in the bag.

01:05:14.011 --> 01:05:15.112
And your butts on the boat.

01:05:15.145 --> 01:05:16.480
Come on, move it.

01:05:16.513 --> 01:05:18.258
You, too. I know you're
not packing anything.

01:05:18.282 --> 01:05:19.359
Certainly not in your trousers.

01:05:19.383 --> 01:05:21.185
Come on. You, in.

01:05:21.218 --> 01:05:22.552
Move it. Let's go.
On the boat.

01:05:22.586 --> 01:05:25.122
You too, sweetheart.
Come on.

01:05:25.155 --> 01:05:27.091
Juliet, no need to
pat you down, right?

01:05:27.124 --> 01:05:28.993
- So what's the plan?

01:05:29.026 --> 01:05:30.103
- Well, I didn't know we were
getting into a boat

01:05:30.127 --> 01:05:31.361
until ten seconds again.

01:05:31.395 --> 01:05:33.097
- I may make a jump for it.

01:05:33.130 --> 01:05:35.065
How many sharks do you
think are in the bay?

01:05:35.099 --> 01:05:36.733
- At least one.
- Dammit.

01:05:36.766 --> 01:05:38.411
- What are you
supposed to be now?

01:05:38.435 --> 01:05:39.536
Is this The Riddler?

01:05:39.569 --> 01:05:41.538
- He's funny.

01:05:41.571 --> 01:05:43.140
Do you keep him around
for the jokes?

01:05:43.173 --> 01:05:44.374
Get in the boat, Tobolowsky!

01:05:44.408 --> 01:05:46.210
- You just called me
Tobolowsky.

01:05:46.243 --> 01:05:48.278
That is a deep cut, and now
I am very rattled.

01:05:48.312 --> 01:05:50.247
- Shut up.
In you go.

01:05:54.318 --> 01:05:57.021
- Gus, what do you know
about Alcatraz?

01:05:57.054 --> 01:05:58.255
- Not much.

01:05:58.288 --> 01:06:01.091
Built in 1934,
336 mainline cells,

01:06:01.125 --> 01:06:02.326
definitely haunted.

01:06:02.359 --> 01:06:04.194
The legendary
"Birdman of Alcatraz"

01:06:04.228 --> 01:06:06.496
did all of his actual breeding
in Leavenworth, Kansas.

01:06:06.530 --> 01:06:08.298
- Didn't you just say
"not much"?

01:06:08.332 --> 01:06:09.542
- I haven't been since they
closed for restoration

01:06:09.566 --> 01:06:12.036
last year, Shawn.

01:06:14.604 --> 01:06:16.240
No. Shawn,

01:06:16.273 --> 01:06:18.342
there's no way he's
taking us to Alcatraz.

01:06:21.311 --> 01:06:22.551
- Well, I'm absolutely
mortified

01:06:22.579 --> 01:06:24.481
that no one's here
to greet us,

01:06:24.514 --> 01:06:26.426
but you just can't find
good help these days, can you?

01:06:26.450 --> 01:06:28.028
Please, please, make your way
all the way to the front.

01:06:28.052 --> 01:06:29.186
I'll be with you shortly.

01:06:29.219 --> 01:06:30.287
Don't dawdle.

01:06:32.056 --> 01:06:33.457
- Dude, I got to say,

01:06:33.490 --> 01:06:35.492
this restoration is
coming along great.

01:06:35.525 --> 01:06:37.127
If I'm looking
on the bright side...

01:06:37.161 --> 01:06:38.495
It's nice to get
a sneak preview.

01:06:38.528 --> 01:06:39.605
- You're talking about
the bright side

01:06:39.629 --> 01:06:41.031
of dying in Alcatraz.

01:06:41.065 --> 01:06:42.132
- Lights!

01:06:43.633 --> 01:06:45.635
Is everyone comfortable?

01:06:45.669 --> 01:06:48.138
- Enough. What have you done
with Iris, you son of a bitch?!

01:06:48.172 --> 01:06:50.207
- Oy, Chatty Cathy, shut it.

01:06:50.240 --> 01:06:52.509
I've got a slew of events
planned for tonight,

01:06:52.542 --> 01:06:54.411
and I don't want to be rushed.

01:06:54.444 --> 01:06:56.389
So! Now that I have delivered
tonight's guest of honor

01:06:56.413 --> 01:06:57.647
and, as luck would have it,

01:06:57.681 --> 01:06:59.383
all of her stupid-faced
friends,

01:06:59.416 --> 01:07:00.450
my job here is done.

01:07:00.484 --> 01:07:01.551
- Thank God.

01:07:03.420 --> 01:07:04.588
- I literally heard that.

01:07:04.621 --> 01:07:06.190
You said it just loud enough

01:07:06.223 --> 01:07:07.267
that I could hear
what you said.

01:07:07.291 --> 01:07:09.126
Where was I?

01:07:09.159 --> 01:07:10.536
Oh, yeah, would you like
to all meet

01:07:10.560 --> 01:07:12.296
tonight's actual headliner?

01:07:12.329 --> 01:07:14.164
- Headliner?
- Oh yeah, man.

01:07:14.198 --> 01:07:15.375
She's been paying
for all of it.

01:07:18.168 --> 01:07:20.537
Oh, my G...

01:07:22.872 --> 01:07:24.408
- Ugh.

01:07:24.441 --> 01:07:26.543
So what's the consensus
on the accent?

01:07:26.576 --> 01:07:28.378
Because it's definitely
not Bowie.

01:07:35.185 --> 01:07:37.487
*

01:07:37.521 --> 01:07:38.855
- Allison Cowley!

01:07:38.888 --> 01:07:40.490
My dream.
Allison Road.

01:07:40.524 --> 01:07:42.492
Gin Blossoms.
I had a... I had a dream!

01:07:42.526 --> 01:07:45.162
Mary was there.
We sang "Allison Road."

01:07:45.195 --> 01:07:47.431
You were Prince, and Jules
was Princess Leia,

01:07:47.464 --> 01:07:48.432
there was a pony,

01:07:48.465 --> 01:07:49.433
the pony said st...

01:07:51.201 --> 01:07:52.169
- Thank you, guys,

01:07:52.202 --> 01:07:53.437
for putting up with him.

01:07:53.470 --> 01:07:55.172
Really.
It was hard on us all.

01:07:55.205 --> 01:07:56.573
But his petty revenge scheme

01:07:56.606 --> 01:07:59.509
was just too fortuitous
to pass up!

01:07:59.543 --> 01:08:02.179
And I must admit,
I was secretly hoping

01:08:02.212 --> 01:08:03.513
you'd all show up,
family-style.

01:08:03.547 --> 01:08:06.483
It's like four free
bowls of soup.

01:08:06.516 --> 01:08:08.552
Questions, really?
Oh, okay.

01:08:08.585 --> 01:08:10.587
- I'm sorry, you just
shot your partner.

01:08:10.620 --> 01:08:12.456
- Uh, not a question, Shawn,

01:08:12.489 --> 01:08:14.224
but why split hairs?

01:08:14.258 --> 01:08:16.493
He was only useful until now.

01:08:16.526 --> 01:08:18.295
He wanted revenge,

01:08:18.328 --> 01:08:20.229
but he didn't have
the tool set that I do.

01:08:20.264 --> 01:08:21.365
We struck a deal.

01:08:21.398 --> 01:08:23.332
He ruins Juliet's legacy,

01:08:23.367 --> 01:08:26.136
and then I get to beat her
to death.

01:08:26.170 --> 01:08:27.571
It's a classic win-win;

01:08:27.604 --> 01:08:28.613
happens all the time
in the Batman movies.

01:08:28.638 --> 01:08:29.906
- Dude. Cheese cloth.

01:08:29.939 --> 01:08:31.441
- You're hungry now?

01:08:31.475 --> 01:08:32.718
I would never eat cheese
in cloth form.

01:08:32.742 --> 01:08:34.578
- Painter's cheese
cloth, Shawn.

01:08:34.611 --> 01:08:37.147
It's used in construction.
For the refurbishment.

01:08:37.180 --> 01:08:38.524
It's usually hanging
straight down,

01:08:38.548 --> 01:08:41.518
but it's pushed to the side
over there.

01:08:41.551 --> 01:08:43.487
- Zero attention span,
am I right?

01:08:43.520 --> 01:08:45.288
- What the hell do you want,
Cowley?

01:08:48.658 --> 01:08:49.626
Isn't it obvious?

01:08:49.658 --> 01:08:51.728
I want a do-over.

01:08:51.761 --> 01:08:53.162
You ruined me.

01:08:53.197 --> 01:08:54.531
The night you arrested me

01:08:54.564 --> 01:08:56.332
was supposed to be
my coming-out party.

01:08:56.366 --> 01:08:59.269
Yin to me.
A passing of the torch.

01:08:59.303 --> 01:09:01.305
A changing of...
Am I doing too many similes?

01:09:01.337 --> 01:09:02.515
I feel like I went
one too far.

01:09:02.538 --> 01:09:04.474
- Comedy often plays
in threes.

01:09:04.508 --> 01:09:06.410
- I'm not doing a bit.

01:09:06.443 --> 01:09:08.220
- I think Iris is
somewhere through that doorway

01:09:08.245 --> 01:09:09.712
on the left.

01:09:09.746 --> 01:09:11.524
Also, cheese cloth
and the word "refurbishment"

01:09:11.548 --> 01:09:13.383
are actual things.

01:09:13.417 --> 01:09:15.185
- Chief.

01:09:15.219 --> 01:09:17.654
Your kid's somewhere
in the building.

01:09:17.687 --> 01:09:19.189
There are explosives involved,

01:09:19.223 --> 01:09:20.524
so you're facing
an uphill battle

01:09:20.557 --> 01:09:21.667
even if you do manage
to find her.

01:09:21.691 --> 01:09:23.560
But, as a woman,

01:09:23.593 --> 01:09:25.295
I refuse to believe that
you're not capable

01:09:25.328 --> 01:09:26.563
of overcoming the odds.

01:09:26.595 --> 01:09:28.665
It's just that you're not.

01:09:30.267 --> 01:09:31.600
But look at the bright side.

01:09:31.635 --> 01:09:33.737
The two of you get
to blow up together.

01:09:33.770 --> 01:09:36.340
- What'd she say?
- I can't hear a word.

01:09:36.372 --> 01:09:37.774
- Gentlemen,

01:09:37.807 --> 01:09:39.709
now that the four of you
have crashed my party,

01:09:39.743 --> 01:09:41.745
you have the very
unenviable task

01:09:41.778 --> 01:09:43.580
of getting past my colleagues.

01:09:43.613 --> 01:09:45.349
They've been instructed
to toy with you

01:09:45.381 --> 01:09:47.517
and give you
a false sense of confidence

01:09:47.551 --> 01:09:50.687
and then kill you in whichever
order or way feels most fun.

01:09:50.720 --> 01:09:52.356
- Uh...

01:09:52.389 --> 01:09:54.691
put me down for
auto-erotic asphyxiation.

01:09:54.724 --> 01:09:57.261
- Who is this guy?

01:09:57.294 --> 01:09:59.263
- I'm the assistant
coroner, bitch.

01:09:59.296 --> 01:10:00.706
- Aw, come on.
- Okay, all right.

01:10:00.730 --> 01:10:02.532
I have to apologize
to everybody

01:10:02.566 --> 01:10:04.568
for that whole,
uh, "bitch" thing.

01:10:04.601 --> 01:10:06.479
That was uncalled for.
- Strode, Strode, shut up.

01:10:06.503 --> 01:10:08.838
She's about to kill us.
- That's no excuse, Henry.

01:10:08.872 --> 01:10:11.375
It's a new world.
I know it. We all know it.

01:10:11.408 --> 01:10:12.809
And... and there is no reason

01:10:12.842 --> 01:10:15.579
that your gender should
have any bearing

01:10:15.612 --> 01:10:17.447
on my choice of insults.

01:10:17.481 --> 01:10:19.316
- Are you serious?

01:10:19.349 --> 01:10:20.684
- Duly noted.

01:10:20.717 --> 01:10:22.319
Can you shut up forever?

01:10:22.352 --> 01:10:24.654
- Oh. Yes.

01:10:24.688 --> 01:10:27.357
- Which brings me
to Little Miss

01:10:27.391 --> 01:10:29.726
Little-Miss-Can't-Be-Wrong.

01:10:29.759 --> 01:10:31.861
We have unfinished business.

01:10:31.895 --> 01:10:34.664
I didn't say go.
Did anyone hear "go"?

01:10:34.698 --> 01:10:36.533
All right, what the hell.

01:10:36.566 --> 01:10:38.802
Timer's set to 20.
Let's do it right this time.

01:10:38.835 --> 01:10:40.437
Kill the lights.

01:10:41.638 --> 01:10:43.673
Wh-who's Iris?

01:10:43.707 --> 01:10:46.443
- Jules!
- Iris! Iris?

01:10:46.476 --> 01:10:48.845
- Jules, wait!
Maybe we should stick together.

01:10:48.878 --> 01:10:51.748
- Iris!

01:10:51.781 --> 01:10:53.483
- Gus, what are you doing?

01:10:53.517 --> 01:10:54.684
What, are you leaving?

01:10:54.718 --> 01:10:55.795
- I'm getting us
to the lighthouse

01:10:55.819 --> 01:10:59.055
to signal for help, Shawn.

01:10:59.088 --> 01:11:00.424
- Technically that's leaving.

01:11:00.457 --> 01:11:01.791
- I'm not commenting on plans

01:11:01.825 --> 01:11:03.493
once I get to the lighthouse,
Shawn.

01:11:03.527 --> 01:11:04.670
But someone's gotta
wait outside.

01:11:10.567 --> 01:11:12.636
- Good evening, gentlemen.

01:11:12.669 --> 01:11:14.571
I will be dismantling
the both of you

01:11:14.604 --> 01:11:16.373
in a matter of moments.

01:11:17.941 --> 01:11:19.509
- Shawn Spencer.
- Verb.

01:11:19.543 --> 01:11:21.811
- Pleasure.
- Everything good?

01:11:25.749 --> 01:11:26.850
- Gus...

01:11:26.883 --> 01:11:30.387
he's no dandy.

01:11:30.420 --> 01:11:33.390
- He's a black gentleman ninja.

01:11:35.959 --> 01:11:38.862
- Still no ring
on the finger, I see.

01:11:38.895 --> 01:11:41.331
- Why does everyone
keep saying that?

01:11:57.714 --> 01:11:58.891
- I'm not crazy
about overpowering

01:11:58.915 --> 01:12:00.684
a woman in a singlet.

01:12:00.717 --> 01:12:02.819
- She's not wearing a singlet.
- No, I am.

01:12:02.852 --> 01:12:03.820
Under my clothes.

01:12:03.853 --> 01:12:05.555
Oh!

01:12:06.656 --> 01:12:08.725
- You know, I've been dealing
with broads like you

01:12:08.758 --> 01:12:10.460
my entire I... aaagh!

01:12:12.929 --> 01:12:14.564
- Apparently my milkshake

01:12:14.598 --> 01:12:17.701
brings old bald guys
to the yard.

01:12:17.734 --> 01:12:20.537
- I have a ribbon.

01:12:20.570 --> 01:12:22.372
- No, no. No, no. No!

01:12:22.406 --> 01:12:23.640
No! No! No, no, no!

01:12:25.675 --> 01:12:29.479
- * Deck the halls
with boughs of holly *

01:12:29.513 --> 01:12:32.849
- No! Not the arm!
Not the arm!

01:12:32.882 --> 01:12:35.652
- * Fa la la la la,
la la la la *

01:12:35.685 --> 01:12:39.823
* 'Tis the season
to be jolly *

01:12:39.856 --> 01:12:42.459
- No, no, no, no, no, no!

01:12:42.492 --> 01:12:43.993
- * Fa la la la la,
la la la la *

01:12:44.027 --> 01:12:46.563
- Please!

01:12:46.596 --> 01:12:49.966
- * Don we now our
gay apparel *

01:12:49.999 --> 01:12:51.735
- Time out, time out,
time out, time out!

01:12:51.768 --> 01:12:54.170
- * Fa la la, la la la...

01:12:54.203 --> 01:12:56.640
- Iris!

01:12:56.673 --> 01:12:59.543
Iris?

01:12:59.576 --> 01:13:02.512
- Gus, I'm not even
scared anymore.

01:13:02.546 --> 01:13:03.880
This is simply bedazzling.

01:13:03.913 --> 01:13:05.515
- I'm transfixed.

01:13:05.549 --> 01:13:07.183
How long is this
display going on for?

01:13:07.216 --> 01:13:09.586
- Hopefully long enough for him
to wear himself out.

01:13:11.588 --> 01:13:14.691
Okay, that's next level.
- The man gravity forgot.

01:13:14.724 --> 01:13:16.660
Oooh!

01:13:17.661 --> 01:13:19.663
Iris!

01:13:21.998 --> 01:13:23.533
- Hi.

01:13:26.903 --> 01:13:30.039
- It's okay. It's okay.

01:13:30.073 --> 01:13:31.941
Just sit tight, okay?

01:13:34.578 --> 01:13:35.845
Sit tight, baby.

01:13:35.879 --> 01:13:37.981
Okay, I'm gonna get
you out of here.

01:13:42.952 --> 01:13:44.754
- I shouldn't have
rejected Selene, Shawn.

01:13:44.788 --> 01:13:46.823
She's almost everything
I ever wanted in a woman,

01:13:46.856 --> 01:13:48.525
short of being
Gugu Mbatha-Raw.

01:13:48.558 --> 01:13:50.059
I'm so stubborn about
the Pluto thing.

01:13:50.093 --> 01:13:51.904
And you know I've got to be
the cheetah, Shawn.

01:13:51.928 --> 01:13:54.230
The cheetah!
- Gus, you are a cheetah.

01:13:54.263 --> 01:13:55.808
And she's basically
the female version of you.

01:13:55.832 --> 01:13:57.433
You know that.
- I know.

01:13:58.702 --> 01:14:00.470
I should've married Jules
three years ago.

01:14:00.504 --> 01:14:01.981
This ring is just
another excuse for me

01:14:02.005 --> 01:14:03.540
to avoid responsibility.

01:14:03.573 --> 01:14:04.774
- Mm-hmm.

01:14:04.808 --> 01:14:05.775
- She deserves better
than me, Gus.

01:14:05.809 --> 01:14:07.544
- No. No, Shawn.

01:14:07.577 --> 01:14:09.579
She deserves the best
version of you. Hey.

01:14:10.914 --> 01:14:12.448
I'm proud of you.

01:14:15.785 --> 01:14:17.062
- Let's do the thing
that we're best at.

01:14:17.086 --> 01:14:18.254
- You know that's right.

01:14:23.727 --> 01:14:27.664
- * I've lost my mind

01:14:27.697 --> 01:14:29.666
* On what I'd find

01:14:29.699 --> 01:14:31.635
*

01:14:31.668 --> 01:14:34.638
* All of the pressure
that I left behind *

01:14:34.671 --> 01:14:36.706
* On Allison Road

01:14:36.740 --> 01:14:38.642
*

01:14:38.675 --> 01:14:40.610
* Fools in the rain

01:14:40.644 --> 01:14:41.878
*

01:14:41.911 --> 01:14:43.713
* If the sun gets through

01:14:43.747 --> 01:14:45.849
*

01:14:45.882 --> 01:14:48.818
* Fire's in the heaven
of the eyes I knew *

01:14:48.852 --> 01:14:50.987
* On Allison Road

01:14:52.822 --> 01:14:54.958
- We can't go out
like this, Ryan.

01:14:54.991 --> 01:14:56.726
- My name is Henry.

01:14:56.760 --> 01:14:58.728
You've known me for
nine years, Strode.

01:14:58.762 --> 01:15:02.098
- Sorry. I can't stop thinking
about Ryan Reynolds.

01:15:02.131 --> 01:15:04.734
What can we do?
- I don't know.

01:15:04.768 --> 01:15:06.836
She's so much fitter than us.

01:15:06.870 --> 01:15:08.572
- Look at my thighs.

01:15:08.605 --> 01:15:10.674
*

01:15:10.707 --> 01:15:13.142
It's the last thing
I want you to see.

01:15:13.176 --> 01:15:15.011
- * On Allison Road, yeah

01:15:15.044 --> 01:15:18.582
* I didn't know
I was lost at the time *

01:15:18.615 --> 01:15:19.749
* On Allison Road
- Yeah!

01:15:19.783 --> 01:15:21.585
- That's it! Go, go!

01:15:21.618 --> 01:15:23.887
- * So she fills up
her sails *

01:15:23.920 --> 01:15:25.321
*

01:15:25.354 --> 01:15:26.690
* With my wasted breath

01:15:26.723 --> 01:15:27.724
- Whoo!

01:15:27.757 --> 01:15:29.659
*

01:15:29.693 --> 01:15:31.595
- * And each one's more
wasted than the others *

01:15:31.628 --> 01:15:33.597
* You can bet,
on Allison Road *

01:15:33.630 --> 01:15:36.165
- We need a key to the cell!
Let's go!

01:15:36.199 --> 01:15:39.669
- Oh, my God, I never...
I can't feel my arm.

01:15:39.703 --> 01:15:42.005
I can't feel my leg.
How am I walking?

01:15:42.038 --> 01:15:43.907
I can't feel my limbs!
How am I walking?

01:15:43.940 --> 01:15:46.042
- I'll get another one.
- I killed her!

01:15:46.075 --> 01:15:48.945
*

01:15:48.978 --> 01:15:50.914
- Isn't it funny, Juliet?

01:15:50.947 --> 01:15:52.348
I mean, we're both blondes.

01:15:52.381 --> 01:15:53.917
We're both smart.

01:15:53.950 --> 01:15:56.786
Business up front,
party in the back.

01:15:56.820 --> 01:15:58.955
I could've been you,
and you could've been me.

01:15:58.988 --> 01:16:01.591
There's really only one thing
that separates us...

01:16:02.826 --> 01:16:05.094
- You mean besides the capacity
to feel empathy?

01:16:05.128 --> 01:16:06.963
- No. Just that.

01:16:06.996 --> 01:16:08.632
Why, can you think
of something else?

01:16:08.665 --> 01:16:10.934
- I can.

01:16:10.967 --> 01:16:14.738
So, Shawn's office...

01:16:14.771 --> 01:16:16.181
is at the end of an alley
in Chinatown.

01:16:16.205 --> 01:16:17.707
It's called psychphrancisco,

01:16:17.741 --> 01:16:19.643
all one word, all lowercase.

01:16:19.676 --> 01:16:21.945
"Ph" for the f.
Not the wisest marketing move.

01:16:21.978 --> 01:16:23.780
But we are a we.

01:16:23.813 --> 01:16:25.815
We are an us.
We are lovers in the night.

01:16:25.849 --> 01:16:27.092
So we support each other
even when

01:16:27.116 --> 01:16:29.018
we make questionable decisions.

01:16:29.052 --> 01:16:30.863
- This is the weirdest
stalling for time speech

01:16:30.887 --> 01:16:32.622
I've ever heard.

01:16:32.656 --> 01:16:34.033
- It basically means
I spend my weekends

01:16:34.057 --> 01:16:36.159
in Chinatown waiting
on rickshaws

01:16:36.192 --> 01:16:38.828
and jade birdcages
to be delivered.

01:16:38.862 --> 01:16:40.697
Shawn loves "Gremlins."
I mean, who doesn't?

01:16:40.730 --> 01:16:42.165
It's my favorite
Christmas movie.

01:16:42.198 --> 01:16:44.100
- Technically, it's not
a Christmas movie,

01:16:44.133 --> 01:16:45.811
and I feel like you're just
getting further off-topic.

01:16:45.835 --> 01:16:47.704
- Point is,

01:16:47.737 --> 01:16:50.106
there's this incredible
martial arts gym next door.

01:16:50.139 --> 01:16:52.008
And I never knew

01:16:52.041 --> 01:16:53.977
what a "kip up" was

01:16:54.010 --> 01:16:55.845
until I took the class.

01:16:57.446 --> 01:16:58.682
- Ugh!

01:17:01.284 --> 01:17:08.124
*

01:17:15.999 --> 01:17:17.133
- We need a key.

01:17:32.015 --> 01:17:34.150
Dad?

01:17:34.183 --> 01:17:35.852
- Hello, gentlemen.

01:17:35.885 --> 01:17:37.086
How fortuitous.

01:17:37.120 --> 01:17:40.289
Three birds, one wire.

01:17:40.323 --> 01:17:41.925
Gus, there's a table.

01:17:41.958 --> 01:17:43.860
- What?
- Gus, there's a table.

01:17:43.893 --> 01:17:45.893
- That has never worked, Shawn.
- It did work once.

01:17:47.931 --> 01:17:49.933
- Hi, baby, hi.

01:17:51.801 --> 01:17:53.245
- Chief, stop!
She said there'd be explosives.

01:17:55.238 --> 01:17:57.040
- Okay, okay.

01:17:57.073 --> 01:17:58.483
Okay, I need you to go back
as far as you can,

01:17:58.507 --> 01:17:59.976
'cause we are gonna
get this.

01:18:00.009 --> 01:18:03.747
Okay?

01:18:03.780 --> 01:18:05.715
- Let him go,
Gentleman Ninja.

01:18:05.749 --> 01:18:07.784
- I'm afraid this is the end.

01:18:07.817 --> 01:18:10.754
- Well, I'm afraid my dad's
not gonna die tonight.

01:18:10.787 --> 01:18:13.189
At least not by
your deftly manicured hands.

01:18:13.222 --> 01:18:17.060
I suppose natural causes
is still on the table.

01:18:19.763 --> 01:18:21.197
- What?
- The table.

01:18:21.230 --> 01:18:22.331
- No.
- Yes.

01:18:22.365 --> 01:18:25.134
- When?
- Now!

01:18:25.168 --> 01:18:28.137
Ha, damn it!

01:18:28.171 --> 01:18:30.273
He's so nimble!

01:18:30.306 --> 01:18:32.308
*

01:18:32.341 --> 01:18:34.744
- Uhhh!

01:18:34.778 --> 01:18:35.779
- Freeze!

01:18:35.812 --> 01:18:37.713
You arrogant bastard.

01:18:40.083 --> 01:18:42.752
- Woody, Woody.
- Oh, thank God.

01:18:44.553 --> 01:18:46.022
- Cheers.
Cheers.

01:18:50.226 --> 01:18:52.228
- Okay, just... just get out
of here, Juliet, okay?

01:18:52.261 --> 01:18:54.097
Just... please, just go.

01:18:54.130 --> 01:18:55.841
Okay, baby, I need you
to go back as far as you can

01:18:55.865 --> 01:18:56.976
because Mommy's
not going anywhere.

01:18:59.202 --> 01:19:00.870
Don't pull the wire!

01:19:00.904 --> 01:19:02.347
It's a code, it's a date!
I heard them.

01:19:02.371 --> 01:19:04.908
It's the day Mr. Yin died
and she got arrested!

01:19:14.884 --> 01:19:17.320
Why do you know that?

01:19:17.353 --> 01:19:20.056
- It was kind of
a big night for me.

01:19:21.224 --> 01:19:23.226
- Mom?
- Hey.

01:19:25.294 --> 01:19:26.362
Hi, baby.

01:19:31.901 --> 01:19:33.102
There you are.

01:19:33.136 --> 01:19:35.104
Let's get this off, huh?

01:19:38.274 --> 01:19:39.408
- Ah.

01:19:55.091 --> 01:19:56.411
- Shawn, I think
I'm gonna bounce.

01:19:57.593 --> 01:19:59.595
I got a unicycling class
that starts...

01:19:59.628 --> 01:20:01.030
eh, screw it.

01:20:01.064 --> 01:20:02.498
Nah, I'm going fishing.

01:20:02.531 --> 01:20:03.933
- Am I the only one
who's hungry?

01:20:03.967 --> 01:20:06.269
- I could eat.
- Gus?

01:20:06.302 --> 01:20:09.005
- Dude, you have to block
this girl from your Instagram.

01:20:09.038 --> 01:20:10.039
- What...

01:20:10.073 --> 01:20:11.207
are you doing here?

01:20:11.240 --> 01:20:12.909
- Wow, thank you.

01:20:12.942 --> 01:20:15.578
Uh, Selene,
before we go any further,

01:20:15.611 --> 01:20:17.180
let me just say this.

01:20:17.213 --> 01:20:18.848
That was the best
fluffernutter sandwich

01:20:18.882 --> 01:20:20.917
I've ever eaten
in my entire life.

01:20:20.950 --> 01:20:22.527
And I'm completely willing
to make a go at this.

01:20:22.551 --> 01:20:24.587
But you must let me
be the cheetah

01:20:24.620 --> 01:20:25.922
in this relationship.

01:20:25.955 --> 01:20:28.491
- Done.
- Cool.

01:20:32.128 --> 01:20:34.197
That is not letting
me be the cheetah.

01:20:37.133 --> 01:20:38.267
Mmm.

01:20:41.537 --> 01:20:44.273
- Shawn Spencer. Psychic.

01:20:46.642 --> 01:20:49.612
- Wow. Word's really, uh,
gotten out on this thing.

01:20:49.645 --> 01:20:51.547
- You promised me that
you had these skills.

01:20:51.580 --> 01:20:54.217
I'm here to tell you,
all those things you claimed,

01:20:54.250 --> 01:20:56.152
those premonitions
you told me...

01:20:59.555 --> 01:21:00.523
They came true!

01:21:02.058 --> 01:21:03.235
- How do you do it?
No, really?

01:21:03.259 --> 01:21:05.061
- Well...
- It's unbelievable, man.

01:21:05.094 --> 01:21:06.963
- What? You're serious?

01:21:06.996 --> 01:21:07.964
Those things actually happened?

01:21:07.997 --> 01:21:08.998
- Every one.

01:21:09.032 --> 01:21:10.066
- How?
- Gus...

01:21:10.099 --> 01:21:11.267
- How?!
- Gus.

01:21:11.300 --> 01:21:12.601
- What?
- You know how.

01:21:17.273 --> 01:21:19.542
- It's just a new program we
have down at the Bureau.

01:21:19.575 --> 01:21:22.011
That's the Internal
Revenue Service.

01:21:22.045 --> 01:21:23.646
It's called "Clean Start."

01:21:23.679 --> 01:21:25.314
You're all clear
on your taxes.

01:21:25.348 --> 01:21:27.683
Happy holidays.

01:21:29.218 --> 01:21:31.887
- Whoa! That was close, sir.

01:21:33.156 --> 01:21:34.890
You must have
a guardian angel.

01:21:36.359 --> 01:21:39.062
- Can I borrow your salt?
Ugh!

01:21:39.095 --> 01:21:41.130
Sharp pains!

01:21:41.164 --> 01:21:44.000
Let this be a cautionary tale
to all.

01:21:47.670 --> 01:21:49.172
- You have a gift,
my friend.

01:21:49.205 --> 01:21:50.715
- That's a sweet thing
to say from you, yeah.

01:21:50.739 --> 01:21:53.576
- In return, I have
a gift for you.

01:21:53.609 --> 01:21:55.620
- Oh, that's t... it's too much.
- He's gonna shoot us.

01:21:55.644 --> 01:21:56.612
We should've never
the bait, dammit!

01:21:56.645 --> 01:21:57.713
- It's o...

01:22:01.317 --> 01:22:02.718
- You were right.

01:22:02.751 --> 01:22:04.587
Very difficult to find.

01:22:04.620 --> 01:22:07.190
But your three years were
not wasted looking.

01:22:07.223 --> 01:22:08.700
You just weren't willing
to break any limbs

01:22:08.724 --> 01:22:09.959
to get your information.

01:22:12.228 --> 01:22:15.064
You are so lucky.

01:22:15.098 --> 01:22:17.366
- No way.

01:22:21.137 --> 01:22:22.638
Is that...

01:22:22.671 --> 01:22:24.607
- Yeah.

01:22:24.640 --> 01:22:26.075
Oh, my God.

01:22:28.444 --> 01:22:30.613
That's totally it.

01:22:30.646 --> 01:22:33.216
Thank you.

01:22:33.249 --> 01:22:35.218
I'm ready.

01:22:35.251 --> 01:22:36.385
- You are?
- Oh, hell yes.

01:22:36.419 --> 01:22:38.087
You have been so patient.

01:22:38.121 --> 01:22:39.322
And I love you so much.

01:22:39.355 --> 01:22:41.124
And I'm so grateful for you.

01:22:41.157 --> 01:22:44.060
So let's go to the airport

01:22:44.093 --> 01:22:47.396
and fly to Iceland
and rent a volcano.

01:22:47.430 --> 01:22:49.765
Or... or we can venture
to your family's homeland

01:22:49.798 --> 01:22:51.667
in Inverness and...
And vow it up

01:22:51.700 --> 01:22:53.469
surrounded by Highland cows.

01:22:53.502 --> 01:22:55.171
- Curious beasts.
- Or!

01:22:55.204 --> 01:22:57.106
Or we can married on
Mr. Toad's Wild Ride.

01:22:57.140 --> 01:22:59.142
We'd have to talk fast,
'cause I think the ride's

01:22:59.175 --> 01:23:01.220
only a minute and a half long,
and the car only seats four

01:23:01.244 --> 01:23:02.354
and we'll need room
for Gus and...

01:23:02.378 --> 01:23:03.779
- Shawn.

01:23:03.812 --> 01:23:05.781
I don't need any of that.

01:23:05.814 --> 01:23:07.650
I never have.

01:23:09.252 --> 01:23:10.729
- You're gonna want
one of those cows.

01:23:10.753 --> 01:23:13.456
Don't make the same
mistake I did.

01:23:13.489 --> 01:23:16.059
- Let's just call a Lyft

01:23:16.092 --> 01:23:17.760
and go to Vegas right now.

01:23:17.793 --> 01:23:19.095
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:23:19.128 --> 01:23:21.764
- Okay.

01:23:21.797 --> 01:23:23.366
Yes, Mr. Provedor?

01:23:23.399 --> 01:23:25.101
- I'm ordained.

01:23:25.134 --> 01:23:27.170
- What?
- I'll be your maid of honor.

01:23:27.203 --> 01:23:28.371
- Ooh!
- No, no, no, no, no.

01:23:28.404 --> 01:23:30.106
I don't think so.
Please.

01:23:30.139 --> 01:23:31.440
- Mom...
- Overreaching.

01:23:31.474 --> 01:23:33.242
You know what?
Completely my fault.

01:23:33.276 --> 01:23:35.411
- Move it, Vick.
We're ready to begin.

01:23:35.444 --> 01:23:37.012
- Woody!

01:23:40.816 --> 01:23:42.151
- Gus...

01:23:43.419 --> 01:23:44.429
- I knew this was
gonna happen, Shawn.

01:23:44.453 --> 01:23:46.322
- I know, I know, I know.

01:23:46.355 --> 01:23:47.766
But you gotta pull it together,
'cause I need your

01:23:47.790 --> 01:23:50.793
best man speech to kill.
- It will.

01:23:50.826 --> 01:23:52.528
- Hey.

01:23:52.561 --> 01:23:54.439
My sincerest congratulations
to the both of you.

01:23:54.463 --> 01:23:55.764
- Oh, thanks, man.

01:23:55.798 --> 01:23:56.799
- You're welcome.

01:23:56.832 --> 01:23:58.134
- Very kind.

01:23:58.167 --> 01:23:59.368
That's just a good dude.

01:23:59.402 --> 01:24:01.104
- Brother's gotta
make a living.

01:24:01.137 --> 01:24:02.505
- This economy? Absolutely.
- Yeah.

01:24:02.538 --> 01:24:05.108
- Shall we begin?
- Oh! I do.

01:24:05.141 --> 01:24:06.242
- Me too.

01:24:12.315 --> 01:24:14.150
*

01:24:15.884 --> 01:24:17.286
You skipped a few things.

01:24:17.320 --> 01:24:19.155
It's okay.
- Right, sure.

01:24:19.188 --> 01:24:20.156
- Let's start from
the beginning.

01:24:22.558 --> 01:24:24.260
Dearly beloved,

01:24:24.293 --> 01:24:26.162
we are gathered here
to celebrate the union

01:24:26.195 --> 01:24:27.496
of two lovely people

01:24:27.530 --> 01:24:29.298
and, uh, bear witness

01:24:29.332 --> 01:24:33.169
to their union
and holy matrimony.

01:24:33.202 --> 01:24:36.139
Should anyone here know of
any reason this couple

01:24:36.172 --> 01:24:39.175
should not be wed, please speak
now or forever hold your peace.

01:24:39.208 --> 01:24:41.477
- Yeah, I have a few things I'd
like to get off my chest.

01:24:41.510 --> 01:24:44.180
- Woody, really?
- Oh, not about this.

01:24:44.213 --> 01:24:45.490
Can I wait until later?
- Yeah, I think so.

01:24:45.514 --> 01:24:47.450
- You know what?
I'm gonna wait.

01:24:56.459 --> 01:24:58.161
*

01:24:58.194 --> 01:25:00.863
- Gus! We're gonna need
a bigger boat!

01:25:02.831 --> 01:25:04.467
- Stop playing around, Shawn.

01:25:04.500 --> 01:25:06.245
The girl's already
at the airport checked in.

01:25:06.269 --> 01:25:07.470
Find your damn passport.

01:25:07.503 --> 01:25:10.173
- Boom! Found it.

01:25:10.206 --> 01:25:13.209
Oh, hey, should I slice
this up for the road?

01:25:13.242 --> 01:25:14.610
- Let's go, Shawn.

01:25:14.643 --> 01:25:16.579
Look, I'ma ask you this
one more time.

01:25:16.612 --> 01:25:19.482
Are you absolutely sure Juliet
is okay with Selene and I

01:25:19.515 --> 01:25:20.883
tagging along on
your honeymoon?

01:25:20.916 --> 01:25:22.261
- She's come to expect
nothing less.

01:25:22.285 --> 01:25:24.153
- All right.

01:25:24.653 --> 01:25:25.821
Should we be worried?

01:25:25.854 --> 01:25:27.490
- Nah, it's Chinatown.

01:25:27.523 --> 01:25:29.358
It's probably firecrackers
or jiffy pop.

01:25:29.392 --> 01:25:30.793
Bubble wrap, bubble tea.

01:25:30.826 --> 01:25:32.306
Could be any one
of those things, Gus.

01:25:35.564 --> 01:25:37.633
- Congratulations, bro!

01:25:37.666 --> 01:25:39.835
Finally made an honest woman
out of my sis.

01:25:39.868 --> 01:25:41.837
- Ewan? What the hell
are you doing here?

01:25:41.870 --> 01:25:43.372
- Oh, man.

01:25:43.406 --> 01:25:44.573
I'm chillin'.

01:25:47.610 --> 01:25:49.545
*

01:25:50.546 --> 01:25:51.956
Hey, you guys got
a back door in here?

01:25:51.980 --> 01:25:55.251
Gus!

01:25:55.284 --> 01:25:57.253
- So I was just gonna
mail you a wedding present,

01:25:57.286 --> 01:25:59.488
but that's, like, a dick move,
so here you go.

01:25:59.522 --> 01:26:01.490
And tied a little business in
at the same time.

01:26:01.524 --> 01:26:03.592
do you guys
have a Kevlar vest

01:26:03.626 --> 01:26:06.462
or possibly a lead shield
I could borrow?

01:26:06.495 --> 01:26:07.639
- Actually, we're on our way
to the airport

01:26:07.663 --> 01:26:09.265
for my honeymoon.

01:26:09.298 --> 01:26:11.434
- Jamaica.
- Jamaica!

01:26:11.467 --> 01:26:13.236
Jamaica!

01:26:13.269 --> 01:26:14.870
- That's, like,
so played out, right?

01:26:14.903 --> 01:26:16.448
They got johnnycakes
at the Giants game now.

01:26:16.472 --> 01:26:17.940
- That's not funny, Ewan.

01:26:17.973 --> 01:26:20.943
- Sweet pad.
"Gremlins," right? Yes.

01:26:20.976 --> 01:26:23.646
Ah.
What happened to the Mogwai?

01:26:23.679 --> 01:26:26.282
- We... we ran into
some licensing issues.

01:26:28.016 --> 01:26:29.594
- Ewan O'Hara.
Come out with your hands up.

01:26:29.618 --> 01:26:30.995
Guys, this is all about me.

01:26:31.019 --> 01:26:32.955
You have nothing
to worry about.

01:26:32.988 --> 01:26:35.658
- Shawn Spencer and associate,
come out as well.

01:26:35.691 --> 01:26:37.293
- Okay, now it's about
you guys too.

01:26:37.326 --> 01:26:38.594
Could be a problem.
- Associate?

01:26:38.627 --> 01:26:40.329
I pay the damn rent
in this place!

01:26:40.363 --> 01:26:41.406
- Maybe if you were
around more often,

01:26:41.430 --> 01:26:42.931
they'd know who you were.

01:26:42.965 --> 01:26:44.467
- We're giving you
ten seconds.

01:26:44.500 --> 01:26:46.269
- Okay, uh,
quick change of plans.

01:26:46.302 --> 01:26:47.612
We gotta call an audible.
Jamaica's out.

01:26:47.636 --> 01:26:49.305
Uh, we'll split the heat
with my sister.

01:26:49.338 --> 01:26:50.906
How do you guys feel
about Oslo?

01:26:50.939 --> 01:26:52.641
- He definitely shot Kennedy.
- The city.

01:26:52.675 --> 01:26:53.642
- They named a city after that
son of a bitch?

01:26:53.676 --> 01:26:55.578
- Shawn...
- Gents.

01:26:55.611 --> 01:26:57.256
Good time to chat, but the back
door, the back door!

01:26:57.280 --> 01:26:58.947
- Uh, it's really
more of a staircase

01:26:58.981 --> 01:27:00.983
that leads to a tunnel
that lets out in Nob Hill.

01:27:01.016 --> 01:27:03.986
- Dude, Nob Hill?

01:27:04.019 --> 01:27:05.321
- Three...
- Where's the present?

01:27:05.354 --> 01:27:06.622
- I left it over there.

01:27:06.655 --> 01:27:08.023
- You're gonna need
the present.

01:27:08.056 --> 01:27:10.359
Bogies! 12:00.
- One.

01:27:10.393 --> 01:27:12.328
- Whoa!
- We have contact!

01:27:15.331 --> 01:27:16.532
- Through the window!

01:27:22.338 --> 01:27:24.673
Better be an awesome gift!

01:27:24.707 --> 01:27:26.609
- Don't ever break the casing
or drop it!

01:27:29.077 --> 01:27:30.589
- That's not really
a wedding gift, is it?

01:27:30.613 --> 01:27:32.648
- It's the thought
that counts, Gus!

01:27:36.985 --> 01:27:38.354
*

01:27:38.387 --> 01:27:40.356
- * I know, you know

01:27:40.389 --> 01:27:41.700
* That I'm not
telling the truth *

01:27:41.724 --> 01:27:43.492
* I know, you know

01:27:43.526 --> 01:27:45.294
* They just don't
have any proof *

01:27:45.328 --> 01:27:46.562
* Embrace the deception

01:27:46.595 --> 01:27:48.331
* Learn how to bend

01:27:48.364 --> 01:27:49.965
* Your worst inhibitions

01:27:49.998 --> 01:27:52.501
* Tend to psych you out
in the end *

01:27:52.535 --> 01:27:53.969
* I know, you know

01:27:54.002 --> 01:27:58.541
*

01:27:59.305 --> 01:28:05.617
