01:27.133 --> 01:29.100
What are you doing?

01:29.133 --> 01:31.333
We‐Well, cousin, don't worry
about it. They're free.

01:31.366 --> 01:34.233
No, No, Balki.
Those are free.

01:34.266 --> 01:37.466
These are... $3.95?

01:37.800 --> 01:38.766
Sorry.

01:40.533 --> 01:42.500
Oh, n‐no.

01:47.800 --> 01:49.266
We are not here to buy

01:49.300 --> 01:52.100
disgusting little
cheese dogs.

01:52.133 --> 01:55.600
You know, you're the kind of guy
supermarket owners love.

02:00.266 --> 02:01.300
Thank you.

02:03.233 --> 02:05.300
That was not a compliment.

02:05.333 --> 02:08.466
You obviously don't know
the basic rules of shopping.

02:08.500 --> 02:11.700
But, cousin, on Mypos, we don't
have rules for shopping.

02:11.733 --> 02:14.266
Come to think of it,
we don't have rules for games.

02:15.733 --> 02:18.266
This is America.
We have rules for everything.

02:18.300 --> 02:20.033
It's what distinguishes
us from the...

02:21.166 --> 02:22.133
...unrule‐y.

02:23.600 --> 02:25.300
Cousin, will you teach me?

02:25.333 --> 02:27.600
Well, I suppose
I could give you

02:27.633 --> 02:30.600
a few pointers
on comparison shopping.

02:30.633 --> 02:31.633
Well, you're going
to have to because

02:31.666 --> 02:34.766
I don't even know where
they keep the comparison.

02:34.800 --> 02:37.400
Balki, comparison shopping
is when you compare

02:37.433 --> 02:39.333
the price of one item
with another.

02:39.366 --> 02:42.566
For instance, take this rice.
Don't take the rice.

02:44.566 --> 02:46.666
Which package
would you choose?

02:46.700 --> 02:49.366
Well, that one
looks nice.

02:49.400 --> 02:51.300
Very nice
and expensive.

02:51.333 --> 02:55.266
Rule one, don't fall for
the attractive package trick.

02:55.300 --> 02:56.600
You have to
compare prices.

02:56.633 --> 02:59.800
Check the weight.
Find the best value.

02:59.833 --> 03:02.100
‐ Well, where is the best value?
‐ Ah.

03:02.133 --> 03:05.400
That's where this
little baby comes in.

03:05.433 --> 03:07.366
This is the calculator
my father gave me

03:07.400 --> 03:09.666
the first time
I went shopping alone.

03:09.700 --> 03:11.566
Sometime, I'll teach
you how to use it.

03:12.666 --> 03:13.633
Now...

03:14.433 --> 03:17.633
One pound is $1.92.

03:17.666 --> 03:21.266
Divided by 16 ounces,
that would be...

03:21.833 --> 03:23.033
12 cents.

03:25.600 --> 03:26.666
12 cents an ounce.

03:32.500 --> 03:36.733
Alright.
Five pounds is $8.80

03:36.766 --> 03:38.366
that would be...

03:38.400 --> 03:39.400
11 cent.

03:41.733 --> 03:43.266
11 cents an ounce.

03:47.266 --> 03:49.766
Now, the next size is...

03:53.566 --> 03:55.166
That would be
eight cents an ounce.

03:55.200 --> 03:57.533
Therefore this
is the best value.

03:59.466 --> 04:01.633
[grunts]

04:05.100 --> 04:07.166
Cousin, you know,
I‐I can't help noticing

04:07.200 --> 04:09.300
that the best value
weighed 25 pounds.

04:10.466 --> 04:13.033
That's right,
by buying the economy size

04:13.066 --> 04:15.066
we can save
four cents an ounce.

04:15.100 --> 04:16.733
But, cousin we have
only eaten rice

04:16.766 --> 04:19.233
three times
in the last year.

04:19.266 --> 04:22.600
And that means, we won't
have to buy rice again for...

04:24.566 --> 04:25.666
16 years.

04:29.633 --> 04:31.233
16 years.

04:36.600 --> 04:39.566
Now, if you'll notice,
I've arranged the list

04:39.600 --> 04:41.533
according to the four
major food groups.

04:41.566 --> 04:44.400
Wait. Wait, cousin.
Cousin. Cousin. Cousin‐‐

04:44.433 --> 04:46.033
Look, I'm trying to
explain the rules to you.

04:46.066 --> 04:47.266
‐ Yes, yes, yes, but‐but‐‐
‐ Do you mind?

04:47.300 --> 04:49.233
Do you want to learn
about shopping or not?

04:49.266 --> 04:50.666
‐ Do you, do you?
‐ Cousin, cousin‐‐

04:50.700 --> 04:53.600
Do you want to learn
about shopping or not?

04:53.633 --> 04:55.300
‐ Yes, I do but‐‐
‐ Alright, Balki..

04:55.333 --> 04:56.433
‐ Then, Balki, Balki.
‐ Cousin, cousin, cousin‐‐

04:56.466 --> 04:59.466
Just watch and learn.

05:02.166 --> 05:03.700
This is my shopping cart.

05:06.066 --> 05:07.033
Learn how to shop.

05:18.800 --> 05:21.200
Why didn't you tell me
I took the wrong cart?

05:21.233 --> 05:23.700
Because I was busy
watching and learning.

05:30.600 --> 05:32.733
[woman on speaker]
Tuna fish, $1.19.

05:35.700 --> 05:38.000
Macaroni, $1.29.

05:40.266 --> 05:41.500
Did‐did you say something?

05:42.566 --> 05:44.800
That was the cash register.

05:44.833 --> 05:48.066
[woman on speaker]
Peanut butter, $2.49.

05:48.100 --> 05:49.666
Excuse me.

05:49.700 --> 05:52.800
My cousin tell me that
this cash register is talking.

05:52.833 --> 05:54.700
It is.

05:54.733 --> 05:57.433
It's the latest thing
in grocery technology.

05:59.433 --> 06:00.700
Pretty radical, huh?

Your total is $69.25.

06:06.666 --> 06:08.400

Have a nice day.

06:09.633 --> 06:12.033

06:12.600 --> 06:14.500
And they're so polite.

06:16.200 --> 06:17.700
Cousin, isn't this fun?

06:17.733 --> 06:19.133
Yes, tons.

06:20.266 --> 06:21.400
I've got to get
some antacid.

06:22.233 --> 06:24.700
Don't touch anything.

06:26.266 --> 06:27.266
Ah!

06:32.500 --> 06:33.800
How are you today?

06:33.833 --> 06:37.100
Well, my day started out
kind of rough actually.

06:37.133 --> 06:39.033
Cousin Larry wanted
to go shopping

06:39.066 --> 06:41.200
but he didn't want
to take me with him.

06:41.233 --> 06:43.500
So we had kind
of a big fight and

06:43.533 --> 06:45.400
then we got here and...

06:45.433 --> 06:47.033
We've had our ups
and downs, but...

06:49.566 --> 06:52.033
When you come to think of it,
we always have our ups and downs

06:52.066 --> 06:53.433
if you know what I'm saying.

06:53.466 --> 06:55.033
And then over there
he let me push the cart

06:55.066 --> 06:57.533
for about five seconds
which I liked quite a lot.

06:57.566 --> 07:00.733
And so, I‐I'm happy,
you know.

07:02.633 --> 07:04.333
I'm happy.
How are you today?

07:05.766 --> 07:06.766
Fine.

07:13.500 --> 07:16.133

I didn't touch it.

07:16.166 --> 07:17.300
Hi, I'm Pete Zaveni,
the manager.

07:17.333 --> 07:19.100
The manager?
I didn't touch it.

07:19.133 --> 07:21.233
Please‐please don't
call the police.

07:21.266 --> 07:22.500
Balki, what's going on?

07:22.533 --> 07:25.266
Wha‐whatever he did, he's sorry.
Balki, tell them, you're sorry.

07:25.300 --> 07:27.800
I told them, I was sorry,
but she keep throw papers at me.

07:27.833 --> 07:29.266
It's alright, it's alright,
it's alright.

07:29.300 --> 07:31.166
Excuse me. You haven't
done anything wrong.

07:42.766 --> 07:45.266
or whatever we won
and get out of here.

07:49.366 --> 07:51.266
Have we won an oven mitt?

07:53.200 --> 07:55.800
No. You have won our
grand prize shopping spree.

07:55.833 --> 07:58.066
Balki, did you hear that?

07:58.100 --> 08:00.800
Well, of course, I did.
Don't be ridiculous.

08:00.833 --> 08:02.066
You know what this means?

08:02.100 --> 08:03.600
I have no idea.

08:23.166 --> 08:24.166
Hi, cousin.

08:26.466 --> 08:29.533
Where have you been? I have been
waiting for you for two hours.

08:29.566 --> 08:31.666
Oh, cousin, I've been
telling all of our neighbors

08:31.700 --> 08:33.366
about the free
shopping spree.

08:33.400 --> 08:36.666
I'm so excited about all the fun
we're going to have tomorrow

08:36.700 --> 08:39.500
that I don't think I'm going to
be able to sleep a wink tonight.

08:39.533 --> 08:41.566
I don't know how
I'm going to do it.

08:41.600 --> 08:43.033
Maybe I'll just count sheep.

08:43.799 --> 08:45.000
One...

08:49.400 --> 08:52.433
Where do I come up
with them?

08:54.533 --> 08:57.366
Balki, this is no time
to fool around.

08:57.400 --> 08:59.500
Cousin, you know,
you're right?

08:59.533 --> 09:02.400
This is a time
to be serious.

09:07.733 --> 09:09.766
Tomorrow is the time
to fool around.

09:09.800 --> 09:13.200
‐ Dai, dai, dai.
‐ Balki, Balki, get back here.

09:13.233 --> 09:15.533
This shopping spree
is serious business.

09:15.566 --> 09:18.200
Now... I have a plan.

09:20.100 --> 09:23.066
Cousin, why is it that
every time we have

09:23.100 --> 09:26.200
a chance to have fun,
you have to have a plan?

09:27.266 --> 09:29.466
Balki, I don't think
you understand

09:29.500 --> 09:32.500
what kind of opportunity
this shopping spree is.

09:32.533 --> 09:34.466
Oh, but I do,
it's an opportunity

09:34.500 --> 09:37.166
for you to have a plan.

09:39.466 --> 09:41.566
Well, excuse me

09:41.600 --> 09:43.600
for being organized.

09:45.133 --> 09:46.633
What did you think
we would do tomorrow?

09:46.666 --> 09:48.066
Well, do you know
what I thought?

09:48.100 --> 09:51.066
I thought we would run
around the supermarket

09:51.100 --> 09:52.766
and every time
we see something we like

09:52.800 --> 09:54.666
we throw in the cart it.

09:54.700 --> 09:55.766
Oh‐oh!

09:55.800 --> 09:57.266
Just run around
the supermarket

09:57.300 --> 09:59.533
and throw in
the cart things.

09:59.566 --> 10:03.466
Balki, do you know what
we would wind up with?

10:03.500 --> 10:05.200
800 pounds of ding dongs.

10:07.633 --> 10:08.700
Oh, cousin.

10:09.400 --> 10:11.566
That is not fair

10:11.600 --> 10:15.033
and that is not true
and that is not right.

10:16.600 --> 10:18.133
Because I would also
like to pick up

10:18.166 --> 10:19.533
some of those
cheese franks

10:21.233 --> 10:23.500
and some of those potato chips
that taste like tacos.

10:23.533 --> 10:25.133
Alright. Alright.

10:25.166 --> 10:26.000
And some after dinner mints.
Which you..

10:26.033 --> 10:27.500
‐ Yes.
‐ As you know, we're all out.

10:27.533 --> 10:30.466
Alright, alright,
fine, good, good, good.

10:30.500 --> 10:33.033
That is one way to go.

10:33.066 --> 10:36.666
Let us call that plan Z.

10:41.666 --> 10:45.533
Now, let us listen to my plan
which we will call plan A.

10:46.833 --> 10:50.466
Now, I have made a diagram
of the supermarket

10:50.500 --> 10:53.233
and labeled all the sections
where we have to go.

10:54.566 --> 10:57.533
What is‐what is
gour‐gourmet section?

10:57.566 --> 11:00.466
The gourmet section is where
they keep the expensive foods

11:00.500 --> 11:02.700
like caviar and escargot.

11:02.733 --> 11:05.200
‐ Ohh.
‐ Mmm, mmm.

11:05.233 --> 11:06.700
‐ Alright.
‐ What are they?

11:08.766 --> 11:10.533
Caviar and escargot?

11:10.566 --> 11:12.000
Fish eggs and snails.

11:16.633 --> 11:18.600
They are considered delicacies.

11:20.300 --> 11:23.700
Well, on‐on Mypos,
they're considered fertilizer.

11:29.166 --> 11:30.633
I don't want to
eat that stuff.

11:30.666 --> 11:34.200
You can just count me
out and down in Beverly Hills.

11:36.166 --> 11:38.500
Balki, you don't understand.

11:38.533 --> 11:41.133
We are not going
to eat the food.

11:44.266 --> 11:46.633
Well, silly me.

11:46.666 --> 11:49.200
Why would I think
we would eat the food?

11:50.533 --> 11:53.600
This morning I must have got up
on the wrong side of my brain.

11:56.066 --> 11:57.133
If I could just finish?

11:58.266 --> 12:01.500
I stopped by Chez Robert.
And I talked to the chef.

12:01.533 --> 12:03.600
He'll buy everything we get.

12:03.633 --> 12:06.200
We'll sell him the food,
take the money

12:06.233 --> 12:08.366
and buy this.

12:10.133 --> 12:12.000
A living bra.

12:14.400 --> 12:16.600
No. No. This.

12:16.633 --> 12:18.266
An air conditioner.

12:18.300 --> 12:19.600
Oh, cousin

12:19.633 --> 12:22.400
we don't need
an air conditioner.

12:22.433 --> 12:24.766
Balki, have you forgotten
last summer?

12:24.800 --> 12:28.366
Well, of course, I haven't.
Don't be ridiculous.

12:28.400 --> 12:30.733
It was my first
summer in America.

12:30.766 --> 12:34.133
I was drinking in
the sights and sounds

12:34.166 --> 12:35.433
of a new country.

12:35.466 --> 12:36.733
I was learning
the difference

12:36.766 --> 12:39.666
between beta and VHS.

12:42.233 --> 12:43.733
The weather.

12:43.766 --> 12:45.266
The heat.

12:45.300 --> 12:48.166
Do you remember
the heat?

12:48.200 --> 12:49.366
Well, it wasn't
the heat so much.

12:49.400 --> 12:51.600
‐ It was really the humidity.
‐ Oh, God!

12:51.633 --> 12:53.400
You put on a shirt
5 o'clock

12:53.433 --> 12:55.333
in the afternoon
it's wringing wet‐‐

12:55.366 --> 12:57.533
Balki. Balki. Balki.

12:57.566 --> 12:59.033
The point

12:59.066 --> 13:01.600
that I am so desperately

13:01.633 --> 13:03.733
trying to make here

13:03.766 --> 13:05.333
is that we...

13:08.333 --> 13:10.366
‐ The air conditioner?
‐ Yes! Yes!

13:10.400 --> 13:12.233
Yes, the air conditioner.

13:12.266 --> 13:13.766
Balki, look, look, look.

13:13.800 --> 13:16.166
This air conditioner
could cool off

13:16.200 --> 13:19.400
the whole apartment
for the summer.

13:19.433 --> 13:21.066
Especially your room, hmm?

13:22.333 --> 13:24.133
‐ Balki.
‐ My room?

13:24.166 --> 13:26.066
Yes.
Think about it.

13:30.833 --> 13:34.300
Well, maybe
it wouldn't hurt

13:34.333 --> 13:36.666
to give your plan
a little listen.

13:36.700 --> 13:38.500
Yes, thank you.
Thank you. Okay.

13:38.533 --> 13:39.633
Look, now..

13:41.566 --> 13:43.333
We will have one cart
and three minutes

13:43.366 --> 13:44.466
to get as much as we can.

13:44.500 --> 13:45.700
That means,
we'll have to maximize

13:45.733 --> 13:48.033
our value per cubic foot
of cart space.

13:48.066 --> 13:50.233
Now, the rules say
we cannot use any baggage

13:50.266 --> 13:51.666
but it says
nothing about pockets.

13:51.700 --> 13:53.666
So, in the event
we run out of cart space

13:53.700 --> 13:56.300
we will be wearing special
outfits with lots of pockets.

13:56.333 --> 13:59.166
Well, I‐I had a whole outfit
picked out you know..

13:59.200 --> 14:00.566
Well, I‐I‐I'll tell you what,
why don't you just

14:00.600 --> 14:03.533
wear that outfit at some
other shopping spree, okay?

14:06.233 --> 14:08.600
Alright, now, we will hit
the meat department

14:08.633 --> 14:10.733
and go straight
to the expensive cuts.

14:10.766 --> 14:14.400
No ground beef.
I repeat, no hamburger.

14:14.433 --> 14:17.366
Then we'll swing
by the produce section.

14:17.400 --> 14:19.666
The failure of the Cassava
crops has pushed

14:19.700 --> 14:22.366
the price of those melons
right through the roof.

14:22.400 --> 14:24.800
Then it's over
to the gourmet section.

14:24.833 --> 14:26.766
You get the escargot,
I'll get the caviar

14:26.800 --> 14:30.100
if the price of
the white fish is still up

14:30.133 --> 14:31.400
we'll clean them out.

14:32.566 --> 14:34.666
Any questions so far?
Balki.

14:39.833 --> 14:43.533
Does Sylvester Stallone
do his own stunts?

14:47.433 --> 14:48.400
Mmm...

14:50.166 --> 14:52.066
Uh, what‐what
I meant was

14:52.100 --> 14:54.166
are there any

14:54.200 --> 14:56.700
questions about
the shopping spree?

14:58.666 --> 15:00.200
Ohh, oh, oh!

15:00.233 --> 15:01.366
No, no, not a one.

15:06.533 --> 15:08.133
Good.

15:08.166 --> 15:11.466
Alright, let's go back
and analyze each section.

15:11.500 --> 15:12.533
When we get to the...

15:21.533 --> 15:23.300
‐ Cute outfits.
‐ Well, thank you.

15:23.333 --> 15:25.133
They're part of
Cousin Larry's plan.

15:25.166 --> 15:27.500
You know we can carry
twice our body weight.

15:31.803 --> 15:33.570
We're about to start.

15:33.603 --> 15:36.003
Uh, Mary Ann, do you need
anything besides the shampoo?

15:36.036 --> 15:38.036
Oh, no, thanks. I think
I'm fine on conditioner.

15:39.036 --> 15:40.936
Well, Larry,
do you think you'll have

15:40.970 --> 15:42.570
enough time to get
my nail polish?

15:43.970 --> 15:45.003
Nail polish?

15:45.036 --> 15:47.636
Cousin, I told the girls
we'll get them a few things.

15:50.570 --> 15:51.536
Super.

15:53.570 --> 15:56.670
Uh, Balki, could I speak to
you for just a moment?

15:58.436 --> 15:59.670
Excuse us.

16:03.103 --> 16:05.170
What are you doing?

16:05.203 --> 16:06.403
Well, I thought
it would be nice

16:06.436 --> 16:07.903
to get some things
for our neighbors.

16:07.936 --> 16:09.536
We can't do that!

16:09.570 --> 16:11.803
But Mrs. Schlegelmitz
needs some salami.

16:11.836 --> 16:13.803
Balki, we only have
three minutes

16:13.836 --> 16:15.170
to get everything
on our list.

16:15.203 --> 16:16.670
But cousin, I promised.

16:16.703 --> 16:18.903
Well, well,
you shouldn't have.

16:18.936 --> 16:21.970
Balki, this is going
to throw the plan way off.

16:22.003 --> 16:23.936
Well, then we just
change the plan.

16:23.970 --> 16:25.836
Change the plan?

16:27.003 --> 16:29.970
We can't change the plan
right before we start.

16:30.003 --> 16:32.103
Why do you think
they call it a plan?

16:34.903 --> 16:37.936
Ladies and gentlemen, may I have
your attention, please?

16:37.970 --> 16:40.036
The contest is about to begin.

16:40.070 --> 16:42.003
Gather round.
Gather round.

16:42.036 --> 16:44.536
Welcome to our
Grand Opening Celebration.

16:44.570 --> 16:47.570
I'd like to introduce you
to our shopping spree winners

16:47.603 --> 16:50.036
Mr. Balki Bartokomous.

16:50.070 --> 16:52.636
Y‐a‐a‐ay.

16:52.670 --> 16:54.003
[Pete]
And Mr. Larry Appleton.

16:54.036 --> 16:55.903
Y‐a‐a‐ay.

16:56.970 --> 16:58.603
Now, remember, boys

16:58.636 --> 17:01.070
you will have exactly
three minutes

17:01.103 --> 17:02.736
to cross this finish line

17:02.770 --> 17:05.470
before the buzzer sounds,
or you lose everything.

17:05.502 --> 17:06.703
Shoppers, take your marks.

17:06.736 --> 17:08.903
Cousin, you know,
I‐I don't understand

17:08.935 --> 17:11.670
why we don't we have time
to be nice to our neighbors?

17:11.703 --> 17:13.470
I'll tell you what,
we'll throw them a dinner party.

17:13.502 --> 17:15.736
Stick to the plan.

17:15.770 --> 17:17.569
Ready.

17:17.603 --> 17:19.736
Set.

17:19.770 --> 17:21.170
Shop.

17:21.203 --> 17:24.369
[all cheering]

17:25.636 --> 17:27.903
Balki. Balki. Balki.

17:28.936 --> 17:31.103
Balki, where are you going?

17:31.136 --> 17:33.136
Well, I thought I would get
Mary Ann's shampoo before I‐‐

17:33.170 --> 17:34.670
You can get it later.

17:34.703 --> 17:36.536
Stick to the plan.

17:39.736 --> 17:40.703
Roasts!

17:40.736 --> 17:42.070
Three.

17:42.103 --> 17:43.570
Roast one.

17:43.603 --> 17:44.803
Roast two.

17:44.836 --> 17:46.036
‐ Roast three.
‐ Ham.

17:46.070 --> 17:47.170
Four.

17:47.203 --> 17:48.670
Ham one.

17:48.703 --> 17:49.970
Ham two.

17:50.003 --> 17:51.470
Ham three.

17:51.503 --> 17:52.570
‐ Ham four.
‐ Turkey!

17:52.603 --> 17:53.836
Three, oh, God.

17:53.870 --> 17:55.570
Turkey one.

17:55.603 --> 17:57.003
Turkey two.

17:57.036 --> 17:58.736
‐ Turkey three.
‐ Pheasants!

17:58.770 --> 18:01.670
Nine. Salami!

18:01.703 --> 18:04.436
I told Mrs. Schlegelmitz
and she said

18:04.470 --> 18:06.936
to me she said, "Balki,
if you get a chance, baby

18:06.970 --> 18:08.403
you gotta pick up some of that."

18:08.436 --> 18:10.736
Because she's going to make
antipasto for her son.

18:10.770 --> 18:12.970
Balki, forget the salami.

18:13.003 --> 18:14.836
We've got to get
to the casabas.

18:14.870 --> 18:15.836
Oh!

18:15.870 --> 18:16.636
Two minutes.

18:19.170 --> 18:20.936
But what about
Mary Ann's shampoo?

18:20.970 --> 18:22.070
Cousin, it's right over there.

18:22.103 --> 18:23.703
We just have to get it..

18:24.970 --> 18:27.436
Forget the shampoo.

18:27.470 --> 18:29.136
‐ Stop it, it's getting..
‐ We've got to get to the‐‐

18:29.170 --> 18:30.403
Cousin, don't.

18:30.436 --> 18:31.970
Now, listen.
Here is the shampoo.

18:32.003 --> 18:34.403
‐ Alright. Alright.
‐ Right here.

18:34.436 --> 18:36.436
‐ Come on, Balki, alright.
‐ Right there.

18:37.503 --> 18:38.936
Squeeze bottle or tube?

18:39.970 --> 18:41.903
Alright, alright. Here.

18:43.803 --> 18:44.670
Shampoo!

18:44.703 --> 18:46.836
Now, let's get
to the gourmet section.

18:46.870 --> 18:49.870
Oh, wait, I see the‐the diapers
for Mrs. Fargey..

18:49.903 --> 18:53.003
No, no, Balki, Balki, Balki.
Alright, get the diapers.

18:53.036 --> 18:54.103
Get the diapers.

18:57.136 --> 19:00.936
Balki, whitefish,
$19.95 a pound.

19:06.936 --> 19:08.670
Looks like spawning season.

19:18.203 --> 19:19.403
Oh.

19:20.703 --> 19:22.570
30 seconds.

19:22.603 --> 19:25.703
We have 30 seconds
to get the caviar.

19:25.736 --> 19:28.436
But, cousin, if we don't
go, if we don't go right now

19:28.470 --> 19:31.103
we'll lose everything we‐we'll
lose everything we got.

19:33.603 --> 19:35.736
I'm not leaving
without the caviar.

19:35.770 --> 19:37.603
Oh, but, oh, cousin..

19:37.636 --> 19:39.003
Ten seconds.

19:41.536 --> 19:42.736
[Pete]
Five..

19:42.770 --> 19:45.003
Four, three.

19:45.036 --> 19:47.936
Two, one.

19:47.970 --> 19:49.903
[cheering]
Yeah!

19:57.736 --> 20:00.670
[instrumental music]

20:03.070 --> 20:05.470
Balki, we did it.

20:05.503 --> 20:07.903
$635.

20:08.770 --> 20:10.003
Cousin, that's enough to buy

20:10.036 --> 20:12.103
the air conditioner
and the living bra.

20:15.070 --> 20:16.636
And we had fun, too.

20:17.870 --> 20:18.836
You had fun?

20:20.470 --> 20:22.636
Well, always, cousin.
Always.

20:22.670 --> 20:25.070
That's why they call me
"The Jerry Lewis of Mypos."

20:31.136 --> 20:34.536
Why is it always work for me
and fun for you?

20:35.536 --> 20:37.770
Well, I don't know,
cousin. Um...

20:37.803 --> 20:40.503
Maybe because you spend
so much time making plans

20:40.536 --> 20:42.536
and you don't leave
enough time to have fun.

20:42.570 --> 20:43.736
‐ Now, that's not true.
‐ Oh, cousin.

20:43.770 --> 20:46.970
‐ That's not true...
‐ Oh, cousin, alright.

20:47.003 --> 20:48.070
What are you going
to do now?

20:48.103 --> 20:51.403
You're going to make a plan
to buy an air conditioner.

20:51.436 --> 20:52.836
But that only makes sense.

20:52.870 --> 20:54.836
You've gotta
comparison shop.

20:54.870 --> 20:56.836
You've gotta
find the best deal.

20:56.870 --> 20:59.570
Yes, but, cousin, you're
not going to have any fun.

20:59.603 --> 21:00.970
I'll have an
air conditioner.

21:01.003 --> 21:03.736
Yes, but you're
not going to have any fun.

21:03.770 --> 21:05.603
I'll have an
air conditioner.

21:05.636 --> 21:07.536
Alright, cousin.
Do you want to have fun?

21:07.570 --> 21:08.936
‐ Do you? Do you?
‐ Oh. Oh.

21:08.970 --> 21:10.503
Do you want to have fun?

21:10.536 --> 21:11.570
Yes, I do.

21:14.436 --> 21:15.836
Alright.
Now, listen.

21:15.870 --> 21:17.703
On Mypos, we have a saying.

21:17.736 --> 21:19.936
[speaking in foreign language]

21:22.103 --> 21:25.070
[speaking in foreign language]

21:27.603 --> 21:28.703
Need I say more?

21:33.770 --> 21:34.936
A little more
might be helpful.

21:37.436 --> 21:40.403
It says,
"If you let your hair down

21:40.436 --> 21:42.770
you might be surprised
what you find in it."

21:51.803 --> 21:53.936
You know, Balki

21:53.970 --> 21:56.703
in your own odd way

21:58.536 --> 21:59.536
you're right.

22:02.103 --> 22:05.170
And you are going
to teach me

22:05.203 --> 22:06.636
how to loosen up.

22:06.670 --> 22:08.803
I am?
How I do that?

22:10.203 --> 22:12.770
I'm going to give you
this money.

22:12.803 --> 22:15.536
I want you to spend
every last penny of it.

22:15.570 --> 22:16.570
‐ But cousin‐‐
‐ And.

22:16.603 --> 22:17.903
I don't care how you do it.

22:17.936 --> 22:19.170
'Cause I know
whatever you do

22:19.203 --> 22:22.036
it'll be fun,
a little bit crazy

22:22.070 --> 22:24.003
and totally spontaneous.

22:24.036 --> 22:25.970
Well, cousin, I...

22:26.003 --> 22:28.803
635 smackeroos.

22:30.170 --> 22:32.736
You know,
I feel terrific.

22:32.770 --> 22:34.670
I feel as if
this‐this great weight

22:34.703 --> 22:35.736
has been lifted
from my shoulders.

22:35.770 --> 22:37.703
Well, you know,
I do, too.

22:37.736 --> 22:39.870
[laughing]

22:39.903 --> 22:40.936
‐ Ahh...
‐ Ahh...

22:44.103 --> 22:45.070
Well...

22:46.070 --> 22:48.136
So, uh, Balki, uh...

22:48.170 --> 22:50.103
Well, what are you gonna do
with all that money?

22:51.536 --> 22:53.703
Wait a minute, do you mean,
do I have a plan?

22:53.736 --> 22:56.070
No, no, no.
No, that's not what I mean.

22:56.103 --> 22:57.303
Just that if, uh,
I'm gonna learn

22:57.336 --> 23:00.870
how to be less rigid, I wanna
know how you're gonna do it

23:00.903 --> 23:02.970
in a very loosely structured

23:03.003 --> 23:06.403
you know, free kind of way.

23:06.436 --> 23:07.870
Well, I'll tell you.

23:11.970 --> 23:13.970
Mary Ann is going to have
a birthday soon.

23:14.003 --> 23:17.136
And I thought what I would do
is rent one of those aero planes

23:17.170 --> 23:19.603
that spit smoke
out of the back end

23:19.636 --> 23:21.003
and write in the sky.

23:21.036 --> 23:22.570
And I would have it say

23:22.603 --> 23:25.003
"Happy birthday, Mary Ann

23:25.036 --> 23:27.003
from guess who."

23:27.036 --> 23:29.536
