00:02.754 --> 00:04.631
I want to reassure you.

00:04.756 --> 00:07.717
Your child can have
a completely normal life.

00:09.552 --> 00:12.180
How can a baby have
male and female DNA?

00:13.431 --> 00:16.184
It's a condition
called genetic mosaicism.

00:17.227 --> 00:20.563
The ambiguous genitalia
can be surgically repaired.

00:21.231 --> 00:22.565
Repaired?

00:23.400 --> 00:25.402
Made to look more typical.

00:26.986 --> 00:28.571
More typical?

00:29.072 --> 00:32.617
But you haven't even
told us if the baby's a boy or a girl.

00:34.160 --> 00:36.579
That's a choice
you have to make.

00:41.000 --> 00:42.752
(CROWD CHEERING)

00:44.129 --> 00:46.589
Nice job, Jackson.

00:51.428 --> 00:52.470
Take it.

01:01.354 --> 01:03.773
He had the shot.
He lost his nerve.

01:03.898 --> 01:05.316
Honey, it's okay.
He's doing great.

01:10.321 --> 01:11.531
Three.

01:25.086 --> 01:26.629

(CROWD CHEERING)

01:31.426 --> 01:32.635
No fear that time.

01:43.730 --> 01:45.064
Melanie.

01:46.107 --> 01:48.234
Oh, my God. Jackson!

01:49.194 --> 01:50.737
(CROWD MURMURING)

02:29.526 --> 02:31.277
(BOTH CHUCKLING)

02:32.737 --> 02:34.739
Black heels or the boots?

02:36.658 --> 02:38.910
You know I'm a fan
of those heels.

02:39.494 --> 02:40.578
Boots it is.

02:44.499 --> 02:47.752
For all we know, House knows you're
a fan of those heels.

02:47.877 --> 02:49.170
You think House is
going to figure out

02:49.295 --> 02:52.131
we faked our break-up
because of your shoes?

02:53.967 --> 02:55.593
Go with the boots.

02:59.639 --> 03:00.723
You gonna eat that?

03:00.974 --> 03:02.517
Have at it.

03:03.601 --> 03:06.521
Did you just ask my permission
before you took my food?

03:06.646 --> 03:07.897
Yes, we can.

03:08.731 --> 03:11.317
Adolescent genetic mosaic,
collapsed during a basketball game,

03:11.442 --> 03:14.195
presenting with
persistent pelvic pain.

03:14.320 --> 03:15.405
Fun.

03:15.530 --> 03:17.866
The parents haven't told their son
that he could have been their daughter.

03:17.991 --> 03:20.535
They want assurance
that you won't either.

03:20.660 --> 03:22.328
Less fun. But still.

03:30.461 --> 03:31.880
That was easy.

03:33.590 --> 03:37.677
Our new patient.
Part girl, part boy,

03:38.428 --> 03:40.597
all Thirteen's dream date.

03:41.598 --> 03:45.435
Severe pelvic pain started during a
basketball game. Could be dehydration.

03:45.560 --> 03:47.437
ER gave him fluids
when he came in.

03:47.562 --> 03:48.730
FOREMAN: Still,
if it was chronic...

03:48.855 --> 03:50.690
We got a kid who could mate
with himself, and we're thinking

03:50.815 --> 03:51.858
he didn't have
enough to drink?

03:51.983 --> 03:53.818
There are dozens
of intersex disorders.

03:53.943 --> 03:58.865
Persistent pelvic pain could mean
congenital adrenal hyperplasia, PMDS.

03:58.990 --> 04:00.742
Those conditions occur
in intersex kids

04:00.867 --> 04:04.329
who are chromosomally
XX or XY, not XX and XY.

04:04.454 --> 04:06.915
Parents recently started him on
testosterone, maybe there's something...

04:07.040 --> 04:09.375
Vitamins wouldn't
cause pelvic pain.

04:11.794 --> 04:12.629
There's a note in here.

04:12.754 --> 04:15.715
We're supposed to refer to his
testosterone shots as vitamins.

04:15.840 --> 04:17.008
His parents aren't just liars.

04:17.133 --> 04:18.593
They want us to be liars, too.

04:19.010 --> 04:22.472
I won't do it.
You guys will, though.

04:22.597 --> 04:24.891
He's a kid. Parents don't think
he's ready to deal with it.

04:25.016 --> 04:28.269
My dad was the same way about me maybe
having Huntington's. It's...

04:28.394 --> 04:30.438
Well, if that was
your experience,

04:30.563 --> 04:32.982
it must surely apply
in this situation.

04:34.025 --> 04:36.819
Pain could be caused
by a blind uterus hidden in his abdomen.

04:36.945 --> 04:37.862
He needs an MRI.

04:37.987 --> 04:40.406
FOREMAN: Right.
Boy with girl genes.

04:40.531 --> 04:44.535
I'm sure you're the first doctor
brilliant enough to check for a uterus.

04:44.661 --> 04:46.704
He could have complications
from the surgeries on his penis.

04:46.829 --> 04:47.914
That can cause
pelvic pain.

04:48.039 --> 04:49.832
Way to multi-task.

04:49.958 --> 04:52.085
Impress your boss
and humiliate your ex.

04:53.002 --> 04:54.420
MRI is a waste of time.

04:54.545 --> 04:56.130
But to continue
the humiliation,

04:56.255 --> 04:58.299
go put a camera
up his penis.

05:00.843 --> 05:03.221
You're Dr. House,
aren't you?

05:03.346 --> 05:05.056
What do you think
is wrong with our son?

05:07.308 --> 05:09.894
These people were just
coming to tell you.

05:10.019 --> 05:11.521
This is better.

05:11.646 --> 05:13.856
Don't have to worry about
them losing their way.

05:13.982 --> 05:17.944
We think that he has a blind uterus.
He should have an MRI.

05:18.653 --> 05:19.904
Did you send them a text?

05:20.029 --> 05:23.032
Over the past 13 years,
we've educated ourselves.

05:24.033 --> 05:27.120
Who needs med school
when you've got Wi-Fi?

05:27.245 --> 05:31.040
Go schedule their son
for an MRI with contrast right away.

05:31.666 --> 05:33.376
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

05:35.586 --> 05:37.213
You just said an MRI
was a waste of time.

05:37.338 --> 05:39.340
So is arguing with them.

05:42.760 --> 05:44.137
THIRTEEN: Contrast's in.

05:44.804 --> 05:47.598
Jackson, we're going
to get started, so try to lie still.

05:50.643 --> 05:54.731
How long do you think the post-break-up
awkwardness is going to last?

05:55.398 --> 05:57.859
Foreman and I are
both professionals.

05:57.984 --> 05:59.902
Stomach and liver
are clear.

06:00.028 --> 06:04.824
If by "professional" you mean he's a
T-1000 built by Cyberdyne Systems.

06:04.949 --> 06:06.909
I never understood
what you saw in him.

06:07.035 --> 06:08.953
He's not really
your type, huh?

06:09.078 --> 06:10.663
Moving down through
the pelvic floor.

06:10.788 --> 06:14.751
Here's my impression of Foreman
on the happiest day of his life.

06:17.670 --> 06:20.089
Now, the saddest day
of his life.

06:21.632 --> 06:25.136
We just broke up. I'm not quite ready
to mock him yet.

06:26.721 --> 06:28.765
House was a jerk
to split you two up,

06:28.890 --> 06:32.018
but bottom line,
he did you a favor.

06:32.810 --> 06:35.146
Area around the
intestinal tract is clear.

06:35.271 --> 06:36.898
No blind uterus.

06:40.318 --> 06:41.652
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

06:43.905 --> 06:47.450
I think there's
something wrong with House.

06:47.575 --> 06:49.285
Who's he making
miserable now?

06:49.410 --> 06:50.703
Actually, no one.

06:50.828 --> 06:51.913
He okayed an MRI

06:52.038 --> 06:55.333
just because the parents wanted to look
for a blind uterus.

06:55.458 --> 06:57.960
There was no fighting,
no arguing, he just went along.

06:58.086 --> 06:59.754
It's a valid
medical theory.

06:59.879 --> 07:01.631
He doesn't think it is.

07:02.173 --> 07:05.176
House decided to
humor these parents.

07:06.552 --> 07:08.679
Maybe he had
a great cup of coffee,

07:08.805 --> 07:10.473
or a tremendous
bowel movement.

07:11.224 --> 07:13.559
Bottom line is,
your boss is in a good mood.

07:13.684 --> 07:16.062
Stop analyzing it
and just enjoy it.

07:23.569 --> 07:26.531
We're going to use this scope
to fill your bladder with saline,

07:26.656 --> 07:29.200
then examine your urethra
for any narrow spots.

07:29.325 --> 07:31.661
Why would there be
a narrow spot?

07:32.495 --> 07:34.539
Sometimes it
just happens.

07:36.124 --> 07:37.583
Can my parents come in?

07:37.708 --> 07:38.626
Sure.

07:40.378 --> 07:42.964
I thought it'd be awkward for you
having them here.

07:43.089 --> 07:46.259
I have this feeling
they've seen me naked before.

07:47.760 --> 07:50.805
Now, take a breath,
just try to relax.

07:54.851 --> 07:56.102
Mom.

07:58.729 --> 08:00.731
It's okay, honey.
It's okay.

08:02.441 --> 08:05.987
Hey, remember those sprints
they made you run in practice?

08:06.112 --> 08:10.241
Those were so hard,
but you pulled through.

08:11.492 --> 08:13.286
You can do this, too.

08:15.621 --> 08:17.665
I'm to the bladder.
Start the saline.

08:20.835 --> 08:21.961
(WHIMPERS)

08:22.920 --> 08:25.590
I'm going to look around
and pull back on the scope.

08:27.967 --> 08:29.010
Feels tight.

08:29.135 --> 08:29.969
THIRTEEN:
That pressure's normal.

08:30.094 --> 08:32.722
Just try to hold on
for a few more minutes.

08:32.847 --> 08:34.640
It's not down there.

08:35.266 --> 08:36.517
It's my chest.

08:36.642 --> 08:38.477
(MACHINE BEEPING RAPIDLY)

08:38.811 --> 08:42.899
I can't breathe.
Can't... Can't breathe.

08:43.482 --> 08:44.400
Is he okay?

08:44.692 --> 08:45.860
Muffled heart sounds.

08:46.652 --> 08:48.571
- Jugular's distended.
- Pericardial effusion.

08:48.696 --> 08:49.697
We need a 10 gauge
and a syringe.

08:49.822 --> 08:50.656
MELANIE: What's happening?

08:50.781 --> 08:51.866
His heart is filling
with exudate.

08:51.991 --> 08:54.118
If we don't drain it,
it'll stop beating.

08:54.243 --> 08:55.661
(GRUNTING)

09:00.583 --> 09:02.752
We drained the fluid
from his pericardial space.

09:02.877 --> 09:04.003
His heart rate
is back to normal.

09:04.212 --> 09:05.755
Pelvis plus heart.

09:05.880 --> 09:08.591
Doesn't fit with any of the syndromes
associated with mosaicism.

09:08.716 --> 09:11.385
FOREMAN: It could be drugs,
toxins, an infection.

09:12.011 --> 09:13.054
You're okay with this?

09:13.179 --> 09:14.180
With what?

09:14.305 --> 09:18.100
That we're considering a diagnosis
unrelated to this kid being a she-male.

09:18.517 --> 09:20.770
Assuming a coincidence
like that would usually torture you,

09:20.895 --> 09:22.146
but you're
completely unfazed.

09:22.480 --> 09:26.567
Completely unfazed? You think
I'm totally lacking in any fazing?

09:27.193 --> 09:31.364
The idea that I'm anything less than
half-fazed, I actually find offensive.

09:31.489 --> 09:32.573
It greatly fazes me.

09:32.698 --> 09:34.033
He started testosterone...

09:34.158 --> 09:35.368
Vitamins.

09:35.493 --> 09:37.870
...a few months ago.
That can cause autoimmune diseases

09:37.995 --> 09:39.538
like polyarteritis and SLE,

09:39.664 --> 09:45.044
which can cause pericardial effusion
and pelvic pain. So, it is related.

09:46.545 --> 09:48.339
Now I'm unfazed.

09:48.464 --> 09:51.092
Start him on corticosteroids
for the autoimmune,

09:51.217 --> 09:53.469
finasteride to block
the vitamins.

10:00.351 --> 10:02.353
You slept with House.

10:03.312 --> 10:05.731
He asked permission
before taking my bagel,

10:05.856 --> 10:07.566
took the case
without a fight,

10:07.692 --> 10:10.111
honored the parents'
request for an MRI.

10:10.236 --> 10:12.822
Yes, those were my terms
for sleeping with him.

10:12.947 --> 10:14.365
He's in a good mood.

10:14.490 --> 10:16.951
Sex with me
would explain that,

10:17.076 --> 10:21.706
but it doesn't explain why I'm not
curled up in a ball, weeping in shame.

10:21.831 --> 10:23.624
I did not have
sex with House.

10:23.749 --> 10:25.459
If you two aren't keeping
something from me,

10:25.584 --> 10:29.213
that means he's keeping
something from both of us.

10:29.338 --> 10:31.215
- That can't be good.
- Or he's just in a good mood.

10:31.340 --> 10:32.967
This is not a crisis.

10:33.092 --> 10:36.429
Maybe you can get back
some of that money he owes you.

10:38.472 --> 10:39.724
Hmm.

10:41.684 --> 10:43.185
(SIGHS)

10:43.644 --> 10:45.479
Testosterone blocker?

10:45.604 --> 10:50.276
Does that mean if Jackson has SLE,
or whatever that other thing was,

10:50.401 --> 10:52.737
that he'd have to go
off the hormones?

10:52.862 --> 10:54.238
Probably.

10:54.363 --> 10:56.407
Then Jackson
will stop developing,

10:56.532 --> 10:58.492
he'll never go
through puberty.

10:58.617 --> 11:00.619
Maybe this isn't
what's wrong with him,

11:00.745 --> 11:02.204
maybe the testosterone
didn't cause it.

11:02.413 --> 11:05.249
Yeah. But if it is,
then he'll never be a man.

11:05.875 --> 11:07.251
(CHUCKLES)

11:07.376 --> 11:09.337
Did we make
the wrong choice?

11:16.427 --> 11:20.598
You'll need to tell him the testosterone
blocker is something else.

11:22.183 --> 11:25.728
Or maybe this is a good opportunity
to tell him the truth.

11:25.853 --> 11:29.357
It might make it simpler
for all of you.

11:29.982 --> 11:32.318
You want us to tell
a sick adolescent boy

11:32.443 --> 11:36.155
that he's really not an adolescent boy?

11:36.280 --> 11:38.616
That doesn't seem
simpler to me.

11:40.993 --> 11:43.162
No. Just

11:45.456 --> 11:47.458
give him the meds.

11:49.627 --> 11:54.799
So, you have
pain in one arm and both your legs.

11:55.424 --> 11:56.717
Does it hurt right now?

11:56.842 --> 11:57.885
No.

11:58.260 --> 12:01.472
It's when I, like,
put pressure on them.

12:01.931 --> 12:05.267
See, it hurts
when I do this.

12:05.893 --> 12:07.269
Ow!

12:08.020 --> 12:09.230
And this.

12:10.564 --> 12:11.649
Ow!

12:13.067 --> 12:14.402
And this.

12:16.028 --> 12:17.238
Ow!

12:19.365 --> 12:20.449
What about this?

12:20.574 --> 12:22.368
(SCREAMING) Ow!

12:27.039 --> 12:29.750
Did you give House the moron
with the broken finger?

12:29.875 --> 12:31.502
They've been in Room 2
about 10 minutes.

12:31.627 --> 12:36.257
The patient should've been screaming
for another doctor seven minutes ago.

12:40.261 --> 12:41.887
Thanks, bro.

12:53.983 --> 12:57.027
If I have this IV,
why do I need a shot, too?

12:58.737 --> 13:01.740
Just some extra medicine,
just to be safe.

13:03.534 --> 13:05.703
I hear you're quite
the basketball player.

13:05.828 --> 13:07.788
- What position?
- Point guard.

13:07.913 --> 13:11.000
Small forward.
How's your crossover dribble?

13:11.125 --> 13:14.211
It's okay. I'm not really
that into basketball.

13:14.587 --> 13:17.089
Gonna feel
a little pinch, okay?

13:18.883 --> 13:22.303
So, if you're not that into it,
why'd you join the team?

13:25.389 --> 13:27.016
My mom kind of
made me do it.

13:27.141 --> 13:28.767
My parents
were the same way,

13:28.893 --> 13:31.061
always pushing me
to try new things.

13:31.187 --> 13:34.398
It was more like
what she didn't want me to try.

13:35.274 --> 13:38.444
I wanted to take dance,
but she flipped out,

13:38.569 --> 13:41.489
and made me choose
between basketball and hockey.

13:42.531 --> 13:43.824
What does your dad say?

13:43.949 --> 13:47.620
He seemed okay with it,
then he just caved in to my mom.

13:51.081 --> 13:53.167
Your palm is red.

13:53.292 --> 13:55.002
What does that mean?

13:57.379 --> 14:00.466
That we still don't know
what's wrong with you.

14:04.678 --> 14:07.556
You were right,
he is in a good mood.

14:15.689 --> 14:17.775
Bummer it didn't work out
with you and Thirteen.

14:18.234 --> 14:19.235
It happens.

14:19.360 --> 14:20.945
You guys seemed
happy together.

14:21.070 --> 14:24.198
It's probably for the best, you know,
the bisexual thing and all.

14:24.323 --> 14:25.157
That was never an issue.

14:25.282 --> 14:27.785
No, it never is.
Until it is.

14:27.910 --> 14:30.579
This is Thirteen.
Before you guys got together,

14:30.704 --> 14:33.249
she was hooking up
with a different girl every night.

14:33.624 --> 14:37.336
Long term, you really think
you could compete with that?

14:39.338 --> 14:41.757
House, wake up.
We have to talk.

14:42.550 --> 14:45.427
Stop pretending
to be asleep, we're not leaving.

14:45.553 --> 14:46.845
House.

14:49.139 --> 14:50.766
What's going on?

14:51.517 --> 14:52.851
WILSON: House?

14:55.521 --> 14:57.189
- He's not breathing.
- Can you get a pulse?

14:57.314 --> 14:58.524
- Barely.
- Call a code.

14:58.649 --> 15:00.317
WILSON: Get an Ambu bag
from the nurse's station.

15:00.442 --> 15:02.570
FOREMAN: Heart's still working,
means synapses are still firing.

15:02.695 --> 15:04.989
We just need to get
a message through to him.

15:05.197 --> 15:06.407
(SCREAMS)

15:06.699 --> 15:08.075
(GASPING)

15:13.289 --> 15:15.499
You stopped breathing.

15:15.624 --> 15:17.209
What the hell is going on?

15:25.134 --> 15:27.928
I think my penis
stopped breathing. Do you know CPR?

15:28.053 --> 15:29.471
Looks like
your brain is okay.

15:29.597 --> 15:31.682
Pupils are equal,
round and reactive.

15:31.807 --> 15:36.145
I'm fine, other than the fact
that my nurple is now purple.

15:36.520 --> 15:37.896
No wonder you
broke up with him.

15:38.022 --> 15:40.316
I'm surprised yours
are still attached.

15:40.441 --> 15:43.527
By the way,
I could see that from here.

15:43.652 --> 15:45.446
I assume those are our
patient's lab results.

15:45.571 --> 15:47.364
The patient can wait.
You could have died.

15:47.489 --> 15:50.826
The only reason you'd ignore a
near-death experience is you don't care,

15:50.951 --> 15:52.703
or you already know
why it happened.

15:52.828 --> 15:55.539
It's called Vicodin.
I took too many.

15:55.664 --> 15:58.542
Can I please get
some information about our patient?

15:58.667 --> 16:01.837
The patient's palms are red. Lab test
confirmed liver and kidney dysfunction.

16:01.962 --> 16:03.672
I don't remember you
taking any Vicodin today.

16:03.797 --> 16:05.883
I don't remember
hiring my mother.

16:06.008 --> 16:07.509
And what causes
the enzymes in

16:07.635 --> 16:10.471
little Boy George's existing
heart problem and pelvic pain?

16:10.596 --> 16:13.223
You didn't take any yesterday
at breakfast, either.

16:13.349 --> 16:15.100
I don't remember
having breakfast with my mother.

16:15.225 --> 16:17.353
Amyloidosis with
systemic involvement.

16:17.478 --> 16:19.688
Protein levels are normal.
This kid's depressed.

16:19.813 --> 16:21.732
If he's self-medicating
with drugs and alcohol,

16:21.857 --> 16:23.108
that'd explain
his symptoms.

16:23.233 --> 16:24.818
Search the school.
Search the home.

16:24.943 --> 16:26.570
Seriously? Or are you
just deflecting?

16:26.695 --> 16:28.113
Both.

16:31.825 --> 16:33.535
- Where are you going?
- Nowhere.

16:33.661 --> 16:37.081
I'm staying right here,
so we can properly discuss this.

16:40.334 --> 16:42.628
- He's on heroin.
- How can you...

16:42.753 --> 16:45.506
Number one, he's happy,
which means he's high.

16:45.631 --> 16:49.301
Number two, when he moved his bad leg,
he didn't use his hands to support it.

16:49.426 --> 16:52.596
Whatever he's taking,
it's stronger than Vicodin.

16:53.263 --> 16:55.015
What are we gonna do?

16:58.435 --> 17:00.729
You really think House
took too many Vicodin?

17:00.854 --> 17:04.900
Guy pops them like candy. I'm surprised
it hasn't happened before.

17:05.567 --> 17:08.237
Do you miss
sleeping with women?

17:08.362 --> 17:10.739
- Excuse me?
- Simple question.

17:11.365 --> 17:13.909
Yes. It's a simple answer.

17:15.452 --> 17:17.579
I'll check under the bed.

17:20.416 --> 17:23.001
I also miss
sleeping with other men,

17:23.335 --> 17:25.921
and I'm sure you miss sleeping
with other women.

17:26.046 --> 17:29.216
Monogamy is like saying
you're never going to have

17:29.341 --> 17:32.219
any other ice cream flavor
besides Rocky Road.

17:32.344 --> 17:35.848
So, you're saying if you don't have
pink bubblegum for a while,

17:35.973 --> 17:38.267
that one day you're
gonna chase down the ice cream truck?

17:38.392 --> 17:41.228
No, Rocky Road is great.

17:42.104 --> 17:46.316
It's a very delicious
and complicated flavor.

17:46.900 --> 17:48.736
I also know that if
I have other flavors,

17:48.861 --> 17:52.906
then Rocky Road is gonna be left in the
freezer where anyone can just dip in.

17:53.031 --> 17:55.200
Can we please
drop the metaphor?

17:56.744 --> 17:58.829
Why is this
coming up now?

17:59.705 --> 18:01.749
Kutner said the silver lining
of our break-up

18:01.874 --> 18:04.418
was I wouldn't
be dumped for a girl.

18:05.210 --> 18:06.295
There's nothing
in here, either.

18:06.420 --> 18:08.464
Seems like you're wrong
about this kid having drug or alcohol...

18:08.589 --> 18:10.549
When did he bring that up?

18:10.674 --> 18:12.134
Earlier today,
right before...

18:12.259 --> 18:14.636
This morning,
Taub called you a robot.

18:14.762 --> 18:15.846
Hmm.

18:16.597 --> 18:18.182
Either it's
a big coincidence

18:18.307 --> 18:22.060
or they're jerking us
around, they know.

18:22.269 --> 18:24.980
And if they know,
House knows.

18:26.190 --> 18:27.816
This is bad.

18:27.941 --> 18:30.194
No, this is good.

18:31.862 --> 18:34.698
House only has two ways to handle
us still going out.

18:34.907 --> 18:36.742
He jerks us around
or he fires us.

18:36.867 --> 18:40.120
He chose option A.
This is good.

18:45.793 --> 18:47.377
But this is bad.

18:49.213 --> 18:54.760
"I stand alone, my soul and me,
beneath the mask that others see"

18:57.971 --> 18:59.473
His chest is still rising.

18:59.598 --> 19:03.101
He's just screwing with me
'cause Cuddy made me baby-sit.

19:03.477 --> 19:06.271
"A pain that tears and bites
and will not bend."

19:06.396 --> 19:08.649
"Only when I sleep
will it end."

19:08.774 --> 19:12.653
Downer.
And medically irrelevant.

19:15.322 --> 19:17.074
You sure
his chest is moving?

19:17.199 --> 19:18.200
House.

19:18.325 --> 19:21.662
If he's faking, you think he's going to
come clean because you said his name?

19:21.787 --> 19:25.958
Back off. Only Thirteen
gets to grab my nipples this time.

19:26.083 --> 19:27.584
You know,
recreating the moment

19:27.709 --> 19:31.672
when you made us crap our pants
isn't actually all that funny.

19:31.797 --> 19:34.800
That is sweet that you're
worried about House.

19:36.844 --> 19:39.054
Unless the next
stanza reads,

19:39.179 --> 19:44.434
"Hoping to fry my brain to death
I smoked some primo crystal math,"

19:44.560 --> 19:45.394
I'm not interested.

19:45.519 --> 19:47.437
You can't deny that
this kid may be suicidal.

19:47.563 --> 19:50.148
We're not here to make him happy,
we're here to diagnose him.

19:50.274 --> 19:51.525
It's an infection.

19:51.650 --> 19:55.237
Swab of the kid's water bottle turned up
toxoplasmosis.

19:55.362 --> 19:57.489
I'll start him
on pyrimethamine.

20:06.623 --> 20:09.084
I had no idea
he felt this way.

20:10.043 --> 20:12.379
Is there a therapist here
that you can recommend?

20:12.504 --> 20:15.132
It might help more
if you talked to him.

20:16.341 --> 20:17.759
He's not ready.

20:17.885 --> 20:20.554
If telling him the truth
would help him stop feeling like this.

20:20.679 --> 20:23.056
If I knew that it'd
make him less confused,

20:23.181 --> 20:24.600
I'd tell him right now.

20:24.725 --> 20:28.103
But if she's wrong,
we'd only make things worse.

20:29.521 --> 20:31.857
He obviously senses
he's different.

20:32.399 --> 20:33.984
He's looking for answers.

20:34.109 --> 20:36.653
Every teenager
feels different.

20:37.779 --> 20:41.700
He's sick. This isn't the time
to spring this on him.

20:45.370 --> 20:46.538
Okay-

20:48.498 --> 20:50.334
When you give Jackson
the antibiotics,

20:50.459 --> 20:53.337
will you please re-start
the testosterone?

20:53.462 --> 20:54.713
Sure.

20:58.550 --> 21:03.055
I get House wanting to jerk me
and Thirteen around, but you guys?

21:03.180 --> 21:05.515
Told you they were
still together.

21:05.641 --> 21:06.516
How'd he know?

21:06.642 --> 21:09.311
He noticed you smell like
Thirteen's soap every morning.

21:09.436 --> 21:12.230
- You figured it out?
- Yes, I'm a little slow.

21:12.356 --> 21:15.776
Maybe someone should let me know
when I should be insulted.

21:15.901 --> 21:17.361
Then House doesn't know.

21:17.486 --> 21:19.154
Probably does now
that you felt her up

21:19.279 --> 21:21.490
during that
last differential.

21:24.034 --> 21:26.244
You noticed this,
but House didn't?

21:26.370 --> 21:29.414
Yes, I get it.
He's generally smarter than me.

21:29.539 --> 21:30.374
Can we please move on?

21:30.499 --> 21:31.667
He's not generally
smarter than you,

21:31.792 --> 21:34.628
he's always
smarter than you.

21:34.753 --> 21:36.046
Unless...

21:36.755 --> 21:39.216
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

21:42.386 --> 21:43.220
Hello?

21:43.345 --> 21:44.388
House is on heroin.

21:46.848 --> 21:50.644
Well, that's certainly
an interesting notion.

21:50.769 --> 21:53.230
It's why his lungs stopped,
it's why he okayed the MRI,

21:53.355 --> 21:56.608
it's why he missed things
he wouldn't ordinarily miss.

21:57.901 --> 22:00.445
We'll run some tests,
and I'll let you know.

22:00.570 --> 22:01.905
FOREMAN: He's there, isn't he?

22:02.030 --> 22:04.408
Well, that would certainly explain
the inappropriate responses.

22:04.533 --> 22:06.743
I got to go. Okay-

22:08.203 --> 22:09.621
Sorry. Consult.

22:11.498 --> 22:12.624
When did you order these?

22:12.749 --> 22:14.251
When you were
in the bathroom.

22:14.376 --> 22:16.962
I thought a celebration
was in order.

22:17.796 --> 22:19.381
To cheating death.

22:27.347 --> 22:29.641
You off bourbon?
Can I get you something else?

22:29.766 --> 22:31.893
I came here
expecting a burger.

22:32.019 --> 22:34.855
Figured I'd have to endure
a little lecture on moderation.

22:34.980 --> 22:36.398
You never listen,
so why...

22:36.523 --> 22:38.483
But instead,
I get a drink.

22:39.317 --> 22:41.611
A nice little serving
of respiratory depressant

22:41.737 --> 22:43.780
on the day that my lungs
stopped working.

22:43.905 --> 22:45.449
You seem fine now.

22:45.574 --> 22:48.285
You don't believe
that I OD'd on Vicodin.

22:48.410 --> 22:50.037
You figure I'm
on something stronger.

22:50.162 --> 22:51.830
And because you can never,
ever assume anything

22:51.955 --> 22:54.124
but the most screwed-up scenario
as far as I'm concerned...

22:54.249 --> 22:55.792
Funny how
I'm usually right.

22:55.917 --> 22:58.128
...you think
that I'm on heroin.

22:59.004 --> 23:02.799
This is your version of a tox screen.
Because if I am on heroin,

23:02.924 --> 23:05.802
I can't drink that without risking
another bout of not breathing.

23:05.927 --> 23:07.721
(SIGHS)

23:10.932 --> 23:12.184
Well?

23:22.861 --> 23:24.362
Good night.

23:30.994 --> 23:32.496
JACKSON: Another shot?

23:32.621 --> 23:34.331
I'm afraid so.

23:35.582 --> 23:37.375
That looks like the vitamins
my parents give me.

23:37.501 --> 23:39.127
Same red top.

23:41.088 --> 23:42.464
(GRUNTS)

23:48.261 --> 23:50.263
These aren't vitamins.

23:52.432 --> 23:53.850
What is it?

23:53.975 --> 23:57.312
I can't tell you that.
You should ask your parents.

23:59.856 --> 24:02.067
(RETCHING)

24:03.401 --> 24:05.028
WILSON: You idiot.

24:09.449 --> 24:11.952
Okay, I admit it.
I have bulimia.

24:13.036 --> 24:14.371
I look good though, don't I?

24:14.496 --> 24:16.540
Heroin. Heroin!

24:16.665 --> 24:19.126
House, of all the stupid...

24:19.251 --> 24:20.460
I'm not on heroin.

24:20.585 --> 24:23.130
I just caught you
with your fingers down your throat.

24:23.255 --> 24:24.840
I'm on methadone.

24:27.634 --> 24:30.345
Stupid product,
heroin without the high.

24:30.470 --> 24:33.265
Yeah, and twice
the risk of death.

24:33.390 --> 24:34.641
But no risk of arrest.

24:34.766 --> 24:36.101
You nearly died.

24:36.226 --> 24:37.936
Today was a fluke,
I nodded off.

24:38.061 --> 24:41.356
Right, you're safe
as long as you never sleep again.

24:41.481 --> 24:44.568
Mis-time your dose, you die,
couple of drinks, you die,

24:44.693 --> 24:46.444
mix it with
the wrong drugs, you die.

24:46.570 --> 24:48.280
You want to detox
from Vicodin,

24:48.405 --> 24:50.282
pick something
that won't kill you.

24:50.407 --> 24:51.992
I'm not detoxing.

24:53.118 --> 24:56.329
If you're looking for something
to help with your pain.

24:56.454 --> 25:00.292
It doesn't help my pain.
It eliminates it.

25:10.635 --> 25:12.971
My leg doesn't hurt anymore.

25:22.147 --> 25:24.357
MELANIE: She completely
disregarded our instructions.

25:24.482 --> 25:26.902
He asked a question.
I was tired of lying.

25:27.027 --> 25:29.321
I didn't tell him anything
about his genetic condition.

25:29.446 --> 25:32.073
I want her removed
from our son's case.

25:33.116 --> 25:35.368
I'm sorry for the position
Dr. Hadley put you in,

25:35.493 --> 25:36.953
but I can't do that.

25:37.078 --> 25:40.624
She's a valuable part
of Dr. House's diagnostic team.

25:40.749 --> 25:42.918
If he stays on the case,
so does she.

25:43.043 --> 25:45.045
We have to deal
with Jackson.

25:45.170 --> 25:47.088
These questions
aren't going to go away.

25:47.214 --> 25:49.007
He's not ready for this.

25:51.092 --> 25:53.053
Let's hope you're wrong.

25:53.970 --> 25:55.347
(SCOFFS)

25:59.893 --> 26:01.937
I'm sorry.
I'll stay away from their son.

26:02.062 --> 26:03.605
No, you won't.

26:03.855 --> 26:06.816
In about 15 minutes, you're the only
person that kid's gonna trust.

26:07.234 --> 26:10.904
If he needs a hand to hold,
make sure yours is available.

26:17.452 --> 26:21.456
So, what,
am I a boy or a girl?

26:22.832 --> 26:27.420
Some of your cells are male,
and some are female.

26:27.545 --> 26:29.422
So, basically,
I'm a freak.

26:29.547 --> 26:31.174
No, no, buddy.

26:32.634 --> 26:34.844
You're just
a little different.

26:37.097 --> 26:42.936
You've known this since I was born
and you never told me?

26:43.061 --> 26:44.938
We didn't want you
to be confused.

26:45.063 --> 26:46.189
So, you lied to me.

26:46.314 --> 26:49.901
Oh, please, sweetie,
we were just trying to protect you.

26:50.026 --> 26:51.069
Don't.

26:52.487 --> 26:54.239
Just leave me alone.

26:56.825 --> 26:57.993
Get out.

27:00.578 --> 27:01.997
Let's go.

27:12.173 --> 27:14.634
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

27:15.635 --> 27:17.095
CUDDY:
You still breathing in there?

27:17.220 --> 27:19.889
Because if not,
I'm sending in janitorial.

27:20.932 --> 27:24.311
I'm not breathing,
but it's strictly voluntary.

27:24.436 --> 27:26.104
You should've seen the guy
who was in here before me.

27:26.229 --> 27:28.231
I know about the methadone.

27:29.190 --> 27:30.233
(SIGHS)

27:30.358 --> 27:32.819
It's legal.
I have a prescription.

27:32.944 --> 27:35.238
Whatever doctor
you conned into writing it

27:35.363 --> 27:37.949
clearly had no idea about
your addiction issues, your lack of...

27:38.074 --> 27:41.745
He knows I'm in pain. What I put
in my body is my business.

27:41.870 --> 27:44.456
If you keep taking this,
you could die.

27:44.581 --> 27:46.916
If he'd said that if
I keep doing this, you could die,

27:47.042 --> 27:48.585
then it'd be your business.

27:50.086 --> 27:53.089
I can't sit by and watch you
kill yourself.

27:53.214 --> 27:56.634
As long as you're in my hospital,
you can't do methadone.

28:04.351 --> 28:06.728
I'll send someone
for my stuff.

28:08.646 --> 28:11.816
That's it?
You're quitting?

28:11.941 --> 28:14.277
You're choosing methadone
over this job?

28:15.111 --> 28:17.822
I'm choosing lack of pain
over this job.

28:22.744 --> 28:23.787
(DOOR CLOSES)

28:27.916 --> 28:30.919
Eventually you have to talk
to your parents again.

28:31.044 --> 28:32.629
No, I don't.

28:43.765 --> 28:48.061
I have this one friend
on my basketball team, Will.

28:48.937 --> 28:52.690
We hang out a lot.
I really like him.

28:52.816 --> 28:55.485
Now I'm worried that I,

28:55.610 --> 28:57.904
you know, like him.

29:01.616 --> 29:03.493
Maybe I'm supposed to.

29:04.619 --> 29:06.788
Because if I'm
really a girl...

29:08.790 --> 29:10.041
(SIGHS)

29:11.292 --> 29:13.169
Do you feel like a girl?

29:14.254 --> 29:17.257
I like dancing
more than basketball.

29:17.382 --> 29:18.716
Is that what that means?

29:25.807 --> 29:26.850
Jackson,

29:28.643 --> 29:33.189
as hard as it is right now,
at least it's out in the open.

29:33.815 --> 29:37.527
You don't have to
hide behind a mask.

29:42.073 --> 29:44.826
I found the poem
you wrote in your room.

29:47.912 --> 29:50.707
No matter
how bad things get,

29:50.832 --> 29:54.043
killing yourself
is never the answer.

30:00.425 --> 30:02.844
This was an
English assignment.

30:04.762 --> 30:06.681
We were supposed
to write a poem

30:06.806 --> 30:08.850
in the style
of Sylvia Plath.

30:13.480 --> 30:15.440
You don't feel this way?

30:17.567 --> 30:19.152
I'm sad sometimes.

30:21.571 --> 30:23.490
But I don't want to die.

30:24.949 --> 30:26.659
At least, I didn't.

30:35.835 --> 30:39.255
Are these antibiotics
supposed to make you nauseous?

30:39.380 --> 30:41.090
Yeah, they can.

30:45.929 --> 30:48.014
(BEEPING)

31:24.217 --> 31:26.261
- We're on our own.
- Is he okay?

31:26.386 --> 31:27.554
He's fine.
He's just not here.

31:27.679 --> 31:29.305
Did he quit?
Did she suspend him?

31:29.430 --> 31:31.224
She didn't say.
Just told me I was in charge

31:31.349 --> 31:32.850
until further notice.

31:32.976 --> 31:34.435
So, if we add
bloody vomit

31:34.561 --> 31:36.020
to our patient's list
of symptoms...

31:36.145 --> 31:38.856
Surgeon reports the bleeding
was caused by a gastric fistula

31:38.982 --> 31:40.316
caused by
necrotizing pancreatitis.

31:40.441 --> 31:41.734
She must have
told you something.

31:41.859 --> 31:43.444
Nothing that would
help us with this patient.

31:43.570 --> 31:45.446
Heart, liver,
kidneys and pancreas.

31:45.572 --> 31:48.449
Obviously, whatever this kid's got,
it's something systemic.

31:48.575 --> 31:49.576
(SIGHS)

31:49.701 --> 31:50.743
Zollinger-Ellison.

31:50.868 --> 31:52.579
Or systemic scleroderma.

31:54.455 --> 31:55.623
Zollinger-Ellison
fits better.

31:56.040 --> 31:56.874
Why?

31:57.000 --> 31:58.126
Can we at least
call House?

31:58.251 --> 32:00.461
We can, I have,
he's not answering.

32:00.587 --> 32:02.463
Put the patient on
proton pump inhibitors.

32:02.589 --> 32:04.007
If he gets better,
it's Zollinger-Ellison.

32:04.132 --> 32:06.509
If not, it's scleroderma.

32:11.514 --> 32:14.392
Zollinger-Ellison
doesn't fit better.

32:15.268 --> 32:16.853
You don't want it
to be scleroderma

32:16.978 --> 32:18.646
because that means
he's going to die.

32:18.771 --> 32:19.856
Patients die all the time.

32:19.981 --> 32:22.984
Not the ones whose
families you've ruined.

32:23.109 --> 32:25.445
I don't think that, you do.

32:26.362 --> 32:27.697
It's not your fault.

32:27.822 --> 32:29.866
He was no more confused
than any other teenager,

32:29.991 --> 32:32.827
then I started a fire
and threw gas on it.

32:32.952 --> 32:34.245

32:44.255 --> 32:45.590

32:45.715 --> 32:48.259
I'll be back
around 10:00 tonight.

32:49.260 --> 32:50.470
Go on in.

32:50.595 --> 32:51.679
Okay-

32:56.601 --> 32:57.435
Who is she?

32:57.560 --> 32:59.354
HOUSE: I hired her
to watch me sleep,

32:59.479 --> 33:00.730
make sure I don't
stop breathing.

33:00.855 --> 33:03.691
Home nurses
usually wear scrubs.

33:03.816 --> 33:05.360
She's not a nurse.

33:06.569 --> 33:10.323
You hired a hooker to watch you sleep?
That just can't...

33:13.034 --> 33:15.203
Surprisingly,
hookers are cheaper.

33:15.328 --> 33:18.539
They don't sue for sexual harassment.
Which one?

33:19.540 --> 33:21.000
You shaved!

33:22.210 --> 33:24.170
The red one then.

33:24.295 --> 33:26.381
You have two ties?

Meeting at
St. Sebastian's today.

33:28.549 --> 33:29.926
I'm going to try
and talk them into

33:30.051 --> 33:31.803
starting up
a diagnostics department.

33:31.928 --> 33:33.471
That sounds great.

33:34.430 --> 33:38.226
I just came by to check up on you,
see how you were doing.

33:39.769 --> 33:41.187
I'm fine.

33:42.980 --> 33:44.232
I guess you are.

33:46.984 --> 33:49.487
He hasn't responded
to the medication at all?

33:49.612 --> 33:51.280
I'm afraid not.

33:51.864 --> 33:55.201
So, that means
he's got the other thing?

33:55.326 --> 33:59.122
I'm so sorry. We'll start him
on anti-inflammatories.

33:59.247 --> 34:02.542
If we're lucky,
that will slow down the progression.

34:11.259 --> 34:13.302
My son has
a death sentence,

34:13.428 --> 34:16.222
and I can't go in there and be with him
because of you.

34:16.347 --> 34:17.348
I'm sorry.

34:17.473 --> 34:20.268
You find a homework assignment
and decide he's suicidal,

34:20.393 --> 34:22.729
make it your own
personal mission.

34:22.854 --> 34:23.896
I let my feelings...

34:24.021 --> 34:26.315
Oh, don't you
dare apologize.

34:26.441 --> 34:28.025
Like it could absolve you

34:28.151 --> 34:30.570
of what you've done
to me, my family.

34:30.695 --> 34:32.280
He was fine.

34:32.405 --> 34:34.490
CUDDY: I understand
why you're angry.

34:34.615 --> 34:36.576
But this isn't where
you belong right now.

34:36.701 --> 34:38.119
He won't let us
in the room.

34:38.244 --> 34:40.830
He's a teenager,
you're his mother.

34:40.955 --> 34:43.207
This is not the time
to start listening to him.

34:44.333 --> 34:45.752
Go be with him.

34:54.510 --> 34:55.970
Thank you.

34:58.431 --> 35:00.516
I didn't do it for you.

35:06.147 --> 35:07.398
We made a mistake.

35:07.523 --> 35:08.483
No, we didn't.

35:08.608 --> 35:09.942
The methadone
is good for him.

35:10.067 --> 35:12.153
The methadone
is gonna kill him.

35:12.278 --> 35:14.489
He shaved.
He was wearing a tie.

35:14.614 --> 35:16.407
He has a meeting
at St. Sebastian.

35:16.532 --> 35:17.867
If he buys
a new pair of shoes,

35:17.992 --> 35:19.410
should we let him
smoke crack?

35:19.535 --> 35:21.370
Cuddy, he's happy-

35:21.496 --> 35:24.916
House doesn't do happy,
pain or no pain.

35:25.500 --> 35:27.043
Okay, maybe.

35:27.543 --> 35:29.837
But he's our friend,

35:29.962 --> 35:35.301
and this is his one chance
to not be miserable.

35:59.116 --> 36:01.285
The heels, very nice.

36:01.953 --> 36:04.789
No reason not to wear them
now that House is gone.

36:04.914 --> 36:06.040
You Okay?

36:06.165 --> 36:08.209
Yeah. Just tired.

36:08.334 --> 36:09.794
Got some good news.

36:09.919 --> 36:10.795
The patient's scleroderma

36:10.920 --> 36:12.797
is responding to
the anti-inflammatory meds.

36:12.922 --> 36:15.341
His AST level
has dropped a bit.

36:15.466 --> 36:17.802
So, he's dying
slightly less quickly than we thought.

36:17.927 --> 36:19.971
That's great news.

36:22.181 --> 36:23.808
I'm not okay.

36:30.106 --> 36:31.816
What's his AST?

36:32.817 --> 36:34.151
185, I think.

36:34.277 --> 36:35.111
That's a pretty fast drop.

36:35.236 --> 36:37.029
Are we sure it's from
the anti-inflammatories?

36:37.154 --> 36:38.114
What else could it be from?

36:38.239 --> 36:39.740
He's been off the antibiotics
for a while.

36:39.866 --> 36:40.908
Proton pump inhibitors
wouldn't...

36:41.033 --> 36:42.076
He's back on testosterone.

36:42.201 --> 36:43.703
Testosterone wouldn't help
his liver function.

36:43.828 --> 36:45.246
But it could improve
his kidney function,

36:45.371 --> 36:47.540
which would also
lower his AST.

36:47.665 --> 36:49.500
But not in kidneys damaged
by scleroderma.

36:49.625 --> 36:52.086
Which means
it's not scleroderma.

36:57.049 --> 36:59.635

in two hours.

Sorry, I haven't done it yet.

37:08.102 --> 37:09.729
You have no right
to sabotage...

37:09.854 --> 37:11.647
I was busy with this.

37:13.774 --> 37:16.527
It's a list of requirements
for your methadone treatment.

37:16.819 --> 37:20.948
Weekly drug tests, supervised doses
administered on a precise schedule,

37:21.073 --> 37:23.618
by me or one of the nurses.

37:24.160 --> 37:25.870
Seems weird,
getting my meds here,

37:25.995 --> 37:27.496
when I'm working
somewhere else.

37:27.622 --> 37:28.789
Yes.

37:30.958 --> 37:33.210
I'm offering you
your job back.

37:36.339 --> 37:38.215
- I want a raise.
- No.

37:38.466 --> 37:41.677
And a bigger office,
but in the same spot.

37:41.802 --> 37:43.095
No.

37:44.388 --> 37:47.224
We both know
this is where you belong.

37:51.145 --> 37:52.104
Okay-

37:54.607 --> 37:56.233
Welcome back.

38:03.449 --> 38:04.951
Thank you.

38:06.661 --> 38:08.079
You're welcome.

(SIGHS)

38:16.796 --> 38:17.880
You Okay?

38:18.589 --> 38:21.092
I have issues
with authority. You?

38:21.217 --> 38:22.927
We thought
you were gone.

38:23.052 --> 38:24.136
Cuddy missed me.

38:24.261 --> 38:26.013
And what happened
to your cane?

38:26.138 --> 38:28.599
She asked to borrow it
for some reason.

38:28.724 --> 38:31.477
Patient dead,
or do I need to do anything?

38:31.602 --> 38:32.728
He's got scleroderma.

38:32.853 --> 38:34.563
It's not scleroderma.

38:34.689 --> 38:39.735
Wow, two days and you've
already got two separate theories.

38:39.860 --> 38:42.113
You're back. Good.

38:42.238 --> 38:44.907
We noticed a drop in AST levels.
It's not from the anti-inflammatory.

38:45.032 --> 38:46.909
It's because his kidneys
got better from the testosterone.

38:47.034 --> 38:48.953
Which rules out scleroderma.

38:49.495 --> 38:51.080
When did you two
come up with this?

38:51.205 --> 38:54.041
We ran into each other
in the lobby.

38:55.918 --> 38:57.420
So, what did we miss?

38:57.545 --> 38:59.714
When I say "we," I mean you,
since I wasn't here.

38:59.839 --> 39:01.716
We've ruled out
Zollinger-Ellison.

39:01.841 --> 39:03.009
That was a dumb idea.

39:03.134 --> 39:04.927
- Why?
- Because it was wrong.

39:05.052 --> 39:09.932
Also Toxoplasmosis, dehydration,
SLE, various intersex disorders.

39:10.057 --> 39:11.183
Oh, crap.

39:14.270 --> 39:16.022
Does this kid like
energy drinks?

39:16.147 --> 39:19.150
I saw some empty bottles
in the team's locker room.

39:19.275 --> 39:21.736
But energy drinks
don't explain...

39:21.861 --> 39:22.862
Nice work.

39:22.987 --> 39:24.697
So, we're okay?

39:26.032 --> 39:27.658
Why wouldn't we be?

39:28.534 --> 39:30.161
Nice heels.

39:38.210 --> 39:39.754
This is all
your parents' fault.

39:40.171 --> 39:41.088
Excuse me?

39:41.213 --> 39:45.051
You chug a lot of energy drinks before,
during and after practice?

39:45.843 --> 39:48.095
Your son came in here
with simple dehydration.

39:48.220 --> 39:50.139
That's why he collapsed
during the game.

39:50.264 --> 39:53.434
The ER treated him for that.
It didn't help the pain.

39:53.559 --> 39:55.311
That's where
the energy drinks came in.

39:55.436 --> 39:56.604
They put a strain
on his kidneys,

39:56.729 --> 39:59.732
so he needed more time to rebound
from the initial dehydration.

39:59.857 --> 40:00.983
Then why isn't he better?

40:01.108 --> 40:03.736
That's where
your idiocy came in.

40:03.861 --> 40:05.738
Before we could give him
another glass of water,

40:05.863 --> 40:08.115
you two insisted I do an MRI.

40:08.240 --> 40:12.536
So, I go down a blind alley,
looking for a blind uterus,

40:12.661 --> 40:14.872
and my team injects him
with contrast material.

40:15.664 --> 40:17.166
If his kidneys
had been healthy,

40:17.291 --> 40:19.585
he would've filtered out the contrast
in a couple of hours.

40:19.710 --> 40:22.171
Since they weren't,
it went around and around,

40:22.296 --> 40:24.924
eventually getting absorbed by his
heart, his liver and his pancreas,

40:25.049 --> 40:27.093
getting in trouble
everywhere it went.

40:27.718 --> 40:30.137
Your son was fine
when he got here.

40:30.262 --> 40:33.057
It was
your freaked-out over-protectiveness

40:33.182 --> 40:34.600
that nearly killed him.

40:34.725 --> 40:36.018
Nearly?

40:36.977 --> 40:41.565
He's young. A few weeks of dialysis,
he should be fine.

40:43.109 --> 40:44.485
(SIGHS)

40:49.365 --> 40:52.660
You gave birth
to a freak of nature,

40:52.785 --> 40:56.163
doesn't mean it's a good idea
to treat him like one.

41:08.425 --> 41:09.677
How are you feeling?

41:09.802 --> 41:11.220
A little bit better.

41:11.929 --> 41:14.640
I saw you talking
to your parents earlier, that's good.

41:14.932 --> 41:17.184
My mom asked
if I wanted to take dance lessons.

41:17.309 --> 41:18.894
That's great.

41:19.937 --> 41:22.523
I'm actually worried
I might miss basketball.

41:22.648 --> 41:24.066
I was starting to get good.

41:24.358 --> 41:26.110
No reason you can't do both.

41:47.089 --> 41:50.593
Starting tomorrow, you'll come
to my office for your fix.

41:50.718 --> 41:53.012
I'm done with
the methadone.

41:54.054 --> 41:55.598
I screwed up.

41:55.723 --> 41:58.100
The kid's parents
wanted that MRI.

41:58.225 --> 42:01.270
I knew he didn't need it.
I did it anyway.

42:01.395 --> 42:02.688
That's what got him sick.

42:03.856 --> 42:06.025
You just solved a case
that no one else could solve.

42:06.358 --> 42:08.235
I created a case.

42:08.360 --> 42:13.574
I played nice because I was in a
good mood because it didn't hurt.

42:13.699 --> 42:15.993
You don't need your pain
to be a good doctor.

42:16.118 --> 42:17.119
I'm not interested in good.

42:17.244 --> 42:19.121
You're afraid to be happy.

42:19.246 --> 42:21.332
Why do you care if I'm happy?

42:29.256 --> 42:33.135
You're afraid of change. The one thing
you have is your intellect.

42:33.260 --> 42:36.222
You think if that's compromised,
you have nothing.

42:40.935 --> 42:42.269
Just take it.

42:43.062 --> 42:44.563
No.

42:44.980 --> 42:46.398
Don't do this.

42:47.983 --> 42:49.652
It's already done.

42:53.739 --> 42:55.908
This is the only me you get.
