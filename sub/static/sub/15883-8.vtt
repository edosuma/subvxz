00:04.830 --> 00:06.890
Okay, this is it.
Any questions?

00:11.620 --> 00:14.130
Everybody knows

00:14.500 --> 00:16.640
'cause we got one shot
at this.

00:17.630 --> 00:20.540
There's no dumb questions,

Whoo! Hello!

01:17.430 --> 01:19.630
♪ Hello ♪

01:23.000 --> 01:25.400
Thanks for coming out.
I'm Keegan-Michael Key.

01:25.530 --> 01:27.190
- I'm Jordan Peele.
- And we are Key and Peele.

01:27.270 --> 01:28.970
Welcome.
(cheers and applause)

01:29.060 --> 01:30.760
Thank you so much.

01:32.960 --> 01:34.300
So...

01:34.340 --> 01:36.500
- Sometimes I get the giggles.
- You get the giggles?

01:36.540 --> 01:37.880
I get the giggles
when we're doing this.

01:37.880 --> 01:39.540
Brother, you were
born with the giggles, man.

01:39.580 --> 01:40.610
I came out of the womb...

01:40.660 --> 01:42.160
(giggles)
giggling.

01:42.580 --> 01:44.790
- Giggling.
- It's hilarious in there!

01:46.190 --> 01:48.300
The best laughter
and the hardest to not laugh

01:48.330 --> 01:49.530
is when you're
not supposed to laugh.

01:49.560 --> 01:50.860
Right, exactly.
That's like...

01:50.880 --> 01:53.270
And you guys be just laughing
just in church for no reason.

01:53.290 --> 01:54.690
Church is a deathtrap.
(laughs)

01:56.160 --> 01:58.290
Or the worst is when
you're getting the giggles...

01:58.320 --> 02:00.800
And the wor... is when the priest
or the minister says this...

02:00.830 --> 02:03.370
"Because the Lord
is inside of you."

02:03.410 --> 02:05.320
(giggling)

02:05.340 --> 02:06.820
He'll go,
"why are you laughing?"

02:06.850 --> 02:08.669
- Don't laugh. Yeah.
- I'm sorry.

02:08.710 --> 02:09.660
It's wor... it's the worst.

02:09.690 --> 02:12.390
Are you... are you the type
of guy who... you cry at a movie?

02:12.410 --> 02:15.080
- I cry buckets at movies.
- At like...

02:15.130 --> 02:16.630
- At comedies I cry.
- No, no...

02:16.650 --> 02:18.340
'cause I... (sobs)
"I could've got that job."

02:18.360 --> 02:20.160
So, your wife...
(laughter)

02:20.700 --> 02:23.380
So, you just cry out in the open
if you're sitting next to your wife.

02:23.470 --> 02:26.900
Oh yeah... If I'm... if I... if a tear
is about to come down my face,

02:26.930 --> 02:27.990
I'm at a sad movie,

02:28.310 --> 02:30.670
I'll just be using gravity
on this mother-[bleep] to spill it out.

02:30.690 --> 02:32.110
(laughs)

02:33.590 --> 02:35.590
What? Sir, are you having
a hard time hearing the film?

02:35.610 --> 02:37.570
No, I-I was looking 'cause
you got a beautiful ceiling.

02:37.620 --> 02:39.140
- Oh, thank you very much.
- Craftsmanship up there.

02:39.160 --> 02:40.330
I appreciate it,
yeah, yeah.

02:40.370 --> 02:41.710
I'm sorry, baby,
hold on a second, baby,

02:41.750 --> 02:43.190
Hold on a second, baby,
I'm just looking at the ceiling.

02:44.180 --> 02:46.510
Carvell thanks you for coming.

02:47.290 --> 02:49.850
(sighs) First order of business,
I'm sure you all heard

02:50.000 --> 02:52.460
that Twigs got pulled
out the river this morning.

02:52.470 --> 02:54.100
It ain't no secret

02:54.200 --> 02:56.740
that he and Carvell
grew up in the hood together.

02:56.770 --> 02:58.800
So listen up.

02:58.910 --> 03:01.750
'cause Carvell
about to say some words.

03:01.940 --> 03:04.180
(panting)

03:09.790 --> 03:11.520
Okay, you know what?

03:11.660 --> 03:14.080
Don't none of you
look at them tears

03:14.180 --> 03:15.870
and think that [bleep]
is funny.

03:16.010 --> 03:20.180
Because it takes a big [bleep]
man to cry in front of his crew.

03:22.480 --> 03:24.640
Go ahead, Carvell.
(sniffles)

03:27.100 --> 03:29.840
Y'all know Twigs was my boy.

03:31.670 --> 03:34.370
Back in the day,

03:34.760 --> 03:37.660
we used to pretend
the sofa cushions was a fort.

03:37.980 --> 03:40.750
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
(takes breath)

03:41.080 --> 03:43.650
And we used to pretend
that the floor was molten lava.

03:43.720 --> 03:44.780
Oh...

03:44.850 --> 03:46.420
(panting)

03:46.880 --> 03:49.140
Okay, you know what,
though?

03:49.820 --> 03:53.190
There ain't nothing funny
'bout that.

03:53.260 --> 03:55.130
Of course this man is crying.

03:55.190 --> 03:59.660
'cause he and Twigs
was kids together. Okay?

03:59.730 --> 04:00.970
You know what I mean?

04:01.030 --> 04:02.770
They was best friends
forever and [bleep].

04:02.840 --> 04:06.770
(sniffles)
Go ahead, Carvell.

04:07.200 --> 04:09.930
We used to play <i>Care Bears</i>.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.800
Mmm-hmm.
Hmm-hmm.

04:14.230 --> 04:18.110
Twigs and I would spend
the good part of an afternoon

04:18.170 --> 04:22.089
trying to figure out
which C-C-Care Bear we was.

04:22.240 --> 04:25.070
Oh, oh...
(chuckling)

04:26.160 --> 04:27.460
Oh...

04:27.490 --> 04:29.890
I wish one of y'all
mother-[bleep]

04:29.990 --> 04:31.570
would just start laughing,

04:31.630 --> 04:34.910
'cause you all know
you think this [bleep] is funny.

04:34.980 --> 04:38.940
Carvell over here, blubbering
and talking 'bout <i>Care Bears</i>.

04:39.050 --> 04:41.680
But you know what?

04:44.560 --> 04:46.290
But you...

04:46.320 --> 04:50.030
(holding back sobs)
(wheezes)

04:51.680 --> 04:54.890
Those are manly tears!
Okay?

04:55.170 --> 04:57.810
Those some manly-ass tears

04:57.870 --> 04:59.690
right there that you lookin' at!

05:00.530 --> 05:02.490
Go ahead, Carvell.

05:04.130 --> 05:05.430
And then...

05:05.500 --> 05:09.100
And then... and then...
and then... and... and... and...

05:09.400 --> 05:11.720
(blubbering)
(laughs)

05:11.750 --> 05:12.830
Mm, I'm sorry, man.

05:12.850 --> 05:14.960
That was a weird-ass sneeze
I just did right there.

05:14.970 --> 05:15.660
God damn it.

05:15.690 --> 05:18.380
Can a brother get some [bleep]
claritin up in here?

05:23.630 --> 05:25.200
Go ahead, Carvell.

05:25.950 --> 05:29.490
Twigs always
fancied himself Share Bear.

05:29.530 --> 05:31.480
Mm...
(groaning laugh)

05:33.880 --> 05:34.810
I always...

05:34.970 --> 05:37.510
I always thought...
thought of myself

05:37.710 --> 05:39.600
thought of myself
as more of a Funshine Bear.

05:39.670 --> 05:40.790
Mm... okay.

05:40.830 --> 05:44.620
Okay, all you [bleep] need
to respect that right there!

05:44.670 --> 05:47.710
Okay? Y'all need to listen
to Funshi...

05:47.770 --> 05:50.140
(laughs)

05:52.340 --> 05:53.870
(howling laughter)

05:55.800 --> 05:57.980
I'm so... I'm sorry, man.

05:58.020 --> 06:00.390
You a Funshine Bear, man.
I'm sorry, that...

06:00.870 --> 06:03.500
That is some funny [bleep].
(laughs)

06:05.410 --> 06:07.840
(gunshot)
Whoa, whoa.

06:08.880 --> 06:10.620
(heaves)

06:11.460 --> 06:13.460
All right.
Let's go sell some crack.

06:19.570 --> 06:21.310
Jahari, my friend.

06:21.530 --> 06:23.680
There are a lot of beautiful
women out here today.

06:23.680 --> 06:24.760
(chuckles)
Yeah.

06:24.780 --> 06:27.180
Karim, my friend,
you speak the truth.

06:27.310 --> 06:29.750
Well, I do what I can.

06:29.810 --> 06:31.380
- Ooh.
- Oh...

06:31.380 --> 06:32.270
- Wow.
- Right?

06:32.270 --> 06:33.870
- Ha-ha.
- Blip.

06:33.870 --> 06:35.570
Sha-bloimps.
(laughs)

06:35.580 --> 06:38.020
You know, I caught a little
glimpse of her foot nut.

06:38.440 --> 06:40.350
(clicks tongue)
You saw ankle bone?

06:40.350 --> 06:41.160
Well...

06:41.210 --> 06:43.340
Got some ankle cleavage,
you dirty devil, huh?

06:43.390 --> 06:44.960
- You saw?
- God, I saw.

06:44.990 --> 06:46.860
(both talking over each other)

06:50.570 --> 06:51.500
Very good, very good...

06:57.010 --> 06:58.710
Mm.

06:59.260 --> 07:01.060
- Hmm-hmm.
- Oh...

07:01.130 --> 07:02.830
Dude, did you see
the bridge on that nose?

07:03.050 --> 07:05.120
I mean, if it is
any indication...

07:05.160 --> 07:07.830
- Wow.
- Hhh-holy garbanzo beans.

07:07.840 --> 07:10.630
I'll tell you what.
That is a bridge I'd like to cross.

07:10.680 --> 07:13.210
(both laugh)

07:13.660 --> 07:15.960
This is my boy.
This is my boy.

07:15.960 --> 07:18.400
(laughing)
This is my boy.

07:19.470 --> 07:20.840
Oh.

07:25.300 --> 07:26.640
Hmm.

07:28.760 --> 07:30.890
- Not a lot to go on there.
- Not really. Not really.

07:31.240 --> 07:32.310
- Good height.
- Good height.

07:32.350 --> 07:33.570
- Good height.
- Crazy tall.

07:33.580 --> 07:36.210
(growls)
Yeah, like 5'9".

07:36.410 --> 07:38.120
Heh...

07:38.680 --> 07:41.550
Come on. Come on. Come on.
(muttering)

07:42.230 --> 07:44.740
Come on. She's tall.
She's tall. She's tall.

07:44.770 --> 07:46.840
That's right. She's tall.
There's nothing to be done.

07:46.880 --> 07:48.280
Getting wet. Let me see...

07:48.380 --> 07:51.010
Let me see it from behind.
Let me see it from behind.

07:51.180 --> 07:52.980
That's how you hit it.
That's how you hit it.

07:52.980 --> 07:54.960
Jahari, can I tell you something
in confidence right now?

07:55.060 --> 07:56.480
Okay.

07:56.510 --> 07:57.370
(whispers)
I'm a virgin.

07:58.550 --> 08:00.620
(soul music)

08:01.580 --> 08:04.050
I went down to Georgia
a couple years ago,

08:04.140 --> 08:05.940
and I was just... oh...
(laughs)

08:06.080 --> 08:07.250
It's not funny, it's just...
(laughter)

08:07.290 --> 08:09.960
- That's...
- just... just a fact.

08:10.010 --> 08:12.310
It's just what happened.

08:12.370 --> 08:13.670
Trying to get
to the funny part.

08:13.700 --> 08:14.960
She's...
(laughs)

08:15.100 --> 08:17.230
White people come up to you.
"Hey.

08:18.040 --> 08:21.930
"So, you like Darius, huh?
You like Darius?"

08:22.310 --> 08:24.200
"What the [bleep]? Darius?
What are you talking to me..."

08:24.220 --> 08:26.350
- "You like Darius?"
- Darius Rucker?

08:26.400 --> 08:27.770
"Hootie, man. Hootie.

08:27.780 --> 08:28.820
Hootie, man.
Don't you love Hootie?

08:28.840 --> 08:30.000
He's huge down there.

08:30.070 --> 08:31.830
He's enormous.
As a country star.

08:31.850 --> 08:33.020
Darius Rucker.
Huge down there.

08:33.059 --> 08:34.850
There's only like three ever.
Charley Pride,

08:35.299 --> 08:36.450
Darius Rucker...

08:37.640 --> 08:38.809
There's only two.

08:38.809 --> 08:39.980

Hootie & the Blowfish.

09:40.600 --> 09:42.280

The whole band was just called
Hootie & the Blowfish. That's it.

10:01.640 --> 10:03.330
It was a nonsense name.

Yeah, but you said
you weren't Hootie.

10:54.050 --> 10:55.820
No, I'm not, sir.

10:55.840 --> 10:58.390
But in the question
you just asked the audience,

10:58.410 --> 10:59.640
I-I was clearly Hootie.

10:59.820 --> 11:01.760
- So you are Hootie!

But that might as well say,
"No nonsense,"

that always cracks me up.

You know, they bust
a whole bunch of cocaine.

13:18.780 --> 13:19.849

- And I lo...

13:19.850 --> 13:21.806
