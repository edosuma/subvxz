(dramatic music)

00:04.830 --> 00:06.890
Okay, this is it.
Any questions?

00:11.620 --> 00:14.130
Everybody knows
what they're doing, right?

00:14.500 --> 00:16.640
'cause we got one shot
at this.

00:17.630 --> 00:20.540
There's no dumb questions,
you guys.

00:22.820 --> 00:24.790
Did you have a question?
No?

00:24.850 --> 00:28.360
So all you guys know
exactly what your job is.

00:29.780 --> 00:32.110
Okay, so, on my count.

00:33.000 --> 00:35.840
Three, two, one.

00:36.870 --> 00:39.600
Go, go, go, go!

00:39.670 --> 00:41.610
Whoa!
(giggling)

00:41.650 --> 00:43.940
(making strange sounds)

00:45.220 --> 00:47.720
(grunting)

00:47.810 --> 00:48.920
Yah!

00:49.460 --> 00:50.530
Unbelievable.

01:13.590 --> 01:17.000
Whoo! Hello!

01:17.430 --> 01:19.630
â™ª Hello â™ª

01:23.000 --> 01:25.400
Thanks for coming out.
I'm Keegan-Michael Key.

01:25.530 --> 01:27.190
- I'm Jordan Peele.
- And we are Key and Peele.

01:27.270 --> 01:28.970
Welcome.
(cheers and applause)

01:29.060 --> 01:30.760
Thank you so much.

01:32.960 --> 01:34.300
So...

01:34.340 --> 01:36.500
- Sometimes I get the giggles.
- You get the giggles?

01:36.540 --> 01:37.880
I get the giggles
when we're doing this.

01:37.880 --> 01:39.540
Brother, you were
born with the giggles, man.

01:39.580 --> 01:40.610
I came out of the womb...

01:40.660 --> 01:42.160
(giggles)
giggling.

01:42.580 --> 01:44.790
- Giggling.
- It's hilarious in there!

01:46.190 --> 01:48.300
The best laughter
and the hardest to not laugh

01:48.330 --> 01:49.530
is when you're
not supposed to laugh.

01:49.560 --> 01:50.860
Right, exactly.
That's like...

01:50.880 --> 01:53.270
And you guys be just laughing
just in church for no reason.

01:53.290 --> 01:54.690
Church is a deathtrap.
(laughs)

01:56.160 --> 01:58.290
Or the worst is when
you're getting the giggles...

01:58.320 --> 02:00.800
And the wor... is when the priest
or the minister says this...

02:00.830 --> 02:03.370
"Because the Lord
is inside of you."

02:03.410 --> 02:05.320
(giggling)

02:05.340 --> 02:06.820
He'll go,
"why are you laughing?"

02:06.850 --> 02:08.669
- Don't laugh. Yeah.
- I'm sorry.

02:08.710 --> 02:09.660
It's wor... it's the worst.

02:09.690 --> 02:12.390
Are you... are you the type
of guy who... you cry at a movie?

02:12.410 --> 02:15.080
- I cry buckets at movies.
- At like...

02:15.130 --> 02:16.630
- At comedies I cry.
- No, no...

02:16.650 --> 02:18.340
'cause I... (sobs)
"I could've got that job."

02:18.360 --> 02:20.160
So, your wife...
(laughter)

02:20.700 --> 02:23.380
So, you just cry out in the open
if you're sitting next to your wife.

02:23.470 --> 02:26.900
Oh yeah... If I'm... if I... if a tear
is about to come down my face,

02:26.930 --> 02:27.990
I'm at a sad movie,

02:28.310 --> 02:30.670
I'll just be using gravity
on this mother-[bleep] to spill it out.

02:30.690 --> 02:32.110
(laughs)

02:33.590 --> 02:35.590
What? Sir, are you having
a hard time hearing the film?

02:35.610 --> 02:37.570
No, I-I was looking 'cause
you got a beautiful ceiling.

02:37.620 --> 02:39.140
- Oh, thank you very much.
- Craftsmanship up there.

02:39.160 --> 02:40.330
I appreciate it,
yeah, yeah.

02:40.370 --> 02:41.710
I'm sorry, baby,
hold on a second, baby,

02:41.750 --> 02:43.190
Hold on a second, baby,
I'm just looking at the ceiling.

02:44.180 --> 02:46.510
Carvell thanks you for coming.

02:47.290 --> 02:49.850
(sighs) First order of business,
I'm sure you all heard

02:50.000 --> 02:52.460
that Twigs got pulled
out the river this morning.

02:52.470 --> 02:54.100
It ain't no secret

02:54.200 --> 02:56.740
that he and Carvell
grew up in the hood together.

02:56.770 --> 02:58.800
So listen up.

02:58.910 --> 03:01.750
'cause Carvell
about to say some words.

03:01.940 --> 03:04.180
(panting)

03:09.790 --> 03:11.520
Okay, you know what?

03:11.660 --> 03:14.080
Don't none of you
look at them tears

03:14.180 --> 03:15.870
and think that [bleep]
is funny.

03:16.010 --> 03:20.180
Because it takes a big [bleep]
man to cry in front of his crew.

03:22.480 --> 03:24.640
Go ahead, Carvell.
(sniffles)

03:27.100 --> 03:29.840
Y'all know Twigs was my boy.

03:31.670 --> 03:34.370
Back in the day,

03:34.760 --> 03:37.660
we used to pretend
the sofa cushions was a fort.

03:37.980 --> 03:40.750
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
(takes breath)

03:41.080 --> 03:43.650
And we used to pretend
that the floor was molten lava.

03:43.720 --> 03:44.780
Oh...

03:44.850 --> 03:46.420
(panting)

03:46.880 --> 03:49.140
Okay, you know what,
though?

03:49.820 --> 03:53.190
There ain't nothing funny
'bout that.

03:53.260 --> 03:55.130
Of course this man is crying.

03:55.190 --> 03:59.660
'cause he and Twigs
was kids together. Okay?

03:59.730 --> 04:00.970
You know what I mean?

04:01.030 --> 04:02.770
They was best friends
forever and [bleep].

04:02.840 --> 04:06.770
(sniffles)
Go ahead, Carvell.

04:07.200 --> 04:09.930
We used to play <i>Care Bears</i>.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.800
Mmm-hmm.
Hmm-hmm.

04:14.230 --> 04:18.110
Twigs and I would spend
the good part of an afternoon

04:18.170 --> 04:22.089
trying to figure out
which C-C-Care Bear we was.

04:22.240 --> 04:25.070
Oh, oh...
(chuckling)

04:26.160 --> 04:27.460
Oh...

04:27.490 --> 04:29.890
I wish one of y'all
mother-[bleep]

04:29.990 --> 04:31.570
would just start laughing,

04:31.630 --> 04:34.910
'cause you all know
you think this [bleep] is funny.

04:34.980 --> 04:38.940
Carvell over here, blubbering
and talking 'bout <i>Care Bears</i>.

04:39.050 --> 04:41.680
But you know what?

04:44.560 --> 04:46.290
But you...

04:46.320 --> 04:50.030
(holding back sobs)
(wheezes)

04:51.680 --> 04:54.890
Those are manly tears!
Okay?

04:55.170 --> 04:57.810
Those some manly-ass tears

04:57.870 --> 04:59.690
right there that you lookin' at!

05:00.530 --> 05:02.490
Go ahead, Carvell.

05:04.130 --> 05:05.430
And then...

05:05.500 --> 05:09.100
And then... and then...
and then... and... and... and...

05:09.400 --> 05:11.720
(blubbering)
(laughs)

05:11.750 --> 05:12.830
Mm, I'm sorry, man.

05:12.850 --> 05:14.960
That was a weird-ass sneeze
I just did right there.

05:14.970 --> 05:15.660
God damn it.

05:15.690 --> 05:18.380
Can a brother get some [bleep]
claritin up in here?

05:23.630 --> 05:25.200
Go ahead, Carvell.

05:25.950 --> 05:29.490
Twigs always
fancied himself Share Bear.

05:29.530 --> 05:31.480
Mm...
(groaning laugh)

05:33.880 --> 05:34.810
I always...

05:34.970 --> 05:37.510
I always thought...
thought of myself

05:37.710 --> 05:39.600
thought of myself
as more of a Funshine Bear.

05:39.670 --> 05:40.790
Mm... okay.

05:40.830 --> 05:44.620
Okay, all you [bleep] need
to respect that right there!

05:44.670 --> 05:47.710
Okay? Y'all need to listen
to Funshi...

05:47.770 --> 05:50.140
(laughs)

05:52.340 --> 05:53.870
(howling laughter)

05:55.800 --> 05:57.980
I'm so... I'm sorry, man.

05:58.020 --> 06:00.390
You a Funshine Bear, man.
I'm sorry, that...

06:00.870 --> 06:03.500
That is some funny [bleep].
(laughs)

06:05.410 --> 06:07.840
(gunshot)
Whoa, whoa.

06:08.880 --> 06:10.620
(heaves)

06:11.460 --> 06:13.460
All right.
Let's go sell some crack.

06:19.570 --> 06:21.310
Jahari, my friend.

06:21.530 --> 06:23.680
There are a lot of beautiful
women out here today.

06:23.680 --> 06:24.760
(chuckles)
Yeah.

06:24.780 --> 06:27.180
Karim, my friend,
you speak the truth.

06:27.310 --> 06:29.750
Well, I do what I can.

06:29.810 --> 06:31.380
- Ooh.
- Oh...

06:31.380 --> 06:32.270
- Wow.
- Right?

06:32.270 --> 06:33.870
- Ha-ha.
- Blip.

06:33.870 --> 06:35.570
Sha-bloimps.
(laughs)

06:35.580 --> 06:38.020
You know, I caught a little
glimpse of her foot nut.

06:38.440 --> 06:40.350
(clicks tongue)
You saw ankle bone?

06:40.350 --> 06:41.160
Well...

06:41.210 --> 06:43.340
Got some ankle cleavage,
you dirty devil, huh?

06:43.390 --> 06:44.960
- You saw?
- God, I saw.

06:44.990 --> 06:46.860
(both talking over each other)

06:50.570 --> 06:51.500
Very good, very good...

06:57.010 --> 06:58.710
Mm.

06:59.260 --> 07:01.060
- Hmm-hmm.
- Oh...

07:01.130 --> 07:02.830
Dude, did you see
the bridge on that nose?

07:03.050 --> 07:05.120
I mean, if it is
any indication...

07:05.160 --> 07:07.830
- Wow.
- Hhh-holy garbanzo beans.

07:07.840 --> 07:10.630
I'll tell you what.
That is a bridge I'd like to cross.

07:10.680 --> 07:13.210
(both laugh)

07:13.660 --> 07:15.960
This is my boy.
This is my boy.

07:15.960 --> 07:18.400
(laughing)
This is my boy.

07:19.470 --> 07:20.840
Oh.

07:25.300 --> 07:26.640
Hmm.

07:28.760 --> 07:30.890
- Not a lot to go on there.
- Not really. Not really.

07:31.240 --> 07:32.310
- Good height.
- Good height.

07:32.350 --> 07:33.570
- Good height.
- Crazy tall.

07:33.580 --> 07:36.210
(growls)
Yeah, like 5'9".

07:36.410 --> 07:38.120
Heh...

07:38.680 --> 07:41.550
Come on. Come on. Come on.
(muttering)

07:42.230 --> 07:44.740
Come on. She's tall.
She's tall. She's tall.

07:44.770 --> 07:46.840
That's right. She's tall.
There's nothing to be done.

07:46.880 --> 07:48.280
Getting wet. Let me see...

07:48.380 --> 07:51.010
Let me see it from behind.
Let me see it from behind.

07:51.180 --> 07:52.980
That's how you hit it.
That's how you hit it.

07:52.980 --> 07:54.960
Jahari, can I tell you something
in confidence right now?

07:55.060 --> 07:56.480
Okay.

07:56.510 --> 07:57.370
(whispers)
I'm a virgin.

07:58.550 --> 08:00.620
(soul music)

08:01.580 --> 08:04.050
I went down to Georgia
a couple years ago,

08:04.140 --> 08:05.940
and I was just... oh...
(laughs)

08:06.080 --> 08:07.250
It's not funny, it's just...
(laughter)

08:07.290 --> 08:09.960
- That's...
- just... just a fact.

08:10.010 --> 08:12.310
It's just what happened.

08:12.370 --> 08:13.670
Trying to get
to the funny part.

08:13.700 --> 08:14.960
She's...
(laughs)

08:15.100 --> 08:17.230
White people come up to you.
"Hey.

08:18.040 --> 08:21.930
"So, you like Darius, huh?
You like Darius?"

08:22.310 --> 08:24.200
"What the [bleep]? Darius?
What are you talking to me..."

08:24.220 --> 08:26.350
- "You like Darius?"
- Darius Rucker?

08:26.400 --> 08:27.770
"Hootie, man. Hootie.

08:27.780 --> 08:28.820
Hootie, man.
Don't you love Hootie?

08:28.840 --> 08:30.000
He's huge down there.

08:30.070 --> 08:31.830
He's enormous.
As a country star.

08:31.850 --> 08:33.020
Darius Rucker.
Huge down there.

08:33.059 --> 08:34.850
There's only like three ever.
Charley Pride,

08:35.299 --> 08:36.450
Darius Rucker...

08:37.640 --> 08:38.809
There's only two.

08:38.809 --> 08:39.980
There's two of 'em.
(laughter)

08:41.650 --> 08:45.080
Ladies and gentlemen,
Darius Rucker.

08:45.150 --> 08:47.490
(cheers and applause)

08:50.440 --> 08:52.010
(whistling)

08:56.710 --> 08:58.970
(playing guitar)

08:58.990 --> 09:01.290
â™ª Don't go out
with my friends no more â™ª

09:01.340 --> 09:03.300
â™ª Don't wanna
hold your hand no more â™ª

09:03.860 --> 09:05.810
<i>Hootie, Hootie...</i>

09:05.830 --> 09:07.170
(crowd chanting)
Hootie, Hootie, Hootie...

09:07.210 --> 09:08.380
â™ª And I don't wanna
be with you â™ª

09:08.450 --> 09:11.150
<i>Hootie, Hootie, Hootie, Hootie...</i>

09:11.520 --> 09:13.350
- No, no.
- Hootie, Hootie...

09:13.440 --> 09:14.970
No, no, no, no.

09:15.490 --> 09:18.000
I'm not in Hootie
and the Blowfish anymore, y'all.

09:18.410 --> 09:19.580
Doing my own thing.

09:19.670 --> 09:21.590
What do you mean "in Hootie"?

09:21.660 --> 09:23.460
Because you are Hootie, man!

09:23.840 --> 09:26.510
- Come on, everybody!
- Hootie, Hootie...

09:26.550 --> 09:29.190
- Hootie, Hootie, Hootie...
- No, no...

09:29.230 --> 09:31.630
No, no, no, all right,
now... now... now stop it, stop it.

09:32.230 --> 09:36.000
I'm not Hootie.
I'm Darius Rucker. All right?

09:36.430 --> 09:37.810
I used to be the front man

09:37.900 --> 09:40.230
for a band called
Hootie & the Blowfish.

09:40.600 --> 09:42.280
All right,
but I was never Hootie.

09:42.630 --> 09:44.250
There was never a Hootie.

09:44.290 --> 09:45.840
Just... if I may...
if I may ask,

09:45.900 --> 09:47.750
where are the Blowfish at,
right, guys?

09:48.160 --> 09:50.260
Come on, everybody!
Blowfish!

09:50.330 --> 09:52.060
(chanting)
Blowfish, Blowfish, Blowfish...

09:52.200 --> 09:53.830
No, no, no! The...

09:53.920 --> 09:57.130
There are no people known
as "the Blowfish," y'all.

09:57.680 --> 09:58.560
Okay?

09:58.700 --> 10:01.550
The whole band was just called
Hootie & the Blowfish. That's it.

10:01.640 --> 10:03.330
It was a nonsense name.

10:03.460 --> 10:06.200
Like Hoobastank.
Or Toad the Wet Sprocket.

10:06.490 --> 10:07.520
Oh.

10:12.280 --> 10:15.020
(plays guitar)

10:15.040 --> 10:17.340
â™ª Don't go out
with my friends no more â™ª

10:17.350 --> 10:20.140
â™ª Don't wanna
hold your hand no more â™ª

10:21.010 --> 10:22.040
Oh! Oh!

10:22.080 --> 10:23.690
What? What is it, man?

10:23.730 --> 10:25.630
I see. I get it now.
I understand.

10:25.740 --> 10:27.510
Hey, we gotta pick, y'all!

10:27.620 --> 10:29.250
- We gotta choose between...
- No, no...

10:29.320 --> 10:31.290
Hootie <i>or</i> the Blowfish!

10:31.360 --> 10:34.320
So, who wants to see
the Blowfish?

10:34.390 --> 10:37.060
(crowd cheers)

10:38.540 --> 10:40.160
There's no Blowfish.

10:41.020 --> 10:42.710
And who wants
to see Hootie?

10:47.950 --> 10:49.640
Hey.

10:50.370 --> 10:52.470
Hey, that... that hurts
my feelings, y'all.

10:52.510 --> 10:53.980
Yeah, but you said
you weren't Hootie.

10:54.050 --> 10:55.820
No, I'm not, sir.

10:55.840 --> 10:58.390
But in the question
you just asked the audience,

10:58.410 --> 10:59.640
I-I was clearly Hootie.

10:59.820 --> 11:01.760
- So you are Hootie!
- I'm not, though.

11:01.780 --> 11:03.650
He is Hootie!
Yeah!

11:03.650 --> 11:04.550
No...
(crowd cheers)

11:05.560 --> 11:07.000
Hootie, Hootie...

11:07.120 --> 11:10.890
(chanting)
Hootie, Hootie, Hootie, Hootie,

11:10.910 --> 11:12.730
Hootie, Hootie,

11:12.820 --> 11:16.690
Hootie, Hootie, Hootie, Hootie,

11:16.710 --> 11:21.080
Hootie, Hootie, Hootie...
(crowd cheering)

11:21.200 --> 11:24.030
Hootie, Hootie, Hootie...

11:24.090 --> 11:26.640
(sobbing)
I'm Hootie!

11:29.060 --> 11:31.970
I'm Hootie! Aah!

11:32.460 --> 11:35.230
(bell rings)

11:35.890 --> 11:38.760
(students chattering)

11:38.820 --> 11:40.760
(chatter fades)

11:58.040 --> 11:59.350
I...

12:00.650 --> 12:02.160
am your substitute...

12:05.490 --> 12:07.190
Mr. Nostrand.

12:09.030 --> 12:11.660
But that might as well say,
"No nonsense,"

12:12.160 --> 12:13.480
because I...

12:14.060 --> 12:16.400
do not...
play.

12:17.820 --> 12:20.440
Now, today will not be
a day off.

12:21.270 --> 12:24.360
In fact, today,
you will work harder than...

12:25.400 --> 12:26.600
(farts)

12:26.670 --> 12:27.760
(farts quietly)

12:37.240 --> 12:38.470
(laughing)

12:40.370 --> 12:42.260
<i>Somebody call
a Code Brown up in here.</i>

12:43.380 --> 12:45.210
<i>See you later,
Mr. Pootstrand!</i>

12:47.350 --> 12:48.840
(soul music)

12:50.650 --> 12:52.030
Jordan and I
love action movies.

12:52.040 --> 12:53.860
We love, you know, movies
where people are trying to...

12:53.870 --> 12:55.210
you know, smuggle contra...

12:55.210 --> 12:56.890
Like, <i>Breaking Bad</i>'s
like our favorite show.

12:56.910 --> 12:59.680
Mm-hmm. Yeah.
(cheers and applause)

12:59.830 --> 13:01.760
Also like <i>The Wire</i>
and <i>New Jack City.</i>

13:01.805 --> 13:03.175
Yeah,
like that kind of stuff.

13:03.195 --> 13:04.692
- And anything that like...
- It intrigues us, yeah.

13:04.745 --> 13:07.201
Yeah, portrays African-Americans
as criminals.

13:07.231 --> 13:08.049
In the worst possible light.

13:08.050 --> 13:09.054
We just...

13:09.095 --> 13:11.965
- We love that. We love that.
- So, shame on us.

13:12.060 --> 13:14.060
But something
that always cracks me up.

13:14.105 --> 13:17.005
I love when you see cops
and DEA agents when they bust...

13:17.025 --> 13:18.715
You know, they bust
a whole bunch of cocaine.

13:18.780 --> 13:19.849
- Oh, yeah.
- And I lo...

13:19.850 --> 13:21.806
This is my favorite thing.
It's like, "Give it here."

13:21.880 --> 13:22.517
(sniffs)

13:22.575 --> 13:23.536
Like, come on.

13:23.540 --> 13:26.240
"That's 100% pure."
(laughter)

13:26.510 --> 13:28.840
I want to become a cop
just so I can go to that class.

13:28.885 --> 13:30.415
I just want to
go to that class

13:30.460 --> 13:32.195
where the cop's
just supposed to go...

13:32.235 --> 13:33.635
- "Get in there..." (grumbling)
- Yeah.

13:33.680 --> 13:35.462
"I don't know if it's pure.
Hold on." (sniffs)

13:35.520 --> 13:37.901
"Let me just
crack that up in there.

13:37.950 --> 13:39.350
"Make sure that...

13:39.420 --> 13:41.948
"I'm not sure yet if it's pure.
Hold on a second.

13:42.676 --> 13:45.273
'This could be only 80% pure.
Aah..."

13:46.573 --> 13:49.573
(dramatic music)

13:49.643 --> 13:52.024
â™ª

14:08.468 --> 14:10.814
Eight kilos.
100%.

14:10.926 --> 14:13.866
Pure grade afghani heroin.

14:18.867 --> 14:20.586
(sniffs)

14:21.548 --> 14:22.900
(squeaky sniff)

14:29.121 --> 14:31.651
$100,000 U.S. dollars.

14:34.885 --> 14:36.255
Hold up.

14:36.325 --> 14:38.303
We should count it first.

14:38.310 --> 14:39.341
Mm. Mm-hmm.

14:42.322 --> 14:43.898
Be my guest.

14:57.866 --> 15:00.288
You know, we gonna do
a straight count on this right now.

15:00.342 --> 15:01.830
- Count it... count it?
- Yeah. Just...

15:01.830 --> 15:02.934
- Good idea.
- Mm-hmm.

15:03.004 --> 15:03.934
Should probably do it fast

15:03.943 --> 15:05.840
so we don't make
our friends here wait.

15:05.866 --> 15:07.271
Mm-hmm. Okay.
(clears throat)

15:07.746 --> 15:11.628
20, 40, 60, 80,

15:12.238 --> 15:16.087
100, 20, 40, 60,

15:16.417 --> 15:17.887
80, 200...

15:18.044 --> 15:19.884
Hey, you know what? I'm fast.
Let me just do it.

15:19.889 --> 15:21.289
- You want... okay.
- I'll take care of that.

15:21.349 --> 15:22.793
1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6, 7, 8, 9...

15:22.870 --> 15:24.800
1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6, 7, 8, 9...

15:24.838 --> 15:26.408
1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6, 7, 8, 9...

15:26.468 --> 15:27.838
Hey, why... why are you
doin' piles of nine?

15:27.908 --> 15:29.408
- It's faster than 10s.
- Oh, really?

15:29.478 --> 15:32.808
I do my nines 10 times, and
then I do an extra pile of 10.

15:32.813 --> 15:34.843
Fast. Okay. Yeah, yeah.

15:34.913 --> 15:36.480
You know, we... we should
probably both be counting.

15:36.512 --> 15:37.972
Oh, well, let's get to it.

15:37.977 --> 15:39.747
That's dou... double trouble.
All right.

15:39.785 --> 15:41.945
- And, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9...
- 20, 40, 60...

15:41.959 --> 15:44.063
- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9...
- 80, 100, 20, 40,

15:44.063 --> 15:46.263
1, 2, 3, 4... Wait.

15:46.280 --> 15:47.420
Okay, I'm sorry, can you...
could you ple...

15:47.420 --> 15:48.974
Could you do something
like over there?

15:48.974 --> 15:50.583
- Yup. I'm gonna take.
- Please, it's a little distracting.

15:50.690 --> 15:51.730
- Oh, you know what?
- What's that?

15:51.897 --> 15:53.027
I got it.
We could time me.

15:53.029 --> 15:53.681
(gasps) Okay.

15:53.682 --> 15:56.020
Okay, we time me
counting out 1,000.

15:56.020 --> 15:57.245
We take that time,
and then

15:57.290 --> 16:01.191
we just count money
for that time times 100.

16:03.130 --> 16:05.230
No! I g... I got it.
This is it right here.

16:05.524 --> 16:09.164
I'm gonna do a web search
for a picture of $100,000.

16:09.274 --> 16:10.098
- Okay?
- Okay.

16:10.130 --> 16:12.194
Then, you know, we'll know
what it's supposed to look like

16:12.194 --> 16:13.828
and then we can
arrange our money

16:13.895 --> 16:15.195
to look exactly like it.

16:15.465 --> 16:17.565
And see... here. Hey. Here we go.
Right here, look.

16:18.138 --> 16:19.404
I mean, damn, that looks...

16:19.425 --> 16:21.155
That looks just like...
a lot like our money.

16:21.200 --> 16:23.205
I think we got
$100,000 here, folks.

16:23.318 --> 16:25.036
- I think we made it.
- No, that is our money.

16:25.147 --> 16:27.247
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, do...
Earlier...

16:27.267 --> 16:27.824
Yeah.

16:27.895 --> 16:30.173
When we were counting,
I took a picture of our money

16:30.189 --> 16:31.834
so I could upload it
on Yahoo! Answers.

16:31.854 --> 16:33.025
- Oh, damn.
- That's right.

16:33.040 --> 16:34.465
'cause I just wanted to see
if anyone could verify

16:34.489 --> 16:35.959
- what $100,000 looked like.
- [bleep]!

16:36.004 --> 16:37.174
- Oh, you got it.
- What was I thinking?

16:37.204 --> 16:38.404
- You got it.
- I got it, man.

16:38.404 --> 16:39.474
- Go, go, go, go.
- I got it, I got it.

16:39.811 --> 16:41.220
What the hell
are you doing, man?

16:41.220 --> 16:43.090
I th... you know,
I was gonna try to <i>Rain Man</i> it.

16:43.319 --> 16:44.889
- Oh, that's a plan right there.
- That's right.

16:44.889 --> 16:46.711
- Okay, yeah, here we go.
- We can do that.

16:46.868 --> 16:48.159
Okay.

16:54.574 --> 16:56.444
Yup, yup. I got that.
I got that.

16:56.479 --> 16:58.349
20, 40, 60...

17:00.945 --> 17:02.933
99,980.

17:04.684 --> 17:07.684
(dramatic music)

17:07.704 --> 17:09.140
â™ª

17:10.684 --> 17:11.654
(gunfire)

17:12.173 --> 17:14.373
(groaning)

17:17.597 --> 17:19.309
(panting)

17:27.900 --> 17:29.570
(soul music)

17:30.830 --> 17:33.974
You guys ever hear...
You guys know the old standard,

17:34.000 --> 17:36.427
Uh, "It's Co..." is it called,
"It's Cold Outside?"

17:36.430 --> 17:37.660
- "Baby, It's Cold Outside."
- "Baby, It's Cold Outside."

17:37.710 --> 17:39.182
You know this old standard?
Right, yeah.

17:39.200 --> 17:40.791
(scattered applause)
'30s and '40s.

17:40.820 --> 17:42.036
And so many people
have covered it.

17:42.070 --> 17:43.726
It was written in like 1939
or something like that.

17:44.060 --> 17:47.468
It's funny, when you listen
to the lyrics of the song, uh...

17:48.020 --> 17:48.959
It's kinda <i>rapey</i>.

17:49.010 --> 17:50.235
- It's a little rapey.
- It's a little rapey.

17:50.260 --> 17:52.330
It's like...
(laughter)

17:52.640 --> 17:53.640
It's true.

17:53.660 --> 17:55.541
She said
she wanted to leave...

17:56.770 --> 17:58.310
You told her
it was cold outside.

17:58.780 --> 18:01.655
It's winter. She's very aware of
the fact that it's cold outside.

18:02.290 --> 18:03.650
She's not stup...
you know what I'm saying?

18:03.660 --> 18:05.113
- Yeah.
- "No" means no. Right?

18:05.160 --> 18:06.124
- Oh, yeah.
- You know?

18:06.180 --> 18:08.180
And this was... I got...
I got creeped out...

18:08.210 --> 18:10.031
'cause I dr... I... In this scene
you're about to watch,

18:10.070 --> 18:11.095
I dressed up like a woman.

18:11.328 --> 18:13.598
Lot of brothers like, "Man,
he dress up like a woman a lot."

18:13.687 --> 18:15.787
(laughter)
I'm just...

18:15.819 --> 18:18.189
just in touch
with my feminine side.

18:18.995 --> 18:20.770
(laughs)
Whoo! Thank you, girls.

18:20.779 --> 18:21.261
Yes.

18:21.261 --> 18:23.291
But no, this one was confusing
for me because I was...

18:23.353 --> 18:25.470
I... fir... I'm hot.
I'm hot.

18:25.539 --> 18:26.424
And so it's creepy.

18:26.430 --> 18:27.630
You don't want
to look in the mirror

18:27.661 --> 18:29.679
and be attracted to yourself.
Be like the... (laughter)

18:29.960 --> 18:33.146
dude from <i>Silence of the Lambs</i>.
"I'd [bleep] me."

18:33.163 --> 18:34.633
You don't want that.
(laughter)

18:34.703 --> 18:35.773
Ah!

18:38.284 --> 18:41.124
(orchestral note)

18:43.140 --> 18:46.280
(jazzy standard music)

18:46.325 --> 18:48.418
â™ª Would you look at the time? â™ª

18:48.418 --> 18:50.576
â™ª You should just stay here tonight â™ª

18:50.576 --> 18:52.399
â™ª I've had too much wine â™ª

18:52.413 --> 18:54.173
â™ª You will leave
at first light â™ª

18:54.546 --> 18:56.486
â™ª It isn't that far â™ª

18:56.486 --> 18:57.795
â™ª Baby, just stay where you are â™ª

18:57.868 --> 18:59.378
â™ª Back to my place â™ª

18:59.407 --> 19:02.207
â™ª You can't escape
from my embrace â™ª

19:02.665 --> 19:05.132
â™ª I really had a very nice time â™ª

19:05.260 --> 19:07.260
â™ª Let me just refill that wine â™ª

19:07.330 --> 19:09.460
â™ª But I really need
to just say good-bye â™ª

19:09.530 --> 19:11.230
â™ª I would love to see you try â™ª

19:11.300 --> 19:12.722
â™ª Please unlock this door â™ª

19:12.736 --> 19:14.766
â™ª it's locked from the outside â™ª

19:14.806 --> 19:18.064
- â™ª Babe, you're mine tonight â™ª
- â™ª I cannot stay tonight â™ª

19:18.776 --> 19:20.436
â™ª Look, I really have to go â™ª

19:20.476 --> 19:22.446
â™ª No, you really have to stay â™ª

19:22.456 --> 19:24.256
â™ª Hey, "no" means no â™ª

19:24.285 --> 19:26.555
â™ª That is what they all say â™ª

19:26.555 --> 19:28.213
â™ª You're hurting my arm â™ª

19:28.213 --> 19:29.943
â™ª I won't cause you any harm â™ª

19:29.983 --> 19:31.543
â™ª Let go of me â™ª

19:31.582 --> 19:34.222
â™ª We can make this hard
or just easy â™ª

19:34.647 --> 19:37.487
â™ª A woman always
comes prepared â™ª

19:37.496 --> 19:38.796
â™ª Ooh, I'm really scared â™ª

19:38.805 --> 19:40.735
â™ª I said this is not what I want â™ª

19:40.775 --> 19:42.475
â™ª Why you have to be such a... â™ª

19:42.514 --> 19:44.474
â™ª I know self-defense â™ª

19:44.514 --> 19:46.454
â™ª I dare you to try it â™ª

19:46.575 --> 19:48.675
â™ª I don't want to fight â™ª

19:48.745 --> 19:52.157
