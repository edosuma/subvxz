(eerie music)
(coughing)

01:01.891 --> 01:03.974
- [Stuart] Where are you?

01:05.227 --> 01:06.832
No shit.

01:06.832 --> 01:07.915
I'll open up.

01:12.478 --> 01:17.228
(eerie music)
(coughing)

01:38.808 --> 01:40.891
- Uncle Stuart.
- Come on.

01:42.558 --> 01:44.740
- [Nash] How are you?

01:44.740 --> 01:47.500
- I'm alright. (coughing)

01:47.500 --> 01:49.115
- So this is it huh?

01:49.115 --> 01:53.751
- Yeah this is it. (coughing)

01:53.751 --> 01:54.584
(laughing)

01:54.584 --> 01:55.785
- You don't look good Uncle.

01:55.785 --> 01:56.785
- Oh thanks.

01:57.867 --> 01:59.221
- Seriously Uncle maybe you should

01:59.221 --> 02:01.009
check yourself out at the ER.

02:01.009 --> 02:02.705
The hospital's a few blocks away.

02:02.705 --> 02:05.496
- I'll be back tomorrow a.m.

02:05.496 --> 02:09.246
It's just a cold. (coughing)

02:15.212 --> 02:19.962
(eerie music)
(coughing)

02:29.563 --> 02:31.187
Thanks for doing this for me.

02:31.187 --> 02:33.268
- Think nothing of it Uncle.

02:33.268 --> 02:34.506
- There's not much to do

02:34.506 --> 02:37.402
except keeping your eyes open for thieves.

02:37.402 --> 02:38.673
- I'll shoot 'em down with my guitar.

02:38.673 --> 02:41.607
(mimicking gun firing)
(laughing)

02:41.607 --> 02:42.690
- I know kid.

02:43.601 --> 02:47.520
You are a killer.
(laughing)

02:47.520 --> 02:52.291
I'll let myself out. (coughing)

02:52.291 --> 02:53.458
- Feel better.

03:12.635 --> 03:15.802
(eerie voice echoing)

03:38.331 --> 03:41.664
(acoustic guitar music)

03:50.372 --> 03:52.539
(sighing)

04:11.256 --> 04:13.923
(phone dialing)

04:17.303 --> 04:18.856
(phone ringing)

04:18.856 --> 04:20.358
- [David] Yo.

04:20.358 --> 04:22.435
- Just dialed your number
with my eyes shut dude.

04:22.435 --> 04:23.934
- [David] No shit.

04:23.934 --> 04:27.552
- That's funny huh?
- Where are you?

04:27.552 --> 04:29.457
- Where are you David?

04:29.457 --> 04:30.290
- [David] I'm with my girlfriend.

04:30.290 --> 04:32.550
- Great man, come over, I'm
at my Uncle's warehouse.

04:32.550 --> 04:34.021
- [David] What's there?

04:34.021 --> 04:36.133
- He's sick, I'm doing him a favor.

04:36.133 --> 04:38.319
We can party here.

04:38.319 --> 04:41.539
He's got a stash of drinks
and I've got some smokes.

04:41.539 --> 04:43.704
- [David] That's a
pretty attractive offer.

04:43.704 --> 04:45.595
- I can see why he became an alcoholic.

04:45.595 --> 04:47.683
- [David] Why's that?

04:47.683 --> 04:48.601
- The guy's doing security work

04:48.601 --> 04:51.272
for a warehouse that has
nothing worth stealing.

04:51.272 --> 04:52.557
Damn boring job.

04:52.557 --> 04:54.305
Been doing it for 30 years.

04:54.305 --> 04:56.509
- [David] Does he have scotch?

04:56.509 --> 04:57.893
- That's all he drinks.

04:57.893 --> 05:00.824
- [David] Fuck it, we're on our way.

05:00.824 --> 05:01.907
- Later dude.

05:12.761 --> 05:15.261
(eerie music)

05:24.455 --> 05:25.769
Hey you!

05:25.769 --> 05:26.602
I saw you.

05:27.551 --> 05:30.051
(eerie music)

06:06.069 --> 06:08.134
(clanging)

06:08.134 --> 06:08.967
Shit.

06:10.149 --> 06:11.316
What was that?

06:17.633 --> 06:18.633
I need help.

06:21.369 --> 06:23.619
(laughing)

06:28.843 --> 06:30.421
Killer.

06:30.421 --> 06:33.421
(suspenseful music)

06:39.953 --> 06:42.203
(clanging)

06:43.361 --> 06:45.528
Come on I'm ready for you.

06:48.293 --> 06:49.126
Coward.

06:50.151 --> 06:53.651
Next time I'll eliminate you motherfucker.

06:54.503 --> 06:57.170
(phone ringing)

07:00.430 --> 07:01.263
Yeah?

07:02.247 --> 07:03.080
David.

07:04.687 --> 07:06.191
You're here?

07:06.191 --> 07:07.108
I'm coming.

07:08.290 --> 07:10.790
(eerie music)

07:18.918 --> 07:21.168
(rattling)

07:36.015 --> 07:36.904
Hey guys.

07:36.904 --> 07:38.904
- What's up buddy?
- Hey.

07:41.457 --> 07:42.884
- That was fast.

07:42.884 --> 07:44.311
- Hey we came here to rescue you.

07:44.311 --> 07:45.989
- We're good friends.

07:45.989 --> 07:48.210
- I always wanted to be your friend Nancy.

07:48.210 --> 07:50.113
- Dude why'd you close the door?

07:50.113 --> 07:50.946
- House rules.

07:50.946 --> 07:52.532
- My friend is--
- What friend?

07:52.532 --> 07:54.558
- Leila.
- My friend.

07:54.558 --> 07:56.510
- Man just open the door.

07:56.510 --> 07:57.343
- What?

08:05.523 --> 08:06.523
Oh, come in.

08:14.276 --> 08:16.776
(tense music)

08:18.509 --> 08:20.409
I'm sorry I didn't know
you were out there.

08:20.409 --> 08:23.409
- This is Nash, David's best friend.

08:24.532 --> 08:27.032
- I'm also Nancy's friend too.

08:27.975 --> 08:29.225
Follow me guys.

08:32.044 --> 08:34.508
- Where are you going?

08:34.508 --> 08:36.063
- Nowhere.

08:36.063 --> 08:37.686
- [Nancy] Then come with us.

08:37.686 --> 08:40.602
(fingers snapping)

08:54.401 --> 08:55.455
- Drink guys?

08:55.455 --> 08:57.498
- Hope you have glasses.

08:57.498 --> 09:02.498
- I think it's a better idea
that we don't have glasses.

09:02.921 --> 09:05.844
(instrumental music)

09:05.844 --> 09:08.344
Second thought, glasses, yeah.

09:11.886 --> 09:12.719
Mugs.

09:14.276 --> 09:16.941
- Just pour the drinks dude.

09:16.941 --> 09:18.691
- Alright here we go.

09:27.658 --> 09:31.342
- David don't be a bore, let's toast.

09:31.342 --> 09:34.425
(instrumental music)

09:39.376 --> 09:42.709
- You always have the best insults babe.

09:45.103 --> 09:47.779
- Bore, such a weird term to use.

09:47.779 --> 09:48.950
It's not even an insult.

09:48.950 --> 09:50.368
- What the fuck do you know?

09:50.368 --> 09:51.201
- To us.

09:52.300 --> 09:53.957
- Isn't she great with words?

09:53.957 --> 09:55.374
- Fuck off David.

10:02.882 --> 10:06.299
- Dude that woman cannot live without me.

10:10.777 --> 10:12.222
- You okay?

10:12.222 --> 10:13.472
- Very much so.

10:15.371 --> 10:16.204
- Really?

10:18.873 --> 10:20.623
Sorry, couldn't tell.

10:22.900 --> 10:25.406
- How could you, you don't even know me.

10:25.406 --> 10:26.792
I'm quite okay.

10:26.792 --> 10:29.292
(tense music)

10:43.113 --> 10:44.953
- [David] Hey.

10:44.953 --> 10:47.723
- Why do you always turn on
me when we're having fun?

10:47.723 --> 10:48.691
- Baby.

10:48.691 --> 10:50.672
- Especially in front of your friends.

10:50.672 --> 10:51.769
- Honey come on.

10:51.769 --> 10:53.602
- I'm gonna leave you.

11:03.163 --> 11:05.913
(dramatic music)

11:12.241 --> 11:14.733
- [Nash] So Leila what do you do?

11:14.733 --> 11:15.650
- Not much.

11:16.968 --> 11:19.167
- [Nash] You must do something.

11:19.167 --> 11:20.768
- Why are you so curious?

11:20.768 --> 11:24.018
- [Nash] I'm usually not but, now I am.

11:25.576 --> 11:26.743
- Makes sense.

11:28.004 --> 11:29.948
- You go to school?

11:29.948 --> 11:31.840
- I took this year off.

11:31.840 --> 11:36.000
Next year I go to college
to study creative writing.

11:36.000 --> 11:37.812
- Cool stuff.

11:37.812 --> 11:42.315
- Actually I wanted to be a
film director, make films.

11:42.315 --> 11:44.571
- [Nash] Why the change of heart?

11:44.571 --> 11:46.567
- Cinema is dead.

11:46.567 --> 11:49.706
I hate all those fast
mindless camera moves.

11:49.706 --> 11:50.539
- Seriously?

11:50.539 --> 11:55.289
I love the fast camera moves,
especially when I'm stoned.

11:58.170 --> 12:00.920
(dramatic music)

12:07.865 --> 12:09.782
- This place is creepy.

12:11.302 --> 12:16.052
- [Nash] This place is as dead
as you claim cinema to be.

12:17.211 --> 12:20.211
- How long have you worked here for?

12:21.057 --> 12:24.575
- About an hour. (laughing)

12:24.575 --> 12:26.039
My uncle does security here.

12:26.039 --> 12:27.708
Guy's been doing it for 30 years.

12:27.708 --> 12:29.708
Nothing's ever happened.

12:31.585 --> 12:33.617
- You're so wrong.

12:33.617 --> 12:36.784
I'm so confident this place is spooky.

12:40.469 --> 12:42.969
(eerie music)

13:22.667 --> 13:24.834
(moaning)

13:39.380 --> 13:41.797
- Are you okay?
- You tell me.

13:44.586 --> 13:46.169
Wow.

13:46.169 --> 13:48.108
I didn't know we had company.

13:48.108 --> 13:50.025
- I was just checking this place.

13:50.025 --> 13:51.025
- Excuse us.

13:54.156 --> 13:54.989
- So.

13:59.201 --> 14:00.982
What's going on?

14:00.982 --> 14:01.815
- Oh not much.

14:01.815 --> 14:03.669
I was just going down on--
- Here we go again.

14:03.669 --> 14:05.086
Shut the hell up.

14:06.722 --> 14:08.479
Come on, boys will be boys.

14:08.479 --> 14:09.312
- Women.

14:11.094 --> 14:14.094
- Man, that Leila broad is a weirdo.

14:15.297 --> 14:17.412
- Actually I like her.

14:17.412 --> 14:21.271
- Then go fuck her so I can
have Nancy to myself man.

14:21.271 --> 14:22.604
Where you going?

14:24.009 --> 14:27.023
- I need some booze and some smokes.

14:27.023 --> 14:29.893
- Yeah that's cool, I'll join you.

14:29.893 --> 14:34.812
- [Nancy] Sometimes I don't
know what to do with him.

14:34.812 --> 14:37.195
- [Leila] It's all about their dicks.

14:37.195 --> 14:39.037
- I agree with you.

14:39.037 --> 14:42.883
I wonder what happens when they
can't get it up any longer.

14:42.883 --> 14:45.050
- They're dead then.
- Wow.

14:47.611 --> 14:51.861
- Why don't you just break
up with him or kill him?

14:52.849 --> 14:54.307
- I love him.

14:54.307 --> 14:56.974
(voice echoing)

15:00.021 --> 15:02.521
(eerie music)

16:04.041 --> 16:06.291
(clanging)

16:08.354 --> 16:11.104
(acoustic music)

16:51.533 --> 16:53.533
Where were you?
- Around.

16:55.920 --> 16:58.337
- You been running?
- Sort of.

17:05.921 --> 17:07.003
- [Nash] Wow.

17:09.958 --> 17:11.625
- What, I'm thirsty.

17:12.465 --> 17:13.667
(laughing)

17:13.667 --> 17:14.501
- Cool.

17:15.454 --> 17:16.788
I'm thirsty too.

17:21.650 --> 17:22.483
- Hey.

17:23.611 --> 17:24.861
I'm sorry babe.

17:40.653 --> 17:42.736
- They are truly in love.

17:55.549 --> 17:56.632
What's wrong?

17:58.429 --> 17:59.262
- Why?

18:00.676 --> 18:02.766
- Well I just said something quite cool

18:02.766 --> 18:05.596
and you didn't even have a response.

18:05.596 --> 18:07.601
- I'm sorry I didn't hear you.

18:07.601 --> 18:10.382
- Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.

18:10.382 --> 18:13.799
I said David and Nancy are truly in love.

18:17.475 --> 18:19.558
- And I'm happy for them.

18:20.490 --> 18:21.990
- Are you in love?

18:23.726 --> 18:27.059
- If I were would that change your mind?

18:27.939 --> 18:30.404
- Change my mind on what?

18:30.404 --> 18:31.737
- On fucking me.

18:34.436 --> 18:36.103
You're good looking.

18:39.218 --> 18:41.635
But it's not going to happen.

18:47.380 --> 18:50.130
(dramatic music)

19:09.432 --> 19:12.496
- Hey, Leila was watching
us when we were making out.

19:12.496 --> 19:13.749
- How do you know that?

19:13.749 --> 19:14.768
- Why are you defending her?

19:14.768 --> 19:17.344
- How could you see, your
head was buried between my--

19:17.344 --> 19:19.882
- Alright, alright, I may
have snuck a bit of a peek.

19:19.882 --> 19:22.706
- Instead of giving all you have to me?

19:22.706 --> 19:26.015
- Babe why are you so harsh with me?

19:26.015 --> 19:28.856
- Because you don't respect me.

19:28.856 --> 19:29.689
- I love you.

19:29.689 --> 19:31.641
- That doesn't mean you respect me.

19:31.641 --> 19:32.474
- Do you love me?

19:32.474 --> 19:35.617
- You know I do, but I
need you to respect me.

19:35.617 --> 19:38.700
- I do, babe, you know I respect you.

19:40.000 --> 19:42.500
(eerie music)

19:58.967 --> 20:02.134
(eerie voice echoing)

20:11.848 --> 20:14.364
- I love horror films.

20:14.364 --> 20:18.637
Even novels that scare the shit out of me.

20:18.637 --> 20:21.470
I don't even relate to my friends.

20:22.812 --> 20:27.395
I think when you feel rejected
you must defend yourself

20:29.557 --> 20:32.807
and then you must find a place to hide.

20:35.271 --> 20:37.771
My parents are selfish pricks.

20:38.833 --> 20:41.187
My father has fallen in love with himself

20:41.187 --> 20:44.187
to the extent that he has a mistress

20:45.648 --> 20:49.648
and my mom, she hates him
with so much intensity

20:50.658 --> 20:52.733
that she decided to fall
in love with herself

20:52.733 --> 20:56.316
and avoid all other
creatures including me.

21:00.032 --> 21:03.782
- I'm sorry to know that
you're in such pain.

21:05.140 --> 21:07.307
(moaning)

21:09.364 --> 21:10.744
(eerie voice echoing)

21:10.744 --> 21:12.582
- Do you hear that?
- Hear what?

21:12.582 --> 21:15.209

21:15.209 --> 21:17.161
Let's get out of here.

21:17.161 --> 21:20.911

where we can lay down.

21:22.350 --> 21:25.850

21:27.758 --> 21:30.081

21:30.081 --> 21:31.664

there at the wood depot.

30:09.108 --> 30:12.751
or the woman they light up a cigarette?

41:01.815 --> 41:04.398
- Thanks for your noble effort.

41:05.286 --> 41:06.786
- Fuck off weirdo.

41:09.372 --> 41:10.963
- Honey did you find her?

41:10.963 --> 41:15.630
- [David] Yeah she's over
there hiding behind the boxes.

41:21.164 --> 41:23.164
- What's wrong with you?

41:24.181 --> 41:26.882
- If I told you you wouldn't believe me.

41:26.882 --> 41:27.715
- Try me.

41:31.511 --> 41:33.261
- I met this monster.

41:35.378 --> 41:38.378
No, more like a weird looking human.

41:40.753 --> 41:42.277
- Come on honey let's go.

41:42.277 --> 41:43.360
- I told you.

41:45.225 --> 41:47.090
- You always seem to find a way to spoil

41:47.090 --> 41:52.045
any good time that I might
have or you might have.

41:52.045 --> 41:53.976
- People are strange.

41:53.976 --> 41:55.881
- You're always down.

41:55.881 --> 41:58.605
Jesus what more can I do for you?

41:58.605 --> 42:01.192
- Friends like you make me down.

42:01.192 --> 42:03.275
- What a thankless bitch.

42:05.066 --> 42:10.066
- I always felt you befriended
me out of pity, nothing more.

42:28.046 --> 42:31.624
- Why do I have the feeling
that things are not going well?

42:31.624 --> 42:33.978
- I want to go home.

42:33.978 --> 42:35.677
- Baby we still have plenty more to drink

42:35.677 --> 42:38.677
and a whole stash to smoke, why now?

42:40.426 --> 42:43.359
- I need to go home before it's too late.

42:43.359 --> 42:44.750
- It's two a.m.

42:44.750 --> 42:48.662
It's not late, it's early
and why are you whispering?

42:48.662 --> 42:52.079
- Fine you guys stay and I'll call a cab.

42:55.649 --> 42:58.149
(eerie music)

43:12.314 --> 43:14.302
The phone's dead.

43:14.302 --> 43:15.885
- So sit and relax.

43:19.934 --> 43:21.307
Here.

43:21.307 --> 43:22.297
- No, it's fine.

43:22.297 --> 43:24.714
- Hey it'll do you some good.

43:28.512 --> 43:31.262
(dramatic music)

43:41.351 --> 43:42.326
- [Nash] Boo.

43:42.326 --> 43:44.076
- Shit you scared me.

43:45.475 --> 43:46.308
- Sorry.

43:47.325 --> 43:48.410
Did you find Leila?

43:48.410 --> 43:50.558
- Yeah she was just sitting here.

43:50.558 --> 43:51.734
- Is she okay?

43:51.734 --> 43:55.748
- Yeah, she just likes to
draw attention to herself.

43:55.748 --> 43:56.780
- You see I don't know
why she has to do that.

43:56.780 --> 43:59.363
I mean she's so damn beautiful.

44:01.164 --> 44:01.997
You too.

44:03.617 --> 44:04.450
Very hot.

44:05.348 --> 44:07.431
- Hot, but not beautiful.

44:08.803 --> 44:11.720
- Very hot and very very beautiful.

44:15.496 --> 44:18.668
- How come you never
said that to me before?

44:18.668 --> 44:19.501
- Well.

44:21.708 --> 44:24.101
- You didn't want to?

44:24.101 --> 44:26.310
(laughing)

44:26.310 --> 44:29.621
- It crossed my mind
but I mean you're taken.

44:29.621 --> 44:30.454
- Not yet.

44:32.259 --> 44:34.009
- David and you?
- So.

44:35.700 --> 44:37.200
- Let me show you.

44:46.964 --> 44:49.297
You see, I belong to no one.

44:50.897 --> 44:52.514
(laughing)

44:52.514 --> 44:55.264
(dramatic music)

44:57.785 --> 45:00.035
(laughing)

45:05.744 --> 45:07.244
- Oh this is cute.

45:17.315 --> 45:18.973
Oh that was cute.

45:18.973 --> 45:20.956
- Don't be jealous silly.

45:20.956 --> 45:22.138
- Are you kidding me?

45:22.138 --> 45:23.612
Holding hands isn't fucking.

45:23.612 --> 45:25.612
- Now you're being rude.

45:27.478 --> 45:29.968
(sighing)

45:29.968 --> 45:31.197
- You okay?

45:31.197 --> 45:32.375
- I'm fine.

45:32.375 --> 45:36.125
I wanted to call a taxi
but the phone's dead.

45:40.242 --> 45:42.742
- Stop staring at me like that.

45:42.742 --> 45:45.159
- Yeah you're right, no line.

45:46.003 --> 45:48.235
You can always use my cellphone.

45:48.235 --> 45:49.652
- Hey, come here.

45:51.996 --> 45:54.579
- Let's leave the lovers alone.

45:56.978 --> 45:58.612
- I told you to come and sit.

45:58.612 --> 46:02.411
- I love it when you're
jealous, it is sexy.

46:02.411 --> 46:05.118
- Holding hands does not make me jealous.

46:05.118 --> 46:06.201
- Maybe more.

46:10.201 --> 46:12.359
- I'm high, I'm loaded,

46:12.359 --> 46:15.609
why do you want to go and kill my buzz?

46:19.512 --> 46:21.345
- I just need to know.

46:22.301 --> 46:23.301
- Know what?

46:25.725 --> 46:28.225
(eerie music)

46:41.282 --> 46:43.717
- I really want to go home.

46:43.717 --> 46:44.550
- What's the rush?

46:44.550 --> 46:47.106
We're both having fun aren't we?

46:47.106 --> 46:49.189
- It's a strange feeling.

46:51.149 --> 46:52.232
I want to go,

46:54.938 --> 46:56.855
but yet I want to stay.

47:02.380 --> 47:04.297
- I really do like you.

47:05.352 --> 47:06.185
- Thanks.

47:10.808 --> 47:11.891
Please don't.

47:13.346 --> 47:14.485
- [Nash] You know why you gotta pretend?

47:14.485 --> 47:18.218
You want me just as bad as I want you.

47:18.218 --> 47:20.635
- What are you talking about?

47:26.406 --> 47:28.498
- Are you fucking crazy?

47:28.498 --> 47:29.723
I don't want you.

47:29.723 --> 47:31.024
- I don't think you fucking
know what you want yourself.

47:31.024 --> 47:33.881
One minute you're kissing me,
the next minute you're not.

47:33.881 --> 47:35.033
Fuck that baby.

47:35.033 --> 47:36.426
In that little fucking head of yours

47:36.426 --> 47:38.293
you pretend you want to fuck me.

47:38.293 --> 47:39.210
- Fuck off!

47:45.980 --> 47:48.980
(suspenseful music)

47:52.149 --> 47:54.066
Please, help me please.

47:59.022 --> 48:00.525
(gasping)

48:00.525 --> 48:01.358
- Leila?

48:04.100 --> 48:06.559
Where'd you go baby?

48:06.559 --> 48:09.726
You still got some business to finish.

48:11.220 --> 48:12.720
- Help me, please.

48:15.427 --> 48:18.427
(suspenseful music)

48:23.736 --> 48:26.716
(gasping)

48:26.716 --> 48:29.222
- [Dracula] Stay where you are.

48:29.222 --> 48:31.882
Nothing will happen to you.

48:31.882 --> 48:34.215
I am your protector my love.

48:36.815 --> 48:38.482
Gently, gently baby.

48:40.270 --> 48:43.437
I've been in this crate for 200 years.

48:44.371 --> 48:45.788
Everything hurts.

48:48.144 --> 48:51.227
(heartbeat thumping)

49:01.904 --> 49:02.737
- Shit.

49:05.065 --> 49:06.750
Where'd she go?

49:06.750 --> 49:09.833
(heartbeat thumping)

49:19.928 --> 49:22.261
- [Leila] Tell me about you.

49:39.415 --> 49:43.832
- I have been dead in this
crate for about 200 years.

49:46.397 --> 49:50.499
- You're talking, a dead
person doesn't do that.

49:50.499 --> 49:52.249
- My spirit is alive.

49:53.700 --> 49:55.450
Physically I am dead.

49:56.604 --> 49:57.521
Look at me.

50:00.792 --> 50:02.709
- What happened to you?

50:06.166 --> 50:10.999
- My story is a legend and you
ask me what happened to me?

50:13.060 --> 50:13.893
I am him.

50:16.639 --> 50:21.639
Justice has promised to me in
the spirit of a young princess

50:22.250 --> 50:24.333
and that princess is you.

50:26.511 --> 50:28.011
- I'm no princess.

50:30.343 --> 50:34.159
I come from a fucked up broken home.

50:34.159 --> 50:37.027
My parents don't care about me.

50:37.027 --> 50:40.110
My friends are fake and self serving.

50:43.695 --> 50:46.695
I'm alone, for sure I'm no princess.

50:48.647 --> 50:51.647
- You are exactly as I imagined you.

50:54.754 --> 50:55.921
- I'm only 21.

50:57.079 --> 50:59.996
- My love your spirit and my spirit

51:01.486 --> 51:04.903
have known each other for over 200 years.

51:10.054 --> 51:11.887
I need you to help me.

51:13.326 --> 51:14.916
- How?

51:14.916 --> 51:18.223
- To get out from my current being

51:18.223 --> 51:21.887
I need two things to happen to me.

51:21.887 --> 51:23.220
- I'm listening.

51:26.456 --> 51:29.706
- When you love one you must sacrifice.

51:31.423 --> 51:34.173
(dramatic music)

51:35.282 --> 51:37.865
- I'm not sure I--
- Understand?

51:39.869 --> 51:41.536
Just think about it.

51:43.397 --> 51:46.064
(voice echoing)

52:04.542 --> 52:08.082
(chair banging down)

52:08.082 --> 52:10.159
- Why did you do that asshole?

52:10.159 --> 52:11.441
I was sleeping.

52:11.441 --> 52:14.334
- Yeah exactly, sleeping.

52:14.334 --> 52:16.496
No one sleeps on my watch babe.

52:16.496 --> 52:18.680
- You're drunk, and when you're drunk

52:18.680 --> 52:20.805
you're someone I don't want to know.

52:20.805 --> 52:22.406
- I'm not drunk.

52:22.406 --> 52:24.630
You know I don't like to be ignored.

52:24.630 --> 52:28.418
- I wasn't ignoring you, I was sleeping.

52:28.418 --> 52:30.501
Now I'm gonna ignore you.

52:31.703 --> 52:32.536
- Hey.

52:35.512 --> 52:36.345
Bitch.

52:37.538 --> 52:39.492
(door rattling)

52:39.492 --> 52:40.325
Nancy.

52:45.152 --> 52:48.688
Yeah go ahead and run,
I'll fucking find you.

52:48.688 --> 52:51.377
(eerie music)

52:51.377 --> 52:53.127
Need a fucking smoke.

53:03.167 --> 53:05.334
That was kind of exciting.

53:07.311 --> 53:09.561
(thudding)

53:10.854 --> 53:11.687
Fuck.

53:13.886 --> 53:15.580
(tense music)

53:15.580 --> 53:18.247
(door rattling)

53:19.267 --> 53:20.492
- I'm so glad to see you.
- Whoa, whoa.

53:20.492 --> 53:23.409
Nancy what's wrong?
- Where's Leila?

53:26.112 --> 53:28.922
- Leila, I left her back there.

53:28.922 --> 53:30.976
She's probably in the washroom.

53:30.976 --> 53:32.364
- I need to go home.

53:32.364 --> 53:34.697
David's too drunk to handle.

53:35.567 --> 53:37.405
- Give the guy some time, he'll sober up

53:37.405 --> 53:40.169
and he'll be the lover boy that he is.

53:40.169 --> 53:41.502
- Don't do that.

53:43.634 --> 53:44.720
- You kissed me first.

53:44.720 --> 53:47.720
- That was then, I'm in no mood now.

53:49.153 --> 53:52.320
- So you teased me?
- No, I'm no tease.

53:53.452 --> 53:54.389
- So kiss me.

53:54.389 --> 53:55.280
- I told you.

53:55.280 --> 53:56.697
- Nancy, kiss me.

53:59.422 --> 54:02.172
(dramatic music)

54:17.033 --> 54:19.200
- Not scared to sit alone?

54:25.309 --> 54:27.054
- Excuse me?

54:27.054 --> 54:28.590
- Aren't you scared to be alone?

54:28.590 --> 54:29.423
If I recall correctly you were

54:29.423 --> 54:31.973
the one shitting your pants an hour ago.

54:31.973 --> 54:33.855
- David I'm really in no mood--

54:33.855 --> 54:37.797
- Hey, hey, hey listen, I care about you.

54:37.797 --> 54:40.630
I care enough to want you don't I?

54:42.647 --> 54:44.471
Fucking women.

54:44.471 --> 54:46.779
Honestly I don't understand women.

54:46.779 --> 54:50.362
Look at you, you're
fucked, you are fucked.

54:51.415 --> 54:56.234
You're beautiful, you're sexy,
you're so god damn miserable.

54:56.234 --> 54:57.071
- You're mad.

54:57.071 --> 54:58.923
- I'm not mad.

54:58.923 --> 55:00.154
I just want you to be civilized with me,

55:00.154 --> 55:02.154
is that too much to ask?

55:04.473 --> 55:07.496
Hey don't walk away from me bitch.

55:07.496 --> 55:08.641
(groaning)

55:08.641 --> 55:10.095
(yelling)

55:10.095 --> 55:11.418
- [Leila] Get off of me.

55:11.418 --> 55:13.501
(crying)

55:22.479 --> 55:24.396
- [Dracula] Let her go.

55:25.654 --> 55:27.824
- Who the fuck are you?

55:27.824 --> 55:28.907
- Let her go.

55:29.940 --> 55:34.023
- [David] I didn't know
it was already Halloween.

55:36.354 --> 55:37.976
(whooshing)

55:37.976 --> 55:40.655
(thudding)

55:40.655 --> 55:43.155
(eerie music)

55:50.536 --> 55:53.369
(moaning echoing)

56:22.507 --> 56:23.507
- Fuck.
- No.

56:25.405 --> 56:28.322
- Come on baby where are you going?

56:32.688 --> 56:34.468
(laughing)

56:34.468 --> 56:36.724
Don't take it too hard
buddy, grab a drink.

56:36.724 --> 56:37.771
I'll catch up with you later.

56:37.771 --> 56:40.183
- You guys are weird friends.

56:40.183 --> 56:42.433
(laughing)

56:43.290 --> 56:44.123
- She's a good one eh?

56:44.123 --> 56:44.956
Fuck.

56:47.253 --> 56:49.676
She thinks we're fucking weird friends.

56:49.676 --> 56:52.448
Buddy if you ask me I think

56:52.448 --> 56:54.151
you guys are fucking weird lovers.

56:54.151 --> 56:56.716
(thumping)

56:56.716 --> 56:58.575
- [David] Fucking trash.

56:58.575 --> 57:01.795
You deserve more, I'll be back for you.

57:01.795 --> 57:04.295
(eerie music)

57:10.067 --> 57:13.235
- You can't deny your feeling.

57:13.235 --> 57:17.985
- The minute I walked in this
place I felt your presence.

57:20.715 --> 57:22.882
- I felt you too.
- Really?

57:25.097 --> 57:28.430
- I was in deep sleep for so many years.

57:29.570 --> 57:32.597
All my thoughts were in my dreams.

57:32.597 --> 57:34.621
- Did you know how I looked?

57:34.621 --> 57:36.371
- I dreamt about you.

57:37.782 --> 57:38.782
No one else.

57:40.261 --> 57:41.819
I had no doubts.

57:41.819 --> 57:43.402
- I'm here for you.

57:46.540 --> 57:48.123
How can I help you?

57:49.882 --> 57:51.965
- Two things you must do.

57:53.129 --> 57:56.993
Two things my lover must do to get me free

57:56.993 --> 57:58.955
and let me live again.

57:58.955 --> 58:02.718
- And then you'll be mine, no one else's?

58:02.718 --> 58:05.468
- You are my love and I am yours.

58:08.064 --> 58:10.231
It can't be any other way.

58:13.152 --> 58:17.096
- But since your time things have changed.

58:17.096 --> 58:20.214
- Don't worry my love you and I

58:20.214 --> 58:22.881
are made from the same material.

58:24.087 --> 58:25.837
They are not like us.

58:29.103 --> 58:31.770
- What can I do for you my love?

58:37.771 --> 58:39.688
- You are so beautiful.

58:45.123 --> 58:47.456
The first thing you must do,

58:49.592 --> 58:52.592
I need to drink the blood of others.

58:54.261 --> 58:57.094
And then you and I must make love.

59:03.013 --> 59:05.013
Then I'll be born again.

59:07.981 --> 59:10.363
- You're going to kill one of my friends

59:10.363 --> 59:11.887
and drink their blood?

59:11.887 --> 59:16.444
- Sweetie you're gonna
kill one of your friends.

59:16.444 --> 59:19.027
You must prove your love to me.

59:22.244 --> 59:25.411
I can kill anyone, but I gain nothing.

59:31.048 --> 59:34.007
It just can't be an accident.

59:34.007 --> 59:36.757
- Still that takes a lot of will.

59:37.596 --> 59:40.929
- Love without will is not much of love.

59:54.753 --> 59:58.253
- Then if that's what it takes I'll do it.

01:00:03.469 --> 01:00:06.886
- You are so courageous and a loyal mate.

01:00:08.298 --> 01:00:10.298
And I love you for that.

01:00:13.146 --> 01:00:15.896
(dramatic music)

01:00:32.097 --> 01:00:34.840
(panting)

01:00:34.840 --> 01:00:37.507
(door rattling)

01:00:43.387 --> 01:00:44.597
- Where the hell are you going?

01:00:44.597 --> 01:00:45.910
- I'm leaving.

01:00:45.910 --> 01:00:48.175
- Without me?
- We're finished.

01:00:48.175 --> 01:00:50.487
I don't want anything to do with you.

01:00:50.487 --> 01:00:52.223
- Simple, just like that?

01:00:52.223 --> 01:00:56.223
- No, it's been on my mind for a few days.

01:00:56.223 --> 01:00:57.393
- And you just made up your mind?

01:00:57.393 --> 01:01:00.476
- Tonight, tonight I made up my mind.

01:01:01.803 --> 01:01:02.745
- You had to fuck my best friend

01:01:02.745 --> 01:01:04.002
to make sure you wanted to leave me?

01:01:04.002 --> 01:01:07.752
- No, I wanted to free
myself from your grip.

01:01:11.379 --> 01:01:14.136
- Now show me how you're
gonna free yourself.

01:01:14.136 --> 01:01:16.029
(thumping)
(groaning)

01:01:16.029 --> 01:01:20.928
- I feel bad for hitting the
only thing I liked about you.

01:01:20.928 --> 01:01:22.873
(coughing)

01:01:22.873 --> 01:01:26.600
(suspenseful music)
(door rattling)

01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:29.350
Oh god. (crying)

01:01:45.833 --> 01:01:48.166
(thwacking)

01:01:58.440 --> 01:02:01.357
(unsettling music)

01:02:23.572 --> 01:02:24.739
- [David] Why?

01:02:28.341 --> 01:02:31.258
(unsettling music)

01:02:46.485 --> 01:02:49.735
(dramatic eerie music)

01:02:54.663 --> 01:02:56.413
- [Leila] Poor Nancy.

01:03:20.168 --> 01:03:22.418
- Where the fuck did he go?

01:03:23.429 --> 01:03:26.977
- Who you looking for?
(thumping)

01:03:26.977 --> 01:03:27.810
Punk, huh?

01:03:29.230 --> 01:03:31.470
- Fine, man we're even.

01:03:31.470 --> 01:03:32.303
- I'll fucking kick your ass

01:03:32.303 --> 01:03:34.491
until the fucking day
you regret hitting me.

01:03:34.491 --> 01:03:36.968
- Man I already regret it.

01:03:36.968 --> 01:03:38.824
- Yeah, why's that?

01:03:38.824 --> 01:03:41.526
- Something went wrong man.

01:03:41.526 --> 01:03:43.609
- [Nash] What went wrong?

01:03:44.760 --> 01:03:49.111
- I fucking got angry,
something went wrong.

01:03:49.111 --> 01:03:51.769
- [Nash] What happened?

01:03:51.769 --> 01:03:53.796
- Dude she's dead.

01:03:53.796 --> 01:03:54.879
- Who's dead?

01:03:55.812 --> 01:03:58.645
- Nancy, fucking Nancy's dead man.

01:04:01.488 --> 01:04:02.571
- She's dead?

01:04:04.481 --> 01:04:07.715
- We gotta figure out how to handle this.

01:04:07.715 --> 01:04:10.548
- Why, I'm not involved.

01:04:10.548 --> 01:04:11.815
- What you're gonna bail on me now?

01:04:11.815 --> 01:04:14.581
- If Nancy's fucking dead I
had nothing to do with it.

01:04:14.581 --> 01:04:18.914
- She's fucking dead and
you're as involved as I am.

01:04:27.005 --> 01:04:29.255
- Show me her fucking body.

01:04:30.455 --> 01:04:31.790
- Come on man.

01:04:31.790 --> 01:04:34.214
What you don't believe me?

01:04:34.214 --> 01:04:36.353
Fuck I wish I was lying.

01:04:36.353 --> 01:04:38.853
(eerie music)

01:04:49.238 --> 01:04:51.821
Man I left her body right here.

01:04:55.369 --> 01:04:57.944
- She just walked up to heaven.

01:04:57.944 --> 01:04:59.861
Fucking brilliant idea.

01:05:02.132 --> 01:05:03.609
- Well you don't believe me?

01:05:03.609 --> 01:05:04.442
Hey!

01:05:05.490 --> 01:05:08.157
That's Nancy's blood right here.

01:05:12.531 --> 01:05:14.796
It's that weird chick
Leila dude I swear to god.

01:05:14.796 --> 01:05:18.553
- What the fuck are you talking about?

01:05:18.553 --> 01:05:20.695
- We got a bigger problem now.

01:05:20.695 --> 01:05:22.524
We got a fucking witness.

01:05:22.524 --> 01:05:24.244
- Witness to what?

01:05:24.244 --> 01:05:25.563
- You gotta help me man.

01:05:25.563 --> 01:05:26.712
She can accuse you as much as she

01:05:26.712 --> 01:05:29.295
can accuse me of killing Nancy.

01:05:31.696 --> 01:05:33.283
We gotta find her.

01:05:33.283 --> 01:05:38.283
Then we'll figure out what
to do with her. (groaning)

01:05:39.046 --> 01:05:39.879
- Fuck.

01:05:40.764 --> 01:05:43.597
I don't need this shit, fuck this.

01:05:48.605 --> 01:05:49.938
- What the fuck?

01:06:00.031 --> 01:06:02.031
Maybe she's still alive.

01:06:19.635 --> 01:06:20.802
What the fuck?

01:06:24.261 --> 01:06:26.838
(gasping)

01:06:26.838 --> 01:06:31.838
(eerie music)
(blood drops dripping)

01:07:07.210 --> 01:07:08.370
- Fucking over it.

01:07:08.370 --> 01:07:09.885
Oh my god.

01:07:09.885 --> 01:07:11.069
There's no fucking way.

01:07:11.069 --> 01:07:11.902
No.

01:07:14.359 --> 01:07:17.492
- What the fuck is going on?

01:07:17.492 --> 01:07:20.197
- She's really fucking dead.

01:07:20.197 --> 01:07:22.541
What the fuck is going on?

01:07:22.541 --> 01:07:24.815
Oh my god dude that's fucking awful.

01:07:24.815 --> 01:07:27.285
What the fuck?
- Hey, hey.

01:07:27.285 --> 01:07:29.068
You need to get a fucking
hold of yourself man.

01:07:29.068 --> 01:07:32.306
- It's all your fucking fault.

01:07:32.306 --> 01:07:33.208
- If you wouldn't have fucked her

01:07:33.208 --> 01:07:35.625
this would've never happened.

01:07:37.812 --> 01:07:39.007
We gotta find her man.

01:07:39.007 --> 01:07:41.428
We gotta find Leila.

01:07:41.428 --> 01:07:44.511
We'll figure out what to do with her.

01:07:50.372 --> 01:07:54.455
- Why would Leila fucking
hang Nancy upside down?

01:07:55.564 --> 01:07:56.812
- Dude she's got a fucking vampire friend

01:07:56.812 --> 01:07:58.436
living with her in this place.

01:07:58.436 --> 01:08:01.489
I saw the fucker, he
already tried to kill me.

01:08:01.489 --> 01:08:02.964
- You serious?

01:08:02.964 --> 01:08:05.342
- Stop asking me if I'm
fucking serious man.

01:08:05.342 --> 01:08:06.842
I fucking saw him.

01:08:08.712 --> 01:08:10.348
We gotta find him.

01:08:10.348 --> 01:08:13.431
Tell the police that he killed Nancy.

01:08:14.304 --> 01:08:18.002
- That's if he doesn't
get to us fucking first.

01:08:18.002 --> 01:08:21.502
- Is there any fucking guns in this place?

01:08:22.640 --> 01:08:26.402
- There's a kitchen knife in the office.

01:08:26.402 --> 01:08:27.652
- Let's get it.

01:08:28.874 --> 01:08:33.791
I think I know where to fucking
find Leila and the vampire.

01:08:34.680 --> 01:08:37.180
(eerie music)

01:08:41.452 --> 01:08:42.952
- It's still dead.

01:08:43.807 --> 01:08:46.807
(thumping on table)

01:08:49.356 --> 01:08:51.273
Fuck, no reception man.

01:08:55.620 --> 01:08:59.120
- Man, all the warehouse doors are locked.

01:09:00.154 --> 01:09:02.084
- How do you know that?

01:09:02.084 --> 01:09:03.890
- Nancy was trying to get out.

01:09:03.890 --> 01:09:07.152
Every door she tried was locked.

01:09:07.152 --> 01:09:09.234
- Fuck this can't happen.

01:09:12.011 --> 01:09:14.261
(rattling)

01:09:19.907 --> 01:09:23.158
Fuck man, this can't save us man.

01:09:23.158 --> 01:09:24.158
- It has to.

01:09:25.698 --> 01:09:27.799
We gotta stick together through this shit.

01:09:27.799 --> 01:09:31.011
It's the only way we're gonna survive.

01:09:31.011 --> 01:09:33.429
- It's either us or them man.

01:09:35.341 --> 01:09:36.174
- It's us.

01:09:38.532 --> 01:09:41.203
- Let's fucking do this.

01:09:41.203 --> 01:09:44.453
(dramatic eerie music)

01:09:48.104 --> 01:09:51.354
- [Dracula] I love how your mind works.

01:09:54.597 --> 01:09:59.240
- Really, I don't know
what I want to do next.

01:09:59.240 --> 01:10:04.082
- [Dracula] Don't worry, your
heart will lead your mind.

01:10:04.082 --> 01:10:07.332
(dramatic eerie music)

01:10:13.810 --> 01:10:16.810
(suspenseful music)

01:10:19.634 --> 01:10:21.123
- Leila?

01:10:21.123 --> 01:10:24.764
We know you're hiding
here with your friend.

01:10:24.764 --> 01:10:27.764
We just want to talk to you sweetie.

01:10:34.299 --> 01:10:35.824
- We're all in trouble okay?

01:10:35.824 --> 01:10:36.702
Let's just talk this over

01:10:36.702 --> 01:10:39.869
and find a safe way out for all of us.

01:10:40.934 --> 01:10:44.226
- Yo, let's split up,
you got to the other end.

01:10:44.226 --> 01:10:45.393
- Eye contact.

01:10:54.061 --> 01:10:56.561
(eerie music)

01:11:05.754 --> 01:11:06.587
(electricity buzzing)

01:11:06.587 --> 01:11:09.296
(rock music on stereo)

01:11:09.296 --> 01:11:12.121
- Yo someone's in the security office.

01:11:12.121 --> 01:11:13.773
- I don't know how that can happen.

01:11:13.773 --> 01:11:16.569
It possibly turned on by remote control.

01:11:16.569 --> 01:11:18.037
- I think it's Leila.

01:11:18.037 --> 01:11:19.535
Yo I'm gonna check, you stay here.

01:11:19.535 --> 01:11:21.570
- Who the fuck are you
to tell me what to do?

01:11:21.570 --> 01:11:22.820
- Fine, you go.

01:11:23.966 --> 01:11:25.216
- Fine, you go.

01:11:28.509 --> 01:11:30.855
Fucking make me sick.

01:11:30.855 --> 01:11:33.938
(muffled rock music)

01:11:35.231 --> 01:11:36.064
Fuck.

01:11:36.938 --> 01:11:41.605
♪ You're high maintenance, just not fun ♪

01:11:48.600 --> 01:11:51.100
(eerie music)

01:12:33.334 --> 01:12:35.054
- [Leila] Are you looking for me?

01:12:35.054 --> 01:12:37.909
(voice echoing)

01:12:37.909 --> 01:12:40.409
(eerie music)

01:12:44.795 --> 01:12:46.381
- What the fuck?

01:12:46.381 --> 01:12:48.881
(eerie music)

01:12:58.781 --> 01:12:59.614
(whooshing)

01:12:59.614 --> 01:13:02.045
(groaning)

01:13:02.045 --> 01:13:04.545
(eerie music)

01:13:34.283 --> 01:13:35.616
- Where are you?

01:13:40.887 --> 01:13:44.149
(suspenseful music)

01:13:44.149 --> 01:13:46.066
What the fuck was that?

01:14:05.464 --> 01:14:07.063
(whooshing)
(gasping)

01:14:07.063 --> 01:14:09.313
(clanging)

01:14:12.806 --> 01:14:13.639
David!

01:14:16.103 --> 01:14:17.603
David!

01:14:17.603 --> 01:14:18.436
David!

01:14:22.368 --> 01:14:25.409
Please let me go, I've done you no wrong.

01:14:25.409 --> 01:14:27.690
- You've done me no wrong?

01:14:27.690 --> 01:14:28.940
- I was joking.

01:14:30.522 --> 01:14:32.527
I was high, I liked you.

01:14:32.527 --> 01:14:35.617
I wanted you to be my girlfriend.

01:14:35.617 --> 01:14:37.584
- Have you ever been in love?

01:14:37.584 --> 01:14:39.084
- Yeah sure, yeah.

01:14:42.448 --> 01:14:45.615
Not exactly okay, no, not yet, no, no.

01:14:47.332 --> 01:14:51.749
- Then you'll never understand
why I have to do this.

01:14:57.954 --> 01:15:00.841
(breathing heavy)

01:15:00.841 --> 01:15:01.924
- No, no, no!

01:15:04.291 --> 01:15:07.156
(blade slashing)

01:15:07.156 --> 01:15:09.656
(eerie music)

01:15:36.981 --> 01:15:40.481
(dramatic acoustic music)

01:16:25.320 --> 01:16:26.403
- I love you.

01:16:29.242 --> 01:16:30.325
- I love you.

01:16:31.842 --> 01:16:34.344
- I am yours forever.
