02:23.207 --> 02:26.577
"A big stick. Sometimes a metal chain."

02:26.677 --> 02:28.402
Where?

02:29.681 --> 02:30.915
"On the back."

02:31.315 --> 02:33.933
Is it bad? Does he bleed?

02:37.022 --> 02:38.254
"Sometimes."

02:40.524 --> 02:42.258
And it's his master who's doing this?

02:46.831 --> 02:50.633
It's okay. Tell him
I'm from <i>The New York Times.</i>

02:54.038 --> 02:58.907
I want to help you.
But I can't help you unless you help me.

03:00.110 --> 03:02.346
I think he wants, you know...

03:02.446 --> 03:04.880
I know what he wants.

03:08.753 --> 03:10.654
You see this?

03:10.754 --> 03:14.459
He can have this.
But only when we're done, okay?

03:17.395 --> 03:18.863
Again.

03:18.963 --> 03:22.333
Is it his master from the cocoa plantation
that's doing the beatings?

03:27.905 --> 03:29.907
"Yes."

03:31.909 --> 03:34.979
All right. And his parents are dead?

03:41.652 --> 03:44.822
"No." He says they live in the country.

03:44.922 --> 03:48.292
Okay, so it's... It's his parents
who are dead.

03:48.392 --> 03:50.595
Yes, I think so.

03:58.402 --> 04:00.037
Wait, wait, wait.

04:00.137 --> 04:02.641
Will you ask him to take his shirt off,
so I can see his back?

04:07.678 --> 04:10.681
Tell him we need to take
a picture for the paper.

04:13.467 --> 04:15.152
It's okay.

04:15.252 --> 04:17.288
This is me.

04:17.387 --> 04:20.257
Mike Finkel from <i>The New York Times.</i>

04:43.514 --> 04:45.549
Excuse me.

04:46.484 --> 04:49.754
- Do you speak English?
- A little.

04:50.541 --> 04:53.659
I can't figure this out.
This takes coins, right?

04:53.759 --> 04:56.762
I think so, yeah.

04:58.229 --> 05:00.731
- Ta-da.
- You did it.

05:03.100 --> 05:05.736
Why do they light candles?

05:05.836 --> 05:08.074
So people get to heaven?

05:09.574 --> 05:11.809
I'm not Catholic.

05:13.244 --> 05:16.780
- Are you German?
- Yeah.

05:18.115 --> 05:20.651
What brings you to Mexico?

05:20.751 --> 05:23.521
Some winter sun.

05:23.621 --> 05:25.857
Oh, yeah.

05:28.258 --> 05:30.260
You?

05:35.900 --> 05:38.268
I'm a journalist.

05:38.569 --> 05:41.805
Journalist? Cool.

05:41.905 --> 05:46.177
Yeah. Whatever. It's just a job.

05:46.277 --> 05:49.580
What is your name then, Mr. Journalist?

05:50.080 --> 05:51.349
Me?

05:51.449 --> 05:56.086
Mike Finkel, with <i>The New York Times.</i>

05:56.186 --> 05:59.390
- Lena. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

06:45.853 --> 06:47.689
Ten minutes, Mike.
We gotta put this thing to bed.

06:47.939 --> 06:50.384
I'm on it. Raise $250.

06:50.484 --> 06:52.527
- You serious?
- You heard me. $250.

06:52.627 --> 06:53.829
Motherfucker.

06:53.929 --> 06:55.513
So how long are you back for, Mike?

06:55.613 --> 06:59.184
Just tonight. I just came back to make sure
they didn't sub the shit out of me again.

06:59.284 --> 07:00.735
Where do they put me?
The fucking Hilton.

07:00.835 --> 07:03.221
- Nice.
- Yeah. It's a circus out there.

07:03.321 --> 07:04.423
- Call.
- Yeah.

07:04.523 --> 07:07.418
You know, when I arrived, at the same hotel
as me, a guy from Reuters,

07:07.518 --> 07:09.844
two from Le Monde,
and that Kwiatowski from <i>CNN.</i>

07:09.944 --> 07:12.212
- Turn. Ace of spades.
- Hello.

07:12.312 --> 07:14.281
- $500.
- Bullshit.

07:14.381 --> 07:15.833
- Mike?
- I'm on it.

07:15.933 --> 07:18.269
- It'll need proofing.
- No, it won't.

07:18.369 --> 07:19.670
The whole thing stinks.

07:19.770 --> 07:22.524
You know, people are starving
on the coast and 200 miles inland,

07:22.624 --> 07:24.543
it's all Bon Jovi and French fries.

07:24.643 --> 07:26.355
But what do they care?
As far as they're concerned,

07:26.455 --> 07:28.612
they're getting a cigar box
from Gaddafi at Christmas.

07:28.712 --> 07:32.483
You know what I want for Christmas?
6,000 words.

07:32.583 --> 07:34.606
Are we playing poker, or what?

07:34.706 --> 07:35.820
King of spades.

07:35.920 --> 07:37.855
Here, pussy, pussy, pussy, pussy, pussy.

07:37.955 --> 07:41.225
- $750.
- He's got the fucking Jack.

07:41.625 --> 07:43.929
- I'm out.
- We all ready to drink this town?

07:44.229 --> 07:47.464
Come on, Mike, show us.
You got those Jacks, or what?

07:47.898 --> 07:49.967
He doesn't have to. You folded.

07:50.067 --> 07:53.203
Come on, asshole, show us.

07:53.303 --> 07:55.339
Me?

07:56.206 --> 07:59.461
- I don't have shit. A pair of deuces.
- Oh, my...

07:59.561 --> 08:01.526
Really?

08:01.626 --> 08:03.982
Can someone help me scoop up
all this money I just won?

08:04.082 --> 08:05.817
You're paying for drinks tonight.

08:19.997 --> 08:21.666
Mom.

08:21.766 --> 08:25.136
<i>This is 42nd Street, with transfers
to the ACE and E train.</i>

08:25.236 --> 08:28.071
<i>Stay clear of the closing doors.</i>

08:28.672 --> 08:30.041
<i>So did you read it?</i>

08:30.141 --> 08:33.311
<i>Read it? What do you think?
I'm framing it now.</i>

08:33.410 --> 08:35.947
Seriously. You don't have to do that.

08:36.047 --> 08:37.682
<i>What? I'm, like, your biggest fan.</i>

08:37.782 --> 08:41.019
<i>Mike, that's nine covers in three years.</i>

08:41.119 --> 08:45.023
- Ten, but who's counting?
- <i>Nine, ten, whatever.</i>

08:45.123 --> 08:47.224
<i>You going to give yourself
a day off now?</i>

08:47.324 --> 08:50.227
No, I'm actually going into the office.
Marcus and Karen want to see me.

08:50.327 --> 08:52.696
<i>Really? What about?</i>

08:52.796 --> 08:55.433
No idea, but I have a hunch
it rhymes with Smulitzer.

08:55.533 --> 08:59.204
- <i>I wish I was there to celebrate with you.</i>
- If you lived here, you would be.

08:59.304 --> 09:02.206
<i>You know I can't. Come home soon.</i>

09:02.306 --> 09:06.051
- I will. I love you.
- <i>I love you, too.</i>

09:08.879 --> 09:10.749
- What's up, man?
- My dude.

09:10.849 --> 09:12.208
Hey.

09:17.421 --> 09:19.990
- Hey.
- Hey.

09:20.090 --> 09:22.293
Listen, I don't want
to bother you with this,

09:22.393 --> 09:26.292
but Marcus got a call from Save
the Children about that article of yours.

09:26.392 --> 09:28.799
The cocoa plantation piece.

09:28.899 --> 09:32.203
They say that's not
Youssouf Male on the cover.

09:32.303 --> 09:34.205
This is.

09:34.505 --> 09:36.674
I can't remember.
I interviewed both of them.

09:36.774 --> 09:38.909
They wrong?

09:39.009 --> 09:40.444
They must be.

09:40.544 --> 09:43.414
Hey, these things happen all the time.
Let's go tell him.

09:43.814 --> 09:46.450
- Sure.
- You better bring your old notebooks.

09:46.750 --> 09:49.104
They've also taken issue
with some of the content.

09:49.204 --> 09:52.490
It's all checkable.
None of it should be a problem.

09:52.590 --> 09:54.592
Fifteen minutes?

09:55.315 --> 09:57.194
Sure.

09:59.096 --> 10:01.665
Is this him or not?

10:02.933 --> 10:05.770
Everything I wrote about Male
happened to at least one of the boys.

10:07.237 --> 10:11.141
Is this or is this not Youssouf Male?

10:11.241 --> 10:14.211
This boy with scars
like a mountain range.

10:14.311 --> 10:15.980
Yes, it is.

10:16.080 --> 10:19.082
- You sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

10:19.750 --> 10:24.087
Okay, great. So just show us
where his details are in here.

10:30.828 --> 10:33.764
- I can't do that.
- Why not?

10:33.864 --> 10:36.600
Because I didn't take notes that day.

10:36.900 --> 10:39.536
It might not be him?

10:45.743 --> 10:48.812
This article was about saving
young people's lives.

10:48.912 --> 10:50.949
I wanted to write about
all the kids I interviewed.

10:51.049 --> 10:52.319
I came back with a plan for that.

10:52.619 --> 10:56.421
A more aggressive story about
the corruption within these aid agencies.

10:56.521 --> 10:58.289
But we felt it was too broad.

10:58.389 --> 11:01.026
Don't imply this has anything to do
with anyone other than you, Mike.

11:01.126 --> 11:02.610
You said write about one boy.

11:02.710 --> 11:06.131
Suggest the issues through one boy's
story. A personal portrait.

11:06.231 --> 11:08.032
And you were right.
You were absolutely right.

11:08.132 --> 11:09.700
I assumed you had the research.

11:09.800 --> 11:13.013
- I did, just not all in one place.
- Then that's not research.

11:13.113 --> 11:15.840
Mike, you must understand
how damaging this could be

11:15.940 --> 11:17.908
for the charities
who work with these children.

11:18.008 --> 11:20.612
- Not to mention the paper.
- You said write it up.

11:20.712 --> 11:23.181
I... I thought it could work
on a higher level.

11:23.281 --> 11:27.085
I said write it up, not make it up.
The higher level is the truth.

11:27.185 --> 11:31.521
You didn't have the research,
that's the only fact that matters here.

11:31.621 --> 11:33.624
Do you think this stuff writes itself?

11:33.724 --> 11:38.362
You hire people like me
to get on the ground and hunt.

11:38.462 --> 11:41.231
That's how this paper
has competitive advantage.

11:41.331 --> 11:44.769
- I did the best with what I had.
- You lied.

11:45.469 --> 11:46.904
I just can't understand why.

11:47.004 --> 11:49.708
It's not like you had anything
to prove to any of us,

11:49.808 --> 11:53.187
you're an exceptional journalist.
It just bewilders me.

11:53.287 --> 11:55.446
We'll have to be open
with our readers about this, Mike,

11:55.546 --> 11:58.253
which is no small embarrassment.
Explain what you've done.

11:58.353 --> 12:00.884
Do you know what that means
for those poor kids?

12:00.984 --> 12:05.457
For the support your article gave them,
for their futures? For your future?

12:05.557 --> 12:09.559
- What the fuck were you thinking?
- Okay, that's enough, Karen.

12:12.896 --> 12:16.032
All right. I...

12:16.500 --> 12:19.504
I can write a retraction,
if that's what you want.

12:19.604 --> 12:22.039
That's what I can do.
I can go... I'll go right now.

12:22.139 --> 12:25.310
I'll go and I'll just
write you a retraction,

12:25.410 --> 12:28.011
if that's what you want, okay?

12:36.753 --> 12:41.358
Just... can you not print the apology?

12:43.794 --> 12:46.097
If you print the apology,
no one will touch me.

12:46.197 --> 12:49.600
Can you just... Can you do that?
Can you just not print the apology?

12:49.900 --> 12:52.452
Just that, please?

12:54.538 --> 12:58.241
You have a great future
ahead of you, Mike.

12:58.341 --> 13:00.777
But not here.

13:56.332 --> 13:59.136
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
this is your captain speaking.</i>

13:59.236 --> 14:02.072
<i>We're about to begin our descent
into Bozeman, Montana.</i>

14:02.172 --> 14:06.077
<i>For those of you returning,
we would like to welcome you home.</i>

14:06.177 --> 14:10.580
<i>For those passengers visiting Montana
for the first time...</i>

14:28.598 --> 14:31.468
I can be working again by summer.

14:31.601 --> 14:34.337
If I can find something good.

14:36.873 --> 14:41.378
I can ask the university
for a raise, or...

14:41.478 --> 14:45.882
- take on some high school teaching.
- No, I'll make some calls.

14:49.186 --> 14:52.296
It'll be nice to have you
back for a while.

15:28.805 --> 15:30.861
Tonya, it's Mike.

15:30.961 --> 15:33.363
Finkel. Yeah.

15:33.463 --> 15:35.265
I know, it's been a long time.

15:35.365 --> 15:38.870
<i>Anyway, listen, I have this great idea.
It's a snowboarding piece.</i>

15:38.970 --> 15:43.305
<i>I'm going to shoot with my war photographer,
Chris, so it's going to look like...</i>

15:43.405 --> 15:44.976
<i>But this is... This is winter sports.</i>

15:45.076 --> 15:47.712
<i>This doesn't have anything
to do with what happened.</i>

15:47.812 --> 15:50.313
<i>Hi, Ed, it's Mike Finkel.</i>

15:50.914 --> 15:53.283
Since the A.P. awards dinner, yes.

15:53.783 --> 15:56.091
<i>So, listen, Ed, I have this thing
I've been working up</i>

15:56.191 --> 15:58.656
<i>on black ops in the Marine Corps
from my war days.</i>

15:58.756 --> 16:02.492
And it feels like a <i>GQ </i> piece.

16:02.592 --> 16:05.929
Right, but none of my other work
has any suspicion.

16:06.229 --> 16:09.032
<i>How long have we known each other?
Don't make me beg here.</i>

16:09.132 --> 16:11.318
<i>Right, but it's 11:30.</i>

16:11.418 --> 16:15.406
<i>I know he can't be at lunch because</i>
Playboy <i>doesn't even open until 11:00.</i>

16:15.506 --> 16:17.358
I understand.

16:17.458 --> 16:19.442
Okay.

16:23.146 --> 16:24.799
Hey.

16:24.899 --> 16:28.866
Hang on, hang on. Here.

16:29.887 --> 16:31.489
Hey, it's okay.

16:31.589 --> 16:36.026
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

16:36.126 --> 16:38.695
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

16:53.609 --> 16:56.180
- Hello?
- <i>Hi, my name is Pat Frato.</i>

16:56.280 --> 16:57.715
<i>I'm a reporter with The Oregonian.</i>

16:57.815 --> 17:00.151
<i>Oh, I'm sure you're buried
in all this by now,</i>

17:00.251 --> 17:04.186
<i>but I wanted to get your side
on the Christian Longo story.</i>

17:04.287 --> 17:07.958
- Who?
- <i>Christian Longo? The child killer?</i>

17:08.058 --> 17:12.130
<i>He murdered his entire family out here
in Newport. You must know about him.</i>

17:12.230 --> 17:15.398
<i>They finally took him down in Cancun
last week. You hadn't heard?</i>

17:15.499 --> 17:18.301
No. Why are you telling me this?

17:18.602 --> 17:23.106
<i>Because when they apprehended him,
he said he was Mike Finkel,</i>

17:23.205 --> 17:25.775
<i>of </i> The New York Times.

17:26.910 --> 17:28.978
<i>Hello?</i>

17:29.779 --> 17:32.766
<i>Hello? Mr. Finkel?</i>

17:33.316 --> 17:36.453
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Hold on one second.

17:59.976 --> 18:02.379
When they picked him up in Mexico,
he denied all knowledge of it,

18:02.479 --> 18:05.415
but the cops clearly felt
they had enough to bring him in.

18:05.815 --> 18:10.221
He was just a regular guy, an intelligent,
sane man from a good family.

18:10.321 --> 18:14.325
Comes home one night and kills
his wife and kids. It makes no sense.

18:14.425 --> 18:17.694
At any rate, this turned out to be
the end of the line for them.

18:17.994 --> 18:20.130
He... He drowned them.

18:20.230 --> 18:25.268
Although there is evidence to suggest
that his wife and baby were strangled first.

18:25.368 --> 18:28.239
- Where are they holding him now?
- Lincoln County Jail.

18:28.739 --> 18:31.909
He'll stay there until it comes
to trial, I suspect.

18:33.943 --> 18:37.515
I'm going to have to start getting back.
I'm afraid it's quite a drive.

18:37.615 --> 18:39.416
But you can keep all of this.

18:39.516 --> 18:41.452
Thank you so much, Pat.
I really appreciate...

18:41.552 --> 18:47.089
No, I wanted to meet you as much
as you me. I love your writing.

18:49.992 --> 18:53.984
Hey, listen. Did he say anything at all
about why he claimed to be me?

18:54.084 --> 18:56.551
I'd hoped you might
be able to tell me that.

18:56.651 --> 19:00.023
Just one for your diaries, I guess.

19:01.003 --> 19:03.539
- Thanks a lot.
- Yeah.

19:18.054 --> 19:19.629
<i>Dear Mr. Longo:</i>

19:19.729 --> 19:23.093
<i>This is Michael Finkel.
I am told you've been using my name.</i>

19:23.193 --> 19:26.696
<i>I can't say I understand why,
as I don't recall us ever meeting.</i>

19:26.796 --> 19:28.571
<i>But, actually, I don't mind.</i>

19:28.671 --> 19:31.553
<i>In fact, in a way, it makes me
feel kind of honored.</i>

19:31.653 --> 19:33.970
<i>I know you are facing an upcoming trial
and have been instructed</i>

19:34.070 --> 19:38.341
<i>to avoid people like me, but I was wondering
whether you would agree to meet.</i>

19:38.441 --> 19:41.778
<i>You see, I've been through
a kind of trial myself.</i>

19:41.878 --> 19:44.715
<i>And at the very same time
that you were using my name,</i>

19:44.815 --> 19:47.183
<i>they stripped me of it.</i>

19:47.917 --> 19:49.988
<i>Since then, I've been doing
a lot of soul searching.</i>

19:50.088 --> 19:52.622
<i>I've been trying to find out
who I really am.</i>

19:52.772 --> 19:56.793
<i>I thought maybe you could tell me
what it's like to be me.</i>

20:07.837 --> 20:11.274
You get 15 minutes. Guard will be
in attendance the whole time.

20:11.974 --> 20:15.379
<i>No physical contact during any part
of the meeting, understood?</i>

20:16.179 --> 20:17.814
He'll... He'll be in the room with me?

20:18.214 --> 20:20.651
<i>Lincoln County doesn't get
many cases like this,</i>

20:20.751 --> 20:22.653
<i>so he gets the only room we've got.</i>

20:22.753 --> 20:25.655
<i>I just thought because he's accused
of multiple homicide...</i>

20:25.755 --> 20:28.993
<i>Visiting privileges are determined
by your behavior in here,</i>

20:29.093 --> 20:30.860
<i>not your crimes out there.</i>

20:30.960 --> 20:35.565
- <i>And how's his behavior been?</i>
- <i>Longo? Exemplary.</i>

21:00.590 --> 21:03.593
Thank you for seeing me, Mr. Longo.

21:09.299 --> 21:11.534
Call me Chris.

21:11.634 --> 21:15.672
- Nice to meet you, Chris.
- Yeah, nice to meet you, too.

21:17.974 --> 21:20.343
What are you writing?

21:21.511 --> 21:24.081
Sorry. It's... It's a habit.

21:25.748 --> 21:27.984
First impressions?

21:28.651 --> 21:31.121
Yes, first impressions.

21:32.021 --> 21:33.699
What did you put down?

21:35.425 --> 21:37.263
Brown eyes.

21:39.896 --> 21:42.599
That's not very remarkable.

21:42.699 --> 21:45.835
I'm sure 70% of the world
has brown eyes.

21:45.935 --> 21:48.571
I guess so. I don't.

21:49.807 --> 21:52.108
You know, there's a...

21:52.208 --> 21:55.112
mathematical technique
that will determine

21:55.212 --> 21:57.780
how ordinary a person you are.

21:57.880 --> 22:00.118
Not just your looks,
but your whole life.

22:00.218 --> 22:02.890
- Really?
- From my calculations, I'd say...

22:02.990 --> 22:05.488
I'm pretty ordinary.

22:05.588 --> 22:09.359
I've been decent and regular for...

22:09.459 --> 22:12.562
92.88% of the time.

22:13.062 --> 22:16.332
But you couldn't tell that
from reading the papers.

22:16.466 --> 22:19.335
They write about me and...

22:20.203 --> 22:23.640
- I'm just another...
- Pariah.

22:24.240 --> 22:26.593
Yeah. Exactly.

22:30.747 --> 22:32.716
So why... why me?

22:33.216 --> 22:35.920
Picked up <i>The Times</i> and you thought
the name sounded funny?

22:36.020 --> 22:39.589
No, I... I've followed
your whole career.

22:39.689 --> 22:40.558
What?

22:40.658 --> 22:43.110
I've always found
your writing appealing.

22:43.210 --> 22:45.128
The adventure.

22:45.228 --> 22:48.998
The way you stand up for people
that don't have voices.

22:49.098 --> 22:51.502
I've probably read everything
you've done.

22:51.602 --> 22:53.770
I guess I felt like I knew you.

22:56.506 --> 22:59.508
So I read the paper.

23:00.777 --> 23:03.012
Did you do it?

23:05.315 --> 23:07.684
I should be asking you the same thing.

23:10.887 --> 23:13.689
I'm gonna take that as a yes.

23:15.658 --> 23:17.390
Why?

23:20.530 --> 23:22.899
I don't know.

23:24.000 --> 23:28.504
You know... I needed the story
to be ahead of the game.

23:31.908 --> 23:34.034
But deep down, you know, I don't know.

23:36.512 --> 23:38.085
And now you're here.

23:41.684 --> 23:43.753
Well...

23:44.654 --> 23:48.357
All the networks
have been chasing me, and...

23:48.725 --> 23:53.289
I've had a bunch of requests
from different newspapers.

23:54.564 --> 23:58.101
- <i>The Times?</i>
- Not yet.

23:58.201 --> 24:00.920
I know I'm very valuable
to people like you.

24:01.020 --> 24:04.190
And not everything's been said yet.

24:04.540 --> 24:06.943
But most journalists

24:07.043 --> 24:09.746
they're only interested in writing
what their readers want to hear.

24:09.846 --> 24:11.705
They don't want to take the time

24:11.805 --> 24:15.918
to find out the truth
about what really happened.

24:16.886 --> 24:19.108
But maybe at this point,
it doesn't matter.

24:19.208 --> 24:22.826
Of course it matters.
The truth always matters.

24:22.926 --> 24:25.941
It always seems to matter to you.

24:27.096 --> 24:29.932
You know, when I was being you,

24:30.633 --> 24:34.137
it was the happiest
I'd been in a long time.

24:35.338 --> 24:39.241
Do you think you could
ever imagine being me?

24:40.009 --> 24:43.079
Longo! Time to go.

24:43.546 --> 24:46.215
Okay. Mike.

24:46.883 --> 24:50.753
I want to tell you my side of this.
Only you.

24:50.853 --> 24:52.767
But I know that eventually
you're gonna want to write about it,

24:52.867 --> 24:55.892
so I'm gonna need two things
from you in return.

24:55.992 --> 24:57.594
What?

24:57.694 --> 24:59.896
I need your word

24:59.996 --> 25:04.167
that you will not tell anyone
what I tell you until after the trial.

25:04.267 --> 25:06.803
And in return,

25:06.903 --> 25:09.939
I will grant you exclusive access.

25:10.039 --> 25:12.542
- Okay?
- I promise.

25:13.242 --> 25:15.801
But if I write about you,
you may not like what you read.

25:15.901 --> 25:18.114
I understand.

25:19.248 --> 25:21.851
What's the second thing?

25:25.488 --> 25:28.124
I want you to teach me to write.

25:34.964 --> 25:37.104
- This him?
- Yeah.

25:42.305 --> 25:44.574
You might not even hear from him again.

25:44.674 --> 25:46.709
I will.

25:47.910 --> 25:51.047
- I think he trusts me.
- Can you trust him?

25:51.447 --> 25:53.383
- Don't do that.
- What?

25:53.483 --> 25:56.586
You think after what happened,
I didn't cross-check the police reports?

25:56.686 --> 26:00.012
This is a once-in-a-lifetime story.

26:02.191 --> 26:05.061
Don't you see this as a second chance?

26:42.665 --> 26:44.616
<i>Dear Mike:</i>

26:44.716 --> 26:45.903
<i>Write what you know?</i>

26:46.003 --> 26:50.608
<i>Well, here is a list of all the ways
I've gone wrong through life,</i>

26:50.708 --> 26:55.045
<i>so I may better understand how I reached
this path I now find myself on.</i>

26:55.145 --> 26:58.748
<i>My father was a strict man.
I once stole a roll of quarters from...</i>

26:58.848 --> 27:02.419
<i>We married pretty young and I definitely
struggled for work at first.</i>

27:02.519 --> 27:04.021
<i>And eventually, because
they liked what I was doing,</i>

27:04.121 --> 27:07.550
<i>they put me on the executive fast track.
I also made a few stupid decisions</i>

27:07.650 --> 27:10.093
<i>about what we spent our money on.
We traveled a lot...</i>

27:10.193 --> 27:13.062
<i>The children came
like a flock of starlings.</i>

27:13.162 --> 27:17.100
<i>No one tells you how hard
it's gonna be when you have kids.</i>

27:17.200 --> 27:20.971
<i>Providing for them was all I sought to do.
You just get through it. No matter what.</i>

27:21.071 --> 27:23.006
<i>These were the boom years in America.</i>

27:23.106 --> 27:25.645
<i>No matter where we traveled,
I could never find enough</i>

27:25.745 --> 27:28.212
<i>to give them all
what they truly deserved.</i>

27:28.312 --> 27:30.213
<i>We had to forfeit all our property.</i>

27:30.613 --> 27:35.651
<i>We went from Ohio all the way
to Oregon. Motels, takeout.</i>

27:35.751 --> 27:38.591
<i>Being brought up a Jehovah's Witness
was a blessing in my life,</i>

27:38.691 --> 27:40.390
<i>because it was there I met my wife.</i>

27:40.490 --> 27:42.326
<i>For two months, we had to sleep
in the warehouse.</i>

27:42.426 --> 27:46.011
<i>We went on the run.
Shame is a terrible emotion for a man.</i>

27:46.111 --> 27:48.231
<i>To lose your dignity in front
of your wife and children...</i>

27:48.331 --> 27:51.769
<i>I took any work I could find.
I spent four months in Starbucks,</i>

27:51.869 --> 27:54.872
<i>making coffee for kids and guys
who used to work for me.</i>

27:55.372 --> 27:59.676
<i>The car we had broke down,
so I just drove off the lot.</i>

27:59.776 --> 28:02.813
<i>All my friends were going to college.</i>

28:02.913 --> 28:05.081
<i>We were teaching our kids how to walk.</i>

28:05.181 --> 28:09.253
<i>I wish I could have gone to college.
It felt so good just to make M.J. happy.</i>

28:09.353 --> 28:12.672
<i>When I think back to my life
before that awful night,</i>

28:12.772 --> 28:14.908
<i>it's like looking at a watercolor.</i>

28:15.158 --> 28:19.095
<i>The outlines are clear,
but they fade at the edges</i>

28:19.595 --> 28:22.498
<i>leaving blurs and smudges.</i>

28:22.598 --> 28:25.301
<i>Everything after that...</i>

28:25.901 --> 28:27.970
<i>is dark.</i>

29:11.013 --> 29:14.016
- How long are you going for?
- A couple days.

29:16.986 --> 29:20.022
- What was her name?
- The wife?

29:20.890 --> 29:23.692
- MaryJane.
- And the baby?

29:23.792 --> 29:25.795
Madison.

29:26.729 --> 29:29.231
How old was she?

29:30.099 --> 29:32.501
She was three years old.

29:33.202 --> 29:36.772
- Look, I know what I'm doing, okay?
- I know.

29:39.808 --> 29:43.763
- Take care.
- I'll call you, all right?

29:44.013 --> 29:46.015
Love you.

30:04.700 --> 30:06.402
So this is it?

30:06.502 --> 30:09.940
- Second floor, the one on the left.
- Can we see it?

30:10.040 --> 30:12.409
Well, it's totally empty,
the cops cleared it out.

30:12.509 --> 30:14.244
But I can show you
where they were found.

30:15.044 --> 30:17.680
According to the coroner,
MaryJane and Madison

30:17.780 --> 30:22.386
were beaten and strangled to death,
and then zipped inside two suitcases

30:22.486 --> 30:25.255
with free weights and dropped here,

30:25.355 --> 30:29.626
breaking a water pipe on the way down,
which is noticed the next morning

30:29.726 --> 30:33.230
and becomes part of the reason the canal
was searched the following week.

30:34.330 --> 30:38.000
- It's pretty public here.
- I know. Crazy.

30:38.100 --> 30:41.171
And then Zach and Sadie
are driven 15 miles south

30:41.271 --> 30:44.707
and dropped in the water
at Waldport, over there.

30:44.807 --> 30:48.379
Why drive 15 miles to dump bodies
on the edge of the next town?

30:48.479 --> 30:50.631
Don't you find that odd?

30:50.731 --> 30:52.815
Maybe something in him
wanted to get caught.

30:52.915 --> 30:56.152
- Then why'd flee?
- I guess he changed his mind.

30:56.252 --> 30:58.354
So this is where he dropped them.

30:58.454 --> 31:02.024
It's not high enough to kill them outright,
so they would have drowned.

31:02.124 --> 31:04.594
Unless the cold made them
go into cardiac arrest.

31:04.694 --> 31:08.164
It was well below zero that night.

31:08.864 --> 31:12.735
- Terrible thing for him to do.
- If he did it.

31:12.835 --> 31:16.372
- If?
- He's gonna plead innocent.

31:16.472 --> 31:18.941
How do you know?

31:19.041 --> 31:22.144
- He told me.
- You spoke to him?

31:22.244 --> 31:25.514
- I met him.
- Why?

31:25.648 --> 31:27.851
I wanted to hear his side of the story.

31:29.518 --> 31:33.290
I'm not sure Christian Longo
deserves to have his story heard.

31:36.192 --> 31:38.662
Everybody deserves
to have their story heard.

31:44.033 --> 31:46.035
Mommy!

32:11.760 --> 32:13.395
<i>I know you did it.</i>

32:13.495 --> 32:16.031
<i>You know you did it.</i>

32:17.066 --> 32:20.263
<i>We don't need the how or why,
just three little words.</i>

32:20.363 --> 32:22.251
<i>They can be spoken real quick.</i>

32:26.976 --> 32:29.511
<i>I just can't right now.</i>

32:29.611 --> 32:31.647
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

32:45.101 --> 32:48.330
Chris, your letter
was an extraordinary thing.

32:49.131 --> 32:52.668
But this story between
the two of us, it's...

32:52.768 --> 32:54.774
it's not an article I can write.

32:58.457 --> 33:00.959
But it could be a book.

33:01.477 --> 33:02.512
Really?

33:02.612 --> 33:05.615
But if we're gonna write
something like that together,

33:05.715 --> 33:08.818
it's what you tell me,
not how, that's important.

33:09.618 --> 33:12.421
I know. It's just that...

33:12.521 --> 33:16.258
you speak so beautifully,
you have such a mastery of words,

33:16.358 --> 33:18.761
and I want that.

33:19.161 --> 33:23.765
It inspires me. I... I need it.

33:25.301 --> 33:27.436
Okay.

33:27.536 --> 33:29.805
Let's make a trade.

33:29.905 --> 33:32.242
I give you a note,
you answer a question.

33:36.545 --> 33:39.758
- Okay.
- All right.

33:41.050 --> 33:42.983
All right, so on page 23 you write,

33:43.083 --> 33:46.523
"When I lost my position at the realtor's,
MaryJane thought I'd tried to get fired,

33:46.623 --> 33:49.292
"but I never said it was
a job I didn't want."

33:49.392 --> 33:52.717
So that's a double negative,
"never said I didn't want."

33:54.996 --> 33:58.367
- Okay.
- It's weak, a double negative.

33:58.467 --> 34:01.471
In good journalism, we would write,
"It was a job I wanted."

34:02.071 --> 34:05.475
I get it. Two negatives
don't make a positive.

34:05.575 --> 34:07.610
Okay.

34:08.377 --> 34:10.612
My turn.

34:12.181 --> 34:14.150
Okay.

34:14.250 --> 34:17.820
Why did you hook up
with that German girl in Mexico?

34:24.960 --> 34:28.541
- How'd you know about that?
- I spoke to her.

34:31.100 --> 34:33.435
I don't know.

34:35.237 --> 34:40.275
I was... I was grieving so much,

34:40.376 --> 34:45.514
it was as if the old
Chris Longo was dead.

34:46.681 --> 34:48.952
But you slept with her
on the first night.

34:51.353 --> 34:53.255
I don't know.

34:53.355 --> 34:55.858
That's what she says.

34:56.225 --> 35:00.662
Chris, did you do
what you're accused of doing?

35:16.745 --> 35:19.948
I loved my family.

35:21.884 --> 35:25.487
I only wanted what was best for them.

35:32.394 --> 35:35.531
I'm really sorry, Mike.
I can't do this right now.

35:35.631 --> 35:37.766
Do what?

35:40.502 --> 35:42.939
I can't tell you what really happened.

35:46.108 --> 35:48.144
Okay.

35:50.446 --> 35:52.314
Okay. Then...

35:52.414 --> 35:56.085
Then why flee to Mexico
right after they were found?

35:56.185 --> 36:00.072
I mean, you have to understand,
that makes you look incredibly guilty.

36:00.656 --> 36:02.658
Sometimes,

36:04.259 --> 36:07.863
you have to accept looking one way...

36:07.963 --> 36:11.456
in order to protect something
more important.

36:12.634 --> 36:17.189
Chris, if you're hiding something
from me, I will find out.

36:17.289 --> 36:21.210
That's what I do. I look everywhere.

36:30.686 --> 36:33.121
Why did you kill them?

36:45.434 --> 36:47.252
I didn't kill them.

37:45.527 --> 37:48.380
<i>It's part true crime,
but it's part </i> mea culpa.

37:48.480 --> 37:49.999
It's really about writing itself.

37:50.099 --> 37:52.002
<i>And you're sure it's a full book
and not an article?</i>

37:52.102 --> 37:55.239
- <i>You really feel that there's enough there?</i>
- It's a book, it is a book.

37:55.839 --> 37:58.464
<i>We're not gonna find out later
it's like the African story?</i>

37:58.564 --> 38:01.543
<i>You can imagine how difficult
that would be for us.</i>

38:02.077 --> 38:05.814
Of course, of course. And I...

38:06.515 --> 38:08.450
You have nothing to worry about.

38:08.750 --> 38:11.454
It all came at once,
and I had five mouths to feed,

38:11.554 --> 38:15.491
- so I took any job I could get.
- That was when you started stealing?

38:18.293 --> 38:20.596
You know about that?

38:20.696 --> 38:24.936
It was just small amounts.
Food and clothes, and diapers.

38:25.036 --> 38:26.928
Books.

38:27.028 --> 38:28.654
That...

38:28.754 --> 38:30.974
teddy bear they found with Madison,

38:31.074 --> 38:34.426
with her body.
That was originally Zach's.

38:34.526 --> 38:38.430
And it was handed down to Sadie
and then to Madison.

38:38.580 --> 38:42.217
All because I couldn't buy new toys.

38:42.718 --> 38:45.854
I mean, what kind of loser can't even...

38:45.954 --> 38:48.557
That says more about you than anything.

38:49.157 --> 38:50.160
It does?

38:50.260 --> 38:52.915
That's exactly what I would
want to use in the book.

38:53.015 --> 38:59.821
Chris, it's not easy to relate to someone
who's accused of four murders.

39:00.869 --> 39:04.097
But everyone understands
a child needing a toy.

39:05.474 --> 39:10.163
And the teddy bear ending up...
It's like it died when she died.

39:11.580 --> 39:14.683
I never thought of it that way.

39:16.084 --> 39:18.145
This is my notebook from Africa.
You gotta see this.

39:19.045 --> 39:20.989
Look.

39:26.261 --> 39:28.530
That's weird.

39:28.630 --> 39:32.869
Two men, same age, from completely
different worlds, different educations,

39:32.969 --> 39:36.606
and yet... there's something
so similar about us.

39:39.841 --> 39:42.778
Some of what he writes is really...

39:42.878 --> 39:45.113
It's moving.

39:46.381 --> 39:49.417
You think he's innocent, don't you?

39:50.886 --> 39:53.600
I don't presume anything anymore.

39:54.339 --> 39:57.040
I'm going to say a word, then we just write
the first thing that comes to our mind.

39:57.140 --> 39:59.119
- Don't even think about it.
- All right.

39:59.219 --> 40:01.963
Okay? The future.

40:02.664 --> 40:04.700
Future?

40:15.577 --> 40:18.281
I wrote "always another opportunity."

40:19.281 --> 40:21.483
I didn't write anything.

40:25.821 --> 40:28.356
All right, you try one.

40:33.929 --> 40:35.209
Love.

40:44.840 --> 40:48.043
"Something I always screw up."

40:49.395 --> 40:51.880
That's depressing, but true.

40:51.980 --> 40:54.766
Oh, that's really weird, because...

40:54.866 --> 40:57.103
for "love" I wrote "Mike and Jill."

40:58.003 --> 40:59.304
What?

40:59.404 --> 41:03.141
I guess I was just looking at you and...

41:03.809 --> 41:06.745
I thought you were writing about her.

41:06.845 --> 41:09.014
Maybe you were, in a way.

41:10.682 --> 41:12.991
I'd have thought
you would have written "M.J."

41:16.288 --> 41:18.323
I couldn't.

41:18.924 --> 41:20.959
Why not?

41:23.763 --> 41:26.226
It's too complicated.

41:27.098 --> 41:29.301
What was she like?

41:29.601 --> 41:31.639
Beautiful.

41:32.088 --> 41:35.628
Supportive. She was a great mother.

41:36.975 --> 41:38.910
Loyal.

41:39.010 --> 41:42.147
We made a pact that...

41:42.247 --> 41:45.250
we would never lie to each other.

41:45.350 --> 41:48.086
That was very important.

41:49.888 --> 41:52.257
You must miss her.

41:55.593 --> 41:57.829
Yeah.

41:58.630 --> 42:01.199
She was like the ocean.

42:02.233 --> 42:03.669
How so?

42:04.736 --> 42:07.038
She was deep.

42:07.138 --> 42:09.374
Rolling.

42:10.508 --> 42:13.284
Sometimes stormy.

42:14.813 --> 42:17.349
That's really nice.

42:18.984 --> 42:21.686
Let's do one more.

42:23.121 --> 42:25.523
All right, but they're so hard.

42:25.623 --> 42:28.661
It's good that it's hard.
That's why it's a good exercise.

42:28.761 --> 42:30.795
Okay.

42:33.949 --> 42:35.563
"Lies."

42:37.535 --> 42:38.861
"Lies"?

42:57.255 --> 42:58.591
- I'm a liar?
- Yes.

42:58.691 --> 43:01.093
I'm a liar?

43:01.193 --> 43:03.462
You stole my identity.

43:03.562 --> 43:07.232
I was in Mexico. I mean,
who was I supposed to choose?

43:07.332 --> 43:09.768
I don't know. Dr. Seuss.

43:09.868 --> 43:12.838
No, I needed somebody that nobody knew.

43:12.938 --> 43:14.973
I'm sorry.

43:16.341 --> 43:18.990
No, it's okay. I know I'm a nobody.

43:20.178 --> 43:21.947
Not to me.

43:22.047 --> 43:25.016
You know his real name
was Theodor Geisel?

43:25.417 --> 43:28.820
Oh, yeah. Dr. Seuss. Yeah, I knew that.

43:28.920 --> 43:31.990
- You knew that?
- He was born in Wisconsin.

43:32.090 --> 43:36.395
There's a park there, with statues
of all the Dr. Seuss characters.

43:37.495 --> 43:39.765
You out-Seussed me. That's impressive.

43:39.865 --> 43:42.200
I have kids.

43:45.971 --> 43:49.207
We went to Seussland.

43:53.512 --> 43:55.847
Time to go.

43:58.350 --> 44:00.240
All right, buddy.

44:17.402 --> 44:19.822
Thanks, Mike.

44:20.871 --> 44:22.940
Let's go.

44:29.080 --> 44:30.298
The more I dig into this thing,

44:30.398 --> 44:32.484
the more I think it could be
the best thing I've ever worked on.

44:32.684 --> 44:35.452
- <i>And do you have a title in mind?</i>
- "True Story," I think.

44:35.552 --> 44:38.324
<i>True Story, right. And when do you think
you might be able to get us something?</i>

44:38.424 --> 44:41.478
Soon. Incredibly soon.

46:45.417 --> 46:48.253
Let's wrap it up, Shortstop.

46:48.686 --> 46:50.922
Shortstop.

46:51.189 --> 46:53.458
It's my nickname.

46:53.558 --> 46:55.126
Long-go.

46:55.226 --> 46:58.296
Short-stop.

47:01.466 --> 47:03.335
Shortstop.

47:03.435 --> 47:05.903
We'll give him the dedication.

47:08.073 --> 47:10.008
Dedicate...

47:10.108 --> 47:14.346
For the book. "For Shortstop."
Like a wink.

47:15.913 --> 47:18.383
What's a wink?

47:18.583 --> 47:20.218
A wink is...

47:20.318 --> 47:24.223
when a writer puts in a secret message
for someone special.

47:24.323 --> 47:26.724
Like a private joke.

47:27.825 --> 47:29.861
Cool.

47:30.295 --> 47:32.664
My mom will be proud.

47:37.835 --> 47:40.672
Chris, you know, if you're found guilty,

47:40.772 --> 47:42.908
I can't give you any money for the book.

47:43.108 --> 47:46.711
Even if I wanted to,
the law wouldn't allow it.

47:47.212 --> 47:49.547
I understand.

47:50.482 --> 47:53.118
Just as long as you're not hoping I am.

47:53.218 --> 47:55.420
Am what?

47:56.721 --> 47:59.190
Found guilty.

48:14.373 --> 48:15.674
Thank you.

48:18.376 --> 48:20.211
I just got off the phone
with HarperCollins.

48:20.561 --> 48:21.830
And?

48:21.930 --> 48:24.474
They offered me a $250,000 advance.

48:26.585 --> 48:28.488
They say it's exactly what they needed.
They loved the writing.

48:28.588 --> 48:32.446
They're very excited,
and they want me to sign up immediately.

48:35.660 --> 48:39.214
- And he told you the whole story?
- He told me what I needed.

48:40.165 --> 48:41.371
Did he do it?

48:47.638 --> 48:50.074
I don't know.

48:54.312 --> 48:56.996
Hey, could you...
be careful with that, please?

48:57.096 --> 49:00.192
- Sorry.
- No, no.

49:01.554 --> 49:06.023
It's just that I want to send them
a hard copy of the first chapters.

49:07.024 --> 49:10.095
- You okay?
- Yeah.

49:13.931 --> 49:16.634
I'm glad it all worked out.

49:17.168 --> 49:19.771
You should be proud.

49:26.578 --> 49:29.380
So how have you been this week?

49:31.484 --> 49:32.684
I'm...

49:32.784 --> 49:38.364
just thinking I should plead guilty
to everything, so it'll all be over.

49:39.524 --> 49:43.761
People are gonna think what they want
to think. It doesn't matter what I say.

49:43.861 --> 49:48.331
Chris, come on, of all people,
I know what it's like to avoid the truth.

49:49.200 --> 49:52.871
But I'm smart enough to know
a second chance when I see it.

49:52.971 --> 49:58.009
I've never admitted this
to anyone, not even Jill,

50:01.012 --> 50:04.569
but the things that I got fired for,

50:05.983 --> 50:08.119
I did them.

50:08.486 --> 50:11.089
When I wrote that Africa story,
I didn't mix up my notes.

50:11.189 --> 50:15.260
I didn't combine the characters
by accident.

50:15.360 --> 50:18.095
I knew what I was doing.

50:19.030 --> 50:21.782
I knew readers would care more
if they thought all these things

50:21.882 --> 50:25.069
happened to one kid instead of five.

50:25.169 --> 50:27.159
And I needed people to care.

50:28.373 --> 50:31.977
I got so wrapped up
in trying to tell a great story

50:32.077 --> 50:36.714
that I completely lost
my obligation to the truth.

50:37.949 --> 50:40.518
Don't make the same mistake I made.

50:40.618 --> 50:45.189
If you're covering for someone,
if you're lying for them,

50:45.657 --> 50:51.081
you may think it's easier,
but it will eat away at you.

50:51.181 --> 50:52.665
It will destroy you.

51:00.638 --> 51:05.345
<i>This is the plea hearing for the State
of Oregon versus Christian Michael Longo,</i>

51:05.445 --> 51:09.213
<i>case number VRN1641.</i>

51:10.882 --> 51:13.685
<i>Is the defendant in attendance
and represented?</i>

51:13.785 --> 51:15.850
<i>Yes, Your Honor.</i>

51:16.150 --> 51:17.999
<i>Would the defendant please rise?</i>

51:23.294 --> 51:26.964
<i>Mr. Longo, I will go over
the charges one by one...</i>

51:28.933 --> 51:31.895
<i>in the order they were filed.</i>

51:35.240 --> 51:39.977
<i>For the death of Zachary Longo,
how do you plead?</i>

51:41.613 --> 51:43.982
<i>My client pleads not guilty.</i>

51:46.351 --> 51:49.227
<i>For the death of Sadie Longo,
how do you plead?</i>

51:51.856 --> 51:55.760
<i>My client pleads not guilty, Your Honor.</i>

51:55.860 --> 51:58.464
<i>Hi, this is Mike Finkel.
I'm calling to see if case number 641</i>

51:58.564 --> 52:01.833
is out of plea hearings yet?
How did it go?

52:01.933 --> 52:04.636
<i>For the death of MaryJane Longo,
how do you plead?</i>

52:08.706 --> 52:10.722
My client pleads guilty.

52:19.283 --> 52:21.949
For the death of Madison Longo,
how do you plead?

52:22.620 --> 52:25.375
<i>My client pleads guilty.</i>

52:26.091 --> 52:27.580
<i>Order. Order.</i>

52:28.526 --> 52:30.662
Mr. Longo,

52:32.130 --> 52:36.334
you do realize how confusing
the court will find this plea.

52:36.434 --> 52:39.238
And that unless you have been
advised otherwise,

52:39.338 --> 52:42.674
you could be facing
a life sentence at the very least.

52:42.774 --> 52:45.673
Yes, sir, I do understand that.

52:46.411 --> 52:49.246
Do you have any questions?

52:50.281 --> 52:52.917
I do not.

52:53.818 --> 52:56.821
<i>But, Mike, everything you sent suggested
he was pleading innocent on all counts.</i>

52:56.921 --> 52:58.499
I know, I know.

52:58.599 --> 53:01.227
<i>And now every news outlet
in the country is covering the story,</i>

53:01.327 --> 53:03.628
<i>but you seem to be
completely in the dark.</i>

53:03.728 --> 53:05.597
Yes, I realize... I realize that.

53:05.697 --> 53:08.120
<i>Mike, we need your word you'll get us
something we can rely on.</i>

53:08.220 --> 53:10.601
<i>Without that, we have no book.</i>

53:12.687 --> 53:13.722
Fuck!

53:14.172 --> 53:15.607
What are you doing?

53:15.707 --> 53:17.709
- What are you doing?
- Mike...

53:17.809 --> 53:19.644
You told me you were innocent.

53:19.744 --> 53:22.448
- I'm sorry about that.
- You should be fucking sorry, Chris.

53:22.548 --> 53:25.884
Who pleads guilty to two murders
and innocent to two others?

53:25.984 --> 53:29.250
- Look, I...
- Stupid.

53:30.556 --> 53:33.458
Yo, Chris, I don't understand.

53:33.558 --> 53:35.507
And you seem to have no interest
in telling me the truth,

53:35.607 --> 53:37.462
so why should I believe
a word that you say?

53:37.562 --> 53:40.932
Sometimes the truth isn't believable.
That doesn't mean that it's not true.

53:41.032 --> 53:43.735
What the fuck are you talking about?

53:43.835 --> 53:48.239
Do you hear yourself? Just stop.
Tell me something real!

53:48.339 --> 53:51.809
Mike, I would, but I can't.
This isn't just about me.

53:51.909 --> 53:55.747
- Who? Who do you have to protect?
- I can't say.

53:56.047 --> 53:58.284
I know better than to blindly
trust my sources.

53:58.384 --> 54:01.152
If anybody on Earth knows that, it's me.

54:01.252 --> 54:03.856
But this is different, okay?
This has been months.

54:03.956 --> 54:06.625
My whole reputation's on the line,
or what's left of it anyway.

54:06.725 --> 54:08.926
Mike...

54:09.594 --> 54:12.396
you are a good friend.

54:13.030 --> 54:15.917
And I owe you so much.

54:16.017 --> 54:18.413
So, so much.

54:19.113 --> 54:22.473
Mike, don't give up on me.

54:23.474 --> 54:27.742
Writing with you has been the only thing
that's kept me going.

54:28.179 --> 54:30.582
How did it feel to write
about your family?

54:31.782 --> 54:33.518
It was hard.

54:38.022 --> 54:41.659
The trial for their murders begins tomorrow.
I suggest you think about them tonight.

54:42.359 --> 54:45.328
I think about them every night.

54:53.538 --> 54:55.807
Mr. Finkel?

54:56.207 --> 54:57.776
My name is Greg Ganley,

54:57.876 --> 55:00.528
I'm an investigator with the Oregon
Department of Justice.

55:00.628 --> 55:04.216
I'll be assisting the prosecution's office
in its case against Christian Longo.

55:04.316 --> 55:05.251
Okay.

55:05.351 --> 55:07.453
I was wondering if we might
be able to speak together.

55:07.553 --> 55:10.241
- Sure.
- Great.

55:10.341 --> 55:12.424
You want to go somewhere quiet?
More quiet?

55:12.524 --> 55:15.058
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

55:18.062 --> 55:21.332
I know you've been communicating
with Mr. Longo.

55:21.432 --> 55:23.619
Maybe he's even been candid with you

55:23.719 --> 55:26.604
about matters directly related
to the trial, I don't know.

55:26.704 --> 55:29.642
But I need to ask you
for help now for our side.

55:29.742 --> 55:32.643
So we can get some justice here.

55:33.043 --> 55:35.246
Help how?

55:35.346 --> 55:37.715
Tell us what you and Longo
have discussed.

55:37.815 --> 55:42.887
Let us review any letters or taped
conversations between the two of you.

55:44.422 --> 55:48.660
I... I can't do that.
I promised Chris I wouldn't.

55:48.760 --> 55:50.561
Let me spell this out for you.

55:50.661 --> 55:55.600
Your cooperation might make the difference
between him being found guilty or set free.

55:55.700 --> 55:58.870
Set free? What are you talking about?
He pleaded guilty.

55:58.970 --> 56:02.040
No. We think he might be
trying to confuse the jury

56:02.140 --> 56:04.242
as part of some bigger game plan.

56:04.342 --> 56:08.246
If he can sow enough doubt
to force a mistrial, he's won.

56:08.346 --> 56:09.811
I know this doesn't make
any sense right now,

56:09.911 --> 56:13.885
but I've seen a lot of killers
in court down the years.

56:13.985 --> 56:18.155
Most of the time, they look like
cornered foxes, wild and confused.

56:18.255 --> 56:21.893
Longo has this calm about him.

56:21.993 --> 56:24.529
He knows something.

56:25.796 --> 56:29.534
I believe we're dealing with an exceptionally
dangerous man who has killed before,

56:29.634 --> 56:34.772
and he will kill again if he is allowed.
So, what can you do for us?

56:42.379 --> 56:47.051
I'm trying to make you feel bad enough
or guilty enough to talk to me.

56:47.151 --> 56:50.888
I'm putting the turd, so to speak,
in your pocket.

56:53.624 --> 56:57.962
Are you really going to be the man
who might set him free?

56:58.496 --> 57:03.100
You've done your thing.
This is for the law now.

57:08.138 --> 57:10.641
I can't help you.

57:11.008 --> 57:13.444
Can I ask why?

57:13.544 --> 57:16.415
Is it because you don't want
to share your scoop, is that it?

57:16.515 --> 57:19.559
You want to keep it all for yourself?

57:29.394 --> 57:31.528
All right.

57:32.830 --> 57:35.666
I said what I wanted to say.

57:41.472 --> 57:44.841
Why don't you give me a call
if you're having trouble sleeping.

58:16.674 --> 58:18.743
Hello?

58:19.043 --> 58:23.381
<i>Jill, hey. It's nice to meet you.</i>

58:23.481 --> 58:26.484
<i>Meet... meet your voice, anyways.</i>

58:27.284 --> 58:29.403
- Chris?
- <i>Exactly.</i>

58:29.503 --> 58:32.824
Hi. I was trying to reach Mike,

58:32.924 --> 58:35.627
but I couldn't get him
on his cell phone, so...

58:36.427 --> 58:38.563
<i>I was wondering if you'd take
a message for me?</i>

58:38.663 --> 58:40.665
Okay.

58:41.565 --> 58:44.038
<i>Just tell him that my lawyer said</i>

58:44.138 --> 58:48.706
<i>he can get him a seat when the trial
begins tomorrow. Okay?</i>

58:48.806 --> 58:50.708
Sure.

58:50.808 --> 58:54.912
<i>Great. Well, it's truly nice
to talk to you, Jill.</i>

58:55.312 --> 58:58.616
You know, Mike's such a...
such a sweet guy.

58:58.716 --> 59:03.287
And he's been a... he's been
a real friend to me.

59:03.904 --> 59:06.041
<i>I'm sure he's like that with everyone.</i>

59:06.191 --> 59:08.392
No, I think you're special.

59:08.492 --> 59:11.996
<i>Yeah, well, exactly. It...</i>

59:12.096 --> 59:16.434
<i>feels like we've known each other,
like, from before.</i>

59:18.969 --> 59:20.871
And he really loves you.

59:20.971 --> 59:26.510
<i>You know. Even if he... seems like
he doesn't want to let it out.</i>

59:26.610 --> 59:28.747
He told you that?

59:28.847 --> 59:32.149
<i>Yeah. He tells me everything.</i>

59:32.249 --> 59:35.052
<i>Life in Finkelwood,</i>

59:35.152 --> 59:38.155
<i>his record collection,</i>

59:38.255 --> 59:40.528
<i>your old piano,</i>

59:40.628 --> 59:44.395
that bathtub you bought together.

59:44.495 --> 59:46.231
He just goes on and on.

59:46.531 --> 59:50.000
<i>It's like I'm writing the book about him,
rather than him about me.</i>

59:50.100 --> 59:54.471
<i>I know he must be under
a lot of pressure, though.</i>

59:56.373 --> 01:00:00.544
<i>It must be hard for you to have him
so preoccupied like that.</i>

01:00:00.644 --> 01:00:03.647
You know nothing about me.

01:00:06.817 --> 01:00:09.753
It feels like I do, though.

01:00:11.522 --> 01:00:14.558
I don't mean to make you uncomfortable.

01:00:14.658 --> 01:00:19.063
I just hope that we can be friends, too.

01:00:19.163 --> 01:00:21.099
<i>I'd really like that.</i>

01:00:21.199 --> 01:00:24.202
<i>Mike means so much to both of us.</i>

01:00:24.868 --> 01:00:30.207
<i>Oh, my... my credit's up.
Will you let him know?</i>

01:00:30.307 --> 01:00:31.942
Sure.

01:00:32.042 --> 01:00:34.378
<i>Thanks, Jill.</i>

01:00:48.125 --> 01:00:50.512
<i>I'm standing outside
Lincoln County Courthouse,</i>

01:00:50.612 --> 01:00:54.466
<i>where prosecutors say they will seek
the death penalty for Christian Longo,</i>

01:00:54.566 --> 01:00:57.669
<i>who has been charged with aggravated
murder in the deaths of his wife...</i>

01:01:27.965 --> 01:01:29.934
Be seated.

01:01:56.026 --> 01:01:58.329
December 16th.

01:01:58.629 --> 01:02:02.166
It's a night we're going to spend
a lot of time talking about.

01:02:06.270 --> 01:02:10.541
It was the last night in this woman
and these children's lives.

01:02:10.641 --> 01:02:12.760
MaryJane Longo, 34.

01:02:12.860 --> 01:02:16.013
Zachary Longo, four years old.
Sadie Longo...

01:02:16.113 --> 01:02:18.650
During questioning,
I asked him what happened to his family.

01:02:18.750 --> 01:02:21.553
And he said he'd sent them
to a better place.

01:02:21.653 --> 01:02:24.421
A better place?
What do you think he meant by that?

01:02:24.521 --> 01:02:26.057
Do you believe that he had
murdered his family?

01:02:26.157 --> 01:02:27.991
- That he had, or that...
- Objection.

01:02:28.091 --> 01:02:29.159
Overruled.

01:02:29.259 --> 01:02:32.314
A car like that up on a bridge
at 4:30 in the morning?

01:02:32.414 --> 01:02:36.433
I mean, I've lived up there
my whole life, and that's unusual.

01:02:36.533 --> 01:02:38.637
Anyway, I heard a couple of splashes.

01:02:38.937 --> 01:02:43.603
So I called up and asked him
what was going on.

01:02:43.703 --> 01:02:45.844
He said, "Nothing."

01:02:45.944 --> 01:02:49.214
- Could you recognize that man today?
- Yeah... Yeah.

01:02:49.314 --> 01:02:51.982
Could you point to the man?

01:02:53.417 --> 01:02:57.304
Let the record show the witness
points to the defendant.

01:02:57.454 --> 01:02:59.356
Do you know the defendant?

01:02:59.456 --> 01:03:01.864
- Yes, I do.
- How do you know him?

01:03:01.964 --> 01:03:05.062
I am the manager at the Starbucks
where he worked.

01:03:05.162 --> 01:03:07.965
- How long did he work for you?
- About two months.

01:03:08.065 --> 01:03:11.804
- When was the last time you saw him?
- December 17th.

01:03:11.904 --> 01:03:15.322
In the morning, he came in
to work about an hour late.

01:03:15.422 --> 01:03:18.209
This was the day after the murders.

01:03:18.309 --> 01:03:20.779
- Yes.
- Did he say anything?

01:03:20.879 --> 01:03:24.481
He said his wife
had left him for another man.

01:03:24.581 --> 01:03:26.917
A reporter.

01:03:27.017 --> 01:03:30.167
- How did he seem?
- <i>The same as always</i>.

01:03:30.267 --> 01:03:32.489
<i>Very calm.</i>

01:03:32.589 --> 01:03:34.625
<i>Very remote.</i>

01:03:34.725 --> 01:03:38.462
<i>You say you know the defendant.
When did you last see him?</i>

01:03:38.562 --> 01:03:39.852
<i>December 19th.</i>

01:03:39.952 --> 01:03:42.611
<i>December 19th.
Two days after the murder?</i>

01:03:42.711 --> 01:03:44.636
- <i>Yes.</i>
- <i>What was he doing?</i>

01:03:44.736 --> 01:03:46.103
<i>Playing basketball.</i>

01:03:46.203 --> 01:03:48.974
<i>He was playing basketball two days
after his wife and children were murdered?</i>

01:03:49.074 --> 01:03:50.308
<i>Yeah. We attend the same gym.</i>

01:03:50.408 --> 01:03:52.775
Neither of the children's bodies
displayed any evidence

01:03:52.875 --> 01:03:54.619
of having struggled with an attacker,

01:03:54.719 --> 01:03:57.849
which suggests they likely
knew and trusted their killer.

01:04:00.584 --> 01:04:05.055
Both Zachary and Sadie
had Play-Doh under their fingernails.

01:04:06.223 --> 01:04:10.127
Sadie's toenails were painted
with a pearlescent polish,

01:04:10.227 --> 01:04:13.470
the same as on MaryJane's toes.

01:04:14.081 --> 01:04:16.984
They likely painted them together.

01:04:19.002 --> 01:04:21.505
Madison...

01:04:21.605 --> 01:04:24.541
was found in the suitcase.

01:04:26.310 --> 01:04:29.915
Tiny scratch marks here indicate

01:04:30.015 --> 01:04:34.385
Madison must have come around
at some point before she drowned.

01:04:34.485 --> 01:04:39.123
Dozens of facial capillaries burst
as she struggled for air.

01:04:39.223 --> 01:04:42.292
MaryJane's body was found
in this suitcase.

01:04:42.392 --> 01:04:45.563
This was a violent and frenzied act.

01:04:45.863 --> 01:04:48.232
A ferocious attack.

01:04:48.332 --> 01:04:50.768
Her neck has been broken.

01:04:50.868 --> 01:04:53.104
Though this looks like it may
have happened after she died,

01:04:53.204 --> 01:04:56.333
when she was forced into the suitcase.

01:04:57.241 --> 01:05:00.344
The prosecution rests, Your Honor.

01:05:01.078 --> 01:05:04.148
Then we shall begin
with the defense's first witness,

01:05:04.248 --> 01:05:07.518
Christian Longo, tomorrow morning.

01:05:07.618 --> 01:05:11.021
This court is hereby adjourned
until 10:00 a.m. tomorrow.

01:05:20.130 --> 01:05:23.249
- I'm very sorry.
- For what?

01:05:23.349 --> 01:05:25.903
This must be an incredibly
difficult day for your family.

01:05:26.003 --> 01:05:29.840
Why are you talking to me? Do you need
this scene for your book or something?

01:05:29.940 --> 01:05:33.411
- No, not at all.
- But you're still writing it?

01:05:34.878 --> 01:05:37.190
- I have a commission I have to honor.
- You had a choice

01:05:37.290 --> 01:05:40.785
of so many stories to tell,
and you chose his.

01:05:41.135 --> 01:05:44.071
Actually, he picked me.

01:05:44.521 --> 01:05:49.126
You pick your wedding day, Mr. Finkel,
your children's names.

01:05:49.226 --> 01:05:53.130
The important things.
He didn't pick you. He used you.

01:05:53.730 --> 01:05:56.566
Oh, God.

01:07:28.759 --> 01:07:32.162
<i>So, the night of the 15th,</i>

01:07:32.262 --> 01:07:37.168
<i>you were honest with her
about your debts for the first time?</i>

01:07:37.868 --> 01:07:41.405
<i>Maybe it was too much
all at once like that, but...</i>

01:07:41.505 --> 01:07:43.607
<i>yes, I told her everything.</i>

01:07:43.707 --> 01:07:47.677
<i>She had tears in her eyes.</i>

01:07:47.777 --> 01:07:51.916
But I intended to
put it all out into the open.

01:07:52.516 --> 01:07:54.418
Go on.

01:07:54.518 --> 01:07:56.403
So I told her.

01:07:56.503 --> 01:07:59.724
I told her that we weren't
paid up on the condo.

01:07:59.824 --> 01:08:01.692
And that we'd have to move again.

01:08:01.792 --> 01:08:06.030
About the credit cards that I'd gotten
by forging her father's signature.

01:08:06.130 --> 01:08:09.734
About the counterfeit checks.
About stealing the van.

01:08:10.534 --> 01:08:12.836
I think that hurt her the most.

01:08:12.936 --> 01:08:18.174
I'd given it to her for our anniversary.

01:08:19.276 --> 01:08:21.211
She'd always wanted one.

01:08:21.310 --> 01:08:24.680
How did she react when you told her?

01:08:25.415 --> 01:08:28.118
She was pretty shaken up.

01:08:28.218 --> 01:08:31.354
When I told her about the van,
she hit me.

01:08:31.455 --> 01:08:34.725
She was screaming that
I should get out and leave her alone.

01:08:34.825 --> 01:08:37.161
I'd never seen her like that.

01:08:38.161 --> 01:08:41.356
Zach and Sadie were asleep
in the living room, and...

01:08:41.456 --> 01:08:44.335
so I just went and joined them.

01:08:44.435 --> 01:08:47.037
When I woke up, it was morning.

01:08:47.138 --> 01:08:52.175
I made the kids breakfast.
I went in to check on MaryJane.

01:08:53.577 --> 01:08:57.247
She was asleep with Maddie.

01:08:57.346 --> 01:09:00.283
When I woke her, she pushed past me
and went into the bathroom.

01:09:00.783 --> 01:09:03.821
<i>So I took Maddie and sat with her
in the living room with the kids.</i>

01:09:04.256 --> 01:09:06.060
We...

01:09:06.161 --> 01:09:09.465
made some animals out of Play-Doh.

01:09:12.946 --> 01:09:16.768
And then it was getting close to the time
I was supposed to be at work.

01:09:16.868 --> 01:09:20.370
So I offered to call in sick,

01:09:20.470 --> 01:09:24.308
but MaryJane said I had to go
because we were in such a deep hole,

01:09:24.408 --> 01:09:26.843
we couldn't afford
any more sick days. So...

01:09:26.943 --> 01:09:30.014
she got dressed and drove me to work.

01:09:30.613 --> 01:09:32.515
And...

01:09:32.616 --> 01:09:34.484
I worried about her all day.

01:09:34.785 --> 01:09:37.787
<i>But when I got home, late,</i>

01:09:39.756 --> 01:09:42.259
the door was open.

01:09:42.359 --> 01:09:44.928
She was inside.

01:09:45.028 --> 01:09:47.831
She was wearing just her robe.

01:09:48.899 --> 01:09:51.984
And she wouldn't speak.

01:09:52.935 --> 01:09:55.406
And then she collapsed.

01:09:56.006 --> 01:09:58.675
I asked her what was wrong.

01:09:58.775 --> 01:10:00.811
And I was actually

01:10:00.911 --> 01:10:03.948
getting irritated because
she wouldn't answer.

01:10:04.048 --> 01:10:05.816
She was just sobbing.

01:10:06.516 --> 01:10:11.846
So I went into the bedroom to change,

01:10:12.789 --> 01:10:15.392
and that's...

01:10:16.159 --> 01:10:18.762
That's when I saw Madison.

01:10:19.112 --> 01:10:21.765
She was...

01:10:21.865 --> 01:10:23.834
tangled in the sheets.

01:10:23.934 --> 01:10:27.704
She looked sick. Purplish.

01:10:27.804 --> 01:10:30.107
She wasn't moving.

01:10:30.207 --> 01:10:34.746
So, I went over and sort of jostled her.

01:10:34.846 --> 01:10:37.547
That's when I discovered
that she was cold to the touch.

01:10:37.947 --> 01:10:40.302
Very cold.

01:10:41.084 --> 01:10:42.520
And I couldn't...

01:10:42.620 --> 01:10:45.622
I couldn't believe what was happening.

01:10:45.922 --> 01:10:47.791
I ran into the living room.

01:10:48.091 --> 01:10:51.061
I grabbed MaryJane
and lifted her to her feet.

01:10:51.161 --> 01:10:53.730
And I was... I was yelling,

01:10:53.830 --> 01:10:57.034
"What happened to Maddie?
What... What's wrong with her?"

01:11:01.104 --> 01:11:07.444
And that's when I realized...
what about Zach and Sadie?

01:11:07.544 --> 01:11:12.116
And when I said their names out loud,
MaryJane got hysterical.

01:11:12.216 --> 01:11:15.453
She started hitting me with her fists.

01:11:15.553 --> 01:11:17.855
And I was saying,

01:11:17.955 --> 01:11:21.658
"You have to control yourself.
You have to tell me what happened."

01:11:21.958 --> 01:11:24.694
<i>I was just trying to shake her.</i>

01:11:25.929 --> 01:11:28.634
<i>She looked me right in the eye.</i>

01:11:29.232 --> 01:11:31.768
And she said,

01:11:32.235 --> 01:11:34.489
"You did this.

01:11:35.105 --> 01:11:37.812
"This is your fault."

01:11:39.342 --> 01:11:43.113
And I didn't know
what she was talking about.

01:11:44.481 --> 01:11:47.450
And then she said,

01:11:48.351 --> 01:11:50.854
"You did this.

01:11:51.388 --> 01:11:54.090
"You killed us."

01:11:56.759 --> 01:11:59.397
So, I had her up against the wall

01:11:59.497 --> 01:12:04.000
and I was just trying to get her
to tell me where the kids were.

01:12:04.701 --> 01:12:06.903
I was shoving her,

01:12:07.003 --> 01:12:10.473
just trying to force her to tell me.

01:12:12.609 --> 01:12:16.746
But you know I... I lost control and...

01:12:16.846 --> 01:12:19.482
I was so angry.

01:12:20.517 --> 01:12:22.952
What did she say?

01:12:28.758 --> 01:12:31.093
She said...

01:12:32.062 --> 01:12:33.641
they were in the water.

01:12:38.768 --> 01:12:41.237
Order, please.

01:12:45.175 --> 01:12:48.178
She said they were in the bay.

01:12:48.278 --> 01:12:51.981
And she slumped to the floor.

01:12:53.683 --> 01:12:55.819
I...

01:12:56.219 --> 01:12:59.789
picked her up by her throat.

01:13:00.423 --> 01:13:04.127
She grabbed my forearm.

01:13:04.561 --> 01:13:07.516
But she let me do it.

01:13:10.667 --> 01:13:14.065
And I know that's how she died.

01:13:18.675 --> 01:13:20.659
What did you do then?

01:13:21.644 --> 01:13:24.581
I went and got the...

01:13:24.681 --> 01:13:29.018
big suitcase and a little suitcase.

01:13:29.352 --> 01:13:32.856
And I put MaryJane in the big suitcase.

01:13:32.956 --> 01:13:36.693
And I intended to do
the same with Madison...

01:13:38.995 --> 01:13:45.213
when my heart stopped.
Because she was still breathing.

01:13:46.469 --> 01:13:49.045
Not very well, but she was.

01:13:51.007 --> 01:13:54.143
So I laid her down.

01:13:56.246 --> 01:13:57.797
And...

01:13:58.381 --> 01:14:03.652
even though she was breathing,
I... considered her already dead.

01:14:04.387 --> 01:14:07.791
There was nothing I could do for her.

01:14:07.891 --> 01:14:09.826
Nothing.

01:14:10.076 --> 01:14:12.479
So I...

01:14:13.029 --> 01:14:16.032
put my hand over her...

01:14:16.132 --> 01:14:18.401
little neck.

01:14:18.735 --> 01:14:20.904
And I squeezed.

01:14:26.242 --> 01:14:29.612
I could feel the life going out of her.

01:14:33.383 --> 01:14:36.653
And then she breathed again.

01:14:37.153 --> 01:14:40.089
So I squeezed harder.

01:14:45.396 --> 01:14:49.632
And then... I realized I couldn't...

01:14:49.732 --> 01:14:54.371
I couldn't put her in the suitcase
like that. It was too big.

01:14:56.172 --> 01:14:59.203
<i>I just wanted her to be comfortable.</i>

01:15:00.910 --> 01:15:05.081
<i>So I... I lay in some of her clothes.</i>

01:15:05.181 --> 01:15:08.351
<i>I put in all her favorite things.</i>

01:15:08.451 --> 01:15:12.722
<i>All the things
that would make her happy.</i>

01:15:13.056 --> 01:15:16.392
<i>And her favorite teddy bear.</i>

01:15:18.561 --> 01:15:23.666
<i>It was almost like the teddy bear
died when she died.</i>

01:15:26.636 --> 01:15:29.940
And then I took the suitcases
out to the bay and I...

01:15:30.940 --> 01:15:33.743
put them in the water.

01:15:34.077 --> 01:15:36.379
And I drove to the bridge.

01:15:36.479 --> 01:15:39.349
And I just...

01:15:39.449 --> 01:15:44.087
I just stayed there,
thinking about my children.

01:15:50.093 --> 01:15:52.562
Why do you think she would do this?

01:15:52.662 --> 01:15:56.817
Why not just take the kids and leave?

01:16:00.336 --> 01:16:03.139
She told me once...

01:16:03.239 --> 01:16:07.248
that if I ever left her,
she wouldn't be able to go on.

01:16:08.344 --> 01:16:11.915
And so by doing this...

01:16:12.015 --> 01:16:15.319
maybe she was trying to show me
how much I meant to her.

01:16:16.219 --> 01:16:19.622
Maybe she thought she could
make something good

01:16:19.722 --> 01:16:23.059
out of two things that were bad.

01:16:27.197 --> 01:16:29.366
Like a double negative.

01:16:36.739 --> 01:16:39.075
The defense rests.

01:16:41.077 --> 01:16:43.346
Court adjourned.

01:17:08.438 --> 01:17:11.975
I have something for you.
It's my correspondence from Longo.

01:17:12.675 --> 01:17:14.610
Look.

01:17:14.710 --> 01:17:18.118
I have over 100 letters back home.
This one was over 80 pages.

01:17:18.218 --> 01:17:19.770
You should submit this.

01:17:21.951 --> 01:17:24.487
- Did you write back?
- Sometimes.

01:17:24.687 --> 01:17:26.118
Pen pals.

01:17:27.223 --> 01:17:30.694
You might want to look after them.
You're gonna need them for that book.

01:17:30.794 --> 01:17:33.263
This is material evidence.

01:17:33.363 --> 01:17:36.966
You want to see what material evidence
looks like, you come by my office.

01:17:37.066 --> 01:17:39.519
But you can put that away. It's done.

01:17:39.619 --> 01:17:42.640
If you had legally compelled me to testify,
you would have had this.

01:17:42.740 --> 01:17:45.208
It could have influenced the jury.

01:17:45.708 --> 01:17:48.144
Yeah, I know.

01:17:48.644 --> 01:17:53.188
If they find for manslaughter,
he might be out in a few years.

01:17:54.718 --> 01:17:59.641
But in the end, you wouldn't have made
a very good witness, credibility-wise.

01:18:00.723 --> 01:18:02.759
You've been through a sort of...

01:18:02.859 --> 01:18:04.994
trial of your own recently.

01:18:05.094 --> 01:18:08.123
And the verdict was you're a liar.

01:18:11.367 --> 01:18:15.371
We better hope the jury comes
to the same conclusion about him.

01:18:47.537 --> 01:18:50.472
I thought you'd be taller.

01:18:51.540 --> 01:18:53.209
Why?

01:18:53.309 --> 01:18:55.212
I don't know.

01:18:55.312 --> 01:18:58.314
Maybe because he looks up to you.

01:18:58.414 --> 01:19:01.984
No. I look up to him.

01:19:06.422 --> 01:19:09.458
Is it too cold for you in here?

01:19:09.558 --> 01:19:12.428
No, I'm fine.

01:19:14.197 --> 01:19:16.345
Is... Is he okay?

01:19:18.901 --> 01:19:21.138
I was hoping you could tell me.

01:19:22.705 --> 01:19:26.109
Well, we don't talk as much anymore.

01:19:26.209 --> 01:19:29.011
That's two of us.

01:19:32.815 --> 01:19:36.085
I haven't seen a woman in so long.

01:19:36.185 --> 01:19:38.621
Looking at you is...

01:19:38.721 --> 01:19:40.741
like seeing the ocean.

01:19:41.591 --> 01:19:43.336
I'm more of a pond, I think.

01:19:47.597 --> 01:19:50.566
Can I play you something?

01:20:06.249 --> 01:20:09.785
<i>"Se la mia morte brami."</i>

01:20:10.987 --> 01:20:14.323
"If you crave my death."

01:20:16.359 --> 01:20:19.996
Carlo Gesualdo wrote it in 1611,

01:20:20.096 --> 01:20:24.166
a few years after killing
his wife and newborn son.

01:20:26.135 --> 01:20:28.004
His wife had a lover.

01:20:28.104 --> 01:20:30.990
So he tracked them down
with a hunting knife.

01:20:31.090 --> 01:20:35.545
He stabbed her many,
many times all over her body.

01:20:35.645 --> 01:20:38.431
And as she was bleeding
to death on the floor,

01:20:38.531 --> 01:20:41.518
he forced the lover to strip her naked,

01:20:41.618 --> 01:20:46.097
put on her bloody nightdress
and humiliate himself.

01:20:47.056 --> 01:20:50.059
Before shooting him in the head.

01:20:51.694 --> 01:20:54.464
Then he went upstairs

01:20:54.564 --> 01:20:59.942
and beat his infant son to death
against the side of his crib.

01:21:01.437 --> 01:21:05.442
That music is almost beautiful enough
to make me forget him,

01:21:05.542 --> 01:21:08.868
listening to something
written by a man who...

01:21:08.968 --> 01:21:13.709
broke his baby's skull
on a piece of furniture.

01:21:16.185 --> 01:21:18.554
But not quite.

01:21:23.326 --> 01:21:26.729
You see, Mike wants to try
and understand you.

01:21:26.829 --> 01:21:29.297
I think he believes
that if he can understand you,

01:21:29.397 --> 01:21:32.336
then maybe he can understand himself.

01:21:33.236 --> 01:21:37.040
But I don't want
to understand you at all.

01:21:37.340 --> 01:21:39.976
You're a murderer.

01:21:40.076 --> 01:21:43.146
You kill women and children.

01:21:43.846 --> 01:21:47.370
You're a narcissist who resents
every single second of attention

01:21:47.470 --> 01:21:49.911
not given to you.

01:21:50.453 --> 01:21:53.239
I'm here to tell you that
whatever else is coming to you,

01:21:53.339 --> 01:21:56.041
you will never...

01:21:56.141 --> 01:21:59.733
ever escape what you are.

01:22:10.840 --> 01:22:13.220
<i>Members of the jury,
have you come to a verdict</i>

01:22:13.320 --> 01:22:17.814
<i>in the case of the State of Oregon against
the defendant, Christian Michael Longo?</i>

01:22:17.914 --> 01:22:19.550
<i>We have, Your Honor.</i>

01:22:19.650 --> 01:22:23.419
<i>Clerk of the court,
let the verdict be submitted.</i>

01:22:23.519 --> 01:22:27.657
<i>For the murder of Sadie Longo,
how do you find the defendant?</i>

01:22:27.757 --> 01:22:29.725
<i>Guilty, Your Honor.</i>

01:22:29.825 --> 01:22:33.729
<i>And for the murder of Zachary Longo,
how do you find the defendant?</i>

01:22:33.829 --> 01:22:36.099
<i>Guilty, Your Honor.</i>

01:22:36.199 --> 01:22:40.904
For the murder of MaryJane Longo, should
the defendant receive a sentence of death?

01:22:41.004 --> 01:22:45.040
To this question,
the jury has answered yes.

01:22:45.309 --> 01:22:48.777
For the murder of Madison Longo,
Zachary Longo, and Sadie Longo,

01:22:48.877 --> 01:22:52.381
to this question,
the jury has answered yes.

01:22:52.881 --> 01:22:54.633
The jury is dismissed.

01:22:59.705 --> 01:23:01.457
Okay.

01:23:01.557 --> 01:23:04.650
It's done. I'll be outside.

01:23:08.064 --> 01:23:10.167
Order.

01:23:10.667 --> 01:23:12.735
Order.

01:23:17.240 --> 01:23:18.497
Mr. Longo,

01:23:19.809 --> 01:23:23.341
you had the opportunity to spare
the relatives of your victims

01:23:23.441 --> 01:23:28.340
further pain by admitting
the true extent of your crime.

01:23:29.819 --> 01:23:34.490
Instead, you manipulated this court
like you manipulated your family

01:23:34.590 --> 01:23:38.494
despite the overwhelming
evidence against you.

01:23:40.829 --> 01:23:42.747
Blaming your wife

01:23:42.847 --> 01:23:45.735
for killing her own children

01:23:45.835 --> 01:23:51.207
was a grotesque betrayal,
both of her and her memory.

01:23:51.807 --> 01:23:56.111
You must have realized
no one would believe you.

01:23:58.114 --> 01:24:01.294
Quite frankly, you are a mystery to me.

01:24:02.885 --> 01:24:06.955
And, God willing, you will remain so.

01:24:08.023 --> 01:24:12.662
I therefore place you in the custody
of the Oregon Department of Corrections

01:24:12.762 --> 01:24:17.700
for transport to death row
at the Oregon State Penitentiary.

01:24:17.800 --> 01:24:19.803
Court is adjourned.

01:26:45.080 --> 01:26:46.440
I knew you'd come.

01:26:48.551 --> 01:26:50.386
You look good.

01:26:52.155 --> 01:26:54.723
I'm still writing.

01:26:55.191 --> 01:26:57.960
Nobody wrote me back
at first, which hurt.

01:26:58.060 --> 01:27:01.274
And I must be getting better, because...

01:27:01.374 --> 01:27:04.129
I've had two marriage proposals.

01:27:04.229 --> 01:27:06.869
Good luck with that.

01:27:07.269 --> 01:27:12.174
The only good thing that came out
of all this is that I got to meet you.

01:27:12.274 --> 01:27:15.177
And I even screwed that up.

01:27:15.277 --> 01:27:17.813
I regret that.

01:27:17.913 --> 01:27:19.849
Me, too.

01:27:21.116 --> 01:27:23.319
Yeah.

01:27:23.419 --> 01:27:26.075
Is that why you wrote to me?

01:27:29.392 --> 01:27:33.095
You're ready? To tell the truth?

01:27:41.671 --> 01:27:44.439
I did it.

01:27:46.475 --> 01:27:49.511
I killed MaryJane.

01:27:50.713 --> 01:27:55.484
When I got there that night,
she was straddling the bed

01:27:55.584 --> 01:28:00.456
and she was pushing a pillow
down towards the mattress.

01:28:00.556 --> 01:28:04.293
Underneath, I saw Madison. Fighting.

01:28:04.393 --> 01:28:06.029
I don't know why she was doing it,

01:28:06.129 --> 01:28:09.465
but I was furious that she was
taking it out on our daughter.

01:28:09.565 --> 01:28:13.703
And then I snapped. I went crazy, Mike.

01:28:13.803 --> 01:28:18.441
I must have killed Zach and Sadie,
but I don't remember.

01:28:18.541 --> 01:28:20.710
I... I don't remember anything.

01:28:20.810 --> 01:28:24.414
I don't even know
which one I killed first.

01:28:24.514 --> 01:28:26.628
It's just a blank.

01:28:26.728 --> 01:28:29.018
The first thing I remember
is waking up in the airport.

01:28:29.118 --> 01:28:31.187
You blacked out?

01:28:31.287 --> 01:28:33.690
You know, that can count
as temporary insanity.

01:28:34.290 --> 01:28:37.060
Well, I have a new lawyer.
He's filing an appeal.

01:28:37.360 --> 01:28:40.380
It's powerful. But it makes no sense.

01:28:40.480 --> 01:28:43.901
Even if MaryJane had wanted to kill Madison,
she would've had the entire day.

01:28:44.001 --> 01:28:47.070
Why would she wait for you to get home
so you could catch her in the act?

01:28:47.170 --> 01:28:50.874
Either she's calculating or she's out
of her mind. You can't have it both ways.

01:28:50.974 --> 01:28:54.076
The only thing that makes sense
is a break-in.

01:28:54.176 --> 01:28:57.947
You came home, you found everyone
dead, you panicked.

01:28:58.047 --> 01:28:59.849
You thought someone
was trying to frame you.

01:28:59.949 --> 01:29:02.919
So you dumped the bodies
and you went on the run.

01:29:03.019 --> 01:29:07.089
But somebody else killed them.
Is that possible?

01:29:07.189 --> 01:29:08.930
Maybe.

01:29:09.030 --> 01:29:10.560
No, it's not.

01:29:10.660 --> 01:29:15.798
None of those stories hold water
because they're all fucking lies.

01:29:16.365 --> 01:29:21.036
You killed them, you sick fuck.
You killed all of them.

01:29:21.136 --> 01:29:23.473
Your lawyer called me for the appeal.

01:29:23.573 --> 01:29:26.125
He asked me to be
a character reference for you.

01:29:26.225 --> 01:29:29.044
The first thing I tell the judge
is look out for the lies.

01:29:29.544 --> 01:29:31.614
Look out for temporary insanity.

01:29:31.714 --> 01:29:35.050
Look out for self-defense.
Look out for intruder.

01:29:35.150 --> 01:29:40.088
Look out for every wet-eyed piece
of bullshit he serves up.

01:29:45.293 --> 01:29:47.830
How's the book, Mike?

01:29:48.964 --> 01:29:50.860
How are the sales?

01:29:54.870 --> 01:29:58.607
You didn't have to finish it.
But you did.

01:29:58.707 --> 01:30:01.844
Because you couldn't help yourself.

01:30:03.646 --> 01:30:07.016
- We're not so different.
- Yes, we are.

01:30:07.516 --> 01:30:12.455
All these stories... you know what?
No one's listening anymore.

01:30:12.555 --> 01:30:15.023
One person is.

01:30:15.123 --> 01:30:17.526
You, Mike.

01:30:18.026 --> 01:30:22.031
I'm the most important thing
that ever happened to you.

01:30:22.431 --> 01:30:24.734
From now on, you'll just be the guy

01:30:24.834 --> 01:30:27.970
who talked to the guy
who killed his family.

01:30:28.070 --> 01:30:30.539
And that's it.

01:30:32.174 --> 01:30:37.180
And if I ever open my mouth,
you'll just come running.

01:31:01.036 --> 01:31:02.938
"I hated him.

01:31:03.038 --> 01:31:05.869
"I hated him in the intense way
that you can only hate someone

01:31:05.969 --> 01:31:08.511
"who you truly care about.

01:31:08.611 --> 01:31:10.846
"I'd been fascinated by Longo.

01:31:10.946 --> 01:31:13.782
"And also been fooled by him.

01:31:13.882 --> 01:31:16.386
"He was gone, condemned to die.

01:31:16.486 --> 01:31:19.288
"And I had the sense of having
survived something.

01:31:19.388 --> 01:31:21.457
"A storm of sorts.

01:31:21.557 --> 01:31:26.595
"But although I was alive and intact,
that was all I'd been left with."

01:31:27.195 --> 01:31:29.223
Thank you.

01:31:34.169 --> 01:31:38.057
If we could, Mr. Finkel, your publishers
promised us a Q and A.

01:31:38.157 --> 01:31:41.451
I know there are a lot of folks
with questions. Isn't that right?

01:31:41.551 --> 01:31:42.578
Yes?

01:31:42.678 --> 01:31:46.382
Mr. Finkel, do you think
he'll kill again, like in prison maybe?

01:31:47.383 --> 01:31:48.818
I doubt it. He's locked up.

01:31:49.118 --> 01:31:53.722
Will they have to restrain him?
With straps and stuff?

01:31:54.022 --> 01:31:56.024
No.

01:31:56.425 --> 01:32:01.324
Where would you place him on a list
of comparable killers, Mr. Finkel?

01:32:01.897 --> 01:32:04.733
Like Ted Bundy? Ed Gein, say?

01:32:04.833 --> 01:32:07.202
Mr. Finkel,

01:32:07.302 --> 01:32:09.872
may I ask you something?

01:32:16.929 --> 01:32:19.465
Do you ever regret contacting him?

01:32:21.750 --> 01:32:23.552
What do you mean?

01:32:23.652 --> 01:32:28.256
Well, it seems to me that Christian Longo
has lost his liberty, but...

01:32:28.356 --> 01:32:30.126
hearing you read today,

01:32:30.226 --> 01:32:33.630
I was just wondering
what you might have lost as well.
