WEBVTT

00:07.841 --> 00:09.810
- HEY. SEE YOU LATER.
- HEY, DAD.

00:09.843 --> 00:12.046
BEFORE YOU GO,
CAN I ASK YOU SOMETHING?

00:12.080 --> 00:14.348
- OH, ASK YOUR MOTHER.
- WHY CAN'T I ASK YOU?

00:14.382 --> 00:16.184
WELL, BECAUSE WHATEVER
ANSWER I GIVE YOU,

00:16.217 --> 00:18.452
SHE'S GONNA TELL ME
IT'S THE WRONG ONE.

00:18.486 --> 00:21.555
WOW, DAD.
WHEN DID YOU BECOME
SO AFRAID OF MOM?

00:21.589 --> 00:23.491
I-- ASK YOUR MOTHER.

00:27.495 --> 00:31.299
HEY, MOM, CAN I ASK YOU
A QUESTION?

00:31.332 --> 00:35.069
- ( car alarm blaring )
- OKAY, WHY CAN'T PEOPLE LEARN
TO USE THEIR CAR ALARMS?

00:35.103 --> 00:38.439
- TURN IT OFF, JERK!
- UH, MOM, THAT JERK IS YOU.

00:38.472 --> 00:41.342
- WHAT?
- THAT'S YOUR CAR ALARM.

00:41.375 --> 00:43.544
OH, WELL, THAT'S
ENTIRELY DIFFERENT.

00:43.577 --> 00:47.215
- WHY IS IT GOING OFF?
- THAT'S WHY.

00:47.248 --> 00:50.451
- UH-OH.
- ( chuckles )

00:50.484 --> 00:53.221
CHARLIE'S GOING THROUGH
HER BUTTON-PUSHING PHASE.

00:53.254 --> 00:56.424
- ISN'T IT ADORABLE?
- YEAH YEAH, REAL CUTE BABY.

00:56.457 --> 00:59.527
- CAN WE GET BACK TO ME NOW?
- OKAY, HONEY, WHAT IS IT?

00:59.560 --> 01:01.595
THE KIDS AT SCHOOL ARE
TEASING ME AGAIN.

01:01.629 --> 01:04.632
- ABOUT YOUR HAIR?
- NO, ABOUT MY BIKE.

01:04.665 --> 01:07.435
- WHAT'S WRONG
WITH MY HAIR?
- NOTHING.

01:07.468 --> 01:09.537
IT WORKED WHEN
YOU WERE FIVE,
IT WORKS NOW.

01:11.539 --> 01:13.241
OKAY, NOW WHAT
ABOUT YOUR BIKE?

01:13.274 --> 01:15.176
IT'S LAME.
I NEED A NEW ONE.

01:15.209 --> 01:17.245
OH, A NEW BIKE, HUH?

01:17.278 --> 01:18.546
- ASK YOUR FATHER.
- REALLY?

01:18.579 --> 01:21.249
NO, I'M JUST KIDDING.

01:21.282 --> 01:23.651
YOU CAN'T HAVE
A NEW BIKE.

01:23.684 --> 01:26.520
EVERYONE KNOWS
YOUR BIKE IS A STATEMENT
OF WHO YOU ARE.

01:26.554 --> 01:29.457
MY BIKE SAYS
"THIS GUY IS A TOTAL GEEK."

01:29.490 --> 01:31.359
SAME THING
YOUR HAIRCUT SAYS.

01:33.361 --> 01:35.596
( rock music playing )

01:35.629 --> 01:37.231
* TODAY'S ALL BURNT TOAST

01:37.265 --> 01:38.566
* RUNNING LATE,
AND DAD SAYS *

01:38.599 --> 01:41.369
* HAS ANYBODY
SEEN MY LEFT SHOE? *

01:41.402 --> 01:43.537
* I CLOSE MY EYES,
TAKE A BITE *

01:43.571 --> 01:45.373
* GRAB A RIDE,
LAUGH OUT LOUD *

01:45.406 --> 01:47.908
* THERE IT IS
UP ON THE ROOF *

01:47.941 --> 01:51.345
* I'VE BEEN THERE,
I'VE SURVIVED *

01:51.379 --> 01:54.582
* SO JUST TAKE
MY ADVICE *

01:54.615 --> 01:56.550
* HANG IN THERE, BABY

01:56.584 --> 01:58.486
* THINGS ARE CRAZY

01:58.519 --> 02:01.422
* BUT I KNOW
YOUR FUTURE'S BRIGHT *

02:01.455 --> 02:03.357
* HANG IN THERE, BABY

02:03.391 --> 02:04.925
* THERE'S NO MAYBE

02:04.958 --> 02:07.661
* EVERYTHING
TURNS OUT ALL RIGHT *

02:07.695 --> 02:10.364
* YOUR LIFE
IS UP AND DOWN *

02:10.398 --> 02:13.534
* BUT TRUST ME,
IT COMES BACK AROUND *

02:13.567 --> 02:17.638
* YOU'RE GONNA LOVE
WHO YOU TURN OUT TO BE *

02:19.340 --> 02:21.675
* HANG IN THERE, BABY.

02:30.618 --> 02:34.188
HEY, HONEY.
WHAT YOU WORKING ON?

02:34.222 --> 02:35.489
OH, NOTHING.

02:38.359 --> 02:40.461
- DO YOU MIND?
I SAW THE WORD "MOM."

02:40.494 --> 02:44.198
OKAY, I'M WRITING A SCRIPT
FOR MY DRAMA CLASS.

02:44.232 --> 02:45.466
WE'RE SUPPOSED
TO SHOOT A SHORT FILM

02:45.499 --> 02:47.335
ABOUT AN IMPORTANT MOMENT
IN OUR LIVES.

02:47.368 --> 02:48.436
OOH OOH! WHICH MOMENT?

02:48.469 --> 02:50.238
I'VE BEEN INVOLVED
IN SO MANY.

02:50.271 --> 02:52.606
WELL, IT'S ABOUT THE DAY
YOU AND DAD SAT ME DOWN

02:52.640 --> 02:54.475
AND TOLD ME YOU WERE
EXPECTING CHARLIE.

02:54.508 --> 02:57.211
- CAN I READ IT?
- SURE, WHEN I'M FINISHED.

02:57.245 --> 02:58.479
NO, COME ON.
I'M REALLY EXCITED.

02:58.512 --> 03:00.948
- GIVE ME A SNEAK PEEK.
- ( sighs ) OKAY.

03:00.981 --> 03:03.384

"BOB"-- YAK YAK YAK.

03:03.417 --> 03:04.452
"TEDDY"-- BLAH BLAH BLAH.

03:04.485 --> 03:07.455
"AMY: TEDDY, WE NEED
TO TALK TO YOU."

03:07.488 --> 03:09.523
OH, THIS IS REALLY GOOD.

03:09.557 --> 03:12.260
MOM EXITS.

03:12.293 --> 03:13.494
WHERE DOES IT SAY THAT?
I DON'T SEE THAT.

03:13.527 --> 03:16.464
NO NO, IT DOESN'T.
I'M SAYING THAT.

03:20.534 --> 03:22.536
( doorbell rings )

03:22.570 --> 03:24.505
( chuckles )

03:24.538 --> 03:27.708
GUYS, I'D LIKE
YOU TO MEET MY NEW
GIRLFRIEND NINA.

03:27.741 --> 03:30.644
NINA, THIS IS
MY BEST FRIEND P.J....

03:30.678 --> 03:32.480
- HI.

03:32.513 --> 03:35.516
- NICE TO MEET YOU.
- OH, NICE TO MEET YOU TOO.

03:35.549 --> 03:38.252
COME ON IN.
EMMETT, WHEN DID
YOU GET A GIRLFRIEND?

03:38.286 --> 03:41.555
LIKE 20 MINUTES AGO.
I RUSHED RIGHT OVER
AS SOON AS IT HAPPENED.

03:41.589 --> 03:44.425
EMMETT HAS TOLD ME
SO MUCH ABOUT YOU.

03:44.458 --> 03:46.527
SHE TALKS LIKE THAT
ALL THE TIME.

03:46.560 --> 03:48.562
- SHE'S FROM SOUTH AMERICA.
- VENEZUELA.

03:48.596 --> 03:50.531
I THOUGHT YOU SAID
SOUTH AMERICA.

03:50.564 --> 03:52.800
EMMETT, VENEZUELA IS
IN SOUTH AMERICA.

03:52.833 --> 03:54.802
RIGHT?

03:54.835 --> 03:58.472
YEAH, THEY HAVE
TROUBLE WITH SUBJECTS
ENDING IN "-OGRAPHY."

03:58.506 --> 04:01.775
AND "-ATH."
AND "-IENCE."

04:01.809 --> 04:04.044
TEDDY, CAN I TALK
TO YOU FOR A SECOND?

04:04.077 --> 04:05.746
- SURE.
- I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

04:05.779 --> 04:07.548
OKAY.

04:07.581 --> 04:11.285
SO HOW LONG HAVE
YOU BEEN IN THE COUNTRY?

04:11.319 --> 04:14.455
- ONLY ONE DAY.
- THAT EXPLAINS HOW
YOU ENDED UP WITH EMMETT.

04:15.556 --> 04:18.459
( sighs )
SO, TEDDY,

04:18.492 --> 04:20.661
SINCE I HAVE
A GIRLFRIEND NOW

04:20.694 --> 04:22.830
THIS THING THAT'S
BEEN GOING ON BETWEEN US--

04:22.863 --> 04:25.666
MMM, THAT THING THAT
EXISTS ONLY IN YOUR HEAD?

04:25.699 --> 04:29.537
YEAH, THAT--
IT'S OVER.

04:29.570 --> 04:31.472
OKAY.

04:33.474 --> 04:35.643
THAT'S GOOD.
DENY THE PAIN.

04:35.676 --> 04:38.779
- NO TEARS?
- NO PROBLEM.

04:38.812 --> 04:42.750
- SO BRAVE.
- SO... EMMETT.

04:49.357 --> 04:52.460
DAD! DAD, DAD, QUICK!
GET IN HERE!

04:52.493 --> 04:54.462
MY BIKE IS GONE!
SOMEBODY STOLE IT!

04:54.495 --> 04:57.465
- WHAT?
- YEAH, THE GARAGE DOOR
IS WIDE OPEN.

04:57.498 --> 04:59.567
BUT I CLOSED IT
WHEN I CAME IN.

04:59.600 --> 05:01.569
WELL, SOMEBODY OPENED IT,

05:01.602 --> 05:03.704
AND I THINK I KNOW WHO.

05:04.872 --> 05:08.742
- CHARLIE DID IT.
- NO.

05:08.776 --> 05:11.379
YOU DID THAT!
SHE'S PUSHING
THE BUTTONS AGAIN.

05:11.412 --> 05:13.481
HANG ON, HANG ON.
HEY YOU.

05:13.514 --> 05:16.517
HOW DID CHARLIE EVEN GET
THE GARAGE DOOR REMOTE?

05:16.550 --> 05:19.753
WHO CARES?
WHEELIE IS GONE.

05:19.787 --> 05:22.490
- YOU CALLED
YOUR BIKE WHEELIE?
- I USED TO.

05:22.523 --> 05:26.594
( crying )
I LOVED THAT OLD BIKE.

05:26.627 --> 05:28.095
HEY HEY HEY HEY HEY.
IT'S OKAY.

05:28.128 --> 05:29.797
YOU KNOW WHAT?
WE'RE GONNA GET
YOU A NEW ONE.

05:29.830 --> 05:32.332
OKAY, I'LL BE
IN THE CAR.

05:38.572 --> 05:42.710
TEDDY HONEY,
YOUR SCRIPT IS TERRIFIC.

05:42.743 --> 05:45.446
- I LOVE IT.
- OH, MOM, I'M SO GLAD
YOU LIKE IT,

05:45.479 --> 05:47.147
'CAUSE I THOUGHT YOU WERE
GONNA BE CRITICAL.

05:47.180 --> 05:49.383
BUT YOU'RE NOT CRITICAL,
YOU'RE JUST REALLY SMART.

05:50.183 --> 05:51.919
OKAY, SO WHO'S IN IT?

05:51.952 --> 05:53.587
WHO'S PLAYING THE DUNCANS?

05:53.621 --> 05:54.788
OH, KIDS FROM
MY DRAMA CLASS.

05:54.822 --> 05:56.657
THIS ONE KID, WALTER,
IS PLAYING DAD.

05:56.690 --> 05:58.526
BLAH BLAH BLAH.
WHO'S PLAYING ME?

05:59.693 --> 06:01.562
I HAVEN'T CAST
THE MOM ROLE YET.

06:01.595 --> 06:03.163
I'M HAVING
AUDITIONS LATER.

06:03.196 --> 06:05.165
OH, OKAY.
WELL, IF YOU NEED ME
TO DO ANYTHING,

06:05.198 --> 06:07.535
JUST LET ME KNOW.
I COULD DO PROPS,

06:07.568 --> 06:09.570
COSTUMES
OR PLAY MOM--
WHATEVER.

06:09.603 --> 06:11.872
HERE WE GO.

06:11.905 --> 06:13.774
YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW
IF I'VE TOLD YOU THIS,

06:13.807 --> 06:16.944
BUT WHEN I WAS YOUNGER
I DID A LOT OF THEATER.

06:18.712 --> 06:20.648
REALLY? WHAT DID

"CAT ON A HOT TIN ROOF"

06:26.687 --> 06:28.689
PURR-FECT.

06:29.857 --> 06:32.159
AH. LOOK, MOM.

06:32.192 --> 06:33.761

06:36.597 --> 06:38.599
- I UNDERSTAND.
- THANKS.

06:39.767 --> 06:40.901
( clears throat )

06:40.934 --> 06:42.703
YOU KNOW WHAT
I FEEL LIKE?

06:42.736 --> 06:46.874
I FEEL ALL THE TIME LIKE
A CAT ON A HOT TIN ROOF.

06:49.009 --> 06:52.613
DAD! MOM'S BUGGING ME!

07:04.725 --> 07:06.460

07:17.871 --> 07:20.974
UH, I HOPE YOU DON'T THINK
I'M BEING TOO FORWARD,

07:21.008 --> 07:24.545
BUT I FIND YOU
VERY INTRIGUING.

07:24.578 --> 07:28.482
I FIND YOU STANDING
VERY CLOSE NOW.

07:28.516 --> 07:32.019
THIS IS MY NUMBER.
I HOPE YOU'LL USE IT.

07:32.052 --> 07:33.987
DON'T YOU ALREADY
HAVE A BOYFRIEND?

07:34.021 --> 07:37.791
NO, BUT I'M
HOPING TO. CIAO.

07:38.926 --> 07:40.628
CIAO?

07:40.661 --> 07:43.797
OH, NO, SHE ALREADY HAS
A NICKNAME FOR ME.

07:50.704 --> 07:52.740
- HI, HONEY.

07:52.773 --> 07:54.875
WHY IS THERE A NEW BIKE
IN THE GARAGE?

07:54.908 --> 07:57.911
GABE'S BIKE GOT STOLEN.
POOR KID WAS CRUSHED.

07:57.945 --> 08:02.249
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
HE HATED HIS OLD BIKE.

08:02.282 --> 08:04.718
- WHEELIE?
- YES, WEALLY.

08:05.953 --> 08:08.656
ARE WE TALKING
LIKE THIS FOR A WEASON?

08:08.689 --> 08:11.825
NO, WHEELIE IS WHAT
HE CALLED HIS BIKE.

08:11.859 --> 08:13.994
YESTERDAY HE CALLED
HIS BIKE LAME

08:14.027 --> 08:16.029
AND THEN ASKED ME
FOR A NEW ONE.

08:21.769 --> 08:22.936
HUH.

08:24.638 --> 08:25.906
KINDA SUSPICIOUS,
DON'T YOU THINK?

08:25.939 --> 08:27.775
YEAH.

08:27.808 --> 08:29.943
IT WEALLY IS.

08:33.781 --> 08:37.317
HEY, DO YOU KNOW
HOW THEY SAY BANANAS
IN VENEZUELA?

08:37.350 --> 08:39.853
BANANAS.

08:41.589 --> 08:44.024
DO YOU KNOW WHAT GIRLS
FROM VENEZUELA CALL THE GUY

08:44.057 --> 08:46.594
THEY SECRETLY
WANT TO DATE BEHIND
THEIR BEST FRIEND'S BACK?

08:47.661 --> 08:49.863
CIAO.

08:50.864 --> 08:52.700
WAIT. WHAT?

08:52.733 --> 08:54.668
NINA FLIRTED WITH ME
AT SCHOOL TODAY.

08:54.702 --> 08:56.770
- NO, SHE DIDN'T.
- DID TOO.

08:56.804 --> 08:58.038
OKAY, MAYBE YOU DIDN'T
UNDERSTAND HER.

08:58.071 --> 09:00.941
I UNDERSTAND ENGLISH.

09:00.974 --> 09:04.011
I'VE BEEN SPEAKING IT
SINCE I WAS SEVEN.

09:05.813 --> 09:06.980
I THINK YOU'RE
MAKING THINGS UP.

09:07.014 --> 09:10.718
DUDE, SHE SAID,
"I FIND YOU INTRIGUING."

09:10.751 --> 09:14.788
NOW I DON'T SPEAK SPANISH,
BUT THAT HAS GOT
TO BE A COME-ON.

09:17.124 --> 09:19.727
ALL RIGHTY.
ARE YOU GUYS READY?

09:19.760 --> 09:24.131
HEY. I THOUGHT
YOU KIDS MIGHT LIKE
SOME REFRESHMENTS.

09:24.164 --> 09:27.801
THANK YOU, HONEY.
I'M SO LUCKY TO HAVE YOU.

09:27.835 --> 09:30.604
( sighs )

09:30.638 --> 09:33.006
UH, MOM, THAT'S WALTER.
HE'S PLAYING DAD.

09:33.040 --> 09:35.609
PLEASE,
CALL ME BOB.

09:35.643 --> 09:37.645
IT'LL HELP ME
STAY IN CHARACTER.

09:37.678 --> 09:39.847
TAKE YOUR ARM AWAY, BOB.

09:39.880 --> 09:43.617
AND THIS IS KIMMY.
SHE'S PLAYING ME.

09:43.651 --> 09:45.385
QUESTION ABOUT
MY CHARACTER:

09:45.418 --> 09:47.020
WHY DID YOU
NAME HER TEDDY?

09:47.054 --> 09:49.623
WELL, WE JUST REALLY
LIKED THE NAME.

09:49.657 --> 09:51.625
( mimics explosion )

09:51.659 --> 09:53.661
THAT WAS YOU
BLOWING MY MIND.

09:57.164 --> 09:58.932
SHE WAS THE ONLY ONE
WHO TRIED OUT.

10:00.200 --> 10:02.002
WELL, HAVE YOU FOUND
A MOM YET?

10:02.035 --> 10:04.404
OH, NO, ALL THE AMY CANDIDATES
ARE OUT ON THE PORCH.

10:04.437 --> 10:06.874
OH, OKAY.
WHATEVER.

10:06.907 --> 10:08.909
I WASN'T EVEN THINKING
ABOUT THAT, REALLY.

10:08.942 --> 10:11.812
IS THAT THE MAIL I HEAR?
I'M JUST GONNA GO CHECK
AND FIND OUT.

10:14.948 --> 10:18.185
SORRY, GIRLS,
THE VIDEO SHOOT'S
BEEN CANCELED.

10:18.218 --> 10:21.689

OKAY, WELL,

10:42.976 --> 10:44.812

10:54.454 --> 10:56.123
OKAY, HERE WE GO.

10:56.156 --> 10:58.091

11:01.461 --> 11:03.764
- WAITING FOR THAT WOMAN.

11:12.072 --> 11:14.241
( whispers )
MOM, WHY DID YOU CHANGE?

11:14.274 --> 11:17.811
- THE SCRIPT SAYS
AMY'S IN SCRUBS.
- OH, HONEY,

11:17.845 --> 11:19.246
I LEARNED
IN COLLEGE THEATER

11:19.279 --> 11:21.681
THAT THE SCRIPT IS
REALLY JUST AN OUTLINE.

11:23.283 --> 11:26.453
OKAY. ALL RIGHT,
EVERYONE, HERE WE GO.

11:26.486 --> 11:28.055
BOB AND AMY,
YOU'RE ON THE COUCH.

11:28.088 --> 11:30.190
TEDDY ENTERS FROM OVER THERE.
NOW REMEMBER, GUYS,

11:30.223 --> 11:32.793
THIS IS JUST A REHEARSAL
SO USE YOUR SCRIPTS.

11:32.826 --> 11:34.795
AND ACTION.

11:34.828 --> 11:37.264
"TEDDY, CAN YOU
COME HERE A MINUTE?"

11:37.297 --> 11:39.232
"TEDDY CROSSES
TO THE COUCH, NERVOUS.

11:39.266 --> 11:41.068
'AM I IN TROUBLE'--
QUESTION MARK."

11:42.535 --> 11:45.205
NO NO NO, KIMMY,
JUST THE LINES, HONEY.

11:45.238 --> 11:47.975
NOT THE OTHER STUFF,
OKAY?

11:48.008 --> 11:49.777
AND ACTION.

11:49.810 --> 11:52.479
"TEDDY, WE NEED
TO TALK TO YOU."

11:52.512 --> 11:55.082
"AM I IN TROUBLE?"

11:55.115 --> 11:58.018
"WELL, I'LL JUST SAY IT.

11:58.051 --> 12:00.788
- YOUR MOTHER'S
GONNA HAVE A BABY."
- OKAY, CAN WE STOP?

12:00.821 --> 12:02.890
CAN WE STOP?
I'M SORRY.

12:02.923 --> 12:05.258
THESE WORDS--
THEY JUST DON'T FIT
INTO MY MOUTH COMFORTABLY.

12:07.094 --> 12:09.296
BUT IT'S WHAT HAPPENED.
IT'S EXACTLY WHAT YOU SAID

12:09.329 --> 12:11.799
THE DAY YOU WERE SUPPOSED
TO BE WEARING SCRUBS.

12:13.934 --> 12:15.502
OKAY, VALID POINT,
BUT DO WE WANT TO
MAKE IT REAL

12:15.535 --> 12:18.105
OR DO WE WANT
TO MAKE IT GOOD?

12:18.138 --> 12:20.808
I WANT TO MAKE IT
BEFORE MY BATTERY DIES.

12:23.811 --> 12:27.114
YEAH. WELL,
THAT NEW BIKE
SURE IS A BEAUTY.

12:27.147 --> 12:29.516
- SURE IS, DAD.
- ( both chuckle )

12:29.549 --> 12:32.820
- ALL RIGHT.
HAVE FUN.
- OKAY.

12:33.887 --> 12:35.555
- GABE, BEFORE YOU GO...
- YEAH?

12:35.588 --> 12:37.190
- ...ONE QUICK QUESTION.
- MM-HMM.

12:37.224 --> 12:39.326
YOU KNOW THAT GARAGE DOOR
REMOTE THAT CHARLIE HAD?

12:39.359 --> 12:42.095
- MM-HMM.
- HOW DO YOU THINK SHE GOT
THAT DOWN FROM THE CUPBOARD?

12:43.964 --> 12:47.801
- MAYBE YOU SHOULD
ASK CHARLIE.
- YEAH, WELL,

12:47.835 --> 12:51.204
- YOU KNOW I CAN'T DO THAT.
- OH, BECAUSE SHE CAN'T
TALK YET.

12:51.238 --> 12:52.940
- YEAH.
- YEAH, THAT IS A BUMMER.

12:52.973 --> 12:54.574
YEAH, IT SURE IS.

12:54.607 --> 12:56.076
ALL RIGHT. YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

12:56.109 --> 12:58.145
OKAY.

12:58.178 --> 13:00.580
YOU KNOW WHAT?
JUST ONE MORE THING.

13:00.613 --> 13:02.349
MM-HMM.

13:02.382 --> 13:04.818
YOU KNOW,
I DON'T EVEN THINK

13:04.852 --> 13:06.586
THAT REMOTE WORKS
FROM THE KITCHEN
WHERE CHARLIE WAS.

13:06.619 --> 13:08.588
DAD, WHAT ARE
YOU TRYING TO SAY?

13:08.621 --> 13:10.257
ARE YOU ACCUSING ME
OF SOMETHING?

13:10.290 --> 13:12.860
NO, I JUST WANNA KNOW
WHEN YOU'RE GONNA BE BACK.

13:12.893 --> 13:16.163
OH, HALF AN HOUR.
CAN I GO NOW?

13:16.196 --> 13:17.364
OF COURSE YOU CAN, GABE.

13:17.397 --> 13:19.867
YOU'VE ALWAYS
BEEN FREE TO GO.

13:22.602 --> 13:24.804
OKAY.

13:31.011 --> 13:33.847
OKAY OKAY,
THERE SHE IS.

13:33.881 --> 13:36.583
NOW I'M GOING TO PROVE
TO YOU THAT SHE LIKES ME

13:36.616 --> 13:39.286
- AND NOT YOU.
- OKAY. OKAY.

13:41.054 --> 13:42.389
- HI.
- HI.

13:42.422 --> 13:44.124
- HI.
- HI.

13:44.157 --> 13:46.393
SO FAR IT'S A TIE.

13:46.426 --> 13:49.930
OKAY, I KNOW WE BOTH HAVE
A LOT TO OFFER,

13:49.963 --> 13:52.032
BUT YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO CHOOSE BETWEEN US.

13:52.065 --> 13:53.433
OH, I CHOOSE P.J.

13:56.069 --> 13:57.404
OKAY, LET'S TRY
THAT AGAIN.

13:57.437 --> 13:59.606
AND REMEMBER IT'S
A MULTIPLE-CHOICE QUESTION.

13:59.639 --> 14:02.409
MY CHOICE IS
STILL P.J.

14:02.442 --> 14:04.878
I'M SORRY, I CAN'T
GO OUT WITH YOU.

14:04.912 --> 14:07.948
I WOULDN'T
DO THAT TO EMMETT.
PALS BEFORE GALS.

14:07.981 --> 14:10.417
- THANKS, MAN.
- YOU'D DO THE SAME
FOR ME, RIGHT?

14:10.450 --> 14:12.285
YEAH, LET'S GO
WITH THAT.

14:12.319 --> 14:15.088
WAIT A MINUTE.
I KNOW WHAT'S
GOING ON HERE.

14:15.122 --> 14:18.058
- YOU THINK I'M NINA.
- YOU'RE NOT?

14:18.091 --> 14:21.461
NO! I'M TINA.
THAT'S NINA.

14:26.133 --> 14:28.635
( both laugh ) TWINS!

14:28.668 --> 14:30.337
WAIT. WHAT ARE
WE DOING?

14:40.380 --> 14:42.415
AND THEN I COULD SAY,

14:42.449 --> 14:46.119
"TEDDY GIRL,
MAMA'S HAVING
A BABY CHILD!"

14:47.988 --> 14:50.457
RIGHT? RIGHT?
ISN'T THAT BETTER?

14:50.490 --> 14:52.159
DOESN'T IT
MAKE MORE SENSE

14:52.192 --> 14:54.894
THAT AMY WOULD
TELL TEDDY ABOUT THE BABY?

14:57.730 --> 15:01.301
"MAMA'S HAVING
A BABY CHILD"?

15:01.334 --> 15:03.303
WELL, TEDDY,
I'M JUST TRYING TO FIND

15:03.336 --> 15:04.938
THE EMOTIONAL TRUTH
TO THE PIECE.

15:04.972 --> 15:07.240
NO THANK YOU.

15:07.274 --> 15:09.709
OKAY, FINE.
YOU WANT ME TO BE
A ROBOT, I'LL BE A ROBOT.

15:09.742 --> 15:11.711
I'LL BE A ROBOT.

15:11.744 --> 15:14.247
( robotic voice )
AM I IN TROUBLE?

15:15.983 --> 15:18.185
NO. NO NO NO NO NO.

15:18.218 --> 15:20.320
NOBODY'S A ROBOT.
WE'RE DOING THE SCRIPT
AS WRITTEN.

15:20.353 --> 15:23.356
OKAY, PLACES EVERYONE.

15:23.390 --> 15:25.225
- ( beeps )
- AND ACTION.

15:25.258 --> 15:27.194
TEDDY, CAN YOU
COME HERE A MINUTE?

15:27.227 --> 15:28.996
( melodramatically )
AM I IN TROUBLE?

15:31.264 --> 15:32.699
TEDDY, WE NEED
TO TALK TO YOU.

15:32.732 --> 15:34.401
WELL, I'LL JUST SAY IT--

15:34.434 --> 15:36.103
YOUR MOTHER'S GONNA
HAVE A BABY.

15:36.136 --> 15:37.537
A WHAT?

15:39.406 --> 15:41.274
A BABY.
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE

15:41.308 --> 15:42.509
A NEW LITTLE
BROTHER OR SISTER.

15:42.542 --> 15:45.245
- OH!
- NOW WHAT ARE
YOU DOING?

15:45.278 --> 15:47.247
I JUST FELT
THE BABY KICK.

15:47.280 --> 15:49.149
- ( gasps )
- NO. NO NO NO.

15:49.182 --> 15:52.119
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.
THE BABY DOESN'T
HAVE FEET YET.

15:52.152 --> 15:54.387
OKAY. YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M JUST TRYING

15:54.421 --> 15:56.723
TO FIGURE OUT THE MIX
OF EMOTIONS THAT I WAS
FEELING THAT DAY.

15:56.756 --> 15:59.126
YOU KNOW,
THE EXCITEMENT,
THE CONFUSION,

15:59.159 --> 16:02.029
THE FEAR,
THE HORMONES.

16:06.566 --> 16:10.003
YEAH, DO YOU KNOW WHAT
I WAS FEELING THAT DAY?

16:10.037 --> 16:11.504
IT WAS "WHY ARE YOU
HAVING ANOTHER BABY?

16:11.538 --> 16:14.374
YOU BARELY HAVE TIME
FOR THE THREE KIDS
YOU HAVE NOW."

16:21.581 --> 16:24.417
WAS THAT IN THE SCRIPT?
BECAUSE I'M LOST.

16:27.054 --> 16:28.788
TEDDY HONEY,

16:28.821 --> 16:30.523
WHAT WAS THAT?

16:30.557 --> 16:33.426
I'M SORRY, MOM.
I SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID THAT.

16:33.460 --> 16:35.328
WELL, IS THAT
REALLY HOW YOU FELT?

16:35.362 --> 16:37.164
WERE YOU REALLY MAD
THAT WE WERE HAVING
ANOTHER BABY?

16:37.197 --> 16:40.267
- YEAH, I KINDA WAS.
- WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY SOMETHING?

16:40.300 --> 16:42.102
MOM, WHAT WAS
I SUPPOSED TO SAY?

16:42.135 --> 16:44.337
CHARLIE WAS ON THE WAY.
YOU WERE ALL SO EXCITED.

16:44.371 --> 16:47.074
EXCITED? I DIDN'T KNOW
HOW WE WERE GONNA
MAKE IT ALL WORK.

16:47.107 --> 16:49.276
- I WAS TERRIFIED.
- REALLY? 'CAUSE YOU
DIDN'T SHOW IT.

16:49.309 --> 16:52.145
THAT'S BECAUSE I'M
A REALLY GREAT ACTRESS.

16:56.316 --> 16:59.186
COME HERE.
SIT DOWN.

17:00.320 --> 17:02.489
DO YOU STILL
FEEL THAT WAY,

17:02.522 --> 17:04.324
LIKE WE DON'T HAVE
ENOUGH TIME FOR YOU?

17:04.357 --> 17:07.060
ACTUALLY,
TODAY I THOUGHT
MAYBE YOU HAD

17:07.094 --> 17:09.496
A LITTLE BIT
TOO MUCH TIME FOR ME.

17:11.231 --> 17:13.066
NO. SERIOUSLY,

17:13.100 --> 17:14.834
I DON'T KNOW
HOW YOU'RE DOING IT,

17:14.867 --> 17:16.536
BUT YOU GUYS
ARE DOING A GREAT JOB.

17:16.569 --> 17:19.072
WELL, THAT'S BECAUSE
WE'RE NOT DOING IT ALONE,

17:19.106 --> 17:23.343
AND ONE OF THE BIG
REASONS IT WORKS IS YOU.

17:23.376 --> 17:26.179
THE BOYS HELP OUT TOO.

17:26.213 --> 17:28.215
BUT YOU'RE RIGHT,
IT'S MOSTLY ME.

17:28.248 --> 17:30.183
( laughs )

17:30.217 --> 17:32.352
LOOK, TEDDY.
IN THE FUTURE,

17:32.385 --> 17:34.354
IF EVER YOU'RE FEELING
SOMETHING, YOU'VE GOT
TO TELL ME, OKAY?

17:34.387 --> 17:35.855
COME HERE.
COME HERE.

17:35.888 --> 17:38.191
I WANT US TO ALWAYS
BE HONEST WITH EACH OTHER.

17:38.225 --> 17:39.859
OKAY, I'LL BE
HONEST WITH YOU.

17:39.892 --> 17:42.295
SAY THE LINES AS WRITTEN
OR YOU'RE FIRED.

17:42.329 --> 17:44.664
( gasps ) AWW.

17:50.203 --> 17:51.871
( beeps )

17:51.904 --> 17:54.107
( whirring )

18:08.188 --> 18:10.123
WHAT'S THE MATTER, GABE?

18:10.157 --> 18:13.126
- UM, DAD--
- ( chuckles )
ARE YOU OKAY?

18:13.160 --> 18:15.128
YOU LOOK SHOOK UP.

18:15.162 --> 18:18.598
- WHEELIE'S BACK.
- I KNOW! ISN'T IT GREAT?

18:18.631 --> 18:20.900
YAY. UM...

18:20.933 --> 18:22.202
HOW DID YOU FIND HIM?

18:22.235 --> 18:23.670
OH, I CAME HOME
FROM WORK,

18:23.703 --> 18:25.272
I SAW THAT KID JAKE
ON YOUR BIKE,

18:25.305 --> 18:27.440
SO I CALLED THE COPS
AND THEY ARRESTED HIM.

18:27.474 --> 18:29.276
THEY ARRESTED JAKE?

18:29.309 --> 18:30.910
BUT HE'S JUST A KID.

18:30.943 --> 18:33.213
OOH, HE WON'T BE
WHEN HE GETS OUT.

18:35.582 --> 18:39.419
WHAT?
WHAT'S WRONG, SON?

18:39.452 --> 18:40.887
SOMETHING BOTHERING YOU?

18:40.920 --> 18:43.456
UM... NO.

18:43.490 --> 18:46.226
NO? WELL, SOMETHING'S
BOTHERING ME,

18:46.259 --> 18:48.328
BECAUSE HERE'S WHAT
I THINK REALLY HAPPENED.

18:49.729 --> 18:52.565
FIRST, YOU SOLD
YOUR BIKE TO JAKE

18:52.599 --> 18:55.235
AND THEN
YOU POCKETED THE MONEY.

18:57.370 --> 18:59.906
THEN YOU OPENED
THE GARAGE DOOR...

18:59.939 --> 19:02.475
- ( beeps )
- ...USING THE KEYPAD.

19:02.509 --> 19:05.312
FINALLY, YOU GRABBED
THE REMOTE

19:05.345 --> 19:06.913
FROM THE KITCHEN CABINET

19:06.946 --> 19:09.516
AND YOU PLANTED IT
ON CHARLIE.

19:13.586 --> 19:17.190
INTERESTING THEORY,
BUT IT DOESN'T
PROVE A THING.

19:18.491 --> 19:20.927
YOU'RE RIGHT.
YOU'RE RIGHT.

19:20.960 --> 19:24.464
I DIDN'T HAVE
ANY HARD PROOF,

19:24.497 --> 19:28.335
BUT I KEPT
THINKING, THINKING

19:28.368 --> 19:30.503
AND THINKING

19:30.537 --> 19:32.639
AND THEN A BELL WENT OFF.

19:32.672 --> 19:34.674
( doorbell rings )

19:36.243 --> 19:38.211
- IS GABE HERE?
- NO.

19:38.245 --> 19:40.547
TELL HIM JAKE WANTS
HIS $10 BACK.

19:40.580 --> 19:43.182
THIS BIKE IS
A PIECE OF JUNK.

19:46.786 --> 19:51.324
AND THAT'S WHEN
ALL THE PIECES
FELL INTO PLACE.

19:53.593 --> 19:55.695
ALL RIGHT,
YOU GOT ME.

19:55.728 --> 19:57.230
NOW WHAT HAPPENS?

19:59.466 --> 20:02.235
ASK YOUR MOTHER.

20:09.709 --> 20:11.744
BACK FROM
THE BIKE STORE.

20:11.778 --> 20:15.014
CHARLIE, YOUR BROTHER
HAS SOMETHING HE WOULD
LIKE TO SAY TO YOU.

20:15.047 --> 20:16.649
GO AHEAD, GABE.

20:18.518 --> 20:21.488
CHARLIE, I'M SORRY
I TRIED TO FRAME YOU.

20:21.521 --> 20:24.757
AW. REMEMBER
THE FIRST TIME
I SAID THAT TO YOU?

20:24.791 --> 20:27.994
LIKE IT WAS
YESTERDAY.

20:28.027 --> 20:32.031
AND NOW HERE IS
A LITTLE I'M-SORRY PRESENT
FROM YOUR BROTHER.

20:32.064 --> 20:34.267
OKAY, BRING IT IN.

20:34.301 --> 20:36.303
- OH.
- YAY!

20:36.336 --> 20:39.272
YEAH, WE EXCHANGED
GABE'S NEW BIKE
FOR THIS ONE.

20:39.306 --> 20:40.473
( laughs )

20:43.476 --> 20:46.746
- Thank you.
- Amy: You're welcome.

20:46.779 --> 20:49.015
( laughs )

20:49.048 --> 20:52.519
Charlie, there you are
on your very first bike.

20:52.552 --> 20:56.323
Yeah yeah.
Teddy girl,

20:56.356 --> 20:58.725
Mama's baby child has
a new tricycle!

20:58.758 --> 21:02.362
It's pink and red
stickers on it.ttle

21:04.597 --> 21:08.301
Teddy:
your very first spotlight.ing

21:08.335 --> 21:10.737
Good luck, Charlie.

21:17.076 --> 21:19.546
I FEEL SO BAD.
I JUST CAN'T TELL
THEM APART.

21:19.579 --> 21:22.449
- IT IS HARD.
- AND I DON'T WANT
TO OFFEND THEM.

21:22.482 --> 21:25.652
WELL, YOU JUST HAVE
TO FIND ONE LITTLE THING
THAT'S DIFFERENT.

21:25.685 --> 21:27.687
- ( sport announcer
speaking on TV )
- ( crowd cheering )

21:32.425 --> 21:34.327
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

21:34.361 --> 21:37.797
I HAVE NO IDEA,
AND I'M MARRIED
TO ONE OF THEM.

21:39.098 --> 21:40.800
HEY, UH, DADS,

21:40.833 --> 21:43.336
CAN I HAVE FIVE BUCKS?

21:43.370 --> 21:46.339
( sighs )

21:47.774 --> 21:51.844
HUH. I LOVE
( laughs ) DADS.

21:51.878 --> 21:54.714
UNBELIEVABLE.
WE'LL NEVER FIGURE IT OUT.

21:55.682 --> 21:57.617
Amy:
WAIT. WAIT.

21:57.650 --> 22:01.320
YUP, THAT'S MY GUY.

22:03.390 --> 22:05.658
( theme music plays )
