WEBVTT

00:18.540 --> 00:20.411
- Oracle, it's Huntress.
Come in.

00:20.455 --> 00:22.022
- Huntress, the comms
are barely functional.

00:22.065 --> 00:23.066
- Barbara, can you hear me?

00:23.110 --> 00:24.154
- I need more time.

00:24.198 --> 00:25.590
- The wave's coming
too quickly.

00:25.634 --> 00:27.505
You're gonna have
to evac right now.

00:27.549 --> 00:29.203
- I'm sending all relevant
data before the wave hits.

00:29.246 --> 00:32.162
- Oracle?
Oracle, please answer me.

00:32.206 --> 00:33.555
- Sending all relevant data...

00:54.576 --> 00:57.274
- We have only located four
of the seven Paragons

00:57.318 --> 00:58.971
needed to save the multiverse.

00:59.015 --> 01:00.930
- We could find the last
three if--

01:00.973 --> 01:04.151
- Hey, it's uh--repairing
a Paragon Detector, okay?

01:04.194 --> 01:05.195
It's complex stuff.

01:06.240 --> 01:08.198
- Someone call for backup?

01:08.242 --> 01:10.331
- Iris.
- Cisco, thank goodness.

01:10.374 --> 01:12.072
I need another
genius intellect, stat.

01:12.115 --> 01:13.160
- That's why I'm here.

01:13.203 --> 01:15.249
And that
is a super doppelganger,

01:15.292 --> 01:16.859
which is super weird.

01:16.902 --> 01:19.427
- Holy all-star squadron.

01:19.470 --> 01:22.169
Hi, hi, how are ya?
Ralph Dibny, Elongated Man.

01:22.212 --> 01:23.431
Ready to help kick butt.

01:23.474 --> 01:25.302
- Ignore him.
It's his first crossover.

01:25.346 --> 01:26.999
- Listen, the antimatter wave

01:27.043 --> 01:28.784
is still ripping its way
across the multiverse.

01:28.827 --> 01:30.612
We have to get everyone we can
to safety.

01:30.655 --> 01:32.135
- Calculations still show
that Earth-1

01:32.179 --> 01:33.832
will be the last place
for the wave to hit.

01:33.876 --> 01:35.660
- I just heard from
Alex and Brainy on Earth-1.

01:35.704 --> 01:37.836
Everyone we saved from Earth-38
is still accounted for.

01:37.880 --> 01:40.143
- Then we should bring as many
people to Earth-1 as we can

01:40.187 --> 01:41.275
in the time being.

01:41.318 --> 01:42.754
- Let's get
a rescue team together,

01:42.798 --> 01:44.191
save who we can
across the multiverse.

01:44.234 --> 01:45.496
I can use my psychic abilities

01:45.540 --> 01:46.932
to stay in connection
with the Waverider.

01:46.976 --> 01:48.325
- And I'll go as well.

01:48.369 --> 01:49.935
- Well, parallel Earth Rory
still has Jonathan,

01:49.979 --> 01:53.374
so I'll run comms
and keep everyone updated.

01:53.417 --> 01:54.723
- Supergirl?
- I'll stay here.

01:54.766 --> 01:57.291
We have to find a way
to get our world back.

01:58.901 --> 02:01.208
- Hey, I think we did it.
I think we fixed it.

02:05.560 --> 02:07.257
- Guys,
we already know all this.

02:07.301 --> 02:09.955
- It's buffering,
so maybe a little patience.

02:12.219 --> 02:15.265
- Huh.
Why am I not surprised?

02:15.309 --> 02:17.659
- That's new.

02:17.702 --> 02:19.574
- Uh, who the hell is that guy?

02:19.617 --> 02:22.011
- Dr. Ryan Choi,
physics professor

02:22.054 --> 02:24.405
at Ivy Town University
on our Earth.

02:24.448 --> 02:26.320
- Well, I guess
we know our next stop.

02:26.363 --> 02:27.625
Ray, Ralph?

02:27.669 --> 02:28.931
- Ivy Town.
It's my old stomping grounds.

02:28.974 --> 02:29.932
Let's go.

02:29.975 --> 02:32.282
- With all
the Paragons identified,

02:32.326 --> 02:33.762
our next priority
is determining

02:33.805 --> 02:35.372
how to stop
the antimatter wave.

02:35.416 --> 02:37.287
Sorry to interrupt,

02:37.331 --> 02:39.071
but Mr. Diggle has arrived.

02:39.115 --> 02:41.030
- How could you let
this happen, Sara?

02:41.073 --> 02:42.118
You, of all people?

02:42.162 --> 02:43.119
- It's complicated.

02:43.163 --> 02:45.426
- It's not complicated.

02:45.469 --> 02:46.731
I wasn't there
when he needed me.

02:46.775 --> 02:48.733
- Dig, we are working
on bringing him back

02:48.777 --> 02:50.866
the same way that
he brought me back, remember?

02:50.909 --> 02:52.476
- You're talking about
a trip to Purgatory.

02:52.520 --> 02:54.565
- Yes.
- Fine, count me in.

02:54.609 --> 02:56.480
- And there's--

02:56.524 --> 02:58.613
There's something else.

02:58.656 --> 03:01.224
Dig, it's Lyla.
She's--

03:01.268 --> 03:02.965
she's gone missing.

03:03.008 --> 03:05.228
- What?
- Nobody saw her leave.

03:05.272 --> 03:08.362
She was there one minute
and gone the next.

03:08.405 --> 03:10.712
- But she has the ability
to teleport,

03:10.755 --> 03:12.017
so she--

03:12.061 --> 03:13.323
- So there are now
infinite possibilities

03:13.367 --> 03:15.107
for Lyla's location.

03:15.151 --> 03:17.675
- You.
Listen to me.

03:17.719 --> 03:22.419
I am not losing
Oliver and Lyla.

03:22.463 --> 03:26.510
So cut the crap and tell me
how the hell do I find my wife?

03:26.554 --> 03:29.034
- You heard him.
Where is she?

03:29.078 --> 03:32.299
- Harbinger could very well
be with my adversary...

03:34.475 --> 03:36.520
The Anti-Monitor.

03:42.526 --> 03:45.312
- The Anti-Monitor--

03:45.355 --> 03:47.009
is that, uh, set in stone,

03:47.052 --> 03:48.663
or can we workshop that
a little bit?

03:48.706 --> 03:51.187
- This is why I have been
preparing all of you--

03:51.231 --> 03:53.494
testing and pushing you
to your limits.

03:53.537 --> 03:55.539
I needed your courage,
your honor,

03:55.583 --> 03:56.975
your strength of will,

03:57.019 --> 03:59.282
even the truth
of your convictions--

03:59.326 --> 04:00.805
everything that makes you

04:00.849 --> 04:02.633
the greatest heroes
on this Earth or any other,

04:02.677 --> 04:04.418
because that's
what it will take

04:04.461 --> 04:05.636
to defeat our opponent.

04:05.680 --> 04:07.638
- And what exactly
does this guy want?

04:07.682 --> 04:09.074
- To eliminate the multiverse

04:09.118 --> 04:11.120
and replace it
with another universe.

04:11.163 --> 04:12.339
- One that he can control--

04:12.382 --> 04:14.210
just like every other
megalomaniac.

04:14.254 --> 04:15.864
- I should've foreseen

04:15.907 --> 04:18.432
my connection with Harbinger
could be perverted to his ends.

04:18.475 --> 04:20.129
- Should have?

04:20.172 --> 04:21.826
Just tell us
how to get her back.

04:21.870 --> 04:24.133
- I want to find her just
as much as the rest of you,

04:24.176 --> 04:26.918
but I cannot rewrite
what has already been written.

04:26.962 --> 04:29.660
I can only attempt
to save what remains.

04:43.674 --> 04:45.676
- You know what to do
to get Oliver's soul back.

04:45.720 --> 04:47.461
I'll watch over his body

04:47.504 --> 04:50.115
and I promise you I will
keep you updated on Harbinger.

04:50.159 --> 04:52.248
- Copy that.

04:53.554 --> 04:55.033
- Cisco, maybe you should
call Kamilla back?

04:55.077 --> 04:56.600
- No, no, no.
That wasn't a phone call.

04:56.644 --> 04:58.602
I'm triangulating
anti-matter wave particles

04:58.646 --> 05:00.169
on the Earth that are left.

05:00.212 --> 05:01.518
- Why?

05:01.562 --> 05:03.346
- I'm trying to locate
the source of the wave

05:03.390 --> 05:05.609
and according to this,
it's hidden

05:05.653 --> 05:08.917
in a subterranean region
right in our own backyard.

05:08.960 --> 05:10.875
Meet me in the cargo bay
in five.

05:14.444 --> 05:16.272
- Cisco Ramon.

05:18.492 --> 05:19.667
Didn't I just leave you?

05:19.710 --> 05:21.233
- You are not a Paragon,

05:21.277 --> 05:24.019
but you do have a purpose.

05:24.062 --> 05:26.282
Vibe must live again.

05:26.326 --> 05:28.980
- No.

05:29.024 --> 05:32.767
No, my powers are gone
and there's a reason for that.

05:32.810 --> 05:35.726
- You must answer the call
whether you wish to or not.

05:35.770 --> 05:37.467
- Okay, maybe
you didn't hear me

05:37.511 --> 05:40.296
under those voluminous
mutton chops of yours.

05:42.080 --> 05:46.128
- Now go.
Serve your higher purpose.

05:54.441 --> 05:57.531
- Are you still sure
you want me to go?

05:57.574 --> 05:59.010
- Yeah.

05:59.054 --> 06:02.579
Go find Ryan Choi
and hurry back.

06:17.551 --> 06:19.422
- Where did Barry race off to?

06:19.466 --> 06:20.989
- Perimeter search--

06:21.032 --> 06:22.773
make sure this isn't a trap
set up by the Anti-Monitor.

06:22.817 --> 06:24.471
That name makes me wanna barf.

06:24.514 --> 06:27.038
- Nice to have you back, Vibe.

06:27.082 --> 06:29.345
- Let's just get
to Nash's work site.

06:29.389 --> 06:30.868
- Right this way.

06:31.695 --> 06:33.436
Huh.
That's new.

06:33.480 --> 06:36.308
- We gotta get in there.

06:37.614 --> 06:40.138
Who's there?

06:40.182 --> 06:42.619
- Nash, is that you?

06:42.663 --> 06:46.144
I am no longer Nash, I am...

06:46.188 --> 06:47.581
Pariah.

06:47.624 --> 06:49.887
And I'm here to bear witness.

06:49.931 --> 06:51.454
- To what?

06:51.498 --> 06:53.413
- Tragedy.

06:56.633 --> 06:59.419
- Mm-hmm, new name,

06:59.462 --> 07:00.681
new suit--

07:00.724 --> 07:02.726
guess no one's consulting me
anymore, huh?

07:02.770 --> 07:04.772
- Wait, what exactly happened?

07:04.815 --> 07:08.515
- I searched these tunnels
as Nash for Mar Novu

07:08.558 --> 07:11.300
to kill him,
expose him as a false god,

07:11.343 --> 07:13.476
and now I'm being
controlled by another god.

07:13.520 --> 07:15.086
- And that's the--

07:15.130 --> 07:16.305
Anti-Monitor?

07:16.348 --> 07:17.741
- He laid a perfect trail
for me to follow,

07:17.785 --> 07:20.701
but all along,
he was manipulating me

07:20.744 --> 07:23.704
so that he could gain
a foothold in this universe.

07:23.747 --> 07:24.835
- Why didn't you resist him?

07:24.879 --> 07:26.097
- His will was too strong

07:26.141 --> 07:28.926
and now I am forced
to bear witness

07:28.970 --> 07:31.668
as he destroys
world after world.

07:31.712 --> 07:32.756
- That's why
we're gonna stop him.

07:32.800 --> 07:35.629
Now can you open that door?

07:35.672 --> 07:37.718
- I cannot.

07:37.761 --> 07:39.110
My memories as Nash

07:39.154 --> 07:41.635
are somehow lost to me
as Pariah, but you can.

07:41.678 --> 07:43.506
- By vibing those memories?

07:43.550 --> 07:44.855
- Yes.

08:03.395 --> 08:04.701
- What did you see?

08:04.745 --> 08:06.486
- A way in.

08:06.529 --> 08:11.229
- You think the book can bring
back the destroyed Earths?

08:13.493 --> 08:14.929
Oh, too good.

08:14.972 --> 08:18.236
- We don't have time for this.

08:19.890 --> 08:22.676
- Tell us how to use the book
or lose an arm--your choice.

08:22.719 --> 08:24.634
- Do the strong-arm tactics
work in Gotham City?

08:26.418 --> 08:30.727
The book channels
ancient and endless power.

08:30.771 --> 08:33.861
It takes immense willpower
and focus to make it work.

08:33.904 --> 08:35.689
- What did you focus on?

08:35.732 --> 08:38.343
- His hatred for Superman.

08:38.387 --> 08:39.431
- Got it in one.

08:40.824 --> 08:42.260
But that was easy
for the book to provide.

08:42.304 --> 08:43.610
You try to use it on the scale
that you're talking about,

08:43.653 --> 08:46.264
and it could drive you mad.

08:46.308 --> 08:47.744
Like Deegan.

08:53.881 --> 08:55.447
- Kara, there's no telling

08:55.491 --> 08:57.014
what kind of ripple effect
this could have.

08:57.058 --> 08:59.582
- I'm supposed to be the
Paragon of Hope, right?

08:59.626 --> 09:01.279
Maybe this is my role,

09:01.323 --> 09:04.761
to bring back my Earth and--
and Argo and all the others.

09:04.805 --> 09:06.676
I have to find a way
to fix this.

09:10.593 --> 09:11.725
- See you soon.

09:17.165 --> 09:20.734
- So why did we take a detour
to another parallel Earth?

09:20.777 --> 09:22.387
- So many Earths
are already gone.

09:22.431 --> 09:23.780
The pillars of magic
are crumbling,

09:23.824 --> 09:24.999
leaving me the worse for wear,

09:25.042 --> 09:26.653
so I can't get us
into Purgatory.

09:26.696 --> 09:28.524
But don't worry, squire.

09:28.568 --> 09:30.744
Luckily, I know a guy.

09:30.787 --> 09:32.136
- Oh, you're gonna love her.

09:32.180 --> 09:34.617
She's pretty much
up for everything.

09:34.661 --> 09:37.489
- Always a pleasure
to see you, Lucy.

09:38.578 --> 09:40.405
- It's time.

09:40.449 --> 09:42.016
- Excuse me, ladies.

09:42.059 --> 09:43.670
Seems like you're not the only
ones who want a piece of me.

09:43.713 --> 09:45.454
I'll see you later.

09:45.497 --> 09:48.022
Johnny.

09:48.065 --> 09:49.501
I'd like to say it's a pleasure

09:49.545 --> 09:52.069
to see you on my Earth
outside my club.

09:52.113 --> 09:54.855
It's not.

09:54.898 --> 09:56.334
Hello.

09:56.378 --> 09:58.815
Don't believe we've met.
Lucifer Morningstar.

09:58.859 --> 10:01.078
- Lucifer Morningstar,
as in--

10:01.122 --> 10:02.863
- The devil.
Yes, exactly.

10:02.906 --> 10:07.476
So tell me.
What is it you desire?

10:07.519 --> 10:09.652
- I--

10:09.696 --> 10:12.786
I, uh--

10:12.829 --> 10:14.918
I desire to get my father back.

10:14.962 --> 10:17.399
Daddy issues.

10:17.442 --> 10:18.879
Why didn't you say so?

10:18.922 --> 10:20.184
- Look, I don't know

10:20.228 --> 10:21.882
if you have an Oliver Queen
on your world,

10:21.925 --> 10:25.233
but ours has, uh,
shuffled off this mortal coil.

10:25.276 --> 10:28.671
- A soul retrieval, blah, blah,
blah, the worlds are ending.

10:28.715 --> 10:31.587
It's all very Biblical, John.

10:31.631 --> 10:32.806
Okay, okay.

10:32.849 --> 10:35.852
I'm only doing this
'cause I owe you for Maz.

10:35.896 --> 10:37.419
- Yeah, you do.

10:37.462 --> 10:39.116
- You remind me
of my brother, by the way--

10:39.160 --> 10:41.553
tall, dark, annoyed by me.

10:41.597 --> 10:42.859
- You gonna help us or not?

10:42.903 --> 10:44.382
- Oh, flirt.

10:44.426 --> 10:46.689
The devil always sees through
on a deal.

10:46.733 --> 10:48.691
Take this card.

10:48.735 --> 10:50.911
You'll have a limited time
once inside Purgatory,

10:50.954 --> 10:52.739
and once the picture
completely fades--

10:52.782 --> 10:55.785
- Our souls will be decimated,
blah, blah, blah.

10:55.829 --> 10:57.439
- And trapped
in eternity forever,

10:57.482 --> 10:58.832
so I don't recommend it.

10:58.875 --> 11:01.225
Consider us even,
John Constan-tine.

11:01.269 --> 11:03.837
Constantine.

11:03.880 --> 11:06.143
-  Is it?
I don't care.

11:06.187 --> 11:09.103
Always a pleasure
doing business with mortals.

11:09.146 --> 11:10.191
Eh?

11:12.584 --> 11:14.543
- He forgot to tell us
what to do.

11:14.586 --> 11:15.805
- Did he, now?

11:25.946 --> 11:27.382
Ah.

11:27.425 --> 11:29.819
Welcome to Purgatory.

11:29.863 --> 11:31.168
- Looks a lot like Lian Yu.

11:31.212 --> 11:33.083
- Which is Mandarin
for "purgatory."

11:33.127 --> 11:35.695
- Lovely little
coincidence, eh?

11:35.738 --> 11:38.132
- Any idea why Dad's soul
would choose to come here?

11:38.175 --> 11:39.960
- Souls choose their prisons.

11:40.003 --> 11:41.483
This place must be
what Oliver thinks about

11:41.526 --> 11:43.746
when being trapped
for all eternity.

11:43.790 --> 11:45.008
It's a funny thing too,

11:45.052 --> 11:46.706
considering his memories
are probably missing.

11:46.749 --> 11:47.881
- What are you talking about?

11:47.924 --> 11:49.534
- The second that
Oliver's soul landed here,

11:49.578 --> 11:53.190
his memories would've been--
how can I put it?

11:53.234 --> 11:54.931
Squeegeed.

11:54.975 --> 11:57.455
- So we'll have
to make him remember us.

11:57.499 --> 11:58.500
- Bollocks.

11:58.543 --> 11:59.893
We'll have
to get a move on as well.

11:59.936 --> 12:01.982
This card is already
beginning to fade.

12:02.025 --> 12:03.244
Well, when you work
with the devil

12:03.287 --> 12:05.637
you never know
quite what you're getting.

12:05.681 --> 12:07.161
- No pressure there, right?

12:07.204 --> 12:09.554
Perimeter's clear.

12:09.598 --> 12:12.775
There's no sign of any
Quantum Tower on Earth-1.

12:12.819 --> 12:13.863
What are you doing here,
Pariah?

12:13.907 --> 12:16.910
- Behind this wall--
his domain.

12:16.953 --> 12:19.042
- What Mr. Green Jeans
is trying to say

12:19.086 --> 12:21.262
is once we get inside,
we can actually stop

12:21.305 --> 12:23.133
the anti-matter wave
right at the source.

12:23.177 --> 12:24.221
- All right, let's do it.

12:43.850 --> 12:45.199
- Whoa.

12:45.242 --> 12:47.810
This place has some
crazy vibrational frequency

12:47.854 --> 12:49.203
surging through it.

12:49.246 --> 12:50.813
- This place is the nexus

12:50.857 --> 12:54.164
between the anti-matter
universe and your own.

12:54.208 --> 12:57.733
Behold, Anti-Matter Cannon--
this is the source of the wave.

12:57.777 --> 13:00.736
- Guys, I think
this blur is alive.

13:01.998 --> 13:03.695
- Let me check it out.

13:03.739 --> 13:04.914
- No!

13:13.314 --> 13:15.359
- Barry!
- What happened?

13:15.403 --> 13:16.883
- It's a force field.
I couldn't get through.

13:16.926 --> 13:19.146
It's the Flash from Earth-90.

13:19.189 --> 13:21.061
He's trapped on that treadmill.

13:25.674 --> 13:28.155
- That's Barry Allen
from Earth-90?

13:28.198 --> 13:29.896
- How did he get there?

13:29.939 --> 13:31.332
- The Monitor sent him away.

13:31.375 --> 13:34.683
- You will not do to this
Earth what you did to mine.

13:36.119 --> 13:37.294
- He wound up
in the Netherverse

13:37.338 --> 13:38.905
where the Anti-Monitor
found him,

13:38.948 --> 13:40.341
corralled his speed,

13:40.384 --> 13:43.561
used it to build
his Anti-Matter Cannon,

13:43.605 --> 13:44.736
test-fired it...

13:49.045 --> 13:51.874
Destroying Earth-2.

13:51.918 --> 13:54.050
- Harry's gone?
- Jesse.

13:54.094 --> 13:55.965
- Pariah,
how do we stop the cannon?

13:56.009 --> 13:58.750
- The force field that contains
this is anti-matter based.

13:58.794 --> 14:00.187
As such,

14:00.230 --> 14:03.146
anything made of positive
matter cannot penetrate it.

14:03.190 --> 14:06.671
- We have to get the Flash
off that treadmill.

14:06.715 --> 14:10.023
The Monitor said
Vibe had to live--

14:10.066 --> 14:11.198
that he had a purpose.

14:11.241 --> 14:12.895
Maybe this is it.

14:18.596 --> 14:19.902
- Here goes nothing.

14:30.043 --> 14:32.959
- Thank you for the reprieve.

14:34.221 --> 14:36.136
But you gotta
put me back on it.

14:37.964 --> 14:40.053
- Guys.

14:40.096 --> 14:43.534
- The Anti-Monitor designed
that treadmill with a failsafe

14:43.578 --> 14:45.841
so that if I ever got off
of it, it would erupt,

14:45.885 --> 14:49.018
destroying all remaining
Earths at once.

14:49.062 --> 14:51.151
We only have a few minutes.

14:51.194 --> 14:52.630
- Pariah, how do--

14:52.674 --> 14:53.980
Pariah?

14:54.023 --> 14:56.025
Where'd he go?
Where'd he go?

14:59.072 --> 15:00.638
- Amanda, please.

15:00.682 --> 15:03.293
I know the red skies
are freaky, honey,

15:03.337 --> 15:06.862
but I'm sure
it's just atmospheric...

15:08.168 --> 15:09.952
Dr. Ryan Choi?

15:09.996 --> 15:11.562
- Disturbance.

15:11.606 --> 15:13.216
Babe, I gotta go.

15:13.260 --> 15:17.003
Wow, is that really you?

15:17.046 --> 15:19.005
Dr. Ray Palmer?

15:19.048 --> 15:20.571
Oh. Emm. Gosh.

15:20.615 --> 15:23.226
I'm Ryan Choi.
It's so wonderful to meet you.

15:23.270 --> 15:25.359
Your second paper on
subatomic density manipulation

15:25.402 --> 15:28.188
was the foundation for my work
on miniaturization.

15:28.231 --> 15:29.145
- Wow, thank you.
You know, I--

15:29.189 --> 15:30.625
- Okay, Dr. Choi,

15:30.668 --> 15:32.148
we need you to come
with us right now.

15:32.192 --> 15:34.063
- Look, you've seen
the red skies outside?

15:34.107 --> 15:36.631
The world is ending.

15:36.674 --> 15:39.547
- Dr. Palmer,
who are these people?

15:39.590 --> 15:41.636
We are superheroes,

15:41.679 --> 15:43.986
and Ryan,
we need your help.

15:45.205 --> 15:46.946
Sure, Dr. Palmer.
Good one.

15:46.989 --> 15:48.469
And next you're gonna tell me
I've been nominated

15:48.512 --> 15:50.166
for the Breakthrough Prize
in Fundamental Physics?

15:50.210 --> 15:51.428
- Okay, we don't have time
for this.

15:51.472 --> 15:53.909
- Seeing is believing, right?

15:57.608 --> 15:58.348
Tissue?

15:58.392 --> 16:01.961
- You're Elongated Man?

16:04.615 --> 16:06.008
Are--are you superheroes, too?

16:06.052 --> 16:07.053
- I know
this sounds cuckoo, pal,

16:07.096 --> 16:09.316
but you're what's called
a Paragon,

16:09.359 --> 16:11.100
which is a fancy word
for saying,

16:11.144 --> 16:14.756
"We need your help
to save the universe."

16:14.799 --> 16:17.237
- Dr. Choi.

16:17.280 --> 16:19.021
- If the world's ending,

16:19.065 --> 16:22.938
I need to go home.

16:22.982 --> 16:25.114
- Please, Ryan.
We really need your help.

16:25.158 --> 16:28.030
- No, you don't.
I'm no hero.

16:28.074 --> 16:29.640
I'm a husband.

16:29.684 --> 16:32.861
And if this is the end, I have
to be with my wife and kid.

16:32.904 --> 16:34.471
I'm sorry.

16:47.310 --> 16:49.921
- Another Earth is gone.

16:49.965 --> 16:52.881
- There's only seven left
in the multiverse.

16:52.924 --> 16:54.926
It's ironic.

16:54.970 --> 16:57.103
I'm watching
the biggest event in history,

16:57.146 --> 16:59.627
the destruction of every Earth,

16:59.670 --> 17:02.934
and no one will ever
read the story.

17:02.978 --> 17:06.068
- These Earths are not
the only worlds destroyed.

17:06.112 --> 17:09.071
My world died.

17:09.115 --> 17:10.203
My family.

17:12.379 --> 17:14.511
- What were they like?

17:14.555 --> 17:15.773
- Mm.

17:18.124 --> 17:20.648
So full of life.

17:22.998 --> 17:26.697
They were everything to me.

17:26.741 --> 17:30.701
If only I'd cared
as much for them

17:30.745 --> 17:33.791
as I did my work.

17:39.145 --> 17:40.233
I now understand why

17:40.276 --> 17:43.192
you are such a good reporter,
Miss Lane.

17:47.153 --> 17:48.284
- Clark?

17:49.372 --> 17:51.374
I couldn't save them.

17:51.418 --> 17:52.723
- You wanna take a minute?

17:52.767 --> 17:55.248
Looks like you could
use a breather.

17:55.291 --> 17:57.859
- Put this on,

17:57.902 --> 17:59.991
this crest--

18:00.035 --> 18:02.168
I made a promise

18:02.211 --> 18:06.085
to keep fighting
no matter what.

18:06.128 --> 18:08.130
- Hey, why'd you
add black to it?

18:10.176 --> 18:12.047
- Because, Lois,

18:12.091 --> 18:16.660
even in the darkest times,
hope cuts through.

18:16.704 --> 18:21.143
Hope is the light that lifts us
out of darkness.

18:21.187 --> 18:24.364
I must go back.

18:25.974 --> 18:28.759
- Guy never quits no matter
what Earth he's from, huh?

18:32.023 --> 18:34.200
Now you're just talking
to yourself.

18:37.072 --> 18:38.160
- It's getting worse.

18:38.204 --> 18:39.335
- Put me back
on that treadmill.

18:39.379 --> 18:41.163
- No, all right?
We'll find another way.

18:48.953 --> 18:50.564
- Where am I?
- Who are you?

18:50.607 --> 18:53.044
- Send me back to Freeland now!

18:53.088 --> 18:55.569
- Calm down, Electric Guy.

18:55.612 --> 18:57.527
- The name is Black Lightning.

19:04.752 --> 19:06.188
- Enough!

19:06.232 --> 19:09.409
I did not bring you here,
Jefferson, to fight.

19:09.452 --> 19:11.237
I brought you here
to save lives.

19:11.280 --> 19:13.804
- Who the hell are you people?
- I am Pariah.

19:13.848 --> 19:16.024
This is Jefferson Pierce.
On his Earth--

19:16.067 --> 19:19.593
an educator,
a father, and a hero.

19:19.636 --> 19:21.377
- What do you mean, my Earth?

19:21.421 --> 19:22.509
- There are multiple Earths,
Jefferson--

19:22.552 --> 19:24.163
many Earths like this one.

19:24.206 --> 19:25.338
Your Earth...

19:28.645 --> 19:31.344
Has just been destroyed
by a wave of anti-matter.

19:31.387 --> 19:32.867
- So--so--

19:32.910 --> 19:34.738
Lynn, my girls?

19:34.782 --> 19:37.306
- They're gone.

19:37.350 --> 19:41.136
I transported you here
to help us save humanity.

19:42.355 --> 19:44.226
You should've saved
my family, not me!

19:44.270 --> 19:45.227
Not me!

19:45.271 --> 19:47.142
- Jefferson.

19:47.186 --> 19:48.796
I'm so sorry.

19:48.839 --> 19:52.278
Right now we need your help
to stop this anti-matter wave.

19:52.321 --> 19:54.367
I can't imagine
how you're feeling,

19:54.410 --> 19:56.325
but I do know how it feels
to lose your family.

19:58.414 --> 20:00.677
What would they want you
to do right now?

20:00.721 --> 20:02.331
- Please.

20:02.375 --> 20:04.333
All worlds could die.

20:10.687 --> 20:12.167
- What do you need from me?

20:12.211 --> 20:13.429
- That machine behind you

20:13.473 --> 20:14.474
is the source
of the anti-matter wave.

20:14.517 --> 20:16.040
- We have to disable it,

20:16.084 --> 20:17.346
but we can't get near it.

20:17.390 --> 20:19.087
Can you contain
that much energy?

20:24.527 --> 20:26.486
- Let's find out.

20:40.717 --> 20:42.197
- Don't.

20:42.241 --> 20:44.373
You open that book, and you
do not know what will happen.

20:44.417 --> 20:45.548
Do you?

20:45.592 --> 20:47.289
To all of the Earths
you're trying to save?

20:47.333 --> 20:48.290
- I have to, Kate.

20:48.334 --> 20:49.813
Those people?
They need help.

20:49.857 --> 20:52.076
- And we are doing our best
to help who we can.

20:52.120 --> 20:53.339
That is not the answer.

20:53.382 --> 20:54.949
- Then what am I
supposed to do?

20:54.992 --> 20:57.299
Just be okay with
all those people dying?

20:57.343 --> 20:58.996
Like Bruce?

20:59.040 --> 21:01.347
Believe that if life's
supposed to end, just let it?

21:01.390 --> 21:02.609
- No, of course not,

21:02.652 --> 21:05.438
but if you open that book,
it will destroy you.

21:05.481 --> 21:06.787
- I have to do this.

21:06.830 --> 21:09.268
Then I have to stop you.

21:10.399 --> 21:12.140
- You won't be able to.

21:15.317 --> 21:16.971
- You'd be surprised.

21:19.843 --> 21:23.412
I wish things
were different, Kara.

21:23.456 --> 21:26.023
I wish I was hopeful like you.

21:26.067 --> 21:30.767
But one thing I do know is if
you take a chance on that book

21:30.811 --> 21:35.555
and it doesn't work
and something happens to you,

21:35.598 --> 21:37.426
we're all doomed.

21:50.918 --> 21:52.702
Tick, tock, people.

21:52.746 --> 21:54.356
- Black Lightning
is gonna kill himself

21:54.400 --> 21:55.488
if we don't solve this soon.

21:55.531 --> 21:57.228
- Then we need more time.

21:59.318 --> 22:02.712
Every second that we waste here
another Earth dies.

22:02.756 --> 22:04.366
That wave gets closer
to my wife.

22:04.410 --> 22:06.716
- I was married once, too.

22:06.760 --> 22:08.414
Tina always said
that keeping me running

22:08.457 --> 22:10.720
was her purpose in life,

22:10.764 --> 22:13.462
so as someone who's
been running for 30 years,

22:13.506 --> 22:14.550
let me tell you.

22:14.594 --> 22:15.725
Sometimes,

22:15.769 --> 22:18.554
in order to find
your purpose as a hero,

22:18.598 --> 22:20.469
you gotta take
a couple steps back.

22:20.513 --> 22:23.429
Reverse the way
you see the situation

22:23.472 --> 22:26.997
and see a bigger picture.

22:27.041 --> 22:28.259
- That's it.

22:29.652 --> 22:31.480
I know how to stop the cannon.

22:31.524 --> 22:33.439
This is what The Monitor meant
that day in the Time Vault.

22:33.482 --> 22:36.877
This is what I've been running
towards all these years.

22:36.920 --> 22:40.620
It's time for Flash
to vanish in Crisis.

22:46.365 --> 22:48.454
- Reversing the treadmill's
directional velocity

22:48.497 --> 22:50.760
could make the
anti-matter wave recede

22:50.804 --> 22:52.458
and funnel back into
the speed cannon...

22:52.501 --> 22:54.416
- Destroying the machine
and the wave...

22:54.460 --> 22:56.070
- Ending this once
and for all...

22:56.113 --> 22:57.898
- Freeing me from
the Anti-Monitor's control.

22:59.987 --> 23:03.556
Where's the future?
Right here.

23:03.599 --> 23:06.472
Whose life is this?
Mine.

23:06.515 --> 23:08.474
What are you gonna do with it?

23:08.517 --> 23:12.086
Live it
by any means necessary.

23:13.479 --> 23:15.611
- It's gonna be okay.
We're gonna find him.

23:15.655 --> 23:16.960
- You don't know that.

23:17.004 --> 23:18.701
Dad's soul
could be lost forever.

23:18.745 --> 23:20.573
- Family's everything to Oliver.
He'll come back to us.

23:27.710 --> 23:30.365
- Whoa, Oliver, Oliver!
Oliver, wait, man.

23:30.409 --> 23:31.584
Listen to me.
I see you, man,

23:31.627 --> 23:33.237
and I'm so sorry
that I wasn't there

23:33.281 --> 23:35.501
to have your back during
Crisis, but I'm here now.

23:35.544 --> 23:37.241
I need you to come back to us.

23:37.285 --> 23:39.679
You're my brother.

23:39.722 --> 23:41.463
I can't lose you, man.

23:43.639 --> 23:45.467
I can't lose you.

23:54.520 --> 23:55.651
- Hey, John.

24:01.788 --> 24:04.225
- Mia, you came.
- Of course I did.

24:14.322 --> 24:16.498
- They're beautiful.

24:16.542 --> 24:19.588
I didn't get to introduce
myself earlier, Dr. Choi.

24:19.632 --> 24:21.721
I'm Iris West-Allen
from Central City.

24:21.764 --> 24:23.853
- Are you a superhero, too?

24:23.897 --> 24:26.073
- No, I'm just like you.

24:26.116 --> 24:28.205
Look, I know this
is a lot to ask

24:28.249 --> 24:30.860
and you're right to want
to be with your family

24:30.904 --> 24:33.254
when things go bad.

24:35.125 --> 24:36.692
What about you?

24:36.736 --> 24:39.434
You clearly have someone
in your life you care about.

24:39.478 --> 24:41.958
Don't you want to die holding
them when the world ends?

24:42.002 --> 24:43.525
- My husband's not like us.

24:43.569 --> 24:46.223
He goes out there
as a superhero day after day

24:46.267 --> 24:49.009
and faces whatever he has to
to keep his city safe.

24:49.052 --> 24:51.620
- That's really brave, Iris,

24:51.664 --> 24:52.882
but that's not me.

24:52.926 --> 24:55.450
See, I'm nothing
like your husband.

24:55.494 --> 24:56.582
- No, no, you're not.

24:58.453 --> 25:01.282
You're human,
and we have a purpose too.

25:01.325 --> 25:05.416
We remind superheroes
what they're fighting for.

25:05.460 --> 25:08.811
- My wife, Amanda and I,

25:08.855 --> 25:12.685
just had a baby six months ago.

25:12.728 --> 25:15.209
Simone.

25:15.252 --> 25:17.864
I might not get
to see her grow up.

25:17.907 --> 25:19.648
- Don't you want to hold her
knowing that

25:19.692 --> 25:22.738
you had a hand
in making the world safer?

25:36.578 --> 25:40.626
I need to go tell my wife
I'm gonna be late for dinner.

25:42.628 --> 25:43.585
- Just got word from Lois.

25:43.629 --> 25:45.718
Six more Earths are gone.

25:45.761 --> 25:48.198
This is the only Earth left.

25:48.242 --> 25:50.679
- At least now we have Ryan.
- Yeah.

25:50.723 --> 25:52.463
- How'd you know
what to say to him?

25:54.509 --> 25:56.380
- Iris.

25:56.424 --> 25:59.645
- Hey, what is it?

25:59.688 --> 26:03.039
- What if this is it?

26:03.083 --> 26:04.432
What if

26:04.475 --> 26:07.522
stopping the wave
is my purpose as a Paragon?

26:07.566 --> 26:10.569
I mean, what if it's
the sacrifice I have to make?

26:10.612 --> 26:11.874
- Well, if this is it,

26:11.918 --> 26:13.354
then I don't want you
to die without me, Barry.

26:13.397 --> 26:14.703
I don't want you to be alone.
I'll come with you.

26:14.747 --> 26:17.880
- No.
You can't come, Iris.

26:17.924 --> 26:19.490
I may be the one
with superpowers,

26:19.534 --> 26:22.842
but your intelligence,
your resourcefulness,

26:22.885 --> 26:24.757
your heart--

26:24.800 --> 26:26.889
that's your superpower and
that's what's gonna help you

26:26.933 --> 26:30.371
convince Ryan Choi
to be the hero he needs to be.

26:30.414 --> 26:32.416
- Barry, I don't want
to live this life without you.

26:32.460 --> 26:36.029
I don't--
I don't want to say goodbye.

26:36.072 --> 26:38.771
- When I put this ring
on your finger,

26:38.814 --> 26:41.904
I promised I'd always
come running home to you.

26:43.427 --> 26:47.780
And if we're apart,
for however long,

26:47.823 --> 26:49.999
know that wherever I go,

26:50.043 --> 26:52.872
I will be running home to you.

27:01.968 --> 27:04.144
- Are you still sure
you want me to go?

27:04.187 --> 27:05.667
- Yeah.

27:05.711 --> 27:07.974
Go find Ryan Choi

27:08.017 --> 27:10.846
and hurry back.

27:10.890 --> 27:12.674
- I'll see you soon.

27:30.300 --> 27:32.041
- Caitlin.

27:32.085 --> 27:34.870
- I don't wanna say goodbye.

27:34.914 --> 27:35.828
- You two were there
the first time

27:35.871 --> 27:38.700
I opened my eyes
as the Flash.

27:38.744 --> 27:41.703
I couldn't be the hero I am
without you guys.

27:52.758 --> 27:54.368
Tell Joe and Iris I love them.

27:54.411 --> 27:56.849
- We will.

27:56.892 --> 27:58.633
- Sorry, kid,

27:58.677 --> 27:59.939
but this has to happen.

28:01.854 --> 28:02.898
- Barry, what are you doing?

28:02.942 --> 28:05.771
- I'm momentarily
stealing your speed.

28:05.814 --> 28:07.860
You play the speedster game
long enough,

28:07.903 --> 28:09.949
you learn some neat tricks.

28:09.992 --> 28:11.124
- Wait, why are you doing this?

28:11.167 --> 28:12.995
- Novu said the Flash
must die in Crisis.

28:13.039 --> 28:14.823
He never said which one.

28:29.838 --> 28:31.753
- You're a true hero,
Jefferson.

28:31.797 --> 28:33.755
I can't thank you enough.

28:34.930 --> 28:36.976
Open the breach.

28:37.019 --> 28:38.238
I need to get
in that force field.

28:38.281 --> 28:39.369
- No.

28:39.413 --> 28:41.154
- Do you want
your friend to die?

28:41.197 --> 28:43.939
Let me do this.
Let me save you all.

28:43.983 --> 28:45.375
- Cisco, don't.

28:46.986 --> 28:49.902
Cisco, come on.

28:53.819 --> 28:57.344
- Thank you.
Keep riding the lightning, son.

28:57.387 --> 29:01.087
I know you'll make us
all proud.

29:05.700 --> 29:07.833
Barry!

29:07.876 --> 29:09.095
He's gonna die, Cisco!

29:09.138 --> 29:10.792
- You made me team leader,
and sometimes,

29:10.836 --> 29:12.925
the leader has to make
the tough choices.

29:16.624 --> 29:18.147
- We can't stay here.

29:18.191 --> 29:20.367
- Let's go.
- No.

29:20.410 --> 29:21.847
- Let's go.
- No, I'm not done--

29:21.890 --> 29:22.978
- Barry, let's go!

29:23.022 --> 29:24.501
- I'm not going!
- Come on!

29:42.128 --> 29:45.000
I have faith in you, Tina.

29:45.044 --> 29:47.873
- Well, the truth is,
I have faith in you, too.

30:21.907 --> 30:23.517
- I hate to break up
the reunion,

30:23.560 --> 30:24.953
but this really is our cue
to make like a tree

30:24.997 --> 30:26.520
and get Oliver's soul back
to his body.

30:26.563 --> 30:29.001
- Oliver Queen.

30:29.044 --> 30:30.698
- Who are you?

30:30.741 --> 30:33.309
- Jim Corrigan.
- Another one I know.

30:33.353 --> 30:34.920
- But I'm also someone else.

30:34.963 --> 30:37.574
I'm something else--

30:37.618 --> 30:38.793
a spectre.

30:41.013 --> 30:42.623
- Take a hike, crazy eyes.

30:42.666 --> 30:44.843
- In another life, I was
a decorated police officer,

30:44.886 --> 30:46.322
a hero in my own right,

30:46.366 --> 30:48.847
but then I was called
to a higher purpose.

30:48.890 --> 30:50.849
It's your turn now, Oliver.

30:53.025 --> 30:55.462
Only you can light
the spark, Oliver.

30:55.505 --> 30:58.291
It is your destiny.
- What is my destiny?

30:58.334 --> 31:00.032
- To save everyone.

31:00.075 --> 31:01.903
Otherwise, all universes--

31:01.947 --> 31:04.906
all the people you love
will perish.

31:16.135 --> 31:19.094
- I'm sorry, but I have to.
- Dad, no.

31:19.138 --> 31:20.095
- It's gonna be okay.

31:23.098 --> 31:24.752
It's going to be okay.

31:34.196 --> 31:37.243
What now?
- Dad, wait.

31:37.286 --> 31:39.985
I love--

31:50.909 --> 31:53.433
- What happened?

31:53.476 --> 31:55.609
- Dad wouldn't
come back with us.

31:55.652 --> 31:57.480
- I'm sorry, Sara.

31:57.524 --> 31:59.482
- The others fare any better?

31:59.526 --> 32:01.180
- Barry's team stopped
the anti-matter wave

32:01.223 --> 32:03.791
with one Earth left.

32:03.834 --> 32:05.401
- I need a drink.

32:06.663 --> 32:09.014
- I appreciate you
helping us, Jefferson.

32:09.057 --> 32:11.451
I know what you've lost.

32:14.149 --> 32:18.066
- My world...

32:18.110 --> 32:21.156
I lost the love of my life,

32:21.200 --> 32:23.202
my two daughters.

32:28.337 --> 32:32.167
Nothing will ever
be okay again.

32:32.211 --> 32:33.386
- I know.

32:33.429 --> 32:37.477
That Flash,
the Flash from Earth-90--

32:37.520 --> 32:39.435
he looked just like my dad,

32:39.479 --> 32:42.003
Henry Allen.

32:42.047 --> 32:44.788
He was a resilient man.

32:44.832 --> 32:49.489
He spent years in prison
for the murder of my mom,

32:49.532 --> 32:53.710
a crime one of my enemies
committed and framed him for.

32:53.754 --> 32:56.409
Through all that,
he never lost his light.

32:58.585 --> 33:01.762
Times like this,

33:01.805 --> 33:03.633
I try and do the same.

33:03.677 --> 33:05.766
- My father, uh,

33:05.809 --> 33:08.073
Alvin Pierce--

33:08.116 --> 33:10.075
he was a good man, too.

33:10.118 --> 33:13.165
Reporter.

33:13.208 --> 33:16.603
Spent his life giving
a voice to the voiceless.

33:20.085 --> 33:22.609
He was murdered when I was 12.

33:25.351 --> 33:29.137
But I still carry the lessons
he taught me to this day.

33:29.181 --> 33:30.921
I passed them along
to my girls.

33:34.055 --> 33:36.884
My girls.

33:43.934 --> 33:46.850
Anyway, I get it.

33:48.809 --> 33:50.071
Look.

33:50.115 --> 33:54.336
I don't think Henry or Alvin
raised any quitters,

33:54.380 --> 33:59.080
so we should
honor their memory...

33:59.124 --> 34:01.561
and rage...

34:01.604 --> 34:05.086
against the dying of the light.

34:05.130 --> 34:07.088
- Dylan Thomas.

34:07.132 --> 34:11.266
- Well, all right then, Flash.

34:11.310 --> 34:13.138
- It's Barry.

34:13.181 --> 34:15.314
Barry Allen.

34:18.839 --> 34:21.102
- Jefferson Pierce.

34:26.803 --> 34:28.327
- Hey, Kara.

34:28.370 --> 34:32.157
Listen, I--I get you wanted
to bring those people back.

34:32.200 --> 34:36.857
You have the biggest heart
of anyone that I've ever met.

34:36.900 --> 34:39.164
I just don't want
to see you get hurt.

34:39.207 --> 34:40.252
You know, I gotta say.

34:40.295 --> 34:41.601
For someone who was unsure

34:41.644 --> 34:44.560
that they were
the Paragon of Courage,

34:44.604 --> 34:47.085
took a lot of guts
to do what you did.

34:47.128 --> 34:48.695
- Maybe.

34:48.738 --> 34:50.349
But I have hope that
there's a better way.

34:52.394 --> 34:54.266
Which is why--

34:54.309 --> 34:55.832
which is why I wanted
to give you this.

34:57.921 --> 34:59.662
- Kryptonite.

34:59.706 --> 35:02.274
Why do you have that?
- It was Bruce Wayne's.

35:02.317 --> 35:05.929
He lost hope and I never will.

35:08.410 --> 35:10.151
- Keep it.

35:10.195 --> 35:12.849
I have the courage that
you'll never have to use it.

35:16.244 --> 35:18.072
- Attention.

35:18.116 --> 35:21.293
Iris, Ralph, and Raymond
have returned with Dr. Choi.

35:23.033 --> 35:24.339
- Iris.

35:24.383 --> 35:26.341
I told you I'd come
running home to you.

35:31.216 --> 35:32.434
- It wasn't you, then?

35:32.478 --> 35:34.523
- It was the Barry Allen
from Earth-90.

35:40.616 --> 35:42.705
Everyone,
this is Jefferson Pierce.

35:42.749 --> 35:44.359
We wouldn't have been able
to stop the anti-matter wave

35:44.403 --> 35:45.665
without him.

35:45.708 --> 35:47.275
- Wait, so--
so the Superman thing is real?

35:47.319 --> 35:49.408
Oh, damn.
After all these years.

35:49.451 --> 35:52.193
- And this is your Paragon
of Humanity, Ryan Choi--

35:52.237 --> 35:53.542
scientist, super brain,

35:53.586 --> 35:55.718
and ready to help
save the universe.

35:55.762 --> 35:58.199
- How do you guys plan
on doing that, exactly?

35:58.243 --> 36:00.245
- Well, Kara decided not
to use the Book of Destiny.

36:00.288 --> 36:02.072
- It was too risky.

36:02.116 --> 36:04.553
- And Harbinger, unlike me,
can travel anywhere she wants.

36:04.597 --> 36:06.076
So how do we find her?

36:06.120 --> 36:07.426
- By whatever means necessary.

36:09.254 --> 36:10.646
- Well, we can start by trying

36:10.690 --> 36:13.040
to re-task the Waverider's
satellite search grid.

36:19.829 --> 36:21.266
- Lyla.

36:21.309 --> 36:22.571
- Johnny.

36:22.615 --> 36:25.357
- You okay?
- I'm sorry.

36:25.400 --> 36:27.489
I tried to get word to you that
I was doing recon on Earth-1,

36:27.533 --> 36:29.448
but the deaths
of the other Earths

36:29.491 --> 36:30.579
is affecting my abilities.

36:30.623 --> 36:32.233
- Where were you on Earth-1?

36:32.277 --> 36:34.583
- I--

36:34.627 --> 36:36.455
I can't remember.
- It's okay.

36:36.498 --> 36:39.327
I thought I lost you, Lyla.
- Not that easy.

36:39.371 --> 36:40.937
I just...

36:40.981 --> 36:43.070
wish I could remember
what happened.

36:45.464 --> 36:47.292
- We'll figure this out.

36:47.335 --> 36:48.684
What if the Anti-Monitor

36:48.728 --> 36:50.164
wanted Harbinger
back on the ship?

36:50.208 --> 36:51.252
He's been controlling her

36:51.296 --> 36:52.471
the entire Crisis.

36:52.514 --> 36:54.299
- And controlling you,

36:54.342 --> 36:56.388
only allowing you to appear
when he wants you to see...

36:56.431 --> 36:59.521
- A great tragedy.

36:59.565 --> 37:01.610
Lyla?
- Lyla.

37:04.091 --> 37:05.310
- No!

37:08.400 --> 37:10.445
It is time

37:10.489 --> 37:13.318
to end the age of heroes

37:13.361 --> 37:16.277
and everything you hold close.

37:29.159 --> 37:30.291
- Lyla.

37:30.335 --> 37:32.467
- That is no longer your wife,
John Diggle.

37:32.511 --> 37:34.077
She has been taken by...

37:34.121 --> 37:36.210
- The Anti-Monitor.
- Murderer!

37:39.431 --> 37:42.216
- This is for my girls.

37:49.223 --> 37:51.617
- Lyla!
You have to fight him, Lyla!

37:51.660 --> 37:54.837
- The fate of all humanity
lies with you now, Pariah.

37:54.881 --> 37:55.969
- What can I do?

37:56.012 --> 37:58.450
- You will know
when the moment arrives.

38:20.428 --> 38:21.516
Pathetic.

38:21.560 --> 38:24.563
It was foolish
to try to stop me, Novu.

38:24.606 --> 38:27.392
- No, Mobius.

38:27.435 --> 38:31.221
It was foolish to allow your
creation in the first place.

38:31.265 --> 38:32.571
- Goodbye.

39:03.471 --> 39:07.475
- Alert.
Earth-1 is gone.

39:07.519 --> 39:09.390
- We're all that's left?

39:09.434 --> 39:13.394
- It is done.
The infinite Earths are gone.

39:13.438 --> 39:17.050
Soon only the anti-matter
universe will remain.

39:17.093 --> 39:18.921
- Warning.

39:18.965 --> 39:21.663
The anti-matter wave will hit
the ship in 28 seconds.

39:21.707 --> 39:23.578
- I know what I must do.

39:32.544 --> 39:34.459
- What's happening?

39:35.634 --> 39:37.113
- Iris.

39:39.420 --> 39:41.727
- Everyone to the bridge.
Now.

39:47.341 --> 39:48.603
- Where did you send them?

39:48.647 --> 39:50.213
- Somewhere
you can't touch 'em.

39:50.257 --> 39:52.390
- Wherever they are,
they're gonna fight you.

39:52.433 --> 39:53.869
- By any means necessary.

39:53.913 --> 39:55.523
- To their very last breath.

40:13.889 --> 40:15.978
- What the hell just happened?

40:16.022 --> 40:17.545
- Where are we?

40:19.460 --> 40:22.463
- This is the Vanishing Point.

40:22.507 --> 40:23.682
- What does that mean?

40:23.725 --> 40:26.598
- It's a point outside
of time and space.

40:26.641 --> 40:28.774
- What happened to the
Waverider and the others?

40:28.817 --> 40:31.559
- The Anti-Monitor--
he used Harbinger to attack us.

40:31.603 --> 40:33.735
Pariah must have
sent us here knowing

40:33.779 --> 40:35.694
that the Anti-Monitor
couldn't follow.

40:35.737 --> 40:38.000
- Well, we have to go back.
We have to go back right now!

40:38.044 --> 40:40.655
- Barry, we can't.
They're gone.

40:47.009 --> 40:48.924
-  Something's wrong.
- How?

40:48.968 --> 40:50.143
How?

40:50.186 --> 40:52.624
- Something's wrong.

40:52.667 --> 40:53.668
- Hey, hey, hey!

40:53.712 --> 40:55.931
- I can't--
- Come on.

40:55.975 --> 40:57.324
Please.

40:57.367 --> 40:59.718
Fix it.
Fix it.

40:59.761 --> 41:01.589
What do I do?

41:02.764 --> 41:04.505
- No, no!

41:18.867 --> 41:21.522
- Oh, I am so happy
that worked.

41:21.566 --> 41:23.655
- Lex, what did you do?

41:23.698 --> 41:26.527
- Well, I held
the Book of Destiny

41:26.571 --> 41:29.487
and I saw you seven Paragons

41:29.530 --> 41:31.619
due to be stranded
at the Vanishing Point,

41:31.663 --> 41:35.754
and I thought destiny
could use

41:35.797 --> 41:37.277
a little rewrite.

41:43.544 --> 41:46.765
So...

41:46.808 --> 41:48.593
what do we do now?

42:15.794 --> 42:17.056
- Greg, move your head.
