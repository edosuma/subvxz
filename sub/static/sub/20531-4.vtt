00:01.870 --> 00:04.750
GIORGIO A. TSOUKALOS:
This wall exists here,

00:04.750 --> 00:08.670
at one of the most
inaccessible places.

00:08.670 --> 00:13.680
These types of walls,
they exist all over the world.

00:13.680 --> 00:18.640
The building style is not
similar, it is identical.

00:18.640 --> 00:21.390
NARRATOR: Were alien structures
built on Earth

00:21.390 --> 00:24.270
as part of a master plan?

00:24.270 --> 00:26.980
FREDDY SILVA: That these temples
actually act as batteries.

00:26.980 --> 00:30.320
They store energy and they also
allow the energy to expand

00:30.320 --> 00:32.320
at certain times during the day.

00:32.320 --> 00:36.410
NARRATOR: Could they reveal
an extraterrestrial connection?

00:36.410 --> 00:38.910
RICHARD CASSARO: Ancient
cultures around the world

00:38.910 --> 00:41.700
connected their temples
to each other

00:41.700 --> 00:43.790
almost like
a master circuit board.

00:43.790 --> 00:47.380
NARRATOR: And did they serve
a larger purpose,

00:47.380 --> 00:50.250
one that reaches beyond Earth?

00:50.250 --> 00:53.470
DAVID CHILDRESS: They're somehow
looking at the Earth from space

00:53.470 --> 00:58.140
and seeing how these structures
would fit around the globe.

00:58.140 --> 01:02.430
Who could be doing this,
except for extraterrestrials?

01:02.430 --> 01:04.390
♪ ♪

01:34.340 --> 01:38.720
NARRATOR:
Siem Reap, Northwest Cambodia.

01:38.720 --> 01:43.100
Just outside the magnificent
ruins of Angkor Wat

01:43.100 --> 01:49.060
stands an ancient pyramid temple
known as Baksei Chamkrong.

01:49.060 --> 01:51.610
While it is
a solid rock structure,

01:51.610 --> 01:54.190
and therefore
cannot be carbon dated,

01:54.190 --> 01:56.950
mainstream archaeologists
suggest

01:56.950 --> 02:00.820
that it was constructed
in the tenth century AD.

02:03.120 --> 02:08.710
9,000 miles away,
in the Petén Basin of Guatemala,

02:08.710 --> 02:11.500
lay the ruins
of the Mayan city of Tikal.

02:11.500 --> 02:14.630
Amongst the long‐abandoned
structures

02:14.630 --> 02:17.510
is a Temple of the Great Jaguar,

02:17.510 --> 02:22.550
which is believed to date
back to the eighth century AD.

02:22.550 --> 02:25.770
When you see pictures
of these two pyramids

02:25.770 --> 02:30.230
on two different continents,
they're virtually identical.

02:30.230 --> 02:36.150
It's as if the same architect
had designed both of these.

02:36.150 --> 02:38.820
NARRATOR:
Although the Cambodian pyramid

02:38.820 --> 02:41.910
is much smaller
than the pyramid in Guatemala,

02:41.910 --> 02:45.700
the similarities between
the specific design features

02:45.700 --> 02:48.120
are uncanny.

02:48.120 --> 02:49.960
Both have
an unusually steep slope angle

02:49.960 --> 02:51.540
that we don't see
in other pyramids,

02:51.540 --> 02:55.590
they both have
a stepped formation.

02:55.590 --> 02:57.380
There's a stairwell
going up the middle,

02:57.380 --> 02:59.220
there's a domed area on the top,

02:59.220 --> 03:01.390
there's a little door
that goes in

03:01.390 --> 03:06.100
and there's interior structure
that looks the same, as well.

03:06.100 --> 03:07.930
You have the civilization
in Cambodia

03:07.930 --> 03:10.310
and the civilization
in Mesoamerica.

03:10.310 --> 03:13.110
There are so many parallels,
it's incredible.

03:13.110 --> 03:15.690
It's unbelievable that scholars
haven't, until now,

03:15.690 --> 03:17.690
recognized those parallels.

03:17.690 --> 03:21.530
Is it possible that they were
working off the same blueprint?

03:21.530 --> 03:26.450
And if so, where did
that blueprint come from?

03:26.450 --> 03:30.210
NARRATOR: Could it be that
these seemingly unrelated sites,

03:30.210 --> 03:32.920
located thousands
of miles apart,

03:32.920 --> 03:36.380
share a common architect?

03:36.380 --> 03:40.510
Cambodian lore attributes
the building of Angkor

03:40.510 --> 03:42.470
to Preah Pisnokar,

03:42.470 --> 03:47.760
a being of half‐human,
half‐divine origin.

03:47.760 --> 03:52.480
Preah Pisnokar is the son of
the moon goddess and a mortal.

03:52.480 --> 03:56.360
One day, she takes him
up to Heaven,

03:56.360 --> 03:58.860
where he meets
the great high god Indra,

03:58.860 --> 04:02.900
who decides that the boy is
to be given special schooling.

04:02.900 --> 04:07.280
At Indra's Heaven,
he was given instructions.

04:07.280 --> 04:11.160
Instructions about mathematics,
engineering, architecture,

04:11.160 --> 04:14.000
all these different
scientific disciplines.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.580
WILLIAM HENRY:
One very provocative way

04:15.580 --> 04:17.590
of looking at this story

04:17.590 --> 04:20.260
is that Indra's Heaven is not
just a place in the stars,

04:20.260 --> 04:22.630
that it's actually a spacecraft.

04:22.630 --> 04:25.140
And that Preah Pisnokar
was instructed

04:25.140 --> 04:27.850
by extraterrestrial beings
on this craft

04:27.850 --> 04:29.890
in the art of temple making.

04:29.890 --> 04:33.310
NARRATOR: According to ancient
astronaut theorists,

04:33.310 --> 04:35.440
an interesting parallel exists

04:35.440 --> 04:38.820
between the Mayan
and Cambodian stories.

04:38.820 --> 04:41.150
In the Maya manuscripts,

04:41.150 --> 04:45.910
the god Kukulkan is responsible
for their temple architecture.

04:45.910 --> 04:48.740
He was also credited
with educating humans

04:48.740 --> 04:51.750
on mathematics,
engineering and science,

04:51.750 --> 04:55.290
the same teachings
attributed to Pisnokar.

04:55.290 --> 04:59.090
ERICH VON DANIKEN: Kukulkan
is supposed to have descended

04:59.090 --> 05:00.710
from a star.

05:00.710 --> 05:04.470
He's represented
as the feathered serpent,

05:04.470 --> 05:06.840
but also he's represented,

05:06.840 --> 05:09.640
he's a big being
with the helmet,

05:09.640 --> 05:11.640
a helmet has rays on it,

05:11.640 --> 05:15.810
and he's sitting
on a half‐open sort of egg.

05:15.810 --> 05:19.980
He was the teacher, according
to Central American mythology.

05:19.980 --> 05:22.900
He definitely
is an extraterrestrial.

05:22.900 --> 05:25.860
NARRATOR: Could these
two otherworldly architects

05:25.860 --> 05:28.200
be one and the same?

05:28.200 --> 05:32.990
And if so, does further evidence
of a master builder exist

05:32.990 --> 05:36.210
in other parts
of the world as well?

05:36.210 --> 05:38.830
WILLIAM BRAMLEY:
In Mesoamerica,

05:38.830 --> 05:41.340
we have the gods associated
with the construction

05:41.340 --> 05:43.920
of the pyramids over there.

05:43.920 --> 05:46.550
This reflects
the same kind of entity

05:46.550 --> 05:48.720
that the Mesopotamians reported,

05:48.720 --> 05:52.850
that the Egyptians reported
as being the architect

05:52.850 --> 05:56.180
that designed the cities,
that designed these structures.

05:56.180 --> 06:00.480
So you have the same pattern
and the same claim

06:00.480 --> 06:02.650
happening over and over again

06:02.650 --> 06:06.820
over a span
of at least 7,000 years,

06:06.820 --> 06:09.870
where it's the same type of god,

06:09.870 --> 06:12.370
planning and directing
the construction

06:12.370 --> 06:15.790
of these types
of similar buildings.

06:15.790 --> 06:17.830
SILVA: We seem to be talking
about the same architect

06:17.830 --> 06:19.370
that seems to be crossing

06:19.370 --> 06:20.750
different continents
at different times.

06:20.750 --> 06:22.340
It's interesting
that when you start

06:22.340 --> 06:24.050
looking at all
of these structures

06:24.050 --> 06:26.130
covering many thousands
of years,

06:26.130 --> 06:28.260
you begin to see
that there's a relationship.

06:30.800 --> 06:32.930
NARRATOR: Pyramids are found
by the hundreds

06:32.930 --> 06:35.310
in nearly every region
of the world,

06:35.310 --> 06:37.310
including Central America,

06:37.310 --> 06:41.810
Mesopotamia, Egypt,

06:41.810 --> 06:46.780
China and even Antarctica.

06:46.780 --> 06:49.610
And many cultures'
most sacred structures

06:49.610 --> 06:52.490
appear remarkably alike.

06:52.490 --> 06:57.080
It is striking that you can
travel around the planet

06:57.080 --> 07:01.250
and you can find structures
that are similar in nature.

07:01.250 --> 07:03.420
For example, in China,

07:03.420 --> 07:06.050
the Xi'an Altar of Heaven,

07:06.050 --> 07:10.970
or the stone circle
above Saksaywaman in Peru.

07:10.970 --> 07:13.470
DAVID WILCOCK:
All over the planet,

07:13.470 --> 07:18.390
you see tall,
megalithic architecture.

07:18.390 --> 07:21.940
You see cyclopean stone
structures, as well.

07:21.940 --> 07:25.770
A bunch of primitive people
somehow get motivated

07:25.770 --> 07:27.820
all over the world
to haul around

07:27.820 --> 07:32.200
these gigantic blocks of stone
that could be 20 tons, 100 tons.

07:32.200 --> 07:34.070
And everybody around the world

07:34.070 --> 07:36.450
seemed to be doing
the same thing.

07:36.450 --> 07:39.450
CASSARO: There is a kind
of a master blueprint

07:39.450 --> 07:42.080
that we see in the architecture,

07:42.080 --> 07:45.170
and it's not in just one or two
or three civilizations,

07:45.170 --> 07:48.000
it's in all the civilizations.

07:48.000 --> 07:52.840
China, India, South America,
it's there.

07:52.840 --> 07:55.050
BRAMLEY:
Archeologists tell us, "Well,

07:55.050 --> 07:57.890
there was no connection
at those times."

07:57.890 --> 07:59.810
There had to be something,

07:59.810 --> 08:02.100
that's too much of
a coincidence.

08:02.100 --> 08:04.270
So there we get the idea
that it's more of a network

08:04.270 --> 08:05.770
than any single structure.

08:05.770 --> 08:08.530
And they sort of feed off
each other.

08:10.860 --> 08:13.320
NARRATOR: Are the curious
parallels between structures

08:13.320 --> 08:16.570
seen throughout the world
truly random,

08:16.570 --> 08:19.370
or could they be interconnected?

08:19.370 --> 08:22.750
And if so, was it important

08:22.750 --> 08:24.580
not just that the temples
were built,

08:24.580 --> 08:27.960
but exactly
how they were constructed?

08:34.680 --> 08:37.140
NARRATOR:
Cusco, Peru.

08:37.140 --> 08:41.350
The remnants of the Coricancha,
or Temple of the Sun,

08:41.350 --> 08:45.440
are considered a marvel
of Incan architecture.

08:45.440 --> 08:49.820
Modern engineers say
the precision of the stonework

08:49.820 --> 08:55.240
rivals that being produced today
with advanced machining.

08:55.240 --> 08:59.370
But incredibly, the Inca
weren't the only ancient people

08:59.370 --> 09:03.040
to achieve
such building proficiency.

09:05.290 --> 09:09.630
6,500 miles away in Giza, Egypt,

09:09.630 --> 09:12.510
we see the same signature
building techniques

09:12.510 --> 09:16.930
at the Valley Temple
next to the Sphinx.

09:16.930 --> 09:20.390
Let's say you stand in front
of the Sphinx temple in Egypt

09:20.390 --> 09:22.520
and you look
at the stone masonry there.

09:22.520 --> 09:25.730
And then you had the capability
of closing your eyes

09:25.730 --> 09:30.320
and the next moment you're at
the Coricancha temple in Cusco.

09:30.320 --> 09:32.860
Well, if you wouldn't know
where you are,

09:32.860 --> 09:35.150
you couldn't tell the difference
between the two,

09:35.150 --> 09:39.410
because the engineering styles
of those two temples

09:39.410 --> 09:42.910
are very similar.

09:42.910 --> 09:44.910
What you find is that the blocks

09:44.910 --> 09:46.410
are fitted together
so tightly...

10:09.060 --> 10:10.980
NARRATOR: What makes these
structures so impressive

10:10.980 --> 10:13.440
is not only their design,

10:13.440 --> 10:15.440
but also the fact

10:15.440 --> 10:19.950
that they were built
with megalithic stones.

10:19.950 --> 10:23.490
Some of these massive blocks
are so large

10:23.490 --> 10:25.580
that even engineers today

10:25.580 --> 10:30.000
have no idea
how they were put in place.

10:30.000 --> 10:32.420
The limestone blocks
at the Valley Temple

10:32.420 --> 10:37.420
are estimated to weigh
upwards of 200 tons each.

10:37.420 --> 10:40.640
And many of these stones
had to be lifted and placed

10:40.640 --> 10:43.350
up to 40 feet aboveground,

10:43.350 --> 10:45.600
or the height of
a four‐story building.

10:47.680 --> 10:52.560
However, this was not merely
accomplished at these two sites.

10:52.560 --> 10:56.440
Across the globe,
ancient cultures chose,

10:56.440 --> 10:58.570
time and time again,

10:58.570 --> 11:01.360
to build with similar
awe‐inspiring blocks

11:01.360 --> 11:04.030
fitted together
with minimal clearance

11:04.030 --> 11:06.870
between adjacent stones
and no use of mortar.

11:32.190 --> 11:34.360
NARRATOR:
Even more confounding

11:34.360 --> 11:38.360
is the fact that many of these
megalithic constructions

11:38.360 --> 11:40.400
were built
in impractical locations,

11:40.400 --> 11:43.200
often thousands of feet
above sea level.

11:49.870 --> 11:52.920
Santorini, Greece.

11:52.920 --> 11:56.750
Researcher and editor
Giorgio Tsoukalos

11:56.750 --> 11:58.550
traveled to the ancient site
of Thera

11:58.550 --> 12:02.510
on the island's highest peak.

12:02.510 --> 12:05.510
The megalithic architecture
found here

12:05.510 --> 12:10.810
dates back to at least
the ninth century BC.

12:10.810 --> 12:13.900
This wall exists here,

12:13.900 --> 12:17.610
at one of the most
inaccessible places.

12:17.610 --> 12:20.490
In order to get here,
you take a car,

12:20.490 --> 12:23.610
you go up these harrowing
switchback roads

12:23.610 --> 12:27.660
and then, you're on foot
for at least 45 minutes.

12:27.660 --> 12:30.120
And so the idea that is given

12:30.120 --> 12:32.580
that this was just
built on a whim,

12:32.580 --> 12:35.460
to me, seems insane.

12:35.460 --> 12:39.050
There had to have been
a reason why this is here.

12:39.050 --> 12:41.800
The blocks are huge.

12:41.800 --> 12:44.180
There is one block right here

12:44.180 --> 12:48.180
that's at least six feet long
and one here,

12:48.180 --> 12:49.560
seven feet long,

12:49.560 --> 12:52.560
and they're about
32 inches thick,

12:52.560 --> 12:54.190
so we're talking

12:54.190 --> 12:58.770
blocks of stone
that are as big as people,

12:58.770 --> 13:01.690
weighing about a ton or more.

13:01.690 --> 13:06.240
And we have 12 levels
of stone blocks.

13:06.240 --> 13:07.620
Twelve!

13:07.620 --> 13:10.240
This was placed
here deliberately.

13:10.240 --> 13:12.160
Deliberately.

13:12.160 --> 13:14.000
This is not coincidence.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.210
Somebody at the quarry said,

13:16.210 --> 13:19.340
"We need a stone of this
particular size,

13:19.340 --> 13:22.420
that fits right here."

13:22.420 --> 13:26.180
And walls like this
not only exist in Greece,

13:26.180 --> 13:29.680
but in Italy, in Spain,

13:29.680 --> 13:34.430
in South America,
and also in Egypt.

13:34.430 --> 13:37.520
So, the building style
is not similar,

13:37.520 --> 13:40.190
it is identical.

13:43.530 --> 13:46.150
NARRATOR:
The use of such enormous blocks

13:46.150 --> 13:49.200
is the main reason many
of these ancient structures,

13:49.200 --> 13:54.500
like the walls at Thera,
have survived until today.

13:54.500 --> 13:58.330
But why was it so important
that they remain standing

13:58.330 --> 14:00.460
thousands of years
into the future?

14:03.130 --> 14:04.630
There was an architect here

14:04.630 --> 14:07.930
who had complete understanding
of stone,

14:07.930 --> 14:11.260
of masonry, and that you can do
extraordinary things with it

14:11.260 --> 14:15.270
that will last a lifetime
and forever.

14:15.270 --> 14:17.980
Not only did they actually
build things

14:17.980 --> 14:22.150
which were guaranteed to last,

14:22.150 --> 14:25.150
often they were working
with unusual angles.

14:25.150 --> 14:27.280
And they're so tightly fitted

14:27.280 --> 14:30.240
that earthquakes find it very
difficult to break them apart.

14:30.240 --> 14:31.660
In fact, they are
earthquake‐proof.

14:37.460 --> 14:40.710
NARRATOR: Ancient astronaut
theorists point out that other

14:40.710 --> 14:44.050
common design elements were
incorporated in structures

14:44.050 --> 14:47.800
throughout the world
to ensure their longevity,

14:47.800 --> 14:51.720
including the widespread use
of metal braces

14:51.720 --> 14:54.760
inserted into keystone cuts

14:54.760 --> 14:57.680
to reinforce
ancient constructions.

14:57.680 --> 15:02.440
This unusual way of fitting
large stones together

15:02.440 --> 15:05.230
is found in ancient Egypt,

15:05.230 --> 15:07.530
it's found in ancient Ethiopia.

15:07.530 --> 15:12.990
It is found in India
and Greece and in Italy.

15:12.990 --> 15:15.030
It is found at Angkor Wat
in Cambodia.

15:15.030 --> 15:19.500
It's found at the Champa sites
in Vietnam,

15:19.500 --> 15:22.130
and we find it in Peru

15:22.130 --> 15:25.130
at Ollantaytambo and at Cusco,

15:25.130 --> 15:27.760
and we see it also at Tiwanaku

15:27.760 --> 15:31.300
and Puma Punku in Bolivia.

15:31.300 --> 15:33.970
SILVA:
The two stones essentially have

15:33.970 --> 15:36.260
a channel dug in between them,

15:36.260 --> 15:41.140
and there's a certain slot into
which is poured molten metal.

15:41.140 --> 15:43.770
Now, this brings up all kinds
of questions because, one,

15:43.770 --> 15:45.440
alloys were not supposed
to have been discovered

15:45.440 --> 15:48.150
until about 2500 BC.

15:48.150 --> 15:52.200
The fact that these stones
go back to at least 13,000 BC

15:52.200 --> 15:53.870
creates a huge problem.

15:53.870 --> 15:56.160
We have here, again,
shared technology

15:56.160 --> 15:58.540
crossing a huge span of time

15:58.540 --> 16:01.120
in order to make sure that the
stones never, ever fall apart.

16:03.750 --> 16:07.880
People working on different
sides of the world

16:07.880 --> 16:10.260
trying to build similar things

16:10.260 --> 16:13.010
are not necessarily going
to think of the same way

16:13.010 --> 16:15.640
to build it in certain respects.

16:17.850 --> 16:19.930
The similarities in the way
some of the stones were cut,

16:19.930 --> 16:21.980
the keystone,

16:21.980 --> 16:26.440
other factors that people
wouldn't necessarily think of,

16:26.440 --> 16:28.770
for them to show up,
and for them to be used

16:28.770 --> 16:31.690
to give greater duration
to these structures

16:31.690 --> 16:34.780
way beyond any
reasonable expectation

16:34.780 --> 16:38.240
that the people living then were
gonna continue to use these,

16:38.240 --> 16:41.330
tells us that there's somebody
maybe with a longer time span

16:41.330 --> 16:44.210
was behind the design
of these things.

16:44.210 --> 16:46.330
Whoever was behind the design

16:46.330 --> 16:50.550
wanted these things
to last a really long time.

16:50.550 --> 16:55.090
Who were the teachers
of these engineering styles?

16:55.090 --> 17:00.350
The only conclusion there is,
is that aliens had a hand

17:00.350 --> 17:03.890
in these creations
a long time ago.

17:03.890 --> 17:05.350
They're all human‐made,

17:05.350 --> 17:08.150
but with the assistance
or the technology

17:08.150 --> 17:09.860
provided by extraterrestrials.

17:14.240 --> 17:17.620
NARRATOR: If ancient structures
found all over the world

17:17.620 --> 17:21.330
were built to outlast the beings
that constructed them,

17:21.330 --> 17:24.160
is it possible
that they were meant to serve

17:24.160 --> 17:26.330
a greater purpose,

17:26.330 --> 17:30.000
one not known to
the builders themselves,

17:30.000 --> 17:32.380
but only to those who
instructed them?

17:41.680 --> 17:45.350
NARRATOR:
Giza Plateau, Egypt.

17:45.350 --> 17:49.560
The Great Pyramid is arguably
the most enigmatic structure

17:49.560 --> 17:51.690
on the face of the Earth.

17:51.690 --> 17:56.200
It is the only surviving
Wonder of the ancient world,

17:56.200 --> 17:59.200
and has inspired
endless speculation

17:59.200 --> 18:03.950
as to how it was built
and what purpose it served.

18:03.950 --> 18:07.960
Ever since the first studies
of the Great Pyramid in Egypt

18:07.960 --> 18:11.790
have been made,
researchers have been amazed

18:11.790 --> 18:15.090
at the mathematical knowledge
that is encoded

18:15.090 --> 18:17.340
into the Great Pyramid,

18:17.340 --> 18:19.760
the measurements
that are used in it.

18:19.760 --> 18:22.720
Even the placement
of the Great Pyramid

18:22.720 --> 18:26.480
has aroused great interest
among Egyptologists.

18:26.480 --> 18:29.480
NARRATOR:
The Great Pyramid is aligned

18:29.480 --> 18:33.070
to within 3/60ths
of a degree of north,

18:33.070 --> 18:37.650
a more accurate alignment than
any other structure on Earth.

18:37.650 --> 18:40.910
When you look at the
Great Pyramid's alignment,

18:40.910 --> 18:43.240
it's aligned very, very close
to true north.

18:43.240 --> 18:45.580
Even more interesting
is to think about

18:45.580 --> 18:48.080
tracking back in time,
because the Earth's axis

18:48.080 --> 18:49.620
has been shifting slowly.

18:49.620 --> 18:51.630
It's what we call "precessis."

18:51.630 --> 18:53.840
And so, if there's been
a shift in that alignment,

18:53.840 --> 18:57.050
it could be that it was even
more accurately aligned to north

18:57.050 --> 18:58.720
in the past when they built it.

19:00.800 --> 19:03.680
NARRATOR :The Great Pyramid
is not only perfectly aligned

19:03.680 --> 19:05.970
to the cardinal points,

19:05.970 --> 19:09.140
its placement on the Earth is
seemingly intentional as well.

19:10.980 --> 19:13.360
CREIGHTON:
If you pass a great circle

19:13.360 --> 19:15.270
from the Great Pyramid
through...

19:39.010 --> 19:40.880
NARRATOR:
Since the first accurate survey

19:40.880 --> 19:44.180
of the Great Pyramid in 1925,

19:44.180 --> 19:47.220
mathematicians and researchers
have discovered

19:47.220 --> 19:49.270
even more profound connections

19:49.270 --> 19:51.770
relating to geodetic
information,

19:51.770 --> 19:54.520
or information pertaining
to the measurement

19:54.520 --> 19:58.070
and representation of the Earth,
encoded in its design.

20:00.320 --> 20:02.410
The Great Pyramid
was built with a level

20:02.410 --> 20:06.030
of technological sophistication
far in excess

20:06.030 --> 20:08.370
of anything that we have today.

20:08.370 --> 20:10.910
They don't use the inch

20:10.910 --> 20:13.420
as we normally have it
in the English system;

20:13.420 --> 20:14.920
it's the cubit.

20:14.920 --> 20:17.170
And what's interesting
about the cubit

20:17.170 --> 20:20.670
is that it is exactly
1/25 millionth

20:20.670 --> 20:22.590
of the polar diameter
of the earth,

20:22.590 --> 20:24.010
meaning the distance
from the North Pole

20:24.010 --> 20:25.470
to the South Pole of the Earth.

20:25.470 --> 20:27.470
Chop it up into
25 million pieces,

20:27.470 --> 20:29.470
there's a royal cubit.

20:29.470 --> 20:31.850
It's perfect.

20:31.850 --> 20:34.480
If you actually take
the length of the Great Pyramid

20:34.480 --> 20:36.190
at its mean Socket level,

20:36.190 --> 20:38.480
which is the corners
of the actual building,

20:38.480 --> 20:42.990
it translates into
365.24 pyramid cubits,

20:42.990 --> 20:45.320
which just happens to be
the Earth year,

20:45.320 --> 20:48.240
right down to a quarter day.

20:52.000 --> 20:53.660
NARRATOR: The measurements
of the length

20:53.660 --> 20:56.540
and width of the perimeter
of the Great Pyramid

20:56.540 --> 21:00.090
correspond to an exact fraction
of the both the latitude

21:00.090 --> 21:03.840
and longitude measurements
at the equator.

21:03.840 --> 21:08.430
Scaled up, this means the Great
Pyramid directly corresponds

21:08.430 --> 21:10.600
to the circumference
of the equator,

21:10.600 --> 21:14.020
as well as the measurement
from the Equator to the Pole,

21:14.020 --> 21:17.650
making it a scale model
of the Northern Hemisphere.

21:22.320 --> 21:25.450
Recently, using
satellite technology,

21:25.450 --> 21:28.070
researchers have realized
yet another

21:28.070 --> 21:32.200
advanced formula encoded
in the design.

21:32.200 --> 21:33.870
If you take the location

21:33.870 --> 21:35.540
of the Great Pyramid
as a coordinate,

21:35.540 --> 21:38.830
this number sequence
of this coordinate

21:38.830 --> 21:43.210
matches exactly the speed of
light traveling through space,

21:43.210 --> 21:45.170
measured in meters per second.

21:45.170 --> 21:47.300
This is amazing stuff.

21:49.470 --> 21:52.220
When you consider the vast
amount of information

21:52.220 --> 21:56.190
about the Earth that's encoded
into the Great Pyramid,

21:56.190 --> 22:00.190
you can't just dismiss all
of this as pure coincidence.

22:03.190 --> 22:06.530
NARRATOR: Although the Great
Pyramid at Giza offers

22:06.530 --> 22:09.570
an astounding example
of encoded information,

22:09.570 --> 22:11.580
other sites around the world,

22:11.580 --> 22:14.250
such as the Mesoamerican
pyramids

22:14.250 --> 22:17.160
and the ziggurats
of Mesopotamia,

22:17.160 --> 22:19.170
have also been found
to be aligned

22:19.170 --> 22:21.130
to exact cardinal points,

22:21.130 --> 22:24.170
and embody mathematical
concepts.

22:26.340 --> 22:30.340
These buildings were built
under divine guidance.

22:32.010 --> 22:33.760
This is a mark of the gods.

22:33.760 --> 22:36.980
They put certain things in these
buildings to let us know

22:36.980 --> 22:40.150
they are not entirely
of human origin.

22:40.150 --> 22:43.980
They represent something larger
than we are.

22:43.980 --> 22:48.360
The builders wanted to make sure
that a future generation

22:48.360 --> 22:52.450
would know that there's
a discrepancy in knowledge.

22:52.450 --> 22:55.700
And what I'm suggesting is that
all these ancient structures

22:55.700 --> 22:59.960
are calling cards left
by extraterrestrials.

22:59.960 --> 23:04.550
NARRATOR: Ancient astronaut
theorists suggest that evidence

23:04.550 --> 23:07.840
of extraterrestrial intervention
in the construction

23:07.840 --> 23:10.930
and placement of these
incredible structures

23:10.930 --> 23:15.310
can also be found by examining
their alignments with the stars.

23:17.390 --> 23:19.850
TSOUKALOS:
If I wanted to leave behind

23:19.850 --> 23:23.440
a piece of evidence
that suggests

23:23.440 --> 23:28.030
where I'm from,
one way, for example,

23:28.030 --> 23:29.900
is by creating monuments

23:29.900 --> 23:32.870
that are in the shape
of constellations.

23:32.870 --> 23:37.620
In ancient Egypt,
the three pyramids are aligned

23:37.620 --> 23:40.920
with the constellation
of Orion's belt.

23:40.920 --> 23:43.290
The pyramids are not
the only monuments

23:43.290 --> 23:46.800
that have this
particular configuration.

23:46.800 --> 23:51.970
NARRATOR: The ancient site
of Teotihuacan, in Mexico,

23:51.970 --> 23:55.430
also contains three pyramids
that are oriented

23:55.430 --> 23:58.350
to match up with the belt stars
of Orion.

23:58.350 --> 24:02.480
And other sites throughout
the world have been found

24:02.480 --> 24:05.110
to have similar
astronomical alignments.

24:09.610 --> 24:11.200
NARRATOR:
Were ancient structures,

24:11.200 --> 24:13.780
and even entire complexes,

24:13.780 --> 24:16.530
purposely encoded
with advanced principles

24:16.530 --> 24:19.160
so that future generations
would recognize

24:19.160 --> 24:22.830
an otherworldly influence?

24:22.830 --> 24:26.040
Ancient astronaut
theorists say yes,

24:26.040 --> 24:29.380
but suggest an even more
profound purpose

24:29.380 --> 24:33.010
might be revealed by examining
these structures

24:33.010 --> 24:36.140
from an extraterrestrial
perspective.

24:45.440 --> 24:48.480
NARRATOR: Saint‐Jean‐de‐Matha,
Quebec, Canada.

24:48.480 --> 24:51.650
May, 2016.

24:51.650 --> 24:54.660
After extensively studying
the manuscripts

24:54.660 --> 24:57.450
of the ancient
Mayan civilization

24:57.450 --> 25:00.830
that reached its peak
in 1000 AD,

25:00.830 --> 25:04.160
15‐year‐old student
William Gadoury

25:04.160 --> 25:07.420
stumbles across
something astonishing.

25:07.420 --> 25:11.090
The star diagrams contained
in the documents

25:11.090 --> 25:15.970
perfectly correlate with the
layout of existing Mayan cities.

25:15.970 --> 25:18.430
WILCOCK: Gadoury discovered
that there were

25:18.430 --> 25:20.310
22 star maps in the texts

25:20.310 --> 25:22.730
that lined up with the cities
very nicely‐‐

25:22.730 --> 25:24.390
117 different cities.

25:24.390 --> 25:28.400
But there was a 23rd map,

25:28.400 --> 25:31.230
in which one of the cities

25:31.230 --> 25:34.400
did not exist on the map.

25:34.400 --> 25:36.950
Now, he was really concerned
about this because

25:36.950 --> 25:40.490
he felt, wait a minute,
this is like a treasure map,

25:40.490 --> 25:43.700
and "X" marks the spot.

25:43.700 --> 25:47.250
NARRATOR: Gadoury found it odd
that only one star on the maps

25:47.250 --> 25:50.380
did not match up
with a Mayan city,

25:50.380 --> 25:53.340
and concluded that perhaps
it really did exist,

25:53.340 --> 25:57.050
but had not yet been discovered.

25:57.050 --> 26:00.140
With the assistance
of the Canadian Space Agency

26:00.140 --> 26:03.520
and Dr. Armand Larocque,
a remote‐sensing specialist

26:03.520 --> 26:05.640
from the University
of New Brunswick,

26:05.640 --> 26:08.850
Gadoury was able to use
satellite imagery

26:08.850 --> 26:11.230
to pinpoint
the exact coordinates

26:11.230 --> 26:14.110
where the city should be.

26:14.110 --> 26:18.410
WILCOCK: What they see is
absolutely mind‐blowing.

26:18.410 --> 26:22.660
There it is, a perfect
square object.

26:22.660 --> 26:25.750
It's clearly angular,
it's clearly geometric.

26:25.750 --> 26:28.420
It has symmetrical proportions
on both sides.

26:28.420 --> 26:32.540
This square, according
to Dr. Armand Larocque himself,

26:32.540 --> 26:37.510
could actually be the foundation
of a pyramid.

26:37.510 --> 26:40.470
NARRATOR: Although
archaeologists have yet

26:40.470 --> 26:42.600
to visit the site,

26:42.600 --> 26:46.770
the lost city was given the name
K'aak Chi, or "Mouth of Fire."

26:51.230 --> 26:53.650
Gadoury's discovery
would seem to confirm

26:53.650 --> 26:56.530
that the Maya precisely
placed their cities

26:56.530 --> 27:00.110
in a way that perfectly mirrored
the stars above‐‐

27:00.110 --> 27:03.830
an astonishing accomplishment
considering that the territory

27:03.830 --> 27:08.410
they occupied spans
over 75,000 square miles.

27:10.580 --> 27:13.710
We have the entirety
of all Mayan civilization,

27:13.710 --> 27:17.590
every one of those cities,
perfectly gridded out,

27:17.590 --> 27:21.260
mathematical precision
with star maps.

27:21.260 --> 27:25.430
How could a primitive culture
have done this?

27:25.430 --> 27:27.600
NARRATOR:
Ancient astronaut theorists say

27:27.600 --> 27:30.520
the Maya were told
where to build their cities

27:30.520 --> 27:32.980
by extraterrestrial visitors,

27:32.980 --> 27:36.020
and suggest that this occurred
with other civilizations

27:36.020 --> 27:38.990
throughout the world.

27:38.990 --> 27:42.410
But it was not only the stars
that determined the placement

27:42.410 --> 27:44.910
of important sites.

27:44.910 --> 27:49.830
Many were also aligned with the
very energy of the Earth itself.

27:54.840 --> 28:00.170
NARRATOR:
Herefordshire, England, 1921.

28:00.170 --> 28:03.550
Alfred Watkins,
a landscape photographer,

28:03.550 --> 28:06.140
makes a curious discovery.

28:06.140 --> 28:11.810
Many of the prehistoric standing
stones, mounds, forts,

28:11.810 --> 28:15.770
and earthworks in the area fall
directly in a straight line

28:15.770 --> 28:18.900
extending for several miles.

28:18.900 --> 28:23.950
He coins the term "ley lines"
to describe these alignments,

28:23.950 --> 28:27.910
which he later finds
throughout England and France.

28:27.910 --> 28:31.000
WILCOCK: These so‐called
ley lines actually cross over

28:31.000 --> 28:34.040
all of the ancient
stone structures,

28:34.040 --> 28:37.670
like Stonehenge or Avebury.

28:37.670 --> 28:42.760
Something is going on here in
which this idea of these lines

28:42.760 --> 28:45.090
has some relevance.

28:45.090 --> 28:49.770
We see that the Templars
borrowed this same science

28:49.770 --> 28:52.850
of grid lines
during the Crusades,

28:52.850 --> 28:54.600
and then started to build

28:54.600 --> 28:57.400
all of the cathedrals
throughout Europe

28:57.400 --> 29:01.280
on these so‐called ley lines.

29:01.280 --> 29:04.990
Ancient cultures had
this understanding

29:04.990 --> 29:09.120
that the world has
lines of power to it.

29:09.120 --> 29:12.790
The ancient cultures understood
that these lines of power

29:12.790 --> 29:15.330
were almost like
sources of energy,

29:15.330 --> 29:18.380
and by building structures
along these sources of energy,

29:18.380 --> 29:20.090
they could almost tap its power.

29:21.840 --> 29:26.390
NARRATOR: In 1992,
after 30 years of visiting

29:26.390 --> 29:29.850
the megalithic standing stones
in the Carnac region of France

29:29.850 --> 29:33.520
and hearing stories about
energetic ley lines,

29:33.520 --> 29:36.560
thermodynamics engineer
Pierre Mereaux

29:36.560 --> 29:41.900
sets out to discover if there is
any truth to the theory.

29:41.900 --> 29:43.940
Mereaux actually went
to Carnac in France,

29:43.940 --> 29:46.910
where there's at least
80,000 standing stones.

29:46.910 --> 29:49.990
And, as a skeptic, he actually
measured the energy

29:49.990 --> 29:52.580
of these stones and found that
these stones actually act

29:52.580 --> 29:55.960
as batteries, as coils,
as alternators.

29:55.960 --> 30:00.130
They store energy, and they also
allow the energy to expand

30:00.130 --> 30:01.840
at certain times during the day,

30:01.840 --> 30:03.840
demonstrating that
the stones are built

30:03.840 --> 30:06.930
exactly where they need to be
to harness a specific energy.

30:08.800 --> 30:11.760
NARRATOR: If extraterrestrials
instructed our ancestors

30:11.760 --> 30:14.730
on where to build their most
important structures,

30:14.730 --> 30:18.560
as ancient astronaut
theorists suggest,

30:18.560 --> 30:20.690
was it to exploit
the power of the site?

30:22.770 --> 30:26.070
Perhaps further clues
can be found by examining

30:26.070 --> 30:28.950
what many consider
to be the holiest

30:28.950 --> 30:31.990
and most contentious site
on the planet.

30:40.290 --> 30:42.670
NARRATOR:
Chichen Itza, Mexico.

30:42.670 --> 30:45.760
August, 2015.

30:45.760 --> 30:49.840
A sinkhole is discovered
under the 1,000‐year‐old

30:49.840 --> 30:52.640
El Castillo temple.

30:52.640 --> 30:56.270
Scientists, worried about
the stability of the pyramid,

30:56.270 --> 31:01.270
begin extensive examinations
of the site.

31:01.270 --> 31:05.690
While investigating, they
discovered two nested structures

31:05.690 --> 31:08.450
contained within the confines
of the pyramid.

31:10.280 --> 31:12.280
SILVA: The pyramid
at Chichen Itza is actually

31:12.280 --> 31:13.870
not one pyramid, but three.

31:13.870 --> 31:16.120
These are built
like Russian dolls.

31:16.120 --> 31:18.370
They keep repeating
the same design feature,

31:18.370 --> 31:20.000
the same construction method,

31:20.000 --> 31:21.790
the same unit of measure
over time.

31:21.790 --> 31:24.840
So obviously, something worked
thousands of years ago

31:24.840 --> 31:27.050
and they kept repeating it
again, and again, and again

31:27.050 --> 31:31.130
like a cookie cutter process.

31:31.130 --> 31:36.640
It is a pyramid that's inside
of another pyramid.

31:36.640 --> 31:40.640
We also see this
at the Great Pyramid of Cholula,

31:40.640 --> 31:43.440
one of the largest pyramids
in the world,

31:43.440 --> 31:45.980
just outside of Mexico City.

31:45.980 --> 31:50.070
Also, we see this
at Djoser's Pyramid

31:50.070 --> 31:53.620
in Saqqara in Egypt.

31:53.620 --> 31:56.740
So ancient peoples were,
for some reason,

31:56.740 --> 32:02.460
rebuilding over and over again
these ancient structures.

32:02.460 --> 32:05.210
Because they apparently
were in a location

32:05.210 --> 32:08.090
that was so important.

32:08.090 --> 32:13.260
There's something special
about that place.

32:16.890 --> 32:20.850
NARRATOR: Throughout the world,
evidence of sacred sites

32:20.850 --> 32:23.190
that have transcended
various cultures

32:23.190 --> 32:28.110
and religious traditions
can be found.

32:28.110 --> 32:32.200
The Temple Mount is considered
holy to all the world religions.

32:34.320 --> 32:37.580
The Temple of Solomon was built.

32:37.580 --> 32:43.120
Later, Christianity built
their own churches upon it.

32:43.120 --> 32:46.590
This is where the prophet
of Islam, Muhammad,

32:46.590 --> 32:49.960
had a vision wherein which
he ascended to heaven.

32:49.960 --> 32:52.590
And it was upon this vision

32:52.590 --> 32:58.470
that proclaimed the Temple Mount
to be sacred to Islam.

32:58.470 --> 33:02.140
But it was considered sacred
before the ancient Israelites

33:02.140 --> 33:04.810
even came into the land
of Israel.

33:04.810 --> 33:06.860
We read in the Bible

33:06.860 --> 33:10.730
about Abraham meeting
a very strange priest

33:10.730 --> 33:13.240
by the name of Melchizedek,

33:13.240 --> 33:17.240
who was to have had
his own temple there.

33:17.240 --> 33:19.660
So there was
a very ancient connection

33:19.660 --> 33:25.170
to this specific place.

33:25.170 --> 33:28.920
In Lebanon,
there is the temple to Baalbek.

33:28.920 --> 33:31.420
Later, under Greek control

33:31.420 --> 33:34.760
they built a different structure
on the same foundation stone,

33:34.760 --> 33:37.260
and called the area Heliopolis.

33:37.260 --> 33:39.470
There are cathedrals
throughout the world

33:39.470 --> 33:42.220
that had pre‐Christian
foundations.

33:42.220 --> 33:44.060
We have it all over the world,

33:44.060 --> 33:48.610
which means that a sacred site
has a power of its own

33:48.610 --> 33:50.940
that is larger or older

33:50.940 --> 33:55.110
or longer lasting
than any particular tradition.

33:55.110 --> 33:57.950
The thing is,
the location is what's sacred.

34:00.120 --> 34:02.490
NARRATOR:
Could it be that,

34:02.490 --> 34:04.450
much like the locations
of the Mayan cities

34:04.450 --> 34:07.210
that are mapped out
based on a cosmic grid

34:07.210 --> 34:10.380
and the ley lines in England,

34:10.380 --> 34:12.590
these worldwide sacred sites

34:12.590 --> 34:15.920
also connect
to a larger blueprint?

34:15.920 --> 34:19.930
The origins of the idea
of a world grid

34:19.930 --> 34:24.930
can be traced back
to ancient Greece.

34:24.930 --> 34:28.060
Philosophers like Plato
were very adamant

34:28.060 --> 34:31.520
that the ancient sacred places
were specially positioned

34:31.520 --> 34:34.150
along the face of the Earth
in a very deliberate way,

34:34.150 --> 34:36.950
and they conformed
to what was called a world grid.

34:36.950 --> 34:38.950
The temples were not
placed haphazardly.

34:38.950 --> 34:42.280
They actually had a structure
and purpose to them.

34:44.620 --> 34:46.500
NARRATOR:
In the 1960s,

34:46.500 --> 34:49.670
researcher
Ivan T. Sanderson plotted out

34:49.670 --> 34:54.090
his own planetary grid
based on Plato's work.

34:54.090 --> 34:55.710
Other world grid researchers

34:55.710 --> 35:00.050
would later build
upon his model.

35:00.050 --> 35:04.850
What they identified was that
there was a geometric pattern

35:04.850 --> 35:07.850
that could be superimposed
on the Earth,

35:07.850 --> 35:11.400
and that grid point
usually started

35:11.400 --> 35:14.070
at the Great Pyramid itself.

35:14.070 --> 35:18.530
And they would go out from there
in a geometric form.

35:18.530 --> 35:22.820
WILCOCK: Russian researchers
did a full survey

35:22.820 --> 35:26.040
of all of the large
stone structures

35:26.040 --> 35:28.830
that have ever been found
all over the Earth,

35:28.830 --> 35:34.040
a total of 3,300
different stone structures.

35:34.040 --> 35:37.010
And they found
that every single one of them

35:37.010 --> 35:40.130
was built right
on one of the lines

35:40.130 --> 35:41.800
of this geometric pattern.

35:41.800 --> 35:45.100
CHILDRESS:
On this grid,

35:45.100 --> 35:48.680
sites like Stonehenge
in England,

35:48.680 --> 35:52.690
megaliths in West Africa,

35:52.690 --> 35:54.900
the Bermuda Triangle,

35:54.900 --> 35:57.900
pyramids in Mexico and in Peru,

35:57.900 --> 36:00.700
islands like Easter Island.

36:00.700 --> 36:03.200
the bizarre city of Nan Madol,

36:03.200 --> 36:07.990
were also matching this grid.

36:07.990 --> 36:10.710
The specific power spots
where we find pyramids

36:10.710 --> 36:13.420
and obelisks
and other structures,

36:13.420 --> 36:15.540
may have not been chosen
just by chance.

36:15.540 --> 36:18.800
It could well be that they are
part of an integrated whole

36:18.800 --> 36:22.680
and their location
is highly, highly important.

36:22.680 --> 36:25.720
Some researchers speculate
that ancient cultures

36:25.720 --> 36:28.100
around the world

36:28.100 --> 36:30.810
connected all of their temples
to each other,

36:30.810 --> 36:32.980
almost like
a master circuit board,

36:32.980 --> 36:36.400
where one temple connected
to another temple,

36:36.400 --> 36:40.150
connected to another, added
to the power of the structure,

36:40.150 --> 36:42.740
added to the power
of the line itself.

36:45.070 --> 36:47.490
HENRY:
When we think of the power grid,

36:47.490 --> 36:51.620
we think of the energy being
transmitted along this grid.

36:51.620 --> 36:53.460
What if there's
something else going on here?

36:53.460 --> 36:55.960
What if there's something bigger
that we're not seeing?

36:55.960 --> 36:57.710
What if this world power grid

36:57.710 --> 37:00.710
is actually receiving energy
from the solar system

37:00.710 --> 37:02.840
or from the universe itself?

37:02.840 --> 37:04.970
CHILDRESS:
You have to ask yourself,

37:04.970 --> 37:08.760
who is it who's overseeing
this larger picture

37:08.760 --> 37:11.310
of all of these structures
on the Earth?

37:11.310 --> 37:14.480
They're somehow looking
at the Earth from space

37:14.480 --> 37:17.770
and seeing
how these structures would fit

37:17.770 --> 37:21.440
on a large scale
around the globe.

37:21.440 --> 37:24.860
Who could be doing this,
except for extraterrestrials?

37:27.370 --> 37:30.080
NARRATOR: If the placement
of structures on Earth

37:30.080 --> 37:32.250
were specifically plotted
to serve

37:32.250 --> 37:35.000
an extraterrestrial function,

37:35.000 --> 37:39.340
might parts of this system
still be online today?

37:39.340 --> 37:44.260
And if so, does it serve
a purpose beyond Earth?

37:50.310 --> 37:54.480
NARRATOR:
Auckland, New Zealand, 1997.

37:54.480 --> 37:59.810
Retired military and commercial
airline pilot Bruce Cathie

37:59.810 --> 38:03.690
publishes his book
<i>The Energy Grid.</i>

38:03.690 --> 38:07.910
In it, he details his experience
observing UFOs

38:07.910 --> 38:12.330
during his time working
for the New Zealand military.

38:12.330 --> 38:17.580
He noted that these crafts were
always following straight lines.

38:17.580 --> 38:19.460
After mapping them,

38:19.460 --> 38:24.340
he discovered that they followed
a distinctive grid pattern.

38:24.340 --> 38:27.760
Additionally, while flying over
some of these zones,

38:27.760 --> 38:30.550
he also noticed
that various structures

38:30.550 --> 38:34.350
were actively being built
along the paths.

38:34.350 --> 38:37.390
CHILDRESS:
Bruce Cathie maintained

38:37.390 --> 38:40.810
that the American military,
starting in World War II,

38:40.810 --> 38:43.110
had also figured out

38:43.110 --> 38:47.700
this special grid that surrounds
the entire planet,

38:47.700 --> 38:51.950
and that the military was using
certain spots on the Earth

38:51.950 --> 38:54.740
to build military bases
and other structures.

38:57.210 --> 39:01.290
NARRATOR: Cathie suggested
that the extraterrestrial craft

39:01.290 --> 39:04.300
may have been drawing power
off the grid,

39:04.300 --> 39:07.590
and that after World War II
and the Roswell incident,

39:07.590 --> 39:10.260
military personnel
around the world

39:10.260 --> 39:15.100
had become aware
of this UFO connection.

39:15.100 --> 39:18.480
So here we have
an ancient grid structure,

39:18.480 --> 39:21.600
probably built
by extraterrestrials,

39:21.600 --> 39:25.730
possibly to power their craft,

39:25.730 --> 39:29.240
that's now being
reconstructed today

39:29.240 --> 39:32.700
by the military.

39:34.450 --> 39:38.120
NARRATOR: Could it be
that ancient structures

39:38.120 --> 39:41.620
throughout the world were
designed to function together

39:41.620 --> 39:44.500
as part of
a massive energy grid?

39:44.500 --> 39:47.170
And did the architects

39:47.170 --> 39:50.930
intentionally leave behind
information for us to find,

39:50.930 --> 39:53.180
once we had
the technological knowledge

39:53.180 --> 39:55.560
to recognize this system?

39:55.560 --> 39:57.640
But why?

39:57.640 --> 40:03.060
What were the alien architects
trying to tell us?

40:03.060 --> 40:07.440
Extraterrestrials knew that
at some point in our evolution,

40:07.440 --> 40:10.650
a technologically
advanced society

40:10.650 --> 40:14.160
would stumble across
all of these ancient sites

40:14.160 --> 40:16.580
and see their correlation,

40:16.580 --> 40:23.120
thus forcing us to take
into consideration

40:23.120 --> 40:25.210
that some type
of extraterrestrials

40:25.210 --> 40:29.710
showed our ancestors where
to build these things,

40:29.710 --> 40:32.510
not for them, but for us.

40:34.760 --> 40:36.970
The grid itself may, in fact,

40:36.970 --> 40:39.520
be a source
of unconventional energy

40:39.520 --> 40:42.600
that we are not
necessarily utilizing

40:42.600 --> 40:44.900
with our technology now.

40:44.900 --> 40:48.900
An advanced, intelligent race
wanted to leave something behind

40:48.900 --> 40:51.740
for us to discover
that would give us the clues

40:51.740 --> 40:56.200
to a greater level of science
than we now understand.

40:56.200 --> 40:59.040
It could be
that this master architect

40:59.040 --> 41:01.000
sought not only to influence
the Earth,

41:01.000 --> 41:04.250
but also to connect the Earth
to something greater

41:04.250 --> 41:06.380
or beyond our imagination.

41:06.380 --> 41:10.250
Perhaps this grid even extends
out into the stars,

41:10.250 --> 41:13.420
and the world grid of the Earth
connects with the grid

41:13.420 --> 41:17.300
of other planets as well,
and then integrates the Earth

41:17.300 --> 41:20.220
into a huge colony, if you will,

41:20.220 --> 41:24.020
or integrated circuit
throughout the cosmos.

41:24.020 --> 41:26.900
CHILDRESS: This will be
profound for planet Earth,

41:26.900 --> 41:31.860
when this grid network
is repowered,

41:31.860 --> 41:33.950
and we don't know what effect

41:33.950 --> 41:37.660
it will ultimately have
on our future.

41:37.660 --> 41:42.410
Maybe this will be the time when
the extraterrestrials return.

41:42.410 --> 41:44.960
NARRATOR:
There are those who believe

41:44.960 --> 41:47.290
that the discovery
of an ancient energy grid

41:47.290 --> 41:51.000
will offer a quantum leap
in human achievement.

41:51.000 --> 41:54.300
Because by harnessing the energy
of the Earth,

41:54.300 --> 41:57.720
we will not only advance
beyond our planet,

41:57.720 --> 42:00.720
but far beyond the stars,

42:00.720 --> 42:04.100
and anything
we could ever imagine.
