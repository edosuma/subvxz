CHRIS ROCK:
Ever since I was a kid,
I always loved comedy.

00:04.538 --> 00:06.174
I loved cartoons.

00:07.508 --> 00:10.411
I loved sitcoms.

00:10.444 --> 00:12.480
Sunday's supposed to be my day
of rest, you know.

00:12.513 --> 00:16.417
But most of all,
I loved stand-up comedians.

00:16.450 --> 00:18.752
Michael Jackson kept his
sunglasses on.

00:18.786 --> 00:21.122
He had to-- Cyndi Lauper
kept shining in his eyes.

00:23.157 --> 00:24.692
All right, y'all,
time to go to bed.

00:26.727 --> 00:29.130
Ma, can I stay up
and watch 'til the end?

00:29.163 --> 00:30.364
It's almost over.

00:30.398 --> 00:31.532
All right.

00:31.565 --> 00:32.833
Drew and Tonya, go.

00:32.866 --> 00:35.169
Good night.

00:36.804 --> 00:38.106
And Prince didn't show up.

00:38.139 --> 00:39.340
He doesn't like to go anywhere

00:39.373 --> 00:40.674
where the cast
outnumbers his bodyguard.

00:40.708 --> 00:44.445
What I didn't know was that my
parents loved comedians, too.

00:44.478 --> 00:47.815
REDD FOXX :
You knew it in your heart,
you haven't washed your hair.

00:51.219 --> 00:53.187
* Express yourself

00:58.392 --> 01:00.461
FOXX:
So one night,
the time was right,

01:00.494 --> 01:03.097
he asked her, he said,
"Honey, would you marry me?"

01:03.131 --> 01:04.565
She said "wooden eye?"

01:04.598 --> 01:06.334
I can't say what he just,

01:06.367 --> 01:09.870
but it was the first dirty joke
I had ever heard.

01:09.903 --> 01:12.140
"Geez, baby, what time
do you have to be home?"

01:12.173 --> 01:13.474
And it wasn't the last.

01:13.507 --> 01:15.476
She said "Christmas..."

01:15.509 --> 01:17.745
A lot of kids would get
in trouble sneaking out of bed

01:17.778 --> 01:19.480
trying to listen
to dirty jokes.

01:19.513 --> 01:21.349
I ended up getting a career.

01:21.382 --> 01:25.353

CHRIS ROCK:
I risked a beating

01:56.584 --> 01:58.686
trying to hear one side
of that Redd Foxx album.

01:58.719 --> 02:01.555
Now I was risking my life
trying to hear the other side.

02:08.796 --> 02:11.499
Now, I know it was wrong
to sneak behind my parents back

02:11.532 --> 02:12.566
and listen to dirty records,

02:12.600 --> 02:14.535
but if listening to dirty
records was wrong,

02:14.568 --> 02:15.703
I don't wanna do right.

02:15.736 --> 02:17.805
REDD FOXX:
When I was a kid,
during the depression...

02:17.838 --> 02:20.274
I mean we were poor.

02:20.308 --> 02:23.177
When Christmas time came,
if I hadn't been a boy

02:23.211 --> 02:25.446
I wouldn't have had nothing
to play with.

02:26.714 --> 02:28.516
I found out one thing in life,

02:28.549 --> 02:30.851
if you want people to laugh,
tell 'em a joke.

02:30.884 --> 02:32.586
Now, if you want them
to really laugh,

02:32.620 --> 02:33.921
tell 'em a dirty joke.

02:33.954 --> 02:36.624
Okay, and there was
one black sheep,

02:36.657 --> 02:37.691
and the chief said,

02:37.725 --> 02:40.628
"Okay, you don't tell on
me, I won't tell on you."

02:42.663 --> 02:46.434
All right, stop it, man, come
on, I can't take another one.

02:46.467 --> 02:48.302
No, no, no, no, wait,
I've got one more.

02:48.336 --> 02:49.503
Hold on.
No, no.

02:49.537 --> 02:50.671
I can't take it.

02:50.704 --> 02:51.439
Who is that?

02:51.472 --> 02:53.907
Redd Foxx.
From Sanford and Son?

02:53.941 --> 02:55.309
He's a comedian?

02:55.343 --> 02:56.477
Yeah, you big dummy!

02:56.510 --> 02:57.445
Yeah, I didn't know it either.

02:57.478 --> 02:58.679
My parents have like a bunch
of his albums.

02:58.712 --> 03:00.348
And they let you
listen to that?

03:00.381 --> 03:01.549
Not really.

03:01.582 --> 03:02.650
Still won't!

03:02.683 --> 03:03.551
JOEY:
Hey, Buckwheat.

03:03.584 --> 03:05.986
Alfalfa. What's so funny?

03:06.019 --> 03:07.821
Uh, I was just telling
a stupid joke.

03:07.855 --> 03:08.922
Tell me.

03:08.956 --> 03:10.991
Nah, you wouldn't
really like it.

03:11.024 --> 03:13.527
Yeah, you won't like me smashing
your face in a locker.

03:13.561 --> 03:14.695
Now, tell me the joke.

03:14.728 --> 03:16.530
It's funny. Tell him.

03:16.564 --> 03:18.532
Okay.

03:18.566 --> 03:20.601
There's a missionary who went
to an African village...

03:20.634 --> 03:22.870
If you can make your worst
enemy laugh with a joke,

03:22.903 --> 03:24.472
that's a funny joke.

03:24.505 --> 03:25.939
...and there was
one black sheep.

03:25.973 --> 03:27.341
And the chief said,

03:27.375 --> 03:28.609
"Okay, you don't tell on me,

03:28.642 --> 03:30.611
I won't tell on you."

03:30.644 --> 03:32.480
:
That's real funny, Flip.

03:32.513 --> 03:33.581
Hey, guys,

03:33.614 --> 03:34.948
For the first time,
come here.

03:34.982 --> 03:36.784
I realized a good joke can stop

03:36.817 --> 03:38.286
a beat down.

03:38.319 --> 03:39.720
Too bad Reginald Denny
didn't know any jokes.

03:39.753 --> 03:41.289
All right,
so there's a missionary

03:41.322 --> 03:42.623
who lived in
an African village...

03:44.658 --> 03:46.594
Momma, what you
doing in here?

03:46.627 --> 03:48.662
I thought you might
need a hand with dinner.

03:48.696 --> 03:50.631
Since my grandfather
passed away

03:50.664 --> 03:53.567
my grandmother had a lot
of free time on her hands,

03:53.601 --> 03:55.469
and she was giving it
to my mother.

03:56.570 --> 03:58.672
Baby, that's not
the way to do that.

03:58.706 --> 04:00.641
But I do it this way
all the time.

04:00.674 --> 04:02.643
Yeah, but the way
you do it is wrong.

04:02.676 --> 04:04.545
Go ahead sit down,
I'll do it.

04:04.578 --> 04:06.380
Go ahead, I'll do it.

04:06.414 --> 04:07.915
The only thing
my mother hated worse

04:07.948 --> 04:10.951
than no help
was help from my grandmother.

04:11.985 --> 04:13.754
Okay.

04:13.787 --> 04:15.956
Dinner is served.

04:17.358 --> 04:19.693
Ooh, um...

04:19.727 --> 04:21.462
I can't eat this.

04:21.495 --> 04:22.730
My gout will flair up.

04:22.763 --> 04:24.598
Oh, don't worry.

04:24.632 --> 04:26.700
That's oven-fried chicken.

04:26.734 --> 04:28.636
I used skim milk
in your macaroni,

04:28.669 --> 04:30.604
that's a baked
potato and salad.

04:30.638 --> 04:32.406
So, you go ahead, eat up,
you'll be just fine.

04:32.440 --> 04:35.343
Wow, Momma never did
all that stuff.

04:35.376 --> 04:35.909
Shh!

04:35.943 --> 04:38.712
Where's Momma anyway?

04:39.847 --> 04:40.814
Hey, baby,

04:40.848 --> 04:43.016
you wanna sit down and
have something to eat?

04:43.050 --> 04:44.017
Mm, I'm fine.

04:44.051 --> 04:45.819
Grandma made oven-fried chicken.

04:45.853 --> 04:47.020
Oh, really?

04:47.054 --> 04:48.756
That's nice.

04:48.789 --> 04:50.724
Well, I'm gonna finish
the laundry.

04:50.758 --> 04:51.692
It's finished.

04:51.725 --> 04:52.760
Then I'll go
straighten up

04:52.793 --> 04:53.461
the kids' room.

04:53.494 --> 04:54.094
Oh, they're
straightened.

04:54.127 --> 04:55.529
Uh-oh.

04:55.563 --> 04:57.398
Then I guess I'll go do my toes.

04:57.431 --> 04:59.032
They're done.

05:01.402 --> 05:02.803
ROCHELLE:
When did you do my toes?

05:02.836 --> 05:04.438
MAXINE:
While you were asleep.

05:04.472 --> 05:06.006
I didn't want to wake you.

05:06.039 --> 05:07.641
That look means,

05:07.675 --> 05:09.477
"If you do something else,
you're finished."

05:09.510 --> 05:12.580
Here comes your
girlfriend, Drew.

05:13.747 --> 05:14.815
Girlfriend?

05:14.848 --> 05:15.949
I don't like her.

05:15.983 --> 05:17.217
Well, she likes you.

05:17.250 --> 05:20.454
And she's going around telling
everybody that you kissed her.

05:20.488 --> 05:21.889
Wait, Tonya...

05:21.922 --> 05:23.724
Just about every girl
in the neighborhood liked Drew,

05:23.757 --> 05:27.761
and Chantal was just about
the only girl Drew didn't like.

05:27.795 --> 05:28.996
Hey, Drew.

05:29.029 --> 05:29.863
What you doing?
Uh, nothing.

05:29.897 --> 05:31.932
I was just about to go
back in the house.

05:31.965 --> 05:34.034
Oh... you coming
back out?

05:34.067 --> 05:36.003
Ah, I don't think so.

05:36.036 --> 05:38.005
Oh, you gonna be out
tomorrow after school?

05:38.038 --> 05:40.107
I don't know.
I may have to stay in.

05:40.140 --> 05:41.375
Oh.

05:41.409 --> 05:43.110
Well, maybe I'll
see you later.

05:43.143 --> 05:45.078
Yeah, maybe.

05:48.516 --> 05:50.651
While Drew was trying
to make a clean break,

05:50.684 --> 05:53.120
I was getting down and dirty
with my new jokes.

05:53.153 --> 05:56.056
I told the one about the guy
who got bitten by the snake...

05:56.089 --> 05:57.491
So the doctor said make two cuts

05:57.525 --> 05:59.126
where your friend was bitten
by the snake

05:59.159 --> 05:59.960
and suck out the poison out.

05:59.993 --> 06:02.062
So the guy gets back
to his friend,

06:02.095 --> 06:03.997
the friend said,
"Well, what did the doctor say?"

06:04.031 --> 06:05.999
"You're gonna die."

06:07.568 --> 06:10.103
I told one about the two guys
on the bridge...

06:10.137 --> 06:14.007
And so then the white guy said,
"Man, this water is cold."

06:14.041 --> 06:17.010
And the black guy said,
"Yeah, and it's deep, too."

06:18.345 --> 06:21.882
And I told the one about how
to become an honorary Eskimo.

06:21.915 --> 06:24.117
So, he was bleeding, and
his clothes were torn.

06:24.151 --> 06:25.653
So he walks in and says,

06:25.686 --> 06:28.121
"Now, where's the Eskimo woman
I'm supposed to kill?"

06:31.058 --> 06:32.693
:
Aw...

06:32.726 --> 06:34.161
Hey, little dude
from across the street, man,

06:34.194 --> 06:36.063
you're momma know you here
telling jokes like that?

06:36.096 --> 06:37.798
Nah.
Because if she did,

06:37.831 --> 06:39.032
she'd smack the smut out of me.

06:39.066 --> 06:41.034
Hey, hold up.

06:41.068 --> 06:42.002
Let me hold a dollar.

06:42.035 --> 06:45.172
You want one?
Yeah.

06:49.743 --> 06:51.512
For years I had tried
to be cool,

06:51.545 --> 06:54.414
but I had never felt cooler
than when I tried to be funny.

06:57.485 --> 06:59.753
CHRIS ROCK:
While I kept the guys rolling
with laughter,

06:59.787 --> 07:02.490
my mother kept my father
from rolling into bed.

07:02.523 --> 07:03.691
What are you doing up?

07:03.724 --> 07:05.025
I can't sleep.

07:05.058 --> 07:07.027
Translation: "He can't sleep."

07:08.228 --> 07:09.997
I didn't do something,
did I?

07:10.030 --> 07:12.633
No, it's my mother.

07:12.666 --> 07:14.502
She's driving me crazy.

07:14.535 --> 07:16.470
Every time
I want to do something,

07:16.504 --> 07:17.838
either she's already done it

07:17.871 --> 07:19.707
or she doesn't like
the way I did it.

07:19.740 --> 07:22.075
Baby, she's just
trying to help.

07:22.109 --> 07:24.545
If you call her making me want
to knock her out "help,"

07:24.578 --> 07:25.746
she's doing fine.

07:25.779 --> 07:26.980
I mean,

07:27.014 --> 07:28.115
she's got a house.

07:28.148 --> 07:30.551
Why can't she go over there and
clean up after Michael?

07:30.584 --> 07:33.186
Because if she has to pick up
another one of his socks

07:33.220 --> 07:35.222
she's gonna strangle
him with it.
What?

07:35.255 --> 07:36.123
We were talking earlier.

07:36.156 --> 07:38.225
Rochelle, she's lonely.

07:38.258 --> 07:39.760
She told you that?

07:39.793 --> 07:42.062
No, but it's obvious
she misses your father.

07:42.095 --> 07:44.264
I think she's just trying
to keep herself busy.

07:44.297 --> 07:46.700
Well, I wish she would find
something else to do.

07:46.734 --> 07:49.102
Maybe she should go on a date.

07:49.136 --> 07:50.137
A date?

07:50.170 --> 07:51.939
My mother is almost 60.

07:51.972 --> 07:54.207
How would she look out there
trying to get a date?

07:54.241 --> 07:56.143
Like Bea Arthur
on The Golden Girls.

07:56.176 --> 07:58.111
Better than
she looks downstairs

07:58.145 --> 07:59.813
trying to cook
your dinner.

07:59.847 --> 08:02.249
Back at school,I learned
another valuable lesson.

08:02.282 --> 08:04.017
You could be funny
at the wrong time...

08:04.051 --> 08:05.586
And then the guy said,
"All right, fine.

08:05.619 --> 08:07.154
"Just as long as
you don't hit me

08:07.187 --> 08:08.956
in the back of the head
with that stick."

08:08.989 --> 08:10.123
What's going on
back there?

08:10.157 --> 08:12.225
Nothing.
Oh, really.

08:12.259 --> 08:15.829
So the whole class is giggling
up a storm over nothing at all?

08:16.997 --> 08:18.131
Caruso...

08:18.165 --> 08:19.232
It wasn't me.

08:19.266 --> 08:20.768
He's the one shucking
and jiving.

08:20.801 --> 08:23.604
I guess he's never going
to be in the mob.

08:23.637 --> 08:24.872
So, Mr. Funny Man,

08:24.905 --> 08:27.240
you're so funny,
why don't you make me laugh?

08:27.274 --> 08:28.576
I can't.

08:28.609 --> 08:29.977
Obviously you can.

08:30.010 --> 08:31.579
Everybody else is laughing.

08:31.612 --> 08:34.748
You told them a joke,
so you can tell me a joke?

08:34.782 --> 08:36.283
I don't think so.

08:36.316 --> 08:39.152
Oh, so now you're thinking?

08:39.186 --> 08:40.621
Well, I tell you what.

08:40.654 --> 08:42.189
You'll have plenty
of time to think

08:42.222 --> 08:44.024
when you're serving a day
in detention.

08:45.292 --> 08:47.728
Don't ask me
what I'm thinking right now.

08:47.761 --> 08:51.164
Since my grandmother was too
old to go out looking for men,

08:51.198 --> 08:53.734
my mother decided
to bring the men to her.

08:53.767 --> 08:55.803
Oh, hey, Mrs. Rochelle,
what can I do for you?

08:55.836 --> 08:56.937
Hey, Mr. Omar.

08:56.970 --> 08:58.972
Do you remember my mother,
Maxine?

08:59.006 --> 09:00.173
Yes.

09:00.207 --> 09:02.242
Husband died telling
a knock-knock joke.

09:02.275 --> 09:04.678
Tragic. Tragic.

09:04.712 --> 09:06.680
I was wondering
if you might know

09:06.714 --> 09:08.582
of any available men
around her age?

09:08.616 --> 09:09.717
Uh-oh,

09:09.750 --> 09:12.820
momma's got a brand
new bag, huh?

09:12.853 --> 09:14.688
Yeah, I think I might know
a few people.

09:14.722 --> 09:15.956
Come on in.
Okay, thanks.

09:15.989 --> 09:17.791
So, uh,
how is Mr. Julius?

09:17.825 --> 09:19.126
He's fine.

09:19.159 --> 09:20.160
Oh.

09:20.193 --> 09:24.264
Some guys want their sisters
to hook 'em up.

09:24.297 --> 09:25.799
Not Drew.

09:25.833 --> 09:26.900
Chantal called you.

09:26.934 --> 09:28.001
What?

09:28.035 --> 09:29.136
How'd she get our number?

09:29.169 --> 09:30.337
I gave it to her.

09:30.370 --> 09:31.739
What'd you do that for?

09:31.772 --> 09:33.273
Because she likes you.

09:33.306 --> 09:35.008
So? I don't like her.

09:35.042 --> 09:36.076
So?

09:36.109 --> 09:37.177
What do you mean "so"?

09:37.210 --> 09:38.345
I mean "so."

09:38.378 --> 09:40.247
Just because you don't like her

09:40.280 --> 09:41.581
doesn't mean she
don't like you.

09:41.615 --> 09:44.852
Drew hadn't learned that women
spoke a different language...

09:44.885 --> 09:46.219
Crazy.

09:46.253 --> 09:47.988
Meanwhile,
my mother was looking

09:48.021 --> 09:49.923
for a man to get back
her sanity.

09:49.957 --> 09:51.224
I have a question for you.

09:51.258 --> 09:52.926
Of course.

09:52.960 --> 09:57.965
Does your mom have a cellar,
a large freezer and a pension?

09:59.366 --> 10:01.869
Have you ever dated
a black woman before?

10:01.902 --> 10:03.303
Oh, yeah.

10:03.336 --> 10:06.273
There's nothing I love better
than a bad mamajama.

10:06.306 --> 10:08.642
I hope you're talking
about the song.

10:10.310 --> 10:12.713
Did Mr. Omar send you?

10:12.746 --> 10:15.348
No, your window was open.

10:17.918 --> 10:18.952
Can you hold this gun?

10:21.722 --> 10:22.956
Michael,
what are you doing here?

10:22.990 --> 10:24.257
Stopping a home wrecker.

10:24.291 --> 10:26.193
You trying
to break me and Momma up.

10:26.226 --> 10:27.360
It's time for her
to come home.

10:27.394 --> 10:29.396
I'm hungry.

10:32.700 --> 10:34.067
Hey.

10:34.101 --> 10:35.335
Hey, Mr. Omar.

10:35.368 --> 10:37.037
Yeah, so how did
the fellas work out?

10:37.070 --> 10:38.371
They didn't.

10:38.405 --> 10:39.372
Who's this?

10:39.406 --> 10:40.607
I'm Lester.

10:40.640 --> 10:43.944
You know, you're much younger
than I thought you would be.

10:43.977 --> 10:44.978
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

10:45.012 --> 10:47.180
Slow down, lowdown.

10:47.214 --> 10:48.281
You're not coming to meet me.

10:48.315 --> 10:50.017
You're coming
to meet my mother.

10:50.050 --> 10:52.853
:
Well, if she looks
anything like you,

10:52.886 --> 10:54.454
this could work out.

10:54.487 --> 10:57.324
Calm down, Billy Dee,
she don't want your Colt 45.

10:57.357 --> 10:58.325
Well, if you talk

10:58.358 --> 11:00.828
to her like you talking to me...

11:00.861 --> 11:02.095
:
it just might.

11:11.171 --> 11:12.272
Where you been?

11:12.305 --> 11:15.142
I'm sorry I'm late.
I was in detention.
Detention?

11:15.175 --> 11:16.076
For what?

11:16.109 --> 11:18.111
I was telling
Redd Foxx jokes in class.

11:18.145 --> 11:19.980
Redd Foxx?

11:20.013 --> 11:21.414
As dirty as he is,

11:21.448 --> 11:23.383
I know your mother
didn't let you listen to that.

11:23.416 --> 11:26.253
Nope. I snuck and listened to it
while they were asleep.

11:26.286 --> 11:29.189
Oh, you got a little sneak
in you, huh?

11:29.222 --> 11:30.257
Yeah, I guess.

11:30.290 --> 11:33.393
You know, I used to write
jokes for some comedians

11:33.426 --> 11:34.394
back when.

11:34.427 --> 11:36.830
You did?
Mm-hmm.

11:38.131 --> 11:40.801
I got a joke or two on most
of these albums here.

11:40.834 --> 11:41.601
Really?

11:41.634 --> 11:43.503
Well, can I listen to them?
Sure.

11:43.536 --> 11:46.439
But some of this material
is a little blue.

11:46.473 --> 11:48.175
Blue?

11:48.208 --> 11:49.276
Yeah, filthy.

11:49.309 --> 11:52.412
So if you hear something
you ain't supposed to hear,

11:52.445 --> 11:53.480
turn it off.

11:53.513 --> 11:55.415
Don't be so strict, old man.

11:55.448 --> 11:56.750
I'm gonna make a slopper.

11:56.784 --> 11:57.785
You want one?

11:57.818 --> 12:00.020
Nah, I'm all right.

12:02.089 --> 12:04.758
"Moms Mabley?

12:04.792 --> 12:09.029
"Bill Cosby.

12:09.062 --> 12:12.065
George CarlinClass Clown"

12:15.035 --> 12:18.038
CARLIN:
Yeah, there are 400,000 words
in the English language,

12:18.071 --> 12:20.808
and there are seven of them
you can't say on television.

12:20.841 --> 12:22.910
:
They must really be bad...

12:22.943 --> 12:25.278
"Seven Words You Can
Never Say On Television"?

12:25.312 --> 12:26.513
You know the seven, don't you,

12:26.546 --> 12:27.414
that you can't say
on television?

12:27.447 --> 12:29.783
Seven? I could
only think of three.

12:29.817 --> 12:31.418
What? Whoo!

12:31.451 --> 12:32.853
Ouch! Uh-huh!

12:32.886 --> 12:34.387
Whoa! Hey, now!

12:34.421 --> 12:36.423
Ho, ho, ho, ho!

12:36.456 --> 12:38.391
My vocabulary
just grew by four.

12:40.861 --> 12:42.029
Dirty jokes were one thing.

12:42.062 --> 12:44.197
Dirty words were
a whole new ballgame.

12:44.231 --> 12:45.933
Oh, my God.

12:45.966 --> 12:47.100
Where'd you hear that?

12:47.134 --> 12:48.268
George Carlin.

12:48.301 --> 12:50.037
That's comedy?

12:50.070 --> 12:51.238
I think it's funny.

12:51.271 --> 12:52.873
Well, I hate cursing.

12:52.906 --> 12:55.508
My father used to call my mother
number four all the time.

12:55.542 --> 12:56.977
Then she'd call him number five.

12:57.010 --> 12:58.846
And they'd go back
and forth like that.

12:58.879 --> 13:01.148
Five, four, two, one.

13:01.181 --> 13:02.349
Seven.

13:02.382 --> 13:03.550
Then they'd end up
on number three.

13:03.583 --> 13:06.153
Greg was an early adapter
of "too much information."

13:06.186 --> 13:07.587
Well, I don't want
to get in trouble,

13:07.620 --> 13:09.489
so don't tell anybody.

13:09.522 --> 13:11.124
It never occurred to me
that Greg wasn't

13:11.158 --> 13:12.993
the one I had to worry about.

13:14.895 --> 13:16.196
Don't tell anybody.

13:16.229 --> 13:17.464
Don't tell anybody.

13:17.497 --> 13:19.566
I liked it better
when you worked clean, man.

13:19.599 --> 13:22.402
You know, I feel that the use
of foul language degrades

13:22.435 --> 13:25.839
not only the listener
but the speaker as well.

13:25.873 --> 13:27.474
Caruso is the only guy I know

13:27.507 --> 13:30.577
who would beat things
out of you he wouldn't say.

13:30.610 --> 13:32.579
Just because my mother
found a man

13:32.612 --> 13:34.381
didn't mean my grandmother
wanted one.

13:34.414 --> 13:36.516
Rochelle, you know
I hate surprises.

13:36.549 --> 13:38.218
Momma, I think
you might like this one.

13:38.251 --> 13:39.586
Okay.

13:39.619 --> 13:41.188
What?

13:41.221 --> 13:43.891
Ta-dah!

13:43.924 --> 13:45.558
Momma, this
is Lester.

13:45.592 --> 13:47.861
Lester, this is
my mother Maxine.

13:47.895 --> 13:49.262
It's a pleasure to meet you.

13:49.296 --> 13:51.231
What is this?

13:51.264 --> 13:52.432
Mom, it's just dinner.

13:52.465 --> 13:54.501
I just thought you might
like to have a meal

13:54.534 --> 13:56.603
with somebody
besides us for a change.

13:56.636 --> 13:58.305
So, what, you just go out on
the street, get some man,

13:58.338 --> 13:59.439
bring him up here
to eat with me

13:59.472 --> 14:00.440
like I'm a
charity case?

14:00.473 --> 14:01.975
No, Momma, I didn't say that.

14:02.009 --> 14:05.012
Maxine, it's just
a friendly meal.

14:05.045 --> 14:06.413
That's what Robert Blake said.

14:06.446 --> 14:08.148
We are not friends.
I don't know you.

14:08.181 --> 14:09.516
And you sure don't know me.

14:09.549 --> 14:12.452
Well, I was thinking we
could get to know each other.

14:12.485 --> 14:13.954
Anybody ask you
what you think?

14:13.987 --> 14:14.587
ROCHELLE:
Momma!

14:14.621 --> 14:15.588
Don't "Momma" me.

14:15.622 --> 14:17.157
I'm too old
for a blind date.

14:17.190 --> 14:19.359
Wouldn't say that
if it was Stevie Wonder.

14:19.392 --> 14:20.593
I don't know who
you're eating with,

14:20.627 --> 14:24.397
but you're not going
to eat with me.

14:24.431 --> 14:25.665
Momma...

14:25.698 --> 14:28.368
Just have a couple
of peas or something.

14:29.402 --> 14:31.438
Sorry?

14:31.471 --> 14:32.305
What about you?

14:32.339 --> 14:33.606
Would you care to eat?

14:33.640 --> 14:34.942
What?

14:34.975 --> 14:36.576
I came to eat.

14:36.609 --> 14:38.545
I don't care who I eat with.

14:40.580 --> 14:43.183
Might as well.

14:43.216 --> 14:45.919
My brother never asked me
for advice about girls

14:45.953 --> 14:47.587
and there was a good reason.

14:49.689 --> 14:51.091
What's wrong?

14:51.124 --> 14:52.692
Well, there's this girl.

14:52.725 --> 14:53.493
What about her?

14:53.526 --> 14:55.262
You know when
a girl likes you,

14:55.295 --> 14:56.629
but you just don't
like her back?

14:56.663 --> 14:58.932
Is he serious?
No, I don't.

14:58.966 --> 15:01.034
Well, how do you tell her
without hurting her feelings?

15:01.068 --> 15:02.035
I have no idea.

15:02.069 --> 15:03.937
I should probably just
tell her the truth, huh?

15:03.971 --> 15:04.938
I don't know.

15:04.972 --> 15:06.974
I should probably
tell her.

15:07.007 --> 15:09.009
Okay.

15:09.042 --> 15:10.978
Thanks.
Welcome.

15:11.011 --> 15:14.314
Why can't everything
be this easy?

15:20.153 --> 15:24.057
Ma, I can't believe you
treated that man like that.

15:24.091 --> 15:27.027
I can't believe you
treated me like a floozy

15:27.060 --> 15:30.497
looking to pick up some
strange man off the street.

15:30.530 --> 15:32.199
Well, Ma, ever
since Daddy died,

15:32.232 --> 15:34.101
I just worry about
you being lonely.

15:34.134 --> 15:35.568
I am not lonely.

15:35.602 --> 15:38.305
I love coming here, taking care
of you and your kids.

15:38.338 --> 15:41.975
But you're
driving me crazy.

15:42.009 --> 15:43.743
Ma, this
is my house.

15:43.776 --> 15:46.279
I like to do things my way.

15:46.313 --> 15:48.515
This family already
has one momma.

15:48.548 --> 15:49.516
We don't need two.

15:49.549 --> 15:52.052
Okay.

15:52.085 --> 15:54.121
I'll go.

15:54.154 --> 15:56.423
But Ma, I didn't
mean it like that.
Uh-uh, no, no.

16:01.694 --> 16:03.063
Hey, Chantal.

16:03.096 --> 16:05.465
Can I ask you a question?

16:05.498 --> 16:07.734
Yeah.
How come you don't like me?

16:07.767 --> 16:09.469
I don't know.

16:09.502 --> 16:10.703
I just don't.

16:10.737 --> 16:12.539
It's got to be something.

16:12.572 --> 16:13.773
Do you think I'm ugly?

16:13.806 --> 16:15.508
No.

16:15.542 --> 16:17.077
Do you think
I'm dumb?

16:17.110 --> 16:18.078
No.

16:18.111 --> 16:19.179
Then what is it?

16:19.212 --> 16:20.380
Just tell me the truth.

16:25.185 --> 16:26.786
You're too tall.

16:26.819 --> 16:28.455
Never stopped Danny DeVito.

16:32.725 --> 16:34.494
Hello.

16:34.527 --> 16:36.163
Are you stalking me?

16:36.196 --> 16:37.597
:
No.

16:37.630 --> 16:41.768
I just dropped by Mr. Omar's
for a moment to say hello.

16:41.801 --> 16:44.037
:
Oh, I'm sorry.

16:44.071 --> 16:45.138
Um...

16:45.172 --> 16:49.142
I'm sorry about what
happened last night.

16:49.176 --> 16:53.580
I didn't know that you had
no idea I was coming.

16:53.613 --> 16:56.283
My daughter did
the same thing to me.

16:56.316 --> 16:58.151
Where do they get
off doing that?

16:58.185 --> 17:01.588
If I wanted to meet
someone, I would.

17:01.621 --> 17:03.290
I-I... I know.

17:03.323 --> 17:05.592
My daughter had
so many women coming through

17:05.625 --> 17:07.694
it was like
a Miss America Pageant.

17:09.162 --> 17:11.298
She thinks
she's protecting me.

17:11.331 --> 17:12.299
I just wish

17:12.332 --> 17:13.800
she would get out of my house.

17:15.335 --> 17:17.837
The only way I can get
my son out of the house

17:17.870 --> 17:19.806
is to put dinner on the stoop.

17:21.841 --> 17:23.776
I'm so sorry
I was rude.

17:23.810 --> 17:25.812
I was just caught off guard.

17:25.845 --> 17:27.714
Ah, don't worry
about it.

17:27.747 --> 17:30.350
It was just nice to meet you.

17:30.383 --> 17:33.153
Well, very nice
meeting you, too.

17:33.186 --> 17:35.088
Uh, Maxine.

17:35.122 --> 17:38.358
Would you mind if we had
a cup of coffee sometime?

17:38.391 --> 17:39.859
Coffee?

17:39.892 --> 17:41.494
I guess.

17:41.528 --> 17:42.562
How about now?

17:42.595 --> 17:46.133
Oh, well, that
would be nice.

17:48.701 --> 17:50.637
Don't try
anything funny.

17:50.670 --> 17:54.341
I have mace and a whistle
in my purse.

17:54.374 --> 17:55.875
He's got a gun.

17:55.908 --> 17:58.478
Do you know what
you've started?

17:58.511 --> 17:59.346
What?

17:59.379 --> 18:01.148
Every kid in this
school is swearing

18:01.181 --> 18:02.349
like a drunken sailor.

18:02.382 --> 18:03.183
It's out of control.

18:03.216 --> 18:04.684
Well, I told them
not to tell anybody.

18:04.717 --> 18:05.652
You told everybody.

18:05.685 --> 18:08.121
It's not like I said it
in class or anything.

18:08.155 --> 18:10.490
Didn't mean
somebody else didn't.

18:10.523 --> 18:12.492
Young man...

18:13.526 --> 18:16.196
I want a word with you.

18:16.229 --> 18:18.665
In fact, I want
seven words with you.

18:18.698 --> 18:21.201
Number one had hit the fan.

18:21.234 --> 18:22.835
Suspended?

18:22.869 --> 18:24.337
For talking in class?

18:24.371 --> 18:25.872
What did you say?

18:25.905 --> 18:26.939
Well, it's a routine called

18:26.973 --> 18:29.376
"The Seven Words You Can
Never Say On Television."

18:29.409 --> 18:31.444
Well, what are they?
I can't say them.

18:31.478 --> 18:32.679
We're on television, woman!

18:32.712 --> 18:34.347
Didn't you hear
the name of the bit?

18:34.381 --> 18:35.648
Boy, what are these words?

18:35.682 --> 18:37.150
Write them down.

18:37.184 --> 18:39.752
When I was writing
these words down,

18:39.786 --> 18:42.389
I realized they were
more silly than dirty.

18:45.392 --> 18:47.227
You said this?!

18:47.260 --> 18:49.662
Look at this.

18:49.696 --> 18:50.930
I never even say this.

18:50.963 --> 18:53.166
Why would you
say this?!

18:53.200 --> 18:54.534
I was trying to be funny.

18:54.567 --> 18:57.837
Oh, you're gonna feel
mighty funny when I beat the...

18:57.870 --> 18:59.839
number one out of you.

18:59.872 --> 19:02.175
Look, they're the seven words
you can't say on TV.

19:02.209 --> 19:03.376
Where does it say
you can say 'em

19:03.410 --> 19:04.911
in school?
And why would you think

19:04.944 --> 19:06.779
that something like this
is funny anyway?

19:06.813 --> 19:09.182
It's no worse than Redd Foxx.

19:09.216 --> 19:11.218
Where did you hear Redd Foxx?
Here.

19:11.251 --> 19:12.452
What do you mean "here"?

19:12.485 --> 19:13.686
A few nights ago,

19:13.720 --> 19:16.423
y'all were playing the records
and I heard it.

19:16.456 --> 19:18.825
Some parents would blame
themselves-- not mine.

19:18.858 --> 19:19.959
Who is this anyway?

19:19.992 --> 19:21.328
George Carlin.

19:21.361 --> 19:22.829
George Carlin from Car Wash?

19:22.862 --> 19:23.863
Yeah.

19:23.896 --> 19:26.233
No wonder his part
in that movie was so small.

19:26.266 --> 19:28.501
If he'd have said anything else,
they wouldn't have been able

19:28.535 --> 19:30.270
to put it out.

19:30.303 --> 19:31.271
I'm sorry.

19:31.304 --> 19:32.672
Mm-mm-mm.
Chris,

19:32.705 --> 19:34.574
if you're interested in comedy,
that's fine,

19:34.607 --> 19:36.443
but some things are
not appropriate for your age.

19:36.476 --> 19:37.877
Just because we listen
to Redd Foxx

19:37.910 --> 19:39.045
don't mean you're supposed to.

19:39.078 --> 19:41.581
There's a reason why we
waited for you to go upstairs

19:41.614 --> 19:43.250
and fall asleep.

19:43.283 --> 19:45.285
You can't understand
comedy like this.

19:45.318 --> 19:46.786
I understood it.

19:46.819 --> 19:48.621
You understood which one?

19:48.655 --> 19:49.856
All of them.

19:49.889 --> 19:52.325
The one about the lady
with the funny lips?

19:52.359 --> 19:53.326
Yeah.

19:53.360 --> 19:54.794
The one about making sandwiches?

19:54.827 --> 19:55.795
Yeah.

19:55.828 --> 19:57.364
The one about
the black sheep?

19:57.397 --> 19:58.365
Yeah.

19:58.398 --> 19:59.799
The one about the Fukawi Indian?

19:59.832 --> 20:00.667
:
Yeah.

20:00.700 --> 20:02.369
Boy, where did you
learn all of this?

20:02.402 --> 20:03.936
I don't know;
I just picked it up.

20:03.970 --> 20:08.241
Chris, look, the point is:
this is not comedy for children.

20:08.275 --> 20:10.810
Next time I find out you're
telling these type of jokes,

20:10.843 --> 20:12.479
you're gonna get
more than suspended.

20:12.512 --> 20:13.946
You done?

20:13.980 --> 20:15.382
Yeah, why?

20:15.415 --> 20:17.450
'Cause as far as
I'm concerned,

20:17.484 --> 20:19.852
this time is
next time.

20:19.886 --> 20:23.556
Number three...!
