- Decreased breath sounds on his left side.

10:21.073 --> 10:23.132
Maybe one of you should call.
Is-is that uh,

10:23.142 --> 10:25.234
better or worse, hearing from a doctor?

10:25.244 --> 10:27.603
- Uh, better or worse? Okay.
- Taylor, you need to calm down.

10:27.613 --> 10:29.615
Looking for internal injuries.

10:31.693 --> 10:34.198
- Whose suit is that?
- TAYLOR: I was playing a night round.

10:34.209 --> 10:36.078
- IRVING: Yeah.
- I should've stuck to the day.

10:36.088 --> 10:37.780
It's just a bad call by me.

10:37.790 --> 10:40.650
It's just, I was so busy, that I...
you know, and I-I can't think.

10:40.660 --> 10:43.089
I'm so sorry, I-I didn't mean
to... I hit you, I...

10:43.100 --> 10:45.755
- How do you even play at night?
- Oh, glow-in-the-dark balls.

10:45.765 --> 10:47.504
- It's pretty awesome. Yeah.
- IRVING: Oh, cool.

10:47.515 --> 10:48.848
Why were you there?

10:48.859 --> 10:50.325
His intestines are in his chest.

10:50.335 --> 10:51.661

10:51.671 --> 10:53.354
I'll prep the OR.

10:57.809 --> 11:00.857
You're bleeding. You could have
a significant head injury.

11:00.868 --> 11:02.171
I need to check you out.

11:02.212 --> 11:04.480
What on earth happened last night?

11:05.843 --> 11:07.711
I don't remember.

11:10.555 --> 11:12.892
DEVON: Okay, here we go.
Follow my finger.

11:15.611 --> 11:17.146
Nice.

11:18.230 --> 11:20.700
All right, clench your jaw
and hold still.

11:21.901 --> 11:23.793
Puff out your cheeks.

11:23.803 --> 11:25.695

11:28.173 --> 11:30.575
I'm gonna take a look
at that head wound.

11:32.144 --> 11:34.737
Okay. What's the last thing
you remember?

11:34.747 --> 11:36.171
Drinking with the Raptor.

11:36.181 --> 11:38.040
I ordered another round of drinks,

11:38.050 --> 11:39.675
and he had to go leave

11:39.685 --> 11:41.811
to be with his
brilliant one-night stand.

11:41.821 --> 11:44.246
Ah, so you drank
that last round by yourself?

11:44.256 --> 11:45.647
No. Someone else joined me.

11:45.657 --> 11:48.350
I just... don't remember who.

11:48.360 --> 11:49.833
Maybe the guy from the golf course?

11:49.844 --> 11:52.221
- Definitely not him.
- So, we have heavy drinking

11:52.231 --> 11:53.588
with a mystery person

11:53.598 --> 11:55.590
and a late-night stroll
on a golf course.

11:55.600 --> 11:57.092
None of that sounds like you.

11:57.102 --> 11:58.260
I don't lose control.

11:58.270 --> 11:59.847
I have never behaved this way.

11:59.858 --> 12:02.015
Well, while you figure out
why you went off the rails,

12:02.026 --> 12:03.999
I will figure out
why you have mild amnesia.

12:04.009 --> 12:05.567
I need to rule out a bleed.

12:05.577 --> 12:07.069
I got to keep you for observation.

12:07.079 --> 12:09.772
And that means no reading, no watching

12:09.782 --> 12:11.206
and no thinking.

12:11.216 --> 12:12.908
Are you putting me on brain rest?

12:12.918 --> 12:14.209
DEVON: Yes.

12:14.219 --> 12:16.712
AUSTIN: He knows of which he speaks.

12:16.722 --> 12:19.348

but do what Pravesh tells you.

I'm fine, and I'm scrubbing in.

12:26.298 --> 12:28.868
You cuff her to the bed if need be.

12:30.269 --> 12:33.095
You approach this bed with restraints...

12:33.105 --> 12:35.197
I will end you.

12:35.207 --> 12:37.242
Just relax.

12:56.561 --> 12:58.587
I'm pitching you someone who won big.

12:58.597 --> 13:00.823
- Won what big?
- The lottery, baby.

13:00.833 --> 13:03.068
His name's Taylor Emeye.

13:08.340 --> 13:09.799
Dr. Nolan.

13:09.809 --> 13:12.444
Just... hang on one second.

13:16.281 --> 13:18.607
Mr. Emeye, I'm Dr. Randolph Bell,

13:18.617 --> 13:21.911
Chief of Surgery and CEO
here at Chastain Park Memorial.

13:21.921 --> 13:24.479
Hi, Dr. Bell. Is-is something wrong?

13:24.489 --> 13:26.748
No, no, not at all.
I just wanted to let you know

13:26.758 --> 13:29.284
that I will be scrubbing in with
one of our very top surgeons

13:29.294 --> 13:31.821
on your operation today,
and you'll be recovering

13:31.831 --> 13:33.188
in our VIP wing.

13:33.198 --> 13:36.635
Would you prefer a suite
that favors sunrise or sunset?

13:37.669 --> 13:39.761
Sunrise or sunset?

13:39.771 --> 13:42.965
Sunrise or sunset, sunrise
or sunset, sunrise or sunset,

13:42.975 --> 13:44.800
sunrise or sunset, sunrise or...

13:44.810 --> 13:47.102
You don't have to decide now.

13:47.112 --> 13:49.138
Okay? W-We will see you after.

13:49.148 --> 13:50.705
Okay.

13:50.715 --> 13:52.374
Dr. Bell.

13:52.384 --> 13:54.143
For you to advertise me

13:54.153 --> 13:56.578
as one of the elite surgeons
at this hospital is...

13:56.589 --> 13:58.957
No, I wasn't talking about you.

14:04.796 --> 14:06.388
You got something on your mind?

14:06.398 --> 14:09.124
AUSTIN: As a locum tenens,
these eyes have seen a lot

14:09.134 --> 14:11.160
of CEOs of a lot of hospitals

14:11.170 --> 14:14.029
do a lot of things in the name
of financial solvency.

14:14.039 --> 14:15.831
This going somewhere?

14:15.841 --> 14:17.366
Well, let's start with staff cuts.

14:17.376 --> 14:20.035
You fired Jana Cervantes...
my favorite scrub nurse...

14:20.045 --> 14:22.537
and replaced her
with a less-expensive imposter.

14:22.547 --> 14:24.816
Said nurse is in the room.

14:27.887 --> 14:29.744
And she shouldn't be.

14:29.754 --> 14:31.346
Exactly my point.

14:31.356 --> 14:33.748
But the bright red flag on the field is:

14:33.758 --> 14:36.251
why am I in here with you
when we both know Nolan

14:36.261 --> 14:38.520
could easily handle this cut and run?

14:38.530 --> 14:41.223
Now, I smell wealth screenings.

14:41.233 --> 14:42.824
And if you would stoop to software

14:42.834 --> 14:45.360
to spy on your patients,
then I have to ask:

14:45.370 --> 14:48.030
how much is your boy Taylor worth,

14:48.040 --> 14:50.933
and how deep of a hole is Chastain in?

14:50.943 --> 14:53.335
- BELL: Barking in the dark.
- Well, I know what I see.

14:53.345 --> 14:57.672
- BELL: Well, let me educate you.
- And what I see is confusing.

15:18.103 --> 15:21.188
Even thinking about not thinking
constitutes as thinking.

15:21.199 --> 15:23.602
Hear there was an incident
with a hospital gown.

15:23.613 --> 15:26.750
God. Itchy, tortuous fabric
that will never touch this skin.

15:28.113 --> 15:29.438
Brought you these.

You are a godsend.

15:35.516 --> 15:37.812
- Wait, did you see this?
- No. What is it?

15:41.893 --> 15:44.205
I think you're wearing Bell's suit.

15:44.216 --> 15:46.555
God. I should have
put on the hospital gown.

15:46.565 --> 15:48.924
Okay, so you end up in Bell's suit

15:48.934 --> 15:50.993
at the end of a wild night.

15:51.003 --> 15:53.462
Clearly, you have some things
to get off your chest.

15:53.472 --> 15:55.464
(CHUCKLES) No, you're wrong. I'm fine.

I'm here for you, too.

Why are you doing an echocardiogram?

16:22.767 --> 16:24.858
(SIGHS) She got a unit
of blood with dialysis.

16:24.869 --> 16:26.932
That shouldn't be enough to
tip her into pulmonary edema.

16:26.943 --> 16:28.241
It shouldn't be,

16:28.252 --> 16:31.446
but I'm afraid she has, uh,
a reduced ejection fraction.

16:31.608 --> 16:32.630
- (SIGHS)

16:32.641 --> 16:35.836
Okay, you're freaking me out
with all the medical speak.

16:35.846 --> 16:38.079
Can you just...
can you explain it in English?

16:38.090 --> 16:40.383
Your heart isn't pumping
strongly enough,

16:40.393 --> 16:41.674
so your lungs filled with fluid.

16:41.685 --> 16:43.193
That's what's making it hard to breathe.

16:43.204 --> 16:44.539
Why isn't my heart working?

16:46.733 --> 16:49.736
I'm sorry, Jessie,
but you're in heart failure.

16:51.737 --> 16:53.433
First kidney failure.

16:53.444 --> 16:55.130
Now heart failure.

16:55.140 --> 16:57.132
- What's happening?
- We don't know yet.

16:57.142 --> 16:59.435
But Dr. Williams will do
a full workup. Keep us updated,

16:59.445 --> 17:03.105
and I promise I will translate
everything into English for you.

17:03.115 --> 17:04.607
It's too much, Nic.

17:04.617 --> 17:08.711
We're gonna figure things out, okay?

17:08.721 --> 17:10.145
Just try to stay calm.

17:10.155 --> 17:13.508
My sister needs a kidney
transplant as soon as possible.

17:13.519 --> 17:15.704
We're looking for a match,
but even if we find one,

17:15.714 --> 17:18.119
Jessie's not eligible unless
she's on the recipient list.

17:18.130 --> 17:20.583
If I recall, she isn't listed
because she's an opioid addict.

17:20.594 --> 17:21.882
Was. Was.

17:21.893 --> 17:23.551
She has been two months clean and sober.

17:23.563 --> 17:25.989
Six months of sobriety's
the hard and fast rule.

17:26.000 --> 17:27.458
Right, that is Chastain's policy,

17:27.469 --> 17:29.461
but other hospitals
have different criteria.

17:29.472 --> 17:32.465
You could decrease the amount
of time required.

17:32.744 --> 17:36.459
Or just... make an exception.
Dr. Bell, please.

17:36.470 --> 17:38.140
If I make an exception for Jessie,

17:38.150 --> 17:41.076
I'd have to make an exception for
others. It's a slippery slope.

17:41.086 --> 17:44.185
We both know that addiction
is a disease.

17:44.196 --> 17:45.748
She shouldn't be punished for that.

17:45.758 --> 17:47.249
Well, it isn't a punishment.

17:47.259 --> 17:50.185
Chastain has a responsibility to honor

17:50.195 --> 17:52.622
the donors' sacrifice
by ensuring that each organ

17:52.632 --> 17:55.167
has the greatest chance for success.

17:57.370 --> 18:00.296
You remember the drug trial
that you approved?

18:00.306 --> 18:02.274
That you approved, for money?

18:04.209 --> 18:07.947
That's what caused
Jessie's kidney failure.

18:09.349 --> 18:12.508
She trusted Chastain.

18:12.518 --> 18:14.677
And now she will die

18:14.687 --> 18:16.722
if we don't help her.

18:19.559 --> 18:21.827
Please.

18:23.162 --> 18:25.164
I-I wish I could.

18:34.306 --> 18:36.308
(SNIFFLES)

18:42.601 --> 18:45.007
AUSTIN: Dr. Bell and I were
able to repair your diaphragm

18:45.017 --> 18:46.175
without incident.

18:46.185 --> 18:47.643
But during the procedure,

18:47.653 --> 18:49.311
we noticed your lungs have

18:49.321 --> 18:51.313
- an irregular appearance.
- Irregular?

18:51.323 --> 18:53.248
- What's wrong with me?
- BELL: It's most likely

18:53.258 --> 18:54.817
you have an infection.

18:54.827 --> 18:56.419
But there's a possibility
that you may have

18:56.429 --> 18:58.588
an inflammatory process,
which would then need to be

18:58.598 --> 18:59.755
treated aggressively.

18:59.765 --> 19:02.568
Have you had a cough
or shortness of breath?

19:03.769 --> 19:05.060
Yeah.

19:05.070 --> 19:07.062
Okay, well, have a choice.

19:07.072 --> 19:09.832
We can give you antibiotics and...

19:09.842 --> 19:11.934
if it's an infection,
it should get better.

19:11.944 --> 19:14.904
Or we can perform a bronchoscopy
to get a definitive diagnosis,

19:14.914 --> 19:17.373
so that we can treat you
more specifically sooner.

19:17.383 --> 19:19.675
Which, in this case,
would be my recommendation.

19:19.685 --> 19:21.377
TAYLOR: A bronchoscopy.

19:21.387 --> 19:24.106
- That-that sounds serious.
- It's a minor procedure

19:24.117 --> 19:26.764
where we reach deep into your lungs
and take a little piece of tissue.

19:26.775 --> 19:29.501
Before committing, I need statistics
on most common complications.

19:29.512 --> 19:31.621
Uh, uh, am I put under or sedated?

19:31.631 --> 19:33.355
You'll be under conscious sedation,

19:33.365 --> 19:35.527
which means you'll be awake,
but you won't feel anything.

19:35.538 --> 19:37.729
We take a thin tube, we pass it
through your nostrils

19:37.740 --> 19:39.461
or your mouth, down to your lungs.

19:39.472 --> 19:41.920
Pros and cons on nasal versus
oral would go a long way

19:41.931 --> 19:44.599
in helping me decide. Could I
have a day to think about this?

19:44.610 --> 19:46.368
No, no. This is serious, dawg.

19:46.378 --> 19:48.080
We need to treat this, like, yesterday.

19:49.114 --> 19:51.373
A hasty decision is a careless decision.

19:51.383 --> 19:53.042
BELL: I wish we had more time,

19:53.052 --> 19:55.244
but that would be putting your life

19:55.254 --> 19:57.980
at great risk, and I am
not willing to do that.

19:57.990 --> 19:59.992
I don't think you want that, either.

- And you don't have to.

We will start you on the antibiotics,

20:08.901 --> 20:11.093
and then graduate you
to the bronchoscopy

20:29.021 --> 20:31.080
I see that.

20:31.091 --> 20:32.425
How was your night?

20:35.595 --> 20:37.213
What do you care?

20:38.964 --> 20:41.256
First time at The Depot?

20:41.266 --> 20:43.435
The... what?

20:44.804 --> 20:46.028
You're a member at the, uh,

20:46.038 --> 20:48.030
Crystal Springs Golf Club.

20:48.040 --> 20:50.604
- Spit it out, Mina.
- Tell me where you were last night.

20:50.615 --> 20:52.241
Well, not that it's
any of your business,

20:52.252 --> 20:54.870
I had a date. Did not go as
planned, I went home early.

20:54.881 --> 20:57.183
So where the hell were you?

20:58.518 --> 20:59.619
We're done here.

21:04.792 --> 21:07.782
- You're on brain rest.
- Don't make us call your mother.

21:07.793 --> 21:10.486
- Too soon.
- Fair enough.

21:10.496 --> 21:12.087
We're worried about you.

21:12.665 --> 21:14.018
Mina...

21:14.500 --> 21:16.058
don't run off again.

21:16.068 --> 21:17.570
We're not playing.

21:34.687 --> 21:36.512
Irving.

21:36.522 --> 21:39.414
I want to see Taylor. Now.

21:39.424 --> 21:40.893
No.

21:42.094 --> 21:44.096
I'm not playing.

21:45.998 --> 21:48.323
Hey.

21:48.333 --> 21:50.526
Well, your oxygen levels
and BP have improved.

21:50.536 --> 21:52.528
And it looks like...

21:52.538 --> 21:54.329
they got off two liters with dialysis,

21:54.339 --> 21:57.009
so, all good signs.

21:58.510 --> 22:00.880
Good signs I'm not dying right now.

22:02.514 --> 22:04.173
Look, one day at a time.

22:04.183 --> 22:07.276
(SCOFFS) But how many-how many
days do I have left?

22:07.286 --> 22:10.079
I mean, come on. We both know
I'm running out of time.

22:10.089 --> 22:12.347
If a kidney walked in the door right now

22:12.357 --> 22:14.950
it wouldn't matter, 'cause
I'm not on the list, okay?

22:14.960 --> 22:18.463
So just stop pretending like
everything's gonna work out.

22:25.771 --> 22:27.106
I'm sorry.

22:29.909 --> 22:32.912
I'm sorry. I know you're doing
everything you can for me.

22:36.281 --> 22:38.383
I'm just scared.

22:40.552 --> 22:42.622
I'm scared, too.

22:46.091 --> 22:47.983
I just keep thinking that

22:47.993 --> 22:50.953
Mom would be so disappointed in me.

22:50.963 --> 22:53.422
Jessie, no.

22:53.432 --> 22:56.158
No, Mom would be so proud of you.

22:56.168 --> 22:58.160
For what?

22:58.170 --> 23:00.505
For not giving up.

23:03.475 --> 23:06.501
And I'm not giving up either.

23:06.511 --> 23:08.503
Okay?

23:08.513 --> 23:11.083
JESSIE (CRYING): Okay.

23:16.789 --> 23:18.280
Hey. Right this way.

23:18.290 --> 23:19.581
It took some convincing

23:19.591 --> 23:21.350
to get him to see us again,
so if you're not

23:21.360 --> 23:23.829
- absolutely sure about this...
- I am.

23:26.298 --> 23:27.757
Um, either of you want a coffee?

23:27.767 --> 23:29.501
Uh, no. Thank you.

23:30.703 --> 23:33.362
I didn't expect to see you again.

23:33.372 --> 23:34.964
I hope it wasn't the price

23:34.974 --> 23:37.777
that gave you cold feet,
because that's the same.

23:38.844 --> 23:40.269
$100,000.

23:40.279 --> 23:43.105
- Ten percent down.
- I have it,

23:43.115 --> 23:44.940
and, I, uh, I want to move forward,

23:44.950 --> 23:47.943
but... there's a problem.

23:47.953 --> 23:50.612
My sister isn't on
the transplant list at Chastain.

23:50.622 --> 23:53.148
- So unless...
- Doctors can be bought.

23:53.158 --> 23:54.559
Just like kidneys.

23:56.395 --> 23:58.654
I have arrangements out of state.

23:58.664 --> 24:01.133
So just be ready to travel.

24:02.367 --> 24:03.558
(SIGHS)

24:03.568 --> 24:05.327
Okay.

24:05.337 --> 24:06.672
What's next?

24:09.875 --> 24:12.001
- (IRVING CLEARS THROAT)
- MINA: Hmm.

24:12.011 --> 24:14.904
My chaperone is getting anxious.

24:14.914 --> 24:16.839
I am sorry I can't be more help.

24:16.849 --> 24:19.074
No, it's all right.
I didn't expect you to.

24:19.084 --> 24:21.811
- I'm just glad you're doing better.
- Thanks.

24:21.821 --> 24:24.089
Hey, um...

24:25.725 --> 24:27.850
maybe we were out there
for the same reasons.

24:27.860 --> 24:31.721
Figure stuff out, the things
that scare us the most.

24:31.731 --> 24:33.555
Which is?

24:33.565 --> 24:36.258
Well, for me, it's-it's what
to do with my lotto winnings.

24:36.268 --> 24:38.861
Every dollar
is another decision to make,

24:38.871 --> 24:40.840
and, uh, the money is just such a...

24:43.175 --> 24:44.767
an opportunity, and I'm just terrified

24:44.777 --> 24:47.536
that I'll do the wrong thing.

24:47.546 --> 24:48.738
And why would you think that?

24:48.748 --> 24:50.205
Well, because ever since I was a kid,

24:50.215 --> 24:52.574
I've been making the wrong call.
(CHUCKLES)

24:52.584 --> 24:56.378
PRIME EXAMPLE: when I was nine,
my folks split.

24:56.388 --> 25:00.215
Dad was moving to Dallas, and they...

25:00.225 --> 25:02.852
made me pick who to live with.

25:02.862 --> 25:05.520
(SCOFFS) They made you choose?

25:05.530 --> 25:07.522
Yep.

25:07.532 --> 25:09.624
And I picked Mom.

25:09.634 --> 25:12.271
- Hmm.
- And my dad...

25:14.639 --> 25:18.067
never forgave me.

25:18.077 --> 25:20.469
Well, I'm pretty sure
that wasn't your fault.

25:20.479 --> 25:22.704
That doesn't change my fear

25:22.714 --> 25:24.706
of making a bad choice.

25:24.716 --> 25:27.486
Especially one
that could change my life.

25:28.553 --> 25:30.612
(SIGHS)

25:30.622 --> 25:33.883
Hey, you're a doctor. That means
you have to make all kinds

25:33.893 --> 25:36.919
of life and death decisions. What-wha...
How-how? How do you do it?

25:36.929 --> 25:38.220
(CHUCKLES)

25:38.231 --> 25:40.333
You're asking the wrong person.

25:43.568 --> 25:45.327
A few weeks ago,

25:45.337 --> 25:48.440
a wonderful man who loved me proposed.

25:50.231 --> 25:53.534
I took so long to decide
that he changed his mind.

25:56.015 --> 25:57.973
Oh, so we're-we're similar in that way.

25:57.983 --> 25:59.241
No.

25:59.251 --> 26:01.076
In every other instance in my life,

26:01.086 --> 26:02.978
the correct choice was obvious.

26:02.988 --> 26:05.981
But in this instance...

26:05.991 --> 26:08.994
I weighed my options
until it was too late.

26:10.029 --> 26:12.087
(EXHALES)

26:12.097 --> 26:14.423
(CHUCKLES): So...

26:14.433 --> 26:15.825
So I guess that guy from last night

26:15.835 --> 26:17.259
must have been a rebound, then, huh?

26:17.269 --> 26:18.760
(CHUCKLES)

26:18.770 --> 26:20.162
What guy?

26:20.172 --> 26:22.865
The guy-the guy, from the country club.

26:22.875 --> 26:25.801
The, um... I saw you two inside
when I was heading out

26:25.811 --> 26:27.602
- to the course.
- What's his name?

26:27.612 --> 26:30.705
I don't know. I'm-I'm, uh,
pretty sure his dad, like,

26:30.715 --> 26:32.551
owned the club, though.

26:36.788 --> 26:39.048
On behalf of my people, would you please

26:39.058 --> 26:41.460
put the yarmulke down?

26:42.862 --> 26:45.487
We paged Grayson 20 minutes ago.

26:45.497 --> 26:48.023
- I'll find him myself.
- DEVON: Mm-mmm, mm-mmm. -Uh-uh.

26:48.033 --> 26:50.292
GRAYSON: ♪ Let me go on ♪

26:50.302 --> 26:53.128
♪ Like a blister in the sun... ♪

26:53.138 --> 26:55.197
What? Only a Green Day fan after hours?

26:55.207 --> 26:57.066
- Dude, no. Not Green Day.
- Regardless,

26:57.076 --> 27:00.745
last night it was performed
by another American treasure.

27:01.813 --> 27:04.428
IRVING: Guess we left
the party too early.

27:04.439 --> 27:06.487
Yeah, and you left before I could
get Bell his suit back. I mean,

27:06.498 --> 27:08.158
luckily, he hasn't asked
for his dry cleaning,

27:08.169 --> 27:09.378
or else ya boy would be screwed.
(CHUCKLES)

27:09.388 --> 27:10.913
Okay, why was I wearing Bell's suit?

27:10.923 --> 27:12.814
Wait, do you... You don't remember?

27:12.824 --> 27:15.250
(LAUGHS): Oh, man. Best night ever.

27:15.260 --> 27:16.886
Karaoke duets,

27:16.896 --> 27:19.188
taking shots off of random
strangers' midsections.

27:19.198 --> 27:22.191
And the pièce de résistance?

27:22.201 --> 27:25.194
Crashing Daniel Leebshitz's bar mitzvah.

27:25.204 --> 27:26.495
I mean, you were underdressed,
so I let you borrow

27:26.506 --> 27:28.124
one of the boss man's suits
to gain entry.

27:28.135 --> 27:30.599
Wait, wait, wait. I have pictures.

27:30.609 --> 27:34.203
(CHUCKLES) That is Daniel
and squad, us included.

27:34.213 --> 27:35.938
(WHOOPS) Oh, yeah.

27:35.948 --> 27:38.874
- Oy vey.
- (CHUCKLES): Oh, yeah. It was lit.

27:38.884 --> 27:41.510
Yeah. (SNIFFLES)

27:41.520 --> 27:43.178
Wait, no, no, no, no.
Those are memories.

27:43.188 --> 27:46.281
Grayson and Mina.
First Grayna adventure ever.

27:46.291 --> 27:47.932
Last adventure ever.

27:47.943 --> 27:50.052
Clearly, I came to my senses
and fled to the golf course

27:50.062 --> 27:51.286
for some peace and quiet.

27:51.296 --> 27:53.522
Well, not before pouring
your heart about

27:53.532 --> 27:56.191
how much you love surgery and dinosaurs.

27:56.201 --> 27:57.526
Dinosaurs?

27:57.536 --> 27:59.528
- That's crazy.
- Unexpected.

27:59.538 --> 28:01.306
Yeah. Specifically, velociraptors.

28:02.307 --> 28:04.399
BOTH: Raptors.

28:04.409 --> 28:06.401
- You must've heard wrong.
- GRAYSON: Uh, no.

28:06.411 --> 28:09.238
I had a video on there before
you deleted it, but whatever.

28:09.248 --> 28:10.449
Haters gonna hate.

28:11.917 --> 28:13.452
Um, no. That's not what that means.

28:15.887 --> 28:18.547
(WHISPERS): Raptors...

28:18.557 --> 28:22.051
Mm-mmm. Nope.

28:22.061 --> 28:24.319
CONRAD: I got your page.
Everything okay?

28:24.329 --> 28:26.956
Uh, yeah. There's just
one question I need help with.

28:26.966 --> 28:28.823
What do I put for
"Are there any limitations

28:28.833 --> 28:30.659
on the information
that can be released?"

28:30.669 --> 28:33.762
These are to release
your medical records, Jess.

28:33.772 --> 28:35.797
- You going somewhere?
- Nic didn't tell you?

28:35.807 --> 28:37.799
She thinks I get on the transplant list

28:37.809 --> 28:40.302
someplace else, so...

28:40.312 --> 28:42.437
Even if you're approved
and listed as a recipient

28:42.447 --> 28:44.273
at another hospital,
the wait for the kidney

28:44.283 --> 28:46.408
still takes years,
no matter where you are.

28:46.418 --> 28:49.811
You'll be on the list here in
a few months. Why not stay here?

28:49.821 --> 28:52.781
I... Hey, I just do what
the big sis tells me. (CHUCKLES)

28:52.791 --> 28:56.118
Nic seems really sure
I can get a kidney now, so...

28:56.128 --> 28:58.363
that's good, right?

28:59.631 --> 29:01.623
Right.

29:01.633 --> 29:04.159
Well, maybe I'll swing by later
to talk to her about it.

29:04.169 --> 29:05.794
Another '80s movie night?

29:05.804 --> 29:07.806
Yeah, if she doesn't bail
like she did last night.

29:08.607 --> 29:10.265
Why'd she bail last night?

29:10.275 --> 29:13.778
She rushed off to the clinic
for some emergency.

29:16.148 --> 29:17.606
BELL: Hey, there.

29:17.616 --> 29:20.309
Hey.

29:20.319 --> 29:22.144
You want to watch the sunset?

29:22.154 --> 29:23.778
It's really nice.

29:23.788 --> 29:26.448
Oh, I'd love to, but, uh, unfortunately,

29:26.458 --> 29:29.061
- I've come to say goodbye.
- Well, where are you going?

29:30.962 --> 29:33.788
Well, the truth is that um...

29:33.798 --> 29:37.526
Chastain's board is gathering
as we speak, and, uh,

29:37.536 --> 29:40.395
I don't think I'm gonna
be around much longer.

29:40.405 --> 29:43.498
- What? Why... why not?
- Because at the end of the day,

29:43.508 --> 29:45.967
a hospital is a business.

29:45.977 --> 29:48.637
And if a CEO can't find
a way to pay the bills,

29:48.647 --> 29:50.305
then the board will find one who can,

29:50.315 --> 29:52.807
whether it impacts patient care or not.

29:52.817 --> 29:55.877
I am just so sorry
to hear that, Dr. Bell.

29:55.887 --> 29:58.580
You've been so good to me.

29:58.590 --> 30:01.326
Oh, thank you, Taylor.
I appreciate that.

30:03.228 --> 30:05.420
'Cause I was always a doctor first.

30:05.430 --> 30:08.690
Never practiced anywhere but Chastain.

30:08.700 --> 30:10.902
I never-I never wanted to.

30:12.204 --> 30:14.829
When you're a-a charity
that relies on donations,

30:14.839 --> 30:17.032
and the...

30:17.042 --> 30:21.103
and the donors aren't feeling generous,

30:21.113 --> 30:23.515
there's not much you can do
but face the music.

30:28.887 --> 30:30.889
Dr. Bell, I want to help.

30:34.426 --> 30:35.927
What do you mean?

30:36.961 --> 30:38.963
I think I can.

30:49.108 --> 30:51.110
(MONITOR BEEPING RAPIDLY)

30:54.313 --> 30:55.537
BELL: What's going on?

30:55.547 --> 30:57.372
His SATs dropped into the 70s.

30:57.382 --> 31:00.628
- I was just here. He was fine.
- It's not an infection.

31:00.639 --> 31:02.811
There's no fever, his white
blood cell count's normal,

31:02.821 --> 31:04.813
yet he's worsening at an alarming rate.

31:04.823 --> 31:06.981
We should've done the bronchoscopy.

31:06.991 --> 31:08.527
You're damn right we should have.

31:10.995 --> 31:13.122
BELL: Where are we?

31:13.132 --> 31:15.376
AUSTIN: Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis.

31:15.387 --> 31:17.126
BELL: Explains his difficulty breathing.

31:17.136 --> 31:19.904
AUSTIN: Nothing a little
lung lavage can't fix.

31:23.742 --> 31:26.135
Mm. All right, here we go.

31:26.145 --> 31:28.513
Ready for some fun?

31:30.682 --> 31:32.841
BELL: Gentle. Gentle. Don't hurt him.

31:32.851 --> 31:36.311
Don't worry, I'll make sure your
golden goose lives to lay another egg.

31:36.321 --> 31:38.990
(THUMPING)

31:44.629 --> 31:46.665
Ha, ha!

Is she in with a patient?

31:59.110 --> 32:01.503
No. She's not here. Is everything okay?

32:01.513 --> 32:04.139
Eh, it's...

32:04.149 --> 32:06.841
Suddenly, Nic's very confident

32:06.851 --> 32:09.444
Jessie is gonna find a kidney soon.

32:09.454 --> 32:11.280
Transferring her to another hospital.

32:11.290 --> 32:13.671
I just... I don't know
where the kidney's coming from.

32:13.682 --> 32:15.864
Well, your guess is as good
as mine. They must've found

32:15.875 --> 32:18.019
a Good Samaritan donor
you don't know about.

32:18.029 --> 32:21.022
Yeah. Nic was here last night.
Do you know why?

32:21.032 --> 32:23.858
Sounds like you got
some trust issues to work out.

32:23.868 --> 32:25.560
(CHUCKLES) Yeah. Well, she would

32:25.570 --> 32:27.972
do anything for her sister.

32:30.008 --> 32:32.834
Whatever's going on,
I'm sure she's being smart

32:32.844 --> 32:34.636
and protecting herself.

32:34.646 --> 32:37.172
Yeah, I don't know, man, I just...

32:37.182 --> 32:39.708
can only think of one way

32:39.718 --> 32:42.010
Nic could get a kidney
for Jessie right now,

32:42.020 --> 32:43.188
and it's illegal.

32:44.637 --> 32:46.939
And I don't think she would've
thought of it on her own.

32:49.594 --> 32:51.930
Nic has a mind that's very much her own.

32:52.997 --> 32:54.389
And I'd say if she's found

32:54.399 --> 32:56.225
a way to help her sister,
that's a good thing.

what happens if this goes wrong?

She could end up in jail.

33:06.450 --> 33:08.219
Got to close up.

33:09.080 --> 33:11.570
You know, if she wanted you
involved, she would've come to you.

33:11.581 --> 33:12.907
- She didn't.
- No.

33:12.917 --> 33:14.509

All the risk is with her.

33:19.624 --> 33:21.783

- Yeah.

I know you're trying to help Nic.

33:33.738 --> 33:36.898
But this line that she's about
to cross will destroy her.

you know she's not gonna make it.
