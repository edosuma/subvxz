00:28.661 --> 00:31.421
<i>My mother always told me
I was gonna be something great.</i>

00:33.466 --> 00:36.530
<i>Don't worry. They'll see, she would say.</i>

00:38.437 --> 00:40.923
<i>It's kinda funny to think about that now.</i>

01:13.072 --> 01:14.938
Say my name, mama.

01:16.575 --> 01:19.170
The tide does seem lower than usual.

01:21.714 --> 01:25.300
<i>The mothers in town like to tell me
that she was always a little crazy.</i>

01:26.052 --> 01:28.378
<i>Even before all the kids died.</i>

01:31.090 --> 01:32.958
<i>Which is a lie.</i>

01:35.210 --> 01:37.924
<i>Truth is all the women
secretly resent my mother.</i>

01:40.466 --> 01:42.362
<i>And why wouldn't they?</i>

01:43.235 --> 01:44.999
<i>All of them dressed in black.</i>

01:45.137 --> 01:47.506
<i>Refusing to have any more children.</i>

01:49.808 --> 01:53.832
<i>Like they all agreed that the first woman to
wear color again was the worst mother in town.</i>

01:56.349 --> 01:57.873
<i>Well...</i>

01:59.118 --> 02:00.812
<i>My mother wears pink.</i>

02:21.306 --> 02:23.953
<i>I was eleven years old
when I decided to marry Soraya.</i>

02:25.144 --> 02:29.413
<i>And every day for six years
I prayed for the courage to talk to her.</i>

02:31.284 --> 02:33.306
<i>But I never did.</i>

02:33.386 --> 02:35.458
<i>So she married someone else.</i>

02:58.610 --> 03:01.133
<i>Soraya's husband
was the teacher at School...</i>

03:01.213 --> 03:05.449
<i>and he died in the wave along with my
brother Tigo and the rest of the class.</i>

03:08.954 --> 03:11.611
<i>My brother's favorite thing
was using the pencil sharpener.</i>

03:11.691 --> 03:15.494
<i>So if he was good all week Mr. Diaz
would give him a new pencil to sharpen.</i>

03:18.263 --> 03:21.282
<i>Sometimes I think about
the moment the wave hit.</i>

03:22.935 --> 03:25.063
<i>I hope it was quick.</i>

03:25.971 --> 03:28.341
<i>That they never saw it coming.</i>

03:30.542 --> 03:33.343
<i>I hope Tigo was sharpening his new pencil.</i>

03:38.150 --> 03:42.108
And the fish
that is in the river shall die.

03:42.388 --> 03:44.844
And the river shall stink.

03:45.624 --> 03:48.281
<i>Father Douglas moved here
a few years before the wave,</i>

03:48.361 --> 03:49.998
<i>and everybody loved him.</i>

03:51.430 --> 03:53.853
<i>When he finally realized people
had stopped having children,</i>

03:53.933 --> 03:56.689
<i>he made it his mission
to help them move on.</i>

03:56.769 --> 03:58.645
Not today, Father.

04:00.206 --> 04:02.337
<i>It wasn't working.</i>

04:23.896 --> 04:26.552
Maybe if you give him
some communion bread.

04:26.632 --> 04:29.435
No, Bigo. That's impossible.

04:31.971 --> 04:33.972
Hang on a second.

04:36.074 --> 04:39.788
In the name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

04:41.080 --> 04:43.477
Thank you. Thank you, Father.

04:43.616 --> 04:45.671
Can I get you anything, Father?

04:45.751 --> 04:47.844
Some water, please.

04:54.327 --> 04:56.187
Rosita.

04:56.295 --> 04:58.818
- Good morning.
- Father Douglas.

04:58.898 --> 05:01.920
Yes. How are you today?

05:02.001 --> 05:04.765
- Better.
- You look good.

05:05.171 --> 05:07.370
I brought you something.

05:11.143 --> 05:13.374
- You remembered.
- Yes.

05:16.014 --> 05:18.938
Lord, I am not worthy that you
should enter under my roof.

05:19.018 --> 05:22.223
Only say that word and I shall be healed.

05:22.322 --> 05:24.777
Rosita. The body of Christ.

05:24.857 --> 05:26.416
Amen.

05:29.462 --> 05:31.935
- Father.
- What?

05:33.065 --> 05:35.593
Do you think I'll see the children?

05:38.504 --> 05:40.837
Yes, I know that you will.

05:41.240 --> 05:44.744
Not yet. You get some rest now.

06:18.321 --> 06:20.724
<i>When my friends
started moving to the city,</i>

06:20.804 --> 06:24.695
<i>I knew it was only a matter of time
until my best friend Gabriel went too.</i>

06:25.532 --> 06:27.486
<i>For months we didn't talk about it.</i>

06:27.566 --> 06:30.835
<i>Until one day I finally said
he should go with them.</i>

06:31.924 --> 06:34.126
<i>It was the first time I ever saw him cry.</i>

06:34.226 --> 06:36.257
What the hell is that?

06:37.196 --> 06:39.217
This is my survival pack.

06:39.297 --> 06:42.801
Everything I'll ever need is in here.
Help me with it.

06:48.206 --> 06:51.134
You're gonna walk all the way
to the city with that?

06:52.945 --> 06:54.974
Let me show you something.

06:59.384 --> 07:01.987
You pushed this thing
all the way over here?

07:03.789 --> 07:05.315
Nope.

07:05.825 --> 07:07.680
You fixed it?

07:08.160 --> 07:10.449
You fixed it? I thought you said
this thing was dead.

07:10.529 --> 07:13.093
I've been working on it
for a few weeks now.

07:16.301 --> 07:19.425
This is great, man.
Congratulations. This...

07:19.505 --> 07:21.572
I thought you might need it.

07:23.843 --> 07:27.577
- What?
- I'm giving it to you. For your trip.

07:28.414 --> 07:31.304
- Come on, man. This is your dad's bike.
- Now it's yours.

07:31.884 --> 07:34.889
No one here uses it.
I want you to have it.

07:48.367 --> 07:50.445
- Hi, Gabriel.
- Hey, Father.

07:50.525 --> 07:53.901
- What time you leaving tomorrow?
- I don't know. When I wake up.

07:53.981 --> 07:56.395
All right, just make sure you
don't leave without saying goodbye.

07:56.475 --> 07:59.077
- Yes, Father.
- Good deal.

08:04.817 --> 08:06.472
Fidelia.

08:06.752 --> 08:08.785
How are you this evening?

08:09.855 --> 08:12.918
Don't open your eyes
for too long or it burns.

08:22.468 --> 08:24.164
May I?

08:28.607 --> 08:32.001
<i># No storm can shake #</i>

08:32.508 --> 08:35.868
<i># My inmost calm #</i>

08:35.948 --> 08:40.606
<i># While to that rock I'm clinging #</i>

08:40.686 --> 08:45.778
<i># For love is Lord of heaven and earth #</i>

08:45.858 --> 08:51.934
<i># How can I keep from singing? #</i>

08:59.471 --> 09:01.248
The body of Christ.

09:03.943 --> 09:06.582
- Hey, Father.
- Hey.

09:06.662 --> 09:08.732
She seems better today.

09:09.048 --> 09:10.744
Does she?

09:11.150 --> 09:12.951
I think so.

09:13.319 --> 09:14.974
That's good.

09:15.054 --> 09:17.584
- You want some coffee?
- No, thanks.

09:19.291 --> 09:21.848
Big day for Gabriel tomorrow.

09:21.928 --> 09:23.553
Yeah.

09:24.230 --> 09:26.290
What about you, Leo?

09:26.866 --> 09:29.538
- Me?
- What are your plans?

09:29.618 --> 09:33.075
- Plans for what?
- Life. Your future.

09:33.305 --> 09:36.368
Everybody else your age
has already left town.

09:38.944 --> 09:41.274
I don't know. I'm not really sure.

09:43.448 --> 09:46.281
I think you should go
with Gabriel tomorrow.

09:47.286 --> 09:50.075
I can talk to Soraya about your mother.

09:50.355 --> 09:51.923
She's got a couple of rooms available

09:52.003 --> 09:55.014
and I'm sure she'd be willing
to let your mother stay there.

09:55.594 --> 09:59.051
Why don't you go by there
in the morning and check it out?

09:59.131 --> 10:01.086
I really think your mother
would like it there.

10:01.166 --> 10:03.467
Then maybe you should ask her.

10:06.939 --> 10:10.062
Well... think about it, will you?

10:10.142 --> 10:12.170
Good night, Father.

10:31.162 --> 10:34.753
<i># Please, sweetheart #</i>

10:34.833 --> 10:37.089
<i># Hear me well #</i>

10:37.169 --> 10:42.061
<i># My love song to you, my love #</i>

10:42.141 --> 10:44.797
<i># Hear my voice #</i>

10:44.877 --> 10:50.970
<i># Tremble beneath your window #</i>

10:51.050 --> 10:53.605
<i># With this song #</i>

10:53.685 --> 10:59.746
<i># I come to deliver my soul to you #</i>

11:00.526 --> 11:03.816
<i># Forgive me #</i>

11:03.896 --> 11:08.688
<i># For interrupting your dream #</i>

11:09.468 --> 11:12.357
<i># But I couldn't wait anymore #</i>

11:12.437 --> 11:17.263
<i># And tonight I came to you to say #</i>

11:17.343 --> 11:20.176
<i># I love you #</i>

11:24.349 --> 11:27.928
That's because while you were listening
to Father Douglas ramble on

11:28.008 --> 11:29.707
about Saint Francis or whatever

11:29.787 --> 11:33.493
I was under the pews
looking up the girls' skirts.

11:38.664 --> 11:40.694
I miss girls.

11:41.800 --> 11:43.931
They smell so good.

11:46.372 --> 11:48.327
And ice cream.

11:48.407 --> 11:50.863
When was the last time you had ice cream?

11:51.543 --> 11:54.333
- A long time ago.
- A long time, right?

11:54.613 --> 11:57.149
The first thing I'm gonna do
when I get to the city...

11:57.449 --> 12:00.478
is have ice cream with a girl
that smells good.

12:36.155 --> 12:38.289
I hate this place, man.

12:43.362 --> 12:45.393
You're pissing on me.

12:48.366 --> 12:50.227
Son of a...

13:01.780 --> 13:03.611
Leo, look at this.

13:06.352 --> 13:08.215
Look at this.

15:45.310 --> 15:47.814
- Water.
- Get some water!

15:48.813 --> 15:50.881
Let me help you.

16:58.783 --> 17:03.506
I never told you this, but sometimes I like
to go out to the beach and visit your mother.

17:04.622 --> 17:07.515
Sometimes I spend all day
listening to people's problems

17:07.595 --> 17:10.044
and I just need someone to listen to me.

17:15.804 --> 17:18.461
Leo, you can talk to me if you like.

17:20.239 --> 17:21.492
About what?

17:21.573 --> 17:26.131
You and your best friend were dead for
three hours and then you came back to life.

17:26.911 --> 17:29.575
You don't think
that's worth talking about?

17:32.133 --> 17:34.636
What do you remember from last night?

17:39.391 --> 17:41.794
What about the three hours?

17:45.630 --> 17:48.016
<i>The kids all disappeared into the ocean...</i>

17:48.100 --> 17:51.052
<i>so there was never really
a funeral after the wave.</i>

17:58.393 --> 18:00.998
<i>Father Douglas told me it wasn't my fault.</i>

18:06.701 --> 18:09.296
<i>That I shouldn't feel guilty to be alive.</i>

18:12.006 --> 18:15.305
<i>That God had a special purpose for me.</i>

18:31.109 --> 18:33.172
<i>I wasn't really convinced.</i>

18:48.360 --> 18:50.258
DoÃ±a Soraya.

18:58.103 --> 18:59.672
What are you doing?

19:01.773 --> 19:04.402
The water's out in the house.

19:20.125 --> 19:21.821
Thanks.

19:43.749 --> 19:45.345
Leo.

19:48.253 --> 19:50.179
I'm glad you're okay.

22:36.921 --> 22:39.251
What is that thing in the yard, Leo?

22:40.759 --> 22:42.314
I don't know.

22:42.394 --> 22:44.197
You don't know?

22:47.065 --> 22:49.292
Are you saying you didn't build it?

22:52.370 --> 22:56.407
Look, I know you've been going through
a hard time lately. Everyone knows that.

22:57.508 --> 23:00.980
But I can't help you
if I don't know what's going on.

23:13.257 --> 23:15.485
No More! That's enough!

23:17.628 --> 23:22.157
<i>A year after the kids died, Father Douglas
suggested we rebuild the school.</i>

23:23.834 --> 23:26.724
<i>That night someone threw a rock
through his window.</i>

23:26.804 --> 23:29.468
<i>And the church was empty for a month.</i>

23:31.242 --> 23:33.345
<i>He never suggested it again.</i>

24:34.089 --> 24:35.667
Hey.

24:36.941 --> 24:39.105
Is the water still out in your house?

27:24.509 --> 27:26.310
Hey, Bigo.

27:29.113 --> 27:31.140
Is that my mother's lamp?

27:56.941 --> 27:59.010
Okay, Lela.

27:59.477 --> 28:01.478
You're gonna be all right.

28:08.686 --> 28:10.514
You'll see, Lela.

28:10.655 --> 28:13.484
- Father?
- Yes?

28:16.127 --> 28:17.996
What is it?

28:18.830 --> 28:21.095
When we left Leo's house...

28:22.033 --> 28:24.941
some of us started talking.

28:26.171 --> 28:27.892
About what?

28:28.272 --> 28:30.435
Somebody said that...

28:31.576 --> 28:33.703
that this is a sign from God.

28:34.946 --> 28:37.175
That Leo is the messenger.

28:38.917 --> 28:42.021
- Who said that?
- Everybody.

28:48.159 --> 28:49.992
Now listen...

28:53.864 --> 28:57.188
It can be very dangerous
to jump to conclusions.

28:58.268 --> 29:00.725
You know in these times
we have to stay focused on God,

29:00.805 --> 29:03.127
otherwise we can lose our way.

29:03.207 --> 29:05.830
Yes, Father. I'm sure you're right.

29:05.910 --> 29:08.699
Look, the real message
we're all looking for...

29:08.779 --> 29:12.503
is right there in the church
and it's waiting for us every day.

29:12.883 --> 29:18.576
Father, you know Oscar would never
set foot in the church again.

29:18.656 --> 29:22.015
He always says, if a man murders a child,

29:22.095 --> 29:24.615
we sentence him to death.

29:24.695 --> 29:28.220
But when God kills forty-six children...

29:28.800 --> 29:31.101
we are told to praise him.

29:33.938 --> 29:36.235
How do you feel about that?

29:36.741 --> 29:38.678
I don't know.

29:38.758 --> 29:43.542
Sometimes it does feel like God
has abandoned this place.

29:46.951 --> 29:49.214
If we only had a sign.

29:50.721 --> 29:54.858
Just the tiniest glimpse
that He still cares.

29:58.296 --> 30:00.251
And you think...

30:00.331 --> 30:03.049
that Leo might be that sign?

30:03.434 --> 30:05.573
I don't know.

30:05.653 --> 30:07.486
You spoke with Leo.

30:09.106 --> 30:11.639
Could this be a sign from God?

30:18.416 --> 30:20.783
It's possible. Yes.

31:10.468 --> 31:12.166
Soraya?

33:10.288 --> 33:12.492
Do you come here often?

33:12.723 --> 33:14.449
Sometimes.

33:15.259 --> 33:17.587
My mom used to bring us a lot as kids.

33:24.768 --> 33:27.425
<i>And by the way, thank you for the books.</i>

33:27.505 --> 33:31.162
<i>Oh, yeah. I actually read
through a few of them but...</i>

33:31.242 --> 33:33.412
<i>I couldn't understand much.</i>

33:34.495 --> 33:36.497
<i>They were my husband's.</i>

33:37.481 --> 33:41.109
<i>He used to study in bed
with a stack of books between us.</i>

33:42.186 --> 33:44.742
<i>It used to drive me insane. You know?</i>

33:44.822 --> 33:46.826
<i>That old paper smell.</i>

33:49.159 --> 33:51.530
<i>And now I can't even sleep without them.</i>

33:56.133 --> 33:58.042
<i>Can I tell you something?</i>

34:01.038 --> 34:04.061
<i>I used to go to your house and watch you.</i>

34:04.141 --> 34:07.536
<i>I mean...
it wasn't in a disrespectful way.</i>

34:09.580 --> 34:11.806
<i>I just wanted to see you.</i>

34:17.121 --> 34:18.924
I knew.

34:22.827 --> 34:24.659
<i>I always knew.</i>

35:45.843 --> 35:47.676
Mama, stop it.

35:52.016 --> 35:53.771
Mama.

35:53.851 --> 35:56.071
Fidelia, do you want more rice?

35:58.222 --> 36:00.377
- Fidelia.
- She doesn't hear you.

36:00.457 --> 36:02.885
Put it outside the fence where it belongs.

36:05.830 --> 36:07.451
You're right.

36:07.531 --> 36:09.553
I made it too mushy.

36:09.633 --> 36:11.634
The yucca's better.

36:26.216 --> 36:29.085
- <i>She's beautiful.</i>
- <i>Who?</i>

36:29.186 --> 36:32.882
Your mother. There's something
very romantic about her.

36:34.192 --> 36:35.822
Okay.

36:36.927 --> 36:39.860
I suppose men don't see
their mothers that way.

36:40.998 --> 36:43.097
She's not a mother.

36:47.771 --> 36:49.826
I didn't mean that.

36:49.906 --> 36:52.972
I understand. It must be
difficult seeing her like this.

36:54.344 --> 36:57.801
I just don't know if she would be like this
if I would have died instead of Tigo.

36:57.881 --> 37:00.909
I don't think that
would have made any difference.

37:03.053 --> 37:04.908
One time...

37:04.988 --> 37:07.244
I was swimming with my brother...

37:07.824 --> 37:10.457
and we saw this buoy far out from shore.

37:11.162 --> 37:13.583
It had a bell on it.

37:13.663 --> 37:17.834
And we didn't realize how impossible
it was so we decided to swim to it.

37:19.570 --> 37:24.161
We got too far out from shore and we both
started panicking and yelling for my mother.

37:24.641 --> 37:27.159
And finally she saw us and...

37:27.239 --> 37:30.112
jumped in the water
and started to swim towards us.

37:32.482 --> 37:34.816
I remember trying to reach her...

37:36.286 --> 37:38.317
but when she got to me...

37:40.290 --> 37:43.118
she just passed me by
and saved Tigo instead.

37:44.594 --> 37:47.823
She probably knew
you could swim better than him.

37:48.165 --> 37:50.959
Yeah. I know.

37:52.519 --> 37:54.582
But she still had a choice.

37:56.373 --> 37:58.443
And she chose him.

37:59.442 --> 38:03.700
<i>"And now with her eyes
she would look full upon his face.</i>

38:03.780 --> 38:06.537
And now again she would fail to know him.

38:07.317 --> 38:11.108
Cruel mother,
thou hast an unyielding heart...

38:11.188 --> 38:14.478
why dost thou hold aloof from my father?

38:14.558 --> 38:19.116
Why do you not sit by his side
and ask questions?

38:19.796 --> 38:23.153
No other woman would harden
her heart as thou dost...

38:23.233 --> 38:25.705
and stand aloof from her husband".

40:13.277 --> 40:17.401
I know it sounds crazy, but...
that's the truth.

40:17.481 --> 40:19.870
Bigo! What is going on?

40:19.950 --> 40:22.577
Father, it's a miracle.

40:22.786 --> 40:27.978
- What miracle? What are you talking about?
- Leo! Come and see him there!

40:28.058 --> 40:30.118
You have to believe me.

40:31.061 --> 40:33.717
You see? You see? You see, Father?

40:33.797 --> 40:38.189
Remember how she was?
See? She's happy now.

40:38.269 --> 40:39.917
Huh, Lela?

41:15.539 --> 41:17.406
SeÃ±ora Guzman.

41:20.310 --> 41:22.815
Someone had to be the first to forget.

42:26.760 --> 42:29.010
Has Soraya been sleeping here?

42:31.649 --> 42:33.475
Who said that?

42:34.485 --> 42:36.088
People talk.

42:39.022 --> 42:41.056
I don't care what people think.

42:42.326 --> 42:44.029
You hungry?

42:44.128 --> 42:45.824
Concha!

42:48.666 --> 42:50.367
Concha!

42:51.569 --> 42:53.290
Yes?

42:53.370 --> 42:56.164
Father Douglas and Leo are here for lunch.

42:59.076 --> 43:00.902
Hello, Concha.

43:01.879 --> 43:03.748
Excuse me.

43:16.727 --> 43:19.750
Oh, no, please, Father, don't.

43:19.830 --> 43:22.034
I'm so sorry for the delay.

43:48.058 --> 43:50.426
Something's happening around here.

43:52.662 --> 43:56.227
People are acting different and Father
Douglas says it's because of me.

44:00.570 --> 44:02.797
Because people think I'm special.

44:12.415 --> 44:15.250
But you know that's not true,
don't you, Mama?

44:23.993 --> 44:26.296
I want you to know that I forgive you.

44:28.565 --> 44:30.635
For pushing dad away.

44:33.770 --> 44:36.642
For pulling my ear
when the cat broke your vase.

44:41.311 --> 44:43.374
For loving Tigo more than me.

44:52.956 --> 44:54.782
Mama, stop it.

45:04.534 --> 45:06.367
You're right.

45:06.753 --> 45:08.787
I didn't give you enough corn.

45:22.719 --> 45:24.545
Please, mama.

45:32.095 --> 45:34.199
I know you can hear me!

46:07.064 --> 46:08.437
Where's Leo?

46:57.180 --> 46:59.669
Is this some sort of game?

46:59.749 --> 47:02.814
You're playing to prove
how clever you are, Leo?

47:04.554 --> 47:08.044
All right, so now it's a boat.
Congratulations, that's wonderful.

47:08.124 --> 47:11.723
What are you gonna do with it?
And please don't tell me you don't know.

47:14.564 --> 47:17.069
Will you say something for Christ's sake?

47:19.419 --> 47:21.297
I want to sail it.

47:22.439 --> 47:24.336
You can't be serious.

47:24.941 --> 47:26.629
- Why not?
- Why not?

47:26.709 --> 47:30.272
What do you think will happen
to that thing if you put it on the water?

47:31.147 --> 47:33.837
- I don't know.
- I do know.

47:33.917 --> 47:36.874
It will sink, Leo. Immediately.

47:36.954 --> 47:40.076
- It might not.
- Oh, it would, I promise you.

47:40.156 --> 47:42.812
And have you given any thought to the
effect that would have on the people?

47:42.892 --> 47:46.449
<i>Have you thought about that, Leo?
It would be a disaster.</i>

47:46.529 --> 47:49.853
<i>And even if by some miracle
it did not sink, what would that prove?</i>

47:49.933 --> 47:52.838
<i>What the hell would that prove, Leo?</i>

47:54.838 --> 47:59.241
No, no, we'll disassemble it and we'll put
everything back the way you found it.

48:00.610 --> 48:03.673
And maybe everything can return to normal.

48:04.214 --> 48:06.861
Whatever the hell that is.

48:14.758 --> 48:18.295
<i>After Tigo died, my dad
started sleeping on the couch.</i>

48:21.531 --> 48:25.220
<i>When he finally left,
he gave me his lucky pocket knife.</i>

48:26.503 --> 48:28.767
<i>She's pretending, he said.</i>

48:38.882 --> 48:41.146
<i>I threw that knife in the sea.</i>

48:48.925 --> 48:52.422
- Sorry about that.
- It's okay.

48:53.897 --> 48:55.630
All right.

48:56.233 --> 48:58.464
So, what can I do for you?

49:03.506 --> 49:06.009
I had a dream last night, Father.

49:08.679 --> 49:11.375
It's okay. Tell him.

49:15.919 --> 49:17.808
I was giving birth,

49:17.888 --> 49:22.394
but instead of a child,
a river of water poured out of me.

49:24.394 --> 49:29.264
It was so much water, it ran through
the streets and flooded the whole town.

49:30.950 --> 49:34.581
So everyone piled into Leo's boat.

49:35.271 --> 49:37.368
It was bigger in my dream.

49:38.508 --> 49:44.143
And then we all sailed to an island where
the children were laughing and playing.

49:45.482 --> 49:48.798
Then... Primo woke me up.

49:49.853 --> 49:52.417
She was laughing in her sleep.

49:56.392 --> 49:59.095
So what do you think this means, Father?

50:02.299 --> 50:04.388
I don't really know.

50:05.101 --> 50:07.172
I think that's for you to decide.

50:13.326 --> 50:15.129
What is it?

50:15.512 --> 50:17.200
Well...

50:17.280 --> 50:19.307
we did decide, actually.

50:20.584 --> 50:22.472
Decide what?

50:22.852 --> 50:25.475
We weren't sure if the timing is right...

50:26.055 --> 50:28.626
but we want to try and have another baby.

50:38.735 --> 50:41.299
Good for you. Congratulations.

50:43.573 --> 50:46.163
Congratulations. Good for you.

50:46.243 --> 50:48.565
Good for you.

50:48.645 --> 50:52.308
Father, Son, Holy Spirit.

50:54.451 --> 50:56.382
- Thank you.
- Wonderful.

51:58.280 --> 52:00.904
Here, Carmen.
Here's the matching color for that.

52:00.984 --> 52:04.374
Yes, that's great.
Put the green edge with the white one.

52:04.454 --> 52:07.743
Yes, pull those together.
They're gonna have to be doubled.

52:07.823 --> 52:10.280
Are you using
a strong enough thread on that?

52:10.360 --> 52:15.025
No, wait, I think you should use this.
Remember these are gonna be double edged.

52:29.202 --> 52:30.808
Hi.

52:31.114 --> 52:32.846
Hi, Leo.

52:34.317 --> 52:35.979
Bigo.

52:36.419 --> 52:38.641
I was thinking...

52:39.221 --> 52:43.051
maybe I should leave Lela here
with the cart.

52:43.860 --> 52:46.064
If you have to move anything else.

52:48.365 --> 52:50.728
Okay. Thanks.

52:57.440 --> 52:59.996
Just remember me...

53:00.076 --> 53:02.077
when the time comes.

53:09.953 --> 53:11.784
Hey, Leo.

53:15.192 --> 53:17.052
Looking good.

53:21.898 --> 53:23.477
Pretty solid.

53:24.601 --> 53:26.402
What's that?

53:27.070 --> 53:29.467
It's a sail. For you.

53:30.073 --> 53:32.476
- A sail?
- Yeah.

53:33.743 --> 53:37.311
The mothers from the community
got together and made it for you.

53:39.983 --> 53:42.014
May I sit down a while?

53:45.855 --> 53:47.915
Listen, I, uh...

53:48.791 --> 53:52.862
I feel badly about the way I spoke to you the
other day. I hope there's no hard feelings.

53:53.563 --> 53:56.453
Okay. And you know...

53:57.333 --> 54:00.538
Leo, I've been thinking a lot
about this boat of yours lately...

54:00.837 --> 54:03.192
Thinking... what it means.

54:03.272 --> 54:05.595
How it can serve the people.

54:05.875 --> 54:07.763
And it occurred to me...

54:07.843 --> 54:11.801
that maybe this boat
is not meant to sail at all.

54:11.881 --> 54:15.717
That maybe it is meant
as a symbol of some kind.

54:15.797 --> 54:19.584
- A symbol?
- Yeah. Would that be such a bad thing?

54:19.756 --> 54:21.043
And you know what?

54:21.123 --> 54:25.042
We can move it closer to the church
so that it has a more central location.

54:25.122 --> 54:28.250
Everybody could see it
all the time day and night.

54:28.330 --> 54:31.395
And it could be a great source
of inspiration, Leo.

54:33.686 --> 54:36.125
Leo, give it some thought.

54:36.405 --> 54:40.230
Because, you know, I think God
has given you a great opportunity here.

54:40.310 --> 54:42.514
And we don't want to waste it.

54:44.613 --> 54:48.547
I would offer you coffee,
but the water's still out.

54:53.723 --> 54:56.822
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah.

54:59.528 --> 55:01.832
How did people act when I died?

55:04.233 --> 55:07.160
- Why do you ask?
- I don't know.

55:08.738 --> 55:10.698
I'm just curious.

55:12.775 --> 55:14.874
Did anyone care?

55:18.815 --> 55:21.120
I guess it happened so fast.

55:27.473 --> 55:29.679
Well, I should get home.

55:29.759 --> 55:32.916
- Will I see you tomorrow?
- No.

55:33.596 --> 55:36.127
I think I can finish everything on my own.

58:11.748 --> 58:13.356
Leo!

58:26.002 --> 58:28.031
You have to help me.

58:54.013 --> 58:56.074
Leo is here.

58:58.668 --> 59:01.932
It's okay now. It's okay now, Rosita.

59:02.705 --> 59:05.732
Come on! Do something!

59:07.577 --> 59:09.403
Help her!

59:10.146 --> 59:13.202
Rosita. Rosita. Rosita, stay with me.

59:13.282 --> 59:15.939
Stay with me, Rosita. Rosita, Rosita.

59:16.019 --> 59:19.979
Don't let go, Rosita.
No, no, no. Rosita, no, no, no.

59:20.059 --> 59:22.771
Breathe. Breathe, Rosita.

59:32.902 --> 59:36.674
No, no, no, no. No, no.

01:00:04.100 --> 01:00:05.867
Get out.

01:00:09.622 --> 01:00:11.455
Get out.

01:00:14.243 --> 01:00:16.372
Get out of here!

01:00:21.250 --> 01:00:23.073
Rosita!

01:00:32.128 --> 01:00:35.718
But I don't understand.
You were both so excited about it.

01:00:35.798 --> 01:00:39.855
But I don't see the point in bringing
a child into so much sadness.

01:00:39.935 --> 01:00:44.260
It's natural to mourn death.
Didn't Jesus himself mourn poor Lazarus?

01:00:44.340 --> 01:00:46.637
We mustn't give up hope.

01:00:54.850 --> 01:00:57.339
- How is he?
- Not good.

01:00:57.419 --> 01:00:59.917
He's been sitting there all night.

01:01:08.931 --> 01:01:10.561
Pedro.

01:01:15.971 --> 01:01:18.303
Why do you have that machete?

01:01:21.944 --> 01:01:24.443
I thought about killing his mother.

01:01:26.682 --> 01:01:28.886
Make him feel what I feel.

01:01:30.753 --> 01:01:33.183
He's only a boy, Pedro.

01:01:36.759 --> 01:01:39.164
And when did you decide that?

01:01:52.975 --> 01:01:55.898
- What are you doing?
- Soraya and I are leaving town.

01:01:55.978 --> 01:01:57.460
- When?
- Today.

01:01:57.540 --> 01:01:59.835
- Now.
- No, son. You can't do that.

01:01:59.915 --> 01:02:02.176
Not now. The people need you.

01:02:02.685 --> 01:02:06.042
- I can't do anything for them.
- Now you listen to me, son.

01:02:06.122 --> 01:02:09.078
The people are confused.
They need something to believe in now.

01:02:09.158 --> 01:02:12.420
Yeah, well... that's your job.

01:02:13.095 --> 01:02:15.117
You listen to me!

01:02:15.197 --> 01:02:17.886
I cannot do this alone.

01:02:17.966 --> 01:02:20.923
Now you help me
get that boat to the church.

01:02:21.003 --> 01:02:23.475
And show them you have not given up.

01:02:24.006 --> 01:02:25.905
I'll do the rest.

01:02:29.178 --> 01:02:31.305
You owe them that much.

01:02:49.065 --> 01:02:51.032
Father Douglas?

01:02:51.767 --> 01:02:53.623
<i>Careful!</i>

01:02:53.703 --> 01:02:56.465
Careful! Steady!

01:02:59.575 --> 01:03:01.164
Careful!

01:03:01.244 --> 01:03:04.901
Carefully! Careful! That's it.
That's it. A little more!

01:03:04.981 --> 01:03:08.945
A little more, we got it!
That's it! That's it!

01:03:09.051 --> 01:03:10.852
Careful!

01:03:12.488 --> 01:03:14.792
Whoa! That'll do it!

01:03:36.145 --> 01:03:39.783
- He's there with Leo.
- I told you!

01:04:02.705 --> 01:04:04.333
Leo.

01:04:05.474 --> 01:04:07.708
We're doing the right thing.

01:04:34.737 --> 01:04:37.933
There she is! She's helping them!

01:05:39.268 --> 01:05:41.501
Get away from me!

01:05:41.704 --> 01:05:43.908
Get away from me!

01:05:52.281 --> 01:05:54.170
Stop it!

01:05:54.250 --> 01:05:57.957
What the hell are you doing?
Get out of there!

01:06:03.309 --> 01:06:06.265
Help me! Help me, please!

01:06:06.345 --> 01:06:09.413
Don't let it burn! Help me!

01:06:12.568 --> 01:06:16.225
What's the matter with you people?
Help me, please!

01:06:16.305 --> 01:06:19.436
We can't let it burn! Help me!

01:06:28.017 --> 01:06:31.741
Help me, please!
Please, help me for God's sake!

01:06:31.821 --> 01:06:33.849
What are you doing?

01:12:04.820 --> 01:12:06.951
Come on, help us!

01:13:04.979 --> 01:13:08.537
Sometimes I think about
how different things could be...

01:13:09.717 --> 01:13:13.213
if that wave had just struck
in the middle of the night.

01:13:16.491 --> 01:13:18.925
All the children safe in bed.

01:13:20.762 --> 01:13:23.045
The next day everyone...

01:13:23.425 --> 01:13:28.261
so grateful 'cause they realize
they had avoided a tragedy.

01:13:30.706 --> 01:13:32.933
Can you imagine it?

01:13:34.209 --> 01:13:37.766
People would talk about it for years.
What a miracle, they'd say.

01:13:37.846 --> 01:13:39.916
What a miracle.

01:13:41.116 --> 01:13:44.549
Same wave struck the same building...

01:13:45.120 --> 01:13:47.950
just at a different time.

01:13:51.593 --> 01:13:54.688
All my life I've believed in miracles.

01:13:56.598 --> 01:13:59.396
Now I think maybe a miracle is...

01:14:00.068 --> 01:14:02.099
just a tragedy...

01:14:03.238 --> 01:14:05.736
narrowly avoided by chance.

01:14:11.480 --> 01:14:13.347
I'm sorry.

01:18:30.706 --> 01:18:32.265
Tigo.

01:18:42.684 --> 01:18:44.312
Leo.

01:18:45.120 --> 01:18:47.399
Leo!

01:18:47.789 --> 01:18:49.882
Leo!

01:18:50.058 --> 01:18:51.725
Leo!

01:18:55.197 --> 01:18:57.030
Leo!

01:19:06.408 --> 01:19:08.104
Mama.

01:19:09.378 --> 01:19:11.428
Leo!

01:19:12.214 --> 01:19:14.236
Leo!

01:19:14.316 --> 01:19:16.041
No!

01:20:15.843 --> 01:20:20.173
<i>One time Father Douglas told me
we're all like raindrops falling from the sky.</i>

01:20:22.433 --> 01:20:25.586
<i>You feel alone right now, he explained.</i>

01:20:25.936 --> 01:20:27.837
<i>But someday you'll melt into the ocean</i>

01:20:27.917 --> 01:20:31.369
<i>and realize you're connected
to every raindrop in the world.</i>

01:20:36.347 --> 01:20:38.236
<i>Maybe he's right.</i>

01:20:38.916 --> 01:20:42.289
<i>Maybe we're all just trying
to melt back into each other.</i>

01:20:43.588 --> 01:20:45.691
<i>I don't really know.</i>

01:20:48.926 --> 01:20:51.397
<i>But if I ever do reach that ocean...</i>

01:20:53.297 --> 01:20:55.424
<i>I don't think I'll be afraid.</i>

01:20:59.253 --> 01:21:01.516
<i>And I don't feel alone anymore.</i>

01:21:02.305 --> 01:21:08.299
