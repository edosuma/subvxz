♪

00:34.969 --> 00:37.703
Goodnight, Walter.

00:37.738 --> 00:48.747
♪

01:00.428 --> 01:01.160
[sighs]

01:01.195 --> 01:03.128
This is nice, isn't it?

01:03.164 --> 01:06.832
Nice leisurely stroll,
with a pretty lady on my arm.

01:06.867 --> 01:08.667
You're just glad I let you
out of our run this morning.

01:08.702 --> 01:09.435
[laughs]

01:09.470 --> 01:10.769
Yes, I am very glad.

01:10.805 --> 01:12.638
But mostly glad to be
with you.

01:12.673 --> 01:14.139
You're such a charmer.

01:14.175 --> 01:16.942
Well, you know we have a very
special date coming up.

01:16.977 --> 01:19.111
Do we?

01:19.146 --> 01:20.145
Well...

01:20.181 --> 01:22.314
I know it's the anniversary
of our first date.

01:22.349 --> 01:23.315
Oh, that was not nice.

01:23.350 --> 01:24.316
I'm sorry.

01:24.351 --> 01:26.318
You're just very cute
when you're befuddled.

01:26.353 --> 01:27.920
I accept that apology.

01:27.955 --> 01:30.923
So, as I was saying, why don't
we do something special?

01:30.958 --> 01:31.990
I like the sound of that.

01:32.026 --> 01:33.125
Great.

01:34.995 --> 01:35.761
Hey, isn't that-

01:35.796 --> 01:36.962
Clayton Morrel.

01:36.997 --> 01:39.198
The murderer who was just
granted parole four months ago.

01:39.233 --> 01:41.333
He's out with his
own autobiography.

01:41.368 --> 01:42.968
People love to read
about true crime

01:43.003 --> 01:44.803
and his release
was big news.

01:44.839 --> 01:47.372
There's a real fascination
with the psychology of murder

01:47.408 --> 01:48.707
but I know a lot of people

01:48.742 --> 01:50.876
who are going to be triggered
by this.

01:50.911 --> 01:51.944
Are you alright?

01:51.979 --> 01:54.313
I know you were second chair
on his murder trial.

01:54.348 --> 01:55.781
This can't be easy for you.

01:55.816 --> 01:58.684
I'm fine but Paulina on
the other hand is not coping

01:58.719 --> 02:02.020
and the District Attorney cannot
afford to be distracted by this.

02:02.056 --> 02:03.856
The media has not been nice
to her.

02:03.891 --> 02:05.357
It's true.

02:06.827 --> 02:08.127
I have to get
to the office, uh,

02:08.162 --> 02:08.994
do you want a ride?

02:09.029 --> 02:10.496
I'll walk from here.

02:10.531 --> 02:11.830
Bye.

02:17.905 --> 02:19.138
Hailey Dean.

02:19.173 --> 02:20.639
Mr. Morrel.

02:20.674 --> 02:22.908
I haven't seen you since
I got out.

02:22.943 --> 02:24.009
Don't worry, I didn't
take personally

02:24.044 --> 02:26.912
that stuff you said about me
at the parole hearing.

02:26.947 --> 02:27.880
Well, I meant every word.

02:27.915 --> 02:30.582
You still belong behind bars.

02:30.618 --> 02:33.051
State of Georgia doesn't agree
with you it seems.

02:33.087 --> 02:35.487
You comin' to my book signing
tonight?

02:36.457 --> 02:37.656
That's too bad.

02:37.691 --> 02:39.992
I mean, you're in the book
after all.

02:40.027 --> 02:42.427
Don't worry I didn't say
anything bad about you.

02:42.463 --> 02:44.263
I can't say the same
for your friend, Paulina.

02:44.298 --> 02:45.564
I doubt you're on
a first-name basis

02:45.599 --> 02:46.598
with the District Attorney.

02:46.634 --> 02:50.202
She and I are like two sides
of the same coin.

02:50.237 --> 02:52.671
She's a lot more like me
than she wants to admit.

02:52.706 --> 02:54.339
I doubt she'd see it that way.

02:54.375 --> 02:57.009
If you see her, you should
bring her along tonight.

02:57.044 --> 03:01.280
My fans would be thrilled
to watch the sparks fly.

03:01.315 --> 03:03.615
It was really good to see you.

03:03.651 --> 03:05.517
Take care of yourself.

03:10.324 --> 03:11.723
I don't know Fincher,

03:11.759 --> 03:13.292
he doesn't scare me
but when I saw him,

03:13.327 --> 03:16.195
I got the feeling that something
was gonna happen.

03:16.230 --> 03:18.197
What kinda something?

03:18.232 --> 03:18.697
I'm not sure.

03:18.732 --> 03:19.865
But nothing good.

03:19.900 --> 03:22.568
Well your instincts are on
the money but you can't stop

03:22.603 --> 03:24.770
Clayton Morrel from doing
whatever he's gonna do.

03:24.805 --> 03:26.238
I know.

03:26.273 --> 03:28.073
But he's on parole.

03:28.108 --> 03:29.975
He has to report in regularly

03:30.010 --> 03:31.810
and he's subject
to surprise visits

03:31.845 --> 03:34.213
and he has a neighbour
that watches his every move.

03:34.248 --> 03:35.247
Walter Faraday.

03:35.282 --> 03:36.148
You're right.

03:36.183 --> 03:37.316
It's all so unsettling.

03:37.351 --> 03:38.584
Yeah, I agree.

03:38.619 --> 03:39.585
You talk to Paulina?

03:39.620 --> 03:42.421
Yeah, I called her but
she was in a meeting.

03:42.456 --> 03:44.656
I think I'm gonna stop
by the office after this.

03:44.692 --> 03:46.225
It's a good idea.

03:46.260 --> 03:47.826
She could use a friend.

03:47.861 --> 03:48.827
A friend like you.

03:48.862 --> 03:51.096
Yup. The best kind of friend.

03:51.131 --> 03:52.130
What kind is that?

03:52.166 --> 03:52.998
The kind of friend that helps
you eat the food

03:53.033 --> 03:53.899
that you are not eating
very quickly.

03:53.934 --> 03:56.435
Hey this is my food.
Don't you eat it.

03:56.470 --> 03:58.303
Okay.

03:58.339 --> 03:59.805
Let me ask you some advice.

03:59.840 --> 04:00.806
Always.

04:00.841 --> 04:02.407
Let's say I was gonna buy
Meghan a present.

04:02.443 --> 04:03.108
Like a ring.

04:03.143 --> 04:04.910
Oooh.

04:04.945 --> 04:05.944
You're gonna buy Meghan a ring?

04:05.980 --> 04:06.645
As an example.

04:06.680 --> 04:09.114
No, no, a ring isn't an example.

04:09.149 --> 04:10.749
Are you asking Meghan
to marry you?

04:10.784 --> 04:12.951
Oh, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

04:12.987 --> 04:14.119
Fincher, you see why
I'm asking?

04:14.154 --> 04:16.121
You don't just buy
a woman a ring.

04:16.156 --> 04:17.789
Why not? It's just like any
other piece of jewellery.

04:17.825 --> 04:19.124
No, no, it's not.

04:19.159 --> 04:20.192
A woman sees a ring box

04:20.227 --> 04:22.494
and she automatically assumes
that's a proposal.

04:22.529 --> 04:23.829
Okay, how about a bracelet then?

04:23.864 --> 04:24.796
Okay.

04:24.832 --> 04:26.031
So, what's the occasion?

04:26.066 --> 04:27.266
Hmm?

04:27.301 --> 04:29.034
[chewing]
Oh, her birthday.

04:29.069 --> 04:30.769
Well, when is it?
I want to get her something too.

04:30.804 --> 04:32.771
I said birthday. I meant
because day.

04:32.806 --> 04:33.538
Just because.

04:33.574 --> 04:34.339
Oh, right.

04:34.375 --> 04:34.973
Mmhmm.

04:35.009 --> 04:36.041
Okay.

04:36.076 --> 04:36.942
Because day.

04:36.977 --> 04:38.443
You know what?

04:38.479 --> 04:39.478
I've got some work stuff
to get to.

04:39.513 --> 04:41.713
You know we can talk later.
What'd you think?

04:41.749 --> 04:42.547
Fincher?

04:42.583 --> 04:43.515
Mmhmm?

04:43.550 --> 04:46.385
Where are you going?
I drove.

04:46.420 --> 04:47.319
Yes, you did.

04:47.354 --> 04:49.221
Yes, you did.

04:49.256 --> 04:51.990
This whole work thing got me,
uh, preoccupied.

04:52.026 --> 04:52.557
Good.

04:52.593 --> 04:53.525
This is real good man!

04:53.560 --> 04:54.860
Thanks, Matt.

04:58.432 --> 05:01.133
Yes Mr. Mayor we are fully
engaged on the Gratham case

05:01.168 --> 05:03.902
and I promise the missing
recording will be located

05:03.937 --> 05:05.504
by the end of the day.

05:05.539 --> 05:06.872
Thank you.

05:12.112 --> 05:13.412
Is this a bad time?

05:13.447 --> 05:15.013
Oh Hailey, not at all.

05:15.049 --> 05:16.515
You remember Alex Mathers?

05:16.550 --> 05:17.215
Of course.

05:17.251 --> 05:18.350
Hi, Alex.

05:18.385 --> 05:20.085
Feels like only yesterday
we were newbies together.

05:20.120 --> 05:21.320
And look at you now.

05:21.355 --> 05:23.989
Second in command to the DA,
right on schedule if I remember.

05:24.024 --> 05:26.325
Alex, if you could get on that
problem we were discussing.

05:26.360 --> 05:27.592
Of course.

05:27.628 --> 05:28.427
Thank you.

05:28.462 --> 05:29.394
Nice to see you Hailey.

05:29.430 --> 05:30.629
You too.

05:32.733 --> 05:34.700
Seems a bit stressful
around here.

05:34.735 --> 05:35.934
I don't know what's happening.

05:35.969 --> 05:38.203
I always run such a tight ship.

05:38.238 --> 05:40.272
But all of a sudden there's
all these missing files,

05:40.307 --> 05:42.407
missing meetings,
things have gone haywire,

05:42.443 --> 05:44.042
I don't know what's going on.

05:44.078 --> 05:45.944
Think you're a bit distracted?

05:45.979 --> 05:47.412
Distracted by what?

05:47.448 --> 05:49.681
I assume you know about
Clayton Morrel's book.

05:49.717 --> 05:52.117
I was sent an advance copy
if you can believe it

05:52.152 --> 05:54.786
along with an invitation
to the local book signing.

05:54.822 --> 05:55.687
So, have you read it?

05:55.723 --> 05:56.855
Absolutely not.

05:56.890 --> 05:59.725
Well I know I've been a bit
thrown by the whole thing

05:59.760 --> 06:02.594
so I can only imagine
how you must be feeling.

06:02.629 --> 06:05.397
Hailey, I know your intentions
are good

06:05.432 --> 06:07.199
but I don't need a therapist.

06:07.234 --> 06:09.634
What I need is to get
my office in order

06:09.670 --> 06:12.070
and Clayton Morrel
out of my head.

06:12.106 --> 06:13.338
Alright.

06:13.374 --> 06:16.074
Well you let me know if you need
any help talking things through.

06:16.110 --> 06:17.676
You know I will.

06:18.912 --> 06:20.545
[sighs]

06:23.517 --> 06:25.617
<i> Not only does</i>
<i> convicted murderer,</i>

06:25.652 --> 06:27.886
<i> wife killer Clayton Morrel</i>

06:27.921 --> 06:30.288
get parole after just
one parole hearing

06:30.324 --> 06:33.558
which I have never seen
in the history of paroles.

06:33.594 --> 06:37.462
Morrel is now practically
parading with a new book.

06:37.498 --> 06:39.998
Yes, you heard me, a new book.

06:40.033 --> 06:44.636
Details his life including
the murder of his wife, Tamara

06:44.671 --> 06:46.438
and that's what I call
blood money.

06:46.473 --> 06:48.073
<i> Clearly the parole board...</i>

06:48.108 --> 06:49.508
Hey. Someone wanted
to say hello.

06:49.543 --> 06:51.109
Amelia, nice to see you again.

06:51.145 --> 06:53.278
I'm so glad you kept up
your work with Sabrina.

06:53.313 --> 06:55.947
I know how difficult these last
few months have been for you.

06:55.983 --> 06:59.317
Honestly, I don't know what I
would've done without Sabrina.

06:59.353 --> 07:00.685
We're always here for you.

07:00.721 --> 07:03.355
Thank you.

07:03.390 --> 07:06.425
The book that Clayton wrote
about my sister's murder

07:06.460 --> 07:09.127
is affecting me
more than I thought.

07:09.163 --> 07:11.797
Well, understandably.

07:11.832 --> 07:13.698
But there's something else,
isn't there?

07:13.734 --> 07:17.169
I saw the poster for the book,
in the background is a vase

07:17.204 --> 07:20.205
my parents gave to my sister
on her wedding day to Clayton.

07:20.240 --> 07:21.373
That must have been a shock.

07:21.408 --> 07:24.276
He moved back into the house
where he killed my sister

07:24.311 --> 07:26.178
and now I find out he still has
Tamara's things?

07:26.213 --> 07:28.046
I mean I admit I kind of
lost it.

07:28.081 --> 07:29.181
What happened?

07:29.216 --> 07:30.315
I went to the house,

07:30.350 --> 07:32.884
the spare key was in the same
place Tamara kept it,

07:32.920 --> 07:34.519
behind the mailbox.

07:34.555 --> 07:38.523
I walk up to the house,
but something stops me,

07:38.559 --> 07:40.459
I can almost see my sister
sitting on the porch

07:40.494 --> 07:42.694
just warning me not to go in.

07:42.729 --> 07:45.163
I turn to leave and just
then Clayton drove up.

07:45.199 --> 07:47.299
I asked him for the vase,
he refused.

07:47.334 --> 07:49.501
He said he was going to file
a restraining order

07:49.536 --> 07:52.504
and that I'd been stalking the
house ever since he got out.

07:52.539 --> 07:53.338
Had you?

07:53.373 --> 07:55.640
No, I hadn't been back
in 10 years.

07:55.676 --> 07:56.808
If I hadn't seen the poster,

07:56.844 --> 07:58.477
I wouldn't have remembered
the vase.

07:58.512 --> 07:59.478
It's a family heirloom.

07:59.513 --> 08:02.714
It means nothing to him
but everything to me.

08:02.749 --> 08:04.483
I should've known better.

08:04.518 --> 08:05.517
I'm a teacher.

08:05.552 --> 08:08.220
If this complaint sticks,
I could lose my job.

08:08.255 --> 08:10.088
I know some people
at Atlanta PD.

08:10.123 --> 08:12.090
I'll see what I can find out.

08:12.125 --> 08:14.726
But why do I get the feeling
this is not a social call?

08:14.761 --> 08:16.495
I don't suppose you could
tell me if someone's filed

08:16.530 --> 08:18.196
a restraining order?

08:18.232 --> 08:19.331
What's the name?

08:19.366 --> 08:20.665
Clayton Morrel.

08:20.701 --> 08:22.334
Is he harassing someone?

08:22.369 --> 08:24.269
Because I'll have to report that
to his parole officer.

08:24.304 --> 08:27.005
He claims he's the one
being harassed.

08:27.040 --> 08:28.840
Well, let's see if
he's filed anything.

08:28.876 --> 08:31.776
[keyboard clicks]

08:31.812 --> 08:33.612
Yes actually, he filed
a complaint

08:33.647 --> 08:35.747
against Amelia Lincoln.

08:35.782 --> 08:36.915
Isn't that his ex sister-in-law?

08:36.950 --> 08:37.949
Yes.

08:37.985 --> 08:38.650
What can we do about it?

08:38.685 --> 08:39.684
Well, you know how this goes.

08:39.720 --> 08:41.887
Only the complainant
can rescind the complaint.

08:41.922 --> 08:45.490
I know, I was just hoping
for any other alternative.

08:52.065 --> 08:54.065
Thanks for coming with me.

08:55.102 --> 08:57.135
I'm dreading this but I would
rather talk to Clayton Morrel

08:57.170 --> 08:58.770
about dropping the complaint
against Amelia

08:58.805 --> 09:00.872
in a public setting.

09:00.908 --> 09:02.407
Now you know I wasn't gonna
let you come alone.

09:02.442 --> 09:04.242
Where is everybody?

09:04.278 --> 09:05.377
I thought this would be
a big draw.

09:05.412 --> 09:08.647
Yeah me too, even if it was
out of morbid curiosity.

09:08.682 --> 09:10.782
Excuse me, is the book
signing cancelled?

09:10.817 --> 09:11.583
Yes.

09:11.618 --> 09:12.584
Unfortunately.

09:12.619 --> 09:15.086
I'm afraid the author
isn't able to make it.

09:15.122 --> 09:16.154
But would you like a copy?

09:16.189 --> 09:18.823
It is very well written,
humanizes the whole thing.

09:18.859 --> 09:19.624
No thanks.

09:19.660 --> 09:23.461
I am very familiar
with the story.

09:23.497 --> 09:25.163
Are you Hailey Dean, right?

09:25.198 --> 09:27.098
You were part of the prosecution
at Clayton's trial.

09:27.134 --> 09:27.933
Yes.

09:27.968 --> 09:28.900
That's right.

09:28.936 --> 09:29.834
I'm Frank Burlett.

09:29.870 --> 09:31.269
I was there.

09:31.305 --> 09:32.771
I've known Clayton
since university.

09:32.806 --> 09:34.673
Since college.

09:34.708 --> 09:35.607
Right.

09:35.642 --> 09:36.575
I'm from up north.

09:36.610 --> 09:39.010
Came down for second year
and just stayed.

09:39.046 --> 09:40.245
You mean sophomore year.

09:40.280 --> 09:41.012
[laughs]

09:41.048 --> 09:42.581
Right. Yes.

09:42.616 --> 09:44.950
I can't ever seem to adapt
to talking about it like that.

09:44.985 --> 09:49.087
Interesting how you're still
friends with Clayton Morrel.

09:49.122 --> 09:50.488
I know it doesn't
make me popular.

09:50.524 --> 09:52.457
But I always believed Clayton
when he told me

09:52.492 --> 09:54.092
it was an accident.

09:54.127 --> 09:57.262
That he shot Tamara because
he thought she was an intruder.

09:57.297 --> 09:58.597
He's my friend.

09:58.632 --> 10:00.131
Friends stand by one another.

10:00.167 --> 10:01.800
Well he's lucky to have you
in his life.

10:01.835 --> 10:02.867
I'm not sure he feels
the same way

10:02.903 --> 10:05.971
or he wouldn't have blown off
this book signing.

10:06.006 --> 10:07.872
Did he give you a reason?

10:07.908 --> 10:09.774
Aw, I can't reach him
on his phone.

10:09.810 --> 10:10.642
[sighs]

10:10.677 --> 10:12.911
It's not surprising.

10:14.414 --> 10:16.348
Hmm.

10:16.383 --> 10:17.849
Hailey Dean.

10:17.884 --> 10:18.717
What are you doing here?

10:18.752 --> 10:20.185
Derek Robinson.

10:20.220 --> 10:22.387
Do you still represent
Clayton Morrel?

10:22.422 --> 10:27.192
Not that it's any of your
business, but yes.

10:27.227 --> 10:28.793
Why does he need an attorney?

10:28.829 --> 10:30.061
[chuckles]

10:30.097 --> 10:33.698
Because of people like you who
refuse to let him live in peace.

10:33.734 --> 10:35.500
Clayton served his time.

10:35.535 --> 10:36.301
He was released.

10:36.336 --> 10:38.737
He has rights like
everyone else.

10:38.772 --> 10:42.874
Including the right to privacy.

10:43.443 --> 10:44.342
[car doors shut]

10:44.378 --> 10:46.244
I'd rather not talk to him
on his own turf

10:46.279 --> 10:48.580
but there doesn't appear
to be a choice.

10:48.615 --> 10:51.383
Do you think you can get Clayton
Morrel to listen to reason?

10:51.418 --> 10:52.884
No, but I owe it to Amelia
to try.

10:52.919 --> 10:55.153
She's been through
enough already.

10:55.188 --> 10:56.721
Do you think she was the one
watching the house?

10:56.757 --> 10:58.223
I believed her
when she denied it.

10:58.258 --> 10:59.591
There's a car in the driveway.

10:59.626 --> 11:01.192
Well maybe he and his wife
had two cars

11:01.228 --> 11:02.694
and they went somewhere
together.

11:02.729 --> 11:04.663
Somewhere other
than the book signing?

11:04.698 --> 11:05.597
Maybe he blew it off.

11:05.632 --> 11:06.798
[bangs on door]

11:06.833 --> 11:08.733
Doesn't strike me as the kind
of guy who keeps his word.

11:08.769 --> 11:09.601
True.

11:09.636 --> 11:11.903
But Clayton Morrell
is a narcissist.

11:11.938 --> 11:14.439
I can't believe he would miss
the opportunity to soak up

11:14.474 --> 11:16.274
all this public attention.

11:16.309 --> 11:18.176
Something's not right.

11:19.212 --> 11:20.211
Uh oh.

11:23.417 --> 11:24.582
Clayton Morrel.

11:24.618 --> 11:26.885
He looks dead.

11:33.560 --> 11:34.893
Yeah, we knocked on the door.

11:34.928 --> 11:36.428
When no one answered
I looked in the window,

11:36.463 --> 11:38.096
and saw the body.

11:38.131 --> 11:39.864
And that's when we called 911.

11:39.900 --> 11:41.266
And you were here to talk
to the victim

11:41.301 --> 11:43.702
about a restraining order?

11:43.737 --> 11:45.103
I'm going to be here most
of the night

11:45.138 --> 11:46.237
so can you both come down
to the station

11:46.273 --> 11:48.239
and make an official statement
first thing tomorrow?

11:48.275 --> 11:49.374
Of course.

11:49.409 --> 11:51.042
Have you talked
to Walter Faraday?

11:51.078 --> 11:51.910
Who's he?

11:51.945 --> 11:52.744
He's the neighbour
across the street.

11:52.779 --> 11:55.380
He has a one-man
neighbourhood watch.

11:55.415 --> 11:56.748
I've got officers canvassing.

11:56.783 --> 11:57.749
Why is he of interest?

11:57.784 --> 11:59.984
He was the witness in
the Clayton Morrel trial

12:00.020 --> 12:02.120
10 years ago but he never
took the stand.

12:02.155 --> 12:04.589
Paulina was concerned that
his testimony could backfire.

12:04.624 --> 12:06.458
He had a history
of alcohol abuse

12:06.493 --> 12:08.226
and he could have
been discredited.

12:08.261 --> 12:10.628
And you think Mr. Faraday
might have been motivated

12:10.664 --> 12:12.097
to take the law
into his own hands?

12:12.132 --> 12:13.965
I don't know that Walter
is a killer

12:14.000 --> 12:16.267
but he stopped drinking
after the trial

12:16.303 --> 12:19.003
and if anyone saw anything,
he did.

12:19.039 --> 12:20.905
Well I think that everyone
knew something might happen

12:20.941 --> 12:23.842
with Clayton Morrel getting out
of prison after only 10 years

12:23.877 --> 12:25.343
but I don't think that
anyone thought

12:25.378 --> 12:26.745
he'd be the one to end
up dead.

12:26.780 --> 12:27.779
I certainly didn't.

12:27.814 --> 12:29.247
This is going to be big news.

12:29.282 --> 12:30.315
The chief has already called
the mayor

12:30.350 --> 12:32.684
and they want this solved
as quickly as possible.

12:32.719 --> 12:33.785
You found anything yet?

12:33.820 --> 12:36.921
No, no murder weapon so far,
no sign of a break in.

12:36.957 --> 12:37.989
So, someone he knew?

12:38.024 --> 12:39.424
Or someone he let in.

12:39.459 --> 12:41.259
I haven't been able to reach
his wife, Naomi.

12:41.294 --> 12:42.527
Forensics is doing
a full sweep,

12:42.562 --> 12:44.929
so far all we have
is a partial shoe print

12:44.965 --> 12:46.698
that was found by the body.

12:46.733 --> 12:47.699
It's strange that the killer

12:47.734 --> 12:50.435
would leave a shoe print
behind and nothing else.

12:50.470 --> 12:51.836
Well it's pretty clearly
a homicide.

12:51.872 --> 12:52.737
[cell phone dings]

12:52.773 --> 12:53.838
Looks like he was stabbed
several times.

12:53.874 --> 12:55.540
I'll be able to get a better
idea of the exact weapon

12:55.575 --> 12:57.342
once I've done the autopsy.

12:57.377 --> 12:59.677
The District Attorney
just pulled up.

12:59.713 --> 13:00.979
Oh, okay.

13:08.221 --> 13:09.454
[door slams shut]

13:09.489 --> 13:10.889
Is it true? Is he dead?

13:10.924 --> 13:11.656
Yes.

13:11.691 --> 13:12.624
Murdered?

13:12.659 --> 13:13.658
Yes.

13:13.693 --> 13:14.526
Where is he?

13:14.561 --> 13:15.994
Are you here as
the District Attorney?

13:16.029 --> 13:16.995
What else would I be here as?

13:17.030 --> 13:19.664
Someone with unresolved feeling
for the victim?

13:19.699 --> 13:21.499
I don't care for your tone,
Hailey.

13:21.535 --> 13:24.469
Paulina, everyone knows your
history with Clayton Morrel.

13:24.504 --> 13:26.237
You've been very distracted
at the office and some people

13:26.273 --> 13:28.640
might see him and his new book
as the reason why.

13:28.675 --> 13:31.242
This might be one crime scene
you shouldn't be at.

13:31.278 --> 13:32.777
[exhales]

13:35.515 --> 13:36.548
I'll make sure she gets
home okay.

13:36.583 --> 13:37.949
Thanks, Finch.

13:45.292 --> 13:47.592
Cross every "t",
dot every "i".

13:47.627 --> 13:48.526
I hear ya.

13:48.562 --> 13:49.527
It's important.

13:49.563 --> 13:50.562
Gotcha.

13:53.700 --> 13:54.532
[car door closes]

13:54.568 --> 13:56.234
Don't worry.

14:01.875 --> 14:03.908
Okay, I think that'll do it.

14:03.944 --> 14:04.776
Thanks to you both.

14:04.811 --> 14:06.177
Any leads?

14:06.213 --> 14:07.579
No witnesses so far.

14:07.614 --> 14:08.413
That, uh, neighbour
you mentioned,

14:08.448 --> 14:10.515
Walter Faraday,
he hasn't been home.

14:10.550 --> 14:12.784
I've got regular patrols
on the street and forensics

14:12.819 --> 14:14.886
is still in the house so we'll
catch him when he gets back.

14:14.921 --> 14:16.688
What about the wife,
Naomi Morrel?

14:16.723 --> 14:17.922
I haven't spoken to her yet.

14:17.958 --> 14:20.258
Apparently, she was out of town
and is on her way back now.

14:20.293 --> 14:21.526
<i> Hey Monty!</i>

14:21.561 --> 14:22.760
Jonas.

14:22.796 --> 14:23.461
Good timing.

14:23.496 --> 14:25.597
Tell me that you have something.

14:25.632 --> 14:27.732
Time of death was last night
around 8:00 pm

14:27.767 --> 14:29.434
give or take an hour
on either side.

14:29.469 --> 14:30.969
He was stabbed
with what is probably

14:31.004 --> 14:32.237
an ordinary kitchen knife.

14:32.272 --> 14:33.104
A crime of opportunity?

14:33.139 --> 14:33.771
Maybe.

14:33.807 --> 14:34.973
There were six stab wounds.

14:35.008 --> 14:36.975
The first one was to the heart
and would have killed him

14:37.010 --> 14:38.142
almost immediately.

14:38.178 --> 14:41.045
The subsequent five wounds
were inflicted post mortem.

14:41.081 --> 14:41.913
Wow.

14:41.948 --> 14:44.382
That implies both planning
and rage.

14:44.417 --> 14:45.450
Revenge killing?

14:45.485 --> 14:46.784
Quite possibly.

14:46.820 --> 14:48.119
Hey Monty, what about
that partial shoe print

14:48.154 --> 14:49.087
you mentioned?

14:49.122 --> 14:50.154
They're running it now.

14:50.190 --> 14:51.890
As of this moment it is the key
piece of evidence

14:51.925 --> 14:52.891
that we need to tie someone

14:52.926 --> 14:54.959
other than the wife to the scene
of the crime.

14:54.995 --> 14:56.427
You must have a long list
of suspects.

14:56.463 --> 14:58.062
Too long.

14:58.098 --> 15:01.332
Hailey what's your insight given
your history with the victim?

15:01.368 --> 15:04.168
I mean I... I think the early
release of Clayton Morrel

15:04.204 --> 15:06.271
took a lot of people
by surprise.

15:06.306 --> 15:08.306
Now what about Amelia Lincoln?

15:08.341 --> 15:10.775
She admitted to having an
altercation with the victim

15:10.810 --> 15:12.911
and he was convinced
that she was stalking him.

15:12.946 --> 15:14.512
I can't deny the motive.

15:14.547 --> 15:17.282
She was understandably upset
that her sister's killer

15:17.317 --> 15:19.651
was paroled but I don't see her
as a killer.

15:19.686 --> 15:21.653
Maybe the complaint against her
was the last straw.

I get home to find my house
swarming with cops.

15:36.169 --> 15:37.168
I can't even go inside.

15:37.203 --> 15:39.704
And all anyone will say is
you have to talk to

15:39.739 --> 15:41.205
Detective Montgomery.

15:41.241 --> 15:45.109
So, Detective, here I am against
my better judgement.

15:45.145 --> 15:46.678
What is going on?

<i> Mrs. Morrel, I am sorry</i>
<i> for the secrecy</i>

15:49.482 --> 15:51.716
but I wanted to speak to you
in person about your husband.

15:51.751 --> 15:53.851
Whatever it is,
Clayton didn't do it.

15:53.887 --> 15:55.820
I'll go straight to the press
if you don't let him go.

15:55.855 --> 15:58.189
<i> I'm afraid that's not</i>
<i> the issue.</i>

15:58.224 --> 16:02.560
I'm so sorry to tell you, but
your husband has passed away.

16:02.595 --> 16:04.295
He's dead?

16:04.331 --> 16:05.163
How?

16:05.198 --> 16:07.198
We believe he was killed.

Attorney, you name it.

16:21.581 --> 16:23.247
When was the last time you spoke
to your husband?

16:23.283 --> 16:25.717
I don't know, a couple of days.

16:25.752 --> 16:28.152

in Macon.

in Macon.

16:35.061 --> 16:36.861
<i> How long were you gone?</i>

16:36.896 --> 16:38.496
Are you asking me for an alibi?

16:38.531 --> 16:40.932
We just wanna be sure
that we have all the facts.

16:40.967 --> 16:43.101
I left on Thursday
and came back today.

16:43.136 --> 16:45.670
Did your husband mention
any plans that he had

16:45.705 --> 16:47.238
while you were gone?

16:49.476 --> 16:50.908
No.

16:52.645 --> 16:55.480
look a little closer to
your own house than mine.

16:57.217 --> 16:58.182
[car doors slam]

16:58.218 --> 16:59.884
I can't put my finger on it
but Naomi Morrel

16:59.919 --> 17:02.286
definitely wasn't being
completely honest.

17:02.322 --> 17:03.688
You think she knows
who the killer is?

17:03.723 --> 17:04.789
I don't know, maybe,

17:04.824 --> 17:07.258
but I didn't even get the sense
that she was upset.

17:07.293 --> 17:09.527
You know what they say,
people grieve in different ways.

17:09.562 --> 17:12.530
This was more calculating,
like instead of grieving,

17:12.565 --> 17:14.032
she was planning.

17:14.067 --> 17:15.366
That's ominous.

17:15.402 --> 17:16.934
But then again,
who would marry a man

17:16.970 --> 17:18.536
convicted of killing
his first wife?

17:18.571 --> 17:20.138
Maybe she's just
like her husband.

17:20.173 --> 17:22.373
Lacking empathy could explain
her non-reaction

17:22.409 --> 17:24.042
to the news of her
husband's death.

17:24.077 --> 17:25.943
Well, that's scary.

17:25.979 --> 17:27.211
You think maybe she killed him?

17:27.247 --> 17:28.613
Well, Monty talked to her friend
in Macon

17:28.648 --> 17:29.914
who corroborated her alibi.

17:29.949 --> 17:30.948
Yeah, but you don't buy it.

17:30.984 --> 17:31.949
Facts are facts.

17:31.985 --> 17:33.418
All I have is a feeling

17:33.453 --> 17:35.053
that she's not being
completely honest.

17:35.088 --> 17:36.454
Looks like Monty's right.

17:36.489 --> 17:38.523
This case is big news.

17:39.426 --> 17:41.125
The press is just going
to complicate things.

17:41.161 --> 17:42.126
I know.

17:42.162 --> 17:44.162
They're all over the place.

17:44.197 --> 17:45.163
Derek.

17:45.198 --> 17:46.564
Hailey.

17:46.599 --> 17:48.266
Join the good guys?

17:48.301 --> 17:50.501
Hm, I know better than to jump
from one sinking ship

17:50.537 --> 17:51.903
to the next.

17:51.938 --> 17:53.337
How are you holding up?

17:53.373 --> 17:54.338
Holding up?

17:54.374 --> 17:55.673
Oh, with Clayton.

17:55.708 --> 18:01.946
Uh, he was a client, now
he's no longer a client.

18:01.981 --> 18:04.682
But I don't wanna pretend
we were friends

18:04.717 --> 18:06.651
but he didn't deserve to die.

18:06.686 --> 18:09.754
Some would argue,
neither did his first wife.

18:09.789 --> 18:10.788
He did his time.

18:10.824 --> 18:12.290
He deserved a second chance.

18:12.325 --> 18:13.458
Well, I'm sorry for your loss.

18:13.493 --> 18:14.358
No, you aren't.

18:14.394 --> 18:16.461
And if I were you,
I'd be very careful

18:16.496 --> 18:19.330
who I'm seen with
in the coming days.

18:20.733 --> 18:22.233
Mmhmm.

18:23.837 --> 18:26.003
What is that supposed to mean?

18:26.039 --> 18:27.305
Sounded like a threat.

18:27.340 --> 18:29.173
I was thinking the same thing.

18:29.209 --> 18:30.541
I'm gonna go check on Paulina.

18:30.577 --> 18:31.476
Alright.

18:31.511 --> 18:32.944
You know where I'll be
when you're done.

18:38.585 --> 18:40.651
If you're here to see Paulina,
she's really busy today.

18:40.687 --> 18:41.352
Oh, I bet.

18:41.387 --> 18:43.154
I'll just pop in and say hello.

18:43.189 --> 18:44.222
Well, please make it quick.

18:44.257 --> 18:46.624
We really need to get
this office under control.

18:46.659 --> 18:48.860
And now that Clayton Morrel is
no longer such a distraction

18:48.895 --> 18:51.395
maybe things will get back
to normal around here.

18:51.431 --> 18:54.465
You know, Alex, whatever we
thought about Clayton Morrel

18:54.501 --> 18:56.968
he's the victim now
and this office is going

18:57.003 --> 18:58.503
to have to prosecute his killer.

18:58.538 --> 18:59.770
Of course.

18:59.806 --> 19:02.974
In the meantime, we have other
cases that need our attention.

19:05.411 --> 19:08.012
I swear I had this month's case
files organized

19:08.047 --> 19:11.082
and now I can't
find them anywhere.

19:11.117 --> 19:13.050
Maybe you should consider taking
a few days off.

19:13.086 --> 19:14.285
Impossible.

19:14.320 --> 19:18.689
Paulina, I think you need to
deal with what's just happened.

19:18.725 --> 19:20.158
What is there to deal with.

19:20.193 --> 19:21.726
He's dead. It's over.

19:21.761 --> 19:22.593
Paulina.

19:22.629 --> 19:24.228
What is it that you want
to hear Hailey?

19:24.264 --> 19:26.030
That I'm glad that he died?

19:26.065 --> 19:27.498
Part of me is.

19:27.534 --> 19:30.434
Well, relieved is a better word
and a bit sorry

19:30.470 --> 19:33.538
that my mistake at trial is
only fixed because he died.

19:33.573 --> 19:35.907
Why don't we go somewhere
and talk about this?

19:35.942 --> 19:39.177
Hailey, I appreciate
your concern and you know

19:39.212 --> 19:42.213
that I love you but I don't have
time to talk about something

19:42.248 --> 19:44.849
that's already over
and done with.

19:44.884 --> 19:46.117
If you change your mind.

19:46.152 --> 19:47.919
I won't.

19:48.721 --> 19:51.189
I don't know Fincher, I just
really worry about Paulina.

19:51.224 --> 19:52.023
Yeah, she hasn't been
the same

19:52.058 --> 19:53.858
since Clayton Morrel
was released.

19:53.893 --> 19:55.126
Maybe now she can
really move on.

19:55.161 --> 19:56.460
I hope so.

19:56.496 --> 19:58.796
What's this all about?

19:58.831 --> 20:00.398
I'm Naomi Morrel.

20:00.433 --> 20:02.133
Wife of Clayton Morrel.

20:02.168 --> 20:05.036
My husband was brutally murdered
in our home yesterday

20:05.071 --> 20:08.306
and I'm here to tell you
I know who killed him.

20:08.341 --> 20:09.874
She's going to publicly
name Amelia.

20:09.909 --> 20:11.042
This has to be about
the complaint.

20:11.077 --> 20:12.476
This is going to ruin
Amelia's life.

20:12.512 --> 20:13.444
Can we stop it?

20:13.479 --> 20:14.245
I don't think so.

20:14.280 --> 20:16.747
The person who killed
my husband

20:16.783 --> 20:20.451
is the District Attorney of
Atlanta, Paulina D'Orazio.

Monty said her phone has been
ringing off the hook.

20:33.366 --> 20:36.334
This isn't going to make solving
this case any easier.

20:36.369 --> 20:38.669
Why would Naomi
go to the press?

20:38.705 --> 20:40.905
She doesn't trust the police.

20:40.940 --> 20:43.341
But she must not realize the
consequences of going public

20:43.376 --> 20:46.110
with an unsubstantiated claim
like that.

20:46.145 --> 20:48.179
Unless she does.

20:48.214 --> 20:52.216
Mrs. Morrel, I understand
how you must be feeling.

20:52.252 --> 20:54.285
You mean that I went away
for a few days and came back

20:54.320 --> 20:55.419
to find my husband murdered

20:55.455 --> 20:58.723
and the cops oblivious to
the most obvious suspect.

20:58.758 --> 21:00.858
I assure you we are doing
everything that we can

21:00.893 --> 21:02.393
to bring his killer
to justice.

21:02.428 --> 21:05.529
I told you to look inside
your own house.

<i> It's been less than 48 hours.</i>

21:09.602 --> 21:13.971
These investigations need time
and they need confidentiality

21:14.007 --> 21:15.940
and I have to ask you
for your patience.

21:15.975 --> 21:19.277
While you conspire to cover
it up, you mean?

21:19.312 --> 21:21.646
I hope you understand
how damaging your comments

21:21.681 --> 21:22.613
will be to this investigation.

21:22.649 --> 21:24.649
Because you honestly
would have investigated

21:24.684 --> 21:27.785
the District Attorney if I
didn't say anything publicly?

21:27.820 --> 21:30.554

Forgive me if I don't
believe you.

21:34.694 --> 21:37.762
Can you tell me why you
think Miss D'Orazio

21:37.797 --> 21:38.896
<i> killed your husband?</i>

21:38.931 --> 21:41.299
Because Clayton
said that she would.

21:41.334 --> 21:42.800
<i> Why did he say that?</i>

21:43.436 --> 21:45.369
[rewinds tape]

21:45.938 --> 21:48.506
Because Clayton said
that she would.

21:48.541 --> 21:49.940
<i> Why did he say that?</i>

21:49.976 --> 21:52.643
Because he knew
something obviously.

21:52.679 --> 21:55.479
Clayton said if anything
were to ever happen to him,

21:55.515 --> 21:59.750
look first at Paulina and
the proof would be in his book.

22:07.393 --> 22:09.994
Did Paulina threaten Clayton?

22:10.029 --> 22:11.696
Not that I ever saw
and even if she did

22:11.731 --> 22:13.364
it's hardly proof of murder

22:13.399 --> 22:15.099
especially coming from someone
like Paulina.

22:15.134 --> 22:17.101
Fincher you weren't with her.
Is it possible?

22:17.136 --> 22:19.870
No. I mean she hasn't been
herself since Clayton Morrel

22:19.906 --> 22:21.772
got out of jail
but who would be?

22:21.808 --> 22:23.441
I called the publisher.

22:23.476 --> 22:25.876
Mr. Morrel wrote this book
while he was incarcerated

22:25.912 --> 22:27.078
which can only mean that

22:27.113 --> 22:30.114
whatever proof he put in here
existed before he got out.

22:30.149 --> 22:31.649
It would have to be
from 10 years ago.

22:31.684 --> 22:33.284
I was at that trial and
the contact between them

22:33.319 --> 22:34.652
was never one on one.

22:34.687 --> 22:36.787
Did Paulina visit him
in prison?

22:36.823 --> 22:38.689
Not that I know of.

22:39.325 --> 22:41.726
They've asked me to take
some time off from work.

22:41.761 --> 22:43.060
Can you believe it?

22:43.096 --> 22:44.295
I can actually.

22:44.330 --> 22:45.363
Hm.

22:45.398 --> 22:46.731
Well, I will be there tomorrow.

22:46.766 --> 22:48.966
I have a civic duty
and I'm not going to let

22:49.001 --> 22:51.902
some slanderous nonsense
keep me from doing it.

22:51.938 --> 22:53.003
Good.

22:53.039 --> 22:56.140
You know I think you're the only
one sticking by me.

22:56.175 --> 22:58.209
It's amazing how a whiff
of scandal

22:58.244 --> 23:00.845
and supposed friends
just go running.

23:00.880 --> 23:03.647
Do you know what Naomi
was talking about?

23:03.683 --> 23:05.015
No.

23:05.051 --> 23:07.818
I never read that trash
he published.

23:07.854 --> 23:09.720
I'm sure he just painted me
as the bad guy

23:09.756 --> 23:12.556
to make himself look
more sympathetic.

23:12.592 --> 23:15.760
And there's nothing else?

23:15.795 --> 23:17.728
Not at all.

23:18.598 --> 23:20.231
Alright.

23:27.273 --> 23:28.406
<i> Did you find anything</i>
<i> in the book?</i>

23:28.441 --> 23:29.673
No.

23:29.709 --> 23:31.742
I put a call into the publisher
to see if anything was left out.

23:31.778 --> 23:33.544
If it was libellous,
it might have been cut.

23:33.579 --> 23:36.080
Let me guess, they referred
you to their legal team.

23:36.115 --> 23:37.381
Of course.

23:37.417 --> 23:39.517
And they weren't much help.

23:39.552 --> 23:41.519
I might have a way
of finding out.

23:45.958 --> 23:47.858
Selling like hotcakes?

23:47.894 --> 23:49.693
I can barely keep it stocked.

23:49.729 --> 23:51.061
Would you like a copy this time?

23:51.097 --> 23:52.963
No. I came to talk to you.

23:52.999 --> 23:54.565
Oh. How can I help?

23:54.600 --> 23:57.101
Naomi is under the impression
that her husband

23:57.136 --> 23:59.470
names his murderer in there.

23:59.505 --> 24:01.105
Oh, you're talking about
the District Attorney

24:01.140 --> 24:02.606
visiting Clayton in prison?

24:02.642 --> 24:03.774
She visited him?

24:03.810 --> 24:05.609
Right before his parole hearing.

24:05.645 --> 24:08.646
Apparently, Ms. D'Orazio told
Clayton that if he got parole,

24:08.681 --> 24:12.583
she'd see to it that he wished
he was still safe on the inside.

24:12.618 --> 24:13.551
Are you sure?

24:13.586 --> 24:14.685
That's what Clayton told me.

24:14.720 --> 24:16.954
And the publisher wasn't going
to put it in the book.

24:16.989 --> 24:19.590
They said it was libel and
they didn't want to get sued.

24:19.625 --> 24:21.125
They were right.

24:21.160 --> 24:22.927
Now it's hearsay.

24:22.962 --> 24:24.562
Clayton knew who wanted
to kill him,

24:24.597 --> 24:26.530
he was trying to
protect himself.

24:27.867 --> 24:30.801
But the law was never
on his side, was it?

24:32.839 --> 24:35.072
I verified with the prison
that you did indeed visit

24:35.107 --> 24:37.575
Clayton Morrel the day
before his parole hearing.

24:37.610 --> 24:38.476
Yes.

24:38.511 --> 24:40.277
What did you say to him?

24:40.313 --> 24:42.513
I told him the world
didn't want him back.

24:42.548 --> 24:43.681
I didn't threaten him.

24:43.716 --> 24:44.915
I just told him the truth.

24:44.951 --> 24:47.818
You shouldn't have gone alone;
I would have gone with you.

24:47.854 --> 24:49.487
It was something I wanted
to do on my own.

24:49.522 --> 24:51.689
But now there's no witness
to what was said.

24:51.724 --> 24:54.191
And the publisher has Clayton
Morrel's original first draft

24:54.227 --> 24:55.993
where he describes your visit
to the prison

24:56.028 --> 24:58.128
and the direct threat
you made against his life.

24:58.164 --> 24:59.697
Which is now in evidence.

24:59.732 --> 25:00.998
It's hearsay.

25:01.033 --> 25:02.500
It'll never stand up in court.

25:02.535 --> 25:04.335
But if the press
gets wind of it.

25:04.370 --> 25:05.803
Well luckily,
I'm not being tried

25:05.838 --> 25:07.638
by the court of
public opinion.

25:07.673 --> 25:10.107
And I assume, Detective, you're
still following the evidence

25:10.142 --> 25:11.842
and pursuing legitimate
suspects?

25:11.878 --> 25:13.344
Of course.

25:13.379 --> 25:16.447
Well, if you don't mind.

25:16.482 --> 25:17.581
Paulina's right.

25:17.617 --> 25:20.551
I can't waste more time
following up on Naomi's grudges.

25:20.586 --> 25:22.786
I'm on my way to talk
to Amelia Lincoln.

25:22.822 --> 25:24.522
I know she's the most
likely suspect,

25:24.557 --> 25:26.690
but I really hope
it isn't her.

34:10.215 --> 34:11.782
than I would have expected.

34:11.817 --> 34:13.116
What do you mean?

34:13.152 --> 34:14.851
Well, look at the body language.

34:14.887 --> 34:17.854
She's leaning in,
intimidating him.

34:17.890 --> 34:18.855
Yeah, I see.

34:18.891 --> 34:20.624
Clayton is shrinking away.

34:20.659 --> 34:21.625
Submissive.

34:21.660 --> 34:23.927
She was definitely the aggressor
in this fight.

34:23.962 --> 34:26.229
I wonder if she was the
aggressor in the relationship.

34:26.265 --> 34:28.065
Yeah, but Naomi was in Macon.

34:28.100 --> 34:31.701
Or she was gone, then came back,
then was gone again.

34:31.737 --> 34:33.637
It's only an hour and a half
on a bad day.

34:33.672 --> 34:35.472
Let me call the Macon police
and see if they can get

34:35.507 --> 34:39.976
a more detailed itinerary
out of Naomi's friend.

34:40.012 --> 34:41.578
Get me Macon police.

34:42.181 --> 34:46.216
♪

34:50.589 --> 34:52.489
I didn't think you had
any clients today.

34:52.524 --> 34:55.559
I just had to get my mind off
the whole Clayton Morrel thing.

34:55.594 --> 34:56.760
You wanna talk?

34:56.795 --> 34:58.662
I don't know, Sabrina, how do
I know when I'm listening

34:58.697 --> 35:01.431
to my bias instead
of the truth?

35:01.467 --> 35:03.433
Well, you don't.

35:03.469 --> 35:05.936
But instincts have a way
of circumventing emotions.

35:05.971 --> 35:07.737
So, you can frame them
any way you want to

35:07.773 --> 35:09.106
but until you resolve the truth

35:09.141 --> 35:12.075
of what your instincts are
telling you, they won't
leave you alone.

35:12.111 --> 35:13.276
I know it's true.

35:13.312 --> 35:15.779
I just worry that I've been
fooled by friendship before.

35:15.814 --> 35:18.949
All the more reason why
it wouldn't happen again.

35:30.295 --> 35:31.294
Yes.

35:34.500 --> 35:35.365
What are you doing here?

35:35.400 --> 35:37.267
Consulting.

35:37.302 --> 35:39.503
I hope you're not trying to
influence the investigation.

35:39.538 --> 35:42.706
I'm just here to observe
and consult when asked.

35:42.741 --> 35:45.742
I don't bend the law
to suit anyone.

35:50.582 --> 35:52.215
What was that all about?

35:52.251 --> 35:54.384
Old wounds run deep,
I expect.

35:54.419 --> 35:56.453
Wasn't that Clayton Morrel's
lawyer?

35:56.488 --> 35:57.854
And lost the trial to Paulina.

35:57.890 --> 35:59.022
Yup.

35:59.057 --> 36:01.825
Well then, I suppose he'll
be here to represent Naomi.

36:01.860 --> 36:04.661
My guess is he won't
let her say a word.

36:06.698 --> 36:08.565
Can you verify your whereabouts

36:08.600 --> 36:10.167
the night that Clayton Morrel
was killed?

36:10.202 --> 36:12.402
My client has already given you
that information.

36:12.437 --> 36:14.371
We have since received
a witness statement

36:14.406 --> 36:17.374
claiming that he saw Mrs. Morrel
enter her house

36:17.409 --> 36:18.708
the day her husband died.

36:18.744 --> 36:21.244
Which witness is more credible?

36:21.280 --> 36:25.315
Uh, a friend, with no ties
to my client's husband

36:25.350 --> 36:28.318
or the drunk from across
the street

36:28.353 --> 36:29.986
<i> with the chip</i>
<i> on his shoulder.</i>

36:30.022 --> 36:32.389
Mrs. Morrel's friend in Macon
has been questioned

36:32.424 --> 36:34.424
by the local police
and is unable to account

36:34.459 --> 36:37.827
for Mrs. Morrel's whereabouts
between noon and 10:00 p.m.

36:37.863 --> 36:38.795
the night her husband
was killed.

36:38.830 --> 36:41.731
My client has nothing to say
at this time.

36:41.767 --> 36:42.766
<i> Was your marriage happy?</i>

36:42.801 --> 36:43.833
<i> Don't answer that.</i>

36:43.869 --> 36:45.702
We have evidence that you
and your husband argued

36:45.737 --> 36:47.904
in the days leading up
to his death.

36:47.940 --> 36:49.039
Can you tell me what about?

36:49.074 --> 36:50.106
Don't answer that either.

36:50.142 --> 36:52.042
This is a fishing expedition.

36:52.077 --> 36:54.911
Unless you have hard evidence
linking my client to the death

36:54.947 --> 36:57.380
of her husband she has nothing
more to tell you.

36:57.416 --> 37:00.016
Are you sure that your client
doesn't want to explain

37:00.052 --> 37:02.519
why she lied about her alibi?

37:02.554 --> 37:05.522
What were you doing between
noon and 10:00 p.m.?

37:05.557 --> 37:07.424
You already know who's guilty.

37:07.459 --> 37:10.026
This is all a waste
of everyone's time.

37:10.062 --> 37:11.528
No not everyone's.

37:11.563 --> 37:13.597
You get paid by the hour
after all.

37:13.632 --> 37:15.565
Ha.

37:15.601 --> 37:17.701
We're done here.

37:17.736 --> 37:19.002
Naomi.

37:25.244 --> 37:26.610
Well, that didn't turn out
the way I'd hoped.

37:26.645 --> 37:27.844
Not the only time she wanted
to say something

37:27.879 --> 37:30.313
was about her friend blowing her
alibi and then her reaction

37:30.349 --> 37:32.282
was more annoyed
than anything else.

37:32.317 --> 37:34.084
Clayton Morrel didn't have
any real assets.

37:34.119 --> 37:35.986
He owned the house
and the contents,

37:36.021 --> 37:38.088
and he had some money
but nothing that Naomi

37:38.123 --> 37:40.657
didn't already have access to.

37:40.692 --> 37:43.093
Whatever the reason she came
back to the house that day

37:43.128 --> 37:44.828
is what she doesn't want us
to know.

37:44.863 --> 37:47.564
And as it stands,
we may never find out.

37:47.599 --> 37:50.133
I'll get a warrant for the phone
and the car GPS.

37:50.168 --> 37:51.801
Derek won't give you access
without one?

37:51.837 --> 37:53.603
[message alert]

37:53.639 --> 37:56.239
Oh, that's the lab back with
the analysis of the shoe print

37:56.275 --> 37:57.807
found at the scene.

37:57.843 --> 38:00.844
It's from a unisex sneaker
but there was too little of it

38:00.879 --> 38:02.112
to determine a size.

38:02.147 --> 38:03.313
Maybe Naomi's.

38:03.348 --> 38:06.283
There's no shoe like it at
the house or anywhere nearby.

38:06.318 --> 38:08.184
I'll see if I can get a warrant
for Naomi's car.

38:08.220 --> 38:10.020
You know this could take Paulina
off the table.

38:10.055 --> 38:12.322
I've never seen her wear
a sneaker in my life.

38:12.357 --> 38:14.157
Well, if she'll submit
to a voluntary search

38:14.192 --> 38:16.192
it would go a long way
in clearing her name.

38:16.228 --> 38:17.494
I bet she would.

38:21.967 --> 38:23.166
Whatcha doin' here?

38:23.201 --> 38:24.901
Oh, I just stopped by to see
Paulina on my way to the office

38:24.936 --> 38:26.403
and you know I never turn down
a free coffee.

38:26.438 --> 38:27.003
Mmhmm.

38:27.039 --> 38:28.171
I know that.

38:28.206 --> 38:29.205
And while I have you here,

38:29.241 --> 38:31.808
if I want to do something
special with Meghan

38:31.843 --> 38:33.410
you know, like for a date,

38:33.445 --> 38:35.512
should I wear regular clothes
or a suit?

38:35.547 --> 38:37.080
You would voluntarily wear
a suit?

38:37.115 --> 38:38.748
It's been known to happen.

38:38.784 --> 38:39.716
So, what's your preference?

38:39.751 --> 38:42.118
Well, I don't think
my preference is really

38:42.154 --> 38:43.753
what you're looking
for but I would say that

38:43.789 --> 38:46.356
you should probably dress
at the same level as Meghan.

38:46.391 --> 38:47.757
Does that help?

38:47.793 --> 38:49.125
Maybe.

38:49.161 --> 38:50.593
What is this special date?

38:50.629 --> 38:51.995
I'm dying of curiosity.

38:52.030 --> 38:53.496
You don't need to know
everything about my life.

38:53.532 --> 38:54.998
No you don't need
to tell me everything

38:55.033 --> 38:56.333
but somehow you always do.

38:56.368 --> 38:57.300
[laughs]

38:57.336 --> 38:59.869
Maybe I should stop
telling you everything.

38:59.905 --> 39:01.338
Well, that's just mean.

39:05.744 --> 39:07.177
Oh no.

39:08.313 --> 39:09.546
Paulina, it's going to be fine.

39:09.581 --> 39:12.015
Don't say anything.

39:15.087 --> 39:15.952
I thought this was over.

39:15.987 --> 39:19.956
I thought so too
but then we found this.

39:19.991 --> 39:20.957
Is that?

39:20.992 --> 39:22.659
Murder weapon.

39:22.694 --> 39:24.627
It was in Paulina's car.

39:31.370 --> 39:34.170
No DNA evidence other than
the blood and no fingerprints

39:34.206 --> 39:37.707
found on the hilt of the knife
that you found in Paulina's car.

39:37.743 --> 39:40.410
But the blood is a match
to Clayton Morrel

39:40.445 --> 39:43.546
and the knife is a match to
the wounds that killed him.

39:43.582 --> 39:45.215
I don't know what to say,
Hailey.

39:45.250 --> 39:47.250
Monty, you can't believe
all this.

39:47.285 --> 39:48.852
It's not about what I believe.

39:48.887 --> 39:49.719
It's about the evidence.

39:49.755 --> 39:50.587
Why would Paulina
submit to a search

39:50.622 --> 39:52.255
if she knew the knife
was in her car?

39:52.290 --> 39:53.390
She would have moved it.

39:53.425 --> 39:55.091
It's one of the questions
that I'm going to ask her.

39:55.127 --> 39:56.693
Well, somebody planted
it there.

39:56.728 --> 39:57.961
They're trying to frame Paulina.

39:57.996 --> 40:01.398
I'm not ruling that out but I
can't rule out Paulina either.

40:01.433 --> 40:03.066
Has she been charged?

40:03.101 --> 40:04.367
Not yet.

40:06.638 --> 40:07.504
Hailey.

40:07.539 --> 40:08.338
Paulina, listen to me.

40:08.373 --> 40:09.739
Say nothing.

40:09.775 --> 40:11.741
I have nothing to hide.

40:14.112 --> 40:15.945
Alex, thank goodness.

40:15.981 --> 40:17.347
You can get me out of here.

40:17.382 --> 40:18.581
Hailey, you can't be here.

40:18.617 --> 40:19.549
You're a civilian.

40:19.584 --> 40:21.084
I'm consulting on this case.

40:21.119 --> 40:23.052
Well in that case you should
stay to hear this.

40:23.088 --> 40:23.853
Hear what?

40:23.889 --> 40:24.988
Out of courtesy
for your position,

40:25.023 --> 40:28.124
the DA's office will be pursuing
a charge against you:

40:28.160 --> 40:30.093
of murder in
the first degree.

40:30.128 --> 40:35.231
♪

40:35.967 --> 40:37.300
This is a nightmare.

40:37.335 --> 40:39.536
My job is stripped,
my reputation is ruined,

40:39.571 --> 40:40.537
no one believes me.

40:40.572 --> 40:41.504
I believe you.

40:41.540 --> 40:44.274
And if you want, I will happily
represent you.

40:44.309 --> 40:45.975
I don't want to drag you
down with me.

40:46.011 --> 40:48.645
Then I will find you the best
defence attorney in Atlanta.

40:48.680 --> 40:49.779
I don't think it will matter.

40:49.815 --> 40:52.549
I don't think there's any coming
back from this Hailey.

40:52.584 --> 40:53.416
Can you think of anyone

40:53.452 --> 40:55.051
who would want to frame
you for murder?

40:55.086 --> 40:56.719
[sighs]

40:56.755 --> 40:58.988
I've been a prosecutor
a long time.

40:59.024 --> 41:03.660
You know we make enemies.

41:03.695 --> 41:05.929
Someone's out to get me,
Hailey.

41:05.964 --> 41:08.798
I know how bad this is.

41:08.834 --> 41:11.401
I'm going to get you
out of this.

41:16.041 --> 41:18.341
I'm not surprised that Alex
was named acting DA

41:18.376 --> 41:21.144
but I am surprised he turned
on Paulina so quickly.

41:21.179 --> 41:22.278
Thanks.

41:22.314 --> 41:23.646
Well it's no secret that
he's planning to run for DA

41:23.682 --> 41:24.614
the next election.

41:24.649 --> 41:26.683
I knew he was ambitious
but I never pegged him

41:26.718 --> 41:29.285
as ruthless and he was always
loyal to Paulina.

41:29.321 --> 41:31.621
I tell ya he's only loyal
to himself.

41:31.656 --> 41:34.457
But would he kill Clayton
Morrel just to frame Paulina?

41:34.493 --> 41:35.692
That is a bit farfetched.

41:35.727 --> 41:37.627
There's easier ways
to discredit her.

41:37.662 --> 41:39.095
Maybe he's just
an opportunist.

41:39.130 --> 41:40.163
How so?

41:40.198 --> 41:42.265
Remember that Derek was
at the DA's office the day

41:42.300 --> 41:43.800
of the murder?

41:43.835 --> 41:45.835
You're thinking that Derek
gave Alex the murder weapon

41:45.871 --> 41:47.036
to plant in Paulina's car?

41:47.072 --> 41:49.305
So, then you're saying that
Derek killed Clayton Morrel?

41:49.341 --> 41:50.673
Why frame Paulina?

41:50.709 --> 41:51.641
I don't know.

41:51.676 --> 41:52.709
What are you thinking?

41:52.744 --> 41:56.012
I'm thinking, somebody
wanted Clayton Morrel gone,

41:56.047 --> 41:59.649
and Paulina was
the best scapegoat.

41:59.684 --> 42:01.484
Amelia Lincoln?

42:01.520 --> 42:04.320
In one fell swoop, she would
avenge her sister's murder,

42:04.356 --> 42:06.556
and framed the person that she
blamed for his early release.

42:06.591 --> 42:09.225
But she has an alibi for
the night of the murder.

42:09.261 --> 42:11.127
True.

42:11.162 --> 42:13.463
What about the wife, Naomi.

42:13.498 --> 42:15.632
No alibi, potential motive.

42:15.667 --> 42:17.400
No clear evidence
of the actual crime,

42:17.435 --> 42:21.170
though her DNA is all over the
house because she lived there.

42:21.206 --> 42:24.807
A whole lot of suspects but
nobody actually fits the crime.

42:24.843 --> 42:26.376
No one except Paulina.

42:26.411 --> 42:28.244
No.

42:28.280 --> 42:29.579
I know how it looks.

42:29.614 --> 42:31.681
But no.

42:31.716 --> 42:35.752
You know what, maybe you were
onto something earlier.

42:35.787 --> 42:37.754
Derek does not come off
very well in this book.

42:37.789 --> 42:38.855
If I were him,

42:38.890 --> 42:41.357
I wouldn't want to be anywhere
near Clayton Morrel.

42:41.393 --> 42:43.192
It's strange, isn't it.

42:43.228 --> 42:45.161
So was his reaction,
come to think of it.

42:45.196 --> 42:46.296
Reaction to what?

42:46.331 --> 42:48.865
Monty made a comment about
him being paid by the hour

42:48.900 --> 42:51.601
and his reaction made me think
that she had hit a sore spot.

42:51.636 --> 42:55.204
Well his career did take a hit
after losing the trial.

42:55.240 --> 42:57.574
Let me dig into him
and see what I can find.

42:57.609 --> 43:00.076
Listen to this.

43:00.111 --> 43:02.612
"I met Tamara my first year
in university.

43:02.647 --> 43:05.281
"She glowed with a lightness
of spirit that felt like a bomb

43:05.317 --> 43:07.617
"to my darkness."

43:07.652 --> 43:09.452
Yo, I don't know Clayton Morrel
very well

43:09.487 --> 43:10.620
but does that sound like him?

43:10.655 --> 43:12.889
No, it doesn't.

43:12.924 --> 43:14.357
Maybe somebody else wrote this.

43:14.392 --> 43:16.960
Met Tamara first year
of university.

43:16.995 --> 43:19.629
Not freshman year
of college.

43:19.664 --> 43:21.731
I think it was written
by someone else.

43:21.766 --> 43:24.300
And I think I know who.

43:24.336 --> 43:26.703
You could tell it
wasn't Clayton?

43:26.738 --> 43:28.972
It just isn't his voice.

43:29.007 --> 43:33.876
It's a bit too cerebral.

43:33.912 --> 43:36.212
Did you write the book?

43:36.247 --> 43:37.747
I'm not supposed to say.

43:37.782 --> 43:39.382
Is it contractual?

43:39.417 --> 43:42.285
A ghostwriter doesn't always
have to keep it quiet.

43:42.320 --> 43:44.387
And in your case the publisher
wanted to sell

43:44.422 --> 43:47.323
the myth of Clayton Morrel,
intellectual.

43:47.359 --> 43:49.993
I won't ask you anything
you can't answer.

43:50.028 --> 43:53.496
Do ghostwriters make royalties?

43:53.531 --> 43:56.099
Ghostwriters get a flat fee,
no other percentage.

43:56.134 --> 43:58.334
So there is no benefit
in staging a stunt

43:58.370 --> 44:02.271
to sell more books, if that's
what you're asking.

44:02.307 --> 44:03.473
Was it that obvious?

44:03.508 --> 44:04.507
It's alright.

44:04.542 --> 44:06.142
I understand.

44:06.177 --> 44:07.944
I... I know you're friends
with the District Attorney

44:07.979 --> 44:09.812
and you believe her when
she says she's innocent.

44:09.848 --> 44:11.614
Just like you believed
your friend.

44:11.650 --> 44:14.017
I couldn't not believe him.

44:14.052 --> 44:17.453
Tamara was my friend as well.

44:17.489 --> 44:21.758
She, Clayton and I spent
a lot of time together.

44:21.793 --> 44:23.092
And whatever people
think about him,

44:23.128 --> 44:25.294
I knew him better.

44:25.330 --> 44:27.196
I do miss him.

44:27.232 --> 44:29.432
I miss them both.

44:29.467 --> 44:32.268
I'm sorry for your loss.

44:32.303 --> 44:34.170
That's kind of you to say.

44:40.378 --> 44:42.445
Hey how's Amelia doing?

44:42.480 --> 44:44.514
I've been meaning to check in
with her.

44:44.549 --> 44:47.984
She cancelled her,
our treatment.

44:48.019 --> 44:50.319
Don't you mean she cancelled
her appointment?

44:50.355 --> 44:51.187
No.

44:51.222 --> 44:51.988
Her whole treatment.

44:52.023 --> 44:54.624
She said her problems
are over.

44:54.659 --> 44:56.993
I tried to get her to come
in anyway but she refused.

44:57.028 --> 44:58.127
Well, that's worrisome.

44:58.163 --> 44:59.128
I agree.

44:59.164 --> 45:00.129
I don't wanna push her

45:00.165 --> 45:01.330
but I feel like the death
of Clayton Morrel

45:01.366 --> 45:04.500
isn't something that she's
equipped to handle on her own.

45:04.536 --> 45:06.803
Maybe I'll stop by her school
on my way home.

45:06.838 --> 45:08.604
Thanks Hailey.

45:14.412 --> 45:15.578
Keep goin' over there.

45:15.613 --> 45:17.547
Hustle up you guys.

45:17.582 --> 45:20.483
Alright you're doing great guys,
go for it.

45:20.518 --> 45:21.718
<i> Okay.</i>

45:23.354 --> 45:25.755
Hailey, what are you doing here?

45:25.790 --> 45:29.559
I came to say hi, it's been
a crazy couple of days.

45:29.594 --> 45:30.560
And Sabrina told me

45:30.595 --> 45:32.895
that you cancelled
your appointment with her.

45:32.931 --> 45:33.996
Oh, it's nothing personal,

45:34.032 --> 45:37.400
I... I like Sabrina, I just
don't need her anymore.

45:37.435 --> 45:39.569
You sound so certain.

45:39.604 --> 45:40.903
He's dead, Hailey.

45:40.939 --> 45:44.540
And I realized my anger died
with him.

45:44.576 --> 45:48.177
Well, I can't speak
for your feelings

45:48.213 --> 45:50.747
but my guess is they're a little
more complicated than that.

45:50.782 --> 45:53.249
No, they aren't.

45:53.284 --> 45:54.383
I'm cured.

45:54.419 --> 45:56.018
Well that's great.

45:56.054 --> 45:57.887
Although I think Sabrina
would sleep better at night

45:57.922 --> 45:59.622
if she could see that
for herself.

45:59.657 --> 46:00.890
She's worried about me?

46:00.925 --> 46:02.625
You've been going through a lot.

46:02.660 --> 46:04.360
She'd wanna make sure
you're okay.

46:04.395 --> 46:05.228
I didn't realize.

46:05.263 --> 46:06.262
I'll drop by.

46:06.297 --> 46:07.463
Okay.

46:07.499 --> 46:09.432
I will uh, set up an appointment
for you just to make sure

46:09.467 --> 46:10.800
that she's available.

46:10.835 --> 46:11.701
Alright.

46:11.736 --> 46:14.170
Thanks Hailey.

46:15.607 --> 46:18.241
<i> Yeah, oh, oh way to catch it.</i>

46:18.276 --> 46:19.709
Okay pick it up.
Let's do it.

46:19.744 --> 46:21.577
<i> There we go.</i>

46:27.118 --> 46:28.718
Hello beautiful.

46:28.753 --> 46:29.719
<i> Where are you?</i>

46:29.754 --> 46:30.620
I'm at work.

46:30.655 --> 46:31.587
Why? Where are you?

46:31.623 --> 46:33.256
I'm at the restaurant
for our anniversary.

46:33.291 --> 46:35.124
That's not tonight.

46:35.160 --> 46:36.726
Not again.

46:36.761 --> 46:38.761
After the first time we met,
the first date ended

46:38.797 --> 46:40.630
with our first kiss
at Chesley's.

46:40.665 --> 46:42.198
<i> Why what did you think</i>
<i> our first date was?</i>

46:42.233 --> 46:44.300
Philly cheesesteaks,
remember?

46:44.335 --> 46:45.301
Oh, sure.

46:45.336 --> 46:47.937
But you were really giving off
a friends vibe.

46:47.972 --> 46:49.572
What because I didn't kiss you?

46:49.607 --> 46:52.141
I didn't realize a date had
to be defined by a kiss.

46:52.177 --> 46:55.812
No, but that kiss was
the first time

46:55.847 --> 46:57.747
I knew you were interested
in me.

46:57.782 --> 47:00.583
Before then I was only
desperately hoping.

47:00.618 --> 47:01.918
<i> I was interested</i>
<i> in you long before that</i>

47:01.953 --> 47:04.887
but I can accept that.

47:04.923 --> 47:05.822
I guess it's
the first moment

47:05.857 --> 47:08.057
I realized you were interested
in me too.

47:08.092 --> 47:09.125
<i> Oh, do you wanna wait?</i>

47:09.160 --> 47:11.127
I can try to finish up here
and get over to you?

47:11.162 --> 47:12.361
No, no.

47:12.397 --> 47:15.298
I wanna do this properly so the
anniversary of our first date,

47:15.333 --> 47:17.967
our first kiss and the beginning
of our relationship

47:18.002 --> 47:20.570
will hereby be celebrated
in two days' time.

47:20.605 --> 47:22.071
<i> At Chesley's.</i>

47:22.106 --> 47:24.040
I will put it in my calendar.

Oh, Fincher don't start.

47:56.808 --> 47:58.708
Whoever did this wasn't trying
to kill me,

47:58.743 --> 48:00.176
they just wanted to scare
me off.

48:00.211 --> 48:02.178
Well they succeeded
in scaring me.

48:02.213 --> 48:03.246
Did Monty find anything
on the knife?

48:03.281 --> 48:06.182
No fingerprints and it wasn't
from the same set

48:06.217 --> 48:07.884
as the knife that killed
Clayton Morrel.

48:07.919 --> 48:11.621
Monty is working on getting
video surveillance.

48:11.656 --> 48:13.322
And I did not see
the licence plate.

48:13.358 --> 48:14.357
What did you see?

48:14.392 --> 48:16.225
I was blinded by the high beams.

48:16.261 --> 48:18.961
I saw a black SUV,
that's it.

48:18.997 --> 48:22.598
Ugh, this whole thing
has my stomach in knots.

48:26.337 --> 48:27.470
What's going on over there?

48:27.505 --> 48:29.171
Alex is moving
into Paulina's office.

48:29.207 --> 48:30.840
Well he didn't waste
any time.

48:30.875 --> 48:32.475
Mmhmm.

48:34.078 --> 48:36.712
I can carry this one myself.

48:40.018 --> 48:41.417
Where is Paulina's assistant?

48:41.452 --> 48:43.686
Oh, Alex fired him.

48:44.856 --> 48:47.657
Are you still friendly
with maintenance?

48:47.692 --> 48:49.425
Hailey, I could lose my job.

48:49.460 --> 48:52.028
I'm sorry, no you're right,
I... forget I said anything.

48:52.063 --> 48:54.163
But I don't know if I want
to keep working

48:54.198 --> 48:57.566
at a place that's so quick
to turn on one of its own.

48:57.602 --> 48:59.335
Gonna make a call here.

49:00.438 --> 49:02.505
Hey it's Finch.

up my cheesesteak for this.

What're we looking
for again?

49:22.026 --> 49:23.926
Uh, that box that Alex
wouldn't let anyone else hold.

49:23.962 --> 49:25.428
It had yellow tape. Look.

49:25.463 --> 49:27.296

he was always very tidy.

49:39.577 --> 49:41.310
These look like they're
from different cases,

49:41.346 --> 49:42.378
these are important documents.

49:42.413 --> 49:46.215
This is a witness statement
from a Thomas Floyd.

49:46.250 --> 49:47.850
Thomas Floyd?

49:47.885 --> 49:49.719
This has been missing
for weeks.

49:49.754 --> 49:52.054
Went missing before it was ever
uploaded to the main server.

49:52.090 --> 49:56.192
Here is a witness statement
for an armed robbery.

49:56.227 --> 49:57.326
And the hard drive to match.

49:57.362 --> 49:59.962
This must be the full file
on this the armed robbery.

49:59.998 --> 50:02.798
This explains how it managed to
disappear off the main frame.

50:02.834 --> 50:05.568
Hailey, these are the missing
case files.

50:05.603 --> 50:07.303
The ones that Paulina
was being blamed for.

50:07.338 --> 50:08.537
Alex was hiding them
from her,

50:08.573 --> 50:10.206
and he was trying
to get her fired.

50:10.241 --> 50:11.040
And when then didn't work--

Be happy to show them these.

What do you want?

50:26.858 --> 50:27.923
The truth?

50:27.959 --> 50:29.191
You were sabotaging Paulina.

50:29.227 --> 50:30.860
She sabotaged herself.

50:30.895 --> 50:33.262
Going to the prison after
Clayton Morrel was released.

50:33.297 --> 50:35.164
Obsessively tracking
his every move.

50:35.199 --> 50:37.767
Constantly asking me if there
were any reports about him.

50:37.802 --> 50:39.535
So instead of helping her
with her issues,

50:39.570 --> 50:41.203
you thought you'd do this?

50:41.239 --> 50:43.039
I misplaced a few files,
it's hardly a crime.

50:43.074 --> 50:44.874
Framing her for murder is.

50:44.909 --> 50:45.841
What are you talking about?

50:45.877 --> 50:47.009
Why was Derek Robinson here

50:47.045 --> 50:49.912

was killed?

No.

50:54.085 --> 50:56.218
Alex, you're next in line,
you have motive.

50:56.254 --> 50:57.586
And an alibi.

50:57.622 --> 50:58.487
The night Clayton Morrel died

could go to prison.

Paulina's DA days were over.

for evidence tampering.

knows that too

52:18.703 --> 52:20.603
So we have no idea
who was driving.

52:20.638 --> 52:21.704
No.

52:21.739 --> 52:23.172
But I've got a car patrolling
your street Hailey,

52:23.207 --> 52:24.206
just in case.

52:24.242 --> 52:25.474
Thank you.

52:25.510 --> 52:27.610
I'm going to see if Paulina has
any insight into all of this.

52:27.645 --> 52:28.711
Good idea.

52:28.746 --> 52:30.112
I'm going to see if I can track
down that violation

52:30.148 --> 52:30.746
that Alex mentioned.

52:30.781 --> 52:31.814
Meet ya at the food truck?

52:31.849 --> 52:32.248
Yes.

52:32.283 --> 52:33.449
See ya in a bit.

52:34.218 --> 52:36.085
Alex?

52:37.488 --> 52:38.988
[sighs]

52:39.023 --> 52:43.726
I don't know what to say.

52:43.761 --> 52:46.195
I know it's a shock.

52:46.230 --> 52:48.330
I brought him up through
the ranks.

52:48.366 --> 52:52.568
He was my righthand guy,
he would never,

52:52.603 --> 52:54.904
I mean, how could he do
something like this to me?

52:54.939 --> 53:00.676
I guess his ambition
overtook his loyalty.

53:00.711 --> 53:03.312
I thought I was losing my mind.

53:03.347 --> 53:04.980
I just never would have imagined
that Alex

53:05.016 --> 53:07.082
would do something like this.

53:07.118 --> 53:08.617
I'm so sorry.

53:09.420 --> 53:11.420
[sighs]

53:11.455 --> 53:13.055
I feel like such a fool.

53:13.090 --> 53:15.758
I knew something was going on,

53:15.793 --> 53:17.493
but then Clayton Morrel
got out of jail

53:17.528 --> 53:19.728
and I just couldn't
see straight.

53:19.764 --> 53:21.764
But you weren't letting
things slip.

53:21.799 --> 53:23.832
You were still in control.

53:23.868 --> 53:25.067
At work at least.

53:25.102 --> 53:27.536
Small consolation, I guess.

53:27.572 --> 53:29.905
You don't seem as surprised
about Derek.

53:33.477 --> 53:35.010
No.

53:37.615 --> 53:38.647
I actually wondered about Derek

53:38.683 --> 53:44.286
but I didn't want to think
he could be so cruel.

53:44.322 --> 53:47.756
Leading up to Clayton Morrel's
trial we were dating.

53:47.792 --> 53:50.226
It was getting serious actually.

53:50.261 --> 53:51.927
I had no idea.

53:51.963 --> 53:53.062
No one did.

53:53.097 --> 53:57.733
I think I just wanted to be sure
before it went public.

53:57.768 --> 54:03.272
But then Clayton Morrel wanted
to hire him to defend him.

54:03.307 --> 54:06.208
Had you ever come up across
the bench from him before?

54:06.244 --> 54:08.077
Sure.

54:08.112 --> 54:10.479
It's not unethical for opposing
counsel to date

54:10.514 --> 54:16.619
as long as you disclose it
to your client.

54:16.654 --> 54:18.721
But this wasn't
about legal ethics.

54:18.756 --> 54:20.222
It was about you.

54:22.460 --> 54:24.827
I just couldn't deal with him
defending a monster

54:24.862 --> 54:26.762
like Clayton Morrel.

54:26.797 --> 54:30.566
I... I didn't see a future
with a man

54:30.601 --> 54:35.938
who would do anything to have
a wife murderer set free.

54:35.973 --> 54:38.807
You couldn't separate the
personal from the professional.

54:38.843 --> 54:42.311
Not on that case. No.

54:42.346 --> 54:46.649
I ended the relationship
before the trial began

54:46.684 --> 54:48.250
and I broke his heart.

54:48.286 --> 54:50.452
I don't think he ever
forgave me.

54:50.488 --> 54:52.821
Can you think of a mistake
he made in the past

54:52.857 --> 54:56.358
that he would want
to cover up?

54:56.394 --> 54:58.527
No.

54:58.562 --> 55:01.430
But his career really
went downhill

55:01.465 --> 55:04.366
after Clayton was convicted.

55:04.402 --> 55:05.868
He's a changed man.

55:05.903 --> 55:08.871
I wouldn't put anything
past him.

55:08.906 --> 55:12.608
Would he frame you
for murder?

55:12.643 --> 55:16.178
I honestly don't know.

55:16.213 --> 55:20.349
But if he killed his client it
wasn't just to get back at me.

55:23.454 --> 55:27.122
So the good news is,
Paulina has been granted bail

55:27.158 --> 55:28.791
and she will be leaving today.

55:28.826 --> 55:32.061
She has to wear an ankle monitor
but it's better than jail.

55:32.096 --> 55:33.729
I'll swing by from time to time
to check on her,

55:33.764 --> 55:34.797
to make sure she's alright.

55:34.832 --> 55:37.266
In the meantime, I found out
that Clayton Morrel

55:37.301 --> 55:39.902
never paid Derek
for his legal services.

55:39.937 --> 55:42.237
That explains his reaction
when Monty mentioned

55:42.273 --> 55:43.972
billing by the hour.

55:44.008 --> 55:45.407
Was he being blackmailed?

55:45.443 --> 55:46.975
Maybe that's the violation
that Derek wanted Alex

55:47.011 --> 55:48.310
to cover up for him.

55:48.346 --> 55:49.945
If anyone would know,
Naomi would.

55:49.980 --> 55:52.815
Yeah, I tried to talk to her,
it didn't happen.

55:52.850 --> 55:54.750
There is one other person
who knows just as much

55:54.785 --> 55:56.618
about Clayton Morrel
as anyone.

55:56.654 --> 55:58.253
My thoughts exactly.

55:59.724 --> 56:02.257
I don't know exactly
what Clayton had over Derek

56:02.293 --> 56:05.627
but whatever it was the threat
of putting it in the book

56:05.663 --> 56:08.330
was enough to keep Derek
on as his lawyer.

56:08.366 --> 56:09.298
I bet the publisher

56:09.333 --> 56:11.800
wouldn't even have even
put it in the book.

56:11.836 --> 56:15.204
Were there a lot of things
that didn't go in the book?

56:15.239 --> 56:18.140
They wanted Clayton to come
off as sympathetic,

56:18.175 --> 56:20.642
so everything leading up
to the trial and after

56:20.678 --> 56:24.613
it had to frame Clayton
in the most human way.

56:24.648 --> 56:27.683
I take it that isn't what you
wanted to write.

56:27.718 --> 56:29.218
It wasn't my choice.

56:29.253 --> 56:30.686
But Clayton wanted me
to write the truth.

56:30.721 --> 56:32.688
He wanted everyone to know
exactly what he'd done.

56:32.723 --> 56:34.390
That must have been difficult
for you,

56:34.425 --> 56:37.459
writing about the murder
of one friend by another.

56:37.495 --> 56:38.961
Why are you asking
all of this?

56:38.996 --> 56:41.397
We're just trying to get
the whole picture.

56:41.432 --> 56:43.565
You don't think the District
Attorney is guilty?

56:43.601 --> 56:45.067
I work for the DA's office.

56:45.102 --> 56:46.835
With high profile cases
like this we have to make sure

56:46.871 --> 56:49.405
all the avenues are explored
before we can move forward.

56:49.440 --> 56:50.239
Of course.

56:50.274 --> 56:51.473
Yes.

56:51.509 --> 56:54.243
Well the only thing Clayton
told me was that he didn't think

56:54.278 --> 56:56.578
Derek was worth paying
since he couldn't win a trial

56:56.614 --> 56:59.515
even by manufacturing
evidence.

56:59.550 --> 57:02.384
Manufacturing evidence?

57:02.420 --> 57:04.520
Could you say more about that?

57:05.589 --> 57:08.023
[hums]

57:10.594 --> 57:14.196
You know I'm a lawyer, right?

57:14.231 --> 57:17.833
I don't have to say anything
to you.

57:17.868 --> 57:20.436
I noticed you didn't obtain
your own representation.

57:20.471 --> 57:22.337
Because I have nothing
to hide.

57:22.373 --> 57:25.107
Tell me about the Clayton Morrel
case 10 years ago.

57:25.142 --> 57:26.074
What about it?

57:26.110 --> 57:28.210
We received information
that Clayton Morrel

57:28.245 --> 57:31.079
was blackmailing you
for free legal services.

57:31.115 --> 57:32.014
<i> Is that true?</i>

57:32.049 --> 57:33.148
No.

57:33.184 --> 57:35.117
Did you see how he blurted
his answer out so quickly.

57:35.152 --> 57:36.185
That's a tactic.

57:36.220 --> 57:37.319
Not a good one.

57:37.354 --> 57:39.721
<i> Then the reason for the</i>
<i> blackmail was also false?</i>

57:39.757 --> 57:41.423
Obviously.

57:41.459 --> 57:42.357
He's shaken now.

57:42.393 --> 57:44.526
Did you go to Alex Mathers
and promise him

57:44.562 --> 57:47.429
that you would get rid of
Paulina D'Orazio,

57:47.465 --> 57:49.798
if he would get rid
of a mistake for you?

57:49.834 --> 57:55.571
Did you kill Clayton Morrel
and frame Paulina D'Orazio?

57:55.606 --> 57:56.905
No.

57:56.941 --> 57:58.240
Not so obvious that time.

57:58.275 --> 57:59.274
Mmhmm.

57:59.310 --> 58:00.576
<i> It would make sense.</i>

58:00.611 --> 58:01.777
Get rid of the blackmailer

58:01.812 --> 58:04.480
and the woman who broke your
heart all in one fell swoop.

58:04.515 --> 58:07.182
I swear I didn't kill anyone.

58:09.620 --> 58:11.386
Yes.

58:11.422 --> 58:13.388
Clayton was blackmailing me.

58:13.424 --> 58:16.291
<i> Because you manufactured</i>
<i> evidence?</i>

58:16.327 --> 58:17.826
<i> When?</i>

58:17.862 --> 58:20.229
<i> During his trial?</i>

58:20.264 --> 58:23.665
Yes, I manufactured evidence
at Clayton's trial.

58:23.701 --> 58:26.735
A man's shoe print out
of the bathroom window.

58:26.770 --> 58:28.904
I was hoping to help
Clayton's claim

58:28.939 --> 58:30.606
that someone had tried
to break in.

58:30.641 --> 58:32.107
It didn't work obviously.

58:32.142 --> 58:33.509
The judge threw it out
because it wasn't processed

58:33.544 --> 58:34.776
through the police lab.

58:34.812 --> 58:36.612
Because if it had been,

58:36.647 --> 58:39.014
the police would have realized
it was a fake.

58:39.049 --> 58:43.151
I made up the whole report,
staged photographs, everything.

58:43.187 --> 58:45.120
It was stupid.

58:45.155 --> 58:49.791
And I regret it.

58:49.827 --> 58:52.661
I just wanted to beat Paulina.

58:52.696 --> 58:53.762
[dialling]

58:53.797 --> 58:54.796
Who are you calling?

58:54.832 --> 58:56.598
I'm texting Monty.

58:56.634 --> 58:58.600
I have a feeling.

58:58.636 --> 59:00.836
[message alert]

59:05.676 --> 59:09.011
Did you threaten Hailey
in the parking garage?

59:09.046 --> 59:11.680
<i> I assume the truck doesn't</i>
<i> belong to you</i>

59:11.715 --> 59:14.116
<i> and I have a feeling</i>
<i> that a quick check</i>

59:14.151 --> 59:15.484
through your credit card
statements

59:15.519 --> 59:18.120
would list a recent vehicle
rental.

59:18.155 --> 59:19.788
I knew that if she kept
poking around,

59:19.823 --> 59:21.290
she'd find out about
it eventually.

59:21.325 --> 59:23.458
I thought I could
scare her off.

59:23.494 --> 59:25.661
<i> And what about the night</i>
<i> Clayton Morrel was killed?</i>

59:25.696 --> 59:26.995
<i> Did you try to scare him</i>
<i> off too?</i>

59:27.031 --> 59:28.964
I don't have an alibi.

59:28.999 --> 59:30.032
But I didn't kill him.

59:30.067 --> 59:31.700
And I didn't frame Paulina.

59:31.735 --> 59:34.670
<i>And how were you proposing to</i>
<i>get rid of her for DA Mathers?</i>

59:34.705 --> 59:36.838
I was going to take the stand
during her trial

59:36.874 --> 59:38.574
and testify about
our relationship.

59:38.609 --> 59:44.313
I was going to say that Paulina
used me for information

59:44.348 --> 59:46.315
that allowed her to win
the original case

59:46.350 --> 59:48.016
that sent Clayton to prison.

59:48.052 --> 59:51.353
<i> And was that true?</i>

59:51.388 --> 59:52.354
It could have been.

59:52.389 --> 59:53.722
Perjury is a crime.

59:53.757 --> 59:55.424
Yeah, but it isn't murder.

59:55.459 --> 59:57.192
And you can't arrest me
for something

59:57.227 --> 1:00:01.897
that I might have said
in the future.

1:00:01.932 --> 1:00:03.832
Clayton's death doesn't solve
my problem.

1:00:03.867 --> 1:00:05.500
Naomi knows everything

1:00:05.536 --> 1:00:08.503
so I'm still stuck representing
her pro bono.

1:00:08.539 --> 1:00:12.774
You want a real suspect,
dig into her deeper.

1:00:12.810 --> 1:00:16.044
What you'll find
will surprise you.

1:00:16.880 --> 1:00:18.213
[sighs]

1:00:19.984 --> 1:00:22.351
Hailey how did you know Derek
was the one who threatened you?

1:00:22.386 --> 1:00:23.285
I didn't.

1:00:23.320 --> 1:00:24.386
Not for sure.

1:00:24.421 --> 1:00:26.722
But it didn't make sense to me
that the real killer

1:00:26.757 --> 1:00:29.858
would risk proving they were
still out there.

1:00:29.893 --> 1:00:31.560
So Derek's motive
for scaring you off was

1:00:31.595 --> 1:00:33.695
to keep his secret under wraps.

1:00:33.731 --> 1:00:35.397
So now I guess we believe
that Derek wasn't the one

1:00:35.432 --> 1:00:36.932
who planted the knife
in Paulina's car.

1:00:36.967 --> 1:00:38.800
And we're still looking
for the person who did.

1:00:38.836 --> 1:00:41.203
When we originally looked
into Naomi Morrel,

1:00:41.238 --> 1:00:43.038
we didn't look outside
of Georgia

1:00:43.073 --> 1:00:45.073
so I ran her fingerprints
through AFIS.

1:00:45.109 --> 1:00:46.375
You found something.

1:00:46.410 --> 1:00:49.978
Naomi Morrel's real name
is Melody Gorenski.

1:00:50.014 --> 1:00:52.247
She lived in Seattle,
moved here six years ago,

1:00:52.282 --> 1:00:53.615
changed her name,

1:00:53.651 --> 1:00:55.884
and started visiting
Clayton Morrel in prison.

1:00:55.919 --> 1:00:57.052
Why'd she change her name?

1:00:57.087 --> 1:00:58.286
A year after Clayton Morrel

1:00:58.322 --> 1:01:00.055
was convicted for
the murder of his wife,

1:01:00.090 --> 1:01:02.658
Naomi or Melody as she
was then called

1:01:02.693 --> 1:01:06.662
was arrested for the attempted
murder of her husband.

1:01:06.697 --> 1:01:07.663
[laughs]

1:01:07.698 --> 1:01:09.998
I did not see that one coming.

1:01:10.034 --> 1:01:11.500
So, what exactly happened?

1:01:11.535 --> 1:01:13.902
Well, not much according
to Seattle police.

1:01:13.937 --> 1:01:16.672
Her husband found detailed plans
outlining how she would do it.

1:01:16.707 --> 1:01:19.975
She was arrested, charged
and found not guilty.

1:01:20.010 --> 1:01:21.576
That was a lenient judge.

1:01:21.612 --> 1:01:23.812
Well she claimed it was
an elaborate prank.

1:01:23.847 --> 1:01:24.846
[laughs]

1:01:24.882 --> 1:01:26.348
I bet the husband disagreed.

1:01:26.383 --> 1:01:28.450
They divorced and the rest
we know.

1:01:28.485 --> 1:01:30.585
So, when did she start
corresponding with Clayton?

1:01:30.621 --> 1:01:31.953
Right after he was convicted.

1:01:31.989 --> 1:01:34.022
Police found letters from him
encouraging her

1:01:34.058 --> 1:01:37.359
to free herself of her husband
and come be with him instead.

1:01:37.394 --> 1:01:40.629
Seattle police believe that he
was influencing her to do it.

1:01:40.664 --> 1:01:42.664
I don't know about that.

1:01:42.700 --> 1:01:45.934
Naomi exhibits many of
the same traits as Clayton.

1:01:45.969 --> 1:01:47.836
Lack of empathy
is a key indicator

1:01:47.871 --> 1:01:49.805
of sociopathic tendencies.

1:01:49.840 --> 1:01:52.474
She planned on killing
one husband and didn't go
through with it.

1:01:52.509 --> 1:01:55.010
Maybe second husband's
a charm.

1:01:55.045 --> 1:01:56.578
Maybe.

1:02:01.318 --> 1:02:03.518
I'm not saying anything
until my lawyer gets here.

1:02:03.554 --> 1:02:06.188
Oh, didn't he tell you?

1:02:06.223 --> 1:02:08.323
We know all about the evidence
he manufactured

1:02:08.358 --> 1:02:09.257
in your husband's trial

1:02:09.293 --> 1:02:11.993
and he will no longer be
representing you.

1:02:12.029 --> 1:02:16.164
So, let's pick up where we
left off last time Naomi.

1:02:16.200 --> 1:02:18.700
Or should I call you Melody?

1:02:18.736 --> 1:02:20.469
I don't know what
you're talking about.

1:02:20.504 --> 1:02:22.337
<i> Naomi, this is going--</i>

1:02:22.372 --> 1:02:24.639
[rewinds]

1:02:24.675 --> 1:02:26.508
I don't know what
you're talking about.

1:02:26.543 --> 1:02:31.780
Naomi this is going to go much
better for you if you're honest.

1:02:31.815 --> 1:02:33.482
I know all about your
first husband

1:02:33.517 --> 1:02:36.485
and your plans to kill him.

1:02:36.520 --> 1:02:39.621
Why didn't you go through
with it?

1:02:39.656 --> 1:02:40.989
It was just a prank.

1:02:41.024 --> 1:02:42.390
But then your second husband
ends up dead

1:02:42.426 --> 1:02:43.992
and you have no alibi.

1:02:44.027 --> 1:02:45.093
<i> You can see why</i>

1:02:45.129 --> 1:02:46.728
<i> I would find that coincidence</i>
<i> hard to believe.</i>

1:02:46.764 --> 1:02:48.296
It is a coincidence.

1:02:48.332 --> 1:02:49.397
I didn't kill Clayton.

1:02:49.433 --> 1:02:52.334
<i> Why did you lie about where</i>
<i> you were that day?</i>

1:02:52.369 --> 1:02:54.703
I lied because I knew you'd try
to pin this on me.

1:02:54.738 --> 1:02:59.407
Why did you come back to Atlanta
last Friday?

1:02:59.443 --> 1:03:01.910
You can tell me or you can
go to jail.

1:03:01.945 --> 1:03:04.179
Fine.

1:03:04.214 --> 1:03:06.715
I came for a meeting
about a reality show.

1:03:06.750 --> 1:03:07.716
I don't follow.

1:03:07.751 --> 1:03:11.019
A producer wants to make
a reality show about me

1:03:11.054 --> 1:03:13.755
and my life as a wife
of a murderer.

1:03:13.791 --> 1:03:16.558
Oh, and was your husband okay
with this?

1:03:16.593 --> 1:03:17.259
Hardly.

1:03:17.294 --> 1:03:18.727
It's why Clayton and I fought.

1:03:18.762 --> 1:03:20.996
He refused to let me do it.

1:03:21.031 --> 1:03:23.331
He was the star in our family.

1:03:23.367 --> 1:03:25.400
He didn't want any competition.

1:03:25.435 --> 1:03:27.402
Well I can see why
you'd be angry.

1:03:27.437 --> 1:03:29.437
I told him I was going away
for a few days.

1:03:29.473 --> 1:03:32.040
I drove back, had a meeting
with the producer,

1:03:32.075 --> 1:03:33.375
they took me out for dinner.

1:03:33.410 --> 1:03:35.710
<i> Why didn't you just</i>
<i> tell me this.</i>

1:03:35.746 --> 1:03:37.445
<i> They made me sign an NDA.</i>

1:03:37.481 --> 1:03:39.915
They didn't want anyone
copying their idea

1:03:39.950 --> 1:03:42.584
before the network green-lit it.

1:03:42.619 --> 1:03:45.220
Now I'm gonna get sued.

1:03:47.724 --> 1:03:49.124
I confirmed Naomi's alibi,

1:03:49.159 --> 1:03:51.293
the story about the reality
show is true.

1:03:51.328 --> 1:03:53.562
I can't believe anyone
would want to watch that.

1:03:53.597 --> 1:03:56.398
It's not something I'd watch
but I've seen the fascination.

1:03:56.433 --> 1:03:57.599
I bet the producers weren't
too happy

1:03:57.634 --> 1:03:58.867
that the cops came calling.

1:03:58.902 --> 1:04:01.136
Or on the contrary,
they were ecstatic.

1:04:01.171 --> 1:04:02.270
They asked if I would be willing

1:04:02.306 --> 1:04:05.473
to pose for publicity shots
of Naomi being arrested.

1:04:05.509 --> 1:04:06.408
Hmph.

1:04:06.443 --> 1:04:08.977
That's- I don't even know
what that is.

1:04:09.012 --> 1:04:12.781
This means that Naomi is
no longer a viable suspect.

1:04:12.816 --> 1:04:14.216
Paulina's still on the hook.

1:04:14.251 --> 1:04:15.150
Yeah, I'm afraid so.

1:04:15.185 --> 1:04:16.351
And the only outstanding
piece of evidence

1:04:16.386 --> 1:04:19.487
that we haven't been able to tie
her to is the shoe print.

1:04:19.523 --> 1:04:21.590
We've done a full search
of Paulina's home,

1:04:21.625 --> 1:04:24.092
office and everywhere
in between but nothing.

1:04:24.127 --> 1:04:25.393
Then there's still hope.

1:04:25.429 --> 1:04:27.128
That's what I admire about you,
Hailey.

1:04:27.164 --> 1:04:29.798
You always find a glimmer
of hope.

1:04:32.970 --> 1:04:35.103
I'll look for the shoe but if
the cops haven't found it yet

1:04:35.138 --> 1:04:36.504
I don't know what
I'll be able to do.

1:04:36.540 --> 1:04:38.173
And it may never be found
which at least means

1:04:38.208 --> 1:04:41.109
it cannot be linked to Paulina.

1:04:41.144 --> 1:04:44.179
Do you ever think
that Paulina's guilty?

1:04:44.214 --> 1:04:46.147
Honestly, no.

1:04:46.183 --> 1:04:48.250
Why? Have you?

1:04:48.285 --> 1:04:49.985
I have to admit
I've had my moments.

1:04:50.020 --> 1:04:51.286
There's a lot of evidence
piled against her.

1:04:51.321 --> 1:04:52.220
I get it.

1:04:52.256 --> 1:04:52.888
Yeah but you've never wavered.
Not once.

1:04:52.923 --> 1:04:54.656
Even when everybody else is.

1:04:54.691 --> 1:04:57.125
As much as Paulina may
have thought about murder,

1:04:57.160 --> 1:04:58.193
I know her.

1:04:58.228 --> 1:05:00.428
And she would never
break the law,

1:05:00.464 --> 1:05:02.697
no matter how much she thinks
it had failed her.

1:05:02.733 --> 1:05:06.668
Well I know that you'll always
believe in me the same way.

1:05:06.703 --> 1:05:09.004
Fincher please don't tell me
that you're about to be arrested

1:05:09.039 --> 1:05:10.639
for a crime you didn't commit.

1:05:10.674 --> 1:05:13.008
Not that I know of,
but if I was,

1:05:13.043 --> 1:05:16.011
I know you'd be there, you know,
prove me innocent.

1:05:16.046 --> 1:05:17.812
Assuming you were innocent.

1:05:17.848 --> 1:05:19.547
You think I have it in me
to be a criminal.

1:05:19.583 --> 1:05:20.682
Under the right circumstances.

1:05:20.717 --> 1:05:21.650
Like what?

1:05:21.685 --> 1:05:24.319
Like okay say that all
the burritos in Atlanta

1:05:24.354 --> 1:05:26.988
were locked up in a
high security vault.

1:05:27.024 --> 1:05:29.124
So last time it was the food
trucks now--

1:05:29.159 --> 1:05:30.125
Just burritos this time.

1:05:30.160 --> 1:05:31.326
Burritos.

1:05:31.361 --> 1:05:33.895
Okay, and you think I'd be
the first person to break in.

1:05:33.931 --> 1:05:35.063
You'd be absolutely right.

1:05:35.098 --> 1:05:37.465
Desperate times call for
desperate burrito burglaries.

1:05:37.501 --> 1:05:38.233
I'd be a hero--

1:05:38.268 --> 1:05:39.067
Mmhmm.

1:05:39.102 --> 1:05:40.035
Modern day Robin Hood.

1:05:40.070 --> 1:05:41.836
Protecting Atlanta from
a burrito-less future.

1:05:41.872 --> 1:05:43.705
Why do I get the feeling that
we're gonna make a detour

1:05:43.740 --> 1:05:44.839
on the way to my office.

1:05:44.875 --> 1:05:46.241
You know me too well, girl.

1:05:46.276 --> 1:05:47.509
You got me thinking
about burritos all day.

1:05:47.544 --> 1:05:49.010
That's all you ever
think about.

1:05:49.046 --> 1:05:49.811
Oh hey.

1:05:49.846 --> 1:05:50.612
Yo.

1:05:50.647 --> 1:05:52.614
I know how we can
get there fast.

1:05:57.587 --> 1:05:58.753
Hi, do you have a minute?

1:05:58.789 --> 1:06:00.755
For you, always.

1:06:00.791 --> 1:06:03.158
Amelia didn't show and she's not
answering her phone

1:06:03.193 --> 1:06:04.926
or responding to my texts.

1:06:04.962 --> 1:06:06.227
And she didn't call to cancel?

1:06:06.263 --> 1:06:06.995
No.

1:06:07.030 --> 1:06:08.396
And I'd go make sure
she's okay

1:06:08.432 --> 1:06:09.764
but I have a client due
any minute.

1:06:09.800 --> 1:06:11.433
Why don't I run by
her school right now?

1:06:11.468 --> 1:06:13.501
Thank you, I'm sorry to drag
you into this again,

1:06:13.537 --> 1:06:14.736
I'm... I'm just worried.

1:06:14.771 --> 1:06:16.204
Me too.

1:06:24.982 --> 1:06:27.916
Hi, look at this.

1:06:27.951 --> 1:06:29.551
Well, thanks to Miss Lincoln.

1:06:29.586 --> 1:06:31.753
She organized the whole thing.

1:06:31.788 --> 1:06:34.055
It's a great way to teach our
students about sustainability

1:06:34.091 --> 1:06:36.024
and all the proceeds
are going to charity.

1:06:36.059 --> 1:06:36.992
That's a great idea.

1:06:37.027 --> 1:06:38.860
Miss Lincoln's actually
who I'm looking for.

1:06:38.895 --> 1:06:40.762
Oh, I'm afraid she isn't here.

1:06:40.797 --> 1:06:41.663
Is she alright?

1:06:41.698 --> 1:06:44.032
I'm Hailey Dean.
I'm a friend of hers.

1:06:44.067 --> 1:06:45.767
Honestly, I don't know.

1:06:45.802 --> 1:06:47.302
I haven't been able
to reach her.

1:06:47.337 --> 1:06:49.804
She's been planning this
clothing drive for months.

1:06:49.840 --> 1:06:51.439
I can't believe
she's missing it.

1:06:51.475 --> 1:06:53.708
Oh, put those over
by the shoes.

1:06:53.744 --> 1:06:54.576
Shoes?

1:06:54.611 --> 1:06:56.778
A last-minute addition
to the drive.

1:06:56.813 --> 1:07:00.615
Miss Lincoln thought we might
as well sell full outfits.

♪

1:07:22.672 --> 1:07:23.805

that we found at the scene of
Clayton Morrel's murder.

1:07:26.443 --> 1:07:28.676
It's got Amelia's DNA
all over it.

1:07:28.712 --> 1:07:30.011
This is her shoe.

1:07:30.047 --> 1:07:31.479
I sent a car out
to her apartment.

1:07:31.515 --> 1:07:32.247
She isn't there.

1:07:32.282 --> 1:07:34.315
I tried calling her,
no answer.

1:07:34.351 --> 1:07:35.350
I don't understand.

1:07:35.385 --> 1:07:37.185
She was at parent teacher night.

1:07:37.220 --> 1:07:38.019
She was.

1:07:38.055 --> 1:07:39.154
I called everyone
on the schedule.

1:07:39.189 --> 1:07:41.589
One parent didn't show up
and Amelia didn't mark it

1:07:41.625 --> 1:07:43.992
in the record that she
submitted to the office.

1:07:44.027 --> 1:07:45.660
Do you think she could have
gotten from the school

1:07:45.695 --> 1:07:47.362
to the Morrel house and back?

1:07:47.397 --> 1:07:48.763
I checked her car's GPS.

1:07:48.799 --> 1:07:49.831
And it verified the route.

1:07:49.866 --> 1:07:50.532
It did.

1:07:50.567 --> 1:07:52.367
And I have APB out for Amelia.

1:07:52.402 --> 1:07:55.136
In the meantime, I need
to go see the chief.

1:07:55.172 --> 1:07:56.805
This is good news, Hailey.

1:07:56.840 --> 1:07:59.607

It must have been so scary.

I'm just glad I'm home.

1:08:16.726 --> 1:08:21.896
Though showering with this ankle

1:08:21.932 --> 1:08:23.231
It shouldn't be much longer.

I can't help but feel

1:08:28.505 --> 1:08:29.370
I can understand that feeling

Intellectually, yes.

murder in the first degree

1:08:35.946 --> 1:08:37.979
and not manslaughter
10 years ago,

1:08:38.014 --> 1:08:39.581
Clayton Morrel would still be
in jail

1:08:39.616 --> 1:08:41.049

1:18:45.154 --> 1:18:47.321
You killed him
to avenge Tamara?

1:18:47.356 --> 1:18:49.690
[Frank cries]

1:18:49.726 --> 1:18:51.459
I couldn't take it.

1:18:52.428 --> 1:18:55.730
Clayton out there, Clayton free,
and a book out there,

1:18:55.765 --> 1:18:57.865
I just... I didn't know
what to do, Hailey.

1:18:57.900 --> 1:18:59.834
But you knew enough
about crime

1:18:59.869 --> 1:19:01.368
to know that you had
to have a plan.

1:19:01.404 --> 1:19:03.571
You needed to get rid
of your witnesses

1:19:03.606 --> 1:19:07.508
and that's why you sent Walter
on a fishing trip.

1:19:07.543 --> 1:19:08.509
You knew.

1:19:08.544 --> 1:19:10.845
I saw the "Gone Fishing" sign
in your window.

1:19:10.880 --> 1:19:12.680
Walter had the same one.

1:19:12.715 --> 1:19:14.749
And then you needed a fall guy
and that was Paulina.

1:19:14.784 --> 1:19:15.916
Yeah.

1:19:15.952 --> 1:19:18.886
You sent me the note, you
lured me to the parking lot

1:19:18.921 --> 1:19:22.356
that was close enough to the
house to make it plausible,

1:19:22.391 --> 1:19:24.658
and you planted
the knife in my car?

1:19:24.694 --> 1:19:25.659
[Paulina gasps]

1:19:25.695 --> 1:19:27.061
In your own driveway.

1:19:27.096 --> 1:19:28.329
It was a good plan Frank.

1:19:28.364 --> 1:19:30.931
The thing I don't understand,
you were getting away with it,

1:19:30.967 --> 1:19:32.700
why would you kidnap her?

1:19:32.735 --> 1:19:34.902
No, no, don't you see?

1:19:34.937 --> 1:19:37.538
It was because of her
that Clayton was only in jail

1:19:37.573 --> 1:19:38.405
for 10 years.

1:19:38.441 --> 1:19:40.307
He should have been there
for life!

1:19:40.643 --> 1:19:41.976
[gasping]

1:19:43.613 --> 1:19:46.413
She doesn't deserve to tell
her truth, Hailey.

1:19:46.449 --> 1:19:48.716
She doesn't deserve
her day in court.

1:19:48.751 --> 1:19:50.584
That isn't justice!

1:19:50.620 --> 1:19:52.052
[chair smacks floor]

1:19:55.424 --> 1:19:56.557
You're not gonna stop me.

1:19:56.592 --> 1:19:59.093
So, what do you need next?

1:19:59.128 --> 1:20:00.594
I need to make it look like
Paulina here

1:20:00.630 --> 1:20:02.396
can't stand the guilt.

1:20:02.431 --> 1:20:04.598
And what better place to have
her commit suicide

1:20:04.634 --> 1:20:07.735
than the house where this
whole nightmare started?

1:20:07.770 --> 1:20:09.537
That's the ultimate
poetic justice.

1:20:09.572 --> 1:20:10.905
You really thought
this through.

1:20:10.940 --> 1:20:12.039
Except for the part about me.

1:20:12.074 --> 1:20:12.840
I know.

1:20:12.875 --> 1:20:14.642
I don't want to kill you,
Hailey.

1:20:14.677 --> 1:20:16.043
Then don't.

1:20:16.078 --> 1:20:17.378
I've killed one,
what's two more?

1:20:17.413 --> 1:20:19.980
Two more makes you
a serial killer.

1:20:20.016 --> 1:20:21.982
Two more makes you worse
than Clayton Morrel.

1:20:22.018 --> 1:20:23.617
I just don't know
what to do.

1:20:26.088 --> 1:20:27.388
[smack]

1:20:27.423 --> 1:20:28.789
Ah.

1:20:29.759 --> 1:20:30.891
<i> -Hailey! </i>
<i> -Hailey!!</i>

1:20:32.295 --> 1:20:34.128
Oh.

1:20:34.163 --> 1:20:35.129
Hailey, you got him?

1:20:35.164 --> 1:20:36.630
Yeah.

1:20:36.666 --> 1:20:39.433
[breaths heavily]

1:20:46.776 --> 1:20:47.641
Hailey.

1:20:47.677 --> 1:20:48.809
You're looking well.

1:20:48.845 --> 1:20:49.977
I feel well.

1:20:50.012 --> 1:20:52.246
Better than I have
in a long time.

1:20:52.281 --> 1:20:53.681
How's Walter Faraday?

1:20:53.716 --> 1:20:55.182
He'll make a full recovery.

1:20:55.218 --> 1:20:56.784
Oh, I'm so relieved to hear it.

1:20:56.819 --> 1:20:58.519
I owe him a visit.

1:20:58.554 --> 1:20:59.620
What about Frank?

1:20:59.655 --> 1:21:02.857
I have been assured that
he is going to plead guilty.

1:21:02.892 --> 1:21:04.458
I think that's a wise move.

1:21:04.493 --> 1:21:05.860
Have you talked to Amelia?

1:21:05.895 --> 1:21:07.962
She's back in therapy
and she will be just fine.

1:21:07.997 --> 1:21:10.130
Oh she wanted to thank us
for making good use

1:21:10.166 --> 1:21:12.533
of her family vase.

1:21:12.568 --> 1:21:14.602
How about you?

1:21:14.637 --> 1:21:16.804
I don't think I realized
how wrapped up

1:21:16.839 --> 1:21:18.439
I've been in the past.

1:21:18.474 --> 1:21:20.507
I'm really looking forward
to starting my own practice.

1:21:20.543 --> 1:21:22.276
I could use the change of pace.

1:21:22.311 --> 1:21:23.510
Oh, so you're going
to slow down.

1:21:23.546 --> 1:21:25.212
Why not? You did.

1:21:25.248 --> 1:21:26.614
That's true.

1:21:26.649 --> 1:21:28.482
Do you need some help?

1:21:28.517 --> 1:21:29.850
Not anymore.

1:21:29.886 --> 1:21:31.252
I'm good now.

1:21:36.259 --> 1:21:38.726
So all's well that ends well.

1:21:38.761 --> 1:21:40.060
Got a little scary there
for a bit.

1:21:40.096 --> 1:21:41.662
I'll admit it.

1:21:41.697 --> 1:21:43.364
So, you and Jonas
finally have your big date?

1:21:43.399 --> 1:21:45.132
Why are you so interested
in my love life?

1:21:45.167 --> 1:21:46.533
I just want you to be happy.

1:21:46.569 --> 1:21:47.868
Sure you do.

1:21:47.904 --> 1:21:48.769
You sound like
you don't believe me.

1:21:48.804 --> 1:21:50.638
What's been going on
the last few days?

1:21:50.673 --> 1:21:52.773
I told you it's not
my story to tell.

1:22:02.885 --> 1:22:04.184
[knocks]

1:22:04.220 --> 1:22:05.286
<i> Come in!</i>

1:22:16.866 --> 1:22:17.698
What's all this?

1:22:17.733 --> 1:22:18.666
It's our anniversary.

1:22:18.701 --> 1:22:21.101
Or I should say all
of our anniversaries.

1:22:21.137 --> 1:22:23.537
This is the wine we had
the first night we first met,

1:22:23.572 --> 1:22:25.539
these are the cheesesteaks
we ate

1:22:25.574 --> 1:22:27.174
the next night
we got together.

1:22:27.209 --> 1:22:30.244
And that's the lipstick you
wore the first time we kissed.

1:22:31.614 --> 1:22:34.848
Hailey, this is incredible.

1:22:34.884 --> 1:22:37.685
Fincher was right,
it's the perfect date.

1:22:37.720 --> 1:22:38.852
Fincher?

1:22:38.888 --> 1:22:41.455
Is that why he was asking me
all those weird questions?

1:22:41.490 --> 1:22:44.458
I asked him to keep it
a secret.

1:22:44.493 --> 1:22:46.393
I wanted to create
the perfect night,

1:22:46.429 --> 1:22:50.230
but it looks like
I didn't need to.

1:22:50.266 --> 1:22:53.434
I just felt so bad about missing
all of our anniversaries.

1:22:53.469 --> 1:22:55.936
So, I thought, you know what,
let's just have a new one.

1:22:55.972 --> 1:22:58.572
That's exactly what
I was hoping to do.

1:23:06.015 --> 1:23:07.147
Hailey Dean.

1:23:07.183 --> 1:23:12.753
I have loved you since the
very first moment I met you.

1:23:12.788 --> 1:23:14.722
Will you marry me?

1:23:15.524 --> 1:23:16.924
Yes.
