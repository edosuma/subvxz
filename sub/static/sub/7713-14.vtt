blackmailed Angela,

Michael asked them
both to step down

Committee because there
was too much drama.

What he said was. . .
Just. . . Easy.

. . .there was a problem
with having one head of
the Party Planning Committee.

so he appointed two heads.

the radio?

No, l need silence
or Sam Kinison
to prepare.

But then you fall asleep
and there's nothing
for me to do.

05:22.698 --> 05:24.949
Then listen to
your iPod, Pam.
That's dangerous.

wearing that much.

someone out there
hates me.

05:54.604 --> 05:57.481
l even hate thinking
that al-Qaeda hates me.

05:58.233 --> 05:59.734

got to know me,

05:59.818 --> 06:01.444
they wouldn't
hate me.

hates me, so. . .

11:11.921 --> 11:14.673
Here a woof, there a woof
Everywhere a woof-woof

11:16.051 --> 11:17.384
You get it.

11:17.594 --> 11:20.929
l don't know you.
But l need to know you
in order to sell to you.

11:21.556 --> 11:23.807
That is why l've asked you
to go around and
tell me your names.

11:24.267 --> 11:26.018
l have an amazing
mnemonic device

11:26.102 --> 11:29.605
by which l have
now memorized
all of your names.

11:31.107 --> 11:35.986
Shirty, mole, lazy eye,
Mexico, baldy,

11:36.321 --> 11:38.113
sugar boobs,
black woman.

11:38.531 --> 11:41.658
l have taken
a unique part
of who you are

11:42.118 --> 11:45.704
and l have used that
to memorize your name.

11:46.206 --> 11:49.625
Baldy, your head is bald,
it is hairless,

11:49.793 --> 11:54.463
it is shiny,
it is reflective,
like a mirror.

11:54.547 --> 11:56.382
"M," your name is Mark.

11:56.800 --> 11:59.093
Yes.
Got it. lt works!

11:59.177 --> 12:01.387
Uh, it's very insulting.

12:01.471 --> 12:02.679
But it works.

12:02.764 --> 12:05.891
l would like you all
to give this a shot.
What do you say?

12:05.975 --> 12:08.602
But we already know
each other's names.

12:08.686 --> 12:11.021
Well, then it will be
easier for you.

12:11.106 --> 12:13.315
But l still think
it's worthwhile
to give it a try.

12:13.400 --> 12:15.734
Okay, all right, everyone.
Meeting's over.

12:15.819 --> 12:16.944
But l still have more.

12:17.028 --> 12:19.321
Can l please see you
in my office, please?

12:20.031 --> 12:23.367
She is pregnant.
She is knocked up.
"K," Karen.

12:23.493 --> 12:24.701
Pam, let's go.

12:28.248 --> 12:30.082
l can't accept
these prices, Stanley.

12:30.166 --> 12:31.333
They just cut
our budget.

12:31.418 --> 12:33.168
Brought you guys
some coffees.

12:33.253 --> 12:35.295
Stanley, l know you have
adult-onset diabetes,

12:35.380 --> 12:38.507
so l put Splenda
in yours.

12:39.175 --> 12:40.843
Let's see, how many
did l put in there?

12:41.386 --> 12:45.681
(SlNGlNG) One, two,
three, four SpIendas
in your coffee, StanIey

12:45.765 --> 12:49.560
None in yours, JuIia,
because I don't know
how you take it

12:49.644 --> 12:51.270
But if you'd rather...

12:51.354 --> 12:53.605
Four Splenda?
Are you crazy?

12:53.690 --> 12:55.107
No, l actually
only put in two,

12:55.191 --> 12:57.943
but that's not how
the song goes.

12:58.027 --> 13:01.738
Are you out of
your damn mind?

13:02.323 --> 13:04.700
You bring an angel
like that into
this office

13:04.784 --> 13:07.161
and you don't even
set me up with her.

13:07.495 --> 13:10.205
We're not friends.
l didn't think about it.

13:10.623 --> 13:13.542
We are friends.
Stanley, we're friends.

13:14.252 --> 13:15.878
And you let me down.

13:17.755 --> 13:19.548
You really like her, huh?

13:19.632 --> 13:22.885
Yeah, l really like her
with all my heart.

13:26.973 --> 13:28.557
Give me two clients
for her.

13:29.184 --> 13:32.394
l grab this,
and l turn it on
and l say,

13:32.479 --> 13:35.981
"Prepare yourself for the
Utica Chain Store Massacre."

13:36.065 --> 13:38.650
No, that is
incredibly dangerous.

13:38.735 --> 13:40.319
No, don't worry,
the chain is off.

13:40.403 --> 13:41.487
No, it's not.

13:41.571 --> 13:44.198
You know, l think
l'm just going to
distill all of this

13:44.282 --> 13:46.158
and send it in
an e-mail to my team.

13:46.242 --> 13:49.578
E-mail's not scary.
This is an opportunity.
Don't blow it.

13:49.704 --> 13:51.413
So, when are you due?

13:51.664 --> 13:53.499
Uh, in about a month.

13:53.708 --> 13:56.543
Wow, that is wonderful.
Congratulations.

13:56.628 --> 13:59.421
Thank you. lt just
all happened so fast.

13:59.547 --> 14:01.673
lt's really amazing.
Congratulations, Karen.
Thanks.

14:02.258 --> 14:05.427
So is there a guy
or a person

14:06.304 --> 14:11.266
or a sperm machine
that did this to you or. . .

14:11.351 --> 14:14.311
Yes, Michael.
My husband impregnated me.

14:14.395 --> 14:15.521
Great.

14:15.980 --> 14:17.439
His name is Dan.

14:19.108 --> 14:21.235
This is us.
We're so dorky.
That's cute.

14:21.319 --> 14:22.694
Yes, thank you.

14:22.779 --> 14:26.365
He's a dermatologist.
We met at a bar.
Can you believe that?

14:27.617 --> 14:29.159
What is happening there?

14:29.244 --> 14:31.745
(BOTH LAUGHlNG)
Oh, yeah, don't even. . .
That's really dorky.

14:32.163 --> 14:33.163
lt's really sweet.

14:33.289 --> 14:34.581
No, it's really dorky.

14:34.666 --> 14:37.000
You were right
the first time.

14:37.126 --> 14:39.795
So how are things
in Scranton?
How's Jim?

14:39.879 --> 14:42.297
They're good.
Jim's good.

14:44.133 --> 14:45.634
We're engaged.

14:48.137 --> 14:50.389
That's so great.
That's great.

14:50.473 --> 14:51.932
Thank you.

14:52.016 --> 14:53.225
Oh, my God.
l'm so happy for you.

14:53.309 --> 14:54.476
Oh, wow. Thank you.

14:55.603 --> 14:59.231
Old hatreds dissolve
into new friendships.

14:59.649 --> 15:01.984
This is really
a wonderful moment.

15:07.156 --> 15:08.907
l have to take care
of a couple of things,

15:08.992 --> 15:11.243
so Andy will be
taking over things here.

15:11.327 --> 15:14.162
You are in good hands
and give my best
to your mother.

15:15.331 --> 15:19.876
So, Julia, um,
let's see.

15:20.670 --> 15:25.924
With regards to billing,
should we send bills

15:26.009 --> 15:28.594
to you or to your
boyfriend's house,
or. . .

15:28.678 --> 15:30.762
No, it can go straight
to our business address.

15:30.847 --> 15:33.849
Oh, okay. All right.
That makes sense.

15:33.933 --> 15:36.852
How does your boyfriend
deal with your phenomenal
success?

15:37.645 --> 15:40.397
ls he just, like,
totally threatened
by you, or. . .

15:40.481 --> 15:43.400
Actually, l don't
have a boyfriend.

15:43.818 --> 15:48.155
Really? ls that. . .
Wow, that's so weird.

15:49.574 --> 15:50.866
Guys, stop everything.

15:50.950 --> 15:53.577
l'm about to ask out
this girl and l'm
completely panicking.

15:53.661 --> 15:55.078
Oh, my desk
is over. . .

15:55.163 --> 15:57.331
This gal,
she's really into you?

15:57.415 --> 15:59.124
Yeah. Yeah, l mean,

15:59.208 --> 16:01.084
l've seen her like
three times today

16:01.169 --> 16:03.128
and we love
all the same music

16:03.212 --> 16:05.922
and whenever
l walk into a room
she totally looks up.

16:06.007 --> 16:10.052
All right, say no more.
This is how l got
Squeaky Fromme.

16:10.970 --> 16:14.514
No small talk.
Just show her
who's the boss.

16:14.599 --> 16:16.099
Just go right in
and kiss her.

16:16.184 --> 16:17.851
Okay, it sounds risky.

16:17.935 --> 16:20.479
Have l ever steered
you wrong, Jim?

16:21.397 --> 16:22.439
Wait, what?

16:22.940 --> 16:25.150
l would give
that lecture
a solid B-plus.

16:25.234 --> 16:29.029
Although, for the record,
Karen, wow, kind of mean.

16:29.238 --> 16:30.238
l like her.

16:30.323 --> 16:33.617
Really? No, honestly.
Tell me what you
really think.

16:34.035 --> 16:36.912
l'm serious.
l'm really glad l came.

16:37.372 --> 16:39.081
Why?

16:39.165 --> 16:40.582
Because, um. . .

16:42.669 --> 16:46.963
Because l'll never
wonder ever again
if l did something wrong,

16:48.883 --> 16:50.217
and now l have closure.

16:50.301 --> 16:51.927
She's happy,

16:52.261 --> 16:54.429
and, l don't know,
it feels good.

16:58.851 --> 17:00.018
Thanks for
walking me out.

17:00.103 --> 17:03.021
Oh, my pleasure.
Yeah, there's all kinds
of weirdoes out here, so. . .

17:03.106 --> 17:04.731
You must be freezing.

17:04.816 --> 17:07.275
l am about to die.

17:07.985 --> 17:09.861
Will you wait here
while l go get my jacket?

17:09.946 --> 17:11.863
No, it's okay.
This is my car.

17:11.948 --> 17:13.490
Okay. Okay.

17:13.616 --> 17:15.701
Well, listen,

17:15.785 --> 17:19.538
you're a new client
and as one of
my new clients

17:19.914 --> 17:22.040
you will always
be taken care of

17:22.125 --> 17:25.043
and that is
the Nard-Dog guarantee.

17:25.128 --> 17:27.003
What's a Nard-Dog?

17:27.088 --> 17:28.880
This is the Nard-Dog.

17:29.632 --> 17:31.717
Whoa! What the hell?

17:31.801 --> 17:32.968
Oh. . .

17:33.845 --> 17:36.138
l'm sorry. l'm sorry.

17:37.014 --> 17:39.307
l thought
we had this energy

17:39.392 --> 17:42.394
and l'm a mess
and l just had
my heart broken

17:42.937 --> 17:44.980
and you came in today
and you're so pretty.

17:45.064 --> 17:46.231
You're, like,
incredibly pretty.

17:46.315 --> 17:49.276
l just got out of
a relationship, too.
lt's really hard.

17:49.360 --> 17:51.611
Yeah, right? Wow.

17:52.572 --> 17:53.739
Do you want to
talk about it?

17:53.823 --> 17:55.532
Go to a mall or something,
just walk around?

17:55.616 --> 17:56.742
No, l don't think so.

17:56.826 --> 17:59.745
Sure, yeah,
you're right.
lt's too soon.

18:00.538 --> 18:02.539
Definitely too soon
for me,

18:02.623 --> 18:05.041
so l'm glad we got
that out of the way.

18:05.543 --> 18:07.335
l'm going to be in touch
with you in three months.

18:07.420 --> 18:09.588
l'm going to call you
about that order.

18:09.672 --> 18:11.673
And maybe
about that mall walk.

18:11.966 --> 18:12.966
Okay.

18:13.843 --> 18:14.843
Take care, Julia.

18:14.927 --> 18:16.011
Thank you.

18:21.768 --> 18:23.727
Sorry l tried
to kiss. . .

18:27.190 --> 18:28.857
We lost the account.

18:29.859 --> 18:31.443

JIM: How oId is KeIIy?

18:39.744 --> 18:40.744
Who is this?

18:40.828 --> 18:42.329
It's Mose.
Who do you think it is?

18:42.413 --> 18:44.915
Mose doesn't know
how to use a phone,
so joke's on you.

18:44.999 --> 18:47.292
Look, I'm at the supermarket
and they onIy have
numbered candIes.

18:47.376 --> 18:48.460
How oId is she?

18:48.544 --> 18:50.754
Twenty-four.
Thirty-seven.

18:51.130 --> 18:53.131
Do you think I'm caIIing you
for your best approximation?

18:53.216 --> 18:54.216
l'll call you back.

19:02.850 --> 19:06.019
l have here
Kelly Kapoor's personal
and confidential file.

19:06.187 --> 19:07.395
Allow me to share.

19:08.689 --> 19:12.526
"Kelly Kapoor

to December 1 996

19:18.032 --> 19:22.869
"According to past employers,
it in no way affects
her job. . ." Blah, blah, blah.

Are you asleep?

19:26.499 --> 19:27.707
No.

what you said.

About Karen,
about closure.

You remember Holly?
She used to work for HR.

love of my life.

have times a hundred.
Just. . . She. . .

She just left
and l didn't. . .

20:03.870 --> 20:05.370
l never got closure.

20:05.454 --> 20:07.455
You know? l never
got closure with her.

20:07.540 --> 20:10.750
l haven't talked to her since.
l haven't seen her since.

20:10.835 --> 20:14.337
And l feel like
l need to go to Nashua
and get closure.

20:14.422 --> 20:15.922
l feel like
l need that.

20:19.760 --> 20:22.220
Okay. Let's go.

Oh, just blow off
