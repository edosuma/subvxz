08:59.706 --> 09:03.375
My partner needs to ask you
some questions, chief.

09:04.510 --> 09:06.211
If you don't
cooperate with us, ma'am,

09:06.213 --> 09:07.479
We're gonna have
to take you

09:07.481 --> 09:09.347
Down to the station
for questioning.

09:10.316 --> 09:12.450
Don't you get it,
briggs?

09:12.452 --> 09:13.652
That's not chief.

09:13.654 --> 09:15.620
That's not chief one bit.

09:15.622 --> 09:16.888
That's a baboon.

09:16.890 --> 09:19.057
Chief: I won 10 large
at the track, monkey.

09:19.059 --> 09:20.926
Be back tomorrow
before post time.

09:20.928 --> 09:22.193
Crap.
Briggs:
Wait a minute.

09:22.195 --> 09:24.696
What's this money doing
at your desk?

09:24.698 --> 09:25.964
Okay, you got me.

09:25.966 --> 09:27.866
I dress up this baboon
to fill in for me

09:27.868 --> 09:29.034
When I go to the track.

09:29.036 --> 09:30.435
It's an old
chief surgeon's trick.

09:30.437 --> 09:32.938
I've been doing it
for 15 years.

09:32.940 --> 09:35.073
Your days of monkeying around
are over.

09:35.075 --> 09:38.310
Yeah. It's gonna be
a real hard day's night for you.

09:38.312 --> 09:39.511
Let it be.

09:39.513 --> 09:40.712
A baboon is so strong,

09:40.714 --> 09:43.515
They could tear a man's head
clean off his body.

09:43.517 --> 09:47.786
Which is exactly
what he's been doing...

09:47.788 --> 09:49.220
For 15 years.

09:50.923 --> 09:52.557
Isn't that right, fella?

[ squeaks ]

09:54.928 --> 09:56.661
And there's
your confession.

09:56.663 --> 09:57.562
Chief...

09:57.564 --> 09:59.297
You're in big trouble.

09:59.299 --> 10:00.498
Why?

10:00.500 --> 10:02.901
Is replacing yourself at work
with a monkey a crime?

10:02.903 --> 10:04.102
In iraq, yes.

10:04.104 --> 10:06.404
But not here, so...

10:06.406 --> 10:08.139
Actually, I guess
you're not in trouble.

10:08.141 --> 10:10.108
Great.
Thanks, guys.

10:13.679 --> 10:15.013
How did you figure it out?

10:15.015 --> 10:16.381
Sherlock holmes once said,

10:16.383 --> 10:18.416
"when you eliminate
the impossible,

10:18.418 --> 10:20.719
Whatever remains,
however improbable,

10:20.721 --> 10:22.921
Is most likely a monkey."

10:22.923 --> 10:25.423
It takes a baboon
to know a baboon.
