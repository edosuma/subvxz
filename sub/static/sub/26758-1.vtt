01:37.950 --> 01:40.250
- They say beauty is in
the eye of the beholder,

01:40.250 --> 01:42.890
and in this case, I am the beholder.

01:42.890 --> 01:46.140
I have my own idea of what
beauty is and what it isn't.

01:46.140 --> 01:48.890
We all make our own assessment
as to what is beautiful.

01:49.970 --> 01:52.840
And I choose to appreciate
artificial enhancement

01:52.840 --> 01:56.403
when what nature has given,
lacks in certain departments.

01:57.860 --> 01:59.850
I am Dr. Joseph Neiman and I'm a board

01:59.850 --> 02:01.760
certified plastic surgeon.

02:01.760 --> 02:04.177
I am considered one of
the best in the country.

02:05.190 --> 02:06.950
This is my facility.

02:06.950 --> 02:08.863
I have a staff of over 40 employees.

02:09.930 --> 02:11.900
I make dreams become reality.

02:11.900 --> 02:15.568
Shape patients into Instagram
and social media celebrities.

02:25.500 --> 02:27.650
Why did I want to become
a plastic surgeon?

02:28.570 --> 02:32.140
Obviously I wanted to make
an obnoxious amount of money.

02:32.140 --> 02:34.080
It's also said we're born into a world

02:34.080 --> 02:36.740
filled with so many imperfections.

02:36.740 --> 02:39.030
My job allows me to fix
some of those imperfections.

02:39.030 --> 02:40.500
I can find a flaw in any woman.

02:40.500 --> 02:42.160
Small tits, make 'em bigger.

02:42.160 --> 02:44.660
Fat, tuck it in or suck it out.

02:44.660 --> 02:45.920
Need a larger ass?

02:45.920 --> 02:48.683
Expand, reshape, and uplift it.

02:49.670 --> 02:51.060
People have always been widely obsessed

02:51.060 --> 02:53.330
with achieving the perfect look.

02:53.330 --> 02:55.480
Cosmetic surgery is the new drug

02:55.480 --> 02:56.680
and it's in high demand.

02:59.256 --> 03:01.006
I know, they call it a god complex.

03:02.400 --> 03:03.233
Why not?

03:04.780 --> 03:07.113
Who else can literally
change someones world?

03:08.670 --> 03:10.543
So yeah, I am god.

03:12.290 --> 03:15.157
I think it was Ayesha
Curry that once said,

03:15.157 --> 03:17.927
"Everyone is barely
wearing clothes these days.

03:17.927 --> 03:19.357
"Not my style.

03:19.357 --> 03:20.977
"I like to keep the good stuff covered up

03:20.977 --> 03:23.080
"for the one who matters."

03:23.080 --> 03:23.913
Well good for you.

03:23.913 --> 03:25.690
Whoop dee fucking doo.

03:25.690 --> 03:28.630
I need people to continue
showing their ass and tits.

03:28.630 --> 03:30.820
People feel insecure about themselves,

03:30.820 --> 03:31.783
they come see me.

03:32.758 --> 03:35.560
Being what I like to call normal,

03:35.560 --> 03:37.970
won't even get you through the door.

03:37.970 --> 03:41.130
However, beauty gives you
limitless possibilities.

03:41.130 --> 03:43.430
For example, I have it all.

03:43.430 --> 03:45.590
Money, prestige.

03:45.590 --> 03:47.540
I can pretty much get any woman I want.

03:48.390 --> 03:51.580
Then I can make her into
anyone my heart desires.

03:51.580 --> 03:54.723
I have the power to
create my own Mona Lisa.

03:55.610 --> 03:58.010
Only thing I can't seem to understand

03:58.010 --> 04:02.233
or get in return is love.

04:08.740 --> 04:10.360
So you wanna go bigger?

04:10.360 --> 04:11.790
- Of course bigger.

04:11.790 --> 04:13.923
Stella Stunner has a rep to maintain.

04:15.895 --> 04:18.839
- So we're talking
in a third person I see.

04:18.839 --> 04:21.190
- I'm losing ground with the fans of the

04:21.190 --> 04:23.210
Real Side Chicks Atlanta show ever since

04:23.210 --> 04:26.053
that bitch Tasty Tee got her bigger tits.

04:27.670 --> 04:29.250
That little birdie been tricking attention

04:29.250 --> 04:30.790
from the producers and I'm not happy

04:30.790 --> 04:32.590
about that dumb shit.

04:32.590 --> 04:34.010
Word on the street is she need to get

04:34.010 --> 04:35.283
her head game up though.

04:36.240 --> 04:38.370
Weak as fuck from what I hear.

04:38.370 --> 04:40.060
Not like the queen though.

04:40.060 --> 04:42.260
No gag reflex.

04:42.260 --> 04:43.100
- Makes sense.

04:43.100 --> 04:46.160
- I want them to stand
out a lot more on camera.

04:46.160 --> 04:47.970
The camera adds pounds to your waste

04:47.970 --> 04:49.750
but takes a cup off your tits.

04:49.750 --> 04:50.973
I need more.

05:00.710 --> 05:03.100
- Hey, what's up Mallory, how ya doing?

05:03.100 --> 05:04.570
- Hello, how ya doing Jeremiah?

05:04.570 --> 05:05.403
- Doing great.

05:05.403 --> 05:08.210
- Don't let society or the media

05:08.210 --> 05:10.060
brainwash you into thinking

05:10.060 --> 05:11.990
that you have to be reconstructed

05:11.990 --> 05:13.693
in order to be beautiful!

05:14.690 --> 05:18.454
Embrace what God has given you!

05:25.660 --> 05:28.040
- Mallory, could you deliver
this to Summer for me?

05:28.040 --> 05:29.040
- Sure, no problem.

05:29.040 --> 05:30.340
- Cool, Thanks.

05:44.940 --> 05:47.047
- Hey Summer,
here's the breast implants.

05:47.047 --> 05:48.884
- Perfect, thank you.

05:50.860 --> 05:53.010
Dr. Neiman, there are protesters outside.

05:53.010 --> 05:53.843
What do you wanna do?

05:53.843 --> 05:55.350
- What the fuck Summer?

05:55.350 --> 05:57.370
Can't you see I'm busy here?

05:57.370 --> 05:58.730
What's wrong with you, you gotta knock.

05:58.730 --> 06:00.190
- Yeah, that's not gonna happen.

06:00.190 --> 06:02.630
What do you wanna do, release a statement?

06:02.630 --> 06:03.713
- What protestors?

06:05.360 --> 06:07.890
- Those people who hate the
whole plastic surgery thing.

06:07.890 --> 06:09.260
They used to just trash us online

06:09.260 --> 06:12.160
but now they're organized
and lined up outside.

06:12.160 --> 06:13.680
- I don't know, why don't you go buy them

06:13.680 --> 06:15.010
some coffee, some donuts, show them how

06:15.010 --> 06:16.704
classy I am alright?

06:16.704 --> 06:17.704
I don't give a shit.

06:19.180 --> 06:21.114
- Hey Stella, how ya doing?

06:21.114 --> 06:22.420
- Trying to get there.

06:22.420 --> 06:24.350
- Sorry about the interruption.

06:24.350 --> 06:26.640
Oh Dr. Neiman, your next
appointment is here.

06:26.640 --> 06:28.720
- Hey, tell Mallory to take her vitals.

06:28.720 --> 06:29.670
Properly this time.

06:30.654 --> 06:32.304
- Don't tell me how to do my job.

06:37.310 --> 06:39.633
- I love the smell of
saline in the morning.

06:40.480 --> 06:43.360
Watching these transactions
gives me a hard on.

06:43.360 --> 06:45.040
Although I always thought it was odd

06:45.040 --> 06:48.290
that the strippers never pay
with a check or a credit card.

06:48.290 --> 06:50.190
It's like they come straight from the job

06:50.190 --> 06:52.690
and pay in weed smelling sweaty bills.

06:52.690 --> 06:54.447
Don't get me wrong, money is money,

06:54.447 --> 06:55.650
but get a bank account.

06:55.650 --> 06:59.090
I mean you make upwards
of 50 or 75 grand a year,

06:59.090 --> 07:01.690
you really shouldn't be
keeping it under a mattress.

07:03.330 --> 07:06.350
You're interested in getting
more procedures done yes?

07:06.350 --> 07:08.640
- I gotta stay ahead of the curve.

07:08.640 --> 07:10.790
I gotta always be in
front of these chicks.

07:11.830 --> 07:13.320
- Well I think you're doing great.

07:13.320 --> 07:14.570
- Always room to improve.

07:15.920 --> 07:18.870
So, what should I make a priority?

07:18.870 --> 07:20.290
- I know what you're thinking.

07:20.290 --> 07:22.580
Don't judge, this stuff
helps me keep focus

07:22.580 --> 07:25.100
so I can fly through a surgery in minutes.

07:25.100 --> 07:27.080
Cocaine is like a Red Bull.

07:27.080 --> 07:27.950
Only much better.

07:27.950 --> 07:31.623
- Dr. Neiman, my husband is scared to go,

07:33.050 --> 07:34.943
you know, down there.

07:36.010 --> 07:39.020
- What real man doesn't
like to eat the pudding cup?

07:39.020 --> 07:40.760
Maybe you got the wrong doctor?

07:40.760 --> 07:43.180
Couples therapy, better option maybe?

07:43.180 --> 07:44.960
- I don't think you understand.

07:44.960 --> 07:47.913
I mean, he doesn't like the way it looks.

07:49.095 --> 07:50.350
- You mean that this just happened?

07:50.350 --> 07:52.140
Did he know this before y'all got married?

07:52.140 --> 07:53.183
I mean I'm confused.

08:05.320 --> 08:06.700
Alright.

08:06.700 --> 08:08.220
I have to be honest with you.

08:08.220 --> 08:10.100
I thought I'd seen everything.

08:10.100 --> 08:12.400
Please put that away
before you get arrested.

08:12.400 --> 08:15.320
Hell, before I get arrested

08:15.320 --> 08:17.920
for allowing a saber-tooth tiger in here.

08:17.920 --> 08:19.420
- So you see what I mean then?

08:20.710 --> 08:23.660
- Labiaplasty would probably
be your saving grace.

08:23.660 --> 08:25.643
- What exactly is labiaplasty?

08:26.610 --> 08:29.290
- Alright, I'm not the best artist,

08:29.290 --> 08:32.083
but try to bare with me here.

08:32.083 --> 08:36.049
Vagina's, they come in many
different shapes and sizes.

08:36.049 --> 08:37.653
Kind of like a 7-11 cup right.

08:38.530 --> 08:40.780
You got small, you got
medium, you got large.

08:42.990 --> 08:43.823
Then,

08:45.300 --> 08:46.133
you,

08:53.381 --> 08:55.048
you have a Big Gulp.

08:56.170 --> 08:58.570
- Beauty comes from the inside.

08:58.570 --> 09:02.053
Beauty comes from nature, not a knife.

09:02.930 --> 09:03.860
- Hey.

09:03.860 --> 09:06.130
A courtesy of Dr. Neiman.

09:06.130 --> 09:08.380
He knows how hard protests
are to keep alive.

09:10.440 --> 09:14.488
- The problem is standing right behind me.

09:14.488 --> 09:16.424
This is an enabler.

09:16.424 --> 09:17.529
- Enabler!

09:17.529 --> 09:18.804
Enabler!

09:18.804 --> 09:19.860
Enabler!

09:19.860 --> 09:21.810
- Daily, I get the neurotic female

09:21.810 --> 09:24.120
who wants a miracle performed.

09:24.120 --> 09:26.220
Says here you want to look like Lady Gaga.

09:28.383 --> 09:30.360
- I just, I don't understand

09:31.490 --> 09:33.340
why you don't want to see me anymore.

09:34.204 --> 09:38.641
- Come on Talia, big
girls don't cry right?

09:38.641 --> 09:39.474
- You think I'm fat?

09:43.990 --> 09:46.400
- Wanna be reality stars, exotic dancers,

09:46.400 --> 09:48.420
and potential sugar babies make up a huge

09:48.420 --> 09:49.900
portion of my business.

09:49.900 --> 09:51.410
Only in America right?

09:51.410 --> 09:54.400
- So I come to the part
and I see that bitch Stella

09:54.400 --> 09:56.003
all hugged up with Dirty D.

09:57.310 --> 09:59.760
Bitch, what you doing in
here with my fucking man?

09:59.760 --> 10:01.508
That's my man.

10:01.508 --> 10:03.093
I'm his number one side chick.

10:03.960 --> 10:05.525
What the fuck you doing with my man?

10:05.525 --> 10:07.111
- You lost your god damn mind?

10:07.111 --> 10:10.230
Come on, who wouldn't wanna be with this.

10:10.230 --> 10:12.850
I'm the number one side chick, period.

10:12.850 --> 10:15.163
- Listen, y'all
don't have to fight over me!

10:20.970 --> 10:21.803
Hey!

10:22.840 --> 10:24.290
- I'm from B More bitch!

10:24.290 --> 10:25.750
Don't you know we don't play that?

10:25.750 --> 10:28.790
Trifling chicks step up to get beat down!

10:28.790 --> 10:31.860
- I'm an equal opportunity type practice.

10:31.860 --> 10:33.230
I mainly service females,

10:33.230 --> 10:35.290
but when I do see a male client

10:35.290 --> 10:38.050
they are here for a specific need.

10:38.050 --> 10:40.410
So, are you okay with the pectoral implant

10:40.410 --> 10:41.543
arrangements Mr. Mac?

10:46.340 --> 10:48.940
Fasten your seat belts,
here comes the number one

10:48.940 --> 10:51.210
question I always get from men.

10:51.210 --> 10:53.823
Three, two, one.

10:55.120 --> 10:58.500
- So doctor, do you do...

11:03.173 --> 11:04.790
- The chart you requested.

11:04.790 --> 11:06.138
- Thanks.

11:06.138 --> 11:07.683
- The force is strong with this one.

11:15.040 --> 11:16.410
- So Charlie, spit it out.

11:16.410 --> 11:18.000
What else you wanna ask me?

11:18.000 --> 11:21.623
- Do you do enlargements?

11:23.350 --> 11:25.090
- You mean your cock, your dick,

11:25.090 --> 11:26.900
your schlong, your meat stick?

11:26.900 --> 11:27.910
Is that what you're referencing?

11:27.910 --> 11:29.540
- I tried everything.

11:29.540 --> 11:33.290
Creams, pills, pumps,

11:33.290 --> 11:35.363
got a bad rash after the last one.

11:36.280 --> 11:37.640
- Unfortunately, there's not a whole lot

11:37.640 --> 11:40.100
we can do for, you know,

11:40.100 --> 11:41.310
to enlarge penis size.

11:41.310 --> 11:43.583
The one they do have is very very painful.

11:44.780 --> 11:46.890
- I'm willing to make that sacrifice.

11:46.890 --> 11:47.743
- Sorry Charlie.

11:48.700 --> 11:49.993
- So there's nothing you can do?

11:49.993 --> 11:53.080
- Come on, don't you
think if it was that easy

11:53.080 --> 11:56.570
every guy would be walking
around with a 12 inch dick?

11:56.570 --> 11:58.610
Best advice I can give you is

11:58.610 --> 12:00.530
learn a few tricks in the bedroom.

12:00.530 --> 12:01.560
Maybe lose some weight.

12:01.560 --> 12:03.120
- Lose some weight?

12:03.120 --> 12:04.673
- It makes your dick look bigger.

12:05.620 --> 12:07.170
- Hey Dr. Neiman,

12:07.170 --> 12:09.330
the leader of People
Against Plastic Surgery

12:09.330 --> 12:10.620
would like to meet you.

12:10.620 --> 12:14.000
- Summer you continue to
ignore the memo about knocking.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.910
- Should I set up a time?

12:15.910 --> 12:16.743
- 10 years.

12:17.740 --> 12:19.490
10 years and you still can't knock?

12:19.490 --> 12:21.190
- Well let's see, you eat all the lunches

12:21.190 --> 12:22.653
I leave in the refrigerator,

12:31.630 --> 12:33.400
you have sex with your clients in every

12:33.400 --> 12:34.951
space available here.

12:43.740 --> 12:45.090
Oh, should I go one with the list

12:45.090 --> 12:47.483
of privacy acts broken by you?

12:47.483 --> 12:50.480
- You know, I should fire
you for your insubordination.

12:50.480 --> 12:52.117
- Yeah, but you won't.

12:52.117 --> 12:55.410
You know how indispensable
I am around here.

12:55.410 --> 12:57.540
Plus, I have so much dirt on this place

12:57.540 --> 12:59.590
I could shut it down with one phone call.

13:01.692 --> 13:02.790
- What do you want?

13:02.790 --> 13:03.750
- Two things.

13:03.750 --> 13:04.850
Would you like me to set up something

13:04.850 --> 13:06.070
with the leader of PAPS?

13:06.070 --> 13:08.792
The other doctors in the
building are concerned.

13:08.792 --> 13:09.625
- No.

13:09.625 --> 13:12.740
And tell those wussies
to man up, get a grip.

13:12.740 --> 13:14.120
- Lovely.

13:14.120 --> 13:17.470
Okay, secondly, Carolyn
in billing has a question.

13:17.470 --> 13:19.917
She said, and I quote, "Tell Dr. Neiman's

13:19.917 --> 13:21.610
"pussy ass to get down here."

13:21.610 --> 13:22.990
- Why do I have to be a pussy ass?

13:22.990 --> 13:25.000
- You're gonna have to
dig that up with her.

13:25.000 --> 13:26.320
Good luck.

13:26.320 --> 13:28.180
Oh, also, I'm leaving a
little bit early today.

13:28.180 --> 13:29.680
I have some errands to run before Richards

13:29.680 --> 13:31.696
parents get in town tonight.

13:31.696 --> 13:33.746
I have this Italian dish I'm making them.

13:34.882 --> 13:37.320
- You know, it's really
adorable, the way you

13:37.320 --> 13:39.790
are trying to impress
your boyfriends parents.

13:39.790 --> 13:40.623
Now do me a favor.

13:40.623 --> 13:41.456
You see this pen?

13:43.380 --> 13:45.390
Make it disappear in my eye,

13:45.390 --> 13:47.710
like the joker in that Batman movie.

13:47.710 --> 13:50.740
- You're a sad man Dr. Neiman.

13:50.740 --> 13:52.862
Maybe you should start dating again.

13:52.862 --> 13:53.695
- What are you talking about?

13:53.695 --> 13:54.830
I date all the time, you know that.

13:54.830 --> 13:57.220
- I'm not talking about
your strippers with benefits

13:57.220 --> 13:58.540
or one night specials.

13:58.540 --> 14:00.716
I mean a real date with a real woman.

14:00.716 --> 14:02.420
- Summer there is a fine
line between employer

14:02.420 --> 14:05.043
and employee, you're crossing it.

14:05.901 --> 14:07.751
- Think about what I said Dr. Neiman.

14:10.530 --> 14:11.430
- Summer.

14:16.600 --> 14:18.580
Ah, the Billing Department.

14:18.580 --> 14:22.000
The most ruthless, lawless,
area of my practice.

14:22.000 --> 14:25.040
You remember that extra $300
on your medical statement

14:25.040 --> 14:27.840
for that cup of water that
you so desperately needed?

14:27.840 --> 14:31.030
Well, that bill was processed here.

14:31.030 --> 14:32.843
We charge you for everything.

14:33.690 --> 14:35.440
You wanna use WiFi?

14:35.440 --> 14:37.330
We're going to bill you.

14:37.330 --> 14:40.400
You wanna use our electric
to charge your smartphone?

14:40.400 --> 14:41.800
You're gonna get a bill.

14:41.800 --> 14:45.280
Nothing is free, nothing
gets passed these guys.

14:45.280 --> 14:49.690
- Ma'am, I do not make the
rules for your insurance policy.

14:49.690 --> 14:52.130
- This is where all the money is.

14:52.130 --> 14:54.280
The central nervous
system of my operation.

14:55.230 --> 14:57.093
Most of my patients, they pay cash,

14:58.170 --> 15:00.623
get a loan, sell their first born.

15:01.860 --> 15:03.140
- Talk to your insurance company

15:03.140 --> 15:04.790
if you don't like their decision.

15:06.090 --> 15:08.060
Well in the meantime I need payment.

15:08.060 --> 15:09.700
- I don't really care how they pay.

15:09.700 --> 15:12.120
As long as I see the money
rolling in I'm happy.

15:12.120 --> 15:14.550
Carolyn here, she makes it all happen.

15:14.550 --> 15:17.840
- I'm calling on behalf of
patient Charlotte O'Connor.

15:17.840 --> 15:21.780
- Insurance companies, pain
in the ass to deal with.

15:21.780 --> 15:23.460
They never wanna pay out.

15:23.460 --> 15:26.040
Especially not for cosmetic surgeries.

15:26.040 --> 15:26.873
Bastards.

15:26.873 --> 15:28.930
- Alright, let's cut to the chase.

15:28.930 --> 15:31.743
Will the insurance cover the
surgery or will they not?

15:32.800 --> 15:34.010
What?

15:34.010 --> 15:35.670
Fuck me?

15:35.670 --> 15:36.593
No, fuck you.

15:37.650 --> 15:38.630
Piece of shit.

15:40.880 --> 15:41.713
Neiman.

15:44.020 --> 15:45.250
Surprised to see you here.

15:45.250 --> 15:49.040
- I apologize Carolyn, I
actually have patients to see.

15:49.040 --> 15:52.060
- How do you want to handle
Bryan Mitchell's tummy tuck?

15:52.060 --> 15:54.380
- Bryan has a hernia.

15:54.380 --> 15:56.050
If he doesn't get it
taken care of right away,

15:56.050 --> 15:58.880
it might be detrimental down the line.

15:58.880 --> 16:01.380
- Bullshit Neiman.

16:01.380 --> 16:03.730
You and I both know Bryan Mitchell's

16:03.730 --> 16:05.363
fat ass doesn't have a hernia.

16:06.340 --> 16:09.802
I work with you long enough
to know your shenanigans.

16:12.260 --> 16:13.093
What!

16:13.990 --> 16:16.313
- So I bend the rules a little.

16:17.300 --> 16:20.230
I write down in my notes one thing

16:20.230 --> 16:22.390
and she bills it under
a different medical code

16:22.390 --> 16:24.490
to get the insurance companies to ante up.

16:25.480 --> 16:26.313
Is it legal?

16:27.220 --> 16:28.920
Strictly speaking, probably not.

16:28.920 --> 16:31.173
- Well I'm glad we can
come to an understanding.

16:35.840 --> 16:36.950
So we'll bill that code.

16:36.950 --> 16:38.473
I just needed your approval.

16:40.220 --> 16:41.173
You can leave now.

16:43.380 --> 16:45.670
- Quicker I can escape, the better.

16:45.670 --> 16:48.223
Helps me forget the medical
fraud I just sanctioned.

17:17.930 --> 17:18.992
- Nice magazine.

17:20.380 --> 17:23.410
I'm sure you're just browsing
for the great articles right?

17:23.410 --> 17:24.780
- Right.

17:24.780 --> 17:26.863
Actually, the articles are pretty shit.

17:27.839 --> 17:30.020
But I do like looking at naked women.

17:30.020 --> 17:30.853
- Nice.

17:34.044 --> 17:35.877
Could you please move?

17:40.844 --> 17:44.740
- I see your breasts are fairly average.

17:44.740 --> 17:46.470
- Compared to the ones
you were just looking at,

17:46.470 --> 17:48.923
Dolly Partons tits are rather average.

17:50.680 --> 17:51.880
- I'm a plastic surgeon.

17:52.740 --> 17:54.480
If you ever decide to get some work done,

17:54.480 --> 17:56.753
especially your breasts, give me a shout.

17:56.753 --> 17:59.060
I'll give you a free consultation.

17:59.060 --> 18:01.483
- Well, Dr. Joseph Neiman,

18:02.540 --> 18:04.600
there are several ways
that I could respond

18:04.600 --> 18:06.680
to such inappropriateness,

18:06.680 --> 18:08.650
but I'll keep it simple.

18:08.650 --> 18:09.843
You're an asshole.

18:10.810 --> 18:13.100
- Anyway, love to
continue this little chat

18:13.100 --> 18:13.933
but I gotta go.

18:21.288 --> 18:23.038
Here keep the change.

18:26.960 --> 18:28.690
- Well doc, you know why I'm here.

18:28.690 --> 18:31.160
I mean my body is my business.

18:31.160 --> 18:32.340
- And business is good right?

18:32.340 --> 18:33.740
- Well, it could be better.

18:33.740 --> 18:35.250
I wanna go bigger.

18:35.250 --> 18:37.593
- Well if you're
comfortable, you know I am.

18:38.500 --> 18:39.800
- I'm more than comfortable.

18:39.800 --> 18:41.960
Everybody wants to see my train wreck.

18:41.960 --> 18:44.620
- Listen, all they need to know

18:44.620 --> 18:46.420
is that you're just getting started.

19:00.660 --> 19:01.493
Alright.

19:02.930 --> 19:05.863
Numbing cream should be
taking effect any minute.

19:10.150 --> 19:11.563
You're not gonna feel a thing.

19:14.400 --> 19:16.890
- Babe, you know how I hate needles.

19:16.890 --> 19:17.723
Hold my hand.

19:19.040 --> 19:21.700
- You two ever think about upgrading?

19:21.700 --> 19:24.100
- Keshia thinks more than
a mouthful is a waste.

19:25.002 --> 19:26.950
- The more the merrier
is what I always say.

19:26.950 --> 19:27.800
Bigger is better.

19:28.886 --> 19:31.070
- Why do men always think
that bigger is better?

19:31.070 --> 19:33.970
- I didn't say there's anything
wrong with just a handful.

19:35.250 --> 19:38.730
All I'm saying is I respect
those that go the extra mile.

19:38.730 --> 19:41.620
You're not gonna tell your
boss to pay you less are you?

19:41.620 --> 19:44.360
But, you know, today
we're talking about lips.

19:44.360 --> 19:46.623
Injecting yours, making them fuller.

19:47.600 --> 19:50.243
You know, one might even say
we're making them bigger.

19:51.400 --> 19:52.233
You ready?

19:56.860 --> 19:59.080
- Women are not for decoration.

19:59.080 --> 20:00.970
We are not objects to be sliced,

20:00.970 --> 20:05.430
and diced, and picked apart
for your ideal of beauty.

20:05.430 --> 20:06.990
- Dr. Neiman this is Rainbow Drake.

20:06.990 --> 20:09.100
She's leading the protest outside.

20:09.100 --> 20:11.440
- It's a pleasure to meet you sir.

20:11.440 --> 20:12.273
- To what do I owe this pleasure?

20:12.273 --> 20:13.810
- I just wanted to let you know

20:13.810 --> 20:15.430
not to take this protest personally

20:15.430 --> 20:17.990
and we will not be bribed by you.

20:17.990 --> 20:19.820
- Oh I'm not taking it personally at all.

20:19.820 --> 20:21.751
I actually think your little agenda

20:21.751 --> 20:23.840
is going to be really good for business.

20:23.840 --> 20:27.390
- You have no sense of
responsibility for your actions?

20:27.390 --> 20:29.054
- Of course I do.

20:29.054 --> 20:31.630
If my client needs
something I give it to them.

20:31.630 --> 20:33.420
Sometimes a little extra.

20:33.420 --> 20:34.770
It was nice talking to you.

20:37.280 --> 20:39.690
- Hey, I know you're busy son,

20:39.690 --> 20:41.680
but we're having an anniversary party

20:41.680 --> 20:42.830
and I want you to come.

20:43.760 --> 20:46.302
Give me a call please when you're free.

20:46.302 --> 20:47.719
I love you Jo Jo.

20:55.643 --> 20:57.720
- I love keeping Dirty D happy.

20:57.720 --> 20:58.553
Why?

20:58.553 --> 21:01.140
Well, he's never late with the bill,

21:01.140 --> 21:02.800
takes me on shopping sprees,

21:02.800 --> 21:05.487
and we take trips to Miami on the regular.

21:05.487 --> 21:07.257
- I have a wife at home,

21:07.257 --> 21:09.980
and she will always be my babe.

21:09.980 --> 21:13.210
I mean that is my wife, but Stella,

21:13.210 --> 21:15.155
now Stella is fun.

21:15.155 --> 21:17.170
And I love to have me some fun.

21:17.170 --> 21:19.170
We really don't have anything in common.

21:21.830 --> 21:23.950
Technically we don't
have nothing in common.

21:23.950 --> 21:26.893
But that girl body is banging!

21:38.900 --> 21:41.150
- Hey Jen, it's Neiman.

21:41.150 --> 21:42.160
- Oh, hey sweetie.

21:42.160 --> 21:43.270
- Can I schedule Susan?

21:43.270 --> 21:45.090
- Yeah sure, for when?

21:45.090 --> 21:46.090
- Tonight.

21:46.090 --> 21:47.910
- She's actually out tonight.

21:47.910 --> 21:50.370
The earliest I could get you in is

21:50.370 --> 21:51.860
tomorrow evening.

21:51.860 --> 21:52.693
I'm sorry honey.

22:07.520 --> 22:08.353
- Hey.

22:08.353 --> 22:10.210
I have somebody I want you to meet.

22:10.210 --> 22:12.590
- Summer, will you go down to receiving

22:12.590 --> 22:14.230
and see if the Botox arrived?

22:14.230 --> 22:15.470
- You igging me?

22:15.470 --> 22:16.320
- Come again?

22:16.320 --> 22:17.153
- Ignoring me.

22:18.580 --> 22:19.570
- Yes I'm ignoring you.

22:19.570 --> 22:22.963
- Look, I have somebody
that is perfect for you.

22:24.510 --> 22:25.860
- I highly doubt that
I would be interested

22:25.860 --> 22:28.040
in anybody that you would
hook me up with Summer.

22:28.040 --> 22:30.610
- She has an incredible
personality, she's amazing.

22:30.610 --> 22:31.860
- I'm not interested.

22:31.860 --> 22:34.760
- Okay, at least let me show
you a picture of her alright.

22:36.760 --> 22:38.110
This will change your mind.

22:41.240 --> 22:42.236
- Are you serious?

22:42.236 --> 22:43.069
- Yeah.

22:43.069 --> 22:44.150
- Alright, first of all, do you see how

22:44.150 --> 22:46.329
elongated her chin is?

22:46.329 --> 22:47.162
- What?

22:47.162 --> 22:48.720
- Yeah, and her left breast
is bigger than the right one.

22:48.720 --> 22:49.600
No thanks.

22:49.600 --> 22:51.207
- Are you serious?

22:51.207 --> 22:52.840
- Yeah.

22:52.840 --> 22:54.680
Actually, you know what, I change my mind.

22:54.680 --> 22:56.460
Bring her in for a consultation.

22:56.460 --> 23:00.400
And make sure I schedule at
least two hours with her.

23:00.400 --> 23:01.850
- Hey, Dr. Russell come here.

23:04.630 --> 23:06.033
What do you think of this woman?

23:07.819 --> 23:09.180
- Wow.

23:09.180 --> 23:10.680
- Yeah that's what I said.

23:10.680 --> 23:11.960
She's a project.

23:11.960 --> 23:13.770
- Oh man I'd love to hit that from behind

23:13.770 --> 23:15.510
and use her ass as an ashtray.

23:15.510 --> 23:17.290
Holy cow she's sexy.

23:17.290 --> 23:18.860
- Disgusting.

23:18.860 --> 23:21.030
Okay see Dr. Neiman, you're completely

23:21.030 --> 23:22.663
oblivious to what sexy is.

23:23.560 --> 23:24.480
- Who is this jail bait?

23:24.480 --> 23:26.170
- This girlfriend of mine that I was

23:26.170 --> 23:28.110
trying to hook Dr. Neiman up with but he

23:28.110 --> 23:30.260
turned me down like an idiot.

23:30.260 --> 23:31.590
- Joseph, you turned down this

23:31.590 --> 23:33.673
once in a lifetime opportunity?

23:33.673 --> 23:34.860
I mean, I would let this girl give me

23:34.860 --> 23:36.495
syphilis she's that beautiful.

23:36.495 --> 23:38.400
- Why don't you just
look at the picture Mike.

23:38.400 --> 23:39.800
- I am, and I'm telling you,

23:39.800 --> 23:42.864
I would dry hump her until
my pants caught on fire.

23:42.864 --> 23:45.740
- Look, all I see is a long ass face,

23:45.740 --> 23:47.840
weird breasts.

23:47.840 --> 23:49.360
If you can call them that.

23:49.360 --> 23:50.800
- What?

23:50.800 --> 23:53.560
- This girl is absolutely beautiful.

23:53.560 --> 23:54.860
Even I would have to drug her so

23:54.860 --> 23:56.010
she'd have sex with me.

23:57.032 --> 23:58.182
You know, pull a Cosby.

23:59.290 --> 24:00.123
Allegedly.

24:01.290 --> 24:03.780
Look, I didn't go through
all those years of Med school

24:03.780 --> 24:05.680
just to become an anesthesiologist.

24:05.680 --> 24:06.870
- Gross.

24:06.870 --> 24:08.363
I'm reporting you to HR.

24:10.240 --> 24:12.390
Look, Dr. Neiman just
think about it, okay?

24:15.320 --> 24:16.703
- Yeah, no thank you Summer.

24:16.703 --> 24:18.600
That picture is already
gonna give me nightmares,

24:18.600 --> 24:20.573
imagine what she's gonna
do to me in person.

24:39.470 --> 24:43.800
- Hey doc, so how is she?

24:43.800 --> 24:45.090
- You mean what does her breast look like?

24:45.090 --> 24:46.260
- Yeah.

24:46.260 --> 24:47.450
- You want the truth?

24:47.450 --> 24:49.060
- Absolutely.

24:49.060 --> 24:51.380
- I turned your wife
into a hot piece of ass.

24:51.380 --> 24:52.790
And I don't think she's gonna be hanging

24:52.790 --> 24:54.410
out with you much longer.

24:54.410 --> 24:55.970
Especially not after she starts getting a

24:55.970 --> 24:57.670
lot more attention from other men.

24:58.950 --> 24:59.783
No offense.

25:01.010 --> 25:04.253
Don't worry, you're an
average looking guy.

25:05.410 --> 25:07.530
Average income, I'm pretty sure somebody

25:07.530 --> 25:09.953
will scoop you up after a messy divorce.

25:10.910 --> 25:13.460
She's just not gonna be as
hot as your wife is now.

25:16.590 --> 25:18.510
- Congratulations, you're officially

25:18.510 --> 25:20.300
the biggest jerk off I've ever known.

25:20.300 --> 25:21.690
- I'm the asshole?

25:21.690 --> 25:24.824
He asked me to tell him
the truth, I did that.

25:24.824 --> 25:27.030
- You could've put it
a little differently.

25:27.030 --> 25:29.180
- Remind to me to tell you
about UNLV back in the hay day.

25:29.180 --> 25:30.960
- Can't wait to hear about that one.

25:30.960 --> 25:33.169
Hey, I've got your Botox
for your two o'clock.

25:34.002 --> 25:34.910
- Put it in the fridge Summer.

25:34.910 --> 25:35.743
Do your job.

25:36.823 --> 25:38.990
- I know how to do my job.

25:44.980 --> 25:47.270
- My father, Marine Sergeant Neiman.

25:47.270 --> 25:49.933
Retired, still a tough son of a bitch.

25:51.220 --> 25:53.250
Well, except when it comes to my mom.

25:53.250 --> 25:56.403
He's a pussy when it comes
to his relationship with her.

25:56.403 --> 25:57.240
And I haven't seen him in a while.

25:57.240 --> 25:58.730
I hope he's not here to kick my ass

25:58.730 --> 26:00.130
for not returning his calls.

26:07.309 --> 26:08.730
Dad.

26:08.730 --> 26:09.653
- Joseph.

26:17.643 --> 26:19.620
- What are you doing here dad?

26:19.620 --> 26:24.290
- Well, been trying to contact
you about your mother and I

26:24.290 --> 26:25.810
anniversary celebration.

26:25.810 --> 26:27.350
Since you won't answer the phone I was

26:27.350 --> 26:29.000
gonna send a messenger pigeon,

26:29.000 --> 26:30.750
but I thought what the heck.

26:30.750 --> 26:32.183
Come see my only son.

26:33.240 --> 26:34.950
- Yeah I'm sorry dad.

26:34.950 --> 26:36.770
I've just been busy.

26:36.770 --> 26:40.367
- Yeah I can see, you're
running a successful practice.

26:40.367 --> 26:43.420
I see how you're busy
and in the fast lane.

26:43.420 --> 26:44.560
Hey, by the way, I've been keeping up

26:44.560 --> 26:46.980
with the Real Side Chicks of Atlanta.

26:46.980 --> 26:48.348
Stella.

26:48.348 --> 26:49.911
Wow.

26:49.911 --> 26:50.970
You did a great job with her.

26:50.970 --> 26:52.740
- Her ratings jumped through the roof

26:52.740 --> 26:54.850
after she met these magical hands.

26:54.850 --> 26:55.800
- Proud of you son.

26:58.600 --> 26:59.963
Living the American dream.

27:01.340 --> 27:02.540
- I appreciate that dad.

27:03.840 --> 27:06.103
But you're not here to
talk about reality TV.

27:07.330 --> 27:09.493
- I want you to come to
our anniversary party.

27:11.620 --> 27:14.040
- I'm not sure if I can make that.

27:14.040 --> 27:17.340
I'm booked with patients
months in advance.

27:17.340 --> 27:19.800
- It would mean a lot
to your mother and I.

27:19.800 --> 27:22.260
I know she's never been mom of the year,

27:22.260 --> 27:24.863
and you two don't see
eye to eye on anything,

27:26.495 --> 27:27.945
but she really loves you son.

27:29.760 --> 27:31.910
- How about we just don't
get started on that dad.

27:31.910 --> 27:33.960
I mean, don't you see how fucked up I am?

27:35.503 --> 27:38.350
I mean if I had a shrink, we both know

27:38.350 --> 27:40.240
where the blame would lie.

27:40.240 --> 27:43.183
Maybe that's cliche but in
my case it would be true.

27:46.180 --> 27:47.830
When you were off fighting a war,

27:49.310 --> 27:52.783
mom was unhappy for whatever reason.

27:53.690 --> 27:55.080
Always going under the knife

27:55.080 --> 27:56.930
trying to look like she's in her 20s.

27:58.940 --> 28:00.423
Involved with other men.

28:01.530 --> 28:03.530
We were never quite good enough were we?

28:04.770 --> 28:05.603
No.

28:09.290 --> 28:11.933
She passed, she pushed my
past my breaking point dad.

28:13.690 --> 28:15.753
- Your mom, yes,

28:16.720 --> 28:19.723
she could bring out the worst in a person.

28:22.290 --> 28:24.190
I know she's been all hard on you son.

28:26.750 --> 28:28.730
But she did it in her way

28:28.730 --> 28:30.683
to make you a better person.

28:33.260 --> 28:34.360
- It's not better dad.

28:35.370 --> 28:38.550
She wanted me to be perfect
and I couldn't be that for her.

28:38.550 --> 28:39.383
- Joseph,

28:41.620 --> 28:43.490
people do change you know.

28:43.490 --> 28:45.800
You of all people should know that.

28:45.800 --> 28:47.543
Hell, it's what you do!

28:49.180 --> 28:50.620
The one thing that hasn't changed is the

28:50.620 --> 28:51.973
fact that you're our son.

28:53.120 --> 28:53.953
We love you.

28:55.030 --> 28:56.117
We both love you.

28:59.350 --> 29:01.350
I could understand if you can't make it.

29:03.326 --> 29:05.293
But I'd really love to
see you there Jo Jo.

29:16.922 --> 29:18.110
- We have choices in life.

29:18.110 --> 29:20.350
And plastic surgery is a smart choice.

29:20.350 --> 29:22.510
The world doesn't care
what's in your brain.

29:22.510 --> 29:24.370
It's about what you look like.

29:24.370 --> 29:25.203
Don't believe me?

29:25.203 --> 29:26.550
Check your Instagram.

29:26.550 --> 29:27.950
Look at the beautiful women with a nice

29:27.950 --> 29:29.470
rack popping out of her shirt.

29:29.470 --> 29:32.540
Millions of followers
and millions of likes.

29:32.540 --> 29:34.890
Now go to the women that's
not ease on they eye,

29:34.890 --> 29:39.110
but she has an IQ of 128 and
her followers is about 20.

29:39.110 --> 29:42.630
With maybe 15 likes from her
mom and college professor.

29:42.630 --> 29:44.250
See my point?

29:44.250 --> 29:47.900
Beauty is everything and
it's the only choice in life.

29:51.776 --> 29:53.477
- Put the knife down!

29:53.477 --> 29:56.963
Don't become a race of plastic faces!

29:58.450 --> 30:01.563
Beauty comes from nature, not a knife!

30:02.460 --> 30:03.958
Put the knife down!

30:03.958 --> 30:05.764
Put the knife down!

30:05.764 --> 30:07.740
Put the knife down!

30:07.740 --> 30:10.110
- I do wanna put
everyone's concerns at ease

30:10.110 --> 30:11.810
about the added attention we have outside

30:11.810 --> 30:14.110
with the People Against
Plastic Surgery group.

30:15.010 --> 30:17.733
Bottom line, don't sweat it.

30:19.050 --> 30:21.000
It's not like we have Occupy
Wall Street out there.

30:21.000 --> 30:23.440
The fact is, they're
just a rag tag collection

30:23.440 --> 30:25.940
of ugly ass people that
can't afford our services.

30:27.260 --> 30:28.960
So let's focus on our own patients

30:30.100 --> 30:31.550
and make the world beautiful.

30:33.430 --> 30:34.450
- Would you ever marry a woman

30:34.450 --> 30:36.100
who's never been under the knife?

30:38.276 --> 30:39.680
- You know where the pens are?

30:39.680 --> 30:40.530
- Storage closet.

30:42.930 --> 30:43.870
- Sorry, what'd you say?

30:43.870 --> 30:45.233
- Would ever marry a woman

30:45.233 --> 30:47.839
that's never been under the knife?

30:47.839 --> 30:48.859
- I don't think
I can trust a woman

30:48.859 --> 30:50.159
who's never had surgeries.

30:51.300 --> 30:52.323
- Seriously?

30:55.670 --> 30:57.210
They're on the left.

30:57.210 --> 30:58.343
Top left.

31:01.010 --> 31:02.210
- You know what, I'm hungry.

31:02.210 --> 31:04.005
You going out for lunch?

31:04.005 --> 31:05.159
- What do you want?

31:05.159 --> 31:07.873
- I don't know, pick me
up some Mongolian chicken.

31:10.260 --> 31:11.823
Yeah, I don't have my wallet with me.

31:11.823 --> 31:13.700
- I am not paying for your lunch again.

31:13.700 --> 31:15.650
Okay you spend a grand on a pair of shoes,

31:15.650 --> 31:17.380
stop acting like a cheapskate.

31:17.380 --> 31:19.430
- Look, I really think I lost it alright.

31:21.150 --> 31:22.710
Let me go check the car.

31:22.710 --> 31:24.933
- What, did you go to the
strip club last night?

31:42.870 --> 31:44.340
- Looks like those people out there

31:44.340 --> 31:46.343
want to burn you at the stake.

31:47.460 --> 31:49.283
- It's all bark, no bite.

31:58.250 --> 32:00.600
Aren't you that nosy lady
from the gas station?

32:01.725 --> 32:04.550
- And aren't you the egotistical jerk who

32:04.550 --> 32:07.020
dropped his wallet, right?

32:07.020 --> 32:08.420
- So that's where I left it.

32:09.350 --> 32:10.200
What's your name?

32:11.730 --> 32:12.793
- Alana Upton.

32:14.390 --> 32:16.160
- Well Ms. Upton, how'd you find me?

32:16.160 --> 32:19.393
- Remember, you gave me this?

32:21.590 --> 32:23.770
- Well thanks for bringing back my wallet.

32:23.770 --> 32:26.530
- Looks like you have a nice place here.

32:26.530 --> 32:28.603
I read your reviews on Healthgrade.com.

32:29.580 --> 32:31.290
- It's pretty impressive right?

32:31.290 --> 32:32.340
- Hardly.

32:32.340 --> 32:34.120
People seem happy with their surgeries

32:34.120 --> 32:37.093
but not your bedside manners
and I can't say I blame them.

32:38.190 --> 32:41.333
- I find that very hard
to believe Ms. Upton.

32:42.170 --> 32:43.720
Look obviously I'm a great guy.

32:44.730 --> 32:45.903
Beguiling personality.

32:46.780 --> 32:48.713
- So how about that free consultation?

32:49.610 --> 32:50.443
- Follow me.

32:53.550 --> 32:55.400
- Bitches be hating but

32:55.400 --> 32:56.863
I make my money.

32:57.760 --> 32:59.710
- I don't mind paying her bills for now,

32:59.710 --> 33:00.860
I don't see why not.

33:00.860 --> 33:02.270
I got the money.

33:02.270 --> 33:04.410
I give it another week or two

33:04.410 --> 33:06.623
before I move on to the next chick.

33:07.810 --> 33:08.773
Wait, hold up.

33:09.827 --> 33:11.127
Is my wife gonna see this?

33:13.750 --> 33:17.060
- So, right now you're a,

33:17.060 --> 33:18.540
pretty much a B.

33:18.540 --> 33:22.080
We add 275 cc's you'll be

33:22.080 --> 33:23.313
pretty much a full D.

33:25.360 --> 33:27.410
Afterwards you'll be absolutely gorgeous.

33:29.090 --> 33:33.100
- So is this what you
tell all your patients?

33:33.100 --> 33:34.163
- I'm a realist.

33:35.060 --> 33:37.330
If you're not attractive or wealthy,

33:37.330 --> 33:39.470
there's really no way to
get anywhere in this world.

33:39.470 --> 33:40.610
If you're not one of those two things

33:40.610 --> 33:42.585
you might as well kill yourself.

33:42.585 --> 33:45.000
- That's such a shallow opinion.

33:45.000 --> 33:46.890
- What's wrong with being shallow?

33:46.890 --> 33:48.743
The world is a shallow place.

33:50.560 --> 33:54.670
- Excuse me, I need to
see Dr. Neiman right now.

33:54.670 --> 33:55.960
- Well Miss, there's only one way

33:55.960 --> 33:57.420
people get to see Dr. Neiman.

33:57.420 --> 33:58.940
I'm sorry, you'll have
to make an appointment.

33:58.940 --> 34:00.430
- I don't have time to
make an appointment.

34:00.430 --> 34:01.660
I need to see him now.

34:01.660 --> 34:03.420
- Dr. Neiman isn't here right now.

34:03.420 --> 34:05.240
So unless you plan on spending the night,

34:05.240 --> 34:06.510
you'll have to go.

34:06.510 --> 34:08.040
- Okay, I'll be back.

34:08.040 --> 34:09.340
But he better see me then.

34:14.929 --> 34:17.239
- Don't fall for the sick lies

34:17.239 --> 34:19.520
told by these butchers!

34:19.520 --> 34:22.110
You are beautiful as you are!

34:22.110 --> 34:23.793
Say yes to less!

34:24.725 --> 34:26.469
- Yes to less!

34:26.469 --> 34:28.290
- Hey, is this against Dr. Neiman?

34:28.290 --> 34:29.123
- Yes ma'am.

34:29.123 --> 34:31.304
- Oh you give
me one of those signs.

34:31.304 --> 34:33.020
- Say yes to less!

34:33.020 --> 34:35.060
- Yes to less!

34:35.060 --> 34:36.690
- Would you support using plastic surgery

34:36.690 --> 34:38.409
to repair the body?

34:38.409 --> 34:39.679
- Of course.

34:39.679 --> 34:41.572
- Well then you're contradicting yourself.

34:42.449 --> 34:44.980
Why is it okay to use
surgery to fix the body

34:44.980 --> 34:47.550
but it's not okay or acceptable

34:47.550 --> 34:49.172
to use surgery to enhance it?

34:49.172 --> 34:51.570
- When was the last time that you repaired

34:51.570 --> 34:53.310
a damaged body?

34:53.310 --> 34:57.010
Guessing you can't remember
because it's been that long.

34:57.010 --> 34:59.193
You're just a slave to the money.

35:00.940 --> 35:03.680
- Why did you even want this consultation

35:03.680 --> 35:05.630
if you don't even approve of what I do?

35:06.470 --> 35:08.880
- I just wanted to waste your time.

35:08.880 --> 35:11.708
- Clearly you've succeeded.

35:16.630 --> 35:17.463
Yeah.

35:20.168 --> 35:21.468
Alright I'll be right out.

35:26.610 --> 35:28.440
- I better get out of here.

35:28.440 --> 35:30.320
I wouldn't want to waste
anymore of your time.

35:30.320 --> 35:31.910
You might send me a bill.

35:31.910 --> 35:34.060
- Hey you know, that's
not a half bad idea.

35:37.800 --> 35:39.570
- Why is this door locked?

35:39.570 --> 35:40.553
- Go away Summer.

35:41.900 --> 35:43.061
Be out in a few.

35:43.061 --> 35:44.894
- We have a situation.

35:46.143 --> 35:47.620
- Duty calls.

35:47.620 --> 35:48.620
Let me know if you change your mind

35:48.620 --> 35:49.920
about that surgery alright?

35:49.920 --> 35:51.460
Give you a 10% discount.

35:51.460 --> 35:52.417
- Don't hold your breath.

35:52.417 --> 35:53.633
- You know Ms. Upton,

35:54.634 --> 35:55.534
I'm not a bad guy.

35:57.590 --> 35:59.840
I'm just trying to make
the world a better place.

35:59.840 --> 36:00.673
My own way.

36:01.514 --> 36:02.347
You know there's plenty of people

36:02.347 --> 36:03.340
that actually appreciate what I do

36:03.340 --> 36:05.090
because I make them feel beautiful.

36:06.300 --> 36:08.330
- There are plenty of ways

36:08.330 --> 36:10.870
to make the world a better place

36:10.870 --> 36:15.756
without turning people into plastic dolls.

36:15.756 --> 36:17.470
- Okay well one, this isn't just plastic,

36:17.470 --> 36:18.370
this is beautiful.

36:20.450 --> 36:23.480
And two, I get what you're saying

36:23.480 --> 36:25.080
but I'm running behind schedule.

36:26.660 --> 36:29.193
- I bet you have never been in love.

36:34.720 --> 36:36.330
- Okay.

36:36.330 --> 36:38.680
See, now why would you
say something like that?

36:40.134 --> 36:42.160
I actually plan on falling in love.

36:42.160 --> 36:43.543
Live happily ever after.

36:44.450 --> 36:45.450
It's on my schedule.

36:46.920 --> 36:49.053
- You are unbelievable.

36:50.441 --> 36:52.400
- We've already established
that, what's your point?

36:52.400 --> 36:56.293
- You are incapable of
giving or receiving love.

37:00.590 --> 37:02.490
- Okay Ms. Upton, it was a pleasure

37:02.490 --> 37:03.923
but please leave my office.

37:21.580 --> 37:22.910
- What's going on?

37:22.910 --> 37:24.774
Why was your door locked?

37:24.774 --> 37:25.660
I'm offended.

37:25.660 --> 37:28.376
- I had a breast implant consultation.

37:28.376 --> 37:30.054
- Interesting.

37:30.054 --> 37:31.020
- And why is that interesting?

37:31.020 --> 37:33.090
- You hate spending more than
10 minutes with a patient.

37:33.090 --> 37:34.680
They either want the
procedure or they don't.

37:34.680 --> 37:37.430
But you spent an hour
with this mystery woman

37:37.430 --> 37:39.273
who wasn't even on your schedule.

37:39.273 --> 37:42.620
- Well I felt a discussion
was necessary in this case.

37:42.620 --> 37:44.793
- Interesting, very interesting.

37:47.280 --> 37:49.750
- Ladies, don't be mad because your man

37:49.750 --> 37:51.319
can't keep his dick out of me.

37:52.700 --> 37:54.850
But fear not, I'm gonna give you the

37:54.850 --> 37:58.640
top 10 ways to be your
mans main side chick.

37:58.640 --> 38:02.435
Being sophisteratchicated
is what I like to call it.

38:06.330 --> 38:09.400
- Hey Dr. N, where do you
want me to place this?

38:09.400 --> 38:10.890
- Just drop it down there for me.

38:10.890 --> 38:11.723
Thanks Jeremiah.

38:12.780 --> 38:14.410
- So how are you doing?

38:14.410 --> 38:16.760
- Can't complain, how about you?

38:16.760 --> 38:17.890
- When are you going to let me kick

38:17.890 --> 38:20.270
it with you at one of your parties?

38:20.270 --> 38:22.260
- How about you get your
medical degree first

38:22.260 --> 38:24.760
and I'll let you slide without residency.

38:24.760 --> 38:26.300
- Damn yo, Stella Stunner tried

38:26.300 --> 38:28.740
shitting on everybody
in the game right now

38:28.740 --> 38:29.740
because of you.

38:29.740 --> 38:31.120
- Really?

38:31.120 --> 38:35.300
- Yeah, she's been dropping
this ratchet manifesto on her.

38:35.300 --> 38:38.560
She's lit with about
five million followers.

38:38.560 --> 38:41.130
She's definitely the
queen bee of reality TV.

38:41.130 --> 38:42.040
Hands down.

38:42.040 --> 38:43.653
- Wow, five million.

38:44.630 --> 38:46.720
Wonder how she got that many.

38:46.720 --> 38:48.770
- You gave her those magical titties doc.

38:50.140 --> 38:52.240
Everybody wants to watch her talk

38:52.240 --> 38:54.923
with them perfect puffs
popping out her front.

38:56.260 --> 38:57.630
- And that excites you?

38:57.630 --> 38:59.130
- Yeah, I may be a nerd,

38:59.130 --> 39:02.240
but big titties excite anybody.

39:02.240 --> 39:03.073
- Alright.

39:05.270 --> 39:06.270
Get out of here man.

39:09.270 --> 39:11.700
The oldest cliche in the book is true.

39:11.700 --> 39:13.023
Money can't buy you love.

39:14.170 --> 39:18.477
However, money does afford you
a lot of other distractions.

40:30.740 --> 40:33.250
- Hi, how can I help you?

40:33.250 --> 40:34.200
- Guess it depends.

40:38.350 --> 40:42.190
- Well if it isn't Dr.
Plastic surgeon of the stars.

40:42.190 --> 40:44.480
- I see you are already on the attack.

40:44.480 --> 40:45.943
- Oh I'm ready to pounce.

40:47.830 --> 40:50.520
- Guess I deserve that, it's expected.

40:50.520 --> 40:52.463
- So, what brings you here?

40:55.353 --> 40:58.153
- I guess I just wanted to
see if you changed your mind.

40:59.730 --> 41:02.800
- Look, like I told you before,

41:02.800 --> 41:05.580
I'm happy with my natural anatomy.

41:05.580 --> 41:08.680
So if that's why you came, well,

41:08.680 --> 41:09.683
I'm a little busy.

41:11.500 --> 41:14.023
Is that why you came Dr. Neiman?

41:19.100 --> 41:19.933
- No.

41:22.400 --> 41:25.913
Actually I came because
I wanted to ask you out.

41:27.130 --> 41:28.576
On a date.

41:28.576 --> 41:31.065
Like a debate maybe, I don't know.

41:31.065 --> 41:33.482
- What are you talking about?

41:34.753 --> 41:35.586
- I don't know, I guess I feel like

41:35.586 --> 41:37.663
I owe you a bit of an apology.

41:41.860 --> 41:43.200
Why is that funny?

41:43.200 --> 41:45.270
- So you're not trying to sell me

41:45.270 --> 41:46.750
on getting plastic surgery?

41:46.750 --> 41:48.770
You really wanna take me out?

41:48.770 --> 41:49.603
- Yes.

41:49.603 --> 41:50.623
I mean no.

41:51.710 --> 41:55.180
Look, I just wanna go
out and have a civilized

41:55.180 --> 41:57.750
conversation about our differences.

41:57.750 --> 41:59.773
- You know this can't be real.

42:00.900 --> 42:01.840
- Why not?

42:01.840 --> 42:03.173
- Think about it.

42:03.173 --> 42:05.223
That we're polar opposites.

42:08.350 --> 42:10.930
But I will try anything at least once.

42:10.930 --> 42:12.180
- Well how about tonight?

42:14.250 --> 42:15.860
- Deal.

42:15.860 --> 42:19.047
I know this restaurant
located off eighth street.

42:19.047 --> 42:21.547
Food so good it make you
wanna slap your own mama.

42:22.501 --> 42:24.810
- Well I actually don't
need any motivation

42:24.810 --> 42:26.170
to wanna slap mine.

42:26.170 --> 42:28.940
- It was just a joke.

42:28.940 --> 42:30.830
Look, you're already
working on your second

42:30.830 --> 42:33.380
awkward encounter, do I
need to take back my offer?

42:34.850 --> 42:36.170
- No.

42:36.170 --> 42:37.220
I'll see you tonight.

42:38.850 --> 42:40.660
I haven't been on a real date in years

42:40.660 --> 42:42.140
where I didn't have to order them over the

42:42.140 --> 42:44.070
phone like Chinese food.

42:44.070 --> 42:46.153
This should be interesting
if nothing else.

42:55.156 --> 42:57.029
♪ I never told you ♪

42:57.029 --> 43:01.345
♪ I would stand by your side ♪

43:01.345 --> 43:04.027
♪ No I never told you that honey ♪

43:04.027 --> 43:07.694
♪ You can't say that I lied ♪

43:08.620 --> 43:12.000
- Nervous, but I don't know why.

43:12.000 --> 43:14.770
I should be focused on
how this dates gonna go,

43:14.770 --> 43:16.400
but I can't help but notice women

43:16.400 --> 43:17.500
when I'm out socially.

43:18.680 --> 43:22.350
Think about all the ways I can
change them for the better.

43:22.350 --> 43:25.813
In a way, I guess I'm trying
to create the perfect woman.

43:29.753 --> 43:33.272
♪ And they took him alone ♪

43:33.272 --> 43:35.303
♪ He looked at her ♪

43:35.303 --> 43:36.900
- Wow, you look gorgeous.

43:36.900 --> 43:38.424
- Thank you.

43:38.424 --> 43:39.959
- You ready to go in?

43:39.959 --> 43:43.126
♪ He hung on a Sunday ♪

43:45.890 --> 43:47.803
- So, let's get to it shall we?

43:49.430 --> 43:50.263
- Sure.

43:51.890 --> 43:53.323
So, for the record.

43:54.510 --> 43:56.730
- Okay, for the record.

43:56.730 --> 43:58.530
- If it wasn't a financial issue,

43:58.530 --> 44:00.650
would you get cosmetic surgery done?

44:00.650 --> 44:01.920
- No.

44:01.920 --> 44:03.670
Why is it so hard for you to comprehend

44:03.670 --> 44:05.020
that I'm happy with myself?

44:06.191 --> 44:08.533
- Most women I know aren't
happy with themselves.

44:10.100 --> 44:12.623
- Low self-esteem perhaps?

44:13.470 --> 44:15.643
- In some cases maybe, but not all.

44:16.700 --> 44:19.740
- I believe that a woman
has to look within herself,

44:19.740 --> 44:21.700
not a mirror to find the courage

44:21.700 --> 44:23.610
and confidence to believe in herself.

44:23.610 --> 44:24.750
- You see, that's easy for you to say

44:24.750 --> 44:26.700
because you're easy on the eyes.

44:26.700 --> 44:29.960
Most women, would jump at the opportunity

44:29.960 --> 44:31.143
to improve themselves.

44:32.690 --> 44:35.474
Look, I'm trying to
understand what you're saying,

44:35.474 --> 44:36.474
I just don't get it.

44:37.575 --> 44:39.100
- You know, I can improve myself

44:39.100 --> 44:40.750
without having someone cut on me.

44:41.839 --> 44:42.889
- This is so surreal.

44:43.980 --> 44:46.000
- Well, maybe I'm just a figment

44:46.000 --> 44:47.173
of your imagination.

44:48.490 --> 44:50.300
- I think you're a freak of nature.

44:50.300 --> 44:52.050
- Why do you think that
most women would jump

44:52.050 --> 44:54.130
at a chance to be cut and reassembled?

44:54.130 --> 44:56.730
- I guess I can show you
better than I can tell you.

44:58.282 --> 45:00.093
Look over there, you
see those three women?

45:01.270 --> 45:03.720
Two out of those three
have gone under the knife.

45:04.989 --> 45:07.560
And I guarantee you the third
one is thinking about it.

45:07.560 --> 45:09.720
Just to close that
achievement gap between them.

45:09.720 --> 45:12.080
- What makes you so convinced?

45:12.080 --> 45:13.570
- I've done enough collagen injections

45:13.570 --> 45:14.820
to spot that a mile away.

45:16.599 --> 45:17.432
Look back there.

45:18.290 --> 45:19.123
Trophy wife.

45:20.310 --> 45:21.560
Do I even have to say it?

45:22.730 --> 45:24.791
- Now that's an easy one.

45:24.791 --> 45:27.020
- What about that one?

45:27.020 --> 45:28.973
Nose job, rhinoplasty.

45:29.840 --> 45:32.591
Way more people than you
realize have had that done.

45:32.591 --> 45:34.550
And everybody else wants to get it done.

45:34.550 --> 45:37.260
- But it doesn't mean
that most women want it.

45:37.260 --> 45:39.490
It only proves that
celebrity magazines try

45:39.490 --> 45:41.430
to bully regular women like me

45:41.430 --> 45:43.280
into thinking we need to get it done.

45:45.610 --> 45:48.240
Doesn't it bother you that the world

45:48.240 --> 45:49.993
is obsessed with the selfie?

45:51.350 --> 45:52.400
- Honestly I love it.

45:53.320 --> 45:55.400
More people realize their imperfections,

45:55.400 --> 45:56.913
the easier my job becomes.

45:57.870 --> 46:00.940
Besides, for example, women
that get breast implants,

46:00.940 --> 46:03.870
I see it as them making an
investment in themselves.

46:03.870 --> 46:06.170
That's how you guys pay your bills.

46:06.170 --> 46:08.970
- I'm quickly beginning to
realize that you're hopeless.

46:10.420 --> 46:12.960
- What is so wrong of people
taking a photo of themselves

46:12.960 --> 46:13.960
just to feel better?

46:15.300 --> 46:18.910
- It's crazy that someone
can take a pic or a video

46:18.910 --> 46:21.180
of themselves and millions
of people follow them.

46:21.180 --> 46:22.551
- I don't see what's wrong with that.

46:22.551 --> 46:24.366
It's just the world we live in.

46:24.366 --> 46:26.852
- What's wrong with it?

46:26.852 --> 46:29.110
It sends a bad message to our youth.

46:29.110 --> 46:31.890
I mean I'm tired of
scrolling down my timeline

46:31.890 --> 46:34.560
seeing ass and breasts.

46:34.560 --> 46:35.393
Really?

46:35.393 --> 46:38.018
Like leave something to the imagination.

46:38.018 --> 46:40.160
- I think you underestimate
the millennials.

46:40.160 --> 46:43.893
They're a bunch of selfish,
self-centered bastards.

46:45.530 --> 46:48.370
- Do you get a lot of
reoccurring customers?

46:48.370 --> 46:50.910
- Repeaters, what I call them.

46:50.910 --> 46:52.692
- See, that's my point.

46:52.692 --> 46:54.667
- You know, what is your point?

46:54.667 --> 46:56.200
I guess I'm missing it.

46:56.200 --> 46:58.770
- When does it stop?

46:58.770 --> 47:00.630
- I make people feel
good about themselves.

47:00.630 --> 47:01.880
Why does it have to stop?

47:02.940 --> 47:05.100
- If you make people feel
better about themselves,

47:05.100 --> 47:07.120
then why do they need to come back?

47:07.120 --> 47:08.663
Are you a bad plastic surgeon?

47:11.500 --> 47:12.870
I know you do a great job,

47:12.870 --> 47:16.020
but it's not enough to satisfy them.

47:16.020 --> 47:18.330
People have to feel good about themselves

47:18.330 --> 47:20.973
and no amount of surgery
is gonna fix that.

47:22.412 --> 47:24.440
- Can we get another round?

47:24.440 --> 47:26.014
Well I guess we should get to some of the

47:26.014 --> 47:27.047
more important stuff.

47:27.047 --> 47:28.623
Like your favorite movie.

47:29.782 --> 47:32.260
- Oh, you wanna go deep.

47:32.260 --> 47:34.517
Okay, that's a hard one.

47:36.280 --> 47:37.790
There's so many great movies.

47:37.790 --> 47:39.040
- Yeah, get to the point.

47:40.130 --> 47:44.950
- I guess I'll have to say
A Street Car Named Desire.

47:44.950 --> 47:46.420
- Really?

47:46.420 --> 47:48.077
Alright, didn't expect that one.

47:48.077 --> 47:50.100
It's a classic movie though.

47:50.100 --> 47:50.933
Stella.

47:50.933 --> 47:52.373
- Stella!

47:54.270 --> 47:56.470
Marlon Brando was so hot in that.

47:57.700 --> 47:58.777
What about you?

47:59.644 --> 48:00.644
- Godfather.

48:02.040 --> 48:03.810
- Not specific enough.

48:03.810 --> 48:05.800
One, two, or three?

48:05.800 --> 48:07.250
- Well I like all three,

48:07.250 --> 48:09.950
but if you're gonna make me
choose, I'm gonna say one.

48:11.500 --> 48:13.850
I guess I feel like
Michael Corleone sometimes.

48:15.250 --> 48:16.133
- In what way?

48:17.860 --> 48:20.360
- Struggle with the duality
between good and evil.

48:22.000 --> 48:24.030
I can empathize with his ambivalent views

48:24.030 --> 48:26.660
on what is best for his family versus

48:26.660 --> 48:27.763
what is morally right.

48:29.814 --> 48:30.647
And how far he's willing to go

48:30.647 --> 48:32.253
to preserve the Corleone legacy.

48:34.090 --> 48:34.990
- Pretty profound.

48:36.740 --> 48:38.083
- Yeah well Godfather's deep.

48:39.126 --> 48:39.959
- Deep?

48:46.740 --> 48:48.443
So this is my stop.

48:51.620 --> 48:54.420
- Well, Alana I had a really
good time with you tonight.

48:56.120 --> 48:57.617
- Weirdly, I did too.

48:59.200 --> 49:00.997
- Well can we do it again?

49:02.788 --> 49:04.870
- I'll think about it.

49:04.870 --> 49:05.703
- Fair enough.

49:08.960 --> 49:11.623
I don't buy into the love
at first sight bullshit.

49:12.770 --> 49:15.460
But there is something
special about Alana.

49:15.460 --> 49:17.330
When I see her I get this unexplainable

49:17.330 --> 49:18.573
feeling in my stomach.

49:19.600 --> 49:22.080
She isn't the centerfold type
that I would have multiple

49:22.080 --> 49:24.680
orgasms with and then kick
her out the next morning.

49:25.620 --> 49:27.010
Nah, for the first time in my life

49:27.010 --> 49:28.750
I had looked at women differently.

49:28.750 --> 49:30.723
She makes me wanna be a better person.

49:31.916 --> 49:33.528
- Beauty is not perfection!

49:33.528 --> 49:35.348
Beauty is not perfection!

49:35.348 --> 49:37.242
Beauty is not perfection!

49:37.242 --> 49:39.144
Beauty is not perfection!

49:39.144 --> 49:41.096
Beauty is not perfection!

49:41.096 --> 49:42.899
Beauty is not perfection!

49:42.899 --> 49:44.734
Beauty is not perfection!

49:44.734 --> 49:46.514
Beauty is not perfection!

49:46.514 --> 49:48.462
Beauty is not perfection!

49:48.462 --> 49:50.550
Beauty is not perfection!

49:50.550 --> 49:52.100
- Where the fuck have you been?

49:53.167 --> 49:56.340
- Just been taking care
of some business Stella.

49:56.340 --> 50:00.573
- Your business should be
taking care of me Dr. Neiman.

50:02.000 --> 50:03.770
- What can I do for you?

50:03.770 --> 50:08.770
- For start, bend me
over and spank me red.

50:08.800 --> 50:10.771
Then cream all over my back.

50:11.790 --> 50:13.530
- Come on, seriously.

50:13.530 --> 50:16.250
- I told you about that
role I was going out for.

50:16.250 --> 50:20.883
I feel like my ass and tits
are a little out of proportion.

50:22.044 --> 50:23.212
- Look, I think it's a really bad idea

50:23.212 --> 50:24.620
for you to keep going bigger.

50:24.620 --> 50:27.320
- I'm not asking for
your permission Neiman.

50:27.320 --> 50:29.120
I want that tramp Tasty Tee

50:29.120 --> 50:31.320
to throw shade at me.

50:31.320 --> 50:32.430
- Just think about it.

50:32.430 --> 50:34.713
- It's a done deal.

50:36.100 --> 50:36.990
- Don't you think they like you

50:36.990 --> 50:38.450
for your charming personality?

50:38.450 --> 50:39.283
- Oh fuck no.

50:39.283 --> 50:40.163
I hope not.

50:41.410 --> 50:42.530
- Alright.

50:42.530 --> 50:43.483
- Thank you doctor.

50:44.330 --> 50:47.860
Now, can you assist me

50:47.860 --> 50:51.897
with other services hmm?

51:06.170 --> 51:08.260
What's your malfunction Neiman?

51:08.260 --> 51:10.233
You're not turning homo on me are you?

51:13.290 --> 51:15.140
You don't find me attractive anymore?

51:17.510 --> 51:19.170
What?

51:19.170 --> 51:21.293
You got a side piece or something?

51:24.050 --> 51:27.033
Her pussy will never be good as mine.

51:28.040 --> 51:30.223
Look at me when I'm talking to you.

51:32.560 --> 51:34.110
- I have other patients to see.

51:36.490 --> 51:39.400
- So, you're going to let this

51:39.400 --> 51:42.499
five star pussy go to waste?

51:42.499 --> 51:45.770
- Why don't you go on and
set up your appointment.

51:45.770 --> 51:47.940
- I see what you're trying to do.

51:47.940 --> 51:49.390
You're trying to resist me.

51:49.390 --> 51:50.630
And I like it.

51:50.630 --> 51:52.897
It's getting me all moist and wet.

52:21.760 --> 52:24.253
- Wow, how'd you find this place?

52:25.850 --> 52:29.053
- My dad was an architect
before he passed away.

52:31.264 --> 52:35.100
Yeah, every Saturday we
would stop at Starbucks

52:35.100 --> 52:36.880
to get me a Frappuccino

52:36.880 --> 52:38.730
and then drive around the city looking at

52:38.730 --> 52:40.703
various architectural landmarks.

52:46.520 --> 52:48.393
This happens to be my favorite.

52:49.340 --> 52:51.220
Because it was the last artistic model

52:51.220 --> 52:53.170
he helped design before he passed away.

52:55.000 --> 52:57.390
So much passion and pain

52:57.390 --> 52:58.790
went into it's construction.

53:00.260 --> 53:02.443
- Sounds like you and your
father had a good relationship.

53:03.520 --> 53:05.860
- Yeah, my mom and dad both
believed in traditional

53:05.860 --> 53:08.290
values when it came to marriage.

53:08.290 --> 53:10.700
I mean they would fight a lot,

53:10.700 --> 53:13.200
but they managed to keep
it together for 30 years.

53:14.344 --> 53:16.013
- I wish I had a family like yours.

53:17.690 --> 53:19.253
- You know how family is.

53:20.110 --> 53:22.040
There are highs and lows,

53:22.040 --> 53:23.783
but we still gotta love 'em.

53:24.970 --> 53:26.530
What about yours?

53:26.530 --> 53:29.380
- Let's just say my family is
functionally dysfunctional.

53:30.920 --> 53:32.373
- Not unusual, whose isn't?

53:33.640 --> 53:35.273
- My dad had two families.

53:36.340 --> 53:38.913
He had the military and then he had us.

53:39.790 --> 53:41.320
He was a good dad though.

53:41.320 --> 53:42.370
I mean I love my dad.

53:42.370 --> 53:43.453
Great serviceman too.

53:44.820 --> 53:47.640
Kerry on the other hand
is a different story.

53:47.640 --> 53:49.540
- You call your mom by her first name?

53:50.500 --> 53:51.900
- Yeah, when I'm being kind.

53:53.230 --> 53:56.983
- Wow, sounds like you
and your mom had issues.

53:58.630 --> 54:01.360
- Kerry should've been in the military.

54:01.360 --> 54:02.260
She drilled me

54:03.450 --> 54:04.283
every day.

54:05.930 --> 54:08.663
Whether it was school,
or work, or just life.

54:10.360 --> 54:11.540
- Wasn't that a good thing?

54:11.540 --> 54:14.063
Looks like it turned you
into a successful doctor.

54:15.380 --> 54:17.480
- The Jackson family was successful right?

54:19.460 --> 54:22.563
Doesn't mean Joe Jackson
was a role model dad.

54:23.650 --> 54:26.073
In the end he probably just
screwed up all of his kids.

54:27.980 --> 54:29.993
- Well I can see how that effected you.

54:31.058 --> 54:32.700
Are they still together?

54:32.700 --> 54:33.800
- Yeah, unfortunately.

54:35.440 --> 54:37.553
I have no idea why my
dad's still married to her.

54:39.170 --> 54:40.755
- Well maybe they share a bond

54:40.755 --> 54:43.588
that you just wouldn't understand.

54:51.990 --> 54:54.530
- Yes ladies, you witnessing
the mighty Dr. Neiman

54:54.530 --> 54:55.670
running over.

54:55.670 --> 54:56.993
I am taking bets.

54:58.450 --> 54:59.900
- What's going on?

54:59.900 --> 55:01.620
- Dr. Neiman's running over.

55:01.620 --> 55:03.350
- But he never runs over on a case.

55:03.350 --> 55:06.290
- Right, that's why Dr.
Russell's running a side hustle.

55:06.290 --> 55:07.123
- What?

55:07.123 --> 55:09.710
Okay people go, get back to work alright.

55:09.710 --> 55:11.123
Play time is over.

55:12.430 --> 55:14.360
- Well well, I guess Mr. Perfect isn't

55:14.360 --> 55:16.140
so perfect after all is he?

55:16.140 --> 55:18.194
- You have the best job ever.

55:18.194 --> 55:20.330
- I know, I'm a lucky bastard.

55:20.330 --> 55:23.080
Get paid a shit ton of money
to administer happy drugs.

55:24.040 --> 55:25.340
What more could I ask for?

55:28.890 --> 55:30.323
- How are you feeling?

55:31.195 --> 55:32.730
- Better.

55:32.730 --> 55:34.070
- Good, well I'd like you to take

55:34.070 --> 55:35.650
the Percocet every four hours.

55:35.650 --> 55:37.690
It'll help keep the pain under control.

55:37.690 --> 55:39.410
The vaginal swelling should last about

55:39.410 --> 55:42.640
two to three days and then
dissipate gradually over time.

55:42.640 --> 55:44.360
- Can I take a shower?

55:44.360 --> 55:45.890
- Yes, you can take a shower.

55:45.890 --> 55:48.770
Just make sure that you use warm water.

55:48.770 --> 55:51.040
- Mrs. Martinez, how are you?

55:51.040 --> 55:52.540
- Still a little sore.

55:52.540 --> 55:54.450
- Yeah it's gonna take some time.

55:54.450 --> 55:56.320
But I do have something that's gonna

55:56.320 --> 55:58.391
make things a little bit easier.

55:58.391 --> 55:59.941
This is the amazing Mr. Pillow.

56:02.900 --> 56:04.410
It's gonna alleviate a lot of the pressure

56:04.410 --> 56:05.363
from your vagina.

56:06.300 --> 56:08.610
It makes recovery so much easier.

56:08.610 --> 56:09.760
- Thank you Dr. Neiman.

56:11.571 --> 56:15.000
- And as for you mister, a
couple of weeks, minimum.

56:15.000 --> 56:16.900
Before you can take a peek under the hood.

56:16.900 --> 56:17.733
Alright?

56:18.630 --> 56:20.070
- Thank you Dr. Neiman.

56:20.070 --> 56:21.839
- Alright, well listen I gotta run.

56:21.839 --> 56:23.530
You're in great hands,

56:23.530 --> 56:25.200
but call if you need anything.

56:25.200 --> 56:26.730
Okay?

56:26.730 --> 56:27.563
- Thank you.

56:31.660 --> 56:32.930
- What's going on with you?

56:32.930 --> 56:34.580
You're never late on a procedure.

56:35.780 --> 56:36.760
- It happens.

56:36.760 --> 56:38.110
- Bullshit it happens.

56:38.110 --> 56:40.763
It's never happened before
and it's not your style.

56:41.940 --> 56:43.640
- Maybe the streak is over Summer.

56:46.180 --> 56:48.200
Why are you looking at me like that?

56:48.200 --> 56:50.720
- In and out has always been your motto.

56:50.720 --> 56:52.120
What happened?

56:52.120 --> 56:53.023
- It ran over.

56:53.860 --> 56:54.860
- Normally you're halfway

56:54.860 --> 56:57.403
up to Mars by the time
a patient even wakes up.

56:57.403 --> 56:59.680
This is not the Dr. Neiman I know.

56:59.680 --> 57:00.773
Something's wrong.

57:09.200 --> 57:12.020
- Yeah, I actually just
finished up my last case.

57:12.020 --> 57:13.270
What do you have in mind?

57:16.410 --> 57:17.913
Okay, I'll see you then.

57:23.080 --> 57:24.430
- This explains everything.

57:26.290 --> 57:27.123
- Explains what?

57:27.123 --> 57:28.240
- Who is she?

57:28.240 --> 57:29.807
- Why?

57:29.807 --> 57:30.983
- Well is she a dancer?

57:31.925 --> 57:34.933
A model, actress, a porn star maybe?

57:36.212 --> 57:38.179
Does she meet your standards?

57:38.179 --> 57:40.179
Are her breasts the size of watermelons?

57:41.500 --> 57:42.600
Wait, hang on a second, how long have

57:42.600 --> 57:44.350
you been seeing this mystery woman?

57:46.301 --> 57:47.134
Hasn't been that long.

57:47.134 --> 57:49.865
I mean your longest relationship was,

57:49.865 --> 57:53.840
been what, four days, six hours?

57:53.840 --> 57:55.510
- Alright, enough.

57:55.510 --> 57:58.004
You ready to hear my UNLV story?

57:58.004 --> 57:59.960
- I don't know, are you ready
to give me some answers?

57:59.960 --> 58:01.070
- I am.

58:01.070 --> 58:03.060
- Okay then, let's hear it.

58:03.060 --> 58:06.600
- 1989, 1990, UNLV,

58:06.600 --> 58:08.720
they beat the living shit out of Duke.

58:08.720 --> 58:12.770
103 to 73, and the NCAA
tournament to win the title.

58:12.770 --> 58:15.460
- Okay wait, this is a basketball story.

58:15.460 --> 58:17.700
I don't follow and I don't see

58:17.700 --> 58:19.500
how it relates?

58:19.500 --> 58:21.810
- Well just listen to the story.

58:21.810 --> 58:23.990
UNLV, they were a powerhouse right?

58:23.990 --> 58:27.490
They were crushing teams all
the time by wide margins.

58:27.490 --> 58:28.870
They were probably the most exciting team

58:28.870 --> 58:30.483
to watch in the entire country.

58:31.320 --> 58:33.280
I mean all American like Larry Johnson,

58:33.280 --> 58:34.113
Greg Anthony--

58:34.113 --> 58:37.100
- Greg Anthony, yeah, he's the guy that

58:37.100 --> 58:38.820
got busted for the prostitution ring.

58:38.820 --> 58:40.210
- You wanna hear the story or not?

58:40.210 --> 58:42.310
- Okay, continue.

58:42.310 --> 58:43.340
Just for the record though,

58:43.340 --> 58:45.930
it's pretty boring so far.

58:45.930 --> 58:48.370
- The very next season,
UNLV had pretty much

58:48.370 --> 58:49.813
exactly the same team.

58:51.530 --> 58:53.440
Undefeated record the whole season.

58:53.440 --> 58:55.560
However, they end up
losing the championship

58:55.560 --> 58:57.420
to essentially the same Duke team

58:57.420 --> 58:59.220
that they crushed the previous year.

59:00.110 --> 59:01.870
Some people actually think that

59:01.870 --> 59:04.290
some of the players were paid off to lose.

59:04.290 --> 59:06.050
- And do you think they were paid off?

59:06.050 --> 59:07.190
- I don't know.

59:07.190 --> 59:09.550
All I know is that the previous season

59:09.550 --> 59:13.330
they had five losses,
won the championship.

59:13.330 --> 59:16.110
Next season they go completely undefeated

59:16.110 --> 59:17.970
in the regular season

59:17.970 --> 59:19.603
just to lose in the Final Four.

59:20.840 --> 59:23.230
Summer, the point I'm
trying to make is this.

59:23.230 --> 59:26.033
You can still win even with
a few losses along the way.

59:27.020 --> 59:28.653
- You lost me at the beginning.

59:29.800 --> 59:31.703
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

59:31.703 --> 59:32.883
I think I get it.

59:34.310 --> 59:37.270
Hey, if you're happy, I'm happy.

59:39.136 --> 59:40.386
- I think I am.

59:45.400 --> 59:46.950
- This is a no flex zone.

59:46.950 --> 59:48.530
Yes, that's right honey.

59:48.530 --> 59:50.720
Make your own chickies

59:50.720 --> 59:52.770
so you don't have to worry about them.

59:52.770 --> 59:54.760
And tomorrow you hoodrats out there

59:54.760 --> 59:56.493
that's trying to be me,

59:56.493 --> 59:58.236
you ain't me, okay?

01:00:09.403 --> 01:00:10.930
- I've never
really done the whole

01:00:10.930 --> 01:00:12.430
arts and crafts things before.

01:00:13.580 --> 01:00:15.153
- Relax, loosen up.

01:00:16.200 --> 01:00:18.250
You might actually have some fun tonight.

01:00:21.962 --> 01:00:23.312
What a unique piece of art.

01:00:25.910 --> 01:00:27.323
- What, that glass over there?

01:00:31.648 --> 01:00:35.590
- Look at the deformities of the glass.

01:00:35.590 --> 01:00:36.993
It's magnificent.

01:00:38.770 --> 01:00:42.020
Blemishes gives it it's
own unique identity.

01:00:42.020 --> 01:00:43.452
Like a birthmark.

01:00:43.452 --> 01:00:45.100
What do you think?

01:00:45.100 --> 01:00:47.810
- I think it looks like
a five-year-old made it.

01:00:47.810 --> 01:00:50.520
And I have this need to
fix it, so yeah, sorry.

01:00:50.520 --> 01:00:53.033
There's no American beauty moment here.

01:00:54.190 --> 01:00:55.023
- Come on.

01:00:55.870 --> 01:00:58.700
Let's get our hands dirty
and have some fun tonight.

01:00:58.700 --> 01:01:01.320
Hopefully I can break you
out of your little box.

01:01:01.320 --> 01:01:03.810
- There's a beauty at how
Alana looks at things.

01:01:03.810 --> 01:01:07.400
She's opened my eyes to
discovering a wider color palette.

01:01:07.400 --> 01:01:09.700
I just don't see greens and reds.

01:01:09.700 --> 01:01:12.140
I see yellows, purples, and cyans.

01:01:12.140 --> 01:01:14.360
Every artist undergoes
growth and transformation,

01:01:14.360 --> 01:01:16.600
so why can't I?

01:01:16.600 --> 01:01:18.913
Wow, I'm actually having
a really good time.

01:01:20.549 --> 01:01:23.243
- Don't worry, I won't tell anyone.

01:01:24.430 --> 01:01:27.003
Hey, what was your favorite
video game as a kid?

01:01:27.920 --> 01:01:30.570
- Man I didn't really get
to play many video games.

01:01:30.570 --> 01:01:32.250
I was always studying.

01:01:32.250 --> 01:01:34.100
- That's right, you live in Alcatraz.

01:01:35.950 --> 01:01:38.270
- Well, okay there was a few times where

01:01:38.270 --> 01:01:41.090
I snuck out to the arcades
to play some Pac-Man.

01:01:41.090 --> 01:01:42.050
- Pac-Man?

01:01:42.050 --> 01:01:43.100
Get out of here.

01:01:43.100 --> 01:01:45.520
That's my favorite video game.

01:01:45.520 --> 01:01:47.473
Well, I did like Ms. Pac-Man.

01:01:48.480 --> 01:01:51.080
- Yeah, I could play Pac-Man for hours.

01:01:51.080 --> 01:01:52.600
Huge fan.

01:01:52.600 --> 01:01:53.750
The only thing that pissed me off about it

01:01:53.750 --> 01:01:55.874
is the fact that it's unbeatable.

01:01:55.874 --> 01:01:57.120
- Yeah.

01:01:57.120 --> 01:01:58.633
Damn game never ended.

01:01:59.542 --> 01:02:00.901
- I have a question for you.

01:02:00.901 --> 01:02:01.901
- What's up.

01:02:02.920 --> 01:02:05.593
- Was Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man married?

01:02:06.910 --> 01:02:08.950
- Yeah, obviously.

01:02:08.950 --> 01:02:12.192
- Well then why is it Ms.
Pac-Man and not Mrs. Pac-Man?

01:02:12.192 --> 01:02:14.494
- Yeah, they were definitely married.

01:02:14.494 --> 01:02:17.873
- Well then explain why there's
no Mrs. Behind her name.

01:02:18.832 --> 01:02:20.680
- Don't know, don't care.

01:02:20.680 --> 01:02:24.200
All I know is you're ruining
my favorite childhood game.

01:02:24.200 --> 01:02:26.350
- You do know Santa
Claus isn't real right?

01:02:30.490 --> 01:02:32.040
I'm having the time of my life.

01:02:34.330 --> 01:02:35.480
I feel alive when I'm around you.

01:02:35.480 --> 01:02:36.930
Like nothing else matters.

01:02:38.490 --> 01:02:40.340
- So are we boyfriend and girlfriend?

01:02:47.220 --> 01:02:48.420
- I think it's time for me to show you

01:02:48.420 --> 01:02:49.827
something cool for a change.

01:03:05.750 --> 01:03:09.193
I literally eat, sleep,

01:03:10.400 --> 01:03:11.773
and breathe this place.

01:03:13.760 --> 01:03:14.593
It's all I know.

01:03:15.960 --> 01:03:17.210
It's all I've ever known.

01:03:19.518 --> 01:03:22.033
You know, I actually make a
pretty decent living doing it.

01:03:23.314 --> 01:03:26.383
In all that time, and all this success,

01:03:28.690 --> 01:03:31.250
I never once knew what real love was.

01:03:31.250 --> 01:03:32.083
Until now.

01:03:33.648 --> 01:03:35.377
You know, people they always tell me,

01:03:35.377 --> 01:03:39.077
"Dr. Neiman, Joseph,
you're so successful."

01:03:43.570 --> 01:03:45.170
For a long time I believed them.

01:03:46.840 --> 01:03:48.540
Went to my head a couple of times.

01:03:49.550 --> 01:03:51.830
Little did I know there
was this giant void

01:03:51.830 --> 01:03:53.483
that was growing inside of me.

01:03:55.920 --> 01:03:57.520
I didn't even know it was there.

01:03:59.940 --> 01:04:02.610
Until you showed up and started filling it

01:04:02.610 --> 01:04:04.733
with something I'd
didn't even know existed.

01:04:07.320 --> 01:04:08.463
Alana true love is not something

01:04:08.463 --> 01:04:10.343
that I ever thought possible for me.

01:04:14.206 --> 01:04:16.206
You're making me believe that it's real.

01:06:14.510 --> 01:06:16.340
Yeah, I never really believed somebody

01:06:16.340 --> 01:06:17.490
could change your life.

01:06:19.350 --> 01:06:21.363
But she really has.

01:06:22.800 --> 01:06:26.103
I feel like a new man.

01:06:50.970 --> 01:06:53.793
- Five years ago I was
diagnosed with breast cancer.

01:06:55.330 --> 01:06:58.160
My surgeon that I have a total mastectomy

01:06:58.160 --> 01:06:59.020
on my left breast.

01:06:59.020 --> 01:07:02.007
So we decided that would be
the best solution for me.

01:07:02.007 --> 01:07:04.403
And my husband has
supported me the whole way.

01:07:05.640 --> 01:07:08.280
- Doc, I wish I could've
taken her pain away

01:07:08.280 --> 01:07:09.173
and put it in me.

01:07:10.730 --> 01:07:11.630
Seeing her go through that,

01:07:11.630 --> 01:07:15.600
it was like being stabbed
with 1,000 knives.

01:07:15.600 --> 01:07:17.550
- You know, at first I thought I'd be okay

01:07:17.550 --> 01:07:19.530
being breastless for the rest of my life.

01:07:19.530 --> 01:07:22.070
But when I stare into the mirror at myself

01:07:22.070 --> 01:07:25.870
and I see that scar where
my left breast used to be,

01:07:25.870 --> 01:07:28.515
I feel so much less of a woman.

01:07:28.515 --> 01:07:29.348
- Honey.

01:07:30.348 --> 01:07:32.150
I love you just the way you are.

01:07:32.150 --> 01:07:33.233
I'll always love you.

01:07:34.190 --> 01:07:35.453
You'll always be beautiful to me.

01:07:36.914 --> 01:07:38.114
You're my sunrise Savoy.

01:07:42.390 --> 01:07:43.730
- Doc, I wanna know,

01:07:43.730 --> 01:07:46.863
what would be my options for
reconstructing my left breast.

01:07:47.800 --> 01:07:50.090
- There's so many
plastic surgeons in the area,

01:07:50.090 --> 01:07:52.040
why do you choose to protest outside

01:07:52.040 --> 01:07:54.070
Dr. Neiman's office?

01:07:54.070 --> 01:07:57.100
- Well there is certainly a
lot of blame to go around,

01:07:57.100 --> 01:07:59.150
but it starts with these butchers

01:07:59.150 --> 01:08:02.410
who mutilate women into society's ideals

01:08:02.410 --> 01:08:04.300
just to get a paycheck.

01:08:04.300 --> 01:08:05.570
We do not stand for that.

01:08:05.570 --> 01:08:07.580
This is not what we stand for!

01:08:07.580 --> 01:08:08.730
- That's right.

01:08:09.590 --> 01:08:12.630
- And Dr. Neiman is the
worst of their kind.

01:08:12.630 --> 01:08:14.190
- We all think that you need to take

01:08:14.190 --> 01:08:16.453
some time off until this mess blows over.

01:08:18.069 --> 01:08:19.550
We are just trying to look out for

01:08:19.550 --> 01:08:21.263
what's best for this practice.

01:08:23.350 --> 01:08:25.180
- I can't believe they
want you to take time

01:08:25.180 --> 01:08:27.200
off from your own practice.

01:08:27.200 --> 01:08:28.729
So what are you gonna do?

01:08:28.729 --> 01:08:31.529
- I am going to enjoy every
last second I have with you.

01:08:34.634 --> 01:08:36.734
You know, this older couple came in today.

01:08:38.210 --> 01:08:40.853
Their love between them, it was,

01:08:42.350 --> 01:08:44.372
inspiring to say the least.

01:08:46.250 --> 01:08:48.649
Kinda reminded me of the
love I want between us.

01:08:49.700 --> 01:08:50.740
- That's funny.

01:08:50.740 --> 01:08:51.710
- Why is it funny?

01:08:51.710 --> 01:08:53.109
- You.

01:08:53.109 --> 01:08:54.950
- What do you mean?

01:08:54.950 --> 01:08:57.370
- You never cease to amaze me.

01:08:57.370 --> 01:09:00.763
When I first met you, you
had no idea what love was.

01:09:01.740 --> 01:09:04.560
You had a warped perception of beauty,

01:09:04.560 --> 01:09:07.082
and now you're sounding
like a true romantic.

01:09:08.370 --> 01:09:09.483
It sounds good.

01:09:10.760 --> 01:09:11.763
But is it real?

01:09:15.100 --> 01:09:17.223
- People evolve and grow, you know?

01:09:19.590 --> 01:09:20.903
- Music to my ears.

01:09:30.662 --> 01:09:34.563
- Wow Summer, finally
learned how to knock.

01:09:35.560 --> 01:09:36.393
Come in.

01:09:38.920 --> 01:09:40.170
- Hello Jo Jo.

01:09:50.270 --> 01:09:51.569
- What are you doing here?

01:09:53.910 --> 01:09:55.520
- I've missed you.

01:09:55.520 --> 01:09:56.793
I needed to see you.

01:10:00.080 --> 01:10:01.030
- What do you want?

01:10:02.660 --> 01:10:05.560
- I'm here because I haven't
seen you in such a long time.

01:10:06.490 --> 01:10:07.890
- Well I've been busy Kerry.

01:10:09.220 --> 01:10:10.053
- Son,

01:10:12.090 --> 01:10:13.623
we've both gotten older.

01:10:15.870 --> 01:10:19.093
I realize what I put you
and your father through.

01:10:21.844 --> 01:10:23.570
- I don't think you do.

01:10:23.570 --> 01:10:26.210
- So I wasn't the best
mother in the world,

01:10:26.210 --> 01:10:28.003
and yes, I cheated on your father.

01:10:29.720 --> 01:10:31.900
And I put the weight of the world on you.

01:10:31.900 --> 01:10:33.210
- That's an understatement.

01:10:33.210 --> 01:10:35.170
- Joseph, I pushed you

01:10:36.700 --> 01:10:38.580
because I wanted you to be the best.

01:10:38.580 --> 01:10:39.880
And look, it's worked out right?

01:10:39.880 --> 01:10:40.713
I mean

01:10:42.170 --> 01:10:43.350
you're a great success.

01:10:43.350 --> 01:10:44.540
- It's not what I wanted.

01:10:44.540 --> 01:10:45.770
I wanted a mother.

01:10:45.770 --> 01:10:47.660
- What, like a real mom?

01:10:47.660 --> 01:10:51.740
One that bakes you cookies
and goes to PTA meetings?

01:10:51.740 --> 01:10:53.180
Poor kid!

01:10:53.180 --> 01:10:54.514
I won't apologize Joseph

01:10:54.514 --> 01:10:56.423
for wanting the best for you.

01:10:57.400 --> 01:10:59.150
- You know, ever since I was a kid,

01:10:59.990 --> 01:11:02.970
I pushed myself to be perfect.

01:11:02.970 --> 01:11:05.290
Pretty much on everything I ever did.

01:11:05.290 --> 01:11:09.450
Not for me, not to make
me happy, but for you.

01:11:09.450 --> 01:11:10.283
- I'm sorry.

01:11:11.764 --> 01:11:12.733
I'm sorry Joseph.

01:11:14.450 --> 01:11:15.653
I've made mistakes.

01:11:16.730 --> 01:11:18.173
Your father has forgiven me,

01:11:19.180 --> 01:11:20.423
why can't you?

01:11:21.410 --> 01:11:24.010
- 'Cause I see straight through you.

01:11:24.010 --> 01:11:26.163
- I was in such a dark place when I,

01:11:27.790 --> 01:11:29.860
when I cheated on your father.

01:11:29.860 --> 01:11:31.890
Joseph I'm not proud of it.

01:11:31.890 --> 01:11:32.790
- Fantastic.

01:11:32.790 --> 01:11:36.320
So I should feel better now
because you are not proud of it.

01:11:36.320 --> 01:11:39.120
- My infidelities were eating away at me

01:11:39.120 --> 01:11:40.943
from the inside out.

01:11:42.870 --> 01:11:45.510
I pushed you because I didn't want you

01:11:45.510 --> 01:11:50.393
to turn out as horrible a person as I was.

01:11:56.870 --> 01:11:58.123
- Don't justify it Kerry.

01:12:01.150 --> 01:12:01.983
- I'm not.

01:12:03.090 --> 01:12:04.363
Joseph it was wrong.

01:12:06.800 --> 01:12:07.823
I was wrong.

01:12:13.900 --> 01:12:15.150
- Goodbye Kerry.

01:12:26.160 --> 01:12:27.463
- I love you Jo Jo.

01:12:30.030 --> 01:12:33.173
- And truth is, I actually love my mother.

01:12:34.010 --> 01:12:35.980
I feel bad saying all those hurtful things

01:12:35.980 --> 01:12:38.113
I said to her and about her.

01:12:39.220 --> 01:12:40.810
No mother deserves that.

01:12:40.810 --> 01:12:41.760
I love you too mom.

01:13:06.350 --> 01:13:08.780
You look beautiful in your sleep.

01:13:08.780 --> 01:13:10.673
- Wow, creepy.

01:13:13.360 --> 01:13:14.213
I'm dead.

01:13:36.450 --> 01:13:37.930
Let's play hooky today.

01:13:37.930 --> 01:13:38.990
- Yeah?

01:13:38.990 --> 01:13:40.240
What do you have in mind?

01:13:57.430 --> 01:14:00.603
- Babe, you look like
you're a million miles away.

01:14:02.210 --> 01:14:03.330
I thought we agreed that you wouldn't

01:14:03.330 --> 01:14:04.383
let work get to you.

01:14:10.570 --> 01:14:11.720
- Kerry came to see me.

01:14:13.600 --> 01:14:14.433
- How'd it go?

01:14:17.020 --> 01:14:17.853
- Not too good.

01:14:20.160 --> 01:14:21.570
I had a lot to get off my chest

01:14:21.570 --> 01:14:24.270
and basically told her how
shitty of a person she was.

01:14:25.470 --> 01:14:27.220
- Don't you believe in forgiveness?

01:14:29.490 --> 01:14:31.153
- And how am I supposed to do that?

01:14:32.360 --> 01:14:34.160
She almost ruined my life.

01:14:34.160 --> 01:14:34.993
- People change.

01:14:38.480 --> 01:14:39.313
- Kerry won't.

01:14:41.810 --> 01:14:42.643
She can't.

01:14:44.242 --> 01:14:46.870
- Well maybe it's not
her that won't change

01:14:46.870 --> 01:14:48.223
but you who won't let her.

01:14:49.510 --> 01:14:51.010
- Why are you taking her side?

01:14:53.040 --> 01:14:54.640
She's the one that messed me up.

01:14:56.700 --> 01:14:59.373
- Life's too short to be holding grudges.

01:15:01.500 --> 01:15:04.153
- Well maybe you just haven't
had a mother like I've had.

01:15:05.830 --> 01:15:06.720
- I just think--

01:15:06.720 --> 01:15:08.970
- Look, I don't need
your advice on this one.

01:15:30.420 --> 01:15:33.382
- I'm Dr. Russell, I'm gonna
be your anesthesiologist.

01:15:33.382 --> 01:15:34.215
- Okay.

01:15:35.850 --> 01:15:37.830
- You're gonna feel a slight pinch

01:15:37.830 --> 01:15:39.093
with a short burn okay?

01:15:42.240 --> 01:15:43.133
Relax.

01:15:46.150 --> 01:15:47.900
Think about your favorite vacation.

01:15:50.590 --> 01:15:51.423
And sounds.

01:16:00.870 --> 01:16:02.183
- Hey doc, how'd it go?

01:16:04.490 --> 01:16:06.280
- You may be trying to ignore me...

01:16:10.588 --> 01:16:12.005
- But other parts

01:16:17.481 --> 01:16:19.120
are paying strict attention.

01:16:30.670 --> 01:16:31.930
- Summer, I'm gonna need you to set up

01:16:31.930 --> 01:16:33.790
that interview for me.

01:16:33.790 --> 01:16:35.243
- Oh now you see the light.

01:16:36.500 --> 01:16:39.210
You think that's a good idea right now?

01:16:40.065 --> 01:16:41.148
- Absolutely.

01:16:43.833 --> 01:16:45.920
I have a lot to get off my chest.

01:16:45.920 --> 01:16:47.733
- Are you gonna act a fool with them?

01:16:50.130 --> 01:16:50.963
Boss can I ask?

01:16:53.729 --> 01:16:54.993
- A lot on my mind Summer.

01:16:58.630 --> 01:17:00.250
- I just wanna say I hope you can get

01:17:00.250 --> 01:17:02.600
back to that happy place
I saw you in recently.

01:17:03.730 --> 01:17:04.563
You work well.

01:17:06.210 --> 01:17:08.640
Oh, and I need you to take a look

01:17:08.640 --> 01:17:10.690
at the sight screeners from the patients.

01:17:12.316 --> 01:17:14.160
You might find it interesting.

01:17:23.602 --> 01:17:24.570
- Can you give me your name?

01:17:24.570 --> 01:17:27.393
- My name is Stella Stunner.

01:17:28.940 --> 01:17:31.300
- Your real name please.

01:17:31.300 --> 01:17:33.970
- My name is Lana Townes.

01:17:33.970 --> 01:17:35.780
- And how old are you?

01:17:35.780 --> 01:17:37.203
- I'm 19-years-old.

01:17:38.660 --> 01:17:40.110
- And what
do you do for a living?

01:17:40.110 --> 01:17:41.983
- I work at a gentleman's club.

01:17:44.100 --> 01:17:46.830
- So, tell me a
little bit about yourself.

01:17:46.830 --> 01:17:48.263
- What do you want to know?

01:17:49.420 --> 01:17:50.620
- The basics.

01:17:54.350 --> 01:17:57.000
- I grew up in Baltimore Maryland.

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:58.253
And my mom raised me.

01:18:01.980 --> 01:18:04.360
My father only came around when he

01:18:04.360 --> 01:18:05.993
wanted sex from my mother.

01:18:09.050 --> 01:18:14.050
Never had a father daughter
kind of relationship with him.

01:18:16.690 --> 01:18:18.823
Not exactly an idealic life you know.

01:18:20.667 --> 01:18:22.910
- So, is
this your first surgery?

01:18:22.910 --> 01:18:24.583
- Yeah it is.

01:18:25.450 --> 01:18:27.093
- And why do
you wanna have surgery?

01:18:28.520 --> 01:18:30.708
- Why do I wanna have surgery?

01:18:42.130 --> 01:18:46.490
The surgery will give
me the attention I want

01:18:47.540 --> 01:18:48.373
from the world.

01:18:52.100 --> 01:18:56.723
Frankly, I just don't feel pretty enough.

01:18:59.046 --> 01:19:01.050
- Lana, you know the surgery

01:19:01.050 --> 01:19:04.167
isn't gonna change the way
you feel about yourself?

01:19:05.650 --> 01:19:08.430
- It doesn't matter how
I feel about myself.

01:19:08.430 --> 01:19:10.300
It's all about perception

01:19:10.300 --> 01:19:12.213
and how I want to feel about me.

01:19:38.580 --> 01:19:41.510
- I'm just thinking about what my

01:19:41.510 --> 01:19:42.810
mom told me the other day.

01:19:43.920 --> 01:19:45.883
- I thought you
didn't talk to your mom?

01:19:46.830 --> 01:19:47.663
- I don't.

01:19:49.320 --> 01:19:51.773
She just kinda showed up unannounced.

01:19:53.240 --> 01:19:54.073
Like you.

01:19:56.020 --> 01:19:58.140
What are you doing here Stella?

01:19:58.140 --> 01:20:01.123
- Obviously I'm here to swim.

01:20:02.610 --> 01:20:03.443
- Well there better not be

01:20:03.443 --> 01:20:04.920
any cameras following you.

01:20:04.920 --> 01:20:07.563
- No need to worry, I came alone.

01:20:08.475 --> 01:20:10.830
- I thought
you liked the attention?

01:20:10.830 --> 01:20:11.713
- I love it.

01:20:13.910 --> 01:20:15.653
But sometimes,

01:20:17.062 --> 01:20:19.460
I just need time

01:20:20.400 --> 01:20:23.523
to think and get away.

01:20:30.166 --> 01:20:33.480
I never knew you liked to swim.

01:20:33.480 --> 01:20:35.440
- I've always been fascinated by water.

01:20:35.440 --> 01:20:36.590
Ever since I was a kid.

01:20:38.980 --> 01:20:41.143
There's such a dichotomy
about it you know?

01:20:42.870 --> 01:20:44.803
It can be relaxing and soothing,

01:20:47.030 --> 01:20:49.240
but also very dangerous.

01:20:49.240 --> 01:20:50.073
Even deadly.

01:20:55.140 --> 01:20:56.440

01:20:58.660 --> 01:20:59.993
You created this you know.

01:21:04.990 --> 01:21:07.320
- Beauty is subjective Stella.

01:21:07.320 --> 01:21:09.173
But yes, I think you're beautiful.

01:21:11.950 --> 01:21:13.100
But I didn't create it.

01:21:16.010 --> 01:21:17.860
I just molded that was already there.

01:21:20.950 --> 01:21:22.483
- I'm not having the surgery.

01:21:23.380 --> 01:21:25.220
- Yeah, why change your mind?

01:21:25.220 --> 01:21:26.053
- I'm done.

01:21:26.970 --> 01:21:29.190
It's too hard to live up to the

01:21:29.190 --> 01:21:32.560
expectations of being this thing.

01:21:32.560 --> 01:21:35.840
This idea of a person that everyone

01:21:35.840 --> 01:21:37.833
expects you to be flawless.

01:21:40.366 --> 01:21:41.530
- Yeah I know how it can be,

01:21:41.530 --> 01:21:43.930
trying to live up to other
peoples expectations.

01:21:47.130 --> 01:21:49.810
- Thank you for everything Dr. Neiman.

01:21:49.810 --> 01:21:51.493

01:22:51.460 --> 01:22:52.293
Alana.

01:22:56.580 --> 01:22:58.520
- You didn't tell me how the surgery went

01:22:58.520 --> 01:22:59.693
with Mrs. Lynch.

01:23:00.800 --> 01:23:02.343
- It went okay.

01:23:03.210 --> 01:23:04.510
She came out like a champ.

01:23:06.550 --> 01:23:07.500
- That's wonderful.

01:23:09.560 --> 01:23:11.640
I remember when you said that their love

01:23:11.640 --> 01:23:13.663
was something that you wanted for us.

01:23:14.769 --> 01:23:16.569
- Well yeah, absolutely, I still do.

01:23:19.080 --> 01:23:19.913
- Really?

01:23:21.760 --> 01:23:23.960
'Cause I went down to
the pool the other day

01:23:25.799 --> 01:23:28.783
and I saw the most interesting thing.

01:23:30.270 --> 01:23:31.103
- I can explain.

01:23:31.950 --> 01:23:34.393
- What can you explain Dr. Neiman?

01:23:36.220 --> 01:23:37.816
- I can explain what you saw at the pool.

01:23:39.870 --> 01:23:42.213
- You can't explain shit!

01:23:44.188 --> 01:23:46.410
At least I now know what kind

01:23:46.410 --> 01:23:48.420
of relationship we had.

01:23:48.420 --> 01:23:50.930
- Can you at least give me a chance?

01:23:50.930 --> 01:23:52.633
- Do you even think I'm beautiful?

01:23:56.490 --> 01:23:59.843
You know what, none of this is real.

01:24:00.920 --> 01:24:01.993
- What are you talking about?

01:24:01.993 --> 01:24:03.433
I think you're gorgeous.

01:24:04.750 --> 01:24:07.623
- This love, the relationship we had,

01:24:08.499 --> 01:24:11.660
all of it has just been an illusion!

01:24:11.660 --> 01:24:14.060
'Cause you and I were never together.

01:24:14.060 --> 01:24:15.530
- Stop saying that.

01:24:15.530 --> 01:24:19.050
- You can't play both sides of the fence.

01:24:19.050 --> 01:24:21.460
You have to choose a side.

01:24:21.460 --> 01:24:23.780
- You made me believe in true love Alana.

01:24:23.780 --> 01:24:24.843
- Really Joseph?

01:24:26.510 --> 01:24:28.713
Or have you just been
pretending to love me?

01:24:33.350 --> 01:24:34.900
- Alana.

01:24:34.900 --> 01:24:35.733
Stop!

01:24:41.210 --> 01:24:42.393
I really do love you.

01:24:45.990 --> 01:24:47.760
It's strange how life
has it's own direction

01:24:47.760 --> 01:24:48.810
it wants you to take.

01:24:50.750 --> 01:24:53.743
Alana's right, we all
have to make a choice.

01:24:54.780 --> 01:24:57.190
Otherwise there's nothing at stake.

01:24:57.190 --> 01:24:59.743
And love is amazing,
but it's also dangerous.

01:25:01.140 --> 01:25:03.633
It's meant for the strong at heart.

01:25:03.633 --> 01:25:04.960
We have to decide whether you are strong

01:25:04.960 --> 01:25:06.400
enough to love somebody.

01:25:06.400 --> 01:25:09.465
'Cause if you're not,
your heart will give out.

01:25:41.987 --> 01:25:42.820
- Jo Jo.

01:25:44.525 --> 01:25:45.358
- Hi mom.

01:25:55.280 --> 01:25:56.113
- Steven.

01:25:56.990 --> 01:25:58.483
Steven Jo Jo's here!

01:26:01.751 --> 01:26:02.584
- Hi dad.

01:26:02.584 --> 01:26:03.417
- Jo Jo.

01:26:08.584 --> 01:26:13.584
Come inside.

01:26:17.974 --> 01:26:19.415
- Love it don't cut it!

01:26:19.415 --> 01:26:20.904
Love it don't cut it!

01:26:20.904 --> 01:26:22.699
Love it don't cut it!

01:26:22.699 --> 01:26:24.360
Love it don't cut it!

01:26:24.360 --> 01:26:25.330
- Can you give us your reaction to the

01:26:25.330 --> 01:26:27.950
protests against your
plastic surgery facility?

01:26:27.950 --> 01:26:29.504
- Love it don't cut it!

01:26:29.504 --> 01:26:31.607
Love it don't cut it!

01:26:31.607 --> 01:26:33.610
- You know what they say about opinions,

01:26:33.610 --> 01:26:35.050
they're like assholes.

01:26:35.050 --> 01:26:37.113
Everyone has one and they all stink.

01:26:38.710 --> 01:26:40.390
I'm a tax paying citizen
who makes a pretty

01:26:40.390 --> 01:26:42.640
healthy living off of
the insecurities of men

01:26:42.640 --> 01:26:44.683
and women just like yourself.

01:26:45.543 --> 01:26:47.026
- Love it don't cut it!

01:26:47.026 --> 01:26:48.700
Love it don't cut it!

01:26:48.700 --> 01:26:50.457
Love it don't cut it!

01:26:50.457 --> 01:26:52.573
Love it don't cut it!

01:26:52.573 --> 01:26:53.813
- Am I breaking the law?

01:26:55.470 --> 01:26:56.320
I don't think so.

01:27:00.175 --> 01:27:01.606
- Love it don't cut it!

01:27:01.606 --> 01:27:03.356
Love it don't cut it!

01:27:08.910 --> 01:27:10.320
- How could you Joseph?

01:27:11.189 --> 01:27:12.189
I loved you.

01:27:14.620 --> 01:27:17.453
We could of had something special.

01:27:20.614 --> 01:27:23.500
- People like you and
I don't fall in love.

01:27:23.500 --> 01:27:25.830
We wreck marriages,

01:27:25.830 --> 01:27:27.133
break up happy homes,

01:27:28.230 --> 01:27:32.483
cause fools to become homicidal, suicidal.

01:27:33.547 --> 01:27:35.650
We had a lot of fun together.

01:27:35.650 --> 01:27:36.877
Why resist me?

01:27:37.869 --> 01:27:40.472
I will always be your little secret.

01:27:43.030 --> 01:27:44.620
- None of this is real.

01:27:44.620 --> 01:27:47.173
Maybe I'm just a figment
of your imagination.

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:51.013
Wake up Joseph.

01:27:52.060 --> 01:27:53.167
- Wake up Neiman.

01:28:01.690 --> 01:28:04.050
- Joseph, I'm Dr. Lisa Rainbow.

01:28:04.050 --> 01:28:05.260
The coffee that hit your face

01:28:05.260 --> 01:28:07.170
was filled with hydrochloric acid

01:28:07.170 --> 01:28:09.000
and caused damage to your nerves

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:10.800
and your blood vessels in your skin.

01:28:12.380 --> 01:28:14.590
We had to perform an
autograft to prevent infection

01:28:14.590 --> 01:28:16.350
and fluid loss.

01:28:16.350 --> 01:28:18.530
- Dreams sometimes reveal
the deepest desires

01:28:18.530 --> 01:28:19.863
of the unconscious minds.

01:28:21.050 --> 01:28:23.013
My desire is love.

01:28:29.850 --> 01:28:33.090
Yes, beauty is in the eye of the beholder.

01:28:33.090 --> 01:28:34.790
And it took me a very
long time to understand

01:28:34.790 --> 01:28:35.940
what that really meant.

01:28:36.830 --> 01:28:38.970
You see, I used to think that everybody

01:28:38.970 --> 01:28:40.827
made their own opinions on what beauty is

01:28:40.827 --> 01:28:41.727
and what it's not.

01:28:43.400 --> 01:28:45.250
The truth is, beauty is in all of us.

01:28:46.930 --> 01:28:49.383
And it's up to the beholder to see it.

01:28:52.140 --> 01:28:53.700
All we have to ask ourselves is

01:28:53.700 --> 01:28:57.080
are we willing to accept the way he

01:28:57.080 --> 01:28:59.423
or she sees it?

01:29:02.070 --> 01:29:03.388
Thank you.

01:29:12.556 --> 01:29:13.389
Thank you.

01:29:16.070 --> 01:29:18.270
- Hi, I'm Lana Townes.

I'm a huge fan of your work.

01:29:20.910 --> 01:29:23.380
Question, how did you
come up with the idea

01:29:23.380 --> 01:29:24.933
for the illustration and title?

01:29:28.760 --> 01:29:30.510
- This image came to me in a dream.

01:29:31.690 --> 01:29:33.900
- Well do you mind signing it for me?

01:29:33.900 --> 01:29:34.750
