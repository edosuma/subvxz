00:10.920 --> 00:13.280
l'm sure l'll see you again.

00:13.400 --> 00:14.400
Hey.

00:14.520 --> 00:16.880
With any luck, l'll get sick.

00:19.800 --> 00:22.640
''With any luck, l'll get sick''?

00:22.720 --> 00:27.920
Lieutenant Rush is a nurse.
She works in the infirmary.

00:28.040 --> 00:29.920
So you were... flirting?

00:30.040 --> 00:34.000
- Well, l'm thinking of asking her out.
- Then you should.

00:34.080 --> 00:37.520
ln Kelowna, it's common for
that request to be passed on by a friend.

00:37.600 --> 00:41.360
- Oh, it is not.
- You could at least see if she's receptive.

00:41.440 --> 00:44.320
- Jonas, you are such a chickenshit.
- (alarm)

00:44.400 --> 00:46.960
(PA) Unscheduled offworld activation.

00:49.720 --> 00:52.720
- Who is it?
- The Russian team, ahead of schedule.

00:52.840 --> 00:55.680
- They're requesting a medical team.
- Open the iris.

00:55.800 --> 00:58.480
Page General Hammond
and Colonel O'Neill.

01:16.720 --> 01:22.000
l thought aliens weren't allowed back
to the SGC without prior permission.

01:24.720 --> 01:26.240
Carter, what's goin' on?

01:26.360 --> 01:30.320
Colonel Evanov and his team
brought this visitor back with them, sir.

01:30.960 --> 01:34.720
- Sergei, who the hell's that?
- l am Alebran.

01:36.080 --> 01:39.120
Alebran has vital information
on the Goa'uld Nirrti.

01:39.200 --> 01:40.480
What about her?

01:40.560 --> 01:44.800
She is experimenting on my people,
transforming us.

01:44.880 --> 01:48.320
l knew you would want to know
what Nirrti was doing to his people,

01:48.400 --> 01:52.160
since it was you who
allowed her to go free.

02:56.720 --> 02:58.720
Colonel, what's going on?

02:58.840 --> 03:02.960
Old Sergei brought this guy back
from 367 without authorisation.

03:03.040 --> 03:06.560
- You'd better have a damn good reason.
- General, sir...

03:06.680 --> 03:10.240
Alebran and his people
are innocent victims of Nirrti.

03:10.360 --> 03:12.160
l felt certain you'd wish to act.

03:12.280 --> 03:15.280
Colonel Evanov has promised
you will help us.

03:15.400 --> 03:17.760
Has he now?

03:18.280 --> 03:20.480
Are you in pain?

03:20.560 --> 03:24.160
lt's nothing that l cannot endure.

03:24.280 --> 03:26.720
Please, l must know
if you will help my people.

03:26.800 --> 03:30.080
Sir, l'd like to take him
into isolation room three.

03:30.160 --> 03:32.880
- Very well.
- Come with me.

03:44.480 --> 03:49.280
We found him near the Stargate after
we performed a recon of Nirrti's fortress,

03:49.400 --> 03:51.360
or l should say he found us.

03:51.480 --> 03:57.040
Alebran has asked for our help to save
his people being held prisoner inside.

03:57.160 --> 04:00.840
l thought that she was helping us.
We all did.

04:00.960 --> 04:06.400
And then l saw one of my people die
in such a horrible way, l realised...

04:07.520 --> 04:11.120
When l questioned her methods,
she released me.

04:11.240 --> 04:16.160
- She let you go?
- l was well enough to go home, she said.

04:16.240 --> 04:20.560
When l arrived back in the village,
everyone was dead.

04:20.680 --> 04:22.640
She'd lied to us.

04:22.720 --> 04:26.960
Those of us she took away
were the last of our people.

04:27.040 --> 04:30.240
- She was using us.
- You look OK to me.

04:30.320 --> 04:32.880
Please, do not be fooled
by my appearance.

04:33.000 --> 04:36.480
l have spent as much time
in the machine as the others.

04:36.600 --> 04:42.240
l know that l have been changed.
lnside, l am not like l was before.

04:42.360 --> 04:46.840
- What kind of machine?
- lt's one that sees inside of us.

04:46.960 --> 04:49.520
lt lets her manipulate
that which we are made of.

04:49.640 --> 04:54.640
lf he's talking about a machine that can
directly alter human DNA in real time...

04:54.760 --> 04:57.760
You believe Nirrti is
attempting to create a Hok'tar?

04:57.880 --> 05:00.960
- l'm not familiar with that term.
- lt means ''advanced human''.

05:01.040 --> 05:04.800
Nirrti wants to create the perfect
human host to increase her power.

05:04.920 --> 05:07.280
So... she's at it again.

05:07.400 --> 05:09.520
No, sir. This is worse.

05:09.600 --> 05:11.440
Sam's right.

05:11.520 --> 05:15.440
Up to now, Nirrti has been using eugenics,
like with Cassandra's people,

05:15.520 --> 05:19.280
breeding only those that demonstrated
specific genetic attributes.

05:19.400 --> 05:22.560
With a machine to alter DNA
and a population to experiment on,

05:22.640 --> 05:26.000
Nirrti could create a new host,
or alter the DNA of her current one.

05:26.080 --> 05:29.600
A Goa'uld with the powers of a Hok'tar.

05:29.680 --> 05:31.520
Obviously we can't let that happen.

05:31.640 --> 05:36.160
Nirrti does not have the power
and resources of the other Goa'uld.

05:36.280 --> 05:39.680
She has only a small number
of Jaffa in her service.

05:39.760 --> 05:45.280
l believe her capture, or if necessary
her assassination, is quite possible.

05:46.480 --> 05:48.240
- Sir?
- Agreed.

05:49.320 --> 05:52.240
- Can you get us in that fortress?
- No, l cannot go back.

05:52.360 --> 05:55.680
- We're offering to help your people.
- No, there's no time.

05:55.760 --> 05:57.280
l feel something happening.

05:57.400 --> 06:00.560
Alebran believes Nirrti
has the power to kill him, even here.

06:00.640 --> 06:03.280
What if she does?

06:04.120 --> 06:05.040
Cassandra...

06:05.160 --> 06:10.000
We need to know if Alebran has a device
like the one Nirrti placed in Cassandra.

06:10.120 --> 06:12.640
- You mean like a bomb?
- Go.

06:12.720 --> 06:14.000
Get him into x-ray.

06:14.120 --> 06:18.640
- No, it's too late.
- Breathe deeply. Go Let's move

06:22.200 --> 06:24.160
Take it easy.

06:25.600 --> 06:27.040
(Evanov) What is happening?

06:27.160 --> 06:30.640
Several years ago Nirrti hid
a naqahdah device inside a young girl

06:30.720 --> 06:32.800
in order to destroy the SGC.

06:32.920 --> 06:34.720
My team can take him back home.

06:34.800 --> 06:38.800
No, these devices detonate
in close proximity to the Stargate.

06:38.920 --> 06:40.800
- You have to kill me.
- Take it easy.

06:40.920 --> 06:43.520
- Kill me now
- Give him a sedative, 2cc Valium.

06:43.600 --> 06:46.880
- Something terrible is happening.
- We need a chest x-ray.

06:46.960 --> 06:48.880
- No
- Get him down.

06:49.000 --> 06:51.040
Please kill me

06:51.160 --> 06:53.920
(screams)

06:56.800 --> 06:58.640
Everybody get back

07:14.640 --> 07:16.720
(speaks Russian)

07:16.840 --> 07:18.960
What happened?

07:21.560 --> 07:25.760
This is Hammond. Hazmat team
to the level 22 elevators immediately.

07:25.840 --> 07:28.240
lt's like every cell in his body broke down.

07:28.360 --> 07:32.720
Nirrti must have written
some kind of time delay into his DNA.

07:35.480 --> 07:38.160
There's nothing we could have done, sir.

07:38.280 --> 07:41.120
- How soon can your team be ready?
- Right away.

07:41.200 --> 07:44.000
- l'd like to take SG-3 with me as backup.
- Very well.

07:44.120 --> 07:46.960
Allow my team to join SG-1 , General.

07:47.080 --> 07:50.840
- l don't think so, sir.
- Not so fast, Colonel.

07:52.880 --> 07:55.680
- Sir?
- Lieutenant Colonel Evanov's team

07:55.800 --> 07:58.720
has gathered intelligence
that could be useful to you.

07:58.840 --> 08:01.040
We have scouted the entire area, sir.

08:01.120 --> 08:04.560
l can get you right inside Nirrti's fortress.

08:04.680 --> 08:07.200
Fine. Get geared up.

08:08.640 --> 08:10.240
Thank you.

08:11.560 --> 08:12.400
General...

08:12.480 --> 08:16.240
Like it or not, a Russian team
is operating out of the SGC.

08:16.360 --> 08:19.120
l've been asked
to integrate them more fully.

08:19.240 --> 08:21.280
Does it have to be with my team?

08:21.400 --> 08:26.000
Lieutenant Colonel Evanov's a fine officer.
l'm sure you'll agree.

08:26.080 --> 08:28.080
You'll be in command.

08:29.400 --> 08:31.680
Yes, sir.

08:31.800 --> 08:33.679
l'll remind him of that.

08:44.840 --> 08:48.960
This is the path leading
to the fortress, guarded by Jaffa.

08:49.040 --> 08:51.200
- How many?
- Only ten.

08:53.880 --> 08:57.680
All right, Evanov. You're with us.

08:58.080 --> 09:00.880
(speaks Russian)

09:26.120 --> 09:30.160
- They're well positioned.
- We're gonna need a diversion.

09:30.280 --> 09:32.640
Carter, Jonas, that's you.

10:32.520 --> 10:34.720
Kree, Jaffa

10:45.800 --> 10:49.040
- Colonel
- l got him.

10:57.160 --> 11:00.480
Evanov, stay out here for now.
Watch our six.

11:00.600 --> 11:02.560
Yes, sir.

11:26.560 --> 11:28.320
Colonel.

11:32.960 --> 11:36.000
Please... don't hurt us.

11:38.840 --> 11:41.280
We're not here to hurt anyone.

11:42.560 --> 11:46.240
We've come here to rescue you,
take you from this place.

11:46.320 --> 11:50.800
- No, we can't leave.
- One step at a time here, Jonas.

11:52.760 --> 11:54.960
Where's Nirrti?

11:55.040 --> 11:58.240
- She is not here.
- Are you expecting her back?

11:58.360 --> 12:01.840
Of course... for our treatments.

12:07.040 --> 12:09.040
My name is Jonas.

12:11.880 --> 12:16.480
l am... Wodan.

12:22.240 --> 12:24.560
We've come from a place called Earth...

12:27.320 --> 12:29.760
to help you... all of you.

12:33.560 --> 12:35.600
That is not necessary.

12:37.440 --> 12:39.680
Nirrti is helping us.

12:50.600 --> 12:53.360
- Excuse me?
- She cares for us.

12:54.680 --> 12:58.640
- Nirrti is our god.
- Nirrti is of a race called the Goa'uld.

12:58.720 --> 13:02.640
They are parasitical beings
that use our kind as hosts.

13:04.320 --> 13:06.880
We are very ill.

13:07.000 --> 13:10.240
Nirrti is curing us of our sickness.

13:10.360 --> 13:12.400
That is most unlikely.

13:12.480 --> 13:20.040
When the god Nirrti came,
a great plague had befallen our people.

13:20.160 --> 13:22.600
We were dying.

13:22.720 --> 13:27.120
With the machine, Nirrti has kept us alive.

13:28.600 --> 13:30.800
Check it out.

13:35.760 --> 13:41.440
Don't take this wrong, friend, but...
if this is cured...

13:42.200 --> 13:45.680
My brother Alebran
once looked as l do now.

13:46.720 --> 13:50.720
ln time, she made him whole again.

13:52.040 --> 13:54.720
Alebran, you say?

13:55.360 --> 13:57.440
Your brother is dead.

13:57.560 --> 14:00.480
Nirrti allowed him to return to our village.

14:00.560 --> 14:03.680
There's no one left alive at your village.

14:04.760 --> 14:06.800
Alebran told us himself.

14:07.560 --> 14:09.040
Wha...?

14:10.320 --> 14:13.120
Might have been a different Alebran.

14:13.240 --> 14:15.440
lt's... a popular name.

14:17.400 --> 14:23.120
The point is, we need to know exactly
when and where Nirrti's coming back.

14:23.240 --> 14:25.520
Very soon.

14:25.600 --> 14:28.320
And when she comes, she will punish you.

14:30.200 --> 14:33.280
Your people were never sick.

14:35.360 --> 14:38.160
- Nirrti's been lying to you.
- No

14:38.280 --> 14:42.320
No, the plague ravaged our people
long before she came.

14:42.440 --> 14:45.040
Our village was almost wiped out.

14:45.120 --> 14:50.320
lt is possible she found them like this
and took advantage of their situation.

14:50.440 --> 14:55.120
She brought me to this place.
She gave me back my life.

14:55.200 --> 14:58.160
You said Nirrti would be
returning for your treatments.

14:58.240 --> 15:01.120
- What if you didn't get them?
- We would die.

15:01.200 --> 15:04.560
We must receive treatment by tomorrow.

15:05.680 --> 15:11.120
- Their mutations might be unstable.
- So... what happened to Alebran

15:11.240 --> 15:15.680
will most likely happen to them too,
if they don't go back in that machine.

15:15.760 --> 15:18.400
This is incredibly advanced technology.

15:18.520 --> 15:21.200
My guess is that
it was built by the Ancients.

15:21.320 --> 15:24.720
- Can you figure it out?
- Not by tomorrow.

15:24.800 --> 15:27.840
Maybe with a few days and a lot of help.

15:30.680 --> 15:34.360
- We're gonna need Nirrti, sir.
- Yeah.

15:34.480 --> 15:37.280
Figure out what you can.
l'll go brief Evanov.

15:37.400 --> 15:41.840
Jonas, Teal'c, take these folk someplace
where they can be comfortable.

15:41.920 --> 15:43.760
He intends to kill her.

15:48.960 --> 15:52.640
- What?
- You are planning to kill Nirrti.

15:55.560 --> 15:59.600
- Are you certain, Eggar?
- Yes, even now.

15:59.680 --> 16:03.840
No. First l intend to ask her,
in the nicest possible way,

16:03.920 --> 16:07.120
to undo what she's done to you folks.

16:07.200 --> 16:10.640
You'll just have to trust me.
We came here to help you.

16:10.720 --> 16:15.840
Only because you believe you are
responsible for what has happened to us.

16:17.320 --> 16:19.520
Do what you can.

16:23.880 --> 16:26.480
- Colonel.
- Nirrti's not home.

16:26.560 --> 16:28.720
She must have left
while we were on Earth.

16:28.800 --> 16:31.600
She's coming back.
l wanna set up an ambush.

16:31.680 --> 16:35.120
- l will inform my men.
- Your team will be our backup.

16:35.240 --> 16:39.920
We need her alive. She's the only one
that knows how to use that machine.

16:40.000 --> 16:41.920
Very well.

16:42.000 --> 16:46.920
By the way, did you talk to any of the
people in there, other than Alebran?

16:47.040 --> 16:49.200
No. Why?

16:50.000 --> 16:52.160
Probably nothing.

16:53.760 --> 16:56.200
l'll relieve you in two hours.

17:26.119 --> 17:29.360
- This is where you sleep?
- Yes.

17:34.280 --> 17:38.560
- How did you...?
- We cannot allow you to harm Nirrti.

17:41.640 --> 17:46.480
We have no quarrel with your people,
but l must insist you enter this cage.

17:56.120 --> 18:00.000
And l must insist the same of you.

18:09.000 --> 18:10.640
You're making a mistake.

18:10.760 --> 18:15.680
No. lt is you who has
made the mistake, Jonas.

18:18.480 --> 18:21.360
She is coming.

18:26.600 --> 18:30.560
Jonas, l'm already stymied here.
l could really use your help.

18:30.680 --> 18:32.480
Jonas?

18:33.640 --> 18:35.680
Colonel, Jonas isn't responding.

18:35.800 --> 18:37.080
Understood.

18:37.160 --> 18:39.120
Jonas? Teal'c?

18:42.920 --> 18:45.520
Evanov, this is SG-1 niner. Come in.

18:49.280 --> 18:51.280
Carter, stay put. l'm on my way.

18:51.680 --> 18:53.440
Yes, sir.

19:03.200 --> 19:05.200
(whoosh)

19:57.720 --> 20:02.240
(distorted) l'm sure you're aware that
a second shot from this weapon will kill.

20:02.320 --> 20:04.320
This weapon kills on the first shot.

20:04.400 --> 20:07.800
- Then why haven't you already fired?
- Cos l need you alive.

20:08.680 --> 20:10.440
- You?
- Yeah.

20:10.520 --> 20:13.320
l know it's kinda hard to believe.

20:14.680 --> 20:19.680
- But l need you to help these people.
- But l am helping them.

20:19.760 --> 20:25.200
- Yeah, l can see that.
- Appearances can be deceiving, Colonel.

20:43.160 --> 20:45.720
Now... as l said...

20:53.360 --> 20:55.120
Yeah.

21:22.240 --> 21:23.920
Carter?

21:24.040 --> 21:25.800
Sir.

21:27.800 --> 21:31.440
l really, really don't like that woman.

21:35.320 --> 21:37.080
- Yes, sir.
- (Teal'c) O'Neill.

21:41.840 --> 21:45.440
- This is an unpleasant surprise.
- lndeed.

22:04.560 --> 22:08.480
Wodan's telekinetic.
He took our weapons by thinking it.

22:08.560 --> 22:12.000
Nirrti is progressing
in her attempt to create a Hok'tar.

22:12.120 --> 22:14.880
- Maybe we're too late.
- No.

22:14.960 --> 22:19.040
These genetic manipulations are unstable.
She's not there yet.

22:19.120 --> 22:24.240
Eggar's telepathic. He did know that
Colonel O'Neill intended on killing Nirrti.

22:24.360 --> 22:27.120
That was not my intention.

22:28.120 --> 22:31.040
Who knows what abilities
these others possess?

22:31.120 --> 22:34.480
Enhanced senses, superhuman strength?

22:40.800 --> 22:42.880
Hey, folks?

22:43.920 --> 22:47.440
How you doin'?
Jack O'Neill, Earth. Listen.

22:47.560 --> 22:50.960
Originally we came here to rescue you.

22:52.520 --> 22:56.640
But, as you can see,
we've run into a bit of a snag.

22:56.760 --> 22:59.920
So if any of you can bend steel
with your bare hands,

23:00.000 --> 23:05.200
or happen to be more powerful than
a locomotive, just raise your hand.

23:08.160 --> 23:10.720
ldentify yourselves.

23:15.320 --> 23:17.280
Let us know where you are.

23:19.960 --> 23:22.240
Must not know what a locomotive is.

23:29.680 --> 23:32.160
Wood Man. Buddy.

23:38.320 --> 23:42.800
Listen. l think we're dealin' with
a bit of a misunderstanding here.

23:42.920 --> 23:46.080
Do you think Nirrti will
keep you alive with these powers

23:46.160 --> 23:50.880
after she's finished her experiments?
She's using you.

24:00.520 --> 24:03.280
- What'd she do to him?
- You are next.

24:04.600 --> 24:08.560
- l think l'm next.
- Nirrti has asked for this one.

24:08.640 --> 24:12.000
- And l'm asking you to take me...
- No

24:16.480 --> 24:18.560
All right, look.

24:18.680 --> 24:22.640
lf you really can see in my mind,
you know we came here to help you.

24:22.720 --> 24:28.320
l did sense that when you first arrived,
but when l looked deeper into your mind,

24:28.440 --> 24:33.360
l realised that you would sacrifice us all
if necessary to destroy Nirrti.

24:33.480 --> 24:36.880
- That's not true.
- You cannot lie to me.

24:40.480 --> 24:42.240
Come.

24:47.640 --> 24:51.160
At least l'll find out
how the machine works.

25:20.880 --> 25:25.920
Major Carter, l am pleased
to have such an excellent subject.

25:27.520 --> 25:29.680
l might consider you for my new host.

25:29.800 --> 25:33.400
- Over my dead body.
- True. That's far more likely.

25:35.440 --> 25:38.320
Now... step inside.

25:56.600 --> 25:59.040
Let's see what you're made of.

26:14.760 --> 26:17.040
Colonel, l'm sorry.

26:18.160 --> 26:23.920
l should never have
allowed myself to be captured.

26:26.520 --> 26:31.600
- Did you get a message off to your team?
- l tried, but my radio...

26:31.680 --> 26:35.040
- Yanked right out of your hand?
- Da.

26:35.760 --> 26:42.160
And at the same moment l was struck by
a zat'n'ktel that appeared from nowhere.

26:47.240 --> 26:53.840
My team would follow orders to return
to base if we were out of contact this long.

26:53.920 --> 27:00.080
- Perhaps they will send reinforcements.
- Hopefully it won't come to that.

27:01.480 --> 27:03.920
What'd they do to you up there?

27:04.040 --> 27:07.680
l don't know for how long
l was in the machine.

27:07.800 --> 27:09.840
Or what she did.

27:09.960 --> 27:13.040
But... something is different.

27:14.320 --> 27:16.320
We'll get out of this.

27:19.120 --> 27:21.200
Where is Major Carter?

27:34.600 --> 27:38.320
Enough. She has served her purpose.

27:42.040 --> 27:44.480
Bring me the one called Jonas.

28:05.480 --> 28:10.880
Fellas, you wanna do me a favour? Let her
know that l'm next. She should pick me.

28:11.000 --> 28:13.440
Her will is my command.

28:14.320 --> 28:18.160
Yeah, well...
there's your mistake, right there.

28:21.240 --> 28:23.040
Jonas.

28:47.840 --> 28:50.480
You didn't see that coming, did you?

28:56.840 --> 28:59.680
Do not attempt that again

29:07.840 --> 29:10.000
- Carter.
- Sir...

29:11.520 --> 29:14.640
You made it through.
You're gonna be all right.

29:14.760 --> 29:17.120
No, sir. l don't think l am.

29:33.600 --> 29:38.240
- We have not met.
- No, but l have heard a lot about you.

29:44.280 --> 29:46.160
You're not human.

29:46.280 --> 29:49.520
l'm human. l'm just not from Earth.

29:50.640 --> 29:55.640
A Goa'uld took my ancestors from Earth
thousands of years ago, enslaved them.

29:55.760 --> 29:57.920
Sadly, it was not l.

30:13.640 --> 30:18.800
The few thousand years on another world
have changed you more than you know.

30:28.120 --> 30:30.080
(coughing)

30:31.480 --> 30:33.440
Are you in pain?

30:34.800 --> 30:37.920
Something is happening. l can feel it.

30:40.200 --> 30:42.960
- ls there water?
- We'll ask.

30:45.680 --> 30:47.680
Try to rest.

30:58.160 --> 31:00.880
l have tried to communicate
with the other prisoners.

31:01.000 --> 31:05.840
They also believe Nirrti is a god.
They will not listen.

31:06.840 --> 31:08.880
He's in pretty bad shape.

31:08.960 --> 31:11.600
He is suffering
the same symptoms as Alebran.

31:11.680 --> 31:14.720
We gotta get to that guy...
what's his name?

31:14.840 --> 31:16.880
- Wodan.
- No, the other one.

31:17.000 --> 31:18.960
- Eggar.
- Yeah.

31:19.720 --> 31:23.040
lf he can read my mind,
why can't he read Nirrti's?

31:23.160 --> 31:26.880
He can't read minds all the time.
He'd have known Jonas was gonna jump.

31:27.000 --> 31:32.000
Perhaps he is afraid to look into the mind
of one he perceives as a god.

31:33.680 --> 31:37.280
- What?
- Nothing. l'm fine.

31:37.800 --> 31:40.000
Get some rest.

31:40.920 --> 31:43.200
lt's an order.

31:57.360 --> 31:59.120
(gasping)

32:08.280 --> 32:10.240
(gasps)

32:11.680 --> 32:14.000
(rushing of water)

32:33.840 --> 32:37.040
Why did you... bring me here?

32:37.120 --> 32:40.320
(Nirrti) Because you're different.

32:46.360 --> 32:50.240
- How's that?
- You are much closer than the others.

32:50.360 --> 32:52.000
Ah.

32:52.080 --> 32:54.640
With my help, you could
complete the transformation.

32:54.720 --> 32:57.680
End up looking like those others?

32:57.760 --> 33:00.640
No, l assure you.

33:03.280 --> 33:06.480
You must know that
you are capable of much more

33:06.600 --> 33:11.280
than the petty tasks that
life among the Tauri can offer.

33:13.360 --> 33:15.120
Uh...

33:15.200 --> 33:19.040
l... like my life the way it is.

33:19.160 --> 33:24.080
l can make you more powerful
than you could imagine.

33:24.200 --> 33:27.120
The powers you have seen
in Wodan and the others?

33:27.240 --> 33:30.480
Only a fraction of what l could give you.

33:32.360 --> 33:36.640
Well, that is... definitely

33:36.720 --> 33:43.040
the most interesting offer
l've had in a very long time.

33:44.320 --> 33:48.800
But you can't risk
giving me those kind of powers

33:48.880 --> 33:52.800
unless you're certain that
l won't use them against you.

33:52.920 --> 33:56.080
Once l share those powers,

33:56.160 --> 33:59.360
we could rule the galaxy... together.

34:04.280 --> 34:06.480
What about everyone else?

34:07.640 --> 34:10.080
- Unnecessary.
- Wow.

34:11.800 --> 34:17.040
l can only imagine what it would be like
to have powers like that.

34:19.520 --> 34:21.520
What would l do?

34:23.840 --> 34:26.800
l guess the first thing l would do...

34:28.360 --> 34:30.560
would be to free my friends

34:30.639 --> 34:35.199
and all those other people
you have caged up down there.

34:37.080 --> 34:39.440
And then l would destroy you.

34:41.440 --> 34:45.920
Not necessarily in that order,
but you get the idea?

34:53.600 --> 34:56.480
Take him away and bring O'Neill.

34:57.960 --> 35:04.000
Once you have seen what has happened
to the others, you will change your mind.

35:15.840 --> 35:18.000
- Evanov?
- Dead.

35:19.520 --> 35:21.520
Just like Alebran.

35:23.640 --> 35:27.680
Yeah, that's right.
Nirrti killed your brother.

35:30.760 --> 35:33.920
Go ahead. Take a look in my mind
if you don't believe me.

35:34.040 --> 35:37.640
Better yet... look into Nirrti's head.

35:37.720 --> 35:39.760
- That is forbidden.
- No kiddin'

35:39.840 --> 35:43.920
- Because she's hiding something.
- She is a god. She would know.

35:44.040 --> 35:47.520
She would not know,
because she is not a god.

35:49.640 --> 35:51.840
O'Neill is next.

35:53.120 --> 35:57.120
Look... she just killed a good man.

35:58.480 --> 36:00.720
She'll do the same to the rest of us.

36:00.840 --> 36:06.240
Together you're stronger than she is.
You just don't realise it.

36:32.520 --> 36:36.400
You know, you're right.
l did wanna kill her.

36:37.880 --> 36:39.880
But if you'd look into her mind,

36:40.000 --> 36:45.200
you'd wanna do the same thing
for what she's done to your people.

37:02.240 --> 37:03.920
You should not have come here.

37:04.040 --> 37:07.880
- Can you undo what you did to Carter?
- lf l choose to.

37:08.800 --> 37:12.360
l let you go once.
We made a deal, l honoured it.

37:12.480 --> 37:16.240
l told you then
l would not have done the same.

37:17.600 --> 37:23.200
Fix what you've done to Carter,
let the rest of my team go. That's all l ask.

37:23.280 --> 37:26.000
You can do whatever you want to me.

37:26.120 --> 37:28.880
Yes, Colonel. l can.

37:46.960 --> 37:49.040
Stop

37:49.640 --> 37:52.560
What he says is true.

37:52.680 --> 37:55.360
- My brother?
- She murdered him.

37:55.440 --> 38:01.040
She has murdered hundreds of our people
and she intends to do the same to us.

38:01.160 --> 38:03.280
Jaffa Kree

38:08.280 --> 38:10.320
l command you

38:23.640 --> 38:25.440
Wodan...

38:25.560 --> 38:28.240
- Stop.
- l am your god

38:28.360 --> 38:30.400
We need her alive.

38:34.000 --> 38:37.880
Wodan, she's the only one
who can help your people.

38:38.800 --> 38:43.200
l can make you more powerful
than your wildest dreams.

38:53.840 --> 38:56.800
Why did you do that?

38:56.880 --> 39:00.480
- She deserved to die.
- She was Carter's only chance.

39:00.600 --> 39:02.560
Not so, O'Neill.

39:03.680 --> 39:07.640
Before she died,
l looked into Nirrti's mind...

39:08.680 --> 39:10.880
and took what l needed.

39:12.320 --> 39:15.440
Hurry... while there is still time.

39:28.200 --> 39:30.360
Sir.

39:38.920 --> 39:41.840
lt is done. You are as you were before.

39:42.800 --> 39:44.560
Thank you.

39:46.560 --> 39:48.880
Yes... thank you.

39:49.000 --> 39:54.560
We can all be as we were before,
now that you have shown us the truth.

39:54.640 --> 39:57.880
Hail Dorothy. The Wicked Witch is dead.

40:02.160 --> 40:04.880
lt's a movie. Margaret Hamilton...

40:05.000 --> 40:10.000
The point is, with Nirrti gone, you can
get back to your lives, rebuild your village.

40:10.120 --> 40:13.640
We can help with food and supplies,
get you back on track.

40:13.760 --> 40:19.360
Once we get to know each other better,
l'd like a chance to study this machine.

40:22.440 --> 40:28.720
As soon as we have made our people
whole again, we intend to destroy it.

40:30.040 --> 40:34.160
- But it's incredibly advanced technology...
- Carter?

40:35.200 --> 40:38.240
Don't you think it would be for the best?

40:39.240 --> 40:41.800
Yes, sir. l guess it would.

40:45.400 --> 40:47.360
To Oz?

40:48.880 --> 40:52.360
- lt's... part of that movie.
- Thank you.
