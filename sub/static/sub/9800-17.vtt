WEBVTT

00:00.194 --> 00:04.553
Skorca!

00:10.614 --> 00:13.199
Penguin, penguin, make a wishy.

00:13.279 --> 00:15.978
Something scaly cold and squishy,

00:16.058 --> 00:18.706
hows about a tasty fishy

00:18.786 --> 00:20.444
what kind do you eat?

00:20.524 --> 00:21.680
Catfish!

00:21.760 --> 00:22.730
Albacore.

00:22.810 --> 00:23.683
Snapper.

00:23.763 --> 00:24.521
Fish!

00:24.848 --> 00:27.090
And don't forget the grenade.

00:32.116 --> 00:35.431
And that settles it. 
Private, you're on an aerial recon duty.

00:35.511 --> 00:37.848
What? Alone? All night?

00:37.928 --> 00:40.884
And with potential enemies on all sides.

00:40.964 --> 00:43.089
It's a soldier's paradise.

00:43.169 --> 00:44.474
Can I bring snacks?

00:46.868 --> 00:48.807
All right, deal.

00:50.288 --> 00:54.091
But nothing sugary. 
Recon man is focused, disciplined.

00:54.171 --> 00:56.103
The sweat stuff goes straight to the brain.

00:56.183 --> 00:58.265
Oh yes, of course.

00:58.441 --> 01:00.756
Must be careful of brain.

01:01.921 --> 01:03.889
Okay, I'm leaving now, 
don't wait up.

01:07.310 --> 01:08.933
Focus, discipline.

01:11.214 --> 01:12.985
Then, a little reward.

01:14.628 --> 01:16.119
Focus, discipline.

01:18.635 --> 01:20.532
Discipline, focus...

01:20.612 --> 01:23.655
Oh maybe just one more peanut butter winky.

01:25.869 --> 01:27.542
"Too much sugar".
What does Skipper know about sugar?

01:27.622 --> 01:30.234
I ate sugar and I'm the best recon 
I've ever... I see a fire engine!

01:30.314 --> 01:33.793
Weehoo! Weehoo! Wee-arrrrr! 
I'm a pirate - wow a caterpillar!

01:33.873 --> 01:36.924
My name backwards is etavirp - 
haha - what's a verp? Is it sugar? 

01:37.004 --> 01:38.241
I love sugar!

01:42.405 --> 01:45.290
What? No, no there can't be.

01:45.705 --> 01:48.141
It must be sugar playing tricks on my eyes.

01:48.221 --> 01:49.877
Out sugar, out!

01:50.600 --> 01:51.800
Oh, much better.

01:55.069 --> 01:57.875
Oh dear. I really should tell someone about this.

02:00.267 --> 02:01.547
No one is safe! 

02:02.041 --> 02:03.135
The end is near!

02:05.375 --> 02:07.395
What in the name of Gandhi's Nunchuks?

02:09.850 --> 02:11.624
Hit the snooze.

02:14.472 --> 02:15.814
No one is safe!

02:18.639 --> 02:21.250
Status report, Private.
What's up there, what did you see?

02:26.716 --> 02:27.590
It was... 

02:27.969 --> 02:29.099
an orca!

02:29.946 --> 02:33.621
Oh, the killer whale.
Deadliest predator in the sea.

02:33.701 --> 02:35.986
Yeah, this could be a real problem.

02:36.066 --> 02:37.537
In the middle of the zoo?

02:37.617 --> 02:39.346
Ba-da-bam. Meeting over.

02:39.426 --> 02:41.067
No, you don't understand. 

02:41.394 --> 02:43.609
This orca was giagantic. And it...

02:43.689 --> 02:45.135
It came from the sky.

02:46.632 --> 02:47.841
A sky orca?

02:48.732 --> 02:49.756
Skorca?

02:50.253 --> 02:52.441
That is what the cool people will call it now.

02:52.521 --> 02:54.030
Because we take two words 

02:54.110 --> 02:56.738
and we make them one, 
which is so hip, you know.

02:57.117 --> 02:58.803
Skorca!

03:00.560 --> 03:04.892
Who can be safe from the terror
that swims the skies? Nobody!

03:05.163 --> 03:08.287
All who agree please vote 
by getting panicky... now.

03:20.157 --> 03:21.816
I'll catch this skorca. 

03:22.892 --> 03:25.972
Catch'im, serve'im straight up on the barbie.

03:26.198 --> 03:27.477
For the right price.

03:31.349 --> 03:35.011
I don't think so. 
We'll eliminate this flying sea demon.

03:35.091 --> 03:38.569
And we'll even do it for free. Come on, boys.

03:40.266 --> 03:41.316
For free?

03:42.490 --> 03:46.021
What good is anything 
if it is not very expensive?

03:46.281 --> 03:50.128
Okay, peoples, your king has heard 
your babies squirrel for help

03:50.208 --> 03:52.974
And he, me, which is I, the king.

03:53.203 --> 03:55.683
I'm taking the controls of this crisis.

03:56.779 --> 03:58.703
Maurice! Give the hopperty thing
whatever he wants.

04:01.798 --> 04:03.747
All right, men, we've got 
an airborne predator.

04:03.827 --> 04:05.168
Kowalski! Battle plans.

04:05.248 --> 04:06.159
Rico, weapons!

04:08.903 --> 04:11.092
Private, I want full details on...

04:11.172 --> 04:12.597
What happened to your chin?

04:13.058 --> 04:14.516
No, it is nothing.

04:14.596 --> 04:16.051
Just calm down, let me see.

04:16.933 --> 04:19.766
Sticky. Sugar sticky.

04:19.846 --> 04:22.262
Oh, yes, see, about that...

04:25.169 --> 04:26.942
Peanut butter winky.

04:27.489 --> 04:29.395
Okay, I know what you're thinking.

04:29.601 --> 04:33.929
Private ate too much sugar and now he's dreamed up
some flying whale that doesn't even exist.

04:34.009 --> 04:36.382
Wow! That is what I am thinking.

04:36.462 --> 04:39.157
Sugar dreams and mind reading powers.

04:39.377 --> 04:44.343
- How many winkies did you eat?
- Skipper.

04:44.817 --> 04:48.791
This wasn't just some sugar dream. 
That orca, it was real.

04:48.871 --> 04:52.650
And we wanna believe you, Private.
But compare the evidence.

04:52.730 --> 04:54.744
On the sugary sugar side we've got

04:54.824 --> 04:57.294
empty snack cake wrappers and 
your own upset tummy.

05:01.680 --> 05:03.727
On the skorcy side... nothing.

05:04.063 --> 05:05.192
Less than nothing.

05:05.272 --> 05:07.482
Kowalski, what's the number less than nothing?

05:08.329 --> 05:09.661
Neg...finity.

05:09.741 --> 05:12.168
But maybe he moved, 
maybe he's even coming this way.

05:12.248 --> 05:14.171
Hey, we may already be a winner.

05:15.595 --> 05:18.357
Winky, winky, winky!

05:18.437 --> 05:20.474
That's a free box!

05:20.751 --> 05:22.198
Look, I see the skorca!

05:22.278 --> 05:22.895
Where?

05:23.230 --> 05:24.725
It... It was right over there.

05:24.805 --> 05:27.689
Argh, the contest already expired.

05:27.769 --> 05:29.557
Of all the bad luck.

05:30.233 --> 05:31.495
Skorca!

05:31.840 --> 05:33.305
You... You missed it.

05:34.125 --> 05:36.331
What's your diagnosis, Kowalski?

05:36.411 --> 05:38.929
Acute imaginosis of the frighty boom.

05:39.009 --> 05:40.587
Worst case I've ever seen.

05:40.929 --> 05:42.147
Is there any cure?

05:42.227 --> 05:44.979
Well, the sugar should wear off 
in less than 5 minutes.

05:45.350 --> 05:47.898
That's five too many.
Give me results, man.

05:47.978 --> 05:50.881
Okay. The skorca is a pretend creature.

05:50.961 --> 05:53.482
Therefore if we pretend to defeat it, 

05:53.562 --> 05:56.279
that should cure Private's 
sugar stroke fantasies.

05:56.359 --> 05:58.771
Imaginary combat. I like it.

05:59.054 --> 06:02.937
All right, men, initiate operation 
"Scaredy pants"... now!

06:03.294 --> 06:06.523
It's here. Skorca ahoy, Skipper.

06:07.062 --> 06:07.873
Engage!

06:13.334 --> 06:14.132
Skipper?

06:15.910 --> 06:17.622
You're all just pretending.

06:18.720 --> 06:21.103
Mama, it's got me, oh boy!

06:21.341 --> 06:22.223
Re-engage!

06:25.204 --> 06:26.439
They don't believe me. 

06:27.022 --> 06:29.263
I guess it's up to me to stop the skorca.

06:31.120 --> 06:34.384
If I don't come back, know that I've always loved you... 

06:35.373 --> 06:36.599
Lovely.

06:45.918 --> 06:48.821
Looks like Private's got it even worse 
that we thought.

06:48.901 --> 06:50.372
Pursue and restrain, boys.

06:55.057 --> 06:56.310
Target sighted.

07:06.890 --> 07:08.990
Stand down, soldier. We're only here to help.

07:09.070 --> 07:10.614
You could help by believing me.

07:10.694 --> 07:15.076
I wish I could, Private, but there's just 
no such thing as a giant flying orca.

07:15.156 --> 07:17.008
Why are the humans screaming?

07:21.610 --> 07:23.313
Kowalski, analysis.

07:23.393 --> 07:25.491
They appear to be too scared to move, 

07:25.571 --> 07:30.097
screaming through twisted frozen smiles 
that some unseen and terrifying...

07:31.363 --> 07:35.510
Odd. I don't remember a forecast of sudden 
giant orca-shaped shadow...

07:35.590 --> 07:36.957
Oh sweet mercy!

07:38.515 --> 07:41.612
Mother Mata Hari, it's real!

07:42.010 --> 07:42.834
Sorry.

07:42.914 --> 07:43.518
Sorry. 

07:43.598 --> 07:44.136
Sorry.

07:44.216 --> 07:47.267
It's okay, we have to get a higher ground, attack from above.

07:47.347 --> 07:49.517
You heard the man. 
Move, move, move.

07:50.409 --> 07:54.415
And... leading off the New York balloon parade 
for the sixth year

07:54.495 --> 07:57.255
is Ying Yang the wonderwhale.

07:57.335 --> 08:00.102
Well, Ying Yang had some technical oopsies, 

08:00.182 --> 08:04.752
but after a trial run last night
he is up and swimming for fun.

08:04.897 --> 08:08.675
I guess all's well that ends well, eh, Jilly?

08:09.827 --> 08:14.035
Move it, ya bludgers, or I'll rip your 
arm off to scratch my giant orca.

08:14.115 --> 08:16.161
Back off my skorca

08:16.241 --> 08:20.842
Come on, jumpy one. Defeat the skorca demon 
and his costumed minions.

08:20.922 --> 08:22.616
That guy is worth every penny.

08:22.775 --> 08:24.067
You see, Maurice.

08:24.147 --> 08:27.102
Where are the fight for free penguin-types now?

08:39.120 --> 08:43.364
Skipper, the creature appears to have 
some sort of a blubbery force field.

08:43.443 --> 08:44.188
Also...

08:45.679 --> 08:47.973
That's about to pure evil, gentlemen.

08:48.053 --> 08:49.481
Rico, grenade me.

08:54.325 --> 08:55.102
My car!

08:55.279 --> 08:58.579
Explosives are useless. 
 We'll have to go fin to fin.

09:01.288 --> 09:04.764
Oy, penguins. That fish is mine!

09:06.687 --> 09:09.463
The excitement is giving me 
the tingles. 

09:09.838 --> 09:13.376
Maurice, scratch me here 
till the tingles go away.

09:16.228 --> 09:19.346
It's not working, Skipper.
His shields are impenetrable.

09:19.426 --> 09:22.354
We'll have to keep fighting. 
There's no one else who can stop it.

09:28.385 --> 09:31.526
Maniac! Can't you see we share 
the same enemy?

09:31.606 --> 09:33.389
Joey don't share.

09:42.615 --> 09:44.688
Oh! I penetrated the shield.

10:07.565 --> 10:09.268
His name was Private.

10:09.642 --> 10:13.737
And he was the bravest little truth-teller 
we'll ever know.

10:14.749 --> 10:18.685
The boy saved us all and 
how did we repay him?

10:18.978 --> 10:22.243
By telling him, there was no skorca.

10:22.323 --> 10:24.380
Actually, Skipper, you're right.

10:26.251 --> 10:28.986
As of today, there's no skorca.

10:36.080 --> 10:38.259
Well done, Private, well done.

10:39.009 --> 10:40.597
A flying orca.

10:40.677 --> 10:43.298
It's like our worst nightmare brought to life.

10:43.378 --> 10:44.930
Interesting theory.

10:45.266 --> 10:47.617
But whose nightmare is the giant 
waffle cone sundae?

10:49.199 --> 10:50.858
Flee for your lives!

10:51.025 --> 10:53.999
How can we be saved from Two-scupula?

10:54.079 --> 10:57.105
The ice cream
that walks like a man?

10:58.764 --> 10:59.722
Oh, yes. That will do.
