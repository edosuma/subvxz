Hey, switch it up. See that

- Oh, now you sound like your old man.

00:25.483 --> 00:27.170
Don't start with that

00:46.046 --> 00:48.340
Why are you doing this, Carl?

00:48.423 --> 00:50.801
'Cause some fool smacked you

My arm, your legs.

Got nothin' to prove, all right?

01:05.858 --> 01:07.627
You're runnin' around

Yo, Farley, bring the

Call Thembi Wallace.
Don't ask why. Just do it.

04:23.847 --> 04:25.682
Tell her I'm out here.

04:28.518 --> 04:31.438

There's no way around it.
But I can still spin this.

04:36.651 --> 04:38.486
- [Luke grunting]
- [Stryker groans]

04:38.570 --> 04:41.949

I know you want to be out there.

05:29.287 --> 05:31.039
Luke told you to stay here.

05:31.123 --> 05:33.791
He has a reason, and I agree with him.

I know you both worry about me.

He's alone.

05:48.848 --> 05:51.809
Not that many people have
his back. He needs me.

I'm not paying for his sins anymore.

13:57.879 --> 13:59.547
[indistinct chatter on radio]

14:04.594 --> 14:08.055
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

14:08.139 --> 14:11.142
Oh, come on. You're not
even gonna try to move?

14:11.225 --> 14:13.478
Not even a lil' bit?

14:15.772 --> 14:17.314
Take his tired...

14:18.274 --> 14:19.859
broken...

14:19.942 --> 14:22.362
false-preachin' ass on out of here.

14:33.039 --> 14:34.749
[breathing heavily]

14:38.335 --> 14:40.797
I should be healed up in
a couple of hours, right?

14:42.048 --> 14:44.008
Sooner than that, Power Man.

14:48.555 --> 14:50.390
Nah, B.

14:51.307 --> 14:53.435
Brother deserves discretion.

15:04.946 --> 15:06.489
How did you know...

15:08.074 --> 15:09.784
that you could do that?

15:11.869 --> 15:13.079
The more I hit him...

15:13.996 --> 15:15.415
the more he dished out.

15:16.499 --> 15:18.084
So I stopped feeding him hate.

15:20.962 --> 15:22.547
What if it didn't work?

15:24.591 --> 15:27.176
Well, sometimes you gotta
throw out the science and...

15:28.177 --> 15:30.137
go for what you know.

15:30.221 --> 15:31.889
You heard me say that?

15:33.015 --> 15:34.767
I hear everything you say.

15:36.352 --> 15:37.937
Even when you don't speak...

15:39.271 --> 15:40.440
Still hear it.

15:40.523 --> 15:42.066
[man] Luke Cage!

15:42.859 --> 15:45.069
Thanks for keeping Harlem safe, baby.

15:49.782 --> 15:51.367
[sighs]

15:56.038 --> 15:59.166
I'm sorry, Luke. I'm
gonna need to bring you in.

15:59.876 --> 16:01.335
I need a statement.

16:02.545 --> 16:04.046
I'm done running.

16:04.130 --> 16:06.132
How many of these you own, brother?

16:11.428 --> 16:14.474
Looks like this place don't
wanna be a barber shop anymore.

16:16.267 --> 16:17.434
[sighs]

16:18.770 --> 16:20.021
Maybe not.

16:21.355 --> 16:23.608
But whatever it is,
it's gonna be famous.

16:24.526 --> 16:28.029
People are gonna be talking about
what went down here for years.

16:30.698 --> 16:32.033
You ready?

16:34.786 --> 16:36.829
You know how I feel about cop shops.

16:37.914 --> 16:39.206
Well...

16:39.290 --> 16:40.792
if it's any comfort,

16:40.875 --> 16:44.086
you'll have a front-row seat when
I nail Mariah's ass to the wall.

16:48.007 --> 16:49.425
How's Candace?

16:50.342 --> 16:52.970
Safe and secure at my mom's place.

16:54.013 --> 16:56.015
- Promise.
- Good.

16:56.098 --> 16:58.601
<i>All these people were
talking bad about Luke Cage.</i>

16:58.685 --> 17:01.437
<i>But they didn't stop for one minute
to look at the good he had done.</i>

17:01.521 --> 17:05.692
<i>Cleaning up Crispus Attucks by
himself, lookin' out for people...</i>

17:05.775 --> 17:08.109
<i>Most of these guys wear spandex.</i>

17:08.194 --> 17:11.321
<i>Who would have thought a black
man in a hoodie would be a hero?</i>

17:12.239 --> 17:14.742
<i>It's been an extraordinary
night here in Harlem.</i>

17:14.826 --> 17:17.619
See? I'm not the type of person

17:17.704 --> 17:21.207
who wants always to say, "I am right."

17:21.290 --> 17:22.959
- But...
- I'm glad you're right.

17:23.041 --> 17:24.417
[cell phone chimes]

17:26.753 --> 17:27.922
[sighs]

17:38.600 --> 17:40.101
[man] There he is. There's Luke.

17:40.184 --> 17:42.478
- [all clamoring]
- [camera shutters clicking]

17:42.562 --> 17:45.272
Hey, back it off. Back!

17:45.356 --> 17:47.650
[reporter 1] Mr. Cage, how
does it feel to be a hero?

17:47.734 --> 17:49.318
I'm no hero. I'm a regular guy,

17:49.401 --> 17:53.155
just trying to live life on his
own terms, one day at a time.

17:53.239 --> 17:54.406
Are you single?

17:54.490 --> 17:56.635
[reporter 2] Do you have anything
to say to Councilwoman Dillard?

17:56.659 --> 17:58.494
[all clamoring]

17:58.578 --> 18:00.347
[reporter 2] Have you
received any medical treatment?

18:00.371 --> 18:02.211
[reporter 3] How does
it feel to be vindicated?

18:05.376 --> 18:06.418
[scoffs]

18:06.502 --> 18:07.837
[chuckles]

18:08.963 --> 18:10.882
You can take a seat.

18:13.342 --> 18:14.385
Mr. Cage.

18:16.345 --> 18:18.139
My name is Inspector Priscilla Ridley.

18:18.222 --> 18:21.058
You realize there is a warrant
still out for your arrest.

18:21.976 --> 18:25.062
I do. I came here to clear things up.

18:25.980 --> 18:28.983
I haven't done any of the things
that I've been charged with.

18:29.066 --> 18:31.443
Even the dash cam video that
everyone's talking about?

18:31.527 --> 18:33.821
I'd like to provide some context.

18:35.281 --> 18:36.699
Would you like an attorney?

18:37.700 --> 18:39.076
I know a really good one.

18:39.160 --> 18:40.620
I'm not guilty of anything.

18:41.746 --> 18:43.247
I'll speak for myself.

18:56.468 --> 18:58.888
- Interrogation One?
- No.

18:59.806 --> 19:02.599
As far as I'm concerned,
he's no longer a suspect.

19:02.684 --> 19:04.936
And we both know if he
doesn't wanna be, he'll walk.

19:05.019 --> 19:07.104
Procedure says he should be in a room.

19:07.188 --> 19:09.691
He won't go for a room.

19:09.774 --> 19:12.484
Look, we can do it right
here, right now. It's fine.

19:12.568 --> 19:14.195
What about your sororal?

19:14.278 --> 19:17.573
You gonna let her just
skee-wee on out of here again?

19:17.657 --> 19:19.450
Actually, it's "ooh-woop..."

19:19.533 --> 19:22.453
and no, she's not going anywhere, but...

19:22.536 --> 19:26.874
we are showing her every
courtesy the NYPD extends...

19:26.958 --> 19:28.375
very slowly.

19:33.756 --> 19:35.925
[Mariah] I want my goddamn phone call!

19:36.843 --> 19:39.136
Okay, Mama. All right.

19:40.805 --> 19:42.598
Hmm. [sniffles]

19:45.601 --> 19:47.144
This ends here.

19:51.315 --> 19:52.566
You got it?

19:54.568 --> 19:56.821
I already said you
don't need to be here.

19:56.904 --> 19:58.489
I'm fine where I am.

19:59.406 --> 20:01.533
If Claire leaves, I leave.

20:01.617 --> 20:05.287
So be it. I'm not being
redundant. I'm just being thorough.

20:06.497 --> 20:07.623
Luke is innocent.

20:07.707 --> 20:11.418
Claire, I got this. I'm good.

20:11.502 --> 20:13.129
I know you do. It's just frustrating.

20:14.922 --> 20:16.632
Officer Albini in the park?

20:16.716 --> 20:19.218
[Luke] I wasn't even in the state.

20:19.301 --> 20:20.762
Claire and I went to Georgia.

20:20.845 --> 20:22.554
What were you doing in Georgia?

20:23.472 --> 20:24.807
Unfinished business.

20:24.891 --> 20:26.642
You said no more secrets.

20:33.607 --> 20:35.067
You don't have any scars.

20:35.151 --> 20:36.986
The doctor who did this to me...

20:37.904 --> 20:41.866
with Claire's help, did
it again, and I got better.

20:41.949 --> 20:45.661
The officer in the park? Damon Boone?

20:46.620 --> 20:50.207
Just match the fist prints from the
suit and gloves that Stryker was wearing.

20:50.291 --> 20:51.625
All of that was Stryker.

20:51.708 --> 20:53.669
Why didn't you just come to me?

20:53.753 --> 20:54.962
I didn't know you.

20:55.963 --> 20:57.256
I stayed out of it.

20:57.339 --> 20:59.425
Until you were right
in the center of it.

20:59.508 --> 21:00.885
They killed Pop.

21:02.136 --> 21:03.262
They did.

21:04.764 --> 21:08.017
I couldn't just lay in the cut anymore.

21:09.226 --> 21:10.812
Pop knew about my abilities.

21:11.813 --> 21:13.355
So I put them to good use.

21:13.439 --> 21:16.067
<i>I shut down Crispus Attucks personally.</i>

21:18.569 --> 21:20.029
That wasn't your job.

21:20.112 --> 21:26.577
People needed someone that didn't require
a warrant or shield to get things done.

21:26.660 --> 21:30.622
Call it a vigilante, or a superhero...

21:30.706 --> 21:32.041
Call it what you will, but...

21:32.959 --> 21:34.376
[sighs] like it or not,

21:34.460 --> 21:38.881
<i>I finally accepted that
that someone had to be me.</i>

21:38.965 --> 21:40.549
Maybe I could've helped you.

21:40.632 --> 21:42.969
This burden is bigger than you.

21:43.886 --> 21:45.262
Or me.

21:45.346 --> 21:47.014
People are scared...

21:47.974 --> 21:51.143
but they can't be
paralyzed by that fear.

21:51.227 --> 21:54.771
You have to fight for what's
right every single day,

21:54.856 --> 21:56.816
bulletproof skin or not.

21:56.899 --> 22:01.070
You can't just not snitch, or turn
away or take money under the table

22:01.153 --> 22:03.114
because life has turned you sour.

22:03.197 --> 22:04.991
When did people stop caring?

22:05.074 --> 22:10.704
Harlem is supposed to
represent our hopes and dreams.

22:10.787 --> 22:13.290
<i>It's the pinnacle of black art...</i>

22:13.374 --> 22:14.876
<i>politics...</i>

22:14.959 --> 22:16.460
<i>innovation.</i>

22:17.837 --> 22:20.631
It's supposed to be a
shining light to the world.

22:22.008 --> 22:25.677
It's our responsibility to push forward,

22:25.761 --> 22:29.515
so that the next generation
will be further along than us.

22:29.598 --> 22:33.727
Pop said his mantra aloud twice a day.

22:33.810 --> 22:35.938
The kids in the shop were pissed...

22:36.898 --> 22:38.941
but they could never unhear it.

22:39.025 --> 22:40.817
"Never backwards..."

22:40.902 --> 22:42.194
Always...

22:43.404 --> 22:44.530
forward.

22:44.613 --> 22:45.697
"Forward..."

22:45.781 --> 22:47.074
"Always."

22:50.077 --> 22:52.413
You forget I grew up around the man.

22:52.496 --> 22:54.206
I wish I could've met him.

22:54.916 --> 22:56.458
In a way, you have.

23:00.504 --> 23:02.339
Well, hello!

23:02.423 --> 23:04.133
Doesn't everybody have work to do?

23:06.593 --> 23:08.429
Is Mariah still in there?

23:09.555 --> 23:10.597
Yeah.

23:10.681 --> 23:13.809
Well, now that I'm
no longer a suspect...

23:14.726 --> 23:16.187
you guys got any take-out menus?

23:17.854 --> 23:18.940
I'm starving.

23:19.856 --> 23:22.901
You know, I kept telling
Cornell it was enough.

23:24.195 --> 23:28.615
He had enough money to keep
Harlem's Paradise flush.

23:30.117 --> 23:32.661
Even for opening
another club downtown...

23:33.829 --> 23:36.248
like our grandmother
always talked about.

23:36.332 --> 23:39.001
[takes deep breath]

23:40.586 --> 23:43.047
He had the talent to make it big.

23:45.924 --> 23:50.054
But there was always another
deal, another detail. [sniffles]

23:50.137 --> 23:53.182
And then this... this guy, Diamond Jim.

23:53.265 --> 23:54.641
Diamondback.

23:55.434 --> 23:57.561
Yes, Diamondback.

23:59.230 --> 24:02.399
Cornell said that he
was his direct contact,

24:02.483 --> 24:03.900
[stammering] whatever that means.

24:03.985 --> 24:07.613
And he was pissed off when
those guns were stolen.

24:07.696 --> 24:12.284
You know, in that... that thing that
your Detective Scarfe got caught up in?

24:13.035 --> 24:14.870
There were a lot of dirty hands.

24:15.454 --> 24:16.913
Not Cornell's.

24:16.998 --> 24:19.708
- He didn't have the guns.
- Oh, yes, he did.

24:20.626 --> 24:23.045
That's why Detective Scarfe got shot.

24:23.962 --> 24:26.965
Detective Scarfe stole
them from evidence

24:27.049 --> 24:29.343
and then gave them back to Cornell.

24:29.426 --> 24:32.054
[stammers] I don't know any details.

24:32.138 --> 24:36.683
I just know that Cornell
was scared and he wanted out.

24:36.767 --> 24:39.936
And the night when I came into the club,

24:40.021 --> 24:44.025
that big brother that was fighting
Luke Cage up on Malcolm X...

24:44.108 --> 24:48.320
"Hey," I screamed, and he... he
pulled a gun on me and said that...

24:48.404 --> 24:52.616
if I didn't say it was Luke
Cage, he was gonna kill me.

24:53.992 --> 24:55.119
He said Luke Cage?

24:55.202 --> 24:58.289
- That it had to be Luke Cage?
- Yes.

24:58.372 --> 25:01.792
He was firm about that. Luke Cage. Yes!

25:02.584 --> 25:06.297
- And Candace Miller?
- Oh, God. Candace. [inhales deeply]

25:07.214 --> 25:10.717
She tried to protect me,
but she didn't have to.

25:12.010 --> 25:13.512
[stammers]

25:13.595 --> 25:15.389
I feel terrible...

25:15.472 --> 25:17.891
that a decent man's
name has been maligned,

25:17.974 --> 25:22.604
but I will do whatever I need
to to rectify that. I will.

25:27.984 --> 25:30.362
You are absolutely
goddamn right you will.

25:30.446 --> 25:32.114
[door closes]

25:32.198 --> 25:34.283
Start by telling the truth.

25:37.661 --> 25:40.747
I am not a liar, Detective.

25:40.831 --> 25:41.998
[Misty] Mmm.

25:42.083 --> 25:44.000
According to the lab...

25:44.918 --> 25:47.338
Cottonmouth was struck
in the back of the head

25:47.421 --> 25:49.548
by a heavy, circular object...

25:50.382 --> 25:54.636
probably consistent with a
bottle, before he was pushed.

25:54.720 --> 25:57.306
[Ridley] How do we know
he was pushed, Detective?

25:57.389 --> 25:58.724
The angle.

25:59.641 --> 26:03.104
[Mariah screaming] No! No! No!

26:03.770 --> 26:06.440
I did not want it!

26:06.523 --> 26:07.608
[Stokes groans]

26:07.691 --> 26:08.692
No!

26:09.401 --> 26:11.903
[Misty] Cottonmouth landed on his back,

26:11.987 --> 26:15.657
- turned over, and then crawled.
- [Stokes groaning]

26:16.575 --> 26:18.285
[Mariah] You shut up!

26:19.286 --> 26:20.621
No!

26:20.704 --> 26:24.082
- No, I didn't want it!
- [breathing heavily]

26:24.166 --> 26:26.543
[Misty] Judging by the
wounds on his hands,

26:26.627 --> 26:29.421
he probably was pleading for his life

26:29.505 --> 26:33.884
when he was smashed by
a heavy, circular base.

26:33.967 --> 26:38.680
Now, the coroner thought it
was maybe a heavy waste basket.

26:38.764 --> 26:40.141
But my vote...

26:41.142 --> 26:42.851
it was a mic stand.

26:42.934 --> 26:46.855
I went through Harlem's Paradise
inventory records with the stage manager,

26:46.938 --> 26:48.690
and it turns out...

26:48.774 --> 26:52.528
there was a mic stand
that was unaccounted for.

26:53.320 --> 26:56.157
I've been around the music
business my whole life.

26:56.240 --> 26:58.992
Equipment goes missing.

26:59.075 --> 27:01.995
You can't trust niggas around equipment.

27:03.164 --> 27:05.832
- Cottonmouth was weakened.
- [Ridley clears throat]

27:05.916 --> 27:08.960
It wouldn't take a man
to kill him in that state,

27:09.044 --> 27:11.630
just somebody who was angry...

27:12.548 --> 27:15.091
and passionate about seeing him dead.

27:16.510 --> 27:18.094
And...

27:18.179 --> 27:20.556
someone who was sloppy...

27:21.265 --> 27:23.016
in the cover-up.

27:28.855 --> 27:30.357
[Candace] <i>Mariah killed him.</i>

27:30.441 --> 27:32.234
[Misty] <i>What?</i>
<i>How do you know this?</i>

27:32.318 --> 27:34.152
[Candace] <i>I heard them talking about it.</i>

27:34.236 --> 27:36.363
<i>The guy who always wears sunglasses...</i>

27:36.447 --> 27:38.990
<i>he was there, trying
to calm Mariah down.</i>

27:42.035 --> 27:43.495
And that's just a taste.

27:44.162 --> 27:46.373
I got plenty more where that came from.

27:49.376 --> 27:50.419
I...

27:51.670 --> 27:54.298
- I'm...
- [Misty] You don't have to say anything.

27:54.381 --> 27:56.091
Just tell the truth.

27:57.259 --> 27:59.177
We are right here.

28:00.512 --> 28:02.138
Make a deal.

28:02.223 --> 28:05.517
If you can help us nail
Shades and Diamondback,

28:05.601 --> 28:07.936
and maybe confirm some
of Cornell's contacts,

28:08.019 --> 28:09.605
we can make your stay...

28:10.814 --> 28:12.190
a little bit easier.

28:14.150 --> 28:15.569
That's all you got.

28:17.738 --> 28:21.032
Cornell liked fooling around
with them nasty-ass bitches.

28:21.116 --> 28:23.244
I... I had no use for chickenheads.

28:23.327 --> 28:24.953
You are going down.

28:25.036 --> 28:27.331
Go to trial with that flimsy-ass shit.

28:27.414 --> 28:30.959
I dare you. I double
damn dare you, trick!

28:31.042 --> 28:32.669
Oh! Trick?

28:33.670 --> 28:37.132
Whatever... Madam Inmate.

28:39.510 --> 28:42.137
- Misty.
- Not right now.

28:42.221 --> 28:43.305
Now.

28:56.026 --> 28:59.195
- Don't you ever, and I mean, ever...
- Misty.

28:59.280 --> 29:01.740
Interrupt an interrogation.

29:01.823 --> 29:02.908
What is it?

29:02.991 --> 29:04.826
Detective Chang just caught a body.

29:04.910 --> 29:08.247
An African-American woman,
mid-twenties, in front of a bodega.

29:09.540 --> 29:12.459
The victim had a pay-as-you-go
phone in her pocket.

29:12.543 --> 29:14.586
<i>I traced the phone's credit card.</i>

29:16.087 --> 29:17.589
It belongs to you.

29:18.507 --> 29:21.927
<i>Chang thought you might've gotten
cloned, but you bought the phone...</i>

29:22.636 --> 29:24.179
and you activated it.

29:25.681 --> 29:26.932
And the victim...

29:27.849 --> 29:31.061
had numerous text exchanges
with an NYPD cell phone number.

29:32.062 --> 29:33.146
It's yours.

29:33.229 --> 29:36.400
Come on. Where are you, Misty?

29:36.483 --> 29:37.859
I'm right here.

29:43.073 --> 29:45.284
How recent were the texts?

29:47.369 --> 29:49.120
I lost my phone...

29:52.207 --> 29:53.917
at the barber shop.

29:56.795 --> 29:58.922
Show me the picture, Bailey.

29:59.965 --> 30:03.635
- We should verify with the family first.
- Show me the goddamn picture, Bailey.

30:03.719 --> 30:05.095
Please.

30:09.057 --> 30:11.893
[Bailey] The victim appears
to be Candace Miller.

30:23.697 --> 30:25.449
Was that an important call, my dear?

30:25.532 --> 30:26.992
- You murdered her!
- Hey, hey, hey!

30:27.075 --> 30:28.595
- You murdered her!
- You are out of control.

30:28.619 --> 30:29.819
- Misty, stop!
- Get off of me!

30:29.870 --> 30:31.806
- You're hysterical. She's being...
- You murdered her!

30:31.830 --> 30:33.391
- She's being hysterical.
- You murdered Candace

30:33.415 --> 30:35.125
and you murdered Cornell.

30:35.208 --> 30:36.793
- Enough is enough!
- What?

30:36.877 --> 30:38.855
- What are you talking about?
- [Ridley] What is going on?

30:38.879 --> 30:40.797
Candace is dead.

30:40.881 --> 30:42.215
What?

30:42.298 --> 30:45.594
You stole my phone. I know it was you!

30:45.677 --> 30:48.514
You will say anything
about me, won't you?

30:48.597 --> 30:50.432
Where's your proof?

30:50.516 --> 30:52.393
I loved my cousin.

30:52.476 --> 30:53.810
[scoffs]

30:53.894 --> 30:56.312
And I would test that love

30:56.397 --> 31:00.401
against the recorded voice
of a dead whore any day.

31:01.192 --> 31:04.363
Am I still being charged with anything?

31:09.368 --> 31:11.202
- [clattering]
- No.

31:11.286 --> 31:13.288
Not at this time.

31:13.914 --> 31:15.499
[Mariah inhales deeply]

31:18.794 --> 31:21.212
You have the man who killed Cornell,

31:21.296 --> 31:24.383
Diamondback, in custody, Priscilla.

31:24.466 --> 31:26.051
Do the right thing.

31:26.968 --> 31:29.930
Keep him there. He is dangerous.

31:39.314 --> 31:42.192
That is the second time you
have attacked a civilian in here.

31:42.275 --> 31:44.528
This shield...

31:44.611 --> 31:46.572
ain't worth the tin it's printed on

31:46.655 --> 31:51.493
if Mariah Dillard can just walk
out of here after what she's done.

31:52.911 --> 31:55.288
- This system is broken, Priscilla.
- Mercedes...

31:55.371 --> 31:57.541
you are one of the finest
detectives I have ever seen,

31:57.624 --> 31:59.543
but you have got to learn...

31:59.626 --> 32:01.587
that there is no getting
around the system.

32:01.670 --> 32:03.088
You must work within it.

32:03.171 --> 32:05.632
Candace should have been
in protective custody.

32:05.716 --> 32:08.885
She should have been here and
I should have known about it.

32:09.803 --> 32:12.806
Mariah Dillard walked out
of here today because of you.

32:14.307 --> 32:16.101
Because you didn't trust our system.

32:19.480 --> 32:21.440
Because you didn't trust me.

32:32.200 --> 32:33.284
[sobs]

32:35.954 --> 32:37.163
[Claire sighs]

32:39.625 --> 32:41.627
Misty's been gone a long time. [sighs]

32:42.628 --> 32:43.962
That's never good.

32:45.506 --> 32:46.840
No.

32:50.051 --> 32:52.137
We have a lot to talk about, though.

32:53.388 --> 32:55.516
Like what?

32:55.599 --> 32:57.267
Your future.

32:59.060 --> 33:00.311
Your next moves.

33:01.229 --> 33:04.065
[sighs] Well, I don't wanna
talk about that right now.

33:04.149 --> 33:05.692
[inhales deeply]

33:05.776 --> 33:07.736
I just wanna chill.

33:08.695 --> 33:10.446
It's been a long day.

33:17.412 --> 33:19.831
You're right. It can wait.

33:20.624 --> 33:22.751
You wanna get coffee
when we get out of here?

33:24.460 --> 33:26.755
You accused me of not liking coffee.

33:27.548 --> 33:29.090
That's not true.

33:29.174 --> 33:31.301
Just depends on the blend.

33:33.011 --> 33:37.808
I hear that Cuban coffee
is particularly robust.

33:41.352 --> 33:42.813
[dishes clattering]

33:47.776 --> 33:51.029
That might be the corniest
thing you've said yet.

33:54.908 --> 33:57.202
It also happens to be true.

34:15.721 --> 34:17.347
Oh, thank you.

34:17.429 --> 34:19.641
Helping a sister out.

34:20.726 --> 34:21.810
[chuckles]

34:22.728 --> 34:25.021
The hero of Harlem.

34:25.105 --> 34:27.065
Congratulations!

34:27.148 --> 34:29.650
You are good for the neighborhood.

34:29.735 --> 34:31.402
[Luke] You're not.

34:31.485 --> 34:33.154
What about our deal?

34:34.072 --> 34:36.449
- Where's the file?
- What file?

34:37.533 --> 34:38.577
Buh-bye!

34:51.672 --> 34:53.341
What the hell happened?

34:53.424 --> 34:54.926
They killed Candace.

34:55.010 --> 34:57.763
What? My mom...

34:57.846 --> 35:01.182
Not your mom. She's
fine. We checked on her.

35:02.809 --> 35:06.146
Shades or somebody used my phone

35:06.229 --> 35:08.607
to lure Candace out of the apartment.

35:09.399 --> 35:10.734
But I can't prove it yet.

35:10.817 --> 35:12.152
What about her confession?

35:12.235 --> 35:14.070
- It's worthless.
- Why?

35:14.154 --> 35:17.490
If she were still alive,
that would be one thing.

35:17.573 --> 35:21.620
But she admitted to
taking money from Mariah,

35:21.703 --> 35:24.580
she changed her statement,
and now she's dead.

35:24.665 --> 35:26.625
The definition of reasonable doubt.

35:26.708 --> 35:30.170
And the woman she's accusing
is politically connected.

35:30.253 --> 35:34.049
It's unwinnable. There's no
way the DA will take that case.

35:34.132 --> 35:36.301
That's why Ridley just kicked her.

35:38.637 --> 35:41.514
Mariah and Shades will talk. Trust me.

35:42.808 --> 35:44.517
I told her not to leave.

35:47.103 --> 35:48.146
I know.

35:54.027 --> 35:55.195
[man] Carl Lucas,

35:55.278 --> 35:57.906
I'm Marshal Franco.
This is Marshal Johnson.

36:02.869 --> 36:06.039
You're under arrest for your
unlawful escape from Seagate Prison.

36:06.122 --> 36:07.248
What are you doing?

36:07.332 --> 36:08.667
You won't need those.

36:08.750 --> 36:10.919
- Says who?
- [Luke] Says me.

36:11.753 --> 36:12.838
I'm done running.

36:12.921 --> 36:14.089
I'm sorry, Mr. Cage.

36:14.172 --> 36:17.342
I'm gonna recommend the New York City
DA's office drop all charges against you.

36:17.425 --> 36:18.760
I have done all I can.

36:18.844 --> 36:20.804
Thank you for all you've done for us.

36:20.887 --> 36:22.513
Luke is innocent.

36:22.597 --> 36:25.809
They're not arresting Luke Cage.
They're arresting Carl Lucas.

36:27.018 --> 36:28.311
Who called you?

36:28.394 --> 36:32.691
Once a city councilwoman identified
Luke Cage as Carl Lucas on television,

36:32.774 --> 36:34.735
our office received numerous calls.

36:34.818 --> 36:36.527
The information's pertinent and valid.

36:36.611 --> 36:39.072
Mariah, again.

36:39.155 --> 36:42.242
I'm innocent, and I can prove it.

36:42.325 --> 36:44.995
It doesn't matter what you can prove.

36:45.078 --> 36:47.247
You still owe the state of Georgia time.

36:48.999 --> 36:51.417
[sighs] Okay.

36:55.839 --> 36:57.090
Sorry.

36:57.173 --> 36:59.217
Coffee's gonna have to wait, babe.

37:07.600 --> 37:08.810
[Claire] Luke.

37:37.672 --> 37:41.509
Like I said, I know a
really great lawyer in town.

37:41.592 --> 37:42.886
I'll call him.

37:42.969 --> 37:45.305
[sighs] Okay.

37:47.515 --> 37:49.893
- Be careful.
- Always.

37:50.811 --> 37:51.978
[chuckles softly]

37:52.896 --> 37:54.605
You're so corny.

38:15.460 --> 38:17.963
[Mariah] One of the things
that was happening was...

38:18.046 --> 38:19.714
[continues speaking indistinctly]

38:39.400 --> 38:40.610
[sighs]

38:46.157 --> 38:47.200
[sighs]

38:48.451 --> 38:50.120
Alex, you're the man.

38:50.203 --> 38:53.123
Anything you need, Madam
Councilwoman, let me know.

38:55.083 --> 38:58.003
It's old school. But
it's got a nice feel.

38:59.170 --> 39:00.380
Belonged to Cornell.

39:01.089 --> 39:02.382
It suits you.

39:04.968 --> 39:06.469
[chuckles softly]

39:08.763 --> 39:10.181
Yeah, it does.

39:13.268 --> 39:14.895
[engine starting]

39:16.271 --> 39:17.563
Let's head up.

39:20.400 --> 39:21.442
[sighs]

39:22.360 --> 39:24.404
It's a long trip. You
want something to drink?

39:25.321 --> 39:28.366
I was set up for something hot and
dark before y'all messed that up.

39:28.449 --> 39:29.784
[scoffs]

39:29.868 --> 39:31.661
Sweet Christmas.

39:31.744 --> 39:35.123
Well, we can stop for coffee at
Dunkin' Donuts before we hit the bridge.

39:36.291 --> 39:37.918
Ain't the same.

39:38.001 --> 39:39.544
Let's just get this over with.

39:42.380 --> 39:46.301
Oh. I like Chester
Himes. This is a good one.

39:46.384 --> 39:47.468
It's actually mine.

39:48.636 --> 39:49.888
What were you reading before?

39:49.971 --> 39:51.973
- [sighs]
- Some West Coast shit.

39:52.057 --> 39:53.099
Michael Connelly.

39:53.183 --> 39:55.643
- You ever read Harry Bosch?
- Nah.

39:55.726 --> 39:57.812
Well, you'll have some time to read now.

39:59.314 --> 40:01.149
No, I won't.

40:01.232 --> 40:03.318
I don't plan on hibernating.

40:03.401 --> 40:05.861
I was innocent before
and I'm innocent now.

40:06.862 --> 40:08.489
I've got work to do.

40:09.490 --> 40:11.993
[soul music playing]

40:15.580 --> 40:17.332
[indistinct chatter]

40:24.339 --> 40:27.175
[singing]

41:27.652 --> 41:29.320
[music continues playing]

43:39.450 --> 43:41.076
Sometimes backwards...

43:42.703 --> 43:44.372
to move forward.

43:46.332 --> 43:47.792
Always.
