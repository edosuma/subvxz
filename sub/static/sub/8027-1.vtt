05:18.902 --> 05:20.446
I'm sorry.

05:21.238 --> 05:22.865
<i>I'm sorry?</i>

06:15.585 --> 06:17.420
Sir, she's breaking out!

06:48.494 --> 06:49.954
What are we looking for?

07:00.172 --> 07:01.799
She jumped over the fence!

08:15.373 --> 08:18.919
A couple of trains came through here
about the time she escaped.

08:19.377 --> 08:22.339
Do you think she could have
gotten this far in that time?

08:22.631 --> 08:24.049
Is she that fast?

08:24.299 --> 08:26.134
She is that fast.

09:09.762 --> 09:11.180
And this too.

09:12.223 --> 09:15.351
- $3. 10.
- Three dollars and ten cents?

09:18.438 --> 09:21.023
- Your change.
- Thank you.

09:21.607 --> 09:22.900
Can I help you?

09:24.318 --> 09:26.320
The total is $ 17.95.

09:30.283 --> 09:31.826
Here's your card.

09:34.787 --> 09:36.664
Are you gonna buy those?

09:49.303 --> 09:51.013
Have a nice trip.

09:56.643 --> 10:01.231
It's brown tweed bag, like a duffel.
Do you see it anywhere?

10:01.440 --> 10:04.902
- Sir, it's not here.
- The porter said he put it on the cart.

10:05.152 --> 10:07.112
This is the cart.
There's no bag here.

10:28.342 --> 10:32.805
<i>Government authorities said it was
the largest earthquake to strike...</i>

10:33.097 --> 10:34.890
<i>He's riding Greased Lightning.</i>

10:35.182 --> 10:37.392
<i>That was Shorty Kincaid.</i>

10:40.562 --> 10:42.357
Enjoy the view.

11:13.763 --> 11:14.973
Excuse me.

11:30.238 --> 11:31.739
<i>We shouldn't be seen together.</i>

11:31.990 --> 11:35.493
<i>Father hasn't been dead long.
Do you think Arlen suspects?</i>

11:35.743 --> 11:38.872
<i>No. It's not too soon
for us to be together.</i>

11:41.500 --> 11:42.501
Tickets.

11:45.421 --> 11:47.381
Are you traveling by yourself?

11:47.923 --> 11:49.049
You're 12?

11:51.427 --> 11:53.721
Someone meeting you
in Los Angeles?

11:54.847 --> 11:57.558
We'll say you're 11.
Then you only pay half price.

12:19.288 --> 12:21.040
Our little girl did this?

12:21.290 --> 12:22.666
She's not a little girl.

12:23.125 --> 12:26.629
DNA typing and material found in
those wounds proves it was her.

12:26.879 --> 12:30.800
She could be anywhere. Chicago,
Las Vegas, Los Angeles, anywhere.

12:31.050 --> 12:32.301
We should stop the trains.

12:32.551 --> 12:36.347
And have the railroad and police
ask questions we can't answer?

12:37.306 --> 12:40.519
We'll put key personnel at
every stop along these lines.

12:40.977 --> 12:42.979
I want a team to track her.

12:43.230 --> 12:44.439
Hunt her down.

12:46.483 --> 12:48.276
- Good morning, Jill.
- Hello.

12:48.485 --> 12:53.031
- Thanks for taking care of my cat.
- We'll take good care of him.

12:53.323 --> 12:54.991
I won't be gone very long.

12:55.242 --> 12:56.785
Take care.

12:58.411 --> 12:59.412
Bye-bye.

12:59.621 --> 13:02.457
Are you still having problems
with the people at work?

13:02.666 --> 13:04.626
They point their finger
at me saying...

13:05.502 --> 13:09.047
<i>...I'm the weird one,
I'm the strange one.</i>

13:09.589 --> 13:11.466
Why? Because I have feelings?

13:11.758 --> 13:13.135
Because I feel?

13:16.596 --> 13:18.140
There's someone at the door.

13:19.266 --> 13:23.395
I won't answer that. Whoever it is
can come back at the end of the hour.

13:24.438 --> 13:25.647
That's for me.

13:27.524 --> 13:30.152
Sorry to interrupt.
We need your help, Dan.

13:31.027 --> 13:32.237
I know.

13:33.530 --> 13:35.031
Gotta go.

15:38.783 --> 15:41.703
Mr. Fitch will be with you all
in just a moment.

15:48.668 --> 15:49.878
Well...

15:51.129 --> 15:53.798
I guess we all must be here
for the same reason...

15:54.382 --> 15:55.383
...whatever that is.

15:55.800 --> 15:57.093
<i>I'm Dan Smithson...</i>

15:58.803 --> 16:01.264
<i>...and I don't know why
I'm here either.</i>

16:02.599 --> 16:05.894
But they said they needed me and
it was important, so I came.

16:06.770 --> 16:08.146
What do you do, Dan?

16:10.607 --> 16:11.816
I'm an empath.

16:14.194 --> 16:17.864
Sometimes they show me awful things
people have done.

16:19.866 --> 16:21.493
I try to tell them why they did it.

16:21.868 --> 16:23.828
What qualifies you for that?

16:24.788 --> 16:26.664
I feel things deeply, that's all.

16:29.876 --> 16:31.753
What am I feeling now?

16:35.883 --> 16:39.011
You wanna believe that
nothing affects you...

16:41.305 --> 16:43.182
<i>...that you're not afraid of anything.</i>

16:44.391 --> 16:45.935
<i>But you're curious...</i>

16:46.936 --> 16:48.938
...just like the rest of us.

16:51.148 --> 16:53.901
Stephen Arden.
Harvard Anthropology Department.

16:54.151 --> 16:55.861
Expert at cross-cultural behavior.

16:56.070 --> 16:58.948
Laura Baker. Hi. Molecular biologist.

17:00.574 --> 17:03.202
And who are you,
and what do you do?

17:03.994 --> 17:05.538
Preston Lennox.

17:06.413 --> 17:07.957
<i>And if I'm here...</i>

17:08.332 --> 17:10.459
...the shit has hit the fan.

17:11.085 --> 17:13.878
What exactly is your area
of specialty, Mr. Lennox?

17:14.672 --> 17:18.300
I'm a freelance solution to
our government's problems.

17:19.343 --> 17:21.137
What exactly might they be?

17:23.012 --> 17:25.891
The kind people don't usually
like to talk about.

17:28.060 --> 17:29.728
You hunt people, don't you?

17:35.652 --> 17:36.945
I guess so.

17:47.038 --> 17:49.416
You in here? It's a little late for Tv.

17:53.879 --> 17:55.422
You in here, honey?

18:47.683 --> 18:50.228
Good evening, I'm Xavier Fitch.

18:50.520 --> 18:52.313
I'm in charge of this operation.

18:52.522 --> 18:54.649
Would you sit a little closer, please?

19:04.534 --> 19:07.078
In November of 1974...

19:07.703 --> 19:10.039
...a small group from S.E.T. I...

19:10.289 --> 19:13.334
...S- E-T-I, Search for
Extraterrestrial Intelligence...

19:13.543 --> 19:15.878
...used radio dishes at Arecibo...

19:16.129 --> 19:18.131
...to send a message to whoever
was listening.

19:18.381 --> 19:21.050
They sent a quarter of a kilobyte...

19:21.300 --> 19:23.886
...including structure
of human DNA...

19:24.137 --> 19:26.180
...a map of our solar system...

19:26.389 --> 19:29.518
...population of the Earth.
Helpful facts like that.

19:30.853 --> 19:36.358
In January of 1993, Arecibo
received a message back...

19:37.234 --> 19:38.819
...from an extra terrestrial...

19:39.194 --> 19:40.612
...unknown source.

19:40.863 --> 19:42.030
That's great.

19:42.364 --> 19:44.700
Intelligent life beyond this planet?

19:44.908 --> 19:46.118
Yes.

19:46.702 --> 19:48.871
There were two communications.

19:49.079 --> 19:53.625
The first message turned out to be
a superior catalyst for methane.

19:53.876 --> 19:55.127
We now have the potential...

19:55.335 --> 19:58.547
...to produce infinite energy
from this clean-burning fuel.

19:59.423 --> 20:02.718
This convinced us we were dealing
with a friendly intelligence.

20:02.968 --> 20:07.389
The second message turned out
to be a new sequence of DNA...

20:07.890 --> 20:10.851
...with friendly instructions
on how to combine it with ours.

20:11.059 --> 20:15.063
Here's some technical data.
Get feedback from Dr. Baker.

20:15.314 --> 20:16.398
Basically...

20:16.607 --> 20:20.068
...the new combined
DNA sequence...

20:20.319 --> 20:22.529
...was injected into 100...

20:23.322 --> 20:25.032
...human ova.

20:28.369 --> 20:29.370
We got 7...

20:29.621 --> 20:30.747
...to divide.

20:30.997 --> 20:32.540
Four petered out.

20:32.957 --> 20:35.084
Two were stored in liquid nitrogen.

20:35.627 --> 20:37.754
And we allowed one to grow.

20:38.630 --> 20:40.757
Its code name is "Sil."

20:42.175 --> 20:43.760
That's after 2 hours.

20:45.303 --> 20:46.471
One day.

20:48.264 --> 20:49.265
Two days.

20:49.516 --> 20:51.935
- My God.
- This growth is amazing.

20:52.227 --> 20:53.603
A week.

20:55.271 --> 20:56.439
- It's a girl.
- Yes.

20:58.483 --> 21:01.444
We decided to make it female
so it would be more docile...

21:01.694 --> 21:04.656
...and controllable.
- More docile and controllable, huh?

21:05.490 --> 21:08.034
Well, I guess you guys
don't get out much.

21:09.661 --> 21:12.831
That's her 1 month
after she was born.

21:13.414 --> 21:16.000
So you kept her caged in there?

21:16.209 --> 21:18.628
It was safer to keep her isolated.

21:19.003 --> 21:20.964
She didn't like being locked up.

21:21.464 --> 21:22.966
She didn't like being alone.

21:23.383 --> 21:24.717
Didn't she?

21:28.931 --> 21:31.892
She's hiding something.
Something inside.

21:32.601 --> 21:33.978
You're right, Dan.

21:34.437 --> 21:38.399
This is three months after
she was born. Watch carefully.

21:40.526 --> 21:42.236
What the hell was that?

21:42.695 --> 21:43.904
Back the tape up.

21:47.283 --> 21:48.742
Watch her eyes.

21:49.368 --> 21:51.745
Rapid eye movement.
She's dreaming.

21:54.039 --> 21:58.335
- She's having horrible nightmares.
- It's some kind of anxiety reaction.

21:58.878 --> 22:00.129
Got me a little anxious.

22:00.379 --> 22:03.340
It made the research team
a little anxious too...

22:03.883 --> 22:06.927
...so the decision was made
to terminate the experiment...

22:07.553 --> 22:10.055
...to run more research to see
what we were dealing with.

22:13.225 --> 22:15.186
You were going to gas her?

22:15.770 --> 22:17.396
That was the decision.

22:19.231 --> 22:20.733
It makes you feel mad.

22:22.318 --> 22:24.821
You feel mad that you had to
kill her, don't you?

22:25.071 --> 22:26.364
I don't know.

22:33.747 --> 22:35.040
Yes.

22:39.628 --> 22:45.383
Yesterday the body of a transient was
found in a boxcar near Salt Lake City.

22:45.967 --> 22:48.345
Preliminary DNA tests conclude...

22:48.637 --> 22:51.765
...he was killed by our creation,
by our Sil.

22:52.057 --> 22:53.475
Found any other bodies?

22:53.725 --> 22:55.185
- Not yet.
- You will.

22:55.560 --> 22:57.062
She's a predator.

22:57.312 --> 22:58.980
Her eyes are in front...

23:00.273 --> 23:03.151
...so she can judge the distance
to her prey.

23:03.443 --> 23:04.486
That's right.

23:04.736 --> 23:06.071
Where'd you learn that?

23:06.696 --> 23:09.491
I saw it on the Discovery Channel.

23:11.034 --> 23:12.994
I caught that show myself.

23:13.745 --> 23:16.164
- Mr. Lennox.
- Yeah?

23:16.373 --> 23:17.791
As the...

23:18.166 --> 23:21.962
...non-scientist amongst us,
are you clear about what's going on?

23:22.922 --> 23:24.132
I think so.

23:25.758 --> 23:27.760
You created a monster...

23:28.344 --> 23:30.972
...with a formula you got
from outer space.

23:31.681 --> 23:35.268
The damn thing got away. Now you
want us to hunt it down and kill it.

23:36.769 --> 23:38.271
Now, is that pretty close?

23:38.813 --> 23:40.189
I guess.

23:40.440 --> 23:41.649
<i>You don't want us...</i>

23:41.941 --> 23:44.944
...to capture her alive
so that we can study her?

23:46.362 --> 23:50.700
Laura, I think this is strictly a
search and destroy operation.

23:52.160 --> 23:55.413
Nobody ever asked me to find
anything they didn't want dead.

23:56.789 --> 23:57.957
I'm sorry for you.

23:59.125 --> 24:00.960
Yeah, well...

24:01.169 --> 24:02.628
Thank you, Dan.

24:03.629 --> 24:05.131
I'm sorry for her.

24:07.842 --> 24:09.969
<i>May I have your attention, please?</i>

24:10.178 --> 24:14.390
<i>Welcome to Los Angeles. This is
the terminal stop for the Desert Star.</i>

24:14.640 --> 24:17.143
<i>All passengers please disembark.</i>

25:35.932 --> 25:37.892
Something bad happened here.

25:38.268 --> 25:40.061
- No shit.
- Crushed her larynx.

25:40.270 --> 25:41.938
She was afraid.

25:42.188 --> 25:44.566
She's scared, frightened.

25:44.774 --> 25:47.652
Hungry too.
She's been eating like a horse.

25:48.194 --> 25:50.488
Our girl is definitely not on a diet.

25:51.781 --> 25:53.950
She's storing calories for something.

25:54.200 --> 25:55.577
Any ideas?

25:57.203 --> 25:58.413
Oh, my...

26:00.248 --> 26:01.916
<i>Well, that's...</i>

26:02.542 --> 26:04.419
That looks like some sort of...

26:04.878 --> 26:07.464
...chrysalis. Some kind of cocoon.

26:07.922 --> 26:10.091
What are we looking for,
a giant moth?

26:12.760 --> 26:14.512
If that is a cocoon...

26:14.721 --> 26:17.223
...she'll be fully-grown now.
- Fully-grown.

26:17.432 --> 26:19.894
Maybe that's how
she got by our people.

26:20.144 --> 26:21.729
They were looking for a child.

26:22.104 --> 26:23.606
She is a child.

26:24.857 --> 26:27.651
It stinks in here. I'm going outside.

26:34.825 --> 26:38.579
Get the conductors' ID and credit card
numbers on your computer.

26:38.829 --> 26:40.831
There's no sign of them on the train.

26:41.332 --> 26:43.959
- Let's assume she took them.
- I'll see to that.

26:44.210 --> 26:45.836
She kills if she's threatened.

26:46.712 --> 26:49.465
And she has no remorse about it.
None.

26:49.715 --> 26:52.009
Of course, Los Angeles
is perfect for her.

26:52.343 --> 26:53.803
It's a city of the future.

26:54.011 --> 26:55.221
Anything goes.

26:55.429 --> 26:58.182
Totally mobile population.
Everyone's a stranger.

26:58.682 --> 27:00.434
Very little is taboo or unacceptable.

27:00.643 --> 27:02.645
Whatever she does,
no one will notice her.

27:02.853 --> 27:05.022
Well, whatever. So...

27:06.065 --> 27:08.984
Los Angeles is where the battle
will be fought...

27:10.402 --> 27:11.695
...and won.

27:37.472 --> 27:39.224
You look very pretty.

27:41.143 --> 27:42.519
Do you have a hundred?

27:45.063 --> 27:46.273
Here we are.

27:47.899 --> 27:52.195
Be more careful with your money.
Not everybody's as honest as me.

27:55.323 --> 27:56.700
Are you foreign?

28:00.078 --> 28:01.204
Do you speak English?

28:02.414 --> 28:05.709
- Yes.
- Here. You keep this.

28:07.085 --> 28:09.296
Here, let me take this.

28:10.630 --> 28:11.840
Be careful here.

28:12.174 --> 28:13.383
Yes.

28:19.432 --> 28:21.142
Watch your step.

28:33.529 --> 28:35.573
Our laboratory, Visitor Base One...

28:35.782 --> 28:40.244
...is being moved to some empty virus
research labs at the university.

28:40.453 --> 28:43.956
They're moving our equipment now.
It'll be operational by 8:00.

28:44.207 --> 28:47.418
Check into your rooms. Everyone out
front in 15 minutes. We'll go over.

28:47.627 --> 28:49.086
What will we do?

28:49.295 --> 28:51.589
Process the evidence from the train.

28:51.798 --> 28:55.301
Could we try growing this creature
with its own DNA?

28:55.510 --> 29:00.640
We do a version without ours this time
and investigate its vulnerabilities.

29:00.890 --> 29:01.933
That'd be good.

29:02.308 --> 29:04.644
- Then I could know how it feels.
- Makes sense.

29:04.894 --> 29:07.605
This human life form could be a mask.
Without the camouflage...

29:07.814 --> 29:10.775
You're right. At least we'd know
what we were dealing with.

30:08.584 --> 30:12.005
A couple of bozos just ran out.
I got a customer.

30:12.547 --> 30:15.508
- Yes, young lady. Can I help you?
- I want a room.

30:15.842 --> 30:20.555
62, including tax. That'll just
about cover the Honeymoon Suite.

30:40.074 --> 30:41.701
<i>Hi. Come here often?</i>

30:42.952 --> 30:44.245
<i>What's your sign?</i>

30:54.464 --> 30:56.424
<i>Tired of brunette?</i>

30:56.925 --> 30:58.343
<i>Change.</i>

30:58.593 --> 31:00.887
<i>Change the color of your hair.</i>

31:01.137 --> 31:02.388
<i>Color-Tress.</i>

31:10.648 --> 31:12.942
I've increased the magnification.

31:18.656 --> 31:22.284
When I pierce the cell,
the foreign DNA will be introduced.

31:33.337 --> 31:34.547
Shit!

31:35.172 --> 31:36.966
The camera's gone down.

31:38.217 --> 31:39.218
Excuse me.

31:40.136 --> 31:41.595
Do you have a replacement camera?

31:41.846 --> 31:45.433
We do, but it'll take time for
the technician to replace it.

31:45.683 --> 31:49.311
No. This happens in my lab
all the time. It's simple to replace it.

31:49.520 --> 31:51.230
You saying you can do it?

31:51.480 --> 31:54.191
Sure I can. I just need somebody
to give me a hand.

31:54.400 --> 31:57.611
I don't want technicians in there.
This is classified.

31:57.862 --> 31:59.071
I'll do it.

32:00.656 --> 32:01.824
I'll do it.

32:02.032 --> 32:04.952
- Man of action, I like that.
- That's me.

32:15.464 --> 32:17.466
Can you get that one for me?

32:40.697 --> 32:42.783
Give me the camera.

32:55.212 --> 32:58.215
Something's... Something's wrong.

33:04.346 --> 33:05.972
Christ, It's started already.

33:06.890 --> 33:09.644
- It's started. Get the top back on.
- What?

33:09.852 --> 33:11.938
Laura, Press, get the top back on.

33:13.231 --> 33:14.524
Here you go.

33:15.691 --> 33:17.485
She must have penetrated the cell.

33:19.445 --> 33:20.530
- Shit.
- What was that?

33:20.738 --> 33:21.823
He dropped the bolt.

33:23.741 --> 33:26.494
- Find the bolt. Get the top on.
- I'm looking, Fitch.

33:28.454 --> 33:29.914
Can they hear me in there?

33:30.123 --> 33:31.374
Laura, Press...

33:31.874 --> 33:34.669
<i>...get the top on, then I'll let you out.
- Where'd it go?</i>

33:38.798 --> 33:41.342
- It fell through the grate.
- Can you lift it up?

33:44.804 --> 33:47.014
- It's not gonna move.
- This isn't going anywhere.

33:47.265 --> 33:48.724
- No, can't get it!
- Press...

33:48.933 --> 33:50.726
...you gotta get the bolt!

33:50.935 --> 33:54.772
- Can't get it. The floor's welded down.
- Oh, my God.

33:55.148 --> 33:56.732
Press. Oh, my God.

33:56.941 --> 33:59.068
- I've never seen anything like this.
- Holy shit.

33:59.318 --> 34:00.653
I can't let them out.

34:00.862 --> 34:03.281
- Press, look.
- Come on.

34:04.782 --> 34:06.243
Fitch, let us out of here!

34:06.743 --> 34:08.328
Open the goddamn door!

34:08.579 --> 34:11.706
- Not until I know what's in there!
- Open it now!

34:11.915 --> 34:13.417
- Let them out.
- I can't!

34:13.625 --> 34:15.878
- Open up the fucking door!
- Let us out!

34:16.253 --> 34:19.922
- Tell me it'll stop growing, Dan.
- It's not, let them out!

34:23.217 --> 34:24.969
Open up the door!

34:25.179 --> 34:26.638
Press, Press.

34:28.139 --> 34:29.516
What the fuck is that?!

34:29.766 --> 34:32.101
Laura, get to the other door!

34:32.436 --> 34:34.353
- Let her out, Fitch!
- I can't!

34:34.646 --> 34:36.398
- Let her out!
- I can't!

34:36.648 --> 34:38.275
- You motherfucker!
- Let her out!

34:38.484 --> 34:40.944
- You've gotta let them out!
- I can't hold it in!

34:41.195 --> 34:42.446
Get out of the way!

34:42.654 --> 34:44.614
I'm gonna burn it!
Out of the way!

34:48.327 --> 34:51.413
- What is this thing?
- In 2 minutes, I'm burning the room!

34:52.039 --> 34:53.791
I have to do it!

34:54.041 --> 34:55.458
You have two minutes to kill it.

34:56.001 --> 34:58.879
Disconnect the gas line.
Use it as a flamethrower.

35:06.095 --> 35:07.555
Laura, watch out!

35:10.517 --> 35:12.102
- Where'd it go?
- In the pipes!

35:12.352 --> 35:13.812
- Open the door!
- Shut up, Dan!

35:17.524 --> 35:19.317
<i>One minute remaining.</i>

35:31.538 --> 35:32.914
Laura...

35:33.373 --> 35:35.667
...it stopped moving. I think I killed it.

35:36.960 --> 35:38.711
It's dead! Open the door!

35:38.962 --> 35:40.672
It's dead, Fitch. Let them out.

35:44.717 --> 35:47.470
Oh, God, it's not dead.

35:55.061 --> 35:56.980
- Shit.
- What'll we do?

35:57.230 --> 35:58.690
<i>30 seconds remaining.</i>

35:58.898 --> 36:01.526
- There's not much time. Let's go.
- Open the door!

36:01.734 --> 36:03.446
- Let them out.
- I can't do that.

36:03.696 --> 36:05.573
- I have to follow protocol!
- What protocol?!

36:05.823 --> 36:07.575
The protocols by which
we're doing this!

36:07.908 --> 36:10.453
You didn't tell them that
before they went in.

36:10.870 --> 36:13.122
<i>- Fitch, let them out.
- Twelve, 11, 10...</i>

36:13.330 --> 36:15.875
- Fitch, let them out!
- I must follow protocol.

36:16.083 --> 36:17.334
Let them out, Fitch!

36:17.668 --> 36:19.879
Go. Get out of there!

36:20.588 --> 36:23.048
<i>Three, two, one.</i>

36:23.257 --> 36:25.009
- I had no choice.
- Yeah, sure.

36:25.217 --> 36:28.596
The protocol is to burn the room
if anything went wrong!

36:49.492 --> 36:51.410
Where's a good place
to find a man?

36:51.827 --> 36:55.664
There's plenty of guys at the Id
around the corner. It's a club.

36:55.915 --> 36:58.209
You won't have trouble
meeting somebody there.

36:58.417 --> 36:59.418
Thank you.

37:00.044 --> 37:02.130
You can't miss it.
Look for the long line.

37:02.380 --> 37:04.424
I need your credit card...

37:04.800 --> 37:08.303
...for room incidentals,
long distance calls and so forth.

37:08.553 --> 37:10.263
Credit card? Zip zap?

37:10.722 --> 37:12.933
American Express, Visa,
MasterCard?

37:13.475 --> 37:15.852
There you go. Thanks. All right.

37:16.186 --> 37:17.187
Thank you.

37:18.146 --> 37:19.439
Wait a minute!

37:23.819 --> 37:26.696
You don't want this falling
into the wrong hands.

37:27.030 --> 37:28.365
No.

37:30.283 --> 37:33.870
<i>Here's Justin Crawl. It's through
and it's covered by the goalie.</i>

37:36.164 --> 37:37.165
Yeah?

37:37.415 --> 37:39.167
The conductor's credit card
turned up...

37:39.376 --> 37:42.003
...in a Hollywood motel.
The van's out front.

37:42.254 --> 37:43.463
<i>Let's go.</i>

37:47.092 --> 37:48.301
You two.

37:53.682 --> 37:54.975
Enjoy yourselves.

37:55.600 --> 37:58.645
You, legs. You're in. Go on.

38:20.877 --> 38:22.670
Where are you from?

38:24.046 --> 38:26.215
- I'm foreign.
- You're what?

38:26.466 --> 38:28.509
- I'm foreign.
- Really?

38:29.385 --> 38:30.511
Easy, easy.

38:30.720 --> 38:33.556
I've got a party to go to
and no one to take me.

38:33.764 --> 38:35.141
I'll take you.

38:35.349 --> 38:36.767
- You will?
- Yeah.

38:36.976 --> 38:39.020
Okay. I'm going
to the little girls' room.

38:40.313 --> 38:41.939
Wait right here.

38:42.398 --> 38:43.858
I'll be right back.

38:44.066 --> 38:45.526
I'll be right here.

39:04.546 --> 39:06.423
Whatever it takes, right?

39:07.633 --> 39:09.843
All's fair in love and war.

39:35.327 --> 39:36.578
Can't see much on that.

39:36.829 --> 39:39.456
Get this tape to the lab. Enhance it.

39:39.915 --> 39:41.625
See if we can get a better look.

39:42.251 --> 39:43.627
She looks nice.

39:44.169 --> 39:46.255
Do you have any idea
where she went?

39:46.505 --> 39:50.008
- I'll find her.
- She wanted to meet a man.

39:50.259 --> 39:52.970
I suggested a club called
the Id around the corner.

39:54.972 --> 39:56.306
Get the tape.

40:15.869 --> 40:18.496
I've got a party to go to
and no one to take me.

40:19.038 --> 40:20.790
Where is this party?

40:21.499 --> 40:22.667
I don't know.

40:32.510 --> 40:34.637
Whoa, you can't park there!

40:35.138 --> 40:36.598
Back that out!

40:37.223 --> 40:40.477
- No, you can't go in there.
- What's going on?!

40:55.909 --> 40:59.163
- There's been a murder!
- No one leaves here! I mean, nobody!

41:02.708 --> 41:05.336
There's always some action
in this part of town.

41:18.516 --> 41:19.517
<i>Blue-eyed blonde.</i>

41:19.767 --> 41:23.687
Black leggings, pink sweater, 5' 10"
tall. Who'd she leave with?

41:23.938 --> 41:26.524
Blonde leaves with a guy
is hardly news around here.

41:26.774 --> 41:28.692
Name the top attractions. No losers.

41:28.943 --> 41:31.237
Assume he's socially adept.
He'll be helping her out.

41:31.445 --> 41:33.489
A friendly guy, not an asshole.

41:33.739 --> 41:35.366
I'm thinking.

41:35.950 --> 41:38.327
- Robbie left with a blonde.
- That's him.

41:39.453 --> 41:40.663
That's him.

41:41.080 --> 41:43.541
Come on. Let me show you
the rest of the house.

41:44.250 --> 41:46.544
I'm still sweaty from that place.

41:46.794 --> 41:48.212
It's so crowded.

41:53.592 --> 41:54.761
Like it?

41:56.221 --> 41:57.222
Yes.

41:57.430 --> 41:58.932
I feel like a shower.

41:59.933 --> 42:01.101
You want one?

42:02.310 --> 42:03.395
Tell you what.

42:03.645 --> 42:05.063
I'm taking one.

42:05.313 --> 42:06.982
You wanna take one later...

42:07.274 --> 42:08.650
...no problem.

42:52.652 --> 42:54.280
Take off your clothes.

42:56.282 --> 42:57.617
I want to see you.

43:05.124 --> 43:06.626
Very nice.

43:17.220 --> 43:18.554
Take me back.

43:18.763 --> 43:20.681
What are you talking about?

43:20.973 --> 43:22.683
You know why we came here.

43:23.476 --> 43:24.644
I've changed my mind.

43:24.852 --> 43:27.271
All right. You said "no."

43:27.814 --> 43:30.066
It's duly noted. Come here.

43:30.316 --> 43:31.359
I wanna go!

43:31.567 --> 43:34.612
Too late. You're not leaving!
You're not!

43:37.573 --> 43:40.284
- All right.
- That's better.

45:09.292 --> 45:12.796
What's happening? Kills a girl
at the club, kills this guy.

45:13.046 --> 45:16.049
I'd say she fits the definition
of a psychopath.

45:16.299 --> 45:18.092
Nothing inhibits her.

45:18.551 --> 45:21.012
No moral sense, no social structure.

45:21.805 --> 45:25.391
She wasn't exactly smothered with a
mother's love or taught good manners.

45:25.642 --> 45:27.352
I asked what was happening.

45:27.894 --> 45:29.729
He did something, she was angry.

45:29.979 --> 45:32.899
She'll kill if she's threatened
or if anyone gets in her way.

45:33.149 --> 45:34.317
Of what?

45:34.567 --> 45:35.777
Her life cycle.

45:36.069 --> 45:38.113
I think she's trying to mate.

45:38.488 --> 45:39.489
Reproduce.

45:39.781 --> 45:41.116
Okay.

45:41.324 --> 45:43.076
So why did she kill the girl?

45:43.326 --> 45:45.078
Sexual competition.

45:45.328 --> 45:46.830
She's hard on the competition.

45:47.205 --> 45:48.456
Now she managed to mate.

45:49.083 --> 45:52.753
Doesn't look like a success.
He's still got his pants on.

45:53.003 --> 45:55.256
- She's frustrated.
- Who isn't?

45:55.506 --> 45:58.092
What's her problem?
She was here with him.

45:58.342 --> 45:59.927
Maybe she rejected him.

46:00.177 --> 46:02.054
She probably has special senses.

46:02.263 --> 46:06.517
Rats can sense diseased or genetic
damage in their potential mates...

46:06.767 --> 46:08.185
...so we can test his body...

46:08.435 --> 46:12.982
...for hereditary diseases or defects
that would make him a loser...

46:13.190 --> 46:14.483
...essentially.

46:14.775 --> 46:15.985
Needles.

46:16.694 --> 46:19.738
Maybe he was a doper,
or a diabetic.

46:20.030 --> 46:22.825
Either way would make him
unacceptable. Excuse me.

46:24.952 --> 46:26.162
All right.

46:28.456 --> 46:30.666
Insulin. Diabetic.
There you have it.

46:30.875 --> 46:33.544
She could have just walked out.
Why kill him?

46:33.794 --> 46:35.880
He pissed her off.

46:36.130 --> 46:38.549
Some men, when rejected,
get insistent.

46:38.799 --> 46:41.385
- Put an APB out on his car.
- We have.

46:41.635 --> 46:44.597
We'll go back to the motel.
I want to check it out.

46:44.972 --> 46:47.851
More docile and controllable,
huh, Fitch?

47:02.449 --> 47:04.951
- What do you think, Dan?
- What do I think?

47:05.827 --> 47:08.538
I think she'd want to be alone now.

47:09.206 --> 47:12.542
She won't come here with
all these cars outside.

47:12.751 --> 47:15.712
You're assuming she could
find her way back here.

47:15.921 --> 47:17.130
She could.

47:17.756 --> 47:18.965
What is it?

47:20.592 --> 47:22.511
Maybe menstrual blood.

47:23.428 --> 47:26.056
If she's menstruating,
she can reproduce.

47:26.264 --> 47:27.516
Yes, I know.

49:04.364 --> 49:05.657
Shit.

49:11.205 --> 49:12.664
Oh, Jesus.

49:12.915 --> 49:14.124
Excuse me.

49:15.083 --> 49:17.836
Call a paramedic! Anybody
got a phone?

49:23.425 --> 49:26.261
<i>If your commute takes you westbound
on the 10 freeway...</i>

49:26.512 --> 49:28.013
<i>...expect an hour delay.</i>

49:28.263 --> 49:30.641
<i>The drive will be slow to Malibu.</i>

49:37.606 --> 49:40.109
The video enhancement
is not that great.

49:40.359 --> 49:42.486
How old do you think she is?
Twenty, 23?

49:44.364 --> 49:46.825
Her reproductive system
should be fully developed.

49:47.075 --> 49:49.035
Her biological clock must be
in hyperdrive.

49:49.285 --> 49:50.370
She wants a baby.

49:50.578 --> 49:53.289
If she has a child our problems
have just begun.

49:53.540 --> 49:56.584
If her offspring is male and develops
at the same rate as Sil...

49:57.877 --> 50:00.421
...it could reproduce in 6 months.

50:01.798 --> 50:04.259
God knows how many females
it could impregnate.

50:04.467 --> 50:05.927
Fitch.

50:08.471 --> 50:10.557
When a predatory species
is introduced...

50:10.765 --> 50:12.392
...into a closed ecological system...

50:12.600 --> 50:15.645
...the extinction of the weaker species
is inevitable.

50:15.854 --> 50:18.565
They found the murdered guy's BMW,
out of gas in Santa Monica.

50:18.940 --> 50:20.024
What's her name?

50:20.275 --> 50:22.402
- I don't know.
- Who are you?

50:22.652 --> 50:26.698
She didn't have any ID.
I thought I'd make sure she was okay.

50:26.948 --> 50:28.700
You think she's got insurance?

50:28.950 --> 50:32.454
I don't know. Just put it on
my credit card for now.

50:32.996 --> 50:36.624
And you don't know her name.
Guys like you are hard to find.

50:43.966 --> 50:46.469
Get a lab workup on that, stat.

50:49.346 --> 50:52.057
Get her up to x-ray.
I want an x-ray on this.

50:52.308 --> 50:54.643
It looks like a scapula fracture.

51:04.153 --> 51:05.780
Your shoulder wound.

51:09.158 --> 51:10.951
What's going on here?

51:16.373 --> 51:18.918
Doctor, we need you now.
A child burn victim just came in.

51:19.126 --> 51:20.961
- What is going on here?
- Doctor, please.

51:21.170 --> 51:23.756
Jesus Christ!
Did you see her shoulder?

51:23.964 --> 51:26.008
Please. We need you immediately.

51:34.892 --> 51:36.185
You're okay.

51:36.519 --> 51:37.603
I'm okay.

51:37.853 --> 51:40.357
I was sure you were
seriously injured.

51:40.899 --> 51:42.025
I'm okay.

51:42.359 --> 51:44.319
You are. It's a miracle.

51:45.237 --> 51:46.321
Can we go?

51:46.571 --> 51:49.282
Did the doctor say you could go?

51:49.533 --> 51:50.700
Yes.

51:52.119 --> 51:54.621
We'll send somebody over there.
Thanks a lot.

51:57.374 --> 52:01.837
Doctor over at Parkbay Hospital
called in with some weird story.

52:02.045 --> 52:04.172
We should check it out.
It's a few miles away.

52:04.548 --> 52:05.799
Laura...

52:06.216 --> 52:08.343
...Press, take a car, check it out.

52:08.552 --> 52:11.138
- Parkbay Hospital?
- Yeah, Parkbay.

52:13.515 --> 52:14.683
She walked.

52:15.767 --> 52:16.768
She walked.

52:18.562 --> 52:19.855
She walked that way...

52:21.398 --> 52:22.691
...not too long ago.

52:31.032 --> 52:32.826
Got some fruit and cheese.

52:35.078 --> 52:36.288
What is that?

52:36.705 --> 52:38.206
You mean the hot tub?

52:39.208 --> 52:40.376
A hot tub.

52:40.918 --> 52:42.253
I love this place.

52:42.462 --> 52:45.339
It's away from the traffic
and business and people.

52:45.715 --> 52:48.342
Sometimes it feels like
you're not in L.A. Anymore.

52:48.885 --> 52:50.052
Here.

52:50.386 --> 52:52.180
We'll immortalize the moment.

53:02.315 --> 53:03.608
Look at the camera.

53:09.113 --> 53:12.533
- This girl literally reformed her bones.
- It's her.

53:13.576 --> 53:14.869
Who checked her in?

53:15.161 --> 53:16.996
I don't know. Let's find out.

53:17.246 --> 53:20.625
She had no insurance so this guy
put it on his own credit card.

53:22.585 --> 53:24.879
Here's the file. John F. Carey.

53:26.088 --> 53:29.759
You don't have a driver's license
or home address?

53:29.967 --> 53:33.471
No, sir.
Just an imprint of his credit card.

53:34.430 --> 53:36.516
Give us a printout
of what you've got.

53:36.766 --> 53:38.060
No problem.

53:41.313 --> 53:42.523
Some candy?

53:52.533 --> 53:55.786
It's in the Palisades and
he's got a phone number.

53:56.495 --> 53:59.498
Tell Fitch where we're headed,
and try to get John Carey on the line.

54:29.570 --> 54:31.363
I'd better get the phone.

54:38.705 --> 54:41.040
I've got his machine.
Should I leave a message?

54:41.249 --> 54:42.542
Yeah.

54:42.750 --> 54:46.171
Tell him he's about to copulate
with a creature from outer space.

54:47.213 --> 54:49.048
- Copulate, huh?
- Yeah.

54:50.717 --> 54:51.926
I like you.

54:52.218 --> 54:53.428
I know.

54:58.391 --> 55:00.602
It's not too soon for us
to be together.

55:02.145 --> 55:03.938
No, it's not too soon.

55:05.982 --> 55:07.442
You don't need these.

55:07.734 --> 55:09.903
Hey, hey. That's a little fast.

55:23.333 --> 55:24.626
What's the matter?

55:25.251 --> 55:26.544
Take it easy.

55:29.422 --> 55:30.882
Just relax.

55:32.592 --> 55:33.885
There's plenty of time.

55:42.686 --> 55:43.896
What is it?

55:46.607 --> 55:48.609
I think someone's at the door.

55:48.818 --> 55:50.027
Don't go.

55:50.778 --> 55:52.863
Please. I want a baby.

55:53.197 --> 55:55.407
What?! Excuse me?

56:05.626 --> 56:07.419
Let's go around the side.

56:50.797 --> 56:51.965
<i>Outside.</i>

58:49.668 --> 58:52.754
- What happened?
- A squirrel! A fucking squirrel!

58:53.005 --> 58:55.424
- She was here.
- Yeah, she was.

58:55.674 --> 58:57.801
I wanna make sure
she's not still here.

59:24.995 --> 59:28.207
Perhaps we should check the body
for evidence that they've had sex.

59:35.673 --> 59:37.967
I used to be scared
at the sight of blood.

59:38.843 --> 59:40.637
Now I guess I'm getting used to it.

59:41.930 --> 59:43.389
Oh, yes.

01:00:09.207 --> 01:00:11.960
- Help me, please!
- Oh, my God. What's the matter?

01:00:13.002 --> 01:00:14.796
We found this in the living room.

01:00:16.714 --> 01:00:17.966
She liked him.

01:00:19.884 --> 01:00:21.511
Well, not enough.

01:00:22.220 --> 01:00:25.306
Can't see any more on that than
we did on the video monitor.

01:00:25.849 --> 01:00:27.768
He didn't get a good picture of her.

01:00:27.977 --> 01:00:31.021
There's no evidence of semen
in the hot tub water.

01:00:31.522 --> 01:00:33.023
Maybe she took it with.

01:00:33.232 --> 01:00:35.359
So she probably
hasn't managed to mate.

01:00:35.651 --> 01:00:38.654
- We interrupted her.
- Yes, I think we did.

01:00:38.904 --> 01:00:40.865
Give me something I can use.

01:00:42.366 --> 01:00:44.201
What have you
come up with lately, Fitch?

01:00:49.915 --> 01:00:51.375
She's not scared of us.

01:00:51.834 --> 01:00:53.043
That's for sure.

01:00:56.964 --> 01:00:58.424
We're all beat.

01:00:58.799 --> 01:01:00.634
We'll go back to the hotel and rest.

01:01:01.594 --> 01:01:03.095
Tomorrow night...

01:01:03.512 --> 01:01:05.222
...we'll go back to the club.

01:01:06.432 --> 01:01:08.058
<i>- Stake it out.
- Stake it out.</i>

01:01:11.187 --> 01:01:12.396
She's not stupid.

01:01:12.605 --> 01:01:14.106
She won't repeat herself.

01:01:14.356 --> 01:01:17.568
There's no point going there.
It provided a poor specimen.

01:01:17.818 --> 01:01:18.819
I'm not sure.

01:01:19.069 --> 01:01:21.739
She's been in the city two days.
It's what she knows.

01:01:21.947 --> 01:01:23.616
<i>I'd rather try the club...</i>

01:01:23.866 --> 01:01:28.246
...than sit at the command center
reminiscing about how close we got.

01:01:41.676 --> 01:01:44.429
She would make one excellent
biological weapon.

01:01:44.679 --> 01:01:48.600
If someone thought we were some
kind of galactic weed that would...

01:01:48.850 --> 01:01:50.811
...spread through the universe.

01:01:51.978 --> 01:01:54.147
<i>So what you're saying is that...</i>

01:01:54.523 --> 01:01:56.775
...she's the cure and
we're the disease.

01:01:57.317 --> 01:01:58.777
That's well said.

01:01:59.903 --> 01:02:01.404
"Baker, Laura.

01:02:01.655 --> 01:02:05.325
1735 Meander Drive,
Simi v alley, california."

01:02:05.575 --> 01:02:06.952
That's you, right?

01:02:07.744 --> 01:02:09.454
Last time I checked.

01:02:09.913 --> 01:02:11.832
What do you do for kicks out there?

01:02:14.084 --> 01:02:16.086
Pine for guys like you.

01:02:16.336 --> 01:02:18.463
That's what I thought.

01:02:39.402 --> 01:02:40.736
So anyone hungry?

01:02:41.612 --> 01:02:45.158
No, thanks. I'm beat.
I'm gonna try to get some sleep.

01:02:45.408 --> 01:02:47.577
- Good night.
- Yeah. Night.

01:02:48.911 --> 01:02:52.039
- I'll have something to eat with you.
- Thanks, Dan.

01:03:54.645 --> 01:03:57.147
- Do you ever have nightmares?
- Yes.

01:03:57.981 --> 01:04:00.067
Please untie my hands.

01:04:00.484 --> 01:04:03.278
- I wouldn't hurt you. Please.
- I have them.

01:04:06.782 --> 01:04:08.325
I think they tell me who I am.

01:04:09.118 --> 01:04:10.911
Why are you doing this to me?

01:04:13.664 --> 01:04:15.415
I don't know why I'm here.

01:04:15.666 --> 01:04:18.085
I don't know who I am, who sent me.

01:04:19.962 --> 01:04:21.923
- Do you?
- No!

01:04:25.468 --> 01:04:28.429
- Why do you think you're here?
- I don't know.

01:04:29.472 --> 01:04:31.057
Please let me go.

01:04:31.307 --> 01:04:33.643
Please. Please, let me go.

01:04:36.062 --> 01:04:37.939
I wouldn't hurt you.

01:04:38.314 --> 01:04:39.858
I promise.

01:04:40.066 --> 01:04:42.193
- I wouldn't hurt you.
- Yes, you would.

01:04:43.153 --> 01:04:44.529
You just don't know it yet.

01:04:45.572 --> 01:04:47.782
No, I wouldn't!

01:04:47.991 --> 01:04:49.367
Please!

01:04:50.994 --> 01:04:53.371
My hands are hurting me.

01:04:57.667 --> 01:04:58.960
Thank you.

01:04:59.794 --> 01:05:01.129
Thank you.

01:05:07.760 --> 01:05:09.345
Oh, my God!

01:05:25.613 --> 01:05:27.072
Oh, my God, no!

01:05:28.365 --> 01:05:30.784
No! No!

01:07:29.906 --> 01:07:31.866
Laura and Press,
they like each other.

01:07:32.325 --> 01:07:34.160
They just don't like to show
how they feel.

01:07:34.368 --> 01:07:35.703
What?

01:07:36.621 --> 01:07:39.123
Laura and Press,
they like each other.

01:07:39.540 --> 01:07:41.250
Yeah, whatever you say, Dan.

01:07:41.501 --> 01:07:44.629
Look, it's really smoky in here.
I'm gonna go outside, get some air.

01:07:45.046 --> 01:07:49.175
Think I'll lie down in the van. Have a
rest. This is a complete waste of time.

01:07:52.053 --> 01:07:53.888
Get a feeling you're on
a wild goose chase?

01:07:54.096 --> 01:07:55.473
Yeah.

01:07:56.682 --> 01:07:57.850
Excuse me.

01:08:58.578 --> 01:09:01.372
Get out of here. This is my trashcan.

01:09:12.676 --> 01:09:13.886
It's you.

01:09:21.144 --> 01:09:22.228
Hey!

01:09:23.145 --> 01:09:25.189
She's here! Hey!

01:09:31.571 --> 01:09:33.406
- Dan. Is that her?
- Yeah.

01:09:33.615 --> 01:09:34.782
Here.

01:09:41.288 --> 01:09:42.832
Get in the van.

01:09:44.834 --> 01:09:46.711
Everybody get in the van!

01:09:55.303 --> 01:09:58.264
They're heading into the hills.
We'll need the helicopters.

01:10:09.859 --> 01:10:14.323
We're going up Nichols canyon. One
of you try to block her at Mulholland.

01:10:31.423 --> 01:10:32.800
Watch it!

01:11:34.404 --> 01:11:36.072
Oh, my God!

01:12:11.234 --> 01:12:14.946
We blocked the road.
We've gotta tell the press something.

01:12:15.196 --> 01:12:18.032
Tell them what you want,
just don't tell them the truth.

01:12:18.282 --> 01:12:21.494
I don't buy her showing up at
the club. It's too damn convenient.

01:12:22.078 --> 01:12:24.539
Seeing is believing or
don't you trust your eyes?

01:12:24.789 --> 01:12:26.916
Get back! Get all these people back!

01:12:27.208 --> 01:12:30.169
Fitch. Fitch. It doesn't feel right.

01:12:30.545 --> 01:12:31.754
Sir!

01:12:31.963 --> 01:12:35.633
We found a severed thumb in
one of the doors that got ripped off.

01:12:35.883 --> 01:12:39.053
- Let me see that.
- She may have caught it in the door.

01:12:39.303 --> 01:12:41.264
Get to the lab, see if it's hers.

01:12:41.722 --> 01:12:44.725
- It'll be genetically identifiable.
- It's all over, everyone.

01:12:44.934 --> 01:12:47.228
Tomorrow you can go back
to your lives.

01:12:47.478 --> 01:12:49.772
Congratulations on a job well done.

01:12:53.317 --> 01:12:55.278
Just like that, huh, Fitch?

01:12:55.987 --> 01:12:57.446
I don't think so.

01:13:08.208 --> 01:13:11.795
<i>Leave me a message.
And Frank, I'm going to dinner.</i>

01:13:12.004 --> 01:13:14.631
<i>Where are we meeting?
Bye, sweetie.</i>

01:13:17.342 --> 01:13:18.510
Waiter.

01:13:20.053 --> 01:13:21.472
Well, I guess we won.

01:13:22.848 --> 01:13:26.852
- We won, science lost.
- I didn't think we'd get her this way.

01:13:27.853 --> 01:13:29.938
- Not that easy.
- You sound like you'll miss her.

01:13:30.147 --> 01:13:31.273
I guess I will.

01:13:32.232 --> 01:13:33.859
I think I respected her.

01:13:36.361 --> 01:13:40.657
I know this was a hellish job, but I
really enjoyed working with you three.

01:13:40.908 --> 01:13:43.785
And since Uncle Sam is buying,
let's have another round.

01:13:43.994 --> 01:13:44.995
Waiter!

01:13:45.329 --> 01:13:47.164
I don't... I don't drink.

01:13:47.539 --> 01:13:49.124
Don't worry, Dan. Tonight you will.

01:13:51.210 --> 01:13:52.669
You wanna dance?

01:13:52.878 --> 01:13:54.963
- Who, me?
- Yeah, you.

01:13:58.175 --> 01:14:00.302
- All right.
- Okay.

01:14:16.361 --> 01:14:20.990
I know you don't have a family.
Do you have a girlfriend in New York?

01:14:22.075 --> 01:14:25.495
I guess I've had a few, but
they don't hang around very long.

01:14:26.371 --> 01:14:28.498
I guess I keep too many secrets.

01:14:29.165 --> 01:14:30.542
You wanna share one with me?

01:14:31.543 --> 01:14:32.877
- Right now?
- Yeah.

01:14:38.424 --> 01:14:41.803
I know what you do,
and it doesn't scare me.

01:14:42.053 --> 01:14:44.222
- Really?
- No.

01:14:44.722 --> 01:14:46.432
Well, it does most people.

01:14:51.146 --> 01:14:53.523
I wouldn't wanna
never see you again.

01:15:00.864 --> 01:15:02.073
- Hey.
- What are you...?

01:15:02.282 --> 01:15:06.162
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I thought you were somebody else.

01:15:06.370 --> 01:15:07.746
I'm sorry.

01:15:09.707 --> 01:15:10.916
You okay?

01:15:11.125 --> 01:15:13.711
I thought it was Sil.
I saw the blonde hair.

01:15:13.961 --> 01:15:15.421
She's dead, Press.

01:15:15.629 --> 01:15:18.132
The tests on the thumb
proved it was her.

01:15:18.382 --> 01:15:21.552
You got your test and I got my gut.
I just don't buy it.

01:15:22.303 --> 01:15:26.265
I think as long as you feel
she's out there, you got a mission.

01:15:26.474 --> 01:15:28.934
Maybe you don't want
this job to be over.

01:15:29.727 --> 01:15:31.854
Well, maybe not. So what?

01:15:35.316 --> 01:15:36.942
Thanks for the dance.

01:15:51.457 --> 01:15:52.625
Good night.

01:15:59.715 --> 01:16:00.925
What do you call this?

01:16:01.342 --> 01:16:03.469
It's called a Long Island Ice Tea.

01:16:04.805 --> 01:16:06.097
It's got tea in it?

01:16:07.140 --> 01:16:08.308
Nope.

01:16:25.826 --> 01:16:27.786
Smells nice, can I try some?

01:16:28.662 --> 01:16:30.121
Help yourself.

01:16:35.377 --> 01:16:37.129
Does it work on your boyfriend?

01:16:37.379 --> 01:16:39.297
Yeah. As a repellent.

01:16:43.218 --> 01:16:46.638
I don't know. I think he's in remarkably
good shape for a man his age.

01:16:58.358 --> 01:17:00.402
One Long Island Ice Tea.

01:17:02.697 --> 01:17:04.907
I like these cups of tea.

01:17:07.243 --> 01:17:09.203
- What?
- That's great.

01:17:15.251 --> 01:17:17.086
Hey, give me one of those.

01:17:17.962 --> 01:17:20.548
I like these cups of tea, man.

01:17:21.466 --> 01:17:23.718
You guys, I'm tired.
I'm gonna go to bed.

01:17:27.096 --> 01:17:28.264
So?

01:17:29.974 --> 01:17:31.225
She's going to bed.

01:17:31.476 --> 01:17:32.768
I guess.

01:17:34.812 --> 01:17:36.439
She still...

01:17:37.440 --> 01:17:39.192
...wants to see you though.

01:17:42.945 --> 01:17:45.406
Maybe I'll go find out
if you're right about that.

01:18:11.558 --> 01:18:13.685
I'd hate to be in here
during an earthquake.

01:18:13.894 --> 01:18:15.187
Yeah.

01:18:15.646 --> 01:18:17.189
What floor do you want?

01:18:17.648 --> 01:18:19.274
Ten, please.

01:18:29.159 --> 01:18:31.203
I like your perfume.

01:18:31.829 --> 01:18:32.996
You do?

01:18:33.664 --> 01:18:36.875
- Thank you.
- Excuse me. I get out here.

01:18:41.088 --> 01:18:42.297
Good night.

01:19:19.294 --> 01:19:21.296
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:19:38.980 --> 01:19:40.523
Did you want something?

01:19:41.483 --> 01:19:43.943
- Maybe.
- Maybe?

01:20:29.573 --> 01:20:31.158
Housekeeping.

01:20:32.618 --> 01:20:35.538
Dan. Dan.

01:20:35.746 --> 01:20:38.874
Those two over there.
Bet they like unusual men like us.

01:20:40.251 --> 01:20:42.086
Women think I'm strange.

01:20:42.628 --> 01:20:43.963
I don't feel well.

01:20:44.505 --> 01:20:46.048
Don't be silly.

01:20:46.590 --> 01:20:48.634
Just go over there and talk to them.

01:20:48.926 --> 01:20:52.054
I have to go. And I think
you should leave with me, okay?

01:20:54.640 --> 01:20:57.018
I'm gonna stay for a while, actually.

01:20:59.646 --> 01:21:00.814
Okay.

01:21:01.940 --> 01:21:03.316
I'll see you tomorrow.

01:21:06.361 --> 01:21:08.196
Housekeeping.

01:21:22.752 --> 01:21:24.004
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:21:24.212 --> 01:21:26.590
I was sitting over there, wondering...

01:21:26.840 --> 01:21:30.343
...what two intelligent, glamorous
women were doing without dates.

01:21:30.594 --> 01:21:32.095
My name's Stephen Arden.

01:21:32.345 --> 01:21:34.431
I teach anthropology at Harvard.

01:21:34.681 --> 01:21:36.266
- I lived in Boston once.
- Yeah?

01:21:36.516 --> 01:21:37.684
For a year.

01:21:37.893 --> 01:21:40.770
- Froze my butt off.
- It's cold in Boston.

01:21:41.021 --> 01:21:43.398
This is Bill and Tony.
I forget your name.

01:21:49.154 --> 01:21:50.614
Cute little socks.

01:21:52.365 --> 01:21:53.783
Stand up.

01:22:33.783 --> 01:22:35.326
How'd you get in here?

01:22:35.701 --> 01:22:37.870
- I stole the key.
- What?

01:22:38.412 --> 01:22:41.165
I saw you downstairs, but
you were with all those people.

01:22:42.041 --> 01:22:43.709
So I thought I'd come up and wait.

01:22:47.380 --> 01:22:49.674
This kind of thing doesn't
usually happen to me.

01:22:51.551 --> 01:22:53.052
I just want to be with you.

01:23:03.689 --> 01:23:05.232
Oh, yes.

01:23:19.580 --> 01:23:20.956
What about protection?

01:24:16.387 --> 01:24:18.348
She's here. She's here.

01:24:47.418 --> 01:24:48.837
Press?

01:24:49.212 --> 01:24:50.881
Someone's at the door.

01:24:52.842 --> 01:24:53.843
Who's there?

01:24:54.093 --> 01:24:55.302
Press, Laura.

01:24:55.511 --> 01:24:57.513
It's Dan. I gotta talk to you.

01:24:57.930 --> 01:25:00.349
Christ, what does he want?

01:25:10.317 --> 01:25:13.154
- What's the problem, Dan?
- I just got this terrible feeling.

01:25:13.404 --> 01:25:16.490
I get this strange thought,
this image of Sil with Arden.

01:25:16.740 --> 01:25:18.117
Sil's next door with Arden, Press.

01:25:18.576 --> 01:25:20.828
No, no, no. She's dead, Dan.

01:25:21.245 --> 01:25:24.874
I went to his room and there's
someone in there with him.

01:25:25.082 --> 01:25:28.586
- Did you knock on the door?
- Yes, but I don't know what she'll do.

01:25:28.878 --> 01:25:32.631
They're making a lot of noise.
They're having sex.

01:25:32.882 --> 01:25:35.009
I know it's Sil, I know it!

01:25:35.634 --> 01:25:36.635
Okay.

01:25:37.052 --> 01:25:39.054
I believe you. I'll get dressed.

01:25:55.155 --> 01:25:56.948
I enjoyed that immensely.

01:26:15.509 --> 01:26:18.094
- I felt it.
- What?

01:26:21.681 --> 01:26:22.933
It's started.

01:26:23.975 --> 01:26:25.560
What's started?

01:26:25.769 --> 01:26:26.770
Life.

01:26:28.104 --> 01:26:30.106
Oh, my darling girl.

01:26:30.690 --> 01:26:34.820
In some cultures, women believe
they know the moment of conception...

01:26:35.070 --> 01:26:36.696
Don't you believe me? Feel.

01:26:42.244 --> 01:26:43.787
Holy shit!

01:26:49.752 --> 01:26:51.712
I hope you're right about this, Dan.

01:27:04.100 --> 01:27:06.477
- She's headed for the basement.
- We'll take the stairs.

01:27:06.686 --> 01:27:08.062
Laura, come with me!

01:27:08.312 --> 01:27:09.480
Come on!

01:27:12.483 --> 01:27:16.612
If she's pregnant, we gotta
get to her before she gives birth.

01:27:16.821 --> 01:27:19.699
God. We don't know what
we're dealing with here.

01:27:19.907 --> 01:27:23.744
She could have a dozen babies.
She could lay 1000 eggs!

01:27:23.953 --> 01:27:27.248
Oh, God. Did you see Arden?

01:27:27.498 --> 01:27:29.167
Yeah, I did, that poor bastard.

01:27:29.375 --> 01:27:33.963
We can trap her. The fire door opens
from the inside at the bottom exit.

01:27:34.213 --> 01:27:35.214
Then what?

01:27:37.717 --> 01:27:38.926
Holy shit.

01:27:39.135 --> 01:27:42.221
- Oh, my God.
- The bitch went through a steel door!

01:27:42.597 --> 01:27:45.349
Fitch! Dan! We're in the garage!
She got past us!

01:27:56.778 --> 01:27:59.281
- You saw her?
- She was gone before we got here.

01:27:59.490 --> 01:28:01.158
- Here.
- You saw her!

01:28:01.408 --> 01:28:03.368
- Look at the door!
- Which way did she go?

01:28:03.619 --> 01:28:05.954
- Where's Press?
- He took off down that tunnel.

01:28:21.011 --> 01:28:23.972
She kills if she feels threatened.

01:28:24.181 --> 01:28:26.308
She kills if she feels threatened.

01:28:48.665 --> 01:28:50.583
She must've come through here.

01:29:13.106 --> 01:29:15.108
She went down here.
There's no other way.

01:29:15.316 --> 01:29:16.734
Yeah, she's down there.

01:29:18.027 --> 01:29:19.237
Let's go.

01:29:19.779 --> 01:29:22.073
Stand back, I'll clear it out.

01:30:15.336 --> 01:30:17.463
Which way did she go, Dan?

01:30:18.756 --> 01:30:20.633
- I don't know.
- What?

01:30:20.925 --> 01:30:22.843
I'm not sure. She's here.

01:30:23.093 --> 01:30:27.973
Think. You're supposed to have some
extrasensory power! Which way?

01:30:28.808 --> 01:30:33.020
- Which way did she go, Dan?
- I don't know! I don't know!

01:30:36.232 --> 01:30:39.026
- I think she went that way.
- That's good enough for me.

01:30:39.235 --> 01:30:41.028
You think she went that way?

01:30:42.364 --> 01:30:45.033
You don't fucking know, don't you?
You don't fucking know.

01:30:45.242 --> 01:30:47.619
I'll go this way. You come with me.

01:30:47.869 --> 01:30:49.955
- Come with me, Dan!
- Fitch.

01:30:51.748 --> 01:30:53.458
I think she went this way.

01:31:11.351 --> 01:31:12.686
Dan?

01:31:16.273 --> 01:31:17.566
Dan?

01:31:54.854 --> 01:31:56.063
Fitch. Fitch.

01:31:57.648 --> 01:31:59.025
Dan?

01:32:01.694 --> 01:32:03.029
What happened?

01:32:12.330 --> 01:32:13.623
I can feel her.

01:32:14.332 --> 01:32:15.625
She's that way.

01:32:16.417 --> 01:32:17.960
She's that way.

01:32:22.006 --> 01:32:24.634
I never thought
I'd want to kill something.

01:32:25.051 --> 01:32:26.677
Never thought I'd want to.

01:33:02.130 --> 01:33:05.092
It's this way. It's back here.

01:33:36.290 --> 01:33:38.459
Hey, she went in here.

01:33:43.756 --> 01:33:46.134
This must have opened up
during the earthquake.

01:33:47.510 --> 01:33:49.220
Okay, stand back.

01:35:05.297 --> 01:35:06.465
Is that oil?

01:35:06.799 --> 01:35:08.092
Looks like it.

01:35:15.808 --> 01:35:18.978
I'm going back there to see
if I can flush her out.

01:35:19.186 --> 01:35:21.981
If she comes back through here,
let her have it.

01:35:37.289 --> 01:35:39.166
Dan. Dan!

01:36:38.935 --> 01:36:42.063
- Dan, what is it?
- I don't know.

01:36:42.271 --> 01:36:43.564
I don't know.

01:37:44.334 --> 01:37:45.586
Dan.

01:38:07.107 --> 01:38:08.650
Okay.

01:38:10.611 --> 01:38:11.862
It's okay.

01:38:13.530 --> 01:38:14.781
Nobody's gonna hurt you.

01:38:15.657 --> 01:38:16.867
You come here.

01:38:19.203 --> 01:38:21.163
Come on. I got you.

01:38:26.251 --> 01:38:28.545
Press, something's happened
to Dan!

01:38:29.588 --> 01:38:31.007
You okay?

01:38:33.968 --> 01:38:35.261
Shit!

01:38:37.430 --> 01:38:38.890
Dan?

01:38:39.933 --> 01:38:41.559
Dan?

01:38:42.435 --> 01:38:43.728
I'm stuck!

01:38:48.817 --> 01:38:51.361
I need your help! I'm stuck!

01:39:20.431 --> 01:39:22.392
Dan, you gotta hang on!

01:39:29.733 --> 01:39:31.318
Press!

01:39:35.489 --> 01:39:36.699
Dan, keep on.

01:39:50.880 --> 01:39:53.424
Press!

01:40:43.350 --> 01:40:44.601
Hang on, Dan!

01:40:46.978 --> 01:40:48.146
Hang on!

01:40:49.397 --> 01:40:50.398
I got you.

01:40:52.317 --> 01:40:54.277
I got you, Dan. Hang on.

01:40:55.028 --> 01:40:56.363
Shit.

01:41:03.995 --> 01:41:05.455
Hang on!

01:41:07.541 --> 01:41:08.667
Hang on, Dan!

01:41:13.004 --> 01:41:14.881
Get rid of her, Press!

01:41:19.427 --> 01:41:20.595
Duck your head.

01:41:22.222 --> 01:41:24.474
Let go, you motherfucker.

01:41:27.103 --> 01:41:29.730
- I got you. Hold on, I got you.
- Shit.

01:41:35.403 --> 01:41:36.988
I thought I was dead.

01:41:40.533 --> 01:41:43.703
I thought you'd drank your
last Long Island Ice Tea.

01:41:43.911 --> 01:41:45.246
Yeah, I thought we all had.

01:41:47.665 --> 01:41:49.834
Hey, you okay?

01:41:50.376 --> 01:41:51.586
Yeah, I'm okay.

01:41:52.795 --> 01:41:54.672
My pants are a little messed up.

01:41:55.298 --> 01:41:56.591
But I'm okay.

01:41:59.051 --> 01:42:01.512

the predatory half.

01:42:05.892 --> 01:42:07.435
The dead half.

01:42:07.810 --> 01:42:09.270
Let's get the hell out of here.

01:42:53.816 --> 01:42:57.152
I never thought I'd be so happy
to be back in a sewer.
