10:10.410 --> 10:12.012
ABOUT LOOKING FOR A KID

20:03.870 --> 20:05.938
- AND WE THINK
IT'S BECAUSE HE'S GOT TWO MOMS.

20:05.972 --> 20:07.974
- SO NOW YOU WANT
TO PASS HIM OFF

20:08.007 --> 20:10.643
AS THE PRODUCT
OF A HAPPY HETERO HOME LIFE?

20:10.677 --> 20:12.712
FUCK THAT SHIT.

20:12.745 --> 20:14.647
- I TOLD YOU,
HE'S A TOTAL HETEROPHOBE.

20:14.681 --> 20:16.983
- THAT'S TRUE, HE IS.
- IT'S TRUE, I AM.

20:17.016 --> 20:18.818
- BRIAN,
YOU KNOW I WOULD NEVER

20:18.851 --> 20:20.287
ASK YOU TO COMPROMISE
YOUR VALUES.

20:20.320 --> 20:21.288
- SUCH AS THEY ARE.

20:21.321 --> 20:22.154
- BUT YOU'VE ALWAYS SAID,

20:22.188 --> 20:25.692
"IT'S NOT LYING
IF THEY MAKE YOU LIE."

20:25.725 --> 20:26.693
YOU WANT GUS TO HAVE

20:26.726 --> 20:27.660
THE SAME ADVANTAGES AS KIDS

20:27.694 --> 20:30.630
WHO HAVE GOT A MOMMY
AND A DADDY, DON'T YOU?

20:30.663 --> 20:31.864
YOU WANT HIM TO GO
TO THE BEST SCHOOLS,

20:31.898 --> 20:34.701
RECEIVE THE BEST EDUCATION,
THEN YOU'VE TO HELP US MAKE SURE

20:34.734 --> 20:38.271
THAT DESPITE WHAT OTHER PEOPLE
MIGHT THINK OF US,

20:38.305 --> 20:40.640
HE'S NOT THE ONE
WHO SUFFERS.

20:40.673 --> 20:42.809
SO WE FOUND ANOTHER SCHOOL,

20:42.842 --> 20:47.046
AND WE HAVE
AN APPOINTMENT TOMORROW.

20:47.079 --> 20:51.384
- HOW LONG DID THEY GO OUT FOR?
- I-I CAN'T REMEMBER.

20:51.418 --> 20:53.753
- WAS IT SERIOUS?
- HOW DO I KNOW?

20:53.786 --> 20:56.656
- DID SHE LOVE HIM?
- SHE DIDN'T SAY.

20:56.689 --> 20:58.891
- DIDN'T SAY?
THERE'S NOTHING MOM DOESN'T SAY.

20:58.925 --> 21:01.628
- LOOK, MICHAEL,
IT WAS A LONG TIME AGO.

21:01.661 --> 21:03.730
WHY DON'T YOU ASK HER?

21:03.763 --> 21:05.498
- ASK ME WHAT?

21:05.532 --> 21:07.033
- ABOUT DANNY DEVORE.

21:07.066 --> 21:09.869
- CHRIST.

21:09.902 --> 21:12.905
I HAVEN'T HEARD HIS NAME
MENTIONED IN 30 YEARS,

21:12.939 --> 21:15.542
AND NOW, ALL OF A SUDDEN,
IT'S ALL I HEAR.

21:15.575 --> 21:17.644
- I SAW HIS PICTURE
IN YOUR YEARBOOK.

21:17.677 --> 21:19.979
- WHO THE HELL TOLD YOU YOU
COULD BE LOOKING IN MY YEARBOOK?

21:20.012 --> 21:21.814
- YOU NEVER SAID
I COULDN'T.

21:21.848 --> 21:23.516
IT'S JUST THAT
THIS PICTURE OF HIM--

21:23.550 --> 21:24.951
IT LOOKS A LOT LIKE ME.

21:24.984 --> 21:26.319
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

21:26.353 --> 21:28.020
IT DOESN'T LOOK
THE LEAST BIT LIKE YOU.

21:28.054 --> 21:31.791
- YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE
YOUR READING GLASSES ON.

21:31.824 --> 21:32.659
- FINE.

21:32.692 --> 21:36.663
MAKE ME FEEL OLDER
THAN I ALREADY DO.

21:36.696 --> 21:40.066
THERE.

21:40.099 --> 21:43.736
I STILL DON'T SEE IT.
VIC, DO YOU SEE IT?

21:43.770 --> 21:47.039
- CAN'T SAY I DO.
- AW, COME ON.

21:47.073 --> 21:49.609
WE HAVE THE SAME EYES,
THE SAME NOSE, THE SAME MOUTH.

21:49.642 --> 21:51.411
TELL ME
THAT'S NOT MY CHIN.

21:51.444 --> 21:52.512
- NOT EVEN CLOSE.

21:52.545 --> 21:55.748
AND TRUST ME, I KNOW CHINS.
I HAVE SEVERAL OF THEM.

21:55.782 --> 21:59.686
- MA, I JUST WANT YOU
TO TELL ME.

21:59.719 --> 22:01.020
- TELL YOU WHAT?

22:01.053 --> 22:03.723
- WHY DANNY DEVORE AND I
LOOK SO MUCH ALIKE.

22:03.756 --> 22:05.625
- I'VE GOT TO PUT THE CLOTHES
IN THE DRYER.

22:05.658 --> 22:06.859
- STAY RIGHT THERE.

22:06.893 --> 22:09.095
WHAT ARE YOU GETTING AT?

22:09.128 --> 22:11.431
- HE SAID THAT YOU WENT OUT
SUMMER AFTER GRADUATION.

22:11.464 --> 22:12.665
THAT WAS 1969.

22:12.699 --> 22:14.867
I WAS BORN MARCH 1970.

22:14.901 --> 22:17.670
- [laughs]

22:17.704 --> 22:20.440
I DON'T BELIEVE
WHAT I'M HEARING.

22:20.473 --> 22:23.843
ARE YOU ASKING ME
I-IF SOME OLD DRAG QUEEN

22:23.876 --> 22:28.448
THAT I ONCE KNEW
IN HIGH SCHOOL IS YOUR FATHER?

22:28.481 --> 22:30.383
YOU KNOW
WHO YOUR FATHER IS.

22:30.417 --> 22:32.652
THIS IS YOUR FATHER.

22:32.685 --> 22:36.022
JOHN MICHAEL NOVOTNY.

22:36.055 --> 22:37.624
LIEUTENANT
IN THE U.S. ARMY.

22:37.657 --> 22:41.994
both: DIED IN VIETNAM, APRIL 10,
1970, TWO WEEKS AFTER--

22:42.028 --> 22:44.130
- YOU WERE BORN.
- I WAS BORN. I KNOW.

22:44.163 --> 22:46.132
YOU TOLD ME
A MILLION TIMES

22:46.165 --> 22:47.667
THAT THIS GUY
IN THIS PICTURE,

22:47.700 --> 22:49.969
WHO DOESN'T EVEN
LOOK LIKE ME, IS MY DAD.

22:50.002 --> 22:51.738
BUT THAT'S ALL
YOU'VE TOLD ME.

22:51.771 --> 22:53.840
- WELL, WHAT ELSE
DO YOU WANT TO KNOW?

22:53.873 --> 22:55.475
- WELL,
WHO ARE MY GRANDPARENTS?

22:55.508 --> 22:57.877
- THEY'RE DEAD.
- AUNTS AND UNCLES?

22:57.910 --> 22:59.011
- THERE WEREN'T ANY.

22:59.045 --> 23:00.747
- SO HE WAS JUST A WAR HERO?

23:00.780 --> 23:02.715
- "JUST"?

23:02.749 --> 23:06.018
THEY AWARDED HIM
THE PURPLE HEART.

23:06.052 --> 23:07.620
HE WAS ON A RESCUE MISSION,

23:07.654 --> 23:09.155
CARVING HIS WAY
THROUGH THE JUNGLE

23:09.188 --> 23:10.923
WHEN A LAND MINE EXPLODED.

23:10.957 --> 23:12.825
- YOU SAID IT WAS
A JEEP ACCIDENT.

23:12.859 --> 23:16.062
- HE WAS CARVING HIS WAY
IN A JEEP...

23:16.095 --> 23:18.030
WHEN IT RAN OVER
A LAND MINE.

23:18.064 --> 23:20.032
- YOU CAN'T EVEN KEEP
THE GODDAMN STORY STRAIGHT.

23:20.066 --> 23:21.634
- STOP CONFUSING ME!

23:21.668 --> 23:24.203
- LOOK, IT WAS A LONG TIME AGO.
IT DOESN'T MATTER NOW.

23:24.236 --> 23:26.773
- I JUST WANT
TO KNOW THE TRUTH.

23:26.806 --> 23:29.141
- ARE YOU CALLING ME A LIAR?

23:29.175 --> 23:31.578
YOUR OWN MOTHER?

23:31.611 --> 23:35.582
I TOLD YOU WHO YOUR FATHER WAS,
AND I EXPECT YOU TO BELIEVE ME.

23:50.597 --> 23:53.199
- GONNA GO SEE GRANDMA.

23:53.232 --> 23:54.734
- JUST PROMISE ME
YOU'LL BEHAVE.

23:54.767 --> 23:57.937
- I WON'T MENTION DICK
IF YOU DON'T MENTION PUSSY.

23:57.970 --> 23:59.071
- YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

23:59.105 --> 24:00.072
I DON'T WANT YOU GETTING
INTO ONE OF YOUR MOODS AND...

24:00.106 --> 24:02.208
- HEY, I WANT THE HOMO HATERS
TO LIKE OUR KID

24:02.241 --> 24:04.611
JUST AS MUCH AS YOU DO.

24:04.644 --> 24:06.012
- YOU LOOK VERY HANDSOME
IN THAT SUIT.

24:06.045 --> 24:08.548
- WELL,
I TOOK A BATH AND EVERYTHING.

24:08.581 --> 24:11.718
- THIS IS IT.
DON'T BE NERVOUS.

24:11.751 --> 24:14.887
- IF MY HEART RATE
WAS ANY LOWER, I'D BE DEAD.

24:17.990 --> 24:22.662
- OOH.

24:22.695 --> 24:24.697
HI.

24:24.731 --> 24:26.933
- OH, HELLO.
- HELLO, WE'RE THE, UH...

24:26.966 --> 24:29.502
- THE KINNEYS?
- WHO?

24:29.536 --> 24:33.239
- UH, UH, MR. AND MRS. KINNEY?
- RIGHT!

24:33.272 --> 24:35.508
- SOMETIMES SHE FORGETS.
DON'T YOU, HONEY?

24:35.542 --> 24:37.810
- I DIDN'T FORGET.
HE'S SUCH A KIDDER.

24:37.844 --> 24:39.278
- OH, OH, PLEASE.

24:39.311 --> 24:42.481
I'LL TELL MS. HARPER
YOU'RE HERE.

24:46.953 --> 24:48.287
- [clears throat]

24:48.320 --> 24:50.489
- MAIN OFFICE.

24:55.227 --> 24:57.930
- I TOLD YOU TO BEHAVE.
GEE.

24:57.964 --> 25:01.000
- WELL, YOU COULD SEND ME
TO THE PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE,

25:01.033 --> 25:02.969
BUT I'M ALREADY HERE.

25:03.002 --> 25:04.270
- THIS IS ALL SO STRANGE.

25:04.303 --> 25:06.806
I MEAN, I ALWAYS KNEW
ONE DAY I'D HAVE A CHILD

25:06.839 --> 25:09.742
LIKE GUS AND HE'D GO
TO A SCHOOL LIKE THIS ONE.

25:09.776 --> 25:12.545
BUT I NEVER IMAGINED IT
TO BE LIKE THIS.

25:12.579 --> 25:15.247
- WELL,
THERE'S NO PREDICTING.

25:15.281 --> 25:18.951
OOPS, I SAID "DICK,"
DIDN'T I?

25:18.985 --> 25:22.622
- CAN'T YOU BE SERIOUS,
FOR EVEN A MINUTE?

25:22.655 --> 25:24.824
- [sighs]

25:24.857 --> 25:29.762
YOU'RE ON.
- [scoffs]

25:29.796 --> 25:32.164
IN FACT,
THERE WAS EVEN A TIME...

25:32.198 --> 25:35.134
WHEN WE FIRST MET...

25:35.167 --> 25:40.172
THAT I THOUGHT
THIS COULD'VE BEEN THE REALITY.

25:40.206 --> 25:43.843
DID YOU EVER FEEL THAT WAY?

25:43.876 --> 25:47.079
- NO.

25:47.113 --> 25:51.017
WELL, YOU WANTED ME
TO BE SERIOUS, I...

25:52.985 --> 25:56.856
THAT DOESN'T MEAN
I DON'T LOVE YOU.

25:57.924 --> 25:59.025
- MR. AND MRS. KINNEY?

25:59.058 --> 26:02.629
- OH. MINUTE'S UP.
- OH. YEAH.

26:02.662 --> 26:04.330
- OH, PLEASE,
DON'T BE EMBARRASSED.

26:04.363 --> 26:08.067
IT'S ALWAYS NICE TO SEE YOUNG
PARENTS EXPRESSING AFFECTION.

26:08.100 --> 26:09.235
AND I THINK
IT'S IMPORTANT FOR CHILDREN

26:09.268 --> 26:12.238
TO SEE THAT TOO,
DON'T YOU AGREE?

26:12.271 --> 26:13.673
COME INTO MY OFFICE, PLEASE,

26:13.706 --> 26:18.645
AND WE'LL DISCUSS
GUS'S FUTURE.

26:21.047 --> 26:24.651
- I'D NEVER, IN A MILLION YEARS,
KNOW IT WAS YOU.

26:24.684 --> 26:27.887
- 30 YEARS IS A LONG TIME.

26:27.920 --> 26:29.956
- TRY 31.
[chuckles]

26:29.989 --> 26:30.957
BUT WHO'S COUNTING?

26:30.990 --> 26:35.361
- SO COME ON IN.

26:35.394 --> 26:36.696
CAN I FIX YOU A DRINK?

26:36.729 --> 26:40.667
- [giggles]
NO. NO, THANKS.

26:44.771 --> 26:46.639
GOD, YOU GOT
MORE SHIT THAN I DO.

26:46.673 --> 26:49.942
- THESE DAYS, IT TAKES A LITTLE
LONGER TO LOOK FABULOUS.

26:49.976 --> 26:53.780
- [chuckles]
TELL ME ABOUT IT.

26:53.813 --> 26:55.347
IS THIS REAL?

26:55.381 --> 26:59.285
- HONEY, I WISH.

26:59.318 --> 27:03.790
SO HOW ARE YOU DOING,
MY DIVINA?

27:03.823 --> 27:07.093
[both laugh]

27:07.126 --> 27:09.996
- THAT'S WHAT YOU CALLED ME
IN HIGH SCHOOL.

27:10.029 --> 27:11.798
- NOW, YOUR SON TELLS ME
YOU WORK AT THE DINER,

27:11.831 --> 27:13.232
AND VIC WAS SICK
AND NOW HE'S BETTER.

27:13.265 --> 27:15.935
- 30 YEARS IN A NUTSHELL.

27:15.968 --> 27:18.705
- 31.
- YEAH.

27:18.738 --> 27:21.440
- MICHAEL...

27:21.473 --> 27:25.211
IS A VERY NICE YOUNG MAN.

27:25.244 --> 27:26.345
- I'M VERY PROUD OF HIM.

27:26.378 --> 27:28.414
- AND I WOULD BE TOO.

27:28.447 --> 27:33.152
HE'S POLITE, CARING,
GOOD-LOOKING.

27:33.185 --> 27:38.224
IN FACT, HE REMINDED ME A LOT
OF SOMEONE I USED TO KNOW.

27:38.257 --> 27:40.026
ONLY AT FIRST, I COULDN'T
FIGURE OUT WHO IT WAS.

27:40.059 --> 27:42.428
THEN WHEN I DISCOVERED
THAT YOU WERE HIS MOTHER,

27:42.461 --> 27:43.429
I REALIZED

27:43.462 --> 27:46.465
I WAS LOOKING AT MYSELF.

27:46.498 --> 27:48.768
IN A MIRROR,
THROUGH TIME.

27:48.801 --> 27:52.772
WHY DIDN'T YOU
EVER TELL ME?

27:52.805 --> 27:57.043
- YOU'D ALREADY LEFT TOWN.

27:57.076 --> 28:01.313
RUN OFF TO THE BIG CITY
TO BE A STAR.

28:01.347 --> 28:03.282
W-WHAT WAS I SUPPOSED TO DO?

28:03.315 --> 28:04.817
CALL YOU UP AND SAY, "HEY!

28:04.851 --> 28:07.754
"GUESS WHAT,
YOU'RE A DAD.

28:07.787 --> 28:11.357
COME BACK AND MARRY ME."

28:13.826 --> 28:16.328
- SO YOU DECIDED
TO HAVE HIM ON YOUR OWN,

28:16.362 --> 28:19.766
RAISE HIM ON YOUR OWN.

28:19.799 --> 28:24.036
MUST HAVE TAKEN
A LOT OF COURAGE.

28:24.070 --> 28:27.473
- IT WAS THE EASIEST DECISION
I EVER MADE.

28:27.506 --> 28:32.478
- WHO'D YOU TELL HIM
HIS FATHER WAS?

28:32.511 --> 28:36.482
- A SOLDIER
WHO'D DIED IN VIETNAM.

28:36.515 --> 28:39.185
I PICKED HIS NAME
OUT OF THE NEWSPAPER.

28:39.218 --> 28:43.455
FROM THE LIST OF THE DEAD.

28:43.489 --> 28:45.958
I EVEN CHANGED
MY OWN NAME.

28:45.992 --> 28:47.459
- HMM.

28:47.493 --> 28:50.296
YOU WENT TO A LOT OF TROUBLE TO
MAKE SURE HE'D NEVER FIND OUT.

28:50.329 --> 28:52.965
- I WANTED HIM
TO HAVE A HERO.

28:52.999 --> 28:55.935
- AND I COULD NEVER BE THAT.

28:58.905 --> 29:03.375
- IT WASN'T SO MUCH
THAT YOU WERE GAY, DANNY.

29:03.409 --> 29:05.344
I ALWAYS
KIND OF SUSPECTED.

29:05.377 --> 29:10.382
IN FACT, THAT'S PROBABLY
WHY I LIKED YOU.

29:10.416 --> 29:12.284
IT'S THAT YOU LIED TO ME.

29:12.318 --> 29:15.554
- YOU WEREN'T
THE ONLY ONE.

29:15.587 --> 29:18.925
I LIED TO MYSELF AS WELL.

29:18.958 --> 29:21.127
I WANTED TO BE
SOMETHING I WASN'T.

29:21.160 --> 29:25.331
- WELL, YOU SURE AS HELL
SUCCEEDED.

29:25.364 --> 29:27.099
AND HE SURE AS HELL
DIDN'T NEED TO KNOW

29:27.133 --> 29:31.303
THAT HIS DAD
WAS A DRAG QUEEN.

29:31.337 --> 29:33.472
AND NOW HE'S FOUND YOUR GODDAMN
PICTURE IN THE YEARBOOK.

29:33.505 --> 29:37.343
AND HE'S PUT
TWO AND TWO TOGETHER.

29:39.111 --> 29:40.246
AND KNOWING HIM,

29:40.279 --> 29:41.247
HE'S COMING HERE
TO TALK TO YOU ANY MINUTE.

29:41.280 --> 29:43.950
- CHRIST, WHAT DO I TELL HIM?

29:43.983 --> 29:45.952
- HELL IF I KNOW.

29:45.985 --> 29:48.087
- WELL, I'M SURE IF YOU
EXPLAINED IT, HE'D UNDERSTAND.

29:48.120 --> 29:50.923
- WHAT, THAT I'VE LIED TO HIM
HIS ENTIRE LIFE?

29:55.061 --> 29:57.363
HE'LL NEVER TRUST ME AGAIN.

29:57.396 --> 29:59.398
AND I WOULDN'T BLAME HIM.

30:06.005 --> 30:09.041
- WE WERE WITH HER
ALMOST 2 1/2 HOURS.

30:09.075 --> 30:11.177
SHE SEEMED
REALLY IMPRESSED.

30:11.210 --> 30:12.979
- WELL, THAT'S A GOOD SIGN,
ISN'T IT?

30:13.012 --> 30:15.481
- I HOPE SO.

30:21.320 --> 30:22.454
AH.

30:22.488 --> 30:24.924
CHRIST, I HATE THESE HEELS.

30:24.957 --> 30:28.560
[groans]
- BABY, COME HERE.

30:28.594 --> 30:30.963
- [sighs]

30:30.997 --> 30:33.165
THAT'S NICE.

30:33.199 --> 30:35.567
- AND BRIAN BEHAVED HIMSELF?

30:35.601 --> 30:39.238
- MORE THAN BEHAVED.
HE WAS CHARMING AND ATTENTIVE.

30:39.271 --> 30:41.207
- I HOPE
NOT TOO ATTENTIVE.

30:41.240 --> 30:45.644
- HE COMPLIMENTED THE SCHOOL
UP THE WAZOO.

30:45.677 --> 30:48.614
EVERYTHING WAS PERFECT.

30:48.647 --> 30:50.549
- SO WHY SUDDENLY
THE LONG FACE?

30:50.582 --> 30:52.651
- IT SHOULD'VE BEEN
YOU AND ME IN THERE.

30:52.684 --> 30:54.620
- YEAH.

30:54.653 --> 30:57.556
WHATEVER IT TAKES.

30:57.589 --> 31:00.459
BESIDES, IT WAS YOUR IDEA.
- I KNOW.

31:00.492 --> 31:04.263
[chuckles] IT SEEMED LIKE
A GOOD ONE AT THE TIME, BUT...

31:04.296 --> 31:06.065
NOW, I DON'T KNOW.

31:06.098 --> 31:09.368
- HEY, DON'T WORRY
ABOUT IT.

31:09.401 --> 31:12.238
SOMETIMES THE ENDS
ACTUALLY DO JUSTIFY THE MEANS.

31:12.271 --> 31:13.605
[phone rings]

31:13.639 --> 31:15.307
BESIDES,
THE IMPORTANT THING IS

31:15.341 --> 31:17.543
IS THAT GUS HAS THE SAME CHANCE
AS EVERY OTHER KID.

31:17.576 --> 31:21.647
[phone rings]

31:21.680 --> 31:23.115
Y'ELLO?

31:23.149 --> 31:24.250
- MAY I SPEAK
WITH MRS. KINNEY?

31:24.283 --> 31:26.118
- WHO?
- MRS. KINNEY.

31:26.152 --> 31:29.688
- AH--OH.
YES, HANG ON.

31:29.721 --> 31:33.392
MRS. KINNEY.

31:33.425 --> 31:36.362
- HELLO?
MS. HARPER.

31:36.395 --> 31:39.531
- I JUDGE YOU'RE WELL?
- YES, THANK YOU.

31:39.565 --> 31:41.167
OH, MEL AND I--
I MEAN...

31:41.200 --> 31:43.435
BRIAN AND I
FELT THE SAME WAY.

31:43.469 --> 31:46.038
WE WOULD BE SO PLEASED
IF GUS WAS ENROLLED IN...

31:46.072 --> 31:48.707
WHAT?

31:48.740 --> 31:50.909
UH-HUH.

31:54.613 --> 31:55.581
UH-HUH.

31:55.614 --> 31:58.350
- "UH-HUH," WHAT?

31:58.384 --> 32:01.020
- I UNDERSTAND.

32:01.053 --> 32:02.488
WELL, UH...

32:02.521 --> 32:06.358
THANK YOU FOR CALLING.

32:06.392 --> 32:07.493
[beep]

32:07.526 --> 32:09.028
- WHAT?
WHAT'D SHE SAY?

32:09.061 --> 32:11.163
- HE DIDN'T GET IN.

32:11.197 --> 32:14.133
- WHAT?

32:14.166 --> 32:15.301
- HE DIDN'T GET IN.

32:15.334 --> 32:17.203
OH, GOD.

32:17.236 --> 32:18.704
MS. HARPER CALLED
WITH HER APOLOGIES.

32:18.737 --> 32:20.706
SHE THOUGHT MY HUSBAND AND I
WERE ABSOLUTELY CHARMING,

32:20.739 --> 32:22.441
AND THEY WOULD LOVE
TO HAVE GUS, BUT...

32:22.474 --> 32:23.542
- SO WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

32:23.575 --> 32:26.212
- THEY ONLY HAD
ONE SPOT OPEN,

32:26.245 --> 32:29.448
AND THEY GAVE IT
TO ANOTHER CHILD...

32:29.481 --> 32:33.052
WITH SAME-SEX PARENTS.

32:33.085 --> 32:37.489
- ARE YOU SHITTING ME?

32:37.523 --> 32:38.690
- THE BOARD DECIDED

32:38.724 --> 32:41.727
THAT THE STUDENT POPULATION
HAD TO BE MORE DIVERSIFIED.

32:41.760 --> 32:44.296
- WELL, WE'RE GOING TO SUE.
TH-THIS IS DISCRIMINATION.

32:44.330 --> 32:48.200
- [laughs] AGAINST WHO?
HETEROSEXUALS?

32:48.234 --> 32:51.003
[laughing]

32:54.173 --> 32:55.674
- YOU THINK
THIS IS FUNNY?

32:55.707 --> 32:59.145
- I THINK IT'S HILARIOUS!

32:59.178 --> 33:02.181
OH, WAIT TILL BRIAN HEARS.

33:02.214 --> 33:04.216
- WHAT ARE WE
GOING TO DO NOW?

33:04.250 --> 33:07.753
- I'M GOING
TO TAKE A BATH.

33:07.786 --> 33:09.421
AND FIRST THING TOMORROW,

33:09.455 --> 33:13.159
WE'RE GOING TO LOOK
FOR ANOTHER SCHOOL.

33:13.192 --> 33:16.028
AND THIS TIME,
GUS'S PARENTS,

33:16.062 --> 33:19.431
LINDSAY AND MELANIE,
WILL GO TO THE INTERVIEW.

33:24.336 --> 33:26.738
COME ON,
RUB MY OTHER FOOT.

33:26.772 --> 33:29.108
- I'LL RUB YOUR OTHER FOOT.

33:29.141 --> 33:31.310
I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT I'M GOING TO RUB.

33:31.343 --> 33:33.779
OH!
[shrieks]

33:33.812 --> 33:37.749
- * I WON'T DRESS
LIKE THE MAGAZINES *

33:37.783 --> 33:41.387
* OR COPY
PAINT-BY-NUMBER DREAMS *

33:41.420 --> 33:44.823
* SAFE IN THE MIDDLE,
BETWEEN EXTREMES *

33:44.856 --> 33:49.061
* YOU GO AHEAD
BUT IT'S NOT FOR ME *

33:49.095 --> 33:53.199
* WHEN I WAS BORN
THEY BROKE THE MOLD *

33:53.232 --> 33:56.335
* I WON'T LISTEN,
I DON'T WANNA BE TOLD *

33:56.368 --> 34:00.339
* TO FOLLOW
EVERY TREND I SEE *

34:00.372 --> 34:01.340
* YOU GO AHEAD

34:01.373 --> 34:02.641
- WHEN I WAS IN SCHOOL,

34:02.674 --> 34:05.811
I HAD A PART-TIME JOB
WALKING PEOPLE'S DOGS.

34:05.844 --> 34:08.114
WHO KNEW YOU COULD
MAKE MONEY WAGGING YOUR TAIL?

34:08.147 --> 34:11.350
- * I HAD TO LEARN
TO STAND MY GROUND *

34:11.383 --> 34:13.852
* COULDN'T RELY
ON NO ONE ELSE *

34:13.885 --> 34:16.088
* TO DO
A JOB DONE RIGHT *

34:16.122 --> 34:19.425
* YOU GOTTA DO IT YOURSELF

34:19.458 --> 34:20.826
* I GREW UP
AND I MADE MY WAY *

34:20.859 --> 34:22.294
- SOME TURNOUT, HUH?

34:22.328 --> 34:24.796
- CONGRATULATIONS, BABY.
- THANK YOU.

34:24.830 --> 34:28.300
BUT I OWE IT ALL TO MICHAEL
FOR DELIVERING DIVINA.

34:28.334 --> 34:29.635
- HERE YOU GO.
- THANKS.

34:29.668 --> 34:33.172
OH, SHOW'S ABOUT TO START.
- OOH.

34:33.205 --> 34:34.440
- SEE YA.

34:34.473 --> 34:36.208
- * I WON'T DRESS
LIKE THE MAGAZINES *

34:36.242 --> 34:37.309
- AREN'T YOU GOING TO STAY?

34:37.343 --> 34:39.478
- * OR COPY
PAINT-BY-NUMBER DREAMS *

34:39.511 --> 34:40.379
- HEY,
AREN'T YOU STICKING AROUND?

34:40.412 --> 34:41.580
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
HIS NUMBER ONE FAN.

34:41.613 --> 34:44.150
- JUST LEAVE ME ALONE.

34:44.183 --> 34:46.552
HOW CAN SOMEBODY PUT ON AN ACT
LIKE THAT ALL THESE YEARS?

34:46.585 --> 34:48.287
- YEAH, I'D RATHER
HAVE A HIGH COLONIC

34:48.320 --> 34:50.422
THAN HEAR SOME OLD QUEEN
DO ROSE'S TURN.

34:50.456 --> 34:52.258
- I MEAN MY MOTHER.

34:52.291 --> 34:54.226
- * I WON'T LISTEN,
I DON'T WANNA BE TOLD *

34:54.260 --> 34:55.261
- YOU DON'T KNOW FOR SURE.

34:55.294 --> 34:57.463
- THAT MY MOM LIED TO ME?

34:57.496 --> 34:59.631
THAT MY FATHER'S
NOT A WAR HERO, HE'S...

34:59.665 --> 35:02.668
JUDY GARLAND?

35:02.701 --> 35:06.672
- WOULD YOU PREFER
BETTE DAVIS?

35:06.705 --> 35:09.675
- * NOW I KNOW THAT I'M...

35:09.708 --> 35:11.210
- MAYBE I SHOULD
JUST FORGET IT.

35:11.243 --> 35:13.179
- AND NOW,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

35:13.212 --> 35:15.347
LADIES WHO ARE GENTLEMEN,
GENTLEMEN WHO ARE LADIES,

35:15.381 --> 35:16.582
AND ANYONE ELSE
THAT MANAGEMENT

35:16.615 --> 35:19.185
SINCERELY REGRETS
HAVING OMITTED,

35:19.218 --> 35:21.220
THE ANGEL BALL
WELCOMES ITS FAVORITE ANGEL,

35:21.253 --> 35:24.756
PITTSBURGH'S OWN
MISS DIVINA DEVORE.

35:24.790 --> 35:29.595
- * HEAVEN,
I'M IN HEAVEN *

35:29.628 --> 35:31.230
* AND MY HEART BEATS

35:31.263 --> 35:35.201
* SO THAT
I CAN HARDLY SPEAK *

35:35.234 --> 35:37.203
* AND I SEEM TO FIND

35:37.236 --> 35:40.172
* THE HAPPINESS I SEEK
- LOOK UP THERE!

35:40.206 --> 35:45.644
* WHEN WE'RE OUT TOGETHER
DANCING CHEEK TO CHEEK *

35:45.677 --> 35:48.947
*

35:48.980 --> 35:51.783
* OH, HEAVEN

35:51.817 --> 35:54.586
* I'M IN HEAVEN

35:54.620 --> 35:56.788
* AND THE CARES THAT HUNG

35:56.822 --> 35:59.825
* AROUND ME THROUGH A WEEK

35:59.858 --> 36:04.796
* SEEM TO VANISH LIKE
A GAMBLER'S LUCKY STREAK *

36:04.830 --> 36:07.666
* WHEN WE'RE OUT TOGETHER

36:07.699 --> 36:11.403
* SWINGING CHEEK TO CHEEK

36:11.437 --> 36:13.572
OOH, PITTSBURGH.

36:13.605 --> 36:15.507
[cheers and applause]

36:15.541 --> 36:19.945
* DANCE WITH ME
I WANT MY ARM ABOUT YOU *

36:19.978 --> 36:22.814
* THE CHARM ABOUT YOU

36:22.848 --> 36:24.950
* WILL CARRY ME THROUGH

36:24.983 --> 36:29.555
* TO HEAVEN,
I'M IN HEAVEN... *

36:32.324 --> 36:33.859
MICHAEL.

36:33.892 --> 36:35.927
- MAY I COME IN?
- WELL, I...

36:35.961 --> 36:37.963
USUALLY DON'T UNDRESS
IN FRONT OF MEN I BARELY KNOW,

36:37.996 --> 36:41.433
BUT IN YOUR CASE,
I'LL MAKE AN EXCEPTION.

36:41.467 --> 36:42.534
HOW'D IT GO?

36:42.568 --> 36:47.306
DID "ANGELS OVER PITTSBURGH"
MAKE BUCKETS OF BUCKS?

36:47.339 --> 36:48.307
- ENOUGH TO BAIL THEM OUT
FOR A WHILE.

36:48.340 --> 36:49.575
IT WAS GREAT OF YOU
TO HELP.

36:49.608 --> 36:51.410
- WELL, IT'S THE LAST BENEFIT
I'LL EVER DO.

36:51.443 --> 36:52.711
- SOMEHOW I DOUBT THAT.

36:52.744 --> 36:55.981
- [chuckles]
WELL...

36:56.014 --> 36:57.983
YOU TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF,
MICHAEL.

36:58.016 --> 36:59.718
IT WAS NICE TO MEET YOU.

36:59.751 --> 37:01.320
- ACTUALLY,
I HAVE ANOTHER FAVOR.

37:01.353 --> 37:03.989
- OH, FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE,

37:04.022 --> 37:06.558
HAVEN'T WE DONE ENOUGH
FOR HUMANITY?

37:06.592 --> 37:07.859
ANY MORE AND...

37:07.893 --> 37:09.728
AND I'LL BE
IRRITABLE ALL WEEK.

37:09.761 --> 37:11.897
- IT'S NOT CHARITY.

37:11.930 --> 37:14.300
ALTHOUGH YOU'D BE HELPING ME OUT
A LOT IF YOU'D LOOK AT THIS.

37:14.333 --> 37:18.337
IT'S YOUR OLD
HIGH SCHOOL YEARBOOK.

37:18.370 --> 37:21.540
AND THIS IS YOU.

37:24.009 --> 37:26.011
- OH, MY GOD.

37:26.044 --> 37:28.580
I HAVEN'T SEEN THAT IN 30...

37:28.614 --> 37:30.482
MAKE THAT 18 YEARS.

37:30.516 --> 37:32.618
- NOTICE ANY RESEMBLANCE?

37:32.651 --> 37:35.354
- YEAH.
IT'S UNMISTAKABLE.

37:35.387 --> 37:37.889
I LOOK EXACTLY
LIKE TOM CRUISE.

37:37.923 --> 37:41.460
- I MEANT TO ME.

37:41.493 --> 37:44.730
- YOU?
[laughs]

37:44.763 --> 37:46.698
WELL, I APPRECIATE
THE FLATTERY,

37:46.732 --> 37:49.435
BUT FRANKLY, NO.
I DON'T SEE IT.

37:49.468 --> 37:50.636
- HOW CAN YOU MISS IT?

37:50.669 --> 37:53.004
I MEAN, THE WAY YOU LOOKED
BACK THEN, THE WAY I LOOK NOW.

37:53.038 --> 37:55.341
I MEAN, WE'RE PRACTICALLY
IDENTICAL TWINS.

37:55.374 --> 37:58.910
- WELL, I SUPPOSE IF YOU SQUINT,
THERE'S A SLIGHT RESEMBLANCE.

37:58.944 --> 38:00.379
BUT SO WHAT?

38:00.412 --> 38:03.415
HERE, HELP ME
WITH THIS ZIPPER.

38:03.449 --> 38:05.351
I ASKED FOR A DRESSER,

38:05.384 --> 38:06.518
AND THEY'RE
TOO GODDAMN CHEAP...

38:06.552 --> 38:10.389
- ARE YOU MY FATHER?

38:10.422 --> 38:12.358
- THIS IS
A FINE TIME TO ASK.

38:12.391 --> 38:15.394
AS YOU'RE HELPING ME
OUT OF MY GOWN.

38:15.427 --> 38:16.662
- YOU WERE SEEING
MY MOTHER THEN.

38:16.695 --> 38:18.063
THE TIMING IS EXACTLY RIGHT
FOR YOU TO HAVE...

38:18.096 --> 38:19.064
- KNOCKED HER UP?

38:19.097 --> 38:23.802
FIRST, I WOULD'VE
HAD TO HAVE GOTTEN IT UP.

38:23.835 --> 38:26.004
- WHAT, YOU MEAN,
YOU AND SHE NEVER...

38:26.037 --> 38:28.607
- LOOK AT ME.

38:28.640 --> 38:33.645
DO I LOOK LIKE THE KIND OF GUY
WHO GOES AROUND BANGING BABES?

38:33.679 --> 38:36.081
YOUR MOTHER
WAS HARDLY MY TYPE.

38:36.114 --> 38:37.248
- BUT YOU SAID
SHE WAS BEAUTIFUL

38:37.282 --> 38:40.552
AND THAT BACK THEN YOU USED
TO BAT FOR THE OTHER TEAM.

38:40.586 --> 38:41.987
- DRAG QUEENS
ARE NOTORIOUS LIARS.

38:42.020 --> 38:45.357
EVERYONE KNOWS THAT.

38:45.391 --> 38:47.526
SO WHAT DOES
YOUR MOTHER SAY?

38:47.559 --> 38:50.629
- SHE SAYS MY FATHER
IS THIS BIG WAR HERO.

38:50.662 --> 38:52.564
- SO WHY DON'T YOU
BELIEVE THAT?

38:52.598 --> 38:55.867
- BECAUSE THE STORY
KEEPS CHANGING, AND THE--

38:55.901 --> 38:57.002
THERE'S ONLY ONE PICTURE,

38:57.035 --> 38:59.738
AND THE GUY
DOESN'T EVEN LOOK LIKE ME.

38:59.771 --> 39:01.840
LOOK, I'M NOT MAKING
ANY DEMANDS.

39:01.873 --> 39:04.075
I'M NOT EVEN ASKING
THAT WE STAY IN TOUCH.

39:04.109 --> 39:07.679
I JUST WANT TO KNOW
THE TRUTH.

39:10.015 --> 39:13.385
- MICHAEL, MAY I...

39:13.419 --> 39:17.823
TELL YOU THE ONE TRUTH
I'VE LEARNED IN ALL MY YEARS?

39:17.856 --> 39:21.760
THE TRUTH...

39:21.793 --> 39:25.564
IS WHAT YOU CHOOSE
TO BELIEVE.

39:25.597 --> 39:27.999
WHEN I'M ONSTAGE,

39:28.033 --> 39:32.838
PEOPLE BELIEVE
I'M DIVINA DEVORE.

39:32.871 --> 39:35.941
NOT BECAUSE I'M
A GREAT FEMALE IMPERSONATOR,

39:35.974 --> 39:38.710
BUT BECAUSE THEY WANT TO.

39:38.744 --> 39:40.746
- WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO
WITH WHETHER YOU'RE MY FATHER,

39:40.779 --> 39:42.948
OR IF MY MOTHER
LIED TO ME?

39:42.981 --> 39:46.485
- YOUR MOTHER...

39:46.518 --> 39:49.455
GAVE YOU SOMETHING
TO BELIEVE IN.

39:49.488 --> 39:50.989
A HERO.

39:51.022 --> 39:53.625
A FATHER YOU COULD
BE PROUD OF.

39:53.659 --> 39:57.463
BECAUSE SHE LOVES YOU.

39:57.496 --> 40:00.198
THAT'S THE TRUTH.

40:00.231 --> 40:04.836
WHETHER YOU CHOOSE
TO BELIEVE IT OR NOT...

40:04.870 --> 40:07.806
IS UP TO YOU.

40:12.210 --> 40:14.680
- [sighs]

40:19.918 --> 40:25.657
[indistinct chatter]

40:32.831 --> 40:33.865
- STILL HERE?

40:33.899 --> 40:36.067
- SO HOW DID I DO?

40:36.101 --> 40:38.537
- NOT BAD...

40:38.570 --> 40:41.206
FOR YOUR FIRST TIME.

40:43.141 --> 40:45.677
- BUT THE TIPS SUCK.

40:45.711 --> 40:48.480
- WHAT WERE YOU EXPECTING?

40:48.514 --> 40:51.783
- MORE THAN I MAKE
WORKING AT THE DINER.

40:51.817 --> 40:54.620
- WELL, YOU NEED TO DANCE
ON THE BAR.

40:54.653 --> 40:55.487
- HOW DO I DO THAT?

40:55.521 --> 40:57.956
- LOOK, YOU GOTTA
WORK YOUR WAY UP.

40:57.989 --> 40:59.124
MAYBE IN SIX MONTHS.

40:59.157 --> 41:02.728
- SIX MONTHS?

41:02.761 --> 41:04.563
I NEED MONEY NOW
TO PAY FOR SCHOOL.

41:04.596 --> 41:07.165
- THAT IS A PROBLEM.

41:14.205 --> 41:17.509
TELL YOU WHAT.

41:17.543 --> 41:21.780
YOU GIVE ME SOME TIME,
I'LL GIVE YOU SOME TIME.

41:27.619 --> 41:28.854
- NO, THANKS.

41:28.887 --> 41:31.189
- UP TO YOU.

41:31.222 --> 41:32.624
OH, BUT IF YOU
CHANGE YOUR MIND

A PATH THROUGH THE JUNGLE
