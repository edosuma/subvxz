WEBVTT

00:08.581 --> 00:11.215
So the wife says, "Matty's
teacher wants to see us."

00:11.284 --> 00:13.985
I'm like, "My only night off and
I've got to listen to this guy

00:14.052 --> 00:16.321
go off on my kid for not handing
in a second grade book report?"

00:16.389 --> 00:18.356
It's how it starts, man.
He better buckle down

00:18.424 --> 00:20.358
or he's gonna end up
driving a security truck.

00:20.426 --> 00:23.026
(Truck honking)
Nice. Hey, what's this?

00:23.094 --> 00:25.796
I'm gonna give us
some space here.

00:25.863 --> 00:27.731
Hey, watch it!

00:27.799 --> 00:30.534
- Call it in.
- Base, this is 7070.

00:30.602 --> 00:32.403
We're being robbed,
Dundas, west of Annette.

00:32.470 --> 00:34.204
Put down the radio
and get out of the truck!

00:34.272 --> 00:37.140
What do we do?

00:37.208 --> 00:40.476
We got ballistic glass, three quarter
inch chromium hardened plate armour.

00:40.544 --> 00:43.346
They couldn't get to us
with assault rifles.

00:43.414 --> 00:45.515
We're moving.

00:45.582 --> 00:47.950
(Gunshots)

00:51.488 --> 00:56.024
It's not possible. Base, this is 7070.
We need help now!

01:01.764 --> 01:03.799
Open the door and get out

01:03.866 --> 01:06.301
or you're both dead! Now!

01:10.039 --> 01:12.206
Pull him against the truck
and tie him down.

01:12.273 --> 01:14.241
(Guard groaning)

01:14.309 --> 01:16.811
Get the keys!
We've got less than a minute!

01:16.878 --> 01:18.979

- Is that what you're wearing?

02:32.170 --> 02:34.138
Yeah. What are you...

02:34.206 --> 02:37.241

Come on, we're going out.

02:37.309 --> 02:39.310

Our neighbour Gillian, her bar opening
is tonight. Come on, go get dressed.

02:43.414 --> 02:46.116
I've gotta finish this book on
modern homicide investigation.

02:46.183 --> 02:49.285
- What is this?
- Check it out.

02:49.353 --> 02:52.122
It's pretty insane.

02:52.189 --> 02:54.958
Oh, geez! It's bad enough
they killed the guy,

02:55.026 --> 02:56.927
they turned him
into a human puzzle.

02:56.995 --> 02:59.261
Why are you reading this?

02:59.329 --> 03:01.797
If I'm gonna work IIB,
I've gotta ramp up my skills.

03:01.865 --> 03:04.667
You can already read people's minds.
What more do they want from you?

03:04.735 --> 03:06.669
Ballistics,
criminal psychology,

03:06.737 --> 03:09.204
advanced interrogation
techniques. You know, skills.

03:09.272 --> 03:11.473
Why don't we leave
this disgusting book behind,

03:11.542 --> 03:13.509
and we can go down
to this bar opening,

03:13.576 --> 03:15.510
and you can interrogate
the bartenders.

03:15.578 --> 03:18.379
I'm halfway through a chapter
on the progress of lividity

03:18.447 --> 03:20.448
in the first 12 hours
after a homicide.

03:20.516 --> 03:22.750
I know what the progress
of lividity is.

03:22.817 --> 03:24.818
You know, I didn't even know
what lividity was.

03:24.886 --> 03:28.288
- Can't really say.
- Hi. What's up?

03:28.356 --> 03:30.858
Yeah?

03:30.926 --> 03:33.594
Ok, alright. Well, I'll...

03:33.662 --> 03:36.096
I'll be right there.

03:36.164 --> 03:38.565
- What's going on?
- That was Michelle.

03:38.632 --> 03:40.499
- We have a case.
- Oh, I see,

03:40.568 --> 03:42.569
Michelle calls, and then
you're right out the window.

03:42.636 --> 03:44.203
- I wear a tie...
- Make sure you lock the door.

03:44.271 --> 03:45.939
- I try to present myself well.
- Say hello to Gillian.

03:46.006 --> 03:48.274
And I'm going
by myself now? Thanks.

03:48.341 --> 03:50.977
"Modern homicide."

03:52.880 --> 03:54.880
Oh, my God,
I can't even touch the page.

03:54.948 --> 03:58.650
That is...
The floor of a slaughterhouse.

03:58.718 --> 04:00.719
Oh, that one's not so bad.

04:00.787 --> 04:02.754
- Thought you'd never get here.
- So how bad is it?

04:02.822 --> 04:04.790
The worst. Two cops are down.

04:04.857 --> 04:06.792
One is dead.
One is critically injured.

04:06.859 --> 04:09.094
One of these guards was shot
as well. Whoever did this,

04:09.161 --> 04:11.195
they're using
armour-piercing bullets.

04:11.262 --> 04:13.197
Cut through the officers' car,
her body armour

04:13.264 --> 04:15.866
- like it wasn't even there.
- Why isn't this a Metro case?

04:15.934 --> 04:18.135
The mayor's office
tagged us. If it gets out

04:18.202 --> 04:20.504
that the bad guys
are amping up their firepower,

04:20.572 --> 04:22.439
it could be a public relations
disaster.

04:22.507 --> 04:24.308
Do we have
the name of the dead officer?

04:24.375 --> 04:26.476
Carrie Foster.

04:29.360 --> 04:30.925
You knew her?

04:44.460 --> 04:48.363
Carrie graduated a few years
behind me in Police College.

04:48.431 --> 04:51.333
I just spoke with her.
She was...

04:51.400 --> 04:54.269
Studying for
her sergeant's exam.

04:54.337 --> 04:56.238
I'm sorry, Michelle.

04:56.305 --> 04:59.174
Do they need
someone to tell her mom?

04:59.242 --> 05:01.143
Her staff sergeant
was gonna break the news,

05:01.210 --> 05:03.111
but I'm sure
they could use your help.

05:03.179 --> 05:06.314
Do you need time? I can get Dev
to work with Toby on this.

05:06.382 --> 05:08.683
I'm fine.

05:08.751 --> 05:10.785
Alright.

05:10.853 --> 05:12.987
These bullets can cut halfway
through an apartment building,

05:13.055 --> 05:16.390
so let's get these cowboys off the
street before more innocent people die.

05:16.458 --> 05:19.893
Look, if you need any time...

05:19.961 --> 05:21.928
Let's do this.

05:21.996 --> 05:24.064
They took us by surprise.
I don't know...

05:24.132 --> 05:26.567
IIB.

05:26.635 --> 05:29.770
- What can you tell us?
- They shot him.

05:29.837 --> 05:31.937
They weren't supposed to be able
to do that. Ballistic glass.

05:32.005 --> 05:34.607
The guys who came at us
just had pistols.

05:34.675 --> 05:37.644
- How many of them were there?
- Four. I don't know,

05:37.711 --> 05:41.281
five maybe...
They were wearing masks.

05:41.348 --> 05:44.750
Hey, watch it!
Put down the radio!

05:44.818 --> 05:47.553
I gotta see my partner.
I gotta know that he's ok.

05:49.222 --> 05:51.423
Thank you.

05:52.659 --> 05:54.826
It's just like he said.
There were 5 of them.

05:54.894 --> 05:56.995
They got away in a gray car.
Looked like they had handguns.

05:57.063 --> 05:59.030
Glock 17s.

05:59.098 --> 06:00.932
You've been doing
your homework.

06:01.000 --> 06:04.535
Let's see what Dev can tell us.

06:08.039 --> 06:10.074
<i>Lethal projectiles 101.</i>

06:10.141 --> 06:13.711
Now, what these guys were firing
were 9mm armour-piercing bullets.

06:13.778 --> 06:16.480
It's a high explosive load
with a tungsten steel penetrator

06:16.548 --> 06:19.549
embedded in the projectile. When
the rest of the slug flattens,

06:19.617 --> 06:21.685
the penetrator
just keeps on going.

06:21.752 --> 06:25.422
It's designed to carry the maximum amount of
energy as deep as possible into the target.

06:25.489 --> 06:28.124
I mean, to go through a three
quarter inch plate of armour,

06:28.192 --> 06:31.328
they'd have to be 50% more powerful
than anything else on the market.

06:31.395 --> 06:34.130
So who manufactures them?

06:34.198 --> 06:38.200
Nobody. Nobody
commercially, anyway.

06:38.268 --> 06:40.402
These were hand loaded
by someone who knows exactly

06:40.470 --> 06:44.139
what they're doing. Like I said,
these are very special.

06:44.207 --> 06:47.376
So where does a bad guy
go to get bullets like this?

06:47.444 --> 06:49.712
I'm still trying to match
the profile, but we don't have

06:49.779 --> 06:52.247
anything like this
in the database.

06:52.314 --> 06:54.549
I'd say best bet is to go
old school, hit the streets.

06:54.617 --> 06:56.584
I know a guy who has his ear
to the ground

06:56.652 --> 07:00.020
for this kind of thing.
He'll know.

07:00.088 --> 07:02.357
<i>And here we have</i>

07:02.424 --> 07:04.559
the emergency room or ER

07:04.627 --> 07:06.593
as I like to call it.
I'm a big fan of acronyms.

07:06.661 --> 07:08.762
Oh, great! This will be
fabulous background

07:08.829 --> 07:11.131
for my article. It must get
pretty crazy in here sometimes.

07:11.198 --> 07:13.099
The staff here
is top notch. If you were

07:13.167 --> 07:15.034
to say anything about
the St. Luke's Emergency Room,

07:15.102 --> 07:16.503
it's that...

07:16.571 --> 07:19.740
You're always...

07:19.807 --> 07:21.875
Under control.
(Woman): Is it red?

07:21.942 --> 07:25.278
Excuse me. Hi. Hi.

07:25.345 --> 07:27.246
What are you doing here?

07:27.314 --> 07:29.448
It's a glam holiday side updo.

07:29.516 --> 07:31.517
No, I mean,
what are you doing here?

07:31.585 --> 07:33.686
- Where else would we be?
- Uh, I don't know.

07:33.754 --> 07:36.054
Any number of places that
is not an emergency room, maybe.

07:36.122 --> 07:40.158
It's her wedding in 2 hours. Bridesmaid got
brought in and she won't leave Cindy's side.

07:40.225 --> 07:43.928
Sounds like a bad case of muscle
relaxants and mimosas if you ask me.

07:43.996 --> 07:47.432
That is not a professional medical opinion.
Don't bother writing that. Hi, you are...?

07:47.500 --> 07:49.434
- Gorgeous!
- Ok...

07:49.502 --> 07:51.903
Gregory Gorgeous. Don't worry,
I'm not sick though.

07:51.970 --> 07:54.305
Just here visiting a friend.

07:54.372 --> 07:56.440
She has chest pains.
They say arrhythmia,

07:56.508 --> 07:58.409
but I'm pretty sure
it's just a broken heart.

07:58.476 --> 08:00.844
Oh, actually, heartache
can often resemble the symptoms

08:00.912 --> 08:03.380
of arrhythmia with the anxiety
and the spike in adrenaline...

08:03.448 --> 08:06.317
You might want to help those girls over there, though.
Blood and tartan hasn't been in

08:06.384 --> 08:08.352
since <i>Braveheart.</i>

08:08.420 --> 08:10.187
Yeah, I'll get right on that,
ok? Excuse me.

08:10.254 --> 08:12.488
Hey, Sandy, is it a full moon?

08:12.556 --> 08:14.757
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I thought it was me.

08:14.825 --> 08:17.293
Missy, this is Sandy Wardwell,
the head nurse here in the ER.

08:17.361 --> 08:20.229
And, Sandy, this is Missy Johnson. She's
writing that article on the hospital.

08:20.297 --> 08:23.265
Well, an inside look at a state
of the art medical facility.

08:23.334 --> 08:26.068
My interview with Mr. Bey has
been incredibly stimulating.

08:26.136 --> 08:29.604
If you think that's stimulating, you should
see him with some candles and red wine.

08:29.672 --> 08:32.240
Umm, you know what Missy, why don't
we have you meet some of the patients?

08:32.308 --> 08:34.467
The nurses can tell you all about the
topnotch service here at the hospital.

08:34.587 --> 08:35.341
There you go.

08:35.461 --> 08:37.645
Do you mind not piling it on?
I'm already having a hard time.

08:37.714 --> 08:39.648
I don't like talking to media,
gotta watch everything you say.

08:39.716 --> 08:41.750
Relax, ok? You're doing great.

08:41.818 --> 08:43.717
Did Toby give you a rain check
from last night?

08:43.784 --> 08:46.887
No, he still hasn't got back
to me. He's way too busy

08:46.955 --> 08:48.989
learning the entire Canadian
criminal code. He has no time

08:49.057 --> 08:51.058
to hang out with me and work
on a hangover, you know?

08:51.125 --> 08:53.661
(Sandy): You make it sound
so appealing.

08:53.729 --> 08:55.563
Baby sick! Somebody's
gotta help! Somebody?

08:55.630 --> 08:57.631
Ok, I think it's time
to call security.

08:57.699 --> 08:59.632
Mike, we're gonna
need 2 guards.

08:59.700 --> 09:02.068
It's not a real baby everybody.
It's fine. Just right there.

09:07.341 --> 09:09.308
McCluskey.

09:09.377 --> 09:11.444
Surprise seeing you here.

09:11.512 --> 09:14.146
Let me guess.
You missed me?

09:14.214 --> 09:16.281
A friend of mine
was just killed by one of these.

09:16.349 --> 09:20.753
AP bullets.
Home cooked.

09:20.820 --> 09:23.054
Yeah, well, last I checked,
sergeant, those were illegal.

09:23.122 --> 09:25.323
I've been out of all that
since the last time you saw me.

09:25.392 --> 09:27.659
- Who's selling them?
- I told you,

09:27.727 --> 09:29.695
I don't know
about illegal weapons or ammo.

09:34.600 --> 09:36.834
So then you don't mind
if the guns

09:36.902 --> 09:39.370
and gangs squad checks the
false wall in your apartment?

09:39.438 --> 09:42.407
I imagine there's enough
illegal ordinance there

09:42.474 --> 09:45.743
- to start a small army.
- Tell us about the bullets.

09:48.880 --> 09:50.881
Ok, well I might know
a couple of people

09:50.948 --> 09:52.916
who might know how to do
that kind of work.

09:52.983 --> 09:56.319
We're gonna need
names and numbers.

09:59.924 --> 10:02.191
So that's it?
He gives us a few names,

10:02.259 --> 10:04.192
we let him go on the guns?

10:04.260 --> 10:06.328
No, no. Guns and gangs
will be here

10:06.396 --> 10:08.531
in about 20 minutes having
a field day with this guy.

10:08.598 --> 10:10.966
Nice.

10:19.309 --> 10:21.709
How you doing?

10:21.777 --> 10:24.546
I told you. I'm fine.

10:24.613 --> 10:26.648
You wanna tell me
about Carrie?

10:31.421 --> 10:34.289
We met when I, um...

10:34.357 --> 10:37.358
when I went to go talk
to her class.

10:37.426 --> 10:39.427
I'd been moving up the ranks
pretty quickly,

10:39.494 --> 10:42.763
and I guess they thought
I had something to share.

10:42.831 --> 10:45.632
So I told them about real life,
what to expect,

10:45.700 --> 10:48.269
what they would get out
of school, what they wouldn't.

10:48.337 --> 10:50.304
When they started asking
questions, most of the kids

10:50.372 --> 10:54.074
just wanted to know about...

10:54.141 --> 10:57.110
how to advance...
when to expect a pay raise.

10:59.313 --> 11:02.148
But Carrie was different.

11:02.216 --> 11:06.286
She wanted to know
why I got into this job.

11:06.354 --> 11:10.089
And what I cared about.

11:10.156 --> 11:13.058
If I ever had
to compromise my...

11:13.126 --> 11:15.160
morality or judgment.

11:16.964 --> 11:19.532
I told them about regrets

11:19.600 --> 11:21.501
and fears...

11:21.568 --> 11:23.635
And all the times
they would question

11:23.703 --> 11:26.605
why they had even gotten
into the job in the first place.

11:28.808 --> 11:32.043
I think that scared some of
the kids off but Carrie, umm...

11:34.413 --> 11:37.582
She just sat there nodding.

11:37.650 --> 11:39.617
Like she had figured
it all out,

11:39.684 --> 11:42.786
and I had just
given her confirmation.

11:42.854 --> 11:44.788
She did her job with honor

11:44.856 --> 11:47.457
right up 'til the end.

11:49.427 --> 11:51.629
Yeah. I just wish
I would have warned her off

11:51.696 --> 11:53.664
a little bit more.

11:57.834 --> 11:59.968
<i>So they retrieved</i>
<i>the getaway car.</i>

12:00.036 --> 12:01.937
It was reported stolen from
a parking lot in the east end.

12:02.005 --> 12:04.873
Forensics is working it for prints,
but they haven't found anything.

12:04.941 --> 12:06.875
There won't be any.
These guys are pros.

12:06.943 --> 12:09.044
I also received
the armored car report.

12:09.111 --> 12:11.079
The loss was close to 350,000.

12:11.147 --> 12:13.581
Ah, so that's what a cop's
life is worth.

12:13.649 --> 12:16.250
Check back in with the company
and see if any of their employees

12:16.317 --> 12:18.509
- have leaked routes or schedules, ok?
- Right.

12:18.629 --> 12:20.181
What do you think?
They're gonna strike again?

12:20.301 --> 12:21.461
These guys killed cops.

12:21.581 --> 12:24.653
There's no fear there.
It's not a matter of if, it's when.

12:24.773 --> 12:27.227
I'm still working my way
through your dealer's list,

12:27.295 --> 12:28.692
but a lot of these guys
are hard to track down.

12:28.812 --> 12:30.089
I guess they don't have
web pages, do they?

12:30.209 --> 12:31.166
If only.

12:31.286 --> 12:34.706
No, 2 of them are in jail.
And 3 of them moved out of town.

12:34.969 --> 12:36.637
Vancouver, Montreal,

12:36.704 --> 12:39.172
Winnipeg. There's a couple
I'm still trying to find.

12:39.240 --> 12:41.642
- Ok.
- Dev, pull up the local news.

12:42.954 --> 12:45.293
<i>Superintendent Martell, is this part
of an emerging pattern?</i>

12:45.413 --> 12:46.527
<i>Have you caught the shooter?</i>

12:46.647 --> 12:49.315
<i>It's an ongoing investigation,
we have promising leads.</i>

12:49.383 --> 12:52.851
<i>The thieves were using armour-piercing
ammunition. Where did they get it?</i>

12:52.919 --> 12:56.370
<i>Catching the gunmen and getting
the bullets off the street</i>

12:56.490 --> 12:59.725
<i>is our number one priority.</i>
<i>I have an elite IIB team</i>

12:59.793 --> 13:02.026
<i>- led by Alvin Klein on top of it.
- Ha!</i>

13:02.094 --> 13:03.928
<i>We'll have answers</i>
<i>in the next 24 hours.</i>

13:03.996 --> 13:06.731
<i>- Superintendent Martell...</i>
<i>- That's all for now.</i>

13:06.799 --> 13:09.768
- Hm!
- That's the new superintendent.

13:09.835 --> 13:12.337
Determined to make first
female commissioner by age 40.

13:12.405 --> 13:14.972
She mentioned you by name.
She's got a lot of faith.

13:15.040 --> 13:17.008
No, she just told everybody
who to blame

13:17.075 --> 13:19.010
if we don't take
these guys down quickly.

13:19.077 --> 13:21.846
Playing politics with one cop
in the morgue.

13:21.914 --> 13:25.481
Trouble runs downhill. We just happen to
be at the bottom of the hill right now.

13:25.549 --> 13:29.085
Guys, I think I got something
on one of the guys on the list.

13:29.153 --> 13:31.087
His name is Grant Bogle.

13:31.155 --> 13:34.457
I did a background check on him.
It seems he worked

13:34.525 --> 13:37.093
as an engineer at a mechanical
company up until 6 months ago.

13:37.161 --> 13:40.329
Past tense.
What is he up to now?

13:40.396 --> 13:43.632
Well, the company went under.
No further employment records.

13:43.700 --> 13:45.767
What about criminal record?

13:45.836 --> 13:48.570
That's the thing. No arrests,
no flags or anything,

13:48.638 --> 13:51.506
but it seems that he went to the
Department of National Defense

13:51.574 --> 13:53.843
and tried to sell them
a brand new type

13:53.910 --> 13:56.044
of small caliber
armour-piercing ammunition.

13:56.111 --> 13:59.981
Also, the application says it's 9mm.
It's the same as our shooters.

14:00.049 --> 14:03.484
Why does a research engineer
start robbing armored cars?

14:03.552 --> 14:06.154
Let's ask him.
Dev, do you have an address?

14:06.222 --> 14:08.089
- I'll send it to your phone.
- I'll scramble a team

14:08.157 --> 14:10.024
- to meet you there.
- Ok. Let's go.

14:10.092 --> 14:12.025
(Siren)

14:18.933 --> 14:22.102
IIB! We have a warrant!

14:22.170 --> 14:25.172
Check the living room!
Go! Go! Go!

14:25.240 --> 14:28.074
- Move!
- Upstairs, clear!

14:28.141 --> 14:30.176
Clear!

14:40.687 --> 14:43.788
IIB! Hands in the air!

14:43.856 --> 14:47.158
- Stop right there!
- Michelle...

14:47.226 --> 14:50.661
He's not armed!
He's not armed.

14:54.300 --> 14:57.502
(Door opening)
Don't move! Don't move!

14:57.569 --> 14:59.570
Show me your hands!

15:08.179 --> 15:11.783
Looks like we found
our cop killer.

15:11.850 --> 15:13.284
(Handcuffs clicking)

15:23.834 --> 15:25.897
I told you I don't know
anything about a shooting.

15:26.017 --> 15:28.107
You must be the one person
in town who doesn't.

15:28.227 --> 15:30.278
You don't watch the news?

15:30.783 --> 15:33.511
- No. I've been, I've been busy.
- Yeah, Mr. Bogle,

15:33.631 --> 15:36.288
I'm not sure you understand
what's going on here,

15:36.408 --> 15:38.643
- how much trouble you're in.
- I didn't do anything.

15:38.783 --> 15:42.953
You manufactured the bullets that killed a
friend of mine and injured 2 other people.

15:43.021 --> 15:45.122
(Bogle): <i>I didn't make</i>
<i>them for this.</i>

15:45.189 --> 15:47.290
You're looking at spending
the rest of your life in prison.

15:47.358 --> 15:50.127
You know, you don't have
to take the heat for all this.

15:50.194 --> 15:52.328
There are ways
you can help yourself.

15:52.396 --> 15:54.329
You just tell us
who you worked with.

15:54.397 --> 15:56.331
- I'm not working with anybody.
- Come on.

15:56.399 --> 15:59.635
I'm an engineer.
I'm an inventor.

16:01.571 --> 16:03.939
I mean, I tried selling them
to armed forces. I contacted

16:04.007 --> 16:05.975
the Department of National
Defense, the U.S. Military.

16:06.043 --> 16:07.943
- I've got records!
- So, what is it?

16:08.011 --> 16:11.012
You lost your job? You tried
to sell the bullets underground

16:11.080 --> 16:14.149
- to make some quick cash?
- No! No! No!

16:14.216 --> 16:17.285
I wouldn't hurt anybody.

16:17.352 --> 16:19.921
- Especially not a police officer.
- Your bullets!

16:19.989 --> 16:22.991
You're the one
that's gonna wear it!

16:23.059 --> 16:26.160
Ok...

16:26.227 --> 16:29.963
I, uh...

16:30.031 --> 16:32.900
I sold conventional shells for hunters,
but you can buy those anywhere.

16:32.967 --> 16:36.003
Now the armour-piercing bullets,
those were experimental,

16:36.071 --> 16:40.440
so I wouldn't have sold them.
So how did they get used?

16:44.878 --> 16:46.813
I was robbed
a couple of months ago.

16:46.880 --> 16:48.915
They took my television
and some jewelry.

16:55.923 --> 16:59.057
I filed a report with the police.
You can check if you want to.

16:59.125 --> 17:01.827
You're saying that you
reported the bullets stolen?

17:05.098 --> 17:08.400
No. I know,
it's stupid. I was scared.

17:08.468 --> 17:10.001
I didn't want to get
into trouble. I just hoped

17:10.069 --> 17:12.338
that they didn't know what they
had and they wouldn't get used.

17:12.405 --> 17:14.472
How many did they get?

17:14.540 --> 17:17.007
One rack. 120.

17:17.075 --> 17:19.977
That and the ones you found
in my shop, that's all I have.

17:28.687 --> 17:30.621
- Now, you're lying.
- No.

17:30.688 --> 17:32.956
You are lying. You were
at the scene of the shooting.

17:33.023 --> 17:35.859
No, no, no! I was
at an AA meeting last night!

17:35.926 --> 17:38.962
- So you just planned it, then?
- No! No!

17:45.202 --> 17:47.169
Mr. Bogle is free to go.

17:47.237 --> 17:50.205
- What!?
- His lawyer has arranged bail.

17:50.274 --> 17:51.919
No. This is not happening.

17:52.039 --> 17:54.494
I want to see both of you
in my office, now.

17:55.945 --> 17:58.013
You're gonna be just fine, ok?

18:03.018 --> 18:04.952
What the hell was that?

18:05.270 --> 18:07.586
His lawyer got to
Judge Hewitt.

18:07.706 --> 18:09.607
He got lawyered up pretty fast.

18:09.675 --> 18:11.643
Yes, it's always this way
with cases like this.

18:11.710 --> 18:15.179
Lawyers are all over it. Everybody
wants to be in the news.

18:15.247 --> 18:17.515
And the judge believes
that the bullets were stolen?

18:17.582 --> 18:20.851
Well, he did file a robbery
report a couple months back.

18:20.919 --> 18:23.022
Yeah, but that doesn't mean that's
when the bullets switched hands.

18:23.142 --> 18:25.889
Yes, but between that
and his application

18:25.957 --> 18:28.258
to the Department of Defense...
And the fact that he has

18:28.325 --> 18:30.794
an airtight alibi
for the night of the murder,

18:30.862 --> 18:33.629
the judge felt
there was a case for bail.

18:33.697 --> 18:36.065
As much as we
don't like it sometimes,

18:36.132 --> 18:39.535
there is still a thing
called due process.

18:39.603 --> 18:41.637
Yeah, well,
the guy killed a cop,

18:41.705 --> 18:44.840
- it doesn't get worse than this.
- Actually...

18:44.908 --> 18:47.944
Alvin Klein?

18:48.011 --> 18:50.845
It might.
Here we go.

18:50.913 --> 18:52.948
I've been telling the press
we had our guy.

18:53.068 --> 18:54.229
You just made me look
like an idiot.

18:54.349 --> 18:56.720
With all due respect,
it wasn't me that did that.

18:56.840 --> 18:58.369
How did you let him
slip through your fingers?

18:58.489 --> 19:00.855
- Ask the judge.
- You should have a confession!

19:00.923 --> 19:03.224
- We were working on it.
- And you failed.

19:03.292 --> 19:06.359
What would you have
recommended? Waterboarding?

19:06.427 --> 19:08.996
- I need you to make this right.
- Oh, we're gonna find

19:09.064 --> 19:11.364
who killed Officer Foster
and apprehend them.

19:11.432 --> 19:13.533
Not looking like an idiot
is something you're gonna have

19:13.602 --> 19:15.569
to work on yourself... sir.

19:15.637 --> 19:18.138
They told me
you were a smartass.

19:18.206 --> 19:21.008
I don't know what's so damn
special about your unit

19:21.076 --> 19:24.577
that you've been getting carte blanche
from this organization for so long,

19:24.645 --> 19:26.846
but you'd better show me.

19:26.914 --> 19:29.181
Fast.

19:33.787 --> 19:35.755
(Klein exhaling)

19:35.823 --> 19:37.756
What? I thought
that went well, didn't you?

19:37.824 --> 19:39.758
- Yeah.
- Pretty good.

19:39.826 --> 19:42.728
Listen. Dev just texted me. He
says that there's no connection

19:42.795 --> 19:45.497
between the bank
and the armored car company.

19:45.564 --> 19:47.499
Alright. So our prime suspect
walks out the door,

19:47.566 --> 19:49.567
and the only thing
we have to connect him

19:49.635 --> 19:52.103
- is these bullets that he made?
- I read Bogle.

19:52.171 --> 19:54.639
Nothing clear,
but it does appear that

19:54.706 --> 19:57.041
there really was a break-in, and
I saw someone threatening him.

19:57.109 --> 19:59.743
- I don't know what that means.
- It doesn't mean that he's innocent.

19:59.810 --> 20:02.412
Also, at one point when we
were talking about the bullets,

20:02.480 --> 20:04.714
I saw a red door
with a sign, Astarte, on it.

20:04.782 --> 20:07.884
- Maybe we get Dev on that.
- Yeah, definitely. It would be nice

20:07.952 --> 20:10.254
to have something more concrete
than Toby's reads.

20:10.321 --> 20:12.189
- Sure.
- Yeah. In the meantime,

20:12.257 --> 20:14.224
I have something
I have to take care of.

20:14.292 --> 20:16.859
- Maybe you want to come with me?
- Yeah.

20:41.784 --> 20:45.220
Welcome to the hardest part.

20:45.288 --> 20:49.490
Look, I can't imagine how
you feel right now, Michelle.

20:54.062 --> 20:56.397
Michelle.

21:19.019 --> 21:22.588
You did good back there. And I
think you really helped her out.

21:22.655 --> 21:24.889
Helping her would be getting
the guy who killed her daughter

21:24.957 --> 21:27.226
instead of letting a creep like
Bogle back out on the street.

21:27.293 --> 21:29.695
Michelle. We've gotta
entertain the possibility

21:29.762 --> 21:31.730
- that he didn't do it.
- Well, even if he didn't,

21:31.797 --> 21:34.032
he knows who did and he's not
talking. That's just as bad.

21:34.100 --> 21:36.534
(Phone ringing)

21:36.602 --> 21:38.393
- Yeah?
Dev: <i>- Hey Michelle, it's me.</i>

21:38.513 --> 21:40.280
I looked up the word "Astarte"
from Toby's read.

21:40.400 --> 21:41.653
It turns out it's
the engineering company

21:41.773 --> 21:43.708
<i>that Bogle worked for
before it closed up.</i>

21:43.775 --> 21:45.447
Ok, so what are you saying?
It's a dead end?

21:45.567 --> 21:46.958
<i>No. The building's
still for sale,</i>

21:47.078 --> 21:49.046
But it hasn't
been occupied since.

21:49.114 --> 21:52.415
- The door I saw in my read might be there.
- Dev, do you have an address?

21:52.483 --> 21:56.720
- It's 2700, Eastern Avenue.
- Ok, we'll check it out. Thanks.

21:56.787 --> 21:58.622
♪

21:58.689 --> 22:00.823
(Siren)

22:18.174 --> 22:21.143
Yeah, this is the sign I saw.
And that's the red door.

22:21.210 --> 22:23.544
(Car starting up)

22:26.248 --> 22:28.449
- What the hell was that? Alright?
- Yeah.

22:28.517 --> 22:30.618
- Did you get the plate?
- Got it.

22:30.686 --> 22:32.820
Whoa!

22:32.888 --> 22:35.189
Yeah, let's go in.

22:54.776 --> 22:58.076
There's more of these out there,
and the shooters have them.

22:58.144 --> 23:01.013
You still think
Bogle's innocent?

23:09.522 --> 23:11.423
So I've checked up on the van
you saw racing away

23:11.491 --> 23:14.502
from Astarte. The license plate
was stolen a couple weeks ago.

23:14.622 --> 23:16.881
Ok, so we know
that Bogle lied, and we know

23:17.001 --> 23:18.846
there are more bullets,
and he knew where they were.

23:18.914 --> 23:21.049
We have to assume the same
people did the shooting.

23:21.117 --> 23:23.218
We should also assume they're
gonna use those bullets soon.

23:23.285 --> 23:26.420
They didn't get what they wanted from
the first heist, and the heat's on.

23:26.488 --> 23:28.288
If they were forcing him
to make the bullets,

23:28.356 --> 23:30.391
why doesn't he just tell us?
We could help him, right?

23:30.458 --> 23:33.297
Well, just because he was threatened
doesn't mean he wasn't involved.

23:33.417 --> 23:35.642
Ok, let's pay our
bullet maker another visit.

23:35.762 --> 23:37.308
Yup, ok.

23:47.641 --> 23:50.576
What are you guys doing here?

23:50.644 --> 23:53.979
- You're not happy to see us?
- You ripped my house apart.

23:54.048 --> 23:55.981
You arrest me.
Why should I be?

23:56.050 --> 23:58.050
We're here to give you
the benefit of the doubt.

23:58.117 --> 24:01.653
- I don't have time for games.
- You lied about having more bullets.

24:01.720 --> 24:05.190
You or someone you work with just
picked some up from your old workplace

24:05.258 --> 24:07.361
- where you were hiding them.
- There are no more bullets.

24:07.481 --> 24:09.333
Mr. Bogle, we know
there are more bullets.

24:09.453 --> 24:11.883
We know they were used to kill
an officer the other day.

24:12.003 --> 24:13.394
We know someone's
threatening you.

24:13.514 --> 24:16.233
You gotta trust us,
we can help you.

24:18.403 --> 24:20.371
Please!

24:20.439 --> 24:22.673
You guys don't know
what you're talking about.

24:22.740 --> 24:25.376
I told you, I don't know
anything about any bullets.

24:25.444 --> 24:28.512
They threatened
someone you care about.

24:28.580 --> 24:32.148
I'm scared! Just give him
what he wants, please!

24:35.386 --> 24:38.961
If you're not here
to arrest me, we're done here.

24:39.081 --> 24:39.981
Ok, I don't think
you understand

24:40.101 --> 24:42.276
- Michelle.
- how this works...

24:43.327 --> 24:45.828
You know where to reach us
if you change your mind.

24:45.896 --> 24:47.929
We can help you.

24:54.737 --> 24:57.078
What was that about?
I was just getting warmed up.

24:57.198 --> 24:58.778
He wasn't going to tell
us anything, Michelle.

24:58.898 --> 25:00.490
Well I guess you haven't
seen me warmed up.

25:00.610 --> 25:03.344
They've got someone
he cares about. I saw a woman.

25:03.412 --> 25:05.846
It could be his daughter,
a niece, I don't know.

25:05.914 --> 25:08.483
This is Amy Bogle.
She's 22 years old.

25:08.550 --> 25:10.518
Bogle's only daughter.

25:10.586 --> 25:12.386
I saw her being threatened
when I read Bogle.

25:12.454 --> 25:14.288
Well, there's no evidence
of her at the house.

25:14.356 --> 25:17.024
She's been out of the house
for the last 3 years.

25:17.092 --> 25:19.058
She studied psychology
at U of T,

25:19.127 --> 25:21.595
and she graduated 2 years ago.
She's been working as a temp,

25:21.662 --> 25:25.132
but the agency she works through said she
hasn't called in for work in a few weeks.

25:25.199 --> 25:27.267
So, have we checked
her apartment?

25:27.335 --> 25:29.736
Yeah. There was some food
that had gone bad in the fridge.

25:29.803 --> 25:33.072
Her neighbours said she kept to herself, but
they haven't seen her in a little while either.

25:33.141 --> 25:35.407
Did you have any luck putting
together an image of the guy

25:35.475 --> 25:38.944
that Toby saw threatening her?
Yeah.

25:39.012 --> 25:41.180
Voila!

25:41.248 --> 25:43.649
Yeah. It's a little bit
thinner, but it's pretty close.

25:43.716 --> 25:46.752
I still haven't got a match, but I'm
widening out to other databases.

25:46.819 --> 25:49.555
If this guy has those bullets,
and he's planning another job,

25:49.623 --> 25:52.257
we have to figure out what it is
and cut him off at the pass.

25:52.324 --> 25:53.918
The problem is
Bogle is our only way in,

25:54.038 --> 25:55.872
but because he's protecting
his daughter

25:55.992 --> 25:57.606
he's the last person who's
going to talk right now.

25:57.863 --> 26:01.065
Then it's up to you, Dev. We
need to know who he is and fast.

26:01.133 --> 26:04.302
Have I mentioned how much I don't
like working under pressure?

26:04.370 --> 26:06.270
Trust me. The pressure
hasn't even started yet.

26:06.337 --> 26:09.005
I have to bring Martell
up to speed.

26:09.073 --> 26:11.408
This could take some time.

26:11.476 --> 26:13.477
Well, there's no point
in both of us staring

26:13.545 --> 26:15.107
over Dev's shoulder. I'll give
you a call if anything comes up.

26:15.227 --> 26:17.681
- Yeah? Ok.
- Yeah.

26:17.748 --> 26:21.318
You're not literal... you're gonna
stare over my shoulder the whole time.

26:23.320 --> 26:26.255
So then the managing editor
says, "I think you'd be great

26:26.323 --> 26:28.658
at blogging!" And I say,

26:28.725 --> 26:31.159
"We're doing news here, Gabe.
Blogging is for people

26:31.227 --> 26:33.228
sitting in their basements
writing about their cats."

26:37.200 --> 26:39.167
And then I said,

26:39.235 --> 26:41.403
"I want to do a feature story

26:41.470 --> 26:43.938
about chimpanzee drug gangs."

26:46.508 --> 26:49.943
Mmmhmm. That would be
an interesting story.

26:50.011 --> 26:51.978
(Tia laughing) Toby...

26:52.046 --> 26:55.316
- That'd be good. What?
- You're not even here.

26:55.383 --> 26:57.318
Alright, I'm sorry.

26:57.385 --> 27:01.054
The officer who was killed
was a friend of Michelle's.

27:01.122 --> 27:03.189
Oh, I'm sorry.

27:03.257 --> 27:05.625
And Michelle brought me
to go see the officer's mother.

27:05.693 --> 27:09.095
She said it was gonna be
something I have to get used to.

27:09.162 --> 27:12.164
I'm not sure that I want to.

27:12.233 --> 27:14.767
And...

27:14.835 --> 27:17.103
Seeing the mother cry,

27:17.170 --> 27:20.239
and seeing Michelle torn up, I don't
know, just, it was real, you know?

27:20.306 --> 27:22.841
Hmm..

27:22.908 --> 27:24.843
- Do you love what you're doing?
- I do.

27:24.910 --> 27:26.811
More than anything
I've ever done.

27:26.879 --> 27:29.248
Well, then that's your answer.
You can't not be doing it.

27:29.315 --> 27:33.151
Toby, you're different
than them.

27:33.219 --> 27:36.387
'Cause most of the time, they can
keep a distance from other people.

27:36.455 --> 27:38.489
But I've watched you, and you...

27:38.557 --> 27:41.359
feel too much for others.

27:43.362 --> 27:46.297
And you're doing that thing
again, shutting me out.

27:46.365 --> 27:48.232
What? Hey, come on,
we're talking.

27:48.300 --> 27:50.333
- I'm open to you.
- You talk about things

27:50.368 --> 27:52.435
that are safe and nice.

27:52.503 --> 27:54.537
How come I always feel

27:54.605 --> 27:56.673
like there's this whole
other side you're hiding?

27:59.610 --> 28:03.246
Alright, you wanna
hear my story?

28:03.314 --> 28:05.248
I was taken from my mother
when I was a kid,

28:05.315 --> 28:07.182
and I was raised in a bunch

28:07.250 --> 28:10.486
of crap... foster homes.

28:10.587 --> 28:13.589
I ran with some bad kids
and I was in juvie for a while.

28:15.558 --> 28:17.993
There was a point where I knew
I didn't want that,

28:18.060 --> 28:21.463
so I knew my way out
was through helping people.

28:21.531 --> 28:23.464
But Toby, I've been
a reporter long enough

28:23.532 --> 28:25.801
to know when there's a story
behind the story.

28:25.868 --> 28:27.836
And that's where I need to go.

28:27.904 --> 28:29.905
I'm not one
of your stories, Tia.

28:29.972 --> 28:32.007
Come on, maybe
the more you know

28:32.074 --> 28:34.109
about what's going on
inside someone's head,

28:34.177 --> 28:36.011
the less you really
understand about them.

28:36.078 --> 28:38.378
Hmm...

28:38.446 --> 28:41.415
So you're not just a mystery,
you're a philosopher.

28:41.482 --> 28:44.551
- Didn't buy that, did you?
- No. Ha! Ha! Ha!

28:44.619 --> 28:47.654
Something like that. (Cell phone
ringing) You don't give up.

28:49.624 --> 28:53.194
I gotta take this.
Hey, what's up?

28:53.261 --> 28:55.295
Toby, it's going sideways.
Martell just gave

28:55.362 --> 28:57.997
a press conference saying that
Bogle is cooperating with us,

28:58.065 --> 29:00.166
and the case should be cleared
within the next 24 hours.

29:00.234 --> 29:02.135
But he didn't say anything.

29:02.203 --> 29:03.970
<i>I guess she's trying
to scare him</i>

29:04.038 --> 29:05.272
Into asking for protection.

29:05.392 --> 29:08.069
Alright, well, she has
just signed his death warrant.

29:08.189 --> 29:11.077
Yeah. Listen I'm on my way to you now.
We need to get to him first.

29:11.197 --> 29:12.674
<i>- I'll see you soon.</i>
- Oaky.

29:12.794 --> 29:14.679
Bogle?

29:16.682 --> 29:18.650
You did not hear any of this.

29:18.718 --> 29:21.186
What I hear when we're
together is just between us.

29:21.254 --> 29:24.156
- You know that.
- Alright.

29:24.224 --> 29:28.059
Alright. I'll...
I'll call you later.

29:28.126 --> 29:29.593
Yes.

29:29.661 --> 29:33.130
Here. This one's on me.

29:33.198 --> 29:35.166
My treat.
Thank you.

29:35.234 --> 29:37.568
- See you later. Bye.
- Bye.

29:41.373 --> 29:44.407
What makes Martell think
outing Bogle's a good idea?

29:44.475 --> 29:46.809
Either he gets spooked and
talks or he gets himself killed.

29:46.878 --> 29:49.112
Martell wins either way,
right? I mean, we take out

29:49.180 --> 29:51.047
the real bad guys or the public
gets the satisfaction

29:51.115 --> 29:53.216
of seeing him get convicted.

29:53.284 --> 29:55.952
Maybe this is the one thing that
shakes him enough to actually talk.

29:56.020 --> 29:59.054
All we can do now is make sure
this doesn't get any worse.

29:59.122 --> 30:01.223
(Phone ringing) Yeah?

30:01.291 --> 30:04.026
Dev: <i>Hey, Michelle, I think I have
a name for Toby's mystery man.</i>

30:04.094 --> 30:07.863
His name is Kurt Marker,
and he is a scary, scary dude.

30:07.931 --> 30:11.133
<i>He has a history of violent crime
stretching back to his early teens.</i>

30:11.201 --> 30:14.102
Manslaughter, a string
of suspected homicides

30:14.169 --> 30:16.104
they haven't been able
to tie to him.

30:16.171 --> 30:19.140
<i>They say, he makes a point
of not leaving witnesses.</i>

30:19.208 --> 30:22.576
Ok, is there any connection to the
bank or the security company?

30:22.644 --> 30:26.314
- No. Nothing I could find.
- Do we have a location on him, Dev?

30:26.382 --> 30:28.416
<i>He got out of prison
about 3 months ago,</i>

30:28.483 --> 30:31.684
And fell off the parole board's radar. I'm
sending a description out to the troops.

30:31.752 --> 30:34.754
Ok. We'll check back in
after we get Bogle. Thanks.

30:43.898 --> 30:45.832
What have you done to me?

30:45.900 --> 30:47.377
You told the press
that I was helping you!?

30:47.497 --> 30:48.311
No that wasn't us.

30:48.431 --> 30:50.636
But it shouldn't matter because you
don't know anything about it, right.

30:50.703 --> 30:53.872
It's a lie! Now you tell them,
tell them to take it back!

30:53.941 --> 30:58.144
We know they have your daughter.
We want to help you get her back.

30:58.211 --> 31:01.447
We know about Kurt Marker, ok? We're
just trying to help you here.

31:01.514 --> 31:05.150
- I didn't even know his name.
- What's he planning to do with the bullets?

31:05.217 --> 31:07.252
I don't know.
He said he would kill her

31:07.320 --> 31:10.088
- if I didn't supply him.
- You gotta know something

31:10.156 --> 31:12.357
about him. A contact, anything?
It was 2 weeks ago.

31:12.425 --> 31:14.692
He stopped me on the street.
He told me he had Amy.

31:14.760 --> 31:17.128
That's all I...
(Gunshot)

31:20.432 --> 31:23.267
(Two gunshots)

31:23.335 --> 31:27.171
Michelle, call an ambulance!

31:36.896 --> 31:39.331
(Indistinct talking)

31:39.399 --> 31:42.267
Hey! Are you sure
you're ok, man?

31:42.335 --> 31:44.523
- Yeah, yeah, yeah!
- It's messed up, what happened.

31:44.770 --> 31:47.906
It's this new superintendent trying to put
the screws to him. Set him up to get shot.

31:47.974 --> 31:50.174
Bet you didn't read that in
<i>Modern Homicide Investigation.</i>

31:50.242 --> 31:52.744
Solving crimes is one thing.
Politics is another.

31:52.812 --> 31:54.679
It's a dirty game,
it's why I stay out of it.

31:54.747 --> 31:56.681
- Yeah, right?
- They said if you want

31:56.749 --> 31:58.650
to see him, it's ok.
Ok. He's gonna make it.

31:58.718 --> 32:00.784
Can we get in there
to talk to him?

32:00.852 --> 32:03.687
- Yeah, a couple of minutes.
- Michelle, we're good. Thank you.

32:03.755 --> 32:05.808
- Don't go too hard on him.
- Thanks.

32:05.928 --> 32:08.626
So a patient in triage 6
needs a CBC test.

32:08.693 --> 32:10.483
You might as well check blood
serum while you're at it.

32:10.603 --> 32:11.400
Sure.

32:11.520 --> 32:12.773
Excuse me.

32:12.893 --> 32:15.132
- Missy, right?
- Right.

32:15.199 --> 32:17.079
Did you get everything
you need for your story?

32:17.199 --> 32:20.569
I'm sure I do. I just wanted to ask, I
won't catch anything from being here

32:20.689 --> 32:22.596
the last few days, will I?

32:22.716 --> 32:24.240
Nothing more than
a case of boredom.

32:24.307 --> 32:27.844
- Ah, ok.
- So when is this story coming out?

32:27.911 --> 32:30.713
Oh, uh, well,
it should be out by...

32:30.781 --> 32:33.815
you know, it's pretty
competitive to get column space

32:33.883 --> 32:35.717
- these days.
- Are you even writing a story?

32:35.785 --> 32:39.988
Yes. Of course. It's just that
I'm not exactly a reporter yet.

32:40.108 --> 32:40.799
Excuse me?

32:40.919 --> 32:43.224
When I got out of journalism school,
the only job I could get

32:43.292 --> 32:45.560
was in the mail room.
But I'm a great reporter,

32:45.628 --> 32:47.963
and I need this story.
This will make my career.

32:48.031 --> 32:50.865
Promise you won't tell?

32:50.932 --> 32:53.000
You have my word.

32:53.068 --> 32:55.602
Ok. Thank you.

32:58.372 --> 33:00.907
Wasn't the full moon
over yesterday?

33:00.975 --> 33:04.343
Mr. Bogle, we're not...
happy with what happened here,

33:04.411 --> 33:06.646
but what's important
is finding your daughter.

33:06.714 --> 33:08.614
I told you, I don't know
where they are.

33:08.683 --> 33:11.284
They knew about
your bullets somehow.

33:11.351 --> 33:13.752
None of them knew about
the armour-piercing shells.

33:13.820 --> 33:17.422
- Did your daughter know about them?
- Yeah, I showed her.

33:17.490 --> 33:21.226
I wanted her...
you know, to be proud of me.

33:21.294 --> 33:23.261
Ok, maybe she told a friend?

33:23.329 --> 33:26.065
I don't know her friends...

33:26.132 --> 33:28.066
it's part of the problem.

33:28.133 --> 33:30.768
Look, after my wife died,

33:30.836 --> 33:33.337
I, uh...

33:33.405 --> 33:35.339
I couldn't deal with it,

33:35.407 --> 33:37.408
and Amy needed me,

33:37.475 --> 33:40.611
and I just disappeared
into my work, and I started

33:40.679 --> 33:43.181
drinking more
and then she just finally left,

33:43.248 --> 33:45.615
and she got her own life.
You know, I've been...

33:45.683 --> 33:47.751
trying to get back to her.

33:47.819 --> 33:51.621
There's gotta be something that
you know about your daughter

33:51.689 --> 33:53.590
or a place that she hangs out,

33:53.657 --> 33:56.893
an activity
that she does, friends.

33:56.961 --> 34:00.329
She visited
about a month ago, and,

34:00.396 --> 34:03.132
as she was leaving, she asked me
to drop her off somewhere.

34:03.200 --> 34:05.367
It was a.... it was a club.

34:05.435 --> 34:07.136
I wouldn't have driven you here
<i>I'm meeting my friends!</i>

34:07.204 --> 34:09.105
Do you know anything
about my life at all?

34:09.172 --> 34:11.172
I would like to know something
about your life, but...

34:11.241 --> 34:13.208
- Too late!
- Get back in here!

34:13.275 --> 34:15.677
It's so great that you're
trying to be a dad now...

34:15.745 --> 34:17.178
Get back in here!<i>I didn't</i>
<i>like the look of the place.</i>

34:17.246 --> 34:19.614
<i>We got into arguing about it.</i>

34:26.655 --> 34:28.556
It's the last I saw of her

34:28.623 --> 34:31.592
before they took her, and, uh...

34:31.659 --> 34:33.592
I had to end it
with an argument.

34:33.661 --> 34:35.862
Do you remember
the name of the club?

34:35.929 --> 34:37.898
That's Club Nine.
It's on Queen West.

34:37.966 --> 34:40.333
Ok.

34:40.400 --> 34:42.835
Just please find her.

34:42.904 --> 34:45.172
I need one chance
just to make it right with her.

34:45.239 --> 34:47.373
- We'll do our best.
- Thank you.

34:54.514 --> 34:56.715
When he thought about dropping
his daughter off at the bar,

34:56.784 --> 34:58.717
he saw her walk past Marker
and another guy.

34:58.786 --> 35:00.787
They were checking her out.

35:00.854 --> 35:02.889
Ok, so she met Marker.

35:02.956 --> 35:04.956
He found out
about her father's work.

35:05.024 --> 35:08.193
He tried to get close to her so he
could get his hands on the bullets.

35:08.261 --> 35:11.163
What about the guy that was with marker?
Do you think he's involved?

35:11.230 --> 35:13.365
They seemed pretty tight,
yeah. We should check him out.

35:13.433 --> 35:16.001
- Sounds like a lead.
- Hm-hm!

35:19.205 --> 35:21.539
So I checked
all of Marker's contacts

35:21.607 --> 35:25.009
up against the description of the
guy Toby saw him with in his read.

35:25.076 --> 35:27.645
And my best bet is
it's this guy...

35:27.713 --> 35:30.448
Bingo! That's the guy.

35:30.516 --> 35:33.451
It's Theo Rechell. He's the head
of one of the fastest-growing

35:33.519 --> 35:36.520
criminal organizations in the
city. And he's been a suspect

35:36.587 --> 35:38.855
in everything from hijackings
to contract killings.

35:38.923 --> 35:40.957
So what does Marker have to do
with Rechell's operation?

35:41.025 --> 35:42.959
Maybe he's moving up
in the world.

35:43.027 --> 35:45.195
Do we know where to find him?
He's got a small

35:45.262 --> 35:48.465
auto body repair shop called
Marvel Auto in the west end.

35:48.533 --> 35:52.468
- That could be where the bullets could be.
- And Amy, you wanna text us the address?

35:52.536 --> 35:54.603
♪

36:04.047 --> 36:06.215
Stay behind me.

36:16.124 --> 36:18.526
IIB!

36:18.594 --> 36:21.529
I guess this isn't about a car?

36:32.403 --> 36:34.337
What do you want?

36:34.405 --> 36:36.272
We're looking for
Theo Rechell.

36:36.340 --> 36:38.775
- He's not here.
- Yeah, but he was.

36:45.315 --> 36:46.492
When did he leave?

36:46.612 --> 36:50.166
Look I don't know what you're looking for.
I just fix the cars.

36:50.286 --> 36:52.187
Ok, well unless you
can tell us where to find him,

36:52.255 --> 36:55.090
you're looking at becoming an accessory
to the murder of an officer.

36:55.158 --> 36:57.025
Whoa, no. That's not right.

36:57.093 --> 36:59.895
<i>What the hell?</i>
<i>I'm not part of this.</i>

36:59.963 --> 37:03.264
Alright, look, maybe you're not a
part of this, but you can help us.

37:03.332 --> 37:05.600
Was there a girl with them?

37:05.668 --> 37:07.902
I saw a girl in the office...

37:07.970 --> 37:10.037
but I don't know who she was.

37:14.777 --> 37:16.743
Where are they?

37:16.811 --> 37:19.045
I don't know. I know Theo
is some kind of dangerous guy.

37:19.113 --> 37:22.683
But I'm not part of any of this.
I just fix the cars.

37:22.750 --> 37:25.085
- How long ago did they leave?
- About an hour ago.

37:32.860 --> 37:35.862
- Was the girl with them?
- I didn't see them leave.

37:35.929 --> 37:39.264
- I promise. That's all I know.
- Alright.

37:40.234 --> 37:42.268
I saw Marker and Rechell
putting stuff into a van.

37:42.336 --> 37:44.705
I think they're gonna
make their next move.

37:44.825 --> 37:45.520
Ok.

37:45.640 --> 37:47.207
Dev, it's me.

37:47.274 --> 37:49.555
Yeah, Marker and his guys are about
to make their next play.

37:49.675 --> 37:51.636
I need you to contact
the armored car company.

37:51.756 --> 37:53.045
We're looking for
a big pickup.

37:53.165 --> 37:54.346
<i>They have about an hour
ahead of us.</i>

37:54.414 --> 37:56.482
Yeah, I already made a listing
of all scheduled pickups

37:56.550 --> 37:58.584
by the major
armored car services.

37:58.652 --> 38:02.054
Looks like Allied had a big interbank
transfer about 20 minutes ago.

38:02.122 --> 38:04.990
<i>There's a cash delivery to a
big box store in the docklands,</i>

38:05.057 --> 38:06.958
<i>But it doesn't look
like it's a very big score.</i>

38:07.026 --> 38:10.194
Let's see... oh! Hold on, that's
the same company as last time,

38:10.262 --> 38:12.196
the Steel Armored Services.
They have a pickup

38:12.264 --> 38:14.666
at the Lionsgate Bank
on the Danforth in an hour.

38:14.734 --> 38:16.668
It's 2 million plus.

38:16.736 --> 38:18.637
<i>They're sending it to
the head office on Bay Street.</i>

38:18.704 --> 38:20.704
Get some units to follow the
truck. We're gonna pick you up

38:20.772 --> 38:23.807
- and run the route ahead of them.
<i>- Got it.</i>

38:32.016 --> 38:33.816
<i>Right. Keep your eyes</i>
<i>on the truck</i>

38:33.884 --> 38:36.685
and hit us back
if you see anything, ok?

38:36.753 --> 38:38.687
Second team's got eyes
on the armored car.

38:38.755 --> 38:40.489
(Michelle): Ok. Any idea
where they're headed next?

38:40.557 --> 38:43.359
Well, it gets busier once
you get into the inner city,

38:43.427 --> 38:45.361
so my guess would be...

38:45.429 --> 38:47.463
somewhere after they turn up
off the Lakeshore.

38:47.531 --> 38:50.433
Ok, we'll keep driving the route to make
sure that it's clear and double back.

38:50.500 --> 38:54.335
Keep us patched in to the driver's feed. If
they see anything, I wanna know about it.

39:10.651 --> 39:13.420
Dev, call the armored car.

39:13.488 --> 39:16.623
Let's rock and roll, kiddies.

39:19.294 --> 39:21.095
What the hell is it doing?

39:21.162 --> 39:23.197
It's a trap!

39:23.264 --> 39:27.066
Police!
Drop your weapons now!

39:27.134 --> 39:29.602
- (Man): Put 'em down! Drop 'em!
- (Man): IIB! Get down, now!

39:29.669 --> 39:31.937
Drop the weapons!

39:36.943 --> 39:39.812
You too.

39:43.616 --> 39:46.218
(Marker): <i>Come on,</i>
<i>get out here.</i>

39:46.285 --> 39:49.154
- Michelle, there's another one.
- Let him go!

39:49.222 --> 39:51.789
- I said, let him go!
- Amy, drop your weapon.

39:51.857 --> 39:54.126
- I'll do it.
- Amy, it's over.

39:54.193 --> 39:56.760
- Toby, get out of the way!
- Put your gun down. Alright?

39:56.828 --> 39:58.762
Everyone can walk away
from this in one piece.

39:58.830 --> 40:01.932
I won't let you take Kurt.
He's all I've got.

40:02.000 --> 40:04.534
- You're all your father's got.
- We're gonna go,

40:04.602 --> 40:06.903
and my dad can go on
with his life.

40:06.971 --> 40:09.539
You don't know, do you?

40:09.607 --> 40:11.374
Kurt tried to kill
your father yesterday.

40:11.442 --> 40:13.309
He wouldn't do that...

40:13.377 --> 40:15.112
- It's true.
- Don't listen to them, Amy.

40:15.179 --> 40:17.447
He's in the hospital.
He's gonna be ok.

40:17.515 --> 40:20.415
But he needs you.

40:20.483 --> 40:24.453
All he talks about
is getting you back, Amy.

40:24.521 --> 40:26.488
Amy, they will shoot you.

40:26.556 --> 40:29.291
Just put your gun down.

40:29.359 --> 40:31.160
This won't solve anything.

40:31.227 --> 40:33.162
Give your dad a chance

40:33.229 --> 40:35.830
to connect with you again.

40:43.873 --> 40:46.074
I'm... I'm sorry.

40:48.510 --> 40:50.045
(Man): Let's go.

40:50.112 --> 40:53.213
- (Woman): Alright.
- (Man): Let's go, move!

40:53.281 --> 40:55.448
(Amy sighing)
(Man): Let me get your hands.

41:03.357 --> 41:05.292
You did good.

41:05.359 --> 41:07.393
How come this doesn't feel
like a win?

41:07.460 --> 41:11.164
(Police sirens) It's not.
No one's a winner here.

41:19.239 --> 41:21.140
How can somebody be warm, dry
and clammy at the same time?

41:21.208 --> 41:23.274
- I don't know.
- Anything can kill him.

41:23.342 --> 41:25.744
- Hey, Toby.
- The suit, every time. I love it.

41:25.812 --> 41:27.846
I saw on the news.
You guys took down the shooters.

41:27.914 --> 41:30.782
Yeah, yeah. Superintendent Martell
is stoked, man. Everyone's happy.

41:30.850 --> 41:32.751
Yeah. She made it sound
like she did it all herself.

41:32.819 --> 41:34.853
- That's her job.
- Whereas you're in it

41:34.921 --> 41:37.222
for the brushes with criminal
lowlifes and homicidal maniacs?

41:37.289 --> 41:39.489
- That's why we're friends.
- Speaking of which,

41:39.557 --> 41:40.674
I'm off at 8 o'clock tonight.

41:40.794 --> 41:42.741
I'm hanging out with Tia.
You and Sandy wanna join us?

41:42.861 --> 41:44.695
- I would love to.
- Great.

41:44.763 --> 41:47.131
- See you then.
- Ok. Good luck in there.

41:49.434 --> 41:51.468
- Did you find her?
- We did.

41:51.536 --> 41:54.838
She's alive.
They hurt her?

41:57.174 --> 42:00.844
It's a little more
complicated than that.

42:02.102 --> 42:05.615
She's gonna need your support.

42:05.682 --> 42:08.985
You've got to understand her.

42:09.053 --> 42:11.820
(Inaudible talking)

42:14.624 --> 42:16.625
