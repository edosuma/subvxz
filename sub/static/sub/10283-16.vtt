00:03.937 --> 00:05.773
Previously on ER:

00:05.773 --> 00:08.442
-What's this?
-That's for you and the little
bastard.

00:08.442 --> 00:10.778
Thanks, Frank.

00:10.778 --> 00:14.582
-I need a total hip replacement.
-Not necessarily.

00:14.582 --> 00:17.451
You've gotta help me, Greg.
I've been trying damn hard.

00:17.451 --> 00:19.187
For me, for K.J.

00:19.187 --> 00:21.422
-What's your name?
-Jose Rodriguez.

00:21.422 --> 00:23.424
Did your drunk ass hit that kid?

00:23.424 --> 00:27.061
The cops brought in a friend a
while ago
for a blood-alcohol level.

00:27.061 --> 00:29.097
I drew my own blood,
switched the tubes.

00:29.097 --> 00:30.598
I made him turn himself in.

00:30.598 --> 00:33.567
You got your friend
to own up to what he did.

00:33.567 --> 00:35.369
Take your own advice.

00:37.000 --> 00:43.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:45.613 --> 00:48.749
Kerry? What are you doing here?

00:48.749 --> 00:51.252
Good morning to you too, Luka.

00:51.252 --> 00:55.489
-Thought I'd come in and lend a
hand.
-On your day off?

00:55.489 --> 00:59.260
Neela's still doing her surgical
elective
and with Clemente on medical
leave--

00:59.260 --> 01:02.796
As department chief,
I felt the circumstances
warranted it.

01:02.796 --> 01:05.233
And I supported your decision,
but in the meantime--

01:05.233 --> 01:08.136
It will be fine.
Go home, spend the day with
Henry.

01:08.136 --> 01:11.672
Henry is spending the day
with Sandy's mom at the science
museum.

01:11.672 --> 01:15.643
-If we get busy, I'll call you,
okay?
-Look, I'm here now.

01:15.643 --> 01:18.746
You are making this up.
Toilet training at six months?

01:18.746 --> 01:22.216
-Hookah bar asthma attack.
-I saved the article. I'll bring
it for you.

01:22.216 --> 01:23.551
Parking meter versus fist.

01:23.551 --> 01:25.886
Sounds like a direct route
to the shrink's couch.

01:25.886 --> 01:28.422
And in Curtain 1,
a severe case of over-golding.

01:28.422 --> 01:30.424
-Over a what-ing?
-Prepare to be amazed.

01:30.424 --> 01:33.494
-Here's a fax from the blood
bank.
-Okay, everybody, listen up.

01:33.494 --> 01:37.565
There's a statewide blood
shortage.
So no extra servings if you can
help it.

01:37.565 --> 01:41.169
Employee blood-drive in the
cafeteria
until 8:00 tonight.

01:41.169 --> 01:43.804
-Got anything for me, chief?
-Oh, yes. For you, anal warts.

01:43.804 --> 01:45.639
Every girl's dream.

01:45.639 --> 01:48.642
-And raw oyster anaphylaxis.
-How can anyone eat those
things?

01:48.642 --> 01:52.313
-They're supposed to be an
aphrodisiac.
-Trust me, they work.

01:52.313 --> 01:56.317
Let's start with the lumbar
disc, followed by
the rotator cuff and then the
ACL.

01:56.317 --> 01:59.487
Dr. Weaver, you're early.
Your surgery's not until this
afternoon.

01:59.487 --> 02:02.190
Yeah, I know. I'm sorry. I have
to cancel.

02:02.190 --> 02:04.558
ER's getting slammed
and they begged me to come in.

02:04.558 --> 02:06.294
And the dog ate your homework.

02:06.294 --> 02:09.263
-I've heard this before. Twice.
-I know that I've canceled.

02:09.263 --> 02:12.333
-But it's just not a good time.
-You can't keep doing this.

02:12.333 --> 02:15.569
You should realize the havoc
you're wreaking with my
schedule.

02:15.569 --> 02:18.639
-You need this operation.
-Dr. Kline, can we talk in here?

02:25.246 --> 02:27.915
You have end-stage arthrosis,
advanced degeneration...

02:27.915 --> 02:30.751
...with a piece of cartilage
that's flapping in the breeze.

02:30.751 --> 02:33.321
I will take care of it soon.

02:33.321 --> 02:36.857
Look, I realize that the
prospect of surgery
can be scary, even for doctors.

02:36.857 --> 02:39.860
-It's not that. It's just that
I--
-Just what, Kerry?

02:39.860 --> 02:41.429
You're in pain.

02:44.298 --> 02:47.901
I'm sorry about your schedule,
but the ER comes first.

02:47.901 --> 02:50.504
Fine, but I don't get it.

02:50.504 --> 02:54.775
If I were you, I would be dying
to throw that crutch away once
and for all.

03:49.363 --> 03:53.367
-All I'm saying is you got to
accessorize.
-And I can see that, Mr.
Lemoyne...

03:53.367 --> 03:56.870
...but your rings and bracelets
are cutting off your
circulation.

03:56.870 --> 03:59.707
Is that why my neck hurts?

03:59.707 --> 04:01.008
Let's see.

04:07.315 --> 04:09.417
Your chains--

04:09.417 --> 04:12.820
--have eroded into your skin.
It looks infected.

04:12.820 --> 04:15.723
-So you're gonna give me some
medicine?
-Yeah.

04:15.723 --> 04:19.627
But infection can't get better
unless you remove your jewelry.

04:19.627 --> 04:21.462
Oh, no, I never take it off.

04:21.462 --> 04:26.367
I eat with it, sleep with it
and bathe with it on.

04:26.367 --> 04:31.339
Let's see. Does it ever get in
the way
of, say, airport security?

04:31.339 --> 04:32.940
Oh, no. I don't fly.

04:34.942 --> 04:37.678
Well, when you're having....

04:40.013 --> 04:42.916
-When you're--
-Oh, the ladies love the bling.

04:44.385 --> 04:45.753
I hear you, man.

04:47.621 --> 04:50.057
All right, who left a kielbasa
in the drug fridge?

04:50.057 --> 04:52.726
This is a clear JCAHO violation.
Who didn't know that?

04:52.726 --> 04:56.564
-I'm guessing Frank. His name's
on it.
-Tell him to keep his sausage to
himself.

04:59.933 --> 05:01.769
-Do you wanna see something?
-What?

05:03.504 --> 05:05.373
My 3-D sonogram. I just got it.

05:07.074 --> 05:10.043
So that's his, or her,
I guess, first baby picture.

05:12.546 --> 05:15.583
You okay? Kerry?

05:15.583 --> 05:17.385
Yeah, I'm--

05:17.385 --> 05:19.987
So you....

05:19.987 --> 05:22.956
-You didn't find out what the
sex is?
-No.

05:22.956 --> 05:25.593
Luka wanted to,
but I'm old-fashioned, I guess.

05:25.593 --> 05:28.862
Well, there aren't too many true
surprises
left in life, are there?

05:28.862 --> 05:32.400
No, and it doesn't matter
as long as it's healthy, right?

05:32.400 --> 05:34.502
Right. So how are you feeling?

05:34.502 --> 05:36.504
Very good. Very energetic,
actually.

05:36.504 --> 05:39.039
That's how Sandy was.
She loved the second trimester.

05:39.039 --> 05:41.809
The nausea was gone,
she could eat whatever she
wanted.

05:41.809 --> 05:45.012
Dr. Weaver, auto versus peds,
multiples a minute out.

05:45.012 --> 05:47.415
Ray and Morris are already
outside.

05:47.415 --> 05:50.117
-Be right there.
-Are you sure you want me to get
you--?

05:50.117 --> 05:52.720
No, I'm fine.
Make sure you get that framed.

06:04.865 --> 06:06.800
Rasgotra, perfect timing.
We may need a consult.

06:06.800 --> 06:09.136
-That's a big lunch.
-They're cookies.

06:09.136 --> 06:12.973
I've got an Army Spouse Club
meeting
tonight. I'd rather watch World
Poker Tour.

06:12.973 --> 06:15.443
-You baked?
-Everyone has to bring
something.

06:15.443 --> 06:18.145
-You gonna show some love?
-The ER vultures can taste test.

06:18.145 --> 06:20.681
All right, one cookie per
person.
I'll see you inside.

06:20.681 --> 06:22.816
Okay, fellas, heads up. Let's
go.

06:22.816 --> 06:26.487
Donna Gallagher, unrestrained
teen driver,
ejected when her car flipped.

06:26.487 --> 06:28.722
Hit a jogger, coming in on the
next rig.
GCS seven. BP 90 palp.

06:28.722 --> 06:30.858
Ray, Trauma 1.

06:30.858 --> 06:34.495
Passenger has facial injuries
from air bag
and shoulder pain, vitals
stable.

06:34.495 --> 06:35.896
-Abby, sutures.
-Got it.

06:35.896 --> 06:37.931
-What's your name, sweetie?
-Katherine Odachowski.

06:37.931 --> 06:40.868
I feel you.
I used to be Abigail Wyczenski.

06:40.868 --> 06:43.103
My friends call me Katie-O.

06:43.103 --> 06:46.774
-Donna, can you hear me?
-BP 75 systolic, pulse 130.

06:46.774 --> 06:49.810
-How are we doing in here?
-Nothing in the belly, no
tamponade.

06:49.810 --> 06:52.079
Why she hypotensive?

06:52.079 --> 06:53.581
Ecchymosis on the thighs.

06:53.581 --> 06:56.183
-Distal extremities too.
-She's in DIC.

06:56.183 --> 07:00.053
-She has to be hemorrhaging
somewhere.
-All right, let's get her to the
scanner.

07:00.053 --> 07:01.922
Her IV sites are oozing.

07:01.922 --> 07:05.058
-She needs platelets and FFP.
-No, not with this blood
shortage.

07:05.058 --> 07:07.227
We can't give her our last
platelets.

07:07.227 --> 07:08.862
She's unresponsive, bleeding...

07:08.862 --> 07:11.565
-...could have a head bleed.
-We don't know that.

07:11.565 --> 07:14.067
-Get me a gram of acetaminophen.
-Why else would she be
unconscious?

07:14.067 --> 07:17.070
-Acetaminophen?
-For me. Tablets, please.

07:17.070 --> 07:20.007
Secure her airway.
Let's see what we find on CT.

07:20.007 --> 07:22.175
By then it could be too late.

07:24.612 --> 07:27.581
Okay, Katie, move your head
from side to side.

07:28.148 --> 07:29.249
Does that hurt?

07:29.249 --> 07:30.150
-It's just a little stiff.
-Okay.

07:30.150 --> 07:32.520
And I hurt all over.

07:32.520 --> 07:36.223
-And your forearms are bruised
though.
-I must have hit them on the
dashboard.

07:36.223 --> 07:38.959
Now, do you remember what
happened?

07:38.959 --> 07:42.229
-We were at the mall.
-No school?

07:42.229 --> 07:45.533
It was the last day before
spring break,
so we cut.

07:45.533 --> 07:48.068
But Donna got a headache
and she said she wanted to go
home.

07:48.068 --> 07:50.704
Okay. Okay, follow my finger.

07:53.140 --> 07:54.675
The light really hurts.

07:56.143 --> 07:58.546
The air bag could have
scratched your cornea.

07:58.546 --> 08:00.881
BP 115 over 80, pulse 104.

08:00.881 --> 08:03.684
I'm gonna press on your abdomen,
let me know if it hurts.

08:03.684 --> 08:07.755
She fainted on the way home.
I tried to stop the car, but I
couldn't.

08:07.755 --> 08:11.291
Chest x-ray, shoulder series,
ICON, UA and visual acuity.

08:11.291 --> 08:14.061
-I'll set up the slit lamp.
-Thank you.

08:14.061 --> 08:15.996
And then the car was upside
down.

08:15.996 --> 08:19.567
I looked over at Donna,
but she wasn't there anymore.

08:19.567 --> 08:22.035
It's okay.

08:22.035 --> 08:23.737
Abdomen's tender.

08:23.737 --> 08:26.640
-Morphine, five migs.
-CBC, chemistry, coags and
Foley.

08:26.640 --> 08:30.578
-This is what I get for trying
to be healthy.
-Thigh deformity, right femur
films.

08:30.578 --> 08:32.613
C-spine, chest and pelvis. Sager
Splint.

08:32.613 --> 08:35.582
This morning, I started a new
diet
and went out for a jog--

08:35.582 --> 08:39.587
-BP's 94 over 40, pulse 140.
-Second liter of saline wide
open.

08:39.587 --> 08:42.655
--when, bam, this car drives
into
the sidewalk and hits me.

08:42.655 --> 08:44.758
-Pedal pulse intact.
-Blood in Morrison's.

08:44.758 --> 08:47.227
Two liters in. BP still 85.

08:47.227 --> 08:50.798
Mr. Highsmith, you're bleeding
internally.
You'll need surgery to stop it.

08:50.798 --> 08:53.066
Just wait until I get
my hands on that driver.

08:53.066 --> 08:56.604
-Type and cross four units and
call the OR.
-I'll look in next door.

08:56.604 --> 09:00.608
Okay, check on Kerry while
you're there.
See if she needs any help.

09:00.608 --> 09:03.611
-Sats 88 and dropping.
-Laryngospasm, can't pass the
tube.

09:03.611 --> 09:04.612
Need surgery consult?

09:04.612 --> 09:05.679
-Not yet.
-Yes.

09:05.679 --> 09:08.616
Well, page me if anything
changes.

09:08.616 --> 09:10.050
-Need sux.
-Got it.

09:11.652 --> 09:14.855
-You okay in here otherwise?
-Yeah, why?

09:14.855 --> 09:16.857
Dr. Kovac just asked me to make
sure.

09:17.658 --> 09:19.627
We're fine.

09:38.712 --> 09:41.381
-Okay, go ahead, Sam.
-She's bradying down.

09:41.381 --> 09:43.717
-Sats 82.
-Okay.

09:44.317 --> 09:47.354
Trying again.

09:47.354 --> 09:51.058
Neela, I need you to see
somebody in 3.
And you're not gonna believe
this.

09:51.058 --> 09:53.193
Hypotensive femur fracture
and ortho's MIA.

09:53.193 --> 09:55.228
Three more minutes
before I call your chief.

09:57.230 --> 10:00.367
The guy's a professional
regurgitator.
He swallowed a light bulb.

10:00.367 --> 10:02.836
It's stuck in the duodenum,
so he needs the OR.

10:02.836 --> 10:06.874
That's weird, but I can't help.
I've got a triple trauma, page
Albright.

10:06.874 --> 10:10.177
You hear the good news?
Jose Rodriguez, they're
releasing him today.

10:10.177 --> 10:14.147
Not anymore. He's got a wound
infection.
He'll need another week of IV
antibiotics.

10:14.147 --> 10:17.417
I assume things went well with
Kovac
when you told him what you did.

10:17.417 --> 10:19.419
-You are still here.
-Right, yeah.

10:19.419 --> 10:22.723
-Neela, I got the x-ray on our
jogger.
-Okay, I gotta go.

10:29.262 --> 10:32.966
-Did you reach my parents?
-They're on their way in, so are
Donna's.

10:32.966 --> 10:34.668
Is she okay?

10:34.668 --> 10:37.137
She's got some really good
doctors
taking care of her.

10:38.839 --> 10:41.174
-Can I get something for my
headache?
-Sure.

10:41.174 --> 10:43.310
Temp is up, 101.8.

10:43.310 --> 10:47.715
Okay, 600 of ibuprofen.

10:47.715 --> 10:50.718
And about my bruises,
when will they go away?

10:52.252 --> 10:55.188
They've spread.

10:55.188 --> 10:56.790
Yeah.

11:04.031 --> 11:08.736
-Abby?
-Okay. Chuny, put on a mask.

11:08.736 --> 11:12.272
Call the lab for stat blood
cultures,
hang two grams of ceftriaxone on
IV.

11:12.272 --> 11:13.974
Make sure she stays in
isolation.

11:13.974 --> 11:16.209
Don't worry, you'll be jogging
in no time.

11:16.209 --> 11:18.411
Luka.

11:18.411 --> 11:21.014
-Time of death, 12:17.
-It's meningococcemia.

11:21.014 --> 11:23.250
Are you sure?

11:23.250 --> 11:27.220
My patient has rapidly
progressing purpura
and fever and I bet this one
does too.

11:27.220 --> 11:29.356
-It was DIC from trauma.
-I don't think so.

11:29.356 --> 11:32.760
My girl complained of headaches,
stiff neck and sensitivity to
light.

11:32.760 --> 11:34.294
I'll call Infection Control.

11:34.294 --> 11:36.496
I put her in isolation.

11:36.496 --> 11:40.801
We need immediate prophylaxis
for all
hospital staff exposed to these
patients.

11:40.801 --> 11:43.336
-That's a lot of people.
-We're all at risk.

11:49.977 --> 11:52.379
When can we go in?
I wanna be with my daughter.

11:52.379 --> 11:54.214
Not until we get her up to the
ICU.

11:54.214 --> 11:56.850
-When will that be?
-We're still waiting for a bed.

11:56.850 --> 11:58.251
I don't understand.

11:58.251 --> 12:00.854
How did the girls get this?
Who else was exposed?

12:00.854 --> 12:02.790
Public Health will need to
figure that out.

12:02.790 --> 12:04.224
We have two other children.

12:04.224 --> 12:06.794
They need to be treated
immediately
and you do too.

12:06.794 --> 12:09.797
Chuny, let's make sure
that Katie's parents are
treated...

12:09.797 --> 12:11.799
...and then show them
to the family room.

12:11.799 --> 12:14.067
I'll get you as soon as
we send Katie upstairs.

12:14.067 --> 12:17.337
This is County General,
the parents of Michelle Sutton
called.

12:17.337 --> 12:19.039
Here you go, Frank.

12:19.039 --> 12:21.809
I better not get this.
I can't even pronounce it.

12:21.809 --> 12:24.845
We're halfway through the
student list
from the girls' school.

12:24.845 --> 12:26.379
-Morris.
-How are we doing on Cipro?

12:26.379 --> 12:28.515
Mercy's sending 150 doses.

12:28.515 --> 12:32.085
The pharmacy called the
distributor.
They're sending more within the
hour.

12:32.085 --> 12:34.822
-Here you go.
-Can't take that, it's
contraindicated.

12:34.822 --> 12:36.824
I didn't know that.
I'll find you some--

12:36.824 --> 12:38.826
That's all right. I'm on it.

12:38.826 --> 12:41.261
-Did you take your Cipro?
-Yes, did you get your shot?

12:41.261 --> 12:43.563
No, I'm researching
alternatives right now.

12:43.563 --> 12:46.333
-You should just get a
ceftriaxone--
-I wanna make sure.

12:46.333 --> 12:48.969
-It's safe for you and the baby.
-You can't know that.

12:48.969 --> 12:52.239
-It's category B, not category
A.
-Abby, there is no category A.

12:52.239 --> 12:54.241
Nobody does controlled trials
on pregnant--

12:54.241 --> 12:57.144
"In most cases ceftriaxone
is probably safe." Probably.

12:57.144 --> 12:59.980
-I'll give you the shot myself.
-You're fine with probably?

12:59.980 --> 13:01.248
Thank you, Mrs. Riley.

13:13.994 --> 13:15.863
Hey, Jose. How's it going, man?

13:18.198 --> 13:21.568
-What are you watching?
-Rock 'n' Roll Soldiers.

13:21.568 --> 13:23.136
Oh, yeah? Any good?

13:23.136 --> 13:25.238
Yeah, it's cool.

13:27.140 --> 13:29.910
Did you hit your head
when you passed out, Mr. Elliot?

13:29.910 --> 13:31.511
I don't think so.

13:31.511 --> 13:33.613
But then again,
I was unconscious at the time.

13:33.613 --> 13:36.884
He slumped over in the back
seat,
but he was wearing his seatbelt.

13:36.884 --> 13:38.385
Malik, a little help?

13:38.385 --> 13:41.554
What are you giving away,
free toasters here or something?

13:43.323 --> 13:46.894
Conjunctiva are pale. Tachy at
120.

13:48.228 --> 13:50.063
I'll order an EKG.

13:50.063 --> 13:51.932
Any history of heart problems?

13:51.932 --> 13:53.901
No, my heart's fine.

13:53.901 --> 13:56.970
Hello. Yeah.
Let me call you back, all right?

13:56.970 --> 14:02.910
Give me 10 minutes. Yeah.

14:02.910 --> 14:04.945
Okay, your spleen is enlarged,
so--

14:04.945 --> 14:07.981
No, not my spleen--
Look, I'm sorry, Morris.

14:07.981 --> 14:10.283
Thanks for your thoroughness,
but I don't need tests.

14:10.283 --> 14:13.386
I just prefer my driver--
John, just take me home now.

14:13.386 --> 14:15.522
I'd prefer your driver take me
home too...

14:15.522 --> 14:18.425
...but we have to stay
and find out why you passed out.

14:18.425 --> 14:21.228
-And you are?
-Sam Taggart.

14:21.228 --> 14:25.132
Well, Ms. Taggart, I'm anemic
from MDS.

14:25.132 --> 14:28.035
-MDS?
-Myelodysplastic syndrome.

14:28.035 --> 14:30.670
His bone marrow
doesn't like making red blood
cells.

14:30.670 --> 14:32.305
-Exactly.
-What type do you have?

14:32.305 --> 14:35.008
Just the kind that requires
frequent transfusions.

14:35.008 --> 14:37.210
Iron chelation therapy five
nights a week.

14:37.210 --> 14:42.950
Will the owner of the ginormous
SUV
parked outside please move said
vehicle.

14:42.950 --> 14:46.419
You're blocking the ambulance
bay.
You will be towed.

14:46.419 --> 14:49.022
John, I believe that's us.
Let's get out of here.

14:49.022 --> 14:50.690
Wait, I have to advise you not
to leave.

14:50.690 --> 14:53.193
You could pass out,
you could have a heart attack.

14:53.193 --> 14:55.128
Yeah, I appreciate....

14:57.397 --> 15:02.002
I got it. Why don't you let us
get
two units into you, okay?

15:02.002 --> 15:04.271
You're here, might as well
let us top off your tank.

15:04.271 --> 15:07.374
-Top off my tank?
-Yeah.

15:07.374 --> 15:10.610
All right. John, move the car.
Take a long lunch.

15:10.610 --> 15:13.013
I'll call you when I'm ready.

15:13.013 --> 15:17.584
Sam, CBC, retic, type and cross
for four
and see if there's an open bed
in Exam 3.

15:21.554 --> 15:24.257
Where do you normally get
your transfusions?

15:24.257 --> 15:28.061
Home. I keep a blood supply
there.

15:28.061 --> 15:31.264
-Really? Where do you get it?
-EBay.

15:37.437 --> 15:40.340
-Work on your injection
technique.
-Come on, it didn't hurt.

15:40.340 --> 15:42.309
I wish I didn't have to take
anything.

15:42.309 --> 15:45.412
Don't let your mind go there.
It'll stress you out.

15:45.412 --> 15:47.014
I'm already stressed.

15:47.014 --> 15:48.348
I'll buy you a hot chocolate.

15:48.348 --> 15:49.749
I don't want a hot chocolate.

15:49.749 --> 15:52.585
-What I wanna do is worry about
the baby.
-What?

15:52.585 --> 15:54.187
Don't reassure me.

15:54.187 --> 15:56.256
Don't tell me everything's fine.
Don't--

15:56.256 --> 15:59.726
-Buy you hot chocolate?
-I'm serious.

15:59.726 --> 16:02.729
Don't you think I'd be concerned
if there's any chance...

16:02.729 --> 16:06.099
-...that something bad could
happen?
-So, what? Now I'm the crazy
one?

16:06.099 --> 16:08.668
-I didn't say that. We're in
this together.
-Really?

16:08.668 --> 16:10.037
-Yeah, 100 percent.
-Really?

16:10.037 --> 16:13.173
Well, it feels more like 60-40
to me.

16:17.377 --> 16:21.248
Well, sometimes I'm completely
terrified.

16:21.248 --> 16:26.586
And I just need to worry about
it every now
and then and I need you to let
me do that.

16:28.255 --> 16:31.491
Would it help if I worried along
with you?

16:34.794 --> 16:36.463
We could try that, yeah.

16:41.468 --> 16:44.271
-How long should we worry?
-Ten or 20 minutes.

16:47.107 --> 16:49.442
-Can I have two hot chocolates,
please?
-Okay.

16:53.080 --> 16:56.383
Hold still now, Mr. Lemoyne.

16:56.383 --> 16:59.652
-Do you have a patient
belongings bag?
-Sure.

16:59.652 --> 17:01.821
Pizza?
I didn't know there was a
collection.

17:01.821 --> 17:03.823
-Yeah, your money's no good
here.
-It's on Kovac.

17:03.823 --> 17:05.657
All right, I'll take two.

17:05.657 --> 17:08.728
His way of saying, sorry you
were exposed
to a deadly bacteria.

17:08.728 --> 17:11.798
Please ask for Dr. Archie Morris
when you call back. Thank you.

17:11.798 --> 17:14.367
-Hey, how'd it go with our
jogger?
-He's in recovery.

17:14.367 --> 17:16.236
He should be fine, but I'm a
pariah.

17:16.236 --> 17:19.205
Everyone in Surgery
has to take Cipro because of me.

17:19.205 --> 17:22.108
Frank, you're supposed to be
the keeper of my cookies.

17:22.108 --> 17:25.112
Leaving them out anyone could
take
as many as they wanted.

17:25.112 --> 17:26.445
Probably all gone by now--

17:28.815 --> 17:31.651
Has anyone tasted them?

17:31.651 --> 17:34.221
Reviews are still coming in.

17:34.221 --> 17:38.758
-Morris, have you tried my
cookies?
-No, but I would love to try
your cookies...

17:38.758 --> 17:41.461
...as soon as I'm done with
lunch.

17:41.461 --> 17:42.862
I'll save this for later.

17:42.862 --> 17:45.165
-Do you have a second?
-Yeah, sure.

17:45.165 --> 17:47.667
Kovac, thanks for the pizza,
man.

17:47.667 --> 17:49.136
Enjoy it, Malik.

17:49.136 --> 17:51.138
Frank, what was all that about?

17:51.138 --> 17:58.845
If you don't want a three-day
bellyache,
lose the cookie.

17:58.845 --> 18:01.314
How late is your Spouse Club
meeting
going tonight?

18:01.314 --> 18:02.749
Eight or 9. Why?

18:02.749 --> 18:05.218
I made a date with this hot girl
named Ashley.

18:05.218 --> 18:08.221
-She's really hard to pin down.
-And I should care because?

18:08.221 --> 18:11.158
I invited her to the apartment.
I'm making penne a la Barnett.

18:11.158 --> 18:13.226
Great, Ray. I'm absolutely
knackered.

18:13.226 --> 18:16.596
All I wanna do after this
meeting
is go straight home and watch
TV.

18:16.596 --> 18:19.899
-Please, Neela, I really like
this girl.
-You like them all.

18:19.899 --> 18:22.702
I owe you.

18:22.702 --> 18:25.372
-What's up?
-I just made Ray happy.

18:25.372 --> 18:27.274
You're such a giver.

18:27.274 --> 18:29.909
-You wanna have dinner with me
tonight?
-I can't tonight.

18:29.909 --> 18:33.213
Too bad. I was looking forward
to sharing a meal with
someone...

18:33.213 --> 18:35.615
...who doesn't calculate
every ounce of protein I eat.

18:35.615 --> 18:37.850
Is Luka being a little
overprotective?

18:37.850 --> 18:41.821
He doesn't understand that
sometimes
the baby wants a hot fudge
sundae at night.

18:41.821 --> 18:45.425
So I have some themes in mind
for your baby shower.

18:45.425 --> 18:47.194
Themes?

18:47.194 --> 18:49.862
I'm not sure I'm really
the baby shower kind of person.

18:49.862 --> 18:52.265
We could have a tea party
with a garden theme...

18:52.265 --> 18:54.667
...or a diaper party
or a books-for-baby party.

18:54.667 --> 18:57.304
Isn't it a little early
to be talking about this?

18:57.304 --> 18:58.671
Maybe you want a co-ed shower?

18:58.671 --> 19:01.241
Before you know it,
the baby's gonna be here.

19:01.241 --> 19:03.776
-And my life, as I know it, will
be over.
-In a good way.

19:03.776 --> 19:05.578
In a good way.

19:05.578 --> 19:07.914
We can talk about showers next
week...

19:07.914 --> 19:12.219
...but I'm telling you now, I'm
not wearing
a paper plate hat with ribbons
on it.

19:33.973 --> 19:36.476
Looks like fun, can anybody
play?

19:36.476 --> 19:38.511
I was just....

19:39.846 --> 19:41.281
Practicing.

19:43.516 --> 19:45.918
I dropped a syringe today
and I couldn't pick it up.

19:46.986 --> 19:48.721
Your hip?

19:48.721 --> 19:52.592
It is a pain, literally and
figuratively.

19:54.894 --> 19:57.997
Thanks.

19:57.997 --> 20:02.369
Have you given up on the idea
of replacement surgery?

20:02.369 --> 20:05.338
Three times now, including
today.

20:05.338 --> 20:09.509
-Today?
-I cancelled.

20:09.509 --> 20:12.345
It's not a good time to be off
my feet.
The ER needs me...

20:12.345 --> 20:15.848
...and what mobility I do have
I need for Henry, because he's--

20:15.848 --> 20:17.684
All he wants to...

20:20.653 --> 20:26.293
...do these days is drive
this little hot rod that I got
him.

20:26.293 --> 20:28.261
He steers and I push.

20:31.364 --> 20:34.601
Well, Henry's only gonna get
older and more active.

20:34.601 --> 20:36.769
Are you afraid of the surgery?

20:39.506 --> 20:41.908
Sorry, need the room.
Kovac just got an assault
victim.

20:48.047 --> 20:50.383
Buy you a free cup of coffee?

20:50.383 --> 20:52.385
That's-- That's very generous.

20:52.385 --> 20:55.355
James Bucci, 21,
blunt trauma to head and chest.

20:55.355 --> 20:59.359
Pulse in the 80s,
resps 18, BP 160 over 95.

20:59.359 --> 21:00.960
Okay, ready?

21:00.960 --> 21:02.929
One, two, three.

21:02.929 --> 21:04.697
Get Pratt.

21:04.697 --> 21:08.335
-I'm Dr. Kovac, what's your
name?
-Go, Huskies.

21:08.335 --> 21:10.903
Disoriented to place and time,
but he's had a few.

21:10.903 --> 21:12.439
Okay, how'd this happen?

21:12.439 --> 21:14.407
Got punched by another
basketball fan.

21:14.407 --> 21:18.378
-You know, March Madness.
-More like March stupid.

21:18.378 --> 21:21.080
You gotta get out of the way.
Come on, this is not a
playground.

21:21.080 --> 21:22.815
Be gentle.

21:24.351 --> 21:26.519
-What do we got?
-Bar fight, head trauma...

21:26.519 --> 21:29.356
...alert on arrival but bradied
down,
hypoventilating.

21:29.356 --> 21:31.391
-Sats only 79.
-Okay, he needs a tube.

21:31.391 --> 21:34.361
Eight-O and a Miller two.
What's with the Three Stooges?

21:34.361 --> 21:36.396
I'd say they can't hold their
liquor.

21:36.396 --> 21:38.598
BP's 210 over 100,
heart rate's down in the 50s.

21:38.598 --> 21:40.099
It's herniating.

21:40.099 --> 21:43.035
Okay, 50 of mannitol
and hurry with that tube, Pratt.

21:43.035 --> 21:45.104
-You guys need to wait outside.
-Suction.

21:45.104 --> 21:49.041
-It was just-- It was a stupid
bar fight.
-They usually are.

21:49.041 --> 21:53.546
It was nothing. The bartender
called 911.
Probably was scared he'd get his
ass sued.

21:53.546 --> 21:55.114
Knock it off. Knock it off!

21:55.114 --> 21:57.116
He's gonna be all right though,
right?

21:57.116 --> 22:00.387
Call CT and tell them we'll
be there soon as we get an
airway.

22:00.387 --> 22:02.021
All right, I'm in. Bag him.

22:10.630 --> 22:13.433
You're very good.
I didn't even feel the needle.

22:13.433 --> 22:16.068
Fastest stick north of the
Mason-Dixon.

22:17.837 --> 22:21.107
Hey, how are you feeling?

22:21.107 --> 22:22.875
Pizza really hit the spot.

22:22.875 --> 22:26.446
Well, I figured you for a
deep-dish guy.

22:26.446 --> 22:28.548
Has this Dr. Morris heard back
from my primary?

22:28.548 --> 22:31.083
You know, I am not sure. Hold
on.

22:35.422 --> 22:38.825
Hey, Frank, can you tell Morris
I got a repeat on his 12-lead...

22:38.825 --> 22:41.594
...and can I get a troponin to
the lab?

22:41.594 --> 22:44.531
Yeah, and do you know
if Mr. Elliot's doctor--?

22:44.531 --> 22:48.468
-Robert Gorman.
-A Dr. Gorman has called back
yet?

22:48.468 --> 22:50.537
Okay, thanks.

22:51.471 --> 22:54.474
Nope.

22:54.474 --> 22:58.478
Tell me why I'm paying 20,000 a
year
on personalized medical care.

22:58.478 --> 23:00.880
I can't even get it in an
emergency.

23:00.880 --> 23:02.849
Twenty thousand dollars?

23:02.849 --> 23:06.152
Well, Gorman's a boutique
doctor.

23:06.152 --> 23:10.723
Yeah, well, if there's any such
thing
as a boutique nurse, sign me up.

23:10.723 --> 23:13.493
-Listen, Ms. Taggart--
-Sam.

23:13.493 --> 23:16.696
-For Samantha.
-Samantha, huh?

23:16.696 --> 23:20.800
If life were fair, you nurses
and cops,
firemen and teachers...

23:20.800 --> 23:24.604
...you'd all be paid like
baseball players and movie
stars.

23:24.604 --> 23:26.539
I like the way you think.

23:28.508 --> 23:30.743
Hey, you know,
if you don't mind my asking...

23:30.743 --> 23:32.845
...what is it that you do?

23:32.845 --> 23:34.914
We manage hedge funds.

23:34.914 --> 23:39.686
I started out in imports and
exports,
that kind of thing.

23:39.686 --> 23:42.489
-What are we doing here?
-You're cold.

23:44.891 --> 23:48.060
All right,
I will check back in on you in a
bit.

23:51.798 --> 23:54.200
-V-tach, lost the pulse.
-Starting compressions.

23:54.200 --> 23:55.968
-What's wrong?
-Charge to 200.

23:55.968 --> 23:59.205
-Ready with lido.
-His heart went into an abnormal
rhythm.

23:59.205 --> 24:00.573
Clear.

24:02.208 --> 24:04.544
Charging to 300.

24:04.544 --> 24:07.514
-Man, I can't believe this is
happening.
-Drop it, Phil.

24:07.514 --> 24:09.782
-One of you needs to call his
parents.
-Clear.

24:12.885 --> 24:14.687
Sinus, he's back.

24:14.687 --> 24:17.557
-I think I'm gonna hurl.
-Nope, not in here you're not.

24:17.557 --> 24:19.526
Come on, guys. Let's go.
Out. Out, damn it.

24:19.526 --> 24:22.128
Okay, let's get him to CT
before he codes again.

24:22.128 --> 24:23.863
What's the matter with you guys?

24:23.863 --> 24:26.666
Your friend's sick
and you act like jackasses, huh?
Go.

24:26.666 --> 24:29.636
Hey, make sure these guys
stay in the waiting room.

24:29.636 --> 24:33.706
Man, we're not always like that,
all right?
We've been friends since we were
little.

24:33.706 --> 24:36.242
Do yourself a favor
and get some new friends, okay?

24:36.242 --> 24:39.078
Hey, look. Look, man.

24:40.747 --> 24:43.282
I did it.

24:43.282 --> 24:46.653
You know, Jimmy kept riding me
about our team...

24:46.653 --> 24:49.889
...how we had no inside game,
he was getting up in my face...

24:49.889 --> 24:52.559
...and I punched him.

24:52.559 --> 24:55.061
Well, friends get into it
sometimes.

25:03.002 --> 25:05.972
I lost it, man.

25:05.972 --> 25:07.907
You know, it was just--

25:07.907 --> 25:12.144
It was a split second
and he fell and he hit his head
on the table.

25:12.144 --> 25:14.146
You didn't mean it.

25:14.146 --> 25:17.684
Now, believe me,
everybody's done something in
the past...

25:17.684 --> 25:19.786
...that they wish they could
take back.

25:24.090 --> 25:29.729
Look, I should call his parents,
you know,
and let them know what's going
on.

25:29.729 --> 25:31.197
All right.

25:37.870 --> 25:40.640
What do you see when you look at
me?

25:40.640 --> 25:42.942
-What?
-How would you--?

25:42.942 --> 25:45.945
-How would you describe me?
-I don't know.

25:50.683 --> 25:53.319
Okay, you're a woman.

25:54.286 --> 25:56.288
Doctor, mother.

25:57.790 --> 26:00.326
-A friend.
-Thank you.

26:01.961 --> 26:03.696
You're pretty.

26:07.199 --> 26:09.035
Red-head, nice dresser--

26:09.035 --> 26:11.738
-I'm a disabled person.
-Well, that's not how I see you.

26:11.738 --> 26:13.339
Why not? Why?

26:13.339 --> 26:15.174
It's-- It's-- It's who I am.

26:15.174 --> 26:17.309
It's who I've always been.

26:17.309 --> 26:19.145
That's how I grew up.

26:19.145 --> 26:22.248
It's how I see myself.

26:22.248 --> 26:26.919
I have never considered myself
handicapped or broken.

26:26.919 --> 26:29.321
I don't need to be fixed.

26:29.321 --> 26:32.024
If it weren't for this pain and
the--

26:32.024 --> 26:36.328
The limits that I am facing at
work and...

26:36.328 --> 26:41.000
...trying to take care of my
son,
I'd never even consider getting
a new hip.

26:43.803 --> 26:45.204
I don't....

26:46.839 --> 26:51.010
This surgery is gonna take away
my crutch forever.

26:53.345 --> 26:56.282
And everyone says that's so
great.

26:56.282 --> 26:59.852
But what else will I be giving
up?

26:59.852 --> 27:01.788
Who will I be then?

27:04.023 --> 27:07.960
Okay, you should be good for
another
two weeks before your next
transfusion.

27:07.960 --> 27:10.229
And, I'm sorry,
your primary never called back.

27:10.229 --> 27:12.031
Don't worry about it.

27:12.031 --> 27:13.800
Thank you for your help.

27:13.800 --> 27:16.736
Anytime.

27:16.736 --> 27:20.339
I'll let you in on a secret.
I fired Dr. Gorman an hour ago.

27:20.339 --> 27:23.242
Well, that'll teach
his non-responding boutique
butt.

27:23.242 --> 27:24.877
Hey, Sam.

27:25.712 --> 27:27.714
Alex, what happened?

27:27.714 --> 27:29.348
-I got jacked.
-What?

27:29.348 --> 27:32.218
A couple of older kids beat me
up
walking home.

27:32.218 --> 27:33.720
Does it hurt much?

27:33.720 --> 27:36.155
No, but they stole my cell
phone.

27:36.155 --> 27:39.091
That's okay, don't worry about
that.

27:39.091 --> 27:41.894
Hey, Chuny,
will you take him to Curtain 4?

27:41.894 --> 27:44.764
I get off in 15 minutes.
We'll leave then, okay?

27:44.764 --> 27:47.433
-Okay.
-Come on, Alex, I'll get you an
ice pack.

27:50.302 --> 27:53.906
That's my kid, Alex.

27:53.906 --> 27:57.409
Sounds like you and your husband
will be moving to a nicer
neighborhood now.

27:57.409 --> 27:59.345
It's just me and Alex.

27:59.345 --> 28:02.348
And on a nurse's salary,
where we live is a nice
neighborhood.

28:02.348 --> 28:06.218
It must be hard raising a child
on your own like that, huh?

28:06.218 --> 28:07.987
He's a good kid.

28:10.056 --> 28:11.357
Okay, all done.

28:11.357 --> 28:14.126
Someone will be here shortly
to wheel you out.

28:14.126 --> 28:16.462
-I'd rather walk.
-Yeah, hospital policy says
you--

28:16.462 --> 28:19.298
Do I look like I need a
wheelchair to you?

28:21.267 --> 28:23.135
Ladies first.

28:28.307 --> 28:30.509
I have two sons...

28:30.509 --> 28:32.511
...and a daughter.

28:32.511 --> 28:35.882
Denny and David are out west
now...

28:35.882 --> 28:39.418
...and Kelly's in Boca. They're
trying
to convince me to move there.

28:39.418 --> 28:40.920
Florida's nice.

28:40.920 --> 28:43.255
If you like hurricanes
and early bird specials.

28:43.255 --> 28:47.894
I like my view of the ice
on Lake Michigan.

28:47.894 --> 28:51.798
-Well, it was really good to
meet you.
-It was good to meet you,
Samantha.

28:59.471 --> 29:02.809
Okay, keep me posted on our
college kid.

29:02.809 --> 29:04.911
-Good work in there.
-Thanks. You too.

29:04.911 --> 29:07.146
Dr. Kovac.

29:07.146 --> 29:09.816
-You got a minute?
-Sure.

29:09.816 --> 29:12.919
-In private?
-Yeah.

29:18.390 --> 29:20.426
Are you okay?

29:20.426 --> 29:23.262
Morris, you have the handwriting
of a serial killer.

29:23.262 --> 29:25.531
Excuse me.
My friend wants to ask you
something.

29:25.531 --> 29:27.499
-Yeah?
-I have this bruise.

29:27.499 --> 29:31.203
-You think I got what those
girls have?
-Let me see. Where is it?

29:31.203 --> 29:34.006
Right there.

29:34.006 --> 29:36.876
-I think what you got there is
a--
-A hickey, right?

29:36.876 --> 29:38.377
-Right.
-See, told you.

29:38.377 --> 29:40.012
You're just jealous
because Kevin likes me.

29:40.012 --> 29:41.948
-Am not.
-Are too.

29:41.948 --> 29:45.217
Well, guys, if you go this way,
someone will take care of you,
okay?

29:45.217 --> 29:47.519
Hey, Abby, what do you think
Pratt...

29:47.519 --> 29:49.588
...and your baby daddy
are talking about in 1?

29:49.588 --> 29:52.191
It looks pretty serious.

29:52.191 --> 29:55.527
-Maybe they're talking about
you.
-You think?

29:55.527 --> 29:58.197
Frank, I'm leaving. I need my
cookies.

29:58.197 --> 29:59.932
-Fellas.
-Today would be nice.

29:59.932 --> 30:02.501
Hey, Neela. We need to have a
talk.

30:02.501 --> 30:06.072
-We?
-Yeah.

30:06.072 --> 30:09.275
-Because we care about you--
-Since when?

30:09.275 --> 30:12.178
You know,
it just makes it more difficult
if you're....

30:12.178 --> 30:14.947
Have you all been hit on the
head
with a mallet?

30:14.947 --> 30:16.849
What are you blathering on
about?

30:17.516 --> 30:20.219
Your cookies.

30:20.219 --> 30:22.621
-My cookies?
-Yeah.

30:22.621 --> 30:25.591
After careful consideration
from your ER peers...

30:25.591 --> 30:29.528
...plus Hector in janitorial
services....

30:29.528 --> 30:33.900
Just the feeling is
that your cookies are....

30:33.900 --> 30:37.970
The worst cookies ever made
in the history of baking.

30:37.970 --> 30:39.205
Shut up.

30:42.308 --> 30:44.243
Bollocks to you all.

30:44.243 --> 30:45.444
The truth hurts.

30:45.444 --> 30:47.146
All right, if anyone needs me...

30:47.146 --> 30:52.051
...I'm gonna be in Exam 3
doing a shoulder reduction.

30:52.051 --> 30:54.620
A shoulder reduction is tricky.

30:54.620 --> 30:56.956
I had one where I had to
use my whole body.

30:56.956 --> 30:59.959
Practically had to stand on the
guy
to pop it back in place.

30:59.959 --> 31:05.464
But you gotta get it right the
first time
otherwise the patient's in a lot
of pain.

31:05.464 --> 31:07.399
That would be bad.

31:07.399 --> 31:09.435
I could take this if you want.

31:10.937 --> 31:14.273
I think that is an excellent
idea, Ray.

31:14.273 --> 31:15.942
Thank you.

31:17.944 --> 31:20.479
Frank, see if you can get me
Dr. Kline on the line.

31:20.479 --> 31:22.081
Okay.

31:25.584 --> 31:27.954
You falsified a police report.

31:27.954 --> 31:29.555
Yeah, I guess I did.

31:29.555 --> 31:31.323
That's great.

31:33.659 --> 31:36.996
You-- You know, I'm obligated to
report this
to the state medical board.

31:36.996 --> 31:39.298
-I know.
-They'll investigate...

31:39.298 --> 31:44.570
...and from what you told me,
there's
little doubt they'll suspend
your license.

31:44.570 --> 31:48.607
Your career and reputation gone
because of one moment of
stupidity.

31:48.607 --> 31:51.543
-It didn't seem like that at the
time--
-And now that I know...

31:51.543 --> 31:54.546
...you've involved me too.

31:54.546 --> 31:57.649
-I had to tell you.
-What would you do?

31:57.649 --> 32:02.088
What would you do if you were
me, huh?
What would you do?

32:02.088 --> 32:05.624
Would you risk your career for
someone
who did what you did?

32:05.624 --> 32:11.563
Dr. Kovac, Ortho needs you to
eyeball
an open tib-fib before he goes
upstairs.

32:11.563 --> 32:14.166
-Dr. Kovac?
-Yeah. Just give--

32:14.166 --> 32:16.035
Give us a minute, please.

32:22.708 --> 32:24.710
Okay, you're going on a
vacation.

32:24.710 --> 32:28.680
-What?
-Five days unpaid, starting now.

32:28.680 --> 32:34.620
-You're kidding, right?
-Don't have fun. Don't enjoy it.

32:34.620 --> 32:38.324
Spend it thinking about
what it means to be a doctor.

32:44.363 --> 32:46.298
-Thank you.
-No, no, don't thank me.

32:46.298 --> 32:48.300
It's not a reward.

33:03.082 --> 33:05.051
Thanks again for letting me
get off work early for my date.

33:05.051 --> 33:07.286
Anything for love and pasta.

33:07.286 --> 33:11.057
Basal skull fracture being
admitted for obs
as soon as you take care of your
head lac.

33:11.057 --> 33:13.259
It's already irrigated,
just needs a few staples.

33:13.259 --> 33:15.294
Mr. Gauthier, this is Dr.
Lockhart.

33:15.294 --> 33:17.396
I leave you in her capable
hands.

33:17.396 --> 33:20.132
Hello. How'd you hurt your head?

33:20.132 --> 33:22.501
-Trying to stop an epidemic.
-An epidemic?

33:22.501 --> 33:25.404
Of antisocial behavior.

33:25.404 --> 33:28.440
Why do some parents think it's
okay
for their kid to yell doody...

33:28.440 --> 33:32.311
-...over and over again in
public?
-I've often wondered about that
myself.

33:32.311 --> 33:35.814
Or that it's good manners if
little Emma
or Julian sprawls on the
floor...

33:35.814 --> 33:39.318
...or hurls themselves at
display cases
while you try to enjoy a latte.

33:39.318 --> 33:43.222
So a latte led to your skull
fracture?

33:43.222 --> 33:45.357
When I told Doody Boy
to use his inside voice...

33:45.357 --> 33:47.493
...his mom threatened to call
the cops.

33:47.493 --> 33:51.463
I tripped over a double stroller
on my way out.

33:51.463 --> 33:54.800
-Thank you for being on my side.
-No.

33:54.800 --> 33:56.768
It's not that. It's my baby, I--

33:56.768 --> 33:58.470
I just felt it move.

33:58.470 --> 34:01.307
-You did?
-Yeah, it's the first time.

34:01.307 --> 34:05.111
Great. It's all about you, isn't
it?

34:07.213 --> 34:10.482
All forms of anesthesia
involve some risks.

34:10.482 --> 34:14.520
Although rare, unexpected
severe complications can
occur...

34:14.520 --> 34:18.556
...and include
remote possibility of
infection...

34:18.556 --> 34:24.196
...bleeding, blood clots,
paralysis, stroke, brain
damage...

34:24.196 --> 34:28.134
...loss of sensation, heart
attack
or death.

34:28.134 --> 34:31.703
I understand that these risks
apply
to all forms of anesthesia...

34:31.703 --> 34:36.507
...and that additional or
specific risks
have been identified below.

34:45.150 --> 34:49.888
That concludes the business
portion
of our meeting, ladies and
gentleman.

34:49.888 --> 34:52.158
Let's eat.

34:52.158 --> 34:54.159
I want-- Just a moment.

34:54.159 --> 34:57.563
-Neela, there you are.
-Joan, I am so sorry I'm late.

34:57.563 --> 35:00.666
I know they're not homemade,
but they're very good.

35:00.666 --> 35:01.800
I had a baking setback.

35:01.800 --> 35:04.303
It must be hard.

35:04.303 --> 35:08.674
Frankly, I don't know how you
gals do it,
married to your careers and the
military.

35:12.644 --> 35:14.613
Hey, can I have pizza for
dinner?

35:14.613 --> 35:15.847
I can cook, you know.

35:15.847 --> 35:18.184
Yeah, but not pizza.

35:18.184 --> 35:20.486
Someday you're gonna turn into a
pizza.

35:20.486 --> 35:22.554
-Hey.
-Hey.

35:24.290 --> 35:27.459
-Is that yours?
-Yeah, what do you think?

35:27.459 --> 35:32.198
-It's pretty cool.
-Pretty big.

35:32.198 --> 35:34.900
The next time you and your mommy
wanna take a ride in that...

35:34.900 --> 35:37.369
-...just let me know.
-Awesome.

35:37.369 --> 35:40.339
-Hey, can I have a soda?
-Sure.

35:42.674 --> 35:47.546
You wait inside that store for
me, okay?
And be careful crossing the
street.

35:47.546 --> 35:49.315
Hey, John, go with him.

35:52.451 --> 35:56.222
Great. He is gonna be bugging me
about that ride for weeks.

35:56.222 --> 35:57.589
I meant it.

35:59.725 --> 36:01.860
I'll think about it.

36:01.860 --> 36:04.496
I got something else for you
to think about.

36:04.496 --> 36:06.498
I was in a real firing mood
today.

36:07.766 --> 36:11.237
I fired my primary care doctor.

36:11.237 --> 36:14.806
-I fired the home-care nurse.
-Why'd you do that?

36:14.806 --> 36:18.444
I don't know. I saw you in
action today.
It got me thinking.

36:18.444 --> 36:19.845
I could do better.

36:19.845 --> 36:21.880
Well, it's too bad
that I'm not available.

36:21.880 --> 36:25.251
You're not? That's a shame.

36:25.251 --> 36:26.418
I was offering you the job.

36:28.620 --> 36:30.689
It's very flattering,
but I already have a job.

36:30.689 --> 36:32.291
Which you can keep.

36:32.291 --> 36:34.993
It's a part-time job.
Flexible hours, good pay.

36:34.993 --> 36:38.397
Just check my crit,
give me the transfusions when I
need them.

36:38.397 --> 36:41.833
The overnight chelation therapy
that's gotta be done five times
a week.

36:41.833 --> 36:43.702
Wait, did you say overnight?

36:43.702 --> 36:46.272
No, I can't. I can't. I have
Alex.

36:46.272 --> 36:49.841
I can't be running back and
forth
to your house in the middle of
the night.

36:49.841 --> 36:54.280
That's why you and Alex would be
more than welcome to come live
with me.

36:54.280 --> 36:57.783
-Move in.
-Excuse me?

36:57.783 --> 37:00.719
Listen, you could take a whole
section
of my house right now...

37:00.719 --> 37:02.588
...and have it all to
yourselves.

37:02.588 --> 37:05.791
My live-in housekeeper, Mrs.
Harrison,
has been with me 15 years.

37:05.791 --> 37:08.294
The place is so big,
I hardly see the woman.

37:08.294 --> 37:11.363
She can even watch Alex after
school.

37:11.363 --> 37:15.967
What, is it you feel sorry for
me,
because I'm a single-mom nurse?

37:15.967 --> 37:18.003
We're not a charity case.

37:18.003 --> 37:20.672
It's no charity, it's an
opportunity.

37:29.881 --> 37:31.950
This is just weird.

37:32.884 --> 37:35.321
Think about it, Samantha.

37:35.321 --> 37:37.423
I look forward to hearing from
you.

37:47.065 --> 37:49.635
So how's Michael doing back
in the saddle again?

37:49.635 --> 37:52.604
-Bless him, volunteering to go
back?
-He's fine, doing well.

37:52.604 --> 37:56.342
-Says he's very busy. He misses
me.
-Of course. He'll be home again
soon.

37:56.342 --> 37:58.510
Is Joe gonna be home
in time for the birth?

37:58.510 --> 38:01.413
I don't think so. He'd pass out
in the delivery room anyway.

38:01.413 --> 38:03.549
-I did.
-Seriously.

38:03.549 --> 38:05.083
Of course I want him home.

38:05.083 --> 38:07.419
I knew what I was getting
when I married a soldier.

38:07.419 --> 38:10.722
The long absences, the moving
for the umpteenth time, the pay.

38:10.722 --> 38:12.424
It's sad he's not gonna be here.

38:12.424 --> 38:14.393
It's hard sometimes...

38:14.393 --> 38:17.463
...but that's why I'm so glad
I have Spouse Club and all of
you.

38:17.463 --> 38:21.933
Our loved ones are serving our
country,
it's a small price to pay.

38:21.933 --> 38:25.904
I think it's a huge price to
pay,
especially under the
circumstances.

38:25.904 --> 38:29.107
-What circumstances?
-The way the whole thing's been
handled.

38:29.107 --> 38:31.977
How we got into it,
how it's being managed.

38:31.977 --> 38:33.479
What exactly do you mean?

38:35.381 --> 38:39.385
-Never mind, I'm sorry.
-No, no, go on.

38:39.385 --> 38:42.754
Well, I still haven't seen any
weapons of mass destruction,
have you?

38:42.754 --> 38:45.391
Who's thirsty?

38:45.391 --> 38:49.060
If you don't support the war,
how do you
justify what Michael's doing
there?

38:49.060 --> 38:50.429
I don't justify it.

38:50.429 --> 38:52.598
And I don't support any war...

38:52.598 --> 38:56.635
...but I do support our troops
and I am proud of my husband.

38:56.635 --> 38:58.970
-Doesn't sound that way.
-You can't tell me...

38:58.970 --> 39:02.941
...that you believe 100 percent
in your heart
that we should be in Iraq, can
you?

39:02.941 --> 39:07.413
-I don't think it helps to talk
that way.
-Our duty is to support their
duty.

39:07.413 --> 39:11.016
My duty is to be a good doctor
and to be a good wife.

39:11.016 --> 39:17.088
Not to be brainwashed into
falling in line
with some pseudo-patriotic
delusion.

39:28.834 --> 39:30.969
-I got your page. Are you all
right?
-Yeah.

39:30.969 --> 39:33.138
-They'll be in for you soon.
-Thank you.

39:33.138 --> 39:35.574
-I thought you cancelled this.
-I un-cancelled.

39:35.574 --> 39:39.144
My surgeon was afraid
I'd change my mind again
tomorrow.

39:42.113 --> 39:44.182
There's something I need to ask
you.

39:44.182 --> 39:46.117
Want me to hang around,
check on you in Recovery?

39:46.117 --> 39:48.487
No, that's not it.

39:48.487 --> 39:53.191
If something were to happen in
surgery,
I'd need someone to look after
Henry.

39:53.191 --> 39:55.794
-Nothing's gonna happen in
surgery.
-But if it does.

39:55.794 --> 39:57.463
Would you be Henry's legal
guardian?

40:04.436 --> 40:07.539
Well, what about Sandy's
parents?

40:07.539 --> 40:12.478
They're-- They're wonderful with
him,
but they're getting older and
I--

40:12.478 --> 40:14.513
I just need to know that he'd be
okay.

40:16.915 --> 40:19.184
And you know that it's--
It's not just me now.

40:19.184 --> 40:20.886
That Luka's in my life.

40:20.886 --> 40:23.655
He's a good man.
He's gonna be a great father.

40:25.557 --> 40:27.626
Look, is this even possible to
do now?

40:27.626 --> 40:31.497
I mean, isn't there something I
have to do?
Sign a legal thing? Something?

40:31.497 --> 40:36.768
I had these drawn up the first
time
that I scheduled the surgery.

40:36.768 --> 40:38.770
Can you just give us a second,
please?

40:43.074 --> 40:45.677
You know,
sometimes it's hard being alone.

40:48.246 --> 40:50.882
But I've always felt like
I could depend on you.

40:55.754 --> 40:57.155
You can.

41:00.258 --> 41:02.561
Thanks.

41:17.242 --> 41:19.778
-Ray?
-Hey.

41:21.980 --> 41:24.916
-Were you watching Ghost?
-What?

41:24.916 --> 41:27.553
No, no, it's the-- It's the
game.

41:27.553 --> 41:30.656
-Where's your date?
-Oh, yeah.

41:31.723 --> 41:32.924
Something happened.

41:33.825 --> 41:36.728
She stood you up.

41:36.728 --> 41:38.730
Yeah, fine.

41:38.730 --> 41:42.067
You know, if that's what you
wanna hear,
she stood me up, okay?

41:42.067 --> 41:44.603
Well, you are a mere mortal
after all.

41:49.274 --> 41:51.577
Rough night?

41:51.577 --> 41:54.145
Is it possible to kick yourself
out of a club?

41:56.147 --> 41:59.618
Well, to better times, huh?

42:00.886 --> 42:02.153
Yeah.

42:08.994 --> 42:12.731
You know, I feel very proud of
Michael...

42:12.731 --> 42:15.300
...but sometimes
when I'm with those other
wives...

42:15.300 --> 42:19.938
...I start to get so angry,
frustrated...

42:19.938 --> 42:21.840
...and I talk too much.

42:21.840 --> 42:24.275
You? Talk too much?

42:24.275 --> 42:26.878
It's only because I miss him.

42:29.781 --> 42:33.685
-This is utterly pathetic.
-What?

42:33.685 --> 42:36.855
This. A married woman
living like a college student...

42:36.855 --> 42:39.224
...crying next to her roommate
on his sofa.

42:41.192 --> 42:45.831
Okay, well, I have something
that'll make you feel better.

42:50.769 --> 42:52.971
You recorded it for me.

42:52.971 --> 42:56.341
Anything for my roomie.

42:56.341 --> 43:00.879
It's lights, camera, action.
Tonight on the World Poker
Tour.

43:00.879 --> 43:06.652
They play until one player
wins all the chips on the table.

43:06.652 --> 43:08.754
Take some deep breaths.

43:16.394 --> 43:18.329
You'll start feeling sleepy.

43:20.666 --> 43:23.301
Count backwards from 100, Kerry.

43:24.770 --> 43:28.273
One hundred, 99...

43:30.341 --> 43:34.279
...98, 97...

43:35.881 --> 43:40.285
...96, 95....
