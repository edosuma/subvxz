00:02.296 --> 00:04.646
(Jane) I am through listening to you.

00:04.648 --> 00:06.419
All your little missions.

00:06.421 --> 00:08.124
The USB drive.

00:08.125 --> 00:10.223
The GPS tracker, the pen!

00:10.225 --> 00:12.275
None of it is what you said it was!

00:12.277 --> 00:14.936
You used me to frame Mayfair for murder!

00:14.938 --> 00:16.279
I know this is hard.

00:16.280 --> 00:18.368
I know you trusted her, but Bethany Mayfair

00:18.370 --> 00:21.225
was responsible for some
very, very bad things, Taylor.

00:21.227 --> 00:23.345
Then she should pay for those things!

00:23.347 --> 00:26.047
But she should not go to prison
for something she didn't do!

00:26.049 --> 00:28.161
Yes! Yes, that's exactly what she deserves.

00:28.163 --> 00:30.374
That's insane.

00:30.376 --> 00:32.235
Nothing you say can convince me

00:32.238 --> 00:34.093
that this is right.

00:34.095 --> 00:35.761
(woman) Then maybe I can try.

00:38.403 --> 00:41.290
I know you feel lost.

00:42.133 --> 00:44.656
I know you feel lost.

00:44.658 --> 00:46.315
Like ending it all is the only way

00:46.317 --> 00:48.650
that you can make up for what you've done.

00:48.652 --> 00:50.185
But you're wrong.

00:51.980 --> 00:53.344
Sofia?

00:53.346 --> 00:54.898
Your name is Sofia.

00:54.900 --> 00:56.498
Bethany and I fell in love.

00:56.500 --> 00:59.330
But you also fell prey to temptation.

00:59.332 --> 01:00.398
In Mayfair's case...

01:00.400 --> 01:03.282
...using illegal intel
and fake informants...

01:03.284 --> 01:07.223
...to force convictions
that should never have stood.

01:07.225 --> 01:08.312
"Daylight."

01:08.314 --> 01:10.364
We worked outside the law.

01:10.366 --> 01:12.009
And committed great wrongs.

01:12.011 --> 01:16.352
And only by working
outside the law again...

01:16.354 --> 01:18.250
...can we set them right.

01:18.252 --> 01:20.577
You saved my life that night.

01:20.579 --> 01:22.074
In more ways than one.

01:22.076 --> 01:25.241
So help us make this right.

01:25.243 --> 01:28.513
This is your chance to buy back your soul.

01:29.432 --> 01:31.373
This is the plan?

01:31.375 --> 01:32.830
Ousting Mayfair?

01:32.832 --> 01:34.758
We're just getting started.

01:34.760 --> 01:36.311
Let's call this phase one.

01:36.313 --> 01:39.784
Bethany needed to be removed from power.

01:39.786 --> 01:42.001
Made accountable for her actions.

01:42.003 --> 01:45.910
I begged her to walk away, twice!

01:47.236 --> 01:48.778
But she refused.

01:48.780 --> 01:51.101
Taylor, look at me.

01:51.103 --> 01:53.711
We don't do any of this lightly.

01:53.713 --> 01:56.406
But this is how it has to be.

01:56.408 --> 01:58.423
And why should I trust you?

01:58.425 --> 01:59.688
You shouldn't.

01:59.690 --> 02:01.423
You should trust yourself.

From when you were all kids.

Oh...

03:48.703 --> 03:50.313
What about...

03:50.315 --> 03:54.083
when we camped in the fort in the backyard?

03:54.085 --> 03:57.059
Remember, I tried to tell a ghost story,

03:57.061 --> 03:58.372
and I scared myself.

03:58.374 --> 04:00.612
- And I scared you, too.

04:02.987 --> 04:04.647
Oh, damn it.

04:04.649 --> 04:06.962
Yeah, Dad, I've gotta go.

04:06.964 --> 04:08.665
I'm meeting a friend.

04:08.667 --> 04:11.088
Do you mind staying

04:11.090 --> 04:12.308
No, of course not.

04:12.310 --> 04:13.636

Yeah.

04:36.706 --> 04:37.659
You talked to her?

04:37.661 --> 04:39.924
No, she didn't put me on her visitors list.

04:39.926 --> 04:42.412
Can you think of anything
that would help her case?

04:43.961 --> 04:47.413
(electronic voice) <i>Stop looking
into Tom Carter's disappearance.</i>

04:47.415 --> 04:49.627
What are you thinking?

04:49.629 --> 04:53.414
The focus of the investigation
has shifted... to Mayfair.

04:53.416 --> 04:56.175
I think I have some
things I have to tell you.

04:58.046 --> 05:00.214
You might not like some of them.

05:00.216 --> 05:02.416
Well, I guess I got a few
things to tell you, too.

05:10.952 --> 05:12.606
Here.

05:12.608 --> 05:14.067
Been collecting this for you.

05:14.069 --> 05:15.777
I didn't want anyone
thinking no one was home.

05:15.779 --> 05:17.827

Oh, it's more comfortable than it looks.

05:30.970 --> 05:33.005
I wish you'd let me come visit you.

05:33.007 --> 05:35.613
I didn't want any of
you to visit me in there.

05:35.615 --> 05:38.038
House arrest is much more dignified.

05:38.040 --> 05:39.238

05:39.240 --> 05:40.024

I'll come by every couple of days

05:41.970 --> 05:43.985
brief you, keep you in the loop.

05:43.987 --> 05:45.885
That way, when you come back to work,

05:45.887 --> 05:47.411
you can hit the ground running.

05:48.694 --> 05:51.537
The director paid me a visit yesterday.

05:51.539 --> 05:54.301
Apparently, I'm bad for optics.

05:54.303 --> 05:57.545
He suggests I stop talking about frame jobs

05:57.547 --> 06:01.025
and faked deaths and take a plea.

06:01.027 --> 06:03.517
So no one else believes that Sofia's alive?

06:03.519 --> 06:04.659
Do you?

06:04.661 --> 06:07.669
Yes. I do.

06:07.671 --> 06:09.837
But we can't find anything concrete.

06:11.105 --> 06:14.884
Now, I know we're not the
official investigators on this.

06:14.886 --> 06:16.832
But I need you to fill
in some blanks for me.

06:16.834 --> 06:19.222
Some blanks should stay blank.

06:19.224 --> 06:21.432
You should come clean about Daylight.

06:21.434 --> 06:23.136
I've gone over it and over it.

06:23.138 --> 06:24.482
Without that piece of the puzzle,

06:24.484 --> 06:25.821
there's nothing that I can do.

06:25.823 --> 06:28.431
Hundreds of convictions overturned.

06:28.433 --> 06:29.695
Guilty criminals walk.

06:29.697 --> 06:32.172
I won't do that just to vindicate myself.

06:32.174 --> 06:33.672
You didn't kill anyone.

06:33.674 --> 06:35.801
I cheated the system, and I lost.

06:35.803 --> 06:37.600
I don't want you touching Daylight.

06:37.602 --> 06:38.750
Do you hear me?

06:38.752 --> 06:41.155
So what else do I do? I need that piece...

06:41.157 --> 06:44.290
We'll find another way. We always do.

06:46.135 --> 06:47.459
Now, get out of here.

06:47.461 --> 06:50.195
You're late for your
Human Resources meeting.

06:51.216 --> 06:53.325
We're not giving up.

06:53.327 --> 06:54.693
And neither are you.

06:57.220 --> 06:59.242
I never should have talked to Weitz.

06:59.244 --> 07:00.842
He had you over a barrel.

07:00.844 --> 07:02.289
Why would you think
there'd be anything to find?

07:02.291 --> 07:03.387
I would have done the same thing.

07:03.389 --> 07:05.940
No, you wouldn't have.

07:05.942 --> 07:07.976
I don't know what pisses me off more...

07:07.978 --> 07:10.931
they think she's a killer or
that they think she's that stupid.

07:10.933 --> 07:12.727
Yeah, if she did take out Carter,

07:12.729 --> 07:14.713
why would she ask me to
look into his disappearance?

07:14.715 --> 07:16.220
How does that make any sense?

07:16.222 --> 07:18.248
What makes a hell of a lot more sense

07:18.250 --> 07:21.078
is that guy who threatened you at gunpoint.

07:21.080 --> 07:23.221
Like, maybe if you tell them that...

07:23.223 --> 07:25.294
They threatened Sarah and Sawyer's lives.

07:25.296 --> 07:28.078
Meanwhile, they can get to
me, they can get to them.

07:28.080 --> 07:28.953
No, no way.

07:28.955 --> 07:30.020
"They"?

07:33.265 --> 07:34.671
You think it's a "they"?

07:34.673 --> 07:38.058
Well, "they" just took out the head
of the New York branch of the FBI.

07:38.060 --> 07:41.995
Until we find out who this is
or how far they've infiltrated...

07:41.997 --> 07:43.757
we don't know who we can trust.

07:46.243 --> 07:48.593

Assistant Director is holding up.

08:01.391 --> 08:03.214
Trying to prove Mayfair's innocence,

08:03.216 --> 08:06.342
than stuck in here... shuffling papers.

08:06.344 --> 08:08.677
Ah, you won't be on the hook for long.

replacements for the position today.

08:13.451 --> 08:16.207
This is Bethany Mayfair's job.

08:16.209 --> 08:17.544
She's innocent.

08:17.546 --> 08:19.758
No... she's not, Kurt.

08:19.760 --> 08:21.487
And the sooner you make peace with that,

08:21.489 --> 08:24.411
the better for you and for
everyone under your command.

08:24.413 --> 08:26.972
Is that what you came here to tell me?

08:26.974 --> 08:28.177
To make peace with it?

08:28.179 --> 08:29.649
No.

08:29.651 --> 08:32.768
In light of Mayfair's arrest,

08:32.770 --> 08:36.039
there've been some concerns
regarding one of her cases

08:36.042 --> 08:41.390
and the time and resources it
seems to have been consuming.

08:41.393 --> 08:42.693
You talking about Jane?

08:42.695 --> 08:45.321
We're putting the entire
situation under review.

08:45.323 --> 08:47.209
Review?

08:47.211 --> 08:48.433
What does that mean?

08:48.435 --> 08:53.675
It means any related investigations
are suspended until further notice.

08:53.677 --> 08:56.591

11:09.917 --> 11:11.826
Sofia's alive

11:11.828 --> 11:14.338
and asks me for money.

11:14.340 --> 11:16.001
I give it to her.

11:17.335 --> 11:19.808
They kill Alexandra.

11:19.810 --> 11:23.417
And threaten me just like
they threatened Reade.

11:23.419 --> 11:26.070
So how did these two know each other?

11:27.233 --> 11:30.969
The same cash I give to Sofia...

11:33.958 --> 11:37.099
I rescue Alexandra in the bar...

11:37.101 --> 11:40.587
Let her go and walk away.

11:45.892 --> 11:47.454
I rescue her.

11:49.864 --> 11:51.079
The hell I did.

11:51.081 --> 11:53.915
That bald son of a bitch!

11:57.764 --> 12:00.113
(beeping)

12:00.115 --> 12:01.548
(hinges squeak)

12:18.518 --> 12:21.987
(alarm beeping)

12:25.385 --> 12:26.906
Yeah, hi.

12:26.908 --> 12:28.948
Yeah, it just started going off.

12:28.950 --> 12:32.021
Well, you can see I'm still at home, right?

12:32.023 --> 12:34.353
Well, I just don't want any trouble.

12:34.355 --> 12:35.810
- (click, beeping stops)
- Huh.

12:35.812 --> 12:38.258
Yeah, there it goes.

12:38.260 --> 12:40.483
Well, sorry to bother you.

12:40.485 --> 12:41.903
Tomorrow.

12:41.905 --> 12:44.463
Yeah, that's fine. I
should be home all day.

12:46.461 --> 12:49.122
Okay, that was a joke.

12:49.124 --> 12:51.391
Right. Thanks. Bye.

12:59.305 --> 13:00.428
What's with all the secrecy?

13:00.430 --> 13:03.755
You practically just smuggled
me through the backdoor.

13:03.757 --> 13:04.963
(Weller) Temporary precautions.

13:04.965 --> 13:06.305
Why are we even working the case at all?

13:06.307 --> 13:08.859
Shouldn't we focus on Mayfair?
We all know she's innocent.

13:08.861 --> 13:11.522
I'm just as upset about
Mayfair as you all are.

13:11.524 --> 13:13.282
But there's nothing that
we can do for her right now.

13:13.284 --> 13:14.639
What do we know about this baby?

13:14.641 --> 13:17.393
Can I just say what
we're all thinking anyway?

13:17.395 --> 13:20.187
That this baby has a lot more in
common with Jane than the tattoo.

13:20.189 --> 13:22.335
Unknown identity, unknown origin.

13:22.337 --> 13:25.105
She even came out of a bag.

13:25.107 --> 13:27.297
You don't think that we've
come from the same place?

13:27.299 --> 13:28.220
Where is this child?

13:28.222 --> 13:30.121
Protective Services.

13:30.123 --> 13:32.315
Interestingly, in the
same building she was left.

13:32.317 --> 13:33.625
We're running the baby's DNA now,

13:33.627 --> 13:35.527
seeing if it matches
anything in our database.

13:35.529 --> 13:37.064
And the bag man?

13:37.066 --> 13:39.432
We got a positive ID on
any of the security footage?

13:39.434 --> 13:42.018
Edward Donella, former
nurse at Grace Central.

13:42.020 --> 13:43.600
His license was revoked over a year ago

13:43.602 --> 13:46.332
for administering pain meds
without a doctor's consent.

13:46.334 --> 13:47.981
There's no record of employment since.

13:47.983 --> 13:50.659
Let's visit Grace Central and see
what his coworkers say about him.

13:50.661 --> 13:53.043
- (beeping)
- Uh...

13:53.045 --> 13:55.425
Or you could speak to him directly.

13:55.427 --> 13:58.338
He just sent an email from an
Internet cafe from his sister-in-law,

13:58.340 --> 14:02.384
a criminal defense lawyer asking to
meet him in Arlington Square in an hour.

14:02.386 --> 14:05.246
Great... let's get to the hospital.

14:05.248 --> 14:06.381
Let's move.

14:08.203 --> 14:10.502
It's past the scheduled meeting time.

14:10.504 --> 14:12.392
Maybe the message was a decoy.

14:12.394 --> 14:14.892
Hold on a second. Zapata, coming your way.

14:14.894 --> 14:16.160
On it.

14:19.956 --> 14:20.878
It's her.

14:20.880 --> 14:22.602
So where is Edward?

14:22.604 --> 14:24.573
- (Patterson) <i>I got something.</i>
- Go ahead, Patterson.

14:24.575 --> 14:26.523
So we just got the baby's DNA tests back.

14:26.525 --> 14:27.942
She's a genetic match

14:27.944 --> 14:30.110
<i>to Bryce Warren.</i>

14:30.112 --> 14:31.437
Whoa.

14:31.439 --> 14:33.055
Who's Bryce Warren?

14:33.057 --> 14:34.565
(Reade) <i>Just some ex-party kid.</i>

14:34.567 --> 14:36.382
But his father's Peter Warren,

14:36.384 --> 14:38.723
major presidential contender
in the last election.

14:38.725 --> 14:40.805
(Zapata) <i>And a billionaire</i>
<i>businessman.</i>

14:40.807 --> 14:43.147
What's his granddaughter doing in the bag?

14:45.373 --> 14:47.519
Hey, guys, I think we got Edward.

14:50.021 --> 14:51.054
(Weller) Got him.

14:51.056 --> 14:52.588
On my call.

14:56.612 --> 14:57.793
Now.

14:57.795 --> 14:59.480
Down! Get down!

14:59.482 --> 15:00.677
FBI! Get on the ground.

15:00.679 --> 15:01.833
- FBI.
- I'm sorry!

15:01.835 --> 15:05.503
I-I tried to convince myself that we
were helping, but they had to be stopped!

15:05.505 --> 15:07.839
(gunshots, crowd screaming)

15:09.662 --> 15:14.178
(woman shrieking)

15:14.180 --> 15:15.741
You got a position on the shooters?

15:15.743 --> 15:17.371
Rooftop, northeast!

15:17.373 --> 15:18.947
Reade! Tasha! Your building!

15:18.949 --> 15:20.449
Come to me. Come to me.

15:20.451 --> 15:21.721
Come here!

15:21.723 --> 15:22.859
Get down behind there.

15:22.861 --> 15:23.902
Stay down.

15:23.904 --> 15:25.303
(woman whimpering)

15:25.305 --> 15:27.227
(Weller) Stay down!

15:27.229 --> 15:30.196
Weller, the insignia...
it's the same as the tattoo.

15:39.329 --> 15:41.221
The symbol on Edward's scrubs

15:41.223 --> 15:43.434
was the same as the
symbol on the Warren baby.

15:43.436 --> 15:45.065
Shooters didn't give us much to follow.

15:45.067 --> 15:46.973
No shell casings, no witnesses.

15:46.975 --> 15:49.026
What about his
sister-in-law, the lawyer?

15:49.028 --> 15:50.304
Did she give us anything?

15:50.306 --> 15:51.869
Only that Edward has been
estranged from his family

15:51.871 --> 15:53.418
since he lost his job.

15:53.420 --> 15:56.254
This is the first time anyone
has heard from him in over a year.

15:56.256 --> 15:59.594
He said he tried to convince
himself that they were helping.

15:59.596 --> 16:00.834
But he just couldn't do it anymore.

16:00.836 --> 16:02.797
That "they" needed to be stopped.

16:02.799 --> 16:05.787
Whatever Edward was into, he was
having a crisis of conscience.

16:05.789 --> 16:06.933
So he steals a baby?

16:06.935 --> 16:08.647
Not just any baby.

16:08.649 --> 16:10.177
Peter Warren's granddaughter.

16:10.179 --> 16:12.151
(Patterson) Yeah, but from where?

16:12.153 --> 16:15.164
I can't find any public
records of this child's birth.

16:15.166 --> 16:16.758
More importantly,

16:16.760 --> 16:20.034
why haven't the Warrens
reported her missing?

16:20.036 --> 16:22.236
(knocking on glass)

16:25.228 --> 16:27.374
(Weller) Bryce Warren?

16:27.376 --> 16:28.159
Yes?

16:28.161 --> 16:29.136
The FBI.

16:29.138 --> 16:32.426
Wanna know if I could have a
word with you and your wife.

16:32.428 --> 16:33.433
About?

16:33.435 --> 16:35.635
Did you have a child recently?

16:37.233 --> 16:38.133
What?

16:39.722 --> 16:41.012
What's going on?

16:41.014 --> 16:43.257
A baby was stolen and left
outside a government building

16:43.259 --> 16:44.717
this morning in downtown.

16:44.719 --> 16:48.439
Genetic testing indicates
you're the father.

16:48.441 --> 16:50.159
How could you?

16:50.161 --> 16:52.172
I didn't do anything.

16:52.174 --> 16:53.490
- Bryce...
- Tracy, I swear.

16:53.492 --> 16:56.687
Mr. Warren, people make mistakes sometimes.

16:56.689 --> 16:58.999
But right now... I need you to be honest.

16:59.001 --> 17:00.634
I did not have an affair.

17:01.743 --> 17:03.812
I have one child, our child,

17:03.814 --> 17:06.309
and he's upstairs, where he always is.

17:07.911 --> 17:10.646
(heart monitor beeping)

17:20.113 --> 17:21.638
(knock on door)

17:26.219 --> 17:28.035
Whoa, whoa, whoa! What the hell?

17:28.037 --> 17:30.376
What the hell is going on?

17:30.378 --> 17:31.690
Maybe you shouldn't leave your number

17:31.692 --> 17:34.125
with the bartender when
you're running a con.

17:34.127 --> 17:36.645
- What the hell are you talking about?
- Donna Hollaran?

17:36.647 --> 17:40.791
Called herself "Alexandra" when
I rescued her from you at the bar.

17:40.793 --> 17:42.582
(Dennis) At least finish
the bottle with me.

17:42.584 --> 17:43.395
Dennis!

17:43.397 --> 17:44.819
How do you two know each other?

17:44.821 --> 17:46.271
Uh, I work for her sometimes.

17:46.273 --> 17:47.930
- Doing what?
- I-I don't know.

17:47.932 --> 17:49.222
I drive around places.

17:49.224 --> 17:50.772
I pretend to pick her up in bars.

17:50.774 --> 17:53.569
Not asking any questions.

17:53.571 --> 17:54.724
You know him?

17:56.098 --> 17:58.101
I don't know him. Should I?

17:58.103 --> 17:59.479
You know her?

17:59.481 --> 18:00.430
Yeah. Yeah.

18:00.432 --> 18:02.822
I, uh, drove down to meet her a few times.

18:02.824 --> 18:04.543
- Where?
- I don't know.

18:04.545 --> 18:05.412
Different places.

18:05.414 --> 18:06.774
What did they talk about?

18:06.776 --> 18:08.180
I waited in the car.

18:08.182 --> 18:10.206
Look, all I know is she
seemed stressed as hell

18:10.208 --> 18:13.076
and she kept smoking funny
cigarettes all the time.

18:16.297 --> 18:17.202
What?

18:17.204 --> 18:18.919
(Mayfair) They're French.

18:18.921 --> 18:20.042
Tough to find.

18:20.044 --> 18:21.486
(Dennis) Really? Well, so's Donna.

18:21.488 --> 18:25.153
I mean, have you seen her
lately? She owes me like 50 bucks.

18:25.155 --> 18:27.074
Good luck collecting.

18:32.586 --> 18:35.022
The child is a genetic match to you.

18:35.024 --> 18:36.202
How do you explain that?

18:36.204 --> 18:38.767
It's a mistake.

18:38.769 --> 18:40.055
It has to be.

18:40.057 --> 18:42.341
Look, I had my troubles when I was younger,

18:42.343 --> 18:45.348
but I don't sleep around anymore.

18:45.350 --> 18:47.575
I found God.

18:47.577 --> 18:49.740
My path has been righteous.

18:49.742 --> 18:52.283
Even if he was that kind
of person, which he isn't,

18:52.285 --> 18:54.430
I honestly, I don't know
where he'd find the time.

18:54.432 --> 18:56.281
With Matthew's condition,

18:56.283 --> 18:58.746
looking after him takes
everything we've got.

18:58.748 --> 19:00.247
(door opens)

19:02.101 --> 19:05.025
What do you people think you're doing?

19:05.027 --> 19:08.155
Why is a former presidential
candidate calling me to complain

19:08.157 --> 19:12.740
that the FBI just invaded his son's
home to accuse him of infidelity?

19:12.742 --> 19:14.114
We were following a lead.

19:14.116 --> 19:15.868
Right, same one that got a man killed

19:15.870 --> 19:19.043
in front of you in Arlington
Square this morning.

19:19.045 --> 19:21.021
Yeah, I looked into your lead.

19:21.023 --> 19:23.944
A baby with a tattoo on its wrist?

19:23.946 --> 19:27.301
The same one your consultant has on hers?

19:27.303 --> 19:28.870
Perhaps I wasn't clear.

19:28.872 --> 19:32.261
When I said the Jane Doe
project was suspended,

19:32.263 --> 19:35.779
I meant <i>all</i> Jane
Doe cases, and Jane Doe.

19:35.781 --> 19:38.133
Explain how we've arrived at this point.

19:38.135 --> 19:40.854
We were in the field
already, investigating.

19:40.856 --> 19:42.169
Weller tried to call us off.

19:42.171 --> 19:43.723
We were already engaged, so...

19:43.725 --> 19:46.677
Look, stop. I didn't tell them.

19:46.679 --> 19:48.545
I... it was my call.

19:48.547 --> 19:50.798
This kind of thing might
have flown with Mayfair,

19:50.800 --> 19:52.813
but it doesn't fly with me.

19:52.815 --> 19:54.764
What about this dead nurse?

19:54.766 --> 19:57.277
Or the circumstances around this child?

19:57.279 --> 19:59.988
However we got into it,
we're not gonna drop it now.

19:59.990 --> 20:02.241
The child has been placed
with Family Services.

20:02.243 --> 20:03.392
Let them sort it out.

20:03.394 --> 20:04.802
You can investigate the shooting,

20:04.804 --> 20:08.402
but you leave Peter Warren
and his family alone.

20:08.404 --> 20:11.080
And, just to remove any ambiguity,

20:11.082 --> 20:13.956
I want Jane Doe off this team.

20:13.958 --> 20:17.872
She's to surrender her weapon and leave
this building until further notice.

20:17.874 --> 20:19.116
That is <i>not</i> necessary.

20:19.118 --> 20:20.151
You can't do that.

20:20.153 --> 20:21.609
I just did.

20:21.611 --> 20:22.943
Dismissed.

20:32.808 --> 20:35.830
This little girl was left
in a bag, totally helpless.

20:35.832 --> 20:37.708
No one knows where she came
from or who left her there.

20:37.710 --> 20:40.329
- Doesn't that remind you of someone?
- Of course it does.

20:40.331 --> 20:42.602
Gonna do everything
that we can to help her.

20:42.604 --> 20:44.984
We've had so many cases where
I physically needed to be there.

20:44.986 --> 20:46.435
What if I need to be there for this?

20:46.437 --> 20:48.457
We've got no choice right now, Jane.

20:48.459 --> 20:51.207
So that's it? I'm out, just like that?

20:51.209 --> 20:52.862
Of course not... you know how important

20:52.864 --> 20:55.411
you are to me, to this team.

20:55.413 --> 20:57.746
But you need to give
me some time to fix it.

20:57.748 --> 20:59.097
(elevator bell chimes)

21:00.482 --> 21:02.277
This is temporary.

21:02.279 --> 21:03.566
I hope so.

21:07.308 --> 21:09.176
Hey, we've got something.

21:10.213 --> 21:13.149
So I expedited the Tracy Warren DNA test.

21:13.151 --> 21:16.294
Tracy Warren is the
infant's biological mother.

21:16.296 --> 21:19.087
That woman clearly did not
just carry a child to term.

21:19.089 --> 21:22.345
I can't find any medical records
indicating a pregnancy or birth

21:22.347 --> 21:23.900
since their first child.

21:23.902 --> 21:26.095
Secret surrogate? They're private people.

21:26.097 --> 21:27.652
Privacy's one thing.

21:27.654 --> 21:29.753
But they wouldn't report it
once the baby was missing?

21:29.755 --> 21:32.731
If the Warrens knew about this
kid before we told them about it,

21:34.496 --> 21:37.046
Their son, Matthew... what's his condition?

21:37.048 --> 21:38.956
Acute myeloid leukemia,

21:38.958 --> 21:40.953
a rare and aggressive cancer of the blood.

21:40.955 --> 21:42.331
How long does he have?

21:42.333 --> 21:46.772
The five-year survival rate for
someone with AML is only 26%.

21:46.774 --> 21:48.605
There are treatments to
slow the cancer down...

21:48.607 --> 21:51.286
- Like chemo?
- Yeah, but that's not enough.

21:51.288 --> 21:53.563
He needs a bone marrow transplant.

21:53.565 --> 21:55.618
From a genetic match.

But I can order them for you, if you...

24:36.010 --> 24:37.094
leave a number.

24:37.096 --> 24:39.490
Just did that for a lady
about a couple weeks ago.

24:41.791 --> 24:43.771
This lady?

24:43.773 --> 24:45.101
You see her recently?

24:45.103 --> 24:46.403
No.

24:50.279 --> 24:52.246
But she did leave a number.

Thanks.

24:59.743 --> 25:01.657
(Patterson) So three unknown assailants

25:01.659 --> 25:03.165
cut the security feed at the building,

25:03.167 --> 25:06.987
then come after the Warren
mystery baby at Child Services.

25:06.989 --> 25:09.657
Eyewitnesses claim one unknown woman

25:09.659 --> 25:12.355
with black hair and
tattoos tries to stop them.

25:12.357 --> 25:13.910

another in the hallway.

25:17.200 --> 25:18.761
(grunting)

25:18.763 --> 25:20.579
And that was where the
third kills a social worker,

25:20.581 --> 25:22.887
a security guard, and
gets away with the child.

25:24.470 --> 25:26.496
And now, this tattooed woman is missing.

25:26.498 --> 25:29.943
Mrs. Warren. What are you doing here?

25:29.945 --> 25:31.445
I called her.

25:32.790 --> 25:34.403
What can I do to help?

Hello?

25:40.892 --> 25:42.729
(Mayfair) <i>Reade, it's me.</i>

25:42.731 --> 25:44.434
Hey, I been trying to call
you, see how you're holding up,

25:44.436 --> 25:45.836
but your phone's...

25:47.511 --> 25:49.084
What number is this?

25:49.086 --> 25:51.462
I was hoping you could do me a favor.

25:51.464 --> 25:54.603
Please tell me you're still at home and
you did not just break your house arrest.

25:54.605 --> 25:57.392
I'm still at home, and I didn't
just break my house arrest.

25:57.394 --> 25:59.132
Are you crazy? They find
out you're not at home,

25:59.134 --> 26:00.396
you know what they're gonna do to you?

26:00.398 --> 26:01.881
They're not going to.

26:01.883 --> 26:03.928
All right, what's this about?

26:03.930 --> 26:06.709
- Do you trust me?
- Yes... always.

26:06.711 --> 26:09.594
I was wondering if you
could trace a number for me.

26:09.596 --> 26:11.547
Find a location.

26:11.549 --> 26:13.534
I completely understand
if you don't wanna...

26:13.536 --> 26:15.002
What's the number?

26:17.795 --> 26:18.702
All right.

26:18.704 --> 26:20.691
<i>I'll look into it. I just hope...</i>

26:20.693 --> 26:22.845
I know, hope I'm doing the right thing.

26:22.847 --> 26:24.088
Me, too.

26:24.090 --> 26:26.079
Hey, thanks.

26:26.081 --> 26:27.592
<i>For what?</i>

26:27.594 --> 26:29.416
For trusting me.

26:29.418 --> 26:30.879
Always.

26:30.881 --> 26:32.881
Call me back on this number, okay?

26:37.641 --> 26:39.152
If she's broken her bail...

26:39.154 --> 26:41.246
I'm just helping her trace a number.

26:41.248 --> 26:43.293
Did she give you a number
you can call her back on?

26:44.240 --> 26:46.328
We can trace it and bring
her back in before she...

26:46.330 --> 26:48.697
- I thought we wanted to help her.
- We do...

26:48.699 --> 26:52.631
but is she helping herself
or just digging a deeper hole?

26:52.633 --> 26:55.991
You look me in the eye and you
tell me you're not worried, too.

26:57.804 --> 26:59.738
She needs our help.

27:01.211 --> 27:03.045
Our son is dying.

27:03.262 --> 27:06.204
He'd need several bone marrow transplants

27:06.206 --> 27:08.773
over his lifetime to survive.

27:09.921 --> 27:14.158
Best chance at a match
was a sibling, but we...

27:14.222 --> 27:16.684
we couldn't face bringing
another child into the world

27:16.686 --> 27:19.981
who could have the same affliction.

27:20.036 --> 27:23.093
Bryce lost a brother to
it. So did his father.

27:23.095 --> 27:26.619
So... we've... been exploring

27:26.621 --> 27:29.769
an alternative option.

27:29.840 --> 27:31.732
How alternative?

27:31.793 --> 27:34.155
Last year, Bryce's father...

27:34.222 --> 27:37.373
told us about a medical research program

27:37.419 --> 27:40.273
that he's helping to fund.

27:40.275 --> 27:42.845
They're on the verge of being able to print

27:42.866 --> 27:45.821
genetically coded organic material.

27:45.862 --> 27:48.624
Organs, tissue.

27:48.676 --> 27:49.884
Bone marrow.

27:49.923 --> 27:51.304
You and your husband...

27:51.351 --> 27:52.948
gave genetic samples?

27:53.024 --> 27:54.265
Yes.

27:54.267 --> 27:55.851
They sedated us,

27:55.853 --> 27:59.023
and they took all kinds of samples.

27:59.025 --> 28:01.932
Last month, the company had a breakthrough.

28:01.934 --> 28:04.533
But Peter said it would take years

28:04.535 --> 28:07.002
to get it approved, and Matthew...

28:08.980 --> 28:11.047
He doesn't have years.

28:13.236 --> 28:14.611
(crying softly)

28:14.613 --> 28:16.780
So... Bryce's father,

28:16.782 --> 28:19.911
he convinced us to let them
do the first transplant,

28:19.959 --> 28:22.994
in secret, off the books.

28:23.058 --> 28:25.446
When?

28:25.471 --> 28:27.016
Tomorrow.

28:27.189 --> 28:28.622
Where?

28:29.753 --> 28:33.191
Do you know what it's like...

28:33.277 --> 28:36.578
to have no hope and then get it back again?

28:39.422 --> 28:41.523
They're not growing tissue.

28:43.464 --> 28:45.193
They're growing children.

28:45.195 --> 28:46.569
With surrogates.

28:46.571 --> 28:47.736
(crying) Sur...

28:47.738 --> 28:50.639
Mrs. Warren, you came here

28:50.641 --> 28:53.414
to help this baby.

28:53.416 --> 28:55.248
Your baby.

28:55.312 --> 28:57.173
We need that address.

29:01.728 --> 29:03.722
(Jane) All right, we're at the facility.

29:03.724 --> 29:05.057
How do I get inside?

29:07.951 --> 29:09.027
All right.

29:10.104 --> 29:10.974
Jesus!

29:10.976 --> 29:13.173
This is not a game you wanna play with me.

29:13.175 --> 29:15.887
Key fob... left pocket.

29:21.466 --> 29:22.600
Thank you.

29:33.996 --> 29:35.317

29:39.005 --> 29:40.953

29:43.625 --> 29:46.828
Towers triangulate a location where
a majority of the calls originated,

29:46.830 --> 29:49.899
and the area was sparse enough that
we were able to isolate an address.

29:51.020 --> 29:52.282
Zapata, why are you...

29:52.284 --> 29:53.631
<i>I understand why you called Reade,</i>

29:53.633 --> 29:56.114
but I want you to know
that you can trust me, too.

29:58.008 --> 29:59.708
Please don't give up on me.

30:00.544 --> 30:02.044
I haven't.

30:04.015 --> 30:05.215
Do you have a pen?

30:10.116 --> 30:12.084
Okay... thanks.

30:13.337 --> 30:15.205
Hey.

30:15.207 --> 30:17.369
Be careful. All right?

30:18.612 --> 30:19.912
Before Reade met you,

30:19.914 --> 30:23.516
he would never have
done something like this.

30:23.596 --> 30:25.689
You're a good influence on him.

35:58.728 --> 36:00.955
I know how much this case meant to you.

36:01.587 --> 36:05.996
Jane... you were never just a case to me.

36:07.887 --> 36:09.392
(sighs)

36:09.983 --> 36:11.849
What am I supposed to do now?

36:13.457 --> 36:14.537
I mean...

36:15.432 --> 36:16.604
ever since I came out of that bag,

36:16.675 --> 36:18.655
I've woken up with a purpose.

36:19.653 --> 36:21.122
I come here.

36:21.795 --> 36:24.709
- We save the world.
- (laughing)

36:25.665 --> 36:27.425
And then I go home.

36:29.315 --> 36:31.716
But what do I do when I wake up tomorrow?

36:34.088 --> 36:35.622
Whatever you want.

36:38.331 --> 36:40.198
Speaking of which...

36:42.088 --> 36:44.622
Now that we're...

36:44.689 --> 36:46.268
not working together...

36:46.305 --> 36:49.106
that sort of means I can do this.

37:03.762 --> 37:05.796
(both chuckle)

37:07.363 --> 37:08.830
(phone buzzing)

37:10.739 --> 37:12.806
- _
- Oh, there you go.

37:12.852 --> 37:16.363
Looks like Patterson can't find
her way through a bottle of bourbon.

37:17.217 --> 37:19.392
Wanna help her? With me?

37:19.486 --> 37:20.573
Sure.

37:20.636 --> 37:21.853
Okay.

37:22.630 --> 37:23.920
(chuckles nervously)

37:23.948 --> 37:25.338
(phone buzzing)

37:25.437 --> 37:27.131
Hey, are you coming?

37:27.214 --> 37:29.345
- _
- Yeah, I'll be there in a second.

37:29.347 --> 37:30.934
Just gonna take this.

37:36.255 --> 37:37.771
Yeah, it's Kurt.

37:37.773 --> 37:40.495
Kurt! Where's Kurt?

37:40.626 --> 37:41.791
He's in a lot of pain.

37:41.833 --> 37:44.907
<i>He refuses to take anything
until he talks to you.</i>

37:44.947 --> 37:46.130
(muttering)

37:46.240 --> 37:47.630
I think this is it.

37:47.702 --> 37:49.268
<i>You should call your sister.</i>

37:49.309 --> 37:51.357
Yeah, I'll be there as soon as I can.

37:56.119 --> 37:58.329
♪♪

37:58.331 --> 38:04.442
(indistinct chatter and laughter)

38:08.876 --> 38:10.710
(Reade) Even when I see the commercials...

38:10.712 --> 38:15.791
(indistinct chatter and laughter)

38:19.952 --> 38:21.319
(door opens)

38:22.345 --> 38:24.280
Oscar, it's over!

38:25.758 --> 38:27.993
Jane! What are y...

38:28.389 --> 38:30.062
What's over?

38:30.135 --> 38:31.312
(gasping)

38:31.403 --> 38:32.569
How did you...

38:34.139 --> 38:36.994
You did this to me. You set me up!

38:37.044 --> 38:39.811
No... no, if I...

38:39.875 --> 38:42.876
- I had no idea they were...
- That they were what?

38:42.986 --> 38:45.950
I didn't know. I didn't know.

38:46.015 --> 38:47.972
We took you in.

38:48.003 --> 38:49.467
We trusted you.

38:49.469 --> 38:51.018
I know... I know, and I'm sorry.

38:51.069 --> 38:53.164
And this is how you repay me?

38:53.211 --> 38:54.115
Please.

38:54.162 --> 38:56.674
You lied to me. You lied to all of us!

38:56.687 --> 38:58.599
Please, please don't do this.

38:58.663 --> 38:59.695
(gunshot)

39:05.163 --> 39:06.897
(thud)

39:09.370 --> 39:10.671
What did you do?

39:10.785 --> 39:13.206
- I'm sorry, this...
- What did you just do?!

39:13.246 --> 39:15.604
This isn't how we wanted it to happen.

39:15.675 --> 39:17.332
Come on, we gotta get you out of here.

39:17.334 --> 39:19.298
- I won't leave her.
- Taylor!

39:19.300 --> 39:20.731
Get out! Now!

39:20.789 --> 39:21.922
Now!

39:23.045 --> 39:25.079
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

39:25.276 --> 39:27.896
I won't let you hurt my team.

39:29.103 --> 39:30.137
Uhh!

39:30.952 --> 39:33.517
Lie still... please.

39:33.662 --> 39:35.922
(gasping)

39:35.975 --> 39:37.841
What did you do to us?

39:38.054 --> 39:40.402
Please... please, I didn't know.

39:40.404 --> 39:41.805
I didn't know.

39:41.807 --> 39:44.014
No, please, you can't die, please.

39:44.065 --> 39:46.622
I just wish I could be there

39:46.674 --> 39:48.249
to see his face

39:48.298 --> 39:51.555
when he finds out what you really are.

39:54.469 --> 39:55.688
(groaning)

39:59.130 --> 40:00.997
(crying)

40:08.178 --> 40:10.246
(sobbing)

40:17.705 --> 40:18.933
(Bill) Sarah?

40:19.019 --> 40:20.104
Where is she?

40:20.182 --> 40:21.434
Where is she?! Where is she?!

40:21.436 --> 40:23.005
(Weller) Dad!

40:23.034 --> 40:24.519
He's been calling for both of you.

40:24.550 --> 40:25.614
- Thank you.
- Kurt?

40:25.653 --> 40:27.100
- Hey. Hey, hey.
- Where is she?

40:27.131 --> 40:28.576
It's me.

40:28.615 --> 40:29.928
What'd I do?

40:29.959 --> 40:31.652
Where'd Sarah go?

40:31.722 --> 40:33.000
- Sarah's fine.
- Where'd Sarah go?

40:33.072 --> 40:34.750
Shh, Dad, she's coming.

40:34.803 --> 40:36.450
She'll be here.

40:36.452 --> 40:38.302
Thank God, thank God.

40:38.304 --> 40:41.929
- Relax, Dad.
- It was... it wasn't her.

40:42.010 --> 40:43.709
It wasn't her.

40:44.431 --> 40:46.265
Shh, relax, Dad.

40:47.506 --> 40:49.273
She still there?

40:49.552 --> 40:51.304
Under the fort?

40:51.956 --> 40:52.882
Is she...

40:52.945 --> 40:55.140
What are you talking about, Dad?

40:55.422 --> 40:57.687
I... I tried my...

40:57.867 --> 41:01.420
Tried my best, I did... best I could do.

41:01.556 --> 41:03.187
I'm sorry.

41:04.458 --> 41:07.426
I'm... (gasping)

41:07.745 --> 41:10.013
(whispering) She's under the fort, Kurt.

41:11.559 --> 41:13.860
Who's under the fort, Dad?

41:16.330 --> 41:18.420
It was an accident. I didn't mean to...

41:18.422 --> 41:21.123
I didn't... She was so small.

41:21.147 --> 41:22.780
- What?
- So...

41:22.852 --> 41:25.453
Who's under the fort, Dad?

41:25.598 --> 41:27.627
Taylor.

41:27.707 --> 41:29.073
Her body.

41:30.699 --> 41:34.029
She loved... loved it there.

41:34.218 --> 41:36.249
What are you talking about, Dad?

41:36.501 --> 41:38.460
I killed her, son.

41:39.779 --> 41:41.613
No.

41:41.757 --> 41:45.399
I... I killed Taylor Shaw.

41:45.437 --> 41:46.490
No!

41:48.347 --> 41:50.982
- No... Dad...
- Tell Sarah...

41:51.241 --> 41:53.208
that I did my best.

41:55.203 --> 41:57.304
Under the fort.

41:58.654 --> 42:00.655
(muttering)

42:09.220 --> 42:11.021
