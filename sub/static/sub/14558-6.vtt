WEBVTT

00:02.770 --> 00:05.373
(hoofbeats)

00:11.312 --> 00:14.115
(indistinct voice
on P.A. system)

00:28.496 --> 00:30.364
Hundred on Buckey's Folly
to win.

00:30.464 --> 00:34.535
Hundred? Seems like you're
on some streak, huh, Danny?

00:34.635 --> 00:36.637
-Sorry?
-Just keep picking winners.

00:36.737 --> 00:38.306
Yeah.

00:38.406 --> 00:39.173
Just, uh,

00:39.273 --> 00:40.208
tweaked my system a little.

00:40.308 --> 00:42.843
* ...Your hairdo, yeah

00:42.943 --> 00:44.378
* I'm glad you like my 'do

00:44.478 --> 00:47.148
* See we're lookin' pretty cool,
getcha *

00:51.819 --> 00:52.853
* Wait

00:52.953 --> 00:55.689
* Who's that guy

00:55.789 --> 00:56.957
* Just hangin' at your pad?

00:57.057 --> 00:58.259
* He's lookin' kinda blah

00:58.359 --> 01:00.194
* Yeah, you broke up,
that's too bad *

01:00.294 --> 01:02.196
* I guess it's fair

01:02.296 --> 01:05.599
* If he always pays the rent
and he doesn't get bent *

01:05.699 --> 01:08.736
* About sleepin' on the couch
when I'm there *

01:08.836 --> 01:10.771
* 'Cause I like you...

01:10.871 --> 01:11.905
(fanfare plays)

01:12.005 --> 01:13.107
ANNOUNCER:
The horses are on the track.

01:13.207 --> 01:17.445
* And I'm feelin'
so bohemian, like you *

01:17.545 --> 01:20.481
* Yeah, I like you,
yeah, I like you *

01:20.581 --> 01:21.615
* And I feel...

01:21.715 --> 01:22.950
(starter bell rings)

01:23.050 --> 01:24.585
ANNOUNCER:
And away they go!

01:27.555 --> 01:31.091
(cheering, indistinct voice
over intercom)

01:31.192 --> 01:32.426
ANNOUNCER:
...around the first turn.

01:32.526 --> 01:36.797
Buckey's Folly settles in
against the rail.

01:36.897 --> 01:38.532
* I'm getting wise

01:38.632 --> 01:42.336
* And I feel so bohemian
like you *

01:42.436 --> 01:44.071
* It's you that I want

01:44.172 --> 01:45.473
* So please

01:45.573 --> 01:50.077
* Just a casual, casual,
easy thing *

01:50.178 --> 01:53.181
* It isn't? It is for me

01:53.281 --> 01:56.217
ANNOUNCER: At the wire,
it's Buckey's Folly by a nose!

01:57.185 --> 02:00.621
* And I feel whoo!

02:02.856 --> 02:04.625
* Whoo-hoo, hoo

02:06.294 --> 02:08.529
* Whoo-hoo, hoo

02:09.930 --> 02:15.836
* Whoo-hoo, hoo,
whoo-hoo, hoo. *

02:18.472 --> 02:21.175
(a taiko drum pounding
rhythmically)

02:22.142 --> 02:24.478
Why are you doing that
right now?

02:24.578 --> 02:26.214
Did you know
that primitive societies

02:26.314 --> 02:28.182
believed in using
percussion

02:28.282 --> 02:30.050
as a means of communicating
with the dead?

02:30.150 --> 02:31.885
Are you drumming for someone
in particular?

02:31.985 --> 02:36.257
Yes. I'm drumming for the corpse
of my inspiration.

02:36.357 --> 02:40.361
And banging bongos worked
for Richard Feynman, so...

02:40.461 --> 02:42.430
Well, Feynman delighted
in making music.

02:42.530 --> 02:44.298
I never percuss for pleasure.

02:44.398 --> 02:46.334
Actually, I may have

02:46.434 --> 02:49.803
before me a problem
that cannot be drummed away.

02:50.738 --> 02:52.740
Larry, why don't you take
a relaxing soak

02:52.840 --> 02:54.007
in the Jacuzzi?

02:54.107 --> 02:55.276
No.

02:55.376 --> 02:57.378
When it comes to matters
of the heart,

02:57.478 --> 03:00.047
even Archimedes
preferred a cold shower.

03:00.147 --> 03:01.148
Megan?

03:01.249 --> 03:02.350
She's...

03:02.450 --> 03:06.554
She's exciting,
and she's beautiful.

03:06.654 --> 03:09.523
And this thing
that is between us--

03:09.623 --> 03:12.826
it's beginning
to affect my work.

03:12.926 --> 03:15.629
Well, what is going
on between you two?

03:15.729 --> 03:18.131
I... have not...

03:18.232 --> 03:20.734
the slightest idea.

03:20.834 --> 03:22.903
(two drumbeats)

03:23.003 --> 03:25.273
Well, you never work well
with emotional uncertainty.

03:25.373 --> 03:26.940
Do you think that's it?
Do you think

03:27.040 --> 03:29.377
that emotional uncertainty lies
at the heart of all this?

03:29.477 --> 03:31.912
Really, I'm not as familiar
with that side of you.

03:32.012 --> 03:35.249
No, nor it seems, am I.

03:40.321 --> 03:42.690
COLBY:
No real witnesses.

03:42.790 --> 03:44.825
Broad daylight here,
and no one saw a thing?

03:44.925 --> 03:46.026
Excuse us, folks.

03:46.126 --> 03:47.160
-Excuse me.
-Hey, Chuck.

03:47.261 --> 03:48.729
-How you doing, buddy?
-Hi, Don.

03:48.829 --> 03:51.231
Well, apparently, the long shot
was winning in a photo finish,

03:51.332 --> 03:53.000
and everybody
was focused

03:53.100 --> 03:54.201
-on the race.
-Uh-huh.

03:54.302 --> 03:57.104
Found this
on the body.

03:57.204 --> 03:59.273
-Something for Charlie, I guess.
-Oh, yeah?

03:59.373 --> 04:00.541
Yeah. Looks like a
pretty complicated

04:00.641 --> 04:02.175
betting scheme, and
there's race references

04:02.276 --> 04:03.977
-in the margins.
-Why'd they call us?

04:04.077 --> 04:05.379
COLBY:
Call came from inside.

04:05.479 --> 04:07.315
There's an agent
from O-C already has

04:07.415 --> 04:08.849
-an investigation underway.
-Right.

04:08.949 --> 04:10.618
Apparently, the track
ownership had ties

04:10.718 --> 04:13.220
to an organized
crime group.

04:13.321 --> 04:14.488
Agent Eppes.

04:15.456 --> 04:16.657
Hey, nice to see you.

04:16.757 --> 04:17.558
Yeah. What, uh...?

04:17.658 --> 04:18.258
Liz.

04:18.359 --> 04:20.528
Yeah. Liz Warner, right?

04:20.628 --> 04:22.029
You guys know each other, huh?

04:22.129 --> 04:24.765
Don was my Tactical Training
Instructor up at Quantico.

04:24.865 --> 04:27.200
What, now, you're heading
your own O-C unit?

04:27.301 --> 04:29.169
Uh, see what a good teacher
I am, Colby.

04:29.269 --> 04:30.971
Agent-in-charge took
a leave of absence,

04:31.071 --> 04:33.741
so I was asked to keep the
investigation up and running.

04:33.841 --> 04:36.577
All right, Agent-In-Charge,
come here. What have you got?

04:38.479 --> 04:39.647
Owner of the racetrack,

04:39.747 --> 04:41.315
Maurice Connors,
likes to gamble.

04:41.415 --> 04:42.850
-Uh-huh.
-Isn't very good at it.

04:42.950 --> 04:45.052
So, Ivan Tabakian
bought up his markers.

04:45.152 --> 04:47.054
-Oh, yeah? Ivan Tabakian?
-Mm-hmm.

04:47.154 --> 04:49.089
He's a major player. His crew's
into credit card scams,

04:49.189 --> 04:50.223
insurance fraud, and extortion.

04:50.324 --> 04:51.559
Right. No, I know
who he is.

04:51.659 --> 04:53.494
What-What have they got
going on here?

04:53.594 --> 04:54.795
Well, it's a
gambling scam,

04:54.895 --> 04:56.430
but we haven't put
our finger on it yet.

04:56.530 --> 04:58.198
What, you think
this kid's connected?

04:58.298 --> 05:00.968
We found that notebook
with the body.

05:01.068 --> 05:02.370
From the looks of it,

05:02.470 --> 05:03.937
seems like this kid,
Danny Roberts,

05:04.037 --> 05:05.172
may be helping Tabakian.

05:05.272 --> 05:07.675
I don't know.
Sounds a little thin to me.

05:07.775 --> 05:09.977
We also found some betting slips
on the body.

05:10.077 --> 05:11.912
Past ten days,
90 races.

05:12.012 --> 05:15.015
This kid Danny Roberts made more
than 30 bets.

05:15.115 --> 05:16.316
Yeah. So?

05:16.417 --> 05:18.852
And won every single time.

05:26.059 --> 05:29.497
Explain to me why the drum has
to be in my office.

05:29.597 --> 05:31.665
Because I had
to clear my floor.

05:31.765 --> 05:34.502
They're steaming the carpets
in the Physics Department.

05:34.602 --> 05:35.869
-Hey.
-CHARLIE: Perfect. Hey.

05:35.969 --> 05:37.638
You-You guys hungry?
Let's go grab so dinner.

05:37.738 --> 05:40.808
I can't get any dinner, but I
need you to look at this for me.

05:40.908 --> 05:42.543
-Would you? Just take a second?
-Okay, sure.

05:42.643 --> 05:44.978
Speaking of dinner...

05:45.078 --> 05:46.313
I know. I-I'm sorry.

05:46.414 --> 05:48.816
I-I just... I've been
so bogged down with...

05:48.916 --> 05:49.817
Work?

05:49.917 --> 05:50.984
(slight groan)

05:51.084 --> 05:52.052
Lawrence?

05:52.152 --> 05:53.921
Come take a
gander at this.

05:54.021 --> 05:55.155
It's a category-based

05:55.255 --> 05:57.491
approach to...
I don't know what,

05:57.591 --> 05:59.026
but it's a forecasting
system, right?

05:59.126 --> 06:02.095
-It's very sophisticated.
-LARRY: Oh, no, no, no.

06:02.195 --> 06:03.731
This is more
than sophisticated.

06:03.831 --> 06:05.999
You know what this
reminds me of?

06:06.099 --> 06:08.368
A topos approach
to Bach's music.

06:08.469 --> 06:10.237
I said "very sophisticated."

06:10.337 --> 06:11.204
Yes, you did.

06:11.304 --> 06:12.740
Where did this come from?

06:12.840 --> 06:14.442
It's from a-a guy
who was murdered at a racetrack.

06:14.542 --> 06:16.444
-A racetrack? -Yeah, and we
think he was using it

06:16.544 --> 06:17.611
to pick horses.

06:18.345 --> 06:20.313
Yeah, but if so,

06:20.414 --> 06:22.883
this whole approach
is counterintuitive.

06:22.983 --> 06:26.019
-Well, how so? -Well, if you're
trying to forecast a horse race,

06:26.119 --> 06:28.789
you're usually trying
to pick the winner, but, uh...?

06:28.889 --> 06:30.390
What?

06:30.491 --> 06:33.393
But these equations aren't
designed that way.

06:33.494 --> 06:35.328
How are they
designed?

06:35.429 --> 06:37.631
They're designed
to ignore the winner.

06:39.900 --> 06:41.969
Because he wasn't
picking the winner.

06:42.970 --> 06:45.573
He was picking
the second place horse.

06:56.016 --> 06:58.586
Hey, why design a system
to pick second place?

06:58.686 --> 06:59.987
How does that system

07:00.087 --> 07:02.490
let you pick 30 straight
winners in a row?

07:02.590 --> 07:03.691
-Doesn't make sense.
-(sighs)

07:03.791 --> 07:05.593
You know, if you're
gonna fix horse races

07:05.693 --> 07:07.027
on a regular basis,

07:07.127 --> 07:09.162
you have to pick horses
that are at least contenders.

07:09.262 --> 07:11.499
Right, because if the long shot
wins too many times,

07:11.599 --> 07:13.066
then, I mean, it's
gonna look strange.

07:13.166 --> 07:16.637
Right. So, you have
to pick a horse that could win.

07:16.737 --> 07:18.338
-Second.
-And then Tabakian would have to

07:18.438 --> 07:19.773
make sure that horse had help.

07:19.873 --> 07:22.075
COLBY:
Looks like somebody beat us

07:22.175 --> 07:23.343
to Danny Roberts' apartment.

07:23.443 --> 07:25.713
Landlord just called
LAPD with a break-in.

07:26.379 --> 07:27.548
I'll go.

07:29.850 --> 07:33.554
I heard about what happened,
so I let myself in.

07:33.654 --> 07:35.689
When's the last time
you were here?

07:35.789 --> 07:38.191
I dropped off the mail
yesterday.

07:38.291 --> 07:39.627
Can you tell
if anything's missing?

07:39.727 --> 07:44.598
I don't think so, but
I can't tell really.

07:44.698 --> 07:46.634
MEGAN:
And you live downstairs?

07:46.734 --> 07:48.201
WOMAN:
Mm-hmm.

07:48.301 --> 07:50.604
Any chance you might have
heard something last night?

07:50.704 --> 07:54.074
I took an Ambien
before I went to bed.

07:56.176 --> 07:57.645
I'm not much
help, am I?

07:57.745 --> 08:00.280
You have any idea who this is?

08:00.380 --> 08:01.849
Oh, Danny's
girlfriend.

08:01.949 --> 08:05.085
She did something with
computers, I think.

08:05.185 --> 08:06.887
Danny was crazy
about her.

08:06.987 --> 08:09.356
-Any idea where we might
find her? -Well, they spent

08:09.456 --> 08:10.558
most of
their time

08:10.658 --> 08:12.826
at her place
down in San Pedro.

08:24.504 --> 08:25.939
You had any lunch yet?

08:26.039 --> 08:27.074
Hmm?

08:27.174 --> 08:28.508
Is that a yes or a hmm?

08:28.609 --> 08:30.143
I'm sorry. What?

08:30.243 --> 08:32.345
I said,
do you want lunch?

08:32.445 --> 08:34.081
What are you looking at?

08:34.181 --> 08:35.482
It's a forecasting system.

08:35.583 --> 08:37.450
It's extremely complex.

08:37.551 --> 08:38.719
I just can't
seem to crack

08:38.819 --> 08:40.453
the logic
of this enabling argument.

08:40.554 --> 08:42.489
-All right, so take a break.
-I'll just...

08:42.590 --> 08:45.025
I'll make myself a nice
turkey sandwich later.

08:45.125 --> 08:45.993
-You sure?
-Mm-hmm.

08:46.093 --> 08:47.194
These raspberries
look delicious.

08:47.294 --> 08:48.662
I bought two boxes of them.

08:48.762 --> 08:50.230
Ever since that big thing
on the news about antioxidants,

08:50.330 --> 08:52.465
you can't find a blueberry,
but these raspberries--

08:52.566 --> 08:55.135
they're so cheap.

08:58.706 --> 09:00.373
What did you say?

09:00.473 --> 09:01.575
I said the raspberries--
they're so cheap.

09:01.675 --> 09:04.044
'Cause everyone
wants blueberries?

09:04.144 --> 09:06.179
And I thought
you weren't interested.

09:06.279 --> 09:07.848
Um...

09:07.948 --> 09:09.717
I got to go check
on something.

09:09.817 --> 09:11.418
I got to go find Don,

09:11.518 --> 09:13.787
so I'm gonna be home
later for dinner.

09:13.887 --> 09:14.888
Okay.

09:14.988 --> 09:17.658
But I'm going out for dinner.

09:17.758 --> 09:21.629
So I, uh, did a tour
in Washington.

09:21.729 --> 09:23.463
Good for the resume.

09:23.563 --> 09:25.966
Oh, yeah? What?
You miss kicking ass?

09:26.066 --> 09:27.134
(laughs)

09:27.234 --> 09:29.536
Oh, you only think that
because you taught me how.

09:29.637 --> 09:31.071
Hey, you were
a wild girl.

09:31.171 --> 09:32.205
I mean, if I recall,

09:32.305 --> 09:34.908
you had a bit of an issue
with adrenaline, right?

09:35.008 --> 09:37.978
I like to think it's more
of a hobby than an issue.

09:38.078 --> 09:41.048
Uh-huh. Now, how'd you
stumble onto this case?

09:41.148 --> 09:42.883
Well, we were running
a surveillance

09:42.983 --> 09:46.586
on a a midlevel supplier linked
to a Salvadorian drug cartel.

09:46.687 --> 09:50.057
He liked coming to the track,
so we came with him.

09:50.157 --> 09:52.159
What? That's where
you found Tabakian?

09:52.259 --> 09:55.796
Yeah, we're thinking the drugs
and him can't be a coincidence,

09:55.896 --> 09:58.699
but so far, we've never seen
any product at the track.

09:58.799 --> 10:01.534
Now, just tell me if this
owner guy... Is he cooperating?

10:01.635 --> 10:02.836
-Maurice Connors? No.
-Oh?

10:02.936 --> 10:05.138
Track's a cash cow,
so, long as it is,

10:05.238 --> 10:07.407
he figures Tabakian's just
gonna keep him around.

10:07.507 --> 10:08.842
Hey.

10:08.942 --> 10:11.544
You know, we could shake
things up for him with Tabakian.

10:11.645 --> 10:12.746
You know?

10:12.846 --> 10:14.648
Risky game
you like to play.

10:14.748 --> 10:17.350
I like to think of
it more as a hobby.

10:19.452 --> 10:20.420
So that's him.

10:20.520 --> 10:22.756
How you wanna play this?

10:22.856 --> 10:24.992
Uh, well, you lead.

10:25.092 --> 10:27.127
I'll shake.

10:27.961 --> 10:30.197
WARNER:
Mr. Connors. FBI.

10:30.297 --> 10:32.399
We'd like to talk to you
about what happened yesterday.

10:32.499 --> 10:33.801
-I don't know anything about it.
-You don't know anything

10:33.901 --> 10:35.703
about a murder
at your racetrack?

10:35.803 --> 10:37.705
Well, I'm aware
of what happened,

10:37.805 --> 10:39.072
but I didn't know the kid.

10:39.172 --> 10:41.574
Really? 'Cause according
to some of your tellers,

10:41.675 --> 10:42.910
he was a regular.

10:43.010 --> 10:44.311
We have a lot of regulars.

10:44.411 --> 10:46.246
Yeah, how many of them
are stabbed during the races?

10:46.346 --> 10:48.849
You're suggesting his death

10:48.949 --> 10:50.684
had something to do
with my racetrack?

10:50.784 --> 10:54.087
I don't know, maybe with
the track's new management?

10:54.187 --> 10:56.323
New management?

10:56.423 --> 10:58.191
Yeah, Ivan Tabakian.
You know anything about him?

10:58.291 --> 11:00.627
I don't think I should
answer any more questions.

11:00.728 --> 11:03.230
You haven't answered any yet.

11:03.330 --> 11:05.032
(phone rings)

11:05.132 --> 11:06.399
Eppes.

11:07.534 --> 11:08.869
Yeah, all right,
we're on our way.

11:08.969 --> 11:10.037
Hey, Liz, we gotta go.

11:10.137 --> 11:12.005
You know, doesn't really matter

11:12.105 --> 11:13.606
if you answer our questions.

11:13.707 --> 11:16.409
'Cause all
Tabakian's gonna hear

11:16.509 --> 11:19.412
is that you were talking
to the FBI.

11:20.948 --> 11:23.717
DON: Thanks for all your help,
Mr. Connors.

11:23.817 --> 11:26.820
We'll be seeing you.

11:33.861 --> 11:36.429
Got the dump
on Danny Roberts's phone.

11:36.529 --> 11:37.898
Anything good?

11:37.998 --> 11:40.768
Yeah, past month, he's only
called two numbers regularly--

11:40.868 --> 11:43.603
one is a San Pedro exchange,
probably his girlfriend.

11:43.703 --> 11:45.138
Yeah? Did you
get her name?

11:45.238 --> 11:46.406
And an address.

11:46.506 --> 11:49.642
Plug that in to your fancy
little nav system in your Acura.

11:49.743 --> 11:51.211
Oh, don't play...

11:51.311 --> 11:52.145
What about the other one?

11:52.245 --> 11:54.514
It's an off-track
betting place.

11:54.614 --> 11:55.949
Palomar OTB.

11:56.049 --> 11:58.151
That sounds good.
What'd they say?

11:58.251 --> 11:58.952
I didn't call them.

11:59.052 --> 12:00.253
Didn't really
seem important.

12:00.353 --> 12:04.524
(laughs):
That was almost funny, Granger.

12:04.624 --> 12:05.793
Come on,
what did they say?

12:05.893 --> 12:07.761
Transferred me over
to legal affairs.

12:07.861 --> 12:09.129
They said they're
happy to cooperate.

12:09.229 --> 12:10.931
Soon as I produce
a subpoena.

12:11.031 --> 12:13.700
(groans):
Let's go see the girlfriend.

12:13.801 --> 12:16.036
So I think I know
why Danny Roberts

12:16.136 --> 12:18.806
was focused on picking
second place finishers.

12:18.906 --> 12:20.207
He designed a system

12:20.307 --> 12:22.575
that identifies arbitrage
opportunities.

12:22.675 --> 12:23.743
What does that mean?

12:23.844 --> 12:25.345
It means he was looking
for bargains.

12:25.445 --> 12:26.379
Bargains?

12:26.479 --> 12:28.615
Racetracks use
pari-mutuel betting systems

12:28.715 --> 12:31.418
where market forces
determine the odds.

12:31.518 --> 12:33.120
It was actually invented

12:33.220 --> 12:34.822
by a French perfume maker,
uh, in the 1800s...

12:34.922 --> 12:36.323
All right, Charlie, just...

12:36.423 --> 12:37.724
Okay.

12:37.825 --> 12:40.227
In pari-mutuel betting,
the odds fluctuate

12:40.327 --> 12:41.929
according to how much
is wagered on a horse.

12:42.029 --> 12:43.496
So it's like kind
of like an auction

12:43.596 --> 12:46.299
where the more people there are
that want to buy something,

12:46.399 --> 12:48.902
-the more expensive it becomes.
-And sold!

12:49.002 --> 12:52.305
In horse racing, more expensive
translates to lower odds.

12:52.405 --> 12:53.740
So, the lower the odds,

12:53.841 --> 12:55.943
the smaller the return
on the bet.

12:56.043 --> 12:57.210
So the favorite is just a horse

12:57.310 --> 12:58.611
with the most amount
of money bet?

12:58.711 --> 12:59.612
That's exactly it.

12:59.712 --> 13:01.248
And so many people are focused

13:01.348 --> 13:02.249
on picking the winner,

13:02.349 --> 13:03.851
there's an active
exchange of information

13:03.951 --> 13:05.685
going on about the favorite.

13:05.785 --> 13:07.487
But we're dealing
with a horse here

13:07.587 --> 13:09.222
that no one's really
paying attention to, so...

13:09.322 --> 13:11.992
And it can also be
a highly inefficient market.

13:12.092 --> 13:14.361
That inefficiency
creates a situation

13:14.461 --> 13:16.964
where the potential for reward
outweighs the risk.

13:17.064 --> 13:18.932
Those are the opportunities
that Roberts was betting on.

13:19.032 --> 13:20.200
But that still
doesn't explain

13:20.300 --> 13:22.535
how Roberts won
30 straight bets, right?

13:22.635 --> 13:24.838
No, you're right, it doesn't.

13:24.938 --> 13:26.706
I mean,
something must've changed,

13:26.806 --> 13:28.341
you know,
whether it was in his system,

13:28.441 --> 13:29.142
or at the track.

13:29.242 --> 13:30.610
Right, enough to
get him killed.

13:30.710 --> 13:33.947
And in order to determine that,
I need data on those races

13:34.047 --> 13:36.316
so I can compare his system
to the most recent results.

13:36.416 --> 13:37.951
How recent?

13:38.051 --> 13:41.321
Just, like, you know,
the races in the past year.

13:42.555 --> 13:44.224
Yeah, welcome
to my world.

13:44.324 --> 13:45.558
(taps rhythmically

13:48.228 --> 13:51.031
WOMAN: I write software
for an IT company.

13:51.131 --> 13:53.400
It's freelance,
so I mostly work out of home.

13:53.500 --> 13:57.370
Danny always used to stop by
after the races, and,

13:57.470 --> 13:58.638
when he didn't show up....

13:58.738 --> 14:01.108
Can you think of anybody who
might've wanted to hurt him?

14:01.208 --> 14:05.112
No.

14:05.212 --> 14:07.915
I'm sorry.

14:11.418 --> 14:14.587
How about if I give the whole
"just us girls" thing a try?

14:14.687 --> 14:15.755
All right.

14:15.855 --> 14:17.157
I'll call the office,

14:17.257 --> 14:19.792
check on the status
of the subpoena for the OTB.

14:19.893 --> 14:21.494
Good luck.
Thanks.

14:21.594 --> 14:23.463
(phone pad beeping)

14:30.037 --> 14:32.772
Had you guys
set a date yet?

14:32.872 --> 14:34.541
Next spring.

14:34.641 --> 14:35.742
(chuckles)

14:35.842 --> 14:37.410
We were kind of
an odd pair.

14:37.510 --> 14:41.648
Danny was outgoing,
and I was more the geek.

14:41.748 --> 14:42.782
Hmm.

14:42.882 --> 14:46.486
I got something similar
going on myself.

14:46.586 --> 14:48.788
I just don't understand
how this could have happened.

14:48.888 --> 14:52.559
Do you know if Danny
had an argument

14:52.659 --> 14:53.860
with someone at the track?

14:53.961 --> 14:55.929
He didn't even talk
to anybody at the track.

14:56.029 --> 14:57.730
He was too focused
on working his system.

14:57.830 --> 15:01.368
Do you think he could have been
involved in fixing horse races?

15:01.468 --> 15:05.973
Agent Reeves, most months
I had to pay Danny's rent.

15:06.073 --> 15:08.875
If he was cheating,
wouldn't he be winning?

15:08.976 --> 15:10.910
He was winning.

15:11.011 --> 15:13.546
30 bets this week.

15:17.684 --> 15:19.219
So maybe this Danny Roberts kid

15:19.319 --> 15:21.154
was keeping the girlfriend
in the dark.

15:21.254 --> 15:23.890
She was totally surprised
about the winnings.

15:23.991 --> 15:25.258
WARNER: I don't know.
Wouldn't be the first time

15:25.358 --> 15:26.793
a guy tried to hide money
from his girl.

15:26.893 --> 15:27.961
I'm with you,

15:28.061 --> 15:29.529
but the way the landlady
spoke about them,

15:29.629 --> 15:32.299
young couple in love,
it's not really adding up.

15:32.399 --> 15:35.235
This thing isn't adding up
in a big way.

15:35.335 --> 15:37.804
Turns out he was hiding more
than just 30 bets from her.

15:37.904 --> 15:39.572
That's the results
of the subpoena

15:39.672 --> 15:42.242
from Danny Roberts's
account at the Palomar OTB.

15:42.342 --> 15:46.046
He set up the account a couple
weeks ago and he placed one bet.

15:46.146 --> 15:47.080
-What, Pick Six?
-Yeah.

15:47.180 --> 15:48.448
What is a Pick Six?

15:48.548 --> 15:50.083
You have to pick the winner
in six straight races.

15:50.183 --> 15:52.652
It's basically like
winning the lottery,

15:52.752 --> 15:54.087
and he just did it
five days ago.

15:54.187 --> 15:55.388
-Yeah, what did he get?
-Half a mil.

15:55.488 --> 15:57.357
Oh, well, there's a lot
of motive for someone.

15:57.457 --> 15:59.859
Or not.
I just talked to them.

15:59.959 --> 16:02.429
They told me that he never
cashed the ticket.

16:09.269 --> 16:10.770
So you know Don
pretty well, huh?

16:10.870 --> 16:12.739
You know what
Quantico's like.

16:12.839 --> 16:14.674
Yeah, I bet he was a pretty
tough instructor, huh?

16:14.774 --> 16:16.843
He was just
back from the field.

16:16.943 --> 16:17.844
Fugitive hunting?

16:17.944 --> 16:19.379
Yeah.

16:19.479 --> 16:21.848
And still getting used
to being back in civilization.

16:21.948 --> 16:24.517
Any reason you're asking?

16:24.617 --> 16:26.419
I just screwed
something up a while back.

16:27.287 --> 16:29.289
Well, I can tell you this much.

16:29.389 --> 16:31.924
Fact you're still here,
means something.

16:32.025 --> 16:34.394
But I wouldn't count
on being forgiven twice.

16:36.163 --> 16:39.099
So Danny Roberts
picks six winners

16:39.199 --> 16:42.269
for half a million dollars,
but doesn't cash the ticket?

16:42.369 --> 16:43.936
Just doesn't make any sense.

16:44.037 --> 16:46.139
His girlfriend said he
was borrowing rent money.

16:46.239 --> 16:48.141
Sounds like he was hiding
the winnings from someone.

16:48.241 --> 16:51.078
That bet, too, maybe.

16:51.178 --> 16:52.479
What do you mean?

16:52.579 --> 16:53.846
Roberts is down at the track
every day, right?

16:53.946 --> 16:56.283
So why place a bet
through an online OTB

16:56.383 --> 16:57.784
when you could
do it in person?

16:57.884 --> 16:59.519
Because he couldn't.

16:59.619 --> 17:00.520
The tellers all knew him.

17:00.620 --> 17:02.489
So maybe he wasn't
working for Tabakian?

17:02.589 --> 17:05.658
Which might explain why
he's dead right now.

17:06.693 --> 17:09.496
CHARLIE:
Six winners.

17:09.596 --> 17:10.963
Six consecutive winners.

17:11.064 --> 17:12.465
A streak
of 30 wins.

17:12.565 --> 17:15.635
All from a system designed
to pick a second place horse?

17:15.735 --> 17:16.636
Does it make sense?

17:16.736 --> 17:19.706
No. In theory, it should
never have happened.

17:19.806 --> 17:21.074
Hey, you guys.

17:21.174 --> 17:22.442
What are you
two up to now?

17:22.542 --> 17:25.945
We have been dealt a paradox
of theory versus praxis.

17:26.045 --> 17:27.647
Is that bad?

17:27.747 --> 17:30.450
We're attempting
to decipher a betting system

17:30.550 --> 17:33.153
that's achieved something that
it just wasn't designed to do.

17:33.253 --> 17:34.454
And currently,
we stand at the abyss,

17:34.554 --> 17:36.956
having reached the
limits of our knowledge

17:37.056 --> 17:38.525
of the sport of Kings.

17:38.625 --> 17:39.859
Oh, racetrack. Huh?

17:39.959 --> 17:40.993
Do you know about horse racing?

17:41.094 --> 17:42.162
Well, before I met your mother,

17:42.262 --> 17:44.297
I used to hang out
at the track, uh, a lot.

17:44.397 --> 17:46.933
Really? I would never have
pegged you for a railbird.

17:47.033 --> 17:48.868
(laughs):
Yeah, well, I...

17:48.968 --> 17:50.203
I got hooked
when I was a kid.

17:50.303 --> 17:52.339
I-I knew nothing about this.

17:52.439 --> 17:54.141
Like I said, it was before
I met your mother.

17:54.241 --> 17:56.509
I take it Margaret was not
a fan of the horses.

17:56.609 --> 17:59.146
Uh, no, she was a big
fan of college funds.

17:59.246 --> 18:01.481
Hey, by the way, if
we leave right now,

18:01.581 --> 18:04.083
we can make it to the track
for, uh, morning workouts.

18:04.184 --> 18:05.218
Yeah, great. Larry?

18:05.318 --> 18:06.919
No. Count me out.

18:07.019 --> 18:08.388
Horses going around a track,

18:08.488 --> 18:12.091
it all puts me in mind of
an acute childhood trauma.

18:12.192 --> 18:13.593
-Really? What happened?
-I was nine.

18:13.693 --> 18:15.662
I was with my parents
at a county fair,

18:15.762 --> 18:16.996
and I saw a man get crushed.

18:17.096 --> 18:18.498
Wow.

18:18.598 --> 18:19.666
By a horse?

18:19.766 --> 18:21.168
Horses, actually.

18:21.268 --> 18:23.603
Yeah, it was a merry-go-round.

18:28.675 --> 18:29.776
Let's go, Dad.

18:29.876 --> 18:31.211
Yeah, coming.

18:39.018 --> 18:40.720
-Hey.
-Hey.

18:40.820 --> 18:41.921
Want some coffee?

18:42.021 --> 18:43.190
Yeah, sure.

18:43.290 --> 18:45.792
So, we may be right
about Danny Roberts

18:45.892 --> 18:48.995
not working for Tabakian,
but so far, I got nothing.

18:49.095 --> 18:51.964
Roberts bounced a check
here and there,

18:52.064 --> 18:55.067
but there's no reason for him
to hide money from a creditor.

18:55.168 --> 18:57.270
Let's see what Charlie
comes up with.

18:58.938 --> 19:00.072
Back at Quantico,

19:00.173 --> 19:01.941
you never really talked
about your brother.

19:02.041 --> 19:03.676
-No?
-As I recall,

19:03.776 --> 19:06.646
you never really talked
about yourself with anyone.

19:06.746 --> 19:07.680
Thanks.

19:07.780 --> 19:08.681
Well...

19:08.781 --> 19:12.018
I wasn't in a really good way
back then.

19:12.118 --> 19:13.353
Well, I hear you may
be mellowing with age.

19:13.453 --> 19:16.423
(laughs):
Well, let's hope so, right?

19:16.523 --> 19:18.425
I've just heard
some things about you

19:18.525 --> 19:20.059
and a certain
federal prosecutor.

19:20.159 --> 19:21.428
Oh, yeah, did you?

19:21.528 --> 19:23.430
Don Eppes with the same woman
for more than a week.

19:23.530 --> 19:24.864
I don't know,
some might call it progress.

19:24.964 --> 19:28.435
Yeah, I mean, I guess it depends
who you ask, right?

19:29.269 --> 19:30.903
So, this kid,
Danny Roberts,

19:31.003 --> 19:35.041
he's got no debt, he's not
working for Tabakian...

19:35.141 --> 19:36.376
why does he get whacked?

19:36.476 --> 19:39.779
You know, we had a
witness, a trainer.

19:39.879 --> 19:41.381
He'd been doping horses.

19:41.481 --> 19:42.615
Injecting an
antidiuretic

19:42.715 --> 19:44.183
-so a horse would retain water,
-Uh-huh.

19:44.284 --> 19:45.585
carry excess weight.

19:45.685 --> 19:48.154
He was all set to testify
for the grand jury.

19:48.255 --> 19:49.789
But what,
Tabakian found out?

19:49.889 --> 19:51.491
He had the guy's hands
nailed to a stall,

19:51.591 --> 19:54.627
brought a horse in and had
the guy kicked to death.

19:54.727 --> 19:57.196
Pff. Nice.

19:59.031 --> 20:01.100
CHARLIE:
So Danny Roberts's system

20:01.200 --> 20:03.403
was designed to pick the
second place horse. Why?

20:03.503 --> 20:06.239
Because there's a bias in
the betting on second place.

20:06.339 --> 20:08.140
If you know what you're doing,
you can exploit that.

20:08.241 --> 20:09.276
Now how do you know?

20:09.376 --> 20:10.743
Railbird, remember?

20:10.843 --> 20:14.281
It took me half a day to work
that out mathematically.

20:14.381 --> 20:15.982
Well, you should've
come to me sooner.

20:16.082 --> 20:17.784
Yeah. So,
handicapping.

20:17.884 --> 20:20.987
We're trying to predict
how a horse will run

20:21.087 --> 20:22.722
at the distance
of the current race.

20:22.822 --> 20:24.857
Exactly. But you have
to consider past performances,

20:24.957 --> 20:29.128
type of horse, track conditions,
the experience of the jockey.

20:29.228 --> 20:30.797
See, I'd even take it
a few steps further.

20:30.897 --> 20:33.700
I would. I'd factor an average
race speed, interval pace,

20:33.800 --> 20:35.602
-wind speed, time of day,
assigned weights, -Oh, Charlie.

20:35.702 --> 20:37.136
-gate slot, sun position...
-Charlie...

20:37.236 --> 20:39.038
Charlie, you can't account
for everything.

20:39.138 --> 20:40.139
You can, if you
can think of everything.

20:40.239 --> 20:41.574
Ah.

20:41.674 --> 20:43.209
But this is what's
confusing here. Look.

20:43.310 --> 20:44.677
It's a probability adjustment

20:44.777 --> 20:45.878
describing a dynamic system
with hidden states.

20:45.978 --> 20:48.247
Charlie. Railbird. Railbird.

20:48.348 --> 20:50.249
It's just something
that's not readily apparent

20:50.350 --> 20:51.751
to other bettors.

20:51.851 --> 20:54.754
In my experience, handicappers
know practically everything.

20:54.854 --> 20:57.690
That is, unless you want to take
cheating into consideration.

20:59.526 --> 21:01.661
Well, that's just it, isn't it?

21:01.761 --> 21:02.329
What?

21:02.429 --> 21:03.596
Cheating is the behavior

21:03.696 --> 21:06.533
that Roberts designed
this algorithm for.

21:09.135 --> 21:10.937
(clears throat)

21:11.037 --> 21:12.104
Who are you calling?

21:12.204 --> 21:13.406
Your brother.
Next thing you'll know,

21:13.506 --> 21:15.575
you're going to tell me
you gotta call Don.

21:16.609 --> 21:19.579
Thanks.

21:31.758 --> 21:32.892
Oh, hey, Megan.

21:32.992 --> 21:33.893
May I come in?

21:33.993 --> 21:36.696
Uh, yeah, yeah, uh... um...

21:36.796 --> 21:37.764
Just, um...

21:37.864 --> 21:39.065
(chuckles)

21:39.165 --> 21:40.166
It's a little unexpected.

21:40.266 --> 21:41.634
I know. I'm sorry.

21:41.734 --> 21:42.869
I really should
have, um, called.

21:42.969 --> 21:44.637
I just wasn't really
sure I was coming here

21:44.737 --> 21:45.938
until I was
already, um...

21:46.038 --> 21:47.374
here.

21:47.474 --> 21:49.809
I-It's-- Yeah, that's fine.

21:50.843 --> 21:52.445
And... Don said

21:52.545 --> 21:54.180
that Charlie and Alan
went to the track.

21:54.280 --> 21:55.314
You didn't go with?

21:55.415 --> 21:57.249
No, no, no, no.
Gambling on animals.

21:57.350 --> 21:58.951
That's a messy business.

21:59.051 --> 22:00.920
No, no, I much
prefer cards.

22:01.020 --> 22:03.590
There you have an appreciable
structure, you know,

22:03.690 --> 22:07.126
played out in a graded
tensor product space, so...

22:07.226 --> 22:08.127
Sounds like structure

22:08.227 --> 22:09.929
is pretty important to you.

22:10.029 --> 22:13.633
I'm sensing a-a more
than casual inquiry.

22:13.733 --> 22:17.537
Well, I think what's been
going on between us

22:17.637 --> 22:19.906
is pretty unstructured.

22:20.006 --> 22:21.441
(laughing):
Yeah.

22:21.541 --> 22:24.777
Look, we make baryogenesis
look tidy.

22:24.877 --> 22:27.213
(laughing):
I don't know what that means.

22:27.313 --> 22:28.615
Oh, I'm sorry.

22:28.715 --> 22:30.617
I-It's an asymmetry between
matter and anti-matter,

22:30.717 --> 22:33.453
which emerged shortly
after the Big Bang.

22:34.421 --> 22:37.023
It's-- Yeah, it's baryogenesis.

22:37.123 --> 22:38.324
I think I'm finding

22:38.425 --> 22:39.759
that, that things between us are

22:39.859 --> 22:44.063
maybe just, I don't know, um...

22:44.163 --> 22:46.733
just kind of a trifle free-form.

22:46.833 --> 22:48.768
I'm guessing that's why
you haven't called in a while.

22:48.868 --> 22:49.969
Well,

22:50.069 --> 22:52.439
you see, Megan, I-I'm just
finding this whole journey

22:52.539 --> 22:53.473
from I to us--

22:53.573 --> 22:54.941
it's just a
little more

22:55.041 --> 22:58.811
distracting than I
originally anticipated.

23:00.947 --> 23:01.848
(chuckles)

23:01.948 --> 23:02.815
And I would have guessed

23:02.915 --> 23:04.517
that a guy that
lives in his car

23:04.617 --> 23:06.786
wouldn't need that
much structure.

23:06.886 --> 23:09.989
There's few things better
organized than a 1931 Ford.

23:10.089 --> 23:11.824
(laughs):
Listen,

23:11.924 --> 23:14.293
I'm not, um,

23:14.393 --> 23:15.795
making any demands.

23:15.895 --> 23:18.431
No, and I'm not suggesting
that you are.

23:18.531 --> 23:19.966
But if you need a
little more structure,

23:20.066 --> 23:23.603
-I'm not necessarily opposed
to that. -You're not?

23:23.703 --> 23:26.873
Uh-uh, and if you can
get past the distraction,

23:26.973 --> 23:30.743
there's a Truffaut
retrospective this weekend.

23:30.843 --> 23:32.479
Okay.

23:32.579 --> 23:36.048
Yeah, let me just
check my planner.

23:36.148 --> 23:37.517
(giggles)

23:37.617 --> 23:39.519
(whispering):
I'll see you this weekend.

23:43.890 --> 23:47.660
Yeah, it looks--
it looks clear.

23:55.502 --> 23:57.637
So originally,
Roberts designed his system

23:57.737 --> 24:00.372
to pick second place finishers,
and then something changed.

24:00.473 --> 24:01.508
Yeah, cheating.

24:01.608 --> 24:02.642
-My idea.
-Mm-hmm.

24:02.742 --> 24:03.943
Right, a-and suddenly,

24:04.043 --> 24:05.912
the horses that should be
winning stopped winning,

24:06.012 --> 24:08.414
and that screws up his ability
to pick the runner-up.

24:08.515 --> 24:10.216
So then he makes an adjustment
because, well,

24:10.316 --> 24:13.520
he realizes that the outcomes
are consistently falling

24:13.620 --> 24:15.555
outside the range of
realistic probabilities.

24:16.856 --> 24:17.990
It's like
a weather report

24:18.090 --> 24:20.527
where the forecast calls
for a heat wave,

24:20.627 --> 24:22.529
and instead
there's a freak snowstorm.

24:22.629 --> 24:24.531
You know, once or twice,
that's anomalous.

24:24.631 --> 24:25.665
You can't predict
anything perfectly,

24:25.765 --> 24:27.233
but if that pattern
is persistent,

24:27.333 --> 24:28.535
you've got to assume

24:28.635 --> 24:30.570
that there are unknown factors
to consider.

24:30.670 --> 24:32.371
Unknown factors like cheating.

24:32.471 --> 24:33.773
CHARLIE:
See, Roberts retooled his system

24:33.873 --> 24:37.009
to account for those
fixed races, and presto.

24:37.109 --> 24:38.277
30 straight winners.

24:38.377 --> 24:40.412
So it proves it was a scam.

24:40.513 --> 24:41.748
Maybe it was the cheating
that got the guy killed.

24:41.848 --> 24:44.350
Yeah, he may be right.
I loaded all the race data

24:44.450 --> 24:45.552
onto my laptop,

24:45.652 --> 24:48.087
so I was able to run
every Pick Six winner

24:48.187 --> 24:51.023
-for the past six months through
Roberts' algorithm. -And?

24:51.123 --> 24:53.693
-A snowstorm in July. -Right, at
least for the past few months.

24:53.793 --> 24:55.127
I mean, five winners.

24:55.227 --> 24:56.362
Each of them won the Pick Six

24:56.462 --> 24:58.430
when the races were fixed.

24:58.531 --> 24:59.866
That's just not a coincidence.

25:04.837 --> 25:06.372
Granger.

25:06.472 --> 25:08.407
Hey, we got something
from Charlie.

25:08.507 --> 25:09.709
Tried to give you a call.

25:09.809 --> 25:11.010
Yeah,
I got your message.

25:12.579 --> 25:14.046
I was at Cal Sci.

25:14.146 --> 25:16.282
Ah, Larry.

25:18.685 --> 25:19.986
You're dying to ask,
aren't you?

25:20.086 --> 25:21.921
No.

25:22.021 --> 25:23.990
(chuckles)

25:24.090 --> 25:25.758
I think it's
the unpredictability.

25:25.858 --> 25:28.728
-I didn't ask.
-All right, you didn't ask.

25:28.828 --> 25:32.765
I do think, uh, you're a little
bit of an odd pair, but...

25:33.332 --> 25:35.501
Exactly.

25:35.602 --> 25:36.903
What do you see?

25:37.003 --> 25:39.505
Celia Martinez'
bank account.

25:39.606 --> 25:41.340
She's one of the
Pick Six winners

25:41.440 --> 25:42.474
Charlie linked to the cheating.

25:42.575 --> 25:43.743
Yeah.

25:43.843 --> 25:45.778
The last transaction is
to an Estate Trust.

25:46.979 --> 25:48.180
I think Celia Martinez is dead.

25:51.050 --> 25:53.085
-What are you doing?
-Just checking something.

25:53.185 --> 25:54.754
Social Security numbers

25:54.854 --> 25:55.955
of the other
Pick Six winners.

25:56.055 --> 25:59.025
Yeah.

25:59.125 --> 26:01.193
Wharton is dead?

26:07.033 --> 26:09.802
Look at this.
They're all dead.

26:15.875 --> 26:19.211
So, you got two overdoses,
a fatal hit-and-run...

26:19.311 --> 26:22.048
And the other two deaths were
caused by drowning and a fall.

26:22.148 --> 26:23.449
So all five deaths were
accidental?

26:23.549 --> 26:25.718
What are the odds of that?

26:25.818 --> 26:27.119
DON: About the same as all five
winning the Pick Six.

26:27.219 --> 26:30.122
All right, so let's look
at 'em as homicides.

26:30.222 --> 26:31.590
-Right?
-All right, I'll get into it

26:31.691 --> 26:32.625
with the Medical Examiner.

26:32.725 --> 26:34.761
Tabakian's got
to be behind this.

26:34.861 --> 26:35.995
Well, then, we
just connect him

26:36.095 --> 26:37.697
to the money.

26:37.797 --> 26:40.299
Or we just go
pick him up.

26:40.399 --> 26:41.433
Last time we were
this close,

26:41.533 --> 26:42.935
he killed my witness.

26:43.035 --> 26:46.673
We tip our hand early,
we only add to the body count.

26:55.581 --> 26:58.250
Thanks again for the use
of the tub, Alan.

26:58.350 --> 27:01.187
I'd say anytime, but
you might think I meant it.

27:01.287 --> 27:03.790
No, no, I promise I
won't make it a habit.

27:03.890 --> 27:05.958
I was kidding, Larry.

27:06.058 --> 27:07.193
You know
you're always welcome.

27:07.293 --> 27:08.895
-Anytime.
-Thanks.

27:08.995 --> 27:11.063
By the way, if you get tired of
that nomadic lifestyle of yours,

27:11.163 --> 27:12.564
I, um, I do happen
to have some,

27:12.665 --> 27:15.001
uh, brochures
of a condo development.

27:15.101 --> 27:16.669
They're really great properties.

27:16.769 --> 27:18.771
While back, I was thinking
of taking one myself.

27:18.871 --> 27:20.606
It's so funny you're
even mentioning this.

27:20.707 --> 27:21.774
Oh, really. How so?

27:21.874 --> 27:24.744
Because lately,
I have been rethinking

27:24.844 --> 27:27.780
some of my earlier assumptions
with regards to,

27:27.880 --> 27:29.515
you know,
pure intellectual endeavor.

27:29.615 --> 27:31.183
Ah.

27:31.283 --> 27:33.352
Oh, you figured out
that grown women won't make out

27:33.452 --> 27:34.687
in the backseats of cars, huh?

27:34.787 --> 27:36.889
I don't know, I just think
I may have lost touch

27:36.989 --> 27:40.259
with certain important aspects
of life in the real world.

27:40.359 --> 27:41.627
Plus...

27:41.728 --> 27:43.062
my car.

27:44.130 --> 27:45.998
No backseat.

27:47.834 --> 27:50.970
Let me get you
one of those brochures.

27:51.070 --> 27:53.572
All five victims cleared
out their accounts

27:53.672 --> 27:54.841
with a cashier's check.

27:54.941 --> 27:56.809
The checks were cashed
at banks overseas

27:56.909 --> 27:58.811
in Azerbaijan
and Armenia.

27:58.911 --> 28:01.547
Ugh, so I'm guessing the
accounts went nowhere?

28:01.647 --> 28:03.582
Ah, the money
is a dead end.

28:03.682 --> 28:05.084
We have five victims

28:05.184 --> 28:06.552
from five different
neighborhoods

28:06.652 --> 28:08.354
and five different
ethnicities.

28:08.454 --> 28:09.722
There's no common
denominator.

28:09.822 --> 28:11.090
Except Tabakian.

28:11.190 --> 28:12.992
He found them; we just
got to figure out how.

28:13.092 --> 28:14.260
Maybe...

28:14.360 --> 28:16.528
it's an employment thing,
a work connection.

28:16.628 --> 28:18.965
Raymond Wharton didn't
even have a job.

28:19.799 --> 28:21.801
Neither did Celia Martinez.

28:23.535 --> 28:24.771
That's it,
the unemployment office.

28:24.871 --> 28:25.805
It's two blocks away.

28:25.905 --> 28:27.439
It's quicker to walk.

28:32.478 --> 28:34.313
(knocks)

28:34.413 --> 28:37.116
Hey, so Don asked me if I could
connect the Pick Six winners

28:37.216 --> 28:39.385
to Tabakian, but so far,
we don't have enough data,

28:39.485 --> 28:41.120
and any data-
mining algorithm

28:41.220 --> 28:42.889
may require way
more information

28:42.989 --> 28:45.591
than we already
have, so it's like...

28:45.691 --> 28:46.658
Larry.

28:46.759 --> 28:47.927
Yeah.

28:48.027 --> 28:49.996
How much did you hear
of what I just said?

28:50.096 --> 28:51.597
You don't have enough data

28:51.697 --> 28:53.332
to connect the people
to your mob boss.

28:53.432 --> 28:54.834
Exactly.

28:56.335 --> 28:59.171
So concentrate on the data you
do have and maybe there's a way

28:59.271 --> 29:01.040
to connect them
through their bets.

29:02.875 --> 29:04.811
Larry, that's... brilliant.

29:04.911 --> 29:07.546
What is it with me
and structure?

29:07.646 --> 29:09.181
Do you find me
overly structured?

29:09.281 --> 29:11.417
I don't kn--
Why are you asking me?

29:11.517 --> 29:13.853
Just humor me here,
just answer this question.

29:15.687 --> 29:16.688
Well,

29:16.789 --> 29:20.326
on the one hand,
you don't have a home;

29:20.426 --> 29:21.327
and on the other,

29:21.427 --> 29:23.495
you eat monochromatically.

29:23.595 --> 29:25.431
Look, do you remember
when I was

29:25.531 --> 29:29.535
an undergraduate in
your quantum physics class?

29:29.635 --> 29:30.669
Yes, how could
I ever forget?

29:30.769 --> 29:32.738
That class
was the first place

29:32.839 --> 29:34.306
that I learned
about the paradoxes

29:34.406 --> 29:37.009
between quantum mechanics
and general relativity.

29:37.109 --> 29:38.911
Yeah, and we're still
in search of a theory

29:39.011 --> 29:41.713
to unify the two in a single
explanation of gravity.

29:41.814 --> 29:43.182
But w-where were you
headed with this?

29:43.282 --> 29:47.319
There's no unifying theory
for Larry Fleinhardt.

29:48.354 --> 29:50.022
And I think Megan

29:50.122 --> 29:54.961
could very well be...
your own private gravity.

29:56.996 --> 29:58.998
I have records
for all five of them,

29:59.098 --> 30:01.067
but they all went
to different job centers.

30:01.167 --> 30:02.234
MEGAN:
Can you access that information

30:02.334 --> 30:04.904
-from here?
-Sure. Everything's linked.

30:05.004 --> 30:07.173
I can pull up a list of
companies that each of them

30:07.273 --> 30:08.540
interviewed with.

30:10.109 --> 30:12.811
Wait, can you scroll
back up for a second?

30:13.612 --> 30:15.147
Do you see
something?

30:15.247 --> 30:16.983
Yeah.

30:17.083 --> 30:18.317
Take a look at this.

30:19.451 --> 30:20.752
They all interviewed

30:20.853 --> 30:22.088
at the racetrack?

30:22.188 --> 30:24.023
Can you see
who they talked to there?

30:24.123 --> 30:26.325
Uh, that sort of thing would
only be in the original files.

30:26.425 --> 30:28.594
So, let's look
at the original files.

30:28.694 --> 30:35.001
It takes five business days
to process a request.

30:41.773 --> 30:43.842
-Hey, all right, so...
-Where you been?

30:43.943 --> 30:45.711
Hold on, hold on, we got here
as fast as we could.

30:45.811 --> 30:47.213
Just relax.
What's going on?

30:47.313 --> 30:48.747
Look, there wasn't enough data.

30:48.847 --> 30:50.316
Larry said, "Try to use other
data." I said, "Use other data?"

30:50.416 --> 30:51.951
-I-I reworked the algorithm,
you know. -Shh.

30:52.051 --> 30:53.519
-Just slow down, just slow down
-I made improvements

30:53.619 --> 30:54.853
to Roberts' algorithm.

30:54.954 --> 30:56.422
I took a look
at all the racing results

30:56.522 --> 30:58.057
for the past two years,
and you know,

30:58.157 --> 30:59.959
not just the Pick Six.
I looked at all the betting.

31:00.059 --> 31:01.193
-And?
-They were fixing races

31:01.293 --> 31:03.129
way before they fixed
the Pick Six.

31:03.229 --> 31:05.131
-What do you mean?
-They started

31:05.231 --> 31:06.465
by fixing races,
like, once a month.

31:06.565 --> 31:08.134
Then twice a month,
then more frequently.

31:08.234 --> 31:10.302
Look, there is
a regular progression

31:10.402 --> 31:11.870
-to this pattern.
-Charlie, we already know

31:11.971 --> 31:12.972
they were fixing races.

31:13.072 --> 31:14.040
Right, but now,

31:14.140 --> 31:15.507
now we know
when they were doing it.

31:15.607 --> 31:16.842
I mean, Don, don't you see?

31:16.943 --> 31:19.145
If, if they killed
those five Pick Six winners

31:19.245 --> 31:21.613
right after they got their
money, then what's to stop them

31:21.713 --> 31:23.115
from killing
all the other winners

31:23.215 --> 31:25.484
of all the other
fixed races?

31:25.584 --> 31:26.718
-That would be...
-18...

31:26.818 --> 31:27.987
other murders.

31:28.087 --> 31:29.621
Charlie, that's
a lot of bodies.

31:29.721 --> 31:30.756
I mean, look, we'd know

31:30.856 --> 31:32.992
if these guys killed
that many people.

31:33.092 --> 31:35.227
Well, not if they staged
the deaths as accidents.

31:42.468 --> 31:44.303
So look at this.
Here's another one.

31:44.403 --> 31:46.038
Not deceased.

31:46.138 --> 31:48.074
I'm starting to think we're
not looking at more bodies.

31:48.174 --> 31:49.708
All right, so what is it?

31:49.808 --> 31:50.909
I mean,
first of all,

31:51.010 --> 31:52.211
we're not looking
at 18 different people.

31:52.311 --> 31:54.480
We're looking at six guys
who won a lot of bets

31:54.580 --> 31:57.083
over the course of the 18 dates
that Charlie gave us.

31:57.183 --> 32:00.019
-Six guys. -And they all have
to be connected to Tabakian.

32:00.119 --> 32:01.087
All right, look, why don't
you just start checking

32:01.187 --> 32:02.754
into their backgrounds?

32:02.854 --> 32:04.056
All right.

32:13.099 --> 32:14.200
Give up on the water cure?

32:14.300 --> 32:15.801
Yeah, it wasn't
really working.

32:15.901 --> 32:17.669
-Plus, I ran out of hot water.
-Oh.

32:17.769 --> 32:20.006
Here I am, once again
monopolizing your bathtub.

32:20.106 --> 32:21.007
I apologize.

32:21.107 --> 32:22.908
You take as much
time as you need.

32:23.009 --> 32:25.111
Thank you.

32:25.211 --> 32:26.312
-You all right?
-Yeah, it's just

32:26.412 --> 32:28.847
the efforts I've made
to simplify my life

32:28.947 --> 32:30.782
have started to complicate it.

32:30.882 --> 32:32.351
You know, not long ago,
I was, um,

32:32.451 --> 32:34.620
I was worried
about Charlie, you know.

32:34.720 --> 32:35.887
About him having a normal life.

32:35.988 --> 32:37.323
That's a bit of a challenge,

32:37.423 --> 32:39.225
given the circumstances
of his genius.

32:39.325 --> 32:40.592
Yeah, that's
what I realized.

32:40.692 --> 32:42.294
So I thought maybe, uh,

32:42.394 --> 32:44.863
normal for him
was not on target.

32:44.963 --> 32:47.899
And perhaps for you,

32:48.000 --> 32:49.335
-simple is off the mark.
-(chuckles)

32:49.435 --> 32:50.869
I've never known
life to be simple.

32:50.969 --> 32:52.871
-CHARLIE: Larry?
-Yeah, in here.

32:52.971 --> 32:55.041
Hey, I need you to
look at something.

32:55.141 --> 32:56.608
Why are you both in here?

32:56.708 --> 32:57.943
Okay, what is it I'm looking at?

32:58.044 --> 33:00.079
That's my question.
Look closely.

33:00.179 --> 33:01.747
If you didn't know
that this was evidence

33:01.847 --> 33:03.349
in an FBI investigation,

33:03.449 --> 33:05.084
what would you
say that it was?

33:05.184 --> 33:07.219
I'm sorry, what is it
you're asking?

33:07.319 --> 33:08.920
Ignore the context of
the murder, you know what,

33:09.021 --> 33:10.156
and imagine the page
a little bigger,

33:10.256 --> 33:11.723
what does it
look like?

33:13.159 --> 33:15.061
Uh... it looks like a blue book

33:15.161 --> 33:16.828
that one of my teaching
assistants has graded.

33:16.928 --> 33:17.863
That's exactly
what I thought.

33:17.963 --> 33:19.231
Oh, yeah, one of those things

33:19.331 --> 33:21.033
you guys give your students
to do exams in, right?

33:21.133 --> 33:22.301
I think someone was
helping Danny Roberts.

33:22.401 --> 33:23.769
I think someone
was checking

33:23.869 --> 33:25.204
and improving his work.

33:25.304 --> 33:26.638
So he had an accomplice.

33:26.738 --> 33:29.308
Who was talented at math.

33:31.277 --> 33:32.911
WARNER:
So, according to Charlie,

33:33.011 --> 33:34.813
Roberts was getting
help on his system.

33:34.913 --> 33:36.148
COLBY:
Yeah, now, if Danny Roberts

33:36.248 --> 33:38.050
had an accomplice,
that means somebody else knows

33:38.150 --> 33:39.585
about the cheating
at the track.

33:39.685 --> 33:41.953
Which means we still have
a witness out there.

33:42.054 --> 33:43.055
Now, his girlfriend
told Megan

33:43.155 --> 33:44.723
that he worked
at the track alone.

33:44.823 --> 33:47.693
So maybe whoever helped
him wasn't at the track.

33:47.793 --> 33:51.463
The girlfriend was into
computers, she writes software.

33:51.563 --> 33:52.998
BOYD: Maurice,
just calm down, all right?

33:53.099 --> 33:54.700
CONNORS:
Well, how long is it gonna take?

33:54.800 --> 33:55.934
About 45 minutes.

33:56.034 --> 33:57.869
We got the full records
from Unemployment.

33:57.969 --> 34:00.339
Maurice Connors' name is
all over their interview cards.

34:00.439 --> 34:02.541
So, wait, what happened
to the five business days?

34:02.641 --> 34:04.042
I let her hold my gun.

34:04.143 --> 34:06.445
That's a subpoena.

34:06.545 --> 34:08.480
Every single one of
the Pick Six victims,

34:08.580 --> 34:10.216
they went into the track
looking for work,

34:10.316 --> 34:12.218
Connors must have directed them
straight to Tabakian.

34:12.318 --> 34:13.685
Wow, that's accessory to murder.

34:13.785 --> 34:15.854
Yeah, to say the least.

34:15.954 --> 34:17.022
All right, good.

34:17.123 --> 34:18.457
Hey, did you get anything

34:18.557 --> 34:20.492
on the guys who won
the bets on fixed races?

34:20.592 --> 34:23.129
Yeah, three of them had sheets,
mostly drug related.

34:23.229 --> 34:24.496
Ooh. Mind if I have a look?

34:24.596 --> 34:25.864
Yeah, I'll show you the
files. They're on my desk.

34:25.964 --> 34:27.399
I got to run,
but you can look at them.

34:28.467 --> 34:29.935
I want it noted
for the record

34:30.035 --> 34:31.370
that my client is
here voluntarily.

34:31.470 --> 34:33.372
Yeah, well, if it means
I didn't have to go out

34:33.472 --> 34:34.973
and drag him in here,
consider it noted.

34:35.073 --> 34:37.443
You have no cause
to arrest my client.

34:37.543 --> 34:39.278
DON:
You know these people, right?

34:39.945 --> 34:41.213
Go ahead, take a good look now.

34:41.313 --> 34:42.348
Don't answer that.

34:44.916 --> 34:45.951
You interviewed them for jobs.

34:46.051 --> 34:48.387
I interview a lot of people.

34:48.487 --> 34:50.322
How many get murdered
after winning the Pick Six?

34:50.422 --> 34:51.123
Maurice,

34:51.223 --> 34:52.758
I'm ordering you not to respond.

34:52.858 --> 34:53.759
You're ordering him?

34:53.859 --> 34:55.261
Who's the client here?

34:55.961 --> 34:57.596
Look, I got your name signed

34:57.696 --> 34:58.697
on the interview cards.

34:58.797 --> 35:01.700
All right? That's one,
two, three, four, five.

35:01.800 --> 35:03.835
I had nothing to do with this.

35:03.935 --> 35:05.371
Mr. Connors,
it's gonna take a jury

35:05.471 --> 35:07.439
about ten minutes
to decide otherwise.

35:08.807 --> 35:10.709
Maurice, you need to keep quiet.

35:10.809 --> 35:12.444
No, you need to keep quiet.

35:13.512 --> 35:15.781
Let's go.
We're done here.

35:15.881 --> 35:18.150
Walk out that door, I'm telling
you they're gonna kill you.

35:18.250 --> 35:20.752
-They will kill you.
-You have no right to interfere

35:20.852 --> 35:22.120
-with the representation
of my client. -Your client.

35:22.221 --> 35:24.022
Who's paying your bills,
counselor?

35:24.122 --> 35:25.791
Go ahead, ask him
who's paying his bills?

35:26.725 --> 35:29.127
Boyd?

35:31.397 --> 35:33.999
Maurice, don't make a mistake.

35:34.099 --> 35:36.735
I didn't kill anybody.

35:36.835 --> 35:40.339
I'm afraid
I can no longer represent you.

35:44.142 --> 35:47.179
One guess who
his first call's gonna be.

35:48.680 --> 35:50.316
Tabakian told me
to keep an eye out

35:50.416 --> 35:51.517
for single people,

35:51.617 --> 35:52.718
no families.

35:52.818 --> 35:55.454
People who could work the
late shift at his club.

35:55.554 --> 35:57.456
-Why?
-He told me he was

35:57.556 --> 36:00.091
expanding his business
into drug trafficking.

36:00.192 --> 36:01.693
He figured out a way
to clean their money.

36:01.793 --> 36:03.229
(knocking)

36:03.795 --> 36:05.931
All right. Mr. Connors.

36:06.031 --> 36:08.066
Just hang tight
for two minutes.

36:08.166 --> 36:10.302
(sighs)

36:12.037 --> 36:13.138
You remember how I told you

36:13.239 --> 36:14.673
I followed a drug supplier
to the track?

36:14.773 --> 36:15.607
Yeah, the Salvadorians.

36:15.707 --> 36:17.376
Yeah. Turns out
the supplier's name

36:17.476 --> 36:18.810
was on Colby's
list of people

36:18.910 --> 36:19.945
who won money

36:20.045 --> 36:21.112
on the fixed races.

36:21.213 --> 36:23.349
Looks like Tabakian
was paying for drugs

36:23.449 --> 36:25.717
by fixing races and laundering
money at the same time.

36:25.817 --> 36:28.320
Okay, what, they bet with the
dirty money, then he washes it.

36:28.420 --> 36:30.055
They even paid their taxes.

36:30.989 --> 36:32.391
Danny Roberts must have
just stumbled into this.

36:32.491 --> 36:33.659
Yeah, along with the girlfriend.

36:33.759 --> 36:35.294
Megan and Colby are
on their way to San Pedro

36:35.394 --> 36:36.562
and bringing her in right now.

36:36.662 --> 36:38.697
All right, good.

36:43.935 --> 36:45.837
Sharrlyn?

36:45.937 --> 36:48.407
It's Agent Reeves.

37:01.052 --> 37:03.755
It's clear.

37:07.693 --> 37:09.695
Granger.

37:16.067 --> 37:18.437
Look at this.

37:19.505 --> 37:21.273
That's blood spatter.

37:21.373 --> 37:23.942
Looks like Tabakian
got here before us.

37:34.620 --> 37:36.322
So the locals are running
a neighborhood canvas,

37:36.422 --> 37:38.023
but so far, nothing.

37:38.123 --> 37:40.626
What? They carried a girl's body
out of here in broad daylight.

37:40.726 --> 37:43.228
Yeah, we're trying to track down
deliveries or mailmen,

37:43.329 --> 37:44.763
anybody who might
have seen something.

37:44.863 --> 37:45.997
Sharrlyn Smith

37:46.097 --> 37:47.766
has a master's
degree in Math

37:47.866 --> 37:49.901
from Stanford University.

37:50.001 --> 37:51.503
So she was definitely
Danny Roberts' accomplice.

37:51.603 --> 37:54.005
Great. Which means
I just lost another witness.

37:54.105 --> 37:55.040
(cell phone ringing)

37:55.140 --> 37:56.942
Yeah?

37:57.609 --> 37:59.378
All right.
We got to go.

37:59.478 --> 38:01.513
The techs monitoring Danny
Roberts' account at the OTB,

38:01.613 --> 38:03.081
-they just got a hit.
-A hit?

38:03.181 --> 38:04.182
That half-million
dollar ticket,

38:04.282 --> 38:05.951
it just got cashed.

38:06.051 --> 38:08.186
MEGAN: Someone transferred
all the money

38:08.286 --> 38:09.855
to an off-shore account.

38:09.955 --> 38:13.525
Our techs traced it to
an IP address inside this hotel.

38:13.625 --> 38:15.260
Tabakian's crew
probably found the log-in IDs

38:15.361 --> 38:16.562
when they tossed
the girlfriend's apartment.

38:16.662 --> 38:19.264
So they killed our only witness,

38:19.365 --> 38:20.332
and they cashed
the ticket.

38:20.432 --> 38:22.000
Why leave a half mil
on the table

38:22.100 --> 38:23.301
if you don't have to?

38:23.402 --> 38:25.437
(whispering):
Let me get those keys.

38:33.545 --> 38:35.313
-FBI!
-FBI!

38:38.283 --> 38:39.885
You're supposed to be dead.

38:39.985 --> 38:42.320
(panting)

38:47.258 --> 38:49.895
Danny asked if I'd look
at his system.

38:49.995 --> 38:51.497
It just...

38:51.597 --> 38:53.632
it wasn't working anymore.

38:53.732 --> 38:56.868
And that's how you realized
they were fixing the races?

38:56.968 --> 38:59.671
The only way to explain
the results was cheating.

38:59.771 --> 39:02.107
So I wrote an algorithm
that included a proviso for it.

39:02.207 --> 39:04.242
That's how Danny

39:04.342 --> 39:05.444
picked 30 winners in a row.

39:05.544 --> 39:07.078
I didn't know
that he was doing that.

39:07.178 --> 39:08.580
You had the Pick Six ticket.

39:08.680 --> 39:10.716
We were afraid the tellers
would notice

39:10.816 --> 39:12.283
if he was winning all the time.

39:12.384 --> 39:13.719
But the Pick Six ticket...

39:13.819 --> 39:16.455
it would be enough for us
to start a life together.

39:19.024 --> 39:22.127
If I'd never worked on his
system, Danny wouldn't be dead.

39:24.162 --> 39:25.397
Why did you fake your death?

39:25.497 --> 39:27.466
They came to my house.

39:27.566 --> 39:28.667
I hid in my car.

39:28.767 --> 39:30.301
I waited all day
for them to leave.

39:30.402 --> 39:31.737
And when I saw
what they did,

39:31.837 --> 39:33.004
I panicked.

39:34.440 --> 39:36.341
I figured if everybody
thought I was dead...

39:36.442 --> 39:38.677
Sharrlyn...
your algorithm gives us

39:38.777 --> 39:41.212
a wedge into
a major narcotics ring.

39:41.312 --> 39:44.950
But Tabakian and his guys are
not gonna stop looking for you

39:45.050 --> 39:47.285
until they... know

39:47.385 --> 39:49.287
you're not
a threat to them.

39:49.387 --> 39:50.622
So what am I supposed to do?

39:50.722 --> 39:51.790
You help us, and we protect you.

39:51.890 --> 39:54.159
Agent Reeves, they killed Danny

39:54.259 --> 39:56.394
in broad daylight, in front
of a crowd of people.

39:56.495 --> 39:59.030
I know. And I'm not gonna
let that happen to you.

40:00.599 --> 40:02.167
But you have to help me.

40:09.340 --> 40:10.776
(tires screeching)

40:10.876 --> 40:14.379
Back at Quantico, it was
all about the rush for me.

40:14.480 --> 40:16.381
-But now... -What?
You're mellowing with age?

40:16.482 --> 40:17.415
Don't get me wrong,

40:17.516 --> 40:18.550
I still like
kicking down doors.

40:18.650 --> 40:20.051
Yeah, I know,
it can wear thin, right?

40:25.390 --> 40:27.593
(talking indistinctly)

40:35.033 --> 40:36.768
Ivan Tabakian, FBI.

40:36.868 --> 40:38.303
I've got a warrant
for your arrest.

40:38.403 --> 40:40.071
Let's go, get up.

40:41.973 --> 40:43.108
Let's go! Get up.

40:44.175 --> 40:46.077
I'm eating my fish.

40:46.177 --> 40:47.178
(laughter)

40:47.278 --> 40:48.914
A nice sea bass.

40:49.014 --> 40:51.116
Perhaps this can wait?

40:53.151 --> 40:54.285
Hey!

40:54.385 --> 40:55.887
DON:
Was I talking to you?! Huh?!

40:55.987 --> 40:57.723
Wasn't talking
to you, either.

40:58.389 --> 41:00.025
Get up!

41:02.060 --> 41:03.194
All right.

41:03.294 --> 41:04.896
I know the drill.

41:04.996 --> 41:06.431
Uh-huh.

41:06.532 --> 41:08.567
This time, we got a witness
you can't touch.

41:08.667 --> 41:10.101
-(handcuffs snap)
-Let's go.

41:18.610 --> 41:20.679
(jazz music playing)

41:21.880 --> 41:23.582
MEGAN: Maybe it's just
my own history speaking,

41:23.682 --> 41:26.885
but I'd like to think that
Antoine grows up to be a cop.

41:26.985 --> 41:27.853
What? A cop?

41:27.953 --> 41:29.988
Did you and I just see
the same movie?

41:30.088 --> 41:32.758
Well, you never know
how things turn out.

41:32.858 --> 41:36.862
Well, I guess for some people,
that's part of the fun.

41:36.962 --> 41:38.063
And for you?

41:38.163 --> 41:40.098
(laughing):
Clearly, I'm not some people.

41:40.198 --> 41:41.432
(laughs)

41:41.533 --> 41:43.501
So go over the schedule
with me one more time.

41:43.602 --> 41:47.272
Okay, dinner and a movie
every other Friday,

41:47.372 --> 41:49.474
lunch on Thursdays.

41:49.575 --> 41:50.809
No, Wednesdays.

41:50.909 --> 41:52.744
And I get a wild
card once a month.

41:52.844 --> 41:55.246
That's it, that's it.
To use at your own discretion.

41:55.346 --> 41:57.549
And what do we call this?

41:57.649 --> 42:01.987
Oh... how about
structured complexity?

42:02.087 --> 42:03.789
(laughs)

42:03.889 --> 42:06.892
You know, I'm thinking
of using my wildcard.

42:06.992 --> 42:07.826
Oh, yeah?

42:07.926 --> 42:09.828
Yeah. Maybe for
breakfast tomorrow.

42:09.928 --> 42:12.497
* There's no easy way...

42:12.598 --> 42:13.498
Okay.

42:13.599 --> 42:19.671
* To say good-bye.
