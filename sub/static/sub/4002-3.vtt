DID THE DOCTOR SAY?

13:05.875 --> 13:07.208
HE ASKED ME
A MILLION QUESTIONS

18:15.208 --> 18:16.250

RIGHT IN THE BACK

18:20.000 --> 18:21.375
OF MY HEAD, RIGHT THERE.

18:21.375 --> 18:23.041
OUCH.

18:23.041 --> 18:26.250
HE WAS A COLLEGE PROFESSOR
BACK IN CUBA.

18:26.250 --> 18:28.750
ONCE HE GOT MARRIED
AND HAD A COUPLE KIDS,

18:28.750 --> 18:30.333

18:30.333 --> 18:32.333
TIME TO GET AWAY
FROM CASTRO'S WORLD.

18:32.333 --> 18:34.667
SO WE CAME OVER ON ONE

18:48.458 --> 18:52.458
YEAH, HE WAS A REAL HERO,
MY FATHER WAS.

18:52.458 --> 18:55.166
HE SPENT THE REST
OF HIS LIFE TELLING EVERYBODY

18:55.166 --> 18:56.750
WHAT A GREAT MAN
HE COULD HAVE BEEN

18:56.750 --> 18:59.041

I WAS A FAILURE.

19:22.250 --> 19:25.166
I COULD
NEVER MEASURE UP.

19:30.125 --> 19:32.291

WAS DISGUSTED BY ME.

19:34.500 --> 19:37.667

19:37.667 --> 19:38.917
THEN NO OFFENSE
TO THE DEAD,

19:38.917 --> 19:40.583
BUT YOUR FATHER
WAS AN IDIOT.

19:40.583 --> 19:41.792

NEVER SAID THAT

HE WAS BORN,

20:19.792 --> 20:22.166
MY FATHER
WAS HARDLY EVEN AROUND.

21:00.500 --> 21:03.333
TELL HIM THAT I RECEIVED
AN ANONYMOUS TIP

21:03.333 --> 21:05.917
ABOUT WHERE FREEBO
CAN BE FOUND,

21:05.917 --> 21:07.458
THAT WOULD CLOSE
THE CASE.

21:07.458 --> 21:09.375
AND WE CAN ALL PUT IT
BEHIND US.

21:11.375 --> 21:13.083
SORRY,
IT'S NOT POSSIBLE.

21:13.083 --> 21:14.542
OF COURSE IT IS.
I'LL HELP.

21:14.542 --> 21:17.875
MIGUEL, THE BODY'S...
GONE.

21:17.875 --> 21:20.208
I'LL GET IT.
JUST TELL ME WHERE IT IS.

21:20.208 --> 21:21.542
(Dexter)
HE'S NOT GOING TO GIVE UP.

21:21.542 --> 21:23.709
HE NEEDS TO SEE SOMETHING.

21:23.709 --> 21:24.959
I'LL TAKE YOU
THERE.

21:24.959 --> 21:27.709
TOMORROW.
HUH?

21:27.709 --> 21:28.583
LUNCHTIME.

21:28.583 --> 21:30.375
OKAY.

21:30.375 --> 21:32.208
I'LL PICK YOU UP.

21:32.208 --> 21:33.750
BUT LOOK, DEXTER.

21:33.750 --> 21:35.208
YOU'RE NOT
IN THIS ALONE, HUH?

21:35.208 --> 21:38.250
IT'S YOU AND ME.

21:38.250 --> 21:39.750
TOGETHER.

21:46.166 --> 21:47.250
(Dexter)
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

21:47.250 --> 21:49.417
THIS WHOLE "TOGETHER" THING.

21:53.250 --> 21:54.250
HEY, STRANGER.

21:54.250 --> 21:55.917
SHIT.

21:57.083 --> 21:58.417
ALL RIGHT, LOOK.

21:58.417 --> 21:59.667
IT'S ONE THING FOR YOU
TO COME TO THE CLUB.

21:59.667 --> 22:02.208
BUT DON'T BE TRACKING ME DOWN
ALL OVER THE PLACE.

22:02.208 --> 22:03.750
I CALLED YOU THREE TIMES,
IF YOU'D BOTHERED

22:03.750 --> 22:05.250
TO RETURN ANY
OF THOSE PHONE CALLS,

22:05.250 --> 22:07.000
YOU COULD HAVE PICKED
THE LOCATION.

22:07.000 --> 22:09.583
NO, I'M SORRY DOESN'T WORK
THAT WAY.

22:14.083 --> 22:15.667
SHIT.

22:15.667 --> 22:17.667
THIS IS BULLSHIT.

22:17.667 --> 22:18.750
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

22:18.750 --> 22:20.250
[sighs]

22:20.250 --> 22:21.583
TELL ME ABOUT JAVIER.

22:21.583 --> 22:22.792
OKAY,
IN CASE YOU HAVEN'T HEARD,

22:22.792 --> 22:24.208
HE'S DEAD.

22:24.208 --> 22:26.083
I HAVE HEARD.
WHAT ELSE DO YOU KNOW?

22:26.083 --> 22:27.750
THAT YOU WERE ONE
OF THE LAST ONES

22:27.750 --> 22:28.667
TO TALK TO HIM.

22:28.667 --> 22:30.083
LOOKS LIKE
HAVING A CONVERSATION

22:30.083 --> 22:32.250
WITH YOU CAN BE DANGEROUS
TO ONE'S HEALTH.

22:32.250 --> 22:34.250
WHO HAD PROBLEMS
WITH JAVIER?

22:34.250 --> 22:35.583
I DON'T KNOW.

22:35.583 --> 22:37.458
BUT I'M THINKING I SHOULDN'T
GIVE YOU ANY MORE NAMES,

22:37.458 --> 22:39.500
OR THEY MIGHT END
UP DEAD TOO.

22:39.500 --> 22:41.625
WELL, YOU BETTER GIVE ME
SOMETHING, ANTON.

22:41.625 --> 22:44.041
I DON'T LIKE YOU
TALKING TO ME THAT WAY.

22:44.041 --> 22:45.417
[laughs]
OH, I'M SORRY.

22:45.417 --> 22:48.083
I DIDN'T REALIZE YOU
WERE SUCH A HIGH-CLASS SNITCH.

22:48.083 --> 22:51.667
WELL, NO PART
OF ME NEEDS THIS.

22:51.667 --> 22:53.458
SO WHY DON'T YOU JUST
LET ME OUT OF HERE.

22:53.458 --> 22:55.041
NOT TILL I GET SOME ANSWERS.
WHAT, AM I YOUR PRISONER?

22:55.041 --> 22:56.625
LOOK, WE HAVE A DEAL.

22:56.625 --> 22:58.834
AND I'M NOT LEAVING UNTIL I
GET SOME INFORMATION.

22:58.834 --> 23:00.709
YOU KNOW SOMETHING?
I KNOW WHAT'LL MAKE YOU LEAVE.

23:00.709 --> 23:02.166
[sniffing]

23:02.166 --> 23:03.750
WHAT THE FUCK?
GET RID OF THAT.

23:03.750 --> 23:05.000
YOU SURE DON'T WANT ANYONE
TO KNOW

23:05.000 --> 23:06.083
YOU CAME
TO THE MEN'S ROOM

23:06.083 --> 23:08.000
WITH YOUR CI AND LIT UP
A LITTLE JOINT, DO YOU?

23:08.000 --> 23:10.625
FUCKIN' FLUSH IT.

23:10.625 --> 23:13.834
I CAN'T FLUSH THIS, MAMA.
THIS IS PREMIUM ISLAND LADY.

23:15.166 --> 23:17.083
IF YOU LIGHT THAT,
I'LL ARREST YOU.

23:17.083 --> 23:19.625
DON'T WORRY,
THERE'S MORE THAN ENOUGH.

23:19.625 --> 23:21.834
I'LL SHARE.

23:32.542 --> 23:34.834
I TOLD YOU
NOT TO FUCKING DO IT!

23:44.500 --> 23:47.166
(Dexter)
IT SEEMS IRONIC THAT I,

23:47.166 --> 23:48.709
AN EXPERT
ON HUMAN DISMEMBERMENT,

23:48.709 --> 23:50.542
HAVE TO PAY $800

23:50.542 --> 23:52.458
TO HAVE MYSELF
VIRTUALLY DISSECTED.

24:01.792 --> 24:04.083
CHECK OUT THIS BRAIN.

24:04.083 --> 24:05.208
THIS ONE BELONGED
TO A SERIAL KILLER

24:05.208 --> 24:06.917
EXECUTED LAST MONTH.

24:06.917 --> 24:09.041
KILLED 11 WOMEN.

24:09.041 --> 24:11.709
THEN HE REALLY  SNAPPED.

24:11.709 --> 24:15.083
KILLED HIS WIFE, TWO KIDS,
AND THE NEIGHBOR'S DOG.

24:15.083 --> 24:17.083
WHY ARE YOU
SHOWING ME THIS?

24:17.083 --> 24:19.834
LOOK.

24:19.834 --> 24:21.542
HOW MUCH SMALLER
THE RIGHT HEMISPHERE IS.

24:21.542 --> 24:24.041
THIS GUY SURE DOESN'T PROCESS
A LOT OF EMOTIONS, HUH?

24:24.041 --> 24:25.208
AND YOU SEE ALL THIS ACTIVITY

24:25.208 --> 24:26.583
IN THE SUB-CORTEX REGION?

24:26.583 --> 24:28.041
THAT'S WHERE FEELINGS
OF AGGRESSION

24:28.041 --> 24:29.500
AND VIOLENCE COME FROM.

24:29.500 --> 24:31.750
WHY ARE YOU--
BECAUSE.

24:31.750 --> 24:33.500
LOOK.

24:34.959 --> 24:36.625
IT'S EXACTLY THE SAME
AS YOUR BRAIN, DEX.

24:50.166 --> 24:52.917
FREEBO'S FINAL RESTING
PLACE.

24:52.917 --> 24:54.917
HOW?

24:58.458 --> 25:00.041
THEY DIG THE GRAVES
THE DAY BEFORE,

25:00.041 --> 25:02.041
THEY PLACE A TARP
OVER EACH ONE.

25:02.041 --> 25:04.417
IT WASN'T THAT HARD

25:04.417 --> 25:06.500
TO BRING FREEBO HERE
LATE AT NIGHT,

25:06.500 --> 25:08.208
FIND AN OPEN GRAVE
TO PLACE HIS BODY IN,

25:08.208 --> 25:09.542
AND THEN TO...

25:09.542 --> 25:11.083
COVER IT UP
WITH A FOOT OF DIRT.

25:11.083 --> 25:12.625
AND THEN THE NEXT DAY,

25:12.625 --> 25:15.291
THEY LOWER A 500 POUND CASKET
ON TOP OF HIM,

25:15.291 --> 25:16.917
COVER IT ALL UP
WITH DIRT.

25:16.917 --> 25:18.291
HIDING A BODY
IN A CEMETERY.

25:18.291 --> 25:19.625
YOU'RE FUCKING BRILLIANT.

25:22.458 --> 25:23.959
I'LL JUST GET A JUDGE
TO ISSUE

25:23.959 --> 25:25.917
AN EXHUMATION ORDER NOW,
AND THEN WE--

25:25.917 --> 25:27.458
I NEED YOU
TO NOT DO THAT.

25:27.458 --> 25:29.458
LOOK, I'VE NEVER
DONE THIS BEFORE.

25:29.458 --> 25:30.625
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT KIND OF EVIDENCE

25:30.625 --> 25:31.792
I LEFT ON THE BODY.

25:31.792 --> 25:33.625
HAIR,
AND FIBERS...

25:33.625 --> 25:34.959
I CAN'T HAVE IT TRACED
BACK TO ME.

25:34.959 --> 25:36.333
FAIR ENOUGH.

25:36.333 --> 25:37.625
FAIR ENOUGH.

25:40.458 --> 25:43.750
IT DOES LEAVE US
WITH OUR NEXT LITTLE PROBLEM.

25:43.750 --> 25:45.709
WHAT IS THAT?

25:45.709 --> 25:46.792
WELL, WE STILL HAVE SOMEONE
OUT THERE

25:46.792 --> 25:49.250
SKINNING
AND KILLING PEOPLE.

25:49.250 --> 25:50.750
YES, WE DO.

25:50.750 --> 25:52.667
AND YOUR HOMICIDE SQUAD,
THEY THINK IT'S FREEBO,

25:52.667 --> 25:54.250
AND THEY'RE WASTING
TIME AND ENERGY

25:54.250 --> 25:55.625
LOOKING
FOR A DEAD MAN,

25:55.625 --> 25:57.542
WHEN...

25:57.542 --> 25:58.625
THE REAL KILLER,
WHOEVER THAT MIGHT BE,

25:58.625 --> 26:00.166
IS OUT THERE
WALKING FREE.

26:00.166 --> 26:01.792
WELL HOW'S THAT
OUR PROBLEM?

26:01.792 --> 26:04.542
BECAUSE JUSTICE
ISN'T BEING SERVED.

26:04.542 --> 26:06.333
OF COURSE.

26:06.333 --> 26:08.583
OF COURSE.
WE HAVE TO...

26:08.583 --> 26:11.000
STEER THE POLICE
IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.

26:11.000 --> 26:12.333
HOW DO WE DO THIS?

26:12.333 --> 26:13.750
[scoffs]

26:13.750 --> 26:16.709
I DON'T HAVE
A FUCKING CLUE.

26:16.709 --> 26:17.792
(Dexter)
BUT I'VE GOT A FEELING
YOU'RE NOT GOING

26:17.792 --> 26:20.000
TO LEAVE ME ALONE
UNTIL WE FIGURE THIS OUT.

26:20.000 --> 26:21.667
TOGETHER.

26:21.667 --> 26:24.667
WHAT DO YOU THINK
ABOUT COWBOYS?

26:24.667 --> 26:28.083
UH...

26:28.083 --> 26:31.041
RUGGED AMERICAN HEROES?

26:31.041 --> 26:32.375
[laughs]

26:32.375 --> 26:34.083
NO, I MEANT
FOR THE BABY'S ROOM.

26:34.083 --> 26:35.959
OH.

26:35.959 --> 26:37.375
NICE.

26:37.375 --> 26:40.166
WE CAN DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT
IF YOU WANT.

26:40.166 --> 26:42.000
[sighs]

26:42.000 --> 26:43.667
YEAH,
COWBOYS ARE...

26:43.667 --> 26:45.959
FINE.

26:54.208 --> 26:56.041
HEY,
ARE YOU READY TO GO

26:56.041 --> 26:57.166
TO THAT YOGA CLASS?

26:57.166 --> 26:59.875
SURE.

26:59.875 --> 27:01.083
ASTOR!
CODY!

27:01.083 --> 27:02.959
COME ON.
LET'S GO.

27:05.208 --> 27:08.917
[camera clicking]

27:18.417 --> 27:20.834
(Dexter)
NATHAN MARTEN.

27:20.834 --> 27:23.583
AS THE SUN BEGINS TO SET,

27:23.583 --> 27:26.750
THE LOWLY SCAVENGERS
REVEAL THEMSELVES.

27:26.750 --> 27:28.917
HEY,
IT'S THE CHEERIOS MAN.

27:28.917 --> 27:31.125
WHO?

27:31.125 --> 27:33.166
THE GUY
FROM THE GROCERY STORE.

27:35.458 --> 27:36.750
WHAT GUY?

27:36.750 --> 27:38.083
THE MAN
WHO TALKED TO ME.

27:38.083 --> 27:39.417
DEXTER KNOWS.

27:39.417 --> 27:42.834
WHO IS HE?

27:45.250 --> 27:46.750
HE'S NO ONE
TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT.

27:49.208 --> 27:50.709
(Dexter)
BECAUSE IN A LAND
OF PREDATORS,

27:50.709 --> 27:54.291
A LION NEVER FEARS
THE JACKAL.

27:58.792 --> 28:02.291
AND HERE WE GO;
INTO ANOTHER WARRIOR POSE.

28:02.291 --> 28:05.625
FEEL YOUR HIPS
OPEN UP.

28:05.625 --> 28:07.959
WE ARE STRONG WARRIORS.

28:07.959 --> 28:09.041
ALL OF US.

28:09.041 --> 28:10.417
(Dexter)
THIS IS ABSOLUTELY,
WITHOUT A DOUBT,

28:10.417 --> 28:13.166
THE WORST MOMENT
OF MY LIFE.

28:13.166 --> 28:15.208
NOW LET'S GO
INTO A LITTLE FREE-FORM YOGA.

28:15.208 --> 28:18.583
JUST LET YOURSELF DANCE.

28:18.583 --> 28:22.417
(Dexter)
I WAS WRONG.
THIS IS.

28:22.417 --> 28:25.250
...DUST DANCING
AGAINST THE SUNLIGHT.

28:25.250 --> 28:27.917
BE AS BEAUTIFUL

28:27.917 --> 28:33.500
AS THE GOLDEN FLAKES
OF DUST, DEXTER.

28:33.500 --> 28:34.709
(Dexter)
I COULD PROBABLY KILL HER

28:34.709 --> 28:36.959
BEFORE ANYONE REALIZED
WHAT HAPPENED.

28:36.959 --> 28:38.125
[slow breathing]

28:38.125 --> 28:39.750
EXCELLENT.

28:39.750 --> 28:41.667
NOW I WANT ALL THE PARTNERS

28:41.667 --> 28:44.667
TO TURN AND FACE
THEIR PREGNANT WOMEN.

28:44.667 --> 28:47.208
TAKE YOUR HAND
AND PLACE IT ON HER BELLY.

28:49.375 --> 28:50.917
AND I WANT YOU TO SEND ALL

28:50.917 --> 28:54.375
OF YOUR POSITIVE INTENTIONS
TO YOUR UNBORN BABY.

28:56.500 --> 28:57.667
(Dexter)
I'M SORRY.

28:57.667 --> 28:59.750
I JUST DON'T WANT
TO HURT YOU.

29:18.041 --> 29:19.917
(woman)
GOOD MORNING, MR. PRADO.

29:19.917 --> 29:21.875
ARE YOU SATISFIED WITH
THE SENTENCING OF CHICKY HINES?

29:21.875 --> 29:22.834
I AM.

29:22.834 --> 29:24.125
I PUSHED FOR THE MAXIMUM
ON THIS CASE,

29:24.125 --> 29:25.834
AND I GOT IT,
AND FOR JUST CAUSE.

29:25.834 --> 29:28.959
WITH MR. HINES BEHIND BARS
FOR A VERY LONG TIME,

29:28.959 --> 29:31.250
I'M HOPING THAT THE FAMILIES
OF HIS VICTIMS

29:31.250 --> 29:32.625
CAN FINALLY FIND SOME PEACE.

29:32.625 --> 29:33.625
THANK YOU.

29:33.625 --> 29:36.542
MIGUEL.
MARIA.

29:36.542 --> 29:38.709
ANOTHER WIN FOR OUR TEAM,
HUH?

29:38.709 --> 29:40.750
I HAVE TO ADMIT,
I'M A LITTLE CONFUSED.

29:40.750 --> 29:44.250
WHAT HAPPENED
WITH THE WITNESS I GAVE YOU?

29:44.250 --> 29:45.250
I THOUGHT HE
HAD INFORMATION

29:45.250 --> 29:46.667
THAT EXONERATED
CHICKY HINES?

29:46.667 --> 29:49.709
I REVIEWED HIS STATEMENT,
IT JUST DIDN'T ADD UP.

29:49.709 --> 29:52.333
I THOUGHT IT HAD
AT LEAST MERITED

29:52.333 --> 29:54.291
A CONVERSATION
WITH HIM.

29:56.792 --> 29:58.667
I SEE THIS KIND OF STUFF
ALL THE TIME, MARIA.

29:58.667 --> 29:59.709
AND I KNOW YOU DO TOO.

29:59.709 --> 30:01.959
SCUMBAGS TRYING TO PLAY
THE SYSTEM,

30:01.959 --> 30:03.959
DOING WHATEVER THEY CAN
TO STAY OUT OF JAIL.

30:07.583 --> 30:09.667
TRUST ME ON THIS ONE, HM?

30:09.667 --> 30:11.959
MS. WOLF, DO YOU HAVE
A STATEMENT?

30:11.959 --> 30:14.458
YES, I IMAGINE THE ASSISTANT
DISTRICT ATTORNEY PRADO,

30:14.458 --> 30:15.750
IS GOING TO GO HOME NOW

30:15.750 --> 30:19.208
AND STRIP DOWN
TO HIS AMERICAN FLAG UNDERWEAR,

30:19.208 --> 30:21.750
AND POUR HIMSELF MAYBE A NICE
CRIME-FIGHTING DRINK.

30:21.750 --> 30:23.083
MAKE A FEW
FUND-RAISING PHONE CALLS

30:23.083 --> 30:25.834
FOR HIS UPCOMING RUN
FOR D.A.

30:25.834 --> 30:27.083
BUT THE TRUTH IS...

30:27.083 --> 30:29.291
HE JUST SENT AN INNOCENT MAN
TO PRISON.

30:29.291 --> 30:31.333
FOR 28 YEARS.

30:31.333 --> 30:34.625
UGH, HE SHOULD BE ASHAMED
OF HIMSELF.

30:34.625 --> 30:36.667
IT'S DESPICABLE.

30:44.458 --> 30:46.125
SOMEONE'S GOT TO KNOW
WHO SHE IS.

30:46.125 --> 30:47.417
NO LUCK?

30:47.417 --> 30:48.834
I'M THINKING OF PUTTING
HER PICTURE ON MILK CARTONS.

30:51.834 --> 30:53.125
NOT A BAD IDEA.

30:53.125 --> 30:55.625
YEAH, EXCEPT NOBODY
WOULD EVER DRINK MILK AGAIN.

31:01.792 --> 31:04.000
WHY THE FUCK
DID YOU LOCK UP MY CI?

31:04.000 --> 31:06.125
WHY DO YOU
KEEP CALLING HIM YOUR CI?

31:07.583 --> 31:08.875
IS THERE SOMETHING
YOU'RE NOT TELLING US?

31:11.792 --> 31:13.792
YOU'RE VERY CURIOUS ABOUT ME,
AREN'T YOU?

31:13.792 --> 31:16.250
LOOK AT YOU,
CHANGING THE SUBJECT.

31:16.250 --> 31:18.834
HEY, SARGE.

31:18.834 --> 31:21.208
UM, CAN YOU ASK OFFICER MORGAN

31:21.208 --> 31:22.417
WHY MY CI'S
IN LOCKUP?

31:25.792 --> 31:28.583
HE WAS ANTAGONISTIC.
HE PRODUCED A JOINT.

31:28.583 --> 31:30.667
I WARNED HIM NOT TO LIGHT IT
OR I'D HAVE TO BUST HIM.

31:30.667 --> 31:32.000
HE LIT IT.

31:33.500 --> 31:34.834
I KNEW I COULDN'T BACK DOWN,

31:34.834 --> 31:36.750
OR HE'D NEVER HAVE
TO COOPERATE WITH ME AGAIN.

31:36.750 --> 31:38.458
HE PRACTICALLY
ARRESTED HIMSELF.

31:38.458 --> 31:41.000
THAT MAKES SENSE
TO ME.

31:41.000 --> 31:42.333
YOU GOT A PROBLEM
WITH THAT?
NO.

31:42.333 --> 31:44.667
GOOD.

31:48.709 --> 31:49.917
CUT HIM LOOSE.

32:15.417 --> 32:17.375
DO I KNOW YOU?

32:17.375 --> 32:20.542
WE MET AT THE GROCERY STORE
THE OTHER DAY.

32:20.542 --> 32:23.542
I DON'T RECALL.

32:23.542 --> 32:25.375
YOU ASKED
MY GIRRIEND'S DAUGHTER

32:25.375 --> 32:26.875
TO HELP YOU FIND
THE CHEERIOS.

32:26.875 --> 32:29.875
OH.
RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT.

32:29.875 --> 32:31.291
SO WHAT CAN I DO
FOR YOU?

32:31.291 --> 32:32.458
SHUT THE FUCK UP,
NATHAN.

32:34.583 --> 32:36.000
STAY AWAY FROM MY KIDS.

32:36.000 --> 32:37.208
WHAT?

32:37.208 --> 32:38.875
[nervous chuckle]
SORRY, BUDDY,
YOU GOT THE WRONG IDEA.

32:38.875 --> 32:40.208
I SAW YOU
AT THE BEACH YESTERDAY

32:40.208 --> 32:41.625
WITH YOUR CAMERA.

32:41.625 --> 32:44.583
I'M A PHOTOGRAPHER.

32:44.583 --> 32:46.166
I ALWAYS HAVE A CAMERA
WITH ME.

32:46.166 --> 32:48.750
[whispers]
I KNOW WHO YOU ARE.

32:48.750 --> 32:51.208
I KNOW WHAT YOU ARE.

32:51.208 --> 32:53.959
ONCE.

32:53.959 --> 32:55.750
ONCE I MADE
A HORRIBLE MISTAKE.

32:55.750 --> 32:57.458
AND I PAID THE PRICE
FOR IT.

32:57.458 --> 33:00.709
I DID MY TIME.

33:00.709 --> 33:02.917
BUT I'M NOT LIKE THAT
ANYMORE.

33:02.917 --> 33:04.458
I LEARNED MY LESSON.

33:04.458 --> 33:06.542
I'VE CHANGED.

33:06.542 --> 33:09.250
YOU HAVEN'T CHANGED.
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

33:11.625 --> 33:14.291
WE ARE WHAT WE ARE.

33:20.917 --> 33:22.500
(Dexter)
NIGHT.

33:22.500 --> 33:25.166
GOOD FOR THE HUNTER.
BAD FOR THE HUNTED.

33:26.583 --> 33:27.875
NATHAN MARTEN.

33:27.875 --> 33:31.792
IS YOUR PAST THE PROLOGUE
TO YOUR FUTURE?

33:31.792 --> 33:34.000
FROM THE OUTSIDE,
HE LOOKS NORMAL.

33:34.000 --> 33:35.875
BUT LIKE ME,
HIS BRAIN IS FLAWED

33:35.875 --> 33:38.333
AND HE HAS A COMPULSION
HE'S UNABLE TO CONTROL.

33:38.333 --> 33:40.458
WE'RE REALLY
NOT SO DIFFERENT,

33:40.458 --> 33:42.542
NATHAN AND I.

33:42.542 --> 33:44.458
EXCEPT THAT I
WOULD NEVER HURT A CHILD.

33:44.458 --> 33:47.792
THEN AGAIN,
NATHAN HAS NEVER KILLED ANYONE.

33:47.792 --> 33:51.291
WHICH MEANS HE DOESN'T
FIT MY CODE.

33:51.291 --> 33:53.667
I HAVE OTHER PROBLEMS
TO DEAL WITH BESIDES NATHAN.

34:02.875 --> 34:05.667
[cell phone ringing]

34:05.667 --> 34:08.041
MIGUEL PRADO.

34:14.083 --> 34:16.959
AND TEEGAN CAMPBELL.

34:16.959 --> 34:19.041
IF I TAKE CARE OF ONE,
I TAKE CARE OF THE OTHER.

34:23.667 --> 34:25.959
IT'S A NEW DAY IN MIAMI.

34:25.959 --> 34:28.667
PERFECT TIME
TO HELP DEB HELP HERSELF.

34:28.667 --> 34:31.166
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT MAKES
MY SISTER A GOOD COP

34:31.166 --> 34:33.291
IS THAT SHE'S LIKE A DOG
WITH A BONE.

34:33.291 --> 34:34.959
ONCE SHE'S GOT HER TEETH
INTO SOMETHING,

34:34.959 --> 34:37.000
SHE'LL NEVER LET GO.

34:37.000 --> 34:39.375
ALL I HAVE TO DO IS LEAD HER
TO THE BONE.

34:45.208 --> 34:46.375
HEY, PAPA!

34:46.375 --> 34:48.417
OH, HI.

34:48.417 --> 34:50.208
OH, GOD.
ALMOST FORGOT.

34:53.208 --> 34:54.291
ISN'T IT GREAT?!

34:54.291 --> 34:56.583
NICE.

34:58.208 --> 35:00.125
HAVE YOU STARTED THINKING
ABOUT NAMES YET?

35:00.125 --> 35:02.041
NOT THAT I WANT TO PUSH IT
ON YOU OR ANYTHING,

35:02.041 --> 35:03.542
BUT, IF YOU HAVE A GIRL,

35:03.542 --> 35:05.500
DEBRA'S
A REALLY GOOD NAME.

35:05.500 --> 35:07.959
DEB,
I SHOULD TELL YOU...

35:07.959 --> 35:09.333
OH, MY GOD.
WHAT HAPPENED?

35:09.333 --> 35:10.500
NOTHING HAPPENED.

35:10.500 --> 35:11.875
IT'S JUST...

35:11.875 --> 35:16.875
I'M NOT SURE I'M GOING
TO BE THERE TO RAISE THE BABY.

35:16.875 --> 35:18.375
WHAT?

35:18.375 --> 35:20.208
I DON'T KNOW IF I'M GOING TO BE
A FATHER TO THE KID.

35:21.375 --> 35:22.792
OW!

35:22.792 --> 35:24.875
OF COURSE YOU ARE,
YOU MORON.

35:24.875 --> 35:26.834
DEB--
SHUT THE FUCK UP!

35:26.834 --> 35:28.000
HOW COULD YOU EVEN SAY
YOU'RE NOT GOING

35:28.000 --> 35:29.750
TO BE A FATHER
TO THAT KID?

35:29.750 --> 35:31.083
I MEAN, WHERE WOULD YOU BE
WITHOUT HARRY?

35:31.083 --> 35:34.583
AND HE WASN'T EVEN
YOUR BIOLOGICAL FATHER.

35:34.583 --> 35:37.709
I JUST THINK I'M GOING TO BE
A LOUSY FATHER.

35:37.709 --> 35:39.041
I DON'T WANT
TO SCREW THE KID UP.

35:39.041 --> 35:40.583
WOULD YOU PLEASE
STOP DOING THAT?

35:40.583 --> 35:42.583
THEN STOP SAYING
STUPID THINGS.

35:45.709 --> 35:47.041
I MEAN, FIRST OF ALL,
WHO ARE WE KIDDING?

35:47.041 --> 35:48.750
YOU'RE GOING TO BE
A GREAT FATHER.

35:51.333 --> 35:52.500
AND SECOND...

35:52.500 --> 35:55.750
AND MUCH MORE IMPORTANT,
BIG DUMB BROTHER OF MINE,

35:55.750 --> 35:57.083
THIS ISN'T ABOUT YOU.

36:01.333 --> 36:02.542
WHO'S IT ABOUT?

36:02.542 --> 36:04.959
[sighs]

36:04.959 --> 36:06.333
THE BABY.

36:06.333 --> 36:09.959
SO IT DOESN'T MATTER
HOW SCARED YOU ARE,

36:09.959 --> 36:12.458
HOW RELUCTANT
OR UNPREPARED YOU MIGHT FEEL,

36:12.458 --> 36:13.792
THE BABY COMES FIRST.

36:13.792 --> 36:15.625
AND THAT BABY NEEDS YOU.

36:17.792 --> 36:20.375
SO YOU'RE JUST GOING
TO HAVE TO SET ASIDE ALL OF--

36:22.792 --> 36:24.959
HOLY SHIT.
THAT'S MY JANE DOE.

36:24.959 --> 36:27.208
(Dexter)
IT'S ABOUT TIME.

36:27.208 --> 36:28.417
ARE YOU SURE?

36:28.417 --> 36:30.959
YEAH, THAT'S HER.
TEEGAN CAMPBELL.

36:30.959 --> 36:32.041
IT LOOKS LIKE HER.

36:32.041 --> 36:33.834
YEAH, I GOTTA GO, DEX.
THIS IS BIG.

36:36.709 --> 36:38.792
WHAT'S THAT FOR?

36:38.792 --> 36:40.875
I KNOW YOU, DEX.

36:40.875 --> 36:43.166
YOU'RE THE BEST BROTHER
IN THE WORLD.

36:43.166 --> 36:45.458
AND YOU CAN DO THIS.

36:45.458 --> 36:47.291
AND IF YOU
DON'T TRUST YOURSELF,

36:47.291 --> 36:49.291
TRUST ME.

36:49.291 --> 36:51.041
I'M THE SMART ONE
IN THE FAMILY.

37:08.417 --> 37:10.166
(Dexter)
THEY LOOK MOTIVATED.

37:11.792 --> 37:13.041
ANYTHING?

37:13.041 --> 37:14.333
CLARO.

37:14.333 --> 37:15.500
ONCE MORGAN HERE
FOUND OUT

37:15.500 --> 37:17.041
THAT JANE DOE
WAS TEEGAN CAMPBELL,

37:17.041 --> 37:18.709
IT WAS A QUICK STEP
TO FIND HER APARTMENT.

37:18.709 --> 37:19.959
AND GUESS WHO'D
BEEN HIDING OUT THERE?

37:19.959 --> 37:21.834
FREEBO.
HIS SHIT WAS EVERYWHERE.

37:21.834 --> 37:22.709
ALL KINDS OF FRESH
FINGERPRINT EVIDENCE.

37:22.709 --> 37:24.667
THAT'S GOOD.

37:24.667 --> 37:26.542
FUCKING GUY'S GOT
AN AIRTIGHT ALIBI.

37:26.542 --> 37:27.542
WE CHECKED THE CALL LOGS.

37:27.542 --> 37:29.000
FREEBO CALLED ABBY WILSON
FOUR HOURS

37:29.000 --> 37:31.667
BEFORE THE ESTIMATED TIME
OF TEEGAN'S MURDER.

37:31.667 --> 37:32.750
WE FOLLOWED UP WITH ABBY.

37:32.750 --> 37:34.166
YEAH, BUT GET THIS.

37:34.166 --> 37:35.750
SHE'S SAYING SHE SPENT ALL DAY
IN BED WITH FREEBO.

37:35.750 --> 37:37.041
IF THAT THEORY HOLDS,

37:37.041 --> 37:38.291
THAT MEANS FREEBO
DIDN'T KILL TEEGAN.

37:38.291 --> 37:40.709
AND THERE ARE SEVERAL CALLS
FROM THIS PHONE

37:40.709 --> 37:42.709
TO TEEGAN'S CELL
AFTER  SHE WAS KILLED.

37:42.709 --> 37:44.709
ASSUMING FREEBO MADE
THOSE CALLS,

37:44.709 --> 37:46.083
HE MAY NOT EVEN KNOW
THAT SHE'S DEAD.

37:46.083 --> 37:48.208
WE KNOW JAVIER WAS KILLED
BY THE SAME PERSON

37:48.208 --> 37:49.333
WHO KILLED TEEGAN,
SO...

37:49.333 --> 37:50.375
HE'S OFF THE HOOK
FOR THAT AS WELL.

37:50.375 --> 37:51.583
I WAS JUST TELLING MIGUEL

37:51.583 --> 37:53.291
HOW WE WEREN'T GIVING UP
ON FREEBO.

37:53.291 --> 37:55.041
NOW I HAVE TO CALL HIM
AND TELL HIM

37:55.041 --> 37:56.208
THAT HE'S PROBABLY RIGHT?

37:56.208 --> 37:57.875
FREEBO'S PROBABLY LONG GONE?

37:57.875 --> 37:59.792
LOOKS THAT WAY.

37:59.792 --> 38:01.417
[sighs]
AY!

38:04.375 --> 38:05.875
WHAT IS THAT?

38:05.875 --> 38:08.166
OH...
UM...

38:08.166 --> 38:10.208
YOU STUCK A PIECE
OF CHEWING GUM ON IT?

38:10.208 --> 38:12.208
I'M SORRY.

38:12.208 --> 38:14.875
THIS IS A DELIBERATE INSULT
AGAINST ME,

38:14.875 --> 38:16.208
AND MY PEOPLE!

38:16.208 --> 38:18.250
COME ON!
COME ON!

38:18.250 --> 38:19.959
ASSWIPE.

38:21.125 --> 38:22.333
WHO THE FUCK
ARE HIS PEOPLE?

38:22.333 --> 38:23.500
I DON'T KNOW.

38:23.500 --> 38:25.667
LITTLE SCIENTISTS,
I GUESS.

38:25.667 --> 38:26.667
[laughs]

38:26.667 --> 38:28.500
[sighs]

38:28.500 --> 38:29.542
THE LIEUTENANT'S RIGHT.

38:29.542 --> 38:31.041
WE'RE STARTING
ALL OVER HERE.

38:31.041 --> 38:32.208
WE NEED
TO GET OUT THERE

38:32.208 --> 38:33.583
AND SEE WHAT WE CAN
SHAKE LOOSE.

38:33.583 --> 38:35.125
WE'RE LOOKING
AT TWO CASES NOW.

38:35.125 --> 38:37.750
RAMOS, LIASON
WITH TRI-STATE P.D.

38:37.750 --> 38:39.834
ON THE FREEBO
SITUATION.

38:39.834 --> 38:41.125
QUINN, MORGAN.

38:41.125 --> 38:42.250
YOU STAY
ON THE SKINNER.

38:42.250 --> 38:44.583
AND YOU  NEED
TO MEND FENCES WITH THAT CI.

38:44.583 --> 38:46.083
HE'S PART OF THAT WORLD.

38:46.083 --> 38:47.750
WE NEED ALL THE HELP
WE CAN GET ON THIS.

38:47.750 --> 38:48.750
OKAY?

38:48.750 --> 38:50.375
MM-HMM.

38:50.375 --> 38:52.291
[chuckling]

38:55.583 --> 38:56.625
HEY.

38:56.625 --> 38:58.500
LUCKY BREAK, HUH?

38:58.500 --> 39:00.125
SEEING THAT FLYER?

39:00.125 --> 39:02.291
YOU MAKE YOUR OWN LUCK.

39:07.667 --> 39:10.000
(Dexter)
AND NOW THAT I'VE DEALT
WITH TEEGAN...

39:10.000 --> 39:11.792
[cell rings]

39:13.458 --> 39:14.375
YEP?

39:14.375 --> 39:16.709
HI, IT'S DEXTER.
GOOD NEWS...

39:16.709 --> 39:19.709
I WAS GOING TO CALL YOU.
WE NEED TO MEET.

39:19.709 --> 39:23.291
UH...OKAY.

39:23.291 --> 39:24.583
TODAY,
RIGHT AFTER WORK.

39:24.583 --> 39:26.208
UNDER THE BRIDGE,
NEAR THE BEACH CLUB.

39:27.959 --> 39:29.792
[sighs]

39:39.333 --> 39:40.667
HEY, DEXTER.

39:40.667 --> 39:43.000
MIGUEL.

39:43.000 --> 39:44.834
SO YOU SAID ON THE PHONE
WE HAVE GOOD NEWS.

39:44.834 --> 39:46.625
YES.

39:46.625 --> 39:49.834
IT WAS JUST THE OTHER DAY
THAT I WAS STRESSING

39:49.834 --> 39:53.166
THE IMPORTANCE
OF GETTING THE POLICE

39:53.166 --> 39:55.500
OFF OF
THE FREEBO TRAIL.

39:55.500 --> 39:56.875
AND TODAY...

39:56.875 --> 39:58.667
SUDDENLY...

39:58.667 --> 39:59.834
I GET THE WORD
THAT THE POLICE

39:59.834 --> 40:01.333
HAVE DONE
EXACTLY THAT.

40:03.166 --> 40:05.250
I DON'T KNOW
HOW YOU DID IT, DEXTER,

40:05.250 --> 40:06.709
BUT I'M IMPRESSED.

40:06.709 --> 40:09.166
ACTUALLY,
IT WASN'T ME AT ALL.

40:09.166 --> 40:10.333
IT WAS MY SISTER,
DEBRA.

40:10.333 --> 40:12.333
YOU'RE A LITTLE UNEASY
WITH COMPLIMENTS.

40:12.333 --> 40:13.667
AREN'T YOU?

40:16.208 --> 40:17.917
WE ALL NEED
TO BE LIKED.

40:17.917 --> 40:19.542
I ALSO NOTICE
THAT YOU ALWAYS

40:19.542 --> 40:22.542
HAVE YOUR GUARD UP
AROUND ME.

40:22.542 --> 40:25.542
OH...
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

40:25.542 --> 40:27.542
AH, IT'S OKAY.

40:27.542 --> 40:29.375
ACTUALLY,
IT'S A GOOD THING.

40:29.375 --> 40:31.375
I APPRECIATE
THAT YOU'RE A CAUTIOUS MAN.

40:31.375 --> 40:35.125
IT'S ACTUALLY
A VERY VALUABLE TRAIT TO HAVE,

40:35.125 --> 40:36.917
ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING
OUR CIRCUMSTANCES.

40:36.917 --> 40:39.333
IT'S JUST MY NATURE.

40:39.333 --> 40:40.834
I JUST WANT YOU
TO KNOW

40:40.834 --> 40:42.250
THAT YOU DON'T HAVE
TO WORRY ABOUT ME.

40:42.250 --> 40:44.542
WE'RE ON
THE SAME SIDE HERE.

40:47.417 --> 40:48.375
HONESTLY, I TRY TO AVOID
TAKING SIDES

40:48.375 --> 40:49.667
IN MOST SITUATIONS.

40:49.667 --> 40:50.750
THERE YOU GO
AGAIN.

40:50.750 --> 40:53.041
ALWAYS BEING CAREFUL.

40:53.041 --> 40:54.041
[nervous laughter]

40:54.041 --> 40:55.709
OKAY...

40:55.709 --> 40:58.000
COME ON.

40:58.000 --> 40:59.208
I GOT A GIFT
FOR YOU.

40:59.208 --> 41:00.875
[car beeps]

41:00.875 --> 41:04.583
A GIFT?

41:04.583 --> 41:05.583
YOU KNOW WHEN YOU
TOOK CARE

41:05.583 --> 41:08.500
OF MY BROTHER'S MURDERER,

41:08.500 --> 41:10.417
YOU GAVE ME, UH,
PEACE.

41:10.417 --> 41:11.500
NOW LET ME GIVE YOU PEACE.

41:16.542 --> 41:18.083
A SHIRT?

41:18.083 --> 41:20.458
THE  SHIRT.

41:20.458 --> 41:22.083
THIS IS THE SHIRT
I WAS WEARING

41:22.083 --> 41:23.500
WHEN FREEBO
MET HIS END.

41:30.834 --> 41:32.125
THAT'S HIS BLOOD,
RIGHT THERE.

41:34.375 --> 41:37.125
THIS SHIRT IMPLICATES ME
IN HIS DEATH.

41:37.125 --> 41:38.625
