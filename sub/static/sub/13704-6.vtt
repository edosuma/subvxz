WEBVTT

00:54.521 --> 00:55.922
You'll be a star tonight.

00:56.589 --> 00:57.657
Oh, stop it.

00:58.625 --> 01:00.360
We can all get out of here thanks to you.

01:00.994 --> 01:01.828
I guess you're right.

01:02.629 --> 01:04.864
I suppose I deserve some praise.

01:05.632 --> 01:06.633
There you go again.

01:17.944 --> 01:21.047
Do they already know
that I found all the treasure boxes?

01:21.581 --> 01:24.250
How would they know?
I think they are having a bonfire.

01:25.685 --> 01:26.519
Let's go.

01:28.188 --> 01:32.258
You've all persevered
despite the cold, harsh weather.

01:32.659 --> 01:34.094
Go and get a good night's sleep.

01:34.494 --> 01:39.699
You will wake up at 8:00 a.m.
and board the bus back to school.

01:39.766 --> 01:40.733
Good job.

01:45.672 --> 01:48.808
Hooray for the drill sergeant!

01:52.045 --> 01:53.646
He's awesome!

01:53.713 --> 01:57.083
Sir, I found the last four treasure boxes.

01:57.283 --> 01:58.651
Would you like them now?

02:02.021 --> 02:03.957
I don't know whose they are.

02:15.368 --> 02:18.905
Change for a night march
and gather back here!

02:22.542 --> 02:24.444
Gosh, how dense can you be?

02:31.251 --> 02:32.218
I'm sorry.

02:34.854 --> 02:36.089
I'm so sorry.

02:38.291 --> 02:39.926
You went through a lot to find these.

02:41.161 --> 02:43.163
They should be thanking you.

02:49.669 --> 02:51.237
I'm giving you one last chance
to come clean.

02:54.040 --> 02:56.643
I didn't mess with your mic.

02:57.710 --> 02:58.845
You did it yourself, didn't you?

03:01.915 --> 03:04.250
You made me look like
a cheater and a liar.

03:05.919 --> 03:07.453
Are you going to keep denying

03:09.189 --> 03:10.323
that it wasn't you?

03:13.393 --> 03:15.461
If it turns out that it was you,

03:16.496 --> 03:17.764
as usual, I bet you'll say,

03:20.567 --> 03:21.501
"I'm sorry."

03:36.716 --> 03:38.718
"I practiced the song many times over,

03:39.419 --> 03:41.854
but I got so scared
right before I took the stage.

03:43.923 --> 03:46.626
So I took the batteries out of the mic.

03:49.062 --> 03:51.831
A friend was unfairly framed for it.

03:53.199 --> 03:55.835
I wanted to tell the truth,
but I couldn't find the courage."

03:58.571 --> 03:59.405
Stop it.

04:00.273 --> 04:02.742
"Can I beg God for forgiveness?

04:03.943 --> 04:07.280
Dad, please pray
for your pathetic daughter."

04:09.816 --> 04:10.783
Isn't this...

04:11.918 --> 04:12.919
the letter you wrote?

04:15.021 --> 04:16.756
You wrote it to your dad earlier tonight.

04:28.835 --> 04:29.869
I did write...

04:32.171 --> 04:33.106
that letter.

04:40.146 --> 04:42.615
-Unbelievable.
-How could she?

04:44.917 --> 04:45.752
I'm sorry.

04:57.597 --> 04:58.698
It's too late.

05:04.404 --> 05:05.471
You know what?

05:07.540 --> 05:10.009
People would have no problem
badmouthing someone like me.

05:11.778 --> 05:13.846
However, they would still pity
someone like you

05:14.881 --> 05:16.949
even after you caused trouble
and hurt others.

05:19.419 --> 05:20.653
Do you like being pitied?

05:23.790 --> 05:25.091
Don't you have a sense of shame?

05:27.694 --> 05:29.562
Personally, I prefer being badmouthed.

05:30.730 --> 05:31.931
I held her back.

05:34.133 --> 05:36.436
She wanted to tell the truth,
but I told her not to.

05:38.805 --> 05:39.706
Why?

05:41.174 --> 05:42.842
Because you were no better than her.

05:45.778 --> 05:48.781
Did you ever rehearse
the song with Hae-seong?

05:49.282 --> 05:50.583
Why are you butting in?

05:51.851 --> 05:55.021
I wouldn't have if they had
discussed the issue in private.

05:57.023 --> 05:59.926
Does it feel good to embarrass her
in front of everyone?

06:02.628 --> 06:03.696
All of you...

06:04.797 --> 06:06.532
suspected me of foul play.

06:07.900 --> 06:09.769
I had to reveal the truth
in front of everyone.

06:11.137 --> 06:13.072
Everyone knows like you wanted.
I guess we're done here.

06:21.080 --> 06:22.315
You can run away.

06:24.550 --> 06:26.486
Just like you did from the stage.

06:29.822 --> 06:31.924
Why do you want to be a singer anyway?

06:34.227 --> 06:35.428
If I were you,

06:36.462 --> 06:37.530
I would...

06:38.631 --> 06:39.766
give it up.

07:10.163 --> 07:11.764
I just don't get Shin Hae-seong.

07:11.831 --> 07:13.800
Under the circumstances,
it's hard to take her side.

07:14.200 --> 07:15.034
You don't say.

07:15.468 --> 07:18.538
Even when Rian was wrongfully accused,
she took it in stride.

07:18.604 --> 07:20.106
Wasn't that cool of her?

07:20.673 --> 07:21.541
I know.

07:21.641 --> 07:24.610
She didn't get in our faces
about being framed. She's cool.

07:24.677 --> 07:25.511
Let's go.

07:29.849 --> 07:30.917
JB did?

07:30.983 --> 07:31.818
-Yes.
-Yes.

07:32.051 --> 07:36.122
He asked Mr. Lee to put you
in the accelerated class.

07:36.756 --> 07:37.990
With the rest of us.

07:41.027 --> 07:44.764
-That's not like JB.
-JB always looks out for you.

07:46.499 --> 07:48.000
And what did Mr. Lee say?

07:48.267 --> 07:51.537
He said he would put you in our class
when there's a good opportunity.

07:53.139 --> 07:54.340
When there's a good opportunity?

07:58.478 --> 08:00.580
-She's getting suspended.
-Really?

08:00.646 --> 08:01.881
DISCIPLINARY ACTION

08:02.515 --> 08:03.349
What about it?

08:03.416 --> 08:04.817
-She did it to herself.
-Oh, my.

08:05.218 --> 08:07.320
-She deserves it.
-I know.

08:10.456 --> 08:11.357
SHIN HAE-SEONG, SUSPENDED

08:11.424 --> 08:14.093
THIS STUDENT IS SUSPENDED FOR 15 DAYS
FOR TAKING THE BATTERIES OUT OF HER MIC

08:14.160 --> 08:15.495
AND PRETENDING IT WAS AN ACCIDENT

08:26.038 --> 08:27.240
Only 15 days?

08:51.697 --> 08:52.565
Here.

08:54.433 --> 08:56.569
It's from the treasure box
at the boot camp.

08:58.938 --> 09:00.439
It's yours, right?

09:07.914 --> 09:09.448
I didn't need it anymore,
so I threw it out.

09:12.451 --> 09:14.954
Why don't you sweep this up
while you're at it?

09:17.823 --> 09:21.260
Looks like your knight in shining armor
isn't around to rescue you today.

10:01.500 --> 10:03.469
This cleaner works really well.

10:44.343 --> 10:46.245
Hey!

10:47.413 --> 10:50.750
Hey!

10:51.517 --> 10:53.285
Don't you see me? Hey!

10:53.552 --> 10:57.723
I won't reveal you're my daughter.
Just bear with it for a year.

11:01.627 --> 11:02.728
Mr. Lee.

11:05.598 --> 11:08.668
I would like the chance to teach
high-performing students too.

11:09.835 --> 11:12.805
Aren't the low-level students
just as important?

11:13.172 --> 11:17.476
These are the songs my students submitted
for the music composition assignment.

11:17.576 --> 11:18.944
Please listen to them.

11:19.311 --> 11:23.849
This is just how much I can bring up kids
who knew nothing about music.

11:24.316 --> 11:26.285
If I could work
with the accelerated class,

11:26.352 --> 11:29.055
I would help them improve
at the speed of light.

11:29.121 --> 11:30.022
I'll have a listen.

11:31.657 --> 11:34.060
I'm confident, Mr. Lee.

11:44.036 --> 11:45.137
You startled me.

11:46.806 --> 11:50.009
I'm the only one who survived

11:50.376 --> 11:53.512
Kirin Art School's tumultuous upheavals.

11:54.880 --> 11:56.782
Would you like me to share my secrets?

11:59.952 --> 12:01.754
My outlook is always as follows.

12:02.588 --> 12:05.324
I'm like air.

12:06.959 --> 12:08.427
I stay invisible.

12:10.563 --> 12:12.998
I make sure no one takes notice of me.

12:13.699 --> 12:14.967
That way,

12:15.601 --> 12:18.971
my career will be lackluster
but long-lasting.

12:21.107 --> 12:22.641
Stay invisible?

12:23.843 --> 12:24.977
As far as I can tell,

12:25.478 --> 12:27.379
you seem to be
in the most precarious position.

12:29.482 --> 12:34.353
Can't you sense your long
and tenuous career coming to an end?

12:34.420 --> 12:35.821
Look at what happened to Principal Ju.

12:49.068 --> 12:53.205
Principal Ju Jeong-wan
left the school yesterday.

12:54.039 --> 12:56.375
Until we get a new principal,

12:57.076 --> 12:59.545
I'll be temporarily carrying out
the duties of the principal.

12:59.845 --> 13:00.980
That's all for today.

13:02.915 --> 13:04.183
My goodness.

13:07.186 --> 13:10.589
-Why aren't you at school?
-You're not at school either.

13:12.057 --> 13:14.460
Where do you think you're sneaking into?
Hey!

13:16.362 --> 13:18.297
Good grief.

13:22.434 --> 13:24.436
-Why did you quit?
-What?

13:26.172 --> 13:28.174
And why did you lend me the money?

13:28.240 --> 13:30.075
Because I have too much of it.

13:32.044 --> 13:33.546
Sure looks like it.

13:34.513 --> 13:36.549
Your impudence knows no bounds.

13:37.183 --> 13:38.951
You got the boot, didn't you?

13:41.854 --> 13:43.088
Why did you get fired?

13:43.856 --> 13:45.257
Were you that incompetent?

13:46.592 --> 13:47.459
Yu-jin.

13:49.295 --> 13:50.296
Listen, Jin Yu-jin.

13:51.063 --> 13:52.398
Let me be straight with you.

13:53.032 --> 13:53.999
You know,

13:55.467 --> 13:57.503
dealing with you alone
is already too much for me.

13:58.437 --> 14:00.206
That proves
that I'm not fit to be a teacher.

14:00.739 --> 14:03.342
That's why I quit.

14:05.578 --> 14:08.714
But let me impart my final words of wisdom
to you.

14:11.984 --> 14:13.385
Do you want to end up like me?

14:14.653 --> 14:15.521
Well?

14:17.256 --> 14:18.090
No, right?

14:20.292 --> 14:23.562
Go back to school
and focus on your studies, all right?

14:27.933 --> 14:28.767
Hey.

14:38.711 --> 14:39.645
Here's your guitar.

14:40.846 --> 14:41.914
And don't ever come back.

14:44.917 --> 14:48.287
I don't believe a word you said.

14:51.357 --> 14:52.591
Don't you ever come back here.

14:54.827 --> 14:56.428
What a way to start the day.

15:00.966 --> 15:02.034
Listen up, everyone.

15:02.401 --> 15:04.203
For your sakes...

15:04.803 --> 15:07.306
we've decided to expand
the dormitory building!

15:22.288 --> 15:25.524
It's normally two to a room,
but during the construction,

15:25.591 --> 15:26.926
your room situation will stay as is.

15:27.192 --> 15:30.462
That is, rooms housing
new or transfer students

15:30.729 --> 15:33.432
will be three or four to a room
for the time being.

15:34.800 --> 15:37.336
What is this? A tenement?

15:38.137 --> 15:39.638
They keep changing words.

15:40.139 --> 15:42.474
But you would have gotten kicked out too

15:43.175 --> 15:44.677
since you're also in the low-level class.

15:56.155 --> 15:56.989
What the...

16:03.062 --> 16:04.096
Where's my bed?

16:06.598 --> 16:08.567
This is a room, not a taxi.

16:10.002 --> 16:11.236
It can't hold four people.

16:14.006 --> 16:16.475
So there are only two beds?

16:19.645 --> 16:20.846
You're a royal pain.

16:23.215 --> 16:24.450
You're a loner.

16:28.053 --> 16:29.722
You seem the most normal.

16:31.357 --> 16:32.424
Let's share a bed.

16:34.093 --> 16:35.361
A good judge of character.

16:35.861 --> 16:36.695
Hey,

16:37.763 --> 16:38.864
get out of here right now.

16:39.865 --> 16:41.233
Squat in someone else's room.

16:58.350 --> 16:59.318
Which one is your bed?

17:00.586 --> 17:02.721
You can split apples with your bare hands?

17:05.224 --> 17:06.258
Get out of here!

17:24.743 --> 17:25.911
Shut your mouth, will you?

17:50.736 --> 17:51.603
Hey!

17:52.638 --> 17:53.906
Wake up right now.

17:57.643 --> 17:58.477
JB!

17:58.911 --> 18:00.646
Hey! Wake up.

18:03.048 --> 18:04.116
What does this mean?

18:11.423 --> 18:13.025
It means
that if you want to break bad habits,

18:14.326 --> 18:15.994
you need to study
the habits of role models.

18:25.471 --> 18:27.706
You seem to be in the most
precarious position.

18:28.607 --> 18:31.844
Can't you sense your long
and tenuous career coming to an end?

18:32.177 --> 18:33.545
Look at what happened to Principal Ju.

18:48.093 --> 18:49.661
Sorry to interrupt.

18:50.896 --> 18:54.233
We're in the middle of class. We are...

18:55.300 --> 18:57.903
The class really ought
to go on uninterrupted.

19:00.405 --> 19:03.342
This is your new native English teacher.

19:10.249 --> 19:11.683
You can get introduced later.

19:12.284 --> 19:15.087
For now, could I have a word
with the students listed here?

19:15.521 --> 19:18.123
PARK SUN-DONG, PARK HONG-JU,
JEONG UI-BONG, LEE NA-YEONG

19:19.658 --> 19:20.492
JEONG UI-BONG, NA-YEONG

19:25.764 --> 19:26.865
These are the ones

19:27.432 --> 19:29.668
you submitted
for the composition assignment, right?

19:30.435 --> 19:31.436
-Yes.
-Yes.

19:31.503 --> 19:33.872
Who wrote these for you?

19:34.373 --> 19:36.208
We wrote them ourselves.

19:38.377 --> 19:41.346
These were all written by a single person.

19:41.413 --> 19:42.681
It's so obvious.

19:45.083 --> 19:46.118
Who wrote them?

19:48.353 --> 19:52.724
If we had to call your parents here,
whose loss would that be?

19:55.561 --> 19:57.129
Let me ask you again. Who wrote these?

19:58.030 --> 19:59.598
Jin Yu-jin, sir.

19:59.665 --> 20:01.600
-Who?
-Jin Yu-jin, sir.

20:01.667 --> 20:03.502
-Who?
-Jin Yu-jin, sir.

20:14.580 --> 20:17.616
Why did Principal Ju quit?

20:18.584 --> 20:23.121
Since when have students cared about
school personnel changes?

20:23.188 --> 20:25.257
It concerns me personally.

20:26.124 --> 20:28.427
Was it because of us?
Since we're not good enough?

20:29.895 --> 20:31.797
I'm sure he had his reasons.

20:33.065 --> 20:34.967
Are you sure you didn't make him quit?

20:37.636 --> 20:38.670
JIN YU-JIN

20:39.972 --> 20:42.774
So, you're Jin Yu-jin.

20:43.809 --> 20:46.011
Why are you so worried about
that money-grubber?

20:49.982 --> 20:51.049
What do you mean?

20:52.284 --> 20:55.854
He said he was strapped,
so I lent him money, then he just left.

20:57.856 --> 21:01.893
Don't waste time and energy
on something worthless.

21:02.160 --> 21:03.895
You need to live wisely.

21:21.680 --> 21:23.282
Did he borrow money
for my settlement payment?

21:24.983 --> 21:28.020
Did he really have to overstep his bounds?

21:39.031 --> 21:41.700
-Will you sell it for three million won?
-For three million won?

21:41.767 --> 21:43.568
If you want to negotiate,
you can just take it back.

21:44.870 --> 21:46.004
Is that the best you can offer?

21:48.707 --> 21:49.541
Fine.

21:49.941 --> 21:52.911
Just don't sell it to anyone.
I'll be back for it soon.

21:52.978 --> 21:55.013
Put down a deposit then.

21:55.080 --> 21:57.749
If I had money for a deposit,
why would I sell my guitar?

22:12.764 --> 22:13.899
Sun-dong.

22:15.834 --> 22:18.637
I'm starving. Let's eat.

22:19.504 --> 22:23.241
Sorry, I promised some friends
I would go out to lunch with them.

22:25.777 --> 22:28.180
Enjoy your lunch. Bring me the leftovers
if there are any.

22:28.246 --> 22:30.315
Okay. Enjoy your lunch.

22:37.422 --> 22:39.925
My coffee... You should be more careful.

23:06.318 --> 23:09.421
-Okay, it starts now.
-No, we did it already.

23:10.021 --> 23:10.889
Let's do it again.

23:11.323 --> 23:13.925
-Rock, paper, scissors, shoot.
-Rock, paper, scissors, shoot.

23:16.862 --> 23:18.997
SELL GUITAR FOR THREE MILLION WON
SEVEN MILLION WON TO OWE

23:19.064 --> 23:19.931
Yes!

23:34.813 --> 23:36.248
Would you like to do a street concert?

23:42.888 --> 23:45.056
It makes no sense
that we're in the low-level class.

23:45.123 --> 23:46.057
Does it make sense?

23:46.124 --> 23:48.126
It makes absolutely no sense.

23:49.895 --> 23:52.631
I went to see Mr. Lee,
risking myself getting expelled.

23:53.732 --> 23:55.600
Really? What happened?

23:56.635 --> 23:59.337
I told him we would do well too
if we could do things our way.

23:59.404 --> 24:02.174
You should have seen his face
when I said that.

24:02.874 --> 24:04.242
It was so obvious that he was wavering.

24:04.743 --> 24:06.545
When I noticed his hesitation,

24:07.078 --> 24:08.947
I proposed a deal.

24:11.016 --> 24:13.418
I asked what he would do for us
if we could knock his socks off.

24:15.053 --> 24:19.224
I could totally tell
that Mr. Lee fell for my audacity.

24:20.325 --> 24:22.027
-Really?
-Really?

24:23.328 --> 24:24.830
You're bluffing again.

24:27.866 --> 24:30.135
Fine. Whatever. Forget about it.

24:31.369 --> 24:34.973
Didn't you get called over to his office
because of the CDs?

24:36.241 --> 24:37.576
CDs? What CDs?

24:38.443 --> 24:41.246
The composition assignment you sold us.

24:41.580 --> 24:42.948
He caught on.

24:43.415 --> 24:44.883
Didn't he say anything to you?

24:46.284 --> 24:47.185
No.

24:49.955 --> 24:55.393
He must have recognized my talent
after listening to my compositions.

24:56.962 --> 24:57.996
So that's what happened.

25:01.800 --> 25:04.135
So, what did Mr. Lee say?

25:07.305 --> 25:08.673
He said we could do things our way,

25:09.774 --> 25:11.676
and if we impress him,

25:13.645 --> 25:18.083
he'll put everything
back to the way it was.

25:23.255 --> 25:24.189
Really?

25:26.358 --> 25:27.592
We can do a fundraiser show.

25:29.761 --> 25:31.096
What for?

25:32.964 --> 25:34.199
To help the needy.

25:36.134 --> 25:37.235
It's for a good cause too.

25:38.003 --> 25:41.006
Let's do a street concert
to restore our honor.

25:44.910 --> 25:45.744
Let's do it.

25:47.312 --> 25:48.179
Shall we?

25:50.682 --> 25:51.683
I'll help.

25:53.919 --> 25:55.287
Can I join in too?

25:59.724 --> 26:00.892
I'm sorry, but no...

26:02.994 --> 26:03.862
Mr. Yang.

26:07.098 --> 26:08.667
You're an English teacher.

26:14.739 --> 26:16.207
Do you have a place to rehearse?

26:33.291 --> 26:36.628
Let's focus on just one song.
This one's not that hard.

26:44.336 --> 26:45.537
You've exceeded your credit limit.

26:57.616 --> 26:58.450
Okay.

26:59.517 --> 27:02.053
There's only one thing
you have to keep in mind.

27:03.922 --> 27:05.290
Survival of the fittest.

27:06.625 --> 27:09.995
It's a jungle out there.

27:10.061 --> 27:12.998
You shouldn't assume
that trying not to stand out

27:13.064 --> 27:14.466
would let you secure your place.

27:15.100 --> 27:17.268
I would no longer do that.

27:18.003 --> 27:21.139
Eat or be eaten. It's one or the other.

27:21.806 --> 27:23.308
You have to be the predator.

27:23.642 --> 27:24.843
-Mr. Yang.
-Yes?

27:25.310 --> 27:27.245
What's all this about eating?

27:27.312 --> 27:29.147
That native English teacher
is trying to...

27:31.383 --> 27:34.152
My point here
is that we need to survive this.

28:00.378 --> 28:03.782
It's okay, everything will be fine

28:11.956 --> 28:14.959
It's not going to be okay
if you sing like that.

28:19.330 --> 28:20.298
My goodness.

28:23.301 --> 28:24.469
Can't you read music?

28:24.736 --> 28:26.304
It's an unfamiliar song.

28:27.338 --> 28:30.175
How can I just sight-read?

28:30.608 --> 28:31.943
Isn't that a basic skill?

28:33.445 --> 28:34.546
Let me give it another go.

28:35.213 --> 28:36.247
Try doing it alone.

28:39.317 --> 28:40.151
Okay.

28:40.919 --> 28:42.687
Where should I start?

28:44.322 --> 28:45.156
From the top.

29:04.309 --> 29:05.944
Get rid of the vibration.

29:06.544 --> 29:07.612
You have no control over it.

29:09.514 --> 29:11.583
Make it sound clean.

29:13.518 --> 29:15.687
-Okay.
-And louder.

29:16.387 --> 29:18.823
You should be the lead,
but you're being drowned out.

29:20.158 --> 29:20.992
Okay.

29:22.794 --> 29:24.729
What? Are you upset?

29:25.897 --> 29:26.998
No.

29:29.567 --> 29:31.936
I just don't know what's wrong with me.

29:34.506 --> 29:37.609
Tell me if there's anything else
I'm doing wrong.

29:38.276 --> 29:39.277
I'll start again.

29:54.726 --> 29:55.860
I'm starving.

29:58.596 --> 29:59.430
Let's go.

29:59.497 --> 30:01.699
I'm sorry.

30:01.766 --> 30:03.268
I'll get going first.

30:04.536 --> 30:06.304
We have to practice more after dinner.

30:07.038 --> 30:10.175
Sorry. I have cleaning to finish.

30:10.642 --> 30:13.511
Is cleaning important to you
when your survival is at stake?

30:13.611 --> 30:14.445
Pardon?

30:14.846 --> 30:17.215
We're a band, how can you
miss the practice?

30:17.515 --> 30:19.017
Will you always be leaving early?

30:20.485 --> 30:23.922
I'll practice really hard
before the next rehearsal.

30:24.756 --> 30:26.357
You can't do this.

30:27.325 --> 30:29.794
United we stand, divided we fall.

30:31.396 --> 30:34.766
-We'll get eaten by them.
-I'm sorry.

30:37.702 --> 30:38.903
Fine. If you have to go, just go.

30:38.970 --> 30:40.538
Let's eat quickly
and come back for practice.

30:40.605 --> 30:41.973
-Okay.
-Let's go.

30:42.040 --> 30:43.208
-Let's eat.
-Let's go, guys.

30:43.274 --> 30:44.309
-I'm so hungry.
-Let's go.

30:46.411 --> 30:47.545
What's with you all of a sudden?

30:49.113 --> 30:51.850
-What do you mean?
-Why are you so compliant?

30:59.657 --> 31:00.725
Record yourself and listen.

31:03.261 --> 31:05.463
You have to realize
how painful your singing is

31:06.197 --> 31:07.832
to other people's ears.

31:23.181 --> 31:24.015
Who...

31:25.516 --> 31:26.684
did this?

31:28.486 --> 31:30.788
Our new roommate said
she had no room for her stuff

31:30.855 --> 31:34.125
because you had too much of your things.

31:34.192 --> 31:36.794
Eventually, she threw a tantrum,
like this.

31:38.763 --> 31:40.732
Who does she think she is?

31:41.900 --> 31:44.435
I'll talk to Mr. Lee
or the dorm supervisor

31:46.437 --> 31:48.072
and get her kicked out of here.

31:50.074 --> 31:51.676
Darn it.

32:35.153 --> 32:37.021
I have to clean here.

32:39.424 --> 32:40.258
What?

32:40.792 --> 32:41.726
Nothing.

32:43.461 --> 32:45.897
You said you had to clean, so go ahead.

32:46.364 --> 32:47.665
I'm done.

32:49.701 --> 32:53.004
If you heard me, why pretend you didn't?

32:58.009 --> 32:59.177
I wore out another pair.

33:12.557 --> 33:15.193
Let me give it a try just once.
I'll give it back in a minute.

33:15.493 --> 33:16.928
You can solve it in a minute?

33:17.695 --> 33:18.563
This?

33:19.864 --> 33:22.233
Why not try solving it in 30 seconds
while you're at it?

33:22.834 --> 33:24.969
I've never tried to get it done
in 30 seconds.

33:26.204 --> 33:28.806
Can you really solve it in a minute?

33:28.873 --> 33:31.275
Yes. Time me if you'd like to.

33:47.692 --> 33:48.659
How did you do it?

33:49.627 --> 33:51.229
I've never once solved it.

33:51.863 --> 33:52.697
What?

33:53.664 --> 33:56.601
Not even once?
You've had it for two years.

33:57.702 --> 34:00.471
How did you know
I've had this for two years?

34:05.410 --> 34:07.011
I used to be your fan.

34:07.945 --> 34:11.749
All your fans know
you carry this around all the time.

34:15.453 --> 34:17.989
You must have been
just fiddling around with it

34:19.424 --> 34:23.261
without actually trying
to solve the puzzle.

34:23.628 --> 34:25.029
No wonder you never managed to solve it.

34:52.957 --> 34:54.392
Hae-seong!

34:55.993 --> 34:58.296
How many times are you going to
mess up the same part?

34:58.596 --> 34:59.630
I'm sorry.

34:59.831 --> 35:03.434
This is not good. What should we do?

35:04.735 --> 35:05.603
Was it...

35:06.637 --> 35:08.539
that bad?

35:08.606 --> 35:09.740
Yes.

35:12.176 --> 35:13.177
Did you practice?

35:14.512 --> 35:15.413
Yes.

35:15.746 --> 35:17.381
You practiced,
but you have not improved a bit.

35:19.684 --> 35:21.252
Did you use that digital recorder
I lent you?

35:22.820 --> 35:23.654
Yes.

35:24.055 --> 35:25.890
What did you realize
after hearing yourself sing?

35:26.557 --> 35:29.160
Shouldn't you have made
some kind of improvement?

35:29.227 --> 35:30.728
You're making things hard for everyone.

35:32.196 --> 35:36.434
Music is about enjoyment.
You don't need to be so harsh.

35:37.034 --> 35:38.936
Forget about enjoyment.
It's the basics I'm asking for.

35:39.504 --> 35:42.106
The audience shouldn't be able to tell
you are nervous.

35:44.976 --> 35:46.511
How about this?

35:47.044 --> 35:50.648
Let's practice on the street this Sunday.

35:52.416 --> 35:53.251
Pardon?

35:53.985 --> 35:57.054
We'll practice on the street
and see how people respond.

35:57.522 --> 36:00.525
Hands-on experience
is the best way to learn.

36:00.858 --> 36:02.527
How can we perform like this?

36:02.693 --> 36:05.863
We don't have time to dilly-dally.

36:05.930 --> 36:07.899
We'll get eaten if we don't hurry up.

36:11.536 --> 36:14.639
-See you again.
-See you again.

36:16.908 --> 36:17.742
Wait.

36:19.777 --> 36:21.078
I don't know

36:21.979 --> 36:24.015
why you have to be this harsh on me.

36:24.081 --> 36:25.483
You need to do well

36:26.784 --> 36:28.352
if you don't want people
to look down on you.

36:30.421 --> 36:31.355
That's all there is to it.

36:41.799 --> 36:43.467
What are you doing today?

36:45.002 --> 36:46.070
I'm going home.

36:49.473 --> 36:50.608
That's good.

36:51.175 --> 36:53.945
I was worried you would want to have
a party or something.

36:55.680 --> 36:57.782
I have dinner plans with my family anyway.

36:58.282 --> 36:59.150
Party?

37:00.284 --> 37:01.385
What's the occasion?

37:05.356 --> 37:06.224
Never mind.

37:12.396 --> 37:15.099
Right, like you're really going to spend
your birthday with your family.

37:16.701 --> 37:19.103
A surprise party? That's so lame.

37:19.971 --> 37:21.205
Rian won't fall for it.

37:21.739 --> 37:23.808
She's actually quite gullible.

37:24.075 --> 37:26.110
-You're coming, right?
-No.

37:26.911 --> 37:28.012
You guys have fun.

37:30.481 --> 37:33.317
Come on. JB said he would be there.

37:36.187 --> 37:37.355
That's why I don't want to go.

37:47.198 --> 37:50.034
It's not like the agency
made a definite decision to drop you.

37:50.968 --> 37:53.838
If you keep doing your own thing,
you'll end up becoming a loner.

38:02.647 --> 38:03.581
Are you nuts?

38:10.955 --> 38:12.423
Are you coming or not?

38:13.557 --> 38:14.959
I'll get people's attention.

38:16.093 --> 38:16.927
Give me that.

38:19.864 --> 38:21.132
-One...
-One.

38:22.433 --> 38:23.601
-two.
-Two.

38:24.635 --> 38:27.505
-Si-u's shirtless.
-Stop it! Fine, I'll come.

38:43.654 --> 38:45.189
What good are all these things to me?

38:50.961 --> 38:52.630
Ta-da. How do I look?

38:52.963 --> 38:56.033
Your fans have a great sense of fashion.

38:56.434 --> 38:57.335
Thanks.

38:59.670 --> 39:00.805
Where are you going?

39:01.505 --> 39:04.241
We're rehearsing on the street.
You should come.

39:04.308 --> 39:06.477
I'll get the band to play
"Happy Birthday" for you.

39:08.212 --> 39:09.613
"Happy Birthday..."

39:22.760 --> 39:23.627
Where's Rian?

39:23.694 --> 39:26.964
She wasn't in the dorm either.
She must really be upset.

39:27.565 --> 39:28.833
There's no way we can reach her.

39:32.970 --> 39:33.838
Go look for her.

39:36.207 --> 39:37.441
That's what I was about to do.

39:42.213 --> 39:48.285
RIAN! WE NEED TO CELEBRATE YOUR BIRTHDAY.

39:48.819 --> 39:49.653
Hey, Hong-ju.

39:49.720 --> 39:51.689
Just play it cool, okay?

39:51.756 --> 39:52.857
You're about to perform.

39:52.923 --> 39:55.559
-Remember what I told you?
-Survival of the fittest.

39:57.328 --> 40:00.464
You get my drift, right? Relax, okay?

40:01.198 --> 40:04.368
Hae-seong, you need to relax.
You need to sing like a professional.

40:04.435 --> 40:06.237
-Okay.
-You seem a bit nervous.

40:07.772 --> 40:08.939
-I can do this!
-Relax.

40:10.307 --> 40:11.275
Yu-jin. You're good, right?

40:13.277 --> 40:15.679
-Drive it home. Got it?
-Got it.

40:16.113 --> 40:17.748
-Okay. You're cool, right?
-Yes.

40:18.382 --> 40:19.784
-Ui-bong.
-Yes.

40:22.086 --> 40:23.921
You're all decked out today.

40:24.221 --> 40:26.390
You think so? Rian gave this to me.

40:26.791 --> 40:30.561
Getting to know her, she's actually
not that bad. It's cute, isn't it?

40:31.061 --> 40:32.229
You don't look bad yourself.

40:38.702 --> 40:39.837
Oh, my god!

40:43.741 --> 40:46.577
RIAN SPOTTED IN HONGDAE AREA

40:52.917 --> 40:53.918
Aren't you guys performing?

40:55.786 --> 40:57.455
I was just passing by.

41:01.358 --> 41:03.260
Go ahead.
Might as well hear what you can do.

41:04.462 --> 41:05.629
HONGDAE STATION, EXIT NUMBER ONE

41:06.096 --> 41:07.064
Found her.

41:10.267 --> 41:12.002
She's near the exit number one
of Hongdae station.

41:12.069 --> 41:13.337
What street performance though?

41:19.176 --> 41:20.010
What?

41:20.911 --> 41:21.879
Let's go.

41:22.413 --> 41:23.747
Yes. Let's go.

41:24.114 --> 41:24.949
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

41:25.015 --> 41:26.116
You guys can go.

41:42.867 --> 41:45.102
Thanks to you, a huge crowd has gathered.

41:46.103 --> 41:47.037
Hooray for idols!

41:49.073 --> 41:52.243
-Isn't Rian singing?
-Rian's not singing?

41:52.309 --> 41:54.778
I've been waiting all this time
because I wanted to hear her sing.

41:54.845 --> 41:56.347
-Me too.
-Isn't she singing?

41:56.914 --> 42:03.220
-Sing!
-Sing!

42:03.487 --> 42:08.792
-Sing!
-Sing!

42:08.859 --> 42:13.697
-Sing!
-Sing!

42:13.764 --> 42:15.866
-Would you like to sing?
-Why not?

42:31.015 --> 42:32.616
Is this a joke to you?

42:34.685 --> 42:36.387
We're just practicing anyway.

42:38.489 --> 42:40.724
-The crowd wants her.
-Hey!

42:41.091 --> 42:44.161
I'm sure they'll get mad at me
if I start singing.

43:07.918 --> 43:12.656
-Rian!
-Rian!

43:12.723 --> 43:16.627
-Rian!
-Rian!

45:29.760 --> 45:31.695
-Oh, my!
-He threw something.

45:35.399 --> 45:37.234
-What is it?
-Did you see that?

45:58.789 --> 46:01.792
SHARE THEM WITH YOUR FRIENDS, FROM DAD

46:18.342 --> 46:20.043
Rian's not back yet?

46:21.512 --> 46:22.446
No.

46:25.182 --> 46:26.750
Have her come to the studio
when she gets in.

46:27.417 --> 46:28.652
I have to clean--

46:40.864 --> 46:43.467
Wasn't this the place?
Where did she disappear off to again?

46:43.534 --> 46:45.669
All we've done today is look for Rian.

46:46.837 --> 46:49.506
I told you a surprise party
wasn't a good idea.

46:56.880 --> 46:58.582
It's on the house, so eat your fill.

46:59.483 --> 47:02.052
On the house? What are you talking about?

47:02.286 --> 47:04.988
Fine. Eat up before it gets cold.

47:05.055 --> 47:07.024
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

47:16.567 --> 47:18.302
Aren't you eating?

47:19.203 --> 47:20.037
Here.

47:24.374 --> 47:25.242
Enjoy.

47:26.944 --> 47:28.979
I've never seen an anti-fan in person.

47:29.046 --> 47:30.247
He was scary.

47:30.314 --> 47:32.082
An anti-fan is no fan.

47:32.482 --> 47:34.818
I got a dead rat as a present,

47:36.954 --> 47:38.922
a roadkill pigeon,

47:40.090 --> 47:41.558
ten cockroaches...

47:43.026 --> 47:44.027
That's enough.

47:44.394 --> 47:45.229
But...

47:46.430 --> 47:48.198
that's better than apathy, right?

47:48.498 --> 47:51.034
Jerks like him should have
the same thing done to them.

47:55.239 --> 47:56.607
Eat up.

48:04.848 --> 48:05.682
I know

48:07.684 --> 48:09.453
you were being mean

48:12.022 --> 48:14.124
to motivate me.

48:15.092 --> 48:15.993
I really do.

48:19.029 --> 48:22.866
That's what you thought I would say,
didn't you, you nasty freak?

48:23.600 --> 48:26.203
You go back and forth with me
like a crazy person.

48:27.504 --> 48:29.806
Do you think

48:31.441 --> 48:34.144
being looked down on is easy for me?

48:36.213 --> 48:39.750
To people who are born talented
like you, I'm just a...

49:11.014 --> 49:12.983
One, two, three, four.

49:13.483 --> 49:17.120
If we ever get to

49:17.454 --> 49:19.790
Meet again

49:21.358 --> 49:25.028
We should promise that

49:25.095 --> 49:28.799
We'll put on a smile
When we see each other

49:30.233 --> 49:34.104
With that in mind

49:34.304 --> 49:36.873
We should celebrate this special day

49:36.940 --> 49:38.141
Keep going.

49:38.208 --> 49:41.545
-This song I dedicate
-To whom?

49:41.611 --> 49:44.748
-To you
-To you

50:15.312 --> 50:16.680
That's not the least bit funny.

50:34.731 --> 50:36.900
-Darn it.
-Why did you stop?

50:37.367 --> 50:40.704
This isn't my style.
What's the big deal with birthdays anyway?

50:43.707 --> 50:44.541
Don't laugh.

50:48.111 --> 50:50.213
Don't. Your timing is off.

50:53.283 --> 50:54.384
Just blow out the candles.

50:54.985 --> 50:56.119
If you don't, I will.

51:37.494 --> 51:39.596
-Happy birthday, Rian.
-Happy birthday!

51:42.666 --> 51:45.469
Happy birthday. More cola for everyone.

51:45.669 --> 51:47.070
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

51:47.137 --> 51:48.839
How lame.

51:49.439 --> 51:50.273
What?

51:51.174 --> 51:53.076
Don't birthdays call
for something stronger than cola?

51:54.244 --> 51:56.446
Do you want a beating with a cola bottle?

51:56.513 --> 51:57.514
I'm sorry, sir.

51:58.181 --> 51:59.316
-Drink the cola.
-Yes.

51:59.382 --> 52:01.118
-Drink.
-Yes, sir.

52:01.685 --> 52:02.586
Let's drink.

52:05.021 --> 52:06.723
Let's drink. Do you want some?

52:17.968 --> 52:18.802
Where are you going?

52:27.010 --> 52:28.111
To the dorm.

52:29.513 --> 52:31.414
Because you're worried about
Shin Hae-seong?

52:34.084 --> 52:35.919
No. I need to get changed.

52:49.799 --> 52:50.700
About earlier...

52:53.036 --> 52:54.104
Thank you.

53:20.363 --> 53:25.435
Would you please think of me
Who used to dream right here?

53:26.670 --> 53:29.339
Would you please smile at me

53:29.873 --> 53:32.475
And tell me to get back up and try again?

53:32.676 --> 53:37.847
Please tell me that I can do it

53:45.388 --> 53:47.357
I'll stop here for now.

53:49.192 --> 53:50.961
The lyrics for the next verse are...

53:56.566 --> 53:59.603
This is the song you had asked me
to arrange, right?

54:00.437 --> 54:03.139
How long have you been there?

54:04.908 --> 54:06.276
Did you hear everything?

54:09.646 --> 54:10.547
Sing the rest.

54:11.181 --> 54:12.082
I'm curious.

54:25.362 --> 54:28.431
Weren't you heading to the dorm?

54:29.032 --> 54:30.834
I'm going to the studio.

54:31.401 --> 54:32.235
What for?

54:33.336 --> 54:34.170
Well...

54:35.138 --> 54:37.274
What about you?
Why are you here at this late hour?

54:39.009 --> 54:40.010
I...

54:41.511 --> 54:42.846
have to look for something.

54:52.722 --> 54:56.960
How does it feel to achieve your dreams?

54:57.260 --> 55:01.865
Does it really not hurt
When you pinch yourself?

55:03.466 --> 55:09.139
You probably find it boring

55:09.706 --> 55:13.043
Now that it has become your new normal

55:14.244 --> 55:19.249
If you ever feel lonely or down

55:20.283 --> 55:25.588
Would you please think of me
Who used to dream right here?

55:26.589 --> 55:29.492
Would you please smile at me

55:29.726 --> 55:32.329
And tell me to get back up and try again?

55:32.562 --> 55:37.267
I hope your heart overflows with happiness

55:41.871 --> 55:46.076
It's December 2011

55:46.343 --> 55:49.679
It's a cold, cold winter

56:15.238 --> 56:16.473
What are you doing?

56:28.985 --> 56:30.553
It's always one thing
after another with you.

56:48.138 --> 56:51.074
-We need to talk.
-What's there to talk about?

56:53.009 --> 56:54.444
I knew today was your birthday all along.

56:55.912 --> 56:57.414
What's the big deal with birthdays anyway?

56:57.981 --> 57:00.250
I don't care
whether you remembered or not.

57:00.917 --> 57:01.851
By the way,

57:03.019 --> 57:04.754
your standards have dropped really low.

57:05.855 --> 57:07.690
How could you be listening
to someone like her sing?

57:08.458 --> 57:09.359
What about you?

57:10.527 --> 57:11.795
I heard you performed on the street.

57:12.929 --> 57:14.631
Shouldn't you worry about your reputation?

57:15.064 --> 57:16.099
It was fun.

57:17.033 --> 57:19.068
Jin Yu-jin and I are vocally compatible.

57:20.403 --> 57:22.806
Now I see why Mr. Lee
is interested in him.

57:25.642 --> 57:26.643
Oh, right.

57:27.343 --> 57:28.711
You must not have heard.

57:30.280 --> 57:32.782
Mr. Lee has his eye on Jin Yu-jin.

57:34.684 --> 57:35.952
Get it together.

57:36.853 --> 57:38.888
You're in no position
to be putzing around.

57:40.790 --> 57:42.525
-Are you done?
-No.

57:43.993 --> 57:46.396
Come see our show if you have the time.

57:48.064 --> 57:49.632
-"Our show"?
-Yes.

57:51.034 --> 57:52.969
It was going to be
a one-time thing for me,

57:55.071 --> 57:56.940
but someone made me want to stick to it.

58:00.443 --> 58:02.378
How much longer will you keep this up?

58:06.616 --> 58:07.750
You're the one who started it.

58:19.229 --> 58:23.066
Was coming here the best thing you could
think of after handing your mic to Rian?

58:25.368 --> 58:26.269
I should've known.

58:27.270 --> 58:28.571
You were a die-hard JB fan.

58:30.006 --> 58:31.641
I don't want to argue with you.

58:33.042 --> 58:34.811
When are you going to stop running away?

58:36.846 --> 58:39.816
Don't pretend that you care about me.

58:41.317 --> 58:43.152
I was confused for a while,

58:44.454 --> 58:45.922
but now I know.

58:47.457 --> 58:50.760
You think I'm a pushover,
so you play games with me.

58:54.197 --> 58:58.434
You were having a ball with Rian on stage,

59:00.236 --> 59:03.973
so what do you care what I've been doing?

59:05.074 --> 59:07.377
Are you getting jealous when it was you
who gave up your own spot?

59:09.612 --> 59:11.314
You didn't say a peep earlier.

59:12.015 --> 59:13.816
Why get mad and complain now?

59:15.418 --> 59:17.253
You have a knack for doing
all the wrong things.

59:21.324 --> 59:22.158
So...

59:23.326 --> 59:24.727
are you going to perform with us or not?

59:26.963 --> 59:27.997
Do it with Rian.

59:31.100 --> 59:31.935
Okay then.

59:32.869 --> 59:33.836
This is so like you.

59:35.371 --> 59:36.306
It is.

59:36.472 --> 59:37.740
This is so like Shin Hae-seong.

1:00:04.901 --> 1:00:06.502
Can't you throw this out?

1:00:08.504 --> 1:00:10.506
You said you were no longer a JB fan.

1:00:11.608 --> 1:00:13.977
Are you still hesitating?

1:00:14.043 --> 1:00:16.112
Can't you see I'm sleeping on the floor
because of you?

1:00:16.579 --> 1:00:19.215
Why can't you just leave me alone?

1:00:23.019 --> 1:00:23.987
Hey, Loner.

1:00:25.221 --> 1:00:26.456
Take it outside.

1:00:26.889 --> 1:00:28.224
Watch what you say.

1:00:31.628 --> 1:00:32.595
Jeez.

1:00:36.933 --> 1:00:39.469
Hold yourself back no matter what.

1:00:39.535 --> 1:00:41.204
Why do I have to keep holding back?

1:00:41.404 --> 1:00:42.438
Let go.

1:00:55.418 --> 1:00:56.619
Run.

1:00:56.686 --> 1:00:58.788
You have to swallow your pride
if you want to avoid trouble.

1:00:59.022 --> 1:01:00.556
-Why?
-Run.

1:01:00.623 --> 1:01:01.524
Hey!

1:01:04.127 --> 1:01:04.961
What's going on?

1:01:22.245 --> 1:01:24.747
-What's this?
-Who put this in my locker?

1:01:25.048 --> 1:01:25.882
I don't know.

1:01:27.884 --> 1:01:29.452
-I have one too.
-Really?

1:01:29.519 --> 1:01:30.453
You got one too?

1:01:34.390 --> 1:01:36.959
-Rian's not back yet?
-No.

1:01:40.797 --> 1:01:41.631
I think...

1:01:42.198 --> 1:01:43.666
it was Shin Hae-seong.

1:01:44.033 --> 1:01:44.967
-Shin Hae-seong?
-Why?

1:01:45.802 --> 1:01:47.003
How do you know

1:01:49.138 --> 1:01:50.673
that it was Shin Hae-seong?

1:02:11.260 --> 1:02:13.229
Is this her way of apologizing
to everyone?

1:02:13.296 --> 1:02:14.397
-Maybe.
-Maybe.

1:02:20.103 --> 1:02:23.806
Instead of reflecting upon her misconduct,

1:02:24.140 --> 1:02:27.343
your daughter assaulted a classmate
during her suspension.

1:02:28.511 --> 1:02:30.546
It was an accident.

1:02:30.780 --> 1:02:33.015
The girl who got hit said so herself.

1:02:33.416 --> 1:02:34.450
Be quiet.

1:02:37.820 --> 1:02:39.122
As things stand,

1:02:39.388 --> 1:02:42.325
Hae-seong has no chance
of becoming a singer

1:02:42.391 --> 1:02:43.860
or going to an arts college.

1:02:44.427 --> 1:02:47.764
She also caused a fiasco
during the recent evaluation performance.

1:02:48.364 --> 1:02:51.534
Her academics are strong...

1:02:53.302 --> 1:02:56.005
That doesn't matter much here at Kirin.

1:02:56.272 --> 1:02:59.742
It's better to do well than poorly, but...

1:03:00.610 --> 1:03:04.547
Why are you only focusing on the negative?

1:03:05.715 --> 1:03:06.549
Pardon?

1:03:07.183 --> 1:03:08.451
If I were a teacher,

1:03:09.485 --> 1:03:13.389
it would pain me that one of my students
had an uncertain future.

1:03:14.390 --> 1:03:16.459
I thought the teachers here
really cared for their students.

1:03:16.592 --> 1:03:19.362
That's why I entrusted
my daughter to your care.

1:03:19.428 --> 1:03:21.831
-Dad.
-I told you to zip it.

1:03:25.902 --> 1:03:27.103
I'm having her transferred.

1:03:28.771 --> 1:03:29.605
Pardon?

1:03:29.939 --> 1:03:31.073
Dad.

1:03:31.774 --> 1:03:35.611
I can't have her stay
at a school like this.

1:03:38.915 --> 1:03:40.783
-Let's go.
-Dad.

1:03:42.151 --> 1:03:42.985
Wait...

1:03:43.252 --> 1:03:44.854
-Dad.
-Mr. Shin.

1:03:49.358 --> 1:03:52.929
I'm not transferring. No way.

1:03:54.230 --> 1:03:55.298
No ifs or buts.

1:03:55.798 --> 1:03:58.501
I'm coming tomorrow to do the paperwork.
Pack up your things.

1:03:58.568 --> 1:04:01.370
I'm already having a hard time.
Don't make things harder.

1:04:01.437 --> 1:04:03.039
That's why you need to get out of here.

1:04:03.940 --> 1:04:06.676
After you get into a regular college,
you can do whatever you like.

1:04:07.410 --> 1:04:08.711
That's final.

1:04:09.612 --> 1:04:11.647
What an accursed school...

1:05:48.911 --> 1:05:49.979
The apple is delicious.

1:05:52.915 --> 1:05:53.950
If you're throwing them out,

1:05:54.650 --> 1:05:55.885
could I have them?

1:05:56.719 --> 1:05:58.120
You see, I really love apples.

1:06:10.866 --> 1:06:11.701
I'm...

1:06:13.736 --> 1:06:14.937
going to run away.

1:06:15.972 --> 1:06:19.008
What's wrong with running away?

1:06:20.009 --> 1:06:21.944
I'm going to run away.

1:06:34.056 --> 1:06:36.692
Most girls look pretty when they cry,

1:06:39.362 --> 1:06:40.730
but crying doesn't suit you.

1:06:42.264 --> 1:06:43.099
Stop crying.

1:06:43.866 --> 1:06:44.700
Stop it.
