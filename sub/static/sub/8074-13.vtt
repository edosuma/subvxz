[music playing]

00:10.078 --> 00:10.944
[door slams]

00:12.513 --> 00:14.648
Hey, honey, what's going on?

00:14.682 --> 00:16.684
Uh, well, me and
my unborn daughter

00:16.717 --> 00:20.388
were just going in here
to have little puke party.

00:20.421 --> 00:21.955
What are you doing in here?

00:21.989 --> 00:23.491
Doing?

00:23.524 --> 00:25.626
Oh, I thought I
heard something--

00:25.659 --> 00:30.498
probably a squirrel or a
bird, but he ran away or flew,

00:30.531 --> 00:31.332
depending on what it was.

00:34.468 --> 00:36.737
Oh, you don't want to know.

00:36.770 --> 00:38.672
Come on, Dan.

00:38.706 --> 00:40.007
The only thing I
don't want to know

00:40.040 --> 00:44.178
is what is in that green
bag in the freezer.

00:44.212 --> 00:47.715
Well, today, after I dropped
off Darlene at the library,

00:47.748 --> 00:50.318
I ran into Ed Jorgenson.

00:50.351 --> 00:54.722
You know he sells firewood
in the winter now?

00:54.755 --> 00:57.791
Anyhow, I hadn't
seen anything yet,

00:57.825 --> 00:59.427
but he told me that our
new neighbors-- they kind

00:59.460 --> 01:01.061
of like to run around naked.

01:01.095 --> 01:02.996
And I just wanted to see
if it was true, you know,

01:03.030 --> 01:05.533
so I could warn you.

01:05.566 --> 01:07.335
Good god, what's
the matter with you--

01:07.368 --> 01:11.572
thinking I don't want to
see the neighbors naked.

01:11.605 --> 01:13.107
I thought you'd
think I was perverted.

01:13.141 --> 01:14.308
No.

01:14.342 --> 01:16.144
You watching alone is
perverted, but us watching

01:16.177 --> 01:18.346
together-- now that's a date.

01:18.379 --> 01:20.514
Besides, this guy I saw the
other day carrying boxes

01:20.548 --> 01:22.550
in over there, he's the
kind of guy you normally

01:22.583 --> 01:24.218
have to pay to see naked.

01:26.954 --> 01:30.891
Oh god, I guess that might
have been their grandson.

01:33.994 --> 01:37.165
Or their great,
great, great, grandson--

01:37.198 --> 01:40.134
oh, me.

01:40.168 --> 01:42.470
I hope mine don't look like
that when I get that old.

01:45.105 --> 01:47.641
Yeah, I hope not too, Dan,
because that's the wife.

01:52.246 --> 01:58.219
Oh my god, I cannot sit here
and look at this any more.

01:58.252 --> 01:59.052
Me neither--

02:04.625 --> 02:06.494
[music playing]

03:01.782 --> 03:03.083
What are you doing?

03:03.116 --> 03:04.051
DAN: There's a commercial on.

03:04.084 --> 03:05.686
I'm getting a beer.

03:05.719 --> 03:09.490
News flash, Dan, we don't
have a TV in our bedroom.

03:09.523 --> 03:12.493
No, but the neighbors
got one in theirs.

03:12.526 --> 03:14.562
By the time they left the
room, I realized I hadn't had

03:14.595 --> 03:17.231
anything to drink in six hours.

03:17.265 --> 03:18.966
I can't believe you're
still sitting there

03:18.999 --> 03:21.902
watching the Illinois raisins.

03:21.935 --> 03:24.572
I can't stop looking.

03:24.605 --> 03:25.473
It's like a train wreck.

03:28.376 --> 03:30.143
A train wreck full
of naked people.

03:33.447 --> 03:35.449
MARK: Stupid keys.

03:35.483 --> 03:37.150
Open up you stupid door.

03:37.184 --> 03:38.486
Come on!

03:38.519 --> 03:39.387
[pounding on door]

03:39.420 --> 03:41.889
Hey-- hey.

03:41.922 --> 03:44.091
Oh, hey--

03:44.124 --> 03:45.259
What's the matter, Mark?

03:45.293 --> 03:46.827
Did the guys at the garage
convince you that it

03:46.860 --> 03:49.730
was New Year's Eve again?

03:49.763 --> 03:52.533
I'm not drunk, Roseanne.

03:52.566 --> 03:55.202
Hey, you know, that's the first
time I've ever called you that.

03:55.235 --> 04:01.241
Roseanne, Rosie,
Roadie, row, row, row--

04:01.275 --> 04:02.276
You'd better get in here.

04:02.310 --> 04:03.777
You're in no condition
to be out there.

04:03.811 --> 04:06.213
You'd better get in here and
start cleaning Dan's guns.

04:10.651 --> 04:13.454
You know, maybe I
could use some coffee.

04:13.487 --> 04:15.323
Yeah, well, if you
really want to sober up,

04:15.356 --> 04:17.891
you should see what drinking
did to our new neighbors.

04:21.228 --> 04:24.798
So you want to tell
me why you're drunk?

04:24.832 --> 04:26.467
I don't know to
tell you anything

04:26.500 --> 04:29.437
because you're not my friend.

04:29.470 --> 04:31.505
All my real friends
are down at the bar,

04:31.539 --> 04:35.309
like that new fat guy and um--

04:35.343 --> 04:36.243
the new guy with the hat.

04:40.147 --> 04:42.683
So was Becky worried
about me or--

04:42.716 --> 04:43.584
Um, no.

04:43.617 --> 04:46.286
She's still out with David.

04:46.320 --> 04:47.521
Darlene go with them?

04:47.555 --> 04:48.422
No.

04:48.456 --> 04:50.458
They went alone.

04:50.491 --> 04:54.695
Great, it's like the
eighth night this week.

04:54.728 --> 04:56.730
Sorry, Mark.

04:56.764 --> 04:58.366
I don't care
what those two do.

04:58.399 --> 04:59.900
I don't give a damn about them.

04:59.933 --> 05:01.635
Well, you better start
caring, because if we

05:01.669 --> 05:03.070
start trading
spouses around here,

05:03.103 --> 05:04.304
you just might end up with me.

05:04.338 --> 05:06.006
Would you like that?

05:06.039 --> 05:07.441
No.

05:07.475 --> 05:09.076
I can't do anything about it

05:09.109 --> 05:10.077
Yeah, you can.

05:10.110 --> 05:12.746
Just tell her that
you don't like it.

05:12.780 --> 05:15.683
I'm afraid if I yell at her,
she's just going to hate me.

05:15.716 --> 05:17.618
She's not going
to hate you, Mark.

05:17.651 --> 05:21.755
She loves you in a way that
makes our entire family think

05:21.789 --> 05:22.590
less of her.

05:25.893 --> 05:28.862
Look, I'll handle this
my own way, but thanks

05:28.896 --> 05:31.164
for trying to help me.

05:31.198 --> 05:33.601
Hey, you know something?

05:33.634 --> 05:36.737
You're all right.

05:36.770 --> 05:38.038
Well, gee-- thanks, Mark.

05:38.071 --> 05:40.140
You know, I didn't get much
approval from my parents,

05:40.173 --> 05:45.379
but hearing it from my drunk
son-in-law is just as good.

05:45.413 --> 05:46.279
[music playing]

05:49.282 --> 05:52.319
Hey, come on-- big old
greasy bucket of chicken.

05:52.352 --> 05:56.356
Last one in lives
to a ripe old age.

05:56.390 --> 05:58.492
Get the stuff away from me.

05:58.526 --> 06:00.594
Just thinking about those
people next door has given

06:00.628 --> 06:02.095
the term, chicken skin,
a whole new meaning.

06:05.399 --> 06:06.467
What they doing now?

06:09.169 --> 06:12.406
Playing air hockey.

06:12.440 --> 06:17.244
Oh, god, as if hockey
wasn't an ugly enough sport.

06:17.277 --> 06:18.679
Hello.

06:18.712 --> 06:20.180
Hey, you guys,
brought the beer.

06:20.213 --> 06:22.916
Well, before we eat I'm
going to run to the bathroom.

06:22.950 --> 06:24.985
I've got to wash my hands and
burn on my corneas with Drano.

06:28.589 --> 06:30.458
What's the matter with him?

06:30.491 --> 06:32.926
Oh, he's just really,
really into, uh,

06:32.960 --> 06:34.194
watching our new neighbors.

06:34.227 --> 06:35.763
They have a new Buick.

06:35.796 --> 06:39.533
Oh, yeah, and they walk
around naked all the time.

06:39.567 --> 06:40.901
I can't believe that
Dan would do that.

06:40.934 --> 06:42.736
What?
It's no big deal.

06:42.770 --> 06:43.604
You approve?

06:43.637 --> 06:45.138
You're not looking too, are you?

06:45.172 --> 06:46.774
Well, yeah-- not
as much as Dan.

06:46.807 --> 06:49.710
I'm not sick.

06:49.743 --> 06:52.045
Do your new neighbors know
that you're watching them?

06:52.079 --> 06:53.246
No.

06:53.280 --> 06:54.982
We stand completely still
because if they see us,

06:55.015 --> 06:57.284
you know, they might
change their behavior.

06:57.317 --> 07:00.120
We got that from Wild Kingdom.

07:00.153 --> 07:03.323
Good god, Roseanne--
you want a cheap thrill?

07:03.356 --> 07:04.692
Go rent a porno movie.

07:04.725 --> 07:06.794
At least those people
want to be watched.

07:06.827 --> 07:12.766
Yeah, but they ain't,
like, 112 years old.

07:12.800 --> 07:14.167
That's no excuse.

07:14.201 --> 07:18.939
If anything, it makes it more
wrong, more sad, and more sick.

07:18.972 --> 07:20.073
They're really old?

07:20.107 --> 07:21.942
Oh, yeah.

07:21.975 --> 07:23.777
I'm sure they'll never
forget where they

07:23.811 --> 07:27.981
were the day Lincoln was shot.

07:28.015 --> 07:31.284
They're completely
naked all the time?

07:31.318 --> 07:32.820
Sometimes he wears a hat.

07:36.657 --> 07:39.359
- I've got to look.
- Jacky--

07:39.392 --> 07:40.761
Don't do it, Jacky.

07:40.794 --> 07:42.663
The Cornellys can be quite
a monkey on your back.

07:42.696 --> 07:45.699
Out of my way, Dan.

07:45.733 --> 07:47.535
They've got to be stopped.

07:47.568 --> 07:48.969
It's not the
neighbor's problem, Dan.

07:49.002 --> 07:50.170
They got a right
to do whatever they

07:50.203 --> 07:51.605
want to do in their own house.

07:51.639 --> 07:52.940
That's right, Dan.

07:52.973 --> 07:55.308
Our forefathers died
so the Cornellys

07:55.342 --> 07:58.045
could play naked air hockey.

07:58.078 --> 08:00.981
But you don't have
a right to watch them.

08:01.014 --> 08:02.583
Watching's wrong.

08:02.616 --> 08:03.851
Wrong, Fred?

08:03.884 --> 08:07.220
Wrong is when bad things
happen to good people.

08:07.254 --> 08:09.156
And you want to know why bad
things happen to good people?

08:09.189 --> 08:13.661
Because God is too busy
watching it Cornellys.

08:13.694 --> 08:15.195
Fine-- if you say
there's nothing wrong with

08:15.228 --> 08:17.164
it then let's just forget it.

08:17.197 --> 08:19.332
Hey, mom, I know what
I want for my birthday.

08:19.366 --> 08:22.402
Good-- well, keep it a
secret, so I'll be surprised.

08:22.435 --> 08:25.405
I want an air hockey game.

08:25.438 --> 08:27.741
[music playing]

08:33.614 --> 08:36.316
Hey--

08:36.349 --> 08:37.217
What do you want?

08:37.250 --> 08:38.719
You never come down here.

08:38.752 --> 08:41.154
Yeah, well, this
time I wanted to.

08:41.188 --> 08:44.291
No, Mark, that wasn't an
observation, that was an order.

08:44.324 --> 08:48.161
You, never come down here.

08:48.195 --> 08:52.399
Well, I just wanted to
ask you about something.

08:52.432 --> 08:57.104
So, uh, how are you and David
getting along these days?

08:57.137 --> 08:59.472
Great-- we find
that nothing enhances

08:59.506 --> 09:04.044
romance like breaking up and
sleeping with other people.

09:04.077 --> 09:05.579
Yeah, you know,
I don't think he

09:05.613 --> 09:09.917
was real serious about that
Dina girl he was seeing.

09:09.950 --> 09:12.319
You'll probably get him back.

09:12.352 --> 09:13.887
Oh, do you think so?

09:13.921 --> 09:15.422
Every night I kneel
at the foot of my bed.

09:15.455 --> 09:17.658
And I pray that we'll
get back together.

09:17.691 --> 09:19.927
Then I make my new boyfriend
get out of bed and pray with me.

09:23.430 --> 09:26.433
I just think you guys are
really good for each other.

09:26.466 --> 09:27.534
Mark, stop it.

09:27.567 --> 09:28.769
David made you come
down here, didn't he?

09:28.802 --> 09:29.703
No.

09:29.737 --> 09:30.871
He doesn't even
know I came down.

09:30.904 --> 09:32.239
Just get out.

09:32.272 --> 09:33.607
Look, I don't care what the
hell happens between you two.

09:33.641 --> 09:37.577
I just want David to
stay away from my wife.

09:37.611 --> 09:38.979
Wake up, Mark.

09:39.012 --> 09:40.714
I mean, David's just
trying to make me jealous.

09:40.748 --> 09:44.718
He doesn't want Becky any
more than my parents did.

09:44.752 --> 09:45.619
No.

09:45.653 --> 09:46.820
This isn't just for you.

09:46.854 --> 09:49.823
This has been going on
way before you came home.

09:49.857 --> 09:51.058
What?

09:51.091 --> 09:53.827
Yeah, they've been spending
tons of time together.

09:53.861 --> 09:56.897
I mean, Becky hardly
even talk to me anymore.

09:56.930 --> 09:59.132
I don't believe it.

09:59.166 --> 10:01.635
She thinks David's
Mr. Sensitive.

10:01.669 --> 10:02.535
So what am I--

10:02.569 --> 10:05.138
Mr. Opposite of that?

10:08.141 --> 10:09.342
Get out of my way.

10:16.884 --> 10:18.686
What are you doing getting
involved with David, Becky?

10:18.719 --> 10:20.587
You're a married woman.

10:20.620 --> 10:22.522
Since when did you
care about my marriage?

10:22.555 --> 10:26.459
Since you decided to
trade Mo in for Curly.

10:26.493 --> 10:27.861
You're just jealous.

10:27.895 --> 10:28.962
Oh, no.

10:28.996 --> 10:31.665
I'm not jealous.

10:31.699 --> 10:34.501
Hey, mind if I watch TV?

10:34.534 --> 10:36.436
Are you doing this because
of some sick competition

10:36.469 --> 10:37.404
thing between you and me?

10:37.437 --> 10:38.638
I mean, is that
what this is about?

10:38.672 --> 10:39.707
That is ridiculous.

10:39.740 --> 10:41.041
David and I hang out
together because we

10:41.074 --> 10:42.810
like talking to each other.

10:42.843 --> 10:44.477
Yeah, I'm sure you find
it a lot easier to talk

10:44.511 --> 10:45.478
with your skirt over your head.

10:48.515 --> 10:51.384
You know, I think
I watch too much TV.

10:51.418 --> 10:53.253
Hold it-- what are
you doing with her?

10:53.286 --> 10:54.722
You know-- I mean, not
that I'm necessarily

10:54.755 --> 10:58.792
against necrophilia, but
I think it's illegal.

10:58.826 --> 11:00.894
There's nothing
going on between us.

11:00.928 --> 11:03.396
She's my brother's wife
for crying out loud.

11:03.430 --> 11:04.765
The man stuck a
fork in my hand when

11:04.798 --> 11:05.699
I tried to take his dessert.

11:08.702 --> 11:10.971
Well, if it's not a sex
thing, then what is it?

11:11.004 --> 11:12.605
I mean, I ran out of
things to talk to her about

11:12.639 --> 11:16.043
when I was, like, two.
- Ignore her, David.

11:16.076 --> 11:17.945
She's just jealous because we
have a relationship where we

11:17.978 --> 11:19.646
like and respect each other--

11:19.679 --> 11:21.514
not like the one
you had with David.

11:21.548 --> 11:23.150
What's that supposed to mean?

11:23.183 --> 11:25.352
I was closer to David
than you could ever be.

11:25.385 --> 11:27.220
Yeah-- OK, Darlene.

11:27.254 --> 11:28.588
Oh, don't give me that.

11:28.621 --> 11:31.124
I mean, what could the two of
you possibly have in common?

11:31.158 --> 11:33.393
Well, we both live
with you and you

11:33.426 --> 11:35.996
treated us both like crap.

11:36.029 --> 11:37.564
I did not.

11:37.597 --> 11:39.900
I mean, maybe I treated
you like crap, but--

11:39.933 --> 11:43.403
well, have you ever
spent any time with you?

11:43.436 --> 11:44.571
Oh, that's right.

11:44.604 --> 11:46.940
You treated David
with lots of respect.

11:46.974 --> 11:48.508
I did.

11:48.541 --> 11:50.443
Tell her-- you may speak.

11:53.781 --> 11:56.116
Come on, David,
now's your chance.

11:56.149 --> 11:59.086
You said you weren't going to
take any more of her abuse.

11:59.119 --> 12:00.120
Abuse?

12:00.153 --> 12:03.690
David, what have you
been telling her?

12:03.723 --> 12:05.893
I can see I'm just
in the way here.

12:05.926 --> 12:06.794
Come on, David.

12:06.827 --> 12:08.428
Tell her how horrible it was.

12:08.461 --> 12:10.330
Stand up for yourself.

12:10.363 --> 12:12.432
You don't agree
with her, do you?

12:12.465 --> 12:13.333
David--

12:13.366 --> 12:14.802
Shut up-- do you?

12:14.835 --> 12:16.703
Darlene--

12:16.736 --> 12:19.639
Well, come on-- tell
her she's wrong, David.

12:19.672 --> 12:22.475
I can't.

12:22.509 --> 12:24.111
What?

12:24.144 --> 12:25.245
I'm sorry.

12:25.278 --> 12:29.449
At the time I thought
it was great, but now--

12:29.482 --> 12:30.450
--but now, what?

12:33.686 --> 12:36.156
I just don't think we
ever really connected.

12:39.993 --> 12:41.161
God, David--

12:41.194 --> 12:44.297
I mean, I was closer to
you than anybody I've ever

12:44.331 --> 12:47.234
been with in my whole life.

12:47.267 --> 12:48.568
I'm sorry.

12:48.601 --> 12:50.003
Face it, Darlene.

12:50.037 --> 12:53.406
You just can't get
close to anybody.

12:53.440 --> 12:56.910
Oh, go to hell, both of you.

12:56.944 --> 12:59.279
[music playing]

13:06.719 --> 13:08.755
Oh, you're serving the
neighbors sliced Twinkies.

13:08.788 --> 13:10.757
You don't think it's
too pretentious, do you?

13:10.790 --> 13:11.791
You know what?

13:11.825 --> 13:14.027
I don't think this
is such a good idea.

13:14.061 --> 13:15.829
We should have just sent
them an anonymous note.

13:15.863 --> 13:17.230
Oh yeah, right--

13:17.264 --> 13:18.966
we're sorry, but our
bedroom looks right

13:18.999 --> 13:21.268
into yours, signed anonymous.

13:21.301 --> 13:22.903
[doorbell]

13:22.936 --> 13:25.705
Geez Roseanne, I was
taught to respect my elders.

13:25.738 --> 13:27.307
I don't think I can do this.

13:27.340 --> 13:28.876
Oh, it's no big deal, Dan.

13:28.909 --> 13:32.980
If you get nervous, just
try picturing them naked.

13:33.013 --> 13:36.884
Hi, we're the Cornellys.

13:36.917 --> 13:38.886
Hi, I'm Dan Conner.

13:38.919 --> 13:40.553
This is my wife, Roseanne.

13:40.587 --> 13:41.989
Nice to meet you.

13:42.022 --> 13:42.890
I'm skip.

13:42.923 --> 13:45.225
And this is Irene.

13:45.258 --> 13:46.759
Here, I baked you
a little something.

13:46.793 --> 13:48.095
Thank you.

13:48.128 --> 13:53.700
Gee I-- I hate to think of
you standing over a hot stove.

13:53.733 --> 13:56.603
Come on in-- sit down.

13:56.636 --> 13:59.873
Boy, we were so glad when
you moved in because, you know,

13:59.907 --> 14:03.710
nowadays when new people move in
you get so nervous, what with--

14:03.743 --> 14:06.746
oh, all the drug problems
and things like that.

14:06.779 --> 14:08.215
You know, it seems like
everywhere you look,

14:08.248 --> 14:10.117
nowadays, all you see is crack.

14:17.390 --> 14:19.792
This might be a good time
to bring up something.

14:19.826 --> 14:22.029
What a beautiful family.

14:22.062 --> 14:25.432
Skip, Roseanne was talking.

14:25.465 --> 14:27.667
He loves young people.

14:27.700 --> 14:31.271
He taught high
school for 40 years.

14:31.304 --> 14:34.107
And Irene was
our school nurse,

14:34.141 --> 14:36.843
except for those three years
when she looked after our boys

14:36.876 --> 14:37.677
in Korea.

14:43.850 --> 14:45.585
Oh, but I'm sorry.

14:45.618 --> 14:47.687
You are going to say something.

14:47.720 --> 14:49.889
Mmm--- I was
wondering what you guys

14:49.923 --> 14:54.061
do all day besides hang out.

14:54.094 --> 14:56.029
Oh, come on, Roseanne, I
thought you had something

14:56.063 --> 14:56.896
else you wanted to ask them.

15:02.302 --> 15:05.038
Yeah, I was wondering
where are you guys from?

15:05.072 --> 15:08.775
Yeah, I'm guessing it's
someplace really warm.

15:08.808 --> 15:10.443
We're from Elgin.

15:10.477 --> 15:13.013
You really have a lovely home.

15:13.046 --> 15:17.117
Well, thank you very much.

15:17.150 --> 15:19.852
I could give you a tour.

15:19.886 --> 15:23.223
Yeah, um-- this is the
kitchen, you know--

15:23.256 --> 15:24.124
no big deal.

15:24.157 --> 15:26.093
Just a kitchen and the hallway.

15:26.126 --> 15:27.527
We should go in
the bedroom there

15:27.560 --> 15:31.398
because at night you get a
really good view of the stars

15:31.431 --> 15:32.632
there.

15:32.665 --> 15:35.235
Usually around now, we have
a lovely view of Uranus.

15:39.106 --> 15:41.774
And hey, there's our window.

15:41.808 --> 15:45.212
You know what, Skip and Irene?

15:45.245 --> 15:47.780
I'll bet you could see
right into our bedroom

15:47.814 --> 15:49.382
from over there.

15:49.416 --> 15:54.887
Oh, no-- we're
terribly nearsighted.

15:54.921 --> 15:57.490
Oh, well, Dan's
got perfect eyesight.

15:57.524 --> 15:59.026
He don't even need
those binoculars

15:59.059 --> 15:59.826
he's got sitting there.

16:05.432 --> 16:08.368
You know what your
house could use?

16:08.401 --> 16:11.104
A hedge-- not every
house can hold a hedge,

16:11.138 --> 16:12.539
but yours sure could no.

16:12.572 --> 16:13.440
No.

16:13.473 --> 16:15.508
We like an open yard.

16:15.542 --> 16:18.378
It's more neighborly.

16:18.411 --> 16:20.847
Uh-- hold it.

16:20.880 --> 16:25.352
See-- see, the thing
of it is, um, Dan--

16:25.385 --> 16:26.886
I don't know what the
thing of it is, honey.

16:26.919 --> 16:28.855
You sure as hell seemed to have
a handle on the thing of it

16:28.888 --> 16:31.224
earlier.

16:31.258 --> 16:32.125
OK.

16:32.159 --> 16:33.093
Well, I don't--

16:33.126 --> 16:35.428
I don't exactly know
how to say this.

16:35.462 --> 16:36.329
We can see you naked.

16:39.166 --> 16:41.768
That is what-- one time we
were looking out the window.

16:41.801 --> 16:45.305
And we happened to notice that,
through no fault of your own,

16:45.338 --> 16:46.973
you weren't wearing any clothes.

16:47.006 --> 16:48.007
That's all right.

16:48.041 --> 16:51.211
We rarely wear clothes
around the house.

16:51.244 --> 16:52.912
That's right, dear.

16:52.945 --> 16:56.583
We believe the human body,
in its natural state,

16:56.616 --> 16:57.484
is beautiful.

17:04.023 --> 17:05.825
God, are they nearsighted.

17:10.597 --> 17:12.565
Uh, look, it's
not that we think

17:12.599 --> 17:14.467
anything is wrong with nudity.

17:14.501 --> 17:17.337
As a matter of fact,
me and Mr. Conner

17:17.370 --> 17:18.505
used to have sex that way.

17:21.674 --> 17:25.412
Well, we figure if people
don't want to see us,

17:25.445 --> 17:26.979
they just won't look.

17:27.013 --> 17:28.115
You don't understand.

17:28.148 --> 17:40.527
It's not that we want to
look, we can't help it.

17:40.560 --> 17:41.828
You can't help it?

17:44.664 --> 17:46.833
Well, we don't want to
offend you or anything.

17:46.866 --> 17:48.435
It's just that we think
that the sight of you

17:48.468 --> 17:50.903
might be wrecking our son.

17:50.937 --> 17:51.838
Oh, really?

17:51.871 --> 17:53.673
And how's that?

17:53.706 --> 17:57.244
Well, no offense, you know--

17:57.277 --> 18:01.948
uh, but look at you.

18:01.981 --> 18:04.617
Well, no offense,
but look at you.

18:04.651 --> 18:05.918
And you have clothes on.

18:08.721 --> 18:10.190
It isn't our nudity.

18:10.223 --> 18:12.659
It's our age, isn't it?

18:12.692 --> 18:17.364
Perhaps, if we were
younger and more attractive

18:17.397 --> 18:19.632
we wouldn't be having that talk.

18:19.666 --> 18:23.603
Well, yeah, probably not
for a couple more weeks.

18:23.636 --> 18:26.206
I feel sorry for you people.

18:26.239 --> 18:32.412
Nudity is our chosen lifestyle,
but you can't help yourselves.

18:32.445 --> 18:35.482
You're compulsive,
sick, perverts.

18:38.351 --> 18:42.222
Well, it's not that
easy not to look.

18:42.255 --> 18:45.124
Well, I certainly
think we could manage.

18:45.158 --> 18:47.160
Oh, yeah-- what
color are my eyes?

18:47.194 --> 18:48.628
Oh my god!

18:48.661 --> 18:49.529
Run, dear.

18:53.533 --> 18:56.936
We're going to plant
that hedge-- believe me.

18:56.969 --> 18:59.038
And we'll tell
all your neighbors

18:59.071 --> 19:02.141
just what kind people you are.

19:02.175 --> 19:03.510
Well, it's too late.

19:03.543 --> 19:04.811
They already know.

19:12.118 --> 19:15.788
You know, honey, we really
must entertain more often.

19:15.822 --> 19:17.957
That was fun.

19:17.990 --> 19:20.293
[music playing]

19:25.198 --> 19:26.633
Hey, Mark,
where's mom and dad?

19:26.666 --> 19:28.201
I got to get to the bus station.

19:28.235 --> 19:29.669
Are you leaving?

19:29.702 --> 19:30.803
No.

19:30.837 --> 19:32.272
I just got to get down
there and meet my pimp.

19:32.305 --> 19:35.675
If I don't get going
he'll smack me around.

19:35.708 --> 19:38.345
Your parents are gone.

19:38.378 --> 19:39.879
Great-- I'm walking.

19:39.912 --> 19:41.614
I've got to get out of here.

19:41.648 --> 19:43.583
Well, you got a suitcase?

19:43.616 --> 19:44.517
No, Mark.

19:44.551 --> 19:46.453
I wear the same
outfit every day.

19:46.486 --> 19:49.088
Then when it gets dirty, I jump
into the river fully clothed

19:49.121 --> 19:52.191
and beat myself against a rock.

19:52.225 --> 19:53.560
Look, it's a
five minute drive.

19:53.593 --> 19:54.927
I can take you down there.

19:54.961 --> 19:56.529
That would be
great, but you've

19:56.563 --> 19:59.198
got to turn twice to get there.

19:59.232 --> 20:01.834
How would you find
your way back?

20:01.868 --> 20:03.202
Just forget I
offered, all right.

20:03.236 --> 20:04.304
I've had enough of your crap.

20:08.007 --> 20:09.642
I'm sorry, Mark.

20:09.676 --> 20:11.278
Well, look, it hasn't
been the best week for me

20:11.311 --> 20:12.645
either, all right.

20:12.679 --> 20:14.281
I really am sorry.

20:14.314 --> 20:15.114
Just get your stuff.

20:18.585 --> 20:21.954
You're bummed out about
this whole Becky thing, right?

20:21.988 --> 20:24.291
I mean, there's still a chance
you guys can work it out.

20:24.324 --> 20:26.926
Yeah, right-- like
you really care.

20:26.959 --> 20:28.461
I'm trying to be
nice here, Mark.

20:28.495 --> 20:31.431
You know, it would really be
helpful if you didn't speak.

20:31.464 --> 20:33.833
Like you're trying
to be nice to me?

20:33.866 --> 20:36.135
Man, I must seem
really pathetic.

20:36.168 --> 20:37.537
No.

20:37.570 --> 20:40.273
I just think that there's got to
be some hope for your marriage

20:40.307 --> 20:42.609
if it means this much to you.

20:42.642 --> 20:46.112
I mean, you cared enough to come
down to my room and talk to me.

20:46.145 --> 20:48.114
Apparently that isn't the
easiest thing for anybody

20:48.147 --> 20:49.582
to do.

20:49.616 --> 20:53.019
Yeah, that really
didn't know help.

20:53.052 --> 20:54.621
Well, maybe that's
because you opened up to me

20:54.654 --> 20:56.323
and not to Becky.

20:56.356 --> 20:58.758
So you think if I make
myself more open to talk to,

20:58.791 --> 21:00.159
Becky will come to
me instead of David?

21:00.192 --> 21:00.993
Yeah.

21:04.096 --> 21:07.334
How do I do that?

21:07.367 --> 21:08.335
Hell if I know.

21:11.538 --> 21:13.340
Hey, Darlene--

21:13.373 --> 21:15.241
Yeah--

21:15.274 --> 21:16.543
You know-- thanks.

21:20.279 --> 21:24.984
You know, you're really
not that bad a guy, Mark.

21:25.017 --> 21:27.720
Well, wait a minute.

21:27.754 --> 21:31.424
Are you trying to get back
at Becky by coming on to me?

21:31.458 --> 21:32.725
What?

21:32.759 --> 21:34.594
Look, just so
you know, no way am
