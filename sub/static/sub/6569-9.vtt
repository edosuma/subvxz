00:17.941 --> 00:19.275
<i>Thank you so much.</i>

00:19.368 --> 00:22.236
Victory in Iowa is just
the start of the job.

00:22.321 --> 00:25.073
<i>- I've worked my whole life...
- Oh, please.</i>

00:25.075 --> 00:26.958
<i>and now it's time to
make this country work.</i>

00:26.992 --> 00:29.377
Let's take our shirts
off and work up a sweat.

00:29.411 --> 00:32.080
Listen to this idiot. They're not
even sound bites. They're just sounds.

00:32.131 --> 00:33.798
Yeah, but it works,
though. That's the thing.

00:33.832 --> 00:35.333
I mean, he cornholed us in Iowa.

00:35.384 --> 00:37.418
Well, that's appropriate.
It's the corn state.

00:37.420 --> 00:39.003
What are Thornhill's numbers now?

00:39.054 --> 00:40.805
And please downplay them so I don't cry.

00:40.839 --> 00:43.841
- He's killing us.
- Please downplay them, I said.

00:43.892 --> 00:45.393
She is downplaying them, ma'am.

00:45.427 --> 00:47.261
<i>People like someone
who's normal, okay?</i>

00:47.312 --> 00:50.648
Gritty... you know, folks
who actually eat grits.

00:50.683 --> 00:52.850
I'm normal. I can be so folksy.

00:52.901 --> 00:55.687
Doing the folksy thing with... folks.

00:57.406 --> 00:58.773
Hello?

00:58.775 --> 01:00.108
We'll push it. We'll push it more.

01:00.110 --> 01:01.659
Well, push it. We got four days left.

01:01.694 --> 01:03.578
Remember when we only had five days left?

01:03.612 --> 01:05.163
- Those were good times.
- Great times.

01:05.197 --> 01:07.198
- We're gonna get you out in the streets.
- Okay.

01:07.282 --> 01:08.783
You know, shopping malls,
community centers...

01:08.834 --> 01:10.368
<i>- Right. Right.
- ...farmers' markets.</i>

01:10.419 --> 01:13.121
You should go to a ball game,
ma'am. Throw out the first pitch.

01:13.172 --> 01:14.789
It's January, Mike.

01:14.840 --> 01:17.208
<i>Yeah, and I
can't throw a ball, Mike.</i>

01:17.259 --> 01:18.876
I'll look like Gary here.

01:18.927 --> 01:20.461
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

01:20.512 --> 01:22.847
Um, what about local phone-in shows?

01:22.881 --> 01:24.298
Great idea. Talk some real vote meat.

01:24.349 --> 01:26.300
Rub with a schlub. That kind of thing.

01:26.351 --> 01:29.804
Guys, guys, you gotta get
out there on the stump.

01:29.806 --> 01:31.472
That's a good point. Nothing
says "regular American"

01:31.523 --> 01:34.025
like standing on a street
corner shouting at strangers.

01:34.059 --> 01:37.311
- Okay.
- Actually, I had a similar thought.

01:37.362 --> 01:39.947
Ladies and gentlemen,
your attention, please.

01:39.982 --> 01:41.733
What, are you David Coppercock?

01:41.784 --> 01:44.869
If you like, Humor Man, yes.

01:44.903 --> 01:46.954
- Uh, can I get a volunteer?
- Me, me, me.

01:46.989 --> 01:49.123
<i>- Me, me, me.
- You. Come forward.</i>

01:49.158 --> 01:51.409
Gary, please open the box.

01:51.460 --> 01:53.711
Ooh. Oh.

01:53.746 --> 01:55.830
- What is it?
- Take it out.

01:55.832 --> 01:57.632
Oh. Oh, my God.

01:57.666 --> 01:59.717
Wow, it's a box inside of a box.

01:59.752 --> 02:02.003
Jesus!

02:02.054 --> 02:04.472
Oh, it's a crate.

02:04.506 --> 02:05.807
- Wow!
- You like that?

02:05.841 --> 02:07.508
I love it. Are you okay?

02:07.510 --> 02:09.143
- That really hurt my...
- Can you move?

02:09.178 --> 02:10.812
- Yeah.
- Yeah, get up there.

02:10.846 --> 02:12.930
- Take it for a test spin.
- Yes.

02:12.981 --> 02:16.067
Huh? See, it's folksy, it's traditional,

02:16.101 --> 02:18.603
and it's reinforced with titanium
so you won't fall through.

02:18.654 --> 02:21.072
It's fantastic. You guys, this could
be the key image for the campaign.

02:21.106 --> 02:23.241
- Me on a crate. I love this!
- Yep.

02:23.275 --> 02:24.909
- Ma'am, new donations...
- God.

02:24.943 --> 02:28.196
Mark Dugdale from Dugdale
Recycling just pledged $30,000.

02:28.198 --> 02:29.864
Okay, so I'll make a call in to him.

02:29.915 --> 02:31.532
I gotta tell you something.

02:31.583 --> 02:34.035
I wanna get away from the politicos.

02:34.037 --> 02:36.954
I wanna talk to you, the regular Joes.

02:37.005 --> 02:38.623
<i>- Right?
- Yeah, yeah.</i>

02:38.674 --> 02:40.708
We also have $2,000 from
a guy named Paul Duffy

02:40.710 --> 02:42.043
from the local dry cleaner.

02:42.094 --> 02:44.378
Okay, for two grand, you
don't get a call from me.

02:44.380 --> 02:46.547
Okay? Just send him a button or something.

02:46.598 --> 02:49.133
See, the thing is, folks, is
that this is the real America

02:49.184 --> 02:51.385
and I want to say God bless you guys.

02:51.436 --> 02:54.222
Oh, God. I could watch you do this all day.

02:54.224 --> 02:57.024
You know, they accuse you of
not thinking outside the box,

02:57.059 --> 02:58.559
but I do think outside the box.

02:58.610 --> 03:01.395
You know what else I do?
I stand on top of a box.

03:01.446 --> 03:03.531
Okay, you can stop now.

03:03.565 --> 03:05.616
- You might wanna save that voice.
- Yeah.

03:05.651 --> 03:08.619
Uh, good luck with the street
shouting. I gotta get back to DC.

03:08.654 --> 03:10.822
POTUS is
having a difficult time

03:10.873 --> 03:13.124
with FLOTUS and her...

03:13.158 --> 03:14.408
- Suicide attempt, yeah.
- Yes.

03:14.410 --> 03:15.710
<i>I don't blame her.</i>

03:15.744 --> 03:17.161
<i>Imagine being married to that guy.</i>

03:17.212 --> 03:19.080
I wouldn't put up with
that shit for a second.

03:19.082 --> 03:20.464
No.

03:20.499 --> 03:22.466
- This looks good.
- It does, right?

03:22.501 --> 03:25.837
- Do you want to...
- No, I like standing up here and looking down at everybody.

03:27.639 --> 03:32.593
Towns like this are what I
call the real towns of America,

03:32.595 --> 03:33.978
the real America.

03:34.012 --> 03:37.398
Not like the ivory towers
of Washington, folks.

03:37.432 --> 03:39.100
That's not my world at all.

03:39.102 --> 03:41.936
I want to hear what you see.

03:41.938 --> 03:44.689
And I wanna see what you feel.

03:46.609 --> 03:48.492
You know what, guys?

03:48.527 --> 03:52.163
My job is to communicate
with you, the people,

03:52.197 --> 03:54.615
because if I don't communicate, guys,

03:54.666 --> 03:56.868
I communi-can't.

03:59.789 --> 04:02.123
By the way, I gotta say
you're doing a great job.

04:02.125 --> 04:04.508
Seriously, you do me better than I do me.

04:04.543 --> 04:06.294
You do yourself a lot.

04:08.630 --> 04:10.798
Joe Thornhill sends his regards.

04:10.849 --> 04:13.851
Whoa, okay. Well, send them back.

04:13.886 --> 04:16.803
Of course, not his. Mine.

04:16.805 --> 04:18.305
What are you having?

04:18.357 --> 04:20.942
Scrambled eggs, turkey
bacon, sausage, fried egg.

04:20.976 --> 04:23.644
You're having a fried egg
with your scrambled eggs?

04:23.695 --> 04:24.729
Oh, yeah. It's the egg medley.

04:24.780 --> 04:26.147
It's delicious. You've gotta try it.

04:26.149 --> 04:28.149
It's like a chicken came in your mouth.

04:28.151 --> 04:29.700
Okay.

04:32.905 --> 04:34.572
I think eggs are my
favorite breakfast...

04:34.623 --> 04:37.208
- So, how's the Maddox camp?
- It's chaos over there.

04:37.242 --> 04:39.744
People can smell the stench of death
and they're running for the lifeboats.

04:39.795 --> 04:42.496
- Really?
- Women and tall, talented men first.

04:42.547 --> 04:44.582
Have you got any offers coming in?

04:44.633 --> 04:47.001
The Chung camp has expressed some interest.

04:47.052 --> 04:50.004
- Interest? No, they're not.
- I'm sorry?

04:50.006 --> 04:51.555
I just spoke with Chris
Ellis 15 minutes ago.

04:51.590 --> 04:54.091
There's no offer going in to you.

04:54.142 --> 04:56.344
But I'm expecting one
because my skills are very...

04:56.395 --> 04:57.645
You've got no skills.

04:57.679 --> 04:59.647
Your uncle controls a lot of votes, sure.

04:59.681 --> 05:02.767
But you? If you tried to
clap, you'd miss your hands.

05:02.818 --> 05:05.186
Well, those votes can be
very useful to someone...

05:05.188 --> 05:07.438
No, we're way ahead on the living dead.

05:07.489 --> 05:09.573
We don't need your uncle or you.

05:09.608 --> 05:11.158
Okay, well, it's not just me.

05:11.193 --> 05:12.610
I have an entourage.

05:14.780 --> 05:17.665
- You can bring senior staff?
- Absolutely.

05:17.699 --> 05:19.500
Like who?

05:20.502 --> 05:21.869
He's not gonna know.

05:21.871 --> 05:24.956
- Boom, Isabella Herrera.
- Mm-hmm.

05:25.007 --> 05:28.292
- Boom, Liz Graham.
- Okay.

05:28.343 --> 05:31.879
Ace up the sleeve...
booya... Ally Craig.

05:32.881 --> 05:34.131
Well, that's very interesting.

05:34.182 --> 05:36.684
So are we gonna stop dancing?
You gonna make me an offer?

05:36.718 --> 05:39.520
take your crazy
eggs, stick 'em up your ass.

05:39.554 --> 05:42.640
Meanwhile, I can now
confidently spread the story

05:42.691 --> 05:44.692
that the Maddox camp is
hemorrhaging like a burst dog.

05:44.726 --> 05:46.360
Have a nice day.

05:46.395 --> 05:48.396
Oh, let me pick this
up. I still have a job.

05:53.368 --> 05:56.237
Oh, my God. It's like this thing
is glued to the ground, Dan.

05:56.321 --> 05:58.656
Just try to make it look
like a regular crate, Gary,

05:58.707 --> 06:00.124
not Thor's hammer.

06:00.158 --> 06:01.575
I like that T-shirt.

06:01.577 --> 06:03.127
- Ma'am? Quincy Carter...
- Yes.

06:03.211 --> 06:05.746
The editor of the "New Hampshire
Globe" is here to speak with you.

06:05.748 --> 06:08.082
Oh, God. That Dickensian shitstack?

06:08.084 --> 06:10.584
Yeah, well, that shitstack can
swing the entire New Hampshire vote.

06:10.635 --> 06:12.470
That's why they call him "The Endorser."

06:12.504 --> 06:16.424
- Mr. Carter.
- Ma'am, a pleasure.

06:16.426 --> 06:18.342
I see you've brought your
soon-to-be-famous crate.

06:18.393 --> 06:21.429
- Ooh.
- See our online diary piece for details...

06:21.431 --> 06:23.848
- "Crate Expectations."
- Oh, I love it!

06:23.899 --> 06:26.767
- Gary, bring the crate over here.
- Okay, yeah.

06:26.818 --> 06:28.769
So, what's the piece gonna say?

06:28.771 --> 06:30.688
Oh, that it's been
reinforced with titanium.

06:30.739 --> 06:34.275
- Yes, it has.
- And that it cost $1,200 to make.

06:34.326 --> 06:36.444
What? No, it didn't.

06:36.495 --> 06:37.828
You'd have to be out of your mind

06:37.863 --> 06:39.447
to spend that kind of money for a crate.

06:39.498 --> 06:41.115
Well, according to the manufacturer.

06:41.117 --> 06:43.451
Uh, no, we don't
want... we don't want...

06:43.502 --> 06:45.086
Yeah. Okay.

06:45.120 --> 06:46.954
- Um...
- Go get Mike.

06:47.005 --> 06:49.924
- The thing is, Mr.Carter...
- Mm-hmm.

06:49.958 --> 06:52.543
You don't want to put
your foot through a crate.

06:52.594 --> 06:54.011
She thinks it looks folksy,

06:54.046 --> 06:56.514
but she really looks like
Dustin Hoffman on a crate.

06:56.548 --> 06:58.215
Stop it. That's mean.

06:58.266 --> 07:00.134
All right, I gotta get going.

07:00.185 --> 07:03.521
I gotta go make noises out of my
face hole or whatever it is I do.

07:03.555 --> 07:05.189
You know, Quincy's retiring.

07:05.223 --> 07:08.059
The "Globe" is gonna need somebody
who's willing to be sucked up to

07:08.110 --> 07:11.028
and who likes to eat a lot of lunches.

07:11.063 --> 07:12.480
Think you're man enough for that?

07:12.482 --> 07:14.448
Leave Selina? That's not possible.

07:14.483 --> 07:17.485
Is it? You would see a lot more of me.

07:17.536 --> 07:19.120
Oh, no. That's not good.

07:19.154 --> 07:21.489
I could go look at houses.

07:21.540 --> 07:24.158
Hey, Wendy. Mike, I know it seems
weird, but you're actually needed.

07:24.209 --> 07:26.494
- Let's go.
- Actually, I want to finish my muffin

07:26.545 --> 07:27.962
and then I'll go
get... are you...?

07:27.996 --> 07:29.964
I'm helping you out. Let's
go. No, let's go. Come on.

07:29.998 --> 07:31.999
- That's kinda mean.
- That's very rude.

07:32.001 --> 07:33.634
Oh, I so wish we could talk longer,

07:33.668 --> 07:36.170
but I'm afraid, yes, we've
got this... we've got...

07:36.172 --> 07:38.139
- Quincy?
- Michael!

07:38.173 --> 07:40.174
Thank you for the recipe.

07:40.176 --> 07:41.926
Did you have a nice vacation?

07:41.977 --> 07:43.844
The "Globe" is doing a piece on the crate.

07:43.846 --> 07:46.263
Oh, yeah, like it cost a million
dollars or something crazy.

07:46.314 --> 07:48.766
No, no, no, there's no story there, Quincy.

07:48.817 --> 07:50.184
Right, that's what I was saying to him.

07:50.235 --> 07:51.819
- Yes, exactly.
- I'll take care of this.

07:51.853 --> 07:53.687
Okay, great. Great.

07:53.689 --> 07:58.075
- What?
- Oh, my God. I cannot stand that affected butt plug.

07:58.110 --> 08:00.277
If I could lift the fucking crate,
I'd beat him to death with it.

08:00.328 --> 08:02.163
- Okay, we will get rid of him.
- Good news.

08:02.197 --> 08:04.532
Quincy's agreed to do a more
substantial in-depth interview.

08:04.534 --> 08:05.616
We'll schedule it for tomorrow.

08:05.667 --> 08:07.168
That would be the other option.

08:07.202 --> 08:08.669
<i>- Splendid.
- Yes.</i>

08:08.703 --> 08:09.870
Now I am away to lunch.

08:09.872 --> 08:11.505
Wine and branzini wait for no man.

08:11.540 --> 08:13.257
- Oh, my goodness.
- Until we meet again.

08:13.291 --> 08:15.259
<i>- Okay, bon appétit.
- Merci.</i>

08:15.293 --> 08:17.761
- You fucking douche.
- He is a character, though.

08:17.796 --> 08:20.714
I hate those. Hate.

08:20.716 --> 08:22.716
All right, so where is Kent?

08:22.718 --> 08:24.351
Uh, I think he's still with FLOTUS.

08:24.386 --> 08:26.720
Oh, God. I hope he doesn't
give her a crate to stand on.

08:26.722 --> 08:28.022
Otherwise she's gonna hang herself

08:28.056 --> 08:29.890
from the nearest light fixture.

08:31.143 --> 08:33.309
All right, call me anytime.

08:36.313 --> 08:39.283
Honey, come help Mom sort her pills.

08:39.366 --> 08:40.818
You used to love that.

08:40.869 --> 08:42.403
I screwed up, Mom.

08:42.405 --> 08:43.871
I should've never joined Maddox.

08:43.905 --> 08:45.990
And now he's finished
and I've come home to die.

08:46.041 --> 08:48.576
Well, can your DC friends help?

08:48.627 --> 08:50.828
I don't have any friends in DC, Mom.

08:50.879 --> 08:52.997
They all call me a dick behind my back.

08:53.048 --> 08:56.250
But, like, right behind
my back so I can hear them.

08:56.301 --> 08:59.003
Like you always said,
honey, "Haters gonna hate."

08:59.054 --> 09:01.055
Right, exactly.

09:01.089 --> 09:03.924
One day, they'll wish
they had listened to me.

09:03.926 --> 09:06.810
God, I wish I had a dirty bomb.

09:06.845 --> 09:08.929
Mom, do you think that you
could talk to Uncle Jeff for me?

09:08.931 --> 09:10.598
- No.
- I want a job on my own merits

09:10.649 --> 09:12.099
and I think that he's
the guy to get it for me.

09:12.101 --> 09:13.601
You know, we're not on good terms.

09:13.603 --> 09:15.436
You don't have to fuck him,
Mom. You just have to call him.

09:15.487 --> 09:17.404
- What?
- Don't give me that look.

09:17.439 --> 09:19.106
- All right.
- It's how DC people talk.

09:19.157 --> 09:21.525
- I know.
- If you wanna walk the walk, you have to talk that talk.

09:21.576 --> 09:22.943
Okay.

09:23.028 --> 09:26.030
It's not a radical stance
on immigration at all.

09:26.081 --> 09:28.082
It's really more of a practical stance.

09:28.116 --> 09:30.167
Ma'am, that is going
to fly with our readers.

09:30.202 --> 09:34.705
- Oh, good.
- And, finally, ma'am, might I ask you the QQQ?

09:34.756 --> 09:36.123
"Quincy's Quirky Questions"?

09:36.174 --> 09:38.842
- Yes.
- I ask the same questions of everyone I interview.

09:38.877 --> 09:40.678
<i>A little spécialité de la maison.</i>

09:40.712 --> 09:43.097
<i>Ah, magnifique.</i>

09:43.131 --> 09:46.884
What person, living or
dead, do you most despise?

09:46.935 --> 09:48.969
I really try not to hate anybody

09:49.020 --> 09:52.640
because I think it's a
negative use of energy

09:52.691 --> 09:54.475
to hate another human being.

09:54.526 --> 09:56.610
Ah. Most people say Hitler.

09:57.979 --> 10:01.782
Um, well, yeah, certainly.
I'm not a fan of Hitler.

10:01.816 --> 10:03.867
So, change it to Hitler?

10:03.902 --> 10:06.203
Okay, Hitler, yeah.

10:06.238 --> 10:08.822
What would you alter
about your personality?

10:08.873 --> 10:11.158
Hmm.

10:11.209 --> 10:14.878
I guess I would say that I
can be a little bit impatient.

10:14.913 --> 10:18.999
- Oh, God, yes, you can... be.
- No.

10:19.001 --> 10:21.335
So I guess I would...
I should change that.

10:21.386 --> 10:23.220
Neil Diamond gave the same answer.

10:23.255 --> 10:25.172
Oh, what fun. I love him.

10:25.174 --> 10:27.057
"Sweet Caroline" is so good,

10:27.092 --> 10:28.342
and "Cracklin'
Rosie" is just...

10:28.393 --> 10:30.894
Why does God allow suffering?

10:30.929 --> 10:36.016
Um, well, I wouldn't ever
presume to know the mind of God...

10:36.067 --> 10:39.486
Siri, why
does God allow suffering?

10:39.521 --> 10:43.741
I think that suffering can
engender a kind of resilience.

10:43.775 --> 10:47.695
Although that doesn't really
explain childhood cancers and...

10:47.746 --> 10:51.365
"Childhood cancers." Excellent answer.

10:51.416 --> 10:53.951
Shall we halt there? I
have a recital to attend.

10:54.002 --> 10:55.953
Well, I don't want to keep you from that.

10:56.004 --> 10:58.289
<i>Oh, well. Toujours un
plaisir. Jamais un travail.</i>

10:58.340 --> 11:00.207
"Always a pleasure. Never a chore."

11:00.258 --> 11:02.760
Yes, there you go. I
love the French talking.

11:02.794 --> 11:04.595
It's wonderful. Thank you so much.

11:04.629 --> 11:06.714
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

11:06.765 --> 11:10.551
He has his head so up his
ass, he can wave out his mouth.

11:10.602 --> 11:12.186
I mean, honestly.

11:12.220 --> 11:14.054
<i>Ma'am, we have a donation offer</i>

11:14.105 --> 11:16.724
from Oliveri Systems for $4,000.

11:16.775 --> 11:19.727
Four grand? That's not even
worth cashing the check.

11:19.729 --> 11:22.029
I'll have the guys call back. It is GUMMI.

11:22.063 --> 11:23.897
Gummi? What's that?

11:23.948 --> 11:26.317
GUMMI... Give Us
More Money, Idiot.

11:26.368 --> 11:28.152
- Oh.
- Who changed the code?

11:28.203 --> 11:29.570
What happened
to HADDA...

11:29.621 --> 11:31.121
How About Digging Deeper, Assholes?

11:31.156 --> 11:33.324
I always call them dicks.

11:33.375 --> 11:35.125
It doesn't stand for anything.

11:37.128 --> 11:39.463
Oh, shit.

11:39.497 --> 11:40.998
What do I do? What do I do?

11:41.049 --> 11:42.916
I don't want it!

11:44.919 --> 11:46.220
There, it's not recording anymore.

11:46.254 --> 11:47.755
- Delete it.
- It knows too much.

11:47.806 --> 11:49.757
- Delete it.
- You can't delete it because if you do,

11:49.808 --> 11:51.175
then he'll know we did
it and he'll think we said

11:51.226 --> 11:53.310
some terrible things, which we did.

11:53.345 --> 11:55.095
- Who cares?
- Let's just throw it in the toilet.

11:55.097 --> 11:57.981
- And say what, Mike?
- That we dropped it in the toilet.

11:58.016 --> 11:59.733
Guys, guys, guys, you
better decide quickly.

11:59.768 --> 12:01.235
Ah, too late. Went into sleep mode.

12:01.269 --> 12:03.270
Quincy's heading back
up. He forgot his phone.

12:03.272 --> 12:06.023
Oh. Uh, Gary,
g-g-go stall him.

12:06.074 --> 12:07.324
- Yeah.
- No.

12:07.359 --> 12:09.493
<i>- You need to stall him.
- Go, go.</i>

12:09.527 --> 12:11.278
It's password protected.

12:11.329 --> 12:12.913
- Fuck.
- Hang on, hang on.

12:12.947 --> 12:15.833
0001, 0002...

12:16.918 --> 12:20.254
You cannot be serious.

12:21.756 --> 12:24.792
Mr. Carter, hi. Gary Walsh.

12:24.843 --> 12:26.460
I just wanted to say I'm a big fan.

12:26.462 --> 12:30.297
Oh, thank you. You are from the
South. I hear it in your voice.

12:30.348 --> 12:33.884
- I am. Alabama.
- I just need to retrieve my cell phone.

12:33.968 --> 12:35.686
You can't go in there
at the moment, I'm sorry.

12:35.720 --> 12:37.938
- Why not?
- I don't know.

12:37.972 --> 12:40.974
- Matters of state?
- I don't know.

12:41.025 --> 12:42.726
I see.

12:42.777 --> 12:44.478
So, where exactly in Alabama are you from?

12:44.480 --> 12:46.814
Don't know.

12:46.865 --> 12:49.483
Birmingham. Have you heard of Birmingham?

12:49.485 --> 12:51.819
- It is a lovely...
- I really do need my cell.

12:51.870 --> 12:54.705
- I'm gonna go talk to them for just a second.
- Let's both do that.

12:54.739 --> 12:56.657
It locked me out.

12:56.659 --> 12:59.042
- Smash it.
- Are you kidding?

12:59.077 --> 13:01.628
- No, I'm not kidding. Violence solves everything.
- Ma'am, ma'am, ma'am.

13:01.663 --> 13:03.831
- Just sma...
- You have it. Marvelous.

13:03.833 --> 13:05.249
- Madam Vice President.
- Oh, hello.

13:05.300 --> 13:06.383
No, the light bulb's fine, see?

13:06.418 --> 13:08.168
<i>- Oh, all right. Yeah.
- See? Yeah.</i>

13:08.170 --> 13:11.338
I was just admiring it. Your
charging portal is so clean.

13:11.389 --> 13:13.340
- Do you swab it?
- No.

13:13.391 --> 13:15.175
But for this relief, much thanks.

13:15.226 --> 13:19.480
Exit, pursued by a bear.

13:23.184 --> 13:26.353
First I want to apologize for
what I said last time we spoke.

13:26.355 --> 13:28.238
You know when I've had a
drink, I can be a little...

13:28.273 --> 13:29.356
A bit of a bitch.

13:29.358 --> 13:31.608
Be a little feisty.

13:31.659 --> 13:34.027
So, how's the family?

13:34.078 --> 13:36.330
Oh, Lucy's...
Lucy's engaged.

13:36.364 --> 13:38.198
- Who cares?
- That's wonderful.

13:38.200 --> 13:40.367
Yeah, I'm good. I had one
of my blood sugar episodes

13:40.369 --> 13:41.702
at CVS the other day...

13:41.704 --> 13:43.203
Mom, nobody cares.

13:43.205 --> 13:45.672
- But I tell you what.
- Get to it.

13:45.707 --> 13:47.758
I'm calling, Jeff, because I was wondering

13:47.792 --> 13:51.795
if maybe you could make a call over
to Governor Chung's campaign team

13:51.846 --> 13:53.380
and tell them that JJ needs a job.

13:53.431 --> 13:55.716
No, no, JJ has a lot of job offers.

13:55.718 --> 13:57.468
JJ has a lot of job offers.

13:57.552 --> 13:59.603
- And maybe Governor Chung...
- And maybe Governor Chung...

13:59.637 --> 14:00.888
would want to snap him up.

14:00.939 --> 14:03.023
- ...want to snap him right up.
- Yeah.

14:03.057 --> 14:05.058
Yeah, yeah, I know he can be.

14:05.109 --> 14:09.062
But I was just wondering, do you
think you could help us out, Jeff?

14:09.064 --> 14:11.732
- Oh!
- What's he saying? What's he saying?

14:11.734 --> 14:14.368
Okay. Oh, he's gonna be
thrilled when I tell him.

14:14.402 --> 14:15.452
Yes!

14:15.487 --> 14:17.621
<i>So, Lucy... is
she pregnant?</i>

14:19.574 --> 14:21.575
<i>No, I wasn't accusing.</i>

14:21.626 --> 14:23.744
I was just asking, is she pregnant?

14:23.746 --> 14:25.629
What is wrong with you?

14:25.663 --> 14:27.631
<i>Well, we all know she's no angel.</i>

14:27.665 --> 14:30.167
She does drugs. She's
got that tattoo...

14:35.925 --> 14:39.343
Mom, what happened?

14:39.394 --> 14:43.430
He hung up. He's such a jackass.

14:44.766 --> 14:47.100
But he's gonna make the
call to Chung, right?

14:47.102 --> 14:50.270
- That's not gonna happen.
- Oh, Mom!

14:50.272 --> 14:52.356
Oh, you are so annoying!

14:52.407 --> 14:54.992
How do you not just punch
yourself in the face?

14:55.026 --> 14:58.362
- Call him back.
- He's not going to answer.

14:58.413 --> 14:59.863
Who else can we call?

14:59.914 --> 15:02.449
Oh, I don't know, Mom. Is
there anyone else in our family

15:02.500 --> 15:04.618
that controls the senior
citizen vote in New England?

15:04.620 --> 15:06.837
Because that'd be my next fucking call.

15:06.871 --> 15:10.007
This community center, it's got
volunteers and homeless people?

15:10.041 --> 15:12.042
And is there anybody else there?

15:12.093 --> 15:14.628
An immigrant family from Syria who
had a horrific time getting to America.

15:14.630 --> 15:16.380
They're gonna be good to talk to.

15:16.464 --> 15:19.299
Oh, ma'am, Oliveri Systems
just withdrew its donations

15:19.301 --> 15:20.467
<i>and so has Dugdale Recycling.</i>

15:20.518 --> 15:21.885
<i>Just now.</i>

15:21.936 --> 15:23.971
Yeah, it's out there.

15:24.055 --> 15:26.473
Quincy ran an online
piece about the GUMMI code.

15:26.524 --> 15:28.559
- You're kidding.
- No.

15:28.610 --> 15:31.445
I've got it right here.

15:31.479 --> 15:33.981
"Any organization donating
to the Meyer campaign

15:33.983 --> 15:36.984
may want to reflect on
how its tightfisted idiocy

15:36.986 --> 15:39.653
is mocked by the woman
on the $1,200 crate."

15:48.796 --> 15:52.549
Okay, well... ahem.

15:52.584 --> 15:55.419
Well, there's...
there's just...

15:55.470 --> 15:57.421
there's no way out of this.

15:59.090 --> 16:02.476
I mean, you know, not for
a sitting vice president

16:02.510 --> 16:05.512
who's lost Iowa and New Hampshire.

16:06.598 --> 16:08.015
You know what VP stands for?

16:08.066 --> 16:12.519
It stands for "Victory Permafucked."

16:14.405 --> 16:16.023
I don't deserve this.

16:16.025 --> 16:17.574
You know? God damn it.

16:17.609 --> 16:19.860
I don't, but you do

16:19.911 --> 16:23.246
because you are all losers!

16:23.331 --> 16:26.083
Every motherfucking one of you.

16:26.117 --> 16:28.368
Loser! Loser!

16:35.843 --> 16:39.129
Madam Vice President, are all your
donors idiots or just a select few?

16:41.849 --> 16:43.884
Is this your idea of fiscal responsibility?

16:43.886 --> 16:45.385
- I'm Amy Brookheimer.
- Relax, relax.

16:45.387 --> 16:47.554
- A little room, please.
- Hypertension kills.

16:47.556 --> 16:49.640
- It's such an honor.
- Did you know how much that crate cost?

16:49.691 --> 16:52.442
- And when did you know it?
- The vice president is not here to answer questions.

16:52.477 --> 16:53.810
She's here to reach out to the community.

16:53.861 --> 16:55.896
Listen, I'm so sorry about all of this.

16:55.947 --> 16:58.815
You're asking a rhetorical question
and the answer is obviously no.

16:58.866 --> 17:00.567
- See this?
- Mm-hmm.

17:00.569 --> 17:03.987
I'm done. I'm done.

17:04.038 --> 17:05.571
Take your lithium, jag-offs.

17:05.574 --> 17:07.240
<i>God, it's so
good to hear your voice.</i>

17:07.242 --> 17:09.459
No, it's going much worse.

17:09.493 --> 17:11.828
Let's find us a house, Wendy,

17:11.878 --> 17:13.329
where we can keep ducks.

17:13.381 --> 17:15.248
For us and the ducks.

17:15.250 --> 17:16.800
Of course, the kids, too.

17:16.834 --> 17:19.252
- Mike.
- I have to go see homeless people.

17:19.253 --> 17:21.805
And see if there's one with a pool.

17:21.839 --> 17:23.507
This is Elida and Fadi.

17:23.558 --> 17:25.759
Hello, hi.

17:25.810 --> 17:28.095
Oh, I really want to hear your story.

17:28.097 --> 17:29.513
It is not a nice one.

17:29.564 --> 17:35.068
No, life can be... very challenging.

17:35.103 --> 17:37.821
<i>I mean, sometimes through
no fault of your own,</i>

17:37.855 --> 17:42.909
it's just one... disaster

17:42.944 --> 17:44.945
after another disaster.

17:46.164 --> 17:47.831
Syria is very troubled.

17:47.865 --> 17:50.784
Hmm? Oh, mm-hmm. Right.

17:50.835 --> 17:54.621
Ahem, ma'am, um, Kent is here.

17:54.623 --> 17:56.456
He's acting weird.

17:56.458 --> 17:59.843
Not normal weird, weird-weird.

17:59.877 --> 18:02.295
What does that mean?

18:03.631 --> 18:05.132
Kent.

18:05.183 --> 18:08.351
- Ma'am...
- What, are you okay?

18:08.386 --> 18:11.888
Kind of, in a way, and also not.

18:11.939 --> 18:14.391
And in a third way both.

18:14.442 --> 18:16.643
What are you talking about?
What is it? Are we at war?

18:16.728 --> 18:19.112
Ma'am, we're America. We're always at war.

18:19.147 --> 18:23.784
Uh, the first lady...
isn't in a good place.

18:23.818 --> 18:25.986
Oh, the hospital.

18:26.037 --> 18:27.487
Mentally.

18:27.538 --> 18:30.073
POTUS has decided that he wants to devote

18:30.124 --> 18:32.909
more time to looking after her.

18:32.960 --> 18:34.911
Yikes.

18:34.962 --> 18:36.880
- At any rate...
- Yeah.

18:36.914 --> 18:38.749
He's gonna resign.

18:38.800 --> 18:41.668
Oh. What?

18:41.719 --> 18:45.172
Ma'am, you're about to become the
45th President of the United States.

18:45.174 --> 18:48.141
It's not a dress rehearsal, not a drill.

18:48.176 --> 18:52.345
You are going to be the president.

18:52.347 --> 18:53.680
Now?

18:53.682 --> 18:55.599
We're not sure when, but very soon.

18:58.520 --> 19:01.021
Uh... ahem.

19:01.072 --> 19:04.524
Where's POTUS gonna live, though?

19:04.526 --> 19:08.328
- Where is he...
- Yeah, 'cause doesn't he have to move?

19:08.362 --> 19:10.330
Well, yeah, but that's
none of your concern.

19:10.364 --> 19:12.365
- That'll be taken care of.
- No, but does he have a house?

19:12.416 --> 19:13.283
Somebody will handle that.

19:13.334 --> 19:15.452
You don't have to worry about that.

19:18.873 --> 19:20.423
You okay?

19:20.458 --> 19:23.043
I just... I just have
to go to the bathroom.

19:23.094 --> 19:24.427
Do you know where it is?

19:24.462 --> 19:26.046
I think it's behind you.

19:32.770 --> 19:35.021
Ma'am? Excuse me.

19:39.560 --> 19:41.278
Ma'am? Ma'am?

19:44.232 --> 19:46.650
Hi, ma'am. You all right?

19:47.652 --> 19:49.069
Yeah?

19:49.120 --> 19:52.539
- Gary...
- Yeah, ma'am?

19:52.573 --> 19:56.326
Um, I'm gonna be president.

19:56.377 --> 19:59.713
Of course you are.

19:59.747 --> 20:01.248
I mean, there's always hope, ma'am.

20:01.250 --> 20:03.133
We've got plenty of hope in this world.

20:03.167 --> 20:06.336
No, no, no, no. I mean, um...

20:06.420 --> 20:10.841
POTUS is gonna resign...

20:10.892 --> 20:13.260
and I'm about to become president...

20:13.311 --> 20:16.396
of America!

20:19.600 --> 20:22.068
No, no, no. Oh, don't cry.

20:22.103 --> 20:24.271
Don't cry.

20:24.273 --> 20:26.072
Oh, oh...
uh-oh.

20:26.107 --> 20:27.607
Your nose is bleeding.

20:27.609 --> 20:29.025
<i>You're bleeding.</i>

20:29.076 --> 20:30.660
<i>Oh, my God, you're bleeding.</i>

20:30.695 --> 20:31.945
Oh,
Gary...

20:31.947 --> 20:33.947
<i>When I get
excited, my nose bleeds.</i>

20:33.949 --> 20:36.449
- What?
- When I get excited, my nose bleeds!

20:36.500 --> 20:37.834
Okay, you've gotta sit down.

20:37.869 --> 20:39.419
Wait, you've gotta sit down.

20:39.453 --> 20:41.955
Gary, you've gotta sit
down and put your head back.

20:42.006 --> 20:43.373
- Put your head back.
- When I get excited...

20:43.424 --> 20:45.675
- Put your head back.
- When I get excited, my nose bleeds.

20:45.710 --> 20:48.378
Well, that's good.
Wait, let me get you...

20:48.429 --> 20:49.930
oh, shit.

20:49.964 --> 20:54.100
Gary, there's...

20:54.135 --> 20:57.103
- There's no toilet paper.
-  Go in my bag.

20:57.138 --> 20:58.471
<i>- What?
- Go in my bag.</i>

20:58.522 --> 20:59.973
It's in my bag.

21:00.024 --> 21:01.975
Okay.

21:01.977 --> 21:03.810
It's in the...
it's in the...

21:03.812 --> 21:05.528
What? Where is it?

21:05.563 --> 21:07.564
It's in the outer...
it's in the outer pocket.

21:07.615 --> 21:09.733
Wait,
what...

21:09.784 --> 21:13.286
what is this for?

21:13.321 --> 21:16.122
Oh, shit. That looks bad through here.

21:17.742 --> 21:21.161
Stick these in your nose.

21:21.212 --> 21:24.331
Shove these up there.

21:24.415 --> 21:27.167
That'll do the trick.

21:28.419 --> 21:31.171
Why is there a bicycle book?

21:31.222 --> 21:34.257
Gary,
seriously, why...

21:34.308 --> 21:35.842
Oh, my God. You look so disgusting.

21:35.844 --> 21:37.560
I love bicycles.

21:37.595 --> 21:39.512
Oh, I got it. Here, I got it.

21:39.563 --> 21:41.848
I got it. Here, shove these in.

21:41.850 --> 21:44.734
Shove these in.

21:44.819 --> 21:47.520
We gotta get
out... uh-oh.

21:47.571 --> 21:49.522
Everything all right?

21:53.661 --> 21:55.528
Great.

21:55.530 --> 21:58.081
I need to go.

22:02.837 --> 22:03.870
Amy, Amy, Amy, Amy.

22:03.921 --> 22:05.372
Jesus, what
the fuck happened to you?

22:05.374 --> 22:08.375
Shh, listen, listen. The
president is resigning.

22:08.377 --> 22:10.343
Selina is gonna be president.

22:12.546 --> 22:13.880
What's going on? What's up?

22:13.931 --> 22:16.383
POTUS is resigning. Selina's president.

22:18.803 --> 22:21.554
POTUS is stepping
down. Selina's gonna be president.

22:21.639 --> 22:24.057
Fuck off!

22:24.108 --> 22:28.111
POTUS is gonna resign.
Selina is gonna be president.

22:29.398 --> 22:31.197
Oh, shit.

22:32.199 --> 22:34.818
I was gonna raise ducks.

22:36.070 --> 22:38.071
<i>Okay, take two.</i>

22:38.073 --> 22:40.623
I'm so sorry I went away, but now I'm back.

22:40.658 --> 22:42.826
<i>Fadi and Elida,
they've had a terrible time.</i>

22:42.877 --> 22:44.160
No. Oh, I bet they have.

22:44.211 --> 22:45.996
<i>They just arrived a month ago.</i>

22:46.047 --> 22:47.630
At Rye Harbor.

22:47.665 --> 22:50.333
Oh, Rye Harbor. Oh, that's lovely.

22:50.384 --> 22:55.221
So you had a safe arrival, which
means that Lady Luck was with you.

22:55.256 --> 22:57.090
Our journey was like a horrible dream.

22:57.141 --> 22:58.591
Mm, right.

22:58.642 --> 23:01.394
At one time, we hid in
a well for five days.

23:01.429 --> 23:02.846
Oh, good Lord.

23:02.897 --> 23:04.481
A well.

23:04.515 --> 23:06.900
- Ahem.
- Yeah?

23:06.934 --> 23:11.905
Um, it's happening in 48 hours.

23:13.858 --> 23:15.275
<i>Okay, I gotta go,</i>

23:15.326 --> 23:18.862
but, gosh, good luck with
all of your terrible troubles

23:18.913 --> 23:22.032
and, um, welcome to America.

23:26.537 --> 23:28.455
Shh, shh, shh.

23:28.457 --> 23:30.957
Winner,
winner, winner, winner, winner.

23:31.008 --> 23:32.959
Winner, winner, winner.

23:32.961 --> 23:37.263
Okay, okay, so as weird as this may seem...

23:37.298 --> 23:38.631
Okay.

23:38.633 --> 23:40.300
You are still running a campaign.

23:40.351 --> 23:41.768
Oh, my God, right.

23:41.802 --> 23:43.720
- So somebody has to be here.
- Right.

23:43.771 --> 23:45.772
Obviously, I have to go
with you because I'm...

23:45.806 --> 23:48.441
- My campaign manager.
- Yeah, and we'll talk Chief of Staff.

23:48.476 --> 23:50.643
Oh. And you have to come with me, Ben.

23:50.645 --> 23:51.811
That's what all the chicks say.

23:51.813 --> 23:54.481
Shh!

23:54.532 --> 23:56.199
- And, Mike, I need you.
- Yes, you do.

23:56.233 --> 23:58.785
And obviously I need to come
with you 'cause you need my...

23:58.819 --> 24:00.153
Ruthless eye.

24:00.204 --> 24:03.873
Yeah, I have no soul.

24:03.908 --> 24:05.158
- And, Gary...
- Yeah?

24:05.160 --> 24:07.327
- I need you to stay.
- What?

24:07.329 --> 24:08.995
Yeah, I need you to stay here

24:09.046 --> 24:10.880
to be the face of the
campaign and everything, okay?

24:10.915 --> 24:12.332
What?

24:12.383 --> 24:15.835
And then tomorrow, you take
a commercial flight back to DC

24:15.886 --> 24:18.338
and then we can talk inauguration shoes.

24:18.389 --> 24:20.723
Okay, ma'am, but this is
the most important moment

24:20.758 --> 24:22.225
of my... of
your life.

24:22.259 --> 24:24.477
It's going. It's going.

24:24.512 --> 24:27.764
Sorry, I just feel like it was...

24:27.815 --> 24:29.682
<i>I'd be right next to you.</i>

24:29.684 --> 24:31.985
I mean, I would absolutely
agree that that would be me.

24:32.019 --> 24:35.155
<i>This is better than any of the sex I've ever had.</i>

24:35.189 --> 24:36.689
I mean, almost any of it.

24:36.740 --> 24:39.409
I feel sick, but it's
just in my neck, you know?

24:39.443 --> 24:43.196
Wow, only 44 other senior press advisors

24:43.247 --> 24:44.781
have ever felt like this.

24:44.832 --> 24:47.367
That's right, yeah. We're
the chosen ones, bud.

24:47.369 --> 24:49.369
Wow, it really is all about you, isn't it?

24:49.371 --> 24:52.922
<i>The president announced
that he will be stepping down</i>

24:52.957 --> 24:55.008
<i>with immediate effect in
order to help his wife...</i>

24:55.042 --> 24:57.544
<i>- deal with her illness.
- Oh, no.</i>

24:57.546 --> 24:59.345
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

24:59.380 --> 25:01.548
No, no, no, no. Fuck me.

25:06.887 --> 25:10.023
Is this... is this
soup vegetarian?

25:10.057 --> 25:12.559
- I think it's vegan.
- Ah, nice.

25:12.561 --> 25:15.028
So maybe one or two types of beans?

25:15.062 --> 25:17.730
I wouldn't know. I don't make the soup.

25:17.781 --> 25:19.983
Oh, maybe three, actually.

25:20.034 --> 25:21.901
- I don't know.
- Yeah.

25:21.952 --> 25:25.121
Someone has just flown
two planes into my career.

25:25.156 --> 25:27.740
My heart is racing,
like, 200 miles an hour.

25:27.742 --> 25:31.794
Me, too, but that's normal for
me 'cause I'm not a healthy man.

25:31.829 --> 25:33.296
I don't understand this,

25:33.330 --> 25:35.548
'cause yesterday we were all
doing jokes about the box,

25:35.583 --> 25:37.250
now she's
commander-in-chief.

25:37.252 --> 25:38.585
How is this happened?

25:38.636 --> 25:41.171
So, what's it like working
for the vice president?

25:41.222 --> 25:45.758
It's my greatest joy just
to stand by her every day,

25:45.809 --> 25:47.427
just to be by her side.

25:47.478 --> 25:49.562
Buy yourself a gun, Mom,

25:49.597 --> 25:51.931
because America's gonna have
to shoot its way out of this.

25:51.982 --> 25:53.933
Does she often leave you behind?

25:53.984 --> 25:55.768
No, this is the first time.

26:00.908 --> 26:02.775
Oh, I didn't get any salad.

26:02.826 --> 26:05.445
Oh, God, Mom. No, make this stop.

26:05.447 --> 26:06.446
Oh, okay, okay.

26:06.497 --> 26:09.165
No, don't turn it off, Mom.

26:09.200 --> 26:13.953
Whoa, this must be what
it feels like to be happy.

26:15.956 --> 26:17.957
Ma'am, are you okay?

26:20.010 --> 26:22.762
I'm gonna be the fucking president.
