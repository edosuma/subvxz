Arthur Nielsen

00:04.800 --> 00:05.500
You can call me Artie

00:06.000 --> 00:08.400
- I'm thrilled you're on the team.
- What team? What is this place?

00:08.500 --> 00:12.200
You're both joining me as fellow
gatherers and protectors of secrets.

00:12.300 --> 00:13.000
Ms. Bering, Mr. Lattimer,

00:14.600 --> 00:17.200
Welcome, to Warehouse 13

00:18.300 --> 00:20.700
Can we get back to the Warehouse computer being breached?

00:20.900 --> 00:22.900
Somebody is poking around your system

00:23.000 --> 00:24.900
Warehouse 13

00:25.300 --> 00:26.500
I got hacked

00:28.000 --> 00:34.074

01:23.700 --> 01:26.100
Myka, I can use a hand down here.

01:26.300 --> 01:29.100
I'm distracting the gendarmes first, that was the plan, remember?

01:29.200 --> 01:30.800
Did you switch out the blade yet?

01:30.900 --> 01:33.000
If I had I wouldn't be calling you, would I?

01:33.100 --> 01:34.400
Hang tight, I will be there in two

01:53.600 --> 01:54.900
Uh, Pete, time's up.

01:55.300 --> 01:56.800
Come on. Almost there.

02:03.000 --> 02:04.400
Now I’ve got you.

02:08.600 --> 02:09.400
Ahh!

02:19.500 --> 02:20.100
Damn it.

02:33.300 --> 02:34.500
Very nice.

02:35.600 --> 02:37.400
You must be super fun on a date.

02:37.600 --> 02:38.800
Guys love that.

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
All kick-Ass action and no talking.

02:41.400 --> 02:42.700
I switched the blade.

02:43.700 --> 02:44.900
You didn't follow the plan.

02:45.800 --> 02:47.300
Now hurry before they get up.

02:47.800 --> 02:49.600
I'm sorry. News flash.

02:50.100 --> 02:52.200
Your plan wasn't working.

02:52.300 --> 02:53.400
Are you forgetting something?

02:59.700 --> 03:00.400
Let's go.

03:02.400 --> 03:04.700
I was just...keeping you on your toes.

03:04.800 --> 03:06.000
Right. It’s always my toes.

03:06.100 --> 03:06.900
What about your toes?

03:19.800 --> 03:22.600
Suicide attacks ripped through
areas in and around Baghdad today...

03:22.700 --> 03:23.800
In the form of protests and...

03:25.600 --> 03:27.700
In order to assist Hungary
in avoiding an all...

03:49.900 --> 03:51.300
Sister Grace

04:27.600 --> 04:29.100
Sister grace, come down.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.100
You got to see this.

04:55.500 --> 04:56.600
You got to see this.

05:21.000 --> 05:21.600
Don't jump.

05:21.700 --> 05:23.300
Sister grace, come down.

05:24.600 --> 05:28.200
Miraculously, sister Grace Ellen
Only suffered minor injuries

05:28.300 --> 05:32.600
And is listed in stable condition
at a local hospital here in Unionville.

05:32.700 --> 05:34.600
Adele Poro, channel six news.

05:34.900 --> 05:36.800
What's going on there in Unionville?

05:36.900 --> 05:41.400
Okay, Marie Antoinette guillotine
blade Bagged, tagged, and on the shelf.

05:41.600 --> 05:44.200
Congratulations, but remember
to charge the Tesla next time.

05:44.400 --> 05:46.500
You still going on about the Tesla?

05:46.800 --> 05:49.900
No, Pete, what I am
going on about is protocol.

05:50.000 --> 05:52.100
I mean, you do know how
to read, don't you?

05:52.200 --> 05:53.000
You know when you frown,

05:53.100 --> 05:56.500
that premature wrinkle line in
your forehead gets a little more prominent.

05:56.700 --> 05:59.200
You just hate it when
I’m right, that's all.

05:59.300 --> 06:00.300
Thank God that never happens.

06:00.800 --> 06:03.100
You know what I don't get about you?

06:03.200 --> 06:05.500
-Guys?
-How I wake up in the morning looking this good?

06:05.600 --> 06:06.400
No, no, Pete.

06:06.500 --> 06:10.900
What I don't get is your pathological need to ignore authority, okay?
-Guys?

06:11.200 --> 06:12.100
-Oh, my god.
Guys?

06:12.200 --> 06:13.800
-You were not in charge in Paris.
-Can you hear me?

06:13.900 --> 06:15.200
Well, neither were you.

06:15.300 --> 06:16.200
Well, neither were you.

06:16.300 --> 06:18.100
What is that?
You are like a child.

06:18.200 --> 06:21.300
Watch your negative energy.

06:21.400 --> 06:24.100
-You're like an uptight control freak.
-The warehouse will do bad things.

06:24.200 --> 06:25.200
- Oh no!
- No!

06:25.400 --> 06:26.600
No, no, no.
Don't do it.

06:26.700 --> 06:28.400
-Don't you do it.
-Thank you very much miss community college!

06:28.500 --> 06:29.600
- Miss community college.
- Miss community college?

06:41.500 --> 06:42.200
I bet you were a real--

06:42.300 --> 06:45.000
I suggest you close your eyes.

06:56.800 --> 06:57.900
Had to be done.

You know, it's gonna have

07:57.600 --> 07:59.100
And as I keep telling you repeatedly,

07:59.300 --> 08:01.600
All things have a magnetic context,

08:01.700 --> 08:03.300
Especially things in that warehouse.

08:03.400 --> 08:06.300
Pete, you cannot go into that place
with so much negative energy.

08:06.400 --> 08:07.300
You want to fight with her? Fine.

08:07.400 --> 08:08.800
Fight with her, but not there.

08:09.200 --> 08:11.200
One of us has to be in
charge out in the field.

08:11.300 --> 08:12.000
Don't you think?

08:12.500 --> 08:14.200
You haven't listened to
a word I’ve said, have you?

08:14.800 --> 08:15.800
Yeah, yeah.

08:15.900 --> 08:19.600
I'm just saying somebody leads,
somebody follows, right?

08:19.900 --> 08:22.400
I mean, I have more experience, more know-How.

08:22.500 --> 08:24.400
I'm more grounded.

08:24.700 --> 08:26.600
Pete, you're the obvious choice here.

08:26.800 --> 08:28.200
-Well, I--
- Listen

08:28.400 --> 08:29.300
Do me a favor, will you?

08:29.400 --> 08:31.400
You let Myka think
that she's running things,

08:31.500 --> 08:33.500
Because really, she's
very, very, very sensitive.

08:35.299 --> 08:36.600
Sometimes I just
want to punch him.

08:36.900 --> 08:38.500
He reminds me of my father, you know?

08:38.600 --> 08:39.600
He's arrogant.

08:39.700 --> 08:40.900
I think he's kind of sexy.

08:41.400 --> 08:42.700
So not my type.

08:42.799 --> 08:44.600
Really? What’s your type?

08:44.700 --> 08:45.600
I don't know, Leena.

08:45.700 --> 08:47.500
Opposable thumbs maybe?

08:47.600 --> 08:49.100
Hello, ladies.

08:49.300 --> 08:51.600
We're not interrupting
girl talk are we?

08:51.800 --> 08:53.600
Like now, see?
I could punch him right now.

08:54.300 --> 08:55.500
All right, game time.

08:55.700 --> 08:56.600
Come on. Come on.

08:58.900 --> 08:59.500
Come on.

09:03.400 --> 09:05.400
A nun, a teenager,
and an old lady

09:05.500 --> 09:08.200
All acting strangely
in Unionville, Colorado.

09:08.400 --> 09:09.900
I have research here that indicates

09:10.000 --> 09:12.100
That each of these people knew
exactly what they were doing.

09:12.200 --> 09:15.100
The thing is they couldn't stop
themselves from doing it for some reason.

09:15.200 --> 09:17.800
Well, could there be a practical explanation?

09:18.000 --> 09:19.200
Something in the water?

09:19.300 --> 09:20.100
Nothing. I checked.

09:20.200 --> 09:21.800
Maybe it's just a bad flu bug.

09:22.400 --> 09:25.600
Well, only three cases in a town of
thousands indicates it was something non-Viral.

09:25.700 --> 09:27.600
Although I still need to rule
out anything bacterial,

09:27.700 --> 09:30.300
Parasitic, priotic,
virotic, and of course fungal.

09:30.600 --> 09:31.600
I was kidding.

09:31.900 --> 09:34.700
No, no, never rule out anything
until you've ruled it out.

09:35.000 --> 09:37.500
Oh, and I want you guys
to ask each of the victims

09:37.600 --> 09:39.800
My list of field recovery questions.

09:39.900 --> 09:42.700
-Artie, not the questions, please?
-God, they're embarrassing.

09:42.800 --> 09:44.000
Yeah, my only pleasure left in life.

09:44.100 --> 09:46.100
Concocting ways to embarrass you.

09:46.200 --> 09:48.200
Here, in case you lost them.

09:49.000 --> 09:49.600
Take this.

09:50.700 --> 09:55.200
You know, how can it matter If a
person smells fudge before an incident?

09:55.400 --> 09:59.000
Yeah, or if your gall bladder is feeling numb?

09:59.200 --> 10:00.000
Humor me.

10:00.800 --> 10:02.300
All right, I want you
to go to Unionville.

10:02.400 --> 10:04.100
Find out if these three people
are connected in some way.

10:04.200 --> 10:06.600
And if they are, is there
an artifact At the center of it?

10:06.700 --> 10:08.000
If there is, bring it home. Simple.

10:08.700 --> 10:09.400
Easy peasy.

10:09.500 --> 10:10.800
Oh, a transpo.

10:11.200 --> 10:12.900
My truck's still in lake Michigan.

10:13.000 --> 10:13.800
God, that was cold.

10:13.900 --> 10:14.500
Word.

10:16.900 --> 10:17.500
all right.

10:18.300 --> 10:19.000
Take my car.

10:20.000 --> 10:21.700
Just--Ah! No food, no drink.

10:21.900 --> 10:22.800
Don't go over 55.

10:22.900 --> 10:24.600
Don't park near anything.

10:26.100 --> 10:26.700
What?

10:27.400 --> 10:29.600
After a certain age, a person
likes to have a nice car.

10:36.600 --> 10:39.000
Artie, one of us needs
to be in charge.

10:39.100 --> 10:42.800
-Somebody has to run point.
-You.

10:42.900 --> 10:44.900
Good, then we're both
on the same page.

10:45.000 --> 10:45.600
Well, of course, Myka.

10:45.700 --> 10:46.800
I mean, you're the obvious choice.

10:47.600 --> 10:48.500
Just do me a favor, please.

10:48.600 --> 10:50.900
Let Pete think
that he's running things.

10:51.000 --> 10:52.500
He's very, very touchy.

10:53.400 --> 10:54.300
I can make that work.

10:54.600 --> 10:55.200
Good.

11:02.200 --> 11:04.900
So any news on the breach
at the warehouse?

11:05.000 --> 11:06.100
There's been no breach.

11:06.500 --> 11:08.900
Just a two-Bit hacker
who's going nowhere.

11:09.200 --> 11:11.800
Well, after the dead end at Dickinson’s,

11:12.000 --> 11:13.900
It looks like you're the one
that's getting nowhere.

11:14.000 --> 11:17.400
I, my dear, am choosing
to ignore this irritating pest.

11:17.800 --> 11:19.000
I suggest you do the same.

11:26.400 --> 11:29.300
There could be a probable explanation.

11:29.400 --> 11:30.900
High-Tension power lines.

11:31.000 --> 11:32.400
A nearby chemical spill.

11:32.500 --> 11:33.700
People just don't go crazy.

11:33.800 --> 11:34.400
Uh-Huh?

11:34.500 --> 11:38.300
Why don't you go to the
local county records office,

11:38.400 --> 11:39.900
See if you can
pull the geographics--

11:40.100 --> 11:41.600
-How about we just talk to folks

11:41.700 --> 11:43.400
And get a vibe for the town first?

11:44.100 --> 11:46.000
We need a plan, Pete.

11:46.100 --> 11:48.600
Something with a little more
logic and a little less kumbaya.

11:48.700 --> 11:50.900
Or we could just, you know, improvise.

12:01.000 --> 12:03.800
50 cents! Can you believe that?

12:07.700 --> 12:09.000
See what happens?

12:09.300 --> 12:10.700
Okay, now we have a plan.

12:11.600 --> 12:13.500
No, now we improvise.

12:13.600 --> 12:15.000
Some people, man, I mean,
always blaming the other guy.

12:15.100 --> 12:16.800
This patient weighed 300 pounds, you know?

12:16.900 --> 12:17.900
He smoked like a chimney.

12:18.200 --> 12:19.300
All he ate was butter.

12:19.500 --> 12:21.100
He was dead before
he got to us, you know?

12:21.200 --> 12:22.500
It's my fault he
had a heart attack?

12:22.600 --> 12:23.500
He was dead before
he got to us.

12:23.600 --> 12:26.100
Excuse me.
My husband, he died of--

12:26.600 --> 12:27.300
Oh, the hell with them.

12:27.400 --> 12:28.000
What do they know?

12:28.600 --> 12:30.800
-Would you mind, please?
-Lady, I’m on a break, okay?

12:30.900 --> 12:31.500
Do you mind?

12:31.600 --> 12:32.100
Who's that talking right there?

12:32.200 --> 12:32.800
I don't know.

12:32.900 --> 12:35.200
Some old lady looking for
free medical advice probably.

12:50.100 --> 12:51.700
-No, meg...
- Mm-Hmm?

12:51.900 --> 12:54.900
I don't think that it's your high
blood pressure Medicine that's causing this.

12:55.100 --> 12:56.600
I'm so embarrassed.

12:57.100 --> 12:58.700
My daughter will be furious.

12:59.000 --> 13:02.200
You know, it could be
a receptor Or channel blockers

13:02.300 --> 13:05.200
can cause dizziness Or
it could be a sugar imbalance.

13:05.300 --> 13:07.000
I noticed your diabetic pendant.

13:08.400 --> 13:09.100
You a doctor?

13:09.800 --> 13:12.200
No, I just know a lot.

13:13.400 --> 13:15.800
Well, her insulin levels are good.

13:15.900 --> 13:17.000
It's not her meds.

13:18.000 --> 13:20.400
Besides, meg's not the only one
to go off the deep end lately.

13:21.300 --> 13:21.900
Really?

13:23.200 --> 13:25.400
That's one crazy old lady in there, huh?

13:25.500 --> 13:26.200
Oh, no.

13:26.500 --> 13:28.100
Meg's an eighth-Grade English teacher.

13:29.400 --> 13:30.500
She's as sane as I am.

13:31.800 --> 13:32.600
Wait a minute.

13:33.000 --> 13:35.100
She spends all day with 13 year olds

13:35.200 --> 13:37.100
And one blue tool sends her over the edge?

13:37.200 --> 13:38.900
I guess everybody has their limit.

13:39.200 --> 13:42.700
Any similarities between her,
the flying nun, and that violinist kid?

13:44.100 --> 13:45.900
What did you say you were
doing in Unionville?

13:46.000 --> 13:48.500
Oh, my wife and I
are just passing through.

13:48.900 --> 13:50.800
You know, we're on our honeymoon, so.

13:50.900 --> 13:53.700
Anybody mention smelling fudge or--

13:55.200 --> 13:57.200
What exactly do you do
for a living, mister--

13:57.300 --> 13:58.400
Pete. I’m Pete.

13:58.900 --> 14:00.000
-And you're--
- Hey, Mac.

14:00.100 --> 14:00.700
Uh, Mac.

14:01.000 --> 14:02.700
Everybody around here just calls me Mac.

14:02.800 --> 14:04.000
We got another situation.

14:05.200 --> 14:06.000
What's up, Sal?

14:06.200 --> 14:08.600
Tommy Wilson was caught trying
to set the music room on fire.

14:08.700 --> 14:09.700
Principal wants you to come down.

14:10.100 --> 14:11.500
On my way, Sal.

14:11.800 --> 14:12.800
Have a nice honeymoon.

14:17.000 --> 14:18.400
Honeymoon? Why would you say that?

14:19.700 --> 14:20.600
I wanted a cover.

14:20.900 --> 14:22.600
I don't want to say
who we are just yet.

14:22.700 --> 14:24.000
You know, we stay on the down low,

14:24.400 --> 14:25.600
We operate more freely.

14:26.000 --> 14:29.800
Okay, you just can't run around town
saying whatever comes into your head.

14:30.100 --> 14:31.300
We have to stay under the radar.

14:31.400 --> 14:32.300
Remember stealth?

14:32.400 --> 14:34.900
Covers are, like,
the definition of stealth.

14:35.000 --> 14:36.800
Plus, I’m very good at them.

14:37.500 --> 14:40.200
You're ten years old.
You are ten years old.

14:40.300 --> 14:42.000
You know, I’m gonna
go interview the nun.

14:42.800 --> 14:43.400
Fine.

14:43.700 --> 14:45.600
Sounds like the violinist kid is getting worse,

14:45.700 --> 14:46.900
So I’m gonna go check that out.

14:47.000 --> 14:48.400
That's all right with you, sarge?

14:48.800 --> 14:51.300
- You're eight years old.
- Eh.

14:53.500 --> 14:54.800
I knew I could fly.

14:56.400 --> 14:57.500
I just knew it.

14:58.200 --> 15:00.000
Where were you before you, um...

15:01.500 --> 15:02.300
Jumped?

15:02.700 --> 15:04.000
I had just left the center.

15:04.100 --> 15:06.900
Sister grace works most days
at a battered women's shelter.

15:07.800 --> 15:11.000
Have you received any
jewelry of any kind recently?

15:11.100 --> 15:13.100
Any gifts?
Anything new?

15:13.300 --> 15:14.200
We are nuns.

15:14.600 --> 15:16.500
We renounce worldly possessions.

15:16.600 --> 15:18.000
Of course. Right.

15:19.300 --> 15:22.300
Did you know Tommy Wilson or meg...riley?

15:22.600 --> 15:23.600
Not really.

15:24.100 --> 15:25.000
Is Tommy all right?

15:25.200 --> 15:27.000
Yes, I just thought maybe--

15:27.100 --> 15:27.900
I can fly.

15:30.000 --> 15:30.900
I can.

15:34.300 --> 15:36.400
Uh, can I talk to you
outside for a second?

15:36.500 --> 15:37.300
Will you excuse us?

15:42.000 --> 15:44.300
Hey, Mac, sorry to bother you,

15:44.400 --> 15:46.400
But can I ask you a few
questions about the Wilson kid?

15:46.800 --> 15:48.700
Strange way to spend your
honeymoon there, Pete.

15:49.400 --> 15:51.700
Lattimer. Agent Pete Lattimer.

15:52.400 --> 15:53.500
Secret service.

15:54.500 --> 15:55.200
Secret service?

15:55.300 --> 15:58.600
Hope you're not flashing that badge
all over town and scaring folks.

15:58.700 --> 15:59.900
No one's trying to scare anybody.

16:00.100 --> 16:01.500
I've got enough problems around here lately

16:01.600 --> 16:03.700
Without people thinking this
is some kind of terrorist plot.

16:04.700 --> 16:05.600
there's no plot.

16:05.800 --> 16:07.800
Look, Mac, you just let me do my job.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.500
-No one will be hurt. I’ll be on--
- No, sir,

16:09.800 --> 16:12.300
not if your job is
sneaking around lying to folks.

16:12.800 --> 16:14.100
I don't trust people
who lie to me.

16:15.100 --> 16:17.100
I just need to ask Tommy
a few questions.

16:17.800 --> 16:20.800
Tommy Wilson slipped into
a coma about an hour ago.

16:21.700 --> 16:23.700
Now can the secret service explain that?

16:24.500 --> 16:26.000
Because the doctors sure as hell can't.

16:32.600 --> 16:37.000
I noticed that sister grace was wearing one of those
rubber bracelets for domestic violence awareness.

16:37.100 --> 16:39.300
Yes, she came to us about a year ago.

16:39.600 --> 16:42.800
I can't go into details,
but there was a fair amount of abuse.

16:42.900 --> 16:43.700
I'm sorry.

16:44.100 --> 16:45.900
Has she been depressed lately?

16:46.000 --> 16:49.100
I mean, I’m assuming this
incident is new behavior.

16:49.200 --> 16:51.400
Well, she hasn't jumped off
any other buildings,

16:51.700 --> 16:52.600
If that's what you mean.

16:52.700 --> 16:54.700
Of course not.
It's just--

16:54.800 --> 16:57.700
I'd really like her to get some
rest If that's all right with you.

16:57.800 --> 16:58.500
Right. Sure.

16:58.800 --> 17:00.100
Thank you, father.

17:02.000 --> 17:02.700
Sister Grace?

17:04.800 --> 17:05.700
Oh, my God!

17:23.599 --> 17:24.800
Sister Grace!

17:26.200 --> 17:26.800
The wind.

17:26.900 --> 17:27.900
Sister!

17:28.900 --> 17:30.500
Stay there, sister.
I'm coming up.

17:33.000 --> 17:33.900
Sister!

17:34.400 --> 17:35.300
I can fly.

17:35.700 --> 17:37.300
You cannot fly!

17:39.500 --> 17:40.700
Grace Ellen!

17:51.900 --> 17:54.500
So wait, the snow bank saved her life?

17:54.600 --> 17:56.200
- Yeah, I mean,
sister grace is alive,

17:56.300 --> 17:58.100
But she's all busted up from the fall.

17:58.300 --> 17:59.600
Should put the snow bank in a warehouse.

17:59.700 --> 18:01.100
Okay, it sounds
like it's intensifying.

18:01.200 --> 18:02.000
Is Tommy still in a coma?

18:02.100 --> 18:03.400
Yeah, yeah. I was just over there.

18:03.500 --> 18:06.500
The doctor said he just kind of shutdown.

18:06.800 --> 18:09.600
Okay, well that sounds like
it's causing some kind of regression.

18:09.700 --> 18:11.800
You got to find this thing fast
before it gets worse.

18:11.900 --> 18:12.500
You got that?

18:15.300 --> 18:16.700
Uh...yeah.

18:17.100 --> 18:18.300
Have you ever seen anything like this?

18:18.400 --> 18:23.500
Well, actually, once there was this Little bell
and what it did was it made people laugh.

18:23.700 --> 18:26.000
Oh, well that doesn't sound
very dangerous.

18:26.100 --> 18:26.700
Oh, yeah?

18:26.800 --> 18:29.300
Well, the victims would
ultimately Laugh themselves to death.

18:29.800 --> 18:32.100
Cardiac arrest due to asphyxiation.

18:32.200 --> 18:32.900
Freaky.

18:33.000 --> 18:34.700
So what you're saying
is there's always a link?

18:34.800 --> 18:35.500
Always.

18:35.800 --> 18:39.400
And you just keep looking under rocks
And I’ll do what I can from here, okay?

18:43.700 --> 18:44.700
Book on tape.

18:48.800 --> 18:50.600
It's always mind control.

18:59.100 --> 18:59.800
Hey!

19:00.800 --> 19:01.800
I have work to do.

19:29.500 --> 19:30.200
Okay.

19:34.500 --> 19:35.100
Okay.

19:36.700 --> 19:37.500
That's that.

19:51.800 --> 19:52.900
Now cut that out.

20:00.149 --> 20:00.989
Thanks.

20:01.192 --> 20:02.626
You didn't get that from me.

20:03.471 --> 20:04.810
I'm running a business here.

20:06.990 --> 20:07.912
- hey.
- hey.

20:08.160 --> 20:09.438
So nothing connects.

20:09.438 --> 20:10.828
Tommy never had meg
As a teacher.

20:10.828 --> 20:12.128
Meg doesn't know sister grace.

20:12.128 --> 20:13.701
And sister grace
Taught Sunday school,

20:13.701 --> 20:14.825
But Tommy never took it.

20:14.825 --> 20:17.947
So they're all doing things
Completely out of character?

20:18.053 --> 20:22.117
So if someone does something totally opposite
From what they normally do--

20:22.549 --> 20:23.694
Drugs.

20:24.470 --> 20:27.729
Although the old lady and the nun
Don't strike me as crackheads.

20:27.729 --> 20:29.325
Not so much. Hey.

20:29.468 --> 20:31.021
I thought the medic
Might know something,

20:31.021 --> 20:32.667
So I asked him
To meet me after work.

20:32.667 --> 20:34.438
Good idea.
I got a thing to do.

20:34.438 --> 20:35.725
But, Myka,
I want you to be careful.

20:35.725 --> 20:37.096
I want you to use
A condom.

20:38.260 --> 20:39.300
That's hilarious.

20:48.307 --> 20:50.103
- thanks for taking the time.
- oh, no worries.

20:50.124 --> 20:51.598
Wife's taking care
Of the twins, so.

20:51.598 --> 20:54.891
- oh, um, congratulations.
- six months.

20:55.179 --> 20:56.723
They say it gets easier.

20:58.245 --> 20:59.060
Do you want to sit down?

20:59.060 --> 21:00.610
Uh, yeah, sure.

21:02.336 --> 21:05.277
Sorry I’m late, by the way.
It's just such a weird day.

21:05.277 --> 21:06.530
Did something else happen?

21:06.530 --> 21:08.580
Do you remember meg
From the coffee shop?

21:08.580 --> 21:10.960
Let me guess.
She went a little crazier, right?

21:11.281 --> 21:12.173
Yeah.

21:12.447 --> 21:14.703
Middle of a planning meeting
For a children's carnival,

21:14.703 --> 21:16.275
She threw a lamp
At father braid.

21:16.275 --> 21:17.651
- was he hurt?
- he's all right.

21:17.651 --> 21:18.803
I was just at his office.

21:18.803 --> 21:20.959
A couple of stitches
And she broke her wrist.

21:20.959 --> 21:23.546
But the weird thing
Is they're really good friends.

21:23.546 --> 21:25.747
Father braid helped her through
The loss of her husband last year.

21:25.747 --> 21:28.592
Did he die at the hospital
Where meg threw the urn?

21:28.592 --> 21:30.443
It was in the emergency room.
He had a heart attack.

21:38.518 --> 21:40.268
Okay, so...

21:44.893 --> 21:45.542
Hey.

21:46.554 --> 21:47.772
Hey, I’m up here.

22:07.066 --> 22:07.999
I'm Dave.

22:08.233 --> 22:10.283
Haven't seen you
Around before. You new?

22:10.816 --> 22:12.413
Eight years actually.

22:12.420 --> 22:14.102
I'm just passing through town.

22:14.102 --> 22:15.258
I'm Pete.

22:16.199 --> 22:18.560
Welcome, Pete.
It's a great meeting.

22:18.795 --> 22:20.605
Good.
I could use one tonight.

22:20.762 --> 22:23.430
All right, meeting time.
Take a seat if you can, please.

22:23.430 --> 22:26.492
Welcome to the Saturday night
Solutions meeting.

22:26.984 --> 22:28.155
My name is Ellis.

22:28.397 --> 22:29.758
I'm an alcoholic.

22:29.758 --> 22:31.017
Ellis.

22:31.097 --> 22:32.725
And I’ll be your leader
For tonight.

22:37.189 --> 22:39.340
Can you think of anything
These people have in common?

22:39.340 --> 22:40.177
I can't.

22:40.177 --> 22:42.065
Meg isn't even
From Unionville.

22:42.065 --> 22:43.033
She's from Colton.

22:43.598 --> 22:44.645
That could be important.

22:45.167 --> 22:46.273
How far is, um--

22:46.273 --> 22:47.825
Can I just touch these?

22:47.910 --> 22:49.303
- hey!
- Ross!

22:49.303 --> 22:50.576
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!

22:50.576 --> 22:51.557
I don't even know
Why I’d do that!

22:51.557 --> 22:52.724
I've never done anything
Like that before.

22:52.724 --> 22:54.265
I'm married. I told you, right?
I have twins. I told you that.

22:54.265 --> 22:55.036
Wait a second.

22:56.498 --> 22:58.664
Just wait a second.

22:59.060 --> 23:00.101
Can I just touch this one?

23:02.090 --> 23:03.701
Okay, I think I know
What's going on here.

23:03.701 --> 23:05.550
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. That hurts.

23:05.550 --> 23:06.995
I don't know
Why I keep doing that.

23:06.995 --> 23:07.994
I believe you.

23:07.994 --> 23:09.847
I just rather you didn't
Do it again, okay?

23:11.363 --> 23:12.613
Ross, you lost your balance.

23:12.613 --> 23:13.541
What?

23:14.388 --> 23:16.902
Right before you just--
You lost your balance.

23:16.902 --> 23:19.535
So did meg before she threw
That guy through the glass

23:19.535 --> 23:21.125
And Tommy in the video.

23:21.125 --> 23:22.422
What are you saying?

23:23.389 --> 23:24.208
You've got it.

23:25.016 --> 23:27.786
Whatever this is,
You've been affected too.

23:29.784 --> 23:32.591
And if not for this program
Taking it one day at a time,

23:32.591 --> 23:35.159
I'd have been dead
22 years ago.

23:35.256 --> 23:38.375
But I was willing to do anything
To keep from taking that next drink.

23:38.697 --> 23:39.349
Anything.

23:39.947 --> 23:41.388
So if you...

23:48.505 --> 23:49.359
Dave. You're all right?

23:50.239 --> 23:50.970
Dave?

23:56.685 --> 23:58.014
- thank you for this.
- no problem.

23:58.014 --> 24:00.614
Okay, so we know that you've
Been in contact with meg.

24:00.614 --> 24:03.158
What about sister grace
Or Tommy Wilson?

24:03.158 --> 24:04.715
No, I don't even know Tommy

24:04.715 --> 24:07.629
And I’ve only seen the sister at church.

24:13.304 --> 24:14.893
Hey, Dave,
What are you doing here?

24:17.880 --> 24:19.209
- Pete?
- hang on Myka.

24:20.502 --> 24:21.430
Thanks, Pete.

24:21.477 --> 24:22.706
Yeah, it's all right, man.

24:25.289 --> 24:25.991
Dave, cut it out!

24:25.991 --> 24:27.903
Hey, hey, hey.
No, no, no, no.

24:28.421 --> 24:29.538
Dave, what are you doing?

24:29.538 --> 24:31.157
Yeah, you got over
20 years, man.

24:31.157 --> 24:32.964
What's up?
Did something happen to you?

24:33.274 --> 24:34.355
Why?
Who are you?

24:34.441 --> 24:35.339
This is Pete.

24:36.307 --> 24:38.460
Pete, this is Ellis Hayes,
My therapist.

24:39.943 --> 24:41.528
Oh, for crying out loud.

24:43.232 --> 24:44.494
Okay, I’m sorry.
I won't do it again.

24:44.494 --> 24:45.599
I won't touch
Your breasts anymore.

24:45.599 --> 24:46.434
What are you doing?

24:46.760 --> 24:48.197
We talked about this.

24:48.197 --> 24:49.426
Wait, you talked to Ross?

24:49.426 --> 24:49.926
Wait a minute.

24:49.926 --> 24:53.574
Do you treat an old lady named meg
And a teenage violinist?

24:53.574 --> 24:55.594
I can't discuss
My patients with you.

24:58.818 --> 25:00.882
We got a lot of questions
For you, pal.

25:01.192 --> 25:02.949
Dave.
Dave! Dave!

25:03.766 --> 25:04.811
Hurry and uncuff me.

25:09.585 --> 25:11.012
We need to get him
To a hospital right away.

25:11.012 --> 25:12.133
Call 911.

25:18.289 --> 25:20.087
Okay, so what,
Dave is in a coma too?

25:20.087 --> 25:21.871
Yeah, he collapsed right
In front of us.

25:21.871 --> 25:23.939
The doctors are bringing
In some specialist.

25:23.939 --> 25:25.850
Well, I doubt that specialist
Is gonna be any help.

25:25.850 --> 25:28.509
I mean, I think this thing ultimately
Shuts down the central nervous system.

25:28.509 --> 25:31.533
I'm worried it's gonna go further
And shutdown the body entirely.

25:31.533 --> 25:33.525
- what about that therapist?
- I’m going to see him now.

25:33.525 --> 25:34.827
And I’m gonna
Go see father braid.

25:34.827 --> 25:37.793
See if I can get some details about
When sister grace went into therapy.

25:37.793 --> 25:39.368
Maybe it's time related.

25:39.368 --> 25:40.564
Time?
No, no, no, no, no, no.

25:40.564 --> 25:42.432
No, the pattern
Of behavior here

25:42.432 --> 25:46.533
Is the result of individual contact
With the same artifact.

25:46.533 --> 25:48.932
It was something they found.

25:48.932 --> 25:50.990
They might have seen it.
Probably, they touched it.

25:50.990 --> 25:52.418
What am I looking for?

25:52.418 --> 25:55.248
Anything that might cause an electrical
Or chemical imbalance in the brain.

25:55.650 --> 25:58.131
Oh, well,
So a brain imbalancer.

25:58.131 --> 25:58.907
That's easy.

25:58.907 --> 26:01.144
It's probably right next
To his time-travel machine.

26:01.144 --> 26:02.907
No.
Trust yourselves.

26:02.907 --> 26:03.934
You're gonna know
It when you see it.

26:03.934 --> 26:04.922
That's why we chose you.

26:04.922 --> 26:07.122
Instinct and observation.
You're a great team.

26:07.666 --> 26:10.218
What--what is that?
Where are you?

26:10.218 --> 26:13.046
We are at
An ice skating rink.

26:13.046 --> 26:15.893
- feel better there, twinkle toes?
- I like skating

26:15.893 --> 26:17.701
And it
Helps me think, Artie.

26:17.701 --> 26:19.430
I have nothing but faith.

26:21.808 --> 26:22.989
Nothing but faith.

26:26.766 --> 26:28.098
For crying out loud.

26:28.454 --> 26:29.634
Who designed this?

26:29.914 --> 26:33.327
Thomas Edison, Nicola Tesla,
And M.C. Escher.

26:33.327 --> 26:34.343
What are you doing here?

26:34.343 --> 26:36.289
Thought you might need me.
Do you?

26:36.345 --> 26:37.854
Please.
It's no big deal.

26:37.854 --> 26:40.278
I'm just trying to track down
An electrical short or an anomaly.

26:41.282 --> 26:42.260
I tracked it down.

26:52.404 --> 26:54.145
I'll take that as a yes.

26:56.305 --> 26:58.163
I don't care
If you're James Bond.

26:58.721 --> 27:00.891
What a therapist discusses
With his patients

27:00.891 --> 27:02.519
Is completely privileged.

27:03.019 --> 27:04.530
Well, not under
The patriot act.

27:04.530 --> 27:06.358
I have no intention of--

27:11.021 --> 27:13.830
Look, Ellis,
People are being hurt.

27:14.046 --> 27:15.607
Believe me,
You want to help me

27:15.607 --> 27:17.345
Or you're not gonna
Have any patients left.

27:19.883 --> 27:21.055
What's this?

27:23.530 --> 27:25.716
Don't touch that,
Please.

27:26.613 --> 27:27.566
I just acquired it.

27:27.756 --> 27:29.564
- really?
- don't pick it up.

27:29.663 --> 27:31.005
It's an antique.

27:31.298 --> 27:34.294
Belonged to Joseph Dunninger,
The famous mentalist.

27:34.294 --> 27:35.549
Are you kidding me, man?

27:35.736 --> 27:39.249
What, you didn't think that this
Was worth mentioning?

27:39.249 --> 27:40.463
I collect pocket watches.

27:40.463 --> 27:42.746
There's nothing in the patriot
Act about that, is there?

27:42.746 --> 27:45.000
- I have to take this with me.
- you what?

27:45.000 --> 27:46.572
Don't snap your pencil.

27:46.572 --> 27:49.569
I'll get it back to you...
Probably.

27:49.923 --> 27:53.366
Sheriff McKenna was just here
And I told him the same thing.

27:53.538 --> 27:56.380
Sister grace has never been
To see Ellis Hayes.

27:57.642 --> 27:58.828
Well, how can you
Be sure?

27:58.828 --> 28:01.330
'Cause I suggested it
And she refused.

28:01.740 --> 28:03.330
She was mortified
By the idea.

28:03.341 --> 28:05.165
I happen to believe
In therapy.

28:05.165 --> 28:06.815
I suggested it
To meg as well.

28:06.876 --> 28:07.829
Anger issues?

28:07.829 --> 28:12.683
When Ben died,
She felt betrayed by doctors, by god.

28:12.937 --> 28:14.289
It's quite common for--

28:14.289 --> 28:15.931
I know how she feels.

28:16.912 --> 28:18.698
Since I lost Sam...

28:20.061 --> 28:22.183
The men in my life drive me...

28:23.950 --> 28:27.152
Even before my dad--

28:27.152 --> 28:28.692
Yes, well,
To get back to meg.

28:28.692 --> 28:31.348
I suppose she's
Been more angry with--

28:31.348 --> 28:31.990
Men.

28:32.128 --> 28:34.623
Angry at men.

28:35.024 --> 28:35.965
Agent Bering?

28:36.548 --> 28:40.944
My boss, my colleagues,
My partner, my father,

28:40.944 --> 28:43.449
They're everywhere,
Suffocating.

28:43.482 --> 28:44.394
Agent Bering?

28:47.901 --> 28:48.847
Are you all right?

28:49.165 --> 28:49.972
Myka?

28:54.605 --> 28:56.101
Thank you so much.

28:56.210 --> 28:58.508
I'll--I’ll just show
Myself out.

29:02.562 --> 29:04.239
Ellis just called me.
He's very upset.

29:04.239 --> 29:06.715
Now I want to know just what
The hell you two are up to.

29:07.771 --> 29:09.586
I got people to protect
In this town.

29:10.369 --> 29:12.561
You think you can
Just walk all over me?

29:12.772 --> 29:15.665
Dude, you're taking this kind
Of personal, don't you think?

29:15.665 --> 29:17.121
Secret service?

29:17.121 --> 29:19.033
Anybody could buy a badge
On the internet.

29:19.119 --> 29:21.249
I don't know what
You two got planned.

29:21.249 --> 29:24.106
But I will do
Whatever I have to

29:24.106 --> 29:25.921
To protect my country.

29:27.512 --> 29:28.792
Chew on that.

29:35.701 --> 29:36.982
Oh, hey.

29:36.982 --> 29:38.846
And where have you been?

29:38.846 --> 29:40.680
- no, I was--
- I’ve been here for half an hour.

29:40.680 --> 29:43.552
Oh, and the sheriff
Is a little spooky, fyi.

29:43.552 --> 29:47.757
But don't worry,
Because I found it.

29:51.362 --> 29:53.246
Joseph Dunninger's watch.

29:53.246 --> 29:55.694
He's a famous mentalist,
In case you didn't know.

29:55.694 --> 29:59.112
So score one for the Pete-dog.
Swish! Ah!

30:00.238 --> 30:02.121
Don't worry.
You're still in charge.

30:02.121 --> 30:04.693
I mean, look, we can't all
Be heroes all the time.

30:04.693 --> 30:06.767
- your chance to be a hero--
- you're an ass.

30:10.721 --> 30:12.475
Myka, geez Louise.
Ow!

30:13.706 --> 30:15.508
Okay, little girl,
Fun's over.

30:19.838 --> 30:22.728
Myka, I think
You got it.

30:24.508 --> 30:25.697
You infected it.

30:28.970 --> 30:31.213
Thanks for bailing me out,
But this is ridiculous.

30:31.213 --> 30:32.764
I've been exposed
To the artifact.

30:33.905 --> 30:34.952
What am I supposed to do,

30:34.952 --> 30:37.407
Let you sit in jail
And quietly slip into a coma?

30:37.407 --> 30:40.594
I could get really dangerous,
Pete, to you.

30:41.525 --> 30:42.535
You know,
I'm going back inside.

30:42.535 --> 30:43.639
Wait, wait, wait.
Myka, look.

30:43.639 --> 30:45.385
No, you look.
You have a job to do.

30:45.652 --> 30:48.596
How can you trust me if you know
That I could turn on you at any minute?

30:48.596 --> 30:49.840
Because I do,
Okay?

30:50.102 --> 30:50.854
I just do.

30:50.854 --> 30:52.748
You're gonna have to do more
Than take a swing at me.

30:52.748 --> 30:56.332
Besides, how you gonna
Be in charge if you're in jail, huh?

30:56.707 --> 30:58.199
Who's gonna tell me
What to do?

31:02.631 --> 31:03.343
Hey, Artie.

31:03.629 --> 31:05.769
Artie, I’ve got it.
I've been exposed.

31:05.927 --> 31:06.866
Are you sure?

31:06.970 --> 31:08.064
Oh, yeah.
We're sure.

31:08.650 --> 31:12.252
Okay. Well, it's just that much
More important to find this artifact fast.

31:12.252 --> 31:12.872
Hey, Artie, look.

31:12.872 --> 31:14.918
So there's no way
It could be the watch, right?

31:14.918 --> 31:16.366
I mean, maybe the,
You know--

31:16.366 --> 31:19.089
The anti-magnetic
Bag thing didn't work.

31:19.089 --> 31:21.484
It is not the watch.
Myka didn't touch the watch.

31:21.484 --> 31:23.368
And sister grace
Wasn't even a patient.

31:23.368 --> 31:24.847
I told him
It wasn't the watch.

31:24.847 --> 31:27.714
- I told you it wasn't the watch.
- that's not annoying at all.

31:27.714 --> 31:29.310
Look, look, guys.
You're doing great.

31:29.310 --> 31:32.133
You just have to both go out
There and keep looking.

31:32.133 --> 31:34.554
Artie, I’ve been exposed.
I have to stay locked up.

31:34.554 --> 31:35.648
Yeah, I told her
I can handle it.

31:35.648 --> 31:37.244
Please, like you
Handled the bar?

31:38.923 --> 31:41.225
Get it together.
People are in hospitals.

31:41.528 --> 31:44.198
It's only a question of time
Before somebody dies

31:44.198 --> 31:47.099
From this thing that you
Have not found yet.

31:47.628 --> 31:49.067
- all right.
- okay.

31:54.308 --> 31:56.173
You know, he's trying
To find the location

31:56.173 --> 31:59.292
Of this warehouse by probing
The electrical grid.

31:59.992 --> 32:01.019
Look at that.

32:01.451 --> 32:02.732
Not a bad notion.

32:03.501 --> 32:04.591
This guy's a thinker.

32:05.269 --> 32:07.089
And what,
We're just sitting ducks?

32:07.089 --> 32:08.510
No, no, no, no.
Look at that.

32:08.510 --> 32:09.926
It's completely unfocused.

32:09.926 --> 32:12.096
He's got no actual
Control of anything.

32:12.096 --> 32:14.969
He's just causing trouble.

32:15.136 --> 32:17.172
Well, he seems to be doing
A good job of that.

32:21.052 --> 32:21.862
Yeah.

32:25.348 --> 32:27.462
Okay, so maybe there's
Something going on

32:27.462 --> 32:29.676
- before it affects you.
- Pete, I insist that you handcuff me.

32:29.676 --> 32:31.186
Make sure that
I can't hurt you.

32:31.186 --> 32:32.923
Look, Myka,
Let's find the artifact--

32:32.923 --> 32:35.718
I need you
To disarm the danger first.

32:38.374 --> 32:40.418
Listen to me for once!

32:41.228 --> 32:42.015
No, you don't!

32:42.819 --> 32:44.540
Okay, all right.
All right.

32:44.627 --> 32:45.270
Sorry about that.

32:45.270 --> 32:47.335
No, no, no, no, no, no.
No worries.

32:47.336 --> 32:48.405
It's my fault.

32:48.405 --> 32:49.839
I kind of did that
On purpose.

32:50.437 --> 32:52.111
I mean, what were you
Thinking just then?

32:52.111 --> 32:53.270
- what were you feeling?
- nothing.

32:54.606 --> 32:57.187
Okay, I was kind of thinking
That you were an infantile chimp.

32:57.187 --> 32:58.368
- I’m sorry.
- no, no, okay.

32:58.368 --> 32:58.749
That's good.

32:58.749 --> 33:01.537
So obviously it affects
Your subconscious.

33:01.718 --> 33:04.360
Subconscious?
Subconscious desires.

33:04.360 --> 33:05.380
Pete, that's it.

33:05.380 --> 33:09.576
Meg wants revenge.
Sister grace wants to escape.

33:09.576 --> 33:12.603
Ross--I bet that Ross’s wife is
Still breast-feeding.

33:12.603 --> 33:15.080
And Tommy secretly
Hates the violin.

33:15.080 --> 33:18.154
And you subconsciously want
To punch me every five minutes.

33:18.154 --> 33:19.252
Okay, sometimes.

33:19.252 --> 33:20.539
But why me and not you?

33:20.539 --> 33:22.878
And why hasn't
The whole town gone nuts?

33:22.878 --> 33:24.346
Okay, well,
Let's just retrace our steps.

33:24.346 --> 33:25.371
Where have you gone
That I haven't?

33:25.371 --> 33:26.903
- okay, we were at the...
- coffee shop.

33:26.903 --> 33:29.311
- and at the bar, right?
- I was at the jail,

33:29.311 --> 33:31.959
But nobody else
There was affected, so I don't--

33:31.959 --> 33:32.673
Myka.

33:34.994 --> 33:36.081
That's Ross.

33:37.361 --> 33:39.509
- that's meg.
- you've been in that church.

33:39.509 --> 33:40.484
Twice. You?

33:40.484 --> 33:41.703
No.

33:47.312 --> 33:48.747
Father,
It's in the church.

33:49.089 --> 33:49.866
What's in the church?

33:49.866 --> 33:52.221
Tommy Wilson, meg,
Dave, Ross,

33:52.221 --> 33:54.188
They're all members
Of your congregation, right?

33:54.188 --> 33:55.145
What do they
Have in common?

33:55.145 --> 33:56.614
Are they on some
Committee together?

33:56.614 --> 33:58.881
No, they're not even--
Well, wait.

33:58.970 --> 34:00.821
I've seen each of them recently.
They've each been in here.

34:00.821 --> 34:02.616
Wait, wait. Here?
Here in this office?

34:02.616 --> 34:04.842
Here.
It's in here.

34:04.842 --> 34:07.064
Of course it is.
I've been in here too.

34:07.064 --> 34:08.292
Pete, you should
Get out of here.

34:08.292 --> 34:09.534
You have to get
Out of here now.

34:09.534 --> 34:10.848
- it can't be that simple.
- why?

34:10.848 --> 34:11.987
Father braid
Isn't affected.

34:12.187 --> 34:13.904
Father, where do you
Talk to them?

34:13.904 --> 34:14.652
Where are you sitting?

34:14.728 --> 34:15.762
In that chair.

34:16.697 --> 34:18.760
And I sat...

34:22.543 --> 34:23.620
- that's it.
- it's the chair.

34:23.620 --> 34:25.092
Father, where did you
Get this chair?

34:25.193 --> 34:27.359
I inherited it from
My great-great-great-great--

34:27.359 --> 34:28.702
- got it. Pete?
- I’m on it.

34:28.702 --> 34:30.400
Okay, how long have you
Had the chair?

34:30.400 --> 34:31.860
About a week or so.
What is that thing?

34:31.860 --> 34:33.998
Uh, it's a--we--
It--it--

34:33.998 --> 34:34.858
Never mind. Pete?

34:34.858 --> 34:36.070
Father, father,
What's his name,

34:36.070 --> 34:38.005
The original owner,
Your great-great-great-great--

34:38.005 --> 34:39.670
James braid.
He was a doctor.

34:39.670 --> 34:41.821
Did he--wait.
Did he say "James Braid"?

34:41.821 --> 34:42.708
Yes.

34:45.775 --> 34:47.141
He's the father
Of hypnotherapy.

34:47.141 --> 34:49.212
Artie, that's it!
Father braid has his chair.

34:49.212 --> 34:50.417
That's got to be it,
Right?

34:50.417 --> 34:51.042
Hang on, hang on.

34:51.826 --> 34:52.822
He's a direct descendent.

34:52.822 --> 34:55.408
If he's got the same DNA,
Same vocal patterns--

34:55.408 --> 34:57.235
It's the iron springs.

34:57.235 --> 34:58.296
The springs in the chair?

34:58.296 --> 35:01.729
If they've become Ferro magnetized,
Like silverware can.

35:01.729 --> 35:04.233
- screwdrivers.
- years of powerful hypnotherapy

35:04.233 --> 35:07.084
- and brain waves--
- all those patients sat...

35:07.781 --> 35:08.996
In this chair.

35:09.671 --> 35:12.067
And those springs began
To work on their own.

35:12.067 --> 35:13.976
Releasing their
Subconscious desires.

35:13.976 --> 35:16.824
- combined with the sound of his voice.
- like a tuning fork.

35:16.824 --> 35:18.826
Are you saying this chair
Caused all this?

35:18.826 --> 35:19.647
I know.
It's freaky.

35:19.647 --> 35:21.166
This stuff is always freaky.

35:21.166 --> 35:22.681
Artie, how do we
Reverse this?

35:22.681 --> 35:24.694
You know, you could try
Dousing the chair.

35:26.384 --> 35:28.434
Pete! Myka!
What's going on?

35:28.434 --> 35:29.425
Talk to me, what--

35:36.961 --> 35:37.810
Mac!

35:38.843 --> 35:39.543
There you are.

35:39.543 --> 35:40.875
Just who I was looking for.

35:40.875 --> 35:43.046
Sheriff, put the gun down.

35:43.046 --> 35:44.052
It's a virus!

35:44.052 --> 35:46.662
You planted a virus
In my town

35:46.662 --> 35:48.279
And I’ve got
To contain it!

35:54.251 --> 35:55.381
Okay, okay, father.

35:55.381 --> 35:57.000
Are you hit anywhere else?

35:57.000 --> 35:58.938
Oh, it's my shoulder.
It hurts.

35:59.233 --> 36:02.100
So I take it sheriff McKenna
Sat in that chair recently?

36:02.100 --> 36:03.372
- yesterday.
- great.

36:04.089 --> 36:04.573
Here.

36:04.914 --> 36:06.678
- father, let me see that.
- oh, Ross.

36:07.066 --> 36:08.275
Where are Susan
And the twins?

36:08.275 --> 36:09.756
No, no, no, it's okay.
They're outside.

36:09.756 --> 36:11.068
The canister of goo
Is in the trunk.

36:11.068 --> 36:11.710
Let me see. Let me see.

36:12.776 --> 36:13.850
I'll take care of the father.

36:16.072 --> 36:19.107
I'm gonna clean up this town!
You understand me?

36:27.895 --> 36:29.493
Get him outside right now.

36:29.493 --> 36:31.893
And get everyone as far away
From here as possible.

36:35.598 --> 36:37.276
Do you think the Tesla
Would ignite that bomb?

36:37.276 --> 36:39.148
Let's test that theory another
Day, shall we?

36:39.148 --> 36:40.195
Then go douse the chair.

36:40.195 --> 36:41.371
I'll take care
Of captain America.

36:41.371 --> 36:43.867
No, no, he hates you.
You go douse the chair.

36:43.867 --> 36:46.551
For once, would you just
Let me call it?

36:46.551 --> 36:49.039
It would be better
If you weren't here, Pete.

36:49.039 --> 36:51.557
Why do you always have
To be so bossy?

36:53.053 --> 36:55.963
- I’m sorry.
- would you stop doing that?

36:56.551 --> 36:58.681
Just stop
Pissing me off then.

36:58.681 --> 36:59.390
Fine. Fine.

36:59.390 --> 37:01.714
Come on out and I’ll
Let these people go.

37:03.357 --> 37:04.014
Okay.

37:06.860 --> 37:07.462
Watch out!

37:08.623 --> 37:10.084
- sorry, sorry.
- okay.

37:10.084 --> 37:12.696
You know, if you were gonna
Ask me how I would die,

37:12.696 --> 37:14.962
I would say that
Being beaten to death

37:14.962 --> 37:17.741
By my partner would
Be really low on the list.

37:17.741 --> 37:19.678
- you just go do the chair.
- I’m gonna go do the chair.

37:19.678 --> 37:20.169
Okay.

37:23.078 --> 37:23.973
Stay down!

37:26.871 --> 37:28.262
Don't do this, Mac!

37:28.899 --> 37:31.151
Try and focus!
This isn't you!

37:31.151 --> 37:33.841
Some must die
So others will live!

37:33.841 --> 37:35.997
You don't want
To hurt these people, Mac.

37:37.592 --> 37:40.882
I know what you're feeling.
Just try and fight it.

37:54.985 --> 37:58.949
I will not let this evil spread
To the rest of the country!

37:59.516 --> 38:00.775
It ends here!

38:00.900 --> 38:02.583
There is no danger!

38:03.282 --> 38:04.246
Mac...

38:05.913 --> 38:06.707
Listen to me.

38:06.707 --> 38:07.954
Look around you.

38:08.718 --> 38:11.345
You know these people,
Right?

38:12.770 --> 38:14.207
They're your friends!

38:29.632 --> 38:31.959
Hey, I doused the chair!
It's over!

38:37.810 --> 38:39.241
Okay, I’ll be right back.

38:41.221 --> 38:42.538
It's a trick.
You're trying to trick me.

38:42.538 --> 38:46.257
It's not a trick, Mac.
I'm on your side.

38:46.700 --> 38:48.829
Listen to me, Mac, okay?
I'm trying to help you.

38:49.117 --> 38:52.172
If you want me to trust you,
Then show yourself.

38:54.364 --> 38:55.700
Show yourself!

39:03.573 --> 39:04.644
Take me.

39:06.089 --> 39:08.190
Mac, I’m the one you want.

39:08.950 --> 39:10.024
Not them.

39:10.280 --> 39:12.757
There's probably dozens
Of you in town by now.

39:13.786 --> 39:14.572
Hundreds.

39:15.097 --> 39:16.315
No, it's just me.

39:16.754 --> 39:18.344
I'm the bad guy, Mac.

39:18.922 --> 39:19.774
All right?

39:21.083 --> 39:22.256
Let them go.

39:22.547 --> 39:25.104
You and your friends
Are dead.

39:26.438 --> 39:27.400
Mac.

39:28.525 --> 39:29.749
You lose this one.

39:29.795 --> 39:30.519
No!

39:36.553 --> 39:38.190
They never should have
Sent a woman.

39:38.190 --> 39:39.812
No, you did not.

39:59.553 --> 40:00.448
Pete.

40:01.195 --> 40:02.507
Anytime now.

40:16.372 --> 40:18.622
Agent Bering...
What the--

40:18.769 --> 40:19.489
There's no time.

40:19.489 --> 40:21.134
Just help me
Get this thing off!

40:21.301 --> 40:23.187
- can you disarm it?
- no.

40:24.730 --> 40:25.468
Is he still?

40:25.468 --> 40:27.352
No, but this thing
Is still ticking!

40:43.808 --> 40:44.582
Pete?

40:45.849 --> 40:46.935
Pete?

40:49.067 --> 40:50.164
Pete!

40:52.021 --> 40:53.108
What?
What?

40:54.741 --> 40:55.616
Oh, god.

41:03.216 --> 41:05.098
See?
It wasn't so hard, was it?

41:06.529 --> 41:06.892
No.

41:07.749 --> 41:09.700
No, it wasn't hard.
Not at all.

41:09.700 --> 41:11.903
No, it was almost,
I don't know, fun.

41:12.859 --> 41:13.327
Yeah.

41:14.757 --> 41:16.049
But, um...

41:18.921 --> 41:20.009
- Artie?
- mm-hmm?

41:20.478 --> 41:21.271
Yeah, what is it?

41:24.345 --> 41:26.785
Look, Artie, first off...

41:27.381 --> 41:30.812
We wanted to say thanks
For letting us use your car.

41:30.894 --> 41:32.072
- you know?
- oh.

41:32.353 --> 41:34.493
That GPS system,
That's--

41:34.493 --> 41:35.912
- just fantastic.
- fantastic.

41:35.912 --> 41:37.020
Yeah, and the seats?

41:37.678 --> 41:39.963
I think that leather
Was custom made, right?

41:39.963 --> 41:41.841
Was, like,
Corinthian leather.

41:42.507 --> 41:44.333
What happened to my car?

41:44.333 --> 41:46.542
Did you--
Did you ding it?

41:47.356 --> 41:48.223
No.

41:48.223 --> 41:50.173
- absolutely not.
- ding? No.

41:50.173 --> 41:51.368
- we didn't.
- then what?

41:52.505 --> 41:53.378
Okay, look.

41:53.378 --> 41:56.755
I needed somewhere
To throw the bomb.

41:56.939 --> 41:58.454
Someplace enclosed.

41:58.455 --> 41:59.284
Oh, god.

42:01.346 --> 42:04.917
We did manage
To save your cassette.

42:08.943 --> 42:10.055
I loved that car.

42:10.530 --> 42:12.839
Loved. Loved.

42:16.089 --> 42:20.498
- ah! Psych!
- that's what you get for lying to us.

42:20.931 --> 42:22.772
"let Myka think
That she's in charge, Pete."

42:22.772 --> 42:23.880
Yeah, "Pete’s touchy.

42:23.880 --> 42:25.597
Make him think
That he's in charge."

42:25.597 --> 42:26.679
You know what I’m saying?

42:26.903 --> 42:28.234
What a burn.

42:29.215 --> 42:30.398
That's good.
You like that?

42:30.398 --> 42:32.105
- I’ve been working on it all week.
- the eyes are a little--

42:32.264 --> 42:33.893
But it's the thing.
It's the mouth.

42:33.979 --> 42:35.039
Well, well, well.

42:35.637 --> 42:38.308
Look who's able to work on something
Together without arguing.

43:25.423 --> 43:26.487
Oh, my god.

43:27.838 --> 43:28.696
He's in.
