WEBVTT

00:17.142 --> 00:18.143
Hey!

00:21.563 --> 00:22.522
Um...

00:22.605 --> 00:25.358
Okay, so I know not showing up
last night was wrong.

00:25.692 --> 00:26.943
Very, super wrong.

00:27.360 --> 00:28.194
And bad.

00:28.528 --> 00:31.072
And I feel bad for the bad

00:31.156 --> 00:32.907
-and the wrong.
-Uh-huh.

00:33.616 --> 00:36.870
I had no idea how complicated
planning a scavenger hunt could be.

00:37.370 --> 00:39.205
And then April wanted the clues to rhyme

00:39.289 --> 00:42.417
and the playlist for the lock-in
was truly a struggle.

00:42.500 --> 00:45.086
I mean, I know that
"Don't Stop Believin'" is a classic,

00:45.170 --> 00:48.923
but it's about a girl taking a train
at midnight going anywhere.

00:49.132 --> 00:51.092
Is that the kind of behavior
we want to promote?

00:51.176 --> 00:52.469
I mean, there is such a thing--

00:52.802 --> 00:53.636
Hey!

00:53.720 --> 00:54.763
You never came.

00:55.263 --> 00:56.473
You knew I had a date with Miles.

00:56.556 --> 00:57.849
Shoot. Did you miss your date?

00:58.808 --> 01:00.477
We're broken up, Sterling.

01:00.560 --> 01:04.064
I ran back and forth
like a duck in a shooting game.

01:04.147 --> 01:06.149
And guess what? I got shot.

01:06.399 --> 01:07.358
Head clean off.

01:08.234 --> 01:09.069
Oh, Blair--

01:09.152 --> 01:11.696
And as if the night
wasn't enough of a living nightmare,

01:11.780 --> 01:14.532
I come home and I see this.

01:15.492 --> 01:17.160
-[gasps] What the--
-You told me to slap you

01:17.243 --> 01:18.161
if you kept going on about Mom,

01:18.244 --> 01:20.038
but I'm not prepared to get physical
because I'm feeling wrong and bad.

01:20.121 --> 01:22.957
Sterling... she is lying.

01:23.041 --> 01:23.875
This is symbolic.

01:24.584 --> 01:27.003
-Ow!
-I'm following orders, okay? Your orders.

01:27.087 --> 01:27.962
And I don't want to,

01:28.046 --> 01:30.131
but I will soap-opera slap you
if I need to.

01:30.215 --> 01:31.299
Your obsessed! It's unhealthy!

01:31.382 --> 01:32.550
I'll show you unhealthy!

01:32.634 --> 01:34.094
[both scream and groan]

01:34.177 --> 01:35.095
Get off my hair!

01:35.678 --> 01:38.014
Ouch! Sterling, get off of me!
You never win these fights.

01:38.098 --> 01:40.475
[both scream and groan]

01:40.558 --> 01:41.726
You know how this ends!

01:41.810 --> 01:42.685
-Blair!
-Give me your arm!

01:42.769 --> 01:44.521
-Blair, I'm kicking your butt!
-Give me your arm!

01:44.604 --> 01:45.939
-There it is!
-Give me your other arm!

01:46.022 --> 01:47.398
Look at this!

01:47.482 --> 01:50.693
-No!
-This is Mom in Savannah

01:50.777 --> 01:52.028
when she was a teenager.

01:52.112 --> 01:53.780
I'm closing my eyes! I can't see!

01:53.863 --> 01:55.615
Don't make me pry your eyelids open

01:55.698 --> 01:57.242
because you know that I will do it.

01:59.661 --> 02:02.080
-You see that sign? Hobo's Ham?
-[groans]

02:02.163 --> 02:03.498
Not a good name for a restaurant.

02:03.581 --> 02:05.583
It's like you're eating
a homeless person's pork.

02:05.667 --> 02:07.710
Pork that he probably had
to fight off other hobos to get,

02:07.794 --> 02:08.753
the way seagulls do.

02:08.837 --> 02:10.088
Well, they never franchised

02:10.171 --> 02:11.965
because there's only one in the state

02:12.048 --> 02:13.842
and it's in a town called...

02:16.261 --> 02:17.137
Nandina.

02:17.762 --> 02:20.974
[groans]
Blair. I'm losing feeling in my hands.

02:21.057 --> 02:24.227
If I let you up, will you promise
to listen to me and not slap me?

02:24.310 --> 02:26.896
I mean,
considering you ruined my entire life,

02:26.980 --> 02:28.231
I think you need to hear me out.

02:28.314 --> 02:29.858
-Fine, yes. I swear!
-[grunts]

02:33.319 --> 02:34.320
Okay. Listen.

02:34.404 --> 02:36.364
I looked through all the photo albums

02:36.447 --> 02:39.075
and there is not one picture
of Mom before college

02:39.159 --> 02:40.994
except from that box that she gave us.

02:41.327 --> 02:44.247
So then I Googled,
"Debbie Culpepper, Georgia."

02:44.330 --> 02:47.000
Oh, look, there's Mom's old manifesto
for the PTA coup.

02:47.083 --> 02:48.751
"Why Wallis Williams is unfit to lead.”

02:48.835 --> 02:51.421
-Mom was Miss Teen Georgia Peach, right?
-Mm.

02:51.504 --> 02:52.964
There's nothing about that here.

02:53.047 --> 02:56.384
It's like everything that happened
before 1999 in her life

02:56.634 --> 02:58.052
has been completely scrubbed.

02:58.136 --> 02:59.679
Maybe it was that Y2K thing
we learned about

02:59.762 --> 03:00.597
where old people freaked

03:00.680 --> 03:02.974
because they thought computers
were going to eat them.

03:04.100 --> 03:05.268
I know I'm right,

03:05.351 --> 03:07.687
-and after school I'm going to Grandina--
-Nandina.

03:07.770 --> 03:08.605
Shut up!

03:09.981 --> 03:12.525
I'm going there,
so find your own ride home after school.

03:13.860 --> 03:14.736
What if I go with you?

03:15.528 --> 03:18.031
-How would I know you'd show up?
-We could go right now.

03:18.740 --> 03:19.574
Like, now now?

03:19.657 --> 03:22.493
Yeah, like, skip school and hit the road.

03:23.077 --> 03:25.038
Miss Perfect is suggesting we skip school.

03:25.413 --> 03:27.498
Well, if you want to go,
then I want to be there for you.

03:29.667 --> 03:32.170
Fine, but I'm driving...

03:32.837 --> 03:35.965
-and I'm still mad at you.
-Noted.

03:36.049 --> 03:38.760
[theme music]

03:38.843 --> 03:41.137
[vocalizing]

03:57.695 --> 03:59.948
-I'm not gonna be at school today.
-[April] Are you sick?

04:00.031 --> 04:00.907
Tell me your symptoms.

04:00.990 --> 04:02.700
I carry Oscillococcinum
and Zinc in my bag,

04:02.784 --> 04:04.452
but do I need to Postmate
some antihistamines?

04:04.535 --> 04:05.620
I can't get sick.

04:05.703 --> 04:07.163
I'm not sick. I'm skipping.

04:07.997 --> 04:10.375
But only slackers
headed for City College skip.

04:10.458 --> 04:11.334
What's going on?

04:11.709 --> 04:13.586
Did you tell Blair about us?
Did she flip out?

04:13.670 --> 04:15.463
Are you on a Greyhound
heading west to start a new life?

04:15.546 --> 04:16.756
I haven't told her yet.

04:16.839 --> 04:18.675
I want to take the day with her,

04:18.758 --> 04:20.176
give her the space to absorb it.

04:21.427 --> 04:24.264
Miles broke up with her
and she's going through some stuff.

04:24.973 --> 04:25.890
Miles?

04:26.516 --> 04:28.643
You know Miles. He parks cars at the club.

04:28.726 --> 04:29.560
You've seen him.

04:29.686 --> 04:30.979
Oh, right, the tall black guy?

04:31.062 --> 04:32.313
-Don't say that.
-Why not?

04:32.397 --> 04:34.774
He's tall and he's black.

04:34.857 --> 04:36.609
Ezequiel calls you
"the white girl with the eyes."

04:36.693 --> 04:37.986
[approaching footsteps.

04:38.695 --> 04:40.280
Will you wipe and move it out already?

04:43.992 --> 04:44.951
I'll call you later.

04:45.034 --> 04:46.452
I miss your lips.

04:46.995 --> 04:48.121
I miss your lips.

04:48.705 --> 04:49.747
I miss your hair.

04:50.081 --> 04:51.207
I miss your smell.

04:56.087 --> 04:57.338
[April kisses over phone]

05:01.467 --> 05:02.343
Oh, hey.

05:02.427 --> 05:03.511
[disconnect tone]

05:03.594 --> 05:05.221
[blows through lips]

05:08.141 --> 05:09.225
What are you two doing here?

05:09.517 --> 05:11.102
I didn't blow my helper whistle.

05:11.185 --> 05:12.103
Who was that?

05:13.813 --> 05:14.647
My...

05:15.231 --> 05:16.065
perfumier.

05:16.149 --> 05:18.192
-[Ezequiel] Hm.
-We're working on a new scent blend.

05:18.276 --> 05:21.112
He's French, so we kiss goodbye.

05:21.195 --> 05:22.196
[all chuckle]

05:23.906 --> 05:26.242
So... what's the scent?

05:26.326 --> 05:27.327
We're working on it.

05:28.161 --> 05:29.245
There are notes of..

05:30.496 --> 05:31.331
hickory.

05:31.914 --> 05:32.832
[Ezequiel] Hmm.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.251
What happened last night?

05:35.543 --> 05:37.462
You were supposed to come
to my house for dinner.

05:38.129 --> 05:40.423
Here. I brought you your lamb chops.

05:45.553 --> 05:46.429
Something came up.

05:47.263 --> 05:49.307
Do you think
"Don't Stop Believin'" is inappropriate?

05:49.390 --> 05:52.226
Let me guess,
Sterling Wesley has boring taste in music.

05:52.310 --> 05:53.561
Surprise, surprise.

05:53.644 --> 05:55.605
She's more eclectic than you think.

05:55.688 --> 05:57.357
Oh. Is she?

05:57.440 --> 06:00.193
Look, crafting a playlist
is difficult. Okay?

06:00.276 --> 06:02.362
Now, did you two make the list
for the Costco run yet?

06:02.445 --> 06:03.738
Because a lock-in without snacks

06:03.821 --> 06:05.323
is basically solitary confinement,

06:05.406 --> 06:06.949
but with lots of other people,

06:07.033 --> 06:08.451
so... worse.

06:08.534 --> 06:10.745
My point is, make the list. Okay?

06:10.828 --> 06:11.996
And include breath mints.

06:13.206 --> 06:15.750
It's a long night. I gotta go.

06:22.799 --> 06:24.801
[bottle clatters]

06:34.727 --> 06:35.812
Do we want a taser?

06:36.437 --> 06:38.022
Why not? Throw it in.

06:38.106 --> 06:39.357
I'm not seeing handcuffs.

06:39.440 --> 06:40.650
Check in the desk.

06:46.489 --> 06:47.323
You find some?

06:47.407 --> 06:49.492
No, but I found something else. Come here.

06:52.620 --> 06:53.496
Oh.

06:54.414 --> 06:57.583
[scoffs] That does not look like
a comfortable position to sleep in.

06:57.667 --> 06:59.502
-[Sterling] He'll be achey.
-He should stretch.

06:59.585 --> 07:00.962
I don't think Bowser stretches.

07:01.045 --> 07:02.255
He has the posture of a fishhook.

07:02.338 --> 07:03.506
We could show him some stretches.

07:03.589 --> 07:06.217
Like the warm-up we learned
when we had Zumba for PE?

07:07.802 --> 07:10.012
Left arm reach, right arm reach,

07:10.096 --> 07:12.306
Swirl your hips
like you’re on the beach...

07:12.390 --> 07:13.724
-[Bowser] Okay.
-Left arm reach...

07:13.808 --> 07:15.768
So, this is how I die?

07:16.894 --> 07:19.897
Laying on the floor
while two white ladies Zumba over me.

07:20.440 --> 07:22.483
Stop, please stop. Please stop! Stop.

07:22.567 --> 07:23.568
We woke him up.

07:24.235 --> 07:25.194
-Good morning!
-Hi!

07:25.278 --> 07:26.571
Why are y'all here?

07:26.654 --> 07:28.114
Why are you here, huh?

07:28.197 --> 07:29.490
This is my damn office.

07:29.574 --> 07:31.617
I can be here any damn time I please.

07:31.909 --> 07:33.077
-Well, damn.
-[Bowser groans]

07:33.661 --> 07:34.787
Shouldn't y'all be at school?

07:34.871 --> 07:40.501
Yes, we are doing a self-defense
demonstration for PE

07:40.585 --> 07:42.837
and, uh, it's graded and everything,

07:42.920 --> 07:45.214
and Sterling forgot to prepare

07:45.298 --> 07:47.925
because she's been forgetting
a lot of important things lately,

07:48.009 --> 07:50.303
for which there are really no excuses,

07:50.386 --> 07:53.347
and often, very serious consequences.

07:53.431 --> 07:56.893
For which she is genuinely
and sincerely very sorry.

07:56.976 --> 08:00.229
So, we need to borrow
some self-defense demonstration things.

08:01.397 --> 08:02.482
[Bowser] Have at it.

08:04.734 --> 08:05.568
Bowser?

08:06.360 --> 08:07.445
Mm-hm.

08:07.862 --> 08:10.948
Why do you smell like a gas station
that sells wine?

08:11.032 --> 08:14.160
[grunts]
Because I bought wine at a gas station!

08:14.494 --> 08:15.786
After I left Yolanda's house.

08:15.870 --> 08:18.164
After I found her there with Terrance.

08:19.040 --> 08:22.210
After I thought,
"Do I have feelings for Yolanda?"

08:22.877 --> 08:26.380
After I went there to tell her
I had news about the Fren-Z case

08:26.464 --> 08:28.716
and maybe ask her out for some soft tacos.

08:29.091 --> 08:31.427
After I told her
I wasn't working with her anymore,

08:31.511 --> 08:32.345
and I quit.

08:32.428 --> 08:33.846
-No. Uh-uh.
-No, yeah.

08:33.930 --> 08:36.557
You have got to go and get that case back.

08:36.641 --> 08:37.558
No...

08:37.642 --> 08:39.727
I lost the only man I'll ever love
for that case.

08:39.810 --> 08:40.811
Yeah, okay?

08:40.895 --> 08:42.939
You have to go back and fight for Yolanda.

08:43.356 --> 08:45.066
Offer her hard tacos.

08:45.149 --> 08:50.029
And yes, Terrance may be
a very charming, good-looking man

08:50.112 --> 08:53.366
with a gorgeous smile
and a twinkle in his eye,

08:54.033 --> 08:56.452
but... but you are Bowser!

08:56.536 --> 08:58.454
Women don't really care about
that other stuff!

08:58.538 --> 08:59.914
Oh, women hate that stuff, huh?

08:59.997 --> 09:01.999
Yeah, believe me. I know what women like.

09:02.083 --> 09:03.125
You don't know anything.

09:03.209 --> 09:04.252
You don't know what I know.

09:04.335 --> 09:05.169
Oh, really?

09:05.253 --> 09:06.629
-Hey, hey, oh.
-Yeah!

09:07.088 --> 09:08.089
What's with you two?

09:08.422 --> 09:11.217
Snappin' at each other
like betta fish sharing a bowl.

09:11.634 --> 09:12.635
We're having issues.

09:12.969 --> 09:14.387
Well, get over them.

09:14.470 --> 09:15.930
You're family. Figure it out.

09:16.013 --> 09:17.682
Might we not say the same thing
about Yolanda?

09:17.765 --> 09:19.058
Not if he's into her.

09:19.141 --> 09:20.309
That would be gross.

09:20.393 --> 09:24.397
We can be Bowser's family,
but she is his love interest. Duh.

09:24.480 --> 09:26.691
But once you're with someone,
doesn't that make you family,

09:26.774 --> 09:29.110
-like, by marriage or whatever?
-That's stupid.

09:29.193 --> 09:30.570
No, it's not. It's a valid question.

09:30.653 --> 09:31.988
-Stupid!
-Is not!

09:32.071 --> 09:34.323
-Okay. Okay. Hey, hey, cut it out.
-[both shouting]

09:34.782 --> 09:35.950
All right? Dirty laundry.

09:36.242 --> 09:37.827

20:04.912 --> 20:07.039
All right, head down Main,
past Tom Fassbender's place.

20:07.122 --> 20:08.123
If you see his dog, do not slow down,

20:08.207 --> 20:09.625
she will bite clean through your tires.

20:09.708 --> 20:12.336
Turn left at the big tree,
left at the tractor wreck.

20:12.836 --> 20:14.713
If you hit the ravine,
don't look down in there,

20:14.796 --> 20:15.797
head back up the hill.

20:16.256 --> 20:19.593
Uh, I’m gonna tell you though,
that church is crazy.

20:19.927 --> 20:24.264
Tabernacle Church of Christ the Redeemer,
The Living God, and His Army?

20:25.224 --> 20:27.434
You know, the longer the name,
the more extreme.

20:27.893 --> 20:29.061
Are you sure we want to do this?

20:29.144 --> 20:30.312
Bailing on me again?

20:30.520 --> 20:32.940
No, no, no, no, I'm ready. Let's do this.

20:33.106 --> 20:34.233
I'm so ready.

20:34.316 --> 20:35.901
[dogs barking]

20:36.401 --> 20:38.070
In the car! Now! Quick! Quick! Quick!

20:40.030 --> 20:41.031
[man] Try and look busy.

20:42.324 --> 20:43.408
I am busy.

20:43.825 --> 20:45.160
I'm doing my job.

20:45.661 --> 20:48.121
Hey, could you look in the camera
for a sec,

20:48.205 --> 20:49.331
and maybe say,

20:50.249 --> 20:51.708
"It's collab time."

20:51.792 --> 20:53.085
-That's good.
-That's good, right?

20:53.168 --> 20:55.170
TMZ, get the fuck out of my office.

20:55.671 --> 20:56.505
Go!

20:57.381 --> 20:59.716
-[object clatters]
-[Terrance] Uh, yeah, take a break, Phil.

21:00.467 --> 21:03.262
We'll grab his intro later
when he's not in a mood.

21:04.429 --> 21:06.556
Trust me, this will always be my mood.

21:07.724 --> 21:08.809
[groans]

21:08.892 --> 21:11.353
All right, what we got on Fren-Z?

21:11.436 --> 21:12.562
[sighs]

21:12.646 --> 21:14.731
Well, he's trying to finish up a track

21:14.815 --> 21:16.608
and get his ass down to the Maldives.

21:17.484 --> 21:18.610
He can't fly commercial,

21:18.694 --> 21:20.570
so he'll be looking for a private ride.

21:20.654 --> 21:23.323
The record company
is trying to distance themselves from him,

21:23.407 --> 21:24.700
so they won't be offering.

21:25.075 --> 21:26.827
So who can he turn to?

21:27.119 --> 21:28.996
Who in Atlanta

21:29.413 --> 21:31.790
is rich enough to have their own plane

21:32.499 --> 21:36.003
and powerful enough to do Fren-Z a solid
without getting in trouble?

21:38.964 --> 21:40.173
[both] Tyler Perry!

21:40.257 --> 21:41.258
[both chuckle]

21:41.341 --> 21:43.427
-[Debbie] Mr. Bowser?
-[Bowser chuckles]

21:44.094 --> 21:47.097
Oh, hi! I'm not sure if you remember me.

21:47.180 --> 21:50.058
Uh, Debbie Wesley.
I'm Blair and Sterling's mom.

21:50.142 --> 21:51.476
-I came by to see--
-Yes, of course.

21:51.560 --> 21:53.020
You ordered a teeny-tiny yogurt

21:53.103 --> 21:55.063
and then pushed it around the cup
instead of eating it.

21:55.147 --> 21:58.859
[chuckles] Yes, well, I've been doing
that intermittent fasting, so...

21:58.942 --> 22:00.736
[chuckles and clears throat]

22:00.819 --> 22:02.154
Sorry if that upset you.

22:02.237 --> 22:04.531
I don't care what you do with it
once it's paid for.

22:04.614 --> 22:07.367
That's just the image I used
to place you in my mind palace.

22:07.451 --> 22:09.536
I found a parking space.
Does he know where the girls are?

22:09.619 --> 22:11.496
-Do you know where the girls are?
-The girls?

22:11.580 --> 22:12.581
Uh, the school called today.

22:12.664 --> 22:13.999
They didn't show up.

22:14.082 --> 22:15.751
We thought you might know where they are.

22:15.834 --> 22:17.252
They're not answering their phones.

22:18.462 --> 22:21.590
No, I don't have them
on the schedule today, but, uh...

22:22.466 --> 22:23.800
I'll be sure to keep an eye out.

22:23.884 --> 22:26.386
Thank you. I'd appreciate that.

22:26.470 --> 22:28.305
We do appreciate that.

22:28.388 --> 22:29.973
Yeah, it'll be fine.

22:30.390 --> 22:31.224
Teenagers.

22:31.558 --> 22:32.476
[chuckles]

22:33.226 --> 22:34.353
When we were teenagers,

22:34.436 --> 22:37.022
my brother blew up an armadillo
with a Roman candle.

22:37.773 --> 22:38.607
It was awful.

22:40.108 --> 22:40.984
[Debbie] Right. Um...

22:41.068 --> 22:43.487
Well, here are our numbers.

22:43.570 --> 22:46.573
Uh... Could you just give us a call
if they pop by for yogurt?

22:47.032 --> 22:48.158
Thank you, Mr. Bowser.

22:48.241 --> 22:49.868
-Okay, now.
-Thank you.

22:50.369 --> 22:51.203
Bye, now.

23:04.466 --> 23:06.176
[cell phones ding]

23:08.345 --> 23:09.846
Mom and Dad went to Bowser?

23:09.930 --> 23:11.264
They totally know we're ditching.

23:11.348 --> 23:12.391
We've come too far.

23:12.474 --> 23:14.893
Ignore, block. We'll deal with it later.

23:16.436 --> 23:17.396
Hey.

23:19.773 --> 23:22.234
Jones, Perry, Pierce...

23:23.276 --> 23:25.195
Culpepper. Boom.

23:25.946 --> 23:27.114
They spelled it with one P.

23:27.197 --> 23:28.865
Mom's got two Ps in her maiden name.

23:30.242 --> 23:31.159
There's the other P.

23:31.243 --> 23:34.329
[woman] Are you girls here
for the Rapture preparation class?

23:34.788 --> 23:36.832
It's not for another hour.

23:38.041 --> 23:41.795
Uh... No, ma'am, we're just looking around

23:42.629 --> 23:44.965
tracing back our family roots, actually.

23:45.048 --> 23:48.718
Would you happen to know the Culpeppers,
by any chance?

23:51.096 --> 23:52.639
Culpepper.

23:52.722 --> 23:53.849
Culpepper.

23:54.516 --> 23:55.809
Cul... pepper.

23:56.852 --> 23:58.186
Culpepper.

23:59.146 --> 24:00.313
Culpepper.

24:01.106 --> 24:02.315
Culpepper.

24:03.191 --> 24:08.572
Ah. Yes, just had to locate them
in my recollection storehouse.

24:09.072 --> 24:11.241
They moved away a long time ago.

24:11.825 --> 24:13.410
-How long ago?
-Oh...

24:13.493 --> 24:14.661
I don't know.

24:15.537 --> 24:16.746
Poor things.

24:17.205 --> 24:18.206
Poor things?

24:18.290 --> 24:20.792
I remember feeling very bad for them.

24:20.876 --> 24:23.003
-Because they lived here?
-Pardon me.

24:23.086 --> 24:25.422
I live here and it happens to be...

24:26.965 --> 24:29.134
a nice reminder that the world to come

24:29.217 --> 24:30.969
will be a whole lot better.

24:33.388 --> 24:35.056
So, why do you feel bad for them?

24:35.432 --> 24:38.393
Well, they had such a time
with that daughter of theirs.

24:38.477 --> 24:41.521
Oh, no, what'd she do?

24:41.605 --> 24:44.232
We do not gossip in this church,
young lady.

24:44.524 --> 24:47.194
A bullfrog only has to croak once

24:47.277 --> 24:49.362
to wake up the entire pond.

24:49.446 --> 24:51.823
But, suffice it to say...

24:51.907 --> 24:54.242
she danced with the devil, that one.

24:55.202 --> 24:56.536
We all prayed for them,

24:56.620 --> 25:00.457
especially after that unfortunate business
with the police.

25:00.957 --> 25:02.292
-The police?
-Uh-uh!

25:02.792 --> 25:05.086
Without wood, a fire goes out.

25:05.420 --> 25:07.797
I am not giving you any more wood.

25:09.216 --> 25:14.888
But, um, would you care to make a donation
to our congregation?

25:15.430 --> 25:18.266
One of our snakes recently passed.

25:19.559 --> 25:20.435
[Blair] Oh.

25:21.019 --> 25:21.895
We...

25:22.562 --> 25:24.856
spent all our money at Hobo's Ham.

25:24.940 --> 25:25.774
Oh.

25:25.857 --> 25:28.944
Well, in that case, I'd stick close
to a restroom if I was you.

25:29.027 --> 25:30.612
Thank you, ma'am. We will.

25:30.695 --> 25:32.113
It was nice talking to you.

25:32.197 --> 25:33.114
Have a blessed day.

25:34.032 --> 25:37.536
Are you sure you don't want
to come back to the Rapture class?

25:37.827 --> 25:41.039
When that trumpet sounds,
we need to be prepared.

25:41.122 --> 25:43.625
Oh, um, we're doing an independent study,

25:43.708 --> 25:44.876
but thank you, ma'am.

25:45.710 --> 25:46.711
[cell phone beeps]

25:47.712 --> 25:49.714
Independent study?

25:52.717 --> 25:54.886
[students chattering]

26:04.104 --> 26:06.147
April! You are MOBOT.

26:06.231 --> 26:07.399
Um, what? No, I'm not.

26:07.482 --> 26:10.819
Yes, you are.
You are missing out because of texting.

26:11.570 --> 26:13.655
Don't become a robot who is a MOBOT.

26:13.738 --> 26:14.614
Okay?

26:14.698 --> 26:17.742
[mimics robot]
I am a robot who is a MOBOT.

26:17.867 --> 26:18.785
I am--

26:19.953 --> 26:20.912
She remarried?

26:21.705 --> 26:22.581
[sighs]

26:23.331 --> 26:24.165
I mean...

26:25.458 --> 26:27.168
Just put it away. Okay?

26:27.794 --> 26:29.296
Okay. I'll put it away.

26:29.379 --> 26:30.964
And look, you are doing great work.

26:31.381 --> 26:32.799
Okay? I love you.

26:34.426 --> 26:36.136
[sighs] Look at all this work.

26:41.224 --> 26:42.183
Hey!

26:42.267 --> 26:45.020
I wouldn't get too close.
Apparently, I'm MOBOT.

26:45.103 --> 26:48.857
Yeah. Well, yesterday I was missing out
because of fantasy football. MOBOFF?

26:50.191 --> 26:51.943
-It sounds kind of dirty, right?
-[chuckles]

26:52.777 --> 26:55.113
-Ellen really loves acronyms.
-[chuckles]

26:55.196 --> 26:56.031
Yeah.

26:56.114 --> 26:57.907
I heard you were with Sterling last night?

26:57.991 --> 26:59.743
What do you--?
What do you mean? What did you hear?

26:59.826 --> 27:03.204
That you guys were, like,
making playlists and clues and stuff?

27:03.663 --> 27:05.957
-How is she?
-I don't know. Fine.

27:07.083 --> 27:09.085
Why do you even care?
Aren't you two broken up?

27:09.169 --> 27:13.131
No. No. We're just working on ourselves
independently from one another.

27:13.715 --> 27:15.759
And I've been working really, really hard,

27:16.051 --> 27:17.802
and I've been giving her a lot of space,

27:18.345 --> 27:21.848
uh, but I would like to close that space.
There's-- There's just too much space.

27:22.349 --> 27:23.391
Did-- Hey, hey...

27:23.475 --> 27:24.976
Did she say anything about me?

27:25.644 --> 27:26.478
Luke...

27:28.229 --> 27:31.483
[scoffs] Every time I say your name,
I want to tell you to "use the Force."

27:31.566 --> 27:33.401
Oh, yeah, yeah, I get that a lot.

27:33.485 --> 27:35.236
I actually tried to use the Force one time

27:35.320 --> 27:38.573
to lift the fridge in our garage
off my favorite frisbee golf frisbee.

27:40.116 --> 27:42.035
I popped one of my eardrums real bad.

27:45.080 --> 27:47.374
Hey, what can you tell me about Sterli?

27:48.333 --> 27:50.669
To... stick with the theme...

27:51.586 --> 27:54.923
I think right now her space

27:55.006 --> 28:00.804
is in a galaxy
far, far away from your space.

28:03.014 --> 28:03.890
She's moved on.

28:06.434 --> 28:08.311
I find your lack of faith disturbing.

28:09.604 --> 28:11.314
I'm not saying this to be hurtful.

28:13.525 --> 28:14.442
I'm saying it as a friend.

28:15.944 --> 28:19.531
Maybe it would be good for you to...
start thinking about moving on,

28:20.573 --> 28:21.700
save yourself some heartache.

28:23.618 --> 28:27.956
"You can't stop change any more
than you can stop the suns from setting."

28:28.415 --> 28:29.874
You're, like, a legit Star Wars fan.

28:30.333 --> 28:32.419
Daddy and I watched them
whenever we have time together.

28:32.502 --> 28:33.503
It's our thing.

28:35.922 --> 28:36.756
Was our thing.

28:37.382 --> 28:39.884
Yeah, I hear things have been
really rough at your house lately.

28:40.427 --> 28:41.511
I'm really sorry about that.

28:43.304 --> 28:44.139
Yeah, well.

28:46.766 --> 28:48.184
I'm sorry about you and Sterling.

28:48.268 --> 28:50.854
You know, she's--
she's not acting right. I'm--

28:51.938 --> 28:54.399
I'm about this close
to being halfway angry at her.

28:54.482 --> 28:55.316
I get it.

29:02.615 --> 29:04.200
Girls, I just want to know
you're all right.

29:05.535 --> 29:06.453
Gettin' a little nervous here

29:06.536 --> 29:09.789
because I know how much
the two of you love your devices.

29:10.415 --> 29:11.374
So, um...

29:12.542 --> 29:15.837
why don't we take a break from
the SnapTalk and the TicTac and...

29:16.713 --> 29:18.840
you know, give old Bowser a call...

29:20.258 --> 29:21.301
so I don't worry.

29:22.719 --> 29:24.220
-All right.
-That's it?

29:24.345 --> 29:25.722
Yeah. Press "end."

29:26.556 --> 29:29.100
Uh... you don't press "send"
on a voice message--

29:29.184 --> 29:31.436
I said press "end." Damn it. "End."

29:31.519 --> 29:33.021
[sighs] Gotcha.

29:33.563 --> 29:34.481
Night night.

29:35.440 --> 29:37.400
-It's not even night.
-The ladies love it.

29:37.484 --> 29:40.111
They're girls! Okay? Not ladies.

29:40.570 --> 29:42.238
Listen to Daddy over here.

29:42.322 --> 29:44.365
What's your deal with those two, anyway?

29:44.449 --> 29:46.242
I'm a teacher who respects his students.

29:46.326 --> 29:47.869
I got their back. They got mine.

29:47.952 --> 29:49.788
See, that's your mistake right there.

29:49.871 --> 29:51.748
This is a business for lone wolves.

29:51.831 --> 29:53.416
You think someone's got your back

29:53.500 --> 29:55.668
and then you turn around
and they're stabbing you in it.

29:57.128 --> 29:58.922
You get that? I'm giving you gold here.

29:59.005 --> 30:00.632
Oh, shoot... um, no.

30:01.299 --> 30:03.802
-Was I supposed to be filming?
-Always be filming, bro!

30:03.885 --> 30:05.804
It's your job. Do your job, man.

30:07.347 --> 30:09.307
See? Can't rely on anybody.

30:09.390 --> 30:10.475
Tell me about it.

30:10.767 --> 30:13.228
-You want to repeat that line?
-No, the moment's passed.

30:13.311 --> 30:15.104
[blows out] Thank God.

30:16.981 --> 30:18.066
[clicks teeth]

30:18.817 --> 30:21.361
This business is for lone wolves.

30:21.694 --> 30:22.987
You think someone's got your back

30:23.071 --> 30:24.989
and then you turn around
and they're stabbin' you in it.

30:25.073 --> 30:28.284
This job is about self-reliance
and the purity of competition.

30:28.368 --> 30:29.702
That's what keeps me turned on.

30:29.786 --> 30:31.246
That keeps you turned on, huh?

30:31.329 --> 30:32.956
Hell, yeah. What turns you on?

30:35.500 --> 30:36.334
Yolanda.

30:36.751 --> 30:37.836
She turns me on, too.

30:37.919 --> 30:38.878
Not like that.

30:40.797 --> 30:42.465
I've got real feelings for her, man.

30:43.216 --> 30:44.050
Could you speak up?

30:44.509 --> 30:46.135
You know what, if you don't stop

30:46.386 --> 30:47.679
and shut that shit down right now,

30:47.762 --> 30:49.848
I'm gonna throw this out the window.
You understand me?

30:49.931 --> 30:51.391
[cameraman] Please, please don't.

30:51.474 --> 30:54.269
I keep forgetting I'm being filmed
all the goddamn time.

30:54.519 --> 30:56.896
[Terrance]
God, get with the times, Bowser.

30:56.980 --> 30:58.565
No one is ever not being filmed.

30:58.648 --> 31:00.149
The world is made of cameras.

31:00.900 --> 31:03.528
May I please get my cross-stitch back?
I shut it off.

31:03.611 --> 31:04.696
-[Bowser] Later!
-Okay.

31:04.988 --> 31:06.406
I'm holding it for insurance.

31:06.489 --> 31:07.949
I got feelings for Yolanda.

31:08.950 --> 31:10.702
You think I make my buns for just anyone?

31:10.785 --> 31:12.078
I thought you were a lone wolf.

31:12.453 --> 31:14.497
Don't mean I don't like myself
a little lamb.

31:14.914 --> 31:15.915
A boy's gotta eat.

31:15.999 --> 31:17.917
Yolanda may be a lot of things,

31:18.001 --> 31:20.503
but a little lamb sure ain't one of 'em.

31:21.296 --> 31:23.047
You don't know her. I know her.

31:23.590 --> 31:25.174
I've known her 20 years now.

31:25.258 --> 31:26.092
Hm.

31:26.801 --> 31:29.429
You'd think you would have done something
about it in all that time.

31:33.975 --> 31:35.059
You can't bring this in.

31:35.143 --> 31:37.937
Oh, right. Can you hold on to it for me?

31:38.479 --> 31:39.397
No problem.

31:49.616 --> 31:51.409
[man chattering]

31:52.619 --> 31:54.662
Well, hey there.

31:54.954 --> 31:57.332
I'm Blair. How are you doing today?

31:57.415 --> 32:00.919
I was hoping that you could
help me with something.

32:02.503 --> 32:04.339
-You trying to flirt with me?
-Maybe.

32:05.214 --> 32:06.341
How am I doing?

32:07.550 --> 32:08.384
Terribly.

32:08.468 --> 32:10.678
You're blinking
like you got ash in your eye

32:10.762 --> 32:12.889
and you're trying to get
a gay man to look at your tits.

32:12.972 --> 32:13.806
Put them away.

32:13.890 --> 32:14.933
Oh.

32:15.016 --> 32:16.225
Did it ever cross your mind to just,

32:16.309 --> 32:18.603
I don't know, ask for what you want
like a person?

32:18.686 --> 32:19.729
You'll have to forgive my sister.

32:19.812 --> 32:21.606
She's internalized the societal messaging

32:21.689 --> 32:23.942
that women are only as valuable
as their sexual appeal,

32:24.025 --> 32:25.443
so this has been a valuable reckoning.

32:25.526 --> 32:26.361
Thank you.

32:26.444 --> 32:28.988
And my sister has
internalized the societal messaging

32:29.072 --> 32:31.407
that sisters can be unreliable
and selfish,

32:31.950 --> 32:33.368
but I don't blame society...

32:34.160 --> 32:34.994
I blame her.

32:35.078 --> 32:36.829
I really like your glasses.

32:36.913 --> 32:38.498
[gasps] Vintage.

32:38.581 --> 32:40.249
Nice, right? I had my prescription put in.

32:40.333 --> 32:41.834
They're in perfect condition.

32:41.918 --> 32:44.212
I found a pair like those
in the Sally Army once,

32:44.295 --> 32:46.381
but the stems were so chewed up,
they looked like jerky.

32:46.464 --> 32:48.549
These were dead stock, still in the box.

32:48.633 --> 32:51.010
That dummy at that shop
had no idea what she had,

32:51.094 --> 32:52.887
so I bought myself seven pairs.

32:52.971 --> 32:55.473
I'm saving two,
and puttin' the rest on Etsy.

32:55.807 --> 32:56.933
I'm a businessman.

32:57.016 --> 32:58.851
Brilliant, and a heck of a score.

32:59.143 --> 33:00.186
I'm Sterling, by the way.

33:00.269 --> 33:01.396
Nice to meet you, I'm Garrett.

33:01.479 --> 33:03.398
That's the way to have a conversation.

33:04.190 --> 33:05.525
What can I do you for, Miss Sterling?

33:05.608 --> 33:06.901
Well, we're looking for some information

33:06.985 --> 33:08.736
on a woman that used to live here
in Nannadina.

33:08.820 --> 33:10.279
[chuckles] Nandina.

33:10.363 --> 33:11.489
See, it is hard to remember.

33:12.949 --> 33:14.867
-Debbie Culpepper.
-Two Ps.

33:14.951 --> 33:15.952
With two Ps.

33:16.035 --> 33:18.121
Her birthday is February 26, 1981,

33:18.204 --> 33:19.747
and we think she might have
a police record.

33:19.831 --> 33:22.500
Fill out this form.
Name, phone, email address,

33:22.583 --> 33:24.210
and I'll see
what I can come up with for you.

33:30.883 --> 33:31.843
I like your shirt.

33:32.218 --> 33:34.137
-Really? "I like your shirt"?
-Hey!

33:35.096 --> 33:36.139
I'm going through a breakup.

33:37.724 --> 33:39.183
Cut me a little slack, man.

33:39.600 --> 33:40.601
[man] Just sit down.

33:43.354 --> 33:45.148
[bell rings]

33:45.982 --> 33:47.608
So, we know for sure he's here, right?

33:47.692 --> 33:48.735
Yeah, that's what my girl told me.

33:50.153 --> 33:53.614
-So, you already stepping out on Yolanda?
-It ain't even like that.

33:54.073 --> 33:57.702
Darlene is hard where I like it soft.

33:58.161 --> 33:59.203
We go to the same gym.

33:59.287 --> 34:01.497
Lady's lean like Fight Club Pitt.

34:02.165 --> 34:04.292
She mentioned once on a lag day
that she works here

34:04.375 --> 34:06.169
and I added it to my memory castle.

34:08.171 --> 34:09.338
So, what's your plan here?

34:09.422 --> 34:10.965
I gotta feel out the situation.

34:11.799 --> 34:12.925
I work on instinct.

34:13.593 --> 34:14.427
Why? You got a plan?

34:14.510 --> 34:17.055
Yeah, my plan is to get this over with
as quickly as possible.

34:17.472 --> 34:18.347
That was my plan.

34:19.515 --> 34:20.641
[tires screech]

34:20.725 --> 34:21.726
Hey, Terrence.

34:21.809 --> 34:25.021
See, one of the most important things
to have when you're a bounty hunter...

34:25.521 --> 34:26.564
is contacts.

34:27.398 --> 34:29.942
I'm a lone wolf,
but I still have contacts.

34:30.860 --> 34:32.779
Gonna call this episode "Lone Wolf."

34:32.862 --> 34:35.073
You realize
we are working this case together, right?

34:35.156 --> 34:37.450
Yeeeeah, I think I'll edit around you.

34:37.533 --> 34:39.577
So what do you do exactly on the lot here?

34:39.660 --> 34:40.661
I'm the beekeeper.

34:40.745 --> 34:42.288
We got bee boxes all over.

34:42.371 --> 34:44.290
Mr. Perry loves fresh honey.

34:44.540 --> 34:47.168
Don't know that he eats it,
but he uses a lot of it.

34:48.294 --> 34:49.170
I don't ask.

34:49.253 --> 34:51.339
You think we could, uh, borrow your bees?

34:51.631 --> 34:53.382
Use them to flush this guy off the stage?

34:53.466 --> 34:54.300
Fuck, no!

34:54.383 --> 34:56.385
My bees are docile and lovely.

34:57.261 --> 34:59.639
So, how do you keep 'em calm?
You use smoke?

34:59.722 --> 35:01.265
How do you know so much about bees?

35:01.349 --> 35:03.351
Oh, that Secret Life of Bees movie.

35:03.476 --> 35:04.977
I love me some Queen Latifah.

35:05.061 --> 35:06.395
[Terrance] I know that movie.

35:06.479 --> 35:08.356
Back when Jennifer Hudson
still had some meat on her.

35:09.148 --> 35:11.359
So, uh... can we borrow your smoker?

35:12.235 --> 35:13.528
The smoker you can borrow.

35:13.611 --> 35:14.821
[chuckles]

35:14.904 --> 35:16.197
I see where this is going.

35:16.614 --> 35:17.615
Phil, mount up! Let's go.

35:18.032 --> 35:21.119
Terrance Coin
is going to smoke out his mark.

35:22.286 --> 35:23.246
Great idea.

35:23.788 --> 35:24.914
My idea.

35:37.218 --> 35:38.594
[Sterling] Can you sit still?

35:38.678 --> 35:40.930
No. No, I can't.

35:42.265 --> 35:45.518
Can you please respect
my investment in this mystery?

35:45.601 --> 35:48.855
This mystery that involves our mother?

35:48.938 --> 35:52.316
I mean, I think the real question is,
why aren't you pacing?

35:52.608 --> 35:53.985
Have you no curiosity?

35:54.443 --> 35:56.320
Wonder? Alarm?

35:56.404 --> 35:59.365
-I mean, are you dead inside?
-[man] Okay.

36:00.908 --> 36:04.162
There is no arrest record
for Debbie Culpepper,

36:04.537 --> 36:06.622
or Deborah, or Debs.

36:06.706 --> 36:09.375
But we know she had a run-in
with the police.

36:09.458 --> 36:11.169
A woman of God told us

36:11.502 --> 36:14.005
and a local pig monger
pretty much corroborated, so...

36:14.088 --> 36:16.257
Okay, well, maybe it happened
when she was a minor.

36:16.340 --> 36:18.593
She wouldn't be in the database
if she was underage.

36:18.676 --> 36:20.344
[Blair] No, that is not good enough.

36:20.428 --> 36:21.971
There has to be something else.

36:22.054 --> 36:24.473
You're not even trying. Can I please--

36:24.557 --> 36:25.850
-Hey! My picture!
-I am so sorry, Garrett.

36:25.933 --> 36:27.935
She goes crazy when her blood sugar's low.

36:28.019 --> 36:29.520
Thank you for trying.
It was nice to meet you.

36:29.604 --> 36:32.190
It is always nice
to meet a fellow vintage lover.

36:32.273 --> 36:34.275
-You have a nice day.
-Thank you.

36:34.358 --> 36:36.068
-I don't have low blood sugar!
-No! Get back!

36:36.152 --> 36:37.820
-Blair! Sorry!
-He's not really looking.

36:37.904 --> 36:39.280
-He wasn't even looking--
-No wonder you're single.

36:40.031 --> 36:41.490
What the hell are you doing?

36:41.574 --> 36:43.743
What am I doing?
You're acting like a lunatic!

36:43.826 --> 36:45.661
I knew it was a mistake to bring you here.

36:45.745 --> 36:46.871
You don't have my back.

36:46.954 --> 36:48.164
I should have done this myself.

36:48.247 --> 36:49.582
Are you frickin' kidding me?

36:49.832 --> 36:52.001
All I've done today
is support you and help you.

36:52.084 --> 36:53.961
I apologize, again and again--

36:54.045 --> 36:55.963
Saying you're sorry
doesn't fix what you did!

36:56.214 --> 36:57.965
You destroyed my relationship!

36:59.133 --> 37:01.510
You could have rescheduled
your date, Blair!

37:01.594 --> 37:02.845
-Oh, yeah?
-You could have faked sick

37:02.929 --> 37:04.096
like that time in French class

37:04.180 --> 37:06.140
when you claimed you
had alien hand syndrome,

37:06.224 --> 37:08.684
but no, as always, you went for
the highest level of drama possible,

37:08.768 --> 37:10.102
because that's what you do.

37:10.186 --> 37:11.729
What the fuck is that supposed to mean?

37:11.812 --> 37:13.147
Oh, let's see, where do I begin?

37:13.231 --> 37:16.651
Um, you desperately tried to have sex
with Jennings as fast as possible,

37:16.734 --> 37:18.569
to reclaim your title as the slutty twin.

37:18.653 --> 37:21.572
You said that a substitute teacher's ghost
was haunting you.

37:21.656 --> 37:24.492
You literally think that Mom
is some kind of criminal queen-pin.

37:24.575 --> 37:26.327
You can't ever let things be normal!

37:26.410 --> 37:28.788
Everything has to be a disaster,
a hullabaloo!

37:28.871 --> 37:29.830
Yeah, I said hullabaloo!

37:29.914 --> 37:31.290
So it makes perfect sense

37:31.374 --> 37:34.126
that as soon as you get a nice,
stable relationship,

37:34.210 --> 37:37.421
you immediately self-sabotage
and make it blow up in your face.

37:37.505 --> 37:39.840
Poor, unique, special, interesting Blair.

37:39.924 --> 37:40.800
Jealous.

37:40.883 --> 37:43.386
You're jealous because my life

37:43.469 --> 37:46.264
is whimsical, unpredictable
and fascinating,

37:46.347 --> 37:48.975
and yours is, was,
and always will be boring!

37:49.475 --> 37:51.936
I forge my own path.
You know what's gonna happen to you?

37:52.019 --> 37:53.229
You're gonna go to UGA.

37:53.312 --> 37:55.606
You're gonna pledge
Alpha Gamma Bitch Face.

37:55.690 --> 37:56.732
Your hair will get blonder.

37:56.816 --> 37:58.526
You'll get married by 23

37:58.609 --> 37:59.986
and have babies by 25,

38:00.069 --> 38:03.114
have the exact same wallpaper
and the exact same life as Mom.

38:03.197 --> 38:04.282
You'll get back together with Luke

38:04.365 --> 38:06.242
because he's safe and feels like home

38:06.325 --> 38:08.995
and you don't have the guts
to take a chance on--

38:09.078 --> 38:10.830
You have no idea what kind of guts I have!

38:12.164 --> 38:12.999
Don't I, though?

38:14.500 --> 38:16.002
I'm hooking up with April!

38:18.504 --> 38:19.380
What?

38:19.463 --> 38:22.341
I wasn't there for you last night
because I was following my heart,

38:22.425 --> 38:24.468
and my heart was in my lips, and my hands,

38:24.552 --> 38:27.430
and other parts of me
that are none of your beeswax.

38:27.513 --> 38:30.516
I'm with April Stevens now
and she's a girl.

38:30.599 --> 38:32.184
How's that for boring?

38:38.899 --> 38:40.026
Yeah, that's right!

38:40.109 --> 38:42.194
Walk away and think about
your actions and your words!

38:43.904 --> 38:44.822
Oh, shoot, my gun.

38:48.576 --> 38:50.286
-[alarm rings]
-Oh, we got action.

38:53.539 --> 38:55.624
-That Swedish meatball is going down.
-Yeah.

38:55.708 --> 38:57.543
[cell phone rings]

39:01.881 --> 39:03.215
Hey, I'm kind of busy right now,

39:03.299 --> 39:05.217
but I definitely want to know
where the hell you been all day.

39:05.843 --> 39:08.054
-Hey, man. Focus up.
-Yeah. I gotta call you back.

39:08.137 --> 39:09.096
Bowser.

39:10.806 --> 39:13.976
Hey, hey, hey. Baby girl, everything okay?

39:14.393 --> 39:15.770
-Sterling...
-Sterling what?

39:16.103 --> 39:16.979
Is she all right?

39:17.980 --> 39:18.981
Bowser, hello!

39:19.065 --> 39:20.274
We got into a fight.

39:21.275 --> 39:23.361
Please, I don't know who else to talk to.

39:25.404 --> 39:26.530
[Terrance] Hey, Bowser!

39:26.614 --> 39:28.032
[people screaming]

39:28.741 --> 39:30.993
No. Are you serious?

39:31.660 --> 39:33.496
All right, tell me what happened.

39:33.829 --> 39:35.039
Sterling hates me.

39:35.122 --> 39:36.457
There's the little bastard.

39:36.540 --> 39:38.334
And I think I hate her, too.

39:39.251 --> 39:41.253
No. You two don't hate each other.

39:41.504 --> 39:43.005
She had all these secrets.

39:43.089 --> 39:44.507
We don't have secrets.

39:44.590 --> 39:46.801
And because of her,
Miles broke up with me,

39:46.884 --> 39:48.969
and did I mention she wasn't there for me?

39:49.053 --> 39:50.346
[groans] I'm sorry to hear that.

39:50.971 --> 39:54.600
And now she thinks I'm an asshole,
but she's the asshole.

39:55.017 --> 39:57.478
You're kind of both assholes
if you ask me.

39:57.561 --> 39:58.396
That's not funny.

39:58.479 --> 40:00.523
-But I'm sure she didn't mean it.
-[people shouting]

40:00.606 --> 40:02.900
No, I think she meant it.

40:03.192 --> 40:06.487
No. Sometimes we say things that
we don't mean,

40:07.196 --> 40:09.782
especially with... siblings. You know.

40:09.865 --> 40:12.743
She said
a lot of pretty intense stuff to me.

40:13.285 --> 40:14.245
Did she?

40:14.328 --> 40:16.080
Well what about you? What'd you say?

40:16.163 --> 40:18.040
Well, I said some stuff, too, but...

40:18.124 --> 40:19.083
I'm angry.

40:19.166 --> 40:20.376
Yeah, well, sometimes...

40:21.043 --> 40:23.295
Sometimes we say things out loud

40:23.379 --> 40:24.588
just to get them off our chest,

40:24.672 --> 40:26.674
to get 'em out of our system, you know?

40:27.466 --> 40:28.592
This is bullshit.

40:29.009 --> 40:30.136
I know.

40:30.719 --> 40:32.721
You just gotta let that happen, you know,

40:34.765 --> 40:36.725
it's going to be better.
It's going to get better.

40:41.063 --> 40:43.899
Hey, truant.
You missed a pop quiz in Spanish today.

40:44.191 --> 40:45.609
Un examen sorpresa.

40:46.068 --> 40:48.237
But I'm sure she'll let you make it up,
Carolina.

40:50.614 --> 40:51.740
What's the matter? You look upset?

40:52.241 --> 40:53.242
Where are you?

40:54.368 --> 40:55.411
I told Blair.

40:58.622 --> 41:01.709
And she embraced you
with love in her heart

41:01.792 --> 41:05.504
and said she supports us fully
and is so happy for us, right?

41:05.588 --> 41:06.964
Yeah, it's like you were there.

41:10.593 --> 41:11.427
What happened?

41:11.510 --> 41:13.888
[sighs] We were having a huge fight
about other things

41:13.971 --> 41:15.139
and then in the middle of it,

41:15.222 --> 41:16.891
I blurted out that you and I were together

41:16.974 --> 41:18.434
like I was spitting acid in her face,

41:18.517 --> 41:19.894
and now we're not speaking,

41:19.977 --> 41:21.937
and I don't know how
we're going to make it better.

41:22.021 --> 41:24.648
Oh. Come on. She's your sister.

41:24.732 --> 41:28.152
You two are bizarrely
and often upsettingly close.

41:28.777 --> 41:29.904
You'll mend fences.

41:30.362 --> 41:31.530
And now you've also got me.

41:32.865 --> 41:33.741
I've got you?

41:33.824 --> 41:36.494
And I've got... you.

41:37.703 --> 41:39.538
I can't wait to see you
at the lock-in tonight.

41:40.915 --> 41:41.916
I was thinking...

41:42.625 --> 41:45.419
Now that Blair knows,
maybe it's time everyone knows.

41:48.130 --> 41:49.006
Oh.

41:49.757 --> 41:51.967
And maybe tonight is a good time
to let the whole world know

41:52.051 --> 41:54.053
that you and I are us...

41:54.762 --> 41:55.679
or we.

41:56.347 --> 41:58.265
We are you and me, but together.

41:58.724 --> 42:00.935
Nothing crazy.
We could hold hands or something...

42:01.435 --> 42:03.562
or sleep side by side.

42:05.648 --> 42:06.482
I guess...

42:07.816 --> 42:09.568
sleeping side by side...

42:10.611 --> 42:11.779
could be nice.

42:13.822 --> 42:15.491
