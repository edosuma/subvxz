WEBVTT

00:40.807 --> 00:43.075
- Grandpa Klaus!
- I just came by...

00:43.076 --> 00:45.811
to tell you one of
my funny bedtime stories.

00:45.812 --> 00:48.812
Oh, tell me the one about how people
used to believe in the Bible.

00:48.982 --> 00:51.982
Another time.
No, this is the tale of Stan Smith...

00:54.054 --> 00:57.054
a man with a winter secret.

00:59.426 --> 01:02.426
Ah, Saturday- Sunday's Friday.

01:02.662 --> 01:05.431
Let's pack a picnic and go
shoot rats in the junkyard.

01:05.432 --> 01:08.432
Sounds great!
And afterwards we can stop by the-

01:09.035 --> 01:11.036
Stan, are you okay?

01:12.906 --> 01:15.906
There it was. She knew exactly what it meant.

01:17.310 --> 01:19.545
From the first snowflake
to the first thaw...

01:19.546 --> 01:22.546
Stan would become a loof,
withdrawn, mysterious.

01:23.850 --> 01:26.785
Oh, Stan.
Can't this year be different?

01:26.786 --> 01:29.786
No! I have to be alone.

01:34.794 --> 01:37.062
Francine cried and cried

01:37.063 --> 01:40.063
And so what was a season of joy
for most couples...

01:41.568 --> 01:44.568
was a season of solitar despair
for poor Francine.

01:46.406 --> 01:49.406
Mmm.

01:50.143 --> 01:53.143
God, it's freezing in here!
Why is the door open?

01:53.279 --> 01:56.279
Oh, Hayley-kins, this snow
reminds me of my planet so.

01:57.417 --> 02:00.417
It's starting again. Your dad went out in the
middle of the night, and he hasn't come home.

02:02.088 --> 02:04.356
- Where do you think he goes?
- No idea.

02:04.357 --> 02:06.425
But ask me if I want a mimosa.

02:06.426 --> 02:09.425
That's a question I can answer.

02:09.963 --> 02:12.963
Oh, my God! Stan, you,re bleeding!
Where have you been?

02:13.199 --> 02:15.801
Sorry. That's for me to know
and you to find out.

02:15.802 --> 02:18.802
But I never want you to find out.
So it's just for me to know.

02:19.439 --> 02:22.439
Stan, I,m your wife. If something's wrong,
I want to help you.

02:23.243 --> 02:26.243
Oh. So by that logic, if something is right,
you,ll want to hinder me!

02:26.813 --> 02:29.114
Great, Francine.
Real quality "wifing....

02:29.115 --> 02:32.017
Okay, here's the shot.
You have to bounce the ball twice...

02:32.018 --> 02:35.018
and toss it accurately enough
to hit the netting or metal ring.

02:40.927 --> 02:43.495
That must be the Russian binoculars
we ordered!

02:43.496 --> 02:46.298
Package for Steve Smith.
Sign here.

02:46.299 --> 02:48.934
Wait. This crate is
way too big for binoculars.

02:48.935 --> 02:51.935
Oh, is it? I guess you know
a lot about crates.

02:51.938 --> 02:54.938
Hey, good news, Sid.
We got ourselves a regular crate expert.

02:55.441 --> 02:58.441
Little kid's gonna tell me all about crates.
Professor Crate over here.

02:58.845 --> 03:01.845
All right, all right.
I,ll sign.

03:02.882 --> 03:05.882
- He's right, you know.
You have been kind of a jerk...

03:06.286 --> 03:09.286
since you read that book about crates.

03:11.157 --> 03:14.157
Are you Steve, Toshi, Barry and Snot?

03:17.664 --> 03:20.664
- I am a Russian bride.
- These are the best binoculars ever!

03:22.202 --> 03:25.202
Wait. Someone accidentally
ordered a woman in the mail?

03:25.738 --> 03:28.738
- Grandpa, is this the same story?
- No, it is a little side story.

03:29.676 --> 03:32.676
I,m using it to break up the main story
so you don't get bored.

03:33.179 --> 03:36.014
- Are we part of the story, Grandpa?
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

03:36.015 --> 03:38.217
No, we are a framing device.

03:38.218 --> 03:41.218
Anyway, Francine's curiosity
finally got the best of her.

03:42.956 --> 03:45.956
She had to uncover Stan's secret.

03:50.296 --> 03:53.296
Stan?

03:59.672 --> 04:02.672
I must be losing it.

04:03.443 --> 04:05.677
Mmm.

04:05.678 --> 04:08.678
Password accepted

04:23.830 --> 04:26.830
Maria! I just thought you quit
without giving notice.

04:38.378 --> 04:40.912
- Oh!
- Stop, maiden woman.

04:40.913 --> 04:43.913
No further shall you venture
without the password.

04:47.854 --> 04:50.155
What in God's name is wrong with you?

04:50.156 --> 04:53.058
- I thought that was the password.
- It's not a word!

04:53.059 --> 04:55.594
It's a terrible,
terrible abomination!

04:55.595 --> 04:58.595
Oh, I,m so sorry. It's just-
See, I,m Stan's wife, and he-

05:00.433 --> 05:02.901
Oh, you,re Francine!

05:02.902 --> 05:05.902
I,m Clifford. Stan hired me
to guard this passage.

05:06.939 --> 05:09.308
Yes, I,ve been down here quite a while.

05:09.309 --> 05:11.843
He owes me something like $42,000.

05:11.844 --> 05:14.844
He said he's putting it
into an account for me. Is that, um-

05:15.715 --> 05:18.715
- Is that true?
- Oh, we don't discuss finances. I just make the dinner.

05:19.852 --> 05:22.852
Oh, no, no, no, no. It's fine.
It's fine. I,m sure he's good for it.

05:23.456 --> 05:25.657
It's just my girlfriend
wanted me to say something...

05:25.658 --> 05:27.893
,cause we,re trying to get
a place together and-

05:27.894 --> 05:30.894
and, you know,
move out of this tunnel.

05:31.197 --> 05:34.197
Um, yeah. If you just keep going down
the- the way you,re going.

05:34.934 --> 05:37.934
Exactly.

05:41.641 --> 05:44.641
Francine followed her husband-
- He's a superhero?

05:45.478 --> 05:48.478
You know, every time you interrupt someone,
your penis gets a little shorter.

05:50.316 --> 05:53.316
Francine followed her husband
at a safe distance.

05:53.820 --> 05:56.820
But nothing could have prepared her
for what she was about to see.

06:09.302 --> 06:11.370
My God!

06:11.371 --> 06:14.371
He's a figure skater!

06:20.380 --> 06:22.948
Ooh!

06:22.949 --> 06:25.949
- You,ve been sneaking out
for the last 20 winters to ice-skate?

06:26.686 --> 06:28.754
How come you never told me?

06:28.755 --> 06:31.755
- How can you tell someone you love you,re a monster?
- I don't understand.

06:33.826 --> 06:36.826
Francine, a long time ago,
I hurt someone.

06:36.963 --> 06:39.598
I hurt her very, very badly.

06:39.599 --> 06:42.434
We were competing in
the Southeast Figure Skating Regionals.

06:42.435 --> 06:45.404
My partner wasn't as
strong as kater as I was...

06:45.405 --> 06:48.405
but it was the regionals
and I wanted to win more than anything.

06:49.008 --> 06:51.076
I had to pull out all the stops.

06:54.647 --> 06:57.215
You suck!

06:57.216 --> 06:59.418
She never skated again.

06:59.419 --> 07:02.120
Oh, God, Stan.
That's horrible.

07:02.121 --> 07:05.121
But it was an accident.
That doesn't make you a monster.

07:05.892 --> 07:08.892
Having bulbous eyes and leathery skin
and scary teeth makes you a monster.

07:11.664 --> 07:14.664
- Brett Butler is a monster.
- I am a monster, Francine!

07:15.034 --> 07:18.034
Winning was more important to me
than my own partner's safety.

07:18.104 --> 07:21.104
Since that terrible day, I,ve been damned
to skate with the only partner I deserve-

07:22.408 --> 07:24.409
loneliness.

07:24.410 --> 07:26.745
Well, I,ll skate with you.
It,ll be fun.

07:26.746 --> 07:29.746
Fun? Does it look like fun
to speed and twirl about the ice...

07:30.416 --> 07:32.984
to your favorite song
in a magnificent costume?

07:32.985 --> 07:35.985
- Well, yeah. Actually, it does.
- I envy your innocence.

07:37.056 --> 07:40.056
Come on, Stan! Let me show you
how much fun ice-skating can be!

07:41.027 --> 07:44.027
It's too dangerous. I couldn't live
with myself if I hurt you.

07:44.163 --> 07:47.163
You won't hurt me! Come on.
Isn't it time we spent one winter together?

07:49.135 --> 07:52.135
Well-All right, let's do it!

07:52.405 --> 07:55.405
First thing we,ll need to do
is raise $80 to buy you a costume.

07:55.675 --> 07:58.675
- We could put on a show or raffle
off a microwave or- - But I have $80.

07:59.712 --> 08:02.380
Oh. Okay then.

08:02.381 --> 08:05.381
And so Francine
nursed Stan's wounded soul back to life.

08:07.119 --> 08:10.119
Little by little, with love and support.
she made skating fun for Stan.

08:12.158 --> 08:15.158
It was their first real winter together,
and she was truly happy

08:22.268 --> 08:25.170
Having a Russian bride
sure has its advantages.

08:25.171 --> 08:28.171
I,ll say! Now that Coach
saw me with Svetlana...

08:28.407 --> 08:31.407
maybe he,ll finally believe I,m heterosexual
and let me towel myself off.

08:32.778 --> 08:35.778
Steve, I noticed you weren't rooting
through my garbage this morning.

08:35.881 --> 08:38.881
That was the old me, Lacey.
Now that I have Svetlana...

08:38.951 --> 08:41.951
your discarded Q-tips have lost their allure.

08:42.188 --> 08:45.188
Thanks to Francine,
Stan was no longer haunted by his past...

08:47.059 --> 08:50.059
which made life better for him
and everyone around him.

08:50.997 --> 08:53.997
Klaus, your scales are
especially shiny today, my friend.

08:54.267 --> 08:56.034
Thank you for noticing.

08:56.035 --> 08:58.770
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You were a fish?

08:58.771 --> 09:01.771
Oh, yeah, that.
But Stan, he was a new man, and he-

09:04.010 --> 09:07.010
Hold on a second.
You were a fish.

09:07.246 --> 09:10.215
Don't you think that's a better story
than two grown-ups ice-skating?

09:10.216 --> 09:13.216
I was also roommates with Rick Schroder.
You want to hear about that?

09:13.252 --> 09:16.252
- Yeah!
- Okay.

09:16.956 --> 09:19.858
Rick Schroder sucks.
Hejust- He-

09:19.859 --> 09:22.859
Hejust sucks.
He sucks so hard.

09:22.862 --> 09:25.862
Rick Schroder uses women.
The end.

09:26.699 --> 09:29.367
Anyway, back to the skating story.

09:29.368 --> 09:31.770
Francine, wife order DirecTV now...

09:31.771 --> 09:34.339
we get The Tennis Channel
for just pennies a day!

09:34.340 --> 09:37.340
- And Shirley's standing by to help us!
- Forget it.

09:37.410 --> 09:40.410
Shirley?
What did you do?

09:41.280 --> 09:44.280
It's so nice to finally spend
a normal winter with my husband.

09:45.818 --> 09:48.818
I always thought people ice-skated
to escape their haunted pasts.

09:49.121 --> 09:52.121
But now I know it's just fun! That Peanuts
Christmas special finally makes sense.

09:53.526 --> 09:56.061
Snoopy wasn't running from
a painful memory.

09:56.062 --> 09:59.062
- He was just a happy dog on skates!
- I,m glad you feel that way...

09:59.832 --> 10:02.832
because I entered us in a little couples
competition down at the rink.

10:03.569 --> 10:05.637
It's gonna be so much fun!

10:05.638 --> 10:08.638
Yeah. Fun.

10:09.275 --> 10:12.275
Oh, Staniel, I know that look.
What's wrong, chief?

10:12.845 --> 10:15.513
- I can't skate in this competition.
- Oh, yeah.

10:15.514 --> 10:18.514
Francine told me all about your partner's injury.
But you,re past that.

10:19.018 --> 10:22.018
- I didn't tell her the whole story.
- No, of course not.

10:22.088 --> 10:24.155
No one ever does.

10:24.156 --> 10:27.156
My partner was down. But a little fall
wasn't going to destroy my dream.

10:27.960 --> 10:30.960
I knew if my partner had been the conscious one,
she would have done the same for me.

10:32.398 --> 10:34.966
I probably should have
taken her to the hospital..

10:34.967 --> 10:37.202
but I was so competitive
I couldn't accept we'd lost.

10:37.203 --> 10:39.904
So I drove us 90miles
to contest the results...

10:39.905 --> 10:42.641
with the National Figure
Skating Association.

10:42.642 --> 10:45.276
Hey! You,re not supposed
to fall asleep with a concussion.

10:45.277 --> 10:47.512
Here.
We can jam out to this.

10:47.513 --> 10:50.148
Warner Books On Tape presents...

10:50.149 --> 10:53.149
John Houseman reading
Elements of Style.

10:54.920 --> 10:56.988
Chapter One.

10:56.989 --> 10:59.989
Forming the possessive singular
of nouns...

11:01.127 --> 11:04.127
- by adding apostrophe "S "
- All right!

11:04.430 --> 11:07.430
But it was all for nothing.
The association refused to change our score.

11:09.001 --> 11:11.870
Wow, Stan, you have
a real problem with competition.

11:11.871 --> 11:14.105
There's no way
you can enter that contest.

11:14.106 --> 11:17.106
You,re right. I,m not gonna put my wife's life
in danger just for a set of wigs.

11:19.645 --> 11:22.580
- Come again?
- The prize is a lousy set of wigs.

11:22.581 --> 11:25.581
- The prize is a set of wigs?
- Yes.

11:25.751 --> 11:28.751
Wigs you,d probably just put in the attic
and never check on to see if anyone...

11:29.422 --> 11:32.422
were playing with them or borrowing them
to audition for the community theater?

11:32.491 --> 11:34.859
- Exactly.
- Stan, you,ve got to skate in this competition-

11:34.860 --> 11:36.861
for Francine.

11:36.862 --> 11:39.862
- She hasn't been this happy in ages.
- But y-you just said I shouldn't.

11:40.066 --> 11:43.066
That was a test! You failed!
God, you,re selfish!

11:43.269 --> 11:46.269
Bad Stan! Oh, oh, I meant to say,
"Bad Stan!... and then slapyou.

11:47.440 --> 11:50.440
Bad Stan! I don't know.
I like it both ways.

11:51.510 --> 11:54.510
And so Stan fought his competitive urges...

11:55.247 --> 11:58.247
as long as he could,
but it was a losing battle.

11:58.551 --> 12:00.785
And now give me an R.B.O. Choctaw!

12:00.786 --> 12:03.421
I,m sorry. Is that the one where-

12:03.422 --> 12:06.422
It's a simple footwork sequence going from
your right outer edge skating backward...

12:06.459 --> 12:08.526
to your left inner edge
skating forward!

12:08.527 --> 12:11.527
Damn it, Francine! What's so hard about
doing it flawlessly the first time?

12:12.064 --> 12:15.064
She's as graceful as a frozen turd.

12:16.869 --> 12:19.869
Don't worry, babies.
Help is on the way.

12:22.675 --> 12:25.675
Can you guys believe it?
We,re about to skinny-dip with Svetlana.

12:27.780 --> 12:30.780
- I,ve never seen a naked woman before.
- There's no shame in that, Snot.

12:31.350 --> 12:34.350
In fact, now that we,re about to see one,
I can admit that my story...

12:35.154 --> 12:37.956
about the naked lady
who drove me home from the library...

12:37.957 --> 12:40.957
was not entirely true.

12:43.262 --> 12:46.262
Boys are ready?

12:46.999 --> 12:49.901
I,m naked!

12:51.036 --> 12:53.505
Come on, Sveti!
Ditch the suit!

12:53.506 --> 12:56.506
Marriage is business contract.
I must protect my interests.

12:56.642 --> 12:59.410
- Where did you hear that garbage?
- It'snot garbage

12:59.411 --> 13:02.411
I found her living in your closet, Steve.
She's a Russian bride, not a Russian whore.

13:03.983 --> 13:06.417
She doesn't have to act like a whore
until one of you marries her.

13:06.418 --> 13:08.453
But you,re not married,
and you,re a total whore!

13:08.454 --> 13:11.454
That's because
I was born in America!

13:11.791 --> 13:14.425
Well, there's only one way
to settle this.

13:14.426 --> 13:17.426
Whoever holds his breath longest
gets to marry her.

13:27.640 --> 13:30.640
Well, Snot wins.
I guess hejust wanted it more.

13:36.849 --> 13:39.849
At this part of our routine, I want you
to do a salchow from a Mohawk entry.

13:40.586 --> 13:43.054
- Is that something I can even do?
- Sure it is. Watch.

13:45.191 --> 13:47.225
Ow!

13:47.226 --> 13:49.294
- Can we take five?
- Take five?

13:49.295 --> 13:52.295
Maybe you should take the whole afternoon.
Maybe you should take a whole lifetime.

13:52.565 --> 13:55.565
,Cause that's how long it takes
to grow the guts figure-skating demands!

13:55.835 --> 13:58.069
God, Stan!
It's not the Olympics.

13:58.070 --> 14:00.371
Wait. Is it?

14:03.776 --> 14:05.844
No, it's not.

14:05.845 --> 14:08.146
What am I doing?
This is a friendly competition.

14:08.147 --> 14:10.615
It's not about winning.
It's all about fun.

14:10.616 --> 14:12.684
We,re gonna take
first place for sure.

14:12.685 --> 14:15.019
Oh, there it is.
It just became about winning again.

14:15.020 --> 14:18.020
We don't have a chance!

14:24.563 --> 14:27.563
You,re-You,re magnificent.

14:27.900 --> 14:30.869
- Hello.
- Roger!

14:30.870 --> 14:33.605
- Where did you learn to skate?
- On my planet.

14:33.606 --> 14:35.907
You really haven't read
my My Space page, have you?

14:35.908 --> 14:38.142
You say you have,
but you really haven't.

14:38.143 --> 14:41.143
Look, if you skate with me, we can't lose.
How about it, partner?

14:42.715 --> 14:45.715
Help me up, Stan.

14:49.288 --> 14:52.288
Okay She's just gonna sit there.
That's okay This is her issue, her drama.

14:53.392 --> 14:56.392
Okay we'remaking the turn. We're heading back.
just stay focused Don't look at her.

14:56.962 --> 14:59.962
Oh, should I trip over her?
Would that be funny? Or would that be mean?

15:00.432 --> 15:02.667
Funny or mean?
Funny or mean?Stan?

15:02.668 --> 15:05.668
Oh, too late!
We passed her.

15:09.541 --> 15:12.541
This is the first time in 20 winters
we,ve done anything together!

15:13.545 --> 15:16.545
And now you,re dumping me
to skate with Roger? Why, Stan? Why?

15:18.284 --> 15:20.818
- Well, honey, I-
- I,ll tell you why!

15:20.819 --> 15:23.819
Because winning some stupid contest
means more to you than your own wife!

15:24.623 --> 15:27.623
Yes, thank you. That would have
sounded awful coming out of my mouth.

15:28.460 --> 15:31.162
Well, now that's settled,
how about we watch some skating tapes?

15:31.163 --> 15:34.163
I,ve got Hartshorn and Sweiding debuting
their "Mustang Sally... routine in Berlin.

15:35.834 --> 15:38.169
God, really?
Hey, how's the slow motion on your machine?

15:38.170 --> 15:40.238
,Cause we could watch it
in our bedroom.

15:40.239 --> 15:43.239
I don't really like to use slo-mo or pause it
or anything,,cause that's hard on the tape.

15:44.576 --> 15:47.576
- It's my only copy, and-
- Stop talking. I totally get it.

15:50.282 --> 15:53.282
Stan and Roger practived relentessly.

15:53.352 --> 15:55.420
But Stan was about to learn...

15:55.421 --> 15:58.421
that the wishy alien's passions for winning
was even greater than his own.

16:00.326 --> 16:03.326
Stop, stop, stop! You do know
the competition's tomorrow, don't you?

16:04.663 --> 16:07.065
- Yeah, of course.
- Okay. Okay, good.

16:07.066 --> 16:09.534
Then why are you
skating like a wiener?

16:09.535 --> 16:12.535
- Don't I do a salchow right there?
- You call that a salchow?

16:13.038 --> 16:15.673
It looks like you have
mad salchow disease!

16:15.674 --> 16:18.674
That's right. Your skating has
a spongiform encephalopathy, bitch!

16:20.446 --> 16:23.446
Ah, my beauties,
my tranquil beauties, calm me.

16:24.283 --> 16:27.283
More friend than hairpiece.
I thank you.

16:29.588 --> 16:32.588
Oh, great. Sliced it. Are you even there?

16:32.791 --> 16:35.791
Uh, Father?
Are you gonna marry us or what?

16:36.128 --> 16:38.363
Well, you did buy me
this bucket of balls.

16:38.364 --> 16:41.299
I can't believe I,m giving you away
on your wedding day.

16:41.300 --> 16:44.135
Oh, seems like just yesterday
you popped out of that box...

16:44.136 --> 16:46.437
and I was planning
to have sex with you.

16:49.942 --> 16:52.942
Baby, you,re gonna shine tonight-
shine the stars down from heaven.

16:53.879 --> 16:56.879
- Roger, we,re on in five. Ready?
- I was born ready.

16:57.016 --> 16:59.584
My eyelashes, alas, were not.

16:59.585 --> 17:01.652
- There. How do I look?
- Great.

17:01.653 --> 17:04.653
Let's check out our competition.

17:07.126 --> 17:10.126
Ha! She fell,cause she was trying to hold up
her husband. Smooth move, doofus!

17:13.265 --> 17:16.265
- Well, it doesn't look like
it's dampening their spirits.

17:17.002 --> 17:19.404
That's because they
practically are spirits.

17:19.405 --> 17:22.405
Mmm.

17:22.808 --> 17:25.808
Hey, losers! Die already!
Earth belongs to the young!

17:26.912 --> 17:29.912
Hey! Maybe the score
is not important to them!

17:30.082 --> 17:33.082
Maybe being there
for each other is what counts.

17:33.652 --> 17:36.220
- I can't skate with you, Roger.
- What are you talking about?

17:36.221 --> 17:38.389
I want to skate with Francine.

17:38.390 --> 17:41.192
You can't do this to me!
You can't leave me here!

17:41.193 --> 17:44.095
Everyone's looking!
Everyone's looking!

17:44.096 --> 17:47.065
Can you keep it down? Huh?
No one's looking at you.

17:47.066 --> 17:50.001
We,re trying to watch
the skating here.

17:50.002 --> 17:53.002
Everyone's looking!

18:05.417 --> 18:08.417
I,m coming for you, Francine!

18:16.261 --> 18:18.563
Hey, buddy.
You want to ride inside the bus?

18:18.564 --> 18:21.564
There's no time!

18:23.802 --> 18:26.802
I,m coming for you, Francine!

18:29.975 --> 18:32.310
I,ll try C-9.

18:32.311 --> 18:34.312
- Miss.
- Hey, wow!

18:34.313 --> 18:37.313
If you sink my battleship, I should have
to take off a piece of armor!

18:38.550 --> 18:41.486
- We,re not playing strip Battleship.
- Of course we,re not. No, no.

18:41.487 --> 18:43.588
Francine!I've been a fool!

18:43.589 --> 18:46.589
- Please, skate with me.
- Forget it, Stan. I,m tired of feeling abandoned.

18:48.427 --> 18:51.427
Darling, I,ve changed.
Let me show you how much I care about you.

18:51.697 --> 18:54.697
- No way.
- Clifford, take her down with a tranq.

18:55.601 --> 18:58.601
You know, she was trying to get me to play
strip Battleship. I said no!

19:00.506 --> 19:03.506
Okay, do you, Snot,
take Svetlana to be your wife?

19:03.976 --> 19:06.976
- I do.
- Swell. Do you, Svetlana, take Snot to be your-

19:07.779 --> 19:10.779
You speak Russian?

19:32.604 --> 19:34.672
Nyet.

19:34.673 --> 19:36.841
Mmm!

19:36.842 --> 19:39.842
Now skating heir
Mamma Mia! fantasy Stan and Francine Smith

19:43.115 --> 19:45.416
Honey, wake up. We,re at the ice rink.

19:45.417 --> 19:48.417
- My casserole?
- No, honey. We,re skating together in a contest.

19:48.787 --> 19:51.787
- But it's just for fun, so I can show you I love you.
- Bastard!

19:55.360 --> 19:58.360
Come on, honey. I just wanted to show you that
you,re more important to me than winning.

19:58.897 --> 20:01.632
- Wait. So he's skating with Roger?
- No.

20:01.633 --> 20:03.935
- He's skating with Francine.
- When did that happen?

20:03.936 --> 20:06.837
- When you went to the bathroom.
- You didn't stop telling the story..

20:06.838 --> 20:09.507
- when I was in the bathroom?
- I told you not to go

20:09.508 --> 20:11.576
And I told you to light a match.

20:11.577 --> 20:14.577
How does a boy this small
make a smell that large?

20:14.947 --> 20:17.947
I,m sorry for abandoning you, Francine.
And I don't just mean this competition.

20:18.517 --> 20:21.517
- Huh?
- I mean, for all those winters I left you alone.

20:21.687 --> 20:24.555
Hmm.

20:24.556 --> 20:27.556
- All I want is to be with you, Stan.
- That's all I want too.

20:28.060 --> 20:31.060
I don't care if I,m a loser
every day for the rest of my life...

20:31.230 --> 20:34.165
just as long as
I get to lose with you.

20:34.166 --> 20:37.166
- Come on. Let's go home.
- Don't you want to see our scores?

20:37.936 --> 20:40.771
- Who cares? I already won.
- Mmm.

20:40.772 --> 20:43.772
That was my song!
The masses should be cheering for me!

20:43.909 --> 20:46.909
Damn it, this isn't over!
Not by a long shot!

20:48.947 --> 20:51.716
- You won, Roger?
- Of course. I,m the best.

20:51.717 --> 20:53.784
How,d you find a partner?

20:53.785 --> 20:56.785
Ow! Why? Why?

21:00.659 --> 21:03.494
Greg, keep your head up,
for God's sake!

21:03.495 --> 21:06.495
And they all lived
happily ever after.

21:07.733 --> 21:10.733
Hey Grandpa.
Were you ever a shark?

21:10.969 --> 21:13.969
Yes!I was two sharks and a monkey!
Now shut up and go to bed!
