00:47.681 --> 00:51.384
- You went without me.
- You wouldn't get up.

00:51.418 --> 00:54.353
- Because it was nighttime.
- It was 0430.

00:54.421 --> 00:56.289
Yeah. In Boston, we
call that "nighttime."

00:56.323 --> 00:58.424
[both chuckle] Good morning.

00:58.459 --> 01:00.126
- Mm.
- Mm.

01:00.160 --> 01:03.830
- How far did you go?
- I went to the, uh, B.B. bridge.

01:04.063 --> 01:07.233
You went 12 miles?
Are you supposed to do that?

01:07.267 --> 01:09.836
Sure. Why not? Me and my
braces have made peace.

01:09.870 --> 01:13.539
Can you leave those on?
They're so hot. [laughs]

01:13.607 --> 01:15.808
Don't. I-I'm sweaty.

01:15.843 --> 01:19.212
Mm.

01:19.279 --> 01:20.246
I love you.

01:23.116 --> 01:25.751
- Wow.
- Well, I say it to you in my head.

01:25.786 --> 01:28.398
I guess it was time to say it out loud.

01:28.433 --> 01:30.623
That sounds so bizarre when we say it.

01:31.625 --> 01:35.294
[both laugh]

01:35.362 --> 01:38.498
So which one of us is gonna say "uncle"?

01:38.532 --> 01:40.333
[sighs]

01:40.367 --> 01:43.569
Yeah, there doesn't seem to
be a way around it, does there?

01:43.604 --> 01:45.438
One of us has to be a house-spouse.

01:45.472 --> 01:48.274
Hmm.

01:48.342 --> 01:49.842
Why is it so complicated?

01:49.877 --> 01:52.778
Don't stress.
They've extended my leave.

01:52.813 --> 01:54.413
We have two more weeks
to think about it.

- Yes! Perfect timing!</i>

02:01.555 --> 02:03.389
We were hoping to have an orgy,

02:03.423 --> 02:05.391
and then we realized we
were one person short.

02:05.425 --> 02:06.792
- Ha.
- Hey, Maura.

02:06.827 --> 02:09.395
Hi. Uh, you still want
to run to Boston joe's?

02:10.631 --> 02:14.167
- Go. I know you hate my army coffee.
- I'm sorry.

02:14.201 --> 02:16.262
[sighs] Get out of here.

02:16.403 --> 02:19.238

03:59.840 --> 04:01.507
Well, if he has to leave the army

or I have to quit my job,
I can assure you both of us

04:04.778 --> 04:08.614

anxious and depressed.

04:08.649 --> 04:11.550
Okay.

- Maura: Are you helping Neda?

04:17.624 --> 04:19.925
Or just flirting? [laughs]

- Thank you.

04:26.733 --> 04:28.501
Thanks for being so nice to her.

04:28.535 --> 04:30.536
She worries every time she sees you.

04:30.570 --> 04:32.577
Why? Because she called me
a "bitch" the first time she met me?

04:32.706 --> 04:34.840
[laughing]
I've already forgotten it.

04:34.875 --> 04:36.809
You know what? In fairness
to Neda, she did think

04:36.810 --> 04:38.744
that you threw your hot
coffee on a stranger.

04:38.779 --> 04:40.446
See?

04:40.514 --> 04:41.847
- Your mom is so great, Jane.
- How do you know my mom?

04:41.882 --> 04:44.817
Don't tell me she's cheating
on her espresso machine

04:44.851 --> 04:46.452
and buying her coffee here.

04:46.486 --> 04:48.788
[laughs] No, I met her
at the Division One cafÃ©.

04:48.822 --> 04:51.924
Angela is letting Neda use it
as a model for her master's thesis.

04:51.958 --> 04:53.959
- Oh? What's your thesis?
- It's a business plan to turn

04:53.994 --> 04:57.563
Angela's drinks anhealy
homemade food into a chain.

04:57.597 --> 04:59.632
Maybe Ma will make it rich after all.

04:59.666 --> 05:01.767
- [laughs] Well, it's all theoretical.
- No, it isn't.

05:01.802 --> 05:04.337
You've been helping her integrate
more vegan recipes into her menu.

05:04.371 --> 05:06.472
What? No. 
Don't do that. [laughter]

back to my place so we can change?

05:13.447 --> 05:14.447
Sure thing.

05:14.514 --> 05:15.614
- Thanks, Neda.
- Thank you.

05:16.983 --> 05:18.017
See you later.

05:21.555 --> 05:23.522
Okay, this is a weird one.

05:23.557 --> 05:25.658
Well, let's start with
introductions. Who's that?

05:25.692 --> 05:29.395
Abraham Reynolds.
Lived right over there.

05:29.429 --> 05:32.531
- He died being a good samaritan.
- What happened?

05:32.566 --> 05:33.799
<i>10-year-ol named
Zack says a man</i>

05:33.834 --> 05:35.568
tried to grab him and
force him into a car.

05:35.602 --> 05:38.337
Reynolds saw it, jumped in
to try to rescue the kid.

05:38.372 --> 05:40.740
He appears to have suffered
a subdural hematoma.

05:40.774 --> 05:43.676
- Did the boy describe the kidnapper?
- He said it was a clown.

05:46.413 --> 05:47.880
What is it?

05:47.914 --> 05:50.383
<i>In 1988, a 10-year-old
boy was abducted by a clown</i>

05:50.417 --> 05:52.785
- on his way home from school.
- Nick Hamilton.

05:52.819 --> 05:54.754
I'll never forget it. I was 12.

05:54.788 --> 05:56.489
Ma wouldn't let us go
anywhere for months.

05:56.556 --> 05:57.890
We called it the "summer of the clown."

05:57.924 --> 05:59.959
I was still in uniform.
It was a bad time.

06:00.026 --> 06:01.794
Well, what happened to Nick?

06:01.862 --> 06:03.796
Never found him ... or the clown.

06:03.864 --> 06:05.798
- A random clown kidnapped a kid?
- No. No. No.

06:05.832 --> 06:07.717
There were three
attempted kidnappings on

06:07.718 --> 06:09.602
young boys before the
clown grabbed Nick.

06:09.636 --> 06:10.836
I never liked clowns.

06:10.871 --> 06:14.573
Coulrophobia ... fear of clowns.
A recent study has confirmed

06:14.608 --> 06:16.876
that clowns are disliked
by most children.

06:16.910 --> 06:20.079
- What do we know about this clown?
- Said his name was "Brent"

06:20.147 --> 06:21.914
And he was headed for his
job at a clown car wash.

06:21.982 --> 06:24.417
As far as I know, there are
no clown car washes in Boston.

06:24.451 --> 06:25.718
Frost, can you do a search?

06:25.752 --> 06:29.155
- Yeah, sure.
- Oh, he's holding something.

06:30.123 --> 06:34.627
- Satin polyester trim.
- Yellow. Shiny.

06:34.661 --> 06:36.629
Looks like something a clown would wear.

06:36.663 --> 06:39.465
No clown motifs on any
businesses near here,

06:39.533 --> 06:42.868
- including car washes.
- Korsak: They found something.

06:42.903 --> 06:46.105
Yeah. 
Looks like a petal, maybe?

06:46.139 --> 06:50.409
<i>Yeah, it's a piece of a plastic flower.</i>

06:50.477 --> 06:52.611
We might have a footprint here.

06:54.047 --> 06:57.516
Yep. Clown shoe. Big one.

06:57.551 --> 06:59.084
All right, let's have CSRU get here

06:59.119 --> 07:02.274
- and make a cast impression.
- I'm not liking this.

07:03.890 --> 07:05.558
Me, either.

07:05.592 --> 07:07.726
[sighs]

07:13.900 --> 07:17.436
Tell me our poor, dead samaritan
managed to scratch the clown.

07:17.471 --> 07:19.104
I'm not sure I have any skin cells yet,

07:19.172 --> 07:22.842
but there's a beige, powdery
substance under his index finger.

07:22.876 --> 07:24.610
We need the killer's skin, Maura.

07:24.678 --> 07:26.612
- He had a pre-existing condition.
- Wait, no! Don't stop!

07:26.680 --> 07:28.714
We could get lucky and
get the killer's DNA.

07:28.748 --> 07:31.684
"Hold your horses."
Homer said that to Antilochus

07:31.718 --> 07:33.686
to get him to stop driving
his chariot like a maniac.

07:33.720 --> 07:36.021
Aha. I had always wondered.

07:36.056 --> 07:39.225
See this? It's an aneurysm.

07:40.861 --> 07:44.069
What, it burst when his
skull struck the curb? 

07:44.104 --> 07:45.764
- Yes.
- Anything on the plastic flower?

07:45.799 --> 07:47.900
Uh, we did a headspace analysis.

07:47.934 --> 07:51.170
I'd like a headspace analysis.
It would help me figure out

07:51.204 --> 07:52.872
<i>if I'm going to marry
the love of my life,</i>

07:52.906 --> 07:55.241
or stay here and solve murders
and become an old cat lady.

07:55.275 --> 07:58.511
You'll never be a cat lady.
You'll be a dog lady.

07:58.545 --> 08:01.046
- Phew.
- Are you having lunch with Casey?

08:01.081 --> 08:02.982
Wha... only if you talk faster
about the plastic flower.

08:03.049 --> 08:04.884
It has volatile organic chemical levels

08:04.918 --> 08:07.686
- close to 1,000 parts per million.
- Even faster.

08:07.721 --> 08:10.055
The FDA hasn't allowed
levels over 500 since 1990.

08:10.090 --> 08:11.123
[both chuckle]

08:11.157 --> 08:15.961
Wait, since 1990...
that means...

08:16.029 --> 08:17.930
the flower was probably
manufactured in the '80s.

08:17.964 --> 08:19.565
Don't cancel your lunch.

08:19.599 --> 08:23.102
I-I-I'm not. I'm ordering
files from the archives.

08:23.169 --> 08:25.738
If the costume our killer
was wearing is from the '80s,

08:25.772 --> 08:28.674
maybe there's a connection
to that '88 kidnapping.

08:30.744 --> 08:33.578
Jane asked me to bring up
all the incident reports.

08:33.613 --> 08:35.114
Put them over there.

08:35.148 --> 08:37.716
Okay, but you're gonna
need a bigger squad room.

08:37.784 --> 08:39.684
There are hundreds of boxes down there.

08:39.719 --> 08:40.970
<i>Do you really want to go</i>

08:40.971 --> 08:44.723
through all the incident reports
from June, July, and August of '88?

08:44.758 --> 08:46.992
No. We really want you
to go through them all.

08:47.027 --> 08:49.128
Look for any reports
that mention a clown.

08:49.162 --> 08:50.629
Why would the clown be back?

08:50.664 --> 08:51.964
If you find it boring
going through old files,

08:52.032 --> 08:54.600
maybe Martinez has
something exciting to do.

08:54.634 --> 08:57.202
<i>Yeah, somebody's got to count
all those seized xanax pills.</i>

08:57.237 --> 08:59.171
Hey, Frankie, did you
ever notice how Frost

08:59.205 --> 09:00.940
can talk and work at the same time?

09:01.007 --> 09:03.576
<i>[sighs]
"Bats in the attic."</i>

09:03.610 --> 09:05.844
"Lost car keys."

09:05.879 --> 09:09.949
"My neighbor flashed his butt at me."
These aren't sorted.

09:09.983 --> 09:12.014
That's why you're here.

09:12.218 --> 09:14.753
<i>Did you find the three files
on the attempted kidnappings?</i>

09:14.788 --> 09:18.223
Yeah. They're right there.
I also found the missing-persons files.

09:19.893 --> 09:22.661
- Hmm.
- Ah, I remember that kid.

09:22.696 --> 09:25.197
His face was everywhere,
even on milk cartons.

09:25.231 --> 09:26.899
Yeah, the only witness
to Nick's kidnapping

09:26.967 --> 09:29.735
was a housewife who saw
it from her kitchen window.

09:29.769 --> 09:31.170
- "A housewife"?
- Are you gonna tell me the ladies

09:31.204 --> 09:33.172
like to be called "domestic engineers"?

09:33.206 --> 09:36.008
- "The ladies"?
- Oh, stop busting my balls.

09:36.042 --> 09:38.177
[chuckles] We got to set
up a separate tip line.

09:38.211 --> 09:40.212
I'll set one up in bric.

09:40.246 --> 09:42.881
Yeah, brace yourself. We had thousands
of false clown sightings in '88 ...

09:42.916 --> 09:45.951
<i>teenagers playing pranks,
parents flipping out.</i>

09:45.986 --> 09:47.086
Didn't help us find this boy.

09:47.120 --> 09:48.587
[computer beeps]

09:48.622 --> 09:50.389
Oh, the forensic artist
just finished with Zack.

09:50.423 --> 09:52.625
He was the only witness to the clown.

09:55.562 --> 09:58.998
Release it, although I doubt the bad guy

09:59.032 --> 10:01.909
is still wandering
around in his clown getup.

10:10.400 --> 10:12.434
<i>[children playing]
This is beautiful. </i>

10:12.468 --> 10:14.970
I never have a real lunch.

10:15.004 --> 10:16.572
Last time I was on a picnic,

10:16.606 --> 10:18.807
I was with my family
at Franklin Park zoo.

10:18.841 --> 10:21.577
And my father insisted on
fixing the water fountain

10:21.611 --> 10:22.978
and snapped the pipe.

10:23.012 --> 10:24.880
[chuckles] I hope it
was the marine section.

10:24.914 --> 10:26.882
No, it was the elephant section.

10:26.916 --> 10:29.785
[chuckles] Uh-oh.
What did the elephants do?

10:29.819 --> 10:31.253
They shot water at us.

10:31.287 --> 10:32.521
[both laugh]

10:32.555 --> 10:35.390
I know you, uh ... you hate to be away

10:35.425 --> 10:36.692
when you're in the
middle of a case, so...

10:36.726 --> 10:40.696
It makes me mad that some poor guy
trying to save a kid got murdered.

10:40.730 --> 10:42.564
[dog barking in distance]

10:44.901 --> 10:47.936
- Let's not talk work.
- It's okay. I want to support you.

10:48.004 --> 10:50.672
I support what you do.

10:52.609 --> 10:55.444
I want to do the same for you.

10:58.414 --> 11:02.517
Casey, I don't want to be
responsible for ruining your career.

11:02.552 --> 11:05.387
<i>You know, they want you to be a General.</i>

11:05.421 --> 11:07.823
Do you know how few people
get that opportunity?

11:07.857 --> 11:10.792
I feel the same way about
asking you to be an army wife.

11:10.860 --> 11:12.961
Your work's important,
and you're so good at it.

11:14.080 --> 11:15.631
So, what do we do?

11:15.665 --> 11:17.866
So, maybe it's time I
resigned my commission.

11:19.002 --> 11:22.270
If anyone was born to
be a leader, you are.

11:22.305 --> 11:27.342
- I googled you, you know.
- So you know about the sex change?

11:27.377 --> 11:29.011
[laughs] Shut up.

11:29.045 --> 11:31.980
<i>No. I know 
that you have a purple heart.</i>

11:32.015 --> 11:34.683
<i>I know that you have a
distinguished service cross.</i>

11:34.717 --> 11:38.320
And I know how you got those medals.

11:39.656 --> 11:43.625
Here. Put this on your finger.

11:43.660 --> 11:45.961
I want to see what size you wear.

11:45.995 --> 11:49.531
Okay.
All right.

11:49.599 --> 11:54.636
Well... let's hope you're a 7.

11:57.573 --> 12:01.143
- How did you know?
- I pay attention.

12:04.681 --> 12:07.949
I always thought
 I'd know what to say

12:07.984 --> 12:09.918
when the man I loved proposed to me.

12:13.589 --> 12:16.558
But I'm making you wait.
It's not fair.

12:16.592 --> 12:18.694
Sure, it is. 
We haven't figured it out yet.

12:18.728 --> 12:20.796
<i>Just...</i>

12:20.863 --> 12:23.331
just don't say anything.
Just wear it.

12:23.366 --> 12:25.434
<i>See how it feels.</i>

12:34.110 --> 12:36.578
I think my customers
are gonna be able to tell

12:36.612 --> 12:38.113
the meatballs aren't meat.

12:38.147 --> 12:40.482
You can taste the chickpeas.

12:40.516 --> 12:44.453
Maybe you can give them an upbeat name,
like "ciao, Italia meatballs."

12:44.487 --> 12:49.758
- You think that'll fool Jane?
- Uh, no. [laughs]

12:51.127 --> 12:53.095
[sighs]

12:53.129 --> 12:55.097
Is everything all right?

12:55.131 --> 12:57.966
No.
You ever get what you've wanted,

12:58.000 --> 12:59.668
and you're not sure you want it anymore?

12:59.702 --> 13:02.604
Uh, yes, positive-psychology
research suggests

13:02.638 --> 13:04.639
we should not only be
careful what we wish for

13:04.674 --> 13:06.575
but why we wish for it.

13:06.609 --> 13:09.611
I just got offered
the job of a lifetime.

13:09.679 --> 13:12.047
- Well, that's wonderful!
- In Beijing.

13:12.081 --> 13:15.083
Oh. That's... far.
[chuckles]

13:15.151 --> 13:16.718
What does Detective Frost say?

13:16.753 --> 13:19.121
[sighs]
I haven't told him yet.

13:19.188 --> 13:22.524
- What do you want to do?
- Take the job...

13:22.558 --> 13:25.894
- and stay in Boston with Barry.
- Those are mutually exclusive.

13:25.962 --> 13:27.863
[sighs]
I just wish I could have it all.

13:27.897 --> 13:32.400
- No one has it all.
- Do you... regret your choices?

13:32.435 --> 13:35.437
I mean, you're a, you know,
respected professional.

13:35.471 --> 13:36.505
You made it.

13:38.574 --> 13:41.777
Fulfilling your dreams
requires a lot of hard choices.

13:41.844 --> 13:43.478
You know, pain over a breakup will fade,

13:43.513 --> 13:47.983
but you need to ask whether
putting him before yourself

13:48.050 --> 13:50.652
is something that you will regret.

13:57.760 --> 14:01.096
Did you find anyone who
wears a size-25 clown shoe?

14:01.130 --> 14:04.766
Uh, no, but I did find skin cells
under the victim's fingernails.

14:04.801 --> 14:07.502
Looks like enough to give us
a DNA profile of his attacker.

14:07.537 --> 14:10.739
Hmm. What about the
beige, powdery stuff?

14:10.773 --> 14:12.107
Uh, we ran it through
the gas spectrometer.

14:12.175 --> 14:16.745
- It's paint.
- Paint? What, like clown face paint?

14:16.779 --> 14:18.847
Uh, no, like flexible latex paint.

14:18.881 --> 14:22.450
It's a mixture of rubber
cement, pigment, and naphtha.

14:22.485 --> 14:26.655
- What's naphtha?
- Highly volatile mixture of hydrocarbons.

14:26.689 --> 14:27.673
You gonna mention that

14:27.674 --> 14:30.091
diamond you're wearing,
or do I ignore it?

14:30.126 --> 14:33.461
You don't watch many
romantic comedies, do you?

14:33.496 --> 14:38.333
- I do not.
- Well, I'm supposed to get all

14:38.334 --> 14:42.637
giggly and girly
and you're supposed to squeal.

14:42.705 --> 14:44.973
Why would I squeal over

14:45.007 --> 14:47.542
a colorless, crystalline
form of pure carbon?

14:47.577 --> 14:49.778
You have to admit it's pretty.

14:51.614 --> 14:54.082
I just wanted to wear
it for a couple minutes.

14:54.116 --> 14:55.517
I don't want to think about
what it means. I just...

14:55.551 --> 14:58.186
Talk to me about the paint!

14:58.254 --> 15:00.822
Um...

15:00.857 --> 15:04.659
It was used on
a slush-molded latex mask.

15:04.694 --> 15:07.929
Okay, so, our good samaritan

15:07.964 --> 15:11.233
must have grabbed the killer
by his rubber clown mask.

15:11.267 --> 15:14.636
Can you trace the manufacturer?

15:14.704 --> 15:18.073
Lab techs are already working on it.

15:18.107 --> 15:20.775
So... you're leaving?

15:20.810 --> 15:26.178
What? No. No.
I didn't say "yes."

15:28.317 --> 15:32.053
Can you see yourself
as a General's wife?

15:33.656 --> 15:35.056
I mean ... [sighs]

15:35.091 --> 15:38.026
what if I leave behind my life here

15:38.094 --> 15:42.130
and we don't work out as a couple?
Or he leaves his?

15:42.164 --> 15:45.600
One of us has to ruin a
career for us to be together.

15:45.635 --> 15:48.570
It's... it's not fair.

15:48.604 --> 15:53.008
Well, if life were fair,
all 7 billion of us would have one shoe

15:53.075 --> 15:56.077
and a piece of cardboard to call "home."

15:57.331 --> 16:00.619
How are you gonna survive with one shoe?

16:01.350 --> 16:04.252
How will I survive
without my best friend?

16:04.287 --> 16:06.855
Maura.

16:08.925 --> 16:10.659
Wait! What are you doing?

16:10.693 --> 16:13.628
I think I have a foreign
body on my cornea.

16:13.663 --> 16:16.531
- Wait. Maura...
- No. No. I'm okay.

16:16.565 --> 16:18.700
[door opens]

16:20.803 --> 16:25.106
Dr. Isles.
Why would you do that?

16:25.141 --> 16:28.009
I'm ... I'm sorry, Detective.
Do what?

16:28.044 --> 16:31.146
Encourage my girlfriend
to move to China.

16:31.180 --> 16:34.532
I wasn't encouraging her.
I was simply being a sounding board.

16:34.570 --> 16:37.152
Really? 
"The pain over a breakup will fade.

16:37.186 --> 16:39.888
<i>The regret that you put
him before yourself won't."</i>

16:39.922 --> 16:43.591
[sighs] I'm so sorry. I ...

16:43.626 --> 16:45.927
T-that is out of context.
I-I didn't ...

16:45.962 --> 16:49.831
<i>She's leaving on Friday, thanks to you.</i>

16:52.768 --> 16:55.603
[sighs]

16:55.638 --> 16:58.173
[sighs] This isn't too bad.

16:58.207 --> 17:01.710
No. Shouldn't take us more
than a couple of years.

17:01.744 --> 17:05.946
- What is this pile?
- 213 clown sightings.

17:06.015 --> 17:08.583
We got hobo clowns, fast-food clowns,

17:08.617 --> 17:11.252
mimes, evil clowns, Bozo the clown.

17:11.319 --> 17:13.154
I must have taken a few
hundred of those myself.

17:13.189 --> 17:16.558
I can't believe all we have to go
on are 25-year-old incident reports.

17:16.625 --> 17:18.126
[box slams]

17:18.160 --> 17:19.761
What's the matter?

17:19.795 --> 17:22.595
- Nothing.
- Doesn't look like nothing.

17:22.630 --> 17:25.700
[cellphone vibrates]
[beeps]

17:25.768 --> 17:26.901
Sergeant Korsak.

17:28.270 --> 17:29.671
Yeah, where?

17:31.073 --> 17:32.807
Okay. [cellphone beeps]

17:32.842 --> 17:34.075
Kid was abducted by a clown
fitting our description.

17:34.110 --> 17:36.277
Grab Jane. Let's go.

17:36.312 --> 17:38.780
[siren wails]

17:38.814 --> 17:39.914
<i>Jane: Did you see what happened?</i>

17:39.949 --> 17:42.084
No, no ... I was making a delivery,
and I pulled over as soon

17:42.085 --> 17:44.319
as I saw this backpack
in the middle of the street.

17:44.353 --> 17:47.055
- We'll need to take that.
- The boy must have dropped it.

17:48.157 --> 17:52.193
- Please tell us everything you saw.
- I-it happened so fast.

17:52.261 --> 17:56.698
All I saw was the clown
driving away with a little boy.

17:56.732 --> 17:58.033
Can you describe the car?

17:58.067 --> 18:00.802
Uh...g-grey, maybe, o-or silver?

18:00.870 --> 18:03.138
A sedan? Compact? 
Station wagon?

18:03.172 --> 18:06.374
- Sedan, I think.
- Did you get a good look at the boy?

18:06.409 --> 18:07.876
Not really. He looked so frightened.

18:07.910 --> 18:09.310
I'm looking for my son.

18:09.345 --> 18:12.280
He should be home.
His bus stop is right here.

18:12.314 --> 18:13.314
[gasps]

18:13.349 --> 18:16.996
That's my son's.
That's Kevin's! [shudders]

18:17.017 --> 18:19.854
Okay, okay, um, do you have
any pictures of your son?

18:19.889 --> 18:21.723
They're ... they're ...
they're in my house.

18:21.757 --> 18:24.159
Okay. W-why don't we go to
your house and get them, okay?

18:24.193 --> 18:25.810
[breathing shakily]
Okay. Okay.

18:25.828 --> 18:27.796
I just ... I-I have to
call my husband first.

18:27.830 --> 18:29.647
[police radio chatter]

18:29.682 --> 18:30.782
We failed that kid.

18:30.850 --> 18:32.951
- No, we didn't.
- Yes, we did.

18:32.985 --> 18:35.120
We didn't catch the clown,
and now he has her little boy.

18:35.154 --> 18:37.462
- Jane.
- What?! I'm on a picnic

18:37.506 --> 18:40.722
with my boyfriend while the killer's
out looking for his next victim.

18:49.882 --> 18:51.719
<i>I have something. We've identified </i>

18:51.789 --> 18:53.684
the manufacturer of the mask
through the paint formula.

18:53.718 --> 18:57.555
It was made by Every Mask, Inc.,
and they went out of business in 1989.

18:57.589 --> 18:59.223
I'll start making calls,

18:59.291 --> 19:01.192
see if I can track down
someone who might have records.

19:01.226 --> 19:02.626
Something just came in on the tip line.

19:04.496 --> 19:06.063
What do you have?

19:06.098 --> 19:07.231
A text with a video link
came in on the tip line.

19:07.265 --> 19:08.332
- Texted by phone?
- Frost: Yeah.

19:08.367 --> 19:11.402
- Did you track the phone?
- No go. It was sent from a burn phone.

19:13.005 --> 19:15.539
<i>Bet you didn't think you'd
see me again, did you?</i>

19:15.574 --> 19:18.509
- Oh, my god.
- That's a taunt.

19:18.543 --> 19:20.544
<i>Say hello to Kevin.</i>

19:20.579 --> 19:23.481
Tell me that he's breathing, Maura.
Tell me that child is alive.

19:23.515 --> 19:29.020
- I-I can't tell, Jane.
- We got to find that boy.

19:29.087 --> 19:30.221
Frost, let's go through
every piece of video

19:30.255 --> 19:32.423
that he sent us frame by frame.

19:32.457 --> 19:33.524
Play it from the beginning.

19:33.558 --> 19:37.561
Jane? Sorry.
Can I talk to you?

19:37.596 --> 19:39.930
I-I-I can't right now.

19:39.965 --> 19:42.266
- I-It'll have to wait. I'm sorry.
- It can't.

19:42.300 --> 19:46.370
Okay, um, jut give me two seconds.
I'll meet you downstairs.

19:48.073 --> 19:50.941
Okay, uh, start with the section
where he moves the camera.

19:51.009 --> 19:53.411
Jane, we can go through this.

19:54.579 --> 19:57.081
- We'll call if there's anything.
- Korsak: Go.

20:07.359 --> 20:09.026
Hi.

20:09.094 --> 20:11.028
Hey. I'm so sorry. I know you're busy.

20:11.063 --> 20:12.630
No, no. I'm sorry, too. I just... 
I don't have a lot of time.

20:12.664 --> 20:15.566
- My leave's been canceled.
- What?

20:15.600 --> 20:19.236
I've got emergency orders to return.
I'm catching a plane now.

20:19.271 --> 20:24.108
- You have to?
- Yeah.

20:24.142 --> 20:27.978
Okay, uh...

20:28.013 --> 20:30.214
Well, I-I-I wish I could
take you to the airport,

20:30.248 --> 20:31.515
but we have a missing kid.

20:31.583 --> 20:34.218
- Oh, it's okay. I mean it.
- No, it's not.

20:34.252 --> 20:39.323
- What do ... what do we do?
- I don't know. Do you?

20:42.294 --> 20:45.129
- Still on hold with City hall.
- Do they know it's an emergency?

20:45.163 --> 20:47.382
That's why they haven't hung up.
They're going through

20:47.383 --> 20:49.366
about a decade's worth
of business records.

20:49.401 --> 20:50.668
Yeah, yeah. Still here.

20:50.702 --> 20:54.171
Detective Frost, could you continue
playing the video in slow motion?

20:54.206 --> 20:56.307
<i>[computer beeps]
Uh-huh. Great. Thanks.</i>

20:57.642 --> 20:59.577
A guy named Buzz Wallace
owned Every Mask, Inc.

20:59.611 --> 21:03.599
Let's hope Buzz is still alive 
and he kept good records.

21:05.450 --> 21:06.550
Hey, freeze it there.

21:06.585 --> 21:08.018
[computer beeps]

21:08.053 --> 21:11.021
- Is that a window?
- Frost: I can enhance the image.

21:11.089 --> 21:13.991
Do it. That's a window.

21:14.025 --> 21:16.427
<i>Are those houses across the street?</i>

21:16.461 --> 21:18.062
Yes. There's a weather vane.

21:18.096 --> 21:19.497
<i>Let's see which way the
arrow on it's pointing.</i>

21:19.531 --> 21:21.232
I'll check the wind
direction for this morning.

21:21.299 --> 21:23.033
[keyboard clacking]

21:23.068 --> 21:25.402
<i>[computer beeps]
North by Northeast.</i>

21:25.437 --> 21:27.238
So, the arrow is pointing North-ish.

21:27.272 --> 21:28.739
Which means you're looking for a house

21:28.807 --> 21:32.009
on the East side of a street
that runs North to South.

21:32.043 --> 21:33.177
Thank you, magellan.

21:33.211 --> 21:34.311
[computer beeps]

21:34.346 --> 21:37.782
Okay.

21:37.816 --> 21:39.250
[keyboard clacking]

21:39.284 --> 21:40.785
Good news/bad news.

21:40.819 --> 21:44.188
He did manufacture those masks,
but he sold thousands of 'em.

21:44.222 --> 21:46.590
Sergeant, didn't the boy, Zack,

21:46.625 --> 21:48.759
say the clown was headed
to a clown car wash?

21:48.794 --> 21:51.028
Perhaps there was
a car wash in that time

21:51.096 --> 21:54.064
that had some kind of a sales stunt?

21:54.099 --> 21:56.467
I'll see if Buzz sold any clown masks
to a car wash in the 1980s.

21:56.501 --> 21:59.036
Got something ... a
fire-alarm box on the

21:59.037 --> 22:01.572
telephone pole across the
street from the basement.

22:01.606 --> 22:05.242
The first number is worn off.
That would identify the district.

22:05.277 --> 22:08.179
There are 1,200 of
those all over the city.

22:08.213 --> 22:10.347
<i>Oh! 
Oh, good thing Buzz is retired.</i>

22:10.382 --> 22:11.682
Guy is always online.

22:11.750 --> 22:14.318
Yep ... he says he
shipped a dozen clown masks

22:14.352 --> 22:20.191
- to Three-Ring car wash in 1988.
- Searching for a Three-Ring car wash.

22:20.225 --> 22:22.593
Three-Ring car wash. It
was owned by William Miller.

22:22.661 --> 22:25.029
It closed in 2007.

22:25.096 --> 22:27.731
- Got a home address?
- 2141 Lincoln Avenue.

22:27.766 --> 22:30.100
<i>Looks like William Miller
died six months ago.</i>

22:30.135 --> 22:33.704
The house is in probate.
Miller left the house to his son, Brent.

22:33.738 --> 22:35.539
The clown told Zack his name was Brent.

22:38.543 --> 22:42.313
I'll retire from the army.
I'll come back to Boston.

22:42.347 --> 22:43.614
<i>Frost: Jane!</i>

22:43.648 --> 22:47.351
And you'll hate it.
And you'll hate me.

22:47.419 --> 22:50.421
- And... and I have to go.
- Me, too.

22:59.297 --> 23:00.264
Bye.

23:05.704 --> 23:08.505
<i>Frost: We got a possible
address on the house.</i>

23:08.540 --> 23:10.274
We have units on the way.

23:10.308 --> 23:12.276
Okay, well, let's pray
that boy's still alive.

23:44.342 --> 23:45.843
No.

23:47.345 --> 23:49.780
No, no, no, no, no. 
No. Kevin?

23:49.814 --> 23:52.182
[weakly] Mommy?

23:52.217 --> 23:53.450
- No, sweetie. Listen to me, okay?
- Man: We've got the kid. He's alive.

23:53.485 --> 23:54.885
You're safe. I'm a police officer.

23:54.920 --> 23:56.186
We're gonna take you home, okay?

23:56.221 --> 23:57.888
Okay. Get him out of here.

23:57.956 --> 24:00.624
[police radio chatter]

24:00.692 --> 24:02.359
[groans]

24:18.276 --> 24:21.745
Contact wound.
Put the gun right to his own head.

24:21.780 --> 24:23.914
Saved us a whole lot of trouble.

24:23.949 --> 24:26.350
[siren wails]

24:26.384 --> 24:27.885
<i>Looks like he was doing construction.</i>

24:27.953 --> 24:31.889
Probably planned to sell the
family home once it cleared probate.

24:31.957 --> 24:33.891
There's an area of
tattooing and scorched skin

24:33.959 --> 24:37.561
around the perimeter of the wound.

24:37.629 --> 24:39.163
It's got blowback on
the right-hand glove.

24:39.197 --> 24:41.498
It's likely a suicide.

24:42.867 --> 24:44.868
I've got a box of clown costumes here.

24:47.339 --> 24:49.373
Let's get them in for processing.

24:49.407 --> 24:51.642
<i>Korsak: Brent Miller was in Boston in '88.</i>

24:51.710 --> 24:53.410
<i>He and his father are
pretty good suspects</i>

24:53.445 --> 24:56.513
<i>in the disappearance of
that boy, Nick Hamilton.</i>

24:56.548 --> 24:58.916
[sighs] All right, let's
get the cadaver dogs

24:58.950 --> 25:01.418
and the ground-penetrating radar here.

25:01.453 --> 25:02.920
Search the property for his body.

25:02.954 --> 25:05.522
There's no telling how many
crimes this guy committed.

25:10.515 --> 25:13.184
[sighs] 

25:22.394 --> 25:26.363
<i>"It will all be okay."
[sighs]</i>

25:26.398 --> 25:28.966
Yeah, sure it will.
[knock on door]

25:29.034 --> 25:32.237
- Jane? Hi.
- Hey.

25:32.238 --> 25:37.074
- Hey.
- I'm terrible company.

25:37.108 --> 25:39.009
So am I.
I didn't come by to talk.

25:40.245 --> 25:43.681
- Where's your ring?
- Huh? Oh, it's ... safe deposit box.

25:43.715 --> 25:45.182
Maura, this is talking.

25:45.217 --> 25:47.685
I'll stop.
And Angong won't talk, either.

25:47.719 --> 25:50.421
Oh, good. You brought Angong.

25:51.623 --> 25:53.524
Mm-hmm.

25:53.558 --> 25:54.558
Who is Angong?

25:54.626 --> 25:57.061
<i>Tang koon tee nan.</i>

25:57.095 --> 25:59.063
I thought you could use a Thai massage.

26:01.132 --> 26:04.535
Ohh, you are so weird and wonderful.

26:04.569 --> 26:08.405
- Oh! Hi.
- Hi. And if we move your coffee table,

26:08.440 --> 26:10.241
Lawan could give me one, too.

26:10.275 --> 26:12.409
[sighs]

26:13.444 --> 26:16.747
<i>God, no wonder Frost is mad at you.</i>

26:16.781 --> 26:22.219
- [sighs] I'm sorry.
- Well, tell him, not me.

26:22.254 --> 26:24.488
No, I'm apologizing to you, too.

26:26.191 --> 26:30.494
For what, Maura?
This isn't very relaxing, by the way.

26:30.528 --> 26:35.232
I think I was really talking to you
when I told Neda to follow her own path.

26:35.267 --> 26:38.736
So you think Casey should be
the one to give up everything?

26:38.770 --> 26:42.356
Well, I like the idea of that
better than the idea

26:42.357 --> 26:46.443
of you on an army base, serving
mint juleps to Casey's officers.

26:46.478 --> 26:49.079
[chuckles]
Don't worry.

26:49.114 --> 26:52.216
- Really?
- Yeah, I'm sure they all drink beer.

26:54.119 --> 26:56.353
<i>Ow!
Angong, hit her!</i>

26:56.421 --> 26:57.721
<i>[laughs]</i>

27:02.726 --> 27:05.062
It's yours.

27:05.096 --> 27:08.132
- Joan: What do you say?
- Thank you.

27:08.166 --> 27:11.335
You're welcome.
How's your arm feeling?

27:11.403 --> 27:16.140
Okay. Kind of wish you
guys had better band-aids.

27:16.174 --> 27:18.142
[both laugh]
Really? Okay.

27:18.176 --> 27:20.577
I'll look into that.
What, like ... like Spider-man?

27:20.612 --> 27:24.348
- You ever seen the bacon-shaped ones?
- Bacon? Okay.

27:24.382 --> 27:25.349
[both laugh]

27:25.383 --> 27:26.450
That sounds cool. Okay.

27:28.086 --> 27:31.121
Kev, can you tell me
what happened yesterday?

27:31.156 --> 27:34.391
It's okay.
Honey, you're not in trouble.

27:34.426 --> 27:36.827
You should tell Detective
Rizzoli everything, okay?

27:36.861 --> 27:39.797
[sighs]
The clown said he had a puppy.

27:39.864 --> 27:42.433
He said if I guessed
how big his feet were,

27:42.467 --> 27:44.501
he'd give me the puppy.

27:44.536 --> 27:46.303
Is that why you got in the car?

27:48.139 --> 27:50.741
- Yeah.
- Oh, my god.

27:52.143 --> 27:55.346
But you threw your backpack
out the window, though, didn't you?

27:55.413 --> 27:57.247
- Yeah...
- Yeah.

27:57.282 --> 27:59.383
...when I knew something
bad was gonna happen.

27:59.451 --> 28:02.864
That was really, really smart.

28:04.255 --> 28:06.757
<i>- Excuse me.
- Be right back.</i>

28:07.291 --> 28:10.094
I ran a tox screen,
looking for sedatives.

28:10.128 --> 28:14.264
- Kevin tested positive for valium.
- [sighs] Okay, thanks.

28:17.633 --> 28:22.706
Um... did the clown give
you anything to eat or drink?

28:22.741 --> 28:25.809
Yeah. He gave me some
milk and some cookies.

28:25.844 --> 28:27.811
Is that why he doesn't
remember anything?

28:27.846 --> 28:30.347
- Was there something in the milk?
- There was valium.

28:32.450 --> 28:38.922
- Hey. Thank you very much.
- Thanks for finding me.

28:40.325 --> 28:41.525
Is it okay if I get a hug?

28:41.559 --> 28:43.560
- Yeah.
- Okay.

28:43.595 --> 28:46.130
Good. Come here.

28:46.164 --> 28:48.132
[sighs]

28:48.166 --> 28:50.868
You did great.

28:51.902 --> 28:55.205
Okay.
Pack up, then. Thanks.

28:55.240 --> 28:56.707
Damn it.

28:56.741 --> 28:59.143
Ground-penetrating radar
team didn't find remains?

28:59.210 --> 29:02.513
Searched every inch of Brent
Miller's place. Nothing.

29:02.547 --> 29:05.249
I've been digging into his background.

29:05.283 --> 29:08.218
He worked at his father's car wash
while he got his teaching credential,

29:08.253 --> 29:11.822
left Boston in August of '88
to take a teaching job in Philadelphia.

29:11.856 --> 29:15.292
That would have been after
Nick Hamilton's disappearance.

29:15.326 --> 29:17.661
Any missing kids or
clown sightings in Philly?

29:17.695 --> 29:20.431
Nope.
Miller didn't even have parking tickets.

29:20.465 --> 29:22.699
Where did he go for 25 years?

29:22.734 --> 29:25.402
Flea-hopping from school to school,
up and down the East coast.

29:25.437 --> 29:27.404
They chased him out.

29:27.439 --> 29:29.273
I made calls to the
schools where he worked.

29:29.307 --> 29:30.707
Nobody would talk.

29:30.742 --> 29:32.776
Once he was a teacher, he
didn't need a clown costume.

29:32.844 --> 29:34.678
He had access to all the boys he wanted.

29:34.712 --> 29:36.313
[scoffs]

29:36.347 --> 29:38.449
Put him on indefinite
paid leave at his last job.

29:38.516 --> 29:42.286
Molestation's hard to prove.
Most boys don't want to testify.

29:42.353 --> 29:43.687
I'm not sure I would.

29:47.559 --> 29:50.961
What's going on between
you and Dr. Isles?

29:50.995 --> 29:54.998
- Nothing.
- You're a bad liar, Frost.

29:56.734 --> 29:57.968
[sniffs]

29:58.002 --> 30:00.904
The crime lab compared
the footprint we found

30:00.906 --> 30:02.506
at the first kidnapping scene yesterday

30:02.540 --> 30:06.343
to the clown shoe
that Brent was wearing.

30:06.377 --> 30:10.181
- They match.
- Makes sense. Brent tried to grab Zack,

30:10.231 --> 30:11.882
and then killed Reynolds
when he tried to stop him.

30:11.950 --> 30:15.652
- I don't think it was Brent Miller.
- What?

30:15.687 --> 30:17.855
Miller weighed 225 pounds.

30:17.889 --> 30:21.892
And whoever made this impression
weighed less than 175 pounds.

30:21.926 --> 30:25.295
So, two different men wore the shoes?
We got two clowns?

30:25.330 --> 30:26.964
It's the only explanation.

30:27.998 --> 30:33.270
- So, who killed Reynolds?
- Got a toxicology report back,

30:33.338 --> 30:35.939
<i>and Miller had valium in his system.</i>

30:35.974 --> 30:38.677
You found valium in Miller and the boy?

30:38.877 --> 30:40.410
That's odd.

30:40.478 --> 30:42.546
And both had enough to
render them unconscious.

30:42.580 --> 30:44.348
Then how did Brent kill himself?

30:47.585 --> 30:49.686
I don't think he could have.

30:57.505 --> 30:59.940
Did you see anything on his body 

30:59.975 --> 31:04.144
- to indicate he might have been tied up?
- No. No ligature marks.

31:04.179 --> 31:06.289
The only thing I noticed...

31:09.584 --> 31:11.051
Maura: This.

31:11.086 --> 31:13.830
- What's that from?
- Contact dermatitis.

31:14.589 --> 31:18.192
Wait.
Wait, that could be from...

31:18.226 --> 31:20.394
From what?
What are you looking for?

31:20.428 --> 31:24.932
This.
He could have been bound to the chair

31:24.966 --> 31:26.667
that we found him in with ace bandages.

31:26.735 --> 31:29.036
That would explain the
patch of dermatitis.

31:29.104 --> 31:31.338
That's a pretty effective restraint.

31:31.373 --> 31:33.207
It wouldn't have left any traces
if it hadn't touched his skin

31:33.241 --> 31:35.324
where he was perspiring.

31:36.278 --> 31:38.646
<i>Jane: So, this is Miller with Kevin.</i>

31:38.680 --> 31:41.248
But we know it wasn't
Miller who tried to grab Zack

31:41.283 --> 31:43.050
because of the footprint evidence.

31:43.084 --> 31:45.152
Seems like someone wants us
to think the clown is back.

31:45.220 --> 31:46.921
Somebody framed Brent Miller.

31:46.955 --> 31:49.089
It makes sense to frame
him for a current kidnapping

31:49.124 --> 31:51.492
if he got away with
Nick Hamilton's kidnapping in '88.

31:51.526 --> 31:55.663
Wait a minute. What if Miller
molested other boys 25 years ago?

31:55.697 --> 31:58.232
He left Boston, comes back.

31:58.266 --> 32:02.887
What if a grown-up victim saw him
and decided it was payback time?

32:03.371 --> 32:06.607
Frankie, can you grab
the incident reports,

32:06.641 --> 32:09.376
the ones of the kids that claimed
they saw that clown in '88?

32:09.411 --> 32:11.512
There aren't that many.

32:11.546 --> 32:14.315
The three attempted kidnapping victims,

32:14.349 --> 32:17.084
Nick Hamilton, and, uh...

32:17.118 --> 32:22.556
- oh, this one.
- Derrick Johnson, 8.

32:22.590 --> 32:24.591
There's a note here ...
"see additional information."

32:24.626 --> 32:26.727
Well, the Detective's
notes are in the archives.

32:26.761 --> 32:29.096
And there's also a VHS tape

32:29.130 --> 32:30.965
with an interview with
the kid ... I can get 'em.

32:30.999 --> 32:33.267
Carol Lewis is the Detective.
She retired about 10 years ago.

32:33.301 --> 32:34.435
Yeah, grab everything you can find.

32:34.469 --> 32:37.671
- Let's see what that boy has to say.
- Okay.

32:40.174 --> 32:43.243
Derrick says a clown
dressed like an American flag

32:43.278 --> 32:47.114
grabbed him at Turtle pond
and molested him behind the big rocks.

32:47.182 --> 32:49.249
So, why didn't Detective
Lewis go forward with the case?

32:49.284 --> 32:50.551
Must have been something
wrong with the case.

32:50.585 --> 32:52.386
She was a good cop, really competent.

32:52.454 --> 32:56.690
- I got it up.
- Play it.

32:56.725 --> 33:00.160
<i>Now, Derrick, why did you wait two weeks</i>

33:00.195 --> 33:02.162
<i>to tell your mom and dad
that the clown bothered you?</i>

33:02.197 --> 33:04.598
<i>I don't know.</i>

33:04.632 --> 33:06.667
<i>Were you afraid you
might get in trouble?</i>

33:06.735 --> 33:11.538
<i>I was scared.
He didn't want me to tell.</i>

33:11.573 --> 33:14.675
<i>He? Who? The clown?</i>

33:14.709 --> 33:17.411
<i>No. I mean, I didn't want to.</i>

33:17.445 --> 33:19.213
He's lying. Who's "he"?

33:19.247 --> 33:22.750
<i>- What did the clown do?
- H-he saw us fishing.</i>

33:22.817 --> 33:25.052
- "Us." Did you hear that?
<i>- He came out of the woods...</i>

33:25.086 --> 33:26.520
He was with someone.

33:26.554 --> 33:28.622
<i>The clown was in the woods?</i>

33:28.690 --> 33:30.557
- Why is the clown in the woods at Turtle pond?
- Shh! Shh! Shh! Shh!

33:30.592 --> 33:33.527
- What? You're talking.
<i>- Why were you in the woods?</i>

33:33.595 --> 33:37.131
<i>- I mean I wanted to fish at night.</i>
- He said it again! "We."

33:37.165 --> 33:38.766
There was no way that kid
was out there by himself.

33:38.800 --> 33:42.569
<i>And it got dark, and then I saw a face.</i>

33:43.772 --> 33:46.073
<i>And I got scared.</i>

33:46.107 --> 33:51.211
<i>And the face saw me,
and it was the clown.</i>

33:51.246 --> 33:53.213
There's no way I'm
going to sleep tonight.

33:53.248 --> 33:54.715
[scoffs] Me, either.

33:54.749 --> 33:57.718
Derrick Johnson would be 33 now.
Frost, find out where he is.

33:57.752 --> 34:00.521
When did they pave over
the trails at Turtle pond?

34:00.555 --> 34:02.545
Oh, so I can talk now?

34:02.791 --> 34:06.994
1988.
I only remember 'cause I wanted to

34:07.062 --> 34:09.063
ride my bike on the new
paths, and Ma wouldn't let me

34:09.097 --> 34:10.431
because there was a
crazed clown in Boston.

34:10.465 --> 34:13.500
1988.
We're onto something.

34:13.534 --> 34:16.437
<i>What if Brent Miller left
his job at the car wash,</i>

34:16.471 --> 34:18.138
and on his way home

34:18.206 --> 34:22.476
put the clown mask on
to dump Nick Hamilton's body?

34:22.510 --> 34:25.179
Yeah, you can drive a car right up to
where Derrick said they were fishing.

34:25.213 --> 34:27.214
<i>You could bury the body
on one of the dirt paths,</i>

34:27.248 --> 34:28.482
knowing it was gonna be paved over.

34:28.516 --> 34:32.319
Okay, let's do a search at Turtle pond
with a ground-penetrating radar.

34:32.353 --> 34:34.554
<i>Frost: Derrick Johnson lives in town.</i>

34:34.589 --> 34:36.422
Look at his weight ... 169 pounds.

34:36.491 --> 34:38.425
Right in line with the
clown-shoe impressions.

34:38.493 --> 34:42.262
- He had his license revoked for D.U.I.'s.
- Pretty good rap sheet.

34:42.330 --> 34:44.465
Tried to commit suicide in custody.

34:44.532 --> 34:46.800
Being molested as a kid would
sure give him motive now.

34:46.835 --> 34:50.170
- He lives in a men's shelter.
- Let's go pick him up.

34:52.572 --> 34:55.342
Derrick, do you know this man?

35:00.722 --> 35:02.523
No.

35:05.553 --> 35:07.121
What about him?

35:07.188 --> 35:09.823
[shakily] Don't show me that.
I hate clowns.

35:09.858 --> 35:13.351
You hate clowns because of
what this man did to you, don't you?

35:13.386 --> 35:15.496
[breathes deeply]

35:15.530 --> 35:19.800
I was...
8 years old.

35:19.834 --> 35:22.402
And...

35:22.437 --> 35:25.372
I just wanted to have an adventure.

35:25.406 --> 35:28.275
You know, see what it
was like to fish at night

35:28.309 --> 35:30.110
for trout in Turtle pond.

35:30.145 --> 35:32.279
<i>Korsak: What happened?</i>

35:35.950 --> 35:39.786
[voice breaking] He said...

35:39.821 --> 35:42.656
"Hey, slugger. Catch anything?"

35:45.960 --> 35:49.296
[sobs] And then he...

35:49.330 --> 35:51.431
then he caught me.

35:54.469 --> 35:57.337
It must have made you very angry.

35:57.372 --> 36:02.409
[sniffles] I hated him.
I hated what he did.

36:02.443 --> 36:05.179
<i>I hated what happened to me...</i>

36:05.213 --> 36:08.682
because of him.

36:08.716 --> 36:12.116
- I still do.
- Did you hate him enough to kill him?

36:12.151 --> 36:16.131
Yeah.
Wouldn't you?

36:16.166 --> 36:18.692
[knock on door, door opens]

36:18.726 --> 36:22.191
Excuse me. It's important.

36:29.904 --> 36:34.274
I compared Derrick's DNA in codis
to the DNA in the skin cells

36:34.309 --> 36:36.577
found in the scrapings from
under Reynolds' fingernails.

36:36.611 --> 36:38.312
It's not Derrick's DNA.

36:38.346 --> 36:40.847
- But...?
- I did find common markers.

36:40.882 --> 36:42.983
So, our killer is someone
related to Derrick?

36:43.017 --> 36:44.351
Closely related.

36:44.419 --> 36:45.886
[door opens]

36:45.920 --> 36:47.588
They found a body at Turtle pond.

36:47.622 --> 36:49.289
- Is it a boy?
- Yeah.

36:58.105 --> 37:03.009
And after that, you just push
the drawer in like that. 

37:03.043 --> 37:04.410
- It's that easy!
- Mm-hmm.

37:04.445 --> 37:07.180
That's all you have to do, bud.

37:07.214 --> 37:10.049
[bell dings] All right.

37:10.084 --> 37:12.986
Hi. Eli, uh...

37:13.020 --> 37:15.588
call mom and tell her to
come pick you up, okay?

37:15.623 --> 37:17.657
- Yeah. Okay.
- All right, bud.

37:17.725 --> 37:19.259
- Hi!
- Hi.

37:19.293 --> 37:23.463
[chuckles nervously] Oh, it's great news
about that, uh ... the boy, Kevin.

37:23.497 --> 37:26.032
- Yeah.
- Yeah. I'm relieved.

37:26.066 --> 37:30.470
- So, you need my statement?
- No.

37:31.739 --> 37:34.440
This is you

37:34.475 --> 37:36.409
and your little brother Derrick
at Turtle pond, isn't it?

37:36.443 --> 37:39.212
<i>[chuckles] Yeah.</i>

37:39.246 --> 37:43.082
- Yeah. Why?
- You tried to kidnap a boy yesterday.

37:43.167 --> 37:45.068
You ended up killing an innocent man ...

37:45.102 --> 37:47.604
a good samaritan who tried to stop you.

37:47.638 --> 37:49.539
No, I don't ... I don't know
what you're talking about.

37:49.573 --> 37:52.141
I brought you guys the boy's
backpack. Do you remember?

37:52.176 --> 37:54.110
You were driving
Brent's car, weren't you?

37:54.144 --> 37:55.511
And when Kevin threw the
backpack out the window,

37:55.579 --> 37:58.681
you knew you had to come back,
because your fingerprints were on it.

37:58.716 --> 38:00.750
- N-no.
- You first tried to grab Zack,

38:00.784 --> 38:02.452
but that went South
when you killed a man.

38:02.519 --> 38:04.420
<i>But you had no choice, did you?</i>

38:04.455 --> 38:06.256
'Cause you already had Brent
Miller tied up in his basement,

38:06.290 --> 38:08.091
so you had to go through with
your plan, grab another boy.

38:08.125 --> 38:11.594
- I don't know a Brent Miller.
- No?

38:11.662 --> 38:15.198
Okay, well, then you wouldn't mind
giving us a sample of your DNA.

38:15.232 --> 38:18.101
If you'll just chew on your cheek.
We can do a swab and be done.

38:22.473 --> 38:23.673
Show us your hands!
[gun cocks]

38:28.479 --> 38:30.380
I know you want us to think
you got a gun under there.

38:30.414 --> 38:35.351
- Don't let it end like this.
- No. End it.

38:36.453 --> 38:40.790
- Shoot me.
- No.

38:40.824 --> 38:42.425
Show us your hands.

38:45.129 --> 38:47.697
Think about your son, Craig.
Don't do this to him.

38:49.600 --> 38:51.801
Come on.

38:54.138 --> 38:58.841
<i>There you go.
Okay.</i>

39:01.211 --> 39:02.845
You wanted the world to know

39:02.880 --> 39:04.547
what he did to your
little brother, didn't you?

39:04.581 --> 39:10.053
You saw Derrick. How many
lives did that man ruin, huh?

39:10.087 --> 39:15.725
You animal.
You perverted piece of crap.

39:15.759 --> 39:18.695
<i>Jane: Did he molest you, too?</i>

39:18.762 --> 39:21.230
Is that why you put the gun to his head
and pulled the trigger?

39:23.367 --> 39:25.435
<i>We have credit-card receipts.</i>

39:25.502 --> 39:27.837
Brent came into your
store and bought supplies.

39:31.642 --> 39:34.177
You recognized his voice, didn't you?

39:34.211 --> 39:39.615
He called my son...
"slugger."

39:39.650 --> 39:43.453
Why would you do it like this, Craig?
You traumatized two little boys.

39:45.155 --> 39:50.626
I didn't mean to.
It just got out of control.

39:50.661 --> 39:53.529
But I owed Derrick that much.

39:53.564 --> 39:56.666
'Cause I wanted that
pedophile to admit it,

39:56.700 --> 40:01.104
you know,
to expose him for who he was.

40:01.171 --> 40:03.272
You wanted to do more than expose him.

40:03.340 --> 40:07.543
- Yeah, I wanted him dead.
- You're under arrest, Craig.

40:09.279 --> 40:14.250
- Can I say goodbye to my boy?
- Yeah.

40:23.360 --> 40:26.295
[mid-tempo music plays]

40:26.330 --> 40:28.297
[door opens]

40:28.332 --> 40:32.168
[indistinct conversations]

40:32.236 --> 40:35.338
Is Angong booked?

40:35.372 --> 40:41.210
- I can call her.
- No, don't. I want to wallow.

40:41.245 --> 40:46.416
- What an awful case.
- And he's still mad at me.

40:47.718 --> 40:50.553
- Did you apologize?
- Yes. Repeatedly.

40:50.587 --> 40:51.888
He'll get over it.

40:59.829 --> 41:03.800
- I'm still mad.
- I'm still sorry.

41:03.867 --> 41:07.737
- I'm still wallowing.
- This sucks.

41:10.507 --> 41:15.120
- We know of two nice Thai masseuses.
- Excuse me?

41:15.143 --> 41:17.747
Certified massage therapists,
Detective Frost,

41:17.781 --> 41:20.183
from the prestigious Lotus Palm school.

41:20.217 --> 41:23.352
Mm-hmm. And who hasn't heard
of the Lotus Palm school?

41:23.420 --> 41:28.424
- Okay. Well, in that case...
- I get Angong.

41:28.459 --> 41:31.661
<i>Maura: Wait. You can't call dibs.
You had her last time.</i>

41:31.695 --> 41:33.863
<i>Jane: Frost, can you give us a second?
I can too call dibs.</i>

41:33.975 --> 41:36.351
<i>Maura: You cannot have Angong every, single time!</i>

41:36.352 --> 41:39.118
<i>Jane: I can have Angong every, single time!</i>
