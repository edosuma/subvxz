00:02.600 --> 00:05.398
***

00:05.430 --> 00:07.364
- You know it!

00:07.400 --> 00:10.631
White shirt is a classic.
You can never go wrong.

00:10.670 --> 00:12.706
- Then I like these.

00:12.740 --> 00:15.231
- Of course you do.
You gave me these.

00:15.280 --> 00:18.249
- Yeah, because I'm a classic.
- You've got that right, kiddo.

00:18.280 --> 00:21.613
- Well, somebody's bringing
out the handsome. Hot date?

00:21.650 --> 00:24.346
- Actually, Angie needs
a wedding date backup.

00:24.390 --> 00:26.255
What's up?
- Oh, I just wanted

00:26.290 --> 00:28.781
to chat with you about
something, but it can keep.

00:28.820 --> 00:31.459
- Yep.

00:34.430 --> 00:36.762
- Never gets old. Neither
does this one: take it up top!

00:36.800 --> 00:40.361
- Ha, you're funny.

00:40.400 --> 00:44.530
- ** Darling, you send me

00:44.570 --> 00:47.573
* I know you

00:47.610 --> 00:49.601
* Send me

00:49.650 --> 00:54.417
* Darling, you send me

00:54.450 --> 00:57.647
* Honest you do
Honest you do *

00:57.690 --> 00:59.658
- Nice suit.

00:59.690 --> 01:01.851
- This suit's a six.
But that dress?

01:01.890 --> 01:04.222
That's a ten.

01:06.560 --> 01:08.755
Go out there and join them?

01:08.800 --> 01:12.588
- You've heard me sing.
I'm that good of a dancer.

01:12.640 --> 01:15.734
- I guess we should
hit the open bar.

01:19.740 --> 01:23.574
- * At first, I thought
it was infatuation **

01:23.610 --> 01:25.805
- Cousin Kristy married well.

01:25.850 --> 01:27.818
Even the rail booze is premium.

01:27.850 --> 01:30.580
- Good to hear.

01:30.620 --> 01:33.111
Is that your mother?

01:33.160 --> 01:36.425
- Oh, yeah. She's been working
up the nerve to come say hi,

01:36.460 --> 01:38.849
but I like her better scared.
- I know she stood you up

01:38.890 --> 01:41.552
for coffee, but that was three
months ago. Maybe it's time

01:41.600 --> 01:45.263
you cut her a little slack.
- Matthew, so nice to
see you again.

01:45.300 --> 01:47.268
Angie.
- Ms. Everett, you look lovely,

01:47.300 --> 01:49.530
as always. I hope you don't
mind, but I noticed your zipper

01:49.570 --> 01:52.130
is a little undone.
- Oh, heavens.

01:52.180 --> 01:55.479
You are a doll to tell me that.

01:55.510 --> 01:58.377
Not everyone would do that.
- Come on, beautiful ladies.
A little smile.

02:00.780 --> 02:02.589
I'll make sure
to get you a copy.

02:05.390 --> 02:09.156
- The ceremony was lovely.
- Yep.

02:09.190 --> 02:11.920
- Angie, I know you're angry
and you have every right to be,

02:11.960 --> 02:14.258
but I have been looking forward

02:14.300 --> 02:16.427
to this day for
a very long time.

02:16.470 --> 02:19.234
- Kristy's glad you're here.
Can we get that drink now?

02:19.270 --> 02:21.488
- I have something
for you. A present!

02:21.540 --> 02:25.909
- OK, fair comment.

02:25.940 --> 02:28.170
But no, it's something else.

02:28.210 --> 02:30.371
Comp night at the casino?

02:30.410 --> 02:32.469
Wait, maybe a bag
full of nickels?

02:32.520 --> 02:34.943
- I knew you'd be angry,

02:34.980 --> 02:37.210
but I didn't think
you'd be so cruel.

02:41.290 --> 02:44.179
- Not a word.

02:44.230 --> 02:47.620
Sorry, I shouldn't have
dragged you into this.

02:47.660 --> 02:49.491
- I think this could be an
opportunity for you and Nora.

02:49.530 --> 02:51.498
You just have to
decide to take it.

02:51.530 --> 02:55.591
- Angie! Did you see our first
dance as a married couple?

02:55.640 --> 02:58.336
Oh, my God, we were amazing.
I didn't trip once.

02:58.370 --> 03:00.406
- Matt Shade, my cousin Kristy
Greene, the world's most

03:00.440 --> 03:02.340
beautiful bride.

03:02.380 --> 03:04.940
- And my husband, Robert Garvey,

03:04.980 --> 03:07.414
the Garviest
of the Garveys. Yum.

03:07.450 --> 03:10.681
- Pleasure to meet you, Shadow.
- Thank you. You too.

03:10.720 --> 03:13.951
- Didn't you have a different
date earlier... Derek Nolan?

03:13.990 --> 03:16.686
- He had a work thing come up.
- Nolan seemed a little...

03:16.730 --> 03:19.358
Judgey?
The opposite of fun?

03:19.400 --> 03:22.494
- Oh, I get it. This one
is the closer. I like him.

03:22.530 --> 03:24.498
Angie, you have to come
upstairs with me.

03:24.530 --> 03:26.964
I can't go to the bathroom
by myself. Key, please!

03:28.870 --> 03:31.532
- We'll be back.

03:34.440 --> 03:36.305
- Yes, please.
- Yeah.

03:38.380 --> 03:40.473
- Wow, look at this place.

03:40.520 --> 03:42.943
All I can say is... after party!

03:42.990 --> 03:45.015
- I'm already on it
and you're not invited.

03:45.050 --> 03:47.018
- Ha ha ha.

03:47.060 --> 03:51.451
Whoa! You got pictures already?

03:51.490 --> 03:53.594
Bryan brought a photo
printer with him

03:53.630 --> 03:55.689
and gave us our first photo
as an old married couple

03:55.730 --> 03:58.722
before we sat down to eat!
- What a thoughtful
photographer.

03:58.770 --> 04:00.965
Good work, Bryan.
- Oh! And Sherry got me

04:01.000 --> 04:03.434
a touch-up kit, which I'm
sure I need almost as much

04:03.470 --> 04:06.007
as I need to hit the can.

04:06.040 --> 04:07.928
- No, I'm good.

04:07.980 --> 04:10.301
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

04:12.320 --> 04:14.470
Oh, my God. Oh, no!

04:14.520 --> 04:17.944
- The tiara.

04:17.990 --> 04:19.878
Angie, what am I going to do?

04:19.920 --> 04:23.424
It's been stolen.

04:23.460 --> 04:27.055
- ** I see you and you see me

04:27.100 --> 04:31.389
* Watch you blowin' the lines
when you're making a scene *

04:31.430 --> 04:34.729
* Oh boy, you've got to know

04:34.770 --> 04:36.829
* What my head overlooks

04:36.870 --> 04:40.579
* The senses will show
to my heart *

04:40.610 --> 04:43.408
* When it's watching for lies

04:43.450 --> 04:45.668
* 'Cause you can't escape my

04:45.710 --> 04:47.416
* Private Eyes

04:47.450 --> 04:49.782
* They're watching you

04:49.820 --> 04:52.482
* Private Eyes

04:52.520 --> 04:54.511
* They're watching you,
watching you, watching you *

04:54.560 --> 04:58.451
* Watching you *

04:58.490 --> 05:02.529
- I took the veil off here and
I put the tiara in the safe.

05:02.570 --> 05:04.663
I know I locked it.

05:04.700 --> 05:07.737
Oh, Angie. It's worth
$50 000, at least.

05:07.770 --> 05:11.661
- It's OK. We'll call the hotel,
we'll call the cops--

05:11.710 --> 05:13.678
- No! You don't understand.

05:13.710 --> 05:16.508
This is my fault, somehow.
I know it will be. Angie,

05:16.550 --> 05:19.007
people like us don't marry
people like the Garveys,

05:19.050 --> 05:21.939
and now I've lost
theIr family heIrloom?

05:23.920 --> 05:25.808
You have to help me recover it.

05:25.850 --> 05:27.750
- Come on, Kristy.
- You're guests.

05:27.790 --> 05:30.827
No one will even know
they're beIng questioned.

05:30.860 --> 05:32.828
You could run downstairs
and find the thief

05:32.860 --> 05:35.556
before it's too late.
Unless it's hotel staff or--

05:35.600 --> 05:38.660
Oh, my God,
what if it's a guest?

05:38.700 --> 05:41.669
- Who else knew
the code to the safe?

05:41.700 --> 05:44.430
- Just me.
- Alright.

05:44.470 --> 05:47.439
What about room keys?
- Robert kept the key

05:47.480 --> 05:50.108
in his tux jacket and Ezra,
our wedding planner,

05:50.150 --> 05:52.573
he has the other one.
- Hotel staff had access.

05:52.620 --> 05:54.576
- Alright, listen.
This is your wedding day, OK?

05:54.620 --> 05:57.589
So we'll take care of this.
You need to go downstairs
and enjoy being a bride.

05:59.890 --> 06:01.778
- That's my diary
of the whole wedding.

06:01.820 --> 06:04.482
It was Ezra's idea.
- I think Ezra should fill in

06:04.530 --> 06:07.693
the blanks. Wish me luck.
- I'll check the hotel staff

06:07.730 --> 06:09.869
situation. Be discreet! And you,

06:09.900 --> 06:12.733
you need to get back to your
wedding. It's gonna be OK.

06:12.770 --> 06:14.590
- OK.

06:14.640 --> 06:17.461
- I'm the bride's cousin's date.

06:17.510 --> 06:19.728
And trust me, Ezra, this
is close to the last thing

06:19.780 --> 06:22.078
I want to be doing.
- I've got a cake-cutting

06:22.110 --> 06:24.442
in 20 minutes, and
I'm supposed to slow down

06:24.480 --> 06:26.448
to help you fill out this diary?

06:26.480 --> 06:28.448
- Kristy wants a record
of everyone who helped,

06:28.480 --> 06:30.414
and I'm telling you,
no cake is getting cut

06:30.450 --> 06:32.987
until I get this done.
- Well, bride's cousin's date,

06:33.020 --> 06:35.750
you're definitely emasculated.
Don't worry, you wear it well.

06:35.790 --> 06:37.781
What do you want to know?
- Kristy wants to know

06:37.830 --> 06:39.559
how many people have been
in and out of the suite.

06:39.600 --> 06:41.556
What was delivered and when,
and who was there.

06:41.600 --> 06:44.125
- Between 1:20 and now,
I've been up there non-stop.

06:44.170 --> 06:47.094
Florist, champagne, ice,

06:47.140 --> 06:49.665
pastry and chocolate delivery.

06:49.710 --> 06:51.860
Sunflower petals on the bed

06:51.910 --> 06:54.037
and then I lit the
candles around the tub.

06:54.080 --> 06:56.036
And then my photographer Bryan
showed up and he already had

06:56.080 --> 06:59.743
a beautiful picture in
a frame, so we set it up,

06:59.780 --> 07:02.169
after some debate. And
then I was busy arranging

07:02.220 --> 07:04.484
16 other things before the
first dance, do you want to know

07:04.520 --> 07:06.488
about those too?
- So you were In there...

07:06.520 --> 07:08.511
six times. No, seven.

07:08.560 --> 07:11.859
- All _that and math too.
Your gIrl must be so proud.

07:11.890 --> 07:15.121
- And who were
you in there with?

07:15.160 --> 07:18.618
- You don't need to know the
names of the courier pigeons

07:18.670 --> 07:20.729
for the bridal diary.
What's going on?

07:20.770 --> 07:22.738
It's OK.
I'm sure I have enough.

07:22.770 --> 07:25.534
You didn't loan your key
card to anyone, did you?

07:25.570 --> 07:28.004
- Ezra, buddy--

07:28.040 --> 07:30.076
- I'm going up there!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

07:30.110 --> 07:32.510
Two bottles of champagne
walked out of the room.

07:32.550 --> 07:34.518
- No!
- You can't say anything.

07:34.550 --> 07:36.211
- Poor Kristy. Poor Robert.
Are they all right?

07:36.250 --> 07:38.810
- Yeah.
- Curse this hotel!

07:38.850 --> 07:42.081
I have a cake cutting
in 15 minutes.

07:42.120 --> 07:45.556
: Right.

07:51.000 --> 07:53.833
That's dangerous, you know.
Walking while texting.

07:53.870 --> 07:56.191
You should really slow down,
be more careful.

07:56.240 --> 07:58.708
- And who should
I be careful for?

07:58.740 --> 08:01.709
- I know Angie was rough--
- No, don't worry about it.

08:01.740 --> 08:04.800
She's right. I'm a failure,
I'm a disappointment.

08:04.850 --> 08:08.013
I need to learn to embrace it.
- She's hurt.

08:08.050 --> 08:11.087
But I still think you two
can patch things up.

08:13.090 --> 08:15.854
- Of course you do, honey. But
I haven't disappointed you yet.

08:15.890 --> 08:17.949
Would you like me to start?
- Why don't you stop by

08:17.990 --> 08:20.993
the office in a few days? Bring
that present you mentioned.

08:21.030 --> 08:24.659
- Too late now.
Lovely to see you, Matthew.

08:24.700 --> 08:26.668
I gotta go.

08:26.700 --> 08:28.759
- The hottest.

08:28.800 --> 08:30.836
- So housekeeping was only
on the second floor today?

08:30.870 --> 08:32.838
- They sweep the property
one floor at a time.

08:32.880 --> 08:34.836
We try to stay clear
of the bridal suite.

08:34.880 --> 08:37.599
There's enough traffic already.

08:37.650 --> 08:39.914
- Nothing past the first floor.

08:39.950 --> 08:42.589
I have the number
of key entries.

08:42.620 --> 08:44.838
- Great. Thank you.

08:48.360 --> 08:50.749
The room was accessed 10 times
between when the tiara went

08:50.790 --> 08:53.224
into the safe and when
we found It was mIssmg.

08:53.260 --> 08:55.592
- So Ezra was seven.

08:55.630 --> 08:57.598
which leaves one entry
unaccounted for.

08:57.630 --> 08:59.962
- But it's not just
who and how many.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.639
The safe wasn't broken into.
Someone must have seen her

09:02.670 --> 09:05.104
punch in the code.
- The way the safe is situated,

09:05.140 --> 09:08.906
that would be impossible.
- [You know, this reminds me
of this time I was in Helsinki.]

09:08.940 --> 09:12.068
Man, those Finns love to drink.
I mean, they really love it--

09:14.680 --> 09:17.046
- So this one night, I get
hammered. Well, we all did.

09:17.090 --> 09:19.718
And when I get back to my room,
my underwear are locked

09:19.760 --> 09:21.978
in my safe. Now that I think
about it, I'm not sure why.

09:22.020 --> 09:24.181
I couldn't remember my code.
- Shade!

09:24.230 --> 09:26.721
- So I call engineering.
This guy comes up, nice guy,

09:26.760 --> 09:28.591
Sacramento fan--
- He did a reset.

09:28.630 --> 09:31.269
- And he had access
to every room.

09:31.300 --> 09:34.633
Let me see ifI can find
that guy at this hotel.

09:38.970 --> 09:41.609
Hey! Are you the
maintenance engineer?

09:41.640 --> 09:43.608
I'm having a problem
with the safe in my room.

09:43.650 --> 09:45.675
- Yeah, sorry. My shift
ended five minutes ago.

09:45.710 --> 09:47.439
- Come on, man. It'll just
take a couple of minutes.

09:47.480 --> 09:50.688
I'm sure you got everything you
need in that bag right there.

09:50.720 --> 09:53.712
- This is heavy. What do
you got in here?
- Nothing!

09:59.190 --> 10:01.954
- I can't help it.

10:02.000 --> 10:06.960
Tonight's caterer is amazing.
Please don't tell anyone?

10:07.000 --> 10:09.230
- I found the hotel super.

10:09.270 --> 10:12.671
He's not our guy. He had bigger
poultry to fry. Don't ask.

10:12.710 --> 10:14.871
- So we're back
to the wedding guests.

10:14.910 --> 10:17.845
There's only 100 of them.
- Oh, come on, Everett.

10:17.880 --> 10:20.644
No guests were in the suite. No
hotel workers were in the suite.

10:20.680 --> 10:24.719
It was Kristy, Robert, Ezra
and a bunch of wedding vendors.

10:24.750 --> 10:27.810
- The vendors know every
in and out of the wedding.

10:27.860 --> 10:30.829
- And a lot of them were
in and out of Kristy's suite.
- We need to look at everyone

10:30.860 --> 10:32.725
that worked this wedding,
who entered the room...

10:32.760 --> 10:34.751
- Do background checks,
figure out if any of them

10:34.800 --> 10:37.325
came back without Ezra.
- Thing is, I'm not sure

10:37.370 --> 10:40.237
we can question him or anyone
else without sounding the alarm.

10:40.270 --> 10:43.103
- Maybe there is a way.

10:45.840 --> 10:48.274
Everett.

10:48.310 --> 10:51.404
Will you make me
the happiest man alive,

10:51.450 --> 10:54.214
so we can interview people who
can help us plan our big day?

10:54.250 --> 10:56.411
- I thought you'd never ask.

10:59.920 --> 11:02.354
Oh, thank you.

11:02.390 --> 11:04.927
Thank you.
- Thank you.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.389
- We've ruled out the hotel
staff. Aside from Robert

11:10.430 --> 11:12.830
and your mom, none of the guests
were in here. So that means that

11:12.870 --> 11:16.328
the wedding vendors
are our best suspects.
- I can't bear it, Angie.

11:16.370 --> 11:18.338
I don't want it
to be any of them.

11:18.370 --> 11:21.100
They were all part of my day,
which was really special.

11:21.140 --> 11:25.270
Most of the time. _
- Hey, Angle. NIce surprise.

11:25.310 --> 11:27.870
- Robert!
- I thought you were at the gym.

11:27.920 --> 11:29.945
- Mom just texted me. They
decided to leave a day early,

11:29.990 --> 11:31.844
so she asked me
to get the tiara.

11:31.890 --> 11:33.983
- She wants it now.

11:34.020 --> 11:36.318
That makes more sense, given
we're leaving on our honeymoon

11:36.360 --> 11:38.851
on Sunday. What did
you use as the combo?

11:38.890 --> 11:40.858
- It's gone.

11:40.900 --> 11:43.767
Someone stole it.
- OK...

11:43.800 --> 11:45.768
Usually your jokes
are funnier, babe.

11:45.800 --> 11:47.461
- Kristy asked me
to look into it.

11:47.500 --> 11:51.163
- Somebody stole it on our
wedding day, and you
didn't tell me?

11:51.210 --> 11:55.101
- Bobby, I just... I know how
much it means to your family.

11:55.140 --> 11:57.199
- We're not supposed to keep
secrets from each other.

11:57.250 --> 11:59.343
We just promised that
in front of everyone.

11:59.380 --> 12:03.009
- Bobby, please.
I just wanted to make it right.

12:03.050 --> 12:05.041
I know we can.

12:07.460 --> 12:09.826
: Alright,
hand it over.

12:09.860 --> 12:11.828
: Here you go.

12:14.200 --> 12:17.089
- This is work, and I always
have fun when I'm working.

12:17.130 --> 12:19.963
- Impressive. Didn't know you
had such a thing for purple.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.968
- I don't have
a thing for purple.

12:22.000 --> 12:23.968
Getting-married-Angie
has a thing for purple.

12:24.010 --> 12:27.400
- That's some serious bling.
- "Great-aunt Lulu's"
sapphire necklace.

12:27.440 --> 12:30.307
The perfect bait for our thief
that she's going to loan us
for the wedding.

12:32.880 --> 12:36.270
- It's for a case. Dad and Angie
are pretending they're engaged.

12:36.320 --> 12:39.483
- We're totally pretending.
- Couldn't be more fake.
- I'm the best man!

12:39.520 --> 12:42.182
- Bridesmaid!

12:42.220 --> 12:44.780
If you're engaged,
you have a ring.

12:44.830 --> 12:49.028
- Oh, crap.
- Amateurs. Wait there.

12:49.060 --> 12:51.267
- So are you gone
for the whole day?

12:51.300 --> 12:53.268
- Just a couple hours, honey.

12:53.300 --> 12:55.791
Bit of a ticking clock
on this one. Listen.

12:55.840 --> 12:57.831
I know I've been pretty busy
lately, so what do you say

12:57.870 --> 13:00.873
after this case we take a road
trip

13:00.910 --> 13:03.276
Go to the waterpark,
the butterfly conservatory...

13:03.310 --> 13:05.346
- Yeah, that sounds fun.
- You're not too cool

13:05.380 --> 13:07.439
to go to the waterpark
with your old man?

13:07.480 --> 13:10.119
- Dad, I will never
be that cool. Swear.

13:10.150 --> 13:12.516
- Here you go.

13:12.550 --> 13:14.882
- Wow.

13:14.920 --> 13:18.924
- Six karats.
That's a lot of ice time.

13:18.960 --> 13:23.067
- Thank you, Becca.
- It's the least I can do.

13:23.100 --> 13:25.489
Matt's been steadier
than I've ever seen him,

13:25.530 --> 13:28.090
more grounded.

13:28.140 --> 13:31.507
I think that working for you
has had a lot to do with that,

13:34.610 --> 13:38.307
I'm nice.
I'm helpful. Remember that.

13:38.350 --> 13:41.547
- Yeah...

13:41.580 --> 13:44.913
Yeah, for real, we've got to go.
We've got wedding vendors

13:44.950 --> 13:47.282
stacked deeper than
planes over O'Hare.

13:47.320 --> 13:49.379
- I hope this works.

13:49.420 --> 13:51.422
When Robert found out
that the tiara was missing,

13:51.460 --> 13:53.451
Kristy said he wouldn't speak
to her for three hours.

13:53.500 --> 13:55.957
- It's gonna work.
We've got a plan. Let's review.

13:56.000 --> 13:58.867
- OK. Learn the routine.
- Confirm access.

13:58.900 --> 14:01.960
- Tell them _the date.
- Tempt them With the jewels.

14:02.000 --> 14:05.299
- So nice to meet you guys.

14:05.340 --> 14:08.104
- Gary, we really want
to get this right,

14:08.140 --> 14:10.608
so if it's alright with you,
we've got a lot of questions.

14:10.650 --> 14:13.471
- You bet, but before we start,
I like to get a feel

14:13.520 --> 14:16.011
for who you guys are.
First dance?

14:16.050 --> 14:18.314
- Summer Wind.
- Ring of Fire.

14:18.350 --> 14:21.057
- We can try a mash-up.
- I'd like to understand

14:21.090 --> 14:24.059
how much time we'll be spending
together on the big day, Sherry.

14:24.090 --> 14:26.991
- Oh, typically, three hours.
I know it seems excessive.

14:27.030 --> 14:29.453
I basically put on
foundation and mascara

14:29.500 --> 14:32.094
and you really don't need the
help. Unless you want to look

14:32.130 --> 14:34.030
like a Klingon.
I can do that too.

14:34.070 --> 14:36.095
- I blow you out two hours
before the ceremony

14:36.140 --> 14:39.109
and if you want a new look
for the reception, I can
stick around.

14:39.140 --> 14:41.335
You, I wouldn't change a thing.

14:41.380 --> 14:44.247
- Well, bride's cousin's date.

14:44.280 --> 14:46.248
You didn't_ mention
your upcoming nuptials

14:46.280 --> 14:49.511
when you were grilling me
about Kristy's diary yesterday.

14:49.550 --> 14:51.484
- She said she couldn't
have done it without you.

14:51.520 --> 14:54.250
- Obviously. Trust me,
by the end of this

14:54.290 --> 14:56.554
you're going to feel
like you're marrying me,

14:56.590 --> 14:59.627
because I am in your pocket.
Especially yours.

14:59.660 --> 15:02.959
- So when my beautiful
fiance is getting ready

15:03.000 --> 15:05.366
in the bridal suite, you'll
be in there with her, Gary?

15:05.400 --> 15:07.288
- Yeah, I like to go over
the set list one more time.

15:07.340 --> 15:11.458
- A lot of brides do enjoy
a special prayer alone with me.

15:11.510 --> 15:15.606
- I usually sleep
in the bridal suite.

15:15.640 --> 15:18.279
I mean, vendors are
arriving at all hours.

15:18.310 --> 15:21.541
- And what if I want
you to stick around?
- Oh, well, that's extra.

15:21.580 --> 15:23.684
But I do leave
these cute little kits

15:23.720 --> 15:25.688
so you can do
your own touch-ups,

15:25.720 --> 15:27.984
though I probably shouldn't
because then you'll realize

15:28.020 --> 15:30.284
you don't really need me anyway.

15:30.330 --> 15:33.219
- Let's get your vibe.

15:33.260 --> 15:34.989
- You want good pictures--

15:35.030 --> 15:38.295
You want the best pictures,
then our relationship starts
right away. I want to see you.

15:38.330 --> 15:41.367
I want to see
the real you, so...

15:41.400 --> 15:43.436
show me.

15:51.380 --> 15:54.076
What is it?
- The real you needs work.

15:54.120 --> 15:57.044
- What's your availability
one month from now?

15:57.090 --> 15:59.285
- Impossible.

15:59.320 --> 16:01.413
- You guys know my band's
pretty popular, right?

16:01.460 --> 16:04.054
- Darlings, good luck.

16:04.090 --> 16:06.251
- Try six months from now.
- I mean...

16:06.290 --> 16:09.293
Look at her vision
board. We are ready.

16:09.330 --> 16:11.764
- Sapphires. So pretty.

16:11.800 --> 16:15.736
- I'm sure I can make it work.
- I love celebrity weddings.

16:15.770 --> 16:18.034
- And you must have people
that you like to work with?

16:18.070 --> 16:21.301
- I mean, if you want A-list,
Bryan Pratt is an artist.

16:21.340 --> 16:24.309
- Sherry Gibbs
is insanely talented.

16:24.350 --> 16:27.740
- Oh, Gary Barrett.
He's an incredible musician.

16:27.780 --> 16:30.317
I only ever hear the
rehearsals, but so fun!

16:32.750 --> 16:34.718
- Come on, guys.
You're wasting my time.

16:34.760 --> 16:37.251
I need you to show me
how you feel as a couple.

16:37.290 --> 16:39.588
Look at each other.

16:42.300 --> 16:44.291
Show me what you feel.

16:44.330 --> 16:46.321
Because if I can't feel it,
then the camera won't see it.

16:46.370 --> 16:49.259
***

17:01.350 --> 17:03.739
Now I see it.

17:03.790 --> 17:05.746
- Sherry really reacted
to the sapphires,

17:05.790 --> 17:08.588
but she left the wedding hours
before Kristy put the tiara

17:08.620 --> 17:11.054
into the_ safe and I never saw
her again, so I'd con5ider her

17:11.090 --> 17:13.797
a no. Mycroft didn't jump at the
bait, or Maddie the Minister.

17:13.830 --> 17:15.798
Gary and Bryan were both
yeses after they saw

17:15.830 --> 17:17.798
Aunt Lulu's necklace,
and God knows

17:17.830 --> 17:20.196
Bryan was in the bridal
suite at Kristy's wedding.

17:20.240 --> 17:22.538
If I had to choose one person--
- You kissed me.

17:22.570 --> 17:25.664
- Yes. And you kissed me back,

17:25.710 --> 17:29.077
and that was good, because Bryan
was suspicious and now he isn't.

17:29.110 --> 17:32.375
He's one of our best suspects.
- So that was all about
fooling Bryan?

17:32.410 --> 17:34.810
- Yeah. I mean, he wasn't
convinced, now he is.

17:34.850 --> 17:38.684
We did it for Kristy.
- Yes, we did it for Kristy.

17:43.730 --> 17:45.755
- Of course.

17:45.790 --> 17:47.849
- Ezra had the most access.

17:47.900 --> 17:50.391
- And he became available
once he saw the sapphires.

17:50.430 --> 17:54.139
Ezra, Bryan, Gary. We've made
some really good progress.

17:54.170 --> 17:55.728
- You know, when Becca and
I got married, she did all this.

17:55.770 --> 17:59.206
This was actually enjoyable.
I thought it was
incredibly stressful.

17:59.240 --> 18:01.299
Oh!

18:01.340 --> 18:03.308
Hey, I was just
going to call you.

18:03.350 --> 18:05.739
Why do you sound so serious?
- Nolan.

18:05.780 --> 18:09.443
- Oh, OK. On my way.

18:09.480 --> 18:11.789
Nolan said the groom's
parents called in the theft

18:11.820 --> 18:13.879
to the police. He wants me
to go down to the station.

18:13.920 --> 18:16.150
- No idea.

18:16.190 --> 18:18.078
But I'm going to find out.

18:24.870 --> 18:28.237
- Oh, hey, hey, hey!

18:28.270 --> 18:30.602
Let me help you with that.
- No, no, I'm OK.

18:30.640 --> 18:32.608
I'm a strong
and independent woman.

18:32.640 --> 18:34.631
- I know you are.

18:34.680 --> 18:37.649
So tonight's the night, huh?

18:37.680 --> 18:39.671
- Yeah!

18:39.710 --> 18:43.316
The condo is ready and so am I.

18:46.650 --> 18:48.754
You've been a doll, Matt.

18:48.790 --> 18:52.157
I hope you understand how much
this has really meant to me.

18:52.190 --> 18:55.489
- It was a pleasure having you.
- OK, so...

18:55.530 --> 18:57.896
I just need a couple
of days to get organized

18:57.930 --> 19:00.728
and then I'll pop by
and pick her up on Monday?

19:00.770 --> 19:04.729
Are you OK to pack up her stuff?

19:04.770 --> 19:07.432
I thought that would be a nice
moment for you, to figure out

19:07.480 --> 19:09.869
what Jules wants to keep here
for every other weekend.

19:09.910 --> 19:12.174
- Um, what do you mean
every other weekend?

19:12.210 --> 19:15.213
- We agreed that the custody
arrangement would resume

19:15.250 --> 19:17.218
when I got back.
- Yeah, but everything

19:17.250 --> 19:19.445
has changed.
I'm not on the road.

19:19.490 --> 19:21.458
Jules and I have a real
relationship now.

19:21.490 --> 19:23.958
I can't go back
to being a weekend dad.

19:23.990 --> 19:27.756
- We agreed.
- Uh, Becks.

19:27.800 --> 19:29.791
Jules is 14.

19:29.830 --> 19:33.231
This feels like the kind of
thing we should ask her about.

19:33.270 --> 19:36.330
- Yeah, you would say that.

19:36.370 --> 19:38.861
- No.

19:38.910 --> 19:41.276
- Jules loves you.
That's not going to change

19:41.310 --> 19:43.642
if she spends
half her time here.

19:43.680 --> 19:46.376
Plus, it may be good for you.

19:46.410 --> 19:48.378
A little time on your own
to do your own thing.

19:48.420 --> 19:51.947
- My daughter is my thing.

19:55.260 --> 19:58.525
A 14-year-old girl
needs her mother, Matt.

20:01.000 --> 20:03.798
You just don't understand that.

20:10.610 --> 20:12.999
- Matt.

20:13.040 --> 20:14.871
Are you OK?

20:16.910 --> 20:19.504
- Oh, and can you be
the one to tell Jules?

20:19.550 --> 20:21.643
Otherwise I'm the bad guy.

20:29.690 --> 20:31.681
***

20:36.930 --> 20:39.763
If you guys are looking for
suspects, Shade and I have
it narrowed down to a few.

20:39.800 --> 20:43.338
- Ang. This isn't my case

20:43.370 --> 20:46.567
and Maz wishes it wasn't his.

21:01.520 --> 21:03.750
- We've got 10 minutes.
Start talking.

21:03.790 --> 21:06.623
- That Kurtis has turned into
qUIte the looker, hasn't he?

21:06.660 --> 21:09.925
Clark Gable with
a dash of Seth Rogen.

21:11.930 --> 21:14.490
Or vice versa.

21:14.540 --> 21:16.929
- Did you even
think about Kristy

21:16.970 --> 21:19.632
when you stole that tiara?
- I didn't take anything.

21:19.670 --> 21:22.036
- You were seen exiting
the bridal suite.

21:22.080 --> 21:24.503
- Darling, you know how
I feel about public washrooms.

21:24.550 --> 21:27.576
- No. No, I actually don't.

21:27.620 --> 21:29.770
How'd you get in?

21:29.820 --> 21:33.779
- Robert loaned me the key.
Without knowing.

21:33.820 --> 21:36.459
- You stole his key card
to use the john,

21:36.490 --> 21:38.651
is that the story?

21:38.690 --> 21:40.658
Give me a break, Mom.

21:40.700 --> 21:43.021
Robert's father is
a bigwig financial guy.

21:43.060 --> 21:45.927
He knows the Crown Attorney
personally. They're going
to charge you with theft.

21:45.970 --> 21:48.461
- You really believe
that I would steal

21:48.500 --> 21:50.639
the tiara from my own niece?

21:50.670 --> 21:53.776
- The police found 10 grand
on you that you won't explain.

21:53.810 --> 21:56.074
So yes. I do believe it.

21:56.110 --> 21:58.408
And you know why.

21:58.450 --> 22:01.715
Just tell them where
they can find the tiara.

22:01.750 --> 22:04.389
Maybe they'll go easy
on you if you cooperate.

22:09.590 --> 22:11.683
- Hey. First of all,
thanks for the text.

22:11.730 --> 22:14.528
Second, seriously?
You arrested Angie's mom?

22:14.560 --> 22:17.028
- They're talking. Regrettably,
it's not really looking good.

22:17.060 --> 22:20.097
- The hotel's CCTV set-up

22:20.130 --> 22:23.566
was archaic, but the camera in
the elevator worked just fine.

22:23.610 --> 22:25.828
That's her getting off
on the third floor.

22:25.870 --> 22:26.939
20 minutes later,
a guest saw her

22:26.970 --> 22:29.029
coming out of the bridal suite.
And there's the matter

22:29.080 --> 22:31.446
of the 10 grand in her purse.
- That doesn't prove anything.

22:31.480 --> 22:34.449
- It kinda does,
if you know her.

22:38.790 --> 22:42.157
- I remember one time going
over to Angie's after school

22:42.190 --> 22:44.727
and the stereo was gone.

22:44.760 --> 22:47.729
It wasn't even the first
time Nora sold something

22:47.760 --> 22:49.557
to stake a bet. But it was
the first time I really saw

22:49.600 --> 22:52.524
what it did to Angie.

22:52.570 --> 22:54.993
- You are the only suspect.

22:55.040 --> 22:56.996
There's a witness.

22:57.040 --> 22:59.167
Then there's this money
that you won't explain.

22:59.210 --> 23:02.805
- It's always about
the evidence with you.
Never what's in your heart.

23:02.840 --> 23:04.979
- You don't want to know
what's in my heart.

23:05.010 --> 23:07.843
- Oh, Angie. Fine, I did it.

23:07.880 --> 23:09.848
Let them throw the book at me.

23:09.880 --> 23:12.713
At least then I'll be out
of your life. Will that
make you happy?

23:17.630 --> 23:21.555
I'm sick of this. All of it.

23:23.530 --> 23:25.498
and it's already
a waste of time.

23:35.210 --> 23:38.008
I'm done.
- Hey, Ang--

23:38.050 --> 23:41.508
- Lock her up, don't --
I don't care. She's all yours.

23:44.020 --> 23:46.989
- That went well.

23:47.020 --> 23:50.751
- No, I'm not. That's why
she might talk to me.

24:01.100 --> 24:04.069
- I don't want to talk
about her. I just can't.

24:04.110 --> 24:06.237
- Fair enough.

24:06.270 --> 24:08.636
So how about you tell me
what I can do for you?

24:08.680 --> 24:12.207
- I hope you have an idea,
because I am tapped out.

24:12.250 --> 24:15.549
- I was thinking
a few days away.

24:15.580 --> 24:19.789
You know,
maybe a beach, blue skies.

24:19.820 --> 24:22.687
I hear St. Lucia's beautiful
this time of year.

24:22.720 --> 24:24.722
- I can't.

24:24.760 --> 24:26.785
I've got the agency.
There's so much work.

24:26.830 --> 24:28.798
- You see, that's why
you took on a partner.

24:28.830 --> 24:31.025
- Associate. _
- Whatever, assoaate.

24:31.070 --> 24:33.789
There's got to be some
advantage to that guy.

24:43.750 --> 24:45.741
- When I saw you at the wedding,

24:45.780 --> 24:48.874
your hair was a little wild,
you were a little unzipped.

24:48.920 --> 24:52.242
I know that look.
You were with a guy.

24:52.290 --> 24:54.554
- I guess being
a pro hockey player

24:54.590 --> 24:56.558
you'd have first-hand
experience.

24:56.590 --> 24:58.729
- Puck bunnies and out-of-city
hotels go together

24:58.760 --> 25:00.853
like peanut butter
and jelly. So?

25:00.900 --> 25:04.563
- I've always liked
the visual arts.

25:04.600 --> 25:07.694
- You got busy with
Bryan the photographer?

25:07.740 --> 25:10.766
- I was celebrating.

25:13.980 --> 25:18.144
90 days. No ponies,
no cards, no slots.

25:18.180 --> 25:20.546
- This was the gift
you wanted to give Angie.

25:20.580 --> 25:23.048
- I haven't gone five days

25:23.080 --> 25:25.947
without placing a bet since...

25:25.990 --> 25:28.754
well, I don't even
know since when.

25:28.790 --> 25:32.749
And then I blew off that
coffee date with my daughter

25:32.790 --> 25:34.792
to place a couple
of bets at the track...

25:36.830 --> 25:38.764
Well, I knew...

25:38.800 --> 25:40.939
I knew it was time
to make a change.

25:40.970 --> 25:44.167
I went to Gambler's
Anonymous the next day.

25:44.210 --> 25:46.906
- So the 10 grand
in your purse?

25:46.940 --> 25:49.670
- Yeah. She was so angry
at the wedding, I...

25:53.980 --> 25:56.642
I know how to find
a game. I found one.

25:56.680 --> 25:58.648
Rode a hot streak.

25:58.690 --> 26:01.215
Went from 300 bucks
to 10 grand in two hours.

26:03.830 --> 26:07.027
- So you and Bryan...
who left the room first?

26:07.060 --> 26:10.097
- Well, I'm a firm believer
in "ladies first."

26:10.130 --> 26:13.759
But I wanted to powder my nose,

26:13.800 --> 26:17.031
and Bryan had to
get back to work.

26:17.070 --> 26:20.005
Matt, I did not steal the tiara.

26:20.040 --> 26:24.249
- I believe you, but unless
we can figure out who did...

26:26.710 --> 26:30.077
- Do me a favour.
Give these to Angie?

26:30.120 --> 26:32.816
Something to tell her that...

26:32.850 --> 26:35.057
well, for a little
while, aanay,

26:35.090 --> 26:37.081
I wasn't a total screw-up.

26:39.860 --> 26:41.828
- Give them to her yourself.

26:41.860 --> 26:43.828
I'm getting you out of here.

26:51.010 --> 26:53.831
- Yeah, you got
the wrong woman locked up.

26:53.880 --> 26:57.031
- She won big at cards,
but she doesn't want to rat
out the guy who runs the game.

26:57.080 --> 27:00.641
- Well, if she doesn't help
herself, we can't help her.

27:00.680 --> 27:03.911
Homicide wants to help.
His good luck runneth over.

27:03.950 --> 27:05.986
- It's not luck.

27:06.020 --> 27:09.251
- He asked Angie to go
to St Lucia. She said yes.

27:09.290 --> 27:11.850
- St. Lucia. Nice.

27:11.890 --> 27:13.994
Now, you want to help,
keep Nora out of prison.

27:14.030 --> 27:17.158
Lose some paperwork.

27:23.910 --> 27:25.935
Hey.
- Hey.

27:25.970 --> 27:28.302
Get a glass, we're
celebrating. The case is done.

27:28.340 --> 27:30.308
It was the Nora,

27:30.340 --> 27:33.070
in the bridal suite,
with the diamond tiara.

27:33.110 --> 27:35.840
- It's actually
pronounced "Mom,"

27:35.880 --> 27:38.280
and she didn't do it.

27:38.320 --> 27:41.380
Then what was she
doing in that room?

27:41.420 --> 27:44.025
- It's actually more
a question of who.

27:44.060 --> 27:47.723
: That's perfect.
That's just perfect.

27:47.760 --> 27:50.695
- She didn't want to tell you.
She thought you'd be
ashamed of her.

27:50.730 --> 27:52.721
- I'm way past that now.

27:52.770 --> 27:56.433
So who was the luclq
recipient of her bounty?

27:56.470 --> 27:59.303
- Bryan Pratt.

27:59.340 --> 28:02.104
Nice.

28:02.140 --> 28:04.301
Yeah. A May-December
Bonnie and Clyde.

28:04.350 --> 28:06.306
- You're looking
at this all wrong.

28:06.350 --> 28:09.217
Your mom and Bryan
alibi each other.

28:11.150 --> 28:13.118
So who's left?

28:13.150 --> 28:16.256
Ezra, Ezra, Ezra.
Think about it.

28:16.290 --> 28:19.020
He was in and out of the room.
He could have seen Kristy

28:19.060 --> 28:21.426
code the safe. And he leapt
at the thought of planning

28:21.460 --> 28:24.190
our wedding, once he saw
Aunt Lulu's sapphires.

28:24.230 --> 28:28.291
- Good luck with that. Really.
Let me know how it turns out.

28:28.340 --> 28:30.467
- Look, I know you're upset.

28:30.500 --> 28:32.468
But Nora's family.
And for better or worse,

28:32.510 --> 28:34.933
you don't give up on family.

28:36.940 --> 28:39.204
- One day I came
home from school.

28:39.250 --> 28:41.218
It was my 12th birthday
and she was there,

28:41.250 --> 28:43.889
cooking mac and cheese.
They were split up at the time,

28:43.920 --> 28:46.480
so that was weird,
but I was so happy

28:46.520 --> 28:49.318
to see her. So we
ate dinner together,

28:49.360 --> 28:52.488
both of us just acting like
that was perfectly normal.

28:52.530 --> 28:55.192
Happy birthday, right?

28:55.230 --> 28:59.166
Then she gave me 20 bucks
and said she had to go.

28:59.200 --> 29:01.862
I went down to my bedroom
and I put it in my piggy bank

29:01.900 --> 29:04.209
and that's when I found
out my bank was empty.

29:04.240 --> 29:07.300
She'd cleaned me out

29:07.340 --> 29:12.107
and given me my own
20 bucks back as a gift.

29:15.150 --> 29:17.118
You say, "Don't
give up on family."

29:17.150 --> 29:19.118
My mom gave up
on us a long time ago.

29:19.150 --> 29:22.950
- Everett...
- I don't know why
you're defending her.

29:22.990 --> 29:25.379
But so did my dad,
right until the day he died.

29:25.430 --> 29:27.421
If you want to keep chasing down
this case, you go right ahead,

29:27.460 --> 29:29.519
OK? Put on your big boy
P.I. pants and go for it.

29:29.560 --> 29:32.768
Just leave me out of it.

29:34.500 --> 29:36.491
Oh, hey. Don't forget this.

30:00.530 --> 30:02.521
***

30:22.220 --> 30:25.018
- Mr. Shade.

30:25.050 --> 30:27.587
_- You stole_ the tiara from_
Kristy. You rumed her wedding

30:27.620 --> 30:30.259
and maybe even her marriage.
- Let me explain.

30:30.290 --> 30:32.429
- Why does everyone always say
that? Let's just go retrieve

30:32.460 --> 30:34.257
the tiara, and then
we're calling the cops.

30:34.300 --> 30:37.497
- Mr. Shade, please. I'm here
looking for the Garveys' tiara.

30:37.530 --> 30:40.328
This is the ninth pawnshop
I've visited today.

30:40.370 --> 30:43.589
Yesterday the police
questioned me about the theft.

30:43.640 --> 30:46.108
It was the first
I'd heard of it.

30:46.140 --> 30:48.108
But sadly,
it's not the first time

30:48.140 --> 30:50.472
this has happened on my watch.

30:50.510 --> 30:53.343
- Hey, Kristy.

30:53.380 --> 30:56.315
I don't even know what to say.
Just that my mom...

30:58.320 --> 31:00.959
I want to apologize
to Robert's family.

31:00.990 --> 31:03.208
Um, can you just
explain to them that...

31:05.660 --> 31:08.026
...that Nora's
the one to blame here?

31:08.060 --> 31:10.358
Call me later,
so I know you're alright.

31:10.400 --> 31:13.289
Please.

31:19.510 --> 31:22.229
Oh, hey, Angie.

31:22.280 --> 31:26.148
Sorry for barging
in here. Is Matt here?

31:26.180 --> 31:28.910
- Uh, not since last night.

31:28.950 --> 31:31.384
Is everything OK?

31:33.550 --> 31:37.452
No. He wouldn't tell you.

31:37.490 --> 31:40.186
Uh...

31:40.230 --> 31:43.028
He got some bad news.

31:43.060 --> 31:46.166
And he has this habit

31:46.200 --> 31:49.590
of shutting it down,
like it never happened.

31:49.640 --> 31:52.108
And then later...

31:52.140 --> 31:54.335
Well, later's not so good.

31:57.440 --> 32:00.443
- Becca broke his heart.

32:00.480 --> 32:03.142
***

32:14.460 --> 32:16.655
- You were all about _the
Ezra, Ezra, Ezra last night.

32:16.700 --> 32:20.488
So I texted him.

32:20.530 --> 32:23.169
- Your dad came to visit.
He's worried about you.

32:23.200 --> 32:26.260
- Yeah, my dad needs a hobby.
- He told me about Jules.

32:26.310 --> 32:28.301
How Becca wan_ts
full custody again.

32:28.340 --> 32:31.309
- I don't want to talk about it.
- OK...

32:31.350 --> 32:33.705
Well, then, I will. 'Cause
I know you love your daughter

32:33.750 --> 32:38.141
and you want to see her
as much as possible.

32:38.190 --> 32:41.182
- Becca wants me back at
"every other weekend" status

32:41.220 --> 32:44.155
and she wants me to be
the one to tell Jules.

32:44.190 --> 32:46.385
- Then you might have to.

32:46.430 --> 32:48.398
- I thought you were on my side.

32:48.430 --> 32:50.625
- I think what Becca's
d0ing is wrong,

32:50.660 --> 32:53.128
but you've seen
what it looks like

32:53.170 --> 32:55.491
when a daughter hates her
mother. You have to ask yourself

32:55.540 --> 32:58.464
if you really want to see that
happen between Jules and Becca.

32:58.510 --> 33:00.762
You've been trying
to save Nora when I wouldn't.

33:00.810 --> 33:04.678
I'm just suggesting
you save Becca too.

33:04.710 --> 33:06.678
I know it's a stretch,

33:06.710 --> 33:10.669
but it turns out
you're good at it.

33:10.720 --> 33:13.143
- Maybe.
- You're out here chasing clues

33:13.190 --> 33:15.408
after I gave up.
- Oh, speaking of which.

33:15.460 --> 33:17.587
Ezra told me about another theft
that happened at a wedding

33:17.620 --> 33:19.554
he was running.
Same MO, different hotel.

33:19.590 --> 33:23.253
- Then it couldn't
have been Nora.

33:23.300 --> 33:25.791
- Don't go down that road. You
were trying to help your cousin.

33:25.830 --> 33:28.139
- Yeah, and you were trying
to help both of them.

33:28.170 --> 33:30.092
- It's not too late for
you to jump back on board.

33:32.770 --> 33:35.637
- Yeah. Let's do this.

33:35.680 --> 33:39.400
Alright. According to Ezra,
these are the vendors

33:41.720 --> 33:44.280
- But Maddie and Mycroft weren't
interested in our wedding,

33:44.320 --> 33:46.288
despite Aunt Lulu's sapphires.

33:46.320 --> 33:49.517
- Gary was in the suite at least
once, going over the set
list with the bride.

33:49.560 --> 33:51.778
- Bryan was Kristy's shadow.
He was in and out of the suite

33:51.830 --> 33:54.219
taking photos, including
when Kristy put the tiara

33:54.260 --> 33:57.127
in the safe.
- Not to mention he came
back later for an f-stop.

33:57.160 --> 33:59.799
- After that, we're
looking at a window

33:59.830 --> 34:02.799
between 3:50 and 4:10 pm.

34:04.840 --> 34:06.705
How would the thief know
when it was safe to go in?

34:06.740 --> 34:09.208
- The first dance.

34:09.240 --> 34:11.549
Everyone watches
the first dance.

34:11.580 --> 34:13.673
It's the only time all day

34:13.710 --> 34:15.849
when everyone is guaranteed
to be in one place.

34:15.880 --> 34:17.609
- Kristy told me a lot of
details about the wedding,

34:17.650 --> 34:21.313
but she didn't tell me their_
song, because they wanted it
to be a surprise for everyone.

34:21.360 --> 34:23.385
- But Gary knew. He could
have used it as a signal

34:23.420 --> 34:26.184
to an accomplice. "All clear."
- When we interviewed Gary,

34:26.230 --> 34:28.698
the only person he recommended
was Sherry and vice versa.

34:28.730 --> 34:30.698
- Yeah, but you said it
yourself. She was long gone

34:30.730 --> 34:33.290
by the time
the reception started.

34:33.330 --> 34:37.664
- But maybe she left
behind a souvenir.

34:37.700 --> 34:40.737
A bit of foundation powder
dusted on the keys of the safe.

34:40.770 --> 34:44.103
Then when Kristy touched
the keys, it would show the
numbers in her combination.

34:44.150 --> 34:46.368
- How long would it take
to crack a four

34:46.410 --> 34:49.709
- 4 times 3 times 2,
so 24 possibilities.

34:49.750 --> 34:52.787
- I'm guessing a lot less
time than the first dance.

34:54.720 --> 34:56.688
- Cute couple.

34:56.720 --> 34:59.883
- Maybe Ezra knows
where we can find them.

34:59.930 --> 35:02.319
***

35:02.360 --> 35:06.729
- ** Darling, you send me

35:06.770 --> 35:10.160
* I know you send me

35:10.200 --> 35:12.407
: It's the first dance!

35:12.440 --> 35:15.375
: Oh, hurry!
- Come on, it's the first dance!

35:15.410 --> 35:18.538
- * Honest you do,
honest you do *

35:18.580 --> 35:20.673
- This song usually
lasts for three minutes.

35:20.710 --> 35:22.678
- Ezra arranged for the
concierge to give us a key.

35:22.720 --> 35:25.883
- Wait! I'd like to
handle this. It's family.

35:25.920 --> 35:29.219
- Alright.
I'll watch the crooner.

35:29.260 --> 35:31.626
- * You thrill me

35:47.240 --> 35:49.208
- Yes!

35:49.240 --> 35:52.471
- Neat little gadget
you've got here.

35:52.510 --> 35:55.240
I've used them to break into the
occa5ional hotel room myself.

35:55.280 --> 35:58.647
But the powder on the safe,
that was impressive.

36:00.790 --> 36:02.587
You mess with my family,
you mess with me.

36:02.620 --> 36:05.259
- * I know, I know, I know

36:05.290 --> 36:08.623
* You, you, you, you send me

36:08.660 --> 36:12.266
* I know you

36:12.300 --> 36:14.393
* Send me

36:14.440 --> 36:18.661
* I know you, you, you,
you send me *

36:18.710 --> 36:21.406
* Honest you do *

36:25.510 --> 36:28.673
- Hey, Gary. Do you
guys take requests?

36:28.720 --> 36:30.517
- Sure, man. What'd
you have in mind?

36:30.550 --> 36:34.213
- Do you know
anything by The Police?

36:38.630 --> 36:41.190
Let's not do anything
to spoil their day, OK?

36:51.040 --> 36:53.463
***

36:54.610 --> 36:57.909
- I trust that you can get
this to the Garvey from
whence it came?

36:57.940 --> 37:00.500
- I can! Thank you.

37:00.550 --> 37:03.246
- Just doing my job.

37:03.280 --> 37:05.589
- I'm sorry it took
so long to get it.

37:05.620 --> 37:07.611
- Angie, you and
Shade were amazing.

37:07.650 --> 37:09.550
You have no need
to apologize about it.

37:09.590 --> 37:11.558
- But Robert and his parents...

37:11.590 --> 37:14.821
- That's exactly the thing I
screwed up. I hate that I lied.

37:14.860 --> 37:17.590
They got it!

37:17.630 --> 37:19.860
We got it!

37:21.870 --> 37:25.738
Muffin!

37:28.040 --> 37:30.008
- Love triumphs again.

37:30.040 --> 37:32.008
It's like they always say:

37:32.050 --> 37:34.314
a tiara in a freezer bag
heals all wounds.

37:34.350 --> 37:36.818
You've heard that, right?

37:36.850 --> 37:39.341
Where's your lesser half?

37:39.390 --> 37:41.585
- He had some family business.

37:41.620 --> 37:44.453
Speaking of which,
is she still here?

37:44.490 --> 37:46.458
- Well, you know,
since she's your family,

37:46.490 --> 37:49.755
I had no choice but to
expedite her release papers.

37:49.800 --> 37:51.927
- Thank you.

37:55.670 --> 37:58.764
- 90 days.

37:58.810 --> 38:02.632
And then I blew it.

38:02.680 --> 38:06.468
- If you did it once, Mom,
you can do it again.

38:06.510 --> 38:08.842
I'm sure of it.

38:08.880 --> 38:11.383
Come on. Let's get
you out of here.

38:36.440 --> 38:38.943
- Hey, honey.
- Hi.

38:38.980 --> 38:41.813
- Hey, um...

38:41.850 --> 38:46.082
You _remember how we were
talking about Niagara Falls?

38:48.860 --> 38:51.954
- I was thinking, um...

38:53.990 --> 38:56.390
What if you took that
trip with your mom?

38:56.430 --> 38:59.661
I don't know if you've noticed,
but she's pretty nervous

38:59.700 --> 39:02.567
about this new job.

39:02.600 --> 39:05.068
- Well, she seems more
excited than nervous.

39:05.110 --> 39:07.431
- That's 'cause she's a good
mom. She doesn't want you

39:07.470 --> 39:10.371
to worry. But I can
see right through her.

39:10.410 --> 39:14.414
I think she's gonna
need some extra attention

39:14.450 --> 39:16.839
for the next little while.
- Well, she is.

39:16.880 --> 39:18.848
We're going 50

39:18.890 --> 39:21.984
- Maybe, instead of 50-50,

39:22.020 --> 39:24.625
we should go back
to the old arrangement.

39:26.630 --> 39:28.791
- So...

39:28.830 --> 39:32.163
So you want to go back

39:32.200 --> 39:34.964
to seeing me
every other weekend?

39:35.000 --> 39:36.558
And sometimes not even?

39:36.600 --> 39:41.037
- No, honey, that's not
what I want. That's not what
I want at all. Think about it.

39:41.070 --> 39:44.073
Your mom's condo has a pool
and it's near the shopping mall.

39:44.110 --> 39:46.874
It's near your school...

39:46.910 --> 39:48.878
You'll love it there.

39:48.920 --> 39:51.889
- I suppose you're not even
going to miss me, right?

39:51.920 --> 39:54.115
- Honey, I miss you already.

39:54.150 --> 39:56.459
You're not even gone yet.

40:04.900 --> 40:06.891
- It's OK, Dad. I get it.

40:06.930 --> 40:10.934
Sometimes you have
to make a sacrifice play.

40:15.780 --> 40:20.046
Can you hold on to this
until I get back?

40:20.080 --> 40:22.048
- Sure.

40:22.080 --> 40:24.048
What does it say?

40:24.080 --> 40:27.914
- "Keep your head up
and your heart strong."

40:27.950 --> 40:31.784
- Yeah, I can do that.

40:31.830 --> 40:34.890
- Me too.

40:48.610 --> 40:51.670
- ** My mama said

40:51.710 --> 40:53.701
- * My mama said

40:53.750 --> 40:58.039
- * Ooh, let her go

40:58.080 --> 41:01.083
- * Let her go

41:01.120 --> 41:03.953
- Thought you were gone already.
- Nolan's picking me up.

41:03.990 --> 41:06.129
The flight doesn't leave
for a couple of hours.

41:06.160 --> 41:09.698
Jules?
- She's going.

41:09.730 --> 41:11.698
For now.

41:11.730 --> 41:14.528
I think she figured it out
while I was falling on my sword.

41:14.570 --> 41:16.834
- She's a smart kid.

41:16.870 --> 41:19.532
Just like her old man.

41:19.570 --> 41:21.902
- Are you telling me
I did something right?

41:21.940 --> 41:24.204
- Helped my cousin.
Saved my mom.

41:24.240 --> 41:26.572
I think you're getting
the hang of this thing.

41:26.610 --> 41:29.579
In fact...

41:29.620 --> 41:31.611
- Matt Shade...

41:31.650 --> 41:34.551
Will you take this key to what
used to be my dad's office

41:34.590 --> 41:37.514
and be my full-on,
P.I. agency partner?

41:37.560 --> 41:40.688
- Don't get ahead of yourself.

41:40.730 --> 41:42.698
Will you?

41:42.730 --> 41:45.198
- I will. I do.

41:45.230 --> 41:48.267
I am. Whoa!

41:48.300 --> 41:50.791
You're not going to try
to kiss me again, are you?

41:50.840 --> 41:53.809
- You weren't that good.
- Yeah.

41:53.840 --> 41:56.604
- Never had any
complaints before.

42:00.680 --> 42:02.716
- I'll just get my bag!
- You're funny.

42:02.750 --> 42:04.718
Damn, girl. How many
bikinis you got in there?

42:04.750 --> 42:07.548
- Enough.

42:07.590 --> 42:10.684
- * I say goodbye

42:10.720 --> 42:13.587
-*Icry

42:13.630 --> 42:16.895
- Hey, you two try
not to kill each other.

42:16.930 --> 42:19.023
- It's not like
I'm going with you.

42:25.810 --> 42:29.075
- * Time, you don't
really fix a thing *

42:29.110 --> 42:31.203
* Oh, no, no

42:31.240 --> 42:36.109
* Time, you don't
really mend no hearts *

42:36.150 --> 42:40.041
* You just got us
convinced that you *

42:40.090 --> 42:43.184
* You'll take care of it after

42:43.220 --> 42:46.121
* The hardest part

42:46.160 --> 42:48.958
* All you need is

42:49.000 --> 42:53.960
* Time, time, time, time

42:54.000 --> 42:57.731
- * Time, time, time,
time, time, time *

42:57.770 --> 43:01.809
- * Ooh, all you need is time

43:01.840 --> 43:04.900
- * Time, give it time

43:04.950 --> 43:07.669
- * All you need is time

43:07.710 --> 43:09.871
- * Time, time, time,
time, time, time *

43:09.920 --> 43:12.718
- * All you need is time

43:12.750 --> 43:15.878
- * Time, give it time *

43:23.100 --> 43:26.069
***
