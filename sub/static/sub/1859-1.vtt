- I'm in Eastern fucking Europe.</i>

16:51.177 --> 16:54.179
<i>I left the States three years ago,
which was your idea in the first place remember that.</i>

16:54.347 --> 16:55.764
<i>I remember.</i>

16:55.973 --> 16:58.475
<i>It was to get away from my family
I`ll never going back.</i>

16:58.601 --> 17:03.313
<i>Why? Because I like to cook.
And like to be alone. That's it.</i>

17:03.481 --> 17:05.107
<i>Well, you got both your wishes.</i>

17:05.273 --> 17:07.733
<i>Nobody comes to the restaurant
nobody eats your food.</i>

17:07.902 --> 17:11.695
<i>Now you just wish for that you never get laid
and all three wishes will be up.</i>

17:44.605 --> 17:46.231
<i>Anthony?</i>

17:46.399 --> 17:47.732
<i>Mm?</i>

17:47.900 --> 17:50.152
<i>Can I get a glass of water?</i>

17:50.319 --> 17:52.529
<i>No, you're gonna piss on my couch.</i>

17:57.952 --> 18:02.080
<i>I know I told you
to get away from your family,</i>

18:02.248 --> 18:04.291
<i>go travel, live your life,</i>

18:04.459 --> 18:08.378
<i>but you're here with your restaurant
just hiding from the world, man.</i>

18:08.546 --> 18:12.799
<i>I need you in on this.
And you need to live your life.</i>

18:12.967 --> 18:14.509
<i>So, you in on this, man?</i>

18:14.635 --> 18:18.221
<i>You going to get with me?
Come on, man, be a dick.</i>

18:21.976 --> 18:23.518
<i>All right.</i>

18:23.644 --> 18:26.271
<i>If it doesn't work,
you're waiting tables.</i>

18:26.439 --> 18:28.273
<i>- We're gonna do this?
- I'm with you.</i>

18:28.441 --> 18:30.525
<i>- We can! Yes, we can!
- We'll try.</i>

18:30.651 --> 18:34.070
<i>Come on, you feel me!
My boy! Bros before hos.</i>

18:34.238 --> 18:36.740
<i>- I don't have any hos.
- That's on my list.</i>

18:36.908 --> 18:38.617
<i>You gonna get some hos.</i>

18:38.784 --> 18:40.827
<i>It's, er, wait.</i>

18:40.995 --> 18:43.705
<i>"Bonjour". It's right here.
Come on, here we go.</i>

18:44.332 --> 18:45.707
<i>This is it.</i>

18:46.751 --> 18:48.543
<i>Oh, yes!</i>

18:48.669 --> 18:51.713
<i>Yes! Dude, that's Santa Claus.</i>

18:51.881 --> 18:54.090
<i>They're showing
Christmas movies.</i>

18:54.258 --> 18:57.469
<i>A porno theatre.
Our office is in a porno theatre.</i>

18:57.595 --> 19:01.181
<i>Dude, you think Ben and Jerry
started off in a high rise creamery?</i>

19:01.349 --> 19:05.769
<i>No, not at all. They had
one big spoon, one bucket,</i>

19:05.937 --> 19:08.897
<i>in the back of a VW van,
creaming in their pants.</i>

19:09.106 --> 19:11.399
<i>Ground up, Anthony, ground up.</i>

19:11.567 --> 19:14.861
<i>Hey, you wanna watch the movie,</i>

19:15.029 --> 19:16.696
<i>you need to buy a ticket.</i>

19:16.864 --> 19:18.657
<i>Er, let's see.</i>

19:18.824 --> 19:21.785
<i>We're looking for a... Boden.</i>

19:21.953 --> 19:24.538
<i>Ah, Boda? It's me.</i>

19:24.664 --> 19:26.498
<i>Come on, guys, come on.</i>

19:26.624 --> 19:30.752
<i>This is your office.
You make here much money.</i>

19:30.920 --> 19:35.757
<i>You have all you need here.
Big desk, free porno.</i>

19:37.051 --> 19:39.928
<i>Careful, careful. Boards rotten.</i>

19:40.137 --> 19:43.223
<i>Here, you can put the papers.</i>

19:43.391 --> 19:45.267
<i>And this is very important place.</i>

19:45.434 --> 19:47.852
<i>You can wash here or piss here.</i>

19:48.020 --> 19:49.771
<i>Everybody must piss, yes.</i>

19:49.939 --> 19:55.443
<i>500 of month, but, er,
for you, because I like your face,</i>

19:55.611 --> 19:58.697
<i>I give to you for four, OK?</i>

19:58.864 --> 20:00.574
<i>We'll take it.</i>

20:00.700 --> 20:02.409
<i>Good guys.</i>

20:02.577 --> 20:04.619
<i>- Yes.
- Come on, pay him.</i>

20:04.745 --> 20:07.163
<i>- Er, yes, come on.
- You ready to wait tables?</i>

20:07.331 --> 20:08.832
<i>Ground up, ground up.</i>

20:09.000 --> 20:11.167
<i>- You make here big success.
- Ah.</i>

20:11.335 --> 20:14.504
<i>- Enjoy.
- Thank you.</i>

20:14.672 --> 20:17.173
<i>So we have
an uninhabitable hovel</i>

20:17.341 --> 20:19.301
<i>overlooking
a Santa Claus snuff film.</i>

20:19.468 --> 20:20.969
<i>What's next?</i>

20:21.178 --> 20:22.637
<i>Staff.</i>

20:22.763 --> 20:25.056
<i>You know,
I was in Army language school.</i>

20:25.266 --> 20:27.267
<i>I speak five different languages.</i>

20:27.435 --> 20:30.770
<i>- Um, do you mind if we ask, Mr...
- Call me Dexter.</i>

20:36.360 --> 20:40.196
<i>OK, er, Dexter, um, how did you...?</i>

20:40.364 --> 20:42.532
<i>Well, I mean,
were you born like this?</i>

20:42.658 --> 20:45.076
<i>- He was in the Army.
- Oh. Oh, no.</i>

20:45.286 --> 20:46.870
<i>Shortly after I was discharged,</i>

20:47.038 --> 20:49.873
<i>my wife and I
were vacationing in Florida,</i>

20:50.041 --> 20:52.000
<i>and we were involved
in a shark attack.</i>

20:52.209 --> 20:55.503
<i>Um, so that's how you lost...?</i>

20:55.671 --> 20:58.173
<i>- Oh, no, shark ate my wife.
- Oh, God.</i>

20:58.341 --> 21:02.010
<i>Have you ever seen somebody
you love eaten alive slowly,</i>

21:02.219 --> 21:03.887
<i>one bite at a time?</i>

21:04.055 --> 21:05.805
<i>Er, he didn't eat her whole?</i>

21:05.973 --> 21:09.559
<i>Oh, they found her hole. And
a piece of her ass on the beach.</i>

21:09.685 --> 21:12.062
<i>Just an empty thong
and a broken dream.</i>

21:12.271 --> 21:14.105
<i>You know,
that hits you kinda hard.</i>

21:14.315 --> 21:16.900
<i>I started drinking heavily
and using intravenous drugs.</i>

21:17.068 --> 21:21.529
<i>Lost my arm through
an abscess caused by a dirty needle.</i>

21:21.697 --> 21:24.574
<i>I reached rock bottom
about five years ago.</i>

21:24.700 --> 21:27.911
<i>I was living on the streets
and begging and eating pet food.</i>

21:28.079 --> 21:33.416
<i>Finally, I just threw myself
under a subway train,</i>

21:33.584 --> 21:37.712
<i>and landed on the rails,
and well, that train just, whoosh!</i>

21:37.838 --> 21:39.631
<i>Popped my legs clean off.</i>

21:39.757 --> 21:42.008
<i>Well, listen,
you seem remarkably positive.</i>

21:42.218 --> 21:45.345
<i>I thank God every day
for what happened to me.</i>

21:45.513 --> 21:48.431
<i>You know, my accident,
well, it brought me to the Lord.</i>

21:48.599 --> 21:52.143
<i>I stopped drinking and drugging.</i>

21:52.353 --> 21:54.729
<i>I promised myself
that I would make the most</i>

21:54.897 --> 21:58.441
<i>out of every single opportunity
that life afforded me.</i>

21:58.609 --> 22:00.068
<i>OK, well, I guess, um,</i>

22:00.277 --> 22:04.322
<i>practically speaking, could you
maybe fill some of the requirements?</i>

22:04.490 --> 22:06.699
<i>You see that phone over there?</i>

22:06.826 --> 22:09.035
<i>Ring! Ring!</i>

22:15.793 --> 22:19.254
<i>And I make
a great cup of coffee, too.</i>

22:20.965 --> 22:22.590
<i>Well, when can you start?</i>

22:23.592 --> 22:25.093
<i>Give me a little nub.</i>

22:28.472 --> 22:29.931
<i>Hello?</i>

22:30.099 --> 22:32.767
<i>Daniel Carver? This is Cat.</i>

22:32.935 --> 22:35.395
<i>Cat, where are you?
I'm so glad you're alive.</i>

22:35.563 --> 22:38.898
<i>- How did you get my number?
- I copied Ryder's address book.</i>

22:39.066 --> 22:41.860
<i>How very industrious.
So what is this about?</i>

22:42.027 --> 22:43.736
<i>Wanted to touch base?</i>

22:43.863 --> 22:46.030
<i>I have your hard drive, OK?</i>

22:46.198 --> 22:47.866
<i>If you don't call off your dogs,</i>

22:48.033 --> 22:49.576
<i>that movie of your boss will be</i>

22:49.743 --> 22:52.495
<i>the most-watched video
on YouTube.</i>

22:55.082 --> 22:56.791
<i>Turn off the fucking music!</i>

22:56.917 --> 22:59.002
<i>Oh!</i>

23:08.596 --> 23:10.930
<i>You can't get anything
off that hard drive sweetie.</i>

23:11.098 --> 23:13.057
<i>It's got level 5 military encryption.</i>

23:13.225 --> 23:17.020
<i>It's gonna purge itself like
a Russian farm worker on Easter.</i>

23:17.188 --> 23:19.647
<i>That`s why I took it to an expert.
He figured it out.</i>

23:19.815 --> 23:21.483
<i>Never lie to grown-ups sweetie.</i>

23:21.650 --> 23:24.194
<i>I'm old enough
to be your sugar daddy.</i>

23:24.403 --> 23:27.822
<i>And I'll find you.
I'll find you by the pm.</i>

23:32.119 --> 23:33.828
<i>Fuck.</i>

23:54.767 --> 23:58.853
<i>I found a car.
Someone left it on the street.</i>

23:58.979 --> 24:01.856
<i>I could get 300 - 400 Euros for it,
I'm sure.</i>

24:02.024 --> 24:04.692
<i>I don't know whose it is, don't care.</i>

24:06.278 --> 24:08.863
<i>Away! Away from the car!
Away, you dirty shit!</i>

24:09.031 --> 24:11.741
<i>I said get away from the car!</i>

24:11.867 --> 24:15.870
<i>Get away from the car</i>

24:28.050 --> 24:30.927
<i>What? What did you do?
Are you crazy?</i>

24:31.095 --> 24:33.972
<i>- You stupid fuck.
- You said to kill the driver.</i>

24:34.139 --> 24:35.848
<i>No said boy or girl.</i>

24:35.975 --> 24:37.517
<i>- You killed a cop?
- Yah.</i>

24:37.685 --> 24:40.270
<i>You won't get paid for this.
Fuckers!</i>

24:40.479 --> 24:41.938
<i>Shoot him.</i>

24:42.731 --> 24:46.442
<i>OK, now I'm really
annoyed with you, princess.</i>

24:46.610 --> 24:48.861
<i>It's time to bring in a professional.</i>

24:48.988 --> 24:52.031
<i>Plan B. As in Bingham.</i>

25:09.883 --> 25:12.844
<i>- It`s all good to see you, Helen.
- Thanks for thinking of me.</i>

25:18.642 --> 25:21.311
<i>I'm always thinking of you.</i>

25:22.896 --> 25:24.856
<i>- How's Maria?
- She's fine.</i>

25:24.982 --> 25:27.233
<i>And Eliska?
What is she now? Three?</i>

25:27.443 --> 25:30.278
<i>- Three and a half.
- How lovely.</i>

25:30.487 --> 25:32.530
<i>You know Razwell?</i>

25:32.698 --> 25:35.158
<i>Of course,
since he was in short pants.</i>

25:35.326 --> 25:37.076
<i>Hello, Helen.</i>

25:38.162 --> 25:40.705
<i>Oh, still using
Aqua di Parma, Bob?</i>

25:40.873 --> 25:42.874
<i>Old habits die hard.</i>

25:43.000 --> 25:45.710
<i>A real man never changes
his cologne. Shall we?</i>

25:45.878 --> 25:49.213
<i>The hard drive
has a level-five encryption.</i>

25:49.423 --> 25:52.216
<i>She won't be able
to get anything out of it.</i>

25:52.426 --> 25:54.927
<i>And yet, you'll pay top euro
to get it back.</i>

25:55.095 --> 25:56.888
<i>What's on the hard drive, Daniel?</i>

25:57.014 --> 25:58.848
<i>- Baby pictures.
- Hm.</i>

25:58.974 --> 26:03.478
<i>That's need-to-know, Helen.
Trust me, you don't need to know.</i>

26:03.646 --> 26:06.105
<i>And the girl?
What do we know about her?</i>

26:06.273 --> 26:07.732
<i>Bob?</i>

26:09.485 --> 26:11.027
<i>Thank you.</i>

26:11.195 --> 26:15.073
<i>Her name is Catalina Rona,
also answers to Cat.</i>

26:15.240 --> 26:19.452
<i>Left her rustic, rural homeland
of Andorra looking for work,</i>

26:19.620 --> 26:23.331
<i>and found her true calling
sprawling and balling.</i>

26:23.540 --> 26:25.958
<i>Oh, my goodness.</i>

26:26.126 --> 26:27.835
<i>What else do we know?</i>

26:27.961 --> 26:31.172
<i>- Well, we know she's smart.
- And how do we know that?</i>

26:31.340 --> 26:33.383
<i>- Because she's still breathing.
- Ah.</i>

26:37.054 --> 26:40.807
<i>And those other girls, the ones who
weren't quite as smart as Catalina?</i>

26:40.974 --> 26:42.850
<i>What are your plans for their future?</i>

26:42.976 --> 26:46.354
<i>Car crash, drug paraphernalia,
bodies burned up, local cops.</i>

26:46.563 --> 26:47.980
<i>The chief is on my payroll.</i>

26:48.148 --> 26:50.149
<i>Dear me. Pull!</i>

26:52.778 --> 26:55.113
<i>I thought you boys
were all about change now.</i>

26:55.280 --> 26:56.698
<i>Oh, we have changed.</i>

26:56.865 --> 26:59.784
<i>We used to be
really cold and ruthless. Pull.</i>

27:25.978 --> 27:27.937
<i>Do you need a hand with that?</i>

27:28.063 --> 27:29.439
<i>No, no!</i>

27:29.815 --> 27:31.774
<i>Oh, I think you do.</i>

28:23.744 --> 28:25.077
<i>Mr Rona?</i>

28:25.245 --> 28:28.331
<i>Mr Rona,
I want to assure you, Mr Rona,</i>

28:28.499 --> 28:30.082
<i>that we're just as concerned</i>

28:30.250 --> 28:32.752
<i>about Catalina's disappearance
as you are.</i>

28:32.920 --> 28:36.756
<i>Oh, yes? That mean
you're not much concerned.</i>

28:36.924 --> 28:39.091
<i>You're not worried
about your daughter?</i>

28:39.259 --> 28:42.887
<i>What to worry? I never see her.
And she never gives me a dime.</i>

28:43.055 --> 28:45.932
<i>She fuck and make big money,
but none for Papa.</i>

28:46.141 --> 28:48.392
<i>- Who's the bitch?
- She is from the police.</i>

28:48.602 --> 28:50.520
<i>Her name is Virginia Wolf.
This is my boy son.</i>

28:50.729 --> 28:52.855
<i>How lovely to meet you.
Do you happen to know</i>

28:53.023 --> 28:54.524
<i>where your girl sister is?</i>

28:54.733 --> 28:57.860
<i>- I know nothing.
- imagine that.</i>

28:58.028 --> 28:59.821
<i>If you do happen to hear anything,</i>

28:59.988 --> 29:02.990
<i>I would most appreciate it
if you'd give me a call.</i>

29:03.116 --> 29:06.369
<i>Why is she wasting her time
looking for my sister?</i>

29:06.537 --> 29:08.496
<i>She won't hide long.
She's got a kid.</i>

29:08.705 --> 29:13.084
<i>Ah. Si? Garcia’s.</i>

29:38.944 --> 29:40.736
<i>Hold it.</i>

29:48.287 --> 29:51.664
<i>Ooh, we need an elevator.
All these damn stairs.</i>

29:54.418 --> 29:57.420
<i>- Hey, sorry I'm late.
- Late for what?</i>

29:57.588 --> 29:59.839
<i>Dexter Wolf, any, er, messages?</i>

30:01.091 --> 30:03.050
<i>Er, Boda called,</i>

30:03.176 --> 30:06.554
<i>and he said that Swedish
penis pump you ordered,</i>

30:06.763 --> 30:09.265
<i>he's going to deliver it to you
in a discreet package.</i>

30:09.433 --> 30:12.143
<i>Er, I meant, like business messages.</i>

30:12.269 --> 30:16.022
<i>- Am I paying for your porn?
- No, man, I didn't even order that.</i>

30:16.189 --> 30:18.024
<i>I'm a victim of identity theft.</i>

30:18.191 --> 30:21.319
<i>Anyways, man, I got some new
business cards and cell phones.</i>

30:21.486 --> 30:23.821
<i>- Here, check it out.
- Let's see.</i>

30:25.032 --> 30:29.035
<i>"Looking for a good dick?
Call the Juan Detective Agency."</i>

30:29.202 --> 30:31.329
<i>- Who's Juan?
- No, no, no, no. It's "Ju-An".</i>

30:31.496 --> 30:34.081
<i>It's a cross, like hybrids,
like a mix with our names,</i>

30:34.207 --> 30:36.792
<i>Julian and Anthony. Ju-An.
You feel me?</i>

30:36.960 --> 30:40.379
<i>- Why's your name first?
- because Anju sounds like a law firm.</i>

30:40.547 --> 30:42.965
<i>You know,
Goldman Goldman Sachs Anju.</i>

30:43.133 --> 30:44.634
<i>I mean, if you don't like it,</i>

30:44.843 --> 30:47.929
<i>I can go back
and maybe reprint something.</i>

30:48.096 --> 30:51.557
<i>Is this your only objection?
Are we doing this?</i>

30:53.644 --> 30:55.353
<i>Yes!</i>

30:55.520 --> 30:57.355
<i>Check this out.</i>

30:57.522 --> 30:59.315
<i>What the hell does that say?</i>

30:59.483 --> 31:01.734
<i>That's the girl from the restaurant.</i>

31:01.902 --> 31:05.571
<i>Father's looking for his missing
daughter. She's our first case.</i>

31:17.668 --> 31:22.380
<i>The next ferry to Bari, ltaly
leaves in eight minutes.</i>

31:22.547 --> 31:24.090
<i>Please board now.</i>

31:24.257 --> 31:27.426
<i>This is the last call
for the ferry to Bari, ltaly,</i>

31:27.594 --> 31:30.012
<i>leaving in eight minutes.</i>

31:30.180 --> 31:32.431
<i>Please board now.</i>

31:38.855 --> 31:40.982
<i>Come on, wake up, honey.</i>

31:41.149 --> 31:42.566
<i>Ow.</i>

31:42.776 --> 31:45.027
<i>Where are we?</i>

31:45.195 --> 31:47.238
<i>Ancona, ltaly.</i>

31:47.364 --> 31:48.990
<i>Oh, I fell asleep.</i>

31:49.157 --> 31:51.784
<i>Good. Now you can go all night.</i>

32:10.220 --> 32:12.513
<i>- You wanted it!
- What happened?</i>

32:13.640 --> 32:15.933
<i>It was an accident.
I didn't do anything.</i>

32:17.394 --> 32:18.853
<i>- Go.
- It was an accident.</i>

32:19.021 --> 32:20.688
<i>Go. Go.</i>

32:32.284 --> 32:35.286
<i>Their safety
is our number one priority.</i>

32:35.412 --> 32:36.829
<i>Safety.</i>

32:56.099 --> 32:58.267
<i>- What the fuck?
- We are not in ltaly.</i>

32:58.393 --> 33:01.062
<i>We couldn't.
There were too many cops.</i>

33:01.229 --> 33:04.231
<i>They were looking in the trunks
of the cars. We'll go tomorrow.</i>

33:04.357 --> 33:07.068
<i>We'll spend the night here
and we`ll go tomorrow. I promise you.</i>

33:07.235 --> 33:11.363
<i>- We`ll go to Italy, It'll be completely all right.
- I don't think so.</i>

33:11.531 --> 33:13.574
<i>Your dream girI's getting pretty famous.</i>

33:13.742 --> 33:16.911
<i>Father's really upset his baby
didn't come home for supper.</i>

33:17.079 --> 33:19.371
<i>- Is that objectionable?
- It's bullshit. that`s what it is.</i>

33:19.498 --> 33:22.041
<i>First of all, She's not a kind of a girl
who comes home for supper</i>

33:22.209 --> 33:24.668
<i>Second of all, since when shit like this
make the headlines?</i>

33:24.878 --> 33:26.629
<i>Which leads us to conclude what?</i>

33:26.797 --> 33:29.715
<i>Some very hard, very bad people,
connected and respected are fronting</i>

33:29.925 --> 33:32.593
<i>and want her found
before she can make a sound.</i>

33:32.761 --> 33:34.887
<i>Oh, MC Dr Seuss, kicking rhymes!</i>

33:35.055 --> 33:37.389
<i>I'm just saying,
something is not right here.</i>

33:37.557 --> 33:40.684
<i>A bunch of stuff ain't right in a world.
and you suddenly care cause what?</i>

33:40.894 --> 33:42.895
<i>I'm just curious, that's all.</i>

33:43.063 --> 33:46.148
<i>I knew it! You want to
have sex with her, don't you?</i>

33:46.316 --> 33:49.026
<i>- What are you talking about?
- You want to hit that.</i>

33:49.194 --> 33:51.403
<i>It's cool by me you know what.
It's our first case.</i>

33:51.530 --> 33:54.156
<i>Come on, let's catch our train.
Come on.</i>

34:05.335 --> 34:08.587
<i>- Mr Ryder? Good afternoon.
- You work for Carver?</i>

34:08.755 --> 34:11.382
<i>- I do.
- You got some answers about the girls of mine?</i>

34:11.507 --> 34:13.842
<i>I was hoping you could
help me on that score.</i>

34:14.052 --> 34:15.719
<i>You see,
one of your girls, Catalina,</i>

34:15.929 --> 34:18.013
<i>has stolen something
from my employer.</i>

34:18.181 --> 34:21.350
<i>I need to know if you've heard
from her and where she might be.</i>

34:21.476 --> 34:23.643
<i>I don't know
where that scheiss bitch is.</i>

34:23.812 --> 34:27.648
<i>Where the fuck are the others?
Debbie, Susie, Bubbles, Sabina?</i>

34:27.815 --> 34:29.859
<i>I'm afraid I have no idea.</i>

34:30.068 --> 34:32.360
<i>Then we've both got
no fucking idea.</i>

34:32.487 --> 34:37.032
<i>Well, perhaps you could tell me
who Catalina left her baby with?</i>

34:40.120 --> 34:44.873
<i>Lady, look at you. You come in
here, Mary fucking Poppins.</i>

34:45.083 --> 34:49.378
<i>You've got a brass pussy,
but no offense, get fucked, mama.</i>

34:49.504 --> 34:51.463
<i>Oh, I'm not your mama, I'm afraid.</i>

34:51.590 --> 34:53.465
<i>I would love to have
a son like you,</i>

34:53.632 --> 34:56.342
<i>but no such luck, poor old me.</i>

34:56.469 --> 35:00.181
<i>And your real mother, didn't she
teach you it's rude to point people?</i>

35:00.348 --> 35:04.018
<i>The only thing my mother taught
me was how to take a punch</i>

35:04.186 --> 35:05.603
<i>and to cook up base.</i>

35:05.770 --> 35:07.521
<i>She taught my sister to suck dick</i>

35:07.689 --> 35:10.232
<i>- and take it up the ass.
- My goodness.</i>

35:10.400 --> 35:13.819
<i>Hans,
show Mary Poppins the way out.</i>

35:17.741 --> 35:21.911
<i>It`s a shame you were`nt been closer to your mother,
she might have taught you manners.</i>

35:22.120 --> 35:26.498
<i>For instance, when a lady enters
the room, it is polite to stand up.</i>

35:37.510 --> 35:40.262
<i>Do you think you could
stand up for me now, Mr Ryder?</i>

35:40.430 --> 35:43.349
<i>Lady, I swear,
I don't know where she is,</i>

35:43.475 --> 35:45.601
<i>Cat or her fucking baby.</i>

35:45.769 --> 35:47.728
<i>You can sit down now.</i>

35:47.896 --> 35:49.897
<i>Ah! God!</i>

35:50.106 --> 35:51.523
<i>Are you crazy?</i>

35:51.691 --> 35:55.778
<i>God! OK, OK, OK.
I'll tell you all I know.</i>

35:55.987 --> 36:00.991
<i>Hmm, well, unfortunately, with
a man of your low character</i>

36:01.159 --> 36:03.035
<i>and I don't mean to insult you</i>

36:03.203 --> 36:07.748
<i>but you were brought up by a sodomy
and fellatio-tutoring crack addict</i>

36:07.916 --> 36:10.376
<i>there's always a possibility
that you might lie.</i>

36:11.836 --> 36:13.921
<i>Lady, you got to trust me.</i>

36:14.130 --> 36:15.506
<i>Well, that's one option.</i>

36:15.674 --> 36:17.508
<i>Oh, no, no, no, lady!</i>

36:29.562 --> 36:32.690
<i>Mr Carver? Officer Slobodan.</i>

36:32.857 --> 36:34.441
<i>We have two young males.</i>

36:35.527 --> 36:38.112
<i>OK. Pictures coming right up.</i>

36:38.279 --> 36:42.783
<i>- We are private investigators, We're gonna help find your daughter.
- Politsia? Hah! They find nothing.</i>

36:42.951 --> 36:45.536
<i>I agree with you wholeheartedly.</i>

36:45.662 --> 36:48.163
<i>That's why the world need
professionals like us.</i>

36:48.331 --> 36:51.542
<i>We handle, er, how many cases would you say
on the books, Anthony?</i>

36:51.668 --> 36:55.254
<i>- One.
- Too many to count, really.</i>

36:55.422 --> 36:58.257
<i>But we really feel that
we can find your daughter.</i>

36:58.425 --> 37:00.259
<i>- Find her?
- Yes.</i>

37:00.427 --> 37:04.054
<i>Who says Catalina disappear?
Like I already told woman.</i>

37:04.222 --> 37:05.597
<i>What woman?</i>

37:05.765 --> 37:09.601
<i>Woman policeman.
Name Virgin Woolf. Very nice.</i>

37:09.769 --> 37:13.063
<i>I say my daughter never home.
Takes after mother.</i>

37:13.231 --> 37:17.568
<i>All I have is broken condom
that turns into son here.</i>

37:17.736 --> 37:20.112
<i>Hey! Hey!</i>

37:20.280 --> 37:23.490
<i>So how much money
we talk about?</i>

37:23.616 --> 37:25.617
<i>Er, not very much money.</i>

37:25.785 --> 37:27.828
<i>Our fee is $400 a day
plus expenses.</i>

37:27.996 --> 37:30.706
<i>And we'd need a $2,000 retainer.</i>

37:30.874 --> 37:32.791
<i>How about 100 Euros?</i>

37:32.959 --> 37:34.376
<i>What, a day?</i>

37:34.544 --> 37:35.961
<i>No, the whole thing.</i>

37:36.171 --> 37:38.756
<i>Give me 100 Euros,
I can help you find sister.</i>

37:38.923 --> 37:41.008
<i>When she first started
fucking for money,</i>

37:41.217 --> 37:44.178
<i>I drive her a little bit
for, how you say, protection.</i>

37:44.345 --> 37:47.014
<i>I could show you where I took her.</i>

37:47.223 --> 37:50.225
<i>Her favourite client.
Maybe he knows where she is.</i>

37:50.393 --> 37:54.146
<i>Look, the way detective business works
is that you would actually pay us...</i>

37:54.314 --> 37:56.607
<i>- Here, take it.
- What are you doing?</i>

37:56.733 --> 37:59.443
<i>- You have a car?
- You just paid him though.</i>

37:59.611 --> 38:02.613
<i>We could have got the retainer.
What the hell are you doing, man?</i>

38:02.781 --> 38:06.575
<i>I think
Pinocchio needs his nose clipped.</i>

38:08.787 --> 38:10.871
<i>Oh, God!</i>

38:14.375 --> 38:19.797
<i>And this will teach this little piggy
not to point.</i>

38:24.886 --> 38:28.931
<i>That car is tailing us.
It been following us since the pig farm.</i>

38:29.140 --> 38:31.600
<i>They were snapping shots
of us with the long ones.</i>

38:31.726 --> 38:34.019
<i>Uh-oh. It could be the cops.</i>

38:34.229 --> 38:36.063
<i>Whoop whoop-whoop whoop.</i>

38:36.272 --> 38:39.483
<i>- Do you want me to lose them?
- Yes, I do want to lose them.</i>

38:39.651 --> 38:41.985
<i>OK, why are we going off the road?</i>

38:42.195 --> 38:44.196
<i>- Tree!
- Left, left, left!</i>

38:44.364 --> 38:46.573
<i>I think I peed a little bit.</i>

38:56.042 --> 38:58.043
<i>Shit.</i>

38:58.253 --> 39:00.420
<i>- Oh, damn, you all right?
- Yeah. You?</i>

39:00.588 --> 39:02.005
<i>Yeah.</i>

39:02.215 --> 39:04.049
<i>Yo, where's your boy at?</i>

39:09.597 --> 39:11.932
<i>- Oh, man, he look dead.
- You OK?</i>

39:13.768 --> 39:16.603
<i>Come on, man.</i>

39:16.729 --> 39:18.438
<i>Shoulda wore that belt.</i>

39:18.606 --> 39:21.441
<i>Come on, man. You all right?</i>

39:21.609 --> 39:23.944
<i>You need to get a doctor.
Just give me the address we'll take a taxi.</i>

39:29.033 --> 39:30.492
<i>Hello?</i>

39:30.660 --> 39:33.453
<i>The fish that got away.
Has it been fried yet?</i>

39:33.621 --> 39:35.414
<i>Er, don't worry.</i>

39:35.582 --> 39:37.249
<i>We've got the borders sealed.</i>

39:37.417 --> 39:40.502
<i>She'll hardly go to the police,
though we have friends there.</i>

39:40.670 --> 39:42.713
<i>I'm not worried about your fucking police.</i>

39:42.839 --> 39:47.509
<i>In your country you may be able to get away with
burying 5,000 people in a mass grave and call it a day</i>

39:47.677 --> 39:52.264
<i>but in America, even a hint of scandal
and the Senate will be up my ass.</i>

39:52.432 --> 39:55.434
<i>If I see that girl on TV in anything
other than a body bag,</i>

39:55.602 --> 39:57.895
<i>the closest you'll get
to a missile contract</i>

39:58.062 --> 40:00.272
<i>is reading about them
in the fucking newspaper.</i>

40:00.440 --> 40:03.692
<i>- Jesus, Bill, it wasn't me who...
- Don't you Jesus fucking Bill me.</i>

40:03.818 --> 40:07.279
<i>- Just find the girl.
- It's being done. Trust me.</i>

40:07.447 --> 40:09.740
<i>Carver's got his best man on it.</i>

40:09.908 --> 40:12.743
<i>Well, I believe you now, Mr Ryder.</i>

40:12.911 --> 40:16.538
<i>You really don't have
any additional information for me.</i>

40:16.706 --> 40:18.916
<i>I apologise for
taking up your morning,</i>

40:19.083 --> 40:22.044
<i>but I'm sure you appreciate
the value of being thorough.</i>

40:22.337 --> 40:24.588
<i>A job worth doing
is worth doing well,</i>

40:24.756 --> 40:26.673
<i>as my dear old mum used to say.</i>

40:27.842 --> 40:29.801
<i>Kill me.</i>

40:29.969 --> 40:33.055
<i>Ooh, now.
What's the magic word?</i>

40:35.558 --> 40:37.726
<i>Please. Kill me.</i>

40:37.852 --> 40:40.395
<i>- Fucking bitch.
- That's the one.</i>

40:41.397 --> 40:44.483
<i>Well, I'll say goodbye to you, sir.</i>

40:45.443 --> 40:48.278
<i>Now, do you need a moment?</i>

40:50.573 --> 40:53.492
<i>Anthony Hester and Julian Simms,
American nationals.</i>

40:53.660 --> 40:58.455
<i>When Cat called you, that was from
Julian's cell and Anthony's car.</i>

40:58.623 --> 41:02.209
<i>- Why they are talking to the family?
- They're private detectives.</i>

41:02.418 --> 41:04.461
<i>- Working for who?
- We don't know.</i>

41:04.629 --> 41:07.422
<i>But Julian gave 100 Euros
to the brother.</i>

41:07.590 --> 41:09.800
<i>- Is that a problem for us?
- Maybe.</i>

41:09.926 --> 41:11.677
<i>Want me to ring the bank?</i>

41:11.803 --> 41:14.429
<i>No, no,
we'll deal with it ourselves.</i>

41:17.558 --> 41:19.434
<i>Bonjour, comment ca va?</i>

41:19.602 --> 41:21.895
<i>Bonjour, mademoiselles.</i>

41:22.063 --> 41:24.022
<i>Er, ou east...</i>

41:24.190 --> 41:26.358
<i>Rue de Bon? Rue de Bun?</i>

41:26.526 --> 41:31.029
<i>We're looking for Rudible. Ladies,
you wanna help us out? S'il vous plait?</i>

41:31.197 --> 41:32.781
<i>You saw the high scarf?</i>

41:32.907 --> 41:34.700
<i>Those weren't words you said to those girls.</i>

41:34.826 --> 41:38.495
<i>You wanna deal with girls or you
wanna start a detective agency?</i>

41:38.663 --> 41:40.080
<i>I wanna do both.</i>

41:40.248 --> 41:43.000
<i>You need to focus
on finding Catalina, I think</i>

41:43.167 --> 41:46.545
<i>Oh! Anthony
and Catalina sitting in a tree...</i>

41:46.713 --> 41:51.133
<i>There is no-one like her
to draw venom from my serpent.</i>

41:58.016 --> 42:00.225
<i>More sweetly than any other one.</i>

42:00.435 --> 42:02.853
<i>So, you're saying,
as a blowjob provider,</i>

42:03.021 --> 42:05.772
<i>Cat's head and shoulders
above the rest?</i>

42:05.898 --> 42:07.607
<i>"A blowjob provider"?</i>

42:07.775 --> 42:12.863
<i>That would be like calling
Caravaggio a house painter.</i>

42:13.031 --> 42:16.825
<i>Gentlemen, would you like
some tea? Chamomile.</i>

42:16.993 --> 42:18.577
<i>Sure, I'll have a cup.</i>

42:18.745 --> 42:20.912
<i>You are not to be
easily shocked, are you?</i>

42:21.080 --> 42:22.914
<i>- No, no.
- Us? No, go on.</i>

42:23.082 --> 42:26.251
<i>Cat produced from me
a jet of semen,</i>

42:26.461 --> 42:27.961
<i>which travelled some 11 feet.</i>

42:28.129 --> 42:32.466
<i>It was like the salty exhale
of the great white whale</i>

42:32.633 --> 42:34.217
<i>in Melville's classic tome.</i>

42:34.427 --> 42:36.762
<i>Let me show you something.</i>

42:36.888 --> 42:39.639
<i>This is a mark here she leaves.</i>

42:42.393 --> 42:44.227
<i>"Le plaisir de Cat".</i>

42:44.437 --> 42:47.689
<i>Wow. From the windows
to the walls. That's nice shooting.</i>

42:47.857 --> 42:49.232
<i>indeed.</i>

42:49.442 --> 42:52.152
<i>Let me ask you something,
gentlemen.</i>

42:52.362 --> 42:57.949
<i>If I help you find her, will there
be any, er, pecuniary rewards?</i>

42:58.117 --> 43:01.078
<i>I don't want to sound
too bourgeois,</i>

43:01.245 --> 43:04.206
<i>but my needs
are quite varied and exotic.</i>

43:04.415 --> 43:08.085
<i>Well, the reward will be
very large and pecuniary,</i>

43:08.252 --> 43:11.755
<i>and, er, Catalina's father's
filthy rich, he's rolling in it.</i>

43:11.881 --> 43:16.093
<i>Very well. I obtained her services
through a man named Ryder.</i>

43:16.260 --> 43:17.761
<i>Do you have a number?</i>

43:17.887 --> 43:20.680
<i>Better yet, gentlemen.
His address.</i>

43:29.273 --> 43:31.608
<i>- Hi.
- Hi.</i>

43:31.776 --> 43:34.945
<i>OK. It's a level-five encryption.</i>

43:35.113 --> 43:36.655
<i>- Level-five?
- Uh-huh.</i>

43:36.823 --> 43:38.407
<i>Wow, that might be a problem.</i>

43:38.574 --> 43:41.993
<i>If anyone can do it, you can.
You are my little genius.</i>

43:42.161 --> 43:45.122
<i>Thank you. After all these years,
you haven't changed.</i>

43:45.289 --> 43:48.291
<i>I'll bring the hard drive
and passport to the hotel</i>

43:48.501 --> 43:50.544
<i>as soon as it's ready.</i>

43:50.711 --> 43:53.004
<i>You sure you got the right place?</i>

43:53.172 --> 43:54.965
<i>It's the address he wrote down.</i>

43:55.133 --> 43:58.176
<i>- I didn't sign up for this.
- It's a little sketchy.</i>

43:58.344 --> 43:59.928
<i>Can we go back?</i>

44:00.096 --> 44:02.305
<i>Come on, we're right here.
You ready?</i>

44:02.515 --> 44:03.932
<i>No.</i>

44:07.603 --> 44:10.939
<i>What kind of pimp doesn't open
up for a potential doubleheader?</i>

44:11.065 --> 44:13.150
<i>A dead pimp.</i>

44:29.125 --> 44:30.667
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

44:30.835 --> 44:32.169
<i>How bad is it?</i>

44:32.336 --> 44:36.131
<i>Remember when you started that
lawn mower with the black kittens inside?</i>

44:36.299 --> 44:38.717
<i>- Yeah.
- This is much worse.</i>

44:38.885 --> 44:41.094
<i>Oh, damn!</i>

44:41.262 --> 44:43.805
<i>You weren't kidding
about the dead part.</i>

44:43.973 --> 44:46.600
<i>Ah-Ah! What the hell?</i>

44:46.767 --> 44:48.143
<i>Are those...? Ahhhh!</i>

44:48.311 --> 44:50.604
<i>Chick who did this
must have been pissed.</i>

44:50.771 --> 44:52.564
<i>What, a female did this?</i>

44:52.732 --> 44:55.525
<i>- I think so.
- Wanna see what she looks like?</i>

44:55.693 --> 44:57.402
<i>- That blinking light.
- Shit!</i>

44:57.612 --> 45:01.281
<i>Security cam. I'm thinking
it recorded everything just went down.</i>

45:01.491 --> 45:05.076
<i>Our sick, castrating bitch missed
it cos it was bright outside.</i>

45:05.244 --> 45:07.579
<i>Course, I could be wrong,
but I don't think so.</i>

45:16.714 --> 45:20.509
<i>Look at this lady plying her trade.</i>

45:20.676 --> 45:23.512
<i>Oh, she's plying
more than a trade.</i>

45:23.679 --> 45:27.599
<i>Ohhh, God! Ohhhh!</i>

45:27.767 --> 45:30.310
<i>Oh, my God. Is she going for the...</i>

45:30.520 --> 45:33.230
<i>Not the nuts, not the n-n-n... No!</i>

45:35.983 --> 45:38.610
<i>..on a houseboat
on the river in ltaly...</i>

45:38.778 --> 45:40.987
<i>- What? ltaly?
- .. near Ferrara.</i>

45:41.113 --> 45:45.242
<i>The arsehole sold her out!
He sold the baby down the river and the houseboat!</i>

45:45.409 --> 45:48.370
<i>- We should probably warn her.
- Let me see this.</i>

45:48.579 --> 45:50.789
<i>Er, Grushenka,
Grushenka, Grushenka...</i>

45:50.957 --> 45:54.459
<i>- No Grushenkas here.
- Look for, er, Agrafena.</i>

45:54.669 --> 45:57.712
<i>- Agrafena?
- Grushenka's short for Agrafena.</i>

45:57.880 --> 45:59.214
<i>Grushenka's longer.</i>

45:59.382 --> 46:02.551
<i>It's three syllab...
Just look for the fucking number.</i>

46:02.718 --> 46:04.678
<i>It's like the backwards Ks and Hs.</i>

46:04.845 --> 46:09.891
<i>- Read The Brothers Karamazov.
- You just read the Cliff Notes.</i>

46:10.059 --> 46:11.393
<i>I read it. Look up the number.</i>

46:11.602 --> 46:15.063
<i>Well, I'll be damned!
OK, here, you talk to her.</i>

46:15.231 --> 46:18.149
<i>- Why don't you talk to her?
- No, dude, I'm nervous.</i>

46:18.317 --> 46:19.734
<i>My stomach's bubbling.</i>

46:19.902 --> 46:22.362
<i>- I get sweaty armpits.
- Shut the fuck up.</i>

46:33.583 --> 46:36.918
<i>Grushenka, listen.
Someone is coming to kill you.</i>

46:37.086 --> 46:38.962
<i>A very bad lady
is coming to kill you.</i>

46:40.673 --> 46:43.758
<i>You need to get out right now. Someone is coming
to kill you and the baby.</i>

46:45.970 --> 46:47.470
<i>She's speaking Russian.</i>

46:47.680 --> 46:49.389
<i>What? Russian? Oh, let me see.</i>

46:49.598 --> 46:51.016
<i>You speak Russian?</i>

46:51.142 --> 46:53.101
<i>I had a Russian girlfriend once.</i>

46:57.356 --> 47:00.734
<i>Bitch!
Get the fuck out of here!</i>

47:00.901 --> 47:05.071
<i>I'll kill you!
I'll kill you!</i>

47:05.197 --> 47:08.616
<i>I'll kill you!
Get the fuck out of here!</i>

47:08.784 --> 47:12.370
<i>- Are you threatening me?
- I'll kill you!</i>

47:15.333 --> 47:18.418
<i>- You think she understood that?
- Do you think I did?</i>

47:18.627 --> 47:21.338
<i>I think we need to
go warn her in person.</i>

47:44.028 --> 47:46.237
<i>I like you very much, young lady.</i>

47:46.405 --> 47:50.158
<i>Your resilience, and dedication
to your friend is admirable.</i>

47:50.326 --> 47:51.868
<i>Oh-oh-oh.</i>

47:52.036 --> 47:53.745
<i>There we are.</i>

47:53.913 --> 47:58.917
<i>You must understand,
I will find Catalina anyway,</i>

47:59.085 --> 48:01.461
<i>and then your sacrifice
and your nobility</i>

48:01.670 --> 48:03.088
<i>will all have been in vain.</i>

48:04.799 --> 48:07.759
<i>Oh dear, oh dear.</i>

48:10.971 --> 48:12.514
<i>Do you see these?</i>

48:12.723 --> 48:15.809
<i>These are to remind me
of courage.</i>

48:15.976 --> 48:18.812
<i>I had them made from the teeth
of a young man</i>

48:18.979 --> 48:20.647
<i>I interrogated in the Yemen.</i>

48:20.815 --> 48:24.484
<i>He held out
for eight days straight.</i>

48:24.693 --> 48:27.862
<i>The last thing he said to me
before he died,</i>

48:28.030 --> 48:32.534
<i>having told us absolutely nothing,
by the way, was the F word.</i>

48:34.328 --> 48:37.831
<i>Ahh, look who's just woken up.</i>

48:37.998 --> 48:39.749
<i>Hello.</i>

48:39.917 --> 48:46.339
<i>- Please...
- Hello! hello, relax.</i>

48:48.509 --> 48:50.927
<i>Please leave the baby out of this.</i>

48:51.095 --> 48:52.429
<i>Leave him alone.</i>

48:54.306 --> 48:58.101
<i>Hola.
How are you, little one?</i>

48:58.227 --> 49:03.857
<i>Leave him alone!
Please let Alex be.</i>

49:04.024 --> 49:08.361
<i>Oh, you like this toy, do you?</i>

49:08.529 --> 49:12.699
<i>Where is Cat, Grushenka?</i>

49:12.867 --> 49:16.035
<i>Anthony I know I came over with this detective idea
but I'm ready to wait tables.</i>

49:16.203 --> 49:19.330
<i>- No, no, no, We got to save this girl.
- You think she's still alive?</i>

49:19.498 --> 49:22.000
<i>I don't know. I hope so.</i>

49:22.168 --> 49:25.503
<i>This is morphine.
It will make your death painless.</i>

49:28.466 --> 49:30.633
<i>I really don't know where she is.</i>

49:30.843 --> 49:32.969
<i>Shh.</i>

49:33.137 --> 49:37.640
<i>- I believe you.
- Please, the baby.</i>

49:37.850 --> 49:43.771
<i>Yes, yes, I'll call the police.
They'll take care of him.</i>

49:46.567 --> 49:52.405
<i>I want you to know
I would never hurt a tiny baby.</i>

49:58.913 --> 50:00.955
<i>Not on a Sunday.</i>

50:07.296 --> 50:10.173
<i>Hey! Hey!</i>

50:10.299 --> 50:13.676
<i>Don't you know how to drive?
I'm wet, bitch!</i>

50:16.680 --> 50:18.806
<i>- Hello?
- Hello, this is Virgin Woolf?</i>

50:18.974 --> 50:20.391
<i>This is Virginia Woolf.</i>

50:20.559 --> 50:22.644
<i>This is Catalina's father.
You remember me?</i>

50:22.853 --> 50:25.271
<i>Good morning, Mr Rona.
How may I help you?</i>

50:26.941 --> 50:31.319
<i>Hello?</i>

50:33.531 --> 50:35.198
<i>Oh, God.</i>

50:35.324 --> 50:37.617
<i>Ma'am, are you OK?</i>

50:37.826 --> 50:39.577
<i>Say something.</i>

50:39.787 --> 50:41.621
<i>- Come on, I got you.
- Miss. Hello?</i>

50:45.584 --> 50:48.002
<i>Splen... Splendid?</i>

50:48.170 --> 50:51.464
<i>Oh, God.</i>

50:53.968 --> 50:56.344
<i>- What's going on?
- I think she's dead.</i>

50:56.512 --> 50:58.638
<i>She said something like
"splendid" before...</i>

50:58.847 --> 51:01.641
<i>Jesus. Oh, no.</i>

51:01.850 --> 51:04.435
<i>I think she meant
the Splendid Hotel in Budva.</i>

51:04.603 --> 51:06.104
<i>That's probably where Cat is right now.</i>

51:06.272 --> 51:11.484
<i>Dex, I need you to get us tickets to Constalova.
We'll be staying at the Splendid Hotel.</i>

51:11.652 --> 51:13.611
<i>And tell him send some thermal underwear.</i>

51:13.821 --> 51:15.405
<i>So you will buy me a new van?</i>

51:15.573 --> 51:19.242
<i>- It would be my pleasure.
- With AC, CD, DVD, and TV?</i>

51:19.368 --> 51:23.705
<i>Fully equipped. What information
do you have for me?</i>

51:23.914 --> 51:26.541
<i>Two guys came, wanted to know
about my daughter.</i>

51:26.709 --> 51:28.668
<i>Asking many questions.</i>

51:30.170 --> 51:33.047
<i>Here. They gave card.</i>

51:33.215 --> 51:34.757
<i>So, you pay me now?</i>

51:34.967 --> 51:36.759
<i>Oh, yes, I'll pay you now.</i>

51:36.969 --> 51:38.553
<i>Do you need a moment?</i>

51:38.721 --> 51:40.221
<i>For what?</i>

51:44.393 --> 51:46.394
<i>No, Ronas, no stay here.</i>

51:46.562 --> 51:50.690
<i>No Ronas? OK, see if
you have a Cat or a Catalina.</i>

51:50.899 --> 51:54.235
<i>Sir, we have 370 rooms
and over thousand guests.</i>

51:54.361 --> 51:57.363
<i>OK, she's a short girl, 5'4", 5'5",</i>

51:57.531 --> 52:00.283
<i>long, dark hair,
nice low-opening booty.</i>

52:00.409 --> 52:03.036
<i>Got up-top heavy breasts,
skimpy dress.</i>

52:03.203 --> 52:04.537
<i>No, I'm sorry.</i>

52:04.705 --> 52:06.372
<i>All right, well, let me get a room.</i>

52:06.498 --> 52:08.374
<i>It is magic convention today.</i>

52:08.500 --> 52:11.628
<i>I am afraid we have only
Presidential Suite apartment.</i>

52:11.795 --> 52:14.922
<i>But it's much too expensive.
It's 2,400 Euros.</i>

52:15.090 --> 52:16.633
<i>- 2,400 Euros?
- Yes.</i>

52:16.800 --> 52:19.302
<i>OK. You, er,
you come with the room?</i>

52:19.428 --> 52:20.803
<i>No, I'm sorry.</i>

52:21.013 --> 52:23.139
<i>- You don't come with the room?
- No.</i>

52:28.896 --> 52:30.521
<i>Hello?</i>

52:30.689 --> 52:33.024
<i>- Can I help you?
- Hello.</i>

52:33.192 --> 52:35.985
<i>Is this the Juan Detective Agency?</i>

52:36.153 --> 52:39.656
<i>- It's Ju-An. Come on in.
- Thank you.</i>

52:39.823 --> 52:41.240
<i>Can I get you anything?</i>

52:41.408 --> 52:44.577
<i>We have a lovely selection
of herbal teas.</i>

52:44.745 --> 52:47.830
<i>Or are you just looking for
a good date?</i>

52:48.040 --> 52:51.250
<i>How very kind.
Nothing for me, thank you.</i>

52:51.418 --> 52:53.628
<i>My name's Emily Bronte.</i>

52:53.796 --> 52:56.214
<i>I'm from
the National Security Agency.</i>

52:56.382 --> 53:00.051
<i>I believe you're working on a case
of great importance to us.</i>

53:00.219 --> 53:03.137
<i>A missing girl. Catalina Rona.</i>

53:05.724 --> 53:07.475
<i>Emily Bronte?</i>

53:07.643 --> 53:09.977
<i>Like the writer lady?</i>

53:10.145 --> 53:12.563
<i>Died of, er, TB or some shit?</i>

53:12.731 --> 53:14.982
<i>Well, yes, as a matter of fact.</i>

53:15.150 --> 53:18.778
<i>Well, Miss Bronte,
I can't discuss the case with you.</i>

53:18.987 --> 53:21.155
<i>You'll have to
talk to my employers.</i>

53:21.323 --> 53:23.116
<i>When might I be able to do that?</i>

53:23.283 --> 53:26.285
<i>Well, they're in the field,
so it might be a few days.</i>

53:27.746 --> 53:30.331
<i>And what field might that be?</i>

53:30.457 --> 53:32.500
<i>Why don't you
give me your number,</i>

53:32.668 --> 53:34.961
<i>and I'll be happy to pass it on?</i>

53:35.129 --> 53:37.046
<i>Or you could just
give me that little note</i>

53:37.214 --> 53:40.091
<i>that you slipped into
the Gospel of St John.</i>

53:40.259 --> 53:41.592
<i>You...</i>

53:41.760 --> 53:45.054
<i>You, er,
you read that upside down.</i>

53:45.222 --> 53:47.515
<i>I did.</i>

53:47.683 --> 53:49.475
<i>You did.</i>

54:41.737 --> 54:43.571
<i>Oh, Lord.</i>

54:45.324 --> 54:47.575
<i>Oh, damn.</i>

54:55.542 --> 54:58.127
<i>Oh, my goodness.</i>

55:03.842 --> 55:06.385
<i>Oh, put them away.</i>

55:08.180 --> 55:10.223
<i>Sweet baby Jesus.</i>

55:15.938 --> 55:17.647
<i>Nice. Oh!</i>

55:17.815 --> 55:21.108
<i>Oh, king size!
I got this. I got all this.</i>

55:21.276 --> 55:24.111
<i>You make your phone calls.
I'm going to put him to bed.</i>

55:24.279 --> 55:27.240
<i>OK, we just need to
find your mom, that's all.</i>

55:28.116 --> 55:29.867
<i>Shh, it`s ok, it's all right.</i>

55:32.830 --> 55:37.333
<i>Hi, my name is Julian.
I'm looking for Cat or Catalina.</i>

55:37.501 --> 55:39.627
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

55:39.795 --> 55:41.337
<i>OK, all right.</i>

55:41.505 --> 55:44.507
<i>Let's take a little look at
what you got here, OK?</i>

55:48.387 --> 55:50.763
<i>Hey! Can you shut the baby up? Please!</i>

55:50.931 --> 55:54.475
<i>Hello? Hi? I'm looking for
a Cat or Catalina.</i>

55:54.601 --> 55:57.353
<i>- No, no, housekeeping .
- Oh, I'm sorry, OK.</i>

55:57.521 --> 55:59.730
<i>Well, yeah, can we get
more towels up here, then?</i>

55:59.898 --> 56:01.524
<i>Yes, yes, moment.</i>

56:22.170 --> 56:23.629
<i>One new message.</i>

56:23.797 --> 56:25.882
<i>Er, hi, my name's Julian Simms...</i>

56:36.977 --> 56:38.769
<i>There she is. Is that her?</i>

56:38.937 --> 56:41.355
<i>I recognise that rack.</i>

56:41.523 --> 56:43.441
<i>How do I look?</i>

56:43.609 --> 56:46.819
<i>You're good, let me see.
Collar's cool.</i>

56:46.987 --> 56:49.614
<i>What about the 'fro? 'Fro's good?</i>

56:50.699 --> 56:52.617
<i>The boats. See her boats?</i>

56:52.743 --> 56:54.243
<i>Get her number this time.</i>

56:55.913 --> 56:57.914
<i>Come on. Give him to me.
Give me my baby.</i>

56:58.081 --> 57:00.750
<i>- It's OK.
- Give him to me. Come on.</i>

57:08.842 --> 57:10.801
<i>Sit down.</i>

57:10.969 --> 57:13.554
<i>I have a gun in my bag.</i>

57:13.680 --> 57:17.016
<i>You try anything, I swear to God,
I will shoot you in the balls.</i>

57:17.225 --> 57:18.893
<i>It's OK. It's not necessary.</i>

57:19.061 --> 57:22.104
<i>Not to mention impossible,
since you don't really have a gun.</i>

57:22.314 --> 57:24.857
<i>Man, you could be wrong.</i>

57:25.025 --> 57:27.234
<i>Who are you guys, hm?</i>

57:27.402 --> 57:29.487
<i>You don't recognise us?</i>

57:29.655 --> 57:31.447
<i>- I stole your car.
- And my phone.</i>

57:31.615 --> 57:34.784
<i>With my ringtones, numbers,
I had those pictures.</i>

57:34.952 --> 57:36.452
<i>What do you want?</i>

57:46.088 --> 57:49.423
<i>- What the fuck, man?
- I know you did not just slap me.</i>

57:49.591 --> 57:53.094
<i>Listen to me. We're private investigators.
Your father hired us to find you.</i>

57:53.303 --> 57:56.013
<i>- My father?
- I mean, technically, we're not...</i>

57:56.223 --> 57:57.890
<i>Ah, OK, he's worried about you.</i>

57:58.058 --> 58:02.103
<i>The only thing that piece of shit is worried about is the money
I stopped sending after my Mom died.</i>

58:02.312 --> 58:03.938
<i>You all don't get along?</i>

58:04.106 --> 58:06.023
<i>You could say that.</i>

58:06.233 --> 58:09.318
<i>Yes! My father and I
were the same way.</i>

58:09.486 --> 58:12.405
<i>I mean. He preferred my brother,
He would take him fishing and stuff.</i>

58:12.572 --> 58:14.240
<i>My father used to beat me with a belt</i>

58:14.408 --> 58:16.701
<i>and made me sleep in the barn
with pigs.</i>

58:16.827 --> 58:18.953
<i>Yes, yours is substantially worse.</i>

58:19.121 --> 58:21.539
<i>- That's worse. Yeah.
- Why have you got my son?</i>

58:21.707 --> 58:24.583
<i>- Agrafena is dead.
- Who is Agrafena?</i>

58:24.751 --> 58:29.130
<i>- Grushenka's short for Agrafena. How`s that..
- Nobody been reading that book.</i>

58:29.339 --> 58:32.341
<i>- You got to get them Cliff Notes.
- Grushenka's dead?</i>

58:32.509 --> 58:33.843
<i>Yeah. And your friend Ryder too.</i>

58:34.011 --> 58:35.886
<i>Dead. Gone, six feet under.</i>

58:36.054 --> 58:37.930
<i>- He's my pimp.
- No, not any more.</i>

58:38.098 --> 58:41.517
<i>He's pimped out. We think the same person that
did this came to our office. They tried to kill our assistant,</i>

58:41.685 --> 58:43.060
<i>cut his fucking arm off.</i>

58:43.270 --> 58:46.731
<i>What kind of person really does cuts
a one-armed man's only arm off?</i>

58:46.857 --> 58:50.026
<i>Cat, listen to me it's the kind of person
that`s gonna cuts someone's balls off.</i>

58:50.193 --> 58:52.945
<i>- They are going to find you.
- Find you.</i>

58:53.113 --> 58:56.949
<i>They gonna chop you up like a tomato.
We need to get you out of here fast.</i>

58:57.117 --> 59:02.371
<i>No, I can't run. I'm waiting for someone.
My room is 432. Meet me there.</i>

59:02.539 --> 59:05.541
<i>Wait. No, I'm gonna go with you.
Get the check, OK?</i>

59:05.709 --> 59:07.543
<i>How you gonna tell me
to get the check?</i>

59:07.711 --> 59:11.756
<i>You want me to get the check?
I don't... I didn't order these nuts.</i>

59:48.835 --> 59:51.003
<i>Coming out?</i>

59:51.171 --> 59:53.130
<i>Going down?</i>

59:53.340 --> 59:55.091
<i>Yes, please.</i>

59:57.094 --> 59:59.220
<i>- Um, what floor?
- Oh, that'll do fine.</i>

59:59.429 --> 01:00:01.722
<i>Er, OK.</i>

01:00:11.566 --> 01:00:13.901
<i>- After you.
- Thank you.</i>

01:00:43.014 --> 01:00:44.682
<i>Help. She's trying to kill me.</i>

01:00:44.850 --> 01:00:47.560
<i>Look, she's a psychotic killer.
I`m telling you. Look how tall she is!</i>

01:00:49.980 --> 01:00:51.981
<i>Where's your friend gone
with Catalina?</i>

01:00:52.149 --> 01:00:54.608
<i>Damn.</i>

01:00:58.697 --> 01:01:00.781
<i>- Who is it?
- It's me.</i>

01:01:00.907 --> 01:01:03.742
<i>Come along now, we haven't
got all day. Chop chop.</i>

01:01:03.910 --> 01:01:05.953
<i>What did you do?
How did you bring her here?</i>

01:01:06.121 --> 01:01:08.414
<i>I didn't bring her here.
She's got a gun.</i>

01:01:09.666 --> 01:01:11.584
<i>Please. Please!</i>

01:01:18.466 --> 01:01:20.634
<i>Alone at last.</i>

01:01:20.802 --> 01:01:24.305
<i>Now, would you mind
closing those curtains?</i>

01:01:28.560 --> 01:01:30.853
<i>You have a delectable accent.
Where are you from?</i>

01:01:30.979 --> 01:01:34.148
<i>- I'm gonna try something.
- I'm from Canada.</i>

01:01:34.316 --> 01:01:38.694
<i>I take back all the bad things
I've ever said about Canadians in my entire life.</i>

01:01:39.446 --> 01:01:42.364
<i>Now, how are you two involved?</i>

01:01:42.574 --> 01:01:44.783
<i>We're private detectives.</i>

01:01:50.790 --> 01:01:52.666
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

01:01:52.834 --> 01:01:56.337
<i>Why does everybody have that reaction?</i>

01:01:56.546 --> 01:01:59.590
<i>- Who is it?
- lvan for Cat.</i>

01:02:04.304 --> 01:02:06.764
<i>I'm here for Cat. Is she here?</i>

01:02:09.893 --> 01:02:11.810
<i>Do come in.</i>

01:02:15.982 --> 01:02:20.402
<i>Hey, guys, Siegfried is looking for
a new Roy in room 432.</i>

01:02:20.612 --> 01:02:22.363
<i>Wow!</i>

01:02:24.241 --> 01:02:25.950
<i>Aha. Lovely.</i>

01:02:26.076 --> 01:02:29.370
<i>Now, we're almost done.</i>

01:02:30.705 --> 01:02:34.250
<i>- Ladies first.
- Please, I have a child.</i>

01:02:34.417 --> 01:02:35.876
<i>Oh, my dear Catalina.</i>

01:02:36.002 --> 01:02:40.798
<i>If I had a shilling for every time
someone said that to me, I wouldn't be standing here.</i>

01:02:40.966 --> 01:02:42.883
<i>But someone else would.</i>

01:02:43.009 --> 01:02:44.510
<i>Now,</i>

01:02:44.678 --> 01:02:46.095
<i>do you need a moment?</i>

01:02:47.722 --> 01:02:49.640
<i>Wait! My partner and I have a DVD</i>

01:02:49.808 --> 01:02:52.309
<i>of you performing intimate surgery,
a cockectomy,</i>

01:02:52.519 --> 01:02:54.937
<i>on a dirty pimp,
which you don’t have medical licence for.</i>

01:02:55.063 --> 01:02:57.398
<i>You could be in a lot of trouble.</i>

01:02:59.150 --> 01:03:00.651
<i>I'm getting old.</i>

01:03:00.819 --> 01:03:03.612
<i>Don't beat yourself up.
It was bright outside.</i>

01:03:03.780 --> 01:03:06.407
<i>- You couldn't see the light blink.
- Where's the tape?</i>

01:03:06.616 --> 01:03:11.078
<i>Oh, OK. A question.
See? We're starting to negotiate.</i>

01:03:11.246 --> 01:03:13.914
<i>I only need one of you
to tell me where the tape is.</i>

01:03:16.251 --> 01:03:18.836
<i>I'm beginning to lose my patience.</i>

01:03:23.550 --> 01:03:26.760
<i>I'm looking for Siegfried.
You must be his assistant.</i>

01:03:29.347 --> 01:03:31.390
<i>Look.</i>

01:03:34.352 --> 01:03:36.103
<i>Could you excuse me?</i>

01:03:43.903 --> 01:03:45.404
<i>Hurry! Come on!</i>

01:03:55.373 --> 01:03:57.166
<i>Lady, get down!</i>

01:04:02.839 --> 01:04:04.923
<i>in. in. in.</i>

01:04:14.517 --> 01:04:18.145
<i>What are you doing?
No, you're not. Dude.</i>

01:04:24.361 --> 01:04:26.737
<i>OK. OK, this is crazy.</i>

01:04:26.905 --> 01:04:28.697
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

01:04:33.953 --> 01:04:36.121
<i>OK, give me the baby.</i>

01:04:38.917 --> 01:04:40.292
<i>Oh!</i>

01:04:41.878 --> 01:04:44.838
<i>Give me a second.
You don't want to see me naked.</i>

01:04:47.092 --> 01:04:49.635
<i>What are you doing? Hurry up!</i>

01:04:56.351 --> 01:04:58.060
<i>Oh, God. Shit!</i>

01:05:00.188 --> 01:05:04.358
<i>Man! Help!</i>

01:05:04.526 --> 01:05:05.943
<i>Out the way!</i>

01:05:13.952 --> 01:05:15.994
<i>Hey, where are you going?</i>

01:05:27.215 --> 01:05:28.924
<i>Oh, good work, Helen.</i>

01:05:29.092 --> 01:05:31.718
<i>The money will be
in your account tomorrow.</i>

01:05:31.886 --> 01:05:34.263
<i>We had a little collateral
along the way.</i>

01:05:34.431 --> 01:05:36.432
<i>That's in the "shit happens" column.</i>

01:05:38.476 --> 01:05:40.185
<i>Who's a good boy?</i>

01:05:40.353 --> 01:05:43.147
<i>Mm. So, Daniel, tell me.</i>

01:05:43.273 --> 01:05:45.566
<i>You didn't know that
those two pubescent</i>

01:05:45.775 --> 01:05:50.154
<i>- were playing detective, did you?
- No, not until you told me.</i>

01:05:50.280 --> 01:05:52.114
<i>There's no-one else on the job?</i>

01:05:52.240 --> 01:05:53.615
<i>Of course not.</i>

01:05:53.825 --> 01:05:56.201
<i>I know you like to work alone.</i>

01:05:56.327 --> 01:05:57.911
<i>More than anything.</i>

01:05:58.079 --> 01:06:03.417
<i>Mr Jakovic wanted me to extend
an invite to his fundraising party.</i>

01:06:03.585 --> 01:06:07.546
<i>For the American
Secretary of Defence.</i>

01:06:07.755 --> 01:06:10.424
<i>Ooh, a posh do. How delicious.</i>

01:06:10.592 --> 01:06:13.427
<i>You know how I like to dress up.</i>

01:06:14.846 --> 01:06:19.057
<i>Helen, have you ever regretted
that you and I...?</i>

01:06:19.225 --> 01:06:21.435
<i>It's for the best, Daniel.</i>

01:06:21.603 --> 01:06:23.604
<i>We'll always have Angola.</i>

01:06:41.664 --> 01:06:44.666
<i>We're bringing someone else here.
Helen's done with this.</i>

01:06:45.460 --> 01:06:47.252
<i>Yeah. We have full containment.</i>

01:06:47.420 --> 01:06:49.421
<i>OK.</i>

01:06:49.589 --> 01:06:51.590
<i>Such a brave little girl.</i>

01:06:51.799 --> 01:06:55.093
<i>Are you having fun today
with your daddy?</i>

01:07:08.525 --> 01:07:09.942
<i>Helen was a good soldier.</i>

01:07:10.109 --> 01:07:12.569
<i>The best. An army of one.</i>

01:07:12.779 --> 01:07:15.489
<i>Do you think she took a peek
at the hard drive?</i>

01:07:15.657 --> 01:07:17.282
<i>Probably not.</i>

01:07:17.450 --> 01:07:19.660
<i>But I couldn't take that risk.</i>

01:07:21.287 --> 01:07:22.871
<i>It's all right, Bob.</i>

01:07:23.039 --> 01:07:24.998
<i>Old soldiers never die.</i>

01:07:25.166 --> 01:07:27.501
<i>They just get blown away.</i>

01:07:42.600 --> 01:07:46.311
<i>Hello, Bob.
Tell her you'll call her back.</i>

01:07:49.148 --> 01:07:50.816
<i>Do get in.</i>

01:07:59.534 --> 01:08:01.493
<i>A nod to the wise, my dear.</i>

01:08:01.661 --> 01:08:04.830
<i>You only need a little dab of
Aqua di Parma behind each ear.</i>

01:08:04.998 --> 01:08:07.833
<i>And I gave up on
those old trip switches years ago.</i>

01:08:08.001 --> 01:08:11.378
<i>Ten-second delay. Tut tut.
Dear, oh dear.</i>

01:08:11.546 --> 01:08:15.048
<i>Now, all you need to do
is answer one or two questions,</i>

01:08:15.216 --> 01:08:17.091
<i>and we can wrap this up full, quickly and clean.</i>

01:08:17.260 --> 01:08:21.054
<i>Otherwise, I have
a lovely soundproof basement.</i>

01:08:21.221 --> 01:08:22.723
<i>I can rig up a saline drip,</i>

01:08:22.932 --> 01:08:26.727
<i>and we can make it last a
couple of crispy, crunchy weeks.</i>

01:08:26.935 --> 01:08:30.606
<i>And after that, I'll go and find
that lovely daughter of yours, in...</i>

01:08:30.773 --> 01:08:32.399
<i>Where is she? Lupiana?</i>

01:08:32.567 --> 01:08:34.276
<i>Please don't hurt her.</i>

01:08:34.402 --> 01:08:36.361
<i>Who's replacing me?</i>

01:08:36.529 --> 01:08:38.113
<i>Sean Moody.</i>

01:08:38.281 --> 01:08:40.657
<i>Ah, my favourite Scotsman.
Is he in town already?</i>

01:08:40.867 --> 01:08:42.868
<i>He's at the Hotel Riviera.</i>

01:08:43.036 --> 01:08:45.787
<i>Marvellous. Thank you so much.</i>

01:08:45.997 --> 01:08:47.913
<i>It was nothing personal, Helen you know.</i>

01:08:48.082 --> 01:08:51.627
<i>Oh, no, of course not.
I always liked you, Bob.</i>

01:08:51.794 --> 01:08:54.587
<i>Now, do you need a moment?</i>

01:09:25.411 --> 01:09:27.496
<i>Look at you, sweetheart.</i>

01:09:27.663 --> 01:09:32.376
<i>You are a wee fucking ride,
so you are.</i>

01:09:36.296 --> 01:09:37.839
<i>Fucking hell, man.</i>

01:09:46.224 --> 01:09:47.557
<i>Oh, man.</i>

01:09:47.725 --> 01:09:49.850
<i>Oh, I'm a big man, huh?</i>

01:09:51.062 --> 01:09:54.106
<i>Look at that fella.
You could cut diamonds with that.</i>

01:09:55.483 --> 01:09:58.902
<i>Fuck. Who the fuck is this?</i>

01:09:59.070 --> 01:10:00.654
<i>- Hello? Moody.
- It's Carver.</i>

01:10:00.822 --> 01:10:02.489
<i>- What?
- Carver. We found the girl.</i>

01:10:02.657 --> 01:10:05.492
<i>Aye, hang on, hang on,
let me get a fucking pen.</i>

01:10:34.355 --> 01:10:36.690
<i>Anthony.</i>

01:10:36.858 --> 01:10:38.442
<i>Can you take him, please?</i>

01:10:38.568 --> 01:10:40.193
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:10:40.361 --> 01:10:42.237
<i>OK.</i>

01:10:47.994 --> 01:10:50.454
<i>You smell good.</i>

01:10:50.746 --> 01:10:53.039
<i>We found her.</i>

01:10:55.334 --> 01:10:57.544
<i>You see
how many people there are?</i>

01:10:57.712 --> 01:10:59.671
<i>Of all those people,
we found your mom.</i>

01:10:59.839 --> 01:11:02.757
<i>Everything's OK on the bed.</i>

01:11:02.967 --> 01:11:06.011
<i>Are you going to do
gymnastics for me?</i>

01:11:06.179 --> 01:11:07.804
<i>Yeah? Side, side.</i>

01:11:08.014 --> 01:11:09.598
<i>A little break dance.</i>

01:11:09.765 --> 01:11:11.641
<i>Yeah!</i>

01:11:11.809 --> 01:11:14.144
<i>Chook, chook! Take my nose.</i>

01:11:14.312 --> 01:11:16.480
<i>I don't need it.
I've smelled enough stuff.</i>

01:11:16.606 --> 01:11:18.273
<i>Go on, take it, take it.</i>

01:11:18.441 --> 01:11:20.817
<i>I know, I know.</i>

01:11:25.740 --> 01:11:27.491
<i>He was asking for you.</i>

01:11:27.617 --> 01:11:30.494
<i>- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah, he's very impatient.</i>

01:11:39.795 --> 01:11:41.213
<i>This one, this one, this one.</i>

01:11:41.380 --> 01:11:44.007
<i>How many words do you think
you'll be able to say...?</i>

01:11:51.724 --> 01:11:53.642
<i>Thank you.</i>

01:11:55.436 --> 01:11:57.521
<i>You're welcome.</i>

01:11:59.357 --> 01:12:03.109
<i>Low fucking profile?
Under fucking cover?</i>

01:12:03.277 --> 01:12:05.779
<i>What the fuck
do you call this thing?</i>

01:12:05.947 --> 01:12:08.615
<i>- Mr Moody, right?
- That's me, pal.</i>

01:12:08.783 --> 01:12:10.408
<i>What's happening?</i>

01:12:10.535 --> 01:12:14.287
<i>They've been in hotel room 502
for the past three hours.</i>

01:12:14.455 --> 01:12:18.917
<i>Listen, Mr Moody, all due respect,
but why we not coming with you?</i>

01:12:19.126 --> 01:12:20.877
<i>I mean, we follow them for days.</i>

01:12:21.087 --> 01:12:22.671
<i>Why are we cut out now, man?</i>

01:12:22.838 --> 01:12:25.090
<i>Cos you're a couple of
fucking ball-bag cunts.</i>

01:12:25.258 --> 01:12:26.758
<i>What'd your boss tell you?</i>

01:12:26.926 --> 01:12:30.345
<i>Well, um, he told us that
you are some kind of terrorist specialist</i>

01:12:30.513 --> 01:12:33.223
<i>and you have to handle this alone,
but...</i>

01:12:33.391 --> 01:12:35.892
<i>Well, there you go.
Do us a wee favour.</i>

01:12:36.102 --> 01:12:40.230
<i>Sit here, eat your sweeties,
jerk off in your coffee cup,</i>

01:12:40.398 --> 01:12:43.817
<i>and shut your fucking mouth,
you ethnic-cleansing pricks.</i>

01:12:45.236 --> 01:12:46.820
<i>I like this guy!</i>

01:12:58.916 --> 01:13:00.542
<i>Shh.</i>

01:13:00.668 --> 01:13:03.086
<i>Nae cunt fucking moves.</i>

01:13:03.254 --> 01:13:06.256
<i>On your feet, Nancy boy.</i>

01:13:06.424 --> 01:13:09.009
<i>Any chance
you have the wrong room?</i>

01:13:09.218 --> 01:13:10.677
<i>No.</i>

01:13:10.845 --> 01:13:13.305
<i>On your feet, pal.</i>

01:13:21.939 --> 01:13:24.107
<i>What's going on? Who are you?</i>

01:13:27.403 --> 01:13:28.987
<i>Right, listen.</i>

01:13:29.196 --> 01:13:31.615
<i>You are all going to die
in a few minutes.</i>

01:13:31.741 --> 01:13:36.411
<i>Now, how you die, well,
that's up to doll-face here.</i>

01:13:36.579 --> 01:13:38.830
<i>Now I want it...</i>

01:13:38.998 --> 01:13:43.376
<i>Is that a wean? For fuck's sake.
I've not killed a wean for ages.</i>

01:13:43.544 --> 01:13:47.631
<i>- Please. Please.
- I've been watching you, hen.</i>

01:13:47.757 --> 01:13:49.799
<i>Look at me
when I'm talking to you.</i>

01:13:49.967 --> 01:13:52.010
<i>You're a pure ride, so you are, you see.</i>

01:13:52.219 --> 01:13:54.679
<i>I just got back
from doing a wee job in Kabul.</i>

01:13:54.847 --> 01:13:59.017
<i>You've got more chance of getting
laid in a fucking nunnery than you have there.</i>

01:13:59.226 --> 01:14:02.854
<i>My balls, they are
fucking busting, so they are.</i>

01:14:03.022 --> 01:14:06.566
<i>So if you'll just give us
a wee gobble,</i>

01:14:06.692 --> 01:14:09.444
<i>you can all have a dose
of Mr Sweet Dreams here.</i>

01:14:09.612 --> 01:14:11.029
<i>But if you will nae...</i>

01:14:12.865 --> 01:14:17.243
<i>well, then, I'm afraid,
it's going to get a wee bit messy.</i>

01:14:17.411 --> 01:14:21.289
<i>Sorry, but I don't understand
anything that you just said.</i>

01:14:21.457 --> 01:14:22.916
<i>For fuck's sake, man!</i>

01:14:23.084 --> 01:14:26.294
<i>Does nae cunt speak English
in this fucking country?</i>

01:14:26.462 --> 01:14:29.005
<i>Just say it again, please.</i>

01:14:30.466 --> 01:14:35.679
<i>If... you... suck... my dick, huh?</i>

01:14:35.846 --> 01:14:37.764
<i>You got me so far? Capiche, no?</i>

01:14:37.932 --> 01:14:41.893
<i>If you suck my dick,
I will kill you all quickly.</i>

01:14:42.061 --> 01:14:43.478
<i>But if no...</i>

01:14:45.189 --> 01:14:47.649
<i>I will cut
soft lad's little prick off here</i>

01:14:47.775 --> 01:14:50.610
<i>and stuff it in his fucking mouth.</i>

01:14:50.736 --> 01:14:52.737
<i>Comprende?
Are you with me now?</i>

01:14:52.905 --> 01:14:55.281
<i>That's enough. Enough.
Leave her alone.</i>

01:14:57.076 --> 01:14:59.703
<i>Oh, Anthony, Anthony,
don't do anything, please.</i>

01:14:59.829 --> 01:15:03.373
<i>I don't usually like to interfere
but you're being a dick.</i>

01:15:03.541 --> 01:15:05.083
<i>You don't like to interfere?</i>

01:15:05.292 --> 01:15:07.752
<i>Hang on, son.
Hang on just a minute. Hang on.</i>

01:15:13.718 --> 01:15:15.677
<i>Ho ho ho!</i>

01:15:15.803 --> 01:15:17.512
<i>For fuck's sake, son!</i>

01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:20.265
<i>You just canna get enough
of the ball-booting.</i>

01:15:20.433 --> 01:15:22.100
<i>You cann a get enough of it,
wee man.</i>

01:15:22.309 --> 01:15:24.811
<i>Cannae fucking get enough of it.
Sit doon.</i>

01:15:26.981 --> 01:15:29.399
<i>Now, where were we?</i>

01:15:31.318 --> 01:15:33.695
<i>Come on.
Say, keep that wean quiet.</i>

01:15:33.821 --> 01:15:35.363
<i>That's it. Lick your lips.</i>

01:15:35.531 --> 01:15:38.491
<i>Here comes the choo-choo.</i>

01:16:05.519 --> 01:16:08.480
<i>OK, what just happened?</i>

01:16:21.994 --> 01:16:23.787
<i>Shit.</i>

01:16:27.666 --> 01:16:29.167
<i>Who is it?</i>

01:16:29.376 --> 01:16:30.752
<i>It's Helen Bingham.</i>

01:16:30.878 --> 01:16:34.130
<i>Well I am not gonna hurt you I've just saved your lives.
Would you open the door, please?</i>

01:16:35.925 --> 01:16:37.801
<i>Or would you rather I call room service</i>

01:16:37.968 --> 01:16:40.553
<i>to clean up
the dead body on your bed?</i>

01:16:43.015 --> 01:16:44.933
<i>I'm not going to kill you.</i>

01:16:46.644 --> 01:16:48.311
<i>You can put the gun away now.</i>

01:16:49.855 --> 01:16:51.648
<i>Who was that guy?</i>

01:16:52.650 --> 01:16:54.692
<i>That was a Mr Sean Moody,</i>

01:16:54.819 --> 01:16:58.404
<i>a priapic killer of some repute
and my proposed replacement.</i>

01:16:58.572 --> 01:17:00.365
<i>But why'd his head blow off?</i>

01:17:00.533 --> 01:17:02.700
<i>Sub-sonic explosive tipped round.</i>

01:17:02.827 --> 01:17:05.745
<i>He deserved to go out with a bang.
Don`t you think?</i>

01:17:08.082 --> 01:17:11.918
<i>What're you calling
me for now, ya bastard?</i>

01:17:12.086 --> 01:17:14.003
<i>We've got a situation, Moody.</i>

01:17:14.171 --> 01:17:16.631
<i>Bingham got away.
Watch your back.</i>

01:17:16.799 --> 01:17:19.843
<i>Thank you,
Daniel. I'll pass that along.</i>

01:17:22.388 --> 01:17:24.055
<i>Who's paying you to kill us?</i>

01:17:24.223 --> 01:17:27.392
<i>- And why should we trust you?
- Very good questions</i>

01:17:27.560 --> 01:17:31.521
<i>but right now, we need to get out
of the country. Come along.</i>

01:17:43.033 --> 01:17:46.953
<i>I'd very much appreciate it if
you didn't mention my profession.</i>

01:17:48.455 --> 01:17:50.415
<i>Or the... fact that I... smoke.</i>

01:17:52.710 --> 01:17:55.128
<i>- Hello, Mummy.
- Oh, Helen!</i>

01:17:55.296 --> 01:17:58.423
<i>- What a nice surprise!
- Happy birthday, Mummy.</i>

01:17:58.591 --> 01:18:00.758
<i>Oh, darling,
you never forget, do you?</i>

01:18:00.885 --> 01:18:03.219
<i>- Of course not.
- And you've brought friends.</i>

01:18:03.429 --> 01:18:05.930
<i>Come in, everybody.
Come in, all of you.</i>

01:18:06.098 --> 01:18:07.974
<i>There we go. There we...</i>

01:18:08.142 --> 01:18:10.894
<i>Oh, my goodness!</i>

01:18:11.020 --> 01:18:14.022
<i>What wonderful creature is this?</i>

01:18:14.189 --> 01:18:15.815
<i>His name is Alex.</i>

01:18:15.941 --> 01:18:20.153
<i>Alex. He's beautiful. May I?</i>

01:18:21.488 --> 01:18:22.906
<i>Mm, yeah.</i>

01:18:23.073 --> 01:18:24.616
<i>Ooh!</i>

01:18:25.910 --> 01:18:27.827
<i>My goodness.</i>

01:18:27.953 --> 01:18:30.747
<i>- He likes you.
- Babies love me.</i>

01:18:30.915 --> 01:18:32.832
<i>And I love babies.</i>

01:18:32.958 --> 01:18:35.293
<i>They're a blessing.</i>

01:18:35.502 --> 01:18:39.130
<i>They're life's way of making up
for the way it all inevitably ends.</i>

01:18:39.298 --> 01:18:41.257
<i>You know, we all start off</i>

01:18:41.467 --> 01:18:44.677
<i>being wide-eyed little angels
like him...</i>

01:18:45.971 --> 01:18:47.347
<i>don't we, Helen?</i>

01:18:47.556 --> 01:18:50.600
<i>- Yes, Mummy. Shall we go in?
- Of course. Come on everybody.</i>

01:18:50.768 --> 01:18:53.937
<i>This cake is just scrumptious.</i>

01:18:55.147 --> 01:18:58.608
<i>I don't know how you did it
with what little I keep in mine.</i>

01:18:58.776 --> 01:19:00.526
<i>Oh, it's nothing.</i>

01:19:00.694 --> 01:19:03.112
<i>Helen, darling,
have you gained weight?</i>

01:19:03.280 --> 01:19:06.240
<i>I think perhaps you've
had enough of that sweet stuff.</i>

01:19:06.450 --> 01:19:09.118
<i>Darling,
you're not a young girl any more.</i>

01:19:09.286 --> 01:19:11.287
<i>You need to take care of yourself.</i>

01:19:11.497 --> 01:19:15.083
<i>After all, I won't always be around
to look after you, you know.</i>

01:19:15.250 --> 01:19:17.752
<i>Yes. Mummy,
isn't it time you went back to bed?</i>

01:19:17.920 --> 01:19:19.337
<i>It's getting terribly late.</i>

01:19:19.546 --> 01:19:23.257
<i>Oh. All right, all right.
I know when I'm not wanted.</i>

01:19:23.467 --> 01:19:27.762
<i>And I do think all that sugar's
made me feel very tired.</i>

01:19:27.930 --> 01:19:31.516
<i>Now, Helen you know where the extra
blankets and pillows are don`t you darling?</i>

01:19:31.684 --> 01:19:33.101
<i>Yes, course.</i>

01:19:33.268 --> 01:19:37.021
<i>Thank you all for a very,
very grand birthday party.</i>

01:19:37.189 --> 01:19:38.731
<i>Bless you. Darling.</i>

01:19:38.899 --> 01:19:40.692
<i>I do love you, you know.</i>

01:19:40.859 --> 01:19:42.902
<i>- Yes. Love you, too, Mummy.
- Good night.</i>

01:19:43.028 --> 01:19:44.988
<i>- Night-night.
- Good night.</i>

01:19:45.155 --> 01:19:46.990
<i>- Good night.
- Good night, Mrs Bingham.</i>

01:19:47.116 --> 01:19:48.783
<i>Well, that explains a lot.</i>

01:19:48.951 --> 01:19:52.203
<i>Now, we need to
get that hard drive back.</i>

01:19:52.371 --> 01:19:54.789
<i>What makes you think he hasn`t wiped it clean already?</i>

01:19:54.957 --> 01:19:58.042
<i>Jakovic's company makes
weapon systems for the military.</i>

01:19:58.210 --> 01:20:00.378
<i>He won't give that up.
It's leverage.</i>

01:20:00.587 --> 01:20:03.256
<i>But they'd both be finished
if the film got out.</i>

01:20:03.424 --> 01:20:06.009
<i>Krebb only needs to know
that Jakovic has the footage.</i>

01:20:06.176 --> 01:20:09.387
<i>He never needs to use it.
It's nuclear brinkmanship.</i>

01:20:16.186 --> 01:20:17.687
<i>Cat, what's wrong?</i>

01:20:17.855 --> 01:20:19.605
<i>Whoa!
Where are you going with that?</i>

01:20:19.773 --> 01:20:21.566
<i>- Cat?
- Fuck all this shit.</i>

01:20:21.734 --> 01:20:23.276
<i>You killed Grushenka.</i>

01:20:23.444 --> 01:20:26.195
<i>Put the gun away, child,
you'll hurt yourself.</i>

01:20:26.363 --> 01:20:28.740
<i>How can you just kill
innocent people?</i>

01:20:28.907 --> 01:20:32.785
<i>I don't know. I've never met
an innocent person.</i>

01:20:32.953 --> 01:20:35.288
<i>The only difference
between my professions and yours.</i>

01:20:35.456 --> 01:20:39.959
<i>is that when I blow people away,
they don't ejaculate on my breasts.</i>

01:20:46.216 --> 01:20:47.800
<i>Feeling better?</i>

01:20:47.968 --> 01:20:50.178
<i>Tell me why
I shouldn't just kill you now.</i>

01:20:50.345 --> 01:20:55.016
<i>Because there'll be another
Sean Moody along in a minute.</i>

01:20:55.142 --> 01:20:57.060
<i>Or another Helen Bingham.</i>

01:20:57.227 --> 01:21:01.022
<i>We are the only people who know
what's on that hard drive.</i>

01:21:01.148 --> 01:21:03.691
<i>If we don't find it
and expose it to the world,</i>

01:21:03.859 --> 01:21:05.359
<i>then we're all dead.</i>

01:21:05.569 --> 01:21:09.614
<i>I don't kill babies but my colleagues
would have no such compunction.</i>

01:21:09.782 --> 01:21:11.449
<i>They will find you and Alex,</i>

01:21:11.658 --> 01:21:15.369
<i>and they will kill you in the most creative
way they can possibly think of</i>

01:21:15.579 --> 01:21:17.246
<i>and you will just disappear without a trace.</i>

01:21:17.414 --> 01:21:21.084
<i>Now, shall we get back
to business, my dear?</i>

01:21:21.210 --> 01:21:23.377
<i>You are going to
get us into this party.</i>

01:21:23.587 --> 01:21:25.463
<i>Me?</i>

01:21:25.672 --> 01:21:29.133
<i>I hacked into the guest list.
One of your co-workers is on it.</i>

01:21:29.301 --> 01:21:30.802
<i>You need to give her a call</i>

01:21:30.969 --> 01:21:33.429
<i>and offer her
double what she's being paid.</i>

01:21:33.639 --> 01:21:35.348
<i>And how's your Scottish accent?</i>

01:21:35.516 --> 01:21:36.974
<i>Scottish... Oh, it's terrible.</i>

01:21:38.227 --> 01:21:40.686
<i>A wean? For fuck's sake.</i>

01:21:40.854 --> 01:21:44.816
<i>I've not seen a wean for ages.</i>

01:21:44.983 --> 01:21:46.734
<i>Oh, dear.</i>

01:21:46.902 --> 01:21:48.486
<i>I-I could try.</i>

01:21:50.781 --> 01:21:56.994
<i>Aye, is that a wean? Fuck's sake!
I've not killed a wean for ages.</i>

01:21:57.121 --> 01:21:59.288
<i>- Aye.
- Lovely.</i>

01:22:10.968 --> 01:22:12.635
<i>Hello there.</i>

01:22:12.803 --> 01:22:14.178
<i>labella?</i>

01:22:14.346 --> 01:22:16.764
<i>Ho ho!</i>

01:22:16.932 --> 01:22:20.226
<i>I could fall in love with you,
so I could.</i>

01:22:22.104 --> 01:22:26.190
<i>Maurice did good.
Driver, here's the parking pass.</i>

01:22:28.068 --> 01:22:29.861
<i>Do you speak English?</i>

01:22:34.449 --> 01:22:37.577
<i>Hey, what are you doing?
Why are you stopping the car?</i>

01:22:37.786 --> 01:22:40.538
<i>Your regular driver
couldn't make it tonight.</i>

01:22:40.747 --> 01:22:42.415
<i>Hey?</i>

01:22:44.209 --> 01:22:46.794
<i>- Good evening.
- Who the fuck are y...?</i>

01:23:03.478 --> 01:23:06.522
<i>Could you open the trunk for us,
please?</i>

01:23:06.732 --> 01:23:08.900
<i>- Aye.
- Mr McPhee?</i>

01:23:09.067 --> 01:23:13.196
<i>Mr Angus Tyrone Denzel McPhee.</i>

01:23:13.363 --> 01:23:15.114
<i>Good evening</i>

01:23:15.240 --> 01:23:18.826
<i>- You RSVPd one person, sir.
- One whore or two, who cares?</i>

01:23:18.994 --> 01:23:22.622
<i>What difference does it make?</i>

01:23:22.831 --> 01:23:24.749
<i>It doesn't matter!</i>

01:23:26.877 --> 01:23:28.961
<i>Would you calm down?</i>

01:23:30.464 --> 01:23:32.632
<i>Move on. Move on, please.</i>

01:23:39.932 --> 01:23:41.766
<i>Don't be nervous.</i>

01:23:41.934 --> 01:23:43.809
<i>This is the fun bit.</i>

01:23:43.977 --> 01:23:45.561
<i>I'm fine.</i>

01:23:53.570 --> 01:23:55.279
<i>Here we go.</i>

01:23:55.447 --> 01:23:57.073
<i>Welcome.</i>

01:23:57.241 --> 01:23:59.242
<i>- Good evening.
- Aye, aye.</i>

01:24:08.669 --> 01:24:10.086
<i>Testing, testing.</i>

01:24:10.254 --> 01:24:11.879
<i>- Copy.
- Copy.</i>

01:24:12.047 --> 01:24:16.092
<i>- After you, my dear.
- I'm going downstairs with the drivers.</i>

01:24:17.219 --> 01:24:18.886
<i>Come on through.</i>

01:24:24.226 --> 01:24:26.269
<i>Keep calm. Keep smiling.</i>

01:24:34.194 --> 01:24:37.571
<i>Oh, "Ave Maria". How lovely.</i>

01:24:41.618 --> 01:24:43.828
<i>Three security on the upper floor.</i>

01:24:43.996 --> 01:24:47.290
<i>Are you sure we're
going to get away with this?</i>

01:24:48.834 --> 01:24:50.501
<i>Aye.</i>

01:25:00.929 --> 01:25:03.180
<i>Thank you so much
for hosting this thing.</i>

01:25:03.307 --> 01:25:06.976
<i>It's a nice party, beautiful home,
stunning daughters.</i>

01:25:07.144 --> 01:25:09.687
<i>Would you like
a tour of the house?</i>

01:25:09.896 --> 01:25:14.191
<i>Honey, er, let him catch
his breath, take a drink.</i>

01:25:16.486 --> 01:25:19.030
<i>Everyone remember their assignments?</i>

01:25:19.197 --> 01:25:21.324
<i>I'm a bit terrified, honestly.</i>

01:25:21.491 --> 01:25:23.617
<i>Oh, stiff upper lip, bro.</i>

01:25:32.210 --> 01:25:37.673
<i>What, hoots, man. It's a brawl,
bricht, moonlight night.</i>

01:25:37.883 --> 01:25:39.967
<i>- You're Scottish?
- I be, aye.</i>

01:25:40.135 --> 01:25:44.388
<i>You heard of a black lrish? Well,
I be a black-eyed Scotsman, aye.</i>

01:25:44.556 --> 01:25:47.266
<i>- What do you think I am.
- You don't look Scottish.</i>

01:25:47.392 --> 01:25:49.477
<i>I don't look Scottish?</i>

01:25:49.644 --> 01:25:51.145
<i>Is that what you said?</i>

01:25:51.313 --> 01:25:53.481
<i>You don't wanna know
what I think you look like.</i>

01:25:53.648 --> 01:25:57.151
<i>You look like a one-legged gypsy
whore of a goat herder.</i>

01:25:57.319 --> 01:25:59.403
<i>Don't make me slap you.</i>

01:25:59.571 --> 01:26:03.616
<i>I lift my kilt, you see my boots.
See my black snake moan. Sss.</i>

01:26:03.784 --> 01:26:06.243
<i>- It may bite you...
- Is there a problem?</i>

01:26:06.370 --> 01:26:10.331
<i>- Sir, we need you to calm down.
- What`s the problem. You want me to calm down?</i>

01:26:10.457 --> 01:26:13.626
<i>Don't make me slap... Look
at me when I'm talking to you.</i>

01:26:14.252 --> 01:26:16.462
<i>Excuse me. You can't be up here.</i>

01:26:16.630 --> 01:26:19.590
<i>I was looking for the ladies room.
I've broken my necklace.</i>

01:26:19.758 --> 01:26:22.385
<i>- Just go downstairs, please.
- Would you mine hold that?</i>

01:26:26.056 --> 01:26:28.182
<i>All clear on the upper floor.</i>

01:26:28.350 --> 01:26:29.767
<i>On my way.</i>

01:26:41.822 --> 01:26:44.323
<i>- Can I help you?
- No, I'm good. Sorry.</i>

01:26:44.449 --> 01:26:45.825
<i>Then get out.</i>

01:26:53.792 --> 01:26:58.212
<i>Krebb's got a small army down here,
fully armed. Just a little heads up.</i>

01:27:03.343 --> 01:27:05.219
<i>Come in.</i>

01:27:06.680 --> 01:27:09.306
<i>Am I interrupting anything?</i>

01:27:09.433 --> 01:27:14.145
<i>- Good evening, Daniel.
- Helen.</i>

01:27:14.312 --> 01:27:16.522
<i>I'm so glad you could make it.</i>

01:27:16.690 --> 01:27:18.607
<i>I like your new look.</i>

01:27:18.775 --> 01:27:20.484
<i>Well, thank you.</i>

01:27:20.652 --> 01:27:23.154
<i>You look... marvellous.</i>

01:27:23.321 --> 01:27:26.240
<i>You look very elegant, yourself.</i>

01:27:32.456 --> 01:27:34.457
<i>Is it morning already?</i>

01:27:34.624 --> 01:27:36.125
<i>Excuse me?</i>

01:27:36.293 --> 01:27:39.420
<i>I just saw the sun rise,
and it's blinding me.</i>

01:27:41.465 --> 01:27:44.508
<i>I have to introduce a political film,
same old stuff,</i>

01:27:44.676 --> 01:27:49.305
<i>- but afterwards, we could...
- Be terribly naughty?</i>

01:27:49.473 --> 01:27:52.600
<i>Oh, I'd like that.
I'd like that a lot.</i>

01:27:52.767 --> 01:27:55.102
<i>Sir, it's time for your speech.</i>

01:27:56.396 --> 01:27:57.897
<i>Promise me you'll wait?</i>

01:27:58.106 --> 01:28:00.191
<i>Say the magic word.</i>

01:28:25.675 --> 01:28:30.471
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome Mr William Krebb.</i>

01:28:35.143 --> 01:28:36.727
<i>Thank you so much.</i>

01:28:36.895 --> 01:28:40.898
<i>First, on behalf of myself and
all the people of the USA,</i>

01:28:41.107 --> 01:28:44.735
<i>A big thank you to our gracious hosts
for opening their beautiful home.</i>

01:28:44.903 --> 01:28:46.946
<i>Ivana and Branco Jakovic.</i>

01:28:47.155 --> 01:28:48.822
<i>How about a hand for them?</i>

01:28:52.410 --> 01:28:55.037
<i>For many travels
throughout this region, over the years</i>

01:28:55.205 --> 01:28:59.250
<i>I have never felt anything but warmth
and welcoming in their home,</i>

01:28:59.417 --> 01:29:03.170
<i>and they always shown me an excellent time
in their beautiful country.</i>

01:29:03.338 --> 01:29:06.632
<i>Speaking of beautiful countries,
I don't know how you do it</i>

01:29:06.800 --> 01:29:09.426
<i>but the women in Eastern Europe
are absolutely gorgeous.</i>

01:29:09.553 --> 01:29:11.720
<i>Must be something in the water.</i>

01:29:15.141 --> 01:29:17.518
<i>I don't suppose Razwell gave
you too much trouble.</i>

01:29:17.644 --> 01:29:19.728
<i>No, no, no, Bob was a sweetheart.</i>

01:29:19.896 --> 01:29:21.564
<i>- Thank you, Daniel.
- My pleasure.</i>

01:29:23.400 --> 01:29:24.817
<i>- Who is it?
- It's me.</i>

01:29:24.985 --> 01:29:26.569
<i>Come in.</i>

01:29:28.989 --> 01:29:31.156
<i>- Who's this?
- I'm an associate.</i>

01:29:31.324 --> 01:29:33.284
<i>Hi, how are you?</i>

01:29:33.451 --> 01:29:35.119
<i>I'm fine.</i>

01:29:35.287 --> 01:29:38.289
<i>I'm assuming you have access
to various slush funds</i>

01:29:38.456 --> 01:29:39.957
<i>on behalf of your employer.</i>

01:29:40.166 --> 01:29:43.294
<i>If you please kind transfer
everything you can lay your hands on</i>

01:29:43.461 --> 01:29:46.547
<i>into this account,
I'd be most grateful.</i>

01:29:48.592 --> 01:29:51.885
<i>Now, I have
a little audio-visual programme,</i>

01:29:52.095 --> 01:29:54.597
<i>if I can figure out
how to work this.</i>

01:29:54.764 --> 01:29:56.807
<i>- Sir, can I help?
- This way? Yeah.</i>

01:29:59.102 --> 01:30:01.687
<i>- There you go.
- Well, that was easy. Thank you.</i>

01:30:01.855 --> 01:30:04.773
<i>I got the disk. I'm on my way.</i>

01:30:04.941 --> 01:30:08.319
<i>For the record, Helen,
it wasn't my idea.</i>

01:30:08.486 --> 01:30:10.863
<i>Of course not. Powers that be.</i>

01:30:11.031 --> 01:30:12.781
<i>Let's see how we've done.</i>

01:30:12.949 --> 01:30:15.951
<i>17 million and change.
Oh, yummy.</i>

01:30:17.704 --> 01:30:21.248
<i>- Are you sure you're up for this?
- Damn you.</i>

01:30:27.505 --> 01:30:30.758
<i>As many of you know, I have
been travelling through the region</i>

01:30:30.925 --> 01:30:34.845
<i>assuring our allies that
the anti-ballistic missile shield</i>

01:30:35.013 --> 01:30:37.640
<i>will give our troops
and our allies in Eastern Europe</i>

01:30:37.807 --> 01:30:40.059
<i>a new level of safety and security.</i>

01:30:41.269 --> 01:30:42.895
<i>Queensberry Rules?</i>

01:30:43.063 --> 01:30:44.480
<i>Of course.</i>

01:31:00.455 --> 01:31:02.456
<i>Nice.</i>

01:31:13.885 --> 01:31:15.969
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

01:31:16.221 --> 01:31:19.098
<i>Need to replace the HDMl cables
and reroute the components.</i>

01:31:19.307 --> 01:31:23.018
<i>If we don't get 1080p video,
we're all dead. I'm with ATl.</i>

01:31:23.228 --> 01:31:26.438
<i>Understand?
It means, get the fuck out.</i>

01:31:26.606 --> 01:31:30.317
<i>We have been facing a complex
and challenging new set of threats</i>

01:31:30.485 --> 01:31:31.902
<i>for this region.</i>

01:31:32.070 --> 01:31:35.948
<i>lran's ballistic missiles prove to
be a significant risk to this area.</i>

01:31:36.116 --> 01:31:40.077
<i>The proposed ground-based...
interceptors...</i>

01:31:40.286 --> 01:31:42.746
<i>..will...</i>

01:31:44.499 --> 01:31:46.417
<i>Will what?</i>

01:31:49.003 --> 01:31:50.963
<i>Naughty, naughty.</i>

01:31:53.299 --> 01:31:54.758
<i>You didn't say the magic word.</i>

01:31:54.926 --> 01:31:57.720
<i>- You must be Mrs Jakovic.
- Yes.</i>

01:31:57.846 --> 01:32:02.099
<i>I can't believe I've been here
so many times and we never met.</i>

01:32:02.308 --> 01:32:04.101
<i>Who on earth is this person?</i>

01:32:04.310 --> 01:32:06.729
<i>I'm one of your husband's whores.</i>

01:32:12.152 --> 01:32:14.653
<i>Let's see, hmm.</i>

01:32:14.779 --> 01:32:18.657
<i>"America's commitment
to its allies."</i>

01:32:18.783 --> 01:32:24.329
<i>Well, if that commitment includes
covering up sodomy and murder,</i>

01:32:24.497 --> 01:32:28.542
<i>I guess Branco and Bill here
are your guys.</i>

01:32:34.799 --> 01:32:38.510
<i>- That's enough of that.
- No, it's not enough. Not nearly.</i>

01:32:38.678 --> 01:32:40.971
<i>Home movie time.</i>

01:32:50.774 --> 01:32:53.192
<i>Stop! What are you doing?</i>

01:32:54.944 --> 01:32:56.779
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

01:32:57.781 --> 01:32:59.782
<i>What did you do?!</i>

01:32:59.949 --> 01:33:02.868
<i>Sabina! Sabina!</i>

01:33:03.036 --> 01:33:04.661
<i>Wake up.</i>

01:33:04.788 --> 01:33:07.039
<i>- Take this... Get it off now.
- Someone stop him!</i>

01:33:07.207 --> 01:33:09.124
<i>Now!</i>

01:33:25.809 --> 01:33:28.977
<i>What are you doing? Come with me.</i>

01:33:29.145 --> 01:33:30.687
<i>Whoo!</i>

01:33:30.814 --> 01:33:33.649
<i>- You're beautiful.
- Ready for more?</i>

01:33:35.819 --> 01:33:38.070
<i>No-one in or out.
Full containment.</i>

01:33:38.238 --> 01:33:41.573
<i>- Full containment. Understood.
- OK, guys, we're on. Let's go.</i>

01:33:56.631 --> 01:33:58.131
<i>Do you need a moment?</i>

01:34:11.771 --> 01:34:14.022
<i>Stop. Hands up. Now.</i>

01:34:16.234 --> 01:34:18.402
<i>Who the hell are you?</i>

01:34:18.570 --> 01:34:21.738
<i>I'm Carver's man. How do you do?</i>

01:34:21.865 --> 01:34:24.867
<i>Ah, it's nice to finally meet you.</i>

01:34:24.993 --> 01:34:27.578
<i>Everybody
move into the main ballroom.</i>

01:34:27.745 --> 01:34:29.454
<i>Move, please.</i>

01:34:29.622 --> 01:34:34.126
<i>Let's go. Main ballroom. Move.</i>

01:34:34.294 --> 01:34:37.129
<i>You two, Pixie and Dixie,
how do you fit into all this?</i>

01:34:37.297 --> 01:34:39.006
<i>We're private investigators.</i>

01:34:41.509 --> 01:34:42.968
<i>That's great.</i>

01:34:43.136 --> 01:34:45.888
<i>Why is that everybody find that funny?
Man, we got a website.</i>

01:34:46.055 --> 01:34:48.891
<i>You seem be forgetting that all those people
just saw that tape.</i>

01:34:49.017 --> 01:34:51.935
<i>Ah, yes, those poor people.</i>

01:34:52.103 --> 01:34:55.397
<i>innocent victims
of another terrorist atrocity.</i>

01:34:55.565 --> 01:34:58.191
<i>What are you using there? C4?
HMX?</i>

01:34:58.401 --> 01:35:00.027
<i>What is this, 1982?</i>

01:35:00.194 --> 01:35:03.322
<i>This is ONC, Octanitrocubane.</i>

01:35:03.531 --> 01:35:06.325
<i>The most powerful non-nuclear
explosive currently in development.</i>

01:35:06.534 --> 01:35:09.578
<i>A sugar cube of this shit
would take out a tank.</i>

01:35:09.746 --> 01:35:13.457
<i>My, my. You're really
going all the way, aren't you?</i>

01:35:13.625 --> 01:35:15.834
<i>Yes, I'm all in on this hand.</i>

01:35:16.920 --> 01:35:18.295
<i>Excuse me, please.</i>

01:35:18.504 --> 01:35:20.714
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
may I have your attention?</i>

01:35:20.882 --> 01:35:23.967
<i>We have an active situation.
We have gunmen on the premises.</i>

01:35:24.135 --> 01:35:26.970
<i>We are keeping you in here
for your safety.</i>

01:35:27.138 --> 01:35:29.181
<i>We have refreshments for you.
Please enjoy.</i>

01:35:29.349 --> 01:35:32.476
<i>Hopefully, the matter will be
resolved very quickly.</i>

01:35:32.644 --> 01:35:36.897
<i>- Did somebody call the cops?
- Nobody wants any food.</i>

01:35:42.278 --> 01:35:43.862
<i>Bill, wait, you can't do it.</i>

01:35:43.988 --> 01:35:46.823
<i>Come on, Bill, my wife
and daughters are downstairs.</i>

01:35:59.170 --> 01:36:01.505
<i>Sir, now's the time to leave.</i>

01:36:01.673 --> 01:36:04.925
<i>- Take care of them.
- Yes, sir.</i>

01:36:08.721 --> 01:36:11.682
<i>- Is the code all set?
- Yes, sir. Just hit send.</i>

01:36:11.849 --> 01:36:13.558
<i>Like to blow up
a lot of this country.</i>

01:36:13.726 --> 01:36:15.686
<i>Except for the beautiful women.</i>

01:36:20.066 --> 01:36:21.733
<i>What are you doing?</i>

01:36:24.487 --> 01:36:26.488
<i>Wait. Before you shoot us all,</i>

01:36:26.656 --> 01:36:30.993
<i>there's just one thing
I wanted to do before I die.</i>

01:37:24.756 --> 01:37:27.132
<i>Down! Down! Down!</i>

01:37:38.895 --> 01:37:40.353
<i>What's our contingency plan?</i>

01:37:40.563 --> 01:37:42.981
<i>First things first. We need to get you in the air
immediately.</i>

01:37:43.107 --> 01:37:46.109
<i>There's a bird standing by
at a private airstrip.</i>

01:37:46.277 --> 01:37:49.196
<i>In the meantime, I'm working on a plan
to make this all disappear.</i>

01:37:52.200 --> 01:37:55.619
<i>Pay attention.
Go out the back way.</i>

01:37:55.787 --> 01:37:58.413
<i>I have a little business
to attend to.</i>

01:37:58.623 --> 01:38:01.291
<i>Catalina. Take this.</i>

01:38:01.459 --> 01:38:03.960
<i>- What is it?
- Something for a rainy day.</i>

01:38:04.087 --> 01:38:06.129
<i>I'm sorry about your friend.</i>

01:38:06.297 --> 01:38:07.923
<i>It's the job.</i>

01:38:08.091 --> 01:38:10.258
<i>Numbs you.</i>

01:38:10.426 --> 01:38:12.177
<i>Look after Mummy, will you?</i>

01:38:16.724 --> 01:38:18.725
<i>Jesus.</i>

01:38:18.893 --> 01:38:21.103
<i>Come on. Go, go.</i>

01:38:23.981 --> 01:38:25.524
<i>Oh, man.</i>

01:38:25.733 --> 01:38:28.360
<i>Aaarghhhh!</i>

01:38:53.761 --> 01:38:55.637
<i>God forgive me.</i>

01:38:55.805 --> 01:38:59.141
<i>Who am I kidding? Here goes.</i>

01:39:03.938 --> 01:39:05.981
<i>It's not connecting.</i>

01:39:06.149 --> 01:39:08.859
<i>- You push "send", right?
- Yes. The code is set.</i>

01:39:09.026 --> 01:39:11.570
<i>What the helI's wrong
with this thing?</i>

01:39:24.667 --> 01:39:27.419
<i>Are you OK?</i>

01:39:27.587 --> 01:39:33.341
<i>I have a bomb!
Get back! Move!</i>

01:39:55.615 --> 01:39:57.616
<i>Ah, yeah, yeah, here it goes.</i>

01:40:02.538 --> 01:40:04.831
<i>- You got it?

<i>I was just starting to like her, too.</i>

01:40:33.736 --> 01:40:37.197
<i>She was cool. Killer cool.</i>

01:40:49.794 --> 01:40:53.046
<i>Good afternoon.
Ju-An Detective Agency.</i>

01:40:53.214 --> 01:40:54.798

01:41:26.580 --> 01:41:29.416

I've found an amazing house.</i>

01:41:35.464 --> 01:41:37.924
