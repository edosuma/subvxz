I wonder if they
want to dock here.

02:28.365 --> 02:29.248
Bye-bye!

02:29.250 --> 02:30.549
Someone should guide them

Yeah, it's getting dark.

04:37.010 --> 04:37.709
(Laughing)

04:37.711 --> 04:38.160
Whoa!

04:38.161 --> 04:38.610
(Laughing)

04:38.612 --> 04:39.128
(Splashing)

04:39.129 --> 04:39.645
(Laughing)

04:39.647 --> 04:40.079
I'm good.

04:40.080 --> 04:40.512
(Laughing)

04:40.514 --> 04:41.330
Totally cool idea.

04:41.331 --> 04:42.147
(Laughing)

04:42.149 --> 04:43.449
Let's all dive in.

04:43.450 --> 04:44.750
(Laughing)

04:44.752 --> 04:45.985
(Splashing)

04:45.986 --> 04:47.219
(Laughing)

04:47.888 --> 04:58.230
¶

05:02.603 --> 05:03.468
Whoo-hoo!

05:03.470 --> 05:04.603
Being a merpup rules!

05:04.604 --> 05:05.737
Whoo-hoo!

05:05.739 --> 05:07.639
This merpup's got to
make a splash.

05:07.640 --> 05:09.540
Whoo-hoo!

05:09.543 --> 05:09.942
Keep splashing.

05:09.943 --> 05:10.342
Whoo-hoo!

05:10.344 --> 05:12.344
Now that I'm a
merpup, I love water.

05:12.345 --> 05:14.345
Whoo-hoo!

05:15.416 --> 05:17.716
(Yipping)

05:17.718 --> 05:18.784
A giant pearl!

05:18.785 --> 05:19.851
(Yipping)

05:19.853 --> 05:21.053
How beautiful.

05:21.054 --> 05:22.254
(Yipping)

05:22.256 --> 05:22.871
And fun.

05:22.872 --> 05:23.487
(Yipping)

05:23.490 --> 05:24.840
Coming your way, Rocky.

05:24.841 --> 05:26.191
(Yipping)

05:26.193 --> 05:26.775
(Grunting)

05:26.776 --> 05:27.358
(Yipping)

05:27.361 --> 05:28.110
(Yipping)

05:28.111 --> 05:28.860
(Yipping)

05:28.862 --> 05:29.978
SID:
A giant merpup pearl?

05:29.979 --> 05:31.095
(Yipping)

05:31.098 --> 05:31.647
I've never seen one.

05:31.648 --> 05:32.197
(Yipping)

05:32.199 --> 05:32.948
But now I need it!

05:32.949 --> 05:33.698
(Yipping)

05:33.701 --> 05:34.316
I need it!

05:34.317 --> 05:34.932
(Yipping)

05:34.935 --> 05:35.501
(Barking)

05:35.502 --> 05:36.068
(Yipping)

05:36.070 --> 05:38.320
Pups, I think she wants
us to follow her underwater.

05:38.321 --> 05:40.571
(Yipping)

05:40.574 --> 05:41.073
Sure!

05:41.074 --> 05:41.573
(Yipping)

05:41.575 --> 05:43.275
Maybe she wants
to show us Puplantis.

05:43.276 --> 05:44.976
(Yipping)

05:44.978 --> 05:46.978
Oh, wait for me, and my camera!

05:46.979 --> 05:48.979
(Yipping)

05:49.550 --> 05:50.549
(Howling)

05:50.551 --> 05:50.983
(Laughing)

05:50.984 --> 05:51.416
(Howling)

05:51.418 --> 05:53.702
(Merpups yipping)

05:53.703 --> 05:55.987
(Howling)

05:57.424 --> 05:58.557
Did you hear that, Arrby?

05:58.559 --> 05:59.658
Those fishy pups and
their pearl sound close.

05:59.659 --> 06:00.758
Did you hear that, Arrby?

06:00.761 --> 06:02.928
If they are, I'll find them,
Cap'n, boss, Mr. Sid, sir.

06:02.929 --> 06:05.096
Did you hear that, Arrby?

06:05.099 --> 06:05.547
Arr!

06:05.548 --> 06:05.996
Did you hear that, Arrby?

06:05.999 --> 06:07.215
(Clinking)

06:07.216 --> 06:08.432
Did you hear that, Arrby?

06:09.269 --> 06:11.603
(Radar pinging)

06:11.605 --> 06:12.087
CHASE:
Huh?

06:12.088 --> 06:12.570
(Radar pinging)

06:12.573 --> 06:14.189
Ryder, that boat we saw
is now heading the other way.

06:14.190 --> 06:15.806
(Radar pinging)

06:15.809 --> 06:17.192
<i> Maybe it's not coming</i>
<i> to shore anymore.</i>

06:17.193 --> 06:18.576
(Radar pinging)

06:18.579 --> 06:18.944
Hmm.

06:18.945 --> 06:19.310
(Radar pinging)

06:19.313 --> 06:21.046
Keep an eye on it in case
it still needs help coming in.

06:21.047 --> 06:22.780
(Radar pinging)

06:22.783 --> 06:23.398
<i> Aye-aye, Ryder.</i>

06:23.399 --> 06:24.014
(Radar pinging)

06:24.017 --> 06:25.150
<i> So, how's it going down there?</i>

06:25.151 --> 06:26.284
(Radar pinging)

06:26.286 --> 06:26.768
Awesome!

06:26.769 --> 06:27.251
(Radar pinging)

06:27.254 --> 06:28.554
We're going to see Puplantis!

06:28.555 --> 06:29.855
(Radar pinging)

06:29.857 --> 06:30.222
Oh, wow!

06:30.223 --> 06:30.588
(Radar pinging)

06:30.591 --> 06:31.757
A real underwater castle?

06:31.758 --> 06:32.924
(Radar pinging)

06:32.926 --> 06:33.975
I wish I could have seen that.

06:33.976 --> 06:35.025
(Radar pinging)

06:35.028 --> 06:36.244
(Sighing)

06:36.245 --> 06:37.461
(Radar pinging)

06:39.566 --> 06:40.565
(Laughing)

06:40.567 --> 06:41.733
Oopsy-pearl-sy.

06:41.734 --> 06:42.900
(Laughing)

06:42.903 --> 06:44.269
I'll get it.

06:44.270 --> 06:45.636
(Laughing)

06:45.639 --> 06:45.954
Hey!

06:45.955 --> 06:46.270
(Laughing)

06:46.273 --> 06:46.972
It's a pup in a dive suit.

06:46.973 --> 06:47.672
(Laughing)

06:47.674 --> 06:48.724
I got to get out of here.

06:48.725 --> 06:49.775
(Laughing)

06:49.777 --> 06:50.175
Uh, bye.

06:50.176 --> 06:50.574
(Laughing)

06:50.577 --> 06:51.777
I think he wants to
play with us.

06:51.778 --> 06:52.978
(Laughing)

06:52.980 --> 06:53.846
(Both howling)

06:53.847 --> 06:54.713
(Laughing)

06:54.715 --> 06:55.731
(Gasping)

06:55.732 --> 06:56.748
(Laughing)

06:56.750 --> 06:57.132
Uh-oh.

06:57.133 --> 06:57.515
(Laughing)

06:57.518 --> 06:58.050
Looks like you're stuck.

06:58.051 --> 06:58.583
(Laughing)

06:58.585 --> 06:59.334
Need some help?

06:59.335 --> 07:00.084
(Laughing)

07:00.087 --> 07:01.520
Uh, oh, um, hi.

07:01.521 --> 07:02.954
(Laughing)

07:02.956 --> 07:03.772
I'm Arrby.

07:03.773 --> 07:04.589
(Laughing)

07:04.591 --> 07:05.007
(Grunting)

07:05.008 --> 07:05.424
(Laughing)

07:05.426 --> 07:05.991
Nice to meet you, Arrby.

07:05.992 --> 07:06.557
(Laughing)

07:06.560 --> 07:06.975
We'll help you.

07:06.976 --> 07:07.391
(Laughing)

07:07.394 --> 07:08.961
Rocky, you free his leg,
and I'll take this.

07:08.962 --> 07:10.529
(Laughing)

07:10.531 --> 07:11.914
Thanks, Mr. Nice Boy
With All the Pups.

07:11.915 --> 07:13.298
(Laughing)

07:13.300 --> 07:14.316
But I kind of need that.

07:14.317 --> 07:15.333
(Laughing)

07:15.335 --> 07:16.201
First, let's get you unstuck.

07:16.202 --> 07:17.068
(Laughing)

07:17.070 --> 07:18.336
Then it's off to see Puplantis.

07:18.337 --> 07:19.603
(Laughing)

07:19.606 --> 07:20.572
There you go, Arrby.

07:20.573 --> 07:21.539
(Laughing)

07:21.542 --> 07:22.207
Puplantis?

07:22.208 --> 07:22.873
(Laughing)

07:22.876 --> 07:23.475
SID (ON RADIO):
<i> Ahoy, Arrby,</i>

07:23.476 --> 07:24.075
(Laughing)

07:24.077 --> 07:24.593
<i> my first and best mate.</i>

07:24.594 --> 07:25.110
(Laughing)

07:25.112 --> 07:27.029
<i> Remember, I need, need</i>
<i> that pearl!</i>

07:27.030 --> 07:28.947
(Laughing)

07:28.949 --> 07:29.281
Right.

07:29.282 --> 07:29.614
(Laughing)

07:29.616 --> 07:30.515
I'll get it, Captain Sid, sir.

07:30.516 --> 07:31.415
(Laughing)

07:31.418 --> 07:31.767
Hey, wait!

07:31.768 --> 07:32.117
(Laughing)

07:32.119 --> 07:33.402
I want to see Puplantis, too!

07:33.403 --> 07:34.686
(Laughing)

07:37.191 --> 07:38.690
SKYE:
Whoa!

07:38.692 --> 07:39.808
Where's the glow coming from?

07:39.809 --> 07:40.925
SKYE:
Whoa!

07:40.928 --> 07:41.810
It must be the lustrous,

07:41.811 --> 07:42.693
SKYE:
Whoa!

07:42.696 --> 07:44.046
luminous light of Puplantis!

07:44.047 --> 07:45.397
SKYE:
Whoa!

07:45.399 --> 07:46.565
(Howling and barking)

07:46.566 --> 07:47.732
SKYE:
Whoa!

07:47.734 --> 07:48.166
Alright!

07:48.167 --> 07:48.599
SKYE:
Whoa!

07:48.602 --> 07:49.835
Come on, Arrby.

07:49.836 --> 07:51.069
SKYE:
Whoa!

07:53.040 --> 07:55.006
(All exclaiming in amazement)

07:55.008 --> 07:57.325
(Barking and howling)

07:57.326 --> 07:59.643
(All exclaiming in amazement)

08:01.915 --> 08:04.449
ALL:
Wow!

08:07.120 --> 08:10.121
(Yipping)

08:10.123 --> 08:10.472
Look.

08:10.473 --> 08:10.822
(Yipping)

08:10.824 --> 08:11.840
The merpup put away
her toy pearl.

08:11.841 --> 08:12.857
(Yipping)

08:12.860 --> 08:13.425
The pearls aren't toys.

08:13.426 --> 08:13.991
(Yipping)

08:13.994 --> 08:15.227
They give the
merpups their magic.

08:15.228 --> 08:16.461
(Yipping)

08:16.463 --> 08:17.429
ARRBY:
Whoa!

08:17.430 --> 08:18.396
(Yipping)

08:18.398 --> 08:19.181
Look at them all.

08:19.182 --> 08:19.965
(Yipping)

08:19.967 --> 08:20.265
Arr!

08:20.266 --> 08:20.564
(Yipping)

08:20.567 --> 08:21.566
I've never seen so much booty!

08:21.567 --> 08:22.566
(Yipping)

08:22.569 --> 08:23.518
And I definitely need it all!

08:23.519 --> 08:24.468
(Yipping)

08:24.471 --> 08:25.937
It won't be easy, Captain,
boss, Mr. Sid, sir,

08:25.938 --> 08:27.404
(Yipping)

08:27.407 --> 08:29.191
with everyone around,
but I'll try.

08:29.192 --> 08:30.976
(Yipping)

08:30.978 --> 08:31.744
ZUMA:
Whoa!

08:31.745 --> 08:32.511
(Yipping)

08:32.513 --> 08:33.779
How did they get all
these pearls?

08:33.780 --> 08:35.046
(Yipping)

08:35.048 --> 08:35.564
(Yipping)

08:35.565 --> 08:36.081
(Yipping)

08:36.083 --> 08:38.050
CAP'N TURBOT:
They come from the
ancient Shell of Puplantis.

08:38.051 --> 08:40.018
(Yipping)

08:40.020 --> 08:41.336
It makes magic pearls.

08:41.337 --> 08:42.653
(Yipping)

08:44.224 --> 08:46.458
Arr-mazing!

08:46.460 --> 08:47.059
ALL:
Wow!

08:47.060 --> 08:47.659
Arr-mazing!

08:47.661 --> 08:48.043
Awesome.

08:48.044 --> 08:48.426
Arr-mazing!

08:48.428 --> 08:49.361
Shell of Puplantis?

08:49.362 --> 08:50.295
Arr-mazing!

08:50.297 --> 08:52.397
I've never needed anything
as much as I've needed that!

08:52.398 --> 08:54.498
Arr-mazing!

08:54.501 --> 08:55.834
Arrby, get me that shell!

08:55.835 --> 08:57.168
Arr-mazing!

08:57.170 --> 08:57.669
(Gasping)

08:57.670 --> 08:58.169
Arr-mazing!

08:58.171 --> 08:58.553
The shell?

08:58.554 --> 08:58.936
Arr-mazing!

08:58.939 --> 09:00.272
But it's too... uh, too
big for me to carry.

09:00.273 --> 09:01.606
Arr-mazing!

09:01.608 --> 09:02.107
SID:
<i> Aye-aye.</i>

09:02.108 --> 09:02.607
Arr-mazing!

09:02.609 --> 09:03.759
<i> Then I'll come down to</i>
<i> help you, matey.</i>

09:03.760 --> 09:04.910
Arr-mazing!

09:04.912 --> 09:05.928
You will, really?

09:05.929 --> 09:06.945
Arr-mazing!

09:06.947 --> 09:07.462
Cool!

09:07.463 --> 09:07.978
Arr-mazing!

09:07.981 --> 09:08.680
RYDER:
What was that, Arrby?

09:08.681 --> 09:09.380
Arr-mazing!

09:09.383 --> 09:10.833
Uh, really cool shell.

09:10.834 --> 09:12.284
Arr-mazing!

09:12.286 --> 09:12.918
Heh-heh.

09:12.919 --> 09:13.551
Arr-mazing!

09:13.554 --> 09:14.169
The ship's not moving.

09:14.170 --> 09:14.785
Arr-mazing!

09:14.788 --> 09:16.004
Now what's it doing?

09:16.005 --> 09:17.221
Arr-mazing!

09:17.224 --> 09:18.941
(Whirring)

09:18.942 --> 09:20.659
Arr-mazing!

09:22.529 --> 09:26.164
Ryder, that boat just
turned into a submarine.

09:26.166 --> 09:26.581
Really?

09:26.582 --> 09:26.997
Ryder, that boat just
turned into a submarine.

09:27.000 --> 09:27.382
Thanks, Chase.

09:27.383 --> 09:27.765
Ryder, that boat just
turned into a submarine.

09:27.768 --> 09:29.401
I'll keep an eye out for it.

09:29.402 --> 09:31.035
Ryder, that boat just
turned into a submarine.

09:31.038 --> 09:32.254
SID:
The perfect hiding spot.

09:32.255 --> 09:33.471
Ryder, that boat just
turned into a submarine.

09:33.473 --> 09:33.822
Hmm.

09:33.823 --> 09:34.172
Ryder, that boat just
turned into a submarine.

09:34.174 --> 09:36.141
Arrby, do we still have
that giant balloon we took?

09:36.142 --> 09:38.109
Ryder, that boat just
turned into a submarine.

09:38.111 --> 09:39.427
In the hold, Captain,
boss, Mr. Sid, sir.

09:39.428 --> 09:40.744
Ryder, that boat just
turned into a submarine.

09:40.747 --> 09:41.096
But why?

09:41.097 --> 09:41.446
Ryder, that boat just
turned into a submarine.

09:41.448 --> 09:42.864
Because it will be the
perfect distraction.

09:42.865 --> 09:44.281
Ryder, that boat just
turned into a submarine.

09:44.284 --> 09:46.017
Time to play Clear the Castle.

09:46.018 --> 09:47.751
Ryder, that boat just
turned into a submarine.

09:47.754 --> 09:48.069
Arr!

09:48.070 --> 09:48.385
Ryder, that boat just
turned into a submarine.

09:48.388 --> 09:49.504
Such a clever pirate I am!

09:49.505 --> 09:50.621
Ryder, that boat just
turned into a submarine.

09:50.624 --> 09:52.207
(Whirring)

09:52.208 --> 09:53.791
Ryder, that boat just
turned into a submarine.

09:53.794 --> 09:54.376
(Thumping)

09:54.377 --> 09:54.959
Ryder, that boat just
turned into a submarine.

09:54.962 --> 09:55.627
(Hissing)

09:55.628 --> 09:56.293
Ryder, that boat just
turned into a submarine.

09:56.296 --> 09:57.179
Did you hear that noise?

09:57.180 --> 09:58.063
Ryder, that boat just
turned into a submarine.

09:58.065 --> 09:58.864
I heard it, too.

09:58.865 --> 09:59.664
Ryder, that boat just
turned into a submarine.

09:59.666 --> 10:00.382
What was that?

10:00.383 --> 10:01.099
Ryder, that boat just
turned into a submarine.

10:01.101 --> 10:02.551
(Yipping)

10:02.552 --> 10:04.002
Ryder, that boat just
turned into a submarine.

10:04.004 --> 10:04.419
(Gasping)

10:04.420 --> 10:04.835
Ryder, that boat just
turned into a submarine.

10:04.838 --> 10:06.271
Is it a big sea spider?

10:06.272 --> 10:07.705
Ryder, that boat just
turned into a submarine.

10:07.708 --> 10:08.190
Whoa.

10:08.191 --> 10:08.673
Ryder, that boat just
turned into a submarine.

10:08.675 --> 10:09.291
We better check it out.

10:09.292 --> 10:09.908
Ryder, that boat just
turned into a submarine.

10:09.910 --> 10:10.425
Come on, pups.

10:10.426 --> 10:10.941
Ryder, that boat just
turned into a submarine.

10:10.944 --> 10:12.244
I'm staying behind you.

10:12.245 --> 10:13.545
Ryder, that boat just
turned into a submarine.

10:14.982 --> 10:17.849
CAP'N TURBOT:
What a unique-looking octopus.

10:17.851 --> 10:18.383
(Camera snapping)

10:18.384 --> 10:18.916
CAP'N TURBOT:
What a unique-looking octopus.

10:18.919 --> 10:20.902
Hey, Arrby, what do you think?

10:20.903 --> 10:22.886
CAP'N TURBOT:
What a unique-looking octopus.

10:22.889 --> 10:23.605
Arrby?

10:23.606 --> 10:24.322
CAP'N TURBOT:
What a unique-looking octopus.

10:24.324 --> 10:25.123
Coast is clear!

10:25.124 --> 10:25.923
CAP'N TURBOT:
What a unique-looking octopus.

10:25.926 --> 10:27.426
Ready, Captain,
boss, Mr. Sid, sir.

10:27.427 --> 10:28.927
CAP'N TURBOT:
What a unique-looking octopus.

10:28.929 --> 10:29.378
Arr!

10:31.547 --> 10:33.263

What a unique-looking octopus.

10:33.934 --> 10:40.772
¶

10:41.174 --> 10:43.908
Look. It's just a balloon.

10:47.848 --> 10:52.183
Hey, that must be the submarine
that Chase told me about.

10:52.185 --> 10:53.084
What's it doing down here?

10:53.085 --> 10:53.984
Hey, that must be the submarine
that Chase told me about.

10:53.987 --> 10:54.536
I have no idea.

10:54.537 --> 10:55.086
Hey, that must be the submarine
that Chase told me about.

10:55.088 --> 10:55.554
(Gasping)

10:55.555 --> 10:56.021
Hey, that must be the submarine
that Chase told me about.

10:56.023 --> 10:56.822
(Yipping)

10:56.823 --> 10:57.622
Hey, that must be the submarine
that Chase told me about.

10:57.624 --> 10:59.641
She's saying there's something
wrong with Puplantis.

10:59.642 --> 11:01.659
Hey, that must be the submarine
that Chase told me about.

11:01.662 --> 11:02.444
(Yipping)

11:02.445 --> 11:03.227
Hey, that must be the submarine
that Chase told me about.

11:03.230 --> 11:04.479
(Cracking and crumbling)

11:04.480 --> 11:05.729
Hey, that must be the submarine
that Chase told me about.

11:05.732 --> 11:06.831
What's happening to Puplantis?

11:06.832 --> 11:07.931
Hey, that must be the submarine
that Chase told me about.

11:07.934 --> 11:08.516
(All gasping)

11:08.517 --> 11:09.099
Hey, that must be the submarine
that Chase told me about.

11:09.102 --> 11:10.018
Oh, no!

11:10.019 --> 11:10.935
Hey, that must be the submarine
that Chase told me about.

11:10.937 --> 11:12.454
The magic Shell
of Puplantis is gone.

11:12.455 --> 11:13.972
Hey, that must be the submarine
that Chase told me about.

11:13.974 --> 11:15.407
(Yipping)

11:15.408 --> 11:16.841
Hey, that must be the submarine
that Chase told me about.

11:16.843 --> 11:17.559
What's happening to the pearls?

11:17.560 --> 11:18.276
Hey, that must be the submarine
that Chase told me about.

11:18.278 --> 11:19.411
Without the Shell
making new magic pearls

11:19.412 --> 11:20.545
Hey, that must be the submarine
that Chase told me about.

11:20.547 --> 11:21.646
to put in place of
the old, faded ones,

11:21.647 --> 11:22.746
Hey, that must be the submarine
that Chase told me about.

11:22.749 --> 11:23.682
the castle could collapse...

11:23.683 --> 11:24.616
Hey, that must be the submarine
that Chase told me about.

11:24.618 --> 11:25.767
then the whole of Puplantis!

11:25.768 --> 11:26.917
Hey, that must be the submarine
that Chase told me about.

11:26.920 --> 11:27.619
(Yipping)

11:27.620 --> 11:28.319
Hey, that must be the submarine
that Chase told me about.

11:28.321 --> 11:28.770
(Breaking and crumbling)

11:28.771 --> 11:29.220
Hey, that must be the submarine
that Chase told me about.

11:29.222 --> 11:30.956
Everyone, out
of the castle, now!

11:30.957 --> 11:32.691
Hey, that must be the submarine
that Chase told me about.

11:32.693 --> 11:34.209
(Barking and howling)

11:34.210 --> 11:35.726
Hey, that must be the submarine
that Chase told me about.

11:35.729 --> 11:37.713
(Breaking and crumbling)

11:37.714 --> 11:39.698
Hey, that must be the submarine
that Chase told me about.

11:40.033 --> 11:41.933
The castle is falling apart!

11:41.935 --> 11:43.885
It needs the pearls'
magic to fix it.

11:43.886 --> 11:45.836
The castle is falling apart!

11:45.839 --> 11:46.755
Hey... where did Arrby go?

11:46.756 --> 11:47.672
The castle is falling apart!

11:47.674 --> 11:49.324
First the Shell of Puplantis
disappears, and now Arrby?

11:49.325 --> 11:50.975
The castle is falling apart!

11:50.977 --> 11:52.727
I don't know how took the shell,
but that submarine taking off

11:52.728 --> 11:54.478
The castle is falling apart!

11:54.481 --> 11:55.363
might have something
to do with it.

11:55.364 --> 11:56.246
The castle is falling apart!

11:56.249 --> 11:57.615
Do you think Arrby went
with the sub?

11:57.616 --> 11:58.982
The castle is falling apart!

11:58.985 --> 11:59.584
I bet that balloon octopus

11:59.585 --> 12:00.184
The castle is falling apart!

12:00.187 --> 12:01.253
was a trick to get
us away from the castle.

12:01.254 --> 12:02.320
The castle is falling apart!

12:02.322 --> 12:04.172
And when we weren't looking,
Arrby took the shell.

12:04.173 --> 12:06.023
The castle is falling apart!

12:06.026 --> 12:06.525
I think you're right.

12:06.526 --> 12:07.025
The castle is falling apart!

12:07.027 --> 12:08.260
And someone in that
submarine was helping him.

12:08.261 --> 12:09.494
The castle is falling apart!

12:09.496 --> 12:09.978
(Crumbling)

12:09.979 --> 12:10.461
The castle is falling apart!

12:10.464 --> 12:10.996
(All gasping)

12:10.997 --> 12:11.529
The castle is falling apart!

12:11.531 --> 12:11.980
(Gasping)

12:11.981 --> 12:12.430
The castle is falling apart!

12:12.432 --> 12:12.881
Puplantis can't last

12:12.882 --> 12:13.331
The castle is falling apart!

12:13.333 --> 12:14.833
without that
precious pearl-producing shell.

12:14.834 --> 12:16.334
The castle is falling apart!

12:16.336 --> 12:16.718
Don't worry.

12:16.719 --> 12:17.101
The castle is falling apart!

12:17.104 --> 12:18.003
No palace is too big.

12:18.004 --> 12:18.903
The castle is falling apart!

12:18.905 --> 12:19.537
No pup is too small.

12:19.538 --> 12:20.170
The castle is falling apart!

12:20.173 --> 12:22.140
Sea Patrol...
to the beach tower!

12:22.141 --> 12:24.108
The castle is falling apart!

12:24.111 --> 12:25.027
PUPS:
Ryder needs us!

12:25.028 --> 12:25.944
The castle is falling apart!

12:25.946 --> 12:26.445
(Barking)

12:26.446 --> 12:26.945
The castle is falling apart!

12:26.947 --> 12:28.163
(Howling)

12:28.164 --> 12:29.380
The castle is falling apart!

12:34.054 --> 12:34.919
Sorry.

12:34.921 --> 12:36.404
It's hard to
run with a fish tail.

12:36.405 --> 12:37.888
Sorry.

12:40.293 --> 12:41.226
Whoa!

12:41.228 --> 12:41.576
(Crashing)

12:41.577 --> 12:41.925
Whoa!

12:41.928 --> 12:42.844
No more Mershall the merpup.

12:42.845 --> 12:43.761
Whoa!

12:43.764 --> 12:45.314
Now I'm just clumsy
old Marshall.

12:45.315 --> 12:46.865
Whoa!

12:46.867 --> 12:48.116
(All laughing)

12:48.117 --> 12:49.366
Whoa!

12:50.036 --> 12:56.007
¶

12:56.376 --> 13:00.078

13:01.097 --> 13:02.113
Sea Patrol ready for
action, Captain Ryder, sir.

13:02.115 --> 13:03.682
As you know, the Shell of
Puplantis was taken,

13:03.683 --> 13:05.250
Sea Patrol ready for
action, Captain Ryder, sir.

13:05.252 --> 13:06.852
and now the merpups'
home is falling apart.

13:06.853 --> 13:08.453
Sea Patrol ready for
action, Captain Ryder, sir.

13:08.455 --> 13:08.804
Oh, no!

13:08.805 --> 13:09.154

we can find the shell.

13:15.778 --> 13:17.495
Sea Patrol ready for

13:17.497 --> 13:18.146
Green means go.

Rubble on the double.

13:24.420 --> 13:25.603
Sea Patrol ready for

13:29.643 --> 13:30.409
This cap'n can do!

13:31.178 --> 13:32.344
While you three

13:33.513 --> 13:34.462

13:34.463 --> 13:35.412
Sea Patrol ready for
action, Captain Ryder, sir.

13:35.415 --> 13:36.681
and rush the Shell back
to Puplantis.

13:36.682 --> 13:37.948
Sea Patrol ready for

13:37.951 --> 13:39.000

A new pearl.

14:32.621 --> 14:33.036
(Gasping)

14:33.039 --> 14:34.556
Why, this Shell be the
finest bit of booty

14:34.557 --> 14:36.074

Stop here, Robo-Dog.

14:46.335 --> 14:47.217

14:50.891 --> 14:52.841
Rubble, Rocky, get
ready to launch.

14:52.842 --> 14:54.792
(Gasping)

14:55.562 --> 14:59.364
¶ Go, go, go, go ¶

14:59.366 --> 14:59.881
¶ Rubble ¶

14:59.882 --> 15:00.397
¶ Go, go, go, go ¶

15:00.400 --> 15:02.384
¶ Go, go, go, go, go ¶

15:02.385 --> 15:04.369
¶ Go, go, go, go ¶

15:04.838 --> 15:05.670
¶ Rocky ¶

15:05.672 --> 15:07.439
¶ Go, go, go, go, go, go ¶

15:07.440 --> 15:09.207
¶ Rocky ¶

15:09.209 --> 15:10.425
(Yipping)

15:10.426 --> 15:11.642
¶ Rocky ¶

15:12.212 --> 15:16.414
Now, to find that pirate sub, we
need to travel underwater.

15:16.416 --> 15:17.582
But we can't all fit in my sub.

15:17.583 --> 15:18.749
Now, to find that pirate sub, we
need to travel underwater.

15:18.752 --> 15:19.551
No, we can't.

15:19.552 --> 15:20.351
Now, to find that pirate sub, we
need to travel underwater.

15:20.353 --> 15:21.886
That's why we have...

15:21.887 --> 15:23.420
Now, to find that pirate sub, we
need to travel underwater.

15:23.857 --> 15:25.823
the Sub Patroller.

15:25.825 --> 15:26.524
(Pups shouting their enthusiasm)

15:26.525 --> 15:27.224
the Sub Patroller.

15:27.227 --> 15:28.994
But what if the sub
turns back into a ship

15:28.995 --> 15:30.762
the Sub Patroller.

15:30.764 --> 15:31.646
and comes above water?

15:31.647 --> 15:32.529
the Sub Patroller.

15:32.532 --> 15:33.064
Good point, Chase.

15:33.065 --> 15:33.597
the Sub Patroller.

15:33.600 --> 15:34.032
We should have someone

15:34.033 --> 15:34.465
the Sub Patroller.

15:34.467 --> 15:35.466
keep watch from
the Sea Patroller, too.

15:35.467 --> 15:36.466
the Sub Patroller.

15:36.469 --> 15:36.985
I'm still on duty.

15:36.986 --> 15:37.502
the Sub Patroller.

15:37.504 --> 15:37.969
I'll stay behind.

15:37.970 --> 15:38.435
the Sub Patroller.

15:38.438 --> 15:39.621
But you'll miss out
on the Sub Patroller, too.

15:39.622 --> 15:40.805
the Sub Patroller.

15:40.807 --> 15:42.424
I really want to
go with you, but nope.

15:42.425 --> 15:44.042
the Sub Patroller.

15:44.044 --> 15:44.776
It's my responsibility.

15:44.777 --> 15:45.509
the Sub Patroller.

15:45.512 --> 15:45.961
You guys go ahead.

15:45.962 --> 15:46.411
the Sub Patroller.

15:46.413 --> 15:48.029
(Other pups barking
and shouting)

15:48.030 --> 15:49.646
the Sub Patroller.

15:49.649 --> 15:51.349
(Whirring)

15:51.350 --> 15:53.050
the Sub Patroller.

15:54.788 --> 15:58.723
RYDER:
Sea Patrol is on a roll!

16:00.527 --> 16:01.426
ZUMA:
So fast.

16:01.428 --> 16:02.727
And that was just our
launch speed.

16:02.728 --> 16:04.027
ZUMA:
So fast.

16:04.030 --> 16:05.830
Hang on while we test the jets.

16:05.831 --> 16:07.631
ZUMA:
So fast.

16:10.537 --> 16:12.971
(Creaking)

16:14.407 --> 16:16.174
SID:
Eh, more pearls.

16:16.176 --> 16:16.625
I like it.

16:16.626 --> 16:17.075
SID:
Eh, more pearls.

16:17.077 --> 16:17.642
But the Shell keeps making them,

16:17.643 --> 16:18.208
SID:
Eh, more pearls.

16:18.211 --> 16:19.544
and the ship is getting heavier,
and we're sinking lower.

16:19.545 --> 16:20.878
SID:
Eh, more pearls.

16:20.880 --> 16:22.497
Can we please throw
some other stuff out?

16:22.498 --> 16:24.115
SID:
Eh, more pearls.

16:24.117 --> 16:24.532
(Laughing)

16:24.533 --> 16:24.948
SID:
Eh, more pearls.

16:24.951 --> 16:25.667
Throw away treasure?

16:25.668 --> 16:26.384
SID:
Eh, more pearls.

16:26.386 --> 16:27.252
You're so funny, Arrby.

16:27.253 --> 16:28.119
SID:
Eh, more pearls.

16:28.121 --> 16:28.920
Never!

16:28.921 --> 16:29.720
SID:
Eh, more pearls.

16:29.723 --> 16:30.889
Aw.

16:30.890 --> 16:32.056
SID:
Eh, more pearls.

16:33.059 --> 16:35.493
(Creaking)

16:38.365 --> 16:39.364
Rubble here, Ryder.

16:39.366 --> 16:41.199
The palace is looking
a little shaky.

16:41.200 --> 16:43.033
Rubble here, Ryder.

16:43.036 --> 16:43.518
Oops.

16:43.519 --> 16:44.001
Rubble here, Ryder.

16:44.004 --> 16:45.253
Make that a whole lot shaky.

16:45.254 --> 16:46.503
Rubble here, Ryder.

16:46.506 --> 16:47.272
But we're on it.

16:47.273 --> 16:48.039
Rubble here, Ryder.

16:48.041 --> 16:48.740
RYDER (ON RADIO):
<i> Thanks, Rubble.</i>

16:48.741 --> 16:49.440
Rubble here, Ryder.

16:49.442 --> 16:50.558
<i> We'll meet you there once</i>
<i> we find that pirate sub</i>

16:50.559 --> 16:51.675
Rubble here, Ryder.

16:51.678 --> 16:52.627
<i> and get that Shell back.</i>

16:52.628 --> 16:53.577
Rubble here, Ryder.

16:53.580 --> 16:54.279
(Barking)

16:54.280 --> 16:54.979
Rubble here, Ryder.

16:54.981 --> 16:55.697
That's a great idea.

16:55.698 --> 16:56.414
Rubble here, Ryder.

16:56.416 --> 16:57.499
She's off to help Ryder.

16:57.500 --> 16:58.583
Rubble here, Ryder.

16:58.585 --> 17:00.035
Cap'n Turbot, we need
some kind of pole

17:00.036 --> 17:01.486
Rubble here, Ryder.

17:01.488 --> 17:02.037
to prop up the palace.

17:02.038 --> 17:02.587
Rubble here, Ryder.

17:02.589 --> 17:04.422
I'll ask the merpups if
they can help you.

17:04.423 --> 17:06.256
Rubble here, Ryder.

17:06.259 --> 17:07.392
(Barking)

17:07.393 --> 17:08.526
Rubble here, Ryder.

17:08.528 --> 17:09.744
(Yipping)

17:09.745 --> 17:10.961
Rubble here, Ryder.

17:12.232 --> 17:15.466
ROCKY:
I can use that
mast from the old ship.

17:15.468 --> 17:16.234
Don't lose it.

17:16.235 --> 17:17.001
ROCKY:
I can use that
mast from the old ship.

17:17.003 --> 17:18.219
Reuse it!

17:18.220 --> 17:19.436
ROCKY:
I can use that
mast from the old ship.

17:20.106 --> 17:26.944
¶

17:27.647 --> 17:28.379
Nice.

17:28.381 --> 17:29.847
That should hold it for now.

17:29.848 --> 17:31.314
Nice.

17:31.951 --> 17:33.818
(Yipping)

17:33.820 --> 17:34.819
Hey, it's Mama Merpup.

17:34.820 --> 17:35.819
(Yipping)

17:35.822 --> 17:36.521
I guess she wants to help, too.

17:36.522 --> 17:37.221
(Yipping)

17:37.223 --> 17:39.173
Ryder, there's something on
the sonar moving fast.

17:39.174 --> 17:41.124
(Yipping)

17:41.127 --> 17:41.476
(Beeping)

17:41.477 --> 17:41.826
(Yipping)

17:41.828 --> 17:43.011
It could be the pirate sub.

17:43.012 --> 17:44.195
(Yipping)

17:44.197 --> 17:44.863
Hang on, pups.

17:44.864 --> 17:45.530
(Yipping)

17:45.532 --> 17:46.631
Full speed ahead.

17:46.632 --> 17:47.731
(Yipping)

17:52.572 --> 17:53.805
SKYE:
Look, look!

17:53.807 --> 17:54.289
The pirate sub!

17:54.290 --> 17:54.772
SKYE:
Look, look!

17:54.774 --> 17:55.790
Arr, we're being followed.

17:55.791 --> 17:56.807
SKYE:
Look, look!

17:56.810 --> 17:57.342
Hold on.

17:57.343 --> 17:57.875
SKYE:
Look, look!

17:57.877 --> 17:58.192
Arr!

17:58.193 --> 17:58.508
SKYE:
Look, look!

17:58.511 --> 17:59.594
Where's the sub going now?

17:59.595 --> 18:00.678
SKYE:
Look, look!

18:00.680 --> 18:01.963
I'll follow them.

18:01.964 --> 18:03.247
SKYE:
Look, look!

18:05.085 --> 18:09.353
That sub's sticking to me
like a bad barnacle.

18:11.558 --> 18:13.191
Captain, boss, Mr. Sid, sir,

18:13.193 --> 18:14.326
all those pearls
are slowing us down.

18:14.327 --> 18:15.460
Captain, boss, Mr. Sid, sir,

18:15.462 --> 18:17.479
If we can't be speedy,
we'll be sneaky.

18:17.480 --> 18:19.497
Captain, boss, Mr. Sid, sir,

18:19.499 --> 18:20.799
Let's hide in that cove!

18:20.800 --> 18:22.100
Captain, boss, Mr. Sid, sir,

18:27.740 --> 18:29.040
(Clanking)

18:29.042 --> 18:29.474
That way!

18:29.475 --> 18:29.907
(Clanking)

18:29.909 --> 18:30.541
I heard something!

18:30.542 --> 18:31.174
(Clanking)

18:31.177 --> 18:31.959
Sea Patroller lights!

18:31.960 --> 18:32.742
(Clanking)

18:32.745 --> 18:33.828
(Barking)

18:33.829 --> 18:34.912
(Clanking)

18:34.914 --> 18:36.347
(Whirring)

18:36.348 --> 18:37.781
(Clanking)

18:37.784 --> 18:38.133
Yes!

18:38.134 --> 18:38.483
(Clanking)

18:38.485 --> 18:39.301
Ryder, I think I found them.

18:39.302 --> 18:40.118
(Clanking)

18:40.120 --> 18:41.236
RYDER (ON RADIO):
<i> That's great, Chase.</i>

18:41.237 --> 18:42.353
(Clanking)

18:42.355 --> 18:42.837
Good work.

18:42.838 --> 18:43.320
(Clanking)

18:43.323 --> 18:43.955
We're on our way.

18:43.956 --> 18:44.588
(Clanking)

18:44.591 --> 18:45.807
Keep an eye on it.

18:45.808 --> 18:47.024
(Clanking)

18:47.026 --> 18:47.825
(Groaning)

18:47.826 --> 18:48.625
(Clanking)

18:48.628 --> 18:50.078
Those pearls are
scuttling our sub!

18:50.079 --> 18:51.529
(Clanking)

18:51.531 --> 18:52.831
Stop making pearls!

18:52.832 --> 18:54.132
(Clanking)

18:58.371 --> 18:59.971
Arr!

18:59.973 --> 19:01.072
-By?

19:01.073 --> 19:02.172
Arr!

19:03.943 --> 19:06.344
There goes another pillar!

19:06.346 --> 19:07.929
Let's keep fixing.

19:07.930 --> 19:09.513
There goes another pillar!

19:09.516 --> 19:10.065
Help!

19:10.066 --> 19:10.615
There goes another pillar!

19:10.617 --> 19:11.383
Arr!

19:11.384 --> 19:12.150
There goes another pillar!

19:13.786 --> 19:14.685
There they are!

19:14.687 --> 19:15.853
Those are the pups
who rescued me.

19:15.854 --> 19:17.020
There they are!

19:17.023 --> 19:17.505
<i> Ahoy there.</i>

19:17.506 --> 19:17.988
There they are!

19:17.991 --> 19:19.040
Looks like you need some help.

19:19.041 --> 19:20.090
There they are!

19:20.093 --> 19:20.492
<i> Yeah.</i>

19:20.493 --> 19:20.892
There they are!

19:20.894 --> 19:22.027
<i> It's me, Arrby, and</i>
<i> Sid Swashbuckle.</i>

19:22.028 --> 19:23.161
There they are!

19:23.163 --> 19:23.678
<i> Please help us.</i>

19:23.679 --> 19:24.194
There they are!

19:24.197 --> 19:24.863
<i> We need help!</i>

19:24.864 --> 19:25.530
There they are!

19:25.532 --> 19:25.930
<i> Need it!</i>

19:25.931 --> 19:26.329
There they are!

19:26.332 --> 19:26.798
We'll pull you out.

19:26.799 --> 19:27.265
There they are!

19:27.267 --> 19:28.500
And after, you give
back that Shell.

19:28.501 --> 19:29.734
There they are!

19:29.736 --> 19:30.552
It belongs to the merpups.

19:30.553 --> 19:31.369
There they are!

19:31.371 --> 19:32.170
<i> Anything, anything!</i>

19:32.171 --> 19:32.970
There they are!

19:32.972 --> 19:35.106
Zuma, activate the claws and
we'll pull out that sub.

19:35.107 --> 19:37.241
There they are!

19:37.243 --> 19:38.693
Aye-aye, Cap'n Ryder!

19:38.694 --> 19:40.144
There they are!

19:40.146 --> 19:41.362
(Whirring)

19:41.363 --> 19:42.579
There they are!

19:45.318 --> 19:47.752
Let's pull back.

19:47.754 --> 19:48.970
(Groaning)

19:48.971 --> 19:50.187
Let's pull back.

19:52.525 --> 19:53.891
There you go.

19:53.893 --> 19:55.076
(Crunching)

19:55.077 --> 19:56.260
There you go.

19:56.262 --> 19:58.146
On second, thought, I--
I need my stuff.

19:58.147 --> 20:00.031
There you go.

20:00.033 --> 20:00.415
Let's go!

20:00.416 --> 20:00.798
There you go.

20:00.800 --> 20:02.216
SKYE:
Ooh, that tricky pirate Sid!

20:02.217 --> 20:03.633
There you go.

20:03.636 --> 20:04.352
He's trying to get away!

20:04.353 --> 20:05.069
There you go.

20:05.071 --> 20:06.621
We've got to catch him!

20:06.622 --> 20:08.172
There you go.

20:08.174 --> 20:08.589
RYDER:
Oh, no!

20:08.590 --> 20:09.005
There you go.

20:09.008 --> 20:09.524
We're caught in these rocks!

20:09.525 --> 20:10.041
There you go.

20:10.043 --> 20:10.875
But the pirate sub's
getting away

20:10.876 --> 20:11.708
There you go.

20:11.711 --> 20:12.593
with the Shell of Puplantis!

20:12.594 --> 20:13.476
There you go.

20:13.479 --> 20:14.912
Good thing we have one more pup.

20:14.913 --> 20:16.346
There you go.

20:16.349 --> 20:18.232
Chase, we freed Sid and
Arrby, but now we're stuck.

20:18.233 --> 20:20.116
There you go.

20:20.119 --> 20:20.685
And they're getting away.

20:20.686 --> 20:21.252
There you go.

20:21.254 --> 20:23.054
I need you to use your winch
and open that pirate ship hatch

20:23.055 --> 20:24.855
There you go.

20:24.857 --> 20:25.673
to get the shell back.

20:25.674 --> 20:26.490
There you go.

20:26.492 --> 20:28.075

(Clanking)

20:50.283 --> 20:51.382
Hang tight, pups.

20:51.384 --> 20:53.368
We're moving back, then
thrusting forward.

20:53.369 --> 20:55.353
Hang tight, pups.

quick, slick getaway.

What?

21:13.255 --> 21:13.604

How am I going
to get the shell now?

22:00.386 --> 22:02.870
And that sleek sub is bringing
