(Fredrik)
Previously on<i>Million Dollar</i>
<i>Listing New York...</i>

00:04.838 --> 00:05.905
I need to stage it.

00:05.939 --> 00:07.607
Everything has to go,
including you.

00:07.640 --> 00:09.042
When I'm done with this,

00:09.075 --> 00:10.877
it'll make the White House
look like Applebee's.

00:14.914 --> 00:16.049
Now I'm [bleep].

00:16.082 --> 00:18.184
Guys, I'm going
to give you full ask.

00:18.218 --> 00:19.519
I have to throw a party.

00:19.552 --> 00:21.187
We need to invite, like,
every broker in New York City,

00:21.221 --> 00:22.389
even someone like Luis.

00:22.422 --> 00:23.923
What is this?
Are you guys working together?

00:23.957 --> 00:25.492
Maybe we are.

00:25.525 --> 00:27.460
Of course these two would have
eventually worked together.

00:28.862 --> 00:30.497
Congratulations.
Here's your next project.

00:30.530 --> 00:32.999
We have seven others
that are under construction.

00:33.033 --> 00:35.535
Now I could get Emilia a ring
even bigger than Yvonne's.

00:35.568 --> 00:37.103
I love you and Emelia.

00:41.641 --> 00:46.846
(Ryan)
My motto is "Expansion always,
in all ways."

00:46.880 --> 00:49.149
(Luis)
New York City,
it's the most exciting city

00:49.182 --> 00:51.117
for real estate,
and that's why I'm here.

00:51.151 --> 00:53.253
(Fredrik)
I'm the closer
and the listing machine.

00:53.286 --> 00:56.189
What makes me better is that
I work harder than anyone else.

00:56.222 --> 00:57.390
Weeeeee!

00:57.424 --> 00:59.059
We're friends now, right?

00:59.092 --> 01:01.461
I don't need him,
and you don't either.

01:01.494 --> 01:03.263
This will never end.

01:12.172 --> 01:14.841
(Fredrik)
Alberto, can you take me
to Time Warner?

01:14.874 --> 01:16.476
Whaa.

01:16.509 --> 01:18.345
The Time Warner building
is, like,

01:18.378 --> 01:19.779
the second most expensive
building

01:19.813 --> 01:21.614
in the Western hemisphere.

01:21.648 --> 01:24.117
This building is the glass tower

01:24.150 --> 01:26.920
looking over Central Park
on one side,

01:26.953 --> 01:29.389
Hudson River sunsets
on the other.

01:29.422 --> 01:31.758
This is the reason
I worked for 12 years

01:31.791 --> 01:34.594
to become number one, so you can
actually pick up the phone

01:34.627 --> 01:36.162
and receive that call.

01:36.196 --> 01:38.365
- Hi.
- Hi, how are you?

01:38.398 --> 01:39.566
I'm good.
I'm Fredrik.

01:39.599 --> 01:40.967
Come on in.
Come on in.

01:41.001 --> 01:42.102
- What a cute little--
- This is Louis.

01:42.135 --> 01:43.703
- Luis?
- Louis.

01:45.105 --> 01:46.506
Oh, Louis Vuitton.

01:46.539 --> 01:49.809
Oh. My. God.

01:49.843 --> 01:55.148
All I see is this piece of glass
framing perfection.

02:07.394 --> 02:09.529
(Cheryl)
I bought two units,
and I combined them.

02:09.562 --> 02:10.797
(Fredrik)
And you ripped everything out.

02:10.830 --> 02:12.065
This is your finishes.

02:12.065 --> 02:13.199
Started all over, yeah.

02:13.233 --> 02:15.101
Took four years,
but it's finally finished.

02:16.736 --> 02:19.072
(Fredrik)
I mean, this apartment
is out of this world.

02:19.072 --> 02:22.142
Every step is marble.

02:22.175 --> 02:24.944
Cheryl ripped out everything
and put in her own finishes--

02:24.978 --> 02:30.483
the floors, the columns,
the kitchen, the bathroom.

02:30.517 --> 02:32.118
Wow.

02:32.152 --> 02:33.787
That's the biggest showerhead
I've ever seen in my life.

02:33.820 --> 02:35.088
(Cheryl)
Have you ever seen
a showerhead like that?

02:35.121 --> 02:36.356
- Can I step in?
- Sure.

02:36.389 --> 02:37.590
Oh, my God.

02:38.992 --> 02:41.294
And the views.

02:41.327 --> 02:43.363
(Cheryl)
So this is the master.

02:43.396 --> 02:45.832
Oh, my God.

02:48.735 --> 02:50.303
A girl's dream closet.

02:50.337 --> 02:52.238
This is bigger than most
people's apartments in New York.

02:52.272 --> 02:53.640
I actually had this done

02:53.673 --> 02:55.508
after I saw the movie
<i>Sex and the City.</i>

02:55.542 --> 02:56.876
Do you have a Mr. Big
in your life?

02:56.910 --> 02:58.178
I do.

02:58.211 --> 02:59.612
I have a Mr. Big too.

03:01.581 --> 03:03.216
(Fredrik)
It's beautiful. Congrats.

03:03.249 --> 03:04.784
- Thank you.
- It is stunning.

03:04.818 --> 03:06.553
So why are you moving?

03:06.586 --> 03:08.855
I'm moving because I have
a ten-year-old son,

03:08.888 --> 03:09.923
and I just wanted to be

03:09.956 --> 03:11.424
in a more family-oriented
building.

03:11.458 --> 03:12.759
- That makes sense.
- Yeah.

03:12.792 --> 03:14.194
So let's talk about price.

03:14.227 --> 03:16.896
The comps would say,
on the high side,

03:16.930 --> 03:18.531
6,000 a foot.

03:18.565 --> 03:20.066
But you ripped
everything out.

03:20.100 --> 03:22.602
You combined four years,
millions of dollars.

03:22.635 --> 03:26.439
So I'm willing to go to,
like, 8,000 a foot,

03:26.473 --> 03:30.076
which is, like,
$28, $29 million.

03:31.277 --> 03:32.846
Excuse me?

03:32.879 --> 03:34.481
Quite frankly,
I find your number

03:34.514 --> 03:36.316
a little bit insulting.

03:36.349 --> 03:39.853
I thought I could get...
50.

03:39.886 --> 03:41.554
- Five zero?
- Correct.

03:41.588 --> 03:43.323
That's just insane.

03:43.356 --> 03:45.625
It's actually like--
it's really crazy.

03:45.658 --> 03:46.926
I keep, like, looking
into her eyes,

03:46.960 --> 03:49.162
and she actually believes
that this apartment

03:49.195 --> 03:53.867
is worth $50 million,
which is $15,000 a foot,

03:53.900 --> 03:56.469
where nothing ever sold
over $10,000 in this town.

03:56.503 --> 03:58.104
I just think
there's nothing like it.

03:58.104 --> 04:00.440
With all due respect,
it's not the highest floor,

04:00.473 --> 04:01.941
and it doesn't allow
for space.

04:02.042 --> 04:04.110
I mean, for anything over 30,

04:04.144 --> 04:06.746
you would need, like,
a big terrace.

04:06.780 --> 04:08.381
Well, it's not gonna be 20.

04:08.415 --> 04:10.350
I never said 20.
I said the high 20s.

04:11.718 --> 04:13.586
36.

04:13.620 --> 04:15.822
No.

04:15.855 --> 04:18.291
This unit asks for it,
and we'll get it.

04:18.324 --> 04:19.759
[exhales]

04:19.793 --> 04:22.662
I mean, we got to be
under 10,000 a foot.

04:22.696 --> 04:25.065
I always go by the comps,

04:25.065 --> 04:27.967
but this is
one of those buildings

04:28.068 --> 04:33.073
where someone internationally
could just come in

04:33.106 --> 04:35.475
and scoop something up,
overpriced or not.

04:35.508 --> 04:38.178
Screw the comps in this case.

04:38.211 --> 04:43.516
$34,975,000.
Mm!

04:46.186 --> 04:49.155
Yeah, I'm--
I think I'm good with that.

04:49.189 --> 04:50.657
- Agreed?
- Agreed.

04:50.690 --> 04:54.094
I mean, this is incredible.

04:54.094 --> 04:56.596
I have a $35 million
new listing in Time Warner,

04:56.629 --> 04:59.366
but...I just want to, like,
close my eyes for that price.

04:59.399 --> 05:00.433
That price is high.

05:00.467 --> 05:01.701
- Bye, guys.
- See you later.

05:01.735 --> 05:04.237
- Bye, Luis.
- Louis.

05:11.911 --> 05:14.047
(man)
All right.

05:14.047 --> 05:15.382
- Whoo!
- [laughs]

05:15.415 --> 05:16.783
(Luis)
My current listing
on 92 Laight Street

05:16.816 --> 05:20.286
has been...a ride.

05:20.320 --> 05:21.654
Angel.

05:21.688 --> 05:23.056
(Luis)
My agreement with the seller,
Angel,

05:23.056 --> 05:25.425
was that I will take on
the listing

05:25.458 --> 05:28.294
only if he agreed
to move out of his apartment.

05:28.328 --> 05:31.064
Adam, I have a client that needs
an immediate move-in.

05:31.064 --> 05:32.432
This is sort of an emergency.

05:32.465 --> 05:34.401
Angel was not happy,
but I got him out,

05:34.434 --> 05:37.070
and now that he's gone,
I have staged the apartment,

05:37.070 --> 05:40.106
and it looks...amazing.

05:41.641 --> 05:43.276
Angel's apartment
is facing the water,

05:43.309 --> 05:45.278
and it's very peaceful.

05:45.311 --> 05:47.614
I wanted something
that feels very open,

05:47.647 --> 05:50.684
that feels very breezy,
that blends with the water.

05:50.717 --> 05:53.219
Luis Ortiz.
Good to see you.

05:53.253 --> 05:54.354
Pleasure.
You look amazing.

05:54.387 --> 05:55.922
Welcome, welcome.
Nice to meet you.

05:55.955 --> 05:57.157
Pleasure.
Nice to see you.

05:57.190 --> 05:58.158
For those of you,
if you don't know,

05:58.191 --> 05:59.526
let me just give you
the breakdown.

05:59.559 --> 06:01.628
It's 2,000 square feet,
3 bedroom, 3 bathrooms.

06:01.661 --> 06:04.330
We're elevated about 150 feet
from the West Side Highway,

06:04.364 --> 06:06.166
so you'll never either
see it or hear it.

06:06.199 --> 06:08.501
This is something that
I think it's amazing.

06:08.535 --> 06:10.103
Now, is this beautiful
or what?

06:10.136 --> 06:12.172
This is as loud
as it's going to get.

06:12.205 --> 06:13.440
This is quiet Tribeca,

06:13.473 --> 06:14.908
and that's why people choose
to be here.

06:17.143 --> 06:18.345
Thank you so much.

06:18.378 --> 06:20.547
Turnout is amazing.
Everybody's happy.

06:20.580 --> 06:22.248
I'm happy.
Great start.

06:22.282 --> 06:24.184
We've put a lot of work
into this apartment.

06:26.086 --> 06:27.487
Nothing personal.

06:27.520 --> 06:28.855
I did not just put furniture
in there.

06:28.888 --> 06:29.923
I changed everything.

06:29.956 --> 06:32.926
I put light fixtures,
shades, paint.

06:32.959 --> 06:34.394
I gave this apartment life.

06:37.664 --> 06:39.666
Based on their reaction,
I have the feeling

06:39.699 --> 06:41.634
I'm going to sell this place
very fast.

06:41.668 --> 06:43.136
How many units total
in the building?

06:43.169 --> 06:44.671
So it's a total
of 68 units,

06:44.704 --> 06:46.606
and this side, the ones
that are facing the water,

06:46.639 --> 06:48.742
have combined a lot of units,
so that takes you down

06:48.775 --> 06:49.809
to about, I don't know,

06:49.843 --> 06:51.644
anywhere from 55
to 60 units total?

06:51.678 --> 06:53.747
Are those
your real eye color?

06:53.780 --> 06:55.148
No, I wear contacts.

06:55.181 --> 06:56.449
They look beautiful
either way.

06:56.483 --> 06:57.684
Thank you.

06:57.717 --> 06:59.119
(Luis)
Right now,
my commitment to Angel,

06:59.152 --> 07:00.220
it's my number one priority.

07:00.253 --> 07:01.921
- Where are you from?
- Taiwan.

07:02.022 --> 07:03.023
Taiwan.

07:03.023 --> 07:06.059
Number one, remember,
no distractions.

07:06.092 --> 07:07.761
All right, let me show you
the other bedrooms.

07:07.794 --> 07:10.397
5.1, great price.

07:10.430 --> 07:12.799
There is no negotiation,
actually.

07:12.832 --> 07:14.668
Ah, for you?

07:16.069 --> 07:18.138
Because you have
beautiful eyes?

07:18.171 --> 07:21.207
Everything works on me.
I'm very easy.

07:21.241 --> 07:23.410
Extremely easy,
too easy.

07:25.311 --> 07:26.913
[laughs]

07:26.946 --> 07:28.248
Focus.
Selling.

07:28.281 --> 07:30.050
Number one priority,
Angel.

07:30.050 --> 07:31.451
Pleasure, guys.

07:38.124 --> 07:41.094
My new client
is a very important client.

07:41.127 --> 07:43.630
Hey, it's Ryan.
I'm on my way.

07:43.663 --> 07:46.599
Maybe the most important client
of my life.

07:46.633 --> 07:49.436
Tribeca is kind of two-faced.

07:49.469 --> 07:51.638
It's all business
in the morning,

07:51.671 --> 07:53.606
and it's all party at night.

07:53.640 --> 07:56.943
So it's--it's kind of like
the mullet of New York:

07:56.976 --> 08:00.080
business in front,
party in the back.

08:00.113 --> 08:02.115
Hey, what are you doing here?

08:02.148 --> 08:03.316
Is your dad here?

08:03.350 --> 08:04.351
Yes.

08:04.384 --> 08:05.352
Over there.

08:05.385 --> 08:06.619
(Ryan)
Hello.

08:06.653 --> 08:08.488
I've worked for Eddie
for nearly six years.

08:08.521 --> 08:10.256
He is my boss.

08:10.290 --> 08:11.491
We've got another project.

08:11.524 --> 08:13.460
Don't walk back in the office
without the listing.

08:13.493 --> 08:15.228
(Ryan)
He's a scary guy.

08:15.261 --> 08:17.464
Eddie is the owner
of Nest Seekers,

08:17.497 --> 08:19.466
which means
he's incredibly busy,

08:19.499 --> 08:22.602
so he has to hire a broker
just like everybody else.

08:22.635 --> 08:25.405
And who does he hire
but the best.

08:27.240 --> 08:29.509
You hang out over there.

08:34.047 --> 08:37.484
This little thing here,
I see as a garden.

08:37.517 --> 08:39.085
This is crazy.

08:45.525 --> 08:47.627
What I love about this apartment

08:47.660 --> 08:52.399
is that because it was combined,
it's got a huge, open layout.

08:52.432 --> 08:54.501
And you can see sky
from here to here,

08:54.534 --> 08:55.669
which I think is pretty key.

08:55.702 --> 08:57.604
Are you giving me
the real estate speech

08:57.637 --> 08:58.672
and all that stuff?

08:58.705 --> 09:00.507
- That's what I--
- Yeah.

09:00.540 --> 09:01.775
That's what I do.

09:01.808 --> 09:04.244
Right. That's what
I taught you how to do.

09:04.277 --> 09:06.780
(Ryan)
Dealing with Eddie as a seller

09:06.813 --> 09:10.617
is kind of like the Karate Kid
fighting Mr. Miyagi.

09:10.650 --> 09:16.322
Like, he knows where
I'm gonna wax on or wax off.

09:16.356 --> 09:17.457
He sees it coming.

09:17.490 --> 09:20.060
So what do you want me
to sell it for?

09:20.093 --> 09:23.430
Well, I was thinking...

09:23.463 --> 09:26.533
for a modest 5.

09:26.566 --> 09:28.935
Wha--

09:29.035 --> 09:31.071
Um, you know, like,
when I used to call you

09:31.104 --> 09:33.173
about these really, really
difficult sellers?

09:33.206 --> 09:34.274
Yes.

09:34.307 --> 09:36.643
Who am I gonna call now
about you?

09:38.111 --> 09:39.713
The average price
per square foot

09:39.746 --> 09:42.716
for new condos in Tribeca
is just over $2,000.

09:42.749 --> 09:45.218
At $5 million,

09:45.251 --> 09:48.855
Eddie is asking
over $2,600 per square foot.

09:48.888 --> 09:50.824
That is not happening.

09:50.857 --> 09:53.059
Are you saying that I don't know
how much this place is worth?

09:53.059 --> 09:55.729
I think you are
a little emotionally attached.

09:55.762 --> 09:57.230
So what do you think
it's worth?

09:57.263 --> 09:58.465
How much
do you think it's worth?

09:58.498 --> 10:00.166
$100.

10:00.200 --> 10:01.167
You know what?

10:01.201 --> 10:02.402
It's about starting low,
I think,

10:02.435 --> 10:03.570
and then bidding the price up.

10:06.573 --> 10:09.676
Honestly, you're looking, like,
in the 3s, but I can--

10:09.709 --> 10:10.744
Now you're insulting me.

10:10.777 --> 10:12.212
I'm not insulting you.

10:12.245 --> 10:15.115
We can maybe meet low 4s?

10:15.148 --> 10:16.716
No.

10:16.750 --> 10:17.851
Okay, but 5 is too much.

10:23.156 --> 10:24.224
(Eddie)
What?

10:24.257 --> 10:26.226
He's smart.
He's smart.

10:26.259 --> 10:28.495
I think 4 1/2 might be doable.

10:31.898 --> 10:34.401
[drumroll]

10:34.434 --> 10:36.002
[cymbals crash]

10:36.036 --> 10:38.238
Okay, let's give it a shot

10:38.271 --> 10:40.040
- and see what happens.
- Okay. Deal.

10:40.073 --> 10:43.076
It sort of feels like I just
made a deal with the devil.

10:43.109 --> 10:46.079
Except the devil is my boss,

10:46.112 --> 10:49.249
so I guess I'll just
have to live with it.

10:49.282 --> 10:50.984
So, listen, I think we do
photos, get the floor plan--

10:51.017 --> 10:53.253
Hold on a minute.

10:53.286 --> 10:55.455
You have more than just
selling the apartment

10:55.488 --> 10:58.158
to worry about.

10:58.191 --> 10:59.626
What are you talking about?

11:02.262 --> 11:04.531
[speaking Chinese]

11:04.564 --> 11:05.799
Don't you think
that most of them

11:05.832 --> 11:08.068
are going to speak English
anyway?

11:08.068 --> 11:09.736
I'm not a patient person,
Luis.

11:09.769 --> 11:10.870
I need some results.

11:10.904 --> 11:11.905
Fine.
You're leaving?

11:11.938 --> 11:13.073
Okay.

11:13.073 --> 11:14.874
What just happened?

11:22.115 --> 11:25.919
(Eddie)
You have more than just selling
the apartment to worry about.

11:25.952 --> 11:28.521
(Ryan)
You want me to paint
your apartment too?

11:28.555 --> 11:29.656
Or what are you
needing me to do?

11:29.689 --> 11:31.725
Well, about a year ago,

11:31.758 --> 11:34.861
we bought
this massive art collection,

11:34.894 --> 11:37.764
about 400 pieces,
this one artist.

11:37.797 --> 11:42.469
I would like you to promote
and sell this art.

11:42.502 --> 11:43.837
Are you kidding?

11:43.870 --> 11:44.838
No, I'm not kidding.

11:44.871 --> 11:46.706
Oh, my God.

11:46.740 --> 11:50.210
Is Eddie, like, insane?

11:50.243 --> 11:51.945
We've been watching

11:51.978 --> 11:55.615
all of that social media work
that you've been doing.

11:55.648 --> 11:57.384
I'm not an art dealer, though.
I mean, I--

11:57.417 --> 11:59.619
But you weren't
a real estate agent either

11:59.652 --> 12:01.054
a couple years ago.

12:01.054 --> 12:02.622
You didn't know anything.

12:02.655 --> 12:04.157
You didn't know the difference
between Broadway

12:04.190 --> 12:05.158
and West Broadway.

12:05.191 --> 12:06.659
I--that was that one time.

12:06.693 --> 12:07.927
- Yeah.
- They have the same name.

12:07.961 --> 12:11.197
Right. Look, this collection
is very important to me.

12:11.231 --> 12:13.066
Is this a contingency
for the listing?

12:13.066 --> 12:14.134
Of course.

12:14.167 --> 12:15.201
Hold on one second.

12:15.235 --> 12:17.637
I'm--my chest hurts.
Okay.

12:17.671 --> 12:18.638
How much is this art
even worth?

12:18.672 --> 12:20.740
I don't know.

12:20.774 --> 12:23.076
(Ryan)
I'm trained to be able
to look at an apartment,

12:23.109 --> 12:25.645
and I can tell you
what it's worth like that.

12:25.679 --> 12:29.349
I can't really look at art
and tell you what it's worth,

12:29.382 --> 12:30.583
because I just don't know
the business.

12:30.617 --> 12:31.584
Like, I don't understand.

12:31.618 --> 12:33.086
What's my advertising budget?

12:33.086 --> 12:35.321
Unlimited.

12:35.355 --> 12:37.424
As long as it's not more than,
like,

12:37.457 --> 12:38.591
1,000 bucks or something.

12:40.760 --> 12:41.961
- I'll see ya.
- See ya.

12:41.995 --> 12:43.930
(Ryan)
Oh, my God.

12:49.102 --> 12:50.503
Mr. Angel.

12:50.537 --> 12:52.238
- How are you?
- How are you, sir?

12:52.272 --> 12:53.640
(Luis)
One thing
that's very important to me,

12:53.673 --> 12:55.675
it's my ability to follow up.

12:55.709 --> 12:57.344
<i>- Salud.</i>
<i>- Salud.</i>

12:57.377 --> 12:59.012
Doesn't matter if there's
good news or bad news.

12:59.112 --> 13:00.880
I want to make sure that
my client's always informed

13:00.914 --> 13:02.082
as to what's happening.

13:02.115 --> 13:03.450
What do you got?

13:03.483 --> 13:04.617
The open house was great.

13:04.651 --> 13:06.052
We have no offers yet.

13:06.052 --> 13:07.420
No offers?

13:07.454 --> 13:09.055
No offers yet, but, you know,
let's be patient.

13:09.055 --> 13:10.824
It's only been about a week.

13:10.857 --> 13:12.859
It's actually gonna be
two weeks tomorrow.

13:15.128 --> 13:17.130
You put me in a place
where it's okay

13:17.163 --> 13:18.398
but it's not my style.

13:18.431 --> 13:19.899
- I know.
- I need to get out of there.

13:19.933 --> 13:21.067
And we need
to sell this quick.

13:21.067 --> 13:22.335
I can't continue
this way.

13:22.369 --> 13:25.338
We priced Angel's apartment
quite aggressively,

13:25.372 --> 13:27.674
not as high as he wanted
but not cheap.

13:27.707 --> 13:29.976
- 5.5.
- That's too high.

13:30.076 --> 13:31.678
I'm thinking 5.1.

13:31.711 --> 13:34.748
$5.1 million is twice as much
as Angel paid

13:34.781 --> 13:36.182
for this apartment
ten years ago.

13:36.216 --> 13:39.619
But 5.1 million,
it's a tricky number.

13:39.652 --> 13:41.087
Buyers have limits.

13:41.087 --> 13:42.655
There's a price that they
don't want to go over.

13:42.689 --> 13:45.091
At 5.1, anybody that has decided

13:45.091 --> 13:47.927
that they don't want to go
over 5 million, we're missing.

13:47.961 --> 13:50.096
You realize I'm not
a patient person, Luis.

13:50.130 --> 13:52.665
I need some results.

13:55.335 --> 13:57.303
Take care.

13:57.337 --> 13:59.172
Okay.

14:04.744 --> 14:07.113
[stammering]

14:09.616 --> 14:12.886
What just happened?

14:12.919 --> 14:15.055
All right, that went well.

14:21.094 --> 14:24.431
[doorbell rings]

14:24.464 --> 14:26.132
- Hi.
- Hi, how are you?

14:26.166 --> 14:27.867
- Good. Ryan.
- Danielle.

14:27.901 --> 14:29.436
(Ryan)
After I left Eddie,
I did some homework,

14:29.469 --> 14:31.071
and I found out
that all of the art

14:31.071 --> 14:34.207
was actually done by a guy
named Louis Kunsch.

14:34.240 --> 14:35.909
- Thank you for coming...
- No problem.

14:35.942 --> 14:37.277
To the Louis Kunsch
art gallery.

14:37.310 --> 14:38.545
[laughs]

14:38.578 --> 14:40.714
But there's not that much info
on the guy,

14:40.747 --> 14:42.515
so I called in an appraiser

14:42.549 --> 14:45.085
to tell me
exactly how much it's worth.

14:45.118 --> 14:46.653
Do you know Louis Kunsch?

14:46.686 --> 14:50.223
I do. Louis Kunsch was
a New York artist.

14:50.256 --> 14:53.093
You say "Kunsch."
I say "Koonsch."

14:53.126 --> 14:54.594
These are oil-on-canvas
paintings.

14:54.627 --> 14:55.662
Okay.

14:55.695 --> 14:57.464
They're surrealist
in nature.

14:57.497 --> 14:58.732
I know that these are the ones

14:58.765 --> 15:00.600
that are gonna
keep people talking.

15:00.633 --> 15:03.036
I was gonna suggest
you put them in the closet.

15:06.039 --> 15:07.907
How do you say that,
as an art appraiser?

15:07.941 --> 15:09.042
Isn't everything beautiful?

15:09.075 --> 15:12.212
No, as an art appraiser,
I look at value.

15:12.245 --> 15:13.346
Sure.

15:13.380 --> 15:14.681
And, to be honest,

15:14.714 --> 15:17.083
the value of his
oil-on-canvas works

15:17.117 --> 15:19.452
is negligible,
if anything.

15:21.121 --> 15:23.456
What you're saying, though,
is, they're--

15:23.490 --> 15:25.225
they're priceless.

15:25.258 --> 15:27.193
- Use that.
- Perfect.

15:27.227 --> 15:31.798
He mostly became well known
for his later works,

15:31.831 --> 15:34.401
these abstract works
on paper.

15:34.434 --> 15:37.303
They look great here.
They look great on the walls.

15:37.337 --> 15:38.738
How valuable is this stuff?

15:38.772 --> 15:42.809
I would say you could fairly ask
$800 to $1,000 per piece.

15:42.842 --> 15:44.944
What?

15:44.978 --> 15:47.113
But the frame costs more
than that.

15:47.147 --> 15:49.449
The frame was a big part
of that consideration.

15:51.518 --> 15:53.987
He passed away in 2011,
and since then,

15:54.087 --> 15:56.656
there hasn't been much
of an interest in his work.

15:56.690 --> 15:58.091
I mean, this stuff
was in a museum.

15:58.124 --> 16:00.660
The artist worked at the
Metropolitan Museum of Art.

16:00.694 --> 16:03.296
His work isn't actually
in the museum,

16:03.329 --> 16:04.831
like, on exhibit.

16:04.864 --> 16:06.466
Is this
an inaccurate statement?

16:06.499 --> 16:08.301
"Louis Kunsch was in

16:08.335 --> 16:10.503
the Metropolitan Museum
of Art."

16:10.537 --> 16:13.073
That is technically
an accurate statement.

16:13.106 --> 16:14.074
Perfect, great.
Amazing.

16:14.107 --> 16:16.242
Go with it.

16:16.276 --> 16:18.044
I think that
the best chance you have

16:18.044 --> 16:19.512
for selling these paintings

16:19.546 --> 16:21.047
is to hang them
in the apartment

16:21.047 --> 16:23.049
and hope that someone
who loves the apartment

16:23.049 --> 16:25.051
loves the paintings.

16:25.051 --> 16:26.119
Gotcha.

16:26.152 --> 16:28.488
So Eddie bought a bunch of art,

16:28.521 --> 16:30.223
and the only thing it's good for

16:30.256 --> 16:32.425
is to stage an apartment.

16:32.459 --> 16:35.328
And I get to be the one
that tells him.

16:35.362 --> 16:37.230
Awesome.

16:37.263 --> 16:38.531
Thank you so much.

16:38.565 --> 16:39.933
I'm sorry I couldn't be
of more help.

16:46.306 --> 16:47.340
(Fredrik)
Hi!

16:47.374 --> 16:49.075
- Hey!
- Oh, it looks great.

16:49.109 --> 16:50.710
(woman)
We're not finished.
We're getting there.

16:50.744 --> 16:52.746
Okay, and it smells good.
The food smells good.

16:52.779 --> 16:55.115
So this is Chinese, authentic.

16:55.148 --> 16:57.250
The last few years,
Chinese buyers

16:57.283 --> 16:59.586
have really taken over
the luxury segment

16:59.619 --> 17:01.921
of real estate
around Central Park.

17:02.022 --> 17:02.922
Oh, I love these.

17:03.023 --> 17:04.090
I just came back
from Hong Kong.

17:04.124 --> 17:05.425
This is what they have there.

17:05.458 --> 17:09.229
So why not throw a big
Chinese-inspired open house

17:09.262 --> 17:11.297
to lure the buyers in?

17:11.331 --> 17:15.602
Okay, so I bought
these beautiful fabrics

17:15.635 --> 17:17.470
in China, okay?

17:17.504 --> 17:19.739
And the one that I'm not
wearing, you can wear.

17:19.773 --> 17:21.341
What?

17:21.374 --> 17:22.709
That's for you.

17:22.742 --> 17:23.910
I just came back

17:23.943 --> 17:25.545
from a really productive
business trip in China,

17:25.578 --> 17:27.280
and a friend I made there

17:27.313 --> 17:31.885
helped me find special outfits
for very important occasions.

17:31.918 --> 17:34.054
Look how beautiful this is.
Isn't it gorgeous?

17:34.054 --> 17:36.890
And what is more important
than a $35 million listing?

17:36.923 --> 17:40.060
What's wrong?
What's the problem?

17:40.060 --> 17:41.761
You look worried.

17:41.795 --> 17:45.598
I'm a little--

17:45.632 --> 17:47.734
Wait, there's a mirror here.

17:47.767 --> 17:50.470
I think it's really beautiful.

17:50.503 --> 17:52.072
It's classy.
It's authentic.

17:52.072 --> 17:54.074
Okay, so put it on.

17:56.142 --> 17:57.277
It seems like you--
if you don't--

17:57.310 --> 17:59.079
I'll wear it.
I'll be happy to wear it.

17:59.079 --> 18:00.347
Oh, no.
It has that on it?

18:00.380 --> 18:01.581
No, mm-mm.

18:01.614 --> 18:03.249
What do you mean?

18:03.283 --> 18:04.584
This.

18:04.617 --> 18:05.752
What?

18:05.785 --> 18:07.454
I just really don't--
I'm just--

18:07.487 --> 18:10.824
for the sake of everything good
in this world,

18:10.857 --> 18:12.125
uh, please don't.

18:12.158 --> 18:13.927
I'm gonna step out on a limb

18:14.027 --> 18:15.428
and say that's probably
not good.

18:15.462 --> 18:17.197
Okay, so I'll only
wear this now.

18:17.230 --> 18:18.932
And then maybe when the party--
if the party gets there,

18:19.032 --> 18:19.933
I'll put this on.

18:20.033 --> 18:21.568
How would we get there?

18:21.601 --> 18:23.236
That's my question.

18:23.269 --> 18:26.039
I've always been
very adventurous

18:26.039 --> 18:27.040
in celebrating other cultures.

18:27.073 --> 18:28.375
You have to understand
something about me.

18:28.408 --> 18:29.743
I take this
very seriously.

18:29.776 --> 18:31.111
I mean, traveling everywhere,

18:31.144 --> 18:33.580
learning their customs
and languages.

18:33.613 --> 18:35.115
Can you translate for me

18:35.148 --> 18:36.616
"the best view
in New York City"?

18:36.649 --> 18:39.486
[recording
of woman speaking Chinese]

18:40.653 --> 18:41.888
It's very difficult,
this thing.

18:48.194 --> 18:50.530
That last word, "shang,"

18:50.563 --> 18:52.732
you don't pronounce "ng,"
you go "shian."

18:52.766 --> 18:53.967
Don't you think
that most of them

18:54.067 --> 18:55.535
are going to speak English
anyway?

18:55.568 --> 18:56.936
Of course they're going
to speak English.

18:56.970 --> 18:59.172
That's not the point.
It's the thought that counts.

18:59.205 --> 19:01.508
Yes, these are local
New York brokers,

19:01.541 --> 19:03.576
but they're mostly
from Asia.

19:03.610 --> 19:06.112
They still have a lot of clients
from their home country.

19:06.146 --> 19:07.847
And I told them if they had
any buyers

19:07.881 --> 19:09.115
visiting from abroad,

19:09.149 --> 19:10.350
they should bring them
to the open house.

19:10.383 --> 19:11.451
Maybe they would buy
the place.

19:11.484 --> 19:14.521
And I want those visitors
to feel welcome.

19:14.554 --> 19:16.056
You have not even tried--

19:16.089 --> 19:17.490
in all the years
that we worked together,

19:17.524 --> 19:20.360
you have not even tried to learn
a single word in Swedish.

19:20.393 --> 19:21.895
It's like maybe I come in
to the office in the morning

19:21.928 --> 19:23.163
and you're like...

19:23.196 --> 19:25.298
[speaking Swedish]

19:25.331 --> 19:27.434
It would mean a lot to me.
Don't you understand?

19:29.035 --> 19:30.036
[gasps]
Five more minutes.

19:30.036 --> 19:31.571
Michelle,
get the food ready.

19:31.604 --> 19:33.940
I love Peking duck.

19:36.376 --> 19:38.044
What's going on?

19:38.044 --> 19:40.947
How do you tell someone
that their really big investment

19:41.047 --> 19:44.284
isn't worth...
money?

19:54.394 --> 19:55.362
[doorbell rings]

19:55.395 --> 19:56.396
(Fredrik)
Hi. Fredrik.

19:56.429 --> 19:57.464
Hi, how are you?

19:57.497 --> 19:58.665
Oh, my God, hi.
You're so beautiful.

19:58.698 --> 20:00.266
[speaking Chinese]

20:00.300 --> 20:01.501
Good to meet you.
How are you doing?

20:01.534 --> 20:05.572
So welcome
to the most iconic building

20:05.605 --> 20:07.140
in all of New York,
right?

20:07.173 --> 20:08.775
We're on the 54th floor.

20:08.808 --> 20:11.845
And what's so unique about
this duplex is exactly that.

20:11.878 --> 20:13.279
It's two entire floors.

20:13.313 --> 20:14.914
And what do you guys think
about the views?

20:14.948 --> 20:17.317
- Amazing.
[overlapping chatter]

20:17.350 --> 20:18.852
- Amazing, right?
- Absolutely.

20:18.885 --> 20:21.021
How do you say
"beautiful view"?

20:23.356 --> 20:24.324
Perfect.

20:24.357 --> 20:25.725
You're perfect.

20:25.759 --> 20:27.894
(Fredrik)
Tonight, I've invited
New York brokers

20:27.927 --> 20:30.163
with the best connections
in Asia--

20:30.196 --> 20:32.599
Shanghai, Beijing, Hong Kong.

20:32.632 --> 20:35.035
So let me show you guys
around.

20:35.068 --> 20:37.037
It's about 3,700 square feet,

20:37.070 --> 20:38.972
four bedroom, four full baths.

20:39.005 --> 20:40.874
Look at the light in here.
Isn't it incredible?

20:40.907 --> 20:44.444
The entire top floor
is one big master.

20:44.477 --> 20:45.812
Your buyers are gonna love this,
no?

20:45.845 --> 20:46.913
Yeah.

20:46.946 --> 20:48.048
Almost all the big deals
that we do now

20:48.081 --> 20:49.649
around the park,
it's all Chinese money.

20:49.683 --> 20:50.650
Cash buyers.

20:50.684 --> 20:52.285
Cash, yes.

20:52.318 --> 20:53.586
Why is it so much cash?

20:53.620 --> 20:55.522
(woman)
Well, Chinese people
don't do debt.

20:55.555 --> 20:57.624
- They don't like mortgage.
- No.

20:57.657 --> 21:00.427
I don't like mortgage either.
I like cash.

21:00.460 --> 21:01.795
So what do you guys think?

21:01.828 --> 21:03.229
10,000 per square feet
is a bit high.

21:03.263 --> 21:05.665
You have a buyer.

21:05.699 --> 21:07.067
It's beautiful view
and everything,

21:07.067 --> 21:08.668
but still...

21:11.071 --> 21:12.572
- You are a buyer?
- Yes.

21:12.605 --> 21:14.974
-<i>Ni hao.</i>
<i>Ni hao.</i>

21:15.075 --> 21:16.876
I'm Japanese.
<i>"Ni hao"</i>is Chinese.

21:16.910 --> 21:19.079
Oh, I know Japanese.
Wait.

21:19.112 --> 21:22.749
[speaking Japanese]

21:22.782 --> 21:24.718
[speaking Japanese]

21:24.751 --> 21:26.086
See, I speak
every language.

21:26.119 --> 21:27.320
[laughs]

21:27.354 --> 21:31.224
How do you say "I love
this walk-in closet"?

21:31.257 --> 21:32.459
"Ai."

21:33.927 --> 21:35.729
- Oh, love.
- Love is "ai."

21:35.762 --> 21:37.397
I love you.

21:37.430 --> 21:39.766
[laughter]

21:39.799 --> 21:42.102
No one has
these kind of views,

21:42.135 --> 21:43.136
these finishes.

21:43.169 --> 21:45.605
$35 million is a steal.

21:45.638 --> 21:47.707
Uh, 35 million?

21:47.741 --> 21:50.343
$35 million
is a little high.

21:50.377 --> 21:52.479
High as in 54th floor?

21:54.014 --> 21:57.417
Of course almost everyone
is saying the price is high,

21:57.450 --> 21:59.619
the price is high,
the price is too high.

21:59.652 --> 22:04.858
And here I am thinking,
"Cheryl wanted $50 million."

22:04.891 --> 22:06.793
So what do you--what
do you think about this?

22:09.195 --> 22:10.930
(Fredrik)
How is she even gonna react

22:10.964 --> 22:13.633
if I tell her I want
to lower the price?

22:17.737 --> 22:19.739
Yeah, when we negotiate,
I'll be dressed like this.

22:22.442 --> 22:24.711
Wait, the hat
with the long thing?

22:24.744 --> 22:26.079
With the long braid.

22:26.112 --> 22:27.380
- Jordan?
- Yeah?

22:27.414 --> 22:29.716
(Fredrik)
I told you!

22:36.322 --> 22:38.258
(Ryan)
James, it's Ryan Serhant.

22:38.291 --> 22:39.659
Nest Seekers.
How are you?

22:39.693 --> 22:41.561
So I just wanted to make sure
that you got the invite

22:41.594 --> 22:43.663
for the 57 Reade open house.

22:45.098 --> 22:46.366
Awesome.
Okay, I'll see you there.

22:46.399 --> 22:48.568
What's going on?

22:50.103 --> 22:53.873
I don't know if I'm ready
for Eddie right now.

22:53.907 --> 22:55.141
What's that?

22:55.175 --> 22:57.110
A gift for you.

22:57.110 --> 22:58.611
I want you to be motivated.

22:58.645 --> 23:00.947
A little piece of art
that hopefully, one day,

23:01.047 --> 23:02.882
would be worth
a lot of money.

23:02.916 --> 23:06.052
How do you tell someone that
their really big investment

23:06.086 --> 23:09.622
isn't worth...
money?

23:09.656 --> 23:10.890
Look at that!

23:10.924 --> 23:13.259
- Like it?
- Yeah.

23:13.293 --> 23:16.096
So honesty is
the best policy, right?

23:18.264 --> 23:21.568
I had an appraiser come through.

23:21.601 --> 23:22.836
The art...

23:22.869 --> 23:25.672
[whispers]
is worthless, man.

23:25.705 --> 23:28.541
She honestly said
that the frames were worth more

23:28.575 --> 23:30.076
than the art itself.

23:33.913 --> 23:35.348
Something is worth

23:35.382 --> 23:37.183
what somebody's willing
to pay for it.

23:37.217 --> 23:38.351
But, I mean, like,

23:38.385 --> 23:39.986
you wanted me to do
social media, right?

23:40.086 --> 23:40.987
Yeah.

23:41.087 --> 23:42.155
I'll show you.

23:42.188 --> 23:46.659
Here is a photo of me
walking across the street.

23:46.693 --> 23:50.897
4,747 likes.

23:50.930 --> 23:54.934
Here is the art,
which you can see there, right?

23:54.968 --> 23:56.002
Yeah.

23:56.102 --> 23:58.605
Two likes.

23:58.638 --> 23:59.939
You must be
doing something wrong.

24:01.741 --> 24:03.176
Mm-hmm.

24:03.209 --> 24:05.278
Come on.

24:05.311 --> 24:06.579
[sighs]

24:06.613 --> 24:08.048
My God.

24:08.048 --> 24:09.916
I have an idea.

24:09.949 --> 24:11.751
You're a salesperson.

24:11.785 --> 24:13.186
You can sell anything.

24:13.219 --> 24:14.888
Mm-hmm.

24:14.921 --> 24:16.723
Sell.

24:16.756 --> 24:18.058
Gotcha.
Got it.

24:18.058 --> 24:20.126
Okay, marching orders accepted.

24:27.067 --> 24:28.635
For as long as I can remember,

24:28.668 --> 24:31.371
every night, I write
for at least an hour.

24:31.404 --> 24:33.073
Some people choose
to watch a movie.

24:33.073 --> 24:34.641
Some people choose to read.

24:34.674 --> 24:35.909
I choose to write.

24:35.942 --> 24:37.911
It helps me clear my mind.

24:37.944 --> 24:41.514
Right now, the situation
with Angel is--

24:41.548 --> 24:42.949
is very difficult for me,

24:42.982 --> 24:44.584
because I have never asked
a client

24:44.617 --> 24:46.786
to move out
of his own apartment.

24:46.820 --> 24:49.255
Every day that goes by
without me selling this place,

24:49.289 --> 24:52.092
I know that him and his wife
are super uncomfortable

24:52.092 --> 24:54.694
in this rental that they hate.

24:54.728 --> 24:55.862
I need to get out of there.

24:55.895 --> 24:57.397
(Luis)
The open house went great,

24:57.430 --> 24:59.232
and I'm doing everything
that I can

24:59.265 --> 25:00.233
to continue to be proactive.

25:00.266 --> 25:01.735
Charlie, Luis Ortiz.

25:01.768 --> 25:03.803
Calvin, this is Luis Ortiz
from Douglas Elliman.

25:03.837 --> 25:05.739
I have an apartment
at 92 Laight Street.

25:05.772 --> 25:09.609
But so far, still no offers.

25:09.642 --> 25:15.181
[phone buzzing]

25:15.215 --> 25:16.783
[bleep].

25:16.816 --> 25:19.052
This is Adam.

25:19.085 --> 25:20.954
Adam is the rental agent
who owns the apartment

25:21.054 --> 25:22.555
that I put Angel in temporarily.

25:28.294 --> 25:29.696
One or two months.

25:29.729 --> 25:32.899
This is not a phone call
I want to take.

25:32.932 --> 25:34.734
[phone buzzing]

25:34.768 --> 25:37.203
Even the ringtone sounds angry.

25:37.237 --> 25:38.405
Like, too angry.

25:38.438 --> 25:40.206
Adam.

25:40.240 --> 25:42.108
Uh, yes, I do.

25:50.417 --> 25:52.085
Adam doesn't live
in the rental place,

25:52.118 --> 25:53.787
but him and his wife stay there
pretty often.

26:01.294 --> 26:04.597
I understand, Adam, but I have
clients that are in there,

26:04.631 --> 26:06.332
and I can't move them
anywhere else

26:06.366 --> 26:08.601
until I sell their apartment.

26:08.635 --> 26:10.270
That's what we discussed
in the beginning.

26:16.142 --> 26:18.311
I do not like Adam's wife.

26:18.345 --> 26:22.082
I haven't met her,
but I still don't like her.

26:29.589 --> 26:31.791
I hate her.

26:33.526 --> 26:37.297
Um...

26:37.330 --> 26:39.199
All right.

26:39.232 --> 26:41.401
I got to do something.

26:48.274 --> 26:50.276
I was thinking
about raising the price.

26:51.411 --> 26:54.247
This--this cannot happen
to me right now.

27:01.688 --> 27:04.124
[Fredrik speaking Chinese]

27:06.826 --> 27:09.095
How do you say, "We have
a deal" in Korean?

27:11.931 --> 27:14.134
How do you say, "Beautiful
master bathroom" in Chinese?

27:15.669 --> 27:16.903
<i>Meili, meili.</i>

27:16.936 --> 27:19.339
How do you scream,
"I love New York"?

27:20.807 --> 27:22.208
When learning a new language,

27:22.242 --> 27:24.077
it's really important
to surround yourself

27:24.110 --> 27:27.714
with native speakers and
practice, practice, practice.

27:27.747 --> 27:30.050
How do you say "party"?

27:30.083 --> 27:31.651
<i>Dang!</i>
[laughter]

27:45.832 --> 27:47.133
How are you, Papa?
Sorry I'm late.

27:47.167 --> 27:48.168
- Everything good?
- How are you?

27:48.201 --> 27:49.502
How are you?
Good.

27:49.536 --> 27:51.438
(Luis)
I only met Angel
when I took this listing,

27:51.471 --> 27:52.806
but one thing we have in common

27:52.839 --> 27:54.941
is the fact
that we are boxing fans.

27:54.974 --> 27:57.310
Boxing,
not just to him and myself

27:57.344 --> 28:00.647
but to every Puerto Rican,
means hope.

28:00.680 --> 28:02.882
We relate to that very much.

28:02.916 --> 28:04.451
The showing went amazing,
actually.

28:04.484 --> 28:06.019
She loved the apartment.

28:06.019 --> 28:08.154
I haven't had a lot of
showings on this apartment.

28:08.188 --> 28:09.923
But the one that
I just came from

28:10.023 --> 28:11.524
was very, very good.

28:11.558 --> 28:12.625
Let me show you
the third bedroom.

28:12.659 --> 28:13.693
Come this way.

28:13.727 --> 28:15.795
- Any interest?
- Oh, it is interesting.

28:15.829 --> 28:18.331
I was hoping to walk away
with an offer in hands,

28:18.365 --> 28:20.600
which didn't happen,
but I'm still very confident.

28:20.633 --> 28:21.868
She's actually going
to London tonight,

28:21.901 --> 28:24.137
and she said to me
that she might get us an offer

28:24.170 --> 28:26.106
in the next 30 minutes,
just before she goes.

28:28.108 --> 28:30.443
Well, we have
the 4.75.

28:30.477 --> 28:34.481
Just last night, we got
our first official offer,

28:34.514 --> 28:37.150
which came from a buyer
that came to the open house

28:37.183 --> 28:38.151
about a month ago.

28:38.184 --> 28:39.319
It's 200 square feet,

28:39.352 --> 28:41.221
and it has a perfect view
of the Hudson River.

28:41.254 --> 28:43.123
It's 5.1, great price.

28:43.156 --> 28:46.359
It was so low, Angel did not
even want to consider it.

28:46.393 --> 28:47.627
I really want 5.1.

28:47.660 --> 28:49.896
I can't let it go
for 4.75.

28:49.929 --> 28:52.399
(Luis)
The problem is that that's
the only offer

28:52.432 --> 28:55.502
that we've received,
so we cannot ignore it.

28:56.936 --> 28:57.937
I don't know, Lu.

28:57.971 --> 28:58.938
You got to bring them up.

28:58.972 --> 29:00.073
You have a counter?

29:00.106 --> 29:02.275
Try to get 4.9 from them.

29:02.308 --> 29:04.010
All right, give me one second.
Let me give him a call.

29:04.010 --> 29:05.011
I'll be right here
enjoying the fight.

29:05.045 --> 29:06.713
All right.

29:08.782 --> 29:10.450
[phone line ringing]

29:11.451 --> 29:13.019
Yes.

29:13.019 --> 29:14.621
Good, good.

29:14.654 --> 29:15.689
Here's the deal.

29:15.722 --> 29:16.790
If your client wants
the apartment,

29:16.823 --> 29:19.426
he needs to come up to 4.9.

29:30.870 --> 29:33.340
(Luis)
4.9 is the number
that we need to reach.

29:51.925 --> 29:55.829
Okay, so they've agreed
to come up to 4.850.

30:06.172 --> 30:07.340
You know what?
[bleep] it.

30:07.374 --> 30:08.475
Take the number.

30:08.508 --> 30:10.710
Let's just end this
once and for all.

30:10.744 --> 30:12.078
Take the offer.

30:14.914 --> 30:16.716
[exhales]

30:19.386 --> 30:20.920
You know what?

30:20.954 --> 30:24.324
Let's not accept
the offer yet.

30:30.997 --> 30:33.033
(Ryan)
So we want people talking
about the apartment...

30:35.101 --> 30:36.770
Right?
The artist.

30:40.674 --> 30:41.641
- All right.
- Okay.

30:41.675 --> 30:43.243
- Yup.
- Go, team!

30:43.276 --> 30:44.944
Eddie needs me
to sell his apartment

30:44.978 --> 30:46.446
and his art.

30:46.479 --> 30:54.087
So tonight I'm having
an art-partment open house.

30:54.120 --> 30:58.358
The brokers who are coming
just don't know it yet.

31:00.727 --> 31:01.928
Hello.
Welcome.

31:01.961 --> 31:03.530
- Hi. Welcome.
- Thank you.

31:03.563 --> 31:05.799
- You both smell very nice.
- Thank you.

31:07.100 --> 31:10.136
So it's a three-bedroom,
three-bathroom.

31:10.170 --> 31:11.971
It's the combination,
the B and the D line.

31:12.072 --> 31:13.440
We have a big, open
living room.

31:13.473 --> 31:15.608
There's also a very secret
outdoor space.

31:15.642 --> 31:17.344
We're priced
at 4 1/2 million.

31:17.377 --> 31:19.512
Here, I'll give you
a tour. Come on.

31:19.546 --> 31:21.548
And this is the master bedroom.

31:21.581 --> 31:23.316
We have a big walk-in closet
behind us.

31:25.819 --> 31:27.454
You wear very small clothes,
though.

31:27.487 --> 31:28.955
How much--how much
closet space do you need?

31:28.988 --> 31:30.090
It's not really about
the clothes.

31:30.090 --> 31:31.224
It's about the shoes.

31:31.257 --> 31:32.425
How many shoes
do you have?

31:35.195 --> 31:36.796
And this is
your third bedroom,

31:36.830 --> 31:38.264
so this could be
your shoe closet.

31:38.298 --> 31:39.666
[laughter]

31:39.699 --> 31:40.800
Beautiful apartment.

31:40.834 --> 31:42.168
I like it.
It feels very comfortable.

31:42.202 --> 31:43.203
- Good.
- Yeah.

31:43.236 --> 31:45.105
Phase one went well.

31:45.105 --> 31:47.307
And now it's time
for phase two.

31:47.340 --> 31:50.510
We're also featuring
the art of Louis Kunsch.

31:51.678 --> 31:53.346
Louis Kunsch. Can you
say that, "Louis Kunsch"?

31:53.380 --> 31:54.514
- Kunsch.
- Kunsch.

31:54.547 --> 31:56.549
It's not "Cootch."
It's Kunsch.

31:56.583 --> 31:57.951
- Kunsch?
- Kunsch.

31:57.984 --> 31:58.952
Louis Kunsch.

31:58.985 --> 32:00.253
- Kunsch.
- Kunsch.

32:00.286 --> 32:01.621
The Kunschster.

32:02.789 --> 32:04.958
Oh, very famous.
He was. He was.

32:06.459 --> 32:07.460
No, he's dead.

32:07.494 --> 32:09.763
He passed, sadly,
three years ago.

32:09.796 --> 32:11.564
It was a really hard time
for all of us.

32:12.899 --> 32:15.535
What do you think?
What do you think it's worth?

32:15.568 --> 32:17.704
75, 80 bucks?

32:17.737 --> 32:18.805
Maybe 100?

32:18.838 --> 32:21.775
- Dollars?
- Yes.

32:21.808 --> 32:24.210
- That's--
- It's a little dark.

32:24.244 --> 32:26.246
- A little twisted.
- But in a good way.

32:26.279 --> 32:27.580
People like twisted.

32:27.614 --> 32:28.648
I'm not a fan.

32:31.084 --> 32:33.620
(Ryan)
It's obvious these people
aren't willing

32:33.653 --> 32:36.456
to join the Louis Kunsch
fan club.

32:36.489 --> 32:40.627
But sometimes art,
like anything,

32:40.660 --> 32:44.664
needs a story behind it
to get people interested.

32:44.698 --> 32:45.865
It's interesting, actually.

32:45.899 --> 32:47.767
He was in World War II,

32:47.801 --> 32:50.303
and he lost
both of his arms.

32:50.337 --> 32:54.841
And he would paint
with his artificial limbs.

32:54.874 --> 32:57.877
He was the oldest living man
to still have

32:57.911 --> 33:00.880
his umbilical cord
attached to his body.

33:00.914 --> 33:03.683
He was also, you know,
partially blind.

33:03.717 --> 33:05.218
- What?
- Yeah.

33:05.251 --> 33:06.786
- Do you make up this stuff?
- I don't make up this stuff.

33:06.820 --> 33:08.455
- [laughs]
- You could sell both.

33:08.488 --> 33:10.690
It doesn't make me want
to buy this art more.

33:15.128 --> 33:18.198
These people have no soul,
is what I'm realizing.

33:18.231 --> 33:19.532
I mean, this is great,

33:19.566 --> 33:21.067
but can we take a look
at the rest of the apartment?

33:21.067 --> 33:22.402
Oh, sure.

33:22.435 --> 33:23.970
You'll see more--we'll talk
about it later.

33:24.070 --> 33:25.605
Thanks. I'll take you this way,
to the living room.

33:25.638 --> 33:26.740
Perfect.
Thank you.

33:26.773 --> 33:27.841
- Yeah, for sure.
- After you.

33:27.874 --> 33:28.942
Okay.

33:40.487 --> 33:42.122
[bell dings]

33:43.390 --> 33:44.391
You know what?
[bleep] it.

33:44.424 --> 33:45.458
Just take it.

33:45.492 --> 33:48.728
Let's just end this
once and for all.

33:48.762 --> 33:49.929
Take the offer.

33:57.137 --> 33:58.138
(Luis)
You know what?

33:58.171 --> 34:00.340
Let's not accept
the offer yet.

34:00.373 --> 34:01.675
I know this apartment's
worth more.

34:01.708 --> 34:02.909
I'm not going to let you
go down like that.

34:02.942 --> 34:05.345
We still have another person
on the table.

34:05.378 --> 34:07.681
Why don't we wait?

34:07.714 --> 34:12.052
It's like even though
he's accepting an offer,

34:12.052 --> 34:13.586
he's not winning.

34:13.620 --> 34:16.322
It's like I didn't do
my job.

34:16.356 --> 34:18.091
That's at least how I feel.

34:18.124 --> 34:19.125
All right, here we go.

34:22.062 --> 34:22.962
[exhales]

34:23.063 --> 34:24.464
Ah, 4.9!

34:24.497 --> 34:26.099
4.9, I'm telling you.
I'm telling you.

34:26.132 --> 34:27.167
I'm telling you.

34:27.200 --> 34:28.635
Now we're actually boxing.

34:28.668 --> 34:29.969
Now I can feel it.

34:30.070 --> 34:32.372
Okay, hang on tight.

34:32.405 --> 34:33.473
All right,
I'll be right back.

34:33.506 --> 34:34.607
Now I have leverage.

34:34.641 --> 34:38.611
Now I have to get
my first buyer up.

34:38.645 --> 34:39.746
[phone line rings]

34:39.779 --> 34:41.481
Cooper, listen.
Things have changed.

34:41.514 --> 34:42.782
An offer just came in.

34:42.816 --> 34:44.384
I came from a showing
that I did 30 minutes ago.

34:44.417 --> 34:45.952
And this client is legit,

34:45.985 --> 34:47.454
so for your buyer to take
this apartment,

34:47.487 --> 34:48.955
he needs to come in
at full ask.

34:51.758 --> 34:52.959
I'm not joking.

34:52.992 --> 34:54.661
We already have an offer
that is much higher.

34:56.496 --> 34:57.797
I cannot tell you the number.

34:57.831 --> 34:58.998
I'm sorry, Cooper.
I cannot tell you the number.

35:02.335 --> 35:03.703
I'm telling you
what's going to happen.

35:03.737 --> 35:06.773
If they don't come up,
we will accept this offer.

35:14.047 --> 35:15.615
Just talk to your clients,

35:15.648 --> 35:17.050
and see if they can come up
to full ask

35:17.050 --> 35:18.118
or close to full ask.

35:42.542 --> 35:44.611
[phone line ringing]

35:49.382 --> 35:50.817
This is Luis.
How are you?

35:50.850 --> 35:52.652
I'm good.

35:52.686 --> 35:54.087
Listen, thank you very much
for your offer.

35:54.087 --> 35:57.123
So this is what we're gonna do
to wrap this up.

35:57.157 --> 35:59.693
The asking price is 5.1.
You're at 4.9.

35:59.726 --> 36:01.695
Let's meet each other
on the middle

36:01.728 --> 36:04.464
and close out at 5 million.

36:05.865 --> 36:07.033
If she comes to 5 million

36:07.033 --> 36:08.668
before she takes that flight
to London,

36:08.702 --> 36:11.805
we will have an offer accepted
before she leaves.

36:11.838 --> 36:13.673
[bleep].

36:13.707 --> 36:14.874
[bell dings]

36:18.044 --> 36:19.813
All right, we're just
gonna have to wait

36:19.846 --> 36:21.047
and see what happens.

36:28.054 --> 36:29.122
[sighs]

36:29.155 --> 36:32.525
If I fail,
this could cost me everything.

36:32.559 --> 36:34.060
[bell dings]

36:41.668 --> 36:43.303
I need an ask.

36:51.077 --> 36:53.580
Ah!

36:55.181 --> 36:56.750
What happened?

36:56.783 --> 36:59.252
We're all confirmed,
$5 million--

36:59.285 --> 37:01.187
- Wow.
- All cash. Let's wrap it up.

37:01.221 --> 37:02.889
Boom!
Mother[bleep]!

37:02.922 --> 37:05.025
Mother[bleep]!
5 million!

37:05.025 --> 37:06.860
- Yes!
- 5 million.

37:06.893 --> 37:09.129
Boom!

37:09.162 --> 37:12.766
Muhammad Ali has...
concur.

37:12.799 --> 37:14.234
Is that the word?
I don't care.

37:14.267 --> 37:15.602
I have beat the other guy down.

37:15.635 --> 37:17.337
George Foreman, go cook me
a [bleep] sandwich

37:17.370 --> 37:18.638
with your machines.

37:18.672 --> 37:21.174
Retire yourself.
[laughs]

37:21.207 --> 37:22.409
[bell dings]

37:22.442 --> 37:23.543
Oh, my man.

37:23.576 --> 37:25.945
Finally, I can enjoy
this fight!

37:30.517 --> 37:31.518
(Luis)
Wow.

37:31.551 --> 37:32.752
[cheers and applause]

37:38.725 --> 37:40.493
- Hello.
- Hi.

37:40.527 --> 37:41.494
How are you?

37:41.528 --> 37:42.662
I don't know
who to kiss first,

37:42.696 --> 37:43.930
you or Luis.

37:43.963 --> 37:45.832
Mwah!
Mwah!

37:45.865 --> 37:47.100
Hi, baby boy.
How are you?

37:47.133 --> 37:48.401
Okay, so tell me

37:48.435 --> 37:49.836
what's going on
with the apartment.

37:49.869 --> 37:52.238
The feedback
that I'm getting so far--

37:52.272 --> 37:53.740
it's beautiful, amazing.

37:53.773 --> 37:56.276
The views, the finishes.

37:56.309 --> 37:58.078
But...

37:58.111 --> 38:01.114
[speaking Chinese]

38:02.916 --> 38:04.517
And what does that mean?

38:04.551 --> 38:06.019
It's priced high.

38:06.019 --> 38:08.621
I was thinking
about raising the price.

38:10.790 --> 38:12.592
What?

38:12.625 --> 38:13.893
No, wai--no.

38:13.927 --> 38:15.562
It's 35--it's $35 million.

38:15.595 --> 38:19.466
I thought 42 would be
a nice change.

38:19.499 --> 38:22.235
I just think that if it sits
on the market too long

38:22.268 --> 38:23.937
with no change,
at the same price,

38:24.037 --> 38:25.171
it gets stale.

38:25.205 --> 38:26.539
It's been on the market
for just a few weeks.

38:26.573 --> 38:27.640
It's not stale.
Trust me.

38:27.674 --> 38:29.042
These things
just don't happen overnight,

38:29.042 --> 38:31.811
especially when you have to go
outside New York,

38:31.845 --> 38:33.113
internationally,
to look for the buyer.

38:33.146 --> 38:35.615
If you raise the price now,

38:35.648 --> 38:37.650
what is that gonna do
to the people that have seen it

38:37.684 --> 38:39.386
or are actually
really interested?

38:39.419 --> 38:41.521
You don't have any offers,
so what's the difference?

38:41.554 --> 38:42.655
The difference
is that I don't want

38:42.689 --> 38:44.257
the little traffic that we have
to die off.

38:44.290 --> 38:45.759
Well, maybe
it'll raise the traffic.

38:45.792 --> 38:46.760
That's not how it works.
Not how it works.

38:46.793 --> 38:48.361
I--I disagree.

38:48.395 --> 38:51.831
This--this cannot happen
to me right now.

38:51.865 --> 38:54.100
Raising the price will kill--

38:54.134 --> 38:57.370
it will kill all my momentum.

38:57.404 --> 38:59.539
We priced it too low.

39:04.577 --> 39:07.047
You're giving me
a crappy offer.

39:07.080 --> 39:08.481
You bought this apartment
a year ago.

39:08.515 --> 39:10.650
It doesn't matter.

39:14.621 --> 39:19.526
[cheerful guitar music]

39:19.559 --> 39:20.627
[horn honks]

39:20.660 --> 39:22.662
(man)
Order up! Next.

39:22.696 --> 39:24.264
Last week,
I invited you to lunch.

39:26.032 --> 39:28.234
You take me to a park
to have a [bleep] burger.

39:30.170 --> 39:32.872
(Ryan)
After my art-partment
open house,

39:32.906 --> 39:34.774
I get an offer...

39:34.808 --> 39:36.509
on the apartment.

39:36.543 --> 39:38.578
Had nothing to do
with the art.

39:42.816 --> 39:43.850
Which I'm pretty sure

39:43.883 --> 39:46.252
is gonna make Eddie
a little angry.

39:46.286 --> 39:48.121
It's a heart attack.

39:48.154 --> 39:50.357
Excellent, goes well with
my workout this morning.

39:50.390 --> 39:52.659
(Ryan)
I've seen mob movies.

39:52.692 --> 39:55.195
If you think you're gonna
get whacked by your boss,

39:55.228 --> 39:57.564
you set that meeting in public.

40:00.367 --> 40:01.601
I have an offer for you.

40:01.634 --> 40:03.269
Okay.

40:03.303 --> 40:04.838
3, 3 1/2.

40:04.871 --> 40:06.639
3 1/2?

40:06.673 --> 40:11.277
3.5, that has a familiar ring
to it, doesn't it?

40:11.311 --> 40:12.846
So what do you think
it's worth?

40:12.879 --> 40:15.348
Honestly, you're looking
at, like, in the 3s.

40:16.850 --> 40:18.485
It's ridiculous.

40:18.518 --> 40:21.855
Clearly, you're not
as excited as I am.

40:21.888 --> 40:24.190
You know, this burger is
starting to taste like crap.

40:24.224 --> 40:26.092
It's because you're
letting it get cold.

40:26.126 --> 40:30.130
Oh, and this buyer
doesn't want the art.

40:30.163 --> 40:31.231
They just want
the apartment.

40:31.264 --> 40:32.232
What?

40:32.265 --> 40:34.467
I did everything I could,
everything.

40:34.501 --> 40:36.202
Louis Kunsch was--

40:36.236 --> 40:38.038
Kunsch. Why you say it with,
like, a French accent?

40:38.071 --> 40:39.406
- Kunsch.
- Kunsch.

40:39.439 --> 40:41.307
- Kunsch.
- That's it, Kunsch.

40:41.341 --> 40:43.176
Since he's been dead...

40:43.209 --> 40:44.244
Right.

40:44.277 --> 40:45.412
He's sort of faded
off the map.

40:45.445 --> 40:47.447
But the whole point
is that when they die,

40:47.480 --> 40:48.982
it's worth a lot more.

40:49.015 --> 40:52.218
That's true...for
every artist but this one.

40:52.252 --> 40:53.720
[laughs]

40:53.753 --> 40:56.890
Listen, you're giving me
a crappy offer.

40:56.923 --> 40:58.324
You bought this apartment
a year ago.

40:58.358 --> 41:00.293
You work for Nest Seekers.

41:00.326 --> 41:02.462
You're supposed to get
a premium.

41:02.495 --> 41:05.065
The guy's max
on this apartment, right,

41:05.098 --> 41:06.766
is 3.725.

41:06.800 --> 41:10.170
Yes, I did get a max price
from the buyer.

41:10.203 --> 41:11.404
And if Eddie'll agree to it,

41:11.438 --> 41:12.839
then I'm authorized
to close the deal.

41:12.872 --> 41:14.574
But they said
anything higher than that,

41:14.607 --> 41:16.776
then don't even bother
calling them.

41:16.810 --> 41:18.445
It's higher than anything else
that they're selling

41:18.478 --> 41:20.246
that's comparable
in 72 Reade.

41:20.280 --> 41:21.247
That's a brand-new building.

41:21.281 --> 41:22.549
It's over 2,000 a foot.

41:22.582 --> 41:24.150
It's just under
2,000 a foot.

41:26.086 --> 41:29.689
3.95, and we can
put this thing to bed.

41:29.723 --> 41:30.724
Then there's no deal.

41:30.757 --> 41:32.158
They won't do it.

41:32.192 --> 41:35.362
It's $50 a foot
you're fighting me over.

41:35.395 --> 41:37.831
That's what you're
fighting me over.

41:37.864 --> 41:39.866
3.725.

41:41.501 --> 41:43.803
I'm--it's got to be
a trade, then.

41:43.837 --> 41:46.539
I want you basically
on retainer on the art thing

41:46.573 --> 41:47.640
for another six months.

41:47.674 --> 41:49.142
Oh, my God.

41:49.175 --> 41:51.878
Are you kidding me?

41:51.911 --> 41:53.380
I see Kunsch selling

41:53.413 --> 41:55.982
for as much as any one
of those properties.

41:56.016 --> 41:59.285
I will do everything possible
to sell this art for you.

42:02.589 --> 42:03.556
Okay.

42:03.590 --> 42:05.225
- Deal?
- Fine.

42:06.526 --> 42:07.961
- Okay?
- Okay.

42:08.061 --> 42:09.362
You have to handshake.

42:09.396 --> 42:11.431
That's real in this business.

42:13.733 --> 42:15.201
Okay.

42:15.235 --> 42:17.404
Now I want to go and figure out
how to digest this thing.

42:17.437 --> 42:19.739
Hold on.
You just got--

42:19.773 --> 42:21.074
[sound of bomb whistling]

42:21.074 --> 42:24.077
I want to go and figure out
how to digest...

42:24.077 --> 42:26.079
[laughs]

42:26.112 --> 42:27.881
What the [bleep]
are we doing here?

42:27.914 --> 42:28.915
God damn it.

42:28.948 --> 42:30.550
[laughs]

42:30.583 --> 42:33.186

42:33.219 --> 42:34.821
Raising the price would be
the death for it right now.

42:34.854 --> 42:36.089
I'm the client,

42:36.122 --> 42:38.091
and I don't appreciate you
being so rude.

42:38.124 --> 42:41.561
- What's that?
- A letter drafted by Cheryl.

42:42.862 --> 42:43.997
Oh, my God.

42:44.097 --> 42:45.932
We are expecting
to sell this property

42:45.965 --> 42:47.100
for 6 million.

42:47.133 --> 42:49.636
The apartment is priced
a little high.

42:49.669 --> 42:53.707
Ryan, excuse my language,
but it sounds like bull[bleep].

42:54.874 --> 42:56.943
This is a party, all right?
So come over.
