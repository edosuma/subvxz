WEBVTT

00:05.838 --> 00:08.096
_

00:14.293 --> 00:15.425
Hey.

00:15.494 --> 00:17.995
What's his problem? Is this his chicken?

00:18.063 --> 00:19.374
Tonight was the first time that his band

00:19.398 --> 00:20.831
played to an empty house.

00:20.899 --> 00:22.547
Even the baristas left.

00:22.578 --> 00:24.745
They gave me the keys to lock up.

00:25.064 --> 00:26.430
Oh, shoot.

00:27.274 --> 00:28.303
Hey.

00:28.328 --> 00:30.017
Funeral Goose played tonight, huh?

00:30.086 --> 00:32.052
Yep. It's a Friday.

00:32.077 --> 00:33.965
I've played every Friday for a year.

00:34.251 --> 00:36.451
You guys play every Friday? Really?

00:36.476 --> 00:37.513
Yep.

00:37.538 --> 00:38.959
So if it's a Friday,

00:39.028 --> 00:40.061
you guys are playing?

00:40.129 --> 00:40.928
Yes.

00:40.997 --> 00:42.029
What if there's a month

00:42.098 --> 00:43.230
with five Fridays?

00:43.299 --> 00:44.499
You playing all those Fridays?

00:44.534 --> 00:46.371
Yes! Oh, my God. You know what?

00:46.396 --> 00:47.656
It doesn't even matter.

00:47.681 --> 00:49.515
Why do I bother anymore?

00:51.356 --> 00:54.057
We're the worst, Heather.

00:54.082 --> 00:56.093
What kind of parents don't
support their kid's dreams?

00:56.117 --> 00:58.190
Oh, honey, if we supported
all of Tyler's dreams,

00:58.214 --> 01:00.915
he'd be a Mack truck
turned into a robot.

01:00.983 --> 01:03.022
Yeah, but I know what it's like

01:03.047 --> 01:04.593
to have parents that
don't believe in you.

01:04.617 --> 01:09.972
I mean, I never... told you
this about myself, but...

01:09.997 --> 01:11.030
The diving?

01:11.300 --> 01:12.538
Oh, yeah.

01:12.563 --> 01:13.804
- Yeah.
- Well, then you already know

01:13.828 --> 01:16.229
that my parents never
came to a single meet.

01:16.298 --> 01:18.031
Babe, I know. Listen,
why don't you go look

01:18.099 --> 01:20.111
at some of those diving medals
that you keep in a shoebox,

01:20.135 --> 01:22.151
with the bird's nest and the seashells.

01:24.673 --> 01:26.773
Yeah.

01:26.841 --> 01:29.086
I'll have a snack while I'm down there.

01:31.947 --> 01:33.613
Well, here we are.

01:33.682 --> 01:35.548
Oh, this doesn't look
like The Container Store.

01:35.617 --> 01:37.350
I must have taken a wrong turn.

01:37.419 --> 01:39.752
Dad, we seriously need
to buy stackable storage.

01:39.821 --> 01:41.187
What's going on?

01:41.256 --> 01:42.922
It's a recording studio.

01:42.991 --> 01:45.291
Yeah, clearly. Why are we here?

01:45.327 --> 01:46.726
To record your new demo.

01:46.795 --> 01:48.061
What?

01:48.129 --> 01:49.307
A patient of mine owns the place,

01:49.331 --> 01:50.763
so he owed me big-time.

01:50.832 --> 01:52.803
All I had to do was pay
for the studio musicians

01:52.828 --> 01:54.413
and the engineer.

01:54.438 --> 01:56.469
And the enormous fee for rental.

01:56.851 --> 01:58.705
Dad, you really didn't have to do this.

01:58.773 --> 02:01.207
I wanted to do this.
You are a born musician.

02:01.276 --> 02:03.162
Just like I'm a born negotiator.

02:03.187 --> 02:04.377
Now get in there.

02:04.446 --> 02:05.745
Seriously, get in there.

02:05.814 --> 02:07.297
They're charging me by the minute.

02:07.322 --> 02:08.758
And remember:

02:08.782 --> 02:13.013
if I could give you one piece
of advice on music, I would.

02:21.013 --> 02:23.596
♪ Climb higher and higher ♪

02:23.665 --> 02:25.164
♪ Up past the sky... ♪

02:25.233 --> 02:26.818
Sorry.

02:27.763 --> 02:30.303
No worries. Let's just
pick it up from the chorus.

02:36.044 --> 02:38.511

02:38.580 --> 02:40.480

02:46.583 --> 02:48.201
Is this the bridge?

02:48.560 --> 02:49.791
I hope not.

02:49.816 --> 02:51.549
Let me talk to him.

02:53.061 --> 02:54.627
Hey, what's the problem in there, bud?

02:54.696 --> 02:56.863
The problem is me. I'm terrible.

02:56.931 --> 02:58.464
What? You're not terrible.

02:58.533 --> 03:00.300
Right? He's not terrible.

03:00.368 --> 03:01.968
Uh, yeah, you're not great.

03:02.037 --> 03:03.970
Why would you say that? I'm paying you.

03:04.039 --> 03:05.204
Of course he's bad, man.

03:05.273 --> 03:06.773
But you don't say that.

03:06.841 --> 03:08.586
Right. I'm still pressing
the button, by the way.

03:08.610 --> 03:10.639
Why would you do that? I'm paying you!

03:10.664 --> 03:12.168
No. He's right.

03:12.193 --> 03:14.480
I don't have what it takes
to make it as a musician,

03:14.505 --> 03:18.074
and I think, uh, I think maybe
I've known for a long time now.

03:20.000 --> 03:26.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:30.231 --> 03:32.298
Hey. I'm proud of you.

03:32.367 --> 03:34.178
I know that was a hard thing
to admit, but you're not

03:34.202 --> 03:37.303
the only one who's ever
given up on a dream.

03:37.372 --> 03:39.405
I never told you this
about myself, but...

03:39.474 --> 03:40.740
- I...
- The diving?

03:41.522 --> 03:42.591
Oh, yeah.

03:42.616 --> 03:45.044
Well, I may have had a nose for diving,

03:45.113 --> 03:47.313
but I didn't have the ears.

03:47.818 --> 03:49.020
I developed swimmer's ear.

03:49.045 --> 03:52.185
Spent more time in the
doctor's office than the pool.

03:52.253 --> 03:55.120
And it was only then,
while completely dry,

03:55.145 --> 03:57.566
that my appetite was finally whet.

03:58.616 --> 04:01.550
I realized I wanted to be an
ear, nose and throat doctor.

04:02.980 --> 04:04.731
So you're saying I could be a doctor?

04:04.799 --> 04:07.867
Oh, no, way. But look,

04:08.136 --> 04:10.164
you'll find your own path someday.

04:10.253 --> 04:12.887
And hey, just 'cause you're
not playing music for a living

04:12.912 --> 04:15.573
doesn't mean you can't go back
to it any time you want to.

04:16.048 --> 04:18.015
Have you ever gone back to diving?

04:20.153 --> 04:22.486
Not in a long time.

04:25.386 --> 04:26.957
What are you looking at?

05:14.011 --> 05:15.671
_

05:18.585 --> 05:22.240
Oh, man. Oof. This
heartburn is the worst.

05:22.265 --> 05:24.689
Feels like the baby's
smoking a cigarette in there.

05:24.757 --> 05:27.992
That's weird. You only had
two dozen jalapeño poppers.

05:28.061 --> 05:31.146
- I know.
- I'll get your back.

05:31.677 --> 05:33.964
You know what, honey?

05:34.033 --> 05:36.840
I love you. I love you so much.

05:36.865 --> 05:40.560
I want to look at you
from across the room.

05:40.585 --> 05:43.674
You know, like, uh, fine art.

05:43.743 --> 05:46.677
Okay. This is, like, one
of your pregnancy things.

05:46.746 --> 05:48.079
- Yeah.
- Okay. Yeah?

05:48.147 --> 05:51.060
It's just my senses are
all out of whack, and...

05:51.085 --> 05:52.824
You can tell me. I can take it.

05:52.849 --> 05:54.385
- You sure? Okay.
- Yeah.

05:54.454 --> 05:57.028
Um, well, it's your nose breath.

05:57.802 --> 05:58.933
My what, now?

05:58.958 --> 06:01.398
You know the air that comes out
of your nose when you breathe?

06:01.461 --> 06:04.662
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah. It makes me want to vomit.

06:05.240 --> 06:07.665
Lucky for me, I have
another hole I can use.

06:07.734 --> 06:09.630
Okay.

06:17.412 --> 06:20.074
I'm sorry, is there a
third option? So sorry.

06:20.099 --> 06:22.057
Don't be. All right? I can,
I can take it, all right?

06:22.081 --> 06:24.448
What, what else bothers you, sweetness?

06:24.517 --> 06:27.828
Um, the way you say your S's.

06:27.853 --> 06:29.820
Just kind of really makes the food

06:29.845 --> 06:32.130
want to come-come out and party.

06:33.832 --> 06:35.088
Hey, honey?

06:35.113 --> 06:36.553
What happened to my yogurt?

06:36.578 --> 06:38.111
Oh, I threw it away.

06:38.179 --> 06:40.113
It was just the word. Ugh.

06:41.409 --> 06:43.683
I get it. It's a gross word.

06:43.752 --> 06:46.719
Thank you for being so understanding.

06:47.221 --> 06:48.319
Love you.

06:48.344 --> 06:49.509
Love you.

06:51.964 --> 06:53.359
It is freezing.

06:53.428 --> 06:56.195
Ugh, your pee, Greg. It is deafening.

06:56.264 --> 06:59.232
I mean, I thought you said you
were gonna pee sitting down.

06:59.301 --> 07:01.729
Well, the seat's too cold.
I'll stick to it if I sit down.

07:01.754 --> 07:03.595
It's... You know what
it is? It's the drop.

07:03.620 --> 07:05.386
Like, I think it's a distance thing.

07:05.455 --> 07:06.921
Okay, look, I don't mean to brag,

07:06.990 --> 07:08.940
but the distance between me and the bowl

07:08.965 --> 07:10.564
is about as short as it can be.

07:10.589 --> 07:12.657
Okay, what is the thermostat set at?

07:12.682 --> 07:14.329
No, hey, do not touch that.

07:14.354 --> 07:16.157
I am sweltering.

07:16.182 --> 07:17.525
Sixty-two?

07:17.550 --> 07:20.673
Oh, yeah, well, no wonder.
Can you take it down to 60?

07:20.698 --> 07:21.502
No.

07:21.571 --> 07:23.938
The A/C guy said if we do
that, the system will freeze.

07:24.007 --> 07:26.886
Well, the A/C guy
isn't having this baby.

07:26.911 --> 07:29.057
Okay, okay.

07:36.252 --> 07:38.252
Oh, honey, can you just
stop moving, though?

07:38.321 --> 07:39.954
It's making me nauseous.

07:39.979 --> 07:41.789
I'm shivering. I don't have a choice.

07:41.858 --> 07:44.439
Oh, honey, no S's.

07:45.268 --> 07:46.450
Give me some of this blanket.

07:46.475 --> 07:50.164
No, I'm so sorry, but I do
need the full weight on my body.

07:50.233 --> 07:52.214
And can you face the other way?

07:52.239 --> 07:53.835
And, Greg, don't forget the mask.

07:53.903 --> 07:55.885
Okay, that's it.

07:55.932 --> 07:57.504
I'm done, I'm done.

07:57.529 --> 08:00.274
I'm tired of being treated
like the Elephant Man.

08:00.343 --> 08:04.712
Greg, no, I only said that
when you were eating soup.

08:04.781 --> 08:06.447
Because you wouldn't let me chew.

08:06.516 --> 08:09.050
Well, you're the one who chose chowder.

08:09.118 --> 08:10.618
There's been a lot of consideration

08:10.687 --> 08:12.777
for how hard this
pregnancy's been on you,

08:12.802 --> 08:15.105
but there has been zero consideration

08:15.130 --> 08:17.013
for how hard it's been for me.

08:17.333 --> 08:19.060
I'm sorry, what?

08:19.128 --> 08:22.831
Did you say the pregnancy's
been hard for you?

08:22.856 --> 08:24.832
- Yeah.
- This pregnancy?

08:24.901 --> 08:27.802
Yes, this pregnancy, because
you get to eat whenever you want,

08:27.871 --> 08:29.558
you get to breathe however you want,

08:29.583 --> 08:31.480
and you don't have to pee sitting down.

08:31.505 --> 08:33.407
I do pee sitting down, Greg.

08:33.476 --> 08:37.886
In fact, every time I sit
down, a little bit slips out,

08:37.912 --> 08:40.913
so you're right, I've got it made.

08:41.523 --> 08:44.951
What are you doing?
What are you doing? No.

08:44.976 --> 08:47.520
No, no, no, you wouldn't.

08:47.588 --> 08:49.188
Let's see how the 50s feel.

08:50.558 --> 08:52.333
Not a fan.

08:52.358 --> 08:56.594
I'm much more a fan of the 80s...

09:01.069 --> 09:03.670
Honey? Oh!

09:03.905 --> 09:05.938
Oh, sweetie.

09:06.007 --> 09:10.017
- Oh, I am so sorry.
- Honey, no S's.

09:14.615 --> 09:15.815
Daddy home.

09:16.288 --> 09:17.960
How are my two favorite girl?

09:17.985 --> 09:20.118
Daddy, dinner's ready.

09:20.963 --> 09:22.570
Thanks, honey.

10:02.723 --> 10:04.573
_

10:04.703 --> 10:07.404
Slower, slower. Okay, the chair.

10:07.473 --> 10:10.134
The chair. Oh!

10:10.159 --> 10:11.892
Welcome home!

10:11.917 --> 10:13.310
I'm here.

10:13.379 --> 10:15.689
I'm broken, but I'm here.

10:15.714 --> 10:17.745
Your mother took her
surgery like a champ,

10:17.787 --> 10:19.954
which makes sense because
taking it like a champ

10:20.023 --> 10:22.267
is what got her into this mess.

10:22.292 --> 10:25.226
John, everybody knows I
was injured making love.

10:25.295 --> 10:26.295
Oh.

10:26.362 --> 10:28.529
- Um, listen, Mom.
- Uh-huh?

10:28.598 --> 10:31.486
You let us know whatever
we can do to help, okay?

10:31.511 --> 10:35.473
Nonsense. No, she's got all
the help she needs right here.

10:35.498 --> 10:37.038
You're gonna take care of me?

10:37.107 --> 10:38.473
Well, I'm the one who hurt you,

10:38.541 --> 10:40.541
so I'm the one who has to heal you.

10:40.610 --> 10:42.076
It's-it's jungle law.

10:42.145 --> 10:43.311
Kids,

10:43.379 --> 10:44.712
- keep on your cell.
- All right.

10:44.781 --> 10:46.931
- Keep on your cell phones.
- We got it.

10:46.956 --> 10:48.527
It's a lot harder to push
that with the brake on.

10:48.551 --> 10:50.284
- Should we tell him?
- No, no.

10:50.353 --> 10:51.586
We'd have to raise our voices,

10:51.654 --> 10:53.387
and you know how much that upsets Mom.

10:53.916 --> 10:56.118
I'm sorry that took so long.

10:56.143 --> 10:58.853
Those wheels just did not want to turn.

10:58.878 --> 11:00.143
I'm hungry.

11:00.168 --> 11:03.431
Do you think that you could
manage to make some oatmeal?

11:03.500 --> 11:05.500
Well, if I can haul you up the stairs,

11:05.568 --> 11:07.668
leave you there, go back downstairs,

11:07.737 --> 11:09.637
haul the wheelchair back up the stairs,

11:09.706 --> 11:11.973
then lift you back into it,

11:12.041 --> 11:14.909
I think I can whip up a little oatmeal.

11:18.283 --> 11:19.649
Voilà!

11:19.674 --> 11:22.836
Huh? Oatmeal à la Joanie.

11:22.861 --> 11:24.285
- Oh!
- Oh.

11:24.398 --> 11:26.831
- Did you make all this?
- Mm-hmm.

11:26.856 --> 11:28.856
Is that juice fresh-squeezed?

11:28.925 --> 11:32.445
I'd let you smell my hands,
but I got too much class.

11:34.960 --> 11:36.683
Your mother loves your food.

11:36.708 --> 11:37.741
- Oh!
- Yeah.

11:37.766 --> 11:39.975
- Thanks for being here.
- Oh, no problem, Dad.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.001
You know what? Sam told
me I looked tired today,

11:42.026 --> 11:44.305
so I'm happy to let her
walk home from school.

11:44.374 --> 11:48.111
And I hope you're also happy
to keep this on the down under.

11:48.137 --> 11:49.336
On the what?

11:49.361 --> 11:50.611
The down under.

11:50.680 --> 11:53.674
That's how the Australians
keep it on the down low.

11:53.807 --> 11:56.407
Huh. Listen, you know what,
Dad? It's not a problem.

11:56.432 --> 11:57.992
I won't say anything to Mom, okay?

11:58.017 --> 11:59.742
Just let me know when you need me.

11:59.767 --> 12:01.622
- Oh, Heather, um...
- Yeah.

12:01.993 --> 12:04.851
Your mom wanted a
strawberry smoothie and...

12:04.876 --> 12:06.726
- Oh.
- I'll take one, too.

12:06.751 --> 12:07.739
Sure, Dad.

12:07.764 --> 12:11.587
But I want mine chocolate
and more like a milkshake.

12:11.612 --> 12:12.567
Okay.

12:12.635 --> 12:14.135
But we're out of ice cream.

12:14.204 --> 12:16.767
I-I know the market has
it, so since you're there,

12:16.792 --> 12:18.005
I'll make you a list here.

12:18.405 --> 12:19.669
Okay.

12:19.694 --> 12:20.907
Oh, you also, uh,

12:20.932 --> 12:21.809
need to get some pens.

12:21.878 --> 12:24.912
- Yeah, sure, some pens.
- Mm-hmm.

12:25.995 --> 12:27.595
Bras on, Joanie.

12:27.620 --> 12:28.653
You got visitors.

12:28.722 --> 12:30.121
Oh!

12:30.190 --> 12:34.307
Kids. Oh, what lovely flowers.

12:34.332 --> 12:36.828
Aren't they gorgeous?
Tyler just got them for me.

12:36.896 --> 12:38.896
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, here.

12:41.572 --> 12:43.279
"Feel better.

12:43.617 --> 12:45.784
From us."

12:45.977 --> 12:48.244
I'll-I'll cherish this.

12:48.541 --> 12:50.208
Did you make this grilled cheese?

12:50.276 --> 12:51.976
Of course. It's easy.

12:52.045 --> 12:53.911
Well, I got laundry to do.

12:53.980 --> 12:56.451
Any change I find, I get to keep.

12:57.193 --> 12:59.851
You know, I see Pop-Pop
as a "sitting in a chair

12:59.919 --> 13:01.529
and expecting things" kind of guy,

13:01.554 --> 13:03.487
but he's really stepping up.

13:06.292 --> 13:08.326
- Something wrong?
- Gruyère.

13:08.395 --> 13:09.727
Gruyère cheese.

13:09.796 --> 13:12.168
That means he went into the market.

13:12.193 --> 13:15.433
He didn't just sit in the car,
honking the horn the whole time.

13:15.502 --> 13:17.001
I think it's really amazing

13:17.070 --> 13:19.003
that you guys still have your licenses.

13:19.072 --> 13:20.834
I can't believe this.

13:20.859 --> 13:23.615
I cook and clean for 50 years,

13:23.640 --> 13:27.578
and all the while, I'm married
to a secret Martha Stewart.

13:27.984 --> 13:30.433
Okay, Dad, the laundry's
gonna have to wait, okay?

13:30.458 --> 13:32.792
I'm working on this baked ziti for Mom.

13:32.817 --> 13:34.285
Oh, the baked ziti is for me.

13:34.354 --> 13:36.788
Uh, your mother wants Bolognese.

13:36.856 --> 13:37.856
What?

13:37.924 --> 13:40.669
Okay, the Bolognese is for me, too.

13:40.694 --> 13:43.199
I wasn't sure if I was
gonna like your ziti.

13:43.224 --> 13:45.029
- She wants a salad.
- Dad!

13:45.098 --> 13:48.032
- Okay. Skip the salad. She ate lunch.
- Okay.

13:48.101 --> 13:49.267
You know what?

13:49.335 --> 13:50.968
Let Matt and Greg deal with this.

13:51.037 --> 13:52.703
Okay? Where are they?

13:52.772 --> 13:54.693
They were supposed to relieve me.

13:54.718 --> 13:56.040
I called them off.

13:56.109 --> 13:58.276
You know, I didn't want
the food quality to drop.

13:58.344 --> 13:59.544
Which reminds me,

13:59.612 --> 14:01.649
I want to wow Joanie in the morning.

14:01.674 --> 14:03.881
You know how to make a crab Benedict?

14:03.950 --> 14:07.752
Yeah, I... oh, and your mom
probably just wants a bagel.

14:07.821 --> 14:10.788
I came here to take care
of Mom, not both of you.

14:10.857 --> 14:12.290
I'm out.

14:12.660 --> 14:15.194
Heather, I'll drive
you to the market, huh?

14:15.219 --> 14:17.264
And I promise not to honk.

14:17.289 --> 14:18.229
Heather!

14:18.298 --> 14:20.631
Who's raising their voices down there?

14:21.035 --> 14:22.768
Heather.

14:24.200 --> 14:25.229
Well,

14:25.254 --> 14:28.783
look who rode into town
with his next gourmet meal.

14:28.808 --> 14:31.637
Baked ziti à la Joanie.

14:32.832 --> 14:35.079
Uncooked pasta with ketchup.

14:35.148 --> 14:36.508
Well, sure, it may seem like that.

14:36.549 --> 14:38.816
But, actually, it's a culinary journey.

14:38.885 --> 14:41.252
First, you're a gourmet
chef and now this?

14:41.321 --> 14:42.798
Well, sounds like somebody didn't see

14:42.822 --> 14:45.089
- the uncooked hot dogs.
- Okay,

14:45.158 --> 14:47.521
I'm sleeping on a bare mattress.

14:47.546 --> 14:49.193
What is going on?

14:49.262 --> 14:52.529
Yeah, yeah, the, uh,
sheets are in the pool.

14:52.554 --> 14:55.333
I didn't know where to go from there.

14:55.401 --> 14:58.769
Oh, I got, I got a
confession to make, Joanie.

14:58.794 --> 15:01.962
All the stuff you think
that I've been doing for you,

15:01.987 --> 15:03.371
Heather's been doing it.

15:03.396 --> 15:05.357
- It was all Heather?
- Mm-hmm.

15:05.382 --> 15:09.146
You take such good care of me,
I wanted to take care of you.

15:09.215 --> 15:10.581
Are you mad?

15:10.617 --> 15:11.983
I'm thrilled!

15:12.051 --> 15:13.117
Really?

15:13.186 --> 15:14.452
All this time,

15:14.521 --> 15:17.428
I thought I was married
to somebody who was lazy.

15:17.453 --> 15:20.387
And, really, it turns out you're just...

15:20.412 --> 15:22.869
very, very incompetent.

15:22.894 --> 15:24.927
Oh, Joanie.

15:30.679 --> 15:32.600
_

15:33.907 --> 15:35.466
Okay, so this lookbook

15:35.491 --> 15:37.658
will give you a sense of who we are

15:37.727 --> 15:41.195
and, uh, the family that your
child would actually be joining.

15:41.264 --> 15:43.298
Binding it with shoelaces was my idea.

15:43.323 --> 15:44.466
- Crafty mom.
- Yeah.

15:44.491 --> 15:46.336
Ugh, this isn't sweet at all.

15:46.361 --> 15:47.994
I asked for extra drizzle.

15:48.019 --> 15:50.453
Yeah, you can... you can actually
never have too much sugar.

15:51.079 --> 15:52.220
Yep. Babies love sugar.

15:52.245 --> 15:53.899
That's what makes them so sweet.

15:53.967 --> 15:55.200
Mm.

15:55.269 --> 15:56.835
Mmm. You know what?

15:56.904 --> 15:57.981
It's actually not bad. It was my gum

15:58.005 --> 15:59.321
that was making it taste bad.

16:00.073 --> 16:01.573
That's convenient.

16:01.642 --> 16:02.841
So, uh,

16:02.910 --> 16:04.609
this is a picture from Halloween.

16:04.678 --> 16:06.389
That's actually us. I
don't know if you can tell,

16:06.413 --> 16:08.213
but we're-we're dressed
as the actual Minions.

16:08.241 --> 16:10.189
Oh, I love Halloween. It's the one night

16:10.214 --> 16:11.546
where all crime is legal.

16:11.716 --> 16:12.841
Ugh.

16:13.076 --> 16:15.040
No way, you basic B.

16:15.065 --> 16:16.985
You better watch your fat back.

16:17.010 --> 16:20.118
Is everything okay with... your basic B?

16:20.143 --> 16:22.716
She's been on my ass ever since
she found out I was pregnant.

16:22.955 --> 16:25.976
Like, come on, like my mom's
never smashed a rando, right?

16:26.045 --> 16:28.912
So, your basic B is-is
actually your mom?

16:28.937 --> 16:32.505
Yeah. And now she wants
my ex-boyfriend's number.

16:32.839 --> 16:35.106
God, I can't believe they're
gonna get back together.

16:35.131 --> 16:38.177
Anyway, I got to pee.
Being pregnant blows.

16:38.202 --> 16:40.490
You're so lucky you
can't have kids, Colleen.

16:40.559 --> 16:42.059
I feel lucky.

16:42.360 --> 16:44.061
So, so lucky.

16:47.099 --> 16:48.910
- Do you think she likes us? I can't tell.
- Oh, no, no, no.

16:48.934 --> 16:50.245
You're doing great, you're
doing great, you're doing great.

16:50.269 --> 16:51.980
I'm the one who can't
stop saying "actually."

16:52.004 --> 16:54.204
I think I've actually said
it, like, 14 times. 15.

16:54.273 --> 16:56.257
No, stop. You sound so smart.

16:56.282 --> 16:59.109
If I were pregnant, I would
totally give us my baby.

17:01.124 --> 17:02.779
Ugh, adorbs.

17:02.804 --> 17:05.872
I am so weak for you. Um, unfortunately,

17:05.983 --> 17:08.718
my next couple's early, so
you guys should probably...

17:08.787 --> 17:10.087
skedaddle.

17:10.112 --> 17:11.412
Your next couple?

17:11.522 --> 17:13.790
Bradford, Poppy. Matt and Colleen.

17:13.944 --> 17:15.692
- Hi.
- Hi.

17:15.717 --> 17:17.787
Look at the jaundice
your other children have.

17:17.811 --> 17:18.701
Oh, that's...

17:18.726 --> 17:20.763
that's actually us
dressed up as Minions.

17:20.833 --> 17:22.531
- Cute.
- Oh.

17:22.601 --> 17:24.045
- Okay.
- Yeah.

17:24.912 --> 17:26.303
- See you.
- All right.

17:26.328 --> 17:28.832
- Sorry. Excuse me.
- Thank you. Sorry. Excuse us.

17:28.932 --> 17:31.466
Well, here is our digital lookbook.

17:31.491 --> 17:33.243
I hope you don't mind it's on a tablet.

17:33.268 --> 17:34.667
Which you can keep.

17:34.780 --> 17:37.061
What? My God, thank you so much.

17:37.086 --> 17:37.975
- You're so welcome.
- What?

17:38.000 --> 17:39.071
Um, they're hugging? I'm sorry.

17:39.095 --> 17:41.070
I thought that she was weak for us.

17:44.882 --> 17:46.033
I told you

17:46.058 --> 17:47.802
we shouldn't have put the
Minions picture on the cover.

17:47.826 --> 17:50.880
We look like two Twinkies
stuffed in denim wrappers.

17:50.905 --> 17:53.440
Oh. Is that actually on me, actually?

17:53.465 --> 17:54.664
I mean, do you even know

17:54.733 --> 17:56.433
any other words in the English language?

17:56.502 --> 17:57.712
I know the word "gift."
You know, that thing

17:57.736 --> 17:58.765
that you said we shouldn't bring.

17:58.789 --> 18:00.021
Okay, look,

18:00.172 --> 18:01.649
I don't want us to turn on each other

18:01.673 --> 18:03.701
just because you screwed up so bad.

18:05.178 --> 18:06.810
Just ask Molly

18:06.879 --> 18:09.246
to give you the truck when
she's done with it, Lucas.

18:09.271 --> 18:10.415
She'll bite me.

18:10.440 --> 18:12.115
Well, then roll down your sleeves.

18:13.652 --> 18:14.985
Good luck.

18:15.053 --> 18:17.287
- Yeah, he's gonna get bit.
- Sheesh.

18:17.356 --> 18:18.421
So, I-I haven't connected

18:18.474 --> 18:20.126
with Morgan yet, but
how did your meeting go?

18:20.150 --> 18:20.899
- Mm.
- Oh, we blew it.

18:20.924 --> 18:22.170
Colleen said a whole bunch of stuff

18:22.194 --> 18:23.793
- that she totally regrets.
- Um...

18:23.862 --> 18:25.862
we both are filled with regret and rage

18:25.931 --> 18:27.084
- for one another.
- Mm-hmm.

18:27.109 --> 18:28.408
Okay. Well, that's marriage. You know,

18:28.432 --> 18:30.211
I threw a tea kettle at
my husband this morning.

18:30.235 --> 18:32.802
But I'm sure you guys did fine.

18:32.871 --> 18:35.194
Well, we didn't know that
this was a competition.

18:35.219 --> 18:37.607
We would be the perfect
parents to this little baby.

18:37.676 --> 18:39.843
We just need more time
to prove it to Morgan.

18:39.912 --> 18:41.378
I know how much this means to you,

18:41.446 --> 18:43.213
but, unfortunately,
Morgan's catching a bus

18:43.282 --> 18:44.714
back to Modesto today.

18:44.995 --> 18:46.220
The best thing you can do

18:46.245 --> 18:47.717
is be patient and wait.

18:47.786 --> 18:49.152
Ow, she bit me!

18:49.221 --> 18:50.987
All right, it begins. I'm sorry.

19:03.058 --> 19:05.992
Wh-What's up, guys? This is weird.

19:06.061 --> 19:08.094
It's actually the opposite of weird.

19:08.163 --> 19:11.076
I see how you fell into
that "actually" trap.

19:11.108 --> 19:11.942
Yep.

19:11.967 --> 19:13.533
Oh.

19:13.602 --> 19:15.580
I'm sorry, do you have beef
with my bump or something?

19:15.604 --> 19:17.148
Hey, why don't you come
say it to my face, then?

19:17.172 --> 19:18.826
- Why don't you...
- So good to see you.

19:18.851 --> 19:19.732
Yeah, it's, uh,

19:19.757 --> 19:20.952
- it's good to see you guys, too.
- Yeah.

19:20.976 --> 19:22.900
Yeah, our conversation
got cut short earlier.

19:22.925 --> 19:24.878
We just didn't get a
chance to give you our gift.

19:24.946 --> 19:27.940
- We made you a new lookbook.
- Oh.

19:28.463 --> 19:30.555
Wow, this is, um...

19:30.580 --> 19:31.938
I don't get it. This is blank.

19:31.963 --> 19:34.221
Am I supposed to be, like,
blind to read this or something?

19:34.245 --> 19:36.702
No, no, no, no. It's
supposed to be blank.

19:37.266 --> 19:38.710
We got to talking about the lookbook

19:38.735 --> 19:39.884
that we gave you before,

19:39.909 --> 19:43.095
and that's just pictures
of us before having a baby.

19:43.120 --> 19:44.720
And what we really want you to see

19:44.745 --> 19:47.141
is what our lives are gonna
look like with the baby.

19:47.166 --> 19:49.866
If you pick us, we will fill
that book with amazing photos

19:49.891 --> 19:51.657
of the life that baby will have.

19:51.726 --> 19:54.794
I'm sorry, I really just don't
feel comfortable taking this.

19:55.307 --> 19:56.595
- Okay.
- Okay.

19:56.664 --> 19:58.208
I don't know, it's just kind of stupid.

19:58.232 --> 19:59.777
You already gave me a lookbook

19:59.801 --> 20:02.201
with you guys as Minions
on it, and I loved that.

20:02.236 --> 20:04.246
- You did?
- I, uh,

20:04.271 --> 20:05.905
I saw that movie with my dad.

20:05.973 --> 20:07.973
And I don't really have a
lot of memories with him,

20:08.042 --> 20:10.943
so that's my favorite one.

20:11.012 --> 20:12.678
That's so sweet.

20:12.747 --> 20:14.242
When I saw you guys
dressed up like that,

20:14.266 --> 20:16.138
looking all stupid and stuff,

20:16.181 --> 20:19.032
it kind of just felt like maybe
it was a sign or something.

20:19.203 --> 20:22.231
You know, that this whole
mess that I got myself into...

20:22.928 --> 20:24.232
maybe it was meant to be,

20:24.257 --> 20:26.017
and that this...

20:26.061 --> 20:28.193
this thing belongs with you.

20:28.237 --> 20:31.109
With us? You're picking us?

20:31.153 --> 20:32.889
Yeah!

20:32.925 --> 20:34.332
- No, no, no. Don't cry. Don't cry.
- No.

20:34.356 --> 20:35.520
- We don't...
- Okay, yeah. Never.

20:35.544 --> 20:37.435
My bus is gonna leave soon,
so I should probably get going.

20:37.459 --> 20:39.219
Maybe I can just move in with
you guys on, like, Saturday

20:39.243 --> 20:40.435
- or something like that?
- Yeah.

20:40.459 --> 20:42.932
And... crap. My rats
can't ride the bus with me.

20:42.957 --> 20:44.855
- Rats. Rats, rats, rats.
- It's some sort of legal thing.

20:44.879 --> 20:47.276
But we'll figure that out later.
Thank you so much.Yeah. Bye.

20:47.300 --> 20:48.862
- Okay, bye.
- Bye.

20:50.401 --> 20:52.039
We're having a baby.

20:52.940 --> 20:54.816
I am so weak for you.
