And it's got the middle piece
that goes with it!

31:59.860 --> 32:01.893
I didn't know that that ring
went with anything

32:01.929 --> 32:03.895
until I saw the other two pieces.

32:03.931 --> 32:05.897
Where did you find it?

32:05.933 --> 32:08.000
Well, my father had it,

32:08.035 --> 32:10.869
but it was almost lost forever.

32:12.606 --> 32:14.740

32:46.364 --> 32:47.806
But the jeweler said

32:47.841 --> 32:49.708
he would never sell it
because it meant so much to him.

32:49.743 --> 32:52.310
Which is why I had
to find the one thing he wants

32:52.346 --> 32:55.380
more than anything else:
The one thing that maybe

32:55.416 --> 32:59.217
<i>- he would trade the ring for.</i>
- How did you get that open?

32:59.253 --> 33:01.153
I worked on that as often as I could,

33:01.188 --> 33:03.155

thought about me.
