27:15.360 --> 27:17.110
it's just something I'm working on

27:17.500 --> 27:19.110
don't think you'd understand

27:19.360 --> 27:20.930
oh, yeah, try me!

27:25.050 --> 27:27.560

with girl form "forgetting sarah marshall"

27:31.720 --> 27:32.510
what's it about?

27:32.510 --> 27:36.820
well, in this one Veronica teams up with pchers
and they uncover murder mystery

27:36.820 --> 27:38.420
and she fell in love with vivle

27:38.440 --> 27:40.090
it's silly, but, I really like it

27:40.970 --> 27:42.540

27:52.540 --> 27:55.160
so I just call you for my scooter?

27:57.000 --> 27:58.430
I should just get your number

27:58.530 --> 28:01.530

I just lost my phone earlier today, so

28:35.870 --> 28:36.970
she's a hard worker

28:36.970 --> 28:39.560
she's early everyday and she stays late every night

28:39.830 --> 28:41.270
she's your f'ing anchor

28:41.270 --> 28:42.880
you need watch it, we've got families here

28:42.900 --> 28:44.880
you know we had the highest sales of the year, last month

28:44.880 --> 28:48.020
are you gonna ignore that
are you gonna ignore the quarterly reports?

28:48.020 --> 28:49.630
you know what, if you fire her.

28:49.630 --> 28:51.630
you're gonna have to fire me too.

28:54.080 --> 28:56.070
I'm so sorry, I really thought that was gonna work.

28:56.430 --> 28:58.970
if it's any help, I'm pretty sure I'm getting fired on Monday

29:00.500 --> 29:01.980
how that would be any help?

29:03.170 --> 29:04.610
I don't know how I'm going to pay my rent.

29:04.610 --> 29:06.610
don't know how you're gonna fix my scooter.

29:07.980 --> 29:08.960
scrat...???

29:09.880 --> 29:10.960
yo, many dude?

29:10.960 --> 29:12.960
what can I do for you?
-are you here for business?

29:14.210 --> 29:16.490
oh I am not really ice cream vendor

29:16.630 --> 29:18.490
sorry, that's a bit misleading

29:19.230 --> 29:20.950
you sitting outside of ice cream truck.

29:21.430 --> 29:22.770
why don't you guys selling?

29:23.670 --> 29:24.370
yeah

29:25.490 --> 29:26.450
why aren't we selling?

29:33.680 --> 29:34.970
ice cream for sale.

29:35.110 --> 29:36.220
push pop.

29:37.620 --> 29:39.460
yeah, there you go.

30:37.950 --> 30:39.100
right

30:40.120 --> 30:42.920
you know, boo, we're there.

30:42.930 --> 30:45.440
there you go, ms Patrick, you stay at school.

30:47.810 --> 30:48.590
so, how do we do?

30:49.510 --> 30:51.090
thinking about 98 dollars

30:51.590 --> 30:54.410
so, five more days like this and
we should be able to repair my scooter

30:54.700 --> 30:57.140
you know you're a pretty good ice cream salesman

30:57.140 --> 30:59.140
do you need an assistant?

30:59.400 --> 31:00.920
I would love an assistant

31:01.840 --> 31:03.510
if this was my real job.

31:03.510 --> 31:04.900
but it's not

31:05.250 --> 31:06.080
um

31:07.020 --> 31:08.530
I supposed to detail a car today.

31:08.980 --> 31:09.990
and it got stolen

31:10.010 --> 31:13.190
and I was like panicking and freaked out, so I stole this truck

31:13.470 --> 31:15.710
I'm pretty sure the person who stole

31:15.900 --> 31:16.950
my car

31:17.200 --> 31:19.410
was the same guy driving this truck
does that makes sense?

31:20.420 --> 31:21.960
so you're a screw-up and a thief

31:21.960 --> 31:23.690
yeah, just like a little bit, though

31:24.960 --> 31:25.690
oaky

31:26.480 --> 31:28.020
why don't we team up anyway?

31:28.680 --> 31:31.000
we can sell some ice cream and
I'll help you find the car

31:31.270 --> 31:33.780
I mean you don't have to do that
I can just drop you at your house

31:33.810 --> 31:36.620
no, honestly, that's the last place I wanna be right now

31:36.890 --> 31:39.580
plus I've seen every episode of Veronica Mars
so I'm pretty well prepared

31:39.580 --> 31:40.410
okay

31:40.940 --> 31:41.540
okay

31:42.460 --> 31:45.540
so you said the guy that stole your car, was driving this ice cream truck

31:46.270 --> 31:47.480
yeah, I'm pretty sure

31:47.490 --> 31:49.690
why don't we go to his house and paying a little visit

31:50.370 --> 31:53.040
okay, that's fine and dandy, but, how do you know where he lives

31:55.850 --> 31:58.460
oh this house matches the ice cream truck pretty well

31:58.460 --> 31:59.730
yeah, I think we found the fit

32:03.480 --> 32:04.520
Deven

32:05.340 --> 32:08.260
uh, yes, sorry, we're

32:08.560 --> 32:11.330
looking for devon, have you seen him?

32:11.330 --> 32:12.290
I haven't seen him

32:13.240 --> 32:14.780
he's six dated years

32:15.010 --> 32:16.090
are you blind?

32:16.090 --> 32:17.040

32:22.050 --> 32:23.430

32:23.430 --> 32:26.470
yeah, I don't think we're gonna do that
can you just tell us where's devon is, please?

32:26.480 --> 32:29.940
I'm not telling you anything unless, you do something

34:30.070 --> 34:31.320
he used to sell ice cream

34:31.460 --> 34:32.800

34:32.800 --> 34:33.880

34:34.120 --> 34:35.710
I think I know this one

34:35.800 --> 34:38.889

35:01.600 --> 35:03.110

35:05.020 --> 35:07.020
and he's two setps away from home, yeah, but

35:07.020 --> 35:08.840
he's definitely not blind

35:09.170 --> 35:11.810
you're lucky I didn't call the cops for stealing my ice cream truck

35:12.210 --> 35:14.880
yeah, why didn't anybody call the cops?

35:15.150 --> 35:17.100

35:39.280 --> 35:40.860
was the same dude stole my car

35:41.100 --> 35:42.170

35:45.250 --> 35:46.310
how is that shit adds up?

35:46.360 --> 35:48.980

35:50.180 --> 35:51.780

I've had since I was 16 years old

35:56.120 --> 35:58.850

45:10.350 --> 45:12.350
that's my smoking apparatus

45:12.470 --> 45:14.540
it's taking me over 11 years to acquire

45:15.010 --> 45:16.340
it's pretty beautiful, uh?

45:17.690 --> 45:18.820
I wouldn't really know

45:19.060 --> 45:19.490
[blows raspberry]

45:19.800 --> 45:20.340
but

45:20.710 --> 45:21.270
[blows]

45:21.560 --> 45:23.350
are you telling me you're a hip chick?

45:23.520 --> 45:24.980
who writes fan fiction

45:24.980 --> 45:26.260
in a leather bound journal

45:26.260 --> 45:28.680
that used to work at this coffee shop
has never smoke pot

45:28.910 --> 45:30.940
I never smoked anything, okay?

45:31.600 --> 45:32.860
I mean, I just didn't

45:33.020 --> 45:36.000
ride with those type of social circles, you know.

45:36.740 --> 45:37.300
uh

45:38.600 --> 45:39.400
what's it like?

45:39.940 --> 45:40.520
[coughs]

45:41.080 --> 45:42.380
I'll give you a crash course

45:52.080 --> 45:53.070
oh, hi there

45:53.690 --> 45:55.850
this is a bud of marijuana

45:55.850 --> 45:57.840
for centuries mankind has worked

45:57.840 --> 46:00.100
to create purest strains with the most

46:00.100 --> 46:01.410
vivid highs

46:01.690 --> 46:03.500
now although there's at least complex

46:03.500 --> 46:06.370
joints probably most iconic smoking method

46:06.370 --> 46:08.370
without getting even burn you gotta break up the bud

46:08.640 --> 46:10.370
and to do that, I'd like to use

46:11.070 --> 46:11.960
a grinder

46:13.630 --> 46:16.280
now, before I was old enough to buy bulnsir???

46:16.480 --> 46:18.620
papers I was using a couple low tech method

46:19.960 --> 46:22.500
apples are the tasty way to smoke

46:22.680 --> 46:23.800
but it could be awkward

46:24.180 --> 46:27.380
as alternative, some kid smoking out of cans

46:30.540 --> 46:31.700
then we have our glassware

46:31.700 --> 46:34.340
the cornerstone in every smokers collection

46:34.340 --> 46:36.340
the possibilities are endless

46:36.820 --> 46:37.820
this includes

46:39.000 --> 46:39.820
bongs

46:39.980 --> 46:41.820
and, uh, ooh

46:42.250 --> 46:43.250
pipes

46:43.460 --> 46:45.250
and, um, uh

46:45.750 --> 46:47.240
bubblers

46:48.820 --> 46:50.480
um, what's a bubbler?

46:50.760 --> 46:52.340
that's very good question.

46:52.560 --> 46:54.820
it's bong pipe hydrator.

46:54.820 --> 46:55.970
very effective

46:56.040 --> 46:58.210
just don't rest it on his side

47:02.170 --> 47:05.120
with most glass pieces you have to work the carburetor

47:05.280 --> 47:07.500
this little hole let's you expire an oxygen

47:07.500 --> 47:10.000
to get just a perfect amount of burn

47:11.880 --> 47:14.830
if you looking to biggest height of weed conservation ratio

47:15.000 --> 47:16.940
the waterfall method worth to gander

47:24.200 --> 47:25.220
perfect suction

47:27.000 --> 47:28.280
then we get our high tech stuff

47:28.500 --> 47:29.810
like a vaporizer

47:30.000 --> 47:33.110
it vaporize the pot so breath pure THC

47:34.080 --> 47:35.710
quick high, no smoke

47:37.310 --> 47:37.920
wow

47:38.410 --> 47:40.340
you know a lot about stuff.

47:41.010 --> 47:43.230
so you think you wanna try some?

47:44.170 --> 47:45.520
uh, it's tempting

47:45.520 --> 47:47.260
but no I'm good

47:47.260 --> 47:49.860
c'mon, don't you do something about wanting to go on an adventure

47:49.890 --> 47:50.880
and try new things

47:50.990 --> 47:52.290
yeah, but

47:52.890 --> 47:55.530
but, this is the opportunity to try something new

47:55.760 --> 47:57.200
c'mon pick a piece

47:58.870 --> 48:00.380
well, the bubbler was kinda cute.

48:07.880 --> 48:09.500
-alright, you ready
-um

48:10.020 --> 48:11.500
just breathe in

48:16.260 --> 48:17.680
alright, now hold in

48:18.440 --> 48:19.680
and exhale

48:20.490 --> 48:21.300
[coughs] oh, man

48:23.430 --> 48:24.780
the taste's weird

48:25.130 --> 48:26.640
you're feeling it yet?

48:27.870 --> 48:29.360
I heard it doesn't work the first time

48:29.600 --> 48:31.460
oh, you're wrong girl

48:50.230 --> 48:51.860
we want you at biggerday

48:51.860 --> 48:53.360
you can get out ever

48:53.360 --> 48:55.360
stuck here for life

48:55.360 --> 48:57.360
it's true

48:57.990 --> 48:59.340
gotta go with that

49:09.190 --> 49:10.780
did you see that?

49:11.800 --> 49:14.800
this was a unique experience for Veronica

49:15.390 --> 49:17.060
an agent of danger

49:17.440 --> 49:19.060
a mistress of mayhem

49:19.060 --> 49:21.060
she's a bad bitch

49:21.060 --> 49:22.100
can't mess with her

49:22.100 --> 49:24.960
what if? need blue pen

49:25.280 --> 49:26.710
is you blue eyes

49:26.910 --> 49:28.720
oh yeah

49:36.020 --> 49:38.040
it is so amazing

49:38.140 --> 49:41.130
you thought to be professional, like a

49:42.400 --> 49:44.330
professional guitar player

49:44.330 --> 49:46.330
had she ever been in love

49:46.330 --> 49:49.200
it's female a fanciable fiction

49:50.870 --> 49:51.920
has she?

49:52.130 --> 49:53.280
we don't know?

49:57.790 --> 49:59.170
oh wait

49:59.510 --> 50:00.880
I got something

50:00.900 --> 50:03.260
you're gonna flip the shit over

50:04.080 --> 50:04.960
wait

50:05.470 --> 50:06.960
wait, wait, wait,

50:07.400 --> 50:09.960
we've forgotten about our internet research

50:27.750 --> 50:29.240
strawberry

50:31.800 --> 50:33.240
amazing

51:13.990 --> 51:16.360
it's funny how it takes only one event for the world to change

51:17.000 --> 51:19.200
Pearl Harbor, the San Francisco earthquake

51:19.360 --> 51:21.290
and canceling bob sponge square pants

51:21.360 --> 51:23.150
it's only altered the course of human history

51:23.660 --> 51:25.040
this may sound disastrous

51:25.300 --> 51:26.840
but as we saw all with Oliver and Megan

51:27.000 --> 51:28.170
the greatest adversities

51:28.390 --> 51:29.830
can lead to new opportunities

51:44.370 --> 51:45.130
good morning

51:45.270 --> 51:46.910
oh, moring

51:47.420 --> 51:48.910
you sleep like a bear

51:49.180 --> 51:50.580
I don't mean a hibernating one

51:50.580 --> 51:52.580
you make all sorta growly noises

51:53.580 --> 51:55.200
what happened last night

51:55.260 --> 51:56.960
we climbed the Himalaya's, made out

51:57.060 --> 51:58.670
watched "Donald Duck mathland"

51:58.750 --> 52:00.390
you drew this picture of us

52:00.560 --> 52:03.680
you did must of work but I did sharpie on the boobies

52:06.160 --> 52:08.990
so what? John G

52:09.350 --> 52:10.860
raped and murdered my

52:10.860 --> 52:12.320
wife on my chest

52:12.320 --> 52:14.740
that was me, I did really like the movie "memento"

52:14.990 --> 52:16.980
but, it was really hard to write backwards

52:16.980 --> 52:19.030
so I just went for the standard variation

52:20.740 --> 52:23.120
okay, where are my cloths and why does it smell weird in here?

52:23.420 --> 52:24.490
oh, yeah

52:24.490 --> 52:26.280
you decided to take all cloths off

52:26.280 --> 52:28.280
and rub icey huddle??? of your body

52:28.280 --> 52:30.280
you're passed out truly there after

52:30.390 --> 52:31.620
oh my god

52:32.020 --> 52:33.470
did we had sex?

52:34.000 --> 52:34.860
no

52:35.580 --> 52:36.400
wait

52:37.140 --> 52:38.120
was that an option?

52:39.240 --> 52:41.340
remind me to never smoke weed ever again

52:41.640 --> 52:42.480
noted

52:42.600 --> 52:43.720
but, check this out

52:44.160 --> 52:47.020
I went on inter-webs and type all seeing eye tattoo

52:47.040 --> 52:49.310
aux nard into google and I found this chick

52:49.670 --> 52:51.780

53:04.210 --> 53:05.770

53:05.770 --> 53:08.580
we didn't not handle that situation in appropriate fashion

54:15.050 --> 54:17.050
I don't wait for no man bitch.

54:18.020 --> 54:19.860
I've been eating doughnuts

54:19.910 --> 54:21.640
since I was a child

54:21.820 --> 54:23.640
I'm still in front of your house right now

54:24.330 --> 54:26.150
and it's 8:30 and you're not here

54:26.160 --> 54:27.120

54:43.460 --> 54:44.860
it's about last night, isn't it?

54:46.000 --> 54:46.710
no

54:48.100 --> 54:49.680
this is about my ex-boyfriend

54:49.780 --> 54:51.140
he keeps calling

54:51.160 --> 54:53.680
apparently last night he camped outside my apartment

54:53.790 --> 54:55.350
that dude's super intense

54:55.490 --> 54:56.210
yeah

54:58.860 --> 54:59.860
so funny, I

55:00.600 --> 55:03.420
have all these fiends that are getting marred and having babies

55:03.770 --> 55:06.270
but I was with Billy for 7 years

55:06.730 --> 55:08.900
never thought I would settle down with him

55:09.430 --> 55:10.990
should have broken up with him a log time ago

55:10.990 --> 55:12.790
this whole thing pretty much my fault

55:12.880 --> 55:13.760
hey

55:14.050 --> 55:17.100
screw that guy, I mean at least you broke it off before it was to late

55:17.730 --> 55:20.400
can you imagine making that decision
after you had a mini-Megan

55:20.820 --> 55:21.760
like my parents

55:23.880 --> 55:24.920
you know what? Oliver

55:25.860 --> 55:28.420
you're not merely as much good as you pretend to be

55:28.760 --> 55:29.780

55:30.840 --> 55:31.700

55:35.360 --> 55:37.590
ooh, alright you can have it. that's fine

55:43.430 --> 55:44.960
I bet Oliver call a hooker after

55:44.980 --> 55:46.740
he saw us working last night

55:46.740 --> 55:48.420
no, I don't think so

55:48.610 --> 55:50.310
she didn't look like a pro to me

55:50.520 --> 55:53.250
what, are you kidding? did you see that tattoo on her chest

55:53.500 --> 55:55.190
oh was that __her?

55:55.720 --> 55:57.100
or, just she woke up.

55:57.680 --> 55:59.210
and Oliver said he didn't sleep with her

55:59.210 --> 56:01.880
um, ofcource he didn't, that kid's a pussy

56:04.110 --> 56:04.880
you know

56:05.030 --> 56:06.340
I don't appreciate you saying that

56:06.340 --> 56:08.760
I mean he's good kid, he's just a little lost right now

56:12.510 --> 56:14.380
you know what? you're right.

56:14.680 --> 56:17.330
I think we just we had to as we agreed you know

56:17.330 --> 56:19.080
help Oliver gets on his feet

56:19.230 --> 56:21.590
and Tuscan is the bright place to spread his wings

56:22.360 --> 56:24.690
and once he's moved out

56:25.060 --> 56:27.440
you and I can have the house to ourselves

56:28.020 --> 56:30.280

do you have any of idea of street value of this?

01:00:59.980 --> 01:01:01.030

01:01:27.630 --> 01:01:28.560
[barfing]

01:01:29.840 --> 01:01:32.220
strawberry cream sekum???

01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:34.060

01:01:34.840 --> 01:01:36.210
I have just a thing

01:01:39.190 --> 01:01:40.210
so

01:01:40.210 --> 01:01:43.360
I was think that we start with disaster of garage

01:01:43.360 --> 01:01:45.760
maybe lay out some yoga mat

01:01:46.060 --> 01:01:49.110
put some pins on the walls, maybe a few mirrors

01:01:49.360 --> 01:01:51.980
make it like a little work out room

01:01:52.600 --> 01:01:53.260
sure

01:01:53.520 --> 01:01:54.880
do you remember my firend, Mary

01:01:54.980 --> 01:01:56.590
well, she makes these wine racks

01:01:56.590 --> 01:01:59.270
and I think there would be a super cute on a wine cellar

01:01:59.490 --> 01:02:00.920
wait, which one is that?

01:02:00.920 --> 01:02:02.790

no, witch room is the wine cellar

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:11.190
wow, I was thinking that we could covert your office into a wine cellar

01:02:11.540 --> 01:02:14.480
make it like cool dark cave, with moodlights

01:02:14.650 --> 01:02:17.360
I just think it's completely sad and dull as it is

01:02:17.800 --> 01:02:19.160
reminds me of work

01:02:20.450 --> 01:02:21.770
what do you say we jump into the pool

01:02:22.100 --> 01:02:23.310
I'm laying out

01:02:23.310 --> 01:02:25.850
you can't take break from chair for a second and jump in the pool?

01:02:26.080 --> 01:02:27.570

I just don't understand why we're hanging out together

01:02:41.680 --> 01:02:43.680
we can't enjoy ourself and jump in the pool?

01:02:43.980 --> 01:02:46.600

01:03:17.030 --> 01:03:18.840
why don't you go dry off your money maker?

01:03:24.590 --> 01:03:26.480
are you sure Benson gave us the right address?

01:03:26.990 --> 01:03:29.230

01:03:29.980 --> 01:03:30.980

I should be fighting crime under influence

01:03:38.030 --> 01:03:39.840
wait, wait, what are you doing?

01:03:40.580 --> 01:03:43.520

01:03:56.550 --> 01:03:59.480
it's time, expecting unexpected, we have to catch him off guard

01:04:02.880 --> 01:04:04.860
you shouldn't knock on front door, it's pretty standard

01:04:04.860 --> 01:04:06.860
good point, maybe sticking around back trying find an open window

01:04:06.860 --> 01:04:09.450
it's not what I meant, I mean we're trespassing now

01:04:09.680 --> 01:04:11.240

01:06:20.850 --> 01:06:22.120
the gun wasn't loaded

01:06:23.390 --> 01:06:24.480
you're ridiculous

01:06:24.480 --> 01:06:28.990
you put people in danger and you don't take responsibility for your actions

01:06:29.320 --> 01:06:31.320

01:06:31.500 --> 01:06:33.600

I have such high tolerance I probably
smoke like a pound to be fully functional

01:06:41.070 --> 01:06:42.790
let me ask you a question Oliver

01:06:43.960 --> 01:06:46.110

they didn't even get me updated pages

01:08:12.880 --> 01:08:14.400

01:08:28.819 --> 01:08:31.040

01:09:23.200 --> 01:09:25.000
had a lot of success in Tuscan

01:09:25.430 --> 01:09:29.109

01:09:29.109 --> 01:09:30.310

01:09:38.960 --> 01:09:40.569

01:10:01.850 --> 01:10:04.350
I generally try not to dispense advise on the couch

01:10:04.610 --> 01:10:06.800
it's sort of breach-er protocol

01:10:07.160 --> 01:10:09.710
but I think I can help you so, making an exception

01:10:10.760 --> 01:10:12.080
here's some advice

01:10:12.160 --> 01:10:14.410
one, find out what that woman wants

01:10:14.880 --> 01:10:16.800

01:10:17.630 --> 01:10:19.240

it's time for me to blast off

01:10:28.720 --> 01:10:30.940
