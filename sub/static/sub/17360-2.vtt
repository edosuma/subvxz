00:13.931 --> 00:16.474
Farah, I need help, please.

00:16.475 --> 00:18.143
Where are you?

00:18.144 --> 00:20.228
I'm at the Ridgely Building
in Springsborough--

00:20.229 --> 00:21.438
What are you doing there?

00:21.439 --> 00:22.897
I'm sorry.

00:22.898 --> 00:24.149
I snuck out.

00:24.150 --> 00:25.316
I'm in trouble.

00:25.317 --> 00:26.317
<i>Please hurry.</i>

00:26.318 --> 00:29.070
Okay, I'm on my way.

00:29.071 --> 00:31.990
Lydia, what kind of trouble
are you in?

00:31.991 --> 00:34.075
<i>Farah, don't it's a--</i>

00:34.076 --> 00:35.077
Lydia!

00:35.453 --> 00:36.746
Lydia!

00:51.010 --> 00:52.053
Not good.

00:54.096 --> 00:55.347
Not good at all.

01:18.245 --> 01:20.121
Of course.

01:20.122 --> 01:21.372
Of course, of course,
of course, of course.

01:21.373 --> 01:22.999
Nice!
Okay. A mouse, I'm a mouse.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.000
Stupid mouse.

01:24.001 --> 01:26.211
I really think someone
should open up this door right now.

01:26.212 --> 01:27.505
Someone should open up--

01:31.592 --> 01:33.552
Open this door.

01:35.262 --> 01:38.390
I need you to open this door
right now.

01:41.268 --> 01:43.562
<i>Right...now.</i>

02:00.663 --> 02:03.332
Not... to... day!

02:14.343 --> 02:17.595
<i>Farah. Help me, Farah.</i>

02:17.596 --> 02:19.140
<i>Farah, help me.</i>

02:48.419 --> 02:51.129
Patrick Spring.

02:51.130 --> 02:53.506
Crazy to see it up close, right?

02:53.507 --> 02:54.425
So much money, and then...

02:57.052 --> 02:58.470
Where's the head?

03:00.097 --> 03:01.514
We're keeping it separate.

03:01.515 --> 03:04.184
<i>You can see it if you'd like.</i>

03:04.185 --> 03:06.394
<i>Didn't you say you were
from Missing Persons?</i>

03:06.395 --> 03:08.438
I thought this was a Major Crimes case.

03:08.439 --> 03:10.940
Lydia Spring is a missing person.

03:10.941 --> 03:11.816
That's our case.

03:11.817 --> 03:13.944
- Her father's death fits in.
- Can you prove that?

03:15.404 --> 03:16.696
Soon.

03:16.697 --> 03:17.614
Where are the other two bodies?

03:17.615 --> 03:19.449
- Other two bodies?
- From the crime scene.

03:19.450 --> 03:20.950
The tattooed men,
one was bitten in half.

03:20.951 --> 03:22.327
Oh, they're gone.

03:22.328 --> 03:24.329
Two human corpses are gone?

03:24.330 --> 03:25.538
<i>Well, they're not here.</i>

03:25.539 --> 03:26.998
They haven't stopped existing.

03:26.999 --> 03:28.917
Oh. Okay.

03:28.918 --> 03:31.461
Where are they existing currently?

03:31.462 --> 03:34.130
I think they were just transferred out
to an FBI lab this morning

03:34.131 --> 03:35.006
for testing.

03:35.007 --> 03:36.549
<i>Something to do with the weapon.</i>

03:36.550 --> 03:38.760
Yeah. Yeah.
We were wondering about that.

03:38.761 --> 03:41.387
Yeah, some sort of chomping device,

03:41.388 --> 03:42.430
a saw or something?

03:42.431 --> 03:45.433
The bite wounds are a match
to the teeth of an adult specimen

03:45.434 --> 03:47.894
of Sphyrna mokarran.

03:47.895 --> 03:49.063
Sfeerna mokoron?

03:50.648 --> 03:51.774
What the hell is that?

03:51.857 --> 03:53.775
<i>The Great Hammerhead Shark.</i>

03:53.776 --> 03:56.277
A hammerhead shark
killed Patrick Spring?

03:56.278 --> 03:57.403
How is that possible?

03:57.404 --> 03:59.405
<i>Yes, it's interesting,
because hammerhead sharks</i>

03:59.406 --> 04:01.282
<i>aren't usually aggressive
towards humans.</i>

04:01.283 --> 04:03.368
Yeah, and they aren't
generally found in hotel rooms.

04:03.369 --> 04:05.578
Right? That too!

04:05.579 --> 04:07.330
It was good of you to contact me, Todd.

04:07.331 --> 04:09.082
Excellent work as my assistant.

04:09.083 --> 04:10.250
I'm not your assistant.

04:10.251 --> 04:12.335
And yet, here you are, assisting.

04:12.336 --> 04:14.337
I just--

04:14.338 --> 04:15.964
what you said
about things being connected,

04:15.965 --> 04:18.091
it just seemed like
the right thing to do.

04:18.092 --> 04:22.095
And you're certain the person you saw
was Lydia Spring?

04:22.096 --> 04:23.972
Yeah, I am. I'm sure.

04:23.973 --> 04:26.140
Then perhaps you'll admit,
solely for my edification,

04:26.141 --> 04:28.268
that there is another connection,
however evanescent,

04:28.269 --> 04:30.812
between you, me,
and the Patrick Spring murder case?

04:30.813 --> 04:34.107
I mean, surely,
her disappearance and his murder

04:34.108 --> 04:35.900
- shortly thereafter--
- I just found a dog.

04:35.901 --> 04:37.277
I don't think it means anything.

04:37.278 --> 04:38.528
Look, I have to go. Okay?

04:38.529 --> 04:39.529
Why are you in such a rush?

04:39.530 --> 04:41.699
You're unemployed. Technically.

04:46.453 --> 04:48.955
I, um...

04:48.956 --> 04:50.415
found something.

04:50.416 --> 04:52.917
In the hotel. It's a--

04:52.918 --> 04:54.043
What am I doing?
Why am I doing this?

04:54.044 --> 04:57.880
What is--
Is that a lottery ticket?

04:57.881 --> 05:01.217
Yeah, okay, I found it, and--

05:01.218 --> 05:02.302
Is that blood on it?

05:02.303 --> 05:03.636
No.

05:03.637 --> 05:06.264
- Maybe. I don't know.
- And is it a winner?

05:06.265 --> 05:07.515
Yes.

05:08.684 --> 05:10.351
It's only for 10 grand.

05:10.352 --> 05:12.186
I can pay for Amanda's medication.

05:12.187 --> 05:14.981
I can fix my apartment, my car...

05:14.982 --> 05:16.983
I can... try and start to... fix things.

05:16.984 --> 05:19.527
And you seriously think
that's just a coincidence?

05:19.528 --> 05:20.570
I told you

05:20.571 --> 05:22.947
the universe would congratulate you
for helping me solve

05:22.948 --> 05:24.032
the Patrick Spring murder case.

05:24.033 --> 05:26.701
Are you taking credit
for me finding a lottery ticket?

05:26.702 --> 05:27.910
No, it's just a coincidence.

05:27.911 --> 05:28.828
But you just said--

05:31.206 --> 05:32.875
Goddammit!

05:41.091 --> 05:44.177
<i>That's the man? The... guy?</i>

05:44.178 --> 05:45.471
That's him, yeah.

05:46.347 --> 05:48.140
Well, he doesn't look so tough.

05:49.266 --> 05:52.435
I've got a good feeling about this.

05:52.436 --> 05:54.228
About what?

05:54.229 --> 05:55.646
Shouldn't we call the police? I mean--

05:55.647 --> 05:56.523
Here, quick, give me the lottery ticket.

05:58.192 --> 06:00.652
Hey! What the-- Hey!

06:02.696 --> 06:03.655
Hey!

06:22.883 --> 06:24.343
What happened?

06:26.595 --> 06:28.013
The car turned off.

06:29.973 --> 06:31.683
You're not gonna try and fix it?

06:35.020 --> 06:38.564
If the car turned off here,
this is where the car turned off.

06:38.565 --> 06:40.984
I'm sure it'll start up again
when it's meant to.

06:44.154 --> 06:45.738
Cars are like that,

06:45.739 --> 06:47.949
always turning off and on again,

06:47.950 --> 06:49.535
breaking down,
and then fixing themselves.

06:51.954 --> 06:53.163
No, they aren't.

07:04.716 --> 07:06.176
Buddy, get out.

07:17.896 --> 07:19.690
How come nobody's come looking for you?

07:21.400 --> 07:22.859
What?

07:22.860 --> 07:25.403
I have your phone, remember?

07:25.404 --> 07:28.030
Nobody's called.
It's been over a day now.

07:28.031 --> 07:29.241
Someone will call.

07:34.163 --> 07:35.538
Oh, yeah? Who?

07:35.539 --> 07:38.374
My...

07:38.375 --> 07:39.250
girlfriend.

07:41.420 --> 07:42.462
Right. Her.

07:42.463 --> 07:43.797
She seems real.

07:45.466 --> 07:47.258
<i>Who was that?</i>

07:47.259 --> 07:49.427
Who was that guy
with the tats and the shotgun

07:49.428 --> 07:51.179
that I killed at the power station?

07:51.180 --> 07:53.764
- What were you doing there?
- Why are you doing this to me?

07:53.765 --> 07:55.142
Doing this to you?

08:01.523 --> 08:02.690
Answer the question.

08:02.691 --> 08:05.485
Who was the guy that I killed
at the power station?

08:05.486 --> 08:08.946
Look, I'm just...

08:08.947 --> 08:11.574
I do power systems.

08:11.575 --> 08:14.911
Okay? I'm an electrician, technically,

08:14.912 --> 08:17.288
look, but people,
organizations, individuals,

08:17.289 --> 08:19.999
they hire me to do... stuff.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.626
Illegal stuff.

08:21.627 --> 08:22.835
Look, they hit me up online,

08:22.836 --> 08:25.004
they wanted me to build
some power converter

08:25.005 --> 08:27.632
to leech off a larger network.

08:27.633 --> 08:29.759
Okay? I'd never seen anything like it.

08:29.760 --> 08:32.638
All right, I was halfway
through programming that...

08:34.515 --> 08:36.016
you showed up.

08:46.401 --> 08:47.903
Thanks for tellin' me all that, Ken.

08:50.280 --> 08:51.239
Way my life works,

08:51.240 --> 08:55.368
that's the most anybody's said to me
in over five years.

08:55.369 --> 08:57.913
It's mostly just screaming and begging.

09:00.040 --> 09:02.084
It's nice to listen to somebody else talk.

09:11.301 --> 09:13.511
Ain't nobody coming, chump.

09:17.808 --> 09:19.935
At least nobody
who ain't supposed to die.

09:23.730 --> 09:25.690
<i>You psychopath!</i>

09:25.691 --> 09:27.858
You total asshole.
I can't believe you did this to me!

09:27.859 --> 09:29.360
<i>I can't even believe
you did this to yourself!</i>

09:29.361 --> 09:34.448
Looks like our suspect's undergone
a profound change in attitude.

09:34.449 --> 09:35.741
"Gordon Rimmer."

09:35.742 --> 09:37.244
Interesting.

09:38.120 --> 09:39.161
And look at all this stuff.

09:39.162 --> 09:42.081
This guy really likes Lux DuJour.

09:42.082 --> 09:43.624
You ever listen to any of his music?

09:43.625 --> 09:46.043
- A bit loud for me.
- Where's the clicker?

09:46.044 --> 09:47.420
Look,

09:47.421 --> 09:48.713
Lux DuJour sucks,
and I'm getting out of here now.

09:48.714 --> 09:50.631
Can't open the garage door. Too loud.

09:50.632 --> 09:53.259
Besides, we have
to investigate the house.

09:53.260 --> 09:54.552
Wasn't there--

09:54.553 --> 09:57.513
Didn't Lux DuJour disappear?

09:57.514 --> 09:59.599
I vaguely recall it
being a big story at the time.

09:59.600 --> 10:01.309
Maybe he's in there!

10:01.310 --> 10:03.520
I am not investigating anything!

10:04.855 --> 10:06.690
Then how will you get
your lottery ticket?

10:11.069 --> 10:13.946
Are you insane?

10:13.947 --> 10:15.657
Shh.

11:38.782 --> 11:40.908
Would you let me finish?

11:40.909 --> 11:43.327
Go sit over there! God!

11:46.498 --> 11:47.916
Hello?

11:48.709 --> 11:50.042
<i>Hang on.</i>

11:50.043 --> 11:51.128
Hang on!

11:57.092 --> 11:58.593
<i>Well, we find them too.</i>

11:59.803 --> 12:03.097
It's the two guys from the hotel.
They're obviously in on it.

12:03.098 --> 12:06.016
<i>The giraffe and the gorilla.</i>

12:06.017 --> 12:07.477
<i>You'd be upset too
if a giraffe tried to kill you!</i>

12:13.817 --> 12:14.818
Get back!

12:20.198 --> 12:21.615
<i>She's right here with me now.</i>

12:21.616 --> 12:24.827
<i>Uh-huh. Yeah...</i>

12:24.828 --> 12:26.288
<i>Yeah. Well, where is he?</i>

12:27.873 --> 12:29.457
<i>What? I don't--</i>

12:29.458 --> 12:34.211
<i>I don't care where she is,
'cause that's not my problem.</i>

12:34.212 --> 12:35.796
<i>Okay? And then what about--</i>

12:35.797 --> 12:37.715
What about Red,
way out in the middle of nowhere?

12:37.716 --> 12:39.341
What about him?

12:39.342 --> 12:41.218
<i>There's probably one of them
still out there,</i>

12:41.219 --> 12:42.094
and if that's the case,

12:42.095 --> 12:43.888
then that's not good for any of us.

12:43.889 --> 12:45.681
Uh-huh. Yeah, well, no.

12:45.682 --> 12:49.059
And-- and we have to go
to the animal transfer unit.

12:49.060 --> 12:52.146
There was a goddamn shootout.
Bodies everywhere!

12:52.147 --> 12:55.399
<i>- We've got to clean it up!</i>
- Did he say "bodies"?

12:55.400 --> 12:57.151
<i>...Very simple thing.</i>

12:57.152 --> 12:58.986
<i>That should have
been very super easy...</i>

12:58.987 --> 13:00.613
This is really bad, Todd!

13:00.614 --> 13:02.323
I would never have done this alone!

13:02.324 --> 13:04.950
But you were right!
That's Lydia Spring!

13:04.951 --> 13:06.660
This is a huge breakthrough!

13:06.661 --> 13:08.204
But it's possible we're going to die.

13:08.205 --> 13:09.163
God, I am so sorry.

13:09.164 --> 13:12.792
Oh, damn, we're really
living on the edge here, man.

13:12.793 --> 13:14.210
I don't care that Rainey is dead!

13:14.211 --> 13:15.878
Rainey is not the Supreme Soul!

13:15.879 --> 13:18.215
I am the Supreme Soul!
I am running things!

13:19.132 --> 13:20.217
<i>Yes!</i>

13:23.470 --> 13:25.179
<i>...And I'll tell you another thing.</i>

13:25.180 --> 13:27.515
<i>Someone--
Someone is watching us.</i>

13:27.516 --> 13:29.892
<i>I can feel it.</i>

13:29.893 --> 13:31.185
Oh, yeah, we're going
to do something about it.

13:31.186 --> 13:32.937
We're going to take back control.

13:32.938 --> 13:34.688
We're going to take back control,

13:34.689 --> 13:36.315
and we are going
to purify the situation.

13:36.316 --> 13:37.441
He has a gun!

13:37.442 --> 13:38.568
What?

13:51.456 --> 13:54.291
She broke the nose.

13:54.292 --> 13:55.585
Yes. It is.

13:57.379 --> 13:59.588
Hello, friend.

13:59.589 --> 14:01.131
We are Ed, Zed, and Fred.

14:01.132 --> 14:03.133
These are not our real names.

14:03.134 --> 14:05.302
What a relief.
Those names are so stupid!

14:05.303 --> 14:07.012
This is one of our machines.

14:07.013 --> 14:08.722
It's a very good machine.

14:08.723 --> 14:11.308
Your dead friend over there
had a bone saw.

14:11.309 --> 14:13.519
He told me he was
going to cut my face off.

14:13.520 --> 14:16.146
Yes, Ned liked to do that.

14:16.147 --> 14:18.816
Some people
like to cut other people.

14:18.817 --> 14:21.735
Where is Lydia Spring?

14:21.736 --> 14:23.153
Why are you doing this to Patrick?

14:23.154 --> 14:26.824
We are not doing anything
to the man Patrick Spring.

14:26.825 --> 14:29.577
His energy...

14:29.578 --> 14:31.496
out into the universe.

14:32.873 --> 14:35.458
You... you killed him?

14:37.168 --> 14:38.586
He is dead.

14:38.587 --> 14:40.671
That is a fact, yes.

14:40.672 --> 14:44.550
<i>And you were the person
hired to protect him.</i>

14:44.551 --> 14:47.428
<i>Him being dead seems to me
an oversight on your part.</i>

14:47.429 --> 14:49.221
In fact, it's quite
the opposite condition

14:49.222 --> 14:51.057
of the one
you would like him to be in.

14:56.271 --> 14:57.771
Where is the kitten?

14:57.772 --> 15:02.443
How was Patrick Spring
in two places at once?

15:02.444 --> 15:04.320
Who killed this man?

15:04.321 --> 15:05.863
<i>She's not saying anything, Ed.</i>

15:05.864 --> 15:08.032
Okay... Zed,

15:08.033 --> 15:11.535
will you expose her to the light?

15:11.536 --> 15:13.914
Yeah. Okay, Ed.

15:20.462 --> 15:21.545
<i>Well, nothing left here.</i>

15:21.546 --> 15:25.466
Call the crime scene guys
to come and clean it up.

15:25.467 --> 15:29.136
Oh, and thank you for
covering for me the other day.

15:29.137 --> 15:30.054
Oh, it's no problem.

15:30.055 --> 15:31.805
I know you're going
through some stuff, so...

15:31.806 --> 15:34.433
I'm figuring it out.
Step by step.

15:34.434 --> 15:36.477
Divorce is hard,
Weedle, let me tell you.

15:36.478 --> 15:38.771
It's like becoming
a whole other person.

15:38.772 --> 15:39.855
Right.

15:39.856 --> 15:41.231
How's it going with Sammy?

15:41.232 --> 15:42.358
Oh...

15:42.359 --> 15:44.902
it's complicated.
It's very complicated.

15:44.903 --> 15:45.987
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

15:48.490 --> 15:49.699
Look who it is.

15:50.867 --> 15:53.160
Estevez and Zimmerfield.

15:53.161 --> 15:55.537
- Nathan. Agent Weedle.
- Hello.

15:55.538 --> 15:57.831
We were relieved
you were still in town,

15:57.832 --> 16:00.459
worried you'd skipped out
onto the next case.

16:00.460 --> 16:02.294
Well, the opiate ring
that Dorian Rothlighter was running

16:02.295 --> 16:04.171
still exists,
with or without him,

16:04.172 --> 16:05.839
so as long as your boy,
Todd Brotzman,

16:05.840 --> 16:08.550
remains a person of interest
in your case,

16:08.551 --> 16:11.595
I'd say he's a person
of interest in ours, right?

16:11.596 --> 16:13.138
How about the other guy?
What happened to him?

16:13.139 --> 16:16.475
The other guy?
Dirk Gently?

16:16.476 --> 16:18.687
Word came from on high
to let him go.

16:19.145 --> 16:21.230
- Active state interest.
- What, like, the CIA?

16:21.231 --> 16:23.023
- Something like that.
- Exactly like that.

16:23.024 --> 16:24.858
Wow. You guys really

16:24.859 --> 16:26.485
have your hands full
in Missing Persons.

16:26.486 --> 16:28.112
Maybe Major Crimes
should take a crack at it,

16:28.113 --> 16:31.281
give you two guys a break.

16:31.282 --> 16:34.076
We're here about the bodies.

16:34.077 --> 16:36.787
Bodies? What bodies?

16:36.788 --> 16:37.997
Men with tattoos,

16:37.998 --> 16:40.457
heavy tattoos all over.

16:40.458 --> 16:41.876
You didn't--

16:44.838 --> 16:46.839
You didn't transfer the bodies
from the Patrick Spring case?

16:46.840 --> 16:49.633
- No. What would we want with them?
- We do not want bodies.

16:49.634 --> 16:50.718
No, we don't.

16:50.719 --> 16:52.094
<i>So you're saying there was no transfer?</i>

16:52.095 --> 16:53.555
The FBI didn't...

16:57.434 --> 16:59.226
We gotta go.

16:59.227 --> 17:00.353
Bye.

17:01.646 --> 17:03.857
Idiots.

17:04.357 --> 17:05.357
Assholes.

17:05.358 --> 17:07.317
All that matters is the girl.

17:07.318 --> 17:09.236
Patrick Spring is dead,

17:09.237 --> 17:12.365
but we can still save Lydia, yeah?
That's our job.

17:16.536 --> 17:18.078
Hey, buddy!

17:18.079 --> 17:20.873
Think I figured out your problem.

17:25.795 --> 17:28.255
It's this carburetor.
I think I can fix it up,

17:28.256 --> 17:33.719
- but... it's gonna take a bit of time.
- Okay. Great, thank you.

17:33.720 --> 17:37.556
You don't think there's a chance
that you could, you know,

17:37.557 --> 17:41.477
call a cab for me
or something like that?

17:41.478 --> 17:43.437
We're lucky we met.

17:43.438 --> 17:46.356
<i>Look at this.
This road's empty.</i>

17:46.357 --> 17:50.027
- Plenty of people die out here.
- Hah! Right.

17:50.028 --> 17:53.363
No. You wouldn't. Or won't. Die.
Nobody's gonna die ever!

17:53.364 --> 17:56.366
Some people will die,
but that's just nature.

17:56.367 --> 17:57.743
It's all just nature.

17:57.744 --> 17:59.996
Isn't it great that we're
out here in nature together?

18:00.955 --> 18:03.083
Thank you. Thank you.

18:03.917 --> 18:04.917
You guys on drugs?

18:04.918 --> 18:06.668
No!

18:06.669 --> 18:08.587
A cab? Really?

18:08.588 --> 18:11.091
Why didn't you just ask him
to fly you in a private jet?

18:15.261 --> 18:19.556
- You want some raisins?
- No.

18:19.557 --> 18:21.141
Yes.

18:21.142 --> 18:23.228
I haven't eaten for over 24 hours.

18:29.109 --> 18:32.152
When I was a kid, I was part of a...

18:32.153 --> 18:34.822
I don't know what it was.

18:34.823 --> 18:36.448
A few others like me, though.

18:36.449 --> 18:39.076
Others like you?
Assassins?

18:39.077 --> 18:42.412
I dunno.
I never got to meet 'em.

18:42.413 --> 18:44.623
I heard about 'em, though.

18:44.624 --> 18:46.668
I think about them sometimes.

18:49.045 --> 18:52.214
Lot more people
talking to me back then.

18:52.215 --> 18:54.884
So... Who is Dirk Gently?

18:58.096 --> 19:00.013
He came to me in a dream I had.

19:00.014 --> 19:02.392
The world will take me
where I need to go.

19:04.435 --> 19:08.897
I'm like a leaf
in the stream of creation...

19:08.898 --> 19:11.733
until I find Dirk Gently,
whoever or whatever that is,

19:11.734 --> 19:12.986
and then I'm a piranha.

19:14.028 --> 19:15.488
In the stream of creation.

19:17.574 --> 19:19.324
Speaking of,
I should really kill this guy.

19:19.325 --> 19:21.201
No, no, no. Wait, wait--

19:21.202 --> 19:22.327
Wait. wait.

19:22.328 --> 19:24.621
- What?
- Sorry.

19:24.622 --> 19:26.123
We can't murder him.

19:26.124 --> 19:27.250
Why not?

19:28.251 --> 19:29.961
He's helping us!

19:33.923 --> 19:35.884
Okay. If you say so.

19:37.427 --> 19:39.553
There must be a way
to get Lydia out of here,

19:39.554 --> 19:40.470
and then we can--

19:40.471 --> 19:42.307
Will you shut up
for a minute, please?

19:53.818 --> 19:56.737
It's just you,
and you were already here.

19:56.738 --> 19:58.406
I don't know why
I was startled, actually.

20:07.707 --> 20:09.708
This is all my fault.
Look, I--

20:09.709 --> 20:11.293
I have to tell you, okay?

20:11.294 --> 20:12.753
I'm sorry
about what I did before.

20:12.754 --> 20:13.754
With the lottery ticket.

20:13.755 --> 20:15.923
I think it was, in sight of hind,

20:15.924 --> 20:17.300
fairly messed up.

20:22.430 --> 20:24.431
No. It's going to be
a beautiful thing, you'll see.

20:30.355 --> 20:31.647
Shh!

20:31.648 --> 20:32.940
<i>No, it's going to be beautiful.</i>

20:32.941 --> 20:34.900
All right? This is just a speed bump.

20:34.901 --> 20:36.652
<i>Oh, it's a big speed bump.
Yeah, thanks, Tips.</i>

20:36.653 --> 20:38.654
I know that,
but you know what else?

20:38.655 --> 20:40.197
Technically, we're winning!

20:40.198 --> 20:41.741
<i>Uh-huh!</i>

20:42.200 --> 20:45.244
Well, we kill them, of course.
It's what we do.

20:45.245 --> 20:48.873
<i>...Both, yes, both. Why one?
That doesn't make sense.</i>

20:56.047 --> 20:58.173
Shh!

21:02.553 --> 21:03.804
Go away!!

21:03.805 --> 21:05.348
<i>Rapunzel,
what the hell are you doing in there?</i>

21:08.142 --> 21:09.227
What the hell was that?

21:10.311 --> 21:12.438
You didn't silence your phone?

21:24.575 --> 21:26.994
- You!
- Me! It is.

21:26.995 --> 21:28.246
Wait, do I know you?

21:29.289 --> 21:30.290
Shit!

21:39.299 --> 21:40.757
Rapunzel, what the--

21:50.143 --> 21:52.311
<i>Hey, it's Todd.
Leave a message.</i>

21:52.312 --> 21:54.563
Hey, Todd, it's me.

21:54.564 --> 21:58.400
Um... I know
that this might sound crazy,

21:58.401 --> 22:01.778
but... your friend, or your boss,

22:01.779 --> 22:05.407
<i>or your acquaintance,
or the detective guy...</i>

22:05.408 --> 22:10.078
He didn't mention having any guys,
like, following you,

22:10.079 --> 22:12.956
or anything like that, did he?

22:12.957 --> 22:16.002
'Cause... uh, there's this, um...

22:18.338 --> 22:19.921
You know what, never mind.

22:38.358 --> 22:41.027
What? What?
What do you want?

23:40.211 --> 23:41.963
Okay...

23:45.550 --> 23:46.466
All right, Creepy,

23:46.467 --> 23:48.468
we want answers,
and we want them n--

23:48.469 --> 23:49.761
Yes? Can I help you?

23:49.762 --> 23:50.971
That's not him.

23:50.972 --> 23:51.805
Where's the other guy?

23:51.806 --> 23:52.806
"Other guy"?

23:52.807 --> 23:55.308
The other guy! The other guy!
Where's the other guy?

23:55.309 --> 23:58.186
I'm sorry.
I'm the only coroner on duty today.

23:58.187 --> 24:00.230
<i>What department
did you say you were from?</i>

24:00.231 --> 24:01.773
Missing Persons.
We had an appointment this morning.

24:01.774 --> 24:02.732
- This morning?
- Yeah.

24:02.733 --> 24:04.652
- What time?
- 9:00 a.m.

24:05.570 --> 24:07.404
- He wasn't here yet.
- That's what he's about to say.

24:07.405 --> 24:08.865
I wasn't here yet.

24:10.158 --> 24:11.909
Someone is screwing with us.

24:13.369 --> 24:15.871
Dirk Gently.
Todd Brotzman.

24:15.872 --> 24:17.330
Smoke and mirrors, man.

24:17.331 --> 24:19.374
I mean...

24:19.375 --> 24:21.586
something's for real actually goin' down.

24:25.715 --> 24:27.175
We are on our way now.

24:28.342 --> 24:32.345
<i>So when the cops said
"anything suspicious..."</i>

24:32.346 --> 24:33.723
Right.

24:36.058 --> 24:37.017
Now, we follow up on this,

24:37.018 --> 24:39.478
that doesn't make us
their bitch, right?

24:39.479 --> 24:40.979
I don't think so.

24:40.980 --> 24:42.439
'Cause that...

24:42.440 --> 24:44.066
that seems suspicious.

24:45.776 --> 24:46.943
We could just call them.

24:46.944 --> 24:47.987
And say what?

24:50.865 --> 24:54.326
- Yeah, we're not their bitch.
- Right?

24:54.327 --> 24:55.703
Let's roll.

25:16.265 --> 25:17.307
Got the dog.

25:17.308 --> 25:19.059
What? Why?

25:19.060 --> 25:20.602
The dog is important.

25:20.603 --> 25:22.979
Lots of animals in this case, it seems.

25:22.980 --> 25:25.106
The dog, the shark, the kitten--

25:25.107 --> 25:26.149
What-- What kitten?

25:26.150 --> 25:28.235
Wait, no. Screw that. Never mind.

25:28.236 --> 25:30.362
How did you even
hear about the shark?

25:30.363 --> 25:31.404
Mm? What are you talking about?

25:31.405 --> 25:32.864
Hours ago, in the bushes,

25:32.865 --> 25:34.491
before we were trapped
in that guy's house,

25:34.492 --> 25:35.951
you said Patrick Spring
was killed by a shark.

25:35.952 --> 25:37.577
You've got a great memory.

25:37.578 --> 25:39.120
How do you even know
about the shark?

25:39.121 --> 25:41.248
- The hotel room?
- I didn't know about that.

25:41.249 --> 25:43.333
No, never mind. Never mind.

25:43.334 --> 25:44.584
I-I-I did my duty.

25:44.585 --> 25:47.295
- I helped you steal a dog?
- Ish.

25:47.296 --> 25:48.797
You did your duty-ish!

25:48.798 --> 25:51.466
You didn't even do a full
half of a duty, you lazy man, Todd!

25:51.467 --> 25:53.635
You tricked me into
breaking into a house with you.

25:53.636 --> 25:56.137
- You could've waited outside.
- Someone shot at us!

25:56.138 --> 25:57.347
Hey, he only shot at me.

25:57.348 --> 25:59.474
And the house
was even more mysterious,

25:59.475 --> 26:01.726
and we learned about
that rock star, Lux DuJour.

26:01.727 --> 26:02.727
When did we learn about that?

26:02.728 --> 26:05.605
And this man, Gordon Rimmer,
it's all very suspicious.

26:07.858 --> 26:11.111
He called the human Lydia "Rapunzel,"

26:11.112 --> 26:14.198
ergo, vis a vis, I forward a theory!

26:16.117 --> 26:17.909
Are you Lydia Spring?

26:21.205 --> 26:22.247
You are?

26:22.248 --> 26:23.582
I want to go home,

26:23.583 --> 26:25.750
but I know you'll just be there now,
so it's like--

26:25.751 --> 26:28.253
What we're dealing with here
appears to be a criminal,

26:28.254 --> 26:29.838
or perhaps a group,

26:29.839 --> 26:33.258
that specializes in hypnotizing humans
into believing they're specific dogs,

26:33.259 --> 26:35.969
and hypnotizing dogs
into believing they're specific humans.

26:35.970 --> 26:37.721
I just want to go
cash in my lottery ticket,

26:37.722 --> 26:39.973
- call my sister back, and--
- Todd, focus.

26:39.974 --> 26:42.434
What could Patrick Spring have done
to anger an evil enclave

26:42.435 --> 26:44.144
of uncommonly specific dog hypnotists?

26:44.145 --> 26:46.938
They're not dog hypnotists!

26:46.939 --> 26:50.817
Ah! You're about to forward a theory!
Excellent! I'm listening!

26:50.818 --> 26:52.819
She clearly wanted to be there.

26:52.820 --> 26:54.988
She wasn't hypnotized,
she wasn't tied up,

26:54.989 --> 26:56.406
there weren't bars on the windows,

26:56.407 --> 27:00.702
- and she seemed happy--
- Yes, like a happy dog.

27:00.703 --> 27:02.495
Just call the police.

27:02.496 --> 27:04.706
At this point,
I can't explain why I was there,

27:04.707 --> 27:06.583
and I'm already
in deep crap with them,

27:06.584 --> 27:08.627
so just-- just call them.
Do it. Okay?

27:08.628 --> 27:12.088
I'm done, so you handle it now.

27:12.089 --> 27:13.716
You're still wearing the shower curtain!

27:19.639 --> 27:21.390
Hey, you think I like this?

27:26.312 --> 27:27.312
Isn't this your job?

27:27.313 --> 27:28.563
You're a detective. Don't you--

27:28.564 --> 27:29.981
Because I'm trying
to do the right thing,

27:29.982 --> 27:32.108
don't you understand?

27:32.109 --> 27:33.985
It's always...

27:33.986 --> 27:36.946
all these horrible things,

27:36.947 --> 27:39.240
and I get dragged
right up next to them.

27:39.241 --> 27:40.450
Couldn't you just--

27:40.451 --> 27:41.576
I mean, you could just walk away,

27:41.577 --> 27:44.871
- take whatever Spring paid you and--
- No. It's...

27:44.872 --> 27:47.791
The world will lead me
where I need to go.

27:47.792 --> 27:52.420
I'm a... a leaf in the stream of creation,

27:52.421 --> 27:53.672
right up until I find

27:53.673 --> 27:56.801
whoever or whatever
killed Patrick Spring.

27:58.135 --> 27:59.470
And then it will just...

28:00.096 --> 28:02.639
take me somewhere new.

28:02.640 --> 28:05.475
What's with all your crap about
taking control of your life?

28:05.476 --> 28:06.768
Just because you know
you're playing a game

28:06.769 --> 28:08.437
doesn't mean
you don't choose your moves.

28:09.897 --> 28:12.649
The cases I end up on--

28:12.650 --> 28:14.651
if I don't solve them,

28:14.652 --> 28:16.237
<i>no one does.</i>

28:23.494 --> 28:25.328
Oh dear.

28:25.329 --> 28:29.499
"We have your friend,"
and then a picture of a woman.

28:29.500 --> 28:30.458
Who's it from?

28:30.459 --> 28:32.585
The man, I assume, the bad man.

28:32.586 --> 28:34.003
How did he get your number?

28:34.004 --> 28:35.839
- I gave him my cards.
- You gave him your card?

28:35.840 --> 28:38.633
No, my cards, all of them.
Self-defense.

28:38.634 --> 28:40.219
I do a lot of things,
and then later I'm like--

28:43.264 --> 28:46.600
You don't happen
to know this woman, do you?

28:48.352 --> 28:49.729
Open this door.

28:53.399 --> 28:57.152
"Give us the dog or we will kill her.
Eastgate Bridge. Midnight."

28:57.153 --> 29:00.948
Ha! See?
I told you the dog was important!

29:15.963 --> 29:17.464
This is bad.

29:17.465 --> 29:19.758
This isn't going to work.
This is a bad idea.

29:19.759 --> 29:21.509
Nonsense.
This is the perfect opportunity

29:21.510 --> 29:23.678
- to get some answers.
- The man shot at us.

29:23.679 --> 29:25.388
<i>What if he just pulls a gun?</i>

29:25.389 --> 29:29.018
Aha, that's why I brought... this.

29:30.436 --> 29:32.437
What's that supposed to do?

29:32.438 --> 29:35.523
Well, you know what they say
about bringing a knife to a gun fight...

29:35.524 --> 29:37.442
That it's...bad?

29:37.443 --> 29:39.235
Oh, bloody hell,
is that what that means?

29:41.822 --> 29:43.616
That's him. The man.

29:50.581 --> 29:51.998
What do we do?

29:51.999 --> 29:54.210
Well, I think...

29:54.668 --> 29:56.295
Aw...

30:06.305 --> 30:08.973
- Check this out.
- All right.

30:08.974 --> 30:10.476
What have we got?

30:11.143 --> 30:14.646
Holy shit. That's the guy.
That's... that's Todd Brotzman.

30:14.647 --> 30:16.856
And Dirk Gently. Full house.

30:16.857 --> 30:18.566
Missing Persons
was actually onto something.

30:18.567 --> 30:21.027
We bring them in as soon
as whatever this is is done.

30:21.028 --> 30:22.154
Got it.

30:28.244 --> 30:29.994
Is that the woman?

30:29.995 --> 30:31.329
I don't know her.

30:31.330 --> 30:33.998
Right, but that is a woman.

30:33.999 --> 30:36.543
What are you even talking about?

30:36.544 --> 30:38.003
Get on your knees.

30:41.131 --> 30:43.341
Give me the dog,

30:43.342 --> 30:44.175
or I'll kill her!

30:44.176 --> 30:45.468
Give us the her

30:45.469 --> 30:47.345
or we'll throw the dog off the bridge!

30:47.346 --> 30:48.346
- What?
- I'm bluffing,

30:48.347 --> 30:50.515
but if he shoots her,
throw the dog off the bridge.

30:50.516 --> 30:53.017
- Why did you attack us?
- We didn't!

30:53.018 --> 30:55.854
- How do you know who we are?
- We don't.

30:55.855 --> 30:57.272
- Where is the kitten?
- What kitten?

30:57.273 --> 30:58.231
Who's that woman?

30:58.232 --> 31:00.275
- You don't know her?
- Do you?

31:00.276 --> 31:04.070
- Why did you burn my house down?
- I burnt your house down?

31:04.071 --> 31:06.364
- Where's Lydia?
- She's not here.

31:06.365 --> 31:08.199
Bring me the dog.

31:08.200 --> 31:10.201
- Why do you want it?
- Why did you take it?

31:10.202 --> 31:12.453
- We don't know!
- Why did you kill Patrick Spring?

31:12.454 --> 31:14.081
- We didn't.
- Did you?

31:14.790 --> 31:16.499
Just...just bring me the dog!

31:16.500 --> 31:17.917
What the hell are they talking about?

31:17.918 --> 31:20.086
Dogs? Cats? I don't know.

31:20.087 --> 31:22.463
These are the stupidest
goddamn people alive.

31:22.464 --> 31:23.673
What do we do?

31:23.674 --> 31:25.758
I... I don't know.

31:25.759 --> 31:28.220
I'll kill her! I swear!

31:31.974 --> 31:34.101
Todd... Todd, wait! Maybe...

31:40.816 --> 31:42.233
Let the woman go.

31:42.234 --> 31:44.777
No, no, no, no, no.
She stays with us.

31:44.778 --> 31:46.863
- That wasn't the deal.
- There's no deal.

31:46.864 --> 31:48.198
Shit! He's right!

31:49.116 --> 31:50.618
Bring me the dog!

31:56.415 --> 31:57.707
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

31:57.708 --> 32:00.043
- No!
- Let the woman go or I drop it.

32:00.044 --> 32:02.754
<i>Just let her go now!</i>

32:02.755 --> 32:04.589
You are poking a bear, my friend!

32:04.590 --> 32:07.550
We will burn the soul out of your body
for what you've done to us.

32:07.551 --> 32:10.094
What are you talking about?
What did we do to you?

32:10.095 --> 32:13.806
- Don't drop my dog!
- Let her go now or I drop it, I swear to God--

32:13.807 --> 32:15.600
- Let her go!
- No, no, no, no, no.

32:15.601 --> 32:16.810
No!

32:18.145 --> 32:19.020
Help me!

32:20.105 --> 32:21.481
No!

32:21.482 --> 32:23.483
Holy shit! It's going down.

32:24.610 --> 32:26.487
I'm coming!

32:29.448 --> 32:30.823
Todd! Men!

32:37.206 --> 32:38.415
No!

32:40.084 --> 32:41.335
<i>Nathan!</i>

32:42.461 --> 32:44.254
Put that down--

32:47.800 --> 32:49.175
Todd, what happened?

32:49.176 --> 32:50.843
I saw a human face on the dog!

32:52.388 --> 32:53.973
Rapunzel!

33:08.445 --> 33:11.447
- Did you find the dog?
- No.

33:11.448 --> 33:13.074
And what the hell happened?
Who shot Fred?

33:13.075 --> 33:15.159
There were two men
hiding under the bridge.

33:15.160 --> 33:17.579
One we released from his body,
the other still lives.

33:19.415 --> 33:22.543
They threw the goddamn dog
off the bridge.

33:23.794 --> 33:26.170
Did you see it come out of the water?

33:26.171 --> 33:27.630
No. Very busy.

33:27.631 --> 33:29.716
It's in control.
Everything's gonna be fine.

33:29.717 --> 33:31.343
It's gonna be fine.
It's gonna be fine.

33:33.512 --> 33:36.723
Wait a second, there's two guys.
You said you got two guys.

33:36.724 --> 33:37.640
Who were those two guys?

33:37.641 --> 33:40.102
I don't know.
They had these.

33:42.271 --> 33:43.814
What the hell is this?
What the...

33:45.149 --> 33:46.899
FBI?

33:46.900 --> 33:50.028
You gotta be
goddamn kidding me.

33:50.029 --> 33:51.572
<i>And this one's still alive?</i>

33:53.449 --> 33:54.533
He is.

33:59.580 --> 34:02.665
How would you like
to be a secret agent?

34:06.003 --> 34:08.630
All right. All right.
All right. Let's go.

34:13.761 --> 34:16.220
That'll do it.

34:16.221 --> 34:18.848
Sorry it took longer than I thought.

34:18.849 --> 34:20.516
You should go.

34:20.517 --> 34:21.392
What?

34:21.393 --> 34:22.770
Run!

34:26.648 --> 34:28.859
You realize I'm gonna take the car.

34:30.486 --> 34:32.236
Take the car?
What? What? Why?

34:32.237 --> 34:33.571
You must be--

34:33.572 --> 34:37.492
hell, you must be the tenth couple
we've found out here.

34:37.493 --> 34:39.368
We shoot you in the head,

34:39.369 --> 34:41.287
cut you up,

34:41.288 --> 34:43.082
sell the car for pieces...

34:44.374 --> 34:45.708
cut that up too.

34:45.709 --> 34:48.711
What? Wait, wait, wait.
Listen, listen, listen.

34:48.712 --> 34:49.838
I'm listening.

34:52.424 --> 34:56.887
Look, man, you're the one
that's in danger, okay?

35:00.057 --> 35:01.683
Can I kill him now?

35:03.268 --> 35:04.852
You're embarrassing yourself.

35:04.853 --> 35:07.313
Yes?

35:20.369 --> 35:21.703
Okay?

35:35.801 --> 35:37.344
There goes that.

35:40.889 --> 35:43.599
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Jesus Christ!

35:43.600 --> 35:45.309
Did you just dodge a bullet?

35:45.310 --> 35:47.854
No.
Bullet dodged me.

35:47.855 --> 35:50.565
I can't be hurt,
universe won't allow it.

35:50.566 --> 35:52.733
Only constants are me and gravity.

35:52.734 --> 35:54.944
I'm special that way.

35:54.945 --> 35:56.530
You're insane.

36:04.204 --> 36:05.581
See?

36:21.096 --> 36:22.638
Ho...ly...

36:22.639 --> 36:23.849
Whaddya know?

36:31.064 --> 36:32.815
You said you kill whoever you meet.

36:32.816 --> 36:34.026
That's right.

36:35.777 --> 36:38.863
I'm still here.

36:38.864 --> 36:40.532
You haven't killed me yet.

36:43.160 --> 36:44.785
That's true.

36:44.786 --> 36:46.914
I guess that must mean
you're special too.

37:01.511 --> 37:03.222
Would you get in the car?

37:15.609 --> 37:17.069
They'll see you now, sir.

37:24.868 --> 37:26.369
Thank you for coming, Colonel.

37:26.370 --> 37:28.204
Where's General Kinsey?

37:28.205 --> 37:30.499
You don't report to him anymore.
You report to me.

37:31.667 --> 37:32.875
I'm Wilson.

37:32.876 --> 37:34.543
This oversight committee
has been reviewing

37:34.544 --> 37:35.753
Project "Black Wing."

37:35.754 --> 37:37.755
Then you know
that I've been operating

37:37.756 --> 37:39.924
under an extremely limited budget.

37:39.925 --> 37:43.386
- Given Black Wing's significance...
- Significance?

37:43.387 --> 37:46.055
While you did discover
some interesting phenomena,

37:46.056 --> 37:50.393
your research was inconclusive
and without definable results.

37:50.394 --> 37:51.936
<i>Mistakes were made.</i>

37:51.937 --> 37:54.730
And worse is that you failed
to keep the subjects contained

37:54.731 --> 37:56.399
and recover them
from the initial breach.

37:56.400 --> 38:00.194
Now we have potentially
dangerous individuals at large--

38:00.195 --> 38:01.070
over 30 of them.

38:01.071 --> 38:03.948
And currently, we only
have budget to surveil one...

38:03.949 --> 38:05.158
"Icarus."

38:07.828 --> 38:09.829
The one currently
going by the name "Dirk Gently."

38:09.830 --> 38:11.664
The fact is, Ma'am, there's a reason

38:11.665 --> 38:14.083
that we haven't tried
to bring in suspects after 15 years.

38:14.084 --> 38:15.835
They cannot be contained.

38:15.836 --> 38:19.088
I believe that we have
an undetermined threat out there,

38:19.089 --> 38:20.382
and I don't like it.

38:21.174 --> 38:22.301
<i>Not one bit.</i>

38:23.593 --> 38:30.308
You claim that you have
unique insight into these subjects?

38:30.309 --> 38:33.185
Well, I am giving you
one last chance, Colonel.

38:33.186 --> 38:36.605
Bring them back in yourself,
because right now,

38:36.606 --> 38:39.734
they are merely another loose end
that needs to be snipped.

38:39.735 --> 38:43.029
We have many threats to deal with.

38:43.030 --> 38:44.322
Too many.
Do you understand?

38:44.323 --> 38:46.532
- Surely you're not proposing--
- And if you fail again,

38:46.533 --> 38:48.743
the former Black Wing subjects
will be eliminated,

38:48.744 --> 38:50.328
starting with Dirk Gently.

38:50.329 --> 38:52.330
I think you're
overestimating your ability to--

38:52.331 --> 38:54.165
<i>All of them.</i>

38:54.166 --> 38:55.334
Eliminated.

39:26.365 --> 39:28.240
God, how is your place
so much nicer than mine?

39:28.241 --> 39:31.036
Pounds to the dollar, I think.
Exchange rate. Maths.

39:34.414 --> 39:36.374
Hey, hi.

39:36.375 --> 39:38.084
What... what happened?

39:38.085 --> 39:40.711
We got you away from those--

39:40.712 --> 39:42.046
the other guys,

39:42.047 --> 39:43.881
<i>so just...</i>

39:43.882 --> 39:44.715
lay here,

39:44.716 --> 39:47.052
and I'll get you a glass of water?

39:51.598 --> 39:53.057
Thank you for
helping me through that.

39:53.058 --> 39:54.975
I don't know what I would've done
if you hadn't been there.

39:54.976 --> 39:57.561
Yeah, well, I was there.

39:57.562 --> 39:59.188
You're really brave, sort of.

39:59.189 --> 40:03.109
Like crazy brave.
Or maybe just stupid, but wow.

40:03.110 --> 40:05.069
And also surprisingly incapable.

40:05.070 --> 40:06.445
How've you survived this long?

40:06.446 --> 40:08.114
Well, that's why I needed you.

40:08.115 --> 40:10.825
Ha! God, how crazy was that?

40:10.826 --> 40:13.202
<i>Those guys are total nutjobs.</i>

40:13.203 --> 40:14.912
You think they're the ones
who killed Patrick Spring?

40:14.913 --> 40:15.746
I'm not sure yet.

40:15.747 --> 40:17.081
Well, it's got to be connected, right?

40:17.082 --> 40:19.458
I mean, maybe they're
part of the same group.

40:19.459 --> 40:21.252
The guys at the hotel,

40:21.253 --> 40:23.254
<i>the corpses--
the ones who weren't Spring--</i>

40:23.255 --> 40:25.506
they had the same tattoos
we saw tonight.

40:25.507 --> 40:26.758
It is connected.

40:27.884 --> 40:29.343
Dirk...

40:29.344 --> 40:31.470
I saw something...

40:31.471 --> 40:34.557
Crazier than the dog, something else.
I don't know how to describe it, but--

40:36.726 --> 40:37.810
<i>Whose cat is that?</i>

40:37.811 --> 40:40.688
Oh, it's the one from the crime scene.
The one everyone's been looking for.

40:41.898 --> 40:43.774
What? Um, hold on--

40:43.775 --> 40:44.692
Dirk?

40:44.693 --> 40:46.111
Hi, Farah.

40:48.196 --> 40:49.780
- You know her?
- Well, I--

40:49.781 --> 40:51.532
So when they said
that they have your friend,

40:51.533 --> 40:52.783
they meant your friend?

40:52.784 --> 40:53.909
More of an acquaintance, really.

40:53.910 --> 40:54.995
Mother...
