04:46.754 --> 04:48.453

of fatherhood

could affect a kid.

05:22.990 --> 05:24.990
Son, I won't strangle
you anymore,

you that minibike.

Bart's mad because he wanted
me to buy him something,

the right thing to do--

books for years.

By not telling the teacher
that Jimmy cheated

06:54.481 --> 06:56.848
on the French test,
it's like I cheated.

would that be
worth some money?

07:13.066 --> 07:16.101
Well, in season two,
when Sam got good grades,

07:16.103 --> 07:18.804

07:18.806 --> 07:21.907
And if you do it, son,
you'll get the same.

07:21.909 --> 07:23.642
There's no way
that means anything

07:23.644 --> 07:26.311

get a minibike.

11:35.195 --> 11:37.696
Hey, they're
your gutters, too.

11:37.698 --> 11:39.197
Oh!

11:39.433 --> 11:42.300
(grunting with effort)

11:42.302 --> 11:43.868
Huh?

11:49.810 --> 11:52.043
You must've found out
about my letters.

11:52.045 --> 11:53.211
(chuckles nervously)

11:53.213 --> 11:54.713
They were just a joke.

11:54.715 --> 11:55.947
Really?
That's too bad.

11:55.949 --> 11:59.150
Because we are very
interested in your offer.

12:01.321 --> 12:03.354
Uh, you're just lucky
we picked you up

12:03.356 --> 12:05.423
before the FBI got to you.

12:07.861 --> 12:12.764
Another disgrace for the
French Bureau of Investigation.

12:13.333 --> 12:16.067
Don't forget us,
the A-Team of Finland.

12:16.069 --> 12:19.838
I pity the fool who messes
with B.A. Backstrum.

12:19.840 --> 12:23.575
("A-Team"-like theme plays out)

12:29.449 --> 12:30.482
We accept your offer.

12:30.484 --> 12:32.550
The secrets from
your father's nuclear plant

12:32.552 --> 12:35.720
for one
Street Assassin minibike.

12:36.256 --> 12:37.255
Just transfer everything

12:37.257 --> 12:39.190
to this flash drive.

12:41.094 --> 12:41.893
I don't know.

12:41.895 --> 12:43.361
Can I really betray my country?

12:43.363 --> 12:46.231
I say the
Pledge of Allegiance every day.

12:46.233 --> 12:48.566
You pledge allegiance
to the flag.

12:48.568 --> 12:50.935
And the flag is
made in China.

12:50.937 --> 12:51.870
Hmph.

12:51.872 --> 12:54.305
ANNOUNCER: We return
to "Thicker Than Waters,"

12:54.307 --> 12:56.207

NARRATOR: Digby Sheridan,
who played Patrick,

12:58.678 --> 13:01.312
had enormous problems
with the show.

13:01.314 --> 13:03.281
(British accent):
Crap, total crap.

13:03.283 --> 13:05.517
You, writer,
what's your name?

13:05.519 --> 13:06.985
Um, David Mamet.

13:06.987 --> 13:09.854
Well, Mr. Mamet,
why don't you (bleep) learn

13:09.856 --> 13:12.824
how to (bleep)
write a (bleep) script!

13:14.294 --> 13:16.194
Hmm... (bleep).

13:16.196 --> 13:17.962
I could use that.

13:23.236 --> 13:27.939
Dad, I was thinking
about it, and you're right.

13:27.941 --> 13:30.041
You shouldn't buy me
something I didn't earn.

13:30.043 --> 13:31.476
And because you gave me
the tough love

13:31.478 --> 13:34.012
I didn't know I needed,
I'm gonna be spending

13:34.014 --> 13:36.281
lots and lots
more time with you.

13:36.283 --> 13:37.649
Aw.

13:37.651 --> 13:40.618
(sneaky chuckle)
He's buying it.

13:40.620 --> 13:42.320
I'm buying it!

One of those retinal

Want me to take it
up to your bed

15:49.316 --> 15:50.648
so you can snuggle with it?

15:50.650 --> 15:51.382
No!

15:51.384 --> 15:53.217
Why in the world
would you get me this?

15:53.219 --> 15:55.586
Because you've been
such a great kid lately,

15:55.588 --> 15:59.123
and I wanted to show you
I appreciated it.

15:59.125 --> 16:00.024
Oh.

16:00.026 --> 16:02.060
That's great.
(chuckles)

16:02.062 --> 16:06.397
I wouldn't trade it for
all the tea in... China...

16:06.399 --> 16:08.099
(suspiciously):
Something wrong, Bart?

16:08.101 --> 16:11.202
You betrayed your
country for no reason.

16:11.204 --> 16:15.039

16:34.294 --> 16:37.195
Mm, the boy's
acting really weird.

16:37.197 --> 16:39.897
I did everything
that TV show told me to,

16:39.899 --> 16:40.565
and he's still not happy.

16:40.567 --> 16:45.370
Well, maybe you shouldn't listen
to a 30-year-old TV show

16:45.372 --> 16:46.170
that only got on the air

16:46.172 --> 16:47.505
'cause the creator
had evidence

16:47.507 --> 16:51.009
the network president
ran over a guy.

16:51.011 --> 16:53.211
Where's he going?

16:58.618 --> 17:03.554
Why on earth would a child
go to the zoo?

It's still here. Yes!

17:14.801 --> 17:19.003
I get the flash drive back
and the manila envelope!

17:20.173 --> 17:22.473
Aha! Typical
American treachery!

17:22.475 --> 17:26.077
I can't believe a boy
who would betray his country

17:26.079 --> 17:27.378
would betray
a different country.

17:27.380 --> 17:28.479
Unbelievable!

17:28.481 --> 17:29.147
Terrible!

17:29.149 --> 17:30.748
Masters, I can explain.

17:30.750 --> 17:31.616
Explain nothing!

17:31.618 --> 17:33.618

17:35.355 --> 17:36.054

17:36.056 --> 17:38.556
Then you leave
us no choice.

17:38.558 --> 17:39.357
A teddy bear?!

17:39.359 --> 17:43.227
A teddy bear
made in China.

17:45.465 --> 17:47.465
(electricity crackles)

17:52.205 --> 17:54.472
Step away from the traitor!

17:54.474 --> 17:54.939
Dad!

17:54.941 --> 17:56.507
The boy's flash drive
may be in there,

17:56.509 --> 18:01.512
but I've got a lifetime
of nuclear secrets up here.

18:02.148 --> 18:04.649
Okay, but don't
read our subtitles.

18:21.668 --> 18:22.867
I know what
you're saying.

18:22.869 --> 18:26.304
I understand food talk
in every language!

18:27.674 --> 18:31.275
American fatso, your knowledge
helped us build this plant.

18:31.277 --> 18:33.177
We would like you
to have the honor

18:33.179 --> 18:36.347
of cutting
the ceremonial ribbon.

18:39.252 --> 18:43.588
Um, I'll see myself out.

18:44.657 --> 18:49.327
Okay, who can take me to
the airport for less than $20?

18:52.699 --> 18:55.299
I can stand here all day.

18:55.301 --> 18:58.469
Oh, my feet hurt.

18:59.639 --> 19:01.272
You know, Dad,
I really did have

19:01.274 --> 19:02.640
a good time
hanging out with you.

19:02.642 --> 19:06.644
Well, now it's time for
the best kind of bonding--

19:06.646 --> 19:09.347
sitting next to each
other in silence,

19:09.349 --> 19:12.150
staring blankly
at the TV.

19:59.399 --> 20:01.332
Rebecca,
you briefly inspired

20:01.334 --> 20:03.401
the hairstyle called
"The Lizzie."

20:03.403 --> 20:05.803
Is "The Lizzie"
with us here tonight?

20:05.805 --> 20:07.605
I was clear with your people

20:07.607 --> 20:10.374
that I would not recreate
"The Lizzie."

20:10.376 --> 20:12.810
Oh, but "The Lizzie"
is here.

20:12.812 --> 20:15.246

"I shouldn't judge my prom date

20:15.248 --> 20:17.315
"just because
he's in a wheelchair.

20:17.317 --> 20:21.419
I should judge him
