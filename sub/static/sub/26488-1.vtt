WEBVTT

00:05.614 --> 00:09.009
June. June, uh,
my mom just called.

00:09.052 --> 00:10.314
I mean, Secretary McCord.

00:10.358 --> 00:11.750
I know who your mother is.

00:11.794 --> 00:12.925
Of course.
Uh, she's running late.

00:12.969 --> 00:14.275
SecState's
a few minutes late.

00:14.318 --> 00:15.754
Copy.

00:15.798 --> 00:17.104
Sorry.

00:17.147 --> 00:18.844
I think the president's
enjoying entertaining

00:18.888 --> 00:21.847
the Indian and Pakistani
prime ministers.

00:21.891 --> 00:24.024
DALTON:
So I'm at this

00:24.067 --> 00:27.549
donor dinner at a gator
farm in Tallahassee

00:27.592 --> 00:30.987
and I drop my phone in
the bushes. Reach down.

00:31.031 --> 00:32.858
Find myself face-to-face
with a 15-footer

00:32.902 --> 00:34.947
that had gotten loose.[chuckles]

00:34.991 --> 00:37.298
I thought American alligators
were supposed to be aggressive.

00:37.341 --> 00:39.082
They are.

00:39.126 --> 00:41.215
Unless you rub their bellies.

00:41.258 --> 00:42.868
Puts them to sleep.

00:42.912 --> 00:44.261
[all chuckle]

00:44.305 --> 00:46.655
He writes me now.[laughs]

00:46.698 --> 00:49.397
The president tried the
same trick with the speaker.

00:49.440 --> 00:52.008
Didn't work as well.The secretary's running late,
Mr. President.

00:52.052 --> 00:53.488
Thank you.

00:53.531 --> 00:57.013
Uh, apparently, Elizabeth
is running a little late.

00:57.057 --> 00:59.929
Ah, she has something more
important than making history?

00:59.972 --> 01:02.105
D.C. traffic.Ah.

01:02.149 --> 01:03.541
Good morning,
Minister Samant.

01:03.585 --> 01:04.847
Good morning, June.

01:04.890 --> 01:06.327
Just a few minutes behind.

01:06.370 --> 01:08.024
Can you believe how quickly
all this came together?

01:08.068 --> 01:09.547
In a word, hell no.

01:09.591 --> 01:11.245
CHONDITA: And your husband...DALTON: Welcome, Chondita.

01:11.288 --> 01:13.029
President Dalton.
Please.

01:13.073 --> 01:14.857
LUCY:
Pens...

01:14.900 --> 01:17.729
Kind of important for a signing
ceremony, don't you think?I, uh...

01:21.298 --> 01:24.084
[sighs] Crap.

01:24.127 --> 01:26.303
Ah.[phone rings]

01:28.349 --> 01:30.307
[screams]

01:41.013 --> 01:43.059
[high-pitched ringing]

01:45.148 --> 01:47.019
[distorted]:
We need a medic.

01:47.063 --> 01:50.719
[indistinct, distorted shouting]

01:56.203 --> 01:57.943
WOMAN:
Help her up!

01:57.987 --> 02:00.555
[coughing]

02:00.598 --> 02:02.209
Where is he?
Where is...?

02:02.252 --> 02:04.124
ALISON: All right!STEVIE: I got it! I got it!

02:04.167 --> 02:05.603
JASON:
That was probably too far over.

02:05.647 --> 02:07.692
Okay, coming for you. Ooh!Ready?

02:07.736 --> 02:08.954
[laughs]
Yep.

02:08.998 --> 02:10.956
That was her point.Over the net. I can't...

02:11.000 --> 02:14.177
Come on. It's
your serve, Jason.

02:14.221 --> 02:16.701
JASON: I'm a pro.Hey, you two.

02:16.745 --> 02:17.876
ELIZABETH: Don't say
that. You're not...

02:17.920 --> 02:18.921
HENRY: Hey.ELIZABETH: Hi.

02:18.964 --> 02:21.576
My Grandma Hattie's
famous gimlets.

02:21.619 --> 02:25.319
Oh, well, far be it from us
to let down Grandma Hattie.Wow.

02:25.362 --> 02:27.277
Oh, Lydia, thank
you so much...Thank you.

02:27.321 --> 02:29.061
...for everything,
all of it.

02:29.105 --> 02:30.585
Oh, please. I mean,

02:30.628 --> 02:31.934
what good is this
old money pit

02:31.977 --> 02:33.109
if you can't share it
with friends.

02:33.153 --> 02:34.110
Whoa.
[exhales]

02:34.154 --> 02:35.851
Grandma Hattie...Gosh.

02:35.894 --> 02:37.200
[laughs]
It's got a bite.

02:37.244 --> 02:38.419
Bottoms up.

02:38.462 --> 02:40.682
[both laugh]Oh, my gosh.

02:40.725 --> 02:42.727
[indistinct chatter nearby]

02:45.252 --> 02:48.037
If I have one of those, do you
promise not to tell Carol?

02:48.080 --> 02:49.343
I'll tell her.

02:49.386 --> 02:51.127
I don't know why you wives
are all so interested

02:51.171 --> 02:52.694
in keeping us around.

02:52.737 --> 02:54.217
Time for the
Daily Brief.

02:54.261 --> 02:55.392
Already?

02:55.436 --> 02:58.134
Might want to
lose the apron.

02:58.178 --> 03:00.615
Yeah. Although, I can't imagine
why they wouldn't want

03:00.658 --> 03:03.661
to see me in my apron.
[chuckles]

03:08.275 --> 03:09.754
Do we really need
photographic evidence?

03:09.798 --> 03:11.191
Country likes
to be reassured

03:11.234 --> 03:12.670
you're still
at the wheel, sir.

03:12.714 --> 03:14.368
Alison, can you take over?

03:14.411 --> 03:16.108
I have to tend
to my day job.

03:16.152 --> 03:18.110
Hey.
ELIZABETH: Hey.ALISON: No problem.

03:18.154 --> 03:20.287
PDB.DALTON: Two minutes...

03:20.330 --> 03:22.724
Not a bad idea for your country
to see you, uh,

03:22.767 --> 03:24.247
next to the president preparing

03:24.291 --> 03:25.901
to be their next leader.

03:25.944 --> 03:28.382
I knew I shouldn't have told
you guys I was running,

03:28.425 --> 03:29.818
Russell.

03:29.861 --> 03:32.342
Well, you know what?
Go ahead.

03:32.386 --> 03:35.258
I got work
to do, anyway.

03:35.302 --> 03:36.868
Colluder.

03:36.912 --> 03:38.827
No. I've got to prepare
for that panel

03:38.870 --> 03:42.091
on religion and
democracy in tandem

03:42.134 --> 03:44.441
with your India state visit--
What? What'd I do?

03:44.485 --> 03:46.965
When I get back I'm gonna
beat you in badminton.[scoffs]

03:47.009 --> 03:48.880
Badly.
HENRY:
Yeah, you're gonna try.

03:51.274 --> 03:53.711
DANA:
HUMINT indicates the Indian
government has decided not

03:53.755 --> 03:57.106
to take any definitive actions
to quell Hindu nationalists

03:57.149 --> 04:00.762
from violently attacking members
of India's Muslim minority.

04:00.805 --> 04:04.113
In fact, a variety of sources
indicate the Indian government

04:04.156 --> 04:06.202
is siding with the
Hindu nationalists,

04:06.246 --> 04:07.421
and has deemed any responses

04:07.464 --> 04:08.857
that could prevent
further attacks

04:08.900 --> 04:11.294
as politically dangerous.

04:11.338 --> 04:12.556
ELIZABETH:
Well,

04:12.600 --> 04:13.731
that's disappointing.

04:13.775 --> 04:15.298
Yeah, but are you surprised?

04:15.342 --> 04:17.300
[sighs]

04:17.344 --> 04:20.608
I want to issue a public rebuke.

04:20.651 --> 04:22.087
Condemning the Indian
government's

04:22.131 --> 04:25.787
insufficient response to
violence against its citizens.

04:25.830 --> 04:27.745
RUSSELL: Do we really
want to embarrass

04:27.789 --> 04:30.748
Prime Minister Khatri on
the eve of her U.S. trip?

04:30.792 --> 04:33.011
It's just a question.

04:35.492 --> 04:37.973
Do it, Bess.

04:38.016 --> 04:39.279
What else, Dana?

04:39.322 --> 04:42.064
At 0500, FBI SWAT,
alongside ATF,

04:42.107 --> 04:45.328
raided the home of APF leader
Angus Gardner.

04:45.372 --> 04:47.678
Suspects were apprehended
without incident.

04:47.722 --> 04:48.897
APF.

04:48.940 --> 04:51.116
It's Aryan Popular Force.

04:51.160 --> 04:52.901
It's the white
nationalist group

04:52.944 --> 04:55.643
that firebombed that
refugee processing center

04:55.686 --> 04:57.993
when we passed our, uh,
immigration bill.

04:58.036 --> 04:59.995
I guess India hasn't
cornered the market

05:00.038 --> 05:01.692
on violent nationalism.

05:02.954 --> 05:05.174
No.

05:05.217 --> 05:06.828
[elevator bell chimes]

05:06.871 --> 05:08.177
MATT: Ma'am.DAISY: Welcome back.

05:08.220 --> 05:09.396
BLAKE: Welcome back,
Madam Secretary.

05:09.439 --> 05:11.267
Wish I could say
it's good to be back,

05:11.311 --> 05:13.748
but, ah, that beach.

05:13.791 --> 05:15.271
DAISY: Oh, and
those beach looks.

05:15.315 --> 05:17.360
I love that
floral print cover-up.

05:17.404 --> 05:18.796
And that house.

05:18.840 --> 05:19.971
BLAKE:
Oh, to die.

05:20.015 --> 05:21.451
Okay, that is still
the weird part.

05:21.495 --> 05:24.367
Someone's vacation as news.

05:24.411 --> 05:25.716
It did look very

05:25.760 --> 05:27.327
future-presidential
candidatey, ma'am.

05:27.370 --> 05:28.632
Hey. No P-word.

05:28.676 --> 05:30.634
Just saying.[sighs]

05:30.678 --> 05:33.115
No getting out over
our skis, people, okay?

05:33.158 --> 05:36.205
Wait. Aren't you supposed to
lean forward over your skis?

05:36.248 --> 05:38.076
Do any of you
actually ski?

05:38.120 --> 05:39.077
No.
No.

05:39.121 --> 05:41.428
You have time to ski?

05:41.471 --> 05:43.343
Absolutely not.
Mm.

05:43.386 --> 05:44.909
I left a draft statement

05:44.953 --> 05:46.781
of your India-scolding
on your desk.ELIZABETH: Great.

05:46.824 --> 05:50.175
I want it out this morning
before the delegation arrives.

05:50.219 --> 05:52.047
Ma'am.

05:52.090 --> 05:53.657
It looks like your back channel
effort to get Pakistan

05:53.701 --> 05:55.877
to the table on denuclearizing
the subcontinent

05:55.920 --> 05:57.095
has borne fruit.

05:57.139 --> 05:59.141
Oh, and, hi, welcome back.

05:59.184 --> 06:01.099
No. It's o-okay. I like
that kind of welcome.

06:01.143 --> 06:03.928
What, uh, what kind
of fruit are we talking?

06:03.972 --> 06:05.234
I just spoke
to Anjit Marwat,

06:05.277 --> 06:06.801
Pakistan's minister
of foreign affairs.

06:06.844 --> 06:09.760
They're open to bilateral
nuclear disarmament with India

06:09.804 --> 06:12.110
if we can guarantee
their water supply flowing

06:12.154 --> 06:14.025
from India-controlled Kashmir.

06:14.069 --> 06:15.462
DAISY:
Timing's not great

06:15.505 --> 06:17.028
with your India-scolding.

06:19.379 --> 06:22.251
Well, you're right.

06:29.301 --> 06:31.303
Yeah. Matt, uh,

06:31.347 --> 06:33.480
re-craft that statement,
just softening the language.

06:33.523 --> 06:36.308
Um, yes, ma'am.

06:36.352 --> 06:37.788
JAY: Ma'am, anything less
than an unqualified

06:37.832 --> 06:40.356
condemnation of violence
against the Muslim minority

06:40.400 --> 06:41.966
will look like...I know how it looks.

06:42.010 --> 06:45.927
But a chance to eliminate
nuclear weapons

06:45.970 --> 06:48.320
on the subcontinent
makes all parties safer,

06:48.364 --> 06:50.975
including
oppressed minorities.

06:53.543 --> 06:55.980
Let's-- Come on.
Get going on it, please.Yeah.

07:04.859 --> 07:07.078
[coffee pot rattling]

07:07.122 --> 07:08.819
Will you be wrapping up
that project

07:08.863 --> 07:10.821
any time soon?
Oh.

07:10.865 --> 07:11.822
I'm almost done.

07:11.866 --> 07:13.128
Is it distracting you?

07:13.171 --> 07:15.173
I don't distract;
it's bothering me.

07:15.217 --> 07:17.611
Oh.

07:17.654 --> 07:20.178
I guess Adele is used to people
flitting in and out.

07:20.222 --> 07:22.093
He didn't have an intern
when I was here.

07:22.137 --> 07:25.793
So how much, uh, how much
longer will Adele be out?

07:25.836 --> 07:27.142
11 days.

07:27.185 --> 07:29.840
It's her first real vacation
in four years.

07:29.884 --> 07:31.146
I warned her
it would never happen

07:31.189 --> 07:32.408
if she didn't pack up
and leave.

07:32.452 --> 07:34.845
Yeah. We were both surprised.

07:36.543 --> 07:38.588
Oh, I, uh,
I hear that you're thinking

07:38.632 --> 07:41.069
of moving full time
to Palm Beach.

07:41.112 --> 07:42.766
That's Oscar's dream.

07:42.810 --> 07:44.812
He won't step foot
out of Florida.

07:44.855 --> 07:46.727
I'm keeping the place
in Bethesda.

07:46.770 --> 07:47.989
Oh, uh, June.

07:48.032 --> 07:49.512
Get something casual
on the books

07:49.556 --> 07:51.862
with Senator Pratt
this weekend-- liquids,

07:51.906 --> 07:53.081
no food.

07:53.124 --> 07:56.432
And RSVP "no" to
Chip Harding's wedding.

07:56.476 --> 07:58.129
I'll catch the next one.

07:58.173 --> 08:01.393
Make sure the DNI includes
an Aryan Popular Force update

08:01.437 --> 08:03.308
for tomorrow's PDB.

08:03.352 --> 08:04.614
Oh, uh,

08:04.658 --> 08:06.442
coordinate a briefing

08:06.486 --> 08:10.141
on SecState's
Pakistani situation with...

08:14.581 --> 08:16.539
What in God's name is that?

08:16.583 --> 08:20.630
Oh. Um, the coffee machine
was on its last leg,

08:20.674 --> 08:24.373
and since you're trying to wean
yourself off of coffee, anyway,

08:24.416 --> 08:26.767
I thought a tea station
might be a better option.

08:26.810 --> 08:28.420
Um, particularly
matcha green tea,

08:28.464 --> 08:29.683
which has a number
of health benefits.

08:29.726 --> 08:31.293
Okay.

08:31.336 --> 08:34.992
Um, first of all,
don't ever use the word

08:35.036 --> 08:38.387
"wean" in a sentence
involving me again.

08:38.430 --> 08:40.041
Second of all, don't ever
use the word "matcha"

08:40.084 --> 08:42.173
in a sentence
involving me.
Okay.

08:42.217 --> 08:44.175
Just get the old machine back.

08:44.219 --> 08:46.961
Decaf is enough of a compromise.

08:48.876 --> 08:51.531
Coordinate the briefing
with Secretary of State McCord,

08:51.574 --> 08:54.403
Energy Secretary Singer,
and the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee.

08:54.446 --> 08:58.581
Yes. And find me a geological
map of Kashmir, but, uh...

08:58.625 --> 09:00.061
A big one,
not that little printout

09:00.104 --> 09:01.410
from the Internet.

09:01.453 --> 09:02.585
Thank you.

09:04.500 --> 09:07.242
You'll get it, dear.

09:10.767 --> 09:12.987
If it's, uh, not too much
of an inconvenience,

09:13.030 --> 09:14.597
I have a doctor's appointment

09:14.641 --> 09:16.599
day after tomorrow at noon.
I can just work through

09:16.643 --> 09:18.035
and make that my...What's wrong with you?

09:18.079 --> 09:20.603
What?Are you sick?

09:20.647 --> 09:22.213
Oh, no. I just go in,

09:22.257 --> 09:24.128
you know, once a year;
it's a regular checkup.

09:24.172 --> 09:26.391
[muttering]
Don't overshare, dear.

09:26.435 --> 09:28.524
Okay. [fanfare music plays]

prioritizing a nuclear deal,

12:04.593 --> 12:07.683

to ethnic violence

really worth that risk?

Okay.

12:15.038 --> 12:16.648
First of all, long shot?

It's maybe a...

12:19.216 --> 12:22.002
a fairly distant shot, yeah.

the recent violence,

White House statement
for your review

20:25.963 --> 20:27.400
before it goes to press.

20:27.443 --> 20:29.271
Statement about...?

20:29.315 --> 20:31.012
The protests.

20:31.055 --> 20:32.318
Protests large enough

20:32.361 --> 20:33.536
to require a statement
just in the 30 minutes

20:33.580 --> 20:34.842
I've been in a meeting?

20:34.885 --> 20:37.279
The revitalized talks
between India and Pakistan

20:37.323 --> 20:39.673
somehow leaked.
Now there's mass mobilization

20:39.716 --> 20:42.328
in the streets of India
and outside the embassy.

20:42.371 --> 20:44.199
All right, that looks
suitably vague.

20:44.243 --> 20:45.679
We've also been informed

20:45.722 --> 20:46.854
that the Indian delegates
have been forced

20:46.897 --> 20:48.682
to cut their visit short.All right.

20:48.725 --> 20:50.988
No one is leaving without
a commitment in writing

20:51.032 --> 20:52.381
to continue the talks.

20:52.425 --> 20:55.297
And tell the staff they'll
need all hands on deck

20:55.341 --> 20:56.690
to prepare a Memorandum
of Understanding.

20:56.733 --> 21:00.215
Hi. Here is your morning decaf.

21:00.259 --> 21:03.305
I'm very sorry it's late,
the traffic was nuts.

21:07.353 --> 21:09.703
Is he... okay?

21:09.746 --> 21:12.314
Sure. So...

21:12.358 --> 21:14.316
how'd the interview go?

21:16.362 --> 21:17.841
What interview?

21:17.885 --> 21:19.234
Congresswoman Kane.

21:19.278 --> 21:21.105
I told you,
I had a doctor's appointment.

21:21.149 --> 21:23.369
First of all, every
doctor's appointment

21:23.412 --> 21:24.805
at the noon hour
is a job interview.

21:24.848 --> 21:27.373
Secondly, I've been
doing triathlons

21:27.416 --> 21:29.766
with Lois, the security guard
at the Rayburn,

21:29.810 --> 21:31.377
for over 30 years.Oh.

21:31.420 --> 21:33.944
Russell likes to make a big deal
of how nothing gets by him.

21:33.988 --> 21:35.859
That's 'cause
nothing gets by me.

21:35.903 --> 21:38.427
Or Adele, whom
I handpicked

21:38.471 --> 21:40.211
and trained.

21:40.255 --> 21:42.213
So?

21:42.257 --> 21:44.390
She offered me the job.

21:44.433 --> 21:46.696
And I'm considering it.

21:46.740 --> 21:48.829
I would get to be
a legislative correspondent

21:48.872 --> 21:51.571
right away, and she made
a pretty good case for taking me

21:51.614 --> 21:56.445
off of coffee runs and...
putting me in the action.

21:56.489 --> 21:58.360
What do you think?

21:58.404 --> 22:00.231
Well... [scoffs]

22:00.275 --> 22:02.146
Of course she
offered you the job.

22:02.190 --> 22:03.539
You're a hot ticket.

22:03.583 --> 22:07.195
You have an inside track
to the White House,

22:07.238 --> 22:10.198
not to mention a direct
line to your mother.

22:10.241 --> 22:13.288
This town'll take connections
over anything else,

22:13.332 --> 22:17.336
so if you're going
to allow yourself to be poached,

22:17.379 --> 22:20.600
hold out for your best offer.

22:20.643 --> 22:23.254
Okay. Thanks.

22:23.298 --> 22:25.909
No problem.

22:28.564 --> 22:32.307
At 11:15 this morning, POTUS
signed Executive Order 16291

22:32.351 --> 22:34.657
to create a subsidy program
for U.S. companies

22:34.701 --> 22:36.442
to expand their footprint
in India.

22:36.485 --> 22:38.574
This, on top
of Congress fast-tracking

22:38.618 --> 22:40.315
an India free trade agreement,

22:40.359 --> 22:42.099
was the final piece
of the puzzle,

22:42.143 --> 22:44.885
and Prime Minister Khatri
has agreed to all terms

22:44.928 --> 22:47.191
of the India-Pakistan
Denuclearization MOU.

22:47.235 --> 22:49.106
Yeah, that's what
I'm talking about.

22:49.150 --> 22:51.282
Pakistani Prime Minister Wadeyla
will be boarding

22:51.326 --> 22:53.589
his plane later today
at 2200 local time

22:53.633 --> 22:55.417
out of Allama Iqbal Airport
in Lahore.

22:55.461 --> 22:57.985
He'll arrive
at Andrews

22:58.028 --> 23:00.422
at 0800 tomorrow and proceed
directly to the White House

23:00.466 --> 23:01.641
for the signing ceremony.
Congrats, everyone.

23:01.684 --> 23:03.338
[applause]

23:03.382 --> 23:06.341
ELIZABETH: Hey. Hey!
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

23:06.385 --> 23:11.172
All parties have taken enormous
risks to get to "yes" on this.

23:11.215 --> 23:14.305
I want to anticipate
every possible problem

23:14.349 --> 23:16.351
and have solutions
locked and loaded.

23:16.395 --> 23:19.702
No victory laps until this
sucker's signed, all right?

23:19.746 --> 23:20.921
MATT:
Yes, ma'am.

23:20.964 --> 23:22.357
ELIZABETH:
And now,

23:22.401 --> 23:24.707
I get to have lunch
with Russell Jackson. Excuse me.

23:24.751 --> 23:30.365
Look, the way you got this
whole thing over the finish line

23:30.409 --> 23:34.369
was very presidential,
but you wouldn't have had to go

23:34.413 --> 23:37.372
to such extraordinary lengths
if Henry hadn't said

23:37.416 --> 23:40.331
whatever-the-hell
on that panel.

23:40.375 --> 23:43.813
Well, it wasn't
great timing,

23:43.857 --> 23:47.600
but I didn't disagree
with a word he said.

23:47.643 --> 23:50.124
You know I respect Henry,

23:50.167 --> 23:52.169
but you need him to be

23:52.213 --> 23:54.998
on the same page
as you... publicly.

23:58.437 --> 24:00.439
I still have a year.

24:00.482 --> 24:02.136
Yeah, well,
practice makes perfect.

24:02.179 --> 24:06.575
Unless you've convinced your
family that they're in it too,

24:06.619 --> 24:08.882
you won't win.

24:08.925 --> 24:10.927
It's as simple as that.

24:12.363 --> 24:16.063
You can't afford
to have Henry go rogue.

24:24.375 --> 24:25.507
[Elizabeth sighs]

24:25.551 --> 24:27.074
Morning.

24:27.117 --> 24:30.033
Oh, hey. Morning. I'm sorry
I didn't wake you up last night.

24:30.077 --> 24:32.906
I was torturing my staff,

24:32.949 --> 24:35.299
coming up with... [sighs]

24:35.343 --> 24:37.476
contingencies for
our contingencies.

24:37.519 --> 24:39.347
Well, never apologize
for not waking me up.

24:39.390 --> 24:43.438
Yeah. Listen, um, I got to run,
so, I'll talk to you later.

24:43.482 --> 24:45.005
Wait, wait.
What is it?

24:45.048 --> 24:47.442
Is it because I wasn't here
when Minister Samant came over?

24:47.486 --> 24:48.661
Because I thought
you understood

24:48.704 --> 24:50.314
I wasn't going
to apologize.
No, no, I do.

24:50.358 --> 24:52.055
I did. I did. It's just...I mean, it would have
been awkward

24:52.099 --> 24:53.492
if I was to hang around...Look, I have to go, but...

24:53.535 --> 24:57.147
Henry, if-if I'm gonna
enter a political campaign,

24:57.191 --> 24:58.932
we need to be
on the same page.

24:58.975 --> 25:03.023
You mean I need to be
on the same page as you?

25:03.066 --> 25:04.807
[stammers] You really think...Henry...

25:04.851 --> 25:06.417
...I should have
turned a blind eye

25:06.461 --> 25:08.202
to global extremism...Is that what you
think I'm doing?

25:08.245 --> 25:10.421
...all for the sake
of an arms deal?Turning a blind eye?

25:10.465 --> 25:12.423
Oh, for a mere arms deal?

25:12.467 --> 25:14.425
No, that's not what I mean.
It's just, look...

25:14.469 --> 25:16.689
I shouldn't be putting this
on you, but...Do you, do you think

25:16.732 --> 25:20.388
it's possible that the trauma
of the false nuclear attack

25:20.431 --> 25:21.868
could be affecting you
on this?

25:21.911 --> 25:23.173
It was only
a couple of months ago...

25:23.217 --> 25:24.653
I don't have time to be
analyzed right now.

25:24.697 --> 25:27.526
Henry, I'm... See,
now I'm-I'm late.

25:27.569 --> 25:29.658
I got to... We'll talk
more about it later, okay?

25:29.702 --> 25:31.094
It's gonna be...Okay. Fine. Yeah.

25:31.138 --> 25:33.009
Okay?
Okay.

25:33.053 --> 25:35.490
Congratulations.[door closes]

25:36.535 --> 25:38.711
You ready?

25:38.754 --> 25:41.583
Yes, um, but
if it's okay,

25:41.627 --> 25:43.629
I just need to...

25:43.672 --> 25:46.414
just need to get one
quick thing off my chest.

25:46.457 --> 25:47.633
Sure.

25:47.676 --> 25:49.373
Yesterday when you said

25:49.417 --> 25:51.158
that everyone was
only interested in me

25:51.201 --> 25:53.639
because of my connections
to Russell and my mom...

25:53.682 --> 25:57.251
Well, I didn't say "only,"
but go ahead.

25:57.294 --> 25:58.600
Okay.

25:58.644 --> 26:01.385
But you did say that it
was a big part of it.

26:01.429 --> 26:05.433
Um, I just feel like
that's not really fair.

26:05.476 --> 26:09.350
I work hard, and I've
accomplished a lot here.

26:09.393 --> 26:13.223
I'm-I'm sure that-that when you
were making your way in D.C.,

26:13.267 --> 26:16.357
you sometimes felt
underestimated by people

26:16.400 --> 26:18.881
who didn't fully appreciate
what you had to offer,

26:18.925 --> 26:22.276
and who maybe didn't acknowledge
that you were capable of more,

26:22.319 --> 26:25.888
so you can understand why
I would just like to be treated

26:25.932 --> 26:28.412
with the respect that...

26:28.456 --> 26:31.024
I feel I've earned.

26:32.852 --> 26:35.637
Well, I apologize

26:35.681 --> 26:38.205
if I made you feel
underestimated.

26:38.248 --> 26:40.207
It was not my intention.

26:40.250 --> 26:42.252
Thank you.

26:43.340 --> 26:44.951
And I do understand

26:44.994 --> 26:47.388
that women of your generation
didn't necessarily learn

26:47.431 --> 26:50.043
to be comfortable with ambition
in the same way.

26:50.086 --> 26:52.393
You know, it...
and it can look very obnoxious

26:52.436 --> 26:54.264
and overreaching, but...

26:54.308 --> 26:58.791
we have to demand
more power ourselves, you know?

26:58.834 --> 27:03.622
Otherwise, we just all get
stuck serving powerful men.

27:07.190 --> 27:09.105
I don't mean to say
that that's what...

27:09.149 --> 27:11.368
that's what all women
of your generation have done.

27:11.412 --> 27:14.154
Also didn't mean
to use the word "stuck."

27:14.197 --> 27:16.896
It's...

27:16.939 --> 27:18.898
It's fine.

27:18.941 --> 27:21.378
We really have to go.

27:29.386 --> 27:31.388
ELIZABETH:
Hey, Mike, I'm already late,

27:31.432 --> 27:32.868
so whatever you can do

27:32.912 --> 27:35.175
to get me to the West
Wing as soon as possible.

27:35.218 --> 27:36.480
That would be great, okay?Yes, ma'am.

27:36.524 --> 27:37.873
Welcome, Chondita.

27:37.917 --> 27:39.875
Mr. President.Please.

27:39.919 --> 27:41.268
Pens...

27:41.311 --> 27:43.400
Kind of important
for a signing ceremony,

27:43.444 --> 27:46.055
don't you think?

27:49.102 --> 27:51.104
Oh, crap.

27:51.147 --> 27:52.888
[cameras clicking]

27:52.932 --> 27:54.716
[phone ringing]

27:56.196 --> 27:57.719
[tires squeal]

27:57.763 --> 28:00.374
What the hell was that?

28:00.417 --> 28:01.810
AGENT:
Castle, this is DS.
Are you under fire?

28:01.854 --> 28:03.246
AGENT 2:
Affirmative. Protect Bluebird.

28:03.290 --> 28:05.031
Copy. Nearest entrance
to the PEOC...

28:05.074 --> 28:07.468
ELIZABETH: No, no, no, no.
I have to... No, no, no.

28:07.511 --> 28:09.339
I need to be there.White House is taking fire.

28:09.383 --> 28:11.037
Need to get to the Presidential
Emergency Ops Center.

28:11.080 --> 28:12.081
We have to evacuate.

28:17.173 --> 28:19.175
[high-pitched ringing]

28:24.964 --> 28:26.966
[distant alarm blaring]

28:30.926 --> 28:32.536
[indistinct chatter]

28:32.580 --> 28:33.755
Are you okay?

28:33.799 --> 28:34.974
This way.

28:35.017 --> 28:36.627
[indistinct chatter continues]

28:36.671 --> 28:39.892
Right this way.

28:39.935 --> 28:41.763
Medics are outside.

28:41.807 --> 28:43.547
MAN:
Evacuate. Everyone evacuate.

28:43.591 --> 28:45.593
[June whimpering]

28:53.209 --> 28:55.255
June?

28:55.298 --> 28:57.213
June.

28:57.257 --> 28:58.693
[gasps]

28:58.737 --> 29:00.782
Can you get up?

29:05.047 --> 29:07.397
June, I'm gonna get help.

29:07.441 --> 29:09.051
I'm gonna go get help, okay?

29:09.095 --> 29:10.313
I'll be back.

29:10.357 --> 29:12.141
Help!Ms. McCord.

29:12.185 --> 29:14.796
There's someone in there
who needs help.
Ms. McCord.

29:14.840 --> 29:15.928
Oh.
Come with me.

29:15.971 --> 29:16.842
There's someone-- No.No, no, no, no.

29:16.885 --> 29:18.582
STEVIE:
No, no, no, no!

29:18.626 --> 29:19.192
I got her.
I got her, I got her.

29:19.235 --> 29:19.888
Come on, let's go.

29:19.932 --> 29:21.934
June. June, she's...

29:21.977 --> 29:23.979
[alarm blaring]

29:24.023 --> 29:28.157
Medic! Medic!

29:28.201 --> 29:30.943
[siren wailing]RUSSELL: No. I opted

29:30.986 --> 29:34.120
out of continuity of governance,
but POTUS, VPOTUS are safe,

29:34.163 --> 29:36.644
and the FBI, ATF...
Russell?

29:36.687 --> 29:38.211
...and the speaker--
I'll call you back.Where is she?

29:38.254 --> 29:40.300
She's in surgery.[stammering]:
Well, is she okay?

29:40.343 --> 29:41.867
Ambulance got here
in minutes.

29:41.910 --> 29:43.825
Did you talk to the doctors?Some of the best trauma surgeons

29:43.869 --> 29:45.087
in the country
are working on her.

29:45.131 --> 29:45.871
But is, is she...
is she conscious?

29:45.914 --> 29:47.089
Does she...?
Is she...?

29:47.133 --> 29:49.265
She lost a lot
of blood, Henry.

29:51.311 --> 29:53.139
Sorry.

29:54.575 --> 29:55.881
What the hell happened?

29:55.924 --> 29:57.273
[sighs]
Intel is sketchy.

29:57.317 --> 29:59.536
It looks like
someone launched an RPG

29:59.580 --> 30:01.060
from a rooftop
a few blocks away.

30:01.103 --> 30:02.278
You were asking for an
update on Stephanie McCord's...

30:02.322 --> 30:03.627
Yeah, this is her father.

30:03.671 --> 30:05.020
Dr. Delgado.Hello.

30:05.064 --> 30:06.674
Is she out
of surgery?
Not yet.

30:06.717 --> 30:08.328
We've stopped the bleeding,
but the surgeon

30:08.371 --> 30:11.331
found a shard of glass
wedged against an artery.

30:11.374 --> 30:12.898
It's a delicate procedure.[phone vibrating]

30:12.941 --> 30:15.074
They have to remove the glass
without rupturing the artery.

30:15.117 --> 30:17.511
But she's going
to be okay?

30:17.554 --> 30:19.687
She's in really
good hands.

30:19.730 --> 30:24.518
MAN [over P.A.]:
Dr. Delgado, please pick up
line two, extension 425.

30:24.561 --> 30:26.172
Dr. Delgado, line two...

30:26.215 --> 30:27.477
You'll let me know

30:27.521 --> 30:29.305
as soon as you hear
something, right? And...

30:29.349 --> 30:31.568
I love you, too.

30:31.612 --> 30:33.483
I got to go.
Bess.

30:33.527 --> 30:36.486
We're going to get you to the
hospital as soon as we can.

30:36.530 --> 30:38.880
Yes. It's okay.
What's the latest?

30:38.924 --> 30:42.188
FBI's quick and dirty assessment
is a Hindu nationalist cell

30:42.231 --> 30:44.320
or possibly Pakistani ex-pats

30:44.364 --> 30:47.454
upset with the nuclear
deal got off a lucky shot.

30:47.497 --> 30:50.544
Does the CIA analyst in
you buy that theory?

30:50.587 --> 30:52.154
It's possible.

30:52.198 --> 30:54.374
Though I question any group

30:54.417 --> 30:57.899
planning, arming up and
executing in a couple of days.

30:57.943 --> 30:59.640
Mr. President?

30:59.683 --> 31:02.034
FBI giving chase
to suspected attackers.

31:03.774 --> 31:05.864
[sirens wailing]

31:07.517 --> 31:10.694
MAN: Step out of the vehicle
with your hands up.

31:10.738 --> 31:12.044
Now in Hindi and Urdu.

31:12.087 --> 31:13.784
WOMAN:
Copy that.

31:13.828 --> 31:15.961
[woman shouting in Hindi]

31:21.357 --> 31:23.664
[gunfire continues]

31:23.707 --> 31:26.188
[distant siren wailing]

31:35.894 --> 31:39.375
I'm sorry
that we've been fighting.

31:39.419 --> 31:41.377
That's on me.
I shouldn't have...

31:41.421 --> 31:43.162
Mm. I'm sorry, too.

31:43.205 --> 31:44.772
[clears throat]
We're fine.

31:49.516 --> 31:51.648
I heard they
caught some guys.

31:51.692 --> 31:53.607
Yeah.

31:53.650 --> 31:56.175
Not what anybody thought.

31:56.218 --> 31:59.178
They weren't Hindu
or Pakistani nationalists.

31:59.221 --> 32:02.790
Do you remember that group
that attacked the refugee center

32:02.833 --> 32:04.661
up in Michigan?Uh, the white...?

32:04.705 --> 32:06.185
White nationalists. Yeah.The Aryan Popular...

32:06.228 --> 32:07.969
Yeah.
...Force. Yeah.

32:08.013 --> 32:10.972
Apparently already aggrieved
over the immigration bill,

32:11.016 --> 32:14.933
and the talk of the trade
agreement with India just...

32:14.976 --> 32:17.979
last straw.

32:18.023 --> 32:21.461
How the hell did
they get an RPG? I...

32:27.032 --> 32:30.949
I'm not asking you
to be someone you're not.

32:30.992 --> 32:33.952
But we'll figure
it out, right?

32:35.083 --> 32:36.737
Why? Are you thinking
of not running?

32:36.780 --> 32:39.131
Why? Are you thinking that?

32:40.175 --> 32:43.396
The thought's
crossed my mind.

32:45.398 --> 32:48.357
I can't think
about anything until...

32:48.401 --> 32:49.968
[sighs]

32:50.011 --> 32:52.796
[whispers]:
...till we know she's okay.

32:54.059 --> 32:56.409
I know.

32:58.541 --> 32:59.542
[sighs]

33:05.157 --> 33:07.028
[sighs]

33:07.072 --> 33:09.813
Stephanie is out of surgery
and doing well.

33:09.857 --> 33:11.119
Is she awake?Is her spine...

33:11.163 --> 33:12.642
We removed the glass
and were able

33:12.686 --> 33:14.862
to repair
the circumflex scapular artery.

33:14.905 --> 33:15.863
It's holding nicely.

33:15.906 --> 33:17.343
She's in recovery,

33:17.386 --> 33:20.955
and her prognosis
is excellent.

33:20.999 --> 33:22.174
Thank you so much.

33:22.217 --> 33:23.827
Thank you.You're welcome.
You're welcome.

33:23.871 --> 33:25.046
[stammers]
Thank you.

33:25.090 --> 33:26.874
And so we'll-- Okay.

33:26.917 --> 33:28.484
Okay.

33:31.444 --> 33:33.663
Hey, baby girl.

33:33.707 --> 33:36.579
Hi. Hi, honey.[chuckles]: Hi.

33:36.623 --> 33:38.016
You okay?Oh, baby,

33:38.059 --> 33:40.366
how are you feeling?I...

33:40.409 --> 33:43.978
probably look the way
that I feel.

33:45.023 --> 33:47.025
So, gorgeous then, huh?

33:47.068 --> 33:48.417
You feeling...[chuckles softly]

33:48.461 --> 33:49.940
The doctor said you're
gonna be better than new.

33:49.984 --> 33:52.508
They put a GPS chip
right in your shoulder.

33:52.552 --> 33:54.206
[chuckles, whimpers]

33:56.164 --> 33:59.080
Please-please
don't make me laugh.

34:00.125 --> 34:01.865
Let's-- Can we get you
something?

34:01.909 --> 34:03.867
How 'bout some pillows?
Okay? Let me...

34:03.911 --> 34:05.434
[sighs]
You know Mom and pillows.

34:05.478 --> 34:06.957
Here we go.[weakly]: No.

34:07.001 --> 34:08.959
There's gonna be
a lot of 'em.

34:09.003 --> 34:10.570
STEVIE:
I'm fine.

34:10.613 --> 34:12.354
Here we go.

34:12.398 --> 34:14.008
Uh, here, Henry.
Fluff that one.

34:16.271 --> 34:18.273
How's June?

34:37.771 --> 34:39.642
[inhales deeply]

34:39.686 --> 34:41.688
[sighs]

34:44.125 --> 34:47.085
Oscar, Russell Jackson.

34:47.128 --> 34:49.609
I'm afraid the news is not good.

34:51.132 --> 34:53.830
June passed away during surgery.

34:53.874 --> 34:56.094
I'm so sorry.

35:00.707 --> 35:02.012
My, uh...

35:02.056 --> 35:05.015
my office can take care
of your travel or...

35:05.059 --> 35:06.843
we can make other arrangements.

35:06.887 --> 35:09.019
Just let me know.

35:09.063 --> 35:10.978
Whatever I can do.

35:14.373 --> 35:16.984
I loved her, too.

35:19.378 --> 35:21.031
[choked up]:
Okay.

35:21.075 --> 35:22.990
Yeah.

35:27.995 --> 35:30.171
[inhales deeply]

35:30.215 --> 35:31.999
[sighs]

35:35.220 --> 35:36.743
Are they all here?

35:36.786 --> 35:38.223
Yes, ma'am.

35:38.266 --> 35:39.963
I let them wait in your office.
I hope you don't mind.

35:40.007 --> 35:42.401
[chuckles]
Was theirs, too.

35:44.707 --> 35:45.926
WOMAN:
I hate all of this...

35:45.969 --> 35:47.710
Hi. I'm so sorry
to keep you waiting.

35:47.754 --> 35:49.277
Thank you for coming.

35:49.321 --> 35:51.453
[chuckles] Hi.How's Stevie?

35:51.497 --> 35:53.977
Well, she's better, so...Oh, good. Good.

35:54.021 --> 35:55.979
Is she home yet?No, not yet.

35:56.023 --> 35:57.329
Oh.Thank you, Secretary Clinton.

35:57.372 --> 35:59.200
Our prayers are all with you.

35:59.244 --> 36:02.116
Thank you. I really
appreciate that.[chuckles]

36:02.160 --> 36:04.336
Listen, I-I won't take
much of your time.

36:04.379 --> 36:06.860
I know that you all have
other meetings and...

36:06.903 --> 36:08.166
places to be.Elizabeth, there is

36:08.209 --> 36:09.558
no more important meeting
for any of us

36:09.602 --> 36:10.907
than this one right now.

36:10.951 --> 36:13.388
Well, I-I do
appreciate that.

36:13.432 --> 36:15.956
Come on. Please sit.The kind of time
when people need to...

36:15.999 --> 36:17.218
rally around.

36:17.262 --> 36:18.741
ELIZABETH:
Well...

36:18.785 --> 36:22.354
It's so good of you to consult
with your predecessors.

36:22.397 --> 36:24.704
We did it all the time,
so thanks for asking us.

36:24.747 --> 36:27.315
Well, again, uh,

36:27.359 --> 36:30.492
the president has asked me
to give a speech

36:30.536 --> 36:32.364
after the signing ceremony

36:32.407 --> 36:34.583
to address the attack
on the White House.

36:34.627 --> 36:36.106
[scoffs]

36:36.150 --> 36:38.370
You bear a heavy
burden, Elizabeth.

36:38.413 --> 36:40.328
The whole world
will be watching you.

36:40.372 --> 36:42.112
No pressure.

36:42.156 --> 36:44.202
[laughs]Thanks for that
reminder. Yeah.

36:44.245 --> 36:45.855
Right. No pressure.

36:45.899 --> 36:47.553
Well,

36:47.596 --> 36:51.731
what do you say in the wake
of a nightmare like this?

36:51.774 --> 36:53.385
You need to
reassure the people

36:53.428 --> 36:55.909
that they are safe,
because we are resolute

36:55.952 --> 36:57.563
in our efforts
to defeat this enemy.

36:57.606 --> 36:58.738
ALBRIGHT:
Well, that's a start.

36:58.781 --> 37:01.044
But I think
we also have to remember

37:01.088 --> 37:03.743
that those who attacked us
are resolute, too.

37:03.786 --> 37:06.441
CLINTON: And you will
have to reassure people

37:06.485 --> 37:08.269
about their safety.

37:08.313 --> 37:10.967
Um, you can remind them
that we do have

37:11.011 --> 37:13.840
the world's greatest military
to protect

37:13.883 --> 37:15.798
and defend them.POWELL: But, you know,
as great as our military

37:15.842 --> 37:19.237
power is, that is not where
our real strength lies.

37:19.280 --> 37:20.542
CLINTON:
Absolutely.

37:20.586 --> 37:23.545
Our strength lies
in our core democratic values.

37:23.589 --> 37:24.894
In our Constitution.

37:24.938 --> 37:27.767
ALBRIGHT: Elizabeth,
I was a little girl in London

37:27.810 --> 37:30.987
during World War II
when the Germans were bombing.

37:31.031 --> 37:32.946
I learned later
that three

37:32.989 --> 37:35.949
of my grandparents
were murdered by the Nazis

37:35.992 --> 37:37.472
in concentration camps.

37:37.516 --> 37:41.302
And so the threat of nationalism
is not just a theory.

37:41.346 --> 37:42.608
I went through it once,

37:42.651 --> 37:44.784
and I don't intend
to go through it again.

37:44.827 --> 37:47.787
POWELL: The nationalistic
threat is really expanding,

37:47.830 --> 37:51.791
and more and more countries
are being caught in this trap.

37:51.834 --> 37:53.532
It's contagious.

37:53.575 --> 37:55.534
It splits us apart. It
makes it more difficult

37:55.577 --> 37:58.319
to deal with the issue, and it
becomes even more contagious.

37:58.363 --> 37:59.929
They attack
what has made

37:59.973 --> 38:03.019
America great, uh--
and still does--

38:03.063 --> 38:04.499
and that is our diversity.

38:04.543 --> 38:06.196
I mean, look at, look at us.

38:06.240 --> 38:08.416
The attackers wanted
to destroy that.

38:08.460 --> 38:09.548
To divide us.

38:09.591 --> 38:11.332
So, you know, Elizabeth,

38:11.376 --> 38:14.988
I think what we're all saying
is talk about what unites us.

38:15.031 --> 38:17.295
Even at this moment
of peril,

38:17.338 --> 38:19.558
remind Americans
of our nation's

38:19.601 --> 38:20.994
original motto,

38:21.037 --> 38:22.996
something that I think
about a lot

38:23.039 --> 38:25.259
and which seems more important
today than ever:

38:25.303 --> 38:27.000
e pluribus unum.[chuckles softly]

38:27.043 --> 38:28.741
Out of many, one.

38:28.784 --> 38:30.090
ALBRIGHT:
Hillary, you're so right.

38:30.133 --> 38:32.092
Because we all, unified,

38:32.135 --> 38:33.876
depend on each other.

38:33.920 --> 38:35.704
America. Americans.

38:35.748 --> 38:36.836
All Americans.

38:36.879 --> 38:38.185
All Americans.

38:39.229 --> 38:41.144
All of us.

38:46.280 --> 38:50.284
DALTON: Secretary of State
Elizabeth McCord,

38:50.328 --> 38:52.895
who worked diligently
to bring us all here today,

38:52.939 --> 38:56.290
is a master of keeping
the biggest picture in mind

38:56.334 --> 38:57.683
at all times.

38:57.726 --> 39:00.686
I rely on her for that.

39:00.729 --> 39:03.036
And now I have asked her
to say a few words

39:03.079 --> 39:04.080
along those lines.

39:04.124 --> 39:06.779
Madam Secretary.

39:06.822 --> 39:09.390
[cameras clicking]Thank you, Mr. President.

39:09.434 --> 39:10.783
And thank you, Prime Minister

39:10.826 --> 39:12.741
Khatri and
Prime Minister Wadeyla.

39:12.785 --> 39:16.354
Your courage and determination
have made humankind safer

39:16.397 --> 39:20.358
from the second greatest threat
it faces.

39:20.401 --> 39:24.927
What is an even greater threat
than nuclear weapons?

39:24.971 --> 39:28.844
That which makes the use
of them possible.

39:28.888 --> 39:31.281
Hate.

39:31.325 --> 39:33.936
Specifically,
the blind hatred

39:33.980 --> 39:37.200
one group or nation
can have for another.

39:37.244 --> 39:39.420
And that is why
I am convinced

39:39.464 --> 39:43.685
that nationalism is the
existential threat of our time.

39:43.729 --> 39:45.383
I want to be clear.

39:45.426 --> 39:48.951
Nationalism is not the same
as patriotism.

39:48.995 --> 39:52.302
It's a perversion of patriotism.

39:52.346 --> 39:55.741
Nationalism, the belief system
held by those

39:55.784 --> 39:58.874
who attacked us, promotes
the idea that inclusion

39:58.918 --> 40:01.094
and diversity
represent weakness,

40:01.137 --> 40:04.010
that the only way to succeed
is to give

40:04.053 --> 40:05.838
blind allegiance
to the supremacy

40:05.881 --> 40:08.928
of one race over all others.

40:08.971 --> 40:12.105
Nothing could be less American.

40:12.148 --> 40:16.501
Patriotism, on the other hand,
is about building each other up

40:16.544 --> 40:18.938
and embracing our diversity

40:18.981 --> 40:21.854
as the source
of our nation's strength.

40:21.897 --> 40:25.945
"We the People" means
allthe people.

40:25.988 --> 40:29.862
America's heroes didn't die
for race or region.

40:29.905 --> 40:33.822
They died for the ideals
enshrined in our Constitution.

40:33.866 --> 40:37.435
Above all, freedom from tyranny,

40:37.478 --> 40:41.656
which requires our unwavering
support of a free press,

40:41.700 --> 40:43.745
freedom of religion--
all religions--

40:43.789 --> 40:46.008
the right to vote,
and making sure

40:46.052 --> 40:49.838
nothing infringes
on any of those rights,

40:49.882 --> 40:52.450
which belong to us all.

40:52.493 --> 40:56.236
Look where isolationism
has gotten us in the past.

40:56.279 --> 40:57.411
Two world wars.

40:57.455 --> 41:00.153
70 million dead.

41:00.196 --> 41:04.244
Never again can we go back
to those dark times

41:04.287 --> 41:06.986
when fear and hatred,

41:07.029 --> 41:08.901
like a contagion,

41:08.944 --> 41:11.730
infected the world.

41:11.773 --> 41:15.560
That, as much as ending
the threat of nuclear war,

41:15.603 --> 41:17.823
is what today is about.

41:17.866 --> 41:21.914
And it's why we must never lose
sight of our common humanity,

41:21.957 --> 41:23.916
our common values,

41:23.959 --> 41:26.919
and our common decency.

41:26.962 --> 41:30.836
I was reminded recently
of our nation's founding motto,

41:30.879 --> 41:32.490
e pluribus unum.

41:32.533 --> 41:35.405
Out of many, one.

41:35.449 --> 41:38.278
13 disparate colonies

41:38.321 --> 41:40.106
became one country, one people.

41:40.149 --> 41:42.761
And, today,
we call on all Americans

41:42.804 --> 41:47.417
and people everywhere to reject
the scourge of nationalism.

41:47.461 --> 41:50.420
Because governments
can't legislate tolerance

41:50.464 --> 41:52.510
or eradicate hate.

41:52.553 --> 41:55.513
That's why each one of us
has to find the beauty

41:55.556 --> 41:58.994
in our differences
instead of the fear.

41:59.038 --> 42:02.258
Listen instead of reacting.

42:02.302 --> 42:06.828
Reach out instead of recoiling.

42:06.872 --> 42:08.656
It's up to us.

42:08.700 --> 42:10.484
All of us.

42:10.528 --> 42:12.530
Thank you.

42:14.880 --> 42:18.231
[applause]

42:18.274 --> 42:20.973
No one could have
said that better.

42:21.016 --> 42:22.931
Thank you, sir.
