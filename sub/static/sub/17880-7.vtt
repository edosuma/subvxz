WEBVTT

00:08.417 --> 00:10.384
Do you think I look like a possum in this shirt?

00:11.804 --> 00:12.929
No.
Why?

00:13.224 --> 00:15.595
My wife went on and on this morning about

00:15.720 --> 00:17.975
how this shirt makes me look like a possum.

00:18.143 --> 00:20.226
Sometimes I don't know how you put up with that woman.

00:20.791 --> 00:23.564
Usually I hold perfectly still until she goes away.

00:25.022 --> 00:26.521
The company has a problem.

00:26.646 --> 00:29.391
A recent survey found employee morale has dropped from "low"

00:29.516 --> 00:32.810
which they were okay with: to "I'd like to burn this place down"

00:32.935 --> 00:35.910
Which, frankly, I'm surprised is one of the options.

00:36.289 --> 00:38.366
This is Clark. He conducted the survey.

00:38.491 --> 00:41.576
Right now he's telling Veronica what the employees think about her,

00:41.701 --> 00:43.972
which means right now, Veronica hates Clark.

00:44.097 --> 00:46.641
63% found you too intimidating.

00:47.047 --> 00:48.881
Is there such a thing as too intimidating?

00:49.531 --> 00:50.424
Is there?

00:50.698 --> 00:52.426
Answer me, you little bean counter.

00:52.767 --> 00:56.305
I've told you three times I don't like being called that.

00:57.442 --> 00:59.642
Sorry. I was told my evaluation was at 11:00.

00:59.810 --> 01:00.998
We're done.

01:01.195 --> 01:04.666
It seems everyone's afraid of me,
which to me, sounds like their problem,

01:04.791 --> 01:06.899
but apparently not.
The company is worried

01:07.067 --> 01:09.104
that a decrease in morale is hurting productivity.

01:09.229 --> 01:11.698
We think it would help if you softened your image a little,

01:11.823 --> 01:15.218
compliment people, be more supportive.
If people feel appreciated,

01:15.343 --> 01:16.450
they work harder.

01:17.010 --> 01:19.743
I'm sure we're all gonna have to make adjustments.

01:20.044 --> 01:21.044
Not you.

01:25.903 --> 01:27.253
Everyone likes me?

01:27.823 --> 01:30.671
You so desperately want to be loved.
No, I don't.

01:31.542 --> 01:33.480
Yes, I do.
I mean, who doesn't?

01:33.605 --> 01:36.935
Mr. Crisp, you had a near-unanimous rating of "excellent."

01:37.060 --> 01:39.557
In fact, there were even several write-ins of "adorable."

01:41.059 --> 01:42.877
Brother. Look out, Jesus.

01:43.857 --> 01:45.663
Wait. "Near-unanimous"...

01:45.788 --> 01:49.108
Does that mean a few less than unanimous or a few more?

01:49.276 --> 01:51.449
Really the only group you didn't score well with

01:51.574 --> 01:53.849
were men over 50 in lower management.

01:53.974 --> 01:57.658
Too bad, Ted. Men over 50 in lower management loved me.

01:57.956 --> 02:00.412
No, they didn't.
Shut up, you little bean counter.

02:00.996 --> 02:03.831
I don't get it. What did I do to men over 50?

02:04.172 --> 02:06.528
You're young, good-looking, successful.

02:06.653 --> 02:08.586
Honestly, they probably just resent you.

02:08.987 --> 02:11.304
Maybe I'll just have to make them get to know me.

02:11.429 --> 02:13.424
I mean, my father's over 50, and he...

02:15.122 --> 02:15.872
Wait.

02:19.144 --> 02:22.103
You wanted to see me, boss?
Yes, employee.

02:22.905 --> 02:25.005
As part of an effort to raise morale,

02:25.130 --> 02:27.646
I've been told to find out what would make our workers happy,

02:28.131 --> 02:30.716
and I thought I'd ask you, since you're the smartest,

02:30.841 --> 02:33.589
most observant person in the whole company.

02:34.286 --> 02:36.821
Let me guess. You've also been told to compliment people.

02:37.868 --> 02:39.366
See how smart you are?

02:39.779 --> 02:40.828
Thank you.

02:40.953 --> 02:44.496
But what makes you think I know
how to make employees happy?

02:44.665 --> 02:46.624
Because you're the suggestion box lady.

02:47.416 --> 02:49.001
They call like that you upstairs.

02:49.374 --> 02:52.896
I've never put my name on any of my helpful but ignored ideas.

02:53.021 --> 02:55.342
How do they know they're from me?
Other people suggested

02:55.467 --> 02:57.468
that you stop hogging the suggestion box.

03:01.859 --> 03:04.225
Sitting out there in those identical cubicles,

03:04.350 --> 03:08.187
people start to feel anonymous. There's no sense of community.

03:08.472 --> 03:10.648
Personally, I've always felt disconnected,

03:10.816 --> 03:13.342
like I'm just some faceless cog in a giant,

03:13.467 --> 03:14.735
dehumanizing machine.

03:15.486 --> 03:16.821
Slow down, chairman mao.

03:17.823 --> 03:19.323
I don't need a manifesto.

03:19.448 --> 03:21.659
I need something to make people happy.

03:23.364 --> 03:27.107
The company could start by letting us individualize our space,

03:27.232 --> 03:30.167
you know, decorate our cubicles, put up photos and artwork.

03:30.853 --> 03:32.336
Really? That's all it would take?

03:33.630 --> 03:35.565
You drones are so easy.

03:36.695 --> 03:38.008
That's not a compliment.

03:41.712 --> 03:42.793
Good morning.

03:44.000 --> 03:50.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:55.595 --> 03:58.737
Rick, I think I've been replaced by someone who likes cats.

04:00.490 --> 04:02.992
My cubicle's been decorated with space stuff.

04:03.393 --> 04:05.953
It's a very aggressive move, but by who?

04:22.039 --> 04:25.018
Nice sweater, Lily. I support your decision to wear it.

04:25.566 --> 04:26.709
Hi, balding guy.

04:26.834 --> 04:29.350
I love what you've done with the hair you have left.

04:31.146 --> 04:33.564
Hello, mob. You look confused.

04:33.732 --> 04:35.905
We were just wondering about our new...

04:36.030 --> 04:37.568
and lovely cubicles.

04:38.062 --> 04:40.571
Linda suggested...
Great. I love where this is going.

04:40.915 --> 04:43.870
That you all be allowed to decorate your workplaces

04:43.995 --> 04:45.703
to express your individuality.

04:45.828 --> 04:47.981
The company thought it would be too risky to just let

04:48.106 --> 04:49.835
people do whatever the hell they wanted,

04:49.960 --> 04:52.285
they've expressed your individuality for you

04:52.410 --> 04:54.835
in four exciting and inoffensive themes...

04:55.246 --> 04:56.670
Green bay packers.

04:57.180 --> 04:58.087
Cats.

04:58.974 --> 04:59.876
Space.

05:00.550 --> 05:02.331
And classic cars.

05:02.677 --> 05:03.957
Isn't that great?

05:04.530 --> 05:06.597
Enjoy your new personalities.

05:08.962 --> 05:10.177
Nice job, Linda.

05:13.766 --> 05:14.731
I know!

05:15.441 --> 05:17.122
Can you believe this place

05:17.247 --> 05:19.845
and the things they do to all of us sometimes?

05:26.983 --> 05:28.045
Teamwork...

05:29.007 --> 05:30.662
it's a beautiful thing.

05:31.540 --> 05:35.499
In business, it means working together for a common goal.

05:36.461 --> 05:39.046
X- rays show that when people work together,

05:39.214 --> 05:40.458
they're happier

05:41.791 --> 05:44.329
and less likely to do something weird...

05:57.445 --> 05:59.650
What about me screams "cat lady" to you?

06:00.107 --> 06:02.903
Maybe the way you pounce on a fella
who's just trying to get cup of coffee.

06:04.272 --> 06:07.755
The company personalized my cubicle with all the stupid cat stuff.

06:07.880 --> 06:11.078
What are they trying to tell me, that I'm gonna die old and alone,

06:11.246 --> 06:13.622
with a hundred cats chewing on my decomposing body?

06:14.355 --> 06:17.875
If you fed the cats once in a while,
your story would have a happier ending.

06:18.086 --> 06:20.480
Would you just say they're wrong about me, please?

06:20.605 --> 06:24.411
In spite of what my new poster says,
I'm having trouble hanging in there.

06:24.536 --> 06:26.531
The company does all sorts of crazy things.

06:26.656 --> 06:28.845
That doesn't mean we have to be crazy, too.

06:29.310 --> 06:32.181
Now if you'll excuse me, I have
to go seduce a 55-year-old man.

06:35.078 --> 06:36.854
Manny, right? I'm Ted.

06:37.248 --> 06:38.480
I know who you are.

06:38.830 --> 06:40.941
I have always heard so much about you.

06:41.109 --> 06:42.860
You're practically a legend in this place.

06:43.068 --> 06:44.903
I can't believe it's the first time we've met

06:45.071 --> 06:48.198
It's not. We've worked together on three projects before.

06:49.362 --> 06:53.078
I meant the first time we've met, outside of those three projects.

06:53.439 --> 06:55.539
It's not. What do you want, Ted?

06:56.746 --> 06:58.083
I want to take you to lunch.

06:59.505 --> 07:01.457
Screw that. Just fire me now.

07:01.582 --> 07:04.381
I won't make a scene.
No, it's not like that.

07:04.721 --> 07:07.009
30 years I give to this company,

07:07.177 --> 07:09.583
30 years, and this is how it ends.

07:10.027 --> 07:13.057
A: inside voices, and B: no one's firing you.

07:13.225 --> 07:16.435
I just wanna get to know you and you to know me.

07:16.603 --> 07:19.688
You can bring some friends, if you like, so they can, know me, too.

07:22.208 --> 07:23.848
How about Bill and Jeremy?

07:25.890 --> 07:28.726
Don't you have any friends who are, you know, older?

07:32.734 --> 07:33.699
Hey, guys.

07:34.087 --> 07:36.955
I just want you both to know that you're doing great work.

07:37.586 --> 07:41.122
Your specs on the robotic firefighting technology really...

07:41.682 --> 07:43.045
blew my mind.

07:44.998 --> 07:47.674
That's gotta feel good, right? Boost your morale?

07:49.571 --> 07:50.632
Thank you.

07:51.273 --> 07:52.295
Thank you...

07:54.090 --> 07:55.286
You're welcome.

07:55.922 --> 07:58.046
And, Phil, I like that outfit.

08:01.648 --> 08:03.019
That was incredible.

08:03.144 --> 08:05.859
I'm, like, tingly.
Our specs weren't that great.

08:06.981 --> 08:08.320
I reject her compliment.

08:09.606 --> 08:11.782
Then can I have your half?
It doesn't mean anything.

08:11.950 --> 08:14.536
She's only saying nice things because
the company ordered the executives

08:14.661 --> 08:15.816
to boost our morale.

08:15.941 --> 08:19.041
You shouldn't have any trouble giving up your half.

08:25.338 --> 08:27.214
I see the company made you a cat person,

08:27.552 --> 08:29.591
The company can go lick its ass.

08:31.025 --> 08:33.720
I'm sorry. I just don't see myself as a cat person.

08:34.145 --> 08:35.553
Neither did I,

08:35.678 --> 08:37.639
but I realized that we're cat people.

08:37.764 --> 08:39.450
That's insane.

08:39.575 --> 08:41.186
They're saying we're cats.

08:43.188 --> 08:44.774
I don't mean actual cats.

08:44.899 --> 08:46.939
They're saying we share the same qualities.

08:47.064 --> 08:50.921
Cats are quick, smart and independent, just like you, me, Debbie and Bruce.

08:53.753 --> 08:56.453
You think I'm quick, smart and independent?

08:56.828 --> 08:58.829
Everybody does. We've all talked about it.

08:59.025 --> 08:59.973
Really?

09:00.625 --> 09:02.888
I never thought of myself in cat terms.

09:03.013 --> 09:05.351
But I do like to think I have those attributes.

09:05.476 --> 09:07.629
Or should I say "cat-tributes"?

09:08.017 --> 09:09.798
Cat-tributes... can I use that?

09:10.144 --> 09:11.456
No, it's mine.

09:20.526 --> 09:21.977
What's wrong with this picture?

09:22.387 --> 09:26.190
Five steaks, one caesar salad, low-fat dressing on the side.

09:26.641 --> 09:27.939
I like a light lunch.

09:28.064 --> 09:30.137
It keeps me sharp for the rest of the day.

09:30.262 --> 09:32.680
Look at Mr. Perfect, Mr. Stays-awake-at-work.

09:34.491 --> 09:38.035
You're so put together. It's like
you stepped out of a magazine.

09:38.203 --> 09:40.813
Didn't you ever get a mustard stain on your shirt or...

09:40.938 --> 09:42.498
A hooker's vomit on your pants?

09:42.897 --> 09:46.254
I did do one of those things when I was 12, at a baseball game.

09:46.909 --> 09:50.298
I won't tell you which one it is,
but it was the game of my life.

09:51.966 --> 09:53.661
Look, fellas, I can have fun.

09:54.251 --> 09:56.011
What are you drinking, iced Tea?

09:56.179 --> 09:59.014
In our day, it was okay to knock back a few at lunch.

10:01.628 --> 10:04.937
I tell you what. I can go old-school. Drinks all around.

10:05.624 --> 10:08.076
And now, you can call me: "Mr. Has-a-drink-at-lunch

10:08.201 --> 10:11.443
But-let's-not-go-overboard It's-still-a-work-day."

10:11.612 --> 10:13.820
I know. It's long, but it makes some good points.

10:18.583 --> 10:21.806
Have you met Debbie, Bruce and
Rita? They're also cat people.

10:23.459 --> 10:25.016
Sure, I've seen some of you around,

10:25.141 --> 10:28.751
but we've never actually met.
Now we all have something in common.

10:30.171 --> 10:33.966
Being surrounded by pictures of cats
has made me realize how much I want one.

10:35.775 --> 10:37.885
I hate myself for being allergic.

10:40.228 --> 10:41.845
Have you guys seen that Youtube video

10:41.970 --> 10:44.351
that Janet sent around, with the cat that flushes the toilet?

10:45.111 --> 10:46.395
I didn't get that.

10:47.004 --> 10:49.524
It's really cute. He thinks he's people.

10:53.820 --> 10:56.023
It turned out it wasn't the school's mascot.

10:56.148 --> 10:58.365
It was just some random pig I'd stolen.

10:59.964 --> 11:01.494
This guy's hilarious.

11:01.619 --> 11:03.328
And what an operator.

11:03.496 --> 11:06.373
He comes back from lunch with the hostess' phone number.

11:06.906 --> 11:09.418
I am totally gonna make love to her.

11:13.910 --> 11:16.760
You would have loved it back in the old days, Teddy.

11:17.084 --> 11:19.844
There was no such thing as sexual harassment.

11:20.276 --> 11:23.553
There was nothing sweeter than telling some broad who wouldn't do ya

11:23.678 --> 11:27.102
to clean out her desk, put her crap in a box and go home.

11:28.479 --> 11:30.473
Gee, that sounds great.

11:31.606 --> 11:35.110
You be sure to tell everyone in your
age group how much fun you had.

11:35.778 --> 11:37.237
Tomorrow'll be even better.

11:37.742 --> 11:39.239
You are part of the group now.

11:39.568 --> 11:43.425
Tomorrow we're taking you to lunch.
Bring some dollar bills and a lap.

11:47.159 --> 11:51.000
I just made three new friends. Maybe
I was wrong about the cubicle themes.

11:51.125 --> 11:52.624
For the first time since I'm here,

11:52.749 --> 11:54.254
I feel like I'm part of something.

11:54.729 --> 11:55.695
Glad to hear it.

11:55.820 --> 11:58.759
I have to go to a strip club tomorrow with a bunch of old men.

12:00.219 --> 12:02.179
What theme did the company give you?

12:08.607 --> 12:10.700
Veronica and her hair were working hard

12:10.825 --> 12:12.836
on the company's campaign to improve morale.

12:12.961 --> 12:16.556
They both put on a good front, but
one of them was feeling frustrated

12:16.681 --> 12:18.446
and the other was feeling dry and flaky.

12:18.571 --> 12:20.121
You wanted to see me?

12:21.565 --> 12:25.619
We isolated rat R.N.A using T.R.I. Would you like to see it?

12:27.565 --> 12:28.315
Sure.

12:35.641 --> 12:39.439
That is very impressive. Nice work.
Wait. Let me turn it on.

12:43.941 --> 12:45.504
That is very impressive.

12:45.629 --> 12:49.601
Nice work, thanks for calling me down
here to see it. Nice work on that, too.

12:52.771 --> 12:55.201
I could listen to her praise me all day.

12:55.326 --> 12:56.682
It's not real.

12:56.807 --> 12:59.350
Any grad student can isolate rat R.N.A

12:59.760 --> 13:02.277
and I looked at our average specs from the other day.

13:02.402 --> 13:05.367
I rejected her compliment then, and I re-reject it now.

13:05.536 --> 13:07.838
Excuse me. Some of us aren't married to my wife.

13:07.963 --> 13:09.663
I've gotta grab all the compliments.

13:09.832 --> 13:11.872
I'm sorry, but when I hear an undeserved compliment,

13:11.997 --> 13:13.291
My ears want to throw up.

13:14.294 --> 13:16.627
Your ears are always throwing up about something.

13:18.779 --> 13:21.379
I can't believe you guys got me a kitten.

13:21.552 --> 13:24.719
Linda had finally found that sense
of community she'd been missing.

13:24.889 --> 13:28.432
Janet on the fourth floor also a cat person was giving them away.

13:28.805 --> 13:30.225
We thought you'd want one.

13:30.394 --> 13:33.185
And they thought right, didn't they, boots?

13:33.819 --> 13:34.679
Sandals?

13:34.804 --> 13:36.606
I should get away from footwear.

13:36.775 --> 13:39.820
Stapler. Now I'm just looking at things on my desk.

13:41.437 --> 13:42.667
That's good.

13:42.792 --> 13:45.737
It's great having a strong, young friend around.

13:46.155 --> 13:49.161
How do you know when your need
to be liked has become unhealthy?

13:49.671 --> 13:51.171
Do me. Do me next.

13:54.792 --> 13:56.074
Seriously, how do you know?

13:56.199 --> 13:58.295
Because clearly, I'm having trouble finding the line.

14:00.657 --> 14:02.090
Hello, space people.

14:03.635 --> 14:05.117
Is this space taken?

14:05.242 --> 14:06.803
Houston, we have a problem.

14:08.389 --> 14:09.514
I guess not.

14:10.759 --> 14:13.225
Janet upstairs is giving away the cutest kittens.

14:13.479 --> 14:14.895
Have you guys seen them?

14:15.064 --> 14:17.647
Houston, we have a problem.
What's that, joe?

14:17.816 --> 14:19.816
It's just, we were talking about space stuff.

14:20.553 --> 14:22.923
It might be over your head by 50 miles...

14:23.048 --> 14:24.571
That's where space starts.

14:24.740 --> 14:28.151
I know where space starts.
It's not like you're in a secret club.

14:28.872 --> 14:29.772
Shut up.

14:30.791 --> 14:32.605
Why are you sitting over here?

14:32.831 --> 14:35.081
All of us cat people have our own table.

14:35.548 --> 14:37.161
I thought I'd mix it up a little,

14:37.286 --> 14:40.045
see what the other groups are up to, check out the final frontier.

14:41.590 --> 14:44.925
I heard Pluto's not a planet anymore.
How do we feel about that, fellas?

14:49.890 --> 14:52.445
What?
I thought we were friends.

14:52.570 --> 14:54.768
You know, cats of a feather.

14:55.488 --> 14:58.938
We are friends, but I also want to be friends with other people.

14:59.107 --> 15:01.358
Did you just say "cats of a feather"?

15:02.398 --> 15:05.134
If you were sitting at our table,
you would have seen the shirts

15:05.259 --> 15:06.488
that bruce made for us.

15:07.619 --> 15:10.388
It's just one lunch. I can't believe you're making such a big deal.

15:10.577 --> 15:11.535
I'm not.

15:13.511 --> 15:15.145
But we gave you a cat.

15:15.990 --> 15:16.790
A cat.

15:17.993 --> 15:19.393
You're disgusting.

15:25.226 --> 15:26.883
I haven't seen you here before.

15:27.212 --> 15:30.470
Don't be silly. I'm down here all the time. What's that smell?

15:32.244 --> 15:34.057
It's my plate.
Yum!

15:34.226 --> 15:38.274
The food here's not very good.
I like to say even the salt needs salt.

15:39.534 --> 15:41.234
You're a very funny man.

15:42.040 --> 15:43.023
You think?

15:44.038 --> 15:46.018
In fact, I think you're "Phil-arious."

15:46.143 --> 15:50.198
My wife says I wouldn't know comedy if it ripped my face off.

15:50.730 --> 15:52.780
Good for you for having a wife.

16:06.090 --> 16:07.640
What happened, Linda?

16:07.765 --> 16:10.917
It looks like the cats abandoned you like you abandoned them.

16:11.042 --> 16:12.095
They abandoned you.

16:12.792 --> 16:14.113
I hope they didn't leave you

16:14.238 --> 16:16.115
any little gifts on the seat of your car.

16:17.101 --> 16:18.727
My car's in the shop.

16:20.342 --> 16:21.855
I didn't drive today.

16:26.652 --> 16:29.469
That's right. You better run. I'm gonna mess you up.

16:38.834 --> 16:41.374
Join us.
Guys, what's going on?

16:42.144 --> 16:43.744
I was hoping foreplay.

16:45.610 --> 16:47.923
All right, this party is over.

16:50.036 --> 16:51.509
Don't be that guy,

16:51.814 --> 16:53.970
that uptight guy we thought you were.

16:54.180 --> 16:55.972
You know what? I am that guy.

16:56.512 --> 16:58.552
The guy you want me to be gets taken advantage of,

16:58.677 --> 17:02.354
so I'm this guy, and this guy wants all of you out of my office.

17:05.756 --> 17:07.108
And why is that sticky?

17:20.242 --> 17:23.306
Where's the frakking aspirin? There it is.

17:23.746 --> 17:25.146
Good job, cabinet.

17:25.992 --> 17:27.342
God. I must stop.

17:27.767 --> 17:29.928
This will kill everything, right?

17:31.208 --> 17:33.153
That's why we weren't allowed to sell it.

17:34.888 --> 17:36.423
I'm losing my mind.

17:37.723 --> 17:39.895
I just saw Bob Gershon's butt.

17:40.506 --> 17:41.810
I think it touched my desk.

17:41.979 --> 17:44.418
I've been saying so many nice things to people

17:44.543 --> 17:47.276
I've started making words up. This morning, I called Phil

17:47.401 --> 17:48.816
"magniflorious."

17:48.985 --> 17:51.236
About Phil. He's falling in love with you.

17:52.060 --> 17:55.197
And if that doesn't sound "horrifliffic" I don't know what does.

17:55.370 --> 17:57.534
God. See, that's why I keep my hair up.

17:57.659 --> 18:00.205
It creates a distance, an unapproachability.

18:00.626 --> 18:01.579
I miss that me.

18:03.542 --> 18:05.370
I don't know who I am anymore.

18:06.151 --> 18:07.269
You know who you are?

18:07.394 --> 18:09.862
You are a great boss who gets things done.

18:09.987 --> 18:12.376
That should be all that matters.
Thank you.

18:12.965 --> 18:15.551
And you shouldn't be wiping wrinkly butt prints off your desk.

18:15.721 --> 18:18.603
I know. I shouldn't care what men over 50 think about me,

18:18.728 --> 18:20.557
except my father, and that ship has sailed.

18:20.726 --> 18:21.599
You're right.

18:22.144 --> 18:24.185
About my father? Did he say something to you?

18:24.354 --> 18:25.646
I'm talking about here.

18:25.771 --> 18:27.480
You can't win with some of them anyway.

18:28.164 --> 18:30.504
I found cat feces in my car.

18:34.614 --> 18:36.364
Speaking of cat-related vandalism...

18:43.497 --> 18:44.581
What are you doing?

18:47.174 --> 18:49.210
Clearly, I'm losing my mind.

18:49.673 --> 18:51.779
I thought decorating the cubicles would create

18:51.904 --> 18:53.720
this great sense of community.

18:53.845 --> 18:56.843
But you can't base a community on made-up personalities.

18:57.012 --> 18:58.595
That's like high school,

18:58.764 --> 19:01.765
only no one's on drugs and everyone's trying to get pregnant.

19:02.116 --> 19:04.267
The druggie teen slut is right.

19:05.811 --> 19:07.187
I said you were right.

19:08.898 --> 19:10.732
It's time to end this madness.
Agreed.

19:10.901 --> 19:11.900
Drones...

19:13.903 --> 19:15.703
Can I have your attention?

19:16.280 --> 19:19.376
Something tells me I should have known you in high school.

19:19.501 --> 19:22.707
I actually went to an all-girls school and was totally straight.

19:22.832 --> 19:24.566
But I'm very trampy now.

19:24.974 --> 19:27.164
Recently, we've tried doing things a little...

19:29.514 --> 19:32.653
I have never seen you this excited about schematics before.

19:32.778 --> 19:35.452
Now that I've redone them, I think they're some of my best work.

19:35.577 --> 19:38.204
I finally have something worthy of Veronica's praise.

19:38.329 --> 19:41.392
And since, unlike you, I've earned this moment,

19:41.622 --> 19:43.322
I'm going to enjoy it.

19:45.268 --> 19:47.554
And while it may have been a worthy experiment,

19:47.679 --> 19:49.063
it is now over.

19:49.681 --> 19:53.107
And so from now on, there will be no more praise.

19:53.564 --> 19:56.449
And I will no longer be complimenting any of you...

19:57.419 --> 19:58.319
Damn it!

20:00.912 --> 20:03.660
Unless it is truly your best work.

20:05.905 --> 20:06.805
Damn it!

20:07.081 --> 20:10.457
And the next time some survey asks how happy you are,

20:10.848 --> 20:12.198
you check "very,"

20:12.323 --> 20:14.921
or I'll give you something to be happy about.

20:16.870 --> 20:20.593
I'm not sure that makes any...
The hair is up. That's all they hear.

20:24.353 --> 20:26.481
And so things got back to normal.

20:29.484 --> 20:31.062
I think we need to talk.

20:31.231 --> 20:34.858
Sweet.
Look, you are a very nice man...

20:35.027 --> 20:37.277
I like hearing that.

20:37.714 --> 20:41.197
That is, I like you as afriend.

20:41.366 --> 20:42.895
Step one... check.

20:43.701 --> 20:45.910
Nothing is ever gonna happen with us.

20:47.100 --> 20:47.900
I see.

20:49.535 --> 20:51.819
And now I must get out of the room as quickly as possible.

20:52.702 --> 20:53.452
Wait.

20:55.069 --> 20:57.060
Another time, another place,

20:57.185 --> 21:00.385
two other people... it could've been magniflorious.

21:01.594 --> 21:02.719
You mean that?

21:03.160 --> 21:03.910
I do,

21:04.785 --> 21:06.806
especially the part about two other people.

21:12.365 --> 21:14.874
And things got back to normal for Linda, too,

21:15.255 --> 21:18.818
although she did get that sense of community she was looking for.

21:19.231 --> 21:21.296
Unfortunately, it was centered around blaming her

21:21.421 --> 21:23.488
for getting things back to normal.

21:24.325 --> 21:25.525
And as for me,

21:25.650 --> 21:28.839
I kinda like the idea of not caring what people think of me.

21:29.270 --> 21:31.339
Go to hell, Ted. Will do.
