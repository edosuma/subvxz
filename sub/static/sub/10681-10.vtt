off, they looked up at you,

to put 'em back on.

- Right.

08:30.367 --> 08:32.402
You buy it for the $550.

08:32.403 --> 08:36.004
If it doesn't sell inside of
six months, you gotta buy it.

08:36.006 --> 08:37.173
I believe in you, Ming.

08:37.174 --> 08:39.042
It'll test your salesmanship

08:39.043 --> 08:42.245
as well as your instincts
about the product.

08:44.148 --> 08:46.149
I think we definitely sell
this within six months.

08:46.150 --> 08:47.750
Deal. $550.

08:47.751 --> 08:50.552
All right.

08:50.554 --> 08:52.020
- Thank you.
- Bye, guys.

08:52.023 --> 08:53.722
- All right.
- It's badass, man.

08:53.725 --> 08:56.893
This is Inigo Montoya's
sword. Prepare to die.

08:56.894 --> 08:58.360
I die every day inside

08:58.363 --> 09:00.395
when I come to work and I see your face.

09:00.398 --> 09:02.365
[laughter]

09:02.366 --> 09:04.067
You ever been run through before?

09:04.068 --> 09:06.769
'Cause it's 'bout to happen right now.

09:06.770 --> 09:11.006
Kids, we are privileged
to have comic book royalty

09:11.009 --> 09:12.841
at the table with us here today.

09:12.844 --> 09:14.844
The legend, the one and only Jim Lee.

09:14.846 --> 09:16.044
- Welcome, sir.
- Hey, well, thank you.

09:16.047 --> 09:17.679
Thank you very much, man.

09:17.682 --> 09:19.749
Figured these guys would
love to ask some questions.

09:19.750 --> 09:21.250
Fire away.

09:21.253 --> 09:22.885
Is there one character
that you can say that,

09:22.888 --> 09:24.754
like, you never get tired of drawing,

09:24.755 --> 09:27.456
like, you still get excited
every time you have to draw 'em?

09:27.458 --> 09:28.924
They're very few.

09:28.927 --> 09:30.559
You know, each character
represents kind of a note

09:30.562 --> 09:32.294
and if you play that
note or you're playing

09:32.297 --> 09:35.197
that same song over and over
again, you get a little tired.

09:35.200 --> 09:38.301
That said, I think that's why
Robin works so great with Batman

09:38.302 --> 09:41.270
because Batman is so
dark and full of angst,

09:41.273 --> 09:43.472
then you put this really light,
bouncy character next to him

09:43.475 --> 09:45.475
and you get that real
nice juxtapositioning

09:45.476 --> 09:47.043
of light and dark.

09:47.044 --> 09:48.745
You know, a lot of people
kinda dismiss Robin,

09:48.746 --> 09:51.313
but he plays a real critical
part in kinda humanizing

09:51.316 --> 09:53.415
and making Batman more accessible.

09:53.418 --> 09:54.951
Nice. What about you, Zap?

09:54.952 --> 09:56.552
You got a question
for the great Jim Lee?

09:56.554 --> 09:58.254
Sure do.

09:58.255 --> 10:00.590
What was the most daunting
project that you ever undertook?

10:00.591 --> 10:02.424
Probably, uh, "All
Star Batman and Robin,"

10:02.427 --> 10:04.059
uh, working with Frank Miller.

10:04.062 --> 10:05.995
He was the guy that really
inspired me to get into comics,

10:05.996 --> 10:08.063
and then years later,
I'm working with the guy.

10:08.066 --> 10:09.599
And, uh, thing with Frank is,

10:09.600 --> 10:12.067
he's obv... obviously
a master storyteller,

10:12.070 --> 10:13.403
so as soon as I read the script,

10:13.404 --> 10:15.104
I would imagine what he would draw,

10:15.105 --> 10:17.506
so it was kinda daunting, but
after I kinda got past that

10:17.509 --> 10:19.475
and said, "This is Batman,
you should have fun with it,"

10:19.476 --> 10:20.842
it was smooth sailing after that,

10:20.845 --> 10:22.745
but working with, you know, your idol

10:22.746 --> 10:25.248
is one of the really
cool things about comics.

10:25.250 --> 10:26.916
Bry, you got a question for Jim?

10:26.918 --> 10:29.118
- I do. My middle name is Lee.
- Okay.

10:29.120 --> 10:31.086
I find myself to not be very successful.

10:31.088 --> 10:32.654
- You have Jim Lee, Jason Lee...
- Right.

10:32.657 --> 10:34.456
Bruce Lee, Sara Lee.

10:34.459 --> 10:37.025
Should I change my name to
Bryan Lee and drop the Johnson?

10:37.028 --> 10:39.195
Oh, sure, uh, yeah. Why not, man?

10:39.197 --> 10:41.129
Sorry, Dad, killin' the family name.

10:41.131 --> 10:43.499
Bryan Lee from now on. [laughter]

10:43.500 --> 10:45.033
Got some stuff outside

10:45.036 --> 10:47.003
from one of the best
'80s movies of all time.

10:47.004 --> 10:49.338
- Oh, wow!
- You weren't kiddin'. My God!

10:49.341 --> 10:52.542
There's a lot of pressure when you're
sittin' there and you're there too!

10:52.543 --> 10:55.484
Uh, I had to want it
more than anyone else!

10:57.556 --> 11:01.393
When you're workin' on
something like "Hush,"

11:01.394 --> 11:04.327
which goes on to become as seminal

11:04.330 --> 11:07.096
as "Dark Knight Returns,"
is there any inkling like,

11:07.099 --> 11:09.066
"This is gonna live forever,"
or are you just like,

11:09.067 --> 11:11.000
"I gotta get this page done"?

11:11.003 --> 11:13.037
You never know as you're doing
it how it's gonna be received

11:13.038 --> 11:15.205
and then whether it's
gonna sort of stand the, uh,

11:15.206 --> 11:17.674
test of time over the years.
One of the great things about

11:17.677 --> 11:20.344
having worked in comics
for so long is seeing fans

11:20.346 --> 11:22.178
that are 15 years old, 30 years old,

11:22.181 --> 11:23.681
- 45 years old...
- Right.

11:23.682 --> 11:25.282
- And you can time
- stamp when they got into comics

11:25.283 --> 11:28.751
based on the stuff that they
saw of your work at that time.

11:28.754 --> 11:31.120
I've seen a lot of comments
on Twitter like, "Oh, yeah.

11:31.123 --> 11:34.591
This character really kinda
changed my life," and, um,

11:34.592 --> 11:36.427
you know, "It awakened
my sexuality," whatever...

11:36.428 --> 11:38.696
You know, what have you, right?

11:38.697 --> 11:40.864
So there's somebody
that comes up to you,

11:40.865 --> 11:42.432
and they're like, "Sila!"

11:42.434 --> 11:44.368
Yeah, exactly right. Yeah.

11:44.370 --> 11:46.636
It's like, yeah, we've all
been there at some point.

11:50.580 --> 11:53.280
<i>[rock music]</i>

11:54.456 --> 11:57.456
[motorcycle engine growls]

11:58.001 --> 12:00.336
- Hey, how you doin'?
- How you doin' today, guys?

12:00.337 --> 12:02.971
- Hey, how are ya?
- Guys into '80s movies at all?

12:02.974 --> 12:05.006
- [scoffs]
- Amazing '80s movies.

12:05.009 --> 12:07.043
Is there any other kind of '80s movie?

12:07.044 --> 12:08.211
We love '80s movies.

12:08.211 --> 12:11.125
I got some stuff outside from one
of the best '80s movies of all time.

12:11.404 --> 12:13.004
And you can't fit it through the door?

12:13.005 --> 12:15.072
Uh, I can't. They're actually pretty big

12:15.075 --> 12:16.441
and there's a few of 'em,
but you're gonna love 'em.

12:16.442 --> 12:18.143
- All right, let's check it out.
- Okay.

12:18.144 --> 12:21.145
- Lead the way.
- Sure.

12:21.148 --> 12:23.280
Every so often, somebody comes in

12:23.283 --> 12:26.784
and asks us to go outside with
the promise of seeing something

12:26.787 --> 12:28.320
so cool that, you know,

12:28.322 --> 12:29.921
it'll be an opportunity of a lifetime.

12:29.923 --> 12:31.990
One of two things usually
happens after that.

12:31.991 --> 12:34.158
Somebody shows you a dick pic,

12:34.161 --> 12:36.461
or somebody hits you
in the back of the head

12:36.462 --> 12:38.263
and takes your money.

12:38.264 --> 12:39.697
That's why I don't follow
Ming out when he asks me.

12:39.700 --> 12:41.932
But, um... [laughter]

12:41.934 --> 12:43.969
[laughs]

12:43.971 --> 12:45.870
- That's awesome.
- Wow.

12:45.873 --> 12:48.139
- You weren't kiddin'.
- Oh, my God.

12:48.142 --> 12:50.142
Gentlemen, these are my Gremlins.

12:50.144 --> 12:51.809
- Awesome.
- They're in the sunlight,

12:51.812 --> 12:54.513
even though they're not
supposed to be, but... yeah.

12:54.514 --> 13:00.885
<i>♪ ♪</i>

13:00.888 --> 13:02.320
Where'd you get 'em?

13:02.322 --> 13:03.889
When I was a kid in,
like, the early '90s,

13:03.890 --> 13:05.724
I used to go to the old
Warner Brothers Studio Store.

13:05.725 --> 13:07.292
- Mm-hmm.
- These guys were hanging

13:07.293 --> 13:09.360
from the rafters, like, as
part of, like, decoration.

13:09.363 --> 13:10.961
And I would always ask
if I could buy them,

13:10.964 --> 13:11.996
and they said they weren't for sale,

13:11.999 --> 13:13.398
they were part of the store.

13:13.399 --> 13:15.033
That store went out of
business a long time ago.

13:15.034 --> 13:17.668
- I-I finally picked them up.
- Very cool.

13:17.671 --> 13:19.070
It's pretty elaborate
for a display item,

13:19.072 --> 13:20.238
you know, not for sale.

13:20.240 --> 13:21.639
Yeah, maybe that's why Warner Brothers

13:21.642 --> 13:23.073
- went out of business, man.
- Exactly.

13:23.076 --> 13:24.475
Put too much money into the props

13:24.477 --> 13:26.010
that were on... Hangin' on the wall.

13:26.013 --> 13:27.879
[laughter]

13:27.880 --> 13:30.414
I saw "Gremlins" when I
was, like, in high school.

13:30.417 --> 13:32.384
How old were you when
"Gremlins" came out?

13:32.385 --> 13:34.385
I was ten. So, I mean, it fascinated me.

13:34.388 --> 13:37.389
I saw it more of as a,
like, a cautionary tale.

13:37.390 --> 13:40.158
Maybe American responsibility,
because, if you remember,

13:40.159 --> 13:43.161
the guy who had the gremlin
was a little Asian dude.

13:43.163 --> 13:44.729
- Yeah.
- Like it... yeah, no.

13:44.730 --> 13:46.163
You know, the white man
tried to come in and buy it,

13:46.165 --> 13:47.599
and he wouldn't let him buy it.

13:47.600 --> 13:49.533
You know, and what happened?

13:49.536 --> 13:52.070
You literally took one of
the best movies of childhood

13:52.072 --> 13:55.005
and turned it into a metaphor
for American interventionism.

13:55.008 --> 13:56.508
Like, why, man?

13:56.509 --> 13:58.043
Hey, that's just what I saw. Hey.

13:58.044 --> 13:59.577
At ten?

13:59.580 --> 14:02.013
[laughter]

14:02.014 --> 14:03.514
I think that if we got these,

14:03.517 --> 14:04.950
I think we could move 'em at the Stash.

14:04.951 --> 14:06.418
I mean, it may take a
while, but, you know,

14:06.419 --> 14:07.952
Christmas rolls around,

14:07.955 --> 14:09.955
decorate the store, set
up the Christmas tree,

14:09.956 --> 14:11.389
- put 'em around the bottom.
- Oh, yeah.

14:11.390 --> 14:12.524
Put a little Santa hat on this one.

14:12.525 --> 14:14.024
[laughter]

14:14.027 --> 14:15.726
What are you looking to get for 'em?

14:15.729 --> 14:20.764
For the group, all three,
I'd like to get $5,000.

14:20.767 --> 14:22.967
$5,000, huh?

14:22.970 --> 14:25.202
- Whew!
- Which is a good price.

14:25.205 --> 14:26.403
- For you.
- For you, yeah.

14:26.405 --> 14:27.706
For me.

14:27.707 --> 14:29.774
Any chance you'd take $2,500?

14:29.775 --> 14:31.076
I don't think I could go as low

14:31.077 --> 14:32.878
as 2,500 bucks for the three.

14:32.879 --> 14:36.548
But I could take off
500 bucks and do $4,500.

14:36.549 --> 14:38.216
What about $3,000?

14:38.217 --> 14:40.317
I could split them up
if you wanted to maybe do

14:40.320 --> 14:42.586
- one of them or two of them.
- You can't break 'em up.

14:42.588 --> 14:44.121
That'd be like breaking
up, you know, like, a...

14:44.124 --> 14:45.990
A litter of puppies at the pet store.

14:45.993 --> 14:48.460
- [laughs]
- You just don't do that.

14:48.461 --> 14:52.129
I think my highest offer I
could go today would be $3,500.

14:52.131 --> 14:53.798
I-I couldn't go higher
than that though.

14:53.799 --> 14:55.966
$4,000 for all three.

14:55.969 --> 14:59.169
Yeah... I can't do it.

14:59.172 --> 15:01.105
I-I think $3,500 is...
Is where I'm gonna

15:01.107 --> 15:03.841
- have to draw the line today.
- All right, I understand.

15:03.844 --> 15:05.342
I appreciate you takin'
a look at 'em though.

15:05.345 --> 15:06.778
Thanks for bringin' 'em in though.

15:06.779 --> 15:09.280
- No problem. Not a problem.
- Yeah, thanks.

15:09.283 --> 15:13.585
You told me a phenomenal
story about putting yourself

15:13.586 --> 15:15.986
in the headspace to be
successful, 'cause you weren't

15:15.989 --> 15:17.621
- always in the industry.
- Sure.

15:17.624 --> 15:19.256
One... at one point, you, like fans,

15:19.259 --> 15:21.025
were outside the industry,
wantin' to get in.

15:21.028 --> 15:22.693
Yeah, you know, it's weird,
'cause I've only shared

15:22.696 --> 15:24.461
that story with you
just 'cause I thought

15:24.463 --> 15:26.664
it was such a weird
story and it was always

15:26.667 --> 15:28.299
- everything that you remember.
- It's fantastic.

15:28.302 --> 15:30.701
Okay, so I very much
wanted to get into comics,

15:30.703 --> 15:32.370
and my two favorite comic book writers

15:32.371 --> 15:34.605
were, uh, John Byrne and Frank Miller.

15:34.607 --> 15:38.043
And for some reason, I was into
this whole, like, Rocky thing

15:38.044 --> 15:40.110
where I had... it was
like mind-body, right?

15:40.113 --> 15:41.645
It wasn't just that the
art had to be good enough,

15:41.648 --> 15:44.716
I had to physically want
it more than anyone else,

15:44.717 --> 15:47.351
and so, uh, there was this
little track at this high school

15:47.354 --> 15:49.321
and I would run, like, a couple miles,

15:49.322 --> 15:51.990
but while I was running
I would be chanting,

15:51.991 --> 15:54.125
"Miller, Byrne, Miller, Byrne,"

15:54.126 --> 15:56.494
as if, like, every step I was taking

15:56.495 --> 15:58.129
was physically getting me closer

15:58.130 --> 16:00.731
towards this goal of
becoming John and Frank.

16:00.734 --> 16:03.234
So I-I-I don't know if it
helped or not, honestly.

16:03.235 --> 16:04.568
- It... it clearly helped!
- But it did get me in shape.

16:04.571 --> 16:06.171
- It got me in shape.
- Of course.

16:06.173 --> 16:09.039
To me, it was just about
I had to want it so much

16:09.042 --> 16:11.909
that it... I could work through
the pain of anything, right?

16:11.912 --> 16:14.245
I could run ten miles, I
could move to New York City,

16:14.246 --> 16:15.913
and then work as a janitor at Marvel

16:15.916 --> 16:17.581
if that would get me
into the, uh, office,

16:17.583 --> 16:19.717
so I just was super focused on it,

16:19.720 --> 16:22.988
and I think about six months
later, I-I-I got my first gig.

16:22.990 --> 16:24.822
- Isn't that tremendous, man?
- Yeah.

16:24.825 --> 16:26.758
And now think about
it. There's some kids

16:26.759 --> 16:28.225
runnin' around tracks somewhere going,

16:28.227 --> 16:30.028
"Jim Lee, Jim Lee, Jim Lee."

16:30.029 --> 16:31.863
[laughter]

16:31.865 --> 16:33.731
Oh, my God, dude!

16:33.734 --> 16:35.033
- I had this!
- I had this too.

16:41.432 --> 16:43.399
- Hey, how you doin'?
- What's goin' on, guys?

16:43.400 --> 16:44.900
- How you doin'?
- Are you guys into football?

16:44.903 --> 16:48.004
[scoffs] Oh, my God, dude!

16:48.005 --> 16:49.772
- I had this!
- I had this too.

16:49.774 --> 16:51.307
- I absolutely...
- Even I had this.

16:51.308 --> 16:53.942
Oh, how awesome was this game?

16:53.945 --> 16:55.644
Oh, my God.

16:55.647 --> 16:58.147
Electric football. I
haven't seen it in decades.

16:58.149 --> 17:03.753
<i>♪ ♪</i>

17:03.754 --> 17:07.690
Look how massive it is,
man. It just screams power.

17:07.692 --> 17:10.125
Grandeur. NFL.

17:10.127 --> 17:11.693
Remember that kid in
that "Christmas Story"

17:11.694 --> 17:13.127
- when he got the rifle?
- Yes.

17:13.131 --> 17:14.864
- This was my Red Ryder.
- I know exactly.

17:14.865 --> 17:17.598
This was what I was beggin'
my parents for that Christmas.

17:17.602 --> 17:19.268
I wanted it probably more than you did.

17:19.269 --> 17:20.603
- [scoffs] No way.
- No, I...

17:20.605 --> 17:21.871
Okay, listen. Okay.

17:21.873 --> 17:23.472
Leading up to Christmas that year,

17:23.473 --> 17:26.275
did you plan NFL games nightly

17:26.277 --> 17:29.112
and start to compile a statistics book?

17:29.114 --> 17:30.680
I had it all mapped out.

17:30.682 --> 17:32.015
- I was gonna do it all.
- Okay.

17:32.017 --> 17:33.816
I was gonna... I was
gonna be the Commish.

17:33.817 --> 17:35.384
[laughter]

17:35.386 --> 17:37.653
I had such dreams, I mean...

17:37.654 --> 17:40.823
The National Flanagan
League. You play here.

17:40.825 --> 17:43.526
It... it vibrated, and you
laid out all your players

17:43.528 --> 17:45.060
on a... on a metal field.

17:45.063 --> 17:47.797
You plugged it in and then
you watched the action.

17:47.798 --> 17:49.999
You... you had... there
was, like, little wheels

17:50.000 --> 17:51.299
on the bottom of the players,

17:51.301 --> 17:53.502
and if you turned the
wheels a certain way,

17:53.505 --> 17:55.337
those players, when
the vibration starts...

17:55.339 --> 17:57.006
They vibrate right off the table.

17:57.008 --> 17:58.673
[laughter]

17:58.675 --> 18:00.343
It looks pretty good, man.

18:00.345 --> 18:02.678
It's got all 11 players on each team.

18:02.680 --> 18:05.080
And most importantly,
'cause everybody loses it,

18:05.083 --> 18:06.415
the football.

18:06.417 --> 18:08.017
This is everything.

18:08.019 --> 18:09.852
That's the key to
thousands of hours of fun.

18:09.854 --> 18:11.421
Well, for him, apparently.

18:11.423 --> 18:13.388
All right, well, the last
thing, hit the switch.

18:13.391 --> 18:14.557
Power on.

18:14.558 --> 18:15.724
[game whirring]

18:15.727 --> 18:17.026
[laughter]

18:17.028 --> 18:19.494
- My God!
- Spinning in a circle.

18:19.497 --> 18:21.329
They're just runnin' around randomly.

18:21.332 --> 18:22.932
Maybe it's 'cause they're
not going fast enough.

18:22.933 --> 18:24.567
- Yeah, there... oh, there we go!
- [game buzzes]

18:24.568 --> 18:27.236
- There we go!
- That's the noise I remember.

18:27.238 --> 18:30.006
This... this is probably
the worst game ever invented.

18:30.008 --> 18:31.673
Hey, I don't know
where you got such high,

18:31.675 --> 18:33.442
lofty expectations for this game.

18:33.444 --> 18:35.711
Did you believe everything
they said on the box?

18:35.712 --> 18:38.013
Like, "Real NFL Action!"

18:38.016 --> 18:39.848
"Players will turn left and right!"

18:39.851 --> 18:41.550
I just don't think you have the patience

18:41.552 --> 18:43.251
or the mind-set to play it properly.

18:43.253 --> 18:45.188
That... that's what I-I
feel happened here...

18:45.190 --> 18:47.089
- I...
- Because we know for a fact

18:47.092 --> 18:49.057
that people still play the game

18:49.059 --> 18:51.727
and there are leagues devoted
to this game to this day.

18:51.729 --> 18:53.395
- No.
- Yes.

18:53.397 --> 18:55.064
There's a world championship
of electronic football.

18:55.066 --> 18:56.265
I think "electronic"

18:56.267 --> 18:57.900
- is taking it a little far.
- Yeah!

18:57.902 --> 18:59.102
- Let's call it what it is!
- Keep that "electric."

18:59.104 --> 19:00.970
"Vibrating metal kinda football."

19:00.971 --> 19:03.372
Your mom will love it!
Tell her to sit on it.

19:03.374 --> 19:07.242
[laughter]

19:07.244 --> 19:10.613
I think it would be hours
of joy at the Stash for us.

19:10.615 --> 19:12.248
You're seriously gonna buy this?

19:12.250 --> 19:14.584
Yes, I want it. For... for me.

19:14.586 --> 19:15.984
So what are you lookin' to get for it?

19:15.987 --> 19:19.288
- $250.
- $250 though, um...

19:19.289 --> 19:21.656
It's a time machine, man. You
know, brings you right back.

19:21.659 --> 19:23.326
How 'bout $100?

19:23.327 --> 19:24.759
Oh, I can't do $100.

19:24.761 --> 19:26.461
- I can't do $100.
- Come on.

19:26.463 --> 19:27.997
$200.

19:27.999 --> 19:30.266
How 'bout...$125?

19:30.268 --> 19:32.602
You do $150, I'm happy.

19:32.604 --> 19:35.605
All right, you got it.

19:35.606 --> 19:37.573
- All right.
- Cool.

19:37.575 --> 19:38.773
- Appreciate it.
- Enjoy.

19:40.911 --> 19:44.413
I have a ton of, uh, Jim
Lee artwork in my life.

19:44.414 --> 19:46.682
There are two original
pieces that I cherish.

19:46.683 --> 19:49.352
One, it was a piece that
you drew of Harley Quinn

19:49.354 --> 19:52.521
holding Batman and Joker as marionettes.

19:52.523 --> 19:54.123
It's stunning to look at.

19:54.125 --> 19:55.958
- The other piece is in the Stash.
- Sure.

19:55.960 --> 19:58.161
It's a door that features Superman,

19:58.163 --> 19:59.662
- Batman...
- Right.

19:59.663 --> 20:01.263
- And then Jay and Silent Bob.
- Sure, yeah.

20:01.266 --> 20:02.765
<i>We framed it and put it on display...</i>

20:02.767 --> 20:04.200
<i>- Right.
- In the Stash here,</i>

20:04.201 --> 20:05.673
<i>like, in a big frame behind glass.</i>

20:05.896 --> 20:08.003
Dude, I was sweatin' bullets
when I was doing that piece

20:08.006 --> 20:09.872
'cause I'm... I'm not
really great with likenesses

20:09.874 --> 20:11.473
in that I don't spend
a lot of time on it,

20:11.476 --> 20:13.709
and that's kind of a
separate skill altogether.

20:13.711 --> 20:15.611
So there's a lot of pressure
when you're sittin' there,

20:15.613 --> 20:17.613
- and you're there too...
- Yes. Just how it's like...

20:17.615 --> 20:19.182
Uh, just, like, watching
all this go down,

20:19.183 --> 20:21.017
and I'm... I'm working
vertically with a Sharpie.

20:21.019 --> 20:24.353
So there's a lot of things that are
going on as you're doing the piece.

20:24.355 --> 20:27.155
I don't know how long it took,
but it felt like five minutes.

20:27.157 --> 20:29.125
I mean, again, you
escape into that world.

20:29.126 --> 20:32.662
It was so fast that, like, by
the time he was done drawing,

20:32.663 --> 20:34.829
I noticed that I was... I was turgid.

20:34.832 --> 20:36.265
- I was just like...
- Okay, all right.

20:36.267 --> 20:38.021
That was you behind me.
All right, yeah, yeah!

20:38.022 --> 20:39.305
[laughter] All right, so, uh...

20:39.306 --> 20:40.368
Is that a Sharpie in your pocket?

20:40.371 --> 20:42.070
- Yeah, yeah.
- No.

20:42.073 --> 20:44.240
Oh, man, that's all the
time we got for this week.

20:44.241 --> 20:45.641
We gotta go.

20:45.643 --> 20:46.875
For "Comic Book Men," I'm Kevin Smith.

20:46.877 --> 20:48.544
- Bryan Johnson.
- Walt Flanagan.

20:48.546 --> 20:50.378
- Mike Zapcic.
- Ming Chen.

20:50.381 --> 20:53.382
Ladies and gentlemen, give it
up for the tremendous Jim Lee.

20:53.384 --> 20:55.585
Wow. Thank you, thank you, guys.

20:55.586 --> 20:58.854
The world is full of Jokers,
kids, so always be Batman.

20:58.855 --> 21:00.256
Good night.
