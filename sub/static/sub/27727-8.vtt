00:53.800 --> 00:57.080
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

00:57.120 --> 00:59.680
JEREMY: Thank you.
JAMES: Thank you.

00:59.720 --> 01:02.160
Thank you.

01:02.200 --> 01:03.960
Thank you very much,
everyone.

01:04.000 --> 01:08.760
Now, welcome to what is
a Grand Tour special,

01:08.800 --> 01:12.120
in which we go on vacation.

01:12.160 --> 01:13.640
Yep. Let me explain.

01:13.680 --> 01:15.400
The other day
we were wondering

01:15.440 --> 01:19.280
why some people who
want to visit the western
bit of America,

01:19.280 --> 01:23.280
choose to do so on
an RV touring holiday.

01:23.280 --> 01:25.920
It is very popular.
I mean, we all have friends
who have done it.

01:25.920 --> 01:27.960
And they say
they had a good time.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.760
Sounds like caravanning
to us, though.

01:29.800 --> 01:32.200
-And you couldn't
enjoy that...
-(LAUGHTER)

01:32.240 --> 01:33.960
...unless you were mental.
However,

01:34.000 --> 01:37.320
Mr Wilman says that since
this is a motoring,

01:37.360 --> 01:39.160
and travel
and adventure show

01:39.200 --> 01:41.280
he would rent us an RV.

01:41.320 --> 01:43.600
And then we could
go over there

01:43.640 --> 01:47.160
to see if we could find
out what the appeal is.

01:53.840 --> 01:56.520
JAMES: This was
the location he chose.

01:59.800 --> 02:05.160
And this was the
Winnebago Chieftain
that he rented for us.

02:05.200 --> 02:08.240
And it was
very terrible in every way.

02:10.440 --> 02:12.160
Chaps,
if you'd like to brace,

02:12.200 --> 02:15.160
I'm gonna put my foot down,
see what she'll do. Happy?

02:15.240 --> 02:17.160
BOTH: Yeah.
-Here we go.

02:18.240 --> 02:20.160
(ENGINE REVS)

02:21.240 --> 02:22.320
40.

02:25.240 --> 02:26.880
43.

02:28.000 --> 02:31.160
That's flat-out.

02:31.240 --> 02:35.000
JEREMY: This slowness put
Hammond and me in a bad mood.

02:35.040 --> 02:37.440
You're just helping yourself
to cards. I...

02:37.520 --> 02:39.960
I thought that was the idea.
Gotta find all the cards...

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
I have to have
a turn as well.

02:42.040 --> 02:43.880
Well, that'll take ages.

02:43.880 --> 02:45.760
Don't make my holiday worse
than it already is.

02:45.800 --> 02:48.080
-(RATTLING)
-It is pretty bad in here,
isn't it?

02:48.120 --> 02:50.400
It's worse
than I thought it would be.

02:50.440 --> 02:54.080
Who decided, "Yes,
that wallpaper makes
it look like home"?

02:54.120 --> 02:57.600
This material existed...

02:57.640 --> 03:00.520
...in the late-1960s
in South Yorkshire.

03:00.560 --> 03:03.080
It's called pleblon
that we're sitting on.

03:03.120 --> 03:05.440
And this - this is vulgalure.

03:05.480 --> 03:08.520
RV design,
as far as I can tell,

03:08.560 --> 03:11.080
stopped in 1972.

03:11.120 --> 03:12.440
RICHARD: Yes.

03:12.480 --> 03:14.040
It's a different
design language

03:14.080 --> 03:16.080
and the language is: Shit.

03:16.120 --> 03:19.320
But all of this
doesn't trouble me

03:19.360 --> 03:22.360
half as much as that.

03:22.400 --> 03:24.680
We're here for a week.

03:24.720 --> 03:28.360
At no point will
we be more than 12 feet

03:28.400 --> 03:30.240
from where
the turds are stored.

03:31.320 --> 03:32.320
His turds.

03:33.960 --> 03:35.280
Look at this.

03:36.360 --> 03:38.040
That's the lavatory door.

03:38.080 --> 03:40.840
Look at it.
This is unacceptable.

03:40.880 --> 03:43.080
What separates
us from the animals

03:43.120 --> 03:46.640
is reason
and defecating in private.

03:46.680 --> 03:50.960
You go somewhere comfortable,
read a newspaper,
do your business.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.760
You can't do that in there.

03:52.800 --> 03:55.120
-(RATTLING)
-What is
that shocking racket?

03:55.160 --> 03:58.160
-Everything.
-Everything rattles
because it's full of crap.

03:58.200 --> 04:00.120
(JEREMY GROANS)

04:00.160 --> 04:02.840
I'm not... I can't...
I can't do a week in here.

04:02.880 --> 04:05.600
(RATTLING)

04:05.640 --> 04:08.480
JEREMY: After just five miles
we'd had enough.

04:08.520 --> 04:12.080
And pulled over
for a cup of American coffee.

04:12.120 --> 04:16.200
Right. Recipe's very simple.
Take a coffee bean
and razor blade.

04:16.240 --> 04:18.960
Chop just the end off.
Lovely.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.720
Let's check the...

04:20.760 --> 04:22.240
Lukewarm? Yeah.

04:22.320 --> 04:25.040
Pop it in.

04:25.080 --> 04:26.600
(STIRS) Mix it up
till the water is

04:26.640 --> 04:29.680
just slightly coloured.

04:29.720 --> 04:31.600
-Perfect.
-So in conclusion, then,

04:31.640 --> 04:34.520
there is no appeal
to an RV holiday, is there?

04:34.560 --> 04:38.440
This whole experience
wouldn't be so bad

04:38.480 --> 04:41.600
if we somehow
could modify it,
so it's better to live in.

04:41.640 --> 04:43.800
Well, only if
we could have one each.

04:43.800 --> 04:45.560
Well, why don't we do that?

04:45.600 --> 04:48.520
JAMES: Get one each?
-Yeah, why don't we
just get one each?

04:48.560 --> 04:51.560
And then modify it to suit
our particular requirements.

04:51.600 --> 04:55.680
-We don't have to have
all of this offensive--
-We can do what we want.

04:55.720 --> 04:58.520
JAMES: We therefore
abandoned Mr Wilman's RV

04:58.560 --> 05:01.520
and went off to buy our own.

05:01.560 --> 05:05.880
Which we then personalised
to suit our individual
holiday needs.

05:10.600 --> 05:12.640
JAMES:
This is what I've gone for.

05:12.680 --> 05:15.360
It's the Ford F550
National Tropical.

05:15.440 --> 05:18.360
And...it's 36 feet long.

05:18.360 --> 05:20.040
Why so massive?

05:20.080 --> 05:21.800
I wanted to modify it
in such a way

05:21.880 --> 05:24.240
that I brought a small
taste of home with me.

05:24.320 --> 05:26.440
-Can you guess what it is?
RICHARD: Er...

05:26.480 --> 05:28.360
-Brown furniture.
-A tea cosy.

05:28.360 --> 05:29.920
-A rusty motorcycle.
-No.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.320
-Follow me.
-What?

05:33.040 --> 05:35.440
Holy moly!

05:35.480 --> 05:39.080
-Whoa-ho!
-Yes, welcome to the Rack
and Pinion. What will it be?

05:39.120 --> 05:41.920
RICHARD: I'm in a pub.
JEREMY: I'm staggered.

05:41.960 --> 05:44.280
RICHARD: It's got peanuts on
the wall, terrible pictures.

05:44.320 --> 05:46.720
-Yes.
-This is fabulous. (LAUGHS)

05:46.760 --> 05:48.480
-I know.
-Warm brown beer.

05:48.520 --> 05:51.200
Yep. Would you like
a glass of Lady Petrol?

05:51.240 --> 05:55.160
-Is that rosé? Lady Petrol?
-Yes. I've equipped it
with your favourite drinks.

05:55.200 --> 05:56.760
-What's that?
-That's for you.

05:56.800 --> 05:59.120
JEREMY: Brummie's Ruin.

05:59.160 --> 06:00.920
BOTH: It's gin.
-Have you remembered
to ensure

06:00.960 --> 06:03.240
there are sufficient urine
traces in the peanuts?

06:03.280 --> 06:05.600
Yes,
I urinated on them myself.

06:05.640 --> 06:09.600
Can I just ask: why have you
got a drawing of three stroke
victims on the wall?

06:09.640 --> 06:11.200
That's us.

06:12.280 --> 06:14.280
-Er...
-What?

06:14.320 --> 06:17.520
-Dartboard.
-Yes, it's a pub.

06:17.560 --> 06:21.080
Darts is a fine game
and helped England
win a lot of wars.

06:21.120 --> 06:23.360
Darts is for people
who have no conversation.

06:23.400 --> 06:26.160
-Rubbish!
-Who wants to go to
the pub and do maths?

06:26.200 --> 06:28.640
It's no good telling me what
you want your pub to be like.

06:28.680 --> 06:31.280
-I don't want my pub--
-This is my pub.
This is what it's like.

06:31.320 --> 06:33.240
This is a traditional pub.

06:33.280 --> 06:35.440
-This is what they look like.
-This is great. It works.

06:35.480 --> 06:37.400
We're already talking
pub bollocks.

06:37.440 --> 06:39.680
James, it's my job to
ridicule you, obviously.

06:39.720 --> 06:43.640
But I can't. Because, apart
from the dartboard, you've
done an incredible job.

06:43.680 --> 06:45.880
-Thank you.
-But it isn't quite
as incredible

06:45.920 --> 06:47.960
as the job I've done.

06:50.520 --> 06:54.400
RICHARD: Whoa!
-I've gone, as you can see,
for a nautical theme.

06:54.440 --> 06:57.000
-In the desert.
-Yes, bear with me.

06:57.040 --> 06:58.760
Two-tone paintwork,
obviously.

06:58.800 --> 07:02.440
Jet ski on the back,
and then, up on the top,

07:02.480 --> 07:06.760
and this really is
the pièce de résistance,
the flying bridge.

07:06.800 --> 07:10.160
-What, so you can drive it
from outside?
-Why would you not do that?

07:10.200 --> 07:12.920
-Because you built it.
-I hate jet skis, by the way.

07:12.960 --> 07:17.080
I know, but I...
You told me my hatred
of darts is irrelevant.

07:17.120 --> 07:19.320
-You kept mentioning it.
-It does look nautical.

07:19.360 --> 07:21.480
-Shoes off. Shoes off.
JAMES AND RICHARD: What?

07:21.520 --> 07:23.200
-Shoes off.
-Why?

07:23.240 --> 07:25.360
-It's a boat.
-Oh, I hate that!

07:25.400 --> 07:27.360
I can afford
£2 million on a boat,

07:27.400 --> 07:30.680
but not a new bit of carpet
if it gets some dust on it
off my shoes.

07:30.720 --> 07:32.720
-It's a bit Surrey.
-Off.

07:32.760 --> 07:35.040
-Oh, God.
-Right, good.

07:35.080 --> 07:37.440
RICHARD:
Right, boots are off. Whoa!

07:37.480 --> 07:40.640
-What?
-Is this all bathroom?

07:41.960 --> 07:44.640
Yes, obviously.
Or lavatory.

07:44.680 --> 07:46.520
Shower here, tiled,
as you can see.

07:46.560 --> 07:48.360
Tasteful.

07:48.400 --> 07:51.360
Sink unit, vanity mirror,
restrained.

07:51.400 --> 07:54.800
And...
just pop this open like so.

07:56.120 --> 07:58.040
-Wow.
-Lower the flap,

07:58.080 --> 08:00.120
which means
that in the morning...

08:01.280 --> 08:04.560
...I can...sit down

08:04.600 --> 08:06.680
..and I can...
well, I can see the pub.

08:06.720 --> 08:09.480
As we know, luxury is
defined by light and space.

08:09.520 --> 08:11.880
JAMES: Hm?
-So this is a luxurious bog.

08:11.920 --> 08:14.120
JAMES: Correct.
-And also, look.

08:14.160 --> 08:18.200
This is not some camping
lavatory where you defecate
on a piece of plastic.

08:18.240 --> 08:19.720
Observe.

08:19.760 --> 08:21.880
(FLUSHES)

08:21.920 --> 08:23.560
Oh, it's a proper thing.

08:23.600 --> 08:26.000
Well, how, where does...
where does that go?

08:26.040 --> 08:29.520
-Underneath the RV.
-What, to, like,
a tank or something?

08:29.560 --> 08:31.720
No, underneath the RV.

08:31.760 --> 08:34.040
What, you're going to
drive off in your bathroom

08:34.080 --> 08:37.240
-leaving behind
a mound of turds?
-Yes.

08:37.280 --> 08:38.880
-Where are you gonna sleep?
-Here.

08:38.880 --> 08:41.880
This is the exact same width
as my forearm.

08:41.960 --> 08:43.520
JAMES: Oh, yes.

08:43.520 --> 08:46.960
RICHARD: It's more of
a cupboard, really, isn't it?

08:47.000 --> 08:50.760
JEREMY: The roof, however,
was a different story.

08:50.840 --> 08:53.080
-Whoa!
RICHARD: Oh, I say.

08:53.120 --> 08:55.080
Well, this is wasted space
normally, isn't it?

08:55.120 --> 08:57.320
JEREMY: Exactly.
JAMES: It's pretty good this,
Hammond.

08:57.360 --> 08:59.200
-But hang on a minute.
-What?

08:59.240 --> 09:02.880
-This is... This is very
impressive. It's very--
-Aargh! Ha-ha, ha ha-ha!

09:02.960 --> 09:05.640
-(LAUGHTER)
-Oh, yes!

09:05.640 --> 09:07.720
-Ha, ha-ha!
-Oh, ho.

09:07.760 --> 09:10.160
-So that's something
to look forward to.
-Aargh!

09:10.200 --> 09:13.160
(LAUGHS) Yeah, don't let
skin touch anything.

09:13.200 --> 09:16.960
Right, so assuming you
were able to sit
in the scaldingly hot seat.

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
-Yes.
-Under the blazing sun.

09:19.040 --> 09:20.640
-Yes.
-How does it work?

09:20.720 --> 09:22.880
Have you got brakes
and accelerator and...

09:22.880 --> 09:25.080
Accelerating.

09:25.120 --> 09:26.840
-Braking.
-Right.

09:26.880 --> 09:29.080
-Gears.
-Oh, so it really is a boat.

09:29.120 --> 09:32.200
Yeah. Look, the way I see it
is this, gentlemen.

09:32.240 --> 09:36.120
Almost no one would
want to go on holiday
in a 36-foot caravan,

09:36.160 --> 09:38.280
but everybody
would bite your arm off

09:38.320 --> 09:40.840
to go on holiday
in a 36-foot gin palace.

09:40.880 --> 09:43.120
-They're
not really that different.
-No, they're not.

09:43.160 --> 09:45.960
It's just one floats on water
and one goes on land.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.520
-Right, Hammond.
-Yes.

09:47.600 --> 09:50.960
-Where's yours?
-Over there.

09:51.000 --> 09:53.360
-What, behind the lorry?
-No, it is the lorry.
That's it.

09:53.400 --> 09:55.520
JAMES: That's not an RV.

09:55.520 --> 09:58.880
It is. Look, it's big, I can
sleep on it and it's got
a bike on the back.

09:58.960 --> 10:02.080
-That's a recreational
vehicle right there.
-This we have got to see.

10:06.440 --> 10:10.280
It's big and it needs to
move along, so a truck
is the obvious answer.

10:10.320 --> 10:12.600
-What sort of truck is it?
-I don't know. Truck.

10:12.640 --> 10:15.160
These are the ones that used
to be the U-Haul lorry. Ooh!

10:15.200 --> 10:18.960
-You've still got the sign of
the previous owner on it.
-It doesn't matter.

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
Come aboard,
leave your shoes on,

10:21.040 --> 10:22.880
cos this wood
is very splintery.

10:22.880 --> 10:25.600
RICHARD: Um...

10:25.640 --> 10:28.000
Here's the living
accommodation.

10:28.040 --> 10:30.760
-What living accommodation?
-There's a bed.

10:30.840 --> 10:33.880
There, bed. Telescope in case
I get bored in the evening.

10:33.880 --> 10:38.240
And then rocking chair
in case of visitors
and a motorcycle on the back.

10:38.280 --> 10:40.640
So, just two secs.

10:40.640 --> 10:42.520
-Stacks.
-Yeah.

10:42.520 --> 10:44.160
-Engine?
-It's got a V8.

10:44.200 --> 10:47.080
-Whose?
-Mine now,
I bought the truck.

10:47.120 --> 10:49.640
JAMES: You have made
no effort whatsoever.

10:49.640 --> 10:51.880
Oh, no, now I have,
but I've distilled it down.

10:51.880 --> 10:56.360
I haven't wasted time and
effort on complicated stuff
I don't need.

10:56.400 --> 10:58.400
-This is honest.
-So when you come to my...

10:58.440 --> 11:01.200
and say, "Please, Jeremy,
can I borrow your lavatory?"
in the morning,

11:01.240 --> 11:03.560
I'm gonna say no, cos you
accused me of wasting time.

11:03.600 --> 11:06.160
And if you want to come
to my pub for a drink
of your gin,

11:06.200 --> 11:07.760
which I've put on tap
for you, I'll say,

11:07.800 --> 11:10.120
"No, it's just
a waste of time, Hammond."

11:10.160 --> 11:12.480
I didn't realise we were
setting up a sort of stock
exchange of resources

11:12.520 --> 11:15.240
-needed by
the roaming camper.
-Hammond?

11:15.280 --> 11:18.360
-Yes?
-Your lorry - I'm not
gonna call it an RV...

11:18.400 --> 11:20.800
JEREMY: It isn't an RV.
-...is dismal.

11:20.840 --> 11:23.200
God strewth.

11:23.240 --> 11:25.160
JEREMY:
On that note, we set off...

11:26.960 --> 11:29.440
...to see what our RVs
and Hammond's lorry,

11:29.480 --> 11:30.760
were like on the road.

11:37.320 --> 11:40.440
So, let's have a look at what
we've got on the dash here.

11:40.480 --> 11:43.960
Left-hand panel: don't know
what any of that does.

11:44.000 --> 11:46.640
Central panel,
four warning lights.

11:46.680 --> 11:48.080
Don't know what they're for.

11:48.120 --> 11:49.480
They've got
handwritten notices

11:49.520 --> 11:51.600
but that's all rubbed off.

11:51.640 --> 11:55.640
Everything on the right-hand
panel: CB radio,
stereo tape player etcetera -

11:55.680 --> 11:57.560
all broken.
Switch here?

11:57.600 --> 12:00.480
-(CLICKING)
-Nothing.

12:00.520 --> 12:04.760
Air con is good, though,
and that, frankly,
is all that matters.

12:04.800 --> 12:06.320
It's 100 degrees out there.

12:11.520 --> 12:14.440
Hello, viewers.
You join me driving my pub.

12:14.480 --> 12:17.280
And given that the two things
I do most in life

12:17.320 --> 12:19.680
are driving
and going to the pub,

12:19.720 --> 12:22.960
this is a perfect
arrangement, isn't it?

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
Go on, change up,
you bastard.

12:25.040 --> 12:26.920
-(GEAR CHANGES)
-Thank you.

12:31.600 --> 12:34.200
Nice view, that.

12:34.240 --> 12:36.200
Better than the view
from my pub back home.

12:36.240 --> 12:39.280
That's a view of a wall
and some bins.

12:42.000 --> 12:44.720
Hello, America.
I'm here to explore.

12:46.560 --> 12:48.200
I'm not gonna push it
hard up this hill,

12:48.240 --> 12:50.280
cos I've noticed
it's running quite hot.

12:51.680 --> 12:54.280
Yeah, doing er...
15 miles an hour,

12:54.320 --> 12:56.440
but I'm really not
in a race.

12:59.360 --> 13:01.760
Yeah, I'm down
to 13 miles an hour.

13:04.360 --> 13:05.720
Which is plenty.

13:10.000 --> 13:12.280
-(BANG)
-That's... That's my engine.

13:12.320 --> 13:14.880
-(BANG)
-My engine is backfiring.

13:14.920 --> 13:17.160
-(SERIES OF BANGS)
-Yeah.

13:19.400 --> 13:21.880
You don't wanna
break down round here.

13:21.920 --> 13:24.840
This is where
all the madmen live...

13:24.880 --> 13:29.160
...that follow you in pick-up
trucks and black lorries.

13:30.880 --> 13:31.920
What is...?

13:33.640 --> 13:35.560
What's that?

13:38.440 --> 13:39.760
What the hell?

13:50.920 --> 13:52.440
Did you see that guy?

13:54.080 --> 13:56.280
I didn't see anybody. Where?

13:56.320 --> 13:58.160
What guy?

13:58.200 --> 14:01.480
The guy at the side of
the road. Did you see him?

14:01.520 --> 14:02.960
No, I didn't see anybody.

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
No,
there was nobody in the road.

14:05.040 --> 14:06.920
RICHARD: Jeremy.

14:06.960 --> 14:08.560
Why aren't you driving
yours on the roof?

14:08.600 --> 14:10.320
Well, it's annoying.

14:10.360 --> 14:12.600
It turns out off-road
I can drive it on the roof,

14:12.640 --> 14:14.240
but when I'm on the road,

14:14.280 --> 14:16.920
there's a law
that says I can't.

14:16.960 --> 14:19.360
What, that you can't drive
your RV from the roof?

14:19.400 --> 14:22.840
-Yeah, I know.
-It's health and safety
gone mad.

14:22.880 --> 14:24.440
It's ridiculous.

14:24.480 --> 14:28.400
My only real issue, and
it is - it's significant -

14:28.440 --> 14:32.800
is that my idle speed
is 5,000rpm,

14:32.840 --> 14:35.880
which means my foot is
now not on the accelerator

14:35.920 --> 14:38.760
and I'm now doing 48.

14:38.800 --> 14:40.720
Oh, Christ...
Hang on, wait, stand by.

14:42.000 --> 14:43.920
(REVVING)

14:46.000 --> 14:48.520
You have to jab
the throttle like that,

14:48.560 --> 14:50.640
to get it to stop
accelerating,

14:50.680 --> 14:53.600
which, of course, causes
you to accelerate more.

14:53.640 --> 14:54.920
So if there's an emergency,

14:54.960 --> 14:58.080
I must
accelerate like that...

14:58.120 --> 15:01.000
...to then be able
to slow down.

15:04.520 --> 15:05.960
Look at that.

15:06.000 --> 15:07.320
If he had a purple jacket on

15:07.360 --> 15:08.640
he'd look like
one of those men

15:08.680 --> 15:11.960
who takes old ladies
on tours of North Wales.

15:12.000 --> 15:15.160
JAMES: I'm going to pull in
in front of you,
so tell me when I can.

15:16.400 --> 15:19.080
Not yet. Not yet.

15:20.160 --> 15:22.840
Not yet. Not yet.

15:24.160 --> 15:26.720
Not yet. Not yet.

15:28.120 --> 15:29.720
Now.

15:29.760 --> 15:32.240
Can you speed up a bit,
Hammond?
We're all bunching up.

15:32.280 --> 15:33.800
Urrrrh!

15:33.840 --> 15:36.240
I can't go
much faster than this.

15:36.280 --> 15:40.440
It starts to overheat
quite badly and suddenly.

15:40.480 --> 15:44.120
(LAUGHS) I'm not sure
I'd trust us three doing...

15:44.160 --> 15:45.640
doing this.

15:48.280 --> 15:51.280
Soon we arrived in
a typical American town.

15:54.600 --> 15:58.240
Which, of course,
had a typical RV campsite.

16:00.400 --> 16:03.600
This'll do. We're home.

16:03.640 --> 16:06.000
So, we decided
to check in for the night.

16:10.120 --> 16:11.560
Ow.

16:11.600 --> 16:14.200
33 I'm looking for.

16:15.960 --> 16:17.240
That's me.

16:26.480 --> 16:28.200
Stop, stop.

16:28.240 --> 16:30.320
-Stop. Stop.
-(THUD)

16:30.360 --> 16:33.120
(ENGINE STILL RUNNING)

16:33.160 --> 16:36.640
Idle speed has gone
completely berserk.

16:37.840 --> 16:39.280
I do apologise, everybody.

16:39.320 --> 16:41.120
There's literally
nothing I can do.

16:41.160 --> 16:44.400
That is my idle speed.

16:44.440 --> 16:47.840
-(KEYS JANGLE)
-Aargh! Ha-ha, ha-ha!

16:47.880 --> 16:53.600
My ignition key is at
3,000 degrees centigrade.

16:53.640 --> 16:57.320
Sorry, everyone.
Sorry about the noise.

16:57.360 --> 16:59.120
I know,
we'll use the director.

16:59.160 --> 17:00.520
Sorry, mate,
if you could just

17:00.560 --> 17:02.440
turn the engine off
that would be great.

17:05.280 --> 17:08.760
Call 911. He's going to need
some fingers in a minute.

17:10.080 --> 17:11.760
-Ow!
-(ENGINE OFF)

17:11.800 --> 17:13.800
-(BLEEP)
-(CLATTERING)

17:13.800 --> 17:15.760
(LAUGHS)

17:17.440 --> 17:19.240
Yeah, it does that.

17:19.280 --> 17:21.080
How hot
are those ignition keys?

17:21.160 --> 17:23.800
-Hot!
-(LAUGHS)

17:23.880 --> 17:26.080
Not as hot as
the cameraman's right leg.

17:26.160 --> 17:28.040
CAMERAMAN:
Yeah, that nearly took my...

17:28.080 --> 17:30.800
That was flame
enveloped your right leg.

17:31.880 --> 17:33.720
Oh, sh-- Oh, guys.

17:33.760 --> 17:35.640
We have an emergency.

17:38.920 --> 17:40.480
Yeah.

17:43.880 --> 17:46.560
RICHARD: On the other, more
peaceful side of the park,

17:46.640 --> 17:49.560
I'd settled down
to soak up life in my row.

17:51.000 --> 17:52.920
Hello, neighbour.

17:59.400 --> 18:02.080
I'll come over later, maybe
play cards or something.

18:07.920 --> 18:11.760
That dog's taking a wee.

18:11.800 --> 18:16.080
Meanwhile, at the Rack and
Pinion, it was opening time.

18:16.080 --> 18:18.080
(DRAMATIC MUSIC)

18:18.160 --> 18:20.480
(WHIRRING)

18:38.240 --> 18:40.000
Drop by for a beer later
if you like.

18:46.160 --> 18:48.800
JEREMY:
As James got acquainted
with his neighbours,

18:48.880 --> 18:53.080
Hammond was showing me
the view from his veranda.

18:53.160 --> 18:55.560
There is a compound there
where you take your dog
for a crap.

18:55.560 --> 18:58.640
JEREMY: Is that...
is that a dog lavatory?
-Yes.

18:58.680 --> 19:01.920
My... My porch overlooks it.

19:01.960 --> 19:03.920
Can I tell you
what a member of our crew -

19:03.960 --> 19:06.320
who I won't name because
it'd be embarrassing,
but it was--

19:06.320 --> 19:09.080
-What does it begin with?
-It was Ellis the
photographer it begins with.

19:09.080 --> 19:11.960
He said to me, is when people
come round these places,

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
-what you do is...
-Yeah?

19:14.040 --> 19:16.760
(SNIGGERS)
It's not for camera.

19:16.800 --> 19:21.000
You put the word
"anal" in front of all of the
names of the caravans.

19:21.040 --> 19:22.960
-(LAUGHS)
-So you've got
Anal Wanderer...

-Anal Desire.

19:35.560 --> 19:38.520
-(BOTH LAUGH)
-That's what you do!

19:38.560 --> 19:44.400
JEREMY: Over at the pub,
James was dispensing drinks
to the locals.

19:44.440 --> 19:47.760
It's a bit lively, sir.
I'm sorry, but the pub
has been on the move

19:47.800 --> 19:49.800
-and rattled around
quite a bit.
WOMAN: Oh, I bet.

19:49.800 --> 19:52.560
If you leave that just to
settle for a few minutes.

19:52.560 --> 19:54.400
I'll try a warm brown,
please.

19:54.440 --> 19:57.320
(SQUIRTING)

19:57.400 --> 19:59.560
WOMAN: More foamy?
-A little bit foamy.

19:59.640 --> 20:02.240
If you'd like to just let
that settle for a bit, sir.

20:02.280 --> 20:06.320
I think I'll go with
a Jack Daniels.

20:06.400 --> 20:10.520
JEREMY: Having run out of
bottom jokes, Hammond and I
had gone for a walk

20:10.560 --> 20:14.800
in what's billed as the
great American wilderness.

20:22.320 --> 20:24.240
-Is that a scrapyard?
-Yes.

20:28.440 --> 20:31.640
RICHARD: I do prefer
the Lake District.

20:31.680 --> 20:35.160
JEREMY: Back at the pub,
James was entertaining
his guests

20:35.200 --> 20:37.800
with his conversation.

20:37.880 --> 20:41.000
What you call
warm British beer to us
is cellar temperature,

20:41.040 --> 20:45.920
which is not as cold as
a refrigerator but colder
than room temperature.

20:45.960 --> 20:47.880
Right, right, right.

20:50.560 --> 20:52.320
Erm...anybody mind
if I have one?

20:52.400 --> 20:54.320
-No. Help yourself.
-No. Help yourself.

20:58.440 --> 21:01.080
JEREMY: I mean,
there must be
more to it than this.

21:01.080 --> 21:03.000
RICHARD: You do wonder
what people do.

21:03.040 --> 21:05.160
JEREMY: I don't wonder.
I know what they do.

21:05.200 --> 21:06.960
They wife-swap.

21:08.080 --> 21:10.040
-Sunset?
-It's lovely.

21:16.920 --> 21:18.080
-Hammond.
-What?

21:18.160 --> 21:20.560
-Hammond. Do you...?
-What?

21:20.640 --> 21:22.560
-Did you see that?
-See what?

21:27.280 --> 21:30.560
-What?
-No, nothing.

21:30.640 --> 21:33.000
-I'm going to turn in.
-Yeah, you're right. Sleep.

21:33.040 --> 21:35.320
JAMES: Well, this year,
because we've had
a record summer,

21:35.400 --> 21:36.760
it's actually
very warm and sunny

21:36.800 --> 21:38.720
but usually...
September's all right

21:38.760 --> 21:42.240
but by the time you get to
November, certainly,
it's getting cold.

21:42.280 --> 21:44.320
The worst bit in England
is sort of January...

21:46.720 --> 21:49.960
JEREMY:
After James had run out
of his conversation,

21:50.000 --> 21:51.880
he shut his pub for the night

21:51.920 --> 21:55.320
and came round to my place
with a plan.

21:57.400 --> 21:58.560
Clarkson.

22:00.160 --> 22:01.400
Clarkson.

22:01.440 --> 22:03.440
-What?
-I've got an idea.

22:03.480 --> 22:06.920
-What?
-To go and burgle
Hammond's tent.

22:06.960 --> 22:10.120
You know how he's been
burgled before
and he just doesn't notice?

22:12.880 --> 22:16.640
-Oh, my God, yes.
-Exactly.

22:16.680 --> 22:20.400
JAMES: Hammond claimed
after he was burgled
on holiday last year,

22:20.440 --> 22:25.000
he hadn't woken up because
the burglars had gassed him.

22:25.040 --> 22:27.000
Yeah, right.

22:27.040 --> 22:30.200
-Where's his lorry tent?
-The far side.

23:11.680 --> 23:14.240
-Good morning.
-Hm. Dubious.

Ow.

23:23.520 --> 23:25.920
-What?
-Have you stolen my bag?

23:25.960 --> 23:28.240
-What?
-Have you stolen
my bag?

23:28.280 --> 23:29.680
-No.
-Yes, you have.

23:29.720 --> 23:31.160
I haven't.

23:32.960 --> 23:34.960
Took everything.

23:35.000 --> 23:36.400
That's all I have.

23:36.440 --> 23:38.000
-You've been burgled?
-Yes.

23:38.040 --> 23:40.160
They must have gassed you.

23:40.200 --> 23:41.760
That's all I can think of,
Hammond.

23:41.800 --> 23:44.760
I know that you're saying
that to be funny.
Ha-ha!

23:44.800 --> 23:46.720
Well, that's what you said
when you got burgled
in France.

23:46.760 --> 23:49.560
-Because it probably was.
-But you probably
were again last night.

-You haven't got it?
Seriously?

23:51.760 --> 23:53.160
I haven't got your bag.

23:57.360 --> 23:58.720
James.

23:58.760 --> 24:00.440
-James...
-Hang on.

24:00.480 --> 24:03.080
-Have you stolen my bag?
-You what?

24:03.120 --> 24:04.960
-Have you stolen my bag?
-No.

24:07.760 --> 24:10.720
(BOTH CHUCKLING)

24:10.760 --> 24:14.280
He's just this
lonely little figure.

24:14.320 --> 24:16.760
(LAUGHING)

24:16.800 --> 24:19.120
Shall we let him have
breakfast before we admit
that we've got his bag?

24:19.160 --> 24:21.360
Well...

24:21.400 --> 24:24.000
I don't really want to sit
eating breakfast with him
naked, that's the thing.

24:25.360 --> 24:28.720
Hammond, I think
we've solved your crime.

24:28.760 --> 24:31.240
We've solved it.

24:31.280 --> 24:34.480
We have found the gas
canisters, look, here.

24:34.520 --> 24:36.160
It's a lot of gas.

24:37.280 --> 24:39.240
If you've had
this much gas...

24:39.280 --> 24:41.160
It looks like
a litre and a half of gas.

24:41.200 --> 24:44.240
It's interesting they've
spelt gas wrong, look.

24:44.280 --> 24:46.320
Well, they got
the first letter right.

24:46.360 --> 24:47.840
Look, here.

24:47.880 --> 24:49.320
You're saying
I gassed myself?

24:49.360 --> 24:51.720
They weren't both full
when I started.

24:51.760 --> 24:54.240
-(JEREMY CHUCKLES)
-That's because
you'd already started them.

24:54.280 --> 24:56.200
(JEREMY LAUGHS)

25:00.960 --> 25:03.400
JEREMY: Having given
Hammond his clothes back,

25:03.440 --> 25:06.680
we met for breakfast
at the pub.

25:06.720 --> 25:10.280
I was kept awake for some
time last night by the man in
the neighbouring RV

25:10.320 --> 25:12.680
-scratching his eczema.
-Ooh.

25:12.720 --> 25:14.520
Or might have been
sanding a table.

25:14.560 --> 25:17.120
No, I had a couple
in the one next to me.

25:17.160 --> 25:20.920
-And when I say next to me,
I mean here.
-Yes.

25:20.960 --> 25:23.160
-(QUIETLY) Why do they
do that?
-I don't know.

25:23.200 --> 25:25.000
Nevada's massive.

25:25.040 --> 25:27.160
Why would you park your...
"Right, we're going to Nevada

25:27.200 --> 25:30.120
because it's massive and empty
and I'm going to park there,

25:30.160 --> 25:34.040
so that they can hear
the precise moment
when my wife and I...

25:35.160 --> 25:37.840
...do grown-up things."

25:37.880 --> 25:43.120
JEREMY: We then discussed
what holiday activity we'd
do to fill the day.

25:43.160 --> 25:45.720
-Balloon rides.
-I hate balloons!

25:45.760 --> 25:48.040
-The world's largest
gift shop.
-No.

25:48.080 --> 25:50.240
How do they know it's
the world's largest?

25:50.280 --> 25:53.080
-Is it a shop containing
the world's largest gift?
-No.

25:53.120 --> 25:55.040
-(OTHER TWO LAUGH)
-Yes.

25:55.080 --> 25:58.960
Is there anything
a bit more cultural,
like Indian art?

25:59.000 --> 26:00.280
Or Native American,
as we should say.

26:00.320 --> 26:02.080
You just said Indian,
you racist.

26:02.120 --> 26:03.760
That's not actually racist.

26:03.800 --> 26:05.600
James, we're not going to
look at Native American art.

26:05.640 --> 26:06.760
-Why not?
-It's rubbish.

26:06.800 --> 26:08.600
How do you know it's rubbish?

26:08.640 --> 26:10.560
-Because I've seen it.
It's rubbish.
-You haven't seen all of it.

26:10.600 --> 26:13.960
Well, I've seen some.
I've seen enough of it
to know it's dreary.

26:14.000 --> 26:16.600
-Sunrise meditation.
-JAMES: Oh, that'll be good.

26:16.640 --> 26:18.640
It isn't good. What would
be good about that?

26:18.680 --> 26:21.240
I don't know because I
haven't seen it but I'm
prepared to have a look.

26:21.280 --> 26:24.280
Why don't we...
You know those big Baja

26:24.320 --> 26:27.800
off-road 28-inch suspension
travel things?

26:27.840 --> 26:29.800
-Dune racer type things.
-Dune racers.

26:29.840 --> 26:33.120
Why don't we get
three of those and belt
around in the desert?

26:33.160 --> 26:35.240
-Yes.
-Cos that would be bovine.

26:35.280 --> 26:36.480
I wouldn't learn anything
from that.

26:36.520 --> 26:38.240
I'd rather go and do
something cultural.

26:38.280 --> 26:39.880
Blasting around a dune
sounds like fun.

26:39.920 --> 26:41.680
Come on. I tell you what,

26:41.720 --> 26:45.200
-you want to go and do
Native American art.
-Mm-hm.

26:45.240 --> 26:48.080
-We want to go dune racing.
Yes?
-Right.

26:48.120 --> 26:50.440
Let's have a vote.

26:50.480 --> 26:52.520
(REVVING)

26:52.560 --> 26:54.480
JEREMY:
I would be driving this.

26:55.680 --> 26:58.520
A Jakes Fabworks JF5U.

27:00.760 --> 27:03.320
James would be driving this.

27:03.360 --> 27:05.840
An Alumi Craft Class 10.

27:07.840 --> 27:09.800
And Hammond would have this.

27:11.120 --> 27:13.040
A plastic green
pick-up truck.

27:17.800 --> 27:21.720
OK. Now,
this is supposed to be...

27:21.760 --> 27:24.040
Ow! ..a Volkswagen Beetle.

27:24.080 --> 27:26.160
Because that is
where this sport began -

27:26.200 --> 27:28.600
people racing Bugs
round the desert.

27:30.640 --> 27:34.640
But it's got a 2.4 litre
Chevrolet engine...

27:36.840 --> 27:39.840
and a sequential gearbox.

27:39.880 --> 27:43.240
The only thing it really has
in common with a Beetle
is nothing.

27:46.360 --> 27:48.280
Jumping!

27:49.480 --> 27:51.200
Ha-ha!

27:51.240 --> 27:54.840
Over we go, 16 inches
of suspension travel
at the front.

27:59.800 --> 28:03.280
18 at the back means landing
is really very comfortable.

28:11.520 --> 28:13.440
Oh, yes!

28:16.960 --> 28:20.880
My 2013 Currie underneath
this plastic pick-up body

28:20.920 --> 28:24.280
has the same tubular space
range chassis as
the other two.

28:24.320 --> 28:25.920
But I've only got
a two-litre engine.

28:25.960 --> 28:30.560
However, it's a Ford Eco
Boost, so it's turbo-charged.

28:30.600 --> 28:33.800
And they've tuned it
so it's putting out
just shy...

28:33.840 --> 28:35.280
Landing!

28:35.320 --> 28:38.000
...of 300 brake horsepower.
(LAUGHS)

28:40.040 --> 28:42.080
And now I'm gonna fly again.

28:43.160 --> 28:45.560
Aagh! Ha-ha-ha!

28:46.600 --> 28:48.720
This is bliss.

28:48.760 --> 28:53.200
RICHARD: Meanwhile,
in the Alumi Craft
Class 10...

28:53.240 --> 28:56.120
(COUGHS)
I've got dust in my face.

28:56.160 --> 28:57.520
It doesn't have a windscreen.

28:57.560 --> 29:00.800
I don't like cars with no
windscreen. (COUGHS)

29:00.840 --> 29:02.760
Why do I let the others
talk me into this?

29:02.800 --> 29:04.680
Why don't I just tell them
to bugger off?

29:08.560 --> 29:10.680
RICHARD: Ahhh-ha-ha!

29:10.720 --> 29:12.800
Last time I did that
it ended very badly!

29:15.760 --> 29:18.640
The races they do in these
things are enormous.

29:18.680 --> 29:21.440
Hundreds, sometimes
1,000 miles or more.

29:21.480 --> 29:25.360
Sometimes they'll spend
nine hours a day
in the driving seat.

29:27.120 --> 29:29.040
Oh! I so want one of these.

29:31.360 --> 29:33.280
Come on, let's have
some air here!

29:35.040 --> 29:37.160
Yeah! Ha-ha-ha!

29:37.200 --> 29:38.720
What a riot!

29:40.760 --> 29:44.840
How can James May
not enjoy this?

29:44.880 --> 29:47.840
JEREMY: As it happened,
he was starting to enjoy it.

29:48.960 --> 29:50.880
And weeeee!

29:54.400 --> 29:57.080
Getting sideways a bit.

29:57.120 --> 29:58.400
Whoa.

30:00.920 --> 30:03.160
Watch me fly! Here I go.

30:06.000 --> 30:08.680
Ha-ha!
I'm gonna do one more.

30:10.800 --> 30:13.120
JEREMY: After Billy Bob May
had had his fun...

30:13.160 --> 30:15.560
Weeeee!

30:15.600 --> 30:18.640
-...we all stopped
for a breather.
-Yes.

30:18.680 --> 30:21.720
I don't like admitting
you're right, but I can be
magnanimous. It's brilliant.

30:21.760 --> 30:24.120
You've wasted your life
with Chopin and plywood.

30:24.160 --> 30:25.880
You're a dune racer.

30:25.920 --> 30:28.720
You've always been
a dune racer, you just
didn't know you were.

30:28.760 --> 30:30.560
It was just fantastic,
and it's comfortable.

30:30.600 --> 30:33.240
That's the thing. It's
comfortable motorsport
because of the suspension.

30:33.280 --> 30:34.600
It's just... It's brilliant.

30:34.640 --> 30:37.200
-It's cheapskate motorsport.
-Is it?

30:37.240 --> 30:39.880
It's cheapskate motorsport
for people with dicky backs,
that's what it is.

30:39.920 --> 30:41.800
Because landing is so soft.

30:41.840 --> 30:44.320
-Oh, sometimes I'm thinking,
have I landed?
-Yes.

30:44.360 --> 30:46.760
I've got a brilliant idea.
What are you looking at?

30:49.840 --> 30:51.160
RICHARD: What?

30:51.200 --> 30:53.120
There's something glinting
up there.

30:56.480 --> 30:57.920
-There isn't.
-Yeah, whatever.

30:57.960 --> 30:59.240
It's just...

30:59.280 --> 31:00.640
Anyway, what's
your brilliant idea?

31:00.680 --> 31:02.000
-Anyway, I've got
a brilliant idea.
-What?

31:02.040 --> 31:03.280
Time trial, flying lap,

31:03.320 --> 31:05.080
one at a time
against the clock.

31:05.120 --> 31:07.640
I'll go first.

31:07.680 --> 31:09.800
You really...
You must put that right.

31:09.840 --> 31:11.560
-(LAUGHING)
-Where's me car?

31:11.600 --> 31:15.200
-He really has taken to it,
hasn't he?
-He really has.

31:15.240 --> 31:19.800
JEREMY: Having
jumped back in, Billy Bob
embarked on his flying lap.

31:21.120 --> 31:22.800
Here he comes.

31:22.840 --> 31:24.760
Go!

31:27.040 --> 31:28.960
Here we go.

31:30.600 --> 31:32.280
Wayyyy!

31:32.320 --> 31:34.880
-That's James May!
-(LAUGHS)

31:34.920 --> 31:36.840
It's just not right, is it?

31:38.960 --> 31:40.720
What's next? He's gonna
take up cage fighting?

31:40.760 --> 31:41.880
(LAUGHS)

31:43.640 --> 31:45.560
I'm flying!

31:47.440 --> 31:49.360
-Oh, my God!
-(LAUGHS)

31:51.400 --> 31:53.400
Look at this. He's actually
kicking the arse out.

31:59.800 --> 32:01.800
-57 seconds.
-Well, we don't know
whether that's fast or not

32:01.840 --> 32:03.640
but it is less than a minute.

32:03.680 --> 32:06.360
Is that the first time
he's done anything
in less than a minute?

32:06.400 --> 32:09.360
-He can't open a car door
in less than a minute.
-No. Or sign his name.

32:09.400 --> 32:12.720
No, that's two minutes,
definitely.

32:12.760 --> 32:15.960
-Biggles is back.
-I can do a slightly
better one than that.

32:16.000 --> 32:18.920
-Can I have another go?
-Oh, for God's sake!

32:18.960 --> 32:21.400
JEREMY: Next it was my turn.

32:21.440 --> 32:23.280
I just wanna say, Hammond.

32:23.320 --> 32:27.080
-What?
-You have twice as much
horsepower as me,

32:27.120 --> 32:30.200
and, May, you have
50 horsepower
more than I've got.

32:30.240 --> 32:34.280
So it's only my immense skill
that's going to put me
in contention here.

32:34.320 --> 32:36.080
-Is it?
-Well, what else is there?

32:36.120 --> 32:38.800
He won't have any excuses
ready for the end
at this rate.

32:38.840 --> 32:44.240
Yours weighs less.
It's 200 kilograms
lighter than this.

32:44.280 --> 32:49.000
BOTH: Ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma.
-I'm just saying,
in case I'm not as quick.

32:49.040 --> 32:53.280
RICHARD: Eventually, Mr
Racing Excuses was underway.

32:53.320 --> 32:55.560
Here he comes,
into his flying lap.

32:55.600 --> 32:56.720
(REVVING)

33:00.560 --> 33:02.480
Right, here we go.

33:04.800 --> 33:06.720
(REVVING)

33:09.800 --> 33:11.440
-Did I make that much noise?
-Yes.

33:15.400 --> 33:17.320
Concentrating very hard.

33:22.240 --> 33:23.560
He's not very good
through there.

33:26.760 --> 33:28.680
Getting a bit squirrely now.

33:31.560 --> 33:33.480
No, he's rubbish
through there.

33:34.600 --> 33:36.680
No! I was airborne there

33:36.720 --> 33:39.280
long enough for them
to serve me their snacks.

33:43.000 --> 33:44.920
Get it straight.

33:56.680 --> 33:58.480
And there we are.

33:58.520 --> 34:01.760
I don't know how I've done,
but it felt pretty good
to me.

34:06.520 --> 34:11.640
There are few things in life
I enjoy more than delivering
bad news to Jeremy Clarkson.

34:11.680 --> 34:13.600
It's possibly
my favourite thing.

34:15.440 --> 34:17.360
Forcing myself
not to do a little dance.

34:18.880 --> 34:20.960
How much faster was I?

34:21.000 --> 34:24.160
Well, unless your seconds
were smaller,

34:24.160 --> 34:27.440
you were slower,
because you were 58.5.

34:27.480 --> 34:29.760
-What was he?
-57.81.

34:32.120 --> 34:34.040
What that means is
he beat you.

34:36.560 --> 34:38.480
I cannot believe that.

34:40.040 --> 34:41.960
Has anybody got a gun?

34:44.440 --> 34:48.440
JAMES: Finally, it was
the turn of Ricky Redneck.

34:48.480 --> 34:50.320
-Right, ready with
the stop watch.
-Here we go.

34:51.840 --> 34:53.760
(REVVING)

34:56.400 --> 34:58.320
This is how you do this.

35:01.600 --> 35:05.080
Oh, yeah.

35:05.120 --> 35:09.280
-He's in a pick-up truck,
on a loose surface.
-Yeah, he's at home.

35:13.400 --> 35:15.440
You know at the moment
you're winning?

35:15.480 --> 35:17.640
-Yeah.
-In a minute, you won't be.

35:20.560 --> 35:23.080
-What are you looking at?
-That glint.

35:26.040 --> 35:27.320
-You see it?
-No.

35:28.600 --> 35:30.280
Thrashing air!

35:31.640 --> 35:33.600
Ah-ha-ha!

35:35.200 --> 35:36.560
Into the left-hander.

35:36.600 --> 35:37.920
-Keep it tight.
-(PING)

35:37.960 --> 35:39.480
Oh, what was that?

35:39.520 --> 35:41.440
What the hell was that?

35:43.680 --> 35:46.160
-That was...
-What's the matter with him?

35:47.520 --> 35:50.160
Has he bust the gear box?

35:50.160 --> 35:51.920
What...
Not very quick.

35:51.960 --> 35:53.480
What was the matter?

35:53.520 --> 35:55.280
That was the weirdest thing.

35:55.320 --> 35:57.200
-What?
-It's like a ricochet.

35:59.760 --> 36:03.600
JAMES: As I wasn't interested
in Hammond's excuses...

36:03.640 --> 36:05.960
...we got back into our RVs
and hit the road.

36:08.760 --> 36:13.600
Ping, it was like a rico...
like it came off something.

36:13.640 --> 36:15.560
I suppose it could have
been a stone.

36:20.920 --> 36:22.960
JEREMY OVER RADIO:
May, are you behind me?

36:23.000 --> 36:26.480
Is my RV drooping slightly?

36:26.520 --> 36:28.640
Well, funnily enough
I was just looking at that.

36:28.640 --> 36:30.760
I would say
it's very down on the left.

36:35.640 --> 36:37.360
That's broken, isn't it?

36:37.400 --> 36:38.960
Yeah, it's leaning a lot.

36:39.000 --> 36:41.840
Mate, it really is leaning.
That's collapsed.

36:41.880 --> 36:43.520
That's how it's
supposed to be.

36:43.560 --> 36:45.640
Yeah, some distance between
the body and the ground.

36:45.640 --> 36:48.680
Yeah, you can see
more wheel on this side
than the other side.

36:53.160 --> 36:57.760
JAMES: However, as I wasn't
interested in Clarkson's
mechanical issues either,

36:57.800 --> 37:00.320
we got back
on the road again.

37:00.360 --> 37:02.480
Right, so here's
the situation.

37:02.520 --> 37:06.880
I'm driving my RV
with an overheating,
over-revving engine,

37:06.920 --> 37:09.840
and collapsed suspension,
on an interstate.

37:11.400 --> 37:13.320
Feels safe, that.

37:18.160 --> 37:21.520
JAMES: Soon it was time
to find a campsite,

37:21.560 --> 37:26.080
and since we didn't
fancy another night
in a horrible RV park,

37:26.120 --> 37:28.760
and we had
all the comforts we needed,

37:28.800 --> 37:32.040
we decided to freestyle it
in the wilderness.

37:34.560 --> 37:35.960
I think it's
an excellent idea.

37:36.000 --> 37:39.640
I mean, dune buggy racing is
fantastic, and I won,

37:39.640 --> 37:42.000
but it is quite hot
and sweaty and dusty

37:42.040 --> 37:47.000
and we can balance
that with peace and quiet
and a starry sky.

37:47.040 --> 37:48.960
I mean, that's gonna be
fantastic out here.

37:50.800 --> 37:52.680
I might write a few lines
of verse.

37:55.680 --> 38:00.160
So, we turned off
the interstate to find
a nice spot to park up.

38:02.080 --> 38:06.680
Oh, yeah, now we are getting
into the great outdoors.

38:09.640 --> 38:12.000

38:12.040 --> 38:15.640

we found the perfect spot
at the side of a lake.

-I can't stop.

38:23.760 --> 38:25.640

38:50.160 --> 38:51.960
Right.

38:52.000 --> 38:55.760
With no help from the crew,
I removed the jet ski...

38:57.120 --> 38:59.560
Excellent.

38:59.600 --> 39:03.480

-And that's a wrap.

47:26.480 --> 47:29.200
It's an engine where pushrods
activate the valve train.

47:29.240 --> 47:30.840
The valves on top
of the cylinders

47:30.880 --> 47:33.080
have to open and close
to let the mixture get out.

47:33.120 --> 47:36.520
Rather than having camshafts
over the top doing that,
opening them,

47:36.560 --> 47:38.680
they have a single camshaft
at the bottom

47:38.720 --> 47:41.360
that operates rods
that push the valves.

47:41.400 --> 47:44.160

and can't rev quickly.

47:44.200 --> 47:47.120
They have bigger capacities
with long stroke, which makes
the engine bigger.

47:47.160 --> 47:51.040
The problem is,
for an equal capacity engine,
with overhead cams,

47:51.080 --> 47:54.240
the engine would be bigger
but you wouldn't need
the extra capacity

47:54.280 --> 47:57.560
because it would rev higher
and deliver more power
at a higher RPM.

47:57.600 --> 48:00.560
But, on the other hand,
if you had a high-revving
sports car engine,

48:00.600 --> 48:03.560
such as an Italian one,
you would have a very
over square piston dimension,

48:03.600 --> 48:05.480
which would make
the engine squatter,

48:05.520 --> 48:07.760
and a dry sump,
which would allow you
to mount it lower...

48:56.600 --> 48:59.240
weren't strong enough
to take the forces involved,

1:00:51.000 --> 1:00:53.000
Oh, this is just heaven.

1:00:54.720 --> 1:00:57.000
A lavatory
with a flying bridge.

1:00:58.480 --> 1:01:01.280
I mean, what I've done here
is I have turned

1:01:01.320 --> 1:01:04.640
one of the most dreary
driving experiences
in the world

1:01:04.680 --> 1:01:06.600
into one of the best.

1:01:08.560 --> 1:01:11.400
I honestly believe that
sometimes my genius...

1:01:12.720 --> 1:01:14.680
...it generates gravity.

1:01:17.360 --> 1:01:20.440
JAMES: Meanwhile,
on the rougher route...

1:01:20.480 --> 1:01:22.640
Oh...

1:01:22.680 --> 1:01:25.360
James, I'm not sure
about this.

1:01:25.400 --> 1:01:28.720
JAMES: Well,
it's the shortest way.

1:01:28.760 --> 1:01:31.960
I know this may look
a bit mad but people
obviously do this in RVs,

1:01:32.000 --> 1:01:34.720
cos you see them parked
out in the middle of nowhere.

1:01:34.760 --> 1:01:37.480
Even if it's only
making meth.

1:01:37.520 --> 1:01:41.400
However, soon the terrain
started to get much rougher.

1:01:41.440 --> 1:01:43.360
(RATTLING AND CLATTERING)

1:01:45.480 --> 1:01:47.880

1:01:49.160 --> 1:01:50.200
Shit!

1:01:56.400 --> 1:01:57.800
Come on, come on.

1:02:00.920 --> 1:02:03.520
Come on, come on, come on!

1:02:03.560 --> 1:02:05.520
Ahhh, ha-ha!

1:02:13.240 --> 1:02:14.920
Argh! Argh!

1:02:16.160 --> 1:02:17.600

1:02:17.640 --> 1:02:19.480
Woah! Shit!

1:02:23.240 --> 1:02:26.520
Hammond,
your bike's fallen off.

1:02:26.560 --> 1:02:28.840
Oh, bloody hell,
I'll go back and get it.

1:02:28.880 --> 1:02:31.280
Er...I wouldn't bother,
to be honest.

1:02:32.800 --> 1:02:34.280
(GROANING)

1:02:34.320 --> 1:02:37.400
That's the...kick-start.

1:02:37.440 --> 1:02:38.520
The exhaust is wedged
under the back wheel.

1:02:38.560 --> 1:02:40.080
The kick-starter's come off.

1:02:40.120 --> 1:02:42.240
The handlebars are bent,
the fork's twisted.

1:02:42.280 --> 1:02:43.520
Foot peg.

1:02:43.560 --> 1:02:45.840
It's broken
the two-stroke oil...

1:02:45.880 --> 1:02:50.000
I'm really sorry you won't
be able to ride it around
tonight. That's a shame.

1:02:54.120 --> 1:02:56.280
Going right.

1:02:56.320 --> 1:02:58.400
(JEREMY CHUCKLING)

1:02:58.440 --> 1:03:00.160
Going left.

Everything is working well.

1:03:02.960 --> 1:03:04.360
(RATTLING)

1:03:06.920 --> 1:03:09.080
Quite rattly, I admit.

1:03:16.280 --> 1:03:17.960
Uuurrhhh...

1:03:18.000 --> 1:03:20.520
That's the collapsed
rear suspension.

1:03:26.560 --> 1:03:28.960
the going wasn't getting
any smoother.

Jesus!

1:03:39.480 --> 1:03:42.800
Hammond, stop!
My pub's exploded.

1:03:45.280 --> 1:03:47.240
Oh, no!

1:03:50.520 --> 1:03:52.240
-Oh, jeez.
-Ha!

1:03:52.280 --> 1:03:54.720
Your one pleasure has been
taken away from you.

1:03:54.760 --> 1:03:57.800
-That's my warm brown beer.
-Gone!

1:03:57.840 --> 1:04:00.600
-Oh, God.
-Is the gin OK?

1:04:00.640 --> 1:04:02.560
-Yes.
-Ha-ha-ha!

1:04:02.600 --> 1:04:06.880
Do you know my pub?
You're barred.

1:04:06.920 --> 1:04:10.200
JAMES:
Figuring there was nothing
important left to break...

1:04:10.240 --> 1:04:12.880

1:04:17.120 --> 1:04:19.200
(SMASHING)

1:04:19.240 --> 1:04:21.520
Hammond,
my windscreen's falling out.

1:04:21.560 --> 1:04:23.560
It's fallen... It's broken.

1:04:30.000 --> 1:04:32.080
Oh, dear.

1:04:32.120 --> 1:04:35.680
You know you're gonna
have to take the rest of it
out, don't you?

1:04:35.720 --> 1:04:38.000
Well, you are. You can't...

1:04:38.040 --> 1:04:41.160
I mean, that's not...
advisable, is it?

1:04:42.280 --> 1:04:45.240
No. Thank you for your input.

1:04:49.720 --> 1:04:51.400
What I've done,
is I've taken out

1:04:51.440 --> 1:04:53.080
the good half
of the windscreen

1:04:53.120 --> 1:04:55.440
before it falls out
and gets broken,

1:04:55.480 --> 1:04:57.520
and I've stowed that
in the back

1:04:57.560 --> 1:05:00.040
until I get somewhere
where I can do
a proper repair.

1:05:00.080 --> 1:05:02.680
And then
I've borrowed Hammond's
motorcycle goggles,

1:05:02.720 --> 1:05:04.360
cos he doesn't
need them any more.

1:05:07.560 --> 1:05:11.920
Eventually, all three of us
were reunited
at our destination...

1:05:13.440 --> 1:05:15.360
...Red Lake.

1:05:18.680 --> 1:05:22.920
Any problems to report,
apart from the fact most of
your RV's missing, May?

1:05:22.960 --> 1:05:25.760
No, everything's fine.
The air conditioning's
excellent.

1:05:29.880 --> 1:05:32.120
What an astonishing lake
this is.

1:05:34.880 --> 1:05:37.960
There must have been global
warming in the olden days

1:05:38.000 --> 1:05:41.200
to have created this
astonishing spectacle.

1:05:43.000 --> 1:05:46.160
What caused the global
warming back then, I wonder?

1:05:48.560 --> 1:05:51.160
This is like a scene
out of Independence Day.

1:05:51.200 --> 1:05:54.320
Jeff Goldblum, Will Smith,
that drunk man.

1:05:55.720 --> 1:05:57.960
Yeah, that's pretty much us.

1:05:58.000 --> 1:06:00.840
Hammond, did you do that
on the back of May's?

1:06:00.880 --> 1:06:02.600
RICHARD: Yes, I did.

1:06:02.640 --> 1:06:04.600
A pub needs a name and a sign

1:06:04.640 --> 1:06:07.240
and I've combined it
with the landlord's name.

1:06:07.280 --> 1:06:10.400
-(CHUCKLES)
-Love your work.

1:06:10.440 --> 1:06:13.600

tell him, but...

my radio's on the seat
down there

1:06:25.720 --> 1:06:27.880
and it would be
irresponsible to take
my hand off the wheel.

1:06:27.920 --> 1:06:31.800
Before I tell him about that,
I'll help him along with it
a bit. Here we go.

with his brakes,
cos he can't stop

1:06:44.680 --> 1:06:47.560
and keeps hitting
the back of the jet ski.

Oh! Oh, dear, oh, dear.

so well on sand.

like mad to avoid it.

1:07:14.000 --> 1:07:15.600
It's a good job
I was behind you.

1:07:15.640 --> 1:07:17.040
If there was nobody
to see that,

1:07:17.080 --> 1:07:19.440
you could have
dragged that for 50 miles.

1:07:19.480 --> 1:07:22.240
-How long have I
been dragging it for?
-20, 30 feet.

1:07:22.280 --> 1:07:25.280
James, I can see
where it fell off.

1:07:26.800 --> 1:07:29.280
And I'm gonna guess
that's three miles ago.

1:11:56.080 --> 1:11:58.320
-Er...who's the idiot?
-"Thank you, rescuers."

1:11:58.320 --> 1:12:00.000
-"Who's the idiot?"
-You are.

1:12:00.040 --> 1:12:03.280
Why did this happen?
There was nothing wrong
with mine or his.

1:12:03.320 --> 1:12:05.080
What do you mean there's
nothing wrong with yours?

1:12:05.120 --> 1:12:07.440
-You've got no windscreen.
-I know,
but it was driving OK.

1:12:07.520 --> 1:12:10.520
I was in control of it.
I was behind the wheel,
I could use the pedals.

1:12:10.560 --> 1:12:12.080
-I was in control of--
-No, you weren't.

1:12:12.120 --> 1:12:14.040
-Of the steering I was.
-Well, that's brilliant.

1:12:14.080 --> 1:12:16.840
We've saved you from
being dashed to death
on a distant mountain.

1:12:16.880 --> 1:12:19.000
-I can't get out.
-And this is the gratitude
we get.

1:12:19.040 --> 1:12:21.840
I was prepared to drive
round in circles
till it ran out of petrol.

1:12:21.880 --> 1:12:24.800
-What's the matter?
-I can't get out.
I've got stuck.

1:12:24.840 --> 1:12:27.840
-This was a mistake.

JAMES: What's he done?
RICHARD: This... I can't...

1:12:31.520 --> 1:12:34.080
-What were you thinking of?
-My legs are on the glass.

1:12:35.600 --> 1:12:37.960
This is a ridiculous day.

1:12:38.000 --> 1:12:41.440
Let's see what can be done
to rescue this situation.

1:12:41.520 --> 1:12:42.880
Well, that's
an interesting one, isn't it?

1:12:42.920 --> 1:12:45.120
Well, let's have
a sit down and think.

1:12:45.160 --> 1:12:48.320
-Yeah, there's a sofa here.
-My knees are stuck on
the window, it's very sore.

1:12:48.360 --> 1:12:51.040
How did you manage that?
Why didn't you go through
legs first?

1:12:51.080 --> 1:12:52.760
I couldn't
because it's higher.

1:12:52.800 --> 1:12:54.680
-But didn't you take
a bar stool with you?
-Aargh!

1:12:54.720 --> 1:12:57.280
Can I just say this holiday
is not working out.

1:12:57.320 --> 1:13:01.680
-No.
-Why don't we just
face facts?

1:13:01.720 --> 1:13:04.320
-RVs are not good.
-They're not good.

1:13:04.360 --> 1:13:07.080
So why don't we
just have a demolition derby?

1:13:07.120 --> 1:13:08.760
-Well, no, wait a minute.
-What?

1:13:08.800 --> 1:13:10.800
That's not a bad idea, cos
half of mine's gone already.

1:13:10.840 --> 1:13:13.080
Yes, mine's pretty much
ruined, cos he's
broken the window.

1:13:13.120 --> 1:13:14.680
Yes, but mine's intact,
it's perfectly intact.

1:13:14.720 --> 1:13:17.240
Nothing has
gone wrong with it.
I'm not destroying it.

1:13:17.280 --> 1:13:19.080
Well, you'll win, then.
You stand more
chance of winning.

1:13:19.120 --> 1:13:21.520
I'll tell you what,
we'll have a vote.

1:13:32.360 --> 1:13:34.640
Right, we've found
three other people

1:13:34.680 --> 1:13:37.880
who are equally disillusioned
with their RVs

1:13:37.920 --> 1:13:39.320
and the rules
are very simple.

1:13:39.320 --> 1:13:43.160
The last one still running
is the winner.

1:13:43.200 --> 1:13:46.640
Once we'd climbed aboard
our race-modified RVs,

1:13:46.680 --> 1:13:49.160
we were ready for the off.

1:13:49.200 --> 1:13:52.040
This is a stupid idea.
I disapprove.

1:13:52.080 --> 1:13:55.000
It's needlessly destructive
and I really like
my little truck.

1:13:56.560 --> 1:13:58.680
Here's my start line
strategy.

1:13:58.720 --> 1:14:01.840
Light goes green.
Hard right! Hit James.

1:14:01.880 --> 1:14:04.120
I want him to be
a bonnet emblem

1:14:04.160 --> 1:14:06.320
by the time I get to
the first corner.

1:14:06.360 --> 1:14:09.280
He doesn't realise that the
window's fallen out of his RV

1:14:09.320 --> 1:14:11.280
and I can hear
everything he's saying.

That's one done.

1:14:40.200 --> 1:14:42.960
Obviously I'm not driving
on the roof.

1:14:43.000 --> 1:14:44.960
I think that would be unwise.

Closing up on the lavatory.

about one of those Americans.

that if you must have an RV

suggest just over there.

-Well, you have,
cos he was driving that.

-And now he won't be
following us any more
