Hi, I'm Rory Reid.
Welcome to Extra Gear.

00:03.800 --> 00:05.959
Each week, dishing up
another helping of Top Gear

00:05.960 --> 00:07.039
as only Extra Gear can.

00:07.040 --> 00:09.919
Tonight, one of my car dreams
becomes a reality

00:09.920 --> 00:12.359
in the form of
a Lamborghini Countach.

00:12.360 --> 00:15.759
For many,
this is the ultimate pin-up.

00:15.760 --> 00:18.319
Chris takes the Porsche GT3
around the Top Gear test track.

00:18.320 --> 00:20.919
It's difficult to describe
how exciting it is.

00:20.920 --> 00:23.240
It's just extraordinarily good!

00:24.560 --> 00:27.959
And I'm joined here in the studio
by car journalist Alex Kersten

00:27.960 --> 00:31.799
and professional race engineer
Mark Wynne. That's right.

00:31.800 --> 00:33.439
This is Extra Gear.

00:35.000 --> 00:41.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:56.640 --> 00:59.919
OK, I want to get my guests out.
We've got a lot to talk about.

00:59.920 --> 01:02.359
He's the face of Car Throttle
which just happens to be

01:02.360 --> 01:04.998
one of the biggest
car channels on YouTube

01:05.000 --> 01:08.239
and he has an MX-5 named Phil.
Please welcome Alex Kersten!

01:08.240 --> 01:09.639
Yay!

01:16.040 --> 01:20.399
It's safe to say my next guest is a
true GT endurance racing specialist.

01:20.400 --> 01:23.079
His accolades include wins
at Sepang 12 Hours,

01:23.080 --> 01:28.119
the GT Asian Series and the British
GT Championship, to name but a few.

01:28.120 --> 01:31.799
Please welcome race engineer
Mark Wynne.

01:39.840 --> 01:43.639
So, in tonight's Top Gear,
Matt was lucky enough to test

01:43.640 --> 01:45.839
the Ferrari 812 Superfast.

01:45.840 --> 01:48.439
Alex, what do you think of
Ferrari's latest offering?

01:48.440 --> 01:50.599
I mean, it's an awesome bit of kit,
isn't it?

01:50.600 --> 01:54.439
We've got 800 horsepower,
naturally aspirated V12,

01:54.440 --> 01:56.199
looks incredible,
sounds the nuts.

01:56.200 --> 01:59.359
It's a car that I'm desperate
to drive, but I haven't done yet.

01:59.360 --> 02:03.759
And Mark, this is the most powerful,
naturally aspirated V12

02:03.760 --> 02:05.239
ever put into a production road car.

02:05.240 --> 02:08.519
And it's the 70th anniversary
of Ferrari.

02:08.520 --> 02:11.759
It's kind of a fitting swansong,
isn't it? What are your thoughts?

02:11.760 --> 02:13.679
I think it's almost exactly that,
you know,

02:13.680 --> 02:16.959
in the age of hybrid technology
and what's going on with Formula 1

02:16.960 --> 02:19.479
this could well be
the end of the V12 in that guise.

02:19.480 --> 02:23.039
Yeah, absolutely. Were you
a fan of supercars as a kid?

02:23.040 --> 02:26.519
I'll be honest,
I prefer shitboxes!

02:28.080 --> 02:30.799
I remember on my bedroom wall
I didn't have a picture of

02:30.800 --> 02:35.319
a Countach or anything like that.
I had a picture of an E30 M3,

02:35.320 --> 02:38.159
and it was one of those weird
toony art things. It was bright red.

02:38.160 --> 02:40.239
And I used to look at that in the
morning

02:40.240 --> 02:41.999
and I would think, "One day..."

02:42.000 --> 02:44.719
I left it too late,
cos I can't afford it now!

02:44.720 --> 02:47.679
Mark, I mean, I had loads of posters
on my wall of supercars.

02:47.680 --> 02:49.719
You must have had something fancy
on your wall.

02:49.720 --> 02:53.719
For me, it was race cars. It was
Le Mans, it was the 962, 956,

02:53.720 --> 02:58.399
cars like that. You know, it wasn't
so much '80s big supercars.

02:58.400 --> 03:00.879
It was more technical than that.

03:00.880 --> 03:04.599
Well, speaking of supercars, there
was one very special Italian pin-up

03:04.600 --> 03:06.959
that I had always wanted
to get my hands on

03:06.960 --> 03:10.120
and I was lucky enough to have a go.
Let's take a look.

03:24.760 --> 03:28.960
Yes! I am driving
the Lamborghini Countach.

03:30.200 --> 03:32.639
For many,
this is the ultimate pin-up.

03:32.640 --> 03:37.560
Nothing that came before or since
has looked quite like this.

03:39.040 --> 03:43.120
Behind me, I've got
a meaty 4.8-litre V12.

03:44.640 --> 03:48.520
And don't I know it!
This thing just sounds glorious.

03:49.920 --> 03:53.959
I'm not the only one who was keen
to experience this iconic supercar.

03:53.960 --> 03:55.759
Elliot Gleave, aka Example,

03:55.760 --> 04:00.719
is a platinum-selling performer
and songwriter who is supercar mad.

04:00.720 --> 04:02.039
Like me, as a child of the '80s,

04:02.040 --> 04:04.959
he's in love
with the Lamborghini Countach.

04:04.960 --> 04:08.320
So I'm off to meet him to make
his boyhood dreams come true.

04:14.560 --> 04:16.918
Elliot! Easy.
A black Lambo!

04:16.920 --> 04:20.519
Mate, this is pretty impressive.
What a beauty.

04:26.480 --> 04:29.119
It's pretty extreme, isn't it?
You must have had one of these

04:29.120 --> 04:32.079
on your wall as a kid.
Yes, I had... one of these.

04:32.080 --> 04:37.279
I had a Diablo, an F40.
Nice. I think maybe a Lotus Esprit.

04:37.280 --> 04:39.959
I've been lucky enough to drive
a couple or at least sit in them.

04:39.960 --> 04:41.919
I've never even come this close
to one of these.

04:41.920 --> 04:44.599
Did you do that thing as a kid
where you memorised all the stats

04:44.600 --> 04:47.319
and the brake horsepower and
the top speed, all that stuff? Yeah.

04:47.320 --> 04:49.719
I used to try to memorise them
as a kid, just to get a bit more,

04:49.720 --> 04:51.879
you know, bonus points
in the playground at school.

04:51.880 --> 04:54.759
I was pretty rubbish
at all sports.

04:54.760 --> 04:57.439
Rapping and cars.
I just majored in that, really.

04:57.440 --> 05:00.279
Shall we jump in and see what
it's like? Let's get involved.

05:00.280 --> 05:02.919
When you're over six foot,
it's like a bum-in swivel.

05:02.920 --> 05:05.680
See if you can get in.
OK! Ha!

05:08.240 --> 05:10.799
Wow! Hey!

05:10.800 --> 05:13.999
Was that intentional?
Totally!

05:22.160 --> 05:23.520
Woo!

05:27.160 --> 05:29.679
So once you made it big and had
a bit of cash, what did you go for?

05:29.680 --> 05:37.639
Along the way I had an R8 and a 355,
I had a Cayman GT4. Yeah.

05:37.640 --> 05:42.999
Um. And then I got a Murcielago
LP640. Got the Murcie. The Murcie.

05:43.000 --> 05:46.279
So, what made you get a Lamborghini
in the first place?

05:46.280 --> 05:48.239
I think I always
just wanted a Lamborghini.

05:48.240 --> 05:53.279
I think this... There's a certain
mystique surrounding a Lamborghini.

05:53.280 --> 05:57.200
It's just that next level of
outrageousness and stupidity. Yeah.

06:01.200 --> 06:03.439
So, what is this like to drive,
then? I mean, it's...

06:03.440 --> 06:06.199
Sticky clutch, heavy clutch?
It's hard work.

06:06.200 --> 06:10.319
It's physical, that's what it is.
The clutch is really, really hard.

06:10.320 --> 06:12.999
I mean, I did leg day yesterday
and I'm having trouble, like,

06:13.000 --> 06:14.919
sticking it down.

06:14.920 --> 06:17.799
The steering's really hard.
There's no power-assisted steering.

06:17.800 --> 06:20.999
Everything feels
just really difficult.

06:21.000 --> 06:23.519
But I like that. It's kind of
a throwback to when

06:23.520 --> 06:25.280
supercars were supercars.

06:29.200 --> 06:32.639
If you go around the corner and you
apply a little bit too much power...

06:32.640 --> 06:34.719
Spin out.
..you're going to spin out. OK.

06:34.720 --> 06:38.159
So this is one of those cars when
you're in charge 100% of the time.

06:38.160 --> 06:42.199
And if you mess up, half-a-million
quid down the drain. Ha-ha!

06:42.200 --> 06:44.919
Do you want to have a go?

06:44.920 --> 06:46.240
We're off!

06:48.560 --> 06:50.159
All right, let's go.

06:51.640 --> 06:54.039
There we go. Right, we're going,
we're going, we're going!

06:54.040 --> 06:55.959
Power, power, power, power.
All right, cool.

06:55.960 --> 06:58.479
You might have your handbrake on.
There we go! Ha!

06:58.480 --> 07:00.199
No wonder.

07:00.200 --> 07:03.079
There we go. Yeah! Ha!

07:03.080 --> 07:04.439
I noticed your legs are kind of

07:04.440 --> 07:06.919
halfway up the steering wheel
as well. It's difficult.

07:06.920 --> 07:10.359
Look at that! Where the clutch
finishes, it's up here.

07:10.360 --> 07:14.079
They're built for little Italian
men, aren't they? Absolutely.

07:18.280 --> 07:21.119
OK, so you had this on your wall.

07:21.120 --> 07:23.279
You knew the facts,
the statistics.

07:23.280 --> 07:25.999
How about a little quiz?
Go on, then. I'll start easy.

07:26.000 --> 07:28.759
Let's start, um, engine size.

07:28.760 --> 07:32.199
4.8-litre V12.
Yep. Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.

07:32.200 --> 07:33.799
Let's go straight to power.

07:33.800 --> 07:37.359
So, this is what, like, 380?

07:37.360 --> 07:38.479
The man knows his stuff.

07:38.480 --> 07:43.159
OK, 0-60? So, what's this? Late
'70s, early '80s. Early '80s, '83.

07:43.160 --> 07:45.159
I'm going to go for 5.4.

07:45.160 --> 07:47.599
5.6, to be precise.
OK. Argh!

07:47.600 --> 07:51.279
Final question now. OK. If you get
this... Do I win the car?

07:51.280 --> 07:53.879
You win a ride home.

07:53.880 --> 07:57.759
OK. Let's go with
what does Countach actually mean?

07:57.760 --> 08:01.319
OK. I know this because nearly
everything to do with a Lambo,

08:01.320 --> 08:05.519
all of the models were named after
something to do with bull-fighting.

08:05.520 --> 08:08.319
Yep, yep. And this was one
of the only ones that wasn't. Yes.

08:08.320 --> 08:11.279
And this,
in the local Italian dialect,

08:11.280 --> 08:14.359
means like "wow" or something.

08:14.360 --> 08:16.039
That's exactly it. Yeah.

08:16.040 --> 08:19.439
It's basically
an Italian exclamation of "wow".

08:19.440 --> 08:22.199
If this was made in south London,
it would be like "rargh"!

08:22.200 --> 08:24.960
The Lamborghini Rargh!

08:33.600 --> 08:35.999
It doesn't really feel like
many of the things I've driven.

08:36.000 --> 08:38.839
It still has its own character.
It's such a quirky design.

08:38.840 --> 08:42.159
Everywhere you look, it's all
angles, isn't it? It's amazing.

08:42.159 --> 08:44.559
It's like they designed this car
using only a ruler.

08:52.360 --> 08:54.799
It feels good to be
in the dream car.

08:54.800 --> 08:56.399
That younger me now is giggling.

08:56.400 --> 08:59.159
I can't thank you enough
for allowing me

08:59.160 --> 09:02.319
to drive one of my childhood dreams.

09:02.320 --> 09:06.199
But my knees are not enjoying it.
OK. All right.

09:06.200 --> 09:08.679
Well, if I'm honest, I'm a little
bit worried by the fact that

09:08.680 --> 09:11.159
one of your feet covers both
the accelerator and the brakes!

09:11.160 --> 09:13.279
If you wouldn't mind
just pulling in.

09:19.080 --> 09:21.679
You know, they say
never meet your heroes

09:21.680 --> 09:23.999
but I couldn't disagree more.
That was...

09:24.000 --> 09:25.719
It was an intense experience.

09:25.720 --> 09:27.959
I love that thing.
What do you think of the Countach?

09:27.960 --> 09:32.879
For me, it is the '80s, isn't it?
It's the shoulder pads of cars.

09:32.880 --> 09:36.479
It's big, it's brash
and it's, like you,

09:36.480 --> 09:39.359
it's a car that I really,
really want to drive.

09:39.360 --> 09:41.839
I don't care that I will die
when I drive it!

09:41.840 --> 09:44.799
It will be fine. I can die happy.

09:44.800 --> 09:47.799
But I'm sure you've got something
to say on that matter, don't you?

09:47.800 --> 09:50.439
It's not for me, no, it's not for
me. What's wrong with you?

09:50.440 --> 09:53.199
I think it's making excuses
for certain things.

09:53.200 --> 09:55.719
It's all mouth and no trousers,
isn't it? Really?

09:55.720 --> 09:57.719
Well, I mean,
there's a lot of mouth.

09:57.720 --> 10:00.159
Who needs trousers
when you've got a mouth like that?

10:00.160 --> 10:01.879
That's your mantra, isn't it?

10:03.240 --> 10:05.479
Is it the big engine thing
that you're not a fan of?

10:05.480 --> 10:07.679
There's nothing wrong
with the big engine.

10:07.680 --> 10:10.359
It just hasn't got the rest of the
package to go with it. Fair play.

10:10.360 --> 10:11.999
Which brings me back
to the Superfast.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.199
Ferrari said that
this will be the very last

10:14.200 --> 10:16.839
naturally aspirated V12
that they produce.

10:16.840 --> 10:21.199
Alex, I know you've driven
naturally aspirated Ferraris

10:21.200 --> 10:25.599
in the past. The latest one
was a GTC... 4Lusso, right, yeah.

10:25.600 --> 10:28.119
What was your experience
with that car?

10:28.120 --> 10:32.319
Man, that was epic. There's nothing
like a six-point-something,

10:32.320 --> 10:34.359
I can't even remember
how big the engine is,

10:34.360 --> 10:36.599
six-point-something V12,
670 horsepower,

10:36.600 --> 10:39.079
all-wheel-drive,
rear-wheel steering.

10:39.080 --> 10:42.359
It's... The way it gets to 60-70
miles an hour,

10:42.360 --> 10:45.319
even in snowy conditions,
is incredible.

10:45.320 --> 10:47.039
The noise is beautiful.

10:47.040 --> 10:49.279
But the best thing is,
you lift up the bonnet

10:49.280 --> 10:52.759
and you just see the Prancing Horse
there, a whacking great big engine,

10:52.760 --> 10:55.919
and yeah, it just stirs up
probably more emotions

10:55.920 --> 10:58.799
than it does in you! I'm sure.

10:58.800 --> 11:01.519
And, Mark, is it the end of an era?
Are we sad to see V12s

11:01.520 --> 11:04.279
go the way of the dinosaur?
For sure. Yeah, I mean,

11:04.280 --> 11:07.759
despite what I've said,
there's a lot of heritage

11:07.760 --> 11:09.919
that comes with Ferrari
with the V12.

11:09.920 --> 11:11.959
Everything the brand stands for,

11:11.960 --> 11:15.159
it will lose a certain mystique when
that falls off the bottom, for sure.

11:15.160 --> 11:17.359
Well, we've got stuff
to look forward to, though,

11:17.360 --> 11:20.199
because they're thinking about,
not turbo-charging,

11:20.200 --> 11:22.399
but going down the route of
hybridisation

11:22.400 --> 11:24.759
and filling in torque holes
with the electric motor.

11:24.760 --> 11:27.679
That's something we can all
appreciate, surely.

11:27.680 --> 11:30.639
Yeah, for sure. And I think once
you've felt that in a car

11:30.640 --> 11:33.279
you'll understand more
why it's driven in that way.

11:33.280 --> 11:35.599
It's very easy to say,
I need to hear it, this and that.

11:35.600 --> 11:38.319
But when you've actually experienced
the torque and the feeling

11:38.320 --> 11:41.999
that can come from that, I think
people convert quite quickly.

11:42.000 --> 11:46.439
OK, so the Camaro ZL1 1LE, it's
a muscle car that has downforce.

11:46.440 --> 11:49.279
And those are words that are not
normally found in the same sentence.

11:49.280 --> 11:51.519
And I was lucky enough
to go to California

11:51.520 --> 11:54.920
and drive one at Willow Springs
racetrack. Let's take another look.

11:57.160 --> 11:58.680
Yeah!

11:59.960 --> 12:04.039
This is a muscle car
with brains beneath the brawn.

12:04.040 --> 12:08.759
Those evil-looking wings and fins
actually work

12:08.760 --> 12:11.999
creating very un-muscle car-y
downforce.

12:12.000 --> 12:18.880
This is the most track-focused
Camaro in 50 years of Camaros.

12:21.760 --> 12:26.399
From a standing start,
a car of this calibre will lap

12:26.400 --> 12:28.799
the two-and-a-half mile
Willow Springs track

12:28.800 --> 12:32.399
in less than one minute 40 seconds.

12:34.680 --> 12:36.879
This already feels good.

12:36.880 --> 12:39.560
All of the power, all of the noise!

12:42.640 --> 12:45.559
That... That was nice!

12:45.560 --> 12:47.359
All right, hit me. How did I do?

12:47.360 --> 12:50.759
That was 1:51.10.

12:50.760 --> 12:52.240
What?

12:53.920 --> 12:57.279
So, to do the 1LE
any kind of justice at all,

12:57.280 --> 13:01.039
I had a rather substantial
11 seconds to find.

13:01.040 --> 13:03.359
Sabine! Hi.
I think there's some work to do.

13:03.360 --> 13:04.440
Go!

13:06.640 --> 13:08.559
I'm not scared.

13:08.560 --> 13:12.200
Scare me! Scare you?
Scare me! I'm trying!

13:14.880 --> 13:16.400
Go! Argh!

13:21.120 --> 13:23.559
143. This is rubbish!

13:23.560 --> 13:26.559
I came all the way from Germany
for that *** time?

13:26.560 --> 13:28.160
We go again.

13:29.320 --> 13:32.559
My grandma would be
much faster than you.

13:32.560 --> 13:34.719
Push! I'm pushing!

13:40.800 --> 13:43.719
I want you to push.
We almost died there.

13:43.720 --> 13:46.999
Eat my dust -
that's what we want to see.

13:47.000 --> 13:49.439
This woman is crazy.

13:49.440 --> 13:51.720
Power!
Come on!

13:54.680 --> 13:56.920
Come on!

13:59.640 --> 14:02.519
Three, two, one...

14:02.520 --> 14:04.199
Yes! Woo!

14:04.200 --> 14:07.159
Yeah! Got it!

14:10.440 --> 14:12.519
Love Sabine.

14:12.520 --> 14:14.919
Love Sabine,
and I love muscle cars.

14:14.920 --> 14:18.759
I also love the fact that the
1LE is a muscle car with downforce.

14:18.760 --> 14:22.039
As a race engineer, Mark,
can you kind of explain to us

14:22.040 --> 14:25.039
what it is that the 1LE package
is doing to the Camaro

14:25.040 --> 14:28.079
to help it go quicker? Yeah. Clearly
they've done a lot of work to

14:28.080 --> 14:31.319
get away some of the inherent
problems, with such a heavy engine.

14:31.320 --> 14:34.759
You can see a lot of work
they've done around the front end -

14:34.760 --> 14:37.439
the dive planes, the tyres
on the front are huge,

14:37.440 --> 14:41.319
it's got 305 tyres on it,
which is substantial.

14:41.320 --> 14:45.639
Interestingly to me, with regards
to the downforce that they quote,

14:45.640 --> 14:47.359
I think a lot of the aero work
has been done

14:47.360 --> 14:49.359
more to affect
the balance of the car,

14:49.360 --> 14:52.199
to make the front work,
rather than give overall grip.

14:52.200 --> 14:55.359
It's a feeling of confidence you
must have felt when you drove it.

14:55.360 --> 14:57.639
I wasn't confident at all!

14:57.640 --> 14:59.479
I was scared. I was scared to hell.

14:59.480 --> 15:01.759
Just trying to do you a favour!

15:03.240 --> 15:05.639
It's got quite advanced dampers
on there.

15:05.640 --> 15:07.679
It's got what they call
the SSV dampers

15:07.680 --> 15:10.839
which is something that has been
in racing for the last ten years

15:10.840 --> 15:14.919
which, obviously, go towards
making those tyres,

15:14.920 --> 15:18.719
which are special for the car, the
Michelin tyres, work as a package.

15:18.720 --> 15:21.519
But exactly how much lap time
can you shave off

15:21.520 --> 15:23.439
with such an advanced package?

15:23.440 --> 15:25.839
It depends on the driver,
doesn't it?

15:25.840 --> 15:27.199
Say me, for example.

15:28.560 --> 15:32.479
Yeah, a decent day's work should be
10-12 seconds, you would think,

15:32.480 --> 15:35.719
if you can learn to drive it.
Which is roughly what I got down to.

15:35.720 --> 15:36.879
Exactly.

15:36.880 --> 15:38.319
Alex, have you ever driven this?

15:38.320 --> 15:43.159
I have not. No. I don't really
have many desires to drive it.

15:43.160 --> 15:46.879
I like cars, as you know,
that I can drive at ten-tenths.

15:46.880 --> 15:49.759
And as we found out,
you couldn't drive it at ten-tenths.

15:49.760 --> 15:52.159
So there's not much hope
of me doing the same.

15:52.160 --> 15:53.999
And I don't have
a shouty German next to me!

15:55.520 --> 15:57.959
So, I like... I prefer lightweight.

15:57.960 --> 16:00.759
I prefer, obviously,
rear-wheel drive, too.

16:00.760 --> 16:03.599
But that, for me, is just too much.

16:03.600 --> 16:07.039
As you saw in the film, I needed to
shave 11 seconds off my lap time.

16:07.040 --> 16:10.199
Mark, as an engineer,
how do you work with a driver

16:10.200 --> 16:12.959
to get them to go even faster
than they would normally?

16:12.960 --> 16:15.959
It depends whether you're working
with an amateur or with a pro,

16:15.960 --> 16:18.679
but the three main... A pro!
With a pro, sorry, yeah, of course!

16:18.680 --> 16:21.839
The three main tools we have are
the data that comes from the car,

16:21.840 --> 16:24.599
video overlays, and occasionally,

16:24.600 --> 16:27.079
before the circuit,
go into a simulator.

16:27.080 --> 16:30.199
One of the main things you need to
do is make the driver feel confident

16:30.200 --> 16:32.039
that he can do
what I'm telling him to do.

16:32.040 --> 16:36.639
Do you agree with her approach? Is
there some merit in the tough love?

16:36.640 --> 16:38.119
Again, it depends on the driver.

16:38.120 --> 16:40.799
Sometimes you have to give them
a bit of a smack, but generally...

16:42.280 --> 16:43.639
..it's more of a cuddle.

16:43.640 --> 16:46.839
You've got to work with this guy
for the minimum of a weekend,

16:46.840 --> 16:48.199
normally one year plus.

16:48.200 --> 16:50.839
The key thing for me
was overcoming my fear.

16:50.840 --> 16:52.439
Because I can drive quickly

16:52.440 --> 16:55.359
but I can't necessarily drive
at the speed of a racing driver

16:55.360 --> 16:59.239
and take on broad feedback
from an engineer at the same time.

16:59.240 --> 17:02.079
What do you do when a driver
thinks he knows best

17:02.080 --> 17:03.719
and doesn't listen to you?

17:03.720 --> 17:06.159
Let him make a mistake or two.
You know.

17:06.160 --> 17:08.839
It's a lot easier to learn
from your mistakes

17:08.839 --> 17:11.719
than it is to be told something
you don't believe in.

17:11.720 --> 17:14.039
Also, one of
the key relationships is

17:14.040 --> 17:16.118
the confidence
the driver's got in you.

17:16.119 --> 17:19.638
And if you say, "Look,
if you do this, this happens,"

17:19.640 --> 17:20.959
and it actually happens,

17:20.960 --> 17:23.439
then you short-circuit
a lot of work going forward.

17:23.440 --> 17:25.719
Because if you say, "Do this,"
he then does it

17:25.720 --> 17:28.839
or she does it, you know.
Yeah. It's about that relationship

17:28.840 --> 17:30.999
that really gets the results.
Absolutely.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.679
When you saw me come off
the track there in the dirt,

17:33.680 --> 17:36.479
that was one of the key moments
for me because I realised,

17:36.480 --> 17:39.039
yes, I'm going faster,
but maybe I'm going too fast

17:39.040 --> 17:42.759
and it's a difficult balancing act
to kind of push yourself

17:42.760 --> 17:45.679
and get to the point
where you're afraid.

17:45.680 --> 17:47.639
But that when you know
you're winning, isn't it?

17:47.640 --> 17:50.599
OK, so, the 1LE was actually
benchmarked in Sabine's backyard

17:50.600 --> 17:53.520
at the Nurburgring.
And I think we have a clip.

18:41.280 --> 18:43.199
Serious skills.

18:43.200 --> 18:45.879
Now, that managed 7:16.

18:45.880 --> 18:47.879
That's something for Chevy
to be very proud of.

18:47.880 --> 18:51.959
It makes the 1LE
the 14th-fastest production car

18:51.960 --> 18:54.359
ever at the Nurburgring.

18:54.360 --> 18:58.839
To put it into perspective, that's
faster than a Ferrari 488 GTB.

18:58.840 --> 19:01.639
So although this car isn't actually
allowed to be bought in Europe,

19:01.640 --> 19:03.559
it came over to Europe,
showed us how it's done

19:03.560 --> 19:06.479
and then went back to America. Just
to prove a point, yeah. Incredible.

19:06.480 --> 19:09.039
Alex, have you ever driven
at the Nurburgring? Yeah.

19:09.040 --> 19:10.679
I've driven at the Nurburgring.

19:10.680 --> 19:12.559
I have a Mk1 MX-5.

19:12.560 --> 19:15.639
People know me from being obsessed
with my Mk1 MX-5.

19:15.640 --> 19:17.159
His name is Phil, if anyone cares!

19:18.280 --> 19:21.359
Drove it on the Nurburgring twice,
broke it on the Nurburgring twice.

19:21.360 --> 19:23.879
But no regrets at all.

19:23.880 --> 19:27.199
Nurburgring is a really,
really intimidating place.

19:27.200 --> 19:30.239
And it is a complete car killer.

19:30.240 --> 19:33.519
Imagine if Sabine was driving.
I mean, what, three minutes?

19:33.520 --> 19:35.399
Yeah, at least.
Easy, easy.

19:35.400 --> 19:37.319
OK, well, it's time for
the Harris Hot Lap.

19:37.320 --> 19:39.519
And this week Chris hits
the Top Gear test track

19:39.520 --> 19:43.759
in one of his all-time favourites,
the all-new Porsche GT3.

19:49.360 --> 19:53.599
Listen to that. You'd pay the money
for the engine alone.

19:53.600 --> 19:56.079
It sounds magnificent, doesn't it?

19:56.080 --> 19:58.759
Let's see if we can get it
to rotate 911-style.

19:58.760 --> 20:00.920
Get the arse round, get on the gas.

20:03.720 --> 20:06.199
There it is. What a joy!

20:06.200 --> 20:12.079
So, this is the new GT3.
Four litres now. 500 horsepower.

20:12.080 --> 20:14.559
Loads of torque.

20:14.560 --> 20:16.959
Comparing it to an 812 Superfast.

20:16.960 --> 20:19.839
Well, they're both
normally aspirated

20:19.840 --> 20:24.600
and they're both supposedly the most
usable cars within their range.

20:26.200 --> 20:30.159
I have a sneaking suspicion that,
even though the 812 is wonderful,

20:30.160 --> 20:34.559
this Porsche, which is worth a lot
less money, might provide you with

20:34.560 --> 20:37.519
not far off
the same driving experience.

20:37.520 --> 20:40.759
This engine is revving to 9,000rpm.

20:40.760 --> 20:43.879
I mean, it's difficult to describe
how exciting it is.

20:43.880 --> 20:46.080
It's just extraordinarily good.

20:48.560 --> 20:49.999
Yes.

20:50.000 --> 20:51.880
Ha! I love my job!

20:53.640 --> 20:55.959
Engine is the heart of it, though.

20:55.960 --> 20:59.679
Everyone's gone turbo-charged
and Porsche have given us

20:59.680 --> 21:03.039
this masterpiece.
More torque than the last engine.

21:03.040 --> 21:04.959
Just leaps out of corners now.

21:04.960 --> 21:06.599
Yep. It's the best.

21:06.600 --> 21:08.120
It remains the best.

21:14.640 --> 21:16.279
Great driving as always.

21:16.280 --> 21:18.919
Chris actually raises
a very interesting point.

21:18.920 --> 21:23.199
He says the GT3 might actually
provide the same driving experience

21:23.200 --> 21:27.839
as the much more powerful,
much more expensive 812 Superfast.

21:27.840 --> 21:30.559
But it's always about usable power,
isn't it?

21:30.560 --> 21:33.039
Yes, it's synergy.
You know, there's a synergy between

21:33.040 --> 21:36.159
what the chassis can handle and the
feeling you get from taking a car

21:36.160 --> 21:38.599
to the edge of the envelope.

21:38.600 --> 21:40.919
You know, interestingly
in GT3 racing, the BOP,

21:40.920 --> 21:43.999
which is the balance of performance,
brings most cars back to

21:44.000 --> 21:47.759
around 560, 530 horsepower.
And they do OK with that, you know.

21:47.760 --> 21:51.319
There are very few race cars
that go over 800 horsepower.

21:51.320 --> 21:53.519
Well, I can't think of any
other than Formula 1

21:53.520 --> 21:54.839
and maybe the Le Mans cars.

21:54.840 --> 21:56.599
And, Alex, what do you think?
Do you agree?

21:56.600 --> 21:58.879
Do you think that less power
is more enjoyable?

21:58.880 --> 22:01.599
Yeah, I mean, especially
in the case of these two,

22:01.600 --> 22:04.999
I would wholeheartedly
go for the Porsche.

22:05.000 --> 22:07.959
Don't forget,
it's also going to be lighter.

22:07.960 --> 22:12.239
And the great thing about
the Porsche is that

22:12.240 --> 22:14.159
it's one of those cars that,
you know,

22:14.160 --> 22:16.519
you're talking about
overcoming your fear,

22:16.520 --> 22:19.599
it's one of those cars that it would
be easy to overcome your fear

22:19.600 --> 22:22.839
and try and get to that ten-tenths
level of what the car is capable of,

22:22.840 --> 22:26.039
and then really figure out,
you know,

22:26.040 --> 22:28.519
how good a driver you are as well.
Whereas with the Ferrari,

22:28.520 --> 22:30.719
I think if you were trying
to get to ten-tenths in that,

22:30.720 --> 22:32.479
you'd long be dead.

22:32.480 --> 22:34.399
By the time you got there
you'd be at 15-tenths.

22:34.400 --> 22:36.479
And then... Yeah, so...

22:36.480 --> 22:38.879
What about pulling up to your mates
in the car park in an 812

22:38.880 --> 22:41.519
with 800 horsepower? Surely
you'd get more street cred.

22:41.520 --> 22:44.559
Is that not important? I don't know.

22:44.560 --> 22:46.799
As a petrolhead, as a car guy,

22:46.800 --> 22:50.479
for me, it's the purity of driving.
You know,

22:50.480 --> 22:53.199
I want to have fun in a car.
I don't want to have to show off.

22:53.200 --> 22:55.959
For me, you know, purity is key,

22:55.960 --> 22:59.039
and something like the Porsche
is more what I'm after.

22:59.040 --> 23:00.719
I don't need 800 horsepower.

23:00.720 --> 23:03.039
You couldn't even
get to 800 horsepower,

23:03.040 --> 23:05.399
the limits of that,
on the autobahn, so...

23:05.400 --> 23:08.519
Just, yeah, stick within the realms
of engineering, I say. Incredible.

23:08.520 --> 23:12.079
Sitting here with two petrolheads
saying the Ferrari is overpowered.

23:12.080 --> 23:15.079
OK, well, I wholeheartedly disagree!

23:15.080 --> 23:17.439
Audience, Porsche or Ferrari?

23:17.440 --> 23:19.599
Porsche. Ferrari.

23:19.600 --> 23:22.359
Ferrari it is! All right.
That's all we've got time for.

23:22.360 --> 23:24.039
Please give a massive thank-you

23:24.040 --> 23:26.039
to our guests Alex Kersten
and Mark Wynne.

23:30.600 --> 23:34.279
Join me next week as Extra Gear
finds a better way

23:34.280 --> 23:36.159
to get around Tokyo traffic.

23:36.160 --> 23:38.919
Chris' skills are put to the test
in a Division 1 Superkart.

23:38.920 --> 23:41.199
And I'll be joined
here in the studio

23:41.200 --> 23:43.519
by Team Citroen WRC driver
Craig Breen,

23:43.520 --> 23:46.639
