-How could you know that?

45:33.264 --> 45:35.732
Because I found their graves.
They were buried here.

45:35.734 --> 45:37.633

the person who dug the graves?

45:38.670 --> 45:40.770

MIA:
You still love that sound?

47:04.022 --> 47:07.623
I guess everyone does.

47:07.625 --> 47:09.892
Don't think I'll be coming
to the beach much after this.

47:12.530 --> 47:15.164
You know, out on the raft,

47:15.166 --> 47:18.835
for the first time in my life,
I thought I was gonna die.

47:18.837 --> 47:24.140
I really thought that...
that that was it.

47:24.142 --> 47:28.477
A-And it's funny because
all I was thinking about

47:28.479 --> 47:31.180
is how embarrassing it would be.

47:31.182 --> 47:35.017
Everyone back home's
just waiting for me to fail.

47:37.622 --> 47:41.557
Out on the raft,

47:41.559 --> 47:43.993
you don't hear waves.

47:43.995 --> 47:45.962
You don't hear anything.

47:51.135 --> 47:55.371
I'd rather die on the raft
than this place.

47:55.373 --> 47:59.442
You don't know
what it's like out there.

48:18.363 --> 48:19.996
So, we're gonna head west.

48:19.998 --> 48:21.998
I saw a bunch of planes
go that way.

48:22.000 --> 48:23.399
I'm pretty sure they'll see us.

48:26.905 --> 48:28.104
Okay, hey.

48:30.775 --> 48:34.076
-I know this all sounds crazy.
-Yeah.

48:35.113 --> 48:37.280
I really need you to believe me.

48:40.051 --> 48:42.919
I do.

48:42.921 --> 48:46.622
It's just a lot
to process, all right?

48:46.624 --> 48:49.458
I mean, we just need
a little bit of time, okay?

48:53.631 --> 48:55.932
I'm gonna get more food.

48:57.735 --> 49:00.636
We should bring
as much as we can.

49:00.638 --> 49:03.539
Can I borrow this?

49:04.809 --> 49:06.442
Thanks.

49:11.916 --> 49:13.950
Hey, make sure she gets ready.

49:32.170 --> 49:35.538

49:59.297 --> 50:01.030
Okay, there's enough for a week.

50:01.032 --> 50:04.100
We got to be smart
with what we have.

50:04.102 --> 50:05.968
All right,
let's load up the raft.

50:05.970 --> 50:07.603
LUCAS:
Jenn.

50:07.605 --> 50:08.571
We're not leaving.

50:11.709 --> 50:13.342
-What?
-Not right now.

50:13.344 --> 50:15.978
-Not in our condition.
-We can't do it.

50:15.980 --> 50:18.647
I understand that you're tired.

50:18.649 --> 50:20.649
Guys, I'm tired, too.
I'm exhausted, but...

50:20.651 --> 50:22.685
We're not just tired.
We're weak.

50:22.687 --> 50:24.453
All right, we've barely eaten.

50:24.455 --> 50:26.822
-Just need to rest up, all
right? -No, you don't rest here.

50:26.824 --> 50:29.959
Jenn, you've been alone
and you're scared,

50:29.961 --> 50:31.527
and I get that.

50:31.529 --> 50:33.729
But whatever you've been seeing,
this animal...

50:33.731 --> 50:36.132
-It's not an animal! I told you
that! -Hey, okay, listen to me,

50:36.134 --> 50:37.533
there's nothing for miles, Jenn.

50:37.535 --> 50:39.668
Okay? I-I say
we light a huge fire.

50:39.670 --> 50:41.504
Y-You said there
are planes, right?

50:41.506 --> 50:44.273
We'll-we'll light a fire
and they'll see us.

50:48.513 --> 50:50.713
(sighs)

50:54.652 --> 50:56.986
It's getting dark.

50:56.988 --> 50:58.254
Get ready to leave.

50:58.256 --> 51:00.089
Sweetheart, are you even
listening to me?

51:00.091 --> 51:02.591
We are not getting
on that fucking raft!

51:08.266 --> 51:10.699
(stammers)

51:10.701 --> 51:13.702
Just not tonight, all right?

51:13.704 --> 51:16.172
We'll figure this out.

51:21.345 --> 51:23.312

Hey!

53:09.620 --> 53:11.353
Stop it!

53:11.355 --> 53:13.389
Stop! Jenn! Wait!

53:13.391 --> 53:15.057
Hey! Stop!

53:15.059 --> 53:16.492
-Get off me!
-Calm down.

53:16.494 --> 53:19.228
-Let go of me! I'm leaving!
-Stop! Stop!

Shh. It's okay.

54:22.226 --> 54:24.059
Where is Lucas?

54:24.061 --> 54:26.295
He's just taking a look around.

54:26.297 --> 54:28.731
Don't worry, it's been dark
for a few hours,

54:28.733 --> 54:31.100
and we haven't seen anything.

54:31.102 --> 54:32.801
You had to tie me up?

54:32.803 --> 54:34.637
I think just for now.

54:34.639 --> 54:36.305
I'm sorry.

54:36.307 --> 54:39.608
Really, I... I shouldn't have
hit you like that.

54:39.610 --> 54:42.811
I just... I didn't know
what else to do.

54:42.813 --> 54:43.912
Yeah, I don't care.

54:43.914 --> 54:45.948
Just...

54:45.950 --> 54:47.383
untie me.

54:49.820 --> 54:51.453
I think we've all been

54:51.455 --> 54:53.389
through something traumatic,

54:53.391 --> 54:55.991
and we're all just trying
to cope with it in our own

54:55.993 --> 54:57.826
different ways.

54:57.828 --> 54:59.561
I'm just as guilty, I am.

54:59.563 --> 55:03.132
Guilty? Who's guilty?

55:03.134 --> 55:05.834
I didn't make this up.

55:05.836 --> 55:07.603
I'm not lying to you.

55:07.605 --> 55:08.837
Right.

55:08.839 --> 55:10.472
Like when you got mugged
before we left.

55:10.474 --> 55:13.175
Jenn, it's not that
I don't believe you.

55:13.177 --> 55:15.411
It's just that, over the years,

55:15.413 --> 55:17.279
you've made it pretty hard
for me to believe you.

55:17.281 --> 55:18.947
(exhales)
This is a little different.

55:18.949 --> 55:20.816
I just want what's best
for everyone.

55:20.818 --> 55:24.119
I really don't need you
to tell me what's best for me.

I didn't see anything.

55:36.367 --> 55:37.866
There's nothing out there.

55:37.868 --> 55:39.868
'Cause it doesn't come
from the trees.

55:39.870 --> 55:41.937
I just want you to feel safe.

55:41.939 --> 55:43.372
MIA: We're all just trying
to figure this out.

55:43.374 --> 55:45.507
Figure it out?

55:45.509 --> 55:47.609
-Yes, figure it out.
-We need to

55:47.611 --> 55:49.778
get away from this place
as soon as possible.

55:51.282 --> 55:53.048
Do you want me to give
you guys a second?

55:53.050 --> 55:54.683
-Okay.
-Thank you.

55:54.685 --> 55:57.219
(footfalls departing)

55:59.290 --> 56:00.989
She's really sorry
about what happened...

56:00.991 --> 56:02.391
Yeah, she mentioned it.

56:02.393 --> 56:04.126
Lucas, untie me.

56:04.128 --> 56:05.894
Not until you promise me
you'll relax.

56:08.165 --> 56:09.465
You all right?

56:14.238 --> 56:16.438
I just want to make sure
that you're okay.

56:20.511 --> 56:22.311
You're fine.

56:32.556 --> 56:35.324
There's always a black cloud
hanging over your head.

56:35.326 --> 56:36.492
You know that, right?

56:36.494 --> 56:39.661
This whole thing, Jenn.

56:39.663 --> 56:41.764
It's so crazy.

56:41.766 --> 56:44.066
I was having a great time
all week.

56:44.068 --> 56:45.334
On a boat with my friends,

56:45.336 --> 56:47.202
weather was perfect.

56:47.204 --> 56:49.671
Brought you
on this incredible trip.

56:49.673 --> 56:54.276
Everyone's having a great time,
except you, right?

56:54.278 --> 56:56.578
And the night you come up
to tell me

56:56.580 --> 56:58.514
that you might not be happy,

56:58.516 --> 57:00.516
that you maybe don't want
to be in this...

57:06.090 --> 57:08.090
...storm clouds roll in.

57:09.593 --> 57:11.927
How perfect is that?

57:11.929 --> 57:14.263
No matter where you go,
there's always a storm

57:14.265 --> 57:15.464
right behind you.

57:15.466 --> 57:18.100
Lucas, you know I love you,

57:18.102 --> 57:21.136
but this is not the time
to talk about this.

57:23.874 --> 57:25.274
Let me go.

57:28.379 --> 57:29.812
So, what were you gonna do?

57:29.814 --> 57:31.880
-What was your plan, exactly?
-I told you.

57:31.882 --> 57:34.783
-Head west.
-No, I get that.

57:34.785 --> 57:37.486
But you head west, you get found

57:37.488 --> 57:39.988
and brought back home.
And then what?

57:42.059 --> 57:43.559
You've got no one else.

57:43.561 --> 57:46.595
Where you gonna live?

57:46.597 --> 57:49.965
You gonna go back to school?

57:49.967 --> 57:51.266
And afford it how?

57:51.268 --> 57:54.837
I pay for your life.

57:54.839 --> 57:58.507
And you pay me back
by taking the raft

57:58.509 --> 58:00.409
and leaving me here
to starve to death?

58:00.411 --> 58:02.344
You don't starve here.

58:02.346 --> 58:04.580
That's not what happens.

58:04.582 --> 58:06.281
You get torn into pieces
and dragged into a hole

58:06.283 --> 58:08.917
in the middle of the ocean.

58:08.919 --> 58:11.086
That's what happens here.

<i> twice as fast in water</i>
<i> as it is on land,</i>

1:10:20.517 --> 1:10:22.850
<i> and it bleeds black blood.</i>

1:10:22.852 --> 1:10:25.420
<i> For a week I've run from it</i>
<i> and hid from it,</i>
