-YES, TELL ME ABOUT IT.

19:43.312 --> 19:45.227
SHAUNI'S BEEN PRETTY
STRESSED OUT LATELY.

19:48.361 --> 19:49.797
-YOU KNOW,

19:49.927 --> 19:52.365
I GOT ENOUGH RECURRENCES
TO HANDLE HIS WEEKEND.

19:52.495 --> 19:54.149
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE HER
ON A BUSMAN'S HOLIDAY?

19:55.368 --> 19:56.412
-A WHAT?

19:57.196 --> 19:59.676
-YOU KNOW,
A BUSMAN'S HOLIDAY.

19:59.807 --> 20:04.768
TAKE HER TO A NICE HOTEL ON
THE BEACH, JUST THE TWO OF YOU,

20:04.899 --> 20:07.380
LOTS OF FUN NO RESPONSIBILITIES.

20:07.510 --> 20:09.730
TRUST ME. IT'LL WORK WONDERS.

20:09.860 --> 20:11.601
-YES, WELL IT SOUNDS GREAT,
MITCH,

20:11.732 --> 20:13.168
BUT YOU KNOW
I CAN'T AFFORD THAT.

20:13.908 --> 20:15.692
-JUST A SUGGESTION.

20:38.324 --> 20:39.803
HEY, ARE YOU OKAY?

20:39.934 --> 20:41.675
YOU OKAY?
WHAT HAPPENED?

20:43.111 --> 20:44.199
HEY, IT'S ALL RIGHT.

20:44.330 --> 20:46.810
IT'S ALL RIGHT. IT'S OKAY.

21:00.824 --> 21:03.958
-I WAS TALKING TO HER ONE
MINUTE BEFORE IT HAPPENED.

21:04.088 --> 21:06.656
I WAS A HUNDRED YARDS
AWAY AND I MISSED IT.

21:06.787 --> 21:09.268
-YOU CAN'T STOP
EVERYTHING BEFORE IT HAPPENS.

21:11.052 --> 21:12.445
-MITCH, WHAT DID GARNER SAY?

21:12.575 --> 21:14.011
-HE SAID HE'D LIKE
FOR US TO BRING HER TO

21:14.142 --> 21:16.623
THE POLICE STATION AS
SOON AS SHE'S UP TO IT.

21:16.753 --> 21:18.886
I'D LIKE TO DRIVE HER,
IF THAT'S OKAY?

21:19.016 --> 21:20.235
-I THINK YOU SHOULD.

21:26.807 --> 21:27.764
-HOW IS SHE?

21:27.895 --> 21:29.288
-SHE'S BATTERED AND SCARED.

21:30.419 --> 21:32.334
-YOU THINK SHE'S UP TO
GIVING THE POLICE A STATEMENT?

21:32.465 --> 21:35.163
-SHE'S
STILL REALLY UPSET.

21:35.294 --> 21:36.817
SHE SAID SHE WANTED TO SEE YOU.

21:38.471 --> 21:39.298
-ME?

21:39.428 --> 21:40.299
-YEAH.

21:41.735 --> 21:43.171
-WHY?

21:43.302 --> 21:45.565
I DON'T KNOW.
WHY DON'T YOU FIND OUT?

21:54.965 --> 21:56.271
I MEAN HE WAS A SURF FISHERMAN.

21:56.402 --> 21:57.664
CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT?

21:58.665 --> 22:00.580
-WAS SHE ABLE TO DESCRIBE HIM?

22:00.710 --> 22:03.974
-YEAH, ABOUT FIVE-TEN, 170.

22:04.105 --> 22:06.977
HE WAS WEARING A BASEBALL
CAP AND MIRRORED GLASSES.

22:07.108 --> 22:09.980
MITCH, I RUN BY GUYS
LIKE THAT ALL THE TIME.

22:10.111 --> 22:11.721
I MEAN THIS COULD'VE
HAPPENED TO ANY ONE OF US,

22:11.852 --> 22:13.767
TO MEGAN, BROOKE, ME.

22:13.897 --> 22:16.030
JUST BE CAREFUL. FROM NOW ON,
NO WORKOUTS ALONE.

22:18.075 --> 22:20.513
-SHE SAID THAT HE HELD
A GUTTING KNIFE TO HER STOMACH,

22:21.340 --> 22:24.081
AND HE TOLD HER, "YOU WON'T
GET A WAY FROM ME TWICE."

22:24.212 --> 22:25.953
-TWICE?
-YEAH,

22:26.910 --> 22:28.521
AND THEN HE LOOKED AT
HER AND HE SAID,

22:28.651 --> 22:30.436
"YOU'RE NOT THE SAME ONE,"
AND HE LET HER GO.

22:32.089 --> 22:34.091
-NOT THE SAME ONE.

22:34.222 --> 22:35.615
-I MEAN WHAT
DOES THAT MEAN?

22:40.489 --> 22:42.926
-I SHOULD HAVE
ENCOURAGED YOU TO RUN WITH ME,

22:44.145 --> 22:45.973
SO I WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN
ALONE WHEN--

22:50.978 --> 22:53.415
SO, WHY DID YOU RUN AWAY?

22:56.418 --> 22:57.941
-I KNOW YOUR REPUTATION.

23:00.161 --> 23:02.685
YOU COME ON TO EVERY
INTERNATIONAL STEWARDESS

23:02.816 --> 23:03.904
IN THEIR NATIVE TONGUES.

23:05.601 --> 23:07.081
THEN MAKE A JOKE OUT OF IT,

23:07.690 --> 23:10.127
SO YOU WON'T BE SO HURT
WHEN YOU'RE REJECTED.

23:12.956 --> 23:14.218
-WHAT ARE
YOU, A PSYCHOLOGIST?

23:15.176 --> 23:18.614
-A STEWARDESS IT
REQUIRES THE SAME SKILLS.

23:22.401 --> 23:25.012
HARVEY, IF YOU WANT ME TO REPORT
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE POLICE...

23:26.666 --> 23:29.408
-OKAY. I'LL TAKE YOU.

23:30.191 --> 23:31.366
WE'LL CATCH THIS GUY.

23:31.497 --> 23:33.194
-I HAVE A
FLIGHT IN TWO HOURS.

23:34.325 --> 23:36.719
I ALREADY TOLD THE OTHER
LIFEGUARD WHAT HAPPENED.

23:38.068 --> 23:39.592
I JUST WANT TO
LEAVE THIS PLACE.

23:39.722 --> 23:42.986
PLEASE, TAKE ME BACK TO MY
APARTMENT SO I CAN PACK.

23:47.774 --> 23:49.297
-ON ONE CONDITION...

23:51.517 --> 23:54.650
THAT YOU PROMISE TO SEE ME
ON YOUR NEXT LAY OVER.

23:58.567 --> 24:00.439
-I'D LIKE THAT.

24:03.398 --> 24:05.574
-AND YOU GO WITH
ME TO SEE THE POLICE.

24:10.318 --> 24:16.324
-ON ONE CONDITION,
THAT YOU MAKE ME
LAUGH AFTERWARDS.

24:19.545 --> 24:20.894
-IT'S A DEAL.

24:33.254 --> 24:35.386
HEY, LET'S GO.

24:35.517 --> 24:36.344
LET'S GET SOMETHING TO EAT.

24:36.475 --> 24:37.345
LET'S GO TO THE HUT.

24:37.476 --> 24:38.389
-I CAN'T.

24:38.520 --> 24:39.782
I GOT TO GO HOME.

24:39.913 --> 24:41.392
MY PARENTS ARE LEAVING
FOR THE WEEKEND.

24:42.089 --> 24:43.003
-THE WHOLE WEEKEND?

24:43.830 --> 24:46.354
-YEAH. THEY BOUGHT A
NEW CONDO IN PALM SPRINGS.

24:46.485 --> 24:49.313
-WELL, THAT'S FANTASTIC.
I'LL COME OVER.

24:49.444 --> 24:50.793
WE'LL HAVE A NICE
WEEKEND TOGETHER,

24:50.924 --> 24:52.534
AND I WON'T FEEL LIKE
A SOCIAL OUTCAST.

24:54.710 --> 24:57.931
-WHAT, WHAT IS IT?
-YOU CAN'T COME OVER.

24:58.671 --> 25:00.194
-WHY? YOU SAID THEY
WERE GOING TO BE GONE.

25:01.108 --> 25:02.588
-I PROMISED
THEM THAT YOU WOULDN'T.

25:04.851 --> 25:07.201
-WAIT A MINUTE. LET ME GET
SOMETHING STRAIGHT HERE.

25:09.638 --> 25:11.031
YOUR PARENTS MADE
IT A POINT TO MAKE

25:11.161 --> 25:12.423
SURE THAT I WOULDN'T COME OVER?

25:13.468 --> 25:14.948
-I'M SORRY.

25:15.078 --> 25:16.558
EDDY, LOOK, AS LONG AS
I LIVE IN THEIR HOUSE,

25:16.689 --> 25:17.951
I GOT TO LIVE BY THEIR RULES.

25:18.081 --> 25:21.563
-THEN MOVE OUT.
-IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE.

25:22.390 --> 25:25.219
LOOK I AM IN A LOUSY MOOD,
AND I'M TIRED.

25:25.828 --> 25:28.004
I WANT TO GO HOME, AND I WANT
TO GET SOME SLEEP, OKAY?

25:34.968 --> 25:35.838
I'LL CALL YOU.

25:35.969 --> 25:37.231
YEAH.

26:39.075 --> 26:43.123
-MITCH? IS THAT YOU

26:45.081 --> 26:48.998
JOHN? WHO'S THERE?

27:44.967 --> 27:46.273
-YEAH, I'M COMING.

27:53.149 --> 27:54.237
MEGAN.

28:02.681 --> 28:04.334
-NO, NOT YET.

28:10.166 --> 28:12.560
-YOU WERE ATTACKED ON THE BEACH
YESTERDAY, WEREN'T YOU?

28:15.911 --> 28:17.130
WAS HE A FISHERMAN?

28:18.566 --> 28:19.785
-HOW DID YOU KNOW?

28:20.873 --> 28:22.701
BECAUSE HE ATTACKED
A GIRL WHO LOOKED

28:22.831 --> 28:24.833
A LITTLE LIKE YOU,
TOO, YESTERDAY.

28:24.964 --> 28:26.313
-PLEASE NO.

28:26.966 --> 28:28.315
-IT'S OKAY.
SHE GOT AWAY.

28:28.445 --> 28:30.099
-THANK GOD.

28:32.711 --> 28:34.713
MAYBE BECAUSE IT WASN'T YOU.

28:36.802 --> 28:41.328
-IT'S BECAUSE I GOT AWAY
AT LEAST I THOUGHT I DID.

28:58.084 --> 28:59.389
-WHY DIDN'T YOU REPORT IT?

29:02.175 --> 29:03.393
-WOULD YOU
BELIEVE THAT REPORTING

29:03.524 --> 29:05.308
IT TERRIFIED ME ALMOST AS MUCH.

29:07.441 --> 29:09.704
DO YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE
TO REPORT A RAPE, MITCH?

29:12.489 --> 29:15.231
-NO.
-WELL, I DO.

29:16.972 --> 29:19.496
AFTER I GOT AWAY FROM HIM
WHEN I WAS TREADING WATER,

29:20.759 --> 29:22.804
IT TRIGGERED SOME OLD FEELINGS,

29:23.631 --> 29:25.328
AND I WAS AFRAID THAT
IF I REPORTED IT

29:25.459 --> 29:27.983
THE WAY I DID ONCE BEFORE
THE FEELINGS WOULD COME BACK.

29:28.114 --> 29:30.290
-OH, GOD, MEGAN,
I'M SORRY.

29:30.420 --> 29:32.031
I'M SORRY. I DIDN'T KNOW.

29:33.119 --> 29:34.381
-I'M SORRY.

29:34.511 --> 29:36.122
IF I'D REPORT IT,

29:36.252 --> 29:37.253
MAYBE THAT OTHER GIRL
WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN ATTACKED.

29:40.866 --> 29:41.997
-ALL RIGHT.

29:43.129 --> 29:44.478
NOW, WE'LL JUST TAKE THIS THING

29:44.608 --> 29:46.175
FROM THE BEGINNING
ONE STEP AT A TIME.

29:48.961 --> 29:50.266
I'LL PUT ON SOME COFFEE, HUH?

29:51.572 --> 29:55.054
DON'T WORRY.
WE'LL NAIL THIS GUY.

30:32.352 --> 30:33.527
-GOOD MORNING.

30:34.354 --> 30:35.659
DON'T STOP.

30:38.924 --> 30:41.187
-DON'T YOU WANT TO
GET AN EARLY START?

30:41.317 --> 30:42.449
-YES.

30:47.062 --> 30:48.890
-BIG DAY A HEAD OF US.

30:49.021 --> 30:50.457
WE'RE GOING TO
HAVE LOTS OF FUN.

30:51.284 --> 30:52.720
-THIS IS FUN.

30:57.420 --> 30:59.074
-YOU'RE SO BEAUTIFUL.

31:03.687 --> 31:05.689
-I'M SO HAPPY
YOU GOT THIS BOAT.

31:06.865 --> 31:08.823
I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU GOT IT FOR FREE.

31:10.651 --> 31:14.394
-WELL, I TOLD THE
BROKER I MIGHT BUY IT,

31:14.524 --> 31:16.831
BUT I HAD TO TEST IT
OUT FIRST TO MAKE SURE

31:16.962 --> 31:19.747
I CAN HANDLE LIVING IN
SUCH TIGHT QUARTERS.

31:20.835 --> 31:21.836
-AND CAN YOU?

31:22.445 --> 31:23.403
-BUY IT?

31:23.533 --> 31:24.883
WHAT, ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

31:25.013 --> 31:26.972
-HANDLE LIVING IN
SUCH TIGHT QUARTERS?

31:29.148 --> 31:32.891
-AS LONG AS YOU'RE WITH
ME THE TIGHTER THE BETTER.

31:35.676 --> 31:37.199
-I LOVE YOU, EDDIE.

31:39.158 --> 31:40.942
-AND I LOVE YOU TOO.

31:53.346 --> 31:55.304
-HE HAD THE MIRRORED
SUNGLASSES ON ALL THE TIME.

31:55.435 --> 31:57.350
YOU NEVER SAW HIS EYES?
-NO,

31:57.480 --> 32:00.092
NO, BUT I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT
I LOOK LIKE WHEN I'M SCARED.

32:01.049 --> 32:03.051
-YOU DON'T HAVE TO
BE SCARED ANYMORE.

32:04.313 --> 32:05.488
-THAT'S WHAT WE SAY TO

32:05.619 --> 32:06.663
VICTIMS TO MAKE
THEM FEEL BETTER.

32:06.794 --> 32:08.361
-I KNOW BUT
IT'S THE TRUTH.

32:09.536 --> 32:11.407
-BOY, IF HE TAKES OFF
THAT HAT AND THOSE GLASSES,

32:11.538 --> 32:13.018
HE'S GOING TO BE
MIGHTY HARD TO FIND.

32:13.757 --> 32:14.889
-I SCRATCHED HIM.

32:15.455 --> 32:16.456
-WHERE?

32:16.586 --> 32:19.459
-HIS CHEEK, HIS LEFT CHEEK.

32:25.334 --> 32:26.727
-MEGAN, TELL
HIM ABOUT THE KNIFE.

32:26.857 --> 32:28.381
-HE HAD A GUTTING BLADE.

32:28.511 --> 32:29.643
-CAN YOU DESCRIBE IT?

32:30.383 --> 32:31.558
-IN MY SLEEP,

32:33.212 --> 32:38.739
BONE LIKE ANTLER ABOUT
FIVE INCHES LONG.

32:39.218 --> 32:40.828
-GOOD. GOOD.
THAT'LL HELP.

32:40.959 --> 32:42.438
YOU GIVE ME A COUPLE
HUNDRED COPIES OF THAT SKETCH,

32:42.569 --> 32:44.701
I'LL HAVE IT POSTED IN
ALL THE TOWERS AND PIERS.

32:44.832 --> 32:47.574
-NO.
THAT COULD DRIVE HIM AWAY.

32:47.704 --> 32:49.054
WE HAVE TO CATCH HIM.

32:49.184 --> 32:50.881
-MEGAN, LOOK,
I UNDERSTAND HOW YOU FEEL,

32:51.012 --> 32:52.231
BUT THIS IS A POLICE MATTER NOW.

32:52.361 --> 32:53.754

HIS PREY ANYMORE.

32:59.151 --> 33:00.021
-MEGAN.

33:00.804 --> 33:02.719

38:33.485 --> 38:34.834
YOU'LL HAVE TO KILL ME.

38:45.018 --> 38:47.803
-DO YOU
KNOW WHY I WEAR THIS?

38:49.762 --> 38:54.462
SO THAT YOU CAN SEE YOURSELF
THE SAME WAY I SEE YOU.

38:57.726 --> 39:00.425

YOUR EYES.

MATTER WHAT YOU WANT.

39:18.965 --> 39:20.183
-GARNER,
I'M UNDER THE PIER.

39:20.314 --> 39:21.620
I NEED BACK UP NOW.

39:23.143 --> 39:25.754
-HAVE YOU EVER
HEARD THE SOUND A WHALE

39:25.885 --> 39:27.887
MAKES WHEN IT'S BEEN HARPOONED?

39:31.281 --> 39:33.458
IT SOUNDS LIKE WOMEN SCREAMING.

39:34.241 --> 39:37.679
-YOU CAN KILL ME, BUT
I WON'T SCREAM FOR YOU.

39:37.810 --> 39:39.159
-YOU'LL SCREAM.

39:41.117 --> 39:43.032
-PLEASE DON'T
MAKE ME WATCH.

39:43.163 --> 39:45.078
PLEASE TAKE OFF YOUR GLASSES.

39:50.910 --> 39:53.521
-STILL YOU
THINK YOU CAN FIGHT BACK.

39:54.392 --> 39:55.393
WELL

40:20.548 --> 40:22.681
HOW DOES IT FEEL
TO GET CAUGHT, HUH?

40:22.811 --> 40:25.248
HOW DOES IT FEEL ON THE
END OF MY LINE?

40:25.379 --> 40:26.424
TELL ME.

40:27.207 --> 40:29.427

DROWN HIM.
