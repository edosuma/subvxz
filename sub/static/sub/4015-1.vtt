Hey, Seth Rogen.
What up, man?

01:06.760 --> 01:10.128
Oh, hey, John!
Over here!

01:10.200 --> 01:13.090
<i>Welcome to Los
Angeles International Airport.</i>

01:13.160 --> 01:14.969
<i>Attention, all passengers.</i>

01:15.040 --> 01:16.963
<i>Do not leave your
baggage unattended.</i>

01:17.040 --> 01:19.611
<i>All unattended baggage
is subject to search...</i>

01:19.680 --> 01:21.921
Yay!

01:22.000 --> 01:23.809
We're so happy!

01:23.880 --> 01:25.086
Look at this!

01:25.160 --> 01:26.446
What's happening, man?

01:26.520 --> 01:27.806
Good to see you, buddy.

01:27.880 --> 01:29.325
How you doing?
I'm good, man.

01:29.440 --> 01:30.441
Yes, you are.

01:31.120 --> 01:32.201
How long has it been, man?

01:32.320 --> 01:33.446
Sometime in the last...

01:33.520 --> 01:35.488
Inside of a year or something.
Yeah.

01:35.560 --> 01:37.200
I have the best weekend
ever planned, man.

01:37.520 --> 01:39.682
Lay it on me. Ooh!
I don't want to ruin it.

01:39.960 --> 01:41.485
Seth Rogen!
Shit, here we go. Hey.

01:41.560 --> 01:42.925
How's it going, man?
Yeah, good.

01:43.040 --> 01:45.771
So, you, like, always play, like,
the same guy in every movie.

01:45.840 --> 01:47.569
When are you gonna do some,
like, real acting, man?

01:47.640 --> 01:48.641
Okay, thank you.

01:48.720 --> 01:50.722
Give me something. Give
me, like, the laugh, man.

01:50.800 --> 01:52.131
Give me the Seth Rogen laugh.

01:52.200 --> 01:54.601
Seth Rogen, everybody.

01:54.680 --> 01:57.968
All right, I've landed. I'm here.
We've said our hellos.

01:58.040 --> 02:01.044
Can we please go to
fucking Carl's Jr.?

02:01.480 --> 02:02.641
Oh.

02:02.720 --> 02:05.803
I would... I would love to.
I'm on a...

02:05.880 --> 02:07.441
I can't really eat
that stuff right now.

02:07.520 --> 02:08.759
I'm on a, uh...
What?

02:08.840 --> 02:09.841
I'm on this cleanse.

02:09.919 --> 02:11.649
You're...
You're on a what?

02:11.720 --> 02:12.960
I'm on a cleanse.

02:15.040 --> 02:17.008
What?
It's good for you.

02:17.080 --> 02:18.730
I didn't know... You're supposed
to take six shits a day.

02:18.800 --> 02:20.245
That's not true.
It is true!

02:20.280 --> 02:21.841
You're supposed to
shit twice a day. No.

02:21.880 --> 02:23.530
That's not true. That's
what they used to think.

02:23.600 --> 02:25.887
Now they know you're supposed
to shit six times a day.

02:25.960 --> 02:28.531
So you're not drinking. You're
not smoking weed. You're not...

02:28.640 --> 02:31.405
No, no, I'm drinking and
smoking weed. But...

02:31.480 --> 02:33.164
I'm on a cleanse.
I'm not psychotic.

02:33.240 --> 02:35.004
Look, man, if you
stopped eating gluten,

02:35.080 --> 02:37.162
you'd feel way fucking
better all day.

02:37.240 --> 02:39.200
Whenever you feel shitty,
that's 'cause of gluten.

02:39.240 --> 02:40.366
That's not true.
It is.

02:40.480 --> 02:42.482
Who the fuck told you not to eat gluten?
It's just true.

02:42.560 --> 02:44.164
You don't even know
what gluten is.

02:44.240 --> 02:45.480
I know what fucking gluten is.

02:45.600 --> 02:46.806
No, you have no idea
what gluten is.

02:46.880 --> 02:47.881
I do know what gluten is.

02:47.960 --> 02:49.485
Gluten's a vague term.

02:49.560 --> 02:52.643
It's something that's used to categorize
things that are bad, you know?

02:52.720 --> 02:55.371
Calories, that's a gluten.
Fat, that's a gluten.

02:55.440 --> 02:58.489
Somebody just told you you
probably shouldn't eat gluten,

02:58.560 --> 03:00.244
you're like, "Oh, I guess
I shouldn't eat gluten."

03:00.320 --> 03:02.482
Gluten means bad shit, man,
and I'm not eating it.

03:03.680 --> 03:05.011
Mmm!

03:05.280 --> 03:06.441
Mmm-hmm.
Oh!

03:06.520 --> 03:07.521
God!

03:07.800 --> 03:10.280
Each bite is better
than the previous bite.

03:10.360 --> 03:11.964
It is.
Gluten!

03:12.520 --> 03:13.681
Hey, this looks beautiful.

03:13.760 --> 03:15.205
Yeah. Do you like it?
I totally redid it.

03:15.280 --> 03:16.281
It's fucking awesome.

03:16.360 --> 03:17.566
It's all new.
Those are new.

03:17.680 --> 03:19.284
God damn, son!
It's pretty nice, huh?

03:19.320 --> 03:21.561
So this is how the other half lives.

03:21.680 --> 03:23.364
Come on.
Amazing.

03:23.440 --> 03:25.363
Air hockey tables.
Jesus Murphy!

03:25.440 --> 03:27.010
Right? Okay,
get ready, Jay.

03:27.080 --> 03:28.047
What?

03:28.120 --> 03:29.167
I have a little
surprise for you.

03:29.240 --> 03:30.207
Okay.

03:30.280 --> 03:32.567
Here's the best weekend you
ever had in your life. Oh!

03:34.080 --> 03:35.206
Look at it, man.

03:35.280 --> 03:36.884
Oh, my...
Are you serious?

03:36.960 --> 03:38.086
It's all of your
favorite things.

03:38.120 --> 03:41.567
Starburst and Airheads on a...
Yeah.

03:41.640 --> 03:42.607
And it says "Jay."

03:42.680 --> 03:44.409
In joints.
In joints.

03:44.480 --> 03:46.369
It says "Jay" in jays.

03:47.120 --> 03:50.681
Seth Rogen, you are
just the best people.

03:50.760 --> 03:53.161
Come on, I know you don't love it
in LA, so I figure I'll make it...

03:53.240 --> 03:55.641
You know, I'll lube up
your entry a little bit.

03:55.720 --> 03:57.722
It eases the transition.
Yeah, right?

03:57.840 --> 03:59.410
This is the
much-needed foreplay.

03:59.480 --> 04:00.481
You know what else I got?

04:00.560 --> 04:01.766
Yo, this...

04:01.840 --> 04:03.285
A 3-D television.
No, you didn't...

04:03.360 --> 04:05.249
I got a 3-D TV.
Are you serious?

04:06.440 --> 04:08.727
Oh, my God.
I did it, man.

04:08.800 --> 04:10.040
What?

04:10.120 --> 04:11.610
Let's get into it.

04:11.680 --> 04:13.364
Oh, my God, bud.

04:13.480 --> 04:14.925
It's Gandalf the Grey's pipe.

04:15.000 --> 04:16.240
Damn, no shit.

04:16.360 --> 04:18.488
Hello, little hobbit.

04:18.560 --> 04:20.927
Spark my ganja.
Yeah.

04:23.320 --> 04:25.687
I'm a well-known
homosexual advocate.

04:25.760 --> 04:27.922
<i>♪ Backstreet's back, all right</i>

04:33.000 --> 04:36.368

04:36.800 --> 04:38.450

04:47.040 --> 04:49.281
Oh, my eyes feel
like they're melting.

04:49.360 --> 04:50.441
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

04:50.560 --> 04:51.971
I need a break.

04:52.760 --> 04:54.046
Oh. You know what,
actually?

04:54.120 --> 04:55.963
We should go to
Franco's house soon.

04:56.040 --> 04:57.320
He's having
a housewarming party.

04:57.400 --> 04:58.811
He just finished
building his house.

04:58.880 --> 04:59.920
I haven't even seen it yet,

04:59.960 --> 05:01.803
but it's supposed
to be bonkers.

05:01.880 --> 05:03.086
I haven't been
in LA in, like, a year,

05:03.160 --> 05:06.448
and I came here
to chill with you.

05:06.520 --> 05:08.648
We can chill together, and we'll
chill with those other guys.

05:08.720 --> 05:10.643
We'll all chill
as one big unit.

05:10.720 --> 05:12.131
Will I even know anybody there?

05:12.200 --> 05:13.247
You know James Franco.

05:13.320 --> 05:15.641
James Franco doesn't
even know my name.

05:15.720 --> 05:16.926
Jonah Hill will be there.

05:17.000 --> 05:18.490
Can't stand him.
He can't stand me.

05:18.560 --> 05:21.291
He's, like, the nicest guy in the world!
He likes you so much.

05:21.360 --> 05:23.169
He specifically talks
about how he likes you.

05:23.240 --> 05:24.401
Out of nowhere, he just
said, "You know what?"

05:24.480 --> 05:25.527
"Jay's an inspiration."

05:25.600 --> 05:28.251
There's no way he said that.
Also, just can't stand him.

05:28.320 --> 05:29.924
Okay, fine.
Craig Robinson.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.001
Never met him.

05:31.080 --> 05:32.491
He's hilarious.

05:32.600 --> 05:34.648
Sweats a lot,
but he's a great guy.

05:34.720 --> 05:36.245
So it's gonna be fun, man.

05:36.840 --> 05:39.730
For you, I will go.

05:39.800 --> 05:42.371
I promise, I'll stay
with you all night, okay?

05:42.440 --> 05:45.683
I won't ditch you. No, 'cause I
want to be with you all night.

05:45.760 --> 05:47.922
And you know why else?

05:48.000 --> 05:50.367
'Cause nobody puts
Jay in the corner.

06:01.600 --> 06:02.886
Awesome.

06:02.960 --> 06:03.927
Wow!

06:04.040 --> 06:05.644
Thank you. Thank you.
There you go. Cool.

06:05.760 --> 06:07.250
Thanks a lot, eh?
Thanks a lot.

06:07.320 --> 06:08.367
Okay, man.

06:08.920 --> 06:10.490
Holy shit.

06:11.200 --> 06:12.690
Wow!

06:13.640 --> 06:15.165
This is crazy!

06:15.240 --> 06:17.527
Yeah?
Yeah, man, right?

06:17.600 --> 06:19.728
Look at it.
A bit much.

06:19.800 --> 06:21.245
I don't think it is a bit much.

06:21.320 --> 06:22.560
I think it's right
on the money.

06:22.640 --> 06:24.165
What is he, Pablo Escobar?

06:24.240 --> 06:25.526
Come on, man, this is
an awesome street.

06:25.600 --> 06:27.284
Channing Tatum lives up there.

06:27.360 --> 06:29.124
Oh, for the love of... Will
you stop talking about...

06:29.240 --> 06:30.321
This is the sexiest
street in America.

06:30.400 --> 06:31.526
You and Channing Tatum.

06:31.600 --> 06:32.886
I think he's attractive.

06:34.240 --> 06:36.163
I think it's a cool house.
I know you do.

06:36.240 --> 06:37.765
I can't wait to see inside it.

06:37.840 --> 06:39.444
That's why I'm excited.

06:39.520 --> 06:43.241
Ha-ha! Yes!
What's up, man? Seth!

06:43.320 --> 06:45.243
So happy you're here.
I'm so happy to be here.

06:45.320 --> 06:46.560
Hey, Johnny, what's up?

06:46.640 --> 06:48.085
It's Jay.
It's Jay.

06:48.160 --> 06:50.527
I'll never forget it again, man.
Good to see you.

06:50.600 --> 06:52.329
Nice to see you. Come on in.
Yeah! Yeah, great.

06:52.400 --> 06:54.641
Check it out.
My new place!

06:54.720 --> 06:56.449
Awesome, man!

06:56.560 --> 06:57.686
Designed it myself.

06:57.760 --> 07:00.525
Really cool. This place
is beautiful, man.

07:00.600 --> 07:02.602
This place is
like a piece of me.

07:02.680 --> 07:04.762
You two just stepped inside me.

07:05.320 --> 07:07.926
You let us both
cum inside you. Yeah.

07:08.000 --> 07:10.731
Icing on the cake.
Check it out.

07:11.480 --> 07:12.527
Painted them myself.

07:12.920 --> 07:13.921
Huh.

07:14.000 --> 07:15.923
Side by side.
A team.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.047
Holy shit.

07:17.520 --> 07:19.249
So, is it weird?

07:19.320 --> 07:21.288
No.
You sure?

07:21.360 --> 07:23.044
I really like it.

07:23.120 --> 07:24.246
What do you think, Jay?

07:24.320 --> 07:26.448
I'm not a big art guy.

07:26.520 --> 07:27.806
You don't like art?

07:27.880 --> 07:29.769
Well, come on...

07:29.840 --> 07:31.763
You play video games?
Yes.

07:31.840 --> 07:33.888
Well, guess what, buddy?
You like art.

07:33.960 --> 07:34.961
Yep.

07:35.040 --> 07:36.166
You ever been to Subway?

07:36.240 --> 07:37.287
Yes.

07:37.360 --> 07:38.771
You order a sandwich?

07:38.840 --> 07:40.968
Somebody put that together for you, dude.
That's art.

07:41.040 --> 07:42.121
Sandwich artist.

07:42.200 --> 07:43.440
So, let me
lay this on you, Jay.

07:43.520 --> 07:44.521
Oh, fuck.

07:44.600 --> 07:45.806
Your mama's pussy
was the canvas.

07:45.880 --> 07:47.644
Your dad's dick
was the paintbrush.

07:47.720 --> 07:49.722
Boom.
You're the art. Huh?

07:50.640 --> 07:52.244
Thanks, James Franco.
You got it.

07:52.320 --> 07:53.810
Seth!
Mindy, hello.

07:53.880 --> 07:55.484
Oh, my God, great to see you.
Oh, you, too.

07:55.560 --> 07:56.800
Long time.
How's it going?

07:56.880 --> 07:59.167
You know Jay? I don't think
I've ever actually met you.

07:59.240 --> 08:00.890
You were so good in
<i>Million Dollar Baby.</i>

08:01.000 --> 08:03.002
That's amazing. Thank you
so much for saying that.

08:03.080 --> 08:05.003
Oh, my God, if I don't
fuck Michael Cera tonight,

08:05.120 --> 08:07.088
I'm gonna blow my brains out.
What?

08:07.160 --> 08:09.367
Fucking pale, 110 pounds,

08:09.440 --> 08:12.922
hairless, probably has a huge
cock, coked out of his mind...

08:13.000 --> 08:15.241
You can do a lot better.
That's just trouble.

08:15.320 --> 08:18.881
So, Ri-Ri, how about you,
you ever see a psychiatrist?

08:18.960 --> 08:20.166
Um...

08:23.600 --> 08:25.320
That's not cool.
Don't touch my butt, bitch.

08:25.400 --> 08:27.448
Michael, that's not cool. Would
you shut the fuck up, Jason!

08:27.520 --> 08:29.409
We're playing a game, man.

08:29.840 --> 08:31.649
Say cheese, baby.

08:33.000 --> 08:34.445
What's up, buddy?
How's it going, dude?

08:34.520 --> 08:35.726
Good to see you, man.

08:35.799 --> 08:37.370
Is that Jay Baruchel?
Hi, there. Hey.

08:37.440 --> 08:38.520
Oh, my God, get in here, dude.

08:38.600 --> 08:40.240
How's it going, Jonah?
What are you doing?

08:40.280 --> 08:42.520
Good. How you doing, buddy?
Oh, my gosh.

08:42.600 --> 08:44.648
Welcome back.
Thank you very much.

08:44.720 --> 08:46.609
When'd you get in?
Uh, this morning,

08:46.680 --> 08:48.523
and boy, are my arms tired.

08:50.120 --> 08:51.326
Dude, that's great.

08:51.400 --> 08:52.401
- Thank you.
- Sick.

08:52.480 --> 08:54.005
What have you guys been doing?

08:54.080 --> 08:55.923
Oh, we just hung out all day.

08:56.000 --> 08:59.925
Ate a bunch of dirty burgers, and
smoked about a fucking pound of weed

09:00.000 --> 09:01.411
and played
a bunch of video games.

09:01.480 --> 09:03.721
Weed is tight. Weed is tight.
That's awesome.

09:03.800 --> 09:05.040
That's awesome.
Weed is awesome.

09:05.080 --> 09:07.447
It was like the golfing
sequence in <i>Navy SEALs.</i>

09:07.520 --> 09:09.568
Sick reference, though, bro.
Oh, thanks, bud.

09:09.640 --> 09:11.802
Dude, your references are out of control.
Everyone knows that.

09:11.880 --> 09:13.484
Hey, thanks, man.
I'm jealous.

09:13.560 --> 09:15.847
I would have been there
in a heartbeat,

09:15.920 --> 09:19.242
but, uh, I actually just adopted
this incontinent spaniel.

09:19.320 --> 09:20.401
She's a really beautiful soul.

09:20.480 --> 09:22.130
Her name's Ahjhai.
Ahjhai?

09:22.200 --> 09:23.247
Yeah.
How do you spell it?

09:26.160 --> 09:27.127
You want to see
a picture of her?

09:27.200 --> 09:29.248
Oh, she's so sweet.
Hey!

09:29.320 --> 09:30.560
- Look at her.
- Aw!

09:30.640 --> 09:32.324
She can't bark. She
doesn't know how, so...

09:32.400 --> 09:33.481
She doesn't know
how to bark, even?

09:33.560 --> 09:34.561
She doesn't know how to bark,

09:34.640 --> 09:36.244
so I've tried to teach her

09:36.320 --> 09:38.482
and she just kind of
screams, and so she was up,

09:38.560 --> 09:41.245
had her face smushed against
the cage, and was, like...

09:41.320 --> 09:42.560
Ah!

09:43.440 --> 09:44.851
Yeah, cool. Um...

09:45.520 --> 09:47.807
Tell you what, boys,
I'm kind of jonesing,

09:47.880 --> 09:51.248
so I'm gonna find someone I can bum
a smoke off of outside, all right?

09:51.360 --> 09:53.089
That's tight, dude.
Honestly, I like you.

09:53.160 --> 09:54.161
Hey, likewise.

09:54.280 --> 09:55.691
Okay, dude, come back.

09:55.760 --> 09:58.604
I'll be right back. You're holding court.
All right, boys.

09:58.880 --> 10:01.884
Dude. I know. I think we're
making some progress.

10:01.960 --> 10:02.927
That was really good.

10:03.000 --> 10:04.361
And honestly,
he's your old friend.

10:04.400 --> 10:05.765
We're your new friends.
He feels threatened.

10:05.840 --> 10:06.841
Yeah, man.

10:06.960 --> 10:08.610
You know, and I get it.

10:08.680 --> 10:09.647
It's gonna be fine.

10:09.720 --> 10:11.120
I honestly think
tonight's the night

10:11.160 --> 10:12.360
we bust this whole thing open.

10:12.400 --> 10:15.563
And I'm lucky. It's the
same thing a lot, though.

10:15.640 --> 10:17.290
It's, like, my TV wife
opens the fridge,

10:17.360 --> 10:20.204
and is, like, "What happened
to the birthday cake?"

10:20.280 --> 10:22.965
And I come outwith, like,
a little frosting, like,

10:23.040 --> 10:24.401
"What birthday cake?"

10:24.440 --> 10:26.044
'Cause you ate the cake! Yeah.

10:26.120 --> 10:27.326
'Cause you ate the cake!

10:27.400 --> 10:28.640
"It's my birthday."

10:30.480 --> 10:33.051
That's why y'all number one.
'Cause of that.

10:33.400 --> 10:34.447
You're Jay, right?
Yeah.

10:34.520 --> 10:35.521
Seth's boy?
Yeah.

10:35.600 --> 10:36.886
How you doing, man?
Good to see you.

10:36.960 --> 10:38.041
Good.
Likewise, likewise.

10:38.080 --> 10:40.082
I'm Craig, man. This is Emma.
Hi. Hi, there.

10:40.400 --> 10:41.811
You just in town
visiting him, or what?

10:41.880 --> 10:45.043
Yeah. Just for a little
visit, you know.

10:45.120 --> 10:47.122
I try to not come
down here very much.

10:47.200 --> 10:48.486
I don't really love it here.

10:48.560 --> 10:49.527
You don't like LA?

10:49.600 --> 10:53.400
I'm just not really
into the LA lifestyle.

10:53.920 --> 10:55.206
What lifestyle are you into?

10:55.280 --> 10:57.806
Look at him. He's, like,
a hipster, right?

10:57.880 --> 11:00.451
No, I'm not a hipster, at all.

11:00.520 --> 11:03.126
Yeah, yeah, you do seem
to hate a lot of things,

11:03.200 --> 11:04.884
and the bottom of your
pants are awful tight.

11:04.960 --> 11:08.806
No, I just... I don't like Los Angeles.
It doesn't make me a hipster.

11:08.880 --> 11:11.121
I'll bet you hate movies
that are universally loved.

11:11.200 --> 11:12.201
I don't even...

11:12.280 --> 11:13.361
You like <i>Forrest Gump?</i>

11:13.440 --> 11:16.011
No, no, it's a horrendous
piece of shit.

11:16.080 --> 11:18.162
"Life is like a box
of chocolates," no?

11:18.280 --> 11:19.770
Yeah, no, I'm familiar with it.

11:20.840 --> 11:23.047
"You never know
what you're gonna get."

11:24.280 --> 11:26.965
Why don't we do a sequel
to <i>Pineapple Express?</i>

11:27.080 --> 11:28.445
I would love to do
a sequel to <i>Pineapple.</i>

11:28.520 --> 11:29.521
Do you have any ideas, or...

11:29.600 --> 11:31.204
I do have an idea.
What?

11:31.280 --> 11:34.489
It's that Red, Danny, has
become, like, the drug lord,

11:34.560 --> 11:36.528
you know, since we
killed the other one,

11:36.600 --> 11:38.682
and he wants to assassinate
Woody Harrelson,

11:38.800 --> 11:41.770
'cause he's gonna give a speech
that makes all of weed legal,

11:41.840 --> 11:44.207
effectively rendering
drug lords out of business.

11:44.320 --> 11:46.129
Awesome. Yeah, it's
fucking awesome,

11:46.200 --> 11:48.806
but we don't have... We don't
know how it should end yet.

11:48.880 --> 11:50.166
I... I know.

11:50.280 --> 11:52.886
Danny's trying to kill us. Yeah.

11:52.960 --> 11:55.566
And I sacrifice myself for you.

11:55.640 --> 11:58.086
And he kills me,

11:58.160 --> 11:59.491
and I die for you.

12:00.080 --> 12:03.209
And Danny fucking eats me.

12:03.320 --> 12:05.163
Why does he eat you?
I don't know.

12:05.240 --> 12:07.766
I'm just trying to think of,
like, the nastiest way to go.

12:07.840 --> 12:10.241
Yeah, he could eat you.
Okay. That's a good idea, man.

12:10.320 --> 12:12.607
He's just out of his mind.
He just, like, eats me.

12:13.080 --> 12:14.286
Hey, Chris.
How's it going?

12:14.360 --> 12:16.328
Hey, does this coke smell funny?
Ooh!

12:16.400 --> 12:18.323
Fuck! Michael, what
the fuck, man?

12:18.400 --> 12:19.970
That's expensive shit,
motherfucker!

12:20.040 --> 12:21.121
What are you doing?

12:21.200 --> 12:23.600
I've never fucking done cocaine, dude.
Why does it fucking...

12:23.680 --> 12:25.569
Well, you did the best shit
possible for your first time,

12:25.680 --> 12:26.681
'cause that's good fucking...

12:26.760 --> 12:27.966
Fuck, fuck, fuck,
I'm nervous, dude.

12:28.000 --> 12:29.365
I don't know what... What
is wrong with you, man?

12:29.440 --> 12:30.521
Look, he's freaking out.
Oh, shit.

12:30.600 --> 12:32.045
I've never done this
fucking drug before, man.

12:32.120 --> 12:33.121
Mike, please.

12:33.200 --> 12:34.850
I'll walk you through it.
I will walk you through it.

12:34.920 --> 12:36.649
Mike, no one...
I'll be your guide.

12:36.760 --> 12:38.364
You're fine, Chris. You're fine.
Is it on...

12:38.440 --> 12:39.521
You got some in
your mustache, baby.

12:39.600 --> 12:40.647
What are you...
Michael!

12:41.080 --> 12:42.923
Now, fellas, I
want you to real sexy right now.

12:43.000 --> 12:45.082
We're gonna sing
to all the ladies.

12:45.200 --> 12:48.602
All the fellas go like this,
in your Barry White voice.

12:48.680 --> 12:50.364
<i>♪ Take your panties off</i>

12:50.440 --> 12:52.044

Like an angel.

13:08.640 --> 13:10.290
What about
the host of the party?

13:10.360 --> 13:12.044

13:39.040 --> 13:40.280
What's not kid-friendly?

13:40.400 --> 13:41.845
There's a lot of sharp edges.
Concrete, sharp edges.

13:41.920 --> 13:43.649
He's gonna bust his head
open on one of those things.

13:43.760 --> 13:45.840
A kid could fall off this
fucking railing right here.

13:45.880 --> 13:47.609
That's why you have the
railing, so they don't fall.

13:47.760 --> 13:49.683
Hey. Sorry. I want to
have kids one day.

13:49.760 --> 13:52.366
Hey, Jay.
Oh, hey, hi, Jonah.

13:52.440 --> 13:54.442
Is there any place around here I
can buy a pack of cigarettes?

13:54.560 --> 13:55.607
Yeah.

13:55.680 --> 13:57.921
There's a place like, it's
like, four blocks away, maybe.

13:57.960 --> 13:59.325
You want to come with me?

13:59.440 --> 14:01.408
Give me this much time.
That much joint time.

14:02.680 --> 14:03.886
Oh!

14:03.960 --> 14:05.769
Jesus!
Hey, Jay.

14:06.240 --> 14:08.288
Hey, you need to use the toilet, honey?
Go ahead.

14:08.920 --> 14:10.763
Nope, I'm... I sorry.

14:11.120 --> 14:13.361
Who wants a sip?
Sip time.

14:25.520 --> 14:26.601
You okay, man?

14:26.680 --> 14:28.364
It's nothing.
It's just, you know,

14:28.440 --> 14:31.569
as soon as we got there, you did
what you said you wouldn't do.

14:31.680 --> 14:33.967
What did I do? You just
fucking ditched my ass.

14:34.040 --> 14:36.850
I didn't ditch you.
Are you kidding me, man?

14:36.920 --> 14:38.126
I did not ditch you.

14:38.200 --> 14:41.568
I was talking to Jonah, and then
you left to go have a cigarette.

14:41.640 --> 14:44.723
Well, you know, my
cigarette was an excuse.

14:44.800 --> 14:46.882
I really went outside 'cause
Jonah was being a prick.

14:46.960 --> 14:48.644
Jonah was not being a prick.

14:48.720 --> 14:50.245
If anything, you were
kind of being a prick.

14:50.320 --> 14:51.890
Jonah's the nicest
guy ever, man.

14:51.960 --> 14:54.691
Oh, my God, that's a
thin veneer of kindness.

14:54.760 --> 14:55.761
Nobody's that nice.

14:55.840 --> 14:56.921
Jonah is that nice.

14:57.040 --> 14:58.565
Serial killers are that nice.

14:58.640 --> 15:00.563
Just answer me one question.

15:00.640 --> 15:02.927
Is Michael Cera's butthole
as adorable as I pictured?

15:03.000 --> 15:04.240
Oh, for fuck's sake.

15:04.320 --> 15:06.368
I picture it looking
like a little donut,

15:06.440 --> 15:08.044
like a little
pink sprinkled donut.

15:08.480 --> 15:10.084
Oh, it's so bright in here.

15:10.160 --> 15:11.764
It is fucking bright.

15:11.840 --> 15:13.604
Oh, I'm so high.

15:13.680 --> 15:17.127
There's so many delicious choices.
What do I do?

15:17.200 --> 15:19.089
I'm gonna get something to drink.
Okay.

15:19.160 --> 15:20.924
Excuse me, would it be possible

15:21.000 --> 15:22.445
for my daughter to
use your restroom?

15:22.520 --> 15:23.965
She's really got to go.

15:24.040 --> 15:26.441
Read the sign.
Customers only.

15:26.520 --> 15:27.521
Seriously?

15:27.600 --> 15:30.251
Why the fuck you think
I put up the sign?

15:30.320 --> 15:32.084
It's okay, Dad.
I can hold it.

15:32.200 --> 15:34.680
Let's just buy
something for your mother.

15:34.760 --> 15:37.331
Yeah, well,
I guess you better, huh?

15:37.400 --> 15:39.164
This cash register lady
is mean.

15:39.240 --> 15:40.969
I have anxiety. Will
you buy this for me?

15:41.040 --> 15:42.485
When I'm stoned,
I can't do this.

15:42.560 --> 15:44.767
I think I'm just gonna
head back to your place.

15:44.880 --> 15:47.724
I'm not really liking it very
much over there at Franco's.

15:47.840 --> 15:50.241
Dude, I want you to get to know these guys.
That's never gonna happen

15:50.320 --> 15:53.244
if you don't put in any
effort whatsoever, okay?

15:53.320 --> 15:54.890
I hate it in there.

15:54.960 --> 15:57.566
I just want to drink some
pop and smoke some weed.

16:15.480 --> 16:16.720
What about...

16:19.400 --> 16:21.164
What about me?

16:46.440 --> 16:47.930
Are you okay?
Are you okay?

16:48.000 --> 16:49.411
Did you just see that?

16:49.480 --> 16:50.811
What the hell?

16:52.160 --> 16:54.970
Oh, my God, Jesus, Jesus!
Run, run, run!

16:56.240 --> 16:58.004
This way!
Okay, okay, okay!

17:03.120 --> 17:04.848
Oh, my God!
Oh, oh...

17:04.960 --> 17:06.200
Oh, Jesus.

17:07.760 --> 17:08.886
Run!

17:08.960 --> 17:10.290
Jesus Christ!

17:10.640 --> 17:13.564
Why the fuck did you
bring me down here?

17:15.800 --> 17:17.882
The fuck, Seth? I don't
know what's happening!

17:19.160 --> 17:21.049
We're going back to Franco's.
Why?

17:21.839 --> 17:24.047
Just run!
Keep running!

17:24.119 --> 17:25.359
Oh, my fuck!

17:27.040 --> 17:29.202
We are going back to Franco's!

17:29.280 --> 17:30.361
Oh, God damn it.

17:31.960 --> 17:33.485
Jesus!
Oh, shit!

17:34.360 --> 17:37.523
This way. We're almost there!
We're so close!

17:42.800 --> 17:43.801
Hey, you guys okay?

17:43.880 --> 17:45.006
Are you guys okay?

17:45.080 --> 17:47.924
There was a crazy earthquake.
Did you guys feel that?

17:48.000 --> 17:49.411
That was insane.
Fuck, no.

17:49.480 --> 17:50.481
We can't feel anything in here.

17:50.560 --> 17:52.244
This place is
a fucking fortress.

17:52.320 --> 17:54.084
That wasn't an earthquake, man.

17:54.200 --> 17:55.804
That was something way
fucking crazier. No...

17:55.880 --> 17:56.881
What's crazier
than an earthquake?

17:56.960 --> 18:00.407
There were beams of blue
light coming out of the sky

18:00.480 --> 18:03.006
and people getting
sucked up into the sky.

18:03.080 --> 18:05.287
He's on hallucinogens.

18:05.360 --> 18:09.081
Come on, guys. Don't bully Jay.
He's a sweetheart.

18:09.160 --> 18:10.880
Keep going, man. What
are you talking about?

18:11.840 --> 18:14.081
There were people,
and they were there,

18:14.160 --> 18:16.766
and they got
sucked up into the sky.

18:16.840 --> 18:18.649
Jay.
Sucked up into the sky?

18:18.720 --> 18:20.290
Nobody got sucked up in here.

18:20.360 --> 18:22.362
I got sucked off here.

18:26.280 --> 18:27.805
No, okay, ask Seth.
He was...

18:27.880 --> 18:29.006
You were there.
Tell them.

18:29.080 --> 18:31.481
Seth, what the fuck's
he talking about?

18:34.240 --> 18:37.164
I have no idea what he's
talking about honestly.

18:37.240 --> 18:40.005
Did anybody get
sucked up into the sky?

18:40.080 --> 18:41.161
I didn't see anything.

18:41.200 --> 18:42.645
I don't know what
he's talking about.

18:42.720 --> 18:44.290
You were there with me.
What are you saying?

18:44.360 --> 18:47.360
All those people that were in the store
with us, they just fucking vanished.

18:47.400 --> 18:49.164
I didn't see blue light
sucking people up in the sky.

18:49.240 --> 18:51.641
You sound crazy, man. We
should just be lucky we're...

18:51.720 --> 18:52.767
It's not over!

18:52.840 --> 18:54.001
It's okay. Just relax.

18:54.440 --> 18:58.650
Everyone, it's all right. Just a little tremor.
Party's still going.

18:58.720 --> 19:00.802
In-N-Out truck's
coming in 10 minutes.

19:01.960 --> 19:03.849
- Yes.
- Animal style!

19:03.960 --> 19:05.610
Oh, my fuck!

19:05.720 --> 19:07.529
- Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!
- Move! Move!

19:07.600 --> 19:09.807
Move, move, move, move!
This place is safe!

19:09.880 --> 19:11.644
This place is not safe!

19:11.720 --> 19:13.006
Craig, where you going, man?

19:13.080 --> 19:14.889
It's a fucking earthquake! Fuck!

19:15.000 --> 19:16.809
Move, move, move, come on! Get
out of my way. Move, girl!

19:16.920 --> 19:19.082
- Oh, my God, Seth!
- Oh, shit!

19:19.160 --> 19:20.571
Seth.
What the fuck?

19:20.680 --> 19:24.002
Don't go on the grass,
not everybody on the grass!

19:34.520 --> 19:36.045
What the fuck?

19:36.120 --> 19:37.610
Oh, God!

19:37.640 --> 19:39.244
What the fuck is happening?
Paul!

19:39.320 --> 19:40.731
What's happening?

19:40.800 --> 19:43.531
All right, everybody,
listen up. Listen up.

19:43.600 --> 19:46.285
Who took my fucking
cell phone, man?

19:46.360 --> 19:48.931
Martin, empty your pockets!
What?

19:49.040 --> 19:51.441
I saw you in the bathroom, man!
Somebody dial my phone!

19:51.520 --> 19:53.363
Shut the fuck up!
It's unbelievable!

19:53.440 --> 19:56.728
It's unacceptable after all the
coke I've wasted on you people.

19:56.840 --> 19:57.887
I've thrown it away.

19:57.960 --> 19:59.246
I didn't take your
fucking cell phone.

19:59.280 --> 20:02.443
310... Whoa, whoa, whoa! Mike,
Mike, Mike, Mike, Mike, Mike...

20:04.160 --> 20:05.446
My face!

20:05.520 --> 20:07.761
What's happening to me?
What's happening?

20:07.840 --> 20:09.205
Oh, my God!

20:22.120 --> 20:23.929
Oh, shit, that's embarrassing.

20:42.320 --> 20:43.321
Rihanna!

20:51.080 --> 20:52.127
Please give me your foot!

20:52.200 --> 20:53.611
Oh, my God!

20:56.520 --> 20:58.204
Craig, Craig, help me.
I'm losing my grip!

20:58.280 --> 20:59.645
It's too late for you!
You're already in the hole!

20:59.720 --> 21:00.767
What the fuck
are you talking about?

21:00.840 --> 21:01.921
Get the fuck out of my way!

21:04.560 --> 21:05.846
Oh!

21:05.920 --> 21:06.921
Sorry.

21:08.280 --> 21:09.611
Karen!

21:09.680 --> 21:12.365
Seth, come on! Get in the house!
Come on, Seth!

21:16.600 --> 21:18.682
Oh, my God, I'm gonna die!

21:20.800 --> 21:22.165
Martin!

21:22.240 --> 21:24.447
Oh, shit!
Kevin! Kevin!

21:24.520 --> 21:25.567
What the fuck?

21:25.680 --> 21:27.330
Geez, get the fuck
off me, Aziz!

21:27.560 --> 21:29.688
Ow, ow, ow!

21:31.360 --> 21:34.011
Fuck you, Kevin!

21:34.080 --> 21:36.287
Oh, God, no, get your
fucking hands off me!

21:36.360 --> 21:37.646
Get your fucking...

21:49.320 --> 21:51.322
No!

21:51.400 --> 21:53.482
Jay, I can't hold on
much longer.

21:53.560 --> 21:56.484
You have to reach out
and grab me. You hear?

21:56.560 --> 22:00.281
Okay, uh, you take my hand,
and I will swing you up.

22:00.360 --> 22:02.010
Are you sure? I'm gonna
give you my whole weight.

22:02.120 --> 22:03.485
I'm gonna reach for you, all right?
Yeah, yeah.

22:03.560 --> 22:05.324
Are you sure you can do that?

22:05.400 --> 22:06.640
I can grab you on three.

22:06.760 --> 22:08.330
One, two, three.

22:11.600 --> 22:12.601
All right, buddy.

22:12.680 --> 22:14.682
Now I'm gonna,
I'm gonna swing across.

22:14.760 --> 22:15.807
I got you, buddy.

22:15.880 --> 22:17.400
You're gonna hold
my weight, all of it.

22:17.440 --> 22:18.441
Okay, come on.

22:18.520 --> 22:20.522
You can hold on to my full weight?
I can do it.

22:20.600 --> 22:21.600
I don't want to die.
Okay.

22:21.640 --> 22:23.324
One, two...
Two, three.

22:23.800 --> 22:25.040
No!

22:25.920 --> 22:29.083
No! No!

22:51.480 --> 22:53.164
Oh, man.

22:54.920 --> 22:56.126
Fuck.

23:06.320 --> 23:07.606
Holy shit!
What happened?

23:07.680 --> 23:09.250
Jay, you're alive.
Jay.

23:09.320 --> 23:10.685
Oh, thank God, Jay.
I'm not dead yet.

23:10.760 --> 23:12.285
I told you guys
not to go outside.

23:12.360 --> 23:13.407
What just happened?

23:13.480 --> 23:14.845
Jesus Christ, they are
all fucking dead.

23:14.920 --> 23:16.490
I told you guys
not to run outside.

23:16.560 --> 23:17.561
You all right?

23:17.640 --> 23:19.563
I tried to save Aziz.
I tried.

23:19.640 --> 23:21.449
You did your best, man.
I love you.

23:21.520 --> 23:23.807
Why the fuck did you
guys run out there?

23:23.920 --> 23:25.445
You know what, James,
can you lower your voice?

23:25.520 --> 23:26.726
You're freaking out Jay!

23:26.840 --> 23:28.649
Maybe I'm a little
freaked out, too!

23:28.760 --> 23:30.285
- He's not as strong as you.
- They all fell in.

23:30.400 --> 23:32.528
- Look at my house!
- I tried to save them. They all fell in.

23:32.680 --> 23:35.251
Get your fucking hands off me.
Jonah, stop touching me.

23:35.320 --> 23:36.890
Can we get Jay
some water, please?

23:36.960 --> 23:38.166
Can we get him some hydration?

23:38.200 --> 23:39.690
- He needs to be hydrated.
- The water's not working!

23:39.760 --> 23:41.250
Everyone just
runs out the door!

23:41.320 --> 23:42.606
My phone is dead.

23:42.680 --> 23:44.364
Guys, the fucking
internet's not working!

23:44.440 --> 23:46.329
Let's watch the TV.
Let's check the news.

23:46.400 --> 23:48.164
Where is the TV?

23:48.280 --> 23:50.282
It's in the floor.
In the floor?

23:50.360 --> 23:52.089
- Oh, that's dope.
- Yeah, cool, huh?

23:52.200 --> 23:53.201
That's really neat.

23:53.280 --> 23:54.691
That is impressive, James.

23:54.800 --> 23:56.882
<i>The biggest earthquake
to ever hit Les...</i>

23:56.960 --> 23:59.770
<i>Officers urging people to stay
in their homes right now.</i>

23:59.840 --> 24:01.842
<i>And also reports of
looting and rioting</i>

24:01.960 --> 24:02.961
<i>are spreading across the city.</i>

24:03.040 --> 24:04.201
Riots.

24:04.280 --> 24:05.645
<i>Police are pretty
much outnumbered</i>

24:05.720 --> 24:07.802
<i>as people are
turning to one another.</i>

24:07.880 --> 24:09.609
<i>Martial law has
now been declared.</i>

24:09.680 --> 24:11.170
<i>Air Force One has gone down...</i>

24:12.320 --> 24:15.210
Shit. It's gone, guys.

24:16.120 --> 24:19.442
So I think we should...

24:19.560 --> 24:22.643
I think we should probably
go back to your place, eh?

24:22.720 --> 24:24.131
What are you
talking about, man?

24:24.200 --> 24:27.409
No, no way.
I'm not leaving here.

24:27.480 --> 24:30.848
I don't want to die
at James Franco's house.

24:31.360 --> 24:32.805
You heard the TV.

24:32.880 --> 24:36.566
The TV said stay here.
It said stay in your homes.

24:36.640 --> 24:39.723
We need to stay here until they
start rescuing people, okay?

24:39.800 --> 24:42.326
A huge earthquake happens.
Who do they rescue first?

24:42.400 --> 24:43.811
- Actors.
- Famous people.

24:43.880 --> 24:46.360
They'll get Clooney,
Sandra Bullock, me.

24:46.440 --> 24:48.204
If there's room,
you guys'll come.

24:48.280 --> 24:50.640
The point is, is that we're all
gonna get out of this first.

24:51.560 --> 24:52.561
What the hell was that?

24:52.640 --> 24:54.005
It's already going
crazy out there, guys.

24:54.080 --> 24:57.323
We can't leave. I'm not leaving, okay?
I'm a victim.

24:57.400 --> 25:00.244
I've had a victim's mentality my whole life.
People can smell it on me.

25:00.320 --> 25:02.163
When I was a kid,
I had man-titties.

25:02.240 --> 25:03.924
The bullies held me down,
they tittie-fucked me.

25:04.000 --> 25:05.331
That's what's happening
out there right now.

25:05.440 --> 25:06.680
That's right, we are all soft.

25:06.760 --> 25:07.886
Yeah.
We are all soft!

25:07.960 --> 25:09.928
We are actors! We pretend
to be hard, man.

25:10.000 --> 25:11.843
Yeah.
We soft as baby shit.

25:11.920 --> 25:14.526
As baby shit, soft as... Wait,
Craig, what are you doing, man?

25:14.600 --> 25:17.080
Hey, hey, what are you doing? What
are you doing to the painting, man?

25:17.200 --> 25:18.804
We got to board this shit up, man.
Board it up?

25:18.880 --> 25:20.325
We got to protect ourselves.
We don't know

25:20.440 --> 25:22.124
how long we gonna be in here.
Okay, chill.

25:22.200 --> 25:23.406
There's raccoons, and
bandits, and shit out there.

25:23.480 --> 25:24.970
This is <i>Obey,</i> man!
If you get out the way!

25:25.040 --> 25:27.361
This is my favorite fucking painting!
What are you doing, Craig?

25:27.440 --> 25:28.441
Guys, help.

25:28.520 --> 25:30.363
Help. Help. Get off.

25:31.840 --> 25:33.046
Chill. Look.

25:33.120 --> 25:34.929
Helicopter!
Helicopter!

25:36.280 --> 25:40.046
The good guys are here. We're fine!
It's gonna be fine.

25:44.280 --> 25:45.770
God damn!

25:45.840 --> 25:47.763
Oh! God damn!

25:48.160 --> 25:49.605
Ow! Shit!

25:49.680 --> 25:50.681
You Okay?

25:50.760 --> 25:52.091
No, I'm not okay!

25:52.160 --> 25:54.288
Fuck your house, Franco!

25:54.400 --> 25:56.641
My house didn't do that! Aah!

25:57.680 --> 25:58.920
Ow.

26:02.160 --> 26:05.130
You don't got a tool kit or nothing?
Just a toolbox?

26:05.200 --> 26:06.565
I don't know.
Look in there.

26:10.240 --> 26:12.129
Where's the edge of this shit?

26:12.200 --> 26:14.328
Your thumb's
in my butthole, man.

26:14.640 --> 26:15.846
Whoa.

26:15.920 --> 26:17.570
Y'all need this dick?

26:17.680 --> 26:18.681
No, we're not using it.

26:18.760 --> 26:20.280
All right, I'm gonna
take it over here.

26:20.320 --> 26:22.687
Careful with that dick.
Damn.

26:26.000 --> 26:27.365
It's heavy.

26:28.000 --> 26:31.163
There it is, got that dick now.

26:31.240 --> 26:33.686
That dick is coming now.

26:34.200 --> 26:36.521
Yeah, got this big dick.

26:40.720 --> 26:42.165
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Hey, hey.

26:42.240 --> 26:43.810
What now?
Listen.

26:43.880 --> 26:46.929
Not the Rogen, all right?
Don't take him.

26:47.040 --> 26:48.087
Take me.

26:48.160 --> 26:51.607
We got 12 bottles of water,
56 beers, two vodkas,

26:51.680 --> 26:54.809
four whiskeys, six bottles
of wine, tequila, Nutella,

26:54.880 --> 26:58.566
cheese, pizza, eggs, bananas,
apples, bacon, steaks,

26:58.640 --> 27:02.565
pancake mix, CT Crunch,
milk, ketchup, a Milky Way,

27:02.680 --> 27:05.729
half ounce Sour Diesel, three and
a half grams Grand Master Kush,

27:05.800 --> 27:07.962
one ounce of 'shrooms,
15 pills of ecstasy,

27:08.040 --> 27:10.042
a porno mag, a baseball bat,

27:10.120 --> 27:12.487
and the video camera
from the movie <i>27 Hours.</i>

27:12.560 --> 27:14.050
<i>127 Hours.</i>

27:14.360 --> 27:15.805
Uh...

27:15.880 --> 27:17.689
<i>127 Hours.</i>

27:17.760 --> 27:20.969
And a functioning revolver
from the movie <i>Flyboys.</i>

27:21.040 --> 27:22.451
Old Faithful.

27:22.520 --> 27:23.851
Jesus.
Thing's real.

27:23.920 --> 27:25.729
No, I kept this from the movie.
Yeah.

27:25.800 --> 27:27.370
This is an actual revolver.
I see.

27:27.440 --> 27:28.487
Franco, that's
very uncomfortable.

27:28.560 --> 27:29.607
Could you put
that down, please?

27:29.680 --> 27:30.647
Loaded.

27:30.720 --> 27:32.131
Love it.
Awesome.

27:32.240 --> 27:33.924
Can you just put the gun away?
I always keep my props.

27:34.000 --> 27:36.048
That's really cool.
Always keep my props.

27:36.120 --> 27:37.201
I know how to handle it.

27:37.280 --> 27:38.805
He knows what he's doing.
I like this bit.

27:38.880 --> 27:40.291
I like it. I get it. Let me see.

27:40.360 --> 27:42.328
It's real. It's heavy.
Let me see it like that.

27:42.400 --> 27:44.004
- God damn!
- Come on, guys!

27:44.080 --> 27:45.161
- You could kill...
- Careful.

27:45.240 --> 27:46.321
- Bang, bang!
- Jesus!

27:46.400 --> 27:47.731
Please, put it down!
Oh, fuck!

27:47.800 --> 27:49.848
Bang, bang, bang.
You're dead.

27:49.960 --> 27:52.008
I hope you're fucking happy.
Pow, pow, pow.

27:52.080 --> 27:53.764
Stop... Guys, stop
fucking with the gun.

27:53.840 --> 27:55.365
Jesus! Jesus!
Pow, pow.

27:55.440 --> 27:56.441
It's a real gun!
Bang.

27:56.520 --> 27:57.521
It's so funny.
It's so funny.

27:57.600 --> 27:59.080
- Guys, it's funny.
- It's not funny!

27:59.120 --> 28:00.531
We're getting sidetracked.

28:00.600 --> 28:01.886
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

28:01.960 --> 28:03.371
- I'll just kill myself.
- No!

28:03.440 --> 28:04.601
- Don't do that, Jonah!
- Jesus.

28:04.680 --> 28:05.681
Oh, no.
Jonah, give it back.

28:05.760 --> 28:07.400
I don't know! I don't know.
Don't do that.

28:07.440 --> 28:09.204
Jonah.
I'm so...

28:09.280 --> 28:11.044
- Oh, my God. Hey.
- Oh, dude.

28:11.120 --> 28:12.610
Come on, no, no.
Don't. Jesus!

28:12.640 --> 28:14.210
Would you put the thing down?
The whole...

28:14.280 --> 28:15.566
I'm trying to
have some fun, man.

28:15.640 --> 28:17.324
Okay, okay, Jesus.

28:17.400 --> 28:19.562
Look, just because a bunch
of people fell into a hole outside

28:19.640 --> 28:21.040
doesn't mean we can't
have some fun.

28:21.080 --> 28:23.731
We're a bunch of best friends hanging out.
It's like a sleepover.

28:23.800 --> 28:26.167
Okay, food. How are we
gonna deal with this?

28:27.000 --> 28:28.047
Um...

28:28.120 --> 28:29.326
Can I have that Milky Way?

28:29.400 --> 28:30.845
No, you can't have
the Milky Way.

28:30.960 --> 28:32.086
That's my Milky Way.
There's a bunch... What?

28:32.160 --> 28:33.571
I went out this morning,

28:33.640 --> 28:36.723
specifically bought this Milky
Way to eat after my party.

28:36.800 --> 28:37.801
That's weird.

28:37.880 --> 28:39.325
It's not weird.
It's my special food.

28:39.400 --> 28:41.050
I like it. Back me
up on that, Seth.

28:41.120 --> 28:42.406
I don't think you should get
the whole Milky Way.

28:42.480 --> 28:43.527
I want some of the Milky Way.

28:43.600 --> 28:46.331
I'd be pretty bummed if I don't at
least get a bite of the Milky Way.

28:46.400 --> 28:47.447
Oh! Now Craig wants
a bite of the Milky Way.

28:47.520 --> 28:50.000
Yeah, I want a bite of the Milky Way.
It's a fucking Milky Way.

28:50.040 --> 28:52.725
A fifth of everything is
what's fair and reasonable.

28:52.800 --> 28:54.609
Everyone gets
a fifth of everything.

28:54.680 --> 28:56.250
I want one-fifth
of your T-shirt!

28:56.320 --> 28:58.084
I want the bottom part,
the belly.

28:58.160 --> 28:59.605
I'm not sporting
a crop top in your house.

28:59.680 --> 29:01.250
I'll cut that shit off
and make a headband.

29:01.320 --> 29:03.049
You couldn't handle my midriff.

29:03.120 --> 29:05.964
Guys, the only issue is,
I kind of need the Milky Way.

29:06.040 --> 29:07.201
For fuck's sake.

29:07.280 --> 29:08.611
No, for real,
I have low blood sugar,

29:08.680 --> 29:09.681
and if my endorphins
drop too low,

29:09.760 --> 29:10.761
I'm gonna be
a nightmare to be around.

29:10.840 --> 29:12.763
What? Your LBS starts acting up,

29:12.840 --> 29:14.808
you can have a finger
scoop of Nutella, okay?

29:14.880 --> 29:17.281
One finger scoop of Nutella.
Fair.

29:17.400 --> 29:19.004
I'm going to bed.

29:19.080 --> 29:20.525
Jesus fucking...

29:20.600 --> 29:22.170
Don't touch that
Milky Way, Jonah.

29:22.280 --> 29:23.566
Night, James.

29:28.360 --> 29:30.931
Oh, God, no!

29:31.760 --> 29:33.091
Fuck.

30:01.880 --> 30:04.326
Hey.
Hey.

30:04.800 --> 30:06.245
I'm gonna sleep with you.

30:06.280 --> 30:07.645
What? I'm gonna sleep with you.

30:07.720 --> 30:08.767
It's too scary to sleep alone.

30:08.840 --> 30:09.880
But this is my little area.

30:09.920 --> 30:11.570
Well, I'm invading
your little area.

30:11.640 --> 30:14.564
I'm sorry, but I'm
too scared, okay?

30:14.640 --> 30:15.641
Are you mad at me, man?

30:15.720 --> 30:17.484
If I was pissed at you,

30:17.560 --> 30:19.801
I'm sure it would
have something to do

30:19.920 --> 30:21.490
with the fact that
I had no interest

30:21.560 --> 30:24.564
in coming to
this house socially,

30:24.640 --> 30:27.484
and now,
I am barricaded in here

30:27.560 --> 30:30.530
with a bunch of people
that I really hate.

30:30.920 --> 30:32.684
Maybe this was meant to be.

30:32.760 --> 30:36.003
Maybe this horrible, horrible,
deadly earthquake happened

30:36.080 --> 30:38.367
so we could become closer
as a group of friends.

30:38.480 --> 30:42.041
I don't need a group. I'm like DMX, man.
I'm a lone wolf.

30:42.120 --> 30:43.610
DMX isn't a lone wolf.

30:44.040 --> 30:45.769
DMX has the Ruff Ryder crew.

30:45.840 --> 30:48.127
You can't stop, drop,
and open up shop alone.

30:48.240 --> 30:52.370
You need people to help you in an
earthquake disastery situation.

30:52.440 --> 30:56.365
It was something else.
It was Judgment Day.

30:56.440 --> 30:57.805
Like <i>Terminator 2?</i>

30:57.880 --> 31:00.167
No, not like <i>Terminator 2.</i>
For God's sakes.

31:00.240 --> 31:02.049
Like Skynet?
You think this is Skynet?

31:02.120 --> 31:03.360
Like, Skynet went live?
No.

31:03.440 --> 31:05.204
Will you please
stop saying "Skynet"?

31:05.280 --> 31:07.408
Well, you're the one
that said Judgment Day.

31:07.480 --> 31:09.084
The biblical Judgment Day.

31:10.400 --> 31:12.209
What? That's crazy. It's just...

31:12.280 --> 31:13.486
You fucking heathen.

31:13.600 --> 31:14.601
Okay, here's the thing.

31:14.680 --> 31:16.921
Let's say for a second
there was blue light

31:17.000 --> 31:18.570
sucking people up into the sky.

31:18.640 --> 31:22.122
That means that we were not
awesome enough to go to heaven.

31:22.480 --> 31:24.562
Shit! Shit.

31:29.320 --> 31:31.084
What y'all doing?

31:31.800 --> 31:32.926
Fuck you, Craig.

31:33.000 --> 31:34.843
I'm scared.
It's scary by myself.

31:34.920 --> 31:36.570
It's way better
with more people.

31:36.960 --> 31:38.007
I'm gonna come down here.

31:38.080 --> 31:40.526
Oh, yeah, good, yeah.
Get in here, man.

31:40.600 --> 31:41.567
Get right in there.

31:41.640 --> 31:43.244
So, you're gonna...

31:43.320 --> 31:44.731
Right here.
Right here.

31:44.840 --> 31:47.446
I feel better, actually.
I like that.

31:49.080 --> 31:50.844
It's better with more people.

31:50.920 --> 31:51.921
Hey, guys...

31:52.000 --> 31:54.082
- Jesus Christ.
- Jesus!

31:54.160 --> 31:56.640
Sorry. Franco has this
crazy open floor plan.

31:56.720 --> 31:58.643
I can hear every word
you guys are saying.

31:58.720 --> 32:01.041
I might as well hang with
you guys if that's cool.

32:01.120 --> 32:02.770
Nice.
Coming in hot.

32:02.840 --> 32:04.444
I gonna grab
a blanket from you.

32:04.520 --> 32:05.851
Give me that blanket.

32:05.920 --> 32:07.684
Get in the middle of it.
That's good.

32:07.760 --> 32:10.001
That's it. It feels so
much more safe now, guys.

32:10.080 --> 32:11.241
It's nice here.

32:11.320 --> 32:12.685
Should we spoon it?
Yeah, you want to?

32:12.760 --> 32:13.886
No!
Want to go...

32:13.960 --> 32:14.961
Dick to butt?
No.

32:15.040 --> 32:16.161
My butt to you and then Jay.

32:16.200 --> 32:18.043
I don't want to butt
to dick to anything.

32:18.120 --> 32:19.360
Are you docking into me?
You're doing tip to me?

32:19.440 --> 32:20.441
Or what are you doing?

32:20.520 --> 32:21.601
Should we go butt to
butt or dick to...

32:21.680 --> 32:22.681
Seth and I are
gonna go ass to ass.

32:22.760 --> 32:23.966
Do you want to go
front to front?

32:24.040 --> 32:26.122
No, I'm fine
just going dicks up.

32:26.200 --> 32:27.281
Dicks up?

32:27.360 --> 32:28.850
I think I'm going dick to ass.
You know what?

32:28.920 --> 32:30.968
I'm going
<i>Scarface</i>-style.

32:31.040 --> 32:32.280
Both of you guys.
Wait, yeah.

32:32.360 --> 32:33.521
There we go.
Yeah.

32:33.600 --> 32:34.647
This is the best way.

32:34.720 --> 32:35.801
Good night, boys.

32:35.880 --> 32:38.247
Good night.
Good night.

32:38.320 --> 32:39.560
Good night, guys.

32:39.640 --> 32:41.369
Night, my sweet guys.
Good night.

32:41.480 --> 32:42.601

Franco!
Good morning, sunshine.

34:04.720 --> 34:05.960
Guys! Guys! Wake up!

34:06.040 --> 34:08.850
Danny's alive! He's eating
all the fucking food!

34:08.920 --> 34:10.888
No!
Danny, man, don't.

34:11.600 --> 34:12.806
Danny!

34:13.639 --> 34:15.927
No, it's cool, man. I fucking
made this for you guys.

34:16.000 --> 34:17.001
Stop eating!

34:17.080 --> 34:18.206
Don't eat another
piece of bacon.

34:18.280 --> 34:19.406
Guys, just chill
the fuck out, okay?

34:19.480 --> 34:22.449
I'm sure the Green Goblin can
fucking afford some more bacon.

34:22.520 --> 34:24.806
Dude, that shit's supposed to
last us till we get rescued!

34:25.280 --> 34:28.329
Wait a second.
I know what happened.

34:28.400 --> 34:31.005
You guys dropped acid,
didn't you? Mmm-hmm.

34:31.239 --> 34:33.320
Craig doesn't have any pants on.
He got fucking wild.

34:33.360 --> 34:35.806
Probably danced, sweated
all over the place.

34:35.880 --> 34:37.166
You got white shit all
over your mouth, Franco.

34:37.239 --> 34:38.525
You probably sucked
somebody's dick.

34:38.600 --> 34:41.409
Jonah over here probably
watched and jerked off.

34:41.480 --> 34:43.641
Jay, I didn't even know you were in town.
Good to see you.

34:43.719 --> 34:46.087
Danny, we're not on acid. We
didn't suck each other's dicks!

34:46.159 --> 34:48.891
James Franco didn't suck
any dick last night?

34:48.960 --> 34:50.530
Now I know y'all are tripping.

34:50.600 --> 34:52.443
You actually not know
what happened last night?

34:52.520 --> 34:55.091
Daniel, you may want to
stay seated for a second.

34:55.159 --> 34:57.049
Some really
messed-up stuff happened,

34:57.120 --> 34:59.361
and there were
a lot of fatalities.

34:59.440 --> 35:02.125
Oh, really? You're putting
your serious voice on, Jonah?

35:02.200 --> 35:04.601
Okay, tell me about
these "fatalities."

35:04.680 --> 35:07.763
Dude, Segel's dead, Krumholtz
is dead, Michael Cera's dead.

35:07.840 --> 35:11.526
Guess if Michael Cera's gone, it's
not a total loss, huh?

35:11.600 --> 35:13.125
Jesus, Danny.
Michael Cera's dead.

35:13.200 --> 35:14.929
What?
It's not like that.

35:15.000 --> 35:16.684
It's not funny, man.
It's really not funny.

35:16.800 --> 35:17.801
Seth, that's
a better performance

35:17.880 --> 35:19.450
than you've given in
your last six movies.

35:19.520 --> 35:21.280
Where the fuck was that
in Green Hornet, huh?

35:21.320 --> 35:23.163
Jonah, you're fucking
sucking balls.

35:23.240 --> 35:24.844
You're an Academy Award
nominated person.

35:24.920 --> 35:27.287
You need to be fucking
selling that shit, dude.

35:27.360 --> 35:29.561
"Fatalities.
There were some fatalities."

35:30.120 --> 35:31.167
Fatalities.

35:32.040 --> 35:33.724
Okay, now that was good.
That was good.

35:33.800 --> 35:35.802
Does it seem like
we're fucking joking?

35:35.880 --> 35:38.451
Hey, hey, hey! What the
fuck you eating, man?

35:38.560 --> 35:41.370
Spit it out your mouth. Give me the bacon!

35:47.800 --> 35:49.040
Shit.

35:49.880 --> 35:51.211
Shit, what do we do?

35:51.280 --> 35:53.123
Shoot 'em!
Shoot 'em! Shoot 'em!

35:58.080 --> 35:59.127
Should I shoot?

35:59.240 --> 36:01.288
- Shut up, Franco!
- Shoot the door, Franco!

36:01.960 --> 36:03.007
Oh, God!

36:03.080 --> 36:05.686
Did you not hear me knocking out here?
I've been knocking forever.

36:05.760 --> 36:07.649
Please! Please!
You've got to let me in!

36:08.680 --> 36:10.842
Hang on a second.
What?

36:10.920 --> 36:13.400
Guys, I know
it sounds really weird,

36:13.480 --> 36:15.926
but I don't think
we should let him in.

36:16.200 --> 36:17.167
Why not?

36:17.240 --> 36:18.969
Yeah, why not? I can
hear you, by the way.

36:19.040 --> 36:20.690
I'm sorry. We just
don't know you, man.

36:20.760 --> 36:24.207
You could be like, a looter, or
a rapist, or a tittie-fucker.

36:24.280 --> 36:25.611
Like, I'm sorry.

36:25.680 --> 36:28.524
Look, guys, we just boarded up this
whole house to keep everyone out,

36:28.600 --> 36:31.171
and the first guy comes to the
door, we're gonna let him in?

36:31.240 --> 36:32.765
I mean, how do we know
we can trust this guy?

36:32.840 --> 36:35.605
I want to live! Things
have gone crazy out here!

36:35.680 --> 36:38.923
"Fucking crazy
out here!" This guy fucking sucks.

36:39.000 --> 36:40.047
What if he's the rapist?

36:40.120 --> 36:41.246
Man, even if he is a rapist,

36:41.320 --> 36:43.129
he can't rape all of us.
Yeah! No! So I'm not...

36:43.200 --> 36:44.804
I'm not a rapist! You
want to tittie-fuck us?

36:44.880 --> 36:47.645
If you want me to tittie-fuck you, I will!
So good! You'll love it.

36:47.720 --> 36:49.006
Seth, back me up, please.

36:49.080 --> 36:51.401
We can't just leave him out there to die.
Are you crazy?

36:51.520 --> 36:53.488
What do you want to do? I'll
do whatever you want to do.

36:53.560 --> 36:54.641
Let's vote on it.

36:54.720 --> 36:56.529
Yeah, I fucking
vote you let me in.

36:56.600 --> 36:58.045
Here's my vote.
Fuck all of you.

36:58.120 --> 36:59.610
I'm letting him in.
This is boring.

37:00.480 --> 37:01.561
There's something out here!

37:07.640 --> 37:09.722
This is real!
This is fucking real!

37:10.400 --> 37:11.561
God damn it!

37:25.400 --> 37:26.845
You guys!

37:26.920 --> 37:28.360
This man was alive
a few seconds ago.

37:28.400 --> 37:29.925
We can't play soccer
with his head!

37:30.000 --> 37:31.365
Pick it up, Jonah!

37:33.000 --> 37:34.411
What the fuck is going on?

37:34.520 --> 37:36.090
He blinked at me.

37:36.160 --> 37:38.288
He blinked at my face.
Seth, put it over there.

37:39.680 --> 37:40.886
Oh, my God!

37:40.960 --> 37:42.200
I got it.
I got it, guys.

37:42.320 --> 37:44.687
There's blood
all over my floor!

37:44.760 --> 37:46.091
Time to relax for a second.

37:46.200 --> 37:48.965
Okay, someone should
look out the hole.

37:49.040 --> 37:50.121
I ain't looking out that hole!

37:50.200 --> 37:52.248
Last person looked through that
hole got his head chopped off!

37:52.320 --> 37:56.530
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Whatever is
out there might still be out there.

37:58.520 --> 38:00.920
Okay, I know, I know.
Come on. Come on. Come on.

38:01.840 --> 38:05.049
Oh, God.
Oh, God. Oh, God.

38:06.680 --> 38:08.364
There's a lookout!

38:14.200 --> 38:16.328
Jesus Christ! Look, there's a
huge fucking hole down there!

38:16.400 --> 38:18.209
What the fuck is this?

38:18.880 --> 38:20.360
Where's the thing
that killed the guy?

38:20.400 --> 38:21.481
I don't know.

38:21.560 --> 38:22.721
How'd his head fall off?

38:22.800 --> 38:24.040
And where's the rest of him?

38:30.600 --> 38:31.886
<i>Hi.</i>

38:31.960 --> 38:33.644
<i>This is James Franco,</i>

38:35.360 --> 38:37.840
<i>in my house, in my library.</i>

38:37.960 --> 38:41.362
<i>We've been stuck here
for about 24 hours.</i>

38:41.440 --> 38:43.841
<i>Danny McBride is here.</i>

38:43.920 --> 38:45.360
<i>I didn't even
invite him to my party,</i>

38:45.400 --> 38:48.006
<i>but he came and passed
out in the bathtub,</i>

38:48.080 --> 38:51.163
<i>and I got to say it's, like,
typical fucking McBride.</i>

38:51.240 --> 38:55.370
<i>Like, I've been feeling really
weird about him lately.</i>

38:55.440 --> 38:58.444
<i>Like, I don't really know if I
want to be friends with him,</i>

38:58.520 --> 39:02.366
<i>and then he fucking
showed up at my party,</i>

39:02.440 --> 39:07.048
<i>and now, we're stuck here with
him in disaster lockdown, so...</i>

39:10.280 --> 39:11.566
<i>What up?
What's going on?</i>

39:11.640 --> 39:13.051
<i>Hey, Danny.
What's up, man?</i>

39:13.160 --> 39:15.640
<i>Not much. What are you doing'?
What is this?</i>

39:15.720 --> 39:18.200
<i>Oh, it's just
a video confessional.</i>

39:24.760 --> 39:26.285
<i>Fuck that dude.</i>

39:27.040 --> 39:28.804
- Earthquakes cause tsunamis.
- Yes.

39:28.880 --> 39:31.281
Tsunamis cause
other tsunamis, disaster.

39:31.360 --> 39:33.362
I mean, for all we know, the fucking
Lakers could have just won,

39:33.440 --> 39:34.851
and that's the reason
why all this is happening.

39:34.920 --> 39:36.888
Hole in Franco's front yard?
Sinkhole.

39:36.960 --> 39:40.328
Every single time I turn on the
news, sinkhole in South America.

39:40.440 --> 39:42.044
Bunch of South Americans getting
sucked into the ground.

39:42.120 --> 39:43.565
Sinkhole de Mayo.
Sinkhole de Mayo.

39:43.640 --> 39:44.721
That's why it's named that,

39:44.760 --> 39:46.364
because sinkholes happen
in the summertime.

39:46.440 --> 39:50.445
It's not wildfires. It's not earthquakes.
It's not sinkholes.

39:50.520 --> 39:51.646
I think I know what it is.

39:51.720 --> 39:52.721
Let's hear it.

39:53.640 --> 39:55.927
I think it's the Apocalypse.

39:56.240 --> 39:57.480
What?

39:59.080 --> 40:03.369
I'm serious, boys. It's all in
here, in the Book of Revelations.

40:03.440 --> 40:04.407
You took my Bible?

40:04.480 --> 40:05.481
Well, just hear me out,

40:05.560 --> 40:06.800
and you tell me that
what I'm describing

40:06.880 --> 40:09.645
isn't what's going on right now.

40:10.040 --> 40:13.408
"And the skies shall open up, and the
light of the Lord shall shine down,"

40:13.480 --> 40:16.245
"and those of good heart shall be
brought into my kingdom of heaven."

40:16.320 --> 40:20.723
That's the Rapture, those are the
gigantic beams of blue light.

40:20.800 --> 40:23.121
"And there will be a great
mountain burning in fire."

40:23.200 --> 40:26.647
I mean, the Hollywood Hills are
literally engulfed in flames

40:26.720 --> 40:28.131
as we sit here right now.

40:28.200 --> 40:30.771
The Hollywood Hills ain't no mountain.
It's a hill.

40:30.840 --> 40:32.046
Takes about 10 minutes
to get across

40:32.120 --> 40:33.281
that motherfucker
with no traffic.

40:33.360 --> 40:34.600
Coldwater.
I take Laurel Canyon.

40:34.640 --> 40:35.607
Cahuenga.
Cahuenga.

40:35.680 --> 40:37.569
I usually zip down Barham. Boys,
can I just fucking finish?

40:37.640 --> 40:38.926
I love Laurel Canyon.

40:39.040 --> 40:42.840
"And out of the pit rose a great
red dragon having seven heads,"

40:42.960 --> 40:45.691
"that old serpent
called the devil and Satan,"

40:45.760 --> 40:48.650
"which deceiveth
the whole world,"

40:48.720 --> 40:51.291
"was released
onto the earth."

40:52.160 --> 40:54.561
I love that dude. He's from
<i>Where the Wild Things Are.</i>

40:54.680 --> 40:55.681
It's a load of bullshit.

40:55.760 --> 40:56.807
It's not bullshit.

40:56.880 --> 40:58.166
Want to know
something else, Jay?

40:58.240 --> 40:59.321
If this is
the end of the world,

40:59.400 --> 41:01.004
and all the good people died,

41:01.080 --> 41:05.290
what you're saying is Seth,
me, Jonah, Craig and Danny

41:05.400 --> 41:06.401
are a bunch of assholes.

41:06.480 --> 41:08.642
I'm straight-up
lovable, son.

41:08.720 --> 41:12.486
And if this really
is the Apocalypse,

41:12.560 --> 41:13.607
you're here, too.

41:14.240 --> 41:17.562
So, that means you're just
as shitty as the rest of us.

41:18.440 --> 41:19.771
Doesn't feel too good, does it?

41:30.240 --> 41:32.846
Hey, guys.
I'm going to sleep now.

41:32.920 --> 41:34.285
Nobody come in here
and bother me.

41:34.920 --> 41:35.921
Go fish.

41:36.000 --> 41:37.684
Put it back inside of here.

41:37.760 --> 41:39.683
Do you know what it is? Yeah.

41:39.760 --> 41:41.967
Now you ask me for
something that you need.

41:42.040 --> 41:43.451
First bit.

41:43.560 --> 41:44.846
You're not cutting it all?

41:44.920 --> 41:47.651
That's smart. You're
divvying it up first.

41:47.920 --> 41:49.763
This is like, Fruyere or some shit.
That's me.

41:49.840 --> 41:50.887
Come on, Danny!

41:50.920 --> 41:52.360
You licked your finger.
Come on, man.

41:53.200 --> 41:54.531
If they're all
equal, what does it matter?

41:54.600 --> 41:55.965
Keep your hands
and fingers off.

41:56.040 --> 41:57.007
Seth?
Yeah.

41:57.080 --> 41:58.809
Can I talk to you for a second?
Yeah, yeah.

41:58.880 --> 42:00.291
Yeah, no shit.

42:02.960 --> 42:05.167
Here.
Off the menu, my man.

42:06.440 --> 42:08.522
Holy shit, man.
Where did you get these?

42:08.600 --> 42:12.127
Hey, what's cheese without a few crackers?
Know what I'm saying?

42:12.200 --> 42:14.089
Hide it.
Okay.

42:16.280 --> 42:17.725
'Cause we're a team.

42:17.800 --> 42:18.881
Okay.

42:18.960 --> 42:20.849
Freaks forever, brother.

42:22.160 --> 42:24.128
Let's do all the drugs.

42:24.200 --> 42:26.043
I don't really want to.

42:26.120 --> 42:28.761
Should have thought of that before
you drank a can full of ecstasy.

44:20.400 --> 44:22.801
<i>I smoked weed with Steve Jobs,</i>

44:22.880 --> 44:25.121
<i>and that's when he
came up with the iPad.</i>

44:25.720 --> 44:27.404
<i>It's pretty great.</i>

44:27.480 --> 44:29.240
We should make sequels
to more of our movies.

44:29.280 --> 44:30.327
Yeah!

44:30.400 --> 44:32.004
How 'bout we not
do <i>Your Highness 2?</i>

44:32.080 --> 44:33.605
Yeah.
Do <i>128 Hours.</i>

44:33.680 --> 44:36.001
The beginning of the rest of
your comedies. Looks good.

44:39.840 --> 44:41.285
Oh, my God!

44:48.760 --> 44:50.046
Emma!
It's Emma.

44:50.120 --> 44:52.646
Oh, my God, you guys are alive.

44:52.720 --> 44:55.007
You're actually alive.
Thank God!

44:55.080 --> 44:57.845
I hid in a drainpipe for days.

44:57.920 --> 45:00.810
Like, three or four.
I don't even know how many.

45:00.880 --> 45:02.370
And then I stopped
hearing people,

45:02.440 --> 45:04.124
and I started hearing
growling noises.

45:04.200 --> 45:07.602
Out there, in your travels, uh,

45:07.680 --> 45:08.966
did you see anything
that you would describe

45:09.040 --> 45:10.565
as Apocalyptish?

45:10.640 --> 45:12.369
I mean, no,

45:12.480 --> 45:17.247
but, uh, I would say it's completely
obvious what's going on here.

45:17.360 --> 45:19.886
I mean, it's a zombie invasion.

45:19.960 --> 45:21.610
Fuck! DANNY: I'm the one who
said it's been zombies.

45:21.720 --> 45:23.449
You said zombies? I said
zombies the whole time.

45:23.560 --> 45:25.841
You said zombies? I don't think...
You never said zombies.

45:25.880 --> 45:27.928
Wait a second. You guys
haven't been proven right.

45:28.000 --> 45:29.240
These are still just theories.

45:29.320 --> 45:31.891
Honestly, I'm just so relieved
that you guys are here,

45:31.960 --> 45:35.009
and I'm very happy about the
idea of sleeping and just...

45:35.080 --> 45:36.081
You tired?
Yeah.

45:36.160 --> 45:38.925
If you want to
take a little rest,

45:39.000 --> 45:41.002
you're welcome to
do that upstairs.

45:41.080 --> 45:42.366
Thank you.
Cool.

45:42.440 --> 45:44.010
- I'll show you the way.
- Thank you.

45:44.080 --> 45:46.003
Thanks, guys. Seriously,
you're awesome, really.

45:46.080 --> 45:47.650
You're awesome.

45:48.280 --> 45:49.486
So fucking tight.

45:49.600 --> 45:51.841
We'll be right out here, okay?

45:53.320 --> 45:54.401
Fuck are you
guys doing out here?

45:54.520 --> 45:56.727
Here's what I think we should do.
She's British, right?

45:56.800 --> 45:58.529
She's used to eating
shitty food anyway.

45:58.600 --> 46:00.489
Let's just give her all the
shitty food that we don't want.

46:00.560 --> 46:02.085
That's fucked up.
Look how tiny she is.

46:02.160 --> 46:04.083
She's not even a full seven.
She's, like, halfa seven.

46:04.160 --> 46:05.481
This is a fucking
cool thing, man.

46:05.520 --> 46:06.851
I, for one, am very excited.

46:06.920 --> 46:08.763
I'm a massive <i>Harry Potter</i> fan.

46:08.840 --> 46:10.922
What? Yes. I love
fucking <i>Harry Potter.</i>

46:11.000 --> 46:12.445
I cannot wait till she wakes up

46:12.520 --> 46:14.204
and I can ask her all these
amazing questions about

46:14.280 --> 46:15.486
how they made
those motion pictures.

46:15.560 --> 46:16.607
Take it easy, Dumbledore.

46:16.680 --> 46:19.570
Guys, listen, listen.
I think we need to

46:19.640 --> 46:21.369
address the elephant
in the room.

46:21.440 --> 46:23.204
Whoa. Jay, don't talk
about Craig like that.

46:23.280 --> 46:24.850
That's fucked up. I'm
right here, man. Yeah.

46:24.920 --> 46:27.048
I'm not calling
Craig an elephant.

46:27.120 --> 46:29.160
Wow, that's fucking weird.
What does that even mean?

46:29.200 --> 46:30.440
Yeah, no.
That's racist.

46:30.520 --> 46:31.646
I wasn't referring to him.

46:31.720 --> 46:35.122
I was referring to the issue
that's on all of our minds.

46:35.200 --> 46:36.486
What?

46:36.560 --> 46:39.882
This is one girl
in a house with six males.

46:39.960 --> 46:41.121
Yeah. Really safe.

46:41.200 --> 46:42.326
Ideal scenario.

46:42.400 --> 46:43.481
She's like a little sister.

46:43.560 --> 46:45.005
I think that she needs...

46:45.080 --> 46:46.809
It's important
that she feels safe.

46:46.880 --> 46:48.370
Yeah.
And comfortable.

46:48.440 --> 46:49.805
And we should be mindful.

46:49.880 --> 46:51.211
Who's making her not feel safe?

46:51.280 --> 46:52.725
Well, I'm just saying,
we should...

46:52.800 --> 46:55.167
We don't want to
give off a bad vibe.

46:55.240 --> 46:56.765
Vibe? Vibes? I ain't
giving no vibes.

46:56.840 --> 46:58.490
Yeah, wait, what kind of vibes
are you talking about, man?

46:58.560 --> 47:00.449
He's talking about us
giving off a rapey vibe.

47:00.520 --> 47:02.124
- Hey! Shh!
- Whoa! What?

47:02.240 --> 47:04.049
Jesus. Jay, what the fuck, man?

47:04.120 --> 47:05.281
Chill out, dude.

47:05.360 --> 47:07.249
Why you putting that
shit in the mix? Yeah.

47:07.320 --> 47:09.084
He fucking said it.
You're the one saying it.

47:09.160 --> 47:10.571
No one here is thinking
about raping anyone.

47:10.640 --> 47:12.290
Shh! Well, you
talking about vibes

47:12.360 --> 47:15.204
is the only thing that's
rapey going on right now.

47:15.280 --> 47:17.203
Dude, nothing was rapey till you
brought up the rapey vibes.

47:17.280 --> 47:19.282
Fucking one who smelt it dealt it, dawg.
True that, dude.

47:19.360 --> 47:20.771
One who denies it supplies it.

47:20.840 --> 47:22.842
I know, it's farts, I get it.

47:22.920 --> 47:24.081
Guys, guys, guys.

47:24.160 --> 47:25.764
Jay's not rapey.

47:26.200 --> 47:27.281
Jay couldn't rape a fly.

47:27.360 --> 47:29.089
He probably could.

47:29.200 --> 47:31.043
Maybe we should just stop this
entire conversation right now.

47:31.160 --> 47:32.844
If anyone's gonna
rape anyone here,

47:32.920 --> 47:34.251
it's probably gonna be Danny.

47:34.320 --> 47:35.731
What the fuck, Franco?
What?

47:35.800 --> 47:37.211
Why do you think
I'm gonna rape somebody?

47:37.280 --> 47:39.169
I'm just trying
to lay it out there.

47:39.240 --> 47:40.605
I'm not gonna
rape anyone, all right?

47:40.680 --> 47:41.966
If anyone's gonna
rape somebody, it's Jay.

47:42.000 --> 47:43.604
What? He came
up with the rape idea.

47:43.680 --> 47:44.886
And his face looks
like the police sketch

47:44.960 --> 47:46.120
- of a fucking rapist.
- True.

47:46.160 --> 47:47.366
What the fuck does that mean?

47:47.440 --> 47:49.044
If anybody's
raping Emma Watson,

47:49.120 --> 47:50.246
it's fucking Sir
Rapes-a-Lot over here.

47:50.360 --> 47:51.441
- Chill out.
- Hey!

47:51.680 --> 47:52.806
Whoa!

47:52.880 --> 47:53.881
Easy. Easy.

47:53.960 --> 47:55.041
Back the fuck up!

47:55.120 --> 47:56.406
Emma.
What's wrong?

47:56.480 --> 47:57.561
Wait, what's wrong?
What's wrong?

47:57.640 --> 47:58.766
I just heard
you guys talking about

47:58.840 --> 48:00.330
which one of you is
gonna get to rape me.

48:00.400 --> 48:01.811
No, no, no, no!

48:01.880 --> 48:03.325
Guys, I got it.
I got it.

48:03.440 --> 48:05.681
No. It's funny.
It's funny.

48:05.760 --> 48:07.720
We were specifically talking
about not raping you.

48:08.960 --> 48:10.086
Jesus!
Holy shit!

48:10.160 --> 48:11.924
Back up!

48:12.480 --> 48:13.970
It's me, Jonah!

48:14.040 --> 48:15.530
It's me, Jonah Hill.

48:15.600 --> 48:18.171
America's sweetheart.
J-bug, J-bone.

48:18.280 --> 48:20.081
Your friend. I would never hurt you.
Get back!

48:21.720 --> 48:23.722
Give me everything you have to drink!
Put it in the bag!

48:23.800 --> 48:25.609
There's six of us.
You cannot rob us!

48:25.680 --> 48:26.920
I'm not fucking around!

48:28.200 --> 48:29.690
Give her drinks!
Give her drinks!

48:29.800 --> 48:31.165
Put the drinks in a bag!

48:31.200 --> 48:33.282
Oh, God. Get all the
drinks in a bag!

48:33.360 --> 48:34.691
Hurry the fuck up!

48:34.760 --> 48:35.966
Okay, they're getting
the drinks.

48:36.040 --> 48:38.088
Put the ax down. Don't
give the Milky Way away.

48:38.160 --> 48:40.083
All right, you can
put the ax down now.

48:40.160 --> 48:41.241
Now, Franco!
Shoot her face!

48:41.320 --> 48:42.446
Shoot her!

48:42.520 --> 48:44.090
I'm not gonna
shoot Emma Watson!

48:44.160 --> 48:45.810
Look, Emma, just
stay here with us.

48:45.880 --> 48:47.530
It's a lot safer
than out there.

48:53.640 --> 48:56.120
<i>Hermione just stole
all of our shit.</i>

48:56.200 --> 48:59.886
<i>Little bitty-ass
20-year-old jacked us.</i>

48:59.960 --> 49:03.282
<i>And then Jay suggested that we
all rape her, and now she's gone.</i>

49:03.360 --> 49:05.681
<i>I didn't...
I was just... I...</i>

49:05.760 --> 49:08.889
<i>I think the only reason why he
did that is because Jay knows</i>

49:08.960 --> 49:10.371
<i>he's about fucking
two minutes away</i>

49:10.440 --> 49:12.044
<i>from becoming
the house bitch himself.</i>

49:12.120 --> 49:16.045
<i>So now,
motherfuckers is thirsty.</i>

49:16.400 --> 49:18.129
All right, guys.

49:18.200 --> 49:19.964
The door to the
basement's out there,

49:20.040 --> 49:21.451
around the side of the house.

49:21.560 --> 49:24.848
I know for sure there's at
least two jugs of water.

49:24.920 --> 49:26.410
Okay.

49:26.480 --> 49:27.481
Uh...

49:28.360 --> 49:29.646
Any volunteers?

49:29.720 --> 49:31.521
Does anyone want to
volunteer and go with Jay?

49:31.600 --> 49:32.647
What?

49:32.720 --> 49:34.643
I thought you said, "Someone
volunteer to go with me out there."

49:34.720 --> 49:35.721
I must have misheard you.

49:35.840 --> 49:37.763
I'm sorry. You did
not, you motherfucker.

49:37.840 --> 49:39.251
Hey, okay, ease up.

49:39.320 --> 49:41.891
Just chill out, dude.
Just relax, man. God.

49:41.960 --> 49:43.803
So how we gonna
decide this, fellas?

49:43.880 --> 49:46.281
All right, guys, it's simple.

49:46.360 --> 49:49.762
Whoever pulls the burnt match
has to go get the water.

49:58.000 --> 50:00.924
Who wants to go first?

50:01.960 --> 50:03.200
I'll do it.

50:03.280 --> 50:04.406
Craig.

50:04.520 --> 50:06.090
All right.

50:07.080 --> 50:08.525
Go ahead, brother.

50:15.360 --> 50:16.771
No whammies, no whammies.

50:16.840 --> 50:19.605
- Hey, hey.
- Yes! Yeah!

50:19.680 --> 50:21.523
Yes!

50:21.640 --> 50:23.768
- Whoo!
- Fuck, yes. Fuck, yes.

50:23.840 --> 50:25.888
- So sorry, Craig.
- A lot of guys in here

50:26.000 --> 50:27.321
that I wish it was
instead of you.

50:28.720 --> 50:30.484
You want to go
best two out of three?

50:30.560 --> 50:34.087
If I tug, if I pull in anyway,
or if you hear me screaming,

50:34.160 --> 50:36.561
anything, you pull me
right back in, all right?

50:36.640 --> 50:38.483
Yeah. We'll try, man,
but you're pretty heavy.

50:39.120 --> 50:40.281
What?

50:40.360 --> 50:43.125
No, I mean, I'm saying,
I just don't think it's smart

50:43.200 --> 50:44.645
to make any guarantees.
Fuck, no.

50:44.720 --> 50:46.404
You promise to pull me back in.
No, no, we're...

50:46.520 --> 50:47.641
You got me?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

50:47.680 --> 50:49.045
We're gonna do our best.
All right.

50:49.120 --> 50:50.724
You want to do a test run? Yeah.

50:50.800 --> 50:52.401
You gotta scream.
Let us hear the scream.

50:52.600 --> 50:54.090
Pull.

50:54.160 --> 50:55.605
Nice. Very nice.

50:55.680 --> 50:56.806
Everyone thank Craig
for doing this.

50:56.880 --> 50:58.644
Thanks, Craig.
Thank you, Craig.

50:58.720 --> 50:59.721
Go for it, Craig.

50:59.800 --> 51:01.802
Getting smoky in here.
Go, go, go, go.

51:05.440 --> 51:07.169
This is fucked up.

51:17.840 --> 51:19.683
Goddamn.

51:19.760 --> 51:21.762
Smoky as fuck out here.

51:40.680 --> 51:41.727
Rope burn!
Ah! Ooh!

51:41.800 --> 51:43.484
Grab it, grab it, grab it!

51:43.560 --> 51:44.800
Oh, no, no, no, no!

51:44.880 --> 51:45.927
Shit.
Oh, no.

51:46.040 --> 51:48.042
Shit. Shit.

51:56.720 --> 51:58.006
Come on, motherfucker.
Shit!

52:01.080 --> 52:02.570
Fuck this shit.

52:08.520 --> 52:11.330
Fellas, fellas! Pull me in!
Pull the rope!

52:11.440 --> 52:13.010
Pull me in! We don't
have the rope anymore!

52:13.080 --> 52:14.441
We fucking dropped it!
We're sorry!

52:14.480 --> 52:15.641
You've got the rope, man!

52:15.720 --> 52:17.051
What?

52:22.600 --> 52:24.284
Craig! What the fuck do we do?

52:24.360 --> 52:26.124
Craig! Craig!

52:27.880 --> 52:28.881
Are you okay?

52:28.960 --> 52:30.007
What happened, man?

52:30.080 --> 52:31.720
I don't know! There's
something out there.

52:35.440 --> 52:36.601
Oh, shit!

52:39.760 --> 52:41.808
A knife!
Somebody throw me a knife!

52:41.880 --> 52:43.166
I'll get it.

52:46.840 --> 52:49.081
Why?

52:49.160 --> 52:50.685
Jay, I'm so sorry, bro.

52:50.760 --> 52:51.761
The fuck?

52:53.600 --> 52:55.120
Cut it! Cut it!
Cut it! Cut it! Cut it!

52:56.440 --> 52:58.966
God! What the fuck
was that?

52:59.040 --> 53:00.166
I don't know what
the fuck that was,

53:00.280 --> 53:01.406
but I ain't
going back out there.

53:01.480 --> 53:02.561
Craig, you didn't even
get any of the water.

53:02.640 --> 53:03.641
The door was fucked up.

53:03.720 --> 53:05.882
Damn it,
this is so frustrating!

53:05.960 --> 53:08.247
It's so close, but so far.

53:08.320 --> 53:11.403
The water, it's, like,
right underneath us.

53:11.480 --> 53:13.130
Like, right there.

53:13.200 --> 53:15.965
What do you mean
"right underneath us"?

53:16.040 --> 53:19.328
Like, literally,
like, right there.

53:19.400 --> 53:21.050
If you went right
through the floor.

53:33.240 --> 53:34.685
Yo.

53:34.760 --> 53:39.163
Danny and Jonah's shift ends in ten
minutes, so our break is almost over.

53:39.760 --> 53:41.171
Okay.

53:41.400 --> 53:42.640
Let me ask you something.

53:44.160 --> 53:46.640
You really think this is

53:46.720 --> 53:48.210
the Apocalypse?

53:48.280 --> 53:50.760
You saw something
out there, didn't you?

53:50.840 --> 53:56.290
All right, let's just say for
sake of argument, what if I did?

53:56.360 --> 53:58.488
What if this is the real
shit, right now, happening?

53:59.480 --> 54:01.960
What if it is, man? We're
not prepared for this.

54:02.080 --> 54:04.003
What do we do? What's next?
It says in the Bible,

54:04.080 --> 54:06.003
"The worthy will
ascend to Heaven."

54:06.080 --> 54:11.291
Even if it is the Apocalypse,
it's not the end of us.

54:11.360 --> 54:12.930
There's still hope.

54:13.000 --> 54:16.243
We just have to somehow try
to prove our worthiness.

54:16.320 --> 54:18.607
Okay, so, you mean, like,

54:18.680 --> 54:22.127
like the Ten Commandments,
like, do shit unto people

54:22.200 --> 54:23.440
that'll do
the same shit to you.

54:23.520 --> 54:25.249
That's a great place to start.

54:25.320 --> 54:26.731
You know, to just overall love.

54:26.800 --> 54:29.883
Just be nicer and follow
those commandments.

54:29.960 --> 54:32.281
Listen. We're gonna
get through this.

54:32.360 --> 54:33.681
We're gonna get
through this, man.

54:33.720 --> 54:36.405
You know why? 'Cause we're
gonna do it together.

54:36.480 --> 54:37.686
You promise?

54:37.760 --> 54:39.046
We're gonna do this.

54:40.720 --> 54:42.802
I hear everything.

54:52.920 --> 54:54.843
Who did this?

54:54.920 --> 54:56.285
Who did this?

54:56.360 --> 54:58.601
Did what? What are
you talking about?

54:58.680 --> 55:01.286
Jizzed all over the pages
of this nice magazine

55:01.400 --> 55:03.323
I was nice enough
to tell you about.

55:03.400 --> 55:05.050
Was it you, Seth?

55:05.120 --> 55:06.281
No.

55:06.360 --> 55:07.771
No?
It was me, Franco.

55:07.840 --> 55:09.968
I fucking made jizz
in your magazine.

55:10.040 --> 55:11.849
Why?
When I fucking jack off

55:11.920 --> 55:13.649
long enough,
I end up jizzing, dude.

55:13.720 --> 55:16.291
I'm assuming the same
shit works for you?

55:16.360 --> 55:19.011
Real fucking smart answer! Why
don't you fucking aim, huh?

55:19.080 --> 55:22.289
I have a particularly explosive ejaculate.
It just goes everywhere.

55:22.360 --> 55:24.249
It's like a fucking
wild fireman's hose.

55:24.320 --> 55:25.890
You just got to grab on
and pray to God

55:25.960 --> 55:27.291
it doesn't get in your
eyes or your mouth.

55:27.360 --> 55:29.010
The fuck kind of
jerking off is that?

55:29.080 --> 55:30.081
What, you never had
any brothers?

55:30.160 --> 55:32.766
You didn't learn to jizz in a fucking
sock or on a fucking tissue?

55:32.840 --> 55:34.604
No, I don't have any brothers.

55:34.680 --> 55:36.125
I was raised
in a house of women!

55:36.200 --> 55:37.964
I highly doubt
they fucking taught you

55:38.040 --> 55:40.691
to fucking close your eyes and
fucking cum wherever you want!

55:40.760 --> 55:41.807
I mean, you're getting
all worked up

55:41.880 --> 55:43.450
over a fucking porno mag!

55:43.520 --> 55:45.761
Who has goddamn
porno mags anymore?

55:45.840 --> 55:48.161
Welcome to the 21st
century, Buck Rogers!

55:48.280 --> 55:51.090
You designed a house with
fucking iPads in the walls,

55:51.200 --> 55:53.601
yet you're jerking your dick
like a goddamn pilgrim!

55:53.680 --> 55:56.206
That's right, man.
I like to fucking read!

55:56.280 --> 55:58.360
You think that's the only
thing I jerked off in here?

55:58.400 --> 56:00.360
I've been dropping loads
around this fucking house

56:00.400 --> 56:01.606
like a goddamn dump truck.

56:01.680 --> 56:03.170
You don't cum on my stuff!

56:03.240 --> 56:04.844
I'll cum wherever
the fuck I want, James.

56:04.920 --> 56:06.206
I'll fucking cum
in your kitchen.

56:06.280 --> 56:07.486
I'll cum on your fucking art.

56:07.560 --> 56:09.130
I'll cum anywhere I want!

56:09.200 --> 56:10.884
I will fucking cum
right on you!

56:10.960 --> 56:13.327
I will cum like a fucking
madman all over you, McBride!

56:13.400 --> 56:16.165
Ooh. I fucking wish you'd
cum on me right now.

56:16.240 --> 56:17.605
I fucking dare you
to cum on me!

56:17.680 --> 56:20.081
God!

56:20.160 --> 56:22.367
I'm gonna jack my dick
so fucking hard in here!

56:22.480 --> 56:25.006
This, no more, man.
All over your fucking face.

56:25.080 --> 56:27.128
This fucking all more.
All over the fucking place!

56:27.200 --> 56:28.850
I'll fucking cum
anywhere I want!

56:28.920 --> 56:30.251
I'll fucking cum
on these walls!

56:30.320 --> 56:31.810
I'll cum on
the fucking cabinets!

56:31.880 --> 56:33.450
On the fucking furniture!
I'll cum everywhere!

56:33.520 --> 56:35.284
If I see your dick
one more time,

56:35.360 --> 56:36.725
I'm gonna fucking shoot it off!

56:36.800 --> 56:38.609
You don't have
enough bullets, bitch.

56:38.680 --> 56:41.206
No fucking jerking off
in my house, McBride!

56:44.240 --> 56:45.969
Come on, man.
Fuck this.

56:46.040 --> 56:47.690
I'm just... I'm too
thirsty to do this.

56:47.800 --> 56:49.040
And the fucking bitter irony is

56:49.080 --> 56:51.287
I'm not gonna have my thirst
quenched until I finish this.

56:51.360 --> 56:52.885
God damn it, I hate it.
Danny, no.

56:52.960 --> 56:54.371
Don't walk away. Danny,
don't walk away from me!

56:54.440 --> 56:57.489
It's too late, Seth. I've
already walked away too much.

56:57.600 --> 56:59.329
No, you haven't. You
could still come back

56:59.400 --> 57:01.971
and just fucking turn around
and come back and help me.

57:03.960 --> 57:05.166
Danny?

57:05.880 --> 57:07.086
Daniel?

57:16.360 --> 57:17.691
Need a hand?

57:18.280 --> 57:19.566
Yeah, dude.

57:19.640 --> 57:20.607
Your shift just ended, man.

57:20.680 --> 57:22.091
You don't have to help me
if you don't want to.

57:22.160 --> 57:23.321
It's fine, I get it.

57:23.400 --> 57:25.164
The fuck else am I doing?

57:25.240 --> 57:27.368
I appreciate it, man.
Thank you.

57:27.440 --> 57:28.885
Done and done.
That's cool.

57:35.200 --> 57:37.771
I don't know why I'm thinking
of this, but remember that time

57:37.840 --> 57:41.640
that I got you a fucking
Taco Bell gift certificate

57:41.720 --> 57:43.404
for, like, 20 bucks,
and I bet you

57:43.520 --> 57:45.488
that you couldn't eat
all of that in one sitting.

57:45.560 --> 57:47.324
I do remember that.
I remember thinking,

57:47.440 --> 57:48.680
"How much food
could 20 dollars"

57:48.720 --> 57:50.085
"possibly buy you
at Taco Bell?"

57:50.160 --> 57:51.605
And the answer is infinite.

57:51.680 --> 57:53.682
And we went to see
fucking Gladiator.

57:53.760 --> 57:54.807
Yeah.

57:54.880 --> 57:57.326
And you sharted midway
through the movie.

57:57.400 --> 57:59.050
I did. Due to the
tigers' appearance.

57:59.160 --> 58:00.685
I got scared of the tigers.
Yeah.

58:00.760 --> 58:02.250
Literally, when the second
tiger came out, I went...

58:02.320 --> 58:03.685
...and then I shat.

58:03.760 --> 58:05.091
I shat in the theater.

58:12.080 --> 58:14.082
Jesus.
Oh, fuck.

58:14.160 --> 58:15.571
You guys okay?

58:15.640 --> 58:17.290
I broke my ass in half. Here.

58:17.360 --> 58:18.885
Shit, they got through!

58:18.960 --> 58:21.167
You guys fucking did it.
Oh, my God.

58:21.240 --> 58:22.241
Fuck. Did that hurt?

58:22.320 --> 58:23.606
Oh, yes, it fucking hurt.

58:23.680 --> 58:25.682
I loosened this up for
you, I'll have you know.

58:25.760 --> 58:27.569
Okay, just shut up. It's
fucking dark down here.

58:27.640 --> 58:30.086
Hold on, hold on.

58:30.960 --> 58:32.041
Nice.

58:32.160 --> 58:34.083
Okay, good. Thank you.
What is that?

58:34.160 --> 58:36.845
That's Terrence Peterson. My
monkey flashlight keychain.

58:36.960 --> 58:38.644
Monkey flashlight keychain?
Mmm-hmm.

58:38.720 --> 58:40.290
What's his name?
Terrence Peterson.

58:40.360 --> 58:41.771
You see it, Seth?
No. Where...

58:41.840 --> 58:43.171
Are you sure
it's even down here?

58:43.240 --> 58:44.287
Terry Pete.

58:44.360 --> 58:45.691
Uh, not sure.

58:45.760 --> 58:47.091
Is there, is there
any weird shit down here?

58:47.160 --> 58:50.050
Nah, it's where I keep all
my stuff from my old movies.

58:50.120 --> 58:51.360
Costumes, props.

59:02.720 --> 59:04.290
What?
Is someone down there?

59:04.360 --> 59:07.569
It's your fucking stupid
cutout from Spider-Man 3.

59:07.640 --> 59:09.165
Jesus Christ.

59:09.240 --> 59:10.287
No shit!

59:10.400 --> 59:11.481
- There it is!
- Yes! Yeah!

59:11.560 --> 59:13.483
- What, did you find it?
- Yeah!

59:15.560 --> 59:17.050
<i>♪ La-da-da-da-dah</i>

59:17.120 --> 59:19.122
<i>♪ It's the motherfucking
D-O-double-G</i>

59:19.240 --> 59:20.571
<i>♪ Snoop Dogg!</i>

59:20.640 --> 59:22.051
<i>♪ La-da-da-da-dahh</i>

59:22.160 --> 59:24.367
<i>♪ You know I'm mobbin'

59:24.600 --> 59:25.726
Water.

59:27.320 --> 59:28.890
Mmm!

59:29.000 --> 59:31.082
That is so fucking good.

59:31.160 --> 59:32.605
The two heroes over here,
breaking through the floor.

59:32.680 --> 59:34.205
We did break through the floor.

59:34.280 --> 59:36.203
Any of you guys would
have done the same thing.

59:36.280 --> 59:38.601
Oh, man.
That fucking hurt.

59:38.720 --> 59:40.848
Yeah, I'm surprised
you didn't shart again.

59:40.920 --> 59:42.081
I think I did.

59:42.160 --> 59:44.003
Hey, what year
is this? 19...

59:44.080 --> 59:45.720
That's a good...
That's a good year.

59:45.760 --> 59:47.046
Hey, hey.
Yo, yo, yo!

59:47.120 --> 59:48.804
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
What are you doing?

59:48.880 --> 59:49.961
What am I doing?

59:51.320 --> 59:52.765
Fuck, man.

59:52.840 --> 59:54.763
I'm just pouring myself
another glass of water

59:54.840 --> 59:56.808
to wash down that dry-ass
Cinnamon Toast Crunch.

59:56.880 --> 59:58.120
That's very nice,
but you can't just

59:58.240 --> 59:59.880
pour yourself another
glass of water, man!

59:59.920 --> 01:00:01.001
Will you cut it out?

01:00:01.080 --> 01:00:03.367
Yeah. We agreed to
one glass at dinner,

01:00:03.440 --> 01:00:04.601
we voted on it, man.

01:00:04.680 --> 01:00:05.920
Well, man, I'm just
getting sick and tired

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:07.365
of all these
fucking rules, man.

01:00:07.440 --> 01:00:08.851
You don't see me putting
rules on you guys.

01:00:08.920 --> 01:00:11.287
You cannot have
another glass of water.

01:00:11.360 --> 01:00:13.408
Jay weighs 150 pounds
less than me.

01:00:13.480 --> 01:00:15.369
Why the fuck is it fair

01:00:15.440 --> 01:00:17.329
that him and I should drink
the same amount of water?

01:00:17.400 --> 01:00:19.129
We should be
dividing our rations

01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:21.089
based on our
proportionate size.

01:00:21.160 --> 01:00:23.640
I don't want to come off
as a diva here or anything.

01:00:23.720 --> 01:00:24.960
It's just that I think everyone

01:00:25.040 --> 01:00:26.326
should split
everything equally.

01:00:26.400 --> 01:00:28.607
"I just think that everybody
should have the fucking same."

01:00:28.680 --> 01:00:30.762
"I have a goddamn earring."
Shut the fuck up, Jonah!

01:00:30.840 --> 01:00:32.569
You know what, Danny?
If you weren't jizzing

01:00:32.640 --> 01:00:34.483
all the time, maybe
you'd be more hydrated.

01:00:34.560 --> 01:00:36.164
You're making me into a
joke right now, Franco,

01:00:36.240 --> 01:00:38.049
and you are not gonna like
the fucking punch line.

01:00:38.120 --> 01:00:41.044
No more jerking off! No more water!
Just sit the fuck down!

01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:42.451
Okay, I'm done.

01:00:42.520 --> 01:00:43.726
We're not gonna
have any more water.

01:00:43.800 --> 01:00:44.801
Good.
All right.

01:00:46.800 --> 01:00:48.404
Hey!

01:00:55.640 --> 01:00:57.404
Someone help me!
Fucking grab it!

01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:01.400
What are you doing?

01:01:01.480 --> 01:01:02.520
You guys made this happen!

01:01:02.560 --> 01:01:05.040
You guys forced my fucking
hand by ganging up on me.

01:01:05.120 --> 01:01:08.090
God damn it, I'm gonna fucking
kill this motherfucker!

01:01:10.160 --> 01:01:12.606
That's what I thought.
Nerd.

01:01:17.360 --> 01:01:18.880
All right, guys,

01:01:18.920 --> 01:01:20.046
let's get rid of him.

01:01:20.120 --> 01:01:21.451
What?
What do you mean?

01:01:21.520 --> 01:01:23.045
Like, kick him
out of the house?

01:01:23.120 --> 01:01:25.885
His fucking reckless behavior
is dragging us all down.

01:01:25.960 --> 01:01:27.962
I mean, he wasted
our water twice.

01:01:28.080 --> 01:01:29.923
Two times. Two times.

01:01:30.040 --> 01:01:32.520
Dan is under a lot
of pressure. Okay?

01:01:32.600 --> 01:01:34.364
And he's not handling it as
good as the rest of us are.

01:01:34.440 --> 01:01:37.171
Look at him. He's wearing
my fucking tuxedo.

01:01:37.240 --> 01:01:38.844
He's been eating nonstop.

01:01:38.920 --> 01:01:41.287
The fucker's gained weight
since he got here.

01:01:41.360 --> 01:01:43.362
The fucker's got to go.

01:01:43.440 --> 01:01:44.441
Go.

01:01:44.520 --> 01:01:46.124
The fucker's got to go.

01:01:50.640 --> 01:01:52.210
This is how you all feel?

01:01:52.280 --> 01:01:53.566
We talked about it.

01:01:53.640 --> 01:01:56.530
You guys are gonna
vote me off the island?

01:01:56.600 --> 01:01:59.524
I mean, I made
you guys breakfast.

01:01:59.600 --> 01:02:01.887
Shit, man, you wasted half of
our food when you did that.

01:02:01.960 --> 01:02:04.691
Just thought I was doing
something nice for you guys.

01:02:04.760 --> 01:02:08.048
Just to apologize for my
behavior at the party.

01:02:08.160 --> 01:02:09.491
Party I wasn't even invited to.

01:02:09.800 --> 01:02:11.768
I'm not an idiot.

01:02:12.240 --> 01:02:14.846
I know why you guys don't fucking
call me or hang out with me anymore.

01:02:14.960 --> 01:02:18.009
It's because I party
so fucking hard.

01:02:18.440 --> 01:02:21.489
Always have.
Ever since I was a baby.

01:02:21.560 --> 01:02:23.289
I wouldn't just suck
on my mama's titties.

01:02:23.360 --> 01:02:26.489
I would fucking bang 'em
and motorboat 'em.

01:02:27.680 --> 01:02:31.207
Everything I've been doing
has just been a cry for help.

01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:34.090
When I came on
your magazine, James,

01:02:34.160 --> 01:02:36.128
it was a cum for help.

01:02:36.200 --> 01:02:40.000
I've just been crying and
comin' and crying and comin',

01:02:40.680 --> 01:02:42.921
tears from the tip
of my penis, dudes.

01:02:44.280 --> 01:02:45.964
I'm sorry, all right? You
can cum wherever you want.

01:02:46.040 --> 01:02:48.486
I don't even care about
cumming anymore.

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.446
Right now, I'm just
kind of into going.

01:02:53.600 --> 01:02:55.284
Danny.
Danny.

01:02:55.360 --> 01:02:56.441
Hey.
Come on, man.

01:02:56.520 --> 01:02:58.045
I fucked up.

01:02:58.120 --> 01:02:59.360
I'm sorry, man.
Come on, look,

01:02:59.480 --> 01:03:01.164
I was wrong. SETH: I
feel like shit, man.

01:03:01.240 --> 01:03:02.730
I didn't want it
to happen like this.

01:03:02.840 --> 01:03:03.921
Let's just discuss it
some more, okay?

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:05.286
Yeah. Let's just
talk, dude.

01:03:05.360 --> 01:03:08.045
We're giving you an option.
It's a choice, man.

01:03:08.120 --> 01:03:09.963
There's nothing to
figure out, all right?

01:03:10.040 --> 01:03:12.725
You guys have said enough, and
there's no going back anymore.

01:03:13.880 --> 01:03:16.884
I don't know if there maybe is, like,
something you guys could give me

01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:19.566
so I could at least have some sort
of protection while I'm out there.

01:03:19.640 --> 01:03:21.961
Danny, you don't
have to do this.

01:03:22.040 --> 01:03:23.451
- Yeah, man.
- All right,

01:03:23.520 --> 01:03:24.726
if you're really leaving

01:03:26.040 --> 01:03:28.122
then you should take this.

01:03:28.240 --> 01:03:29.890
Really?

01:03:29.960 --> 01:03:32.281
You don't know
what's out there.

01:03:35.600 --> 01:03:37.284
Thank you, James.

01:03:38.160 --> 01:03:41.562
It means a lot to you, and I
appreciate that you'd give this to me,

01:03:41.640 --> 01:03:43.483
you stupid,
stupid motherfucker!

01:03:46.800 --> 01:03:49.565
Fucking psychopath.
It's a prop gun!

01:03:49.640 --> 01:03:51.210
What, do you think I'd put
real bullets in here?

01:03:51.280 --> 01:03:53.601
You were gonna send me out
there with a fucking gun

01:03:53.680 --> 01:03:54.727
filled with blanks?
Oh, fuck you!

01:03:54.800 --> 01:03:56.040
Don't turn this around on us.

01:03:56.120 --> 01:03:58.122
You just tried to shoot
us, you fucking dickhead!

01:03:58.200 --> 01:03:59.247
Fucking murdering motherfucker!

01:03:59.320 --> 01:04:01.687
Whatever. Fucking
civilization is broken down.

01:04:01.760 --> 01:04:04.161
There's no more reason
for this false bullshit.

01:04:04.240 --> 01:04:06.163
You guys act like you're so
fucking high and mighty,

01:04:06.240 --> 01:04:08.527
like you've never made a
goddamn mistake before.

01:04:08.600 --> 01:04:10.568
Franco, you're just
a pretentious fucking nerd.

01:04:10.640 --> 01:04:11.687
Fuck you.

01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:12.841
And, Jonah,

01:04:12.920 --> 01:04:14.285
you fucking cunt.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:19.049
Craig, you didn't have
my back, back there.

01:04:19.160 --> 01:04:21.288
You fuckin' disappoint me. Bro.

01:04:21.360 --> 01:04:24.125
And, Seth,
you duplicitous taint.

01:04:24.200 --> 01:04:27.124
What? Then of course,
there's Jay,

01:04:27.200 --> 01:04:30.761
the self-righteous, cock-sucking,
two-faced backstabber.

01:04:30.840 --> 01:04:32.569
What the fuck
are you talking about?

01:04:32.680 --> 01:04:34.409
I overheard your little
conversation with Craig, all right?

01:04:34.480 --> 01:04:36.801
The only reason why you
care about any of us is

01:04:36.880 --> 01:04:38.530
because you think that's
what God wants you to do.

01:04:38.600 --> 01:04:39.965
You don't give a shit about us.

01:04:40.040 --> 01:04:42.168
No, no, no, no, that's fucking
twisting that shit...

01:04:42.240 --> 01:04:43.241
You're fucking lying.

01:04:43.320 --> 01:04:44.685
Am I twisting this?

01:04:44.760 --> 01:04:47.604
I believe you were
in Los Angeles

01:04:47.680 --> 01:04:49.523
two months ago,
at the Four Seasons.

01:04:49.600 --> 01:04:53.082
I saw you there, and you specifically
asked me not to tell Seth,

01:04:53.200 --> 01:04:55.726
so that you could
maintain the illusion

01:04:55.800 --> 01:04:57.245
that you always stay with Seth

01:04:57.320 --> 01:04:58.401
when you're in Los Angeles.

01:04:58.480 --> 01:05:00.130
Ooh!

01:05:01.160 --> 01:05:02.366
Jay.

01:05:02.440 --> 01:05:04.169
- Fuck, man.
- It's not...

01:05:04.240 --> 01:05:06.561
Textbook twattage.

01:05:06.640 --> 01:05:08.642
And just for
the record, you guys,

01:05:08.720 --> 01:05:11.007
I'm choosing to leave,
you're not kicking me out.

01:05:11.080 --> 01:05:13.208
You guys had already said
that I could come back in

01:05:13.280 --> 01:05:15.487
and I'm the one who said
that I'm not coming back in.

01:05:15.560 --> 01:05:16.846
Don't be cocky.

01:05:22.280 --> 01:05:23.645
Get the fuck out of here.

01:05:25.320 --> 01:05:26.970
Is that true?

01:05:29.040 --> 01:05:30.087
Yes.

01:05:30.160 --> 01:05:31.525
Jay...

01:05:32.760 --> 01:05:34.250
I know this is
probably my fault

01:05:34.320 --> 01:05:35.731
because I put you
on a pedestal,

01:05:35.800 --> 01:05:38.485
but you should not be
dishonest with your friends.

01:05:38.560 --> 01:05:40.642
But you really let me down.

01:05:41.720 --> 01:05:43.290
Hey! Whoa!
Jay, damn, man.

01:05:43.360 --> 01:05:45.727
- Fucker.
- What the hell?

01:05:45.800 --> 01:05:47.689
It's all fucked, isn't it?

01:05:48.400 --> 01:05:49.765
Jonah, you okay?
Yeah.

01:05:50.240 --> 01:05:51.571
Bleeding?

01:05:55.360 --> 01:05:56.361
Yeah.

01:05:58.920 --> 01:06:02.925
His insides hurt worse
than my outsides.

01:06:10.720 --> 01:06:12.051
Dear God,

01:06:13.760 --> 01:06:16.047
I'd like to pray
to You for a second.

01:06:16.120 --> 01:06:17.804
It's me, Jonah Hill.

01:06:19.800 --> 01:06:21.484
From <i>Moneyball.</i>

01:06:23.800 --> 01:06:28.203
I hate Jay so fucking much.

01:06:28.280 --> 01:06:31.250
I think he might be the worst
person You ever created.

01:06:31.320 --> 01:06:34.847
I don't want to
judge You, but...

01:06:34.920 --> 01:06:38.163
What's up? What were
You thinking that day?

01:06:38.240 --> 01:06:42.802
I love Seth, I love being his
friend, he's an awesome guy,

01:06:42.880 --> 01:06:45.167
but it's like Jay is
the last connection

01:06:45.240 --> 01:06:48.767
to his shitty,
weird Canadian life.

01:06:49.920 --> 01:06:51.684
Just do me one favor, God.

01:06:53.880 --> 01:06:55.644
Just kill Jay.

01:06:58.040 --> 01:06:59.644
That'd be so tight.

01:07:57.880 --> 01:07:59.769
Stop, man.

01:07:59.840 --> 01:08:02.002
Seriously, Craig, stop.

01:08:02.480 --> 01:08:04.403
Your nails are sharp.

01:08:16.520 --> 01:08:17.680
This is no dream!

01:08:18.640 --> 01:08:20.926
This is really happening!

01:08:21.920 --> 01:08:23.046
No!

01:08:35.760 --> 01:08:39.765
<i>Something, um, not that
chill happened last night.</i>

01:08:40.720 --> 01:08:45.044
<i>Yo, so, I just drank my own
pee for the first time.</i>

01:08:45.720 --> 01:08:50.122
<i>And it ain't bad.
I never thought to do it.</i>

01:08:50.200 --> 01:08:53.328
<i>I always thought, you know,
pee stink, whatever, but...</i>

01:08:53.439 --> 01:08:54.805
<i>Shh.</i>

01:09:11.319 --> 01:09:13.243
I think we all
remember how this works.

01:09:13.319 --> 01:09:15.482
Whoever gets the burnt match
has to go to one of Franco's

01:09:15.560 --> 01:09:17.483
neighbors' houses, get us
some food and some water.

01:09:17.560 --> 01:09:19.403
No-ho-ho.
No, I'm not going first.

01:09:19.479 --> 01:09:20.970
- I'll go first.
- Thank you.

01:09:21.040 --> 01:09:22.804
Very mature of you.
Thank you.

01:09:27.240 --> 01:09:28.604
Yes!

01:09:28.680 --> 01:09:30.408
Sorry.

01:09:31.520 --> 01:09:32.520
Good job.

01:09:36.240 --> 01:09:37.446
You okay, Jonah?

01:09:37.520 --> 01:09:38.567
What's that?

01:09:38.640 --> 01:09:39.720
You okay?

01:09:40.399 --> 01:09:43.243
Yeah. Just bad sleep.
Crazy dream.

01:09:43.319 --> 01:09:44.606
Here, Jonah.

01:09:47.840 --> 01:09:49.205
Jonah.

01:09:49.279 --> 01:09:51.362
Okay.
Shit.

01:09:51.439 --> 01:09:52.930
Craigers, you feeling lucky?

01:09:53.240 --> 01:09:54.730
Will history repeat itself?

01:09:57.480 --> 01:09:58.527
Thank you.

01:10:01.560 --> 01:10:02.846
You got this, dawg.

01:10:10.720 --> 01:10:13.087
Seth! No! Not you!

01:10:20.240 --> 01:10:21.241
I'm not going.

01:10:21.360 --> 01:10:23.727
What?
I'm not going.

01:10:23.800 --> 01:10:25.086
I'm bowing out.
I'm declining to go.

01:10:25.160 --> 01:10:26.207
What?

01:10:26.280 --> 01:10:27.440
Let me break it down for you.

01:10:27.680 --> 01:10:29.284
I'm not fucking going.

01:10:29.360 --> 01:10:31.408
You are definitely going.
Tell him he's fucking going.

01:10:31.480 --> 01:10:33.767
Tell you what, why don't you
fucking go, Mr. Self-Righteous?

01:10:33.840 --> 01:10:36.286
You're constantly saying what
assholes we are, how good you are.

01:10:36.360 --> 01:10:37.930
You go get us
some fuckin' water.

01:10:42.040 --> 01:10:43.166
I will go.

01:10:44.320 --> 01:10:45.970
Because I have

01:10:46.040 --> 01:10:47.929
- something called honor.
- Fuck, fuck, fuck.

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:49.809
That's good. Yeah,
you're very honorable.

01:10:50.240 --> 01:10:51.605
I'll go with you, Jay.

01:10:51.680 --> 01:10:52.841
Really?

01:10:52.920 --> 01:10:55.321
Is it because of
our pact upstairs?

01:10:55.400 --> 01:10:57.846
Nah, 'cause you got
them skinny-ass arms.

01:10:57.920 --> 01:10:59.968
You couldn't carry enough
to feed a hamster.

01:11:01.440 --> 01:11:02.487
It's working.

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:07.365
Let's get that money.

01:11:07.440 --> 01:11:09.010
Let's do it.

01:11:09.520 --> 01:11:11.841
Yo. Out and to the left.
Shh-shh.

01:11:19.320 --> 01:11:20.367
Bye.

01:11:25.360 --> 01:11:26.691
Oh, my God.

01:11:26.800 --> 01:11:28.040
What?

01:11:28.560 --> 01:11:30.210
That's so sad.

01:11:31.400 --> 01:11:33.528
Innocence lost.

01:11:39.560 --> 01:11:40.925
What is that?

01:11:41.200 --> 01:11:42.167
Fire.

01:11:42.240 --> 01:11:43.730
There's, like, fire everywhere.

01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:45.086
Damn it!

01:11:46.040 --> 01:11:47.405
Hey, hey!

01:11:49.280 --> 01:11:51.487
Fuck, yeah. Let's
go, let's go, let's go.

01:12:06.640 --> 01:12:08.369
Hello?
Shut the fuck up!

01:12:08.480 --> 01:12:10.130
What? You
yelling that shit for?

01:12:10.200 --> 01:12:11.929
We got to find out...
Don't yell no more, man.

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.002
Crack you in the head
with this frying pan.

01:12:14.080 --> 01:12:18.085
Okay. So we should probably
split up, cover more ground.

01:12:18.160 --> 01:12:20.447
What you think
this is, Scooby-Doo?

01:12:20.560 --> 01:12:22.210
We're gonna go in there, we're
gonna find the kitchen,

01:12:22.280 --> 01:12:24.009
and get as much shit
as we can, together!

01:12:24.080 --> 01:12:25.241
Then we're getting
the fuck out of here.

01:12:25.360 --> 01:12:27.089
All right, all right.
All right?

01:12:30.800 --> 01:12:31.801
Hey.

01:12:32.400 --> 01:12:33.526
Hey.

01:12:33.600 --> 01:12:35.204
What are you doing?

01:12:35.280 --> 01:12:37.487
That should be me out there.

01:12:37.560 --> 01:12:39.289
I totally fucked those guys.

01:12:39.920 --> 01:12:41.285
Mmm.

01:12:42.600 --> 01:12:43.761
Fuck was that?

01:12:45.360 --> 01:12:47.283
Oh, fuck!
Is he okay?

01:12:47.360 --> 01:12:48.521
Dude! Jonah!

01:12:48.600 --> 01:12:50.045
What the fuck?
What do we do?

01:12:50.120 --> 01:12:51.770
- Do you know first aid or anything?
- No.

01:12:51.840 --> 01:12:52.921
Jonah!
I suck at first aid.

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:54.286
Are you okay? Shit!
Jonah?

01:12:54.360 --> 01:12:56.203
Oh, no.
Low blood sugar. LBS.

01:12:56.280 --> 01:12:58.123
LBS! He's having an LBS episode!

01:12:58.200 --> 01:13:00.248
I'll get the Milky Way!
You get the Milky Way!

01:13:03.480 --> 01:13:04.527
Ugh!

01:13:09.160 --> 01:13:10.650
Jay.

01:13:13.320 --> 01:13:15.402
Jonah, stay with me!
Stay with me.

01:13:15.480 --> 01:13:17.403
I got it, I got it, I got
it, got it, open his mouth.

01:13:17.480 --> 01:13:18.766
It's your friend, Seth.
Open his mouth.

01:13:18.840 --> 01:13:21.320
Open his mouth. Open his mouth.
I'll get this in there.

01:13:21.400 --> 01:13:22.731
Okay, okay.
Shove it right in there.

01:13:22.800 --> 01:13:24.325
Jonah.
Milky Way, Jonah.

01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:25.925
You love the Milky Way.
Yummy, yum.

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:27.331
It's not fucking working, man!

01:13:27.400 --> 01:13:28.401
What the fuck!

01:13:28.480 --> 01:13:29.606
How do we get it in there?

01:13:29.680 --> 01:13:32.843
Chew it up, chew it up and spit
in his mouth like a baby bird.

01:13:33.560 --> 01:13:34.561
Mmm!

01:13:34.680 --> 01:13:35.720
You just swallowed it, man.

01:13:35.760 --> 01:13:36.761
It's so good.

01:13:36.840 --> 01:13:38.444
Give me a bite.

01:13:38.520 --> 01:13:39.601
Mmm!

01:13:39.680 --> 01:13:42.365
The second it hits your
mouth is, like, amazing.

01:13:43.840 --> 01:13:46.002
- Okay.
- Open it.

01:13:53.400 --> 01:13:55.004
What the fuck was that?

01:13:55.080 --> 01:13:57.128
That's Hebrew.
That's not Hebrew.

01:13:57.200 --> 01:13:58.565
It's fuckin' Latin
or something like that.

01:13:58.640 --> 01:14:00.881
I went to Hebrew school for six years.
That's not Hebrew.

01:14:01.720 --> 01:14:03.961
You will
drown in a river of blood.

01:14:04.040 --> 01:14:05.963
The End of Days is here.

01:14:06.040 --> 01:14:08.964
You will quiver in the
shadow of Kingdom Come.

01:14:09.040 --> 01:14:11.964
Judgment Day is upon you.

01:14:12.040 --> 01:14:16.329
The Apocalypse is nigh!

01:14:18.880 --> 01:14:20.848
Hey, I think
that's all it could fit.

01:14:21.560 --> 01:14:25.610
Man, let's take this back to
Franco's, get the fuck out of here.

01:14:25.680 --> 01:14:26.886
Uh, uh...

01:14:27.600 --> 01:14:28.806
What are we going back for?

01:14:28.880 --> 01:14:29.961
What are you talking about?

01:14:30.040 --> 01:14:34.011
In theory, we could
just fuckin' stay here.

01:14:34.080 --> 01:14:37.004
And here,
you don't have to sleep

01:14:37.080 --> 01:14:39.970
in a friggin'
tent under a dick.

01:14:40.040 --> 01:14:41.405
I like my dick tent.

01:14:41.480 --> 01:14:42.527
I'm just saying,

01:14:42.600 --> 01:14:46.400
we could build a life here together, Craig.
I'd be really good to you.

01:14:46.840 --> 01:14:48.763
All I know is
I'm scared as hell,

01:14:48.880 --> 01:14:51.645
and I just want to
get back to our friends.

01:14:51.720 --> 01:14:53.000
Yeah, but they're
not my friends.

01:14:53.400 --> 01:14:54.367
Seth is your friend.

01:14:54.440 --> 01:14:56.647
We've been growing
apart for years.

01:14:56.760 --> 01:14:59.331
That's why I didn't stay with
him last time I was here.

01:14:59.400 --> 01:15:01.846
And I stayed with him this
time to try and salvage it,

01:15:01.920 --> 01:15:03.684
but clearly
that didn't work out.

01:15:03.760 --> 01:15:06.411
Jay, like it or not,

01:15:07.040 --> 01:15:08.769
those assholes are all we got.

01:15:12.800 --> 01:15:13.801
Did you hear that?

01:15:13.880 --> 01:15:15.405
Yeah, that was a creak.

01:15:20.520 --> 01:15:22.522
What is that?

01:15:23.880 --> 01:15:25.928
What is that? Is that bile? Ew!

01:15:26.040 --> 01:15:28.088
I don't know.
It's cold.

01:15:28.160 --> 01:15:29.400
Sniff it.

01:15:29.480 --> 01:15:31.960
No. You sniff it.

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:34.047
Ew!

01:15:34.120 --> 01:15:35.804
What?
It smells like puke.

01:15:35.880 --> 01:15:36.881
Ew! Ew!

01:15:36.960 --> 01:15:38.610
Don't get it on me! Ew!

01:15:49.280 --> 01:15:50.611
It's in my eyes!
Dude!

01:15:50.680 --> 01:15:53.001
It's in my mouth!
He's gone!

01:15:53.080 --> 01:15:55.242
Where is he?
He's fucking gone!

01:15:55.360 --> 01:15:57.567
Shit! Shit!
Shit! Shit!

01:16:07.040 --> 01:16:09.646
Please, God!
Jesus, Jesus!

01:16:17.280 --> 01:16:18.281
Fuck.

01:16:19.040 --> 01:16:20.769
Jonah!
Jonah!

01:16:20.840 --> 01:16:22.922
Jonah, stop this!

01:16:23.040 --> 01:16:24.610
Please! Jonah, where
the fuck are you?

01:16:24.680 --> 01:16:26.330
Why did you vomit on us!

01:16:29.760 --> 01:16:31.683
Bad Jonah! Stop!

01:16:31.760 --> 01:16:33.603
Stop eating him!

01:16:33.680 --> 01:16:35.682
Watch out!
He's super strong!

01:16:35.800 --> 01:16:36.801
Aah!

01:16:38.200 --> 01:16:39.281
Shit!

01:16:39.360 --> 01:16:41.522
What is happen...

01:16:41.600 --> 01:16:42.761
Oh, no!

01:16:42.840 --> 01:16:44.604
I'm gonna
tittie-fuck you, Seth.

01:16:44.680 --> 01:16:46.125
Don't tittie-fuck me!

01:16:46.200 --> 01:16:47.645
What are they,
big B's or small C's?

01:16:47.720 --> 01:16:50.291
I'm gonna push
your titties together.

01:16:50.360 --> 01:16:52.010
Push 'em together!

01:16:52.080 --> 01:16:53.650
I'll get you something to help!

01:16:53.720 --> 01:16:54.721
I'll pass you something!

01:16:54.800 --> 01:16:55.881
Okay, pass it to me.

01:16:56.520 --> 01:16:58.488
OW! Fuck! Shit!

01:17:01.520 --> 01:17:02.521
Aah! Oh!

01:17:04.520 --> 01:17:05.646
Seth!

01:17:07.200 --> 01:17:09.202
We're getting crazy!

01:17:15.120 --> 01:17:16.406
Come on! Come on!

01:17:17.800 --> 01:17:20.326
Jesus, open, God damn you, open!

01:17:23.640 --> 01:17:25.483
No, no, no, no.

01:17:31.280 --> 01:17:32.725
Jesus...

01:17:33.240 --> 01:17:35.607
Oh, fuck.

01:17:36.080 --> 01:17:37.764
We gotta hide. We gotta hide.
I know!

01:17:37.920 --> 01:17:39.251
He's coming! He's coming!
I know he's coming!

01:17:39.280 --> 01:17:40.850
I don't know what the fuck to do!

01:17:40.920 --> 01:17:42.649
I don't know...

01:17:42.960 --> 01:17:44.405
Where are you going?

01:17:44.800 --> 01:17:46.404
Shit.

01:17:54.960 --> 01:17:56.928
Please go away.
He's sniffing.

01:17:57.680 --> 01:17:58.720
I'm so scared, James.

01:17:58.760 --> 01:17:59.886
Be quiet.

01:18:01.440 --> 01:18:03.169
You're breathing really loud.
Am I?

01:18:03.560 --> 01:18:05.080
Don't breathe through your mouth.
Okay.

01:18:07.080 --> 01:18:09.924
Now you're doing loud
nose breathing. Am I?

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:11.809
I don't know where else
to breathe from.

01:18:13.440 --> 01:18:14.566
Is that...
Seth.

01:18:19.600 --> 01:18:21.204
Oh, shit.
Don't move.

01:18:21.280 --> 01:18:22.930
Oh, shit, he's coming right this way.
Oh, shit.

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:24.286
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

01:18:31.880 --> 01:18:33.803
Get out of my way!
Move! Move!

01:18:33.880 --> 01:18:35.848
Fuck!

01:18:38.960 --> 01:18:39.961
You Okay?

01:18:40.040 --> 01:18:41.201
Come on!

01:18:41.320 --> 01:18:45.325
Let's go. Let's go.
Okay. Okay. Okay.

01:18:47.840 --> 01:18:49.649
What the fuck! What are you doing?

01:18:49.720 --> 01:18:51.165
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

01:18:51.240 --> 01:18:52.730
There's a fuckin'
demon chasing us!

01:18:52.800 --> 01:18:54.404
A demon?
Demon?

01:18:54.480 --> 01:18:57.324
What the fuck happened to you guys?
That!

01:18:57.400 --> 01:18:58.811
It's Jonah!
He's possessed!

01:18:58.920 --> 01:19:00.160
He's crazy!

01:19:01.120 --> 01:19:03.487
Oh, fuck!
You brained him.

01:19:03.560 --> 01:19:05.289
Is that... I was supposed
to do that, right?

01:19:05.360 --> 01:19:06.441
Yeah.

01:19:09.840 --> 01:19:11.683
Motherfucker.

01:19:12.360 --> 01:19:13.930
- Fasten!
- Hurry!

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:15.365
Fasten, God damn you, bastard!

01:19:15.440 --> 01:19:16.521
He's gonna be fuckin'

01:19:16.560 --> 01:19:17.925
bad news when he wakes up!

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:19.843
He's fuckin' strong.

01:19:19.920 --> 01:19:21.604
My side's good.
Oh, shit!

01:19:21.680 --> 01:19:23.250
All right,
I'll fuckin' hit him.

01:19:23.360 --> 01:19:24.930
Fuck! Come on, come on! Okay!

01:19:30.360 --> 01:19:32.806
This shit's cray cray, guys.

01:19:33.120 --> 01:19:36.090
I mean, it's, like,
the real, like Apocalypse.

01:19:36.160 --> 01:19:38.481
It's, like,
the Book of Revelations,

01:19:38.560 --> 01:19:40.722
like that means there's a God.

01:19:40.800 --> 01:19:42.131
Right?

01:19:42.200 --> 01:19:44.885
I haven't led my life as though
there's a God this whole time.

01:19:44.960 --> 01:19:47.440
Who fuckin' saw that coming?
That there's actually a God?

01:19:47.520 --> 01:19:50.842
I'd say 95% of the planet.

01:19:52.360 --> 01:19:54.488
Jesus fucking Christ, man.

01:19:54.600 --> 01:19:56.648
You might want to stay
away from saying that.

01:19:56.720 --> 01:19:59.166
"Jesus fucking Christ"?
Why?

01:19:59.280 --> 01:20:00.964
Why can't I say that? One
of the Ten Commandments.

01:20:01.040 --> 01:20:03.884
"Thou shall not take the name
of the Lord thy God in vain."

01:20:03.960 --> 01:20:05.405
Jesus isn't the name
of the Lord.

01:20:05.480 --> 01:20:06.686
God is name of the Lord.

01:20:06.760 --> 01:20:08.808
Jesus, God, it's all the same.

01:20:08.880 --> 01:20:11.201
It's the Trinity.
Father, Son, Holy Ghost.

01:20:11.280 --> 01:20:13.169
It's like Neapolitan ice cream.

01:20:13.240 --> 01:20:14.844
I don't even know what
the fucking Commandments are.

01:20:14.920 --> 01:20:19.084
Guys, I think this is sort of bullshit,
because we're all good people.

01:20:19.400 --> 01:20:22.324
I can look at each one of you
in the eye, I know you're good.

01:20:22.400 --> 01:20:24.050
I'm good.
We're four actors.

01:20:24.120 --> 01:20:26.088
We bring joy to people's lives.

01:20:26.160 --> 01:20:27.889
Yeah, but we don't
do it for free.

01:20:27.960 --> 01:20:32.170
We get paid handsomely, much higher
than the average profession.

01:20:32.240 --> 01:20:34.041
It's not like it was just
handed to any of us.

01:20:34.080 --> 01:20:35.730
We've worked really
hard to be here.

01:20:35.800 --> 01:20:37.928
Yeah, pretend like
it's hot when it's cold.

01:20:38.440 --> 01:20:40.602
You sitting on the beach,
it's freezing,

01:20:40.680 --> 01:20:44.765
you in your drawers, talking about
something, everybody's surfing.

01:20:44.840 --> 01:20:47.047
I think God
might have just fucked up,

01:20:47.120 --> 01:20:50.169
made a mistake, and left
us behind by accident.

01:20:50.280 --> 01:20:52.248
I mean, He's got a lot
of shit on His plate.

01:20:52.320 --> 01:20:55.403
It's not an oversight,
it's not a mistake, okay?

01:20:55.480 --> 01:20:59.644
We got to face facts. We're here, and
there's a reason we're all here.

01:20:59.720 --> 01:21:02.041
Why are you so sure?

01:21:02.120 --> 01:21:04.202
I've done things, man. I...

01:21:07.320 --> 01:21:09.084
I gouged a man's eyeballs out.

01:21:09.160 --> 01:21:10.924
What the...
Fuck off.

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:12.764
Craig.
Well, I was a kid, man.

01:21:12.840 --> 01:21:15.047
It was a fuckin' bar fight.

01:21:15.120 --> 01:21:16.451
It was a bad foosball game.

01:21:16.520 --> 01:21:19.205
He said I didn't call spinneys,
and I fuckin' called spinneys.

01:21:19.280 --> 01:21:22.124
He got all in my face, and I smashed
a bottle across his face...

01:21:23.040 --> 01:21:24.724
...and the
first eyeball was an accident,

01:21:24.800 --> 01:21:27.451
but then I was, like, fuck it,
and I went for the second one.

01:21:27.520 --> 01:21:29.568
It was fucked up.
But you know what?

01:21:29.640 --> 01:21:34.089
That shit happens. I'm saying, that's...
I think that's why I'm here.

01:21:34.200 --> 01:21:36.248
I got to admit something.

01:21:36.320 --> 01:21:37.606
I, uh...

01:21:39.480 --> 01:21:40.891
I fucked Lindsay Lohan.

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.844
She was fucked up.
She was high.

01:21:43.960 --> 01:21:45.200
It was at the Chateau Marmont,

01:21:45.280 --> 01:21:46.520
and she kept banging
on my door.

01:21:48.080 --> 01:21:49.809
She kept calling
me Jake Gyllenhaal.

01:21:49.880 --> 01:21:51.166
That's fucked up.

01:21:51.240 --> 01:21:54.767
Yeah, I said, "Call me
the Prince of Persia."

01:21:54.840 --> 01:21:56.046
See, that's what
I'm saying, man.

01:21:56.120 --> 01:21:58.088
We've all done bad shit,
you know?

01:21:58.160 --> 01:22:01.767
We've done more bad shit than
good in our lives, and

01:22:03.160 --> 01:22:06.004
it's time to pay the piper.

01:22:06.960 --> 01:22:08.121
Whoa, shit!

01:22:08.200 --> 01:22:10.202
Something's wrong.

01:22:11.160 --> 01:22:12.491
God did this.

01:22:12.520 --> 01:22:16.161
He gave us light, and then He took it away.

01:22:16.240 --> 01:22:17.605
You hear that?

01:22:17.680 --> 01:22:19.762
It's the soundtrack
of us going insane.

01:22:19.840 --> 01:22:22.684
Damn, I wish there was something
we could do to help him.

01:22:23.720 --> 01:22:25.370
I know what we can do.

01:22:34.200 --> 01:22:36.089
The fuckin' stench.

01:22:49.880 --> 01:22:50.881
Jonah Hill?

01:22:52.600 --> 01:22:53.931
Jonah?

01:22:57.120 --> 01:22:58.531
Jonah Hill.

01:22:58.600 --> 01:23:00.728
Jonah Hill is no more.

01:23:01.960 --> 01:23:03.086
Demon?

01:23:03.160 --> 01:23:05.003
Yes?

01:23:05.080 --> 01:23:07.003
Fuck. That's not good.

01:23:07.080 --> 01:23:08.366
That's not good.

01:23:09.080 --> 01:23:10.650
Jay, you fool.

01:23:10.720 --> 01:23:13.200
I say unto thee,

01:23:13.720 --> 01:23:16.166
the power of Christ
compels you!

01:23:16.240 --> 01:23:19.084
Oh, does it?
Does it compel me?

01:23:19.160 --> 01:23:21.208
The power of Christ
compels you!

01:23:21.280 --> 01:23:22.281
Does it, Jay?

01:23:22.360 --> 01:23:24.283
The power of Christ
compels you!

01:23:24.360 --> 01:23:26.362
Is the power of Christ compelling me?
Is that what's happening?

01:23:26.520 --> 01:23:29.000
The power of Christ compels you!

01:23:29.080 --> 01:23:31.526
Guess what?
It's not that compelling.

01:23:31.600 --> 01:23:33.762
Jay, you serious right now?

01:23:33.840 --> 01:23:36.127
That's your fuckin' plan? You're gonna
repeat lines from <i>The Exorcist?</i>

01:23:36.240 --> 01:23:38.402
I would assume they did
their fuckin' research.

01:23:38.480 --> 01:23:40.323
It's a movie!
It's a manual.

01:23:40.440 --> 01:23:42.480
It's a fuckin' training manual.

01:23:44.240 --> 01:23:45.685
I say unto thee,

01:23:45.960 --> 01:23:48.440
the power of Christ
compels you!

01:23:48.520 --> 01:23:50.727
The power of Christ
compels you!

01:23:51.560 --> 01:23:53.722
The power of Christ
compels you!

01:23:53.840 --> 01:23:55.365
Geez, it hurts a little bit.

01:23:55.440 --> 01:23:56.680
It's, like, this little sting.

01:23:56.800 --> 01:23:59.201
The power of Christ
compels you!

01:23:59.280 --> 01:24:00.361
Seriously, fuck off.

01:24:00.440 --> 01:24:02.966
The power of Christ
compels you!

01:24:05.240 --> 01:24:06.651
Jay?

01:24:06.840 --> 01:24:08.524
The power of Christ
compels you!

01:24:08.600 --> 01:24:09.647
Holy shit!

01:24:09.680 --> 01:24:11.250
You're pissing him off, man.
Just stop it!

01:24:11.320 --> 01:24:13.129
Jay! The power of
Christ compels you!

01:24:15.640 --> 01:24:17.449
The power of...
Get the fuck down!

01:24:17.560 --> 01:24:19.608
Don't fucking push me, asshole!
Geez, man!

01:24:19.680 --> 01:24:20.681
Fuck you! Easy!

01:24:20.760 --> 01:24:21.841
You're a fucking
asshole, you liar!

01:24:21.920 --> 01:24:22.921
Still?

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:24.001
Yes. Still? Yes.

01:24:24.120 --> 01:24:25.565
Guys, guys, we got
a possessed guy here!

01:24:25.640 --> 01:24:27.244
Do we have to argue
about this right now?

01:24:27.320 --> 01:24:28.287
Let 'em fight.

01:24:28.360 --> 01:24:29.885
We got an exorcism
to finish. Hello?

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:31.240
Do you want to know why
I didn't stay with you?

01:24:31.320 --> 01:24:32.890
Yeah.
You fuckin' changed.

01:24:32.960 --> 01:24:35.850
You're a fuckin'
sell-out.

01:24:35.920 --> 01:24:38.161
You did fuckin' sell out.
Everyone says.

01:24:38.240 --> 01:24:42.086
At least I did change! You act like
you're fucking 18 years old still, Jay!

01:24:42.160 --> 01:24:44.481
Grow up, Jay. That's why
he's yelling at you.

01:24:44.600 --> 01:24:46.648
You've been holding me
back this whole time!

01:24:46.720 --> 01:24:48.290
That means fuck you.

01:24:48.360 --> 01:24:50.408
Come on, guys! Come on!

01:24:51.760 --> 01:24:53.762
Fuck you, you piece of shit!

01:24:57.120 --> 01:24:58.326
Everybody, out!

01:24:58.400 --> 01:24:59.640
Craig, stop 'em!

01:24:59.720 --> 01:25:01.529
- Get apart!
- Oh, now it's on.

01:25:01.600 --> 01:25:04.001
Yo! What the fuck
is all this, Franco?

01:25:05.320 --> 01:25:06.960
Uh, looks like food.
How'd that get there?

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:09.401
What?
You have more food?

01:25:09.480 --> 01:25:10.686
You knew he had extra food?

01:25:10.760 --> 01:25:12.489
Yeah, he gave me one cracker.

01:25:12.560 --> 01:25:14.130
I would have sucked a
dick for half a cracker.

01:25:14.200 --> 01:25:16.441
All right, well, maybe I didn't want
you to suck my dick, all right?

01:25:16.560 --> 01:25:17.686
- Look...
- I didn't want to suck it!

01:25:17.840 --> 01:25:19.444
That's the point of what I said!
It was my fucking food!

01:25:19.520 --> 01:25:20.521
Guys, guys, guys, fire!

01:25:20.600 --> 01:25:21.647
Boys, boys, boys...

01:25:21.760 --> 01:25:23.762
Shit!
Jonah's on fire!

01:25:29.560 --> 01:25:30.891
Put it out!

01:25:30.960 --> 01:25:32.371
Use your mouth!
Put it out!

01:25:41.280 --> 01:25:42.725
Go, go, go, go, go!

01:25:51.720 --> 01:25:53.210
Where is he? Where is he?
Where is he?

01:25:53.280 --> 01:25:54.441
Go, go, go!

01:25:57.040 --> 01:25:58.644
Go, go, go, go, go!

01:25:58.720 --> 01:26:00.484
Go, get outside!

01:26:00.560 --> 01:26:02.483
Shit, shit, shit,
shit, shit, shit!

01:26:02.560 --> 01:26:03.561
Go, go on!

01:26:03.640 --> 01:26:05.722
Come on, hurry up, he's coming!

01:26:05.800 --> 01:26:07.484
He's coming!

01:26:20.640 --> 01:26:22.290
Watch out, watch out!

01:26:22.640 --> 01:26:24.961
Oh, my fortress!

01:26:25.880 --> 01:26:28.724
Uh, boys, I just want
to point out, um,

01:26:28.800 --> 01:26:30.290
we're out in the open now.

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:32.126
Oh, fuck.
Shit, shit, shit.

01:26:32.200 --> 01:26:34.362
Oh, shit.
Hey, hey, hey.

01:26:34.440 --> 01:26:35.566
My Prius.
Yeah!

01:26:35.640 --> 01:26:37.449
Yeah!
Yes!

01:26:40.600 --> 01:26:41.681
What is that?

01:26:42.440 --> 01:26:44.442
No fucking way.

01:26:44.560 --> 01:26:46.528
We're screwed!

01:26:46.600 --> 01:26:49.080
We're totally screwed, guys.

01:26:51.920 --> 01:26:52.921
I got this.

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:54.570
What?
I'll distract the thing.

01:26:54.640 --> 01:26:56.608
I'll run over there
screaming and shit,

01:26:56.680 --> 01:27:00.287
and that should give you enough
time to get to the garage.

01:27:00.400 --> 01:27:02.004
Well, yeah, but that
thing can kill you.

01:27:02.080 --> 01:27:05.482
Maybe I deserve it. I've
been shitty my whole life.

01:27:05.560 --> 01:27:07.801
Being selfish,
only doing shit for me.

01:27:07.880 --> 01:27:10.201
Maybe it's only right
that the last thing I do

01:27:10.280 --> 01:27:13.363
on this planet isn't for me.

01:27:13.600 --> 01:27:14.840
It's for you guys.

01:27:14.920 --> 01:27:16.649
Craig, you don't
have to do that.

01:27:16.720 --> 01:27:18.051
Thank you very much, Craig.

01:27:18.120 --> 01:27:19.884
I appreciate that.
You spineless...

01:27:20.600 --> 01:27:22.523
I love you guys.

01:27:22.720 --> 01:27:24.370
You're my best friends.

01:27:24.440 --> 01:27:26.442
You're a real mensch, Craig.

01:27:26.520 --> 01:27:28.727
See you on the other side.

01:27:33.200 --> 01:27:36.329
Hey, hey, asshole!
Hey, come on!

01:27:36.400 --> 01:27:38.482
Pickle dick, demonic-looking
motherfucker.

01:27:38.560 --> 01:27:40.688
Nobody's scared of you.
You ain't a raccoon!

01:27:40.760 --> 01:27:42.569
Yeah, bring your ass, bitch!

01:27:42.640 --> 01:27:45.530
Nobody's scared of you!
I'm Craig fucking Robinson!

01:27:45.720 --> 01:27:46.846
Yeah.

01:27:46.920 --> 01:27:48.081
What's he gonna do?
Craig.

01:27:48.200 --> 01:27:51.249
I hope you like big dick,
motherfucker,

01:27:51.320 --> 01:27:53.163
'cause I'm about
to fuck you raw!

01:27:53.240 --> 01:27:55.527
For the last goddamn time!

01:27:56.040 --> 01:27:57.644
Take your panties off!

01:28:08.480 --> 01:28:10.130
Fuck, yeah!

01:28:12.480 --> 01:28:13.447
It worked.

01:28:13.520 --> 01:28:15.045
What's happening?

01:28:15.120 --> 01:28:17.122
Craig! Craig!

01:28:30.080 --> 01:28:33.209
Holy shit, do you guys
realize what this means?

01:28:33.280 --> 01:28:34.841
That Craig was an angel
this whole time?

01:28:34.880 --> 01:28:37.770
No, no, it means we can
still be saved. No, no.

01:28:39.720 --> 01:28:42.610
I don't fucking get it, why
does Craig get saved? I mean...

01:28:42.680 --> 01:28:45.047
Craig sacrificed
himself for us,

01:28:45.120 --> 01:28:46.929
which means that
there's still hope.

01:28:47.040 --> 01:28:48.849
- That means we can be redeemed.
- Yeah.

01:28:48.920 --> 01:28:50.649
It means that if we're
actually nice to each other,

01:28:50.760 --> 01:28:53.525
we can get sucked up into Heaven, too.
That's the deal.

01:28:53.640 --> 01:28:55.324
All right, I got it,
let's just head out

01:28:55.400 --> 01:28:57.687
to my place in Malibu.
Yeah.

01:28:57.760 --> 01:29:00.923
Just survive long enough until
we do enough good things

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:03.048
and they accumulate
or do enough sacrifices,

01:29:03.120 --> 01:29:04.246
and we'll all go
to Heaven together.

01:29:04.320 --> 01:29:06.288
That's a great idea, James.

01:29:06.400 --> 01:29:08.050
Seriously, really,
really good idea.

01:29:08.120 --> 01:29:09.963
Really, you're
such a smart guy.

01:29:10.040 --> 01:29:12.088
Thanks, Seth,
you're such a nice guy.

01:29:12.400 --> 01:29:13.401
You got a great smile.

01:29:13.480 --> 01:29:15.164
Thanks, man.
And an awesome laugh.

01:29:15.280 --> 01:29:17.248
I've heard it's annoying. How
about that Jay back there, man?

01:29:17.360 --> 01:29:18.930
Dude, Jay, you kidding me?
Come on. Oh, come on.

01:29:19.040 --> 01:29:20.326
One of a kind.
Get out of here.

01:29:20.400 --> 01:29:21.606
You got a cool body.

01:29:21.680 --> 01:29:23.170
You can walk around with
your shirt off anytime.

01:29:23.240 --> 01:29:24.890
It's not working,
this isn't working.

01:29:24.960 --> 01:29:26.801
What, you thought we would
be Raptured already?

01:29:26.880 --> 01:29:27.927
I thought it would
happen already.

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:29.126
No, we've just
been talking nice.

01:29:29.200 --> 01:29:31.089
Talking nice doesn't
get you into Heaven.

01:29:31.160 --> 01:29:33.288
Doesn't hurt to smile...

01:29:35.920 --> 01:29:36.921
What the fuck?

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:38.331
You guys okay?

01:29:38.400 --> 01:29:40.129
Oh, shit.
Christ.

01:29:50.360 --> 01:29:51.805
- Franco!
- Come on!

01:29:54.720 --> 01:29:56.370
Yo, cut his fucking head off!

01:29:56.440 --> 01:29:57.566
What's going on?

01:29:58.920 --> 01:30:00.888
No!

01:30:00.960 --> 01:30:02.200
- No!
- Stop!

01:30:19.720 --> 01:30:20.881
Danny?

01:30:20.960 --> 01:30:22.166
What the fuck?

01:30:22.240 --> 01:30:23.366
You guys are still alive?

01:30:23.480 --> 01:30:24.561
Yeah.

01:30:24.640 --> 01:30:26.722
Holy shit,
I didn't expect that.

01:30:26.800 --> 01:30:28.723
Fuck out here.

01:30:29.640 --> 01:30:30.687
Get...

01:30:30.800 --> 01:30:32.564
Shit, I can't believe
you guys are here. Oh, Jesus.

01:30:32.640 --> 01:30:36.406
That's fucking crazy, and your
timing couldn't be more perfect.

01:30:36.760 --> 01:30:39.366
It's been a long time
since any of us have eaten,

01:30:39.440 --> 01:30:42.250
and you three gentlemen
look delicious.

01:30:42.320 --> 01:30:43.446
What does that
have to do with us?

01:30:43.520 --> 01:30:45.363
The fuck are you talking about?

01:30:45.440 --> 01:30:47.124
I'm a cannibal, hombre.

01:30:47.200 --> 01:30:49.009
We're gonna
fucking eat your ass.

01:30:49.080 --> 01:30:50.650
Fuck you, you can't eat us.
Fuck that, man.

01:30:50.720 --> 01:30:53.564
I do whatever the fuck
I want, when I want.

01:30:53.640 --> 01:30:55.244
I butt-fucked this dude.

01:30:56.400 --> 01:30:57.401
See that?

01:30:57.480 --> 01:30:59.084
I fucking slide
right in that shit.

01:30:59.160 --> 01:31:01.925
I do whatever I want.
This is my gimp.

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:03.570
Channing, introduce yourself.

01:31:03.840 --> 01:31:04.921
Hey, what's up, guys?

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:06.411
Y'all cool?

01:31:06.520 --> 01:31:07.931
That's Channing Tatum.

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:09.764
That's Channing Tatum,
dude. What the fuck?

01:31:09.840 --> 01:31:11.968
Channing fucking Tatum. I found
him wandering on the freeway.

01:31:12.040 --> 01:31:14.725
I collected him, made him my bitch.
Get off my dick.

01:31:14.800 --> 01:31:17.644
I call him
Channing Tate-yum.

01:31:17.720 --> 01:31:18.801
Hard-core, man.

01:31:18.880 --> 01:31:19.961
I got him trained good.

01:31:20.040 --> 01:31:21.690
Watch, he does tricks.
Wait, shake hands.

01:31:21.760 --> 01:31:22.966
All right, Seth.

01:31:23.080 --> 01:31:24.286
Fucking roll over.

01:31:24.360 --> 01:31:25.850
I'm gonna create a diversion.
Yeah.

01:31:25.920 --> 01:31:27.809
- You and Jay make a run for it.
- What?

01:31:27.880 --> 01:31:29.450
Danny's gonna eat you.

01:31:29.520 --> 01:31:32.490
Listen, full-on sacrifice
for you, dawg,

01:31:32.600 --> 01:31:34.640
- like the ending to <i>Pineapple 2.</i>
- Yeah, lick that.

01:31:34.680 --> 01:31:36.284
That's Channing
fucking Tatum, dawg.

01:31:36.760 --> 01:31:37.886
I love him.

01:31:37.960 --> 01:31:40.930
That's fucking G.I. Joe, dude.
Fucking loves me.

01:31:41.240 --> 01:31:43.766
Danny! We're friends!
You can't eat us!

01:31:43.840 --> 01:31:48.368
I'd love to catch up, but we're
fucking starving, so let's eat!

01:31:48.480 --> 01:31:49.527
Fuck you!

01:31:51.280 --> 01:31:52.725
Run!

01:31:54.960 --> 01:31:56.007
Eat this!

01:31:56.840 --> 01:31:59.525
Ow! Shit, fuck!
Get him!

01:32:00.760 --> 01:32:02.000
Who wants it,
you piece of shit?

01:32:02.120 --> 01:32:03.406
Man, we should go back.

01:32:03.440 --> 01:32:05.400
We should go back and help him.
We should go back.

01:32:08.640 --> 01:32:09.687
Fucking Rapture.

01:32:09.760 --> 01:32:11.762
Holy shit!
It worked!

01:32:16.320 --> 01:32:17.765
What the fuck?

01:32:17.840 --> 01:32:20.161
Go to hell, McBride!

01:32:20.240 --> 01:32:21.844
Fuck you!

01:32:23.840 --> 01:32:25.763
Suck my dick!

01:32:26.400 --> 01:32:27.447
Ah...

01:32:28.280 --> 01:32:29.406
Oh!

01:32:30.200 --> 01:32:31.850
- Oh, shit.
- What happened?

01:32:31.920 --> 01:32:34.082
What did I do?
Take me back!

01:32:34.160 --> 01:32:35.161
What did I do?

01:32:35.240 --> 01:32:36.241
I'll tell you
what happened, Franco.

01:32:36.360 --> 01:32:38.362
You don't get to get
sucked up into Heaven

01:32:38.440 --> 01:32:41.808
'cause you were being petty.
Tom Petty.

01:32:41.880 --> 01:32:43.803
You may not have
invited me to your party,

01:32:44.600 --> 01:32:46.204
but you're the guest
of honor at mine.

01:32:46.280 --> 01:32:47.327
What?

01:32:50.840 --> 01:32:52.171
How fucking crazy is this?

01:32:56.280 --> 01:32:58.009
Seth, Jay!

01:32:58.080 --> 01:32:59.684
Oh, shit, they're
running after us.

01:32:59.800 --> 01:33:02.485
Oh, shit! Oh, shit!
Oh, shit! Run.

01:33:02.560 --> 01:33:04.050
Bring them to me!

01:33:04.120 --> 01:33:06.487
- Fuck.
- Get 'em!

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:08.843
Got to get Rogen.

01:33:10.160 --> 01:33:11.127
Over here.

01:33:11.240 --> 01:33:13.004
What? Over here, over here.
Here. What?

01:33:13.080 --> 01:33:15.845
Shit, shit.

01:33:16.520 --> 01:33:18.409
They're around here somewhere.

01:33:18.480 --> 01:33:20.440
They kept
running, you fucking idiots.

01:33:20.800 --> 01:33:22.404
Shit, are they still there?

01:33:22.480 --> 01:33:24.005
I think they're gone.
Are they gone?

01:33:24.040 --> 01:33:25.963
Oh, my God. Why did
Franco flip off Danny?

01:33:26.040 --> 01:33:27.644
Why did he have
to do that, man?

01:33:27.720 --> 01:33:28.767
He was in the clear.

01:33:28.840 --> 01:33:30.365
That is textbook.

01:33:30.440 --> 01:33:31.965
Vanity or...

01:33:32.040 --> 01:33:33.280
Is it vanity?
Vanity or envy.

01:33:33.360 --> 01:33:34.725
Is it envy or wrath?

01:33:34.800 --> 01:33:36.848
It's any of them, man.
You can't do that.

01:33:36.920 --> 01:33:38.490
It's being a sore winner,
is what it is,

01:33:38.560 --> 01:33:39.891
more than anything.
That's exactly what it is.

01:33:39.960 --> 01:33:41.200
You can't be a sore winner. No.

01:33:41.760 --> 01:33:45.526
Well, this is another fine
mess we found ourselves in.

01:33:48.920 --> 01:33:50.081
Fuck.

01:33:50.520 --> 01:33:51.726

01:33:51.880 --> 01:33:53.689
Oh, shit.

01:33:55.760 --> 01:33:57.922
Get out of here,
let's get out of here.

01:34:02.240 --> 01:34:05.403
Oh, you've got to be
fucking shitting me!

01:34:05.560 --> 01:34:09.201
Oh, my God.
Oh, no.

01:34:09.280 --> 01:34:10.486
That thing's big.

01:34:10.560 --> 01:34:11.686
Holy shit.

01:34:11.760 --> 01:34:13.046

Oh, man.
Oh, Jesus.

01:34:25.200 --> 01:34:26.326
We're gonna die, man.
Okay.

01:34:26.400 --> 01:34:27.481
Okay, we're gonna die.
Uh...

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:34.923
Jesus!
Oh, no!

01:34:40.600 --> 01:34:41.761
Shit.
Listen to me, man.

01:34:41.840 --> 01:34:44.571
I'm a fucking idiot.
I put myself up.

01:34:44.640 --> 01:34:45.971
I'm self-righteous.

01:34:46.080 --> 01:34:47.570
I think I'm better than you.
No, no.

01:34:47.640 --> 01:34:48.801
I was resistant to change.

01:34:48.920 --> 01:34:50.888
No. I should have
grown with you.

01:34:50.960 --> 01:34:52.928
I should have changed with you.

01:34:53.040 --> 01:34:54.326
We should have
changed together.

01:34:54.400 --> 01:34:57.768
I didn't like what I became
so I hated what you became.

01:34:57.840 --> 01:34:59.604
It's fine, man.
It's fine.

01:34:59.720 --> 01:35:01.529
I love you, Seth, fucking love you, buddy.
I love you, man.

01:35:01.640 --> 01:35:03.085
I always loved you. Let's
die together, man.

01:35:03.160 --> 01:35:05.003
Let's die together.
I love you, Jay.

01:35:15.760 --> 01:35:17.205
Holy shit, Jay, all right!

01:35:17.280 --> 01:35:18.327
Yeah, we did it!

01:35:18.440 --> 01:35:19.805
I'm not getting
sucked up into Heaven!

01:35:19.880 --> 01:35:21.086
What do you mean?
Why not?

01:35:21.160 --> 01:35:22.764
I don't know why not!

01:35:22.840 --> 01:35:23.921
Take my hand!

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:25.240
Okay, take me with you, Jay!

01:35:25.320 --> 01:35:26.890
I'll take you with me.

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:28.490

01:35:48.960 --> 01:35:51.247
He can't touch us!

01:35:51.320 --> 01:35:52.924

01:35:57.160 --> 01:35:59.686
Oh, shit! Shit!

01:36:03.480 --> 01:36:05.084
It's not gonna
take me with you!

01:36:05.160 --> 01:36:06.286
We're going down!

01:36:06.360 --> 01:36:09.284
Keep holding on and you'll
get pulled up, too!

01:36:09.360 --> 01:36:11.283
It's not!
No, I won't, man!

01:36:11.360 --> 01:36:13.044

you back anymore.
