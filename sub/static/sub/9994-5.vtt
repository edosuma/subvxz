00:03.000 --> 00:05.500
ALLISON:
<i>when I was?????
Mrs Water</i>

00:05.500 --> 00:07.400
 <i>she???? bring me
her daughter's old clothes.</i>

00:07.500 --> 00:09.300
 <i>I never wanted to wear them.</i>

00:10.200 --> 00:12.300
 <i>It wasn't that I didn't</i>
 <i>like the clothes,</i>

00:12.300 --> 00:15.300
 <i>it was the way they made me</i>
 <i>feel whenever I put them on.</i>

00:16.600 --> 00:18.450
 <i>Later, I found out that</i>

00:18.450 --> 00:20.850
 <i>when Mrs. Walters' little girl</i>
 <i>would misbehave,</i>

00:21.000 --> 00:23.967
 <i>she would lock her</i>
 <i>in a dark closet.</i>

00:27.650 --> 00:29.884
 <i>Then there was the time</i>
 <i>I was about to sit down</i>

00:29.917 --> 00:31.200
 <i>on the couch</i>
 <i>and watch television,</i>

00:31.500 --> 00:34.000
 <i>and suddenly, I got</i>
 <i>the distinct impression</i>

00:34.800 --> 00:38.800
 <i>that things between my mother</i>
 <i>and her latest boyfriend had...</i>

00:39.900 --> 00:41.700
 <i>moved to the next level.</i>

00:47.000 --> 00:50.200
 <i>My point being, that sometimes</i>
 <i>the energy from an event</i>

00:50.200 --> 00:52.100
 <i>can hang around</i>
 <i>a particular object</i>

00:52.100 --> 00:53.800
 <i>long after the event is over.</i>

00:54.600 --> 00:57.000
 <i>Almost like an imprint.</i>

00:57.300 --> 01:00.500
 <i>And people like me,</i>
 <i>people who are sensitive,</i>

01:01.600 --> 01:04.700
 <i>it's almost as if we can</i>
 <i>read the energy</i>

01:05.200 --> 01:06.400
 <i>and know what happened.</i>

01:08.000 --> 01:09.600
 <i>Like the time Bobby Page</i>

01:09.600 --> 01:11.800
 <i>taught me to shoot</i>
 <i>with his dad's rifle,</i>

01:13.800 --> 01:16.400
 <i>not knowing his dad had just</i>
 <i>used it to put down</i>

01:16.400 --> 01:18.300
 <i>their old retriever, Buck.</i>

01:20.200 --> 01:23.300
 <i>Yeah, that was</i>
 <i>a particularly bad energy.</i>

01:31.000 --> 01:33.500
 <i>And it isn't just the energy</i>
 <i>of other people's things,</i>

01:33.900 --> 01:35.700
 <i>other people's behavior,</i>

01:35.800 --> 01:37.800
 <i>that comes flooding</i>
 <i>back to me at times.</i>

01:43.633 --> 01:45.533
What? What?
What is it?

01:45.566 --> 01:47.500
 <i>The trick, I've learned,</i>
 <i>is to try to figure out</i>

01:47.500 --> 01:50.900
 <i>why the object is sharing</i>
 <i>that energy with you,</i>

01:51.000 --> 01:52.800
 <i>what the message might be,</i>

01:53.134 --> 01:58.900
 <i>and then, hopefully,</i>
 <i>behave accordingly.</i>

<font color="#ffff00">sync:FRM@LePetitPrince</font>

02:52.100 --> 02:53.100
You okay?

02:54.200 --> 02:55.700
It's 3:15 in the morning.

02:56.300 --> 02:58.200
It's never God's plan
for people to be up

02:58.233 --> 02:59.434
at 3:15 in the morning.

02:59.467 --> 03:00.567
I'm sorry.

03:00.600 --> 03:01.700
They want to clean up
the blood

03:01.700 --> 03:03.400
and open the road
before the morning rush.

03:04.100 --> 03:06.600
I knew you'd want to see it all
before they carted it away.

03:09.700 --> 03:10.800
You sure she
wasn't drunk?

03:11.600 --> 03:13.500
She was heading east
around 11:20.

03:13.500 --> 03:15.100
Light traffic, looks
like she was going

03:15.100 --> 03:16.200
between 20 and 30.

03:19.200 --> 03:20.600
One in the head,
two in the chest.

03:22.200 --> 03:23.900
I don't think she even
knew what hit her.

03:24.700 --> 03:26.400
Somebody shoot her
from a passing car?

03:28.100 --> 03:29.700
I'm guessing it was up
on that walkway there.

03:30.600 --> 03:32.800
what do you mean?
That's half
a football field away.

03:35.700 --> 03:38.800
You saying we have a highway
sniper and nobody saw him?

03:42.699 --> 03:44.165
So, how old
are you, Daddy?

03:44.800 --> 03:47.100
I'm old, kiddo, I'm really old.

03:47.100 --> 03:48.100
No, you're not.

03:48.633 --> 03:49.966
Mommy, I don't understand.

03:50.000 --> 03:52.399
Why can't Daddy open
his birthday presents now?

03:52.432 --> 03:53.966
'Cause that's not
how we do it.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.833
We don't open birthday
presents in the morning.

03:55.866 --> 03:57.032
We do on Christmas.

03:57.065 --> 03:58.299
Yeah, but this
isn't Christmas,

03:58.332 --> 03:59.799
this is Daddy's birthday.

03:59.900 --> 04:01.766
You ever seen anyone
put a birthday candle

04:01.799 --> 04:03.500
in a bowl of
breakfast cereal?

04:03.700 --> 04:05.300
No.
Want to know why?

04:05.400 --> 04:06.500
'Cause we don't open

04:06.500 --> 04:07.967
birthday presents
in the morning.

04:08.000 --> 04:11.200
Let me let you in on
a little secret, Bridge...

04:11.500 --> 04:14.200
I think it's really 'cause Mommy
likes to procrastinate.

04:14.200 --> 04:15.100
Really?

04:15.500 --> 04:17.000
What's that?
It's when someone

04:17.000 --> 04:19.132
puts off doing things
that they really need to do.

04:19.166 --> 04:20.200
Precisely.

04:20.700 --> 04:23.400
I think the real reason
I can't open my presents

04:24.300 --> 04:26.634
is because Mommy
hasn't actually gotten around

04:26.667 --> 04:28.100
to getting me one yet.

04:28.133 --> 04:30.500
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

04:35.300 --> 04:36.100
Good morning.

04:36.600 --> 04:38.367
Hi. Um, do you
have the ad

04:38.400 --> 04:39.734
that ran in this
morning's paper?

04:39.767 --> 04:40.834
Oh, sure.

04:45.534 --> 04:47.501
Anything I can help
you with in there?

04:47.534 --> 04:49.300
I'm interested in this.

04:49.334 --> 04:50.334
That's a great machine.

04:50.367 --> 04:51.567
Would you like to see one?

04:51.601 --> 04:52.601
Sure.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.400
It says to ask about pricing.

04:55.500 --> 04:56.500
1099.

04:56.500 --> 04:57.800
$1100?

04:58.034 --> 04:59.200
Believe it or not,
our competitors

04:59.200 --> 05:00.934
have them for $1349.

05:01.600 --> 05:03.200
Not what you
had budgeted?

05:05.000 --> 05:06.200
What were you
looking to spend?

05:06.700 --> 05:08.600
Half of that, or less.

05:09.900 --> 05:13.999
Now this is a $1,200 camera,
too, <i>but...</i>

05:14.033 --> 05:15.999
far superior to the one

05:16.033 --> 05:17.300
you wanted to buy.

05:18.867 --> 05:22.066
Comes specially equipped
with a 12 to one zoom lens.

05:22.099 --> 05:25.900
That's like have a video camera
on the end of a telescope.

05:25.934 --> 05:28.266
It's excellent in
low light situations.

05:28.500 --> 05:32.200
This is the Rolls Royce
of video cameras.

05:32.800 --> 05:34.200
I'll let you have it for $500.

05:37.966 --> 05:39.700
Okay, why would you do that?

05:41.000 --> 05:42.533
Every one of these
that I sell,

05:42.567 --> 05:43.934
comes right back
to the store.

05:43.967 --> 05:46.466
It's an excellent
piece of gear, it's just

05:46.500 --> 05:47.600
too damn complicated

05:47.633 --> 05:49.466
for your average
point and shoot customer.

05:49.500 --> 05:50.567
And nobody wants to read

05:50.600 --> 05:52.233
operating manuals anymore,
you know.

05:53.200 --> 05:55.300
We're just gonna send them
back to the manufacturer.

05:55.333 --> 05:56.200
And frankly,

05:56.200 --> 05:58.100
I would much rather
sell it to you,

05:58.100 --> 05:59.700
hopefully make a new customer,

05:59.733 --> 06:02.000
and save some money
on shipping.

06:03.600 --> 06:04.800
Let me run to the back.

06:04.833 --> 06:07.133
I'll get a battery,
blank DVD, let you play.

06:15.200 --> 06:16.000
MAN:
Hello.

06:16.400 --> 06:18.200
Ooh, face the camera, sweetie.

06:18.800 --> 06:20.800
Yeah, thank you.

06:21.800 --> 06:22.800
What's up?

06:23.233 --> 06:24.333
Roll over.

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
Come on, you want to,
you want to do it.

06:27.034 --> 06:29.000
You want to roll over.
Thank you.
WOMAN:
Hey!

06:29.000 --> 06:31.900
Hey, you, camera guy,
I'm talking to you.

06:33.667 --> 06:35.100
What's your deal, camera guy?

06:36.967 --> 06:39.267
What do... wh...
what do you mean?

06:40.600 --> 06:41.700
What do I mean?

06:41.900 --> 06:43.400
What do you think I mean?

06:43.433 --> 06:46.300
I mean, I've been coming to this
park for three days in a row.

06:46.333 --> 06:47.133
And for three days in a row,

06:47.133 --> 06:48.900
I've seen you trying
to take pictures of me.

06:49.300 --> 06:50.700
I don't like it.

06:53.700 --> 06:56.200
Oh, okay, so what,
now you have nothing to say?

06:58.500 --> 06:59.300
What's your name?

07:00.633 --> 07:02.366
I'm thinking your name
must be Dick.

07:02.900 --> 07:05.400
Do you mind if I call you
"Dick," Dick?

07:07.366 --> 07:09.500
Big brave guy with a camera.

07:10.700 --> 07:13.300
Go ahead, Dick, tilt down.

07:14.867 --> 07:16.000
You know you want to.

07:18.034 --> 07:22.800
Tilt down, Dick.

07:24.000 --> 07:30.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:31.633 --> 07:33.200
All right, that's enough.

07:34.400 --> 07:36.400
Now, you got what you needed?

07:36.433 --> 07:38.020
I'm out of here.
Uh, miss.

07:38.266 --> 07:39.300
Wait! Miss!
Don't go!

07:39.333 --> 07:40.333
SALESMAN:
Ready to play?

07:42.800 --> 07:44.000
How's it feel to you?

07:44.133 --> 07:46.300
Small, light, it's
terrific, right?

07:47.000 --> 07:48.400
Just wait till I
put this battery in,

07:48.400 --> 07:50.233
power up, show you
what she really can do.

07:50.300 --> 07:52.300
Careful, I think there might
already be one in there.

07:52.366 --> 07:54.166
Uh, no, actually,
it's impossible.

07:54.199 --> 07:56.733
You can't put the DVD in
until you put the battery in.

07:56.767 --> 07:58.333
And I just put
the battery in.

07:58.366 --> 08:00.000
Go ahead.

08:08.300 --> 08:09.300
I'll take it??????

08:20.000 --> 08:22.667
MAN:
Kathy, come on, I haven't got
all day, get in there.

08:22.701 --> 08:24.434
I'm using up the tape.

08:24.467 --> 08:27.067
I can't keep photographing
an empty bed.

08:27.800 --> 08:28.700
Kathy...

08:30.400 --> 08:31.200
Get in there.

08:31.600 --> 08:33.299
No.
Get in there.
I'm using up

08:33.333 --> 08:34.200
the battery.

08:34.534 --> 08:38.400
You are so predictable
with this video thing.

08:38.400 --> 08:39.500
Yeah, what does
that mean?

08:39.801 --> 08:41.100
What do you think it means?

08:41.133 --> 08:43.933
It means it's just
completely predictable.

08:43.966 --> 08:46.600
You're completely predictable.

08:46.634 --> 08:49.200
Does that mean you
don't love me anymore?

08:50.567 --> 08:54.133
(sighs):
Oh... it means...

08:54.167 --> 08:57.000
I better be the only one
that you videotape

08:58.500 --> 09:00.500
from now until the end of time.

09:01.400 --> 09:02.900
That's what it means,
camera guy.

09:03.100 --> 09:04.300
And what else?

09:06.000 --> 09:08.200
It means...

09:09.300 --> 09:10.800
Kathy loves Travis.

09:10.800 --> 09:12.500
Louder.
Kathy loves Travis!

09:12.534 --> 09:13.400
Say it loud!

09:14.600 --> 09:15.600
DEVALOS:
Allison?

09:16.700 --> 09:17.500
You busy?

09:18.300 --> 09:20.450
Birthday present for Joe.

09:20.500 --> 09:21.299
Just wrapping it.

09:22.200 --> 09:24.800
Well, we're all summoned
to the conference room.

09:24.834 --> 09:26.301
I know not why.

09:26.335 --> 09:28.500
Maggie played cards at the club.

09:28.534 --> 09:30.701
Every Wednesday night, 8:45.

09:32.767 --> 09:34.868
Game ended at 11:00.
It had to.

09:34.901 --> 09:36.734
That's when they
closed the room.

09:38.767 --> 09:41.300
She was always
home by 11:25.

09:41.567 --> 09:43.214
11:30,
(door opens)

09:43.367 --> 09:45.000
I call her cell phone.
It goes straight

09:45.000 --> 09:46.500
to voice mail,
so, okay,

09:47.300 --> 09:49.100
she forgot to put
the damn thing on.

09:49.868 --> 09:51.367
By quarter to 12:00,

09:51.400 --> 09:52.500
I start to get anxious.

09:52.700 --> 09:54.900
So I call the other girls--
Camille, Lorraine, Rhonda.
They're all home.

09:56.401 --> 09:59.100
I don't know what
else to do, so I keep

09:59.600 --> 10:00.400
calling the cell phone.

10:01.200 --> 10:03.000
And then I call the police.

10:03.000 --> 10:04.000
No help.

10:05.000 --> 10:06.100
No offense.

10:07.000 --> 10:07.600
So...

10:08.700 --> 10:09.600
tried her cell again.

10:11.700 --> 10:15.600
And this time, I got
an EMS guy who answered.

10:24.266 --> 10:26.400
I met Mr. Caffey when
he came in this morning

10:26.400 --> 10:27.500
to identify his wife.

10:28.800 --> 10:29.800
I assured him
that we're doing

10:30.000 --> 10:31.600
everything we can to find

10:31.932 --> 10:34.200
this animal.

10:37.000 --> 10:38.800
We all drive the same streets.

10:41.266 --> 10:42.200
Our loved ones

10:42.800 --> 10:44.800
all drive
the same streets.

10:46.932 --> 10:48.500
Oh, how do I smell?

10:48.633 --> 10:50.667
Like the cool mist
of the ocean.

10:50.700 --> 10:52.533
Hmm, just like
the box says.

10:52.566 --> 10:53.899
Thank you, honey.

10:53.932 --> 10:55.099
Happy birthday,
Daddy.

10:55.133 --> 10:56.233
Thank you, sweetie.

10:56.266 --> 10:57.200
Open mine!
Open mine!

10:57.200 --> 10:58.000
Open mine!

10:58.000 --> 11:00.400
Wow, is this for me?

11:01.100 --> 11:02.200
Is it a car?

11:02.200 --> 11:05.000
No, and you did
that joke last year.

11:05.233 --> 11:06.200
He does that joke every year.

11:06.200 --> 11:08.000
That's how we know
he's a year older.

11:09.100 --> 11:11.100
It's beautiful.

11:11.300 --> 11:12.900
I made it.
You're kidding.

11:13.100 --> 11:14.150
Do you know
what it is?

11:14.300 --> 11:16.400
Yes, I do, but I'm not
going to tell you.

11:16.733 --> 11:17.500
She thinks
it's an ashtray.

11:17.500 --> 11:18.500
Ariel!

11:18.600 --> 11:20.600
That is so otherworldly.

11:20.600 --> 11:22.300
This is so what
I was hoping for.

11:22.800 --> 11:24.000
You don't even smoke.

11:24.100 --> 11:26.000
And I never will,
but I can still appreciate

11:26.200 --> 11:28.300
a beautifully made ashtray.

11:29.200 --> 11:30.200
Thank you, honey.

11:30.900 --> 11:33.400
I am going to put this
on my desk at work,

11:33.433 --> 11:35.500
right next to the one
you gave me last year.

11:35.500 --> 11:37.600
Here's a little something
from me and Marie.

11:37.700 --> 11:38.800
Also not a car.

11:42.400 --> 11:43.500
You shouldn't have.

11:43.700 --> 11:46.100
Oh, my.

11:46.565 --> 11:48.100
Oh, come on.

11:48.199 --> 11:49.969
Oh, wow, look at this.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.166
Awesome!

11:51.199 --> 11:53.266
Now this is even better
than the one

11:53.299 --> 11:55.099
that I showed you
in the paper.

11:55.800 --> 11:57.199
Wow, this one has
all the bells

11:57.233 --> 11:58.266
and whistles.

11:58.299 --> 11:59.300
Don't look at me.

11:59.300 --> 12:00.000
Marie picked it out.

12:00.000 --> 12:04.700
Whoa. I can't even imagine
how much this cost.

12:05.599 --> 12:07.700
So which of the girls
isn't going to college?

12:09.665 --> 12:10.900
Where is...?

12:14.866 --> 12:15.689
Well, that's it.

12:15.689 --> 12:17.000
There's no bonus gift.

12:17.000 --> 12:18.800
I'm not looking
for a bonus gift.

12:19.066 --> 12:20.466
You outdid yourself.

12:20.466 --> 12:21.500
And you, too!

12:21.699 --> 12:23.900
Oh, how did you know?

12:24.099 --> 12:27.066
Mm-mm-mm!

12:27.400 --> 12:29.133
No, I just thought

12:29.166 --> 12:31.300
that maybe they included
a blank DVD

12:31.300 --> 12:32.665
for you to record on.

12:32.699 --> 12:33.766
Oh, my gosh, you're kidding?

12:33.799 --> 12:35.166
There's nothing
to record on in there?

12:35.199 --> 12:36.366
I didn't even think to ask.

12:36.400 --> 12:37.200
That doesn't matter.

12:37.200 --> 12:39.400
I can wait to record something
till tomorrow.

12:39.400 --> 12:41.199
This is clearly
an amazing camera.

12:41.233 --> 12:45.699
I got me some amazing cologne
and an amazing ashtray.

12:45.732 --> 12:49.333
And an amazing little
raspberry right here.

12:49.366 --> 12:50.480
 <i>Sorry about the DVDs.</i>

12:50.480 --> 12:51.800
I'll grab some tomorrow.

12:52.200 --> 12:54.066
It was a great
birthday.

12:54.900 --> 12:55.900
Really?

12:58.033 --> 12:58.800
I'm glad.

12:59.433 --> 13:01.700
I'm so glad
you thought so.

13:02.700 --> 13:04.199
I was worried
you would think

13:04.233 --> 13:06.000
I didn't put enough
thought into it.

13:08.900 --> 13:09.932
I always think,

13:11.400 --> 13:12.800
"This year I'll
be different.

13:14.699 --> 13:17.900
"This year I'll whisk
him off his feet,

13:19.000 --> 13:20.700
"take him to the pyramids,

13:21.932 --> 13:23.599
"buy him box seats

13:23.632 --> 13:25.999
"for some great sports
team or something.

13:26.033 --> 13:27.565
Mm...

13:27.599 --> 13:30.166
Make him a gourmet meal."

13:30.199 --> 13:31.000
Mm...

13:33.100 --> 13:36.000
And then I run around
the day of

13:37.600 --> 13:38.990
getting your present,

13:39.000 --> 13:41.100
making you a cake
from a mix...

13:42.966 --> 13:46.666
worrying that you'll
think I don't care.

13:51.366 --> 13:52.666
I was driving
home tonight,

13:54.466 --> 13:56.022
the sun had already set,

13:57.600 --> 14:01.500
and every building that
I passed, every bridge

14:02.400 --> 14:06.500
every water tower,
I was thinking,

14:08.599 --> 14:09.700
"Is he there?"

14:12.299 --> 14:15.600
And you could just
feel that every person

14:15.600 --> 14:17.665
and every car around me,

14:17.699 --> 14:19.532
they were thinking
the same thing:

14:19.565 --> 14:20.500
"Is he out there?

14:22.500 --> 14:25.000
Is he thinking about
shooting at my car?"

14:26.700 --> 14:27.500
At me.

14:29.300 --> 14:31.200
Doesn't he know
it's my birthday?

14:34.100 --> 14:35.900
Doesn't he know
I have to get home

14:37.200 --> 14:38.900
so Bridgette can give me
her ashtray?

15:24.500 --> 15:26.433
MAN:
Come on, baby,
get up there.

15:26.466 --> 15:28.532
WOMAN:
No, Travis,
I don't want to.

15:28.565 --> 15:31.699
Come on. It's just
you and me here.

15:31.732 --> 15:34.500
I want to see you
on camera.

15:34.532 --> 15:36.433
It's too embarrassing.

15:36.466 --> 15:39.500
I don't want anyone
to see this online.

15:39.532 --> 15:43.500
Kathy, don't you
trust me, baby?

15:43.532 --> 15:47.433
If you really love me,
you'll do this for me.

15:47.466 --> 15:51.665
Travis, I don't
want to do this, okay?

15:51.699 --> 15:53.033
Can you just get
in there

15:53.066 --> 15:54.799
so I have something
to focus on?

15:54.832 --> 15:56.732
I've never used this
tripod thing before.

16:01.999 --> 16:03.333
Travis, did you hear me?

16:03.366 --> 16:05.466
I don't want to do this, okay?

16:05.500 --> 16:08.500
I mean, I'll do this.

16:08.500 --> 16:11.100
I'll do anything, but I don't
want you to tape it, all right?

16:11.100 --> 16:13.300
I'm not asking you
to do anything

16:13.300 --> 16:14.100
that I'm not gonna do.

16:14.700 --> 16:16.366
No, you shouldn't tape it, okay?

16:16.400 --> 16:17.200
Not tonight.

16:17.466 --> 16:18.600
Why?
It's gonna be fun.

16:19.300 --> 16:20.700
Listen, nobody's
gonna see it.

16:21.000 --> 16:25.000
I mean, you're beautiful,
but you're not famous.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
I mean, no offense,
but you ain't exactly
Paris Hilton

16:27.000 --> 16:28.150
I'm not Colin Farrell.

16:28.150 --> 16:29.800
Now give me something
to focus on.

16:46.400 --> 16:47.700
What the hell is that?

16:50.099 --> 16:52.033
I told you I didn't want
to tape it.

17:08.800 --> 17:10.099
What are you
showing me?

17:13.299 --> 17:14.732
He knows something's up.

17:17.650 --> 17:18.849
Last night, he came home,

17:19.098 --> 17:21.300
said he couldn't reach me
for hours.

17:23.500 --> 17:25.300
He beat the living crap
out of me.

17:28.500 --> 17:29.900
No, don't.

17:32.900 --> 17:34.600
I told him I got
a call, you know,

17:34.966 --> 17:37.400
to do temp work
at the V.A. Hospital,

17:37.400 --> 17:38.500
but he didn't believe me.

17:39.800 --> 17:43.000
He said he could
smell you on me.

17:44.400 --> 17:45.900
Not you, but someone.

17:46.433 --> 17:47.400
Said the next time

17:47.433 --> 17:48.609
he'd kill me.

17:51.299 --> 17:53.500
Do it with drugs.
No one would ever know.

17:56.999 --> 17:58.900
Sometimes I lie
in bed at night,

18:01.700 --> 18:03.700
I lie next to him
and I think about...

18:06.199 --> 18:09.900
what my life would be like
if he were gone...

18:13.366 --> 18:14.200
if he were dead.

18:22.565 --> 18:24.000
Is it something
you want?

18:31.665 --> 18:33.700
I can't let him hurt
you anymore, Kathy.

18:40.500 --> 18:43.000
Shouldn't you maybe shut off
the tape?

18:53.400 --> 18:54.967
Kathy and Travis.

18:55.000 --> 18:56.800
Any particular Kathy
and Travis?

18:56.800 --> 18:59.500
I just know,
at least I strongly suspect

18:59.500 --> 19:01.567
they're going to attempt
to kill her husband.

19:01.600 --> 19:03.200
He's a doctor.
There must be some way

19:03.200 --> 19:05.500
to research doctors
with wives named "Kathy."

19:05.700 --> 19:07.833
I'm pretty sure
they're from this area.
Why's that?

19:07.866 --> 19:09.500
I bought my husband
a video camera

19:09.533 --> 19:11.033
for his birthday
from Archibald's.

19:11.066 --> 19:13.933
Before there were batteries
in it, before there was anything

19:13.966 --> 19:17.533
to record on, I started to see
videos of this couple

19:17.567 --> 19:18.933
on the viewfinder screen.

19:18.966 --> 19:20.567
Kathy and Travis?

19:20.600 --> 19:24.066
I think perhaps they owned
the camera before I did.

19:24.100 --> 19:27.233
I think the camera remembers
what it saw

19:27.267 --> 19:28.500
and it's showing it to me

19:28.500 --> 19:30.000
so we could stop this thing
from happening.

19:30.000 --> 19:31.667
Okay, it's showing
you all this,

19:31.700 --> 19:33.267
but it's not giving
you last names.

19:33.300 --> 19:34.533
It's showing you
all this,

19:34.567 --> 19:36.200
but it's not telling you
where or when

19:36.233 --> 19:37.799
this killing
might take place.

19:37.833 --> 19:40.033
Allison, maybe
you haven't noticed,

19:40.066 --> 19:41.799
but the city's come
to a standstill.

19:41.833 --> 19:43.900
We're in the middle
of a bona fide crisis.

19:46.500 --> 19:49.000
Give me a name,
first and last.

19:50.100 --> 19:52.900
Better yet, buy a camera
that has videos of this madman

19:52.900 --> 19:54.800
who's using our streets
for target practice.

19:56.000 --> 19:57.500
That would be truly helpful.

20:02.000 --> 20:03.300
He loved it, right?

20:04.200 --> 20:06.300
Someone owned this camera
before I did, didn't they?

20:07.000 --> 20:07.800
Ma'am?

20:07.800 --> 20:10.000
You told me people
were bringing them
back to the store,

20:10.000 --> 20:12.033
but you never explained
that someone actually used

20:12.066 --> 20:13.734
this specific camera you sold me

20:13.766 --> 20:14.619
before I bought it.

20:14.799 --> 20:16.100
Well, I don't know
that to be true.

20:16.100 --> 20:16.800
Well, I do.

20:16.800 --> 20:18.600
I need the name
of the previous owner.

20:18.600 --> 20:20.300
Ma'am, I can assure you

20:20.300 --> 20:23.400
if by some chance someone
purchased the camera before you

20:23.400 --> 20:24.667
and returned it
to the store,

20:24.700 --> 20:27.167
it passed the most rigorous
of inspections

20:27.201 --> 20:29.149
before being returned
to inventory.

20:29.200 --> 20:31.367
It's completely covered
by manufacturer's warranty.

20:31.400 --> 20:32.866
I don't care about
the manufacturer's warranty.

20:32.899 --> 20:35.533
I just need the name of the
person who owned it before me.

20:36.330 --> 20:38.633
Furthermore, as I offered
at time of purchase,

20:38.667 --> 20:40.500
I'd be happy
to take the machine back,

20:40.533 --> 20:42.367
swap it out for
an easier-to-use model.

20:42.400 --> 20:44.266
His first name was Travis.
He had brown hair.

20:44.500 --> 20:46.300
Ma'am, I'm not saying

20:46.300 --> 20:48.000
that someone else did buy
your camera,

20:48.000 --> 20:48.900
before you, but if they did,

20:49.933 --> 20:51.433
I still couldn't tell you
their name.

20:51.467 --> 20:53.217
I'm with the District Attorney's
office.

20:53.600 --> 20:57.300
That's all well and good,
but, um, you're gonna need

20:57.300 --> 20:58.400
to speak to a manager.

20:59.100 --> 21:01.000
I mean, do you have
a warrant or something?

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
Did he not bring it back?
Did a girl bring it back?

21:03.000 --> 21:04.850
Kathy-- brown hair, pretty?

21:05.400 --> 21:06.367
I don't get it.

21:06.401 --> 21:07.867
Are you not happy
with the camera?

21:09.733 --> 21:10.800
Uh!

21:13.934 --> 21:15.000
I need some recordable DVDs.

21:16.400 --> 21:17.533
DINOVI:
Basically what the Mayor

21:17.567 --> 21:19.600
and the City Attorney
want you to weigh in on is...

21:19.633 --> 21:21.867
Is if we assign a
disproportionate share

21:21.900 --> 21:23.450
of police to monitor
the neighborhoods

21:23.450 --> 21:24.622
where the wealthy people live--

21:24.700 --> 21:27.301
what's our exposure if our
sniper friend shoots someone

21:27.334 --> 21:30.800
in a poor neighborhood and their
family decides to sue the city.

21:31.300 --> 21:32.967
Want to hear
a scary thought?

21:33.001 --> 21:35.234
Which is also a great thought?

21:35.267 --> 21:36.734
What if he never shoots again?

21:36.767 --> 21:38.500
What's scary about that?

21:38.533 --> 21:39.700
Between you and me?

21:40.400 --> 21:41.800
If he doesn't make
another try,

21:41.800 --> 21:43.200
I don't think there's a whole
hell of a lot of hope

21:43.200 --> 21:44.500
we're ever going to catch him.

21:44.600 --> 21:46.400
The evidence he left behind
the other night

21:47.300 --> 21:48.368
isn't leading us anywhere.

21:52.800 --> 21:55.000
On the other hand, I suppose
I'd rather have

21:55.000 --> 21:58.227
one unsolved murder than two
or three or four or five.

21:58.300 --> 22:00.277
Hell, I'd rather have
one unsolved murder

22:00.300 --> 22:02.000
then two or three solved ones.

22:02.000 --> 22:04.200
I just invited Sean Caffey
back down here

22:04.200 --> 22:05.000
for a little conversation.

22:05.000 --> 22:06.200
Thought you might want
to listen in

22:06.200 --> 22:07.500
from the other side
of the glass...

22:08.100 --> 22:09.099
You're having
a conversation with him

22:09.133 --> 22:10.333
in the interrogation room?

22:10.366 --> 22:12.400
That's a hell of a way
to treat a widower

22:12.433 --> 22:14.300
two days after his
wife is shot to death.

22:15.166 --> 22:16.333
Maybe.

22:16.366 --> 22:18.199
Apparently, there was
trouble in the marriage,

22:18.233 --> 22:20.333
but there was also
a solid prenup in place.

22:20.366 --> 22:23.500
In the event of divorce,
Sean would get nothing.

22:23.533 --> 22:25.300
How much is she worth
to him dead?

22:25.800 --> 22:27.300
Between the inheritance and
insurance pay outs--

22:27.300 --> 22:28.500
about $30 million.

22:30.000 --> 22:32.500
So he bought himself
a long-range rifle,

22:33.266 --> 22:34.700
got up on that
pedestrian bridge

22:35.200 --> 22:37.400
and, boy, talk
about a lucky shot.

22:37.400 --> 22:38.500
He's rich.

22:38.965 --> 22:40.500
They hire people to do
their dirty work.

22:40.600 --> 22:44.000
Sounds improbable,
but not impossible.

22:44.300 --> 22:47.900
And as it happens we're
suffering from an acute shortage

22:47.900 --> 22:50.200
of leads in this particular
case, so , yeah, sure.

22:50.300 --> 22:51.267
I'll come with you.

22:52.000 --> 22:52.666
I'll pass.

22:53.200 --> 22:55.400
It's okay.
You weren't invited.

23:01.000 --> 23:02.267
Just an errand.

23:02.301 --> 23:03.568
Now that you're back,

23:03.601 --> 23:05.000
want to be my date
for an interrogation?

23:05.168 --> 23:06.000
I suppose.

23:09.600 --> 23:10.900
CAFFEY:
Where did you get these?

23:12.234 --> 23:13.800
Your wife hired
a private detective.

23:15.500 --> 23:16.450
Were you aware
that she was

23:16.450 --> 23:17.600
contemplating divorce?

23:19.400 --> 23:20.999
These photos are over
a year old.

23:21.033 --> 23:22.600
Maggie and I were
working things out.

23:22.633 --> 23:23.633
I don't understand.

23:23.667 --> 23:25.933
How is this relevant
to anything?

23:25.966 --> 23:28.217
Shouldn't you be out there
looking for a man with a gun?

23:28.217 --> 23:28.866
I don't know, Mr. Caffey.

23:28.899 --> 23:30.133
We're not sure who we should
be looking for.

23:30.166 --> 23:31.533
That's why we're having
this conversation.

23:31.567 --> 23:33.133
Should I be calling my lawyer?

23:33.166 --> 23:35.266
You have a lawyer?
Of your own?

23:35.300 --> 23:37.600
Because your late wife's family
made it very clear to me

23:37.633 --> 23:39.500
the family attorney had no
interest in helping you

23:39.533 --> 23:40.533
with this particular matter.

23:40.567 --> 23:42.000
What do you
make of him?

23:44.122 --> 23:46.159
I feel really stupid,
really useless.

23:46.700 --> 23:49.419
It's as if I'm not even
tuned in to the same channel.

23:50.000 --> 23:51.700
Everything I see
in my head

23:51.700 --> 23:54.450
has to do with those two kids
I told you about this morning.

23:54.600 --> 23:56.200
And their plan
to kill her husband.

23:57.333 --> 23:59.533
So talk to me about
being a player.

24:01.200 --> 24:02.700
How does that work?

24:05.033 --> 24:07.500
I mean, you marry
a really wealthy woman,

24:07.500 --> 24:08.700
she makes you sign
a prenup,

24:09.500 --> 24:11.600
and then what is it?
You just can't be faithful?

24:12.066 --> 24:13.500
Because from a monetary
standpoint,

24:13.500 --> 24:14.500
it makes no sense.

24:15.000 --> 24:16.466
You're really
playing with fire.

24:18.000 --> 24:21.000
Unless, of course,
you can make absolutely certain
that she won't divorce you,

24:21.000 --> 24:23.900
can't divorce you,
isn't alive to divorce you.

24:24.500 --> 24:25.700
I loved my wife.

24:26.200 --> 24:28.300
Where were you between
11:00 and 11:45

24:28.333 --> 24:29.732
on the night your
wife was slain?

24:29.766 --> 24:31.066
CAFFEY:
I've made no secret

24:31.099 --> 24:32.000
of where I was.

24:32.000 --> 24:34.500
I was at home,
trying to contact her.

24:34.500 --> 24:35.999
Then why didn't you use
the home phone?

24:36.033 --> 24:37.766
Why'd you keep calling her
from your cell phone?

24:37.799 --> 24:39.033
Because I was lazy.

24:39.066 --> 24:41.033
Because I had her mobile number
programmed into my cell.

24:41.066 --> 24:42.866
Because if I use the regular
phones at home

24:42.899 --> 24:45.000
I had to dial it,
but if I used my cell phone

24:45.000 --> 24:46.300
I just press one button.

24:47.766 --> 24:49.866
Do you think I don't know
how bad this sounds?

24:49.899 --> 24:52.133
The answer to all
your questions is "yes."

24:52.166 --> 24:54.466
Yes, I do think you
know how bad this sounds,

24:54.500 --> 24:56.133
yes you need a lawyer

24:56.166 --> 24:58.400
And yes, I know
you didn't ask,

24:58.400 --> 24:59.400
but I do believe you're
going to be

24:59.433 --> 25:01.000
spending the night
with us, Mr. Caffey.

25:03.400 --> 25:05.300
JOE:
I wonder who lives in here.

25:08.200 --> 25:09.200
Daddy.

25:10.300 --> 25:14.400
I'm making a documentary
on the nocturnal habits

25:14.400 --> 25:15.700
of eighth graders.

25:15.800 --> 25:17.400
Explain to our viewers at home

25:17.400 --> 25:18.966
what it is you're doing
right now.

25:19.000 --> 25:21.866
I'm doing geometry
and it's stupid.

25:21.899 --> 25:23.133
This is fascinating.

25:23.166 --> 25:24.333
I know I'm riveted.

25:26.033 --> 25:28.300
My name is Bridgette Dubois

25:28.333 --> 25:33.300
and I shall now dance
with a spoon on my...

25:33.333 --> 25:35.632
on my nose.

25:42.467 --> 25:44.400
Go away!

25:45.300 --> 25:46.000
JOE:
Honey...

25:46.033 --> 25:47.700
Go away!

25:47.899 --> 25:49.100
Honey, smile.

25:49.133 --> 25:50.266
This is Daddy's
birthday present

25:50.300 --> 25:52.499
and I need
you smile...
Go away!

25:52.532 --> 25:54.632
ALLISON:
I think she wants
you to go away.

25:55.700 --> 25:58.000
I bet you can't guess
who the only two people

25:58.033 --> 25:59.400
in this family are

25:59.433 --> 26:02.966
who haven't been
captured on DVD yet?

26:03.700 --> 26:04.400
Let me think about it.

26:06.900 --> 26:08.000
Time's up.

26:08.600 --> 26:10.300
What was that question again?

26:11.333 --> 26:16.600
Um, I... Are you forgetting
that yesterday was my birthday?

26:17.700 --> 26:18.632
Exactly.

26:18.666 --> 26:21.400
So ask me again
in 364 days.

26:22.433 --> 26:24.700
Hmm. Sorry, fella.

26:25.333 --> 26:27.730
I guess your work here
for tonight is through.

26:28.433 --> 26:30.000
I'm going to go
lock the door.

26:31.100 --> 26:33.100
And then I'm going
to go brush my teeth.

26:33.600 --> 26:37.300
No. Don't waste your time.

26:38.200 --> 26:39.700
I told you nothing's
going to happen.

26:40.033 --> 26:41.300
Hardy-har, har, har.

27:12.200 --> 27:13.700
TRAVIS:
So what am I looking for?

27:14.460 --> 27:15.500
KATHY:
A Mercedes.

27:15.600 --> 27:17.100
It'll be coming
towards you.

27:17.100 --> 27:19.699
It's 11 after 11:00 so it
should be any minute now.

27:20.600 --> 27:22.400
He plays cards every
Wednesday at his club.

27:22.666 --> 27:24.200
They close the place at 11:00.

27:26.900 --> 27:29.600
TRAVIS:
There's one.
I'm pretty sure there's one.

27:30.300 --> 27:32.700
KATHY:
Yeah. That's it.
I can tell from here.

27:32.700 --> 27:33.367
TRAVIS:
You sure?

27:33.400 --> 27:36.966
I'm absolutely sure.
That's him.

27:41.467 --> 27:42.167
Bang.

27:43.100 --> 27:45.100
Too bad this camera
doesn't have bullets.

27:46.369 --> 27:48.000
That was a joke.
I know.

27:48.000 --> 27:49.100
????????

27:49.100 --> 27:49.900
??????????

27:54.600 --> 27:56.667
So you're telling me
you believe

27:56.700 --> 27:58.400
these two lovers you've
been talking about...

27:58.433 --> 27:59.600
Kathy and Travis.

27:59.634 --> 28:01.901
...were trying to kill
Kathy's husband,

28:01.934 --> 28:05.700
but shot Sean Caffey's
wife by mistake?

28:08.800 --> 28:10.700
Well, it would certainly

28:10.700 --> 28:12.200
simplify things
if it were true.

28:12.300 --> 28:13.100
What do you mean?

28:13.800 --> 28:14.733
I mean, what
a relief

28:14.766 --> 28:17.000
if we're no longer dealing
with a homicidal maniac

28:17.000 --> 28:19.200
who's bent on shooting
people at random,

28:19.200 --> 28:21.100
but rather a single
act of passion.

28:22.222 --> 28:24.700
Of course, you don't know Kathy
and Travis' last name.

28:24.866 --> 28:27.300
So it's not like we can track
these people down,

28:27.300 --> 28:28.400
check this story out.

28:28.400 --> 28:29.567
Well, that's
the thing--

28:29.600 --> 28:31.600
when I saw them rehearsing
to kill this man,

28:31.800 --> 28:34.400
the wife Kathy kept talking
about this card game.

28:35.000 --> 28:36.400
How it had to end at 11:00.

28:36.700 --> 28:39.400
Sounded like the same card game
at the same club

28:39.400 --> 28:41.000
that Sean Caffey was
talking about.

28:41.000 --> 28:42.400
What's your point?

28:42.500 --> 28:46.166
Am I being naive, or isn't it
as simple as going to this club

28:46.199 --> 28:48.533
and asking them if they have
a member named Kathy

28:48.566 --> 28:50.000
who's married to a doctor?

28:52.166 --> 28:54.400
Anything to help solve
Mrs. Caffey's murder.

28:54.900 --> 28:56.700
Everyone around
here's devastated,

28:57.500 --> 28:58.600
as you can imagine.

28:59.350 --> 29:01.200
We're actually interested
in talking to some people

29:01.200 --> 29:02.867
we think may have
important information

29:02.900 --> 29:04.000
about the killing.

29:04.500 --> 29:06.633
People we believe to be
members of the club here.

29:06.667 --> 29:09.100
They're a couple.
The husband's a doctor.

29:09.300 --> 29:11.767
Drives a car very similar
to the one Mrs. Caffey drove--

29:12.300 --> 29:13.700
expensive black sedan.

29:14.400 --> 29:17.700
A lot of the gentlemen here
drive expensive black sedans.

29:18.500 --> 29:21.000
And any number of our
members are physicians.

29:21.900 --> 29:23.566
Can you tell me anything
else about him?

29:23.600 --> 29:26.100
He plays cards here
on Wednesdays at the club.

29:26.800 --> 29:28.400
His wife is named Kathy.

29:28.400 --> 29:30.266
She has brown hair,
maybe 25.

29:31.300 --> 29:32.700
Mrs. Dubois,

29:32.800 --> 29:34.900
I have been at this club
for almost 25 years.

29:34.967 --> 29:36.600
I know every member personally.

29:37.200 --> 29:39.100
And the only female
member named Kathy

29:39.100 --> 29:41.400
is a 63-year-old divorcee.

29:44.800 --> 29:46.067
Okay, so much for Kathy.

29:48.000 --> 29:49.700
Would it be possible to get
our hands on a list

29:49.700 --> 29:51.600
of the gentlemen who played
cards here last Wednesday?

29:51.767 --> 29:53.700
Maybe the Wednesday
before that as well?

29:54.400 --> 29:57.000
I'm sorry, but
there is no list.

29:57.300 --> 29:58.800
Wednesday is ladies only.

29:59.000 --> 30:00.800
Has been for
as long as
I've been here.

30:03.200 --> 30:04.900
If there's nothing
else for the moment,

30:04.900 --> 30:07.000
we have a luncheon
I really need to look in on.

30:08.200 --> 30:10.000
Of course.
We appreciate your help.

30:10.700 --> 30:13.160
If you need me, I'll
be in the clubhouse.

30:15.199 --> 30:16.500
What brand was that camera?

30:16.500 --> 30:18.200
I want to make sure
I don't get one of those.
I'm sorry.

30:19.000 --> 30:20.800
We should head back
to the ranch.
Hey...

30:24.600 --> 30:25.000
That's Kathy.

30:26.700 --> 30:27.700
What'd you say?

30:28.400 --> 30:29.800
ALLISON:
Excuse me, Miss.

30:29.800 --> 30:30.800
Waitress...

30:31.233 --> 30:32.733
Hey. Sorry, were
you calling me?

30:33.800 --> 30:34.700
What can I get
for you?

30:34.700 --> 30:36.000
Something to eat,
something to drink?

30:36.000 --> 30:37.000
Diana.

30:39.600 --> 30:40.600
Do I know you?

30:42.333 --> 30:43.700
Are you okay?

30:43.733 --> 30:44.500
Yeah, I'm okay.

30:44.500 --> 30:46.600
Just from over there
you look so familiar.

30:49.300 --> 30:51.220
Been here almost
a year and a half, so...

30:52.500 --> 30:54.200
Are you a member
or a guest, or...?

30:54.767 --> 30:56.000
A guest, a visitor.

30:56.700 --> 30:57.098
Oh.

30:57.099 --> 30:59.700
It's weird.
Has that ever happened to you?

31:00.400 --> 31:01.900
No, I'm certain
we've met.

31:02.500 --> 31:05.300
But your name wasn't Diana.

31:06.300 --> 31:08.100
I think you were
with your husband.

31:09.400 --> 31:11.700
Okay, if you say so.

31:12.600 --> 31:14.900
Only thing is,
I'm single.

31:15.000 --> 31:16.000
So...

31:18.600 --> 31:20.000
Are you sure I can't
get you anything?

31:20.000 --> 31:22.800
No, I'm fine, thanks.

31:23.033 --> 31:24.700
Okay, well, holler
of you need me.

31:25.800 --> 31:26.700
Okay.

31:26.900 --> 31:28.000
Who's that?
What'd you have to say?

31:28.532 --> 31:32.267
Her? Nothing, nobody.

31:37.800 --> 31:38.700
Sorry I'm late.

31:43.400 --> 31:45.000
Saved you some Chinese.

31:48.966 --> 31:51.500
Wow, someone had a bad day.

31:52.900 --> 31:54.100
I wasted half a day
at the golf course

31:54.900 --> 31:55.800
for no reason at all.

31:56.233 --> 31:58.799
Questioned someone I had
no business questioning.

31:59.600 --> 32:00.866
By the time I got back
to the office,

32:00.900 --> 32:03.133
there were all these
meetings about a sniper

32:03.166 --> 32:05.466
who seems to have
gone on vacation.

32:09.666 --> 32:10.766
Oh, man.

32:12.600 --> 32:13.600
I want to take that thing back.

32:13.700 --> 32:14.600
Oh, man.

32:14.600 --> 32:16.200
What thing? What are
you talking about?

32:19.134 --> 32:20.000
Girls.

32:21.700 --> 32:22.800
Are you through
with that?

32:23.900 --> 32:25.200
JOE:
What's going on?

32:25.234 --> 32:27.000
The camera. I want
to take it back.

32:27.200 --> 32:28.200
I'll get you
a different one,

32:28.200 --> 32:29.600
but I want
to take this one back.

32:30.000 --> 32:31.000
Why? I like it.

32:31.000 --> 32:33.700
Yeah, well, for what
it's worth, I like it, too.

32:33.700 --> 32:35.666
Is something the matter
with it, Mommy?

32:35.700 --> 32:36.666
Yeah,
I think so.

32:36.700 --> 32:38.100
The guy who sold it to me

32:38.134 --> 32:39.534
gave me a huge discount on it.

32:39.567 --> 32:41.500
Every night since
I gave it to you

32:41.500 --> 32:43.500
I watch you turn it off.
Then I come out here

32:43.500 --> 32:44.300
in the middle of the night,

32:44.300 --> 32:47.200
it's turned itself back on.
I'm worried it's going

32:47.200 --> 32:48.700
to catch fire
or something.
What?

32:49.700 --> 32:51.600
I'll get another one
a different one...

32:51.600 --> 32:52.700
I promise.

32:53.067 --> 32:54.700
Tomorrow. I promise.

33:04.833 --> 33:07.000
I don't want to hear a peep.
You're going back.

33:13.433 --> 33:14.633
Ah...

33:14.666 --> 33:16.600
You okay?

33:16.633 --> 33:17.633
Do you hear that?

33:19.000 --> 33:19.900
No.

33:19.933 --> 33:20.833
I don't
hear anything.

33:21.867 --> 33:23.067
Go back to sleep.

33:31.566 --> 33:33.234
Doesn't anyone hear that but me?

33:49.533 --> 33:50.533
Aw...

34:15.800 --> 34:16.733
TRAVIS:
It's open.

34:22.400 --> 34:23.967
Can you turn
that thing off, honey?

34:24.000 --> 34:27.132
TRAVIS:
No. I'd really rather not.

34:27.167 --> 34:28.366
The first time I saw you

34:28.399 --> 34:29.733
it was through this thing.

34:29.766 --> 34:32.067
I have a fond
memory of that.

34:32.100 --> 34:34.967
And I have a hunch we're gonna
be needing some memories.

34:35.000 --> 34:37.800
So I'll just keep pointing
this memory-maker at you

34:37.833 --> 34:39.733
if you don't mind.

34:39.766 --> 34:41.533
What are you talking about?

34:41.565 --> 34:43.867
We're together forever, baby.

34:43.900 --> 34:45.433
TRAVIS:
You think so?

34:45.466 --> 34:47.800
WeWe shot the wrong car.

34:47.833 --> 34:50.399
We shot the wrong person.

34:50.433 --> 34:52.067
You saw the news?

34:52.100 --> 34:53.600
How could I
miss the news?

34:53.632 --> 34:54.867
It's everywhere.

34:54.900 --> 34:57.466
We shot a
woman, Kathy.

34:57.499 --> 34:59.433
Some woman
driving home.

35:00.200 --> 35:02.700
Okay. So next time
we'll kill the right person.

35:02.700 --> 35:06.050
What? Next time?
Kathy, I don't know if I have
a "next time" in me.

35:06.050 --> 35:07.167
I mean, if we're
lucky enough

35:07.200 --> 35:08.800
to get away with this,
I don't know

35:08.833 --> 35:10.400
if I want to tempt fate
with a "next time."

35:10.933 --> 35:12.354
Well, what's the alternative?

35:13.354 --> 35:14.000
I don't know.

35:14.900 --> 35:16.000
I don't know what to do.

35:17.466 --> 35:18.566
We can't run
away together--

35:18.600 --> 35:19.566
you're still married.

35:19.600 --> 35:21.267
You're not gonna
get the money.

35:23.933 --> 35:24.967
You tell me.

35:25.000 --> 35:26.600
What do you
think we should do?

35:28.600 --> 35:31.000
Well, I don't think you should
sit there crying like a baby.

35:32.267 --> 35:33.300
Listen to yourself.

35:34.600 --> 35:37.233
You sound like you want
to commit suicide or something.

35:37.466 --> 35:38.466
Suicide?

35:57.499 --> 35:59.000
Seems to be
working fine.

35:59.499 --> 36:01.100
No... I'm sure it is.

36:01.100 --> 36:02.700
It's just, um...

36:03.000 --> 36:05.466
my boyfriend gave it to me
and... I'm just

36:05.700 --> 36:07.000
not a memory person, you know?

36:07.000 --> 36:08.700
I'm really about
the here and the now.

36:08.700 --> 36:10.000
So, here's the receipt.

36:13.234 --> 36:15.633
Any chance I can get cash?

36:21.267 --> 36:22.933
Sorry to wake you
at this hour

36:22.967 --> 36:24.766
but I thought
you'd want to know.

36:24.800 --> 36:26.000
You <i>were</i> partially right.

36:26.900 --> 36:28.100
Right about what?

36:28.600 --> 36:30.300
Guy's name <i>was</i> Travis.

36:30.900 --> 36:31.900
What are you talking about?

36:31.933 --> 36:33.466
Whose name was Travis?

36:34.933 --> 36:37.766
Travis McQueen, 24 years old.

36:37.800 --> 36:39.566
He was an Army sharpshooter.

36:39.600 --> 36:41.900
Mustered out of the service
five months ago.

36:41.933 --> 36:44.234
Couple of uniforms
responded to an odd smell

36:44.267 --> 36:45.900
coming from
an apartment downtown.

36:47.400 --> 36:49.700
Found a high-powered rifle
with a night scope.

36:50.400 --> 36:51.500
not to mention a dead body.

36:51.967 --> 36:53.900
Young guy. I'm guessing
he's been sitting here

36:53.933 --> 36:55.133
almost three days.

36:55.900 --> 36:57.300
Looks like a suicide.

36:59.400 --> 37:00.400
???????????

37:12.000 --> 37:15.500
Sorry. Uh, I'm not sure if this
is where I'm supposed to be.

37:15.500 --> 37:16.200
Diana.

37:16.867 --> 37:18.000
Diana Marvin.

37:19.066 --> 37:20.834
I have a strong feeling
this is exactly

37:20.867 --> 37:22.166
where you're supposed to be.

37:26.867 --> 37:27.700
Hi.

37:27.966 --> 37:29.000
Diana.

37:35.000 --> 37:36.200
Of course I know who he is.

37:36.200 --> 37:38.234
He's been a member
of the club I work at

37:38.267 --> 37:39.234
since I've been there.

37:39.267 --> 37:40.500
Not to mention
he's been

37:40.500 --> 37:42.000
all over the papers
and the news.

37:42.400 --> 37:46.500
I know you arrested him,
which is absurd.

37:47.334 --> 37:50.001
I feel so
terrible for him.

37:50.035 --> 37:51.701
You know, what
happened to his life.

37:51.734 --> 37:52.800
It's just...

37:54.500 --> 37:56.000
I know there's a
news blackout, but...

37:57.000 --> 37:58.500
are you folks any
closer to catching

37:58.534 --> 38:00.067
the person who's
actually responsible?

38:00.100 --> 38:01.733
We certainly think so.

38:02.766 --> 38:03.600
That's good.

38:04.400 --> 38:05.200
If you don't
mind my asking,

38:05.200 --> 38:07.100
just how well did you know him?

38:08.967 --> 38:10.500
We're getting awfully
personal here.

38:12.634 --> 38:14.601
I'm happy to help
with your investigation,

38:15.634 --> 38:17.800
You know, if Sean
needs a character witness,

38:17.800 --> 38:19.433
I'm only too happy
to help, but...

38:19.466 --> 38:20.699
Sean indicated

38:20.733 --> 38:23.466
that the two of you were
deeply involved for some months.

38:25.166 --> 38:27.533
Is... is that against the law?

38:29.400 --> 38:30.900
Is that why I'm here?

38:30.900 --> 38:32.232
Do you mind
if I ask...

38:32.266 --> 38:34.900
Who ended the affair?

38:35.600 --> 38:37.500
No one ended
anything.

38:39.033 --> 38:40.600
Sean Caffey is
a married man.

38:41.000 --> 38:44.000
The reality of the situation
became obvious to both of us.

38:44.000 --> 38:46.700
So you knew he wasn't about
to divorce his wife for you.

38:46.733 --> 38:48.000
He didn't offer.

38:48.500 --> 38:50.300
I certainly never asked.

38:51.500 --> 38:53.833
Do you mind if I ask
where you're going with this?

38:54.222 --> 38:55.100
Are you
aware

38:55.100 --> 38:58.100
That Mr. Caffey was bound
to a prenuptial agreement

38:58.100 --> 38:59.700
that for all
intents and purposes

38:59.733 --> 39:02.433
would leave him penniless if
his marriage ended in divorce?

39:03.000 --> 39:04.500
I don't understand
what you're saying.

39:04.867 --> 39:06.333
Penniless as a divorcée

39:06.366 --> 39:09.199
but extraordinarily wealthy
as a widower.

39:11.200 --> 39:12.200
Hmm.

39:13.533 --> 39:15.000
Well, it's...

39:16.199 --> 39:18.100
flattering to assume your lover

39:18.100 --> 39:19.566
might do anything
to be with you.

39:20.300 --> 39:21.267
That you could

39:21.300 --> 39:26.067
stir that kind of passion
in another person.

39:27.400 --> 39:28.666
Sean is many things,

39:28.700 --> 39:30.500
but he is <i>not</i> a murderer.

39:30.600 --> 39:31.867
Not even with help?

39:32.300 --> 39:34.100
No. Not Sean.

39:34.800 --> 39:35.900
Not ever.

39:37.900 --> 39:39.300
I believe you.

39:40.500 --> 39:41.667
Thank goodness.

39:42.400 --> 39:43.400
I do, too.

39:44.000 --> 39:46.567
I don't think he had
anything to do with it.

39:46.600 --> 39:47.799
I don't think
he knew anything

39:47.833 --> 39:49.700
about it.
I'm sure he didn't.

39:51.700 --> 39:54.033
Do you know a man
named Travis McQueen?

39:56.300 --> 39:57.433
Did you say "Travis"?

39:59.400 --> 40:00.500
I don't know anyone

40:00.533 --> 40:02.600
by the name of Travis, no.

40:04.200 --> 40:05.200
SCANLON:
He was a sharpshooter

40:05.200 --> 40:06.334
in the Army.

40:06.367 --> 40:07.968
Been out about six months now.

40:08.000 --> 40:09.300
He liked to hang
around in the park,

40:09.300 --> 40:11.734
take long-lens pictures
of pretty girls, chat them up,

40:11.767 --> 40:14.901
talk about his adventures
as a sniper in Iraq.

40:14.934 --> 40:16.300
No, I'm sorry.

40:16.334 --> 40:17.834
How about Kathy?

40:19.400 --> 40:21.901
Kathy... just Kathy?

40:21.934 --> 40:23.167
Do she have a last name?

40:23.200 --> 40:24.500
I'm sure she does.

40:25.734 --> 40:27.500
All I know is she
was Travis's girlfriend.

40:27.534 --> 40:28.000
or, 

40:29.000 --> 40:30.900
at least,
she pretended to be.

40:31.500 --> 40:32.600
No, sorry.

40:34.400 --> 40:36.367
Don't know a Travis,
don't know a Kathy.

40:36.400 --> 40:37.567
Hmm.

40:37.601 --> 40:40.367
And are you prepared
to swear to that?

40:40.400 --> 40:41.500
In a court of law?

40:41.534 --> 40:42.934
Excuse me?

40:47.068 --> 40:48.901
You have the right
to remain silent.

40:48.934 --> 40:50.267
Anything you say can and will

40:50.300 --> 40:52.400
be used against you
in a court of law.

40:52.434 --> 40:54.001
You have the right to counsel.

40:54.034 --> 40:55.400
Hold on.

40:55.434 --> 40:57.233
I just told you--

40:57.267 --> 40:58.334
whoever this person is,

40:58.367 --> 40:59.867
whoever his girlfriend is,

40:59.901 --> 41:02.200
however they were involved in
this thing, I don't know them.

41:02.200 --> 41:04.300
Why don't you
bring Allison's
friend in here?

41:04.700 --> 41:05.700
Yeah.

41:12.400 --> 41:13.200
This will just take a second.

41:22.001 --> 41:23.233
SCANLON:
This is the
lady, right?

41:23.267 --> 41:24.233
STORE CLERK:
Uh-huh.

41:24.267 --> 41:25.567
Hi, Kathy.

41:26.900 --> 41:28.400
SCANLON:
And you're prepared
to testify to that

41:28.400 --> 41:29.200
in a court of law?

41:29.400 --> 41:31.190
CLERK:
Uh-huh. Yeah, sure.

41:31.190 --> 41:32.366
That's her. Kathy.

41:32.500 --> 41:35.133
She came in and exchanged
a video camera for store credit.

41:35.900 --> 41:37.600
How's that flash screen
working out for you?

41:39.300 --> 41:41.300
And the proof of purchase
was this receipt,

41:41.300 --> 41:43.700
charged to the credit
card of Travis McQueen?

41:44.200 --> 41:45.000
That's the receipt.

41:49.233 --> 41:51.800
Hey. You want to hear
something funny?

41:52.633 --> 41:54.900
It may well be that the
camera you returned...

41:56.800 --> 41:58.200
...is the one I sold her.

41:58.366 --> 42:00.300
Hmm.
Huh.

42:00.350 --> 42:01.350
Go figure.
