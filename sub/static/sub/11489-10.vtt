Bonjour!

00:19.600 --> 00:21.690

00:27.500 --> 00:29.390

00:29.400 --> 00:32.090
Oh, nice to meet you.I'm Alan.

00:32.100 --> 00:35.790
Or as you would say "Elan".

00:35.800 --> 00:38.090
" Why would I say that?

00:38.100 --> 00:40.790
No reason.I'm a little dehydrated.

00:41.800 --> 00:43.890
So, you are a "see-klist.

00:43.900 --> 00:45.390
" A what?

00:45.400 --> 00:46.690

00:48.700 --> 00:53.590
" Oh, yes, yes-- I'm
very passionate about...

00:53.600 --> 00:56.690
bee-seek-ling.

00:56.700 --> 01:00.890
I even have a stationary "see-kel.

01:00.900 --> 01:02.690

01:12.900 --> 01:14.790
Au revoir.

01:15.200 --> 01:17.990
Au revoir.

01:21.100 --> 01:22.290
nice, huh?

01:22.300 --> 01:24.890
Nice?She's magnificent.

01:24.900 --> 01:26.490
You should see her naked.

01:26.500 --> 01:29.190
Can I?

01:29.700 --> 01:34.990
Well, I could show you some pictures, but
you may not want to see that much of me.

01:35.000 --> 01:38.790
Just out of curiosity, where
do you find women like that?

01:38.800 --> 01:42.690
And more importantly, how do you
get them to go to bed with you?

01:42.700 --> 01:44.090
You really want to know?

01:44.100 --> 01:46.490
Yeah, what's your secret?

01:46.500 --> 01:51.290
Well, you see, alan, it's like this.

01:53.700 --> 01:57.190
I got a knack.

01:57.800 --> 01:59.490
That's not a secret.

01:59.500 --> 02:02.090
I didn't think so, but you asked.

02:02.100 --> 02:03.990
So that's it?You've got a knack?

02:04.000 --> 02:06.290
Hey, everybody's good at something.

02:06.300 --> 02:08.590
You, for instance...

02:12.000 --> 02:14.790
have no shame.

02:14.800 --> 02:18.290
Excuse me, this is what they
wear in the tour de france.

02:18.300 --> 02:24.490
Alan, I just took a tour de france...

02:24.500 --> 02:28.890
and the only thing I was
wearing was a smile and a condom.

02:39.800 --> 02:40.890
hi, Judith.Hey, buddy.

02:40.900 --> 02:42.790
Hey.

02:42.800 --> 02:44.590
What's the matter with him?

02:44.600 --> 02:46.390
His little girlfriend broke up with him.

02:46.400 --> 02:47.890
Oh, no.

02:47.900 --> 02:49.490
Yeah, I was hoping
you could talk to him,

02:49.500 --> 02:53.590
'cause let's face it, who
knows more about getting dumped?

02:55.900 --> 02:58.190
You don't have to flatter
me, judith.I'll talk to him.

02:58.200 --> 02:59.990
I'm sorry, that didn't
come out the way I meant it.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.990
Really?How did you mean it?

03:02.000 --> 03:05.290
Oh, couldn't you just
take the "I'm sorry"?

03:05.300 --> 03:07.190
Couldn't you have just...

03:07.200 --> 03:09.990
loved me?

03:11.900 --> 03:13.590
Did I hear numbnuts come in?

03:13.600 --> 03:14.490
"Numbnuts"?

03:14.500 --> 03:17.590
Sorry, numbnuts junior.

03:17.600 --> 03:19.990
If you mean my son, yes, he's here.

03:20.000 --> 03:23.590
Aw, crap.

03:24.400 --> 03:25.290
What are you doing?

03:25.300 --> 03:27.790
Hiding my cookies.

03:27.800 --> 03:28.990
Why?

03:29.000 --> 03:32.990
Because I just bought a new bag and I
don't want that knucklehead to eat 'em all.

03:33.000 --> 03:36.290
Oh, charlie, you hide your cookies
from a little boy who loves you?

03:36.300 --> 03:38.090
Little boy, my ass.

03:38.100 --> 03:39.490
He's a bottomless pit,

03:39.500 --> 03:44.190
and I'm tired of going for a snack and
having to lick cookie dust out of the bag.

03:44.200 --> 03:45.690
You might want to take
it easy on him today.

03:45.700 --> 03:47.190
He's going through a bad breakup.

03:47.200 --> 03:50.690
- Aw, really?
- Yeah.

04:02.000 --> 04:04.590
Nope, my cookies.

04:10.300 --> 04:11.790
so, uh...

04:11.800 --> 04:13.090
how was school this week?

04:13.100 --> 04:14.990
Okay.

04:15.000 --> 04:17.490
Anything noteworthy happen?

04:17.500 --> 04:19.390
No.

04:19.399 --> 04:22.590
I thought you said he got dumped.

04:29.200 --> 04:31.290
I was easing into it.

04:31.300 --> 04:34.290
Oh, good idea.Go ahead.

04:34.800 --> 04:37.790
Jake, sooner or later,
every guy gets dumped.

04:37.800 --> 04:41.490
Some guys get dumped sooner
and later, right, alan?

04:42.600 --> 04:45.790
Sorry, I should've eased into that.

04:46.400 --> 04:49.290
My point is you've got nothing
to be embarrassed about.

04:49.300 --> 04:50.890
I'm not embarrassed.I'm angry.

04:50.900 --> 04:52.090
She didn't even tell me why.

04:52.100 --> 04:55.390
She just sent me an e-mail saying she
doesn't want to go out with me anymore.

04:55.400 --> 04:57.390
Maybe she found somebody better.

04:57.400 --> 05:00.990
What do you mean
better?Who's better than jake?

05:02.800 --> 05:05.790
Why, no one, alan.

05:06.200 --> 05:08.990
He's the pinnacle of male evolution.

05:09.800 --> 05:12.290
Thank you.

05:13.400 --> 05:15.290
Look, buddy, I know
exactly how you feel.

05:15.300 --> 05:19.490
When I was your age, I was dating a
beautiful girl-- charity kirschenbaum.

05:19.500 --> 05:21.390
I was crazy about her.

05:21.400 --> 05:24.790
Then, the night before junior
prom, she called and dumped me.

05:24.800 --> 05:27.590
Wouldn't even give me a
reason.I was devastated.

05:27.600 --> 05:28.890
So what'd you do?

05:28.900 --> 05:30.090
What could I do?

05:30.100 --> 05:31.890
How can you mend a broken heart?

05:31.900 --> 05:35.690
How can you stop the
rain from falling down?

05:39.700 --> 05:40.890
You done?

05:40.900 --> 05:44.090
Unless you want to hear "jive talkin'.

05:47.400 --> 05:50.990
" The thing is, jake, that no
matter how bad you feel now,

05:51.000 --> 05:52.390
eventually, it'll pass.

05:52.400 --> 05:55.090
You just have to be willing
to live with the pain.

05:55.100 --> 05:56.790
- No, he doesn'T.
- Yes, he does.

05:56.800 --> 05:59.890
Hang on, dad.What do
you mean, no, I don't?

05:59.900 --> 06:02.690
When you get dumped, you don't sit
around feeling sorry for yourself.

06:02.700 --> 06:06.290
You go out and find
another girl.A better girl.

06:06.300 --> 06:08.290
Okay, but how am I
gonna get another girl?

06:08.300 --> 06:10.590
I don't know how I got this one.

06:10.600 --> 06:12.390
You don't know how you got a girlfriend?

06:12.400 --> 06:14.290
No.It just kind of happened.

06:14.300 --> 06:17.090
Yeah, I know how that goes.

06:17.100 --> 06:21.790
You wake up in the morning and there
she is.Shut up.I know that was wrong.

06:22.400 --> 06:25.690
Look, jake, who is the
cutest girl in your class?

06:25.700 --> 06:26.890
Nicole o'malley.

06:26.900 --> 06:29.390
Okay, call Nicole
o'malley and ask her out.

06:29.400 --> 06:31.390
Are you drunk?

06:31.400 --> 06:35.090
A little.

06:35.100 --> 06:36.190
but...

06:36.200 --> 06:40.290
this is a secret that will serve
you for the rest of your life.

06:40.300 --> 06:44.990
The hotter the girl, the lonelier she is,because
most guys are too scared to talk to her.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.090
- Really?!
- Really?!

06:47.100 --> 06:50.190
Trust me.

06:52.200 --> 06:54.390
Why couldn't you have
said this 20 years ago?

06:54.400 --> 06:57.790
Come on, dad, I wasn't
even born 20 years ago.

06:57.800 --> 07:03.190
I really shouldn't be giving him advice
that could help him reproduce, should I?

07:17.000 --> 07:19.790
oh, it's just you.

07:19.800 --> 07:22.090
Hey.

07:23.500 --> 07:25.190
What are you doing?

07:25.200 --> 07:31.690
I'm drinking some of your finest scotch
and looking at my high school yearbook.

07:31.700 --> 07:34.090
Charity kirschenbaum.

07:34.100 --> 07:39.790
I can't help wondering how my life
would've turned out if she hadn't dumped me.

07:39.800 --> 07:42.390
Come on, your life turned out great.

07:44.700 --> 07:47.190
Well, it wouldn't have
turned out any better.

07:47.200 --> 07:49.090
You know what?

07:49.100 --> 07:53.490
I'm gonna call her and find
out why she broke my heart.

07:53.500 --> 07:54.690
Good thinking.

07:54.700 --> 07:57.690
Call your high school girlfriend
drunk at 2:00 in the morning.

07:57.700 --> 08:02.190
While you're at it, why don't you expose
yourself to an undercover policewoman?

08:02.200 --> 08:04.790
Some people do that.

08:04.800 --> 08:06.690
I need closure.

08:06.700 --> 08:10.490
I need to understand why she dumped me.

08:10.500 --> 08:12.990
What's to understand?

08:14.500 --> 08:18.190
This is her?

08:18.200 --> 08:20.790
This is you.

08:21.100 --> 08:23.590
Peaches and cream complexion.

08:24.200 --> 08:26.690
You.

08:27.300 --> 08:29.190
Cheerleader.

08:29.200 --> 08:31.490
You.

08:32.100 --> 08:34.190
Stop me anytime.

08:34.200 --> 08:35.390
I don't care.

08:35.400 --> 08:38.090
I got number off the
internet and I'm calling her.

08:38.100 --> 08:39.490
Oh, man.

08:39.500 --> 08:42.789
Enwh're they gonna invent a
phone with a breathalyzer lock?

08:42.799 --> 08:45.190
Shh, it's ringing.

08:45.500 --> 08:47.190
Hello?

08:47.200 --> 08:49.990
Hello, is this charity?

08:50.600 --> 08:51.690
Hi, charity.

08:51.700 --> 08:53.890
This is alan harper.

08:53.900 --> 08:56.590
Yeah, yeah, from high school.

08:56.600 --> 08:59.190
Anyway...

08:59.500 --> 09:01.890
yeah, I know it's late.

09:01.900 --> 09:04.190
Yeah, I know I'm drunk.

09:04.200 --> 09:06.690
Listen, I just need to
ask you one question.

09:08.000 --> 09:12.190
Why did you dump me on the
night before the junior prom?

09:15.800 --> 09:17.790
Okay, okay.

09:17.800 --> 09:18.990
Okay, thanks.

09:19.000 --> 09:21.390
Go back to sleep.

09:22.400 --> 09:31.390
She said to ask my brother Char...arlie.

09:42.400 --> 09:45.390
oh, that's why.

09:53.200 --> 09:54.390
Morning.

09:54.400 --> 09:56.790
Morning.

09:59.800 --> 10:01.790
You found the stash, huh?

10:01.800 --> 10:03.290
Wasn't well hidden.

10:03.300 --> 10:05.690
Okay, just for the record,
that stuff's medicinal.

10:05.700 --> 10:08.690
I've got glaucoma.

10:08.700 --> 10:10.290
What are you talking about?

10:10.300 --> 10:12.690
Nothing.

10:15.800 --> 10:16.990
Morning.

10:17.000 --> 10:18.290
Morning.

10:18.300 --> 10:20.590
So where'd you disappear to last night?

10:20.600 --> 10:22.590
Me?I decided to take a little drive,

10:22.600 --> 10:26.590
give you a chance to calm down
about charity kirschenbaum.

10:26.600 --> 10:27.890
I'm perfectly calm.

10:27.900 --> 10:28.590
Good.

10:28.600 --> 10:31.090
Who's charity kirschenbaum?

10:31.100 --> 10:34.890
It's just a little thing that's
not worth getting upset about and...

10:34.900 --> 10:38.090
hey!What the hell are you
doing with my cookies?!

10:38.100 --> 10:38.890
They're yours?

10:38.900 --> 10:40.590
You know they're mine.

10:40.600 --> 10:46.290
So you're saying I took something
that belonged to you and you're upset?

10:50.800 --> 10:52.990
Oh, come on, alan.

10:53.000 --> 10:56.090
I loved charity kirschenbaum and you
stole her right out from under me!

10:56.100 --> 10:59.490
He's speaking metaphorically, right?

10:59.900 --> 11:02.290
Yeah, he was never on top of that.

11:03.600 --> 11:05.390
I would've been, if it weren't for you.

11:05.400 --> 11:08.890
Okay fine, I took
your girl 20 years ago.

11:08.900 --> 11:11.590
That calls for maybe
five, six cookies, tops.

11:11.600 --> 11:13.590
Not the whole damn bag.

11:13.600 --> 11:16.290
I had to go to junior
prom with cousin phoebe!

11:16.300 --> 11:17.490
She was cute.

11:17.500 --> 11:19.790
She was 12 and in a body cast!

11:19.800 --> 11:21.990
So what?She was your cousin.

11:22.000 --> 11:27.090
She could have been 18 and in a cellophane
bikini, and you weren't gonna get any.

11:27.100 --> 11:32.190
You are a horrible human being
and I hope you burn in hell!

11:32.200 --> 11:33.390
So we're good?

11:33.400 --> 11:34.490
No!

11:34.500 --> 11:36.690
We are not good!

11:36.700 --> 11:40.790
We suck!

11:40.800 --> 11:43.390
- freshen that up for you?
- Thanks.

11:43.400 --> 11:47.590
You betrayed me!

11:47.600 --> 11:51.490
I hate you!

11:51.500 --> 11:58.790
I hate you, I hate you, I hate you!!

11:59.700 --> 12:03.390
Sounds like he's going for a bike ride.

12:05.600 --> 12:07.990
Hello, nicole o'malley?

12:08.000 --> 12:09.590
Jake harper here.

12:09.600 --> 12:11.190
Harper.

12:11.200 --> 12:13.690
I sit next to you in geometry class.

12:13.700 --> 12:15.690
No, the other side.

12:15.700 --> 12:18.890
Yeah, with the big head.

12:19.200 --> 12:22.790
I was wondering if you would
go to the winter dance with me.

12:22.800 --> 12:24.190
Really?

12:24.200 --> 12:26.290
Are you sure?

12:26.300 --> 12:27.790
Well, great.

12:27.800 --> 12:31.290
I guess I'll see you in school.Bye.

12:31.300 --> 12:32.690
Uncle charlie's a genius.

12:32.700 --> 12:35.290
In a sense.

12:35.300 --> 12:39.490
But there's book smart and nook smart.

12:41.900 --> 12:43.190
Would you get that, berta?!

12:43.200 --> 12:44.390
What?!

12:44.400 --> 12:45.790
The door!

12:45.800 --> 12:47.790
I can't hear you!

12:47.800 --> 12:49.490
I said, would you get the door?

12:49.500 --> 12:52.890
I can't!I'm upstairs!

12:57.400 --> 12:59.790
Hi, judith.Jake, your mom's here!

12:59.800 --> 13:00.690
Did you talk to him?

13:00.700 --> 13:01.890
I did.

13:01.900 --> 13:02.990
Hey, mom.

13:03.000 --> 13:04.190
Hey, honey, how's it going?

13:04.200 --> 13:06.590
Great.Uncle charlie's a genius.

13:06.600 --> 13:08.490
Good, good.

13:08.500 --> 13:09.790
You said you talked to him.

13:09.800 --> 13:10.590
I did.

13:10.600 --> 13:12.190
Then why is uncle charlie a genius?

13:12.200 --> 13:15.190
'Cause he never got married.

13:17.900 --> 13:21.590
Oh, that's gonna come
back to bite me in the ass.

13:23.600 --> 13:26.790
and here it comes, jaws a-snappin'.

13:28.200 --> 13:30.790
All right, I'm sorry!

13:32.100 --> 13:34.590
Why are you sorry?

13:34.600 --> 13:37.990
I just find it's easier that way.

13:38.000 --> 13:40.390
Okay.Is charlie at home?

13:40.400 --> 13:43.590
Oh, no, he, uh, he went
out a couple of hours ago.

13:43.600 --> 13:46.690
I've been trying to call him on
his cell but he doesn't answer.

13:46.700 --> 13:48.490
Well, please tell him I stopped by.

13:48.500 --> 13:50.990
Sure, sure thing.

13:51.000 --> 13:52.890
Gabrielle?

13:52.900 --> 13:54.190
Oui?

13:54.800 --> 13:57.290
forgive me if I'm out of line, but...

13:57.300 --> 13:58.690
I...

13:58.700 --> 14:00.290
sense A...

14:00.300 --> 14:03.690
loneliness inside you.

14:03.700 --> 14:05.590
Is it so obvious?

14:05.600 --> 14:07.390
I'm right?

14:07.400 --> 14:11.190
Oh, yes, but how could you know?

14:11.200 --> 14:13.090
We're two of a kind.

14:13.100 --> 14:19.390
I myself have tasted the
saltiness of lonely tears.

14:19.400 --> 14:20.890
Oh, pauvre petit.

14:20.900 --> 14:22.390
We have much to share.

14:22.400 --> 14:25.390
We do indeed.Come on in.

14:26.100 --> 14:29.390
First his cookies, now his croissant.

14:32.200 --> 14:34.290
Well, in my experience,

14:34.300 --> 14:38.890
I've found that the more beautiful
the woman is, the lonelier she is.

14:38.900 --> 14:40.490
Oh, that's very true.

14:40.500 --> 14:42.690
How do you know so much about women?

14:42.700 --> 14:44.090
What can I say?

14:44.100 --> 14:47.290
I have a knack.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.190
Hey.

14:49.200 --> 14:51.390
Oh, hello, charlie.

14:51.400 --> 14:53.890
Gee, how embarrassing.

14:53.900 --> 14:54.990
What are you talking about?

14:55.000 --> 14:57.490
Oh, dear.This is so difficult.

14:57.500 --> 15:00.390
No, it's not.Go
ahead.Tell him, tell him.

15:00.400 --> 15:03.190
Charlie, you are wonderful man,

15:03.200 --> 15:07.290
but your brother, he
really understands me.

15:07.300 --> 15:10.190
So, what are you saying?

15:10.200 --> 15:12.290
It's just...

15:12.300 --> 15:14.590
I...

15:14.600 --> 15:15.590
I can'T.

15:15.600 --> 15:18.690
I can-- she's dumping
you for me.Ha-ha.

15:18.700 --> 15:22.690
This is so awkward.I must go.Please...

15:22.700 --> 15:25.490
forgive me.

15:29.000 --> 15:30.390
Huh, huh?

15:30.400 --> 15:32.290
How does it feel?

15:32.300 --> 15:33.390
I'm stunned.

15:33.400 --> 15:35.090
Good, good.What else?

15:35.100 --> 15:36.290
You snaked my girlfriend?

15:36.300 --> 15:39.590
Yes I did.I snaked her.Like a cobra.

15:41.500 --> 15:43.090
And you did it just to hurt me?

15:43.100 --> 15:45.490
Well, not just to hurt you.

15:45.500 --> 15:48.590
Well, yeah--
just to hurt you.

15:48.600 --> 15:50.790
I don't know what to say.

15:50.800 --> 15:53.090
- I'm crushed.
- That's good.Say that.

15:53.100 --> 15:55.790
"I'm crushed.

15:56.200 --> 16:00.790
" My own brother purposefully
set out to hurt me.

16:00.800 --> 16:01.990
Oh, no.Oh, no.

16:02.000 --> 16:03.490
You're not taking this away from me.

16:03.500 --> 16:05.890
What about you and charity kirschenbaum?

16:05.900 --> 16:08.690
I was 17, alan.I was a horny idiot.

16:08.700 --> 16:11.190
But you, you're an adult.

16:11.200 --> 16:14.090
Okay, I see where you're
going, and it's not gonna work.

16:14.100 --> 16:16.290
You're not taking this away form me.

16:16.300 --> 16:20.590
I really thought our relationship
had grown beyond this petty crap.

16:20.600 --> 16:22.690
I thought I could count on you.

16:22.700 --> 16:25.990
I thoughf you were my friend.

16:29.200 --> 16:32.790
Son of a bitch, he took it away from me.

16:44.200 --> 16:46.490
Oh, hey, you're here.

16:46.500 --> 16:49.390
Where am I gonna go, alan?

16:50.200 --> 16:51.890
You took my girl.

16:51.900 --> 16:54.990
And-and I feel awful about that.

16:55.000 --> 16:56.390
It doesn't matter.

16:56.400 --> 16:58.790
It does matter.I made
a terrible mistake.

16:58.800 --> 17:02.090
I did the worst thing
I could possibly do.

17:02.100 --> 17:04.890
I lowered myself to your level.

17:06.200 --> 17:07.390
You know what I mean.

17:07.400 --> 17:08.890
I-I-I love
you.You're my brother.

17:08.900 --> 17:10.390
I-I wouldn't hurt you for the world.

17:10.400 --> 17:12.190
Actions speak louder than words, alan.

17:12.200 --> 17:13.990
You're right.Okay.

17:14.000 --> 17:15.790
Here's an action.

17:15.800 --> 17:18.089
Ta-dah!

17:19.400 --> 17:21.690
You bought me a bag of cookies.

17:21.700 --> 17:24.890
Sure, that should make
up for stealing gabrielle.

17:26.800 --> 17:30.290
How about three bags?

17:30.300 --> 17:33.290
And I'm breaking it off with
her.You can have her back.

17:33.300 --> 17:35.190
Have her back?

17:35.200 --> 17:36.090
What is wrong with you?

17:36.100 --> 17:39.290
She's not a lawnmower you borrowed.

17:39.300 --> 17:43.890
You can't just hose off the
blades and give her back.

17:43.900 --> 17:44.990
But...but I-I...

17:45.000 --> 17:46.890
but nothing.

17:46.900 --> 17:49.190
She dumped me because
she likes you better.

17:49.200 --> 17:50.690
So, what are you going
to say to her, alan?

17:50.700 --> 17:54.690
"I was just using you to punish charlie for
something that happened when we were kids?

17:55.100 --> 17:57.990
" I probably wouldn't use those words.

17:58.000 --> 18:02.290
You can't ease your conscience
about hurting me by hurting her.

18:02.300 --> 18:05.090
So, you're saying you
want me to keep seeing her?

18:05.100 --> 18:08.190
I'm saying I want you
to do the right thing.

18:08.200 --> 18:09.390
Then you'll forgive me?

18:09.400 --> 18:10.490
Yes.

18:10.500 --> 18:13.490
Then I'll forgive you.

18:13.500 --> 18:14.690
Well...

18:14.700 --> 18:16.990
okay.

18:17.000 --> 18:18.490
For you...

18:18.500 --> 18:22.990
I'll keep seeing the gorgeous woman.

18:23.000 --> 18:24.990
Thank you.

18:25.000 --> 18:27.290
You're welcome.

18:29.100 --> 18:31.690
Yay.

18:31.700 --> 18:33.790
Okay, so what's the catch?

18:33.800 --> 18:35.690
Catch?

18:35.700 --> 18:38.990
I don't know what you're talking about.

18:41.100 --> 18:44.590
So, are you sure everything's
okay with charlie?

18:44.600 --> 18:46.290
Oh, everything's great with
charlie; charlie's fine.

18:46.300 --> 18:50.290
Forget charlie.Come
couchez avec moi ce soir.

18:50.300 --> 18:51.490
Pardon?

18:51.500 --> 18:56.390
You know, like the song,
"voulez-vouz coucher avec moi ce...

18:56.400 --> 18:59.090
" sacre bleu.

19:06.400 --> 19:08.490
Okay.

19:09.100 --> 19:11.790
I'm ready.

19:12.800 --> 19:13.890
Excuse me?

19:13.900 --> 19:15.190
Go ahead.

19:15.200 --> 19:18.090
Get it over with.

19:18.100 --> 19:19.690
I'm, I'm not sure I follow.

19:19.700 --> 19:21.290
Do what you have to do.

19:21.300 --> 19:22.490
Just...

19:22.500 --> 19:24.590
hurry.

19:24.600 --> 19:25.790
But...

19:25.800 --> 19:30.390
don't you want to start with some
kissing and, you know, foreplay?

19:30.400 --> 19:33.590
No.Thank you.

19:33.600 --> 19:36.890
How about a smile?

19:40.400 --> 19:42.390
Better?

19:42.400 --> 19:45.190
Actually, worse.

19:45.200 --> 19:46.690
Could you...

19:46.700 --> 19:49.990
close your eyes again?

20:00.500 --> 20:01.890
Where are you going?

20:01.900 --> 20:03.490
Uh, I have to brush my teeth.

20:03.500 --> 20:04.790
The bathroom's that way.

20:04.800 --> 20:08.290
Yeah, but my toothbrush
is at home.Bye-bye.

20:16.700 --> 20:18.890
- hey.
- Hey.

20:19.500 --> 20:21.990
How'd it go with gabrielle?

20:22.000 --> 20:23.890
I think you know how it went.

20:23.900 --> 20:26.990
Yeah, I do.

20:27.000 --> 20:29.590
It's kinda like necrophilia, isn't it?

20:29.600 --> 20:30.990
I didn't go through with it.

20:31.000 --> 20:32.690
Really?

20:32.700 --> 20:36.290
Guess we're different that way.

20:36.700 --> 20:38.490
So...

20:38.500 --> 20:41.790
I didn't really steal
her from you, did I?

20:41.800 --> 20:43.290
Nope.

20:43.300 --> 20:45.090
You were trying to get rid of
her the whole time, weren't you?

20:45.100 --> 20:46.390
Yep.

20:46.400 --> 20:48.090
But I didn't want to hurt her feelings.

20:48.100 --> 20:51.190
Thanks for helping me out with that.

20:51.200 --> 20:55.990
Well, at least now we're even, right?

20:56.000 --> 20:57.190
Not quite.

20:57.200 --> 20:58.290
What do you mean?

20:58.300 --> 21:01.690
Charlie.Are you coming back to bed?

21:01.700 --> 21:04.990
Charity?Charity kirschenbaum?

21:05.000 --> 21:06.790
Oh, hi, Alan.Long time no see.

21:06.800 --> 21:09.390
Yeah.20 years.

21:09.400 --> 21:11.890
She looks great, doesn't she?

21:11.900 --> 21:12.690
Come on, baby.

21:12.700 --> 21:14.190
But, but, but...

21:14.200 --> 21:18.390
now we're even.

21:22.800 --> 21:27.690
I...hate...you!
