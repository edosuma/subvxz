<i>He's had the same job for nearly 40 years.</i>

<i>Dr. Fauci, how concerned should we be?</i>

-COURTNEY BILLET: <i>Correct.</i>
-Unbelievable.

COURTNEY:<i> I asked specifically</i>
<i>"Who said 'no'?"</i>

04:14.379 --> 04:18.508
<i>and it was the White House.</i>
<i>So, I guess we're back at our stalemate.</i>

<i>And, you know, I didn't know</i>
<i>when I pushed back on it,</i>

04:23.096 --> 04:27.350
<i>the answer I got was that they want</i>
<i>the focus to be on the economy.</i>

04:27.767 --> 04:33.231
I don't get how talking about vaccine
isn't important about the economy.

04:33.439 --> 04:35.775
If you get a vaccine,
the economy will open.

04:35.858 --> 04:36.985

<i>I mean, this guy, if I listen to him...</i>

<i>a lot of people think I'm the bad guy.</i>

<i>on television there's always a bomb.</i>

05:03.261 --> 05:07.473
<i>If we listen to him, we have 700,</i>
<i>800,000 deaths right now.</i>

05:07.598 --> 05:11.060

<i>you can have it just the way it's done.</i>

<i>to an entire subset of people...</i>

I'm so good at my job.
How can he be so bad at his?

05:50.767 --> 05:52.727
So the protests don't increase
the spread of the virus?

05:52.810 --> 05:54.896
I didn't say that.
You're putting words in my mouth.

05:55.063 --> 06:01.527
Is somebody born a craven partisan hack
or do you become one?

06:02.528 --> 06:06.532
DR. FAUCI: <i>I grew up in Bensonhurst,</i>
<i>which was a somewhat tough neighborhood</i>

06:06.616 --> 06:09.702
<i>in Brooklyn. You know,</i>
<i>everyone was striving.</i>

06:09.994 --> 06:11.746
<i>Nothing was taken for granted.</i>

06:12.830 --> 06:16.250
There wasn't a lot of head hanging
in those days, you know?

06:18.002 --> 06:20.922
<i>Part of the culture back then</i>
<i>when you were a kid</i>

06:21.464 --> 06:24.217
is that you didn't get intimidated
by a lot of things.

06:24.342 --> 06:27.011
Or, as we used to say,
"You didn't take any shit from anybody."

06:27.261 --> 06:28.388
TRUMP: <i>I don't want to hurt him.</i>

06:28.471 --> 06:31.682
He's been there for about 350 years.
I don't want to hurt him.

06:32.058 --> 06:34.268

<i>Anthony Fauci, this fraud?</i>

06:34.769 --> 06:37.730

<i>to go on his power walks</i>

<i>with a security detail,</i>
<i>because he's received death threats.</i>

06:44.737 --> 06:50.326
DR. FAUCI: <i>My job is to do whatever I can</i>
<i>to get us out of this outbreak.</i>

06:53.413 --> 06:58.918
My weapon, in addition to the science,
is speaking to the American public.

07:02.296 --> 07:07.552
<i>What keeps me grounded</i>
<i>is the enormity of the problem.</i>

07:09.178 --> 07:13.141
<i>And just a very deep sense</i>
<i>of responsibility...</i>

07:14.350 --> 07:20.690
that calls for all of the things
that I've been trained for,

07:20.857 --> 07:22.692
dating back to when I was going to school.

07:27.029 --> 07:32.577
<i>In high school, I had</i>
<i>this early cultivation of public service.</i>

07:34.579 --> 07:39.333
Regis High School was driven by these guys

07:39.417 --> 07:42.044
in black cassocks called Jesuit Priests.

07:43.379 --> 07:46.215
<i>The Jesuit philosophy is men for others.</i>

07:47.383 --> 07:50.303
<i>You think about what you can do</i>
<i>for society</i>

07:50.386 --> 07:51.971
<i>and what you can do for other people.</i>

07:53.055 --> 07:55.558
It's what drove me to go
to medical school.

07:59.687 --> 08:04.567
<i>There wasn't a minute that I really</i>
<i>didn't treasure at Cornell Medical School.</i>

08:05.735 --> 08:08.237
<i>I loved clinical medicine.</i>

08:09.030 --> 08:12.533
<i>Every single cell in my body was,</i>
<i>like, focused in this.</i>

08:12.617 --> 08:17.121
<i>It was the first time in my life</i>
<i>that somebody's life is my responsibility.</i>

08:20.416 --> 08:24.670
<i>At the end of my junior year,</i>
<i>it was the Vietnam War.</i>

08:28.216 --> 08:32.053
<i>And every physician</i>
<i>is automatically drafted.</i>

08:33.387 --> 08:37.892
<i>But you had some choices.</i>
<i>You could do public health service,</i>

08:38.351 --> 08:40.394
<i>Navy, Army or Air Force.</i>

08:42.063 --> 08:45.149
So, I put in public health service first.

08:45.483 --> 08:49.362
Second I put Navy, then Army,
and then Air Force.

08:50.321 --> 08:53.950
<i>And, sure enough, I get a call</i>
<i>from the National Institutes of Health.</i>

08:55.368 --> 09:00.790
<i>The NIH was and is really</i>
<i>the mecca of biomedical research.</i>

09:01.749 --> 09:05.419
MALE REPORTER: <i>Here in the laboratories</i>
<i>at NIH, much of the research is basic.</i>

09:06.337 --> 09:10.132
<i>Clinical medicine is practiced at NIH</i>
<i>because it contributes to research</i>

09:10.633 --> 09:13.511
<i>rather than because of the patient's need</i>
<i>for medical attention.</i>

09:14.595 --> 09:16.180
DR. FAUCI:<i> Virtually everyone</i>

09:16.514 --> 09:19.559
<i>who was anyone in academic medicine</i>
<i>in this country...</i>

09:19.934 --> 09:22.603
<i>had spent some time here.</i>

09:23.271 --> 09:27.567
And it was like entering
into a magical world.

09:30.027 --> 09:31.696
<i>When I first came down,</i>

09:31.779 --> 09:33.823
<i>what I really wanted to do</i>
<i>was do three years,</i>

09:33.906 --> 09:35.199
<i>bingo, and go back to New York</i>

09:35.366 --> 09:38.661
<i>and become the Chief Resident</i>
<i>at the New York Hospital.</i>

09:39.579 --> 09:45.668
Back then, that was your ticket
to a private practice on Park Avenue.

09:47.003 --> 09:49.422
<i>You know, I was a kid from Brooklyn</i>

09:49.964 --> 09:56.679
and Brooklyn to Manhattan
is like New York State to Rome. (LAUGHS)

09:58.222 --> 10:02.184
But as I got to learn more about myself,
the idea of discovery,

10:02.310 --> 10:05.229
the idea of having an impact
on a lot more people...

10:06.022 --> 10:09.609
<i>trying to figure out diseases</i>
<i>that people were dying from,</i>

10:09.692 --> 10:12.320
that's what really captured me.

10:13.904 --> 10:18.075
<i>So, I became the Senior Investigator</i>
<i>at the NIH.</i>

10:22.747 --> 10:26.375
I met Tony very shortly after I came
to the NIH.

10:29.545 --> 10:33.049
<i>Tony was a Lab Chief at that point</i>
<i>in time.</i>

10:34.300 --> 10:38.971
He was a long-term single guy.
Totally dedicated to work.

10:39.263 --> 10:42.350
He worked more hours
than almost anybody I've ever known.

10:43.434 --> 10:46.020
<i>My wife and I would sometimes tease Tony.</i>

10:46.103 --> 10:49.649
<i>because he had several female companions</i>
<i>through the years.</i>

10:52.193 --> 10:53.986
DR. FAUCI:<i> I'd go on a date every once</i>
<i>in a while,</i>

10:54.111 --> 10:58.282
<i>but I was completely buried in my work.</i>

10:59.784 --> 11:02.328
CHRISTINE GRADY:
<i>I actually remember very vividly,</i>

11:02.411 --> 11:04.455
<i>and hearing this</i>
<i>from other people as well,</i>

11:04.538 --> 11:07.416
if you're working
with one of Tony Fauci's patients,

11:07.500 --> 11:09.460
you'd better take good care
of that patient

11:09.543 --> 11:11.962
because he will demand it of you.

11:13.047 --> 11:17.051
All of this discussion of vasculitis
is merely academic.

11:17.176 --> 11:18.260
DR. FAUCI: <i>At the time,</i>

11:18.386 --> 11:23.474
I was focused on vasculitis
which is an inflammation of blood vessels

11:23.557 --> 11:26.686
that leads to kidney failure,
lung failure and things like that.

11:27.520 --> 11:31.232
<i>There was a patient who was a senator</i>
<i>from Brazil.</i>

11:31.357 --> 11:33.734
<i>He didn't speak any English and I said,</i>

11:33.818 --> 11:35.778
<i>"Well, I can't have a conversation</i>
<i>with this guy,</i>

11:35.861 --> 11:37.571
<i>so who speaks Portuguese around here?"</i>

11:38.489 --> 11:42.451
So they called this nurse,
this Christine Grady,

11:42.618 --> 11:44.620
into the room, um...

11:45.496 --> 11:48.582
and she stand by the bedside
and I looked at her, I says, "Wow!"

11:48.666 --> 11:51.794
(LAUGHS) "Who's this?"

11:54.213 --> 11:56.298
CHRISTINE:<i> I had just spent two years</i>
<i>in Brazil</i>

11:56.590 --> 11:58.426
and so my Portuguese
was then pretty good.

11:59.176 --> 12:01.095
<i>And we had this meeting</i>
<i>in the patient's room</i>

12:01.220 --> 12:04.181
and I said, "He would like to go home."

12:04.640 --> 12:07.101
I said, "Okay. That's fine to do that,

12:07.476 --> 12:11.605
"but he's gotta understand,
these ulcers are not completely healed.

12:11.814 --> 12:14.191
"He's gotta keep his legs elevated

12:14.483 --> 12:17.069
and he's gotta change
the dressings frequently."

12:17.695 --> 12:20.406
So, he speaks Portuguese back.
(MUMBLES)

12:20.489 --> 12:22.408
I'm, sort of, sitting there
waiting to hear.

12:22.658 --> 12:26.787
The patient said to me... (SCOFFS)
"There's no way I'm going to do that.

12:27.371 --> 12:32.168
I'm going to go to the beach every day."
He lived on the beach, near the beach.

12:32.334 --> 12:36.046
"And I'm going to go dancing at night.
I've been in the hospital for months

12:36.213 --> 12:38.758
and you expect me to go home
and sit with my leg in the air?"

12:39.049 --> 12:43.429
And I, sort of, gulped and thought,
what the heck am I going to do now?

12:43.512 --> 12:45.431
She turned to me and looked at me

12:45.556 --> 12:49.226
and said, "He said he's gonna do exactly
like you said."

12:49.769 --> 12:51.353
I said, "Good. You can go."

12:54.899 --> 12:58.903
CHRISTINE: <i>A day later,</i>
<i>I saw Dr. Fauci in the hallway,</i>

12:59.153 --> 13:01.655
who said to me,
"I'd like to see you in my office."

13:02.198 --> 13:06.535
And I was certain that I was caught

13:06.619 --> 13:10.372
and going to be either reprimanded
or fired.

13:11.123 --> 13:14.293
So, she comes into the office
with a great deal of trepidation.

13:14.502 --> 13:18.172
She sits down and I look at her and I say,

and found it.

DR. FAUCI:<i> I was sitting in my office</i>
<i>and I saw this... article...</i>

14:10.516 --> 14:14.645
<i>in a publication called </i>MMWR.

14:14.895 --> 14:21.360

<i>And it reported five men...</i>

14:21.819 --> 14:28.325
curiously all gay men, who developed
a very strange pneumonia

14:28.701 --> 14:30.578
called pneumocystis pneumonia.

14:30.828 --> 14:34.790
And, being a busy young investigator
at the time,

14:35.082 --> 14:39.295
I took it, I put it in my desk
and I said, "This must be a fluke.

14:39.420 --> 14:40.713
It's gonna go away."

14:42.423 --> 14:47.261
<i>One month later, another </i>MMWR <i>appears.</i>

14:48.012 --> 14:52.349
<i>This time, 26 gay men...</i>

14:53.017 --> 14:56.437
who not only had pneumocystis pneumonia,

14:56.979 --> 15:01.817
but had Kaposi's sarcoma,
a tumor, a cancer,

15:02.610 --> 15:06.947
seen in people whose immune system
is remarkably suppressed.

15:07.239 --> 15:12.453

and going, "Oh, my God.

15:12.995 --> 15:16.123
"There's no way that this is a fluke.

15:16.999 --> 15:19.335

15:21.462 --> 15:22.922
<i>I actually got goosebumps.</i>

15:24.590 --> 15:28.636
So, I made a decision
that I was going to completely change

15:28.761 --> 15:30.179

his career basically.

15:49.281 --> 15:52.576
DR. FAUCI: <i>So, I wrote an article</i>
<i>in 1981...</i>

<i>that it's not gonna explode,</i>

16:06.507 --> 16:08.384

16:09.093 --> 16:12.262
They rejected it
because one of the reviewers said

16:12.346 --> 16:14.014
I was being too alarmist.

16:15.432 --> 16:19.269
CHRISTINE:<i> So right away, he had</i>

that's an mRNA vaccine.

<i>This is different from other vaccines.</i>

<i>But never before have we seen</i>

30:57.856 --> 30:59.983
When we were confronted with this virus,

31:00.316 --> 31:04.153
there are a lot of very smart people
at the NIH who put their heads together

31:04.487 --> 31:08.157

could be a real option.

with the platform technology,
in this case mRNA.

31:37.395 --> 31:41.232
<i>So, as soon as we found out that we were</i>
<i>dealing with a brand new virus,</i>

31:41.399 --> 31:46.988
we said, "This what we do.
We make vaccines. Let's do it."

31:47.071 --> 31:50.575
This is a very exciting technology
at the mRNA vaccines

31:50.867 --> 31:52.118
and it's extremely exciting,

31:52.201 --> 31:54.787
but I don't believe a single one of them
has ever reached market.

<i>It's incredibly impressive</i>

31:58.583 --> 32:01.711
<i>that they made that call,</i>
<i>because it's a bold one.</i>

32:02.128 --> 32:06.382
It took some amount of courage
to move forward with something

32:06.466 --> 32:08.551
that you know isn't an absolute certainty.

32:08.760 --> 32:10.720
I talked to Tony Fauci yesterday,

32:10.803 --> 32:13.306
the Head of the National Institute
of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.

32:13.473 --> 32:16.309
A vaccine is in the works,
but it's a couple of years away.

32:16.559 --> 32:19.729
The fastest we had ever developed
a vaccine before that was for mumps

32:19.812 --> 32:20.855
and that took four years.

32:20.939 --> 32:22.732
And so, we're able to move
very, very fast,

32:22.857 --> 32:26.235
so as soon as we get the phase one dose
out of the NIH,

32:26.527 --> 32:28.196
we'll be able to start phase two
right away.

32:28.446 --> 32:31.157
You're talking over the next few months
you think you could have a vaccine?

32:31.240 --> 32:32.992
-Correct.
-With phase two.

32:33.701 --> 32:37.330
Yeah. You won't have a vaccine.
You'll have a vaccine to go into testing.

32:37.538 --> 32:38.581
MALE VOICE: Testing, yes.

32:39.248 --> 32:42.418
Well, you have the greatest companies
in the world sitting around the table.

32:42.502 --> 32:45.838
I mean, Johnson & Johnson and Pfizer
and all of the companies. Gilead.

32:46.214 --> 32:49.217
Uh, you have all of these great companies
and that's what they're saying,

32:49.384 --> 32:50.802
so I think that...

32:51.052 --> 32:53.846
DR. FAUCI: Would you make sure you get
the President the information

32:53.930 --> 32:57.850
that a vaccine that you make
and start testing in a year

32:57.934 --> 32:59.811
is not a vaccine that's deployable.

33:00.061 --> 33:03.481
So, he's asking the question
"When is it gonna be deployable?"

33:03.815 --> 33:07.610
and that is gonna be, at the earliest,
a year to a year and half,

33:07.694 --> 33:09.320
no matter how fast you go.

33:09.654 --> 33:13.408
I met with the President and with Tony
and a few others in the room

33:13.491 --> 33:14.575
on a couple of occasions.

33:15.702 --> 33:19.789
<i>Oftentimes it was Tony</i>
<i>who was seen as the main proponent</i>

33:19.872 --> 33:21.374
<i>of the unpopular view.</i>

33:21.457 --> 33:25.211
You take a solid flu vaccine,
you don't think that would have an impact

33:25.294 --> 33:27.171
or much of an impact on corona?

could help treat the coronavirus.

and I got better, therefore, it works.

35:18.991 --> 35:22.537

that there was no evidence whatsoever

Yes, John.

JOHN ROBERTS: A question
for Dr. Fauci, if I could.

35:33.172 --> 35:36.717
Dr. Fauci, it was explained yesterday
there has been some promise

35:36.801 --> 35:38.344
with hydroxychloroquine,

35:38.427 --> 35:41.806
this potential therapy for people
who are infected with coronavirus.

35:42.098 --> 35:45.518
Is there any evidence to suggest
that, as with malaria,

35:45.601 --> 35:48.104
it might be used as a prophylaxis
against COVID-19?

35:48.271 --> 35:52.650
No. The answer is no and the evidence
that you're talking about, John,

35:52.733 --> 35:54.235
is anecdotal evidence.

35:54.318 --> 35:58.114
That was the first time that publicly,
with all the cameras rolling,

35:58.322 --> 36:02.326
I just had to get up and contradict him.

36:02.827 --> 36:05.538
But the information
that you are referring to specifically

36:05.663 --> 36:08.833
is anecdotal. It was not done
in a controlled clinical trial,

36:08.958 --> 36:11.377
so you really can't make
any definitive statement about it.

DR. FAUCI: <i>When I stepped back</i>
<i>from the podium,</i>

36:14.714 --> 36:21.387
I remembered the advice that I got
decades earlier by my good friend

36:21.470 --> 36:26.809
who said, "Whenever you go
into the White House, you should assume

36:26.893 --> 36:30.104
"that there's a possibility
that you're not gonna get asked back,

36:30.521 --> 36:34.066
because you might have to tell somebody
something they didn't want to hear."

36:34.233 --> 36:37.820

"Well, this may be it."

that... I don't...

It's amusing, it's interesting,
but you can't take it seriously,

49:25.379 --> 49:28.173

that you're something that you're not.

50:15.929 --> 50:20.058

I bet they couldn't have.

50:35.824 --> 50:38.618
He's running for something.
Does anybody know what?

50:38.869 --> 50:41.079
Because, above all,
you must never mock

50:41.163 --> 50:42.998

50:44.041 --> 50:47.335
Tony's been criticized for a lot of things
during this pandemic.

50:47.753 --> 50:50.297
Some of those he deserves,
like the mask guidance.

50:50.380 --> 50:52.049
I think that was confusing for people.

50:52.466 --> 50:54.342
In March, Fauci told <i>60 Minutes</i>

50:54.468 --> 50:56.928
there's no reason
to be walking around with a mask.

50:57.804 --> 50:58.972
Well, there was.

50:59.181 --> 51:03.351
He felt he was going by the best
of what science offered at the time

51:03.477 --> 51:05.854
and he's obviously been beaten up about it
quite a bit.

51:07.105 --> 51:09.399
But it still is something I wonder about.

51:11.693 --> 51:14.529
DR. FAUCI: <i>Early on,</i>
<i>the White House Coronavirus Task Force</i>

<i>a shortage of masks.</i>

a lot of asymptomatic spread.

51:23.872 --> 51:25.040
We didn't know that.

51:25.207 --> 51:28.794
Under those circumstances I said,
"We shouldn't really be wearing masks."

51:30.587 --> 51:34.591
<i>And then when we found out</i>
<i>that 50 percent of the transmissions</i>

51:34.674 --> 51:38.428

then it became clear,

51:38.512 --> 51:41.431

we really should be wearing a mask.

52:09.918 --> 52:12.170
-Well...
-PETER: <i>From the exterior,</i>

52:12.254 --> 52:16.091

52:16.633 --> 52:19.427
DR. FAUCI:
Well, I think you just nailed it there,

52:19.553 --> 52:24.558

52:50.750 --> 52:53.295
What does having a Twitter account
actually mean?

52:53.545 --> 52:57.591
You've got to type some stuff in

52:58.008 --> 53:00.844
Do you got to respond to things?
I don't have any minutes.

53:08.310 --> 53:09.936

53:16.151 --> 53:18.236

53:33.793 --> 53:37.088
Here's the bad part.
When you do testing to that extent,

53:37.172 --> 53:39.549
you're gonna find more people,
you're gonna find more cases.

53:39.925 --> 53:43.803
So I said to my people,
"Slow the testing down, please."

53:45.722 --> 53:47.766
FRANK PALLONE: <i>So, Dr. Fauci,</i>

53:48.433 --> 53:49.476

Dr. Anthony Fauci

These are the people who know

DR. FAUCI: <i>I started to put myself</i>

1:06:19.558 --> 1:06:21.394

about that.

<i>Typical day at the NIH</i>
<i>watching people die!</i>

<i>And the commander says,</i>
<i>"Take him through the building."</i>

1:39:35.761 --> 1:39:37.972
If we had just gotten it

1:39:38.097 --> 1:39:40.975
a day earlier, a week earlier,
a month earlier...

1:39:41.684 --> 1:39:43.852
these number of people
would not have died.

1:39:55.114 --> 1:39:59.284
<i>One of the most mysterious aspects</i>
<i>of our universe</i>

1:39:59.576 --> 1:40:06.000
<i>is how viruses have transformed</i>
<i>our civilization.</i>

1:40:13.382 --> 1:40:16.427
<i>There was a Nobel Prize-winning</i>
<i>bacteriologist</i>

1:40:16.677 --> 1:40:21.432
<i>named Joshua Lederberg, who says,</i>
<i>"It's a never-ending battle</i>

1:40:21.765 --> 1:40:27.146
<i>"between viruses'</i>
<i>spectacular genetic capability,</i>

1:40:27.229 --> 1:40:28.731
<i>"and our wits."</i>

1:40:38.365 --> 1:40:40.951
<i>As someone at my age</i>
<i>and my stage in life,</i>

1:40:41.827 --> 1:40:44.163
<i>it's natural to look ahead and say,</i>

1:40:44.288 --> 1:40:46.790
<i>"What are my children</i>
<i>gonna be faced with?"</i>

1:40:48.042 --> 1:40:51.587
And the one thing I can hope for...
really hope for,

1:40:52.171 --> 1:40:57.468
is that emerging infections
don't inevitably become pandemics.

1:41:01.847 --> 1:41:05.517
<i>I am optimistic that the lessons</i>
<i>that we've learned</i>

1:41:06.310 --> 1:41:08.020
<i>will prevent that from happening.</i>

1:41:15.694 --> 1:41:18.238
<i>I hope that if historians look back...</i>

1:41:19.114 --> 1:41:22.076
if they ever would wanna look back...
(LAUGHS)

1:41:22.576 --> 1:41:25.287
<i>...at what I've done, and my life.</i>

1:41:26.789 --> 1:41:30.667
Maybe somebody says,
"Hey, that guy was pretty good."

1:41:33.128 --> 1:41:37.758
