00:01.456 --> 00:02.456
- Previously on <i>Awkward...</i>

00:02.458 --> 00:03.791
- The dude database
has gone full-on viral.

00:03.793 --> 00:05.359
- This is gonna really piss
some people off.

00:05.361 --> 00:07.127
Hey, I thought you said
we couldn't delete

00:07.129 --> 00:08.829
this stupid database.
- No!

00:08.831 --> 00:11.431
Jenna, I didn't mean
you can't delete it!

00:11.433 --> 00:12.699
I mean don't [Bleep] delete it!

00:12.701 --> 00:15.502
[Cell phones chime]

00:17.338 --> 00:18.739
- They were calling it
the great repression.

00:18.741 --> 00:20.674
There was a full-scale hookup
drought at Palos Hills high,

00:20.676 --> 00:23.977
and the halls were haunted
by aggro, sex-starved teens.

00:23.979 --> 00:25.746
Guys thought it was cool
to rank girls,

00:25.748 --> 00:27.381
but when the hashtag
was on the other foot,

00:27.383 --> 00:31.418
they freaked, making for
a very awkward Valentine's Day.

00:31.420 --> 00:33.287
- It's like
a dating dust bowl out here.

00:33.289 --> 00:35.389
If things don't pick up,
I'm gonna have to cancel

00:35.391 --> 00:36.356
the Valentine's dance.

00:36.358 --> 00:38.425
- That's a tad dramatic.
- Dramatic?

00:38.427 --> 00:41.528
Valentine's Day is like
the super bowl of drama, Jenna.

00:41.530 --> 00:43.297
Do you see a single girl
around here

00:43.299 --> 00:45.299
with flowers or chocolates
or hope?

00:45.301 --> 00:47.301
The great repression
has made it impossible to love.

00:47.303 --> 00:50.571
- I would think the guys would
be happy to be off the hook

00:50.573 --> 00:51.538
for Valentine's Day.

00:51.540 --> 00:52.506
They hate buying flowers.

00:52.508 --> 00:55.976
- Uh, Google Earth to Jenna,
BJs are like flowers for dudes.

00:55.978 --> 00:58.545
You ruined that for them too.
- Me?

00:58.547 --> 00:59.813
We both started
the dude database.

00:59.815 --> 01:02.783
- But only one of us
control-alt-outed herself

01:02.785 --> 01:05.419
as the administrator.

01:05.421 --> 01:08.055
- Oh! What are those?

01:08.057 --> 01:08.822
- Blue balls.

01:08.824 --> 01:13.894
You gave them to us,
so now we're giving them back.

01:21.102 --> 01:23.837
- Thanks for ruining
Valentine's Day.

01:23.839 --> 01:26.106
- Okay, this is ridiculous.

01:26.108 --> 01:28.609
- I told you not to delete it,
and you didn't listen.

01:28.611 --> 01:30.978
I am not becoming
a pariah Carey over this.

01:30.980 --> 01:34.815
- Fine, I'm just gonna have to
save Valentine's Day by myself?

01:34.817 --> 01:35.616
- Let's face it.

01:35.618 --> 01:37.818
Valentine's Day
is off this year.

01:37.820 --> 01:41.421
- Valentine's Day
is so on this year.

01:41.423 --> 01:43.056
I wonder what will
has planned for me.

01:43.058 --> 01:45.859
You know that he started out
as my stalker?

01:45.861 --> 01:49.963
And Valentine's Day is like
the world series of stalking.

01:49.965 --> 01:52.933
- Um, why am I here again?

01:52.935 --> 01:56.370
- Oh, right, do you mind
explaining this paper?

01:56.372 --> 01:58.906
- Ms. Marks, do you know
what it's like to learn

01:58.908 --> 01:59.973
your entire life has been a lie?

01:59.975 --> 02:03.143
- When I was 14, I found out
that the woman I thought

02:03.145 --> 02:05.379
was my sister
was actually my mom.

02:05.381 --> 02:06.647
Is that the kind of thing
you mean?

02:06.649 --> 02:09.082
- Then you understand how
it makes you question everything

02:09.084 --> 02:11.818
you once took
as the for-sure truth!

02:11.820 --> 02:12.552
- I guess.

02:12.554 --> 02:14.688
- Ever since my dad
was sent to gay rehab

02:14.690 --> 02:17.090
and my mother sent my brother--

02:17.092 --> 02:18.859
no, my boyfriend--

02:18.861 --> 02:20.961
my brother to live
with another family,

02:20.963 --> 02:24.164
I'm finding it hard
to trust God's plan.

02:24.166 --> 02:26.533
So I'm writing
about my journey.

02:26.535 --> 02:29.102
- Okay, it's just that
you were supposed to write

02:29.104 --> 02:30.003
about the new deal.

02:30.005 --> 02:32.506
- The new deal was
a real lifesaver.

02:32.508 --> 02:34.608
It got people back to work,

02:34.610 --> 02:37.444
infused energy
into our economy,

02:37.446 --> 02:41.715
and pretty much ended
the great depression.

02:41.717 --> 02:42.516
- That was it.

02:42.518 --> 02:43.817
I needed a new deal to get us

02:43.819 --> 02:47.454
out of this great repression,
and I had an idea.

02:47.456 --> 02:48.722
[School bell rings]

02:48.724 --> 02:51.124
I need the best one you've got.

02:51.126 --> 02:51.892
Wait, how much?

02:51.894 --> 02:54.895
Okay, what can I get
for 200 bucks?

02:54.897 --> 02:55.696
Great, thank you.

02:55.698 --> 02:58.699
- What are you finally blowing
your babysitting money on?

02:58.701 --> 03:03.136
Because if it's clothes, I have
some constructive suggestions.

03:03.138 --> 03:04.137
- Not clothes, a party bus.

03:04.139 --> 03:07.207
It's my new deal, and it is
gonna end the hookup drought.

03:07.209 --> 03:09.876
- Hey, Jenna, I heard
about the hurt locker

03:09.878 --> 03:10.844
full of blue balls, yeesh.

03:10.846 --> 03:13.080
Don't sweat it--it'll all
blow over in, like, 12 months

03:13.082 --> 03:16.583
when we're all in college and
spread out all over the country.

03:16.585 --> 03:17.117
- Try 24 hours.

03:17.119 --> 03:20.620
I rented us a party bus
for the dance tomorrow night,

03:20.622 --> 03:21.655
and you both better be on it.

03:21.657 --> 03:24.591
- How is a party bus going
to sexify the student body?

03:24.593 --> 03:26.193
- Do you remember
when the Julies got

03:26.195 --> 03:28.628
that double-Decker
for their sweet 16?

03:28.630 --> 03:29.463
- Oh, I remember.

03:29.465 --> 03:30.664
- I was practically
the only one

03:30.666 --> 03:32.566
that didn't lose their
vehicular virginity that night.

03:32.568 --> 03:35.769
- Exactly. On a party bus,
there are no parents,

03:35.771 --> 03:37.671
the driver looks the other way,
and there are plenty

03:37.673 --> 03:39.706
of nasty nooks and crannies
to get your freak on.

03:39.708 --> 03:43.744
- Well, Jenna, it's a lot to
ask, but if it helps the cause,

03:43.746 --> 03:45.512
I'm on board
with your party bus.

03:45.514 --> 03:46.913
- At least one guy
wasn't holding

03:46.915 --> 03:48.148
the hookup drought against me.

03:48.150 --> 03:50.717
Actually, he was
holding himself against me,

03:50.719 --> 03:52.152
and it felt pretty great.

03:52.154 --> 03:57.891
- So, Willy-yum, Saturday night,
what's the plan?

03:57.893 --> 03:58.792
A little role play?

03:58.794 --> 04:02.963
A little, uh,
chaps and chapstick?

04:02.965 --> 04:04.865
- Saturday, Saturday, uh...

04:04.867 --> 04:08.802
Oh, I'm actually headed out
of town for a dive this weekend.

04:08.804 --> 04:14.074
- Well, do you have
a Val-ID reason

04:14.076 --> 04:17.744
for your time away?

04:17.746 --> 04:22.049
- Yeah, I just need
a little R&R.

04:22.051 --> 04:26.887
- Do you want to
maybe ree-Val-uate the situation

04:26.889 --> 04:28.188
before you leave?

04:28.190 --> 04:32.192
- No, I'm good.

04:32.194 --> 04:34.161
See ya.

04:34.163 --> 04:37.664
- All right.
Booze, check.

04:37.666 --> 04:39.900
Tequila for the teases.
Rum to have fun.

04:39.902 --> 04:42.135
Beer for no fear.
And vodka...

04:42.137 --> 04:43.870
Doesn't rhyme with anything.
Ugh.

04:43.872 --> 04:46.907
I should've gotten whiskey.
Whiskey makes you frisky.

04:46.909 --> 04:48.909
That's a good one.
- That's a good one.

04:48.911 --> 04:53.080
I can't believe you're
ditching me to go serve sausages

04:53.082 --> 04:53.880
to sad singles.

04:53.882 --> 04:55.715
- Lonely people stuff
their faces on Valentine's Day.

04:55.717 --> 04:57.717
It's one of the biggest nights
of the year for the truck.

04:57.719 --> 04:59.586
I can't afford to take off
whenever I want.

04:59.588 --> 05:01.955
- And I can't afford
your lame excuses.

05:01.957 --> 05:02.556
See ya.

05:02.558 --> 05:05.559
- The only heart you give me
today, sadita, is heartburn.

05:05.561 --> 05:09.329
- I hope you choke
on a chalupa.

05:11.065 --> 05:13.567
- Looks like we're each other's
Valentines. Girls' night!

05:13.569 --> 05:15.769
- Ew, the only women who are
happy about a girls' night

05:15.771 --> 05:20.207
on Valentine's Day are single,
30-year-old sex-and-the-sads.

05:20.209 --> 05:21.041
- I'm not sad.

05:21.043 --> 05:24.277
I'm just not sure
if God exists or not.

05:24.279 --> 05:28.014
- When's the panty dropper
supposed to arrive?

05:28.016 --> 05:29.349
I meant the party bus.

05:29.351 --> 05:32.285
- Matty was definitely doing
his part to get girls

05:32.287 --> 05:33.220
feeling romantic again.

05:33.222 --> 05:35.622
If all the guys looked as good
as he did tonight,

05:35.624 --> 05:39.926
I was sure to succeed
with my plan to bring sexy back.

05:39.928 --> 05:43.763
Unfortunately, Matty's plan
was to bring Gabby.

05:43.765 --> 05:45.332
- Hey, great turnout.

05:45.334 --> 05:46.700
- Yeah, great.

05:46.702 --> 05:49.769
- Thanks for organizing this.

05:50.071 --> 05:52.339
- Why would he bring her?
It's Valentine's Day.

05:52.341 --> 05:55.242
He said it was nothing serious.
- A party bus isn't serious.

05:55.244 --> 05:58.011
I thought your agenda was
to get people together tonight.

05:58.013 --> 06:00.814
- It is.
It's just a little...

06:00.816 --> 06:02.616
Weirder with some people.

06:02.618 --> 06:04.251
- I get it, but don't spin.

06:04.253 --> 06:05.752
We have a DJ for that.
Focus.

06:05.754 --> 06:08.355
Tonight's about ending
the drought and not obsessing

06:08.357 --> 06:10.090
over ex-boyfriends.

06:10.092 --> 06:13.627
- Hello, ladies.
- Whoa, <i>Back to the Future</i> much?

06:13.629 --> 06:17.097
- Yeah, well, I realized
the no-effort look had become

06:17.099 --> 06:19.766
too much effort for me.

06:19.768 --> 06:21.835
- Okay, did Jake
hire a swag coach?

06:21.837 --> 06:25.705
- Hey, what did you just say?
No obsessing over exes.

06:25.707 --> 06:26.773
[Horn honking]

06:26.775 --> 06:27.874
Is that--

06:27.876 --> 06:30.043
[all groan]

06:31.679 --> 06:34.848
- It's not a party bus.
That's a stripper's meth lab.

06:34.850 --> 06:38.852
- It's a dream.
- Nice work, Hamiltrash.

06:40.821 --> 06:43.757
- 'Sup? Gonna need to see
those Benjamins up front, brah.

06:43.759 --> 06:45.825
- This bus was
the opposite of sexy,

06:45.827 --> 06:47.093
and did he just say "Benjamins"?

06:47.095 --> 06:50.096
But did FDR give up
when he got polio?

06:50.098 --> 06:51.431
No.
- Let's go.

06:51.433 --> 06:55.335
- All right, guys,
let's get this party mobile.

06:55.337 --> 06:59.873
Some booze and some bling.

07:01.209 --> 07:03.076
- Did something die in here?

07:03.078 --> 07:05.445
- Someone, but that was,
like, weeks ago.

07:05.447 --> 07:08.081
Don't worry.
I febrezed.

07:08.083 --> 07:09.282
- Come on, guys.

07:09.284 --> 07:11.751
It's not that bad.

07:11.753 --> 07:14.287
Look, all right, all right.

07:14.289 --> 07:17.123
Holla, party people.

07:17.125 --> 07:19.359
[All gasp]

07:20.895 --> 07:22.762
- So far, my party bus was
more like a funeral procession.

07:22.764 --> 07:24.864
No one seemed
to want to be there,

07:24.866 --> 07:26.666
except for Matty and Gabby.

07:26.668 --> 07:27.567
I had to do something.

07:27.569 --> 07:31.338
All right, time for a little
"never have I ever."

07:31.340 --> 07:34.774
- Can't have any open containers
while I'm driving.

07:34.776 --> 07:35.609
- Are you serious?

07:35.611 --> 07:37.811
- What happened to looking
the other way?

07:37.813 --> 07:40.013
- About six DUIs.

07:40.015 --> 07:45.318
- All right, we'll just
play with warm water.

07:46.988 --> 07:50.924
All right,
who wants to go first?

07:52.260 --> 07:53.226
Anyone?

07:53.228 --> 07:53.994
- I'll go.

07:53.996 --> 07:58.164
Never have I ever ridden in
something so sick and revolting.

07:58.166 --> 08:01.101
- Or on something.
- Ha.

08:02.136 --> 08:04.804
- My turn,
never have I ever ridden

08:04.806 --> 08:08.174
in a mobile leprosy triage unit.

08:09.076 --> 08:09.843
- I'll go.

08:09.845 --> 08:13.680
Never have I ever gotten it on
with a milf.

08:13.682 --> 08:17.350
- Dude.
- Drink up, bro.

08:17.352 --> 08:19.119
All: Ohh.

08:19.121 --> 08:19.719
- Dirty.

08:19.721 --> 08:21.221
- Okay, I didn't know
we were in the army,

08:21.223 --> 08:25.058
because major shenanigans
just reported for duty.

08:25.060 --> 08:26.293
Who robbed your cradle, Rosati?

08:26.295 --> 08:27.227
- Don't worry about it.

08:27.229 --> 08:28.895
- Okay, well, if we're not
gonna be truthful

08:28.897 --> 08:30.830
in "never have I ever," then we
should play a different game.

08:30.832 --> 08:34.167
- Tamara, believe me.
It's the truth.

08:34.169 --> 08:36.136
- All right, my turn.

08:36.138 --> 08:37.871
Never have I ever

08:37.873 --> 08:41.775
scored triple digits
in mini golf.

08:41.777 --> 08:44.144
You're a straight-up liar,
McKibben. Drink.

08:44.146 --> 08:46.713
- Tonight was supposed to be
about everyone hooking up.

08:46.715 --> 08:50.283
Not everyone watching
Matty and Gabby VDTR.

08:50.285 --> 08:52.686
Valentine's Day
the relationship.

08:52.688 --> 08:54.988
I had to do something, right?

08:54.990 --> 08:56.856
All right, my turn.

08:56.858 --> 09:01.861
Never have I ever
taken someone's virginity.

09:03.297 --> 09:07.267
Matty?
- Right, thank you.

09:07.269 --> 09:09.302
- Uh, chug-a-lug, J.

09:09.304 --> 09:10.170
- Tamara was right.

09:10.172 --> 09:13.340
My recent swipe of Owen's V-card
meant Matty and I were

09:13.342 --> 09:14.341
suddenly drinking buddies.

09:14.343 --> 09:16.176
- Wait, you took
someone's virginity?

09:16.178 --> 09:19.446
- Yeah, yeah--I mean, yes.
- Whose?

09:19.448 --> 09:21.981
- Can we change the subject?
Please?

09:21.983 --> 09:23.783
- So Luke was
a virgin in college?

09:23.785 --> 09:24.951
- [Chuckles]
Loser.

right under "suicide girl"
and "moody slut."

19:10.672 --> 19:13.506
- Like I said,
people were treating me the way

19:13.508 --> 19:15.374
they normally did.

19:15.376 --> 19:18.344
- Hey, have you seen Jake?
- What?

19:18.346 --> 19:20.046
I thought you said
what happened at the dance

19:20.048 --> 19:21.047
was a one-time thing.

19:21.049 --> 19:22.648
- Oh, the remix
to "Tamara Never Comes"

19:22.650 --> 19:26.786
was definitely a single
but certainly a chart topper.

19:26.788 --> 19:29.488
Oh, there he is.

19:29.490 --> 19:30.656
- Can we not?

19:30.658 --> 19:31.691
Matty's mad at me.

19:31.693 --> 19:32.558
- Uh, can you blame him?

19:32.560 --> 19:36.128
Bringing up your sophomoric
sexnanigans in front of Gabby

19:36.130 --> 19:37.229
was not your best moment.

19:37.231 --> 19:38.097
- Tamara was right.

19:38.099 --> 19:40.466
I had told myself I was
giving everyone a new deal,

19:40.468 --> 19:43.402
but what I'd given Matty
was more like a raw deal.

19:43.404 --> 19:47.606
Hey, I just want to say
I'm sorry about what happened

19:47.608 --> 19:48.341
on the bus.

19:48.343 --> 19:51.310
Never have I ever acted like
such an immature idiot.

19:51.312 --> 19:55.681
- Actually, the stripper pole
fail almost makes up for it.

19:55.683 --> 19:56.582
No, I'm sorry too.

19:56.584 --> 20:00.119
I was pretty dickish about it,
but I was just mad.

20:00.121 --> 20:00.653
- Is Gabby mad?

20:00.655 --> 20:03.589
- No, no, she just wants
to take things a little slow.

20:03.591 --> 20:06.559
- Well, not everyone can
move as fast as I can.

20:06.561 --> 20:09.161
- Yeah, I don't think
we'll be hitting that gear

20:09.163 --> 20:10.296
for a little while.

20:10.298 --> 20:11.464
- So she is mad?

20:11.466 --> 20:14.300
- No, she's a virgin.

20:17.104 --> 20:22.174
Which I respect, and some things
are just worth waiting for.

20:22.176 --> 20:24.210
You know what I mean?

20:24.212 --> 20:26.679
- Matty, over here.

20:26.681 --> 20:28.247
- I did know what he meant.

20:28.249 --> 20:30.883
Gabby was worth waiting for,

20:30.885 --> 20:33.686
and I hadn't been.

20:35.756 --> 20:37.289
- Next on <i>Awkward...</i>
Happy Birthday!

20:37.291 --> 20:39.558
- Aw, a cupcake!
Laker tickets, holy [Bleep].

20:39.560 --> 20:41.060
- I'm throwing
a little surprise party

20:41.062 --> 20:42.328
for Matty later--
you should come.

20:42.330 --> 20:45.197
- Gabby was a fierce competitor,
but I could be too.

20:45.199 --> 20:48.000
I was gonna be
so [Bleep] friendly, it hurt.

20:48.002 --> 20:49.068
My plans tonight got canceled,

20:49.070 --> 20:51.337
and I can definitely come
to the party.

20:51.339 --> 20:52.271
- Surprise!

20:52.273 --> 20:55.241
That looks like...
Both: Tamara and Sadie!
