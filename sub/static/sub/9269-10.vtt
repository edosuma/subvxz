Go!

00:52.720 --> 00:55.390
When you said
"Let's go to the races",

00:55.440 --> 00:56.830
I thought you meant the horses!

00:56.880 --> 00:58.480
I meant horsepower!

CAR ROARS

01:02.160 --> 01:08.550
Ah! MG Bellevue Special.
1935. 180 brake horsepower.

01:08.600 --> 01:10.710
What a beauty!

01:10.760 --> 01:13.510
Father Brown, thank you all
so much for coming.

01:13.560 --> 01:15.950
I never had you pegged as a
motoring enthusiast?

01:16.000 --> 01:17.870
Oh, I'm not, but the Earl's been
called away

01:17.920 --> 01:19.950
on business so I've taken over
hosting duties.

01:20.000 --> 01:22.590
Oh, well, that would
account for the champagne.

01:22.640 --> 01:25.390
Well, as long as none
of the drivers are partaking.

01:25.440 --> 01:27.430
I don't want to make any
arrests on my day off.

01:27.480 --> 01:29.720
Inspector, you have my word.
Hand on heart.

01:32.040 --> 01:33.190
'27!

01:33.240 --> 01:38.470
'28. The Terror. 1496cc.
Methanol-driven and supercharged.

01:38.520 --> 01:40.200
Wouldn't mind having
a whirl in that.

01:42.000 --> 01:46.630
What is it about cars that turns
grown men into little boys?

01:46.680 --> 01:49.510
Audrey. It's been far too long.

01:49.560 --> 01:51.950
Felicia, darling!
So lovely to see you!

Audrey MacMurray - property magnate,
racing track owner,

01:56.640 --> 02:00.310
philanthropist, daredevil...
Have I missed something out?

02:00.360 --> 02:02.710
Ruthless businesswoman.

02:02.760 --> 02:06.590
You're the one who donated to St
Silvia's Orphanage last Christmas.

02:06.640 --> 02:08.229
A rare moment of weakness.

02:08.280 --> 02:10.630
For which I know the children are
very grateful.

02:10.680 --> 02:13.990
They're more than welcome.
Audrey MacMurray? Yes.

02:14.040 --> 02:15.200
I'm Harriet Welsby.

02:16.680 --> 02:18.080
Ow!

02:21.480 --> 02:23.120
You killed my husband!

02:24.240 --> 02:25.280
You'll pay for it.

03:07.880 --> 03:10.150
Why did she say you killed
her husband?

03:10.200 --> 03:11.430
I have no idea.

03:11.480 --> 03:14.240
And it's hardly
any of your business. Thank you.

03:16.120 --> 03:18.520
She wasn't all there,
if you ask me.

03:19.640 --> 03:21.910
People in grief rarely are.
ENGINES ROAR

03:21.960 --> 03:24.510
Can't find her,
she's disappeared into the crowd.

03:24.560 --> 03:26.270
How'd she run?

03:26.320 --> 03:29.150
She's overheating a bit.
Take her in and check her out.

03:29.200 --> 03:31.790
Are you trying to get yourself
killed? Oh, what now?

03:31.840 --> 03:34.630
Starting the practice
run before I've run the safety car.

03:34.680 --> 03:36.430
Darling, you're so protective.

03:36.480 --> 03:39.910
Right now, I'm not your husband,
I'm the clerk of this course,

03:39.960 --> 03:41.870
and it's my responsibility to
make sure

03:41.920 --> 03:43.480
nobody takes unnecessary risks.

03:44.800 --> 03:46.840
I must say,
you've done very well there.

03:47.880 --> 03:49.510
Ex-football player, no less.

03:49.560 --> 03:52.310
Poor dear had to give it up
because of a knee injury.

03:52.360 --> 03:54.870
I bet he's dynamite in the...

03:54.920 --> 03:57.150
As I was saying.

03:57.200 --> 04:01.750
Excuse us - marital spat.
What? What is it?

04:01.800 --> 04:04.360
Mrs McCarthy, you're wearing your
scandalised face.

04:05.680 --> 04:07.680
She's old enough to be his mother.

04:08.840 --> 04:11.750
All I ask
is that you follow the rules.

04:11.800 --> 04:15.870
I never follow rules, darling,
you should know that by now.

04:15.920 --> 04:20.269
Mrs MacMurray! Telephone messages
and some paperwork for you to sign.

04:20.320 --> 04:22.710
Can't it wait?
No rest for the wicked.

04:22.760 --> 04:25.280
Why don't you help Gary
with my engine? It's overheating.

04:26.280 --> 04:28.390
Good boy.

04:28.440 --> 04:31.390
Mr Baxter's asking for another
extension on the rent.

04:31.440 --> 04:35.110
He's had two weeks already.
Start eviction proceedings.

04:35.160 --> 04:36.870
And Mr Drew called, wanting to know
if you

04:36.920 --> 04:39.190
could delay repossession
until he's found a house...

04:39.240 --> 04:41.310
Out of the question.
If we do it for him,

04:41.360 --> 04:43.190
we have to do it for everyone.

04:43.240 --> 04:44.590
Only... Only what?

04:44.640 --> 04:46.600
He was very upset on the telephone.

04:47.760 --> 04:50.230
Phyllis, listen to me.

04:50.280 --> 04:52.470
If you're going to
succeed in business,

04:52.520 --> 04:55.680
you have to learn to not let
sentimentality cloud your judgement.

04:57.280 --> 04:58.950
You'll learn.

04:59.000 --> 05:01.910
By the way, do we have anyone called
Welsby on our books?

05:01.960 --> 05:04.750
Um...Welsby...

05:04.800 --> 05:06.710
Oh, yes. Alistair Welsby.

05:06.760 --> 05:10.600
Defaulted on his loan three months
ago. Repossession in progress.

05:11.600 --> 05:13.720
Is there something wrong? No.

05:15.480 --> 05:18.600
Well, good luck. I'm sure you'll win.
I always do.

05:25.080 --> 05:27.990
Keep coming, keep coming...
Hold it there.

05:28.040 --> 05:30.520
Three, two, one - go!

05:54.960 --> 05:56.320
HE WHISTLES

06:00.040 --> 06:01.840
HE URINATES

06:07.880 --> 06:09.680
HE CHUCKLES

06:11.640 --> 06:14.030
I'm not entirely sure you're
allowed to be in here.

06:14.080 --> 06:16.760
Hey, I own this place.
(I can go wherever I want.)

06:18.560 --> 06:20.520
Do you like older women? Uh...

06:22.400 --> 06:28.720
Oh, I love men who give monosyllabic
answers. It's so...primal.

06:31.520 --> 06:34.320
You're married.
Yeah. (Let's live dangerously.)

06:36.920 --> 06:39.200
Mmm. Mmm.

06:45.240 --> 06:48.200
Sorry. Didn't mean to interrupt.

06:52.040 --> 06:53.560
Mm.

06:56.080 --> 06:57.920
ENGINE ROARS AND TYRES SCREECH

07:08.960 --> 07:10.320
Problem?

07:13.400 --> 07:15.510
What am I to you? Good Lord.

07:15.560 --> 07:17.590
Don't tell me
you're starting to have feelings.

07:17.640 --> 07:20.350
Your working class bit of rough,
is it?

07:20.400 --> 07:22.760
You're my employee. That's it.

07:24.200 --> 07:26.990
Maybe I should have a word
with your husband.

07:27.040 --> 07:28.640
Tell him what a tart you are.

07:31.680 --> 07:33.560
Forgotten who the fairer sex is?

07:34.680 --> 07:37.640
Ugh! Not at all. You're fired.

07:38.840 --> 07:40.070
What happened?

07:40.120 --> 07:42.630
I caught him trying to stare down
my top.

07:42.680 --> 07:44.070
You filthy...

07:44.120 --> 07:47.390
Unnecessary, darling.
Already dealt him a punishing blow.

07:47.440 --> 07:50.870
You can't stop me from defending your
honour. What honour?

07:50.920 --> 07:52.910
Get out!

07:52.960 --> 07:55.710
I feel sorry for you.
RACE STEWARD: Three, two, one - go!

07:55.760 --> 07:57.400
The both of you.

07:59.840 --> 08:01.110
You should've let me hit him.

08:01.160 --> 08:02.950
Oh, don't be silly, darling!

08:03.000 --> 08:06.670
He's almost twice your size -
give or take an inch or two.

08:06.720 --> 08:09.560
I'm racing in ten minutes,
haven't you got a job to do?

08:12.040 --> 08:14.790
I'll run the safety car. Good.

08:14.840 --> 08:16.270
Mrs MacMurray!

08:16.320 --> 08:19.560
It's Mr Baxter. He's threatening
legal action. Coming.

08:40.080 --> 08:41.990
Ladies and gentleman,

08:42.039 --> 08:47.590
welcome to the Earl's 14th annual
Charity Hill Climb Meeting.

08:47.640 --> 08:51.710
I hope you've enjoyed the practice
runs. As you can see,

08:51.760 --> 08:57.150
we have a wide range of vehicles
competing in the race,

08:57.200 --> 09:03.040
in a, in a...variety of colours,
shapes and sizes.

09:04.200 --> 09:06.680
Colours and shapes(!)
And sizes.

09:07.840 --> 09:09.830
We'll begin in just a few moments,

09:09.880 --> 09:15.240
once the track has been checked for
hazards and, erm, that sort of thing.

09:48.400 --> 09:49.840
Been busy?

09:59.480 --> 10:03.840
LADY FELICIA:
I hereby declare this meeting open.

10:12.760 --> 10:14.590
I don't understand this.

10:14.640 --> 10:17.430
How are they all supposed to
fit on one track?

10:17.480 --> 10:20.270
They don't, Mrs McCarthy.
They go one at a time.

10:20.320 --> 10:21.670
One at a time?

10:21.720 --> 10:24.590
The clue's in the title.
Thousand-yard uphill track.

10:24.640 --> 10:27.390
The fastest to make
it to the top is the winner.

10:27.440 --> 10:29.590
Well, it sounds very dull to me.

10:29.640 --> 10:31.750
I can assure you,
it's far from that.

10:31.800 --> 10:33.430
And not a cream tea in sight.

10:33.480 --> 10:38.400
Our first contestant - uh,
driver, is Audrey MacMurray.

10:45.760 --> 10:47.790
Good luck, darling.

10:47.840 --> 10:49.550
Driving a, uh...

10:49.600 --> 10:54.270
Frazer Nash Special...1926.

10:54.320 --> 10:55.910
'27. '28.

10:55.960 --> 10:58.390
Oh, I'd love to have a whirl
in that.

10:58.440 --> 11:02.710
It has lots of various
specifications, which, eh...

11:02.760 --> 11:06.750
to be honest, I don't completely
understand. But, as you can see,

11:06.800 --> 11:11.350
it's in a lovely shade of blue -
Prussian blue, I'd say -

11:11.400 --> 11:15.230
w-w-hich.....creating a striking
counterpoint

11:15.280 --> 11:19.750
to her figgy, plummy red jumpsuit.

11:19.800 --> 11:21.950
Just what I came for -
a fashion show.

11:22.000 --> 11:24.110
In any case, it's a magnificent
machine,

11:24.160 --> 11:25.720
as I'm sure you'll all agree.

11:27.160 --> 11:30.320
Three, two, one - go!

11:31.400 --> 11:33.160
And she's off!

11:36.120 --> 11:41.640
Look how fast she's going,
and getting faster...and faster.

11:54.440 --> 11:56.240
Gosh, she really is going fast!

12:04.160 --> 12:05.680
TYRES SCREECH

12:06.760 --> 12:08.230
SPECTATORS GASP

12:08.280 --> 12:10.160
SCREAM ECHOES OVER PA SYSTEM

12:30.400 --> 12:31.680
I'm sorry.

12:49.680 --> 12:51.150
HE SPEAKS LATIN

12:51.200 --> 12:55.350
It doesn't make any sense. Why would
she just go off the track?

12:55.400 --> 12:57.910
She wouldn't.
She was an excellent driver.

12:57.960 --> 13:01.430
Hazard on the track?
I checked it myself, it was safe.

13:01.480 --> 13:03.950
Mr MacMurray, why don't you
wait in the starter's office?

13:04.000 --> 13:07.030
Let us do our jobs.
I'll make him a cup of tea.

13:07.080 --> 13:09.040
Check the track. Inspector.

13:11.880 --> 13:15.070
Piece of fabric. Curious.

13:15.120 --> 13:17.350
SHE SCREAMS

13:17.400 --> 13:19.910
Be careful, Madam. Ooh!

13:19.960 --> 13:23.030
What happened?
Seems like she lost control.

13:23.080 --> 13:25.830
That's not possible.
She never lost control.

13:25.880 --> 13:27.430
Brake lines have been cut.

13:27.480 --> 13:30.310
Just enough to drain the reservoir
before the car got up to speed.

13:30.360 --> 13:32.240
It must've been that mad woman.

13:33.400 --> 13:36.070
Thank you, Mrs McCarthy.
What would I do without you?

13:36.120 --> 13:37.710
Let's track down this
Harriet Welsby.

13:37.760 --> 13:39.550
Welsby? I have the address.

13:39.600 --> 13:41.120
Let's get that arm looked at.

13:45.000 --> 13:48.200
So...you and Mrs MacMurray...

13:52.240 --> 13:55.200
Burn, did she? Alive, I hope.

13:56.400 --> 14:00.270
Initial reports indicate a fractured
skull. Dead on impact.

14:00.320 --> 14:01.880
Oh, well. Can't have everything.

14:04.920 --> 14:09.240
Tea? No, thank you.
Yes, please, three sugars. No.

14:11.320 --> 14:12.680
We're both fine.

14:15.240 --> 14:19.190
Apologies for the mess. The house
is being repossessed.

14:19.240 --> 14:22.400
By Mrs MacMurray's company?
By that evil witch, yes.

14:23.440 --> 14:26.390
Seeing as we're being
blunt, about your husband...

14:26.440 --> 14:30.750
I buried him this morning.
He had a heart attack.

14:30.800 --> 14:32.630
And you blame
Mrs MacMurray for that?

14:32.680 --> 14:34.750
It was her repayment demands.

14:34.800 --> 14:37.040
He never had heart
problems before that. I see.

14:38.520 --> 14:40.640
And when you said,
"You'll pay for it"?

14:42.760 --> 14:45.230
You accusing me of something?
There's evidence to suggest

14:45.280 --> 14:47.160
Mrs MacMurray's car was sabotaged.

14:49.160 --> 14:52.320
This gets better and better!
And, of course, I'm a suspect(!)

14:53.600 --> 14:56.550
Where did you go after
your confrontation this morning?

14:56.600 --> 14:58.600
Straight home.
Can anyone vouch for you?

15:00.040 --> 15:02.000
Medusa. Medusa?

15:03.480 --> 15:06.830
My cat. She's around here somewhere.
Shall I fetch her for you?

15:06.880 --> 15:09.960
On second thoughts,
maybe we will have that cup of tea.

15:11.440 --> 15:12.480
Of course.

15:13.680 --> 15:16.920
Fly-fishing. Your husband's?
Yes, please don't touch it.

15:36.680 --> 15:40.350
Spiritual guidance only.
Understand?

15:40.400 --> 15:41.680
Absolutely.

15:44.720 --> 15:45.880
Thank you.

15:51.920 --> 15:53.150
DOOR SLAMS

15:53.200 --> 15:57.480
Thank you for coming,
Father. I'm what you call "lapsed".

15:58.760 --> 16:00.000
Is that a problem? No.

16:01.480 --> 16:05.470
Not if you wish to repent.
I'm glad she's dead. Ah.

16:05.520 --> 16:07.360
But I didn't do it. Go on.

16:09.360 --> 16:12.950
When Mrs MacMurray's assistant
called her into the office,

16:13.000 --> 16:16.200
I found the cable cutters,
and I tried to cut the brake line.

16:17.920 --> 16:20.190
But I'm not a mechanic.
I didn't know what was what.

16:20.240 --> 16:21.310
METAL CLANGS

16:21.360 --> 16:23.990
Then when I heard someone coming,
I ran off.

16:24.040 --> 16:27.120
When I got home, I realised I still
had the cable cutters in my hand

16:28.720 --> 16:30.230
So I hid them away.

16:30.280 --> 16:33.150
An unfortunate set of circumstances
which does rather have the

16:33.200 --> 16:36.630
effect of making you look
extremely guilty.

16:36.680 --> 16:38.430
I am guilty.

16:38.480 --> 16:41.800
I wanted her dead...
and now I'm going to hang for it.

16:44.520 --> 16:47.440
And I'll be down there,
while my husband...

16:50.000 --> 16:51.640
For all eternity.

16:54.680 --> 16:56.120
That's right, isn't it? No.

16:58.080 --> 17:00.240
Not if you ask for God's
forgiveness.

17:02.280 --> 17:03.560
And besides...

17:05.960 --> 17:09.829
..it's highly likely the person you
heard...

17:09.880 --> 17:10.960
was the real culprit.

17:12.720 --> 17:14.829
I told the inspector there was
someone else there,

17:14.880 --> 17:16.400
but he doesn't believe me.

17:17.960 --> 17:19.280
Between you and me...

17:20.680 --> 17:22.680
..I'm going to investigate.

17:35.040 --> 17:36.240
Morning.

17:42.960 --> 17:45.000
BREATHLESS: My bicycle tyre needs
a pump.

17:47.640 --> 17:49.120
Thank you, you're a life-saver.

17:50.680 --> 17:51.960
No problem.

17:54.640 --> 17:56.080
Horrible business yesterday.

17:57.440 --> 17:58.680
How are you coping?

18:00.120 --> 18:03.080
Excuse me? You and Audrey MacMurray,
you were close, weren't you?

18:05.200 --> 18:09.190
Is that a question or statement?
More of a statement really.

18:09.240 --> 18:11.430
A friend of mine
said you walked in on him

18:11.480 --> 18:12.520
and Audrey at...

18:13.840 --> 18:15.590
..rather an
inopportune moment,

18:15.640 --> 18:18.200
shall we say?
And that you seemed very upset.

18:20.640 --> 18:21.800
You can leave now.

18:23.560 --> 18:26.870
If Mrs Welsby is convicted,
she could hang.

18:26.920 --> 18:29.510
That's for the courts to decide.
I believe she's innocent.

18:29.560 --> 18:32.790
Huh, and I'm not?
If you know anything at all,
you owe it to your conscience...

18:32.840 --> 18:36.030
Like I told the police, I didn't
have anything to do with it.

18:36.080 --> 18:37.600
Harriet Welsby's life is at stake.

18:38.840 --> 18:42.280
Then say a prayer for her,
Father, but keep away from me.

19:06.640 --> 19:08.840
FATHER BROWN READS
SCRIPTURE IN LATIN

19:21.840 --> 19:24.670
Requiem aeternam dona ei, Domine.

19:24.720 --> 19:27.000
ALL: Et lux perpetua luceat ei.

19:42.880 --> 19:44.680
CROWS CAW

19:47.160 --> 19:48.680
Requiescat in pace.

19:49.800 --> 19:51.520
ALL: Amen.

19:53.360 --> 19:54.910
I'd like to say a few words.

19:54.960 --> 19:56.710
That would not be appropriate.

19:56.760 --> 19:57.760
Sorry, Father.

19:59.000 --> 20:01.400
"Appropriate" never was my
strong point.

20:05.320 --> 20:09.470
Audrey MacMurray...
was a cruel woman. Oh!

20:09.520 --> 20:12.120
We all know that.
Let's not pretend she wasn't.

20:13.760 --> 20:16.510
It isn't being respectful of the
dead lying about them, is it?

20:16.560 --> 20:18.790
He is drunk.
Mr Bakewell...

20:18.840 --> 20:21.240
She chewed people up
and she spat them out!

20:23.320 --> 20:24.990
And she enjoyed doing it.

20:25.040 --> 20:26.990
Tearing the flesh off their bones.

20:27.040 --> 20:29.680
Eating people's hearts
for breakfast. My heart!

20:33.320 --> 20:35.310
We were lovers.

20:35.360 --> 20:39.120
Not that she knew what love was.
Or how to care about other people.

20:44.920 --> 20:47.240
I can't be like that. I won't be.

20:49.840 --> 20:53.080
And I won't let somebody else
pay for what I've done.

21:00.520 --> 21:02.320
It was me.

21:04.560 --> 21:06.110
I killed her.

21:06.160 --> 21:07.400
GASPS

21:12.080 --> 21:13.680
I'm sorry.

21:16.480 --> 21:18.070
HE SIGHS

21:18.120 --> 21:21.550
Sergeant, would you please take
Mr Bakewell to the cells?

21:21.600 --> 21:23.510
You'll hang for this!

21:23.560 --> 21:25.870
Mr MacMurray,
you've given your witness statement.

21:25.920 --> 21:27.070
Now please go home.

21:27.120 --> 21:28.390
You do have the awful business

21:28.440 --> 21:30.640
of your wife's affairs
to attend to, Mr MacMurray.

21:38.920 --> 21:40.830
How about a nice cup of tea?

21:40.880 --> 21:42.590
How about a stiff drink?

21:42.640 --> 21:46.270
Mrs McCarthy, why don't you take
Harriet to the presbytery?

21:46.320 --> 21:48.640
There's a bottle
of Bordeaux in my study.

21:49.800 --> 21:52.070
Is there indeed? Hmph.

21:52.120 --> 21:53.360
Right.

22:00.360 --> 22:01.400
Inspector?

22:02.880 --> 22:06.430
Inspector, I don't suppose you've
managed to identify

22:06.480 --> 22:07.990
the origin of the fabric...

22:08.040 --> 22:13.030
An anomaly, probably...
detritus at the scene that got

22:13.080 --> 22:15.670
snagged as she was
thrown from the car.

22:15.720 --> 22:18.950
But... Father, I have motive,
means, and opportunity -

22:19.000 --> 22:20.230
and a confession.

22:20.280 --> 22:22.760
Whether you like it or not,
this case is now closed.

22:36.640 --> 22:38.830
(This has got way out of hand.)

22:38.880 --> 22:40.790
(I'm not happy with this.)

22:40.840 --> 22:42.360
THEY TALK IN HUSHED TONES

22:55.800 --> 22:57.120
COCK CROWS

23:14.880 --> 23:17.670
Thank you for expediting
the paperwork, Mr Watts.

23:17.720 --> 23:19.160
No at all, Miss Stanwyck.

23:55.800 --> 23:57.200
SHE MOANS

24:07.560 --> 24:09.870
What in blazes do you think
you're doing?!

24:09.920 --> 24:12.000
Isn't that obvious? Filthy priest.

24:13.600 --> 24:15.710
You're having an affair.
I don't know

24:15.760 --> 24:18.310
what you THINK you saw, but
you're mistaken.

24:18.360 --> 24:20.510
I know lust when I see it.
How dare you?!

24:20.560 --> 24:24.750
You had motive, opportunity...
the only question is means.

24:24.800 --> 24:26.510
What are you suggesting?

24:26.560 --> 24:29.030
That somehow you caused the
accident. You're delusional.

24:29.080 --> 24:32.350
Why don't we let the police decide?
Call them.

24:32.400 --> 24:35.800
He was trespassing on private
property. Spying through the window.

24:37.680 --> 24:39.640
Do it. Yes, do it.

24:55.200 --> 24:56.870
What's this about?

24:56.920 --> 24:59.830
HE was trespassing.
Snooping through the window,

24:59.880 --> 25:01.750
making baseless accusations.

25:01.800 --> 25:03.520
Horrid accusations. Horrid!

25:11.760 --> 25:13.750
It's an act.
What exactly did you see?

25:13.800 --> 25:16.520
She was...straddling him.
Straddling?

25:17.760 --> 25:20.030
Don't really want to demonstrate.

25:20.080 --> 25:21.990
So they've been having an affair?
Exactly.

25:22.040 --> 25:24.630
And you think that makes them
responsible... Yes, I do.

25:24.680 --> 25:27.150
Evidence? Nothing yet.

25:27.200 --> 25:29.070
But if I know
anything, its human behaviour,

25:29.120 --> 25:30.720
and theirs speaks volumes.

25:31.960 --> 25:35.350
An interesting theory.
Hands, please.

25:35.400 --> 25:39.510
Don't understand. It's quite simple.
I'm arresting you.

25:39.560 --> 25:43.920
Oh, I see. For show?
No, for breach of the peace.

25:45.000 --> 25:48.630
I've warned you time and time again,
but you don't listen.

25:48.680 --> 25:50.680
Turn around. Hands - now.

25:53.120 --> 25:57.470
Father Brown, I am arresting
you for breach of the peace.

25:57.520 --> 26:00.790
You are not obliged to say anything
unless you wish to do so,

26:00.840 --> 26:02.830
but what you say will be put
into writing

26:02.880 --> 26:04.400
and may be given in evidence.

26:19.960 --> 26:22.190
Phyllis
and Walter killed Audrey MacMurray.

26:22.240 --> 26:25.870
Even if they are having an affair,
that doesn't make them murderers.

26:25.920 --> 26:28.510
What's this?
None of your concern. Get down.

26:28.560 --> 26:32.430
On the contrary, I'd say it was
of Mr Bakewell's gravest concern.

26:32.480 --> 26:35.870
Don't you see?
It's all starting to add up -

26:35.920 --> 26:39.430
the relationship, the inheritance,
the anomalous piece of fabric...

26:39.480 --> 26:43.070
ENOUGH! My God, man, you have been a
thorn in my side

26:43.120 --> 26:45.950
ever since I stepped into this
piddling little parish.

26:46.000 --> 26:47.990
Sticking your head in where
it's not wanted,

26:48.040 --> 26:50.350
trampling all over
my investigations.

26:50.400 --> 26:52.670
I want you to know that
I fully intend to go through with

26:52.720 --> 26:55.920
these charges, to finally put a stop
to your amateur sleuthing.

27:07.480 --> 27:09.510
To the perfect murder.

27:09.560 --> 27:11.560
Hmm. And the perfect woman.

27:26.680 --> 27:29.390
He must've put something on the
course when he ran the safety car,

27:29.440 --> 27:30.870
something that caused the crash.

27:30.920 --> 27:34.520
No. Miss Stanwyck wouldn't have
left anything like that to chance.

27:35.760 --> 27:37.470
And anyway, they would have
discovered

27:37.520 --> 27:39.600
a hazard after the accident.
What then?

27:41.400 --> 27:43.990
What happened when you
walked in on Sid and Audrey?

27:44.040 --> 27:45.320
She fired me.

27:48.640 --> 27:53.840
Afterwards, I went back to the
paddock to fetch me tool box.

27:54.880 --> 27:56.750
I saw that woman. Harriet.

27:56.800 --> 27:58.960
METAL CLANGS
Trying to find the brake line.

28:00.240 --> 28:03.600
When she ran off...
I finished what she started.

28:21.640 --> 28:24.470
Have you any idea how Audrey could
have got a piece of fabric

28:24.520 --> 28:26.080
trapped under her bracelet?

28:27.360 --> 28:28.680
She wasn't wearing it.

28:30.680 --> 28:32.630
What?

28:32.680 --> 28:34.670
I bought her that bracelet.

28:34.720 --> 28:36.320
She wasn't wearing
it before she ran.

28:37.320 --> 28:39.120
SPECTATOR: Go, Mrs MacMurray!

28:43.320 --> 28:45.320
Sergeant! What is it?

28:46.360 --> 28:47.920
I'm entitled to a phone call.

28:49.240 --> 28:50.760
PHONE RINGS

28:53.960 --> 28:55.880
I have come to visit Father Brown.

28:56.920 --> 28:58.400
What's that?

29:04.560 --> 29:07.120
To sustain him
in his unjust incarceration.

29:08.920 --> 29:12.000
Oh, what do you suppose I've
hidden in there? A hacksaw?

29:13.400 --> 29:16.550
Oh, well go ahead - check it out!

29:16.600 --> 29:18.920
Slice it, why don't you?!
I will.

29:37.640 --> 29:39.040
Ah.

29:46.000 --> 29:47.880
That is no way to slice a cake!

29:49.160 --> 29:51.070
Oh...

29:51.120 --> 29:52.560
Apologies.

29:55.400 --> 29:59.670
I had better go back home
straightaway and bake another one.

29:59.720 --> 30:02.120
Sorry to be a bother.

30:31.920 --> 30:33.630
DOOR CREAKS

30:33.680 --> 30:35.790
(Could you make a little
less noise?)

30:35.840 --> 30:38.760
Not unless you've got an oil can
under your cassock.

30:45.760 --> 30:48.230
Longing for your glory days?

30:48.280 --> 30:50.280
That grease monkey was
right about one thing.

30:51.760 --> 30:53.400
She didn't care about other people.

30:55.120 --> 30:57.310
I was just another trophy.

30:57.360 --> 31:01.750
Huh. They must have thought
I was an idiot.

31:01.800 --> 31:03.750
AS IF I didn't know
they were at it.

31:03.800 --> 31:07.030
Don't be maudlin, darling.
You finally got your revenge.

31:07.080 --> 31:08.310
Be happy.

31:08.360 --> 31:11.470
Besides, we should be grateful to
that grease monkey -

31:11.520 --> 31:14.230
fortuitously framing
himself for our crime.

31:14.280 --> 31:15.320
Bless his heart.

31:18.040 --> 31:21.110
You're wearing her dress.
Well, why not?

31:21.160 --> 31:22.440
What's hers is mine now.

31:23.480 --> 31:27.550
I was thinking,
once the paperwork's been finalised,

31:27.600 --> 31:29.360
why not make me a joint shareholder?

31:30.360 --> 31:33.550
You have to admit, I've got more
of a head for business than you do.

31:33.600 --> 31:36.750
I thought we were going to leave,
start a new life?

31:36.800 --> 31:39.840
Why leave when we have everything
we need right here?

31:42.880 --> 31:44.600
Did you leave the garage door open?

31:51.360 --> 31:53.590
What you think you're going to
find in there?

31:53.640 --> 31:56.280
Something resembling proof.

31:58.960 --> 32:00.710
That looks like blood.

32:00.760 --> 32:03.070
So she was killed inside the car?

32:03.120 --> 32:04.160
Not quite.

32:06.200 --> 32:07.630
A-ha! What?

32:07.680 --> 32:09.920
The final piece of the puzzle.

32:12.520 --> 32:14.870
I think this fabric is the same
fabric

32:14.920 --> 32:18.070
that was snagged under
Audrey's bracelet.

32:18.120 --> 32:20.400
And I'll be happy to call
the police for you this time.

32:21.720 --> 32:23.280
Let's go in the house, shall we?

32:35.600 --> 32:37.870
What's going on here?
Mrs McCarthy.

32:37.920 --> 32:39.590
Comes in with
a cake for Father Brown,

32:39.640 --> 32:42.720
knocks it all over the place,
then leaves without even seeing him.

32:51.240 --> 32:52.440
Where did he go?

32:56.640 --> 32:57.800
Where did he go?!

33:05.000 --> 33:07.230
You two will be on the run
for the rest of your lives.

33:07.280 --> 33:09.160
What exactly do you think you know?

33:11.560 --> 33:13.870
Well...

33:13.920 --> 33:16.910
I know enough to prove you
killed Mrs MacMurray

33:16.960 --> 33:19.590
before the race. Somewhere private.

33:19.640 --> 33:21.870
Somewhere where no-one could
see you.

33:21.920 --> 33:23.600
How does he know that we...?
Be quiet.

33:25.480 --> 33:27.950
Harriet saw you calling
her into the office.

33:28.000 --> 33:31.320
Mrs MacMurray? It's Mr Baxter.
Coming.

33:33.640 --> 33:35.550
That's where it happened, wasn't it?

33:35.600 --> 33:37.230
That's where you fractured her
skull.

33:37.280 --> 33:38.830
Phyllis! Can't you deal with
this?

33:38.880 --> 33:43.070
He wants to talk to you.
Oh, honestly... Mr Baxter?

33:43.120 --> 33:45.030
LINE GOES DEAD
Hello?

33:45.080 --> 33:46.190
Mr Baxter?

33:46.240 --> 33:47.440
Urgh!

33:51.440 --> 33:52.840
PHONE BUZZES

33:57.520 --> 33:59.310
Go on.

33:59.360 --> 34:01.440
The next part of the plan was
relatively simple.

34:10.120 --> 34:12.280
You dumped the body in the car...

34:15.719 --> 34:17.960
..and then YOU
changed into identical clothes

34:28.400 --> 34:29.840
And you drove up the hill.

34:31.520 --> 34:34.389
And when you got to the blind
bend...

34:34.440 --> 34:36.040
you positioned the body.

34:51.080 --> 34:52.429
But...

34:52.480 --> 34:54.750
you didn't notice that
Audrey's bracelet had

34:54.800 --> 34:56.840
caught on the material
at the back of the car.

34:59.480 --> 35:04.640
So, the scene being set, all that
was left was to run the race.

35:13.040 --> 35:14.600
Good luck, darling.

35:16.200 --> 35:18.550
But, of course, you had no idea

35:18.600 --> 35:21.520
that an attempt had already been
made on Audrey's life.

35:23.480 --> 35:27.990
And your plan to feign an accident
very nearly was thwarted

35:28.040 --> 35:29.960
when you genuinely lost control.

35:47.080 --> 35:49.670
That's when you injured your arm,
wasn't it?

35:49.720 --> 35:52.190
Your later slip down the ditch...

35:52.240 --> 35:55.870
That was just another sham to cover
up your injury.

35:55.920 --> 35:58.470
Be careful, madam! Oh!

35:58.520 --> 35:59.550
What happened?

35:59.600 --> 36:01.160
An audacious plan, I'll admit.

36:02.960 --> 36:05.190
But ultimately...

36:05.240 --> 36:06.840
as foul as any other murder.

36:08.320 --> 36:10.190
Not so cocky now, are ya?

36:10.240 --> 36:13.750
We're done for! Be quiet. What are
we going to do?!

36:13.800 --> 36:15.320
There's only one thing left to do.

36:16.640 --> 36:19.350
Wait! There has to be another way.

36:19.400 --> 36:21.470
Prison - is that what you'd prefer?

36:21.520 --> 36:24.030
We can lock them up here.
Make our escape.

36:24.080 --> 36:25.870
Start our new lives like we
always planned.

36:25.920 --> 36:28.710
That's your answer, is it?
To run away?

36:28.760 --> 36:30.400
Pathetic. Just go with them.

36:32.040 --> 36:33.240
What? Go!

36:37.640 --> 36:40.590
Should've known you wouldn't rise
to the occasion. Feeble little man.

36:40.640 --> 36:42.560
She's been using you all along,
mate.

36:44.400 --> 36:47.720
That's the way the world works,
sweetheart. Everyone uses everyone.

36:48.840 --> 36:52.630
I find it heartbreaking that that's
how you see the world.

36:52.680 --> 36:55.430
I'm touched by your attempt to
empathise.

36:55.480 --> 36:58.710
Even if it is motivated by a desire
to see me lower the gun.

36:58.760 --> 37:00.720
Alas, needs must

37:01.960 --> 37:03.200
Goodbye, Father.

37:04.640 --> 37:06.280
Ugh!
SHE GASPS

37:09.200 --> 37:10.800
SID GROANS IN PAIN

37:12.960 --> 37:14.470
You all right?

37:14.520 --> 37:17.040
HOARSE: They've seen better days.
Agh...

37:24.840 --> 37:26.200
Walter!

37:28.000 --> 37:29.880
Phyllis! Stop.

37:37.240 --> 37:41.790
It's not too late for us, Walter. We
can still leave together.

37:41.840 --> 37:44.440
Don't! Just...don't.

37:46.560 --> 37:49.040
Walter, why don't you give me
the gun?

37:51.280 --> 37:53.960
You never loved me.
Ah, the penny drops!

37:55.200 --> 37:59.600
It was all an act.
Of course I loved you. I still do.

38:01.160 --> 38:03.480
I just got scared. It made me crazy.

38:05.240 --> 38:07.120
I'll make it up to you, I promise.

38:09.200 --> 38:11.430
Let's go
while we still have the chance.

38:11.480 --> 38:12.830
Don't come any closer!

38:12.880 --> 38:15.830
If you let them arrest me,
I could hang.

38:15.880 --> 38:18.150
You'll be killing me either way.
Is that what you want?

38:18.200 --> 38:19.520
It's what you deserve.

38:21.240 --> 38:23.440
Walter.

38:25.080 --> 38:26.240
You're not a killer.

38:27.720 --> 38:28.960
Forgive me, Father.

38:30.440 --> 38:33.070
If you do this, you'll regret it.

38:33.120 --> 38:34.280
(Listen to him.)

38:35.880 --> 38:38.080
Just like you regret
killing your wife.

38:40.640 --> 38:43.280
I saw your face...
through the window.

38:45.200 --> 38:46.800
That was remorse, wasn't it?

38:49.400 --> 38:50.440
Wasn't it?

38:55.280 --> 38:56.600
Save yourself, Walter.

39:10.520 --> 39:12.040
We'll get what we deserve.

39:13.760 --> 39:18.070
You think this is justice?
It's subjugation.

39:18.120 --> 39:19.830
You're terrified of any woman who

39:19.880 --> 39:22.830
dares to be more than a meek little
housewife.

39:22.880 --> 39:24.630
That's why you wanted her dead.

39:24.680 --> 39:27.640
So you could reassert
your pathetic masculinity.

39:31.880 --> 39:33.840
Inspector, thank God you're here!

39:34.920 --> 39:36.240
He was going to kill me.

39:42.120 --> 39:45.110
This is the way to raise
money for charity -

39:45.160 --> 39:48.070
no noise,
no cars and no grisly deaths.

39:48.120 --> 39:49.280
So far.

39:51.800 --> 39:54.710
Mmm, these buns are delicious,
Harriet. Thank you, Father.

39:54.760 --> 39:58.230
I dare say you could give
Mrs McCarthy a run for her money.

39:58.280 --> 40:01.350
Father Brown, Mrs McCarthy.
I couldn't resist the opportunity

40:01.400 --> 40:03.550
to try my hand at gourmet
baking.

40:03.600 --> 40:05.070
Gourmet?

40:05.120 --> 40:07.990
Gateaux Parisiens
and a chiffon torte citron.

40:08.040 --> 40:10.880
Otherwise known as "French cake"
or "Lemon tart".

40:12.000 --> 40:14.950
And you baked these yourself, did
you? Scout's honour.

40:15.000 --> 40:17.070
A likely story.

40:17.120 --> 40:19.550
Inspector, bite of something sweet?

40:19.600 --> 40:21.190
Thank you, but I'm not staying.

40:21.240 --> 40:23.720
Just came to see the Father.
In private.

40:27.320 --> 40:28.360
Excuse me.

40:30.600 --> 40:33.750
You'll be glad to know that
Mr Bakewell's charge has been

40:33.800 --> 40:35.240
downgraded to attempted murder.

40:37.240 --> 40:42.070
The..."actress", Miss Stanwyck,
is going down for murder.

40:42.120 --> 40:44.790
And her partner in crime,
conspiracy.

40:44.840 --> 40:46.040
And what about me?

40:47.440 --> 40:49.790
Have you come to put
the cuffs on me again?

40:49.840 --> 40:50.960
Alas, not.

40:52.080 --> 40:54.280
All charges have been dropped, and...

40:55.560 --> 40:56.800
And what?

40:58.960 --> 41:01.470
The pro sols were so impressed
with your help in solving

41:01.520 --> 41:05.280
the case they passed on the
information to my senior officers.

41:06.400 --> 41:07.440
And?

41:09.480 --> 41:13.120
They've awarded you this for your
help in assisting the police.

41:24.360 --> 41:27.440
Oh, congratulations!
And about time too.

41:28.680 --> 41:33.510
So, I suppose this makes me
your deputy...

41:33.560 --> 41:35.630
sheriff?

41:35.680 --> 41:36.800
Don't push it.
