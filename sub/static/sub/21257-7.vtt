00:07.233 --> 00:11.100
("Pomp and Circumstance"
playing)

00:11.133 --> 00:13.967
Cole, this campus,
it's beautiful!

00:14.000 --> 00:18.367
Yeah, grass, bricks, nerds,
tight, tight, tight, let's go.

00:18.400 --> 00:20.000
You need to take
this seriously.

00:20.033 --> 00:21.000
How do you expect
to make a living

00:21.033 --> 00:22.467
without a college degree?

00:22.500 --> 00:25.833
Come on, Ma, you know I'm full
of "Shark Tank" caliber ideas.

00:25.867 --> 00:27.533
A pipe that lights itself.

00:27.567 --> 00:29.967
Google Glasses,
but they're sunglasses.

00:30.000 --> 00:33.000
A period tracking app
but for men.

00:33.033 --> 00:34.167
Honey, I have always said

00:34.200 --> 00:36.367
you will make an
incredible entrepreneur.

00:36.400 --> 00:37.833
I prefer chillventor.

00:37.867 --> 00:39.067
But first you
need a degree.

00:39.100 --> 00:41.667
Now, wait here
while I get a map.

00:41.700 --> 00:44.800
Fam, none of the greatest
minds got a degree.

00:44.833 --> 00:46.967
Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg.

00:47.000 --> 00:49.233
Lil Yachty,
they all dropped out.

00:49.267 --> 00:50.933
Don't need
to go to college.

00:50.967 --> 00:52.700
So, on your right,
you'll see a dorm,

00:52.733 --> 00:55.367
unfortunately named after
a former slaveholder.

00:55.400 --> 00:56.967
And on your left,
you'll see someone

00:57.000 --> 00:58.900
who is totally wrong
about college.

00:58.933 --> 00:59.867
Hi, Cole.

00:59.900 --> 01:01.267
I'm here to set
you straight.

01:01.300 --> 01:03.200
What, are you recruiting
for an acapella group?

01:03.233 --> 01:04.900
Oh, no, I wish
I was that cool.

01:04.933 --> 01:08.133
I'm Adam Conover, and this
is "Adam Ruins Everything."

You're the nerd
from the YouTube ads

01:20.033 --> 01:22.400
they play before
fail compilations.

01:22.433 --> 01:25.133
Are you gonna ruin college?
That's sick!

01:25.167 --> 01:27.567
I bet you're gonna break down
why college is a waste of time.

01:27.600 --> 01:29.733
And everyone should
drop out and and get rich.

01:29.767 --> 01:31.400
My dude!

01:31.433 --> 01:33.100
I hate to turn down
a bro hug, Cole,

01:33.133 --> 01:34.367
but I'm gonna
disappoint you.

01:34.400 --> 01:37.400
In the 21st century, if you
wanna earn a decent living,

01:37.433 --> 01:39.700
you pretty much
have to go to college.

01:39.733 --> 01:41.567
What? You sound
like a parent.

01:41.600 --> 01:42.733
I thought you were cool!

01:42.767 --> 01:44.700
Oh, no, I am
definitely not that.

01:44.733 --> 01:45.833
And it's the truth.

01:45.867 --> 01:47.633
The truth isn't
always cool.

01:47.667 --> 01:48.600
Whatever.

01:48.633 --> 01:49.933
I'm gonna be
like Bill Gates.

01:49.967 --> 01:52.200
He dropped out of college
and made bazillions.

01:52.233 --> 01:54.900
Ah, yes, the famous
Bill Gates myth.

01:54.933 --> 01:56.600
Everyone uses him
as an example

01:56.633 --> 01:58.833
of why no one needs
to go to college,

01:58.867 --> 02:02.900
as though Bill were just some
everyman who had one great idea.

02:02.933 --> 02:06.333
Wow, look at all
these windows.

02:06.367 --> 02:08.033
I've got an idea.

02:08.067 --> 02:09.733
Microsoft Word.

02:09.767 --> 02:13.600
* Money, money...
(laughing)

02:13.633 --> 02:17.133
Right, that's exactly what I
wanna do with my Micro Cooler.

02:17.167 --> 02:19.433
It's a microwave
that cools things.

02:19.467 --> 02:21.767
Okay, you know that's
called a freezer, right?

02:21.800 --> 02:23.467
And secondly,
the only reason Bill Gates

02:23.500 --> 02:25.600
was able to succeed
without a college degree

02:25.633 --> 02:28.100
is that he was a freakishly
hard-working genius

02:28.133 --> 02:31.133
who had advantages
almost no one else does.

02:31.167 --> 02:32.733
Before Gates
even went to college,

02:32.767 --> 02:35.567
his parents enrolled him in an
expensive private high school

02:35.600 --> 02:38.500
that just happened to have
a state-of-the-art computer

02:38.533 --> 02:41.433
no other kid
would have access to.

02:41.467 --> 02:42.733
Whoa, he's,
like "Whiplash"

02:42.767 --> 02:44.800
except his
"Whiplash" is computers.

02:44.833 --> 02:46.933
Before he dropped out,
Gates already had

02:46.967 --> 02:48.900
thousands of hours
of programming experience

02:48.933 --> 02:51.200
and was already
an expert.

02:51.233 --> 02:53.367
Welcome to Programming 101.

02:53.400 --> 02:54.500
For our first assignment--

02:54.533 --> 02:56.333
Did it already,
plus the next ten.

02:56.367 --> 02:58.200
Do I pass?

02:58.233 --> 03:00.700
And before he left Harvard,
Gates and his partner

03:00.733 --> 03:02.567
had already founded Microsoft

03:02.600 --> 03:06.167
and made the first software
that ran on personal computers.

03:06.200 --> 03:09.867
So, for him, dropping out wasn't
that really much of a risk.

03:09.900 --> 03:12.200
And I never even
officially dropped out.

03:12.233 --> 03:13.833
If I failed,
I could've always gone back

03:13.867 --> 03:16.467
to my Ivy League education
on my parent's dime.

03:18.900 --> 03:21.700
The fact is Bill Gates's
dropout story just isn't one

03:21.733 --> 03:23.233
that most people
can emulate.

03:23.267 --> 03:25.467
Because almost no one
is that accomplished,

03:25.500 --> 03:27.533
gifted and just
plain lucky.

03:27.567 --> 03:29.067
Are you?

03:29.100 --> 03:31.800
Well... in my case, I did get
a bunch of kids in my school

03:31.833 --> 03:33.533
to start saying
the word "select."

03:33.567 --> 03:35.667
You know, like,
"Those shoes are select!"

03:35.700 --> 03:38.200
Or, "That party had
me feeling select!"

03:38.233 --> 03:41.067
So, in that way,
I'm kind of like Bill Gates.

03:41.100 --> 03:42.400
Whatever, dude.
What about all the other

03:42.433 --> 03:44.667
awesome dropouts,
like, Mark Zuckerberg

03:44.700 --> 03:46.467
or Carmelo Anthony and...

03:46.500 --> 03:47.833
Or Jeffrey Dahmer?

03:47.867 --> 03:51.700
I dropped out of college
and I'm doing okay.

03:51.733 --> 03:53.867
I eat well every night.

03:56.267 --> 03:58.767
Oh, darn.

03:58.800 --> 04:01.667
When you focus only on the
famous success stories,

04:01.700 --> 04:03.667
but ignore the lesser
known failures,

04:03.700 --> 04:07.667
you're committing a logical
error known as survivor bias.

04:07.700 --> 04:11.433
For every tech billionaire
dropout the media obsesses over,

04:11.467 --> 04:13.900
there are countless
less fortunate folks

04:13.933 --> 04:15.867
whose stories
you never hear.

04:15.900 --> 04:18.967
But if you did, they might
sound something like this.

04:19.000 --> 04:21.733
Yeah, dude, I thought I was
gonna be Zuckerberg, too.

04:21.767 --> 04:23.200
I was wrong.

04:23.233 --> 04:26.400
College dropouts are 71%
more likely to be unemployed.

04:26.433 --> 04:29.067
No...
You guys are just lazy.

04:29.100 --> 04:30.800
I'm driven,
I know I'd get a job.

04:30.833 --> 04:33.133
Yeah, maybe, but you're
not gonna get rich.

04:33.167 --> 04:34.833
College grads make more
than high school grads

04:34.867 --> 04:37.033
at every point
of their careers.

04:40.733 --> 04:41.700
What?

04:41.733 --> 04:43.400
Why are you
guys even recruiting?

04:43.433 --> 04:45.000
Something to do,
I guess.

04:47.000 --> 04:48.633
Those numbers are crazy.

04:48.667 --> 04:50.033
But my dad doesn't
have a degree.

04:50.067 --> 04:51.733
He did fine.
So what changed?

04:51.767 --> 04:52.967
Our economy.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.833
Over the past few decades,
getting a middle class job

04:55.867 --> 04:59.300
without a college degree
has become way more difficult.

04:59.333 --> 05:02.567
Since 1985, on average,
the US has lost over

05:02.600 --> 05:07.100
300,000 manufacturing
jobs per year.

05:07.133 --> 05:08.233
Whoa, I think that's
more than, like,

05:08.267 --> 05:10.233
Steve Aoki's Instagram
followers.

05:10.267 --> 05:13.333
And at the same time, we've
gained jobs in skilled fields.

05:13.367 --> 05:18.533
In the last 20 years, software
jobs have gone up by over 500%.

05:18.567 --> 05:20.167
And in the past decade,

05:20.200 --> 05:23.600
Internet jobs have
increased by 600%.

05:23.633 --> 05:26.733
And those jobs require
a college education.

05:26.767 --> 05:28.533
In the six years
since the great recession,

05:28.567 --> 05:31.600
less than one percent of jobs
created have gone to those

05:31.633 --> 05:33.667
with a high school diploma
or less.

05:33.700 --> 05:35.200
Whoa, that's it?
Yeah.

05:35.233 --> 05:36.967
That's why even
Bill Gates himself

05:37.000 --> 05:39.333
says more Americans
need to go to college.

05:55.500 --> 05:57.467
Really?
Bill Gates said that?

05:57.500 --> 05:59.800
Yup, the truth is
a college education

05:59.833 --> 06:03.167
is a virtual necessity to
compete in today's economy.

06:03.200 --> 06:04.333
That's why
it's such a shame

06:04.367 --> 06:06.733
that so many people
can't afford one.

06:06.767 --> 06:09.867
Oh, I never thought I'd say
this but my mom was right!

06:09.900 --> 06:12.767
If I ever wanna be rich,
I need to go to college.

06:12.800 --> 06:13.900
What else was
she right about?

06:13.933 --> 06:15.533
Maybe Celine Dion
is good!

06:15.567 --> 06:17.000
Is that a kind of mustard?

06:17.033 --> 06:19.900
But if I'm going to college,
it's gotta be the best college.

06:19.933 --> 06:23.500
Hey, you!
Is this place
select or not?!

06:23.533 --> 06:26.200
I know, I'll get one of those
magazines that ranks colleges.

06:26.233 --> 06:28.633
That's tell me which
is icy and which is dicey.

06:28.667 --> 06:30.033
(laughing)

06:30.067 --> 06:32.500
Uh, those rankings
are pretty arbitrary.

06:32.533 --> 06:33.800
Let me tell you about it!

06:33.833 --> 06:35.767
(Cole's mom)
Cole?!

06:35.800 --> 06:37.867
Cole?!

06:37.900 --> 06:39.400
Where'd you go?

06:39.433 --> 06:40.433
Cole!

06:44.133 --> 06:45.633
**

06:45.667 --> 06:48.867
Oh, perfect, "US News
and World Report."

06:48.900 --> 06:51.400
They rank every school
in the things that matter most.

06:51.433 --> 06:53.633
Smartness,
how many books they got.

06:53.667 --> 06:57.033
Which school's colors match
my dopest Flyknits.

06:57.067 --> 06:58.333
(Adam)
No, they don't.

06:58.367 --> 07:00.833
"US News and World Report's"
ranking may be popular.

07:00.867 --> 07:03.433
But they've rewarded
schools that lie, cheat

07:03.467 --> 07:05.067
and manipulate the system.

07:05.100 --> 07:07.700
Oh! Ahh!

07:07.733 --> 07:09.667
But I thought it was created
by scientists or whatever.

07:09.700 --> 07:13.767
Nope, in fact when "US News"
created these rankings in 1983,

07:13.800 --> 07:16.367
they were basically
a popularity contest.

07:16.400 --> 07:18.533
They would just ask
college presidents

07:18.567 --> 07:20.267
what they thought
of each other's schools.

07:20.300 --> 07:23.467
Get this, Harvard told me
that Yale told them that they

07:23.500 --> 07:26.600
heard Princeton say Brown's
MBA program is super basic.

07:26.633 --> 07:28.400
Oh, I love gossip.

07:28.433 --> 07:30.700
But this opened them up
to criticism.

07:30.733 --> 07:32.233
You're being
so rude.

07:32.267 --> 07:33.600
Princeton doesn't
even know me.

07:33.633 --> 07:35.800
They're haters,
and you're a hater!

07:35.833 --> 07:37.033
Unfriend.

07:37.067 --> 07:38.300
No, don't unfriend me.

07:38.333 --> 07:39.700
I can change!

07:39.733 --> 07:41.300
And change they did.

07:41.333 --> 07:44.433
Starting in 1988, "US News"
reworked their ranking system

07:44.467 --> 07:47.833
into a complicated formula.

07:47.867 --> 07:49.933
(Cole)
Numbers, percentage signs.

07:49.967 --> 07:51.400
Looks like some
legit science.

07:51.433 --> 07:52.733
Uh, it's not.

07:52.767 --> 07:55.400
We weight these categories
however we want.

07:55.433 --> 07:57.267
It's subjective.
Check it out.

07:57.300 --> 08:00.700
This year, alumni giving
is gonna be...

08:00.733 --> 08:02.733
69 percent.

08:02.767 --> 08:04.267
(chuckles)

08:04.300 --> 08:06.067
Uh, that's too silly
even for me.

08:06.100 --> 08:07.967
So, this pseudo
scientific system

08:08.000 --> 08:09.967
became incredibly powerful.

08:10.000 --> 08:11.567
Now when a school
slips in the rankings,

08:11.600 --> 08:13.833
it can affect the number of
applications they receive,

08:13.867 --> 08:18.600
their research funding, even the
all-important alumni donations.

08:18.633 --> 08:20.900
We dropped two places?!

08:20.933 --> 08:25.300
I'm taking my check
and my name back.

08:25.333 --> 08:28.567
Enjoy your lame bookstore,
failures!

08:28.600 --> 08:31.133
Because of this, schools
are under intense pressure

08:31.167 --> 08:32.867
to keep their ranking up.

08:32.900 --> 08:34.000
And that's good, right?

08:34.033 --> 08:35.133
It's a free market.

08:35.167 --> 08:36.467
It forces schools
to be better.

08:36.500 --> 08:38.833
Nope, it forces
them to seem better.

08:38.867 --> 08:41.933
And for some schools,
that even means they'll lie.

08:41.967 --> 08:44.067
**

08:44.100 --> 08:46.767
At Claremont McKenna,
a senior officer

08:46.800 --> 08:50.367
lied about our SAT
scores for six years.

08:50.400 --> 08:53.233
At Clemson, we gave other
schools low ratings

08:53.267 --> 08:55.333
to make ourselves look better.

08:55.367 --> 08:58.433
At Iona College,
we lied about multiple

08:58.467 --> 09:01.367
categories on the
survey for nine years.

09:01.400 --> 09:02.567
(laughing)

09:02.600 --> 09:03.867
And it worked.

09:03.900 --> 09:06.033
If they hadn't lied,
Iona would've been 20 spots

09:06.067 --> 09:07.133
lower in the rankings.

09:07.167 --> 09:08.300
Lame.

09:08.333 --> 09:10.200
Well, "US News" should
stop those liars.

09:10.233 --> 09:11.200
They try.

09:11.233 --> 09:12.467
But a bigger problem
than schools

09:12.500 --> 09:15.267
lying about the rankings
is schools gaming them.

09:15.300 --> 09:16.733
Ooh, gaming,
like Overwatch?

09:16.767 --> 09:17.867
Oh, I love Overwatch.

09:17.900 --> 09:19.833
I'm a Hanzo main.
Ugh.

09:19.867 --> 09:22.933
And no, I'm talking about
schools that game the system.

09:22.967 --> 09:26.100
Northeastern sent out 200,000
personalized letters

09:26.133 --> 09:28.000
encouraging students to apply

09:28.033 --> 09:30.833
even though they only
had room for 2800.

09:30.867 --> 09:34.233
Northeastern wants you!

09:34.267 --> 09:37.233
Not you,
not you, not you.

09:37.267 --> 09:39.733
This allowed them to pick
and choose the students

09:39.767 --> 09:42.300
that best fit
US News's formula.

09:42.333 --> 09:44.900
You'll improve our
rankings real nice.

09:44.933 --> 09:46.300
That seems
kind of shady.

09:46.333 --> 09:47.767
And it gets worse.

09:47.800 --> 09:51.100
To attract the right type of
students, schools spend massive

09:51.133 --> 09:54.100
amounts of money building luxury
dorms with fancy amenities

09:54.133 --> 09:56.867
that have nothing to do
with education at all.

09:56.900 --> 09:59.533
We simply must
get our ranking up.

09:59.567 --> 10:01.633
Why don't we improve
our graduation rate?

10:01.667 --> 10:05.067
Nope! Let's build an IMAX
theater, a rock-climbing wall

10:05.100 --> 10:08.000
and two, no three fraternity
hazing cabanas.

10:08.033 --> 10:10.967
And we'll pay for them by...
raising tuition or something.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.567
Now!
Get building!

10:13.600 --> 10:15.067
(jack hammering)

10:15.100 --> 10:16.900
Out of all the criteria
"US News" uses

10:16.933 --> 10:18.967
to rank
the be colleges,

10:19.000 --> 10:20.900
price isn't one of them.

10:20.933 --> 10:23.467
And since 1963, the cost of
attending a private

10:23.500 --> 10:26.233
four-year college
has almost tripled.

10:26.267 --> 10:29.033
(coins jingling, cheering)

10:29.067 --> 10:30.133
That's insanely high.

10:30.167 --> 10:32.100
Like, whippets for
the first time high.

10:32.133 --> 10:33.467
Yeah, it is.

10:33.500 --> 10:37.033
Today, the average cost for just
one year at a private college

10:37.067 --> 10:39.833
is over $39,000.

10:39.867 --> 10:42.333
That's about ten grand more
than most Americans

10:42.367 --> 10:44.600
even make in a year.

10:44.633 --> 10:45.767
One year's tuition.

10:45.800 --> 10:47.233
That will cost you
your car...

10:47.267 --> 10:48.467
(car passing, honks)

10:48.500 --> 10:49.967
Your home...
(doorbell chimes)

10:50.000 --> 10:53.100
Your kidneys.
(knives slicing)

10:53.133 --> 10:56.300
Guess I'll find some other
way to filter my blood.

10:56.333 --> 10:57.433
Think about that.

10:57.467 --> 10:59.500
Even though the cost
of college is skyrocketing,

10:59.533 --> 11:02.433
we still pick schools based
on an arbitrary list

11:02.467 --> 11:05.533
that has rewarded colleges
for wasting money

11:05.567 --> 11:08.400
leaving students like you
to foot the bill.

11:08.433 --> 11:10.667
Dude, what the vape!

11:10.700 --> 11:14.067
First, you tell me that
if I ever wanna be rich,
I have to go to college.

11:14.100 --> 11:16.800
Then you tell me
that I probably can't even
afford to go to college.

11:16.833 --> 11:21.433
How will I make an app
that identifies cheeses?!

11:21.467 --> 11:23.167
Oh!

11:25.633 --> 11:27.167
I know.

11:27.200 --> 11:29.333
Students loans, of course.

11:29.367 --> 11:30.833
Who cares if tuition
is high?

11:30.867 --> 11:35.333
I take out a loan and bam,
I can afford any school I want.

11:35.367 --> 11:36.667
No sweat.

11:36.700 --> 11:39.100
Actually, student loans
are crippling the finances

11:39.133 --> 11:40.467
of millions.

11:40.500 --> 11:41.967
Hey, guys, kegger
at the crew house.

11:42.000 --> 11:45.767
Let me tell you about it.
I'm listening, kegger!

11:45.800 --> 11:48.767
(man over PA)
If there's a Cole Tyson here,
please come to the Quad.

11:48.800 --> 11:51.367
Your mom is looking for you
and thinks you're dead.

11:51.400 --> 11:52.533
(whistling)

11:54.000 --> 11:57.000
**

11:57.033 --> 11:58.567
Hello, everyone.
I'm here behind the scenes

11:58.600 --> 11:59.733
at "Adam Ruins Everything,"

11:59.767 --> 12:02.100
talking to Cynthia Kao
and Peter Miller,

12:02.133 --> 12:04.133
the writer and researcher
for this episode.

12:04.167 --> 12:06.100
Was there a particularly
interesting fact

12:06.133 --> 12:08.933
or funny joke that did not make
it into the episode?
(Cynthia) Yes.

12:08.967 --> 12:12.067
You're six times more likely to
be killed by tap water

12:12.100 --> 12:13.833
than to become
a self-made billionaire.

12:13.867 --> 12:15.267
(laughter)

12:15.300 --> 12:16.367
(Adam)
Wait...
Yeah.

12:16.400 --> 12:17.900
I was just looking
at our list

12:17.933 --> 12:20.000
of things that are
more likely to happen

12:20.033 --> 12:24.167
than becoming a self-made
dropout billionaire...

12:24.200 --> 12:26.167
Yeah.
You're four times
more likely to be

12:26.200 --> 12:27.667
murdered at the
Grand Canyon.

12:27.700 --> 12:29.267
(laughter)

12:29.300 --> 12:32.567
Um...
Wait, where did
this list come from?

12:32.600 --> 12:35.500
That, I think,
is from "Forbes."

12:35.533 --> 12:37.500
Uh...
What are they
doing at "Forbes"?

12:37.533 --> 12:39.467
They wanted to say how unlikely
you are to win the lottery,

12:39.500 --> 12:41.133
but since they're
giving me the odds,

12:41.167 --> 12:43.133
I can apply this.
Yeah, to anything.

12:43.167 --> 12:44.867
It's a real struggle
to not just

12:44.900 --> 12:47.100
assign people stuff
that we just want to know.

12:47.133 --> 12:49.133
'Cause we were, like, hanging
around and we were like...

12:49.167 --> 12:51.400
we were like, "hey, why does,
uh... why does your cell phone

12:51.433 --> 12:53.067
always stop working
when you're in the bathroom

12:53.100 --> 12:54.467
of an office building?

12:54.500 --> 12:55.700
And I asked Peter that idly

12:55.733 --> 12:56.867
and then 20 minutes later

12:56.900 --> 12:58.700
you sent me an article.
Here's why.
Yeah.

12:58.733 --> 12:59.733
It's because...

12:59.767 --> 13:03.067
I couldn't stop
thinking about it.

13:03.100 --> 13:05.067
What was the thing that you
learned that surprised you
the most?

13:05.100 --> 13:07.200
That you actually need
a college degree,

13:07.233 --> 13:08.700
I guess, in this economy.
Yeah.

13:08.733 --> 13:10.767
I didn't realize that the
economy was changing so much.

13:10.800 --> 13:12.467
(Peter)
I think it was just
the scale of the problem

13:12.500 --> 13:14.400
surprised me
at every turn.

13:14.433 --> 13:15.733
And even when
researching the act

13:15.767 --> 13:17.467
about "US News
and World Report",

13:17.500 --> 13:18.667
I mean, I knew some
gaming took place,

13:18.700 --> 13:20.867
I didn't realize
how brazen it was.
Mm-hm.

13:20.900 --> 13:22.033
I was constantly surprised

13:22.067 --> 13:24.600
by these former
presidents of universities

13:24.633 --> 13:27.667
who could come out and say, "Oh,
yeah, I did that, it was great."

13:27.700 --> 13:29.033
I hacked the system.
Yeah.

13:29.067 --> 13:30.733
Give me-- give me praise.
(both)
Mm-hm.

13:30.767 --> 13:32.867
Well, thank you guys
so much for being here
and for working on the show.

13:32.900 --> 13:34.200
And thank you guys
for watching it.

13:34.233 --> 13:35.867
We'll be right back with more
"Adam Ruins Everything."

13:38.767 --> 13:40.333
(music playing, laughter)

13:40.367 --> 13:42.033
Finally, a party.

13:42.067 --> 13:44.900
I was stressing so hard about
how to pay for college.

13:44.933 --> 13:46.133
But now that I know
I could just take out

13:46.167 --> 13:47.767
a bunch of student loans,
I can chill.

13:47.800 --> 13:49.133
Cole, wait.

13:49.167 --> 13:51.467
The truth is student debt
is crippling the finances

13:51.500 --> 13:54.467
of millions of people,
and there's no end in sight.

13:54.500 --> 13:58.633
Chill, Dad,
I'll be fine.

13:58.667 --> 14:00.300
(chatter)

14:00.333 --> 14:03.633
Oh-ho-ho, select!

14:03.667 --> 14:05.267
'Sup, friendo?

14:05.300 --> 14:06.500
Care for a loanski?

14:06.533 --> 14:08.100
Hit me, loan tender.

14:08.133 --> 14:10.900
See, Adam, student
loans help people.

14:10.933 --> 14:13.400
A lot of us wouldn't be able
to go to college without them.

14:13.433 --> 14:15.033
(Adam)
Right, they're
a necessity.

14:15.067 --> 14:17.067
That's why it's
even more disturbing

14:17.100 --> 14:18.267
what they're
doing to people.

14:18.300 --> 14:20.700
Chill, Sheldon,
everybody's doing it.

14:20.733 --> 14:21.833
That's true.

14:21.867 --> 14:24.967
42 million Americans
have student loan debt

14:25.000 --> 14:27.867
totaling $1.3 trillion.

14:27.900 --> 14:29.900
Trillion? That's a whole
lot of Pokémon Go coins.

14:29.933 --> 14:33.500
And student loan debt has become
the worst kind of debt.

14:33.533 --> 14:34.933
Let me tell you a story.

14:34.967 --> 14:38.400
Before 1972, students could
get federally backed loans

14:38.433 --> 14:39.633
to pay for school.

14:39.667 --> 14:41.967
But there weren't
enough to go around.

14:42.000 --> 14:43.933
Please, sir,
may I have a loan?

14:43.967 --> 14:45.900
All tapped out, sorry.

14:45.933 --> 14:47.067
(Adam)
But then, Richard Nixon

14:47.100 --> 14:49.667
created the Student Loan
Marketing Association.

14:49.700 --> 14:51.933
Or as it's known today
Sallie Mae.

14:51.967 --> 14:54.300
Now, Sallie, your job
is to buy loans from the banks

14:54.333 --> 14:55.767
so they can lend more.

14:55.800 --> 14:57.367
But Uncle Sam is watching.

14:57.400 --> 14:59.933
So, don't be a crook.

14:59.967 --> 15:02.767
This system freed up financial
institutions to issue

15:02.800 --> 15:05.800
more loans which meant more
students could go to college.

15:05.833 --> 15:07.667
Please, just one.

15:07.700 --> 15:09.800
Look, I told you,
there's no more--

15:09.833 --> 15:12.100
Whoa!
Thanks, Sallie!

15:12.133 --> 15:13.933
The party's on!

15:13.967 --> 15:15.900
(crowd whooping)

15:15.933 --> 15:18.133
(Uncle Sam)
Uh, loan responsibly, now.

15:18.167 --> 15:19.867
Just loan responsibly.

15:19.900 --> 15:20.867
Seems like a good system.

15:20.900 --> 15:22.033
It was!

15:22.067 --> 15:24.033
But the party foul began
when the government moved

15:24.067 --> 15:27.433
to privatize Sallie Mae
in the 1990s.

15:27.467 --> 15:30.067
I'm tired
of playing chaperone.

15:30.100 --> 15:31.700
You're free, Sallie.

15:31.733 --> 15:33.133
(gasps)

15:33.167 --> 15:35.467
Free market.

15:35.500 --> 15:37.633
(Adam)
A compromise between
President Clinton

15:37.667 --> 15:41.033
and congressional republicans
cut Sallie Mae loose.

15:41.067 --> 15:44.700
Who wants loans, bitches?!

15:44.733 --> 15:47.033
(Adam)
Now Sallie Mae was in it
for the profits.

15:47.067 --> 15:49.067
And profits they received.

15:49.100 --> 15:52.200
They made a fortune
off of government fees.

15:52.233 --> 15:53.900
This chick is awesome.

15:53.933 --> 15:57.100
I'm gonna get
loaned up tonight.

15:57.133 --> 15:58.800
Sallie Mae poured their
new-found wealth

15:58.833 --> 16:02.100
into projects designed to
increase those profits.

16:02.133 --> 16:03.933
Come on, dude,
she's not that shady.

16:03.967 --> 16:06.133
Oh, you'd be surprised.

16:06.167 --> 16:10.000
Fearing competition, Sallie Mae
started marketing like crazy.

16:10.033 --> 16:11.800
(cash register opens)

16:11.833 --> 16:14.467
(Adam)
They paid colleges to drop
direct government loans

16:14.500 --> 16:16.100
and sign up
for their program...

16:16.133 --> 16:19.767
Hey! Ditch the clown
and this could all be yours.

16:22.267 --> 16:25.233
(Adam)
... and sponsored cruises
for financial aid officers.

16:25.267 --> 16:28.867
Oh, you boys have
to come on my boat.

16:28.900 --> 16:31.600
Sallie Mae even placed
undercover reps

16:31.633 --> 16:34.000
in university call centers
where they tricked students

16:34.033 --> 16:37.467
into thinking they were talking
to college loan officers.

16:37.500 --> 16:39.000
You have got to meet
this girl.

16:39.033 --> 16:40.333
She is so cool.

16:40.367 --> 16:43.433
And she didn't
even pay me to say that.

16:43.467 --> 16:46.800
Sallie Mae, really doing
everybody dirty like that.

16:46.833 --> 16:47.867
I'm afraid so.

16:47.900 --> 16:49.367
And soon, students
were stuck

16:49.400 --> 16:51.733
with the worst kind
of debt you can have.

16:51.767 --> 16:54.033
Often, they're encouraged
to take out more loans

16:54.067 --> 16:56.733
than they can even afford.

16:56.767 --> 16:57.867
What's happening?

16:57.900 --> 17:00.400
Don't worry about
that right now.

17:00.433 --> 17:03.200
These are the best
four years of your life!

17:03.233 --> 17:05.967
Yeah, I'm 17,
I know what I'm doing.

17:09.000 --> 17:10.667
Hey, my payments
are super low.

17:10.700 --> 17:11.933
I'll finish these soon.

17:11.967 --> 17:14.967
Sorry, you won't.

17:15.000 --> 17:16.233
(Cole)
No!

17:16.267 --> 17:18.900
Many borrowers have monthly
payments that are so low,

17:18.933 --> 17:20.900
they don't even
cover the interest.

17:20.933 --> 17:23.100
You could be in a situation
where you're paying hundreds

17:23.133 --> 17:26.767
of dollars a month, but the
amount you owe is still growing.

17:26.800 --> 17:29.033
Oh, God, I can't
keep up with this.

17:29.067 --> 17:32.167
One in four borrowers are
behind on their student loans.

17:32.200 --> 17:34.333
And over eight million
are in default.

17:34.367 --> 17:35.867
What?

17:35.900 --> 17:38.167
That's crazy!

17:38.200 --> 17:39.367
(loud thud)

17:39.400 --> 17:41.133
And here's where
it gets really scary.

17:41.167 --> 17:42.667
Unlike other types of debt,

17:42.700 --> 17:45.133
if you default on
a federal student loan,

17:45.167 --> 17:48.300
the government can garnish
up to 15% of your wages,

17:48.333 --> 17:51.633
tax refunds and social
security benefits.

17:51.667 --> 17:54.667
Hell, yeah!
Rent money, baby.

17:54.700 --> 17:55.900
What the--

17:55.933 --> 17:59.800
Sorry, Uncle chooses
where your money goes now.

17:59.833 --> 18:02.467
(Adam)
And if your parents
co-signed your loan,

18:02.500 --> 18:05.033
their income can
be garnished too.

18:05.067 --> 18:06.367
I'm sorry, Mom and Dad.

18:06.400 --> 18:07.500
I just wanted to go here

18:07.533 --> 18:09.767
because the school colors
matched my Flyknits.

18:09.800 --> 18:13.200
Adam, this is too much.

18:13.233 --> 18:15.633
Make it stop!
I wanna file
for bankruptcy.

18:15.667 --> 18:16.767
Oh!

18:16.800 --> 18:18.467
Sorry, you can't.

18:18.500 --> 18:20.867
Sallie Mae spent decades
lobbying congress

18:20.900 --> 18:23.700
to roll back
consumer protections.

18:23.733 --> 18:26.233
And it all paid off in 2005

18:26.267 --> 18:29.467
when Sallie Mae won their
crowning achievement.

18:29.500 --> 18:32.633
Because now, unlike almost
all other forms of debt,

18:32.667 --> 18:35.133
it is nearly impossible
to declare bankruptcy

18:35.167 --> 18:36.667
for student loans.

18:36.700 --> 18:37.900
It's insane.

18:37.933 --> 18:40.067
You sign a piece of paper
when you're 18,

18:40.100 --> 18:42.333
and you can get
stuck for life.

18:42.367 --> 18:46.333
(moaning)

18:46.367 --> 18:47.967
Oh, I can't get them off!

18:48.000 --> 18:51.733
In 2010, the government
finally cut out
middle men like Sallie Mae,

18:51.767 --> 18:53.167
but it wasn't enough.

18:53.200 --> 18:55.733
A generation of Americans
have had to financially

18:55.767 --> 18:58.933
cripple themselves with debt
just to get the basic education

18:58.967 --> 19:01.833
that will allow them
to survive in today's economy.

19:01.867 --> 19:03.300
That's nauseating.

19:03.333 --> 19:04.533
Yeah, it is.

19:04.567 --> 19:06.467
But let me tell you about
a few things you can do to--

19:06.500 --> 19:07.933
Oh, I really mean
that's nauseating.

19:07.967 --> 19:09.133
Oh, God!
(retching)

19:09.167 --> 19:12.033
Oh, for once,
Adam isn't the barf boy.

19:12.067 --> 19:13.067
(music playing)

19:14.567 --> 19:17.333
Oh, for once,
Adam isn't the barf boy.

19:19.967 --> 19:21.700
Hey, Cole?
You okay?

19:21.733 --> 19:23.700
No, I'm not okay.

19:23.733 --> 19:25.900
First you tell me
that if I ever wanna succeed,

19:25.933 --> 19:27.600
I have to go to college.

19:27.633 --> 19:29.000
Then you tell me
if I go to college,

19:29.033 --> 19:31.467
I could be trapped
in debt until I die.

19:31.500 --> 19:33.167
This whole system
is effed up!

19:33.200 --> 19:34.700
Yeah, I agree.

19:34.733 --> 19:37.000
It is effed up that
we built an economy

19:37.033 --> 19:39.233
that requires a college
degree to participate,

19:39.267 --> 19:44.633
then forces people to take on
massive loans that bleed them
dry just to get that degree.

19:44.667 --> 19:47.733
But there are a few things
you can do to reduce the burden.

19:47.767 --> 19:49.267
Come on, let's get
out of here.

19:49.300 --> 19:51.267
This place smells like
cigarettes and feet.

19:55.167 --> 19:56.400
Oh, hey, Adam.

19:56.433 --> 19:58.033
I was just practicing
"Wonderwall."

19:58.067 --> 19:59.833
You wanna hear?
Maybe later.

19:59.867 --> 20:01.400
Cole, this
is Heather Jarvis.

20:01.433 --> 20:04.267
She's a lawyer who specializes
in student loan law.

20:04.300 --> 20:05.367
Hi, Cole.

20:05.400 --> 20:06.733
First of all,
I want you to know,

20:06.767 --> 20:08.833
it's okay to be confused
about this stuff.

20:08.867 --> 20:10.100
When I first
went to school,

20:10.133 --> 20:12.867
I borrowed $125,000

20:12.900 --> 20:15.467
without fully understanding
what the consequences were.

20:15.500 --> 20:16.500
Oh, dang.

20:16.533 --> 20:17.933
And I had it easy.

20:17.967 --> 20:20.333
I've had some clients who
have lost their opportunity

20:20.367 --> 20:24.000
for debt forgiveness or seen
their monthly payments go up

20:24.033 --> 20:27.067
just because of bad advice they
got from their loan provider.

20:27.100 --> 20:29.133
Lame-ass
loan provider.

20:29.167 --> 20:32.167
I'm low-key mad
now for real.

20:32.200 --> 20:33.367
So, what do I do?

20:33.400 --> 20:34.967
Shop around.

20:35.000 --> 20:36.500
The most expansive school
you get into

20:36.533 --> 20:38.333
might not be the best
one for you.

20:38.367 --> 20:41.400
A degree from an in-state public
school is usually a better

20:41.433 --> 20:44.067
investment than one from an
expensive private school.

20:44.100 --> 20:46.267
And at a fraction
of the cost.

20:46.300 --> 20:48.533
And don't forget
about community colleges.

20:48.567 --> 20:49.967
They have low tuition.

20:50.000 --> 20:51.500
And you can usually
transfer credits

20:51.533 --> 20:53.633
to a bigger name school
after a couple of years.

20:53.667 --> 20:56.233
Community colleges
are a great resource,

20:56.267 --> 20:58.167
one our government
really should invest in.

20:58.200 --> 21:01.067
But what if I still
need that cash?

21:01.100 --> 21:02.767
Well, avoid
borrowing too much.

21:02.800 --> 21:04.767
And avoid private
student loans.

21:04.800 --> 21:09.033
And one thing everybody needs
to do is fill out the FAFSA,

21:09.067 --> 21:11.067
That's what let's you know
what scholarships and grants

21:11.100 --> 21:12.567
you're eligible for.

21:12.600 --> 21:14.133
And the great thing
about grants

21:14.167 --> 21:15.700
is that you don't
have to pay them back.

21:15.733 --> 21:17.433
Whoa, tight.

21:17.467 --> 21:19.067
Cole's getting paid.

21:19.100 --> 21:21.033
And we all need
to be advocates

21:21.067 --> 21:23.300
to simplify and improve
this system.

21:23.333 --> 21:26.200
Students need bankruptcy
protection as much as anybody.

21:26.233 --> 21:28.000
Word.
Thanks, Heather.

21:28.033 --> 21:29.000
No problem.

21:29.033 --> 21:32.933
Now if you'll
excuse me...

21:32.967 --> 21:33.933
* Today

21:33.967 --> 21:35.000
No.

21:35.033 --> 21:36.367
* Today

21:36.400 --> 21:38.733
No.
Never mind.

21:38.767 --> 21:40.367
(Cole's mom)
Cole?! Cole?!

21:40.400 --> 21:42.200
Mom! Mom, I'm over here.

21:42.233 --> 21:43.933
Oh.

21:43.967 --> 21:45.167
I'm okay.

21:45.200 --> 21:47.533
Cole, I have been looking
everywhere for you.

21:47.567 --> 21:49.000
Where have you been?

21:49.033 --> 21:51.967
I got drunk with this old man
and he taught me a lot.

21:52.000 --> 21:53.100
It's not as bad
as it sounds.

21:53.133 --> 21:54.667
(chuckling)

21:54.700 --> 21:56.700
He showed me
you were right.

21:56.733 --> 21:58.967
I need to go to college.

21:59.000 --> 22:01.400
Wait... really?

22:01.433 --> 22:02.867
Mm-hmm.
You like it here.

22:02.900 --> 22:06.467
I do, but I think I wanna give
community college a try.

22:06.500 --> 22:08.200
Save some money.

22:08.233 --> 22:10.533
If that's what you want,
that's what I want too.

22:10.567 --> 22:13.433
Now let's get you home so you
miss debate with Spalding.

22:15.167 --> 22:18.367
Thanks, Adam, you're a pretty
select dude, you know that?

22:18.400 --> 22:21.300
Wow, it was all worth it
for that.

22:26.600 --> 22:29.400
**

22:29.433 --> 22:31.133
You know, the invention
of the Solo cup

22:31.167 --> 22:32.967
is actually quite remarkable.

22:33.000 --> 22:36.400
The Solo Company was relatively
forgettable until the 1970s

22:36.433 --> 22:38.500
when Robert L. Hulseman
invented the sturdy,

22:38.533 --> 22:40.567
yet disposable Solo cup.

22:40.600 --> 22:42.400
Now, while the iconic color
is red,

22:42.433 --> 22:44.533
his favorite
was actually blue.

22:44.567 --> 22:47.567
Huh, guess I'm drinking
alone tonight.

22:47.600 --> 22:49.400
Whoo!

22:49.433 --> 22:50.767
I did it!

22:52.800 --> 22:56.200
**

22:56.233 --> 22:59.067
Hey, everybody.
I'm here behind the scenes
of "Adam Ruins Everything"

22:59.100 --> 23:00.767
'cause I got more questions
for Heather Jarvis.

23:00.800 --> 23:01.900
Thank you for
being here, Heather.

23:01.933 --> 23:03.100
My pleasure, Adam.

23:03.133 --> 23:05.900
So, on the show,
we talk a lot about Sallie Mae

23:05.933 --> 23:07.500
and their role in
the student debt crisis.

23:07.533 --> 23:09.933
What can we do
on a national level,

23:09.967 --> 23:12.700
or a state level even,
to make this problem better?

23:12.733 --> 23:16.200
We need to focus on controlling
the cost of education.

23:16.233 --> 23:19.467
And also make sure that
there is need based aid

23:19.500 --> 23:21.867
for people who don't have
money to pay for college.

23:21.900 --> 23:23.600
And let your
representatives know

23:23.633 --> 23:25.433
that you care about
affordable education,

23:25.467 --> 23:27.033
affordable student loans,

23:27.067 --> 23:28.533
and things like
loan forgiveness.

23:28.567 --> 23:33.333
Federal loans can be discharged
if you become disabled, or dead.

23:33.367 --> 23:35.600
They have flexible
repayment options.

23:35.633 --> 23:38.400
Wow, the advantage is
they don't come calling
if you're dead.

23:38.433 --> 23:40.667
But private lenders
have been known

23:40.700 --> 23:43.800
to go after families
of dead students...
Really?

23:43.833 --> 23:45.900
... for private student
loan repayment.

23:45.933 --> 23:48.000
Oh, that's despicable.
Yeah.

23:48.033 --> 23:50.100
I don't think anyone would
agree that that's okay to do.

23:50.133 --> 23:53.867
Let me ask you this.
When primary education
became a necessity,

23:53.900 --> 23:56.367
we made that, you know,
free access to everyone.

23:56.400 --> 23:57.900
Everyone has the option
to go to a public school.

23:57.933 --> 24:00.967
Now that it's so clear
that a secondary education,

24:01.000 --> 24:02.400
is also a necessity.

24:02.433 --> 24:04.300
Would you advocate
that we also make

24:04.333 --> 24:06.733
college free tuition based,
at least on some level.

24:06.767 --> 24:08.533
Absolutely, I think that
there's definitely room

24:08.567 --> 24:09.967
for that in the discussion.

24:10.000 --> 24:13.067
And I think it's also fair
to expect students and families

24:13.100 --> 24:15.200
to invest some
of their resources

24:15.233 --> 24:16.867
to the extent
that they're able to.

24:16.900 --> 24:18.933
So, if students
do these things,

24:18.967 --> 24:20.767
if they look for
the more reasonable loans,

24:20.800 --> 24:22.167
if they get all the
grants they can afford,

24:22.200 --> 24:23.533
if they look
for a low-priced school,

24:23.567 --> 24:24.667
is there a chance
that they can

24:24.700 --> 24:26.200
get through this horribly
confusing system?

24:26.233 --> 24:28.900
People are going to do just fine
as long as they get informed,

24:28.933 --> 24:31.400
ask a lot of questions,
and keep pressing

24:31.433 --> 24:33.067
until they get
the information they need.

24:33.100 --> 24:35.033
Well, thank you so much for
coming down to talk to us

24:35.067 --> 24:36.267
about this, Heather.
You're welcome.

24:36.300 --> 24:37.667
It was a pleasure
being here.
