To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist,

but secretly, with the help
of my friends at 8. TA R. Labs,

00:13.264 --> 00:16.427
I ﬁght crime
and ﬁnd other meta-humans like me.

00:16.976 --> 00:18.762
I hunted down the man
who killed my mother,

00:18.936 --> 00:22.224
but in doing so,
I opened up our world to new threats.

00:22.398 --> 00:25.435

fast enough to stop them.

This nonsense?

00:33.492 --> 00:35.198
I don't actually have to
explain myself to you.

00:35.369 --> 00:36.449

She says you haven't been by in a while.

00:41.083 --> 00:42.584
She thinks it's because
you're angry with her.

00:42.752 --> 00:43.741
I have every right to be angry.

00:43.920 --> 00:45.751

-What?

00:45.922 --> 00:47.753
I was accepted into
the Forensic Science program

00:47.924 --> 00:49.130
at Midway City University.

00:49.300 --> 00:50.790
We got Turtle locked up in the pipeline.

00:50.968 --> 00:53.584
All we gotta do is use him to ﬁgure out
how to steal Zoom's speed,

00:53.763 --> 00:55.003
and then we'll get your daughter back.

I never thought of being anything else.

for the same reasons.

Going to space is like the fastest
a human being can go.

The fact that Wally even wants to
get to know me is the big win here.

not chasing him out of the house?

Nope. Not starting that fetish.

-I am.

11:59.177 --> 12:00.428

-interesting, actually.
-Mmm.

the windshield of his hot-rod,

12:11.773 --> 12:14.105
he was in a coma for six months.

12:15.319 --> 12:18.152
This kid, he died.

12:18.614 --> 12:22.323
He wrapped his car around a tree
at a 110 miles per hour.

12:22.659 --> 12:25.947
They were all street racers. Dad,
and Wally could be the next one.

12:27.956 --> 12:30.413
What do you want me to do. Iris,
lock him up?

12:30.876 --> 12:32.537
Or stop the races.

12:32.711 --> 12:33.746
Look, I Ieamed a long time ago,

you can't stop your kids
from being who they are.

12:35.923 --> 12:37.038

I confronted him about the races,

12:51.313 --> 12:52.644
it didn't go so well, remember?

12:52.814 --> 12:54.429
And I need it to go well with Wally.

12:54.608 --> 12:56.348

12:56.526 --> 12:58.312
I want him in our lives.

13:00.030 --> 13:03.238

It was suffocation.

20:57.340 --> 20:59.547
that Francine meant to me
what she did to you.

But in the short time
that I got to spend with her,

21:01.428 --> 21:03.419

Zoom wants you to get faster.

37:38.090 --> 37:41.548
he wants you to have more Speed Force
in you for when he ﬁnally takes it.

37:41.718 --> 37:44.505
Send me back. use the Implosion Reactor
to shut down the breach.

37:46.849 --> 37:48.180
L k x - -

37:49.977 --> 37:53.310
And Zoom will never be
able to cross over, ever again.

37:54.356 --> 37:55.641
rmnmummmmm

37:56.108 --> 37:57.348
What about your daughter?

37:59.486 --> 38:01.522
Jesse's my battle to ﬁght. Not yours.

38:18.881 --> 38:19.870
(GROANS)

38:22.426 --> 38:24.712
Hey. How are you feeling?

38:25.804 --> 38:28.796
Mmm, like I could
use some pizza right now.

38:29.057 --> 38:30.046
(BOTH LAUGH)

38:31.059 --> 38:34.051
But they're letting you out tomorrow.
so I can get you any kind you want.

38:34.229 --> 38:35.730
-From anywhere you want.
-Deal.

38:38.484 --> 38:39.724
You know, um,

38:40.903 --> 38:45.146
growing up, we didn't have a lot of money
to go to the movies or buy toys.

38:47.576 --> 38:50.659
Instead, she would just take me in the car
and we'd go for these long drives.

38:50.829 --> 38:52.945
Just her and I and her music.

38:54.917 --> 38:57.579
I remember being on the road with her
and just...

38:59.838 --> 39:02.420
Watching the scenery ﬂash by
and feeling so happy.

39:06.220 --> 39:07.756
Now, when I race.

39:09.223 --> 39:11.430
feeling that rush of speed, it's like...

39:14.144 --> 39:16.476
It's like I get to go back to those days.

39:20.526 --> 39:24.018
I didn't want to stop. because if I do...

39:28.075 --> 39:29.360
(SIGHS)

39:31.495 --> 39:33.281
See? That wasn't so hard.

39:37.501 --> 39:39.207
-Actually, it was pretty hard.
-(BOTH LAUGH)

39:42.965 --> 39:46.708
This is a sample of Bany's cells
after whatever Hany did to them.

39:46.885 --> 39:49.171
As you can see,
not only is it drained of the Speed Force

39:49.346 --> 39:52.679
but it's also presenting itself
as chromosomal damage.

39:52.849 --> 39:55.340
If Hany kept doing what he was doing,

39:56.144 --> 39:58.476
he could have taken
your powers permanently.

39:59.106 --> 40:01.142
Even Evil Wells couldn't ﬁgure out
how to do that one.

40:01.316 --> 40:02.522
Well, look.
Somebody better send his ass back

40:02.693 --> 40:04.058
to where he came from
or I'm gonna shoot him.

40:04.236 --> 40:05.646
-Amen.
-No.

40:06.738 --> 40:07.818
What do you mean, "no"?

40:09.241 --> 40:12.324
What would we have done,
if we were in his position?

40:12.869 --> 40:15.531
I mean, what would you do
if it was Iris, Joe?

40:15.831 --> 40:18.197
Cisco, when Snart kidnapped you,

40:18.375 --> 40:20.787
threatened to kill your brother
unless you helped, you did.

40:21.211 --> 40:24.248
And none of us judged you for that.
We still don't.

40:24.506 --> 40:26.042
Because when it comes to family.

40:26.216 --> 40:29.049
when it comes to the people
that we all love,

40:30.178 --> 40:33.011
we're all vulnerable. None of us are
above making a wrong decision.

40:34.266 --> 40:36.678
He could have done it,
he could've stolen my speed,

40:36.852 --> 40:38.843
gotten away with it.
None of us would've even known.

40:39.021 --> 40:40.181
JITilﬂiFl'Hl

40:40.355 --> 40:43.472
And now his daughter's gonna die
and we're okay with that?

40:43.859 --> 40:45.065
I can't just give up on her.

40:45.235 --> 40:47.851
I can't give up on a world.

40:48.405 --> 40:51.272
This is a world full of people
who are facing death.

40:52.868 --> 40:56.076
I don't know, I mean, I may not be
fast enough to beat Zoom yet, but...

40:57.539 --> 41:01.123
I'm not gonna just close the breaches
and forget about it.

41:03.712 --> 41:05.293
We have to help Wells.

41:07.924 --> 41:09.380
Look, guys, I—

41:14.056 --> 41:17.173
I let him stay when literally all of you
told me not to.

41:17.351 --> 41:19.842
So everything that's happened up
until this point, it's on me.

41:20.020 --> 41:22.227
But this has to be a group decision.

41:28.445 --> 41:29.605
Come on.

41:38.413 --> 41:39.528
Well...

41:42.334 --> 41:43.870
I guess this is good-bye.

41:44.544 --> 41:46.250
No. It's not.

41:47.756 --> 41:49.121
I told you we're a team.

41:49.633 --> 41:50.998
Now you're a part of it.

41:52.386 --> 41:55.173
We're gonna help you save Jesse.
We're not sending you through alone.

41:56.515 --> 41:57.971
We're going to Earth-2.

42:29.464 --> 42:30.453
