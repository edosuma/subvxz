00:00.671 --> 00:01.939
Bring daddy the remote.

00:02.340 --> 00:03.440
Bring the remote to daddy.

00:03.541 --> 00:05.074
Come on, Emma. I know you can do it.

00:05.075 --> 00:07.043
Bring the remote to daddy.

00:07.245 --> 00:08.410
Yes!

00:08.511 --> 00:10.279
Whoo!

00:11.648 --> 00:13.282
She's like a dog that can hold stuff.

00:13.383 --> 00:14.450
Babies are amazing.

00:14.551 --> 00:18.287
You know, babies aren't tiny bald butlers

00:18.388 --> 00:19.789
trained to serve you.

00:19.890 --> 00:21.891
Uh, yeah they are.

00:21.992 --> 00:24.160
And I know that because you trained me.

00:24.261 --> 00:26.763
I was the only kid in preschool
who could make a Margarita.

00:28.898 --> 00:31.032
Aww, you were so cute when you said

00:31.134 --> 00:33.501
"Bwended or on the wocks?"

00:35.171 --> 00:38.306
All right, but we still need
to baby-proof this place.

00:38.407 --> 00:39.540
I mean, the sharp edges,

00:39.642 --> 00:41.076
the cabinets, the light sockets.

00:41.177 --> 00:43.211
We are locking it down, people.

00:45.248 --> 00:47.215
Mom, I appreciate you wanting to help,

00:47.316 --> 00:49.216
but I would never let
anything bad happen to Emma.

00:49.317 --> 00:50.818
I've got an eye on her 24/7.

00:50.919 --> 00:52.887
Isn't that right, Emma?

00:52.988 --> 00:54.021
Emma?

00:54.122 --> 00:55.890
- Oh my God.
- Emma Emma!

00:59.261 --> 01:00.560
What are we gonna do?!

01:00.662 --> 01:03.430
Oh, I don't know. Run!

01:03.531 --> 01:05.599
No, Danny, this way! Come on!

01:06.634 --> 01:07.534
Go.

01:20.648 --> 01:22.816
Aw, come on. Aren't you gonna ask me

01:22.917 --> 01:25.051
about my amazing weekend
in the country with Georgie?

01:25.152 --> 01:28.154
Only if the story ends
with you leaving her there.

01:28.255 --> 01:29.889
Why don't you like her?

01:29.990 --> 01:32.325
I want you to like her. I really like her.

01:32.426 --> 01:33.626
Well, for one, she hates me,

01:33.727 --> 01:35.894
and two, she broke up me and Philip.

01:35.995 --> 01:37.896
So not a huge fan.

01:37.997 --> 01:40.533
I knew you were gonna
hold that against her.

01:40.634 --> 01:43.068
Is there any way you could
just give her a second chance?

01:43.169 --> 01:44.537
For me?

01:44.638 --> 01:47.206
Please?

01:47.307 --> 01:48.874
Fine.

01:48.975 --> 01:50.676
If you like her,

01:50.777 --> 01:52.645
then I will do my best to like her as well.

01:52.746 --> 01:54.112
Thank you.

01:54.214 --> 01:55.881
- Hi, Danny.
- Oh, hey.

01:55.982 --> 01:57.615
- Riley.
- Hi.

01:57.717 --> 01:58.951
If you're not careful,
they're going to start

01:59.052 --> 02:00.618
charging you rent for that stool.

02:03.656 --> 02:04.923
And that was my best.

02:05.024 --> 02:06.624
All right, I am out of here.

02:06.726 --> 02:09.294
Oh, what time do you need me to
be ready for the banquet tomorrow?

02:09.395 --> 02:12.297
Oh, are you going to the rangers
end-of-season banquet too?

02:12.398 --> 02:13.865
Uh, me too?

02:13.966 --> 02:15.032
Me only.

02:16.168 --> 02:18.336
Me not going, am I?

02:18.437 --> 02:19.871
Sorry.

02:19.972 --> 02:21.339
I kind of invited Georgie.

02:21.440 --> 02:23.007
But you should meet
us for the after-party.

02:23.108 --> 02:24.075
It's always the most fun.

02:24.176 --> 02:26.210
Danny, you can't do that to poor Riley.

02:26.311 --> 02:28.913
Nobody wants to feel like a third wheel.

02:29.014 --> 02:32.216
Especially when they've
already been run over by one.

02:32.317 --> 02:33.885
Now if you'll excuse me,

02:33.986 --> 02:35.552
I'm just... I'm gonna go call my office

02:35.653 --> 02:38.222
and let them know I'm available
for that overtime, after all.

02:38.323 --> 02:39.523
Yay me.

02:41.293 --> 02:42.894
Is it something I said?

02:42.995 --> 02:45.562
Uh, it was everything you said.

02:45.663 --> 02:47.564
You know she's my best friend, right?

02:47.665 --> 02:50.201
I know. I get it.

02:50.302 --> 02:52.402
Actually, I don't think you do.

02:52.503 --> 02:53.870
I don't want to start a relationship

02:53.971 --> 02:55.338
by laying down a bunch of rules,

02:55.439 --> 02:56.873
but you have to get along with Riley.

02:56.974 --> 02:58.775
She's always been there for me,

02:58.876 --> 03:00.410
and I will always be there for her.

03:00.511 --> 03:02.678
And I really need the
two of you to be friends.

03:02.780 --> 03:04.214
And I will.

03:04.315 --> 03:06.482
It's only because you're so adorable.

03:06.583 --> 03:08.118
No, you're so adorable.

03:08.219 --> 03:09.452
No, you are.

03:09.553 --> 03:10.453
We both are.

03:10.554 --> 03:11.554
Jinx! You owe me a kiss!

03:19.329 --> 03:20.863
Mom?

03:20.964 --> 03:22.097
What are you doing?

03:22.198 --> 03:24.867
Nothing.

03:24.968 --> 03:28.438
What's up with you?

03:28.539 --> 03:31.674
Did you baby-proof
yourself into the drawer?

03:31.775 --> 03:33.875
No.

03:33.977 --> 03:37.579
No, I'm just taking a break.

03:37.680 --> 03:39.581
Excuse me?

03:39.682 --> 03:41.683
Did there used to be
something here that we liked?

03:41.784 --> 03:43.652
I think we called it a foosball table.

03:43.753 --> 03:44.886
Oh, that thing?

03:44.988 --> 03:46.822
It was a death trap. It had to go.

03:46.923 --> 03:48.223
No no no no no!

03:48.325 --> 03:49.858
That table is Emma's college fund.

03:49.960 --> 03:52.961
Ben, having actually been to college,

03:53.062 --> 03:55.863
you know, I can pretty much assure you

03:55.965 --> 03:58.266
that they don't give out
foosball scholarships.

03:58.367 --> 03:59.800
No no no!

03:59.901 --> 04:01.602
Every day after work,
I take a part of my tips

04:01.703 --> 04:02.971
and stick them in the little hole.

04:03.072 --> 04:04.738
There were thousands of
dollars in there, Mom.

04:04.840 --> 04:07.208
Where is it?

04:07.309 --> 04:09.243
I sold it?

04:09.345 --> 04:10.411
You what?!

04:10.512 --> 04:12.013
Before you get too upset,

04:12.114 --> 04:14.147
I would like to present you

04:14.248 --> 04:15.883
a $20 bill

04:15.984 --> 04:18.819
for Emma's new college fund.

04:18.920 --> 04:20.420
Mom!

04:20.522 --> 04:22.356
Well, Honey, I'm sorry.

04:22.457 --> 04:25.225
I sold it to a couple of
nice fraternity brothers.

04:25.326 --> 04:26.861
Oh, wait wait, huh?

04:26.962 --> 04:28.562
I still got their number.

04:28.663 --> 04:32.132
All right, don't tell them I'm your mother.

04:32.233 --> 04:33.500
I'm hoping to get invited to...

04:33.601 --> 04:35.902
a few rush parties, so.

04:36.004 --> 04:37.137
Okay.

04:37.238 --> 04:38.405
Well, I'll just tell them what happened

04:38.506 --> 04:40.907
and we'll go over there
and get it, all right?

04:41.009 --> 04:42.209
My simple, naive,

04:42.310 --> 04:44.878
non-college-educated
friend Ben.

04:46.981 --> 04:48.748
Bro, I was a frat man,

04:48.849 --> 04:51.851
and we don't allow
civilians into our world.

04:51.952 --> 04:53.285
You know what? You're right.

04:53.387 --> 04:54.887
I don't speak frat, but you do.

04:54.988 --> 04:56.922
Come on, man, let's go
get Emma's money back.

04:57.024 --> 04:59.358
No no, guys! Hey!

04:59.459 --> 05:02.194
Hey, what about me?

05:09.969 --> 05:11.203
Oh, good.

05:11.304 --> 05:12.271
It was just an extension.

05:12.372 --> 05:13.571
Whoo.

05:17.309 --> 05:18.576
Hi, uh...

05:18.677 --> 05:19.710
What happened to Danny?

05:19.811 --> 05:21.913
Oh, he had to head back to the rink.

05:22.014 --> 05:24.215
Oh. Bye!

05:24.316 --> 05:26.217
Riley!

05:26.318 --> 05:28.586
I thought maybe we could hang out a little.

05:28.687 --> 05:30.221
Have some lunch.

05:30.322 --> 05:32.122
There's no reason we can't be friends.

05:32.223 --> 05:33.790
Sure there is.

05:33.891 --> 05:35.459
Uh, you insult me constantly,

05:35.560 --> 05:37.461
you had your brother break up with me,

05:37.562 --> 05:40.797
I got a super cute haircut
that you didn't even mention.

05:40.898 --> 05:42.566
Should I keep going, or are we good?

05:42.667 --> 05:44.201
Isn't there any way we can move on?

05:44.302 --> 05:45.469
Let the past be the past?

05:45.570 --> 05:47.237
Yeah...

05:47.338 --> 05:48.539
I'm thinking no.

05:48.639 --> 05:50.541
But, um...

05:50.641 --> 05:52.875
What am I gonna tell everyone at "Vogue"?

05:52.976 --> 05:54.477
You know I work at "Vogue," right?

05:54.578 --> 05:56.812
Yeah, it's right up there at the top of my

05:56.913 --> 05:58.481
"life's not fair" list.

05:58.582 --> 06:00.083
Well, um,

06:00.184 --> 06:03.018
I was talking to a few of
my colleagues about you,

06:03.120 --> 06:05.455
and we have this opening in legal.

06:05.556 --> 06:07.123
I'm sorry.

06:07.224 --> 06:09.192
"Vogue" needs a lawyer?

06:09.293 --> 06:10.526
Oh my God.

06:10.627 --> 06:12.260
That's like my dream job.

06:12.361 --> 06:14.929
I recommended you,

06:15.030 --> 06:18.032
but it would be awkward if
we weren't really friends.

06:21.036 --> 06:22.537
Why wouldn't we be friends?

06:22.638 --> 06:24.206
We are totally friends.

06:24.307 --> 06:26.708
Look at us just sitting here being friends.

06:28.978 --> 06:30.212
Okay, man, we lucked out.

06:30.313 --> 06:31.679
It's rush week,

06:31.780 --> 06:32.947
and they're having a pledge party.

06:33.048 --> 06:34.415
Okay, how does this sound?

06:34.516 --> 06:36.217
Hey, bros. You wanna
suck down some beer balls

06:36.318 --> 06:37.551
and kappa gamma some chicks?

06:39.254 --> 06:41.188
Ben...

06:41.289 --> 06:44.058
You are about to enter
a secret society, okay?

06:44.159 --> 06:45.526
We have to blend in.

06:45.628 --> 06:47.061
You know, make up new names for boobs,

06:47.162 --> 06:48.529
call everything "puppy."

06:48.631 --> 06:50.464
Like "let's chug this puppy,"

06:50.565 --> 06:54.134
or "dude, last night I
puked all over this puppy."

06:54.235 --> 06:55.869
Get it?

06:55.970 --> 06:58.271
I got you, puppy.

07:01.308 --> 07:02.643
Yeah, you don't get it.

07:10.852 --> 07:13.519
Looks like someone ran over this puppy.

07:13.620 --> 07:15.755
- Now you get it.
- Okay.

07:15.856 --> 07:19.191
Hey, guys.

07:19.292 --> 07:20.325
Welcome

07:20.426 --> 07:23.663
to the sigma beta kappa pledge party.

07:23.764 --> 07:26.532
I am the cool, yet still approachable

07:26.633 --> 07:28.000
chapter president Todd.

07:28.101 --> 07:29.268
How's it going?

07:29.369 --> 07:31.870
It's gonna be a great party, guys.

07:31.971 --> 07:34.072
Listen, we're looking for a
fraternity with a recently acquired

07:34.173 --> 07:35.406
foosball table.

07:35.507 --> 07:38.509
Have you been beaten up
by any guys like that?

07:38.610 --> 07:41.212
All the time.

07:41.313 --> 07:43.514
But we actually just got our own.

07:43.615 --> 07:44.783
See, Alfred?

07:44.884 --> 07:47.052
I told you a foosball table
was a better investment

07:47.153 --> 07:48.619
than strippers.

07:49.822 --> 07:51.589
You were right.

07:51.690 --> 07:56.093
Plus, we got to meet that
hot cougar lady, Bonnie.

07:59.298 --> 08:01.865
Okay, well, I'm Ben and this is Tucker.

08:01.966 --> 08:03.133
We were just hoping to have some beers

08:03.235 --> 08:04.168
and play some foosball.

08:04.269 --> 08:05.469
Oh, sorry, guys.

08:05.571 --> 08:07.672
We keep that puppy locked up.

08:08.973 --> 08:11.108
- See? Told you.
- Yeah.

08:11.209 --> 08:12.442
Only brothers allowed,

08:12.543 --> 08:13.877
but as soon as you pledge,

08:13.978 --> 08:17.647
you'll be on your way to an
all-access pass to friendship.

08:21.619 --> 08:23.187
Um, yeah, no no no.

08:23.287 --> 08:24.855
We're not pledging.

08:26.858 --> 08:29.860
Then I'm afraid we're gonna
have to ask you to leave.

08:29.961 --> 08:31.293
Please?

08:33.030 --> 08:34.330
Oh, no no no. He meant we're not

08:34.431 --> 08:36.498
pledging for any other
fraternities but yours.

08:36.600 --> 08:38.234
We're in.

08:38.335 --> 08:39.400
Let's pledge this puppy!

08:39.501 --> 08:41.037
Okay, now you're just showing off!

08:48.349 --> 08:49.949
Oh, hey, Danny.

08:50.050 --> 08:51.184
Oh. Hey, Mom.

08:51.285 --> 08:52.952
Honey, help me, all right?

08:53.053 --> 08:54.921
I baby-proofed myself out here.

08:55.022 --> 08:56.623
I didn't hear a "please."

08:58.292 --> 09:01.027
I think I'm ready to
face the walk of shame.

09:01.128 --> 09:02.762
I don't know why people call it that.

09:02.863 --> 09:05.198
I'm always like, "hey,
look at me! I just had sex."

09:05.299 --> 09:08.101
Well, I want to get out of
here before anyone sees me.

09:09.737 --> 09:10.870
Too late.

09:10.971 --> 09:13.272
Hey, Georgie, can I get a little help here?

09:13.373 --> 09:15.374
Bro, we just have to
break into the chapter room

09:15.475 --> 09:17.476
and steal my table back.
Hey, what's up, Mom?

09:19.012 --> 09:21.380
Ben, being a pledge
means being hazed, okay?

09:21.481 --> 09:23.449
Being hazed means doing things.

09:23.550 --> 09:25.584
Scary things. Gross things.

09:25.685 --> 09:28.254
Things that may make you question
your sexuality years later.

09:29.656 --> 09:32.023
Well, I don't care.
We're doing it for Emma.

09:32.125 --> 09:34.560
Should we rescue your mom?

09:34.661 --> 09:36.027
Ehh.

09:36.129 --> 09:38.897
We could, but then she'd
never learn her lesson.

09:38.998 --> 09:41.066
Remember that one, Mom?

09:43.002 --> 09:44.970
I'm gonna kill you.

09:46.172 --> 09:47.740
Oh, that's the office.

09:47.840 --> 09:50.241
- I'm gonna take this outside.
- Okay.

09:50.342 --> 09:52.910
Oh my God, get ready to
meet the new in-house counsel

09:53.011 --> 09:54.379
for "Vogue" magazine.

09:54.480 --> 09:55.913
Thanks to your amazing girlfriend,

09:56.014 --> 09:57.315
who I love, I just had one of

09:57.416 --> 09:58.983
the best interviews of my life.

09:59.084 --> 10:01.152
Hey, that's great, Riles.

10:01.253 --> 10:02.787
Way to break that glass ceiling.

10:02.888 --> 10:06.824
How about you come over here
and break this glass window?

10:06.925 --> 10:08.592
Mom trapped herself out on the fire escape.

10:08.693 --> 10:09.960
Have you learned from your mistakes

10:10.061 --> 10:11.728
and how you'll do things
differently next time?

10:11.830 --> 10:13.697
I'm gonna kill you.

10:13.799 --> 10:16.967
Ooh, that sounds like
another 10 minutes to me.

10:18.270 --> 10:19.770
Hey, if you want to go
say thank you to Georgie,

10:19.871 --> 10:21.038
she's on the fire escape.

10:21.139 --> 10:22.506
I've got a team meeting,
but I'm really glad

10:22.607 --> 10:23.507
you guys are getting along.

10:23.608 --> 10:25.276
Yeah.

10:26.678 --> 10:30.213
Could someone at least turn on the TV?

10:30.315 --> 10:33.216
Thank you so much for giving
that fake interview to Riley.

10:33.318 --> 10:35.752
She'll never know that job doesn't exist.

10:35.853 --> 10:38.988
Uh, I think she knows.

10:39.089 --> 10:40.357
Riley.

10:40.458 --> 10:41.558
I can explain.

10:41.659 --> 10:42.959
Okay.

10:43.060 --> 10:44.761
But I'm gonna be listening for the phrase

10:44.862 --> 10:46.896
"I'm a bitch."

10:47.998 --> 10:49.665
So maybe I can't explain.

10:49.766 --> 10:51.434
Why would you get my hopes up for a job

10:51.535 --> 10:53.102
that doesn't even exist?

10:53.204 --> 10:54.304
I'm sorry.

10:54.404 --> 10:56.239
I was just trying to get you to like me.

10:56.340 --> 10:58.574
Oh. Oh my God, is that it?

10:58.675 --> 11:00.243
Oh, well, we should just hug,

11:00.344 --> 11:01.577
or braid each other's hair,

11:01.678 --> 11:03.046
or throw each other off the roof.

11:03.147 --> 11:05.448
I'll start.

11:06.851 --> 11:09.285
Is there any way you could
maybe not mention this to Danny?

11:09.386 --> 11:11.220
Mention it?

11:11.321 --> 11:13.556
I am going to turn it into a play

11:13.657 --> 11:16.425
and then perform it for him.

11:16.526 --> 11:18.561
It's called "I told you so."

11:18.662 --> 11:19.962
So if you'll excuse me

11:20.063 --> 11:21.330
I'm gonna go high five myself.

11:21.431 --> 11:22.732
Okay.

11:24.334 --> 11:26.502
Damn it, they really do keep it locked up.

11:26.603 --> 11:28.237
Oh, here they come. Abort abort.

11:30.005 --> 11:32.173
Pledges, step forward

11:32.274 --> 11:34.376
and prepare to be marked for life.

11:34.477 --> 11:35.777
Bear your arms.

11:35.878 --> 11:37.445
Oh, I was afraid of this.

11:37.546 --> 11:39.213
Branding.

11:39.314 --> 11:40.882
Branding?

11:40.983 --> 11:43.117
Like cattle?

11:44.319 --> 11:46.220
Nope. Tattooed.

11:46.321 --> 11:47.655
Like a badass.

11:49.524 --> 11:51.225
Seriously?!

11:51.326 --> 11:52.559
That's it?

11:52.660 --> 11:55.562
Dude, you're supposed to
make us do naked push-ups,

11:55.663 --> 11:57.498
give us humiliating nicknames,

11:57.599 --> 11:59.300
blindfold us and drop us off in the woods

11:59.401 --> 12:00.634
with a match and a toenail clipper.

12:00.735 --> 12:02.370
I barely survived out there, man!

12:02.470 --> 12:04.471
Why would we do that?

12:04.572 --> 12:06.440
Because we're pledges.

12:06.541 --> 12:07.808
It's what you're supposed to do.

12:07.910 --> 12:09.510
Here's an idea.

12:09.611 --> 12:11.512
Maybe we can clean the
floors using toothbrushes

12:11.613 --> 12:13.580
while you guys go out and party?

12:13.681 --> 12:15.382
Or to the library, your choice.

12:16.684 --> 12:18.585
- You'd really do that?
- Yeah, you bet.

12:18.686 --> 12:20.220
That's just how much we want to be here.

12:20.321 --> 12:22.055
New plan.

12:22.156 --> 12:24.391
I decree the pledges clean the house

12:24.492 --> 12:25.893
with toothbrushes.

12:25.993 --> 12:27.994
Brothers, get them your toothbrushes.

12:29.696 --> 12:30.696
Wait...

12:30.798 --> 12:32.265
But if you leave,

12:32.366 --> 12:35.135
how will you know we'll
stay and do the work?

12:36.804 --> 12:38.604
Excellent point.

12:38.705 --> 12:40.006
Remove your pants.

12:40.107 --> 12:41.441
There you go.

12:45.779 --> 12:47.580
Good work, brother Tucker.

12:52.018 --> 12:53.653
Oh, Danny Danny Danny.

12:53.754 --> 12:56.589
Do I have a story for you, all right?

12:56.690 --> 12:58.724
Curtain rises on a beautiful girl.

12:58.826 --> 13:00.927
Let's call her Riley.

13:01.027 --> 13:04.363
The evil ice queen, let's
call her your girlfriend...

13:04.465 --> 13:06.966
She's not my girlfriend. I
just got off the phone with her.

13:07.067 --> 13:09.601
Damn it. She told you?

13:09.702 --> 13:11.269
I wanted to be the one to tell you.

13:11.370 --> 13:12.871
Can I still tell you?

13:12.972 --> 13:13.939
Why would you want to tell me

13:14.039 --> 13:15.106
that she was breaking up with me?

13:15.207 --> 13:16.741
You mean you're breaking up with her.

13:16.843 --> 13:18.844
No. Why would I break up with her?

13:18.945 --> 13:20.411
I was falling in love with her.

13:22.348 --> 13:23.915
- You were?
- Yeah.

13:24.016 --> 13:26.084
I thought she was falling in love with me.

13:27.419 --> 13:28.586
You did?

13:28.687 --> 13:30.121
I just never had feelings like that really

13:30.222 --> 13:32.256
except for you...

13:32.358 --> 13:34.292
You know, no one.

13:34.393 --> 13:36.594
Well...

13:36.695 --> 13:38.363
What exactly did she tell you?

13:38.464 --> 13:39.930
Just that it was too hard.

13:40.032 --> 13:41.732
That she could see this
was never going to work.

13:41.833 --> 13:43.734
That I had too many
rules, which makes no sense

13:43.835 --> 13:46.436
because I only had the one that
she had to get along with you.

13:48.706 --> 13:49.973
You said that to her?

13:50.074 --> 13:51.074
Yeah.

13:51.175 --> 13:52.575
And now you guys are best friends,

13:52.676 --> 13:54.011
and I just got dumped.

13:56.014 --> 13:58.281
Do you think it'd be weird if I
asked you to stop talking to her?

14:01.019 --> 14:02.419
It's the least I can do.

14:04.000 --> 14:10.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

14:12.578 --> 14:15.978
Dude, I can't believe you couldn't
break in to your own foosball table.

14:15.980 --> 14:17.881
Hey, I called in an expert.

14:17.982 --> 14:19.583
All right, almost there.

14:20.919 --> 14:22.485
Oh, all right.

14:22.587 --> 14:25.823
And here we go. Emma's
college fund is found.

14:27.191 --> 14:30.860
And it's not even enough
to apply to college.

14:32.096 --> 14:33.329
Really, Ben?

14:33.430 --> 14:34.764
A fistful of ones

14:34.865 --> 14:37.533
and an expired sandwich coupon?!

14:37.634 --> 14:39.435
Wow.

14:39.536 --> 14:40.770
You know, now that I think about it,

14:40.871 --> 14:42.605
I only started doing
this a couple weeks ago.

14:43.874 --> 14:45.141
Let's get out of here.

14:45.242 --> 14:46.843
That was super funny.

14:48.244 --> 14:50.345
What the heck is going on here?!

14:50.446 --> 14:54.349
And why is the foosball cougar here?

14:54.450 --> 14:56.351
I knew you'd find me.

14:57.653 --> 14:59.755
Look, here's the truth.

14:59.856 --> 15:01.089
This is my foosball table.

15:01.190 --> 15:02.758
My mom accidentally sold it to you.

15:02.859 --> 15:04.826
It has my daughter's
college fund inside of it.

15:04.927 --> 15:07.095
You have a kid?

15:07.196 --> 15:09.997
What's it like having sex?

15:11.532 --> 15:13.433
Hot... that's not the point.

15:13.534 --> 15:15.770
Look, there no longer is a point, okay?

15:15.871 --> 15:17.671
'Cause there's no money
in there, so we'll see you.

15:17.773 --> 15:19.506
You guys are really leaving?

15:19.607 --> 15:22.442
Oh, hell yes.

15:22.543 --> 15:26.113
I am in my boxers for a fistful of ones.

15:26.214 --> 15:28.347
You might as well start
calling me Cinnamon.

15:31.551 --> 15:34.654
Well, it looks like we're not
gonna be a fraternity anymore.

15:34.755 --> 15:36.522
What are you talking about?

15:36.623 --> 15:39.759
We haven't met our
minimum number of pledges.

15:39.860 --> 15:41.828
We stopped looking after you guys walked in

15:41.929 --> 15:44.097
and pledge week ends tonight.

15:44.198 --> 15:45.165
So it's over

15:45.266 --> 15:46.766
for sigma beta kappa.

15:48.735 --> 15:50.736
Wow, man. That's a really sad story.

15:51.871 --> 15:53.406
Well, good luck.

15:55.776 --> 15:56.909
Mom, you coming?

15:57.010 --> 15:58.477
Yeah yeah, in a minute.

16:01.014 --> 16:02.915
Sorry I can't help you out, Kid.

16:03.016 --> 16:03.982
But...

16:18.865 --> 16:20.765
I mean, Danny would have figured out

16:20.867 --> 16:23.168
what kind of person Georgie
is eventually, right?

16:23.269 --> 16:24.736
Totally. It's good she's gone.

16:26.439 --> 16:28.173
You know what? I couldn't
even pledge if I wanted to,

16:28.274 --> 16:29.473
so I shouldn't feel guilty, right?

16:29.574 --> 16:31.108
Oh my God, no.

16:31.210 --> 16:33.044
You feel guilty when you
break up your best friend's

16:33.145 --> 16:35.779
relationship just to get
even with his girlfriend.

16:35.881 --> 16:37.248
Which I didn't do.

16:37.349 --> 16:38.749
Which is why...

16:38.851 --> 16:41.252
I do not feel guilty.

16:44.522 --> 16:46.891
Hey, delusion one and two.

16:46.992 --> 16:48.492
This just in...

16:48.593 --> 16:51.561
you're both horrible people.

16:51.662 --> 16:53.629
Mom, I had to.

16:53.731 --> 16:55.565
I thought Emma's college fund was at stake.

16:55.666 --> 16:57.567
Well, congratulations, Man.

16:57.668 --> 17:00.237
Your savings plan was about
as lame as that frat house.

17:00.338 --> 17:01.471
Yeah.

17:01.572 --> 17:04.107
If you're trying to make me feel guilty...

17:04.208 --> 17:06.009
It's working.

17:06.109 --> 17:07.143
Look, I mean.. Yeah, sure,

17:07.244 --> 17:08.778
their party skills were pathetic

17:08.878 --> 17:10.880
and the only girl they
could get was your mom.

17:13.782 --> 17:15.084
But...

17:15.185 --> 17:16.952
At least they had each other.

17:17.053 --> 17:19.088
You know what, Tucker? You're right.

17:19.189 --> 17:20.756
You may speak frat,

17:20.857 --> 17:23.723
<i>but I parlez vous partay.</i>

17:23.993 --> 17:25.361
Let's go help those nerds.

17:25.461 --> 17:26.795
Who's with me?

17:28.231 --> 17:29.764
Really?

17:30.866 --> 17:32.566
I just called Georgie's office.

17:32.667 --> 17:35.236
She's actually flying home to London.

17:35.337 --> 17:38.439
I drove her out of the country.

17:38.540 --> 17:41.642
Can we at least acknowledge
how impressive that is?

17:45.714 --> 17:46.614
Georgie!

17:46.715 --> 17:48.282
Georgie, wait!

17:48.383 --> 17:49.749
Riley?

17:49.850 --> 17:51.051
Excuse me, pardon me.

17:51.152 --> 17:52.752
Sorry. What are you doing here?

17:52.853 --> 17:53.787
How did you even get in?

17:53.888 --> 17:55.289
Not easy.

17:55.390 --> 17:57.757
Security had no sense of romance.

17:57.858 --> 17:59.559
Finally had to buy a ticket.

17:59.660 --> 18:01.094
- To London?
- Newark.

18:01.195 --> 18:03.496
It's the London of New Jersey.

18:04.565 --> 18:06.766
I can't let you do this.

18:06.867 --> 18:10.136
Okay? I can't let you walk
away from this relationship.

18:10.237 --> 18:11.304
I don't think I have a choice.

18:11.405 --> 18:12.571
You do.

18:12.672 --> 18:14.240
You do have a choice.

18:14.341 --> 18:16.442
All right, 'cause you can get on that plane

18:16.543 --> 18:20.079
and fly away from possibly the best
thing that ever happened to you,

18:20.180 --> 18:22.381
or you can come back with me

18:22.482 --> 18:24.550
and say yes.

18:24.651 --> 18:26.018
Say yes to love.

18:26.119 --> 18:27.719
Nothing will change between us.

18:27.821 --> 18:29.087
It will. It will change.

18:29.188 --> 18:31.022
That's what I'm saying. It'll be different.

18:31.123 --> 18:32.958
I promise.

18:33.059 --> 18:35.093
You and me...

18:35.194 --> 18:36.594
we'll start over.

18:36.695 --> 18:38.229
Really?

18:38.331 --> 18:39.965
Really.

18:46.538 --> 18:47.772
Oh, we're not...

18:48.873 --> 18:49.974
You know what? Never mind.

18:51.209 --> 18:53.143
Well, I guess you don't have to

18:53.244 --> 18:54.911
leave the country for good now.

18:55.013 --> 18:57.081
Leave the country?

18:57.182 --> 19:00.284
It's a two-day trip to
London for the magazine.

19:00.385 --> 19:02.752
I had postponed it for Danny's banquet.

19:03.855 --> 19:05.622
Well, you might want to have a little chat

19:05.723 --> 19:07.857
with your assistant.
She can be kind of vague.

19:14.531 --> 19:16.799
Looks like these guys
are finally catching on.

19:16.900 --> 19:19.102
Dude, I just found a goat
in one of the bedrooms

19:19.203 --> 19:21.104
and a pledge glued to the ceiling.

19:22.873 --> 19:24.773
I couldn't be prouder.

19:24.875 --> 19:26.941
Hey, when you're blessed
with so much coolness,

19:27.043 --> 19:28.743
sometimes it just feels good to give back.

19:30.179 --> 19:32.547
Hey, guys!

19:34.884 --> 19:37.752
We've recruited enough
pledges to save the house.

19:37.853 --> 19:38.820
I can't thank you enough.

19:38.921 --> 19:39.954
Hey, you're welcome.

19:40.056 --> 19:41.423
And if I ever get around
to going to college,

19:41.524 --> 19:43.958
I will definitely pledge here...

19:44.060 --> 19:46.093
If none of the cool houses will have me.

19:46.194 --> 19:48.362
Well, if you will excuse me,

19:48.463 --> 19:50.297
I have to go show brother Todd here

19:50.399 --> 19:52.966
how he can use his high
G.P.A. To get a cheerleader.

19:54.403 --> 19:56.137
It's mathematically possible.

19:58.206 --> 19:59.206
Oh, hey, Danny.

19:59.307 --> 20:00.408
You and the team really came through.

20:00.509 --> 20:01.409
I appreciate it.

20:01.510 --> 20:02.743
What can I say?

20:02.844 --> 20:04.011
The guys respond well to the words

20:04.111 --> 20:06.413
"free beer and college girls."

20:06.514 --> 20:08.281
Now if I can just get
Georgie out of my head,

20:08.382 --> 20:10.016
then I might actually enjoy myself.

20:10.117 --> 20:12.152
Or maybe if you actually saw her,

20:12.253 --> 20:13.186
it would be even better.

20:13.287 --> 20:14.754
Hey.

20:14.855 --> 20:16.756
Look who I ran into randomly

20:16.857 --> 20:17.890
doing nothing,

20:17.991 --> 20:19.892
going nowhere.

20:21.028 --> 20:23.262
So what have I missed?

20:23.363 --> 20:24.430
Besides you.

20:28.868 --> 20:30.436
Nicely done.

20:30.537 --> 20:33.072
So, you still think we're horrible people?

20:33.173 --> 20:36.408
Horrible people who can sleep tonight.

20:36.509 --> 20:38.743
Together?

20:38.844 --> 20:40.179
Not a chance.

20:41.747 --> 20:43.747
Honey.

20:43.749 --> 20:46.149
Bonnie, delta baba ghanonous.

20:47.250 --> 20:48.984
I'm a student, you're a student.

20:49.086 --> 20:51.553
Want to form a student union?

20:54.424 --> 20:56.325
Aah! Oh my God. Hi, there.

20:56.426 --> 20:58.227
Don't we have chemistry together?

20:58.328 --> 21:00.662
Class and the other kind?

21:00.764 --> 21:02.363
Want to form a compound?

21:05.400 --> 21:07.435
Hi, Bonnie Wheeler.

21:07.536 --> 21:09.303
Divorced 40-something mother of two

21:09.404 --> 21:11.572
with a granddaughter and even
a grander sense of adventure.

21:11.673 --> 21:12.673
Can you deal with that?

21:13.876 --> 21:15.409
All right. Buckle up, peaches.
