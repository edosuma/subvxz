WEBVTT

00:01.242 --> 00:02.991
Previously on Hawaii Five-O...

00:03.016 --> 00:05.070
- I love Masuda-San.
- I'm sure you did.

00:05.095 --> 00:07.451
Any suggestion I was somehow involved in

00:07.475 --> 00:09.782
- Masuda-san's death?
- Not a suggestion.

00:09.807 --> 00:11.141
Pretty convenient for you

00:11.208 --> 00:12.552
that the only people
who could confirm this

00:12.576 --> 00:13.710
are now dead.

00:13.777 --> 00:15.245
I will make sure the authorities

00:15.312 --> 00:16.880
find out about your role

00:16.947 --> 00:19.015
in everything that took place tonight.

00:19.083 --> 00:20.560
Robbery happened
just a couple hours after

00:20.584 --> 00:22.886
you called in sick, so I
just need you to tell me

00:22.953 --> 00:24.988
that you weren't involved.

00:25.055 --> 00:26.122
Sorry, Steve.

00:29.126 --> 00:30.627
That lady right there,

00:30.701 --> 00:32.402
she returned an Interpol Red Notice.

00:32.463 --> 00:35.143
Her name is Daiyu Mei.

00:35.168 --> 00:37.634
Tell the policemen you have
a message for Steve McGarrett.

00:37.659 --> 00:39.127
She escaped a Chinese prison.

00:39.212 --> 00:42.754
He'll be familiar with
my late husband, Wo Fat.

01:14.267 --> 01:16.000
Set a perimeter. Lock this lobby down.

01:16.025 --> 01:17.716
Nobody in, nobody out.

01:36.943 --> 01:38.492
Five-O! Hands!

01:44.576 --> 01:47.512
All clear!

01:47.537 --> 01:49.605
Same. Clear.

01:49.850 --> 01:52.818
Huh. How 'bout that
for a disappearing act.

01:53.274 --> 01:56.253
Not ten minutes ago, Intel
had our guy right in this room.

01:56.278 --> 01:57.916
Maybe our Intel was bad?

02:16.953 --> 02:18.286
The men you're looking for

02:18.311 --> 02:20.145
just slipped into the adjoining room.

02:20.170 --> 02:21.104
Who is this?

02:21.343 --> 02:22.757
Trust me. They're in there.

02:23.650 --> 02:26.128
You should also know...
they have a hostage.

02:53.070 --> 02:54.871
Oh, my God!

03:01.567 --> 03:03.223
Five-O! Drop your weapons!

03:08.528 --> 03:11.351
Junior, on me. The rest of
you, take the back stairs!

03:26.094 --> 03:27.771
Move! Move! Move!

03:47.199 --> 03:48.133
Freeze!

04:14.885 --> 04:17.019
Down! Everybody down! Now!

04:17.043 --> 04:18.399
Stay down!

04:33.173 --> 04:35.362
Over there!

04:52.126 --> 04:54.597
Be advised, suspect last seen

04:54.622 --> 04:57.180
headed east on Koa. I lost him.

04:59.293 --> 05:00.760
You let him get away?

05:02.833 --> 05:04.275
Who are you?

05:04.513 --> 05:05.947
I'm the guy on the phone.

05:43.750 --> 05:45.094
You're a private eye?

05:45.345 --> 05:47.055
Thomas Magnum. And this is my partner,

05:47.080 --> 05:49.086
Juliet Higgins. And I prefer...

05:49.399 --> 05:52.118
- "private investigator."
- Oh, so you're a creep-and-peep.

05:52.143 --> 05:53.477
Excuse me?

05:53.502 --> 05:55.916
- Same thing.
- So, what exactly

05:55.941 --> 05:57.008
are you investigating?

05:57.033 --> 05:58.795
I'm so sorry, but I'm not sure
that we're going to be inclined

05:58.819 --> 06:00.253
to indulge this rather brusque

06:00.278 --> 06:01.805
line of questioning.

06:01.829 --> 06:04.816
- Oh, you're very English.
- See this little badge here?

06:04.841 --> 06:07.543
This badge says you don't
have a choice in the matter.

06:08.329 --> 06:09.502
McGarrett.

06:10.446 --> 06:12.013
I know that name.

06:12.038 --> 06:13.914
You're a team guy, right?

06:14.391 --> 06:16.151
I was a team guy, too.

06:16.176 --> 06:18.177
- Is that right?
- Well, are you aware

06:18.202 --> 06:19.864
that we can hold this team, too,

06:19.889 --> 06:21.856
for interfering with an investigation?

06:21.881 --> 06:24.368
Maybe. But unless you're
gonna charge us with something,

06:24.393 --> 06:25.760
you're gonna have to let us go.

06:25.871 --> 06:26.904
Well, let's test

06:26.929 --> 06:28.369
that theory then. Go on. Turn around.

06:28.397 --> 06:30.642
Oh, let me guess... you have
a rendition room in the basement

06:30.666 --> 06:31.833
where you'll leverage us

06:31.858 --> 06:32.858
until we cooperate.

06:33.141 --> 06:34.985
- So?
- Hold up a second.

06:35.010 --> 06:36.188
I like this one.

06:36.213 --> 06:37.806
All I'm saying is,

06:37.831 --> 06:40.180
for the record, a simple
"please" would have sufficed.

06:40.205 --> 06:42.544
What exactly are you investigating?

06:42.797 --> 06:44.288
Please.

06:44.313 --> 06:46.347
Okay. We, um...

06:46.372 --> 06:47.539
We're hired on a job.

06:47.564 --> 06:49.427
This woman thought her
husband was cheating on her.

06:49.451 --> 06:51.719
He was staying out late,
taking a lot of business trips,

06:51.744 --> 06:53.411
so we follow the guy.

06:53.564 --> 06:55.232
This is him.

06:55.257 --> 06:56.524
Daniel Hong.

06:56.592 --> 06:58.059
Pharmaceutical rep.

06:58.084 --> 06:59.566
Wait a minute, so the dead guy who just

06:59.591 --> 07:01.122
shot at us, that's
your client's husband?

07:01.147 --> 07:03.255
Yeah. Believe me,
we were as astonished as you are.

07:03.280 --> 07:05.043
Anyway, he gets a room at this hotel,

07:05.067 --> 07:06.845
and we assume he was
gonna meet a woman there.

07:06.869 --> 07:09.388
So we set up shop next
door with a camera.

07:11.294 --> 07:13.484
But instead of being visited by a woman,

07:13.509 --> 07:15.643
Hong greeted a gentleman.

07:15.668 --> 07:16.968
So there we are,

07:16.993 --> 07:18.923
thinking, "Okay, this woman
doesn't know her husband

07:18.948 --> 07:20.481
as well as she thinks she does."

07:20.506 --> 07:22.808
But, alas, nothing more occurred.

07:22.833 --> 07:24.696
Then Hong handed off a
small envelope to the man.

07:24.720 --> 07:25.840
And then they just sat there

07:25.865 --> 07:27.646
and had a rather polite conversation.

07:27.671 --> 07:29.601
Well, that is, until
you guys showed up...

07:29.625 --> 07:31.644
when, uh, Hong's associate

07:31.669 --> 07:33.370
gets a call on his phone

07:33.395 --> 07:34.773
and they draw their
weapons and then break

07:34.798 --> 07:36.332
into the room next door.

07:38.176 --> 07:40.077
Well, I guess
philandering would've been

07:40.102 --> 07:41.936
a step up from whatever this guy's into.

07:42.004 --> 07:43.404
So Hong's visitor must've had

07:43.429 --> 07:45.297
somebody posted outside there somewhere

07:45.322 --> 07:47.157
to let 'em know when
people were coming up.

07:47.351 --> 07:48.385
All right.

07:48.410 --> 07:50.612
Your turn to divulge.

07:50.637 --> 07:52.862
Yeah, I mean, we cooperated.

07:52.887 --> 07:54.482
Told you everything we know.

07:54.593 --> 07:56.794
A little reciprocity's
in order, I think.

07:56.819 --> 07:58.253
Please.

08:01.200 --> 08:03.992
The man that was with Hong
is an associate of a woman

08:04.017 --> 08:05.312
by the name of Daiyu Mei.

08:05.337 --> 08:06.604
Who's that?

08:06.629 --> 08:08.963
She's a Chinese national
that recently arrived

08:08.988 --> 08:12.176
in Hawaii after escaping
from Qincheng Prison.

08:12.201 --> 08:13.747
We think that she's here

08:13.772 --> 08:16.938
to reestablish the operation
of her deceased husband,

08:16.963 --> 08:20.484
- arms trafficker Wo Fat.
- Wo Fat.

08:20.509 --> 08:21.820
Why doesn't somebody else say his name.

08:21.844 --> 08:23.513
Maybe he'll pop up like Beetlejuice.

08:23.538 --> 08:24.575
You know who this guy is?

08:24.600 --> 08:26.124
Yeah, he was on an MI6 watch list.

08:26.802 --> 08:28.549
How would you know that?

08:28.574 --> 08:29.774
She's an ex-spy.

08:30.010 --> 08:32.245
Very cool. I like that.

08:33.716 --> 08:34.923
So, as far as we were aware,

08:34.948 --> 08:36.414
Wo Fat mainly operates

08:36.440 --> 08:37.621
in the Southeast theater,

08:37.647 --> 08:40.203
with a couple of financial
investments in Europe.

08:40.229 --> 08:41.796
Yeah, well, a bullet to the head

08:41.821 --> 08:44.441
stopped him from making any
profits on those transactions.

08:44.466 --> 08:46.844
We got a tip that Daiyu
Mei was sending somebody here

08:46.869 --> 08:48.847
for a meeting. We were
hoping to be able to flip him

08:48.871 --> 08:50.448
for information on
where her location is.

08:50.472 --> 08:51.783
And that's clearly not gonna work,

08:51.807 --> 08:53.251
because we don't even
know what he looks like,

08:53.276 --> 08:54.410
let alone have an I.D.

08:54.435 --> 08:56.419
Hold on. You don't
know what he looks like?

08:56.444 --> 08:57.911
How is that even possible?

08:57.936 --> 09:00.091
Uh, the specifics were a little hazy

09:00.116 --> 09:02.404
'cause of all the bullets
flying around our heads.

09:02.429 --> 09:05.262
Fair enough. You might not
know what he looks like,

09:05.287 --> 09:06.654
- but we do.
- Oh, yeah.

09:06.679 --> 09:08.824
You had a camera set up. We're
gonna need to see those pictures.

09:08.891 --> 09:12.160
Uh, that's gonna be a bit of a problem.

09:12.227 --> 09:14.329
Unfortunately, Thomas here
made a bit of a pig's ear

09:14.354 --> 09:15.638
- of that one.
- I did? Me?

09:15.663 --> 09:16.761
It was your camera.

09:16.786 --> 09:18.475
How was I supposed to know
the SD card was corrupted?

09:18.500 --> 09:20.435
Gee, good question. I don't know.

09:20.460 --> 09:22.654
Perhaps by checking it. Sorry,

09:22.679 --> 09:24.631
when it comes to technology,
he's a total numpty.

09:24.656 --> 09:27.491
- Okay.
- Back the truck up.

09:27.516 --> 09:29.510
Are you two saying you
don't have the pictures?

09:29.911 --> 09:31.255
- Correct.
- That's right.

09:31.280 --> 09:32.480
Well,

09:32.505 --> 09:34.739
a description is better than nothing.

09:34.764 --> 09:36.361
Well, I guess
they can help us get

09:36.385 --> 09:38.029
some kind of a composite
drawing going then.

09:38.053 --> 09:39.854
Do me a favor. Reach
out to your boy at CSU.

09:39.879 --> 09:42.080
Have him send a sketch
artist to sit with these guys.

09:42.105 --> 09:45.208
- Let's go. You're coming with us.
- Hold on, hold on.

09:45.526 --> 09:47.561
Uh, we're working a case here, too.

09:48.693 --> 09:50.294
Where?

09:50.693 --> 09:52.886
- Your subject's dead.
- Dead.

09:52.935 --> 09:56.738
Look, you guys are our only
witnesses, okay? We need your help.

09:56.763 --> 09:58.274
And I'm pretty sure you
want to get your hands

09:58.299 --> 09:59.633
on the man responsible

09:59.658 --> 10:01.325
for getting your
client's husband killed.

10:02.444 --> 10:04.318
- We do.
- Okay, great, then it's settled.

10:04.343 --> 10:06.144
We're working together.

10:11.872 --> 10:13.480
I guess we're working together.

10:27.469 --> 10:29.737
Now, this is a proper setup.

10:29.797 --> 10:32.065
Come on, it's just a bigger laptop.

10:32.176 --> 10:34.410
Hey. How'd it go?

10:34.478 --> 10:35.778
Good, good. Thomas and Juliet

10:35.803 --> 10:38.405
spoke to the composite artist,
and their description

10:38.472 --> 10:39.583
of the suspect was mostly consistent.

10:40.070 --> 10:41.757
Running facial rec now.

10:41.782 --> 10:43.734
I still think his chin
was a little longer.

10:43.759 --> 10:46.394
Okay, well, I'm about to
prove you wrong. Observe.

10:47.711 --> 10:48.788
And no hits. He's not

10:48.820 --> 10:50.021
- in the system.
- Okay.

10:50.046 --> 10:52.948
That's disappointing. But
not entirely unsurprising.

10:52.973 --> 10:54.927
Look, if you want to find this guy,

10:54.952 --> 10:56.986
you're gonna have to do
it the old-fashioned way.

10:57.011 --> 10:59.907
These fancy computers can't
compete with strong intuition.

10:59.932 --> 11:02.801
He's just trying to impress
you. Every opportunity he gets,

11:02.826 --> 11:04.193
he asks me to reach for my laptop

11:04.218 --> 11:06.496
- in search of a break.
- Okay, well, I think we should

11:06.521 --> 11:09.090
probably go with our
strongest lead, and right now

11:09.115 --> 11:10.626
that is your client's
husband, Daniel Hong.

11:10.651 --> 11:12.362
- You've been to his house, I presume?
- Sure. Mm-hmm.

11:12.387 --> 11:14.079
All right, Mr. Private Investigator.

11:14.104 --> 11:15.938
You're with me. In the
meantime, your client

11:15.963 --> 11:17.992
is up at the M.E.'s
office I.D.'ing the body.

11:18.017 --> 11:19.551
So, Tani, why don't you go check in

11:19.576 --> 11:21.077
with her. I will have Lou

11:21.102 --> 11:22.512
look into Hong's employer, all right?

11:22.579 --> 11:26.390
Great. And, uh, Higgins,
you should probably go

11:26.415 --> 11:28.718
with Tani and-and do some stuff, too.

11:28.743 --> 11:30.703
Thanks, Magnum. I can set my own tasks.

11:31.398 --> 11:33.065
- Cool.
- So, I have

11:33.090 --> 11:34.467
a rather good rapport with Mrs. Hong.

11:34.491 --> 11:35.835
I could come with you, if you'd like?

11:35.859 --> 11:37.337
Yeah, actually. That
would be really helpful.

11:37.361 --> 11:38.628
- Thank you.
- Great.

11:53.023 --> 11:54.396
Is there a problem?

11:54.421 --> 11:56.355
Uh, you mean, other than the fact

11:56.380 --> 11:58.781
that I'm a passenger in my own car? No.

11:58.849 --> 12:00.750
Oh, no, I just... I-I like to drive.

12:00.775 --> 12:03.643
- It's kind of my thing.
- Well, this car is kind of my thing

12:03.668 --> 12:05.702
being that it belongs to me.

12:05.727 --> 12:08.362
But it doesn't matter whose
car it is. I drive. Always.

12:08.387 --> 12:11.303
Kind of like a Rain Man
situation? It's fine.

12:11.328 --> 12:13.629
Don't worry about it. You're...
you're a wonderful driver.

12:13.654 --> 12:15.192
- Making fun of me now?
- For control issues?

12:15.217 --> 12:17.068
No, I would never do that. It'd be rude.

12:17.093 --> 12:18.992
Look, I like to
drive, that's all.

12:19.079 --> 12:21.380
- I'm sure your partner loves that.
- He's fine with it.

12:21.405 --> 12:23.673
I have a sneaking suspicion he's not.

12:24.751 --> 12:26.819
Let me ask you a question.

12:26.844 --> 12:29.412
How does a P.I. afford a Ferrari?

12:30.218 --> 12:32.014
Okay. All right, you got me.

12:32.082 --> 12:34.035
It's not technically my car.

12:34.060 --> 12:37.586
I do consulting work for Robin Masters,
and... he lets me drive his car.

12:37.611 --> 12:40.089
Robin Masters, the author Robin Masters?

12:40.114 --> 12:41.614
Yeah. You a fan?

12:41.725 --> 12:42.992
I mean, I've read a couple

12:43.017 --> 12:45.209
of the White Knight books.
They're entertaining.

12:45.234 --> 12:47.539
Not exactly realistic, though.

12:48.140 --> 12:49.732
There's no way a character that cocky

12:49.800 --> 12:52.007
would ever, ever make it through BUD/S.

12:52.273 --> 12:54.504
Really? See, that's funny,

12:54.529 --> 12:56.764
because, uh, Robin was
embedded with my team

12:56.789 --> 12:58.556
when he was researching his first book.

12:59.523 --> 13:00.987
You're saying you're the White Knight?

13:01.012 --> 13:02.379
Well, that is classified.

13:02.404 --> 13:04.080
But I will say that the lead character

13:04.105 --> 13:07.640
is based on a heroic,
charismatic individual

13:07.665 --> 13:09.194
who will do anything
to get the job done.

13:09.219 --> 13:11.120
Ah, got it. Okay.

13:11.231 --> 13:12.831
So it's not based on you.

13:12.856 --> 13:15.015
Well, hold on. I'm not saying
it's not based on me.

13:15.040 --> 13:16.476
No. What you are saying
is that it's possible

13:16.501 --> 13:18.438
I'm in the presence
of greatness right now.

13:18.462 --> 13:21.242
Okay. Nice save.

13:25.601 --> 13:27.601
_

13:35.905 --> 13:37.256
I woke up

13:37.281 --> 13:40.202
this morning thinking I
might have to start looking

13:40.227 --> 13:41.861
for a divorce lawyer.

13:42.460 --> 13:44.363
Wondering what my life would be like

13:44.388 --> 13:46.689
without Daniel in it, and...

13:47.030 --> 13:49.031
now this happens.

13:51.837 --> 13:53.238
Erin, when you hired us,

13:53.263 --> 13:55.498
you said that Daniel
was acting suspiciously?

13:55.819 --> 13:56.952
Yeah.

13:57.351 --> 13:58.901
He always traveled for work,

13:58.969 --> 14:01.204
but lately, the trips
had become more frequent.

14:01.314 --> 14:03.694
I can see why you would think that.

14:03.719 --> 14:05.468
But based on everything we know,

14:05.493 --> 14:07.678
it's clear that your husband
was not having an affair.

14:08.460 --> 14:10.343
We do think he was involved

14:10.368 --> 14:11.794
with some very dangerous people.

14:12.692 --> 14:15.171
Do you recognize this man?

14:16.149 --> 14:17.783
No. Sorry.

14:18.507 --> 14:20.299
And in terms of travel,

14:20.644 --> 14:24.380
could you tell us the last
few cities that Daniel visited?

14:25.138 --> 14:28.296
Last week, he was in Portland and L.A.

14:28.782 --> 14:31.217
Before that, it was Denver.

14:32.369 --> 14:33.851
What?

14:35.202 --> 14:37.506
We looked into your
husband's travel records.

14:37.858 --> 14:41.019
In the last two months,
he made nine trips.

14:41.387 --> 14:43.522
All to China.

15:09.217 --> 15:10.247
Hey, Tani. What's up?

15:10.272 --> 15:12.116
Hey. We just finished
talking to the wife.

15:12.141 --> 15:13.652
All right, good. We
just got to the house.

15:13.753 --> 15:15.787
Okay, nice. Mrs. Hong is still here.

15:15.812 --> 15:17.146
Noelani's got her doing paperwork.

15:17.171 --> 15:18.888
We'll hold her here as long as we can.

15:19.126 --> 15:21.194
All right, copy that. Talk
to you in a little bit.

15:24.943 --> 15:27.277
What do you think? Gonna get lucky?

15:28.902 --> 15:31.827
No key.

15:31.894 --> 15:35.131
- All right. I'll take the back door.
- Don't worry about it. I got it.

15:35.241 --> 15:38.734
- You, uh, you got it, you said?
- Yeah, I got it.

15:41.521 --> 15:44.006
Okay. Is this... is this a thing?

15:44.190 --> 15:46.691
- You do this often?
- No, only when I have to.

15:51.515 --> 15:53.302
Come on, you telling me
you never break the rules?

15:53.335 --> 15:55.880
I didn't say I don't break the rules,
but I got a badge that says

15:55.905 --> 15:57.272
- I can.
- Perfect.

15:57.341 --> 15:59.488
That means if, uh, we get caught,

15:59.513 --> 16:00.913
you can do the explaining.

16:02.009 --> 16:03.693
After you.

16:05.228 --> 16:07.248
Okay, so, just so I'm clear,

16:07.273 --> 16:08.640
breaking into people's homes

16:08.665 --> 16:11.834
is or is not a regular part of your job?

16:11.859 --> 16:13.411
Only when it's required.

16:13.436 --> 16:15.280
You know, honestly, I
should charge extra for it.

16:15.305 --> 16:16.906
Call it hazard pay.

16:17.015 --> 16:18.116
Guy with your skill set,

16:18.141 --> 16:19.485
you should consider law enforcement.

16:19.509 --> 16:21.043
Eh, the hours don't suit me.

16:21.111 --> 16:23.245
I'm more of a "improvise as you go,"

16:23.270 --> 16:25.451
not necessarily a
by-the-book rule follower.

16:25.476 --> 16:28.311
Huh. That's never stopped me.

17:02.853 --> 17:04.561
What, are you looking for a snack?

17:05.064 --> 17:07.098
No, the fridge is running loud,

17:07.124 --> 17:09.916
like the condenser's
working too hard.

17:12.055 --> 17:14.522
Sounds like something's
blocking the airflow.

17:24.094 --> 17:26.776
- Nice find.
- Oh, look at that!

17:26.800 --> 17:29.069
Old school works every time.

17:29.312 --> 17:31.980
Except it's in Chinese.

17:33.047 --> 17:35.360
Which, apparently, you know how to read.

17:35.385 --> 17:37.586
Our vic's wife should be
getting back any minute.

17:37.611 --> 17:39.045
Let's take that to go.

17:39.070 --> 17:40.570
Come on.

17:50.312 --> 17:53.436
Uh... Home security?

17:53.510 --> 17:55.905
- Look, we were just leaving.
- Take his gun.

17:55.972 --> 17:57.869
Remove the mag. Clear the chamber.

17:57.894 --> 18:01.306
Then toss it. Now.

18:09.523 --> 18:11.624
Easy. Done.

18:12.722 --> 18:14.190
Now give me the folder.

18:14.257 --> 18:16.169
Oh, come on, man.
You took his gun already.

18:16.194 --> 18:17.494
Let us keep something.

18:17.727 --> 18:19.762
Now or I shoot your chatty friend.

18:19.830 --> 18:21.329
Him?

18:21.362 --> 18:23.587
He's not my friend. I
barely know this guy.

18:23.612 --> 18:25.324
- I met this guy today.
- That's not true.

18:25.348 --> 18:26.788
Honestly we're pals,

18:26.813 --> 18:28.751
- known each other for years
- Met him today.

18:28.776 --> 18:31.212
I could just err on the
safe side and shoot you both.

18:32.022 --> 18:34.023
Relax, all right?

18:41.733 --> 18:44.298
Come on, man! Those tires are $800!

18:45.980 --> 18:47.290
Each!

18:55.975 --> 18:58.601
Who the hell was that?

19:00.680 --> 19:02.274
I don't know. But on the plus side,

19:02.299 --> 19:03.943
technically, that's not your car.

19:06.877 --> 19:08.043
That's not a plus.

19:13.008 --> 19:15.717
Okay, this is, like, the
most boring reality show

19:15.742 --> 19:16.742
I've ever seen.

19:16.767 --> 19:18.735
There's 32 cameras in this hotel,

19:18.760 --> 19:20.070
and I haven't seen a single cat-fight.

19:20.095 --> 19:22.374
And, more pertinently,
there's just no sign

19:22.399 --> 19:24.434
of Hong or the fellow he met with.

19:25.914 --> 19:27.629
Well, Junior and Quinn

19:27.654 --> 19:29.922
look bored to tears, so
I'm guessing they're having

19:29.947 --> 19:32.215
about the same amount
of luck that we are.

19:32.476 --> 19:33.735
Well, at least with the four of us,

19:33.760 --> 19:35.127
we'll make light work of it.

19:37.656 --> 19:39.074
You all seem pretty well-drilled.

19:39.609 --> 19:41.677
There's none of that
counterproductive dysfunction

19:41.702 --> 19:43.847
you usually encounter in
office environments like this.

19:43.906 --> 19:46.763
Totally. We're very functional.

19:46.796 --> 19:49.227
No, I mean, you're all
playing your own roles.

19:49.252 --> 19:52.187
You have a healthy respect
for your colleagues.

19:52.313 --> 19:55.482
There's none of those
tedious office romances.

19:59.769 --> 20:01.770
Or did I speak too soon?

20:02.189 --> 20:04.156
I didn't say anything.

20:04.224 --> 20:05.920
So there's something to say?

20:06.732 --> 20:08.099
Nothing's happened.

20:10.474 --> 20:12.098
Ah.

20:12.208 --> 20:13.876
So, he likes you, too,

20:13.901 --> 20:15.678
but neither of you have
done anything about it.

20:15.935 --> 20:17.079
Okay.

20:17.104 --> 20:18.905
You're one to talk, all right?

20:18.972 --> 20:20.606
Look at you and Magnum. All your...

20:20.717 --> 20:25.022
all your playful banter and adorable
bickering. I- I see what's up.

20:25.047 --> 20:28.685
Oh, please. Thomas and I have a
strictly professional relationship.

20:33.646 --> 20:34.679
But...

20:34.825 --> 20:36.521
a while ago...

20:37.342 --> 20:41.203
I did get heavily involved
with someone I worked with

20:41.228 --> 20:42.810
at MI6.

20:43.116 --> 20:44.286
Really?

20:44.641 --> 20:46.041
What happened?

20:48.135 --> 20:49.535
It was great.

20:49.560 --> 20:50.857
For a while.

20:52.105 --> 20:53.571
Until it wasn't.

21:02.058 --> 21:05.477
- Please tell me you found Waldo.
- Yeah. See for yourself.

21:05.502 --> 21:07.163
Unauthorized vehicle
at the service entrance

21:07.187 --> 21:08.454
at the time of the meet.

21:08.565 --> 21:11.500
The driver stays with the
ride. Passenger heads inside.

21:11.525 --> 21:13.369
We had to blow it
up, so the security footage

21:13.393 --> 21:15.561
- is very degraded.
- But that could be the chap

21:15.586 --> 21:17.257
that our client's
husband was meeting with.

21:17.282 --> 21:19.074
Yeah, I'm thinking the driver
was the one who alerted them

21:19.099 --> 21:20.499
when we showed up.

21:20.567 --> 21:22.602
Oh, nicely done, Eagle Eye.

21:22.627 --> 21:24.839
The faces are too
pixilated to make out much detail.

21:25.155 --> 21:27.289
I'll see what I can do to enhance them.

21:35.141 --> 21:37.110
Hey, yo, fellas, thanks for the ride.

21:37.135 --> 21:40.234
I would've called my people,
but Magnum insisted on calling you guys.

21:40.259 --> 21:41.526
Sounds about right.

21:41.551 --> 21:42.618
We're used to it.

21:42.643 --> 21:43.687
Hey, just so I know,

21:43.712 --> 21:45.118
what kind of SEAL are you, exactly?

21:45.143 --> 21:46.674
- Is that a question?
- Well,

21:46.699 --> 21:49.134
you were happy to let that guy shoot me.

21:49.159 --> 21:51.054
So much for "no man left behind."

21:51.079 --> 21:52.713
I wasn't gonna let him shoot you.

21:52.738 --> 21:55.250
I was just making sure he understood
that you weren't worth anything to me,

21:55.274 --> 21:57.008
so he couldn't use you as leverage.

21:57.033 --> 21:58.094
Ah.

21:58.132 --> 22:01.291
- Nice save. Again. - Thanks.

22:03.045 --> 22:06.147
I'm sorry, I got to ask.

22:06.500 --> 22:08.153
There's this SEAL named McGarrett

22:08.178 --> 22:10.112
that we always used to hear about.

22:10.137 --> 22:12.533
Fought in Operation Avalanche
and the Battle of Garmsir.

22:12.558 --> 22:14.493
He also led the team

22:14.518 --> 22:16.453
that rescued those hostages in Karachi.

22:16.478 --> 22:18.179
Yeah. Yeah, that was me.

22:18.204 --> 22:20.696
Man, you realize

22:20.721 --> 22:23.211
this is the same cat that took out Anton

22:23.236 --> 22:25.704
- and Victor Hess?
- Yeah. So?

22:25.729 --> 22:26.729
So?

22:26.754 --> 22:28.388
This dude is a legit legend.

22:28.508 --> 22:30.024
You know, and I'm glad
you brought it up, because

22:30.049 --> 22:31.766
I was gonna do it if you didn't do it.

22:31.791 --> 22:34.766
I-I just want to say,
sir, it's an honor.

22:34.791 --> 22:35.858
Thank you, bud.

22:36.797 --> 22:38.717
I don't know why you guys are making

22:38.742 --> 22:40.009
such a big deal... I mean,

22:40.034 --> 22:41.563
- we all served here, right?
- Well, look,

22:41.588 --> 22:44.141
we've all swung a bat, too,
but we're not all Ty Cobb.

22:44.166 --> 22:46.399
- Or Jackie Robinson.
- Jackie Robinson!

22:46.424 --> 22:47.461
This guy's Jackie Robinson!

22:47.486 --> 22:49.522
Okay, I know, I know what you're doing.

22:49.547 --> 22:51.008
- I know what you're doing.
- Hanging out with Jackie Robinson.

22:51.033 --> 22:52.397
Fellas, fellas,

22:52.422 --> 22:54.389
we are in the presence of greatness.

22:54.500 --> 22:55.634
TC, you have

22:55.659 --> 22:57.494
literally never driven so slow.

22:57.534 --> 23:00.252
My bad, brother. My bad.

23:05.545 --> 23:06.678
Hey.

23:07.204 --> 23:09.118
So, you got to drive a Ferrari?

23:09.158 --> 23:11.217
- How was it?
- Dude, we just got held up at gunpoint,

23:11.250 --> 23:12.528
and that's your first question to me?

23:12.553 --> 23:14.321
Like you ain't never had
a gun in your face before?

23:14.346 --> 23:15.735
- It was amazing.
- Tell me about it later.

23:15.760 --> 23:16.821
- I will.
- All right.

23:16.846 --> 23:19.949
Hold on. That's him... That's the guy
who just cost Robin Masters

23:19.974 --> 23:22.397
- $1,600 in new tires.
- Okay, you realize

23:22.422 --> 23:24.353
you are still responsible
for that expense, Magnum?

23:24.421 --> 23:26.109
I-I didn't shoot the tires out.

23:26.134 --> 23:27.601
- That is hardly the point.
- Come on.

23:27.626 --> 23:29.045
- I'm the victim here.
- Tell it to the tire shop.

23:29.070 --> 23:30.638
These two remind you of anyone you know?

23:30.705 --> 23:32.505
- Oh, yeah.
- Danny and I are not like that.

23:32.540 --> 23:33.993
You sure?

23:34.018 --> 23:36.343
- Yeah.
- I beg to differ.

23:36.411 --> 23:38.790
So what are we gonna do about this guy?

23:38.815 --> 23:40.838
Seems this clown really gets around.

23:40.863 --> 23:42.959
He was also at the hotel this morning.

23:42.984 --> 23:45.786
He's the one that dropped off
the guy that Hong was meeting.

23:45.897 --> 23:47.397
We ran facial rec,

23:47.422 --> 23:49.223
- but no hits.
- Okay, so, this morning,

23:49.248 --> 23:51.058
these two gentlemen, both associates

23:51.083 --> 23:52.669
of the arms dealer, Daiyu Mei,

23:52.694 --> 23:54.295
go to meet Hong at the hotel.

23:54.362 --> 23:56.910
Before he gets killed,
Hong hands over an envelope

23:56.935 --> 23:59.489
to the guy on the right, and then later
on, the guy on the left goes

23:59.514 --> 24:01.466
to Hong's house, where
he bumps into you guys.

24:01.491 --> 24:02.857
- Right.
- And steals

24:02.882 --> 24:05.114
the cache of secret documents
we had just discovered.

24:05.139 --> 24:09.052
Now, I say "we," but it was
actually me who found them.

24:09.325 --> 24:11.193
Credit were credit's due. He found it.

24:11.226 --> 24:13.224
He did find it. The other thing
is that all those documents

24:13.249 --> 24:14.683
were in Chinese.

24:14.708 --> 24:17.255
Now, I only had time to,
uh, scan a couple of them,

24:17.280 --> 24:19.443
- but they certainly painted a picture.
- Really? What of?

24:19.757 --> 24:24.122
Diplomatic communiqués, uh,
classified memos, military documents.

24:24.147 --> 24:26.314
- Covert intelligence.
- Throw in his secret trips

24:26.339 --> 24:29.089
to China, and that only leads
to one logical conclusion.

24:29.114 --> 24:30.782
Daniel Hong was a spy.

24:30.807 --> 24:32.256
Most likely, uh,

24:32.289 --> 24:34.623
- Chinese MSS, I think it is.
- Great,

24:34.648 --> 24:36.833
another Chinese spy
case. Hey, do us a favor.

24:36.858 --> 24:39.036
Try not to volunteer to
get yourself captured again.

24:39.061 --> 24:39.794
Okay.

24:39.819 --> 24:41.353
- What is that about?
- We got mixed up

24:41.378 --> 24:44.107
in some spy thing last
year, and some nut-bag tried

24:44.132 --> 24:46.366
to erase his memory by throwing him

24:46.391 --> 24:47.748
into a sensory deprivation tank.

24:47.773 --> 24:49.340
For the record, he looked fierce

24:49.365 --> 24:50.513
in a Britney Spears jumpsuit.

24:50.538 --> 24:52.181
- You did.
- Hmm.

24:52.206 --> 24:54.443
- They are kidding, right?
- No.

24:54.468 --> 24:56.369
I am so sorry I missed that one.

24:56.445 --> 24:59.070
Okay, anyway, back
to the case at hand.

24:59.095 --> 25:02.056
Uh, it's gonna be very difficult
to confirm any of this, because...

25:02.081 --> 25:05.271
the CIA and MSS, they don't
openly exchange information

25:05.296 --> 25:07.255
with one another. So
getting a straight answer,

25:07.280 --> 25:09.091
or any answer, is gonna
be next to impossible.

25:09.116 --> 25:10.700
Well, I mean, maybe not.

25:10.725 --> 25:12.927
- One sec.
- Okay, here we go.

25:13.941 --> 25:15.142
Hey.

25:18.570 --> 25:19.570
Chinese.

25:19.595 --> 25:21.950
Sounds like she has
a contact in counterintelligence.

25:24.514 --> 25:25.812
She's asking for Hong's file.

25:25.837 --> 25:27.443
Am I the only one here
that doesn't speak Chinese?

25:27.468 --> 25:28.702
Shh...

25:28.890 --> 25:29.927
Great.

25:31.249 --> 25:32.616
Nice.

25:42.762 --> 25:44.809
Well, um, had I known we'd be doing

25:44.834 --> 25:46.191
such sneaky spy stuff today,

25:46.216 --> 25:47.983
I would have brought my trench coat.

25:48.770 --> 25:50.502
I think you've taken cloak-and-dagger

25:50.527 --> 25:53.082
- a bit literally.
- Oh, come on. I'm digging this.

25:53.107 --> 25:56.863
You had the most
bad-ass job in the world.

25:57.379 --> 26:00.045
What was that like? Spill the tea.

26:00.070 --> 26:01.804
"Spill the tea"? Is
that 'cause I'm British?

26:01.829 --> 26:03.997
Uh, no, it means "give
me the good stuff."

26:04.193 --> 26:06.449
You know, give me the gossip, the Intel.

26:06.474 --> 26:07.574
- Oh.
- The juicy details.

26:07.599 --> 26:09.715
- Give me the tea.
- Oh. Right.

26:09.740 --> 26:12.600
I actually quite like that. Um...

26:12.992 --> 26:17.319
I mean... honestly,
spy-craft isn't all that glamorous.

26:17.430 --> 26:19.030
It's just a lot of...

26:19.055 --> 26:21.623
waiting around, having
to be endlessly patient.

26:22.051 --> 26:24.590
Most of the time you're alone.

26:25.246 --> 26:28.507
Yeah. Well, I guess that
makes it hard to date, too.

26:28.532 --> 26:30.254
You know, hard to find someone who...

26:30.357 --> 26:31.724
gets the life.

26:32.045 --> 26:34.613
That's probably why you fell
for someone so close to home.

26:37.790 --> 26:39.290
Perhaps so.

26:42.470 --> 26:44.251
I'll do the talking.

26:54.734 --> 26:57.269
I had to call in a
number of favors for this.

26:57.571 --> 27:00.238
So, now we're even? Yes?

27:00.306 --> 27:01.640
Well...

27:01.665 --> 27:04.367
I'm not sure that this
entirely wipes your slate clean.

27:04.392 --> 27:06.287
I mean, it was a terribly
embarrassing predicament

27:06.312 --> 27:08.713
I extricated you from in Kuala Lumpur.

27:09.251 --> 27:12.017
So I'd say you still have
a ways to go, wouldn't you?

27:12.042 --> 27:15.779
- That's a story I'd like to hear.
- Oh. So would Zhou's wife.

27:15.804 --> 27:19.243
But... his secret is safe with me.

27:19.268 --> 27:20.468
For now.

27:25.430 --> 27:26.598
So you know,

27:26.709 --> 27:28.555
Beijing is none too pleased

27:28.580 --> 27:30.548
that their agent has
been taken out of play.

27:30.573 --> 27:32.516
Seems that Daniel Hong was
about as high-level an asset

27:32.541 --> 27:34.442
as you can get.

27:44.960 --> 27:46.969
- Tani, what do you got?
- Great news.

27:46.994 --> 27:48.461
Juliet's contact came through.

27:48.486 --> 27:50.398
We got Daniel Hong's MSS file.

27:50.423 --> 27:54.159
It appears his focus was on penetrating
U.S. intelligence and defense sectors.

27:54.184 --> 27:58.406
In the past several years, he's
infiltrated a number of private

27:58.431 --> 28:00.665
military contractors,
funneling information

28:00.690 --> 28:02.157
and trade secrets back to Beijing.

28:02.182 --> 28:04.132
Basically, he's an alpha dog Chinese spy

28:04.157 --> 28:06.347
- with a focus on the defense industry.
- So we have to assume

28:06.372 --> 28:08.016
that there was related
Intel in that envelope

28:08.040 --> 28:09.140
he handed off at the hotel.

28:09.208 --> 28:11.461
Yo. So, the guy who held up

28:11.486 --> 28:13.487
McGarrett and Magnum,
the car he was driving

28:13.512 --> 28:15.569
was found parked
outside a house in Manoa.

28:15.594 --> 28:17.358
Okay, did you guys get that?

28:17.383 --> 28:18.817
Yeah, great. Go get him.

28:18.884 --> 28:21.519
Uh, before you arrest him, or worse,

28:21.544 --> 28:24.279
would you please remember
that he owes Magnum $1,600?

28:24.452 --> 28:26.286
Yes, ma'am.

28:29.995 --> 28:31.229
Five-O!

28:31.297 --> 28:32.163
Don't do it!

28:37.129 --> 28:38.863
Mind if we have a word?

28:39.114 --> 28:41.182
Yikes. Gut shot.

28:41.495 --> 28:42.750
Good news is,

28:42.775 --> 28:44.209
assuming the bullet missed vitals,

28:44.234 --> 28:46.754
you got a solid 30 minutes to
an hour before you bleed out.

28:46.779 --> 28:47.846
So...

28:47.871 --> 28:49.539
you need medical attention.

28:49.602 --> 28:51.302
We need information.

28:51.327 --> 28:52.627
What's it gonna be?

29:12.883 --> 29:14.217
Tani, hey.

29:14.242 --> 29:15.242
Adam.

29:15.454 --> 29:17.155
Where have you been?

29:17.269 --> 29:18.636
Listen, uh...

29:19.025 --> 29:21.150
I'm sorry I haven't returned
any of your calls, but...

29:21.818 --> 29:24.267
there's no need to worry, all right?
Everything's okay.

29:24.292 --> 29:26.327
Is it? Because I'm...
I'm really struggling

29:26.352 --> 29:27.619
to make sense of this here.

29:27.697 --> 29:29.898
You quit the team out of nowhere.

29:29.923 --> 29:31.891
You stopped talking to everyone.

29:31.916 --> 29:35.179
I... I'm sorry, I need, I
need to know what's going on.

29:35.204 --> 29:37.973
Tani, I just have some personal
stuff I'm working through,

29:37.998 --> 29:40.299
and I need some time
away to sort it all out.

29:40.720 --> 29:43.181
Look, I know you're concerned, okay?

29:43.206 --> 29:47.243
And I appreciate that, but...
all I can say is, don't be.

29:48.958 --> 29:51.259
You have a family here, Adam.

29:51.421 --> 29:53.956
You-you have a family
that you can count on.

29:54.536 --> 29:56.501
After everything that
we've been through together,

29:56.526 --> 29:58.860
after everything you and I
have been through together,

29:58.885 --> 30:00.067
I just...

30:00.524 --> 30:02.558
I-I hope you know that.

30:03.633 --> 30:05.161
I do, Tani.

30:05.601 --> 30:07.278
Really, I do.

30:13.370 --> 30:15.286
Listen, I'm sorry, we're just...

30:15.311 --> 30:17.412
we're in the middle of
something right now. Um...

30:17.523 --> 30:19.924
but can... can you and
I meet up for coffee

30:19.949 --> 30:21.440
and maybe talk about this?

30:23.445 --> 30:25.446
Uh, yeah, sure.

30:26.639 --> 30:27.739
Let's do that.

30:27.966 --> 30:29.033
Okay.

30:29.058 --> 30:30.559
All right, I'll be in touch.

30:30.626 --> 30:32.127
Thanks, Tani.

30:43.236 --> 30:45.236
_

30:56.462 --> 30:59.330
So here's what our
gut-shot thug just told us.

30:59.355 --> 31:01.352
For starters, his name is Justin Lee.

31:01.400 --> 31:03.815
He also gave up
his accomplice, a Brandon Powell.

31:03.902 --> 31:05.436
But unfortunately,

31:05.461 --> 31:07.172
the name "Brandon Powell"
appears to be an alias,

31:07.196 --> 31:08.230
so we still don't have

31:08.255 --> 31:09.533
- a jacket on him.
- I'll run the alias.

31:09.558 --> 31:10.725
Let's see if anything pops.

31:10.750 --> 31:12.061
All right, so here's the story.

31:12.086 --> 31:14.724
Apparently, Hong reached out
with a business proposition,

31:14.749 --> 31:16.550
but he wasn't trying to move weapons.

31:16.575 --> 31:18.043
It was information.

31:18.068 --> 31:20.494
Somehow, Hong got his
hands on a NOC list.

31:20.519 --> 31:22.153
It's a list of intelligence assets

31:22.178 --> 31:23.779
that Beijing thinks are on their side,

31:23.804 --> 31:26.006
but who are actually
working on behalf of the CIA.

31:26.031 --> 31:27.398
If those names are made public,

31:27.423 --> 31:29.268
it would be a huge blow for
American counterintelligence,

31:29.293 --> 31:30.804
and a huge win for Beijing.

31:30.829 --> 31:32.970
That would also
make Hong a hero back home.

31:32.995 --> 31:34.800
But that's not what
he was after, was it?

31:34.825 --> 31:37.010
- Nah, I think he was after a payday.
- Right.

31:37.035 --> 31:39.620
Only he couldn't cash in
without being branded a traitor.

31:39.645 --> 31:41.736
So he makes a deal
with these guys instead.

31:41.761 --> 31:43.161
Exactly, and according to Lee,

31:43.186 --> 31:44.697
once Mei got the list, she was planning

31:44.722 --> 31:46.213
on selling it to the Chinese herself.

31:46.238 --> 31:47.720
Once she got the list?

31:47.745 --> 31:49.271
Wasn't that what was in

31:49.296 --> 31:51.398
the envelope that Hong
handed to Powell at the hotel?

31:51.423 --> 31:53.257
That's exactly what was in the envelope.

31:53.282 --> 31:56.278
But the NOC list is on an SD
card that's heavily encrypted.

31:56.334 --> 31:58.435
The deal was, Mei would get

31:58.481 --> 32:00.658
the password once the $50
million she agreed to pay

32:00.690 --> 32:02.125
was wired into Hong's account.

32:02.228 --> 32:03.828
Only, that all went out the window

32:03.853 --> 32:05.353
once Hong was killed at the hotel.

32:06.565 --> 32:08.299
That must have been why Mei sent her man

32:08.324 --> 32:09.468
to Hong's house. She was hoping

32:09.492 --> 32:11.093
there was another copy of that list.

32:11.160 --> 32:12.542
Yeah, and thankfully,
they came up empty,

32:12.567 --> 32:13.964
because there wasn't another copy.

32:13.989 --> 32:16.290
So now Mei has instructed
Powell to do whatever it takes

32:16.315 --> 32:18.362
to crack the encryption on the SD card.

32:18.387 --> 32:19.487
If he's successful,

32:19.512 --> 32:21.122
a significant number of agents working

32:21.147 --> 32:23.381
for the U.S. government
will be in immediate danger.

32:24.825 --> 32:27.394
Okay, we got a hit. Brandon Powell.

32:27.419 --> 32:29.315
Name comes up on a rental agreement

32:29.340 --> 32:31.565
on a property in Waimanalo.

32:52.683 --> 32:54.450
Fall into position.

32:54.475 --> 32:56.075
On my mark.

33:00.447 --> 33:02.214
Who invited the Feds?

33:05.151 --> 33:06.348
Captain Grover.

33:06.373 --> 33:09.500
- Officer Hollis, Central Intelligence.
- What's going on here?

33:09.525 --> 33:12.585
What's going on is we've been
tracking Powell for weeks now.

33:12.610 --> 33:14.098
- He's ours.
- And you just

33:14.123 --> 33:16.525
so happened to get a location
on him the minute we arrived?

33:16.917 --> 33:19.403
Or have you been monitoring HPD's comms

33:19.428 --> 33:21.196
and just piggybacking on our Intel?

33:21.306 --> 33:25.576
Look, Officer Hollis, we
both want the same thing.

33:25.601 --> 33:27.102
Take the lead, we'll back you up.

33:27.271 --> 33:30.573
Well, I appreciate that, but we
can manage just fine on our own.

33:32.461 --> 33:34.162
All right, let's move.

33:36.108 --> 33:38.346
Okay, SWAT team, fall
back. We're standing down.

33:43.786 --> 33:45.488
What is that about?

33:45.513 --> 33:47.455
CIA just pulled jurisdiction.

33:47.566 --> 33:49.133
In my experience,

33:49.158 --> 33:52.460
Feds like to swoop in just as
you're about to make a collar.

34:27.757 --> 34:29.873
Hey, Lou, we just heard what happened.

34:29.899 --> 34:31.833
Is everybody okay? You guys okay?

34:32.018 --> 34:34.842
Yeah, we're good, but I got to tell you.

34:34.868 --> 34:36.734
If the CIA didn't step
in and make us stand down,

34:36.759 --> 34:38.873
we'd be the ones getting
barbecued in that house.

34:39.132 --> 34:40.101
Yeah, Daiyu Mei

34:40.126 --> 34:42.820
must have directed Lee to send
us here if he was captured.

34:42.844 --> 34:45.480
She was expecting us
to die in that blast.

34:45.699 --> 34:47.554
Okay. How many they lose?

34:47.579 --> 34:49.148
They lost six.

34:50.859 --> 34:52.695
Bomb must have been on a time delay.

34:52.719 --> 34:55.522
Moment those agents breached,
it started counting down.

34:55.547 --> 34:58.374
Smart. Maximizes casualties.

34:58.551 --> 35:00.538
Guys, got an update.
CSU is still processing,

35:00.563 --> 35:03.187
but apparently, there were
seven bodies in the house.

35:03.804 --> 35:05.171
Wait. Hang on. Didn't you just say

35:05.196 --> 35:07.585
that six agents went into
the house. Who else was there?

35:07.672 --> 35:09.890
CSU managed to pull a print
off the seventh body.

35:09.915 --> 35:11.882
Came back to a guy named "Bruce Iona."

35:11.907 --> 35:13.040
- Run him.
- They also

35:13.065 --> 35:14.209
determined that Iona's hands were bound,

35:14.234 --> 35:15.975
and he had a GSW to the head.

35:16.000 --> 35:18.655
So Powell goes out this
afternoon, leaving behind a dead guy

35:18.680 --> 35:20.147
with a bullet in his head.

35:20.333 --> 35:21.867
Not at all troubling.

35:22.068 --> 35:23.268
All right, check this out.

35:23.293 --> 35:26.053
Bruce Iona... he works
as a guard at Halawa prison.

35:26.378 --> 35:29.097
- Okay, now I'm really confused.
- You and me both.

35:29.122 --> 35:30.202
Why are these guys suddenly

35:30.227 --> 35:32.091
interested in a prison guard?

35:32.116 --> 35:35.788
What do we know? We know that
Daiyu Mei wants that NOC list, right?

35:35.813 --> 35:36.957
But to get that, she's got to

35:36.982 --> 35:38.702
break the encryption on the SD card.

35:38.727 --> 35:42.126
So she has her man grab a prison guard.

35:42.151 --> 35:43.985
- Why?
- I'll tell you why.

35:44.010 --> 35:47.084
Who do we know at Halawa
who can hack next-gen encryption?

35:47.109 --> 35:49.533
That'd be Aaron Wright.

35:49.558 --> 35:52.627
Okay, I'm judging by your faces that
this chap is rather good with computers?

35:52.779 --> 35:55.452
Oh. He's only the
best hacker on the island.

35:56.907 --> 36:00.177
He's also a pain in the ass.
I will meet you guys there.

36:01.829 --> 36:03.764
_

36:03.789 --> 36:06.592
I want all prisoners in their cells
and this entire place on lock-down.

36:06.617 --> 36:09.719
All staff and personnel...
Nobody gets in or out.

36:09.744 --> 36:11.396
- You got it.
- Also, I need you to

36:11.421 --> 36:12.719
find inmate Aaron Wright

36:12.744 --> 36:15.512
and make sure he's in the
most secure location you have.

36:19.939 --> 36:21.807
Excuse me.

36:23.481 --> 36:26.584
That's him! That's the guy we
saw meeting Hong at the hotel!

36:26.609 --> 36:28.744
Open that door! Open it!

36:35.260 --> 36:36.727
Hey! Hey!

36:38.516 --> 36:41.909
Everybody stay down! Stay down!

36:56.671 --> 36:58.444
I got the NOC list.

37:24.459 --> 37:26.639
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey.

37:26.664 --> 37:29.466
Well, think we've gotten in
your way enough for one day.

37:29.491 --> 37:32.459
I was just about to, uh, return
this list of names to the CIA,

37:32.484 --> 37:34.262
and make sure they don't
fall in the wrong hands again.

37:34.295 --> 37:38.383
Well, thanks to you, a whole bunch
of double agents can continue doing...

37:38.408 --> 37:39.875
whatever double agents do.

37:39.978 --> 37:41.345
Let me tell you something, Thomas.

37:41.370 --> 37:43.672
If this, uh, this list
of names had gotten out,

37:43.697 --> 37:44.897
it would have been a huge blow

37:44.922 --> 37:46.401
to American counterintelligence efforts.

37:46.426 --> 37:49.562
And we were able to prevent
that because of your help.

37:49.587 --> 37:50.687
So thank you.

37:50.824 --> 37:53.192
- I'm glad we can help.
- Thanks, man.

37:57.373 --> 37:59.138
Joe White?

37:59.163 --> 38:00.297
Joe White.

38:00.322 --> 38:01.422
I never had the privilege

38:01.447 --> 38:04.366
of having him as an instructor,
but I heard all the stories, man.

38:04.391 --> 38:06.397
The guy is, like, a legend.

38:06.422 --> 38:08.289
Yeah. He was.

38:10.108 --> 38:11.684
Were you guys close?

38:12.311 --> 38:14.654
Yeah, we were. We were close.

38:14.905 --> 38:16.592
Yeah, I'm sorry.

38:16.917 --> 38:18.384
Appreciate it, man. Thanks.

38:19.123 --> 38:21.661
And, you know, um...

38:22.303 --> 38:25.098
If you ever want to grab a beer
or something, give me a call.

38:25.123 --> 38:28.389
- Us team guys got to stick together.
- Thanks, man. I will.

38:28.414 --> 38:30.703
Maybe you can bring those boys
along. They're good for the ego.

38:30.728 --> 38:33.381
Yeah, as long as you bring your partner.

38:33.557 --> 38:36.482
Oh, and you can be
the designated driver.

38:36.507 --> 38:37.740
I appreciate that.

38:37.765 --> 38:39.232
Thank you.

38:39.257 --> 38:41.553
Oh, hey, uh, White Knight?

38:43.233 --> 38:46.270
Your secret's safe with me.

38:51.777 --> 38:55.309
Well, Ms. Rey, it's been an
absolute treat, as they say.

38:55.848 --> 38:58.661
Well, likewise... as they say.

38:59.123 --> 39:00.672
I have to be honest.

39:00.697 --> 39:03.703
Uh, we're usually a much
more dysfunctional bunch.

39:03.728 --> 39:05.539
I think you caught us on a good day.

39:05.564 --> 39:07.617
Somehow, I highly doubt that.

39:09.313 --> 39:12.536
I-I was thinking about
what you said earlier,

39:12.561 --> 39:14.228
and you're right.

39:14.253 --> 39:17.588
The jobs we've chosen
aren't ordinary, and,

39:17.613 --> 39:20.992
as such, maybe the
ordinary rules don't apply.

39:22.527 --> 39:25.539
If you find someone at work

39:25.968 --> 39:27.894
who brings a little
light into your life,

39:28.648 --> 39:30.437
someone who makes you happy,

39:30.925 --> 39:32.159
you should pursue it.

39:33.981 --> 39:37.083
Truth is, even knowing
how badly it ended

39:37.108 --> 39:39.042
for me,

39:39.318 --> 39:41.585
I would still do it all over again.

39:41.863 --> 39:44.997
Bye.

40:00.061 --> 40:01.195
Hey, T, what's up?

40:01.220 --> 40:02.553
Hi. I'm good.

40:02.578 --> 40:04.412
I mean, not much. You?

40:04.726 --> 40:09.263
Um... I just was calling
to see what you were up to.

40:09.288 --> 40:11.822
Not much. Everything good?

40:11.847 --> 40:14.182
Yes. Yeah. No, everything's
good. Everything's good.

40:14.207 --> 40:17.390
Um... it's just, uh...

40:18.157 --> 40:20.158
So, there's this new place.

40:20.183 --> 40:22.615
Um, it's on the water on Sand Island.

40:22.640 --> 40:24.141
And... it's a bar.

40:24.166 --> 40:26.000
Uh, La Mariana. Yeah, I know it.

40:26.093 --> 40:30.263
Yes. Um, well, I hear it's
under new management, and, um...

40:30.288 --> 40:33.657
I-I was wondering if you wanted

40:33.682 --> 40:35.983
to get a drink there... with me.

40:36.734 --> 40:38.477
Tonight.

40:38.509 --> 40:41.211
Say... 9:00?

40:42.352 --> 40:46.412
- Yeah, I would love that.
- Okay. Great.

40:46.745 --> 40:48.779
Okay, see you there.

40:49.625 --> 40:52.762
- Bye-bye.
- All right, bye.
