02:21.961 --> 02:23.929
My father was an inventor.

02:24.764 --> 02:28.666
A genius with anything mechanical.
Nine patents, six pending.

02:30.469 --> 02:34.064
He dropped out of Harvard
"to get an education," he said.

02:34.940 --> 02:36.771
I grew up with the belief...

02:36.842 --> 02:40.243
...that the world belonged to him
and that everything he said was true.

02:40.312 --> 02:43.213
Look around you.
How did America get this way?

02:43.482 --> 02:45.780
Land of promise. Land of opportunity.

02:46.719 --> 02:49.916
"Give us the wretched refuse
of your teaming shore."

02:50.423 --> 02:52.448
Have a Coke! Watch TV.

02:52.825 --> 02:53.985
Have a nice day.

02:54.060 --> 02:55.288
Go on welfare.

02:56.495 --> 02:58.190
Get free money.

02:58.497 --> 03:00.988
Turn to crime. Crime pays in this country.

03:05.237 --> 03:08.695
Why do they put up with it?
Why do they keep coming?

03:09.375 --> 03:11.400
Look around you, Charlie.

03:12.178 --> 03:13.509
This place is a toilet.

03:19.185 --> 03:22.643
The whole damn country is turning
into a dope-taking, door-locking...

03:22.722 --> 03:25.850
...ulcerated danger zone
of rabid scavengers...

03:25.925 --> 03:28.155
...criminal millionaires and moral sneaks.

03:28.227 --> 03:30.957
Nobody ever thinks
of leaving this country. I do.

03:31.030 --> 03:32.861
I think about it every day.

03:33.733 --> 03:35.132
I'm the last man.

03:36.602 --> 03:40.265
I want an 8-foot length of rubber seal
with foam backing.

03:42.842 --> 03:44.969
This country's going to the dogs.

03:46.278 --> 03:47.677
Nobody cares.

03:49.448 --> 03:52.349
"I just work here." That's the attitude.

03:52.885 --> 03:55.251
Buy junk, sell junk, eat junk.

03:56.055 --> 03:57.716
$3.99.

03:57.857 --> 04:00.382
- Don't want it.
- That's what you asked for.

04:00.693 --> 04:02.957
Who are you working for? The Japanese?

04:03.362 --> 04:06.525
- If you don't want it, just say so.
- Just said so. Don't want it.

04:06.599 --> 04:09.124
Look. Made in Japan.
I don't want my hard-earned...

04:09.201 --> 04:13.604
...American dollars converted into yen.
I want an American length of rubber seal.

04:13.939 --> 04:15.566
Do you work here?

04:16.242 --> 04:19.973
All right, we'll get it someplace else.
This is not the only place in town.

04:20.045 --> 04:21.204
Good-bye.

04:23.449 --> 04:26.179
Or maybe I should have said, "Sayonara!"

04:30.022 --> 04:33.753
I tell you, Charlie, I'm not goin' back
into Hatfield again.

04:34.460 --> 04:38.294
I'm sick of dealing with people
who want things I've already rejected.

04:38.364 --> 04:40.332
Things they see on TV.

04:40.766 --> 04:44.600
They talk about nuclear destruction
as if it were a game show topic.

04:50.309 --> 04:54.302
All winter, Father had been saying,
"There's going to be a war in America.

04:54.480 --> 04:58.109
"It's coming," he said.
He was restless and talkative.

04:58.350 --> 05:01.911
He said the signs were everywhere.
In the high prices, the bad tempers...

05:01.987 --> 05:05.252
...the gut worry, and the stupidity
and greed of people.

05:05.324 --> 05:07.656
Bloody crimes were being committed
in the cities...

05:07.726 --> 05:09.660
...and the criminals were unpunished.

05:09.728 --> 05:12.356
It wasn't going to be
an ordinary war, he said...

05:12.631 --> 05:16.089
...but rather a war in which no side
was entirely innocent.

05:21.841 --> 05:23.968
It's like a human's insides.

05:25.477 --> 05:27.104
Entrails and vitals.

05:28.214 --> 05:30.409
See, that's his digestive system.

05:31.383 --> 05:32.850
Circulatory system.

05:33.886 --> 05:35.376
Respiration. Lungs.

05:36.488 --> 05:38.513
Fatty tissue. Kidneys.

05:39.358 --> 05:40.518
The ammonia?

05:41.594 --> 05:43.255
That's his plasma.

05:44.864 --> 05:45.922
Got it?

05:47.032 --> 05:48.124
But, Dad...

05:49.401 --> 05:50.629
...what is it?

05:51.036 --> 05:53.504
It's perfection. That's what it is.

06:03.582 --> 06:05.140
Where is he, Mrs. Fox?

06:06.285 --> 06:07.445
Mrs. Fox!

06:12.324 --> 06:14.588
He's not here right now, Mr. Polski.

06:15.728 --> 06:19.323
He had to go to Hatfield
to get a part for something.

06:20.366 --> 06:22.300
I can see his truck, Mrs. Fox.

06:22.368 --> 06:24.529
He's there fooling about in his workshop...

06:24.603 --> 06:27.538
...when he should be rigging up
a cooling system in the barn!

06:27.673 --> 06:29.937
I have asparagus rotting all over the place.

06:30.009 --> 06:32.170
Now, you tell him to get down here
and now!

06:34.680 --> 06:37.205
He was pretty mad.
Something about a cooling system.

06:37.283 --> 06:40.650
Forget that. I got something much better
for him out there.

06:40.719 --> 06:43.813
Honey, he's gonna love it.
I'm gonna knock his socks off.

06:43.889 --> 06:45.823
I'm gonna straighten his hair.

07:02.641 --> 07:03.903
Where you been?

07:06.779 --> 07:08.804
About half a glass of water.

07:10.616 --> 07:11.844
What is this?

07:12.318 --> 07:13.615
Got a match, Doc?

07:13.752 --> 07:17.688
You get here late, the asparagus is rotting,
and you ask me for a match?

07:18.424 --> 07:20.585
If it wouldn't be too much trouble.

07:24.997 --> 07:25.986
Mr. Fox.

07:28.067 --> 07:30.228
Jerry, what's he doing?
He won't answer me.

07:30.302 --> 07:31.701
I don't know.

07:37.710 --> 07:39.302
Now he cooks a glass of water.

07:39.378 --> 07:41.846
What is this thing? It looks like a stove.

07:42.147 --> 07:43.171
My baby.

07:44.950 --> 07:46.315
It's my baby boy.

07:51.490 --> 07:54.516
Fat Boy. That's what we'll call it. Fat Boy.

07:54.827 --> 07:57.091
- This is foolishness!
- Patience, Doc.

07:57.496 --> 07:59.691
Please, I've got work to do.

08:09.742 --> 08:11.869
Come on, Doc! Take a look.

08:21.487 --> 08:23.079
Boy, ain't that something?

08:23.155 --> 08:25.555
But how did I do it? Where's the juice?

08:26.091 --> 08:27.922
Where's the electrical cord?

08:28.560 --> 08:29.458
Kerosene.

08:29.528 --> 08:31.155
I made ice out of fire.

08:32.898 --> 08:34.024
Yes. So it seems.

08:34.099 --> 08:35.657
Wanna see how it works?

08:35.734 --> 08:37.827
No, no! Some other time. Here.

08:38.470 --> 08:40.597
This is just a scale model.

08:40.938 --> 08:44.466
I'm planning on building you
a huge one, Doc. What do you think?

08:45.310 --> 08:46.504
What I think is...

08:46.578 --> 08:49.513
...I'm in the asparagus business,
not the inventing business.

08:49.581 --> 08:51.378
You're missin' the point, Doc.

08:51.450 --> 08:54.385
I can preserve the excess
with Fat Boy here.

08:54.453 --> 08:58.048
- With that thing? It's too small.
- I told you, this is a scale model!

08:58.123 --> 09:01.058
And it's ingenious, Mr. Fox.
That's why I hired you.

09:01.193 --> 09:04.185
But I also hired you to do
what I ask you to do.

09:04.430 --> 09:07.558
To come up with a simple,
practical cooling system in the barn...

09:07.633 --> 09:11.125
...and not fool around with crazy schemes
and go off in my time...

09:11.203 --> 09:13.137
...inventing contraptions!

09:14.540 --> 09:16.303
Now, please, to work!

09:16.875 --> 09:19.639
What's this? It's not a rest period!
We have work to do.

09:19.711 --> 09:21.872
Close that door. We'll lose all the cold.

09:22.414 --> 09:24.882
He didn't like it very much, Dad.

09:26.151 --> 09:28.312
He hated it. Positively hated it.

09:29.588 --> 09:31.180
Absolute contempt.

09:32.524 --> 09:34.219
But I'm glad of that.

09:34.293 --> 09:37.956
That's what really gets me cookin'.
What would have happened if he liked it?

09:38.030 --> 09:41.989
Then I really would've been worried.
Then I'd have gone back to bed.

09:52.344 --> 09:55.245
What do you know?
We got a couple of minutes, okay?

09:55.414 --> 09:56.881
All right. Here you go.

10:09.461 --> 10:10.985
Migrant workers.

10:12.364 --> 10:13.854
Polski's peons.

10:14.833 --> 10:18.633
Right out of the jungle.
Didn't know when they were well off.

10:20.172 --> 10:24.165
They think this is a paradise.
I'd trade places with them in a minute.

10:24.843 --> 10:27.937
You know what they got down there?
Geothermal energy.

10:28.046 --> 10:31.311
All the juice they need 5,000 feet
under the surface.

10:31.817 --> 10:34.047
It's the earth's bellybutton.

10:38.991 --> 10:43.052
Imagine the problems they have
in the jungle without refrigeration.

10:44.963 --> 10:48.160
If they saw an ice cube
they'd probably think it was a...

10:49.067 --> 10:51.865
...a diamond, or a jewel of some kind.

10:53.338 --> 10:54.327
Ice...

10:55.674 --> 10:57.141
...is civilization.

11:02.714 --> 11:04.545
I want to show you boys something.

11:33.378 --> 11:35.539
They call this place the "Monkey House."

11:35.614 --> 11:37.582
- Who calls it that?
- Kids.

11:37.883 --> 11:41.080
I'd whale the tar out of 'em.
Don't let me hear you call it that.

11:41.153 --> 11:44.418
Look at this place. These are poor people.
Look at what they own.

11:44.489 --> 11:47.925
Look at what they eat. They don't even eat
the asparagus they cut.

11:47.993 --> 11:49.984
I don't think we should be here.

11:50.062 --> 11:52.155
They welcome visitors, Son.

11:52.397 --> 11:54.160
It's a custom from the jungle.

11:54.233 --> 11:57.430
"Be kind to strangers. Never know
when you might be one yourself."

11:57.769 --> 11:59.828
That's the law of the jungle.

12:00.339 --> 12:02.330
But this isn't the jungle, Dad.

12:02.407 --> 12:06.503
No? No, because no jungle
is as murderous and foul as this is.

12:07.546 --> 12:11.004
They trade green trees for this ruin.
It's pathetic.

12:12.050 --> 12:13.642
And it makes me mad...

12:14.086 --> 12:17.419
...because they're going to end up
being part of the problem.

12:27.833 --> 12:29.960
It would take courage to go there.

12:31.870 --> 12:32.859
Go where?

12:34.373 --> 12:35.465
The jungle.

12:38.043 --> 12:39.738
Not ordinary gumption...

12:41.346 --> 12:43.507
...but 4:00 in the morning courage.

12:46.551 --> 12:47.984
And who's got that?

12:53.358 --> 12:54.347
Thanks.

13:15.080 --> 13:16.172
What is it?

13:17.082 --> 13:19.243
I think something's going to happen.

13:19.518 --> 13:20.746
Like what?

13:22.888 --> 13:24.583
Something terrible.

13:28.226 --> 13:32.185
When you're young, the world seems like
a big and a strange place.

13:32.264 --> 13:35.665
If you think about it too much,
you start to worry.

13:35.901 --> 13:38.597
But Dad's not young and he's worried.

13:40.105 --> 13:42.335
He's always like that
before a new invention.

13:42.407 --> 13:44.875
You know him. He's got a lot on his mind.

13:46.545 --> 13:48.604
But something is going to happen.

13:48.847 --> 13:50.337
Something good.

13:55.854 --> 13:57.788
- Good night.
- Sleep tight.

14:05.831 --> 14:07.594
- Hey, boys!
- Cornelius!

14:07.666 --> 14:10.499
- Come here and give me a hand!
- Good morning. What that?

14:10.569 --> 14:13.003
I got somethin' for ya.
You're gonna love this.

14:13.071 --> 14:14.800
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

14:16.475 --> 14:18.909
I need four men, two on each side.

14:18.977 --> 14:21.741
Cornelius, grab that thing
with the wheels on it.

14:24.583 --> 14:26.175
We're not allowed to go in.

14:26.251 --> 14:28.116
What's going on in there?

14:28.487 --> 14:29.647
Beats me.

14:56.615 --> 14:58.378
We're not allowed to go in!

14:59.418 --> 15:02.114
- Little Charlie's here!
- Your father great man!

15:02.421 --> 15:05.515
He my father, too. We all his children.

15:06.892 --> 15:09.918
Charlie, come here.
I want you to do something for me.

15:10.362 --> 15:12.125
Take this and give it to Polski.

15:12.197 --> 15:14.188
I'll take it, Dad. I'm dressed.

15:14.800 --> 15:17.325
Charlie's the oldest. I want him to do it.

15:18.570 --> 15:20.800
This is a historic occasion.

15:24.276 --> 15:26.335
Sit down. Sit down there.

15:29.848 --> 15:32.043
"Ever heard of the Mosquito Coast?

15:32.250 --> 15:35.378
"I hope not because that's the reason
we're going there!

15:35.454 --> 15:40.118
"See, I'm not only quitting this job
but also this sad ruin of a country.

15:41.526 --> 15:43.824
"Good luck, Doc! You'll need it."

15:50.268 --> 15:53.328
Charlie, your father is the worst kind
of pain in the neck.

15:53.405 --> 15:56.033
A know-it-all who's sometimes right.

15:57.008 --> 15:59.806
I've come to see he's a dangerous man.
You tell him that.

15:59.878 --> 16:01.607
Tell him he's a dangerous man!

16:01.680 --> 16:05.241
And one of these days,
he's going to get you all killed!

16:08.220 --> 16:09.983
Daddy, you take a picture of me.

16:10.055 --> 16:11.420
Don't waste film.

16:11.490 --> 16:13.617
- Leave those.
- It's only the breakfast things.

16:13.692 --> 16:17.355
- Leave them. We're getting out of here!
- I'll start loading things up, okay?

16:17.429 --> 16:18.760
Mother! Come on.

16:19.130 --> 16:23.362
- But what about all our books and things?
- If it's not in this pile, it's not going!

16:23.435 --> 16:25.494
- Where are we going?
- Can I ride shotgun?

16:25.570 --> 16:28.061
No. Put the bags in the back of the truck.

16:28.139 --> 16:30.937
April, come on!
Don't put everything in the cab!

16:31.743 --> 16:34.041
No, your mother's gonna ride up there.

16:35.714 --> 16:38.114
- Hurry up, Mom!
- Go to the back seat, guys.

16:38.350 --> 16:39.510
Girls, in the back.

16:39.584 --> 16:42.985
- Can I ride in the back here?
- No, no! It's not safe.

16:43.054 --> 16:45.420
"Under the bam
Under the boo

16:45.590 --> 16:47.455
"Under the bamboo tree

16:48.894 --> 16:50.293
"Two live as one

16:50.428 --> 16:52.020
"One lives as two

16:52.163 --> 16:53.721
"Two live as three

16:53.798 --> 16:55.925
"Under the bam
Under the boo

16:56.101 --> 16:57.728
"Under the bamboo tree"

17:12.017 --> 17:15.509
Good-bye, America! And have a nice day!

17:27.198 --> 17:30.497
- I'm Reverend Gurney Spellgood.
- Pleased to meet you.

17:30.569 --> 17:33.094
- You can call me Gurney.
- Call me Brighton.

17:33.171 --> 17:34.502
Jerry, sit down.

17:34.573 --> 17:38.339
Mrs. Fox, I'm Captain Smalls.
Come on over here. I have a seat for you.

17:38.843 --> 17:41.573
The sea around us. The earth beneath.

17:42.647 --> 17:46.743
This night commit this food to thy keep.

17:47.719 --> 17:48.845
Jeedoof.

17:49.154 --> 17:50.781
- Amen.
- Amen.

17:51.623 --> 17:53.853
We don't say prayers at home.

17:57.662 --> 17:59.357
Captain first, Reverend.

18:00.265 --> 18:01.698
"The last shall be first."

18:01.766 --> 18:03.529
- No, "some."
- Pardon?

18:03.668 --> 18:08.128
"Some of the last who will be first and
some of the first who will be last." Luke.

18:09.007 --> 18:10.304
I was quoting Matthew.

18:10.375 --> 18:13.902
You were misquoting Matthew.
Matthew says "many," not "some."

18:14.312 --> 18:17.008
You certainly understand my mission,
Mr. Fox.

18:17.816 --> 18:21.217
And a pretty good knowledge
of the Scriptures, too.

18:21.286 --> 18:24.687
I've tinkered a bit with the Bible.
God's owner's handbook, isn't it?

18:24.756 --> 18:26.348
Except it doesn't work.

18:29.794 --> 18:32.922
So, this is your first visit to Mosquitia?

18:33.798 --> 18:36.926
Actually it's more than a visit.
We're planning to stay.

18:38.436 --> 18:39.562
Stay there?

18:40.839 --> 18:42.397
Why would you want to?

18:42.474 --> 18:44.635
That whole country's back
in the Stone Age.

18:44.709 --> 18:45.971
Sounds perfect.

18:51.750 --> 18:52.876
Mr. Fox!

18:53.385 --> 18:56.252
There you are. I've got a gift for you.

18:56.321 --> 18:59.381
It's the latest. The Blue Jeans Bible.

19:03.595 --> 19:05.825
It was designed by a psychologist.

19:06.264 --> 19:10.166
Look at this, kids. It's just what I've been
warning you about.

19:10.935 --> 19:15.838
"Of making many books there is no end.
Much study is a weariness of the flesh."

19:15.974 --> 19:17.373
Ecclesiastes.

19:18.209 --> 19:22.873
"There are many rooms in
my Father's house, but I am the door."

19:23.748 --> 19:25.943
Don't slam it on the way out.

19:28.887 --> 19:30.650
May God forgive you.

19:30.922 --> 19:32.253
Have a nice day.

19:32.557 --> 19:34.388
Thank you. I will, Brother!

19:52.210 --> 19:53.074
Hi.

19:55.146 --> 19:58.206
It's a whole lot hotter than this
in the jungle.

19:59.951 --> 20:02.920
- You've never been there, have you?
- No.

20:06.691 --> 20:08.249
We're from Baltimore.

20:09.160 --> 20:11.185
I study communication in school.

20:11.930 --> 20:14.490
I hate school. It's so boring.

20:17.635 --> 20:19.193
What's your favorite band?

20:19.270 --> 20:22.899
Mine's The Executioners.
I love the lead guitarist. He is so cool.

20:23.708 --> 20:25.505
He reminds me of James Dean.

20:25.577 --> 20:28.307
Your father's a missionary.
You don't live in Baltimore.

20:28.379 --> 20:29.368
Yes, we do.

20:29.848 --> 20:33.875
My father has two churches. One's in
Guampu, and the other one is in Baltimore.

20:33.952 --> 20:35.283
It's a drive-in.

20:35.854 --> 20:37.412
What kind of drive-in?

20:39.424 --> 20:43.258
There's only one kind.
You know, outdoors with cars.

20:44.796 --> 20:46.559
Gosh, you're stupid.

20:50.235 --> 20:52.032
So, what's your old man do?

20:55.740 --> 20:57.401
My father's an inventor.

20:58.810 --> 21:02.405
He invented this mechanical mop.
You sort of dance around with it.

21:02.547 --> 21:04.674
It works by itself. You have to see it.

21:04.749 --> 21:05.738
Weird.

21:06.818 --> 21:08.615
My father's a genius.

21:13.992 --> 21:15.118
Charlie.

21:16.661 --> 21:18.356
Do you have a girlfriend?

21:19.397 --> 21:20.261
No.

21:22.834 --> 21:25.496
I could be your girlfriend, if you want.

21:28.039 --> 21:30.564
I think about you
when I go to the bathroom.

22:06.110 --> 22:07.475
Come here, honey.

22:10.048 --> 22:14.007
"He's all right
What do you think about Jesus?

22:14.519 --> 22:18.478
"He's all right
What do you think about Jesus?

22:18.823 --> 22:20.757
"He's all right...."

22:22.527 --> 22:23.585
Where's my bag?

22:23.661 --> 22:26.186
Honey, look at this place! It's beautiful!

22:28.566 --> 22:30.295
- Everybody ready?
- Yeah!

22:32.003 --> 22:34.494
I think about you
when I go to the bathroom.

22:37.141 --> 22:39.109
Jeedoof!

22:39.510 --> 22:40.477
Jeedoof!

22:40.645 --> 22:42.875
- Amen!
- Amen!

22:43.014 --> 22:45.710
All right, Mother,
let's get this show on the road.

22:45.783 --> 22:48.752
Come on, kids, let's go.
Everybody's got a long way to go.

22:48.820 --> 22:49.980
Let's go!

22:58.162 --> 23:01.097
Look at him, Charlie.
I love him when he's like that.

23:01.833 --> 23:03.232
Happy hunting, Reverend.

23:03.368 --> 23:06.201
Thank you very much, Mr. Fox,
and you, too.

23:21.319 --> 23:23.514
- Look at all the boats.
- They're beautiful.

23:23.588 --> 23:25.715
Hey, sweet peas, come to Papa.

24:32.223 --> 24:33.747
The twins are asleep.

24:34.292 --> 24:35.520
Tell her, Charlie.

24:35.593 --> 24:37.618
- Dad bought a town.
- You're joking.

24:37.695 --> 24:40.095
- Drunken German.
- He fell asleep.

24:40.164 --> 24:41.631
Not before he signed this.

24:41.699 --> 24:43.860
You're looking at the new mayor
of Jeronimo.

24:43.935 --> 24:45.994
- You bought a town?
- A small town.

24:48.439 --> 24:49.770
Where is it?

24:55.079 --> 24:59.379
Jeronimo? Launches can't go up there.
Too shallow.

24:59.817 --> 25:03.014
Well, Mr. Haddy,
we'll just have to experiment.

25:04.288 --> 25:07.348
Experiment? Why you want to go
to Jeronimo?

25:07.425 --> 25:08.551
We've bought it.

25:08.626 --> 25:11.356
Ran out of room in America, Mr. Haddy.

25:13.164 --> 25:15.359
Here, let me take the wheel.

25:17.001 --> 25:18.730
It's against regulations.

25:19.370 --> 25:21.600
- What regulations?
- It's my launch.

25:22.373 --> 25:24.432
I steer. You passenger.

25:38.890 --> 25:41.017
- Experiment.
- Haddy, you all right there?

25:41.092 --> 25:42.889
There is no channel here.

25:42.994 --> 25:45.428
Don't give up, Haddy. Right?

25:47.832 --> 25:48.992
Stay back!

25:49.934 --> 25:51.526
Stay back! No channel.

25:52.203 --> 25:53.397
Keep looking.

25:54.739 --> 25:56.366
Oh, my God. Mr. Haddy!

25:56.441 --> 25:59.672
- You all right?
- Channel! Channel! Channel!

26:00.311 --> 26:01.403
All right.

26:02.513 --> 26:04.208
Can you get in all right?

26:29.373 --> 26:33.434
"I don't own a VCR
And a house or a car

26:33.644 --> 26:36.340
"And I got no color TV"

27:31.202 --> 27:32.191
Hello!

27:34.839 --> 27:36.170
Them Zambus.

27:36.307 --> 27:38.104
Ask him where we are, Haddy.

27:38.276 --> 27:39.538
It's Jeronimo.

27:39.810 --> 27:41.402
This is it. Jeronimo!

27:42.046 --> 27:42.876
Where?

27:42.947 --> 27:44.073
Stay back there.

27:44.148 --> 27:47.083
Give me room, Son.
Haddy, get ready on the bowline.

27:52.523 --> 27:55.583
- Can we help you?
- I've been looking all over for you.

27:55.660 --> 27:57.594
- Shall I get the luggage?
- Help Mother.

27:57.662 --> 27:59.152
Now, don't run, boys.

27:59.497 --> 28:01.226
Jerry, help me with this.

28:02.166 --> 28:03.531
Careful, girls.

28:03.601 --> 28:06.365
- Can we take our bags?
- No, no, leave them there.

28:12.443 --> 28:14.707
- Can you see the town yet, Allie?
- Yes.

28:16.981 --> 28:19.006
Perfect. It's perfect.

28:20.451 --> 28:23.318
Everything we need is here. Right here.

28:26.958 --> 28:27.947
Yes, yes.

28:30.928 --> 28:32.623
Starting from scratch.

28:36.133 --> 28:38.499
This is what I've always dreamed about.

28:39.637 --> 28:42.572
Don't look at me that way, Mother.
This is our home.

28:43.174 --> 28:45.472
This is life. This is not a vacation.

28:48.713 --> 28:50.374
Can you see it, Charlie?

28:50.581 --> 28:51.707
No, Dad.

28:52.783 --> 28:54.375
Can you see it, Mother?

28:54.652 --> 28:56.176
See what, Allie?

28:57.021 --> 28:59.717
Why, a beautiful house.
Right in front of you.

28:59.824 --> 29:01.519
Me no see no house.

29:03.327 --> 29:07.286
This will do for the kitchen.
That could be the laundry and wash house.

29:07.365 --> 29:11.392
Tie it all together with a platform
and put the sleeping quarters up above.

29:11.936 --> 29:15.428
It's like the hub of a wheel
with the crops radiating out.

29:15.506 --> 29:18.498
I smell a bit of a swamp back there.
We'll have to drain that.

29:18.576 --> 29:21.443
Put a plant there, pump up river water
for the fish farm.

29:21.512 --> 29:22.774
Slash and burn the area.

29:22.847 --> 29:25.281
We have four or five acres
of good growing land.

29:25.349 --> 29:27.476
Boy, have we got some work to do.

29:36.927 --> 29:38.918
I don't want to hit you.

29:38.996 --> 29:40.827
Perhaps if I hit them...

29:41.832 --> 29:43.265
...and you take them out.

29:43.334 --> 29:44.767
- Let me hold.
- Okay.

29:52.943 --> 29:55.309
Okay, take that away, will you?

29:57.448 --> 30:00.349
Dad, there's a big pile of cut wood here.

30:00.685 --> 30:02.482
- Wood or lumber?
- Lumber.

30:02.553 --> 30:05.021
Look, girls, look. Come and have a look.

30:05.256 --> 30:08.987
These are wonderful treasures.
Look. Here. You take that.

30:10.027 --> 30:11.585
Look at that. What a beauty.

30:19.670 --> 30:20.659
Mother!

30:22.573 --> 30:23.801
Where is she?

30:26.777 --> 30:31.180
- It's all right, honey. It's all right.
- Leech attack all over this place.

30:31.382 --> 30:35.045
- Some of them baboons bigger than man.
- Okay, Mr. Haddy, thank you.

30:40.358 --> 30:41.655
Oh, my God.

30:42.860 --> 30:44.020
Look at you.

30:44.295 --> 30:45.626
Look at me?

30:46.764 --> 30:47.890
Look at you.

31:15.659 --> 31:16.990
What's that?

31:20.431 --> 31:22.729
I miss my old home in America.

31:23.033 --> 31:24.159
Me, too.

31:27.071 --> 31:29.596
We all do. Now, who wants some orange?

31:30.141 --> 31:31.267
No, thanks.

31:33.644 --> 31:36.772
Nobody loves America more than I do,
you know.

31:37.148 --> 31:40.015
That's why we left,
'cause I couldn't bare to watch.

31:41.452 --> 31:43.716
You kids have got to understand this.

31:45.389 --> 31:47.550
It's like when my mother died.

31:48.926 --> 31:50.553
She'd been strong as an ox.

31:50.628 --> 31:54.462
Fell down, broke her hip, went into
the hospital and caught double pneumonia.

31:54.532 --> 31:57.831
She's laying in bed dying
and I went over and held her hand.

31:57.902 --> 32:00.427
She looked up to me.
You know what she said?

32:02.907 --> 32:05.273
"Why don't you give me some rat poison?"

32:13.284 --> 32:16.253
I couldn't listen. I couldn't watch,
so I went away.

32:17.154 --> 32:20.851
People said I was the height of callousness.

32:22.326 --> 32:23.588
It's not true.

32:24.395 --> 32:27.125
I loved her too much to watch her die.

32:36.173 --> 32:37.868
I'm not here to boss you around.

32:37.942 --> 32:39.466
I'm here to work for you.

32:39.543 --> 32:43.502
And if I'm not working hard enough,
you just tell me and I'll work harder.

32:44.248 --> 32:45.977
You just come up and say:

32:46.183 --> 32:49.118
"Mister, you gotta do
a whole lot better than that."

32:49.687 --> 32:50.813
And I will.

32:51.422 --> 32:54.516
What do you want to do first?
Where do you want to begin?

32:54.592 --> 32:55.786
You tell me.

32:56.227 --> 33:00.493
Fish farm? Chicken run? Bridge?
What? You tell me.

33:09.340 --> 33:10.830
Right. I heard that.

33:11.709 --> 33:14.303
You want to begin with the planting.
That's sensible.

33:14.378 --> 33:16.573
Take care of the animal needs first.

33:16.780 --> 33:19.214
Come along, we've got it all worked out.

33:19.550 --> 33:22.519
Go to your assigned row
according to the colors that...

33:22.586 --> 33:25.646
...you were told about earlier.
These are pumpkin seeds.

33:25.723 --> 33:27.748
About this deep, this far apart.

33:28.025 --> 33:29.788
Jerry, corn for you.

33:34.431 --> 33:37.059
- How are you doing, Charlie?
- All right, Dad.

33:37.134 --> 33:40.331
Right now, someone in America
is pushing an electric squeezer...

33:40.404 --> 33:42.998
...down a garbage disposal
and saying it's busted.

33:43.073 --> 33:45.906
Someone else is opening
a can of chocolate-flavored soup...

33:45.976 --> 33:49.878
...because the car wouldn't start to eat out.
They really wanted a cheeseburger.

33:49.947 --> 33:53.974
- That for true, Father?
- That's right, Francis. That's why I'm here.

33:55.386 --> 33:57.047
That's why I came.

34:23.013 --> 34:26.039
It was not an easy life
those first weeks in Jeronimo.

34:26.550 --> 34:29.576
It was no coconut kingdom of free food
and grass huts...

34:29.652 --> 34:32.121
...and sunny days "under the bam,
under the boo."

34:32.188 --> 34:33.815
Watch the strings, kids.

34:33.891 --> 34:37.657
Good morning, ladies. Let's get up.
I need this tent out of the way.

34:37.795 --> 34:39.853
Charlie, help your mother with the tent.

34:40.797 --> 34:45.201
This was work and more work.
A routine that took up every daylight hour.

34:47.404 --> 34:50.339
In Hatfield we had done pretty much
what we pleased.

34:50.407 --> 34:52.500
Here things were different.

34:57.915 --> 35:00.076
Have you got some flooring up there?

35:00.517 --> 35:03.918
Charlie's supposed to have the flooring
up there for the men to work.

35:03.988 --> 35:06.115
Let's get that lumber up here now.

35:18.836 --> 35:21.896
It's an absolute sin to accept
the decadence of obsolescence.

35:21.972 --> 35:23.769
Why do things get worse?

35:23.841 --> 35:26.241
They don't have to. They could get better.

35:26.310 --> 35:29.006
We accept that things fall apart,
but they don't have to.

35:29.079 --> 35:30.569
Things will last forever.

35:30.648 --> 35:33.583
We eat when we're not hungry,
drink when we're not thirsty.

35:33.684 --> 35:36.881
We buy what we don't need
and throw away everything that's useful.

35:36.954 --> 35:39.422
Why sell a man what he wants?
Sell him what he doesn't need.

35:39.490 --> 35:42.391
Pretend he has eight legs,
two stomachs and money to burn.

35:42.459 --> 35:44.689
It's wrong. Wrong! Wrong!

35:44.762 --> 35:47.697
There are people in New York
who'd kill you for a quarter.

35:47.765 --> 35:51.326
You don't dare take a walk for fear
somebody'll stick a knife in your ribs.

35:51.402 --> 35:53.734
Stay home and they come in
through the windows.

35:53.804 --> 35:56.398
Ten-year-old homicidal maniacs
on every corner.

35:56.473 --> 35:58.031
They go to school.

35:58.108 --> 35:59.598
They go to school.

36:02.613 --> 36:05.810
You know what the biggest problem
with the 20th century is?

36:05.883 --> 36:07.874
People can't stand to be alone.

36:09.453 --> 36:10.750
Can't stand it.

36:21.498 --> 36:24.296
Double-digit inflation
and a $2.00 loaf of bread.

36:27.571 --> 36:28.538
Good.

36:29.406 --> 36:32.239
Great. You're going to be my fish farmer,
Mr. McGregor.

36:32.309 --> 36:34.971
- I think about it.
- Right. You think about it.

36:35.045 --> 36:39.277
We'll breed all the fish we need to eat
right here. It'll be here when we need it.

36:39.349 --> 36:41.476
Just scoop 'em up and put 'em in the pot.

36:41.552 --> 36:45.921
We gotta get this cleared up.
Clear all this trash out of the water.

36:48.425 --> 36:50.188
How am I doing, boy?

36:51.995 --> 36:53.223
Fine, Dad.

37:12.850 --> 37:16.684
Strictly speaking, there's no such thing
as invention, you know.

37:16.920 --> 37:19.445
It's just magnifying what already exists.

37:20.791 --> 37:23.851
Father often talked
of things being revealed.

37:24.261 --> 37:26.593
That was true invention, he said.

37:26.663 --> 37:29.257
Revealing something's use,
and magnifying it.

37:29.700 --> 37:32.294
Discovering it's imperfections
and proving it...

37:32.369 --> 37:34.701
...and putting it to work for you.

37:36.740 --> 37:39.265
God had left the world incomplete, he said.

37:39.576 --> 37:42.238
And it was man's job to understand
how it worked.

37:42.312 --> 37:44.803
To tinker with it and to finish it.

37:44.882 --> 37:47.476
I think that was why
he hated missionaries so much.

37:47.551 --> 37:51.214
Because they taught people
to put up with their earthly burdens.

37:51.855 --> 37:54.756
For Father there were no burdens
that couldn't be fitted...

37:54.825 --> 37:58.283
...with a set of wheels or runners
or a system of pulleys.

37:58.829 --> 38:00.660
- Look what we found.
- Can you help us?

38:00.731 --> 38:03.495
- What have you got, girls?
- Can you fix it?

38:04.701 --> 38:07.067
Yeah, I can get this going.

38:19.349 --> 38:21.613
Don't just sit there, honey, pedal.

38:25.222 --> 38:28.749
No need to worry about
these kids' education, Mother.

38:29.927 --> 38:32.327
This is the education they need.

38:33.430 --> 38:37.594
This is the kind of education
every American should have gotten.

38:38.035 --> 38:41.402
When America's devastated
and laid to waste by nuclear holocaust...

38:41.471 --> 38:44.565
...these are the skills
that are gonna save 'em.

38:45.142 --> 38:49.943
Not finger painting or home economics,
or what is the capital of Texas...

38:51.181 --> 38:52.705
...but survival!

38:53.917 --> 38:57.216
Rebuilding a civilization
from a smoking ruin!

39:04.494 --> 39:06.359
Experiment!

39:07.431 --> 39:09.661
Hey, it's Mr. Haddy, Charlie!

39:09.833 --> 39:12.393
Hey, kids. Good to see you!

39:13.070 --> 39:14.469
How's everything?

39:25.082 --> 39:28.779
They're going to be longer
'cause I'm gonna put cuffs on them, okay?

39:29.887 --> 39:32.048
- Hello, Mr. Peaselee.
- Hello, ma'am.

39:36.760 --> 39:38.694
Can I help you with something?

39:49.840 --> 39:51.865
That is a nice yellow, isn't it?

39:52.075 --> 39:53.940
I surely like this color.

40:02.452 --> 40:03.783
Thank you.

40:16.800 --> 40:17.926
Mr. Fox!

40:21.405 --> 40:23.532
A very good morning to you.

40:24.675 --> 40:25.801
Oh, God!

40:32.449 --> 40:34.041
Well done, Foxes.

40:34.985 --> 40:36.111
Well done.

40:37.587 --> 40:39.145
Mrs. Kennywick...

40:39.756 --> 40:41.087
...is that you?

40:41.224 --> 40:42.816
Yes, sir, Father.

40:43.226 --> 40:47.720
Now, we haven't seen you in God's house
in quite a while.

40:54.838 --> 40:56.100
Jeedoof to you.

40:56.373 --> 40:58.000
Jeedoof to you, Father.

41:01.478 --> 41:03.343
What can we do for you, Reverend?

41:03.413 --> 41:05.711
The word has spread upriver
of your doings.

41:05.782 --> 41:08.910
I thought I'd come and have a look
for myself.

41:09.052 --> 41:11.418
Mrs. Fox. How nice to see you.

41:12.022 --> 41:14.252
- Hello.
- I love your parrot.

41:14.524 --> 41:15.513
It's Arthur.

41:16.727 --> 41:19.890
I brought some preserves from Aurora
specially for you.

41:21.431 --> 41:23.456
Thank you. Will you thank her for me?

41:23.533 --> 41:25.330
Papaya and yams, I believe.

41:27.938 --> 41:32.398
- State your business, Reverend.
- It's the Lord's business I'm about, Mr. Fox.

41:32.876 --> 41:36.812
Is that so? I didn't know the Lord
was franchising in the neighborhood.

41:37.314 --> 41:40.340
The Reverend looks a little hot.
Perhaps some cold tea, Allie?

41:40.417 --> 41:41.406
Mother.

41:41.485 --> 41:44.545
The Lord sent me here, Mr. Fox.

41:45.188 --> 41:49.750
That's what I love about you people,
your complete lack of presumption.

41:50.394 --> 41:53.557
The Lord hasn't any idea this place exits!

41:53.797 --> 41:57.062
If he did, he'd have done something
for these people a long time ago.

41:57.134 --> 41:58.692
But he didn't! I did!

41:58.935 --> 42:00.630
The river doesn't belong to you.

42:00.804 --> 42:03.136
Nor to you! But this place belongs to me...

42:03.206 --> 42:05.697
...and I didn't give you permission
to come ashore!

42:06.910 --> 42:11.438
This man cannot speak for you, good folk!

42:12.516 --> 42:15.349
The Lord is your Father!

42:16.086 --> 42:17.348
I'm a fair man!

42:17.587 --> 42:21.921
If any of you wanna go listen to this man
across the Jeronimo state line...

42:21.992 --> 42:24.460
...I won't stop you! Any takers?

42:33.136 --> 42:35.104
"And Pharaoh said....

42:36.373 --> 42:38.500
"And Pharaoh said:

42:39.376 --> 42:43.836
"'Who is the Lord
that I should obey his voice...

42:44.347 --> 42:47.407
"'...and let you, Israel, go?

42:48.318 --> 42:50.684
"'I know not the Lord...

42:51.521 --> 42:54.513
"'...neither will I let Israel go!"'

42:57.527 --> 42:58.755
Exodus 5.

42:59.162 --> 43:00.925
Now, get off my land.

43:44.474 --> 43:47.238
What Father had promised that first day
in Jeronimo...

43:47.310 --> 43:49.574
...was now there for everyone to see.

43:50.213 --> 43:51.976
It was all as he predicted...

43:52.048 --> 43:55.415
...but more orderly and happier
than we had imagined.

43:56.586 --> 44:00.454
He called this notch in the jungle
"a superior civilization."

44:00.924 --> 44:03.290
"Just the way America might have been,"
he said.

44:44.634 --> 44:47.467
When Mom and Dad come down,
on a count of three, we'll say:

44:47.537 --> 44:49.698
"Happy Thanksgiving," okay?
One, two, three.

44:49.773 --> 44:51.365
Happy Thanksgiving!

44:51.575 --> 44:53.907
- Dad, you look nice.
- You look spackoid!

44:53.977 --> 44:55.239
You look nice!

44:56.613 --> 44:59.275
- You look funny.
- No, he doesn't! He looks nice!

44:59.349 --> 45:01.476
- You look great, Mom!
- You look wonderful.

45:01.551 --> 45:03.246
Have a seat, madam.

45:07.057 --> 45:09.685
- This chicken looks great.
- This is the life!

45:09.993 --> 45:11.893
You've made a wonderful meal.

45:17.534 --> 45:19.900
Our first Thanksgiving in the new world.

45:23.673 --> 45:25.664
- Let's eat!
- This looks really good.

45:25.742 --> 45:29.576
- Can I have some white meat, Dad?
- After your mother. Right, honey?

45:29.913 --> 45:31.642
White, please. Thank you.

45:31.715 --> 45:34.343
The green beans look good.
Everything looks good.

45:40.357 --> 45:41.790
Good-bye, honey.

45:46.730 --> 45:48.129
Good-bye, Dad.

45:48.231 --> 45:50.495
- 'Bye, everybody!
- 'Bye, Dad! See ya!

45:50.567 --> 45:52.262
Are you ready? Come on!

45:53.503 --> 45:54.800
The sandwiches!

45:55.739 --> 45:57.331
They're in the basket!

46:13.123 --> 46:14.249
Come on.

46:19.963 --> 46:23.091
Mr. Haddy, one time,
he told us about this neat cave....

46:23.967 --> 46:27.459
Let me lead the way. I know this jungle
like the back of my hand.

46:29.939 --> 46:31.429
Okay, I'll help you.

46:31.741 --> 46:32.765
Swing!

46:55.465 --> 46:57.660
"Silent night

46:58.134 --> 47:00.261
"Holy night

47:01.037 --> 47:03.096
"All is calm

47:03.907 --> 47:06.000
"All is bright...."

47:07.210 --> 47:10.407
We have to buy our food here
at the camp store. See those nuts?

47:10.480 --> 47:13.711
Gather them and we'll put 'em over here
and we'll use it as a bank.

47:13.783 --> 47:16.047
Okay. Each one is $1.00 U.S.

47:17.921 --> 47:21.084
- I want to buy some food.
- Do you have any money?

47:21.224 --> 47:22.452
Leon got none.

47:22.826 --> 47:24.088
Start diggin'!

47:26.129 --> 47:27.858
I'll be the schoolteacher!

47:28.264 --> 47:31.324
- Let's ask Dad to help when he gets back.
- No.

47:32.168 --> 47:36.434
Dad wouldn't understand.
Don't tell Dad or anyone about Acre.

47:37.240 --> 47:38.104
Why?

47:38.575 --> 47:41.772
'Cause it's our secret.
No one else can know.

47:42.112 --> 47:43.807
Your father can do magic.

47:44.147 --> 47:46.047
It's not magic. It's science.

47:46.182 --> 47:47.376
Science is worse!

47:47.450 --> 47:51.648
You don't know that. My father could have
made a fortune being an inventor.

47:51.821 --> 47:53.550
How come he ain't rich, then?

47:53.623 --> 47:57.582
Because he wanted to come here
and build a town in the jungle, spackoid.

47:57.660 --> 48:00.652
And he said there's gonna be
a nuclear war in America.

48:00.797 --> 48:02.389
You're all wrong.

48:32.462 --> 48:35.056
Father told everyone
he was making a monster.

48:35.799 --> 48:38.597
"I'm Dr. Frankenstein," he used to say.

48:39.636 --> 48:44.403
He called one set of pipes its "lungs"
and another its "poop shaft."

48:45.141 --> 48:49.805
And two tanks, "a pair of kidneys."
He always spoke of the plant as "he."

48:50.380 --> 48:52.177
"He needs a gizzard today."

48:52.248 --> 48:54.716
Or, "This will fit straight onto his liver."

48:54.784 --> 48:56.615
Or, "How's this for his gullet?"

50:42.492 --> 50:43.720
Here, Mama, here!

50:43.793 --> 50:47.126
I want you by my side. There's history
being made here this morning!

50:47.196 --> 50:48.925
Expedition photographers?

50:49.098 --> 50:51.066
Jerry, you got the camera?

50:51.134 --> 50:52.795
Francis, you're in position?

50:54.737 --> 50:56.364
I want you to light Fat Boy.

50:56.439 --> 50:59.897
You're the youngest. You'll live longest
to remember this moment.

50:59.976 --> 51:01.603
Drainy? Mr. Maywit....

51:02.045 --> 51:03.808
We're taking a picture.

51:03.880 --> 51:06.678
Everybody in, Drainy? All righty, smile.

51:43.486 --> 51:44.817
You're waking up.

52:15.752 --> 52:18.778
This is no miracle.
This is thermodynamics.

52:22.725 --> 52:25.694
I hope we don't have
to rescue him, Mother.

52:27.397 --> 52:30.389
It's all right. Allie knows what he's doing.

52:38.141 --> 52:39.608
What that Father got there?

52:39.676 --> 52:41.906
Haven't you ever seen a snowball before?

52:41.978 --> 52:44.105
Ice from fire!

52:47.450 --> 52:48.576
Francis!

52:49.719 --> 52:51.243
That cold water, Father!

52:51.320 --> 52:52.344
Bucky!

52:52.789 --> 52:54.313
And air conditioning!

52:54.991 --> 52:57.516
Cool down your house!
Get a decent night's sleep!

52:57.593 --> 52:58.992
Increase productivity!

52:59.062 --> 53:00.757
Ice is civilization!

53:00.897 --> 53:03.764
That's why I'm here! That's why I came!

53:38.034 --> 53:39.194
Okay, wait!

53:43.673 --> 53:45.004
How many do you want?

53:45.074 --> 53:48.237
Fat Boy looked like a miracle
to the local Zambus.

53:48.377 --> 53:50.538
And a kind of ice market was established.

53:50.613 --> 53:52.342
Everything for free.

53:53.316 --> 53:54.977
But Father was restless.

53:55.785 --> 53:57.412
It was all too easy now...

53:57.487 --> 54:00.684
...and everyone was taking his ice
for granted.

54:00.990 --> 54:03.322
Then Francis told him
about an Indian tribe...

54:03.392 --> 54:05.917
...a half a day's march into the mountains.

54:06.195 --> 54:08.959
People who had never seen missionaries
or anyone else...

54:09.031 --> 54:11.932
...and they had certainly never seen ice.

54:12.001 --> 54:15.027
These were the pure people
he had talked of in Hatfield.

54:15.104 --> 54:17.902
Friendly savages who would see his ice...

54:18.775 --> 54:21.209
...as a jewel, and be amazed.

54:21.711 --> 54:23.008
Keep goin'.

54:24.313 --> 54:26.372
Don't give up on me, boys.

54:43.499 --> 54:44.591
Watch out!

54:53.509 --> 54:55.841
Put it down if you have to! Put it down!

54:59.916 --> 55:03.010
Okay, Charlie. Come up here.
Hold it up here. Hold it.

55:03.085 --> 55:04.382
Come on up!

55:06.656 --> 55:09.056
Hold it! Hold it, Francis.

55:13.396 --> 55:15.125
Okay, get out of the way.

55:16.566 --> 55:18.693
Don't get your legs underneath it.

55:27.310 --> 55:28.800
Come on, Jerry!

55:45.862 --> 55:48.763
Just over this ridge. It's all downhill.

55:52.802 --> 55:54.531
What's the matter with you guys?

55:54.604 --> 55:57.095
- We'll have to go home in the dark.
- Home?

55:58.040 --> 56:01.305
We're not going anywhere
until we deliver this ice!

56:30.406 --> 56:33.864
All right, we'll camp here. Put it down.

56:43.419 --> 56:45.250
So, where are we gonna sleep?

56:46.055 --> 56:47.682
Right over there.

56:48.691 --> 56:51.387
Across the street. At the Holiday Inn!

56:51.761 --> 56:55.822
You two kids can lounge by the pool
while I fix us up with a couple of rooms.

56:55.898 --> 56:58.890
You want a king-size bed, don't you?
I know I do.

56:58.968 --> 57:01.334
I sure hope there's a color TV.

57:01.771 --> 57:05.502
Want a roll of quarters, Jerry,
for the jukebox? Play a few tunes?

57:07.243 --> 57:12.010
I'm so sick of this whining from you!
Pull yourself together! Be a man!

57:22.224 --> 57:24.249
Come on, Jerry. It's all right.

57:24.327 --> 57:26.522
There goes Charlie to get a Fudgesicle.

57:26.595 --> 57:28.324
Careful crossing the road.

57:28.831 --> 57:31.857
I'm looking for some wood
to build a lean-to.

57:31.934 --> 57:35.165
Hear that? Charlie's gonna show us
how to build a camp!

57:35.671 --> 57:37.263
Charlie know how.

57:57.660 --> 58:00.094
Put out the fire. You're melting my ice.

58:28.457 --> 58:30.118
What are you looking at?

58:32.395 --> 58:36.422
This is the first time since creation
that ice has ever melted here.

58:37.767 --> 58:38.927
Think about that.

59:03.692 --> 59:04.784
Come on!

59:12.601 --> 59:14.296
Charlie, give me the bag.

59:16.005 --> 59:18.405
I brought for you, present.

59:19.208 --> 59:21.642
Present. Move slowly.

59:21.811 --> 59:24.302
We're the first white men they've seen.

59:24.447 --> 59:26.813
Don't do anything to scare 'em.

59:27.683 --> 59:28.672
Present.

59:29.185 --> 59:31.619
Wonderful, mysterious present.

59:33.689 --> 59:36.522
Come here. Come, look. Look.

59:40.663 --> 59:41.652
Look.

59:44.133 --> 59:45.760
Wait till you see this.

59:46.102 --> 59:47.729
Have a little patience.

59:56.078 --> 59:57.875
I don't believe this.

01:00:01.584 --> 01:00:02.676
This was ice.

01:00:02.751 --> 01:00:03.740
Go away.

01:00:06.322 --> 01:00:09.985
Have you got any idea how hard it is
to drag ice up from the river?

01:00:10.126 --> 01:00:11.093
Go away.

01:00:11.160 --> 01:00:12.593
We go, Father.

01:00:14.096 --> 01:00:15.586
Don't blame me.

01:00:16.065 --> 01:00:18.829
Have you ever seen ice?
Have you ever touched it?

01:00:18.968 --> 01:00:20.902
Dad. There's a white man.

01:00:21.837 --> 01:00:23.930
There's a white man in there.

01:00:24.707 --> 01:00:26.402
Watch me. Watch my back.

01:00:26.475 --> 01:00:28.534
Nice place you got here. Nice.

01:00:29.879 --> 01:00:32.177
Living close to nature. I like that.

01:00:32.915 --> 01:00:34.075
I like that.

01:00:40.856 --> 01:00:43.416
My dad's an inventor,
and he invented this...

01:00:43.492 --> 01:00:46.154
...this big ice machine and it makes ice.

01:00:46.228 --> 01:00:48.321
Yeah, big pieces. Keeps it cool.

01:00:49.598 --> 01:00:52.192
Ice can be used for a number of things.

01:00:52.735 --> 01:00:53.963
Cool your water.

01:00:54.036 --> 01:00:57.699
No, it'll keep your food from rotting.
Makes a great painkiller.

01:00:57.940 --> 01:01:01.239
- It's really cooling.
- Keep you cool on a hot summer day.

01:01:02.378 --> 01:01:04.141
Ice is civilization.

01:01:05.047 --> 01:01:07.777
That's why he came
and that's why he's here.

01:01:10.219 --> 01:01:12.710
Wonderful being here.
Thank you very much.

01:01:13.122 --> 01:01:15.090
We'll be back. Come on, guys.

01:01:15.591 --> 01:01:17.456
We'll bring you some ice!

01:01:17.993 --> 01:01:19.392
- Gracias.
- We'll be back.

01:01:19.461 --> 01:01:21.326
- Gracias.
- More ice!

01:01:24.700 --> 01:01:25.928
Thank you.

01:01:26.535 --> 01:01:27.502
'Bye.

01:01:30.773 --> 01:01:32.240
Don't stop. Don't stop.

01:01:32.308 --> 01:01:33.900
What were they doing?

01:01:34.210 --> 01:01:36.235
Captured. Three guys, prisoners.

01:01:36.312 --> 01:01:39.110
I offered to help spring 'em
but they got their own plan.

01:01:39.181 --> 01:01:43.515
I told 'em to follow our trail to Jeronimo.
They thought we were missionaries.

01:02:06.575 --> 01:02:08.099
What is it, Dad?

01:02:13.115 --> 01:02:15.379
- I'm so glad you're back.
- Spellgood?

01:02:15.451 --> 01:02:17.316
Ma Kennywick and the others
went with him.

01:02:17.386 --> 01:02:20.514
- What happened?
- There wasn't anything I could do.

01:02:20.723 --> 01:02:23.556
Spellgood was raving.
He was talking about hellfire.

01:02:23.626 --> 01:02:26.254
- They were so frightened.
- Very angry at you, Father.

01:02:26.328 --> 01:02:29.320
- They said we were communist.
- We're not communists, honey.

01:02:29.398 --> 01:02:31.593
Very glad you're here, Father.

01:02:31.767 --> 01:02:35.066
It's just jealousy and envy.
You build something up and people...

01:02:35.137 --> 01:02:37.537
...come along and want to take it
away from you.

01:02:49.051 --> 01:02:50.382
Who do that?

01:03:25.287 --> 01:03:27.084
What? What, Francis?

01:03:29.258 --> 01:03:32.159
- Men.
- Talk to me. Tell me what's going on.

01:03:32.394 --> 01:03:34.760
- Ruckboos, Ruckboos.
- Where?

01:03:35.764 --> 01:03:37.288
Calmly, Francis.

01:03:37.866 --> 01:03:40.562
Three Ruckboos. Ruckboos. Three....

01:03:41.203 --> 01:03:43.296
- Dad, what's wrong?
- I don't know.

01:03:43.372 --> 01:03:45.135
Three! Three men. Guns.

01:03:45.240 --> 01:03:47.140
I don't see anybody, Francis.

01:03:47.476 --> 01:03:49.876
I must have drop these. Easy this time.

01:03:50.112 --> 01:03:51.875
Three Ruckboos here.

01:03:52.147 --> 01:03:53.171
Allie!

01:04:17.639 --> 01:04:19.573
We didn't think we'd find you.

01:04:20.409 --> 01:04:21.876
Where are your Zambus?

01:04:22.077 --> 01:04:25.069
Gone. Saw your guns
and thought you were soldiers.

01:04:25.247 --> 01:04:28.182
I didn't get a chance to tell them
you were friendly.

01:04:28.517 --> 01:04:32.214
Probably dipping their arrows in poison
right now. Huh, Charlie?

01:04:32.287 --> 01:04:33.276
Right.

01:04:35.424 --> 01:04:37.187
Where are you going?

01:04:38.861 --> 01:04:41.261
The coast is only a day from here.

01:04:42.564 --> 01:04:44.361
I'll make you a map.

01:04:44.500 --> 01:04:47.060
You can take the cayuka
which is down at the river.

01:04:47.136 --> 01:04:49.764
Take it, it's yours. You'd like it there.

01:04:51.073 --> 01:04:52.597
We like it here.

01:04:54.977 --> 01:04:58.174
I wish there was some place for you
to stay, but we're...

01:04:58.914 --> 01:05:01.007
...infested with ants.

01:05:02.851 --> 01:05:05.149
They're in everything. We've gotta...

01:05:06.522 --> 01:05:08.717
...tear everything down, burn it.

01:05:10.926 --> 01:05:11.950
Charlie!

01:05:12.461 --> 01:05:14.588
I told you to take Maywit's shack down.

01:05:14.663 --> 01:05:17.632
Get a crowbar and get....
Don't run, don't run!

01:05:21.170 --> 01:05:23.798
Take it down and stack it for burning.

01:05:26.942 --> 01:05:28.432
I don't see any ants.

01:05:29.077 --> 01:05:32.740
No, of course you don't.
If you could see them, you could kill them.

01:05:35.651 --> 01:05:38.449
I've got a lot of work to do
and I'm not on vacation.

01:05:38.520 --> 01:05:39.817
We'll look around.

01:05:41.390 --> 01:05:44.985
No, take the cayuka. It's yours.
Take it. Go.

01:05:46.028 --> 01:05:47.689
We'll look around.

01:05:55.003 --> 01:05:56.470
Right, look around.

01:05:58.307 --> 01:06:00.036
Look around all you want.

01:06:16.158 --> 01:06:18.217
Me no see no ants, Father.

01:06:26.201 --> 01:06:29.329
When I make a mistake, I make a good one.

01:06:30.706 --> 01:06:33.766
I thought they were prisoners
of the Indians.

01:06:49.024 --> 01:06:50.787
Are you gentlemen comfortable?

01:06:50.859 --> 01:06:54.056
I mean, the reason I ask is,
I'm terribly sorry...

01:06:54.296 --> 01:06:56.924
...but I'm going to have to ask you
to get up.

01:06:57.499 --> 01:07:00.525
You see, war on the ants! Total war.

01:07:00.769 --> 01:07:04.034
Charlie, bring up the chain saw.
All this furniture.

01:07:04.172 --> 01:07:08.040
Mother, all these pads and things.
These should be boiled.

01:07:09.278 --> 01:07:10.870
Get all the fabric up.

01:07:11.179 --> 01:07:15.206
Get all this furniture. Excuse me.
Hold that for me, will ya?

01:07:15.484 --> 01:07:18.044
Take this stuff off. All the furniture.

01:07:18.887 --> 01:07:20.411
Excuse me, gentlemen.

01:07:23.926 --> 01:07:25.621
Move outta here.

01:07:26.495 --> 01:07:28.292
Get the crowbar.

01:07:35.537 --> 01:07:39.029
- Do we have to burn every chair, Mom?
- Just put it on, Jerry.

01:07:39.107 --> 01:07:43.043
- Do we burn Ma Kennywick's chair, too?
- Termites, darling, termites.

01:07:43.245 --> 01:07:46.578
- She'll be very mad.
- I know, she'll be mad.

01:07:48.984 --> 01:07:52.351
Everything's gotta go.
That's the only way to get rid of them.

01:07:52.421 --> 01:07:54.286
Better not let Ma know.

01:07:54.389 --> 01:07:56.687
Okay for all these things here?

01:07:57.492 --> 01:08:00.222
I can't see them. Maybe they've gone.

01:08:48.276 --> 01:08:49.765
They want some food.

01:08:51.078 --> 01:08:53.479
Oh, God, are we stuck with them?

01:08:55.117 --> 01:08:56.607
Stuck with them?

01:08:57.653 --> 01:08:59.484
We're not stuck with anyone.

01:09:00.087 --> 01:09:02.648
No one who has the slightest spark...

01:09:03.358 --> 01:09:06.327
...has to endure a moment's oppression
in this world.

01:09:06.495 --> 01:09:08.019
What are we gonna do?

01:09:44.566 --> 01:09:47.501
Why do we have to sleep here
and not in our hammocks?

01:09:48.236 --> 01:09:50.703
Because we've got guests tonight.

01:09:51.206 --> 01:09:54.937
Now, you sleep tight, all right,
and I'll be in later on. Okay?

01:09:56.244 --> 01:09:57.438
Night-night.

01:10:02.350 --> 01:10:03.578
Excuse me.

01:10:31.847 --> 01:10:33.178
Right, gentlemen.

01:10:33.548 --> 01:10:35.015
Bunkhouse is ready.

01:10:35.450 --> 01:10:37.714
Get your stuff together and we'll go.

01:10:39.187 --> 01:10:40.449
What bunkhouse?

01:10:45.994 --> 01:10:48.326
Well, it's not much.

01:10:49.464 --> 01:10:51.261
Just the basic necessities.

01:10:54.603 --> 01:10:56.764
But I'm sure you'll be comfortable.

01:11:00.542 --> 01:11:04.410
Breakfast, 7:00 a.m.
Eggs and bacon all around.

01:11:56.498 --> 01:11:58.090
I can't do this alone.

01:11:59.868 --> 01:12:01.733
Get your shoes and follow me.

01:12:39.374 --> 01:12:43.276
They're sleeping. You've got to climb up
to the roof and shove this...

01:12:43.511 --> 01:12:46.105
...through the brackets on the access door.

01:12:47.515 --> 01:12:49.540
You gotta be very, very quiet.

01:12:50.485 --> 01:12:51.747
Can you do it?

01:12:54.723 --> 01:12:55.815
I guess so.

01:12:56.358 --> 01:12:59.794
You gotta be more sure than that.
You could get us all killed.

01:13:01.663 --> 01:13:03.096
Can you do it?

01:13:05.700 --> 01:13:07.497
Yeah, I can do it.

01:13:20.148 --> 01:13:21.376
All right?

01:15:23.438 --> 01:15:25.736
Don't pity those men, Charlie.

01:15:28.643 --> 01:15:31.703
Don't pity this insect. That's not his blood.

01:15:32.847 --> 01:15:34.371
That's my blood.

01:15:56.271 --> 01:16:01.038
I gave them every chance to leave.
If they just lay down, they'll be all right.

01:16:01.743 --> 01:16:03.711
They won't feel a thing.

01:16:05.080 --> 01:16:07.207
In a few moments they'll be frozen solid.

01:16:14.022 --> 01:16:16.957
Why are you making ice this time of night?

01:16:17.292 --> 01:16:19.692
Quiet down, Haddy!
Everybody back in the house!

01:16:19.761 --> 01:16:22.889
- What is it, Mom?
- Do what I say! Inside, all of you!

01:16:24.632 --> 01:16:27.567
They should lay down.
They put a hole in him!

01:16:31.973 --> 01:16:32.803
No.

01:16:51.392 --> 01:16:52.359
Mother!

01:16:52.494 --> 01:16:54.428
Get back inside! Back!

01:16:59.801 --> 01:17:02.531
- Behind the tree!
- Get your heads down!

01:17:56.824 --> 01:17:57.688
Gas!

01:17:57.759 --> 01:17:58.487
Gas!

01:17:58.560 --> 01:17:59.424
Run!

01:18:49.978 --> 01:18:51.377
I'm so sorry.

01:18:52.413 --> 01:18:54.347
I'm happy. We're free!

01:20:16.630 --> 01:20:17.858
My launch!

01:20:23.904 --> 01:20:25.428
Little Haddy.

01:20:26.807 --> 01:20:29.071
She was all I had in the world.

01:20:30.811 --> 01:20:32.972
What good is a boat without a river?

01:20:33.214 --> 01:20:35.011
The river is there, Father.

01:20:37.918 --> 01:20:41.319
It's full of ammonium hydroxide.
Contaminated.

01:20:42.923 --> 01:20:44.322
If we stay here, we die.

01:21:25.099 --> 01:21:26.157
Look, we're here!

01:21:26.233 --> 01:21:28.428
- Look, the ocean!
- We're here!

01:21:42.650 --> 01:21:45.244
I'm going in! I'll race you, Jerry.

01:21:45.552 --> 01:21:47.179
Wait for me, Charlie.

01:21:59.533 --> 01:22:00.693
Let's go!

01:22:06.774 --> 01:22:08.435
My home, that way!

01:22:08.876 --> 01:22:10.844
United States, that way!

01:22:11.011 --> 01:22:13.741
Let's go home! Let's go home!

01:22:17.117 --> 01:22:19.051
Let's go home! Let's go home!

01:22:19.453 --> 01:22:21.478
Clover, Apri! Let's go home.

01:22:21.722 --> 01:22:23.155
We can go home!

01:22:35.135 --> 01:22:36.898
Everything we need is here!

01:22:37.438 --> 01:22:40.373
Right here! We can live simply.

01:22:41.241 --> 01:22:43.266
Gardening, fishing...

01:22:44.278 --> 01:22:45.370
...beach combing.

01:22:45.446 --> 01:22:48.813
I'm a changed man, Mother.
No more chemicals or poisons.

01:22:49.016 --> 01:22:53.009
If what you want isn't washed up
on the beach, you probably don't need it.

01:23:02.529 --> 01:23:06.625
We could take that pipanto
up the coast to Mosquitia.

01:23:07.201 --> 01:23:09.533
We could walk down the beach to Panama.

01:23:11.605 --> 01:23:14.165
Or we could walk up the beach
to Cape Cod.

01:23:14.708 --> 01:23:16.767
Yeah! Let's go to Cape Cod!

01:23:19.880 --> 01:23:21.245
Can we go, Dad?

01:23:21.615 --> 01:23:23.082
No! No!

01:23:24.818 --> 01:23:26.376
We cannot go back!

01:23:30.758 --> 01:23:31.690
Why?

01:23:35.863 --> 01:23:37.831
Because it's not there anymore.

01:23:37.965 --> 01:23:40.024
America's not there anymore.

01:23:41.035 --> 01:23:43.162
What are you talking about?

01:23:43.404 --> 01:23:46.862
A cataclysm. A blinding flash.
The end of that world.

01:23:47.307 --> 01:23:49.605
No, darling, that was Jeronimo.

01:23:49.843 --> 01:23:53.108
No, no. I'm talking about
the United States of America.

01:23:55.749 --> 01:23:58.775
Millions of Americans burned to a crisp.

01:24:00.654 --> 01:24:03.623
The flesh just melted off their bones.

01:24:05.726 --> 01:24:07.694
Why are you doing this to us?

01:24:07.761 --> 01:24:11.356
I'm not doing anything.
I'm our salvation. I rescued us.

01:24:11.698 --> 01:24:13.427
Is America really blown away?

01:24:13.500 --> 01:24:15.866
Did they have a nuclear war up there?

01:24:21.108 --> 01:24:22.040
Mom.

01:24:22.876 --> 01:24:25.674
No. It's all right, darlings. He's just joking.

01:24:25.746 --> 01:24:27.441
It's just a joke.

01:24:28.415 --> 01:24:29.643
Some joke.

01:24:46.433 --> 01:24:48.924
Me can't take your Omega, Father.

01:24:49.603 --> 01:24:51.468
I got no use for it anymore.

01:24:56.410 --> 01:24:59.538
You take it.
You've been a good friend to us.

01:25:01.648 --> 01:25:02.945
Experience!

01:25:04.284 --> 01:25:07.651
But you'd like my place,
just down the coast.

01:25:08.655 --> 01:25:10.316
They're my family.

01:25:11.125 --> 01:25:12.353
No, Haddy.

01:25:14.528 --> 01:25:16.996
If it's on a map, I can't use it.

01:25:22.536 --> 01:25:26.336
I knew Father had lied to us
about America being blown up.

01:25:26.940 --> 01:25:30.569
That lie made me feel lonelier
than I had ever felt before.

01:25:32.946 --> 01:25:35.107
I wanted to take hold of him...

01:25:35.215 --> 01:25:38.878
...to tell him I loved him and would stay
and work beside him forever...

01:25:38.952 --> 01:25:41.318
...if only he would take back the lie.

01:25:49.563 --> 01:25:52.031
Mom, how long are we gonna be here?

01:25:57.104 --> 01:26:00.562
Has Hatfield and Mr. Polski
and our chickens and all America...

01:26:00.741 --> 01:26:02.333
...been blown up?

01:26:06.547 --> 01:26:10.347
If it has, then we're the luckiest people
on earth, aren't we?

01:26:12.352 --> 01:26:13.717
What if it hasn't?

01:26:14.221 --> 01:26:16.485
Then we're making a terrible mistake.

01:26:26.934 --> 01:26:29.402
Somehow, we found what we needed.

01:26:29.770 --> 01:26:33.069
We built a latrine and a hut
and planted a vegetable garden.

01:26:34.107 --> 01:26:38.373
Father's hut was like a small barge.
He took care to make it waterproof...

01:26:39.012 --> 01:26:42.948
...tarring its cracks to seal it
from the rats and moisture.

01:26:43.684 --> 01:26:46.244
He found an old outboard
and took the motor apart...

01:26:46.320 --> 01:26:48.618
...cleaning it piece by piece.

01:26:49.990 --> 01:26:54.484
Father was fond of saying that in the end,
Robinson Crusoe went back home.

01:26:56.263 --> 01:26:58.026
But we were staying.

01:27:31.665 --> 01:27:33.155
It's Mr. Haddy.

01:27:33.834 --> 01:27:34.926
Greetings.

01:27:36.169 --> 01:27:37.534
Hi, how are you?

01:27:37.771 --> 01:27:39.238
Hello, baby, hello.

01:27:39.606 --> 01:27:41.733
Haddy, what a surprise.

01:27:43.343 --> 01:27:47.006
This is a very different kind of experiment.
Very different.

01:27:47.080 --> 01:27:49.412
It doesn't look like much
at the moment, but...

01:27:49.483 --> 01:27:52.247
...we have great plans. You know Allie.

01:27:52.319 --> 01:27:54.651
I bring you some turtle meat
and some food.

01:27:54.721 --> 01:27:56.655
Why? Do I look hungry?

01:28:03.063 --> 01:28:04.724
Thanks a lot, Haddy.

01:28:08.669 --> 01:28:10.398
That motor don't have no sparks.

01:28:10.470 --> 01:28:13.439
I bring you some sparkin' gas
the next time.

01:28:14.374 --> 01:28:15.807
Don't want it.

01:28:17.010 --> 01:28:18.170
How is that?

01:28:18.245 --> 01:28:20.509
Because I don't need your charity.

01:28:25.986 --> 01:28:27.613
You're too close to the water.

01:28:27.688 --> 01:28:28.780
It's over there.

01:28:28.855 --> 01:28:30.880
Gonna be up here when rain come.

01:28:31.458 --> 01:28:35.053
We gonna get some storm.
Gonna cover all over the junk pile there.

01:28:36.730 --> 01:28:39.528
Who made that trash pile?
Monkeys do that?

01:28:43.103 --> 01:28:45.128
Tell us how you lost your watch.

01:28:45.205 --> 01:28:48.606
I swapped it for my new boat.
A sailboat. You want to see?

01:28:49.042 --> 01:28:49.906
No.

01:28:50.944 --> 01:28:54.107
I call her Omega like the watch.

01:28:54.414 --> 01:28:56.348
She is a pretty thing.

01:28:56.817 --> 01:28:59.217
I had that watch 15 years.

01:29:00.854 --> 01:29:03.186
It's 3:00, 3:30.

01:29:03.824 --> 01:29:05.416
You just gave it away.

01:29:05.659 --> 01:29:08.059
I thought you approved
of that kind of thing.

01:29:08.128 --> 01:29:11.791
Haddy, can't you see?
We've got work to do here.

01:29:16.103 --> 01:29:18.094
You're in trouble here, Father.

01:29:18.472 --> 01:29:21.168
Rain gonna wash the experiment
out to sea.

01:29:22.209 --> 01:29:24.973
Ma and the kids could come to Brewer's.

01:29:26.480 --> 01:29:28.209
Good for the family there.

01:29:29.750 --> 01:29:32.617
He's telling me it's too dangerous here.

01:29:32.753 --> 01:29:34.687
This savage is telling me--

01:29:34.821 --> 01:29:36.948
Don't talk to Mr. Haddy like that.

01:29:38.792 --> 01:29:40.760
We live here. Get that?

01:29:41.561 --> 01:29:43.756
This is a pioneering effort.

01:29:44.164 --> 01:29:46.029
I want to go with Mr. Haddy.

01:29:47.401 --> 01:29:48.368
What?

01:29:48.735 --> 01:29:50.259
Speak up, Jerry.

01:29:51.104 --> 01:29:53.368
I said I wanted to go with Mr. Haddy.

01:29:54.541 --> 01:29:58.500
Okay, fine. Drop what you're doing,
pack up and get out.

01:29:59.112 --> 01:30:00.909
But don't come back. Ever.

01:30:02.048 --> 01:30:03.879
Never. That's policy.

01:30:07.654 --> 01:30:09.588
See what you've gone and done?

01:30:09.656 --> 01:30:10.623
Good.

01:30:11.458 --> 01:30:14.120
You've got no vision, have you?
None at all.

01:30:14.628 --> 01:30:18.462
You can't see. This is gonna be
a thriving village someday...

01:30:18.598 --> 01:30:21.158
...living in harmony with nature.
That's my vision.

01:30:21.401 --> 01:30:24.666
And anyone without vision
has no place here.

01:30:25.639 --> 01:30:26.628
Anyone.

01:30:33.980 --> 01:30:35.641
He didn't mean it.

01:30:36.249 --> 01:30:38.649
I hate him. I wish he was dead.

01:31:10.050 --> 01:31:11.017
Haddy.

01:31:11.518 --> 01:31:13.850
You won't tell Father I come.

01:31:15.755 --> 01:31:18.553
Sparks and gas for Father's outboard.

01:31:18.725 --> 01:31:20.090
What will I tell him?

01:31:20.160 --> 01:31:23.027
Tell him you found 'em.
Don't mention Haddy.

01:31:23.964 --> 01:31:26.956
You gonna drown without the outboard.

01:31:27.601 --> 01:31:31.537
There gonna be water everywhere.
You hear, Charlie?

01:31:33.540 --> 01:31:35.064
God be with you.

01:32:19.185 --> 01:32:22.211
Charlie, latch the twins to the frame.

01:32:23.790 --> 01:32:25.052
Oh, my God!

01:32:29.696 --> 01:32:32.096
Don't worry, Mother. It'll float!

01:32:32.165 --> 01:32:35.396
Get back inside! I'll get a line to the shore.

01:32:35.669 --> 01:32:37.694
- Get inside!
- Stay with the kids!

01:32:45.412 --> 01:32:46.401
Hold on!

01:32:47.614 --> 01:32:48.842
Hold on to me!

01:32:49.583 --> 01:32:51.551
Everybody hold together!

01:33:03.597 --> 01:33:04.586
Hold on!

01:33:26.319 --> 01:33:28.446
We're floating out to sea!

01:33:32.559 --> 01:33:33.685
Oh, God!

01:33:53.813 --> 01:33:55.747
I found them last week.

01:34:02.756 --> 01:34:04.280
I've got control!

01:34:04.357 --> 01:34:05.346
Haddy's.

01:34:06.226 --> 01:34:08.751
We could go downstream to Haddy's.

01:34:09.095 --> 01:34:12.064
No! Dead things go downstream, Mother.

01:34:12.365 --> 01:34:13.855
Life is upstream!

01:35:11.024 --> 01:35:14.050
Mother, don't give 'em too much coconut.

01:35:14.694 --> 01:35:16.127
Light rations.

01:35:18.465 --> 01:35:20.456
Don't know when we'll eat next.

01:35:30.910 --> 01:35:31.899
Damn it.

01:35:32.078 --> 01:35:35.377
Shear pin's gone.
Prop's gone to the bottom. Boys!

01:35:35.615 --> 01:35:38.880
Come here with your poles.
Get a reference on the shore.

01:35:40.553 --> 01:35:42.350
Hold it where we are!

01:36:01.841 --> 01:36:03.172
Where is he?

01:36:04.711 --> 01:36:06.838
He's been down a long time.

01:36:17.023 --> 01:36:19.184
- He's gone.
- Jerry, can you see him?

01:36:20.794 --> 01:36:23.957
He's somewhere.
He has to be somewhere.

01:36:26.132 --> 01:36:27.531
Dad, come on.

01:36:29.903 --> 01:36:31.768
Well, I don't see him.

01:36:35.809 --> 01:36:36.833
Dad!

01:36:37.777 --> 01:36:39.244
Where are you, Dad?

01:36:42.682 --> 01:36:45.776
I can't stand this!

01:36:47.020 --> 01:36:49.989
We'll be all right. We'll be all right.

01:36:53.393 --> 01:36:55.156
We'll be all right.

01:36:59.566 --> 01:37:01.864
We can go downstream
and find Mr. Haddy.

01:37:01.935 --> 01:37:04.335
Jerry's right. Let's go! Let's turn around.

01:37:04.404 --> 01:37:06.599
Right, let's get outta here!

01:37:07.540 --> 01:37:08.700
Traitors.

01:37:23.022 --> 01:37:26.890
As punishment, Jerry and I were towed
behind the houseboat.

01:37:28.094 --> 01:37:31.586
Father sat at the end of the towline,
his back to us.

01:37:31.664 --> 01:37:35.998
I hated his shoulders, his greasy hair,
the slant of his spine.

01:37:36.903 --> 01:37:41.772
I imagined how it would be to stick a knife
in it, just below his ragged collar.

01:37:44.644 --> 01:37:47.613
Yes, it's punishment.
Necessary punishment.

01:37:49.082 --> 01:37:52.882
No, it's not. Now you bring those children
back onboard!

01:37:53.620 --> 01:37:56.919
Are you in charge now, Mother?
If you are, just say so.

01:37:56.990 --> 01:38:00.687
Can you survive in this jungle?
Can you get us out of here?

01:38:00.760 --> 01:38:04.127
- If so, where would you go?
- I'd go to Brewer's, to Mr. Haddy's.

01:38:04.197 --> 01:38:05.824
And live like a savage?

01:38:08.401 --> 01:38:09.993
I'd really rather die.

01:38:12.238 --> 01:38:15.867
There's no shame to be the last to go.
It just proves my point.

01:38:19.746 --> 01:38:21.976
I'm doing this for all of us.

01:38:22.582 --> 01:38:24.516
I'm doing this for you.

01:38:38.431 --> 01:38:40.126
I wish I could kill him.

01:38:40.867 --> 01:38:44.268
He wouldn't be so hard to kill.
Sneak up, hit him with a hammer!

01:38:44.337 --> 01:38:45.269
Be quiet!

01:38:45.338 --> 01:38:46.896
Stop talking like that.

01:38:47.707 --> 01:38:49.072
You're thinking it, too.

01:38:49.142 --> 01:38:50.166
No, I'm not!

01:38:50.910 --> 01:38:53.208
You can just stop talking like that.

01:38:56.115 --> 01:38:57.605
I wish he were dead!

01:38:57.717 --> 01:38:59.207
Be quiet, okay?

01:39:06.292 --> 01:39:07.725
Just be quiet.

01:39:11.431 --> 01:39:12.693
I'm sorry.

01:39:36.055 --> 01:39:37.886
Beautiful country, eh, Mother?

01:39:37.957 --> 01:39:41.415
We could live anywhere around here.
Live like kings.

01:39:42.829 --> 01:39:47.027
I know what you're thinking.
You're thinking it's better upstream.

01:40:31.878 --> 01:40:33.846
Are those angels, Mommy?

01:40:47.727 --> 01:40:50.719
"Blessed Jesus

01:40:53.666 --> 01:40:57.067
"Blessed Jesus

01:41:00.106 --> 01:41:04.907
"Thou has God as thy reward"

01:41:07.947 --> 01:41:10.438
They're missionaries! They could help us.

01:41:12.785 --> 01:41:14.480
We don't need help!

01:41:14.821 --> 01:41:16.118
Look at us!

01:41:21.561 --> 01:41:24.587
Well done, choir! Well done!

01:41:25.198 --> 01:41:27.359
Welcome in Jeedoof.

01:41:28.134 --> 01:41:29.226
Spellgood.

01:41:29.368 --> 01:41:31.165
We'll see about this!

01:41:44.250 --> 01:41:45.444
What will you do?

01:41:45.518 --> 01:41:48.681
I'm gonna knock his block off!
That's what I'm gonna do!

01:41:51.791 --> 01:41:52.758
Look!

01:41:52.859 --> 01:41:55.919
Barbed wire.
A Christian concentration camp.

01:42:02.401 --> 01:42:04.892
They have a backboard!
They play basketball!

01:42:04.971 --> 01:42:06.836
They have real houses.

01:42:08.241 --> 01:42:10.971
Look at these toys!
Can we play with them?

01:42:11.644 --> 01:42:13.669
...you could be here today.

01:42:14.614 --> 01:42:17.583
Now, brothers and sisters...

01:42:18.885 --> 01:42:21.877
...we all know the story of Gideon...

01:42:22.889 --> 01:42:25.357
...how in his hour of darkness...

01:42:26.025 --> 01:42:27.617
...he called upon God...

01:42:28.461 --> 01:42:30.361
...to help spite his enemies.

01:42:31.864 --> 01:42:35.095
Then, he blew his trumpet...

01:42:39.906 --> 01:42:40.930
...and...

01:42:45.077 --> 01:42:46.806
...that was that!

01:42:47.947 --> 01:42:49.881
He called on God.

01:42:50.850 --> 01:42:54.342
Just as simple as making a telephone call.

01:42:56.956 --> 01:42:59.220
Now, I want you...

01:43:00.293 --> 01:43:05.253
...to think of prayer as beingjust as simple
as making a telephone call.

01:43:13.072 --> 01:43:14.061
Hello?

01:43:14.273 --> 01:43:16.104
God? It's Gurney.

01:43:16.742 --> 01:43:18.607
I was calling you because....

01:43:19.145 --> 01:43:20.169
Hello?

01:43:20.680 --> 01:43:22.841
Look at them. The Maywits.

01:43:25.351 --> 01:43:26.841
- Sometimes...
- Brainwashed.

01:43:26.919 --> 01:43:29.183
...the line is cut.

01:43:31.257 --> 01:43:35.091
What do you do when the line is cut?

01:43:35.761 --> 01:43:37.661
You ring again!

01:43:41.667 --> 01:43:43.760
God? It's me again.

01:43:46.138 --> 01:43:49.369
Now, I do have a little problem.
Well, yeah....

01:43:49.642 --> 01:43:51.109
I know you're very busy....

01:43:52.278 --> 01:43:53.609
Back to the boat.

01:44:11.931 --> 01:44:15.924
Hey, kids. Okay, settle down!
We're all tired, okay?

01:44:16.669 --> 01:44:19.900
I want to watch TV.
I want to watch my show now!

01:45:19.465 --> 01:45:20.489
Emily!

01:45:21.500 --> 01:45:23.468
It's me, Charlie Fox and Jerry.

01:45:25.171 --> 01:45:26.832
What are you doing here?

01:45:29.942 --> 01:45:31.375
We're goin' upriver.

01:45:31.444 --> 01:45:34.845
This is weird. My dad said you were
hanging out with Zambus...

01:45:34.914 --> 01:45:37.644
...and running around nude-o
and climbing trees.

01:45:40.753 --> 01:45:43.916
What happened to you?
You look disgusting!

01:45:45.391 --> 01:45:46.983
You got smaller.

01:45:47.426 --> 01:45:48.893
Your hair's gross.

01:45:50.596 --> 01:45:51.961
Is America okay?

01:45:53.332 --> 01:45:57.200
Baltimore's freaky now.
They closed Dad's drive-in church.

01:45:58.003 --> 01:45:59.334
Was there a war?

01:45:59.572 --> 01:46:01.130
Are you nuts or something?

01:46:01.207 --> 01:46:04.904
My father said America was blown up.
Nobody left but us.

01:46:05.344 --> 01:46:06.777
That's stupid.

01:46:07.146 --> 01:46:10.172
It all went up in flames.
That's what he told us.

01:46:11.417 --> 01:46:13.248
I thought my dad was weird.

01:46:13.386 --> 01:46:16.321
- He was lying to us all the time!
- Be quiet!

01:46:16.756 --> 01:46:20.123
It's the generator. It happens all the time.
It must be out of gas.

01:46:20.192 --> 01:46:21.250
Come here.

01:46:21.327 --> 01:46:22.419
Generator!

01:46:24.964 --> 01:46:28.161
It's okay. It's all right. It's okay.

01:46:32.972 --> 01:46:34.337
It's okay, really.

01:46:37.042 --> 01:46:38.839
Emily, we're in trouble.

01:46:43.749 --> 01:46:45.114
Will you help us?

01:46:57.596 --> 01:46:59.063
Where have you been?

01:47:00.900 --> 01:47:04.233
- Where's Dad?
- I thought he was with you.

01:47:04.637 --> 01:47:07.663
He lied to us, Mom. America's still there.

01:47:08.107 --> 01:47:09.267
Oh, baby.

01:47:09.442 --> 01:47:11.501
- Mother, I'm leaving.
- So am I.

01:47:12.077 --> 01:47:14.409
- What do you mean?
- The Spellgoods have a jeep.

01:47:14.480 --> 01:47:16.675
Emily gave me the keys. Let's go.

01:47:17.917 --> 01:47:20.545
You mean, leave Dad behind? No!

01:47:22.288 --> 01:47:23.619
- Mother, please!
- No.

01:47:23.689 --> 01:47:27.216
Please, listen to me.
This might be your last chance.

01:47:27.393 --> 01:47:31.295
Let's get the twins and let's get out of here
before he tries to stop us.

01:47:31.363 --> 01:47:32.352
No.

01:47:33.032 --> 01:47:33.999
No, I can't.

01:47:34.066 --> 01:47:35.829
- Please!
- Tomorrow'll be too late!

01:47:35.901 --> 01:47:37.630
- Please.
- I can't.

01:47:51.283 --> 01:47:52.272
Allie.

01:48:00.726 --> 01:48:02.921
Father, Father! TV's on fire!

01:48:04.230 --> 01:48:06.164
Charlie, get the twins.

01:48:10.035 --> 01:48:11.764
Wake up, come on! Wake up!

01:48:13.539 --> 01:48:16.269
It's all right, girls. Come on, sweetheart.

01:48:16.342 --> 01:48:20.608
It's all right. It's all right. Don't worry.
We're just going....

01:48:25.885 --> 01:48:28.376
Don't worry. I got some gas.

01:48:28.988 --> 01:48:31.456
I guess I must have spilled some.

01:48:31.690 --> 01:48:34.716
Start the generators! Get the hoses going!

01:48:36.295 --> 01:48:37.592
Communists.

01:48:38.564 --> 01:48:41.533
Charlie, let go of the bowline.
We're getting out of here.

01:48:41.901 --> 01:48:42.731
Dad.

01:48:43.102 --> 01:48:44.069
What?

01:48:45.738 --> 01:48:47.000
We're not going with you.

01:48:47.072 --> 01:48:47.868
What?

01:48:47.940 --> 01:48:49.202
You're a liar.

01:48:49.275 --> 01:48:52.767
- Charlie's got a plan. Listen to him.
- Don't you turn against me, Mother.

01:48:52.845 --> 01:48:54.813
Allie, you're killing us!

01:48:55.047 --> 01:48:58.539
You've always been against me.
You're no better than these kids!

01:49:07.860 --> 01:49:08.884
I'm sorry.

01:49:11.664 --> 01:49:12.824
- Come on.
- No.

01:49:12.898 --> 01:49:14.957
Come on, let's get off the boat.

01:49:16.936 --> 01:49:17.925
Mother!

01:49:38.457 --> 01:49:39.754
It's all right.

01:49:40.125 --> 01:49:41.922
It's all right, my darling.

01:49:43.295 --> 01:49:44.592
It's all right.

01:49:45.598 --> 01:49:47.463
Gurney, we got the pump on!

01:49:52.171 --> 01:49:56.164
You see what that says over that door?
It says, "Hallelujah!"

01:52:06.605 --> 01:52:08.368
How am I doing, Son?

01:52:10.843 --> 01:52:12.071
Fine, Dad.

01:52:15.848 --> 01:52:18.043
I can't move. Just my head.

01:52:20.586 --> 01:52:22.247
You'll get better.

01:52:24.723 --> 01:52:27.089
Man sprang from a faulty world, Charlie.

01:52:28.761 --> 01:52:31.127
It's a bad design, the human body.

01:52:32.664 --> 01:52:36.828
The skin's not thick enough.
Too little hair, no claws or fangs.

01:52:38.303 --> 01:52:40.828
We weren't meant to stand upright.

01:52:41.273 --> 01:52:43.400
It exposes our heart and genitals.

01:52:45.210 --> 01:52:47.075
Should be on all fours.

01:52:47.679 --> 01:52:49.613
Hairier with tails.

01:52:52.785 --> 01:52:55.083
Look at me. Yes, sir.

01:52:57.356 --> 01:52:59.824
I'm going to be on all fours from now on.

01:53:03.195 --> 01:53:04.856
I don't want Dad to die.

01:53:04.930 --> 01:53:06.727
I know that. I know.

01:53:12.404 --> 01:53:13.769
Nature's crooked.

01:53:15.808 --> 01:53:17.799
I wanted right angles...

01:53:20.245 --> 01:53:21.644
...straight lines.

01:53:24.449 --> 01:53:27.350
You cut yourself opening a can of tuna
and you die.

01:53:33.392 --> 01:53:35.587
Are we still going upriver, Mother?

01:53:42.768 --> 01:53:44.167
Yes, darling.

01:54:04.056 --> 01:54:06.047
Once I had believed in Father...

01:54:06.658 --> 01:54:10.219
...and the world had seemed small and old.

01:54:11.730 --> 01:54:16.133
Now he was gone and I wasn't afraid
to love him anymore.

01:54:18.136 --> 01:54:21.663
And the world seemed limitless.
