She made Frank

00:31.380 --> 00:33.914
and he returned
the dish unwashed.

You mean to focus one's
attention or mental effort

Nothing at all,
unless you want to feel

04:47.203 --> 04:49.970
like the first time you smoked.

04:57.580 --> 04:59.413
Montrel, you look tense.

You need to relax,
and I know just the trick.

05:02.084 --> 05:03.951
You know I don't touch
that shit, Mahogony.

06:08.851 --> 06:10.050
Hey, ass lizards!

06:10.052 --> 06:11.919

06:18.961 --> 06:20.327
But don't let it go to your head.

You got Grover and Jamal

06:22.498 --> 06:25.599
Get it?
'Cause they suck your [bleep].

Got all kind of misspelled
words in this thing.

06:42.451 --> 06:45.185
It's either from Floyd
Mayweather or 2 Chainz.

"Whoever this is, everybody
know what I did last night.

06:48.257 --> 06:51.959
'Cause I do dope shit."

all this energy just to be lazy.

Aye, if I wanted to hear a tiny
nigga talk nonsensical nonsense,

07:38.774 --> 07:40.563
I'd listen to a Kendrick Lamar album.

07:40.565 --> 07:42.331
You know, Montrel, I think
you have a lot of potential,

07:42.333 --> 07:44.533
but you need to get it together,
'cause in a few years,

07:44.535 --> 07:46.168
when you actually do
need that diaper changed,

07:46.170 --> 07:47.837
I ain't gonna be the one changing it.

Stall me out.
I got a medical condition.

07:51.676 --> 07:54.143
Yeah, it's called complacency.

I'm telling you, it's
Dyslexic Donny. He crazy.

08:11.796 --> 08:14.263

- He drinks the gravy first.

08:14.265 --> 08:16.265
He don't understand
how mashed potatoes work.

08:16.267 --> 08:18.401
Donny's backward ass

08:18.403 --> 08:20.936
I'll hit him so hard,
I'll make him lexic again.

08:20.938 --> 08:23.305
All right, class.
Settle down, settle down.

08:23.307 --> 08:24.741
Today we're gonna be dissecting

08:24.742 --> 08:27.209

Anybody got any Thousand Island?

08:33.116 --> 08:35.384

- Man, who the hell is you?
- I'm Ted. Special Ted.

09:58.302 --> 10:00.369
What the hell you want,
Special Ted?

10:00.371 --> 10:03.839
- I sent you the texts.
- You're a terrible speller.

10:03.841 --> 10:07.476
I know how to spell
perpetrating the handicap, bitch!

10:09.347 --> 10:10.946
Well, I don't, but...

10:10.948 --> 10:14.617
Anyways, I saw Milk on TV
pretending to be like me

10:14.619 --> 10:17.987
so he could sit courtside last night.

10:18.189 --> 10:20.222
Uh-uh.
You wrong for that.

10:20.224 --> 10:22.224
So we gonna do this or what?

10:22.226 --> 10:25.094
Man, don't be retarded.
I can't fight you, Sling Blade.

10:26.831 --> 10:30.366
You can't not not fight him just
because he's differently abled.

10:30.368 --> 10:32.401
I say whoop his ass, baby!

10:32.403 --> 10:35.538
You ready to feel the wrath
of the baby arm or what?

10:35.540 --> 10:38.207
Yeah, you have to fight him.
Otherwise, it's discrimination.

10:38.209 --> 10:41.143
Aye, I don't discriminate.
How about I beat your ass, then?

10:41.145 --> 10:42.778
Why? Just because
I have two typical

10:42.780 --> 10:45.414
arms and feet like you?
You disgust me, bro!

10:45.416 --> 10:47.683
- Able-ist!
- Having nothing wrong

10:47.685 --> 10:49.251
don't make you all right.

10:49.253 --> 10:52.054
<i>Able-ist!
Able-ist!</i>

10:52.056 --> 10:54.890
Game time's over, homey.
You want to get your ass beat?

10:54.892 --> 10:55.991
'Cause I'm about that life.

10:55.993 --> 10:58.294
After school. Meet me in front.

10:58.296 --> 11:00.396
Ain't nothing but a word. 3:00.

11:00.398 --> 11:02.998
Make it 2:20.
We get out early.

11:03.000 --> 11:04.733
One more thing.

11:04.735 --> 11:07.536
- LeBron's a pussy!
- Aye, hold me back!

11:07.538 --> 11:09.905
<i>Get him, Ted!</i>

11:42.306 --> 11:43.372
Just what I thought.

11:43.374 --> 11:45.341
Still posted up on
the couch doing nothing.

11:45.343 --> 11:47.176
What do you have
to say for yourself?

11:47.178 --> 11:52.414
- Help... me...
- Wait, what'd you say?

11:52.416 --> 11:54.683
Help me, nigga.

11:54.685 --> 11:56.018
You're finally asking for help?

11:56.020 --> 11:58.154
Aw, man, I've been waiting for this

11:58.155 --> 12:00.289
moment my whole life.
I'll be right back.

12:00.291 --> 12:02.024
Okay, we'll start with
"The Black Sea Scrolls"

12:02.026 --> 12:05.594
by Dr. Professor Rashad Muhammad
Abdul Raheem Hightower, D.D.S.

12:05.596 --> 12:08.364
Page one. "In the beginning,
there was black.

12:08.366 --> 12:10.165
And the word was 'black.'"

12:10.167 --> 12:14.737
And, Montrel,
"black" was the word.

12:19.677 --> 12:21.010
<i>Real talk, my nigs.</i>

12:21.012 --> 12:23.145
I'm real conscientious
about this fight.

12:23.147 --> 12:24.780
I'm not just fighting
Drool Moe Dee.

12:24.782 --> 12:25.948
I'm fighting prejudice.

12:25.950 --> 12:27.616
Besides, that's what
the people want.

12:27.618 --> 12:28.651
Oof!

12:28.653 --> 12:30.452
- Ahh! Yo, homey...
- Shut up.

12:30.454 --> 12:31.887
- Mr. Green?
- Look, Milk.

12:31.889 --> 12:35.057
- Please don't fight Special Ted.
- Don't worry, Mr. Green.

12:35.059 --> 12:36.625
I ain't finna [bleep]
him up too bad.

12:36.627 --> 12:38.794
I'll even let him wear
one of them helmets.

12:38.796 --> 12:41.563
No, you dipshit. You're the
one that needs the helmet.

12:41.565 --> 12:43.499
Special Ted has been
terrorizing the school

12:43.501 --> 12:44.867
for the last ten years!

12:44.869 --> 12:46.502
First it was the students,

12:46.504 --> 12:48.437
but then he started
bullying the teachers.

12:48.439 --> 12:50.072
We talking about
the same special kid

12:50.074 --> 12:51.273
that Velcro his Tims?

12:51.275 --> 12:52.975
Listen, I didn't
always have this limp.

12:52.977 --> 12:55.210
See, Ted got tired of
people making fun of him.

12:55.212 --> 12:57.880
So he figured, if you can't
join 'em, beat 'em,

12:57.882 --> 13:00.867
until they're crippled!
You're never gonna win, son.

13:00.868 --> 13:02.351
He's got special needs strength!

13:02.353 --> 13:04.253
Oh, shit.
He gonna kill me, huh?

13:04.255 --> 13:06.755
If you're lucky.
Run, Milk, run!

13:06.757 --> 13:08.390
- Run where?
- It doesn't matter.

13:08.392 --> 13:09.925
Run, damn it, run!

13:09.927 --> 13:13.295
<i>Run while both
your legs still work!</i>

13:15.563 --> 13:17.497
This some bullshit.
I can't win.

13:17.499 --> 13:21.000
- It's a classic double-headed dildo.
- Yeah, you [bleep] both ways.

13:21.002 --> 13:22.853
If you fight him, you're a bully who

13:22.854 --> 13:24.704
picks on special kids.
Nobody'll like you.

13:24.706 --> 13:26.272
You'll probably
have to switch schools

13:26.274 --> 13:27.940
and change your name to Taylor.

13:27.942 --> 13:30.276
- But if you don't fight him...
- Then you a vagina.

13:30.278 --> 13:33.012
No, y'all ain't feeling me.
I can't win, literally!

13:33.014 --> 13:36.282
Special Ted a full-on beast.
He got bodies, yo.

13:36.284 --> 13:39.552
He gonna dogwalk me in front
of the entire school.

13:39.554 --> 13:41.554
Man, I ain't never gonna
get no ass after that.

13:41.556 --> 13:43.723
Oh, you about to be joyful, my nig.

13:43.725 --> 13:45.391
- I got this.
- See?

13:45.393 --> 13:47.293
Knew I could count on you.
What we doing?

13:47.295 --> 13:48.761
Oldest trick in the book.

13:51.799 --> 13:53.432
<i>Hello, you've reached
the Duncan High School</i>

13:53.434 --> 13:55.067
<i>Bomb Threat Hotline.</i>

13:55.069 --> 13:56.636
<i>Your bomb threat is
important to us.</i>

13:56.638 --> 13:58.237
<i>Please stay on the line and...</i>

13:58.239 --> 13:59.772
Oh, well.
Guess this is what you get

13:59.774 --> 14:03.594
for coming at Short Bus Deebo.
Good luck.

14:06.080 --> 14:07.513
And that's how Yakub created

14:07.515 --> 14:10.516
the evil white man
using two magnets.

14:10.518 --> 14:12.718
I know, right? I was speechless
too when I first read it.

14:12.720 --> 14:14.287
That's right, big bro.

14:14.289 --> 14:18.312
Get all those evil white
toxins out your system.

14:19.794 --> 14:22.596
Where you been at? Last time
we saw you you was sitting

14:22.597 --> 14:25.398
in the bathroom stall
crying like a little bitch.

14:25.400 --> 14:28.200
Why you bringing up old shit?
I got a plan now.

14:28.202 --> 14:33.072
- You got Floyd Mayweather?
- I'm looking for a, um... Muh... Mo...

14:33.074 --> 14:35.608
Muh... M... um, one...

14:35.610 --> 14:37.109
[bleep] it.
Which one of y'all is this nigga?

14:37.111 --> 14:38.978
Yeah, that's me, homey.
I'm a real big fan...

14:38.980 --> 14:41.414
[bleep] all that.
You got my paper?

14:41.416 --> 14:43.416
- Now, where is he?
- His name's Ted.

14:43.418 --> 14:45.718
- He in the library.
- Liberry? What's that?

14:45.720 --> 14:48.287
It's like a gym... with books.

14:48.289 --> 14:49.956
Now, that's interesting.
I never heard of it.

14:49.958 --> 14:52.725
He right in there.
Now go beat his ass.

14:52.727 --> 14:54.493
Yeah, I'm looking for Ted.

14:59.901 --> 15:01.667
Told y'all he'd mop his ass up.

15:01.669 --> 15:03.869
That's what I'm talking
about, my nig...

15:05.306 --> 15:08.325
- What the fuh?!
- Guess I just gotta go in there

15:08.326 --> 15:12.078
and holler at Corky myself,
man-to-special-man-like.

15:15.183 --> 15:17.049
Peace offering, homey.
Take it.

15:17.051 --> 15:19.418
Let's squash this beef
like Nicki and Miley.

15:19.420 --> 15:22.688
You want to pay me just
so you don't have to fight?

15:22.690 --> 15:25.324
Call it what you want,
but don't tell nobody.

15:25.326 --> 15:27.059
- I got a rep.
- Hmm.

15:27.061 --> 15:31.697
- I could get a new orthopedic Tim.
- Yeah, get it with extra Velcro.

15:31.699 --> 15:34.100
- Okay, you got a deal.
- Cool.

15:34.102 --> 15:36.636
Maybe I'll even let you kick
it with me once in a blue.

15:36.638 --> 15:39.338
You kidding me?
I don't need your money!

15:39.340 --> 15:42.174
I get plenty of cash
from the government.

15:42.176 --> 15:44.677
Disability, cocksucker.

15:44.679 --> 15:47.613
You're the punkest-ass
white bitch I ever met!

15:47.615 --> 15:50.383
- What did you call me?
- I called you a bitch.

15:50.385 --> 15:52.718
- No, before that.
- Punk-ass?

15:52.720 --> 15:54.687
- No, after that?
- White?

15:54.689 --> 15:56.756
Nobody calls me that.
[bleep] you.

15:56.758 --> 15:59.625
[bleep] close parking, and
[bleep] your personal bathroom.

15:59.627 --> 16:01.427
Well, [bleep] you too,
Meek Milk!

16:01.429 --> 16:04.497
Oh, it's like that?
Okay, okay, you Special Olympics,

16:04.499 --> 16:07.299
slobber-on-the-chin,
HGH-strength-having,

16:07.301 --> 16:08.934
Cuba-Gooding-as-
Radio-idolizing,

16:08.936 --> 16:10.936
graham-cracker-eating
mutha[bleep]!

16:10.938 --> 16:15.074
You Ebonics-talking,
sticker-on-your-cap-wearing,

16:15.076 --> 16:17.877
jeans-sagging,
act-like you-from-the-hood-

16:17.879 --> 16:21.113
but-your-house-has-three-
stories Vanilla Ice,

16:21.115 --> 16:26.619
Slim Shady, Slim Jesus,
wanksta wiggaboo.

16:26.621 --> 16:29.422
That's it. You about
to catch a fade, homey.

16:29.424 --> 16:32.825
The parking lot.
And you better not bitch out.

16:35.496 --> 16:39.598
Oh, God. Just please
don't let him cripple my dick.

16:42.603 --> 16:44.370
Okay, we moving,
but now what you need

16:44.372 --> 16:46.005
is a Spike Lee marathon.

16:46.007 --> 16:47.840
We gonna start
with "Bamboozled," okay?

16:47.842 --> 16:51.010
Hold that pose.
I'll go get the DVDs.

16:53.548 --> 16:55.047
<i>Yo, you know the "D"
to the "R" to the...</i>

16:55.049 --> 16:56.315
<i>Anyways, [bleep] all that.</i>

16:56.317 --> 16:58.517
<i>Just leave a number after
the beep, nigga, damn!</i>

16:58.519 --> 17:00.219
<i>Yo, Montrel, what's up?
It's Kobe.</i>

17:00.221 --> 17:02.288
<i>Is that an answering machine?
Like, with a tape?</i>

17:02.290 --> 17:03.689
<i>Damn, you keeping it really real.</i>

17:03.691 --> 17:05.724
<i>Look, now that Kobe's legs
have betrayed him,</i>

17:05.727 --> 17:07.425
<i>forcing him into retirement,
Kobe was able</i>

17:07.428 --> 17:09.161
<i>to talk Jeannie into giving
you a ten-day contract.</i>

17:09.163 --> 17:11.830
<i>So hit Kobe back ASAP.</i>

17:11.833 --> 17:13.265
<i>Hold it, hold on, hold on.
What did you say, Kobe?</i>

17:13.267 --> 17:15.501
<i>Kobe says I gotta go now.
Kobe!</i>

17:15.502 --> 17:19.505
Boy, you done came up today.
I also have "The Making of 'Bamboozled.'"

17:19.507 --> 17:21.941
Just 25 hours of Spike Lee,
and then we'll finish strong

17:21.943 --> 17:23.026
with the "Where Are We Now?"

17:23.027 --> 17:25.678
Black People's Conference
hosted by Cornel West.

17:25.680 --> 17:28.214
Oh, shit!

17:29.517 --> 17:31.283
You really about to fight this dude?

17:31.285 --> 17:33.152
I have to, homey.
I ain't no punk.

17:33.154 --> 17:35.387
The most successful people
in America is pretenders.

17:35.389 --> 17:37.123
Tupac pretending to be dead.

17:37.125 --> 17:38.657
Drake pretending he can sing.

17:38.659 --> 17:40.693
The WNBA pretending to be a sport.

17:40.695 --> 17:42.328
I was pretending to be disabled.

17:42.330 --> 17:44.130
That's what real ones do.
We pretend.

17:44.132 --> 17:46.966
So you know what I say?
I say let the hustlers play.

17:46.968 --> 17:49.602
And if I have to fight for it,
I'ma fight for it.

17:49.604 --> 17:52.404
Wow! That is some of
the stupidest shit

17:52.406 --> 17:54.373
ever uttered, my nig.

17:54.375 --> 17:56.842
You kind of deserve to catch
a beatdown for that alone.

17:56.844 --> 17:59.614
Man, whatever.
Y'all can't feel my passions.

18:01.149 --> 18:04.550
Hurry up and put this little
shit stain out of his misery!

18:04.552 --> 18:07.987
- Mom's waiting in the car.
- Stop telling me what to do, Thea.

18:07.989 --> 18:12.658
I haven't gotten pussy
like this in a long time.

18:12.660 --> 18:15.735
I plan to enjoy it.

18:18.132 --> 18:19.365
Look, I checked around,

18:19.367 --> 18:21.400
and you need to watch out
for the baby arm.

18:21.402 --> 18:22.635
It's small and raptor-y,

18:22.637 --> 18:24.703
but there's some dense
cartilage in that bitch.

18:24.705 --> 18:28.647
You do not want to take
baby arm to the face.

18:28.648 --> 18:30.043
<i>Fight! Fight!</i>

18:30.044 --> 18:31.410
- Stop dancing and fight!
- Whatever, then.

18:31.412 --> 18:33.112
- Let's get it then, homey.
- You're right, Ted.

18:33.114 --> 18:36.248
This guy is the biggest
bitch-ass pussy I ever seen.

18:37.952 --> 18:41.078
Kick his ass, Ted!

18:43.491 --> 18:45.324
Tell your ugly-ass
brother to shut up.

18:45.326 --> 18:47.226
What did you say, you little punk?

18:47.228 --> 18:49.395
You don't want to make her angry.

18:49.397 --> 18:51.564
You won't like her
when she's angry.

18:51.566 --> 18:53.432
Man, come on.
He can't fight no girl.

18:53.434 --> 18:55.901
That's right. I can't.
You lucky I'm a man.

18:55.903 --> 18:57.937
I ain't fighting no big,
hairy-chested mountain bitch,

18:57.939 --> 19:00.005
even one as fugly as you.

19:01.008 --> 19:04.310
- The hell you doing?
- Self-preservation. It's a white thang.

19:04.312 --> 19:07.446
Don't you get it?
It's the reverse Ray Rice.

19:07.448 --> 19:09.782
Milk might take a beating,
but he won't hit a girl

19:09.784 --> 19:12.718
- and that'll make him a...
- Legend.

19:14.956 --> 19:17.289
<i>- What do you think of that now, huh?
- Argh!</i>

19:18.292 --> 19:21.393
- Like that? Smell it!
- Throw the damn towel!

19:21.395 --> 19:24.063
Come on, Milk. You got this.
Represent the Legends.

19:24.065 --> 19:25.564
You don't want to end up
on Worldstar.

19:25.566 --> 19:28.334
I can't fight her either.
I can't hit a bitch.

19:28.336 --> 19:30.002
Ha! I can.

19:33.040 --> 19:37.710
Damn! That's gonna make
his voice annoyingly high.

19:37.712 --> 19:39.612
What?

19:39.614 --> 19:41.680
What the hell y'all laughing at?

19:41.682 --> 19:42.982
<i> Uh, nothing?</i>

19:47.655 --> 19:50.898
<i> Not the baby arm!</i>

19:51.038 --> 19:54.038
So there you have it.
Cornel West and Spike Lee.

19:54.040 --> 19:56.841
The only way you'll feel blacker
is if you watch it on stolen cable.

19:56.843 --> 20:00.178
- What do you think?
- Aw, I'm in a school daze,

20:00.180 --> 20:02.046
but I feel like doing the right thing.

20:02.048 --> 20:04.048
And even though
she's gotta have it,

20:04.050 --> 20:06.284
I no longer have jungle fever.

20:06.286 --> 20:09.654
Okay, I might have overdone
it with the Spike Lee movies,

20:09.656 --> 20:11.222
but welcome to the struggle, brother.

20:11.224 --> 20:14.225
You are no longer a negro in my eyes.
You are a black man.

20:14.227 --> 20:16.227
Thanks for not giving
up on me, Malik.

20:16.229 --> 20:18.196
A'ight. I need to go
hold down the block.

20:18.198 --> 20:20.798
Brother, I'll never forget
the day we bonded.

20:20.800 --> 20:23.968
- My past will never be my future.
- Peace.

20:25.338 --> 20:28.673
But my present is a gift!
Gullible-ass nigga.

20:35.182 --> 20:38.950
You know, liquid nachos
ain't all that bad, my nigs.

20:38.952 --> 20:41.018
At least we earned
these seats this time.

20:42.422 --> 20:45.020
Yeah, that's a good one.
Hey, I got a few ideas

20:45.021 --> 20:47.738
- I wanna pitch y'all.
- Aw, hell, no!
