00:00.019 --> 00:01.051
<i>Previously on</i> Dynasty...

00:01.054 --> 00:03.619
That is no way to talk to your new boss.

00:03.621 --> 00:05.254
He offered me the COO position.

00:05.256 --> 00:07.457
<i>With Jeff's backing,
I will be chief executive officer</i>

00:07.459 --> 00:09.325
of Carrington Windbriar.

00:09.327 --> 00:10.793
Your new competition.

00:10.795 --> 00:12.695
Matthew coming by today,
was that some sort of test?

00:12.697 --> 00:14.530
<i>Someone spotted you two last night.</i>

00:14.532 --> 00:16.432
<i>There was a
malfunction with the thumper truck.</i>

00:16.434 --> 00:18.000
<i>What if the issue is murder?</i>

00:18.002 --> 00:19.735
You trying to honor the dead
or yourself, Blake?

00:19.737 --> 00:21.971
Wife, mistress...

00:21.973 --> 00:24.474
<i>Widow? Or will you leave
Claudia that scrap?</i>

00:24.476 --> 00:25.641
You have the right to remain silent.

00:25.643 --> 00:26.876
<i>He's accusing you of murder.</i>

00:26.878 --> 00:28.945
I had nothing to do
with Matthew's death.

00:28.947 --> 00:30.580
I can't go and tell
him that my entire past

00:30.582 --> 00:31.714
<i>is one big lie.</i>

00:31.716 --> 00:32.782
<i>Who would do this to you?</i>

00:32.784 --> 00:34.951
Hey!

00:34.953 --> 00:37.320
<i>- You're cool. I got the money.
- What'd you do?</i>

00:37.322 --> 00:38.955
Who do you think set up
tonight's little robbery?

00:38.957 --> 00:40.957
<i>It's missing.
If what's on that phone gets out,</i>

00:41.790 --> 00:43.793
it will ruin the Carrington name.

00:51.469 --> 00:52.735
Come on, let's go!

01:00.512 --> 01:01.777
Did you break a nail back there?
Let's go, Steven!

01:01.779 --> 01:03.012
Hyah! Hyah!

01:08.386 --> 01:10.101
You're off your game, Steven.

01:10.705 --> 01:12.688
Murder charge will do that to you.

01:12.690 --> 01:14.690
Well, this is supposed to cheer you up.

01:14.692 --> 01:16.859
The only thing my brother
should ever be accused of

01:16.861 --> 01:18.828
is his poor taste in men.

01:18.830 --> 01:20.863
Maybe you should screw
one of Dad's lawyers.

01:20.865 --> 01:23.533
Pretty sure they're screwing us
with their astronomical fees.

01:23.535 --> 01:25.902
Well, if they can get you off...

01:25.904 --> 01:27.770
Innuendo unintended.

01:27.772 --> 01:29.071
Without an airtight alibi

01:29.073 --> 01:30.439
to prove that I didn't kill Matthew,

01:30.441 --> 01:32.041
the FBI are saying we
need to provide them

01:32.043 --> 01:33.476
with a credible alternative suspect.

01:33.478 --> 01:34.577
I'm not just gonna let them

01:34.579 --> 01:35.845
throw someone else under the bus.

01:35.847 --> 01:37.547
Well, why not? Daddy would.

01:37.549 --> 01:39.582
As juvenile as it sounds,
I wish Mom were here.

01:39.584 --> 01:40.750
Why?

01:40.752 --> 01:42.185
The only thing she's good for

01:42.187 --> 01:44.387
is the occasional birthday
card that her secretary writes.

01:44.389 --> 01:46.122
She spelled your name wrong last time.

01:46.124 --> 01:48.057
Lots of people think it's "ph."

01:48.059 --> 01:49.926
I just wish I could ask her advice.

01:49.928 --> 01:52.295
Hey, the best thing Mom ever taught us

01:52.297 --> 01:54.530
is what we learned when she left:

01:54.532 --> 01:57.300
you can only rely on yourself.

01:57.302 --> 01:58.534
And me.

02:04.776 --> 02:07.310
Timing's a bit obvious, don't you think?

02:07.312 --> 02:11.180
Getting out of Dodge the day
after the house was robbed.

02:12.650 --> 02:15.418
Don't forget to pack the silver.

02:15.420 --> 02:18.221
Thanks for the bags, Anders.

02:20.625 --> 02:22.525
Where are you going?

02:22.527 --> 02:23.826
Away.

02:24.807 --> 02:26.429
Done with the Carringtons so soon?

02:26.431 --> 02:29.098
I'm just about done with you, Sam.

02:29.100 --> 02:30.666
I'm not exactly over the fact

02:30.668 --> 02:32.935
that you staged a robbery in my home.

02:32.937 --> 02:34.904
It'll be fine. My mom's got her money,

02:34.906 --> 02:37.173
and you can get a less tacky ring,

02:37.175 --> 02:39.742
something that doesn't
belong in a gumball machine.

02:39.744 --> 02:42.178
Right now,
Blake is meeting with Stansfield.

02:42.180 --> 02:44.447
If the cops find out
that it was your friends,

02:44.449 --> 02:47.116
that you were involved,
that I'm lying to my husband...

02:47.118 --> 02:48.651
Add it to the list.

02:48.653 --> 02:49.486
This is different.

02:49.521 --> 02:52.221
You pick and choose your
lies like you do your men.

02:52.223 --> 02:54.056
Okay, enough.

02:54.058 --> 02:56.292
All I've done is jump from
one crisis to the next.

02:56.294 --> 02:58.294
Matthew, a murder investigation,

02:58.296 --> 02:59.996
now my nephew's felony.

02:59.998 --> 03:01.731
It's no way to start a marriage.

03:01.733 --> 03:02.658
So you're running away?

03:02.701 --> 03:04.400
I'm going on my honeymoon.

03:04.402 --> 03:07.803
Wow. Why pack anything at all?

03:07.805 --> 03:09.438
Yeah, put that away.

03:09.440 --> 03:11.574
I don't need to see how
Blake's sausage is made.

03:12.510 --> 03:13.876
Fine. Go.

03:13.878 --> 03:16.245
And this whole thing will
blow over before you get back.

03:16.247 --> 03:18.281
For your sake, I hope so.

03:18.283 --> 03:21.550
And Anders is sniffing around,
so you need to lay low.

03:21.552 --> 03:23.786
I always do.

03:23.788 --> 03:26.122
If the diamond was registered,
we have some hope of tracing it.

03:26.124 --> 03:28.724
Forget about the ring.
That's what insurance is for.

03:28.726 --> 03:30.226
I need that phone back.

03:30.228 --> 03:33.562
If anybody finds out that I had it,
or what's on it,

03:33.564 --> 03:35.298
the FBI's gonna be all over me.

03:35.300 --> 03:37.233
At the moment,
they're busy investigating your son.

03:37.235 --> 03:38.768
Who thinks that I gave it back to you.

03:38.770 --> 03:39.480
You told him.

03:39.538 --> 03:42.138
Well, he knew something was going on.

03:42.140 --> 03:45.241
And if he finds out I lied...

03:45.243 --> 03:47.543
I'm not the only one with
something to lose here.

03:47.545 --> 03:49.178
If anybody else finds out

03:49.180 --> 03:50.880
that I had that phone, they're gonna ask

03:50.882 --> 03:52.048
where I got it from.

03:52.050 --> 03:54.016
If they find out that you
stole it from evidence...

03:54.018 --> 03:56.452
The entire robbery division is on this,

03:56.454 --> 03:58.020
working around the clock.

03:58.022 --> 03:59.422
I don't care what you have to do.

03:59.424 --> 04:01.324
You find the people that took that phone

04:01.326 --> 04:03.025
before they realize what they have.

04:03.027 --> 04:05.194
Not just for my sake or yours.

04:06.931 --> 04:08.631
My family's, too.

04:13.217 --> 04:14.503
Can I help you?

04:14.505 --> 04:16.471
Just looking for the bathroom.

04:16.474 --> 04:18.507
It's easy to get lost in this place.

04:18.509 --> 04:21.377
Not easy enough.

04:22.045 --> 04:22.745
<i>Sorry I'm late.</i>

04:22.747 --> 04:25.147
I thought I'd squeeze in
a little morning ride.

04:25.149 --> 04:26.814
Mm. Anyone I know?

04:27.518 --> 04:29.685
A handsome warm-blood
palomino named Butterscotch.

04:29.687 --> 04:32.755
He was a gift for my
16th birthday from Daddy.

04:32.757 --> 04:35.991
Speaking of, what happened to
the dirt you were looking for?

04:35.993 --> 04:37.660
Nothing from the driver?

04:37.662 --> 04:39.729
Don't worry about the lawsuit.

04:39.731 --> 04:41.197
Your dad's gonna drop it?

04:41.199 --> 04:43.399
No. We are.

04:43.401 --> 04:44.967
We don't need the Carrington name.

04:44.969 --> 04:46.969
This company represents
a new start for me.

04:46.971 --> 04:47.970
We need a new name.

04:47.972 --> 04:49.405
My name.

04:49.407 --> 04:51.407
So what? Like Fallon Co.?

04:51.812 --> 04:54.076
This isn't amateur hour.

04:55.493 --> 04:57.847
Morell Green Energy Corporation?

04:57.849 --> 04:59.115
My middle name.

04:59.117 --> 05:01.617
A reminder that I can
only count on myself.

05:01.619 --> 05:03.252
What about the guy backing you?

05:03.254 --> 05:04.687
As you said, you're backing me.

05:04.689 --> 05:06.989
I'm the one who needs to
prove my value in this market,

05:06.991 --> 05:08.491
and I know how.

05:08.493 --> 05:10.826
The city utility contract
is up for renewal this year.

05:10.828 --> 05:12.044
It's worth a billion at least.

05:12.097 --> 05:14.296
You want to poach the city of Atlanta?

05:14.298 --> 05:17.199
Hasn't C.A. had that contract for,
like, 60 years?

05:17.201 --> 05:18.634
Well, imagine the headline:

05:18.636 --> 05:20.870
"The home of Carrington Atlantic
powered by Morell Corp."

05:20.872 --> 05:22.037
That's ambitious.

05:22.039 --> 05:23.806
You don't hit a home
run without a big swing.

05:23.808 --> 05:25.241
This would put us on the map.

05:25.243 --> 05:26.942
It would show people that clean energy

05:26.944 --> 05:28.310
could scale up in a big way.

05:28.312 --> 05:30.079
And screw over your dad.

05:30.241 --> 05:31.714
It's a win-win.

05:31.716 --> 05:33.549
His new COO can pick up the pieces.

05:33.551 --> 05:36.285
So how exactly are we
gonna pull this off?

05:36.287 --> 05:38.053
Oh, not "we," me.

05:38.055 --> 05:39.989
Chris Pfeiffer runs
point on these things

05:39.991 --> 05:41.605
over at the city council,
and he and I go back

05:41.693 --> 05:43.292
to my C.A. days. He loves me.

05:43.294 --> 05:45.594
Enough to cross Blake Carrington?

05:45.596 --> 05:47.329
Oh, please.
He would leave his wife for me.

05:47.331 --> 05:48.664
And his side piece.

05:48.666 --> 05:50.199
Not that I'm offering. I'm just saying.

05:50.201 --> 05:52.601
It won't take much to get
him eating out of my hand.

05:55.726 --> 05:56.839
Hey, sweetheart.

05:56.841 --> 05:59.108
Anders said you wanted to see me.

05:59.110 --> 06:00.409
What's going on?

06:00.411 --> 06:03.512
With everything that happened,
we missed Bora Bora.

06:03.514 --> 06:05.481
So, plan B.

06:05.483 --> 06:07.216
I've taken care of the arrangements,

06:07.218 --> 06:08.851
packed you a suitcase.

06:08.853 --> 06:11.120
I'm even handling the transportation.

06:11.122 --> 06:12.755
Where are we going?

06:12.757 --> 06:13.956
It's a surprise.

06:13.958 --> 06:16.425
But I can give you a
preview of the itinerary.

06:17.670 --> 06:18.794
Oh.

06:20.765 --> 06:24.133
Just so much going on here.

06:24.135 --> 06:28.170
Steven's charges and now the robbery.

06:28.172 --> 06:30.306
It's just not the best time to go away.

06:30.308 --> 06:32.341
And after this weekend,
we go back to work.

06:32.343 --> 06:34.210
If we don't go away now,

06:34.212 --> 06:36.679
we will be celebrating
our first anniversary

06:36.681 --> 06:38.914
before we take our honeymoon.

06:38.916 --> 06:40.816
I don't know.

06:40.818 --> 06:41.917
You're not Steven's lawyer.

06:41.919 --> 06:43.385
You've told Stansfield
everything you can

06:43.387 --> 06:46.088
about the robbery,
and we'll only be a phone call away.

06:47.823 --> 06:49.492
You make a very firm point.

06:49.494 --> 06:51.360
Mm-hmm.

06:51.362 --> 06:52.895
So when you robbed the place,

06:52.897 --> 06:54.730
did you find some kind of cell phone?

06:55.838 --> 06:57.800
You know, I was wondering
when you'd come for it.

06:57.802 --> 06:59.001
- So you have it.
- Yeah.

06:59.003 --> 07:00.836
It was in one of the
drawers in the bedroom.

07:00.838 --> 07:02.338
I was just grabbing things.

07:02.340 --> 07:04.473
Figured we'd look through
it when it was time to sell.

07:04.475 --> 07:06.141
Wait. You didn't sell it, did you?

07:06.143 --> 07:07.910
Not yet.

07:08.495 --> 07:10.479
Relax, man. I'm gonna cut you in.

07:11.023 --> 07:13.413
No, man, I don't need a cut.
I need the phone.

07:13.418 --> 07:15.518
They're looking for it and for you,

07:15.520 --> 07:18.020
and I think they'll stop
if they have it back.

07:18.022 --> 07:19.221
I'll give you cash.

07:19.223 --> 07:21.023
Can't be worth more
than a couple hundred.

07:21.025 --> 07:23.392
You mean a couple hundred grand, right?

07:23.394 --> 07:24.693
I saw the video, man.

07:24.695 --> 07:25.928
And since it is your aunt,

07:25.930 --> 07:27.796
I'll even give you a little bit extra.

07:27.798 --> 07:29.665
What video?

07:30.735 --> 07:32.935
The one with your aunt and the dead guy.

07:33.405 --> 07:36.305
Let's just say I didn't realize
they knew each other that well.

07:36.307 --> 07:37.706
Or that she was so hot.

07:38.808 --> 07:40.809
A sex tape?

07:40.811 --> 07:42.278
You can't sell that.

07:42.280 --> 07:43.679
Are you kidding me?

07:43.681 --> 07:45.681
That's Kardashian-level
filmmaking right there.

07:45.683 --> 07:47.466
We're gonna have a bidding war for it.

07:48.006 --> 07:51.387
Unless the Carringtons want
to pay fair market value.

07:51.389 --> 07:53.889
I just got you a huge payday.
Now you're getting greedy.

07:53.891 --> 07:55.291
I mean, that's easy to say
when you're living

07:55.293 --> 07:56.859
in their mansion, isn't it?

07:57.966 --> 07:58.894
Give me the phone.

07:58.896 --> 08:00.596
Get my money by 5:00.

08:02.000 --> 08:08.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:21.845 --> 08:23.375
There you are.

08:23.472 --> 08:25.123
Been trying Cristal,
but she's not picking up.

08:25.212 --> 08:26.489
Whoa, slow down. What happened?

08:26.580 --> 08:29.747
Remember when I told you I
have some sketchy friends?

08:29.749 --> 08:32.015
Stupid kid stuff, I think you said.

08:32.018 --> 08:34.618
Yeah. Well, it was one
of those stupid kids

08:34.620 --> 08:36.620
who bling-ringed your
house the other night.

08:36.621 --> 08:39.690
- What? Did you know?
- No.

08:39.692 --> 08:41.158
I mean, I told him about the gala,

08:41.159 --> 08:43.260
but I thought he was just
coming for the free food.

08:43.261 --> 08:44.795
Huh. And the free jewelry.

08:44.797 --> 08:46.197
Sounds like a great friend.

08:46.199 --> 08:47.565
I'll call Stansfield.

08:47.567 --> 08:49.333
No, no. Listen.

08:49.335 --> 08:50.835
It wasn't just jewelry.

08:50.837 --> 08:53.004
There was a phone in your dad's room...

08:53.006 --> 08:54.071
Matthew's phone,

08:54.073 --> 08:56.774
with a video of him and my aunt.

08:56.776 --> 08:58.776
He told me he gave that phone back.

08:58.778 --> 09:01.178
We need to come up with
$200,000 in the next few hours,

09:01.180 --> 09:02.613
or my aunt's sex tape

09:02.615 --> 09:04.094
will be all over the Internet.

09:04.150 --> 09:06.050
Cristal didn't do anything,
and she's the one

09:06.052 --> 09:07.518
who's gonna get hurt here.

09:09.355 --> 09:11.455
You have reached the cell phone

09:11.457 --> 09:12.790
of Blake Carrington. Press one...

09:12.792 --> 09:14.625
I don't even know where my dad is.

09:14.627 --> 09:18.362
Well... what would he do?

09:22.439 --> 09:23.768
The hunting cabin.

09:25.104 --> 09:28.105
Can't believe you chose this place.

09:29.308 --> 09:31.609
Of all the Carrington properties,

09:31.611 --> 09:33.911
this seemed the most low-key.

09:33.913 --> 09:35.779
I'm surprised you didn't
figure it out sooner.

09:35.781 --> 09:38.149
Oh, I've always come in by helicopter.

09:38.151 --> 09:39.583
Well, just so you know,

09:39.585 --> 09:41.886
we won't be killing any
animals on this trip.

09:41.888 --> 09:44.755
But I thought it would be
nice to get out of the city.

09:44.757 --> 09:48.259
Just you and me and these trees.

09:48.261 --> 09:50.361
Yeah, not one of them a cell tower.

09:50.363 --> 09:52.930
If you're good,
I might let you get on the Wi-Fi.

09:53.571 --> 09:54.832
There is no Wi-Fi.

09:54.834 --> 09:57.234
My grandfather built this
place to get away from it all.

09:57.236 --> 09:58.836
We never put in Internet.

09:58.838 --> 10:01.405
Even better! More time for us.

10:01.407 --> 10:03.007
Mm.

10:10.450 --> 10:12.616
No wonder people choose
the private sector.

10:12.618 --> 10:13.620
Fallon?

10:14.487 --> 10:16.220
Thank God. There's no receptionist.

10:16.222 --> 10:18.089
Kori Rucks.
I work with Councilman Pfeiffer.

10:18.091 --> 10:19.990
You wouldn't happen to have a
real cup of coffee, would you?

10:22.244 --> 10:24.228
Oh. That's a little too real.

10:25.204 --> 10:26.931
I'm sorry, I don't work for Chris.

10:26.933 --> 10:28.716
I'm on the council... district ten.

10:28.751 --> 10:29.466
I'm told that you're here

10:29.468 --> 10:31.635
- to discuss the utility contracts.
- Yes.

10:31.637 --> 10:33.838
I know that Councilman Pfeiffer
is in charge of all that, so...

10:33.840 --> 10:35.306
Actually, I'm taking over.

10:35.308 --> 10:38.642
So, if you're here to talk energy,
let's talk.

10:49.088 --> 10:50.821
Anders.

10:50.823 --> 10:52.823
Join me for a time trial.

10:52.825 --> 10:54.191
That would require sweat.

10:55.109 --> 10:55.826
Come on, man.

10:55.828 --> 10:57.795
You know Blake is out
of town for the weekend.

10:57.797 --> 11:00.364
You could lose a button or two.
Live a little.

11:03.069 --> 11:05.202
As you know, Mr. Carrington's very upset

11:05.204 --> 11:06.804
- about this robbery.
- Yeah.

11:06.806 --> 11:08.923
I could imagine. That was
a pretty nasty bump on his head.

11:09.008 --> 11:11.542
Finding out who's responsible
is a high priority for him,

11:11.544 --> 11:12.643
as it is for me.

11:12.645 --> 11:15.112
So, if you saw anything,

11:15.114 --> 11:17.448
anything that you thought
might be a bit amiss...

11:17.450 --> 11:19.683
Well, like I told the cops,
I wasn't really watching.

11:19.685 --> 11:22.419
I imagine you had your
head in other matters.

11:22.421 --> 11:24.622
Like Ms. Carrington.

11:25.600 --> 11:28.492
I take it she didn't see much, either.

11:28.494 --> 11:30.594
You'll have to ask Ms. Carrington.

11:30.596 --> 11:33.097
Very well.

11:33.099 --> 11:37.134
But if you should think of
something or hear anything,

11:37.136 --> 11:39.503
let me know.

11:39.505 --> 11:41.305
I don't have to remind you

11:41.307 --> 11:42.840
that this incident doesn't reflect well

11:42.842 --> 11:44.542
on those of us who are employed here.

11:44.544 --> 11:45.629
What does that mean?

11:45.812 --> 11:49.213
It's just that we all have a
stake in putting this to bed,

11:49.215 --> 11:51.749
especially those of us
with families that depend

11:51.751 --> 11:53.484
on our salaries.

11:55.930 --> 11:58.055
Anything specific I should
be listening out for?

11:58.057 --> 11:59.423
Just the personal effects.

11:59.425 --> 12:02.993
Mrs. Carrington's ring,
some watches, and a phone

12:02.995 --> 12:06.430
of particular value to Mr. Carrington.

12:06.432 --> 12:08.465
All right.
I'll keep my ear to the ground.

12:09.795 --> 12:11.902
And your mouth off Fallon.

12:15.208 --> 12:17.541
Morell Corp represents the
next generation of energy,

12:17.543 --> 12:19.977
and Atlanta has a chance
to become a national model

12:19.979 --> 12:21.078
for a green city.

12:21.080 --> 12:22.379
We plan to take clean power

12:22.381 --> 12:24.081
and spread it up and down the coast,

12:24.083 --> 12:25.316
take it national and then beyond.

12:25.318 --> 12:27.451
So Atlanta's just the first step.

12:27.453 --> 12:28.319
Exactly.

12:28.321 --> 12:29.887
Hmm.

12:31.224 --> 12:34.058
I wish you the best of
luck with your new company,

12:34.060 --> 12:36.493
but Atlanta is not a means to an end.

12:36.495 --> 12:39.863
This is my home, my city,
and now my responsibility,

12:39.865 --> 12:42.633
not some pawn in the
Carrington family feud.

12:42.635 --> 12:44.134
Well, I understand the connotations

12:44.136 --> 12:45.603
with the Carrington name,
but Morell Corp.

12:45.605 --> 12:47.071
is an entirely different company.

12:47.073 --> 12:49.773
Well, whatever you call it,
you're still you,

12:49.775 --> 12:52.276
and you haven't changed
since high school.

12:54.109 --> 12:55.512
You went to Penley.

12:55.514 --> 12:56.865
Oh, my God.

12:57.149 --> 12:58.716
Of course. Kori.

12:58.718 --> 13:01.185
You look so different.
Did you change your hair?

13:01.187 --> 13:02.353
Come on, Fallon.

13:03.153 --> 13:04.088
You can't expect me

13:04.090 --> 13:07.358
to buy this "new year,
new me" bit, can you?

13:08.967 --> 13:10.094
Maybe you can.

13:10.096 --> 13:13.163
You seem to have the whole
world bowing at your feet.

13:13.835 --> 13:16.700
I'm sure you'll be fine without Atlanta.

13:18.297 --> 13:21.272
See you at the ten-year reunion.

13:23.662 --> 13:25.709
I didn't know who else to call.

13:25.711 --> 13:27.011
You did the right thing.

13:27.013 --> 13:29.246
This guy is a friend of Sam's.

13:29.248 --> 13:31.815
I don't know if you can
call that a friend, but...

13:32.770 --> 13:35.052
he used Sam to get into the house.

13:35.054 --> 13:37.655
And he has the phone
with this video on it?

13:37.657 --> 13:39.957
He's trying to extort my father,
but Dad is M.I.A.,

13:39.959 --> 13:41.292
and we don't have that much time.

13:41.294 --> 13:42.426
How much does this guy want?

13:42.428 --> 13:43.761
$200,000. That's easy.

13:43.763 --> 13:46.664
But what if I get the
phone back and he's already

13:46.666 --> 13:48.232
- copied the video?
- Right.

13:48.234 --> 13:51.769
Why settle for one payday
if you can have two?

13:51.771 --> 13:53.270
And, uh, the nephew?

13:54.286 --> 13:56.140
No, Sam didn't have
anything to do with this.

13:56.142 --> 13:59.043
He's tied up with some bad people.

13:59.045 --> 14:01.312
The best shot at stopping this

14:01.314 --> 14:03.180
is putting cuffs on both of them.

14:03.182 --> 14:05.582
Arresting Blake Carrington's new nephew

14:05.584 --> 14:08.052
would only invite questions.

14:08.054 --> 14:12.256
Questions you don't want,
since you stole the phone first.

14:12.258 --> 14:14.125
From evidence.

14:14.127 --> 14:16.293
Look, I just want all this to be over.

14:16.295 --> 14:19.063
So I'll go in and buy the phone,
you come in and get this guy.

14:19.826 --> 14:22.466
Silver spoon's first sting.

14:22.468 --> 14:24.601
Your dad would be proud.

14:26.172 --> 14:28.539
Let's just call this what it is.

14:28.541 --> 14:32.209
This is you cleaning
up your own corruption.

14:32.211 --> 14:33.610
You tampered with a murder investigation

14:33.612 --> 14:35.879
when you should have been
actually figuring out who did it

14:35.881 --> 14:37.715
so that I don't go to prison
for a crime I didn't commit.

14:37.717 --> 14:39.416
What exactly do you want me to do?

14:39.418 --> 14:40.417
Do your job.

14:40.419 --> 14:42.453
Find out who really killed Matthew.

14:42.455 --> 14:43.754
Make it right.

14:50.685 --> 14:52.754
How could you not remember Kori?

14:52.756 --> 14:54.389
Well, I do now.

14:54.391 --> 14:56.992
Didn't she have some weird
Hello Kitty obsession?

14:56.994 --> 14:58.794
You still don't.

14:58.796 --> 15:00.862
Maybe I should have been
your wingman, after all.

15:00.864 --> 15:02.097
I'm glad you find this funny,

15:02.099 --> 15:03.732
but I am not losing this contract, Jeff,

15:03.734 --> 15:05.433
especially not over a few hurt feelings.

15:05.435 --> 15:07.536
You really think it's
just about high school?

15:07.538 --> 15:08.870
Obviously.

15:08.872 --> 15:10.018
Why don't you let me try?

15:10.363 --> 15:12.541
Maybe I can smooth things over.

15:12.543 --> 15:14.676
Remind Kori that you're
not the whole company.

15:14.678 --> 15:15.844
Kori Rucks?

15:15.846 --> 15:17.546
Seriously?

15:17.548 --> 15:18.404
You, too?

15:18.483 --> 15:20.549
Fallon had a meeting with her today.

15:20.551 --> 15:21.626
Didn't know who she was.

15:21.985 --> 15:24.319
I might have also asked her
to get me a cup of coffee.

15:24.321 --> 15:25.139
- What?
- What?

15:25.189 --> 15:26.721
I know. I thought she was an assistant.

15:26.723 --> 15:28.623
- I'm fixing it.
- No, actually, I am.

15:28.625 --> 15:30.425
I'm gonna call her.

15:30.427 --> 15:31.560
Good luck with that.

15:31.562 --> 15:33.862
You know Kori does not roll over easily.

15:33.864 --> 15:34.996
Present tense?

15:34.998 --> 15:36.198
- You're still friends?
- Yeah.

15:36.200 --> 15:38.600
We went to MJQ last weekend.
I invited you.

15:39.402 --> 15:41.436
Do you listen to anything I say?

15:41.438 --> 15:42.871
Don't take it personally.

15:42.873 --> 15:45.574
Actually, Monica,
what if you invited her out tonight,

15:45.576 --> 15:47.309
and I just happened to be there?

15:47.311 --> 15:48.602
She might be a bit more receptive.

15:48.689 --> 15:51.847
Well, with all due respect,
I'm the one who knows energy.

15:51.849 --> 15:53.782
Yeah, let me butter her up, okay?

15:53.784 --> 15:55.826
Set the stage, then you come in.

15:55.886 --> 15:57.586
And do all the heavy lifting.

15:57.588 --> 15:59.221
Not that your part isn't heavy, too.

16:00.972 --> 16:01.990
I got to say,

16:02.448 --> 16:05.460
I do not mind not having an office yet.

16:05.462 --> 16:08.263
We swimming or what?

16:13.507 --> 16:15.274
Looks like the Carringtons came through.

16:15.276 --> 16:17.443
$200,000. It's all here.

16:17.445 --> 16:19.912
Where's the phone?

16:22.350 --> 16:23.749
How do I know that's it?

16:23.751 --> 16:25.284
Show me the contacts or something.

16:28.589 --> 16:30.222
Okay, turn it off.

16:33.010 --> 16:34.426
You swear this is the only copy?

16:35.289 --> 16:36.776
Even I have a code, okay?

16:36.811 --> 16:37.563
Deal's a deal.

16:38.241 --> 16:39.431
Don't spend it all in one place.

16:39.433 --> 16:40.799
Back at you.

16:40.801 --> 16:42.768
I'm sure Carrington's
errand boy pays pretty well.

16:43.602 --> 16:45.204
You're the one with 200 grand now.

16:45.834 --> 16:47.439
I'm Robin Hood.

16:48.432 --> 16:49.274
Everything okay?

16:49.686 --> 16:51.419
Got it.

16:51.421 --> 16:52.721
And the video?

16:52.723 --> 16:55.223
- He swears it's the only copy.
- Do you believe him?

16:55.225 --> 16:58.260
Look, screwed up as it sounds,
he's not a bad dude.

16:59.314 --> 17:01.062
Why are you freaking out?

17:01.064 --> 17:03.098
I got it. We're good.

17:04.486 --> 17:05.534
Yeah, you can go in.

17:06.770 --> 17:09.538
Yeah, I'll get you the phone
after you get my 200 grand back.

17:10.027 --> 17:11.297
Who was that?

17:11.332 --> 17:12.307
Stansfield.

17:12.309 --> 17:13.775
What?

17:15.479 --> 17:17.078
- You didn't say anything about cops.
- Don't worry.

17:17.079 --> 17:19.146
<i>I told him you didn't
have anything to do with that.</i>

17:19.148 --> 17:21.583
Hey, if anything,
you were the one that solved it.

17:22.355 --> 17:25.020
Let's get out of here.

17:26.009 --> 17:27.888
Go, go, go!

17:27.891 --> 17:31.326
So, I know I said no dead animals,

17:31.328 --> 17:35.163
but since this one's already here,

17:35.165 --> 17:38.200
I thought I'd slip into something

17:38.202 --> 17:41.436
a little more comfortable.

17:43.273 --> 17:46.141
Blake?

17:49.156 --> 17:50.612
Damn it!

17:50.614 --> 17:52.013
What are you doing?

17:52.015 --> 17:53.181
I missed a call from the office.

17:53.183 --> 17:56.318
My damn phone won't even ring out here.

17:56.320 --> 17:58.611
Can't even call them back.
I can't even get voice mail.

17:58.622 --> 18:01.389
So, I'm standing here naked,
wrapped in an animal

18:01.391 --> 18:03.458
that probably died before I was born,

18:03.460 --> 18:04.893
and you're calling the office?

18:04.895 --> 18:06.582
Well, if you'd have told me
we were gonna be off the grid,

18:06.597 --> 18:07.829
I would have planned things differently.

18:07.831 --> 18:10.066
I thought the surprise
would be romantic.

18:10.354 --> 18:13.307
These are the first few days we've
had just to be husband and wife,

18:13.370 --> 18:16.104
and they might be the last
ones we have for a while.

18:16.106 --> 18:18.506
Just want to enjoy them.

18:18.508 --> 18:20.475
Don't you?

18:20.477 --> 18:22.677
- Of course, I do.
- Good.

18:22.679 --> 18:25.380
If I remember correctly,
there's a waterfall

18:25.677 --> 18:27.582
a couple of miles from here.

18:27.584 --> 18:30.352
It's not a hot tub,
but you can't beat it for stargazing.

18:30.354 --> 18:32.153
So, if you're up for an adventure...

18:32.155 --> 18:35.590
- Always. I'll go change.
- Hang on.

18:35.592 --> 18:37.726
One minute.

18:40.530 --> 18:42.831
Well, can we try for two?

18:44.016 --> 18:44.799
<i>Why didn't you tell me</i>

18:44.801 --> 18:46.034
you had gone to Stansfield?

18:46.036 --> 18:47.669
What kind of a friend
robs your aunt's house,

18:47.671 --> 18:49.337
then tries to blackmail
her with a sex tape?

18:49.339 --> 18:51.039
I'm not saying that
what he did was okay.

18:51.041 --> 18:52.874
No, it was technically illegal.

18:52.876 --> 18:53.975
Have you ever broken a law?

18:55.114 --> 18:56.611
I've never extorted anyone.

18:56.613 --> 18:58.213
Because you haven't had to.

18:58.215 --> 19:01.650
You don't know what it is like
to worry about making rent

19:01.652 --> 19:04.085
or what you're gonna do
if your car breaks down.

19:04.087 --> 19:06.488
Are you seriously suggesting
we should've just let him

19:06.490 --> 19:07.656
get away with it?

19:07.658 --> 19:08.857
Taken him at his word

19:08.859 --> 19:10.056
that he's gonna stick to the deal?

19:10.127 --> 19:12.460
- He's a-a criminal.
- Why didn't you tell me your plan?

19:12.462 --> 19:14.195
Look, I didn't want
to make you lie in there.

19:14.197 --> 19:15.730
I was trying to protect you.

19:15.732 --> 19:16.965
And who does that sound like?

19:18.274 --> 19:19.768
I thought you were the different one,

19:19.770 --> 19:21.903
but now I see the family resemblance.

19:21.905 --> 19:23.171
Mr. Carrington.

19:25.332 --> 19:27.809
- You got two seconds for me?
- I'm already late.

19:27.811 --> 19:29.778
Wait, what does this dress say to you?

19:29.780 --> 19:31.212
Bold? Demure?

19:31.214 --> 19:32.614
Loud enough to command a room

19:32.616 --> 19:34.549
yet still whisper
"top of the class at Wharton"?

19:36.904 --> 19:37.619
Is that...?

19:37.621 --> 19:38.586
Matthew's phone.

19:38.588 --> 19:39.888
- What,<i> you</i> took it?
- No.

19:39.890 --> 19:41.589
Sam's friend did when
he robbed our house.

19:41.591 --> 19:42.857
It's a long story.

19:42.859 --> 19:44.826
But Dad told me he'd given
this back to Stansfield.

19:44.828 --> 19:46.962
- Hmm. So, how'd you get it back?
- Sam.

19:46.964 --> 19:48.763
And 200 grand.

19:48.765 --> 19:51.366
But you remember the photo of
Cristal and Matthew in the car?

19:51.716 --> 19:52.467
Yeah.

19:52.469 --> 19:56.037
Well, there's a video on here of
them doing way more than sitting.

19:56.873 --> 19:58.006
Have you seen it?

19:58.008 --> 19:59.407
I can't unsee it.

19:59.409 --> 20:01.710
I don't even want to
know why Dad had it.

20:03.615 --> 20:05.688
Oh. Well, at least it's grainy.

20:05.723 --> 20:07.917
Though she almost looks hot upside down.

20:08.518 --> 20:10.018
Well, I got the phone back,

20:10.020 --> 20:12.020
and I led Stansfield to the robber.

20:12.763 --> 20:14.356
Wait. You helped Stansfield?

20:14.358 --> 20:17.659
I helped everyone...
Dad, Cristal, Sammy Jo.

20:17.661 --> 20:19.327
- Well, what do you get?
- What do you mean?

20:19.329 --> 20:21.930
Well, you're on the hook for
a murder you didn't commit.

20:21.932 --> 20:24.099
You should negotiate.
You give Stansfield the phone,

20:24.101 --> 20:25.633
and he gives you the alternate suspect

20:25.635 --> 20:26.837
the lawyers think you need.

20:26.870 --> 20:28.903
I mean, as long as you're
complicit in police corruption,

20:28.905 --> 20:30.538
- you might as well work it.
- I can't do that.

20:30.540 --> 20:33.274
So if you simply hand over
the phone to Stansfield,

20:33.276 --> 20:35.543
- where does that leave you?
- Back to square one.

20:35.545 --> 20:37.212
No closer to figuring
out who killed Matthew,

20:37.214 --> 20:38.813
and the FBI still thinks I did it.

20:38.815 --> 20:41.182
Yeah, especially if you're the
last one holding onto this.

20:41.184 --> 20:44.686
It is a spectacularly bad time
for Dad to be out of town.

20:44.688 --> 20:46.588
What did I just tell you this morning?

20:46.590 --> 20:48.356
We don't need anybody but us.

20:48.358 --> 20:49.691
Use what you've got, Steven.

20:49.693 --> 20:51.326
The sooner this is all over,

20:51.328 --> 20:53.161
the sooner you can get
back to saving the world,

20:53.163 --> 20:55.497
and I can get back to taking it over.

21:04.870 --> 21:07.061
- Be good in there.
- I'll try.

21:07.386 --> 21:08.291
Hey, why don't you come with?

21:08.879 --> 21:11.395
I need somebody to keep me company
before I meet up with Jeff.

21:11.397 --> 21:13.096
Ah, I didn't really dress for the club.

21:13.098 --> 21:14.564
You're with me.

21:14.566 --> 21:16.199
No one'll be looking at you.

21:28.580 --> 21:30.747
- Do you see Jeff?
- VIP's over there.

21:33.936 --> 21:35.052
I don't want Kori to see me yet.

21:35.054 --> 21:36.253
Not until Jeff fluffs her,

21:36.255 --> 21:38.344
gets her feeling a
little bit more generous.

21:38.379 --> 21:40.824
- Let's get a drink at the bar.
- Okay.

21:42.958 --> 21:43.659
Ugh!

21:43.708 --> 21:46.396
How do people live like this...
waiting in line?

21:46.398 --> 21:48.198
Uh, your Carrington's showing.

21:48.200 --> 21:49.566
Southside?

21:49.568 --> 21:52.035
No. Club soda. I'm working.

21:56.542 --> 21:59.509
Fallon Carrington. Hi.

21:59.511 --> 22:02.199
Robby. What a surprise.

22:02.234 --> 22:04.324
Yeah. Kori Rucks texted me
and told me to come out.

22:04.359 --> 22:05.536
You remember Kori, right?

22:05.571 --> 22:06.807
I didn't know you'd be here tonight.

22:07.319 --> 22:08.218
It's been a while, hasn't it?

22:08.220 --> 22:09.719
Like, seven and a half months, yeah.

22:09.721 --> 22:11.188
- Oh, wow. We're keeping track.
- You know, I've been

22:11.190 --> 22:12.823
texting you,
and I know you've been getting them.

22:12.825 --> 22:15.417
- About St. Barths?
- I thought that already happened.

22:15.452 --> 22:16.927
It did, but I can always go back.

22:16.929 --> 22:19.396
- What's your schedule like?
- Um...

22:19.398 --> 22:22.232
Robby, this is my boyfriend, Michael.

22:22.234 --> 22:24.835
Robby and I went to school together.

22:25.807 --> 22:26.970
It's like a reunion up in here.

22:26.972 --> 22:29.071
Did you go to, uh, Penley, too?

22:29.106 --> 22:30.211
Decatur.

22:30.246 --> 22:31.174
Public.

22:31.176 --> 22:32.409
Wow.

22:33.345 --> 22:34.611
Uh, good for you, man.

22:34.613 --> 22:36.279
And, uh, good to see you, Fallon.

22:36.281 --> 22:37.881
You, too.

22:42.164 --> 22:42.953
Boyfriend?

22:43.839 --> 22:45.322
Let's dance.

23:23.633 --> 23:24.794
I am blowing up.

23:26.865 --> 23:29.399
"Cristal Carrington Sex Tape"?
Is that real?

23:29.401 --> 23:30.734
Oh, it's real.

23:31.670 --> 23:32.769
How do you know?

23:32.771 --> 23:35.172
Educated guess. Excuse me.

23:35.174 --> 23:37.841
I have to make some calls.

23:37.843 --> 23:39.509
Glad this is behind us.

23:40.243 --> 23:42.512
Now, it's best that doesn't make it back

23:42.514 --> 23:43.713
to police headquarters.

23:43.715 --> 23:47.284
Shouldn't make it back
to my father, either.

23:47.286 --> 23:49.619
This is between us.

23:52.791 --> 23:55.325
What are you doing?

23:55.327 --> 23:58.428
You have your money back,
your friend is safe...

23:58.430 --> 23:59.696
But I'm not.

23:59.698 --> 24:03.099
I want to make sure there's
no misunderstanding here.

24:03.101 --> 24:05.702
By giving you this,
I'm giving you a second chance.

24:05.704 --> 24:07.704
It's an opportunity
to make things right.

24:07.706 --> 24:09.105
Not just for me.

24:09.107 --> 24:12.008
The Blaisdel family deserves closure.

24:12.010 --> 24:14.077
Matthew deserves justice.

24:14.079 --> 24:16.246
That's your responsibility now.

24:20.331 --> 24:23.420
You want me to find the real killer,
but I already told you,

24:23.422 --> 24:25.322
it's the FBI's case now.

24:25.324 --> 24:27.591
And I'm telling you, I don't care.

24:28.622 --> 24:29.759
Do your job.

24:30.702 --> 24:31.962
Close the case.

24:33.832 --> 24:35.165
Understood.

24:37.536 --> 24:38.902
Have you seen this?

24:38.904 --> 24:40.403
Oh, more than seen it.

24:40.405 --> 24:42.339
Honestly,
I did not expect the landing strip.

24:42.341 --> 24:43.473
Okay, don't be a perv.

24:43.475 --> 24:45.675
Speaking of pervs,
did you see Robby Reid?

24:45.677 --> 24:48.678
On his way out.
He said he met your boyfriend.

24:49.484 --> 24:50.747
And here I was thinking
that you're not dating

24:50.749 --> 24:52.115
because you're a workaholic,

24:52.117 --> 24:54.251
but you're just multitasking
by screwing your driver.

24:54.253 --> 24:57.053
God, no. I just told him
that so he'd get off my back.

24:57.055 --> 24:58.364
What? It worked.

25:00.002 --> 25:01.358
I'm sorry. It just won't stop.

25:01.360 --> 25:03.226
And what about Kori and Jeff?

25:03.228 --> 25:05.762
Aren't you supposed to swoop
in there and close that deal?

25:05.764 --> 25:07.664
I know. I know. I'll be right back.

25:13.662 --> 25:15.572
I know Fallon has her blind spots.

25:15.574 --> 25:16.740
I hadn't noticed.

25:16.742 --> 25:18.275
But I'm telling you,

25:18.277 --> 25:20.644
if there's one thing she does know,
it's energy.

25:20.646 --> 25:22.112
It's in her blood.

25:22.114 --> 25:24.024
Of course. She's a Carrington.

25:24.059 --> 25:25.815
But that's the problem.

25:25.817 --> 25:29.452
The city of Atlanta is not gonna
be a pawn in their family feud.

25:30.185 --> 25:31.580
This contract will determine

25:31.615 --> 25:32.689
whether people can keep their lights on,

25:32.691 --> 25:35.125
and I don't trust Fallon Carrington

25:35.127 --> 25:37.093
to think of them when it counts.

25:37.996 --> 25:39.229
Do you trust me?

25:39.231 --> 25:40.430
You went into business with her.

25:40.432 --> 25:42.299
That means it's my business, too.

25:42.301 --> 25:45.835
You know I'll do right
by you and by this city.

25:45.837 --> 25:48.471
If you'll at least hear her out,

25:48.473 --> 25:51.539
I promise I'll hold her to her word.

25:51.574 --> 25:53.610
I will, for you.

25:56.862 --> 26:00.517
You know, I think my sister
invited her out tonight.

26:02.599 --> 26:03.620
I'll get us another bottle.

26:07.092 --> 26:09.426
Yo. Where's Fallon?
And why are you drinking?

26:10.410 --> 26:12.362
I thought you were her ride.

26:12.364 --> 26:14.864
- Not anymore.
- Just tell your girlfriend I'm looking for her, okay?

26:14.866 --> 26:17.801
- She's not my girlfriend.
- Sure looked like she was the other night at the gala.

26:19.107 --> 26:21.340
Talk to Fallon, okay?

26:21.342 --> 26:23.543
I've never gotten a
straight answer out of her.

26:23.545 --> 26:25.711
Maybe you will.

26:26.981 --> 26:28.347
Hey, wait up.

26:32.992 --> 26:34.620
Why don't you join us for a drink?

26:35.924 --> 26:38.090
Okay.

26:39.794 --> 26:42.895
Kori, this is Michael Culhane.

26:42.897 --> 26:45.331
He's a... friend.

26:45.333 --> 26:47.600
Mm.

26:49.537 --> 26:51.704
A single friend?

26:53.875 --> 26:56.008
I believe he is.

26:58.744 --> 27:00.477
Can you just admit that we're lost?

27:00.479 --> 27:03.146
Well, I will admit that I should've
paid for street lamps out here,

27:03.148 --> 27:04.414
'cause I can't see a damn thing.

27:04.416 --> 27:05.815
Maybe I should look at the map.

27:08.954 --> 27:11.454
Good luck.

27:12.079 --> 27:13.957
So, the sun set that way,

27:13.959 --> 27:16.226
which means...

27:16.228 --> 27:18.895
we've been going north this whole time.

27:18.897 --> 27:21.931
Blake, I told you we were
going in the wrong direction.

27:21.933 --> 27:24.000
Look, we're probably
all the way over here now.

27:24.362 --> 27:25.461
By this ranger station.

27:25.463 --> 27:27.197
Well, maybe they can help us.

27:27.232 --> 27:28.798
I'd be willing to ask directions.

27:30.385 --> 27:32.168
Do you seriously expect me to believe

27:32.170 --> 27:34.003
that you accidentally led us

27:34.005 --> 27:35.672
straight to the ranger station?

27:35.674 --> 27:38.775
Are you actually that desperate
to check your messages?

27:38.777 --> 27:41.110
I told you it wasn't a good time,
but you insisted.

27:41.112 --> 27:42.445
So you admit it.

27:42.447 --> 27:44.747
You did bring us here on purpose.

27:44.749 --> 27:46.482
God!

27:46.484 --> 27:48.618
I can't believe I thought we could have

27:48.620 --> 27:51.354
one whole day together
without the world pressing in.

27:53.291 --> 27:55.992
Oh. And there it is.

27:57.162 --> 27:59.095
Well, you came all this way for service.

27:59.097 --> 28:00.530
You might as well have a look.

28:06.304 --> 28:08.571
Oh, hell.

28:11.076 --> 28:12.608
Oh, my God.

28:12.610 --> 28:15.278
Did they find the robber?

28:15.280 --> 28:17.447
Oh, my God.

28:17.449 --> 28:18.881
What is this?

28:18.883 --> 28:21.951
Looks like it's you and Matthew.

28:21.953 --> 28:24.153
- All over the Internet.
- _

28:29.861 --> 28:32.228
Are you... filming me?

28:43.408 --> 28:45.641
Stop. Let me film you.

28:59.747 --> 29:01.681
I want my lawyers here, now.

29:01.683 --> 29:04.150
Waiting in the study, sir.

29:04.152 --> 29:06.486
Perhaps we suggest they move in.

29:15.556 --> 29:17.089
I'm sorry, what?!

29:17.091 --> 29:18.462
Your "friend" did that to me?

29:18.559 --> 29:20.798
- Ow.
- How could you let this happen, Sam?

29:21.633 --> 29:24.093
I don't know.
I guess he had a fail-safe.

29:24.136 --> 29:27.036
Or he lied and he had already sold it.

29:27.534 --> 29:28.704
I'm sorry.

29:28.706 --> 29:31.073
Steven didn't tell me he was
gonna get the cops involved.

29:31.075 --> 29:32.675
You told Steven about this?

29:32.677 --> 29:33.843
About the robbery?

29:33.845 --> 29:35.945
Well, I had to. I didn't have the money.

29:36.881 --> 29:39.048
And I might have fudged
some of the details.

29:39.050 --> 29:42.904
I told Steven I didn't know
they were gonna rob the house.

29:42.988 --> 29:44.620
So that's how you didn't get arrested.

29:44.622 --> 29:46.222
Well, I did it to protect you, too.

29:46.224 --> 29:48.624
If I told him I did it and about my mom,

29:48.626 --> 29:49.886
then he'd ask what you knew.

29:49.962 --> 29:51.894
And if he told Blake...

29:54.766 --> 29:57.600
I-I thought I fixed it, Cristal.
I'm sorry.

29:59.437 --> 30:01.003
What are they saying about me?

30:01.005 --> 30:02.271
Cristal...

30:02.273 --> 30:04.807
Just rip the Band-Aid off, Sam.

30:08.813 --> 30:10.413
"Million-Dollar Tramp."

30:10.415 --> 30:14.116
"Naked Ambition."

30:14.118 --> 30:16.886
And, uh, this one's kind of clever:

30:16.888 --> 30:19.322
"Private Relations."

30:19.324 --> 30:21.757
Like, they crossed out "public."

30:21.759 --> 30:23.726
It's charming.

30:23.728 --> 30:25.928
I'm Atlanta's biggest slut.

30:25.930 --> 30:29.899
Well, I can't speak to that, but...

30:29.901 --> 30:31.868
looks like Fallon can.

30:31.870 --> 30:33.236
Fallon, Fallon!
Can you comment on

30:33.238 --> 30:34.403
the sex tape that's just surfaced?

30:34.405 --> 30:36.372
Uh, well,
I know about as much as you do.

30:36.374 --> 30:38.508
You know, I can't comment on
somebody else's proclivities.

30:38.510 --> 30:40.776
I think those are questions
for the movie star.

30:43.047 --> 30:45.348
That bitch.

30:48.653 --> 30:49.919
Willy.

30:49.921 --> 30:51.587
Uh, I wasn't sure you'd pick up.

30:51.589 --> 30:52.788
I've tried everyone.

30:52.790 --> 30:53.850
Stansfield hung up on me.

30:53.892 --> 30:55.208
The FBI won't even call me back.

30:55.293 --> 30:57.293
The FBI? What's going on?

30:57.295 --> 30:59.362
You've seen this tape of Matthew
and Cristal, haven't you?

30:59.364 --> 31:00.596
Unfortunately.

31:00.598 --> 31:01.764
Has Claudia?

31:01.766 --> 31:03.499
Yeah, she's seen it.

31:03.501 --> 31:05.334
I just got back from her house.
She's a mess.

31:05.336 --> 31:07.270
She may not be able
to fight for herself,

31:07.272 --> 31:09.405
but you can be damn sure
I'm gonna fight for her.

31:09.407 --> 31:11.063
This tape... i-it's motive.

31:11.109 --> 31:13.843
Blake didn't want his new wife's
old boyfriend hanging around.

31:15.280 --> 31:16.646
Wait.

31:16.648 --> 31:18.681
You still think my dad killed Matthew?

31:18.683 --> 31:19.982
It wasn't you.

31:19.984 --> 31:21.150
You were Matthew's friend.

31:21.152 --> 31:23.653
Maybe the only good
one left in that house.

31:25.290 --> 31:28.291
Where are you right now?
I'm coming to meet you.

31:28.751 --> 31:30.426
As I've told everyone else,

31:30.428 --> 31:31.677
this is between my father

31:31.730 --> 31:33.603
and his surprisingly flexible new bride.

31:33.666 --> 31:36.933
It's a private family matter.

31:36.935 --> 31:38.768
About as private as a circus.

31:38.770 --> 31:40.169
Hey.

31:41.297 --> 31:42.939
What happened to you last night?

31:42.941 --> 31:45.141
I came to find you. You were gone.

31:45.143 --> 31:47.310
Well, I had every newspaper in Atlanta

31:47.312 --> 31:49.312
calling me about Cristal's porno.

31:49.314 --> 31:50.513
I texted you.

31:50.515 --> 31:53.182
That's why you bailed on our plan?

31:53.184 --> 31:56.419
To give interviews about
your stepmother's sex tape?

31:56.421 --> 32:00.423
You took your eye off the prize
to take a swipe at Cristal.

32:00.425 --> 32:02.686
You really can't help yourself, can you?

32:02.727 --> 32:04.121
Well, she's not just my stepmother.

32:04.162 --> 32:06.562
She's also the new COO
of our main competition

32:06.564 --> 32:07.997
of this new deal we're trying to strike.

32:07.999 --> 32:09.599
That's right.<i> We.</i>

32:09.601 --> 32:11.267
And I was there for you, Fallon.

32:11.269 --> 32:14.570
I put myself on the line
for a deal you had to have.

32:14.572 --> 32:16.238
But you made me look like an idiot,

32:16.240 --> 32:17.770
because you're only out for yourself.

32:17.843 --> 32:20.710
Must be genetic.

32:20.712 --> 32:24.614
And speaking of our main competition,
congratulations.

32:24.616 --> 32:26.515
Carrington Atlantic lost the contract.

32:26.517 --> 32:27.883
Kori just called me.

32:27.885 --> 32:30.987
- Wait, we got it?
- No. Southern Power did.

32:30.989 --> 32:33.255
The Morell Corp presentation

32:33.257 --> 32:36.325
wasn't concrete enough
for the city council.

32:36.327 --> 32:38.661
That was all you, remember?

32:39.734 --> 32:43.566
I'm guessing you didn't
play team sports as a kid.

32:43.568 --> 32:45.935
But we're supposed to
be in this together.

32:45.937 --> 32:49.271
You're no longer the only one
who pays for your mistakes.

32:51.576 --> 32:53.009
Willy?

32:53.011 --> 32:55.144
It's Steven.

33:20.872 --> 33:23.072
Hello?

33:30.356 --> 33:31.388
<i>I just can't believe it.</i>

33:31.390 --> 33:33.390
Toxicology will confirm

33:33.392 --> 33:35.025
his death looks like a suicide.

33:35.027 --> 33:37.627
He had a bottle of
sleeping pills next to him.

33:37.629 --> 33:39.296
And there was a note

33:39.298 --> 33:42.199
claiming responsibility for
the Windbriar explosion.

33:42.201 --> 33:43.567
That doesn't make sense.

33:43.569 --> 33:45.369
Willy called me,

33:45.371 --> 33:46.937
and I didn't see a note.

33:46.939 --> 33:49.239
One of my detectives
discovered it in the bedroom.

33:49.241 --> 33:53.310
And it seems Willy was
angry at Carrington Atlantic

33:53.312 --> 33:55.779
for twice denying him a promotion.

33:55.781 --> 33:57.581
So he killed Matthew?

33:57.583 --> 33:58.882
Apparently he didn't intend to.

33:58.884 --> 34:00.817
He was trying to sabotage the operation

34:00.819 --> 34:03.653
and damage Carrington
Atlantic equipment.

34:03.655 --> 34:05.222
His friend Matthew

34:05.224 --> 34:07.391
was collateral damage, it seems.

34:07.393 --> 34:09.359
And then seeing his name dragged

34:09.360 --> 34:11.594
through the mud these last 24 hours...

34:11.597 --> 34:13.230
it was too much.

34:14.010 --> 34:15.665
Does the FBI know about this?

34:15.667 --> 34:16.933
They've already been alerted.

34:16.935 --> 34:19.070
And, um, they're confirming his story,

34:19.105 --> 34:20.871
but it's just a formality.

34:20.873 --> 34:23.340
And once the toxicology comes out,

34:23.342 --> 34:26.143
charges against you will be dropped.

34:26.145 --> 34:27.978
The Horse Whisperer rides again.

34:27.980 --> 34:29.146
What about Claudia?

34:29.148 --> 34:30.179
Has anyone spoken to her?

34:30.181 --> 34:31.782
We're sending someone over now.

34:31.784 --> 34:33.016
Oh, my God.

34:33.018 --> 34:35.085
It's not how we expected this to end,

34:35.087 --> 34:37.420
but at least...

34:37.422 --> 34:39.856
she'll finally have some closure.

34:42.060 --> 34:44.393
Hey.

34:46.264 --> 34:47.563
I don't understand.

34:47.565 --> 34:49.266
It's been a rough day, hasn't it?

34:50.925 --> 34:52.702
While I'm here...

34:52.704 --> 34:55.071
I believe you have something for me.

35:04.716 --> 35:06.183
Hey.

35:07.352 --> 35:08.919
You okay?

35:08.954 --> 35:11.621
No.

35:11.623 --> 35:12.856
I was there.

35:12.858 --> 35:14.891
I saw Willy, and I didn't see a note.

35:14.893 --> 35:17.861
And what, then Stansfield's
guy just happens to find one?

35:17.863 --> 35:19.763
That lets us all off the hook?

35:19.765 --> 35:21.598
If anything,
shouldn't I be more of a suspect?

35:21.600 --> 35:22.866
I was the one that found him.

35:22.868 --> 35:24.000
What are you trying to say, Steven?

35:24.002 --> 35:26.303
Just...

35:26.305 --> 35:27.471
It seems off.

35:27.473 --> 35:29.172
A week ago, Willy was in this house,

35:29.174 --> 35:31.107
accusing you of killing Matthew.

35:31.142 --> 35:33.128
Why would he suddenly admit it now?

35:33.163 --> 35:35.345
Guilt is an unpredictable animal.

35:35.347 --> 35:37.214
Or Stansfield is.

35:37.216 --> 35:38.381
I know you're shaken right now.

35:38.383 --> 35:39.749
We've all been through the wringer.

35:39.751 --> 35:41.751
But Stansfield is not a bad guy.

35:43.155 --> 35:45.322
He's only helped this family.

35:59.058 --> 36:00.370
Whoa.

36:00.372 --> 36:02.939
Did someone go a little too
hard at the club last night?

36:02.941 --> 36:04.541
No, I'm just beat.

36:04.543 --> 36:06.476
Ugh. Me, too.

36:06.478 --> 36:10.080
And if I have to take one more
call to comment on this video...

36:10.082 --> 36:12.941
It's not even news anymore.
Even I'm over it.

36:12.976 --> 36:14.718
- Are you?
- Sorry?

36:14.720 --> 36:16.453
Well, you took that phone, didn't you?

36:16.455 --> 36:17.954
You leaked the video.

36:17.956 --> 36:19.556
I didn't take the phone.

36:20.179 --> 36:21.958
You're like a human bulldozer.

36:21.960 --> 36:23.527
- And you'll crush anyone.
- Please.

36:23.529 --> 36:24.828
Cristal's a big girl, Michael.

36:24.830 --> 36:26.296
She doesn't need you defending her.

36:26.298 --> 36:28.732
Maybe someone should defend the
world from Fallon Carrington.

36:29.673 --> 36:31.601
The way you treat her,
the way you treated Kori...

36:32.662 --> 36:33.870
Kori?

36:34.706 --> 36:36.806
You just don't see other people.

36:36.808 --> 36:39.109
Kori just hates me because I
was a bitch in high school.

36:39.111 --> 36:41.411
And I was a bitch because when
your mom leaves in the middle

36:41.413 --> 36:43.246
of sophomore year,
it kind of messes with your head.

36:43.248 --> 36:45.916
I mean, if I didn't defend myself,
who would've?

36:49.588 --> 36:50.921
That is heartbreaking.

36:51.736 --> 36:53.857
But it was almost ten years ago.

36:53.859 --> 36:55.525
Maybe you should stop blaming your mom

36:55.527 --> 36:58.428
and try to figure out why
you're so screwed up now.

37:15.484 --> 37:17.180
Hey.

37:17.182 --> 37:20.050
I'm sorry I didn't get a
chance to congratulate you.

37:20.052 --> 37:22.419
I was actually coming
to apologize to you.

37:23.136 --> 37:25.188
What you said yesterday,
about my privilege...

37:25.190 --> 37:27.357
you were right.

37:27.359 --> 37:28.992
I should have been honest.

37:28.994 --> 37:31.461
I was trying to protect you, but...

37:32.132 --> 37:33.671
I just ended up hurting more people.

37:33.706 --> 37:34.982
Don't feel too bad.

37:35.017 --> 37:36.433
You were right about that guy.

37:36.435 --> 37:38.501
I shouldn't have trusted him.

37:38.503 --> 37:41.771
But the thing is...
I should've been arrested, too.

37:41.773 --> 37:43.740
What? Why?

37:43.742 --> 37:45.342
Because I set it up.

37:47.635 --> 37:49.846
I told him to steal my aunt's ring.

37:50.258 --> 37:51.457
Are you kidding me?

37:51.459 --> 37:52.658
I know.

37:53.595 --> 37:55.728
But my mom needed money,
fast, and I panicked.

37:55.730 --> 37:57.964
You're the reason that
all of this has happened?

37:57.966 --> 37:59.833
It got out of control.
And I needed you to help me,

37:59.915 --> 38:01.848
and I didn't think you would
if I told you the truth.

38:01.850 --> 38:03.416
- You're damn right I wouldn't.
- I know how much

38:03.418 --> 38:05.485
you hate being lied to;
that's why I wanted to come clean.

38:05.487 --> 38:06.720
What, you think that fixes this?

38:07.482 --> 38:08.221
I did all of this help you,

38:08.223 --> 38:10.257
and now you're telling me
that it's all your fault?

38:10.259 --> 38:11.591
I know. I'm sorry.

38:12.721 --> 38:13.627
Well, I don't accept that.

38:14.681 --> 38:16.663
And I get now why your
aunt didn't want you here.

38:23.878 --> 38:26.479
The press isn't going away.

38:26.481 --> 38:28.514
I think I need to make a statement.

38:28.516 --> 38:29.816
I'm not gonna make you do that again.

38:29.818 --> 38:32.819
Let the FBI tell them about Willy.

38:32.821 --> 38:34.554
It's not about Willy.

38:34.556 --> 38:37.423
I didn't get a say in
this thing getting out.

38:37.425 --> 38:39.025
I should have told you about the phone.

38:41.896 --> 38:44.097
I should have told
you about the robbery.

38:44.099 --> 38:45.565
After the fact,

38:45.567 --> 38:47.400
Sam told me that it was his friend

38:47.402 --> 38:48.835
and that he was involved.

38:48.837 --> 38:52.405
And I should have told you,
but he's a good kid, Blake.

38:52.407 --> 38:54.173
He made a mistake.

38:55.744 --> 38:59.278
Well, on any other day,
I would probably be upset,

38:59.280 --> 39:02.915
but... I made a mistake, too.

39:03.749 --> 39:05.618
Do you remember the day

39:05.620 --> 39:08.321
we took our engagement photos
and Matthew came to the house?

39:08.323 --> 39:08.923
Of course.

39:08.924 --> 39:10.201
And I told you we didn't argue.

39:10.259 --> 39:11.958
Well, he threatened me with blackmail.

39:11.960 --> 39:13.559
He said that you would not marry me

39:13.561 --> 39:15.428
if you knew what kind of man I was.

39:15.430 --> 39:16.796
Blackmail you with what?

39:16.798 --> 39:19.565
Steven. Look, you know
that before Steven ran off

39:19.567 --> 39:22.969
to dig wells in Haiti that
he was with the company.

39:22.971 --> 39:24.070
He didn't want the job,

39:24.072 --> 39:25.972
and I pushed him up the ladder too fast.

39:25.974 --> 39:27.440
Out in the field one day,

39:27.442 --> 39:29.008
he missed a faulty pressure valve,

39:29.010 --> 39:30.843
and he signed off on the inspection.

39:30.845 --> 39:31.811
Oh, my God.

39:31.813 --> 39:33.346
Later, when they put it online,

39:33.348 --> 39:35.081
the pressure shook the rig,
a man fell off

39:35.083 --> 39:36.449
and snapped his neck.

39:36.451 --> 39:37.911
How come I never heard about this?

39:37.986 --> 39:39.919
Matthew was the field engineer on site.

39:39.921 --> 39:43.723
I asked him to write it
off as a structural defect.

39:43.725 --> 39:44.867
You covered it up.

39:44.960 --> 39:47.894
And Matthew claimed to have
a record of it on his phone.

39:49.264 --> 39:51.531
<i>So, I knew if Steven ever found out</i>

39:51.533 --> 39:53.533
<i>he had something to do
with the man's death,</i>

39:53.535 --> 39:55.835
<i>he would never have
stopped blaming himself.</i>

39:55.837 --> 39:57.804
But the victim is described as...

39:57.806 --> 40:00.406
<i>I was trying to protect him.</i>

40:00.408 --> 40:02.875
I-I ended up sacrificing you.

40:02.877 --> 40:05.311
I'm-I'm so sorry, Cristal.

40:06.581 --> 40:08.815
I understand.

40:08.817 --> 40:11.417
I was just trying to protect Sam.

40:11.419 --> 40:13.186
That's what family does.

40:13.188 --> 40:16.189
<i>No matter how hard or how much it hurts.</i>

40:16.191 --> 40:19.192
<i>We stand by them.</i>

40:40.228 --> 40:41.180
<i>But you and I...</i>

40:43.618 --> 40:46.085
...I don't want us to have secrets.

40:46.087 --> 40:49.322
I want to trust you,
and I want you to trust me.

40:50.505 --> 40:52.525
Can we start again?

40:52.527 --> 40:54.961
Clean slate?

40:54.963 --> 40:56.829
No more lies.

40:59.000 --> 41:01.200
No more lies.

41:06.407 --> 41:08.409
