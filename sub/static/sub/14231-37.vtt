[Goofy] I can't open it, Maxie.
I just can't.

01:09.861 --> 01:12.572
Dad, just because someone
sent you a telegram

01:12.655 --> 01:14.574
doesn't mean it's bad news.

01:14.657 --> 01:15.867
You're right, Maxie.

01:17.911 --> 01:19.120
It's bad news.

01:19.204 --> 01:21.748
My great-grand-uncle Dr. Frankengoof

01:21.831 --> 01:23.083
passed away. [sighs]

01:23.166 --> 01:24.918
And I never even got to meet him.

01:25.001 --> 01:28.672
Maybe not, but it says here
you're inheriting his castle!

01:28.755 --> 01:30.423
-I am?
-Yeah, Pop!

01:30.507 --> 01:32.008
You're his heir,

01:32.092 --> 01:34.177
the last remaining head of household.

01:34.260 --> 01:35.595
Imagine that!

01:35.679 --> 01:38.306
I'm the family heir-head!

01:39.182 --> 01:43.228
Say, Petey, can I borrow a set
of your luggage and some suitcases too?

01:43.311 --> 01:45.063
You're moving away?

01:45.146 --> 01:46.648
I'm gonna miss you, Goof.

01:46.731 --> 01:48.316
How about I drive you to the airport?

01:48.400 --> 01:50.068
Maybe get you on an earlier flight?

01:50.151 --> 01:53.238
But I'm not moving!
Uh, just taking a trip.

01:53.321 --> 01:54.656
You're not moving?

01:54.739 --> 01:55.865
Lookie here!

01:55.949 --> 01:59.661
I inherited a genuine castle
in the old country.

01:59.744 --> 02:01.246
A castle, huh?

02:01.329 --> 02:02.997
[cash register ringing]

02:06.543 --> 02:11.381
Aw. I'd sure hate to be in your shoes,
Goofster.

02:11.464 --> 02:15.969
Owning a castle
could be a real nightmarish nightmare!

02:16.052 --> 02:17.095
It can?

02:17.178 --> 02:19.556
Sure! You got your moat tax,

02:19.639 --> 02:22.475
your peasant tax, your dungeon tax...

02:22.559 --> 02:26.479
Not to mention
your fire-breathing dragon tax.

02:26.563 --> 02:29.691
Gawrsh, Petey. What am I gonna do?

02:29.774 --> 02:33.945
If only you had a partner
to take some financial burden

02:34.029 --> 02:36.239
off of your fiduciary influx.

02:36.322 --> 02:37.907
A partner?

02:37.991 --> 02:39.534
Why didn't I think of that?

02:39.617 --> 02:41.161
Tell you what, I'll do it for, say,

02:41.244 --> 02:43.621
a 50% interest in the castle!

02:43.705 --> 02:46.374
Thanks, Petey! You're a pal!

02:46.833 --> 02:48.043
[Pete] That's right, that's right.

02:48.126 --> 02:49.669
We're going on vacation!

02:49.753 --> 02:53.006
And it's someplace
you guys are gonna love!

02:53.089 --> 02:54.674
Oh, Hawaii!

02:54.758 --> 02:56.092
Australia!

02:56.176 --> 02:57.260
El Monte!

02:57.344 --> 02:59.346

[yodeling]

03:09.022 --> 03:10.732
Is that man sick, Mommy?

03:10.815 --> 03:13.568
No, Pistol honey. He's yodeling.

03:14.861 --> 03:16.196
Anyone know where we can find

03:16.279 --> 03:17.822
the Frankengoof castle?

03:18.698 --> 03:20.492
What want you to go there for?

03:20.575 --> 03:22.994
Don't you get it? He's one of them.

03:23.078 --> 03:26.039
He's got the Frankengoof nose.

03:26.122 --> 03:27.123
I do?

03:27.207 --> 03:28.875
Thought we were rid of your kind

03:28.958 --> 03:30.251
once and for all!

03:30.335 --> 03:34.047
Go back where you came from, Frankengoof!

03:34.130 --> 03:37.050
Wow. Major attitude problem!

03:39.219 --> 03:43.556
I wonder which one of these castles
is mine-- er, ours.

03:43.640 --> 03:45.308
Oh! Yes.

03:45.392 --> 03:47.435
Yes, yes.

03:47.519 --> 03:49.521
Yes, yes, yes!

03:49.604 --> 03:53.525
Richness beyond my wildest dreams!
[laughing]

03:55.402 --> 03:59.739
Hey, Pop. Uh, this sign says
Frankengoof castle is up there!

04:00.490 --> 04:02.659
[wolf howling]

04:02.742 --> 04:05.870
[Pete] That's Frankengoof castle?

04:07.914 --> 04:11.001
Hello. Anyone home?

04:11.084 --> 04:13.503
Yodelay-hee-hoo?

04:13.586 --> 04:16.256
Yodelay-hee-hoo?

04:21.970 --> 04:23.638
Come on, children, we've had a long trip.

04:23.722 --> 04:26.099
Let's go unpack and take naps.

04:26.182 --> 04:27.684
And don't touch anything.

04:27.767 --> 04:32.355
Gawrsh, it's even more
beautiful than I imagined.

04:34.232 --> 04:36.317
Knock-knock.

04:36.401 --> 04:37.819
Who's there? [shrieking]

04:38.903 --> 04:41.239
Who, or what, are you?

04:41.322 --> 04:43.700
I'm Igor, the caretaker.

04:43.783 --> 04:47.245
I'm responsible
for the way the castle looks.

04:47.829 --> 04:52.250
First thing in the morning,
we look for a new caretaker.

04:52.334 --> 04:55.128
Oh! And you must be the heir!

04:55.211 --> 04:56.838
Yup. How did you know?

04:56.921 --> 04:59.215
Why, you have the Frankengoof nose.

04:59.299 --> 05:01.801
Cuckoo, nevermore. Cuckoo, nevermore.

05:01.885 --> 05:05.055
Uh-oh. Almost time for the 4:00 pelting.

05:05.138 --> 05:07.640
What 4:00 pelting?

05:07.724 --> 05:10.060
[Villagers] No more Frankengoofs!

05:10.143 --> 05:11.603
-Go home!
-You're not wanted here!

05:11.686 --> 05:13.605
Some welcome wagon, Igor.

05:13.688 --> 05:16.441
Yeah, how come the locals
are so hot under the collar?

05:16.524 --> 05:18.276
Because of Dr. Frankengoof.

05:18.360 --> 05:20.195
They thought he was insane.

05:20.278 --> 05:23.406
[laughing] He was no more insane than me!

05:23.490 --> 05:26.242
[crazed laughing]

05:28.244 --> 05:30.789
[Igor] For a mad scientist,
he was very sweet.

05:30.872 --> 05:34.501
Always with a smile on his
lips and a twinkle in his eye.

05:36.461 --> 05:37.962
When he wasn't busy

05:38.046 --> 05:40.590
experimenting and amusing his friends,

05:40.674 --> 05:44.844
he was treating yours truly
with tender loving care.

05:44.928 --> 05:48.515
Oh, please, oh, please,
just one notch higher.

05:50.350 --> 05:52.977
Oh, thank you, master.

05:53.770 --> 05:55.647
But for all his charm,

05:55.730 --> 05:59.901
the one thing the villagers
never could accept was

05:59.984 --> 06:02.487
his monster!

06:03.488 --> 06:05.156
[Both] M-m-monster?

06:07.409 --> 06:10.078
I shall never forget that fateful night!

06:13.748 --> 06:17.877
Frankengoof: Enough, Igor!
Lower the table.

06:17.961 --> 06:20.630
Oh, yes, master.

06:26.636 --> 06:29.180
Look, Igor, it's moving!

06:31.933 --> 06:36.354
It's alive! It's alive!
It's alive! It's alive!

06:36.438 --> 06:38.064
Ah-hyuck! Ah-hyuck!

06:39.607 --> 06:43.194
[sighs] Oh, how the villagers
hated the monster.

06:43.278 --> 06:44.696
Never again was your uncle invited

06:44.779 --> 06:46.614
to a dinner party or buffet lunch!

06:47.073 --> 06:51.077
Gawrsh, I never realized
what a colorful family I had.

06:51.161 --> 06:53.329
Oh, come on, there's no monster.

06:53.413 --> 06:55.415
Only a lamebrain would believe that story.

06:55.498 --> 06:58.376
I'm gonna check out
the rest of this rat-trap.

06:58.460 --> 07:01.296
Maybe I'll find some antiques
worth selling.

07:01.379 --> 07:03.298
Uh, wait for me, Petey.

07:04.049 --> 07:07.093
[Pete] Boy, this is some castle
we inherited, Goof.

07:07.177 --> 07:09.679
It's full of nothing but worthless junk.

07:11.389 --> 07:13.475
Look, Petey, some kind of switch!

07:13.558 --> 07:16.061
Oh, I'll bet it opens a secret passageway

07:16.144 --> 07:18.021
or a hidden cave!

07:18.104 --> 07:21.232
Oh, you Goof!
You been watching too many movies.

07:23.485 --> 07:24.694
[screaming]

07:24.778 --> 07:27.322
Or maybe a trap door!

07:27.405 --> 07:29.991
[yelling]

07:43.755 --> 07:44.756
[sighs]

07:44.839 --> 07:46.883
How'd you get here?

07:46.966 --> 07:48.551
I took the stairs.

07:48.635 --> 07:49.678
[groans]

07:55.225 --> 07:56.810
Wonder what this does.

07:57.811 --> 07:59.479
[screaming]

08:01.147 --> 08:02.607
Guess it's not hooked up.

08:04.859 --> 08:06.695
I'm gonna hook you up, you--

08:06.778 --> 08:09.280
[gulps] What's that?

08:09.364 --> 08:11.408
I don't know, Petey.

08:11.491 --> 08:13.618
I think you should check.

08:14.494 --> 08:16.996
Gawrsh! It's the Frankengoof monster!

08:17.080 --> 08:19.374
Ugly, ugly, ugly.

08:19.457 --> 08:21.960
Hmm, well, I don't know.

08:22.043 --> 08:24.254
I think he looks kind of...

08:24.337 --> 08:25.964
Ruggedly handsome.

08:26.047 --> 08:27.090
Knock-knock.

08:27.173 --> 08:28.466
Who's there? Yow!

08:30.510 --> 08:33.346
You like the monster?
I put in the eyes myself.

08:33.471 --> 08:36.224
Come on, that's just a-- a dummy.

08:36.307 --> 08:37.809
Attractive, but a dummy.

08:37.892 --> 08:41.312
Oh, no, no, no, it is real!
Ghoul's honor!

08:41.396 --> 08:42.981
[laughs] That's cute!

08:43.064 --> 08:45.275
So how come it doesn't move, hmm?

08:45.358 --> 08:48.111
I don't know how to bring it to life.

08:48.194 --> 08:51.364
Only a Frankengoof
can revive the monster.

08:52.949 --> 08:54.659
Wake up.

08:54.743 --> 08:56.911
Well, gave it my best shot.

08:57.245 --> 09:00.915
[Pete] So the Goof believes in monsters,
does he?

09:00.999 --> 09:03.793
[laughing] That's good for me!

09:03.877 --> 09:05.628
I'll give him such a scare,

09:05.712 --> 09:08.673
he'll beg me to buy his share
of the castle cheap.

09:08.757 --> 09:12.177
Then I can make this place pay off.

09:12.260 --> 09:15.764
Yodeling Pete's old world rvs.
[laughing]

09:15.847 --> 09:17.724
I like the sound of that.

09:17.807 --> 09:20.894
Hmm, need some green paint.

09:20.977 --> 09:23.563
I bet there's some out
in the old tool shed!

09:24.356 --> 09:27.317
Perfect. Can't wait to see
the Goof's face when I--

09:27.400 --> 09:29.527
[struggling] Rats!

09:29.611 --> 09:32.489
I locked myself out. No problem.

09:32.572 --> 09:34.157
I'll just climb in.

09:37.077 --> 09:39.871
[shivering] Ooh. Getting cold.

09:42.624 --> 09:44.918
[howling]

09:45.001 --> 09:46.211
[crash]

09:46.294 --> 09:48.838
Hmm. I wonder what that was.

09:48.922 --> 09:52.592
Did it sound like this?
[howling]

09:53.009 --> 09:55.512
Yeah, it did.

09:55.595 --> 09:57.138
Werewolves!

09:57.222 --> 09:59.974
I'll let out the hounds, master.

10:01.643 --> 10:04.604
-[dog snarling]
-[screaming]

10:04.688 --> 10:06.314
Whoa! Nice doggie!

10:06.398 --> 10:07.649
[screaming continues]

10:07.732 --> 10:09.359
I like puppies!

10:09.442 --> 10:11.069
[screaming]

10:12.237 --> 10:14.447
[dog howling]

10:15.532 --> 10:18.576
Hmm. Maybe I just imaginated the noise.

10:24.666 --> 10:26.334
[snarling]

10:30.171 --> 10:31.881
-[Pete] Whoa! Nice doggies.
-[dog barking]

10:31.965 --> 10:34.551
[screaming] I like puppies.

10:34.634 --> 10:36.302
Whoa!

10:39.597 --> 10:43.309
[panting] I lost him.

10:44.310 --> 10:45.395
Ooh, a phone.

10:45.478 --> 10:46.646
I better call the Goof,

10:46.730 --> 10:48.231
have him come pick me up.

10:48.314 --> 10:50.650
Hey, buddy, hurry it up, will you?

10:55.739 --> 10:57.032
[screaming]

10:57.115 --> 11:00.368
A simple no would have sufficed!

11:06.249 --> 11:07.959
Say, you got a phone in here?

11:08.043 --> 11:10.253
[panicked screaming]

11:15.967 --> 11:18.261
Hmm! Must've been something they ate.

11:25.894 --> 11:28.897
It's him. The Frankengoof monster!

11:30.732 --> 11:32.233
Where? Where?

11:32.317 --> 11:34.402
You! You're the monster!

11:34.486 --> 11:37.322
Me? I'm a used car salesman.

11:38.073 --> 11:39.074
Same thing.

11:39.157 --> 11:40.492
Oh, oh!

11:40.575 --> 11:41.576
The costume.

11:41.659 --> 11:43.036
Uh, uh, these are fake, see?

11:43.119 --> 11:45.580
Look, they come right off.
[gulping]

11:45.663 --> 11:47.332
Glue must've hardened.

11:47.415 --> 11:49.542
Uh, now, now this-- this is paint, see?

'Cause it wipes right off.
Look! [garbling]

11:53.630 --> 11:56.800
Your monster tricks won't work on us,
you monster.

11:56.883 --> 12:00.136
Look, a-- a werewolf!

12:02.013 --> 12:03.848
He's escaped!

12:03.932 --> 12:06.851
Ah, he's a clever one, all right!

12:08.520 --> 12:10.605
[breathlessly] Please!

12:10.689 --> 12:13.441
You got to help me! They're after me!

12:13.525 --> 12:15.944
Oh, sure. I'll help you. Just wait here.

12:16.027 --> 12:17.696
Hold these, please.

12:19.781 --> 12:21.616
Hey, everybody, the monster's here!

12:21.700 --> 12:23.284
And he took my daisies!

12:35.922 --> 12:38.091
[groaning]

12:39.926 --> 12:42.470
Stop that, Pete-ums!
You'll ruin your appetite.

12:42.554 --> 12:43.680
[growling]

12:45.598 --> 12:46.933
Honestly, Pete!

12:47.017 --> 12:49.310
Sometimes you can be such a pig!

12:49.394 --> 12:51.479
Maybe if you ate more sensibly,

12:51.563 --> 12:53.231
you wouldn't look so green.

12:53.314 --> 12:54.816
Not to mention your weight!

12:54.899 --> 12:57.318
You're even getting love handles
in your neck!

13:08.204 --> 13:10.206
I think he went that way!

13:11.750 --> 13:14.127
I need a place to hide. [panting]

13:14.794 --> 13:18.048
Perfect!
They never look for monsters in windmills!

13:34.064 --> 13:36.149
[gasping] I'll just wait it out

13:36.232 --> 13:38.193
until they give up looking for me.

13:38.276 --> 13:40.028
I'll be safe here.

Whoa!

13:46.618 --> 13:49.996
Mommy, Petey wanna go home now.

13:53.249 --> 13:55.543
Would you mind helping me beat the rug?

13:57.837 --> 14:00.882
Goofy, have you noticed
the change in Pete?

14:00.965 --> 14:03.510
He's being so helpful and cooperative.

14:03.593 --> 14:04.928
It must be this vacation.

14:05.011 --> 14:06.846
It's really done him some good.

14:06.971 --> 14:08.556
Yeah, I can't remember

14:08.640 --> 14:10.809
when Petey's been in such a good mood!

14:11.309 --> 14:14.145
Hey, Pop, can you help us
fix Max' skateboard?

14:20.819 --> 14:22.445

14:28.159 --> 14:29.786
Daddy, Daddy, Daddy,
can you help me, please?

14:29.869 --> 14:31.496
I dropped my Dolly in the couch.

14:37.585 --> 14:41.506
Thank you, Daddy.
You're the best daddy in the whole world!

14:41.589 --> 14:45.844
Oh! I think we're seeing
a brand-new Pete-ums!

14:45.927 --> 14:49.097
Might I take the youngsters
to see the sights, mistress?

14:49.180 --> 14:51.725
It is grave-hog's day.

14:51.808 --> 14:55.395
[P.J] Oh! I love grave-hogs!
Please, Ma, can we, can we, huh?

14:55.478 --> 14:58.064
Well, all right.

14:58.148 --> 14:59.691
But don't wander too far.

14:59.774 --> 15:01.276
Dinner's in an hour.

15:01.359 --> 15:02.861
Oh, yum yum!

15:02.944 --> 15:05.071
I do hope we're having bat on a stick.

15:05.155 --> 15:06.614
It's my favorite!

15:11.286 --> 15:12.537

15:14.706 --> 15:17.208
Need to find something to grab hold of.

15:17.834 --> 15:21.254
Gotcha. [grunting] Now if I can just...

15:21.338 --> 15:22.922
Pull up. [grunting]

It's me! Pete!

Pete? Uh, just a second. I'll get him.

15:38.313 --> 15:40.357
Petey, it's for you.

15:42.650 --> 15:43.985
[grunting]

15:44.069 --> 15:45.653
He didn't say.

-Hello?

of electrodes to his head.

15:57.415 --> 15:59.668
No, you're not. Pete's here.

15:59.751 --> 16:02.087
How can I be there when I'm here?

Must be a prank caller
pretending to be you.

Cool! A real-live monster!

16:35.161 --> 16:38.206
Not for long! [laughing]

16:43.044 --> 16:44.587
What do we do once we get him?

16:44.671 --> 16:47.924
I say we drive a stake through his heart!

16:49.217 --> 16:51.803
No, that only work on vampire.

16:51.886 --> 16:54.180
Eh, how about the silver bullet?

16:54.264 --> 16:55.932
No, that for werewolf.

16:56.016 --> 16:58.268
How about tying the monster's legs

16:58.351 --> 17:00.895
on two trucks going opposite directions?

17:01.771 --> 17:03.440
Yeah, I saw it done in a movie once.

17:03.523 --> 17:06.276
It just might work! Let's do it!

17:10.113 --> 17:12.198
It's even grosser than I imagined!

Ew! It's the yuckiest thing
I've ever seen!

Daddy's the monster?

17:24.044 --> 17:25.587
Cool!

17:25.670 --> 17:29.341
OK, if that's Dad,
then who was that back at the castle?

17:29.424 --> 17:31.259
[all] The monster!

17:32.510 --> 17:34.262
[Peg] The monster?

17:34.346 --> 17:37.849
Are you absolutely sure
that's not my Pete-ums?

17:37.932 --> 17:39.309
Oh, yes, mistress.

17:39.392 --> 17:41.895
Not a sliver of doubt in my mind.

17:42.354 --> 17:45.398
Ah, I should've known
it was too good to be true.

17:45.774 --> 17:47.233

Come on, Mom, we better hurry!

We've tried everything.

Now, fellas, fellas, uh,
now can't we talk this over?

18:17.263 --> 18:20.558
Well, how about 5% off
on any car on my lot?

-Get the truck!
-OK, 6%.

So which is which?

with both hands tied behind his back.

That can be arranged!

How shall we ever know
which is the real monster?

I got an idea!

19:15.488 --> 19:18.742
in the movie Revenge of the Swampbeast,

19:18.825 --> 19:21.995
what color was the
Swampbeast's motorcycle?

Oh, oh! That's my favorite movie!

19:24.664 --> 19:27.083
Uh, it's, it's on the tip of my tongue.
It was--

[timer buzzing]

19:28.460 --> 19:30.462
Too late. It was a trick question anyway.

19:30.545 --> 19:32.339
I never even saw that movie.

19:32.422 --> 19:35.383
Looks like we found our Petey impostor.

should be ashamed of yourselves.

We've been bad.

I'm so ashamed.

did do a nice job

21:05.682 --> 21:07.017

21:12.022 --> 21:15.150
Ah-hyuck! He said
it was the best present he ever got,

21:15.233 --> 21:18.069
next to his collection of bat lips.
Ah-hyuck!

21:18.153 --> 21:20.697
Yeah, but one thing I don't get, Mom.

21:25.160 --> 21:27.620
Oh. I don't know.

I think he was just...
Happy to get home. [laughs]
