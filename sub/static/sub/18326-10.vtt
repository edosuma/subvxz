WEBVTT

01:04.105 --> 01:06.816
Galileo was the first person
to measure speed

01:08.359 --> 01:10.111
as distance over time.

01:12.363 --> 01:14.324
I wonder what Galileo
would have thought of this?

01:15.366 --> 01:19.537
One-twenty, one-thirty,
one-forty, one-fifty.

01:21.456 --> 01:22.874
It's not just about going fast.

01:23.541 --> 01:25.335
It's about the experience
of getting there.

01:27.545 --> 01:29.964
Just when we thought
we couldn't go any faster...

01:35.887 --> 01:37.764
We find ways to break the speed limit.

01:40.225 --> 01:43.019
It's in the nature of humans to go faster.

01:46.898 --> 01:51.694
-I have the need for speed.
-Clearly. You were going fast.

01:51.778 --> 01:53.071
I'm still on an adrenaline high.

01:53.154 --> 01:56.157
All right. We're gonna be looking
at the most insane speed freaks

01:56.241 --> 01:58.368
and finding out who's the fastest and why.

01:58.451 --> 02:00.829
Straight out the gate,
I'm going down the rabbit hole

02:00.912 --> 02:03.581
because I have a jet that
was designed in the late '50s

02:03.665 --> 02:05.667
and is still the highest speed today.

02:05.750 --> 02:07.794
I've got the fastest human alive.

02:07.877 --> 02:10.880
And he may just be the fastest
that will ever live.

02:12.048 --> 02:14.217
[Kari]
Well, Tory and I are going head to head

02:14.300 --> 02:16.719
in a race between
two gravity-powered humans.

02:17.720 --> 02:21.683
And I am gonna be looking at the fastest
electric cars from the past and present.

02:21.766 --> 02:24.227
So, let's go over our criteria
for ranking these.

02:24.310 --> 02:29.274
We have top speed, acceleration,
and then, proximity to speed limit.

02:29.357 --> 02:32.485
In other words, have they reached
the peak of their performance?

02:33.069 --> 02:36.114
Then we'll take each of these contenders,
apply our three criteria,

02:36.197 --> 02:38.116
and see which speed freak
comes out on top.

02:38.616 --> 02:39.784
Check this out.

02:39.868 --> 02:43.830
For my first contender,
I'm gonna bring a classic story

02:43.913 --> 02:47.000
from the history of speed back to life.

02:54.757 --> 02:56.217
I love going fast.

02:56.301 --> 02:58.469
And my favorite form of speed is in a car.

02:59.596 --> 03:01.389
[whooping]

03:01.931 --> 03:05.185
So, I wanted to pick a speedster
that was very unique.

03:06.561 --> 03:07.687
That looks so cool. Look at that.

03:07.937 --> 03:10.231
So, I started going through
automotive history,

03:10.315 --> 03:12.108
and then I came across this.

03:12.901 --> 03:14.819
This is the Baker Torpedo.

03:15.403 --> 03:17.197
Built back in 1902.

03:17.280 --> 03:20.283
It was low to the ground, aerodynamic
and, most importantly,

03:20.366 --> 03:21.784
it was an electric car.

03:22.452 --> 03:25.830
Some people believe
it was the fastest car on Earth.

03:27.373 --> 03:30.960
But disaster struck on the cusp
of a new land speed record.

03:31.044 --> 03:34.130
I'm convinced he was going faster
than the world record.

03:38.384 --> 03:41.679
It's time to build an electric car
from scratch.

03:41.763 --> 03:45.141
And take on that 1902 world record

03:45.642 --> 03:47.018
even if it kills me.

03:47.101 --> 03:48.102
Holy shit.

03:53.942 --> 03:57.070
Back in 1902, most cars looked like this,

03:57.904 --> 04:02.867
were powered by steam
and maxed out below 20 miles per hour.

04:04.452 --> 04:09.249
Enter pioneer, designer,
and speed freak, Walter Baker.

04:10.667 --> 04:15.463
Baker swapped steam for electricity,
revolutionized the car's shape...

04:17.048 --> 04:19.676
And set out to break
the land speed record.

04:20.343 --> 04:22.762
-Hey, Tim. How are you?
-Hey.

04:22.845 --> 04:25.848
I spoke to auto historian Tim George
to find out more.

04:25.932 --> 04:27.225
How cool is this photo?

04:27.308 --> 04:29.477
Yeah, this photograph is so stunning

04:29.560 --> 04:33.398
when you see that Baker
is in a low, aerodynamic car

04:33.481 --> 04:37.402
lined up against other cars
that look like wagons with engines.

04:38.236 --> 04:41.155
Baker made several versions
of the Torpedo.

04:41.739 --> 04:46.911
The 1902 model drew huge crowds
to Staten Island for the land speed race.

04:47.370 --> 04:49.998
Thomas Edison was there.
Henry Ford was there

04:50.081 --> 04:52.875
and up rolls this totally alien vehicle.

04:54.294 --> 04:57.880
Some people were afraid of it.
They even called it the devil's car.

04:58.673 --> 05:01.592
How fast did Baker go?
Because it's not in the record books.

05:01.676 --> 05:04.095
He was on course
to set the land speed record

05:04.178 --> 05:07.640
when he crashed into the crowd
and killed two spectators.

05:08.933 --> 05:10.601
The record was 75 miles an hour.

05:11.185 --> 05:14.731
My sense is he was going 82 miles an hour
at the time of the crash.

05:14.814 --> 05:18.860
Unfortunately, the crash is what kept him
out of the record books forever.

05:20.820 --> 05:22.989
That sounds like a challenge.
It's time to start building.

05:25.867 --> 05:28.411
I'm gonna rebuild that Torpedo
to the original specs

05:29.996 --> 05:33.082
to see if I can succeed
where Bad Luck Baker failed.

05:36.919 --> 05:41.799
To help out, I've got a pit crew
and a big name in electric custom cars.

05:41.883 --> 05:44.635
-Gadget. Thanks for coming out, man.
-Hey.

05:49.140 --> 05:52.101
[Tory] We're shooting for
the same weight, power and design.

05:52.185 --> 05:54.062
[Gadget] Axle to axle is nine foot nine.

05:54.145 --> 05:57.190
[Tory] To get started,
we mark up the dimensions.

05:57.273 --> 06:00.526
-So, I'm gonna be sitting right here.
-Just like that.

06:00.610 --> 06:01.986
And at 18-feet long...

06:02.070 --> 06:04.030
Wow, this thing is a monster.

06:04.113 --> 06:08.159
Remember there was also an engineer,
so there was a guy sitting behind you

06:08.242 --> 06:09.911
running the brakes and switches.

06:09.994 --> 06:11.120
That makes more sense.

06:11.871 --> 06:14.499
Driving the original Torpedo
was a two-man job,

06:14.582 --> 06:17.627
but I doubt anyone's gonna
wanna take this ride with me.

06:17.710 --> 06:19.170
So I'm going solo.

06:21.798 --> 06:24.258
What I'm gonna do is build
a foam mock up first.

06:25.843 --> 06:27.178
That way I can find my shape.

06:31.557 --> 06:35.144
This is what they did in 1902,
they whittled. [blows]

06:35.728 --> 06:38.856
Once we have the shape we like,
we're gonna build it out of steel.

06:41.651 --> 06:43.194
I mean, this thing's massive.

06:44.278 --> 06:46.531
I'm gonna use that foam core
as templates.

06:47.532 --> 06:49.826
I'll bend the steel according
to the foam core...

06:49.909 --> 06:51.369
[Gadget] That's the ticket.

06:51.994 --> 06:54.789
I'll weld it together
and I'll have the frame for my body.

06:55.581 --> 06:57.291
It's time for some metal.

07:03.423 --> 07:05.550
This is gonna be so sick.

07:09.303 --> 07:13.015
I'm getting excited because
the Torpedo car is starting to take shape.

07:14.600 --> 07:17.228
And that low-slung look is so modern.

07:17.311 --> 07:20.690
I mean, over 100 years later
and it still looks cool.

07:21.441 --> 07:26.070
When you consider that most of the people
went to this race on horses and buggies

07:26.154 --> 07:31.159
and up pulls this guy at the starting line
with a mid-engine car,

07:31.242 --> 07:33.911
fully aerodynamic, it's really amazing.

07:33.995 --> 07:35.746
And the fact
that it was an electric car.

07:35.830 --> 07:39.333
Like, I had no idea electric cars existed
that long ago.

07:39.834 --> 07:41.586
Yeah, starting in the late 1800s,

07:41.669 --> 07:44.046
electric cars
were the fastest cars on Earth.

07:44.130 --> 07:48.134
The first three land speed records
were held by electric cars.

07:48.217 --> 07:50.094
[Tory] Those cars were all European.

07:50.178 --> 07:52.972
Baker was out
to bring the record to America.

07:53.723 --> 07:57.894
And that meant completely rethinking
just what a car could be.

07:58.394 --> 08:02.565
Now, it's time to move on to the steering,
suspension and braking system.

08:03.316 --> 08:07.111
This front axle started life
on a vintage Nash automobile.

08:08.988 --> 08:10.948
[Tory] Kind of like we're building
a Mad Max car.

08:11.032 --> 08:14.410
-It looks so macho.
-It does look pretty badass.

08:14.494 --> 08:17.788
The rear axle is custom made
to fit the frame.

08:18.247 --> 08:19.123
There we go.

08:19.207 --> 08:22.960
Some hubs and then the brake.

08:23.044 --> 08:24.170
Singular.

08:24.253 --> 08:26.506
-[Tory] All this vehicle has is one brake.
-Right.

08:26.589 --> 08:28.466
If I get it up to 100 miles an hour,

08:28.549 --> 08:31.177
I'm gonna feather it.
I don't want this thing to lock up.

08:31.260 --> 08:32.512
No, you don't. [chuckles]

08:32.595 --> 08:36.516
[Tory] That's what happened
in the Torpedo's fateful 1902 crash

08:36.599 --> 08:39.477
when the brakeman tried to slow the car.

08:41.437 --> 08:44.774
I have to take care of braking
and steering all by myself.

08:45.358 --> 08:46.192
Yikes.

08:47.443 --> 08:51.280
Next up, powering the Torpedo
to the specs of the original.

08:52.907 --> 08:54.116
[Gadget] Watch your fingers.

08:54.200 --> 08:57.995
It's a beast of an electric motor,
it's an 11-inch diameter motor.

08:58.079 --> 09:00.289
We'll set it up
so it gives us the same power.

09:00.790 --> 09:04.335
[Tory] Baker used a bank
of innovative nickel iron batteries

09:04.418 --> 09:06.420
direct from Thomas Edison's lab.

09:06.504 --> 09:09.048
Our cell setup is a modern match.

09:09.882 --> 09:11.008
Yeah, that looks great.

09:11.092 --> 09:14.095
To accelerate,
Baker manipulated a rheostat,

09:14.762 --> 09:17.139
the electric equivalent of a gas pedal.

09:18.307 --> 09:22.103
And just like the original,
our rear axle is chain driven.

09:25.898 --> 09:29.527
All right, we've got chain clearance.
Our axle is spinning.

09:29.610 --> 09:31.195
Oh-ho-ho. [chuckles]

09:31.404 --> 09:32.488
We have power.

09:37.493 --> 09:40.580
Now, we don't know exactly
how Baker made his wheels.

09:40.663 --> 09:44.166
What we do know is they were made
mostly of wood, like a wagon wheel.

09:44.250 --> 09:49.088
In an aerodynamic first,
Baker covered the spokes to reduce drag.

09:51.090 --> 09:53.593
I'm getting a local bike shop
to hook us up

09:53.676 --> 09:55.136
with some 30-inch aluminum rims

09:55.845 --> 09:58.806
to replicate
those wind-resistant originals.

10:06.606 --> 10:08.941
All right. Good, good, good.

10:09.191 --> 10:11.152
Hey, I got the wheels.

10:11.235 --> 10:13.154
-[Gadget] Nice.
-Look at these things.

10:13.237 --> 10:14.905
These things are monsters.

10:16.115 --> 10:18.451
Let's get the car off the table
and onto jacks

10:18.534 --> 10:19.660
so we can mount the wheels.

10:23.331 --> 10:24.665
[Tory laughs]

10:24.749 --> 10:26.250
It's like it just got real.

10:26.334 --> 10:29.211
It's like before it was, like,
"Yeah, it's gonna be a car,"

10:29.295 --> 10:32.882
and now it's like,
"Oh, it's gonna be a car."

10:41.682 --> 10:44.185
Holy crap.

10:44.685 --> 10:46.145
The car looks insane,

10:46.228 --> 10:48.314
and we basically built this
from a photograph.

10:49.231 --> 10:52.109
The last thing we need to do is skin it.
But before we do that,

10:52.193 --> 10:55.905
I wanna take it for a test drive,
make sure everything is working properly.

10:55.988 --> 10:59.408
All right, here we go.
The electric car. Let's see how it runs.

11:07.541 --> 11:08.751
[Tory] Oh!

11:09.251 --> 11:10.670
-Little scrape. Oh.
-[clanging]

11:15.091 --> 11:17.593
Here we go in three, two, one.

11:23.557 --> 11:24.975
Oh, yeah!

11:26.769 --> 11:27.937
[laughs]

11:31.232 --> 11:33.067
Wow. This is cool.

11:37.822 --> 11:40.950
All right, let's skin it
and then see if we can break that record.

11:41.033 --> 11:42.284
Yeah.

11:42.493 --> 11:45.663
[Grant] For my first contender,
I'm going back to basics.

11:45.746 --> 11:50.292
I wanna see how fast humans can go
under their own power.

11:58.300 --> 12:00.803
There are seven billion people
in the world today...

12:02.847 --> 12:03.848
[crowd cheering]

12:04.890 --> 12:08.102
and Usain Bolt is the fastest one
of them all.

12:08.602 --> 12:13.107
He ran the 100-meter dash
in a record-setting 9.58 seconds.

12:14.275 --> 12:18.028
That's a top speed
of almost 28 miles per hour,

12:18.112 --> 12:22.616
and an acceleration off the blocks
of 31 feet per second per second.

12:22.700 --> 12:25.619
That's a higher acceleration
than a Porsche 911.

12:27.246 --> 12:29.540
So, that's criteria one and two
taken care of

12:29.623 --> 12:30.916
but what I'm really interested in

12:31.000 --> 12:33.961
is how close are we
to the limit of human speed?

12:34.044 --> 12:37.298
Can we go faster?
And, if so, how much?

12:38.299 --> 12:40.050
I took a look at the record books.

12:40.551 --> 12:42.595
Since the 1896 Olympics,

12:42.678 --> 12:45.473
when Thomas Burke
clocked a track time of 12 seconds,

12:45.556 --> 12:48.517
there's been a steady increase
in performance all the way up

12:48.601 --> 12:51.937
until Bolt's record-setting run in Berlin,
in 2009.

12:52.438 --> 12:57.443
For the past 100 years, at least,
humans have steadily been getting faster.

13:00.362 --> 13:02.948
But is that it?
Has the human race plateaued?

13:03.949 --> 13:04.783
Eh, maybe.

13:06.410 --> 13:10.748
Bolt thinks that 9.4 seconds
is the fastest anyone will ever run.

13:11.665 --> 13:13.876
And some people think
that the fastest person

13:13.959 --> 13:17.087
there ever will be
has already been born.

13:17.588 --> 13:21.342
Which is an opinion that's supported
by mathematician Reza Noubary.

13:21.425 --> 13:24.929
He concluded that not only
are we already at the limit,

13:25.012 --> 13:27.556
but that Bolt has marginally exceeded

13:27.640 --> 13:30.309
what statistics predict
is humanly possible.

13:30.809 --> 13:33.395
He's saying that Bolt
really is that extraordinary.

13:34.146 --> 13:36.982
But other scientists are adamant
that human beings

13:37.066 --> 13:39.860
will breach that 28-mile-per-hour ceiling.

13:40.361 --> 13:41.487
Here's Dr. Peter Weyand.

13:41.570 --> 13:44.240
At some point
somebody will run faster than that.

13:44.323 --> 13:46.825
What differentiates fast
and slow people

13:46.909 --> 13:51.288
is fast people can hit the ground harder
in relation to their bodyweight.

13:51.372 --> 13:53.165
So, somebody like Usain Bolt

13:53.249 --> 13:56.168
will hit with a peak force
of five times body weight

13:56.252 --> 13:58.170
but continuing to go faster than he goes

13:58.254 --> 14:01.090
will require him to hit even harder
than that.

14:01.590 --> 14:04.885
But a question like, "what's the ultimate
speed a human can run?"

14:04.969 --> 14:07.179
is extremely hard to answer.

14:07.888 --> 14:12.184
So, where does this leave us?
Usain Bolt is the fastest man alive.

14:12.268 --> 14:15.896
His speed and acceleration
are almost superhuman.

14:15.980 --> 14:19.066
But what I'm really interested in
is criteria number three.

14:19.149 --> 14:22.152
How close are we
to the limit of human speed?

14:22.736 --> 14:24.446
It's a tough one to call.

14:24.530 --> 14:28.784
Dr. Weyand cites 40 miles per hour
as the hypothetical maximum.

14:28.868 --> 14:31.829
But the math says we are already
at the limit.

14:32.413 --> 14:34.206
Either way, I'm backing Bolt

14:34.290 --> 14:37.710
to give Kari and Tory's speed freaks
a run for their money.

14:40.004 --> 14:42.631
[Tory] There's another way
for humans to go very fast.

14:46.677 --> 14:47.720
Add gravity.

14:50.180 --> 14:52.099
[laughing]

14:52.683 --> 14:55.769
Accomplished skiers average
about 40 miles per hour.

14:56.520 --> 14:58.772
Here's me doing 12.

15:00.900 --> 15:03.736
Conventional skydivers
hit terminal velocity

15:03.819 --> 15:05.863
at 120 miles per hour.

15:10.784 --> 15:13.245
But we're looking
for serious speed freaks.

15:20.294 --> 15:23.130
To find the fastest non-motorized human
on the planet,

15:24.131 --> 15:26.800
we're taking the two sports
with a claim to that title

15:27.593 --> 15:29.511
and putting them head-to-head.

15:33.057 --> 15:35.476
All right, Joss,
so tell me about speed skiing.

15:35.559 --> 15:38.103
-This is an actual sport?
-It's an actual sport.

15:38.187 --> 15:40.481
Basically, it's all about
going as fast as you can

15:40.564 --> 15:41.774
on skis with no motor.

15:43.025 --> 15:45.444
[Tory] In the international sport
of speed skiing,

15:45.527 --> 15:47.738
the track is around one kilometer long,

15:47.821 --> 15:52.660
and a 100-meter timing zone is marked out
on the fastest part of the course.

15:53.702 --> 15:56.330
Everything about the sport
is geared for speed.

15:56.413 --> 15:58.457
The key is to reduce friction

15:58.540 --> 16:01.877
with body position
and state-of-the-art materials.

16:02.878 --> 16:05.506
I would say that speed skiers
are known for their equipment,

16:05.589 --> 16:06.507
not by what they do.

16:08.884 --> 16:12.596
[Tory] Airtight latex
reduces wind resistance.

16:15.182 --> 16:17.726
We've got crazy long skis.
They're eight-feet long.

16:17.810 --> 16:19.561
[Tory] The larger the ski's surface area,

16:19.645 --> 16:22.439
the more efficiently
the weight is distributed,

16:22.523 --> 16:24.400
which, in turn, reduces friction.

16:24.483 --> 16:27.236
We've got these things
behind our legs called fairings.

16:27.945 --> 16:30.990
[Tory] The aerodynamic profile
decreases drag.

16:32.825 --> 16:36.829
And finally, to pierce the air
like a jet fighter nose cone:

16:37.329 --> 16:40.499
[Joss] The helmet is a fiberglass shell,
just purely for aerodynamics,

16:40.582 --> 16:42.418
that fits over our normal ski helmet.

16:45.170 --> 16:47.172
[Tory] It's a crazy setup, but...

16:47.673 --> 16:50.801
What if we were to leave the land
and take to the sky?

16:51.593 --> 16:56.682
Welcome to the wild and dangerous
world of speed skydiving.

17:01.812 --> 17:04.523
Now, how fast can
you go speed skydiving?

17:04.606 --> 17:07.526
I know terminal velocity
is like 120 miles an hour.

17:07.609 --> 17:08.610
What can you guys do?

17:08.694 --> 17:11.113
Normal speed for a skydiver
in a belly orientation

17:11.196 --> 17:12.573
is about 120 miles an hour.

17:12.656 --> 17:15.576
But when you go head down
and really start to tighten it up,

17:15.659 --> 17:17.703
you can get some really high speeds.

17:17.786 --> 17:22.291
A lot of people flying head down fly
in the 180, 200 mile an hour range,

17:22.374 --> 17:26.170
but if you really punch it out
and wear something like I'm wearing today,

17:26.253 --> 17:27.963
then I've gotten up to 285 miles an hour.

17:29.048 --> 17:30.257
[Kari laughs]

17:30.841 --> 17:33.218
Two hundred and eighty-five miles
an hour?

17:33.302 --> 17:35.888
What does that do to a body,
going that fast?

17:36.472 --> 17:37.890
[Kyle] It's an interesting experience.

17:37.973 --> 17:41.018
Everything starts to shake
like it's about to fall apart.

17:43.020 --> 17:46.607
-This is kind of a dangerous sport.
-I would say that it's not for beginners.

17:52.946 --> 17:55.866
[Kari] Speed skydiving has a lot in common
with speed skiing.

17:57.951 --> 18:01.455
Gravity is the engine,
wind resistance, the enemy.

18:02.998 --> 18:04.166
Specialized equipment

18:04.249 --> 18:07.127
and an aerodynamic body position
reduce drag.

18:07.211 --> 18:09.213
Like speed skiing, there are rules.

18:09.296 --> 18:15.636
This track is one kilometer long,
but the starting line is 4,000 meters up.

18:15.719 --> 18:19.556
The clock starts
when Kyle hits 2,700 meters.

18:20.057 --> 18:22.810
Right now, it's go time.

18:23.811 --> 18:27.147
Both tech teams have fitted the athletes
with accelerometers...

18:27.231 --> 18:31.110
[Joss over radio] It'll be
about two minutes. Is that okay?

18:31.193 --> 18:34.071
[Kari] and are ready to record
their top speeds and peak acceleration.

18:37.449 --> 18:40.160
The racers are ready
for a rush of raw adrenaline.

18:41.787 --> 18:46.250
So, they start the jump zone
at 13,000 feet.

18:46.333 --> 18:48.210
-Yeah, they're gonna jump around 13.
-Okay.

18:56.718 --> 18:57.928
Cue the data.

19:22.452 --> 19:23.662
They're coming down.

19:49.354 --> 19:50.355
[Joss] Whoo!

19:51.565 --> 19:55.569
[Tory] Joss crosses the timing line
at 106 miles an hour.

19:55.652 --> 19:58.739
Now, he just needs to stop
before hitting our cameraman.

19:59.448 --> 20:02.618
[Kari] Meanwhile,
Kyle has just hit the danger zone,

20:02.701 --> 20:05.329
250 miles per hour and counting.

20:05.412 --> 20:06.288
Wow.

20:07.164 --> 20:09.291
Pull the chute now and he's dead.

20:10.250 --> 20:11.335
He hits the air brakes.

20:17.174 --> 20:21.803
When he slows to 120 miles per hour,
he pops the chute.

20:29.770 --> 20:31.605
You are a beast.

20:31.688 --> 20:34.107
-That was fun.
-You could probably go faster.

20:34.191 --> 20:36.777
What are the limiters?
Is it track, is it equipment?

20:36.860 --> 20:38.987
[Joss] The biggest limiter
would be track size.

20:39.071 --> 20:43.033
There's not a lot of speed skiing tracks
in the world and they're hard to build.

20:43.116 --> 20:46.578
Our biggest limitation at this point
is finding the perfect track.

20:47.287 --> 20:49.164
[Kari] Do you think we've hit the limit

20:49.248 --> 20:52.000
as far as how fast
a non-motorized human can go?

20:52.834 --> 20:54.127
Oh, no, of course not.

20:54.211 --> 20:56.838
Human beings are always searching
for ways to go faster.

20:56.922 --> 20:59.758
There's a lot of things
that we have to do still

20:59.841 --> 21:01.885
in order to improve the equipment.

21:03.095 --> 21:05.764
There's things we can do
to decrease drag on the helmet,

21:05.847 --> 21:10.185
on the risers, just to help
keep little things from slowing us down.

21:11.436 --> 21:13.188
You guys, that was crazy.

21:13.272 --> 21:16.024
The look on the skydiver's face
as he jumped out of the plane.

21:16.108 --> 21:20.195
-Iceman.
-So, what speeds did you finally get?

21:20.279 --> 21:23.740
So, Joss hit a 106 miles per hour.

21:23.824 --> 21:28.078
My guy got up to 260 miles an hour
and he was actually disappointed

21:28.161 --> 21:29.871
because under the optimum conditions,

21:29.955 --> 21:32.833
like, the world record
is 346 miles an hour.

21:33.875 --> 21:38.422
[Tory] Well, the current record
for speed skiing is 158 miles an hour.

21:38.505 --> 21:42.217
[Grant] Okay, well, let's use those
for our top speed criteria.

21:42.301 --> 21:46.138
And we've already seen their scores
for criteria two, acceleration.

21:46.805 --> 21:48.432
How about the third criteria?

21:48.515 --> 21:52.686
How close to the envelope,
the peak of performance, are these guys?

21:52.769 --> 21:56.356
Joss was saying their biggest limiter
is the course itself.

21:56.440 --> 21:59.818
They have to stick to a 1000 meters.
That's not gonna change.

21:59.901 --> 22:01.737
But as far as the aerodynamics go,

22:01.820 --> 22:05.991
they pretty much made their suits
and equipment as efficient as possible.

22:06.074 --> 22:09.703
They're pretty much as close to
as fast as they are gonna ever go.

22:09.786 --> 22:12.456
I mean, the only way to go faster
with speed skydiving

22:12.539 --> 22:14.583
is to lower the drag co-efficient.

22:14.666 --> 22:17.794
Now, being such a young sport,
Kyle is actually really optimistic

22:17.878 --> 22:20.464
that with a little R & D and training
and equipment,

22:20.547 --> 22:22.341
they might be able to go a lot faster.

22:26.970 --> 22:28.430
[Tory] Over 100 years ago,

22:28.513 --> 22:33.018
Walter Baker built a futuristic,
low-slung, electric speed machine.

22:33.101 --> 22:36.438
He designed the first modern
land speed record car.

22:37.064 --> 22:41.943
[Tory] In 1902, it crashed while going
for a new world land speed record.

22:44.112 --> 22:47.324
My mission is
to make the Torpedo live again,

22:47.407 --> 22:50.035
and give Bad Luck Baker another chance.

22:50.118 --> 22:51.119
[laughs]

22:52.287 --> 22:54.456
First, the finishing touches.

22:54.539 --> 22:57.542
Now, when Baker skinned his car,
he used wood and canvas.

22:57.626 --> 22:59.044
We're gonna use the same materials.

22:59.711 --> 23:02.422
What we're gonna do
is take quarter-inch plywood,

23:02.506 --> 23:05.801
cut three-inch wide strips,
and basically bend that over the frame,

23:05.884 --> 23:09.137
and then we're gonna stagger those,
overlapping and nailing as we go.

23:13.600 --> 23:16.186
Once we have our basic shape,
then what we're gonna do

23:16.269 --> 23:19.231
is spray it with expanding foam
just to smooth it out.

23:19.314 --> 23:22.442
After sanding, we'll cover it with canvas
and treat it with oil.

23:22.526 --> 23:24.611
Once the oil is dry,
we'll give it a paint job.

23:27.030 --> 23:29.533
When this thing's done,
it's gonna look so badass.

23:35.122 --> 23:39.042
Now to add some ballast
so it weighs the same as the original car.

23:39.126 --> 23:42.546
Once I put the body on and I climb in,
we'll be at 3000 pounds.

23:42.629 --> 23:44.881
Now, as far as the power
of the vehicle goes,

23:44.965 --> 23:48.635
we have used the same type of batteries
that Baker used,

23:48.718 --> 23:50.720
and we have taken a motor
and dialed it back

23:50.804 --> 23:52.681
to a motor rated at seven horsepower.

23:52.764 --> 23:56.893
Now, for the final element,
we're gonna add the body.

24:04.109 --> 24:09.072
All right, this is it,
the last piece to the puzzle.

24:09.906 --> 24:11.032
And it looks sick.

24:11.116 --> 24:14.327
I mean,
it looks just like Baker's Torpedo Car.

24:16.037 --> 24:18.748
Now it's time to turn this thing around
and go for a run.

24:18.832 --> 24:19.833
[laughs]

24:20.500 --> 24:21.626
I can't wait.

24:21.710 --> 24:23.044
Hope I don't crash like Baker did.

24:30.886 --> 24:31.970
This is it.

24:34.055 --> 24:38.810
Can our tribute to the Torpedo
break the 1902 world record?

24:40.729 --> 24:43.148
We're about to roll out.

24:43.648 --> 24:44.858
This is for you, Baker.

24:46.109 --> 24:50.739
We're trying to hit 75 miles an hour.
Here we go in three, two, one.

25:02.542 --> 25:04.753
Thirty miles per hour.

25:06.504 --> 25:08.673
The acceleration is insane.

25:11.718 --> 25:14.596
Fifty. Sixty.

25:17.390 --> 25:18.391
And...

25:21.186 --> 25:22.354
Seventy-six!

25:22.437 --> 25:24.856
Yes! We've done it.

25:34.699 --> 25:37.327
Holy shit, the brakes don't work!

25:41.289 --> 25:43.708
[Grant] Battery-powered speed comes
in all sizes.

25:44.209 --> 25:47.045
Welcome to the world
of remote control drag racing.

25:48.171 --> 25:49.756
This is Tim Smith.

25:49.839 --> 25:55.345
Bona fide speed freak with a personal best
of 179 miles per hour.

25:55.428 --> 26:00.558
His mission, smash the current
world record of 202 miles per hour.

26:00.642 --> 26:02.477
And it all starts here...

26:03.645 --> 26:04.688
in his garage.

26:04.771 --> 26:07.983
Let's cut.
How can you go wrong, right? [laughs]

26:08.066 --> 26:11.486
[Grant] Where we're gonna try to squeeze
a few more miles per hour out of his car.

26:12.487 --> 26:14.364
Starting with the aerodynamics.

26:14.447 --> 26:16.533
All right,
I'm gonna coat down the body

26:16.616 --> 26:19.119
so the cloth will stick to it
a little bit better.

26:19.202 --> 26:23.039
[Grant] Today we're gonna make
a brand-new carbon fiber body

26:23.123 --> 26:27.752
because at this level of performance,
it's not giant leap after giant leap.

26:27.836 --> 26:30.964
It's a series of small,
incremental improvements.

26:31.047 --> 26:34.217
Okay, that seems like it's probably
enough resin for the body,

26:34.301 --> 26:35.260
so let's wrap it.

26:35.844 --> 26:39.097
[Grant] With the carbon fiber molded,
he pulls a vacuum to make sure

26:39.180 --> 26:43.226
he has a uniform shell
and a super-slick, lightweight surface.

26:43.310 --> 26:45.312
It's gonna be as smooth
as what we see right now.

26:45.395 --> 26:46.980
What we see
is what we're gonna end up with.

26:47.063 --> 26:48.732
Okay, so...

26:48.815 --> 26:50.525
[Grant] While the carbon fiber cures,

26:50.609 --> 26:53.153
Tim gives me a tour
of the hardware under the hood.

26:54.154 --> 26:56.948
-I see a brushless motor.
-Right.

26:57.032 --> 27:00.618
If I ran this motor on one volt,
I'd have 2400 rpm out of this motor.

27:00.702 --> 27:02.871
We're gonna run it on 33 volts.

27:02.954 --> 27:05.040
So, we're gonna get about
70,000 out of this motor.

27:05.123 --> 27:06.249
Wow. That's fast.

27:06.333 --> 27:07.751
To put that in context,

27:07.834 --> 27:12.631
the latest model Teslas redline
at around 16,000 to 18,000 RPM.

27:12.714 --> 27:15.467
All right, let's talk about
the source of your power.

27:15.550 --> 27:20.305
[Tim] Okay, these are four-cells packs,
and this is 14.8 volts each battery.

27:20.388 --> 27:25.894
[Grant] Tim's got the parts, the ambition
and his homemade carbon fiber body.

27:25.977 --> 27:28.855
-There it is.
-Oh, God. That's great.

27:29.397 --> 27:31.566
But to give him a better shot
at the title,

27:31.650 --> 27:33.818
I've got a friend who owes me a favor.

27:35.320 --> 27:38.031
This is San Diego State University,

27:38.114 --> 27:40.450
and Tim is about to step up
to the big leagues.

27:40.950 --> 27:42.786
-Hey, Len.
-Hey, Grant.

27:42.869 --> 27:43.870
-How's it going?
-Good.

27:43.953 --> 27:44.788
-Hey, Tim.
-Hi.

27:46.039 --> 27:47.916
[Grant] Wind tunnel testing
is a crucial component

27:47.999 --> 27:50.377
of high-performance aerodynamic design.

27:50.877 --> 27:55.215
Red alert, set course bearing 125,
shields at maximum.

27:56.424 --> 27:57.801
First, we need a baseline.

27:58.468 --> 28:01.554
So, we measure the drag produced
by an off-the-shelf model.

28:04.682 --> 28:07.560
You hear that?
That's the sound of science.

28:07.644 --> 28:08.520
[laughs]

28:09.687 --> 28:13.525
And then we compare it
to Tim's carbon fiber shell.

28:13.608 --> 28:18.029
[Len] What that provided was about
a 1.4% improvement in drag.

28:18.113 --> 28:21.741
[Grant] It's a start, but Tim needs
to reduce his drag significantly

28:21.825 --> 28:23.576
to beat the world record.

28:23.660 --> 28:26.538
So, this is gonna give us a nice view
of what's happening

28:26.621 --> 28:28.915
to the flow at very localized areas.

28:31.000 --> 28:32.544
Oh, yeah. [laughs]

28:32.627 --> 28:33.503
There you go.

28:34.170 --> 28:37.674
[Grant] Where the strings are stable,
the aerodynamic flow is efficient.

28:37.757 --> 28:39.926
But when they flap around chaotically...

28:40.009 --> 28:42.512
[Len] Behind the front wheel,
it's pretty ugly.

28:43.096 --> 28:45.557
[Grant] that indicates
velocity-reducing drag.

28:45.640 --> 28:48.393
But don't worry, the doc has a solution.

28:48.476 --> 28:50.562
[Len] Well,
we've got these little critters

28:50.645 --> 28:51.896
called vortex generators

28:51.980 --> 28:57.110
and they will cause the flow to stir
and mix and reduce your pressure drag.

28:57.193 --> 29:00.530
[Grant] So, what this does is it makes
the transition a little smoother.

29:00.613 --> 29:03.366
Smoother, less of a low-pressure area.

29:03.450 --> 29:05.368
Less pressure drag, faster speed.

29:07.245 --> 29:08.455
[Grant] Test two.

29:10.331 --> 29:13.293
And right away,
the airflow looks a lot smoother.

29:13.376 --> 29:17.213
[Len] Now, in comparison,
we reduced the drag by 9%.

29:17.297 --> 29:18.631
-[Tim] Wow.
-[Grant] That's awesome.

29:19.215 --> 29:21.134
It's a big step up from test one.

29:21.634 --> 29:26.514
Okay, so let's say we wanna eke out
as much performance as we possibly can.

29:26.598 --> 29:28.975
Do you have any final suggestions?

29:29.058 --> 29:33.605
One would be to fair this area
in here so they're covered.

29:33.688 --> 29:36.024
The other is probably
to extend the cowling,

29:36.107 --> 29:39.444
and just see if you can cover up
some of the rear wheels here.

29:39.527 --> 29:43.615
Okay, Tim, we've still got a couple days
before the world record attempt.

29:43.698 --> 29:44.991
Do you think you're gonna be ready?

29:45.074 --> 29:46.785
I think I can.
Especially with all this news.

29:46.868 --> 29:49.704
I can make these changes,
and it should make this car better.

29:49.788 --> 29:51.915
-All right, thanks a lot.
-Great day, guys.

29:52.999 --> 29:55.043
[Kari] While Grant's chasing speed
at ground level,

29:55.126 --> 29:55.960
I'm aiming higher,

29:56.044 --> 30:00.006
and my next contender could be on top
when it comes to our final rankings.

30:06.471 --> 30:08.890
If you're looking for speed,
you wanna take to the skies.

30:09.682 --> 30:11.935
I've chosen a jet.

30:17.398 --> 30:19.651
But if you wanna find
the fastest plane of all,

30:20.777 --> 30:25.907
you have to go all the way back to 1958
and the height of the Cold War.

30:30.787 --> 30:33.706
The world is on the brink
of nuclear apocalypse.

30:38.628 --> 30:41.256
The CIA wants a futuristic new spy plane

30:41.339 --> 30:45.385
that can fly faster than any plane
ever has done before.

30:47.971 --> 30:50.723
Twenty-two hundred miles per hour.

30:50.807 --> 30:52.767
Three times the speed of sound.

30:53.810 --> 30:58.189
But what they're proposing is a plane
that not just flies at Mach 3,

30:58.273 --> 31:00.733
but cruises at Mach 3.

31:00.817 --> 31:04.487
At an altitude of 85,000 feet.

31:07.782 --> 31:11.578
The only place that would even dream
of an aircraft like this

31:11.661 --> 31:14.205
is Lockheed Martin's R & D workshop,
Skunk Works.

31:15.582 --> 31:19.252
They're the guys who invented
the legendary spy plane, the U2.

31:22.297 --> 31:24.674
Heading up this engineering A-team

31:24.757 --> 31:27.594
is aviation genius
Clarence "Kelly" Johnson.

31:29.429 --> 31:32.515
The project is classified black,
above top secret.

31:33.516 --> 31:36.144
The plane is christened the SR-71.

31:39.105 --> 31:43.985
Building the SR-71 is the greatest
engineering challenge in aviation history.

31:44.944 --> 31:47.780
The 500-degree heat
generated at cruising speed

31:47.864 --> 31:50.199
means the cockpit windshield
will melt lead.

31:51.284 --> 31:54.495
Tests show that, at Mach 3,
the plane expands several inches

31:54.579 --> 31:56.664
as it heats up
under extreme temperatures.

31:57.248 --> 31:59.542
Everything must be built from scratch.

32:02.253 --> 32:08.509
They build the windshield from quartz,
hydraulic lines from stainless steel,

32:09.886 --> 32:13.556
the ejector flaps from an alloy used
in watch springs,

32:15.224 --> 32:17.435
and gold-plate the plumbing lines.

32:18.645 --> 32:22.774
Due to its high melting point,
they craft the body out of titanium,

32:22.857 --> 32:26.110
which, at the time,
was mostly mined in Russia.

32:26.194 --> 32:29.989
So, the CIA used front companies
to buy all the supplies from the enemy.

32:31.491 --> 32:34.410
But the biggest challenge
is the propulsion system.

32:36.412 --> 32:39.415
The most powerful jet engines in the world
only produce speeds of Mach 2.

32:41.250 --> 32:44.754
So, how do you get a plane
to cruise at Mach 3?

32:46.464 --> 32:50.843
The answer, engineering genius
in the shape of air throttles,

32:50.927 --> 32:54.389
movable cones that control the airflow
into the engines.

32:55.723 --> 32:59.686
The cones produce an amazing 70%
of the plane's total thrust,

32:59.769 --> 33:03.648
allowing the SR-71 to fly at two-thirds
of a mile per second.

33:07.860 --> 33:09.529
April 1962.

33:12.323 --> 33:17.120
It's time to test this speed machine,
nicknamed Blackbird.

33:21.290 --> 33:23.960
[pilot speaking indistinctly over radio]

33:27.005 --> 33:30.299
[Kari] The plane accelerates
with the roar of a tornado.

33:33.511 --> 33:37.390
Peaking at 19.4 feet per second squared...

33:38.766 --> 33:43.021
it can accelerate for longer
than any other vehicle at maximum power.

33:43.604 --> 33:47.984
Twenty minutes after takeoff,
it hits Mach 3.2.

33:51.487 --> 33:54.949
The SR-71 flies coast to coast
across America

33:55.033 --> 33:57.410
in one hour and seven minutes.

33:57.493 --> 34:00.163
It can go from day to night
in a split second

34:00.246 --> 34:04.125
and outfly the rotation of the Earth.

34:04.625 --> 34:08.421
It conducts 3,500 missions
over hostile territory,

34:08.504 --> 34:11.257
evading 1,000 missiles just
by hitting the throttle.

34:17.013 --> 34:23.478
In 1990, the SR-71 Blackbird was retired
after 65 million miles of flying,

34:25.229 --> 34:28.858
and it's the only military aircraft
to never have been shot down

34:28.941 --> 34:31.569
or ever lose a crew member
to enemy fire.

34:31.652 --> 34:36.824
It shattered every aviation record
as the first supersonic stealth aircraft,

34:36.908 --> 34:40.745
and to this day,
it's still the fastest plane ever created.

34:41.329 --> 34:42.622
[Tory] Wow. That's impressive.

34:42.705 --> 34:44.791
Criteria number one,
how fast did it go?

34:45.374 --> 34:49.837
Well, the SR-71 had a top speed
of Mach 3.2,

34:49.921 --> 34:52.465
-and that is a 50-year-old plane.
-Wow. That's amazing.

34:52.548 --> 34:55.551
[Kari] Yeah, for top speed,
this is an extraordinary aircraft

34:55.635 --> 34:58.638
but as for acceleration,
it takes off relatively slow

34:58.721 --> 35:00.473
at 20 feet per second squared,

35:00.556 --> 35:03.309
compared to Usain Bolt
who accelerates at 30.

35:03.392 --> 35:05.394
All right, criteria number three,

35:05.478 --> 35:08.231
how close to the speed limit is it
in its category?

35:08.314 --> 35:11.984
This is as fast as it gets
because the military really shifted focus

35:12.068 --> 35:13.444
to stealth technology.

35:13.528 --> 35:15.613
They stopped making planes
to outrun missiles

35:15.696 --> 35:17.406
and started making planes
that were invisible to radar.

35:17.490 --> 35:19.367
So, speed became irrelevant?

35:19.450 --> 35:22.495
I feel like the SR-71 is pretty close
to the limit.

35:22.578 --> 35:25.665
Maybe like almost 100% in its class.

35:37.176 --> 35:39.137
[Grant] We've come here today
to try and break

35:39.220 --> 35:41.389
the RC car world speed record.

35:42.140 --> 35:45.351
We're here on the taxiway
at the St. George Municipal Airport.

35:45.434 --> 35:49.272
When you're trying to break world records,
you want ideal conditions.

35:49.355 --> 35:52.817
And that's what we have here.
First of all, the taxiway.

35:52.900 --> 35:57.738
It's over a 9,000 feet of incredibly flat,
incredibly straight road.

35:57.822 --> 35:59.782
Secondly, the altitude.

35:59.866 --> 36:04.662
Nearly 3,000 feet above sea level
means less air resistance,

36:04.745 --> 36:08.332
which means faster runs with less energy.

36:08.833 --> 36:09.792
Today's the day.

36:10.376 --> 36:11.711
I think we're ready.
We've got a new car.

36:12.420 --> 36:15.298
[Grant] He's checked off
all the drag doctor's suggestions,

36:15.381 --> 36:18.759
but he's added a radical
last-minute idea of his own.

36:18.843 --> 36:22.889
I've actually eliminated one of the wheels
and created a center steering type car

36:22.972 --> 36:24.765
where this wheel sits right
in the middle of the car.

36:25.349 --> 36:28.352
[Grant] Reinventing the wheel
is a risky call on a big day.

36:28.853 --> 36:32.815
With a judge from Guinness World Records
here to adjudicate,

36:32.899 --> 36:34.233
I've got my fingers crossed.

36:35.151 --> 36:37.403
We also have a third-party witness

36:37.486 --> 36:41.741
in the form of a local police officer
here from St. George, Utah.

36:43.117 --> 36:47.580
And our measurement system consists
of a dual-beam laser timing unit

36:47.663 --> 36:51.167
that precisely measures the time interval
between breaking one beam

36:51.250 --> 36:52.835
to breaking the second beam.

36:52.919 --> 36:53.878
[Tim] Started.

36:56.589 --> 36:57.506
Stop.

36:57.590 --> 36:58.883
[Grant] Two hundred?

36:58.966 --> 37:00.426
3.39 miles an hour.

37:00.509 --> 37:01.344
Yes.

37:01.427 --> 37:02.929
New personal best.

37:04.805 --> 37:08.809
Tim is grooming the track,
trying to remove any debris he might find.

37:09.435 --> 37:14.398
Because when your tires are only this big,
even hitting a tiny rock like this

37:15.858 --> 37:19.695
would be like a rock like this
hitting a regular-sized tire.

37:19.779 --> 37:21.572
His car would go careening out
of control.

37:23.157 --> 37:25.284
And to add the finishing touch,

37:25.368 --> 37:29.038
his high-tech proprietary
super-sticky solution,

37:29.538 --> 37:31.374
which I'm pretty sure is sugar water.

37:31.457 --> 37:34.961
Tim claims it provides better traction.

37:35.044 --> 37:38.923
We'll see about that.
So, we're ready to go.

37:39.757 --> 37:42.009
Tim has put in hundreds of hours

37:42.093 --> 37:45.263
redesigning his steering system
to reduce drag.

37:45.346 --> 37:47.390
Cameras are ready and standing by.

37:47.473 --> 37:49.016
For him to break the record,

37:49.100 --> 37:51.769
a hundred things have to go right
all at once.

37:51.852 --> 37:53.521
Track is clear. Here we go.

37:53.604 --> 37:56.440
For him to fail,
only one of them has to go wrong.

38:01.445 --> 38:02.363
Let's go.

38:16.711 --> 38:17.795
It blew a tire.

38:20.464 --> 38:23.217
-[Grant over radio] Copy that.
-[Grant] All right, take two.

38:26.971 --> 38:28.764
[Grant] Looking good, looking good.

38:35.479 --> 38:37.565
132.26.

38:38.357 --> 38:42.862
Like they always say, world records
are 99% perseverance.

38:42.945 --> 38:45.114
[Tim] It looks like the wheels
blew apart again.

38:45.197 --> 38:47.825
-[Grant] It shredded them.
-1% glory.

38:47.908 --> 38:50.286
[Tim laughs] It's only about 200 under.

38:51.120 --> 38:53.039
[Grant] They weren't kidding
about the perseverance part.

38:56.667 --> 38:59.086
[Tim] I think we blew
the bearings apart again.

38:59.170 --> 39:01.464
[Tim] Oh, shit, no, no, don't.

39:02.048 --> 39:03.007
[groans]

39:03.382 --> 39:07.303
[Grant] Apparently,
records aren't that easy to break.

39:11.140 --> 39:12.016
Ow!

39:13.351 --> 39:14.185
Ow.

39:15.770 --> 39:16.604
Uh...

39:19.565 --> 39:20.733
-[Grant sighs]
-All right.

39:21.609 --> 39:24.362
But speed freaks never say die.

39:24.904 --> 39:28.532
Like the heroic pioneers who blazed
their way into the history books

39:28.616 --> 39:30.451
on the Bonneville Salt Flats...

39:30.534 --> 39:31.410
[man] He's out of control.

39:32.203 --> 39:35.414
[Grant] giving up just isn't a part
of Tim's vocabulary.

39:35.915 --> 39:40.753
Which means before long,
I find myself back on yet another runway,

39:40.836 --> 39:43.839
with yet another official
from Guinness World Records,

39:43.923 --> 39:46.008
and yet another wheel design.

39:46.092 --> 39:47.301
It's a plastic rim.

39:47.385 --> 39:49.929
It's a little different
than the tire you saw before.

39:50.012 --> 39:52.223
It's actually a full ounce
and a half lighter.

39:52.306 --> 39:54.475
I feel great.
The car seems to be working well,

39:54.558 --> 39:57.228
it goes straight, it has a lot of power.
Let's see if we can do it.

39:57.311 --> 39:58.479
All right, let's do it.

40:00.231 --> 40:02.733
All right, people,
world record attempt here.

40:02.817 --> 40:04.360
This is it.

40:05.361 --> 40:06.529
It better be.

40:11.534 --> 40:14.370
Bring it back in bring it back in. Yes.

40:14.453 --> 40:17.832
World record glory?
Or just another failed attempt?

40:17.915 --> 40:21.877
We have 82.39 miles per hour.

40:21.961 --> 40:26.924
That's 120 miles an hour short
of the world record, and it gets worse...

40:29.635 --> 40:32.054
before it gets marginally better.

40:32.638 --> 40:34.140
Oh! [laughs]

40:34.557 --> 40:38.310
170.67. We're a little short.

40:38.394 --> 40:41.564
But, unfortunately,
that's as good as it gets.

40:41.647 --> 40:43.274
Despite taking Tim

40:43.357 --> 40:45.359
to the top wind tunnel guys
in the country,

40:45.484 --> 40:48.070
tweaking and tinkering
for weeks on end,

40:48.154 --> 40:50.739
and annoying
the Guinness World Records guys,

40:50.823 --> 40:53.492
we didn't match Tim's previous best.

40:54.660 --> 40:56.829
So, how are we scoring this one?
Top Speed?

40:56.912 --> 40:59.957
The current world record
is 202 miles per hour.

41:01.459 --> 41:05.463
Acceleration? We topped out
at 18 feet per second per second.

41:06.714 --> 41:10.634
And proximity to speed limit?
As battery technology improves,

41:10.718 --> 41:14.680
these things will go significantly faster,
so 7 out of 10.

41:14.763 --> 41:16.474
Tim, a tough day out here today.

41:16.557 --> 41:18.726
It has been a difficult day,
to say the least.

41:18.809 --> 41:21.937
So many things have to go
perfectly right for that to happen

41:22.021 --> 41:24.398
and we had a couple of little things
that seemed to fight us all day long.

41:24.482 --> 41:26.692
We came here to break a record.

41:26.775 --> 41:28.652
-We did.
-We're gonna break a record.

41:28.736 --> 41:33.782
I have a way to accelerate this car
faster than any RC vehicle in history.

41:33.866 --> 41:37.286
In three, two, one.

41:40.247 --> 41:45.127
Yep, use a little explosive and the car,
or parts of it anyway,

41:45.211 --> 41:47.922
hit 1200 miles per hour.

41:48.005 --> 41:49.798
[Grant laughing]

41:50.799 --> 41:53.177
It never gets old. It really doesn't.

41:58.933 --> 42:01.810
[Tory] In pursuit of the 1902
land speed record,

42:01.894 --> 42:04.146
I've just broken
the 75-mile an hour barrier

42:04.230 --> 42:06.023
that eluded Bad Luck Baker.

42:06.524 --> 42:08.526
Seventy-six. Yes.

42:08.609 --> 42:10.236
We've done it.

42:10.319 --> 42:12.988
Now, it looks like his
bad luck's rubbed off on me.

42:13.072 --> 42:15.074
Holy shit, the brakes don't work.

42:21.455 --> 42:22.873
That was scary.

42:24.833 --> 42:27.753
-[man] Are you okay there, Tory?
-Yeah, brakes failed.

42:29.964 --> 42:34.552
I think the good news is, one,
we broke the record, two, I didn't crash.

42:34.635 --> 42:39.598
Baker crashed, and he didn't break
the record, so we're two for two here.

42:41.308 --> 42:44.895
Let's jump forward
to today's custom electric car.

42:44.979 --> 42:46.814
To see how far Baker's
dream has come.

42:47.565 --> 42:48.983
[tires screech]

42:49.066 --> 42:50.818
Meet the Zombie.

42:52.319 --> 42:54.572
Silent and unrivaled.

42:58.534 --> 43:02.204
Normally, when I look at a Mustang,
I think about the roaring engine,

43:02.288 --> 43:04.915
and when you drove in here,
it was silent.

43:04.999 --> 43:07.876
When we started looking for customers
early on,

43:07.960 --> 43:09.420
to go do this for other people,

43:09.503 --> 43:12.089
that was the number one objection
that came up,

43:12.172 --> 43:14.925
was, "I'm gonna miss the sound
of my V8 in my muscle car."

43:15.509 --> 43:19.430
And what we found real quick
was we just had to give them a ride.

43:21.557 --> 43:24.018
Yeah! [chuckles]

43:24.101 --> 43:26.937
-[Mitch] Once they got in the car,
-[chuckling]

43:27.021 --> 43:29.982
and we took them for a ride,
it all changed.

43:31.066 --> 43:33.027
That is some serious torque.

43:33.110 --> 43:36.238
-That was 140.
-140 miles an hour.

43:37.114 --> 43:42.036
[Mitch] Because the silence actually makes
the whole thing more exhilarating.

43:42.119 --> 43:44.663
It's like instant torque.
Instant power.

43:44.747 --> 43:46.582
-Ready?
-Yeah.

43:47.958 --> 43:49.168
[laughs]

43:49.752 --> 43:52.588
[Mitch] It makes it feel surreal,
like you're in a rocket.

43:52.671 --> 43:54.882
When I take it
and I throw the hammer down...

43:57.843 --> 44:02.389
and unleash almost 4,000 amps through
each of these motors at 222 volts...

44:02.473 --> 44:04.892
What did you think of that?

44:04.975 --> 44:06.226
It's like...

44:06.852 --> 44:09.938
[Tory] That was insane.

44:10.439 --> 44:13.817
There is nothing dead
about the Zombie.

44:13.901 --> 44:18.280
All right so this is the fastest custom
electric street-legal car out there today?

44:18.364 --> 44:21.617
-Quickest and fastest.
-What's the top speed you've done in it?

44:21.700 --> 44:24.912
177.8 miles an hour in one mile.

44:24.995 --> 44:26.705
How about off the line,
what's the acceleration?

44:26.789 --> 44:30.542
-Zero to 60 in 1.79 seconds.
-That is insane.

44:30.626 --> 44:32.461
All right, so a hundred years ago,

44:32.544 --> 44:35.839
the Torpedo car
was the fastest car around.

44:35.923 --> 44:40.469
And now, a hundred years later,
this is the fastest car.

44:40.552 --> 44:42.513
What are we gonna see
100 years from now?

44:42.596 --> 44:44.848
There is nothing that says

44:44.932 --> 44:47.935
if battery technology
goes through a major revolution,

44:48.018 --> 44:50.354
that there isn't anything the electric

44:50.437 --> 44:52.856
should not be able to do
that's being done today by cars.

44:52.940 --> 44:55.109
So, 300 miles an hour
in one mile.

44:55.192 --> 44:57.444
It's gonna happen. All that has to do
is get the batteries there.

44:57.528 --> 44:59.488
Yes. I can't wait for that day.

44:59.571 --> 45:02.074
-Let's enjoy what we've got right now.
-Yeah, let's do it.

45:02.157 --> 45:03.158
Uh, can I drive?

45:08.288 --> 45:11.708
Dude, that was so crazy.
How was it driving the Torpedo?

45:11.792 --> 45:14.253
It was a little sketchy
because it is a prototype.

45:14.336 --> 45:16.171
That's not the top speed
I am gonna go with.

45:16.255 --> 45:18.799
I am gonna use the speed from
the Zombie,

45:18.882 --> 45:22.594
which is the current record holder
for custom street-legal electric cars.

45:22.678 --> 45:24.430
178 miles per hour.

45:25.013 --> 45:27.516
Let's see where that ranks
with the rest of our contenders.

45:27.599 --> 45:30.602
We've looked at a diverse range
of speed freaks,

45:30.686 --> 45:33.730
from skydivers and skiers to RC cars.

45:33.814 --> 45:35.232
[Tory] Yes, we've done it.

45:35.315 --> 45:38.610
[Kari] Now, let's average up
how they performed in our three criteria.

45:39.236 --> 45:44.783
One, top speed. Two, acceleration.
And three, proximity to speed limit.

45:44.867 --> 45:46.869
Have they reached their peak?

45:47.828 --> 45:51.749
To find out which contender
is the freakiest speedster of them all.

45:51.832 --> 45:54.835
At number six: RC Car.

45:54.918 --> 45:57.963
Came an impressive third
in the pure speed rankings

45:58.046 --> 46:00.382
but lost points for slow acceleration.

46:00.466 --> 46:04.428
Number five: Speed Skiing.

46:04.511 --> 46:07.806
158 miles per hour without an airbag.

46:08.557 --> 46:10.058
That's insane.

46:11.143 --> 46:12.770
At four: Fastest Human.

46:14.897 --> 46:16.982
Low top speed was no surprise,

46:17.065 --> 46:20.944
but astonishingly Bolt came second
in acceleration stakes.

46:21.028 --> 46:26.992
At third overall, Custom Electric Car had
top acceleration of all our contenders,

46:27.075 --> 46:31.079
but these machines are still a long way
away from their top speed potential.

46:31.163 --> 46:33.499
At number two: Speed Skydiving.

46:33.582 --> 46:37.544
A high achiever in both
top speed and acceleration.

46:37.628 --> 46:39.213
Gravity rules.

46:39.713 --> 46:44.092
And the number one Speed Freak
is the SR-71.

46:44.176 --> 46:45.803
An earsplitting Mach 3,

46:45.886 --> 46:49.681
and there's little chance
any manned jet will ever go faster.

46:51.558 --> 46:55.062
And that is how our six speed freaks
stacked up.

46:55.562 --> 46:57.523
I told you I had a jet.

46:57.606 --> 47:01.902
Even though I knew Bolt
wasn't gonna beat anybody for speed,

47:01.985 --> 47:05.239
still I think he gets some credit
for having a higher acceleration

47:05.322 --> 47:07.074
than most of the guys on the list.

47:07.157 --> 47:09.993
Yeah, but I have a jet.

47:10.077 --> 47:12.246
-Yes, we know.
-We know.
