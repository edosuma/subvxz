[Johnnie Keyes] <i>I helped change
the sexual mores of this country,</i>

00:21.341 --> 00:24.643
<i>and made it legal
for human beings</i>

00:24.645 --> 00:31.215
<i>to go to a store and rent
a X-Rated movie legally.</i>

00:31.217 --> 00:35.521
<i>And I helped make that thing
a reality in this country.</i>

00:35.523 --> 00:39.190
So, I freed a lot of dicks and pussies.
That's how I feel about it,

00:39.192 --> 00:42.528
you know what I mean, real talk.
[laughs] That's some real talk.

01:56.270 --> 01:59.773
When I first got into the industry, I
was waiting tables for seven years.

01:59.775 --> 02:01.841
And I was in college.
I was a broke-college student.

02:01.843 --> 02:06.412
I used to sell in market timeshare,
and I really just hated my job.

02:06.414 --> 02:11.685
And I actually have job satisfaction now.
So, even on the days that it's bad,

02:11.687 --> 02:15.989
I just remind myself how much I love my work,
and the next day is going to be better.

02:15.991 --> 02:18.858
She was like: "Please, please, do the scene.
I was like: "I'm not doing a fucking porn.

02:18.860 --> 02:21.428
Now, get the fuck outa here." And they
were like: "Lo, we'll give you basically

02:21.430 --> 02:24.564
three times what you make at
your regular job for 45 minutes

02:24.566 --> 02:26.933
of doing what you did
at home for free an hour ago."

02:26.935 --> 02:29.469
I was like:
"Okay. Let's do that."

02:29.471 --> 02:32.472
He was my first scene
in the business in 2006.

02:32.474 --> 02:35.675
- Did not go well... at all.
- Did not go well... at all.

02:35.677 --> 02:38.878
It was so bad, I didn't want to work with
her for like three years after that.

02:38.880 --> 02:42.348
- But three years later, he worked with me.
- And then it went well.

02:42.350 --> 02:44.484
- And it went well.
- And now we're married.

02:44.486 --> 02:46.888
[piano music]

03:11.881 --> 03:14.249
[Priya] <i>I was treated
a little differently.</i>

03:17.987 --> 03:21.387
[battle cry]

03:21.389 --> 03:25.358
I think that actually got harder
when I was more like in junior high

03:25.360 --> 03:27.596
and kids started
picking on me. And like...

03:29.331 --> 03:30.700
I would get jumped.

03:31.934 --> 03:34.769
I got held down,
my hair cut off.

03:34.771 --> 03:37.537
[battle cry]

03:37.539 --> 03:41.876
I was pretty. I was a pretty little girl.
And so girls were very mean to me.

03:41.878 --> 03:45.946
Little things like that would happen
to me all throughout my teen years.

03:45.948 --> 03:47.815
[battle cry]

03:47.817 --> 03:49.819
[sinister music]

04:02.498 --> 04:08.035
[Priya] I cannot be tamed. You know,
wild child is being an extraordinaire,

04:08.037 --> 04:10.938
being not the norm.

04:10.940 --> 04:12.840
[heavy breathing]

04:12.842 --> 04:15.311
Like I just loved being free.

04:25.955 --> 04:28.956
[Priya] And I'd say, like there's your
conservatives and then your exhibitionist.

04:28.958 --> 04:32.793
Two different types of personalities.
Not one is better than the other.

04:32.795 --> 04:35.130
They're just different.
Society tries to tell you

04:35.132 --> 04:37.067
one is better than the other,
but they're not.

04:41.938 --> 04:44.505
[presenter] <i>Remember guys, when you're
throwing money during the fights,</i>

04:44.507 --> 04:46.507
<i>give it on the outside
of the cage.</i>

04:46.509 --> 04:48.845
<i>I don't wanna have to teach
you all how to make it rain.</i>

05:00.057 --> 05:03.624
[Priya] I'm actually really super
excited for this particular fight.

05:03.626 --> 05:06.094
This is very new to me. I
don't know. It's just something

05:06.096 --> 05:09.697
I wanted to tap into, have a
lot of fun and be a little sexy.

05:09.699 --> 05:13.201
And I was like:
"Shit. Let's do it." [laughs]

05:13.203 --> 05:15.739
[sinister music]

05:34.091 --> 05:36.457
Okay. So where
was I before that.

05:36.459 --> 05:40.595
I was born in New Delhi. I came to
America when I was eight months old.

05:40.597 --> 05:44.699
I was adopted
by a very religious family.

05:44.701 --> 05:48.703
They adopted four of us and they
had three of their own, so...

05:48.705 --> 05:51.673
Theirs they're older, they're
really involved in the church,

05:51.675 --> 05:56.546
so they're not really aware of the
extent of what I do and who I am.

05:58.715 --> 06:01.116
Yeah, I think she has had this
idea that we were going to come.

06:01.118 --> 06:03.785
We are going to be, you know,
good Indian little kids.

06:03.787 --> 06:07.222
We were gonna go to school like a normal
Indian kid that comes from India.

06:07.224 --> 06:11.660
I remember my mom looking at my brother and I,
and she goes, she looked at my brother and goes:

06:11.662 --> 06:16.965
"You were supposed to be my engineer." Then
she was: "You were supposed to be my doctor."

06:16.967 --> 06:21.102
And uhm, I just go on
with doctor of love. [laughs]

06:21.104 --> 06:22.639
She didn't like that too much.

06:30.681 --> 06:35.519
Everything seems okay.
Oooh.

06:39.057 --> 06:41.923
So, at 15 I'm pregnant, '93.

06:41.925 --> 06:44.859
I remember
they had pregnant schools.

06:44.861 --> 06:49.564
And they would ship all the
pregnant girls to this one school.

06:49.566 --> 06:52.101
We'd all come in on buses
and we would go to school there

06:52.103 --> 06:55.304
until we get our kids and then
we go back to school, so...

06:55.306 --> 06:57.974
Definitely, a different world
than it is now.

06:57.976 --> 07:00.610
I look back, but... I did it.

07:02.113 --> 07:05.748
It was kind of forced upon me
to grow up really fast.

07:05.750 --> 07:08.616
So, I went from being 15
to a parent.

07:08.618 --> 07:13.588
You're ready?
Alright. Hands up.

07:13.590 --> 07:18.227
And so, it's rough, you know, trying
to work and be a single parent.

07:18.229 --> 07:24.934
I remember when I was looking at ads.
I was like, "Topless dancers."

07:24.936 --> 07:27.136
All right. I'm gonna
go try this out, so...

07:27.138 --> 07:30.072
[host] Priya Rai, she's is at
Cheerleaders in the strip district

07:30.074 --> 07:32.742
- and you're gonna be here for two shows tonight,
- Yes.

07:32.744 --> 07:35.111
- and two shows tomorrow?
- Yes!

07:35.113 --> 07:37.747
[Priya] Stripping for me, you know, you
don't know what you're going come in there

07:37.749 --> 07:40.816
and make in the hustle. I was just, you
know, being the little wild child at work.

07:40.818 --> 07:42.818
I would be partying
instead of working.

07:42.820 --> 07:45.221
And then like, I just remember
the girls in the back,

07:45.223 --> 07:47.323
I'd be rolling around on the floor.
They would like: "Girl, why don't you

07:47.325 --> 07:50.026
just become a porn star. What
the hell, doing your asshole

07:50.028 --> 07:52.995
up in the air just like,
you know, it's just crazy."

07:52.997 --> 07:56.999
And so I was like: "You know what? One day,
I thought about it." I was like: "Why not?"

07:57.001 --> 08:02.305
So, I lived in Phoenix, Arizona. I
was in the circle of Jenna Jameson.

08:02.307 --> 08:05.174
So, I would go to all the parties
and I would talk to people.

08:05.176 --> 08:07.610
And I remember I was in the pool
talking to this guy.

08:07.612 --> 08:09.979
I was like: "I want to be an actress
and thought about doing..."

08:09.981 --> 08:12.815
He's like: "Honey, you don't
look like an actress."

08:12.817 --> 08:18.721
He was like: "You look like a porn star." Back
then, my tits were bigger than they are now.

08:18.723 --> 08:21.824
I don't know. I have this thing. It's
always been in the back of my head

08:21.826 --> 08:24.096
when I was always too chicken shit
to really do it. And I'm like:

08:25.097 --> 08:27.330
"You're a year away
from being 30, bitch."

08:27.332 --> 08:30.768
Like, if you're gonna do it, do it.
Here's a perfect opportunity.

08:31.803 --> 08:37.407
You know, In the beginning of my career,
I was doing nude modeling, soft porn,

08:37.409 --> 08:41.811
should I say. My first share,
I got a lot of death e-mails

08:41.813 --> 08:48.185
because of the niche of being... there
are no East Indian American porn stars.

08:48.187 --> 08:51.388
You know, there was a lot more going on
in my life than to sit there and worry

08:51.390 --> 08:55.158
about some guy half-way
across the country's opinion

08:55.160 --> 08:57.928
on what I was doing because, guess
what, he's not paying my bills.

08:57.930 --> 09:01.364
And he's probably not paying
for his porn either, so...

09:01.366 --> 09:03.735
Yeah. Doing good? All right.

09:06.338 --> 09:09.172
[grunting]

09:09.174 --> 09:11.041
[Priya] I had to deal with that
within the first year,

09:11.043 --> 09:14.277
but I think, within
the first to second year,

09:14.279 --> 09:16.947
it kind of calmed down
and people begun to love me.

09:16.949 --> 09:20.450
- Who the fuck is that?
- What the fuck is she wearing?

09:20.452 --> 09:23.856
Actually, making hardcore
movies, I went in at 29.

09:24.957 --> 09:27.458
There's days
you go to work, and it's work,

09:27.460 --> 09:31.728
but then there's days you go to work, and
I'm like: "I'm gonna have fun today."

09:31.730 --> 09:37.801
- [man] <i>Look how sexy you are.</i>
- So, let's go play. Hello to my licorice bra.

09:37.803 --> 09:38.971
[gasp]

09:40.172 --> 09:42.772
There are couple of scenes
in the beginning of my career

09:42.774 --> 09:46.176
that taught me a lot
sexually about myself.

09:46.178 --> 09:50.947
- Does that look like something that you like?
- It's so big.

09:50.949 --> 09:52.385
[heavy breathing]

10:02.060 --> 10:04.096
Take a breath.
Where is water at?

10:05.365 --> 10:08.932
[announcer]
<i>Fighting out of Fresno.</i>

10:08.934 --> 10:10.934
<i>This former rodeo rider,</i>

10:10.936 --> 10:14.071
<i>adult star, cage fighter,
total package of dynamite.</i>

10:14.073 --> 10:19.843
- [woman announcer] <i>Blatten Lee!</i>
- [man announcer] <i>Blatten Lee!</i>

10:19.845 --> 10:23.281
It... It was hard for me, because I
had kids. So what I would do is,

10:23.283 --> 10:27.851
I would get up at 7:00 a.m.
get on a flight, come to LA,

10:27.853 --> 10:29.786
be in hair and makeup by 8:30.

10:29.788 --> 10:33.457
Got Priya here and she just
look like a baby hot stuff.

10:33.459 --> 10:37.794
- Look. Is she in this...
- It's so hot outside.

10:37.796 --> 10:40.965
Do my scene, be on the last
flight back home to Phoenix

10:40.967 --> 10:44.402
to be home with my kids for dinner, or
late, you know, to put them to bed.

10:44.404 --> 10:48.439
But that's how I managed a
career for the first two years.

10:48.441 --> 10:51.909
I was going back and forth
almost every other day.

10:51.911 --> 10:55.446
- [woman announcer] <i>Priya!</i>
- [man announcer] <i>Priya!</i>

10:55.448 --> 10:57.850
[Priya] My daughter and I have
a very good relationship,

10:59.852 --> 11:03.187
but it got to a point she'd be at high
school, and she's like, tell everybody:

11:03.189 --> 11:05.957
"My mom's Priya. My mom's
Priya," like: "Stop it!"

11:05.959 --> 11:08.326
Like all these boys
out my door, you know.

11:08.328 --> 11:12.098
I was like: "Do you want them to come
over for you or me, like just stop it!"

11:13.567 --> 11:18.903
[woman announcer] <i>Alright, here we go,
guys. Round one! Oh, shit. Oh, shit.</i>

11:18.905 --> 11:25.176
[Priya] My son, he is now in college and he's
doing well. I think for a couple of years,

11:25.178 --> 11:28.513
it really affected our relationship
as he was going through puberty

11:28.515 --> 11:33.251
and I probably ruined it
for him, but now it's like,

11:33.253 --> 11:36.287
we kind of laugh about it. He's cool
about it. He's like: "Whatever."

11:36.289 --> 11:39.156
He's like: "I know my friends have seen
you." But I just kinda stayed away,

11:39.158 --> 11:42.594
like I don't
go near them on campus."

11:42.596 --> 11:47.098
I did go to his graduation, but I, you
know, kind of just showed up and left.

11:47.100 --> 11:52.271
I don't really linger around his
friends or his people right now.

11:52.273 --> 11:55.140
Just out of respect. He's a straight-A
student. He's getting a full right

11:55.142 --> 11:58.075
scholarship, so that's
a fun little experience.

11:58.077 --> 12:00.312
So that's why
I'm a little jealous

12:00.314 --> 12:03.384
of the whole like, college
experience, but I don't know.

12:08.088 --> 12:09.390
[tense music]

12:21.868 --> 12:25.437
I probably still, uhm,
expect more of myself,

12:25.439 --> 12:32.044
like I could have done it.
I had uhm, extremely high GPA.

12:32.046 --> 12:35.480
You know, I look back being 40,
gonna be 40.

12:35.482 --> 12:39.251
I do wish I could do... could have
done things a little bit differently.

12:39.253 --> 12:42.521
And that's what sucks, like, you
know, just having a couple regrets.

12:42.523 --> 12:47.893
I don't have many regrets because, I've
lived life pretty wildly [laughs].

12:47.895 --> 12:53.031
But, I do have regrets when it's
coming to having a normal life

12:53.033 --> 12:58.203
just like kind of maybe missing out
on doing things like maybe college

12:58.205 --> 13:02.441
or different things like that. I'm sitting
here watching my son go to college

13:02.443 --> 13:05.410
and it's just like: "Wow, I got
to miss out on all of that."

13:05.412 --> 13:07.348
[melancholic music]

13:20.027 --> 13:21.095
Hi.

13:24.164 --> 13:28.168
You're at Expo 2018.

13:30.170 --> 13:32.938
[Buck] In the United States, we don't
really talk about sex and porn.

13:32.940 --> 13:35.241
Yeah, there's a lot of stigma
around pornography.

13:35.243 --> 13:38.043
And that was very difficult for
me to break through this idea,

13:38.045 --> 13:40.413
this stigma
of being a porn star.

13:40.415 --> 13:43.216
[Michael] Nearly everybody
knows a sex worker now,

13:43.218 --> 13:46.686
but everybody keeps it hidden if you're a sex
worker because you don't know who's safe,

13:46.688 --> 13:48.588
you don't know when
it will come back to bite you.

13:48.590 --> 13:50.490
Unfortunately, it's still legal

13:50.492 --> 13:53.058
to discriminate against
sex workers and fire somebody

13:53.060 --> 13:55.595
because they used to be
a sex worker in normal jobs.

13:55.597 --> 14:00.199
[Michael] People have been fired from Subway
because they previously had a porn past.

14:00.201 --> 14:04.404
Teachers have had jobs for 15 years and
they're fired because all of a sudden

14:04.406 --> 14:07.740
they found out they did porn. As if
somehow having done this activity

14:07.742 --> 14:11.244
changes how they'll behave
outwardly in society.

14:11.246 --> 14:16.182
[Kira] Unfortunately, until our society
can see sex workers in a better light,

14:16.184 --> 14:18.618
and we can have more resources
to defend ourselves

14:18.620 --> 14:22.121
and keep ourselves healthy, then people
are going to be able to attack us

14:22.123 --> 14:24.092
as easily as
they have been for centuries.

14:26.094 --> 14:31.431
[Luc] And there's the bad boy, the
Master's choice with Ashley Renee.

14:31.433 --> 14:35.537
She was one of my slaves
before I met you, Alex.

14:37.338 --> 14:39.740
- We should take them into the basement, Luc.
- I know.

14:39.742 --> 14:43.309
Then we have a whole basement
downstairs full of slaves.

14:43.311 --> 14:46.179
- Yeah, that's a whole another show, though.
- Oh. [giggles]

14:46.181 --> 14:47.716
[music]

14:51.252 --> 14:54.253
[whispering]

14:54.255 --> 14:56.022
[woman]
<i>Okay, we'll start from the top.</i>

14:56.024 --> 14:57.758
- Okay.
- Luc Wylder, How did that happen?

14:57.760 --> 14:59.961
How did
Luc Wylder happen? Okay.

15:02.063 --> 15:07.366
[Luc] We're in the mid '70s and
the sex industry was booming.

15:07.368 --> 15:11.772
And Time Square became a mecca

15:11.774 --> 15:15.342
for sexual deviance.

15:15.344 --> 15:20.647
So, I began to explore
and I got into bondage

15:20.649 --> 15:26.453
and discipline and S&M,
and I began to perform

15:26.455 --> 15:31.558
for companies in New York that shot fetish,
like Bizarre Video and Gotham Gold

15:31.560 --> 15:33.560
and Star Maker.

15:33.562 --> 15:38.131
- Master, Luc, she broke your chain.
- She what?

15:38.133 --> 15:39.033
She broke it.

15:40.436 --> 15:45.672
And I got good at it because I had
studied Aikido when I was a kid,

15:45.674 --> 15:48.475
so I was into that
fluid kind of motion

15:48.477 --> 15:55.082
- that is involved in flogging and whipping people.
- [man] Very good.

15:55.084 --> 15:59.720
I was the most in demand
maledom in the adult industry.

15:59.722 --> 16:05.192
And we came out to California and
we began to make films out here.

16:05.194 --> 16:09.730
[Luc] Alexandra, could you come on in here?
Come in here for just a minute.

16:09.732 --> 16:11.298
Wait, wait, wait.

16:11.300 --> 16:14.768
What?
She's crawling into that...

16:14.770 --> 16:18.840
I was sitting over there.
You should see the view I have.

16:18.842 --> 16:23.644
How did I get my star?
Well, I like sex. [laughs]

16:23.646 --> 16:27.715
Let me show you how these work.
I guess you could say,

16:27.717 --> 16:31.618
I was really a fan
more than anything.

16:31.620 --> 16:34.656
I loved watching adult movies.

16:34.658 --> 16:40.728
So, like I knew, like for instance,
my first movie was with Randy West.

16:40.730 --> 16:42.897
Alexandra Silk
is a very hot lady

16:42.899 --> 16:45.567
that had been in the business six
or eight months before I met her.

16:45.569 --> 16:48.870
In fact I met her at David
Christopher's 4th of July party.

16:48.872 --> 16:51.138
You know David, the pussy man?

16:51.140 --> 16:54.141
Ross Sil... I don't know
what the name of...

16:54.143 --> 16:56.312
- Ross Sex.
- Sex. [laughs]

16:58.147 --> 17:03.451
We got married December 31st.
1999 in Las Vegas.

17:03.453 --> 17:07.220
Ah, it was a fucking party, man.

17:07.222 --> 17:12.224
It was not the traditional wedding, though.
[laughs] We had a very...

17:12.227 --> 17:18.165
I had a very short, short, short wedding
dress, [laughs] and no panties.

17:18.166 --> 17:24.741
If you could call that a dress, I suppose. And
the judge was somewhat taken back by that.

17:26.276 --> 17:30.313
- Partied like it was 1999.
- [laughs]

17:31.881 --> 17:36.517
- And you've been my best friend ever since.
- Absolutely.

17:36.519 --> 17:39.756
- Hey, everybody. Come on in.
- Come on in.

17:41.257 --> 17:43.791
Welcome to our home.

17:43.793 --> 17:48.730
[Luc] We had both been married twice
before. Both in open relationships.

17:48.732 --> 17:52.834
We are swingers, and we're very
safe in our practice,

17:52.836 --> 17:57.538
so, we like to encourage that.
As we're always safe,

17:57.540 --> 18:00.708
but never sorry.
[laughter]

18:00.710 --> 18:04.781
- Well, I want to say a little bit more about that.
- Yes, let's go.

18:07.785 --> 18:11.219
We were like... We were just
gonna remain this casual couple

18:11.221 --> 18:14.222
- and we were gonna be fuck buddies...
- Yes, my best friend.

18:14.224 --> 18:16.658
...and have this wonderful life.

18:16.660 --> 18:19.995
Just hanging around.
Waiting for Luc Wylder.

18:19.997 --> 18:21.629
- Oh, there.
- You're waiting for me?

18:21.631 --> 18:23.264
Hi, Luc Wylder.

18:23.266 --> 18:25.768
Oh, my goodness, look this is...

18:25.770 --> 18:30.505
[Luc] In the background we began
to do a lot of work together.

18:30.507 --> 18:36.745
So, we wanted to make films that
had a little bit more credibility.

18:36.747 --> 18:40.649
A little bit more value.
A little bit more oomph.

18:40.651 --> 18:43.487
We built
a company called Fallen Angel.

18:46.389 --> 18:50.693
[Luc] In essence, what we did
was, we created a company

18:50.695 --> 18:55.998
that would distribute adult
video, but on higher standards

18:56.000 --> 18:58.734
than many people were used to.

18:58.736 --> 19:03.505
Let me explain. It's some of the
nastiest sex that you'll ever see.

19:03.507 --> 19:06.475
The guy actually cums
right inside the girl's pussy.

19:06.477 --> 19:11.916
However, they're all couples. It's real
couples having real sex with real cum.

19:15.686 --> 19:18.287
We were offering something
that was different.

19:18.289 --> 19:23.459
This is like I knew it, adult stars
at home. Thanks for doing this.

19:23.461 --> 19:25.994
It was passionate.
It was intense.

19:25.996 --> 19:31.800
The Silk series, remember? I did
a series called, <i>Silk Stockings</i>

19:31.802 --> 19:38.807
in silk panties and silk ties. It
was very high end. It was quality.

19:38.809 --> 19:45.814
Gosh, I remember when we were shooting that
movie, <i>Tramps</i> [giggles] in New Orleans.

19:45.816 --> 19:48.383
[interviewer] What do you think, Alexandra?
You wanna go out there

19:48.385 --> 19:53.355
and play around a little bit and then come
back in here and watch how T. Jay Harkin,

19:53.357 --> 19:56.926
- you know, turn a guy on?
- Oh, yeah.

19:56.928 --> 20:03.699
Mary Gates said: "Would you do a Travel
Log series for us at Adam and Eve?"

20:03.701 --> 20:06.936
We said: "Sure."
[giggles] Road trip.

20:06.938 --> 20:09.306
[rock music]

20:12.409 --> 20:16.045
We went to
12 different states and had...

20:16.047 --> 20:20.449
- Sex across America from San Francisco.
- To New Orleans.

20:20.451 --> 20:25.387
We are headed to New York
next stop. Waikiki, Hawaii.

20:25.389 --> 20:30.827
- Had sex across America.
- I don't think you're telling the whole story.

20:30.829 --> 20:36.601
- [Luc] Give me the camera. Act like you like it.
- [Alexandra] Okay. Wait, wait

20:38.837 --> 20:40.603
[laughing]

20:40.605 --> 20:44.707
Camera...
I think we're gonna crash.

20:44.709 --> 20:49.813
When we first started shooting that series
you were the hostess of the series.

20:49.815 --> 20:51.848
Yeah.

20:51.850 --> 20:54.684
- Isn't that great, guys or what? [laughs]
- You guys are wild.

20:54.686 --> 21:00.623
[Luc] I'm running around the country we're
having all this wild, outrageous sex.

21:00.625 --> 21:05.862
Mhm, and then the second volume we were
on the plane. We're flying everywhere.

21:05.864 --> 21:07.764
I think we're in Hawaii.

21:07.766 --> 21:10.602
[Nic] Have you ever seen
such a beautiful vegetation?

21:11.870 --> 21:17.776
We caught ten-foot long blue marlins
naked on a fishing boat in Hawaii.

21:19.744 --> 21:26.616
We had sex in hot air balloons. I mean this
was a series where we really got to do

21:26.618 --> 21:29.053
the things that you would
want to do in a Travel Log.

21:29.055 --> 21:31.454
That was so fun. [laughs]

21:31.456 --> 21:33.556
[Luc] At the time, we were
able to take the series

21:33.558 --> 21:36.526
and really kind of
elevate the porn

21:36.528 --> 21:39.596
that we were shooting at that time.
Through the locations,

21:39.598 --> 21:44.467
through the people that we would
encounter while we were traveling.

21:44.469 --> 21:49.041
Oh my gosh, that was, wait.
That was just... No snoring.

21:50.675 --> 21:53.576
What a pivoting
point in our life.

21:53.578 --> 21:58.481
That we're having fun
traveling across America

21:58.483 --> 21:59.352
and then,

22:00.485 --> 22:01.653
all of a sudden,

22:02.955 --> 22:05.457
mom gets sick.

22:06.458 --> 22:09.927
While we were in New Jersey,

22:09.929 --> 22:14.031
taking... caring for my mother,
I went back to school.

22:14.033 --> 22:18.669
And I completed
my degree in Psychology.

22:18.671 --> 22:21.705
So, when we came back,

22:21.707 --> 22:27.077
and went back to Chatsworth,
everyone else was gone.

22:27.079 --> 22:29.013
Where did everybody go?
What happened?

22:29.015 --> 22:31.081
- In the adult industry
- What the fuck happened?

22:31.083 --> 22:35.488
- Chatsworth was the porn capital of the world.
- Maybe.

22:37.590 --> 22:41.892
[Luc] All of those buildings, all
of those companies had closed up.

22:41.894 --> 22:44.228
Chatsworth had
turned into a ghost town

22:44.230 --> 22:47.865
and all the companies
and people that we knew

22:47.867 --> 22:49.733
were no longer there.

22:49.735 --> 22:53.904
I understand now that
our circumstances had changed.

22:53.906 --> 22:56.274
So, you know,
it's interesting. We're not

22:56.276 --> 22:59.677
who we are in our 20's, it's
not who we are in our 30's,

22:59.679 --> 23:05.015
and it's not who we are in our 40's.
We just keep evolving, you know.

23:05.017 --> 23:07.651
I always go to
my passion, you know.

23:07.653 --> 23:11.889
Where's my passion in life?
What can I do next?

23:11.891 --> 23:13.924
Consequently, both Alex and I

23:13.926 --> 23:18.129
have now achieved our doctorates
in Human Sexology.

23:18.131 --> 23:24.202
Well, I became certified
surrogate partner therapist.

23:24.204 --> 23:30.308
And there's only 19 in the United
States and I'm one of them.

23:30.310 --> 23:35.746
It's very, uhm, serious work,
it's healing work.

23:35.748 --> 23:39.818
And it's my way
of giving back to the world.

23:39.820 --> 23:43.190
One orgasm at a time.
[laughs] Right?

23:48.028 --> 23:52.563
To go and meet a complete stranger,
have sex in front of 20 people,

23:52.565 --> 23:59.070
no Viagra, no male enhancement pills,
it's very difficult to stay hard

23:59.072 --> 24:03.975
and not cum immediately. So if you can prove
that you can do that, you have a shot.

24:03.977 --> 24:07.045
Anybody can do it, but not
everybody can be successful at it.

24:07.047 --> 24:10.048
Especially not long-term.
And it is fun,

24:10.050 --> 24:13.618
it is an alternative lifestyle, but
it's not a joke, it's not a game.

24:13.620 --> 24:16.654
It is a career
and it is a big business

24:16.656 --> 24:19.793
that can be very lucrative
or very damaging to somebody.

24:27.067 --> 24:29.634
- [man] Wow.
- Hi.

24:29.636 --> 24:33.339
[man] Hi, yourself.
How are you there, beautiful?

24:33.341 --> 24:39.077
- Good. How are you doing?
- [man] How am I doing? How are you doing?

24:39.079 --> 24:43.615
[man] I'm doing fine, thank you for
asking me. Now that you're here,

24:43.617 --> 24:45.016
Wow, what's
your name, gorgeous?

24:45.018 --> 24:47.986
[continuous low buzz]

24:47.988 --> 24:50.224
[muted] Shh.

24:57.265 --> 25:00.865
[preacher] <i>What is that one
thing that you're holding on to?</i>

25:00.867 --> 25:04.002
<i>That's making you become stuck
and you can't move forward?</i>

25:04.004 --> 25:08.174
<i>Some of us will hold you onto
unforgiveness. We're holding on to pain,</i>

25:08.176 --> 25:11.643
<i>we're holding on to bad relationships.
We're holding on to friendship,</i>

25:11.645 --> 25:13.979
<i>and we're holding on to
all of these things</i>

25:13.981 --> 25:17.016
<i>and this is the reason
why we can't move forward.</i>

25:17.018 --> 25:20.086
<i>God gives you a new thing
in you when you're surrounded</i>

25:20.088 --> 25:21.621
<i>by people who hinder you.</i>

25:23.524 --> 25:28.060
[Jenna] <i>The unconditional love of God means
that no matter what this person did to me,</i>

25:28.062 --> 25:30.429
<i>I will still love them.
I will not hate them.</i>

25:30.431 --> 25:34.300
<i>Don't hate your enemies,
love your enemies.</i>

25:34.302 --> 25:36.871
<i>Let me love people through you.</i>

25:47.281 --> 25:50.985
[tense music]

26:03.764 --> 26:06.432
[Jenna] There were a lot of
factors throughout my childhood

26:06.434 --> 26:10.002
and throughout my teenage years
that would've resulted in me

26:10.004 --> 26:15.808
getting into the porn industry. I constantly
had to live up to unfair standards.

26:15.810 --> 26:18.978
You know, if I had
a B+ plus on a report card,

26:18.980 --> 26:21.981
it was ripped up in front of my
face, and I was called a loser.

26:21.983 --> 26:27.286
I started, you know, searching
for ways to become perfect.

26:27.288 --> 26:30.423
And that's kind of where things
started for me because I thought:

26:30.425 --> 26:33.759
"Well if I could just be skinny enough,
maybe then my mom will love me.

26:33.761 --> 26:36.729
If I can be perfect enough
and my grades are good enough,

26:36.731 --> 26:38.166
then maybe I'll be loved."

26:39.767 --> 26:44.904
[Jenna] I remember watching, you know,
the E-channel and seeing Jenna Jameson,

26:44.906 --> 26:50.843
the other vivid girls and it
looked glitzy and glamorous.

26:50.845 --> 26:54.980
And it looked like everything
that I wanted to become.

26:54.982 --> 27:00.953
They really portrayed the industry to be
something that was lavish and beautiful.

27:00.955 --> 27:03.023
So, that's what
I was expecting.

27:03.025 --> 27:05.325
Hey, Jenna, there's going
to be a strip down here,

27:05.327 --> 27:08.161
- we'll just take cold pictures.
- Okay.

27:08.163 --> 27:09.396
- Okay?
- Okay.

27:09.398 --> 27:11.531
Okay. Hell, are you pretty?

27:11.533 --> 27:15.135
[man] Yeah, you might be...
Yeah. Yeah well, yeah.

27:15.137 --> 27:17.803
Yeah just stay there, strip down
and let's take cold pictures.

27:17.805 --> 27:19.406
But, I need to
take all of my clothes?

27:19.408 --> 27:21.774
- Yes, all of them, sorry.
- Really?

27:21.776 --> 27:24.077
It is poignant. You are playing
with the other camera, right?

27:24.079 --> 27:25.912
Well, but I haven't ever
done it before, so

27:25.914 --> 27:28.848
- I was trying to get some...
- Okay, I'm not...

27:28.850 --> 27:30.884
[man] You've never taken
your clothes off before?

27:30.886 --> 27:33.453
Must be a bitch
when you shower. [laughter]

27:33.455 --> 27:37.857
- But, I haven't in front of boys?
- Oh, I see.

27:37.859 --> 27:39.359
[director] Would it help
if I was naked too?

27:39.361 --> 27:42.028
[man] Please don't...
Don't go to that extreme.

27:42.030 --> 27:48.503
Alright, let's... Let's get this going because
we got business. For other bitches to see.

27:49.438 --> 27:54.575
It's so horrific to be asked, is it
okay if a guy spits in your face?

27:54.577 --> 27:59.913
Is it okay if a guy slaps you
and pulls your hair really hard?

27:59.915 --> 28:03.416
But at that time of my life, to me
it was like: "Oh yeah, that's cool.

28:03.418 --> 28:06.319
They want to shoot me.
At least I'm wanted."

28:06.321 --> 28:08.922
[man] <i>Do you think you might be interested
in doing a little hardcore stuff out there?</i>

28:08.924 --> 28:11.157
- How much are we talking?
- <i>A thousand.</i>

28:11.159 --> 28:12.859
I'll do it.
I'll do it.

28:12.861 --> 28:14.595
[applause from audience]

28:14.597 --> 28:17.897
Brittni Ruiz who was known
to millions as Jenna Presley.

28:17.899 --> 28:20.301
One of the biggest stars
in the porn industry.

28:20.303 --> 28:24.338
Brittni, I remember we had someone on
here who was the CEO of a porn company.

28:24.340 --> 28:26.840
He said: "Women in porn,
they were empowered."

28:26.842 --> 28:30.578
You did about three sex scenes
a day, did you feel empowered?

28:30.580 --> 28:36.317
In the beginning I felt beautiful. Like
I felt like I had found my self-worth.

28:36.319 --> 28:40.588
And after a while, I felt destroyed,
hopeless, I felt helpless.

28:40.590 --> 28:42.989
[camera man] And here we are. Come on,
bring it right here. Come on, baby.

28:42.991 --> 28:44.158
Okay.

28:44.160 --> 28:45.461
- This is a set.
- Okay.

28:46.596 --> 28:49.130
[camera man] I was just going to
sit down and watch the monitor.

28:49.132 --> 28:52.233
- Show her what to do.
- Okay, well, I guess the first thing we will do

28:52.235 --> 28:54.135
is to show off
how beautiful you are.

28:54.137 --> 28:57.571
Okay. [laughs]
So, this is where porn happen?

28:57.573 --> 29:00.274
M-hm.
Spin you around.

29:00.276 --> 29:04.478
[Jenna] And it wasn't until I went into the
church and truly surrendered my life to God

29:04.480 --> 29:08.249
and I said: "God, whatever your
word says in this book right here,

29:08.251 --> 29:10.985
I'm gonna do it. Whatever it
says, I'm gonna do it."

29:10.987 --> 29:15.089
And I started following all of his commands,
every word that I saw in this Bible.

29:15.091 --> 29:17.558
I started to just do it.

29:17.560 --> 29:21.395
I hit rock bottom
in the porn industry twice.

29:21.397 --> 29:26.300
Uhm, the first one was
really, really bad.

29:26.302 --> 29:28.670
Okay, let's all
stand for prayer.

29:28.672 --> 29:34.141
This was the time where I was a full-blown
heroin addict. I was doing a lot of it.

29:34.143 --> 29:37.111
Father, we come before
you, Lord in the name of Jesus.

29:37.113 --> 29:40.615
And, God I thank you for what you're
doing in these women's lives, Lord.

29:40.617 --> 29:44.553
I was depressed and I was suicidal.
I wanted to take my life,

29:44.555 --> 29:46.588
but I was such a people pleaser

29:46.590 --> 29:49.658
that I felt like I was gonna
let the directors down

29:49.660 --> 29:52.293
if I didn't
show up to perform a scene.

29:52.295 --> 29:54.962
[Jenna} God, I thank you that we are
learning to take the limits off of ourselves

29:54.964 --> 29:58.332
that we could do all things through
Christ who strengthens us.

29:58.334 --> 30:01.035
So, I thought:
"Okay." I can't commit suicide

30:01.037 --> 30:04.004
because there's too many people
that are counting on me."

30:04.006 --> 30:06.240
I wanted to cut my wrist,

30:06.242 --> 30:08.543
I wanted to do something,
I just want to hurt myself,

30:08.545 --> 30:13.180
I just wanted to feel something. I
felt so numb and I felt so lonely.

30:13.182 --> 30:19.254
And I ended up just going to a tattoo shop and
I started getting tattoos all over my body

30:19.256 --> 30:23.090
because I thought at least then
I can feel something, you know.

30:23.092 --> 30:28.697
Ans then the next day when I went to
go do the movie, I had a girl tell me:

30:28.699 --> 30:33.168
"What did you do to yourself? Why did you get
all these big tattoos all over your body?

30:33.170 --> 30:38.740
Nobody's going to want to hire you now."
Once again in my life, I felt rejected.

30:38.742 --> 30:44.513
And that was that point where I said: "Okay,
I'm done with the porn industry, I'm leaving.

30:44.515 --> 30:47.983
Like I'm not even going
to be accepted here anymore."

30:47.985 --> 30:51.586
And so I left for
the first time.

30:51.588 --> 30:54.258
[instrumental music]

31:09.706 --> 31:13.375
[Jenna] I thought when I quit the
first time, that I was gonna be done.

31:13.377 --> 31:19.715
I had gone to church and that was when I
accepted Jesus as my Lord and Savior,

31:19.717 --> 31:25.320
but I didn't understand the importance
of having a relationship with God

31:25.322 --> 31:28.791
because, having that relationship with
God, that's where you get strength

31:28.793 --> 31:31.761
from God
is spending time with Him.

31:31.763 --> 31:36.599
Do you want something to eat?
Or take it later.

31:36.601 --> 31:38.433
Do you want me to pray for you?

31:38.435 --> 31:40.235
My weakness at that time

31:40.237 --> 31:43.539
in my life, was men.
If you sent me a man,

31:43.541 --> 31:47.643
I would instantly fall in love.
I felt like somebody wanted me

31:47.645 --> 31:53.649
and I almost felt safer because I wasn't alone.
I had a guy that God placed into my life

31:53.651 --> 31:57.787
and then he took me to church
and then I got baptized.

31:57.789 --> 32:03.626
I'm reading the Bible and I'm starting to
do really good, and then this guy says:

32:03.628 --> 32:06.397
"You are gonna be a
bigger star than ever before."

32:07.365 --> 32:12.237
[Jenna] It turns out he was a pimp, he
got me back into the porn industry...

32:14.239 --> 32:16.174
for another
three and a half years.

32:18.776 --> 32:22.745
It's a vicious cycle, in the porn
industry, it starts with one thing

32:22.747 --> 32:27.149
and it's just goes on to the next
and to the next and to the next

32:27.151 --> 32:31.122
until you just feel hopeless.

32:33.525 --> 32:37.627
I knew that my life was gonna
change forever when I met Jesus

32:37.629 --> 32:42.598
because a man cannot change your life.
Because, a man is not your Savior,

32:42.600 --> 32:44.800
God is our Savior,
Jesus is our Savior.

32:44.802 --> 32:48.604
That's the only person that
could ever transform my life.

32:48.606 --> 32:55.645
God used Richard a lot in my life, so to
be a part of him moving to change my life.

32:55.647 --> 33:00.616
[Richard] And what I think the Triple X business
does, is that it gives you temporary relief.

33:00.618 --> 33:05.822
It gives you the sense of wow, people are
noticing me, wow, I have money in my pocket

33:05.824 --> 33:10.126
but it doesn't fulfill your heart
and your soul. It gave her promises

33:10.128 --> 33:14.865
that it cannot fulfill. It told
her what she could have, but yet,

33:14.867 --> 33:19.502
it didn't fulfill her heart. It told
her she was gonna be appreciated,

33:19.504 --> 33:23.774
but the moment when she was reaching for
help, nobody was reaching out for her.

33:23.776 --> 33:29.478
[Jenna] I want you to know that you are not alone.
Anytime that you feel like you are unworthy,

33:29.480 --> 33:34.851
God wants you to know that you are worthy. And
It just takes a bold step of faith of saying:

33:34.853 --> 33:38.689
"You know what, I'm done." And faith,
it's being sure of what you hope for

33:38.691 --> 33:42.492
and certain of what you do not see.
So you may not see the better life,

33:42.494 --> 33:45.294
but you just have to have faith to
believe that there is a better life

33:45.296 --> 33:48.567
and God wants to give you that better
life, he really does. [applause]

33:57.343 --> 34:02.946
For all you new girls, remember that this
is forever. The internet is completely

34:02.948 --> 34:05.849
and totally forever
and you can't take it back,

34:05.851 --> 34:09.822
your friends and family will find out.
You will get harassed by people.

34:10.755 --> 34:12.822
This will affect
the rest of your life.

34:12.824 --> 34:14.858
I've definitely seen girls
in the industry

34:14.860 --> 34:16.960
where I'm like: "This
is not a good place for you.

34:16.962 --> 34:21.797
You shouldn't be here." [laugh]
Uhm, and it is a tough industry.

34:21.800 --> 34:25.469
You've got to have guts in porn nowadays
because you are going to be judged.

34:25.471 --> 34:29.773
So, you have to be okay with yourself and
we all struggle, there is insecurities,

34:29.775 --> 34:32.944
we're all nervous about our bodies
and our minds and our future.

34:32.946 --> 34:36.413
But, you really do have to have a strong
will when you come into this industry.

34:36.415 --> 34:39.416
Especially, if you're younger and
I completely acknowledge that,

34:39.418 --> 34:41.784
it's called "adult
entertainment" for a reason.

34:41.786 --> 34:44.556
Like you kind of have to be
an adult to thrive.

34:48.828 --> 34:51.728
I'm really glad that I get to be
on your documentary finally.

34:51.730 --> 34:53.532
It's about time
you guys asked me.

34:54.768 --> 34:56.534
I'm lying,
they've asked me every time.

34:58.303 --> 35:05.009
We're each other's holiday presents every day
of the week here on vivid radio SiriusXM.

35:05.011 --> 35:11.015
I've actually been with Vivid Radio which
is on SiriusXM for the past three years.

35:11.017 --> 35:17.555
And then before that, I was on Playboy
Radio for 10 years on SiriusXM,

35:17.557 --> 35:19.857
So I just... I had
like a two week period off

35:19.859 --> 35:24.729
and then just right back in business.
And I love radio, it is so much fun.

35:24.731 --> 35:27.498
<i>It's Vivid radio's
winter holiday special</i>

35:27.500 --> 35:29.967
<i>here on SiriusXM 415.</i>

35:29.969 --> 35:36.607
Your girls, here to just warm
you up this holiday season.

35:36.609 --> 35:43.414
I definitely am not over sex after being
around since I was 18 in this business.

35:43.416 --> 35:46.619
18, that's been in
like two decades now.

35:48.455 --> 35:52.457
Looking for that lightning bolt
to strike me. [laughs]

35:52.459 --> 35:55.560
Hey, boys, I'm Christy.

35:55.562 --> 35:56.761
[rock music]

35:56.763 --> 35:58.732
[rock and roll music]

36:02.335 --> 36:04.936
- What's your fantasy?
- I've got to hand it to you, Paul,

36:04.938 --> 36:07.004
you outdid
yourself this time.

36:07.006 --> 36:09.440
[Christy] I got in trouble
because my girlfriend and I made

36:09.442 --> 36:11.342
Playboys
and we sold them to the boys.

36:11.344 --> 36:12.877
They were like stick figures.

36:12.879 --> 36:15.613
But like I'm sure
there was like this big weeny

36:15.615 --> 36:18.916
going on [laughs]
and boobs or something.

36:18.918 --> 36:20.718
So, I think
it was from an early age

36:20.720 --> 36:23.855
that I'd somehow been
in some kind of a business

36:23.857 --> 36:26.994
with nudity, I guess.
I don't know.

36:29.829 --> 36:32.363
When I got in the business,
I wasn't talking to my parents.

36:32.365 --> 36:34.867
Never was abused, I don't
fall under that, never was hit,

36:34.869 --> 36:38.402
never was molested by anyone.
I was just rebellious.

36:38.404 --> 36:42.575
And I just knew that I'd... I had to be in
control of my life when I was 17 and moved out.

36:43.911 --> 36:50.849
So, when I got into the business and I had
no money, nothing. And I hated that, like...

36:50.851 --> 36:54.385
I hated being in that position and
then when I met somebody and they're:

36:54.387 --> 36:57.455
"Oh, you can make, you know,
500 a day or 200, whatever."

36:57.457 --> 37:02.060
For an 18-year-old that was making like
150 a week working 40 hours at a job,

37:02.062 --> 37:03.561
it was like: "Wow!"

37:03.563 --> 37:04.797
You don't need a car like this

37:04.799 --> 37:06.834
to take a beautiful woman out.

37:08.135 --> 37:12.436
- You're a beautiful woman.
- Thank you.

37:12.438 --> 37:17.441
My first scenes that I look back on, nothing
against Ron Jeremy because he's one

37:17.443 --> 37:21.379
of my best friends and I love him, that
was the scariest fucking day of my life.

37:21.381 --> 37:22.883
Looking for...

37:24.084 --> 37:29.421
hot babe with big huge tits

37:29.423 --> 37:31.156
for a loving couple.

37:31.158 --> 37:34.493
Like I really thought I was
going to a magazine or whatever

37:34.495 --> 37:37.529
and it was a loop, which I didn't
know what a loop was at 18,

37:37.531 --> 37:42.801
it turned out it was a porn, and I'd been doing
magazines for like three or four months.

37:42.803 --> 37:45.170
Uhm, it was with
Ron Jeremy and another couple.

37:45.172 --> 37:48.841
[everybody] Come on.

37:48.843 --> 37:52.444
- Well... Oh, what the fuck.
- [everybody] Alright. Yeah.

37:52.446 --> 37:54.913
And it was just scary. I don't
care who the guy or girl was,

37:54.915 --> 38:00.018
it was like: "Oh my God, I'm having sex on
film." How... And I don't mean to be mean

38:00.020 --> 38:04.190
because it turned out great for me eventually.
"How low has my fucking life sunk?"

38:04.192 --> 38:08.762
Oh, my God!
Thank you, Lord. Oh, God.

38:09.763 --> 38:14.666
But, then like the next time I did a
scene and it was with Ginger Lynn.

38:14.668 --> 38:18.938
- Let's take a bath together.
- Together in there?

38:18.940 --> 38:21.740
I'd never been with a girl. I was
like: "Not only is it with a girl,

38:21.742 --> 38:23.711
but look how cute she is."

38:25.512 --> 38:30.582
There was a whole different vibe on the set.
It was like these really great looking people.

38:30.584 --> 38:35.989
Like I get to have sex with them and they're
paying me. I felt like a movie star.

38:35.991 --> 38:41.627
I did a lot of firsts on camera,
inter-racial, gangbang, girls.

38:41.629 --> 38:44.630
I didn't know what was going to
happen, but then he introduced me

38:44.632 --> 38:47.566
to this beautiful woman,
Catherine.

38:47.568 --> 38:49.836
Well, hurry up
and get to the good stuff.

38:49.838 --> 38:53.472
[Christy] Eighties, we made nothing,
but fuck it was fun. It was fun,

38:53.474 --> 38:57.110
learned a lot about sex,
can't put a price tag on that.

38:57.112 --> 39:01.513
Has TV almost gotten you
to a point of turning it off?

39:01.515 --> 39:05.587
Well, don't pull that plug, because
we're going to turn you on.

39:10.725 --> 39:12.994
[Christy] This business has
had more integrity for me.

39:13.962 --> 39:18.264
I don't think you have to sleep your way in
po... At least not in the '80's and '90's.

39:18.266 --> 39:23.069
It's like... they were like: "Oh, my God,
a girl wants to fuck on film for $500?

39:23.071 --> 39:26.172
Hire her." Like they didn't
wanna like ruin a good thing

39:26.174 --> 39:29.876
because back in the '80's,
very few girls were doing it.

39:29.878 --> 39:33.046
Never made to do a se... Like a
sex act that I wasn't got,

39:33.048 --> 39:38.751
I never did anal, I never did DP, not because
there's anything wrong with it, wasn't my choice.

39:38.753 --> 39:42.757
No one said: "Well, we can't hire you if
you don't take two dicks up your ass." No.

39:44.092 --> 39:49.196
In September of 1990 is when
I signed my contract with,

39:49.198 --> 39:52.632
what was then
known as Vivid Video.

39:52.634 --> 39:54.867
And it was the best move.

39:54.869 --> 39:59.872
I never left. Because the fucking
'90's rocked money-wise.

39:59.874 --> 40:01.743
I mean, they were amazing.

40:03.745 --> 40:08.082
[Christy] I never compared myself
to anyone. I was my own person.

40:08.084 --> 40:10.683
I didn't have to be number one.

40:10.685 --> 40:11.886
I mean I kind of was.

40:16.859 --> 40:19.226
[Christy]
<i>Men are only after two things,</i>

40:19.228 --> 40:24.164
<i>pussy and money, and
fortunately, I've got both.</i>

40:24.166 --> 40:25.767
[laughter]

40:27.736 --> 40:31.571
[Christy] And then in here
is the messy office.

40:31.573 --> 40:36.710
Like this photo that was taken
of me, about two years ago.

40:36.712 --> 40:41.614
Oh, that is lovely. No, I'm just kidding.
It's like 1985. This was a big fucking hit

40:41.616 --> 40:43.719
and I made $400 off of it.

40:44.787 --> 40:47.254
And so... Oh, you know what,
this was another great thing.

40:47.256 --> 40:51.025
It's a little dusty.
My action figure doll.

40:51.027 --> 40:54.328
I wouldn't wanna meet that
version of me in a dark alley.

40:54.330 --> 40:56.730
Hey, wait, where's that
nice young boy?

40:56.732 --> 41:00.834
I was going to give him a tub
of Vivid condoms. [chuckles]

41:00.836 --> 41:03.637
That's for you.
It's your little party gift.

41:03.639 --> 41:05.839
There you go.
Wear them in good health.

41:05.841 --> 41:08.876
It was just a different time. It
was innocent. It was underground.

41:08.878 --> 41:13.814
It was hidden. It was wonderful and
it was just a cozy little family.

41:13.816 --> 41:18.152
The one thing that I will never ever
get rid of, and it's in my office,

41:18.154 --> 41:24.224
it's a big poster from one of the AVN shows
of all the Vivid girls, Janine, Jenteal...

41:24.226 --> 41:28.829
and we all signed a poster to each other.
See? That's the thing with me.

41:28.831 --> 41:33.301
That's why I have no bad feelings about this
business. I never took any of it seriously.

41:33.303 --> 41:37.704
It's a sex clinic
ran by Dr. Phil Lashio.

41:37.706 --> 41:41.342
It was just
my job and a fun fucking job.

41:41.344 --> 41:47.350
- Who wants to see me fuck the shit out of Steve?
- Yes! Yes.

41:49.852 --> 41:53.954
I mean, I took a break for maybe a year,
came back. I made like three comebacks.

41:53.956 --> 41:57.791
Every time I got divorced, I'd make a
comeback. As they were like moving out,

41:57.793 --> 42:01.829
I'd be like, "Time to make a comeback,
Steve. Yeah, wait, he's packing up now."

42:01.831 --> 42:05.666
Yeah, okay. I'm ready. Uh-huh. All right. Yes,
it was great while it lasted. All right."

42:05.668 --> 42:09.204
So, anyway, can you get Tony to dashy
up, always want to have sex with him."

42:09.206 --> 42:13.774
I just didn't miss a beat. I don't
have one complaint about the business.

42:13.776 --> 42:20.181
I loved it. I loved it. If I could go back
in time and do films again under that era,

42:20.183 --> 42:24.119
I would do it in a heartbeat. I mean,
I knew that there was a certain age

42:24.121 --> 42:28.823
where I wanted to hang it up.
I don't even know why.

42:28.825 --> 42:31.292
I think 14 years was enough,
but I thought:

42:31.294 --> 42:34.364
"What do I want to do
after porn ends?"

42:36.967 --> 42:43.338
- Annie Cruise, what is your cock fucking choice for the holidays?
- Oh, lot of anal.

42:43.340 --> 42:46.309
The new girl today. They will
do anything. [chuckles]

42:48.078 --> 42:51.379
So, I felt this warm sensation
in my throat and I'm going:

42:51.381 --> 42:54.082
"Oh, my God." I wasn't expecting...
I didn't mean to be honest,

42:54.084 --> 42:59.020
- I didn't even know what it was.
- The majority of men, they want to fuck a woman's ass.

42:59.022 --> 43:01.890
Rap their dick in a little bow and
then, they can come feed it to me.

43:01.892 --> 43:04.826
She can do triple vag,
triple anal.

43:04.828 --> 43:05.894
Have them faced

43:05.896 --> 43:07.429
like their ass facing me.

43:07.431 --> 43:10.798
I want the tit
fucking Christmas cocks.

43:10.800 --> 43:13.101
- It's going to be like a fuck of the year.
- It's just fun.

43:13.103 --> 43:16.372
It's just a good...
Good old like,

43:16.374 --> 43:19.341
I... uhm, don't know
if I can make films again,

43:19.343 --> 43:21.510
and yet, I love the business.

43:21.512 --> 43:23.512
So it just kind of
keeps me in the loop.

43:23.514 --> 43:26.415
And I think just
through porn and even radio,

43:26.417 --> 43:29.884
I've learned so much more
about sex, obviously.

43:29.886 --> 43:33.821
I mean people call in
and they give me tips sometimes.

43:33.823 --> 43:35.990
Something about a loofa
on her boyfriend's dick.

43:35.992 --> 43:38.294
I don't know. I tried it.
It was actually good.

43:38.296 --> 43:39.829
Thank you, Bob in Michigan.

43:43.000 --> 43:45.967
This is an entertainment business,
and entertainment is tough,

43:45.969 --> 43:48.204
and it's competitive.
And it's not particularly fair.

43:48.206 --> 43:50.206
Because people get very excited
and they think

43:50.208 --> 43:52.942
it's easy money
coming from all directions.

43:52.944 --> 43:56.378
And You can get a quick influx
of money when you're brand new,

43:56.380 --> 43:59.381
but you have to make sure that you're
sustaining yourself long terms.

43:59.383 --> 44:02.851
Well, back in the day,
people would shoot one movie

44:02.853 --> 44:07.156
and you would get up to $30,000 for shooting
one movie. It's not like that anymore.

44:07.158 --> 44:10.793
I think the most valuable thing a
performer especially can do nowadays

44:10.795 --> 44:12.428
is make, produce,
and own your own content.

44:12.430 --> 44:14.029
I produce my own content,

44:14.031 --> 44:17.866
I webcam,
I do custom videos. I do porn.

44:17.868 --> 44:21.003
I do a little bit of camming,
a little bit of everything.

44:21.005 --> 44:24.139
I made an identity out of myself and
that was the best thing that I ever did

44:24.141 --> 44:26.542
was trademarking myself
and creating a brand.

44:26.544 --> 44:29.144
I think now more than ever,
performers really do have

44:29.146 --> 44:32.248
more control over their brands
and their success

44:32.250 --> 44:34.116
and their future
than ever before.

44:34.118 --> 44:36.986
Having an extra...
that extra income

44:36.988 --> 44:38.854
gives you the ability to say:

44:38.856 --> 44:41.924
"You know what, no,
I don't wanna shoot that scene.

44:41.926 --> 44:45.227
I'm gonna shoot the type of scenes that
I want to shoot and I want to be...

44:45.229 --> 44:48.132
This is the way
that I want people to see me."

44:51.068 --> 44:55.372
[Tera] <i>Boy on a Dolphin,</i> Sophia Loren.
This woman could come out of the ocean.

44:55.374 --> 45:00.276
<i>He was laughing at me, the boy.
He was all good, so big.</i>

45:00.278 --> 45:06.915
[Tera] She was in my opinion and still is
the sultry siren. It was incredible to me.

45:06.917 --> 45:10.986
So, I wanted to relive that,
and feel that on stage.

45:10.988 --> 45:14.624
And every time, still to this
day, it's why I haven't stopped.

45:14.626 --> 45:17.527
[rock music]

45:17.529 --> 45:23.466
My father was in the Vietnam war. He's
hippie. He was drafted over to Vietnam,

45:23.468 --> 45:27.437
met my mother there. They were both
very young and they fell in love fast.

45:27.439 --> 45:32.908
My mother, she did the best she could.
I think that after 10 years,

45:32.910 --> 45:39.482
she saw a bigger world outside of Montana,
and was like, [speaking Italian].

45:39.484 --> 45:43.953
So, I was raised by my father. My
father and I from a very early age

45:43.955 --> 45:48.625
had a very close relationship.
My dad was into Rock and Roll.

45:48.627 --> 45:53.229
He grew weed. He was studying to be a
winemaker. You know, he was a bit rogue.

45:53.231 --> 45:56.968
Even if he personally didn't like
something, I knew that I could go home.

45:58.370 --> 46:02.906
So at age 13, we enrolled me
in Barbizon Modeling school.

46:02.908 --> 46:04.474
I think just out of necessity.

46:04.476 --> 46:07.110
[all] <i>Welcome to Barbizon.</i>
[cheering]

46:07.112 --> 46:08.978
So he said: "She'll go
to this modeling school.

46:08.980 --> 46:11.448
These, you know...
These people will teach her

46:11.450 --> 46:14.317
everything she needs to know
and she'll come out a lady."

46:14.319 --> 46:17.354
<i>And you become a really unique
and wholesome person.</i>

46:17.356 --> 46:19.055
Okay, sort of.

46:19.057 --> 46:21.026
[instrumental music]

46:24.564 --> 46:28.231
I look at these pictures of myself,
and I can... I can tell you

46:28.233 --> 46:33.370
every single picture I've
ever taken, where I've been.

46:33.372 --> 46:37.073
I was 15, living abroad,
working as a model.

46:37.075 --> 46:39.344
Now this, I think, this would
be considered trafficking.

46:44.316 --> 46:48.251
But I remember my dad
always said, you know,

46:48.253 --> 46:51.223
the one thing he wanted
me to be was fearless.

46:56.094 --> 47:02.233
Paulina Porizkova was the first model
that I can remember being wow.

47:02.235 --> 47:04.301
And it was because
she'd been in Playboy.

47:04.303 --> 47:07.304
I'd taken my dad had that
issue with her on the cover.

47:07.306 --> 47:09.375
She was a supermodel, Paulina.

47:10.376 --> 47:13.577
Seeing her in that Playboy, really
changed it for me, because I realized:

47:13.579 --> 47:17.381
"Wait, you can do both.
You can be an elegant woman

47:17.383 --> 47:24.388
and show your body and, you know,
uh, get naked, and it's okay."

47:24.390 --> 47:26.724
You know, the more fashion
models that I saw,

47:26.726 --> 47:29.160
Linda Evangelista,
Christy Turlington,

47:29.162 --> 47:33.497
this was Yasmeen Ghauri. This was
the height of the supermodel.

47:33.499 --> 47:38.335
There was something missing about them, in my
opinion, and it was that they weren't sexual.

47:38.337 --> 47:41.539
They just didn't... I always kind
of gravitated to Sophia Loren,

47:41.541 --> 47:44.675
Marilyn Monroe. I liked...
I liked the va-va-voom.

47:44.677 --> 47:47.578
I found myself
attracted to women

47:47.580 --> 47:50.347
that were, in my opinion,
just uninhibited.

47:50.349 --> 47:53.319
<i>♪ Pa-dam
pa-dam pa-tudeli-dam, pooh ♪</i>

47:55.221 --> 47:57.724
[Tera] You're really treated.

47:59.292 --> 48:04.628
If you don't work,
we have 10,000 other girls.

48:04.630 --> 48:11.101
It's not ten, it's not five, it's 10,000
other girls. So, I gave up modeling.

48:11.103 --> 48:16.106
I came to Los Angeles, I wanted to
pursue working as a nurse anesthetist.

48:16.108 --> 48:18.409
I had applied at school here.

48:18.411 --> 48:22.112
[camera man] <i>I was just thinking
that you might be a model, are you?</i>

48:22.114 --> 48:24.616
No, I'm a student.
Can't you tell?

48:24.618 --> 48:29.353
- <i>Oh...</i>
- Yeah, I just came home from school.

48:29.355 --> 48:32.757
[Tera] Playboy was doing one of
their <i>Girls of the Campus</i>

48:32.759 --> 48:34.728
or I don't even remember
the exact title.

48:35.762 --> 48:40.465
And I can remember going through the
Playboy Studio West in Santa Monica.

48:40.467 --> 48:45.470
It's kind of the first taste I had
had of... They brought me champagne.

48:45.472 --> 48:50.308
Marilyn said: "You're great." I went
to The Mansion a week later. I'm like:

48:50.310 --> 48:53.545
"You know what, hmm, nursing just
isn't gonna cut it anymore."

48:53.547 --> 48:56.080
You get a taste
of this amazing life.

48:56.082 --> 49:00.721
It was 10 star, you had publicity.
They took such good care of us.

49:01.822 --> 49:06.858
I'm the only woman who's been
featured on the cover of Pent...

49:06.860 --> 49:09.861
I was Penthouse Pet of the Year
in February of 2002

49:09.863 --> 49:13.665
and Playboy, on the cover
of Playboy, the same month.

49:13.667 --> 49:17.502
The crazy thing is, so, the gateway
to porn for me was Playboy.

49:17.504 --> 49:22.107
How could I not get into the business? I
was introduced in the most incredible way.

49:22.109 --> 49:27.178
And, I mean, I didn't have to do a six guy
bukkake, right? It was like I went to Playboy.

49:27.180 --> 49:32.417
If some girls aren't even college educated,
this is a dream. I had a college degree

49:32.419 --> 49:36.423
and I wasn't making even a quarter of the
money, so where was I going to continue?

49:38.125 --> 49:42.895
My first crush in porn
was Janine Lindemulder.

49:42.897 --> 49:49.134
And I'll always remember she wore jeans,
blue jeans and a white tank top with no bra.

49:49.136 --> 49:52.404
She was smiling so big
and she came over and hugged me.

49:52.406 --> 49:57.576
And I was like: "This is... This is where
I need to be. This is it. I'm... I'm in."

49:57.578 --> 50:01.847
I feel like this is a fantasy
and I'm making it come true.

50:01.849 --> 50:07.120
Yeah, even better if you took off
that part. That... The top bra thing.

50:09.657 --> 50:14.192
[Tera] I realized if I'm getting into
this, I have to make it worth my while.

50:14.194 --> 50:20.733
Once you've had a dick in your mouth, you can
never go back. You can't un-ring the bell.

50:20.735 --> 50:23.636
Tera Patrick and the flesh.

50:23.638 --> 50:26.106
[sound of air blasts]

50:29.544 --> 50:31.379
There goes anonymity.

50:33.381 --> 50:36.616
In a way, I think that
early on in my career,

50:36.618 --> 50:41.721
I explored a lot of my sexualities.
I think anal was the hardest thing.

50:41.723 --> 50:45.658
I can't believe I whispered that <i>anal,</i> you
know, I mean it was taboo a little bit.

50:45.660 --> 50:51.263
I mean it was kind of like: "Okay,
now she's gonna do anal." You know.

50:51.265 --> 50:56.369
Actually, for me, what was a big
deal was I never did girl-girl.

50:56.371 --> 50:59.305
It's hot in here. Could we take
off all our clothes? My God.

50:59.307 --> 51:02.908
So when I did my first
girl-girl scene in 2003,

51:02.910 --> 51:06.746
and of course, it was with a
really beautiful woman, Savannah,

51:06.748 --> 51:10.449
with Vivian,
for Tera, Tera, Tera.

51:10.451 --> 51:13.452
Tera, Tera, Tera.

51:13.454 --> 51:16.355
It was a great experience
for me, but I was ready.

51:16.357 --> 51:20.593
I never did anything
that I didn't want to do. Ever.

51:20.595 --> 51:23.262
We're out and open with what we do.
I've always said,

51:23.264 --> 51:25.866
why do you think I wasn't in the
mainstream? I have my own production.

51:25.868 --> 51:30.269
You know, I'm making my own money.
I'm doing what I want to do.

51:30.271 --> 51:34.573
I don't want to do mainstream. I like
sucking dick. That's what I'm famous for.

51:34.575 --> 51:40.747
I didn't cure cancer. You know what I mean?
I... I'm famous for being Tera Patrick.

51:40.749 --> 51:47.586
And I can remember being in con. And I was on
the red carpet too, and I had a police escort.

51:47.588 --> 51:51.323
And people, they knew me,
they were waiting for pictures.

51:51.325 --> 51:54.393
They were waiting, and I said,
they've all seen my pussy.

51:54.395 --> 51:56.565
My pussy made it to Europe.

51:59.568 --> 52:04.938
So how I ended up with Teravision,
and on my own in the porn business

52:04.940 --> 52:07.641
starting from 2003

52:07.643 --> 52:12.681
until I retired in 2009, was,
uh, I became a feature dancer.

52:18.053 --> 52:22.923
And this was what bankrolled my company.
I went on the road as a feature dancer

52:22.925 --> 52:27.427
where we performed, uh, striptease
shows in clubs. We made money,

52:27.429 --> 52:30.797
and I would go home and use
that money to fund my movies.

52:30.799 --> 52:33.867
The sales from my movies,
half went into living,

52:33.869 --> 52:35.637
the other half
went into savings.

52:37.005 --> 52:41.007
We made a lot more
money per movie, per scene.

52:41.009 --> 52:43.877
A lot of us got residuals,
a lot of us owned our content,

52:43.879 --> 52:48.348
owned our company. We had many
ways to exploit our revenue.

52:48.350 --> 52:54.521
I look at my body of work and Teravision,
my website, I made beautiful work.

52:54.523 --> 52:57.858
I mean, listen, we're not shooting
Othello, you know, you...

52:57.860 --> 53:00.494
The dialogue doesn't have to be
perfect, get the cock in the mouth,

53:00.496 --> 53:02.662
the cum shot on the face
and we're good.

53:02.664 --> 53:05.932
So, is there anything else
I can get you, guys?

53:05.934 --> 53:08.035
I can't think of anything.

53:08.037 --> 53:10.739
Yeah, what in the world could
we possibly want after that?

53:16.712 --> 53:22.783
The opportunity to work in Italy
came up. And I said, Italy,

53:22.785 --> 53:27.487
this is the most beautiful country in
the world. The best food, wine. I mean,

53:27.489 --> 53:29.056
yeah, I'm gone.
I'm going.

53:29.058 --> 53:31.658
Anything
to do with food or money

53:31.660 --> 53:35.997
is what I learned first in Italian because
you have to eat and you have to get paid.

53:35.999 --> 53:38.099
And so the first phrase
I learned was

53:38.101 --> 53:40.837
[in Italian]
Pay me now.

53:47.777 --> 53:52.747
[Tera] I signed a contract to do feature
shows. My very first feature show,

53:52.749 --> 53:57.051
my now husband Alberto
had come from day one.

53:57.053 --> 53:59.120
Of course,
I wanted to sit on his face,

53:59.122 --> 54:01.789
you know, and this beautiful
Italian accent, and...

54:01.791 --> 54:04.158
But he fascinated me.

54:04.160 --> 54:09.630
This is an open-minded man, I
think to even jump in the water

54:09.632 --> 54:13.770
and see what it would be like to swim with
me for a while. Yeah, it takes balls.

54:15.138 --> 54:20.608
[whispering] I think I feel this
one. Watch y'all.

54:20.610 --> 54:23.544
Okay. Here we go.

54:23.546 --> 54:25.847
[Tera] I love the business.
I love my life now.

54:25.849 --> 54:28.683
I'm just gonna...
I'm gonna keep camming.

54:28.685 --> 54:32.787
I'm gonna keep my websites, I'm gonna
keep featuring. I'm never gonna stop.

54:32.789 --> 54:38.593
I'm a pervert. I'm never gonna stop
dancing and performing on stage.

54:38.595 --> 54:44.599
And so, maybe that's when it's gonna end,
maybe that's when porn is gonna end.

54:44.601 --> 54:46.801
When they stop throwing
the dollars. I hope not.

54:46.803 --> 54:49.472
Guys, come to
Cheerleaders next month.

54:52.508 --> 54:56.477
I don't know if the analogy is the
same, but I feel like it's almost like

54:56.479 --> 55:01.917
being a professional athlete. You have a
few good years, in my opinion, physically,

55:01.919 --> 55:06.922
to do what you want. To make
your mark. To make your splash.

55:06.924 --> 55:10.426
And then, I wanted
to go out gracefully.

55:11.728 --> 55:15.496
This was something that early on I
said: "I can't do this till I'm 50."

55:15.498 --> 55:20.936
And I don't want to but, I am so
grateful, and I always will be

55:20.938 --> 55:24.672
because I've been
retired for 10 years

55:24.674 --> 55:28.243
and I still sell in webcam.

55:28.245 --> 55:32.080
And I have thousands
of website members.

55:32.082 --> 55:37.019
My life in the adult business has not
resulted in anything negative for me.

55:37.021 --> 55:42.557
Have I hit some speed bumps? Had a lawsuit?
Fucked the wrong guy a few times? Sure!

55:42.559 --> 55:47.229
But I'm not damaged to a point
where I'm bankrupt, destitute,

55:47.231 --> 55:50.901
and trying to figure out: "What
do I want to do with my life?"

56:00.244 --> 56:03.979
It's a movie industry combine
with sex. Nothing more.

56:03.981 --> 56:07.149
It is what you make of it.
It's an artistic medium

56:07.151 --> 56:11.753
that is meant to draw out a
reaction from people, turned on,

56:11.755 --> 56:13.789
angry, whatever it is,
it's working.

56:13.791 --> 56:18.760
I really unlocked
a piece of my sexuality

56:18.762 --> 56:23.765
that, uhm... That was
hidden before I got here,

56:23.767 --> 56:27.769
and porn really helped open it up.
And it's built me confidence.

56:27.771 --> 56:31.773
It's different that where you should
learn how to have sex, the same way

56:31.775 --> 56:35.144
that you wouldn't watch
a waste crapping movie,

56:35.146 --> 56:40.015
and then feel like you have to go
slaughter a teenager in a camp

56:40.017 --> 56:43.119
in summer wearing a hockey mask.
You know what I mean?

56:43.121 --> 56:44.022
So specific.

56:53.797 --> 56:55.066
Now so, what should
we talk about?

57:00.338 --> 57:03.206
[laughs]

57:03.208 --> 57:05.108
Nina gave me
one of the best compliments

57:05.110 --> 57:07.678
when I was put into the
whole famous Herschel Savage.

57:08.947 --> 57:12.749
"Steel wrapped in skin,
that was his cock." I love that.

57:12.751 --> 57:14.683
[interviewer]
That's an unbelievably...

57:14.685 --> 57:17.619
That's a great compliment coming
from Nina Hartley. Come on.

57:17.621 --> 57:21.257
Can you believe it? Sometimes,
horses have wings, baby.

57:21.259 --> 57:25.828
You know, like I would've taken the next
Grinch, but I was happy with what I had.

57:25.830 --> 57:29.732
But I never competed with anybody. I
was not one of those guys, you know.

57:29.734 --> 57:36.139
I had literally had the young porn stars
come on the set, and tell me shit like:

57:36.141 --> 57:41.277
"I could cum eight times in a day. I got a
nine-inch dick." I said: "Nice to meet you.

57:41.279 --> 57:44.747
Get the fuck out of my face." No, I didn't
say that, but still, I mean, you know,

57:44.749 --> 57:46.749
people try to promote
themselves as you know,

57:46.751 --> 57:49.185
give me a break, man.
Just say hello.

57:49.187 --> 57:52.622
I'm looking for the manager, you
must be him. What's your name?

57:52.624 --> 57:56.993
- You're the manager, right?
- Uhm, yeah, hi.

57:56.995 --> 58:02.967
- What's your name?
- Uh, Boom, uh... Bada Boom.

58:05.670 --> 58:08.307
[interviewer] How often did
you actually had an orgasm?

58:10.108 --> 58:15.812
On film? Are you asking me how often I had
an orgasm on film? Is that a real question?

58:15.814 --> 58:17.082
[interviewer] Versus faking.

58:18.417 --> 58:22.085
That's my job, it's to have an
orgasm, to maintain an erection,

58:22.087 --> 58:25.922
get the footage,
and... have an orgasm, cum.

58:25.924 --> 58:28.724
[interviewer] A lot of people,
like Tera said she'd fake it.

58:28.726 --> 58:33.230
Well, women can fake it. I mean, most women
in the business probably aren't cumming.

58:33.232 --> 58:37.767
I mean that's... But they don't have to,
guys have to. We're doing real work.

58:37.769 --> 58:41.371
I mean, It's hard to believe having
an orgasm on camera is work,

58:41.373 --> 58:45.175
but there's some
physical, uh strain to it.

58:45.177 --> 58:49.113
But no, guys don't,
guys don't like... I mean yeah:

58:49.115 --> 58:54.053
"Herschel, We need you to fuck three girls
today, but please don't cum. Okay, no problem."

58:55.121 --> 58:59.056
I don't care how you do it, but you
have got to make this girl cum,

58:59.058 --> 59:04.328
and when she does, I want you to have this
beaker ready and catch every single drop.

59:04.330 --> 59:07.030
[interviewer] And to reiterate nobody
ever told you to hold your orgasm

59:07.032 --> 59:11.170
for a couple of days
to make it more prodigious?

59:12.838 --> 59:14.371
Ah... no.

59:14.373 --> 59:17.074
[laughs]
No one ever asks me to

59:17.076 --> 59:19.943
hold off on cumming for
a couple of days

59:19.945 --> 59:24.848
so I could have a prodigious ejaculate.
No, no one ever did that.

59:24.850 --> 59:30.020
They assume that you... All men in the business
have these amazing powers and abilities,

59:30.022 --> 59:32.158
but no we don't.
No, no one ever asks that.

59:34.760 --> 59:40.766
I have never had a sexual relationship
with any of the White House interns.

59:44.303 --> 59:49.273
[Herschel] I played Bill Clinton
in a scene with Monica Lewinsky.

59:49.275 --> 59:53.311
Monica was played by Asha,
the beautiful Asha.

59:53.313 --> 59:58.048
And I must say, I mean I got a blowjob under
the desk while I'm being interviewed on camera

59:58.050 --> 01:00:01.486
as Bill Clinton, and she was...
She just didn't stop.

01:00:01.488 --> 01:00:03.321
When they cut the camera
she kept blowing me.

01:00:03.323 --> 01:00:07.124
She was the best.
It's amazing blowjob, so great.

01:00:07.126 --> 01:00:10.027
Just send me the dry cleaning
charge, honey.

01:00:10.029 --> 01:00:12.896
- What am I doing? Straight?
- [interviwer] Uh, well you know, freeway.

01:00:12.898 --> 01:00:15.933
- West?
- Ah, you're gonna go East. We're gonna go back towards the house.

01:00:15.935 --> 01:00:19.070
Alright. I'm having a good time. I just want
to let you know you're doing a good job.

01:00:19.072 --> 01:00:22.007
- I do. I hope you're enjoying the...
- Are you having a good time?

01:00:25.045 --> 01:00:27.345
[Herschel] I think, generally
speaking, my scenes are hot,

01:00:27.347 --> 01:00:29.113
because of the connection
I have with the women.

01:00:29.115 --> 01:00:33.453
It's hot. It's hot stuff, man.
I think, anyway.

01:00:38.992 --> 01:00:42.527
I'd really like to finish
those planter boxes tomorrow.

01:00:42.529 --> 01:00:46.130
I was never really kinky.
I was more of a romantic.

01:00:46.132 --> 01:00:50.835
I mean, I just loved kissing and... For
me, it was like a romantic adventure.

01:00:50.837 --> 01:00:54.472
I mean, you had to still make
it hot, but for the most part

01:00:54.474 --> 01:00:58.543
those are private intense
connections with that woman.

01:00:58.545 --> 01:01:03.181
So, when I... When I watch a scene that I'm
in, I'm reliving that moment with that woman

01:01:03.183 --> 01:01:06.319
'cause that was so significant
to me, and so strong!

01:01:07.587 --> 01:01:13.291
- Stay a while. Talk.
- Honey, if I stay, we won't be talking.

01:01:13.293 --> 01:01:16.261
It wasn't even performing,
It wasn't performing for me,

01:01:16.263 --> 01:01:20.898
it was like, I was, I was, I was with...
I was with somebody.

01:01:20.900 --> 01:01:25.103
It was like, it was like
a universal snuggle, man.

01:01:25.105 --> 01:01:28.108
It was great. I'm with you, you know.
It's fucking great.

01:01:31.278 --> 01:01:35.481
You know you really beautiful?
I mean really attractive.

01:01:35.483 --> 01:01:40.552
I quit the first time in '87.
Came back in '97.

01:01:40.554 --> 01:01:46.558
And, and the difference between women from
the '80s to the '90s, was unbelievable.

01:01:46.560 --> 01:01:51.497
It was like model quality young women, I
mean, you know. I mean, it was just like...

01:01:51.499 --> 01:01:54.866
I was selling videotape
during my retirement period

01:01:54.868 --> 01:01:58.138
realizing I'm never gonna have
sex with this woman, you know.

01:02:01.375 --> 01:02:04.376
- Who're they gonna jump...
- Nice ass.

01:02:04.378 --> 01:02:07.546
- Great eye stuff. You still got it.
- I do.

01:02:07.548 --> 01:02:10.149
- You look really great.
- Thank you.

01:02:10.151 --> 01:02:14.388
Light shining behind your head.
You look like, like an angel.

01:02:17.992 --> 01:02:22.328
As we can see in the normal
entertainment industry.

01:02:22.330 --> 01:02:27.232
How at risk women are to p...
men especially

01:02:27.234 --> 01:02:30.035
who use their power
to take advantage of them.

01:02:30.037 --> 01:02:33.272
Every woman is hit on whether they're
in the adult industry, or not.

01:02:33.274 --> 01:02:37.376
Then certainly, it's going to be
more likely if they're encountering

01:02:37.378 --> 01:02:42.147
many of the pigs to populate this industry.
"Oh, you wanna work?" You know it's like:

01:02:42.149 --> 01:02:45.017
"Give me a blow..." I mean, it's like,
I'm gonna be blowing somebody, anyway,

01:02:45.019 --> 01:02:47.052
and you're gonna be doing this,
anyway. I just want to see how

01:02:47.054 --> 01:02:49.254
you all are, you know.
It's bullshit.

01:02:49.256 --> 01:02:53.158
Everyone becomes objectified. And
you don't see a woman as a person

01:02:53.160 --> 01:02:57.062
and that's a sickness. When
you're only dealing with the sex

01:02:57.064 --> 01:03:00.501
and the need of that. It's...
You're an empty vessel.

01:03:04.606 --> 01:03:09.375
So, massage parlors scene. And
I come in and I play the role

01:03:09.377 --> 01:03:13.278
of a guy who's coming in for
a massage. She just pulling...

01:03:13.280 --> 01:03:15.280
We don't actually
have intercourse.

01:03:15.282 --> 01:03:19.452
She gives me a shower,
masturbates me and blows me.

01:03:19.454 --> 01:03:23.088
One of my... one of the hottest scenes
ever... I masturbate to that scene.

01:03:23.090 --> 01:03:25.525
I'm sorry, I have to have
some kind of life.

01:03:25.527 --> 01:03:29.598
Anyway, that's a hot scene.
Check that one out.

01:03:32.467 --> 01:03:37.670
As I spoke of earlier, this is the
scene I just love to watch called

01:03:37.672 --> 01:03:42.709
soapy massage. And I am the shy
massage parlor customer

01:03:42.711 --> 01:03:48.415
coming for a normal everyday massage.
But She is starting to grip my thigh.

01:03:48.417 --> 01:03:53.051
And she's just, I mean...
Can you see this?

01:03:53.053 --> 01:03:55.455
I'm reacting in horror.
"Oh, my God, what are you doing?

01:03:55.457 --> 01:03:57.624
Oh, no,
I shouldn't be doing this.

01:03:57.626 --> 01:04:01.327
I'm just here to have my muscles
workout." My shirt's off,

01:04:01.329 --> 01:04:05.265
I shouldn't be shocked anymore. What I should
be shocked is that I wasn't going to the gym

01:04:05.267 --> 01:04:08.001
for three years, that's
what I should be shocked about.

01:04:08.003 --> 01:04:10.437
But here we go. You know,
I kind of feel embarrassed

01:04:10.439 --> 01:04:14.174
being with you people and doing an
interview, and now my cock is coming out.

01:04:14.176 --> 01:04:20.246
You know, so it's almost like, you know...
It's like forcing your close friend Bob,

01:04:20.248 --> 01:04:23.251
to watch your dick getting sucked.
It's weird. Kind of weird.

01:04:25.320 --> 01:04:29.055
People have been against me from
day one. Do you, do you see me?

01:04:29.057 --> 01:04:33.293
Here I stand, go ahead. Try it,
I dare you. That's the thing

01:04:33.295 --> 01:04:37.430
that this industry has taught me.
I have balls. Let me tell you.

01:04:37.432 --> 01:04:41.601
And I'm very proud of my big balls.
Because you know what, I know who I am.

01:04:41.603 --> 01:04:44.137
To be in adult entertainment
doesn't have to be a stigma.

01:04:44.139 --> 01:04:48.274
It doesn't have to be a dark seedy
evil place. I'm very proud of myself.

01:04:48.276 --> 01:04:52.045
I'm honest about what I do. Who I am
and how it is when you're with me.

01:04:52.047 --> 01:04:53.747
Hopefully, you want to
come along for the ride.

01:04:53.749 --> 01:04:56.182
And If not, then there's
another bus or train

01:04:56.184 --> 01:04:59.988
or something down the way you can hop
on, but hopping on me is always fun.

01:05:02.357 --> 01:05:05.559
[Jenteal] I wanted to build
a Jenteal-pyre.

01:05:05.561 --> 01:05:09.295
[moaning and panting
in the background]

01:05:09.297 --> 01:05:13.066
I wanted to build
an empire of my own.

01:05:13.068 --> 01:05:16.739
My goal was to have a million dollars in the
bank free and clear by the time I hit 30.

01:05:18.374 --> 01:05:20.674
[interviewer] <i>All right. Can I,
first of all, I want to know,</i>

01:05:20.676 --> 01:05:22.645
<i>what makes you do videos?
How come you're here?</i>

01:05:26.248 --> 01:05:31.619
My boyfriend and I were very
interested in watching porn.

01:05:31.621 --> 01:05:33.489
I was very interested in girls.

01:05:35.090 --> 01:05:39.393
I had a huge crush on Janine. She was one
of the girls that we always looked for

01:05:39.395 --> 01:05:42.530
when we went to the adult bookstore. You
know, it's always kind of in the back

01:05:42.532 --> 01:05:45.566
of my mind what
would that be like.

01:05:45.568 --> 01:05:49.169
It's easy.
You just do what you feel.

01:05:49.171 --> 01:05:51.539
Never did I think
that would come to fruition.

01:05:51.541 --> 01:05:53.142
Look what the cat dragged it.

01:05:57.480 --> 01:06:00.414
There was an ad in one
of the Berkeley school papers

01:06:00.416 --> 01:06:03.117
that was looking for
nude models. I'd seen the ad

01:06:03.119 --> 01:06:06.487
for months and months on end. And then
when I turned 18, my boyfriend was like,

01:06:06.489 --> 01:06:10.324
"You need to call that ad."
I wanted to explore that more.

01:06:10.326 --> 01:06:13.727
And he really wanted me
to explore that more.

01:06:13.729 --> 01:06:19.233
So the ad was run by a man named
Zen Burrows, who became my agent.

01:06:19.235 --> 01:06:23.203
Uh, he had a small little production
company called Wildfire Productions.

01:06:23.205 --> 01:06:27.575
And uhm, a star was born.

01:06:27.577 --> 01:06:30.444
[Interviewer] <i>Are you an exhibitionist?
Like to be watched?</i>

01:06:30.446 --> 01:06:33.882
I think that being watched
can be a turn on at one point.

01:06:33.884 --> 01:06:36.718
<i>You're being watched now.</i>
[laughter]

01:06:36.720 --> 01:06:40.222
<i>We'll be watched by several
people. Several thousand.</i>

01:06:41.390 --> 01:06:45.426
I only worked with girls in the beginning
because I didn't wanna work with guys.

01:06:45.428 --> 01:06:49.165
Like I only wanted to work with girls.
I was really curious about it.

01:06:51.568 --> 01:06:54.468
- Oh, yes.
- [moans]

01:06:54.470 --> 01:06:56.337
Good Girl.

01:06:56.339 --> 01:06:59.641
So I mean it had only been
six months, nine months maybe.

01:06:59.643 --> 01:07:02.844
Uhm, I'd worked with all of the
girls I ever wanted to work with.

01:07:02.846 --> 01:07:07.181
And Vivid had always told me when
I was on their set, uh, that

01:07:07.183 --> 01:07:10.485
if you ever want to work with men,
we will sign you to a contract.

01:07:10.487 --> 01:07:13.122
So, I wanted more money.

01:07:14.290 --> 01:07:16.524
300 dollars?

01:07:16.526 --> 01:07:20.962
And I knew that I could get a lot
more money working with guys.

01:07:20.964 --> 01:07:23.500
[music]

01:07:31.241 --> 01:07:33.644
[Jenteal] I mean being a
Vivid girl, was a huge accolade.

01:07:34.878 --> 01:07:38.380
I felt really special
that they wanted to sign me.

01:07:38.382 --> 01:07:41.983
And they reassured me that I'd have
control over who I worked with

01:07:41.985 --> 01:07:43.885
and that I could
insist on condoms.

01:07:43.887 --> 01:07:47.889
And When I signed with Vivid,
my first boy-girl scene

01:07:47.891 --> 01:07:51.559
was in <i>Dangerous Games</i> with Alex Sanders.
He was my first guy.

01:07:51.561 --> 01:07:53.664
I don't like that kind of talk.
I don't like it at all

01:07:55.699 --> 01:07:57.334
Can you believe these lines.

01:07:58.869 --> 01:08:03.738
[Jenteal] Vivid was definitely the
company to work for. It was sought after

01:08:03.740 --> 01:08:10.512
by everybody in the business. And, they sort
of, were the elite girls that felt like...

01:08:10.514 --> 01:08:13.949
you know, it was all of the classics.
It was Janine, Christie Canyon,

01:08:13.951 --> 01:08:19.288
myself, Nikki Tyler, Racquel Darrian.
Everybody wanted to be a Vivid girl.

01:08:21.358 --> 01:08:24.993
To be successful as in any business
in any industry you have to be unique

01:08:24.996 --> 01:08:28.964
and do something different. Market
yourself in a different way.

01:08:28.966 --> 01:08:32.702
Steve Hirsch was really big on
advertising in a mainstream way.

01:08:32.703 --> 01:08:35.569
And for a time,
he had us all 17 feet tall

01:08:35.572 --> 01:08:38.339
on Sunset Boulevard
right above Tower Records.

01:08:38.341 --> 01:08:41.977
And that was huge. You know, no other adult
company had done anything like that before.

01:08:41.979 --> 01:08:45.781
Vivid did so many different things in
their movies, you know, with costumes

01:08:45.783 --> 01:08:50.752
and with locations that I had a
bunch of really unique experiences.

01:08:50.755 --> 01:08:55.925
I know you don't know this yet, but...
it's a very big world out there.

01:08:55.926 --> 01:09:00.328
Over my 21st birthday, we were in Hawaii
shooting for Vivid and for Playboy.

01:09:00.330 --> 01:09:02.966
And those two movies that
I did in Hawaii were awesome.

01:09:04.368 --> 01:09:08.703
Hi, I'm Eve. The locations were
just superb. I felt really pretty.

01:09:08.706 --> 01:09:12.975
My boyfriend was really perfectly
okay with the industry.

01:09:12.977 --> 01:09:17.613
He was perfectly okay with me
working with guys in movies.

01:09:17.615 --> 01:09:23.586
I got into the business with my boyfriend.
And we got married about five years later.

01:09:23.587 --> 01:09:27.622
And then six months later,
when I got pregnant, I stopped.

01:09:27.625 --> 01:09:30.693
Everything, I stopped,
nude modeling, dancing.

01:09:30.694 --> 01:09:35.865
I'd pretty much been done with films
already. Uhm, but for me, that was it.

01:09:35.867 --> 01:09:37.568
[electronic music]

01:09:45.077 --> 01:09:47.743
I definitely knew I didn't wanna
be a part of the industry

01:09:47.745 --> 01:09:50.779
and be pregnant
or raising two children.

01:09:50.782 --> 01:09:54.517
I was born, I felt, to be
a mother first and foremost

01:09:54.519 --> 01:09:57.653
and my accomplishments
in the industry

01:09:57.655 --> 01:10:01.624
and with my business were just secondary,
but for me, being a mother was it

01:10:01.626 --> 01:10:04.060
and I didn't want to
have to juggle the two.

01:10:04.062 --> 01:10:06.897
I honestly after doing
so much in the business

01:10:06.899 --> 01:10:09.933
and being made up so glamorously
for so many years

01:10:09.935 --> 01:10:12.903
and all the travel and everything. I
just really wanted to be a basic bitch.

01:10:12.905 --> 01:10:18.074
I wanted a flat salary, I wanted to
know my hours and... and that was it.

01:10:18.076 --> 01:10:23.512
So, when I was at Trader Joe's, I hurt my
back really bad lifting some milk crates

01:10:23.514 --> 01:10:27.383
and had to have two back
surgeries, that was in 2009.

01:10:27.385 --> 01:10:30.987
And I've had this injury since
then despite the surgeries.

01:10:30.989 --> 01:10:36.993
Thank you all for coming. Uh, I really just
wanted an opportunity to, uhm, open up

01:10:36.995 --> 01:10:43.166
the discussion about the oil and share my
experience and see if you have any questions.

01:10:43.168 --> 01:10:49.139
Not that long ago a girlfriend posted something
on her Facebook page regarding CVD oil.

01:10:49.141 --> 01:10:52.642
And I'd heard that
it helps people you know,

01:10:52.644 --> 01:10:56.479
with, with... heal cancer.
I've heard that it helps with,

01:10:56.481 --> 01:11:01.418
with a lot of other illnesses and ailments.
And so I was really curious.

01:11:01.420 --> 01:11:04.754
I just knew that with my back injury,
you know, this was something that was

01:11:04.756 --> 01:11:07.123
really going to help me.
And I was very, very interested

01:11:07.125 --> 01:11:10.629
in where the business is going,
so I got involved.

01:11:13.432 --> 01:11:16.933
I don't really feel like
my past ever was...

01:11:16.935 --> 01:11:20.670
it never brought any
tumultuousness to my life.

01:11:20.672 --> 01:11:24.841
There're certain people that certainly
don't agree with it and have opinions.

01:11:24.843 --> 01:11:29.980
Uh, their opinions are their business and
they've never really been imposed on me.

01:11:29.982 --> 01:11:34.853
So I felt like I got away pretty
unscathed in that regard, actually.

01:11:36.622 --> 01:11:40.024
Just having been a fan of porn,
I would definitely say

01:11:40.026 --> 01:11:45.495
that the porn shot in the '90s was far
superior than, uh, than what is shot today.

01:11:45.497 --> 01:11:48.665
And I definitely think just
from a fan's perspective

01:11:48.667 --> 01:11:51.670
that the porn then was, was...
That was a golden era.

01:11:52.571 --> 01:11:55.672
That little honey pot of my life
in my early 20s,

01:11:55.674 --> 01:11:59.977
was really, uh... They had a lot packed into it,
though. There was a lot that I experienced,

01:11:59.979 --> 01:12:03.948
I mean, a ton. I probably lived more life
in those five years than most 50 years old

01:12:03.950 --> 01:12:05.550
have their entire life.

01:12:06.953 --> 01:12:11.024
The juice was worth the squeeze,
and I wrung that fucker dry, dude.

01:12:20.667 --> 01:12:23.267
[Jenteal] I feel like people frequently
think that I'm just a sex object,

01:12:23.269 --> 01:12:26.137
and I'm not, I'm a person.

01:12:26.139 --> 01:12:28.906
And I've literally had guys
that... I was just hanging out

01:12:28.908 --> 01:12:34.078
and they just took their dick out
expecting me to do something with it.

01:12:34.080 --> 01:12:37.515
We need to stop shaming people for
being in porn. There is no reason to

01:12:37.517 --> 01:12:41.052
shame people for being in porn. It's a
legitimate business. It's a real business.

01:12:41.054 --> 01:12:44.522
- It's a billion dollar business.
- [Romi] Everybody always says:

01:12:44.524 --> 01:12:46.991
"You're in porn, you're an adult entertainer,
people are never gonna forget it.

01:12:46.993 --> 01:12:48.259
They're gonna remember
this forever.

01:12:48.261 --> 01:12:49.894
You are a porn star for life."

01:12:49.896 --> 01:12:52.530
And I always thought:
"Well, use that

01:12:52.532 --> 01:12:55.900
and if you're going to be in adult
entertainment anyway, try to be

01:12:55.902 --> 01:12:59.070
the best version of yourself you
can be. Try to be as successful

01:12:59.072 --> 01:13:01.706
as possible. So then When you
look back on your career,

01:13:01.708 --> 01:13:03.576
you're not looking back
on it with regrets."

01:13:06.546 --> 01:13:09.547
Take a breath in, bring your
ears in line with your shoulders

01:13:09.549 --> 01:13:13.718
so your neck is in line with your spine.
That's it. Draw your shoulders back.

01:13:13.720 --> 01:13:17.621
[Romi] So, I went to this person's house and
I had one drink and after that one drink,

01:13:17.623 --> 01:13:21.059
I remember nothing, and woke up
the next morning to my IDs

01:13:21.061 --> 01:13:25.730
and a consent form on the nightstand.
And that was when I shot my first film.

01:13:25.732 --> 01:13:27.767
[piano music]

01:13:29.869 --> 01:13:33.904
[Bonnie] Every time you exhale,
watch what you can let go of more.

01:13:33.906 --> 01:13:37.810
Physical, mental, the exhalation
is a process of letting go.

01:13:40.147 --> 01:13:42.948
[thunderstorm]

01:13:42.950 --> 01:13:46.184
My mother, ah, she didn't
raise me, she left me when

01:13:46.186 --> 01:13:50.022
I was probably two months old. And
we haven't really had a relationship

01:13:50.024 --> 01:13:52.623
since then and my father was
in prison my entire life.

01:13:52.625 --> 01:13:56.828
My grandparents raised me from four
until I was you know, 16 years old.

01:13:56.830 --> 01:13:59.698
I grew up with my grandfather.
My grandfather and grandmother

01:13:59.700 --> 01:14:02.134
actually separated,
they're my mother's parents.

01:14:02.136 --> 01:14:06.038
So my grandfather raised me. I grew
up at the horse track with him,

01:14:06.040 --> 01:14:08.642
I grew up just in the country.

01:14:10.077 --> 01:14:14.212
When I was 13, I lost my virginity to
a boyfriend and we were in school.

01:14:14.214 --> 01:14:17.349
He was... I was in eighth grade,
he was in seventh grade.

01:14:17.351 --> 01:14:20.652
And my best friend went to
church and told all of my family

01:14:20.654 --> 01:14:24.356
that I lost my virginity. And then
the next day, I went to school

01:14:24.358 --> 01:14:30.128
to beat up my best friend for, you know,
that issue and was then removed from school

01:14:30.130 --> 01:14:35.000
and kicked out of school. And that was what
perpetuated me leaving school in eighth grade.

01:14:35.002 --> 01:14:38.070
And once that all had happened
where I lost my virginity

01:14:38.072 --> 01:14:41.106
and moved out from my grandmother's
back into my grandfather's,

01:14:41.108 --> 01:14:44.410
I started tattooing myself.
This is a 13-hour tattoo,

01:14:44.412 --> 01:14:45.577
I got it when I was 15.

01:14:45.579 --> 01:14:47.746
My back, I kinda wanted
to do like a freak show thing

01:14:47.748 --> 01:14:50.015
because it's... you know,
we're all freaks

01:14:50.017 --> 01:14:52.050
Sinatra's everywhere and I have
to carry him with me everywhere.

01:14:52.052 --> 01:14:56.154
I did this [indistinct]
and I named her Bonnie Rotten.

01:14:56.156 --> 01:15:00.125
And I ended up being me.

01:15:00.127 --> 01:15:03.931
Very quickly, I was very heavily
tattooed by the time I was about 17.

01:15:05.833 --> 01:15:08.800
I started doing car shows,
horror shows,

01:15:08.802 --> 01:15:12.438
different expos in the Midwest.
And that kind of like started

01:15:12.440 --> 01:15:14.942
my modeling career
and I invented Bonnie Rotten.

01:15:16.077 --> 01:15:20.745
I'm 21 years old, I don't need my mommy
and daddy worrying about me. Thanks.

01:15:20.747 --> 01:15:25.817
You know what? I think you're
involved in some bad stuff.

01:15:25.819 --> 01:15:30.289
Bad stuff like what?
[screaming]

01:15:30.291 --> 01:15:33.692
Fuck. You're a fucking cunt.

01:15:33.694 --> 01:15:38.131
The genre of horror for me was so
important. It was almost like a fantasy,

01:15:38.133 --> 01:15:40.867
even though it was horror
kind of like crazy and scary,

01:15:40.869 --> 01:15:44.036
it still was that fantasy world
for me that I could really enjoy,

01:15:44.038 --> 01:15:45.271
just like people do with porn.

01:15:45.273 --> 01:15:47.840
[rock and roll music]

01:15:47.842 --> 01:15:49.210
[thunderstorm]

01:15:50.778 --> 01:15:53.980
My first visit to California happened
because I was working on Horror Expo.

01:15:53.982 --> 01:15:57.383
And they had a pageant for a magazine
and I competed in the pageant.

01:15:57.385 --> 01:16:00.453
And I won the pageant. So the prize
was like to fly off to California

01:16:00.455 --> 01:16:03.122
and shoot this
layout for a magazine.

01:16:03.124 --> 01:16:07.426
So I did it and came out here,
shot the magazine and kind of met

01:16:07.428 --> 01:16:11.864
some connections in the porn industry.
So, I'd actually met someone that was on

01:16:11.866 --> 01:16:15.735
a podcast at the friend's that I was
staying at while I was in town.

01:16:15.737 --> 01:16:19.506
So I went to this person's house and I
had one drink. And after that one drink,

01:16:19.508 --> 01:16:20.708
I remember nothing.

01:16:23.144 --> 01:16:25.813
[Bonnie] And that was
when I shot my first film.

01:16:30.486 --> 01:16:33.355
You look at him,
he has the devil in his soul.

01:16:34.289 --> 01:16:35.823
I don't think that
about most people.

01:16:40.028 --> 01:16:43.863
Scary, very scary. But, he was the
only person that I encountered

01:16:43.865 --> 01:16:46.366
in the business
that was like that. After that,

01:16:46.368 --> 01:16:49.771
I had the best experiences
that I could possibly have.

01:16:52.174 --> 01:16:55.875
So when I came into the industry, I was
told by the bigger companies, like:

01:16:55.877 --> 01:16:58.978
"We can't shoot you. You have too many
tattoos. We don't know what to do with you."

01:16:58.980 --> 01:17:03.483
So, I was introduced to someone at
a company called New Sensations.

01:17:03.485 --> 01:17:07.054
And because of them, they opened
the gate for tattooed girls

01:17:07.056 --> 01:17:09.225
to be accepted into
mainstream porn companies.

01:17:11.493 --> 01:17:14.894
I was accepted
with that movie, <i>Meet Bonnie.</i>

01:17:14.896 --> 01:17:21.068
Hi, my name is Bonnie Rotten. I'm 19.
I just turned 19 three weeks ago.

01:17:21.070 --> 01:17:24.938
It was nominated for a bunch of awards
the first year I was in in the business.

01:17:24.940 --> 01:17:27.407
I was nominated for Best New
Starlet, like three months in.

01:17:27.409 --> 01:17:31.044
[interviewer] <i>How many awards are you nominated for tonight?</i>
- Uh 14.

01:17:31.046 --> 01:17:33.814
<i>The winner is, Bonnie Rotten.</i>

01:17:33.816 --> 01:17:35.582
[people cheering]

01:17:35.584 --> 01:17:38.485
[Bonnie] And then after that,
that was it. Everybody shot me,

01:17:38.487 --> 01:17:42.022
everybody started hiring me. Everybody
started putting me on box covers.

01:17:42.024 --> 01:17:44.391
And then it kinda just
took off from there.

01:17:44.393 --> 01:17:48.097
- <i>Rambo.</i>
- Colonel, I didn't expect to see you here.

01:17:49.932 --> 01:17:52.768
Rambo, I need you to abort this
mission immediately, soldier.

01:17:54.503 --> 01:18:00.073
[Bonnie] So, I was shooting 10 to 15 times a
month, featuring 1-2... 1-3 weekends a month.

01:18:00.075 --> 01:18:06.313
[announcer] <i>Internationally famous,
Bonnie Rotten, in the building.</i>

01:18:06.315 --> 01:18:08.516
I got to experience a lot.

01:18:08.518 --> 01:18:10.585
- [reporter] <i>Bonnie, how you doing?</i>
- I'm awesome. How are you?

01:18:10.587 --> 01:18:12.986
<i>We're doing great. This is hard, I
don't know where to put my eyes.</i>

01:18:12.988 --> 01:18:13.954
Right here.

01:18:13.956 --> 01:18:15.090
[people cheering]

01:18:19.362 --> 01:18:21.962
One of my most favorite parts of my
career, was when I got to travel

01:18:21.964 --> 01:18:25.065
to Switzerland and Germany. And I
did like basically a world tour.

01:18:25.067 --> 01:18:27.901
I can't go to sleep because I'm excited.
And I just want to see everything.

01:18:27.903 --> 01:18:30.037
And I want to go eat
and I want to eat all the food,

01:18:30.039 --> 01:18:32.373
and I want to try everything.
I want to do everything.

01:18:32.375 --> 01:18:35.909
Where I started in South Africa
and did something

01:18:35.911 --> 01:18:37.813
called SexPo in Johannesburg.

01:18:39.416 --> 01:18:44.385
Went from there to Switzerland to
shoot a movie called <i>Roller Girl</i>.

01:18:44.387 --> 01:18:47.622
And Went to Hungary
to shoot with Rocco Siffredi.

01:18:47.624 --> 01:18:51.127
And we did <i>Bonnie VS Rocco,</i>
which was insane.

01:18:52.195 --> 01:18:57.432
And it was the best time of my life. I got
a couple of tattoos, the Berlin bear,

01:18:57.434 --> 01:19:02.505
and the Swiss flag
and the bull from Barcelona.

01:19:04.240 --> 01:19:07.975
I really wanted to make porn art. You
know, 'cause I was shooting so much,

01:19:07.977 --> 01:19:10.345
and I was always involved in
these things. And I was like:

01:19:10.347 --> 01:19:13.514
"These guys, like they bring us in their,
you know their apartment or whatever.

01:19:13.516 --> 01:19:15.283
And they have a shoot on
their couch, in these mansions.

01:19:15.285 --> 01:19:18.419
But these could be so cool."

01:19:18.421 --> 01:19:20.988
Like I have all these ideas.
Fuck it, I'm going to do it.

01:19:20.990 --> 01:19:23.159
I put together
Anal Candy Disco Chicks.

01:19:24.527 --> 01:19:27.063
Anal Candy Disco Chicks,
Can you get a picture?

01:19:30.166 --> 01:19:34.335
Afros, buckets
of gumballs, it was insane.

01:19:34.337 --> 01:19:39.440
And then after that, I directed <i>Cape Fear.</i>
And I also starred in it as Robert De Niro.

01:19:39.442 --> 01:19:43.411
[The people call Samantha (indistinct]. Do you
swear to tell the truth, the whole truth

01:19:43.413 --> 01:19:45.614
and nothing but the truth?
God help you all soul.

01:19:45.616 --> 01:19:49.117
While using my friend's boat
in Marina del Rey,

01:19:49.119 --> 01:19:51.620
and trying to make sure
that none of the mahogany

01:19:51.622 --> 01:19:55.123
and nothing was like messed up
by the crew. It was intense.

01:19:55.125 --> 01:19:57.994
I made zero money.
I lost money, but it was fun.

01:19:59.028 --> 01:20:00.696
[gunshot]
[scream]

01:20:00.698 --> 01:20:03.965
Yeah, and I learned, OK,
this is crazy and this is fun.

01:20:03.967 --> 01:20:06.535
But you know, people
kinda want simpler stuff,

01:20:06.537 --> 01:20:09.371
so, let's kind of dumb down production
and give them what they want.

01:20:09.373 --> 01:20:11.107
[rock and roll music]

01:20:12.576 --> 01:20:15.209
The thing about the industry,
is you're 18 years old

01:20:15.211 --> 01:20:18.212
and you're making 30-40 grand a
month. You don't know what to do

01:20:18.214 --> 01:20:20.982
with that money
at 18 years old. It's insane.

01:20:20.984 --> 01:20:24.420
So, that money is very short lived and
you're not taught what to do with it.

01:20:24.422 --> 01:20:28.557
But luckily, I did start a sex
toy company that I owned myself.

01:20:28.559 --> 01:20:33.228
One of the coolest things was these
action figures and they fashioned

01:20:33.230 --> 01:20:37.699
an action figure from every inch of
your body. It is completely insane.

01:20:37.701 --> 01:20:43.205
Every detail, every tattoo, every curl in
my hair showed up on this little doll.

01:20:43.207 --> 01:20:45.774
And we started selling them online
and they were doing really great.

01:20:45.776 --> 01:20:48.945
And people had like little Bonnie
figurines, and they could have big ones.

01:20:51.415 --> 01:20:55.484
When I left the industry, I'd actually met my
second husband who I had my daughter with.

01:20:55.486 --> 01:20:58.086
You know, I was
kind of looking for an out.

01:20:58.088 --> 01:21:00.722
Because I won Performer
of the Year the year before.

01:21:00.724 --> 01:21:05.027
I had to outperform myself, because
if you know anything about my films,

01:21:05.029 --> 01:21:09.164
like always did the craziest stuff, and there
was really nothing more than I could do

01:21:09.166 --> 01:21:12.601
that was any crazier than what
I was doing without it being

01:21:12.603 --> 01:21:14.371
a circus act
or me not enjoying it.

01:21:17.341 --> 01:21:21.276
I like to carry myself a certain way, because
I know that as soon as I walk into a room

01:21:21.278 --> 01:21:25.647
I'm looked at a certain way. Even with the
moms at school, like I don't like for them

01:21:25.649 --> 01:21:29.819
to get to know me too much because I don't
like to lie about my past or who I was.

01:21:29.821 --> 01:21:32.822
And I don't want to compromise
my daughter's life

01:21:32.824 --> 01:21:36.492
for her safety or her well-being
with her friends at school

01:21:36.494 --> 01:21:40.264
because of my past and what
the parents think of me.

01:21:42.399 --> 01:21:48.070
I want for her to have
the easiest, safest,

01:21:48.072 --> 01:21:50.374
structured life
that she can possibly have.

01:21:53.512 --> 01:21:56.546
There has been some talk about
like me returning to the industry,

01:21:56.548 --> 01:21:59.616
but because of my daughter,
I don't think that I would.

01:21:59.618 --> 01:22:03.085
Just because I want to be able to say
that I walked away when I had her

01:22:03.087 --> 01:22:07.490
- and didn't have to return.
- [yoga teacher] Exhale, cobra.

01:22:07.492 --> 01:22:11.594
- Low down, inhale, cobra.
- [Bonnie] I'm very sensitive when it comes to emotions

01:22:11.596 --> 01:22:14.196
and things like that, because of the
things that have happened to me,

01:22:14.198 --> 01:22:15.732
abandonment, those things.

01:22:15.734 --> 01:22:18.635
I'm... I really don't want
her to ever feel that way.

01:22:18.637 --> 01:22:20.537
So, I'm just
very hands-on with her

01:22:20.539 --> 01:22:23.073
and very attentive
and she's my role.

01:22:26.678 --> 01:22:32.815
I was a very extreme, you know, tattooed
hardcore girl when I performed.

01:22:32.817 --> 01:22:37.854
But In my life, I'm a very sweet, loving,
generous person and most people wouldn't think

01:22:37.856 --> 01:22:40.325
that about me at all.
Just by looking at me.

01:22:41.493 --> 01:22:44.827
Don't ever judge a book by its cover.
You never know who that person may be

01:22:44.829 --> 01:22:48.533
on the inside and you never know
where that person may take you.

01:22:54.272 --> 01:22:55.674
[instrumental music]

01:23:00.812 --> 01:23:07.250
[Luc] You need to realize that what goes
on in the adult industry, is created

01:23:07.252 --> 01:23:10.687
for your entertainment.
It's not reality.

01:23:10.689 --> 01:23:15.558
[model] Oh, help me out.
Don't go in. Like, yeah.

01:23:15.560 --> 01:23:20.630
[Luc] Reality is bumping up
against people. It's having sex.

01:23:20.632 --> 01:23:26.336
It's feeling that moment of
connection between two people.

01:23:26.338 --> 01:23:27.707
Right.

01:23:29.374 --> 01:23:36.379
The digital world can be very, very isolating
and dividing if we allow it to be.

01:23:36.381 --> 01:23:40.316
[Alex] Yeah, what's the solution though?
It's like we just need

01:23:40.318 --> 01:23:45.456
to make better choices. Let's choose
to kiss and hug instead of...

01:23:45.458 --> 01:23:46.892
[giggles]

01:23:47.793 --> 01:23:49.560
Well, and turn it off.

01:23:49.562 --> 01:23:52.195
- Or turn it on.
- It should be turned off and on.

01:23:52.197 --> 01:23:53.699
- On.
- [both laughing]

01:23:58.738 --> 01:24:00.706
[rock music]

01:24:00.708 --> 01:24:05.708
