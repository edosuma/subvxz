male announcer:
In the criminal justice system,

00:04.072 --> 00:05.606
sexually based offenses

00:05.606 --> 00:06.974
are considered
especially heinous.

00:06.974 --> 00:09.077
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:09.077 --> 00:10.978
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:10.978 --> 00:12.446
are members of an elite squad

00:12.446 --> 00:14.582
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:14.582 --> 00:17.251
These are their stories.

00:17.251 --> 00:20.854
- Yay.
- Oh, sweet boy.

00:20.854 --> 00:22.190
- Good job.
- How old is he?

00:22.190 --> 00:23.791
- He is almost two.

00:23.791 --> 00:25.859
Oh, nice.
On your stomach.

00:25.859 --> 00:27.195
- Is he your only?

00:27.195 --> 00:28.929
- Um, for now.

00:28.929 --> 00:30.364
- Well, let me
tell you something.

00:30.364 --> 00:32.766
Enjoy it, because I thought
it was tough with one,

00:32.766 --> 00:34.768
and then I had
my second child.

00:34.768 --> 00:36.470
I have a 14-year-old son.
- Wow.

00:36.470 --> 00:39.006
- Yeah. I mean,
little kids, little problems,

00:39.006 --> 00:40.608
but, honey, big kids--

00:40.608 --> 00:43.444
- Big problems.
- Ha! You know it.

00:43.444 --> 00:45.879
- All right,
you want to go again?

00:45.879 --> 00:47.315
- Lily's 15.

00:47.315 --> 00:49.016
She walks home from school
by herself.

00:49.016 --> 00:51.018
- But she's never late,
so I called her principal,

00:51.018 --> 00:52.286
who said she was out today.

00:52.286 --> 00:53.487
- And her cell goes
right to voice mail.

00:53.487 --> 00:54.822
- Something's happened to her.
I know it.

00:54.822 --> 00:56.290
- Okay, Mr. and Mrs. Evans,

00:56.290 --> 00:58.025
let's just back it up,
all right?

00:58.025 --> 00:59.460
When was the last time
you saw Lily?

00:59.460 --> 01:01.262
- This morning.
She left at 6:15.

01:01.262 --> 01:02.563
- Why so early?

01:02.563 --> 01:04.598
- Swim team practice
at Asphalt Green.

01:04.598 --> 01:06.400
We called them.
She was there.

01:06.400 --> 01:07.868
Left around 7:30.

01:07.868 --> 01:09.137
- And what about friends,
boyfriends?

01:09.137 --> 01:10.438
Anyplace she might've gone?

01:10.438 --> 01:12.140
- No, we called everyone.

01:12.140 --> 01:15.143
Nobody's seen her.
She just...vanished.

01:15.143 --> 01:17.211
- And you know teenage boys.

01:17.211 --> 01:19.947
The attitude, the hormones,
the smell of the room.

01:19.947 --> 01:21.449
I mean, they don't
mind it so much.

01:21.449 --> 01:23.217
They'd rather die than be
seen with you,

01:23.217 --> 01:25.386
but still,
the whole thing...

01:25.386 --> 01:27.388
- Whoa. I should
actually get Noah home.

01:27.388 --> 01:28.822
- Oh, absolutely.

01:28.822 --> 01:31.058
Listen, let me get your number
for a playdate.

01:31.058 --> 01:33.227
It would be great
to get the kids together.

01:33.227 --> 01:36.164
- Noah.

01:36.164 --> 01:39.167
Noah?

01:40.968 --> 01:43.337
Noah?

01:43.337 --> 01:45.473
Noah?
Did you see where he went?

01:45.473 --> 01:46.940
- No.
Well, there's Hudson.

01:46.940 --> 01:48.008
- Noah?

01:48.008 --> 01:49.943
- Stay right there,
sweetie.

01:51.179 --> 01:52.846
- Noah?

01:52.846 --> 01:54.348
- So you say you
called her boyfriend?

01:54.348 --> 01:56.350
- Peter.
He's more like a friend.

01:56.350 --> 01:57.985
They've known each other
since pre-K.

01:57.985 --> 01:59.587
He hadn't seen
or heard from Lily all day.

01:59.587 --> 02:02.256
- Is this her iPad?
What's the password?

02:02.256 --> 02:03.857
- She doesn't have a password.

02:03.857 --> 02:06.727
- Yeah, she does.

02:08.596 --> 02:12.032
What's her cat's name?
Her--her birthday?

02:12.032 --> 02:14.067
- Noah?

02:14.067 --> 02:15.369
Noah!

02:15.369 --> 02:17.538
- You want me to call
the police?

02:17.538 --> 02:19.573
- Mama...

02:22.042 --> 02:23.544
- Oh, honey.

02:23.544 --> 02:24.878
Oh, honey.

02:24.878 --> 02:26.280
Hi, baby.

02:26.280 --> 02:29.250
Hi, sweetie.
Hi, baby.

02:29.250 --> 02:31.519
Oh, Noah,
you gave Mommy a scare.

02:31.519 --> 02:34.588
You gave Mommy
a scare.

02:34.588 --> 02:37.024
- SVU gets called
for missing teens now?

02:37.024 --> 02:39.927
- The lady's a clerk
at the DA's office.

02:39.927 --> 02:41.962
She didn't want lights
and sirens outside.

02:41.962 --> 02:43.897
- All right.
Well, it's not even 6:00.

02:43.897 --> 02:45.433
She's probably out getting high
with friends.

02:45.433 --> 02:47.235
All right, look,
we made a courtesy call,

02:47.235 --> 02:48.936
but unless there's contact
with an older male--

02:48.936 --> 02:50.304
- If it's a junk case,

02:50.304 --> 02:51.905
we'll kick it back
to the precinct.

02:51.905 --> 02:53.241
- Hey, Sarge.
Glad you're here.

02:53.241 --> 02:54.942
- What is it?
What did you find?

02:54.942 --> 02:57.144
- Hey, you said that
your daughter's friend's name

02:57.144 --> 02:58.779
was Peter?

02:58.779 --> 03:00.481
- Yes, but he doesn't know
where she is.

03:00.481 --> 03:02.950
- Lily ever talk about
a guy named Diego?

03:02.950 --> 03:05.286
- She doesn't know any Diego.

03:05.286 --> 03:07.020
- Yeah, she does.

03:07.020 --> 03:09.690
She was texting him some photos
this morning.

03:11.058 --> 03:12.993
This is Diego.

03:12.993 --> 03:14.995
Do you recognize him?

03:14.995 --> 03:18.065
- That is...
no one that Lily knows.

03:18.065 --> 03:19.833
I'm sure.

03:19.833 --> 03:22.270
- How about
we track him down and ask?

03:28.409 --> 03:31.412
[dramatic music]

04:14.355 --> 04:14.488
.

04:16.056 --> 04:16.690
- Hey.
- Lieutenant, that email

04:18.492 --> 04:19.927
was just an update.
You didn't have to come in.

04:19.927 --> 04:21.595
I'm here so you can
get some downtime.

04:21.595 --> 04:22.963
- Okay. Actually,
you should've called me earlier.

04:22.963 --> 04:24.598
How long has this child
been missing?

04:24.598 --> 04:26.367
- Maybe 12 hours.
But she's not a child.

04:26.367 --> 04:29.337
She's 15 years old
and probably a runaway.

04:29.337 --> 04:31.505
She's been sexting
a secret older boyfriend.

04:31.505 --> 04:33.841
- How much older?
- We don't know yet.

04:33.841 --> 04:35.843
Guy has a pay-as-you-go
Cricket cell.

04:35.843 --> 04:37.177
- Okay. And no trace
of her cell phone?

04:37.177 --> 04:39.179
- She must have shut it off.

04:39.179 --> 04:41.382
Fin's retracing her steps
since her morning swim.

04:41.382 --> 04:43.517
Carisi's talking to the parents,
but you know how that goes.

04:43.517 --> 04:45.386
Their daughter
"would never run away."

04:45.386 --> 04:47.120
- All right, okay, so you're
pulling in Lily's friends,

04:47.120 --> 04:49.623
going through cell phone
records, social media?

04:49.623 --> 04:51.359
- Check, check, and check.

04:51.359 --> 04:53.961
I had her description--
red gym bag, denim jacket--

04:53.961 --> 04:55.529
sent out to roll calls.

04:55.529 --> 04:56.997
Also flagged
her debit card.

04:56.997 --> 04:59.900
- Okay, so no history?
No trouble at school?

04:59.900 --> 05:01.569
- Well,
she has been acting out.

05:01.569 --> 05:03.637
We found cigarettes and condoms
in her bedroom,

05:03.637 --> 05:05.138
and you don't want to see--
- Sergeant.

05:05.138 --> 05:07.408
Lily's friend,
Peter Best, is here.

05:07.408 --> 05:09.142
- Thanks for coming in.

05:09.142 --> 05:11.779
Peter is close with Lily.
This is Lieutenant Benson.

05:11.779 --> 05:13.280
- Thank you for
all your help, Peter.

05:13.280 --> 05:15.883
So you're--
you're Lily's boyfriend?

05:15.883 --> 05:17.751
- More like
in the friend zone,

05:17.751 --> 05:20.287
but I really like her, and
I'm really worried about her.

05:20.287 --> 05:23.724
You said you might know
who she's with?

05:23.724 --> 05:26.394
- Did Lily ever
mention the name Diego?

05:26.394 --> 05:29.897
- No. But...she's been
weird lately.

05:29.897 --> 05:31.632
- Yeah? What do you mean?

05:31.632 --> 05:33.100
- She's been cutting class

05:33.100 --> 05:36.570
and leaving at lunch
and not coming back.

05:36.570 --> 05:38.439
- Okay.
Is there anything else?

05:38.439 --> 05:41.241
- She smelled like cigarettes
a few times,

05:41.241 --> 05:43.911
or maybe pot.

05:43.911 --> 05:46.614
- Acting out?
That's not like our daughter.

05:46.614 --> 05:49.149
Have you figured out who
that man from the picture is?

05:49.149 --> 05:50.851
- We've been trying
to track him down now.

05:50.851 --> 05:52.853
- Okay. Tell us
about her behavior, all right?

05:52.853 --> 05:55.989
Any changes?
Any new friends?

05:55.989 --> 05:58.025
- Teens get moody,
but not Lily.

05:58.025 --> 06:00.928
She's always smiling.
She's always singing.

06:00.928 --> 06:02.896
- She likes cats and swimming.

06:02.896 --> 06:05.599
- Why haven't you send out
an AMBER Alert?

06:05.599 --> 06:08.001
- Because we just
need to be certain

06:08.001 --> 06:09.903
that it is indeed an abduction.

06:09.903 --> 06:12.039
- Well, of course it is.

06:12.039 --> 06:14.041
- She said she couldn't talk
to her parents,

06:14.041 --> 06:15.709
that they don't
understand her.

06:15.709 --> 06:17.110
- Okay.
When she'd cut class,

06:17.110 --> 06:19.279
would she tell you
where she went?

06:19.279 --> 06:22.282
- No. But she's been hanging out
in this new squad.

06:22.282 --> 06:24.452
A whole new group of friends.

06:24.452 --> 06:26.219
- Yeah, I know how that goes.

06:26.219 --> 06:27.921
- She said that she wanted
to go from a pool girl

06:27.921 --> 06:29.457
to a cool girl this year.

06:29.457 --> 06:33.360
- Okay, and where do
the cool girls hang out?

06:33.360 --> 06:36.564
- They've been crashing frat
parties over at Tompkins Square.

06:39.266 --> 06:41.301
[knock at door]

06:43.604 --> 06:45.372
- Diego, my man.

06:45.372 --> 06:47.107
- Ready to party?

06:49.477 --> 06:51.645
Yo, what's up?
It's quiet in here.

06:51.645 --> 06:53.246
- NYPD.
Put your hands up.

06:53.246 --> 06:55.215
Put 'em up!

06:55.215 --> 06:57.485
- You knew about this?
You set me up?

06:57.485 --> 06:59.386
- Don't talk to him.
Talk to us.

06:59.386 --> 07:01.388
- No weapons.
Found some weed, though.

07:01.388 --> 07:03.023
- Where is she?

07:03.023 --> 07:05.358
- I don't know who that is.

07:05.358 --> 07:07.294
- How about now?

07:07.294 --> 07:09.162
- Yo, anything
she says about me is a lie.

07:09.162 --> 07:11.231
- Yeah. When was the last time
you talked to her?

07:11.231 --> 07:12.900
- When I found out
she was 15.

07:12.900 --> 07:14.568
15'll get you 20.
- You got that right.

07:14.568 --> 07:16.537
15 also makes those photos
on your cell phone

07:16.537 --> 07:19.640
child pornography.
Let's go.

07:19.640 --> 07:21.509
- How many times
do I have to tell you?

07:21.509 --> 07:23.877
I don't know
what happened to her.

07:23.877 --> 07:26.580
I was at work this morning.
I was there all day.

07:26.580 --> 07:28.015
- He keeps saying
he was at work.

07:28.015 --> 07:30.017
Anybody check his alibi
for this morning?

07:30.017 --> 07:31.719
- According
to the Ripped City website,

07:31.719 --> 07:34.021
he was teaching X-treme Combat
class all morning.

07:34.021 --> 07:35.889
- And he has no connection
to where Lily swims?

07:35.889 --> 07:37.591
- None.
That's Upper East.

07:37.591 --> 07:39.326
He's in Brooklyn.
Unis checked his apartment.

07:39.326 --> 07:40.928
No sign of the girl.

07:40.928 --> 07:43.030
- He swears he's been
in Brooklyn since last night.

07:43.030 --> 07:45.332
Only came into the city
when Kyle asked him for weed.

07:45.332 --> 07:47.267
Also, Lily's not the only girl
sexting him.

07:47.267 --> 07:48.736
I don't think
he's good for this.

07:48.736 --> 07:50.237
- Look,
we have enough to hold him.

07:50.237 --> 07:52.673
Fin, see if there's anyone
that he can think of

07:52.673 --> 07:54.942
that Lily
might be hanging with.

07:54.942 --> 07:56.910
16 hours.

07:56.910 --> 07:58.546
She could be anywhere.

07:58.546 --> 08:00.247
- Yeah, along with
all the other teenage girls

08:00.247 --> 08:01.649
who slipped out tonight.

08:01.649 --> 08:03.016
- Look, my dad has a saying.

08:03.016 --> 08:04.685
"Little kids you find,
elderly you find.

08:04.685 --> 08:06.353
Teenagers you solve."

08:06.353 --> 08:08.321
She's hooked up
with someone she knows.

08:08.321 --> 08:09.389
We've just got to find out
who that is.

08:09.389 --> 08:10.858
- No offense to your father,
Dodds...

08:10.858 --> 08:12.259
[phone vibrating]
But the longer this goes on,

08:12.259 --> 08:14.294
the less likely
that scenario is.

08:14.294 --> 08:15.996
- Hey, I got something.

08:15.996 --> 08:17.898
Homeless guy just tried to
use her debit card.

08:17.898 --> 08:20.300
Said he found it when he was
looking for cans and bottles.

08:20.300 --> 08:22.202
Unis are with him.

08:24.705 --> 08:26.039
- Like I told
those other officers,

08:26.039 --> 08:27.841
I didn't take that card.

08:27.841 --> 08:29.342
I found it.
- Okay, Stan.

08:29.342 --> 08:31.178
Why don't you tell us
where you found it?

08:31.178 --> 08:33.681
- Right there.
In that bag.

08:42.289 --> 08:44.224
- That's her bag.
- Okay.

08:44.224 --> 08:47.327
- They--they found it
under the West Side Highway?

08:47.327 --> 08:48.929
- Did this homeless man
hurt her?

08:48.929 --> 08:50.230
- Well, we--we don't know yet.

08:50.230 --> 08:51.599
We're just, uh,
we're bringing him in now.

08:51.599 --> 08:53.466
- Where is she?
We're--we're going up there.

08:53.466 --> 08:55.035
- Okay. It's probably best
if you stay here.

08:55.035 --> 08:56.503
We're grid searching
the area now.

08:56.503 --> 08:57.605
- No. No.
- Why don't you have a seat?

08:57.605 --> 08:59.239
- Come on.
Let them do their job.

08:59.239 --> 09:01.775
- Just have a seat
right here, Mrs. Evans.

09:01.775 --> 09:03.811
- All right, there you go.

09:12.019 --> 09:15.022
[indisting radio chatter
and sirens wailing]

09:15.022 --> 09:18.058
[dogs barking]

09:37.244 --> 09:39.212
- Hey! Hey.

09:50.958 --> 09:53.360
We're gonna open it,
okay, Sarge?

09:53.360 --> 09:55.696
- I'll call Liv
and the M.E.

09:55.696 --> 09:58.766
[tense music]

09:58.766 --> 10:06.807
*

10:10.911 --> 10:13.613
You okay?

10:21.722 --> 10:21.855
.

10:24.792 --> 10:25.125
- Are you sure?

10:27.494 --> 10:29.462
Couldn't this be a mistake?

10:29.462 --> 10:32.099
Someone else?

10:32.099 --> 10:34.201
- I...

10:34.201 --> 10:37.871
- We are so very sorry
for your loss.

10:39.740 --> 10:41.842
If you're ready, it would--

10:41.842 --> 10:43.510
it would really help us

10:43.510 --> 10:46.079
if you'd be able
to make a preliminary ID.

10:46.079 --> 10:48.281
Is that something you think
you might be able to do?

10:50.718 --> 10:52.753
- [sniffles, cries]

10:59.492 --> 11:01.461
- That's her.

11:01.461 --> 11:03.997
That's Lily.

11:03.997 --> 11:06.834
Who did this?
That homeless man?

11:06.834 --> 11:11.238
- We're talking to him,
but he's a bottles and cans guy.

11:11.238 --> 11:16.309
- He--he has no, um,
history of violence.

11:16.309 --> 11:18.011
- He had her ATM card.

11:18.011 --> 11:20.781
It must've been him.
- It doesn't matter.

11:20.781 --> 11:24.617
She's gone, Patrick.
Lily is gone.

11:26.787 --> 11:28.355
I have to see her.

11:30.590 --> 11:34.194
- As soon as the M.E. is--is--
is ready.

11:35.963 --> 11:39.767
- Cause of death was epidural
hematoma from blunt force trauma

11:39.767 --> 11:41.601
to the back of the skull.

11:41.601 --> 11:44.304
She died from a slow bleed
to the brain

11:44.304 --> 11:46.606
several hours
after the initial blow.

11:46.606 --> 11:48.008
- Sexual assault?

11:48.008 --> 11:49.943
- No evidence of penetration.

11:49.943 --> 11:51.611
No trauma
to the mouth or throat,

11:51.611 --> 11:53.380
but her clothing was torn,

11:53.380 --> 11:55.348
and I did find DNA
under her fingernails

11:55.348 --> 11:57.050
and semen on her thigh.

11:57.050 --> 11:58.651
- Enough for a match?

11:58.651 --> 12:01.088
- I asked the lab
to send over anything they find.

12:01.088 --> 12:02.189
- Dr. Warner?

12:02.189 --> 12:04.257
- Melinda, this is Dodds.

12:04.257 --> 12:06.693
- The new sergeant.
This your case?

12:06.693 --> 12:08.661
I'm still working the autopsy.

12:08.661 --> 12:10.463
- Is there anything
I can tell the parents?

12:10.463 --> 12:11.799
Uh...

12:15.602 --> 12:18.438
Um, what about
time of death?

12:18.438 --> 12:20.040
Can you tell me that?

12:20.040 --> 12:22.910
- Between 4:00 and 8:00 p.m.,
approximately.

12:22.910 --> 12:26.880
- So when we were with the
parents yesterday around 6:00,

12:26.880 --> 12:28.548
she was still alive?

12:28.548 --> 12:32.252
- At that moment?
I can't say with certainty.

12:35.155 --> 12:36.489
- All right,
why don't you tell me

12:36.489 --> 12:38.325
where you were
yesterday morning?

12:38.325 --> 12:39.827
- In St. Luke's ER.

12:39.827 --> 12:42.896
My diabetes was acting up,

12:42.896 --> 12:47.300
and by the time they let me out,
someone had stolen all my cans.

12:47.300 --> 12:50.904
So I was happy as hell
to find that card.

12:50.904 --> 12:53.941
- St. Luke's, huh?

12:55.275 --> 12:57.677
You better not
be lying to me.

13:05.085 --> 13:07.354
- What's going on?
- Well, hospital security

13:07.354 --> 13:09.189
just showed that Stan
was in the waiting room

13:09.189 --> 13:11.058
from 3:00 a.m. until noon,

13:11.058 --> 13:13.593
and the ER just confirmed that
he was discharged at 4:00 p.m.

13:13.593 --> 13:15.262
- Our guy's
still out there.

13:15.262 --> 13:17.264
- Then we go back to the pool.
Reinterview everyone.

13:17.264 --> 13:19.032
Someone saw her.

13:19.032 --> 13:20.767
- Melinda,
you got something?

13:20.767 --> 13:21.869
- I'm not sure.

13:21.869 --> 13:23.270
We usually don't do this
in New York,

13:23.270 --> 13:25.072
but I was so frustrated,
I asked the lab

13:25.072 --> 13:26.940
to do a less stringent
familial search.

13:26.940 --> 13:29.609
- We'll take whatever you got.
- No match.

13:29.609 --> 13:31.278
The perp's DNA wasn't in CODIS,

13:31.278 --> 13:34.247
but there was one partial match
in the database.

13:34.247 --> 13:36.549
A 15% overlap.
- 15%?

13:36.549 --> 13:38.919
That's closer than a stranger.
- A sibling?

13:38.919 --> 13:40.888
- That would be
more of an overlap.

13:40.888 --> 13:42.956
Both samples also
have an allelic dropout

13:42.956 --> 13:45.125
on the Y chromosome
at the same loci.

13:45.125 --> 13:47.360
- So the DNA in CODIS
shares that dropout

13:47.360 --> 13:48.896
with the DNA
from Lily's killer?

13:48.896 --> 13:51.899
- Right. Now, maybe
it's just a coincidence,

13:51.899 --> 13:54.034
but that and the overlap
together?

13:54.034 --> 13:57.404
If I had to guess,
the DNA profile in CODIS

13:57.404 --> 13:59.772
is a close male relative
to the killer,

13:59.772 --> 14:01.942
maybe a half-brother.

14:01.942 --> 14:04.677
- What's his name?

14:04.677 --> 14:06.513
- Brendan Cahill?

14:06.513 --> 14:09.316
NYPD.
We need to talk to you.

14:10.817 --> 14:14.587
- Uh...yeah, let's--
let's go in here.

14:15.822 --> 14:17.925
I had nothing
to do with this.

14:17.925 --> 14:20.027
- Yeah, maybe not,
but you know who did.

14:20.027 --> 14:22.195
We got a familial hit
on your DNA.

14:22.195 --> 14:23.496
- What does that mean?

14:23.496 --> 14:25.398
- Your DNA's in the system,
right?

14:25.398 --> 14:28.068
- I was trying to catch a train
and my card wouldn't swipe,

14:28.068 --> 14:30.170
so I jumped a turnstile.

14:30.170 --> 14:33.240
I knew I shouldn't have
pled guilty.

14:33.240 --> 14:34.975
That gives you the right
to threaten me?

14:34.975 --> 14:37.077
- You feel threatened?

14:37.077 --> 14:38.711
A little girl was murdered.

14:38.711 --> 14:41.348
- We need a list
of all your male relatives.

14:41.348 --> 14:44.651
- I can't help you.
- Yes, you can, and you will.

14:44.651 --> 14:46.519
You didn't do it,
but somebody in your family did.

14:46.519 --> 14:49.689
We know you have a half-brother
on your father's side.

14:49.689 --> 14:52.225
- Then you know more
about me than I do.

14:52.225 --> 14:54.361
I'm adopted.

14:54.361 --> 14:57.230
I have no idea
who my birth father is.

14:57.230 --> 14:59.166
- What about
your birth mother?

14:59.166 --> 15:01.001
- [sighs]
Um...

15:01.001 --> 15:03.403
I got a--I got a name
and an address

15:03.403 --> 15:05.805
from the registry
in Albany when I turned 18,

15:05.805 --> 15:09.276
but...I never contacted her.

15:09.276 --> 15:11.778
I-I'm sorry that
a girl is dead,

15:11.778 --> 15:13.981
and if I could help you,
I would.

15:13.981 --> 15:17.484
- Okay, just give us
your mother's name.

15:20.988 --> 15:24.457
- I gave him up for adoption
over 30 years ago.

15:24.457 --> 15:27.627
I told the registry
that he could contact me,

15:27.627 --> 15:29.596
but he never did.

15:29.596 --> 15:31.264
What--what is this about?

15:31.264 --> 15:34.034
- I know this must come
as quite a shock.

15:34.034 --> 15:36.369
- Did something happen
to him?

15:36.369 --> 15:39.772
- We're investigating a murder
of a young girl.

15:39.772 --> 15:41.474
- We have a DNA lead.

15:41.474 --> 15:45.345
We just need to know
who his birth father was.

15:45.345 --> 15:47.014
- I'd rather not.

15:47.014 --> 15:49.449
I was 16.

15:49.449 --> 15:51.384
The guy was married.

15:51.384 --> 15:53.820
- His wife
won't ever have to know.

15:53.820 --> 15:56.289
We just need to talk to him.

15:56.289 --> 15:57.857
- Well,
that's gonna be tough.

15:57.857 --> 16:00.060
He passed away
five years ago.

16:03.096 --> 16:05.898
Ray Marino was his name.

16:07.100 --> 16:09.802
- Did he have
any other children?

16:09.802 --> 16:11.538
- I believe he had two sons.

16:11.538 --> 16:13.806
They would be
in their 30s by now.

16:13.806 --> 16:17.144
George and Robby Marino.

16:17.144 --> 16:19.446
- Two kids?

16:19.446 --> 16:22.949
- Would you by any chance have
contact information for them?

16:24.717 --> 16:28.788
- Look, his widow still lives in
their house here on City Island.

16:28.788 --> 16:30.390
The boys are here too.

16:30.390 --> 16:34.461
They used to come
into the restaurant sometimes.

16:34.461 --> 16:37.264
I-I think I might still
have his home number,

16:37.264 --> 16:41.468
but please don't tell Camille
about me and Ray.

16:41.468 --> 16:43.136
- No need.

16:47.174 --> 16:50.277
- Hey, could I ask you
something?

16:50.277 --> 16:53.113
My son...

16:53.113 --> 16:55.715
What is his life like?

16:58.785 --> 17:01.554
- He's successful.

17:01.554 --> 17:05.325
He, uh, he seems
to have found his way.

17:16.503 --> 17:18.338
- We're almost done,
Mr. Marino.

17:18.338 --> 17:19.906
- I'm sorry,
I'm not sure that I follow.

17:19.906 --> 17:21.708
My name and my brother's name

17:21.708 --> 17:23.510
came up in
a criminal investigation?

17:23.510 --> 17:25.112
- Where were you yesterday,
Mr. Marino?

17:25.112 --> 17:26.846
- I was at my office
in Midtown.

17:26.846 --> 17:28.781
I'm a lawyer.
- We're talking early morning.

17:28.781 --> 17:30.217
7:00, 7:30.

17:30.217 --> 17:31.918
- I was in my car
driving in.

17:31.918 --> 17:33.920
- And your GPS and E-ZPass
will confirm that?

17:33.920 --> 17:35.922
- Yeah,
I'm sure they will.

17:35.922 --> 17:38.425
What is it that you guys
think I've done exactly?

17:39.859 --> 17:42.362
- Do you recognize this girl?

17:42.362 --> 17:44.131
- No, not at all.

17:44.131 --> 17:46.233
- She was murdered
yesterday.

17:48.135 --> 17:49.536
- Not by me.

17:49.536 --> 17:51.538
- What about your brother,
Robby?

17:51.538 --> 17:54.141
You know where he was
yesterday?

17:54.141 --> 17:56.909
- Look, I gave my DNA.

17:56.909 --> 17:59.279
You think I'd be talking
if I did anything to this girl?

17:59.279 --> 18:00.813
- Well, we appreciate
your cooperation.

18:00.813 --> 18:04.284
Now, tell me
where you were yesterday.

18:04.284 --> 18:06.286
- I'm trying to remember.

18:06.286 --> 18:07.954
- You need to tell me,
Robby.

18:07.954 --> 18:09.356
The truth.

18:09.356 --> 18:12.492
- I crashed
at my brother's office.

18:12.492 --> 18:15.228
He lets me sleep on a couch
there when I work nights.

18:15.228 --> 18:16.629
- You work as a roadie, right?

18:16.629 --> 18:18.198
- That's right.

18:18.198 --> 18:20.200
- Right.

18:20.200 --> 18:22.569
You use blankets
and ratchet straps like these

18:22.569 --> 18:24.504
when you're moving equipment?

18:24.504 --> 18:26.739
- Yeah, so?

18:26.739 --> 18:30.310
- So this girl's body was found
wrapped in a moving blanket.

18:30.310 --> 18:32.345
The same brand of moving blanket

18:32.345 --> 18:33.980
that we found
in the back of your van.

18:33.980 --> 18:35.682
- Everybody uses
that kind of blanket.

18:35.682 --> 18:37.884
- That may be, Robby,
but not everybody

18:37.884 --> 18:40.853
was arrested two years ago
for aggravated sexual assault.

18:40.853 --> 18:43.756
- I was acquitted
on all charges.

18:43.756 --> 18:46.193
- Your brother defend you
on that?

18:46.193 --> 18:47.660
- The complainant
was some groupie.

18:47.660 --> 18:49.061
She didn't even testify.

18:49.061 --> 18:50.863
- After you paid her off?

18:50.863 --> 18:52.532
- The jury believed Robby.

18:52.532 --> 18:55.902
- Did you believe him?

18:55.902 --> 18:57.937
Probably not, right?

19:00.407 --> 19:02.609
I get it.
He's your little brother.

19:02.609 --> 19:04.644
You cover for him.

19:08.581 --> 19:10.850
- Robby's...

19:10.850 --> 19:13.820
struggled.

19:13.820 --> 19:15.322
If there's a smart way
or a stupid way,

19:15.322 --> 19:17.490
Robby does things
the stupid way.

19:17.490 --> 19:20.793
- Which means you've had to make
excuses for him your whole life.

19:23.296 --> 19:25.131
How old were you...

19:25.131 --> 19:26.933
nine or ten when your old man
pulls you aside and tells you,

19:26.933 --> 19:30.903
"Whatever you do, you look out
for your little brother"?

19:33.105 --> 19:36.976
You're a decent man,
and you have a conscience.

19:36.976 --> 19:39.078
Robby's saying he was with you
all day yesterday,

19:39.078 --> 19:41.381
but that's not true, is it?

19:45.252 --> 19:47.254
- [exhales slowly]

19:49.322 --> 19:50.457
No.

19:50.457 --> 19:53.660
[sighs]

19:53.660 --> 19:55.828
He's been brought in
by the police before.

19:55.828 --> 19:57.364
Gets high.

19:57.364 --> 20:01.401
He, uh...forgets
where he's been.

20:01.401 --> 20:05.538
So I told him if he's ever taken
in to say that he was with me.

20:07.206 --> 20:10.243
- Let me ask you
something.

20:12.379 --> 20:15.515
Is Robby capable of doing
something like this?

20:15.515 --> 20:17.049
Killing this girl?

20:18.985 --> 20:21.688
- I hope to God he isn't.

20:40.340 --> 20:40.473
.

20:42.108 --> 20:42.942
- I was with my brother.
I was with George.

20:44.411 --> 20:46.679
- No, you weren't.
We've been over this, Robby.

20:46.679 --> 20:48.247
- Your brother gave you up.

20:48.247 --> 20:50.082
He told us he has no idea
where you were that day.

20:50.082 --> 20:51.217
- [groans]
Uhh!

20:52.652 --> 20:55.655
- Let's start from
the beginning, okay?

20:55.655 --> 20:58.591
When you first saw Lily alive
in her denim jacket

20:58.591 --> 21:00.293
with the red gym bag--
- I can't.

21:00.293 --> 21:01.861
I can't look at that anymore.
Please.

21:01.861 --> 21:03.363
- You can, Robby.
- I can't look.

21:03.363 --> 21:04.931
Please don't make me.

21:04.931 --> 21:06.098
- No, you don't get
to close your eyes.

21:06.098 --> 21:07.334
Not yet.
- Liv.

21:07.334 --> 21:08.901
- Hold on.
[click]

21:08.901 --> 21:10.537
They may be getting somewhere.

21:10.537 --> 21:12.372
- They should be.
It's been six hours.

21:12.372 --> 21:13.840
- Do you have anything
that can help them out?

21:13.840 --> 21:15.542
Video, forensics?

21:15.542 --> 21:18.345
- CSU is still checking on
his van and the moving blankets.

21:18.345 --> 21:21.548
- Okay. So no blood,
no hair--nothing.

21:26.719 --> 21:28.588
Call Melinda.

21:28.588 --> 21:31.358
Put some pressure on her.

21:31.358 --> 21:32.625
- You know what I think?

21:33.860 --> 21:36.896
I think she saw you first.

21:36.896 --> 21:39.699
She started
flirting with you, right?

21:39.699 --> 21:42.369
She gave you
that little smile.

21:42.369 --> 21:44.236
- I don't know.

21:44.236 --> 21:46.406
- She's flipping
her hair around.

21:46.406 --> 21:48.908
I mean, she looked right at you,
didn't she?

21:48.908 --> 21:52.945
And she came over to the van.
Wanted a ride.

21:52.945 --> 21:54.647
Is that what happened?

21:54.647 --> 21:56.148
- Maybe.

21:56.148 --> 21:59.752
- Then once she's in the van,
you figure,

21:59.752 --> 22:01.988
"Hey, she wants it."

22:01.988 --> 22:04.857
I mean, she wants you.

22:04.857 --> 22:07.627
She takes off her jacket,
her little T-shirt--

22:07.627 --> 22:10.062
- I just want to sleep.
- Well, you can sleep

22:10.062 --> 22:13.065
once you've told us the truth
about what you did to Lily.

22:13.065 --> 22:15.768
- Once you tell us
she got into your van.

22:19.739 --> 22:22.709
- Yeah, okay.

22:22.709 --> 22:24.677
She got in the van.

22:26.913 --> 22:28.214
- All right.
She was nice to you at first.

22:28.214 --> 22:29.582
Maybe gave you a kiss.

22:29.582 --> 22:32.218
- But then--
then she changes her mind.

22:32.218 --> 22:33.553
She starts crying, right?

22:33.553 --> 22:36.055
Don't you hate
when they do that?

22:36.055 --> 22:38.725
She put it out there,
then she takes it away?

22:38.725 --> 22:40.493
No. That's not right, Robby.

22:40.493 --> 22:41.594
That's not right.
- No.

22:41.594 --> 22:43.262
- She was taunting you.
- Bad.

22:43.262 --> 22:44.497
- That made you mad.

22:44.497 --> 22:46.599
- Yeah.
I don't like that.

22:46.599 --> 22:48.901
- Yeah. No one does, Robby.

22:48.901 --> 22:51.571
Look, we all know
what happened here,

22:51.571 --> 22:53.440
but we need to hear it from you.

22:53.440 --> 22:56.042
[knocking on glass]

22:56.042 --> 22:58.344
You tell us this,
it's all over.

22:58.344 --> 22:59.746
You'll feel better,
believe me.

22:59.746 --> 23:01.448
[knocking continues]

23:03.282 --> 23:05.084
I'm gonna get a pen and paper.

23:05.084 --> 23:07.887
We're gonna put this to rest.

23:13.693 --> 23:15.294
He is right on the edge.

23:15.294 --> 23:16.696
- Pull him out.
We're done with him.

23:16.696 --> 23:17.997
- Did you hear
what he was saying?

23:17.997 --> 23:19.298
- He's not our guy,
Sergeant.

23:19.298 --> 23:20.800
- The DNA on Lily's body

23:20.800 --> 23:23.135
doesn't match
either of these brothers.

23:23.135 --> 23:25.304
- Are you sure?
- Positive.

23:25.304 --> 23:28.174
- Okay.
Then--then who?

23:28.174 --> 23:29.676
Are we back to
the half-brother Brendan?

23:29.676 --> 23:31.343
- No, none of them.

23:31.343 --> 23:33.379
I do think these three
are related to the killer,

23:33.379 --> 23:35.281
possibly
another half-brother.

23:35.281 --> 23:37.650
- And Ray Marino
fathered them all?

23:37.650 --> 23:40.653
- I can't be sure.
I need Ray Marino's DNA.

23:40.653 --> 23:42.989
- Melinda,
he's been dead five years.

23:42.989 --> 23:46.225
- Well, maybe his widow kept
a hairbrush, a razor--something.

23:46.225 --> 23:47.860
- No, she doesn't even want
to talk to us.

23:47.860 --> 23:50.296
- Well,
there is another option.

23:50.296 --> 23:52.499
Was he buried or cremated?

24:08.581 --> 24:09.949
- Pics for your
Facebook page?

24:09.949 --> 24:12.051
- These're for Rollins.

24:12.051 --> 24:13.786
She's gonna be pissed
she missed this.

24:13.786 --> 24:15.522
- How's she doing?

24:15.522 --> 24:17.123
- Bed rest.

24:17.123 --> 24:19.091
Bored out of her mind.

24:23.162 --> 24:25.397
- So Ray Marino.
Do we got a match?

24:25.397 --> 24:29.669
- Yes. Ray Marino fathered
Brendan Cahill, who was adopted,

24:29.669 --> 24:31.070
the two City Island brothers,

24:31.070 --> 24:33.540
George and Robby Marino,
who are cleared.

24:33.540 --> 24:36.275
So somewhere at some point,

24:36.275 --> 24:39.812
he had at least one other son
with a third woman.

24:39.812 --> 24:41.914
- Okay. So Ray was a player.

24:41.914 --> 24:45.251
Anything else that we can go on?
Height, eye color?

24:45.251 --> 24:46.418
- Nothing definitive.

24:46.418 --> 24:48.588
Male Caucasian.
European descent.

24:48.588 --> 24:50.289
Mother isn't Asian or black.

24:50.289 --> 24:51.958
- What about the timeline?

24:51.958 --> 24:54.026
Like, can't you tell age
with that epigenetic stuff?

24:54.026 --> 24:58.197
- The science isn't really there
on specifying age from DNA,

24:58.197 --> 25:01.568
but I did take another look
at the semen on the body.

25:01.568 --> 25:03.435
- You can tell age
from semen?

25:03.435 --> 25:06.773
- Not precisely,
but if I had to guess,

25:06.773 --> 25:10.610
I think your killer
is the last born of the four.

25:10.610 --> 25:13.613
He's closer to 20 than 40.
- Okay.

25:13.613 --> 25:15.114
- Given the age spread,

25:15.114 --> 25:16.916
it's likely a second
or third marriage.

25:16.916 --> 25:19.285
- It's not.
Ray Marino was married

25:19.285 --> 25:21.120
to the same woman
till the day he died.

25:21.120 --> 25:22.622
- Yeah, but he was a dog.

25:22.622 --> 25:24.023
I mean, he fathered Brendan
out of wedlock.

25:24.023 --> 25:25.457
Now we know he fathered
somebody else.

25:25.457 --> 25:28.260
- So we're looking
for the illegitimate son

25:28.260 --> 25:30.663
of a dead man.

25:33.432 --> 25:35.101
- Mrs. Marino,
we are so sorry

25:35.101 --> 25:37.269
for what we did to you
and your boys.

25:37.269 --> 25:39.606
The good news is is that
they had nothing to do with--

25:39.606 --> 25:41.073
- Yeah, well, of course
they didn't.

25:41.073 --> 25:42.909
I told him that
when he came to the door.

25:42.909 --> 25:45.111
- Yes, you did, but even so,
there is a bad guy out there,

25:45.111 --> 25:47.146
and he assaulted
and killed a young girl.

25:47.146 --> 25:48.948
- Oh. Well, we have nothing
to do with that.

25:48.948 --> 25:50.783
- Right,
but it may have something

25:50.783 --> 25:51.984
to do with your husband.

25:51.984 --> 25:53.452
- How?

25:53.452 --> 25:55.655
Ray passed away
five years ago this month.

25:55.655 --> 25:58.991
- And we believe that he may
have taken a secret with him.

25:58.991 --> 26:02.461
We weren't sure before
we checked the DNA, but...

26:02.461 --> 26:07.166
but your husband
had another son, and--

26:07.166 --> 26:08.701
were you aware of that?

26:08.701 --> 26:10.336
- No, that's--
that's not possible.

26:10.336 --> 26:12.639
We--we started going out
in the eighth grade.

26:12.639 --> 26:14.140
40 years we were in love.

26:14.140 --> 26:15.908
- 40 years.
That is a long time.

26:15.908 --> 26:17.543
Were the two of you
ever separated?

26:17.543 --> 26:19.178
Did his work ever take him away?
- His work?

26:19.178 --> 26:21.814
He was a driver for
the New York Bus Service.

26:21.814 --> 26:23.415
He never missed a shift.

26:23.415 --> 26:25.417
He came home every night
for dinner.

26:25.417 --> 26:28.320
And I told George
that we are gonna sue the NYPD

26:28.320 --> 26:29.488
for what you did.

26:29.488 --> 26:31.490
This is my family.
My home.

26:31.490 --> 26:34.060
Don't you ever
talk to any of us again.

26:34.060 --> 26:35.394
Tell them we'll sue.
- Yeah.

26:35.394 --> 26:36.929
I will, Mom.
Listen, I don't want you

26:36.929 --> 26:38.665
getting stressed
with your blood pressure.

26:38.665 --> 26:41.067
Just try to calm down,
and take a nitro.

26:42.735 --> 26:45.337
- Mr. Marino, we don't mean
to upset your mother,

26:45.337 --> 26:48.507
but you're a smart man.

26:48.507 --> 26:49.842
DNA doesn't lie.

26:49.842 --> 26:52.444
- [sighs]

26:52.444 --> 26:54.847
So I really have
a half-brother

26:54.847 --> 26:56.282
I never knew about, huh?

26:56.282 --> 26:58.284
- And he is good for this crime.

27:00.119 --> 27:02.689
- Let me walk you to your car.

27:02.689 --> 27:05.491
My mother's always thought
my father was a saint,

27:05.491 --> 27:06.993
and he loved her,

27:06.993 --> 27:09.696
but he had an eye.

27:09.696 --> 27:12.164
- Okay.
So what can you tell us?

27:12.164 --> 27:13.933
- Well, Ray
was a good-looking guy.

27:13.933 --> 27:15.768
He had a full head
of dark hair,

27:15.768 --> 27:17.203
and he was a charmer,
you know?

27:17.203 --> 27:19.105
He drove the express bus
into Manhattan.

27:19.105 --> 27:20.840
There was always
some pretty woman or another

27:20.840 --> 27:24.010
sitting right behind him,
talking to him the whole ride.

27:24.010 --> 27:26.378
- Anybody in particular
that you can remember?

27:26.378 --> 27:27.513
- How long ago?

27:27.513 --> 27:30.182
- 20, 25 years.

27:32.719 --> 27:34.721
- Yeah, I was around 12.

27:34.721 --> 27:37.523
I was going into seventh grade.
New school.

27:37.523 --> 27:39.726
[laughs]
Anyway, my father

27:39.726 --> 27:42.361
took Robby and me
to this big Labor Day carnival,

27:42.361 --> 27:44.030
and Mom stayed home,

27:44.030 --> 27:46.565
and we met up
with this friend of his.

27:46.565 --> 27:49.068
I remember she had
a lot of lipstick on.

27:49.068 --> 27:52.739
Her five-year-old twins
were with her--a boy and a girl.

27:52.739 --> 27:54.373
- You remember that?

27:54.373 --> 27:57.476
- [laughs] Yeah, I do,
'cause I was jealous.

27:57.476 --> 28:00.412
I mean, my father must've spent,
like, $50 at this one booth

28:00.412 --> 28:02.882
trying to get the three balls
into the basket.

28:02.882 --> 28:05.451
He finally won,
and as a prize he picks out

28:05.451 --> 28:08.487
this foam football
that he knew I really wanted.

28:08.487 --> 28:11.657
He gave it to
the boy twin instead.

28:11.657 --> 28:14.761
He doted on those children.

28:14.761 --> 28:16.628
In hindsight...

28:16.628 --> 28:19.766
- You think he wanted you
to meet your half-siblings?

28:19.766 --> 28:21.333
- Maybe.

28:22.902 --> 28:25.571
On the drive home,
he bought us both ice creams,

28:25.571 --> 28:28.274
and he kept making us promise
not to tell our mother

28:28.274 --> 28:31.177
that we ran into...Stella.

28:31.177 --> 28:33.913
That was her name.
Stella.

28:33.913 --> 28:35.782
- Does she have
a last name?

28:35.782 --> 28:39.251
- I don't remember that, but she
used to work in the museum.

28:50.830 --> 28:50.963
.

28:52.631 --> 28:53.265
- Yes, my daughter Nina
is 30.

28:54.967 --> 28:56.368
Why?
- She has a twin brother.

28:56.368 --> 28:59.105
- No, not anymore.

28:59.105 --> 29:03.542
We lost Nicholas in a motorcycle
accident ten years ago.

29:03.542 --> 29:05.945
- Oh, I'm sorry.

29:05.945 --> 29:07.914
- You obviously didn't know.

29:07.914 --> 29:11.851
Same way I don't know why two
police officers from Manhattan

29:11.851 --> 29:15.254
are asking about my Nicholas.

29:15.254 --> 29:17.056
He was the only one
in that accident.

29:17.056 --> 29:19.391
Is somebody blaming him
for something now?

29:19.391 --> 29:22.829
- His father came up
in an investigation.

29:22.829 --> 29:25.197
- His father?

29:25.197 --> 29:28.134
Is...also dead.

29:28.134 --> 29:29.735
Five years ago.

29:29.735 --> 29:33.639
- So Ray Marino was the
biological father of the twins?

29:33.639 --> 29:35.541
- How do you...

29:35.541 --> 29:37.709
No one knows that.

29:37.709 --> 29:39.846
- So I'll take that as a yes.

29:39.846 --> 29:41.613
- Look, it's a long story,

29:41.613 --> 29:44.283
and telling it now would only
hurt a lot of innocent people.

29:44.283 --> 29:46.152
- I don't mean to pry, but...

29:46.152 --> 29:49.288
Did you and Ray
have any other children?

29:49.288 --> 29:51.958
- No. I-I thought
we might someday,

29:51.958 --> 29:53.993
but, uh, turns out
the whole time

29:53.993 --> 29:57.296
he and I were running around
behind Camille's back,

29:57.296 --> 29:59.331
he was cheating on me too.

30:00.732 --> 30:02.734
- Did you know the other woman?

30:02.734 --> 30:04.904
- That's the part
that stung the most.

30:04.904 --> 30:07.439
She was my best friend
from high school, Helen.

30:07.439 --> 30:09.942
- Do you still keep
in touch?

30:09.942 --> 30:12.478
- I didn't want
to publicly unfriend her.

30:12.478 --> 30:15.281
She's always posting pictures of
her family on my Facebook feed.

30:15.281 --> 30:16.682
- So she has kids?

30:16.682 --> 30:18.951
- Oh, yeah, the Ryan boys.
Three of them.

30:18.951 --> 30:21.353
The whole time
she and Ray were running around,

30:21.353 --> 30:23.990
she was married too.

30:23.990 --> 30:26.025
Maybe that's why they lasted.

30:29.495 --> 30:31.830
- Yes, that's my family.
Why do you have this?

30:31.830 --> 30:33.866
- One of your sons
may have information

30:33.866 --> 30:35.501
relevant
to an investigation.

30:35.501 --> 30:37.269
- When's the last time
you saw them?

30:37.269 --> 30:39.171
- I see them every weekend.

30:39.171 --> 30:41.540
They still come home for Sunday
dinner with their mother.

30:41.540 --> 30:43.109
What investigation?

30:43.109 --> 30:46.278
- It's a cold case.
We just got a new lead.

30:46.278 --> 30:48.847
You know this guy?

30:48.847 --> 30:51.317
- Yes, that's Ray Marino.

30:51.317 --> 30:52.684
He died about five years ago.

30:52.684 --> 30:54.620
My husband and I
went to the funeral.

30:54.620 --> 30:56.555
- So you were close.

30:56.555 --> 30:58.024
- We were acquainted.

30:59.158 --> 31:00.426
- Mrs. Ryan?

31:02.461 --> 31:04.463
I don't mean
any disrespect here,

31:04.463 --> 31:07.399
but we've been told that
you and Ray were...

31:07.399 --> 31:09.768
more than that.

31:09.768 --> 31:12.571
- What is going on with Ray
all of a sudden?

31:12.571 --> 31:14.573
I heard they exhumed his body.

31:14.573 --> 31:16.375
Look, everybody knows
everybody's business

31:16.375 --> 31:18.377
on City Island.

31:18.377 --> 31:20.212
- Well, they're not gonna
get anything from us.

31:20.212 --> 31:21.547
So whatever you can tell me

31:21.547 --> 31:22.949
about your relationship
with Ray,

31:22.949 --> 31:24.483
we're gonna
keep that confidential.

31:24.483 --> 31:27.219
- There was no relationship.
I barely knew him.

31:27.219 --> 31:29.288
I do know, however,
that my husband

31:29.288 --> 31:30.789
wouldn't want me
or any of our sons

31:30.789 --> 31:33.659
talking to the police
without him.

31:33.659 --> 31:35.794
Now, if you'll excuse me.

31:39.665 --> 31:41.267
- So what are we up to now?

31:41.267 --> 31:43.802
Four women that Ray Marino
fathered a child with?

31:43.802 --> 31:46.105
- No wonder the guy
died from a heart attack.

31:46.105 --> 31:47.974
And that mother, Helen Ryan?

31:47.974 --> 31:49.976
She flat-out denied
having an affair.

31:49.976 --> 31:52.078
- Which is exactly what people
who're having affairs do.

31:52.078 --> 31:54.480
- Well, she's still married?
The last thing she wants

31:54.480 --> 31:58.184
is her husband finding out
that one of his boys is not his.

31:58.184 --> 32:00.086
- Yeah, or more than one.
They all look alike.

32:00.086 --> 32:02.421
- All right. So what do we know
about the brothers?

32:02.421 --> 32:03.822
- No records.

32:03.822 --> 32:05.257
No DNA in the system.

32:05.257 --> 32:07.326
- Can we put any of them
in the vicinity

32:07.326 --> 32:08.394
where Lily went missing?
- Yeah.

32:08.394 --> 32:10.229
Two of them work in Manhattan.

32:10.229 --> 32:13.199
The oldest, Dan Jr., works
security at the Metropolitan.

32:13.199 --> 32:15.367
The middle kid, Gary,
is a beverage distributor.

32:15.367 --> 32:17.336
- And the youngest, Mark,
is a psych major.

32:17.336 --> 32:19.005
He lives in East Harlem.

32:19.005 --> 32:20.672
- Ray could've fathered
one of these boys.

32:20.672 --> 32:22.174
I mean,
the guy was active.

32:22.174 --> 32:23.709
- We keep hearing no one

32:23.709 --> 32:25.244
leaves City Island,
that it's a closed loop.

32:25.244 --> 32:26.912
How about we get a warrant
for the DNA

32:26.912 --> 32:28.347
of every male
between 20 and 30?

32:28.347 --> 32:30.216
- What--hello?
Civil liberties?

32:30.216 --> 32:31.783
There's not a judge in the
county that'll sign off on that.

32:31.783 --> 32:34.020
- So we keep investigating,
right?

32:34.020 --> 32:36.722
Canvass Asphalt Green,
Lily's school.

32:36.722 --> 32:39.058
See if anybody can make an ID
on the Ryan brothers,

32:39.058 --> 32:40.792
and double-check security cams.

32:40.792 --> 32:42.861
- Let's just pick them up.
Find an excuse later.

32:42.861 --> 32:45.131
- Dodds, not till we know
what we're doing.

32:45.131 --> 32:47.899
- Hold up.
We don't have to go to them.

32:47.899 --> 32:50.769
They go to their mother's house
every Sunday.

32:58.077 --> 32:59.711
- What, you're making me
do this again?

32:59.711 --> 33:01.413
Look, I was at dinner
at my ma's, all right?

33:01.413 --> 33:03.649
I had one beer
and one friggin' O'Doul's.

33:03.649 --> 33:05.284
- All right, look, Mr. Ryan.

33:05.284 --> 33:06.785
I don't like working checkpoints
either, all right?

33:06.785 --> 33:08.387
But you heard
about that accident last week?

33:08.387 --> 33:10.689
That guy had a few--now
the local moms are up in arms,

33:10.689 --> 33:12.891
so bear with me.
Blow.

33:17.529 --> 33:20.099
Keep going.
All right.

33:23.069 --> 33:25.737
Hey, you're right.
Sober as a judge.

33:25.737 --> 33:26.872
- Told you.
- All right.

33:26.872 --> 33:28.440
You have a nice night now.

33:30.976 --> 33:33.579
All right, we're good
on all three brothers.

33:33.579 --> 33:35.547
How come you had me run
Gary twice?

33:35.547 --> 33:37.849
- Just to be sure.

33:37.849 --> 33:40.552
I saw ratchet ties
in the back of his van.

33:40.552 --> 33:42.521
- Can we go now, please?

33:42.521 --> 33:44.423
I'm having
Staten Island flashbacks.

33:44.423 --> 33:48.227
- No, let's do a few more
in case anybody's watching.

33:48.227 --> 33:52.098
- Whose idea was it to get DNA
off of the Breathalyzers?

33:52.098 --> 33:53.832
- Mine.
I figured that way--

33:53.832 --> 33:55.501
- You know, Fin, let's take
the victory lap later.

33:55.501 --> 33:57.403
Melinda, what do we have?

33:57.403 --> 33:59.271
- The semen on Lily's thigh

33:59.271 --> 34:01.540
and the DNA
under her fingernails

34:01.540 --> 34:03.842
is a straight match...

34:03.842 --> 34:06.445
for Gary Ryan.

34:06.445 --> 34:08.514
- Proof.

34:08.514 --> 34:10.549
Finally.

34:14.253 --> 34:16.122
- Gary?
He's on his route now.

34:16.122 --> 34:18.490
- He ever deliver
around Asphalt Green?

34:18.490 --> 34:20.859
- Yeah, he refills
the vending machines up there.

34:20.859 --> 34:22.461
- Okay, good.
We need to talk to him.

34:22.461 --> 34:23.995
He may have witnessed
an accident.

34:23.995 --> 34:25.631
- Oh. Well,
let me give him a call.

34:25.631 --> 34:27.433
- Actually, don't.
We'll talk to him.

34:27.433 --> 34:29.635
Where's his next stop?

34:36.708 --> 34:39.511
- Gary Ryan.

34:39.511 --> 34:41.313
- Police. Stop!

34:43.149 --> 34:45.984
- Look out!
- [yelps]

34:45.984 --> 34:47.853
[brakes screech,
horn honks]

34:47.853 --> 34:50.156
[horn honking]

34:54.393 --> 34:56.428
- I got you,
you son of a bitch.

34:58.164 --> 34:59.431
Don't move.

34:59.431 --> 35:01.400
Don't move.

35:01.400 --> 35:02.734
- You're hurting me.
Stop!

35:02.734 --> 35:04.770
- Hey!
Don't give me an excuse.

35:04.770 --> 35:06.472
- Ah!

35:06.472 --> 35:08.440
- Sergeant.

35:19.218 --> 35:19.351
.

35:21.920 --> 35:22.588
- He lawyer up yet?
- Not yet.

35:24.290 --> 35:26.225
But we don't need
his statement.

35:26.225 --> 35:27.959
- Yeah, we know it's him.
We got the DNA, Lily's blood,

35:27.959 --> 35:29.661
fibers from the moving blankets,
ratchet straps in the van--

35:29.661 --> 35:31.763
- Yeah,
but we don't know why.

35:31.763 --> 35:34.566
- There's never a good answer
to that question.

35:34.566 --> 35:36.335
- Okay, guys.

35:36.335 --> 35:38.204
Really nice work.

35:38.204 --> 35:40.206
I'll call Barba.

35:43.309 --> 35:45.511
- You know,
a confession can't hurt.

35:45.511 --> 35:48.046
- It can if it's coerced.

35:49.448 --> 35:51.783
- I'll do this by the book.

35:51.783 --> 35:54.220
Look, Lily went missing,

35:54.220 --> 35:55.587
I jumped
to the wrong conclusion,

35:55.587 --> 35:56.955
and we lost a lot of time.

35:56.955 --> 35:58.590
- Dodds, you can't
put this on yourself.

35:58.590 --> 36:00.292
- We might have
found her alive.

36:00.292 --> 36:03.629
- Lily was gone the second
he pulled her into that van.

36:07.333 --> 36:09.268
- Let me hear that
from him.

36:11.370 --> 36:13.104
- Okay.

36:16.107 --> 36:18.477
I'm Lieutenant Benson,
Gary.

36:20.579 --> 36:24.450
I understand that
you ran, so...

36:24.450 --> 36:26.585
that means you must know
why you're here.

36:26.585 --> 36:28.687
Right?

36:28.687 --> 36:33.892
- We found your DNA on the girl
and hers in your van.

36:33.892 --> 36:36.161
How'd that happen?

36:38.930 --> 36:42.901
- She--she--she got
into the van.

36:42.901 --> 36:47.739
Sat right up front next to me.

36:47.739 --> 36:49.808
I gave her a soda.

36:49.808 --> 36:52.544
- So you two knew
each other?

36:52.544 --> 36:55.781
- I'd seen her...
outside the pool.

36:55.781 --> 36:58.284
- And something went wrong?

36:58.284 --> 37:00.886
I don't think
you wanted to hurt her.

37:00.886 --> 37:04.856
- No. Like,
I just wanted to talk to her.

37:04.856 --> 37:06.825
I load soda machines
at the complex.

37:06.825 --> 37:08.960
I see her every day.
She's cute.

37:08.960 --> 37:10.962
She'd even smile at me.

37:10.962 --> 37:12.664
- You were hoping you two
could be friends.

37:12.664 --> 37:14.500
- Yeah.

37:14.500 --> 37:17.369
I'd smile, ask her if she
could give me a smile back.

37:17.369 --> 37:18.537
- Okay. And last week?

37:18.537 --> 37:20.171
- I asked her
if she wanted a soda,

37:20.171 --> 37:23.542
a Vitamin Water,
something.

37:23.542 --> 37:25.010
- And she did?

37:25.010 --> 37:27.879
- Look, I didn't grab her
or scare her

37:27.879 --> 37:31.016
or anything.

37:31.016 --> 37:33.685
She got in all on her own.

37:33.685 --> 37:36.322
- So what happened?

37:36.322 --> 37:40.426
- I asked her
if I could drop her someplace.

37:44.696 --> 37:46.632
Then I tried to kiss her.

37:51.370 --> 37:53.872
I tried to kiss her,
and she said no.

37:53.872 --> 37:57.208
[sniffles]
She started yelling.

37:59.345 --> 38:03.248
I thought someone would hear,
so I-I covered her mouth,

38:03.248 --> 38:05.351
and I pulled her in the back.

38:05.351 --> 38:08.186
- And what did you do
in the back, Gary?

38:10.856 --> 38:14.693
- I shook her...
[sniffles]

38:14.693 --> 38:16.528
To get her quiet,

38:16.528 --> 38:20.499
then her head banged
against the floor.

38:20.499 --> 38:22.834
She went out cold.

38:27.773 --> 38:31.710
Then I was scared,
so I started driving fast.

38:31.710 --> 38:33.712
After a while,
I parked the van.

38:33.712 --> 38:35.547
I-I got out.

38:35.547 --> 38:37.983
I was gonna let her go...

38:41.219 --> 38:42.888
But it was too late.

38:42.888 --> 38:44.490
- She could've still been alive.

38:44.490 --> 38:46.492
- [crying]
I don't think so.

38:46.492 --> 38:49.495
She wasn't breathing.

38:52.130 --> 38:56.001
I couldn't feel no pulse.

38:56.001 --> 38:58.036
- What did you do then?

38:58.036 --> 39:01.640
- I waited a long time
till it got dark,

39:01.640 --> 39:03.775
and then I--
[crying]

39:07.413 --> 39:09.415
Wrapped her in a blanket,

39:09.415 --> 39:12.784
and I left her there
under a ramp.

39:12.784 --> 39:14.620
- Why didn't you call
anyone?

39:14.620 --> 39:16.488
- It was only an accident.

39:19.324 --> 39:22.461
I knew no one would believe me.
I...

39:22.461 --> 39:25.497
I've been sick about it
ever since.

39:40.612 --> 39:43.682
- Why Lily?

39:45.617 --> 39:47.886
- He'd seen her before.

39:49.488 --> 39:50.956
- My God.

39:50.956 --> 39:55.026
He just...grabbed her,

39:55.026 --> 39:59.197
attacked her,
killed her?

39:59.197 --> 40:00.899
For no reason?

40:02.868 --> 40:07.238
- I wish...
that we had a better answer.

40:10.509 --> 40:13.979
- I am so very sorry.

40:20.285 --> 40:21.319
[phone ringing]

40:22.988 --> 40:25.090
- Glad that one's over.
That was a brutal case.

40:27.025 --> 40:29.695
- You okay, Sarge?

40:29.695 --> 40:31.830
- Yeah, I am.

40:31.830 --> 40:34.365
But the Evans
and those other families?

40:34.365 --> 40:36.334
How do they come back
from something like this?

40:36.334 --> 40:37.736
- We got the guy,
Dodds.

40:37.736 --> 40:40.572
That's as good
as it ever gets.

40:40.572 --> 40:43.008
- You going to see Amanda?

40:43.008 --> 40:44.876
- Yeah,
I thought I'd stop by.

40:44.876 --> 40:47.212
- You know what?
She's been living on takeout.

40:47.212 --> 40:49.014
How about we all go up there?

40:49.014 --> 40:50.982
I'll cook us a real meal.
- I'm with that.

40:50.982 --> 40:52.751
- Me too.

40:52.751 --> 40:54.019
- Hey, Sergeant.

40:54.019 --> 40:56.655
You--you want to join us?

40:56.655 --> 40:59.324
- Uh, rain check.
Paperwork.

40:59.324 --> 41:01.392
- Meet you up there.

41:04.630 --> 41:06.532
Paperwork can wait.

41:08.166 --> 41:09.535
- Yeah.

41:13.438 --> 41:16.341
Lily's parents...

41:16.341 --> 41:18.544
They're never gonna
get over this, are they?

41:18.544 --> 41:20.178
- Losing a child?

41:20.178 --> 41:22.180
No.

41:22.180 --> 41:24.983
- You have a kid.

41:24.983 --> 41:27.018
That's got to make this job
harder.

41:28.687 --> 41:32.157
- Yeah, it does.

41:32.157 --> 41:34.860
You know, Dodds, I'm gonna
tell you something

41:34.860 --> 41:40.699
that I wish somebody had told me
after my first tough case.

41:40.699 --> 41:43.201
Go home,

41:43.201 --> 41:45.771
talk to somebody you love,

41:45.771 --> 41:49.641
and don't make this job
your whole life.
