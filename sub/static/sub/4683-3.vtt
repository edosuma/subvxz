WEBVTT

00:19.900 --> 00:22.500
I'll be back!
I'm free!

00:25.666 --> 00:27.566
No!

00:54.900 --> 00:56.933
Chris, you're not
nervous, are ya?

00:58.433 --> 01:01.533
Come on, it's not like
you've never raced me before.

01:03.333 --> 01:05.533
Never lost to me before.

01:07.333 --> 01:10.633
Rule number one,
never let 'em see you sweat.

01:10.700 --> 01:13.966
Runners to your mark, set..

01:34.566 --> 01:37.933
Chris, run faster, faster.

01:39.133 --> 01:40.533
Mom?

01:42.366 --> 01:44.466
Win for me, Chris.

01:44.533 --> 01:47.266
I'm trying, mom. I'm trying.

01:54.200 --> 01:56.800
I can't. I can't.

01:57.966 --> 01:59.500
I can't.

01:59.566 --> 02:01.200
Yes! Yes!

02:50.033 --> 02:52.733
I'm sorry, mom, I tried.

02:53.866 --> 02:55.533
I really did.

03:02.433 --> 03:03.433
Sorry.

03:05.200 --> 03:06.200
Yeah.

03:07.066 --> 03:09.333
Well, sorry just doesn't cut it.

03:13.233 --> 03:15.566
It's been hard lately.

03:15.633 --> 03:18.300
Since your mom died.

03:18.366 --> 03:20.733
You can't compete
with a ghost, Chris.

03:21.733 --> 03:24.166
You think I don't understand?

03:24.233 --> 03:27.200
She may have been your mom,
but she was my friend.

03:27.266 --> 03:29.466
Through school, the games..

03:29.533 --> 03:32.533
...marriage, divorce...and you.

03:33.500 --> 03:35.400
God, how she wanted you.

03:35.466 --> 03:38.133
More than any trophy or medal.

03:39.300 --> 03:42.733
I thought for sure
her running days were over.

03:42.800 --> 03:46.033
But, no.
She fought her way back.

03:47.500 --> 03:50.200
And it taught me that
you can inherit talent

03:51.400 --> 03:53.033
but not guts.

03:56.033 --> 03:58.733
- You're off the team.
- What?

03:58.800 --> 04:02.400
You don't wanna win, Chris.
You don't need it enough.

04:02.466 --> 04:03.833
And you will never
be a winner until you

04:03.900 --> 04:05.900
stop looking
over your shoulder.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.033
No..

04:30.200 --> 04:33.566
If Chris is gonna
win one for the ripper..

04:33.633 --> 04:38.233
...she'll need
a little killer instinct.

05:34.433 --> 05:37.133
Too big a book,
too nice a day.

05:44.933 --> 05:46.966
'Cutting class again,
Mr. Morris?'

05:47.033 --> 05:48.733
Uh-oh, don't tell my girlfriend.

05:48.800 --> 05:50.733
She's a jock, she'll
beat the crap of me.

05:50.800 --> 05:52.433
Cut it out.

05:54.200 --> 05:57.333
You got the bod, I got the
brains, I can live with that.

05:58.733 --> 06:00.733
How's my track star?

06:14.833 --> 06:17.166
Chris, it was just one race.

06:17.233 --> 06:20.233
No. Was the first of many.

06:21.500 --> 06:24.766
Today is the beginning
of the end.

06:24.833 --> 06:27.433
Come on, Chris,
you never quit.

06:28.900 --> 06:30.933
What's the problem?

06:31.000 --> 06:32.933
Coach says I don't wanna win.

06:33.000 --> 06:35.366
Yeah, sure.

06:35.433 --> 06:37.600
I mean, you won't even let me
beat you at a game of Scrabble.

06:37.666 --> 06:39.966
Look, all I know is,
last year I could've beat Nickie

06:40.033 --> 06:41.100
in a pair of concrete keds.

06:41.166 --> 06:42.466
This year I'm about as quick

06:42.533 --> 06:44.233
as, uh, bill through Congress.

06:45.300 --> 06:46.600
It's not funny.

06:46.666 --> 06:48.000
Ah, Chris

06:48.700 --> 06:51.033
cut yourself some slack.

06:51.100 --> 06:53.400
You have to be a droid not to
lose it after your mom died.

06:53.466 --> 06:55.833
Look, I'm not gonna hide
behind that lame excuse.

06:57.433 --> 06:59.766
I'm supposed to be a champion.

06:59.833 --> 07:01.366
Why?

07:01.433 --> 07:02.400
Because she was?

07:02.466 --> 07:03.433
No!

07:06.466 --> 07:09.066
She wanted me to be.

07:09.133 --> 07:11.333
What do you want?

07:12.933 --> 07:15.766
Chris, you could still run
win medals like she did

07:15.833 --> 07:18.366
win races like she did..

07:18.433 --> 07:19.933
...but like it or not,
you're gonna have to still

07:20.000 --> 07:23.666
face the question,
"What do&lt;TO

07:23.733 --> 07:24.700
David..

07:25.833 --> 07:27.600
...it's not that simple.

07:27.666 --> 07:29.400
Yes, it is.

07:29.466 --> 07:31.500
Look at me.

07:31.566 --> 07:33.933
I mean,
I know what I want.

07:35.133 --> 07:36.633
I want this.

07:38.600 --> 07:40.800
- I want this.
- Mm.

07:40.866 --> 07:41.900
I want this.

07:52.533 --> 07:54.600
Man's gotta know his priorities.

07:54.666 --> 07:56.033
That's right.

07:57.366 --> 07:59.633
It's time you know yours.

08:04.300 --> 08:05.600
There's no law saying

08:05.666 --> 08:07.833
you have to take over
the family business.

08:21.266 --> 08:22.900
Coach.

08:24.400 --> 08:25.766
Why are you suited up?

08:25.833 --> 08:27.333
I told you this team's
only got room for--

08:27.400 --> 08:30.066
Winners. I know.

08:31.566 --> 08:33.233
I'm ready.

08:45.266 --> 08:47.233
Go on, take it.

08:48.066 --> 08:50.266
It was your mom's.

08:50.333 --> 08:53.466
She gave it to me when
she stopped running.

08:53.533 --> 08:56.566
Before every race
she'd just stare at it

08:56.633 --> 08:59.000
visualizing the whole race

08:59.066 --> 09:01.566
She'd actually
see herself running

09:01.633 --> 09:03.366
and winning.

09:03.433 --> 09:06.133
And it worked
for her every time.

09:07.266 --> 09:10.200
I think she'd want you
to have it now.

09:10.266 --> 09:12.900
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

09:31.466 --> 09:33.033
I'm a bullet.

09:34.866 --> 09:36.233
I'm a missile.

09:37.733 --> 09:39.333
I'm a rocket to the moon.

10:02.100 --> 10:04.033
Hey, wake up.

10:04.100 --> 10:05.600
We don't wanna miss out
on any of that

10:05.666 --> 10:07.166
creamy chipped crap, do we?

10:10.500 --> 10:12.666
Has someone been giving you
gifts behind my back?

10:12.733 --> 10:14.400
No.

10:14.466 --> 10:16.266
It's a good luck charm.

10:16.333 --> 10:18.700
Yeah, with the food around here,
we're gonna need it.

10:18.766 --> 10:21.666
Well, if it isn't Wonder Woman.

10:21.733 --> 10:24.033
We gotta make sure you get
all of your vitamins

10:24.100 --> 10:25.666
'to keep that body goin'.'

10:25.733 --> 10:27.233
Just ignore him.

10:27.300 --> 10:29.633
Hey, Chris, how
about demonstratin'

10:29.700 --> 10:31.300
a few of them squat thrust?

10:31.366 --> 10:33.666
I got just the place.

10:33.733 --> 10:35.300
Hon, just tell him
what you want.

10:35.366 --> 10:37.100
I think I know what she wants.

10:37.166 --> 10:39.700
I would like a sandwich, please.

10:39.766 --> 10:43.533
Mmm, head cheese..

10:43.600 --> 10:44.600
...my favorite.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.800
Don't you ever put your
filthy fingers on me again!

10:48.866 --> 10:49.833
Hoo-hoo.

10:49.900 --> 10:51.100
Don't you ever touch her.

10:51.166 --> 10:53.133
Ooh, tough guy.

10:54.700 --> 10:55.900
Scum.

11:22.733 --> 11:23.833
Oh! God!

11:26.066 --> 11:27.500
No!

11:30.833 --> 11:32.066
David!

11:32.133 --> 11:33.100
David!

11:49.100 --> 11:50.533
Hey, David!

11:50.600 --> 11:51.700
Hey, Nick.

11:51.766 --> 11:53.933
Chris is looking
pretty good, huh?

11:54.000 --> 11:55.200
Yeah, well,
you better be careful.

11:55.266 --> 11:57.800
Last guy who touched her
lost a bunch of fingers.

11:59.000 --> 12:02.533
- Is Jay here yet?
- He's around somewhere.

12:02.600 --> 12:05.300
He's always around somewhere.

12:13.466 --> 12:15.300
Your shoe's untied.

12:20.233 --> 12:21.966
Don't you have
enough trophies already?

12:22.033 --> 12:24.100
Ooh, I like guys
who play hard to get.

12:24.166 --> 12:26.900
'Yeah, well, I'm not
playing hard to get.'

12:26.966 --> 12:29.300
- Oh?
- Just unavailable.

12:29.366 --> 12:31.466
Nobody ever has to know.

12:31.533 --> 12:34.733
- Hey, guys!
- Hey!

12:34.800 --> 12:37.400
Uh, practice, uh, went
a little longer than I figured

12:37.466 --> 12:40.100
but I gotta get ready
for karate class.

12:40.166 --> 12:42.300
Little one on one
with David.

12:45.500 --> 12:47.300
I, uh, didn't miss
anything, did I?

12:47.366 --> 12:49.233
No, nothing.

12:50.500 --> 12:52.866
I'm up next.

12:52.933 --> 12:54.833
One for luck.

12:54.900 --> 12:57.233
I don't need luck.

12:58.866 --> 13:00.833
Go get 'em!

13:00.900 --> 13:03.133
God, man, look at those glutes.

13:03.200 --> 13:05.500
You know I've got such
a case of the horns right now

13:05.566 --> 13:08.533
but it's strictly hands of
until the finals.

13:09.633 --> 13:11.066
What?

13:11.133 --> 13:12.666
Oh, while she's in training.

13:12.733 --> 13:14.366
I mean, Coach Wilson
gave strict orders.

13:14.433 --> 13:16.000
It's for her and Chris.

13:16.066 --> 13:18.600
Dude, you're getting ripped off.

13:21.166 --> 13:22.500
- Really?
- 'Yeah.'

13:35.966 --> 13:39.266
- Yes!
- Not bad, Ryan, not bad.

13:39.333 --> 13:41.400
Worry beads? You'll need 'em.

13:42.500 --> 13:43.966
You ready?

13:44.033 --> 13:45.333
Okay, you're up.

13:53.200 --> 13:55.433
I'm a bullet, I'm a missile.

13:55.500 --> 13:57.666
I'm a rocket to the moon.

14:19.933 --> 14:21.633
Yeah! Ha ha ha!

14:27.733 --> 14:29.033
Yeah!

14:31.200 --> 14:32.233
Oh!

14:35.666 --> 14:37.033
Nickie!

14:39.866 --> 14:41.966
One cannot begin to understand

14:42.033 --> 14:44.866
the events that actually led
to the Civil War

14:44.933 --> 14:49.333
without some glimmering
of comprehension of the economy.

14:50.566 --> 14:53.400
I set a new school record,
do you believe it?

14:53.466 --> 14:56.533
'Yeah, it was just
practice day that I flew.'

14:56.600 --> 14:58.366
I wish my mom was here
to see it.

14:58.433 --> 15:00.200
'Christina!'

15:00.266 --> 15:02.300
'Since you know enough
about our subject'

15:02.366 --> 15:04.233
to ignore this lesson

15:04.300 --> 15:07.466
would you like to explain
it to the class, hmm?

15:07.533 --> 15:09.066
Don't they pay you for that?

15:10.666 --> 15:13.333
Alright, Mr. Morris..

15:13.400 --> 15:16.133
...you can join Christina
in writing a 500-word essay

15:16.200 --> 15:17.966
on the Emancipation Proclamation

15:18.033 --> 15:20.900
'due on my desk in the morning.'

15:20.966 --> 15:23.600
- There goes practice.
- Dweeb.

15:24.833 --> 15:27.866
Would you care to share
that with the class?

15:27.933 --> 15:29.300
No, I'm cool.

15:30.633 --> 15:31.800
Cool.

15:33.066 --> 15:35.033
As I was saying..

15:36.066 --> 15:38.000
...in 1863

15:38.066 --> 15:40.466
the South was for all purposes

15:40.533 --> 15:43.600
a one-crop economy.
And that crop was?

15:45.266 --> 15:47.500
Anyone?

15:47.566 --> 15:49.300
Cotton.

15:49.366 --> 15:51.233
Excuse me.

15:52.533 --> 15:54.300
Yeah, but cotton was..

16:47.566 --> 16:49.500
Somebody get some help!

16:52.966 --> 16:54.633
'Are you okay?'

16:58.666 --> 17:00.333
'This is stupid.'

17:00.400 --> 17:02.866
I don't understand why
you're so hung up on Birdwell.

17:02.933 --> 17:04.566
He choked.

17:04.633 --> 17:06.033
I did it.

17:06.100 --> 17:08.600
Give me a break.

17:08.666 --> 17:11.033
I was thinking about it
just before it happened.

17:12.266 --> 17:14.566
I was picturing it
in my mind exactly what it..

17:14.633 --> 17:18.333
David, it's not the first time
it happened!

17:18.400 --> 17:20.700
The same thing
happened to Marvin!

17:20.766 --> 17:22.600
Come on, you couldn't have
anything to do with that.

17:22.666 --> 17:24.500
I did!

17:24.600 --> 17:25.933
How?

17:29.266 --> 17:31.066
The crystal.

17:31.133 --> 17:32.966
Come on, Chris,
give me a break.

17:33.033 --> 17:35.466
David, I'm serious.

17:35.533 --> 17:38.100
It makes things happen!

17:39.500 --> 17:41.800
First Birdwell..

17:41.866 --> 17:43.200
...then Marvin..

17:45.433 --> 17:46.733
...and then me.

17:48.233 --> 17:50.200
When I was running
at the track today.

17:51.266 --> 17:54.200
You don't really believe
that, do you?

17:54.266 --> 17:56.466
- David, it's all becau--
- Chris!

17:56.533 --> 18:00.300
You set that record because
you ran a great race. Period.

18:17.600 --> 18:19.833
Hey, I found out why
your mom had to quit

18:19.900 --> 18:22.266
right at the top
of her career.

18:23.366 --> 18:25.266
You interested?

18:25.333 --> 18:26.966
Not particularly.

18:27.033 --> 18:28.600
She got knocked up with you.

19:38.766 --> 19:40.900
Hey, somebody stop this thing!

19:54.366 --> 19:57.100
Chris, you feeling alright?

19:59.600 --> 20:01.600
Yeah, I was just thinking.

20:28.233 --> 20:29.633
David!

20:29.700 --> 20:31.466
- It's gone!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down!

20:31.533 --> 20:32.833
- What, what?
- The crystal, the crystal.

20:32.900 --> 20:34.933
I lost it. I don't know
what I'm gonna do.

20:35.000 --> 20:36.200
Can you go out to win the race?

20:36.266 --> 20:37.400
- No.
- Yeah.

20:37.466 --> 20:39.533
Not for your mom and not for&lt;i

20:39.600 --> 20:40.866
Especially not for that
damn crystal.

20:40.933 --> 20:44.033
- God, you don't understand--
- No, I do understand!

20:44.100 --> 20:47.000
Go out there and win this
race for yourself. Okay?

20:47.066 --> 20:48.766
- Ugh!
- Hey!

20:53.666 --> 20:54.700
Just kicking around
round the corner.

20:54.766 --> 20:56.166
Right. Just remember
to keep your head down.

20:56.233 --> 20:58.333
- Alright.
- Alright?

20:58.400 --> 21:01.066
'Chris Gordon, Nickie Ryan'

21:01.133 --> 21:03.533
'to your marks, please.'

21:03.600 --> 21:05.700
'Here we go. Alright!'

21:05.766 --> 21:07.733
- 'Yeah, yeah, nice work.'
- 'Alright!'

21:10.033 --> 21:11.800
'Go, go, go!'

21:11.866 --> 21:13.233
Feeling good?

21:14.400 --> 21:16.866
- Like a winner.
- A-ha! That's music to my ears.

21:16.933 --> 21:18.200
Go to it!

21:23.700 --> 21:26.233
Hey, Chris, what do you say
we make a little side bet, huh?

21:26.300 --> 21:27.866
Winner take all.

21:27.933 --> 21:31.033
The race...the trophy..

21:31.100 --> 21:33.000
...and David.

21:33.066 --> 21:35.233
Trust me, he won't mind.

21:37.266 --> 21:39.300
'On your marks...get, set..'

21:39.366 --> 21:40.333
- 'Show her!'
- 'Oh.'

21:44.100 --> 21:47.066
Run, run, run! Yeah!

21:54.533 --> 21:56.500
Whoa! Yeah! Go!

22:13.766 --> 22:16.333
Yeah! Go, Chris! Whoa!

22:33.233 --> 22:34.900
Chris!

22:38.200 --> 22:41.066
- 'Oh, no!'
- 'Oh, oh!'

22:41.133 --> 22:43.600
- 'Ah, oh!
- 'Oh, Chris!'

22:43.666 --> 22:45.466
- 'Chris!'
- 'Somebody get a doctor.'

22:45.533 --> 22:48.666
- 'Get a doctor!'
- 'Get a doctor, please.'

22:48.733 --> 22:51.033
- 'Somebody, oh my..'
- 'Come on.'

22:51.100 --> 22:54.133
- 'Chris!'
- 'Do something!'

22:55.933 --> 22:58.800
- Chris! Chris, you okay?
- Where is it?

22:58.866 --> 23:00.766
- Over here.
- Somebody call the doctor.

23:00.833 --> 23:04.066
- No, no, no!
- Chris, Chris, Chris?

23:04.133 --> 23:05.333
'Don't anybody touch her.'

23:05.400 --> 23:07.366
'Oh, somebody call a doctor.'

23:07.433 --> 23:08.866
'It looks like
she's got a broken neck.'

23:08.933 --> 23:11.100
- 'Stay back, stay back.'
- 'Everyone stay back.'

23:12.033 --> 23:14.566
Somebody call for help.

23:14.633 --> 23:17.133
- Is she okay?
- The paramedic's over here.

23:17.200 --> 23:19.300
Come on, stand back, everybody.
Just stay back.

23:19.366 --> 23:21.566
- Move back.
- Stay back.

23:21.633 --> 23:23.400
I'm gonna get,
I'm gonna get some help.

23:23.466 --> 23:24.833
We'll be right back.

23:55.233 --> 23:57.833
The killer victory.

23:57.900 --> 24:01.033
The agony...of dead meat.

24:26.700 --> 24:28.266
David!

24:28.333 --> 24:29.966
- It's gone!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow down!

24:30.033 --> 24:31.300
- What, what?
- The crystal! The crystal.

24:31.366 --> 24:33.300
I lost it. I don't know
what I'm gonna do.

24:59.900 --> 25:01.300
Chris!

25:13.633 --> 25:17.233
Chris! Chris! Chris! Chris!

25:17.300 --> 25:18.600
Chris!

26:33.266 --> 26:35.233
I love you, David.

26:37.000 --> 26:38.433
Chris?

26:39.633 --> 26:41.600
I came to say goodbye.

26:42.200 --> 26:43.333
Goodbye?

26:44.366 --> 26:46.066
Don't leave me.

26:46.133 --> 26:48.433
Don't go away, please.
This is not fair.

26:49.366 --> 26:51.300
Nickie doesn't play fair.

26:52.833 --> 26:54.200
Nickie?

26:54.266 --> 26:56.300
What does Nickie have to d
with this?

26:57.800 --> 27:00.133
She did this to me.

27:00.200 --> 27:02.233
She made me fall.

27:03.366 --> 27:04.633
What?

27:06.333 --> 27:07.633
Help me.

27:10.033 --> 27:11.433
Make her pay.

27:12.733 --> 27:14.800
Please. Help me.

27:19.600 --> 27:20.700
Promise?

27:22.033 --> 27:23.200
Promise me.

27:24.133 --> 27:25.400
I promise.

27:53.200 --> 27:56.033
'Chris Gordon died

27:53.200 --> 27:56.033
doing what she loved most.'

27:56.833 --> 27:58.233
Running.

27:58.300 --> 28:00.166
It was her greatest joy

28:00.233 --> 28:02.333
and anyone
who ever saw Chris race

28:02.400 --> 28:04.300
'knew that when she was running'

28:04.366 --> 28:06.933
'was when
she was the most alive.'

28:07.000 --> 28:10.033
'And even though
she lost that last race..'

28:10.100 --> 28:12.433
'...those of us who loved her'

28:12.500 --> 28:15.100
should take comfort
in knowing that

28:15.166 --> 28:17.200
she won the ultimate race

28:17.266 --> 28:18.800
to the kingdom of heaven.

28:20.266 --> 28:22.366
And when Chris
enters the gates of heaven

28:22.433 --> 28:23.900
free at last from her worldly..

28:23.966 --> 28:25.366
What the hell is she doing here?

28:25.433 --> 28:27.000
I just came
to pay my respect.

28:27.066 --> 28:28.333
Jay, take her home.

28:28.400 --> 28:29.900
'And without
the Earth's gravity..'

28:29.966 --> 28:31.266
David, you're not being fair.

28:31.333 --> 28:32.400
'Yeah? Well, now we're even.'

28:32.466 --> 28:34.833
'...competition
on her young shoulders'

28:34.900 --> 28:36.400
'she will
not have to be content'

28:36.466 --> 28:37.766
to merely race like the wind

28:37.833 --> 28:40.533
she will be racing
with the wind.

28:40.600 --> 28:42.066
Not stained with sin

28:42.133 --> 28:43.800
like the blasphemer
and fornicator

28:43.866 --> 28:45.833
who stands among us now.

28:45.900 --> 28:49.700
Chris Gordon's murderer,
Nickie Ryan!

28:51.200 --> 28:52.866
'In a way, Chris was a saint.'

28:52.933 --> 28:56.566
'She struggled and sacrificed
as all saints must.'

28:56.633 --> 28:57.966
And it was that spirit

28:58.033 --> 28:59.800
that in those final moment
of her life

28:59.866 --> 29:01.433
that ultimately triumphed.

29:01.500 --> 29:02.833
For it is that spirit

29:02.900 --> 29:05.433
that made Chris
not only a winner on the track

29:05.500 --> 29:08.233
but a champion
in her life as well.

29:08.300 --> 29:10.233
May she rest in peace.

29:22.900 --> 29:23.933
You take care.

30:10.766 --> 30:12.433
Game ain't over

30:12.500 --> 30:14.500
till the fat lady..

30:14.566 --> 30:15.933
...dies.

30:26.266 --> 30:27.600
All clear.

31:16.066 --> 31:18.333
It's hard to believe
she's gone, isn't it?

31:18.400 --> 31:19.733
Is it?

31:21.000 --> 31:22.300
Look, I know
it's only been a week

31:22.366 --> 31:24.700
and I know
you're still hurting, but.

31:24.766 --> 31:26.366
...whenever something
really awful happens to me

31:26.433 --> 31:28.133
it always helps
if I reach way down inside

31:28.200 --> 31:30.066
and try to find something good
to wring out the pain.

31:30.133 --> 31:31.900
Hm.

31:31.966 --> 31:33.333
I mean, I know
this must sound pretty lam

31:33.400 --> 31:35.333
but it works for me.

31:39.300 --> 31:40.333
You know, after the way
you treated me

31:40.400 --> 31:42.700
at the funeral, David..

31:42.766 --> 31:44.733
...I cried all the way home.

31:45.800 --> 31:47.100
Ask Jay.

31:48.633 --> 31:50.833
David, come on.

31:50.900 --> 31:52.433
Ever since we were kids,
all the other kids

31:52.500 --> 31:54.700
we grew up with at Springwood
are gone.

31:56.233 --> 31:58.200
We're all we've got left.

31:59.800 --> 32:01.800
Not much, is it?

32:08.900 --> 32:10.333
Ready position.

32:10.400 --> 32:12.700
Attention.

32:12.766 --> 32:13.900
Salute.

32:13.966 --> 32:15.466
'Fighting stances.'

32:15.533 --> 32:17.633
Ready position.

32:17.700 --> 32:19.733
Attention. Salute.

32:19.800 --> 32:21.700
Face each other. Ready position.

32:21.766 --> 32:22.833
Attention.

32:23.833 --> 32:25.833
'Salute. Fighting stances.'

32:27.233 --> 32:29.200
Turn! Fighting stance.

32:31.933 --> 32:33.366
Begin.

32:35.800 --> 32:37.566
Break!
Begin!

32:40.366 --> 32:41.900
Break.

32:41.966 --> 32:43.600
Fighting stance. Position.

32:44.200 --> 32:45.200
'Ready?'

32:46.900 --> 32:48.033
Fighting stance.

32:49.333 --> 32:50.666
Ready.

32:50.733 --> 32:52.033
Begin.

32:55.933 --> 32:57.766
'Begin.'

33:01.733 --> 33:02.966
You kill my girlfriend

33:03.033 --> 33:04.033
I kill your boyfriend.

33:05.800 --> 33:07.100
Works for me.

33:35.766 --> 33:38.400
You're not into this,
are you?

33:38.466 --> 33:40.200
- You know, just hold me, okay?
- Yeah.

33:40.266 --> 33:42.700
Let's just sit here for a while.

33:42.766 --> 33:44.733
Hey, I've got no complaints.

33:49.400 --> 33:52.233
Jay, have you ever seen things?

33:52.300 --> 33:53.600
Seen things?

33:54.500 --> 33:57.233
Yeah. I've seen a lot of things.

33:57.300 --> 33:59.700
But I've never seen anything
as beautiful as you.

33:59.766 --> 34:01.800
No, come on!
I'm serious.

34:03.633 --> 34:05.033
Are you okay?

34:07.433 --> 34:09.266
I'm telling you,
I'm losing it, Jay.

34:09.333 --> 34:11.366
I'm seeing these really
horrible things in my mind

34:11.433 --> 34:13.500
and it's really scaring me.

34:13.566 --> 34:15.566
Look, baby,
your mind can't hurt you.

34:15.633 --> 34:18.266
You know what it is?
It's-it's because of Chris

34:18.333 --> 34:21.400
I mean, it hit us all
pretty hard, but..

34:21.466 --> 34:23.533
You gotta put it behind you.
You gotta move on.

34:23.600 --> 34:25.600
It's not letting me move on.

34:26.600 --> 34:27.700
- Oh, forget it.
- No.

34:27.766 --> 34:28.766
I mean, these things I see

34:28.833 --> 34:29.966
they're just so real and I--

34:30.033 --> 34:32.300
Shh, shh, shh.

34:32.366 --> 34:35.100
Just be in the here, in the now.

34:41.033 --> 34:43.033
You're making it
pretty hard not to.

34:43.766 --> 34:45.300
It's my pleasure.

34:46.533 --> 34:48.500
Don't ever leave me.

34:49.300 --> 34:51.233
Let anything happen, okay?

34:52.500 --> 34:54.433
I'm not going anywhere.

34:55.666 --> 34:57.233
I'm here for you.

35:10.033 --> 35:11.200
David?

35:12.000 --> 35:13.833
Look, just leave me alone.

35:13.900 --> 35:15.066
What?

35:15.133 --> 35:16.200
Look, I'm telling you
for the last time

35:16.266 --> 35:18.433
I didn't do anything.
So stop blaming me.

35:18.500 --> 35:20.033
I'm not blaming you
for anything.

35:20.100 --> 35:21.800
Yes, you are,
for what happened to Chris!

35:21.866 --> 35:23.533
No, I'm not!

35:23.600 --> 35:24.766
It's what you did to her
when she was alive

35:24.833 --> 35:26.766
is what I couldn't stand.

35:26.833 --> 35:28.766
Hey, on the field
we were competitors.

35:28.833 --> 35:31.000
Off the field we were fine.

35:31.066 --> 35:32.466
Oh, yeah?

35:32.533 --> 35:34.500
Is that why you came on to me
the other day?

35:35.566 --> 35:37.500
David, I'm sorry.

35:37.566 --> 35:40.533
I really am, but I can't
help the way I feel about you.

35:41.733 --> 35:43.366
It's not me.

35:43.433 --> 35:45.100
Never was.

35:45.166 --> 35:47.833
You couldn't stand seeing
Chris win...at anything.

35:49.366 --> 35:51.866
As for Jay, he's my friend

35:51.933 --> 35:53.766
I don't screw over my friends.

35:53.833 --> 35:55.466
Hey, I love Jay.

35:55.533 --> 35:58.100
But he doesn't understand what
I'm going through right now.

36:00.500 --> 36:02.466
'Look, maybe one night you could
come over to my house'

36:02.533 --> 36:04.500
'and we could just
sit and talk.'

36:05.633 --> 36:07.700
I mean, we both
could use somebody right now.

36:08.466 --> 36:10.433
Why don't you use Jay?

36:22.033 --> 36:23.300
'Okay, I'll see you tomorrow.'

36:32.200 --> 36:34.000
Yes.

36:34.066 --> 36:35.966
If we can make
any sort of contribution

36:36.033 --> 36:37.033
to the, uh..

36:38.366 --> 36:40.700
Well, Nickie, come here, dear.

36:40.766 --> 36:42.900
We were expecting you earlier.

36:42.966 --> 36:45.233
Nickie, you remember Mrs. Hayes?

36:45.300 --> 36:46.433
'She's been generous enough'

36:46.500 --> 36:47.866
'to make
a recommendation for you'

36:47.933 --> 36:50.400
'towards the university.'

36:57.766 --> 36:59.700
Uh, excuse me.

37:01.766 --> 37:03.533
She's been so busy.

37:03.600 --> 37:06.133
She hasn't had enough sleep,
you know, the poor dear.

37:11.866 --> 37:12.966
Now, just what the hell
was that all about?

37:13.033 --> 37:14.400
Dad, what is she doing here?

37:14.466 --> 37:16.866
That is the mayor's
wife's problem, not yours.

37:16.933 --> 37:19.100
Now, you get back in there
and apologize!

37:19.166 --> 37:20.233
- No, dad.
- Nicole, right--

37:20.300 --> 37:21.666
No, dad!

37:25.633 --> 37:27.900
What are you doing?

37:27.966 --> 37:29.933
What's wrong with you?

38:13.166 --> 38:17.100
Look, I wanna know, Nicole,
a-are you on drugs or something?

38:17.166 --> 38:20.833
PCP, LSD, steroids?

38:20.900 --> 38:22.533
Hey, you jocks
always take it, don't you?

38:22.600 --> 38:24.766
Because it makes you bigge
and faster and stronger.

38:27.833 --> 38:31.666
- Darling, there you are.
- Yeah, she's on drugs.

38:31.733 --> 38:33.533
Come on, dear,
the guests are waiting.

38:33.600 --> 38:35.066
The roast is ready,
I need you to carve.

38:35.133 --> 38:37.200
She came after me
with a knife.

38:37.266 --> 38:39.200
Uh, she's crazy
from these hormones.

38:40.300 --> 38:42.266
We'll discuss this
in the morning.

38:42.333 --> 38:44.266
Yeah, well, then morning
maybe too late.

38:44.333 --> 38:45.833
By then she maybe our son.

39:26.266 --> 39:27.700
'Nickie.'

39:36.833 --> 39:38.500
Nickie.

39:42.333 --> 39:43.633
'Nickie..'

39:45.466 --> 39:48.300
Darling, your father and I
were just wondering

39:48.366 --> 39:52.100
if perhaps...you needed a rest.

39:52.166 --> 39:53.566
You've been working
so very hard

39:53.633 --> 39:56.400
what with school, and, uh,
your track mates.

39:56.466 --> 39:57.800
And boys.

39:57.866 --> 39:59.900
And, uh, we have always
encouraged you

39:59.966 --> 40:01.900
to do your very best.

40:01.966 --> 40:04.500
Encouraged?

40:04.566 --> 40:07.433
As in pushed and then threatened
a-and manipulated?

40:07.500 --> 40:10.833
Look, everything we've done,
we've done for you.

40:10.900 --> 40:12.466
And it hasn't been cheap,
you know.

40:12.533 --> 40:15.866
Shoes, coaches, doctor bills.
I have a box full of receipts.

40:15.933 --> 40:17.600
I can show them to you.

40:17.666 --> 40:19.700
'These trophies should have
our names on them.'

40:19.766 --> 40:22.133
Those trophies are mine.

40:22.200 --> 40:24.266
They're mine!

40:24.333 --> 40:27.133
You aren't the only one
who had to pay for 'em.

40:27.200 --> 40:30.400
I am the one that had to work
for 'em and sweat for 'em.

40:30.466 --> 40:32.533
Sprained ankles
a-and blown out knees

40:32.600 --> 40:34.533
just so that you would love me.

40:35.500 --> 40:37.433
So you'd be proud of me.

40:41.166 --> 40:43.633
'How can you say that
about your mother and me?'

40:43.700 --> 40:46.300
'How can you say
we don't care?'

40:46.366 --> 40:48.400
'Nicole, I'm talking to you.'

40:49.866 --> 40:51.833
What the hell
are you doing here?

41:02.866 --> 41:04.166
Just leave me alone.

41:04.233 --> 41:07.100
We are proud of you.
We do love you.

41:10.533 --> 41:12.800
'We defy you to name
one single thing'

41:12.866 --> 41:14.100
'that we haven't done for you.'

41:15.000 --> 41:16.966
Just get outta here!

41:17.033 --> 41:19.000
Nickie, what is wrong with you?

41:28.300 --> 41:29.233
'Here you go.'

41:38.733 --> 41:41.400
I'm a bullet, I'm a missile,
I'm a rocket to the moon!

41:41.466 --> 41:43.466
I'm a bullet, I'm a missile,
I'm a rocket to the moon!

41:43.533 --> 41:45.833
I'm a bullet, I'm a missile,
I'm a rocket to the moon!

41:45.900 --> 41:47.933
Bullet! Missile! Rocket!

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
Bullet! Missile! Rocket!

41:50.066 --> 41:52.266
Bullet! Missile! Rocket!

41:52.333 --> 41:54.166
Bullet! Missile! Rocket!

41:57.066 --> 41:58.700
- 'Bullet! Missile! Rocket!'
- Nickie, get off that.

41:59.633 --> 42:01.200
No way, the race isn't over yet.

42:02.833 --> 42:04.366
'Bullet! Missile! Rocket!'

42:04.433 --> 42:06.366
What are you trying to do,
kill yourself?

42:06.433 --> 42:08.033
You know, I need to get yo
to a doctor.

42:08.100 --> 42:10.166
- No!
- Just to check you out.

42:10.233 --> 42:13.766
- No!
- Alright, alright, alright.

42:13.833 --> 42:15.600
I'll drive you home.

42:16.733 --> 42:17.700
Okay?

42:19.366 --> 42:20.900
No.

42:20.966 --> 42:22.600
No, I-I can walk home.

42:44.333 --> 42:45.800
'Nickie.'

42:49.500 --> 42:50.933
'Nickie.'

43:47.033 --> 43:49.133
David?

43:49.200 --> 43:51.133
Oh, thank God, it's you.

43:52.633 --> 43:54.133
Who were you expecting?

43:54.200 --> 43:56.533
Uh, I don't know,
but a-after the way you acted

43:56.600 --> 43:57.800
I wasn't expecting you.

43:57.866 --> 43:59.366
I had to come.

43:59.433 --> 44:00.933
I made a promise.

44:02.466 --> 44:04.033
Wait, you didn't tell Jay
about this, did you?

44:04.100 --> 44:07.233
I mean, this isn't some kind
of a loyalty thing, is it?

44:07.300 --> 44:09.233
I made a promise
to make you pay.

44:11.766 --> 44:13.000
For what?

44:13.066 --> 44:15.666
For making Chris fall...and die.

44:15.733 --> 44:18.000
I didn't make her fall,
I swear.

44:18.066 --> 44:19.600
And nobody could've seen..

44:20.833 --> 44:22.433
She knew.

44:26.266 --> 44:28.600
But she's dead.

44:28.666 --> 44:30.333
She told me.

44:41.366 --> 44:42.933
This belongs to Chris.

44:44.466 --> 44:46.033
She wants it back.

44:47.600 --> 44:48.800
This is mine.

44:48.866 --> 44:51.066
It's mine!

44:51.133 --> 44:52.800
I am a winner.

44:52.866 --> 44:54.000
I am a winner.

44:54.066 --> 44:55.300
I am a winner.

44:55.366 --> 44:56.500
I am a winner.

44:56.566 --> 44:57.800
I am a winner.

44:57.866 --> 44:59.333
I am a winner.

45:05.100 --> 45:06.900
Oh, oh.

45:06.966 --> 45:09.333
'Jay, Jay?'

45:09.400 --> 45:10.600
'Nickie?'

45:10.666 --> 45:12.700
'You don't have a boy
in there, do you?'

45:13.866 --> 45:15.333
Jay?

45:17.766 --> 45:21.033
'Jay? Jay?'

45:21.100 --> 45:23.433
As Nickie Ryan will tell you..

45:23.500 --> 45:27.200
...even dead jocks
can make a comeback.

45:34.300 --> 45:35.833
Mmm!
