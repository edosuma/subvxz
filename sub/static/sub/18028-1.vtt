01:24.185 --> 01:26.881
Ring-around-the-rosy

01:26.954 --> 01:28.888
Now, I'm trying to tell you...

01:28.956 --> 01:31.151
that we can't afford
toke you here any more.

01:31.225 --> 01:33.557
You already owe two months
worth of back rent.

01:33.628 --> 01:35.789
It's mine,
and you're not taking it away.

01:35.863 --> 01:39.924
Read the will, Nell.
It states, in plain language:

01:40.001 --> 01:42.663
"The executor shall have
the right to dispose of...

01:42.737 --> 01:45.968
any and all personal property
as he shall see fit."

01:46.040 --> 01:48.907
- He's not even real family.
- Yeah, well, may be not.

01:48.976 --> 01:52.036
But clearly, Mother thought Lou
would be much better equipped...

01:52.113 --> 01:54.581
to deal with these
unpleasant details than you.

01:54.649 --> 01:57.311
" Unpleasant details"?

01:57.385 --> 02:00.411
What have I been dealing with
for the past 11 years?

02:00.488 --> 02:03.980
I've cooked, cleaned, mopped up her urine!
You call that an "unpleasant detail"?

02:04.058 --> 02:06.822
- Hey, your sister didn't write the will.
- We all know what you've done.

02:06.894 --> 02:09.488
- We're trying to help.
- Do not help me!

02:13.067 --> 02:17.163
Oh, Ritchie.
Just go sit on the couch, okay?

02:17.238 --> 02:19.331
- Oh.

02:19.407 --> 02:21.341
Any way, once probate closes,

02:21.409 --> 02:23.343
we can put this apartment
on the market,

02:23.411 --> 02:26.005
and we all might be able
to make a few bucks.

02:26.080 --> 02:30.540
Also, we know how much you love
Mom's car, so we're giving it toyou.

02:30.618 --> 02:35.749
You're taking away my home
and giving me a 20-year-old car?

02:35.823 --> 02:39.589
Absolutely. We'll deduct the value
from the proceeds of the apartment.

02:39.660 --> 02:41.992
Who are you?

02:42.063 --> 02:46.466
Do you understand
that I have nowhere to go?

02:48.769 --> 02:52.535
We've been talking,
and Lou and I are very busy.

02:52.607 --> 02:56.941
We could use some one to help us
with the cleaning and the cooking,

02:57.011 --> 02:58.945
looking after Ritchie?

03:03.518 --> 03:08.217
Eleanor, help me. I gotta pee.

03:12.894 --> 03:15.454
Get outta my home.

03:15.530 --> 03:19.728
Well, suit your self.
We'll let the courts handle it.

03:19.800 --> 03:22.735
Get out ofmy home.

03:24.038 --> 03:26.973
Honey, let go. That's right.
Oops. Sorry. Okay.

03:29.877 --> 03:32.937
Here you go, honey.
Follow Daddy.

03:35.616 --> 03:37.846
Come live with us, Nell.

03:37.919 --> 03:39.978
You have no idea
how hard it is out there.

03:40.054 --> 03:44.388
No,Jane. You have no idea
how hard it was in here.

04:52.827 --> 04:54.761
Hello.

04:57.131 --> 04:59.463
Yes, this is Eleanor.

05:01.636 --> 05:04.935
- Where?

05:11.946 --> 05:14.073
I see it.

05:16.751 --> 05:20.187
" Research subjects.
Nine hundred a week."

05:20.254 --> 05:24.987
Here'show they're organized. The groups
have very different personalities.

05:25.059 --> 05:28.893
Scored all over the Kiersey Temperament
Sorter,just like you asked for,

05:28.963 --> 05:31.431
and they all score very high
on the insomnia charts.

05:31.499 --> 05:33.626
Oh, what a beautiful profile.

05:33.701 --> 05:36.932
A classic dependent
personality disorder.

05:37.004 --> 05:40.337
However, we were looking
for "suggestible."

05:40.408 --> 05:42.399
Her mother died
two months ago.

05:42.476 --> 05:44.637
She really wants to do this.

05:44.712 --> 05:47.374
And what are your feelings,
Mary?

05:47.448 --> 05:50.144
Tell me what
your intuitions say.

05:50.217 --> 05:52.481
I put my favorites
on top.

05:52.553 --> 05:55.579
Mm-hmm.
What else have we got here?

05:55.656 --> 05:58.989
"Low self-esteem,
high narcissism,

06:00.261 --> 06:02.126
chronic feeling of emptiness,

06:02.196 --> 06:04.130
identity disturbance. "

06:04.198 --> 06:06.666
Good, good. Verygood.

06:06.734 --> 06:08.668
Is this where we're going?

06:08.736 --> 06:11.796
That's Hill House.
That's perfect, isn't it?

06:11.872 --> 06:15.239
- The Hill House Project-- - Is absolutely
essential to my research, Malcom.

06:15.309 --> 06:17.243
No,just listen.
I grant you,

06:17.311 --> 06:22.044
fear and performance
is a big, sexy idea.

06:22.116 --> 06:26.018
- But as chairman of this department,
I cannot-- - I know you clinical guys...

06:26.087 --> 06:28.214
don't like to ask these questions,
but think about it.

06:28.289 --> 06:32.191
What is fear, anyway? It's a series of
automatic responses to a given stimulus,

06:32.259 --> 06:35.990
characterized by increased heart rate,
respiratory activity and adrenaline function.

06:36.063 --> 06:40.693
The only problem with fear is that it has
largely become inappropriate and non adaptive.

06:40.768 --> 06:43.202
Do sweaty palms
help to talk to your boss?

06:43.270 --> 06:47.798
Does a racing pulse help
some kid's score on an SAT?

06:47.875 --> 06:50.173
And yet we carry with us
these primordial fear responses...

06:50.244 --> 06:52.439
that do the opposite of what
they were intended to do.

06:52.513 --> 06:54.447
- So why is that?
- David, David, no one is saying...

06:54.515 --> 06:56.449
that these aren't
provocative questions.

06:56.517 --> 07:00.009
But you can't conduct this research
ethically or responsibly.

07:00.087 --> 07:02.555
And on top of that,
you're bringing your insomniacs...

07:02.623 --> 07:04.989
to this house
under false pretenses.

07:05.059 --> 07:08.187
Because the experiment needs a credible
cover story. Calling it an insomnia study...

07:08.262 --> 07:10.287
allows me to create a highly
suggestive environment...

07:10.364 --> 07:12.628
to investigate
the dynamics offear.

07:12.700 --> 07:18.002
You don't tell the rats they're
actually in a maze, Malcom. Come on.

08:57.571 --> 08:59.801
What do you want?

09:01.141 --> 09:03.268
Are-- Are you Mr. Dudley,
the caretaker?

09:03.344 --> 09:07.610
Yeah. I'm Mr. Dudley, the caretaker.
What are you doing here?

09:07.681 --> 09:09.615
I'm with Dr. Marrow's group.

09:09.683 --> 09:12.049
I'm supposed to see Mrs. Dudley.
Is she here?

09:12.119 --> 09:14.747
- What do you think?

09:19.994 --> 09:22.155
Why do you need
so many chains?

09:24.698 --> 09:26.825
That's a good question.

09:26.901 --> 09:28.835
What is it about fences?

09:28.903 --> 09:33.135
Sometimes the people on either side
of the fence see a locked chain,

09:33.207 --> 09:35.141
they feel
a little more comfortable.

09:35.209 --> 09:37.677
Why do you suppose that is?

10:29.630 --> 10:31.564
Mrs. Dudley?

10:33.634 --> 10:35.568
Hello?

10:46.714 --> 10:48.648
Mrs. Dudley?

11:17.144 --> 11:19.203
Hello?

11:54.281 --> 11:57.273
Hello? Mrs. Dudley?

12:09.830 --> 12:12.594
- Oh, my--

12:12.666 --> 12:15.100
I'm-- I'm, uh--
I'm Eleanor Vance.

12:15.169 --> 12:17.364
- I'm here with the
- Dr. Marrow's group.

12:17.438 --> 12:19.497
You're the first.

12:19.573 --> 12:21.768
Yeah, I'd-- I'd heard a sound,
and that's--

12:21.842 --> 12:26.302
It's make the dinner or answer the door.
Can't do both.

12:26.380 --> 12:30.680
- Are you Mrs. Dudley?
- So far.

12:30.751 --> 12:32.685
I'll show you your room.

12:35.689 --> 12:37.623
This way.

13:41.388 --> 13:43.481
The Red Room.

13:43.557 --> 13:46.788
You're going to be the first visitors
Hill House has had...

13:46.860 --> 13:50.193
- since Mr. Crain died.
- Really?

14:20.460 --> 14:22.394
These are beautiful.

14:22.462 --> 14:25.795
I know. I've seen 'em.
It's a lot to dust.

14:28.168 --> 14:31.331
I've never seen
this kind of beauty.

14:31.405 --> 14:33.771
You must love working here.

14:33.841 --> 14:36.810
I set dinner on
the dining room side boardatsix.

14:36.877 --> 14:40.938
You can serve your selves.
Breakfast is ready at nine.

14:41.014 --> 14:43.073
Idon't wait on people.

14:44.151 --> 14:46.244
I don't stay after dinner,

14:46.320 --> 14:48.754
not after it begins
to get dark.

14:48.822 --> 14:52.314
I leave...
before dark comes.

14:52.392 --> 14:55.589
We live in town--
nine miles--

14:55.662 --> 14:58.028
so there won't be anyone around
if you need help.

14:58.098 --> 15:01.261
We couldn't even hear you...
in the night.

15:01.335 --> 15:03.269
Why would we?

15:03.337 --> 15:05.271
No one could.

15:05.339 --> 15:08.001
No one lives
any nearer than town.

15:08.075 --> 15:11.044
No one will come
any nearer than that...

15:11.111 --> 15:14.080
in the night,
in the dark.

15:58.129 --> 16:01.189
You'll be staying in the north wing.

16:01.266 --> 16:04.827
Hi. Don't worry.
I'm notan obsessive packer.

16:04.903 --> 16:07.736
It's just asking people to help me
schlepp this stuffis a cheap...

16:07.806 --> 16:10.639
and exploitative way
of making new friends.

16:10.709 --> 16:12.904
- Here. I'm Theo.
- Hi.

16:12.978 --> 16:15.242
Eleanor,
but everyone calls me Nell.

16:15.313 --> 16:19.147
Well, Everyone Calls Me Nell,
don'tyou love it here?

16:19.217 --> 16:24.519
I love it. Sort ofCharles Foster Kane
meets the Munsters or something.

16:24.589 --> 16:27.080
- I like your boots.
- You do? Aren't they great?

16:27.158 --> 16:32.494
Prada. Milan, not New York.
But they're killing me.

16:32.564 --> 16:37.934
Hey, small price to pay
for such savage kicks.

16:47.546 --> 16:51.505
Wow. Oh, my God.

16:53.318 --> 16:56.082
Oh, this is so twisted.

16:57.422 --> 16:59.356
Seriously twisted.

16:59.424 --> 17:02.120
I set dinner
on the dining room side boardatsix.

17:02.193 --> 17:04.684
Breakfast is at nine.

17:04.762 --> 17:08.529
I don't stay after dinner,
not after it begins to get dark.

17:08.599 --> 17:11.228
I leave before dark comes,

17:11.303 --> 17:14.568
so there won't be any one here
if you need help.

17:14.638 --> 17:18.301
- We couldn't even hear you.
- No one could.

17:18.376 --> 17:20.570
No one lives
any nearer than town.

17:20.645 --> 17:23.375
No one will come
any nearer than that.

17:23.448 --> 17:25.382
In the night.

17:25.450 --> 17:29.113
- In the dark.
In the dark.

17:39.598 --> 17:42.066
My bedroom's
right next door to yours.

17:44.402 --> 17:46.461
I thinkwe share
the same bathroom.

17:46.538 --> 17:49.006
Oh, don't worry.
I probably won't be in here much.

17:49.074 --> 17:52.407
- Light sleeper.
- That's why we're here.

17:53.945 --> 17:56.937
- What do you do, Eleanor?
- I'm between jobs right now.

17:57.015 --> 18:00.746
The last person I was workin' for,
it ended. Over, so-- And you?

18:00.819 --> 18:03.287
Well, that depends.

18:03.355 --> 18:05.653
I'm supposed
to be an artist,

18:05.724 --> 18:08.591
but I've been distracted
from work by love.

18:08.660 --> 18:11.151
- You know what I mean?
- Mmm, not really.

18:11.229 --> 18:14.130
Hey, don't tell me Boston's
different from New York.

18:14.199 --> 18:16.167
Oh, you mean you have trouble
with commitment.

18:17.836 --> 18:21.135
Well, my boyfriend thinks so,
my girlfriend doesn't.

18:22.774 --> 18:26.904
If we could all live together--
But they hate each other.

18:26.978 --> 18:28.912
Hello. The bag.

18:28.980 --> 18:33.815
You know, it's hard when
you're the only one at the party.

18:33.885 --> 18:36.285
- You know what I mean?
- No.

18:37.622 --> 18:39.556
A blank canvas.

18:39.624 --> 18:42.957
I could paint your portrait
directly on you.

18:44.929 --> 18:46.863
Or may be not.

18:47.932 --> 18:49.866
So, what about you?

18:51.403 --> 18:54.338
Husbands? Boyfriends?

18:55.774 --> 18:58.470
Girlfriends, Eleanor?

18:59.577 --> 19:01.738
Where do you live?

19:01.813 --> 19:04.179
Mmm. I don't have anyone.

19:05.483 --> 19:08.145
But I do have
a little apartment of my own.

19:08.219 --> 19:10.153
It has a little flower garden.

19:10.221 --> 19:12.849
You can just see the ocean.
And when the wind...

19:12.924 --> 19:16.018
comes injust right,
you can hear the buoys in the harbor.

19:17.696 --> 19:21.393
Wow.
That sounds really nice.

19:22.934 --> 19:26.370
You're lucky.
But you know that, right?

19:27.906 --> 19:29.840
Oh, sorry.

19:29.908 --> 19:32.604
Just a little hair.

19:32.677 --> 19:34.702
So, show me the bathroom!

19:34.779 --> 19:38.146
Oh, it's really beautiful.

19:38.216 --> 19:41.208
It is huge.

19:41.286 --> 19:44.551
- Oh, my God!
- This is the bathroom.

19:44.622 --> 19:47.819
- Look at this bathtub. Can you believe it?

19:47.892 --> 19:49.826
Look at that. Wow!

19:49.894 --> 19:52.021
Look at my bedroom, though.

19:53.098 --> 19:55.157
- Isn't it beautiful?
- Yes.

19:55.333 --> 19:58.734
- You'vegot tosee the Great Hall.
- Uh-huh.

19:58.803 --> 20:01.237
I mean, there's so much carving.
It's everywhere.

20:01.306 --> 20:03.240
- I know.
- Oh, look at this one.

20:03.308 --> 20:06.277
- Isn't this one great?
- No, that's creepy.

20:06.344 --> 20:08.938
Oh, and this one.
This one's weird.

20:14.419 --> 20:18.753
Well, you don't get this
from the Martha Stewart catalog.

20:19.824 --> 20:21.758
Idon'tlikeit.

20:21.826 --> 20:26.354
Isn't it based on
The Gates of Hell by Rodin?

20:26.431 --> 20:31.130
Well, it's not just hell. See, the
children, they're reaching for heaven,

20:31.202 --> 20:34.262
but their souls
are trapped in purgatory.

20:38.276 --> 20:40.471
And these are the demons...

20:44.315 --> 20:47.216
who can hold on toyour soul
for as long as they want.

20:47.285 --> 20:49.549
Did you study art?

20:49.621 --> 20:53.990
No, I studied purgatory.
I was there once for 11 years.

20:57.262 --> 20:59.730
It's when your soul is caught
between the living and the dead.

20:59.798 --> 21:02.699
Oh, yeah, I've been there.

21:02.767 --> 21:05.895
It's an 18-hour flight from L.A.
to Paris, and you're stuck in coach.

21:08.306 --> 21:10.240
Do you see?

21:13.411 --> 21:16.278
Well, let's not stand here.
Come on.

21:16.347 --> 21:18.781
Okay.

21:28.059 --> 21:30.084
Whoa.

21:36.167 --> 21:38.601
- Is it real?
- No.

21:43.408 --> 21:46.434
- Shall we go in?
- Yeah.

21:57.222 --> 21:59.156
Wow!

22:07.966 --> 22:09.900
Whoo!

22:16.074 --> 22:18.702
It's beautiful!

22:18.776 --> 22:20.869
Oh!

22:24.749 --> 22:26.683
- Would you care to dance?
- Yes.

22:28.753 --> 22:32.314
I'm starting to like this house!

22:32.390 --> 22:34.984
This is great!

22:38.062 --> 22:40.428
Let's get outta here.

22:46.971 --> 22:50.998
God! We're like rats--
rats in a maze.

22:51.075 --> 22:53.737
Oh, God!
If I ruin these boots--

22:53.811 --> 22:55.745
Jesus, they cost me
a fortune.

22:55.813 --> 22:59.271
-Let's go back.
-It's gotta be through here

22:59.350 --> 23:02.615
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- That's all right.

23:02.687 --> 23:06.589
Oh. Hey, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to scare you.

23:06.658 --> 23:10.788
I'm Luke Sanderson,
just a bad sleeper.

23:10.862 --> 23:13.558
Basic tosser-turner.
And you are?

23:13.631 --> 23:16.498
- Nell Vance.
- What kind of sleeper? Nightmares?

23:16.567 --> 23:18.501
- Not really.
- Anxiety attacks?

23:18.569 --> 23:20.628
No

23:20.705 --> 23:22.935
Okay.
Obsessive indecision.

23:23.007 --> 23:26.773
Wow. And you?
Let me think.

23:26.844 --> 23:28.903
You, I'm gonna guess,
are a--

23:28.980 --> 23:31.141
Don't even start.

23:33.017 --> 23:35.144
Wow, you're so dominant.

23:36.220 --> 23:38.882
Thanks. Theo.

23:38.957 --> 23:41.016
Hey, Theo.

23:51.703 --> 23:53.694
Jesus.

23:53.771 --> 23:55.705
Here we are.

23:59.510 --> 24:01.375
- Hey.
- You're Luke.

24:01.446 --> 24:03.539
- Yup.
- You're Theo. You're Eleanor.

24:03.614 --> 24:05.548
- Hi, I'm Dr. Marrow.
- Hi.

24:05.616 --> 24:07.550
- Welcome. - Hi. -
Hello, Dr. Marrow.

24:07.618 --> 24:10.212
- Hi. This is Todd. He's just come up.
- Greetings, fellow insomniac.

24:10.288 --> 24:13.519
Mary Lambetta, my assistant.
So how was your drive, Eleanor?

24:13.591 --> 24:16.583
- It was fine. Yeah.
- Good. Good.

24:19.864 --> 24:23.459
Welcome to Hill House, everyone.
Come on.

24:23.534 --> 24:25.832
Allright.
Let the good times roll.

24:40.752 --> 24:42.435
Do you know what?
The rest of you may hate your insomnia,

24:42.436 --> 24:44.118
Do you know what?
There stof you may hate your insomnia,

24:44.188 --> 24:47.021
but I'm not sure
I want a cure for mine.

24:47.091 --> 24:50.583
That's when I get all my best ideas,
when I'm waiting to fall asleep.

24:50.661 --> 24:54.859
I'm alone, occasionally,
with no distractions,

24:55.933 --> 24:58.299
my mind's racing
with creative ideas,

24:58.369 --> 25:01.668
00 a.m.,
I feel like a genius.

25:01.739 --> 25:03.673
Are you kidding me?
00 a.m. I start to feel...

25:03.741 --> 25:07.336
like I'm losing my mind, watching those
in fomercials on psychics...

25:07.412 --> 25:11.212
or listening to Tony Robbins
and the psychic hot lines.

25:11.282 --> 25:14.581
-Have you ever seen that late-night TV?
-Oh, yeah. Thankyou.

25:14.652 --> 25:17.450
I swear to God.
You get a steady diet of that crap,

25:17.522 --> 25:19.752
and pretty soon you start thinking
about movin' to Montana...

25:19.824 --> 25:22.258
- and becomin' a survivalist.

25:22.326 --> 25:24.419
That's why God
created barbiturates, honey.

25:24.495 --> 25:26.895
- Nembutal?
- Mm-mm.

25:26.964 --> 25:31.128
No, Todd, I think we have
a classic Seconal woman on our hands.

25:31.202 --> 25:36.265
- In fact, I think I see a little Jackie Susann in Theo.

25:38.476 --> 25:40.671
- Ow.
Allright, you two.

25:40.745 --> 25:44.545
- Enough about pharmaceuticals.

25:45.683 --> 25:48.777
So, look,
what do we all need in life?

25:48.853 --> 25:52.550
- What are the basics? Food, water, shelter.
- Sex.

25:54.358 --> 25:57.054
And sleep. Sleep.

25:57.128 --> 26:00.325
I'm working on a five-year study,
with the help of Mary here,

26:00.398 --> 26:03.026
making profiles
of bad sleepers.

26:03.101 --> 26:06.264
I'm looking for
a common psychological link.

26:06.337 --> 26:11.365
I hope that the work we do here will someday be able
to help other people like your selves.

26:11.442 --> 26:15.003
God knows I'm all for helping people,
saving the world,

26:15.079 --> 26:18.776
but doesn't everybody have
a problem sleeping these days?

26:18.850 --> 26:21.080
Life's too frantic.

26:21.152 --> 26:23.086
What about you, Nell?

26:24.789 --> 26:28.589
Um, well, it seems that
you all have trouble sleeping,

26:28.659 --> 26:30.650
because your lives
are exciting,

26:30.728 --> 26:33.060
and it's complicated, and you think
about it when you go to sleep.

26:33.131 --> 26:36.623
But, um, I don't know.
Nothing's ever really happened to me,

26:36.701 --> 26:38.635
so I don't have a reason
to sleep badly.

26:38.703 --> 26:42.696
But in your application
you said you had trouble sleeping.

26:42.773 --> 26:45.503
Mm-hmm, yes,
but it's not like them.

26:45.576 --> 26:49.012
It's because, uh, there was
always somebody calling me,

26:49.080 --> 26:51.105
there was always
somebody banging.

26:52.383 --> 26:56.342
Ever since I was little,
I took care of my mother.

26:56.420 --> 27:01.187
And-- And she would wake up
in the middle of the night.

27:01.259 --> 27:04.786
She would bang with her cane
on the wall.

27:04.862 --> 27:08.298
And it was just
this relentless--

27:08.366 --> 27:11.494
it was a relentless banging
all through the night.

27:12.837 --> 27:16.398
That's weird, because even though,
uh, she's dead,

27:16.474 --> 27:18.908
I still hear it
and I wake up.

27:25.383 --> 27:29.319
Well, that's why we're here,
Eleanor-- to try and help you.

27:29.387 --> 27:31.548
Yeah, Nell. I think what Dr. Marrow's
trying to say is...

27:31.622 --> 27:34.819
that you're a basket case,
just like the rest of us.

27:42.233 --> 27:44.167
Thankyou, Mary.

27:49.407 --> 27:53.673
Okay. Okay.
Why are we here?

27:53.744 --> 27:55.803
Really, to answer
:

27:55.880 --> 27:58.576
- What is wrong with you people?

27:58.649 --> 28:01.675
These are standard
cognitive and perception tests.

28:01.752 --> 28:04.585
I'll be giving you a variety of these
during the course of the week.

28:04.655 --> 28:09.649
You are not in competition, so donot
worry about being the head of the class, okay?

28:09.727 --> 28:12.787
Between all these tests,
you'll have each other--

28:12.863 --> 28:15.195
Todd-- and the house
to keep you company.

28:15.266 --> 28:17.257
Luke. Eleanor.

28:18.769 --> 28:22.170
- But we can't go to town.
- No.

28:22.240 --> 28:25.232
And as you were told, there's no
telephone service, there's no TV.

28:25.309 --> 28:28.574
And the caretakers tend to lock the gate
when they leave. However,

28:30.381 --> 28:35.080
I do have my trusty cell telephone,
in case of emergencies, okay?

28:35.152 --> 28:39.953
And, um, what's the deal with the Addams
Family mansion? Because, I gotta be honest,

28:40.024 --> 28:43.858
- I don't get a real strong sleep vibe from this place.
- No. Me too.

28:43.928 --> 28:46.055
I wanted to make sure
you didn't sleep too easily.

28:46.130 --> 28:49.691
-Congratulations.
- Seriously, isolation is essential...

28:49.767 --> 28:52.201
in the creation
ofan experimental model.

28:52.370 --> 28:55.430
This house, who built it?
Who lived here?

28:55.506 --> 28:59.306
Well, actually, that makes
for a very good bed time story.

29:01.312 --> 29:05.373
Once upon a time,
there was a king who built a castle.

29:05.449 --> 29:07.383
His name was Hugh Crain.

29:07.451 --> 29:09.646
A hundred and thirty years ago,

29:09.720 --> 29:13.281
towns like Concord and Manchester
were the center of American industry.

29:13.357 --> 29:15.325
That's where Crain
made a fortune--

29:15.393 --> 29:17.588
on the backs of workers
in his textile mills.

29:17.662 --> 29:20.187
Now, this man could have
anything he wanted,

29:20.264 --> 29:22.596
but what he wanted
more than anything...

29:22.667 --> 29:24.601
was a house filled
with the laughter of children.

29:24.669 --> 29:28.070
That's why there are
all the carvings.

29:28.139 --> 29:31.267
He married the most beautiful
woman in town, called Rene,

29:31.342 --> 29:34.709
and he built her this house,
or at least some of it.

29:34.779 --> 29:37.270
God, it sounds like
a fairy tale or something.

29:37.348 --> 29:39.282
But that's where the fairy tale ends.

29:39.350 --> 29:42.148
Hugh and Rene
would have no children.

29:42.219 --> 29:45.052
They all died at birth.

29:45.122 --> 29:47.682
Then, a fewyears later,
Rene, she passed away,

29:47.758 --> 29:49.988
and Crain became
a total recluse.

29:50.061 --> 29:53.997
But he kept on building,
adding room upon room.

29:54.065 --> 29:58.468
It's as if he was--he was building a
home for the family he would never have.

29:58.536 --> 30:00.868
No one had seen
Crain for years.

30:00.938 --> 30:04.032
But the towns people said
that sometimes at night...

30:04.108 --> 30:07.407
they could hear sounds
coming from the old house.

30:08.479 --> 30:10.845
Sounds of children.

30:16.475 --> 30:19.239
So sad.

30:19.311 --> 30:22.508
Jesus Christ!

30:25.818 --> 30:28.582
Christ, I need a drink.

30:29.955 --> 30:33.118
I think there's more to that story.

30:34.193 --> 30:37.651
I can feel it.
I-It's all around us.

30:38.764 --> 30:40.698
It's in the ceiling.

30:40.766 --> 30:42.791
It's in the walls.

30:42.868 --> 30:44.802
It's in the furniture.

30:46.038 --> 30:47.972
It's in this.

30:51.410 --> 30:54.470
- Mary!
- Oh,Jesus. Oh, no.

30:56.182 --> 30:58.548
- Oh,Jesus Christ.
- All right.

30:58.617 --> 31:01.051
What happened?
Let me see. Oh, my God!

31:01.120 --> 31:02.985
- Keep your hand away from it.
- Don't touch it.

31:03.055 --> 31:06.786
- What were you doing?
- This'll stop the blood from getting into her eye.

31:06.859 --> 31:09.054
Mary, we're going to get you
to the hospital straight away.

31:09.128 --> 31:12.188
It's gonna be all right.
It's gonna be okay.

31:12.264 --> 31:14.323
- Come on.

31:14.400 --> 31:17.130
Three steps.

31:17.203 --> 31:19.899
Please!

31:19.972 --> 31:22.907
It's all right. It's all right.

31:27.246 --> 31:30.738
- Careful. Be careful.
- Here's the gate key to get back in.

31:30.816 --> 31:33.649
You have my cell number. Call me
the second you've spoken to a doctor.

31:33.719 --> 31:36.279
- All right, Dr. Marrow.
- Hey, I want you guys back as soon as possible.

31:36.355 --> 31:38.880
- Okay, Mary?
- Okay.

31:38.958 --> 31:40.892
You'll be all right.

31:47.833 --> 31:50.301
She almost lost her eye.

31:50.369 --> 31:52.894
Almost.

31:52.972 --> 31:55.839
Luke, there's something
about the house,

31:55.908 --> 31:58.172
about Hugh Crain
that I didn't say.

31:58.244 --> 32:00.735
- May I ask you not to tell the women?
- Yeah, yeah.

32:00.813 --> 32:04.442
- It's just I didn't want the tests disturbed.
- Okay, sure.

32:04.517 --> 32:08.009
Hey, you guys, wait up.

32:08.087 --> 32:11.579
Okay. You guys wanna hear something
really scary? I just found this out.

32:13.159 --> 32:15.889
Turns out there's a darker chapter
to the Hugh Crain fairy tale.

32:15.961 --> 32:17.895
Remember his lovely wife,
Rene?

32:17.963 --> 32:22.923
Well, Rene, the town beauty,
she didn't just die. She killed herself.

32:23.002 --> 32:25.436
- Really? He just told you that?
- Yes.

32:25.504 --> 32:27.870
And you can't say anything,
'cause he actually swore me to secrecy.

32:27.940 --> 32:30.932
-Why did she kill herself?
-Well, there are the stillborn children,

32:31.010 --> 32:32.944
although I like to think
it was more sinister,

32:33.012 --> 32:35.242
like maybe Hugh Crain was
a horrible monster and drove her to it.

32:35.314 --> 32:38.112
Monster? But he built this house
for the woman that he loved,

32:38.184 --> 32:40.118
like the Taj Mahal.

32:40.186 --> 32:42.552
The Taj Mahal wasn't a palace.
It was a tomb.

32:42.621 --> 32:45.647
And equally overdone.

32:45.724 --> 32:48.716
- Why didn't he tell us?
- Maybe he doesn't trust women.

32:48.794 --> 32:51.627
Yeah.
I think that's probably it.

32:51.697 --> 32:55.497
I think he knew that your fragile,
delicate sensibilities--

32:55.568 --> 32:59.766
After all, you know, I'm a man.
I can handle this kind of

32:59.839 --> 33:01.773
How'd she kill herself?

33:01.841 --> 33:03.900
He didn't say.

33:05.311 --> 33:07.973
Oh, and ladies,
sleep tight.

33:13.052 --> 33:14.986
Jesus.

33:15.087 --> 33:19.581
After dinner and the first bland history
of Hill House successfully relayed,

33:19.658 --> 33:23.424
Miss Vance appears most susceptible
to suggestive history,

33:23.495 --> 33:27.591
evincing a strongly sentimental reaction
to the love-story component.

33:27.666 --> 33:31.363
Mr. Sanderson, who tested at the bottom
of the Mogel Reliability Scale,

33:31.437 --> 33:34.099
was given the second part
of the story.

33:34.173 --> 33:37.768
When he passes the story on,
the experimental haunting fiction...

33:37.843 --> 33:40.778
should manifest it self
within the group.

33:46.185 --> 33:49.120
And dear Mary
almost lost an eye.

34:20.119 --> 34:22.053
I like the way
you comb your hair like that.

34:29.128 --> 34:32.393
Here. This is for you.

34:32.464 --> 34:34.398
- For me?
- Yeah.

34:36.735 --> 34:39.260
It's beautiful.

34:40.806 --> 34:42.739
- No, I'll-- I'll do it.
- It's okay.

34:42.808 --> 34:45.333
It's okay.

34:45.411 --> 34:47.344
Mm-hmm.

34:53.351 --> 34:55.786
- Looks good on you.
- Mm-hmm.

34:58.657 --> 35:01.455
You've been out of the world
a long time, haven't you?

35:02.861 --> 35:04.795
Yeah.

35:08.200 --> 35:11.135
Well,
the world's missed you.

35:12.738 --> 35:14.865
Happy tossing and turning.

35:50.609 --> 35:52.634
Eleanor.

36:08.460 --> 36:11.793
Now lay me down to sleep.

36:11.864 --> 36:15.595
I pray the Lord
my soul to keep.

36:15.667 --> 36:18.830
If Ishould die
before I wake,

36:18.904 --> 36:22.431
I pray the Lord
my soul to take.

36:35.254 --> 36:39.350
- God! You scared the f--
- I'm sorry.

36:39.425 --> 36:42.223
- Oh, you gotta be careful.
- Are you all right?

36:42.294 --> 36:45.661
- I'm sorry. - Oh, no, no,
no. You just don't jump out--

36:45.731 --> 36:48.564
- Are you all right?
- Uh, yeah. N-N-No. Oh!

36:48.634 --> 36:50.693
- What's with the, uh, glove?
- What?

36:50.769 --> 36:54.364
- What's with the glove? - No, I
couldn't sleep. I was just-- Insomnia.

36:54.440 --> 36:56.567
- What's with--
- Ah, well

36:56.642 --> 36:59.475
- Yeah, you gotta be careful, 'cause I--
- I wasn't. I was just--

36:59.545 --> 37:01.479
No, I know.
I'm sorry. I just--

37:01.547 --> 37:04.482
- Oh!
- Um, interesting group, huh?

37:04.550 --> 37:06.950
Yeah, yeah, yeah. It was good.
Kind of-- I like Theo.

37:07.019 --> 37:10.682
She's...
quite an insomniac.

37:10.756 --> 37:13.554
Well, uh, listen, you should try
and get some sleep, huh?

37:13.625 --> 37:16.355
- Yeah, that's a good idea. All right.
- Okay. See you tomorrow.

37:16.428 --> 37:18.794
- All right. There's some good
hall ways that way. - Uh-huh.

37:18.864 --> 37:20.798
- How's this one?
- Not bad.

37:20.866 --> 37:22.800
- Good. Good.
- See you tomorrow.

37:22.868 --> 37:24.802
Okay.

38:03.075 --> 38:05.009
Coming, Mother.

38:05.077 --> 38:09.707
- I'm coming.

38:22.227 --> 38:24.286
Nell! Nell!

38:34.706 --> 38:36.606
Nell! Nell!

38:36.675 --> 38:38.609
- What is it?
- I don't know.

38:38.677 --> 38:40.941
- Where's it coming from?
- It's everywhere.

39:18.016 --> 39:20.678
Oh, my God.
What's happening?

39:22.020 --> 39:25.615
- Can you feel it, Nell?
- Mm-hmm.

39:25.691 --> 39:28.751
The cold, can you feel it?
Nell, can you feel it?

39:28.827 --> 39:30.761
Oh.

39:41.640 --> 39:44.370
- Nell?

39:50.916 --> 39:52.850
It's moving.

40:03.028 --> 40:05.258
It's over.

40:05.330 --> 40:07.264
It's over, right?

40:14.406 --> 40:16.533
Nell, come back here.

40:26.652 --> 40:28.586
- Come back here!
- No, it's in my room.

40:28.654 --> 40:31.782
It's in my room.

40:36.194 --> 40:38.788
You guys all right?

40:38.864 --> 40:42.356
- Hey, is every thing okay?
- Oh, God.

40:42.434 --> 40:44.368
It's Luke.

40:50.575 --> 40:52.509
Hey, is everything okay?

40:52.577 --> 40:55.978
- You guys all right?
- Luke! Oh, God.

40:56.048 --> 40:57.982
- What's going on?
- Did you hear it?

40:58.050 --> 41:00.518
- Yeah, I just heard it. I--
- W-W-Was it part of the experiment?

41:00.585 --> 41:02.450
- Was what part of the experiment?
- The noise!

41:02.521 --> 41:05.149
- What did you hear?
- Theo, all I heard was you screaming,

41:05.223 --> 41:07.157
" Luke, help me, please."

41:09.227 --> 41:11.161
I wasn't screaming for you.

41:14.733 --> 41:18.533
- It was in my room, and then it went into Nel"s room.
- Here, let me look.

41:22.808 --> 41:24.742
- Are there any lights?
- Yes.

41:27.412 --> 41:30.245
I don't-- I don't see anything.
I don't hear anything.

41:36.722 --> 41:39.384
Wow, I sort of got screwed
on the old bedroom selection.

41:39.458 --> 41:43.053
Every room's, like,
four times as big as mine.

41:53.572 --> 41:57.633
- Is that it? Is that what you heard?

41:57.709 --> 42:00.940
Well, I did just take a bath.
I mean, could've been.

42:01.012 --> 42:04.607
Yeah, but then how doy ou explain
the breath and the cold?

42:04.683 --> 42:08.346
I don't know. A draft. Maybe someone
left a window open somewhere.

42:08.420 --> 42:10.513
The cold,
who felt it first?

42:10.589 --> 42:12.921
- Oh, I think it was me.
- What difference does it make?

42:12.991 --> 42:16.757
Well, Eleanor, if it was you,
did you say Theo?

42:16.828 --> 42:20.195
- Theo, if it was you, did you-- - Look,
I don't need anyone to tell me I'm cold.

42:20.265 --> 42:25.225
Let's blame it on the old plumbing
then, huh? What else could it be?

42:25.303 --> 42:28.830
Well, if you don't need me anymore,
I guess that's it.

42:28.907 --> 42:31.967
- My job is done. Good night.
- Good night, Luke.

42:32.043 --> 42:34.341
- Yeah, me too.
- Yeah.

42:37.616 --> 42:40.084
- Will you two be all right?
- Yeah.

42:43.455 --> 42:45.719
You really
didn't hear anything?

42:47.292 --> 42:49.226
No.

44:15.447 --> 44:18.245
Eleanor.

44:26.291 --> 44:28.953
Eleanor.

44:31.963 --> 44:34.454
Find us, Eleanor.

44:35.534 --> 44:39.231
Oh, Eleanor.

44:39.304 --> 44:41.738
Find us.

45:45.370 --> 45:47.341
Okay.

46:10.264 --> 46:13.427
These carvings
are really creepy.

46:13.501 --> 46:17.961
All these fat little cherubs
and angels with furry animals.

46:18.039 --> 46:19.973
It's really bizarre,
I think.

46:20.041 --> 46:22.601
I think they're the children
Hugh Crain built the house for.

46:22.677 --> 46:27.273
I don't buy that for a second-- that
Hugh Crain was this lovable old tycoon...

46:27.348 --> 46:29.282
with a soft spot
forkids.

46:29.350 --> 46:31.284
The guy was obviously
running a sweat shop.

46:31.352 --> 46:33.946
Had children working
16 hours a day,

46:34.021 --> 46:36.649
and then he builds
all this crap as propaganda.

46:36.724 --> 46:40.660
It's like those Teletubbies.
Those things freak me out also.

46:40.728 --> 46:43.788
And they sing, so they're actually even
kind of scarier, if you think about it.

46:43.864 --> 46:46.799
Yeah.

46:46.867 --> 46:49.995
How are you comin' along?
- I can't get this one.

46:50.071 --> 46:53.598
- What about you?
- I did all right. But that's another thing.

46:53.674 --> 46:55.938
These tests.
It's like, why do we have to be here?

46:56.010 --> 46:57.944
Why do we have to be
in this weird old house?

46:58.012 --> 47:01.709
I like this house.
I think it's a beautiful house.

47:05.219 --> 47:07.744
Yeah, I guess.

47:07.822 --> 47:10.052
I don't know. I just think
Dr. Marrow's up to something.

47:10.124 --> 47:12.217
I'll tell you another thing.

47:12.293 --> 47:14.454
I'm gonna get
to the bottom of it,

47:14.528 --> 47:16.689
right after I check on Theo,
that is.

47:18.966 --> 47:21.560
See how
my old pal Theo's doing.

47:21.635 --> 47:25.002
- Doing or wearing?
- Yeah, no kidding.

47:25.072 --> 47:27.905
Did you see
what she had on yesterday?

47:27.975 --> 47:33.072
Wow. Yeah, I definitely got
a soft spot for Theo.

47:35.149 --> 47:38.880
Nell, I'm gonna shut this door
and give you a little privacy.

48:21.829 --> 48:25.196
- If there's any one in there, we'll find him.
- You just saw something move?

48:25.266 --> 48:27.200
- I saw something in the fireplace.
- Okay. Just relax.

48:27.268 --> 48:29.202
I did.
I know I did.

48:38.012 --> 48:39.946
You were here alone?

48:40.014 --> 48:43.882
- Mm-hmm. Yeah, Luke had just left.
- I didn't see anything, though.

48:43.951 --> 48:45.885
Luke, can you help me?

49:18.152 --> 49:20.552
-Just ashes.
- Charred wood.

49:21.922 --> 49:24.789
Watch out. Let it go.
Yep.

49:32.166 --> 49:34.100
Hello? Santa?

49:35.736 --> 49:38.364
- Whoa!
-Jesus! God!

49:38.439 --> 49:41.499
- God, are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

49:41.575 --> 49:43.770
What is that?
- A flue.

49:43.844 --> 49:46.176
-A what?
-It's-- It's an old flue!

49:46.247 --> 49:48.647
It opens up the chimney.

49:49.850 --> 49:52.751
God!

49:52.820 --> 49:55.015
Is this what you saw?

49:57.591 --> 50:00.651
No. No,
that's not what I saw.

50:02.530 --> 50:04.862
Mm-mmm,
that is not whatl saw.

50:04.932 --> 50:08.527
God. Hey, are you okay?

50:08.602 --> 50:10.536
- Luke, are you okay?
- What?

50:10.604 --> 50:13.539
No, I'm not okay! Did you not see
that thing? It almost crushed me!

50:13.607 --> 50:17.065
Yeah, I saw it.
Jeez, I was only asking!

50:18.646 --> 50:21.547
That's what it was.
Of course you were scared.

50:21.615 --> 50:24.675
- It scared the hell out of me too.
- No, I know what I saw.

50:24.752 --> 50:26.720
Eleanor,
this is a very confusing house.

50:26.787 --> 50:28.721
You said it your self.
Nothing is what it seems.

50:28.789 --> 50:30.882
Look at me.
I'm not confused.

50:30.958 --> 50:34.985
I saw something, and that wasn't it.
There was something in there.

50:37.798 --> 50:39.891
Hey, you guys
should take a look at this.

50:49.410 --> 50:51.742
"Welcome home, Eleanor"?

50:51.812 --> 50:53.939
Oh, God.
What does that mean?

50:54.014 --> 50:55.948
His face.

50:56.016 --> 50:59.508
It's my name.
Who did this?

50:59.587 --> 51:02.420
Who wrote this?

51:02.489 --> 51:04.548
Is this one of
your sick jokes, Luke?

51:04.625 --> 51:06.855
What? Come on.
Give me a little credit.

51:06.927 --> 51:10.226
I think I have a better sense of humor
than that. Do you really think I wrote that?

51:10.297 --> 51:12.231
You found it. You could have.

51:12.299 --> 51:15.996
Oh, with what? With the 20-foot ladder
that I keep in my back pocket?

51:16.070 --> 51:18.368
M-May be you wrote it, Theo!
You're the artist!

51:18.439 --> 51:20.373
- Maybe this is your great idea of art!
Don't be ridiculous.

51:20.441 --> 51:23.774
I wanna know right now! Who wrote
this? Did you write this, Theo?

51:23.844 --> 51:26.574
No! Of course not!
Maybe it was you!

51:26.647 --> 51:28.911
How dare you accuse me of writing this!

51:28.983 --> 51:31.178
May be you like
being the center of attention!

51:31.252 --> 51:34.881
What are you talking about?
- Let's stop this now. Come on.

51:34.955 --> 51:36.889
Who was it?

51:41.362 --> 51:45.093
Who ever wrote this,
it's cruel.

51:47.968 --> 51:49.902
You don't know me.

52:04.985 --> 52:06.919
I didn't do it.

52:15.429 --> 52:17.693
Eleanor.

52:17.765 --> 52:19.699
Are you all right?

52:25.306 --> 52:27.297
I know you think I did it,
but I didn't.

52:27.374 --> 52:31.037
- Look, people are always--
- No, I'm not making this stuff up.

52:31.111 --> 52:34.979
I mean, I know you all think I'm crazy
or doing this for attention. I'm not.

52:35.049 --> 52:39.543
For what it's worth,
I believe you're a very sensitive woman,

52:39.620 --> 52:43.215
and I believe that people have
taken advantage of you in the past.

52:45.826 --> 52:48.761
Mmm. "Welcome home."

52:48.829 --> 52:51.059
You'll never see it again.
Mr. Dudley's taking care of it.

52:51.131 --> 52:53.691
Come on. There's something
I want you to see.

53:01.075 --> 53:03.976
- Oh, this is beautiful!
Thought you'd like it.

53:04.044 --> 53:07.502
- Well, I wonder what happened to him.

53:07.581 --> 53:12.814
Yeah, yeah.
Oh, violets.

53:12.886 --> 53:15.354
Some body must've died here.

53:17.991 --> 53:20.255
- Well.

53:20.327 --> 53:24.661
You know, all my life
I've been waiting for an adventure,

53:24.732 --> 53:28.395
and I thought
it would never happen to me.

53:28.469 --> 53:31.029
Adventures are for soldiers...

53:31.105 --> 53:33.733
or for the women the bullfighters
fall in love with.

53:34.942 --> 53:36.876
And here I am.

53:37.945 --> 53:39.879
Paintings are calling out to me,

53:41.615 --> 53:46.382
strange noises in the night,
and all it cost was five gallons of gas.

53:52.126 --> 53:55.289
Do you really think that someone's
playing with you, Eleanor?

53:59.032 --> 54:00.966
Yeah, it doesn't matter.

54:01.034 --> 54:03.628
I can be a victim,
or I can be a volunteer.

54:03.704 --> 54:06.639
I'm gonna be a volunteer.
Mm-hmm.

55:39.833 --> 55:44.099
Eleanor. Eleanor!

56:30.384 --> 56:33.478
Eleanor, find us.

57:08.021 --> 57:11.149
- Eleanor.
- Hmm?

57:11.224 --> 57:15.354
Eleanor, the ledger.
The ledger.

57:15.429 --> 57:17.363
What?

57:33.280 --> 57:35.407
It's Crain's study.

57:46.026 --> 57:47.960
"Concord."

57:48.028 --> 57:50.724
Oh, his textile mills.

57:54.201 --> 57:56.692
"Man. Woman. Child. "

57:56.770 --> 57:58.738
Child.

58:04.244 --> 58:06.178
"Twelve years. "

58:17.858 --> 58:19.723
" Eleven years.

58:19.793 --> 58:21.886
Twelve years."

58:26.900 --> 58:29.027
There's so many of them.

58:34.474 --> 58:36.874
"Ten years.

58:36.943 --> 58:38.877
Twelve years."

58:40.914 --> 58:42.973
They died so young.

58:48.188 --> 58:50.122
" Eleven years."

58:50.190 --> 58:53.785
What happened to you?

58:53.894 --> 58:55.885
Theo!
- Okay, okay.

58:55.962 --> 58:58.487
- Theo!
- Yeah, what?

58:58.565 --> 59:00.692
- There's hundreds of them.

59:00.767 --> 59:05.602
- He kept records of every one.
- I was havin' the best night's sleep of my life.

59:05.672 --> 59:08.300
I swear.

59:08.375 --> 59:10.969
The names, the dates
and the ages.

59:11.044 --> 59:13.376
The names--
they're crossed out.

59:13.447 --> 59:17.406
-It's dead children, Theo.
-Can we talk about this in the morning?

59:17.484 --> 59:20.214
- They showed me. They--

59:21.722 --> 59:23.815
Oh, you're never gonna
believe how I found them.

59:25.726 --> 59:27.660
How'd you find them?

59:27.728 --> 59:30.754
The blood led me
to the bookcase.

59:34.968 --> 59:36.902
The blood?

59:36.970 --> 59:39.302
Little footprints
in blood.

59:41.341 --> 59:43.502
Nell, I'm worried
about you.

59:43.577 --> 59:46.637
Theo, the house,
it's trying to tell me something.

59:46.713 --> 59:48.874
No. You know what?

59:48.949 --> 59:52.908
Nell, you just gotta
get some sleep, okay?

59:52.986 --> 59:56.922
You've gotta sleep.
Come on. Go to bed.

01:00:27.053 --> 01:00:28.987
Okay.

01:00:29.055 --> 01:00:30.989
I'm listening.

01:02:32.178 --> 01:02:34.612
Dr. Marrow?

01:02:36.383 --> 01:02:38.317
Dr. Marrow?

01:02:44.624 --> 01:02:47.279
Dr. Marrow?

01:02:47.413 --> 01:02:49.404
Dr. Marrow?

01:03:10.870 --> 01:03:12.804
EleanorVance continues...

01:03:12.872 --> 01:03:15.500
her alienation
of the other subjects.

01:03:15.574 --> 01:03:18.372
It remains unclear
what she saw in the fireplace...

01:03:18.444 --> 01:03:22.608
and whether she truly believes
she did not deface the painting.

01:03:22.681 --> 01:03:25.241
Interview with Vance
in green house yesterday...

01:03:25.317 --> 01:03:28.013
to ascertain the extent
of herself-delusion...

01:03:28.087 --> 01:03:31.579
was inconclusive,
due to subject's...

01:03:31.657 --> 01:03:33.625
emotional instability.

01:03:36.862 --> 01:03:39.092
Well, I think
I know how experiments work.

01:03:39.164 --> 01:03:42.497
Wait a second. Hold on.
Hold on, Theo.

01:03:42.568 --> 01:03:46.265
What about all the noises,
and the fireplace and the painting?

01:03:46.338 --> 01:03:48.829
- I think it's an old academic
"bait and switch," where-- - What?

01:03:48.908 --> 01:03:50.899
where you pretend that
it's a study on insomnia,

01:03:50.976 --> 01:03:53.740
but what he's really interested in
is seeing our reaction...

01:03:53.812 --> 01:03:56.679
- to these phenomenons he's obviously behind.
No.

01:03:56.749 --> 01:03:59.775
It's not Dr. Marrow.

01:03:59.852 --> 01:04:02.082
Oh, Nell, I've been--

01:04:02.154 --> 01:04:04.088
Are you all right?

01:04:04.156 --> 01:04:07.489
God, I've been looking
for you every where.

01:04:07.559 --> 01:04:10.027
- Are you okay?
- Mm-hmm.

01:04:10.095 --> 01:04:12.029
It's not Dr. Marrow.

01:04:12.097 --> 01:04:14.998
Then who? Come on, Nell.
If it's not Dr. Marrow--

01:04:15.067 --> 01:04:17.729
If you don't think this is really
somehow part of the experiment,

01:04:17.803 --> 01:04:19.828
then why would you
stay here another second?

01:04:22.141 --> 01:04:24.405
'Cause home is where
the heart is.

01:04:34.453 --> 01:04:36.387
Oh, my God!

01:04:36.455 --> 01:04:38.685
What is it?
- Oh, no.

01:04:38.757 --> 01:04:41.521
What?

01:04:41.593 --> 01:04:44.187
What, Nell?
Nell!

01:04:51.303 --> 01:04:54.670
If it's not Dr. Marrow,
that's a pretty scary proposition.

01:04:57.142 --> 01:05:00.111
No, I'm not.
No, I'm not.

01:05:00.179 --> 01:05:02.170
I'm not making this up!

01:05:02.247 --> 01:05:05.978
No, I'm not.
I'm not, I know I'm--

01:05:06.051 --> 01:05:08.815
There is something--
There's something in here.

01:05:08.887 --> 01:05:11.685
I can prove it.
I can prove-- I know I can.

01:05:11.757 --> 01:05:13.691
Oh, I know it is.

01:05:56.435 --> 01:05:58.369
Carolyn.

01:06:05.144 --> 01:06:07.669
Carolyn was his second wife.

01:06:14.653 --> 01:06:19.283
Eleanor, the fireplace.

01:07:48.413 --> 01:07:51.314
Where?
Where are you?

01:07:51.383 --> 01:07:55.012
Where are you?
I'm here. I hear you.

01:07:55.087 --> 01:07:58.853
- Where? That's where you are.

01:07:58.924 --> 01:08:01.654
Okay, I'll let you out.
I'll get you out.

01:08:01.727 --> 01:08:04.525
I-I will.
Okay.

01:08:07.332 --> 01:08:10.768
I'm gonna get you out.
I will. I'llgetyouout.

01:08:10.836 --> 01:08:13.771
Don't worry.

01:08:13.839 --> 01:08:15.807
What's that smell?

01:08:24.149 --> 01:08:26.117
- I'm trying. I'm trying.

01:08:44.770 --> 01:08:46.703
He killed them.

01:08:46.772 --> 01:08:50.332
- What?
- He killed them.

01:08:50.408 --> 01:08:54.778
The children from the mills.
It'sjust likeyou said.

01:08:54.845 --> 01:08:58.247
He wanted to fill the house
with the sounds of children.

01:08:58.317 --> 01:09:02.754
He took them from his mills and he brought
them here, but he wouldn't let them go.

01:09:02.821 --> 01:09:04.913
He would never let them go.

01:09:04.990 --> 01:09:08.426
And I found the skulls,
just like Carolyn did.

01:09:08.493 --> 01:09:11.587
- Carolyn? Who's Carolyn?
- Killed who, Eleanor?

01:09:11.662 --> 01:09:14.859
- Calm down, now.
And he had a second wife.

01:09:16.435 --> 01:09:18.368
But he couldn't hide
his secret.

01:09:18.437 --> 01:09:20.371
You can never hide
a secret.

01:09:21.640 --> 01:09:23.573
Carolyn found out
what he'd done.

01:09:23.642 --> 01:09:26.167
And now he wants me.

01:09:26.245 --> 01:09:29.145
Who? Who wants you?
And why?

01:09:29.214 --> 01:09:31.375
- She's delusional.
- But what is happening to her?

01:09:31.450 --> 01:09:33.384
She's in a fugue state.
Let's get her to the sofa.

01:09:33.452 --> 01:09:36.853
- Wanted to... fill the house with children, but...
- Get a blanket.

01:09:36.921 --> 01:09:40.050
- Come on.
- he-he turned into a monster.

01:09:40.125 --> 01:09:42.059
- It's okay, sweetheart. It's okay.
- No.

01:09:42.127 --> 01:09:46.621
Carolyn showed me in the photograph
where she hid 'em.

01:09:46.698 --> 01:09:48.996
And they're all
locked together in there.

01:09:49.067 --> 01:09:51.194
- He won't let them go.
- Eleanor, listen to me.

01:09:51.270 --> 01:09:54.865
Listen to me. Listen to me.
It's not true.

01:09:56.708 --> 01:09:59.142
He's still here.

01:09:59.211 --> 01:10:02.112
Hugh Crain
is still in the house.

01:10:02.180 --> 01:10:04.671
- No.
- Yeah.

01:10:04.750 --> 01:10:08.777
I mean, what if she's right?
What if she's right?

01:10:08.854 --> 01:10:11.186
What are you sayin', Theo?
It doesn't do any good to talk about--

01:10:11.256 --> 01:10:13.281
- Stop. Stop! Stop!
What if she's right?

01:10:13.358 --> 01:10:16.327
Now, listen to me,
all ofyou.

01:10:17.629 --> 01:10:19.790
Let me explain
what's happening.

01:10:19.865 --> 01:10:23.301
You're participating in a study
on group fear and hysteria.

01:10:23.368 --> 01:10:26.360
What? That's why you brought us here?
That's what this is all about?

01:10:26.438 --> 01:10:28.702
You brought us here to scare us?
Is that it?

01:10:28.774 --> 01:10:30.969
Yes.

01:10:31.043 --> 01:10:34.501
You'r ejust waiting for her to have a total
nervous breakdown before you said anything?

01:10:34.579 --> 01:10:36.513
- No!
- What is your problem?

01:10:36.581 --> 01:10:39.573
I gave you the clues. You created
the story as you were meant to.

01:10:39.651 --> 01:10:42.085
- But it's over. I'm pulling the plug.
- Oh, that--

01:10:43.155 --> 01:10:45.089
- None of this is real.
- No, it is real.

01:10:45.157 --> 01:10:47.091
- Eleanor, it's not real.
- No!

01:10:47.159 --> 01:10:49.753
- You have to look at the bones in the fireplace!
- It's not real!

01:10:49.828 --> 01:10:52.353
And then I saw-- I saw his wife,
hanging in the greenhouse!

01:10:52.431 --> 01:10:54.365
- I know I saw it!
- I'm sorry.

01:10:54.433 --> 01:10:57.732
I'm sorry. I'm sorry
I brought you here, all of you.

01:10:57.803 --> 01:11:00.363
The Dudleys will be here in the morning,
and then we can all go home at once.

01:11:00.439 --> 01:11:03.169
- No! I can't believe you're not gonna look.
- Okay, that's enough.

01:11:03.241 --> 01:11:06.699
- I'm taking her upstairs. I thinkyou've done enough.
- I'll help you.

01:11:11.316 --> 01:11:13.250
Because it was a controlled experiment.

01:11:13.318 --> 01:11:15.286
A controlled experiment?

01:11:15.354 --> 01:11:17.413
She's in total shock!
You can't do that!

01:11:17.489 --> 01:11:20.287
- I told you, it wasn't meant to be like this.
- Oh, come on.

01:11:20.359 --> 01:11:23.260
You don't care about us.
You don't care about insomnia.

01:11:23.328 --> 01:11:26.855
You just wanted to scare the hell out of
us so we'd fit into your little test...

01:11:26.932 --> 01:11:30.493
- or model or whatever bullshit you need to understand this!
- Oh, please! Okay!

01:11:30.569 --> 01:11:33.197
- You can't do it!
- Now, listen! You listen.

01:11:33.271 --> 01:11:36.934
I am trying to help people. My field
of study is the science of fear.

01:11:37.008 --> 01:11:41.069
I try to understand why people act the way
they act, why they feel the way they feel--

01:11:47.386 --> 01:11:49.320
You don't feel.

01:11:55.861 --> 01:11:57.795
Where are you going?

01:11:57.863 --> 01:12:00.457
I'm gonna find out
what Eleanor was talking about.

01:12:56.047 --> 01:12:58.015
What am I doing?

01:13:10.862 --> 01:13:12.796
Good night.

01:13:14.398 --> 01:13:17.697
Be right back.
I'll get you some tea.

01:14:56.601 --> 01:14:58.535
Oh, God, it's looking for me.

01:15:08.946 --> 01:15:11.346
Who was holding my hand?

01:15:26.197 --> 01:15:28.859
- No.

01:15:41.178 --> 01:15:43.476
No

01:15:43.547 --> 01:15:44.980
No!

01:15:47.885 --> 01:15:50.752
I will not let you
hurt a child!

01:16:30.194 --> 01:16:33.186
Luke!
David!

01:16:33.264 --> 01:16:35.323
Dr. Marrow!

01:16:36.434 --> 01:16:38.368
Luke!

01:17:16.807 --> 01:17:19.332
Eleanor!

01:17:37.528 --> 01:17:39.587
No!
That's not me!

01:17:50.107 --> 01:17:52.166
No!

01:17:52.243 --> 01:17:55.144
No!

01:17:55.212 --> 01:17:57.146
Who are you?

01:17:57.214 --> 01:17:59.682
Oh, no!

01:18:02.053 --> 01:18:04.351
Why do you want me?

01:18:04.422 --> 01:18:07.858
Who am I?
Who am I?

01:18:07.925 --> 01:18:11.622
Why doyou want me?
Why?

01:18:11.695 --> 01:18:14.721
Oh, God!

01:18:14.799 --> 01:18:19.293
Who am I?
What are you trying to tell me?

01:18:43.160 --> 01:18:46.493
Welcome home, Eleanor.

01:18:48.265 --> 01:18:52.167
Oh, no! No!

01:18:52.236 --> 01:18:55.262
It's not true.
No!

01:18:56.340 --> 01:18:59.832
Eleanor?
- What?

01:18:59.910 --> 01:19:04.074
Eleanor, don't be afraid.

01:19:06.517 --> 01:19:08.451
You can understand me?

01:19:08.519 --> 01:19:11.613
The doors, Eleanor.
Only the doors can hold him.

01:19:13.691 --> 01:19:18.355
Oh, no!
He's coming!

01:19:18.429 --> 01:19:20.920
What?
What's wrong?

01:19:29.140 --> 01:19:31.301
What do you want from me?

01:19:34.178 --> 01:19:36.646
Help us, Eleanor.
Help us.

01:19:36.714 --> 01:19:39.308
What? What are you
trying to tellme?

01:19:39.383 --> 01:19:42.978
What? What do you
want from me?

01:19:43.053 --> 01:19:45.920
What do you
want me to do?

01:19:46.056 --> 01:19:48.718
Nell?

01:19:48.792 --> 01:19:52.455
- Nell!
I'm gonna help you.

01:19:52.530 --> 01:19:56.057
I'm gonna help.
I'm almost there!

01:19:56.133 --> 01:19:58.294
Eleanor.

01:19:58.369 --> 01:20:01.133
- I wanna help you.
- Eleanor.

01:20:01.205 --> 01:20:05.904
Don't move.
Don't move.

01:20:07.811 --> 01:20:09.745
Oh, Nell.

01:20:13.984 --> 01:20:16.578
Just stay there.

01:20:39.376 --> 01:20:43.107
- Hold on, Eleanor.
Watch out! The cable!

01:20:43.180 --> 01:20:45.705
Look out!

01:20:48.085 --> 01:20:50.883
It's not gonna hold your weight there!
It's breaking apart!

01:20:50.955 --> 01:20:54.220
Don't move, now. Don't move.

01:20:54.291 --> 01:20:56.054
Oh, my God.

01:21:00.297 --> 01:21:02.731
No!

01:21:20.951 --> 01:21:24.614
- Oh, shit.

01:21:30.094 --> 01:21:32.028
Eleanor, look at me.

01:21:32.096 --> 01:21:35.930
I need you to climb over
and step back on the platform.

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:39.834
Come on. I want you
to come down with me.

01:21:39.903 --> 01:21:43.600
Climb over and step on the platform.
Can you do that?

01:21:43.674 --> 01:21:46.871
I can't.
The children, they need me.

01:21:46.944 --> 01:21:49.344
I have to join them.

01:21:49.413 --> 01:21:52.780
Please.
Please, trust me.

01:21:52.850 --> 01:21:54.784
Climb off the rail
on to the platform.

01:21:54.852 --> 01:21:57.047
- Come on. Come on.
-Just do it, Nell.

01:21:57.121 --> 01:21:58.918
Please?

01:22:10.801 --> 01:22:13.201
No! No!

01:22:15.873 --> 01:22:18.103
- Hold on!

01:22:29.286 --> 01:22:32.119
- Here.

01:22:32.189 --> 01:22:34.157
- Here.
- Thankyou.

01:22:34.224 --> 01:22:36.249
Thank you.

01:22:49.073 --> 01:22:51.064
Hurry.

01:22:53.243 --> 01:22:56.269
- Come on.
- No. He won't let them go.

01:22:56.347 --> 01:22:58.281
Even now,
he won't let them go.

01:22:58.349 --> 01:23:00.874
- Come on. Come on. We have to go.
- No, he won't--

01:23:00.951 --> 01:23:03.112
- I won't leave you. I won't leave you.
- Okay.

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:18.934
She doesn't look good.

01:23:19.002 --> 01:23:22.301
Hey, I think I'm gonna take her
to see a doctor, right now.

01:23:22.373 --> 01:23:24.307
I think I'm gonna take her
to see a real doctor.

01:23:24.375 --> 01:23:27.173
We'll take her to the hospital
in the morning. The gate's still locked.

01:23:27.244 --> 01:23:29.178
We have to wait
until the Dudleys arrive.

01:23:29.246 --> 01:23:32.010
What? That's
real compassionate.

01:23:32.082 --> 01:23:34.016
Yeah, let's wait
until the morning,

01:23:34.084 --> 01:23:36.143
and then maybe tonight you'll have
a chance to scribble a few more...

01:23:36.220 --> 01:23:38.518
- "Welcome home, Eleanor"s on the wall.
- I didn't write that, okay?

01:23:38.589 --> 01:23:40.784
You'd never write that.
That wouldn't be ethical, would it?

01:23:40.858 --> 01:23:44.350
Will you guys just shut up?
Come on!

01:23:48.132 --> 01:23:51.568
Somebody's gonna have to stay with
her tonight. We can't leave her alone.

01:23:53.937 --> 01:23:56.337
All right,
I'll take the first watch.

01:23:58.075 --> 01:24:00.043
Okay.

01:24:01.812 --> 01:24:04.872
The, uh, environmentis
proving entirely successful...

01:24:04.948 --> 01:24:07.246
in promoting
shared hysteria reactions.

01:24:07.317 --> 01:24:09.547
The group is manifesting--

01:24:09.620 --> 01:24:14.023
manifesting classic
pathologies of trauma and--

01:24:18.195 --> 01:24:20.925
I should have stopped this
when Mary got hurt,

01:24:22.366 --> 01:24:24.596
and definitely
when Eleanor was

01:24:26.970 --> 01:24:28.904
Jesus, I need to
get them out of here.

01:24:57.201 --> 01:24:59.635
What happened?

01:24:59.703 --> 01:25:02.228
- What happened?

01:25:44.427 --> 01:25:46.987
It's nothin'.
It's not real.

01:26:57.300 --> 01:26:59.393
It's Nell!

01:26:59.468 --> 01:27:02.801
- Nell!

01:27:02.872 --> 01:27:04.965
Nell! Nell!

01:27:15.618 --> 01:27:19.748
- Dr. Marrow! Dr. Marrow!
- What's going on?

01:27:19.822 --> 01:27:22.017
I can't get the door!

01:27:22.091 --> 01:27:26.357
Stay away!

01:27:26.429 --> 01:27:29.023
Nell!
Eleanor!

01:27:29.098 --> 01:27:31.032
- Eleanor!
- We're here!

01:27:31.100 --> 01:27:32.897
Eleanor!

01:27:32.969 --> 01:27:34.903
Push!
Come on!

01:27:44.113 --> 01:27:46.343
Oh, my God!

01:27:47.550 --> 01:27:49.677
Nell! Quick!
Come on!

01:27:49.752 --> 01:27:52.346
We gotta gether
out of here.

01:27:54.190 --> 01:27:57.523
Oh, God!

01:27:57.593 --> 01:28:00.721
Hurry up!

01:28:05.434 --> 01:28:07.561
Get out of the way!
- That's it.

01:28:11.307 --> 01:28:13.867
That's it. Come on! Hit it!

01:28:17.346 --> 01:28:20.543
- Come on!
- Come on, Nell! Come on!

01:28:20.616 --> 01:28:23.380
Get up!

01:28:23.452 --> 01:28:26.615
Come on! Pick her up!
We gotta go! Move!

01:28:29.492 --> 01:28:32.017
Move!
Let's go!

01:28:32.094 --> 01:28:36.053
Come on! I'm not staying in this
freak house another second! Come on!

01:28:37.767 --> 01:28:40.998
Get it open! Come on!

01:28:41.070 --> 01:28:44.733
I can't get up there!
- Come on!

01:28:44.807 --> 01:28:46.798
Hurry up!
Come on!

01:28:46.876 --> 01:28:49.401
Oh, God!

01:28:59.155 --> 01:29:02.283
Dr. Marrow.
How did you know the house wanted me?

01:29:02.358 --> 01:29:04.292
- What do you mean?

01:29:04.360 --> 01:29:07.124
Why did you call and tell me
to look for your ad?

01:29:07.196 --> 01:29:09.858
Ad? But--
I didn't call you.

01:29:09.932 --> 01:29:12.332
You told me
to look in the paper.

01:29:13.869 --> 01:29:16.099
Eleanor, the first time I spoke to you
was here at the house.

01:29:24.480 --> 01:29:26.778
- God!
- What do we do?

01:29:26.849 --> 01:29:28.874
We gotta crash the gate.

01:29:32.054 --> 01:29:35.581
We gotta crash the gate.
Nell, I need your car.

01:29:45.167 --> 01:29:47.101
Move!
Get out of the way!

01:29:51.107 --> 01:29:53.667
- Luke!

01:30:00.649 --> 01:30:04.176
- Luke, are you okay? - Get
out! Get out! - Open the door!

01:30:06.622 --> 01:30:09.750
Eleanor!

01:30:09.825 --> 01:30:11.884
Luke!

01:30:13.029 --> 01:30:15.725
- Eleanor!
- Come on! You gotta get out!

01:30:15.798 --> 01:30:17.823
- Please, come back!
Push the door!

01:30:17.900 --> 01:30:19.765
Turn the engine off.

01:30:19.835 --> 01:30:22.099
Push the door! You gotta get out!

01:30:22.171 --> 01:30:25.072
- Turn the engine off!
- Luke, turn off the engine!

01:30:25.141 --> 01:30:29.373
- It won't go!
Luke, you gotta get out!

01:30:29.445 --> 01:30:31.879
Stand back!

01:30:31.947 --> 01:30:33.881
Hurry up! Come on!

01:30:33.949 --> 01:30:36.247
Aah!

01:30:43.392 --> 01:30:45.656
- Grab my arm!
- You okay?

01:30:45.728 --> 01:30:48.390
Are you okay?
Are you hurt? Come on!

01:30:53.602 --> 01:30:56.662
Are you okay?
Oh, myGod.

01:30:56.739 --> 01:30:58.673
Where's Nell?

01:31:02.278 --> 01:31:04.212
- Eleanor?
- Come on. This is crazy.

01:31:04.280 --> 01:31:06.908
- Maybe she doesn't want to be found.
- Nell?

01:31:12.655 --> 01:31:15.886
Eleanor?

01:31:16.959 --> 01:31:19.792
Listen. Listen.

01:31:22.064 --> 01:31:24.055
- Oh, she's in there.

01:31:35.044 --> 01:31:36.978
Nell?

01:31:38.714 --> 01:31:40.648
Eleanor?

01:31:44.120 --> 01:31:46.987
Come on.
Go get her.

01:31:52.595 --> 01:31:54.529
Oh, Nell.

01:31:56.465 --> 01:31:59.093
Hey.

01:31:59.168 --> 01:32:01.932
Come on, sweetheart.
You're gonna have to come with us now.

01:32:02.004 --> 01:32:05.531
- No, I can't do that, Theo.
- Of course you can.

01:32:05.608 --> 01:32:08.805
We-We're gonna go to your apartment,
just you and me.

01:32:08.878 --> 01:32:13.281
We'll sit and we'll listen to the buoy
in the harbor. Can we do that, Nell?

01:32:13.349 --> 01:32:15.874
That sounds
so beautiful, Eleanor.

01:32:15.951 --> 01:32:19.045
Theo is saying anything she can.
You know I don't have an apartment.

01:32:19.121 --> 01:32:21.783
Then we'll go to my loft...
in the city.

01:32:21.857 --> 01:32:24.485
You're gonna love it there, I promise.
Come on, Nell. Please?

01:32:24.560 --> 01:32:26.528
No.

01:32:26.595 --> 01:32:28.529
I'm right where
I'm wanted.

01:32:28.597 --> 01:32:31.498
- I'm home.

01:32:31.567 --> 01:32:34.035
- I'm home.
- Dr. Marrow, please, we don't have time...

01:32:34.103 --> 01:32:37.834
- to baby talk her.

01:32:39.208 --> 01:32:41.142
You see,
this is the room...

01:32:41.210 --> 01:32:43.872
where Carolyn had her baby
before she ran away.

01:32:43.946 --> 01:32:48.076
And the children, they wanted me to see
this so I would know this was my home.

01:32:48.150 --> 01:32:50.675
Oh, my God.

01:32:50.753 --> 01:32:55.019
Yes. See, Carolyn was
my great-great grandmother,

01:32:55.090 --> 01:32:57.615
and the children
are my family.

01:32:57.693 --> 01:32:59.627
This is where I belong.

01:32:59.695 --> 01:33:03.256
I have to stay.
I'm not afraid anymore.

01:33:03.332 --> 01:33:05.425
I have to stay for the children.
They need me.

01:33:06.769 --> 01:33:08.703
No.

01:33:10.406 --> 01:33:12.340
Nell, the children are dead.

01:33:12.408 --> 01:33:14.399
No. Not for him.

01:33:14.476 --> 01:33:17.343
He's still haunting them.
But if I'm here,

01:33:17.413 --> 01:33:20.712
-he can't harm them.

01:33:20.783 --> 01:33:23.081
Nell, please! We have to go!
Just grab her!

01:33:23.152 --> 01:33:25.552
- You have to go now. You can't stay.

01:33:25.621 --> 01:33:28.522
- Come on.
- I'll take you outside. You're not safe here.

01:33:28.591 --> 01:33:30.752
- Hurry! Come on!

01:33:46.508 --> 01:33:48.442
Come on! Hurry!

01:33:58.587 --> 01:34:00.612
- No!

01:34:00.689 --> 01:34:02.919
He's not gonna
let you go!

01:34:06.996 --> 01:34:08.930
It's too late.

01:34:08.998 --> 01:34:11.831
He's not gonna letyou go.

01:34:11.900 --> 01:34:16.166
The hell he's not.
I'm getting us out of here. Come on.

01:34:31.920 --> 01:34:35.651
- Open up!

01:34:38.527 --> 01:34:41.826
- Come on! Open up!
- Come on!

01:34:46.368 --> 01:34:48.131
This is insane!

01:34:54.743 --> 01:34:56.734
There's got to be
another way out.

01:34:56.812 --> 01:34:59.508
Oh,Jesus!
Oh, God, he's got glass in his hand.

01:34:59.581 --> 01:35:01.481
- Here, wait.
- Get it out.

01:35:01.550 --> 01:35:03.711
-Just pull it.Just pull it.
- Oh,Jesus.

01:35:03.786 --> 01:35:06.653
-Just pull.
- Okay.

01:35:06.722 --> 01:35:08.383
Wrap it up.

01:35:08.457 --> 01:35:13.224
You bastard!
Son ofa bitch!

01:35:13.295 --> 01:35:15.820
Goddamnyou!

01:35:15.898 --> 01:35:17.832
Luke, don't!

01:35:17.900 --> 01:35:21.267
- What?
- Don't!

01:35:26.375 --> 01:35:28.309
I'm gonna burn the house down.

01:35:28.377 --> 01:35:31.005
- Come on! Let's burn it down right now!

01:35:37.653 --> 01:35:39.553
Oh, my God!
Luke!

01:35:40.989 --> 01:35:43.617
- Get off!
Luke, get off!

01:35:57.106 --> 01:35:59.472
Oh, my God!
Luke, get out now! Luke!

01:36:08.550 --> 01:36:10.643
- Oh, no!

01:36:30.339 --> 01:36:33.638
We can't get out.
Why won't he let us leave?

01:36:33.709 --> 01:36:36.610
- What do we do, Eleanor?
- He played hide-and-seek with them.

01:36:36.678 --> 01:36:39.203
That's why he built the house.
You have to hide.

01:36:39.281 --> 01:36:43.274
Hide? What does he think
this is, a game?

01:36:43.352 --> 01:36:46.378
- What's going to happen?
- Why does he want us?

01:36:46.455 --> 01:36:48.787
- No! Watch out!

01:36:53.862 --> 01:36:55.887
Oh,Jesus.

01:36:57.533 --> 01:37:01.025
- You're not gonna hurt them!

01:37:01.103 --> 01:37:03.401
Getaway!

01:37:08.210 --> 01:37:09.802
Go, Theo!

01:37:12.247 --> 01:37:14.977
- Go!
- Follow us! Follow us!

01:37:23.792 --> 01:37:25.726
Theo!

01:37:25.794 --> 01:37:28.319
Theo!

01:38:18.413 --> 01:38:21.007
Hugh Crain!

01:39:04.459 --> 01:39:06.393
Hugh Crain!

01:39:43.332 --> 01:39:45.800
The doors, Eleanor.

01:39:45.867 --> 01:39:47.858
Bring him to the doors.

01:39:53.442 --> 01:39:58.311
- The doors, Eleanor. The doors.
- Hugh Crain!

01:40:54.140 --> 01:40:56.973
Nell! Nell!
What happened?

01:40:58.578 --> 01:41:00.842
- Where wereyou?
- Eleanor, are you all right?

01:41:03.282 --> 01:41:05.512
No!

01:41:05.585 --> 01:41:07.712
You leave them alone!

01:41:07.787 --> 01:41:10.847
I'm not afraid anymore.
I'm not afraid ofyou.

01:41:10.923 --> 01:41:15.519
- The children need me, and I'm gonna set them free!

01:41:17.230 --> 01:41:20.165
Even in death, you still
wouldn't let them go!

01:41:22.802 --> 01:41:25.327
Eleanor, move away. Move away!

01:41:28.708 --> 01:41:31.108
- I'm gonna stop you now.
Don't!

01:41:45.992 --> 01:41:49.120
Don't do it, Eleanor!
He's gonna kill you!

01:41:52.765 --> 01:41:55.290
It's not about them.
It's about family.

01:41:55.368 --> 01:41:57.598
It's always been about family!

01:42:00.673 --> 01:42:04.006
It's about Carolyn...
and the children from the mills.

01:42:04.076 --> 01:42:07.807
If you could hear their voices
It's family.

01:42:07.880 --> 01:42:11.407
Well, I'm family, Grandpa,
and I've come home.

01:42:11.484 --> 01:42:16.012
No, you're not!

01:42:16.088 --> 01:42:19.080
Now, it's just you and me, Hugh Crain.

01:42:22.762 --> 01:42:25.629
Purgatory's over.
You go to hell!

01:42:25.698 --> 01:42:27.723
Stay with us, Nell!

01:42:33.205 --> 01:42:35.469
No!

01:43:06.672 --> 01:43:10.574
No!

01:43:20.152 --> 01:43:23.451
Thankyou, Eleanor.

01:43:23.522 --> 01:43:25.456
Thankyou, Eleanor.

01:44:21.514 --> 01:44:23.448
Oh, Nell.

01:45:31.784 --> 01:45:33.718
Jesus.

01:45:48.367 --> 01:45:50.301
City people.

01:45:55.875 --> 01:45:59.538
Did you find out what
you wanted to know, Doctor?
