WEBVTT

00:01.542 --> 00:03.583
Announcer: PREVIOUSLY ON
DAWSON'S CREEK...

00:03.583 --> 00:05.250
JOEY AND I HAVE BEEN
FRIENDS FOREVER.

00:05.250 --> 00:07.375
DAWSON, SHE IS
HEAD-IN-THE-CLOUDS
IN LOVE WITH YOU.

00:07.375 --> 00:09.291
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

00:09.291 --> 00:12.000
AS FAR AS I CAN TELL,
THERE ARE ONLY 2 WAYS
TO MAKE MY LIFE BETTER.

00:12.000 --> 00:13.583
A SCHOLARSHIP IS
PRETTY MUCH MY ONLY WAY
OUT OF CAPESIDE.

00:13.583 --> 00:16.125
I THINK IT'D BE A SHAME
TO LET A GREAT FRIENDSHIP
GO TO WASTE.

00:16.125 --> 00:18.500
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?
DO YOU THINK

00:18.500 --> 00:21.959
IN ANY CONCEIVABLE WAY
THAT WE COULD
STILL BE FRIENDS?

00:21.959 --> 00:23.417
YOU KNOW, JO, ALL
THINGS CONSIDERED,

00:23.417 --> 00:25.750
I REALLY WISH
I WAS TAKING YOU
WITH ME TODAY.

00:25.750 --> 00:28.458
ALL THINGS
CONSIDERED, I...

00:28.458 --> 00:30.125
I KIND OF WISH
YOU WERE, TOO.

00:35.875 --> 00:38.041
EW. WHAT
ARE YOU WATCHING?

00:38.041 --> 00:39.208
A SPECIAL I TAPED

00:39.208 --> 00:41.875
ON ENTOMOLOGICAL
SEXUAL BEHAVIOR.

00:41.875 --> 00:45.792
IT'S A LITTLE
VISUAL AID FOR MY
BIOLOGY TERM PAPER.

00:45.792 --> 00:47.083
FOR OTHERS,
IT IS ADVANTAGEOUS

00:47.083 --> 00:49.166
ONLY FOR THE OFFSPRING,

00:49.166 --> 00:51.875
WHO WILL ULTIMATELY BENEFIT
FROM SELECTIVE PATERNITY.

00:51.875 --> 00:54.125
WELL, HOW DOES
SHE KNOW WHICH ONE
SHE'S ATTRACTED TO?

00:54.125 --> 00:55.458
THEY ALL
LOOK THE SAME.

00:55.458 --> 00:56.959
INSTINCT.

00:56.959 --> 00:58.166
UNLIKE PEOPLE.

00:58.166 --> 01:00.208
YOU MEAN PEOPLE
DON'T FIND MATES
BY INSTINCT?

01:00.208 --> 01:03.417
MEANING THAT PEOPLE
GO BY WHATEVER SUPERMODEL

01:03.417 --> 01:06.834
THE MEDIA DECIDES
TO BE THIS MONTH'S
PERFECT HUMAN SPECIMEN.

01:06.834 --> 01:08.542
MMM...I BEG TO DIFFER.
I DON'T NEED

01:08.542 --> 01:10.333
ENTERTAINMENT TONIGHT
TO TELL ME DREW
BARRYMORE IS HOT.

01:10.333 --> 01:12.625
20th-CENTURY MEN
ARE CONDITIONED
TO WORSHIP WOMEN

01:12.625 --> 01:15.000
WHO LOOK LIKE NUTRITIONALLY
DEPRIVED HEROIN ADDICTS.

01:15.000 --> 01:16.417
IN THE RENAISSANCE,
THEY LIKED WOMEN
WHO WERE HEFTY,

01:16.417 --> 01:18.333
AND IN SOME CULTURES,
THEY LIKE WOMEN WHO HAVE

01:18.333 --> 01:21.542
BONES THROUGH THEIR NOSES
AND PLATES IN THEIR MOUTHS.

01:21.542 --> 01:23.083
IT'S JUST...THE WAY
IT GOES, DAWSON.

01:23.083 --> 01:24.750
MMM...YOU'RE REACHING.

01:26.250 --> 01:28.333
YOU KNOW, MAYBE
THERE IS SOME TRUTH

01:28.333 --> 01:30.083
TO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING,
BUT YOU CAN'T TELL ME

01:30.083 --> 01:31.708
THAT PURE ANIMAL INSTINCT

01:31.708 --> 01:32.792
DOESN'T HAVE
SOMETHING TO DO

01:32.792 --> 01:36.291
WITH WHAT KIND OF GUY
YOU'RE ATTRACTED TO.

01:36.291 --> 01:37.625
AM I RIGHT?

01:43.000 --> 01:45.667
I HAVEN'T
THE SLIGHTEST IDEA,
DAWSON.

02:51.625 --> 02:53.959
Pacey: SO YOUR MOM'S JUDGING
FOR THE WINDJAMMER DAYS?

02:53.959 --> 02:57.333
Dawson: YEAH, THEY'RE
GONNA LET ME COVER IT
FOR THE STATION.

02:57.333 --> 02:58.500
Jen: WELL, SO WHAT ARE
THESE WINDJAMMER DAYS?

02:58.500 --> 03:02.041
IT'S THIS YEARLY EVENT
THE YACHT CLUB HOLDS...

03:02.041 --> 03:03.333
A LITTLE PAGEANT.

03:03.333 --> 03:05.417
THEY TRY AND
REEL IN THE LAST
REMAINING TOURISTS

03:05.417 --> 03:07.708
BEFORE THE TOWN
REALLY SHUTS DOWN
FOR THE SEASON.

03:07.708 --> 03:09.250
IT'S A BLUE-BLOODED
TRADITION WHICH

03:09.250 --> 03:10.750
CELEBRATES
THE GRAND ACHIEVEMENT

03:10.750 --> 03:13.250
OF BEING BORN RICH,
THE CULMINATION
OF WHICH IS THIS

03:13.250 --> 03:15.166
ASININE
FORMAL DINNER HELD
AT THE YACHT CLUB

03:15.166 --> 03:18.083
WHERE SOME YOUNG
NUBILE WHOSE DADDY
OWNS THE BANK

03:18.083 --> 03:19.792
IS CROWNED
MISS WINDJAMMER.

03:19.792 --> 03:22.041
IT'S THE MOST
ARCHAIC DISPLAY
OF AGEISM, RACISM,

03:22.041 --> 03:23.250
AND SEXISM
KNOWN TO MAN.

03:23.250 --> 03:26.250
DO THEY HAVE
A SWIMSUIT COMPETITION?

03:26.250 --> 03:27.500
Dawson:
I DON'T THINK SO.

03:27.500 --> 03:28.917
MAYBE I COULD BE
ONE OF THOSE GUYS

03:28.917 --> 03:30.000
WHO WARMS UP THE GIRLS
BEFORE THEY GO ON STAGE.

03:30.000 --> 03:32.417
IT'S NOT A PORNO,
PACEY.

03:32.417 --> 03:34.166
YOU KNOW...MY MOTHER

03:34.166 --> 03:37.083
USED TO ENTER ME
IN THESE DISGUSTING
"LITTLE MISS" PAGEANTS

03:37.083 --> 03:38.375
BEFORE I WAS OLD ENOUGH
TO PROTEST.

03:38.375 --> 03:40.834
LET ME GUESS.
YOU TWIRLED THE BATON.

03:40.834 --> 03:43.041
MEANING?

03:43.041 --> 03:45.333
NOTHING.
YOU SHOULD ENTER.

03:45.333 --> 03:47.000
YEAH.

03:47.000 --> 03:48.542
NO, SERIOUSLY.
YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL.

03:48.542 --> 03:49.959
I MEAN, NOBODY CAN
DISPUTE THAT.

03:53.542 --> 03:54.917
I CAN TOTALLY
PICTURE YOU

03:54.917 --> 03:56.417
STROLLING PAST
THE JUDGES, FLASHING

03:56.417 --> 03:58.083
THAT MILLION-DOLLAR SMILE OF
YOURS.

03:58.083 --> 04:00.875
WELL, I'M AFRAID THAT
MY BATON-TWIRLING DAYS
ARE OVER.

04:00.875 --> 04:03.291
FIRST PRIZE IS $5,000
AND A TRIP TO NEW YORK.

04:03.291 --> 04:05.750
WHY DON'T YOU ENTER,
DAWSON?

04:05.750 --> 04:07.708
I'M SURE YOU
HAVE SOME INSPIRED IDEAS

04:07.708 --> 04:08.834
ON HOW TO ACHIEVE
WORLD PEACE.

04:08.834 --> 04:10.333
THE WORLD PEACE
IS EASY.

04:10.333 --> 04:13.333
IT'S THE TAP DANCING
PUMPS I THINK I'D
HAVE TROUBLE WITH.

04:13.333 --> 04:14.750
IT'S A SKILL.

04:14.750 --> 04:16.541
HMM.

04:16.541 --> 04:19.791
BACKHANDED INSULTS
DISGUISED AS COMPLIMENTS.

04:19.791 --> 04:21.875
IT'S REALLY
A NOVEL APPROACH

04:21.875 --> 04:24.417
TO WINNING BACK
A WOMAN'S AFFECTIONS.

04:24.417 --> 04:25.750
I FIGURED I'D
GIVE IT A SHOT.

04:25.750 --> 04:26.959
I'VE TRIED
EVERYTHING ELSE.

04:26.959 --> 04:29.333
WHY DON'T YOU
JUST GET OVER IT,
MAN? SHE HAS.

04:29.333 --> 04:32.125
I THINK I HAVE
GOTTEN OVER IT.
I JUST...

04:32.125 --> 04:33.708
I DON'T KNOW.
WINNING HER BACK

04:33.708 --> 04:36.708
HAS EVOLVED
INTO SOME SORT
OF BIZARRE HOBBY.

04:42.875 --> 04:45.166
SLOW, HUH?

04:45.166 --> 04:47.875
AS THE TOURISTS GO,
SO DO THE TIPS.

04:47.875 --> 04:49.000
THAT BAD?

04:49.000 --> 04:51.041
I'LL PUT IT TO YOU
THIS WAY--

04:51.041 --> 04:53.250
HIGHER EDUCATION FOR ME
WILL BE NO FURTHER AWAY

04:53.250 --> 04:56.000
THAN CAPESIDE COMMUNITY
VOCATIONAL INSTITUTE.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.542
YOU'RE SMART. YOU
CAN GET A SCHOLARSHIP.

04:57.542 --> 04:59.834
YEAH, BUT I CAN'T BANK
ON A FULL ONE.

05:01.625 --> 05:03.500
LOOK, JOEY...

05:03.500 --> 05:05.625
YOU KNOW, NOW THAT
THE PROVERBIAL WEDGE

05:05.625 --> 05:07.792
WE SO FONDLY REFER TO
AS DAWSON LEERY

05:07.792 --> 05:08.583
IS NO LONGER BETWEEN US,

05:08.583 --> 05:11.708
WE COULD ACTUALLY BE FRIENDS.

05:13.041 --> 05:15.166
I KNOW, I KNOW,
IT'S A BIZARRE CONCEPT.

05:15.166 --> 05:17.166
BUT WE MIGHT FIND
THAT WE HAVE
SOMETHING MORE

05:17.166 --> 05:18.708
IN COMMON THAN JUST
THE BOY NEXT DOOR.

05:20.959 --> 05:22.625
OK.

05:22.625 --> 05:23.625
OR NOT.

05:28.667 --> 05:30.708
WE DON'T HAVE TO,
LIKE...

05:30.708 --> 05:31.625
WASH EACH OTHER'S
HAIR OR...

05:31.625 --> 05:33.458
DO EACH OTHER'S
NAILS, DO WE?

05:43.458 --> 05:45.166
PACEY.

05:45.166 --> 05:47.208
I CAN'T FIND MY PEN.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.333
THANKS.

05:50.333 --> 05:52.542
YOU OK?
OH, YEAH.

05:52.542 --> 05:55.166
JUST SPENT
THE ENTIRE MORNING
WITH MY FATHER TELLING ME

05:55.166 --> 05:57.542
WHAT A SCHOLASTICALLY INEPT,
ATHLETICALLY CHALLENGED,

05:57.542 --> 05:59.208
UNDERACHIEVING LOSER
I AM. I'M FINE.

05:59.208 --> 06:00.583
HE SAID THAT?

06:00.583 --> 06:02.166
YEAH. FIRST HE STARTS IN
ON THE FAILING-BIOLOGY THING,

06:02.166 --> 06:06.208
THEN HE GOES STRAIGHT
INTO THE SKIPPING-SCHOOL-
TO-DO-PROVIDENCE THING.

06:06.208 --> 06:07.834
HE FORGOT
THE STEALING-HIS-CAR
THING.

06:07.834 --> 06:11.125
BORROWING, STEALING--
LOOK, IT'S NOT LIKE I
KILLED ANYBODY, ALL RIGHT?

06:11.125 --> 06:12.625
AND IF I HAVE TO HEAR
THE WORDS,

06:12.625 --> 06:14.291
"WHY CAN'T YOU BE MORE
LIKE YOUR BROTHER DOUG?"
ONE MORE TIME,

06:14.291 --> 06:16.750
MY HEAD IS
GOING TO EXPLODE.

06:16.750 --> 06:19.208
WELL, YOU'RE MORE
THAN WELCOME TO CRASH
AT MY HOUSE FOR A FEW.

06:19.208 --> 06:20.708
THANKS, BUT
I WAS THINKING

06:20.708 --> 06:22.208
OF SOMETHING
A LITTLE MORE PERMANENT.

06:22.208 --> 06:24.750
PACEY,
FORGET ABOUT IT.

06:24.750 --> 06:27.000
YOUR FATHER'S NEVER
GONNA LET YOU MOVE
OUT OF HIS HOUSE.

06:27.000 --> 06:28.708
HE TOLD ME AS SOON
AS I WANT TO BECOME
AN EMANCIPATED MINOR,

06:28.708 --> 06:31.458
I SHOULD JUST SHOW HIM
WHERE HE NEEDS TO SIGN.

06:31.458 --> 06:34.166
CHECK THIS OUT.

06:34.166 --> 06:36.041
FIRST AND LAST,
250 A MONTH.

06:36.041 --> 06:39.834
THAT'S MILL STREET.
CAPESIDE'S ONLY
OFFICIAL TENEMENT.

06:39.834 --> 06:41.041
YEAH, WELL, IT BEATS

06:41.041 --> 06:43.125
THE WITTER FAMILY HOUSE
OF HORRORS, DOESN'T IT?

06:43.125 --> 06:44.417
HOW ARE YOU GONNA PAY
FOR THIS...

06:44.417 --> 06:46.125
ROACH-INFESTED
BACHELOR PAD?

06:46.125 --> 06:47.166
YEAH, WELL,
THAT'S THE PROBLEM,
ISN'T IT?

06:47.166 --> 06:49.375
WITH
MY VIDEO STORE WAGE,

06:49.375 --> 06:52.959
I CAN'T EVEN AFFORD
A 2-MAN TENT.

06:52.959 --> 06:54.041
YOU DON'T NEED
AN ASSISTANT

06:54.041 --> 06:56.583
FOR THAT BEAUTY PAGEANT THING,
DO YOU?

06:56.583 --> 06:58.750
I'M NOT EVEN
GETTING PAID.

06:58.750 --> 07:00.542
THE ONLY PERSON MAKING
ANY MONEY OFF THIS

07:00.542 --> 07:02.417
IS LITTLE MISS WINDJAMMER
HERSELF.

07:02.417 --> 07:04.583
MAYBE I'LL JUST TOSS
MY TIARA INTO THE RING.

07:04.583 --> 07:06.500
YOU KNOW,
A $5,000 AWARD...

07:06.500 --> 07:09.500
THAT'D GET ME INTO
ONE OF THOSE EXECUTIVE
BACHELOR PADS DOWNTOWN.

07:09.500 --> 07:10.792
YEAH, EXCEPT I'M AFRAID

07:10.792 --> 07:12.458
YOUR GOD-GIVEN ABILITY
TO RELIEVE YOURSELF
STANDING UP

07:12.458 --> 07:14.625
HAS RENDERED YOU
INELIGIBLE.

07:14.625 --> 07:16.250
YEAH. ONCE AGAIN,

07:16.250 --> 07:19.250
SEXUAL DISCRIMINATION
REARS ITS UGLY HEAD.

07:19.250 --> 07:22.375
WOULDN'T THAT
JUST PISS MY DAD OFF?

07:22.375 --> 07:23.834
Jen: YOU KNOW,
JOEY, YOU'RE ONE

07:23.834 --> 07:25.917
OF THE PRETTIEST GIRLS
IN THE SCHOOL.

07:25.917 --> 07:27.333
I DON'T GET IT.
WHY IS IT

07:27.333 --> 07:28.917
THAT EVERY TIME I GIVE
YOU A COMPLIMENT,

07:28.917 --> 07:30.291
YOU LOOK AT ME LIKE
I'M TRYING TO HIT ON YOU?

07:30.291 --> 07:33.208
I DON'T KNOW. I...

07:33.208 --> 07:35.917
I GUESS
IT'S JUST 'CAUSE
IT MAKES ME FEEL

07:35.917 --> 07:37.625
A LITTLE
UNCOMFORTABLE,
THAT'S ALL.

07:37.625 --> 07:39.250
WHY?

07:39.250 --> 07:42.250
I KNOW
I'M NOT PRETTY.

07:42.250 --> 07:43.750
STOP IT.

07:43.750 --> 07:46.375
YOU KNOW,
IT'S FUNNY, JOEY, BUT...

07:46.375 --> 07:48.500
WHEN I WAS DATING DAWSON,
I WAS PETRIFIED

07:48.500 --> 07:50.250
THAT ANY DAY
HE'D TAKE THE BLINDERS OFF

07:50.250 --> 07:51.792
AND REALIZE
HOW GORGEOUS YOU ARE.

07:51.792 --> 07:53.625
YEAH, RIGHT.

07:53.625 --> 07:56.125
WHEN GUYS LOOK
AT YOU, THEY THINK,
"WOW, WHAT A BABE."

07:56.125 --> 07:57.625
AND WHEN THEY LOOK
AT ME, THEY THINK,

07:57.625 --> 07:59.375
"HMM, GEE,
SHE'S REALLY TALL."

07:59.375 --> 08:01.625
YOU KNOW, I THINK
THAT YOU SHOULD ENTER

08:01.625 --> 08:03.750
THE MISS WINDJAMMER
PAGEANT.

08:03.750 --> 08:05.458
WHAT DRUGS
ARE YOU ON?

08:05.458 --> 08:07.417
COME ON, I'M SERIOUS.
LOOK, I'LL COACH YOU.

08:07.417 --> 08:09.792
YOU CAN EASILY TAKE
THAT EVENING GOWN
COMPETITION,

08:09.792 --> 08:13.208
AND THE SCHOLASTIC--
THE ACADEMIC PART--THAT'D BE
A SLAM-DUNK FOR YOU, JOEY.

08:13.208 --> 08:14.500
LET'S NOT
GO OVERBOARD ON THIS

08:14.500 --> 08:16.667
LET'S-BE-FRIENDS
FEMALE BONDING THING,
OK, JEN?

08:16.667 --> 08:18.583
JOEY, COME ON,
YOU MIGHT ACTUALLY FIND
THAT WE HAVE FUN TOGETHER.

08:18.583 --> 08:20.917
I WOULDN'T
DEGRADE MYSELF.

08:22.166 --> 08:24.000
ONE NIGHT OF YOUR LIFE,
$5,000, JOEY.

08:24.000 --> 08:28.000
I'D SAY THAT'S
A PRETTY RESPECTABLE
COLLEGE NEST EGG,

08:28.000 --> 08:28.750
DON'T YOU THINK?

08:44.166 --> 08:45.333
COME ON, MISS AMERICA.

08:45.333 --> 08:46.875
WHY DO I FEEL LIKE

08:46.875 --> 08:49.000
I'M ABOUT TO SET
THE WOMEN'S MOVEMENT
BACK 20 YEARS?

08:49.000 --> 08:51.166
YEAH, WELL,
IF I WERE YOU,
I'D START PULLING OUT

08:51.166 --> 08:52.667
THOSE IVY LEAGUE
APPLICATIONS.

08:52.667 --> 08:54.667
THE COMPETITION
DOES NOT LOOK
LIKE MUCH.

08:54.667 --> 08:56.333
Pacey: THIS IS
UNCONSTITUTIONAL!

08:56.333 --> 08:57.500
Woman: I ASSURE YOU,
MR. WITTER,

08:57.500 --> 08:59.125
THERE IS NOTHING
IN THE UNITED STATES
CONSTITUTION

08:59.125 --> 09:01.834
THAT SAYS YOU HAVE
THE RIGHT TO ENTER
THIS PAGEANT.

09:01.834 --> 09:04.375
THERE'S NOTHING IN YOUR
RULE BOOK THAT SAYS
I CAN'T, HUH?

09:04.375 --> 09:05.583
THERE MUST BE
SOMETHING, JACK.

09:05.583 --> 09:06.875
TAKE A LOOK.
I'M TELLING YOU--

09:06.875 --> 09:08.667
THIS IS THE MISS
WINDJAMMER PAGEANT.

09:08.667 --> 09:10.667
IF YOU HAVE A TENDENCY
TOWARDS CROSS-DRESSING...

09:10.667 --> 09:12.417
SO WHAT ARE
YOU TWO DOING HERE?

09:12.417 --> 09:14.333
YOU'RE KIDDING ME.
PACEY IS TRYING TO ENTER

09:14.333 --> 09:15.875
THE MISS WINDJAMMER
PAGEANT?

09:15.875 --> 09:17.083
WHY NOT?

09:17.083 --> 09:19.041
LAST YEAR, ASHLEE ELLIOTT
SUCCESSFULLY SUED

09:19.041 --> 09:20.583
TO JOIN THE BOYS'
FOOTBALL TEAM.

09:20.583 --> 09:23.333
I THINK IT'S ONE OF
THE MORE INTREPID THINGS
PACEY'S EVER DONE.

09:23.333 --> 09:24.792
HE'S BLOWING
THE GENDER GAP
WIDE OPEN.

09:24.792 --> 09:26.250
WELL, I GUESS
WE ALL KNOW WHAT'S
IN IT FOR YOU,

09:26.250 --> 09:28.458
DAN RATHER.

09:28.458 --> 09:30.166
TELL ME ABOUT IT.

09:30.166 --> 09:32.875
BEFORE, THIS WAS GOING
TO BE A LITTLE MENTION
ON THE 11:00 NEWS.

09:32.875 --> 09:35.708
NOW, I ACTUALLY
HAVE A SHOT AT
A FEATURE STORY.

09:35.708 --> 09:38.166
SO, I SEE YOU DECIDED
TO ENTER AFTER ALL.

09:38.166 --> 09:40.333
NO. NO,
I'M...JUST HERE
AS A COACH.

09:40.333 --> 09:43.875
WHO ARE YOU COACHING?

09:43.875 --> 09:44.708
LOOK, I'LL
SEE YOU GUYS
LATER, OK?

09:44.708 --> 09:46.667
I'M GONNA
GO WATCH PACEY

09:46.667 --> 09:47.834
MAKE AN ASS
OUT OF HIMSELF.

09:49.333 --> 09:51.375
HA HA! VERY FUNNY!

09:52.417 --> 09:53.917
WHAT,
ARE YOU GUYS...

09:53.917 --> 09:56.542
DOING SOME
KIND OF EXPOSÉ
FOR THE PAPER?

09:56.542 --> 09:58.041
[SIGHS]

09:58.041 --> 09:59.542
GET OUT.

09:59.542 --> 10:00.250
JOEY POTTER ENTERING
A BEAUTY PAGEANT?

10:00.250 --> 10:02.708
THIS IS CLASSIC!

10:02.708 --> 10:03.917
OH, I SEE.

10:03.917 --> 10:05.917
YOU THINK I'M SUCH
A BARKING CAR-CHASER

10:05.917 --> 10:08.083
THAT A "D" STUDENT
WITH A JULIUS CAESAR
HAIRCUT

10:08.083 --> 10:09.375
HAS A BETTER SHOT THAN ME?
THANKS A LOT.

10:09.375 --> 10:11.708
JOEY, NO. IT'S JUST--

10:11.708 --> 10:12.708
I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL
ABOUT THESE THINGS.

10:12.708 --> 10:17.291
IT'S JUST
IT'S SO NOT YOU.

10:17.291 --> 10:18.917
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?

10:18.917 --> 10:20.041
BECAUSE I KNEW
YOU'D MAKE ME FEEL

10:20.041 --> 10:22.542
LIKE
AN EVEN BIGGER IDIOT
THAN I ALREADY AM.

10:22.542 --> 10:23.917
YOU CAN BELIEVE ME,
DAWSON,

10:23.917 --> 10:25.917
NOBODY'S LAUGHING HARDER
ABOUT THIS THAN I AM,

10:25.917 --> 10:28.125
BUT UNFORTUNATELY,
THE OPPORTUNITY
TO WIN $5,000,

10:28.125 --> 10:32.583
NO MATTER HOW SLIM OR
HUMILIATING OR LUDICROUS
MY CHANCES ARE,

10:32.583 --> 10:35.041
THE MONEY HAS
TO TAKE PRECEDENCE
OVER EVERYTHING,

10:35.041 --> 10:36.458
INCLUDING MY PRIDE,
SO...

10:36.458 --> 10:38.000
JOEY, I'M SORRY.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.375
I DIDN'T REALIZE YOU
WERE SERIOUS ABOUT THIS.
I MEAN...

10:40.375 --> 10:41.458
IT--IT KIND OF CAUGHT ME
BY SURPRISE.

10:41.458 --> 10:43.625
YOU GOTTA ADMIT--

10:43.625 --> 10:44.834
YOU KNOW, I'M GLAD

10:44.834 --> 10:47.291
YOU FIND
MY PATHETIC LIFE
SO AMUSING, DAWSON.

10:47.291 --> 10:49.708
JOEY, COME ON.
YOU'RE MY BEST FRIEND.

10:49.708 --> 10:52.125
I'D NEVER LAUGH AT YOU.

10:52.125 --> 10:54.458
YOU JUST DID,
DAWSON.

11:13.125 --> 11:13.959
IT'S HANNAH!

11:18.208 --> 11:21.000
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU!

11:21.000 --> 11:21.792
I'M GONNA GO
SIT DOWN, OK?

11:26.000 --> 11:27.959
WELL, IF IT ISN'T
HANNAH VON WENNING

11:27.959 --> 11:29.750
OF THE BAR HARBOR
VON WENNINGS.

11:29.750 --> 11:32.417
PACEY WITTER.
LET ME GUESS.

11:32.417 --> 11:34.625
YOU'RE HERE
WASHING DISHES

11:34.625 --> 11:36.333
FOR THE REMEDIAL
WORK-STUDY PROGRAM

11:36.333 --> 11:38.542
FOR CAPESIDE'S
UNDERPRIVILEGED
YOUTH--

11:38.542 --> 11:41.041
THAT'S SO COMPASSIONATE
OF YOU, HANNAH.

11:41.041 --> 11:43.083
SO HOW'S
THE SWISS BOARDING SCHOOL?

11:43.083 --> 11:45.208
IT'S IN CONNECTICUT,
YOU MORON.

11:45.208 --> 11:47.667
WAIT.

11:47.667 --> 11:50.333
YOU'RE THE GUY ENTERING THIS
CONTEST?

11:50.333 --> 11:51.917
IT FIGURES.

11:51.917 --> 11:55.375
CLASS CLOWN
OF CAPESIDE HIGH.

11:55.375 --> 11:56.959
YOU KNOW,
I NEVER FIGURED YOU

11:56.959 --> 11:58.542
FOR A PRE-OP
TRANSSEXUAL,

11:58.542 --> 12:00.208
BUT NOW THAT
I THINK ABOUT IT,

12:00.208 --> 12:01.875
EVENING GOWNS...
HIGH HEELS...

12:01.875 --> 12:04.708
I ASSURE YOU
THAT MY SEXUALITY
IS INTACT, OK?

12:04.708 --> 12:06.208
I'M NOT THE ONE
TAKING GROUP SHOWERS

12:06.208 --> 12:08.041
AT AN ALL-GIRLS SCHOOL.

12:08.041 --> 12:09.750
BUT GIVEN
THE OPPORTUNITY, I--

12:09.750 --> 12:11.041
WELCOME, LADIES.

12:11.041 --> 12:12.750
UH, AHEM!

12:12.750 --> 12:14.542
AND GENTLEMAN.

12:14.542 --> 12:16.125
THANK YOU.
[LAUGHTER]

12:16.125 --> 12:18.083
I'D LIKE
TO WELCOME YOU ALL
TO THE ORIENTATION

12:18.083 --> 12:22.125
FOR THE 35th ANNUAL
MISS WINDJAMMER PAGEANT.

12:22.125 --> 12:23.917
THE RULES FOR THE PAGEANT

12:23.917 --> 12:26.583
ARE LISTED CLEARLY
IN YOUR HANDBOOKS...

12:26.583 --> 12:29.041
WHICH WILL BE
COMPLETELY REVISED

12:29.041 --> 12:30.834
NEXT YEAR.

12:30.834 --> 12:32.625
THE MISS WINDJAMMER
PAGEANT OFFERS...

12:32.625 --> 12:36.041
SO, PACEY, WHAT ARE
YOU GONNA DO FOR THE
TALENT COMPETITION,

12:36.041 --> 12:39.291
RECITE THE ALPHABET?
JACK A CAR?

12:39.291 --> 12:40.750
YOU KNOW, LADIES,

12:40.750 --> 12:43.583
I SAY WE VOTE HANNAH
MISS CONGENIALITY.
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

12:43.583 --> 12:45.667
YOU'RE SUCH A BUFFOON.

12:45.667 --> 12:46.625
...TAKE ADVANTAGE OF
ALL IT HAS TO OFFER.

12:46.625 --> 12:50.417
AND MOST IMPORTANTLY,

12:50.417 --> 12:52.250
HAVE FUN.

12:59.583 --> 13:01.959
Jen: JOEY, WALKING
IN HEELS IS PROBABLY
THE HARDEST PART.

13:01.959 --> 13:04.458
DON'T WORRY.
YOU'RE DOING GREAT.

13:21.542 --> 13:23.208
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?

13:23.208 --> 13:25.208
UH, WELL,
I MEAN, POISE AND GRACE

13:25.208 --> 13:26.834
ARE REALLY IMPORTANT
TO THE JUDGES,

13:26.834 --> 13:27.542
AND CONSIDERING
YOUR HEIGHT--

13:27.542 --> 13:30.041
NO, I MEAN...

13:30.041 --> 13:31.375
WHAT'S IN IT FOR YOU?

13:31.375 --> 13:33.667
I MEAN, THE FACT
THAT I'VE BEEN
A FIRST-CLASS BITCH

13:33.667 --> 13:35.125
TO YOU SINCE THE DAY
YOU GOT HERE

13:35.125 --> 13:36.166
IS PRETTY MUCH
PUBLIC KNOWLEDGE.

13:36.166 --> 13:39.000
IN NEW YORK, I DIDN'T
EXACTLY HANG OUT

13:39.000 --> 13:41.166
WITH A LOT
OF OTHER GIRLS, OK?

13:41.166 --> 13:43.917
I MEAN, I'VE
NEVER EVEN HAD CLOSE
GIRLFRIENDS...

13:43.917 --> 13:46.000
AND AS FAR AS I CAN
TELL, NEITHER HAVE YOU.

13:46.000 --> 13:47.875
I DON'T KNOW.
DON'T YOU EVER FEEL

13:47.875 --> 13:50.458
LIKE YOU'RE MISSING OUT
ON SOMETHING?

13:50.458 --> 13:52.291
WELL, WHY DON'T YOU
JUST GO HANG OUT

13:52.291 --> 13:53.125
WITH THE CAPESIDE
PEP SQUAD?

13:53.125 --> 13:55.583
I MEAN...
ASSOCIATING WITH ME

13:55.583 --> 13:57.458
WON'T EXACTLY SEND
YOUR POPULARITY POINTS

13:57.458 --> 13:59.125
SOARING UP THE SOCIAL
RICHTER SCALE.

13:59.125 --> 14:01.166
YEAH, FOR
THE SAME REASON YOU
DON'T, ALL RIGHT?

14:01.166 --> 14:04.125
'CAUSE THEY'RE
A BUNCH OF MENTALLY
ARRESTED AIRHEADS.

14:04.125 --> 14:06.125
YOU KNOW, YOUR
PERCEPTION OF ME
IS ALMOST

14:06.125 --> 14:08.125
AS MISGUIDED
AS YOUR PERCEPTION
OF YOURSELF.

14:08.125 --> 14:09.917
IF YOU WANT TO WIN,
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO WORK

14:09.917 --> 14:12.458
ON THE SELF-ESTEEM ISSUE,
BUT FIRST,

14:12.458 --> 14:13.041
BACK TO THE BASICS.
COME ON.

14:16.792 --> 14:18.834
♪ START SPREADIN'
THE NEWS ♪

14:18.834 --> 14:20.333

ANYTHING ELSE?

14:31.250 --> 14:35.291
WE CAN REVISIT THE TALENT
PROBLEM LATER, BUT...

14:35.291 --> 14:37.208
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO
ABOUT THE EVENING WEAR?

14:37.208 --> 14:38.875
WELL, ACTUALLY,
I COULD GET MY HANDS

14:38.875 --> 14:40.667
ON THIS TASTY LITTLE
RED POLYESTER NUMBER

14:40.667 --> 14:42.208
THAT MY SISTER
WORE AS A BRIDESMAID.

14:42.208 --> 14:45.583
PACEY, IF YOU WANT TO WIN
THIS THING, YOU GOTTA
TAKE IT SERIOUSLY.

14:45.583 --> 14:47.333
IF YOU WIN...

14:47.333 --> 14:48.708
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
COULD BE ALL OVER THIS,

14:48.708 --> 14:51.041
NOT TO MENTION CNN.
I MEAN,

14:51.041 --> 14:52.792
THIS COULD BE
INTERNATIONAL NEWS.

14:52.792 --> 14:55.458
BY BRAVING
THIS EXPERIMENT,

14:55.458 --> 14:57.834
YOU'VE BECOME
A POLITICAL ACTIVIST,

14:57.834 --> 15:00.917
CHALLENGING
SOCIAL STEREOTYPES.

15:00.917 --> 15:02.375
I KIND OF JUST WANT TO
MAKE SOME EXTRA CASH.

15:03.750 --> 15:04.917
Joey: SO...

15:04.917 --> 15:09.542
WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH YOU TWO?

15:09.542 --> 15:10.500
UH, WHO,

15:10.500 --> 15:13.708
ME--ME AND DAWSON?

15:13.708 --> 15:15.959
UH-HUH.

15:15.959 --> 15:17.792
WE'RE JUST FIGURING
THINGS OUT, YOU KNOW.

15:17.792 --> 15:20.083
IT WAS A LITTLE ROUGH
FOR A WHILE, BUT...

15:20.083 --> 15:21.417
WE'VE GOT TIME.

15:21.417 --> 15:24.500
I MEAN, IT'S NOT LIKE
HE'S GOING ANYWHERE, SO...

15:24.500 --> 15:25.708
NO, I GUESS NOT.

15:25.708 --> 15:28.875
SO...SO WHAT ABOUT
YOU AND DAWSON?

15:28.875 --> 15:31.333
WHAT ABOUT US?

15:31.333 --> 15:33.583
OH...YOU KNOW,
I WAS JUST WONDERING,
'CAUSE...

15:33.583 --> 15:37.000
YOU KNOW, NOW THAT
HE'S AVAILABLE
AND EVERYTHING, I WAS--

15:37.000 --> 15:39.500
JEN, DAWSON WILL ALWAYS SEE ME
AS,
YOU KNOW,

15:39.500 --> 15:41.250
THE GAWKY LITTLE
GIRL DOWN THE CREEK

15:41.250 --> 15:43.166
WITH THE BAND-AIDS
ON HER KNEES

15:43.166 --> 15:45.458
AND THE ONE BRAID
FALLING OUT.

15:45.458 --> 15:46.917
I DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE THAT'S...

15:46.917 --> 15:48.542
JUST HOW IT'S
MEANT TO BE. MAYBE...

15:48.542 --> 15:51.166
IT'S JUST HOW
WE SEE EACH OTHER.

15:51.166 --> 15:52.792
WELL...

15:52.792 --> 15:54.291
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY.

15:54.291 --> 15:56.208
PLENTY OF FISH
IN THE SEA, RIGHT?

15:57.500 --> 16:00.291
YEAH.

16:01.667 --> 16:03.750
HAVE YOU TALKED
TO JOEY LATELY?

16:03.750 --> 16:05.125
UH, NO, ACTUALLY,

16:05.125 --> 16:06.250
NOT SINCE OUR TORRID NIGHT
OF NAKED FACE-SUCKING.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.083
WHAT? I'M KIDDING.
WHY?

16:11.375 --> 16:13.250
I DON'T KNOW.
I MEAN...

16:13.250 --> 16:14.625
SHE SAYS
WE'RE COOL, BUT...

16:14.625 --> 16:15.792
SHE'S BEEN
AVOIDING ME.

16:15.792 --> 16:17.959
AND?

16:17.959 --> 16:20.333
AND I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO.
I MEAN...

16:20.333 --> 16:21.834
I MISS HER WHEN
SHE'S NOT AROUND.

16:21.834 --> 16:24.583
AH. AT LAST.

16:24.583 --> 16:26.000
THE MOMENT OF TRUTH.

16:26.000 --> 16:28.583
WELL, THANK GOD,
DAWSON. MAYBE WE
CAN ALL GO HOME NOW.

16:28.583 --> 16:30.834
PACEY, I KNOW
YOU'RE OBSESSED

16:30.834 --> 16:33.125
WITH THIS LITTLE
THEORY OF YOURS,
BUT THE TRUTH IS...

16:33.125 --> 16:34.750
I'VE NEVER
THOUGHT OF JOEY

16:34.750 --> 16:37.208
IN A ROMANTIC
CONTEXT.

16:37.208 --> 16:39.166
I MEAN, I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT OF
HER
AS LIKE A...

16:39.166 --> 16:40.417
SISTER.

16:40.417 --> 16:43.625
I JUST DON'T
THINK I COULD EVER
GET PAST THAT.

16:43.625 --> 16:46.166
IF JOEY AND I GOT
TOGETHER, IT'D BE...

16:46.166 --> 16:48.125
IT'D JUST BE
A LITTLE INCESTUOUS.

16:48.125 --> 16:49.750
SO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING
IS YOU DON'T WANT HER,

16:49.750 --> 16:51.291
BUT YOU DON'T WANT
ANYBODY ELSE TO
HAVE HER EITHER?

16:53.917 --> 16:55.166
Dawson: PLEASE TELL US
SOMETHING ABOUT YOURSELF.

16:55.166 --> 16:57.208
Contestant: I'D LIKE
TO STUDY EARLY EDUCATION

16:57.208 --> 17:00.333
OR HELP WITH CHILDREN
WITH SPECIAL NEEDS.

17:00.333 --> 17:04.834
THAT MEANS,
LIKE, WHEN THEY'RE
CRIPPLED OR RETARDED

17:04.834 --> 17:07.625
OR SOMETHING.

17:07.625 --> 17:11.165
OR MAYBE I'LL BECOME
AN ACTRESS OR A MODEL,

17:11.165 --> 17:12.875
BECAUSE A LOT OF
PEOPLE KEEP TELLING ME

17:12.875 --> 17:14.333
I'M PRETTY ENOUGH.

17:14.333 --> 17:15.708
OK.

17:15.708 --> 17:16.959
AFTER COMPLETING
MY YEAR

17:16.959 --> 17:18.500
WITH "UP WITH PEOPLE"
SINGERS...

17:18.500 --> 17:19.834
WAIT, DAWSON'S DOING
THE INTERVIEWS?

17:19.834 --> 17:23.583
OH, DON'T WORRY.
IT'S JUST
A PRE-INTERVIEW, OK?

17:23.583 --> 17:26.375
THEY'RE HAVING HIM
PUT EVERYBODY ON
TAPE FOR THE JUDGES.

17:26.375 --> 17:27.750
DON'T WORRY, OK?

17:27.750 --> 17:29.875
THE REAL STUFF
IS LIVE ON STAGE
DURING THE PAGEANT.

17:29.875 --> 17:32.208
PLEASE TELL US YOUR NAME

17:32.208 --> 17:33.708
AND SOMETHING
ABOUT YOURSELF.

17:33.708 --> 17:36.000
I'M ROBERTA CRUMP.

17:36.000 --> 17:38.333
I'M A SENIOR
AT CAPESIDE. UM...

17:41.542 --> 17:43.208
HEY.

17:43.208 --> 17:45.959
YOU'RE HERE TO SEE
THE GREAT PACEDINI PULL
A RABBIT OUT OF HIS HAT?

17:45.959 --> 17:47.291
HMM. A MAGIC ACT.

17:47.291 --> 17:49.792
HOW APPROPRIATELY
JUVENILE OF YOU.

17:49.792 --> 17:50.834
YOU KNOW, ALL
THIS SEXUAL TENSION

17:50.834 --> 17:53.125
REALLY CANNOT BE GOOD
FOR YOUR COMPLEXION.

17:53.125 --> 17:55.208
WHAT SAY WE
GO BACKSTAGE,
DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT--

17:55.208 --> 17:56.208
PLEASE. I JUST ATE.

17:56.208 --> 17:57.542
I'VE RECENTLY
BEEN ACCEPTED

17:57.542 --> 17:59.041
TO THE JUILLIARD
SCHOOL OF MUSIC,

17:59.041 --> 18:00.458
BUT I'LL BE DELAYING
MY ENTRANCE FOR A YEAR

18:00.458 --> 18:03.375
UNTIL I'VE COMPLETED A TOUR
WITH THE PEACE CORPS.

18:03.375 --> 18:05.291
YOU ALREADY HAD
YOUR CHANCE, DIDN'T YOU?

18:05.291 --> 18:07.917
YEAH, I ALREADY
TURNED YOU DOWN ONCE
IN THE SIXTH GRADE.

18:07.917 --> 18:10.583
ACTUALLY,
YOU STOOD ME UP.

18:10.583 --> 18:12.041
WHATEVER.

18:12.041 --> 18:14.750
PACEY, LET ME ASK
YOU SOMETHING.

18:14.750 --> 18:17.583
DO YOU REALLY THINK,
IN A MILLION YEARS,

18:17.583 --> 18:19.750

29:25.875 --> 29:29.000
A DRAMATIC INTERPRETATION.

29:29.000 --> 29:31.250
[SCOTTISH ACCENT]
WELL, I'M NOT
WILLIAM WALLACE...

29:31.250 --> 29:32.875
BUT I AM PACEY WITTER.

29:36.792 --> 29:37.750
[SHOUTING]
PACEY WITTER'S
7 FEET TALL!

29:37.750 --> 29:41.708
SO THEY SAY.
SO THEY SAY.

29:41.708 --> 29:44.583
AND THEY SAY THAT
THIS PACEY WITTER
IS A DANGEROUS MAN

29:44.583 --> 29:46.917
WHO SLAUGHTERS
CAPESIDE RESIDENTS
BY THE DOZENS

29:46.917 --> 29:47.583
WITH JOKES
AND BUFFOONERY.

29:47.583 --> 29:49.750
AND IF HE WERE HERE,

29:49.750 --> 29:51.959
HE WOULD DESTROY THOSE
WHO WOULD JUDGE HIM

29:51.959 --> 29:53.375
WITH SPARKS FROM HIS EYES
AND WIT FROM HIS ASS.

29:53.375 --> 29:55.542
[LAUGHTER]

29:55.542 --> 29:56.959
WELL, I AM  PACEY WITTER,

29:56.959 --> 29:58.458
BUT WHO OF YOU

29:58.458 --> 30:00.583
ARE IN THE POSITION
TO JUDGE ME?

30:00.583 --> 30:01.792
IS IT YOU, SIR?

30:01.792 --> 30:03.625
AND WHAT SORT
OF HUMAN BEING

30:03.625 --> 30:05.417
TOLERATES BEING JUDGED?

30:05.417 --> 30:07.291
WELL, JUDGMENT
STOPS TODAY,

30:07.291 --> 30:08.708
BECAUSE THAT
WHICH SCORNS ME

30:08.708 --> 30:09.959
DEEMS TO OWN ME.

30:09.959 --> 30:11.792
AND I AM WILLING TO
TRADE THE TRAPPINGS

30:11.792 --> 30:14.208
OF MY DYSFUNCTIONAL LIFE
FOR ONE CHANCE,

30:14.208 --> 30:15.208
JUST ONE CHANCE

30:15.208 --> 30:18.000
TO STAND IN FRONT OF
MY FELLOW COUNTRYMEN

30:18.000 --> 30:19.458
AND TELL 'EM

30:19.458 --> 30:21.125
THAT YOU MAY TAKE MY LIFE

30:21.125 --> 30:24.834
BUT YOU'LL NEVER
TAKE MY FREEDOM!

30:24.834 --> 30:26.333
THANK YOU AND GOOD NIGHT.

30:26.333 --> 30:27.083
[SCATTERED APPLAUSE]

30:33.250 --> 30:34.166
Hannah: YOU KNOW,
IF SHE DOES WIN,

30:34.166 --> 30:36.166
IT'S ONLY FOR
THE SYMPATHY VOTE,

30:36.166 --> 30:38.500
BECAUSE SHE IS A
TOTAL CHARITY CASE.

30:38.500 --> 30:39.291
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

30:39.291 --> 30:42.250
YOU DON'T KNOW
HER STORY?

30:42.250 --> 30:43.208
OH, MY GOD,
CHECK THIS OUT.

30:43.208 --> 30:46.417
SHE LIVES IN A TRAILER
WITH HER SISTER

30:46.417 --> 30:48.125
WHO JUST HAD
AN ILLEGITIMATE BABY

30:48.125 --> 30:50.000
WITH HER
BLACK BOYFRIEND

30:50.000 --> 30:50.959
[SNICKERING]

30:50.959 --> 30:52.542
WHERE ARE HER PARENTS?

30:52.542 --> 30:54.458
HER MOTHER DIED,

30:54.458 --> 30:56.458
AND HER FATHER'S
IN JAIL FOR
SELLING DRUGS.

30:56.458 --> 30:58.000
BUT YOU CAN
ASK HER YOURSELF.

30:58.000 --> 30:59.166
SHE'LL TELL ANYONE

30:59.166 --> 31:01.208
WHO'LL LISTEN
TO HER PATHETIC
SOB STORY.

31:01.208 --> 31:04.417
I'M SURE
SHE'S ALREADY
TOLD THE JUDGES.

31:07.375 --> 31:09.875
DAWSON, DON'T TRY TO GET
ME TO GO BACK OUT THERE.

31:09.875 --> 31:12.750
I MEAN...GOD, SETTING
MYSELF UP LIKE THIS.
I'M SUCH AN IDIOT!

31:12.750 --> 31:15.417
JO, LISTEN TO ME.
LOOK, YOU WERE PHENOMENAL
OUT THERE TONIGHT.

31:15.417 --> 31:17.333
DON'T LET
THESE INBRED IDIOTS
GET YOU DOWN.

31:17.333 --> 31:19.542
IF YOU LEAVE NOW,
YOU'LL NEVER FORGIVE
YOURSELF.

31:19.542 --> 31:21.667
I DON'T BELONG
HERE, DAWSON.
I MEAN, LOOK AT ME.

31:21.667 --> 31:23.542
HOW COULD I HAVE
STOOPED THIS LOW
FOR MONEY?

31:23.542 --> 31:25.875
I MIGHT AS WELL
JUST SOLD MYSELF
AT A STREET CORNER.

31:25.875 --> 31:27.041
DO YOU REALIZE
YOU COULD WIN THIS THING?

31:27.041 --> 31:29.708
WHY DO YOU THINK
THEY'RE SLAMMING YOU?

31:29.708 --> 31:30.959
THEY'RE TERRIFIED
OF YOU.

31:30.959 --> 31:32.333
THEY KNOW THAT YOU
CAN BEAT THEM.

31:33.917 --> 31:36.041
I DON'T WANT
THEIR MONEY, DAWSON.

31:36.041 --> 31:38.583
I DON'T WANT ANYTHING
FROM THESE PEOPLE.
IT MAKES ME SICK--

31:38.583 --> 31:42.000
I DON'T THINK IT'S ABOUT
THE MONEY ANYMORE.

31:42.000 --> 31:43.917
JOEY, I KNOW
WE'RE NOT SPEAKING
RIGHT NOW, OK?

31:43.917 --> 31:46.125
BUT IF WE WERE,

31:46.125 --> 31:49.041
I WOULD TELL
MY BEST FRIEND...

31:49.041 --> 31:52.208
WHO WAS ALWAYS TOO AFRAID
TO GET UP IN FRONT OF CLASS
FOR SHOW AND TELL,

31:52.208 --> 31:55.917
HOW INCREDIBLY PROUD
I AM OF HER...

31:55.917 --> 31:58.875
AND HOW I THINK
SHE HAS GOT

31:58.875 --> 32:02.458
MORE GUTS AND TALENT
AND STRENGTH OF CHARACTER

32:02.458 --> 32:04.166
THAN ALL THE
HANNAH VON WENNINGS OF
THE WORLD PUT TOGETHER.

32:09.250 --> 32:12.083
FOR YOUR FINAL QUESTION,
MISS POTTER,

32:12.083 --> 32:14.083
PLEASE TELL US
WHAT WORDS OF ADVICE

32:14.083 --> 32:17.708
YOU WOULD BESTOW
UPON TODAY'S YOUTH.

32:22.583 --> 32:24.708
I'D LIKE TO TELL
TODAY'S YOUTH THAT, UH...

32:24.708 --> 32:25.792
NO MATTER WHERE
LIFE TAKES YOU,

32:25.792 --> 32:28.500
BIG CITIES, SMALL TOWNS,

32:28.500 --> 32:31.417
YOU'LL INEVITABLY COME ACROSS
SMALL MINDS.

32:31.417 --> 32:34.250
PEOPLE WHO THINK
THAT THEY'RE BETTER
THAN YOU ARE.

32:34.250 --> 32:37.000
PEOPLE WHO THINK
THAT MATERIAL THINGS

32:37.000 --> 32:38.583
OR BEING PRETTY
OR POPULAR

32:38.583 --> 32:40.750
AUTOMATICALLY MAKES YOU
A WORTHWHILE HUMAN BEING.

32:40.750 --> 32:44.458
I'D LIKE TO TELL TODAY'S
YOUTH THAT NONE OF THESE
THINGS MATTER,

32:44.458 --> 32:46.208
UNLESS YOU HAVE
A STRENGTH OF CHARACTER,

32:46.208 --> 32:48.458
INTEGRITY,
SENSE OF PRIDE.

32:48.458 --> 32:51.250
AND IF YOU'RE LUCKY
ENOUGH TO HAVE ANY
OF THESE THINGS...

32:53.291 --> 32:55.959
...DON'T EVER SELL THEM.

32:55.959 --> 32:57.417
DON'T EVER SELL OUT.

32:57.417 --> 33:00.959
SO WHEN YOU
MEET A PERSON
FOR THE FIRST TIME,

33:00.959 --> 33:04.208
PLEASE DON'T JUDGE THEM
BY THEIR STATION IN LIFE.

33:04.208 --> 33:05.250
BECAUSE WHO KNOWS?

33:08.125 --> 33:09.500
THAT PERSON
JUST MIGHT END UP

33:09.500 --> 33:10.083
BEING YOUR BEST FRIEND.

33:15.458 --> 33:18.458
THANK YOU.

33:18.458 --> 33:20.250
[APPLAUSE]

33:32.625 --> 33:34.708
AND NOW THE EXCITING MOMENT

33:34.708 --> 33:37.041

WAITING FOR.

OK.

34:21.833 --> 34:24.583
THE WINNER
OF THIS YEAR'S

HONEY, YOU WERE TRULY
SPECTACULAR TONIGHT.

35:00.083 --> 35:03.834
YOU KNOW
I VOTED FOR YOU.

35:03.834 --> 35:05.750
YOU SHOULD BE VERY
PROUD OF YOURSELF.

35:05.750 --> 35:09.333
THANKS, MRS. LEERY.

35:09.333 --> 35:12.041
YOU KIDS NEED A RIDE HOME?

35:12.041 --> 35:13.917
UM...NO. WE CAN WALK.

35:13.917 --> 35:16.125
OK. GOOD NIGHT.

35:16.125 --> 35:17.417
GOOD NIGHT, MOM.

35:17.417 --> 35:18.500
GOOD NIGHT, HONEY.

35:18.500 --> 35:19.875
NIGHT.

35:31.959 --> 35:33.166
UH...

35:34.166 --> 35:37.041
FOR THE FIRST TIME
IN MY LIFE, I'M...

35:38.208 --> 35:40.667
YOU'VE LEFT ME
SPEECHLESS.

35:46.625 --> 35:48.166
WHAT'S HAPPENING, JOEY?

35:48.166 --> 35:50.458
YOU REALLY DON'T KNOW?

36:05.000 --> 36:06.583
HERE.

36:06.583 --> 36:07.417
THANKS.

36:16.375 --> 36:18.625
I LOOKED AT YOU
TONIGHT

36:18.625 --> 36:20.291
AND I...

36:21.834 --> 36:24.500
IT WAS LIKE
YOU CAME COMPLETELY
OUT OF YOUR SHELL.

36:24.500 --> 36:27.208
THERE WAS THIS,
LIKE TOTAL...

36:27.208 --> 36:31.125
I DON'T KNOW--
NEWFOUND CONFIDENCE...

36:31.125 --> 36:34.708
THAT JUST SEEMED
TO BURST FROM YOU.

36:35.834 --> 36:37.333
AND I KNOW WHAT
IT MUST HAVE TAKEN

36:37.333 --> 36:40.750
FOR YOU TO GET UP THERE
AND DO THAT TONIGHT.

36:43.000 --> 36:44.959
IT'S LIKE YOU...

36:46.583 --> 36:51.375
IT'S LIKE
YOU TRANSFORMED
INTO THIS BEAUTIFUL...

36:51.375 --> 36:52.708
JOEY.

36:52.708 --> 36:54.750
DAWSON...

36:54.750 --> 36:55.375
[LAUGHS]

36:55.375 --> 36:57.500
GOD...I MEAN...

37:00.041 --> 37:03.542
I'M SITTING HERE
WITH MY BEST FRIEND
IN THE WORLD...

37:03.542 --> 37:05.625
AND MY PALMS
ARE SWEATING.

37:05.625 --> 37:06.834
I CAN'T...

37:09.417 --> 37:11.542
I'VE KNOWN YOU
FOREVER, BUT...

37:15.125 --> 37:18.625
I FEEL LIKE
I'M SEEING YOU FOR
THE FIRST TIME TONIGHT.

37:25.083 --> 37:26.750
JOEY?

37:30.166 --> 37:31.208
WHAT'S WRONG?

37:31.208 --> 37:32.834
I DON'T KNOW, DAWSON,

37:32.834 --> 37:37.208
THERE'S SOMETHING
THAT'S JUST NOT RIGHT
ABOUT THIS.

37:39.333 --> 37:42.375
J-JOEY, I THOUGHT
THIS IS WHAT YOU WANTED.
I MEAN...

37:42.375 --> 37:44.959
IT'S MY OWN STUPID FAULT.

37:44.959 --> 37:46.500
I MEAN, DRESSING UP,
PLAYING THE PRINCESS.

37:48.375 --> 37:51.583
YOU AND I BOTH KNOW
THAT THIS ISN'T ME.

37:51.583 --> 37:53.417
JOEY,
OF COURSE IT IS.

37:53.417 --> 37:56.333
I THOUGHT THIS WAS
WHAT I WANTED.

37:57.542 --> 37:58.750
[SIGHS]

37:58.750 --> 38:00.417
FOR YOU TO SEE ME
AS BEAUTIFUL.

38:02.875 --> 38:05.000
FOR YOU TO LOOK AT ME

38:05.000 --> 38:07.583
THE--THE WAY THAT YOU
LOOK AT JEN.

38:07.583 --> 38:09.583
BUT THE TRUTH IS...

38:09.583 --> 38:12.792
I DON'T WANT THAT
AT ALL, DAWSON.

38:12.792 --> 38:17.291
I WANT YOU TO LOOK AT ME
AND SEE THE PERSON
YOU'VE ALWAYS KNOWN

38:17.291 --> 38:20.542
AND REALIZE THAT
WHAT WE HAVE IS SO
MUCH MORE INCREDIBLE

38:20.542 --> 38:23.000
THAN JUST SOME PASSING
PHYSICAL ATTRACTION,

38:23.000 --> 38:24.125
BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT,
DAWSON?

38:24.125 --> 38:26.125
IT'S JUST LIPSTICK.

38:26.125 --> 38:28.917
AND IT'S JUST...

38:28.917 --> 38:30.875
HAIR SPRAY.

38:32.291 --> 38:34.625
TOMORROW I'M GONNA
WAKE UP

38:34.625 --> 38:36.291
AND I'M GONNA BE JOEY.

38:36.291 --> 38:38.125
JUST JOEY.

38:38.125 --> 38:39.458
YOU KNOW?

38:39.458 --> 38:42.667
THE TOO TALL GIRL
FROM THE WRONG SIDE
OF THE CREEK.

38:42.667 --> 38:44.542
JOEY, THIS IS ALL
NEW TO US, AND WE SHOULD

38:44.542 --> 38:45.625
TALK ABOUT IT, OK?

38:45.625 --> 38:47.083
BECAUSE NO MATTER
WHAT HAPPENS,

38:47.083 --> 38:48.792
WE CAN'T GO BACK
TO THE WAY THINGS WERE.

38:48.792 --> 38:52.500
DAWSON, YOU'VE HAD
A LIFETIME TO PROCESS
YOUR FEELINGS FOR ME,

38:52.500 --> 38:54.625
AND I CAN'T SPEND
THE REST OF MINE

38:54.625 --> 38:57.792
HOPING THAT YOU MIGHT
THROW A GENERAL GLANCE
IN MY DIRECTION

38:57.792 --> 39:00.208
IN BETWEEN YOUR
TORTURED TEEN ROMANCES

39:00.208 --> 39:02.000
WITH WHATEVER JEN LINDLEY
ROLLS INTO YOUR LIFE NEXT.

39:02.000 --> 39:03.500
I CAN'T DO IT.

39:03.500 --> 39:05.583
JOEY, DON'T WALK AWAY
FROM THIS.

39:23.000 --> 39:26.208
I HAVE TO, DAWSON.

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
GOOD EVENING.

39:34.000 --> 39:36.959
COME TO GLOAT?

39:36.959 --> 39:39.708
NO. ACTUALLY,
I JUST HAVE

39:39.708 --> 39:41.375
A LOT OF EXPERIENCE
AT BEING A LOSER.

39:41.375 --> 39:43.041
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT
WANT SOME POINTERS,

39:43.041 --> 39:45.208
SEEING AS THIS IS
YOUR FIRST TIME.

39:45.208 --> 39:47.500
FIRST TIME.

39:47.500 --> 39:50.959
MY BROTHER MATT
IS ON THE NATIONAL
TENNIS CIRCUIT.

39:50.959 --> 39:52.083
CAROLINE'S
A PEDIATRICIAN.

39:52.083 --> 39:56.458
JENNIFER'S A FOREIGN
CORRESPONDENT ON CNN.

39:56.458 --> 40:00.917
ME, I CAN'T EVEN WIN
A STUPID SMALL-TOWN
BEAUTY PAGEANT.

40:00.917 --> 40:03.500
WELL, IT'S NOT LIKE
YOU NEED THE MONEY.

40:03.500 --> 40:05.875
ME, ON THE OTHER HAND,
I'M STUCK LIVING AT HOME,

40:05.875 --> 40:07.667
PROBABLY FOR
THE REST OF MY LIFE,

40:07.667 --> 40:12.041
WITH A BUNCH OF PEOPLE
WHO THINK I'M A BLIGHT
ON MANKIND.

40:12.041 --> 40:14.542
AREN'T WE A COUPLE
OF BLACK SHEEP.

40:18.542 --> 40:20.417
BY THE WAY,
THAT WAS A REALLY

40:20.417 --> 40:24.041
BALLSY THING YOU DID
IN THERE TONIGHT.

40:24.041 --> 40:26.166
THANK YOU.

40:27.417 --> 40:30.417
YEAH. WHAT I WOULDN'T DO
TO GO AWAY TO SCHOOL,

40:30.417 --> 40:32.250
BE SOMEBODY ELSE
FOR A WHILE.

40:32.250 --> 40:36.333
I SPENT A TOTAL
OF 23 DAYS
AT HOME THIS YEAR.

40:36.333 --> 40:38.458
LAST TIME I HAD
A SCHOOL BREAK,

40:38.458 --> 40:41.750
I CAME HOME
TO AN EMPTY HOUSE.

40:41.750 --> 40:46.417
SEEMS, UH,
MY VACATION CREATED
A SCHEDULING CONFLICT

40:46.417 --> 40:48.750
IN MY PARENTS'
SOCIAL CALENDAR.

40:48.750 --> 40:50.375
YOU'RE KIDDING?

40:50.375 --> 40:51.333
ROGER WILL SPEND
MORE YEARS OF HIS LIFE

40:51.333 --> 40:53.250
IN THAT HOUSE
THAN I WILL.

40:53.250 --> 40:55.000
WHICH ONE'S ROGER?

40:55.000 --> 40:57.625
THE DOG.

40:57.625 --> 41:00.291
[BOTH LAUGHING]

41:02.375 --> 41:03.667
ALL RIGHT.

41:09.875 --> 41:11.250
HEY.

41:12.333 --> 41:13.917
HI.

41:15.333 --> 41:17.875
SO HOW'D YOUR DEBUT
AS A NEWSMAN TURN OUT?

41:17.875 --> 41:20.750
UM...TURNS OUT
IT'S GOING TO BE

41:20.750 --> 41:22.667
A BLIP
ON THE 11:00 NEWS
AFTER ALL.

41:28.542 --> 41:32.625
THIS MAY SOUND LIKE
IT'S COMING OUT OF
THE BLUE, UM...

41:32.625 --> 41:37.333
THE TRUTH IS,
I HAVEN'T THOUGHT ABOUT
MUCH ELSE LATELY, DAWSON.

41:39.291 --> 41:43.166
LOOK, I KNOW THAT WE DIDN'T
GIVE OUR RELATIONSHIP
MUCH OF A CHANCE...

41:45.000 --> 41:49.000
OK. I DIDN'T GIVE IT
MUCH OF A CHANCE.

41:49.000 --> 41:50.667
AND YOU'RE RIGHT.
I REALLY DIDN'T GIVE YOU

41:50.667 --> 41:53.000
A GOOD REASON
FOR THE BREAKUP, BUT...

41:53.000 --> 41:56.583
TRUTH IS,
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
IF I HAD A GOOD REASON.

42:00.417 --> 42:03.291
IS IT TOO LATE
FOR ME TO ASK YOU
FOR ANOTHER CHANCE?

42:06.959 --> 42:08.125
YOU'RE KIDDING?

42:09.500 --> 42:12.208
I COULDN'T BE MORE SERIOUS.

42:14.166 --> 42:17.333
GOD, JEN.

42:17.333 --> 42:20.125
WOW, UH...

42:20.750 --> 42:22.625
I GUESS I AM TOO LATE.

42:22.625 --> 42:24.667
IT'S JUST THAT, UM...

42:25.917 --> 42:27.542
YOU KNOW, NOW'S...

42:27.542 --> 42:29.792
REALLY NOT
THE BEST TIME.

42:31.917 --> 42:34.083
I DON'T KNOW.
I GOTTA...

42:36.291 --> 42:40.041
I GOT SOME THINGS
I GOTTA FIGURE OUT
FIRST.

42:40.041 --> 42:40.708
OK.

42:42.708 --> 42:45.166
WELL, YOU KNOW
WHERE I AM.

42:45.834 --> 42:47.875
HOW COULD I EVER FORGET?

42:53.166 --> 42:54.542
GOOD NIGHT, DAWSON.

42:54.542 --> 42:56.291
GOOD NIGHT, JEN.
