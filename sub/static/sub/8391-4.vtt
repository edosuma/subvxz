- MY DAUGHTER,
HADDIE BRAVERMAN,

00:02.380 --> 00:04.132
IS RUNNING
FOR JUNIOR-CLASS PRESIDENT.

00:04.280 --> 00:06.066
- THIS IS WHY I DIDN'T WANT
TO TELL YOU ABOUT THE CAMPAIGN.

00:06.210 --> 00:07.996
- I'M TRYING TO GIVE YOU SOME
CAMPAIGN STRATEGIES THAT I--

00:08.140 --> 00:09.892
- YEAH, AND
I'M SAYING I DON'T CARE

00:10.040 --> 00:11.246
ABOUT YOUR
CAMPAIGN STRATEGIES!

00:11.390 --> 00:12.618
I WANT TO DO IT ON MY OWN.

00:12.770 --> 00:14.214
- MIKE THIS IS SARAH
SHE'S OUR NEW INTERN.

00:14.350 --> 00:15.794
- HI.
- SARAH, THIS IS MIKE.

00:15.940 --> 00:18.591
- IS THAT YOUR BOYFRIEND?
- NO, HE'S JUST A GUY FROM WORK.

00:18.740 --> 00:21.208
- I'VE BEEN, UH, CHOSEN
TO JOIN A TOUR COMPANY.

00:21.360 --> 00:22.907
- THE EUROPEAN TOUR?
- YEAH.

00:23.050 --> 00:24.915
- WHAT ABOUT JABBAR?
- HE SHOULD STAY OUT HERE.

00:25.050 --> 00:27.154
AND HE CAN LIVE WITH MY MOM.

00:27.300 --> 00:30.019
- IT'LL BE FINE.

00:32.960 --> 00:36.088
- OKAY, HONEY, WHY DO
WE WIND UP WITH SO MUCH CRAP?

00:36.240 --> 00:38.162
IT'S ENDLESS.
- THAT'S NOT CRAP.

00:38.310 --> 00:39.447
- WE JUST HAVE TO START
THROWING MORE STUFF OUT.

00:39.590 --> 00:40.989
FOR EVERY ONE THING
THAT COMES INTO THE HOUSE,

00:41.140 --> 00:42.516
SOMETHING ELS|\IIEOHAS TO GO OUT.

00:42.660 --> 00:43.934
- SOUNDS GOOD.
I'M LOOKING AT THIS CALENDAR,

00:44.070 --> 00:45.958
AND NOTHING IS MAKING SENSE.

00:46.110 --> 00:47.839
I CAN'T, LIKE, FIGURE THIS OUT.
I'VE OVERBOOKED THINGS.

00:47.970 --> 00:50.359
IS THERE ANY WAY THAT
YOU CAN TAKE MAX ON TUESDAY

00:50.490 --> 00:51.969
TO DR. PELIKAN AT 4:00?

00:52.120 --> 00:53.667
- HONEY, YOU KNOW HOW HARD IT IS
FOR ME TO TAKE OFF EARLY.

00:53.810 --> 00:55.869
- I KNOW, BUT I HAVE TO MEET
WITH THE O.T., OKAY?

00:56.020 --> 00:58.250
THEY PUT MAX WITH SOMEBODY
COMPLETELY INCOMPETENT,

00:58.400 --> 00:59.674
AND I DON'T WANT HIM
GOING WITH THAT PERSON.

00:59.810 --> 01:01.084
IT'S JUST--
- ALL RIGHT, FINE.

01:01.230 --> 01:02.504
- YEAH? OKAY, PERFECT.
- I CAN TAKE HIM.

01:02.640 --> 01:03.846
BUT IF I HAVE TO LEAVE WORK
EARLY ON TUESDAY,

01:03.990 --> 01:05.434
THEN YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO COVER HADDIE'S SCHOOL NIGHT

01:05.580 --> 01:06.888
ON WEDNESDAY,
SO I CAN WORK LATE.

01:07.030 --> 01:08.167
- OKAY,
BUT WHAT ABOUT YOUR SON?

01:08.300 --> 01:10.097
- HAVE YOUR DAUGHTER
WATCH HIM.

01:10.240 --> 01:12.549
- SHE'S GOT THE ELECTION.
SHE HAS TO FOCUS.

01:12.690 --> 01:13.918
- ALL RIGHT,
LET ME CRACK THIS THING.

01:14.070 --> 01:15.958
IT MAKES NO SENSE.
- LET ME LOOK. LET ME LOOK.

01:16.110 --> 01:17.179
[door closes]
SEE?

01:17.310 --> 01:19.039

01:19.180 --> 01:20.249
DO YOU GUYS

01:20.390 --> 01:21.550

01:27.500 --> 01:29.183

01:32.950 --> 01:34.702
- I JUST THOUGHT WE WERE GONNA
THROW MORE OF THIS STUFF AWAY.

01:34.850 --> 01:35.703
- I NEED NEW INSOLES TOO.

01:35.850 --> 01:37.886
MY SHOES

01:38.020 --> 01:39.908
I LOVE YOU.

02:01.050 --> 02:02.381
- I CAN'T MAKE IT.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

02:02.530 --> 02:04.009
- I'M DOING LAUNDRY.
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

02:04.150 --> 02:05.356
WHERE'S JABBAR?

02:05.500 --> 02:07.047
- OH, UH, HE'S WITH RENEE
AT THE MOVIES.

02:07.190 --> 02:08.771
- AND YOU'RE OKAY WITH THAT?

02:08.920 --> 02:10.911

02:11.060 --> 02:12.129
AND I GET

02:12.270 --> 02:14.158
IT'S KIND OF A WIN-WIN,
DON'T YOU THINK?

02:14.300 --> 02:15.710
- YEAH, YEAH, THAT'S GREAT.

02:15.850 --> 02:17.431
UH, YOU KNOW WHAT?
WHATEVER. HE'S YOUR KID.

02:17.580 --> 02:20.094
- YOU KNOW, THERE
WAS A LOT LESS JUDGMENT

02:20.240 --> 02:21.684
WHEN I DID MY LAUNDRY
AT MOM AND DAD'S.

02:21.830 --> 02:23.058
- HEY, DON'T--DON'T OVERLOAD
THAT, I'M SERIOUS.

02:23.210 --> 02:24.438
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN DON'T--

02:24.590 --> 02:26.171
YOU GOT THE DIESEL TRUCK
OF WASHING MACHINES.

02:26.310 --> 02:27.686
YOU GOT TO TEST THIS THING.

02:27.830 --> 02:29.388
- HOW DO YOU THINK
MOM AND DAD'S WASHER BROKE

02:29.520 --> 02:31.101
IN THE FIRST PLACE?
- 'CAUSE THEY DIDN'T PUSH IT.

02:31.250 --> 02:32.649
YOU GOT TO LEAN
INTO THESE THINGS.

02:32.800 --> 02:34.836
THEY WANT TO MAKE YOU PROUD.
- DON'T OVERLOAD THE WASHER.

02:34.980 --> 02:36.117
IF THAT THING BREAKS,
YOU'RE PAYING FOR IT.

02:36.250 --> 02:37.569

02:37.700 --> 02:39.668
I'M GONNA PUT SHOES IN IT, TOO,

ALL RIGHT?

02:55.100 --> 02:56.749
YOU CAN'T GO ANY TIGHTER?

02:56.900 --> 02:58.856
OW, SORRY.

02:59.000 --> 03:00.615
AWESOME.

03:26.930 --> 03:28.716
- 'CAUSE I DON'T HAVE
A HOBBY, JULES.

03:28.860 --> 03:32.580
- SO YOU'RE PRETENDING
TO HAVE A HOBBY?

03:32.720 --> 03:34.039
- DO YOU WANT TO DO HOBBY DAY?

03:34.170 --> 03:36.138
'CAUSE I JUST SPENT
THREE HOURS LOOKING ONLINE

03:36.280 --> 03:37.759
HOW TO MAKE THIS CRAP WORK.

03:37.900 --> 03:39.037
- NO.
- NO?

03:39.180 --> 03:40.659
- NO.

03:40.800 --> 03:42.074
- "TO CONCLUDE, I THINK
I AM THE BEST CANDIDATE

03:42.220 --> 03:44.495
"FOR JUNIOR-CLASS PRESIDENT,
BECAUSE I WILL LISTEN TO YOU,

03:44.630 --> 03:46.769
"AND I HAVE LOTS OF GOOD IDEAS
FOR COMMUNITY SERVICE,

03:46.910 --> 03:49.595
"LIKE A MAGAZINE DRIVE
AND COLLECTING CANNED FOODS.

03:49.740 --> 03:53.016
"I'M RESPONSIBLE AND COMMITTED,
AND I WILL BE APPROACHABLE.

03:53.160 --> 03:55.128
"MY DOOR IS ALWAYS OPEN,
AND I WILL FIGHT FOR YOU.

03:55.260 --> 03:58.468
SO REMEMBER, VOTE HADDIE"--
STOP TEXTING AND LISTEN TO ME.

03:58.610 --> 04:00.054
"SO REMEMBER,
VOTE HADDIE BRAVERMAN

04:00.200 --> 04:02.646
FOR JUNIOR-CLASS PRESIDENT.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH."

04:02.790 --> 04:05.645
- ARE YOU GONNA DO THAT?
- NO, BUT WHAT DO YOU THINK?

04:05.790 --> 04:07.894
- IT'S, UH...
- YOU DON'T.

04:08.040 --> 04:10.179
YOU'RE NOT INTO IT.
- WELL, I MEAN...

04:10.310 --> 04:12.756
I'M TAKING A NAP,
BUT I DON'T THINK

04:12.900 --> 04:14.276
THAT NECESSARILY MEANS
THAT IT'S BAD.

04:14.420 --> 04:15.830
I'M SORRY.
- RIGHT.

04:15.970 --> 04:17.141
- IT'S NOT--IT'S NOT BAD.
- IT'S NOT GOOD.

04:17.290 --> 04:19.315
- IT JUST SOUNDS LIKE

04:19.460 --> 04:21.803
MY GRANDMOTHER WROTE IT.
- OKAY.

04:21.950 --> 04:24.532
SO WHAT PARTS--WHAT'S
SPECIFICALLY WRONG WITH IT?

04:24.670 --> 04:26.183
I NEED TO HAVE A DOUGHNUT.
I CAN'T DEAL WITH THIS.

04:26.330 --> 04:28.707
- FIRST OF ALL, PIZZA PARTIES?
- WHAT? WE HAVE PIZZA PARTIES.

04:28.850 --> 04:30.294
- HOW OLD ARE WE?
NO.

04:30.440 --> 04:32.260
YOU GOT TO GRAB THEM AND HOOK
THEM, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

04:32.410 --> 04:34.571
YOU GOT TO DO SOMETHING
TO MAKE THEM REMEMBER YOU,

04:34.720 --> 04:36.301
LIKE, YOU KNOW,
WEAR A FUNNY HAT.

04:36.440 --> 04:37.577
- WEAR A FUNNY HAT?

04:37.720 --> 04:39.301
- YOU KNOW,
HAVE THAT BE YOUR THING.

04:39.450 --> 04:40.166
REMEMBER THAT GUY,
SCO'I'I' SUSSMAN?

04:40.310 --> 04:41.618
- YEAH.

04:41.760 --> 04:42.829
- HE PUTS "THE 'STUD'
IN STUDENT COUNCIL?"

04:42.970 --> 04:44.369
- RIGHT, I DON'T THINK
THAT'S FUNNY.

04:44.520 --> 04:45.794
- IT'S AMAZING.
- IT'S NOT STUDEN--

04:45.940 --> 04:47.419
- BECAUSE THE WORD "STUD"
IS IN THE WORD "STUDENT."

04:47.560 --> 04:49.528
- IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.
- WELL...

04:49.660 --> 04:51.389
- YOU PRONOUNCE IT WRONG,
AND THEN THE WHOLE THING

04:51.530 --> 04:52.599
GOES OUT THE WINDOW.

04:52.740 --> 04:54.241
IT'S LAZY,
IS REALLY WHAT IT IS.

04:54.390 --> 04:56.950
- THE POINT IS,
THE GUY GOT ELECTED.

04:57.080 --> 04:59.799
- I SEE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.
OKAY.

04:59.950 --> 05:02.259
- SO...
- WELL, IS THIS THE ANAPHASE?

05:02.400 --> 05:04.322
- UH, IT LOOKS LIKE THE ANA--
- WHAT IS THE ORDER?

05:04.470 --> 05:06.506
- WELL, OKAY,
I THINK THAT GOES THERE.

05:06.650 --> 05:08.220
ALL RIGHT, SO JUST KEEP IT.

05:08.370 --> 05:09.849
YEAH, LET'S PUT IT BACK.
- [chuckles]

05:09.990 --> 05:12.094
- [giggles] YOU GOT IT?
ALL RIGHT, I'LL DO IT.

05:12.240 --> 05:14.208
OKAY, AND...
- THESE NEED TO BE SWITCHED?

05:14.340 --> 05:17.412
- YOU HAVE SOOMHETHING HERE.

05:17.550 --> 05:20.269
- OKAY, SO WHAT--
- YOU'RE SPYING AGAIN.

05:20.420 --> 05:22.240
- I'M NOT SPYING.
- YEAH, YOU ARE.

05:22.390 --> 05:23.652
- NO, I'M JUST LOOKING.

05:23.800 --> 05:26.177
MOM, THE GIRL LIKES HIM,
YOU KNOW?

05:26.320 --> 05:28.140
- YEAH, LIKE...

05:29.770 --> 05:31.419
- THEY'RE DOING
A SCIENCE PROJECT TOGETHER.

05:31.570 --> 05:35.392
- BECAUSE SHE ASKED TO BE
HIS LAB PARTNER.

05:35.540 --> 05:38.361
[clicks tongue] SHE LIKES HIM,
AND HE DOES NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO.

05:38.510 --> 05:40.330
- [sighs]
- I'M GOING IN.

05:40.470 --> 05:43.223
- [gaSPSJ
UH...

05:43.370 --> 05:45.543
- HEY, HOW'S IT GOING?

05:45.690 --> 05:48.784
- UH, GOOD. WE THINK
WE'VE FIGURED OUT MITOSIS, SO...

05:48.930 --> 05:52.582
- WELL, I HOPE
THERE'S A CURE FOR THAT.

05:52.730 --> 05:54.300
DO YOU NEED ANYTHING?

05:54.450 --> 05:58.864
DID--DID YOU WANT SOME LEMONADE
OR, UM, COOKIES OR...?

05:59.010 --> 06:00.898

- WELL, PERHAPS I'LL BRING YOU
A MARTINI AND SOME POT.

06:05.330 --> 06:06.524
I WAS JUST KIDDING.

06:06.670 --> 06:08.945
THAT'S--YOU SHOULD NOT DO DRUGS
OR DRINK.

06:09.090 --> 06:12.150
UH, YOU KNOW,
STAY IN SCHOOL.

06:12.300 --> 06:14.325
DON'T CUT YOUR OWN BANGS--
- WE'RE ALREADY IN SCHOOL.

06:14.470 --> 06:15.710
- THESE ARE JUST A FEW
OF MY MO'I'I'OS.

06:15.850 --> 06:18.785
OKAY, FINE.
I'LL, UH, SEE YOU LATER.

06:21.410 --> 06:22.991

A PAIN IN THE ASS.

06:23.140 --> 06:24.448
I DON'T KNOW...
- IT'S OKAY.

06:24.590 --> 06:26.239
- SHE'S ACTUALLY
KIND OF FUNNY.

06:26.380 --> 06:28.439
- FUNNY?

06:28.590 --> 06:30.899

YOU KNOW, YOU REALIZE YOU STOP
MAKING TIME FOR EACH OTHER,

07:45.810 --> 07:47.289
STOP MAKING TIME
FOR YOURSELVES,

07:47.430 --> 07:49.386
AND YOU THINK YOU'RE
NOT GONNA BE ONE OF THOSE 80%.

- WHEN YOU SAY, "DATE NIGHT,"
I FEEL LIKE THERE'S PRESSURE.

08:32.680 --> 08:34.568
IT'S LIKE WE'RE SCREWED BEFORE
WE EVEN GET OUT OF THE GATE.

08:34.720 --> 08:36.369

16:07.820 --> 16:10.266
WE COULD DO SOME OF THAT.
- YEAH, YOU KNOW...

16:10.410 --> 16:12.685
I DON'T KNOW IF TECHNICALLY
IT COUNTS AS A HOBBY,

16:12.830 --> 16:15.378
BUT IT WOULD BE ONE HELL
OF A PRESENTATION.

16:15.520 --> 16:17.795
- CAN YOU IMAGINE
MRS. BREWSTER'S FACE?

16:17.940 --> 16:20.272
SCANDAL IN THE KINDERGARTEN,
NEWS AT 6:00.

16:22.700 --> 16:26.454
- DADDY, I CAN'T
FIND MY PHINEAS AND FERB.

16:27.740 --> 16:30.288
- [whispering]
SHE'S LIKE A SILENT NINJA.

16:33.850 --> 16:35.886
[knock on door]
- HELLO?

16:36.020 --> 16:37.578
RENEE?

16:47.480 --> 16:48.799
- WHAT DO YOU WANT, CROSBY?

16:48.930 --> 16:50.272
- I'M LOOKING FOR JABBAR.

16:50.420 --> 16:52.308
- MOM TOOK HIM
TO THE PARK ALREADY.

16:52.450 --> 16:54.589
YOU NORMALLY WALK
INTO PEOPLE'S HOUSES UNINVITED?

16:54.730 --> 16:57.426
- UH, YEAH, WHEN
MY SON LIVES IN THEM.

16:57.560 --> 16:59.448
DO YOU NORMALLY DO
YOUR LAUNDRY AT MOMMY'S?

16:59.600 --> 17:02.706
- MY MACHINE IS BROKEN.
WHAT ABOUT IT?

17:02.840 --> 17:03.909
- THAT'S PRETTY LAME.

17:04.050 --> 17:05.358
- WHERE DO
YOU DO YOUR LAUNDRY?

17:05.500 --> 17:07.536
- THAT'S NONE OF YOUR BUS--
YOU KNOW WHAT, DUDE?

17:07.680 --> 17:09.841
NOT THAT I HAVE
TO EXPLAIN MYSELF TO YOU,

17:09.990 --> 17:12.572
BUT THE GIRL LAST NIGHT...

17:12.720 --> 17:15.166
THAT'S MY AUTISTIC
NEPHEW'S BEHAVIORAL AIDE.

17:15.310 --> 17:16.925
THERE'S NOTHING
GOING ON BETWEEN US.

17:17.070 --> 17:18.822
WHEN YOUR MOM CALLED, I WAS
IN THE MIDDLE OF CELEBRATING

17:18.960 --> 17:21.849
FINISHING A BIG ALBUM, AND
I WAS IN NO POSITION TO DRIVE,

17:22.000 --> 17:23.137
SO I CALLED MY BROTHER'S HOUSE.

17:23.280 --> 17:24.929
SHE PICKED UP,
OFFERED TO DRIVE ME.

17:25.070 --> 17:26.310
I SAID, "FINE."

17:26.450 --> 17:28.008
THAT'S ALL THAT HAPPENED.
- OKAY, WHATEVER.

17:28.150 --> 17:29.139
- NO, NO,
NOT "WHATEVER."

17:29.280 --> 17:30.599
I WAS OFF THE CLOCK.

17:30.730 --> 17:32.174
IT WAS YOUR MOM'S DAY
WITH JABBAR YESTERDAY.

17:32.320 --> 17:33.526
AND IF I KNEW
SHE WAS GONNA NEED ME,

17:33.670 --> 17:35.001
I WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN DRINKING.

17:35.150 --> 17:36.526
I WOULDN'T HAVE EVEN BEEN
AT THE PARTY.

17:38.640 --> 17:40.949
- YOU CAN DO
WHATEVER YOU WANT TO DO.

17:41.090 --> 17:42.489
I MEAN, THAT
WOULD BE TOTALLY UNCOOL,

17:42.640 --> 17:44.460
SO I WOULDN'T PUT IT
PAST YOU, BUT GO CRAZY.

17:44.610 --> 17:46.464
- OKAY, YOU KNOW
WHAT I THINK, CROSBY?

17:46.610 --> 17:48.225
IF YOU REALLY
WANT TO BE A FATHER,

17:48.370 --> 17:50.474
YOU'D KNOW YOU'RE NEVER
OFF THE CLOCK.

17:52.930 --> 17:56.411
- YES, THURSDAY NIGHT WE'RE ON.
THAT SOUNDS REALLY GOOD.

17:56.550 --> 17:57.482
OKAY.

17:57.620 --> 17:59.030
ALL RIGHT,
I'LL TALK TO YOU THEN.

17:59.180 --> 18:00.511
BYE.
[phone beeps]

18:00.660 --> 18:01.820
HI, HOW ARE YOU?
- HEY.

18:01.970 --> 18:03.904
I'M JUST LOOKING FOR AMBER.
IS SHE HERE?

18:04.040 --> 18:05.075
- HEY, GUYS.
- HEY.

18:05.220 --> 18:07.688
- OH, HADDIE,
HAVE YOU MET HOLLY?

18:07.840 --> 18:09.216
- NO. HI.

18:09.360 --> 18:11.453
- WE'RE WORKING ON
A PROJECT THING.

18:11.600 --> 18:13.875
- I'M TELLING ALL MY
JUNIOR FRIENDS TO VOTE FOR YOU.

18:14.020 --> 18:15.874
- AW.
- THANKS. COOL.

18:16.020 --> 18:17.362
- SEE YOU.

18:18.820 --> 18:21.505
- SHE SEEMS NICE.
- THAT'S HOLLY.

18:21.650 --> 18:24.027
- THAT'S WEIRD.
- DAY TWO.

18:24.170 --> 18:25.376
AH?
CAN YOU FEEL THE HEAT?

18:25.510 --> 18:27.478
- UH, YEAH.
IT'S PALPABLE.

18:27.620 --> 18:30.680
I'M JUST LOOKING
FOR AMBER FOR...

18:30.830 --> 18:32.718
UM, I REDID MY SPEECH,
AND I WANTED HER TO READ IT.

18:32.870 --> 18:34.098
- OH.

18:34.250 --> 18:35.649
WELL, I'M HERE.
I COULD LOOK AT IT.

18:37.730 --> 18:39.072
- YEAH.

18:39.220 --> 18:40.448
YEAH, PLEASE.
YES.

18:40.600 --> 18:41.669
- YEAH?
- YEAH, THANKS.

18:41.810 --> 18:43.118
- GOOD.
- YEAH, MAYBE YOU'LL BE ABLE

18:43.260 --> 18:44.739
TO GIVE ME
A FRESH PERSPECTIVE.

18:44.880 --> 18:46.279
- LET'S SEE.

18:46.430 --> 18:48.773
- ANOTHER DRAFT.

18:48.920 --> 18:50.603
- [sighs]
HEY.

18:50.750 --> 18:52.604
- HI.
- I'M SORRY I'M SO LATE.

18:52.750 --> 18:54.399
IT'S JUST...
- IT'S OKAY.

18:54.540 --> 18:56.337
- IT WAS A CRAZY DAY.
- DID YOU GET ANYTHING TO EAT?

18:56.480 --> 18:57.788
- YEAH, I HAD
SOME CRAP AT WORK.

18:57.920 --> 19:01.094
GORDON WAS CALLING ME
ALL DAY LONG FROM MENLO PARK.

19:01.240 --> 19:02.229
HE'S AT THIS
INVESTOR CONFERENCE...

19:02.380 --> 19:04.712
- AY.
- ASKING ME HOW I CAN CUT COSTS.

19:04.860 --> 19:06.748
I'M GOING OVER THE COST REPORTS,
AND I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

19:06.900 --> 19:09.107
WHAT TO DO,
AND IT'S NOT PRETTY.

19:09.250 --> 19:11.138
- WHAT CAN I DO TO HELP?

19:11.280 --> 19:13.840
- HEY, LISTEN,
ABOUT THURSDAY...

19:13.980 --> 19:15.379
- UH-HUH?

19:15.530 --> 19:17.316
- I WAS JUST WONDERING
IF YOU'D BE WILLING

19:17.460 --> 19:19.940
TO MOVE IT BY ONE WEEK
TO NEXT THURSDAY.

19:20.080 --> 19:22.184
IT WOULD MAKE THINGS
A LOT EASIER FOR ME.

19:24.470 --> 19:25.630
- SURE.
- I KNOW YOU WANT TO GO OUT.

19:25.780 --> 19:27.224
- THAT'S FINE.
- AND I DO TOO.

19:27.370 --> 19:29.838
- NO, ABSOLUTELY, 100%.
WHATEVER YOU NEED.

19:29.990 --> 19:31.787
- [sighs]

19:31.920 --> 19:33.501
- THIS IS EXACTLY
WHAT SHE SAID WOULD HAPPEN.

19:33.650 --> 19:34.810
THIS IS HOW--
- WHO?

19:34.960 --> 19:36.643
- THIS IS HOW WE
BECOME ONE OF THE 80%.

19:36.790 --> 19:38.018
- WHAT'S GOING ON WITH YOU?
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

19:38.170 --> 19:39.512
WHAT'S 80%?
- SUZE LESSING.

19:39.660 --> 19:40.820
- SUZE LESSING?
- SUZE LESSING TOLD ME TODAY

19:40.970 --> 19:43.484
THAT 80% OF COUPLES
THAT HAVE CHILDREN WITH AUTISM

19:43.630 --> 19:44.824
END UP GETTING DIVORCED

19:44.970 --> 19:46.483
BECAUSE THEY DON'T SPEND
ENOUGH TIME TOGETHER.

19:46.630 --> 19:47.790
- THIS IS
ALL ABOUT SUZE LESSING?

19:47.940 --> 19:49.282
- IT'S NOT
ABOUT SUZE LESSING, OKAY?

19:49.420 --> 19:51.240
HER THERAPIST
TOLD HER THIS STATISTIC.

19:51.390 --> 19:52.903
IT'S A TRUE THING.
- NO. HELLO?

19:53.050 --> 19:54.324
MAYBE THERE'S A REASON
THOSE TWO KOOKS ARE IN THERAPY.

19:54.460 --> 19:57.349
- THEY'RE NOT KOOKS, HONEY.
THEY'RE NOT CONNECTING, OKAY?

19:57.500 --> 19:58.808
- HONEY, WE ARE
NOT PHIL AND SUZE LESSING.

19:58.950 --> 20:01.464
- I'M JUST ASKING
FOR ONE NIGHT.

20:01.610 --> 20:05.330
THAT'S ALL I WAS ASKING FOR
WAS JUST FOR ONE NIGHT.

20:05.480 --> 20:07.573
- OKAY. I SEE THAT THIS
IS IMPORTANT TO YOU,

20:07.720 --> 20:10.029
AND WE'RE GONNA GO OUT
THIS THURSDAY.

20:10.170 --> 20:11.512
OKAY?

20:16.380 --> 20:17.483
- HEY.
WE GOT TO GO.

20:17.630 --> 20:19.200
- I CAN'T FIND MY PHONE.

20:19.350 --> 20:21.693
- OH, NO.
- YES.

20:21.840 --> 20:23.796
- OKAY.
WHAT DO YOU HAVE TODAY?

20:23.940 --> 20:25.623
DO YOU HAVE
YOUR SCIENCE PROJECT?

20:25.770 --> 20:27.044
- YEAH.

20:27.190 --> 20:30.284
- WILL BE WORKING ON IT
WITH YOUR LAB PARTNER?

20:30.430 --> 20:31.351
- WOW. YES.

20:31.500 --> 20:32.660
- AGAIN. WOW.

20:32.810 --> 20:35.461
- SHE IS MY LAB PARTNER,
SO IT MAKES SENSE.

20:35.610 --> 20:37.225
- YOU KNOW,
I THINK SHE LIKES YOU.

20:37.370 --> 20:40.988
- NO, I DOUBT THAT.

20:41.130 --> 20:42.267
- OH, OKAY.

20:42.410 --> 20:45.789
I THINK YOU LIKE HER TOO.

20:45.930 --> 20:47.443
IS IT EMBARRASSING?

20:47.590 --> 20:50.479
- I'M NOT EMBARRASSED.
IT'S JUST--I DON'T--

20:50.620 --> 20:52.133
I MEAN, I GOT AN "A"
IN SCIENCE LAST YEAR,

20:52.280 --> 20:53.827
AND SHE GOT A "D."

20:53.970 --> 20:55.528
SO SHE'S OBVIOUSLY JUST
TRYING TO GET A GOOD GRADE.

20:55.660 --> 20:57.241
- I DON'T THINK SO.

20:57.390 --> 21:00.621
YOU KNOW, GIRLS LIKE IT WHEN
A GUY MAKES THE FIRST MOVE.

21:03.500 --> 21:05.536
- THIS IS
A REALLY WEIRD CONVERSATION.

21:05.670 --> 21:08.321
- I'M SERIOUS, HONEY--
THE WAY SHE TALKS TO YOU,

21:08.470 --> 21:10.700
AND, YOU KNOW,
TOUCHES YOU UNNECESSARILY,

21:10.850 --> 21:13.080
LAUGHS AT ALL YOUR JOKES--
NOT THAT THEY'RE NOT FUNNY.

21:13.230 --> 21:15.403
"WHOO! SCIENCE!
YOU KNOW SO MUCH ABOUT SCIENCE!"

21:15.550 --> 21:17.199
SHE LIKES YOU.

21:17.340 --> 21:19.262
DON'T BE AFRAID
TO ACT ON IT...

21:19.410 --> 21:22.584
IN A, YOU KNOW, REASONABLE WAY.
- THIS IS TOO WEIRD.

21:22.720 --> 21:24.369
THIS IS THE WEIRDEST
CONVERSATION WE'VE EVER HAD.

21:24.520 --> 21:26.442
- HONEY, LOOK AT YOU.
YOU'RE AMAZING.

21:26.590 --> 21:28.000
WHO COULD NOT LOVE YOU?

21:28.140 --> 21:29.311
HUH?
I ASK YOU, WHO?

21:29.460 --> 21:32.315
- AMBER...MAYBE.
- OH.

21:34.430 --> 21:37.456
- [sighs]

21:42.120 --> 21:43.360
- OKAY, HONEY, HIT ME.
- OKAY, SO IT'S EITHER

21:43.500 --> 21:45.843
HARBOR CAFE AT 7:30
OR BASTIDE'S AT 8:00.

21:45.990 --> 21:48.049
- UH, HARBOR CAFE
SOUNDS GOOD.

21:48.200 --> 21:49.360
- HARBOR CAFE?
REALLY?

21:49.510 --> 21:50.954
WELL, BASTIDE GOT 4 1/2 STARS.

21:51.100 --> 21:52.089
- HONEY, JUST YOU PICK.

21:52.240 --> 21:53.548
IF YOU'RE HAPPY,
I'M HAPPY, OKAY?

21:53.690 --> 21:56.067
LOOK, I GOT TO GO OVER
THESE COST REPORTS, OKAY?

21:56.210 --> 21:57.199
I LOVE YOU.
BYE.

21:57.350 --> 21:58.999
[phone beeps]

21:59.140 --> 22:00.277
- BASTIDE.

22:00.420 --> 22:02.240
- WHAT'S UP, BUTTERBEAN?

22:02.390 --> 22:03.698
- YOU ALREADY KNOW
ABOUT THAT?

22:03.830 --> 22:06.037
HOW?
- YEAH, GABY TALKED TO KRISTINA.

22:06.180 --> 22:07.738
- GAB--
- YEAH, GABY, KRISTINA, ADAM.

22:07.870 --> 22:09.041
- I DIDN'T REALIZE
SHE WAS LIKE THAT.

22:09.180 --> 22:10.829
YOU CAN'T TRUST ANYONE.
LOOK AT THIS.

22:10.980 --> 22:13.972
- WHAT?
- TWO MISSED CALLS FROM JASMINE.

22:14.120 --> 22:15.394
- YEAH, SO?

22:15.540 --> 22:16.427
- I THINK SEKOU
RATTED ME OUT ALREADY.

22:16.570 --> 22:17.707
AND FOR THE RECORD,
I DON'T KNOW

22:17.850 --> 22:19.465
WHAT GABY REPORTED BACK
TO KRISTINA,

22:19.610 --> 22:20.952
BUT I WOULD HAVE MOPPED
THE FLOOR WITH HIM.

22:21.090 --> 22:22.159
- OH, YOU WOULD, HUH?

22:22.300 --> 22:24.052
YEAH, WELL, UH,
DID YOU CALL HER BACK YET?

22:24.200 --> 22:26.304
- NO, I DIDN'T CALL HER BACK.
WHAT AM I GONNA SAY TO HER?

22:26.440 --> 22:27.304
- YOU'RE GONNA TELL HER
THE TRUTH.

22:27.440 --> 22:28.953
YOU'RE GONNA TELL HER

22:29.100 --> 22:30.260
THAT YOU GOT DRUNK
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE AFTERNOON,

22:30.410 --> 22:32.446
THAT YOU COPPED A RIDE FROM
OUR ULTRA-HOT BEHAVIORAL AIDE

22:32.590 --> 22:33.852
SO YOU COULD PICK UP
YOUR SON,

22:34.000 --> 22:35.035
AND THEN YOU GOT BEAT UP
BY HER LITTLE BROTHER.

22:35.180 --> 22:36.249
- I DIDN'T GET BEAT UP.
- SHE'LL UNDERSTAND.

22:36.380 --> 22:38.450
- I DID NOT GET BEAT UP, OKAY?

22:38.590 --> 22:39.659
- I'LL TELL YOU WHAT,
YOU WANT MY ADVICE?

22:39.800 --> 22:41.142
- YEAH, I WANT YOUR ADVICE.

22:41.290 --> 22:42.427
- STEP ONE--APOLOGIZE TO RENEE.
- FOR WHAT?

22:42.560 --> 22:43.766
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.
- THAT'S JUST--

22:43.910 --> 22:45.639
YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU'RE A MAN,
THAT'S WHAT MEN DO.

22:45.770 --> 22:47.044
WE APOLOGIZE.
I MEAN, I SAY THREE "I'M SORRYS"

22:47.190 --> 22:48.396
WHEN I GET OUT OF BED
IN THE MORNING, OKAY?

22:48.530 --> 22:50.043
AND QUIT HALF-ASSING
YOUR DAD GIG.

22:50.190 --> 22:52.943
- WAIT A MINUTE. I AM NOT
HALF-ASSING MY DAD GIG.

22:53.090 --> 22:53.988
WHY DO YOU SAY THAT?

22:54.130 --> 22:56.189
- LISTEN, CROSBY,
YOU'RE PISSED OFF

22:56.340 --> 22:58.262
ABOUT THE WHOLE CUSTODY
SITUATION WITH JABBAR.

22:58.410 --> 23:00.025
I GET THAT, OKAY?

23:00.170 --> 23:01.785
BUT QUIT TRYING TO SELL IT
TO YOURSELF

23:01.930 --> 23:05.377
LIKE IT'S A GOOD THING
AND GO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT.

23:05.520 --> 23:07.545
- THESE ENGINES ARE STILL GOOD.

23:07.690 --> 23:09.658
I THINK ALL YOU'RE GONNA NEED
ARE SOME IGNITERS.

23:09.800 --> 23:11.825
- WHAT IS THIS?

23:14.420 --> 23:15.864
- THAT IS THE ESTES BIG DADDY.

23:16.010 --> 23:19.116
I CAN'T BELIEVE
WE NEVER SHOT THAT OFF.

23:19.250 --> 23:20.456
- IT'S HUMUNGOUS.

23:20.600 --> 23:22.773
- OH, BEAUTIFUL, ISN'T IT?

23:22.910 --> 23:25.299
IT'S GOT THE E9-4 ENGINE,
SINGLE STAGE,

23:25.430 --> 23:28.228
895 FEET OF ALTITUDE.

23:28.370 --> 23:29.678
- WOW.

23:29.820 --> 23:31.776
- IT'S GOT A DUAL-PARACHUTE
RECOVERY MODULE.

23:31.920 --> 23:34.024
MM-HMM.
BEAUTIFUL.

23:34.170 --> 23:35.239
- YEAH.

23:35.370 --> 23:37.611
I CAN'T SHOOT THAT OFF.

23:37.760 --> 23:39.478
- HOW COME?
- OH, I DON'T KNOW.

23:39.620 --> 23:41.064
UM, MAYBE A SCHOOL HAZARD.

23:41.210 --> 23:42.996
I DON'T WANT TO BURN
THE SCHOOL DOWN, SO...

23:43.140 --> 23:44.243
- OH, I'M SORRY.

23:44.380 --> 23:45.893
YOU WANT TO MAKE
A GOOD IMPRESSION, DON'T YOU?

23:46.040 --> 23:47.246
- MM-HMM.
- SO WHAT IS THE PROBLEM?

23:47.390 --> 23:49.836
- THAT WOULD DO IT--
BLOWING UP THE SCHOOL.

23:49.980 --> 23:52.289
THE PROBLEM IS
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING

23:52.430 --> 23:54.045
ABOUT THIS STUFF.

23:54.190 --> 23:55.384
- I DO.
- NO.

23:55.530 --> 23:56.667
- I'LL SHOW YOU.
- NO, NO.

23:56.810 --> 24:00.701
THAT'S NOT THE POINT, ZEEK.
[mumbling]

24:00.850 --> 24:03.296
I DON'T--I DON'T HAVE A HOBBY

24:03.440 --> 24:05.158
BECAUSE I DON'T--
I DON'T HAVE A--

24:05.300 --> 24:06.813
I DON'T HAVE A LIFE.

24:06.960 --> 24:09.952
- NOW, WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

24:10.100 --> 24:12.512
- MY WHOLE LIFE
IS--IS SYDNEY, ZEEK.

24:12.650 --> 24:14.515
I MEAN,
I-I WAKE HER UP,

24:14.660 --> 24:16.059
I GET HER READY FOR SCHOOL,
I TAKE HER,

24:16.210 --> 24:17.416
AND THEN I DO LAUNDRY,

24:17.550 --> 24:18.790
AND THEN I PICK HER UP
FROM SCHOOL.

24:18.940 --> 24:20.009
IT'S DINNER, BATH,
BEDTIME,

24:20.140 --> 24:21.380
AND THEN WAKE UP
THE NEXT MORNING,

24:21.520 --> 24:22.691
I DO IT ALL OVER AGAIN.

24:22.840 --> 24:25.729
IT'S JUST--THAT'S--
THAT'S MY JOB, YOU KNOW?

24:25.870 --> 24:28.247
AND NOW APPARENTLY
MY JOB IS TO BE THE COOL DAD

24:28.390 --> 24:31.393
WITH A COOL HOBBY
TO IMPRESS ALL HER FRIENDS.

24:31.530 --> 24:33.327
SO I MEAN,
WHAT AM I GONNA DO?

24:33.470 --> 24:36.496
I'M GONNA SHOW 'EM HOW TO USE
FABRIC SOFTENER PROPERLY?

24:36.640 --> 24:39.529
- JOEL, I MEAN, REALLY,

24:39.680 --> 24:41.329
THESE KIDS ARE KINDERGARTENERS,
ALL RIGHT?

24:41.480 --> 24:42.674
YOU COULD LIGHT YOUR OWN FART,

24:42.820 --> 24:44.333
AND THEY'D THINK
YOU WERE EINSTEIN.

24:44.480 --> 24:45.549
I MEAN, COME ON.

24:45.690 --> 24:46.850
- I KNOW.
IT'S NOT ABOUT THE KIDS.

24:47.000 --> 24:49.616
IT'S JUST--
- WELL--I MEAN, YOU KNOW...

24:49.760 --> 24:53.275
YOU ARE MAKING WAY TOO BIG
A DEAL OUT OF THIS WHOLE THING.

24:53.420 --> 24:55.695
ALL YOU GOT TO DO IS FIND
SOMETHING YOU LIKE TO DO

24:55.830 --> 24:57.070
AND THEN JUST HAVE FUN
DOING IT.

24:57.210 --> 24:59.280
IT'S NOT LIFE OR DEATH,
FOR PETE'S SAKE.

24:59.420 --> 25:00.978
YOU'RE NOT INVOLVED IN, LIKE,
MARRIAGE COUNSELING

25:01.120 --> 25:02.496
LIKE I AM
WITH CAMILLE.

25:02.630 --> 25:04.632
ALL MY KIDS ARE RAISED.
THEY GOT THEIR OWN PROBLEMS.

25:04.770 --> 25:06.499
BUT I GOT REAL PROBLEMS
GOING ON OUT THERE.

25:06.640 --> 25:07.846
OKAY?

25:07.980 --> 25:10.608
NOW, I AM GOING TO GO
TO THE HOBBY SHOP.

25:10.750 --> 25:12.945
TAKE IT EASY.
GOD.

25:13.090 --> 25:15.843
- I'M SORRY.

25:15.990 --> 25:18.163
AND I PROMISE
I'M GONNA FIGURE OUT A WAY

25:18.300 --> 25:21.189
TO EXPLAIN ALL THIS TO JABBAR
AND MAKE SURE HE KNOWS

25:21.340 --> 25:22.819
IT'S NOT OKAY TO FIGHT.

25:22.960 --> 25:24.518
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
HE DOESN'T KNOW.

25:24.660 --> 25:28.517
- DIDN'T SEKOU TELL HIM?

25:28.660 --> 25:30.070
- I'M SURE HE WANTED TO,

25:30.210 --> 25:33.338
BUT HE KNOWS THAT I WOULD
HAVE BEEN ALL OVER HIS BEHIND.

25:33.490 --> 25:35.731
- WOW.

25:35.870 --> 25:39.567
I, UM--I THOUGHT
HE WOULD HAVE...

25:39.710 --> 25:42.634
THANK YOU, RENEE.

25:42.780 --> 25:45.635
- YOU'RE WELCOME.
COME HERE. HELP ME.

25:45.780 --> 25:48.578
NO STEMS,
QUARTER-INCH PIECES.

25:48.710 --> 25:49.745
OKAY?
- OKAY.

25:49.890 --> 25:51.403
- NO STEMS,
QUARTER-INCH PIECES.

25:51.550 --> 25:53.029
- OKAY.

25:53.170 --> 25:54.432
THE SITUATION'S TOUGH,
YOU KNOW,

25:54.580 --> 25:56.468
WITH JASMINE OUT OF TOWN.

25:56.620 --> 25:59.475
I THINK WE'RE ALL JUST TRYING
TO DO THE RIGHT THING...

25:59.620 --> 26:02.180
- YOU SEE,
THAT'S NOT HOW I SEE IT.

26:02.310 --> 26:04.551
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

26:04.700 --> 26:08.659
- WELL, I LOVE MY DAUGHTER,
WOULD DO ANYTHING FOR HER,

26:08.800 --> 26:11.496
BUT WHAT I SEE HAPPENING
WITH MY GRANDSON

26:11.630 --> 26:14.144
IS NOT GOOD.

26:14.290 --> 26:16.804
- WELL, JASMINE'S A GREAT MOM.
- NOW, DON'T GET ME WRONG.

26:16.950 --> 26:19.464
I KNOW SHE'S DOING
THE BEST SHE CAN.

26:19.610 --> 26:21.054
BUT THE TRUTH IS,

26:21.200 --> 26:23.600
SHE'S BEEN DRAGGING THAT
POOR BOY ALL OVER CREATION--

26:23.750 --> 26:25.365
SUMMERS IN NEW YORK,

26:25.510 --> 26:28.502
THEN SHE MOVES HIM BACK HERE,
AND SHE GOES TO EUROPE.

26:28.650 --> 26:30.618
IT'S NOT GOOD.

26:30.760 --> 26:32.648
- YEAH, WELL,
IT'S HER DREAM.

26:32.790 --> 26:34.132
- I KNOW THAT.

26:34.280 --> 26:36.510
AND IT'S NOT GOOD
FOR THE CHILD.

26:36.660 --> 26:39.003
SO YOU NEED
TO FIGURE IT OUT.

26:39.140 --> 26:42.724
- I CAN'T JUST--
I CAN'T MAKE HER DO ANYTHING.

26:42.870 --> 26:45.930
- NO, WHEN I SAY YOU,
I DON'T MEAN YOU.

26:46.080 --> 26:47.593
I MEAN THE BOTH
OF YOU TOGETHER.

26:47.740 --> 26:50.356
CHILDREN NEED STABILITY.

26:50.500 --> 26:53.389
NOW, I KNOW IT'S MODERN
AND FASHIONABLE

26:53.540 --> 26:56.532
TO LIVE YOUR SEPARATE LIVES
AND SPLIT TIME WITH YOUR KIDS,

26:56.680 --> 26:58.716
BUT I THINK THAT IS A BUNCH
OF BULL.

26:58.850 --> 27:03.810
THAT BOY NEEDS HIS MAMA
AND HIS DADDY.

27:03.960 --> 27:07.589
SO EITHER YOU KNOW WHAT
OR GET OFF THE POT.

27:07.720 --> 27:10.234
- POOP?
POOP OR GET OFF THE POT?

27:10.380 --> 27:12.439
- [laughs]
- IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE...?

27:12.590 --> 27:14.899
- YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.
- I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.

27:15.040 --> 27:17.031
- I'M A FOOL
TO CARE

27:17.180 --> 27:19.045
- WHICH ONE IS THE METAPHASE,
AND WHICH ONE IS THE ANAPHASE?

27:19.180 --> 27:20.932
- THIS IS META--
THEY'RE ACTUALLY ON THE BACK.

27:21.080 --> 27:22.559
- OH, I SHOULD HAVE READ IT.

27:22.710 --> 27:24.496
- WHEN YOU TREAT ME...

27:24.640 --> 27:26.039
- WHERE'D THE GLUE STICK GO?

27:26.190 --> 27:27.669
COULD YOU JUST, LIKE--
HERE, COULD YOU HOLD THAT?

27:27.810 --> 27:29.983
- YES.
- OH, HERE IT IS.

27:30.130 --> 27:33.645
- I KNOW I LOVE YOU
- OKAY, GOT IT.

27:33.790 --> 27:37.021
- BUT WHAT CAN I DO?
- [chuckles]

27:37.170 --> 27:39.263
- I'M A FOOL...
- ARE YOU OKAY?

27:39.410 --> 27:42.163
- ME? YEAH.
YEAH, TOTALLY, UH, FINE.

27:42.310 --> 27:43.959
UH, METAPHASE.

27:44.110 --> 27:45.589
- ALL RIGHT, JUST...

27:45.730 --> 27:50.758
- I'M A FOOL TO CRY

27:50.910 --> 27:57.349
WHEN YOU TELL ME GOOD-BYE

27:57.500 --> 27:59.525
- UH, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

27:59.670 --> 28:01.228
- OH, MY GOD.

28:01.360 --> 28:04.227
OH, MY GOD, HOLLY,
I'M SO, SO, SO--I'M SO SORRY.

28:04.370 --> 28:07.021
I CAN'T EVEN LOOK AT--
- OH, MY GOD.

28:07.160 --> 28:08.787
- I THOUGHT YOU WERE, LIKE,
GIVING ME THIS SIGN.

28:08.920 --> 28:09.887
- NO.

28:10.030 --> 28:11.782
I GOT TO GO.
- WAIT, DREW--

28:11.930 --> 28:13.682
- HOLLY, I CAN'T GO.
THIS IS MY HOUSE.

28:13.830 --> 28:15.479
CAN YOU JUST GO?
- DREW, I'M SO SORRY.

28:15.620 --> 28:16.996
I LIKE YOU.
NO, I DO.

28:17.140 --> 28:18.448
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO SAY THIS.
- YOU'RE SMART.

28:18.590 --> 28:20.069
- SERIOUSLY, JUST PLEASE GO.

28:20.210 --> 28:21.620
- I THOUGHT WE WERE JUST DOING--
- WILL YOU PLEASE GO?

28:21.760 --> 28:23.557
- SO WHY SHOULD I PRETEND?

28:23.700 --> 28:27.147
I LOSE IN THE END

28:27.290 --> 28:29.736
I'M A FOOL TO CARE

28:29.880 --> 28:31.529
[door closes]

28:31.670 --> 28:33.080
- [sighs]

28:36.990 --> 28:38.321
- OKAY, EVERYBODY,
NOW, YOU READY?

28:38.470 --> 28:41.394
THIS LAST ONE
IS REALLY SPECIAL.

28:41.540 --> 28:46.091
IT'S AN EAGLE SILVER DOLLAR
MINTED IN 1796.

28:46.240 --> 28:49.789
THAT'S OVER 200 YEARS AGO.

28:49.930 --> 28:50.919
- CAN WE TOUCH IT?

28:51.070 --> 28:52.446
- SORRY.
SORRY.

28:52.590 --> 28:53.614
YOUR FINGERS MIGHT MESS IT UP.

28:53.760 --> 28:55.307
IT'S WORTH OVER $30,000.

28:55.450 --> 28:57.862
- WHY, THANK YOU VERY MUCH,
MR. FITTS.

28:58.010 --> 28:59.454
WASN'T THAT GREAT,
EVERYBODY?

28:59.590 --> 29:02.218
THANK YOU, MR. FITTS.
[cheers and applause]

29:02.360 --> 29:03.588
THANK YOU.

29:03.740 --> 29:07.324
THE NEXT PRESENTATION
IS BY SYDNEY'S FATHER.

29:07.460 --> 29:09.428
CAN WE SAY,
"GOOD AFTERNOON, MR. GRAHAM"?

29:09.570 --> 29:13.609
all: GOOD AFTERNOON,
MR. GRAHAM.

29:13.750 --> 29:16.537
- HI.
GOOD AFTERNOON, GUYS.

29:16.680 --> 29:18.784
- WHAT'S IN THE BOX?

29:18.920 --> 29:20.433
- LET ME ASK YOU THIS.

29:20.580 --> 29:25.062
DO YOU GUYS LIKE WOOD?

29:30.250 --> 29:31.342
- HOW ABOUT THESE PANTS?

29:31.490 --> 29:33.936
- NO, I LIKE THESE CLOTHES
THAT I HAVE.

29:34.080 --> 29:35.411
- IF YOU TRY THESE ON,

29:35.560 --> 29:37.243
I'LL GIVE YOU A STICKER.
- ONE PAIR.

29:37.390 --> 29:39.358
ONE PAIR.

29:39.500 --> 29:41.047
JUST ONE.

29:41.190 --> 29:42.873
- IT'S WORKING.
- HEY, UNCLE CROSBY.

29:43.020 --> 29:44.351
- HEY.
- IT'S FRUSTRATING.

29:44.500 --> 29:46.229
- I'M JUST, UH, HERE
TO GET MY LAUNDRY.

29:46.370 --> 29:48.224
- OH, AND, MOM,
BY "ONE PAIR,"

29:48.370 --> 29:50.531
I MEAN YOU ONLY GET ONE PAIR
PER STICKER.

29:50.680 --> 29:52.090
- I UNDERSTAND THAT.

29:52.230 --> 29:53.470
- SO IF YOU WANT ME
TO TRY ON ANOTHER PAIR,

29:53.610 --> 29:55.430
YOU HAVE TO GIVE ME
ANOTHER STICKER.

29:55.580 --> 29:58.231
- HEY, UM...

29:58.380 --> 30:00.541
I WANTED TO SAY SORRY
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED

30:00.690 --> 30:01.827
THE OTHER DAY.

30:01.970 --> 30:04.552
THAT WAS NOT MY FINEST
PARENTING HOUR.

30:04.690 --> 30:05.861
- IT'S OKAY.

30:06.010 --> 30:07.272
I FEEL
LIKE I SHOULD APOLOGIZE.

30:07.420 --> 30:08.967
I SHOULDN'T HAVE TOLD KRISTINA.
I'M SORRY.

30:09.110 --> 30:11.556
SHE SORT OF GOT IT
OUT OF ME, YOU KNOW?

30:11.700 --> 30:13.975
- SHE'S LIKE
A COLD WAR INTERROGATOR, YEAH.

30:14.120 --> 30:15.769
- [laughs]

30:15.910 --> 30:19.494
- UM, HEY,
CAN I ASK YOU A QUESTION?

30:19.640 --> 30:22.256
- SURE.

30:22.400 --> 30:25.369
- DO YOU THINK I'M HALF-ASSING
MY GIG AS A DAD

30:25.510 --> 30:27.887
IF I LET JABBAR LIVE
AT HIS GRANDMA'S?

30:30.650 --> 30:32.163
- I DON'T KNOW.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

30:32.310 --> 30:35.302
- HMM. IS THAT
LIKE A WEIRD THERAPY TRICK,

30:35.450 --> 30:36.758
WHERE YOU ANSWER A QUESTION
WITH A QUESTION?

30:36.900 --> 30:39.107
- KIND OF SORT OF.

30:39.250 --> 30:40.558
AND IF YOU'RE GOOD,
YOU MIGHT GET A STICKER.

30:40.700 --> 30:44.454
- [sighs]

30:44.600 --> 30:46.420
I DON'T KNOW.

30:46.560 --> 30:48.357
LOOK, I WANT
WHAT'S BEST FOR JABBAR,

30:48.500 --> 30:50.388
AND HE LOVES RENEE,
AND, YOU KNOW,

30:50.530 --> 30:52.669
SHE'S REALLY GOOD
AT TAKING CARE OF HIM.

30:52.810 --> 30:55.461
AND IT'S WHAT JASMINE WANTS,

30:55.610 --> 30:58.010
BUT...

30:58.160 --> 30:59.604
I DON'T KNOW.

30:59.750 --> 31:01.889
- IT DOESN'T FEEL RIGHT.

31:02.030 --> 31:03.429
- YEAH, EXACTLY.

31:03.580 --> 31:07.755
I MEAN, I LOVE HIM TO DEATH,
SO, YOU KNOW,

31:07.900 --> 31:12.439
MAYBE I SHOULD JUST STEP UP
AND TAKE ON THE WHOLE ENCHILADA.

31:12.590 --> 31:14.933
- OKAY,
SO WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

31:15.080 --> 31:16.968
- WELL, THE PROBLEM IS--

31:17.110 --> 31:19.032
AND I HOPE
THIS DOESN'T SHOCK YOU...

31:19.180 --> 31:20.693
[whispering]
BUT I'M A BIT OF A SCREW-UP.

31:20.840 --> 31:23.252
AND TO BE TOTALLY HONEST,

31:23.390 --> 31:24.834
I KIND OF LIKE MY FREEDOM.

31:24.980 --> 31:27.801
THEN I THINK,
"MAN, HOW SELFISH.

31:27.950 --> 31:30.498
WHAT KIND OF DAD DOESN'T WANT TO
BE WITH HIS KID ALL THE TIME?"

31:30.640 --> 31:33.052
THEN I GO, "OH, MAYBE THE KIND
THAT WILL FALL ASLEEP

31:33.200 --> 31:35.191
"WHILE HE'S SWIMMING
OR FORGET TO PICK HIM UP

31:35.340 --> 31:36.853
"AT SOCCER PRACTICE
OR, YOU KNOW, FEEDS HIM

31:36.990 --> 31:39.094
THE WRONG TYPE OF LACTAID--"

31:39.240 --> 31:40.309
- CROSBY?
- YEAH.

31:40.450 --> 31:41.929
I KNOW.
I'M ALL OVER THE PLACE.

31:42.070 --> 31:44.447
- NO, I JUST--

31:44.590 --> 31:47.559
I THINK YOU'D BE
A GREAT FULL-TIME DAD.

31:50.080 --> 31:52.310
- FOR REAL?
- MM-HMM.

31:52.460 --> 31:56.317
- THANK YOU.
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

31:56.460 --> 31:59.349
- NO WAY.
WHO DID THIS?

31:59.500 --> 32:01.707
WAS THAT YOU?
THAT IS SUPER COOL.

32:01.850 --> 32:03.044
- WHAT IS IT?

32:03.190 --> 32:04.293
- MORE PAPER?
OKAY, I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

32:04.430 --> 32:05.943
OH, THAT'S COOL, GUYS.

32:06.090 --> 32:08.650
HEY, IS THIS GOING
ON THE FRONT OF THAT?

32:08.780 --> 32:11.954
- YEAH.
- YOU KNOW WHAT YOU CAN DO?

32:12.100 --> 32:13.749
YOU GUYS NEEDS MORE?

32:13.890 --> 32:15.642
OKAY.

32:15.790 --> 32:17.610
- OKAY, BRILLIANT.

32:17.760 --> 32:18.966
ARE YOU FREE NEXT WEEK?

32:19.100 --> 32:20.510
- OH, YEAH.

32:20.660 --> 32:22.412
THEY'RE KIND OF INTO IT, RIGHT?
- OH, GOD, YEAH.

32:22.560 --> 32:23.720
YEAH.

32:23.870 --> 32:25.178
- I'M MAKING THE HAMSTER.

32:25.320 --> 32:26.764
HIS NAME IS ERNIE.

32:26.910 --> 32:29.697
- THAT'S A GOOD NAME.
- YOUR DAD IS AWESOME.

32:29.840 --> 32:31.353
- I KNOW.

32:34.980 --> 32:37.187
- HONEY, I NEED YOU
TO PUT DOWN THE GAME AND EAT.

32:37.330 --> 32:39.184
- I CAN'T.
PEAS GOT ON THE MACARONI.

32:39.330 --> 32:40.501
- UGH, BABE,
IT'S FINE.

32:40.640 --> 32:41.709
YOU NEED TO EAT YOUR SUPPER.
- NO, IT'S NOT!

32:41.850 --> 32:43.021
PEAS GOT ON THE MACARONI.

32:43.160 --> 32:44.570
I JUST TOLD YOU
IT'S NOT FINE.

32:44.720 --> 32:45.857
- WHERE'S YOUR FATHER?

32:45.990 --> 32:47.196
- HE'S PROBABLY WORKING.

32:47.340 --> 32:49.069
HE SAID HE HAS
TO DO COST REPORTS.

32:49.200 --> 32:51.202
- HEY, MOM, CAN I--
WHAT? WAIT.

32:51.340 --> 32:52.307
WHAT ARE YOU--

32:52.450 --> 32:53.758
OH, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I WANTED TO TALK

32:53.900 --> 32:55.481
TO YOU ABOUT YOUR SPEECH.
I THINK YOU SHOULD ADD IN

32:55.620 --> 32:56.757
THAT YOU WERE ROOM REP
IN EIGHTH GRADE.

32:56.900 --> 32:58.549
I THINK IT'S A PHENOMENAL IDEA.

32:58.700 --> 33:00.099
- UH-HUH.
RIGHT.

33:00.250 --> 33:01.558
THAT JUST WOULDN'T REALLY FIT
INTO MY SPEECH.

33:01.700 --> 33:03.452
- YES, IT WOULD.

33:03.600 --> 33:06.148
- RIGHT, WELL, AUNT SARAH AND I
REPLACED THAT PART WITH A JOKE.

33:06.290 --> 33:07.496
- WHAT'D YOU SAY?

33:07.640 --> 33:09.289
- UM, NOTHING.
IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL.

33:09.430 --> 33:10.533
- AUNT SARAH?
- IT WAS JUST FUNNIER THAT WAY.

33:10.670 --> 33:12.979
[car horn honks]
- HONEY, THE SPEECH WAS PERFECT.

33:13.120 --> 33:14.564
- I HAVE TO GO.
- WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

33:14.710 --> 33:16.507
- UH, A BASKETBALL GAME,
AND THEY'RE ANNOUNCING

33:16.640 --> 33:17.743
THE CANDIDATES,
AND IT'S REQUIRED.

33:17.890 --> 33:19.289
OTHERWISE--I DIDN'T KNOW.

33:19.440 --> 33:20.600
- YOU'RE NOT GOING
BECAUSE YOU'RE BABYSITTING.

33:20.750 --> 33:22.194
- NO, I HAVE TO GO.
- THAT'S WHY I'M ALL DRESSED UP.

33:22.340 --> 33:23.648
- NO, I CAN STAY BY MYSELF.

33:23.790 --> 33:26.304
- THERE'S SOMEONE HONKING
IN THE DRIVEWAY.

33:26.450 --> 33:28.418
HEY, WHY IS OUR BABYSITTER
HEADING OUT THE FRONT DOOR?

33:28.550 --> 33:29.539
HADDIE!

33:29.690 --> 33:31.169
AT HALFTIME
WITH THE CANDIDATES.

33:31.310 --> 33:32.754
I DON'T KNOW.
I TOLD HER SHE HAD TO DO IT,

33:32.900 --> 33:33.764
AND SHE'S A SNOT.

33:33.900 --> 33:35.276
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

33:35.420 --> 33:36.409
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
WE'RE NOT GOING OUT, HONEY.

33:36.560 --> 33:37.629
THIS IS TOO HARD.
- NO. NO, NO, NO, NO.

33:37.770 --> 33:38.930
WE ARE GOING OUT.

33:39.080 --> 33:40.422

33:42.390 --> 33:44.358
I AM GOING

33:44.500 --> 33:46.422
- WELL, THANK YOU.
YOUR DAD AND YOUR MOM?

33:46.570 --> 33:48.561
YOUR DAD TAKES, LIKE, FOUR HOURS
TO LEAVE THE HOUSE.

33:48.710 --> 33:51.361
- I WILL TELL THEM TO HURRY.
WE ARE GOING OUT.

33:52.610 --> 33:53.747
- OKAY.

33:53.890 --> 33:56.199
IT'S NOT BASTIDE,
BUT IT'S SOMETHING.

IT'S KITSCHY, IT'S FUN.

34:00.480 --> 34:01.856
I JUST WANTED EVERYTHING

34:02.000 --> 34:03.888
- IT IS PERFECT, OKAY?

34:04.040 --> 34:06.315
WE'RE ALONE. WE'RE TOGETHER.

34:40.180 --> 34:42.102
RIGHT HERE
AT THIS TABLE.

34:42.250 --> 34:45.003

35:07.930 --> 35:08.954
YOU NEVER WEAR THAT.

35:09.100 --> 35:11.375
IS IT SOMETHING SPECIAL
FOR SOMEONE SPECIAL?

35:11.520 --> 35:15.968
- UM, UH, NO, MOM,

35:31.810 --> 35:33.254
I TRIED TO KISS HER,
OKAY?

35:33.400 --> 35:34.606
AND SHE TOTALLY REJECTED ME.

35:34.750 --> 35:36.570
NOW SHE HATES ME.
- OH, HONEY, I'M SORRY.

35:36.720 --> 35:38.290
- LOOK, I DON'T CARE, MOM,
IF YOU'RE SORRY,

35:38.440 --> 35:41.193
HONESTLY, BECAUSE, LOOK,
I'VE TOLD YOU

35:41.340 --> 35:42.500
I DON'T WANT YOUR ADVICE.

35:42.650 --> 35:43.719
I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY TIMES

35:43.860 --> 35:45.373
I'VE TOLD YOU THAT,
AND YOU JUST KEEP

35:45.520 --> 35:47.579
TELLING ME THINGS, AND I DON'T
KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH IT.

35:47.730 --> 35:49.379

36:17.030 --> 36:21.615
WE MIGHT NEED YOU
TO CALL THE FIRE DEPARTMENT.

36:35.530 --> 36:39.227
JIMMY KOOP ASKED ME
TO THE EIGHTH-GRADE DANCE.

36:39.360 --> 36:41.817
HE WAS REALLY SMART...

36:41.950 --> 36:43.679

36:43.820 --> 36:46.288
I WAS SO EXCITED.

36:46.440 --> 36:47.646
HE SAID HE'D MEET ME THERE.

36:47.790 --> 36:50.998
AND I STOOD OUT
IN FRONT OF THE GYM...

36:51.130 --> 36:53.405
AND WAITED.

36:55.210 --> 36:56.131
AND I WAITED.

36:56.280 --> 36:58.510
AND I WAITED.

36:58.660 --> 37:02.244
AND HE NEVER SHOWED UP.

WHEN DAD CAME TO PICK ME UP,
I WAS CRYING AND CRYING.

37:07.430 --> 37:11.116

"SWEETHEART,
BOYS ARE LIKE BUSES.

37:15.710 --> 37:18.838
IF YOU MISS ONE,
THERE'S ANOTHER ONE COMING."

37:26.380 --> 37:29.406
- HEY, MOM...

37:29.550 --> 37:30.960
I KNOW IT WASN'T YOUR FAULT
DAD LEFT.

37:31.110 --> 37:32.509
I SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID THAT.

37:34.940 --> 37:38.410
- IT'S OKAY, SWEETHEART.

37:38.560 --> 37:41.620
I MISS HIM SOMETIMES TOO.

37:54.510 --> 37:57.092

37:57.240 --> 37:59.196
- NO, NO, I ALREADY KNOW
HOW TO TIE MY SHOES.

38:35.380 --> 38:37.405
- HOW COME?

38:37.550 --> 38:39.586
- WELL, YOU KNOW,
I JUST ALWAYS THOUGHT

38:39.730 --> 38:41.721
THAT IT WAS EVERYTHING
THAT I WANTED,

38:41.870 --> 38:44.759
AND FOR TWO HOURS EVERY NIGHT
DURING PERFORMANCES,

38:44.900 --> 38:46.652
IT WAS AMAZING,
AND IT WAS WONDERFUL.

38:46.800 --> 38:49.428
BUT THE REST OF THE TIME
WAS LIVING OUT OF SUITCASES

38:49.560 --> 38:51.243
AND FEELING SAD AND LONELY

38:51.390 --> 38:52.971
AND MISSING MY FAMILY.
