This place is awful. It's like
The Sharper Image took a shit in here.

01:31:53.106 --> 01:31:54.300
Five. Forty, with the briefcase.

01:31:54.474 --> 01:31:57.068
Oh, shut up about the briefcase.

01:31:57.243 --> 01:32:01.043

Now I'm sneezing dust bunnies.
Is that diabetes?

01:32:46.760 --> 01:32:48.751
I'm a pharmacist, not a doctor.

01:32:48.928 --> 01:32:50.657
Is that my brain?
Take my temperature.

01:32:50.830 --> 01:32:52.263
Have you any, uh, roofies?

01:32:52.432 --> 01:32:54.263

Wouldn't mind bending her over a barrel
and showing her the 50 states.

01:33:32.906 --> 01:33:34.305
I don't know what that means.

01:33:34.474 --> 01:33:36.442
