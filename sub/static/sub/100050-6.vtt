00:07.485 --> 00:10.358
Previously onYoung Sheldon...MISSY: Dad,

00:10.401 --> 00:12.273
you busy?What do you want?

00:12.316 --> 00:14.014
Would you teach me how
to throw a baseball?

00:15.102 --> 00:17.365
That one had some zip on it.

00:17.408 --> 00:18.844
You might be a natural.

00:18.888 --> 00:21.282
Look who I brought.

00:21.325 --> 00:24.154
I don't normally do
this, but put her there.

00:24.198 --> 00:26.765
No mitten. I'm honored.

00:27.505 --> 00:28.767
We've never really discussed

00:28.811 --> 00:30.726
the status of our relationship.

00:30.769 --> 00:33.120
As far as I'm
concerned, we just...

00:33.163 --> 00:35.557
pick up right
where we left off.

00:35.600 --> 00:38.299
I think it's for the best
if we don't.
What?

00:38.342 --> 00:41.737
I don't think we should be in
a romantic relationship anymore.

00:41.780 --> 00:43.043
Are you crazy?

00:43.086 --> 00:45.306
I mean, poor choice
of words, but...

00:45.349 --> 00:47.525
are you crazy?!

00:52.704 --> 00:54.228
You wanted to see me, Pastor?

00:54.271 --> 00:57.274
Cop a squat.Uh, please, have a seat.

00:58.275 --> 01:00.103
I just wanted to thank you

01:00.147 --> 01:02.323
for all the work you've done
preparing for the carnival.

01:02.366 --> 01:03.802
Anything for the church.

01:03.846 --> 01:06.109
I'm so glad you said that.

01:06.153 --> 01:08.807
How would you feel if...

01:10.287 --> 01:13.160
...we put Sheldon
in the dunk tank?

01:13.203 --> 01:15.988
What? No.
Aw.

01:16.032 --> 01:17.773
But imagine how much
people would pay to dunk him.

01:17.816 --> 01:18.904
We'd raise so much money.

01:18.948 --> 01:20.428
I'm in for $20, easy.

01:20.471 --> 01:23.735
I'm not having people
throw baseballs at my son.

01:23.779 --> 01:25.781
They throw them at a target.
He's in a cage.

01:25.824 --> 01:27.783
No!Boo.

01:27.826 --> 01:30.002
Okay. I respect your decision.

01:30.046 --> 01:31.265
Is that all?

01:31.308 --> 01:33.005
Yes.

01:37.053 --> 01:39.011
Well, damn.

01:39.055 --> 01:41.144
I do so much for you.

01:41.188 --> 01:44.147
♪ Nobody else
is stronger than I am ♪

01:44.191 --> 01:47.281
♪ Yesterday I moved a mountain

01:47.324 --> 01:49.718
♪ I bet I could be your hero

01:49.761 --> 01:51.894
♪ I am a mighty little man

01:51.937 --> 01:56.116
♪ I am a mighty little man.♪

02:00.207 --> 02:02.296
Everybody excited
for the carnival?

02:02.339 --> 02:03.862
Sure.I am.

02:07.344 --> 02:09.303
Pass.You're still going.

02:09.346 --> 02:11.261
What time do I need
to be there to set up?

02:11.305 --> 02:13.002
Noon's fine.

02:13.045 --> 02:14.264
What, you're helping out?

02:14.308 --> 02:16.179
Yeah.Why?

02:16.223 --> 02:18.964
I want to support Mom. And God.

02:19.008 --> 02:21.402
You're just doing it 'cause
Veronica's gonna be there.

02:21.445 --> 02:23.447
And who made Veronica?

02:24.666 --> 02:26.407
Mm. Mom?

02:26.450 --> 02:28.365
What?You're coming with us, right?

02:28.409 --> 02:30.062
No, I'm not.

02:30.106 --> 02:32.152
Come on, it'll be fun.

02:32.195 --> 02:34.110
The old lady wants to be cranky
and alone.

02:34.154 --> 02:36.068
You got to respect that.

02:36.112 --> 02:37.635
I'm not cranky.

02:37.679 --> 02:39.333
And I'm sick
of everybody thinking

02:39.376 --> 02:42.205
that they know
what's best for me.

02:46.340 --> 02:48.342
Hey, did everybody see

02:48.385 --> 02:51.388
there's a sale at RadioShack
on nine-volt batteries?

02:52.476 --> 02:55.392
It's a golden
opportunity to stock up.

02:59.048 --> 03:00.092
Mom?

03:00.136 --> 03:01.398
Yeah, baby.

03:01.442 --> 03:04.227
Missy said that Meemaw
is upset at Dr. Sturgis.

03:04.271 --> 03:06.011
Don't worry, she'll get over it.

03:06.055 --> 03:07.448
The question is
will she get over it

03:07.491 --> 03:09.101
by Friday at 4:00 p.m.?

03:09.145 --> 03:10.799
That's when we
leave for my class.

03:10.842 --> 03:12.409
I don't know, Shelly.

03:12.453 --> 03:14.846
I suppose she could drop me
off outside. Where are we

03:14.890 --> 03:17.632
on me walking through parking
lots alone these days?

03:17.675 --> 03:19.373
How about this?

03:19.416 --> 03:22.332
Um, until she's up to it,
I'll take you.

03:22.376 --> 03:25.248
Thanks. The parking lot
still gives me the willies.

03:25.292 --> 03:28.120
Hey, do you want to help me
paint these posters?

03:28.164 --> 03:29.600
Not at all.

03:31.167 --> 03:34.126
Oh, yeah, people would line up
for that dunk tank.

03:34.170 --> 03:35.127
Stop.

03:35.171 --> 03:37.347
Oh! Another one.

03:37.391 --> 03:38.609
He's having a field day.

03:38.653 --> 03:40.089
Yeah.

03:40.132 --> 03:42.134
Hey. We're getting ready
to head over to the carnival.

03:42.178 --> 03:43.353
Good for you.

03:43.397 --> 03:44.833
Why don't you come with us?

03:44.876 --> 03:47.488
Because I'm quite content
right where I am.

03:47.531 --> 03:50.273
Don't you think it'll be nice
to get out of the house?

03:50.317 --> 03:52.406
I can't believe
I didn't think of that.

03:52.449 --> 03:54.495
What a great idea.

03:54.538 --> 03:56.497
Thank you.So you're coming?

03:56.540 --> 03:58.586
No.

03:58.629 --> 04:00.892
Still cranky.

04:00.936 --> 04:03.112
I can't find an umbrella.

04:03.155 --> 04:04.200
What do you need
an umbrella for?

04:04.244 --> 04:05.506
It's gonna be hot and sunny.

04:05.549 --> 04:07.508
I think you've answered
your own question.

04:10.337 --> 04:12.295
Does he really have to
walk around with that?

04:12.339 --> 04:13.427
He's fine.

04:13.470 --> 04:14.863
Leave him be.You're just begging

04:14.906 --> 04:16.386
to get beat up.

04:16.430 --> 04:19.389
I'm more concerned about the
biggest bully of all: the Sun.

04:28.137 --> 04:30.313
I bet you're disappointed

04:30.357 --> 04:32.446
that cute little
blonde girl got sick

04:32.489 --> 04:33.795
and you're working with me.

04:33.838 --> 04:35.187
I guess.

04:35.231 --> 04:37.494
You're gonna learn
life's like that.

04:37.538 --> 04:39.801
A parade of disappointments.

04:39.844 --> 04:41.324
Is that so?

04:41.368 --> 04:43.718
Yep. Sooner you give up,
the better.

04:43.761 --> 04:45.502
When did you give up?

04:45.546 --> 04:49.332
June 14, 1945.

04:49.376 --> 04:52.204
The man I loved came home
from the war with syphilis.

04:53.684 --> 04:56.296
Now ask me how I found out.

04:56.339 --> 04:57.645
No, thank you.

04:59.690 --> 05:02.345
You must be Cain,
because you're not Abel...

05:02.389 --> 05:04.173
to hit the target.

05:04.216 --> 05:06.915
Oh, hello, Coopers.

05:06.958 --> 05:08.525
Pastor Jeff.

05:08.569 --> 05:10.484
Expecting rain, Sheldon?

05:10.527 --> 05:12.877
No. In this context,
it's a parasol

05:12.921 --> 05:15.053
from the French "para"
meaning "defense from"

05:15.097 --> 05:16.316
and "sol"meaning "sun."

05:17.404 --> 05:18.840
Please, Mary.

05:18.883 --> 05:19.841
No.

05:19.884 --> 05:21.495
Will you dunk him?

05:21.538 --> 05:22.931
Oh, you got it.

05:27.805 --> 05:30.547
You might want to pray
to the Lord for better aim.

05:33.637 --> 05:35.247
I'll get you started.

05:35.291 --> 05:39.077
Uh, Lord, help George Cooper hit
something other than the buffet.

05:40.078 --> 05:43.081
Sorry. Trash talk's
part of the job.

05:43.125 --> 05:44.866
Can I throw one?

05:44.909 --> 05:46.911
Sure.

05:49.436 --> 05:51.176
Okay, now,
remember what I taught you.

05:51.220 --> 05:54.049
Look where you're throwing
and follow through.

05:54.092 --> 05:55.267
Uh-oh!

05:55.311 --> 05:56.573
Dad's bringing in

05:56.617 --> 05:58.793
the big guns.
Let's see what you've got,

05:58.836 --> 06:01.056
little l...

06:01.099 --> 06:02.100
Yes!

06:02.144 --> 06:03.798
Yes!

06:03.841 --> 06:07.062
I am baptized once again.

06:08.019 --> 06:09.456
So...

06:09.499 --> 06:11.806
I shacked up with him anyway.

06:11.849 --> 06:13.416
Uh-huh.

06:13.460 --> 06:14.896
I mean, what choice did I have?

06:14.939 --> 06:17.899
I was pregnant
with I don't know whose baby.

06:17.942 --> 06:19.291
Uh-huh.

06:19.335 --> 06:21.903
Sleeping on my cousin
Arlene's couch.

06:21.946 --> 06:24.384
Which was in her front yard.

06:24.427 --> 06:26.124
Uh-huh.

06:34.306 --> 06:35.656
Why, Lord?

06:37.484 --> 06:39.747
Six in a row!

06:39.790 --> 06:41.662
I taught her how to do that.

06:41.705 --> 06:42.924
MAN:
I bet you did.

06:42.967 --> 06:44.534
This is a lot of fun,

06:44.578 --> 06:47.624
but why don't we let
somebody else take a shot?

06:47.668 --> 06:49.757
CROWD :
Missy! Missy!

06:49.800 --> 06:52.760
Missy! Missy! Missy!

06:52.803 --> 06:55.023
Missy! Missy!

06:55.066 --> 06:56.633
Seven!

07:08.340 --> 07:10.212
Hit him!

07:10.255 --> 07:12.127
Hit him again.

07:14.521 --> 07:15.957
MARY:
Hello?

07:16.000 --> 07:17.437
What?

07:17.480 --> 07:19.743
Have you been on
the couch all day?

07:19.787 --> 07:20.831
No.

07:20.875 --> 07:22.354
For your information, I got up,

07:22.398 --> 07:24.269
put my slippers on,
crossed the street,

07:24.313 --> 07:27.229
broke into your house
and stole your beer.Mom.

07:27.272 --> 07:28.970
But listen, if you've just
come over here to badger me,

07:29.013 --> 07:30.014
please don't.

07:30.058 --> 07:31.363
Fine.

07:31.407 --> 07:33.931
I brought you fried
chicken from the carnival.

07:33.975 --> 07:36.151
I don't need your pity chicken.

07:36.194 --> 07:38.022
Look, I know
you're having a tough time.

07:38.066 --> 07:39.546
I'm fine.

07:39.589 --> 07:41.199
Okay.

07:41.243 --> 07:44.681
Does that mean you'll still take
Sheldon to Dr. Sturgis's class?

07:44.725 --> 07:45.900
No.

07:47.075 --> 07:48.555
But I'm fine.

07:48.598 --> 07:50.034
So you won't mind if I take him?

07:50.078 --> 07:51.383
Do whatever you want.

07:51.427 --> 07:52.820
See, when you say it like that,

07:52.863 --> 07:54.212
it sounds like you might mind.

07:54.256 --> 07:55.518
How about this?

07:55.562 --> 07:57.259
Darling daughter, please,

07:57.302 --> 08:00.218
do whatever it is
that makes you happy.

08:00.262 --> 08:02.438
If you're gonna act like this,
then I'm gonna leave.

08:02.482 --> 08:05.441
Oh, no. And after
I didn't open the door for you?

08:06.486 --> 08:07.530
Hey, wait.

08:07.574 --> 08:09.706
Get me a beer.
No.

08:09.750 --> 08:11.578
Well, at least get me
some chicken!

08:12.622 --> 08:14.537
Dad, can I talk to you?

08:14.581 --> 08:16.234
GEORGE SR.:
Uh, can it wait a minute?

08:16.278 --> 08:17.758
MISSY:
It's pretty important.

08:17.801 --> 08:19.237
GEORGE SR.:
So's this.

08:20.630 --> 08:22.458
What?

08:22.502 --> 08:23.894
I've been thinking
about how much I enjoyed

08:23.938 --> 08:25.374
throwing that ball today.

08:25.417 --> 08:26.723
You did great, honey.

08:26.767 --> 08:29.073
I know. That's why I
want to play on a team.

08:29.117 --> 08:31.815
You get that dunk tank
isn't a sport?

08:31.859 --> 08:33.077
I mean baseball.

08:33.121 --> 08:34.426
Okay, sure.

08:34.470 --> 08:36.603
They don't have
any baseball teams for girls.

08:36.646 --> 08:38.474
Wait a few years,
you can play softball.

08:38.518 --> 08:40.476
I don't want to wait. I
want to play baseball.

08:40.520 --> 08:41.912
But you'd be the only girl.

08:41.956 --> 08:43.479
I don't care.

08:43.523 --> 08:45.263
Okay, well...

08:45.307 --> 08:47.570
I-I guess I can look into it.

08:47.614 --> 08:49.441
Thanks, Daddy.

08:49.485 --> 08:51.487
Sure you don't want
to play soccer or something?

08:51.531 --> 08:52.662
Nope!

08:52.706 --> 08:54.795
Cheerleading?Baseball!

08:54.838 --> 08:56.144
Yeah.

08:57.885 --> 08:59.930
Right, y-yes.

08:59.974 --> 09:02.498
Is it too late to sign
someone up for youth league?

09:02.542 --> 09:04.065
Okay.

09:04.108 --> 09:06.502
Well, we'll see you then.
Thanks.

09:08.199 --> 09:09.505
Missy want to
play ball?

09:09.549 --> 09:12.421
How do you know
I wasn't calling for Sheldon?

09:13.857 --> 09:15.598
Fine, it was Missy.

09:19.167 --> 09:21.125
There's my favorite fire exit.

09:21.169 --> 09:23.606
Very well marked.Nice.

09:23.650 --> 09:25.608
Ooh. See that
little step stool?

09:25.652 --> 09:27.958
They didn't have that
before Igot here.

09:28.002 --> 09:29.830
Very impressive.
I know.

09:32.093 --> 09:34.835
And this is where I take
my quantum field theory class.

09:34.878 --> 09:37.054
Those are my college classmates.
I would tell you

09:37.098 --> 09:39.796
their names, but most of them
won't make it to Christmas.

09:45.541 --> 09:47.151
Got your beer.

09:47.195 --> 09:48.979
They give you any problem?

09:49.023 --> 09:51.025
Nah.

09:52.026 --> 09:52.983
Change.

09:53.027 --> 09:54.855
You keep it.

09:56.378 --> 09:57.640
Hey.

09:59.163 --> 10:01.426
I may be too drunk to drive,

10:01.470 --> 10:04.081
but I still can count to six.

10:07.694 --> 10:09.826
Well, hello, Sheldon.
Hello, Mary.

10:09.870 --> 10:12.829
I don't think I've ever
seen you here before.

10:12.873 --> 10:13.961
It's my first time.

10:14.004 --> 10:15.527
Huh.I took her on a tour.

10:15.571 --> 10:17.965
It was extremely thorough.

10:18.008 --> 10:19.488
So, uh...

10:19.531 --> 10:21.882
how's Connie?Actually...

10:21.925 --> 10:22.926
Sheldon, why don't you

10:22.970 --> 10:24.188
go save me a seat?
SHELDON:
Smart.

10:24.232 --> 10:26.364
The front row is
a hot ticket.

10:27.539 --> 10:30.020
Anyway, uh, Mom's good.

10:30.064 --> 10:33.023
Because she's usually the
one who brings Sheldon.

10:33.067 --> 10:35.156
Well, she's been...

10:35.199 --> 10:37.462
pretty busy lately.

10:37.506 --> 10:40.683
Relationships are
a waste of time.

10:40.727 --> 10:42.859
Flying solo is
the only way to go.

10:42.903 --> 10:44.382
Uh-huh.

10:44.426 --> 10:46.950
Do you think Tarzan
was happy with Jane?

10:46.994 --> 10:48.560
No way.

10:48.604 --> 10:51.389
He was happy swinging
through the trees.

10:51.433 --> 10:52.869
Uh-huh.

10:52.913 --> 10:54.915
The Statue of Liberty--
she's got her book

10:54.958 --> 10:57.265
and her torch,
and she's good.

10:57.308 --> 10:58.658
Uh-huh.

10:58.701 --> 11:01.748
I'm glad she's doing well.
Tell her I say hi.

11:01.791 --> 11:03.706
I will do that.Actually, no.

11:03.750 --> 11:05.708
Uh, tell her I said hello.

11:05.752 --> 11:08.755
"Hi" is a bit, uh,
casual. Or wait.

11:08.798 --> 11:10.060
Greetings.

11:10.104 --> 11:13.455
Just say, uh,
"Greetings from John."

11:13.498 --> 11:16.197
You don't sound sure about that.

11:16.240 --> 11:18.329
No, I don't.

11:19.591 --> 11:21.506
The best thing
is for you

11:21.550 --> 11:24.161
to just forget
about this Veronica girl.

11:24.205 --> 11:25.423
Uh-huh.

11:25.467 --> 11:27.034
You should be playing the field,

11:27.077 --> 11:30.472
just like a bumblebee going
from flower to flower.

11:30.515 --> 11:32.082
Uh-huh.

11:32.126 --> 11:36.826
And don't get confused
about all this lovenonsense.

11:36.870 --> 11:39.786
Your freedom is
the only thing that matters.

11:39.829 --> 11:41.788
Uh-huh.

11:47.924 --> 11:50.622
Be a sweet boy
and get Meemaw a towel.

11:50.666 --> 11:52.146
Uh-huh.

11:59.588 --> 12:00.676
I need coffee.

12:00.720 --> 12:01.764
You needa shower.

12:05.594 --> 12:07.161
Missy, five minutes!

12:07.204 --> 12:09.337
Oh. Can you please?

12:09.380 --> 12:11.556
Oh. Sorry. Been there.

12:13.210 --> 12:16.518
She's hungover!
Wants us to keep it down!

12:23.830 --> 12:26.180
Are you going
for your baseball tryout?

12:26.223 --> 12:28.704
Yup.Will it include a written test?

12:28.748 --> 12:30.097
No.

12:30.140 --> 12:31.925
Well, just in case,
here are some baseball facts

12:31.968 --> 12:33.230
that may come in handy.

12:33.274 --> 12:35.058
It was invented in the 1830s.

12:35.102 --> 12:37.365
The first officially
recorded game was in 1846,

12:37.408 --> 12:39.889
and that game took place
in Hoboken, New Jersey.

12:39.933 --> 12:41.238
I won't need to know that.

12:41.282 --> 12:42.979
Well, now you do,
and you'll never forget it.

12:43.023 --> 12:44.372
Already gone.

12:47.418 --> 12:49.464
I'm starting to worry about you.

12:49.507 --> 12:52.119
I just had a little too much
to drink. So what?

12:52.162 --> 12:55.731
If you're upset about
Dr. Sturgis, that's okay.I'm not upset.

12:55.775 --> 12:57.385
I don't care.

12:57.428 --> 12:59.691
So you don't care
that I saw him last night?

12:59.735 --> 13:01.693
No. I hope he's great.

13:02.738 --> 13:03.913
Okay.

13:05.219 --> 13:06.873
Is he great?

13:06.916 --> 13:08.439
He seemed okay.

13:08.483 --> 13:09.789
Tell it to somebody who cares.

13:19.886 --> 13:22.062
Excuse me,
you Coach Ballard?

13:22.105 --> 13:23.237
That'd be me.

13:23.280 --> 13:24.368
George Cooper.

13:24.412 --> 13:26.196
My daughter's here to try out.

13:26.240 --> 13:27.719
Daughter?

13:27.763 --> 13:30.157
Well, you didn't mention that
on the phone.

13:30.200 --> 13:31.811
Oh, did I leave that out?

13:31.854 --> 13:33.421
Well, here she is.

13:33.464 --> 13:34.422
Hi.

13:34.465 --> 13:36.076
Uh-huh.

13:36.119 --> 13:37.555
You want to see
what she can do?

13:37.599 --> 13:40.167
I want to see her go home.

13:40.210 --> 13:41.559
Sorry?

13:41.603 --> 13:43.823
Come on, I'm not gonna put
a girl on the team.

13:43.866 --> 13:45.085
Why not?

13:45.128 --> 13:47.870
Why not? She's a girl.

13:47.914 --> 13:49.916
She's got pigtails.

13:49.959 --> 13:51.526
Missy, give us a minute.

13:51.569 --> 13:53.093
No, I want to hear.

13:53.136 --> 13:54.572
Look, sweetheart,

13:54.616 --> 13:57.532
I just think it's great
you want to be on the team,

13:57.575 --> 13:59.969
but these boys
are gonna eat you alive.

14:00.013 --> 14:01.188
I'm not afraid of them.

14:01.231 --> 14:03.146
Well, maybe you should be.

14:03.190 --> 14:05.496
At least let her throw a few.
She got a hell of an arm.

14:05.540 --> 14:08.282
George,
you're a football coach, right?Mm-hmm.

14:08.325 --> 14:10.110
You gonna put a girl
on yourteam?

14:10.153 --> 14:11.807
It's different.
It's a contact sport.

14:11.851 --> 14:13.940
So is this.
She gets up to bat,

14:13.983 --> 14:16.377
and someone deliberately
throws a ball at her,

14:16.420 --> 14:18.814
it's gonna make contact.

14:18.858 --> 14:21.164
You're not even
gonna give her a chance?

14:22.165 --> 14:23.863
No.

14:23.906 --> 14:26.213
Come on, let's get out of here.

14:29.781 --> 14:31.392
I'm sorry, honey.

14:31.435 --> 14:33.394
It's not your fault.

14:34.786 --> 14:36.223
Bye-bye.

14:39.661 --> 14:41.228
Can I help you?

14:41.271 --> 14:42.359
Yeah. I'm Georgie.

14:42.403 --> 14:43.795
I'm a friend
of Veronica's.

14:43.839 --> 14:45.145
I brought this for her.

14:45.188 --> 14:46.711
Oh, isn't that nice!

14:46.755 --> 14:48.452
My granddaughter's
at the doctor,

14:48.496 --> 14:50.019
but you're welcome to wait.

14:50.063 --> 14:51.151
Oh.

14:51.194 --> 14:52.979
Okay. Thanks.

14:54.023 --> 14:55.590
Oh, and this is me

14:55.633 --> 14:57.548
and my cousin Glen.

14:57.592 --> 14:59.159
No, no, wait.

14:59.202 --> 15:01.944
Is that Russell or Glen?

15:01.988 --> 15:04.381
No, I'm pretty sure
that's Glen.

15:04.425 --> 15:06.035
Uh-huh.

15:06.079 --> 15:07.645
Oh!

15:07.689 --> 15:10.170
By the way, don't send Georgie
to the store anymore

15:10.213 --> 15:11.345
to get you beer.

15:11.388 --> 15:12.912
He snitched on me?

15:12.955 --> 15:15.088
Well, he tried to steal one.

15:18.265 --> 15:19.701
What happened?

15:19.744 --> 15:21.703
She didn't make the team?

15:21.746 --> 15:24.358
She didn't even get to try out.Why not?

15:24.401 --> 15:26.229
Coach doesn't want a girl
on his team.

15:26.273 --> 15:27.883
And you were okay with that?

15:27.927 --> 15:29.189
No. I tried.

15:29.232 --> 15:31.191
There was no changing his mind.

15:31.234 --> 15:33.062
Where are you going?

15:33.106 --> 15:35.586
To be mad
at somebody new.

15:41.462 --> 15:43.246
Are you all right?

15:43.290 --> 15:44.552
Leave me alone.

15:44.595 --> 15:45.770
Was there a written test,

15:45.814 --> 15:47.207
and you couldn't remember
what I told you?

15:47.250 --> 15:48.469
No.

15:48.512 --> 15:50.645
You want to be
on that baseball team?

15:50.688 --> 15:52.516
Yes, but the coach said...I don't care

15:52.560 --> 15:54.475
what he said--
get your glove, let's go.

15:54.518 --> 15:56.129
Okay.

15:59.262 --> 16:00.350
Missy.

16:00.394 --> 16:01.395
What?

16:01.438 --> 16:03.179
Do good baseball.

16:07.967 --> 16:09.403
That's him.Hey.

16:09.446 --> 16:12.406
Hello. Can I
talk to you?Yeah.

16:12.449 --> 16:14.495
You tell my granddaughter
she can't play baseball?

16:15.800 --> 16:18.934
Oh, well, I was just
looking out for her, that's all.

16:18.978 --> 16:21.067
Is that so?Yes, ma'am, it is.

16:21.110 --> 16:23.895
Well, we don't need you deciding
what's best for her.

16:23.939 --> 16:26.028
Uh-huh. What doyou need?

16:26.072 --> 16:29.249
I need you to give her
the same chance you would a boy!

16:30.337 --> 16:31.686
Or what?

16:31.729 --> 16:33.427
Or you and me
gonna have problems.

16:35.995 --> 16:38.345
Well, we wouldn't want that,
would we?

16:38.388 --> 16:40.477
No, we wouldn't.

16:42.740 --> 16:45.091
Okay, let's see
what you got, kid.

16:45.134 --> 16:46.483
Here you go.

16:55.492 --> 16:57.103
Fire it in
there, baby.

16:57.146 --> 16:58.321
I'm scared.

16:58.365 --> 17:00.280
Meemaw has just
made a scene.

17:00.323 --> 17:02.891
Now is not the time
to be scared!

17:02.934 --> 17:04.284
Are we gonna do this today?

17:04.327 --> 17:05.981
Keep your pants on!

17:06.025 --> 17:07.896
Throw the damn ball.

17:15.251 --> 17:18.950
I'm just a girl, but I think
that's called a strike.

17:20.126 --> 17:21.649
Not bad.

17:23.346 --> 17:25.000
We're back.

17:25.044 --> 17:26.306
How'd it go?

17:26.349 --> 17:27.524
She made the team!

17:27.568 --> 17:29.831
Congratulations!

17:29.874 --> 17:32.138
And Meemaw got a
date with the coach.

17:32.181 --> 17:33.052
What?

17:34.140 --> 17:36.533
It was a productive afternoon.

17:42.757 --> 17:46.065
Back then, gas was
only 20 cents a gallon.

17:46.108 --> 17:47.327
Mm-hmm.

17:47.370 --> 17:49.720
Not that we had
anyplace worthwhile

17:49.764 --> 17:51.635
to drive to.

17:51.679 --> 17:54.160
Did you say Veronica
would be back soon?

17:54.203 --> 17:57.119
I'm sure it'll be
just any minute.

17:57.163 --> 18:01.080
Let me show you my collection
of antique bells.

18:08.565 --> 18:09.566
GEORGE JR.:
Please stop.
