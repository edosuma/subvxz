WEBVTT

00:41.663 --> 00:43.062
What?

00:43.165 --> 00:45.030
I can't hear you.

00:45.333 --> 00:47.666
Tell me there's no range
in this fucking place.

01:40.688 --> 01:42.280
Yeah, great.

01:42.390 --> 01:44.017
I really need it some way.

01:56.137 --> 01:57.626
Listen, Mike.

01:57.738 --> 01:59.764
I'm stopping in a city
five minutes from here

01:59.907 --> 02:02.205
so l can try and call you
back from a fixed phone line.

04:43.504 --> 04:44.766
Jack Stone.

04:44.906 --> 04:46.771
35 years old.

04:47.375 --> 04:49.240
Four of which spent in lraq.

04:51.244 --> 04:53.110
Medal of the Congress.

04:53.815 --> 04:56.442
An expert in
high-risk missions.

04:57.151 --> 04:59.209
A capable man in every aspect.

05:00.821 --> 05:02.721
So tell me, General.

05:03.090 --> 05:05.422
What on earth
makes you think this

05:05.760 --> 05:08.819
capable man will accept
a mission like this?

05:11.765 --> 05:13.757
In exchange for his freedom.

05:15.269 --> 05:18.899
Stone is currently detained
in a six-by-nine-foot cell

05:19.007 --> 05:20.974
where he's
serving a life sentence.

05:23.244 --> 05:24.524
What could a man in his position

05:24.579 --> 05:26.444
desire more than his freedom?

05:27.281 --> 05:29.272
And what's he been charged with?

05:29.784 --> 05:32.275
Treason and murder,
Mr. Secretary,

05:33.087 --> 05:35.579
but l'll spare you the details.

05:37.426 --> 05:40.121
A widower with a
seven-year-old daughter

05:40.194 --> 05:42.185
he hasn't seen
since he was detained.

05:43.464 --> 05:44.864
Still...

05:44.967 --> 05:48.801
a capable man with
great strategic skills

05:48.870 --> 05:50.667
a natural leader.

05:50.838 --> 05:53.932
But as l said...
a Mr. Nobody

05:54.041 --> 05:56.374
with no one
left waiting for him.

05:56.645 --> 05:59.273
No one apart from his daughter.

06:01.115 --> 06:03.982
Why do you think he
accepted the mission, sir?

06:07.221 --> 06:09.883
So you're absolutely sure

06:09.991 --> 06:11.481
that Stone will carry out
this mission

06:11.558 --> 06:13.652
without suspecting anything?

06:14.227 --> 06:15.560
Absolutely.

06:16.464 --> 06:18.159
I will personally
travel to Romania

06:18.232 --> 06:20.132
and follow the situation closely.

06:20.835 --> 06:23.132
The Romanian government
has already been informed.

06:24.037 --> 06:25.972
Everything will proceed
as planned.

06:29.477 --> 06:31.172
Rojznov is...

06:31.245 --> 06:33.576
nothing more than
a small dormitory town,

06:34.015 --> 06:35.242
with the power plant workers

06:35.348 --> 06:37.749
and theirfamilies
in the middle of nowhere.

06:37.852 --> 06:40.582
The explosion will erase any trace
of the laboratory

06:40.688 --> 06:41.746
in the building.

06:41.856 --> 06:43.687
But how can we be sure

06:43.758 --> 06:46.750
that Stone can carry out
this mission on his own?

06:46.861 --> 06:48.556
Well, that's simple.

06:48.663 --> 06:50.153
Because he won't be on his own.

06:56.170 --> 06:58.138
John "Mad Dog" McKellen...

06:59.874 --> 07:01.842
AKA, The Specialist,

07:03.009 --> 07:05.273
expert in
explosives and firearms.

07:06.781 --> 07:09.214
He could build a lethal weapon

07:09.282 --> 07:12.218
just with a glass
and a pencil sharpener.

07:13.520 --> 07:15.249
To Mr. McKellen, we owe
the explosion

07:15.355 --> 07:19.383
of the Congress Palace
of Johannesburg in 1997.

07:21.528 --> 07:23.553
More than 50 people died
in the bombing.

07:25.899 --> 07:27.731
Dragan llic...

07:28.569 --> 07:29.627
the sniper.

07:31.304 --> 07:32.737
They say during the Kosovo War,

07:32.806 --> 07:35.138
Mr. llic killed
more than 300 people

07:36.209 --> 07:38.905
without ever leaving his position, ever.

07:40.914 --> 07:44.077
He could shoot a mouse dead
from over a mile away.

07:59.400 --> 08:00.923
Eden Shizuka.

08:02.769 --> 08:04.896
Unbeatable in
hand-to-hand combat.

08:05.438 --> 08:06.836
Now, she will be indispensible

08:06.939 --> 08:08.771
should our men find themself

08:08.842 --> 08:11.504
in a difficult situation
and low on ammo.

08:12.780 --> 08:15.111
She learned how
to fight from some

08:15.447 --> 08:17.472
scatter brained monk in Japan

08:17.584 --> 08:19.061
where she'd moved from
Northern lreland

08:19.085 --> 08:21.419
with her mother...
But that's not important.

08:21.856 --> 08:23.256
So l guess
you're gonna tell me that

08:23.290 --> 08:24.518
they all have a daughter

08:24.625 --> 08:25.905
- waiting for them at home.
- No.

08:26.960 --> 08:28.519
I will tell you,

08:28.629 --> 08:30.620
they will each have $2 million

08:30.798 --> 08:32.663
waiting in their bank accounts.

08:33.366 --> 08:36.962
They are soldiers of fortune,
Mr. Secretary.

08:37.038 --> 08:38.470
Mercenaries.

08:38.606 --> 08:40.471
They would do
anything for money.

08:40.541 --> 08:41.600
So the money we offer them

08:41.708 --> 08:43.677
will help keeping
their mouth shut.

08:44.111 --> 08:47.079
At least until they
have left for the mission.

08:47.381 --> 08:50.509
How can we be sure that
there will be no survivors?

08:50.618 --> 08:52.051
There could be a family somewhere

08:52.153 --> 08:54.144
hidden away,
waiting to be rescued.

08:54.455 --> 08:56.184
With all due respect, sir,

08:56.290 --> 08:58.090
l would be more worried
should someone divulge

08:58.125 --> 09:00.184
what we did to that city.

09:00.327 --> 09:02.158
Theoretically, we should not
have been active

09:02.229 --> 09:04.129
in that part of Europe.

09:04.231 --> 09:07.893
I urge you to bear in mind
we are very short on time.

09:09.335 --> 09:11.167
We would not be able to sustain

09:11.304 --> 09:13.466
a possible virus propagation.

09:15.008 --> 09:16.532
Those... monsters

09:16.676 --> 09:18.405
could eventually
find a way to escape

09:18.511 --> 09:20.036
the security perimeter,

09:20.181 --> 09:21.841
and we don't have a cure.

09:21.916 --> 09:25.407
Not since our dear
Doc Neumann passed away.

09:25.853 --> 09:28.184
And there's no trace
of his daughter.

09:28.521 --> 09:30.683
Oh, yes, we
we did search for her,

09:30.758 --> 09:33.852
but, well, the situation
was already critical.

09:35.261 --> 09:37.855
But should we find
that she is still alive,

09:37.931 --> 09:39.762
then we will bring her in.

09:39.866 --> 09:41.857
You can be sure of that.

09:42.536 --> 09:44.503
Now is the time to act.

09:45.538 --> 09:47.871
The ground water
tables have been sealed

09:48.341 --> 09:50.970
and the toxicity of the cloud
has vanished.

09:52.179 --> 09:55.375
Rojznov has now
been quarantined.

09:55.448 --> 09:57.440
But those things are infected.

09:57.784 --> 09:59.376
One would be enough to infect

09:59.452 --> 10:01.421
the whole country in
a matter of hours,

10:01.522 --> 10:03.217
and in a few days, the world!

10:16.803 --> 10:18.430
May God forgive us all.

10:35.221 --> 10:36.654
Look at them run.

10:38.491 --> 10:39.719
Just like chickens.

10:41.593 --> 10:42.653
Uh-huh.

10:42.763 --> 10:44.491
Why run when,
just around the corner,

10:44.598 --> 10:47.930
someone is about to blow up
a nuclear power plant

10:48.101 --> 10:51.559
to exterminate the whole or
whatever them things are?

10:52.273 --> 10:54.399
In fact, they're like
a bunch of rabid dogs.

11:01.948 --> 11:03.939
- Do you know what, Dragan?
- Eh?

11:05.118 --> 11:09.110
This is turning out not to
be a picnic in the park.

11:09.288 --> 11:11.153
You're getting soft, my friend.

11:11.356 --> 11:12.688
Remember Laos?

11:12.792 --> 11:15.124
It's never gonna be
worse than that.

11:15.295 --> 11:17.159
Aye, l remember.

11:17.930 --> 11:21.196
But every time we seem to get
ourselves in bigger shit.

11:21.301 --> 11:23.031
C'est la vie, mon ami.

11:23.136 --> 11:24.968
Just think about big bucks.

11:25.606 --> 11:27.630
That should set up your
mind with ease.

11:27.775 --> 11:29.936
All soldiers
get ready for evacuation.

11:30.044 --> 11:31.476
Aye, l'll think about it.

11:31.544 --> 11:33.172
You know what?
What?

11:33.280 --> 11:34.645
This is my last gig.

11:36.851 --> 11:38.841
Let's just blow up
these shitheads,

11:39.553 --> 11:41.452
level this place.

11:42.555 --> 11:44.887
And then l can get my ass

11:46.160 --> 11:48.025
in a first-class seat...

11:49.329 --> 11:51.320
all the way to the mountains.

11:51.799 --> 11:54.461
I'm gonna open a restaurant
on the beach.

11:54.969 --> 11:56.061
You?

11:56.170 --> 11:57.865
I cannot picture you
wearing a bermuda,

11:58.004 --> 12:01.132
some flowery Hawaiian shirt.

12:01.241 --> 12:04.075
But you do like my haggis
and leeks, don't you?

12:04.177 --> 12:05.202
Hell no.

12:05.346 --> 12:07.074
The only thing your slop is good

12:07.181 --> 12:09.046
is for maneuvering the fields.

12:09.250 --> 12:10.341
Seriously.

12:10.416 --> 12:12.247
I'm no longer subject for your

12:12.352 --> 12:15.083
exotic culinary experiments.

12:15.189 --> 12:17.588
They always ended up
in a hurricane of shit.

12:19.192 --> 12:21.057
Do you know what?

12:21.594 --> 12:23.926
It's always with
a skinny-ass like you,

12:25.198 --> 12:26.757
as you didn't like eating.

12:26.866 --> 12:29.198
I'm so sorry to spoil
your self-glorification,

12:29.836 --> 12:31.360
but l love eating,

12:31.504 --> 12:34.132
as much as l care
what happens after.

12:34.374 --> 12:36.070
I don't like when
your "cookings"

12:36.210 --> 12:37.676
get from my mouth to my guts.

12:40.079 --> 12:41.774
It's some nasty shit,
believe me.

12:41.881 --> 12:43.280
You don't want to know.

12:43.382 --> 12:45.614
All personnel
prepare for evacuation.

12:45.719 --> 12:47.584
You're right.

12:47.854 --> 12:49.617
You're full of shit.

12:52.224 --> 12:53.556
Do you know there's a saying?

12:53.626 --> 12:55.115
No.

12:55.228 --> 12:57.220
If you do not like eating,

12:57.697 --> 13:00.029
then you probably
don't like fucking, either.

13:02.068 --> 13:03.591
Your mother never complained.

13:05.705 --> 13:08.333
And l'm pretty sure
it was something like,

13:08.541 --> 13:10.406
if you can't cook...

13:11.077 --> 13:12.077
you can't fuck.

13:13.312 --> 13:15.212
Well, my friend...

13:15.882 --> 13:16.974
l can cook.

13:17.083 --> 13:18.244
Yup.

13:18.318 --> 13:19.580
And l can lick my own balls.

13:19.652 --> 13:20.652
Really?

13:24.257 --> 13:25.655
What do you say, princess?

13:29.562 --> 13:30.893
Do you like cooking?

13:33.432 --> 13:36.094
L'd love to see you
in the kitchen,

13:36.503 --> 13:38.366
jumping from pot to pan,

13:39.772 --> 13:41.637
with nothing on...

13:42.174 --> 13:43.903
but a teeny-weeny apron.

13:48.614 --> 13:50.104
Save a bullet, will you?

13:50.183 --> 13:51.649
Give up, my friend.

13:51.750 --> 13:54.412
Women are never very
talkative people like us.

13:54.787 --> 13:57.688
Deep down, they know we can
show them paradise

13:57.790 --> 13:59.655
beneath the sheets,

14:00.026 --> 14:01.356
and they feel it in their guts.

14:06.098 --> 14:07.862
Give up?

14:07.967 --> 14:09.457
Me?

14:10.769 --> 14:12.101
Are you kidding?

14:12.305 --> 14:13.703
Right.

14:19.611 --> 14:20.977
What do you say, princess?

14:24.149 --> 14:26.014
How about you and me

14:27.120 --> 14:29.646
get something on together...

14:29.723 --> 14:31.053
between the sheets?

14:43.136 --> 14:45.969
All soldiers get ready
for evacuation.

14:51.412 --> 14:52.935
Who the hell is this guy?

14:57.650 --> 14:59.175
Good flight, Lieutenant?

15:04.857 --> 15:06.517
Let's not waste any more time.

15:19.772 --> 15:21.399
We let you in from here.

15:23.376 --> 15:24.570
You'll be escorted up to

15:24.677 --> 15:26.542
the security
containment perimeter.

15:27.013 --> 15:29.915
Once inside, you're on your own.

15:31.785 --> 15:33.274
Just the way l like it.

15:33.386 --> 15:36.048
The bomb will be
primed by our engineers.

15:36.188 --> 15:38.782
You will need to get as close
as possible to the reactor

15:38.890 --> 15:40.620
and get there
as quickly as you can.

15:42.628 --> 15:43.908
Why don't we
go in through there?

15:45.398 --> 15:46.864
It looks a damn sight
easier to me.

15:48.066 --> 15:49.761
It's too risky.

15:49.869 --> 15:51.700
That's the most populated area,

15:51.903 --> 15:55.101
hence the more likely to be polluted
with the infected.

15:55.241 --> 15:56.707
It gets better and better.

15:59.044 --> 16:00.740
Obviously,
the area you'll pass through

16:00.813 --> 16:03.145
should be considered safer,
but not safe,

16:03.716 --> 16:04.774
so watch your backs.

16:04.917 --> 16:06.850
Be on alert at all times.

16:08.753 --> 16:10.779
You'll take this side street,

16:10.890 --> 16:13.085
which leads directly to
the nuclear power plant.

16:15.927 --> 16:19.260
Should everything go as planned
once the bomb is placed,

16:19.831 --> 16:22.995
you'll have about an
hour to get back to this base.

16:23.102 --> 16:24.295
One hour?

16:24.436 --> 16:25.631
Bloody hell.

16:25.771 --> 16:27.738
And what happens if you're late?

16:27.939 --> 16:30.338
The school bus will
come and collect us?

16:30.442 --> 16:33.172
Here, you will find a helicopter
waiting to take you to

16:33.279 --> 16:35.143
a safe military depot.

16:35.947 --> 16:37.812
There you will be
held until the dust

16:37.916 --> 16:39.781
from the explosion is settled.

16:40.619 --> 16:42.485
Only at that point...

16:42.955 --> 16:45.082
will the mission be classed
as accomplished.

16:47.792 --> 16:50.192
The answer to your
question, Mr. llic...

16:51.463 --> 16:52.829
if you are late...

16:52.932 --> 16:54.091
you die.

16:55.535 --> 16:57.502
Considering the sum
we're paying you,

16:57.669 --> 16:59.330
a delay cannot be accepted.

17:01.206 --> 17:02.639
Oh, talking about money.

17:07.779 --> 17:11.044
As we agreed, one million now,

17:11.482 --> 17:13.714
the rest once the mission
is accomplished.

17:15.119 --> 17:16.119
Any questions?

17:17.321 --> 17:19.185
Very well.

17:19.391 --> 17:21.551
Mr. Stone, if you please.

17:34.006 --> 17:35.206
I hope at least you care about

17:35.341 --> 17:37.172
this mission, Lieutenant.

17:38.144 --> 17:41.112
Should the virus propagate,
it would be the end.

17:42.180 --> 17:43.410
You must move quickly,

17:43.517 --> 17:45.507
place the bomb and get out.

17:46.852 --> 17:49.752
It must be made to look
like a terrible accident.

17:53.859 --> 17:55.724
The power plant explodes,

17:56.162 --> 17:58.221
the Rojznov inhabitants die.

17:59.331 --> 18:01.925
Their country mourns their loss

18:02.033 --> 18:04.662
and the United States
share in their sorrow.

18:05.671 --> 18:07.605
Nobody will know any different.

18:08.874 --> 18:10.704
This is your mission.

18:11.710 --> 18:13.439
I'm sure you fully
comprehend the situation.

18:14.880 --> 18:17.041
I'm not here to comprehend
anything, General.

18:19.451 --> 18:21.351
I'm here for my daughter.

18:21.720 --> 18:23.551
Of course.

18:23.622 --> 18:25.090
You have my word,

18:25.191 --> 18:26.555
you will hug your daughter

18:26.626 --> 18:28.526
once the mission is accomplished.

18:28.894 --> 18:32.226
The case will be closed,
all files will be lost.

18:32.864 --> 18:34.184
You'll have
a new beginning, Jack.

18:36.901 --> 18:39.200
Don't try to pull
any smart moves.

18:39.704 --> 18:42.696
We will be watching your
every step via satellite.

18:44.577 --> 18:46.306
Accomplish the mission

18:47.046 --> 18:48.707
and you'll be a free man.

19:45.102 --> 19:46.934
This doesn't look good.

19:47.306 --> 19:48.795
What did you expect?

19:48.940 --> 19:50.305
Balloons and bouquets?

20:00.318 --> 20:02.183
Abandon all hope...

20:02.721 --> 20:04.483
ye who enters here.

20:26.677 --> 20:28.009
I still don't understand

20:28.079 --> 20:30.070
what l'm supposed
to be shooting.

20:30.414 --> 20:32.314
Are they people or what?

20:32.584 --> 20:34.313
Oh... come on, Dragan.

20:35.587 --> 20:37.317
Does it make
a difference anyway?

20:40.024 --> 20:41.424
Don't tell me you've...

20:41.527 --> 20:44.189
developed a conscience
since we last worked together.

20:45.097 --> 20:46.996
Just trying to make conversation,

20:47.365 --> 20:49.697
considering our
chief, and this one here,

20:49.769 --> 20:51.100
talking is going to be

20:51.170 --> 20:53.160
the hardest part of the mission.

20:53.538 --> 20:55.233
You talk enough
for everyone, Dragan.

20:55.373 --> 20:56.567
Say that again?

20:56.708 --> 20:57.986
If everything goes
according to plan,

20:58.010 --> 20:59.977
we won't have to shoot anybody.

21:00.346 --> 21:01.744
We go in, we drop the bomb,

21:01.846 --> 21:05.373
we get out
and forget about this place.

21:05.450 --> 21:07.350
What a bummer.

21:07.719 --> 21:09.584
Eh, Dragan?

21:09.721 --> 21:11.712
I bet you were looking forward

21:12.024 --> 21:14.685
to blowing the heads off
some poor, innocent

21:15.126 --> 21:17.026
women and children,

21:18.129 --> 21:19.927
like you guys do...

21:20.031 --> 21:22.022
in that shitty country of yours.

21:23.134 --> 21:24.692
Right?

21:24.769 --> 21:26.259
Why don't you go
and fuck yourself

21:26.371 --> 21:27.599
with a Viking helmet?

21:33.745 --> 21:35.212
So what brings you here, chief?

21:36.414 --> 21:38.279
No offense.

21:38.750 --> 21:40.581
But you do not
look like one of us.

21:42.387 --> 21:44.252
You look more like...

21:45.156 --> 21:47.146
one of those
Mr. Nice Guys

21:47.991 --> 21:50.586
that helps little old ladies
across the street.

21:51.830 --> 21:53.730
The only difference is...

21:54.265 --> 21:55.630
you got muscle.

21:55.733 --> 21:57.098
It has nothing to do with money

21:57.135 --> 21:58.615
if that's what you're asking,
soldier.

21:59.571 --> 22:01.402
Come on, man.

22:01.673 --> 22:03.641
We're all in this shit together.

22:04.575 --> 22:06.338
The least you can do

22:06.443 --> 22:09.504
is tell us what brought you
into this fucking mess.

22:09.614 --> 22:11.946
I was promised
a clear criminal record.

22:12.250 --> 22:13.979
I bring home the mission...

22:14.085 --> 22:15.848
and they cancel my conviction.

22:15.953 --> 22:17.147
Conviction for what?

22:17.255 --> 22:18.619
Stealing a candy?

22:18.689 --> 22:19.952
Leave him alone, Dragan.

22:21.960 --> 22:23.018
Come on, chief.

22:23.127 --> 22:24.992
What did you do?

22:25.263 --> 22:26.695
Everything is allowed in war.

22:26.798 --> 22:28.128
Well, almost.

22:28.198 --> 22:30.929
Let's share some secrets, huh?

22:31.035 --> 22:32.445
Want to know what was
the worst thing

22:32.469 --> 22:33.494
l did during a mission?

22:33.638 --> 22:36.607
Will you shut your big mouth?

22:37.107 --> 22:38.972
All right.

22:39.142 --> 22:40.142
Have a go.

22:40.210 --> 22:41.678
I jerked off on a goat.

22:41.813 --> 22:44.475
Jesus fucking Christ, Dragan.

22:44.982 --> 22:46.813
Do not swear.

24:02.392 --> 24:03.952
There's something wrong.

24:06.531 --> 24:08.021
You can hear a pin drop.

24:10.201 --> 24:12.259
McKellen, open the gate.

24:12.904 --> 24:14.372
And you two stay on board.

24:34.593 --> 24:36.422
Hey, what the hell he's doing?

24:54.078 --> 24:56.410
The first lesson
of the perfect bomber:

24:57.949 --> 25:01.782
always save the explosion
'til the very last.

25:01.852 --> 25:03.843
Come on, man, where is the fun?

25:03.954 --> 25:05.820
Would you cut the bullshit?

25:06.089 --> 25:07.649
We're sitting on
a prime nuclear weapon.

25:09.026 --> 25:10.358
It's best we get going, then.

25:32.382 --> 25:34.282
Carter, you remember me?

25:34.451 --> 25:35.971
I'm the president
of the United States.

25:37.321 --> 25:39.652
I'm on my farm here in Texas

25:39.891 --> 25:42.051
and instead of playing golf
or whatever,

25:42.159 --> 25:43.888
fucking some hookers,

25:43.994 --> 25:47.055
uh, l think about you,
and not in a good way.

25:47.164 --> 25:48.495
I hope everything is okay.

25:49.900 --> 25:51.765
Yes, Mr. President.

25:52.235 --> 25:54.134
Everything is going as planned.

25:54.504 --> 25:56.028
Any press around, whatever,

25:56.173 --> 25:58.835
l don't want another
CNN feature about me.

25:59.177 --> 26:01.235
And, Carter, don't
fuck it up again,

26:01.344 --> 26:02.675
as in Korea and Vietnam,

26:02.746 --> 26:04.407
almost in the Second World War.

26:04.514 --> 26:07.040
You remember your father
almost lost the whole war.

26:07.151 --> 26:09.015
No, sir.

26:09.319 --> 26:11.014
There won't be any problems.

26:11.088 --> 26:12.248
I assure you.

26:12.355 --> 26:14.219
Everything will go as planned.

26:14.524 --> 26:16.584
Okay, go back to your work,
just forget it.

26:16.694 --> 26:18.094
And maybe l just
push the red button

26:18.195 --> 26:19.560
and blow it all up.

26:19.663 --> 26:20.687
Bye.

26:25.335 --> 26:26.563
Dragan, get to position

26:26.703 --> 26:28.364
and keep your eye on everything.

26:28.505 --> 26:29.916
Don't shoot unless
absolutely necessary,

26:29.940 --> 26:30.940
and please...

26:32.209 --> 26:33.733
don't fuck it up.

26:33.877 --> 26:35.571
No worry, chief.

26:35.679 --> 26:37.738
This what l do for a living.

26:37.848 --> 26:39.713
And what might that be?

26:40.685 --> 26:42.448
Fucking things up?

27:07.578 --> 27:09.910
McKellen, you take
care of the bomb.

27:10.481 --> 27:11.721
Eden and l will patrol the area

27:11.748 --> 27:13.410
to make sure there's
no surprises.

27:13.484 --> 27:14.643
Come on.

27:14.751 --> 27:16.116
Let's get out of here ASAP.

27:16.219 --> 27:18.552
Just give me
five more minutes, chief,

27:19.157 --> 27:21.819
and we'll be strolling away
from this shithouse.

27:22.093 --> 27:24.083
Happy as a pig in shit.

27:24.494 --> 27:26.325
And rich.

27:26.429 --> 27:28.091
And filthy rich!

28:21.485 --> 28:23.452
What the fuck?

28:28.557 --> 28:30.458
Oh, shit.

28:30.560 --> 28:31.994
Shit.

28:32.062 --> 28:33.062
Shit!

28:33.163 --> 28:34.391
Chief!

28:41.338 --> 28:42.532
John?

28:44.841 --> 28:46.706
I don't believe it.

28:47.176 --> 28:49.838
I'm gonna kill that
son of a bitch.

28:49.912 --> 28:52.404
You want to tell me what
the fuck's going on?

28:52.515 --> 28:54.176
We're screwed.

28:54.251 --> 28:55.912
We are royally screwed.

28:56.019 --> 28:57.747
That's what's going on.

28:57.854 --> 28:58.854
Take a look at this.

29:02.826 --> 29:04.691
Jesus.

29:05.195 --> 29:06.856
Can't you do
anything about this?

29:06.930 --> 29:09.524
Not only is it welded
to the chassis,

29:09.598 --> 29:12.067
but the primer is
deep inside the engine

29:12.202 --> 29:14.500
and that's linked direct
into the timer.

29:15.704 --> 29:17.569
Any interference by me...

29:19.109 --> 29:22.078
and l could slow,
if not stop the program.

29:23.612 --> 29:25.580
Even to look at this thing...

29:25.682 --> 29:27.114
could cause a problem.

29:27.216 --> 29:28.376
Hey!

29:28.450 --> 29:30.281
What are you waiting?

29:30.386 --> 29:32.514
Eden...
check the area.

29:34.023 --> 29:35.200
John, if we can't use this car,

29:35.224 --> 29:36.335
then we need to find a vehicle

29:36.359 --> 29:37.916
in order to get out of here.

29:38.027 --> 29:40.757
Let's check these warehouses
and see what we can find.

29:40.863 --> 29:43.390
Let's get back to Carter
to show him in full detail

29:43.467 --> 29:45.264
with whom he just tried to fuck.

29:52.375 --> 29:54.138
General, they're in.

29:54.244 --> 29:56.235
Do they have the situation
under control?

29:56.313 --> 29:57.803
Not exactly, sir.

29:57.914 --> 29:59.643
Look.

29:59.749 --> 30:01.808
Sir, l think we should
send a message...

30:01.918 --> 30:05.082
Don't waste your
energy thinking, Private.

30:06.656 --> 30:08.988
This mission is a success.

30:10.093 --> 30:12.425
Those monsters will just
make things easier.

30:13.097 --> 30:14.962
Pack everything up.

30:15.165 --> 30:16.462
We're leaving.

30:16.567 --> 30:17.567
Yes, sir.

30:30.280 --> 30:32.145
Stone, McKellen...

30:32.581 --> 30:34.243
20 incoming, 3:00!

31:11.321 --> 31:12.549
Come on, come on...

31:26.336 --> 31:27.336
Come on...

33:53.950 --> 33:55.940
steady, chief.

33:56.653 --> 33:58.518
There are more of them coming.

33:58.621 --> 33:59.883
How much ammo you got?

34:02.991 --> 34:05.222
I got about 12 cartridges
for this piece of shit.

34:05.328 --> 34:06.851
That's better than nothing.

34:06.962 --> 34:10.056
Dragan!

34:10.132 --> 34:11.464
Move it, we're out of here.

34:16.572 --> 34:18.472
Oh, shit, Jack.

34:18.741 --> 34:20.003
Look!

34:24.581 --> 34:25.808
What are you looking at?

34:27.181 --> 34:28.308
Come on.

34:29.752 --> 34:31.583
Decide who's gonna put
a bullet in my head.

34:34.856 --> 34:36.152
L'll do it myself.

34:38.527 --> 34:41.518
I don't want to hurt
your chances of meeting...

34:42.531 --> 34:43.862
my Lord.

34:45.167 --> 34:46.496
Don't make me beg.

34:48.202 --> 34:49.328
Do it now.

34:56.011 --> 34:57.205
My brother.

35:04.186 --> 35:05.675
So many wars.

35:08.056 --> 35:09.545
So many women.

35:12.861 --> 35:14.385
We will fight again.

35:15.964 --> 35:17.931
We will fight...

35:21.803 --> 35:23.361
Forgive me, my brother.

35:25.307 --> 35:26.637
Forgive me.

35:30.411 --> 35:31.710
We will meet again.

35:47.095 --> 35:48.995
John, let's move out.

35:50.299 --> 35:52.131
John!

35:52.268 --> 35:53.565
We're not gonna die here today.

35:55.238 --> 35:56.518
At least not before Carter does.

35:59.341 --> 36:02.140
If we're gonna make it to base
before the bomb blows up,

36:02.245 --> 36:03.805
we're gonna have to
go through the city.

36:27.035 --> 36:28.469
We're gonna die
in that city, chief.

36:29.971 --> 36:31.097
And we both know it.

36:33.309 --> 36:35.277
We have to get a vehicle.

36:35.877 --> 36:37.288
It's the only chance we've
got to get back

36:37.312 --> 36:39.090
to the military base
and get the hell out of here

36:39.114 --> 36:40.808
before the shit really
hits the fan.

36:42.651 --> 36:45.176
Granted, that is if
we have a working helicopter

36:45.287 --> 36:47.152
when we get there.

36:47.489 --> 36:49.249
I seriously doubt Carter
hasn't thought about

36:49.291 --> 36:51.315
every single
possible escape route.

36:53.295 --> 36:54.887
Aye.

36:54.996 --> 36:58.022
And l swear, if l come
across the son of a bitch,

36:58.134 --> 37:00.693
he's gonna have a close
and deep encounter

37:00.836 --> 37:01.859
with my knife.

37:10.345 --> 37:12.312
Sir, you should see this.

37:17.319 --> 37:18.411
You're a dreamer, Stone.

37:21.590 --> 37:22.681
Sir?

37:24.025 --> 37:25.424
What is it, Private?

37:25.527 --> 37:27.256
We just received
a call from the runway.

37:27.362 --> 37:30.195
There's a technical problem
with the blades of our helicopter.

37:30.298 --> 37:32.629
The mechanic has
already left the base.

37:32.934 --> 37:34.732
Damned idiots!

37:34.871 --> 37:36.064
Sir, l alerted the pilot

37:36.204 --> 37:37.444
and he's already working on it.

37:38.006 --> 37:40.200
He says he can fix it,
he just needs a little time.

37:40.274 --> 37:41.375
Time?

37:41.376 --> 37:44.278
That's exactly what we don't have,
you stupid fool.

37:44.380 --> 37:46.460
Do you want us to end up
like those things out there?

37:46.548 --> 37:47.606
No, sir, but l thought

37:47.716 --> 37:49.274
Then save your excuses

37:49.384 --> 37:51.249
and get the helicopter fixed,

37:51.353 --> 37:53.252
unless you want to
face a court martial.

37:53.354 --> 37:54.379
Yes, sir.

38:06.735 --> 38:08.032
It's a wee bit classy...

38:10.871 --> 38:12.736
but l think it'll do.

38:13.141 --> 38:15.041
Of course...

38:15.410 --> 38:17.037
providing the owner's
all right with it.

38:19.247 --> 38:20.577
Well, if that guy's the owner,

38:20.648 --> 38:22.138
l think he'll be just
fine about it.

38:22.249 --> 38:23.273
Son of a...

38:24.919 --> 38:28.083
Princess, you do talk.

38:28.155 --> 38:30.919
The wise only speak
when it's time to speak.

38:30.991 --> 38:32.754
The fool never shuts his
goddamn sewage hole.

38:35.430 --> 38:36.590
Oh, fuck you.

38:38.233 --> 38:39.927
Do you know what?

38:40.068 --> 38:42.228
My lips get a little bit loose,

38:42.336 --> 38:43.928
especially when l'm nervous.

38:44.071 --> 38:47.303
You must have a very bad case
of chronic nervousness.

38:47.408 --> 38:48.808
All right, kids,
shut up and get in,

38:48.844 --> 38:50.140
we're running out of time.

38:50.244 --> 38:51.610
L'll drive.

38:58.421 --> 38:59.853
If we just get out of the city,

38:59.955 --> 39:01.184
we might just have a chance.

39:03.592 --> 39:06.460
And how many of those
ugly bastards

39:06.528 --> 39:07.860
do you think there are out there

39:07.964 --> 39:09.124
just waiting for us?

39:10.766 --> 39:13.757
There's a lot more of those
than we have ammo for, John.

39:15.469 --> 39:17.335
I like your optimism, chief.

39:17.973 --> 39:18.997
They don't call me

39:19.140 --> 39:20.607
Mr. Fucking Sunshine
for nothing.

39:21.943 --> 39:23.808
These don't need ammo.

39:24.145 --> 39:25.442
See?

39:27.049 --> 39:28.949
No problem.

40:31.780 --> 40:33.246
Jesus, chief.

40:33.348 --> 40:34.542
This is getting serious.

40:37.618 --> 40:39.450
Hey, Scotty.

40:39.554 --> 40:40.680
A gift for you.

40:43.791 --> 40:45.520
And what am l supposed
to do with this?

41:09.750 --> 41:12.412
Luckiest son of a bitches
l've ever seen.

41:12.821 --> 41:14.082
It's no wonder this government

41:14.154 --> 41:16.145
wants to blow this shithole up.

41:16.991 --> 41:19.825
Going any further without
weapons or ammo is suicide.

41:19.928 --> 41:21.539
Another run-in with a bunch
of those wild creatures

41:21.563 --> 41:22.655
and we're gonna be joining

41:22.763 --> 41:23.991
their fucked-up family.

41:24.098 --> 41:26.896
And where are we gonna
find any ammo around here?

41:28.235 --> 41:30.204
L've got a funny feeling, chief.

41:30.938 --> 41:33.908
A local gun store,
if there ever was one,

41:34.074 --> 41:36.008
is not gonna be open today.

41:36.110 --> 41:37.110
Bingo.

41:40.115 --> 41:41.308
Okay, chief.

41:41.448 --> 41:42.541
Watch where you're driving.

41:55.029 --> 41:56.029
Get inside!

41:58.099 --> 41:59.395
Chief!

42:16.217 --> 42:17.808
Who took the smile off his face?

42:21.489 --> 42:23.150
That's definitely not a rat.

42:24.559 --> 42:25.635
We've got you covered, chief.

42:25.659 --> 42:26.888
Go get the ammo.

42:43.678 --> 42:44.735
Come on, baby.

42:46.181 --> 42:48.512
Where have you been all my life?

42:58.192 --> 42:59.524
For fuck's sake!

43:19.514 --> 43:21.377
Christ...

43:28.455 --> 43:29.455
Die!

44:28.581 --> 44:29.810
Who are you?

44:29.917 --> 44:32.248
Open the cell and l'll tell you.

44:32.853 --> 44:34.844
I'm not gonna ask you twice.

44:34.955 --> 44:37.617
Then we're in a stall,
don't you think?

44:37.758 --> 44:39.623
I'm not saying anything

44:39.793 --> 44:41.657
unless you free me first.

44:42.296 --> 44:43.489
Listen, lady.

44:43.629 --> 44:44.789
In just a little while,

44:44.897 --> 44:46.763
this place is gonna be
like the 4th of July

44:46.867 --> 44:47.867
and that cell is gonna be

44:47.968 --> 44:49.936
the last place you wanna be.

44:50.037 --> 44:51.937
So for the last time...

44:52.138 --> 44:53.138
who are you?

44:53.272 --> 44:54.432
You know what?

44:54.507 --> 44:55.805
Fuck you!

44:55.876 --> 44:58.140
You men are always
all and now, aren't you?

45:01.549 --> 45:03.449
My name is Samantha Neumann.

45:04.551 --> 45:05.551
Doc Neumann's daughter?

45:07.322 --> 45:10.552
Although l doubt you even
know who l'm talking about.

45:10.657 --> 45:14.286
Dr. Herbert Neumann,
toxicologist, immunologist.

45:15.162 --> 45:16.686
Surgeon leader for Project "K"

45:16.798 --> 45:18.628
for the US Army.

45:19.366 --> 45:21.266
Another brilliant mind

45:21.468 --> 45:23.163
in the bacteriological warfare.

45:23.303 --> 45:25.271
My father is not a murderer.

45:25.472 --> 45:27.167
Really?

45:27.241 --> 45:28.902
Jesus Christ.

45:29.009 --> 45:30.977
Okay, are you
letting me out or not?

45:35.415 --> 45:37.247
Hey!

45:37.352 --> 45:38.682
Hey, where are you going?

45:39.988 --> 45:41.011
Asshole!

45:43.590 --> 45:44.852
I knew it.

45:51.832 --> 45:53.060
A "thank you" would be nice.

45:54.268 --> 45:55.394
Thank you.

45:55.535 --> 45:56.728
Daddy.

45:58.273 --> 46:00.331
Now if you'd be so kind
as to introduce yourself

46:00.440 --> 46:02.271
and telling me what the hell
is going on here.

46:04.011 --> 46:05.376
Whoa!

46:09.950 --> 46:11.212
Nice catch, chief.

46:20.560 --> 46:22.118
Hello?

46:22.229 --> 46:24.822
Is anybody gonna bother explaining
to me what's up?

46:30.470 --> 46:33.234
It's a pretty straightforward
fucked-up situation, babe.

46:34.741 --> 46:37.732
Either we get ourselves
300 miles away from here

46:38.245 --> 46:39.269
or we're gonna look like

46:39.380 --> 46:40.744
those people from Hiroshima.

46:42.416 --> 46:43.781
No offense.

46:43.883 --> 46:45.060
We'll explain it to you later.

46:45.084 --> 46:46.918
Right now, there's no time.

46:46.919 --> 46:48.649
Let's move.

46:48.755 --> 46:50.279
Not a good idea, chief.

46:59.766 --> 47:01.597
Call the secretary, now!

47:02.268 --> 47:03.736
Yes, sir, right away, sir!

47:20.287 --> 47:21.727
Ah, we're running
out of time, chief.

47:21.788 --> 47:22.948
You're right.

47:23.023 --> 47:24.353
Let's get busy.

47:24.457 --> 47:25.856
Can you shoot?

47:25.958 --> 47:27.619
I'm a fast learner.

47:27.693 --> 47:29.184
What?

47:29.296 --> 47:30.296
Come on.

47:30.364 --> 47:31.955
Oh, fuck.

47:32.064 --> 47:33.929
This is my favorite gun.

47:34.201 --> 47:35.428
Let's go.

47:37.303 --> 47:38.303
Come on, princess.

47:47.480 --> 47:48.640
Okay.

47:48.714 --> 47:50.375
Pay attention.

47:50.484 --> 47:52.041
Check the mag,
make sure you're loaded.

47:52.151 --> 47:53.675
Click it back into place.

47:53.786 --> 47:55.651
Check the barrel,
you got one loaded,

47:55.721 --> 47:56.813
safety's off.

47:56.889 --> 47:58.789
Point, you're ready to fire.

47:58.957 --> 48:00.823
Don't hit the convertible.

48:00.960 --> 48:01.960
L'll be careful.

48:07.167 --> 48:08.998
Why were you in there?

48:09.136 --> 48:10.194
A brawl.

48:10.337 --> 48:12.202
In a bar.

48:12.339 --> 48:13.465
You?

48:13.574 --> 48:14.574
In a brawl?

48:17.309 --> 48:18.743
What's so funny?

48:18.845 --> 48:21.075
Nothing, ljust can't see you
in a brawl or a bar.

48:21.182 --> 48:22.978
Yeah, well, that's
'cause you don't know me.

48:30.656 --> 48:31.818
I'm Jack Stone.

48:38.065 --> 48:39.156
You're wounded.

48:39.265 --> 48:40.265
Hang on.

48:40.366 --> 48:41.494
Let me look at this.

48:44.204 --> 48:45.933
Jack.

48:46.038 --> 48:48.006
A regular name
for a regular guy.

48:49.542 --> 48:51.382
You sure don't look like
a regular guy, though.

48:53.380 --> 48:54.740
You don't look like
a regular girl.

48:55.882 --> 48:57.213
L'll take that as a compliment.

49:00.186 --> 49:02.712
Would you mind telling me
what's going on, Jack?

49:04.224 --> 49:06.089
Sure.

49:06.292 --> 49:08.557
The government wants to
nuke this whole place.

49:08.628 --> 49:10.925
So we brought in an atomic bomb,

49:11.030 --> 49:12.362
put it in
the nuclear power plant

49:12.432 --> 49:14.525
and it's gonna go off in
about 30 minutes.

49:14.634 --> 49:16.101
You what?

49:16.203 --> 49:17.280
It's the only way
they could be sure that

49:17.304 --> 49:18.931
the virus wouldn't propagate.

49:19.072 --> 49:20.936
It's not a virus.

49:21.407 --> 49:23.376
Come again?
It's not a virus.

49:25.411 --> 49:27.812
It's a cytotoxic toxin

49:27.913 --> 49:30.746
secreted by
a "microbiotic" organism

49:30.816 --> 49:32.648
synthesized in a lab.

49:35.087 --> 49:37.749
My dad is the leader
of the operation.

49:38.258 --> 49:39.485
His studies in immunology

49:39.592 --> 49:41.253
had drawn
the attention of the army,

49:41.327 --> 49:43.228
who has funded his research

49:43.762 --> 49:45.890
with millions of dollars.

49:46.565 --> 49:49.534
The problem is, my father
wanted to save lives

49:49.835 --> 49:51.355
while they just
wanted to destroy them.

50:26.373 --> 50:27.930
Anything to report, Doctor?

50:30.876 --> 50:32.309
I'm afraid nothing good,
General.

50:33.779 --> 50:35.508
We succeeded in
controlling the toxin,

50:35.614 --> 50:37.013
but the specimens are showing

50:37.116 --> 50:38.879
an uncontrollable aggressiveness.

50:43.656 --> 50:45.647
We're experiencing an
irreparable side effect.

50:46.492 --> 50:48.551
The toxin somehow acts on
the cerebral tissues,

50:48.661 --> 50:50.356
destroying any
ability of the specimen

50:50.462 --> 50:52.793
to keep the control over
its own aggression.

50:52.864 --> 50:54.628
It basically acts on
the nervous connectors,

50:54.733 --> 50:56.701
enhancing ferocity at
an exponential level.

50:58.337 --> 51:00.999
Try putting a steroid rat
into this cage

51:01.406 --> 51:02.738
and in a manner of seconds,

51:02.841 --> 51:04.832
nothing will be left of it.

51:04.910 --> 51:07.243
These other animals are afraid
of this infected specimen,

51:07.347 --> 51:08.871
so l must keep it covered.

51:08.982 --> 51:10.574
Not to mention the...

51:10.684 --> 51:12.549
postmortem physical degeneration.

51:13.018 --> 51:14.883
Explain, Doctor.

51:15.522 --> 51:17.387
Well...

51:17.991 --> 51:20.652
the toxin kills every
organism at a touch

51:21.194 --> 51:22.752
and at our
current stage of research,

51:22.862 --> 51:24.640
our experimental specimens
are nothing more than

51:24.664 --> 51:26.529
walking dead bodies.

51:26.700 --> 51:28.065
Very good, Doctor.

51:28.201 --> 51:29.896
Very good indeed.

51:30.036 --> 51:31.731
Did you not hear what
l just said, General?

51:31.870 --> 51:33.395
Of course l did.

51:33.540 --> 51:35.404
But people die in wars,

51:35.541 --> 51:37.407
or did you forget that?

51:37.711 --> 51:39.440
Thanks to your discoveries,
Doctor,

51:39.546 --> 51:42.537
we can now say we're
working ahead of schedule.

51:42.881 --> 51:44.873
And this way, we can avoid
the boring procedure

51:44.950 --> 51:47.283
of notifying
the families of the deceased,

51:47.454 --> 51:49.115
am l right?

51:49.222 --> 51:51.212
I'm impressed
by your work, Doctor.

51:51.957 --> 51:53.948
You most certainly are our man.

51:55.194 --> 51:57.755
But now the time has
come to take your research

51:57.864 --> 51:59.695
to the next level.

51:59.766 --> 52:00.823
Soldiers.

52:07.240 --> 52:09.265
What the hell do you think
you're doing, Carter?

52:09.408 --> 52:10.933
The infection rate
is extremely high,

52:11.044 --> 52:12.135
and don't forget,

52:12.244 --> 52:13.555
we haven't succeeded
in controlling

52:13.579 --> 52:15.569
the cytotoxin's
reaction to oxygen yet.

52:16.481 --> 52:18.474
Do you have any idea
what would happen

52:18.585 --> 52:21.486
if the substance comes
into contact with the air?

52:21.588 --> 52:22.645
The slightest inattention

52:22.755 --> 52:24.484
and the infection would spread.

52:24.590 --> 52:27.151
Are you out of your mind?
Watch your tongue, Doctor.

52:27.260 --> 52:28.920
Surely you didn't
believe the millions

52:28.994 --> 52:30.986
our government invested
into your research

52:31.196 --> 52:33.061
were unsecured, did you?

52:33.365 --> 52:35.628
We want results, Neumann,

52:35.768 --> 52:38.169
and you seem
ready to give us some.

52:38.838 --> 52:41.602
Now... proceed.

53:03.462 --> 53:05.326
Carter, for God's sake.

53:06.865 --> 53:08.332
God?

53:08.435 --> 53:10.265
Don't be stupid, Doctor.

53:10.869 --> 53:12.769
God didn't create any of this.

53:14.038 --> 53:15.699
You did.

53:20.713 --> 53:22.340
What are you going to do?

53:22.448 --> 53:23.709
I don't know, Sam.

53:23.816 --> 53:25.373
I just don't know.

53:25.483 --> 53:27.645
All l know is that l must
put an end to this madness.

53:28.887 --> 53:30.087
I cannot allow that man to use

53:30.122 --> 53:31.714
my research the way he wants to.

53:31.824 --> 53:32.984
I just can't.

53:33.058 --> 53:34.957
Yeah, but how, Dad?

53:36.495 --> 53:37.688
It's dangerous.

53:37.795 --> 53:39.127
Listen, Sam.

53:39.199 --> 53:40.975
Get on the first plane out of here,
just leave the country,

53:40.999 --> 53:42.296
go back to the States,

53:42.401 --> 53:43.867
to your mum's But, Dad

53:43.969 --> 53:45.027
You don't understand, Sam.

53:45.170 --> 53:46.295
It's my fault.

53:47.572 --> 53:49.039
It's my fault,

53:49.174 --> 53:51.052
and l'm the only one that
can do something about it.

53:51.076 --> 53:53.407
I have to do something about it.

53:53.511 --> 53:56.207
I need you to get as far
away from here as possible.

53:56.314 --> 53:58.077
It's not safe here anymore.

53:58.182 --> 54:00.014
That madman is
liable to do anything.

54:01.420 --> 54:02.682
Just leave, please!

54:03.988 --> 54:05.080
And don't try

54:05.190 --> 54:07.181
and contact me for any reason.

54:07.859 --> 54:08.859
L'll stay in touch.

54:08.926 --> 54:10.088
Okay.

54:11.663 --> 54:12.961
Okay.

54:14.333 --> 54:15.413
I know l can't say antyhing

54:15.534 --> 54:16.578
to make you change your mind.

54:16.602 --> 54:19.571
Just... promise me

54:19.705 --> 54:20.934
you'Il be careful.

54:23.008 --> 54:24.408
I promise.

54:35.621 --> 54:38.249
My father tried to stop
the research at any cost.

54:39.557 --> 54:40.958
But it was already too late.

54:42.561 --> 54:44.392
He'd created what they wanted.

54:44.697 --> 54:46.027
A deadly weapon.

54:48.232 --> 54:50.132
So he secretly synthesized
a vaccine,

54:50.234 --> 54:52.066
certain that, sooner or later,

54:52.137 --> 54:53.729
it would have been indispensable.

55:51.162 --> 55:52.926
So thanks to your father,

55:52.998 --> 55:54.198
that bite mark didn't turn you

55:54.266 --> 55:55.995
into one of those things.

55:56.134 --> 55:57.829
He injected me with a vaccine

55:57.970 --> 55:59.170
when he realized how dangerous

55:59.203 --> 56:00.432
what he was doing was.

56:02.473 --> 56:04.374
I know he's got a solution

56:04.476 --> 56:06.341
for what's happening here, too.

56:07.446 --> 56:09.346
My father can stop all this.

56:09.447 --> 56:10.959
He's probably working
at it this very moment.

56:10.983 --> 56:12.848
Sam.
Believe me, Jack.

56:13.151 --> 56:14.812
He can stop it all.
Sam.

56:17.956 --> 56:19.013
Yourfather's dead.

56:20.491 --> 56:21.719
He killed himself.

56:22.994 --> 56:24.860
It was in the file
General Carter gave me.

56:24.963 --> 56:26.190
Freeze!

56:28.165 --> 56:29.792
Drop the gun!

56:29.901 --> 56:31.801
You don't understand.

56:32.068 --> 56:33.195
I have to do this.

56:49.020 --> 56:50.631
He probably couldn't accept
the responsibility

56:50.655 --> 56:52.020
for what he caused.

56:54.593 --> 56:55.752
I'm sorry.

56:56.861 --> 56:57.885
Chief!

56:57.995 --> 56:59.155
L've got a good idea!

56:59.230 --> 57:00.663
What's the plan?

57:00.765 --> 57:02.209
You know what
a pile of shite looks like

57:02.233 --> 57:03.233
with flies around it?

57:04.770 --> 57:06.670
I'm gonna create
a big pile of shite.

57:08.205 --> 57:09.845
You're gonna have to
trust me on this one.

57:21.553 --> 57:22.712
Go!

57:39.204 --> 57:40.569
Have you got any aspirin, chief?

57:40.639 --> 57:41.749
I think they're gonna need it.

57:41.773 --> 57:42.773
Sam.

57:42.873 --> 57:44.067
Are you all right?

57:45.744 --> 57:47.609
I think so.

57:47.913 --> 57:49.777
You did good back there.

57:50.082 --> 57:51.605
We're gonna make it, you'll see.

57:51.716 --> 57:52.740
Are you wounded?

57:52.818 --> 57:53.818
No, l'm okay.

57:53.919 --> 57:55.283
It's just a scratch.

57:55.386 --> 57:57.378
If you don't mind me interrupting

57:57.756 --> 57:59.621
you two lovebirds,

58:00.224 --> 58:01.556
l think we've got a wee problem.

58:18.944 --> 58:20.467
What do you think?

58:20.578 --> 58:21.671
Aye.

58:21.780 --> 58:23.337
Of course l can do it.

58:23.447 --> 58:25.005
But you need to
give me some time.

58:25.116 --> 58:27.277
John, time is one thing
we do not have.

58:27.351 --> 58:29.445
Two minutes, that's all
l need is two minutes.

58:46.805 --> 58:48.271
What brought you here?

58:48.372 --> 58:50.272
It's a long story.

58:50.609 --> 58:53.133
I bet you don't
have time to tell me, right?

58:53.210 --> 58:54.930
I don't think you want to
know why l'm here.

58:54.979 --> 58:56.969
If l didn't want to know...

58:57.482 --> 58:58.642
l wouldn't have asked.

59:03.621 --> 59:04.781
It's about her.

59:06.723 --> 59:08.124
It's all for her.

59:09.393 --> 59:11.293
You saved my life.

59:13.264 --> 59:14.458
I'm good with it.

59:25.676 --> 59:27.166
Incoming!

59:29.513 --> 59:30.825
John, my friend,
whatever you're doing,

59:30.849 --> 59:31.906
do it fast!

59:35.319 --> 59:36.843
Will ya slow down, chief?

59:36.921 --> 59:37.921
I'm getting old.

59:52.203 --> 59:53.602
Time's up, John!

59:53.703 --> 59:54.727
Everyone in the car!

01:00:06.550 --> 01:00:07.846
Fuck!
Oh, shit!

01:00:07.917 --> 01:00:09.010
Everybody out!

01:00:09.086 --> 01:00:10.086
Now!

01:00:26.237 --> 01:00:27.705
No!

01:00:39.483 --> 01:00:41.918
No, no, no!

01:01:07.111 --> 01:01:08.408
Jack... Jack!

01:01:10.114 --> 01:01:12.015
I can't hold them off
for long, guys!

01:01:12.117 --> 01:01:13.584
Eden, come on!

01:01:23.761 --> 01:01:25.286
If we don't stop for gas soon,

01:01:25.396 --> 01:01:27.591
we're gonna run out
and we'll be on foot.

01:01:29.934 --> 01:01:31.163
Jack, there!

01:01:31.303 --> 01:01:32.496
Ah, so easy.

01:01:57.194 --> 01:01:58.957
Sam, get out
and fill up the tank!

01:01:59.029 --> 01:02:00.155
John, help me push!

01:02:19.482 --> 01:02:20.710
Zombies!

01:02:27.658 --> 01:02:28.682
Shit!

01:02:30.026 --> 01:02:31.220
Get back, Sam.

01:02:40.037 --> 01:02:41.435
Grab the dog and follow me!

01:02:44.008 --> 01:02:45.270
Shit!

01:02:45.376 --> 01:02:46.843
Come on, get inside!

01:02:58.121 --> 01:02:59.918
So who the fuck are y'all?

01:03:00.023 --> 01:03:02.218
I said who the fuck are y'all?

01:03:07.064 --> 01:03:08.224
You got a problem?

01:03:08.364 --> 01:03:10.195
It's nothing l can't fix.

01:03:12.235 --> 01:03:13.463
Don't play with him.

01:03:13.568 --> 01:03:15.434
Come on, it's okay.

01:03:15.739 --> 01:03:17.433
I'm Jack Stone.

01:03:17.541 --> 01:03:18.939
This is Eden.

01:03:19.042 --> 01:03:20.477
This is Sam.

01:03:20.577 --> 01:03:22.545
This irresistible bastard
is Mad Dog.

01:03:24.482 --> 01:03:26.143
What about you?

01:03:26.251 --> 01:03:27.445
You don't exactly look like

01:03:27.551 --> 01:03:28.984
a Romanian factory worker to me.

01:03:29.087 --> 01:03:30.144
Doug.

01:03:30.254 --> 01:03:32.313
Doug Mulligan, entrepreneur.

01:03:33.390 --> 01:03:34.949
Shit.

01:03:35.060 --> 01:03:38.028
We was on vacation 'til
those freaks turned up.

01:03:38.862 --> 01:03:40.407
And, hell, we was
having a good time, too,

01:03:40.431 --> 01:03:42.262
weren't we, sugar pie?

01:03:42.499 --> 01:03:43.710
This here is Claire, by the way,

01:03:43.734 --> 01:03:45.600
and the dog's lndiana.

01:03:45.903 --> 01:03:47.803
She don't talk a whole bunch,

01:03:47.905 --> 01:03:50.396
but believe me, she got many fine
hidden qualities.

01:03:54.945 --> 01:03:56.937
Don't take it personally,
big fella.

01:03:58.082 --> 01:04:00.448
She's been the silent type
since her psycho brother

01:04:00.517 --> 01:04:02.849
killed her entire
family with a hammer.

01:04:03.087 --> 01:04:04.952
Ma, Pa, little brother.

01:04:05.289 --> 01:04:06.813
Yeah, it's some pretty bad shit

01:04:06.924 --> 01:04:08.186
and she's a brave girl.

01:04:10.027 --> 01:04:12.027
I want to thank you again
for what you did outside.

01:04:12.095 --> 01:04:13.620
I appreciate that.

01:04:13.763 --> 01:04:15.595
Secondly, and most importantly,

01:04:15.933 --> 01:04:17.924
we've got to get out of here.

01:04:18.036 --> 01:04:19.593
Now, what's your
van situation like?

01:04:19.703 --> 01:04:20.794
Well, shoot.

01:04:20.938 --> 01:04:23.202
The tank's as empty as
your friend's skull here.

01:04:23.307 --> 01:04:24.968
I was hoping to fill her up

01:04:25.042 --> 01:04:27.010
and those freaks
turned up again.

01:04:27.111 --> 01:04:28.855
I know if we wait it out
and stay real hushed

01:04:28.879 --> 01:04:30.210
that they're gonna fuck off.

01:04:30.314 --> 01:04:31.781
They don't seem too bright.

01:04:31.849 --> 01:04:33.315
That's not an option.

01:04:33.383 --> 01:04:35.851
I wasn't joking when l said
we have to get out of here soon.

01:04:42.226 --> 01:04:43.852
An atomic fucking bomb?

01:04:45.294 --> 01:04:47.160
Here?

01:04:47.564 --> 01:04:49.464
You're shitting me, right?

01:04:49.800 --> 01:04:52.064
Well, what the fuck
are we going to do now?

01:04:52.168 --> 01:04:54.033
General Carter's plans
include our deaths,

01:04:54.137 --> 01:04:56.002
so here we are.

01:04:56.573 --> 01:04:57.717
I'm sorry we got you and Claire

01:04:57.741 --> 01:04:59.641
involved in this, Doug.

01:04:59.743 --> 01:05:01.335
Shit.

01:05:01.412 --> 01:05:02.772
I thought this was
gonna be a nice,

01:05:02.812 --> 01:05:04.074
relaxing trip,

01:05:04.181 --> 01:05:07.480
but no, those goblin
donkey fuckers...

01:05:08.419 --> 01:05:10.979
Always gotta mess with an
honest man's piece of mind!

01:05:13.589 --> 01:05:15.420
Shit!

01:05:15.525 --> 01:05:17.357
If we're gonna die together,

01:05:17.460 --> 01:05:19.520
we might as well die with
no hard feelings.

01:05:19.630 --> 01:05:20.960
Drink up, my friend.

01:05:24.100 --> 01:05:25.499
The amber nectar.

01:05:30.773 --> 01:05:32.365
I didn't have any hard feelings.

01:05:34.677 --> 01:05:36.008
Friend.

01:05:39.549 --> 01:05:41.380
What now?

01:05:41.451 --> 01:05:42.884
I don't know.

01:05:44.787 --> 01:05:46.049
I really don't know.

01:05:47.723 --> 01:05:49.555
I guess l'm never gonna
open that restaurant.

01:05:51.861 --> 01:05:53.055
Sorry, Dragan.

01:05:53.163 --> 01:05:54.424
At least we die with honor.

01:05:56.232 --> 01:05:57.755
You guys being serious?

01:05:59.236 --> 01:06:01.100
No.

01:06:01.471 --> 01:06:03.371
No, we can't give up.

01:06:04.040 --> 01:06:06.702
Not while that timer
is still counting down.

01:06:06.809 --> 01:06:08.710
If we die here,

01:06:09.813 --> 01:06:12.144
Carter will have it
all his own way

01:06:12.248 --> 01:06:13.943
and nobody...

01:06:14.050 --> 01:06:16.541
no one will ever know the truth.

01:06:20.823 --> 01:06:22.085
The airport is close.

01:06:22.158 --> 01:06:23.751
We still have enough
time to get to it.

01:06:23.826 --> 01:06:24.885
We have to get to it!

01:06:26.230 --> 01:06:28.061
The world needs to know
what happened here.

01:06:30.434 --> 01:06:31.901
Please.

01:06:33.270 --> 01:06:34.270
Please?

01:06:34.337 --> 01:06:35.965
She's right.

01:06:36.072 --> 01:06:38.337
Fuck, l don't even know who
this Carter guy is,

01:06:38.442 --> 01:06:40.774
but if this
fucked-up shit is down to him

01:06:40.844 --> 01:06:42.055
then l certainly want to
give him

01:06:42.079 --> 01:06:44.138
a very large piece of my mind.

01:06:44.248 --> 01:06:46.113
Fuck, l hate uniforms!

01:06:46.616 --> 01:06:48.243
They're all fucked in the head!

01:06:50.788 --> 01:06:52.186
No offense, fellas.

01:06:52.289 --> 01:06:54.049
But you gotta put yourself
in my shoes, okay?

01:06:54.124 --> 01:06:57.092
L... l nearly
died today, hmm?

01:07:07.104 --> 01:07:09.367
Honey pie, you still
pointing that thing at me?

01:07:09.472 --> 01:07:10.963
My God, the way you carrying on,

01:07:11.108 --> 01:07:12.541
the only memory you're gonna

01:07:12.643 --> 01:07:16.135
have of this entire trip
is gonna be my ugly mug!

01:07:20.116 --> 01:07:22.881
Well, at least it looks
like this goddamn rain

01:07:22.986 --> 01:07:24.681
is finally quitting.

01:07:24.788 --> 01:07:26.517
Ahh...

01:07:26.623 --> 01:07:28.385
You should point this thing out,

01:07:28.491 --> 01:07:31.983
get some of this amazing
foreign scenery,

01:07:32.095 --> 01:07:33.789
'cause, you know... you know,

01:07:33.863 --> 01:07:36.627
l think we are very
close now, you know.

01:07:36.732 --> 01:07:38.199
I think we're almost there.

01:07:38.334 --> 01:07:39.494
Are you ready?

01:07:39.635 --> 01:07:41.399
I said,
"Are you ready?"

01:07:41.504 --> 01:07:42.528
To meet the one,

01:07:42.673 --> 01:07:45.733
the only, Count Dracula!

01:07:47.810 --> 01:07:49.505
Oh, what is this now?

01:07:51.147 --> 01:07:53.012
Shit.

01:08:00.656 --> 01:08:02.647
Stay in the van, honey pie.

01:08:10.365 --> 01:08:12.163
Can you hear me, sweetheart?

01:08:18.407 --> 01:08:19.600
You okay?

01:08:24.046 --> 01:08:26.537
Oh, what the fuck?!

01:08:32.856 --> 01:08:34.185
Honey pie!

01:08:41.863 --> 01:08:42.863
Oh, Jesus, God!

01:08:44.066 --> 01:08:45.533
What the fuck?!

01:08:45.635 --> 01:08:48.968
Get the shit out of my life,
you fucking crazy

01:08:51.805 --> 01:08:52.968
You...

01:08:59.814 --> 01:09:01.715
Next time, honey...

01:09:02.082 --> 01:09:03.416
keep your eyes open!

01:09:09.758 --> 01:09:11.589
I kid you not.

01:09:11.725 --> 01:09:13.456
I almost did a little poo.

01:09:15.163 --> 01:09:16.573
We're gonna have to
thin down their number

01:09:16.598 --> 01:09:18.037
if we're gonna get
out of here alive.

01:09:19.100 --> 01:09:20.661
Doug, how many bullets
do you have left?

01:09:23.104 --> 01:09:24.765
Just two, l'm afraid.

01:09:26.910 --> 01:09:28.252
Maybe we could
draw their attention

01:09:28.277 --> 01:09:30.073
like we did back at
the police station.

01:09:31.747 --> 01:09:33.009
How?

01:09:37.620 --> 01:09:38.952
Holy shit!

01:09:39.022 --> 01:09:40.180
I can't get a clear shot!

01:09:40.288 --> 01:09:41.288
Fuck you!

01:09:41.357 --> 01:09:42.823
Oh my God, sweetness!

01:09:42.925 --> 01:09:45.484
No, no, fuck you!

01:09:47.263 --> 01:09:48.595
Honey pie!

01:09:50.434 --> 01:09:51.798
No!

01:09:54.638 --> 01:09:57.037
Jesus Christ, put the gun down,
darling, please?

01:09:57.139 --> 01:09:58.970
Please, sweetheart,
put the gun down,

01:09:59.041 --> 01:10:00.881
we'll be fine, we'll
we'll get you to a doctor,

01:10:00.943 --> 01:10:02.934
l swear, you'll be fine,
sweetheart, please!

01:10:04.647 --> 01:10:05.705
No!

01:10:05.816 --> 01:10:07.646
Sweetie pie, no!

01:10:09.285 --> 01:10:11.048
Nothing l can do...

01:10:11.153 --> 01:10:13.018
Oh, God.

01:10:13.289 --> 01:10:14.517
Sweetie pie.

01:10:14.991 --> 01:10:16.981
Oh, please...
oh, God.

01:10:17.059 --> 01:10:18.856
Jesus.

01:10:18.961 --> 01:10:19.985
If you got any good ideas

01:10:20.096 --> 01:10:22.428
left in that
brain of yours, chief,

01:10:22.732 --> 01:10:24.790
now is the time to
come up with it.

01:10:24.899 --> 01:10:25.978
Without gassing up the truck,

01:10:26.002 --> 01:10:27.468
we're not going anywhere.

01:10:29.171 --> 01:10:30.482
Maybe we can find
a vehicle around here

01:10:30.506 --> 01:10:32.497
to get out of here with.

01:10:32.674 --> 01:10:33.733
Maybe...

01:10:35.143 --> 01:10:36.737
just maybe

01:10:36.847 --> 01:10:38.074
we've still got a chance.

01:10:38.180 --> 01:10:39.909
I still love you
so much, my sweetie.

01:10:40.015 --> 01:10:41.915
What do you have in mind?

01:10:44.185 --> 01:10:46.105
You're gonna have to
trust me on this one, chief.

01:10:49.358 --> 01:10:51.019
Princess.

01:10:51.127 --> 01:10:52.560
How far to the airport?

01:10:52.660 --> 01:10:53.889
Five miles at the most.

01:10:55.530 --> 01:10:58.557
I'm gonna try and buy you
as much time as possible.

01:10:58.702 --> 01:11:00.566
Godspeed, my friend.

01:11:01.170 --> 01:11:02.227
John...

01:11:03.539 --> 01:11:06.338
Oh, God, no...

01:11:07.209 --> 01:11:08.938
Mad Dog.

01:11:09.044 --> 01:11:10.204
L'll be fine.

01:11:11.846 --> 01:11:14.247
How are we gonna
know when to get out?

01:11:14.350 --> 01:11:16.214
You'll know.

01:11:16.385 --> 01:11:17.784
My friend...

01:11:17.888 --> 01:11:19.115
you'll know.

01:11:22.892 --> 01:11:24.689
Jesus Christ.

01:11:25.927 --> 01:11:27.088
No!

01:11:40.409 --> 01:11:42.740
And what are you
doing here, Princess?

01:11:43.078 --> 01:11:44.567
Time to get serious, John.

01:11:44.646 --> 01:11:46.136
Serious?

01:11:46.247 --> 01:11:48.047
Don't you think the timing's
a little bit off?

01:11:51.487 --> 01:11:53.386
I think you should go,

01:11:54.088 --> 01:11:57.181
before l get...
other ideas.

01:12:01.062 --> 01:12:03.122
General Carter will get
what he fucking deserves.

01:12:03.265 --> 01:12:04.458
Come on, now.

01:12:04.599 --> 01:12:06.294
Get it together, man,
get it together.

01:12:06.434 --> 01:12:08.300
Oh...

01:12:08.570 --> 01:12:09.833
Fuck!

01:12:12.273 --> 01:12:14.104
Come on, you motherfuckers!

01:12:14.175 --> 01:12:15.267
Come on!

01:12:17.913 --> 01:12:19.277
Jack, just go!

01:12:19.348 --> 01:12:20.576
Go!

01:12:49.645 --> 01:12:51.204
All right, let's go!

01:12:52.615 --> 01:12:54.480
Doug!

01:12:54.650 --> 01:12:57.641
I'm gonna cut your friend
the General's eyelids off,

01:12:58.721 --> 01:13:01.053
staple this here photo
to his forehead,

01:13:01.991 --> 01:13:04.186
while l gut him like a boar!

01:13:04.293 --> 01:13:05.453
We'll get him.

01:13:17.239 --> 01:13:19.139
Ugh, Dragan...

01:13:19.910 --> 01:13:21.467
l think l'm gonna
need you on this one.

01:13:29.150 --> 01:13:32.211
Come on then!

01:13:32.354 --> 01:13:33.753
Ya wee shits!

01:13:35.524 --> 01:13:37.219
Run, Eden, run!

01:13:37.326 --> 01:13:38.485
Never!

01:13:40.629 --> 01:13:42.028
John, Eden, come on!

01:13:42.164 --> 01:13:44.723
Get out of here!

01:13:44.867 --> 01:13:46.061
God, God

01:13:50.204 --> 01:13:52.070
lt is...

01:13:53.876 --> 01:13:55.867
time to meet again!

01:14:06.221 --> 01:14:09.712
Drive!

01:14:39.921 --> 01:14:41.387
General!

01:14:44.225 --> 01:14:45.783
What is it, Private?

01:14:45.893 --> 01:14:48.225
They stopped just outside
the city's perimeter.

01:14:50.431 --> 01:14:51.829
Orders, sir?

01:14:51.933 --> 01:14:54.266
Tell the special forces
to be ready.

01:14:54.602 --> 01:14:56.467
I want the girl.

01:14:56.571 --> 01:14:58.334
Kill the others.

01:14:58.439 --> 01:14:59.997
Is the helicopter ready?

01:15:00.174 --> 01:15:01.663
Yes, sir.

01:15:01.776 --> 01:15:02.835
Let's go.

01:15:02.945 --> 01:15:04.172
We're running out of time.

01:15:04.278 --> 01:15:05.576
Yes, sir.

01:15:45.454 --> 01:15:47.012
How many shots do you have left?

01:15:47.122 --> 01:15:48.713
Still just the two, Jack.

01:15:48.824 --> 01:15:50.601
God, l tried to get 'em
to breed, but, you know,

01:15:50.625 --> 01:15:52.320
they just ain't in the mood.

01:15:52.427 --> 01:15:53.623
Damn.

01:15:53.696 --> 01:15:54.873
You have more
in common with John

01:15:54.897 --> 01:15:56.694
than just a shitty attitude.

01:15:56.832 --> 01:15:58.093
What's the plan?

01:15:59.834 --> 01:16:02.064
I say we get out there,
we kill Carter.

01:16:04.006 --> 01:16:05.405
Let's go.

01:16:37.940 --> 01:16:38.940
Well, well.

01:16:39.041 --> 01:16:40.598
I'm impressed.

01:16:40.709 --> 01:16:43.040
L've got to give you
credit, Stone.

01:16:43.211 --> 01:16:45.077
I underestimated you.

01:16:45.681 --> 01:16:47.376
It's a pity.

01:16:47.449 --> 01:16:49.040
I could have
used a man like you.

01:16:52.286 --> 01:16:54.277
And who's this...
hero?

01:16:55.723 --> 01:16:57.748
Put the toy down.

01:16:59.327 --> 01:17:00.419
Put it down, Doug.

01:17:06.534 --> 01:17:07.593
It's all right, girl.

01:17:07.736 --> 01:17:09.066
He gonna get his.

01:17:10.538 --> 01:17:11.903
You let her go.

01:17:13.574 --> 01:17:14.802
Or l will kill you.

01:17:17.578 --> 01:17:20.240
You're in no position
to be giving orders.

01:17:20.581 --> 01:17:22.412
We placed the bomb.

01:17:22.483 --> 01:17:24.541
My mission...
is accomplished.

01:17:26.587 --> 01:17:28.487
Give me back my daughter
and let us go.

01:17:29.824 --> 01:17:31.291
What more do you want from us?

01:17:31.392 --> 01:17:32.620
Her.

01:17:33.728 --> 01:17:34.922
What?

01:17:35.061 --> 01:17:36.261
You're much more precious than

01:17:36.297 --> 01:17:38.424
you think you are,
Ms. Neumann.

01:17:38.566 --> 01:17:39.760
You hold within yourself

01:17:39.934 --> 01:17:42.266
the secret of your
father's great work.

01:17:42.436 --> 01:17:44.301
I don't understand.

01:17:44.405 --> 01:17:46.270
Your blood.

01:17:46.507 --> 01:17:48.441
From that, we will synthesize

01:17:48.509 --> 01:17:50.272
your father's vaccine

01:17:50.344 --> 01:17:52.835
and Project "K" can continue
without any more

01:17:52.947 --> 01:17:54.778
unfortunate accidents.

01:17:56.784 --> 01:17:58.183
Isn't it a pity there's no room

01:17:58.286 --> 01:18:01.254
for your new friends
in our helicopter.

01:18:02.623 --> 01:18:05.489
I think we can allow
the little family reunion.

01:18:08.763 --> 01:18:10.424
Christine...

01:18:10.531 --> 01:18:12.260
in exchange
for Ms. Neumann.

01:18:13.301 --> 01:18:14.962
After all, we're not monsters.

01:18:18.472 --> 01:18:19.962
Ms. Neumann.

01:18:23.644 --> 01:18:24.803
Jack.

01:18:26.279 --> 01:18:27.439
Shit.

01:18:37.491 --> 01:18:38.823
Come here.

01:18:43.497 --> 01:18:45.021
Well...

01:18:45.166 --> 01:18:47.532
l think it's time we were
leaving, gentlemen.

01:18:51.973 --> 01:18:53.668
Jack, run!

01:18:55.076 --> 01:18:56.407
Go, get them!

01:19:21.602 --> 01:19:22.694
All right, honey.

01:19:22.837 --> 01:19:24.270
You stay right here,
and remember,

01:19:24.372 --> 01:19:26.737
be really quiet, okay?

01:19:26.841 --> 01:19:28.206
Jack.

01:19:29.710 --> 01:19:33.271
You hold lndiana, she's
gonna keep you safe, okay?

01:19:33.381 --> 01:19:34.541
They're a-comin'.

01:19:34.615 --> 01:19:36.048
We gotta go.

01:20:14.555 --> 01:20:16.079
Let's do this Alabama style!

01:20:35.343 --> 01:20:36.343
Come on!

01:20:36.444 --> 01:20:37.808
You bastard!

01:20:54.762 --> 01:20:56.092
I told you l hate uniforms.

01:21:05.271 --> 01:21:06.271
Come on!

01:21:09.142 --> 01:21:10.286
Okay, honey, you go with Doug

01:21:10.310 --> 01:21:11.641
and run to the chopper.

01:21:11.711 --> 01:21:12.974
I'm gonna go look for Sam.

01:21:15.382 --> 01:21:17.145
Jack, run!

01:21:25.792 --> 01:21:27.350
No!

01:21:27.460 --> 01:21:28.518
Shit!

01:21:32.632 --> 01:21:34.497
Come on, gotta keep up!

01:21:42.977 --> 01:21:44.672
Go, Sam, get to the helicopter!

01:21:51.518 --> 01:21:53.350
Holy shit!

01:22:04.433 --> 01:22:06.366
I don't know
where the hell you from,

01:22:06.434 --> 01:22:07.765
but l know this is gonna hurt!

01:22:19.847 --> 01:22:21.712
Take that, you son of a bitch!

01:22:21.782 --> 01:22:23.043
Yeah!

01:22:46.707 --> 01:22:48.571
You know, in the end...

01:22:48.709 --> 01:22:50.403
that bastard got what he wanted.

01:22:51.811 --> 01:22:53.711
How do you mean?

01:22:54.582 --> 01:22:55.582
The general's dead.

01:22:55.649 --> 01:22:57.138
Ain't shit left of him.

01:22:57.251 --> 01:22:58.979
Or the evidence.

01:22:59.085 --> 01:23:00.950
I mean, come on, Doug.

01:23:01.421 --> 01:23:03.286
Who's gonna believe our story?

01:23:03.823 --> 01:23:06.224
I wouldn't be so sure
of that, little miss.

01:23:10.096 --> 01:23:12.064
L'd sure as hell like
to see 'em deny this.

01:23:13.133 --> 01:23:14.429
Ahh, Jesus, God...

01:23:15.669 --> 01:23:16.936
What the fuck?!

01:23:16.937 --> 01:23:19.405
Get the shit out of my life,
you fucking...

01:23:20.907 --> 01:23:23.501
You know, my old man
always used to say,

01:23:23.610 --> 01:23:25.511
men don't learn shit
from their mistakes.

01:23:26.946 --> 01:23:28.811
Anything that happened once...

01:23:30.084 --> 01:23:31.983
bound to happen again
sooner or later.

01:23:32.085 --> 01:23:34.349
Well, Doug,
l don't know if a few men

01:23:34.454 --> 01:23:35.979
can make a difference,

01:23:36.090 --> 01:23:38.200
but sometimes it can be enough
to just kick the right ass

01:23:38.224 --> 01:23:39.418
at the right time.

01:26:14.649 --> 01:26:18.114
Come on, ladies.
You ain't seen nothing yet.
