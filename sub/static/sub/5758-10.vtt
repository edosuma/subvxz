00:01.439 --> 00:03.140
<i>Previously on Pretty Little Liars...</i>

00:03.260 --> 00:06.011
- Wait, I've been here before.
- This is Noel Kahn's cabin.

00:06.131 --> 00:07.131
<i>Based on your testimony,</i>

00:07.165 --> 00:08.199
the board has decided

00:08.233 --> 00:10.034
to delay any decision
to transfer Mona.

00:10.068 --> 00:11.302
She gets to stay.
Oh, my God!

00:13.305 --> 00:16.140
You own this place?
I'm Zack.

00:17.409 --> 00:19.343
Gotta say,
she's pretty intriguing.

00:19.378 --> 00:21.279
I want to know more.
No, you don't.

00:21.313 --> 00:23.414
So you figured out
there's another "A" out there.

00:23.448 --> 00:25.349
Caleb, you don't even know
what that means!

00:25.384 --> 00:28.386
When you told us about Emily, you never
mentioned that Noel was with you that night.

00:28.420 --> 00:30.121
What else did you lie about?

00:30.155 --> 00:31.989
You got somebody pregnant
in high school?

00:32.024 --> 00:33.457
What happened?
My mom happened.

00:33.492 --> 00:35.226
Your mom offered her money.

00:35.260 --> 00:36.427
I drank from the flask.

00:36.461 --> 00:38.296
It was the night that
somebody dug up Ali's grave.

00:38.330 --> 00:42.400
And I'm trying to find out what happened to me.
You were with me.

00:42.434 --> 00:44.101
What's the best way
to get around

00:44.136 --> 00:46.437
<i>really tough password</i>
<i>protection?</i>

00:46.471 --> 00:48.339
So this really is Maya's site.
<i>Beware.</i>

00:48.373 --> 00:51.042
This site is cursed.

00:56.248 --> 00:58.082
Yeah. They sentis thing's
the wrong one.Ze of a redwood.

00:58.116 --> 01:02.987
Let's just move it off to the side until
they can come back and pick it up.

01:03.021 --> 01:04.322
A little help here?

01:04.355 --> 01:07.124
I think it's perfect
where it is.

01:09.227 --> 01:12.229
Just move the
small plants out of the way

01:12.264 --> 01:14.465
so I can slide that one
over there.

01:27.145 --> 01:30.014
"Emily, I'm so sorry
for everything.

01:30.048 --> 01:31.949
"I know we've had
a disconnect lately.

01:31.983 --> 01:33.317
"Iope you'll give me
a chance to explain.

01:33.352 --> 01:35.286
"I have to show you something.

01:35.320 --> 01:38.155
"Don't call my cell.
Someone stole it.

01:38.190 --> 01:40.124
Meet me at..."

01:40.158 --> 01:42.226
"Meet me." Where?

01:42.260 --> 01:44.061
I don't know.
I can't tell.

01:44.096 --> 01:46.263
It looks like it's been
washed out by the rain.

01:46.298 --> 01:48.966
Are you sure that this is from Maya?
Positive.

01:49.000 --> 01:51.936
I wonder what
she wanted to show you.

01:51.970 --> 01:55.072
The police have said all along
that she probably found something

01:55.107 --> 01:58.242
that proved Garrett killed Ali.
Which is why she was killed.

01:58.276 --> 02:00.344
You guys, we need to slow down,

02:00.379 --> 02:02.980
because we have no idea
when Maya wrote that note,

02:03.014 --> 02:06.150
and it could have been any time
after Emily moved in here with you.

02:06.184 --> 02:09.286
It looks like there's a date
on the top right corner. Look.

02:13.158 --> 02:16.127
Oh, my God.

02:16.161 --> 02:19.096
Maya wrote this
the day she died.

02:27.005 --> 02:29.240
<i>♪ Got a secret,</i>
<i>can you keep it ♪</i>

02:29.274 --> 02:32.076

02:56.234 --> 02:59.236
Wow!
You brought a lot!

03:00.305 --> 03:02.940
What are these, Cranberries?

03:02.974 --> 03:05.109
Jalapenos.

03:13.051 --> 03:15.085
Aren't you gonna be late?

03:17.322 --> 03:19.990
How much would you
have to pay someone

03:20.025 --> 03:22.893
to make them fall off
the face of the earth?

03:22.928 --> 03:25.029
Are you talking about...
Maggie.

03:25.063 --> 03:27.998
Clearly, your mom must have
given her a lot.

03:28.033 --> 03:31.068
I would imagine.
You don't know?

03:31.102 --> 03:34.004
You... you really
never asked Maggie?

03:34.039 --> 03:38.375
I asked, but she never
or emails. Y phone calls

03:40.345 --> 03:43.214
I looked for her
for months, Aria.

03:43.248 --> 03:45.883
Eventually I had to
accept the fact

03:45.917 --> 03:47.351
that maybe she
didn't want to be found.

03:47.385 --> 03:50.221
Why didn't you just
tell me about her?

03:52.324 --> 03:56.327
Because she's part of a past
that I tried to forget.

03:56.361 --> 04:00.364
And when we first met
every skeleton in my closet.

04:00.398 --> 04:03.300
But you could have
I found out about Jackie.

04:03.335 --> 04:06.303
Ezra, we've been
for over a year now!

04:06.338 --> 04:09.907
And you took a very long time
to tell me about Jenna, and "A."

04:09.941 --> 04:13.010
This is completely
different than that.

04:17.281 --> 04:19.016
Do you want this toasted?

04:20.218 --> 04:23.087
Actually, I think
I'll eat later.

04:23.121 --> 04:25.256
I should probably
hop in the shower.

04:41.306 --> 04:43.274
I'm cutting you off
after this one.

04:43.308 --> 04:46.110
No. There is just so much to look at.
I've seen it all.

04:46.144 --> 04:49.013
Believe me, I've done nothing
the past few days. T

04:49.047 --> 04:50.881
I'm a fresh pair of eyes.

04:50.916 --> 04:53.017
There might be something on here
that will help us figure out

04:53.051 --> 04:55.152
where Maya wanted you
to meet her.

04:58.023 --> 05:00.357
I should give Jeff a hand.
He's new.

05:06.932 --> 05:08.933
Hey.
Hi.

05:08.967 --> 05:11.902
You haven't been in
to see Mona lately.

05:11.937 --> 05:13.904
I have had
a super-busy week.

05:13.939 --> 05:15.272
Well, next time you go,
let me know,

05:15.307 --> 05:18.008
we could grab coffee.

05:19.277 --> 05:23.013
Look, Wren,
what happened the other day...

05:23.048 --> 05:24.315
I've been thinking
about it too.

05:24.349 --> 05:26.216
Actually, um,

05:26.251 --> 05:28.919
not much else since then.

05:31.089 --> 05:33.958
It can't happen again.

05:33.992 --> 05:37.027
Oh. All right.

05:37.062 --> 05:39.296
Look, Spencer's my best friend.

05:39.331 --> 05:42.266
I thought she was with Toby.
No, she is.

05:42.300 --> 05:46.170
But I mean, a best friend
doesn't really date an ex.

05:46.204 --> 05:49.340
And Caleb and I...
broke up. Right?

05:49.374 --> 05:53.277
Look, it's just too soon for me
to see anybody else right now.

05:53.311 --> 05:56.013
I'm really sorry.

05:56.047 --> 05:58.048
Don't be.
I understand.

05:59.150 --> 06:02.252
If you change your mind,
you know where to find me.

06:18.036 --> 06:21.939
How many times
have you reread that?

06:21.973 --> 06:24.208
Too many.

06:24.242 --> 06:27.878
Didn't you and Maya have a spot that
you liked to hang out at by the lake?

06:27.912 --> 06:31.115
Yeah. I was just there
with Nate the other day.

06:31.149 --> 06:33.851
Maybe that's where
she wanted you to meet her.

06:33.885 --> 06:36.120
We could go together. I could
help you take a look around.

06:36.154 --> 06:39.089
I don't even know what
I'm supposed to be looking for.

06:42.994 --> 06:45.863
Have you heard from Toby?
He called last night.

06:45.897 --> 06:48.132
He's waiting on
a permit for the loft,

06:48.166 --> 06:50.234
so he took a job
in bucks county.

06:50.268 --> 06:54.238
Honestly, I'm relieved he's not
here, I'm not lying to him.

06:54.272 --> 06:59.176
Yeah. Lying to Toby is like
lying to the dalai lama.

06:59.210 --> 07:01.879
I don't how much more
of this "A" I can handle.

07:01.913 --> 07:04.114
I mean, I survived Mona
with straight a's,

07:04.149 --> 07:07.217
and now I'm like failing
everything, even physics.

07:07.252 --> 07:10.854
Spence, it's gonna be okay. And
a "b" is far from failing.

07:10.889 --> 07:12.022
"B" is for "bad."

07:12.057 --> 07:13.190
Hi, guys.

07:13.224 --> 07:14.992
Hey, Paige.

07:15.026 --> 07:18.095
Um, I'll talk to you later.
Yeah.

07:18.129 --> 07:19.863
Ready for lunch?

07:19.898 --> 07:22.132
I can't. Coach Morgan
asked me into her office.

07:22.167 --> 07:25.869
Oh, wow. Maybe she's gonna ask you
to swim the last leg of the relay.

07:25.904 --> 07:28.205
I hope so.
I've been dying for that spot.

07:28.239 --> 07:30.808
Well, if anyone
deserves it, it's you.

07:30.842 --> 07:33.210
Thanks.
I'll let you know.

07:36.014 --> 07:39.016
<i>♪ Feels so right to love you ♪</i>

07:39.050 --> 07:41.985
<i>♪ so much I want to say ♪</i>

08:02.874 --> 08:06.009
Mmm. Freshly baked bread,
brie and hummus.

08:06.044 --> 08:08.812
I don't think I've ever
been so spoiled.

08:08.847 --> 08:11.815
Yeah. I grow those tomatoes
in my back yard.

08:11.850 --> 08:14.818
I kind of have a green thumb...
Ya know.

08:14.853 --> 08:18.255
Wow. Man of many talents.

08:18.289 --> 08:21.158
Yeah. And, uh, also...

08:21.192 --> 08:25.162
I managed to smuggle in a little bottle
of prosecco, if you want a taste.

08:25.196 --> 08:28.065
I think we should probably
save that for tomorrow night.

08:28.099 --> 08:30.134
I have to teach
Shakespeare today,

08:30.168 --> 08:34.004
and I don't think I should be slurring
my way through the iambic pentameter.

08:34.038 --> 08:36.807
Yeah, that's probably
a good idea.

08:36.841 --> 08:37.941
Yeah.

08:44.949 --> 08:46.917
Hey, mom.

08:46.951 --> 08:49.219
Hi... Honey.

08:50.255 --> 08:52.289
This is Zack.
Hey.

08:52.323 --> 08:54.992
I've heard great things
about you.

08:57.262 --> 08:58.929
You're Zack.

09:00.899 --> 09:03.066
You... you did all this?

09:03.101 --> 09:05.803
Yeah, there's plenty left
if you're hungry.

09:05.837 --> 09:08.005
No, I'm...
I'm good, thanks.

09:14.212 --> 09:16.079
I should go.

09:16.114 --> 09:19.116
Um, cannolis
waiting to be stuffed.

09:19.150 --> 09:22.019
I'll see you tomorrow, babe.
Yes, you will.

09:22.053 --> 09:24.087
It was great meeting you.
Yeah, you... you too.

09:28.259 --> 09:29.927
"Babe"?

09:29.961 --> 09:33.197
So? He's cute, right?
<i>Very.</i>

09:33.231 --> 09:35.165
Yeah, you just...

09:35.200 --> 09:38.035
Didn't mention
how different he was.

09:38.069 --> 09:40.070
Different than who?

09:40.104 --> 09:42.906
Or is "different"
code for "young"?

09:42.941 --> 09:45.909
No. I... I don't have
a problem with his age.

09:45.944 --> 09:47.244
Mom, did you tell him yours?

09:47.278 --> 09:50.180
We've been very honest
with each other.

09:50.215 --> 09:54.284
Okay. Well... It's a
good start, I guess.

09:54.319 --> 09:57.020
We'll talk.
We'll talk after school.

09:57.055 --> 09:59.089
Yeah. Yeah.
Talk. We'll talk.

10:02.160 --> 10:04.228
Okay, bye.
Yeah. We'll...

10:06.231 --> 10:07.998
hmm.

10:16.307 --> 10:20.210
What's this? Have you
taken up scrapbooking?

10:20.245 --> 10:24.248
No, I blew up the photos
from Maya's website.

10:24.282 --> 10:26.216
Uh, all of them?

10:26.251 --> 10:28.886
Yes. And I organized them
by date and location,

10:28.920 --> 10:32.155
and I really think I'm on to something here.
<i>On</i> something.

10:32.190 --> 10:34.958
You can see details you weren't
able to see on the screen.

10:34.993 --> 10:38.128
Okay, I appreciate all the
effort you're putting into this,

10:38.162 --> 10:43.200
but if I didn't know better, I would think
that Maya was <i>your</i> girlfriend, not mine.

10:43.234 --> 10:46.069
What's going on?

10:46.104 --> 10:48.305
Caleb knows about "A."

10:48.339 --> 10:50.173
What?! How?

10:50.208 --> 10:51.341
He went on Maya's website,

10:51.376 --> 10:54.311
and he knew I was
keeping something from him,

10:54.345 --> 10:56.980
so he put two and two together.
Did you tell him everything?

10:57.015 --> 10:59.082
Yeah, enough for him to know
that it's too dangerous

10:59.117 --> 11:01.151
for us to be together
while "A" is still out there.

11:01.185 --> 11:04.888
So you two are just pretending
to <i>no</i> be together?

11:04.923 --> 11:07.024
Yes. And it's killing me.

11:07.058 --> 11:09.960
So as much as I love you
and I really want to help you,

11:09.994 --> 11:12.062
I'm doing this for me too.

11:12.096 --> 11:14.197
Hand me some pictures.

11:16.968 --> 11:20.337
Leave it to Maya
to make even pajamas look sexy.

11:20.371 --> 11:22.139
Yeah, there's
a few more like it.

11:22.173 --> 11:24.841
Those are some of
the last ones she posted.

11:24.876 --> 11:27.110
What is this behind her?

11:27.145 --> 11:30.113
I don't know.
A shed, maybe?

11:30.148 --> 11:32.249
Oh, my God.
What?

11:32.283 --> 11:35.118
That's Noel Kahn's cabin.

11:39.891 --> 11:42.859
Wait. Why would Maya
be there during the day?

11:42.894 --> 11:44.194
All of Eric's parties
were at night.

11:44.228 --> 11:48.899
She was in her pajamas,
so she must have stayed over.

11:48.933 --> 11:51.335
I mean, that's...
What it looks like.

11:51.369 --> 11:53.036
I'll call you back.

11:53.071 --> 11:54.938
Hey.

11:54.973 --> 11:56.273
You have a good time
the other night?

11:56.307 --> 11:58.875
Yeah. All my dreams
came true.

11:58.910 --> 12:00.277
Jenna was right.

12:00.311 --> 12:03.013
You just can't seem to stay
out of other people's business.

12:03.047 --> 12:05.882
You lied to me.
Which time?

12:05.917 --> 12:09.052
Well, I know that Maya wasn't just
a random guest at your party.

12:09.087 --> 12:11.888
Random? No.

12:11.923 --> 12:15.826
So she was what?
A friend?

12:15.860 --> 12:19.062
Not exactly. We had
a texting relationship.

12:19.097 --> 12:22.265
Meaning what? Meaning I hooked her
up with weed once in a while.

12:22.300 --> 12:25.268
Oh. Was this before or after
you and Jenna

12:25.303 --> 12:28.005
started sneaking around
in the middle of the night?

12:28.039 --> 12:31.108
It's kind of hot knowing you
think I'm capable of murder.

12:48.119 --> 12:51.121
Hey. Want a cappuccino?
I make a mean swirl.

12:51.155 --> 12:53.189
Let's do it.

12:53.224 --> 12:57.427
So, um, I found out that the band Maya used
to jam with is playing in town next week.

12:57.461 --> 13:00.430
The owl kings are back together?
Looks like it.

13:00.464 --> 13:04.267
I never got to hear them live.
Want to go?

13:09.240 --> 13:11.441
So that's the guy
she dissed me for.

13:11.475 --> 13:14.110
Trust me, you dodged
a bullet on that one.

13:14.145 --> 13:16.279
I gotta get to practice.
Okay, bye.

13:17.448 --> 13:18.481
See you later.

13:25.456 --> 13:28.358
The way she looked past me
you'd think she was still blind.

13:43.341 --> 13:46.309
I have a gift for you.
Excuse me?

13:46.344 --> 13:49.079
I never got a chance to give it
to you because you blew me off.

13:49.113 --> 13:51.414
Oh. Well, that's nice,
but I can't accept it.

13:51.449 --> 13:53.350
You can't accept
a birthday gift?

13:53.384 --> 13:56.453
Well, considering we never went out,
I don't think it would be right.

13:56.487 --> 14:00.156
I insist. Where can I find you tomorrow?
I'll drop it off.

14:00.191 --> 14:02.392
Should I swing by your place,
say, around three?

14:02.426 --> 14:05.228
I have to go.
Or I can just meet you here.

14:05.262 --> 14:08.098
Please move out of my way.

14:48.339 --> 14:50.440
Hey, you.
Are you heading home?

14:50.508 --> 14:53.343
Hey. Yeah. We can
walk home together.

14:53.377 --> 14:55.512
Okay, but we gotta go now
because I have a coffee date.

14:55.546 --> 15:00.183
With Zack? No, uh, with Jim.
Or maybe it's Luke.

15:00.217 --> 15:02.118
You're not sure who it's with?

15:02.153 --> 15:03.253
Well, I have to check my email.

15:03.287 --> 15:06.055
I mean, it might be
Jim on Saturday

15:06.090 --> 15:08.091
and Luke today
at the morning stir.

15:08.125 --> 15:12.362
So... Zack isn't
anything serious?

15:12.396 --> 15:15.398
He's handsome and smart

15:15.433 --> 15:18.268
and he's certainly
boosted my ego...

15:18.302 --> 15:20.336
I'm pretty sure
you boosted his, too.

15:20.371 --> 15:22.272
Yeah, but something tells me
there's plenty of ladies

15:22.306 --> 15:24.441
stopping by the coffee shop
to inflate it for him.

15:24.475 --> 15:27.210
I don't know about that.
He seemed really into you.

15:28.446 --> 15:30.980
Yep. No, I was right.
It's Jim today

15:31.015 --> 15:34.250
and then Luke on Saturday
and Zack Saturday night.

15:34.285 --> 15:36.085
Whoa, whoa.

15:36.120 --> 15:37.454
Slow it down.

15:37.488 --> 15:40.356
You haven't been on a date
since the twelfth grade,

15:40.391 --> 15:43.092
and suddenly you're
booking two a day?

15:43.127 --> 15:45.094
Aria, it's just coffee.

15:45.129 --> 15:48.264
I'm just saying there's only so
much caffeine a woman can take.

15:48.299 --> 15:51.267
And I will be sure
to order decaf.

15:51.302 --> 15:56.272
What happened to not wanting to add
somebody else to the equation?

15:56.307 --> 15:58.341
Well, I've broken
through that wall,

15:58.375 --> 16:00.276
and now that
I'm on the other side,

16:00.311 --> 16:02.045
I can see what's out there,

16:02.079 --> 16:05.281
and I'm willing to kiss a few
frogs to find my prince.

16:06.984 --> 16:09.185
Hey! How'd it go
with coach?

16:09.220 --> 16:11.254
Not only am I not
closing out the relay,

16:11.288 --> 16:13.957
she's not letting me swim
in the county meet.

16:13.991 --> 16:15.124
What?! Why?

16:15.159 --> 16:17.060
Because I got a "c"
on my trig test,

16:17.094 --> 16:19.062
which pushed my average
below a "b."

16:19.096 --> 16:24.334
How is knowing cosines gonna
help you with your backstroke?

16:24.368 --> 16:28.004
Uhh. I... I knew I should
have taken wood shop.

16:31.075 --> 16:34.177
Paige, you are
an amazing swimmer.

16:34.211 --> 16:36.145
And you're already
being recruited.

16:39.049 --> 16:43.052
How about you come to my house
tonight and we'll watch a movie?

16:43.087 --> 16:44.287
Sure.

16:44.321 --> 16:48.291
As long as you don't
make me watch <i>rud</i> again.

16:48.325 --> 16:50.159
What time are you getting off?

16:50.194 --> 16:54.264
Five, but I promised Hanna
I would go shopping with her.

16:54.298 --> 16:56.399
So, how about we say eight?

16:56.433 --> 16:58.234
I'll pick up the Chinese.

16:59.503 --> 17:01.037
Feeling better?

17:01.071 --> 17:02.372
Not really.

17:06.977 --> 17:08.144
How about now?

17:08.178 --> 17:09.979
Little bit.

17:13.050 --> 17:14.317
And now?

17:14.351 --> 17:16.118
Getting there.

17:19.022 --> 17:20.156
I have to get back to work.

17:20.190 --> 17:22.959
Oh, darn.

17:22.992 --> 17:24.127
I'll s you tonight.

19:31.355 --> 19:33.256
This is definitely the spot.

19:40.230 --> 19:42.131
It's nothing.

19:43.434 --> 19:45.168
All right, come on.

20:23.624 --> 20:25.425
Can I help you?

20:52.720 --> 20:55.788
Looks like the beer pong
got out of control.

20:55.823 --> 20:59.459
There's no way Maya wanted
to meet me at this place.

20:59.493 --> 21:02.729
Well, we're here now,
so let's just look around.

21:17.444 --> 21:18.645
Who's that?

21:18.679 --> 21:22.548
That's just one of
the many men my mom's juggling.

21:22.583 --> 21:23.850
You should go say hello.

21:23.884 --> 21:26.853
Do I have to?

21:26.887 --> 21:29.789
Well, he's looking
right at you.

21:39.500 --> 21:41.768
Hi.
Aria, good to see ya.

21:41.802 --> 21:43.569
Oh, that's a cool shirt.

21:43.604 --> 21:45.772
Thanks. Yeah,
I love the clash.

21:45.806 --> 21:49.509
Me too. My mom actually
saw them live in concert.

21:49.543 --> 21:51.678
Oh, yeah? I bet
that was a good show.

21:51.712 --> 21:55.682
Hey, look, I'm sorry you
walked in on me and your mom.

21:55.716 --> 21:59.752
It's not really the way I wanted to meet
the daughter of the woman I'm dating.

21:59.787 --> 22:04.857
Yeah, it's just I've never seen
her kiss anyone but my dad.

22:04.892 --> 22:07.760
Yeah. My parents got divorced
when I was fifteen,

22:07.795 --> 22:09.529
so I know the feeling.

22:09.563 --> 22:11.698
I didn't want any men
around my mom,

22:11.732 --> 22:13.633
it was like nobody
was good enough for her.

22:13.667 --> 22:15.702
Yeah.

22:16.837 --> 22:20.673
Well, for the record,
I think your mom's... Awesome.

22:20.708 --> 22:22.608
She's really funny.

22:22.643 --> 22:24.410
Funny.

22:24.445 --> 22:27.747
Okay, I'm sure you say that
about all of your girlfriends.

22:27.781 --> 22:30.650
"Girlfriends"?

22:30.684 --> 22:33.886
Yeah, no. I'm not
seeing anybody else.

22:33.921 --> 22:37.590
Just enjoying spending time
with your mom.

22:37.624 --> 22:39.625
Hmm. Well...

22:39.660 --> 22:42.829
I can see why she
likes you so much.

22:42.863 --> 22:45.465
Oh, but for the record,

22:45.499 --> 22:48.634
if you hurt her, I will
crush your scones.

22:48.669 --> 22:50.770
Understood.

23:03.817 --> 23:05.651
Did you find anything?

23:05.686 --> 23:08.788
Nothing but stale nachos
and deer heads.

23:08.822 --> 23:11.457
God, this place creeps me out.

23:11.492 --> 23:12.825
Yeah. Let's go.

23:15.729 --> 23:17.530
Hold on one second.

23:26.774 --> 23:28.908
Em, there's another door here.

23:49.730 --> 23:51.864
Looks like someone's
been staying here.

24:04.645 --> 24:06.679
Em.

24:06.713 --> 24:10.416
Oh, my God.
That's Maya's bag.

24:20.561 --> 24:22.662
For protection?

24:22.696 --> 24:25.498
I don't think
she was gutting fish.

24:25.532 --> 24:27.600
Who's l.J.?

24:27.634 --> 24:29.468
No idea.

24:32.573 --> 24:35.474
Why would she have this?

24:35.509 --> 24:39.612
I gave this to Ali
for her fourteenth birthday.

24:39.646 --> 24:43.816
Maya must have found it
in the box of Ali's things.

24:51.558 --> 24:52.792
Em.

24:58.665 --> 25:00.600
Maya never left Rosewood.

25:23.457 --> 25:25.458
Who's out there?

25:27.831 --> 25:28.721
What do you want?!

25:32.337 --> 25:34.983
If this is you, Noel,
this isn't funny anymore!

26:36.238 --> 26:37.252
You're not gonna believe this,

26:37.271 --> 26:41.040
but I think Noel Kahn just sent me
the security footage from his cabin

26:41.075 --> 26:43.476
the night that Maya died.

26:50.117 --> 26:52.385
So, how did
your coffee date go?

26:52.419 --> 26:56.222
Drip, drip, drip.

26:56.256 --> 26:59.258
I don't know why you bother
going out with other guys.

26:59.293 --> 27:02.128
Zack is...
Is pretty great.

27:02.162 --> 27:05.031
So I have your approval?

27:05.065 --> 27:08.134
It helps that
he is totally into you.

27:08.168 --> 27:11.037
And what makes you think this?

27:11.071 --> 27:13.239
He might have mentioned it.

27:13.273 --> 27:15.475
And I might have said that
you felt the same way.

27:15.509 --> 27:19.011
Aria! I'm sorry, but this
is new territory for me.

27:19.046 --> 27:21.280
I mean, he basically said
he's only got eyes for you.

27:21.315 --> 27:25.017
What I am I supposed to say? "Sorry,
buddy, don't get your hopes up.

27:25.052 --> 27:28.221
My mom is dating half
of Rosewood." Shhh!

27:28.255 --> 27:30.323
He really said that?
Yes.

27:31.358 --> 27:33.459
Look, I just think

27:33.494 --> 27:36.095
that if you see this
going somewhere,

27:36.130 --> 27:39.098
you should just be straight
with him before it's too late.

27:39.133 --> 27:40.433
I will, I will.

27:40.467 --> 27:42.468
I just have to move
at my own pace.

27:42.503 --> 27:45.238
I need to feel comfortable.

27:45.272 --> 27:49.308
Trust me, there were so many things your
father and I didn't know about each other

27:49.343 --> 27:51.477
when we got married.

28:00.287 --> 28:02.989
There's no reception!

28:04.124 --> 28:06.993
I think whoever it was
just left.

28:07.027 --> 28:09.095
So what do we do now?
I don't know, scream?

28:09.129 --> 28:12.465
What good is that gonna do?
There's nobody around for Miles!

28:12.499 --> 28:14.333
Hey, do you see that light?

28:20.140 --> 28:21.140
Geez, em!

28:26.213 --> 28:27.346
They're locked!

28:32.386 --> 28:34.020
Aaaah!
Oh, God!

28:34.054 --> 28:36.189
Are you okay?
I cut my leg.

28:36.223 --> 28:38.491
Oh, my God, you're bleeding!

28:44.431 --> 28:46.299
It's gonna be okay. Wait.

28:48.168 --> 28:50.369
Oh! I'm gonna be sick.

29:02.182 --> 29:03.382
Okay.

29:03.417 --> 29:05.117
It'll be okay.

29:05.152 --> 29:06.219
Come on.

29:17.197 --> 29:19.265
Oh, my God.

29:33.234 --> 29:34.606
We need to take you to the hospital.

29:34.625 --> 29:37.527
No. No. 'Cause then I have to
tell my mom how I got this cut.

29:37.561 --> 29:42.198
It's not a cut, it's a stab wound.
You need to get stitches.

29:42.233 --> 29:46.169
Maybe we should call Caleb. You
know I can't talk to him right now.

29:46.203 --> 29:49.506
We have to do something. I'm not
gonna let you bleed to death.

29:49.540 --> 29:52.542
What are you doing?

29:54.645 --> 29:56.613
Hey. It's Emily.

29:59.450 --> 30:01.384
So you gonna tell me
how you did this?

30:01.418 --> 30:04.521
I told you. I was cutting a
carrot and the knife slipped.

30:04.555 --> 30:06.623
And made a gash this big.
It was a big carrot.

30:06.657 --> 30:08.391
Why didn't you just
go to the hospital?

30:08.425 --> 30:11.327
This is gonna sound crazy,
and...

30:11.362 --> 30:13.429
I want to talk about it,
but I can't.

30:13.464 --> 30:16.232
It's just...
Not the right time.

30:16.267 --> 30:19.202
Hanna, are you in some
kind of trouble? No.

30:19.236 --> 30:22.372
All right, no more questions.
Thank you.

30:22.406 --> 30:23.673
All right.

30:23.707 --> 30:27.210
This is gonna help
with the swelling,

30:27.244 --> 30:29.479
but you're gonna need to sleep
with your leg elevated,

30:29.513 --> 30:32.682
so sleep with a pillow
or something under it, okay?

30:32.716 --> 30:34.651
Have you eaten dinner?

30:34.685 --> 30:39.455
Uh, the last meal I've had
was a rice cake and a yoo-hoo.

30:39.490 --> 30:43.560
So with that big carrot you hit
all your basic food groups.

30:43.594 --> 30:47.330
I'm gonna give you some antibiotics, but you
shouldn't take them on an empty stomach.

30:47.364 --> 30:49.732
All right? So...

30:53.571 --> 30:56.272
Three eggs, two meatballs,

30:56.307 --> 30:58.541
and a pint of milk.

30:58.576 --> 31:00.743
A challenge, but I'm up for it.

31:12.456 --> 31:16.392
I want to apologize for the way
I acted at the brew earlier.

31:17.661 --> 31:19.596
You don't have to
apologize to me.

31:19.630 --> 31:23.399
I do. I've never
behaved like that before.

31:23.434 --> 31:25.535
I don't know what came over me.

31:25.569 --> 31:28.404
Jenna was a jerk
for blowing you off.

31:28.439 --> 31:32.275
It had nothing to do with Jenna.
I barely know the girl.

31:32.309 --> 31:36.646
I think losing Maya is having more
of an effect on me than I realized.

31:36.680 --> 31:40.450
I just can't seem to get past
the fact that she's gone

31:40.484 --> 31:43.519
and that's there's nothing
I can do to bring her back.

31:43.554 --> 31:47.257
Yeah. I feel
the same way.

31:54.431 --> 31:56.599
This bag...

31:56.634 --> 31:58.701
It's Maya's.

31:58.736 --> 32:02.472
I saw a photo she sent me
in an old email account.

32:02.506 --> 32:06.276
It was dated a few days
before she died.

32:07.544 --> 32:10.280
I recognized the cabin
that was in that picture,

32:10.314 --> 32:14.517
and Hanna and I went there
today and we found this.

32:14.551 --> 32:19.222
I think she was staying there from
the time she ran away up until...

32:19.256 --> 32:20.556
You know.

32:23.360 --> 32:27.697
She wore this at a bonfire we had
at the beach a few summers ago.

33:35.499 --> 33:38.368
I've wanted to kiss you
for a while.

33:44.308 --> 33:48.277
I haven't felt this close
to someone in a long time.

34:32.255 --> 34:34.424
Are you making popcorn?

34:36.427 --> 34:39.328
No, but I...
I could.

34:39.362 --> 34:43.132
No, no. I just thought that
that's why you were getting up.

34:43.167 --> 34:45.333
I'm actually kind of tired.

34:45.369 --> 34:48.371
Is there any way we could
finish this up another night?

34:53.577 --> 34:56.379
Are we still fighting
without actually fighting?

34:56.413 --> 34:58.214
No.

34:58.248 --> 35:01.417
Look, I'm so sorry for
the way I acted this morning.

35:01.452 --> 35:04.387
Your past is your past,

35:04.421 --> 35:07.156
and I should have
respected that,

35:07.191 --> 35:08.524
I shouldn't have
pushed you so hard.

35:08.559 --> 35:12.462
Look, I'm okay...
I found Maggie.

35:12.496 --> 35:15.565
What?
She lives in Delaware.

35:15.599 --> 35:18.267
Did you call her?

35:18.302 --> 35:19.469
Not yet.

36:21.655 --> 36:24.690
Hey. Hey. I hope I didn't screw
up your night with Ezra.

36:24.725 --> 36:26.592
No, it was already screwed up.

36:26.627 --> 36:28.761
Why would Noel
give you this video?

36:28.796 --> 36:31.430
I'm starting to
get an idea. Watch.

36:34.501 --> 36:35.802
Oh, my God, that's Maya.

36:35.836 --> 36:38.538
Yeah. And look at
the time on the video.

36:38.572 --> 36:41.440
Now look at
Garrett's case file.

36:42.676 --> 36:44.744
"Key witness in the case
against Garrett

36:44.778 --> 36:48.514
places him in the car with Maya
at... Nine P.M."

36:50.617 --> 36:55.421
But that means... that Garrett was not
the last person to see Maya alive.

36:55.455 --> 36:56.789
What...

37:15.542 --> 37:17.710
hi.
Hi.

37:17.744 --> 37:19.579
I was just in the area,

37:19.613 --> 37:22.648
and I thought I might stop by and
see if you wanted to have a drink.

37:22.683 --> 37:24.550
Absolutely. Yeah.

37:24.585 --> 37:27.820
I was just stocking some stuff for
tomorrow, sit wherever you want.

37:33.493 --> 37:36.462
Aria tell you
I ran into her this afternoon?

37:36.496 --> 37:37.797
She mentioned it,

37:37.831 --> 37:41.467
and she also mentioned
the conversation you had,

37:41.501 --> 37:44.704
which is sort of
the reason why I'm here.

37:45.806 --> 37:48.341
Um.......

37:48.375 --> 37:50.676
I don't know how to say this,
so I'm just gonna say it.

37:50.711 --> 37:54.447
Um... I've been
dating other guys

37:54.481 --> 37:57.350
while we've been
seeing each other,

37:57.384 --> 38:00.586
and I was under the impression
that you were too.

38:00.621 --> 38:03.456
Dating guys?
Women.

38:03.490 --> 38:05.291
Oh.

38:05.325 --> 38:07.593
Uh, no.
Just you.

38:09.563 --> 38:11.697
I find that hard to believe.

38:11.732 --> 38:13.499
And why is that?

38:13.533 --> 38:16.402
Because you're gorgeous
and young

38:16.436 --> 38:19.305
and you have a very full life
ahead of you,

38:19.339 --> 38:21.674
and I've kind of
already lived one.

38:21.708 --> 38:24.543
You're only a couple of years
older than me. Try ten.

38:30.817 --> 38:33.519
Ella, you're interesting...

38:33.553 --> 38:36.756
And smart... And sexy.

38:39.393 --> 38:42.528
Do you have any idea how hard those
qualities are to find in someone?

38:42.562 --> 38:45.564
At any age? But I know
you're recently divorced,

38:45.599 --> 38:48.534
so if you feel like
you need to date other guys

38:48.568 --> 38:51.404
and see what else is out
there... I... no, no.

38:51.438 --> 38:53.739
It's not that.
I just... it's...

38:53.774 --> 38:55.808
it's just what?

38:55.842 --> 39:00.479
I just I didn't expect to meet
someone that I liked so much

39:00.514 --> 39:02.782
at this point in my life.

39:07.354 --> 39:10.523
I'm not asking you
to move in or anything,

39:10.557 --> 39:13.726
but, uh, I think
we should give this a shot.

39:22.336 --> 39:24.337
I mentioned how sexy you are,
right?

39:24.371 --> 39:25.671
No.
No?

39:31.678 --> 39:34.347
<i>Good to see you
still have your appetite.</i>

39:36.516 --> 39:37.717
Where are you going?

39:37.751 --> 39:39.518
To put my leg up.

39:39.553 --> 39:41.754
Here. Hold onto me.

39:42.823 --> 39:44.590
There we go.

39:45.759 --> 39:47.593
That's it.

39:56.770 --> 39:58.671
Hanna...

40:05.679 --> 40:08.447
Look, it's getting really late.

40:08.482 --> 40:10.483
You should probably go.

40:14.621 --> 40:16.589
You really saved me tonight.

40:20.594 --> 40:21.861
Anytime.

40:41.615 --> 40:43.883
Hey. How ya feelin'?
Hey.

40:43.917 --> 40:47.420
A little bit better.
Good. What was wrong?

40:47.454 --> 40:49.889
I got sick to my stomach.

40:49.923 --> 40:52.525
You seemed fine yesterday.

40:52.559 --> 40:54.827
Yeah, it just kind of
came on suddenly.

40:54.861 --> 40:57.830
How was your night?

40:57.864 --> 40:59.765
Intense.

40:59.800 --> 41:02.768
Um, Maya's cousin came by.

41:02.803 --> 41:04.737
Nate?
Yeah.

41:04.771 --> 41:07.573
Heas really upset.

41:07.607 --> 41:09.742
More like a total mess,
actually.

41:09.776 --> 41:12.578
Kind of like how I was
the other night.

41:12.612 --> 41:14.713
So what'd you guys do?

41:15.816 --> 41:18.751
Talked, mostly.
Mostly?

41:22.722 --> 41:24.723
Let's go, ladies.
Time to hit the pool.

41:32.599 --> 41:35.468
You need to see this.

41:37.804 --> 41:41.674
Wait. Noel was there
that night?

41:56.790 --> 42:00.459
So they were still together then.
Yeah. Keep watching.

42:27.320 --> 42:28.487
Oh, my God.

42:28.522 --> 42:30.222
What the hell just happened?

42:30.257 --> 42:31.490
Look.

42:39.399 --> 42:42.401
Han, that could not have been Jenna or Noel.
They just went inside.

42:42.435 --> 42:44.336
Then it must have been Garrett.
It can't be.

42:44.371 --> 42:46.338
He was arrested at my house
at midnight.

42:46.373 --> 42:50.709
So what does that mean? It means
that none of them killed Maya.

43:03.356 --> 43:05.457
