06:13.624 --> 06:15.250
as someone who used
to work there.

06:15.292 --> 06:17.920
It is a cesspool,

Well, then I wouldn't recommend
sharing a towel with her.

06:41.110 --> 06:43.403
My point, boychik,
is that Red Oaks

06:43.445 --> 06:45.405

different caliber

on the hourly rate

06:48.575 --> 06:50.160

you'd be hard-pressed

06:59.086 --> 07:00.754

09:50.757 --> 09:53.510
the word "cow" should not be
anywhere near that sentence.

09:53.552 --> 09:55.887
-Okay. My mistake.
-Just saying.

09:55.929 --> 09:58.015
-Let me make it up to you.
-What's this?

the gesture,

10:07.149 --> 10:10.527
but I'm laying off
the sauce for a bit.

10:10.569 --> 10:11.737
Really?

10:11.778 --> 10:13.447
Okay.

10:13.488 --> 10:15.032
Well, forget that.

10:15.073 --> 10:17.409
And let's just, uh,
step into my office.

10:17.451 --> 10:18.410
(chuckles)

10:18.452 --> 10:21.621
So, um...

10:21.663 --> 10:22.622
Yeah.

10:22.664 --> 10:24.666
Wow.

10:27.169 --> 10:28.420
What are you doing?
What's the matter?

10:28.462 --> 10:30.297
Promise you won't get mad?

10:30.339 --> 10:32.758
Okay, you have my interest.

10:32.799 --> 10:33.967
What?

10:34.009 --> 10:35.594
(exhales)

10:35.635 --> 10:38.305
I had to sell the watch
you bought me in Paris.

10:38.347 --> 10:40.223
Why would you do that?

10:40.265 --> 10:41.767
We need the cash.

10:41.808 --> 10:44.227
In fact, I've been thinking,

10:44.269 --> 10:50.067
I think it's time that,
you know, I get a job.

10:50.108 --> 10:52.444
Whoa-whoa, what--
no, what-- doing what?

10:52.486 --> 10:54.154
-Pharmaceutical sales.
-(scoffs)

10:54.196 --> 10:58.408
-My sister says I can make
60 to 70 grand a year. -No.

10:58.450 --> 11:00.035
No, no, absolutely not.

11:00.077 --> 11:01.244
No, I forbid it.

11:01.286 --> 11:02.454
Oh, you "forbid it"?

11:02.496 --> 11:04.164
-I...
-(laughs softly)

11:04.206 --> 11:06.249
Sweetie, call my lawyer,

11:06.291 --> 11:08.251
and just tell him how much
you need to tide you over,

11:08.293 --> 11:10.545
and then he'll wire some money
into the joint account.

11:10.587 --> 11:12.381
-What money?
-Yeah, well...

11:12.422 --> 11:15.926
I have some emergency funds
squirrelled away.

11:15.967 --> 11:17.344
Where?

11:17.386 --> 11:18.595
Here and there.

11:18.637 --> 11:20.222
Eh, those two places.

11:21.473 --> 11:23.850
It's gonna be okay. Listen.

11:23.892 --> 11:26.353
In two months,
I have my parole hearing.

11:26.395 --> 11:27.979
-And then, once
I'm out of here... -(sighs)

11:28.021 --> 11:31.650
...we'll just put
this whole thing behind us.

11:31.691 --> 11:32.818
Don't panic.

11:32.859 --> 11:33.985
Can we fuck now?

11:35.237 --> 11:36.446
Yeah, I guess so.

11:36.488 --> 11:37.447
That's the spirit.

11:37.489 --> 11:39.074
(both laugh)

11:39.116 --> 11:42.619
(music playing,
rhythmic clapping)

11:42.661 --> 11:46.248

11:46.289 --> 11:50.419

12:01.972 --> 12:03.640
Mm, yeah.

12:05.392 --> 12:07.978
The Spirit was with you
today, Sam.

12:08.019 --> 12:09.646
Well, thank you, sir.

12:09.688 --> 12:11.773
You really should join us
for Bible study sometime.

12:11.815 --> 12:13.191
You know, I would.

12:13.233 --> 12:15.360
But I think if I did convert,

12:15.402 --> 12:18.613
my dad might crawl out of his
grave at B'nai Israel Cemetery

12:18.655 --> 12:20.073
and strangle me to death.

12:20.115 --> 12:21.491
(laughter)

12:21.533 --> 12:23.285
CHOIR MEMBER (laughing):
Have a good night.

12:23.326 --> 12:24.494
TERRY:
Mm.

12:24.536 --> 12:26.538
How's the sandwich?

12:26.580 --> 12:28.248
Most delicious thing
I've ever put in my mouth.

12:28.290 --> 12:29.749
No, no, no.
Really, really, how is it?

12:29.791 --> 12:31.126
Swear on my mama's wig.

12:31.168 --> 12:33.086
It's the only thing
I can do not to weep.

12:33.128 --> 12:34.296
-Really?
-Mm-hmm.

12:34.337 --> 12:36.548
You know what my secret is?

12:36.590 --> 12:39.259
Sun-dried tomatoes.
I chop them up real fine,

12:39.301 --> 12:41.261
and then I mix them in
with the mayonnaise.

12:41.303 --> 12:43.305
How'd you come up with that?

12:43.346 --> 12:46.725
I don't know, I read cookbooks
in the bathroom.

12:46.766 --> 12:48.518
Well, you're an artist.

12:48.560 --> 12:50.604
I didn't think you could top
last week's muffaletta,

12:50.645 --> 12:53.023
but you did.

12:53.064 --> 12:55.192
You know, it's funny.

12:55.233 --> 12:56.735
When I first got divorced,
I thought I would

12:56.776 --> 12:59.154
hate cooking for myself,
but turns out, I love it.

12:59.196 --> 13:00.363
Hmm.

13:00.405 --> 13:02.115
You're a regular Frugal Gourmet.

13:02.157 --> 13:03.325
Eh.

13:03.366 --> 13:05.243
Sis, you ready to go?

13:05.285 --> 13:07.871
Oh, I still have to organize
these hymnals

13:07.913 --> 13:10.457
and get all these robes
put away.

13:10.499 --> 13:11.875
Well, I got to get home.

13:11.917 --> 13:14.461
'Cause Laverne
is at a PTA meeting,

13:14.503 --> 13:17.380
and I don't trust
Junior home alone.

13:17.422 --> 13:19.299
-He might burn the house down.
-SAM: Well, you know,

13:19.341 --> 13:21.134
I'm not in a rush. I could
stick around and help you out,

13:21.176 --> 13:23.094
you know, give you a lift home.

13:23.136 --> 13:25.597
Oh, that's kind of you, Sam,
but I don't want to be a bother.

13:25.639 --> 13:27.182
No, no problem.

13:27.224 --> 13:29.559
-Are you sure? -Yeah. Yeah,
go on, get out of here.

13:29.601 --> 13:30.769
-Ah.
-I'll see you at the office.

13:30.810 --> 13:31.853
Thanks, buddy.

13:31.895 --> 13:33.855
Sis. Mwah. See you later, yeah?

13:33.897 --> 13:35.273
SHIRLEY:
All right, bye, bye.

13:42.072 --> 13:43.740
(chuckles)

13:49.621 --> 13:51.164
You think he suspects anything?

13:51.206 --> 13:52.707
Mm-mm, nope.

13:52.749 --> 13:54.709
You think we should tell him?

13:54.751 --> 13:56.836
Uh, eventually.

13:56.878 --> 13:58.630
Why, you think it's a bad idea?

13:58.672 --> 14:01.883
Well, he's usually
a little overprotective

14:01.925 --> 14:03.510
of me and my sister.

14:03.552 --> 14:05.345
Once, he tried
to run over my ex-husband

14:05.387 --> 14:07.305
after he found out
he was cheating on me.

14:09.015 --> 14:10.684
You know what?
Let's not tell him.

14:10.725 --> 14:12.727
(both laugh)

14:17.065 --> 14:19.067
(men speaking Japanese)

14:33.164 --> 14:34.749
DIRECTOR: We need to get through
about 30 shots a day,

14:34.791 --> 14:37.127
and I told you about 150 times

14:37.168 --> 14:39.796
that I really want
a crane to boom down.

14:39.838 --> 14:41.631
Right when the band comes in,
I want there to be smoke.

14:41.673 --> 14:43.341
Look, I'm not trying to scare
the audience away, you know?

14:43.383 --> 14:45.135
It's like, something where
it's like... in your face,

14:45.176 --> 14:46.678
-Yeah, right.
-But also

14:46.720 --> 14:49.931
-I want you to ease in,
and I want... -DEREK: You.

14:49.973 --> 14:51.725
-What are you doing right now?
-Uh, nothing.

14:51.766 --> 14:53.351
Okay, I need 25 mannequins.

14:53.393 --> 14:55.937
-Sorry? -Do you need me
to write it down?

14:55.979 --> 14:57.564
Maybe you can read lips, here:

14:57.606 --> 15:01.109
25 mannequins, female.

15:01.151 --> 15:03.153
And make sure they're silver.

15:03.194 --> 15:04.404
Right now we're
in a music video...

15:04.446 --> 15:06.656
Derek? Derek? Uh...

15:06.698 --> 15:08.450
-Derek, wh-where do I get them?
-I'm sorry.

15:08.491 --> 15:10.702
Were you a crack baby
or are you just retarded?

15:10.744 --> 15:13.371
How should I know
where to find mannequins?

15:13.413 --> 15:16.124
Do I look like a tailor? No.

15:16.166 --> 15:18.376
Now get on it before I find
something more intelligent

15:18.418 --> 15:20.962
to replace you with,
like an aloe plant.

15:21.004 --> 15:22.672
Throwing it in the faces
of the audience.

15:22.714 --> 15:24.549
We're trying
to work this thing together,

15:24.591 --> 15:25.800
and I feel like...

15:27.052 --> 15:29.054
Who's this guy?

15:32.182 --> 15:33.391
(grunts softly)

15:38.647 --> 15:42.359
(exhaling sharply)

15:42.400 --> 15:44.027
NASH:
Hey. After you. Go ahead, yeah.

15:44.069 --> 15:45.320
MISTY:
Nash!

15:45.362 --> 15:46.571
My dear.

15:46.613 --> 15:48.573
(laughing):
Hi.

15:48.615 --> 15:50.033
Oh, look at you, like Bo Derek.

15:50.075 --> 15:51.159
(both laugh)

15:51.201 --> 15:52.577
Ah. Good to see you.

15:52.619 --> 15:53.953
-Good to see you.
-Mm-hmm.

15:53.995 --> 15:55.622
How you doing? You flossing?

15:55.664 --> 15:57.874
-Every day. I love it!
-Good boy.

15:57.916 --> 15:59.751
And you've got a graduation
coming up, is that correct?

15:59.793 --> 16:01.086
Yeah, yeah, in August.

16:01.127 --> 16:02.545
Yeah, I finished
all my coursework.

16:02.587 --> 16:04.422
All I have left
is 30 hours of observation

16:04.464 --> 16:06.800
at a dental practice,
then I'm done.

16:06.841 --> 16:08.968
I assume you have
some grand plans to celebrate.

16:09.010 --> 16:10.762
Uh, you know, I mean,
Wheeler and I have been talking

16:10.804 --> 16:12.389
-about going away
for a few days. -Oh!

16:12.430 --> 16:15.016
But the truth is,
we're so broke from school.

16:15.058 --> 16:16.476
-Ah, yes. Huh.
-So...

16:16.518 --> 16:18.395
-Mm-hmm.
-Yeah. Uh, you know,

16:18.436 --> 16:19.854
I should probably get ready
to teach my tadpole class.

16:19.896 --> 16:22.065
-Of course.
-Catch you later.

16:22.107 --> 16:23.274
-Yes.
-All right.

16:23.316 --> 16:24.401
Uh, uh, Misty.

16:24.442 --> 16:26.986
Uh, might I ask you

16:27.028 --> 16:28.738
a small question, please?

16:28.780 --> 16:32.909
Have you, have you noticed
an inordinate number of, uh...

16:32.951 --> 16:37.163
uh, uh, Japanese gentlemen
about the club recently?

16:37.205 --> 16:38.331
-Japanese gentlemen?
-Mm-hmm.

16:38.373 --> 16:39.958
Um, no.

16:39.999 --> 16:41.126
Why?

16:41.167 --> 16:42.877
No reason.

16:42.919 --> 16:45.130
Children, come learn.

16:45.171 --> 16:46.506
Learn to swim from the best.

16:47.632 --> 16:49.634
All right, tadpoles.

16:55.390 --> 16:56.850
I'm effed.

16:56.891 --> 16:58.518
-What's wrong?
-I need your help.

16:58.560 --> 17:00.228
Derek sent me
to find 25 mannequins,

17:00.270 --> 17:01.855
so I called
every prop house in the city.

17:01.896 --> 17:03.732
Nobody has any.

17:03.773 --> 17:06.109
So I've been to Saks, Macy's,
Barneys, Bloomingdale's.

17:06.151 --> 17:07.819
None of them are willing
to rent their mannequins,

17:07.861 --> 17:09.070
so now I'm out of ideas.

17:09.112 --> 17:11.948
What do I do?

17:11.990 --> 17:13.992
Come with me.

17:15.660 --> 17:16.995
Where you going?

17:17.036 --> 17:18.788
Garment district.

17:18.830 --> 17:19.914
Won't you get in trouble?

17:19.956 --> 17:21.082
No. Susan's on set all day.

17:21.124 --> 17:22.083
She won't even notice.

17:22.125 --> 17:23.418

How did you know about that

18:27.398 --> 18:29.025
Oh, I walk past it every day.

18:29.067 --> 18:30.360
It's right by my subway stop.

18:30.401 --> 18:31.486
Ah, where do you live again?

18:31.528 --> 18:33.196
44th and 11th.

18:33.238 --> 18:35.198
Hell's Kitchen? Oh.

18:35.240 --> 18:36.574
What?

18:36.616 --> 18:37.826
Nothing.

18:37.867 --> 18:40.912
Uh, well, my ex
is your neighbor.

18:40.954 --> 18:42.622
Or was.
She could've moved by now.

18:42.664 --> 18:45.208
Well, if she ever asks me
to borrow a cup of sugar,

18:45.250 --> 18:47.418
I will be sure to say no to her.

18:47.460 --> 18:49.003
Hmm, Skye isn't the type of girl
that does a lot of baking.

18:49.045 --> 18:50.171
-Oh, no?
-No.

18:50.213 --> 18:51.548
What kind of girl is she?

18:51.589 --> 18:53.550
She's an artist, a painter.

18:53.591 --> 18:55.093
-Oh.
-Yeah.

18:55.134 --> 18:56.344
-Hmm.
-Last I heard, she was

18:56.386 --> 18:57.554
taking classes
at The New School.

18:57.595 --> 18:59.389
So, tortured.

18:59.430 --> 19:01.558
More like complicated, you know?

19:01.599 --> 19:05.061
Like a... only child
from a messed up family.

19:05.103 --> 19:06.980
Yeah.

19:07.021 --> 19:10.024
Which, I guess,
also describes me.

19:10.066 --> 19:13.903
(laughs) You're about
the opposite of complicated.

19:13.945 --> 19:16.197
-Really?
-Yeah, I would say.

19:16.239 --> 19:18.157
That's good, I think.

19:18.199 --> 19:20.994
Do you miss her?

19:21.035 --> 19:22.370
Uh, I don't know.

19:22.412 --> 19:23.413
Sure, yeah, sometimes.

19:23.454 --> 19:24.747
-Yeah?
-But...

19:24.789 --> 19:27.542
I think by the end we both...
we kind of realized

19:27.584 --> 19:30.920
that we were just too different
from each other.

19:30.962 --> 19:32.881
I've never really bought into

19:32.922 --> 19:35.758
-that whole "opposites attract"
thing. -No?

19:35.800 --> 19:38.136
No. I just don't think it works.

19:38.177 --> 19:39.929
Long-term, at least, right?

19:39.971 --> 19:42.432
Right, well, yeah,
I'm a perfect example.

19:42.473 --> 19:44.183
(laughs)
Yeah, exactly.

19:44.225 --> 19:45.226
Can I have a drag?

19:45.268 --> 19:47.270
Thank you.

19:47.312 --> 19:49.188
So, what happened
with the bagel shop hottie?

19:49.230 --> 19:51.733
Oh, it didn't happen.
She stood me up.

19:51.774 --> 19:53.943
-You're kidding. -No.
I had a very good time alone.

19:53.985 --> 19:55.904
Oh, my God!

19:55.945 --> 19:57.155
That is so rude.

19:57.196 --> 19:58.573
Yeah, it's no big deal.

19:58.615 --> 19:59.991
I'm not sure how serious
it could've gone

20:00.033 --> 20:01.284
about a girl
with so many tattoos.

20:01.326 --> 20:03.077
You know? I mean...

20:03.119 --> 20:04.829
we wouldn't have been able
to be buried together

20:04.871 --> 20:06.331
at a Jewish cemetery.

20:08.374 --> 20:09.876
It's a joke.

20:09.918 --> 20:11.586
You don't have Jews back
in Nebraska, do you?

20:11.628 --> 20:14.005
No, we-we do, we do.

20:14.047 --> 20:15.423
-You do?
-We do. Yes.

20:15.465 --> 20:16.841
The Rubens.

20:16.883 --> 20:19.093
-The Ru... (laughs)
-Mm-hmm.

20:19.135 --> 20:20.803
The Rubens?

20:20.845 --> 20:22.931
Well, hey, if you tell me
what kind of person

20:22.972 --> 20:24.307
you're interested in,
I can set you up

20:24.349 --> 20:25.642
with one of my single
girlfriends.

20:25.683 --> 20:27.352
-Really?
-Yeah.

20:27.393 --> 20:29.270
Hey.

20:29.312 --> 20:31.314
Noah. Hey.

20:31.356 --> 20:32.690
What are you doing here?

20:32.732 --> 20:35.485
Uh, I was, uh, on my way
back to our place.

20:35.526 --> 20:37.904
Figured I'd swing by
and surprise you.

20:37.946 --> 20:40.865
Uh, do you want to grab
dinner somewhere?

20:40.907 --> 20:43.368
Yes, yes, I do.

20:43.409 --> 20:44.619
I'm Noah, by the way.

20:44.661 --> 20:46.204
Oh, hey, yeah, I-I'm David.

20:46.245 --> 20:48.122
-Great to finally meet you.
-David. Pleasure's mine.

20:48.164 --> 20:50.583
Uh, you're welcome to join us
if you'd like.

20:50.625 --> 20:52.043
Oh, that's very kind.

20:52.085 --> 20:53.795
Um, I've got to get these
back to set, but thank you.

20:53.836 --> 20:58.466
I'm not even gonna ask.
(laughs)

20:58.508 --> 20:59.801
Thank you for, uh...
she saved my ass.

20:59.842 --> 21:01.594
Uh, thank you so much.
You're great.

21:01.636 --> 21:02.887
Anytime.

21:02.929 --> 21:04.305
Nice to meet you.

21:04.347 --> 21:05.848
Yeah, you, too.

21:41.884 --> 21:44.095
Are you trying to give me
my third heart attack?

21:44.137 --> 21:45.555
I'm sorry, Herb.

21:45.596 --> 21:47.181
I don't know what kind
of funny business

21:47.223 --> 21:50.351
goes on in Turkish baths,
but in this country,

21:50.393 --> 21:53.604
we don't play hide-and-seek
with our shvanz out.

21:53.646 --> 21:55.481
Oh, dear, sorry.

21:55.523 --> 21:58.693
My cousin Mehmet suffered from
hallucinations, but then again,

21:58.735 --> 22:01.279
he was hit in the head with
a cricket ball as a child.

22:01.320 --> 22:02.989
(sniffs)

22:03.031 --> 22:05.992
Those Japanese fellas sure
like their aftershave.

22:06.034 --> 22:07.118
You've seen them, too?

22:07.160 --> 22:09.037
Oh, saw 'em
on the golf course earlier.

22:09.078 --> 22:10.371
Who are they?

22:10.413 --> 22:15.251
The rumor is they're trying
to buy the club.

22:18.880 --> 22:20.506
(quietly):
What?

22:20.548 --> 22:22.383
DEREK: All right, put a fan
on the other side.

22:22.425 --> 22:24.469
We got to move the smoke around
'cause he has asthma.

22:24.510 --> 22:25.678
Just set him up, okay?
He gets...

22:25.720 --> 22:26.679
-DAVID: Hey, Derek.
-What?

22:26.721 --> 22:28.931
Mission accomplished.

22:30.808 --> 22:32.143
The rest are still in the van.

22:32.185 --> 22:33.519
Spray paint is still wet
on a few of them.

22:33.561 --> 22:35.897
Should be ready by crew call
tomorrow.

22:35.938 --> 22:37.690
Oh, those, yeah.

22:37.732 --> 22:38.900
I don't need those anymore.

22:38.941 --> 22:40.109
What did you say?

22:40.151 --> 22:42.070
I don't need it anymore.

22:42.111 --> 22:44.697
The director wants to go with
live chicks with body paint.

22:44.739 --> 22:46.532
-What? -We can't use that.
That's sexist.

22:46.574 --> 22:49.786
(stammers) What do I do with...
where would you like them?

22:49.827 --> 22:51.412
DEREK: Kid, get it the fuck
out of here.

22:51.454 --> 22:52.830
Put it anywhere. Bring it home.
Put it in your closet.

22:52.872 --> 22:53.998
I don't fucking care.

22:54.040 --> 22:56.626
Funny. Very funny.

22:56.667 --> 22:59.378
Bye-bye.

22:59.420 --> 23:01.339
Take her out,

23:01.380 --> 23:03.508

Why are we even considering
