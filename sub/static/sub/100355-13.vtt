WEBVTT

00:04.091 --> 00:06.310
- All right, Legends, let's
get this show on the road.

00:06.354 --> 00:08.617
Can't let this immortality buzz
go to waste.

00:08.660 --> 00:11.185
- For your convenience,
I started a countdown timer.

00:11.228 --> 00:13.970
23 hours and 45 minutes
to save my brother.

00:14.014 --> 00:15.276
You're welcome.

00:15.319 --> 00:16.973
- All right,
you heard the lady.

00:17.017 --> 00:18.279
Clock is ticking.

00:18.322 --> 00:20.063
- Yeah,
let's get back to the ship

00:20.107 --> 00:21.108
and fire up the Loom
before it's too late.

00:21.151 --> 00:23.023
- Has anyone seen Gary?

00:23.066 --> 00:25.416
Because someone at your party
has stolen my Shadow Stone.

00:25.460 --> 00:28.028
So if you come across
a disembodied voice

00:28.071 --> 00:30.160
floating around,
crying out like a baby,

00:30.204 --> 00:31.292
then that's your culprit.

00:31.335 --> 00:32.641
- Yeah, Gary went back
to the ship.

00:32.684 --> 00:34.251
His Bunny has IBS.

00:34.295 --> 00:38.081
- Yeah, and serious gas issues.

00:40.388 --> 00:41.693
- Ooh.

00:41.737 --> 00:45.349
Wow, that is some arctic breeze
blowing in.

00:45.393 --> 00:47.090
- Why are we in England?

00:47.134 --> 00:49.223
- Where the bloody hell's
the portal?

00:49.266 --> 00:53.096
Has anyone seen Astra?

01:07.241 --> 01:10.157
- How's your tummy,
my bunny-wummy?

01:12.811 --> 01:14.378
- Gideon,
can you do me a favor?

01:14.422 --> 01:17.294
Can you fabricate more veggies
for Gary Junior Two?

01:20.558 --> 01:22.604
- Gideon, you there?

01:23.866 --> 01:26.173
Huh.

01:26.216 --> 01:27.174
- Gary,
the ship's compromised.

01:27.217 --> 01:29.132
They're shutting me down--

01:34.268 --> 01:39.142
- If Gideon is down,
then who's flying the ship?

01:39.186 --> 01:40.622
- Oh, come on,
are you not off your trolleys?

01:40.665 --> 01:43.103
I mean, why would Astra steal
the Waverider, eh?

01:43.146 --> 01:44.147
- I know we're "friends"
with her now,

01:44.191 --> 01:45.931
but maybe she wanted
to use the Loom.

01:45.975 --> 01:47.324
- Or what if my sister's
got to her?

01:47.368 --> 01:49.196
- If they get control
of the Loom before we do,

01:49.239 --> 01:50.936
we'll never get a chance
to bring my brother back.

01:50.980 --> 01:53.069
- Okay, let's all
just keep our cool.

01:53.113 --> 01:56.159
Gideon, what's going on?

01:56.203 --> 01:58.205
Gideon?

01:58.248 --> 01:59.597
Okay, no Gideon.

01:59.641 --> 02:02.600
- Yeah, it's okay, it's okay.
We'll figure this out.

02:06.082 --> 02:08.345
What just happened?
Did you have another vision?

02:08.389 --> 02:12.349
- Uh, no, it's, um--
no, it was nothing.

02:12.393 --> 02:14.351
- As in you saw nothing,
or what?

02:14.395 --> 02:18.007
- It--it was just a--a flash,
and then it was nothing.

02:18.050 --> 02:19.226
I think it's the Chalice.

02:19.269 --> 02:21.967
It's probably messing
with my powers.

02:22.011 --> 02:24.187
- So what,
so now you're just blind?

02:24.231 --> 02:26.146
- That's not helpful.
- Come on, that's insensitive.

02:26.189 --> 02:27.408
Wait, wait, wait.

02:27.451 --> 02:30.193
I think I just came up
with an amazing plan.

02:30.237 --> 02:33.022
Rip set up Time Bureau
safe houses all over the world,

02:33.065 --> 02:34.980
some of which
are still standing--

02:35.024 --> 02:37.592
like the one in London, yes?

02:37.635 --> 02:39.202
We go there,
we get a Time Courier,

02:39.246 --> 02:40.725
it'll to take us
to the Waverider.

02:40.769 --> 02:42.205
- Yes.
- Yes.

02:42.249 --> 02:43.902
- Yeah, babe.
That is a perfect plan.

02:43.946 --> 02:45.208
And you know what?

02:45.252 --> 02:46.644
We're gonna do it,
we're gonna go to London,

02:46.688 --> 02:49.995
because we
are immortal superheroes.

02:50.039 --> 02:52.041
- Except me.
- Except for Zari.

02:52.084 --> 02:56.393
And nothing
is gonna stand in our way.

02:58.221 --> 03:00.223
We're immortal,
and we're superheroes,

03:00.267 --> 03:02.312
and we have to wait
for the bus.

03:02.356 --> 03:03.618
- Ugh.

03:03.661 --> 03:04.880
- Well, at least Constantine

03:04.923 --> 03:06.360
got us these nice,
warm clothes.

03:06.403 --> 03:07.665
We're ready
for anything, right?

03:07.709 --> 03:09.276
- Yeah, like a pheasant hunt.

03:09.319 --> 03:12.192
- But in our defense,
we do look pretty good.

03:12.235 --> 03:13.323
- Okay, tell me this.

03:13.367 --> 03:15.456
How do you live here
and not have a car?

03:15.499 --> 03:17.458
- Never needed one, love.
Always bummed a ride.

03:17.501 --> 03:20.243
- So exactly how far is it
to London?

03:20.287 --> 03:24.247
- Well, according to my phone,
it says 275.8--

03:24.291 --> 03:25.466
- Miles or kilometers?

03:25.509 --> 03:26.554
- Doesn't matter.
It's far.

03:26.597 --> 03:28.425
When is the bus supposed
to get here?

03:28.469 --> 03:29.774
- According to the schedule,

03:29.818 --> 03:33.169
it'll be here in either
one minute or three hours.

03:33.213 --> 03:34.823
- Wait.
Guys, is it a holiday?

03:34.866 --> 03:35.867
- Is it a holiday?

03:35.911 --> 03:37.434
- Ah, finally.

03:37.478 --> 03:38.435
- Yes.
- There we go.

03:38.479 --> 03:39.436
- Okay.
- Oop.

03:50.491 --> 03:52.623
- Hold up.
Why's paying the fare?

03:52.667 --> 03:54.756
- Does anyone have any money?
- No.

03:54.799 --> 03:57.889
- Uh, sir, I know
this sounds ridiculous,

03:57.933 --> 03:59.282
but the fate of the world

03:59.326 --> 04:00.544
depends on us getting
on this bus.

04:00.588 --> 04:02.807
- I don't care
who depends on who.

04:02.851 --> 04:07.116
When I'm driving this bus,
everyone pays their fare.

04:07.159 --> 04:08.378
- Have it your way.

04:11.338 --> 04:12.295
- Well, come on!

04:15.167 --> 04:16.386
- I really am so sorry, sir.

04:16.430 --> 04:18.301
Believe it or not,
we're the good guys.

04:24.612 --> 04:25.613
- Bollocks!

04:41.411 --> 04:44.632
- Thank you for delivering
this lovely timeship.

04:44.675 --> 04:46.155
And Atropos, thank you

04:46.198 --> 04:48.853
for shutting off that
aggravating talking computer.

04:48.897 --> 04:50.246
She thought she was so witty.

04:50.290 --> 04:51.987
You don't have to thank me.

04:52.030 --> 04:53.554
It's not like I had a choice.

04:53.597 --> 04:55.556
You called in your favor,
after all.

04:55.599 --> 04:57.340
- Everything comes
at a price, Astra.

04:57.384 --> 04:59.473
I gave you a shot
at killing John Constantine,

04:59.516 --> 05:01.126
and you squandered that.

05:01.170 --> 05:03.085
- You drank
from the Chalice of Dionysus.

05:03.128 --> 05:05.566
You're immortal for a day and
can operate the Loom of Fate.

05:05.609 --> 05:07.481
- Are you asking me
to work with you?

05:07.524 --> 05:11.615
Because I'm not hearing
a question.

05:11.659 --> 05:15.097
Fine, I'll join you,
but I have some demands.

05:15.140 --> 05:18.318
- Demands, really?
- Yeah.

05:18.361 --> 05:19.754
Now I've experienced life
on Earth again,

05:19.797 --> 05:22.452
some things have gotta change,
like prunes.

05:22.496 --> 05:24.585
Disgusting.
I want them gone.

05:24.628 --> 05:25.542
And dogs?

05:25.586 --> 05:27.544
They should stay puppies
forever.

05:27.588 --> 05:30.721
Oh, and there's
just one more thing.

05:30.765 --> 05:33.985
I want to bring my mother
back to life.

05:34.029 --> 05:35.073
- Let's kill her.

05:36.466 --> 05:38.294
- I'm immortal, remember?

05:38.338 --> 05:39.643
- For now.

05:39.687 --> 05:43.560
- Astra's friends will be
searching for us by now.

05:43.604 --> 05:45.693
Do something productive
and take care of them

05:45.736 --> 05:50.001
while I chat with Astra
about this list of demands.

05:51.438 --> 05:54.397
Now,
tell me about these prunes.

05:55.267 --> 05:57.052
- Um, should I tell Mick

05:57.095 --> 05:58.749
that he's driving on the wrong
side of the road, or just...

05:58.793 --> 06:01.404
- No, definitely not.
It'll just confuse him more.

06:01.448 --> 06:02.405
- Okay.

06:02.449 --> 06:03.885
- Speaking of driving,

06:03.928 --> 06:06.017
maybe you should run point
on this mission.

06:06.061 --> 06:07.584
- What?

06:07.628 --> 06:09.456
Is this because you're blind?

06:09.499 --> 06:11.153
Because you totally killed it
at beer pong.

06:11.196 --> 06:15.592
- Thank you, but now that I
can't see the future, you know,

06:15.636 --> 06:17.942
just thinking I'm maybe
more useful as a foot soldier.

06:17.986 --> 06:21.511
And plus, you're exactly
who the team needs right now.

06:21.555 --> 06:22.817
- Uh...

06:22.860 --> 06:26.211
okay, fine, but this
is only temporary,

06:26.255 --> 06:27.909
because as far
as I'm concerned,

06:27.952 --> 06:30.477
we are co-captains for life.

06:30.520 --> 06:31.608
- Always.

07:05.816 --> 07:07.905
- Oh.

07:07.949 --> 07:09.080
Who's that?

07:32.016 --> 07:34.497
- We're gonna get
your brother back.

07:34.541 --> 07:39.197
We're just taking, you know,
the scenic route.

07:41.635 --> 07:44.376
- Oh, you have got
to be kidding me.

07:44.420 --> 07:46.553
You must be joking.
What are you doing?

07:46.596 --> 07:48.729
- Oh, I'm just having a little
chin wag with an old friend.

07:48.772 --> 07:51.471
Come on, give it here--
- This is not your friend.

07:51.514 --> 07:53.603
I thought you quit.
Why are you starting again?

07:53.647 --> 07:56.301
- Because I trusted Astra,
and then she betrayed me

07:56.345 --> 07:58.652
by siding
with Charlie's sisters.

07:58.695 --> 08:00.262
You know
once they use the Loom,

08:00.305 --> 08:01.568
we're all as good as dead,
anyways.

08:01.611 --> 08:04.745
- This doomsday act
is getting super old.

08:04.788 --> 08:06.007
Look around.

08:06.050 --> 08:08.400
The sky hasn't fallen,
the world is still here,

08:08.444 --> 08:09.576
and for whatever reason,

08:09.619 --> 08:10.707
the cabal
of mystical seamstresses

08:10.751 --> 08:11.926
hasn't started spinning yet,

08:11.969 --> 08:14.885
which means we still have time
to stop them.

08:14.929 --> 08:17.540
So just don't do that.

08:17.584 --> 08:19.803
- Fine.
- So gross.

08:38.779 --> 08:40.737
- Oh, damn, Mick.
You killed her.

08:40.781 --> 08:41.869
- No, I didn't.

08:41.912 --> 08:44.567
- How do you know?
- She's moving.

08:47.744 --> 08:50.530
- Uh, uh, ma'am, maybe
you should just stay down.

08:50.573 --> 08:51.922
Are you okay?

08:53.663 --> 08:55.970
all:

08:56.013 --> 08:57.014
- What is it?

08:58.276 --> 09:00.540
- Punch it, punch it!

09:03.891 --> 09:05.022
- Nice one.

09:05.066 --> 09:07.372
Well, we've seen this before
in the forests

09:07.416 --> 09:08.983
when Atropos was chasing us.

09:09.026 --> 09:11.681
- My sister will do
everything she can to stop us.

09:11.725 --> 09:13.465
- Then we're probably
gonna start seeing

09:13.509 --> 09:14.771
a lot more
of these zombies soon.

09:14.815 --> 09:17.382
- Or now.
- Hmm?

09:33.224 --> 09:34.443
- Let's go!

10:12.916 --> 10:15.484
- Oh, come on, really?

10:15.527 --> 10:16.659
- Ew.

10:19.836 --> 10:22.273
- What the hell, John?
Now you have a death wish?

10:22.317 --> 10:23.753
- Oh, come on.
Don't be daft.

10:23.797 --> 10:25.189
See, apparently the good thing
about having a damned soul

10:25.233 --> 10:27.539
is that these zombies
aren't interested in me.

10:29.324 --> 10:30.934
- Ew, ew, ew.

10:30.978 --> 10:32.501
- Cool demo.
Can you do something now?

10:32.544 --> 10:34.764
- Yeah, okay.
Watch.

10:53.217 --> 10:55.480
- All right, team.
We gotta stick to the plan.

10:55.524 --> 10:56.656
Let's get this bus
up and running

10:56.699 --> 10:58.832
before more of these come back.

11:03.880 --> 11:06.753
- Maybe this cable
will get Gideon back online.

11:08.972 --> 11:10.060
Gideon?

11:10.104 --> 11:11.758
Oh.

11:11.801 --> 11:13.760
Should've paid more attention
in computer science.

11:22.420 --> 11:26.033
- Wake up, sleepyhead.

11:33.954 --> 11:35.738
Are you an angel?

11:35.782 --> 11:36.870
Am I dead?

11:36.913 --> 11:38.436
- Oh, you're not dead, Gary.

11:38.480 --> 11:39.829
And I'm Gideon.

11:39.873 --> 11:42.397
- You're Gideon?
- Mm-hmm.

11:42.440 --> 11:44.312
- But you're so...

11:44.355 --> 11:46.531
you're so...

11:46.575 --> 11:47.532
human.

11:47.576 --> 11:49.099
Are you real?

11:49.143 --> 11:52.450
- Well, I could explain,
but it wouldn't matter one bit.

11:52.494 --> 11:54.061
Now listen to me
very carefully,

11:54.104 --> 11:56.367
because you have
a rather important job to do.

11:56.411 --> 11:57.804
- I do?
- Yes.

11:57.847 --> 12:00.502
You must hide those very
important and powerful rings

12:00.545 --> 12:02.504
from those evil sisters.

12:02.547 --> 12:04.593
The fate the world
depends on it.

12:04.636 --> 12:07.248
Now, come on, Gary.

12:07.291 --> 12:09.990
It's time to get to work.

12:10.033 --> 12:11.905
- Guys, come on.
We've got to keep moving.

12:11.948 --> 12:13.820
What if my sister sends
something else our way?

12:13.863 --> 12:15.822
- Well, the engine's busted
after the fight,

12:15.865 --> 12:17.737
and the fuel pump's
got no power.

12:17.780 --> 12:19.260
- Even if we fix the pump,

12:19.303 --> 12:22.654
all this leaking fluid tells me
this is a lost cause.

12:22.698 --> 12:24.221
- Okay, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, relax.

12:24.265 --> 12:25.875
Remember when
we all worked together

12:25.919 --> 12:27.268
to defeat a Time Demon?

12:27.311 --> 12:29.052
We can make it to London
if we just work together.

12:29.096 --> 12:30.488
- All right,
how long is it gonna take

12:30.532 --> 12:31.707
to fix the engine?

12:31.751 --> 12:33.317
- An hour.
- Maybe two.

12:33.361 --> 12:35.319
To be honest, I don't know
anything about mechanic stuff.

12:35.363 --> 12:37.104
- All right,
we're running out of time.

12:37.147 --> 12:38.235
You live around here.

12:38.279 --> 12:39.715
You must know someone
with a car.

12:39.759 --> 12:41.108
- Uh, yeah,
I might know a bloke.

12:41.151 --> 12:42.413
- Great.

12:42.457 --> 12:43.763
- Wait, Zari,
shouldn't you stay with us?

12:43.806 --> 12:45.286
You're not immortal.

12:45.329 --> 12:47.462
-  Look, I can't
just sit here and do nothing.

12:47.505 --> 12:49.072
- What--
- Hey, hey, hey.

12:49.116 --> 12:50.595
I got her, it's fine.
- Hey, no, no, no, no, no.

12:50.639 --> 12:52.510
Where are you guys going?

12:52.554 --> 12:54.817
It's not a part of the plan.

12:54.861 --> 12:57.864
- Astra, dear, we have
been very patient with you,

12:57.907 --> 12:59.822
especially considering
you betrayed us

12:59.866 --> 13:00.997
without saying a word.

13:01.041 --> 13:02.825
- You betrayed me first.

13:02.869 --> 13:04.827
Besides, I had to take
my destiny into my own hands

13:04.871 --> 13:07.003
and try to bring
my mother back myself.

13:07.047 --> 13:09.658
- And I appreciate
your gumption,

13:09.701 --> 13:13.401
but I'm afraid you don't fully
grasp what that means.

13:13.444 --> 13:17.666
- Right now my mother is dead.
I would like her to be alive.

13:17.709 --> 13:19.233
Fairly simple concept.

13:19.276 --> 13:23.541
- But as you know, life
as a human is very difficult.

13:23.585 --> 13:27.154
If you insist on having
a normal life with your mother,

13:27.197 --> 13:29.330
you will be bound
to the rules of nature,

13:29.373 --> 13:32.333
which are not kind to humans.

13:32.376 --> 13:33.638
See for yourself.

13:50.960 --> 13:52.179
Why would you show me that?

13:52.222 --> 13:53.833
- Because that
is what is going to happen

13:53.876 --> 13:56.357
if you bring your mother back.

13:56.400 --> 14:00.317
Life as a human is a life
of pain and suffering.

14:00.361 --> 14:02.667
Constantine promised
to bring your mother back

14:02.711 --> 14:04.669
as if it would solve
all your problems,

14:04.713 --> 14:06.976
but what he didn't tell you

14:07.020 --> 14:11.024
was you're just postponing
the inevitable.

14:11.067 --> 14:13.591
Why bring your mother back

14:13.635 --> 14:19.075
only to lose her
all over again?

14:19.119 --> 14:21.686
- Look, I couldn't just sit
in that bus and do nothing.

14:21.730 --> 14:23.384
- Well, I suppose it's good
to go through the motions.

14:23.427 --> 14:25.908
At least it gives you
the illusion of control.

14:25.952 --> 14:27.214
- Yeah, I'm not just going
through the motions.

14:27.257 --> 14:29.346
I'm actually doing something
to save my brother.

14:29.390 --> 14:32.523
- Yeah, and I was
actually trying to help Astra,

14:32.567 --> 14:34.047
and look what happened there.

14:34.090 --> 14:37.311
- You may see no point in
trying, but I'm not giving up.

14:37.354 --> 14:39.139
- Have you ever considered
the possibility

14:39.182 --> 14:41.358
that your brother's fate
is doomed in every timeline?

14:41.402 --> 14:44.884
Apparently, this bloke
Rip Hunter used to say that,

14:44.927 --> 14:49.366
you know, certain things
are just inevitable.

14:49.410 --> 14:51.020
- Go to hell, John.

14:51.064 --> 14:52.935
- You know, I've been there
and back, love.

14:52.979 --> 14:55.068
Look, I'm just trying to save
you the disappointment is all.

14:55.111 --> 14:56.678
- You know what?
Let's just walk in silence.

14:56.721 --> 14:58.245
Cool?
Cool.

14:59.507 --> 15:01.030
- Yeah.

15:01.074 --> 15:04.294
Real smooth, Johnny.
Real smooth.

15:11.345 --> 15:13.869
- She's so intriguing.

15:13.913 --> 15:15.958
- Gary, she's positively evil.

15:16.002 --> 15:19.179
- But she's so talented
with those weird knives.

15:19.222 --> 15:21.833
- Well, ever mind her many
splendid talents, Gary.

15:21.877 --> 15:24.749
I must ask you to focus.
Pay attention now.

15:24.793 --> 15:27.100
- Okay, but how
are we gonna distract her

15:27.143 --> 15:29.276
to grab the ring
so she doesn't notice?

15:29.319 --> 15:32.627
I've got an idea.

15:32.670 --> 15:33.671
Wish me luck.

15:34.716 --> 15:36.544
- Good luck.

16:12.014 --> 16:14.103
- What's up?

16:14.147 --> 16:17.193
- I really don't think I
should've let John and Zari go.

16:17.237 --> 16:19.195
What if we get the bus up and
running before they get back

16:19.239 --> 16:20.327
or even worse, more zombies?

16:20.370 --> 16:22.198
Then what am I supposed to--
- Hey.

16:22.242 --> 16:24.461
Don't sweat it
if the plan falls apart.

16:24.505 --> 16:26.681
Sometimes
the best solutions come

16:26.724 --> 16:28.813
when there is no plan at all.

16:28.857 --> 16:31.991
Besides, Legends are
all about improvisation.

16:32.034 --> 16:33.862
It's kind of like, uh,

16:33.905 --> 16:35.603
freeform jazz.

16:35.646 --> 16:37.692
- Ugh, I hate freeform jazz.

16:37.735 --> 16:39.041
- Oh, me, too.

16:39.085 --> 16:41.391
Uh, it sounds like
we have company.

16:41.435 --> 16:43.306
- Whoa, I think
those are soldiers.

16:43.350 --> 16:45.352
Uh, maybe they can help us get
to London.

16:45.395 --> 16:47.267
- What'd I tell ya?

16:49.573 --> 16:51.097
- Oh, hey, guys.
Hi.

16:51.140 --> 16:53.664
Oh, oh, we are so glad
you found us.

16:53.708 --> 16:54.970
- Stay where you are.

16:55.014 --> 16:56.189
They've got blood
on their clothes.

16:56.232 --> 16:57.277
They might be infected.

16:57.320 --> 16:58.756
- But--
- No.

16:58.800 --> 17:00.106
- No, it's not.

17:00.149 --> 17:01.194
- No, no, no,
we're not infected.

17:01.237 --> 17:02.978
all:

17:03.022 --> 17:04.066
- Ava!

17:09.115 --> 17:10.246
- Oh.

17:10.290 --> 17:13.119
Ow!

17:17.949 --> 17:19.473
Ow.

17:19.516 --> 17:20.909
- My God.

17:20.952 --> 17:22.780
These zombies
can withstand headshots.

17:22.824 --> 17:25.000
- Since when do zombies talk,
you idiot?

17:25.044 --> 17:27.698
- Super-zombies
who have become sentient.

17:27.742 --> 17:29.874
Round them up and
take them back to base camp.

17:40.233 --> 17:42.235
- Lachesis?

17:42.278 --> 17:43.410
- Yes?

17:43.453 --> 17:44.846
- The rings are gone.

17:46.804 --> 17:49.242
- I don't understand.
How could this happen?

17:49.285 --> 17:50.678
- There must be someone else
on the ship.

17:53.594 --> 17:57.119
- You're right.
Someone else is here.

18:03.169 --> 18:06.259
And I know exactly who it is.

18:07.216 --> 18:11.090
- I got the rings.
We make an amazing team.

18:11.133 --> 18:13.135
We should have
our own spin-off.

18:13.179 --> 18:16.399
♪ Gideon and Gary,
having adventures ♪

18:16.443 --> 18:21.317
♪ Solving problems
and saving the world ♪

18:21.361 --> 18:22.666
- Brilliant song, Gary!

18:22.710 --> 18:24.190
You must teach it to me
once you've managed

18:24.233 --> 18:25.321
to wrestle control
of the Waverider

18:25.365 --> 18:26.975
from those pesky sisters.

18:27.018 --> 18:28.890
- I know how we can do that.
- Mm-hmm?

18:28.933 --> 18:30.935
- We'll blow up the ship.

18:30.979 --> 18:34.809
- Or perhaps we'll do something
just a smidge less suicidal?

18:34.852 --> 18:36.593
- Oh, that sounds like fun.

18:36.637 --> 18:38.204
- Let's track down a Courier

18:38.247 --> 18:40.031
so we can jump the rest
of the Legends here.

18:40.075 --> 18:42.425
- Well,
what are we waiting for?

18:42.469 --> 18:47.387
Let's go to the lab
and make those Couriers ours.

18:47.430 --> 18:51.042
- Gary, you're making me blush.

18:53.567 --> 18:54.611
- Let's go.

18:59.573 --> 19:01.183
- This is charming.

19:02.532 --> 19:04.317
How'd you hear
about this place?

19:04.360 --> 19:06.536
- Well, back in the day,
Old Man Joe called me about

19:06.580 --> 19:08.103
a demon-possessed '75 Fiat.

19:08.147 --> 19:10.061
It was a right messy exorcism.

19:10.105 --> 19:11.454
And a right crappy car.

19:11.498 --> 19:14.457
Ah, now there's a beauty.
All right, come on.

19:14.501 --> 19:16.764
We don't want to be out here
any longer than we have to be.

19:18.679 --> 19:20.289
- What was that?

19:20.333 --> 19:22.900
- It's not a sound we want
to be waiting around for.

19:24.293 --> 19:25.990
Okay, come on, let's go.
This way, go!

19:31.605 --> 19:33.041
Come on, quick!

19:43.443 --> 19:45.184
- Okay,
I'll go find the van keys.

19:45.227 --> 19:47.708
- Yeah, all right, yeah.
You do that.

19:57.500 --> 19:59.023
- Okay.

20:08.250 --> 20:09.686
Thanks, Old Man Joe.

20:27.400 --> 20:30.141
- What is that infernal racket?
Are you all right?

20:30.185 --> 20:32.492
- Yup, yeah, I'm fine.
Just--

20:32.535 --> 20:35.538
filing this away
for future therapy.

20:37.801 --> 20:38.933
Okay.

20:43.503 --> 20:44.504
- We better leg it
to that chip van

20:44.547 --> 20:46.375
before you become
zombie fodder.

20:46.419 --> 20:49.639
- John, there's too many
of them out there.

20:49.683 --> 20:52.903
But they're not interested
in you.

20:52.947 --> 20:54.862
You need to take the van,
find the team, and save Behrad.

20:54.905 --> 20:56.690
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
That is a terrible idea.

20:56.733 --> 20:58.300
- Why, because
you didn't think of it?

20:58.344 --> 21:00.824
- Because I'm not leaving you
here to die, all right?

21:02.957 --> 21:04.437
That's it.

21:04.480 --> 21:05.655
- Oh, and now you're good
with leaving me to die?

21:05.699 --> 21:07.440
- Well, yes to death,
no to leaving.

21:07.483 --> 21:09.311
You see, there was this spell
that the ancient Egyptians--

21:09.355 --> 21:10.704
- I don't need the history
lesson, John, just do it.

21:10.747 --> 21:13.359
- Yeah, all right, but it means
stopping your heart.

21:13.402 --> 21:15.317
And when I do that,
we've only got a few minutes

21:15.361 --> 21:16.449
before the rest of you stops.

21:16.492 --> 21:19.495
It's risky, and anything
can go wrong.

21:20.888 --> 21:22.324
- You know what?

21:22.368 --> 21:25.458
This whole day has gone wrong,
so why stop now?

21:25.501 --> 21:27.634
- Why, indeed.

21:30.201 --> 21:31.855
- You're making
a huge mistake!

21:31.899 --> 21:34.075
What sentient zombies
are this well-dressed?

21:34.118 --> 21:37.861
- Damn it, I promised Lita
I'd never get locked up again.

21:37.905 --> 21:39.559
This stays between us.

21:39.602 --> 21:40.995
- Okay, I'm just gonna make up
a speech.

21:41.038 --> 21:42.562
About what, I don't know.
Just made it up on the spot.

21:42.605 --> 21:44.912
- Ava's lost it?
She's lost it.

21:44.955 --> 21:46.261
- Shh, she's thinking.

21:46.305 --> 21:47.262
- Ah, okay!
You know what, guys?

21:47.306 --> 21:48.568
Wha--um...

21:48.611 --> 21:51.135
we're not wasting
any more time in this tin can.

21:51.179 --> 21:52.354
And let's try to get creative

21:52.398 --> 21:53.790
and think about
what resources we have.

21:53.834 --> 21:55.401
- Okay.

21:55.444 --> 21:57.664
- Look, we've got a guy
who turns into steel.

21:57.707 --> 22:00.101
We've got a shapeshifter,
right?

22:00.144 --> 22:01.494
That's fricking amazing.

22:01.537 --> 22:02.843
We've got
a kickass blind assassin.

22:02.886 --> 22:04.410
And a reformed thief
turned romance novelist.

22:04.453 --> 22:06.542
- Who you calling reformed?

22:06.586 --> 22:09.415
- Oh, well--
- Whoa, wait a minute.

22:09.458 --> 22:11.504
I've been locked up
in one of these before.

22:13.070 --> 22:15.246
There's a weak door...

22:15.290 --> 22:17.423
down here somewhere.

22:19.250 --> 22:20.295
Ah.

22:20.339 --> 22:22.210
Steel Boy, punch.

22:22.253 --> 22:24.343
- I'd be honored.

22:24.386 --> 22:25.561
- Well, wait, what,

22:25.605 --> 22:28.434
so we're gonna just jump out
of a moving car?

22:28.477 --> 22:30.305
- Uh, yeah, well, you know,
we're not gonna die,

22:30.349 --> 22:31.306
but it's really gonna hurt.

22:33.787 --> 22:36.137
- Okay, who's first?

22:36.180 --> 22:37.443
- You!
- Hey!

22:37.486 --> 22:38.966
- Oh, God!

22:39.009 --> 22:41.838
- Outta here, sucker!

22:41.882 --> 22:44.188
- All right, then.
Well, come on, step right up.

22:44.232 --> 22:45.842
- Got her?
- Yeah, I got her, Ava.

22:45.886 --> 22:49.368
- Oh, I'm actually glad I can't
see what's about to happen.

22:49.411 --> 22:51.587
- Okay, and jump!

22:51.631 --> 22:53.633
- This actually wasn't part
of the plan!

22:59.595 --> 23:00.422
- Ow.

23:00.466 --> 23:03.294
all:

23:05.862 --> 23:08.387
Well, Ava, as far
as inspirational speeches go,

23:08.430 --> 23:09.605
I'd give that
a gentlemen's seven.

23:09.649 --> 23:11.651
- Know what?
I will take it,

23:11.694 --> 23:13.479
because now
we are 80 miles from London

23:13.522 --> 23:15.481
which is, you know--

23:15.524 --> 23:16.656
ow--closer
than we were before.

23:16.699 --> 23:18.658
- Yeah.
- We're never gonna make it.

23:18.701 --> 23:20.529
- Hey, never say never.

23:20.573 --> 23:23.010
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
Can you help us?

23:24.272 --> 23:26.709
- Don't stop, Wilbur!
Zombies!

23:26.753 --> 23:28.711
- Ay, ay.
Damn it.

23:31.540 --> 23:32.759
- You're giving off a vibe.

23:32.802 --> 23:34.151
- Oh, man.

23:34.195 --> 23:37.328
- Come on, babe, we gotta walk.
- I'm coming.

23:43.552 --> 23:47.513
- All right, love, can you
give me a bit of room here, eh?

23:47.556 --> 23:50.603
Sure.

23:50.646 --> 23:52.126
Okay.

23:56.130 --> 23:57.653
- If I die, I can't believe

23:57.697 --> 23:59.220
the last thing I'm gonna see
is your face.

23:59.263 --> 24:02.397
-  Well, better than
those zombies out there, eh?

24:02.441 --> 24:03.964
- Debatable.

24:04.007 --> 24:07.794
Yeah?
All right, love.

24:07.837 --> 24:10.361
Close your eyes now.

24:10.405 --> 24:12.494
- Okay.

25:39.189 --> 25:41.452
No, no, no, no, no, no,
don't do this to me.

25:41.496 --> 25:43.237
Don't do this to me.

25:43.280 --> 25:45.195
Come on, Zari, come on.

25:45.239 --> 25:48.938
Come on, don't do this.
Come on, come back to me, love!

25:48.982 --> 25:50.026
Come back to me!

25:51.811 --> 25:53.943
- Oh, come on.

25:58.644 --> 26:00.994
- Is this
what a hangover feels like?

26:05.520 --> 26:06.608
- We need to get out of here.

26:16.792 --> 26:18.751
- Got one.
- Smashing job, Gary.

26:18.794 --> 26:20.143
Now let's go get your friend

26:20.187 --> 26:22.232
so we can finish this adventure
once and for all.

26:22.276 --> 26:23.843
- Easy enough.

26:23.886 --> 26:25.888
- Drop it.

26:27.760 --> 26:30.589
- She means it.
She'll skin you alive.

26:30.632 --> 26:32.721
What are you doing, Astra?

26:32.765 --> 26:34.027
Why are you working with them?

26:34.070 --> 26:36.333
- Now give us the rings.
We know you have them.

26:38.379 --> 26:41.512
- Gideon, run!
Save yourself!

26:43.558 --> 26:47.649
- The moron is speaking
to the rabbit.

26:47.693 --> 26:49.216
- The rings are
in your pocket.

26:49.259 --> 26:50.783
Give them to us.

26:50.826 --> 26:53.437
- Gideon, help me.

26:53.481 --> 26:55.004
- I can't, Gary.

26:55.048 --> 26:57.572
I'm just a figment
of your imagination.

26:57.616 --> 26:59.182
But you must
believe in yourself

26:59.226 --> 27:01.620
and don't give in,
no matter what they do.

27:03.665 --> 27:05.536
- How could I
give you the rings

27:05.580 --> 27:08.061
if they were never really here?

27:11.064 --> 27:12.282
- Trickery.

27:12.326 --> 27:13.283
- Yeah, I may
have been electrocuted

27:13.327 --> 27:14.763
by Gideon's mainframe,

27:14.807 --> 27:16.852
but I could still do
a simple obfuscation spell.

27:16.896 --> 27:20.073
- Time for more
persuasive tactics.

27:20.116 --> 27:21.988
- Ah!

27:26.819 --> 27:28.690
- Those headlights
are coming in fast.

27:28.734 --> 27:30.823
- All right, everybody.
Just be cool, yeah?

27:30.866 --> 27:32.694
Try to act as
un-zombielike as possible.

27:32.738 --> 27:34.261
- Maybe Mick should stand
in the back.

27:34.304 --> 27:35.262
- Ooh.

27:39.527 --> 27:42.138
- Get in, losers.
We're going Looming.

28:01.636 --> 28:03.725
- Uh, hello?

28:03.769 --> 28:07.120
Ex-Director Sharpe here.
Who's manning this post?

28:23.353 --> 28:24.790
A-ha.

28:24.833 --> 28:27.357
- Well, cheers
to this nightmare of a day

28:27.401 --> 28:28.707
coming to an end soon.

28:28.750 --> 28:30.099
- I will drink to that.

28:30.143 --> 28:31.884
- Yeah, well, we're not out
of the woods, yet, love,

28:31.927 --> 28:33.537
but you can sign me up
for a beer anytime.

28:37.628 --> 28:38.891
- Yeah, John was right.

28:38.934 --> 28:40.588
We are not out
of the woods yet.

28:40.631 --> 28:43.852
- Is it dead?
- Yeah, how did you know?

28:46.986 --> 28:48.465
- Great, that's just great.

28:48.509 --> 28:50.990
My brother's gone forever,
and the world's gonna end

28:51.033 --> 28:52.774
because someone forgot
to charge it.

28:52.818 --> 28:54.080
Great.

29:07.354 --> 29:09.269
- Smoke break?

29:09.312 --> 29:12.663
- Actually...

29:12.707 --> 29:15.231
I quit smoking.

29:15.275 --> 29:16.711
Again.

29:16.755 --> 29:17.843
- Mm, don't tell me.

29:17.886 --> 29:20.933
You finally found something
to live for?

29:20.976 --> 29:22.804
There's no point.

29:22.848 --> 29:26.286
The Fates are literally
against us.

29:26.329 --> 29:30.246
I mean, how else do you explain
an overnight zombie apocalypse?

29:30.290 --> 29:33.554
Or the fact that we're now
at the mercy of a charger?

29:35.730 --> 29:37.036
- You know, I gotta say.

29:37.079 --> 29:39.952
All this
doom and gloom attitude

29:39.995 --> 29:41.910
really don't suit you, love.

29:41.954 --> 29:43.085
- I'm sorry, I didn't realize

29:43.129 --> 29:45.218
you had a monopoly
on doom and gloom.

29:45.261 --> 29:46.959
- No, no, no,
I'm just saying, you know,

29:47.002 --> 29:48.743
you stick
to what you know best is all.

29:48.787 --> 29:50.223
- Yeah, I'm not gonna
take advice

29:50.266 --> 29:52.529
from a "professional" exorcist
with a savior complex.

29:52.573 --> 29:55.184
-  Come on,
I do not have a savior complex.

29:55.228 --> 29:56.925
- Are you serious right now?

29:56.969 --> 29:59.623
Oh, save me from my demons,
John Constantine.

29:59.667 --> 30:00.886
- Oh, well, what about you,
then?

30:00.929 --> 30:02.148
I mean,
you talk about savior complex,

30:02.191 --> 30:04.715
what with all your self-help
and advice videos,

30:04.759 --> 30:06.892
saving your minions
from a life of drudgery.

30:06.935 --> 30:09.503
- I give my followers something
to aspire to.

30:09.546 --> 30:11.984
- Aspire to, really?
What's that, then?

30:12.027 --> 30:15.901
Oh, yeah, it's, uh,
being a superficial git.

30:15.944 --> 30:18.555
- If you think I'm superficial,
then why are you here with me?

30:18.599 --> 30:20.035
- Do you know what?
I don't know.

30:20.079 --> 30:21.645
I just think I haven't had
enough punishment for one day.

30:21.689 --> 30:23.038
- Punishment?

30:23.082 --> 30:24.997
You should just go, then.
Right now.

30:25.040 --> 30:26.259
- You want me to leave?
Because I will leave.

30:26.302 --> 30:27.738
I will go right now
and I will not come back.

30:27.782 --> 30:28.870
- Good, great, leave.

30:28.914 --> 30:30.176
I wouldn't want
to be with you right now

30:30.219 --> 30:32.004
if you were the last man
on Earth.

30:32.047 --> 30:33.222
- Well, good, because I
wouldn't want to be with you

30:33.266 --> 30:35.268
if you were the last woman--

30:46.888 --> 30:49.499
- So, where should we start?

30:49.543 --> 30:54.940
Head, shoulders, knees,
or toes?

30:54.983 --> 30:58.030
- How about none
of those things?

30:58.073 --> 31:01.511
- You can hand me those rings
or you can give me your hands.

31:01.555 --> 31:02.904
It is that simple.

31:02.948 --> 31:06.473
- This isn't you.
You're not like them.

31:07.822 --> 31:09.737
- You don't know a thing
about me.

31:09.780 --> 31:12.000
- I do know that
when you had to choose between

31:12.044 --> 31:13.915
staying in Hell or putting
your trust in the Legends,

31:13.959 --> 31:17.484
you grabbed Ava's hand
and took a leap of faith.

31:23.751 --> 31:25.405
- That was a mistake.

31:25.448 --> 31:27.059
A moment of weakness

31:27.102 --> 31:30.105
when I still believed
I wanted to see my mother.

31:30.149 --> 31:33.108
- Wait, you don't want your
mother to come back anymore?

31:33.152 --> 31:36.285
- Not if it means losing her
all over again.

31:36.329 --> 31:39.027
Lachesis opened my eyes
and showed me her death

31:39.071 --> 31:41.247
and what it would be like
if I brought her back.

31:41.290 --> 31:44.990
- You actually had
to see your mother die?

31:45.033 --> 31:46.992
Are you okay?
'Cause if I were you,

31:47.035 --> 31:48.471
I--I--I'd be a big puddle--

31:48.515 --> 31:50.996
- Of course I am not okay.

31:51.039 --> 31:53.128
It was bad enough losing her
when I was a kid.

31:53.172 --> 31:56.566
- But did this Lachesis lady
show you anything else?

31:56.610 --> 32:00.005
Like, what about all the
good moments before she died?

32:00.048 --> 32:01.920
- Why bother?

32:01.963 --> 32:04.226
Those memories would be
painful reminders

32:04.270 --> 32:06.881
of what I would one day
have to lose.

32:06.925 --> 32:08.927
- You must have some memories
of your mom

32:08.970 --> 32:13.714
when you were little
that make you smile, right?

32:13.757 --> 32:15.977
Well,
maybe instead of torturing me,

32:16.021 --> 32:21.026
you could, I don't know,
share one?

32:27.423 --> 32:29.121
- You guys good?

32:29.164 --> 32:30.470
- Yeah.
Feeling a little better.

32:30.513 --> 32:33.995
- Wow, are those yams?
Horrible, aren't they?

32:34.039 --> 32:35.388
- Look, guys.

32:35.431 --> 32:38.260
I know today was--
was rough.

32:38.304 --> 32:41.176
I mean, you got shot
in the head, for Pete's sake.

32:41.220 --> 32:43.048
- Why'd you have
to bring that up?

32:43.091 --> 32:47.182
- If I could,
I'd spend every day like this,

32:47.226 --> 32:48.792
sitting around with my pals.

32:48.836 --> 32:50.229
- Aww.

32:50.272 --> 32:53.014
- Well, you can end every day
any way you like

32:53.058 --> 32:54.276
with the Loom of Fate, mate.

32:54.320 --> 32:56.148
You know,
after we best your sister,

32:56.191 --> 32:58.889
any one of us might be called
to use the Loom,

32:58.933 --> 33:00.152
and you got
to ask the question,

33:00.195 --> 33:02.676
what kind of temptations
we'd have.

33:02.719 --> 33:04.069
- I'm actually

33:04.112 --> 33:08.769
pretty happy just flying
through time with you guys.

33:08.812 --> 33:10.814
I got my lady.
- Mm-hmm.

33:10.858 --> 33:14.340
- I'm pretty happy.
- Same.

33:14.383 --> 33:18.735
- I'd be a criminal again.
A simple life.

33:18.779 --> 33:21.434
- You know,
if Behrad were alive

33:21.477 --> 33:26.134
and we were together
and happy, I--

33:26.178 --> 33:29.050
I don't know,
I would use my talents

33:29.094 --> 33:31.226
to make the world a more...

33:31.270 --> 33:33.750
inclusive, better place,
I guess.

33:36.101 --> 33:41.149
- Well, I, for one, would
throw a multi-continent rager.

33:42.846 --> 33:44.283
- Would you really, though,
John-o?

33:44.326 --> 33:45.284
- I would, yeah.

33:45.327 --> 33:48.287
- There's nothing
a little deeper,

33:48.330 --> 33:50.158
a little closer to your heart?

33:53.248 --> 33:56.164
- Oh, you know, uh--

33:56.208 --> 33:59.602
even after everything
that's happened,

33:59.646 --> 34:03.171
I'd want to do right by Astra,
you know?

34:03.215 --> 34:07.175
Make sure she was happy
growing up in a big house

34:07.219 --> 34:08.785
and I could keep an eye on her.

34:11.223 --> 34:14.965
- Sure is nice to dream.
- I drink to that.

34:15.009 --> 34:16.271
Cheers.

34:16.315 --> 34:18.099
others: Cheers.

34:35.334 --> 34:39.120
- Okay.

34:39.164 --> 34:40.904
What are you not telling me?

34:40.948 --> 34:43.168
- Nothing.

34:43.211 --> 34:45.344
Come on.

34:45.387 --> 34:49.435
Let me guess, you didn't really
lose your powers, yeah?

34:49.478 --> 34:52.307
You had a vision,
and you saw the future,

34:52.351 --> 34:53.700
and you don't want to tell me
about what happened,

34:53.743 --> 34:55.528
am I right?

34:55.571 --> 34:58.444
- The Courier's
not gonna charge in time.

34:58.487 --> 35:00.402
- In time for what?

35:00.446 --> 35:03.797
In time to escape before that
front door gets busted down

35:03.840 --> 35:05.320
by what's outside.

35:07.192 --> 35:09.368
- Why'd you lie to me, babe?

35:09.411 --> 35:13.415
-  Because my vision
ended with me dying here.

35:15.983 --> 35:17.941
In this pub.

35:19.682 --> 35:22.294
- Sorry, what?

35:22.337 --> 35:23.991
Oh, my God, I can't really
think straight.

35:24.034 --> 35:26.341
I just--
- It's okay.

35:26.385 --> 35:29.170
This is why I didn't want
to tell you.

35:29.214 --> 35:30.476
I didn't want to distract you

35:30.519 --> 35:33.174
from getting the team
to this moment.

35:33.218 --> 35:34.654
- Okay, so you've been
saying goodbye

35:34.697 --> 35:37.700
and just pushing me
to take over this whole time?

35:37.744 --> 35:41.182
- Yes, but it--it's a
temporary, goodbye, all right?

35:41.226 --> 35:43.402
Because you guys--
you're gonna--

35:43.445 --> 35:45.621
you're gonna fix this, and
you're gonna save the day.

35:45.665 --> 35:47.057
- Did you happen
to have some sort of vision

35:47.101 --> 35:48.450
of how we save the day, Sara?

35:48.494 --> 35:49.930
Because that would be
really helpful right now.

35:49.973 --> 35:51.236
- I wish, but no.

35:51.279 --> 35:53.063
I couldn't see anything
past my death.

35:53.107 --> 35:55.240
That was it.

35:55.283 --> 35:58.808
- Okay.
And what if we don't succeed?

35:58.852 --> 36:01.115
- I have faith in you, babe.

36:01.159 --> 36:03.073
And I have faith in this team,

36:03.117 --> 36:06.555
and after I go,
you will fix it, I know it.

36:06.599 --> 36:08.427
- Um--

36:08.470 --> 36:11.386
I don't want
to freak you guys out, but...

36:11.430 --> 36:13.693
we're completely surrounded
by zombies.

36:28.621 --> 36:29.926
- Looks like
they're biding their time

36:29.970 --> 36:31.363
until our immortality runs out.

36:31.406 --> 36:35.410
- Well, that means
the inevitable has arrived.

36:35.454 --> 36:37.978
Kiss your immortality goodbye.

36:58.346 --> 37:00.914
- It's strange,
the memories you hold on to

37:00.957 --> 37:02.829
when someone's gone.

37:04.744 --> 37:07.834
My mom loved strawberries,

37:07.877 --> 37:09.966
and one year, we went

37:10.010 --> 37:12.360
strawberry picking
at this farm.

37:12.404 --> 37:16.016
And we just ate them
right off the vine.

37:16.059 --> 37:18.497
They didn't even make it
to the basket.

37:18.540 --> 37:24.024
We just spent the whole day
stuffing ourselves.

37:24.067 --> 37:26.809
- Sounds like a cool lady.

37:26.853 --> 37:29.247
- She was.

37:29.290 --> 37:30.726
- Think about all the
strawberries you could pick--

37:30.770 --> 37:32.598
if you came--
- Okay, enough wheedling.

37:32.641 --> 37:35.340
Just show me how
to use this damn thing

37:35.383 --> 37:38.604
so we can get help and I can
bring her back already.

37:38.647 --> 37:40.301
- Okay, yeah.

37:40.345 --> 37:42.303
So--
- Congratulations.

37:42.347 --> 37:44.218
You're just as weak
as any other human.

37:44.262 --> 37:47.613
Your immortality's run out.
Time's up.

37:54.794 --> 37:56.709
The rings...

37:56.752 --> 37:58.754
or join your friend
on the floor.

38:03.585 --> 38:06.675
- We just have to hold out
until the Courier charges.

38:13.856 --> 38:15.467
- That door's not gonna hold.

38:15.510 --> 38:18.557
- Once they're inside, I'll
hold them off as long as I can.

38:26.304 --> 38:28.218
- Sara.

38:28.262 --> 38:30.743
- Co-captains for life.
- Always.

38:38.054 --> 38:39.360
- Come on!

39:02.427 --> 39:04.342
- Bloody thing's
still charging!

39:17.224 --> 39:18.747
- Hey, deadheads!

39:18.791 --> 39:21.228
Over here!

39:59.266 --> 40:00.833
- Sara!

40:05.359 --> 40:08.971
- It's charged.

40:09.015 --> 40:10.538
- Charlie, you have to go.

40:10.582 --> 40:11.539
Deal with your sisters
and fix this.

40:11.583 --> 40:13.411
- How?
- You outsmarted them

40:13.454 --> 40:15.630
once before.
You can do it again.

41:01.371 --> 41:03.678
- Gary.

41:03.722 --> 41:05.593
Charlie, thank God you're here.

41:05.637 --> 41:07.508
Your sisters took over
the ship,

41:07.552 --> 41:09.641
and they somehow convinced
Astra to work with them,

41:09.684 --> 41:10.772
and then I convinced her
she was wrong,

41:10.816 --> 41:13.383
which was how she ended up
on the floor.

41:13.427 --> 41:14.515
Where's everyone else?

41:14.559 --> 41:15.516
- There's no time to explain.

41:15.560 --> 41:16.865
Where are the rings?

41:16.909 --> 41:18.519
- Okay, yeah.

41:20.565 --> 41:21.566
We have to be careful.

41:21.609 --> 41:22.567
Your sisters were just--

41:37.103 --> 41:38.583
- What a pity.

41:38.626 --> 41:40.672
- You've come crawling back.

41:40.715 --> 41:42.282
- You're just in time, Clotho.

41:46.068 --> 41:49.507
- I'm done running.

41:49.550 --> 41:50.899
Now...

41:50.943 --> 41:52.988
let's get to work.

42:21.147 --> 42:22.714
- Greg, move your head!
