00:35.668 --> 00:39.102
The old heated doorknob. Nice try.

00:39.169 --> 00:41.302
Lester, you still giving me
the silent treatment?

00:45.668 --> 00:46.769
Okay.

00:46.835 --> 00:48.735
Everybody, good morning.

00:48.802 --> 00:49.769
Good morning.

00:49.835 --> 00:50.769
Your coffee, sir.

00:50.835 --> 00:52.469
Ah, Jeffrey, thank you so much.

00:56.002 --> 00:58.102
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

00:58.169 --> 01:00.635
You know, call me old-fashioned, but...

01:00.702 --> 01:02.969
I just... I prefer cream over laxative.

01:05.369 --> 01:07.568
I need everybody's attention.

01:07.635 --> 01:09.935
I know some of you are unhappy
that I'm running the Buy More.

01:10.002 --> 01:11.469
I'm sorry.

01:11.535 --> 01:13.735
But all your little tricks
and your tactics...

01:13.802 --> 01:15.369
I know them all.

01:15.436 --> 01:16.602
I taught you them.

01:16.668 --> 01:17.802
So listen up.

01:17.869 --> 01:19.969
No more sabotage.

01:20.036 --> 01:21.735
Thank you.

01:21.802 --> 01:22.735
Lester, you're in my chair.

01:22.802 --> 01:24.535
If there's one thing
I learned in Hawaii,

01:24.602 --> 01:26.403
is that I'm good at this, men.

01:26.469 --> 01:28.436
I am good at the Buy More.

01:36.202 --> 01:38.436
Do me a favor and grab Chuck for me?

01:39.668 --> 01:41.136
Could somebody grab Chuck for me?

01:41.202 --> 01:43.503
Hey, Jeff, can you send
Chuck back here for me?

01:43.568 --> 01:44.702
Chuck!

01:44.769 --> 01:47.403
Casey, I want to ask
you about a Beastmaster.

01:47.469 --> 01:48.403
Really?

01:48.469 --> 01:50.269
No, not really.

01:50.336 --> 01:52.102
Hey, have we got any more info

01:52.169 --> 01:53.602
on you-know-who
down in Castle?

01:53.668 --> 01:56.169
- Shaw?
- Yeah, yeah, Shaw.

01:56.236 --> 01:57.403
I'm busy here, Chuck.
Why don't you

01:57.469 --> 01:58.602
talk to him yourself?
He's living there.

01:58.668 --> 02:00.602
Living in Castle. What? What?!

02:00.668 --> 02:02.336
Casey, what's going on?

02:02.403 --> 02:04.202
Is he really in charge of our team?

02:04.269 --> 02:07.635
Shaw's a special agent for the CIA.

02:07.702 --> 02:09.668
He can do pretty much
whatever he wants.

02:09.735 --> 02:11.036
Even more special than me?

02:11.102 --> 02:12.302
It gets worse.

02:12.369 --> 02:14.036
Whenever a special agent
takes over an operation,

02:14.102 --> 02:15.602
they conduct a review.

02:15.668 --> 02:17.302
Sarah's in there with him right now.

02:17.369 --> 02:19.169
What do you think
they're talking about?

02:19.236 --> 02:21.102
Is Chuck Bartkowski a real spy?

02:21.169 --> 02:23.202
Yes, of course he is.

02:23.269 --> 02:25.635
I mean, his training has been irregular

02:25.702 --> 02:29.036
and he was a civilian
only two years ago.

02:29.102 --> 02:30.835
Well, these mission reports
tell a different story.

02:30.902 --> 02:32.136
Sometimes he sounds like Bond,

02:32.202 --> 02:34.169
and other times it's
like a Jerry Lewis movie.

02:34.236 --> 02:35.369
I need to know,

02:35.436 --> 02:36.602
is Chuck a liability?

02:36.668 --> 02:38.136
Wait. The review's about me?!

02:38.202 --> 02:39.568
Shouldn't Shaw be asking me about me?

02:39.635 --> 02:41.202
Where's the fun in that?

02:41.269 --> 02:45.369
Look, I am never gonna be able
to escape this ridiculous cover

02:45.436 --> 02:48.236
if Shaw thinks I'm some moron civilian

02:48.302 --> 02:49.869
who just got unlucky enough to get

02:49.935 --> 02:51.336
a computer dumped in his head.

02:51.403 --> 02:53.668
Fine.

02:53.735 --> 02:55.336
Help.

02:55.403 --> 02:57.869
Morgan, did you get glued to a chair?

02:57.935 --> 02:59.835
Yes. Yes, I did, okay?

02:59.902 --> 03:01.702
The whole store's
coming after me, dude.

03:01.769 --> 03:04.102
Lester went mute and
refuses to talk to me.

03:04.169 --> 03:05.769
Maybe 'cause you fired him?

03:05.835 --> 03:06.902
I don't know.

03:06.969 --> 03:08.036
They've teamed up and formed,

03:08.102 --> 03:09.369
like, an evil cabal of tricksters.

03:09.436 --> 03:11.935
I haven't had an untainted
cup of coffee in days.

03:12.002 --> 03:13.269
I need my free coffee, dude.

03:13.336 --> 03:15.002
You know, you give me
five minutes running

03:15.069 --> 03:16.535
this popsicle stand, and we'd be ready.

03:16.602 --> 03:18.036
Ready for what?

03:18.102 --> 03:20.236
The Russians.

04:40.555 --> 04:45.555

03:23.336 --> 03:24.269
Hey. Hey-hey-hey-hey.

03:24.336 --> 03:25.269
Guys, a little help.

03:25.336 --> 03:26.568
Is that... is that Shaw?

03:26.635 --> 03:29.403
Listen, I'm an integral member
of this team, okay?

03:29.469 --> 03:31.036
My voice should be heard.

03:31.102 --> 03:32.835
Oh, your prepubescent
little girl screams

03:32.902 --> 03:34.002
are gonna be duly noted.

03:34.069 --> 03:36.236
Actually, right now.
He wants to see you.

03:43.269 --> 03:46.602
Look, Shaw, I'm quite certain
that things have been said

03:46.668 --> 03:48.769
about either myself or
my abilities as a spy,

03:48.835 --> 03:50.869
and while I concede that
there are more traditional

03:50.935 --> 03:52.202
or professional spies out there...

03:52.269 --> 03:54.403
Chuck, this is my meeting.

03:54.469 --> 03:56.069
Right. Sorry.

03:56.136 --> 03:57.403
Please continue.

03:57.469 --> 04:00.069
I think we can all agree that this team

04:00.136 --> 04:02.769
has been dysfunctional
the last two years.

04:02.835 --> 04:04.635
And I think I know what the problem is.

04:04.702 --> 04:07.568
The problem is them.

04:07.635 --> 04:08.635
What?

04:08.702 --> 04:09.436
What does that mean?

04:09.503 --> 04:10.535
It means he's a moron.

04:10.602 --> 04:12.102
Chuck, they coddle you.

04:12.169 --> 04:14.436
You could be a great spy,
but they won't let you evolve.

04:14.503 --> 04:15.869
Really?

04:15.935 --> 04:18.101
I mean, yes, yes, really.
He's right.

04:18.168 --> 04:19.302
Let me be a spy.

04:19.369 --> 04:20.935
Let me out of the car. I'm ready.

04:21.002 --> 04:22.635
No, Shaw, he's not.

04:22.702 --> 04:24.935
Duly noted... and ignored.

04:26.101 --> 04:28.580
Chuck, you're going on
your first solo mission

04:28.702 --> 04:30.469
Undercover in Paris.

04:30.535 --> 04:31.469
Are you ready?

04:35.702 --> 04:38.735
Absolutely.

05:16.747 --> 05:19.688
Um, so what are we doing here exactly?

05:20.282 --> 05:22.149
Since your Intersect
skills can be glitchy,

05:22.215 --> 05:23.516
you'll need some basic spycraft

05:23.582 --> 05:25.015
for this mission.

05:25.082 --> 05:27.349
Have you ever used one of these?

05:27.416 --> 05:28.582
A pen?

05:28.649 --> 05:30.082
KGB-model tranq pen.

05:30.149 --> 05:31.416
Oh, yeah, Casey's got one of these.

05:31.482 --> 05:34.182
Aim it at your target's food or drink,

05:34.249 --> 05:36.149
and it's bedtime for bad guy.

05:39.482 --> 05:40.948
You want me to tranq Jeff?

05:41.015 --> 05:41.915
I can't do that.

05:41.982 --> 05:43.015
I've read everyone's file.

05:43.082 --> 05:44.616
Jeff Barnes will be just fine.

05:44.682 --> 05:46.315
Come on, Chuck, are you up for this?

05:46.382 --> 05:48.682
Yeah.

05:50.816 --> 05:51.948
Hey, Jeffy-Jeff.

05:52.015 --> 05:53.282
How's it hanging, brother?

05:53.349 --> 05:54.816
- Everything okay?
- Yeah.

05:54.883 --> 05:58.315
Um, what do you mean, "okay"?

05:58.382 --> 06:00.349
What are you doing?

06:00.416 --> 06:02.382
You don't usually check
up on me like this.

06:02.449 --> 06:04.449
Did I do something wrong?

06:04.516 --> 06:06.382
No, no, no, no, buddy.

06:06.449 --> 06:07.649
Everything's fine.

06:07.716 --> 06:10.015
You're fine, work's fine, you know.

06:10.082 --> 06:12.048
This is more of a checking in.

06:12.115 --> 06:14.215
Just making sure that
you're feeling okay.

06:14.282 --> 06:15.716
Just a little human-

06:15.783 --> 06:17.883
to-humanoid

06:17.948 --> 06:19.215
interaction, so...

06:21.582 --> 06:23.048
Good.

06:23.115 --> 06:24.915
Thanks, yeah.
Little bit of a rocky start,

06:24.982 --> 06:26.716
but I think I finished strong.
What's next?

06:26.783 --> 06:28.315
Let's go.

06:28.382 --> 06:29.616
You're ready.

06:29.682 --> 06:31.382
Wh... whoa. I am?

06:31.449 --> 06:33.082
I'm ready after 20 seconds?

06:33.149 --> 06:34.716
After two years.

06:34.783 --> 06:37.048
I just wanted to talk
to you privately, Chuck.

06:37.115 --> 06:38.282
Listen, you've been on more missions

06:38.349 --> 06:40.482
than most spies have been
in a lifetime.

06:40.549 --> 06:42.582
Trust me, you're ready.

06:48.449 --> 06:49.915
Ah...

06:49.982 --> 06:53.783
Freshly brewed,
untouched by Jeff's lips.

06:53.849 --> 06:56.582
Checkmate, Lester. Checkmate.

06:56.649 --> 06:57.948
As assistant manager,

06:58.015 --> 07:01.282
I claim this cup of coffee for me.

07:01.349 --> 07:03.482
Mmm.

07:03.549 --> 07:05.182
Okay, that's what I'm talking...

07:05.249 --> 07:06.749
You guys got to understand something.

07:06.816 --> 07:08.948
You got to get up pretty early to get...

07:10.315 --> 07:13.215
a CIA contact will meet you in Paris.

07:13.282 --> 07:14.948
You're traveling as Carmichael,

07:15.015 --> 07:16.749
a successful businessman.

07:16.816 --> 07:18.549
Itinerary and passport.

07:18.616 --> 07:20.249
Guys, it's all good. I'm ready, okay?

07:21.948 --> 07:23.249
What are these?

07:23.315 --> 07:25.082
Nunchakus.

07:27.149 --> 07:28.749
You know very well

07:28.816 --> 07:31.015
that I don't like carrying guns around.

07:31.082 --> 07:34.149
But I thought it wouldn't
be such a bad idea to have

07:34.215 --> 07:36.649
some kind of offensive weapon,
you know,

07:36.716 --> 07:38.816
just to have with me just in case.

07:38.883 --> 07:41.616
And they're supposed to
be in the Intersect, so...

07:41.682 --> 07:43.149
Casey, can I have a second?

07:43.215 --> 07:45.349
Hmm? Yeah.

07:47.749 --> 07:50.482
Listen, I know you want this

07:50.549 --> 07:53.482
to work and you want to impress Shaw,
but this is crazy.

07:53.549 --> 07:55.416
Okay, fine, the nunchakus
are a little crazy.

07:55.482 --> 07:56.816
You weren't supposed to see those.

07:56.883 --> 07:58.182
But Shaw... an honest-to-God,

07:58.249 --> 08:00.416
real-life special agent for the CIA...

08:00.482 --> 08:01.816
Thinks that I'm ready.

08:01.883 --> 08:04.682
He thinks that I can do it,

08:04.749 --> 08:06.482
and I want to prove to him
that he's not wrong about me.

08:06.549 --> 08:08.149
I'm not saying that you can't do this,

08:08.215 --> 08:11.349
but please...

08:11.416 --> 08:13.282
Please just don't go now.

08:13.349 --> 08:15.282
Okay? You need more time.

08:15.349 --> 08:17.482
He's going.

08:18.816 --> 08:20.649
Beckman agrees with me.

08:20.716 --> 08:23.115
We set up a subnetwork on your phone.

08:23.182 --> 08:26.149
You'll be able to text
and call from the plane.

08:26.215 --> 08:28.849
Your ticket, and your
car's waiting outside.

08:28.915 --> 08:30.915
You'll receive further
instructions in Paris.

08:30.982 --> 08:32.649
Oh, daddy!

08:32.716 --> 08:33.749
First class!

08:33.816 --> 08:34.816
That is...

08:36.215 --> 08:38.448
probably what you do for everybody.

08:38.515 --> 08:41.682
Okay, well, see ya later.

08:44.082 --> 08:45.649
I hope.

08:55.783 --> 08:56.816
Thank you.

09:11.783 --> 09:13.149
Welcome to first class, sir.

09:13.215 --> 09:14.382
May I take your jacket?

09:14.449 --> 09:15.982
You want to take my jack...

09:16.048 --> 09:18.549
Oh, yes, of course.
Yes, sorry about that.

09:20.249 --> 09:21.182
There we go.

09:21.249 --> 09:22.382
Oh, actually, you know what?

09:22.449 --> 09:25.249
If I can just... Gotta get my phone

09:25.315 --> 09:27.048
and writing utensil. Okay.

09:32.849 --> 09:34.015
- Lucky pen?
- Huh?

09:34.082 --> 09:36.048
Lucky pen?

09:36.115 --> 09:39.915
No, uh, no, just a...
just a regular ol' pen-pen.

09:39.982 --> 09:40.948
Okay.

09:45.915 --> 09:47.616
I'm Chuck, by the way.
I mean, Charles.

09:47.682 --> 09:48.849
I mean, my name is Charles,

09:48.915 --> 09:50.416
but my friends call me Chuck.

09:50.482 --> 09:53.549
I'm Hannah. Just Hannah, Chuck.

09:53.616 --> 09:54.482
Good, that makes it easy.

09:54.549 --> 09:55.649
Nice to meet you.

09:55.716 --> 09:56.649
Nice to meet you.

09:56.716 --> 10:00.015
Yeah.

10:00.082 --> 10:01.682
May I offer either of you a drink?

10:01.749 --> 10:03.082
Ooh, uh, no. You know what?

10:03.149 --> 10:04.749
I'm on business, but thank you.

10:04.816 --> 10:06.349
Me, too. I'll have his.

10:06.416 --> 10:08.948
You know, on second thought,
I think I will then.

10:09.015 --> 10:11.182
Thank you.

10:11.249 --> 10:12.282
- Thank you.
- For you. Uh-huh.

10:12.349 --> 10:14.149
- Thank you.
- Sure.

10:15.516 --> 10:17.516
So what do you think
of our fellow passengers

10:17.582 --> 10:18.883
here in first class?

10:18.948 --> 10:20.982
I'm thinking

10:21.048 --> 10:22.948
Syrian dignitaries over there,

10:23.015 --> 10:26.382
couple of nuclear physicists,

10:26.449 --> 10:29.215
but that bunch,
I don't know about them.

10:29.282 --> 10:30.948
- That bunch over there?
- Uh-huh.

10:31.015 --> 10:32.816
Yeah, I'm gonna go
with Yale fencing team

10:32.883 --> 10:34.215
without a doubt.

10:34.282 --> 10:35.315
Spot-on.

10:35.382 --> 10:36.915
Oh, thanks.

10:36.982 --> 10:41.716
Now what about you,
Charles-but-my-friends-call-me-Chuck?

10:41.783 --> 10:44.282
Uh...

10:44.349 --> 10:46.115
What about... what about me?

10:46.182 --> 10:48.948
Um, I'm in retail, very high-end

10:49.015 --> 10:53.449
merchandise at a
very prestigious store.

11:05.516 --> 11:07.215
What the...?

11:07.282 --> 11:09.015
Come on! Get me out of here!

11:09.082 --> 11:10.182
This is not...

11:10.249 --> 11:12.948
Hey, Casey.

11:13.015 --> 11:14.549
Oh, thank you.

11:28.783 --> 11:30.015
See that?

11:30.082 --> 11:31.315
See that? How do you do that?

11:31.382 --> 11:32.449
You command respect. I...

11:32.516 --> 11:33.582
No.

11:33.649 --> 11:35.616
I take it.

11:46.616 --> 11:48.282
Shaken, not stirred, sir.

11:48.349 --> 11:49.883
Thank you.

11:49.948 --> 11:51.682
You don't fly first class often?

11:51.749 --> 11:53.582
Well, uh...

11:53.649 --> 11:55.883
No, no, of course I do. All the time.

11:55.948 --> 11:57.282
LA to Paris.

11:57.349 --> 11:59.682
Paris to LA.

11:59.749 --> 12:00.883
What about you?

12:00.948 --> 12:04.015
Well, I, uh,
I work for a private investor.

12:04.082 --> 12:06.215
Essentially, he just flies me
around the world,

12:06.282 --> 12:08.516
and I fix problems for him, IT stuff.

12:08.582 --> 12:10.915
Computers, mainframes.
It's terribly boring.

12:10.982 --> 12:12.749
And stress, a lot of stress.

12:12.816 --> 12:14.816
But I get to travel.

12:14.883 --> 12:15.982
And live in Paris.

12:16.048 --> 12:17.915
I have a view of the Eiffel Tower.

12:17.982 --> 12:19.282
No way. Really?

12:19.349 --> 12:21.549
Yeah. Have you been?

12:21.616 --> 12:23.749
To the Eiffel Tower?
Yeah. So many times.

12:23.816 --> 12:25.048
Can't even count how many times.

12:26.282 --> 12:27.783
I know everything there
is to know about it.

12:32.649 --> 12:34.048
Mr. Muscles?

12:34.115 --> 12:35.749
Let me take a gander.

12:35.816 --> 12:37.649
I'm thinking professional
wrestler, maybe.

12:46.649 --> 12:47.915
I don't know. Tough to tell.

12:47.982 --> 12:49.549
Kind of nondescript, really.

12:49.616 --> 12:50.649
Don't you think?

12:50.716 --> 12:51.948
Would you excuse me for just a second?

12:52.015 --> 12:53.282
I got to use the little boys' room.

12:53.349 --> 12:54.215
Yeah.

12:54.282 --> 12:55.249
I'll be right back.

12:55.315 --> 12:56.616
- Okay.
- Okay.

13:01.082 --> 13:02.349
Hey, guys, you there?

13:02.416 --> 13:03.616
Chuck, have you flashed yet?

13:03.682 --> 13:05.182
Yeah. How did you know I'd flash?

13:05.249 --> 13:07.015
Because your mission's
not in Paris, Chuck.

13:08.149 --> 13:09.616
Your mission is on the plane.

13:13.299 --> 13:15.322
What do you mean,
my "mission is on the plane"?

13:15.375 --> 13:17.309
What do you mean,
"the mission is on the plane"?

13:17.375 --> 13:19.242
Hugo Panzer, the man you flashed on.

13:20.175 --> 13:21.242
He's a ring agent.

13:21.309 --> 13:23.342
He's moving a CIA crypto key to Paris.

13:23.409 --> 13:24.509
He'll have put it in cargo.

13:24.575 --> 13:25.975
You'll need to get his claim ticket,

13:26.042 --> 13:29.309
go to the cargo hold,
find his bag, get the key.

13:29.375 --> 13:32.676
Yeah, I'm only seeing problems
with that plan right now.

13:32.742 --> 13:35.676
Hugo Panzer is a bit on the large side.

13:35.742 --> 13:37.142
Chuck, I gave you the pen for a reason.

13:37.208 --> 13:38.409
You can do this.

13:38.475 --> 13:40.342
The pen. Of course.

13:40.409 --> 13:42.742
The pen. Tranq him, get the ticket.

13:42.808 --> 13:45.142
No problem.

13:45.208 --> 13:46.208
Chuck, please be careful.

13:46.275 --> 13:47.808
Hugo Panzer is very dangerous.

13:47.875 --> 13:50.342
He is a master at
close-quarters combat.

13:50.409 --> 13:51.776
Sarah, don't you worry.

13:51.841 --> 13:54.108
I will have that key back
before they serve the lobster.

13:54.175 --> 13:56.676
And by the way,
I'm quite looking forward to that.

13:56.742 --> 13:58.409
Hello?

13:58.475 --> 13:59.709
You should have told me.

13:59.776 --> 14:00.709
And this is why I didn't.

14:00.776 --> 14:02.175
Chuck is not ready for Paris

14:02.242 --> 14:03.742
and he's certainly not
ready for a mid-air mission.

14:03.808 --> 14:05.575
I mean, we can't even
go in and help him.

14:05.642 --> 14:08.609
Well, now we find out if
your asset is a real spy.

14:08.676 --> 14:11.175
Who are you, agent Shaw?

14:11.242 --> 14:12.808
Because, you know,
I have never heard of you,

14:12.875 --> 14:14.042
and neither has Casey.

14:14.108 --> 14:15.375
You're a very well kept secret.

14:15.442 --> 14:18.008
I do like my secrets. Don't you?

14:18.075 --> 14:19.609
Being the daughter of a con man

14:19.676 --> 14:21.242
teaches you that.

14:21.309 --> 14:22.475
You really do read everybody's files.

14:22.542 --> 14:23.609
Of course.

14:23.676 --> 14:24.875
And I have a few questions for you.

14:24.941 --> 14:28.375
Seven months ago,
when Chuck was in Prague,

14:28.442 --> 14:30.208
you went off grid for three days.

14:30.275 --> 14:34.108
This is a surveillance
photo of a hotel in Lisbon.

14:34.175 --> 14:35.275
This is you.

14:35.342 --> 14:37.676
Beckman ordered you to stay in contact,

14:37.742 --> 14:39.875
but you ran. Why?

14:39.941 --> 14:42.342
It's not what you think.

14:42.409 --> 14:43.442
I don't know what to think.

14:43.509 --> 14:44.676
Are you a double agent?

14:44.742 --> 14:46.309
A ring operative?

14:46.375 --> 14:48.042
Or is this about Chuck?

14:52.242 --> 14:54.841
Excuse me, sir?

14:54.908 --> 14:56.208
Sorry to bother you.

14:56.275 --> 14:57.941
The woman that I'm sitting
next to is a bit of a nuisance.

14:58.008 --> 14:59.808
Will not shut up.

14:59.875 --> 15:01.475
So I was kind of wondering
if I could plop down here,

15:01.542 --> 15:02.676
if that's okay.

15:04.776 --> 15:05.875
Fine.

15:05.941 --> 15:07.908
Thanks. Awesome.

15:14.442 --> 15:15.776
Yeah, you know,
I think she's an upgrade.

15:15.841 --> 15:17.475
It's such a bummer, too,

15:17.542 --> 15:19.042
because one of the things
I love about first class

15:19.108 --> 15:21.008
is the opportunity to really socialize

15:21.075 --> 15:23.841
and rub elbows with people that are,
you know, like-minded,

15:23.908 --> 15:25.575
and not the rabble.
Don't you agree?

15:30.908 --> 15:32.175
Excuse me.

15:32.242 --> 15:33.509
Oh, yeah, sure. Do your thing.

15:49.776 --> 15:51.709
Crossword time!

15:53.509 --> 15:57.208
One across, "ecru".

16:05.008 --> 16:07.442
- It's the air pressure.
- What? Huh?

16:07.509 --> 16:11.208
Pens don't always work on planes
because of the pressure change.

16:11.275 --> 16:12.908
- That... that's fascinating.
- Let me try.

16:12.975 --> 16:14.908
Oh, no, please don't...

16:16.042 --> 16:18.042
Sorry. Sorry about that. Sorry.

16:18.108 --> 16:20.309
That wasn't ink.

16:22.941 --> 16:25.742
Sir, this is first class.

16:25.808 --> 16:27.309
- Who are you?
- Nobody.

16:27.375 --> 16:28.776
Who are you?

16:39.642 --> 16:41.609
KGB.

16:57.075 --> 16:58.609
- Yeah?
- Any updates on Chuck?

16:58.676 --> 17:00.808
Relax, Casey. He's doing fine.

17:02.142 --> 17:03.776
Hey, John.

17:03.841 --> 17:05.907
Uh, do you have a second?

17:05.974 --> 17:08.309
I need a favor.

17:09.808 --> 17:10.941
Not interested.

17:11.008 --> 17:13.776
Oh, I hate to pull rank here, uh, John,

17:13.840 --> 17:16.808
but I am your superior.

17:16.875 --> 17:19.142
What?

17:19.208 --> 17:20.442
I need you.

17:20.509 --> 17:23.108
Okay, please help me.

17:23.175 --> 17:24.642
I don't know what they'll do next...

17:24.709 --> 17:26.242
Mute Lester and his gang.

17:26.309 --> 17:27.675
They've taken over the store.

17:27.742 --> 17:29.142
They set booby traps for me everywhere.

17:29.208 --> 17:30.309
I'm going crazy here.

17:30.375 --> 17:32.941
I can't fight them by myself anymore.

17:33.008 --> 17:34.375
They don't follow any rules.

17:34.442 --> 17:36.542
Insurgents?

17:37.642 --> 17:39.342
I hate insurgents.

17:39.409 --> 17:41.742
Then this will work out, I think.

18:16.575 --> 18:18.375
Hey.

18:18.442 --> 18:19.575
Hey, guys.

18:19.642 --> 18:21.008
I'm in the cargo hold,

18:21.075 --> 18:23.042
and it's friggin' freezing in here.

18:23.108 --> 18:24.275
Good job.

18:24.342 --> 18:25.509
Look for the matching ticket,

18:25.575 --> 18:27.575
find the key, get back to your seat.

18:35.841 --> 18:37.709
Come on.

18:37.776 --> 18:39.208
I'm right, aren't I?

18:39.275 --> 18:41.375
I should tell you, I'm always right.

18:41.442 --> 18:42.609
It's annoying, but true.

18:42.676 --> 18:43.941
Why don't you tell me
what you're right about

18:44.008 --> 18:45.208
so I can tell you that you're wrong?

18:45.275 --> 18:48.475
My theory about you and Chuck.

18:48.542 --> 18:51.042
Most spies push their
assets to perform.

18:51.108 --> 18:52.509
That's what I do.

18:52.575 --> 18:53.742
You protect him.

18:53.808 --> 18:55.108
You care for him.

18:55.175 --> 18:56.575
You followed him to Lisbon.

18:56.642 --> 18:58.509
- That's not true.
- Come on.

18:58.575 --> 19:00.742
I was right about this mission,
and I'm right about you.

19:00.808 --> 19:02.509
You know, Chuck isn't home free yet.

19:34.908 --> 19:36.808
- What do you got, Chuck?
- I found it.

19:36.875 --> 19:37.808
It's a casket.

19:37.875 --> 19:39.542
Smart. The ring knows

19:39.609 --> 19:41.275
that customs won't check the body.

19:41.342 --> 19:42.509
Open it up.

19:42.575 --> 19:44.375
- Find the key.
- That's kind of disgusting.

19:44.442 --> 19:46.142
Get it done, Chuck.

19:51.275 --> 19:52.342
Oh!

19:54.075 --> 19:55.342
Hi.

19:55.409 --> 19:56.808
Sorry about this.

19:56.875 --> 19:59.676
Where are you? Where is its? Ooh!

19:59.742 --> 20:01.509
Oh, dead hands. Dead, cold hands.

20:01.575 --> 20:03.542
Dead, cold.... Oh.

20:03.609 --> 20:05.142
Here we go.

20:05.208 --> 20:07.175
Ooh, that's disgusting.

20:07.242 --> 20:08.676
Gah! Dead skin, dead skin,

20:08.742 --> 20:11.008
dead skin.

20:11.075 --> 20:12.676
Jackpot.

20:23.609 --> 20:24.642
It's Chuck.

20:24.709 --> 20:26.409
Don't answer.

20:26.475 --> 20:28.642
He's taken care of Hugo.
All he has to do is find the key.

20:28.709 --> 20:29.875
He shouldn't need to call.

20:29.941 --> 20:33.409
Sarah, pick up.
Pick up your phone.

20:33.475 --> 20:34.375
And what if he's in trouble?

20:34.442 --> 20:35.875
Go ahead, answer it.

20:35.941 --> 20:38.575
Just know that if you do,
he'll never be a real spy.

20:38.642 --> 20:40.409
And one day, that will get him killed.

20:47.609 --> 20:49.676
Sorry. Sorry, old man.

20:49.742 --> 20:51.042
Sorry, old man.

21:01.409 --> 21:03.375
Don't freak out.

21:17.332 --> 21:18.831
Casey! Casey!

21:19.280 --> 21:22.780
Listen, I'm in a little
bit of a pickle right now.

21:22.847 --> 21:25.246
I am currently trapped in a coffin

21:25.313 --> 21:26.613
with a recently deceased

21:26.680 --> 21:29.680
elderly man and a very large
bad guy trying to find me.

21:29.747 --> 21:31.380
Aren't you still on the plane?

21:31.447 --> 21:32.980
Right, yes,
I forgot to mention that part.

21:33.047 --> 21:34.447
The mission is on the plane.

21:34.513 --> 21:35.780
I have the key,

21:35.847 --> 21:37.880
but the ring operative
is right outside.

21:37.947 --> 21:40.147
- What do I do?
- You get taken.

21:40.213 --> 21:41.947
What?!

21:42.014 --> 21:43.914
The ring agent's gonna find you,
because you picked

21:43.980 --> 21:45.447
the single dumbest place to hide.

21:45.513 --> 21:47.513
Oh, gee, thanks.
Criticism is always welcome.

21:47.580 --> 21:50.147
When he does, you act like
your little girlish self.

21:50.213 --> 21:52.513
You scream like a banshee,
so he doesn't think you're a threat.

21:54.114 --> 21:56.380
When he pulls you out,
you find a weapon and then flash.

21:56.447 --> 21:57.680
Well, what if I don't flash?

21:57.747 --> 21:59.513
Then you're dead... So flash.

21:59.580 --> 22:00.680
C... Casey...

22:03.914 --> 22:05.213
Chuck! Chuck!

22:10.413 --> 22:11.880
Yeah, Casey?

22:11.947 --> 22:13.847
Walker, Bartowski's in trouble.

22:13.914 --> 22:15.047
The ring operative has him.

22:15.114 --> 22:17.346
What? Chuck's been taken.

22:18.413 --> 22:20.181
I'm opening a line to his phone.

22:22.413 --> 22:25.047
I sincerely hope that
that's not your father.

22:25.114 --> 22:25.814
Oh!

22:29.313 --> 22:31.380
You should've taken my watch.

22:31.447 --> 22:33.081
My employer demands
a certain heart rate

22:33.147 --> 22:34.547
when I'm on the job.

22:34.613 --> 22:37.413
Got a little present for you.

22:42.814 --> 22:45.246
They really are a fencing team.

22:49.181 --> 22:51.313
Why don't you just come here?

22:51.380 --> 22:52.947
I'll do this clean.

22:53.014 --> 22:54.114
Easy.

22:54.181 --> 22:55.114
No pain.

22:57.280 --> 22:59.447
Please be in the Intersect.

23:07.346 --> 23:08.847
En garde.

23:11.680 --> 23:13.181
- Point.
- What's the matter with you?

23:13.246 --> 23:15.246
You know you're gonna die.

23:39.747 --> 23:40.980
You missed.

23:41.047 --> 23:42.313
A lot.

23:51.081 --> 23:54.047
Chuck, Chuck, what's happening?

23:54.114 --> 23:55.313
Hey, guys,

23:55.380 --> 23:56.647
I'm still alive,

23:56.714 --> 23:59.647
and my first solo mission
was a success.

24:02.513 --> 24:05.380
Buckle up, Buy More-ians,
it's gonna be a bumpy ride.

24:05.447 --> 24:08.213
Meet my new lieutenant...
Assistant Manager, John Casey.

24:08.280 --> 24:11.014
You guys know John from appliances.

24:11.081 --> 24:14.181
Or maybe you remember him

24:14.246 --> 24:15.413
from the volleyball incident

24:15.480 --> 24:17.313
at last year's employee picnic.

24:17.380 --> 24:18.647
Either way, for those of you

24:18.714 --> 24:20.380
who are willing to abandon the plot

24:20.447 --> 24:23.014
to sabotage me in my
assistant managership,

24:23.081 --> 24:24.380
you're free to go.

24:27.747 --> 24:30.547
Well, well, well,

24:30.613 --> 24:33.014
lookie what we have here.

24:33.081 --> 24:35.014
This is a no-smoking store.

24:35.081 --> 24:35.880
Thanks, Jeff.

24:35.947 --> 24:37.081
Do you know what, my lieutenant

24:37.147 --> 24:38.847
has the right to smoke
a cigar if he wants.

24:38.914 --> 24:40.580
Or he can put it out.

24:40.647 --> 24:42.613
Mr. Casey.

24:46.313 --> 24:47.947
Anyone else want to leave?

24:52.280 --> 24:53.714
Anything you got to say, big guy?

24:56.213 --> 24:57.947
Lester says

24:58.014 --> 25:00.246
this... isn't over.

25:00.313 --> 25:01.246
Does he?

25:09.980 --> 25:12.081
And I know it sounds outrageous,

25:12.147 --> 25:14.880
but the Eiffel Tower's most
amazing engineering feat

25:14.947 --> 25:16.647
is the elevator itself...

25:16.714 --> 25:19.380
And with that, I realize
I'm the most boring person

25:19.447 --> 25:22.680
- in the world.
- No, no, that was an amazing story.

25:22.747 --> 25:25.114
And-and I really like your model.

25:25.181 --> 25:26.413
Thanks.

25:26.480 --> 25:27.880
It was a...

25:27.947 --> 25:29.647
gift from my dad.

25:30.980 --> 25:33.413
Can I ask you a personal question?

25:34.914 --> 25:36.213
Sure.

25:36.280 --> 25:38.580
Have you ever been to Paris, Chuck?

25:39.814 --> 25:41.747
Of course.

25:41.814 --> 25:43.947
That's a...

25:46.980 --> 25:48.780
- No, I haven't.
- It's just that

25:48.847 --> 25:50.947
you talked about it with such wonder,

25:51.014 --> 25:53.280
like someone who's
always wanted to go.

25:53.346 --> 25:54.780
No one in first class

25:54.847 --> 25:57.014
ever wants to do anything that badly.

25:57.081 --> 25:59.714
You're different; you stand out.

26:02.213 --> 26:03.814
Thank you.

26:03.880 --> 26:05.480
This is all kind of new to me.

26:05.547 --> 26:07.680
I think I just wanted to fit in,
you know?

26:07.747 --> 26:11.213
Why? What's your secret, Chuck?

26:13.680 --> 26:17.213
Uh, the truth is,
I work at the Buy More in Burbank.

26:17.280 --> 26:19.114
You know, the...

26:19.181 --> 26:20.747
Uh,

26:20.814 --> 26:22.447
in the Nerd Herd department.

26:22.513 --> 26:24.613
I did a home theater
install at this guy's house

26:24.680 --> 26:26.880
in LA, and, uh, he liked it so much

26:26.947 --> 26:28.947
that he wanted me to do the same thing

26:29.014 --> 26:31.246
in his home in Paris.

26:31.313 --> 26:33.181
So here I am.

26:33.246 --> 26:36.346
His ticket...
I'm just along for the ride.

26:36.413 --> 26:39.814
I don't really belong in Paris,

26:39.880 --> 26:43.346
or... first class, for that matter.

26:43.413 --> 26:44.380
That's not true.

26:44.447 --> 26:46.914
Do you want to know my secret?

26:46.980 --> 26:49.380
Is it scary?

26:50.914 --> 26:53.081
No. Um...

26:53.147 --> 26:55.980
I just got fired from my job.

26:56.047 --> 26:58.213
I thought I'd actually convinced them

26:58.280 --> 27:00.081
to let me stay, but...

27:00.147 --> 27:02.513
I am now officially flying to Paris

27:02.580 --> 27:04.280
to empty out my office.

27:04.346 --> 27:06.047
I'm so sorry.

27:06.114 --> 27:08.147
It's okay.

27:08.213 --> 27:11.580
Meeting you almost makes it worth it.

27:21.447 --> 27:22.947
Mama?

27:37.747 --> 27:40.081
Uh-uh-uh, you're not here,

27:40.147 --> 27:41.980
you're still sleeping.

27:42.047 --> 27:44.547
You're still in bed.

27:44.613 --> 27:46.513
Just relax.

27:46.580 --> 27:49.114
Just watch the red dot.

27:51.747 --> 27:54.280
This is your boss.

27:54.346 --> 27:57.047
Morgan is your boss.

27:57.114 --> 28:00.014
Morgan is your boss.

28:01.047 --> 28:03.181
Morgan is your boss.

28:03.246 --> 28:05.047
Morgan is my boss.

28:05.114 --> 28:07.914
Morgan is Lester's boss.

28:07.980 --> 28:10.647
Morgan is Lester's boss.

28:10.714 --> 28:12.346
That's right.

28:12.413 --> 28:15.280
You're happy that Morgan is your boss.

28:15.346 --> 28:16.280
Wait.

28:16.346 --> 28:17.980
This Morgan person is real?

28:18.047 --> 28:20.081
This store you work in,
it actually exists?

28:20.147 --> 28:22.313
Yeah, oh, yeah.
Yes to both of those things.

28:22.380 --> 28:24.447
Although, even personally,
I have quite often wondered

28:24.513 --> 28:27.680
if the Buy More was really
an insane asylum, but yeah.

28:32.580 --> 28:34.714
What is it?

28:34.780 --> 28:36.513
Uh...

28:36.580 --> 28:40.814
Uh, that-that, uh, that drink,
I don't remember... ordering it.

28:40.880 --> 28:42.147
It just

28:42.213 --> 28:43.680
kind of appeared out of nowhere.

28:43.747 --> 28:45.880
A... and you drank it.

28:48.647 --> 28:50.747
Are you okay?

28:50.814 --> 28:52.313
Yeah.

28:52.380 --> 28:54.580
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine.

28:54.647 --> 28:57.680
Just tasted a little... a little funny.

28:57.747 --> 29:00.313
Yeah, you look like
you've been poisoned.

29:01.827 --> 29:02.955
That's crazy.

29:20.564 --> 29:21.801
Chuck? Is something wrong?

29:22.002 --> 29:23.302
I've just been poisoned!

29:23.369 --> 29:24.536
Someone just poisoned me!

29:24.602 --> 29:26.736
I think it was Hugo.
I tied him up downstairs

29:26.803 --> 29:28.335
in the cargo hold,
but somehow he escaped!

29:28.402 --> 29:30.235
- What did it taste like?
- It was very complex.

29:30.302 --> 29:32.035
It had a strong nose,
with hints of apple,

29:32.102 --> 29:33.235
and then a very sour finish.

29:33.302 --> 29:34.335
He's right, it's poison.

29:34.402 --> 29:35.903
Chuck, you have to throw up.

29:35.968 --> 29:37.002
That's disgusting.

29:37.068 --> 29:38.302
Just do it right now.

29:38.369 --> 29:40.002
Busy!

29:40.068 --> 29:42.335
It's Hugo... He is coming for me.

29:43.369 --> 29:44.669
Sir, are you okay?

29:44.736 --> 29:46.002
Do you need any help?

29:46.068 --> 29:47.302
Sorry, Mexican food.

29:47.369 --> 29:49.335
You do not want to come in here.

29:49.402 --> 29:51.569
Scream, and you're dead.

29:52.869 --> 29:53.402
Chuck?

29:53.469 --> 29:54.569
I am so writing

29:54.636 --> 29:56.369
a letter to the airline about this.

29:56.436 --> 29:59.402
Shut up. There's only one
antidote for that poison,

29:59.469 --> 30:00.869
and I have it.

30:00.935 --> 30:03.335
Now, right now, you're feeling queasy.

30:03.402 --> 30:05.502
In an hour, you'll be in more pain

30:05.569 --> 30:07.002
than you could possibly imagine.

30:07.068 --> 30:08.169
Okay, fine. What do you want?

30:08.235 --> 30:10.068
The key! Now!

30:10.135 --> 30:11.235
What key?

30:11.302 --> 30:13.935
Ooh! Oh, th... the key.

30:14.002 --> 30:15.536
You have it; I want it.

30:15.602 --> 30:16.736
Give it to me.

30:16.803 --> 30:17.935
And don't lie.

30:18.002 --> 30:19.269
I'll kill you right here.

30:19.335 --> 30:22.102
I have the key, but I don't
have it on me... I hid it

30:22.169 --> 30:23.736
down in the cargo hold.

30:27.736 --> 30:29.702
Go on.

30:32.769 --> 30:33.736
Oh.

30:33.803 --> 30:34.636
Hi.

30:35.335 --> 30:36.035
Ooh!

30:37.636 --> 30:39.035
Isn't poisoning me enough?

30:41.135 --> 30:42.269
Now,

30:42.335 --> 30:43.369
where's the key?

30:43.436 --> 30:44.736
Antidote first.

30:44.803 --> 30:46.135
Is this your first mission?

30:46.202 --> 30:46.935
Maybe.

30:48.176 --> 30:48.968
You led my agent

30:49.035 --> 30:51.169
into a mission with
two ring operatives?

30:51.235 --> 30:53.269
- He's going to make it.
- How?

30:53.335 --> 30:54.436
Watch.

30:54.502 --> 30:56.803
This is Blackbriar to Crystal Palace.

30:56.869 --> 30:57.968
Do you have me, Palace?

30:58.035 --> 30:59.402
Copy that. I need to initiate

30:59.469 --> 31:00.769
an executive office override.

31:00.836 --> 31:02.636
Put sentry satellite into inverse orbit

31:02.702 --> 31:04.302
over Millennium Atlantic flight 3923.

31:04.369 --> 31:05.335
Standing by for 3923...

31:05.402 --> 31:07.135
What are you doing?

31:07.202 --> 31:09.669
Four years ago, we launched a satellite

31:09.736 --> 31:12.269
designed to take control
of enemy fighters.

31:12.335 --> 31:14.669
Surprisingly, the thing actually works.

31:14.736 --> 31:15.803
You're a pilot, right?

31:15.869 --> 31:17.436
You're gonna take control
of that plane?

31:17.502 --> 31:18.669
That's a 747.

31:18.736 --> 31:21.669
I hope you're a quick learner...
Captain Walker.

31:29.836 --> 31:32.135
Call Chuck.

31:36.269 --> 31:39.235
All right, I work for the CIA, okay?

31:39.302 --> 31:41.269
And that's my boss.

31:41.335 --> 31:44.602
I cannot give up the key
without his authorization first.

31:44.669 --> 31:47.968
Answer it. On speaker.

31:49.669 --> 31:50.935
Hi, guys.

31:51.002 --> 31:53.536
If you're wondering,
I'm doing just dandy.

31:53.602 --> 31:54.536
Aside from being

31:54.602 --> 31:55.736
captured, poisoned

31:55.803 --> 31:58.102
and repeatedly socked in the gut!

31:58.169 --> 31:59.335
I have your agent.

31:59.402 --> 32:01.869
- Order him to give me the key.
- Who is this?

32:01.935 --> 32:03.169
I work for a third party,

32:03.235 --> 32:05.436
and my employer doesn't
tolerate failure.

32:05.502 --> 32:08.836
Now, your man...

32:08.903 --> 32:11.636
Oh, Chuck. Seat 2B.

32:11.702 --> 32:14.569
...Chuck here will be dead in an hour.

32:14.636 --> 32:16.035
But I'm in a rush,

32:16.102 --> 32:17.169
so he gives me the key

32:17.235 --> 32:18.502
or I kill him now.

32:18.569 --> 32:19.536
Okay.

32:21.102 --> 32:22.536
O... okay?

32:22.602 --> 32:23.702
Did he just say...
Did you just say...?

32:23.769 --> 32:25.068
I think you meant to say,

32:25.135 --> 32:28.569
"Please don't kill my
good friend Chuck".

32:30.068 --> 32:31.502
What type of poison are you using?

32:31.569 --> 32:34.502
I'm not bluffing.
This is a cyanide hybrid.

32:34.569 --> 32:35.968
Cyanide hybrid!

32:36.035 --> 32:38.068
You've used it before in Berlin.

32:38.135 --> 32:39.636
What?

32:39.702 --> 32:42.068
Serena, you used that
same poison to take out

32:42.135 --> 32:43.669
the Syrian ambassador, and I know

32:43.736 --> 32:44.903
you work for the ring.

32:45.935 --> 32:47.903
How do you know this?

32:47.968 --> 32:49.235
Don't worry about that.

32:49.302 --> 32:51.436
Do what I say.
Give my agent the antidote,

32:51.502 --> 32:53.502
and I'll let you and your
gorillas slide on this one.

32:53.569 --> 32:55.068
Who are you?

32:55.135 --> 32:56.068
Serena, you can do this.

32:56.135 --> 32:57.235
Let him go.

32:57.302 --> 33:01.235
I can't. You know my employer.

33:01.302 --> 33:04.702
Your agent is alone
and he's going to die.

33:04.769 --> 33:08.068
No, my people are never alone. Now.

33:13.169 --> 33:14.402
Disengaging yaw damper.

33:18.102 --> 33:19.235
Inducing negative Gs.

33:32.135 --> 33:33.702
We've run into a patch of turbulence.

33:33.769 --> 33:36.602
Please return to your seats right now.

33:42.769 --> 33:45.436
You shot a gun on a plane?!
Are you crazy?!

34:07.402 --> 34:09.168
Sarah, level off

34:09.235 --> 34:10.803
- the plane now!
- Got it.

34:23.202 --> 34:24.302
Ah...

34:24.967 --> 34:25.369
Ah!

34:36.168 --> 34:37.436
Hey,

34:37.502 --> 34:40.369
I'm alive and I have the key.

34:41.935 --> 34:44.202
Unfortunately,
I did not get to use my nunchakus.

34:45.606 --> 34:47.206
This is Blackbriar to Crystal Palace.

34:47.272 --> 34:48.272
Disable link on my mark.

34:48.339 --> 34:49.272
Copy that.

34:49.339 --> 34:51.005
Three, two, one. Break.

34:51.072 --> 34:52.239
Uplink terminated.

34:52.306 --> 34:54.072
Thank you, Palace.

34:54.139 --> 34:57.373
Well, the flight crew will never even
know we were there.

34:57.439 --> 34:59.773
Just another day in the office.

35:03.139 --> 35:05.406
I do everything
I can to protect my people.

35:05.473 --> 35:07.673
I lost one spy.

35:07.740 --> 35:09.206
It was my fault.

35:09.272 --> 35:11.139
And it will never happen again.

35:13.806 --> 35:15.939
Why were you in Lisbon?

35:20.272 --> 35:22.773
I went to bury Bryce, my partner.

35:22.840 --> 35:26.239
He wanted his ashes there.

35:26.306 --> 35:28.905
Lisbon was our first mission.

35:28.972 --> 35:30.606
I knew I wasn't supposed to leave,

35:30.673 --> 35:36.306
but I promised him that
I would take care of it, so I did.

35:36.373 --> 35:38.272
If you want me out, just tell Beckman

35:38.339 --> 35:40.072
and she will reassign me.

35:40.139 --> 35:41.539
Why would I do that?

35:41.606 --> 35:43.139
I need you.

35:43.206 --> 35:44.406
I just had to be sure

35:44.473 --> 35:46.039
that the ring hadn't
gotten to you already.

35:46.106 --> 35:47.306
And now do you believe me?

35:47.373 --> 35:49.606
Every word, Sarah.

36:01.439 --> 36:02.939
How are you feeling?

36:03.005 --> 36:05.773
Um, much better, thanks.

36:05.840 --> 36:07.639
Sorry about that whole
airsickness episode.

36:07.706 --> 36:09.172
It wasn't my finest hour.

36:09.239 --> 36:10.606
No, it's okay.

36:10.673 --> 36:12.673
Chuck, I'm gonna be here
for a couple of days

36:12.740 --> 36:14.072
clearing things up.

36:14.139 --> 36:17.005
I would love it if I could show
off the Eiffel Tower to you.

36:17.072 --> 36:18.806
What do you say?

36:18.872 --> 36:20.872
Absolutely. That would be amazing.

36:20.939 --> 36:21.939
Great.

36:24.239 --> 36:25.406
Oh.

36:27.306 --> 36:28.506
Hello.

36:28.573 --> 36:30.439
Chuck, our Paris station
is taking over custody

36:30.506 --> 36:31.506
of the ring operatives.

36:31.573 --> 36:33.272
They send their compliments.

36:33.339 --> 36:35.506
- Fantastic. That is great news.
- Another thing,

36:35.573 --> 36:38.206
stay on the plane.
We need that key back in Burbank ASAP.

36:38.272 --> 36:41.339
Uh...

36:42.373 --> 36:43.673
Really? I can't...?

36:43.740 --> 36:45.872
Mission's over, Chuck.
Time to come home.

36:48.939 --> 36:51.306
What is it?

36:51.373 --> 36:55.039
Um, the install job I was
gonna do here in Paris

36:55.106 --> 36:58.239
has been canceled, so Buy More
needs me back immediately.

36:58.306 --> 37:00.005
I have to stay on the plane.

37:00.072 --> 37:01.872
What about Paris?

37:01.939 --> 37:03.740
Don't worry about it.
It's... it's no big deal.

37:03.806 --> 37:06.005
I'll get back here eventually.

37:06.072 --> 37:08.039
And, uh, and furthermore, uh...

37:09.939 --> 37:14.339
Hannah, if, um, if you ever
find yourself in Burbank,

37:14.406 --> 37:15.840
and I don't know what the chances

37:15.905 --> 37:17.272
of you finding yourself in Burbank are,

37:17.339 --> 37:18.972
but if you do find yourself in Burbank,

37:19.039 --> 37:20.172
and you're still without a job,

37:20.239 --> 37:22.172
my assistant manager owes me

37:22.239 --> 37:24.393
about a million-and-a-half favors.

37:25.178 --> 37:26.093
Although, I have to warn you,

37:26.093 --> 37:27.526
you will be terribly overqualified

37:27.593 --> 37:28.927
for the job.

37:32.129 --> 37:33.063
Thank you.

37:33.129 --> 37:34.163
Oh, you're welcome.

37:35.262 --> 37:38.067
It was a pleasure to meet you, Hannah.

37:38.067 --> 37:40.301
It was great to meet you, too, Chuck.

37:41.900 --> 37:43.367
Bye.

37:43.433 --> 37:44.967
Au revoir.

38:18.867 --> 38:23.234
Lester, dude, what are we going to do?

38:25.401 --> 38:29.067
About Morgan and his new goon?

38:29.134 --> 38:30.234
Morgan?

38:30.301 --> 38:33.000
Yeah. How are we gonna get back at him?

38:33.067 --> 38:36.934
Morgan Grimes is the kindest,
warmest, most understanding

38:37.000 --> 38:39.667
human being I've ever known in my life.

38:46.533 --> 38:49.000
Whoa, that is too cool.

38:49.067 --> 38:50.833
How did you do that?

38:50.900 --> 38:53.600
Don't ask. Plausible deniability.

38:53.667 --> 38:55.633
Plausible deniability.

38:55.700 --> 38:57.900
Yeah, of course, of course.

38:57.967 --> 38:59.700
Your key, sir.

38:59.767 --> 39:02.100
Very good, Chuck.
Your first solo mission.

39:02.167 --> 39:03.633
I am impressed.

39:03.700 --> 39:07.034
Well, thank you, but I would be dead
if it wasn't for you guys.

39:08.167 --> 39:09.433
All right, who wants

39:09.500 --> 39:11.733
to see if this key works?

39:19.367 --> 39:20.967
What is it, a weapon?

39:21.034 --> 39:22.867
No, it's a lockbox.

39:22.934 --> 39:24.867
Belonged to a spy
I had inside the ring.

39:24.934 --> 39:26.800
It's all of the intel the agent had.

39:38.100 --> 39:42.367
With this we might stand a chance.

39:42.433 --> 39:46.167
And one of our best didn't die in vain.

40:06.401 --> 40:08.234
What's in the envelope, Shaw?

40:26.600 --> 40:29.500
She was killed by a ring
agent five years ago.

40:29.566 --> 40:32.533
Her name was Evelyn Shaw.

40:32.600 --> 40:33.767
Eve.

40:35.134 --> 40:38.234
We both made the same mistake, Sarah.

40:38.301 --> 40:40.566
We fell in love with spies.

41:06.800 --> 41:08.433
What's with the looks?

41:08.500 --> 41:10.234
He gave me a raise.

41:10.301 --> 41:11.633
Inflation, buddy.
See what happens

41:11.700 --> 41:13.466
when you go away for a two-day install?

41:13.533 --> 41:14.700
Everything changes.

41:14.767 --> 41:16.234
Ah, I don't know.

41:16.301 --> 41:19.334
Sometimes I think
everything just stays the same.

41:19.401 --> 41:21.301
But maybe that's just me.

41:21.367 --> 41:22.934
Chuck, what happened on the install?

41:23.000 --> 41:25.667
Nothing, buddy.

41:25.733 --> 41:27.267
Nothing at all.

41:27.334 --> 41:28.767
Bored now.
