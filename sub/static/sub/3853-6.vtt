WEBVTT

00:00.001 --> 00:01.890
[narrator]
previously on dark matter.

00:01.891 --> 00:03.780
[one] we all woke up
just like you,

00:03.781 --> 00:05.670
No memories, no idea who
we are or how we got here.

00:05.673 --> 00:08.173
The crew of this ship
is supposed to be dead,

00:08.175 --> 00:10.376
Definitely not supposed to be
diseased cannibal monsters.

00:10.378 --> 00:11.610
[six]
that's a nasty gash.

00:15.149 --> 00:17.166
[six] she has all our
memories in her head!

00:17.167 --> 00:19.184
[two] she's been having dreams..
Dreams she thinks might be memos

00:19.186 --> 00:21.153
Except that they're not just he.

00:21.155 --> 00:22.321
[two]
alpha-numeric lock code.

00:22.323 --> 00:23.655
[one] which none
of us can remember.

00:23.657 --> 00:25.624
[three] you ever dream
about the code, kid?

00:25.626 --> 00:27.393
[five]
no.

00:27.394 --> 00:29.161
[three] yeah but it's still ratg
around in your head, isn't it?

00:33.501 --> 00:35.667
[man]
the emperor is dead!

00:35.669 --> 00:38.670
[woman]
you will pay for this.

00:38.672 --> 00:40.439
[man]
find the prince!

00:40.441 --> 00:42.074
Arrest him!

00:47.615 --> 00:50.682
[man] hiding in
the shadows like a rat.

00:50.684 --> 00:52.284
Take him.

00:53.487 --> 00:54.653
[sword unsheathing]

00:54.654 --> 00:55.820
[sword slicing]
[blood squirting]

00:55.823 --> 00:58.057
[men grunt in pain]
uuuggggh.

00:58.059 --> 00:59.825
[sword falls to ground]

00:59.827 --> 01:02.494
[blood dripping]
drip... Drip... Drip

01:02.496 --> 01:04.229
[sword slices through air]

01:18.345 --> 01:19.725
[five panting]

01:19.726 --> 01:21.106
[two] something's not right,
it's happening again.

01:21.107 --> 01:22.487
[heart rate monitor beeping rap]
beep, beep, beep, beep

01:22.488 --> 01:23.868
[two]
heart rate's spiking.

01:23.869 --> 01:25.249
Brain wave activity
is off the charts.

01:25.252 --> 01:26.318
She's in trouble.

01:26.320 --> 01:28.387
[five continues panting]

01:38.499 --> 01:40.766
[raza whooshes through space]

01:41.769 --> 01:44.636
[two] there was a bit
of a problem with the job.

01:45.473 --> 01:47.706
[talbor]
what kind of a problem?

01:47.708 --> 01:50.676
The ship was destroyed.

01:50.678 --> 01:52.811
Are you kidding me?

01:52.813 --> 01:55.447
Wait, is this some
kind of a sick joke?

01:55.449 --> 01:58.417
To be more precise,
we blew it up.

01:58.419 --> 01:59.818
You blew it up?

01:59.820 --> 02:01.653
You blew the ship up?!

02:01.655 --> 02:02.855
That's right.

02:02.857 --> 02:05.424
I imagine your client's
going to be angry.

02:05.426 --> 02:07.793
Oh yeah, i think,
maybe ju-just a little.

02:07.795 --> 02:10.329
Angry enough to string you up,
cut your heart out

02:10.331 --> 02:12.798
And show it to you
while it's still beating?

02:12.800 --> 02:14.566
Because that's
what i'm gonna do.

02:16.403 --> 02:16.869
Well--

02:18.739 --> 02:21.707
Okay, that's a whole lot of
hostility coming out of nowhere.

02:21.709 --> 02:24.810
Given, you know, that
i'm the aggrieved party here.

02:24.812 --> 02:26.545
You lied to us.

02:26.547 --> 02:27.930
No, i never lied.

02:27.931 --> 02:29.314
You didn't think it
was worth mentioning

02:29.316 --> 02:31.316
That the far horizon
was a plague ship?

02:31.318 --> 02:33.318
That this was all
about some failed attempts

02:33.320 --> 02:34.753
To create an immortality drug?

02:37.558 --> 02:39.458
Okay, first of all,
neglecting to mention

02:39.460 --> 02:41.460
Certain details is
not the same as lying.

02:41.462 --> 02:42.728
Just wanna point that out.

02:42.730 --> 02:46.231
And secondly, if i'd
told you about the virus,

02:46.233 --> 02:47.766
You wouldn't
have taken the job.

02:47.768 --> 02:50.402
So... Sue me.

02:54.408 --> 02:57.409
[two]
i'm not buying it.

02:57.411 --> 02:58.694
[one]
what do you mean?

02:58.695 --> 02:59.978
If he really wanted
us to get that ship,

02:59.979 --> 03:01.262
He would've
warned us about the virus,

03:01.263 --> 03:02.546
So we could've
at least gone in prepared.

03:02.550 --> 03:04.316
[six] you're saying
he wanted us to fail?

03:04.318 --> 03:05.450
[two scoffs]
pfft

03:05.452 --> 03:07.753
Ferrous wants
our heads, right?

03:07.755 --> 03:09.922
Maybe they offered him
something to take us out.

03:09.924 --> 03:11.924
[four] perhaps, he thought
he could win either way.

03:11.926 --> 03:13.959
If we succeed,
he gets the salvage.

03:13.961 --> 03:16.195
If we're killed,
ferrous pays him off.

03:16.197 --> 03:18.230
[six] you know what
the real problem is?

03:18.232 --> 03:19.865
Even if all this is true,

03:19.867 --> 03:23.769
He's still the closest
thing we have to a friend.

03:23.771 --> 03:26.371
[one] what's our
supply situation?

03:26.373 --> 03:28.607
[two] bad, bordering
on desperate.

03:28.609 --> 03:30.876
We've got enough fuel
to reach the outer colonies.

03:30.878 --> 03:33.645
There's not much law out
there, so we'd probably be safe.

03:33.647 --> 03:34.947
But we don't
have enough food.

03:34.949 --> 03:37.416
We'd have to go
back in the stasis pods

03:37.418 --> 03:38.917
To even make it that far.

03:38.919 --> 03:41.787
[three] after what happened
last time, not a chance.

03:41.789 --> 03:44.656
[four] and what would
we do when we get there?

03:44.658 --> 03:46.825
Find some work,
if we're lucky.

03:46.827 --> 03:49.828
If not... Sell the ship.

03:49.830 --> 03:52.364
[three] which is what i have
been saying from the start,

03:52.366 --> 03:54.499
Thank you very much.

03:54.501 --> 03:55.801
[one] you said
you'd never do that.

03:55.803 --> 03:57.769
Believe me, i don't want to

03:57.771 --> 04:00.906
But i'm starting to think that
we may not have a choice.

04:07.681 --> 04:09.615
So, what's up?

04:09.617 --> 04:12.784
Well, technically this
is none of my business,

04:12.786 --> 04:15.754
Although we are a small
group of people forced to live

04:15.756 --> 04:18.924
In close quarters, so really
it's everyone's business, but--

04:18.926 --> 04:20.592
What are
you talking about?

04:23.998 --> 04:26.732
When three and i were on
the freighter, it was,

04:26.734 --> 04:30.569
Kind of a
life-or-death situation,

04:30.571 --> 04:32.871
And sometimes in those
moments people say things,

04:32.873 --> 04:34.973
And they're not necessarily--

04:34.975 --> 04:36.675
You're talking
about the fact that

04:36.677 --> 04:38.410
Three and i slept together.

04:40.981 --> 04:43.649
Okay so,
what's the problem?

04:46.620 --> 04:47.853
Obviously,
you're both adults,

04:47.855 --> 04:50.522
And you can do
whatever you want, i just--

04:52.293 --> 04:54.459
I-i found it
a little surprising.

04:55.963 --> 04:59.031
Look, not that i have to
explain myself to you, or--

04:59.033 --> 05:00.866
No, hey--

05:00.868 --> 05:02.434
Wait, shut up.

05:04.672 --> 05:07.806
I'm not even exactly
sure why i did it.

05:07.808 --> 05:09.841
I was restless
and feeling lonely and...

05:11.845 --> 05:13.712
...He was just there.

05:16.050 --> 05:17.316
Okay.

05:19.553 --> 05:20.619
Sure.

05:22.890 --> 05:23.989
That's it?

05:25.526 --> 05:28.560
The thing is, with a guy
like that you know there are

05:28.562 --> 05:31.496
Never going to be
any complications.

05:31.498 --> 05:35.000
Right now, i don't have
room for complications.

05:39.540 --> 05:44.710
So you're saying with
someone else there might be--

05:44.712 --> 05:45.911
Complications.

05:45.913 --> 05:46.945
Exactly.

05:46.947 --> 05:49.614
Yes.

05:49.616 --> 05:50.615
Okay.

05:55.522 --> 05:56.588
All right.

06:00.861 --> 06:01.827
Hey.

06:01.829 --> 06:03.028
Hey.

06:03.030 --> 06:04.847
You busy?

06:04.848 --> 06:06.665
I'm just going over some
fuel consumption numbers.

06:06.667 --> 06:10.068
But uhh...
It can-- it can wait.

06:10.070 --> 06:11.370
Come in.

06:18.846 --> 06:21.680
You really think there might
be treasure in that vault?

06:21.682 --> 06:24.449
Well, until we can
figure out a way to get in,

06:24.451 --> 06:26.885
There's no way
to know for sure.

06:26.887 --> 06:28.387
What if there is a way?

06:28.389 --> 06:30.155
What are you talking about?

06:30.156 --> 06:31.922
Well, i've been checking
out some of the equipment

06:31.925 --> 06:34.993
In the infirmary, you know
how i like to fiddle.

06:34.995 --> 06:37.396
Anyway, with
the android's help,

06:37.398 --> 06:41.066
I think i might be able to adapt
some of the medical equipment

06:41.068 --> 06:43.602
To work as a
kind of mind probe.

06:43.604 --> 06:46.071
And who's mind
would we be probing?

06:46.073 --> 06:47.572
Mine.

06:47.574 --> 06:49.441
I've got all your memories
in my head, i know it.

06:49.443 --> 06:51.943
But they're jumbled up and
they don't make any sense.

06:51.945 --> 06:53.945
So, if i could
just find a way--

06:53.947 --> 06:55.814
No listen, this sounds
way too dangerous.

06:55.816 --> 06:58.083
We'll find another way
to get into the vault.

07:25.145 --> 07:27.212
I don't want to
watch that happen.

07:31.051 --> 07:32.801
[six] are we sure
this is right?

07:32.802 --> 07:34.552
[three] if she wants to
volunteer, let her volunteer.

07:34.555 --> 07:37.055
[one] oh, so now you wanna
treat her like an adult?

07:37.057 --> 07:39.090
Hey, i'm not
the one who gave her

07:39.092 --> 07:41.092
A vote in how things
go around here.

07:41.094 --> 07:42.828
You can't
have it both ways.

07:44.131 --> 07:46.998
So how's this gonna work?

07:47.000 --> 07:50.068
[android] she'll experience
the hidden memories like a drea,

07:50.070 --> 07:53.205
Like she's a passenger
inside someone else's body.

07:53.207 --> 07:55.540
All she has to do is observe,

07:55.542 --> 07:57.876
And remember
as much as possible.

07:57.878 --> 07:58.977
[one]
will it hurt?

07:58.979 --> 08:00.929
[android]
it shouldn't.

08:00.930 --> 08:02.880
But i feel it necessary
to point out that the equipment

08:02.883 --> 08:04.883
Is not designed
to be used this way.

08:04.885 --> 08:07.486
[five]
i know, i know.

08:07.488 --> 08:09.488
We'll be monitoring
your vital signs.

08:09.490 --> 08:11.890
If anything goes wrong,
we'll pull you out.

08:15.562 --> 08:16.962
I'm ready.

08:25.239 --> 08:29.574
[machine scanning]

08:29.576 --> 08:33.211
¶ suspenseful music ¶

08:33.213 --> 08:37.883
[five breathing heavily]

08:42.155 --> 08:45.156
[male kendo instructor] you must
remember to always ground yours.

08:45.158 --> 08:46.892
Understand?

08:46.894 --> 08:48.560
Good, that's it.

08:52.533 --> 08:53.231
Again.

08:53.967 --> 08:54.900
[shinai banging]

08:54.902 --> 09:00.639
[kenshi grunting]

09:00.641 --> 09:01.773
Stop.

09:04.545 --> 09:06.278
Not like this.

09:06.280 --> 09:07.779
Like this.

09:07.781 --> 09:09.398
[female kenshi]
yes, sir.

09:09.399 --> 09:11.016
[male kendo instructor]
always watch your opponent.

09:11.018 --> 09:15.153
Do not look at his eyes
but look at his feet, his hips.

09:15.155 --> 09:17.889
It will tell you
where he's moving.

09:17.891 --> 09:20.058
Understand, hmm?

09:23.096 --> 09:24.195
Again.

09:24.197 --> 09:32.037
[shinai banging]
[kenshi grunting]

09:32.039 --> 09:33.138
[emperor]
ryo!

09:37.344 --> 09:40.145
Why did you hesitate?

09:40.147 --> 09:42.013
I won the point.

09:42.015 --> 09:43.949
There was
no need to strike.

09:49.856 --> 09:51.856
What is it you think
you're learning here?

09:51.858 --> 09:54.259
Swordsmanship,
father.

09:54.261 --> 09:55.994
No.

09:55.996 --> 09:57.963
You're learning discipline.

09:57.965 --> 10:01.333
[emperor grunting]
[shinai banging]

10:01.335 --> 10:05.103
[five as four panting]

10:05.105 --> 10:08.373
You're learning to respect
our ways and traditions.

10:13.914 --> 10:17.382
When you are emperor, and your
enemies find you vulnerable,

10:17.384 --> 10:19.250
Do you think
they will hesitate?

10:19.252 --> 10:21.653
[shinai banging]

10:21.655 --> 10:24.022
[five as four whimpering]

something's not right.

10:46.013 --> 10:48.780
Brain-wave activity
is all over the place.

10:48.782 --> 10:49.848
Pull her out.

[five gasping]

10:54.788 --> 11:00.191
[five panting]

11:00.193 --> 11:01.326
What happened?

11:01.328 --> 11:02.994
[two]
we shut it down.

11:02.996 --> 11:05.080
Why?

11:05.081 --> 11:07.165
Because i don't want you to
have a stroke, that's why.

11:07.334 --> 11:11.002
Hey, this was a bad idea.

11:20.080 --> 11:21.312
[four grunting]

11:21.314 --> 11:32.090
[sword whipping]

11:36.363 --> 11:39.030
It was one of your memories--

11:39.833 --> 11:41.299
That's what
i was experiencing

11:41.301 --> 11:44.202
When they pulled
me out, i'm sure of it.

11:44.204 --> 11:47.205
You were younger,
maybe 12 or 13.

11:47.207 --> 11:50.175
You were sparring
with another boy.

11:50.177 --> 11:53.411
You went easy on him,
and your father--

11:54.715 --> 11:57.248
Well, he wasn't very happy.

11:59.920 --> 12:01.086
I see.

12:01.088 --> 12:06.257
Sorry, i wish i could've seen
more, something useful.

12:06.993 --> 12:08.393
You need to learn control.

12:11.131 --> 12:14.132
I don't know how,
the memories they're random.

12:14.134 --> 12:18.303
No, you need to learn
to control yourself.

12:18.305 --> 12:22.874
Look, you're a smart girl,
but you have an undisciplined m.

12:33.220 --> 12:35.353

12:35.355 --> 12:38.523
Yeah, but they're nothing
but recordings of past events.

12:38.525 --> 12:41.326
They can't be changed,

you made this for me?

That time we
went to the beach?

13:47.928 --> 13:52.163

It's funny to think that
i kept it all these years.

This was father's doing.

He wants people to fear me.

He thinks it's

You had to
do it in my name.

26:35.995 --> 26:38.162
Her brain is losing
contact with her body.

26:38.164 --> 26:39.930
And without the brain,
the body dies.

26:39.932 --> 26:41.298
Precisely.

26:41.300 --> 26:43.734
We could put her in stasis,
that would keep her alive.

26:43.736 --> 26:45.302
I don't think
that's a good idea.

26:45.304 --> 26:46.770
She's lost
in the memories.

26:46.772 --> 26:48.606
She's gone
too deep, am i right?

26:48.608 --> 26:50.274
It's possible.

26:50.275 --> 26:51.941
[four] then the longer
she stays in there, the worse i.

26:51.944 --> 26:54.712
We have to get her out now,
or we never will.

26:54.714 --> 26:56.297
How?

26:56.298 --> 26:57.881
Someone has to go
in there and get her.

26:57.883 --> 26:59.049
Is that even possible?

26:59.051 --> 27:00.918
Effectively, yes.

27:00.920 --> 27:02.620
[one and two]
i'll do it.

27:02.622 --> 27:04.021
[six]
no.

27:04.023 --> 27:05.089
I'll go.

27:07.927 --> 27:09.994
And i'm not arguing.

[three] well, well, well
what do we have here?

27:51.070 --> 27:55.039
Looks like a stowaway,
maybe a thief.

27:55.041 --> 27:55.939
A junkie?

27:55.941 --> 27:57.207
I'm not a junkie.

27:57.209 --> 28:00.210
Then why the meds, hmm?

28:00.212 --> 28:02.112
What's the matter, can't talk?

28:04.316 --> 28:05.949
Ah, don't worry about it,

28:05.951 --> 28:07.985
There's no sound
where you're going anyway.

28:09.955 --> 28:11.922
[five] you can't do this!

28:11.923 --> 28:13.890
[three] sure i can, i'm barely
breaking a sweat here.

28:13.893 --> 28:15.192
What about the
rest of your crew?

28:15.194 --> 28:16.827
What about them?

28:16.829 --> 28:18.862
Well maybe they'd object to
throwing a girl out the airlock!

28:18.864 --> 28:20.864
You don't know
the rest of my crew.

28:20.866 --> 28:24.001
[door beeping]

28:24.737 --> 28:27.404
Wait, wait i have something.

28:27.406 --> 28:29.173
Something valuable.

28:29.175 --> 28:30.074
Really?

28:30.076 --> 28:32.610
It's a key.

28:32.611 --> 28:35.145
I-i'm not exactly sure what for,
but the guy i stole it from

28:35.147 --> 28:37.214
Killed all my friends
trying to get it back,

28:37.216 --> 28:39.183
So it must be worth
something, right?

28:39.852 --> 28:41.418
It's hidden
somewhere on this ship.

28:41.420 --> 28:43.220
You'll never find
it without my help.

28:43.222 --> 28:44.288
Hmm.

28:47.126 --> 28:48.425
I can live with that.

28:48.427 --> 28:51.095
Please, no, no.

28:51.097 --> 28:52.863
[five]
no, please, please.

28:55.034 --> 28:58.001
[five pounding on door]
don't do this!

28:59.472 --> 29:02.439
[android] because you'll experie
the memories through her percep,

29:02.441 --> 29:05.476
They won't seem like your own,
the way they do for her.

29:05.478 --> 29:07.811
You'll feel more like
an outside observer.

29:07.813 --> 29:10.380
For that reason, i don't think
there's any chance of you

29:10.382 --> 29:12.783
Losing yourself,
the way she did.

29:12.785 --> 29:14.318
[six]
that's good to know.

29:14.320 --> 29:16.854
Of course,
it's just a theory.

29:18.824 --> 29:19.757
Thanks.

29:21.093 --> 29:22.960
How will he find her?

29:22.962 --> 29:25.496
She's got a lifetime of memories
crammed inside that head.

29:25.498 --> 29:27.331
That's a lot
of ground to cover.

29:27.333 --> 29:30.334
I can do my best to sync
your brain pattern to hers.

29:30.336 --> 29:32.002
That should get you close.

29:32.004 --> 29:34.304
But you'll still have to
will yourself in and out

29:34.306 --> 29:37.941
Of each memory you
encounter until you find her.

29:37.943 --> 29:39.777
Sounds like
a piece of cake.

29:39.779 --> 29:41.044
[two]
you can do this.

29:41.046 --> 29:43.080
You'll find her,
and you'll bring her back.

29:43.082 --> 29:44.047
I know it.

29:45.518 --> 29:46.517
Okay.

29:47.253 --> 29:48.919
Fire it up.

we got away with it.

i call trading up!

30:33.599 --> 30:36.567
No one's ever stolen

30:36.569 --> 30:38.502
This is gonna
change everything.

30:38.504 --> 30:40.270

But he had to return
to arrakis sadr

30:56.322 --> 30:58.255
To coordinate
our next campaign.

31:13.172 --> 31:14.688
Are you kidding?

31:14.689 --> 31:16.205
G.A.'s won't let this get
out, it's too embarrassing.

31:16.208 --> 31:18.208
Any news station that
tries to broadcast this,

31:18.210 --> 31:20.978
They'll get shut down before
they can even finish the report.

31:20.980 --> 31:23.580

no, this is way too big.

31:23.582 --> 31:26.917
There's no way they
can keep this quiet.

31:26.919 --> 31:30.320

about this, and you know what?

31:30.322 --> 31:32.456
They're gonna be inspired.

They're gonna to realize

31:33.626 --> 31:35.593
The galactic authority
isn't invincible.

31:35.594 --> 31:37.561
They're going to open
their eyes to the corruption

31:37.563 --> 31:41.498

and they're going to start figh.

as ten thousand people

We didn't attack that station,
there was no bomb.

away, that was the mission!

The mission was
to make a statement.

33:06.719 --> 33:10.053

and that's exactly what we did.

33:10.055 --> 33:12.055
The general would
never have agreed to this.

Who do you think came up with
the plan in the first place?

33:16.128 --> 33:21.231
We just... Murdered
ten thousand innocent civilians.

33:21.734 --> 33:24.067

themselves and their families

lame in her left foreleg.

Okay well, your father
will be home tomorrow

35:08.140 --> 35:10.140
And he can
take a look at it.

35:10.142 --> 35:12.109
And it's his
birthday coming up,

35:12.111 --> 35:14.811
So should we make
him something special?

35:14.813 --> 35:16.346
Elderberry pie?

35:17.116 --> 35:20.584
I thought elderberry pie
was your favorite, not his.

35:20.586 --> 35:22.853
Are you sure about that?

35:22.855 --> 35:25.522
Okay, elderberry pie it is.

35:25.524 --> 35:26.823
Mwah!

35:26.825 --> 35:28.792
I'll see you in the kitchen
when you're done, okay?

35:28.794 --> 35:30.227
Okay.

35:30.229 --> 35:36.700
[birds chirping]

you doing here?

35:39.138 --> 35:40.403
[six]
you can see me?

35:40.772 --> 35:43.707
Of course
i can see you.

35:43.709 --> 35:45.876
And i know you're
not supposed to be here.

35:45.878 --> 35:47.711
Whose memory
is this, anyway?

35:50.249 --> 35:54.451
Well they call me
titch for what that's worth

35:54.453 --> 35:56.820
But i'm pretty
sure it's one's.

35:56.822 --> 35:59.856
I see a boy's face in
the mirror every morning.

35:59.858 --> 36:01.892
It doesn't look
all that much like him

36:01.894 --> 36:04.728
But the only
other possibility is three,

36:04.730 --> 36:08.565
And i kinda doubt he
grew up in a place like this.

36:08.567 --> 36:09.933
Yeah, i know
what you mean.

36:11.837 --> 36:12.836
It's nice.

36:13.772 --> 36:16.406
It's better than nice.

36:16.408 --> 36:20.443
He's got two parents who
love him, they've got a farm,

36:20.445 --> 36:24.714
Animals, food on
the table, it's perfect.

36:25.651 --> 36:27.317
How long have you been here?

36:27.619 --> 36:28.852
I've lost track.

36:30.389 --> 36:34.324
It was summer when
i came, it's winter now.

36:36.728 --> 36:38.929
Every day i go
skating on the pond.

36:39.464 --> 36:43.400
You've been on the table
less than two hours.

36:43.402 --> 36:46.636
Well, i guess time works
a little different here.

36:49.575 --> 36:51.274
You know it's not real, right?

36:54.846 --> 36:56.546
I thought we'd lost you...

36:57.416 --> 37:00.383
...Thought you'd forgotten
these were only memories.

37:03.322 --> 37:04.955
Sometimes i do forget.

37:06.758 --> 37:08.758
You have to
come back with me.

37:08.894 --> 37:11.228
Your body is dying.

37:11.230 --> 37:12.762
Your mind's gone,
and without it--

37:12.764 --> 37:15.332
Just put me
in stasis, i'll be fine.

37:15.334 --> 37:17.500
Why, so you can stay here?

37:17.502 --> 37:19.269
It's not even your memory.

37:19.271 --> 37:24.975
I saw some of my own
memories, no thanks.

37:24.977 --> 37:27.444
Yeah, well, that
much i can understand.

37:28.847 --> 37:30.981
Then let me stay.

37:30.983 --> 37:33.250
Look, i admit,
out there in the real world

37:33.252 --> 37:34.417
We've got our problems.

37:36.855 --> 37:39.823
Maybe that's
an understatement.

37:39.825 --> 37:41.958
But in here
you've got no control,

37:41.960 --> 37:43.860
You're just
along for the ride.

37:43.862 --> 37:45.996
That's exactly
what i like about it.

37:45.998 --> 37:48.898
I don't have to think,
i don't have to worry.

37:48.900 --> 37:51.167
But it can't last.

37:51.168 --> 37:53.435
Because as nice as all this is,
there's a storm cloud coming

37:53.438 --> 37:54.838
And you know it.

37:54.840 --> 37:57.607
Whoever grew up here didn't
wind up on that ship

37:57.609 --> 38:00.844
Without something happening
to them, something bad.

38:02.881 --> 38:06.016
Maybe the dad comes home drunk
one day and murders the mom.

38:06.018 --> 38:08.485
Maybe terrorists show
up and set off a bomb.

38:08.487 --> 38:09.719
Who knows?

38:09.721 --> 38:12.022
But it happened to me,
and it happened to you

38:12.024 --> 38:14.591
And it'll happen to him.

38:18.330 --> 38:22.599
Maybe it all ends badly out
there in the real world too,

38:22.601 --> 38:25.969
But then again, maybe not.

38:25.971 --> 38:27.971
In here we can't
change anything,

38:27.973 --> 38:31.941
Out there, we can at least try.

38:48.960 --> 38:50.327
He's back!

38:51.430 --> 38:53.063
Where is she,
did you find her?

38:55.600 --> 38:57.067
[five gasps]

39:01.373 --> 39:03.440
We thought
we'd lost you there.

39:03.442 --> 39:05.342
How are you feeling?

39:05.344 --> 39:07.010
Okay i guess.

39:07.946 --> 39:09.446
Do you know
where you are?

39:09.448 --> 39:10.747
Back on the ship.

39:13.852 --> 39:16.986
Guess there's
no place like home.

39:23.362 --> 39:35.405
[sword whipping]

39:35.407 --> 39:37.774
I saw some more
of your memories.

39:41.146 --> 39:44.080
I know what happened to you,
i know where you're from.

39:46.084 --> 39:47.751
I already know.

39:48.620 --> 39:49.486
You do?

39:50.589 --> 39:53.690
I found a royal signet ring
among my things.

39:53.692 --> 39:56.826
I did some research.

39:56.828 --> 39:58.762
Turns out, i was a prince.

40:01.566 --> 40:06.436
Heir to the throne of ishida,
until i murdered my own father.

40:06.438 --> 40:08.438
No! No you didn't.

40:08.440 --> 40:09.672
You didn't kill him.

40:10.108 --> 40:11.541
What are you talking about?

40:11.710 --> 40:13.643
I was there, i saw it.

40:15.514 --> 40:19.182
You found his body,
but he was already dead.

40:22.821 --> 40:25.088
It was the empress.

40:25.090 --> 40:29.459
She wanted her own
son to rule, your half brother.

40:29.461 --> 40:30.560
The empress.

40:31.897 --> 40:33.830
I saw some of
what you had to do

40:33.832 --> 40:36.900
To get out of there alive
and it wasn't pretty.

40:37.769 --> 40:40.537
Who knows what you
had to do to survive after that

40:40.539 --> 40:45.008
But the point is,
it wasn't your fault.

40:45.010 --> 40:51.781
And now that you know,
you can put it behind you, righ?

40:51.783 --> 40:54.951
You don't have to be
that person anymore.

40:56.721 --> 40:58.488
Right?

41:15.207 --> 41:16.573
[knocking]

41:17.909 --> 41:19.008
Come in.

41:19.010 --> 41:22.912
I wanted to thank you
for coming to get me.

41:24.749 --> 41:25.915
You're welcome.

41:25.917 --> 41:28.785
You should know one
and two also volunteered.

41:29.888 --> 41:30.787
Not three?

41:30.789 --> 41:33.923
[six chuckles]

41:33.925 --> 41:36.059
You know,
it's one of the reasons

41:36.061 --> 41:38.495
Why i didn't
want to come back.

41:38.497 --> 41:41.231
I never felt like i knew
who to trust out here.

41:41.233 --> 41:46.236
I mean, i thought
i could trust two,

41:46.238 --> 41:48.104
But sometimes she
scares me a little.

41:48.106 --> 41:50.006
Yeah, join the club.

41:52.077 --> 41:54.844
But now, at least,
i know i can trust you.

42:03.955 --> 42:05.154
Goodnight.

42:05.156 --> 42:07.190
Goodnight.

42:15.100 --> 42:16.633
[beeping]

42:16.635 --> 42:20.270
[door slides shut]

42:22.240 --> 42:25.241
[news anchor] this is believed o
be the only known recorded image

42:25.243 --> 42:27.310
Of the mastermind
behind the bombing

42:27.312 --> 42:29.045
Of station hyadum twelve,

42:29.047 --> 42:32.015
Known to his followers
as simply "the general."

42:32.017 --> 42:34.717
Although he's the subject
of an intense manhunt

42:34.719 --> 42:38.187
By the galactic authority,
his current whereabouts remain .
