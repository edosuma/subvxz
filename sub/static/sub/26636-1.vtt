WEBVTT

00:31.156 --> 00:33.523
There you go.

00:33.617 --> 00:35.609
Nurse Kelly, can you bring the gloves?

00:37.829 --> 00:42.915
What you are experiencing
is just a metaphor.

00:43.001 --> 00:46.290
The emotions you are having
are not your own.

00:47.339 --> 00:48.921
They are someone else's.

00:50.676 --> 00:53.384
You are not the cat.

00:53.470 --> 00:56.178
You are <i>inside</i> the cat.

00:57.182 --> 00:59.799
Now lie back.

00:59.893 --> 01:02.055
Oh.

01:34.094 --> 01:35.630
Are you...

01:57.117 --> 01:58.653
Are you okay?

01:58.744 --> 02:02.033
Hey there.

02:02.122 --> 02:03.363
Yes.

02:04.666 --> 02:07.579
Yes, my sweet kitty.

02:07.669 --> 02:08.876
Yes.

02:24.436 --> 02:26.678
Oh!

02:28.398 --> 02:32.142
Oh. Do you want a little scratching, kitty?

02:32.235 --> 02:35.945
Does that feel nice?

02:39.368 --> 02:42.611
Yeah. Yeah.

02:42.704 --> 02:44.696
Oh.

02:44.790 --> 02:47.749
Oh, kitty. Yeah.

Hey! Hey!

04:39.821 --> 04:44.191
Your house is too weak.
You have to keep running to a safer house.

04:58.131 --> 04:59.667
Great.

05:07.307 --> 05:12.348
Just like your birth.
Just birth yourself right out of the cocoon.

06:02.153 --> 06:03.610
Madeline, what are you doing?

06:05.782 --> 06:07.523
I was a sea turtle.

06:09.202 --> 06:12.491
You were a sea turtle, and then you
were a woman playing a sea turtle.

06:12.581 --> 06:15.119
Look at your hands.

06:15.208 --> 06:16.494
Hands.

06:16.585 --> 06:18.292
Whose hands are those?

06:19.546 --> 06:23.085
Are they yours, or are they the turtle's?

06:26.803 --> 06:29.011
Yes, that's it.

06:29.097 --> 06:30.463
You're there! You're there!

06:32.684 --> 06:34.676
You're there. We can all feel it.

06:56.583 --> 06:58.370
Good entrance.

06:58.460 --> 07:00.372
I like that entrance.

07:02.005 --> 07:05.089
Yeah.

07:05.175 --> 07:08.714
We don't really have, like, a professor.

07:13.725 --> 07:15.637
That's great. Feel that beat.

07:21.024 --> 07:24.017
I think you should
come with me right now.

07:24.110 --> 07:26.443
- Okay.
- Come with me, honey.

07:26.529 --> 07:30.648
What is it? You're in my...

07:33.453 --> 07:35.536
Shh!

07:35.622 --> 07:38.080
What is going on?

07:41.044 --> 07:42.785
One, two, three.

07:56.726 --> 07:59.184
Duck down! Duck down! Drive! Drive!

07:59.270 --> 08:01.512
- Okay.
- Duck, duck, duck! Duck down! Duck!

08:01.606 --> 08:03.814
Drive! Drive, drive!

08:03.900 --> 08:05.892
- Oh, shit. Oh, shit.
- Go, Mom!

08:05.986 --> 08:07.352
I'm going, I'm going.

08:07.445 --> 08:09.125
I can't duck and drive.

08:09.197 --> 08:10.904
Just go! Just go!

08:10.991 --> 08:13.483
I'm going! Are you okay?

08:13.576 --> 08:14.817
Yes!

08:14.911 --> 08:18.621
Oh, my God.
We just mooned Evangeline.

08:20.792 --> 08:22.658
- You did?
- Yes.

08:27.632 --> 08:29.248
Let's go!

08:32.303 --> 08:36.388
I thought you...
I thought something had happened.

08:40.812 --> 08:42.519
Are you really okay?

08:44.858 --> 08:49.228
- Mom. What... Why... We-We-We just ran away.
- Were they mean to you, or...?

08:49.320 --> 08:52.188
No, no. They're really fun. They're nice.

08:52.282 --> 08:56.151
- But they're always, like, making fun of you, or...
- No, that's at school.

08:58.538 --> 09:00.530
Can we go now?

09:09.215 --> 09:11.832
But you were running from them.

09:54.719 --> 09:57.382
Great. Great paws.

09:57.472 --> 10:00.385
It's so... It's so...

10:00.475 --> 10:02.387
The cat has its own personality.

10:02.477 --> 10:04.389
I mean, when you invest like you did,

10:04.479 --> 10:08.098
it's not just an idea of a cat,
it's... great.

10:08.191 --> 10:09.432
Okay, moving on.

10:13.279 --> 10:15.236
Uh, Jamal is a friend of mine,

10:15.323 --> 10:17.781
and he's come and offered
to share specifically

10:17.867 --> 10:20.735
some of his experience,
uh, being incarcerated.

10:20.829 --> 10:24.163
And thank you so much for coming.

10:24.249 --> 10:26.161
Well, thank you for having me here.

10:26.251 --> 10:28.208
We really appreciate it.

10:28.294 --> 10:30.832
Um, how do you... How does it...

10:30.922 --> 10:33.835
Do you want to just talk, or do you
want us to ask you some questions?

10:33.925 --> 10:36.633
- What's good for you?
- Uh, whatever works for you guys.

10:36.719 --> 10:38.631
Just go around, ask a few questions.

10:38.721 --> 10:41.304
Did you get out
because your sentence was over?

10:41.391 --> 10:43.007
Did you get out early?

10:43.101 --> 10:45.093
You know, how long have you been out?

10:45.186 --> 10:49.430
I spent two years and three months

10:49.524 --> 10:51.516
in a cell by myself.

10:51.609 --> 10:54.443
Your brain... Your mind is always working.

10:54.529 --> 10:56.486
And it's like, you know,

10:56.573 --> 10:59.407
you have to stimulate it to keep it going.

10:59.492 --> 11:02.451
I would read the back of my toothpaste.

11:02.537 --> 11:07.532
Like, the fluoride and, you know,
like, chloride or whatever.

11:07.625 --> 11:09.207
Whatever the percentage.

11:09.294 --> 11:14.380
If you could change one thing
about the past, what would it be?

11:16.050 --> 11:17.336
Um...

11:20.013 --> 11:22.756
my association with people.

11:22.849 --> 11:26.217
Does anyone else have an experience
or a moment of violence

11:26.311 --> 11:29.304
that's happened to them
that they might want to share?

11:33.401 --> 11:37.771
...to give you a hug. Would you mind?

11:37.864 --> 11:39.981
You're so tall!

11:40.074 --> 11:41.736
Come down here.

11:54.964 --> 11:56.956
Okay, let's do, um...

11:57.050 --> 12:00.714
Let's do an improv based
on the theme of "no way out."

12:00.803 --> 12:04.046
<i>- Okay, we're basing this on Jamal's stories, right?
- Yes.</i>

12:04.140 --> 12:07.429
<i>- His prison experiences, right?
- An open canvas on the theme ofno way out.</i>

12:07.518 --> 12:11.478
In a simple,
single gesture, crossing the stage.

12:14.567 --> 12:16.980
You want to jump in, Madeline?

12:39.801 --> 12:42.714
Are we gonna... Are we gonna
use his story? Is it Jamal's?

12:42.804 --> 12:45.717
Is Jamal gonna be the character?
Is he one of the pigs?

12:45.807 --> 12:48.345
Why is prison relevant to this?

12:48.434 --> 12:51.302
Hey, Evangeline, can we ask you something?

12:51.396 --> 12:56.516
Is this a metaphor?
Are we using prison as a metaphor?

12:56.609 --> 12:59.397
So what are we making?

13:14.877 --> 13:17.290
<i>This is just a metaphor.</i>

13:18.464 --> 13:19.796
But, so...

13:19.882 --> 13:24.217
I mean, I just really wanted
to stay after rehearsal.

13:24.304 --> 13:28.719
- I'm just bummed I'm not staying after rehearsal.
- Well, do you want to walk home?

13:28.808 --> 13:31.050
No. I wanted to tell Evangeline something.

13:31.144 --> 13:33.122
And we're always late
so I never get to talk to her.

13:33.146 --> 13:35.559
- It's a five-mile walk back.
- No, I...

13:35.648 --> 13:38.436
- Shit. Fuck it.
- What?

13:38.526 --> 13:42.019
- Go to rehearsal, go to rehearsal, go to rehearsal.
- What?

13:43.031 --> 13:44.238
Okay.

13:46.367 --> 13:48.233
What? What?

13:48.328 --> 13:51.537
- You just... You wanna... You wanna go? Okay.
- Mom...

13:51.622 --> 13:54.035
- I thought we were ordering takeout.
- Mom!

13:54.125 --> 13:56.287
I said we can go home.

13:56.377 --> 13:59.336
You wanna go, so go. Get out!

13:59.422 --> 14:01.334
- No! Mom, we can go home.
- Get out!

14:01.424 --> 14:04.508
- Out, out, out, out! I will be waiting here!
- No. No. No.

14:04.594 --> 14:05.755
We can go home.

14:13.686 --> 14:17.771
Mom, what would you be
if you were someone else?

14:17.857 --> 14:21.066
Do you mean, like, a famous person?

14:21.152 --> 14:23.644
No, he means, um,

14:23.738 --> 14:28.699
if you could cut out someone's face
and wear it as your own,

14:28.785 --> 14:30.367
who would it be?

14:32.580 --> 14:34.993
- You been smoking?
- No.

14:35.083 --> 14:36.870
Oh. Oh.

14:36.959 --> 14:39.417
- You mean...
- What's your answer?

14:41.130 --> 14:42.871
Spring rolls.

14:42.965 --> 14:46.504
- The sky.
- Sky, as in the YouTuber?

14:46.594 --> 14:48.836
The motherfucking sky.

14:48.930 --> 14:50.592
- Okay. Yeah.
- The sky.

14:50.681 --> 14:52.673
You don't have to use that word.

14:52.767 --> 14:54.850
- Yeah, Madge.
- W-Well...

14:54.936 --> 14:56.768
Don't call me Madge.

14:56.854 --> 14:58.140
Okay, Madge.

14:59.982 --> 15:05.148
You know what? Call me Madge one more time,
and I'll cut your face out and wear it.

15:06.197 --> 15:07.859
Well, I would be Chris Paul.

15:07.949 --> 15:10.344
- You're not gonna eat anything?
- You'd be cutting off Chris Paul's face.

15:10.368 --> 15:12.610
Do you want some peanut butter toast?

15:12.703 --> 15:15.161
Yeah, do you want some toast?

15:15.248 --> 15:18.616
Put some little peanut butter, Madge?

15:18.709 --> 15:20.746
Asshole.

15:20.837 --> 15:22.749
- I'm gonna cut your face out.
- No, you're not.

15:22.839 --> 15:25.297
- Yes, I am.
- No scissors.

15:25.383 --> 15:28.467
- This is my face.
- You can have my face!

15:28.553 --> 15:31.216
<i>I mean, I don't...</i>

15:31.305 --> 15:34.969
<i>Ijust wish that I knew she was safe.
You know?</i>

15:35.852 --> 15:37.514
<i>Or that</i> I <i>was safe.</i>

15:37.603 --> 15:41.722
<i>She threw an ashtray at her brother's forehead.
He had to get stitches.</i>

16:06.632 --> 16:10.091
If we move away from the prison concept
we need more rehearsal time.

16:10.178 --> 16:12.841
We can't afford this space here anymore.

16:12.930 --> 16:15.092
- So, it's a...
- Hey.

16:15.183 --> 16:16.799
- No, I...
- Um, can I...

16:16.893 --> 16:20.386
- Can I talk to you about something?
- Sure.

16:20.480 --> 16:21.812
Sure.

16:47.006 --> 16:50.750
I had this dream that I wanted
to tell you about, but, you know...

16:50.843 --> 16:52.425
I know.

16:56.807 --> 16:58.639
You know what they say about dreaming.

16:58.726 --> 17:00.718
You just have to trust yourself.

17:02.480 --> 17:08.897
Jung says that...
in all chaos there is a cosmos,

17:08.986 --> 17:12.023
in all disorder a secret order,

17:12.114 --> 17:14.948
that the pendulum of the mind

17:15.034 --> 17:17.320
swings between sense and nonsense,

17:17.411 --> 17:19.824
not between right and wrong.

17:19.914 --> 17:21.496
Dreams are awesome.

17:28.798 --> 17:31.962
I dreamt I slammed my mother's hand
with an iron.

17:34.929 --> 17:36.136
I couldn't breathe.

17:40.935 --> 17:43.928
It felt like I was underwater, watching her.

17:49.902 --> 17:52.895
Anything like that,
you can always share it with me.

17:57.535 --> 17:59.652
I dreamt you were my daughter.

18:08.296 --> 18:11.164
Do you feel safe around your mom?

18:15.052 --> 18:18.170
Ladies, let's go. Let's get in here.
Gotta celebrate.

18:32.528 --> 18:34.315
- Harsh.
- Shut up.

18:34.405 --> 18:36.567
I just have to watch out for the, um...

18:36.657 --> 18:38.649
- For the cracks?
- Yeah. The, um...

18:38.743 --> 18:41.486
All right. I mean... Stop. We could race.

18:43.831 --> 18:45.743
Life has a lot of pain in it.

18:45.833 --> 18:47.415
No, I'm serious.

18:47.501 --> 18:49.743
- Uh-huh.
- But, um...

18:49.837 --> 18:52.079
Like, Socrates said that or something?

18:52.173 --> 18:53.789
- No.
- Uh-huh.

18:53.883 --> 18:56.421
Socrates didn't say it. Aristotle did.

19:05.394 --> 19:07.351
You're kind of making a new dance up.

19:07.438 --> 19:09.555
It's called, like,
the roller blade stutter step.

19:14.111 --> 19:17.730
Oh, man.

19:25.206 --> 19:26.913
You're really quiet.

19:26.999 --> 19:28.661
Oh.

19:28.751 --> 19:29.662
No.

19:29.752 --> 19:30.868
- No?
- No!

19:30.961 --> 19:33.874
You're like,
my hair's just blowing in the wind.

19:50.398 --> 19:52.014
Oh, sh...

19:52.108 --> 19:53.644
Where are you going?

19:54.944 --> 19:56.901
- Good night!
- You're going home?

19:58.280 --> 20:01.193
I mean, can I get a kiss without the hair in it?

20:44.493 --> 20:46.405
She is lovely.

20:46.495 --> 20:49.408
How far is she gonna go up
your ass though? You know what I mean?

20:59.759 --> 21:02.718
No, that's Adrianna. Chill.

21:02.803 --> 21:04.089
Adrianna, what's up?

21:06.265 --> 21:09.554
- Going to the park?
- Yeah. You going to the park?

21:09.643 --> 21:11.680
Hey, Madeline. What's up?

21:11.771 --> 21:14.514
What's in your basement?

21:14.607 --> 21:17.771
Yo, me and the guys over there,
we took bets,

21:17.860 --> 21:20.773
and we think there's
five dead bodies in there.

21:20.863 --> 21:23.230
Five, for every finger on your hand.

21:28.287 --> 21:31.780
I killed 'em with my fingernails!

21:38.380 --> 21:40.417
You're weird.

21:40.508 --> 21:42.861
I feel like this is the start
of an M. Night Shyamalan movie.

21:44.512 --> 21:46.754
Okay, what do you guys think?

21:46.847 --> 21:48.759
Yo, check out the titties everywhere.

21:48.849 --> 21:53.310
- Oh, God. Henry. Henry.
- Your dad likes white women.

21:53.395 --> 21:55.307
- Yeah, he does.
- He sure does, dude.

21:55.397 --> 21:57.184
My mom's white, so...

21:57.274 --> 21:59.106
Ooh! Jungle fever.

21:59.193 --> 22:00.684
- What?
- Check it out.

22:00.778 --> 22:02.986
MILFs.

22:03.072 --> 22:05.314
- You guys want to watch it?
- No.

22:05.407 --> 22:07.569
- Why? You've seen it before?
- Yep.

22:07.660 --> 22:10.573
What, are you guys,
like, porn freaks or something?

22:10.663 --> 22:13.531
I wouldn't say "porn freaks."
More like porn scholars.

22:13.624 --> 22:14.910
- Right?
- Yeah.

22:15.000 --> 22:17.993
Okay, Henry, move.
I'm gonna find something.

22:19.171 --> 22:23.085
How about <i>Dr. French and the Llama?</i>

22:23.175 --> 22:25.838
Oh. Dr. French?

22:25.928 --> 22:30.639
<i>Do you want me
to hold her down, Dr. French?</i>

22:30.724 --> 22:33.637
- You like this, Madeline?
- Not really.

22:33.727 --> 22:36.720
Oh, she's eating her ass.

22:39.024 --> 22:42.813
<i>I think I'm gonna need
some help here, Dr. English.</i>

22:42.903 --> 22:46.021
Your dad sure is into that good stuff.

22:47.449 --> 22:49.907
<i>Bring me the whip.</i>

22:49.994 --> 22:52.202
<i>Show me where it hurts.</i>

22:52.288 --> 22:54.391
- You come down here and make out?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

22:54.415 --> 22:56.655
- I've never been in here a day in my life.
- No!

22:57.793 --> 22:59.705
Oh, God.

22:59.795 --> 23:02.583
If you keep saying that,
I'm gonna have to throw you out.

23:02.673 --> 23:04.915
You got <i>Steamboat Willie?</i>

23:05.009 --> 23:06.921
Yeah. What's... Oh.

23:07.011 --> 23:08.798
- Oh. Hey.
<i>- Don't hurt me.</i>

23:08.888 --> 23:10.675
<i>Ouch. Ouch.</i>

23:10.764 --> 23:13.427
- Madeline?
<i>- Ouch! Ouch!</i>

23:13.517 --> 23:15.930
Oh, shit. Oh, fuck.

23:16.020 --> 23:17.352
Fuck.

23:25.946 --> 23:29.360
<i>Is that right?</i>

23:29.450 --> 23:33.069
<i>Okay! Ah! Yeah.</i>

23:33.162 --> 23:36.030
I was just showing them the basement.

23:40.920 --> 23:42.502
Mm-hmm.

23:43.923 --> 23:47.792
Why don't you sit down. Let's watch this!

23:47.885 --> 23:51.378
Okay. Right? Sit down, Madeline.
This what you were doing?

23:51.472 --> 23:53.680
- This what I interrupted?
- We were just...

23:53.766 --> 23:56.679
Yeah? Well, just do it.
Go ahead. Do it. Whip it out.

23:56.769 --> 23:59.261
<i>You're putting it in her asshole!</i>

23:59.355 --> 24:03.395
This is a good idea? You want her
in a psych ward for another six weeks?

24:03.484 --> 24:05.020
With her condition?

24:05.110 --> 24:07.978
- Are you crazy or something?
- No. I'm not. I'm not.

24:08.072 --> 24:09.984
Mom. Mom!

24:10.074 --> 24:12.657
<i>We're not in your office.</i>

24:12.743 --> 24:15.281
<i>It's just a metaphor.</i>

24:17.122 --> 24:19.455
Get out! Get out!

24:24.672 --> 24:26.664
Madeline the slut.

24:28.801 --> 24:32.420
The slut Madeline arranges
a special treat for me.

24:33.305 --> 24:35.592
That is...

24:35.683 --> 24:38.767
Okay. All right. Okay. We're done.

24:38.852 --> 24:40.388
Done. Done.

24:46.276 --> 24:49.064
No. No. No!

24:52.032 --> 24:55.901
<i>- Would you like some help with that?
- Uh-huh.</i>

25:08.465 --> 25:10.673
<i>Lay down. Lay down!</i>

25:10.759 --> 25:13.376
<i>Put your head down!</i>

25:14.805 --> 25:16.216
<i>Lie back.</i>

25:17.558 --> 25:19.265
<i>Lie back!</i>

25:36.744 --> 25:39.236
- Hey.
- Hi.

26:19.411 --> 26:21.653
Surprise!

26:21.747 --> 26:25.286
We thought you were Evangeline! She's pregnant!

26:25.375 --> 26:26.616
She's pregnant.

26:26.710 --> 26:29.703
We're so excited!

26:31.256 --> 26:33.168
Oh, cool. Um...

26:33.258 --> 26:35.698
- Well, I want to say congratulations too.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

26:38.055 --> 26:40.342
- Okay.
- Shh-shh-shh.

26:40.432 --> 26:41.548
Hello!

26:41.642 --> 26:43.554
- Okay.
- Where is everybody?

26:43.644 --> 26:45.727
What the hell? Max?

26:45.813 --> 26:49.227
Surprise!

26:49.316 --> 26:51.308
- Congratulations!
- Congratulations!

26:51.401 --> 26:54.314
- For what?
- For being pregnant!

26:54.404 --> 26:56.316
Yeah, I told...

26:58.951 --> 27:02.069
- For the next generation!
- Oh!

27:02.162 --> 27:04.654
Just for today, we're gonna...

27:04.748 --> 27:08.241
Madeline and Santos are gonna be doing
that workshopping, so let's...

27:08.335 --> 27:10.247
Okay, let's party for a little bit.

27:10.337 --> 27:14.297
Hi! Thank you!

27:20.931 --> 27:23.514
- Take a piece.
- Why you picking at your hands?

27:23.600 --> 27:25.341
Wh-What?

27:25.435 --> 27:28.098
Why are you so jittery? Relax.

27:28.188 --> 27:30.180
I'm not. Why are you looking at my hands?

27:30.274 --> 27:32.482
- This is for you.
- Oh.

27:38.282 --> 27:40.194
- Madeline?
- Hey.

27:40.284 --> 27:41.741
- You okay?
- Hey, you know...

27:41.827 --> 27:43.068
Come talk to me.

27:44.496 --> 27:48.536
I've been thinking about how fun
it's been to work with you.

27:48.625 --> 27:50.105
- The group's been struggling.
- Yeah.

27:50.169 --> 27:52.081
And you get my work like no one else.

27:52.171 --> 27:55.585
This process is so intimate,
and I'm really glad you're here.

27:57.176 --> 27:58.383
Me too.

27:59.887 --> 28:02.379
So I-I was thinking that, um...

28:03.432 --> 28:05.344
I want to deepen the work

28:05.434 --> 28:08.893
that we're doing with the character
that you're gonna play.

28:08.979 --> 28:10.720
Do you want to name her?

28:10.814 --> 28:13.352
Oh, I... I thought of a name.

28:13.442 --> 28:15.775
- What?
- Zia.

28:15.861 --> 28:17.477
- Zia?
- Yeah.

28:18.906 --> 28:21.899
That is... It's really powerful.

28:23.744 --> 28:26.452
You know, one of the ways
that we could maybe...

28:28.290 --> 28:32.079
sort of make Zia more concrete would be...

28:32.169 --> 28:35.537
I was thinking we could explore the dream
that you were telling me about

28:35.631 --> 28:37.167
and maybe act it out.

28:37.257 --> 28:39.169
- Dream?
- The one that you...

28:39.259 --> 28:41.546
With the iron,
and you slam your mom's hand.

28:41.637 --> 28:44.755
It's so just potent.

28:44.848 --> 28:49.013
And I-I can't stop thinking about those images.

28:49.102 --> 28:52.436
You know, dream work can be this really...

28:52.522 --> 28:55.185
<i>Uh, anyway...</i>

28:55.275 --> 28:58.109
we should...

28:58.195 --> 28:59.652
try acting it out.

28:59.738 --> 29:03.197
How do you feel about that?

29:06.036 --> 29:07.447
I, uh...

29:08.455 --> 29:11.072
- I guess, yeah.
- Okay.

29:11.166 --> 29:14.034
How did it go again?

29:18.590 --> 29:21.503
<i>The day started out, we were in the car.</i>

29:21.593 --> 29:24.131
<i>She thought my friends hated me.</i>

29:24.221 --> 29:27.134
- Are they bullying you?
<i>- She thought my friends were being mean to me.</i>

29:27.224 --> 29:29.011
Are they being mean to you?

29:29.101 --> 29:32.390
Be silent. Great.
You're hurting your mother. That's fine.

29:32.479 --> 29:35.062
One day you'll live to regret it.

29:37.734 --> 29:40.852
Well, look at me.
You're looking at me like I'm crazy.

29:40.946 --> 29:43.154
Go play with your kittens.

29:49.079 --> 29:51.599
At the beginning, between the mother. Yeah.

29:51.623 --> 29:53.205
Great. Thank you.

29:55.544 --> 29:56.955
Thank you.

29:57.045 --> 29:59.708
Madeline, was that...
Is that about how it felt?

29:59.798 --> 30:01.630
What?

30:01.717 --> 30:03.879
I think we need to, um,

30:03.969 --> 30:06.211
emphasize the fractured, um,

30:08.181 --> 30:10.410
disjointed relationship with the mother
at the beginning.

30:10.434 --> 30:12.141
- Okay. At the beginning.
- Mm-hmm.

30:15.522 --> 30:17.104
Hey. Come here.

30:17.190 --> 30:18.397
Yeah. Come here.

30:18.483 --> 30:21.066
Try it.

30:21.153 --> 30:23.395
Just really look at its face.

30:23.488 --> 30:27.198
Look at its face. Really look.
'Cause you're gonna become that.

30:40.547 --> 30:41.879
Can you see?

30:57.898 --> 31:00.936
Try to focus. That's right.

31:02.069 --> 31:04.527
Good. Great.

31:10.327 --> 31:12.319
Madeline! Stay in the center.

31:15.582 --> 31:19.952
Madeline, where are you go...
You're in the middle for this!

31:51.326 --> 31:52.737
Madeline.

31:54.538 --> 31:56.279
Are you done, or should...?

31:59.584 --> 32:00.950
Is she done, or...?

32:45.005 --> 32:46.246
Hello!

33:01.897 --> 33:04.605
CK is one block south.

33:23.418 --> 33:25.660
Have you seen my daughter?

33:25.754 --> 33:27.746
No. I'm sorry, no.

33:30.383 --> 33:33.376
Oodles of noodles. Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

33:33.470 --> 33:36.429
Oh, brah, brah, brah.

33:36.515 --> 33:38.928
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

33:39.017 --> 33:41.930
Yeah, yeah, yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah, yeah!

33:42.020 --> 33:45.855
Yeah. Yeah. Let me get some noodles.
Let me get some noodles.

33:45.941 --> 33:48.479
Go, go! Go, go! Go, go!

33:48.568 --> 33:53.108
Go, go! Go, go!

33:53.198 --> 33:54.780
Oh! Oh!

33:54.866 --> 33:56.903
Hi. How are you? How are you?

33:56.993 --> 33:58.985
I could really, really like that.

34:00.413 --> 34:03.372
Hi. How are you? How are you?

34:08.964 --> 34:10.795
G-Go, go! Go, go!

34:20.100 --> 34:24.719
Go, go! Go, go!

34:41.371 --> 34:43.328
<i>Yes, it's an emergency.</i>

34:43.415 --> 34:46.453
<i>Her prescription ran out a week ago.</i>

34:46.543 --> 34:48.830
<i>Mm-hmm. Y... Because she didn't tell me.</i>

34:48.920 --> 34:51.206
I'm sorry. She's a teenager, so...

34:51.297 --> 34:54.291
She just doesn't tell me
everything in her life.

34:57.762 --> 35:00.926
Honey. Honey, I have food.

35:01.766 --> 35:03.758
And a little present for you.

35:10.191 --> 35:12.433
Okay, well, here it is.

35:12.527 --> 35:14.894
I'm leaving it here.

35:14.988 --> 35:17.856
Okay? There's...

35:17.949 --> 35:20.942
Maddie, maybe no rehearsal
for a while. Right? 'Cause...

35:27.459 --> 35:30.452
All right. Get it, or the cat'll get it.

35:49.356 --> 35:52.724
You're gonna want to be on varsity.

35:52.817 --> 35:55.730
But you don't have to, you know.

35:55.820 --> 35:59.188
JV is for the younger guys too. You know?

35:59.282 --> 36:01.865
It's not, like, an embarrassing thing.

36:01.951 --> 36:05.115
That's what it's there for. Come on, honey.

36:15.548 --> 36:18.040
- And that lady over there?
- Yes.

36:18.134 --> 36:20.922
- She's got cobwebs in her vagina.
- Oh!

36:21.012 --> 36:23.880
Never say that about an older woman,
because that'll be you.

36:26.017 --> 36:27.428
It will be. It will be.

36:27.519 --> 36:29.886
It already is!

36:29.979 --> 36:31.311
- Okay, look at...
- Oh!

36:31.398 --> 36:34.687
See the middle one?
Do you know what I'm gonna say?

36:34.776 --> 36:37.143
Yeah... Well, no. She's a lesbian.

36:37.237 --> 36:38.978
Well, she's actually not.

36:39.072 --> 36:43.817
I've seen her with a different man
in this park, like, just walking.

36:43.910 --> 36:46.527
Not doing anything, but a different man,

36:46.621 --> 36:50.831
like, maybe six or seven times.

36:50.917 --> 36:53.409
Just saying. Seriously.

36:53.503 --> 36:55.415
Oh, she gets with it?

36:55.505 --> 36:58.213
Yeah. I don't know what that is.
I mean, you really...

36:58.299 --> 37:00.291
Let's look at her. Look at her.

37:01.344 --> 37:03.301
- Hey!
- Oh, my God.

37:03.388 --> 37:06.005
Oh, God. Don't. Don't.

37:06.099 --> 37:08.216
Really sorry. Did I hurt you, hon?

37:19.612 --> 37:21.649
<i>Mom?</i>

37:21.740 --> 37:24.608
<i>Oh, God. I-I kissed thatguy.</i>

37:24.701 --> 37:26.567
Gosh.

37:26.661 --> 37:29.028
Uh, maybe we should have...

37:29.122 --> 37:31.489
Maybe we shouldn't have,
like, rushed into something

37:31.583 --> 37:34.166
where there was quite
so much responsibility.

37:34.252 --> 37:37.211
He could have herpes. He probably does.

37:37.297 --> 37:39.664
He knows a lot about porn.

37:39.758 --> 37:41.169
And that's a sign.

37:41.259 --> 37:43.876
All just, like, around your mouth,
little pustules.

37:43.970 --> 37:47.008
Stop using that hand stuff.
That just dries your skin out.

37:47.098 --> 37:49.458
- That only makes the whole thing worse.
- I have allergies.

37:49.517 --> 37:52.180
No, you don't have allergies.
You have hypochondria.

37:52.270 --> 37:54.262
Are you looking at Tinder?
Is that what that is?

37:54.355 --> 37:56.517
Have you been snooping on my phone?

37:56.608 --> 37:59.225
- I-I-I...
- Never trust anybody. Okay?

37:59.319 --> 38:02.483
- Can I get out now?
- No, wait, I...

38:02.572 --> 38:06.566
Make sure to choose the right... Okay. Excuse me.

38:06.659 --> 38:09.493
Hi. Yeah. Okay. All right.

38:09.579 --> 38:11.571
Jesus. Have a good day! Good-bye!

38:11.664 --> 38:14.907
He's just doing his job,
you know, and you just...

38:15.001 --> 38:16.958
You want to use protection.

38:17.045 --> 38:18.365
You want to be tested beforehand.

38:18.421 --> 38:20.504
Why would I get tested before?

38:20.590 --> 38:23.628
Okay, right. After. Um... and...

38:23.718 --> 38:26.461
Oh, honey, wait, wait, wait.

38:26.554 --> 38:28.386
Uh...

38:28.473 --> 38:30.840
You know, I just... I want...

38:30.934 --> 38:33.176
I want you to be careful. You know?

38:33.269 --> 38:35.386
Because... you're not...

38:35.480 --> 38:37.722
- I'm not what?
- Um...

38:37.816 --> 38:39.978
You know. You're not like the other people.

38:40.068 --> 38:43.277
- Because I'm black?
- No. Madeline.

38:43.363 --> 38:45.104
Regina.

38:45.198 --> 38:48.817
I just feel like you're maybe not ready,
you know.

38:48.910 --> 38:51.347
- Your situation, which is different...
- What are you saying?

38:51.371 --> 38:53.488
It's different from the other people in the...

38:53.581 --> 38:57.074
Everyone else is... is stable, and, um...

38:57.168 --> 38:59.455
You know, if you had an episode,

38:59.546 --> 39:01.082
which you probably will,

39:01.172 --> 39:02.504
what would happen?

39:02.590 --> 39:04.252
What, Evangeline is gonna...

39:05.176 --> 39:06.838
- Fuck!
- You suck!

39:54.601 --> 39:56.217
Just stop it.

39:58.062 --> 39:59.644
- Hi.
- Hi!

39:59.731 --> 40:01.267
You're here! Hi!

40:01.357 --> 40:04.020
- Sorry we're late.
- No, no, it's good. It's good.

40:04.110 --> 40:06.102
No, you're here. Come on. Let's go.

40:06.195 --> 40:09.279
- How are you?
- She's so glad to have worked with you.

40:09.365 --> 40:11.948
Oh, we love her so much.
We're so glad she's here.

40:12.035 --> 40:14.948
Can you get in your wardrobe right away?
'Cause KK's only got 30 minutes.

40:15.038 --> 40:17.030
Yeah, I have another set to be on.

40:17.123 --> 40:19.035
Another set with Robert De Niro.

40:19.125 --> 40:21.162
Madeline.

40:21.252 --> 40:23.460
Are you all right, Mad?

40:23.546 --> 40:24.627
Because if we did...

40:24.714 --> 40:26.626
You could use your fingernails on my back.

40:26.716 --> 40:28.628
That might be real, real good.

40:28.718 --> 40:30.550
It's like a nail file.

40:30.637 --> 40:34.722
KK, you could come too, baby. I could maybe
get in there and squeeze your ass cheeks.

40:34.807 --> 40:37.720
You ready for that?

40:37.810 --> 40:40.223
Mom, you can come too, if you want to.

40:40.313 --> 40:43.226
Let's start getting it together over here.

40:43.316 --> 40:45.057
We'll put the... Hey. Hey.

40:45.151 --> 40:47.063
I was thinking about investing
in a water bed.

40:47.153 --> 40:49.110
I heard it really makes the rock.

40:49.197 --> 40:51.484
KK, you look so great!

40:51.574 --> 40:53.486
Everyone's gonna love these posters.

40:59.290 --> 41:02.579
She...
As soon as she's done, get her over here.

41:02.669 --> 41:06.037
That's, um, long-haired.
Yeah. We can't... Can you...

41:06.130 --> 41:08.543
Come on, sweetheart.

41:08.633 --> 41:10.090
Geez!

41:10.176 --> 41:13.169
Madeline, can you just, uh, please
come over here with the animal?

41:13.262 --> 41:15.879
- I want to...
- Yeah. Come on. We gotta get going here.

41:15.974 --> 41:18.591
- Thank you.
- Okay. Great.

41:18.685 --> 41:21.223
Just step right up here on this mark, honey.

41:21.312 --> 41:23.349
That's the best pig head ever.

41:23.439 --> 41:26.853
Good. Okay, you guys look amazing.

41:26.943 --> 41:29.230
Wow. Wow, wow, wow.

41:30.238 --> 41:33.572
- Uh...
- Oh, Mommy. Bad news.

41:34.826 --> 41:36.408
Um, do you know what?

41:36.494 --> 41:39.111
It might be great if you could
just step out just for a minute.

41:39.205 --> 41:41.868
'Cause I think it will just allow her
to relax a little bit.

41:41.958 --> 41:42.958
Okay.

41:43.042 --> 41:45.375
I mean, I know it's, like,
sometimes a thing with parents.

41:45.461 --> 41:47.578
This is her snack.

41:47.672 --> 41:50.881
She probably won't take it,
but give it a try.

41:50.967 --> 41:53.175
- Okay, thank you. Thank you.
- Yeah.

41:54.470 --> 41:57.133
Uh, do you want this coconut thing?

41:58.307 --> 42:01.175
Okay. Great. Um...

42:01.269 --> 42:03.386
Thank you.

42:05.773 --> 42:07.981
Oh, my God.

42:08.067 --> 42:09.854
Okay.

42:09.944 --> 42:11.731
Okay. Hey.

42:11.821 --> 42:13.357
- Hi.
- Hi.

42:13.448 --> 42:16.288
My God. I feel like I haven't even got
to talk to you yet. Are you okay?

42:16.367 --> 42:18.095
- I'm good.
- Yeah? How's things with your mom?

42:18.119 --> 42:21.533
On the way here,
she tried to give me the sex talk.

42:21.622 --> 42:23.784
I'm 16. I know everything.

42:23.875 --> 42:26.242
Are you kidding? Oh, my God. That is so...

42:26.335 --> 42:29.314
She just got the sex talk in the car.
That's so weird, because we were just...

42:29.338 --> 42:30.704
That's crazy.

42:30.798 --> 42:32.860
Hunter, you don't get to be
a part of this conversation.

42:32.884 --> 42:36.002
That's so weird, because Laura was
just telling us, and then we did that pi...

42:36.095 --> 42:38.337
It's so funny. Okay, let's shoot this.

42:38.431 --> 42:41.970
- Can you get me that stool? I wanna sit over here.
- Okay. Sure.

42:42.060 --> 42:44.598
Can you guys change positions, like...

42:44.687 --> 42:46.474
Yeah, yeah. Good, good.

42:46.564 --> 42:49.602
- You're on your game today, babe.
- Oh, yeah.

42:49.692 --> 42:54.483
Here. Hold on. This is just... You know what?
It's weird, that sort of falling down.

42:54.572 --> 42:56.905
Can you just... Can we get the costume...

42:56.991 --> 43:00.450
- Do you know what? Fuck. Do you know what?
- What is it?

43:00.536 --> 43:04.280
I-I love these costumes,
and I know it's exactly what we talked about,

43:04.373 --> 43:06.285
but now that I'm seeing it all together,

43:06.375 --> 43:08.287
I'm just starting to feel like it's not...

43:08.377 --> 43:10.289
These costumes are from the prison theme.

43:10.379 --> 43:13.668
And I think now we're moving on
to this whole mother-and-daughter theme...

43:13.758 --> 43:16.195
- I think I was wrong. Can we change?
- What are you talking about?

43:16.219 --> 43:20.384
We've got two hot black chicks in space suits
with big hats and a white cat.

43:20.473 --> 43:23.386
Fuck off. Fuck off.
'Cause I just need to get this...

43:23.476 --> 43:25.579
- What do you want to change?
- Can you, uh...

43:25.603 --> 43:27.845
Let's just put them back
into the clothes they came in.

43:27.939 --> 43:29.146
Oh, my God.

43:29.232 --> 43:33.192
Well, it's... Yeah. Can we try that?

43:34.070 --> 43:35.356
Do you know what?

43:35.446 --> 43:37.938
Could you go and ask her mom

43:38.032 --> 43:41.400
if we could borrow her sweater
for the shoot?

43:41.494 --> 43:42.951
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

43:45.456 --> 43:47.823
Okay, good.

43:47.917 --> 43:49.658
Um...

43:49.752 --> 43:51.712
Madeline. Madeline.

43:51.754 --> 43:53.336
Just... You know what? Try...

43:53.422 --> 43:56.756
You know how you're really good
at getting, like, emotional on cue?

43:56.843 --> 44:00.211
Just try one this time
with, like, a lot of emotion.

44:00.304 --> 44:01.636
Any emotion?

44:01.722 --> 44:04.055
Yeah, like, um... I mean, just like...

44:04.142 --> 44:07.761
Think about how you felt when your mom
gave you the sex talk. Try that.

44:10.773 --> 44:12.309
That's really fucking good.

44:12.400 --> 44:16.394
More! Yes! Yes!

44:16.487 --> 44:19.480
Now just less. I mean, just like a little...

44:19.574 --> 44:22.066
That, but subtle. More subtle.

44:26.330 --> 44:29.073
Uh... Okay, wait.
Hold on. Hold on. I don't know.

44:29.167 --> 44:32.410
Maybe, just,
I didn't understand what you were...

44:33.796 --> 44:35.503
Okay, do you know, uh...

44:35.590 --> 44:39.755
What if it made you feel kind of sad?

44:39.844 --> 44:44.134
Like just thinking about what it means
for her, and it was, like, a lot more...

44:44.223 --> 44:45.930
Depressed?

44:47.143 --> 44:49.931
Yeah. Let's try that. Let's try that.

44:50.021 --> 44:52.729
Just... Just... Just for the photograph. Okay?

44:57.195 --> 44:59.232
Is that... That's depressed?

45:00.198 --> 45:02.656
A little bit more.

45:02.742 --> 45:05.450
More, more, more. Oh, good. Yeah.

45:05.536 --> 45:07.493
Oh, yeah. Good, good, good, good!
That's so good.

45:09.332 --> 45:12.575
Okay, great.
Can you turn and say something to KK?

45:17.965 --> 45:19.957
Yeah, KK. Perfect.

45:28.559 --> 45:30.596
Oh.

45:55.878 --> 45:58.712
Regina, could you come in here
for a second?

45:58.798 --> 46:01.506
I have an idea, and I was thinking...

46:01.592 --> 46:04.335
Um...

46:04.428 --> 46:08.342
I would love it if you would just pose
with Madeline for a minute and then...

46:08.432 --> 46:10.674
'Cause you're not... You won't be on camera.

46:10.768 --> 46:12.680
- The two of you together...
- Oh, my...

46:12.770 --> 46:15.183
We won't see you.
You won't be on camera. You'll be off.

46:15.273 --> 46:17.481
- Can you give her her sweater back?
- Yeah, sure.

46:17.566 --> 46:19.966
- Just give her her sweater.
- This sounds like a great idea.

46:20.027 --> 46:22.314
Okay, good. Good, good, good.

46:22.405 --> 46:24.442
- Just... Um...
- Yeah, I'm sorry.

46:24.532 --> 46:26.524
Okay, great.

46:26.617 --> 46:30.861
And then, um, I'm just thinking,

46:30.955 --> 46:34.539
like, we'll just get you and your mom
and something like a little less powerful,

46:34.625 --> 46:37.117
a little kind of more just...

46:38.254 --> 46:39.995
I don't know, but, uh, do you know...

46:40.089 --> 46:42.456
Actually, you know what?
Let's have you sit right here.

46:42.550 --> 46:44.758
So you're just looking at each other.
Okay?

46:45.928 --> 46:48.090
Thank you. Thank you very much.

46:48.180 --> 46:49.180
Oh!

46:49.223 --> 46:51.556
Don't worry about what I said
about the water bed.

46:54.395 --> 46:56.478
I know, I know. It's been...

46:56.564 --> 46:58.430
We've been workshopping for months.

46:58.524 --> 47:01.892
I'm not sure this is turning into a play.

47:01.986 --> 47:04.694
It is a play. It's not a <i>play</i> play.

47:04.780 --> 47:07.614
It's just not about making sense all the time.

47:07.700 --> 47:09.316
I don't know if you really need me.

47:09.410 --> 47:12.244
- You know, it's the story...
- A lot of us are barely in this anymore.

47:12.330 --> 47:14.117
Right. You know, actually...

47:14.206 --> 47:16.994
You're mostly using Madeline and KK.

47:17.084 --> 47:20.077
We all are in...
You're part of this collective.

47:20.171 --> 47:24.415
But if you... If you go now, what's that
going to say to everybody else?

47:24.508 --> 47:27.216
So let's get ready for doctors and nurses.

47:27.303 --> 47:30.216
Um, why don't you just stay for today?

47:31.599 --> 47:33.761
Now, who's, um, gonna play the patient?

47:33.851 --> 47:35.871
Ooh, I'll do it.
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'll do it.

47:35.895 --> 47:37.386
Madeline, you want to do it?

47:38.314 --> 47:40.146
I'm okay. Mm-hmm.

47:42.818 --> 47:44.650
I'm ready and waiting to go.

47:44.737 --> 47:47.571
Come on!

47:49.283 --> 47:52.617
Doctor? Doctor.

47:52.703 --> 47:55.036
Yeah, I'd like to do the improv
with the same characters

47:55.122 --> 48:00.789
and maybe try to generate text
and this time in a psychiatric ward, okay?

48:01.796 --> 48:03.287
Okay.

48:04.340 --> 48:06.798
What seems to be the problem?

48:06.884 --> 48:09.422
I'm sick.

48:10.304 --> 48:11.966
Yeah? What do you have?

48:12.056 --> 48:13.592
I'm de...

48:16.977 --> 48:18.218
Pregnant.

48:23.567 --> 48:25.524
Oh.

48:25.611 --> 48:28.103
With, uh...

48:28.197 --> 48:32.191
Hey, Madeline.
It's a psychiatric ward, not a pregnancy ward.

48:34.745 --> 48:38.079
My mom wants me to have an abortion,

48:38.165 --> 48:41.909
but, um, I'm gonna keep the baby.

48:42.002 --> 48:45.040
Wh... I mean, do you...

48:45.131 --> 48:47.669
Do you think you're... you're ready?

48:47.758 --> 48:51.752
I think I'm ready.
I... I want to take care of someone.

48:52.930 --> 48:54.887
Like she will.

48:58.477 --> 49:04.144
But I'm afraid that the birth will be horrible.

49:04.233 --> 49:06.065
How will it be horrible?

49:06.152 --> 49:07.859
Bloody and hard.

49:07.945 --> 49:13.907
What if the baby doesn't wanna come out?

49:13.993 --> 49:18.829
What if it's, like...

49:39.602 --> 49:42.094
And it dies inside of me.

49:46.942 --> 49:51.937
Let's take five minutes, and then we'll,
uh, regroup and try some more.

49:52.031 --> 49:53.522
Okay.

50:00.414 --> 50:02.952
Do I have a weird time?

50:03.042 --> 50:04.829
Yeah.

50:10.758 --> 50:13.250
Hey. It's just me.

50:13.344 --> 50:16.837
I was just saying hi.

50:18.349 --> 50:20.762
Oh, are you okay?

50:23.437 --> 50:27.431
Just ready to give birth, I guess.

50:33.697 --> 50:37.862
Yeah. Look, if you want
to be there with all the family, fine.

50:37.952 --> 50:40.615
I'll... That's fine.

50:43.499 --> 50:46.492
No, I said it's fine.

50:47.670 --> 50:49.878
Hey.

50:49.964 --> 50:52.251
Hello?

50:52.341 --> 50:54.173
Hello!

50:54.260 --> 50:56.422
Can I just talk about next week's rehearsal?

50:56.512 --> 50:58.799
Hey, guys. Where are you going?
Where are they all going?

50:58.889 --> 51:00.801
- See ya. Have a good one.
- See ya.

51:00.891 --> 51:02.382
- Um...
- Guys! Where...

51:03.269 --> 51:05.511
- I let everybody go.
- What?

51:05.604 --> 51:09.097
Hey, guys! Guys!
We're not done rehearsing.

51:09.191 --> 51:12.775
No, no, we are! We'll catch you next time!

51:12.861 --> 51:14.648
Madeline!

51:14.738 --> 51:17.481
Regina. Hi. Yeah. It's Evangeline.

51:17.575 --> 51:19.817
We, um... We finished rehearsal early,

51:19.910 --> 51:25.122
and so we were calling to see
if it would be all right with you

51:25.207 --> 51:28.325
if, um, Madeline came
to my house for dinner tonight.

51:28.419 --> 51:30.752
And then you wouldn't have
to come back and pick her up,

51:30.838 --> 51:34.172
and I could... I could drop her off
at, like, 9:30 or 10:00 or...

51:34.258 --> 51:37.092
Yeah, I hope that's okay. Everyone's leaving now.

51:37.177 --> 51:39.715
So I think I will just take her home and...

51:39.805 --> 51:44.015
Do you want to say something to her?
On the message.

52:18.677 --> 52:19.884
Aw!

52:19.970 --> 52:22.758
- M... Madeline. That's my husband George.
- Hi.

52:25.476 --> 52:27.889
You know what?

52:27.978 --> 52:30.641
Everybody?

52:30.731 --> 52:33.314
Madeline's a really great actress.

52:33.400 --> 52:37.485
Yeah. She's applied to a whole bunch
of really fantastic colleges

52:37.571 --> 52:40.188
like Juilliard and NYU.

52:40.282 --> 52:42.865
Yay, Madeline.

52:42.951 --> 52:46.535
Yeah. I-I really don't know
if I'll get in though.

52:46.622 --> 52:49.786
She's amazing. She could get
into any college that she wants.

52:49.875 --> 52:51.992
If Evangeline says it, it's true.

52:52.086 --> 52:54.203
Look what I've got for you guys!

52:54.296 --> 52:56.754
Here we come, here we come, here we come.

52:56.840 --> 52:59.503
- Better be good.
- Come on. Who said that? Who said that?

52:59.593 --> 53:01.880
You know I'm the one who said it.

53:01.970 --> 53:05.589
One for you, girl? Okay, good?

53:05.683 --> 53:07.702
Mama, I do that for you.
What about you, sweetheart?

53:07.726 --> 53:09.467
I'm a vegan.

53:09.561 --> 53:11.473
Vegan. All right. All right, vegan.

53:11.563 --> 53:13.896
I'm-a put this down here.
I'm-a take you out bread.

53:13.982 --> 53:15.974
- Do you want some bread?
- No, thank you.

53:16.068 --> 53:17.712
Okay, I'm-a leave you alone. Listen, guys.

53:17.736 --> 53:19.352
I'm-a be right back in a minute.

53:19.446 --> 53:22.860
Madeline was telling us
your show is about prison?

53:22.950 --> 53:25.567
Uh, no. No, it's not.

53:25.661 --> 53:26.947
It's... It's a metaphor.

53:27.037 --> 53:29.029
- Metaphor?
- No, it's not a metaphor.

53:29.123 --> 53:33.993
It's-It's, um... It's about mental illness.

53:34.086 --> 53:36.544
- And-And...
- Wow.

53:36.630 --> 53:38.963
Madeline is the lead.

53:39.049 --> 53:45.671
I'm really interested in people who are
out of control of their circumstances.

53:49.184 --> 53:50.891
Yeah.

54:01.155 --> 54:04.273
Oh, my God. Come here.

54:16.545 --> 54:18.537
Welcome to the nut show!

54:18.630 --> 54:21.373
Oh, no. Don't!

54:22.134 --> 54:24.251
What?

54:24.344 --> 54:27.712
Nut is a peanut because they pee a lot.

54:29.141 --> 54:30.632
Jason, no!

54:30.726 --> 54:32.718
- Okay.
- A nut...

54:33.645 --> 54:35.386
...can kill you!

54:35.481 --> 54:37.973
Em...

54:38.066 --> 54:39.807
You can't do that.

54:39.902 --> 54:43.737
You're making a huge mess here, and you
really can't stand on the couch, all right?

54:45.741 --> 54:48.108
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey.
- Give me a smile.

54:48.202 --> 54:50.194
Probably just a little tired.

54:50.287 --> 54:52.449
That's okay. It's all for you, sweetie.

54:55.751 --> 54:57.333
Where's Solomon?

54:57.419 --> 54:59.832
Come here.

54:59.922 --> 55:01.538
Don't worry about it.

55:01.632 --> 55:03.464
Really? That's it?

55:07.471 --> 55:09.053
Hey.

55:09.139 --> 55:11.552
Are you Evangeline's daughter?

55:13.894 --> 55:16.807
Blessings for the one that's on the way...

55:16.897 --> 55:18.138
Aw!

55:18.232 --> 55:22.522
and hopefully will grow
into an incredible host

55:22.611 --> 55:24.477
like Mom and Dad.

55:24.571 --> 55:26.233
Yes.

55:26.323 --> 55:29.031
This is for Evangeline and George.

55:29.117 --> 55:30.449
- Yes.
- Yes.

55:30.536 --> 55:33.074
- To future baby.
- Beautiful baby.

55:33.163 --> 55:36.327
Go ahead. Next we're gonna...

55:36.416 --> 55:40.456
- Aw!
- The future of enjoying family and friends.

55:40.546 --> 55:43.960
To the right.
Are you sure you're okay to...

55:44.049 --> 55:46.883
To go to the bathroom by myself?
Yeah, I'm fine. Thanks.

55:47.803 --> 55:49.294
Smile.

55:50.889 --> 55:53.176
Hi, Onur.

55:53.267 --> 55:55.930
You guys need help with cleaning up?

55:59.314 --> 56:01.180
- What?
- It was like pig face.

56:01.275 --> 56:03.858
- Pig face?
- Yeah, like pig face. You know, like...

56:08.448 --> 56:10.861
I'm gonna get me some more vino.

56:19.793 --> 56:22.627
My, what soft skin you have.

56:25.299 --> 56:27.291
I won't tell Evangeline.

56:36.852 --> 56:39.435
It's showtime. Showtime.

56:39.521 --> 56:41.513
Showtime.

56:45.736 --> 56:47.227
Whoo!

56:51.199 --> 56:53.191
I don't know.

57:01.084 --> 57:02.575
Okay.

57:09.927 --> 57:14.092
Oh. Oh. Oh!

57:14.181 --> 57:16.719
Ooh!

57:35.410 --> 57:39.404
Meow. Meow. Meow. Meow.

57:39.498 --> 57:44.118
Meow. Meow. Meow. Meow. Meow.

58:12.155 --> 58:14.238
She used to be in vaudeville, y'all.

58:14.324 --> 58:17.658
She's not that old.

58:17.744 --> 58:19.906
She's not that old.

58:19.997 --> 58:21.909
Mama, Mama. Mama.

58:29.881 --> 58:31.338
- Hey.
- Hi.

58:31.425 --> 58:33.838
- Hey. Mad... Made...
- Madeline.

58:33.927 --> 58:35.293
Madeline. Right. Right.

58:35.387 --> 58:37.504
- George.
- Yes.

58:37.597 --> 58:40.135
- How are you?
- I'm okay. How are you?

58:40.225 --> 58:41.807
Doing great.

58:41.893 --> 58:43.976
- You're really talented, you know?
- Oh.

58:44.062 --> 58:46.224
- Thanks.
- Yeah, you're welcome.

58:52.279 --> 58:53.895
- You need anything?
- So... Oh, no.

58:53.989 --> 58:55.605
- You good?
- I'm okay.

58:57.034 --> 58:59.401
You need anything?

58:59.494 --> 59:01.531
No, I got it. I got it.

59:01.621 --> 59:04.159
- They always leave it for me to clean up.
- Hmm.

59:04.249 --> 59:05.740
Uh-huh.

59:06.626 --> 59:08.868
So, um,

59:08.962 --> 59:11.796
how long have you and Evangeline
been together?

59:11.882 --> 59:14.420
Oh. We've been together five years.

59:14.509 --> 59:16.501
Five beautiful years.

59:17.596 --> 59:19.212
- Wow.
- Mm-hmm.

59:19.306 --> 59:24.643
That's funny,
because she has never mentioned you.

59:26.063 --> 59:27.599
She hasn't?

59:27.689 --> 59:29.396
Nope.

59:29.483 --> 59:32.601
That's my wife.

59:32.694 --> 59:34.606
That's my wife.

59:38.408 --> 59:39.899
Um...

59:41.411 --> 59:45.121
I am so happy I came to this party.

59:46.875 --> 59:49.492
- I'm glad you came too.
- Yeah.

59:49.586 --> 59:51.202
Had a good time?

59:51.296 --> 59:52.787
So great.

59:56.176 --> 59:59.465
Mmm. We enjoyed having you.

01:00:00.639 --> 01:00:02.631
- You sure you don't need anything?
- Yeah.

01:00:02.724 --> 01:00:04.215
Okay.

01:00:05.227 --> 01:00:06.763
There's more juice in the fridge.

01:00:06.853 --> 01:00:10.062
- I could grab you some juice or something.
- I don't need any juice.

01:00:10.148 --> 01:00:11.639
Okay.

01:00:14.194 --> 01:00:17.983
So, um, it's my birthday this weekend.

01:00:18.073 --> 01:00:20.235
Are you serious?

01:00:20.325 --> 01:00:22.487
Well, happy birthday. You're turning...

01:00:22.577 --> 01:00:24.614
- Seventeen.
- Seventeen.

01:00:24.704 --> 01:00:29.916
And do you know
what I am doing for my birthday?

01:00:30.001 --> 01:00:31.913
Mm-mmm.

01:00:32.003 --> 01:00:35.713
I'm going to lose my virginity.

01:00:38.760 --> 01:00:41.798
That's... That's great.

01:00:41.888 --> 01:00:44.847
That's great. Who's... Who's the...

01:00:44.933 --> 01:00:47.141
Um, who's the lucky guy?

01:00:47.227 --> 01:00:49.719
- I haven't decided yet.
- Okay.

01:00:49.813 --> 01:00:56.310
You know, if you have any recommendations

01:00:56.403 --> 01:00:59.111
for, like, a position or anything, for...

01:00:59.197 --> 01:01:00.938
'Cause I'm a beginner, you know.

01:01:01.032 --> 01:01:07.529
I was thinking that I could bend over,

01:01:07.622 --> 01:01:12.367
and he could squeeze my ass cheeks.

01:01:15.630 --> 01:01:17.212
Whoa. Hey.

01:01:31.104 --> 01:01:33.187
Were you drinking at my house, Madeline?

01:01:33.273 --> 01:01:35.265
Because you're not acting like yourself.

01:01:35.358 --> 01:01:37.941
You don't know myself. I am being myself.

01:01:38.028 --> 01:01:40.315
I do know you. I know you!

01:01:40.405 --> 01:01:42.613
Are you insecure?

01:01:43.867 --> 01:01:47.577
- What?
- Are you... insecure?

01:01:47.662 --> 01:01:49.619
I don't know! No. I mean no.

01:01:49.706 --> 01:01:53.666
I'm so... I'm not insecure.
I'm trying to do something that's really hard.

01:01:53.752 --> 01:01:56.995
And I am, you know,
holding down the fort on the whole project,

01:01:57.088 --> 01:02:01.002
and I'm spearheading this very
collaborative vision that is fucking just...

01:02:01.092 --> 01:02:03.675
kind of fucked.

01:02:03.762 --> 01:02:06.129
So, yes. I mean yes, I'm insecure,

01:02:06.223 --> 01:02:08.215
because I don't know
if the project's gonna work.

01:02:08.308 --> 01:02:11.176
I don't even know
if my fucking marriage is gonna work.

01:02:11.269 --> 01:02:13.261
And I don't...

01:02:16.608 --> 01:02:19.021
- Good.
- What? What's good?

01:02:19.110 --> 01:02:21.318
That you admitted it.

01:02:25.784 --> 01:02:27.776
I'm insecure too.

01:02:30.914 --> 01:02:33.622
It's why I want you to like me so much.

01:02:44.678 --> 01:02:46.670
I don't think...

01:02:48.848 --> 01:02:52.683
I don't think I should be
in your project anymore.

01:02:52.769 --> 01:02:54.385
What?

01:03:06.825 --> 01:03:08.032
Okay.

01:03:09.244 --> 01:03:12.533
I feel like, you know, we're...

01:03:12.622 --> 01:03:15.660
I think you might be right, Madeline.

01:03:15.750 --> 01:03:18.242
I think maybe you shouldn't
be in the project.

01:03:18.336 --> 01:03:22.671
And actually, it feels like a huge relief.

01:03:22.757 --> 01:03:25.670
I mean, I...
Of course, I want you to be in it,

01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:27.922
but...

01:03:28.013 --> 01:03:31.506
this doesn't feel like
it's good for either of us.

01:03:42.569 --> 01:03:44.401
What was that?

01:03:46.281 --> 01:03:48.273
What... Was it a cat?

01:03:48.366 --> 01:03:50.858
I don't know. Maybe it was nothing.

01:03:50.952 --> 01:03:53.160
Should... Should we check on it?

01:03:54.080 --> 01:03:56.288
- No, it's dead.
- Oh.

01:06:09.883 --> 01:06:11.545
<i>Hey, Madeline.</i>

01:06:11.634 --> 01:06:14.672
<i>We didn't see you at rehearsal today.
We hope you're okay.</i>

01:06:14.762 --> 01:06:16.503
Mmm.

01:06:18.808 --> 01:06:21.050
Mmm. Mmm.

01:06:25.148 --> 01:06:26.639
Madeline?

01:06:27.817 --> 01:06:29.979
Are you coming downstairs?

01:06:30.069 --> 01:06:32.402
Someone's here to see us.

01:06:38.411 --> 01:06:40.949
Madeline, is that you?

01:06:41.039 --> 01:06:44.658
My God. Last time, um,
they left out the mint lemon.

01:06:44.751 --> 01:06:46.162
I don't know why.

01:06:46.252 --> 01:06:48.244
As if I couldn't do it. Just put a tent up.

01:06:48.338 --> 01:06:49.545
What did I do? Nothing.

01:06:49.631 --> 01:06:52.499
But it's usually a lot more
than just putting a tent up.

01:06:52.592 --> 01:06:54.003
Right.

01:06:54.093 --> 01:06:57.131
Our board member Christa,
that's her favorite, first of all.

01:06:57.222 --> 01:06:59.305
So are the... Are they... Oh.

01:06:59.390 --> 01:07:04.181
Oh. Madeline. Look who's here.

01:07:04.270 --> 01:07:06.762
- Hi, Evangeline.
- She came to ask about you.

01:07:06.856 --> 01:07:09.815
- Hi.
- We've just been talking about, um...

01:07:09.901 --> 01:07:12.735
- Your mother's been telling me about her...
- The tent.

01:07:12.820 --> 01:07:15.779
- The tent. The event tent.
- Which you get because it's...

01:07:15.865 --> 01:07:19.279
Yes. It's, like, um, you know
all about that. You know, just...

01:07:19.369 --> 01:07:21.577
Yeah, I mean
I guess it's kind of the same.

01:07:21.663 --> 01:07:25.247
She said that you said you were pregnant?

01:07:25.333 --> 01:07:27.700
- And I told her...
- Well, just in the improv.

01:07:27.794 --> 01:07:29.626
absolutely, of course not.

01:07:29.712 --> 01:07:32.079
You're a virgin.
You've never even kissed a boy.

01:07:32.173 --> 01:07:35.507
We've really missed her.
I mean, she is amazing.

01:07:35.593 --> 01:07:37.380
You're an amazing actress.

01:07:37.470 --> 01:07:42.090
And just the capacity to go, you know...

01:07:42.183 --> 01:07:44.721
She has a lot of depth,

01:07:44.811 --> 01:07:46.347
and I'm sure it runs in the family.

01:07:46.437 --> 01:07:48.679
Yeah? I think so too.

01:07:48.773 --> 01:07:52.608
I mean, it might even be great
to just sort of have you... Do you act?

01:07:52.694 --> 01:07:54.651
Do you want to try something?

01:07:54.737 --> 01:07:57.195
Just, like, as a part
of the workshop, we could...

01:07:57.282 --> 01:07:59.444
Oh, my goodness. Um...

01:08:07.542 --> 01:08:10.034
I wonder what the plan is.

01:08:10.128 --> 01:08:14.122
Do you think... Is it that she saw
something about me?

01:08:14.215 --> 01:08:18.425
You know, because we were talking
for a long time there, and...

01:08:20.220 --> 01:08:24.841
<i>She is really freckly, which is something
she'll want to watch out for, you know?</i>

01:08:24.934 --> 01:08:27.517
<i>I hope she gets every one
of those things checked,</i>

01:08:27.604 --> 01:08:31.188
<i>because it only takes one.</i>

01:08:34.068 --> 01:08:35.684
I wonder if she's on top of that.

01:08:44.453 --> 01:08:47.242
- Hi.
- Hi, Regina.

01:08:47.332 --> 01:08:50.700
Everybody remember Regina?
I invited her to join us today.

01:08:50.792 --> 01:08:52.955
- Hi!
- Hi.

01:09:09.979 --> 01:09:12.437
Great, okay. So, let's, um...

01:09:12.523 --> 01:09:15.140
Let's rotate, and let's have a new leader.

01:09:15.234 --> 01:09:18.773
Regina, you want to step up front
and be the leader?

01:09:20.406 --> 01:09:23.694
Come on. It's fun.

01:09:23.785 --> 01:09:25.276
Okay.

01:09:29.749 --> 01:09:32.332
I don't know what to do.

01:09:40.593 --> 01:09:42.334
Just kind of what...

01:09:42.428 --> 01:09:48.049
Just make any kind of ordinary,
normal gesture that feels natural to you.

01:09:48.142 --> 01:09:50.259
- Pretend nobody else is here.
- Just...

01:09:53.773 --> 01:09:56.356
- Can I touch my purse?
- Sure.

01:09:56.442 --> 01:09:58.434
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:10:13.418 --> 01:10:15.159
Great.

01:10:16.713 --> 01:10:20.673
See how relaxed that was, everyone?
Just that relaxed gesture.

01:10:30.184 --> 01:10:32.096
Nice.

01:10:32.186 --> 01:10:34.178
But what kind of, like...?

01:10:35.148 --> 01:10:38.141
- Because I did that.
- Yes. Okay.

01:10:39.068 --> 01:10:40.559
Uh...

01:10:45.032 --> 01:10:49.242
That does always come...

01:10:49.328 --> 01:10:53.288
That was so great.
Thank you. That was fantastic.

01:11:18.441 --> 01:11:20.148
Hey, we're gonna clown your mom,

01:11:20.234 --> 01:11:22.521
so just copy her walk
and gestures and stuff.

01:11:22.612 --> 01:11:24.774
- You can sit down if you want.
- Okay.

01:11:24.864 --> 01:11:28.198
Just go one at a time.
Do you want to go next?

01:12:06.239 --> 01:12:10.859
You really shouldn't use hand sanitizer
like that. It dries out your skin.

01:12:14.121 --> 01:12:16.454
Oh, what sweater should I wear?

01:12:16.541 --> 01:12:19.124
The one with floral or the one with floral?

01:12:31.222 --> 01:12:33.339
The mood swings.

01:12:33.432 --> 01:12:36.140
They can be so bad sometimes.

01:12:37.645 --> 01:12:40.604
High, low.
You never know where you're gonna go.

01:12:40.690 --> 01:12:44.434
Throwing things, hitting me.

01:12:46.279 --> 01:12:49.272
But I love you no matter what

01:12:49.365 --> 01:12:51.448
because you're my daughter.

01:12:51.534 --> 01:12:53.400
Were you smoking?

01:12:53.494 --> 01:12:58.239
I can smell it on you!
Go take a shower, for Christ's sakes.

01:13:02.044 --> 01:13:05.162
Do you want some pancakes?

01:13:07.133 --> 01:13:08.840
Pancakes!

01:13:10.386 --> 01:13:14.551
I know you hate butter.

01:13:14.640 --> 01:13:18.725
Yes. Will you eat anything?

01:13:19.812 --> 01:13:21.428
Anything?

01:13:21.522 --> 01:13:23.855
See, Damon eats.

01:13:23.941 --> 01:13:30.029
Damon fucking eats. And he keeps it in.

01:13:30.114 --> 01:13:32.902
You're not going to rehearsal on Friday

01:13:32.992 --> 01:13:36.451
if you don't eat these pancakes.

01:13:38.205 --> 01:13:41.073
When you were a... just a little baby,

01:13:41.167 --> 01:13:43.625
I stroked your head so soft.

01:13:45.713 --> 01:13:50.629
I-I... I said to myself...
I said, "This baby, she's so perfect.

01:13:53.554 --> 01:13:55.841
She's gonna be so strong."

01:13:58.726 --> 01:14:01.309
And look at you now.

01:14:01.395 --> 01:14:03.682
You are sick.

01:14:04.941 --> 01:14:07.775
You are so sick that you...

01:14:09.153 --> 01:14:11.486
No, Madeline.

01:14:11.572 --> 01:14:13.438
Madeline, no.

01:14:13.532 --> 01:14:16.275
Madeline, you're scaring me.

01:14:19.205 --> 01:14:22.824
Damon, tell her to... Put it down!

01:14:22.917 --> 01:14:25.375
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

01:14:25.461 --> 01:14:28.875
My hand! My hand!

01:14:52.196 --> 01:14:54.028
Wow.

01:15:08.462 --> 01:15:10.374
Wow.

01:15:10.464 --> 01:15:13.172
Oh, my God.

01:15:13.259 --> 01:15:16.252
Oh, my God. That was so great.

01:15:17.513 --> 01:15:21.097
That was so amazing.

01:15:22.059 --> 01:15:25.268
- Oh, my God. Are you okay?
- Yes.

01:15:25.354 --> 01:15:28.267
You're so good. That was amazing.

01:15:28.357 --> 01:15:32.476
Did you guys see that?
Oh, my God. That was amazing.

01:15:32.570 --> 01:15:34.778
Wow.

01:15:34.864 --> 01:15:36.730
Oh!

01:15:36.824 --> 01:15:38.986
Wow. I, uh...

01:15:42.371 --> 01:15:46.991
This... This is the play.
This is immersive theater.

01:15:47.752 --> 01:15:50.540
Wow.

01:15:53.174 --> 01:15:54.710
Okay.

01:15:54.800 --> 01:15:56.712
Okay.

01:15:56.802 --> 01:15:59.385
I was thinking we were
gonna do something else,

01:15:59.472 --> 01:16:04.388
but I think that, in light
of this powerful new work,

01:16:04.477 --> 01:16:07.390
we should, uh...

01:16:07.480 --> 01:16:13.272
Let's everybody pick a piece, just a section
of the improv that Madeline just did,

01:16:13.360 --> 01:16:17.104
and then we will make a dance.

01:16:17.198 --> 01:16:19.315
Make a dance of it and, um...

01:16:19.408 --> 01:16:23.197
When you talk about this being the play,

01:16:23.287 --> 01:16:25.244
is this about Madeline?

01:16:26.499 --> 01:16:28.536
Well, no, no.

01:16:28.626 --> 01:16:32.119
I mean, it's about a character
that we've been work...

01:16:32.213 --> 01:16:34.330
you know, creating together called Zia.

01:16:34.423 --> 01:16:37.791
- It's about a character.
- And it's Madeline's story.

01:16:37.885 --> 01:16:40.002
No, Zia.

01:16:40.096 --> 01:16:41.678
- Her name is Zia.
- Zia.

01:16:41.764 --> 01:16:44.757
And she's comfortable with that.
You're comfortable with that?

01:16:44.850 --> 01:16:49.220
With us telling your story?

01:16:49.313 --> 01:16:51.225
I mean...

01:16:51.315 --> 01:16:56.686
So you're going to tell the story
of the inside of her brain.

01:17:03.202 --> 01:17:04.283
Yes.

01:17:05.246 --> 01:17:06.737
Okay.

01:17:07.581 --> 01:17:08.913
What?

01:17:10.167 --> 01:17:11.954
You know, I'm just saying.

01:17:12.044 --> 01:17:15.958
I mean, you, right?

01:17:16.048 --> 01:17:17.380
And her.

01:17:17.466 --> 01:17:20.254
- I mean, just, like, think about the optics of...
- I... Yes.

01:17:20.344 --> 01:17:22.256
It's her story. It's also my story.

01:17:22.346 --> 01:17:24.713
It's everyone in this room's story.

01:17:38.904 --> 01:17:42.818
We could keep talking,
but I think we could put it in the work.

01:17:42.908 --> 01:17:44.444
Okay?

01:17:44.535 --> 01:17:46.429
So, I think we have about 20 minutes.

01:17:46.453 --> 01:17:48.740
- Bless you.
- I'm so sorry.

01:17:48.831 --> 01:17:50.197
- Excuse me.
- It's okay.

01:17:50.291 --> 01:17:52.394
- I'm sorry.
- We have about 20 minutes? Twenty minutes?

01:17:52.418 --> 01:17:54.258
- Yeah, we have 20 minutes.
- About 20 minutes.

01:17:54.336 --> 01:17:57.829
Get together in groups of three,
and, uh... and we'll reconvene.

01:17:57.923 --> 01:17:59.630
Okay?

01:17:59.717 --> 01:18:01.208
This is...

01:18:02.178 --> 01:18:04.261
Sorry, I have to take this.

01:18:04.346 --> 01:18:05.837
Okay.

01:18:13.397 --> 01:18:15.104
Yeah, so we should, um...

01:18:18.485 --> 01:18:20.485
Yeah, no, I just wanted to tell you...

01:18:20.529 --> 01:18:22.862
- Um...
- Sorry. I know I'm supposed to meet you there,

01:18:22.948 --> 01:18:25.361
but I-I'm still here.

01:18:25.451 --> 01:18:28.410
I just... Yeah, uh...

01:18:28.495 --> 01:18:30.487
Does anyone want to join our group?

01:18:36.378 --> 01:18:38.370
How you doing?

01:18:52.436 --> 01:18:54.803
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

01:18:54.897 --> 01:18:57.890
Hmm.

01:18:57.983 --> 01:19:00.396
Hmm.

01:19:15.668 --> 01:19:17.660
I know you feel it's urgent.

01:19:17.753 --> 01:19:19.665
It's not urgent.

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.208
<i>I'll callyou back, okay? Bye.</i>

01:20:04.758 --> 01:20:07.341
Guys! Guys! Open the door!

01:20:09.513 --> 01:20:13.302
Guys! Open the door.

01:20:14.101 --> 01:20:17.344
Just... Wait. Oh, God.

01:20:20.316 --> 01:20:23.275
Okay. Okay.

01:20:23.360 --> 01:20:25.568
Ugh. Fuckers.

01:20:28.365 --> 01:20:30.197
- Max, what the fuck?
- Hey, sorry.

01:20:30.284 --> 01:20:32.012
- Come down here and open the door.
- I can't.

01:20:32.036 --> 01:20:33.596
- I can't let you in just yet.
- What do you mean, you can't?

01:20:33.620 --> 01:20:34.986
You're my assistant.

01:20:35.080 --> 01:20:37.440
- I know, but we need to talk, okay?
- What are you wearing?

01:20:38.542 --> 01:20:40.625
- You take that.
- You want a sweater?

01:20:40.711 --> 01:20:43.044
And take that.

01:20:43.130 --> 01:20:44.416
- Wear the mask.
- Okay.

01:20:44.506 --> 01:20:46.213
Wear the mask.

01:20:46.300 --> 01:20:50.340
Yes. Give me the line, but two weeks ago.

01:20:50.429 --> 01:20:51.920
- What about the whiskers?
- What?

01:20:52.014 --> 01:20:53.721
- Whiskers!
- No whiskers.

01:20:53.807 --> 01:20:55.298
Aaah!

01:21:00.189 --> 01:21:02.431
She's coming. She's coming. She's coming.

01:21:02.524 --> 01:21:04.265
- You ready?
- Ready.

01:21:04.360 --> 01:21:06.192
- Right there.
- Okay.

01:21:06.278 --> 01:21:08.645
- Somebody get the lights.
- I'll get 'em.

01:21:11.116 --> 01:21:13.324
Okay.

01:21:18.624 --> 01:21:23.289
<i>It's a long road
getting to here, to you, and, um...</i>

01:21:23.379 --> 01:21:25.962
<i>I made pancakes!</i>

01:21:26.048 --> 01:21:28.506
<i>Pancakes!</i>

01:21:28.592 --> 01:21:30.925
<i>Honestly, I think what she's taking
isn't working at all.</i>

01:21:31.011 --> 01:21:32.422
<i>Maybe we could make a plan.</i>

01:21:32.513 --> 01:21:35.051
<i>I think what she's taking
isn't working at all.</i>

01:21:35.140 --> 01:21:37.974
<i>Have you been smoking?</i>

01:21:46.860 --> 01:21:49.193
<i>Madeline! It'sjust me!</i>

01:21:49.279 --> 01:21:50.770
<i>Hello!</i>

01:22:04.086 --> 01:22:05.577
D...

01:22:18.434 --> 01:22:19.925
Madeline!

01:22:24.189 --> 01:22:26.772
- Stop it!
- Good!

01:22:33.198 --> 01:22:34.359
Jesus.

01:22:34.450 --> 01:22:36.191
Give me that. Give me that!

01:22:36.285 --> 01:22:38.698
Give it to me.

01:22:50.090 --> 01:22:51.297
Madeline!

01:22:54.511 --> 01:22:57.299
Stop it!

01:22:58.182 --> 01:23:00.048
Stop!

01:23:00.142 --> 01:23:01.553
Get off me!

01:23:11.361 --> 01:23:12.852
Madeline?

01:23:32.049 --> 01:23:35.042
Madeline. Madeline.

01:23:38.055 --> 01:23:39.637
Great job.

01:23:39.723 --> 01:23:42.340
You know, you're obviously
taking a lot of risks, and I...

01:23:42.434 --> 01:23:45.302
think you're so talented, you know?

01:23:45.395 --> 01:23:47.057
But if we're gonna collaborate,

01:23:47.147 --> 01:23:50.015
I think we should talk about
a process that's a little more...

01:23:50.108 --> 01:23:53.601
Listen.

01:23:53.695 --> 01:23:56.904
This is done. I think this is done now.
Okay. Everybody?

01:23:56.990 --> 01:23:59.073
Everybody, I think this is done now!

01:23:59.159 --> 01:24:02.869
So thank you very much, everybody!
Great job.

01:24:02.955 --> 01:24:04.446
Hey!

01:24:09.336 --> 01:24:11.373
Just stop! Stop!

01:24:11.463 --> 01:24:13.455
No!

01:24:29.273 --> 01:24:31.731
It's a miracle.

01:24:46.164 --> 01:24:47.655
Mother.
