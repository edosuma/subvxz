<i>VAST: Free</i>

00:12.976 --> 00:14.352
<i>It's time to laugh</i>

00:14.478 --> 00:16.055
<i>It's time to cry</i>

00:16.187 --> 00:18.643
<i>It's time to be what you need to be</i>

00:18.774 --> 00:21.347
<i>It won't be long till they are gone</i>

00:21.485 --> 00:23.892
<i>And we can be what we want to be</i>

00:24.029 --> 00:26.734
<i>I'm gonna run from everything</i>

00:26.865 --> 00:29.154
<i>Everything that holds me down</i>

00:29.284 --> 00:31.858
<i>Nothing to win, nothing to lose... </i>

00:31.995 --> 00:34.996
- You're late.
- Thursday night. Traffic on the Strip.

00:35.123 --> 00:37.199
Like every night. We're on a deadline. Go.

00:42.339 --> 00:44.332
(Siren)

00:47.302 --> 00:49.094
Man versus gravity.

00:50.305 --> 00:52.013
Man lost.

00:52.140 --> 00:54.382
I think that was his point.

00:54.518 --> 00:56.309
- Hello, Bob.
- Hey, Brian.

00:56.436 --> 00:58.014
Grissom, what are you doing here?

00:58.146 --> 01:01.847
- What do you think?
- I didn't alert Homicide.

01:01.984 --> 01:04.309
Dispatch called. The body's on county property.

01:04.444 --> 01:06.686
Well, we're not looking at a crime here.

01:06.822 --> 01:09.229
Bob explained it to me on the phone.

01:09.366 --> 01:11.405
His guy was alone up there

01:11.535 --> 01:13.860
He jumped. This is suicide.

01:13.996 --> 01:16.569
- Then why are you here, Sheriff?
- Look er...

01:16.707 --> 01:19.079
Roger Valenti was an unhappy guy.

01:19.209 --> 01:21.202
Money problems, family problems...

01:21.336 --> 01:22.878
He took the easy way out.

01:23.005 --> 01:26.539
It's a tragedy, but it is not a crime.

01:27.759 --> 01:29.337
Suicide, huh?

01:29.469 --> 01:31.047
I don't know Brian

01:31.179 --> 01:33.967
On the day you decide to end your life,

01:34.099 --> 01:36.008
why would you go to work?

01:38.000 --> 01:44.074

02:12.596 --> 02:18.302
1,400 new beds means 1,400 criminals
off the street. That old jail's maxed.

02:18.435 --> 02:21.519
The prison population's increased by 10%
in one year.

02:21.647 --> 02:24.019
If this place isn't built soon, you do the math.

02:25.192 --> 02:28.358
You look like the Sheriff,
but you talk like the Mayor.

02:28.487 --> 02:31.441
Mr Harris, do you get an extra bonus
for early completion?

02:31.573 --> 02:33.649
20 grand a day. I'm 10 days ahead.

02:33.784 --> 02:37.449
Wow. $200,000.
You must work your guys pretty hard, huh?

02:47.798 --> 02:51.878
- Where was Valenti's work station?
- He had the whole floor to himself.

02:52.010 --> 02:53.967
Valenti was usually my first guy up.

02:54.096 --> 02:56.503
He would drill the holes for the safety cables.

02:57.724 --> 03:01.674
No-one walks a new slab until
the cables are looped around the perimeter.

03:01.812 --> 03:03.436
(Car horns and sirens)

03:09.695 --> 03:12.861
Terminal velocity
is 9.8 metres per second squared.

03:12.990 --> 03:16.275
He would have hit the ground
in under five seconds.

03:56.325 --> 04:00.322
- Did this belong to Mr Valenti?
- Well, like I said, he was the only one up here.

04:03.874 --> 04:06.543
This drill has shorted out.

04:06.668 --> 04:10.369
Do you think he jumped before or after
he got the shock of his life?

04:10.505 --> 04:12.498
GFCI would have prevented shock.

04:12.633 --> 04:13.831
What is GFCI?

04:13.967 --> 04:16.007
The Ground-Fault Circuit Interrupter.

04:16.136 --> 04:18.923
Big words meaning he won't get electrocuted.

04:20.140 --> 04:22.845
You see, if there's an electrical imbalance,

04:22.976 --> 04:26.844
then the GFCI trips the circuit
and the tool's supposed to shut itself off.

04:30.943 --> 04:35.735
But if the third prong of the plug is compromised,
the interrupter won't work.

04:35.864 --> 04:37.027
Will it, Bob?

04:37.157 --> 04:38.900
The third prong grounds the drill.

04:39.034 --> 04:41.027
Without it, the interrupter's useless.

04:41.161 --> 04:44.660
These prongs don't usually snap off
by themselves.

05:02.307 --> 05:05.676
Are all your workers
this careless with their tools?

05:09.147 --> 05:11.817
Do you mind telling me what you're doing?

05:11.900 --> 05:15.649
These cutters may have been used
to tamper with the grounding prong.

05:15.779 --> 05:18.270
What happened to good old dusting for prints?

05:18.407 --> 05:20.695
When your crime scene is 12 storeys up...

05:22.286 --> 05:24.278
...I don't wanna take any chances.

05:26.748 --> 05:28.326
I'm gonna lock in these prints.

05:40.971 --> 05:43.129
Hey, O'Riley. We got the 419.

05:44.266 --> 05:47.136
Dylan Buckley. 14 years old.

05:52.024 --> 05:53.482
The paramedics pronounced

05:53.609 --> 05:55.269
The coroner's on his way

05:57.571 --> 05:59.279
Was he home alone?

06:00.407 --> 06:02.483
Not alone. Not his home.

06:06.079 --> 06:08.784
Catherine Willows, Nick Stokes. Crime Lab.

06:09.916 --> 06:11.079
Dr Leigh Sapien.

06:11.209 --> 06:12.490
This is her residence

06:12.628 --> 06:14.252
On good

06:14.379 --> 06:15.411
Then you can fill us in.

06:15.547 --> 06:18.216
- We were in the middle of a session.
- You're a therapist?

06:18.342 --> 06:22.209
- Psychiatrist.
- And why were you seeing Dylan?

06:22.346 --> 06:23.756
Doctor-patient privilege.

06:23.889 --> 06:26.012
Privilege doesn't extend post mortem.

06:26.141 --> 06:27.884
We can get a warrant for your records.

06:28.018 --> 06:31.517
No need. Dylan suffered from
reactive-attachment disorder.

06:31.647 --> 06:35.062
Issues with his mother.
I'd been treating him for 16 months.

06:35.192 --> 06:36.686
It's ten o'clock at night.

06:36.818 --> 06:38.277
Is this your home?

06:38.403 --> 06:40.230
I see my patients whenever they need me.

06:40.364 --> 06:43.151
On weekends, at night, at the office or here.

06:43.283 --> 06:45.442
Why don't you... just tell us what happened?

06:45.577 --> 06:48.827
Dylan had an argument with his mother.
He needed to unload.

06:48.956 --> 06:51.447
He was complaining about his curfew

06:51.583 --> 06:53.825
blaming his mother for problems at school

06:53.961 --> 06:55.953
Suddenly he began to convulse

06:58.715 --> 07:02.380
I tried to stabilise his head,
but it was a grand mal seizure.

07:04.846 --> 07:06.506
Dylan was an epileptic.

07:06.640 --> 07:08.383
He hit his head.

07:08.517 --> 07:11.008
And when the convulsions stopped,
he was dead.

07:11.144 --> 07:12.687
Did you try to revive him?

07:12.813 --> 07:14.556
Of course Standard CPR

07:14.690 --> 07:17.394
Cleared his airway, worked his chest.

07:20.612 --> 07:24.112
I... take it this wasn't his first convulsion?

07:24.241 --> 07:26.910
He was diagnosed with epilepsy at age three.

07:27.995 --> 07:30.118
W-What are you doing?

07:30.247 --> 07:32.785
Catherine, we need to get
a tape lift here, please.

07:39.172 --> 07:40.999
Look, I dialled 911.

07:42.134 --> 07:43.296
I'm not hiding anything.

07:43.427 --> 07:45.218
Well...

07:45.345 --> 07:47.254
I can see that.

07:56.398 --> 08:00.063
Quick. Name three human bones
that can withstand a 12-storey drop.

08:00.193 --> 08:03.776
The bones of the inner ear -
malleus, incus, stapes.

08:03.905 --> 08:07.571
High cellular density,
completely protected by the skull. Why?

08:07.701 --> 08:10.951
They appear to be the only bones
not fractured or broken.

08:11.079 --> 08:13.202
I wanna see the entry and exit wounds.

08:13.332 --> 08:16.866
He wasn't shot. This guy fell off
the new jailhouse. Are we on the same case?

08:17.002 --> 08:20.702
- He fell after he was electrocuted.
- News to me.

08:20.839 --> 08:23.544
I didn't find any physical evidence
of electrocution.

08:23.675 --> 08:25.335
Faulty drill.

08:25.469 --> 08:27.675
There should be burn marks
on one of his palms.

08:30.682 --> 08:32.509
Negative on the burn marks

08:32.643 --> 08:36.058
In most electrocution cases, capillaries rupture,

08:36.188 --> 08:39.308
haemoglobin leaks into the perivascular tissue.

08:39.441 --> 08:42.892
Right. Creating a fern-like pattern on the chest.

08:48.909 --> 08:51.067
His body contradicts your crime scene.

08:51.203 --> 08:53.990
I don't care what his body says.
This guy was electrocuted.

08:54.122 --> 08:55.367
It was not an accident.

09:09.263 --> 09:10.211
What?

09:10.347 --> 09:11.971
I don't know what I'm looking for.

09:12.099 --> 09:15.218
Signs of charring or melting.
You've done this before.

09:15.352 --> 09:17.143
Yean but

09:17.271 --> 09:18.848
we always go back to the body.

09:18.981 --> 09:20.523
The body tells the story.

09:20.649 --> 09:24.516
And, in this case, the body says
there was no crime and you're not listening.

09:25.654 --> 09:26.603
Why?

09:26.738 --> 09:28.731
Now and then we have to break the rules.

09:28.865 --> 09:31.570
Start with the conclusion
and work our way backwards.

09:31.702 --> 09:34.240
Like when we don't agree with
the coroner's report?

09:34.371 --> 09:35.746
Like, for instance,

09:35.872 --> 09:39.158
in the 1800s...
when surgery was Russian roulette

09:39.293 --> 09:41.202
and patients were dying on the tables.

09:41.336 --> 09:43.910
- Germs?
- Until Louis Pasteur theorised

09:44.047 --> 09:47.084
that something we could not see
was attacking the patients.

09:47.217 --> 09:49.376
- Relevance?
- Bodies tell us stories

09:49.511 --> 09:52.547
because we interpret them
how our predecessors taught us to.

09:52.681 --> 09:55.552
Not seeing something
doesn't mean that it's not there.

10:08.488 --> 10:09.947
Wires are crossed.

10:11.742 --> 10:13.366
Polarity's been reversed.

10:16.246 --> 10:19.698
This confirms that
someone tampered with Valenti's drill.

10:22.377 --> 10:27.086
The rubber soles of his boots
should have protected him from electrical shock.

10:27.215 --> 10:32.257
That's why you're safe in a car during a lightning
storm - you're insulated by the rubber tyres.

10:36.099 --> 10:39.634
Rubber's an insulator, but metal's a conductor.

10:39.770 --> 10:41.727
What form of metal hides in plain view

10:41.855 --> 10:43.397
at a construction site?

10:48.612 --> 10:50.651
A nail

10:59.373 --> 11:00.321
Hey

11:00.457 --> 11:03.493
How's that palm print
Grissom got off those cutters?

11:03.627 --> 11:06.118
Good. I'm running it through AFIS right now.

11:06.254 --> 11:08.212
Good thing is, the jailhouse is a union gig,

11:08.340 --> 11:10.795
and all the union guys
are already in the database.

11:10.926 --> 11:12.800
What I did for the print was I lined up

11:12.928 --> 11:17.590
the ridge detail from the partial
that I found on each handle.

11:17.724 --> 11:19.302
Nice.

11:20.435 --> 11:22.179
(Sighs) So...

11:22.312 --> 11:24.305
you think that guy fried before he fell?

11:24.439 --> 11:26.812
I don't know. We found a nail in his boot.

11:26.942 --> 11:29.267
It could have pierced the protective rubber.

11:29.403 --> 11:32.985
It might have allowed electricity
to course through his body.

11:33.115 --> 11:35.191
Bobby Dawson's taking odds.

11:35.325 --> 11:37.318
2 to 1, Grissom's wrong.

11:37.452 --> 11:41.117
5 to 1, he gets suspended
for shutting down that jailhouse.

11:42.249 --> 11:44.574
- 10 to 1...
- Fired.

11:46.253 --> 11:47.332
(Beeping)

11:49.798 --> 11:51.589
Sounds like you got a match

11:53.594 --> 11:55.301
Hey Gris

11:55.429 --> 11:57.089
How long have you been there?

11:57.222 --> 11:58.337
Yeah. Yeah, we do.

11:59.391 --> 12:01.597
The um... It's a former union guy,

12:01.727 --> 12:04.763
turned night-shift project manager.

12:04.896 --> 12:06.177
Robert Harris.

12:06.315 --> 12:07.725
Does that name mean anything?

12:07.858 --> 12:08.937
Yeah.

12:09.067 --> 12:10.692
Especially if you bet against me.

12:18.785 --> 12:23.115
My prints are on the cutters because they're on
everything at the site. I'm the project manager.

12:23.248 --> 12:24.742
There's no mystery here.

12:24.875 --> 12:27.959
You are, but you don't actually use
all the tools, right?

12:28.086 --> 12:29.878
I'm vigilant about safety.

12:30.005 --> 12:32.922
I'm always inspecting the equipment, tools...

12:33.050 --> 12:35.457
Look, this is what's going to happen here.

12:35.594 --> 12:39.805
The construction site is going to reopen
and the investigation goes away.

12:39.932 --> 12:42.849
Sure. After the lab processes all the evidence.

12:43.977 --> 12:45.555
Excuse me.

12:48.440 --> 12:51.227
For the record,
I don't like being put in the middle.

12:51.360 --> 12:52.558
Who does?

12:52.694 --> 12:56.395
I did a little homework on the guy
who took a nose dive after he was electrocuted.

12:56.531 --> 12:58.524
Three days ago he was voted union rep.

12:58.659 --> 13:01.410
Demanded more overtime pay.
Pressed for a walkout.

13:01.536 --> 13:04.206
- Motive?
- Right.

13:05.332 --> 13:06.956
Oh, in case you're interested,

13:07.084 --> 13:09.491
Bob Harris was the Sheriff's best man.

13:15.968 --> 13:19.550
- What was that about?
- Oh... We're in a bowling league together.

13:19.680 --> 13:21.886
- Can we wrap this up?
- Sure.

13:22.015 --> 13:24.471
Someone tampered with Roger Valenti's drill.

13:25.602 --> 13:27.013
And I have only one suspect.

13:27.145 --> 13:29.138
I read the coroner's prelim.

13:29.273 --> 13:32.108
There is nothing in it about electrocution.

13:32.234 --> 13:33.562
That's why it's a "prelim".

13:34.778 --> 13:37.483
Mr Harris, were you against
Valenti's union activities?

13:37.614 --> 13:40.401
Of course not. I'm a union man myself.

13:40.534 --> 13:42.823
You're fishing, Gil. We're done here.

13:42.953 --> 13:44.328
Moving on.

14:37.466 --> 14:40.632
Mrs Buckley, do you have someone
to drive you home?

14:41.845 --> 14:43.636
- Mrs Buckley?
- Yes?

14:43.764 --> 14:46.089
Do you have someone to drive you home?

14:46.224 --> 14:48.894
Oh, er... Thank you, I'll be all right.

14:53.565 --> 14:55.890
- Mrs Buckley?
- Yeah.

14:56.026 --> 14:59.312
I'm Nick Stokes, Crime Lab.
I've been assigned your son's case.

14:59.446 --> 15:02.447
- Crime Lab?
- It's... protocol.

15:04.326 --> 15:06.568
We were... just having pizza together.

15:06.703 --> 15:08.162
He seemed fine and...

15:08.288 --> 15:11.040
I dropped him off at Dr Sapien's and...

15:15.295 --> 15:19.079
My husband passed away three years ago
and now my...

15:30.769 --> 15:32.596
...my baby's gone.

15:34.648 --> 15:36.107
I understand.

15:37.818 --> 15:40.487
If you'll excuse me,
I need to go and make arrangements.

15:40.570 --> 15:41.602
Sure.

15:44.283 --> 15:46.275
I'm sorry for your loss.

15:48.120 --> 15:49.697
Thank you.

16:03.135 --> 16:05.127
My youngest just turned 14.

16:05.262 --> 16:06.970
Tough age.

16:09.600 --> 16:11.307
Cause of death?

16:11.435 --> 16:15.384
Cranial cerebral injuries.
Comminuted fractures of the occipital bone.

16:21.695 --> 16:24.233
Injuries consistent with a grand mal seizure?

16:24.364 --> 16:26.321
First blush, yes.

16:26.450 --> 16:28.656
Waiting on toxicology. In the meantime,

16:28.785 --> 16:30.659
check out his torso.

16:30.787 --> 16:33.195
He's covered in bruises

16:33.332 --> 16:35.870
Possibly from being thrashed
during the seizure?

16:36.001 --> 16:37.032
Possibly.

16:38.503 --> 16:40.710
I found tan fibres on his boxers.

16:40.839 --> 16:43.544
You, too, huh? His body's covered in them.

16:43.675 --> 16:48.005
Fibres on his body, his underwear,
but not on his shirt and pants. Why?

16:48.138 --> 16:51.388
Maybe it's as simple as
he wasn't wearing his shirt and pants.

16:51.516 --> 16:54.720
Then, at some point, he was with his shrink...
in his underwear.

16:54.853 --> 16:57.391
Exactly what kind of therapy was this?

17:25.592 --> 17:27.799
- Gil Grissom?
- Yes.

17:27.928 --> 17:31.344
I have information... about Roger Valenti.

17:31.473 --> 17:33.216
Call Jim Brass at Homicide.

17:35.852 --> 17:39.767
I was the union rep before Roger.
The walkout was my idea.

17:39.898 --> 17:41.392
Bob Harris...

17:41.525 --> 17:43.517
threatened me and my family.

17:44.736 --> 17:48.401
I wouldn't betray the union,
so I gave up my position at the local.

17:48.532 --> 17:50.738
Roger... picked up where I left off.

17:50.867 --> 17:52.243
Why are you telling me this?

17:52.369 --> 17:53.863
Because it could have been me.

17:56.039 --> 17:57.831
Cheese...

17:57.958 --> 17:59.500
milk...

18:00.627 --> 18:01.658
...sweaters.

18:01.795 --> 18:04.547
What do these things have in common?

18:04.673 --> 18:07.045
Goat cheese. Goat milk.

18:07.175 --> 18:09.548
- Goat... sweaters?
- Angora.

18:09.678 --> 18:12.928
Ding, ding, ding!
Fibres from the lady shrink, fibres from the boy.

18:13.056 --> 18:14.800
Both are angora

18:14.933 --> 18:16.641
Angora is processed goat hair?

18:16.768 --> 18:17.966
Mm-hm.

18:18.103 --> 18:21.389
Sheared, washed, spun and dyed.
Angora is 100% goat.

18:22.524 --> 18:23.935
You didn't know that, Nick?

18:25.986 --> 18:27.979
- Must be a chick thing.
- (Laughs)

18:29.448 --> 18:31.025
(Yawns)

18:32.159 --> 18:33.819
I need to see the body again.

18:33.952 --> 18:36.870
- No can do. Released six hours ago.
- Final report?

18:36.997 --> 18:41.077
Another 24, but there's nothing
to support Valenti was electrocuted.

18:41.209 --> 18:44.543
- Doc, please.
- You want to look at my notes.

18:47.341 --> 18:49.298
So, what have you got?

18:49.426 --> 18:51.834
I mean, anything unusual, even the mundane.

18:51.970 --> 18:55.422
His troponin enzymes are elevated.

18:55.557 --> 18:58.428
They become elevated
after ventricular fibrillation,

18:58.560 --> 19:00.469
which could be caused by electrocution.

19:00.604 --> 19:03.724
Sure, but troponin is found
in all victims of cardiac arrest.

19:03.857 --> 19:05.850
Most of whom have not been zapped.

19:05.984 --> 19:07.063
Work with me, will you?

19:07.194 --> 19:10.942
Er... Vic also had an elevated concentration
of iron in his blood.

19:11.073 --> 19:12.650
Six, seven times normal.

19:12.783 --> 19:14.656
- Life-threatening?
- No.

19:14.785 --> 19:16.065
What else?

19:16.203 --> 19:19.488
Well, it fits the bill of "mundane".
His skin looked jaundiced.

19:19.623 --> 19:21.580
Postmortem deoxygenation?

19:21.708 --> 19:24.994
Dead or alive, your vic's epidermis is yellow.

19:28.131 --> 19:30.171
- Tell me about his testicles.
- What?

19:32.886 --> 19:35.377
OK, I'm working with you. Er...

19:35.514 --> 19:37.222
I... I don't remember.

19:37.349 --> 19:40.469
I mean... genetics can be fascinating

19:40.602 --> 19:42.394
and there are things I take note of.

19:43.522 --> 19:45.230
But I didn't focus on his genitals.

19:46.858 --> 19:48.851
Thanks, doc.

19:50.237 --> 19:52.064
You're welcome.

19:52.197 --> 19:54.688
Let's cool off with a blast from the past

19:54.825 --> 19:57.031
Here's Chubby Checker and Limbo Rock

19:57.160 --> 19:58.489
<i>CHUBBY CHECKER: Limbo Rock</i>

19:58.620 --> 19:59.901
What are you guys doing?

20:00.038 --> 20:02.197
Waiting for an assignment.

20:02.332 --> 20:04.621
- You got a new case for us?
- A new case?

20:04.751 --> 20:07.752
We heard the Sheriff put the brakes
on the investigation.

20:07.879 --> 20:09.042
I didn't say that, did I?

20:10.924 --> 20:14.756
Well, I think I er...
smell something burning in the DNA Lab.

20:14.886 --> 20:17.971
- Love to stay and chat, but...
- Greg?

20:19.850 --> 20:21.926
I hope that's not the crossword puzzle.

20:22.060 --> 20:25.512
<i>Hey let's do the limbo rock!</i>
<i>Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-ha!</i>

20:25.647 --> 20:28.103
<i>Don't move that limbo bar!</i>

20:28.233 --> 20:31.400
<i>You'll be a limbo star</i>

20:31.528 --> 20:33.770
<i>How low can you go? </i>

20:33.905 --> 20:36.397
What about the nail
we pulled out of Valenti's boot?

20:36.533 --> 20:38.324
- Dusted?
- No, cos...

20:38.452 --> 20:40.907
Process the nail, please. If you get a print...

20:41.038 --> 20:43.493
I'll compare it to Bob Harris's ten card.

20:43.624 --> 20:45.331
Anything else?

20:45.459 --> 20:47.036
Yes. Metal cutters.

20:47.169 --> 20:51.083
I need you to prove or disprove whether
they were used to sever the grounding prong.

20:51.214 --> 20:52.294
OK.

20:54.509 --> 20:55.458
And you're with me.

20:55.594 --> 20:57.883
<i>VIVALDI: Winter from The Four Seasons</i>

21:15.155 --> 21:17.148
(Music builds)

21:29.920 --> 21:30.999
Mr Gesek!

21:33.924 --> 21:35.299
You're conducting.

21:37.469 --> 21:40.340
- I didn't hear you come in.
- Vivaldi. Four Seasons.

21:40.472 --> 21:42.512
Vivaldi, Valenti.

21:43.642 --> 21:46.180
Both Italians. It's like... being in Venice.

21:48.981 --> 21:51.353
Why are you here? Do I need a lawyer?

21:51.483 --> 21:53.310
Have you prepped him yet?

21:53.443 --> 21:56.231
I was about to commence draining
when I got distracted.

21:56.363 --> 21:58.819
Yeah, I know - Venice.
I need to see his testicles.

21:58.949 --> 22:00.988
I knew there was something weird about you.

22:01.118 --> 22:02.528
Excuse me!

22:02.661 --> 22:05.413
You can't just come in here
and look at my guy's goods.

22:05.539 --> 22:08.493
If I let you see him,
I have to let everybody see him.

22:09.626 --> 22:14.372
- But... perhaps we can work something out.
- What? Do you want us to pay to see him?

22:14.506 --> 22:16.712
That's a good idea, but no.

22:16.842 --> 22:20.341
I'm starting a business:
Crime Scene Cleanup. I'll want some referrals.

22:21.555 --> 22:23.547
I'll put you on a list.

22:27.561 --> 22:29.020
Testicular atrophy.

22:29.146 --> 22:30.604
They're the size of peas.

22:30.731 --> 22:32.308
Poor guy.

22:32.441 --> 22:35.691
Yeah, that's rough.
And the significance of this evidence?

22:35.819 --> 22:38.108
Haemochromatosis.

22:38.238 --> 22:41.239
Valenti had elevated levels of iron in his blood.

22:41.366 --> 22:43.608
Yellow pallor. Shrunken testicles.

22:43.744 --> 22:47.113
He's been ingesting trace amounts of iron
over a long period of time.

22:47.247 --> 22:48.706
Why'd he eat iron?

22:48.832 --> 22:52.201
Trace amounts are odourless, tasteless.
He probably didn't know.

22:52.336 --> 22:54.209
- You're saying he was poisoned?
- No.

22:54.338 --> 22:56.911
Iron molecules take a long time to build up.

22:57.049 --> 23:01.129
Could have been his diet, repeated blood
transfusions, excessive smoking.

23:01.261 --> 23:03.053
Possibly hereditary abnormalities.

23:03.180 --> 23:04.591
So, where does this get us?

23:04.723 --> 23:06.929
One step closer. Mr Gesek...

23:07.059 --> 23:09.929
Stick a syringe in his carotid,
all the way to his clavicle.

23:10.062 --> 23:11.770
You want his blood?

23:11.897 --> 23:13.605
One pint. To go.

23:20.155 --> 23:21.104
- Warrick.
- Hey.

23:21.239 --> 23:23.316
- I got a thumbprint off that nail.
- Cool.

23:23.450 --> 23:25.941
Only a partial. Print Lab's running a comparison.

23:26.078 --> 23:28.366
Whatever happened with those metal cutters?

23:28.497 --> 23:32.115
Serrations didn't match up.
They weren't used on the grounding prong.

23:32.250 --> 23:35.204
- What's in the envelope?
- Roger Valenti's blood.

23:35.337 --> 23:37.709
Grissom wants it packaged in plastic.

23:37.839 --> 23:39.037
I don't know. Don't ask.

23:40.175 --> 23:41.800
You want lunch?

23:41.927 --> 23:43.504
Later.

23:46.348 --> 23:47.628
- Hey, Catherine?
- Yeah.

23:47.766 --> 23:49.011
You ever been in therapy?

23:49.142 --> 23:50.850
Who hasn't?

23:50.978 --> 23:52.638
Didn't save my marriage.

23:52.771 --> 23:55.891
You were OK sharing your problems
with a complete stranger?

23:56.024 --> 23:57.483
You rather I tell them to you?

23:58.610 --> 24:00.069
Somebody order a warrant?

24:00.195 --> 24:02.900
- Yeah.
- Mustard and relish. Hold the onions.

24:03.031 --> 24:04.146
I hope it's a general.

24:04.283 --> 24:07.283
Epilepsy. Eyewitness physician dials 911.

24:07.411 --> 24:09.902
Coroner's quiet. You're lucky to get a limited.

24:10.038 --> 24:14.166
What do you mean? We've got fibres
on a 14-year-old and the shrink's clothing.

24:14.293 --> 24:15.917
Which would have got you nothing.

24:16.044 --> 24:19.460
But I did a check on the doctor.
She once had her licence suspended.

24:19.589 --> 24:24.335
Sex with a patient.
Teen's parents filed a complaint with the APA.

24:24.469 --> 24:28.597
Sex with a minor? Suspension's a joke.
She should have lost her licence, minimum.

24:28.724 --> 24:30.515
Yeah, well, this time maybe she will.

24:54.249 --> 24:55.827
OK, Gris.

24:58.003 --> 24:59.414
Valenti's blood.

24:59.546 --> 25:00.921
Packaged. Ready to go.

25:01.048 --> 25:02.328
Thank you.

25:06.261 --> 25:08.053
You wanna fill me in here? I mean...

25:08.180 --> 25:10.885
This wasn't covered in any science class I took.

25:11.016 --> 25:13.258
Well, iron is a conductive mineral.

25:14.436 --> 25:20.309
I wanna know if there was enough iron
in Valenti's blood... to conduct electricity.

25:20.442 --> 25:23.015
- That's far out
- Yeah, well...

25:23.153 --> 25:24.731
We'll see.

25:24.863 --> 25:26.654
Plug in the blood.

25:44.716 --> 25:47.883
Angora fibres?
What does that have to do with anything?

25:52.307 --> 25:55.474
Excuse me, I don't appreciate
being treated like a suspect.

25:55.602 --> 25:57.559
Then maybe you should wait outside.

25:57.688 --> 26:01.104
Do you consider me a suspect?
Because that's how I'm feeling.

26:04.861 --> 26:06.060
Fine

26:06.196 --> 26:08.272
Don't answer me. It's your choice.

26:08.407 --> 26:10.316
Funny thing about choices.

26:10.450 --> 26:13.202
Once you make 'em, you have to live with 'em.

26:15.372 --> 26:17.365
Dylan Buckley was just a boy.

26:20.127 --> 26:21.704
He trusted you.

26:21.837 --> 26:24.244
And you abused that trust.

26:25.966 --> 26:28.208
Linen closet. Top shelf.

26:28.343 --> 26:30.252
Was that blanket here?

26:30.387 --> 26:32.427
On the floor, with you and Dylan under it?

26:43.275 --> 26:45.267
It's gonna be OK.

26:45.402 --> 26:47.893
That's it. That's it.

26:48.030 --> 26:50.022
That's it. That's it.

26:51.742 --> 26:54.149
He was a 14-year-old kid

26:55.537 --> 26:57.031
What's the matter with you?

26:57.164 --> 27:00.497
He resisted. You persisted. Then what?

27:00.626 --> 27:04.575
I don't know the basis of your allegations,
but I have never crossed the line.

27:04.713 --> 27:06.456
That's not what your rap sheet says.

27:06.590 --> 27:07.870
Rap sheet?

27:08.008 --> 27:09.835
Sex with an underage patient.

27:09.968 --> 27:13.420
L-I was a resident. He was 1 T. We were in...

27:13.555 --> 27:17.968
Look, no criminal charges were filed.
It should have been expunged from my record.

27:18.101 --> 27:19.893
It doesn't make you any less guilty.

27:20.020 --> 27:21.598
Lady, I'm not a saint,

27:21.730 --> 27:24.850
but I am not a killer or a child molester.

27:26.026 --> 27:28.184
Dylan Buckley was an epileptic.

27:28.320 --> 27:30.728
He had a seizure. He hit his head.

27:30.864 --> 27:32.857
That's the truth.

27:32.991 --> 27:35.067
You don't like it? You can leave.

27:37.371 --> 27:39.031
We got what we came here for.

27:43.210 --> 27:45.701
- What's going on with you?
- I'm on a case.

27:45.837 --> 27:47.629
We're on a case.

27:47.756 --> 27:49.334
Right.

28:06.441 --> 28:07.936
Hey, is that from the deli?

28:08.068 --> 28:09.859
Egg salad sandwich. You want half?

28:09.987 --> 28:12.145
- No. Can I have your pickle?
- Yeah.

28:15.033 --> 28:16.741
You can have it.

28:17.953 --> 28:19.744
Oh, that's a nice one.

28:38.348 --> 28:40.341
You've turned my pickle into a light bulb.

28:40.475 --> 28:42.801
- I'm electrocuting it.
- You sure are.

28:42.936 --> 28:44.430
That would explain that smell.

28:44.563 --> 28:46.472
This is how I cooked hot dogs in college.

28:53.030 --> 28:55.022
Check out the burn mark s.

28:56.241 --> 28:57.819
There are none.

28:57.951 --> 29:01.285
Just like Valenti's body.
No evidence of electrocution.

29:01.413 --> 29:04.284
Pickles are high in sodium content.

29:04.416 --> 29:06.658
Sodium is conductive, just like iron.

29:06.793 --> 29:09.960
The flow of electricity through a body
generates heat.

29:17.679 --> 29:21.214
Burn marks are the physical evidence
of that. But...

29:21.350 --> 29:25.098
if the body offers no resistance
to the flow of electricity -

29:25.228 --> 29:27.221
no heat, no burn mark s.

29:27.356 --> 29:31.982
Roger Valenti's body offered up no resistance
because of the excess iron in his blood.

29:32.110 --> 29:33.688
It conducted electricity

29:33.820 --> 29:37.604
Making his body one big wire. Path to ground.

29:37.741 --> 29:41.359
In through his hand from the drill,
out through the nail in the boot.

29:41.495 --> 29:44.615
No burn mark s... but he was still electrocuted.

30:02.975 --> 30:04.718
So you've just proved murder.

30:06.103 --> 30:08.594
I wouldn't break out that champagne just yet.

30:08.730 --> 30:12.230
Don't go shooting the messenger.
Thumbprint from the nail.

30:15.279 --> 30:18.114
Bob Harris's prints were not
on the murder weapon?

30:18.240 --> 30:19.568
They were not on the nail.

30:19.700 --> 30:23.993
I think someone stuck a nail in the victim's boot
and it wasn't Bob Harris.

30:24.121 --> 30:26.446
So you made a suspect out of an innocent man.

30:26.581 --> 30:28.455
Obviously that wasn't my intent.

30:28.583 --> 30:32.332
Oh, good. Maybe you'll wanna bring that up
in the newspaper article.

30:32.462 --> 30:34.953
What are you talking about? What article?

30:35.090 --> 30:38.210
The one I'm arranging for your public apology.

30:38.343 --> 30:40.881
- I'm not making an apology.
- Oh, yes, you are.

30:41.013 --> 30:46.553
You don't go after a friend of mine,
sully his reputation and then walk away.

30:46.685 --> 30:49.141
Actions have consequences, Gil. Even yours.

31:07.581 --> 31:09.739
I heard the Sheriff chewed you a new one.

31:09.875 --> 31:13.078
- You get my message?
- You want me to check out your Deep Throat.

31:13.211 --> 31:14.492
(Printer beeps)

31:15.714 --> 31:17.707
Well, that was fast.

31:17.841 --> 31:20.842
Ian Wolf. Union of Electrical Workers, Local 3T.

31:20.969 --> 31:25.715
He wanted to make sure that I stayed on Harris
for the murder of Roger Valenti.

31:25.849 --> 31:29.183
- Doesn't that tell you something?
- I told him to talk to you.

31:29.311 --> 31:31.102
I'll check out the guy.

31:31.855 --> 31:33.433
(Sighs)

31:33.565 --> 31:35.558
Gil, why do you do this to yourself?

31:35.692 --> 31:37.519
- What?
- The guy's dead

31:37.653 --> 31:40.144
Could have been suicide. Accident.

31:40.280 --> 31:41.940
You always gotta push it.

31:42.074 --> 31:43.947
It's just like any other case.

31:44.076 --> 31:45.534
You know what I think?

31:45.661 --> 31:46.906
Adrenaline.

31:47.037 --> 31:49.493
You need the rush

31:49.623 --> 31:51.865
But that's just me.

32:48.557 --> 32:50.549
OK. Thank you, David.

32:50.684 --> 32:52.143
No sweat.

32:52.269 --> 32:55.186
Hey, he asked for it.

32:55.314 --> 32:58.433
How many swabs does it take
to process a blanket?

32:58.567 --> 32:59.563
I'm thorough.

32:59.693 --> 33:02.860
The lab tested Dylan Buckley's blood
for creatine kinase

33:02.988 --> 33:04.981
which would be elevated post-seizure.

33:05.115 --> 33:07.191
But Dylan Buckley's levels were normal.

33:07.326 --> 33:09.402
I just got my own copy of the report.

33:10.537 --> 33:11.782
Dr Sapien lied.

33:12.914 --> 33:16.034
You're racing me, Nick.
We're driving the same car.

33:16.168 --> 33:18.077
Nick!

33:19.212 --> 33:21.964
Nick, I'll have you removed from the case.

33:27.054 --> 33:30.553
You're confronting suspects
before the evidence is processed.

33:30.682 --> 33:32.675
You're flying solo, cutting me out.

33:34.227 --> 33:35.508
What's going on?

33:37.314 --> 33:38.892
OK.

33:40.651 --> 33:44.399
There are some people
you're supposed to be able to trust, you know.

33:47.866 --> 33:51.531
I was nine
and she was a last-minute baby-sitter.

33:54.414 --> 33:58.792
All I can remember doing afterwards
is sitting in my room in the dark,

33:58.919 --> 34:02.418
staring at the door,
waiting for my... mom to get home.

34:07.177 --> 34:09.170
I've never told anyone before.

34:15.811 --> 34:17.388
I'm sorry.

34:18.605 --> 34:20.514
It's what makes a person, I guess.

34:23.485 --> 34:25.228
I'm sorry, Catherine.

34:30.574 --> 34:34.786
Check me out. So what? The worst thing
I've done is get a speeding ticket.

34:34.913 --> 34:37.784
And take a pipe to Valenti's head
four days before he died.

34:37.916 --> 34:41.534
It wasn't on the foreman's report.
Valenti's widow told me.

34:41.670 --> 34:43.460
Guys get in beefs all the time

34:43.588 --> 34:46.257
But he died
Harris had nothing to do with it

34:46.382 --> 34:48.839
Despite your efforts to make it seem that way.

34:48.969 --> 34:52.717
Look, I'm not saying another word
till I talk to a union lawyer.

34:52.848 --> 34:55.683
I pay my dues and these guys play hardball.

35:03.525 --> 35:04.640
He's guilty.

35:04.776 --> 35:07.267
Let's not make the same mistake twice.

35:08.530 --> 35:12.444
30 swabs in six hours?
Not realistic, all right? Even for me.

35:12.576 --> 35:15.945
I thought you'd like the challenge.
What are we looking at here?

35:16.079 --> 35:19.579
Lots of epithelials.
There were skin cells shed all over the blanket.

35:19.708 --> 35:21.701
Dylan Buckley's. Dr Sapien's.

35:21.835 --> 35:23.460
You're two-thirds of the way there.

35:23.587 --> 35:27.501
I also isolated a set of cells
from another individual. Identity unknown.

35:30.052 --> 35:32.721
But, when it's important to Nick here,
I push further.

35:32.804 --> 35:35.093
T of the 13 markers match your dead kid.

35:36.683 --> 35:37.928
Familial DNA?

35:38.060 --> 35:39.969
Father's dead. Means we're looking at mom.

35:40.103 --> 35:44.053
A naked kid under a blanket at a shrink's
late at night... and his mother's there.

35:44.191 --> 35:47.192
Your case just entered
a whole new dimension of weird.

35:56.703 --> 35:59.373
- Where's Mandy?
- Cross-eyed from running our partial.

35:59.456 --> 36:01.994
I didn't wanna lose any time so I took over.

36:02.125 --> 36:04.414
The database is T0,000.

36:04.544 --> 36:06.786
- It could take a while
- If I narrow the scope?

36:06.922 --> 36:08.630
- To one.
- We got a suspect?

36:08.757 --> 36:12.173
Ian Wolf. Like the animal, not the authors.

36:23.522 --> 36:27.650
Partial overlay - perfect match.
Now we just gotta place him at the crime scene.

36:27.776 --> 36:31.441
Warrick's on it. I got a warrant for his tool belt.
Metal cutters included.

36:36.368 --> 36:38.159
(Door opens)

36:39.621 --> 36:43.571
Doc? The kid in his underwear -
tell us about the Y-incision.

36:43.709 --> 36:45.500
Leftovers from my anniversary dinner.

36:45.627 --> 36:47.205
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

36:47.337 --> 36:50.955
The same tan fibres I found on the outside
I found on the inside.

36:51.091 --> 36:54.377
Mouth, nasal passages, both lungs.

36:54.511 --> 36:57.263
- He was wrapped in that blanket.
- Mm-hm. Head to toe.

37:03.604 --> 37:06.973
Mrs Buckley, we know that your son
didn't have a seizure.

37:07.107 --> 37:10.025
We also know that you were
at Dr Sapien's house with Dylan

37:10.152 --> 37:11.776
the night that he died

37:11.903 --> 37:14.988
He was in his underwear,
wrapped in a blanket,

37:15.115 --> 37:17.108
fighting for every breath.

37:17.242 --> 37:18.820
I loved my son.

37:20.037 --> 37:21.863
That's what every parent says.

37:23.081 --> 37:24.789
This...

37:24.916 --> 37:28.036
This was therapy. I had tried everything else.

37:28.170 --> 37:32.037
Taken him to so many specialists,
but I couldn't reach him.

37:32.174 --> 37:33.668
So we...

37:33.800 --> 37:35.259
We tried the...

37:35.385 --> 37:37.461
(Sighs) We

37:41.642 --> 37:43.765
I have to tell them.

37:47.064 --> 37:49.103
It's called rebirthing.

37:50.275 --> 37:51.734
Rebirthing?

37:51.860 --> 37:55.525
It's a technique used to treat
extreme behavioural disorders.

37:55.656 --> 37:58.775
The idea is to turn back the clock,
wipe the slate clean.

37:58.909 --> 38:01.115
Allow the child to re-bond with his mother.

38:01.244 --> 38:02.739
What is the blanket for?

38:02.871 --> 38:04.282
It represents the birth canal.

38:07.125 --> 38:08.952
So you wrapped Dylan up...

38:10.796 --> 38:12.835
beat the hell out of him and...

38:12.965 --> 38:16.215
hocus-pocus, he's supposed to love you again?

38:16.343 --> 38:21.503
Rebirthing may not be a recognised
therapeutic procedure, but it's not illegal.

38:21.640 --> 38:23.549
Last time I checked, murder is.

38:23.684 --> 38:25.392
I begged her to do it.

38:25.519 --> 38:27.428
All other methods of therapy had failed.

38:27.562 --> 38:30.766
Dylan was becoming more belligerent,
withdrawn. Even dangerous.

38:30.899 --> 38:34.434
I just wanted my son to love me. That's all.

38:34.569 --> 38:36.858
- Dylan was a willing participant.
- He was 14.

38:37.990 --> 38:41.405
I instructed Dylan to lie down
on the floor

38:41.535 --> 38:43.112
in the foetal position

38:43.245 --> 38:44.905
As part of the process,

38:45.038 --> 38:48.739
I asked him if he wanted to be reborn
to his mother. He said yes.

38:48.875 --> 38:51.201
Now we're going to close the womb.

38:53.672 --> 38:55.961
Twist.

38:56.091 --> 38:58.214
So, then what happened?

38:59.344 --> 39:01.384
Things got out of hand? He changed his mind?

39:01.513 --> 39:04.549
Somewhere in the middle
of an angora birth canal?

39:04.683 --> 39:06.391
It is time to be reborn.

39:07.644 --> 39:10.314
That's it. Push harder. Push harder!

39:10.397 --> 39:12.224
- Try to get out.
- (Fights for breath)

39:12.357 --> 39:14.813
A little harder. Come on, Dylan.

39:14.943 --> 39:16.936
I can't breathe. I'm gonna die!

39:17.070 --> 39:20.486
Do you wanna be reborn
or do you wanna stay in there and die?

39:20.616 --> 39:23.782
Let me outta here, please.
Mom, please! I want this to stop!

39:23.910 --> 39:26.947
- Maybe we should.
- No. This is what happens. We can't stop now.

39:27.080 --> 39:29.571
Trust me. This is a normal response.

39:30.792 --> 39:33.959
- I thought it was part of the process.
- It is.

39:34.087 --> 39:36.413
She said that that's what
he was supposed to say.

39:36.548 --> 39:41.127
That babies don't want to come out.
That's why it's such an ordeal for the woman.

39:46.016 --> 39:48.685
So, you pushed on him,
like a mother in labour?

39:48.769 --> 39:51.770
Come on! Push harder!

39:51.897 --> 39:53.557
Stop it! I can't breathe!

39:54.608 --> 39:56.268
Push harder!

39:56.401 --> 39:57.896
That's it!

40:02.282 --> 40:03.860
(Panting) OK.

40:07.955 --> 40:09.746
Honey?

40:09.873 --> 40:12.115
Dylan? Honey?

40:16.296 --> 40:19.499
When we opened the blanket,
his eyes were closed.

40:20.634 --> 40:22.673
I thought he was pretending to be asleep.

40:29.017 --> 40:31.508
So much for your... therapy.

40:36.441 --> 40:38.019
Excuse me.

40:45.993 --> 40:50.121
And that's why we tried to hide it.
We knew you wouldn't understand.

41:06.430 --> 41:08.553
The twin moons of Venus

41:08.682 --> 41:10.141
Overlap to one.

41:12.686 --> 41:14.560
The striations match

41:14.688 --> 41:16.811
Wolf stuck a nail in Valenti's boot

41:16.940 --> 41:20.523
compromised the drill, and cut
the grounding prong with his own cutters.

41:20.652 --> 41:23.855
- That seems like a lot of work to kill a guy.
- Not for an electrician.

41:23.989 --> 41:25.234
I'm gonna find Brass.

41:25.365 --> 41:26.528
Hey, Gris...

41:26.658 --> 41:30.158
I think I can speak for both of us
when I say I'm sorry that we let you down.

41:30.287 --> 41:34.035
- We quit before we should have.
- Yeah. You did.

41:39.129 --> 41:41.205
(Workmen shout)

41:46.720 --> 41:48.298
Mr Wolf!

41:49.473 --> 41:51.015
We got you for murder

41:51.141 --> 41:53.050
Premeditated.

41:53.185 --> 41:54.644
You know this from my cutters?

41:54.770 --> 41:56.727
They're just part of the story.

42:00.150 --> 42:04.278
You spiked Roger's boot with a nail
compromised the insulation

42:04.404 --> 42:07.239
You reversed the polarity in his drill.

42:07.366 --> 42:09.857
You cut the grounding prong

42:09.993 --> 42:11.653
planted evidence

42:11.787 --> 42:13.495
And killed a man.

42:27.427 --> 42:29.254
You're under arrest.

42:37.938 --> 42:39.729
Grissom!

42:42.234 --> 42:43.858
It's all you, man.

42:45.862 --> 42:47.522
Thank you.

42:48.740 --> 42:50.235
Sheriff.

42:50.367 --> 42:52.490
Well, you got the bad apple.

42:52.619 --> 42:54.113
Yeah. How about that?

42:54.246 --> 42:57.033
Just in time for my big public apology.

42:57.165 --> 42:59.835
I may be changing the tenor
of that piece somewhat.

42:59.960 --> 43:03.625
You won't be the goat,
but you won't be the hero, either.

43:04.840 --> 43:06.797
Good. I'll leave that to you.

43:06.925 --> 43:09.416
That's why we will continue
to work well together.

43:12.097 --> 43:14.090
Grissom.
