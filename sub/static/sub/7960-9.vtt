WEBVTT

00:04.315 --> 00:06.185
Thank you.

00:06.775 --> 00:09.314
Pretty bold choice not
tipping that barista.

00:09.315 --> 00:11.354
Okay, I'm sorry,
I tip for good service,

00:11.355 --> 00:12.854
and in what world
does it take 20 minutes

00:12.855 --> 00:14.315
to make a simple cup of coffee?

00:15.815 --> 00:18.184
Holy moly, that is good.

00:18.185 --> 00:19.394
I told you he was an artist.

00:19.395 --> 00:20.524
Look what he wrote in the foam.

00:20.525 --> 00:22.314
"Thank you for your patience."

00:22.315 --> 00:23.814
Well, I'm a horrible
human being.

00:23.815 --> 00:26.234
No, you're not, honey.

00:26.235 --> 00:27.684
You're just cheap.

00:27.685 --> 00:30.064
I'm not cheap.

00:30.065 --> 00:31.484
You know what?
Watch this.

00:31.485 --> 00:32.644
Hello there!

00:32.645 --> 00:33.774
A little something for...

00:33.775 --> 00:36.184
Oh, you know what?
That's actually a 20.

00:36.185 --> 00:37.564
She thought it was a single.

00:37.565 --> 00:39.234
No, I thought it was a five.

00:39.235 --> 00:41.184
Which is so very generous,
but, um...

00:41.185 --> 00:44.734
Okay, well,
that's a $20 for you.

00:44.735 --> 00:46.234
And you owe me 15 bucks.

00:46.235 --> 00:47.485
Ms. Flynn?

00:48.525 --> 00:49.524
Yeah.

00:49.525 --> 00:51.354
Do I know you?

00:51.355 --> 00:52.604
Oh, my God.

00:52.605 --> 00:54.184
Yeah, you were
my favorite teacher.

00:54.185 --> 00:57.354
Oh, that is so sweet.

00:57.355 --> 00:58.354
You don't know who I am.

00:58.355 --> 01:00.314
Not a clue.

01:00.315 --> 01:01.444
It's okay.

01:01.445 --> 01:04.354
Uh, last time you saw me,
I was ten years old,

01:04.355 --> 01:06.444
uh, I had no front teeth,
and I had a pirate patch

01:06.445 --> 01:07.945
to cover my lazy eye.

01:09.235 --> 01:10.984
Frannie DuVall!

01:10.985 --> 01:12.484
Yeah. Present.

01:12.485 --> 01:14.185
Oh, of course I remember you.

01:16.025 --> 01:17.945
I don't remember that.

01:19.355 --> 01:21.064
Sweetie, I wouldn't
cover that up with a sign.

01:21.065 --> 01:22.645
You'd make a lot more money.

01:24.815 --> 01:26.734
When did you...
or, you know, how did you...

01:26.735 --> 01:30.064
I mean, not how.
I know... I know how.

01:30.065 --> 01:31.564
Um... hey.

01:31.565 --> 01:33.394
We were just talking about
grabbing a-a bite to eat.

01:33.395 --> 01:35.274
Would you... would you
like to come with us?

01:35.275 --> 01:36.274
We just ate.

01:36.275 --> 01:37.605
We're gonna eat again.

01:39.355 --> 01:40.644
What do you say, you in?

01:40.645 --> 01:43.234
Yeah, that... that would
be great actually.

01:43.235 --> 01:44.234
Okay.

01:44.235 --> 01:45.774
Well, maybe we could
get a cocktail, too.

01:45.775 --> 01:47.184
Victoria, she's, like, 17.

01:47.185 --> 01:49.274
Well, they're not gonna
card a pregnant girl.

01:49.275 --> 01:50.234
Come on, sweetie.

01:50.235 --> 01:52.275
Let's grab all
your filthy stuff.

02:23.757 --> 02:25.756
I don't know if you
hung out with those hobos

02:25.757 --> 02:27.666
under that bridge on Cicero,
but last Christmas,

02:27.667 --> 02:31.336
I was the guy who left a bag
of Whopper Jr.'s under there,

02:31.337 --> 02:32.877
so, you know...

02:34.957 --> 02:36.667
...you're welcome.

02:38.047 --> 02:39.836
Vince, she's our guest.

02:39.837 --> 02:41.706
Don't talk to her.

02:41.707 --> 02:43.086
There you go.

02:43.087 --> 02:44.166
Okay, turkey sandwich.

02:44.167 --> 02:45.376
I almost made you a PB and J,

02:45.377 --> 02:47.256
but then I remembered
you had a nut allergy.

02:47.257 --> 02:48.496
You have a good memory.

02:48.497 --> 02:50.547
Well, you were my first EpiPen.

02:51.877 --> 02:54.086
And my second.

02:54.087 --> 02:56.206
And I'm so sorry
about those walnut brownies,

02:56.207 --> 02:57.756
but, in my defense,

02:57.757 --> 02:59.546
you shouldn't have
called it a "peanut allergy"

02:59.547 --> 03:02.836
if it included
the entire nut family.

03:02.837 --> 03:04.956
So, when's your baby due,
Frannie?

03:04.957 --> 03:06.046
Uh, they said at the clinic

03:06.047 --> 03:07.296
something like
six weeks from now.

03:07.297 --> 03:09.497
Wow! That's coming up
in about...

03:10.627 --> 03:11.877
Six weeks.

03:13.837 --> 03:16.376
Oh, kid, it's got to be rough
out there on those streets.

03:16.377 --> 03:18.336
Wh-what do you use
for protection?

03:18.337 --> 03:20.904
Mom, she obviously
didn't use protection.

03:22.497 --> 03:24.496
I'm sorry for her ignorance.

03:24.497 --> 03:26.126
I'm just saying,

03:26.127 --> 03:29.336
I don't leave the house without
a steak knife in my purse.

03:29.337 --> 03:32.416
You try to rob me,
or talk in a movie theater,

03:32.417 --> 03:33.667
you're gonna see the blade.

03:37.047 --> 03:40.627
I just hope your throat doesn't
close up around all these nuts.

03:42.207 --> 03:44.087
Uh, so...

03:46.167 --> 03:47.756
How's a kid like you
survive out there?

03:47.757 --> 03:49.336
I do what I got to do.

03:49.337 --> 03:50.586
Um, some days I make
enough money off

03:50.587 --> 03:53.206
of what people give me,
and sometimes

03:53.207 --> 03:55.756
I got to get a little
more... creative.

03:55.757 --> 04:00.626
Mm, like, uh,
Mary Magdalene creative?

04:00.627 --> 04:02.547
Ew! Mom!

04:04.707 --> 04:08.586
And by "ew," I mean
no one's judging you.

04:08.587 --> 04:12.126
Yeah... no, I meant more like
"stealing" creative.

04:12.127 --> 04:16.047
Okay, thank God, 'cause I was...
I was judging you a little bit.

04:17.087 --> 04:18.416
I'm-I'm not proud of it,

04:18.416 --> 04:20.836
but I've shoplifted
and stuff like that.

04:20.837 --> 04:22.086
You know, you would be surprised

04:22.087 --> 04:24.257
how often people leave
their cars unlocked.

04:30.377 --> 04:31.376
Hey, how's it going?

04:31.377 --> 04:32.626
Hey, honey.

04:32.627 --> 04:34.666
Uh, this is Frannie.

04:34.667 --> 04:36.086
Former student of mine.

04:36.087 --> 04:37.496
- She's homeless.
- And pregnant.

04:37.497 --> 04:39.837
And she's telling us
how she robs cars.

04:41.000 --> 04:47.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:53.047 --> 04:54.376
All right.

04:54.377 --> 04:56.796
I got Frannie all
set up on the couch.

04:56.797 --> 04:58.496
You sure we can trust her
down there alone?

04:58.497 --> 05:00.876
She's not gonna steal anything.

05:00.877 --> 05:02.296
And if she does, you've been
looking for a reason

05:02.297 --> 05:03.916
to buy a new TV.

05:03.917 --> 05:05.296
Well, if that's the case,

05:05.297 --> 05:06.796
we can throw in the microwave,

05:06.797 --> 05:09.376
I'll drive her
to the pawn shop myself.

05:09.377 --> 05:12.206
She's a sweet kid
in a tough spot.

05:12.207 --> 05:13.836
I couldn't just walk away.

05:13.837 --> 05:15.876
I mean, I'm her
favorite teacher.

05:15.877 --> 05:17.706
Her words, not mine.

05:17.707 --> 05:19.376
Everybody loves fourth grade.

05:19.377 --> 05:21.916
- They don't teach you the hard stuff yet.
- Really?

05:21.917 --> 05:23.256
State capitals?

05:23.257 --> 05:24.496
Times tables?

05:24.497 --> 05:26.167
That is core knowledge, baby.

05:26.957 --> 05:28.496
What about her parents?

05:28.497 --> 05:30.376
I mean,
do they even know where she's at?

05:30.377 --> 05:32.586
Frannie said they kicked
her out of the house.

05:32.587 --> 05:34.376
I mean, they basically
just wrote her off.

05:34.377 --> 05:36.706
Okay, but do we know
that actually happened?

05:36.707 --> 05:39.166
I mean, you're taking the word
of an admitted criminal.

05:39.167 --> 05:40.796
A criminal? Really?

05:40.797 --> 05:42.166
She shoplifted a few times.

05:42.167 --> 05:44.206
You're always eating grapes
at the grocery store.

05:44.207 --> 05:46.996
I sample.
That's different.

05:46.997 --> 05:49.126
Really? You ever pay
for those afterwards?

05:49.127 --> 05:52.626
Not if they don't
meet my standards.

05:52.627 --> 05:54.296
Besides, it doesn't matter
what happened

05:54.297 --> 05:55.336
between her and her parents.

05:55.337 --> 05:56.876
I mean, put yourself
in their shoes.

05:56.877 --> 05:58.996
If your daughter
was living on the street...

05:58.997 --> 06:00.376
alone,

06:00.377 --> 06:03.046
wouldn't you want somebody
to bring her home to you?

06:03.047 --> 06:04.836
Yes.

06:04.837 --> 06:06.337
Because?

06:07.377 --> 06:09.336
Because I'd be
worried sick about her.

06:09.337 --> 06:11.167
Exactly.

06:12.667 --> 06:14.627
Wait a minute,
did I just win an argument?

06:15.587 --> 06:18.417
I think you did.
Aw, good for you.

06:23.337 --> 06:25.376
Um, okay, South Dakota?

06:25.377 --> 06:26.836
- Pierre.
- Ooh.

06:26.837 --> 06:28.166
- Seven times eight?
- 56.

06:28.167 --> 06:30.206
God, I was good.

06:30.207 --> 06:31.756
Yeah, you really were.

06:31.757 --> 06:33.666
I still remember when those kids

06:33.667 --> 06:36.256
were making fun
of my lazy eye patch.

06:36.257 --> 06:38.756
You stuck up for me.
You wore one for a whole week.

06:38.757 --> 06:40.626
Oh, it really was
just a happy accident.

06:40.627 --> 06:41.997
I-I had pinkeye.

06:43.207 --> 06:45.456
Fourth graders are filthy.

06:45.457 --> 06:49.166
Either way, it kept them off
my back till Larry Bean got lice.

06:49.167 --> 06:50.546
Oof.

06:50.547 --> 06:52.956
I want to shave my head
for that kid.

06:52.957 --> 06:55.376
You were-you were great through.

06:55.377 --> 06:56.376
Hmm.

06:56.377 --> 06:57.626
Always doing extra credit.

06:57.627 --> 07:00.126
Staying after school to help me.

07:00.127 --> 07:03.046
'Cause I didn't want to go home.

07:03.047 --> 07:04.376
Look, and I still don't.
I'm telling you

07:04.377 --> 07:06.256
this is a waste of time.

07:06.257 --> 07:07.256
Okay, I know you think it is,

07:07.257 --> 07:08.836
but if-if you were my daughter,

07:08.837 --> 07:11.376
I would want to know that you
and that baby were safe.

07:11.377 --> 07:13.456
Yeah, well,
if you were my mother,

07:13.457 --> 07:16.416
I probably would've
told you I was pregnant.

07:16.417 --> 07:17.796
They don't know?

07:17.797 --> 07:19.296
- Okay, they're super religious.
- Oh, my God.

07:19.297 --> 07:20.456
No, they're the kind of people

07:20.457 --> 07:22.336
that think that dancing
will lead to pregnancy.

07:22.337 --> 07:23.336
- Well...
- Okay.

07:23.337 --> 07:25.336
One time they were right.

07:25.337 --> 07:27.256
You know, people could change.
I did, you know?

07:27.257 --> 07:30.166
When I was a kid, I got
into all kinds of trouble.

07:30.167 --> 07:33.456
Double-pierced my ears
without permission.

07:33.457 --> 07:35.296
TP'ed a house.

07:35.297 --> 07:37.086
Went back to clean it up.
Got caught.

07:37.087 --> 07:39.546
Cried my way out of it.

07:39.547 --> 07:42.047
Whoa, pretty bad-ass.

07:43.167 --> 07:45.206
My point is that,

07:45.207 --> 07:47.496
you know, everybody
deserves a second chance,

07:47.497 --> 07:49.666
even your parents.

07:52.667 --> 07:54.837
You ready?

07:55.877 --> 07:57.297
No.

08:00.127 --> 08:02.496
All right.

08:02.497 --> 08:04.876
You sit tight here,
I'll go in first,

08:04.877 --> 08:06.166
I'll talk to them,

08:06.167 --> 08:08.496
I'll work a little bit of
my Ms. Flynn magic.

08:08.497 --> 08:10.376
I have a feeling they're
not quite the monsters

08:10.377 --> 08:11.997
that you think they are.

08:16.497 --> 08:18.756
So, those people are monsters.

08:18.757 --> 08:20.996
Yeah, I told you.

08:20.997 --> 08:23.666
Just so much worse
than you even said.

08:23.667 --> 08:26.376
I mean, I-I tried explaining
your situation to your mother

08:26.377 --> 08:29.166
and she just shouted,
: "I rebuke thee!"

08:29.167 --> 08:30.756
And, I mean, that... it was...

08:30.757 --> 08:32.256
I'm not even doing it justice.

08:32.256 --> 08:34.376
It came from a real deep place.

08:34.376 --> 08:37.376
And then your dad starting
splashing me with his Fresca,

08:37.376 --> 08:40.046
I mean, like it was holy water.

08:40.047 --> 08:42.706
Home sweet home.

08:42.707 --> 08:45.336
Okay, living there
is not an option.

08:45.337 --> 08:46.956
So, you're gonna
come home with me

08:46.957 --> 08:48.626
and you can stay there
until we figure this out.

08:48.627 --> 08:51.046
God, no, no, you-you
don't have to do that.

08:51.047 --> 08:52.626
Well, I certainly am not gonna
put you out on the street

08:52.627 --> 08:54.046
to raise a baby.

08:54.047 --> 08:56.206
Oh, I'm-I'm not
keeping the baby.

08:56.207 --> 08:57.836
I'm giving it up.

08:57.837 --> 09:01.046
- Oh.
- Yeah.

09:01.047 --> 09:04.166
Look at me,
I... I can't raise a kid.

09:04.167 --> 09:06.376
I want it to have a safe home,

09:06.377 --> 09:08.336
and a chance at a good life.

09:08.337 --> 09:10.837
I can't give it all that.

09:12.297 --> 09:15.256
- Look, you probably think I'm a horrible...
- I'll take it!

09:15.257 --> 09:16.916
I'll take that baby.

09:33.232 --> 09:34.231
Hey.

09:34.232 --> 09:35.821
Hey.

09:35.822 --> 09:38.321
I thought, uh, Molly was
taking you back to your folks.

09:38.322 --> 09:41.151
Uh... yeah, it, uh,
it didn't work out.

09:41.152 --> 09:43.611
So where is everybody?

09:43.612 --> 09:45.901
Uh, Ms. Flynn is upstairs,

09:45.902 --> 09:47.821
redhead lady and bald guy
are at a casino,

09:47.822 --> 09:49.281
and stoned chick
when into the backyard

09:49.282 --> 09:50.782
with a lighter and an apple.

09:53.482 --> 09:55.521
You're a cop,
you could probably, like,

09:55.522 --> 09:57.572
put that together.

09:59.022 --> 10:01.321
Making yourself at home?

10:01.322 --> 10:02.401
Yeah, I am.

10:02.402 --> 10:04.941
Well, just so you know
how things work around here,

10:04.942 --> 10:09.402
everybody has their own box of
cereal and you are eating mine.

10:10.902 --> 10:13.231
This was the only one
that doesn't say,

10:13.232 --> 10:16.232
"For healthy stools"
on the front.

10:17.902 --> 10:20.231
Yeah, I know, that's why
I wrote my name on the box.

10:20.232 --> 10:22.442
See, Trix are for Mike.

10:24.612 --> 10:26.361
Look, let's, uh,
let's cut to the chase

10:26.362 --> 10:28.821
about you staying here, okay?

10:28.822 --> 10:33.281
Molly is a nice person.
Probably too nice.

10:33.282 --> 10:35.191
Me? I'm not so nice.

10:35.192 --> 10:36.692
Dude, it's just cereal.

10:38.692 --> 10:40.731
Okay, "dude,"
it's not about that.

10:40.732 --> 10:43.571
See, I'm a cop,
so I've seen it all, okay?

10:43.572 --> 10:45.151
So, it's a little hard for me

10:45.152 --> 10:47.361
to buy this whole "poor little
pregnant girl" routine.

10:47.362 --> 10:50.231
There's nothing to buy.
That's literally what I am.

10:50.232 --> 10:53.902
Just so you know
I got my eye on you.

10:55.192 --> 10:56.361
If you're trying to scare me,

10:56.362 --> 10:58.441
you might want to wipe
that dribble of pink milk

10:58.442 --> 11:01.151
off your chin.

11:01.152 --> 11:03.022
Nobody likes a smart-ass.

11:05.232 --> 11:06.862
- Did I get it?
- Yeah.

11:08.782 --> 11:11.281
You know, uh, this city
has a lot of great programs

11:11.282 --> 11:14.111
for kids in your, uh...
situation.

11:14.112 --> 11:15.731
I could set you up
at a really nice place.

11:15.732 --> 11:17.401
It would take care of you
and your baby.

11:17.402 --> 11:18.731
I'm good.

11:18.732 --> 11:20.901
I already found a family
that's gonna take the baby.

11:20.902 --> 11:22.191
Really? That's great!

11:22.192 --> 11:23.191
When did this happen?

11:23.192 --> 11:25.021
Today, actually.

11:25.022 --> 11:26.321
- They seem pretty cool.
- Mm.

11:26.322 --> 11:28.322
Uh, well, the wife.

11:31.022 --> 11:34.361
The husband is kind of a dork.

11:34.362 --> 11:37.691
Hey, that's the man who's gonna
adopt your child,

11:37.692 --> 11:39.152
show a little respect.

11:40.362 --> 11:41.862
Yeah, you're right.
I should.

11:42.942 --> 11:44.282
Another dribble.

11:45.232 --> 11:46.281
You know what?

11:46.282 --> 11:47.802
I think something's up
with this spoon.

11:58.282 --> 11:59.191
Hey, hon.

11:59.192 --> 12:01.981
So glad you're home,
I got big news for you.

12:01.982 --> 12:04.111
Oh, I know, uh,
Frannie already told me.

12:04.112 --> 12:05.281
She did?

12:05.282 --> 12:07.321
Dang it, I wanted to see
the look on your face

12:07.322 --> 12:08.981
when you first found out.

12:08.982 --> 12:10.231
It was a lot like this,

12:10.232 --> 12:13.021
except, uh, there was,
uh, some milk dribble.

12:13.022 --> 12:15.781
You seem really calm about this.

12:15.782 --> 12:17.861
What's the big deal?
I mean, I think it's great,

12:17.862 --> 12:20.442
but I don't see how
it's gonna change our lives.

12:22.282 --> 12:24.151
Okay, um...

12:24.152 --> 12:26.361
what exactly did she tell you?

12:26.362 --> 12:28.191
Uh, she said
she found some couple

12:28.192 --> 12:29.362
that was gonna take the baby.

12:32.192 --> 12:34.111
- No.
- Yes.

12:34.112 --> 12:35.321
- No.
- Yes.

12:35.322 --> 12:37.781
- No, no, no, no, Molly!
- Yes! Yes, yes!

12:37.782 --> 12:40.441
Why would you do this
without talking to me?

12:40.442 --> 12:43.021
Well, I know it seems crazy,
but it all happened so fast,

12:43.022 --> 12:44.191
and I wanted to snatch it up

12:44.192 --> 12:46.071
before somebody else
got to it first.

12:46.072 --> 12:49.522
It's not a door buster
at Wal-Mart, it's a baby!

12:51.112 --> 12:54.191
I know that, but you know how
long we've been wanting this.

12:54.192 --> 12:56.781
And then suddenly Frannie just
shows up on our doorstep?

12:56.782 --> 12:58.441
Mike, this is fate.

12:58.442 --> 13:00.861
No, it's a combination
of bad parenting,

13:00.862 --> 13:03.231
poor choices, and you
not having change for a 20.

13:03.232 --> 13:04.941
Yes. Boom. Fate.

13:06.362 --> 13:07.611
Look, you're not
thinking this through.

13:07.612 --> 13:10.281
I'm telling you,
this is a bad idea.

13:10.282 --> 13:13.861
Okay, uh, what happened
to my baby-crazy husband?

13:13.862 --> 13:15.481
I mean, you were telling me
favorite boy names

13:15.482 --> 13:16.781
by our third date.

13:16.782 --> 13:20.441
And I want to have a little
Jordan Pippin Biggs,

13:20.442 --> 13:22.231
but I want it to be our baby.

13:22.232 --> 13:23.731
Together.

13:23.732 --> 13:26.151
Well, what difference does it
make where it comes from?

13:26.152 --> 13:27.941
Do we know anything
about the father?

13:27.942 --> 13:29.361
Do either one of them
have a drug history?

13:29.362 --> 13:31.781
And what about her?
She's an admitted petty criminal.

13:31.782 --> 13:34.691
Oh, Mike, come on,
we all have a dark past.

13:34.692 --> 13:36.282
I have TP'ed houses.

13:37.732 --> 13:39.691
Yeah, and you made
the biggest decision of our lives

13:39.692 --> 13:41.151
without me.

13:41.152 --> 13:42.231
Where are you going?

13:42.232 --> 13:44.151
I'm going to the store.

13:44.152 --> 13:45.231
'Cause if things weren't
bad enough,

13:45.232 --> 13:47.197
we're out of my cereal.

13:54.192 --> 13:55.361
I don't get you, man.

13:55.362 --> 13:56.571
For the last three years
all I hear is,

13:56.572 --> 13:57.571
"I want a kid, I want a kid!"

13:57.572 --> 13:59.071
Now you could have a kid,
you don't want the kid.

13:59.072 --> 14:00.652
Are you kidding me?

14:02.232 --> 14:04.021
I just want to
make the right decision.

14:04.022 --> 14:05.571
What do we know about this baby?

14:05.572 --> 14:08.232
It sleeps, it poops,
and it cries when it's hungry.

14:10.482 --> 14:11.782
You two should get on famously.

14:15.152 --> 14:17.691
Yeah, but it's not ours,
me and Molly's, you know?

14:17.692 --> 14:19.651
I always imagined
that when we had a baby,

14:19.652 --> 14:21.151
it would look like me, okay?

14:21.152 --> 14:23.192
All babies look like you.

14:25.282 --> 14:27.321
Look, adoption
is a wonderful thing.

14:27.322 --> 14:28.521
It's-it's just not for me.

14:28.522 --> 14:29.981
Why not?

14:29.982 --> 14:31.151
I mean, if you're worried
that the kid won't love you,

14:31.152 --> 14:32.151
you're wrong.

14:32.152 --> 14:33.611
I was raised by my grandma

14:33.612 --> 14:35.692
and I loved her even more
because she chose to do it.

14:36.522 --> 14:38.691
It's not about
the kid loving me.

14:38.692 --> 14:39.732
What if...

14:41.862 --> 14:43.151
What if I can't love it back

14:43.152 --> 14:46.612
because deep down
I know that it's not mine?

14:47.652 --> 14:49.021
That's what
you're worried about?

14:49.022 --> 14:50.361
Well, I'm just being honest.

14:50.362 --> 14:52.361
I mean, that's not fair
to the kid.

14:52.362 --> 14:55.071
Children need to be
taken care of and loved.

14:55.072 --> 14:56.281
Come on, man.

14:56.282 --> 14:58.401
You are the most loving
person I've ever met.

14:58.402 --> 15:01.402
We have never passed a baby that you
didn't play peek-a-boo with.

15:03.232 --> 15:06.071
And the kid always got
tired of it before you did.

15:08.232 --> 15:09.401
Hey, Mike.

15:09.402 --> 15:11.781
I would love to have you
as a father.

15:11.782 --> 15:13.441
In some ways you were.

15:13.442 --> 15:15.361
You taught me to drive,

15:15.362 --> 15:17.361
took me voting after
I got my citizenship,

15:17.362 --> 15:19.442
and vastly underpaid me
to do your yardwork.

15:28.152 --> 15:29.151
Oh, good, you're home.

15:29.152 --> 15:30.361
Listen, about the baby...

15:30.362 --> 15:31.901
Okay, okay before
you say anything,

15:31.902 --> 15:33.691
I know I made this decision
without you,

15:33.692 --> 15:35.191
but it doesn't mean
that it's not the right one.

15:35.192 --> 15:36.441
I agree, you're right.

15:36.442 --> 15:39.941
But what if I'm right, huh?

15:39.942 --> 15:41.151
Okay, I know you
don't like change,

15:41.152 --> 15:44.401
and sometimes I make
you change and you like it.

15:44.402 --> 15:45.401
Remember how you put up a fight

15:45.402 --> 15:46.862
about putting mushrooms
on a burger?

15:49.072 --> 15:50.441
Here.

15:50.442 --> 15:52.361
What is this?

15:52.362 --> 15:53.362
Open it.

15:56.072 --> 16:00.611
A necklace that says, "Wow."

16:00.612 --> 16:03.192
Flip it over.

16:05.112 --> 16:06.112
"Mom."

16:07.692 --> 16:09.361
You're always right.

16:09.362 --> 16:12.692
I would love nothing more
than to give that baby a home.

16:13.612 --> 16:15.322
I love you so much.

16:21.782 --> 16:22.981
Hey!

16:22.982 --> 16:25.732
Where's Frannie?
I got her a little gift, too.

16:26.782 --> 16:28.731
She's upstairs, I...

16:28.732 --> 16:30.521
- I'll go get her!
- Okay.

16:32.232 --> 16:34.782
"Trix are for Frannie."

16:37.782 --> 16:40.111
"And Mike."

16:40.112 --> 16:42.192
She did eat some of mine.

16:43.362 --> 16:45.231
Mike!

16:45.232 --> 16:47.919
- She's gone. Frannie's not down there.
- Gone where?

16:48.732 --> 16:49.731
"Ms. Flynn,

16:49.732 --> 16:50.781
"Thank for everything.

16:50.782 --> 16:52.191
"Sorry for causing
so much trouble

16:52.192 --> 16:53.942
between you and Mr. Flynn."

16:54.982 --> 16:56.571
I-I didn't take your name.

16:56.572 --> 16:58.651
Okay, that is not
the important thing right now.

16:58.652 --> 16:59.781
Okay, okay.
Let's get our coats.

16:59.782 --> 17:01.572
Come on, get in the car.

17:04.612 --> 17:06.781
Mike, there's no way
that she's gonna go back

17:06.781 --> 17:08.281
to the same place I found her.

17:08.281 --> 17:09.281
There she is.

17:10.692 --> 17:12.820
How have you not
made detective yet?

17:14.152 --> 17:17.021
Frannie, honey, what are you
doing back out here?

17:17.021 --> 17:18.521
Really, I'm-I'm good, Ms. Flynn.

17:18.521 --> 17:19.521
Okay, come on, kiddo.

17:19.521 --> 17:21.281
You are coming home with us.

17:21.281 --> 17:23.781
Why? Why, so that you guys
can argue some more?

17:23.781 --> 17:26.281
I heard you fighting.

17:26.281 --> 17:27.731
Look, you're both so nice.

17:27.732 --> 17:30.021
I don't want to cause any more
trouble than I already have.

17:30.022 --> 17:31.571
What trouble? I mean,
the fight's over.

17:31.572 --> 17:33.191
Mike didn't mean what he said.

17:33.192 --> 17:34.151
Yeah, I'm a knucklehead.

17:34.152 --> 17:36.191
He's a knucklehead.

17:36.192 --> 17:38.521
Sometimes, it-it just takes him
a minute to come around.

17:38.522 --> 17:40.321
Yeah, but once I do,
I am on board.

17:40.322 --> 17:42.731
And I am fully on board
for this, Frannie.

17:42.732 --> 17:43.731
For everything.

17:43.732 --> 17:45.862
Yeah, we both-we both are.

17:46.732 --> 17:48.231
Are you sure?

17:48.232 --> 17:50.941
'Cause you know, being a parent
is a big responsibility.

17:50.942 --> 17:53.192
Can't be out late like this
roaming the streets.

17:54.192 --> 17:56.322
Dude, we know.

17:57.572 --> 18:00.191
All right then.
Let's go home.

18:00.192 --> 18:02.282
All right, okay.
