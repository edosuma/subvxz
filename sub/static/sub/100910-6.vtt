WEBVTT

00:05.339 --> 00:06.307
Previously on Hightown...

00:06.340 --> 00:07.408
I know all about Osito.

00:07.441 --> 00:10.211
- His hot white girlfriend.
- Kathleen's not that hot.

00:10.244 --> 00:12.613
My friend died.
Saw it, too.

00:12.646 --> 00:16.484
My girl Sherry.
Scotty, you can't tell anybody.

00:16.517 --> 00:17.651
We need to talk
about this witness shit.

00:17.685 --> 00:20.521
- Get her off the books.
- It's done, padrÃ³n.

00:20.554 --> 00:23.057
- What if we go to Bourne?
- We could go get her.

00:23.090 --> 00:24.091
Rescue mission!

00:24.125 --> 00:25.526
Krista Collins,
we got you, girl!

00:25.559 --> 00:27.561
I need a taste of that of that
pure fire y'all fuck with.

00:27.595 --> 00:29.063
Shit, you ain't even
gonna need a lot.

00:29.096 --> 00:30.531
Just enough to kill
a dope fiend.

00:30.564 --> 00:32.066
Hey, this is Jackie.
Do your thing.

00:32.099 --> 00:34.368
If you want to help me, help.

00:38.038 --> 00:40.174
Oh, my God.
Help!

00:41.776 --> 00:43.110
Osito!

00:44.512 --> 00:47.281
- Ray, you found her?
- Krista Collins is dead.

02:35.689 --> 02:37.391
Thank you, gentlemen.

02:55.342 --> 02:58.212
Hey, Alan,
you get with motel security?

02:58.245 --> 03:00.247
Yeah, we've got the cameras,
hard drives,

03:00.281 --> 03:02.383
the whole nine--
we can go home now.

03:02.416 --> 03:03.751
Marla, tell him
what you told me.

03:03.784 --> 03:05.886
I saw a guy go in the girl's
room last night.

03:05.920 --> 03:07.755
Oh, you did?
What time was this?

03:07.788 --> 03:10.391
- Maybe 10:00, 11:00, 12:00-ish.
- Mm-hmm.

03:10.424 --> 03:11.725
Okay, uh, how long
was he in there?

03:11.759 --> 03:14.261
I'm not sure.
I didn't see him come out.

03:14.295 --> 03:15.663
What did he look like?

03:15.696 --> 03:17.932
White guy, kind of tall.

03:17.965 --> 03:19.233
Tall white guy?

03:19.266 --> 03:21.402
I mean, you know, tall-ish.

03:21.435 --> 03:24.605
But then a few minutes later,
a big dude went in there, too.

03:24.638 --> 03:25.673
Just let himself in.

03:25.706 --> 03:27.341
Okay, that's good.
Now, a big guy.

03:27.374 --> 03:29.276
Like, big?
Like that?

03:29.310 --> 03:31.812
Was he white or black?

03:31.845 --> 03:33.480
I'm not sure.

03:33.514 --> 03:35.349
She didn't have her glasses on.

03:37.718 --> 03:39.553
Why didn't you have
your glasses on?

03:39.587 --> 03:41.989
You ever suck dick in glasses?

03:44.858 --> 03:46.961
No, I can't say I have.

03:46.994 --> 03:49.363
Anyway, fat guy, tall guy

03:49.396 --> 03:51.665
is pretty good, right?

03:51.699 --> 03:52.700
That should be worth something.

03:52.733 --> 03:54.268
Hey, Jim, no one leaves.

03:54.301 --> 03:55.369
I want statements
from everybody.

03:55.402 --> 03:56.437
If they're holding,

03:56.470 --> 03:57.671
you charge them
with possession

03:57.705 --> 03:59.573
unless they have something
interesting to say.

03:59.607 --> 04:01.942
And, hey, not her.

04:03.644 --> 04:05.813
Thank you.

04:05.846 --> 04:07.715
Thank you, madam.

04:07.748 --> 04:09.984
And they're all
fucking like that.

04:26.467 --> 04:30.471
Hey, Jackie.
How you doing?

04:30.504 --> 04:32.873
- I've been better.
- Rough night?

04:35.275 --> 04:37.511
You met my partner,
Alan Saintille.

04:37.544 --> 04:39.413
How you doing?

04:39.446 --> 04:42.783
Well, I'm really glad
you could come up here to
Bourne,

04:42.816 --> 04:45.619
and, uh, I'm gonna ask you
a few questions.

04:45.653 --> 04:46.854
Okay.

04:46.887 --> 04:48.756
Why'd you call Krista Collins
this morning?

04:48.789 --> 04:49.990
I was calling her back,
all right?

04:50.024 --> 04:51.392
- She called me.
- Why?

04:51.425 --> 04:52.860
'Cause I left a note
with my number on it.

04:52.893 --> 04:55.596
So you found her?

04:55.629 --> 04:58.332
Why didn't you tell me?

04:58.365 --> 05:00.701
Honestly, I didn't think
you'd give a shit.

05:00.734 --> 05:01.769
Really?

05:01.802 --> 05:03.871
See, that was a big error
in judgment.

05:03.904 --> 05:06.840
- You should have told me.
- Why?

05:06.874 --> 05:08.876
She might be still
alive right now.

05:12.046 --> 05:14.948
I told you Krista was in danger
a week ago.

05:14.982 --> 05:17.551
I have been doing your job for
you this whole fucking time,

05:17.584 --> 05:19.787
so maybe if you would have
listened to me, she'd still be
alive.

05:19.820 --> 05:21.355
Why didn't you
answer your phone?

05:21.388 --> 05:22.856
What, you ever miss
a fucking call?

05:22.890 --> 05:24.725
No, you got fucking drunk,
and you dropped the ball.

05:24.758 --> 05:26.460
I mean, hell,
you're still drunk.

05:26.493 --> 05:27.828
Hey, now.
Hey, hey.

05:27.861 --> 05:30.564
We're all on the same team here,
all right?

05:30.597 --> 05:33.067
If it wasn't for you,
we would've never heard

05:33.100 --> 05:35.469
of Krista Collins.

05:35.502 --> 05:37.337
And we would've never made
the connection between her

05:37.371 --> 05:38.806
and Sherry Henry.

05:38.839 --> 05:41.475
That's no small thing.

05:50.951 --> 05:53.353
Okay, you tell me
what happened?

05:55.689 --> 05:57.591
She was beaten to death.

06:01.595 --> 06:02.763
Can I see her?

06:02.796 --> 06:04.732
That's not a good idea.

06:07.768 --> 06:09.670
Do you know who killed her?

06:12.706 --> 06:16.376
You know Frankie Cuevas?

06:16.410 --> 06:18.645
Never heard of him?
Big-time drug trafficker on the
Cape.

06:18.679 --> 06:20.047
Mm-mm.

06:20.080 --> 06:21.949
He's in Mass State Correctional
right now awaiting trial,

06:21.982 --> 06:23.851
but we think he ordered the hit.

06:23.884 --> 06:25.719
Is he the same person
who killed Sherry?

06:25.753 --> 06:26.987
We think so, yeah.

06:27.020 --> 06:29.022
Sent one of his associates
to do his dirty work.

06:29.056 --> 06:30.991
Krista and Sherry,
they're just collateral damage--

06:31.024 --> 06:32.159
the price of doing business.

06:32.392 --> 06:33.594
How long is he in jail for?

06:33.627 --> 06:35.896
He's looking at 15 years
for trafficking and distribution

06:35.929 --> 06:37.698
but I'm gonna be
honest with you.

06:37.731 --> 06:39.166
He'll parole out
in five to seven.

06:39.399 --> 06:41.001
Unless we get him
for these two murders.

06:41.034 --> 06:43.103
Fuck, I hope he fucking dies
in there,

06:43.137 --> 06:46.440
gets asshole cancer,
and rots from the inside out.

06:46.473 --> 06:48.876
Yeah, you and me both.

06:51.912 --> 06:53.580
Hey...

06:53.614 --> 06:55.449
you gonna be all right?

06:58.485 --> 07:00.120
Yeah, man,
I'm just trying to figure out

07:00.154 --> 07:02.990
what the fuck I'm
supposed to do now.

07:08.428 --> 07:11.765
Go home.
Live your life.

07:20.474 --> 07:23.143
Take care of that hangover.

07:54.875 --> 07:56.543
Hello?

07:56.577 --> 07:58.045
Your daughter's crying.

07:59.680 --> 08:03.016
I'm trying to make breakfast.
What's the matter with you?

08:03.050 --> 08:05.619
I'm such a fucking
piece of shit.

08:05.652 --> 08:06.954
Shut the fuck up.

08:06.987 --> 08:09.056
It's true.
I don't deserve you guys.

08:11.225 --> 08:12.960
What are you talking about?
What happened?

08:12.993 --> 08:14.161
Nothing.

08:16.496 --> 08:17.865
Tell me the truth.
Did you pick up?

08:17.898 --> 08:19.666
No.

08:19.700 --> 08:21.235
If you're using,
you need to tell me right now.

08:21.268 --> 08:22.936
I'm not using.

08:28.041 --> 08:30.978
Okay.

08:31.011 --> 08:33.247
Then you're good.

08:33.280 --> 08:34.948
Whatever it is, you'll fix it.

08:34.982 --> 08:36.683
Hey, hey, hey.

08:36.717 --> 08:39.519
Need a diaper change, baby girl?

08:39.553 --> 08:41.555
Oh, come here.
Come here.

08:41.588 --> 08:43.123
Oh!

08:43.156 --> 08:45.659
Hey, you remember Erica Alden?

08:45.692 --> 08:47.527
She's a real estate agent now.

08:47.561 --> 08:49.296
I ran into her
at the Stop & Shop,

08:49.529 --> 08:52.065
and she told me about this
killer new townhouse for rent

08:52.099 --> 08:53.133
on Shankpainter.

08:53.166 --> 08:56.536
There's an open house tomorrow.
It's not even listed yet.

08:56.570 --> 08:57.804
I think we should go.

08:57.838 --> 08:59.740
- Sure.
- Really?

08:59.773 --> 09:01.942
Yeah.

09:01.975 --> 09:04.011
Yeah.

09:05.646 --> 09:07.881
Thanks, boo.
Oh, okay.

09:07.915 --> 09:09.116
Yeah, here,
you take the baby.

09:12.886 --> 09:15.756
Look at Dad.
Hi, hi.

09:22.896 --> 09:24.965
It's okay.

09:33.106 --> 09:35.108
- Yeah, no, I know.
- Whee! Whee!

09:35.142 --> 09:36.576
I--stop it.

09:36.610 --> 09:38.812
You're gonna bust your head.

09:41.281 --> 09:42.349
Um, no.

09:42.582 --> 09:45.052
No, but Thursday night
is really good for me,

09:45.085 --> 09:46.787
if you can do it.

09:46.820 --> 09:48.121
Or else Teresa.

09:49.823 --> 09:53.727
Okay, pu--I need you to put your
shoes on and come eat your
breakfast, please.

09:53.760 --> 09:57.097
No, Mom, I don't think
I let him watch too much TV.

09:57.130 --> 09:59.132
Obviously you're--

09:59.166 --> 10:01.635
Frankie!

10:01.668 --> 10:04.104
Hey, hey, you okay?
You okay?

10:04.137 --> 10:05.973
Let me see.
Let me see.

10:06.006 --> 10:07.374
Okay, come here.
Come on.

10:39.006 --> 10:41.041
Oh, Jesus.

10:41.074 --> 10:43.276
You okay?

10:43.310 --> 10:45.278
I'm sorry.

10:45.312 --> 10:48.115
I just didn't know where to go.

10:50.150 --> 10:51.985
What happened?

10:52.019 --> 10:53.820
Are you in trouble?

10:53.854 --> 10:56.323
No, it's just...

10:56.356 --> 10:59.259
my life is so fucked.

10:59.292 --> 11:02.662
I dr--I drink one day--
one day,

11:02.696 --> 11:04.231
and I fucked up everything.

11:09.369 --> 11:12.372
It's--it's okay, Jack.
It's okay.

11:20.047 --> 11:21.448
It's okay.

11:25.218 --> 11:26.987
Why don't you take
a sick day tomorrow?

11:27.020 --> 11:29.389
I'll do the paperwork
for the BFO.

11:29.423 --> 11:30.991
- All right?
- Okay.

11:31.024 --> 11:32.392
Thank you.

11:32.426 --> 11:33.994
It's okay.

11:35.896 --> 11:38.765
And then maybe hit up
one of those meetings?

11:44.805 --> 11:46.907
Hey, man.
Anything?

11:46.940 --> 11:49.276
Yeah, two people mentioned
a dealer, Scotty.

11:49.309 --> 11:51.211
Pumps out of the, uh,
motel parking lot.

11:51.244 --> 11:53.947
Sounds small-time, but he could
be connected to Frankie.

11:53.980 --> 11:56.083
Love it. Bring him in.

11:58.318 --> 12:00.053
Okay, so we got
O'Donnell's Auto Body

12:00.087 --> 12:01.154
and Kathleen's house.

12:01.188 --> 12:02.856
Hey, how do you rewind
this thing?

12:02.889 --> 12:04.024
Oh, you don't have
to worry about it,

12:04.057 --> 12:05.392
'cause I got it all logged
right here.

12:05.425 --> 12:08.395
At 10:02 p.m.,
a gold Maxima left O'Donnell's

12:08.428 --> 12:12.265
and returned at 3:17 a.m.,
but we couldn't get eyes on the
driver.

12:12.299 --> 12:13.733
You did all this yourself?

12:13.767 --> 12:15.402
Yes.

12:15.435 --> 12:17.404
Huh.

12:18.972 --> 12:20.407
Hey, uh, Ray.

12:20.440 --> 12:23.043
You think you can talk to LT
about my ergonomic chair?

12:23.076 --> 12:26.113
'Cause I put in a request,
like, two months ago and--

12:26.146 --> 12:27.814
Yeah, no,
I'm all over it.

12:27.848 --> 12:29.483
Alan, look at this.

12:32.085 --> 12:33.253
Fucking Ray.

12:33.286 --> 12:35.188
The car left
O'Donnell's at 10:02,

12:35.222 --> 12:36.289
came back at 3:17.

12:36.323 --> 12:37.824
Whoever's driving
the gold Maxima,

12:37.858 --> 12:40.193
who I'll bet my balls was Osito
and a tall white accomplice,

12:40.227 --> 12:42.295
left O'Donnell's with plenty of
time to get to Bourne,

12:42.329 --> 12:43.930
kill Krista, make it back.

12:43.964 --> 12:46.199
We're working on getting
security footage from the bridge
cam.

12:46.233 --> 12:47.501
Hopefully confirm
they went off the Cape.

12:47.534 --> 12:50.103
Even if you get it,
it's circumstantial.

12:50.137 --> 12:51.872
Well, if the DA had signed off
on the wiretap--

12:51.905 --> 12:54.174
If I had a handsome face
and a good body,

12:54.207 --> 12:55.542
I'd be married
to a Penthouse Pet,

12:55.775 --> 12:58.278
but I don't, and I'm not.

12:58.311 --> 13:00.814
I know you want Osito
to be your guy.

13:00.847 --> 13:02.983
So, instead of whining to me,

13:03.016 --> 13:05.252
go put him at the fucking motel.

13:09.289 --> 13:10.357
Yes, sir.

13:16.129 --> 13:17.564
Velekee, man.

13:20.333 --> 13:23.069
You calling lieutenant
an asshole?

13:23.103 --> 13:25.005
I'm not calling lieutenant
an asshole.

13:25.038 --> 13:27.407
You're calling
lieutenant an asshole.

13:29.342 --> 13:32.179
Oh, shit.

13:32.212 --> 13:34.481
I got to get--take care
of something, man.

13:37.317 --> 13:39.085
Yeah, sure.

13:39.119 --> 13:41.154
I'll stay here
and work on this homicide.

13:41.188 --> 13:42.355
You do you.

13:48.295 --> 13:51.031
Hey.
Hey, hey, hey, what happened?

13:51.064 --> 13:52.199
Hey.

13:52.232 --> 13:55.068
Sorry, I-I didn't know
if I should tell you. I--

13:55.101 --> 13:57.204
No, of course, of course, of
course, of course, of course.

13:57.237 --> 13:59.940
Hey, buddy.

13:59.973 --> 14:01.474
Hey, what happened, man?

14:01.508 --> 14:03.210
Did you forget
to keep your hands up?

14:03.243 --> 14:05.612
I fell off the couch.

14:05.845 --> 14:08.348
He fell off the couch?

14:08.381 --> 14:10.383
Yeah.
He's gonna be okay.

14:10.417 --> 14:12.552
It was just a couple stitches

14:12.586 --> 14:15.021
and said we can
go home soon, so...

14:16.289 --> 14:17.357
There was just--

14:17.390 --> 14:19.059
there was a lot of blood,
you know?

14:19.092 --> 14:21.161
I know. I know.
Hey, hey, hey.

14:21.194 --> 14:24.397
Not your fault, okay?
Stuff happens.

14:24.431 --> 14:26.066
Luckily, they're made
out of rubber.

14:26.099 --> 14:27.500
He's just gonna bounce
right back.

14:29.402 --> 14:31.938
Yeah.

14:31.972 --> 14:33.273
Thanks for coming.

14:33.306 --> 14:34.541
Of course.

14:40.580 --> 14:43.116
What are we doing, Ray?

14:48.054 --> 14:49.456
I don't know.

14:51.291 --> 14:52.993
But I like it.

14:55.128 --> 14:56.630
Me too.

14:59.666 --> 15:02.269
Hey, there.

15:02.302 --> 15:04.104
Hey, so, uh, shit's hitting
the fan at work.

15:04.137 --> 15:05.672
- I'm gonna have to get back.
- Yeah.

15:05.905 --> 15:06.940
Okay, I'm gonna come by later.

15:06.973 --> 15:08.975
I'm gonna check
on you guys, okay?

15:13.513 --> 15:15.181
You're a good mom.

15:44.377 --> 15:45.512
Back already?

15:45.545 --> 15:47.614
What up, Charmaine?

15:47.647 --> 15:50.650
I got to talk to Wayne.

15:50.684 --> 15:52.686
How'd that thing go last night?

15:52.719 --> 15:55.388
You a nosy little G.

15:55.422 --> 15:57.524
Let me talk to your uncle.

16:04.331 --> 16:05.999
What up, Wayne?

16:09.336 --> 16:12.505
I've been thinking
about that offer you made.

16:12.539 --> 16:14.674
So you want to step out
on Frankie?

16:17.577 --> 16:18.745
Maybe.

16:20.280 --> 16:21.981
If you can do me six fingers
for two.

16:23.016 --> 16:24.417
I got to think about that.

16:26.186 --> 16:29.356
I can do five, six a week easy,
if you cut me a break.

16:29.389 --> 16:30.757
Them Cape heads be fiending.

16:30.990 --> 16:33.293
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

16:33.326 --> 16:34.994
All right, then.

16:35.028 --> 16:36.129
Six for two.

16:36.162 --> 16:38.498
I also need a half tina,
and if you got Molly,

16:38.531 --> 16:40.433
I'll take a jar.

16:40.467 --> 16:42.669
Trying to do business with
the maricÃ³ns down in P-Town.

16:42.702 --> 16:45.271
All right,
I got you.

16:45.305 --> 16:48.141
Uh, so that'll be, um...

16:48.174 --> 16:49.576
Seven K.

16:49.609 --> 16:52.412
What I told you about minding
your own business, Charmaine?

16:55.248 --> 16:57.317
Seven K.

17:32.085 --> 17:35.555
Six fingers,
half tina, and a jar.

17:37.090 --> 17:38.691
Got yourself
a good little worker there.

17:38.725 --> 17:40.427
At least she good
for something.

17:40.460 --> 17:42.195
This between us?

17:42.228 --> 17:44.230
'Cause I ain't trying
to piss off Frankie.

17:44.264 --> 17:45.732
Believe that.

17:45.765 --> 17:48.601
Oh, you don't live to be my age
by running your mouth.

17:48.635 --> 17:50.136
Believe that.

17:58.611 --> 18:01.781
Hey, yo, check it out.

18:01.815 --> 18:03.316
Bridge cam.

18:05.218 --> 18:07.420
They went over at 10:42 p.m.

18:07.454 --> 18:10.123
Here they are coming back
at 1:23 a.m.

18:10.156 --> 18:11.558
- Fuck, if that's not Osito--
- Hell, yeah.

18:11.591 --> 18:13.460
And our white boy right there.

18:13.493 --> 18:15.728
Blurry white boy in a ball cap.

18:15.762 --> 18:18.231
Yep, that narrows it down.

18:28.174 --> 18:29.476
What up?

18:34.848 --> 18:37.550
You heard anything
from Frankie?

18:37.584 --> 18:38.818
No.

18:40.386 --> 18:42.655
He gonna be on our ass
for last night.

18:42.689 --> 18:44.557
Who gives a fuck?
Let him kill me.

18:46.893 --> 18:48.361
You hanging in?

18:49.863 --> 18:51.664
This whole thing is so fucked.

18:53.867 --> 18:57.203
Only cure for that,
got to keep hustling.

18:57.237 --> 18:59.472
Make that money.
Get your girl something nice.

18:59.506 --> 19:01.307
Get your dick wet.

19:01.341 --> 19:02.542
Remember what it's all about.

19:02.575 --> 19:04.177
- Yeah, whatever.
- Yeah.

19:04.210 --> 19:06.446
Whatever I say.

19:11.417 --> 19:15.154
It's just you and me till
we see how Frankie gonna act.

19:15.188 --> 19:18.358
But I got that
New Beige hookup.

19:18.391 --> 19:21.327
So we gonna start some stuff
down by you in P-Town.

19:21.361 --> 19:23.396
You feel me?

19:28.201 --> 19:29.736
What the fuck is this for?

19:29.769 --> 19:31.538
You a soldier now.

19:31.571 --> 19:33.473
Got to watch your back.

19:42.549 --> 19:44.617
Make that money.

19:44.651 --> 19:45.752
You'll see.

19:54.460 --> 19:56.396
Let's thank Helen
for a great share.

20:06.439 --> 20:09.943
This is the time we reserve
for newcomers to share.

20:09.976 --> 20:12.612
Anyone in their first 30 days?

20:20.587 --> 20:22.822
Hi, I'm Jackie.
I'm an alcoholic.

20:22.855 --> 20:24.891
Hi, Jackie.

20:24.924 --> 20:28.928
Hey, um, I'm not really sure
why I'm here.

20:30.229 --> 20:32.432
I mean, I-I definitely know
that I can't drink,

20:32.465 --> 20:33.933
but that's...

20:33.967 --> 20:36.336
That's pretty much all I know.

20:36.369 --> 20:40.273
Uh, I tried the AA thing before.

20:40.306 --> 20:42.809
And I don't know.
I guess I did it wrong.

20:45.578 --> 20:47.814
So, uh, I need
to try something new,

20:47.847 --> 20:51.317
but I have no fucking idea
what that is.

20:54.387 --> 20:56.255
Yeah.

20:57.323 --> 20:58.491
Thank you, Jackie.

20:58.524 --> 21:00.426
Welcome back.

21:00.460 --> 21:02.729
Now a little bit
of housekeeping.

21:02.762 --> 21:04.631
There was a no-show
on the coffee.

21:04.664 --> 21:05.932
Anyone know where Junior is?

21:33.726 --> 21:38.331
H, meth, Molly?

21:43.403 --> 21:45.838
Can I get two hits of Molly?

21:48.875 --> 21:52.679
- Gonna be 100.
- What? It's 60 in LA.

21:52.712 --> 21:54.013
Yeah, well, this
ain't LA, is it?

21:54.047 --> 21:56.649
God.

21:56.683 --> 21:58.384
You want to fucking
go right now?

21:58.418 --> 22:00.420
No, I don't want to go.

22:00.453 --> 22:02.855
Why would I want to do that?

22:05.892 --> 22:09.095
Here, just take your money.

22:09.328 --> 22:10.630
Hello?

22:10.663 --> 22:12.465
Take it.

22:14.801 --> 22:16.869
Townies here are the worst.

22:24.877 --> 22:26.479
Yo.

22:29.449 --> 22:31.017
Where you been, man?
I was looking for you at the
meeting.

22:31.050 --> 22:33.052
Why do you give a fuck?
You're not in AA anymore, right?

22:33.086 --> 22:35.788
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

22:35.822 --> 22:37.890
I just had the worst 24 hours
of my life, okay?

22:37.924 --> 22:42.095
You know that girl Krista?
She died. She was murdered.

22:42.128 --> 22:43.629
Shit.

22:46.432 --> 22:50.002
Hey, you know some dude named
Frankie Cuevas?

22:50.036 --> 22:52.839
What?
No, what are you talking about?

22:52.872 --> 22:55.074
I don't know.
I-I just figured that you deal
drugs.

22:55.108 --> 22:56.609
He deals drugs.
You might've heard of him.

22:56.642 --> 22:58.544
Yeah, well, I haven't.

22:58.578 --> 23:00.113
Okay, wow.
Jesus, sorry.

23:00.146 --> 23:01.748
I'm sorry to bother you
with my shit.

23:01.781 --> 23:03.416
Why the fuck
are you being so weird?

23:06.052 --> 23:08.087
Look, it's not all about you,
Jack, all right?

23:08.121 --> 23:10.022
I got my own fucking bullshit,
too, you know?

23:10.056 --> 23:11.424
Yeah, no shit it's
not all about me.

23:11.457 --> 23:12.658
That's why I was trying
to help Krista.

23:12.692 --> 23:14.994
Oh, well, that really worked
out, didn't it?

23:15.027 --> 23:17.430
She fucking died.

23:17.463 --> 23:18.931
Fuck you.

23:18.965 --> 23:21.000
Yeah, fuck you, dude.

24:22.762 --> 24:25.998
It's like chocolate sprinkles
on vanilla ice cream.

24:29.468 --> 24:31.170
Is it?

24:33.172 --> 24:35.942
I'm so cold.

24:37.643 --> 24:40.112
I'm sorry.

24:40.146 --> 24:43.115
What do you want me to do?

24:45.551 --> 24:47.687
Don't be a fucking pussy.

24:51.123 --> 24:54.227
Wait, wait, wait.
What am I supposed to do?

24:58.931 --> 25:02.668
Tell me what
I'm supposed to do!

25:48.180 --> 25:50.783
Don't be a fucking pussy.

26:09.936 --> 26:12.905
You got to go soon.
Okay, put them back.

26:12.939 --> 26:14.140
How's work?

26:14.173 --> 26:16.575
Fine.

26:16.609 --> 26:18.978
How's everything
been going for you?

26:19.011 --> 26:21.981
Ah, my sorry-ass crew.

26:22.014 --> 26:24.817
I could've done better hiring
them out of the Home Depot
parking lot.

26:24.850 --> 26:26.185
Yeah.

26:28.020 --> 26:30.856
Hey, why don't you go give
Daddy a hug?

26:32.325 --> 26:34.160
Mm, venga.

26:34.193 --> 26:36.195
Careful.
Careful, his stitches.

26:36.228 --> 26:37.296
Oh.

26:38.931 --> 26:41.233
Can I play a video game?

26:41.267 --> 26:43.002
No.
No screens.

26:43.035 --> 26:44.170
Please?

26:44.203 --> 26:46.339
You saw me hand the iPad
to the guard, right?

26:46.372 --> 26:48.975
- I don't have it.
- You got an iPad, papi?

26:49.008 --> 26:52.044
Yes, Uncle Ray got it for me.

26:59.752 --> 27:01.187
Why don't you go sit over there
for a minute?

27:01.220 --> 27:03.255
- Let me talk to your mother.
- Okay.

27:06.292 --> 27:07.760
Uncle Ray?

27:07.793 --> 27:08.861
You told me to keep him close.

27:08.894 --> 27:09.996
Not close to my son.

27:10.029 --> 27:12.031
Mm, yeah, well,
ever since you got arrested,

27:12.064 --> 27:14.300
I'm in a shitty one-bedroom.

27:14.333 --> 27:16.402
What the fuck do you want
from me?

27:18.671 --> 27:22.274
I want to know what he knows.
I want to know his secrets.

27:22.308 --> 27:24.377
I want every time he comes
in your fucking mouth,

27:24.410 --> 27:27.113
to tell you something
you can use.

27:27.146 --> 27:30.249
- Is that what's happening?
- No.

27:30.282 --> 27:32.418
We don't even talk
about that shit anymore.

27:32.651 --> 27:34.286
Then what the fuck
do you talk about?

27:37.323 --> 27:40.893
I don't know, Frankie.
Stuff, all right?

27:40.926 --> 27:42.361
The guy's sprung.

27:45.398 --> 27:47.833
You're a whore.

27:47.867 --> 27:49.135
Don't call me that.

27:49.168 --> 27:51.070
No, you're right.

27:51.103 --> 27:53.205
A whore would've got
something from him.

27:55.241 --> 27:58.010
You think you're special,
don't you?

27:58.044 --> 28:01.447
But he was fucking
the last one, too.

28:01.680 --> 28:04.250
What are you talking about?

28:04.283 --> 28:06.685
Sherry Henry.

28:08.120 --> 28:10.756
- I don't believe you.
- I don't care.

28:10.790 --> 28:12.324
It's true.

28:12.358 --> 28:15.895
You're not my pimp, Frankie.

28:15.928 --> 28:19.065
All right?
You're not--you're not my boss.

28:21.434 --> 28:24.103
You know, you're not even
my fucking husband.

28:27.239 --> 28:29.408
I'm not 19 anymore...

28:31.310 --> 28:34.947
Looking at you
with puppy-dog eyes.

28:34.980 --> 28:37.416
Mr. Big Shot dealer
taking me to Sizzler.

28:42.955 --> 28:45.291
I'm a grown woman.

28:47.059 --> 28:48.894
No, you're right.

28:48.928 --> 28:52.331
You're not 19 anymore.

28:52.364 --> 28:55.835
How much longer you think
you have at Xavier's?

28:55.868 --> 28:58.437
Five years?
Ten?

29:01.307 --> 29:03.275
You better think long and hard

29:03.309 --> 29:05.277
about what the play is here.

29:05.311 --> 29:09.448
You're gonna realize
that you and me...

29:12.218 --> 29:15.287
We're forever.

29:25.364 --> 29:27.800
Frankie.

29:27.833 --> 29:29.468
Come on, let's go.

29:34.840 --> 29:36.242
Mommy's got to get to work.

30:06.405 --> 30:07.907
Okay.

31:03.996 --> 31:06.265
Hey, guys.

31:06.298 --> 31:08.968
It's me, Candy,

31:09.001 --> 31:11.570
and I've missed you so much.

31:11.604 --> 31:14.440
Ooh, watch your step, Scotty.

31:21.914 --> 31:25.217
Hey, Les.

31:26.952 --> 31:28.420
That's Scotty Frazier.

31:28.454 --> 31:30.456
He was pumping out of that same
motel until yesterday.

31:30.489 --> 31:31.991
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

31:32.024 --> 31:34.159
Little shit moved his operation
to the Dibby Donuts next door.

31:34.193 --> 31:35.527
All right, cool.
Let me know when he's ready.

31:35.561 --> 31:37.496
- Hey.
- Hmm?

31:37.529 --> 31:38.664
My collar, my interview.

31:38.897 --> 31:40.899
I'm gonna take this one,
if you don't mind.

31:40.933 --> 31:43.035
I pulled him off the shitter
in a Dibby Donuts bathroom.

31:43.068 --> 31:44.937
I think I can
handle an interview.

31:44.970 --> 31:47.306
Hey, I'll tell you what.

31:47.339 --> 31:49.108
He looks like he's feeling
pretty good right now.

31:50.309 --> 31:52.978
Why don't we wait a few hours,
we'll do it together?

31:53.012 --> 31:54.546
Hmm?

32:59.411 --> 33:01.213
Ladies and gentlemen,

33:01.246 --> 33:03.415
Let's give it up for Candy.

33:18.731 --> 33:20.466
Hey, sexy.

33:20.499 --> 33:22.501
How you doing?

33:22.534 --> 33:24.169
Better now that you're here.

33:25.537 --> 33:27.306
- Can I buy you a drink?
- Yeah.

33:27.339 --> 33:30.743
Or I could give you
a private dance.

33:30.776 --> 33:32.544
You give dances to women?

33:32.578 --> 33:34.213
Of course.

34:21.560 --> 34:23.662
It's okay.
I let girls do more.

34:37.509 --> 34:39.645
You're beautiful,
you know that?

34:39.678 --> 34:41.447
You're really beautiful, too.

34:44.116 --> 34:46.151
Is it okay if we talk
while you dance?

34:46.185 --> 34:48.520
Yeah, whatever you like.

34:51.523 --> 34:53.091
You got a boyfriend?

34:53.125 --> 34:56.161
Yeah, a couple.

34:56.195 --> 34:58.597
I think I know
your boyfriend, actually.

34:58.630 --> 35:00.232
Frankie, right?

35:02.835 --> 35:05.370
What the fuck?

35:05.404 --> 35:06.805
- You a cop?
- No.

35:10.676 --> 35:13.445
Let me make something clear
to you people once and for all.

35:13.479 --> 35:14.746
All right?

35:14.780 --> 35:17.282
I'm at work right now.

35:17.316 --> 35:19.451
This is my job, all right?

35:19.485 --> 35:23.255
I can't take a fucking coffee
break every time one of you
assholes has a question.

35:23.288 --> 35:25.824
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
I told you. I'm not a cop.

35:25.858 --> 35:27.593
Here.

35:33.465 --> 35:36.835
You know Frankie
had two girls killed?

35:36.869 --> 35:38.537
Jesus Christ.

35:41.206 --> 35:42.641
You don't really believe that,
do you?

35:42.674 --> 35:44.209
You tell me.

35:45.544 --> 35:47.713
I don't know anything about it.

35:47.746 --> 35:50.516
And, honestly,
I wouldn't say shit if I did.

35:50.549 --> 35:52.150
Come on, you can talk to me.

35:52.184 --> 35:53.785
It's not gonna come back on you.

35:59.558 --> 36:01.693
You know what?

36:02.694 --> 36:04.396
Fuck Frankie.

36:06.498 --> 36:08.567
And fuck you.

36:08.600 --> 36:11.169
You know where he's at.
Go ask him yourself.

36:16.441 --> 36:18.911
Leave this very concentrated.

36:18.944 --> 36:23.615
Yo, the Sox are on.
Why are we watching this?

36:23.649 --> 36:25.450
'Cause she's hot.

36:25.484 --> 36:27.819
And she can cook.

36:27.853 --> 36:29.855
And fuck the Sox.

36:29.888 --> 36:31.323
You got that?

36:32.791 --> 36:35.727
Cuevas, you have a visitor.

37:27.579 --> 37:29.982
Do I know you?

37:30.015 --> 37:32.017
Mm-mm, no.

37:33.785 --> 37:35.487
How'd you get on my list?

37:37.255 --> 37:39.958
I work for the
federal government.

37:39.992 --> 37:41.960
My name is Jackie Quinones.

37:41.994 --> 37:44.563
Ah...

37:44.596 --> 37:48.000
you're the lady that's been
asking questions about me.

37:48.033 --> 37:49.267
The fish cop.

37:51.837 --> 37:54.740
How do you know all that?

37:54.773 --> 37:57.943
People like to tell me things.

37:57.976 --> 38:00.412
Someone been talking about me?
Someone who knows my job?

38:00.445 --> 38:03.281
A fisherman?

38:03.315 --> 38:04.850
Why are you here?

38:06.752 --> 38:09.888
You brought me here, Frankie.

38:09.921 --> 38:13.492
I'm the one who found Sherry
Henry on the beach,

38:13.525 --> 38:15.327
and I went kind of
crazy after that.

38:15.360 --> 38:17.496
I started looking into it,
found out it was you.

38:17.529 --> 38:21.466
I mean, that wasn't a secret.
Cops knew that shit day one.

38:21.500 --> 38:24.603
But then you had
Krista Collins killed,

38:24.636 --> 38:28.674
and I'm like,
"Who is this fucking dude?

38:28.707 --> 38:30.442
"He must have some
big old balls,

38:30.475 --> 38:32.044
killing these girls
like they're nothing."

38:35.080 --> 38:38.083
So I wanted to see you.

38:38.316 --> 38:41.019
And now that I'm here,
I see that you're nothing.

38:42.788 --> 38:46.591
You're just some little punk
sitting in a cell,

38:46.625 --> 38:48.860
sending his boys
to do his dirty work.

38:53.598 --> 38:55.967
You got a tough mouth.

38:56.001 --> 38:58.603
It would look good
wrapped around my cock.

39:00.772 --> 39:02.474
Sexual threat's kind of basic.

39:02.507 --> 39:03.675
You keep talking,
and you're gonna find out

39:03.709 --> 39:06.578
exactly what happened
to those two girls.

39:06.611 --> 39:08.547
Now, that's a threat.

39:10.515 --> 39:13.051
But here's what's gonna happen--
you're not gonna do shit to me

39:13.085 --> 39:15.387
because you are not
getting out of here.

39:15.420 --> 39:17.823
Not in five,
not in seven, not ever.

39:17.856 --> 39:20.692
I will make sure of that.

39:20.726 --> 39:22.861
You're my white whale.

39:25.831 --> 39:27.899
You don't even know
where that's from, do you,

39:27.933 --> 39:29.901
you ignorant fuck?

39:29.935 --> 39:31.870
Whatever, it doesn't matter.
Here's what's gonna happen.

39:31.903 --> 39:33.472
I'm gonna walk out of here.

39:33.505 --> 39:36.074
I'm gonna do whatever
the fuck I want.

39:36.108 --> 39:38.744
Have a nice dinner,
go on the boat,

39:38.777 --> 39:41.613
maybe eat some pussy.

39:41.646 --> 39:43.615
And then I'm gonna do
whatever I have to

39:43.648 --> 39:46.084
to make sure you spend
the rest of your life in here.

39:54.092 --> 39:57.796
By the way, I don't think
Renee's gonna wait that long.

40:12.978 --> 40:14.646
Hey, Scotty.

40:14.679 --> 40:15.747
How you feeling?

40:15.781 --> 40:17.716
Okay.

40:17.749 --> 40:19.451
Yeah?

40:19.484 --> 40:21.052
You look a little green
around the gills.

40:21.086 --> 40:23.622
You're not getting dope sick on
me, are you?

40:23.655 --> 40:25.056
No.

40:25.090 --> 40:26.625
You'll be all right.

40:26.658 --> 40:28.727
We got great a Suboxone program
in County.

40:28.760 --> 40:29.895
I think you'll be fine.

40:29.928 --> 40:31.062
What the fuck?

40:31.096 --> 40:32.998
Why am I going
to fucking County?

40:33.031 --> 40:35.767
Well, right now we have you
for possession with intent,

40:35.801 --> 40:37.569
but maybe you can
help yourself out.

40:39.971 --> 40:42.974
You know Krista Collins?

40:43.008 --> 40:44.509
Who?

40:44.543 --> 40:46.578
Uh, the girl who died
in the motel.

40:48.013 --> 40:49.815
I know a lot of people.

40:49.848 --> 40:51.883
Cut the shit, Scotty.

40:51.917 --> 40:53.919
Talk to us, or I'm gonna
release the hounds.

40:53.952 --> 40:55.453
The hounds?

40:55.487 --> 40:58.156
You live with your
grandmother, right?

40:58.190 --> 41:00.125
- Yeah.
- Talk to us,

41:00.158 --> 41:02.594
or she's gonna lose her Social
Security for housing a felon.

41:02.627 --> 41:03.929
What?
No, you can't fucking do that!

41:03.962 --> 41:05.564
Oh, I absolutely can.

41:05.597 --> 41:07.799
Scotty, no one wants
that to happen.

41:07.833 --> 41:10.635
Just don't put us
in a bad position here.

41:10.669 --> 41:13.205
C-can I have
a cranberry juice, please?

41:16.842 --> 41:17.976
Yeah.

41:23.481 --> 41:24.983
Hey, uh, Patty,

41:25.016 --> 41:27.552
can I get a cranberry juice?

41:30.589 --> 41:32.090
That'll just be a minute.

41:36.528 --> 41:38.864
Tell me about Krista.

41:52.277 --> 41:55.046
So you were saying?

41:55.080 --> 41:57.549
Okay, okay, fine.

41:57.582 --> 42:01.586
S-she copped from me,
and we partied together a little
bit.

42:01.620 --> 42:03.288
When was that?

42:03.521 --> 42:05.590
Like, three days ago.

42:05.624 --> 42:07.025
- Then what?
- I don't know.

42:07.058 --> 42:08.760
She said some shit
when she was high.

42:08.793 --> 42:12.264
She--she--she saw
her friend get capped.

42:12.297 --> 42:14.532
She was, like, traumatized.

42:18.870 --> 42:21.840
Okay, good.

42:21.873 --> 42:23.141
And who'd you tell?

42:26.177 --> 42:29.614
I-I didn't tell anyone.

42:29.648 --> 42:32.250
Someone told you about a murder
and you didn't tell anyone?

42:35.287 --> 42:38.223
I mean, uh,
I-I-I don't think so.

42:38.256 --> 42:40.558
I'm gonna be really
specific with you.

42:40.592 --> 42:41.927
Did you tell Osito

42:41.960 --> 42:44.062
there was a witness
to the murder of Sherry Henry

42:44.095 --> 42:46.064
and then tell him where
that witness was staying?

42:49.100 --> 42:50.268
No.

42:50.302 --> 42:51.970
Bullshit, man!

42:52.003 --> 42:53.138
I'm gonna go through
your cell phone,

42:53.171 --> 42:54.906
which I'm 100% allowed to do,

42:54.940 --> 42:57.742
and if there's one single call
to one single person

42:57.776 --> 42:59.611
in association
with Frankie Cuevas,

42:59.644 --> 43:01.880
I'm charging you with accessory
before the fact!

43:10.055 --> 43:11.056
That's it.
You're done.

43:11.089 --> 43:12.590
Okay, okay, wait.

43:19.064 --> 43:22.133
- You still got it, Raymond.
- Never lost it, Les.

43:25.170 --> 43:27.005
Here's what's up, man.
Krista Collins got high.

43:27.038 --> 43:28.940
Tells that little shit Scotty
she saw her friend get killed.

43:28.974 --> 43:31.343
He calls Osito,
who's in his contacts under O,

43:31.376 --> 43:34.245
tells him,
"Hey, you got a witness."

43:34.279 --> 43:37.182
Shit.

43:37.215 --> 43:38.216
Now what?

43:40.819 --> 43:42.921
Fuck it.
Bring him in.

43:42.954 --> 43:44.689
- Osito?
- Yeah.

43:44.723 --> 43:45.857
Think he's gonna flip?

43:45.890 --> 43:47.826
Only one way to find out.

43:47.859 --> 43:50.028
He's a known flight risk, man.
It's the right play.

43:51.830 --> 43:54.833
Come on, I'm sick of jerking off
to this guy.

43:54.866 --> 43:55.967
I want to fuck.

43:57.369 --> 43:59.804
Start at Kathleen's?

44:04.709 --> 44:05.677
Hey.

44:07.712 --> 44:09.014
The balls on you,

44:09.047 --> 44:11.316
calling in sick
your first day back.

44:11.349 --> 44:13.118
Yeah, I had a thing.
Is Ed around?

44:13.151 --> 44:14.285
No, he went home
to his old lady.

44:14.319 --> 44:16.955
- What's up?
- I got a question.

44:16.988 --> 44:19.924
You ever think any of
the fishermen could be dirty?

44:19.958 --> 44:21.026
Dirty how?

44:21.059 --> 44:23.895
Like, beyond the usual bullshit?

44:23.928 --> 44:25.263
No, like drug trade.

44:29.234 --> 44:31.202
The old timers,
they talk about the fleet

44:31.236 --> 44:32.904
bringing in pot back in the day,

44:32.937 --> 44:34.906
but there's all these fucking
weed stores now.

44:34.939 --> 44:36.708
You don't need
a commercial fishing vessel

44:36.741 --> 44:38.109
to bring in a couple kilos.

44:40.245 --> 44:41.813
You going back
to the office tonight?

44:41.846 --> 44:43.948
Fuck, no.
I'm three beers in.

44:45.984 --> 44:49.754
I mean, would you go
to the office with me?

45:03.768 --> 45:06.104
Damn, Kathleen's place
is fucking charming.

45:17.449 --> 45:19.784
- Can I help you?
- Yeah, hi.

45:19.818 --> 45:21.119
Sergeant Ray Abruzzo.

45:21.152 --> 45:22.487
This is Trooper Alan Saintille.

45:22.720 --> 45:25.190
Mass State Police.
We're looking for an Emanuel
Delgado.

45:25.223 --> 45:26.491
Is he here?

45:26.724 --> 45:28.359
No, I have no idea
who you're talking about.

45:31.329 --> 45:32.430
Whoa.

45:32.464 --> 45:35.767
I don't know if you know this,

45:35.800 --> 45:37.836
but, uh, you got a perfect
stranger sitting in your house.

45:37.869 --> 45:39.804
You guys can't just barge in
here like this without a
warrant.

45:39.838 --> 45:42.107
Oh, no, we don't need a warrant
to talk to him.

45:42.140 --> 45:44.342
Ain't that right, Osito?

45:44.375 --> 45:46.277
It's good to see you again.

45:46.311 --> 45:47.312
Got a few questions for you.

45:47.345 --> 45:48.813
You want to come down to the
station with us?

45:48.847 --> 45:50.915
No, he does not.

45:50.949 --> 45:52.851
You can't do that.

45:52.884 --> 45:54.085
They cops.

45:55.854 --> 45:57.388
They do whatever
the fuck they want.

46:14.305 --> 46:15.440
Uh, I'm so sorry.

46:15.473 --> 46:17.308
I'm sure he'll be
here any second.

46:17.342 --> 46:19.144
Hmm.
You know, I was kind of
surprised

46:19.177 --> 46:21.412
to hear you guys
were still together.

46:21.446 --> 46:23.314
How's he doing?

46:23.348 --> 46:24.949
What do you mean?

46:24.983 --> 46:28.786
I don't know.
I just heard he was in a bad
way.

46:31.222 --> 46:32.790
He's fine.

47:03.855 --> 47:05.156
You Junior?

47:17.869 --> 47:19.337
Hmm.

47:19.370 --> 47:21.606
Looks good.

47:21.839 --> 47:24.242
It's gonna be 500.

47:24.275 --> 47:26.511
You said 400.

47:26.544 --> 47:28.546
I changed my mind.

47:30.048 --> 47:33.184
You think you can fuck with me?

47:33.218 --> 47:34.619
Take it or leave it.

47:36.621 --> 47:39.424
You think I can't kick
your fucking ass, huh?

47:39.457 --> 47:41.960
On roids and meth, probably.

47:41.993 --> 47:44.095
Doesn't make you a man, though.

48:35.580 --> 48:37.582
Sorry I ruined date night.

48:39.584 --> 48:42.287
Kathleen seems nice.

48:42.320 --> 48:44.289
Easy on the eyes, too.

48:45.623 --> 48:47.392
You surprised by that?

48:47.425 --> 48:48.660
No.

48:48.693 --> 48:50.361
Heard you got that good dick.

48:52.230 --> 48:54.499
So it says here
you're born in the Dominican,

48:54.532 --> 48:55.667
moved here as a kid.

48:55.700 --> 48:59.003
You go back and
forth a few times?

48:59.037 --> 49:01.606
Man, the fucking Bachelor's on.

49:04.008 --> 49:05.343
All right.

49:05.376 --> 49:07.578
I'm just getting right
down to it, then.

49:07.612 --> 49:09.514
So we're working this case.
We're talking to a few people.

49:09.547 --> 49:12.183
Mostly just ruling out suspects
at this stage.

49:12.216 --> 49:15.520
Do you remember what you were
doing on August 22nd?

49:15.553 --> 49:17.188
Nope.

49:17.221 --> 49:19.324
There was a
supermoon that night.

49:19.357 --> 49:21.059
Does that jog your memory?

49:23.127 --> 49:25.129
No.

49:25.163 --> 49:27.565
You go down to Truro?

49:27.598 --> 49:29.600
Why would I do that?

49:29.634 --> 49:31.269
Is that a no?

49:37.375 --> 49:39.711
You know a girl
named Sherry Henry?

49:41.679 --> 49:43.181
No.

49:43.214 --> 49:45.683
What about a Krista Collins?

49:45.717 --> 49:48.353
Little white girl?

49:48.386 --> 49:49.587
Yeah.

49:49.620 --> 49:51.022
No.

49:53.391 --> 49:55.993
What were you doing
night before last?

49:59.397 --> 50:01.632
- Drove around some.
- With who?

50:01.666 --> 50:03.401
- My boy.
- Your boy got a name?

50:03.434 --> 50:04.435
Nope.

50:05.636 --> 50:07.271
You guys go to Bourne?

50:09.040 --> 50:11.109
I don't know the area that well.

50:11.142 --> 50:13.344
All these wack-ass towns
look the same to me.

50:15.546 --> 50:18.216
I think you guys went to Bourne.

50:19.684 --> 50:22.220
And this is a
picture of you guys

50:22.253 --> 50:24.489
crossing the bridge.

50:24.522 --> 50:27.058
Picture sucks.

50:27.091 --> 50:29.427
You can't even tell who's in it.

50:29.460 --> 50:31.562
Yeah, but we know who's in it.

50:33.097 --> 50:36.234
We know you guys went to Bourne.

50:36.267 --> 50:39.036
And we know why.

50:41.606 --> 50:44.242
Killing girls is kind of pussy,
don't you think?

50:46.677 --> 50:50.248
And then you fucked it up again.

50:52.550 --> 50:56.120
Someone told you Krista was
talking about you and Sherry
Henry.

50:56.154 --> 50:58.089
And we got a witness
that puts you

50:58.122 --> 51:00.091
in Krista Collins' room
around midnight.

51:00.124 --> 51:02.427
So there's motive
and opportunity.

51:04.262 --> 51:08.599
And you think this fucking kid
ain't gonna flip on you?

51:10.802 --> 51:14.772
This is your chance,
'cause it's either you or him.

51:19.110 --> 51:21.245
I'll help you out.

51:21.279 --> 51:23.281
I'll talk to the DA for you,

51:23.314 --> 51:26.784
because I know
you didn't do this on your own.

51:26.818 --> 51:29.287
Frankie commissioned both hits.

51:30.822 --> 51:33.391
Come on, Osito.

51:33.424 --> 51:35.460
Talk to me.
Let's make a deal.

51:45.369 --> 51:47.538
What are you, fucking deaf?

51:47.572 --> 51:51.242
Hey, I'm fucking talking to you.

51:54.278 --> 51:56.147
You're gonna stand
tall for Frankie,

51:56.180 --> 51:57.315
you're gonna spend the rest
of your fucking life

51:57.348 --> 52:00.384
in this cold-ass state
and fucking die in prison.

52:00.418 --> 52:02.887
But if you talk to me,

52:03.120 --> 52:05.556
you can go back to the DR
and see your family again.

52:05.590 --> 52:07.191
Now, the choice is yours.

52:10.661 --> 52:12.463
Ticktock, motherfucker.

52:22.406 --> 52:24.242
Okay.

52:25.910 --> 52:29.580
I'm gonna be honest with you.

52:29.614 --> 52:30.915
Tell you the real true.

52:39.257 --> 52:41.559
You know that girl Kathleen?

52:43.427 --> 52:45.296
She's way out of my league.

52:46.864 --> 52:49.300
You know it, I know it,

52:49.333 --> 52:51.569
but that's bae.

52:51.602 --> 52:55.339
I fucking love that girl.

52:55.373 --> 52:59.176
Only thing about Kathleen is...

52:59.210 --> 53:01.345
she not that smart.

53:01.379 --> 53:05.216
I mean, for real.
She gets lost going to the Stop
& Shop.

53:05.249 --> 53:07.919
But that's okay, though.

53:07.952 --> 53:10.588
She might not know much.

53:10.621 --> 53:13.724
She might be half a dummy,

53:13.758 --> 53:15.893
but she knows enough
to call my lawyer

53:15.927 --> 53:17.562
if I ever get pinched.

53:20.698 --> 53:22.667
So...

53:25.703 --> 53:29.774
I'm not talking
till he gets here, Ray.

53:41.986 --> 53:43.921
What the fuck was that?

53:43.955 --> 53:45.890
I got him.

53:45.923 --> 53:47.525
You got shit.

53:47.558 --> 53:49.226
You got played.

53:49.260 --> 53:50.661
Lie is just as
good as the truth.

53:50.695 --> 53:52.730
He didn't even lie to you.
He lawyered up.

53:52.763 --> 53:54.298
No, no, no,
he said he was never in Truro.

53:54.332 --> 53:56.300
- Come on.
- We place him there.

53:56.334 --> 53:57.335
How?

53:57.368 --> 53:58.803
You get the DA to
set up a drug wire,

53:58.836 --> 54:00.004
we tickle the wire long enough,

54:00.237 --> 54:02.540
draw out the accomplice,
catch him in the lie.

54:02.573 --> 54:04.709
We got him.
We fucking got him.

54:04.742 --> 54:06.243
Don't bullshit a bullshitter.

54:06.277 --> 54:09.780
You know and I know
you didn't get shit.

54:09.814 --> 54:11.816
Nice try, though.

54:16.754 --> 54:19.323
This motherfucker right here.

54:21.959 --> 54:24.495
Looks like we need to find
ourselves a white boy and flip
him.

54:28.332 --> 54:30.434
- Is that it?
- Yes.

54:30.468 --> 54:32.737
Oh, no, no, it's the log
for the whole month of August.

54:32.770 --> 54:34.572
Okay, just--just do
that Thursday.

54:34.605 --> 54:35.873
- I'm trying.
- Let me do it.

54:35.906 --> 54:36.907
No, no.

54:36.941 --> 54:38.576
The database is only
for senior agents.

54:38.609 --> 54:39.977
Wait, you're giving me
the info anyway.

54:40.011 --> 54:41.812
Plausible deniability--
I don't know what happens

54:41.846 --> 54:43.414
to a printout I
leave on my desk.

54:43.447 --> 54:46.484
Oh, my God.

54:46.517 --> 54:48.786
I just need the boats that went
out the night of the supermoon.

54:48.819 --> 54:50.888
That's what I'm doing.

54:54.992 --> 54:56.427
Oh, fuck.

54:56.460 --> 54:57.795
What do you want?
It's a government website.

54:57.828 --> 54:59.363
So...

54:59.397 --> 55:01.866
can we discuss the terms
and conditions of this favor?

55:03.634 --> 55:05.503
I'll buy you dinner.

55:05.536 --> 55:07.538
You buy me dinner,
and you let me sleep over again.

55:07.571 --> 55:09.306
I'm downgrading my offer
to a drink.

55:09.340 --> 55:11.308
Okay, fine, you buy me dinner,
no sleepover.

55:11.342 --> 55:13.811
One drink, and I don't tell
anybody that your junk

55:13.844 --> 55:16.681
looks like an oyster
on the half shell.

55:16.714 --> 55:18.082
Okay, fine.
One drink.

55:18.315 --> 55:19.684
Let's go now while
this thing loads.

55:19.717 --> 55:21.052
I meant I'd buy you
a drink sometime.

55:21.085 --> 55:22.386
Jesus fucking Christ.

55:22.420 --> 55:23.854
You remind me of my ex-wife.
You know that?

55:24.989 --> 55:25.956
Yes!

55:25.990 --> 55:28.059
Victory in our time.

55:33.464 --> 55:36.067
Here we are--
Thursday, August 22nd.

55:36.100 --> 55:38.869
Looks like
40-something fishing boats

55:38.903 --> 55:40.538
went out across the Cape,
three at night.

55:40.571 --> 55:42.573
- Any of them come back?
- One.

55:42.606 --> 55:44.008
Went from P-Town
to Truro and back.

55:44.041 --> 55:45.509
Let me see.

55:48.512 --> 55:50.481
Time in...

55:59.924 --> 56:01.992
You ready?
