WEBVTT

00:02.711 --> 00:04.878
Would you let it go?
It's not a big deal.

00:05.130 --> 00:06.880
Not a big deal?
It's amazing.

00:07.132 --> 00:10.009
You just reach in, there's one
little maneuver, and bam!

00:10.218 --> 00:12.428
A bra. Right out the sleeve.

00:12.846 --> 00:14.179
As far as I'm concerned...

00:14.431 --> 00:17.683
...there is nothing a guy can do
that comes close. Right?

00:17.934 --> 00:20.894
Come on!
You guys can pee standing up.

00:21.146 --> 00:23.355
We can? Okay, I'm trying that.

00:25.150 --> 00:26.692
You know what blows my mind?

00:26.901 --> 00:30.154
Women can see breasts
anytime they want.

00:32.365 --> 00:34.533
You just look down,
and there they are.

00:34.743 --> 00:37.286
How you get any work done
is beyond me.

00:38.788 --> 00:42.291
What I don't get is the way
guys can do so many mean things...

00:42.500 --> 00:43.917
...and then not even care.

00:50.800 --> 00:52.926
Multiple orgasms!

01:48.733 --> 01:50.526
So Saturday night, the big night.

01:50.777 --> 01:53.904
Date night!
Saturday night. Saturday night!

01:55.990 --> 01:58.283
- No plans, huh?
- Not a one.

01:59.410 --> 02:01.328
Not even, say,
breaking up with Janice?

02:01.579 --> 02:03.831
Oh, right, right. Shut up.

02:05.667 --> 02:08.460
Chandler, nobody likes
breaking up with someone.

02:08.752 --> 02:12.297
- You just gotta do it.
- I know. But it's just so hard.

02:12.549 --> 02:15.509
You're sitting with her.
She has no idea what's happening.

02:15.760 --> 02:18.220
You finally get up
the courage to do it.

02:18.471 --> 02:21.765
There's that awkward moment
when you've handed her the note.

02:25.478 --> 02:27.729
Why do you have to break up with her?

02:27.939 --> 02:30.566
Be a man. Just stop calling.

02:33.153 --> 02:35.112
If you want, I'll do it with you.

02:35.655 --> 02:38.991
Thanks, but she'd feel like
we were ganging up on her.

02:39.242 --> 02:41.869
I mean you break up with Janice.
I'll break up with Tony.

02:42.120 --> 02:43.537
You're breaking up with Tony?

02:43.788 --> 02:46.456
I know. He's sweet, but it's just
not fun anymore.

02:46.708 --> 02:50.002
I don't know if it's me or
his hunger strike. I don't know.

02:52.380 --> 02:53.881
Does anybody want anything else?

02:54.132 --> 02:58.635
Yeah. Last week you had a wonderful nutty,
chocolate-y, kind of cake-y pie thing that...

03:00.221 --> 03:01.805
Nothing. I'm fine.

03:04.434 --> 03:06.393
What's the matter?
Why so scrunchie?

03:07.020 --> 03:10.063
It's my father. He wants to give me
a Mercedes convertible.

03:11.149 --> 03:14.193
That guy, he burns me up.

03:14.736 --> 03:17.779
Yeah, well, it's a Mercedes
if I move back home.

03:18.031 --> 03:20.949
It was horrible!
He called me "young lady."

03:21.201 --> 03:23.577
Ooh, I hate when my father
calls me that.

03:24.704 --> 03:27.956
Did he give you that whole
"You're not up to this" thing again?

03:28.166 --> 03:31.168
Yeah, I got the extended disco
version with three choruses of:

03:31.377 --> 03:33.253
"You'll never make it on your own."

03:33.504 --> 03:34.796
Uh-huh, uh-huh

03:38.343 --> 03:39.843
Hi, Joey.

03:41.095 --> 03:42.262
Oh, my God. Angela.

03:42.472 --> 03:45.682
Wow. Being dumped by you
obviously agrees with her.

03:45.934 --> 03:47.809
- Are you gonna go over there?
- No.

03:48.603 --> 03:50.103
Yeah. No.

03:51.314 --> 03:54.233
Okay, but not yet.
I don't wanna seem too eager.

03:57.237 --> 03:59.863
One Mississippi, two Mississippi...

04:00.281 --> 04:02.324
...three Mississippi.
That seems pretty cool.

04:06.704 --> 04:07.955
Hey, Angela.

04:08.164 --> 04:09.248
Joey.

04:09.499 --> 04:10.707
You look good.

04:11.209 --> 04:14.253
Because I'm wearing a dress
that accents my boobs.

04:21.803 --> 04:22.970
You don't say.

04:24.847 --> 04:27.432
So, Rachel, what are you
doing tonight?

04:27.684 --> 04:30.727
Big glamour night.
Me and Monica at Launderama.

04:30.937 --> 04:32.062
Oh.

04:32.772 --> 04:36.149
You wanna hear a freakish coincidence?

04:36.359 --> 04:38.193
Guess who's doing laundry there too?

04:38.945 --> 04:40.362
- Who?
- Me.

04:41.155 --> 04:42.990
Was that not clear?

04:46.369 --> 04:47.661
Hey, why don't...?

04:47.870 --> 04:50.998
Why don't I just
join you both there?

04:51.207 --> 04:53.667
Don't you have a laundry room
in your building?

04:55.336 --> 04:56.378
Yes.

04:57.714 --> 05:00.549
I do have a laundry room
in my building.

05:02.552 --> 05:05.262
Um... But there's a rat problem.

05:05.513 --> 05:08.724
Apparently, they're attracted to
the dryer sheets.

05:08.933 --> 05:11.810
They're going in fine,
but they're coming out all...

05:12.520 --> 05:13.603
...fluffy.

05:16.649 --> 05:17.691
Anyway, 7-ish?

05:18.026 --> 05:19.067
Sure.

05:22.238 --> 05:24.323
Forget it, Joey.
I'm with Bob now.

05:24.532 --> 05:26.867
Bob? Who the hell's Bob?

05:27.118 --> 05:28.493
Bob is great.

05:28.703 --> 05:31.872
He's smart, he's sophisticated,
and he has a real job.

05:32.123 --> 05:36.043
You go on three auditions a month
and you call yourself an actor. But Bob...

05:36.252 --> 05:39.296
Come on. We were great together.

05:39.547 --> 05:43.925
And not just at the fun stuff,
but, like, talking too.

05:47.305 --> 05:50.098
Sorry, Joey. You said,
"Let's just be friends."

05:50.350 --> 05:51.808
So guess what?

05:52.018 --> 05:54.144
- What?
- We're just friends.

05:54.645 --> 05:56.063
Fine. Fine.

05:56.314 --> 06:00.067
So why don't the four of us go out and
have dinner tonight? You know, as friends.

06:00.318 --> 06:01.651
What "four of us"?

06:01.903 --> 06:05.364
You and Bob,
and me and my girlfriend, um...

06:07.116 --> 06:08.158
...Monica.

06:08.368 --> 06:11.286
Monica, I'm telling you, this guy
is perfect for you.

06:11.496 --> 06:15.290
Forget it! Not after your cousin
who could belch the alphabet.

06:16.209 --> 06:20.045
Come on, this guy's great.
His name's Bob. He's Angela's...

06:20.296 --> 06:21.421
...ahem, brother.

06:21.631 --> 06:23.673
He's smart, he's sophisticated...

06:23.925 --> 06:25.675
...and he has a real job.

06:25.927 --> 06:29.846
Me, I go on three auditions a month
and call myself an actor, but Bob is...

06:30.098 --> 06:31.681
- Oh, God, help us.
- What?

06:31.891 --> 06:34.267
Ugly Naked Guy is laying kitchen tile.

06:36.020 --> 06:37.646
Ew!

06:38.147 --> 06:40.649
Look, I'm asking a favor here.

06:40.858 --> 06:43.360
I'm thinking if I do this
for her brother...

06:43.611 --> 06:45.445
...maybe Angela will come back to me.

06:45.696 --> 06:48.990
What's going on here?
You go out with tons of girls.

06:49.200 --> 06:50.659
I know, but...

06:52.620 --> 06:57.124
Look, I made a huge mistake.
I never should've broke up with her.

06:57.333 --> 06:59.668
Will you help me? Please?

07:06.050 --> 07:07.926
Okay. Bye.

07:08.803 --> 07:12.389
Monica's not coming.
It's just gonna be me and Rachel.

07:13.766 --> 07:16.852
Hold on there, camper.
You sure you've thought this through?

07:17.103 --> 07:20.272
It's laundry. The thinking
through is pretty minimal.

07:21.399 --> 07:23.525
It's just you and Rachel?
Just the two of you?

07:23.776 --> 07:26.027
This is a date.
You're going on a date.

07:27.864 --> 07:28.989
Nuh-uh.

07:31.325 --> 07:32.576
Yeah-huh.

07:33.703 --> 07:34.870
What are you saying?

07:35.121 --> 07:37.539
I should shave again?
Pick up some wine? What?

07:37.790 --> 07:41.126
Well, you may wanna rethink
the dirty underwear.

07:42.420 --> 07:46.548
It's the first time she'll see your
underwear. You want it to be dirty?

07:50.887 --> 07:52.179
No.

07:53.639 --> 07:55.807
And the fabric softener?

07:56.017 --> 07:58.810
Okay, okay.
Now, what is wrong with my Snuggles?

08:00.396 --> 08:04.065
What? It says I'm a sensitive,
warm kind of guy.

08:04.317 --> 08:06.776
You know, like a little fuzzy bear.

08:08.946 --> 08:11.364
I can pick something else
up on the way.

08:16.078 --> 08:17.078
Thank you.

08:17.288 --> 08:20.499
So what does this Bob guy
look like? Is he tall, short?

08:21.125 --> 08:22.626
Yep.

08:23.419 --> 08:24.461
Which?

08:24.921 --> 08:26.171
Which what?

08:27.673 --> 08:29.799
You've never met Bob, have you?

08:30.009 --> 08:31.092
No, but...

08:31.344 --> 08:33.720
For all we know,
he could be horribly...

08:35.806 --> 08:39.100
Horribly attractive.
I'll be shutting up now.

08:44.148 --> 08:46.399
Where are they? Where are they?

08:46.609 --> 08:49.945
This is nice. We never
do anything, just the two of us.

08:50.571 --> 08:54.741
That's great. Maybe tomorrow we can
rent a car, run over some puppies.

08:54.951 --> 08:56.493
Ew. I don't wanna do that.

08:59.247 --> 09:01.998
- Here we go.
- Have a good breakup.

09:03.751 --> 09:07.379
- Hey, Janice.
- My God, I am so glad you called me.

09:07.588 --> 09:10.840
I had the most supremely awful day.

09:12.134 --> 09:13.468
That's not good.

09:14.929 --> 09:17.889
Can I get an espresso
and a latte over here, please?

09:18.140 --> 09:21.059
We got the proofs from that
photo shoot with the vegetables.

09:21.310 --> 09:22.352
They sucked.

09:22.562 --> 09:25.564
I blew off the rest of the afternoon.
I went shopping.

09:25.815 --> 09:28.733
And I got you...

09:28.985 --> 09:31.945
I'm looking. I'm looking.

09:32.363 --> 09:34.489
I'm looking.

09:35.199 --> 09:36.491
- I got you...
- What?

09:36.701 --> 09:40.412
- What?
- What did you get me there?

09:40.705 --> 09:43.123
I got you...

09:43.624 --> 09:45.000
...these.

09:45.835 --> 09:47.752
Bullwinkle socks.

09:48.004 --> 09:50.380
- That's so sweet.
- I knew you had the Rockys.

09:50.631 --> 09:52.716
So you could wear
Bullwinkle and Bullwinkle...

09:52.967 --> 09:56.052
...or wear Rocky and Rocky,
or you can mix and match.

09:56.262 --> 09:58.138
Moose and squirrel.

09:58.347 --> 10:00.223
Whatever you want.

10:04.270 --> 10:06.938
I'm gonna get another espresso.
More latte?

10:08.482 --> 10:09.691
No.

10:10.067 --> 10:13.153
No, I'm still working on mine.

10:17.783 --> 10:18.825
That's it?

10:19.076 --> 10:20.493
Yeah, it was really hard.

10:20.953 --> 10:22.871
Yeah, the hug looked pretty brutal.

10:23.539 --> 10:24.831
Okay, you weren't there.

10:37.720 --> 10:40.055
Coming through! Move! Move!

10:45.269 --> 10:48.647
Excuse me! I was kind of
using that machine.

10:48.898 --> 10:51.316
Yeah, well, now you're kind of not.

10:52.526 --> 10:55.403
But I saved it.
I put my basket on top.

10:55.655 --> 10:58.114
- I'm sorry. Is that your basket?
- Yes.

10:58.366 --> 11:01.368
It's really pretty.
Unfortunately, I don't see suds!

11:03.913 --> 11:04.954
What?

11:06.123 --> 11:09.292
No suds, no save, okay?

11:12.171 --> 11:13.630
- What's going on?
- Hi.

11:13.839 --> 11:17.592
Nothing. This horrible woman
just took my machine.

11:17.885 --> 11:19.344
Was your basket on top?

11:19.595 --> 11:21.805
- Yeah, but there were no suds.
- So?

11:22.056 --> 11:23.556
You know, no suds, no save.

11:23.808 --> 11:25.767
No suds, no... Excuse me.

11:26.018 --> 11:27.602
Hold on a second!

11:27.812 --> 11:29.979
This is my friend's machine.

11:30.231 --> 11:32.399
Hey, hey, hey!
Her stuff wasn't in it!

11:32.650 --> 11:36.653
Hey, hey, hey! That's not
the rule, and you know it!

11:47.164 --> 11:48.707
All right. Show's over.

11:51.669 --> 11:53.878
Nothing to see here.

11:56.298 --> 11:58.466
Okay. Let's do laundry.

11:58.676 --> 12:02.470
That was amazing!
I can't even send back soup.

12:02.722 --> 12:07.225
Well, that's because you're
such a sweet, gentle...

12:09.562 --> 12:10.729
Do you, uh?

12:10.938 --> 12:13.440
Oh, hey. You must need detergent.

12:17.403 --> 12:19.362
- What's that?
- Überweiss.

12:20.322 --> 12:23.450
It's new. It's German.
It's extra tough!

12:25.536 --> 12:27.746
Rach, do you...?
Are you gonna separate those?

12:29.331 --> 12:31.332
Oh, God. Ugh.

12:31.584 --> 12:33.960
Am I being like a total laundry spaz?

12:34.211 --> 12:38.047
Am I supposed to use one machine
for shirts and another for pants?

12:41.594 --> 12:44.679
Have you...?
Have you never done this before?

12:44.930 --> 12:48.057
Well, not myself.
But I know other people that have.

12:49.852 --> 12:52.896
Okay. You caught me.
I'm a laundry virgin.

12:54.565 --> 12:57.609
Don't worry.
I'll use the gentle cycle.

12:59.904 --> 13:00.987
Okay...

13:02.364 --> 13:05.950
Basically, you wanna use
one machine for all your whites.

13:06.160 --> 13:07.160
Whites. Okay.

13:07.369 --> 13:09.662
- A whole other machine for your colors.
- Colors.

13:09.872 --> 13:12.707
And then a third for your, uh...

13:14.668 --> 13:17.337
...delicates.
And that would be your bras...

13:17.588 --> 13:20.840
...and your underpanty things.

13:23.010 --> 13:26.054
Okay, well,
these are white cotton panties.

13:26.263 --> 13:28.765
Would they go with whites
or with delicates?

13:29.391 --> 13:31.476
That would be a judgment call.

13:36.649 --> 13:38.441
He's so cute!

13:40.361 --> 13:42.070
So where did you guys grow up?

13:42.321 --> 13:44.364
- Brooklyn Heights.
- Cleveland.

13:44.573 --> 13:45.782
Ha. Heh, heh, heh.

13:46.033 --> 13:47.826
- How did that happen?
- Oh, my God!

13:48.202 --> 13:49.619
What?

13:50.120 --> 13:52.372
I suddenly had the feeling I was...

13:52.623 --> 13:54.207
...falling.

13:55.543 --> 13:56.584
But I'm not.

14:06.887 --> 14:09.055
So you and Angela, huh?

14:09.306 --> 14:11.516
Yep. Pretty much.

14:11.934 --> 14:13.393
- You're a lucky man.
- Yeah.

14:14.520 --> 14:16.563
You know what I miss
the most about her?

14:16.814 --> 14:20.066
That cute nibbley noise
she makes when she eats.

14:20.276 --> 14:23.361
Like a happy little squirrel...

14:24.029 --> 14:25.697
...or a weasel.

14:27.116 --> 14:28.533
I never really noticed.

14:28.742 --> 14:31.160
Oh, yeah, yeah. Listen for it.

14:32.037 --> 14:34.038
Monica. Monica is great.

14:34.290 --> 14:36.541
Yeah. Yeah, she is.

14:36.792 --> 14:38.960
But it's not gonna last.

14:40.671 --> 14:43.006
She's too much for me in bed.

14:44.216 --> 14:45.258
Sexually.

14:48.929 --> 14:51.806
I've gotta tell you, Bob is terrific.

14:52.057 --> 14:53.349
Yeah, isn't he?

14:53.601 --> 14:56.477
It's so great to meet a guy
who's smart and funny...

14:56.729 --> 14:59.063
...and has an emotional age beyond 8.

14:59.315 --> 15:02.817
You know what else?
He's unbelievable in bed!

15:05.029 --> 15:06.237
Wow!

15:06.989 --> 15:10.033
My brother never even told me
when he lost his virginity.

15:11.452 --> 15:12.493
Huh.

15:13.203 --> 15:14.454
That's nice.

15:19.710 --> 15:22.670
You can do this. It's like
pulling off a Band-Aid.

15:22.922 --> 15:26.925
Just do it really fast,
and then the wound is exposed.

15:27.176 --> 15:28.676
Go! Go!

15:37.227 --> 15:38.770
Janice...

15:41.607 --> 15:42.732
Hi, Janice.

15:44.276 --> 15:47.820
Okay, here we go.
I don't think we should go out anymore.

15:50.658 --> 15:51.866
Janice.

15:55.245 --> 15:56.621
All right.

15:59.166 --> 16:00.333
Well...

16:01.293 --> 16:03.086
Well, there you go.

16:03.879 --> 16:05.505
Stop it, stop it, stop it.

16:10.135 --> 16:13.304
Okay, I know this is gonna sound
really stupid...

16:13.555 --> 16:15.807
...but I feel that if I can do this...

16:16.058 --> 16:18.935
...if I can actually do
my own laundry...

16:19.144 --> 16:21.020
...there isn't anything I can't do.

16:21.981 --> 16:24.357
That does not sound stupid to me.

16:24.566 --> 16:28.653
No, it's like... The first time I had to make
dinner for myself after Carol left me...

16:30.072 --> 16:32.949
I'm sorry, that's all the time
we have. Next on Ross...

16:34.535 --> 16:35.535
Okay.

16:35.744 --> 16:36.953
- Uh-oh.
- What, "uh-oh"?

16:37.204 --> 16:38.329
Uh-oh...

16:38.539 --> 16:41.457
Uh-oh, the laundry's done.

16:42.960 --> 16:44.627
It's a song.

16:44.878 --> 16:46.713
The laundry song that we sing.

16:47.756 --> 16:51.092
Uh-oh, the laundry's done

16:51.927 --> 16:52.969
What's the matter?

16:53.220 --> 16:54.303
Nothing. Nothing.

16:54.555 --> 16:55.888
The laundry's done

16:56.140 --> 16:57.223
Come on, show me.

16:57.474 --> 17:01.561
It's just that you left a red sock
in with your whites, and now...

17:04.272 --> 17:07.400
...everything's kind of pink.
- Oh.

17:07.943 --> 17:09.318
Everything's pink?

17:09.569 --> 17:12.320
Except for the red sock,
which is still red.

17:12.781 --> 17:15.282
Don't be upset.
It can happen to anyone.

17:15.534 --> 17:17.410
But it didn't.
It happened to me.

17:17.661 --> 17:21.247
God, I'm gonna look like
a big Marshmallow Peep!

17:21.457 --> 17:23.290
What am I doing? What am I doing?

17:23.541 --> 17:26.711
My father's right!
I can't live on my own.

17:26.920 --> 17:29.422
I can't even do laundry!

17:40.934 --> 17:42.810
Something went wrong
with Underdog...

17:43.062 --> 17:45.271
...and they couldn't get
his head to inflate.

17:46.607 --> 17:48.191
So anyway...

17:49.443 --> 17:52.236
...his head is, like,
flopping down Broadway.

17:53.363 --> 17:54.447
And I'm thinking...

17:55.657 --> 17:58.409
...how inappropriate this is.

17:58.786 --> 18:02.789
I've got something's in my eye.
Joey, could we check it in the light, please?

18:06.126 --> 18:07.543
- Oh, my God!
- What?

18:07.795 --> 18:10.505
Hello! Were we at
the same table? It's like...

18:10.714 --> 18:13.007
...cocktails in Appalachia.

18:17.513 --> 18:21.682
- Come on, they're close.
- Close? She's got her tongue in his ear.

18:22.476 --> 18:26.479
Like you've never got a little
rambunctious with Ross.

18:27.689 --> 18:31.400
Joey, this is sick.
It's disgusting. It's...

18:32.236 --> 18:33.903
...not really true, is it?

18:34.154 --> 18:35.822
Who's to say what's true?

18:36.073 --> 18:37.156
What were you thinking?

18:37.407 --> 18:39.951
Look, I'm not proud of this, okay?

18:40.202 --> 18:41.619
Well, maybe I am a little.

18:41.829 --> 18:43.496
- Oh.
- Ow!

18:43.705 --> 18:45.581
- I'm out of here!
- Wait! Come on!

18:45.791 --> 18:47.667
You like him. I want her.

18:47.918 --> 18:49.335
He likes you.

18:50.129 --> 18:52.004
- Really?
- Yeah.

18:52.256 --> 18:55.967
I'm thinking, if we put our heads
together, between the two of us...

18:56.176 --> 18:58.261
...we can break them up.

19:01.098 --> 19:03.516
I'm so sorry.
I can't believe I did this.

19:03.767 --> 19:07.228
I just couldn't stop laughing
at your Norman Mailer story.

19:13.569 --> 19:16.821
Waiter? One more plate of
chicken wings over here.

19:23.036 --> 19:25.496
Here's the thing.
It's like we're different.

19:25.747 --> 19:27.707
I'm the bing, you're the boom...

19:27.958 --> 19:29.000
- Ow!
- Oh!

19:29.209 --> 19:30.543
- Oh, my God!
- Ow!

19:30.752 --> 19:31.794
- I'm so sorry!
- Ow!

19:32.254 --> 19:33.629
- Are you okay?
- Ow!

19:34.840 --> 19:36.883
It's just my lens. It's my lens.

19:37.676 --> 19:39.135
I'll be right back.

19:41.513 --> 19:43.848
I hit her in the eye!
I hit her in the eye!

19:44.099 --> 19:47.602
This is the worst breakup
in the history of the world!

19:47.853 --> 19:49.604
Oh, my God.

19:51.732 --> 19:53.191
How many of those have you had?

19:53.442 --> 19:55.610
I don't know. A million!

19:56.486 --> 19:59.739
Chandler, shh, shh. Easy, easy.
Go to your happy place.

20:00.032 --> 20:02.158
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

20:03.285 --> 20:05.661
- I'm fine, I'm fine.
- All right.

20:05.871 --> 20:07.705
I'm not fine. Here she comes.

20:07.915 --> 20:09.749
Wait here, okay? Breathe.

20:28.727 --> 20:30.061
How do you do that?

20:30.312 --> 20:32.355
It's like a gift.

20:35.025 --> 20:37.360
We should always, always break up
together.

20:37.611 --> 20:38.736
I'd like that.

20:40.864 --> 20:43.991
You got the clothes clean.
That's the important part.

20:44.201 --> 20:47.578
I guess. Except everything
looks like jammies now.

20:53.252 --> 20:54.669
Whoa, I'm sorry.

20:54.920 --> 20:57.421
Excuse me. We had this cart.

20:58.131 --> 21:00.841
I had a 24-inch waist.
You lose things.

21:01.051 --> 21:03.344
Now, come on.
Get out of my way.

21:03.595 --> 21:07.223
I'm sorry. Maybe I wasn't
being clear. This was our cart.

21:07.516 --> 21:09.475
Hey, hey, hey.
There aren't any clothes in it!

21:09.726 --> 21:12.311
Hey, hey, hey!
Quit making up rules!

21:12.562 --> 21:15.940
Let go! Come on, this is my cart.
You know I saw it first.

21:16.191 --> 21:18.401
Listen, Mitzi, if you
want this cart...

21:18.610 --> 21:21.153
...you're gonna have to
take me with it!

21:28.453 --> 21:30.329
Yes! Did you see that?

21:30.580 --> 21:31.789
You were incredible.

21:31.999 --> 21:34.500
A brand-new woman,
ladies and gentlemen.

21:34.710 --> 21:37.086
I could not have
done this without you.

21:43.468 --> 21:44.677
Okay, um...

21:44.886 --> 21:47.805
Uh... More clothes in the dryer?

21:50.058 --> 21:52.184
- I'm fine. I'm fine.
- Are you sure?

21:55.897 --> 21:58.190
- Are you sure you're okay?
- Yeah.

21:58.483 --> 22:00.484
- Does it still hurt?
- Yeah.

22:03.113 --> 22:06.949
What a neat idea. All your
clothes match. I'm gonna do this.

22:08.744 --> 22:09.744
Hi!

22:09.953 --> 22:10.995
How'd it go?

22:11.204 --> 22:12.246
Excellent!

22:12.497 --> 22:16.751
We ripped that couple apart
and kept the pieces for ourselves.

22:18.003 --> 22:19.337
What a beautiful story.

22:21.840 --> 22:23.090
I'm fine, by the way.

22:23.342 --> 22:24.675
I'm sorry.

22:25.177 --> 22:28.095
- Where's Chandler?
- He needed some time to grieve.

22:28.347 --> 22:30.598
I'm free! I'm free!

22:32.684 --> 22:34.268
That ought to do it.
