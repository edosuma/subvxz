00:00.965 --> 00:03.299
I'm Margaret Schroeder,
Teddy's mother.

00:03.333 --> 00:05.535
He was playing with matches

00:05.569 --> 00:08.404
in a school full of children.

00:08.438 --> 00:10.139
<i>In my eight years</i>
<i>as a prosecutor</i>

00:10.173 --> 00:12.474
I have never seen a more blatant
example of witness tampering.

00:12.508 --> 00:15.544
- Objection. - The defense
motion for mistrial is granted.

00:15.578 --> 00:18.180
- This case is dismissed without
prejudice. - 

00:18.214 --> 00:20.716
Already New Year's back home.

00:20.751 --> 00:23.086
Give my best to Katy.

00:25.456 --> 00:27.624
The payment
is placed in the bowl,

00:27.658 --> 00:30.828
<i>the client leaves,</i>
<i>no one has seen anybody.</i>

00:30.862 --> 00:32.729
What is going on with
Smith and Daugherty?

00:32.764 --> 00:35.432
That would be
another conversation.

00:35.467 --> 00:37.001
What would that cost?

00:37.035 --> 00:38.936
Your costs exceed your revenue.

00:38.970 --> 00:41.739
- Every business takes time.
- Don't you have a partner?

00:41.773 --> 00:45.042
Mr. Luciano and I differ
on how the club should be run.

00:45.077 --> 00:46.344
Then you have to resolve that.

00:46.378 --> 00:47.812
I can't keep track
of the money.

00:47.846 --> 00:50.081
I don't remember who I lied to
or what lies I told them.

00:50.116 --> 00:53.017
Your adversaries claim you're not
putting bootleggers in jail.

00:53.052 --> 00:55.053
Tell Mr. Daugherty
to put one in jail.

00:55.087 --> 00:56.988
- For Mr. Rosetti.
- I'll take it.

00:57.023 --> 00:58.957
Suit yourself.

01:05.699 --> 01:07.233
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

02:53.314 --> 02:55.148
Is something wrong?

02:55.182 --> 02:58.852
- There's a fire.
- What?

03:05.126 --> 03:07.728
Go to your sister.

03:10.065 --> 03:12.333
<i>Another couple of buckets</i>
<i>of water over here.</i>

03:12.367 --> 03:15.503
<i>Watch your step.</i>
<i>It's a mess over there.</i>

03:15.537 --> 03:16.938
You needn't have come over.

03:16.972 --> 03:20.508
I could hardly sleep
with all the to-do.

03:22.010 --> 03:24.846
Was there anything
important inside?

03:24.880 --> 03:26.548
I've no idea.

03:26.582 --> 03:28.584
I never go in there.

03:28.618 --> 03:30.153
<i>All right,</i>
<i>the back looks good.</i>

03:30.187 --> 03:32.155
<i>I think everything's</i>
<i>out there.</i>

03:32.189 --> 03:34.324
Do I look ridiculous?

03:34.359 --> 03:35.926
Well, I think we both do.

03:35.960 --> 03:38.862
I've looked around.
Nothing's out of sorts.

03:38.897 --> 03:40.864
Did you think it might be?

03:40.899 --> 03:42.833
Well, better to
make sure, isn't it?

03:42.867 --> 03:46.002
Well, compost can
spontaneously combust.

03:46.037 --> 03:48.772
How'd you come to know
that, Miss Predock?

03:49.741 --> 03:52.742
It's just an odd fact, really.

03:52.777 --> 03:55.012
Was there compost in there?

03:55.046 --> 03:57.014
I haven't the slightest idea.

03:57.048 --> 04:00.550
Whatever started it,
it burned fast.

04:01.486 --> 04:03.087
Oily rags?

04:10.195 --> 04:14.532
Well, young sir,
what did you see?

04:14.566 --> 04:17.368
- The fire starting.
- And before that, though?

04:17.402 --> 04:19.170
Nothing.

04:19.204 --> 04:22.807
But if you saw
the fire starting,

04:22.841 --> 04:24.909
you were already awake.

04:26.344 --> 04:28.179
I was looking for the man.

04:28.213 --> 04:29.780
What man?

04:29.848 --> 04:31.315
The gypsy.

04:31.350 --> 04:33.751
- What are you talking about?
- He was here.

04:33.785 --> 04:37.154
- In the garden?
- In the street this morning.

04:38.190 --> 04:39.924
How do you know he was a gypsy?

04:39.958 --> 04:41.358
<i>He had his bag</i>
<i>with him</i>

04:41.393 --> 04:43.027
for his gypsy things.

04:43.061 --> 04:44.862
<i>What was he doing?</i>

04:44.896 --> 04:46.430
Walking by the house.

04:46.464 --> 04:50.033
Did you see him again tonight?

04:54.672 --> 04:56.105
Time to get back to bed.

04:56.140 --> 05:00.076
- Can't I stay up?
- Enough adventures for one day.

05:04.382 --> 05:06.449
Off you go now.

05:12.857 --> 05:14.190
A man?

05:14.225 --> 05:17.094
That he saw in the
morning on the street.

05:17.128 --> 05:18.729
I wouldn't make too much of it.

05:18.797 --> 05:22.165
- <i>Then why is Gareth here?</i>
- Precaution.

05:22.200 --> 05:25.569
And precaution brought you
here at 2:00 in the morning?

05:25.603 --> 05:28.105
Perhaps I wanted to see Miss
Predock in her nightgown.

05:28.139 --> 05:30.373
That's an interesting
thing to say.

05:32.109 --> 05:34.310
I'm here because Mr. Thompson's
away on business

05:34.344 --> 05:37.145
and he asked me to look in.

05:40.783 --> 05:43.585
Was it Gyp Rosetti?

05:43.619 --> 05:46.287
- Who?
- The man Teddy saw.

05:46.321 --> 05:48.656
We have his dog.

05:48.690 --> 05:51.826
Mr. Rosetti's
not a gypsy.

05:51.860 --> 05:54.996
Mr. Thompson had some business
with him, but it's well concluded.

05:55.030 --> 05:58.832
And he wouldn't bother with
setting fires in your yard.

05:58.867 --> 06:01.803
Oily rags.

06:01.870 --> 06:04.905
Unless you believe in the pooka

06:04.939 --> 06:06.974
roaming the fields at night.

06:07.008 --> 06:10.877
The pooka takes the shape
of a black horse.

06:10.911 --> 06:13.346
<i>He also appears</i>
<i>as a goat or a rabbit.</i>

06:13.380 --> 06:15.048
<i>And how would</i>
<i>a rabbit start a fire?</i>

06:15.083 --> 06:16.850
<i>That's just my point.</i>

06:24.158 --> 06:25.793
You should have
seen this place.

06:25.827 --> 06:28.028
Swarming with state police.

06:28.063 --> 06:29.897
Schwarzkopf himself
made use of my office.

06:29.932 --> 06:33.068
- Who's that?
- The top banana, that's who.

06:33.102 --> 06:35.303
- And where are they now?
- <i>The troopers?</i>

06:35.338 --> 06:36.771
Well, they're gone.

06:36.806 --> 06:38.640
There's nothing left
for them to do.

06:38.674 --> 06:40.876
Now that your pal
Rosetti's flown the coop.

06:40.910 --> 06:43.912
You think I wanted him here?

06:43.947 --> 06:46.382
It was play nice or end up
a rib roast like Sickles.

06:46.416 --> 06:48.417
11 men died and you're
making jokes?

06:48.451 --> 06:52.221
A robbery... that's all
he said it'd be.

06:52.255 --> 06:53.956
I had no idea, I swear.

06:53.990 --> 06:55.657
<i>You of all people...</i>
<i>I mean,</i>

06:55.692 --> 06:57.526
I'm the sheriff,
for Christ's sakes.

06:59.028 --> 07:01.130
He leave anything
behind... Rosetti?

07:01.164 --> 07:04.099
- You mean besides the dead bodies?
- <i>Any hooch?</i>

07:04.133 --> 07:05.734
Any of our alcohol?

07:05.768 --> 07:07.635
Not a drop.

07:07.670 --> 07:10.838
He comes back, you see one hair

07:10.872 --> 07:13.140
on his greasy fuckin' head,
you pick up the phone.

07:13.175 --> 07:15.609
- You hear me?
- I swear, Eli, on my kids,

07:15.644 --> 07:18.112
you'll be the first to know.

07:18.146 --> 07:20.615
One more question...

07:20.649 --> 07:23.251
is it true Rosetti
was wearing a dog collar?

07:42.171 --> 07:44.172
Hello?

07:45.808 --> 07:47.241
Hello?

07:47.276 --> 07:49.877
- Oh, you startled me.
- I'm sorry, I...

07:49.912 --> 07:52.413
- is this room 404?
- Yes, sir.

07:52.448 --> 07:54.982
I'm supposed to meet an
acquaintance, a Mr. Means.

07:55.017 --> 07:56.217
There's no one here, sir.

07:56.251 --> 07:58.519
The last guest
checked out last night.

07:58.554 --> 08:01.718
- He did?
- Actually, it was a woman...French.

08:01.752 --> 08:04.986
- You can still smell the perfume.
- <i>Hello?</i>

08:08.256 --> 08:10.190
It appears we've been stood up.

08:10.225 --> 08:11.592
Remus can see that.

08:11.626 --> 08:14.694
If you'll forgive me, I do
need to get back to work.

08:20.033 --> 08:21.667
<i>What do you make of this?</i>

08:21.701 --> 08:24.970
- Is it the right day?
- <i>We can't both be wrong.</i>

08:25.005 --> 08:26.605
First Wednesday of every month.

08:26.640 --> 08:29.241
- <i>Did you call him?</i>
- I don't have his number.

08:30.710 --> 08:32.778
Remus does.

08:32.846 --> 08:35.481
Then Remus should call.
What are you asking me for?

08:39.653 --> 08:42.988
- <i>Long distance.</i>

08:43.023 --> 08:45.624
Washington DC.

08:45.659 --> 08:47.093
Yes, I'll hold.

08:47.127 --> 08:49.061
Something smells here.

08:49.096 --> 08:51.230
<i>Perfume, she said.</i>

08:51.264 --> 08:53.199
With Daugherty.

08:53.233 --> 08:54.667
Harry's all right.

08:54.701 --> 08:55.801
What rock have you been under?

08:55.835 --> 08:58.304
There's a Senate subcommittee.

08:58.338 --> 09:00.239
I'm sorry, sir, telephones
are for guests only.

09:00.274 --> 09:05.411
- Yes, operator, I'm still here.
- <i>Sir.</i>

09:05.445 --> 09:07.246
Shall I phone
the house detective?

09:07.281 --> 09:09.181
Let's call from the lobby.

09:11.752 --> 09:14.820
And give this flophouse
any more business?

09:14.855 --> 09:17.289
I'm heading home.

09:22.762 --> 09:24.997
He's from Cincinnati.

09:27.667 --> 09:30.803
And so the braves were assembled
before Chief Running Deer,

09:30.838 --> 09:33.373
the campfire blazing
in the darkness.

09:33.407 --> 09:36.910
"Which of you stole the horse?"
the chief asked.

09:36.944 --> 09:38.478
<i>The first brave said,</i>
<i>"Not I,"</i>

09:38.512 --> 09:40.847
<i>as did the second brave</i>
<i>beside him.</i>

09:40.882 --> 09:44.051
They stood there in silence.

09:44.085 --> 09:47.254
Then finally, the honest
Injun stepped forth

09:47.289 --> 09:50.458
<i>and told the truth,</i>
<i>admitting it was he.</i>

09:50.492 --> 09:53.829
<i>Upon hearing this, the wise </i>
<i>old chief looked at the braves.</i>

09:53.863 --> 09:56.098
<i>"My sons,"</i>
<i>he proclaimed,</i>

09:56.132 --> 09:58.767
pointing to the honest Injun,

09:58.801 --> 10:01.970
"I have chosen
your new chief."

10:02.005 --> 10:04.072
<i>Hear, hear.</i>

10:12.583 --> 10:14.650
Thank you,
Mr. Attorney General,

10:14.685 --> 10:16.819
for that very
inspirational tale.

10:16.854 --> 10:19.422
As I look out
at the eager faces

10:19.457 --> 10:21.158
- in this room today...
- You okay?

10:21.192 --> 10:25.328
...I see the moral fiber of America.

10:25.363 --> 10:28.565
<i>You boys will be</i>
<i>the leaders of tomorrow.</i>

10:28.599 --> 10:30.400
<i>And when one of you</i>
<i>youngsters becomes</i>

10:30.434 --> 10:33.469
<i>the next Andrew Carnegie,</i>
<i>the next Babe Ruth...</i>

10:33.504 --> 10:35.838
<i>maybe there's even</i>
<i>a Warren Harding among us...</i>

10:35.873 --> 10:40.109
<i>you will recollect that the values</i>
<i> that brought you success</i>

10:40.144 --> 10:44.847
were instilled by the
Boy Scouts of America.

10:44.881 --> 10:47.583
Well, it's all there
in the Scout Law, isn't it?

10:47.618 --> 10:52.054
- A Scout is trustworthy, loyal.

10:52.089 --> 10:55.992
<i>A Scout is helpful,</i>
<i>friendly, courteous.</i>

10:56.026 --> 11:01.230
<i>A Scout is kind, obedient,</i>
<i>pure of thought and deed.</i>

11:01.265 --> 11:02.966
How could we let it
get this far?

11:03.000 --> 11:04.701
Brace up, Jess.
Not here.

11:04.735 --> 11:08.372
We stole, Harry.
We stole.

11:08.406 --> 11:10.908
Apart from the laws of God,

11:10.942 --> 11:13.744
has a greater doctrine
ever been forged?

11:13.779 --> 11:16.914
<i>Come on.</i>
<i>Hear, hear!</i>

11:20.986 --> 11:22.953
Now, while we enjoy breakfast,

11:22.988 --> 11:25.489
Troop 14 from Laurel, Maryland,

11:25.524 --> 11:28.726
will serenade us
with a campfire favorite.

11:28.760 --> 11:30.661
Jess isn't feeling well.
He got a bad sausage.

11:30.696 --> 11:33.465
They undercook it,
it tends to spoil.

11:40.039 --> 11:42.907

11:53.920 --> 11:55.587
<i>You're getting</i>
<i>very skillful,</i>

11:55.621 --> 11:57.756
<i>except for the K</i>
<i>and the R.</i>

11:57.791 --> 11:59.292
The K is hard.

11:59.326 --> 12:01.598
We can go over it after dinner.

12:04.035 --> 12:06.737
Shall we do that?

12:06.771 --> 12:08.772
<i>Okay.</i>

12:11.376 --> 12:14.311
- Come sit beside me.

12:19.184 --> 12:22.186
I know things
are difficult right now,

12:22.220 --> 12:24.288
but we're all safe here.

12:24.322 --> 12:27.358
There's nothing for you or
your sister to worry about.

12:27.392 --> 12:29.427
What about the gypsy?

12:29.461 --> 12:31.495
Why would he start a fire?

12:31.529 --> 12:35.366
Because Daddy's not here.

12:35.400 --> 12:39.237
He started the fire and your
father wasn't here to catch him?

12:39.271 --> 12:43.040
Or because your father's
not here, he started a fire?

12:43.075 --> 12:44.975
Can't Owen live here with us?

12:46.011 --> 12:49.647
What? No.

12:49.681 --> 12:53.051
Mr. Sleater works
for your father.

12:53.085 --> 12:55.653
And that's not what we're
talking about right now.

12:55.687 --> 12:57.354
The important thing to remember

12:57.388 --> 12:59.723
is that we all need
to be careful

12:59.758 --> 13:02.693
so that accidents
don't happen again.

13:02.727 --> 13:04.161
Agreed?

13:04.195 --> 13:07.665
It's not going to happen again.

13:09.134 --> 13:11.869
All right, then.

13:11.903 --> 13:15.039
After supper,
we'll tackle the K.

13:19.244 --> 13:21.512
I don't know what your
split is with Gillian,

13:21.546 --> 13:24.148
but I can guarantee you
this is better.

13:24.183 --> 13:28.052
- 70-30, her favor.
- There you go, then.

13:28.087 --> 13:29.921
This is a 50-50 deal.

13:29.955 --> 13:32.190
You sell to the johns,
to the other girls.

13:32.224 --> 13:34.626
And you smoke it like opium?

13:36.629 --> 13:39.931
Sure, if you like.

13:39.966 --> 13:42.167
You can sniff a little, too.

13:43.603 --> 13:47.305
Even shoot it.

13:48.307 --> 13:49.675
What the fuck?!

13:49.709 --> 13:52.244
- You just barge in?
- Give me that.

13:52.278 --> 13:53.912
And get dressed.

13:57.817 --> 13:59.317
That's mine.

13:59.352 --> 14:01.653
We have standards
here, Charles.

14:01.687 --> 14:05.089
Our girls don't peddle dope.

14:05.124 --> 14:07.158
If they made any money,
they wouldn't have to.

14:07.192 --> 14:08.993
You dress these whores
like schoolmarms.

14:09.028 --> 14:12.230
It's tasteful, the way
things ought to be.

14:12.264 --> 14:13.798
In any event,
it hasn't stopped you

14:13.832 --> 14:15.700
from sampling the merchandise.

14:17.135 --> 14:19.069
It's the 20th century, sweetie.

14:19.104 --> 14:20.771
You wanna make a buck?

14:20.805 --> 14:22.506
Have them start showing
a little skin.

14:22.573 --> 14:25.975
Whatever would I do
without your advice?

14:35.051 --> 14:37.686
I gotta go.

14:37.720 --> 14:40.355
I'll see you next time
I'm in town.

14:40.389 --> 14:43.991
But unfortunately,
that won't be here.

14:44.026 --> 14:46.827
Gather your things.
You're fired.

14:46.862 --> 14:48.562
- What?
- Hey!

14:48.597 --> 14:50.030
I'm part owner of this joint.

14:50.065 --> 14:51.999
But it's my house, remember?

14:52.033 --> 14:54.134
I thought it was Jimmy's.

14:55.169 --> 14:58.505
Actually, you're right, it is.

15:16.191 --> 15:18.192
<i>What are you hearing,</i>
<i>any scuttlebutt?</i>

15:18.226 --> 15:21.162
I keep calling Jess Smith, but
I can't get a straight answer.

15:21.196 --> 15:23.864
For 10 grand a month, you think
you'd at least get reassurance.

15:23.899 --> 15:25.699
Well, I'm not paying
another dime.

15:25.734 --> 15:28.269
Here's a new face.
What brings you to town?

15:31.039 --> 15:32.141
<i>Well, isn't this chummy?</i>

15:32.142 --> 15:33.874
We're in the middle
of a private meeting.

15:33.875 --> 15:35.976
Well, now you're
in the middle of another one.

15:36.010 --> 15:38.412
Remus has business
that doesn't concern you.

15:38.446 --> 15:40.547
You get lost on your way
back to Ohio?

15:40.614 --> 15:43.483
- I'll call you later, Nucky.
- I'm here now, Harry.

15:43.517 --> 15:45.285
And I want answers.

15:45.319 --> 15:47.854
Boys, give us a minute.

15:56.163 --> 15:59.432
Your man Means didn't
show at the hotel.

15:59.466 --> 16:02.302
- Something came up.
- And you couldn't pick up a phone?

16:02.336 --> 16:04.136
How much trouble
are you in, Harry?

16:04.171 --> 16:06.205
I told you, it's a witch hunt.

16:06.240 --> 16:08.607
And your companion there looks like
he's about to be burned at the stake.

16:08.642 --> 16:10.943
Jess is fine.

16:10.978 --> 16:12.978
He's under
a little strain is all.

16:13.013 --> 16:15.147
- These investigations...
- So who's the patsy,

16:15.181 --> 16:17.683
the poor sap you're gonna
feed to the wolves?

16:17.717 --> 16:18.884
I don't know what
you're talking about.

16:18.919 --> 16:20.820
You indicting me, Harry?

16:20.854 --> 16:22.922
Don't be so dramatic.

16:22.956 --> 16:24.924
That's not an answer.

16:24.958 --> 16:26.725
I don't owe you one.

16:26.760 --> 16:29.862
Indict Remus instead.

16:29.897 --> 16:32.231
- That's never gonna happen.
- Why not?

16:32.266 --> 16:35.735
Because Jess Smith
would be implicated, too.

16:35.770 --> 16:37.704
He's the only one
Remus ever paid directly.

16:37.738 --> 16:40.340
You'll save your lackey's ass
over someone who's given you

16:40.375 --> 16:42.710
- hundreds of thousands of dollars?
- <i>Hearsay.</i>

16:42.744 --> 16:45.379
I never accepted a red cent
from you, Mr. Thompson.

16:45.414 --> 16:47.014
I delivered
the State of New Jersey

16:47.049 --> 16:49.917
so your fucking puppet could
pretend to be president.

16:49.952 --> 16:53.121
You're the only Republican
that voted, eh?

16:53.155 --> 16:55.924
Harry, I swear to Christ,

16:55.958 --> 16:58.560
if you bring me down,
you're coming with me...

16:58.594 --> 17:01.062
lock, stock,
and whiskey barrel.

17:02.831 --> 17:05.266
Who do you think the American
people are gonna believe?

17:05.300 --> 17:08.035
The Attorney General
of the United States

17:08.069 --> 17:10.671
or a washed-up bootlegger
from New Jersey?

17:10.704 --> 17:14.441
Well, I guess we'll
find out, won't we?

17:24.218 --> 17:27.554
A rather frank
individual, isn't he?

17:27.589 --> 17:30.090
Who could use
a lesson in civics.

17:30.124 --> 17:33.527
Well, I shall endeavor
to do my best.

17:35.130 --> 17:38.099
So they give Forbes the boot
and nothing changes.

17:38.133 --> 17:40.301
The Veterans Bureau
still denied me benefits.

17:40.335 --> 17:41.736
Coffers are empty, pal.

17:41.770 --> 17:44.005
I have half a mind
to head down to Washington

17:44.039 --> 17:45.807
and shit on
the White House lawn.

17:45.841 --> 17:47.876
I'd
like to see you do that.

17:47.910 --> 17:49.978
President Harding said
he'll take care of us.

17:50.012 --> 17:51.513
Shouldn't we give him a chance?

17:51.547 --> 17:54.416
- Yeah, right.
- <i>Go back</i><i>to Kansas, kid.</i>

17:54.450 --> 17:56.819
The Bureau give you disability?

17:56.853 --> 17:58.854
'Course not.
Why you think he's here?

17:58.888 --> 18:02.424
They said that my injuries
did not prevent me

18:02.459 --> 18:04.493
from securing
gainful employment.

18:04.528 --> 18:07.029
Jesus, what's it take?

18:07.064 --> 18:09.832
- I say we start the petition
- Yeah.

18:09.867 --> 18:11.300
You finished
with the bellyaching?

18:11.335 --> 18:13.002
Some of us would like a drink.

18:13.036 --> 18:14.737
Yeah, I'll second that.

18:14.772 --> 18:16.673
France...
big fuckin' deal.

18:16.707 --> 18:18.141
What's that supposed to mean?

18:18.175 --> 18:20.743
- At least you were fighting white men.
- Aw, here we go.

18:20.778 --> 18:22.512
Our hero of the Philippines.

18:22.546 --> 18:25.649
Bring democracy to the savages...
bullshit.

18:25.683 --> 18:27.117
We fought that war
for the Sugar Trust.

18:27.151 --> 18:29.986
- What? - You're talking
like a Bolshevik, mister.

18:30.021 --> 18:31.888
Grow up, sonny.
Get your diaper changed.

18:31.923 --> 18:33.823
<i>Oh!</i>

18:33.858 --> 18:36.993
- What are you looking at, Half Moon?
- Lay off, Sagorsky.

18:37.028 --> 18:38.562
Drink your drink and shut up.

18:38.596 --> 18:41.332
- <i>Shove it.</i>
- <i>Yeah, shut up.</i>

18:41.366 --> 18:44.602
One of these days I'm gonna
teach you a lesson, son.

18:44.636 --> 18:47.205
- Fight night's tomorrow, pops.
- <i>There you go.</i>

18:47.239 --> 18:50.475
- Farm boy's got a big trap.
- Ooh.

18:50.510 --> 18:52.678
I can make a fist, too.

18:52.712 --> 18:55.681
You're pissing up
the wrong tree.

18:55.715 --> 18:58.083
- Do it.
- Tomorrow night, then.

18:59.519 --> 19:02.187
Here's to you, boys.

19:02.221 --> 19:04.155
Bunch of fuckin' saps.

19:04.189 --> 19:06.891
- Fuckin' asshole.

19:12.130 --> 19:14.498
And a pack of Luckies.

19:16.334 --> 19:17.934
Keep it.

19:22.807 --> 19:24.174
Help you fellas?

19:24.208 --> 19:27.177
We were thinking maybe
we could help you.

19:27.211 --> 19:29.246
Well, I have no bags,
but thank you very much.

19:29.280 --> 19:31.915
- Day-tripper, huh?
- Stay awhile, see the sights.

19:31.950 --> 19:34.518
Actually, I've got tickets for a
Broadway show tomorrow night.

19:34.552 --> 19:36.653
- <i>Eddie Cantor.</i>
- Lincoln Memorial's finally finished.

19:36.688 --> 19:38.389
I hear it's really something.

19:39.725 --> 19:41.526
You gents with
the Chamber of Commerce?

19:41.560 --> 19:44.228
- We're with the Justice Department.
- Harry Daugherty's outfit.

19:44.263 --> 19:45.630
And you're bragging about that?

19:45.664 --> 19:48.199
- <i>What's in the bag,</i><i>wisenheimer?</i>
- Cough syrup.

19:48.234 --> 19:50.302
Not feeling well?

19:51.537 --> 19:53.405
I have a train, boys,
so if you don't mind...

19:53.439 --> 19:55.340
We do mind, actually.

19:57.043 --> 19:58.443
Well, gee,

19:58.478 --> 20:00.913
this here's a violation
of the Volstead Act.

20:04.084 --> 20:05.885
Stick around, pal.

20:05.919 --> 20:07.720
We got a nice, comfy room for you,

20:07.754 --> 20:10.590
courtesy of the attorney general.

20:20.801 --> 20:23.636
- Yes?

20:23.670 --> 20:25.338
Sorry to disturb, ma'am.

20:25.372 --> 20:28.107
Miss Predock is downstairs.

20:28.142 --> 20:31.143
She is aware Mr. Sleater
doesn't live here, isn't she?

20:31.178 --> 20:33.712
There's something she needs
to discuss with you.

20:38.585 --> 20:40.586
What's going on?

20:42.890 --> 20:45.291
I think he...

20:45.325 --> 20:46.926
may have gotten lost.

20:46.960 --> 20:49.161
He was over on my property.

20:49.196 --> 20:50.663
Why?

20:50.697 --> 20:53.633
Maybe we should talk.

20:54.668 --> 20:56.369
Go sit in the parlor.

20:56.403 --> 20:58.237
You're not to move
until I come for you.

20:58.272 --> 21:00.406
- Understood?
- I need my bag.

21:00.440 --> 21:01.807
We'll discuss that later.

21:01.842 --> 21:03.642
Go on.

21:06.412 --> 21:08.080
I don't mean to be melodramatic.

21:08.114 --> 21:11.350
I... I was getting ready to go
back to Philadelphia for the week

21:11.384 --> 21:13.585
and I just wanted to be sure...

21:13.620 --> 21:16.288
well, oily rags and all that.

21:16.322 --> 21:18.624
I found him in my garage.

21:18.658 --> 21:21.593
- Doing what?
- He wouldn't say.

21:21.627 --> 21:23.395
But...

21:33.106 --> 21:37.041
Look, I loathe busybodies,

21:37.076 --> 21:39.610
so not a word.

21:50.221 --> 21:52.889
But if you ever want to talk,

21:52.924 --> 21:54.357
I'm a good listener.

21:54.391 --> 21:56.926
Yes.
Thank you.

22:12.776 --> 22:14.577
I didn't do it.

22:14.612 --> 22:16.246
Do what?

22:16.280 --> 22:19.182
Burn the greenhouse.

22:19.217 --> 22:21.852
Why were you in
Miss Predock's garage?

22:23.355 --> 22:25.390
You must have had a reason.

22:25.424 --> 22:26.958
The man.

22:26.992 --> 22:28.960
The gypsy man?

22:28.995 --> 22:31.697
He was going to light
another fire.

22:31.731 --> 22:35.501
- Why?
- Because he...

22:35.535 --> 22:38.938
likes to burn
things up, I guess.

22:46.446 --> 22:48.448
And what are these for?

22:53.921 --> 22:55.955
I don't know
what to do with you.

22:55.990 --> 22:58.224
<i>You sneak about.</i>
<i>You lie.</i>

22:58.259 --> 22:59.793
<i>You destroy things.</i>

22:59.827 --> 23:02.663
You'll end up hurting people.

23:02.697 --> 23:04.665
Do you think that's right?

23:08.537 --> 23:10.338
Stand up.

23:14.243 --> 23:16.278
Face away from me.

23:33.997 --> 23:36.565
Now go to your room!

23:48.910 --> 23:51.779
Come on, you
fuckin' powder puff.

23:51.814 --> 23:53.249
- Is that all you got?

23:53.282 --> 23:54.382
- <i>You got that mouth of his!</i>

23:54.383 --> 23:56.551
- Come on, Tuck, you got him!
- Come on, Tuck, baby!

23:56.585 --> 23:58.452
Come on, hit him!
Hit him!

23:58.487 --> 24:01.488
That's it, Tuck!
Come on!

24:03.057 --> 24:04.257
Come on, Tuck!

24:04.291 --> 24:07.060
<i>Come on, baby, yeah!</i>

24:08.829 --> 24:10.630
<i>Give him a shot</i>
<i>in the kisser!</i><i>Well done!</i>

24:10.664 --> 24:12.932
- <i>That's it, baby!</i>
- <i>Come on, he's nothing.</i>

24:12.966 --> 24:15.367
- <i>Come on, give it to him!</i>
- You kiss the Kaiser like that?

24:15.402 --> 24:16.902
<i>Come on, Tuck!</i>

24:16.936 --> 24:19.337
<i>Don't let him get a hit in!</i>
<i>Come on!</i>

24:20.706 --> 24:22.340
<i>Don't let him dance</i>
<i>around you, Tuck!</i>

24:22.375 --> 24:24.343
<i>Come on, Tuck,</i>
<i>give him one!</i>

24:25.211 --> 24:27.912
<i>Come on, sock him!</i>

24:32.118 --> 24:34.453
- Oh!
- Come on.

24:35.622 --> 24:37.556
Fuckin' tomato can!

24:37.590 --> 24:39.425
Come on, get up,
get up, get up!

24:40.960 --> 24:42.361
Come on!

24:42.395 --> 24:44.363
<i>Keep going, Tuck.</i>
<i>Don't give up!</i>

24:44.397 --> 24:45.598
Come on, Tuck.

24:45.632 --> 24:48.634
<i>Give it up, old man.</i>
<i>You got nothing left.</i>

24:48.669 --> 24:50.937
<i>The body, Tuck...</i>
<i>hit the body.</i>

24:50.971 --> 24:52.705
Man #2.
<i>Again. Hit him again.</i>

24:53.907 --> 24:57.210
<i>Come on,</i>
<i>he's just an old man.</i>

25:00.515 --> 25:03.150
<i>You'll show him now!</i>
<i>Attaboy!</i>

25:03.184 --> 25:04.919
<i>Give it to him, Tuck!</i>

25:08.657 --> 25:12.294
<i>That's</i> how I kiss
the Kaiser.

25:30.146 --> 25:32.781
18 goddamn hours

25:32.815 --> 25:35.417
without so much
as a telephone call.

25:35.451 --> 25:37.052
A phone call?

25:37.086 --> 25:39.655
We're lucky they even fed us.

25:40.958 --> 25:43.726
Moldy cheese on stale bread...
you call this food?

25:43.761 --> 25:46.697
Depends how hungry I am.

25:46.731 --> 25:48.698
Alby Gold.

25:49.801 --> 25:52.035
- Nucky Thompson.
- Nucky?

25:52.070 --> 25:55.139
That's quite a moniker.

25:55.173 --> 25:57.041
So what are you in for, Nucky?

25:57.075 --> 25:59.877
An unquenchable thirst.

26:01.212 --> 26:05.382
Me, I'm in the hooch
business, a wholesaler.

26:05.416 --> 26:09.786
- Nabbed me with quite a haul.
- You don't say.

26:09.821 --> 26:12.322
Almost five cases,

26:12.357 --> 26:14.758
nearly an entire week's work.

26:14.792 --> 26:18.328
I got a still in my basement.

26:18.362 --> 26:21.164
Is it worth it?

26:21.198 --> 26:23.799
I mean, there's gotta be
easier ways to make a buck.

26:23.833 --> 26:25.901
If there are,
I haven't found any.

26:28.304 --> 26:31.773
Say, um, you gonna eat that?

26:36.378 --> 26:40.981
Sullivan, Goodheart,
McHugh, and Tinao,

26:41.016 --> 26:42.883
<i>you're up.</i>

26:50.191 --> 26:52.058
Catubig.

26:53.060 --> 26:55.061
Beg pardon?

26:55.095 --> 26:57.330
Catubig.

26:57.364 --> 27:00.166
- It was a battle.
- Philippines.

27:00.200 --> 27:02.368
We lost.

27:02.403 --> 27:06.072
But do you think
we gave up the fight?

27:06.106 --> 27:08.908
"To serve honestly
and faithfully

27:08.942 --> 27:11.177
against all enemies."

27:16.817 --> 27:19.051
Where's my bottle?

27:32.231 --> 27:35.333
What's all this bullshit
about alcohol?

27:36.702 --> 27:39.303
A man is willing to lay his
life down for his country,

27:39.338 --> 27:41.873
you best let that man
have a goddamn drink.

27:41.907 --> 27:43.541
His daughter's here.

27:49.649 --> 27:51.783
Dad, again?

27:51.817 --> 27:53.385
<i>I'm fine.</i>

27:53.419 --> 27:55.987
I should see
the other fella, right?

27:58.858 --> 28:02.228
- I don't need any help!
- Of course not, Gentleman Jim.

28:02.262 --> 28:05.431
You've got it all
under control.

28:13.040 --> 28:14.508
Thank you.

28:14.542 --> 28:16.644
He's a bit of a handful.

28:16.678 --> 28:18.179
You're welcome.

28:18.213 --> 28:20.848
I'm Julia Sagorsky.

28:20.882 --> 28:22.716
Richard Harrow.

28:22.751 --> 28:25.753
Well, don't take
any wooden nickels.

Docket number
US 137-aught-4,

29:51.170 --> 29:53.638
United States versus
Leon Bradford Wendover

29:53.673 --> 29:57.576
for violation of Title II,
Section 3 of the Volstead Act.

30:02.348 --> 30:04.549
- Miss Randolph?
- <i>Mr. Wendover</i>

30:04.584 --> 30:07.552
was caught red-handed selling
10 cases of rye whiskey

30:07.587 --> 30:08.988
to members of Phi Sigma Kappa.

30:09.022 --> 30:10.022
Mr. Davidoff?

30:10.056 --> 30:11.723
Your Honor, my client
has no knowledge...

30:11.758 --> 30:13.225
<i>Yes, yes.</i>

30:13.259 --> 30:15.694
I want you both up here now.

30:25.138 --> 30:26.505
Your client's guilty.

30:26.539 --> 30:29.141
- Your Honor, this hearing...
- <i>Guilty.</i>

30:29.175 --> 30:31.310
The fine is $5.

30:32.245 --> 30:34.546
- Let's move on.
- Sure, yes.

30:34.581 --> 30:36.849
$5? Is this
some sort of joke?

30:36.883 --> 30:38.450
This entire undertaking

30:38.485 --> 30:41.054
is sort of a joke,
wouldn't you say?

30:41.088 --> 30:42.589
<i>Next!</i>

30:42.623 --> 30:45.325
<i>Docket number</i>
<i>US 137-aught-5.</i>

30:45.359 --> 30:47.928
<i>United States versus</i>
<i>Enoch Malachi Thompson</i>

30:47.962 --> 30:51.798
<i>for violation of Title II, Section 3</i>
<i>of the Volstead Act.</i>

30:55.437 --> 30:57.371
Step up, please.

31:05.380 --> 31:07.481
- Miss Randolph?
- One moment, Your Honor.

31:07.516 --> 31:10.952
I wasn't aware this defendant was
being brought before you tonight.

31:12.755 --> 31:16.157
First, let me say that Mr.Thompson
enjoys the dubious distinction

31:16.191 --> 31:19.160
of being the premier bootlegger
in Atlantic City, New Jersey.

31:19.194 --> 31:22.697
The People on a previous
occasion prosecuted Mr. Thompson

31:22.732 --> 31:25.867
- for solicitation of murder, graft...
- Objection, Your Hon...

31:25.902 --> 31:28.537
extortion, and multiple
violations of the Volstead Act.

31:28.571 --> 31:30.472
We request a fine of $2,000

31:30.507 --> 31:32.875
and a sentence of one year
in a federal penitentiary.

31:32.910 --> 31:36.079
- Jesus Christ.  - Your Honor,
my client is being charged

31:36.113 --> 31:37.947
with possessing
one pint of liquor.

31:37.981 --> 31:39.615
$5.

31:39.650 --> 31:41.651
Your Honor, to allow
this man to simply...

31:41.685 --> 31:43.819
<i>Miss Randolph,</i>
<i>I sympathize</i>

31:43.854 --> 31:46.756
with your desire to bring
purpose to your life.

31:46.790 --> 31:50.193
However, this courtroom
is not the place to do it.

31:50.227 --> 31:51.097
Next.

31:51.164 --> 31:53.964
<i>Docket number</i>
<i>US 137-aught-6.</i>

31:53.965 --> 31:55.732
<i>United States</i>
<i>versus Albert Isaac Gold</i>

31:55.766 --> 31:59.235
<i>for violation of Title II, Section 3</i>
<i>of the Volstead Act.</i>

32:06.944 --> 32:08.812
Can you break a hundred?

32:08.846 --> 32:11.114
- Whoa!

32:11.149 --> 32:14.785
- Bravo!

32:18.756 --> 32:20.123
<i>Here it is, all night.</i>

32:20.157 --> 32:21.857
<i>Right here,</i>
<i>starting right now.</i>

32:21.892 --> 32:23.359
<i>We're going to bring out</i>
<i>the fire-eaters,</i>

32:23.393 --> 32:25.294
<i>the snake girl,</i>
<i>the Indonesian midgets.</i>

32:25.328 --> 32:27.062
<i>Watch the doorway.</i>
<i>Here they come.</i>

32:27.096 --> 32:28.530
<i>We're gonna bring them</i>
<i>out here... all three...</i>

32:28.564 --> 32:29.964
<i>so you can see</i>
<i>what they look like.</i>

32:29.999 --> 32:31.599
<i>Here comes</i>
<i>the Princess of Fire.</i>

32:31.633 --> 32:33.701
<i>She's gonna swallow a little </i>
<i>fire for you right now.</i>

32:33.735 --> 32:35.769
<i>Watch the doorway.</i>
<i>Keep your eyes wide open.</i>

32:35.804 --> 32:37.438
<i>You don't want to miss</i>
<i>any of the acts.</i>

32:37.472 --> 32:38.806
<i>It's all free.</i>

32:38.840 --> 32:40.240
<i>Gonna do a little magic</i>
<i>for you.</i>

32:40.275 --> 32:41.975
<i>This was taught to me</i>
<i>by our master magician.</i>

32:42.009 --> 32:44.745
<i>Just one of the 10 acts</i>
<i>you're gonna see on the inside.</i>

32:44.779 --> 32:46.446
<i>Watch the bill,</i>
<i>watch the bill.</i>

32:46.481 --> 32:48.148
<i>Keep your eyes</i>
<i>on that bill.</i>

32:55.991 --> 32:58.126
That's not true.

32:59.428 --> 33:01.563
Somebody butt me.

33:04.367 --> 33:06.168
Here.

33:08.672 --> 33:09.939
Thanks.

33:09.974 --> 33:12.542
Thank you.

33:15.313 --> 33:17.147
Are you from Atlantic City?

33:17.181 --> 33:19.049
Evansville, Indiana.

33:19.083 --> 33:22.485
Here just looking for work.

33:23.920 --> 33:27.189
- What's your name?
- Roger.

33:27.223 --> 33:29.124
Roger McAllister.

33:34.131 --> 33:36.532
Do you ever dream, Roger?

33:36.567 --> 33:38.834
Well, sure.

33:38.869 --> 33:41.336
I mean, who doesn't, right?

33:41.371 --> 33:44.206
It's wonderful, isn't it?

33:44.240 --> 33:48.009
A world where
we're safe and happy,

33:48.044 --> 33:50.578
surrounded by those we love.

33:51.514 --> 33:52.847
Uh, yeah.

33:52.881 --> 33:55.116
I mean,
I... I guess.

33:55.150 --> 33:57.952
Dreams are where
we should live.

33:59.888 --> 34:02.923
But we have to live in life.

34:04.893 --> 34:07.794
I know it's not proper
to talk to strange men.

34:07.829 --> 34:09.263
No, no.

34:09.297 --> 34:11.998
You remind me of someone.

34:16.605 --> 34:20.074
- Good night, Esther.
- Good night.

34:20.109 --> 34:23.011
You know, haul me in there
another hundred thousand times,

34:23.045 --> 34:25.280
you might actually put
a dent in my bankroll.

34:25.315 --> 34:29.083
I only enforce the law.
I don't set the fines.

34:29.152 --> 34:30.652
It was a joke.

34:30.687 --> 34:34.924
Seeing you in handcuffs
already had me in stitches.

34:34.958 --> 34:37.893
I'm guessing you don't have a
lot to laugh about these days.

34:37.928 --> 34:40.161
Heading home?

34:40.196 --> 34:43.632
Why would a man like you
ask me a question like that?

34:43.666 --> 34:46.201
It's nearly 5:00 a.m.,
I'm hungry,

34:46.235 --> 34:48.937
and I hate to eat alone.

34:48.971 --> 34:51.005
Whatever it is,
you have to admit,

34:51.039 --> 34:54.341
it's probably going
to be interesting.

34:57.378 --> 34:59.579
I thought you were hungry.

34:59.614 --> 35:01.315
I'm fine with coffee.

35:01.349 --> 35:03.216
But you go ahead.

35:03.251 --> 35:05.151
You look like you need it.

35:07.856 --> 35:09.189
You see yourself as some sort

35:09.224 --> 35:11.391
of paterfamilias, don't you?

35:12.393 --> 35:13.861
I didn't go to law school.

35:13.895 --> 35:15.162
What does that mean?

35:15.196 --> 35:18.265
The patriarch, the
provider, the boss.

35:18.300 --> 35:21.835
Well, I <i>was</i>
county treasurer,

35:21.870 --> 35:23.938
but those days are gone.

35:23.972 --> 35:25.639
"Where are the snows
of yesteryear?"

35:25.674 --> 35:27.708
You've got a poetic side.

35:27.742 --> 35:31.345
Yes, I'm all lace
and potpourri.

35:31.379 --> 35:34.348
You know, we do have
a common enemy.

35:35.416 --> 35:37.784
- Surprise me.
- Harry Daugherty.

35:37.819 --> 35:41.288
I assure you, the attorney
general and I get on quite well.

35:41.322 --> 35:43.223
The Queen of the Night Court...

35:43.257 --> 35:44.890
scourge of the saloon keeper.

35:44.925 --> 35:47.092
It's an honest living.

35:47.127 --> 35:49.494
But not what you had in mind
when you accepted a position

35:49.529 --> 35:51.563
with the attorney
general's office.

35:51.597 --> 35:53.798
I finally got you convicted.

35:54.767 --> 35:56.067
I don't think either of us

35:56.101 --> 35:58.069
will see that
as our finest hour.

35:58.137 --> 36:00.705
Is there a particular point
you're trying to make?

36:00.740 --> 36:04.042
Your boss is going to indict me

36:04.076 --> 36:05.610
to save his own skin.

36:05.645 --> 36:08.580
- I'll root for the home team, then.
- Which team is that?

36:08.615 --> 36:11.817
The one that set you up
for a fall in Atlantic City

36:11.851 --> 36:13.819
and then blamed you
for bungling it?

36:13.853 --> 36:15.588
Worked out pretty well for you.

36:15.622 --> 36:17.190
But you had me
on the ropes, Esther.

36:17.224 --> 36:19.091
And if you don't think
I was sweating,

36:19.126 --> 36:22.962
- you're selling yourself short.
- I'm... flattered?

36:22.997 --> 36:26.266
And here you are now
with a 20 c breakfast,

36:26.300 --> 36:29.669
intelligent, capable,
and invisible.

36:29.704 --> 36:31.738
Is this where Eve
gets offered the apple?

36:31.772 --> 36:34.474
It's where I offer you
George Remus.

36:35.943 --> 36:37.610
- He...
- I know who George Remus is.

36:37.645 --> 36:40.914
- Don't you think he belongs in jail?
- Instead of you?

36:40.948 --> 36:42.749
He's the biggest bootlegger
in the country.

36:42.784 --> 36:44.918
And I can give you
his entire operation.

36:44.952 --> 36:46.620
He's directly connected
to Jess Smith.

36:46.654 --> 36:48.388
And Smith connects
to Daugherty.

36:48.422 --> 36:50.657
Who, for that reason, would never
allow Remus to be prosecuted.

36:50.691 --> 36:52.592
But if the whole ball of wax

36:52.627 --> 36:55.695
was sanctioned
by a higher authority,

36:55.730 --> 36:58.498
someone winds up
with a career-making case.

37:00.868 --> 37:03.670
I'm $5 worth
of trouble, Esther.

37:03.704 --> 37:07.274
The real crooks are in an upstairs
office in the Justice Department.

37:07.308 --> 37:08.775
That's quite an allegation.

37:08.809 --> 37:11.344
I'm just telling you
what you already know.

37:11.379 --> 37:15.048
President Harding would never
force Mr.Daugherty's hand.

37:15.082 --> 37:17.517
- Unless someone made him.
- Such as?

37:17.552 --> 37:18.985
I'm working on it.

37:19.020 --> 37:22.356
Can we at least say that
I've piqued your interest?

37:22.390 --> 37:24.658
What makes you think that?

37:24.693 --> 37:26.728
You're still sitting here.

37:26.762 --> 37:28.696
Maybe I'm just hungry.

37:30.299 --> 37:33.234
Here's a chance
to fill your plate.

37:46.683 --> 37:49.651
<i>Say hello</i>
<i>to Mrs. Thompson for me.</i>

37:56.258 --> 37:59.661
- That's it. That's it, baby.
- Yeah, yeah.

38:01.364 --> 38:03.198
That's it.

38:04.100 --> 38:06.202
Come on, baby.

38:26.089 --> 38:28.057
My God,

38:28.091 --> 38:30.159
you've taken me back

38:30.193 --> 38:32.962
to the way I used to feel.

38:50.215 --> 38:52.917
Are you really 29?

38:52.951 --> 38:54.089
Does it matter?

38:54.122 --> 38:57.822
<i>Ain't never made </i>
<i>a girl older than me.</i>

38:57.823 --> 39:02.059
But, hell, none of them make me
dizzy like you make me dizzy.

39:02.094 --> 39:04.929
You're a gentlemen
above all else.

39:04.963 --> 39:07.865
Shoot.

39:07.899 --> 39:10.801
How long have you been
at this boardinghouse?

39:11.903 --> 39:15.138
- A week on Friday.
- Then what?

39:15.173 --> 39:17.040
Just about bust.

39:17.075 --> 39:19.243
I can't afford another day.

39:19.277 --> 39:21.879
- Unless you get a job.
- Yeah.

39:21.913 --> 39:24.982
You... you got a line
on something?

39:25.884 --> 39:28.118
I can ask around.

39:29.187 --> 39:31.322
That'd be swell.

39:32.524 --> 39:35.727
What do they call you
back home?

39:35.761 --> 39:38.563
How do you mean?

39:38.597 --> 39:40.131
You have a nickname?

39:40.166 --> 39:43.068
No, but...
it's just plain Roger.

39:46.673 --> 39:51.677
- Well, I'm going to call you James.
- James.

39:51.744 --> 39:53.779
Why James?

39:56.215 --> 40:00.786
Because he was a king.

40:11.731 --> 40:13.298
<i>Arkansas.</i>

40:13.333 --> 40:14.700
Little Rock.

40:14.734 --> 40:17.303
- <i>Colorado.</i>
- You skipped one.

40:17.337 --> 40:20.039
California.

40:20.073 --> 40:22.609
What is the capital
of California?

40:22.643 --> 40:24.244
Sacramento.

40:25.279 --> 40:27.047
You're quite remarkable.

40:34.556 --> 40:36.790
Finish your breakfast.

40:43.631 --> 40:45.532
Sorry to interrupt.

40:45.566 --> 40:47.234
Is something wrong?

40:47.268 --> 40:48.935
No, not at all.

40:48.970 --> 40:50.737
Just wanted you to know
we caught the man.

40:50.772 --> 40:53.474
- What man?
- <i>The vagrant.</i>

40:53.508 --> 40:55.109
He'd been sneaking
about the neighborhood,

40:55.143 --> 40:57.311
breaking into yards,
sleeping where he can.

40:57.345 --> 41:00.614
<i>He lit the fire to keep warm</i>
<i>and it got out of hand.</i>

41:00.649 --> 41:02.883
<i>Anyway, you won't be</i>
<i>seeing him again.</i>

41:02.918 --> 41:05.619
He...

41:05.654 --> 41:07.388
what did you do?

41:09.091 --> 41:11.292
It's all taken care of.

41:40.322 --> 41:44.291
Mr. Harrow,
good afternoon.

41:44.325 --> 41:47.261
I don't mean to intrude.

41:47.295 --> 41:50.364
Your father left his jacket.

41:52.868 --> 41:55.369
This fell out the pocket.

41:56.739 --> 41:58.739
It got scratched.

41:59.808 --> 42:03.978
- Thank you.
- Is he feeling better?

42:04.913 --> 42:07.615
He's asleep.

42:09.986 --> 42:13.355
- I'd ask you in, but...
- No, I understand.

42:13.389 --> 42:15.123
No.

42:15.157 --> 42:17.925
I mean, Dad's going
through one of his moods.

42:17.959 --> 42:20.361
I don't want to
set him off again.

42:23.999 --> 42:27.601
This was my brother's...
Fred.

42:27.636 --> 42:29.937
He died in the Argonne

42:29.972 --> 42:32.173
right before the armistice.

42:32.207 --> 42:34.709
Mm.

42:34.743 --> 42:37.178
My father can't forgive that.

42:37.246 --> 42:38.646
Goes off to the Legion Hall

42:38.681 --> 42:41.983
like he's going to find
Freddie just sitting there.

42:42.017 --> 42:43.818
"Hi, Pop."

42:43.853 --> 42:47.189
He gets himself
into these fights.

42:47.223 --> 42:49.825
Mm.

42:49.859 --> 42:52.027
You have family?

42:53.362 --> 42:55.096
A sister.

42:55.130 --> 42:57.732
Are you close?

43:00.770 --> 43:03.338
We're close.

43:05.775 --> 43:08.911
Then she's lucky
to have you back.

43:11.882 --> 43:13.883
- <i>Hello?</i>
- <i>It's me.</i>

43:13.917 --> 43:18.488
I, uh, was detained
in Washington unexpectedly.

43:18.522 --> 43:22.325
But I didn't want you to think I'm not
concerned about what's been going on.

43:22.359 --> 43:23.993
Nothing has been going on.

43:24.027 --> 43:26.929
<i>You don't need to be</i>
<i>stoic about it.</i>

43:26.964 --> 43:28.798
A vagrant started a fire.

43:28.832 --> 43:30.432
He's been caught and...

43:30.467 --> 43:34.236
taken care of, I'm told.

43:34.270 --> 43:36.038
<i>The greenhouse</i>
<i>can be repaired</i>

43:36.072 --> 43:37.573
<i>if that's what</i>
<i>you'd like.</i>

43:37.607 --> 43:39.909
That isn't important.
But, yes, have it repaired.

43:39.943 --> 43:41.745
<i>Final boarding</i>
<i>on track number seven...</i>

43:41.779 --> 43:42.779
<i>What is important?</i>

43:42.880 --> 43:45.815
- I'm sorry, there's a lot of noise.

43:45.850 --> 43:47.984
<i>What did you say?</i>

43:48.019 --> 43:51.355
I asked you what you think
is important.

43:51.389 --> 43:53.557
Look, I didn't call to...

43:55.827 --> 43:59.263
The kids.
The kids are important.

43:59.298 --> 44:01.799
Are they all right?

44:01.834 --> 44:03.301
<i>Margaret?</i>

44:03.335 --> 44:05.536
We're all fine.

44:05.571 --> 44:08.406
Teddy's been protecting us.

44:08.440 --> 44:10.007
<i>Really?</i>

44:10.042 --> 44:13.210
<i>Well, he's a brave</i>
<i>little scout.</i>

44:13.244 --> 44:15.045
We should have a conversation

44:15.079 --> 44:16.713
when you return.

44:17.882 --> 44:20.517
- We don't have to.
- <i>I think we do.</i>

44:20.551 --> 44:24.620
Things just can't go on being
every which way, can they?

44:28.492 --> 44:30.893
They're calling my train.

44:30.927 --> 44:33.863
Then you should rush.

44:56.353 --> 44:59.622
- Mr. Murray?
- Ma'am?

44:59.656 --> 45:02.124
That was just Mr.Thompson
on the phone.

45:02.158 --> 45:04.894
He says you needn't concern
yourself with us anymore

45:04.928 --> 45:07.163
now the danger's past.

45:07.197 --> 45:08.965
You sure?

45:08.999 --> 45:11.400
You've been a great comfort.

45:18.775 --> 45:21.610
<i>Are you sleeping?</i>

45:21.645 --> 45:25.581
- No.
- <i>Tell me again.</i>

45:25.616 --> 45:28.018
It's just going to scare you.

45:28.052 --> 45:30.487
<i>It won't, I promise.</i>

45:30.521 --> 45:33.457
It's better when you say it.

45:44.602 --> 45:48.671
The gypsy man,
he lives up the road.

45:48.706 --> 45:52.842
He used to live some way...
somewhere else.

45:52.877 --> 45:55.244
He lives there now.

45:55.312 --> 45:57.747
Why is he so mean?

45:57.781 --> 45:59.815
Because he used to be a rabbit,

45:59.850 --> 46:02.117
but he got turned
into a person.

46:02.152 --> 46:04.153
And that made him angry.

46:04.187 --> 46:08.056
And when he doesn't like
you, he burns you up.

46:08.091 --> 46:11.159
Does he know about us?

46:11.194 --> 46:14.329
He knows Daddy's not here.

46:14.364 --> 46:17.232
What if he comes back?

46:18.935 --> 46:21.336
Nothing's going
to happen to you.

46:21.404 --> 46:23.538
How do you know?

46:32.013 --> 46:34.147
He tries anything,

46:34.182 --> 46:36.649
I'll stick him
in the face with this

46:36.684 --> 46:38.751
and I'll kill him.

46:58.673 --> 47:00.140
Pardon me.

47:00.175 --> 47:02.109
Have we met?

47:02.143 --> 47:03.644
Right.

47:03.678 --> 47:06.381
You're the one who went
missing three days,

47:06.415 --> 47:10.084
one of which
was my opening night.

47:10.119 --> 47:13.121
If I told you where I've been,
you wouldn't believe me.

47:13.155 --> 47:15.490
I'm sure you're right.

47:15.524 --> 47:17.659
How'd it go?

47:17.693 --> 47:21.629
"As the object of
Izzy's comic affection,

47:21.664 --> 47:25.700
Billie Kent
is heaven-sent."

47:25.735 --> 47:27.569
"New York
Evening Journal."

47:29.205 --> 47:30.973
Not bad.

47:33.309 --> 47:36.978
I also got a business card.
Some movie director.

47:37.012 --> 47:39.013
What's his name?

47:41.483 --> 47:44.318
My public simply
can't get enough.

47:48.155 --> 47:49.856
Hey!

47:49.891 --> 47:51.558
She's not here.

47:51.593 --> 47:55.095
<i>Ah, but what great good</i>
<i>fortune you are, Mr. Thompson.</i>

47:55.129 --> 47:57.096
<i>Gaston Bullock Means.</i>

47:57.130 --> 47:58.731
How'd you get this number?

47:58.765 --> 48:01.366
Oh, your naughty
virgin's listed.

48:01.401 --> 48:05.004
I do hope her hospitality
exceeds that of Miss Randolph.

48:05.105 --> 48:08.907
<i>Stale coffee</i>
<i>in some greasy spoon.</i>

48:08.975 --> 48:11.043
Actually, I invited her.

48:11.077 --> 48:12.545
What do you want?

48:12.579 --> 48:15.080
To merely offer my services.

48:15.115 --> 48:19.052
As a fount of information
regarding a mutual...

48:19.086 --> 48:23.189
<i>I'm afraid the term "friend"</i>
<i>would be gilding the lily.</i>

48:23.224 --> 48:25.592
It would if you're referring
to Miss Randolph's boss.

48:25.626 --> 48:27.127
<i>Indeed I am.</i>

48:27.162 --> 48:30.231
Seems lately our Mr. Daugherty
can't retain any ally

48:30.265 --> 48:33.801
except that blubbering
walrus Jess Smith.

48:33.836 --> 48:36.304
And what would these
services set me back?

48:36.338 --> 48:40.475
<i>Well, the same 40,000 that </i>
<i>would now be gathering moss</i>

48:40.509 --> 48:44.578
<i>at the bottom of my fishbowl</i>
<i>had I met you in New York.</i>

48:44.613 --> 48:46.980
That's a lot of money
for mere information.

48:47.015 --> 48:51.017
What if, by fact, I could
introduce you and Miss Randolph

48:51.051 --> 48:53.185
to an individual who could

48:53.220 --> 48:55.120
<i>cut the Gordian knot</i>

48:55.155 --> 48:58.157
<i>that is your mutual conundrum</i>
<i>with the attorney general?</i>

48:58.191 --> 49:00.426
Tomorrow night, Atlantic City.

49:00.460 --> 49:02.295
A suite at the Ritz
will be waiting.

49:02.329 --> 49:05.731
<i>I shall pack my very best</i>
<i>bathing costume.</i>

49:05.766 --> 49:08.667
Just bring whatever
you've got on Daugherty.

49:12.606 --> 49:15.041
Big doings, Gus?

49:16.644 --> 49:19.412
Nothing worth bringing up here.

50:09.065 --> 50:11.967
- Hello?
- <i>Katy?</i>

50:12.001 --> 50:14.569
- <i>It's Mrs. Thompson.</i>
- What time is it?

50:14.603 --> 50:16.404
Late. Early.

50:16.438 --> 50:18.306
I need Mr. Sleater.

50:18.341 --> 50:20.342
<i>I thought</i>
<i>he was with you.</i>

50:20.410 --> 50:22.178
He certainly is not.

50:22.212 --> 50:24.513
<i>Sorry.</i>
<i>I don't know where he...</i>

52:16.161 --> 52:18.061
Stay where you are!

52:23.868 --> 52:26.036
This is how accidents happen.

52:27.404 --> 52:29.439
What are you doing here?

52:29.473 --> 52:31.741
Mr. Thompson called.

52:31.776 --> 52:33.943
Concerned about you
and the children.

52:33.978 --> 52:37.213
I know you sent Gareth away.

52:37.248 --> 52:38.848
You gave me a fright.

52:38.883 --> 52:41.618
<i>You gave it right back.</i>

52:41.652 --> 52:43.587
I just rang you.

52:45.590 --> 52:47.191
Here I am.

52:48.559 --> 52:50.394
You heard something?

52:50.428 --> 52:52.429
What?

52:52.463 --> 52:54.131
To come out so.

52:54.165 --> 52:56.600
I heard you.

52:56.634 --> 52:58.769
Right.

53:00.538 --> 53:03.006
Well, at least
the greenhouse is safe.

53:04.008 --> 53:05.976
After you.

53:13.485 --> 53:15.786
Could do with a lock on this.

53:15.821 --> 53:18.256
To keep the vagrants out?

53:18.290 --> 53:20.391
I wouldn't worry
much about them.

53:20.426 --> 53:22.360
Was there even one
to begin with?

53:22.394 --> 53:23.795
You can tell me.

53:23.829 --> 53:27.466
He smelled real enough,
I promise you that.

53:30.670 --> 53:34.607
I thought Teddy
started the fire,

53:34.641 --> 53:37.843
and I punished him.

53:37.877 --> 53:41.013
Ah, you're his mom.

53:42.749 --> 53:44.683
He'll forgive you.

53:47.287 --> 53:50.789
I've done what I thought
was best and wound up here.

53:50.824 --> 53:52.658
How did that happen?

53:52.692 --> 53:57.363
There's questions
best left till morning.

53:57.397 --> 53:59.832
Then why do we ask
ourselves them at night?

53:59.866 --> 54:01.800
Ah.

54:03.570 --> 54:05.738
Must be the pooka again.

54:06.806 --> 54:09.542
Now you are trying to scare me.

54:11.078 --> 54:13.713
And Katy's wondering
where you've got to.

54:13.780 --> 54:17.350
The Royal Constabulary never
kept watch on me this closely.

54:17.384 --> 54:20.419
- She doesn't want to lose you.
- Oh, aye.

54:20.454 --> 54:22.154
Up there on the shelf

54:22.189 --> 54:25.157
with the rest
of the Kewpie dolls.

54:25.192 --> 54:27.293
Does she really?

54:27.327 --> 54:29.996
And names for
every one of them.

54:37.904 --> 54:39.705
Good night.

54:40.607 --> 54:42.875
Wait.

54:55.456 --> 54:58.192
I don't think it's wise.

54:59.327 --> 55:02.096
Don't we both know
how to keep a secret?
