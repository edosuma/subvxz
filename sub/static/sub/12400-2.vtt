(GROANING, PANTING)

00:50.884 --> 00:52.340
(GASPS )

00:56.181 --> 00:57.136
Where are we?

00:58.058 --> 00:59.013
The plane.

00:59.810 --> 01:00.765
The what?

01:06.400 --> 01:08.732
Courtesy of the Udinov family trust.

01:08.860 --> 01:10.896
We've been using it
as our command center.

01:13.740 --> 01:16.402
( PANTING )
How did you--

01:16.535 --> 01:18.400
When you didn't show
at the rendezvous point,

01:18.537 --> 01:21.654
| backtracked and picked up your trail
from the crash.

01:23.667 --> 01:25.874
lt's through and through,
but you lost a lot of blood.

01:26.169 --> 01:27.750
You're gonna feel faint.

01:29.798 --> 01:32.289
I had to cut your shirt off
to get to the wound.

01:32.509 --> 01:33.794
Ryan: Seymour.
(OVERLAPPING CHATTER)

01:33.885 --> 01:35.591
No, let's let her rest.

01:35.971 --> 01:37.677
Seymour: Nikki.
- Nerd.

01:46.607 --> 01:47.596
Hey.

01:48.900 --> 01:50.856
Wasn't sure
we'd see you alive again.

01:51.903 --> 01:52.892
Glad we did.

01:53.989 --> 01:55.445
Who else is here?

01:56.241 --> 01:57.572
Right now, this is it.

01:57.701 --> 02:00.067
- Who's flying the plane?
- (ALL ) Autopilot.

02:03.915 --> 02:05.496
Right now,
we're halfway to DC.

02:06.293 --> 02:07.373
VVhy?

02:09.588 --> 02:12.295
There's something
you should see.

02:14.343 --> 02:16.755
At this point, I can conﬁrm
that presidential assassin

02:16.928 --> 02:20.921
Nikita Mears was the individual
who planted the explosive device

02:21.058 --> 02:24.721
resulting in the death
of ENN journalist Dale Gordon.

02:25.437 --> 02:27.803
We also believe
that we have uncovered

02:27.939 --> 02:29.019
the motive for the killing.

02:29.149 --> 02:32.641
According to his notes,
Mr. Gordon was set

02:32.778 --> 02:36.270
to report on evidence
of an offshore Cayman account

02:36.406 --> 02:39.022
that, according to NSA,
was in Nikita Mears's name.

02:39.159 --> 02:40.774
That's a lie.

02:41.828 --> 02:43.819
Graham must have planted
that evidence on Dale

02:43.955 --> 02:44.990
right after he killed him.

02:47.292 --> 02:50.830
I told Dale to go straight
to the head of the FBI.

02:51.838 --> 02:53.453
- I'm the reason he's dead.
- No.

02:53.590 --> 02:54.830
He's dead because of Amanda.

02:54.966 --> 02:56.547
She's the one
controlling Graham.

02:56.677 --> 02:58.633
Yeah, but how?
How is she doing this?

02:58.762 --> 03:00.548
- How is she doing any of this?
- I think I know.

03:02.974 --> 03:04.760
The Deputy Director
of the FBI,

03:06.019 --> 03:08.852
a German BND officer,
a secret service supervisor,

03:08.980 --> 03:10.845
and the president
of the United States.

03:10.982 --> 03:12.017
All high level.

03:12.150 --> 03:13.185
All seemingly incorruptible,

03:13.360 --> 03:15.476
yet all clearly compromised.
How?

03:17.406 --> 03:18.566
Well,
if Amanda drugged them,

03:18.740 --> 03:20.276
she could have gotten them
in her chair,

03:20.409 --> 03:21.740
stuck her needle in their heads?

03:21.868 --> 03:23.483
Amanda's needling
takes several hours,

03:23.662 --> 03:24.777
half a day at least.

03:25.163 --> 03:26.869
Any of these people
disappear for that long,

03:27.207 --> 03:28.242
they would have been noticed.

03:28.542 --> 03:30.157
So how did she brainwash them?

03:30.752 --> 03:32.993
She didn't.
She switched them.

03:34.798 --> 03:35.878
Switched?

03:37.634 --> 03:38.419
A double.

03:39.970 --> 03:42.211
A perfect replica.

03:44.015 --> 03:46.006
Someone who's been physically

03:46.184 --> 03:48.971
and mentally altered
to act as a replacement.

03:51.815 --> 03:54.181
Uh...
Look, Ryan, I know

03:54.359 --> 03:56.020
you're the conspiracy guy
and everything,

03:56.194 --> 03:58.105
- but all this sounds a little--
- Hard to believe?

03:58.238 --> 03:59.273
It would be,
if we didn't know

03:59.406 --> 04:01.146
the Shop already
had the tech for it.

04:01.867 --> 04:03.983
Polymers that can make copies
of someone's face,

04:04.536 --> 04:06.993
body parts regenerated
from source DNA,

04:07.247 --> 04:09.579
and now, Amanda
is working with them.

04:11.334 --> 04:13.996
She can install psychic circuit breakers
into a person's head,

04:14.171 --> 04:16.002
make subjects suggestible
andloyaL

04:16.423 --> 04:18.755
The way she turned Sam into Owen.

04:19.259 --> 04:22.422
Put it all together,
and you got a system

04:22.554 --> 04:24.419
to create the perfect
undercover operative.

04:24.556 --> 04:27.593
They look and act
exactly like the real thing,

04:27.934 --> 04:30.220
enough to fool even
the people closest to them.

04:31.688 --> 04:33.349
Placed in the right positions,
these operatives

04:33.482 --> 04:36.224
would give the Shop incredible
access and power.

04:40.906 --> 04:42.988
It came together for me
after Alex intercepted

04:43.116 --> 04:46.108
the Shop's latest shipment--
four Pakistani men,

04:46.244 --> 04:47.620
all the same physical type.

04:50.123 --> 04:52.705
They're not looking
for random slaves.

04:53.126 --> 04:55.117
They're looking
for a specific type of clay

04:55.337 --> 04:57.373
to mold
into a pre-existing form.

04:57.547 --> 04:58.662
How did she find that out?

04:58.799 --> 05:00.790
She's been chasing
human traffickers.

05:00.967 --> 05:02.298
Ones with connection
to the Shop.

05:02.511 --> 05:04.342
- By herself?
- Sonya's with her.

05:04.596 --> 05:05.460
Anyway, it's Alex.

05:05.597 --> 05:06.928
She knows how to take care
of herself.

05:13.355 --> 05:15.186
Shouldn't you be
on a beach somewhere,

05:15.398 --> 05:16.808
doing whatever
retired cleaners do?

05:16.942 --> 05:19.809
It got boring.
Turns out, | freckle.

05:19.945 --> 05:21.526
And you couldn't think
of anything else to do

05:21.655 --> 05:22.485
with your stolen money?

05:22.572 --> 05:25.439
Stolen?
I earned that money.

05:26.368 --> 05:27.653
That's payback
for ten whole years

05:27.786 --> 05:29.572
Amanda's brain rape
stole from me.

05:29.746 --> 05:31.828
300 million
is pretty good payback.

05:33.834 --> 05:34.698
It's a start.

05:36.044 --> 05:37.409
So you just got bored...

05:38.755 --> 05:39.790
Decided to come to Mumbai

05:39.923 --> 05:41.254
and hunt human traffickers?

05:41.341 --> 05:44.128
No.
I decided to come to Mumbai

05:44.302 --> 05:47.590
to hunt Russian heiresses
who hunt human traffickers.

05:48.807 --> 05:49.967
VVhy?

05:50.141 --> 05:52.723
'Cause you're my best shot
at finding Amanda.

05:54.604 --> 05:55.810
She made me
look like a fool,

05:55.939 --> 05:57.554
first by turning me
into Owen,

05:57.983 --> 06:00.770
then by playing me
at the G20 back in Toronto.

06:01.903 --> 06:03.689
I knew you guys would
be looking for her too,

06:04.573 --> 06:06.109
so I've been following you.

06:06.366 --> 06:08.402
I saw you take that scanner

06:08.535 --> 06:09.695
off one of her operatives.

06:09.828 --> 06:11.614
First solid lead I've seen
in months,

06:12.747 --> 06:14.612
and you're gonna give it
to me.

06:14.875 --> 06:15.910
The data on this

06:16.001 --> 06:17.957
could lead us to the people
who framed Nikita.

06:18.378 --> 06:20.243
- We need this.
- I'm not asking.

06:23.466 --> 06:24.967
(RAPID GUNFIRE)

06:25.093 --> 06:26.048
Go, go, go, go, go!

06:29.431 --> 06:31.262
More traffickers looking for their pals.

06:32.893 --> 06:35.350
(MEN SHOUTING)

06:37.480 --> 06:39.516
- Uh!
- Give me a gun!

06:41.443 --> 06:42.899
Owen!

06:49.075 --> 06:50.531
Unh!

06:56.041 --> 06:59.033
(SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE
OFFSCREEN )

07:00.211 --> 07:02.588
l was on my way
out of here.

07:06.051 --> 07:07.666
The car was abandoned
on the west side.

07:07.844 --> 07:09.380
We've got a 50-block cordon
around the area.

07:09.512 --> 07:11.252
It won't matter.
She's gone.

07:11.681 --> 07:13.842
She's wounded.
She'll need medical attention.

07:14.142 --> 07:15.177
After what she just pulled,

07:15.352 --> 07:16.842
she won't stick her head up
for anything,

07:17.020 --> 07:18.681
not for a very long time.

07:18.980 --> 07:21.016
Sir, you've got a call.
lt's Nikita.

07:22.400 --> 07:24.311
Sir, the call is right here.

07:25.612 --> 07:27.443
Hey!
Keep it down!

07:27.656 --> 07:28.941
Put her on.

07:29.991 --> 07:30.855
This is Graham.

07:31.076 --> 07:32.111
( NIKITA )You know,
you really had me fooled

07:32.243 --> 07:33.744
saying you were looking
for the truth.

07:34.829 --> 07:36.865
I didn't realize you were
hiding it about yourself.

07:37.248 --> 07:38.499
You're injured.
Turn yourself in.

07:38.625 --> 07:40.115
I promise
you'll be taken care of.

07:40.293 --> 07:42.033
Oh, you mean the way
you took care of Dale Gordon?

07:42.295 --> 07:43.705
No one else has to
get hurt.

07:43.880 --> 07:45.336
Nikita: I'm going to expose you
for who you really are.

07:45.507 --> 07:46.542
Matthew: I don 't know
what you hope to accomplish.

07:46.758 --> 07:49.090
To everyone listening in,
the man claiming

07:49.260 --> 07:51.421
to be Deputy Director Graham
is an impostor.

07:51.721 --> 07:53.757
I'm sure many of you
have noticed

07:53.974 --> 07:54.963
that he's been a little off.

07:55.225 --> 07:56.715
Lapses in routine.

07:56.935 --> 07:58.266
Have any of you asked him

07:58.395 --> 08:00.306
who he's been talking to
on his private phone?

08:01.106 --> 08:03.973
Listen to me.
I am gonna find you.

08:04.150 --> 08:05.310
How long do you think
you can keep running?

08:05.610 --> 08:07.225
No, no, no, I don't think
you're hearing me.

08:07.362 --> 08:09.318
I've been on the run
for three months,

08:09.447 --> 08:11.153
from you, from my life.

08:11.324 --> 08:13.360
l have given up everything

08:13.618 --> 08:15.654
for even a shred of the truth,
and now l have it.

08:15.996 --> 08:17.486
So I'm not chasing shadows anymore.

08:17.664 --> 08:19.529
l have a point of attack.

08:21.209 --> 08:22.540
You.

08:35.807 --> 08:37.138
I count four.

08:37.267 --> 08:39.633
- Two cover positions.
- They're waiting us out.

08:39.769 --> 08:41.805
Probably expecting reinforcements.

08:41.938 --> 08:44.099
We should get out of here
before they arrive.

08:45.859 --> 08:47.599
We need to make it
to that van.

08:48.278 --> 08:51.486
With the cover they have?
That'd be suicide.

08:54.200 --> 08:55.861
Sonya, are you there?

08:56.661 --> 08:57.650
Sonya ?

08:57.912 --> 08:58.571
Son ya!

08:58.872 --> 09:00.988
Alex! Why aren't you
on your way back?

09:02.083 --> 09:02.868
Got held up.

09:03.043 --> 09:04.453
- We need your help.
_ "We"?

09:04.586 --> 09:07.043
- Me and Owen.
- Owen?

09:07.213 --> 09:08.498
- I mean, Sam.
- What's he--

09:08.631 --> 09:09.711
Later.
Look, we got pinned down

09:09.883 --> 09:10.872
by Priya's men.

09:11.051 --> 09:13.212
We need some sort of distraction
to get past them.

09:23.104 --> 09:24.844
I think I can hack
the power grid

09:24.981 --> 09:26.061
and shut down the lights.

09:26.191 --> 09:28.273
- Will that give you enough cover?
- I think so.

09:29.277 --> 09:31.063
We need to take out
the headlights.

09:31.237 --> 09:32.898
All right.
You take the left,

09:33.073 --> 09:34.153
I got the right.

09:35.075 --> 09:38.238
Look, | get it.
You want vengeance.

09:38.411 --> 09:39.651
After what Amanda did
to you,

09:39.788 --> 09:42.029
I would feel the same way,
so I get what you're doing.

09:43.166 --> 09:44.747
But that doesn't mean
I trust you.

09:44.876 --> 09:47.913
That's okay.
I don't trust you either.

09:49.255 --> 09:50.995
So we've got that in common.

09:52.967 --> 09:54.707
Sonya, do it.

10:08.983 --> 10:10.109
Alex!

10:11.820 --> 10:13.401
Uh!

10:20.245 --> 10:21.781
(GROANING)

10:27.127 --> 10:28.207
You shot me!

10:28.336 --> 10:29.200
In the Kevlar.

10:29.337 --> 10:32.204
I knocked you
out of his line of fire.

10:33.675 --> 10:35.586
How did you know I had it on?

10:35.718 --> 10:36.878
Standard mission protocol.

10:37.011 --> 10:39.263
And you're the kind
to keep to protocol.

10:39.389 --> 10:41.300
Meaning you guessed.

10:42.934 --> 10:45.095
Next time,
give me a heads-up.

10:48.314 --> 10:50.600
I said, "Alex."

10:50.733 --> 10:53.395
No, l-l don't think
anyone believes her.

10:54.237 --> 10:55.898
She didn't expect them to.

10:56.030 --> 10:57.315
She called you
to let me know

10:57.490 --> 10:59.105
she's back in the game.

10:59.242 --> 11:01.403
Do I proceed
with Alpha contingency?

11:01.536 --> 11:04.323
No, she's trying
to get you to react,

11:04.455 --> 11:06.286
force you into a false move.

11:06.416 --> 11:08.247
Your name is
Matthew Graham.

11:08.376 --> 11:10.241
You're the Deputy Director
of the FBI.

11:10.378 --> 11:12.994
You have a duty to your office
and to your country

11:13.173 --> 11:14.788
and to me.

11:16.176 --> 11:18.132
This is important work
we're doing.

11:18.970 --> 11:20.255
Mm.

11:22.348 --> 11:25.306
Nikita's been living under
the glare of the spotlight.

11:25.393 --> 11:26.974
Now she thinks
there may be a way

11:27.103 --> 11:29.344
to use it to her advantage.

11:29.480 --> 11:32.187
Well, I'm going to make sure
it stays on her.

11:32.942 --> 11:35.558
I'm going to make sure
it sears her.

11:36.905 --> 11:38.190
Michael: What's Amanda trying to do

11:38.364 --> 11:39.695
with this lie
about the secret account?

11:39.824 --> 11:41.485
Establish a context.

11:42.368 --> 11:44.825
Create a narrative
for Spencer's assassination.

11:45.788 --> 11:47.824
Yeah, but why?

11:47.957 --> 11:48.992
We thought
killing the president

11:49.125 --> 11:50.035
was the endgame for the Shop,

11:50.210 --> 11:53.122
but maybe
it's just the beginning.

11:53.254 --> 11:55.540
This doesn't feel like Amanda.

11:55.715 --> 11:58.001
It's too subtle.

11:59.552 --> 12:01.338
This is someone else.

12:01.512 --> 12:02.672
Someone who knows
how to maneuver

12:02.764 --> 12:03.879
in the financial sector.

12:04.057 --> 12:06.218
Someone who's used to power

12:06.392 --> 12:09.634
but comfortable staying
in the shadows.

12:10.605 --> 12:12.015
( man ) And no other voices
could be heard

12:12.190 --> 12:13.225
on Nikita's side of the call?

12:13.358 --> 12:15.895
No, sir, audio forensics
were inconclusive.

12:16.027 --> 12:18.359
I'm assuming the FBI
tried to trace the signal.

12:18.488 --> 12:20.319
They did,
but without any success.

12:20.865 --> 12:23.402
How did they discover
the double?

12:23.534 --> 12:25.070
We left no loose ends.

12:25.203 --> 12:27.740
Nikita has proven
to be very resourceful.

12:27.914 --> 12:31.077
No.
No, this is beyond her.

12:31.251 --> 12:34.084
Figuring out something
like this is--

12:34.254 --> 12:36.415
it's a much more abstract level
of thought.

12:56.484 --> 12:58.896
Ugh, that's gnarly.

12:59.737 --> 13:01.273
Could have been a lot worse.

Mikey got to you when he did.

13:05.368 --> 13:06.448
Lucky.

13:08.162 --> 13:10.539
Not so much
for Dale Gordon, huh?

13:12.250 --> 13:14.616
Graham had everybody fooled.
You couldn't have known.

13:14.794 --> 13:17.035
Yeah, but I'm the one
who got Dale involved.

13:19.007 --> 13:20.622
I'm always the one.

13:23.678 --> 13:25.794
You know, when l was out there,
Nerd, l was so careful.

13:25.930 --> 13:28.763
So careful,
I just--| kept my head down,

13:28.891 --> 13:30.631
and I kept going.

13:30.768 --> 13:33.259
I didn't contact anyone,
because I knew that if I did...

13:34.188 --> 13:35.689
...that someone would get hurt.

13:36.524 --> 13:38.435
That's why I left
in the first place.

13:38.568 --> 13:41.981
Who else is going to get hurt
because of me if I stay?

13:47.535 --> 13:49.321
Nikita: How is he?

13:51.205 --> 13:53.947
He's a lot more focused
than I've seen him in a while.

13:58.254 --> 14:00.210
I know when I left,
I hurt him.

14:01.591 --> 14:03.206
It hurt me too.

14:06.137 --> 14:07.627
Did he say anything?

14:08.556 --> 14:11.798
- After I left?
- About you?

14:18.024 --> 14:20.356
- He didn't say anything.
- Not once?

14:20.818 --> 14:22.433
Not in front of us.

14:41.047 --> 14:41.797
Oh, sorry, darling.

to make dinner.

ran late.

Is everything okay?

14:58.689 --> 15:00.725
Yes, of course.
I just--

15:01.401 --> 15:03.483
I wanted to thank you
for everything,

just joining us, we are live

15:46.654 --> 15:50.112
outside the residence
of FBI Deputy Director Matthew Graham,

15:50.283 --> 15:53.400
where earlier tonight
an attempt was made on Graham '8 life.

15:53.536 --> 15:55.072
According
to preliminary reports,

15:55.204 --> 15:56.785
shots were ﬁred
into the home,

15:56.956 --> 15:59.288
wounding Graham
and killing his wife Sarah.

15:59.459 --> 16:02.041
Authorities are still piecing
together the evidence,

16:02.170 --> 16:03.956
but a source close
to the investigation

16:04.088 --> 16:05.953
tells us that the FBI
believes this to be

16:06.132 --> 16:08.418
the work of assassin
Nikita Mears.

16:08.551 --> 16:09.256
( MAN, ON TV)
Thank you for that update.

16:09.385 --> 16:10.591
We wanted a response.

16:10.720 --> 16:12.711
- We got a response.
- No, this is all wrong.

16:12.847 --> 16:14.257
This is too loud
for the Shop.

16:14.390 --> 16:15.300
But not for Amanda.

16:15.433 --> 16:17.094
This is over the top,
even for her.

16:17.226 --> 16:18.636
We put the spotlight
on Graham.

16:18.769 --> 16:20.305
Amanda shoved it back
to Nikita.

16:20.438 --> 16:22.474
She's really playing hardball.

16:23.941 --> 16:25.602
Then it's time we did the same.

16:25.985 --> 16:28.226
lf Graham is a double,
we expose him to the world.

16:29.655 --> 16:31.316
We have no physical proof.

16:31.491 --> 16:32.981
The FBI,
they have to have a sample

16:33.117 --> 16:34.653
of the real Graham's DNA, right?

16:35.036 --> 16:35.946
Sure.

16:36.412 --> 16:38.403
All personnel are required
to provide one.

16:38.539 --> 16:40.325
Then we have them compare it
to what's on file,

16:40.500 --> 16:41.740
to the impostor's DNA.

16:41.876 --> 16:44.288
I don't think the double
is going to cooperate.

16:44.378 --> 16:45.663
So we don't give him
a choice.

16:47.715 --> 16:50.707
The FBI has to take a DNA sample
while they're doing an autopsy.

16:51.427 --> 16:54.043
You want to kill
the Deputy Director of the FBI?

16:54.388 --> 16:55.639
Amanda already did that.

16:58.100 --> 17:00.056
She wants the world
to see me as an assassin?

17:00.937 --> 17:02.473
Let's give her
what she wants.

17:06.859 --> 17:08.599

as has the media presence.

17:13.032 --> 17:15.364

be insanely hard.

17:15.535 --> 17:18.447
Getting close without being seen,
forget about it.

17:18.579 --> 17:20.365
Standard kill protocols
won't work,

17:20.540 --> 17:21.575
not with our limited resources.

17:21.832 --> 17:23.117
We're gonna have to run a bluff.

17:23.501 --> 17:24.536
Get him out of there,
or at least,

17:24.710 --> 17:26.996
get him to want
to come out of there.

17:28.172 --> 17:30.208
This only works
as a two-man op.

37:11.980 --> 37:13.470
(GRUNTS, PANTS )

37:18.695 --> 37:19.525
Come on, come one, move!

37:19.654 --> 37:20.643
- Hey, hey, hey!
- We gotta help-

37:20.780 --> 37:21.735
Listen to me.
We can't do anything

37:21.865 --> 37:23.071
from inside a cell!
Let's clear out,

37:23.199 --> 37:25.235
and we can figure it out,
but right now, we gotta go!

37:25.368 --> 37:26.118
Go!

37:30.165 --> 37:31.405
Authorities are
still investigating

37:31.541 --> 37:33.156
Graham '8 Shocking murder.

37:33.293 --> 37:36.080
One piece of the puzzle
they're analyzing is the video,

37:36.212 --> 37:38.954
sent to news outlets
Shortly after the attack.

37:40.550 --> 37:43.417
I apologize for taking
such a drastic action,

37:43.553 --> 37:44.668
but the man calling himself

37:44.804 --> 37:47.136
Matthew Graham was not
who he said he was.

37:47.307 --> 37:50.925
I am so sure of that
that I will make this offer.

37:51.060 --> 37:52.470
Do a DNA test on his body

37:52.645 --> 37:54.385
and compare it to the samples
already on ﬁle.

37:54.522 --> 37:57.434
Do that,
and I will turn myself in.

37:57.567 --> 37:58.807
This is exactly
the sort of undue attention

37:58.985 --> 38:00.521
we sought to avoid.

38:00.653 --> 38:04.020
DNA tests, autopsies,
contingencies we've planned for.

38:04.157 --> 38:06.614
Taking established protocols
into account.

38:06.743 --> 38:09.325
Not the volatile movements
of Nikita.

38:10.997 --> 38:11.986
I have to admit,

38:12.165 --> 38:14.998
I was a bit surprised
she pulled the trigger.

38:15.168 --> 38:17.830
Perhaps she really
has changed.

38:30.350 --> 38:31.635
Michael...

38:34.354 --> 38:35.890
Thank you.

38:36.523 --> 38:38.559
I know there are going
to be casualties in this war,

38:38.733 --> 38:40.348
but today,

38:40.777 --> 38:43.519
I didn't have to be a killer
because of you.

38:50.870 --> 38:52.280
You know, the hardest part
about being out there

38:52.413 --> 38:54.745
was seeing myself
on those wanted posters.

38:55.708 --> 38:59.166
This constant reminder
of my worst fear,

39:00.922 --> 39:03.413
that all I am
is what Division made me.

39:05.343 --> 39:07.800
Division doesn't define
any of us anymore.

39:09.055 --> 39:10.420
We fight
because we want to.

39:11.224 --> 39:13.260
And because we're here
for each other.

39:13.434 --> 39:14.514
That's why we're a team.

39:14.644 --> 39:16.885
Michael, can we stop talking
about the team, please?

39:19.774 --> 39:22.607
Nikita, there's a reason
why I'm talking about the team.

39:24.737 --> 39:26.944
I'm still here to help you,

39:27.240 --> 39:28.980
and I always will.

39:30.118 --> 39:33.451
And I'm still here
to fight Amanda and the Shop.

39:38.918 --> 39:41.125
But I am done
fighting for us.

39:53.641 --> 39:55.506
( MAN ) No matter
how the FBI autopsy plays out,

39:55.643 --> 39:58.555
this has already forced us
to accelerate our timeline.

40:00.106 --> 40:02.267
Revealing Alexandra Udinov
as the third party

40:02.442 --> 40:04.057
who helped Pakistan
finance the assassination

40:04.193 --> 40:05.603
was not supposed
to have happened until later.

40:06.279 --> 40:09.066
Does it really matter?

40:09.198 --> 40:12.565
It's not like Alex can deny
she's funding Nikita.

40:12.702 --> 40:15.535
A look at the Udinov accounts
will show she's been financing

40:15.663 --> 40:17.403
their little band for months.

40:18.750 --> 40:20.411
How are they going
to fight the truth, hmm?

40:20.543 --> 40:21.578
The projects
we have under way

40:21.711 --> 40:23.326
are overlapping
and interdependent.

40:23.463 --> 40:25.328
That is why timing
is so important.

40:26.132 --> 40:27.872
Graham had
more of a part to play.

40:28.301 --> 40:29.962
Then we'll adjust.

40:30.136 --> 40:33.299
Don't forget, we still have
one more ace in the hole,

40:34.140 --> 40:36.802
and his mission isjust beginning.

41:03.336 --> 41:04.041
Ryan: Birkhoff.

41:04.212 --> 41:05.793
How's the NSA search going?

41:07.006 --> 41:08.667
You find
any doppelgangers yet?

41:08.841 --> 41:11.423
Not yet, Shadowbot's
still doing his thing.

41:11.552 --> 41:13.088
lguess
you're just gonna have to wait.
