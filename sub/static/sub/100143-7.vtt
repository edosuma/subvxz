00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
There was a young praefectus.

00:02.000 --> 00:05.000
Out of my way! Move!

00:05.000 --> 00:06.000
Lucius Validus.

00:08.000 --> 00:11.000
And no one knows where he went.

00:11.000 --> 00:12.000
No one.

00:12.000 --> 00:14.000
Strange.

00:17.000 --> 00:20.000
Many have turned their heads
from the Veran.

00:23.000 --> 00:25.000
Led into darkness by the dark itself.

00:31.000 --> 00:34.000
They've sworn their allegiance
to the Dead Man.

00:36.000 --> 00:41.000
He will soon join forces with Lokka
and take these lands.

01:00.000 --> 01:03.000
By the way,
the Dead Man stands alone.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
Well played, brother.

01:14.000 --> 01:15.000
Well played.

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
Do you know what they're saying
about you?

01:38.000 --> 01:41.000
You're cursed.

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
You have a hex on your back.

01:44.000 --> 01:47.000
The Druids spared you to send you back
to destroy us all.

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
They're wrong.

01:51.000 --> 01:54.000
So why aren't you dead
like everyone else?

01:54.000 --> 01:59.000
-They spared me to tell... the story.
-Story?

01:59.000 --> 02:02.000
-Of what happened.
They wanted you to know.

02:05.000 --> 02:07.000
What's all this?

02:10.000 --> 02:14.000
-They did it.
-You know what? It rather suits you.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
I didn't think to stop for a bath.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
Well, you always were the lucky one.

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
I've been captured, tortured.

02:24.000 --> 02:25.000
And yet here you are.

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
So, what's in the bag, lucky man?

02:39.000 --> 02:42.000
This mark was on the forehead
of every fallen man.

02:44.000 --> 02:47.000
Oh, Vitus, I take it all back.

02:52.000 --> 02:55.000
Now we're fucking talking.

03:06.000 --> 03:09.000
When I look out my window

03:11.000 --> 03:14.000
Many sights to see

03:16.000 --> 03:19.000
And when I look in my window

03:21.000 --> 03:25.000
So many different people to be

03:25.000 --> 03:32.000
Oh, no
Must be the season of the witch

03:32.000 --> 03:37.000
Must be the season of the witch, yeah

03:37.000 --> 03:41.000
Must be the season of the witch

03:49.000 --> 03:52.000
You got to pick up every stitch

03:54.000 --> 03:58.000
The rabbits running in the ditch

03:59.000 --> 04:02.000
Beatniks are out to make it rich

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
Something bothering you, friend?

04:25.000 --> 04:26.000
Why did they have to die?

04:29.000 --> 04:32.000
You mean those young men you brought?
-They were children.

04:33.000 --> 04:36.000
-Aren't we all?
-Not them. Not any more.

04:36.000 --> 04:39.000
You don't understand the first thing
about this world, do you?

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
No.

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
No, I don't.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
I absolutely do not.

04:59.000 --> 05:02.000
Why don't you tell me
the first thing about this world?

05:02.000 --> 05:07.000
Good. So, to understand this world,
you need to understand three things.

05:07.000 --> 05:11.000
First thing, everything
which is born will die.

05:12.000 --> 05:15.000
-Not like that.
-Just like that.

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
Because everything is a sacrifice.

05:18.000 --> 05:21.000
The trees, the leaves, the butterflies.

05:21.000 --> 05:24.000
When you accept it, you understand
the first thing about this world.

05:25.000 --> 05:31.000
The second thing is that everything,
absolutely everything, is true.

05:32.000 --> 05:36.000
You said you thought your sister
returned to punish you, she did.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
You said you abandoned her, you did.

05:38.000 --> 05:41.000
You said you abandoned your babies,
you did.

05:41.000 --> 05:45.000
You said you were confused,
lost, weak, stupid. You are.

05:46.000 --> 05:51.000
Am I here to help you?
To show you the way?

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
Yes, I am.

05:53.000 --> 05:57.000
Am I here to destroy you? Absolutely.

05:58.000 --> 05:59.000
Do I love you?

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
With all my heart and soul.

06:06.000 --> 06:10.000
Do I despise you?
With all my heart and soul...

06:10.000 --> 06:13.000
-What's the third thing?
-The third thing...

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
This is the third thing.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
Watch very carefully.

06:30.000 --> 06:33.000
The third and most important thing.

06:44.000 --> 06:47.000
Thanks, that's really cleared things up
for me.

06:47.000 --> 06:50.000
Anytime, friend. Anytime.

07:03.000 --> 07:08.000
Until I return, you, Praefectus,
you are in single charge of the castrum.

07:08.000 --> 07:13.000
-But where are you going?
-To see an old friend.

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
Dismount.

07:16.000 --> 07:20.000
Hear this. I leave Vitus Aurelius
in command.

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
Keep an eye on the emperor's pet pig
over there.

07:25.000 --> 07:29.000
-I don't trust that fucker an inch.
-All hail General Aulus!

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
Hail Aulus!

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
Hail Aulus!

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
Another mysterious leave of absence?

07:36.000 --> 07:39.000
-Well, an intelligence breakthrough.
-One you're itching to share.

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
Oh, we all have our roles, Domitius.

07:42.000 --> 07:45.000
Oh, talking of which. My Praefectus.

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
He's been a bit wonky since his return.

07:48.000 --> 07:52.000
-Keep an eye on him for me.
-Our acting commander bit wonky?

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
I don't trust that fucker an inch.

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
-Where are you going?
-On the hunt.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
I have something for you. Come.

08:14.000 --> 08:17.000
Bay, chamomile, ginger.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
They're hunting. I'm drinking tea?

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
Do you miss your child?

08:27.000 --> 08:30.000
-It was the will of the gods.
-But you miss him.

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
-Is this a test?
-Of what?

08:34.000 --> 08:37.000
My loyalty to the Dead Man.

08:37.000 --> 08:40.000
To give up a child
is the hardest thing a woman can do.

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
I know where your heart lies.

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
As do the gods.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
Did you have a child?

08:54.000 --> 08:58.000
-I prefer women.
-And why is that?

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
Better kissers,
and they don't give you babies.

09:00.000 --> 09:03.000
-Better kissers, how?
-I'd have to show you.

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
Then show me.

09:10.000 --> 09:13.000
-The Dead Man decides who we lie with.
-I said kiss.

09:20.000 --> 09:21.000
-Is this a test?
-Of what?

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
My loyalty to the Dead Man.

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
-Who was that man?
-What man?

10:23.000 --> 10:27.000
With the Dead Man's corpse,
tall, fair hair.

10:27.000 --> 10:30.000
A Cantii slave my tribe
owned from a boy.

10:30.000 --> 10:35.000
-He didn't have the bearing of a slave.
-He was high born. Captured in battle.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
What did you say to him?

10:37.000 --> 10:41.000
-You ask a lot of questions.
-You don't.

10:42.000 --> 10:46.000
Well, here's one.
What's the Dead Man's plan?

10:49.000 --> 10:52.000
The Dead Man keeps his own counsel.

10:52.000 --> 10:55.000
Hey, if you don't trust me,
I'll just have to tell him what we did.

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
What's wrong?

10:59.000 --> 11:02.000
-What I know will bring you pain.
-Why?

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
Veran is on the run.

11:07.000 --> 11:10.000
We have riders hunting him
and his followers.

11:10.000 --> 11:14.000
When we find them,
we slay everything loyal to Veran.

11:14.000 --> 11:18.000
Every man. Woman. And child.

11:19.000 --> 11:22.000
-You have nothing to fear.
-Ania...

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
It's a choice I made over my child.

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
Will you cut your child's throat?

11:26.000 --> 11:29.000
Because that is what it may come to.

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
My path is clear.

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
Tell Veran I must speak with him.

11:44.000 --> 11:47.000
My Queen, the Veran has vanished.

11:51.000 --> 11:54.000
Send out more riders.

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
Search for him everywhere.

12:29.000 --> 12:33.000
All hail Emperor Aulus!

12:40.000 --> 12:44.000
So, General, I have a question
to ask of you.

12:46.000 --> 12:49.000
Are you the devil?
Or do you just work for him?

13:21.000 --> 13:24.000
When the hunt returns, we'll need salt.

13:24.000 --> 13:27.000
I'll ride to the coast.
I'll be back in two days.

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
-I'll send someone.
-Don't you trust me?

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
-Two days.
-Don't worry.

13:33.000 --> 13:37.000
-Your secret's safe. Our secret.
-My secret?

13:53.000 --> 13:56.000
I bet the view's even better
from up there, eh, buddy?

14:01.000 --> 14:04.000
Beautiful!

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
Praefectus. There you are.

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
What are you doing?

14:23.000 --> 14:27.000
-Fancy a drop? It's good stuff.
-You're drunk.

14:29.000 --> 14:33.000
Come on.
We both know you'd piss in it.

14:33.000 --> 14:36.000
This dereliction of duty is duly noted.

14:36.000 --> 14:40.000
This dereliction of duly is duty noted.
This dela...

14:44.000 --> 14:45.000
How does it go again?

14:45.000 --> 14:49.000
-You're a disgrace to this legion.
-Asked you to watch me, did he?

14:50.000 --> 14:51.000
Relax.

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
He asked me to watch you too.

14:55.000 --> 14:59.000
"Keep an eye on him.
Don't trust that fucker an inch."

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
So, here we are. Both doing our jobs.

15:04.000 --> 15:07.000
Seems we have something in common.

15:08.000 --> 15:11.000
Our general doesn't trust us.

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
I came not to spy,

15:13.000 --> 15:16.000
but to ask a question of one
I thought had more sense.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
Well, I'm all ears, mate.

15:21.000 --> 15:25.000
The decision to press west.

15:26.000 --> 15:27.000
What was the objective?

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
-Hunting ghosts.
-Ghosts?

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
Demons. Prophecies. You name it.

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
Found only slaughter. Carnage...

15:37.000 --> 15:41.000
-Black magic. Can't you smell it?
-Magic?

15:50.000 --> 15:54.000
-What's this?
-How the Druids send their invitations.

15:54.000 --> 15:57.000
-Where did he go?
-To visit an old friend.

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
Who knows who his friends are now.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
What's this symbol?

16:03.000 --> 16:04.000
Never seen it before.

16:06.000 --> 16:10.000
-Whoops.
-What is this?

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
Property of General Aulus Plautius.

16:13.000 --> 16:18.000
Sober up. Get some rest.
Then come to my quarters.

16:19.000 --> 16:22.000
It's time you told me everything you
know about our friend, the general.

19:02.000 --> 19:05.000
-Who are these men?
-Envoys of the Senate of Rome.

19:05.000 --> 19:08.000
-I thought we'd be alone.
-Have you made a decision?

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
I have.

19:18.000 --> 19:21.000
These men are here
to witness your testimony.

19:21.000 --> 19:26.000
It must be set down with formality
if it is to stand before tribunal.

19:26.000 --> 19:30.000
Then, the Senate.
Finally, the emperor himself.

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
Now, from the beginning,

19:34.000 --> 19:38.000
tell us everything you know
about General Aulus Plautius.

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
Harka made us attack the Roman camp.

20:18.000 --> 20:21.000
They were unready. It was a massacre.

20:24.000 --> 20:28.000
The attack was not on Rome.
It was on me.

20:29.000 --> 20:32.000
-I don't understand.
-It was my brother's invocation.

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
His invitation.

20:37.000 --> 20:41.000
-Start of an alliance.
-Alliance? Between who?

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
Our two darkest foes.

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
Three trees on a hill

20:58.000 --> 21:01.000
No leaves on the trees

21:01.000 --> 21:04.000
Two dogs and a lamb

21:04.000 --> 21:08.000
For a world on its knees

21:08.000 --> 21:11.000
All love in this world

21:11.000 --> 21:14.000
Is the love that he gave

21:14.000 --> 21:17.000
We are all of one heart

21:17.000 --> 21:22.000
One mother, one grave

21:25.000 --> 21:28.000
You're a hard bird to find...

21:29.000 --> 21:32.000
...Lucius Validus.

21:33.000 --> 21:36.000
A very hard bird.

21:43.000 --> 21:44.000
Josephus?

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
The Dead Man has riders out
searching for this camp.

21:52.000 --> 21:56.000
If they discover it, they are
to slaughter every one they find.

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
You fear for your child.

22:00.000 --> 22:03.000
-I would do only the Gods' will.
-Then you must do it.

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
Go to the traitors' camp
and tell them you found us.

22:06.000 --> 22:09.000
-But they will kill you.
-You must return with something.

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
They'll press you. Try to unmask you.

22:14.000 --> 22:19.000
-Tell them of this place.
-I understand. You'll move on.

22:19.000 --> 22:22.000
But they'll know you were here.
They'll track you down.

22:24.000 --> 22:28.000
My path lies undecided.
It's for the Gods to reveal.

22:28.000 --> 22:32.000
-But we can't...
-Go. Go.

22:52.000 --> 22:55.000
While serving under the standard
of my commanding officer,

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
General Aulus Plautius
of the four legions,

22:59.000 --> 23:02.000
I did see him engage in witchcraft
and religions of Britannia

23:02.000 --> 23:06.000
to the destruction of his mission,
his command, and Rome.

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
The first unclean act I saw

23:08.000 --> 23:11.000
was the general bury
a loyal legionary alive

23:11.000 --> 23:14.000
who had fallen prey to witchcraft.

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
I then witnessed him
secretly meet Druids.

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
And travel alone to their leaders.

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
I saw him receive potions
and spells from them.

23:22.000 --> 23:26.000
I was then ordered by his own Hand
to bring to him female children,

23:26.000 --> 23:29.000
whom he ordered my men to murder
in secret and bury in pits.

23:30.000 --> 23:33.000
I witnessed a ritual in which I saw
the general eat the heart

23:34.000 --> 23:37.000
of a murdered ally to Rome,
the Celt queen, Kerra..

23:37.000 --> 23:41.000
I witnessed his sexual affair
with the witch Amena Cantibrines

23:41.000 --> 23:44.000
with whom he lives as though man
and wife,

23:44.000 --> 23:47.000
and whom Aulus named
Queen Amena of the Cantii,

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
I believe under her spell.

23:50.000 --> 23:53.000
I am the survivor of a cohort,
ordered without authority

23:54.000 --> 23:55.000
into the untamed westlands,

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
as part of an action
led by the same witch,

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
resulting in our total annihilation.

24:00.000 --> 24:04.000
I have in my possession physical
evidence accompanying this testimony,

24:05.000 --> 24:09.000
of Druidry, symbols and spells found
in the general's own bedchamber.

24:09.000 --> 24:13.000
Including three severed fingers
of a known sorceress and enchantress,

24:13.000 --> 24:16.000
kept with one of the generals
own severed fingers.

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
Lastly...

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
I testify I heard the general boast

24:24.000 --> 24:28.000
he poisoned, drugged and pissed
on the emperor.

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
I, Tribune Vitus Aurelius

24:30.000 --> 24:33.000
of the 9th Legio Hispana,
do solemnly declare

24:33.000 --> 24:36.000
this is my true testimony
by the law of Rome,

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
I lay my life on any lie herein.

24:38.000 --> 24:42.000
Well, I mean, fucking hell.

24:43.000 --> 24:46.000
Make your mark here and seal.

24:46.000 --> 24:49.000
-When do I leave for Rome?
-Immediately.

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
You've done the right thing, Praefectus.

24:54.000 --> 24:58.000
Aulus Plautius, bad boy.

25:12.000 --> 25:15.000
-You took your time.
-Had some stuff to see to.

25:18.000 --> 25:21.000
-Aw, what happened to your eye?
-My baby scratched it.

25:23.000 --> 25:26.000
-You have a baby?
-I have lots of babies.

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
I just... Well, you don't, erm...

25:31.000 --> 25:35.000
-I see. Well.
-Well, I'm here. What do you want?

25:46.000 --> 25:49.000
-You take me to him.
-Him?

25:49.000 --> 25:52.000
You know who I mean. Name your price.

25:53.000 --> 25:58.000
Yeah, I know who. You know what?
This one's on me.

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
How've you been, Lucius?

26:05.000 --> 26:08.000
How is this hell hole treating you?

26:09.000 --> 26:12.000
It's been shit.
But I've had worse postings.

26:12.000 --> 26:15.000
-Magdala. Gerasa.
-Fucking hell.

26:16.000 --> 26:19.000
-Afada.
-Fucking Afada.

26:19.000 --> 26:22.000
Remember the silence
after we slaughtered every soul...

26:22.000 --> 26:25.000
-Enough.
-Babies, children, streets...

26:25.000 --> 26:28.000
-Black with blood.
-It was a battle.

26:28.000 --> 26:31.000
-A war.
-They weren't fighting, Lucius.

26:31.000 --> 26:35.000
No weapons. They were terrified of us.

26:35.000 --> 26:38.000
If you came all this way
to bring back nightmares,

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
you're wasting your time.

26:40.000 --> 26:43.000
-They never went away.
-No, old friend, that's not why I came.

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
I don't have nightmares. Not any more.

26:46.000 --> 26:47.000
Bullshit.
-It's true.

26:47.000 --> 26:50.000
I suffered for several years.

26:50.000 --> 26:54.000
-But then I was forgiven.
-What are you talking about?

26:56.000 --> 26:59.000
Did you ever feel, Lucius,
that you were in a story?

26:59.000 --> 27:04.000
I mean, did you ever pick up the knife,
only to discover that you were the knife

27:05.000 --> 27:09.000
and that someone or something else
was holding it

27:09.000 --> 27:14.000
like a sword maybe or a spear?

27:16.000 --> 27:21.000
Do you remember the man that we executed
on the hill of the skull? A Nazarene.

27:21.000 --> 27:24.000
He's why you're here
in the middle of nowhere,

27:24.000 --> 27:27.000
drowning your demons and yourself.

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
It was you who killed him.

27:34.000 --> 27:38.000
I'm growing tired of all this.
Good luck.

27:39.000 --> 27:42.000
If you can sleep at night,
all power to you.

27:42.000 --> 27:46.000
-You haven't asked me how I found you.
-I don't give a fuck.

27:47.000 --> 27:50.000
Except you do.

27:50.000 --> 27:53.000
I listened to you. Now you listen to me.

27:54.000 --> 27:57.000
I am not in some fucking story.

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
I go where I go.

28:00.000 --> 28:03.000
-You remember him, Lucius.
-I don't remember him.

28:03.000 --> 28:06.000
You remember him.

28:06.000 --> 28:09.000
You remember him.

28:18.000 --> 28:21.000
-Hi.
-He's sleeping.

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
Is he? Well, I'm not in a hurry.

28:24.000 --> 28:28.000
But if you could untie me,
that would be much appreciated.

28:33.000 --> 28:36.000
-You are?
-I'm nothing.

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
Oh, well, it's lovely to meet you.

28:41.000 --> 28:42.000
He's been expecting you.

28:49.000 --> 28:54.000
-How long will the sea voyage take?
-Two, maybe three weeks.

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
We must travel east to Clausentium.

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
From there, we'll take the road
to Noviomagus.

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
From there,
we'll board a ship to Rome.

29:11.000 --> 29:14.000
The winds this time of year are with us
and favor a passage south.

29:15.000 --> 29:18.000
I am eager to put this dark,
forsaken land behind me

29:18.000 --> 29:21.000
and see a bright and sunny world again.

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
-Where's the salt?
-What salt?

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
-You were riding to the coast.
-Right.

29:52.000 --> 29:55.000
-That was a lie.
-Why?

29:55.000 --> 29:58.000
You wouldn't let me go on the hunt,
so I went on one of my own.

29:58.000 --> 30:02.000
-Don't play games with me.
-I thought you liked games.

30:02.000 --> 30:03.000
Where have you been?

30:05.000 --> 30:08.000
-Give me a kiss and I'll tell you.
-Where have you been?

30:09.000 --> 30:12.000
I didn't ride the coast
because I found something on the way.

30:13.000 --> 30:16.000
-Something more valuable than salt.
-What?

30:19.000 --> 30:20.000
Veran.

30:24.000 --> 30:28.000
I remember what I did that day.
I remember what happened after.

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
And I've seen stranger things.

30:33.000 --> 30:37.000
You still have it, don't you?
The spear. You kept it.

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
You brought it with you, didn't you?

30:39.000 --> 30:45.000
-What the fuck does the spear matter?
-The spear has a power.

30:47.000 --> 30:51.000
I was ordered to find what you
kept safe. We know you have it.

30:51.000 --> 30:55.000
Whatever happened, I must put it with
the other weird shit I can't explain.

30:55.000 --> 31:00.000
You are part of the story, Lucius.
His story...

31:00.000 --> 31:04.000
No! I am part of my story, mate!

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
Only fucking just.

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
Where is it?

31:11.000 --> 31:15.000
You have come a long way, Josephus.

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
I hate to disappoint you.

31:20.000 --> 31:23.000
You have to listen to me, Lucius.

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
You are in turmoil.

31:25.000 --> 31:29.000
Whatever you believed or not believed,
has left you shipwrecked.

31:30.000 --> 31:33.000
There is only one way to the light.

31:33.000 --> 31:36.000
Do you want to find peace, Lucius?

31:37.000 --> 31:42.000
Then, accept him. Open your heart.

31:42.000 --> 31:45.000
Unless you are reborn,
you cannot see the light.

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
Reborn?

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
No, thanks.

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
What is born of the flesh is flesh.

31:55.000 --> 31:59.000
What is born of the spirit is spirit.

32:00.000 --> 32:04.000
As the body heals wounds,
so the spirit may be born again.

32:08.000 --> 32:12.000
Look, I appreciate the thought.
But if you knew what I'd been through,

32:12.000 --> 32:17.000
you'd know just how little appetite
I have for mumbo jumbo right now.

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
-He was also a fisherman...
-Was he?

32:19.000 --> 32:22.000
Bet he's a fucking clown.
I wouldn't wish it on a dog.

32:23.000 --> 32:28.000
If all I say is lies and make believe,
then explain to me one thing.

32:28.000 --> 32:31.000
Just one thing and I'll leave.

32:35.000 --> 32:38.000
-Why did you keep it?
-I don't have any fucking spear.

32:38.000 --> 32:41.000
Now, I need you to leave.

32:43.000 --> 32:47.000
-Open yourself, Lucius.
-Leave.

32:47.000 --> 32:50.000
Look, you need to atone.
The heavens are calling.

32:50.000 --> 32:53.000
Enough!

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
Josephus....

32:59.000 --> 33:01.000
Josephus, I'm sorry. I didn't mean...

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
You have the spear.

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
I don't understand, Josephus.

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
He forgives you.

33:22.000 --> 33:26.000
No. Josephus, no! No, no, no. No, no!

33:26.000 --> 33:29.000
No. No.

33:33.000 --> 33:38.000
Are you happy now, gods!
Are you happy?

33:51.000 --> 33:54.000
Finally. Thank you very much.

34:01.000 --> 34:06.000
-Apple?
-Thank you. Don't mind if I do.

34:08.000 --> 34:11.000
-So come on, how much?
-How much what?

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
How much did you pay her?

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
What's the going rate
for a Roman general?

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
Is that what you are?

34:21.000 --> 34:24.000
Go on, tell me. I'm dying to know.

34:24.000 --> 34:27.000
Hella works for me for free.

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
That's interesting.

34:33.000 --> 34:37.000
-So, how are you finding it? Britannia?
-Don't worry, it's growing on me.

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
-I missed it.
-Have you been away?

34:39.000 --> 34:42.000
Long time. We've met before.

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
Sorry, you're going to have to help me.

34:46.000 --> 34:49.000
In the Beneath. Few moons past.

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
That's strange.
I'm usually rather good with faces.

34:56.000 --> 35:00.000
There are parts of the Beneath
you can't go without my permission.

35:00.000 --> 35:03.000
We spoke briefly.
Not sure if you were listening.

35:03.000 --> 35:06.000
-That was terribly rude of me.
-Well, I've got your attention now.

35:09.000 --> 35:12.000
Looking at you now,
you do remind me of someone.

35:13.000 --> 35:15.000
You don't have a brother by any chance,
do you?

35:18.000 --> 35:21.000
I used to. A long time ago.

35:23.000 --> 35:27.000
-So, how can I help you?
-I thought you sent for me.

35:27.000 --> 35:31.000
-Come now, let's not be coy.
-Well, you weren't, were you?

35:31.000 --> 35:34.000
You killed my entire cohort.

35:34.000 --> 35:37.000
You were ignoring me,
even after I sent you a present.

35:37.000 --> 35:42.000
Oh, the witch! Yes, very helpful.
If a little costly.

35:43.000 --> 35:46.000
You couldn't tell me the thing I needed.

35:46.000 --> 35:47.000
And what was that?

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
Where's the Lake of Tears?

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
Join me.

36:06.000 --> 36:10.000
So how exactly
does the Lake of Tears concern you?

36:10.000 --> 36:13.000
Well, it doesn't especially.
Not in itself.

36:13.000 --> 36:16.000
Well, I'm looking for someone,
and they're headed there.

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
-Who told you that? The witch?
-Exactly.

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
Apparently, it's in some prophecy,

36:20.000 --> 36:24.000
I can't be doing with the buggers,
but, don't ask me how...

36:24.000 --> 36:27.000
This one has an uncanny knack
of always getting things right.

36:27.000 --> 36:31.000
-So, what's it say? The prophecy.
-Oh, most of it was lost on me.

36:31.000 --> 36:34.000
Two brothers. One betrayed the other.
Or did he?

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
Who cares? But then it gets good.

36:36.000 --> 36:41.000
A maiden. Daughter of a blind father.
A chosen one.

36:42.000 --> 36:46.000
-That caught my attention.
-So what would want with the maiden?

36:46.000 --> 36:51.000
-That's private. So, can you help me?
-What do I get?

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
You want the Druid. I want the maiden.

36:54.000 --> 36:59.000
I have your brother Conan.
Cut off, his whole world is God's.

37:00.000 --> 37:01.000
His death. His prophecy.

37:01.000 --> 37:05.000
The whole story,
it's about to come crashing down.

37:06.000 --> 37:10.000
So, your maiden's strong, wise.

37:10.000 --> 37:13.000
She's been out there a long time,
learnt things.

37:13.000 --> 37:16.000
Her powers grow with every passing day.

37:17.000 --> 37:21.000
To catch her is not like
catching a fly or a fish.

37:21.000 --> 37:25.000
It's like trying to catch smoke.
You have to be sly.

37:26.000 --> 37:27.000
Quick, like the wind.

37:29.000 --> 37:32.000
She's headed for the Lake of Tears.
Where is it?

37:32.000 --> 37:35.000
-Leave the girl to me.
-Where's the Lake of Tears?

37:35.000 --> 37:40.000
Leave the girl to me.
Unless that is, you don't trust me.

37:42.000 --> 37:47.000
You know, I do remember you now.
You told me life was about three things.

37:48.000 --> 37:49.000
What were they?

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
Number one, everything born will die.

37:54.000 --> 37:57.000
Number two...

37:59.000 --> 38:02.000
..everything you see,
everything you hear,

38:02.000 --> 38:06.000
everything you've ever learned,
everything around you, is a lie.

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
I said that?

38:09.000 --> 38:12.000
You did. And you know what?
I think you're bang on.

38:12.000 --> 38:16.000
The leaves, the trees,
the apples, everything.

38:17.000 --> 38:22.000
I'll let you into a secret.
This isn't the real world.

38:22.000 --> 38:23.000
The real world...

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
..is my master's garden.

38:27.000 --> 38:31.000
It's more perfect, more beautiful than
you or any Druids could ever imagine.

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
It's what it's all about.

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
Go on. What's the third thing?

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
The third thing you told me. Let me see.

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
The third thing...

39:06.000 --> 39:10.000
Forgive me. It's been so long
since I had good company.

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
You want to know where the lake is?

39:19.000 --> 39:22.000
-I do.
-You really want to know?

39:23.000 --> 39:26.000
All right, friend, Lake of Tears...

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
It's here.

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
Oh, thank you.
