- We've only got 24 hours.

03:49.455 --> 03:50.981
We never been here before.

03:51.081 --> 03:55.243

What do you think you're going to do?

and we haven't seen a thing.

06:42.071 --> 06:44.056
I got the rest of the day figured out.

06:44.156 --> 06:47.401
9:45, the New York City Hall.
10:00, the Cloisters.

06:47.535 --> 06:50.396
10:15, the Planetarium.
10:30, the Aquarium.

06:50.496 --> 06:52.239
10:45, the Natural...

06:52.581 --> 06:53.649
Hey, fellas!

06:53.749 --> 06:56.610
Hey, fellas! Aren't we gonna do
any more sightseeing?

06:56.710 --> 07:00.321
I never been any place but Peoria.
I wanna take in the beauties of New York.

07:00.421 --> 07:01.864
And I wanna take 'em out.

07:01.964 --> 07:05.534
Back where I come from
all the dames are covered with coal dust.

07:05.634 --> 07:08.545
Wow! Get a load of that!

07:09.013 --> 07:13.049
- Not bad.
- Not bad! Get him! "Mr. Particular!"

07:13.225 --> 07:15.377
Who you got waitin' for you?
Ava Gardner?

07:15.477 --> 07:19.297
Listen! I'm gonna take my time
till I find me a real New York glamour girl.

07:19.397 --> 07:21.049
I got a line that mows 'em down.

07:21.149 --> 07:23.843
Home in Meadowville, it lands me
the cream of the crop.

07:23.943 --> 07:26.846
Meadowville? You may be a big shot
in Meadowville...

07:26.946 --> 07:30.432
but don't forget the whole town could fit
in that manhole over there.

07:30.532 --> 07:32.184
Yeah? And so could you!

07:32.284 --> 07:33.268
- Yeah?
- Yeah!

07:33.368 --> 07:36.438
Hey, fellas! Break it up.
We're wasting the whole day.

07:36.538 --> 07:39.482
Why can't we pick up dates
and sightsee at the same time?

07:39.582 --> 07:43.236
See? Look, 10:30, the Aquarium.
Then 10:45...

07:43.336 --> 07:47.081
Sure, why not?
Ozzie, I got the whole day figured out.

07:47.256 --> 07:49.241
10:30, "Hello!"

07:49.341 --> 07:51.201
"Oh, hello!"

07:51.301 --> 07:52.244
10:45...

07:52.344 --> 07:53.670
Hold hands.

07:54.429 --> 07:55.288
11:00.

07:55.388 --> 07:56.881
"Shall we dance?"

08:00.184 --> 08:01.294
11:15.

08:01.394 --> 08:03.095
Our first kiss.

08:05.189 --> 08:06.424
11:30.

08:06.524 --> 08:07.883
Wow! Wow!

08:07.983 --> 08:10.227
Come on. Let's get the subway.

08:14.573 --> 08:16.766
Pardon me, sir, but how do I get uptown?

08:16.866 --> 08:19.444
Well, let's see. If you wanna go to...

08:24.874 --> 08:26.450
And there you are.

08:28.168 --> 08:30.446
I beg your pardon.
Is this the uptown platform?

08:30.546 --> 08:32.246
Now, it all depends.

08:37.385 --> 08:38.453
Get that?

08:38.553 --> 08:40.004
Yeah, thanks.

08:40.638 --> 08:41.964
Come on.

08:52.608 --> 08:53.717
Then what'd he say?

08:53.817 --> 08:57.512
So I said, "Listen, Mr. Gadolphin,
I won't work overtime, no matter what...

08:57.612 --> 09:00.473
"...whether it's handling
the bookkeeping accounts or you."

09:00.573 --> 09:01.516
What'd he say?

09:01.616 --> 09:05.353
So I said, "Listen, Mr. Gadolphin,
you make just one more pass at me...

09:05.453 --> 09:09.231
"...and yours truly is passing right out
from the Grand Illusion Girdle Company."

09:09.331 --> 09:11.992
- And what did he say?
- So I said...

09:14.711 --> 09:16.621
Hey! One side, fellows.

09:18.423 --> 09:21.667
- Say, what're you doin'?
- Puttin' up a little artwork.

09:21.801 --> 09:24.587
There. Miss Turnstiles
for the month of June.

09:24.887 --> 09:26.288
"Meet lovely Ivy Smith."

09:26.388 --> 09:29.291
- Gee, a real New York glamour girl.
- A debutante, I'll bet.

09:29.391 --> 09:31.877
- She must be pretty important.
- I wouldn't say that.

09:31.977 --> 09:33.962
Her picture's up all over the subway.

09:34.062 --> 09:37.807
Well, like it says, they pick
a new Miss Turnstiles every month.

09:37.982 --> 09:39.384
Excuse me.

09:39.484 --> 09:41.636
Look, "She's a home-loving girl...

09:41.736 --> 09:44.096
"...but she loves high society's whirl."

09:44.196 --> 09:47.725
"She loves the Army,
but her heart belongs to the Navy."

09:47.825 --> 09:51.945
"She is studying painting at the museums
and dancing at Symphonic Hall."

09:53.663 --> 09:55.782
Gee, she's wonderful!

09:56.249 --> 09:57.525
A celebrity.

09:57.625 --> 10:00.244
Yeah, what a girl!

10:00.962 --> 10:02.238
She can do everything.

10:02.338 --> 10:06.000
Look what it says:
"Meet lovely Ivy Smith.

10:06.717 --> 10:10.120
<i>"Every month some lucky little
New York miss is chosen...</i>

10:10.220 --> 10:13.248
<i>"...from the thousands of girls
who ride the subways...</i>

10:13.348 --> 10:15.633
<i>"...to be Miss Turnstiles.</i>

10:15.767 --> 10:20.721
<i>"She's got to be brilliant,
beautiful, talented.</i>

10:21.898 --> 10:24.016
<i>"Just an average girl.</i>

10:24.400 --> 10:28.312
<i>"This month, the fortunate lassie is
Miss Ivy Smith."</i>

10:28.612 --> 10:29.847
Who? Me?

10:29.947 --> 10:31.314
<i>Yes, you.</i>

10:40.123 --> 10:43.534
<i>Though a celebrity,
Miss Smith is a home-loving girl.</i>

11:00.058 --> 11:03.260
<i>But she loves high society's whirl.</i>

11:20.535 --> 11:22.612
<i>She goes out for the Army...</i>

11:24.997 --> 11:27.783
<i>but her heart belongs to the Navy.</i>

11:30.961 --> 11:34.539
<i>She studies painting and dancing
at Symphonic Hall.</i>

11:48.852 --> 11:51.680
<i>She's a frail, flower-like creature.</i>

11:52.981 --> 11:55.225
<i>But oh, boy! What an athlete!</i>

13:50.380 --> 13:51.698
Gee, what a girl!

13:51.798 --> 13:53.450
- Hey, cut that out.
- Gabe!

13:53.550 --> 13:55.710
Come on. Let's get out of here.

13:56.678 --> 13:58.755
Hey, put that back, you guys.

14:00.098 --> 14:01.165
Why'd you do that?

14:01.265 --> 14:03.376
I like her. I want it for my collection.

14:03.476 --> 14:05.544
That's all you'll have of her.

14:05.644 --> 14:07.296
Who knows? Maybe I'll meet her.

14:07.396 --> 14:09.923
There are over four million women
in New York City.

14:10.023 --> 14:14.352
It'll take you a million years to find her.
Why, the law of averages says...

14:14.903 --> 14:17.430
Miss Smith, act like you're putting
a coin in a box.

14:17.530 --> 14:19.724
Out of the way.
We're takin' a picture here.

14:19.824 --> 14:23.019
Why don't we get one of these sailors
in the picture? Stand here.

14:23.119 --> 14:26.480
Miss Smith, give him the dime.
You put the fare in the box for her.

14:26.580 --> 14:29.408
Hey, you're...
Aren't you Miss Turnstiles?

14:30.167 --> 14:33.111
- How did you know?
- I saw your picture in the subway and...

14:33.211 --> 14:35.781
- You mean you saw my picture at...
- Yeah.

14:35.881 --> 14:37.123
Oh, that.

14:37.716 --> 14:40.910
I'm terribly flattered you liked it
well enough to take it with you.

14:41.010 --> 14:42.370
- How's that, Max?
- Fine.

14:42.470 --> 14:45.039
Drop the dime in the box, Sailor.
Hold it.

14:45.139 --> 14:48.459
That's all, Miss Smith. Thanks, Sailor.
We're proud of our boys.

14:48.559 --> 14:51.303
Thanks. I'm terribly late now.
I'll have to run.

14:51.478 --> 14:53.964
Goodbye, Sailor.
Thanks for posing with me.

14:54.064 --> 14:55.473
Hey, wait!

15:01.237 --> 15:03.389
- We'll head her off at the next station.
- What?

15:03.489 --> 15:04.473
In a cab.

15:04.573 --> 15:06.684
Why do you always
have to run after girls?

15:06.784 --> 15:09.695
I'll tell you when your voice changes,
Junior.

15:11.038 --> 15:12.614
Hey, Oz, come on.

15:13.915 --> 15:14.900
Taxi. Taxi.

15:15.000 --> 15:18.153
Sorry. No more fares today.
I'm turning in the cab. It's overdue.

15:18.253 --> 15:19.746
Please, mister.

15:20.588 --> 15:22.532
Hey! He's a girl!

15:22.632 --> 15:24.992
What're you doing driving a cab?
The war's over.

15:25.092 --> 15:27.961
I never give up anything I like. Get in.

15:29.138 --> 15:32.541
- The subway station.
- It's right there. You too weak to walk it?

15:32.641 --> 15:34.042
No, the next one, uptown.

15:34.142 --> 15:37.095
All right, but only if he gets up front.

15:37.979 --> 15:39.631
All right, Chip. Get up there.

15:39.731 --> 15:40.840
- Get in there.
- No.

15:40.940 --> 15:42.892
Come on. Get going.

15:51.491 --> 15:53.727
- What's wrong with you?
- What's got into you?

15:53.827 --> 15:58.690
I met her. I ran right into her. You said
it couldn't happen and I ran into her.

15:58.790 --> 16:01.609
What became of the line of jive
that "mows 'em down"?

16:01.709 --> 16:04.904
I didn't have a chance. Just watch me
when we catch up with her.

16:05.004 --> 16:06.530
Lady, faster, please.

16:06.630 --> 16:08.073
Yeah, come on, lady.

16:08.173 --> 16:11.001
For you, anything. What's your name?

16:11.718 --> 16:12.919
Chip.

16:13.178 --> 16:15.622
Chip, huh? Bet you can't guess mine.

16:15.722 --> 16:18.333
There are over two million
girl's names registered...

16:18.433 --> 16:22.295
All right, you win. It's Esterhazy.
Brunhilde Esterhazy.

16:22.395 --> 16:23.588
Pleased to meet you.

16:23.688 --> 16:25.798
- Why don't you come up to my place?
- What?

16:25.898 --> 16:28.425
Look, Chip, I've been waitin' for you
all my life.

16:28.525 --> 16:31.095
I knew you the minute I saw you.
You're for me.

16:31.195 --> 16:35.348
I like your face, it's open,
you know what I mean? Nothin' in it.

16:35.448 --> 16:37.901
The kind of a face I could fall into.

16:38.660 --> 16:40.645
- Kiss me.
- Please, Miss Esterhazy.

16:40.745 --> 16:44.482
Just call me Hildy. Why don't you ditch
these guys and come up to my place?

16:44.582 --> 16:47.443
Lady, I hardly know you.
I've only got one day in town.

16:47.543 --> 16:51.447
- I want to see all the famous landmarks.
- Stick with me, kid, I'll show you plenty.

16:51.547 --> 16:53.123
Hey, here it is.

16:53.298 --> 16:55.375
Oh, yeah, Columbus Circle.

17:14.108 --> 17:18.680
- Hey, Esterhazy, what're you doin' here?
- Hello, Spud. What's on your tiny mind?

17:18.780 --> 17:21.473
Don't sweet-talk me.
This cab is due back in the garage.

17:21.574 --> 17:24.727
Bixby's waitin' to take it out.
Get in there or I'll report you.

17:24.827 --> 17:26.194
Okay. Okay.

17:29.915 --> 17:31.692
We must have just missed the train.

17:31.792 --> 17:33.485
Taxi. Taxi. Taxi.

17:33.585 --> 17:36.530
I'll bet we'll find dozens of glamour girls
at Grant's Tomb.

17:36.630 --> 17:38.073
- Sure.
- Taxi, anyone?

17:38.173 --> 17:41.034
You don't wanna waste your whole day
lookin' for one girl.

17:41.134 --> 17:42.368
Taxi. Taxi.

17:42.468 --> 17:44.871
And besides, Gabe,
you always got the picture.

17:44.971 --> 17:47.798
When we get aboard ship,
you can hang it up in a locker.

17:48.390 --> 17:51.794
The picture! Look, fellows,
it's full of clues.

17:51.894 --> 17:54.504
- If I follow them, I'm sure to find her.
- What?

17:54.604 --> 17:58.174
She has to be at one of these places.
We can track her down easy.

17:58.274 --> 18:00.685
Gabe, what's happened to you?

18:00.985 --> 18:04.647
I don't know. All I know is
I gotta find this girl.

18:04.780 --> 18:06.857
Get your red hot taxis here.

18:07.324 --> 18:09.935
Wait a minute, fellows.
I don't want to spoil your day.

18:10.035 --> 18:12.563
- You guys go ahead.
- What's it say on the card?

18:12.663 --> 18:15.816
If we do this systematically,
we can find her in a couple of hours.

18:15.916 --> 18:18.109
It says she's studying painting
in the museums...

18:18.209 --> 18:19.410
Museums?

18:19.961 --> 18:21.404
Come on. Let's try it.

18:21.504 --> 18:22.572
Well?

18:22.672 --> 18:24.073
Here I am.

18:24.173 --> 18:27.410
- Where's the nearest museum?
- Museum of Anthropological History.

18:27.510 --> 18:29.169
Okay, let's go.

18:29.428 --> 18:31.546
Only if he gets up front.

18:32.389 --> 18:34.090
What's the big idea?

18:35.934 --> 18:38.636
I knew you'd come back.
They all come back.

18:43.983 --> 18:45.259
How much do we owe you?

18:45.359 --> 18:48.979
Never mind. Let's run it up a little.
I'm coming in with you.

18:51.573 --> 18:55.435
This unique skeleton is the result
of 20 years unceasing labor.

18:55.535 --> 18:58.521
This dinosaur roamed the earth
six million years ago.

18:58.621 --> 19:00.281
Let us move on.

19:02.583 --> 19:03.826
Excuse me.

19:15.095 --> 19:17.706
Don't be frightened, lady.
They're all dead.

19:17.806 --> 19:22.468
Hold it. It's fantastic. I've simply got
to get the two of you together.

19:22.727 --> 19:25.346
Oh, my dear, you are priceless.

19:27.106 --> 19:29.766
Thank you. How about some cheesecake?

19:29.900 --> 19:32.719
What a lucky girl I am.
I've got to get your measurements.

19:32.819 --> 19:35.647
I'm a Junior Miss, size 11,
very high-waisted.

19:36.281 --> 19:37.515
Gorgeous.

19:37.615 --> 19:39.484
Now, it's my turn.

19:44.997 --> 19:46.899
Stop! How dare you!

19:46.999 --> 19:48.826
I was only playin', lady.

19:49.626 --> 19:51.070
What are you doin' tonight?

19:51.170 --> 19:55.907
Now, just a minute. I want you to know
that my interest in you is purely scientific.

19:56.007 --> 19:57.826
I'm just a cold-blooded scientist...

19:57.926 --> 20:00.745
and I'm writing an anthropological study
for this museum.

20:00.845 --> 20:04.048
<i>It's called Modern Man - What Is It?</i>

20:04.348 --> 20:07.001
- The name is Claire Huddesen.
- Pleased to meet you.

20:07.101 --> 20:09.795
I took your picture just now
because you look exactly...

20:09.895 --> 20:14.341
<i>like this Pithecanthropus erectus,
a man extinct since 6,000,000 B.C.</i>

20:14.441 --> 20:16.059
I look like that?

20:19.112 --> 20:20.430
I look like that.

20:20.530 --> 20:23.891
Now, don't be moody.
You made an understandable mistake.

20:23.991 --> 20:25.601
And now the head.

20:25.701 --> 20:28.654
That subsuperdolichocephalic head!

20:28.829 --> 20:31.231
Sailor, I love you for having that.

20:31.331 --> 20:34.568
All my life I wanted someone
to love me for my sakidophalic head.

20:34.668 --> 20:35.735
Don't be bitter.

20:35.835 --> 20:39.989
There aren't many of us left. We had
a sakidophalic class reunion last year.

20:40.089 --> 20:42.492
Not many of the old faces
around anymore.

20:42.592 --> 20:45.502
Well, that'll be all. You can go now.

20:47.221 --> 20:51.125
How come a girl like you is interested
in this anthropo... whatchamacallit?

20:51.225 --> 20:52.709
You see, it's this way.

20:52.809 --> 20:55.921
I've been running around too much
with all kinds of young men.

20:56.021 --> 20:57.756
I just couldn't settle down...

20:57.856 --> 21:00.758
so my guardian suggested
I take up anthropology.

21:00.858 --> 21:05.263
He thought if I made a scientific study
of man, I'd become more objective...

21:05.363 --> 21:09.191
get them out of my system,
be able to control myself.

21:09.450 --> 21:12.402
- Has it worked?
- Almost completely.

21:19.000 --> 21:22.153
I was just asking if she knew
where I could find Miss Turnstiles.

21:22.253 --> 21:23.488
- Sure.
- Of course.

21:23.588 --> 21:25.781
And I was just doing a bit of research.

21:25.881 --> 21:27.491
Dr. Kinsey, I presume.

21:27.591 --> 21:29.743
Really, I was just
telling your friend...

21:29.843 --> 21:30.577
Ozzie.

21:30.677 --> 21:33.497
Ozzie, what a remarkable specimen he is.

21:33.597 --> 21:36.799
<i>An exact throwback
to the Pithecanthropus erectus.</i>

21:39.394 --> 21:42.138
Hey, look. She's gonna put me in a book.

21:42.688 --> 21:44.674
- Holy smoke!
- How about that?

21:44.774 --> 21:47.343
Yes, you see, there are all too few
modern males...

21:47.443 --> 21:50.054
who can measure up to the prehistoric.

21:50.154 --> 21:52.347
"Modern man is not for me

21:52.447 --> 21:54.816
"The movie star and Dapper Dan

21:55.075 --> 21:58.019
"Give me the healthy Joe from ages ago

21:58.119 --> 22:00.154

22:06.001 --> 22:08.946
"I want a happy ape
with no English drape

22:09.046 --> 22:11.289
"A prehistoric man

22:12.215 --> 22:14.584
"Top hats, bow ties

22:14.968 --> 22:17.045
"He simply wore no ties

22:17.554 --> 22:19.756
"Bearskin, bearskin

22:20.348 --> 22:23.592
"He just sat around
in nothin' but bearskin

22:24.185 --> 22:26.095
"I really love bearskin

22:28.063 --> 22:30.090
"Some guys care a lot for me

22:30.190 --> 22:32.801
"But my excitement they can't fan

22:32.901 --> 22:35.929
"Because I still await my primitive mate

22:36.029 --> 22:40.108
"We've had a date
Since the world began

"My prehistoric man

22:45.579 --> 22:47.614
"No psychoanalysis

22:47.873 --> 22:50.158
"He never knew what made him tick

22:50.542 --> 22:53.528
"He never paid, it seems,
for telling his dreams

22:53.628 --> 22:55.538
"Poor prehistoric Dick

22:56.631 --> 22:58.625
"Jitters, jitters

22:59.259 --> 23:01.377
"He never had jitters

23:01.928 --> 23:03.754
"No repression

23:04.555 --> 23:07.925
"He just believed
in free self-expression

23:08.350 --> 23:10.510
"I love self-expression

23:12.104 --> 23:14.214
"He had honest calluses

23:14.314 --> 23:16.599
"He never worked to pile up dough

23:16.900 --> 23:19.886
"So unlike you and me
No ulcers had he

"Simple and free in the long ago

"I really love tom-toms"

23:57.562 --> 23:59.138
Tom-tom!

24:50.027 --> 24:51.353
That's good!

26:18.983 --> 26:20.309
Watch out!

26:23.821 --> 26:26.523
We'd better get out of here. Come on.

26:26.657 --> 26:27.816
Come on.

26:41.170 --> 26:42.997
Come on, let's go!

26:48.010 --> 26:50.120
<i>- Calling car 44.
- That's us.</i>

26:50.220 --> 26:52.456
<i>Report to Museum of
Anthropological History.</i>

26:52.556 --> 26:54.666
<i>Investigate collapse of dinosaur.</i>

26:54.766 --> 26:57.552
- Collapse? Why, that's terrible.
- Why?

26:57.685 --> 27:00.930
She's my favorite singing star,
that Dinah Shore.

27:05.359 --> 27:07.761
The professor at the museum
seemed miffed.

27:07.861 --> 27:10.264
How'd you feel if someone broke
your dinosaur?

27:10.364 --> 27:13.066
I never had one, we were too poor.

27:14.701 --> 27:17.395
Well, can I drop
the three of you someplace?

27:17.495 --> 27:19.939
No. We're all helping Gabey
find Miss Turnstiles.

27:20.039 --> 27:21.733
Let's try all the other museums.

27:21.833 --> 27:24.777
We're stickin' with you, Gabe.
We don't give up that easy.

27:24.877 --> 27:26.745
Well, neither do I.

27:41.601 --> 27:43.177
<i>Toujours l'amour.</i>

28:00.618 --> 28:04.021
At least I'm catching up on my culture.
Where do we go from here?

28:04.121 --> 28:06.690
She might be at
the Symphonic Hall Building.

28:06.790 --> 28:08.567
- Symphonic Hall?
- Yeah.

28:08.667 --> 28:11.028
Wait a second.
I want to get something straight.

28:11.128 --> 28:13.405
You're all going to the Symphonic Hall?

28:13.505 --> 28:14.156
Yeah.

28:14.256 --> 28:16.408
If she isn't there,
you'll go someplace else?

28:16.508 --> 28:17.158
Sure.

28:17.258 --> 28:19.035
- And then someplace else?
- Yeah.

28:19.135 --> 28:22.922
And you guys have to be back on the ship
at 6:00 tomorrow morning?

28:23.556 --> 28:26.842
Well, it seems to me if we split up,
we'd get farther.

28:27.059 --> 28:30.921
I mean, we'd get farther looking for her.
We'd keep looking but we'd look...

28:31.021 --> 28:34.091
in three different places
instead of the same place.

28:34.191 --> 28:39.145
Yeah. Maybe Hildy and I could go to
the subway people for some information.

28:39.696 --> 28:42.932
That's a splendid idea. Ozzie and I,
we could look Miss Smith up...

28:43.032 --> 28:45.601
in the social register.
I have a copy at home.

28:45.701 --> 28:48.270
Yeah. Yeah. That sounds practical.

28:48.370 --> 28:49.772
Yeah. Very practical.

28:49.872 --> 28:53.775
- We hate to leave you alone.
- I know you do. It's breakin' your heart.

28:53.875 --> 28:56.278
- Shall we go?
- Come along, specimen.

28:56.378 --> 28:59.447
- Well, we'll all meet at 8:30, huh?
- Okay. Where?

28:59.547 --> 29:01.741
On top of the Empire State Building?

29:01.841 --> 29:03.034
All right. 8:30.

29:03.134 --> 29:05.461
We'll see what we
can get done till then.

29:06.720 --> 29:08.881
Well, so long.

29:09.348 --> 29:10.757
Good hunting.

29:12.434 --> 29:14.052
Which way do we go?

29:14.394 --> 29:16.471
The way of all flesh, Junior.

29:17.105 --> 29:19.223
The way of all flesh.

29:21.776 --> 29:25.388
- I guess we pulled that off.
- Yeah. I'm glad we're alone.

29:25.488 --> 29:28.057
Well, I'm glad you're glad.
It's about time.

29:28.157 --> 29:29.900
Where'll we go first?

29:30.242 --> 29:33.937
Now that we're alone, you can take me
on that sightseeing tour of the city.

29:34.037 --> 29:36.364
I was afraid you'd remember that.

29:36.623 --> 29:38.900
A quick tour of the city,
then up to my place.

29:39.000 --> 29:41.486
No. Then we gotta go looking
for Gabey's girl.

29:41.586 --> 29:43.871
No! Then up to my place.

29:44.380 --> 29:46.165
Where do you want to go first?

29:47.132 --> 29:48.701
"My grandpa told me, 'Chip, my boy

29:48.801 --> 29:50.411

"'lf you should ever hit New York

29:53.680 --> 29:56.499
- The Hippodrome?
- Yeah, the Hippodrome.

29:56.599 --> 29:59.627
"Did I hear right?
Did you say the Hippodrome?

29:59.727 --> 30:02.847
"Yes, you heard right.
Yes, I said the...

"It ain't there anymore

30:09.445 --> 30:13.849
"They tore it down, you know,
a dozen years ago"

30:13.949 --> 30:16.351
I wanted to see the Hippodrome.

30:16.451 --> 30:18.770
What year is that guidebook anyway?

30:18.870 --> 30:19.854
1905.

30:19.954 --> 30:22.023
1905! No wonder!

30:22.123 --> 30:25.526
Don't you realize a big city like this
changes all the time?

30:25.626 --> 30:27.862
But there's one thing
that doesn't change.

30:27.962 --> 30:29.613
Come up to my place.

30:29.713 --> 30:30.872
No.

30:33.508 --> 30:36.620

and told me of one special pearl

you can see the backyard.

32:15.560 --> 32:17.337
Make yourself at home.

to really try to find Miss Turnstiles.

32:21.524 --> 32:23.768
Look, Chip, we tried before.

32:23.943 --> 32:26.145
- Yeah, we did try.
- Sure.

32:26.320 --> 32:30.649
- And we'll try again later.
- Sure, much later. Let's try this first.

32:31.408 --> 32:33.818
Well, as long as we tried...

32:39.290 --> 32:40.191
Lucy!

32:40.291 --> 32:42.326
What on earth are you doing here?

32:42.502 --> 32:45.279
I'm sorry, Hildy. I just couldn't go
to work today.

32:45.379 --> 32:47.948
I've got an awful cold
and I didn't know you...

32:48.048 --> 32:49.908
Of all the days you picked.

32:50.008 --> 32:53.745
Chip, this is my roommate, Lucy Shmeeler.
She's a grand girl.

32:53.845 --> 32:56.047
- How do you do?
- Hello, Chip.

32:56.306 --> 33:00.718
I'm sorry. I've got to inhale.
Excuse me.

33:04.021 --> 33:08.308
- Think she'll stay under there long?
- Sure. She'll be under there for days.

33:10.527 --> 33:13.021
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

33:13.864 --> 33:16.850
You know, Hildy, this is just like
taking a picture.

33:16.950 --> 33:20.486
If I had a camera, I could get
the two of you together.

33:21.871 --> 33:24.532
You could do that
by just leaving the room.

33:32.798 --> 33:34.040
Come here.

33:39.637 --> 33:41.881
- Is that you, Chip?
- No.

33:45.684 --> 33:47.719
I've got to get some gargle.

33:50.189 --> 33:51.507
I got the gargle.

33:51.607 --> 33:53.892
Well, I'm very glad to hear that.

33:54.776 --> 33:55.977
Lucy!

33:56.444 --> 33:59.013
Would you mind stepping
into the other room?

33:59.113 --> 34:01.974
- What for?
- I'd like to go over some figures with you.

34:02.074 --> 34:04.310
- Figures?
- The rent, Lucy. The rent.

34:04.410 --> 34:05.945
Hildy, we paid...

34:13.126 --> 34:14.735
I'm going out.

34:14.835 --> 34:16.454
With that cold?

34:16.670 --> 34:19.699
I'm going to an air-cooled movie.
Hildy says...

34:19.799 --> 34:22.577
- It'll do you a world of good, Lucy.
- Yes, it will. Yes.

34:22.677 --> 34:24.829
Thanks. I'll do the same
for you someday.

34:24.929 --> 34:27.373
When will you ever get the opportunity?

34:27.473 --> 34:30.132
- Goodbye, Miss Shmeeler.
- Goodbye, Mr. Chips.

34:43.029 --> 34:46.774
"Hark! Ah, the nightingale.
The tawny..."

34:49.993 --> 34:53.196
But I don't wanna be
like Margaret O'Brien.

34:53.371 --> 34:56.658
Now, be quiet.
Just wait till I get you home.

34:57.959 --> 35:02.788
<i>- Are you auditioning for Grab Your Spats?
- No, I'm only interested in classic ballet.</i>

35:19.646 --> 35:20.805
Plié!

35:21.147 --> 35:24.517
But, Madame, my parents in Meadowville
are so proud of me.

35:24.900 --> 35:27.219
They're so thrilled
that I'm Miss Turnstiles.

35:27.319 --> 35:28.896
Second position.

35:29.321 --> 35:31.765
I know that being Miss Turnstiles
means nothing...

35:31.865 --> 35:34.518
but they think it makes me
an important person.

35:34.618 --> 35:39.272
Gee, it'd be just terrible if they found out
I'm working as a kootch dancer.

35:39.372 --> 35:43.951
Third position. Me, I will not breathe
a word on them about this...

35:44.251 --> 35:47.413
unless I must write them about payments.

35:48.005 --> 35:50.157
- Madame Dilyovska.
- Fourth position.

35:50.257 --> 35:52.326
Remember, you're a fortunate girl.

35:52.426 --> 35:55.745
You study with great Dilyovska
who has taught everyone...

35:55.845 --> 35:59.298
from Nijinsky to Mickey Rooney.
Fifth position.

35:59.807 --> 36:01.717
I will make you big star.

36:02.310 --> 36:05.179
I am best teacher
this side of the world.

36:05.646 --> 36:09.850
And now, my special exercise
for the balance:

36:10.150 --> 36:12.060
The upside-down frappé.

36:12.235 --> 36:14.646
One, two, three, four.

36:14.946 --> 36:17.390
One, two, three, four.

36:17.490 --> 36:19.150
Good. Good.

36:22.829 --> 36:24.071
Very good.

36:30.043 --> 36:33.246
Pardon me, my dear.
I will be gone only short while.

36:33.839 --> 36:35.365
Keep practicing.

36:35.465 --> 36:36.791
Practicing.

36:38.134 --> 36:39.502
Yes, Madame.

36:43.806 --> 36:46.383
Clumsy mariner, look where you're going.

36:53.565 --> 36:54.724
Hey!

36:56.026 --> 36:59.137
- A gentleman should always knock.
- It's you, Ivy Smith.

36:59.237 --> 37:00.263
And what if I am?

37:00.363 --> 37:02.598
I knew I'd find you!
Don't you remember me?

37:02.698 --> 37:04.725
I'm afraid we haven't had the pleasure.

37:04.825 --> 37:07.736
I'm the sailor who posed with you
in the subway.

37:08.037 --> 37:10.072
Oh, of course.

37:10.706 --> 37:13.984
I dimly recall,
one meets so many people.

37:14.084 --> 37:16.536
Yeah. Yeah, I bet you do.

37:17.003 --> 37:19.705
Well, if you'll excuse me, I'm busy.

37:20.173 --> 37:23.618
Listen, Ivy, you know, it was funny,
me bumping into you like this.

37:23.718 --> 37:26.954
I just happened to be passing
Symphonic Hall, and I said to myself:

37:27.054 --> 37:29.123
"Gabe, my boy," that's my name, Gabey...

37:29.223 --> 37:31.834
"...why don't you drop in,
have a look-see at the girls?"

37:31.934 --> 37:35.587
I had an hour to kill, so I thought
I'd give some lucky little chick a break.

37:35.687 --> 37:37.922
If you play your cards right,
it could be you.

37:38.022 --> 37:40.008
What are you driving at?

37:40.108 --> 37:42.969
I'm a pretty special guy
and you're a pretty special girl...

37:43.069 --> 37:45.930
so why don't you and me
do some fancy steppin' tonight?

37:46.030 --> 37:50.142
Take in the swank spots. You know,
El Morocco, Stork Club, Roseland...

37:50.242 --> 37:51.477
How about it?

37:51.577 --> 37:53.729
Of all the uncouth nerve.

37:53.829 --> 37:56.898
- Leave at once, you sailor...
- Miss Smith, don't get excited...

37:56.998 --> 38:00.610
Of all the insulting lines. Do you think
I'd go out with any old sailor...

38:00.710 --> 38:04.197
I've never even seen before?
Please, leave at once! I'm very busy!

38:04.297 --> 38:07.249
I have a singing lesson upstairs,
and I've got to change.

38:10.719 --> 38:12.796
Okay, sister, it's your loss.

38:21.229 --> 38:24.390
Look, I want to apologize
for everything I just said.

38:24.899 --> 38:27.843
I thought I'd pull that fancy line on you
but it didn't work.

38:27.943 --> 38:31.354
I didn't just drop in here accidentally.

38:31.697 --> 38:35.025
I've been looking for you all day,
ever since I met you.

38:35.992 --> 38:36.810
Really?

38:36.910 --> 38:40.563
Yeah. And then finding you like this,
I guess I lost my head.

38:40.663 --> 38:42.607
I threw that big-shot stuff at you...

38:42.707 --> 38:46.527
because I thought it was the only way
I could impress a big celebrity like you.

38:46.627 --> 38:51.164
You probably got millionaires,
society guys running after you all the time.

38:51.673 --> 38:53.375
Oh, yes.

38:54.468 --> 38:55.919
By the droves.

38:56.344 --> 39:01.257
Yeah. Well, I'm sorry I bothered you.
I guess I'm a little out of my depth.

39:01.599 --> 39:05.511
Us small-town guys must sound silly
to a native New Yorker like you.

39:05.978 --> 39:06.879
Oh, yes.

39:06.979 --> 39:09.048
When one is a native New Yorker...

39:09.148 --> 39:12.467
small town seem so provincial.

39:12.567 --> 39:16.813
Back home in Meadowville, Indiana,
we don't get to meet girls like you.

39:16.946 --> 39:18.223
Meadowville?

39:18.323 --> 39:21.192
- Yeah, did you ever hear of it?
- Oh, no.

39:21.409 --> 39:23.603
I probably learned about it
in geography.

39:23.703 --> 39:26.230
I doubt that,
the population's only 18,000.

39:26.330 --> 39:28.282
That's not so small.

39:29.875 --> 39:33.111
- They're all people, just like anyone else.
- That's right.

39:33.211 --> 39:34.946
I think a small town's all right.

39:35.046 --> 39:38.408
It's nobody's fault if they're from there.
They're usually born there.

39:38.508 --> 39:41.286
We big-city folk must never forget
that "the small towns...

39:41.386 --> 39:43.871
"...are the backbones
of the American civilization."

39:43.971 --> 39:47.374
That's just the phrase Miss Hodges used
in my American history class.

39:47.474 --> 39:49.376
Did you have Miss Hodges?

39:49.476 --> 39:53.513
I mean, Miss Hodges
is such a funny name.

39:53.688 --> 39:54.848
Yeah.

39:58.735 --> 40:01.938
Well, tell me more about this place,
Meadowville.

40:02.905 --> 40:05.774
- You really want to hear about it?
- Yes.

40:07.910 --> 40:11.613
"There's not much to tell
about my hometown

40:13.040 --> 40:17.202
"Life is easy and the tempo slow

40:18.628 --> 40:22.623
"But if you really want to find
what's in it

40:23.257 --> 40:25.918
"You'll learn in a minute

40:26.260 --> 40:29.379
"All you have to know

40:30.430 --> 40:31.965
"Let's go

40:33.934 --> 40:35.969
"Come walkin' with me

40:36.436 --> 40:40.806
"I want you to see our Main Street

40:43.234 --> 40:45.469
"You'll know the whole town

40:45.569 --> 40:49.690
"By just walkin down our Main Street

40:52.326 --> 40:56.521
"There's the corner
where the boys hang out

40:56.621 --> 41:00.158
"As each girl goes by they rate her

41:01.167 --> 41:05.496
"Whistle and try to date her, later

41:06.130 --> 41:09.333
"Baby, are you goin' steady?

41:09.800 --> 41:13.537
"And then we can stop
and chat with the cop

41:13.637 --> 41:16.422
"On Main Street

41:18.683 --> 41:23.763
"He made an arrest way back in 1903

41:26.941 --> 41:31.512
"He'll ask me,
'Who is the pretty stranger? '

41:31.612 --> 41:35.273
"How proud I'm gonna be

41:36.241 --> 41:41.404
"When you walk down Main Street with me

43:32.723 --> 43:36.793
"How proud I'm gonna be

43:36.893 --> 43:41.931
"When you walk down Main Street...

43:42.356 --> 43:45.017
"...with me"

43:50.364 --> 43:51.690
Gosh, Ivy...

43:51.865 --> 43:53.400
I mean, Miss Smith...

43:53.700 --> 43:56.819
Do you think that...
Would you go out with me tonight?

43:57.287 --> 44:01.532
Oh, no. I'm afraid a date is quite
out of the question. I'm busy.

44:01.666 --> 44:03.442
One of your rich boyfriends?

44:03.542 --> 44:05.911
Yes, one of them, or other.

44:06.670 --> 44:09.239
But how long
are you going to be in town?

44:09.339 --> 44:12.751
Just today. I gotta be back on the ship
tomorrow morning.

44:14.594 --> 44:17.122
Gabey, I'd love to go out
with you tonight.

44:17.222 --> 44:18.289
What?

44:18.389 --> 44:21.751
I have a big society party to go to
but I'll break the engagement.

44:21.851 --> 44:23.544
- You will?
- Yes.

44:23.644 --> 44:27.006
- Shall I come and get you?
- Oh, no. I'll meet you.

44:27.106 --> 44:29.349
- Good. 8:30?
- 8:30.

44:30.150 --> 44:31.643
What is here going on?

44:33.153 --> 44:35.889
- Is this a friend of yours?
- Well, not exactly...

44:35.989 --> 44:37.899
Leave at once, young man.

44:39.701 --> 44:41.944
Well, goodbye. About 8:30.

44:42.245 --> 44:43.446
8:30.

44:43.704 --> 44:45.656
On your way, bell-bottom.

44:47.499 --> 44:50.494
Madame Dilyovska, I'm going out
with him tonight.

44:52.212 --> 44:53.413
Where?

44:55.215 --> 44:57.125
We forgot to say where!

45:00.428 --> 45:02.246
Top of the Empire State Building.

45:02.346 --> 45:03.915
But it's so high up.

45:04.015 --> 45:07.801
It won't seem high to me.
I'm in the clouds right now.

45:25.493 --> 45:30.147
You will not keep that date. You will be
at your job at Coney Island tonight.

45:30.247 --> 45:32.274
But Madame Dilyovska, just this once...

45:32.374 --> 45:36.236
"Meadowville, Indiana.
Dear Mr. And Mrs. Smith:"

45:36.336 --> 45:39.622
- What are you doing?
- I am composing letter to your parents.

45:40.089 --> 45:43.367
I will be at Coney Island
tonight at 12:00...

45:43.467 --> 45:47.413
and if you are not there at that time
I shall regretfully have to mail it.

45:47.513 --> 45:49.540
Madame Dilyovska, you wouldn't do that!

45:49.640 --> 45:50.666
Why not?

45:50.766 --> 45:52.592
But I have to meet him.

45:53.060 --> 45:54.586
I'll leave him at 11:30.

45:54.686 --> 45:58.306
You would better leave him
at 11:30 or...

46:15.538 --> 46:19.109
Look, there's Grant's Tomb.
I can see it just like in the pictures.

46:19.209 --> 46:20.576
Let me see.

46:20.793 --> 46:25.080
It says it was built in 1897 and
more than 15 million people have seen it.

46:26.048 --> 46:27.408
How do you like that?

46:27.508 --> 46:30.544
Hey, this thing's quit.
Have you got another dime?

46:30.719 --> 46:33.664
What do you want a dime for?
You can see me for nothing.

46:33.764 --> 46:35.131
I got one.

46:39.352 --> 46:42.805
Look, there's Symphonic Hall.
And it's so close, too.

46:45.316 --> 46:48.310
You know, Hildy,
I feel kind of guilty about Gabey.

46:48.610 --> 46:50.937
He's my pal and he looks after me.

46:51.321 --> 46:53.724
I mean, maybe we should have looked
for Ivy Smith.

46:53.824 --> 46:57.185
Here we go again. I tell you,
we never could have found her.

46:57.285 --> 46:59.278
Yeah, I guess you're right.

47:00.621 --> 47:03.991
There's the George Washington Bridge.
And the Music Hall.

47:04.250 --> 47:07.828
Why didn't I come up here sooner?
I wasted my whole day away.

47:08.128 --> 47:09.580
Thanks a lot.

47:13.258 --> 47:15.285
Hildy, I didn't mean that. I'm sorry.

47:15.385 --> 47:18.705
Get back to your telescope.
You two make a lovely couple.

47:18.805 --> 47:21.999
I don't want to look through the telescope.
I'd rather look at you.

47:22.099 --> 47:23.876
Whisper sweet nothings in my ear...

47:23.976 --> 47:27.379
like the population of the Bronx
or how many hot dogs were sold...

47:27.479 --> 47:29.089
last year at Yankee Stadium.

47:29.189 --> 47:33.427
Please, Hildy, don't be mad. I like you.
I think you're very pretty.

47:33.527 --> 47:36.396
You're the prettiest cab driver
I've ever seen.

47:36.780 --> 47:40.233
Tell it to your guidebook.
It means more to you than I do.

47:41.284 --> 47:42.485
There.

47:43.869 --> 47:45.946
Chip, you care.

47:47.164 --> 47:48.991
Why didn't you tell me?

47:49.708 --> 47:51.576
Gee, I don't know.

47:52.878 --> 47:55.205
"I'd like to whisper sweet nothings

47:55.672 --> 47:59.333
"Those words that everyone knows

48:00.718 --> 48:02.753
"But my thoughts get mangled

48:03.429 --> 48:06.090
"And all the words get tangled

48:07.516 --> 48:11.219
"But since you ask me, here goes

48:13.188 --> 48:16.224
"You're awful

48:17.442 --> 48:20.394
"Awful good to look at

48:21.571 --> 48:24.398
"Awful nice to be with

48:25.533 --> 48:29.278
"Awful sweet to have and hold

48:30.746 --> 48:32.614
"You're nothin'

48:34.082 --> 48:36.117
"Nothin' if not lovely

48:38.169 --> 48:40.580
"Nothin' if not dazzling

48:42.048 --> 48:44.750
"Nothin' but pure gold

48:47.136 --> 48:49.546
"You're frightening

48:50.180 --> 48:54.718
"Frightening me when you say
That you might go away

48:55.727 --> 48:57.553
"You're boring

48:58.480 --> 49:02.767
"Boring into my heart to stay

49:03.734 --> 49:06.145
"You're cheap, dear

49:06.904 --> 49:09.481
"Cheap at any price, dear

49:10.782 --> 49:13.485
"Cheap for such a diamond

49:14.911 --> 49:17.739
"Cheap for such a pearl

49:19.958 --> 49:24.286
"What I said before I'll say again

49:25.171 --> 49:27.498
"You're awful

49:29.341 --> 49:33.962
"Awful nice to be my girl

49:36.806 --> 49:39.175
"You're old, dear

49:39.892 --> 49:42.345
"Old with worldly wisdom

49:43.938 --> 49:46.640
"Old like Gorgonzola

49:47.900 --> 49:51.853
"Old like vintage French champagne

49:52.571 --> 49:54.731
"You're so-so

49:56.199 --> 49:58.943
"So, so kind of charming

50:00.370 --> 50:02.947
"So, so kind of witty

50:04.373 --> 50:07.076
"So I can't explain

50:09.586 --> 50:12.247
"Can't stand you

50:12.506 --> 50:16.960
"I can't stand you
to give some fellow the eye

50:17.635 --> 50:19.796
"Can't see you

50:20.888 --> 50:24.925
"In the arms of another guy

50:25.768 --> 50:27.719
"Who needs you

50:29.021 --> 50:31.640
"Needs you to distraction

50:33.150 --> 50:35.977
"Needs you till he's crazy

50:37.195 --> 50:40.606
"Needs you rain or shine

50:42.241 --> 50:44.852
"I'm the one who needs you

50:44.952 --> 50:48.489
"And I think you're awful

50:51.667 --> 50:56.496
"Awful nice to say you're mine"

51:05.429 --> 51:06.588
Chip!

51:08.307 --> 51:10.550
Hey, Oz! How are you?

51:13.145 --> 51:15.972
Wow! What a view!

51:18.608 --> 51:20.768
Glad I didn't join the Air Force.

51:20.985 --> 51:23.104
Did you find Miss Turnstiles?

51:23.487 --> 51:25.556
Not exactly. But I looked.

51:25.656 --> 51:27.316
Yeah, I looked, too.

51:27.491 --> 51:28.350
Yeah.

51:28.450 --> 51:29.484
Yeah.

51:29.660 --> 51:32.362
Well, tough luck not finding her.

51:32.996 --> 51:34.564
This must be the place.

51:34.664 --> 51:35.941
- Gabey!
- Hiya!

51:36.041 --> 51:37.525
- How are you?
- How you doin'?

51:37.625 --> 51:40.069
You'd think they hadn't seen each other
in years.

51:40.169 --> 51:42.288
Hiya, Claire. Hiya, Hildy.

51:44.507 --> 51:46.409
Gabe, I tried to find her.

51:46.509 --> 51:49.453
We looked all over. But let's face it,
the town's too big.

51:49.553 --> 51:53.798
Sure, sure. Say, what's the matter?
Did you get into a fight?

51:55.183 --> 51:57.919
- How did that get there?
- You know, Gabe, I saw her, too.

51:58.019 --> 51:59.462
- Yeah?
- Just for a flash.

51:59.562 --> 52:01.089
- Where?
- In Yonkers.

52:01.189 --> 52:03.299
A lot of photographers around her.

52:03.399 --> 52:05.718
Just had a quick flash
and then I lost her.

52:05.818 --> 52:08.137
- The town's pretty big, Gabe.
- Too big, yeah.

52:08.237 --> 52:09.513
Too big. Yeah.

52:09.613 --> 52:13.058
Look, fellas, don't worry about me.
I'm all booked up for tonight.

52:13.158 --> 52:14.476
Yeah? Nice girl?

52:14.576 --> 52:15.644
Sure.

52:15.744 --> 52:16.853
Ivy Smith.

52:16.953 --> 52:19.564
- No! Miss Turnstiles?
- What're you trying to put over?

52:19.664 --> 52:23.367
So help me, fellas, I found her.
She ought to be here any minute.

52:25.878 --> 52:28.205
- Hey, look! Cops!
- Duck, everybody!

52:28.714 --> 52:32.534
I'm sure he's up here, that sailor,
looks like the statue of Pithecanthropus.

52:32.634 --> 52:34.878
We'll take a look around the building.

52:37.889 --> 52:40.625
- Hey, that's my boss!
- Here, try these for size.

52:40.725 --> 52:43.794
- Do you recognize the other guy?
- The professor from the museum!

52:43.894 --> 52:47.347
- He seems to be looking for someone.
- Guess who, specimen?

52:49.858 --> 52:51.977
Hey, what am I gonna do?

52:52.361 --> 52:56.606
- I've gotta hide. Where am I gonna hide?
- There's no hiding place up here.

52:56.948 --> 52:57.849
Come on.

52:57.949 --> 53:00.484
My dinosaur... ruined. He broke it.

53:00.660 --> 53:02.278
Look. Sailors.

53:07.041 --> 53:09.735
- Having fun, kids?
- Yeah. Swell view from up here.

53:09.835 --> 53:13.363
Do you happen to know another sailor,
a fellow who goes to museums?

53:13.463 --> 53:18.543
Museums? Please. Sailors got other ways
of studying natural history.

53:19.219 --> 53:22.505
You haven't seen another sailor
hanging around here, have you?

53:24.015 --> 53:26.967
No. We haven't seen anyone
hanging around here.

53:31.730 --> 53:33.431
What's the matter with you?

53:33.648 --> 53:35.809
The altitude. It makes me sleepy.

53:41.489 --> 53:46.143
You say this sailor was at the Museum
of Anthropological History today at 11:30?

53:46.243 --> 53:47.061
Yes.

53:47.161 --> 53:48.479
You're sure of his description?

53:48.579 --> 53:51.440
I'll never forget him.
He has black hair, blue eyes...

53:51.540 --> 53:53.734
about five feet, eleven inches tall...

53:53.834 --> 53:58.113
<i>looks exactly like the statue of
Pithecanthropus erectus, exactly.</i>

53:58.213 --> 54:01.040
We're looking for three sailors
and a lady cab driver.

54:01.215 --> 54:06.003
A lady cab driver! Oh, how revolting!
Claire, did you ever...

54:09.264 --> 54:12.918
You haven't seen 'em? Come along, Tracy.
I guess they're not up here.

54:13.018 --> 54:16.930
Awe-inspirin', isn't it?
Majestic, that's what it is.

54:17.230 --> 54:20.224
- It does a man's soul good to...
- Come on, Tracy.

54:27.531 --> 54:29.350
What's the matter? Lose something?

54:29.450 --> 54:33.020
- You poor darling! You brave thing!
- Why didn't you get rid of 'em sooner?

54:33.120 --> 54:35.856
All these hours in the air!
I could get my wings for this.

54:35.956 --> 54:38.691
- Or a striped suit. Let's go.
- No, I gotta wait for Ivy.

54:38.791 --> 54:41.235
I don't believe you met her at all.
Where is she?

54:41.335 --> 54:45.497
She had some big society affair to go to.
Maybe she had trouble breaking it.

54:45.923 --> 54:49.167
Society affair? What does he think
Miss Turnstiles is?

54:49.301 --> 54:52.412
He thinks she's a big celebrity.
Why tell him she's nobody?

54:52.512 --> 54:54.039
It's his one day in town.

54:54.139 --> 54:55.632
Oh, I get it.

54:56.182 --> 54:59.886
I don't know what could have happened.
She promised me she'd be here.

55:00.937 --> 55:01.879
Ivy!

55:01.979 --> 55:04.090
Gabey! I'm sorry I'm late. But...

55:04.190 --> 55:05.841
I thought you'd never get here.

55:05.941 --> 55:09.386
I had a lot of trouble breaking
my engagement, but I'm glad I did.

55:09.486 --> 55:13.223
Me, too. Well, here she is,
Miss Turnstiles.

55:13.323 --> 55:14.808
What do you know?

55:14.908 --> 55:18.653
Ivy, this is Hildy, Claire, Ozzie, Chip.

55:19.579 --> 55:22.231
Ladies and gentlemen,
we're off on a lark.

55:22.331 --> 55:24.942
I've got one suggestion
before we embark.

55:25.042 --> 55:27.736
There are lots of nice things
to do in the dark...

55:27.836 --> 55:31.373
but let's not go rowing in Central Park.

55:32.299 --> 55:34.451
"We're going on the town

55:34.551 --> 55:35.577
"New York

55:35.677 --> 55:37.795
"We're riding on a rocket

55:38.930 --> 55:40.923
"We're gonna really sock it

55:42.141 --> 55:44.176
"Because tonight's the night

55:45.478 --> 55:47.304
"We're goin' on a toot

55:48.814 --> 55:51.016
"We're goin' to raise a riot

55:52.150 --> 55:54.477
"The Brooklyn Bridge, we'll buy it

55:55.403 --> 55:56.888
"And hit the Heights tonight

55:56.988 --> 55:59.098
"Get high as kites tonight

55:59.198 --> 56:03.486
"East side, West side, round the city

56:05.830 --> 56:09.992
"One day, one night, that's the pity

56:11.793 --> 56:13.703
"But we won't look ahead

56:15.171 --> 56:18.249
"Or let the light of dawn get us down

56:19.300 --> 56:20.827
"We're really livin', Jack

56:20.927 --> 56:24.004
"We're goin' on the town"

56:24.638 --> 56:26.048
Stop, fellas!

56:27.808 --> 56:31.386
"What're we sayin'? Look over there.
The fleet.

56:31.770 --> 56:33.797
"Doesn't she look sweet?

56:33.897 --> 56:36.099
"What did we leave it for?

56:36.524 --> 56:39.352
"What are we doing on shore?

56:40.528 --> 56:43.189
"We're simply crazy about the Navy

56:43.322 --> 56:44.857
"How's that?

56:45.032 --> 56:47.609
"We love it more than we can say

56:47.743 --> 56:49.111
"How nice

56:49.453 --> 56:51.647
"We get lots of good fresh air

56:51.747 --> 56:53.899
"The ocean is everywhere

56:53.999 --> 56:57.152
"That's why we hate to get leave
and go away

56:57.252 --> 57:00.321
"It's just so touching
Hear them say

57:00.421 --> 57:04.659
"'Hate to get a leave and go away
Hate to leave the ship where life is play

57:04.759 --> 57:07.044
"'All the livelong day'

57:07.177 --> 57:10.339
"Just think what we could be doin' today

57:11.056 --> 57:13.883
"We could be swabbing the decks

57:14.392 --> 57:16.719
"Sweeping the bunks with a broom

57:17.604 --> 57:20.506
"We could be shoveling tons of coal

57:20.606 --> 57:23.517
"Down in the boiler room

57:25.152 --> 57:27.563
"Got news

57:28.072 --> 57:31.683
"We got those shore-leave blues

57:31.783 --> 57:35.070
"It's just so touching

57:35.245 --> 57:38.523
"Hear him sob
He wants a pretty little deck to swab

57:38.623 --> 57:43.528
"Polish up the railings and the knobs
Poor unhappy gobs

57:43.628 --> 57:48.081
"Oh, we got news,
we got the shore-leave blues

57:48.966 --> 57:50.500
"Especially me

57:50.759 --> 57:52.586
"I miss the chow

57:53.386 --> 57:57.298
"And that's not all, my friends

57:57.432 --> 58:01.052
"Just think of this:

58:01.269 --> 58:02.511
"Travel

58:03.354 --> 58:04.638
"Adventure

58:05.272 --> 58:06.724
"See the world

58:26.876 --> 58:29.911
"The Navy. The Navy.

58:30.129 --> 58:32.497
"Absolutely nothing does it lack

58:32.714 --> 58:35.750
"And in the morning, tomorrow morning

58:36.217 --> 58:38.912
"They'll have to come and drag us back

58:39.012 --> 58:41.964
"On a spree
On a tear

58:42.223 --> 58:46.802
"We're going north, south, east, west
Everywhere!

58:51.732 --> 58:53.683
"We're goin' on the town

58:54.901 --> 58:57.228
"We're kickin' back the traces

58:58.071 --> 59:00.189
"We're gonna do the places

59:01.240 --> 59:03.109
"We've never done before

59:04.452 --> 59:06.445
"We're goin' on the loose

59:07.538 --> 59:09.740
"We're blowin' all our dough in

59:10.624 --> 59:12.993
"And we'll keep right on goin'

59:13.752 --> 59:17.205
"As if no one before had any fun before

59:17.547 --> 59:21.542
"Hot spots, swank spots,
roofs and cellars

59:23.803 --> 59:25.538
"Three smart girls

59:25.638 --> 59:27.965
"And three slick fellers

59:29.558 --> 59:31.551
"We're gonna paint it red

59:32.811 --> 59:35.472
"We'll fill 'em up
and then drink 'em down

59:36.648 --> 59:38.133
"Let's have a ball tonight

59:38.233 --> 59:41.936
"We're goin' on the town!"

59:52.579 --> 59:54.981
- Looks a wee bit crowded.
- Leave it to me.

59:55.081 --> 59:57.484
Waiter! Table for six, please.
Best you've got.

59:57.584 --> 59:59.527
I'm sorry, sir. We are all filled up.

59:59.627 --> 01:00:02.989
All filled up? I hear that's what
they always say in New York.

01:00:03.089 --> 01:00:06.909
You better start scraping and bowing now
because the lady with me...

01:00:07.009 --> 01:00:09.828
happens to be none other than
the famous Miss Turnstiles.

01:00:09.928 --> 01:00:11.038
Gabey, please...

01:00:11.138 --> 01:00:13.874
Miss Turnstiles? What are you
talking about? No room.

01:00:13.974 --> 01:00:16.751
Hey, you heard me. Miss Turnstiles
for June. Ivy Smith.

01:00:16.851 --> 01:00:19.762
What is this, Miss Turnstiles?
Go away, Sailor.

01:00:21.689 --> 01:00:23.966
Hey, François!
Build us a table, will you?

01:00:24.066 --> 01:00:26.643
I'm sorry, madame. There are no tables.

01:00:27.194 --> 01:00:29.096
Of course, madame. A table, surely.

01:00:29.196 --> 01:00:30.431
Garçon! Table.

01:00:30.531 --> 01:00:34.101
See that girl over there? Make a big fuss
over her. Miss Turnstiles.

01:00:34.201 --> 01:00:38.488
- Miss Turnstiles? What is that?
- Never mind. Just make a fuss. Go ahead.

01:00:38.621 --> 01:00:42.733
Miss Turnstiles! We are so proud
and happy to have you here.

01:00:42.833 --> 01:00:47.579
Please come in. Our humble establishment
welcomes you with wide open doors.

01:01:02.435 --> 01:01:04.795
There, you see! It worked like a charm.

01:01:04.895 --> 01:01:06.881
It was nothing, really.

01:01:06.981 --> 01:01:09.633
Gosh, this is a great table, huh?

01:01:09.733 --> 01:01:10.892
Yeah.

01:01:11.360 --> 01:01:12.894
Those girls are pretty.

01:01:14.905 --> 01:01:16.981
Well, folks, what will it be?

01:01:18.449 --> 01:01:21.477
Say, what's in this Explodo Bomborino?
Sounds good.

01:01:21.577 --> 01:01:24.814
Four kinds of rum, brandy, grenadine,
lime juice, papaya juice...

01:01:24.914 --> 01:01:27.691
and the white of one duck egg.
Only 12 to a customer.

01:01:27.791 --> 01:01:29.818
How about this one,
Dreamland Nightmare?

01:01:29.918 --> 01:01:33.030
Vodka, champagne, prune juice,
floating chopped chives...

01:01:33.130 --> 01:01:36.082
- He'll have a beer.
- Yeah, beer all around.

01:01:37.759 --> 01:01:39.369
Pardon me, madame.

01:01:39.469 --> 01:01:44.081
I'm so sorry. It was an accident.
I didn't really mean to sit on your lap.

01:01:44.181 --> 01:01:47.001
I hope you all aren't hurt,
but I was pushed and...

01:01:47.101 --> 01:01:48.302
Scram!

01:01:49.353 --> 01:01:50.637
Hey, look!

01:01:53.398 --> 01:01:55.642
Look out! Here she comes again!

01:01:56.234 --> 01:01:59.270
- Where are those drinks?
- Here you are, folks.

01:02:03.574 --> 01:02:06.527
Just what I wanted.
A mug of solid glass.

01:02:09.872 --> 01:02:12.941
"That's all there is, folks!
So, goodnight to you

01:02:13.041 --> 01:02:16.578
"We hope you like
our Sambacabana review!"

01:02:25.428 --> 01:02:28.255
Come on, let's dance
before the stampede starts.

01:02:28.430 --> 01:02:31.091
All right, specimen. Let's go primitive.

01:02:34.895 --> 01:02:36.763
Just a minute, Ozzie.

01:02:36.980 --> 01:02:38.423
- Oh, François?
- Yes, madame?

01:02:38.523 --> 01:02:40.800
Champagne, compliments of the house?

01:02:40.900 --> 01:02:44.395
Yes, madame. With pleasure.
Compliments of the house.

01:02:48.449 --> 01:02:51.018
Luckily we got leave
when we hit here, otherwise...

01:02:51.118 --> 01:02:54.779
Champagne for Miss Turnstiles.
Compliments of the house.

01:02:55.914 --> 01:02:58.491
Thank you. Isn't that nice?

01:02:58.666 --> 01:03:00.368
Gee, that's terrific.

01:03:00.543 --> 01:03:03.905
Gosh, I guess this happens to you
all the time, wherever you go.

01:03:04.005 --> 01:03:06.165
Yes, on and off.

01:03:08.217 --> 01:03:09.576
What shall we drink to?

01:03:09.676 --> 01:03:11.662
Let's drink to New York.

01:03:11.762 --> 01:03:13.004
New York.

01:03:17.767 --> 01:03:20.303
It must be so exciting in the Navy.

01:03:20.478 --> 01:03:24.598
You go all over the world
from one big city to another, and...

01:03:24.940 --> 01:03:27.601
you see all kinds of strange places...

01:03:29.153 --> 01:03:31.388
and you meet all kinds of girls.

01:03:31.488 --> 01:03:35.600
Yeah, well, when you only spend
a short time in some place you...

01:03:35.700 --> 01:03:39.103
don't want to get too involved
with any one particular girl.

01:03:39.203 --> 01:03:42.156
I mean, you might never see her again.

01:03:43.582 --> 01:03:47.953
Of course, it's best to just have
a good time and not think about tomorrow.

01:03:48.921 --> 01:03:53.041
Yeah, when we push off tomorrow,
I guess this'll all seem like a dream.

01:03:54.134 --> 01:03:58.379
That's why I think it's silly to get
too involved, because...

01:03:59.180 --> 01:04:00.381
I know.

01:04:00.973 --> 01:04:03.134
Getting involved, it's so...

01:04:04.143 --> 01:04:06.845
so involving.

01:04:18.573 --> 01:04:19.816
Oh, Ivy.

01:04:22.076 --> 01:04:24.069
Wait! Don't tell us.

01:04:24.620 --> 01:04:28.232
You were just asking this young lady
where you could find Miss Turnstiles.

01:04:28.332 --> 01:04:31.193
- Look! Champagne.
- The guy just come over and said:

01:04:31.293 --> 01:04:33.987
"Champagne for Miss Turnstiles.
Compliments of the house."

01:04:34.087 --> 01:04:35.113
Real champagne?

01:04:35.213 --> 01:04:39.208
Yeah, not cream soda, not celery tonic,
but real champagne.

01:04:39.968 --> 01:04:42.995
This is great.
I never had champagne before.

01:04:43.095 --> 01:04:46.882
Ozzie, if you say the bubbles
tickle your nose, I'll drown you.

01:04:47.224 --> 01:04:50.627
- Let's have a toast.
- All right. This one's for the boys.

01:04:50.727 --> 01:04:53.296
Here's to the girls we found
in the great big city.

01:04:53.396 --> 01:04:56.724
And this one's for the girls.
Here's to being found.

01:05:03.572 --> 01:05:05.975
"That's all there is, folks
So goodnight to you

01:05:06.075 --> 01:05:09.319
"We hope you liked our little
Dixieland Revue"

01:05:16.251 --> 01:05:17.569
Come on, let's dance.

01:05:17.669 --> 01:05:19.821
We'd just go out
and get crushed to death.

01:05:19.921 --> 01:05:21.622
What a way to die.

01:05:27.928 --> 01:05:32.124
Ivy, I didn't mean what I said
about not getting involved with a girl...

01:05:32.224 --> 01:05:34.084
I may never see again.

01:05:34.184 --> 01:05:35.260
No?

01:05:35.852 --> 01:05:40.089
No. This isn't just one of those things
where a sailor picks up a girl...

01:05:40.189 --> 01:05:44.310
for just one day. I have a feeling
I'm going to see you again.

01:05:44.610 --> 01:05:46.011
I'm so glad you said that...

01:05:46.111 --> 01:05:50.182
I know you're glamorous and famous, Ivy,
and maybe you came along tonight...

01:05:50.282 --> 01:05:54.102
- ...just to be nice to a guy on leave...
- That's not true, Gabey.

01:05:54.202 --> 01:05:56.896
I came along tonight
because I wanted to be with you...

01:05:56.996 --> 01:05:59.357
more than anything else in the world.

01:05:59.457 --> 01:06:00.700
Honest?

01:06:00.917 --> 01:06:02.410
Yes, Gabey.

01:06:02.710 --> 01:06:05.404
Then I know we're gonna see
each other again.

01:06:05.504 --> 01:06:08.073
In the meantime, we have
the whole night ahead of us.

01:06:08.173 --> 01:06:10.659
- It's only 11:30 now and...
- 11:30!

01:06:10.759 --> 01:06:12.828
Yeah. What's the matter, Ivy?

01:06:12.928 --> 01:06:16.881
Gabey, I don't know
how to tell you this but...

01:06:17.057 --> 01:06:18.541
Ivy, what is it?

01:06:18.641 --> 01:06:21.419
Gabey, I've something to tell you.

01:06:21.519 --> 01:06:23.087
Hey, Gabe, Gabey!

01:06:23.187 --> 01:06:24.722
Hiya, Gabe.

01:06:24.980 --> 01:06:27.516
Hey, Simpkins, Kovarski.

01:06:27.650 --> 01:06:29.927
Say, there are two guys from my ship.

01:06:30.027 --> 01:06:33.722
Ivy, I want them to meet you in person.
Wait here, I'll bring 'em right over.

01:06:33.822 --> 01:06:36.191
- But Gabey...
- I'll only be a second.

01:06:37.409 --> 01:06:40.853
Hiya, fellas.
How's the big town treatin' ya?

01:06:40.953 --> 01:06:43.523
- Not bad, not bad. Daisy, Ella, Gabe.
- Hello, girls.

01:06:43.623 --> 01:06:45.941
How's the Meadowville menace doin'?

01:06:46.041 --> 01:06:47.610
I hit the jackpot today.

01:06:47.710 --> 01:06:50.446
Nothin' much, just the most famous girl
in New York City.

01:06:50.546 --> 01:06:52.447
Who, the Statue of Liberty?

01:06:52.547 --> 01:06:55.450
Twice as famous,
Miss Turnstiles for June.

01:06:55.550 --> 01:06:58.328
- Yeah? Who's that?
- Who's that? Are you kiddin'?

01:06:58.428 --> 01:07:00.455
Her picture's up all over the subway...

01:07:00.555 --> 01:07:01.539
Where is she?

01:07:01.639 --> 01:07:04.375
Over here. Come over to the table.
I'll introduce you.

01:07:04.475 --> 01:07:07.261
- Excuse us, girls. We'll be right back.
- Excuse us.

01:07:07.686 --> 01:07:10.597
The grass is always greener,
if you know what I mean.

01:07:10.814 --> 01:07:12.466
How'd you meet a dame like that?

01:07:12.566 --> 01:07:17.061
Magnetism, boys, sheer magnetism.
She was drawn to me...

01:07:18.363 --> 01:07:22.024
- She must have gone to powder her nose.
- Oh, sure. Yeah.

01:07:27.538 --> 01:07:29.906
I'll introduce you later, fellas.

01:07:38.173 --> 01:07:38.990
Gabe.

01:07:39.090 --> 01:07:42.752
- I just stepped out for a bit of air.
- Yeah, we read the note.

01:07:42.927 --> 01:07:44.161
Too bad, Gabe.

01:07:44.261 --> 01:07:47.414
What do you mean? As a matter of fact,
I'm kind of relieved.

01:07:47.514 --> 01:07:50.042
You know these famous gals,
so stuck on themselves.

01:07:50.142 --> 01:07:53.337
Who needs 'em? Now that I'm on my own,
I'll have me a real time.

01:07:53.437 --> 01:07:55.714
So long, girls.
See you back on the ship, guys.

01:07:55.814 --> 01:07:58.758
Why don't you stick with us?
You could get another date.

01:07:58.858 --> 01:08:01.719
Claire'll get you a date.
Claire, how about a girl for Gabe?

01:08:01.819 --> 01:08:03.137
I don't know any girls.

01:08:03.237 --> 01:08:05.848
I can get you a date.
My roommate, Lucy Shmeeler.

01:08:05.948 --> 01:08:06.724
What?

01:08:06.824 --> 01:08:09.727
She's a nice girl.
She hasn't been out in years.

01:08:09.827 --> 01:08:12.396
- She's swell. You'll like her.
- You'll like her.

01:08:12.496 --> 01:08:14.523
How about it? I can phone her right now.

01:08:14.623 --> 01:08:17.399
Sure. Why not? The night's young.
Come on.

01:08:17.500 --> 01:08:20.069
We'll paint this town pink,
green and yellow.

01:08:20.169 --> 01:08:21.996
Get in there. Come on.

01:08:31.345 --> 01:08:33.749
"That's all there is, folks
So goodnight to you

01:08:33.849 --> 01:08:36.676
"We hope you liked our little
Shanghai Revue"

01:08:43.399 --> 01:08:44.884
- How you doin', Gabe?
- Great.

01:08:44.984 --> 01:08:47.428
Not thinking about that Miss Turnstiles,
are you?

01:08:47.528 --> 01:08:50.229
Who's that? Never heard of her.
Bottoms up.

01:08:50.822 --> 01:08:52.890
Where's that heavy date you promised me?

01:08:52.991 --> 01:08:55.769
- What's keeping Miss Shmeeler?
- She should be here by now.

01:08:55.868 --> 01:08:59.522
When I told her about Gabey, she was
out of the house before I could hang up.

01:08:59.622 --> 01:09:02.241
- Playin' hard to get, huh?
- Where is she?

01:09:02.959 --> 01:09:04.326
Hello, Lucy.

01:09:04.794 --> 01:09:07.746
Hello. Oh, hello, Chip.

01:09:12.884 --> 01:09:15.252
Well, now we've all got dates.

01:09:15.636 --> 01:09:17.788
Lucy, this is Claire, and this is...

01:09:17.889 --> 01:09:20.917
Don't tell me. I know.
I'll bet you're Gabey.

01:09:21.017 --> 01:09:23.085
No. He's the lucky fellow.

01:09:23.185 --> 01:09:25.136
The luck of the Irish.

01:09:25.813 --> 01:09:29.599
- Won't you sit down, Miss Shmeeler?
- Thank you, thank you. Yes.

01:09:31.859 --> 01:09:33.353
Gesundheit.

01:09:33.737 --> 01:09:37.148
That's the nicest thing
anybody ever said to me.

01:09:37.907 --> 01:09:39.600
Here. You got a cold, huh?

01:09:39.701 --> 01:09:42.028
It's just a little sniffle.

01:09:43.328 --> 01:09:45.898
Nothing a ton of penicillin won't cure.

01:09:45.997 --> 01:09:50.702
But it's not catching.
No, not even if you get real close.

01:09:55.924 --> 01:09:57.959
Come on, Hildy. We'd better dance.

01:09:59.302 --> 01:10:01.045
Let's go, Claire.

01:10:03.431 --> 01:10:05.708
Have a drink, Miss Shmeeler.

01:10:05.808 --> 01:10:07.509
I don't mind if I do.

01:10:08.018 --> 01:10:10.921
You know, I was planning
a quiet evening at home...

01:10:11.021 --> 01:10:15.683
but when Hildy called and said that
the Navy was in distress, well, I just flew.

01:10:15.900 --> 01:10:19.854
Hildy can tell you
I'm just "a streetcar named impulsive."

01:10:20.405 --> 01:10:22.940
- Well, here's to...
- Here's to us.

01:10:27.286 --> 01:10:28.862
My, that's strong.

01:10:29.329 --> 01:10:32.899
<i>- Did you see The Lost Weekend?
- See it? I feel as though I was in it.</i>

01:10:32.999 --> 01:10:35.493
I mean, until you came along, Lucy.

01:10:35.877 --> 01:10:38.329
That calls for a real toast!

01:10:38.755 --> 01:10:40.823
Let's pretend this is champagne.

01:10:40.923 --> 01:10:41.741
Champagne?

01:10:41.841 --> 01:10:45.202
Yes, and we'll do the real
old-fashioned champagne toast.

01:10:45.302 --> 01:10:47.371
- Let's interlock arms...
- No, really...

01:10:47.471 --> 01:10:49.456
Come on. It's so Viennese!

01:10:49.556 --> 01:10:51.007
Hey, Gabe!

01:10:51.266 --> 01:10:52.509
Hiya.

01:10:55.353 --> 01:10:57.172
- It's a small world.
- Hello, fellas.

01:10:57.272 --> 01:11:00.717
- How about that introduction?
- Go away. Can't you see I'm busy?

01:11:00.817 --> 01:11:04.053
Give us a break. We want to see
the most beautiful gal in New York.

01:11:04.153 --> 01:11:06.013
We wanna meet the little bombshell.

01:11:06.113 --> 01:11:10.400
- Come on, fellas. You know how it is.
- Gabey, you're smothering me.

01:11:10.576 --> 01:11:11.735
Hello.

01:11:16.748 --> 01:11:21.494
Miss Shmeeler, this is First Class Seamen
Simpkins and Kovarski.

01:11:22.211 --> 01:11:26.290
- Pleased to meet you, miss.
- Yeah. We been lookin' forward to this.

01:11:27.424 --> 01:11:30.786
It'll give us a lot to talk about
back on the ship, won't it, Gabe?

01:11:30.886 --> 01:11:31.703
Yeah.

01:11:31.803 --> 01:11:33.538
Well, so long.

01:11:33.638 --> 01:11:34.839
Goodbye.

01:11:35.307 --> 01:11:37.508
Magnetism, that's what it is.

01:11:38.643 --> 01:11:40.261
Sheer magnetism.

01:11:43.689 --> 01:11:44.932
Goodbye.

01:11:45.649 --> 01:11:47.351
Oh, they're sweet.

01:11:49.486 --> 01:11:52.689
Excuse me a minute, Lucy.
I gotta get some cigarettes.

01:11:56.159 --> 01:11:58.394
I don't think Gabey's very happy
about this.

01:11:58.494 --> 01:12:00.863
Amazing. Amazing deduction.

01:12:02.248 --> 01:12:03.365
Look!

01:12:12.424 --> 01:12:13.825
Drinkin' alone, partner?

01:12:13.925 --> 01:12:15.577
We don't like that around here!

01:12:15.677 --> 01:12:17.203
We don't cotton to it no how.

01:12:17.303 --> 01:12:19.247
Looks like you're trying to ditch us.

01:12:19.347 --> 01:12:22.333
You can't get away with it.
Reckon you're stuck with us.

01:12:22.433 --> 01:12:24.760
Yep! We're your pals, pal!

01:12:25.311 --> 01:12:28.714
"Oh, when you feel downhearted
You must remember this

01:12:28.814 --> 01:12:31.725
"Things never are as bad
as they could be

01:12:32.234 --> 01:12:35.554
"When friends have all departed
There's one you'll never miss

01:12:35.654 --> 01:12:38.389
"I'll be right with you
You can count on me

01:12:38.489 --> 01:12:39.557
"Yeah!

01:12:39.657 --> 01:12:42.109
"You can count on me

01:12:43.160 --> 01:12:45.946
"You can count on me

01:12:46.580 --> 01:12:49.858
"As the adding machine once said:

01:12:49.958 --> 01:12:52.661
"'You can count on me'

01:12:53.003 --> 01:12:56.456
"If you committed murder
And got caught like a dope

01:12:56.589 --> 01:12:59.709
"And had to hang
until your life was done

01:13:00.051 --> 01:13:03.454
"I'd holler: 'Go no further
Boys, fetch another rope

01:13:03.554 --> 01:13:06.290
"'I'm hangin' with him
I'll stick to you, son'

01:13:06.390 --> 01:13:07.458
"Yeah!

01:13:07.558 --> 01:13:09.293
"I'll stick to you, son

01:13:09.393 --> 01:13:10.961
"I'll always be beside you

01:13:11.061 --> 01:13:12.671
"I'll stick to you, son

01:13:12.771 --> 01:13:14.464
"We'll go through life together

01:13:14.564 --> 01:13:18.009
"As the fly paper told the fly:

01:13:18.109 --> 01:13:20.303
"'I'll stick to you, son'

01:13:20.403 --> 01:13:21.604
"Yeah!

01:13:22.238 --> 01:13:23.689
"Stick to you

01:13:23.948 --> 01:13:25.482
"Stick to you

01:13:25.741 --> 01:13:27.143
"Stick to you

01:13:27.243 --> 01:13:28.644
"Stick to you

01:13:28.744 --> 01:13:30.445
"I'll stick to you

01:13:31.705 --> 01:13:35.108
"Oh, if you miss your mother
A million miles from home

01:13:35.208 --> 01:13:37.318
"Think of how you once clung to her knee

01:13:37.418 --> 01:13:38.528
"Your mother's knee

01:13:38.628 --> 01:13:41.956
"Although there is no other
On land or sea or foam

01:13:42.173 --> 01:13:45.000
"When you're in town, kid,
you can cling to me

01:13:46.635 --> 01:13:47.961
"Cling to me

01:13:48.554 --> 01:13:49.921
"Cling to me

"You can cling to me

"If through a lot of foolery
You lost your last red cent

01:13:59.814 --> 01:14:01.966
"I wouldn't even stop to ask you why

01:14:02.066 --> 01:14:03.176
"To ask you why

01:14:03.276 --> 01:14:06.679
"I'd pawn my mother's jewelry
I'd steal my sister's rent

01:14:06.779 --> 01:14:09.606
"It's all for you, kid,
you can milk me dry

01:14:10.782 --> 01:14:13.151
"You can milk me dry

01:14:14.411 --> 01:14:16.779
"You can milk me dry

01:14:17.956 --> 01:14:21.158
"As the cow to the farmer said:

01:14:21.542 --> 01:14:23.911
"'You can milk me dry'

01:14:39.684 --> 01:14:43.462
"If on an island
We two were cast astray

01:14:43.562 --> 01:14:47.015
"I'd make it into paradise, indeed

01:14:48.275 --> 01:14:52.729
"If rescue came
you'd only shriek at them 'Go away! '

01:14:53.029 --> 01:14:56.608
"Because you'd find
that I am all you need

01:14:58.409 --> 01:15:01.529
"I am all you need

01:15:03.205 --> 01:15:06.075
"I am all you need

"I am all you need

"I am all you need

"You can count on me!"

01:15:59.257 --> 01:16:01.000
This is where I live.

01:16:01.801 --> 01:16:04.203
It was very nice of you to take me home.

01:16:04.303 --> 01:16:06.330
That's all right, Lucy. And thanks.

01:16:06.430 --> 01:16:08.415
Would you like to come up for a minute?

01:16:08.515 --> 01:16:11.585
No, I guess not.
The others are waiting for me.

01:16:11.685 --> 01:16:14.345
Besides, I'm not
very good company tonight.

01:16:14.938 --> 01:16:16.965
I guess I showed you a pretty dull time.

01:16:17.065 --> 01:16:19.642
Oh, no! I had a marvelous time.

01:16:20.443 --> 01:16:23.262
At last I have something
to write in my diary.

01:16:23.362 --> 01:16:25.898
I've been using it for laundry lists.

01:16:26.365 --> 01:16:29.151
No, really, I'm sorry
about tonight, Lucy.

01:16:29.910 --> 01:16:34.239
You know, somewhere in the world
there's a right girl for every boy.

01:16:35.248 --> 01:16:38.659
I guess I found the one for me
before I even met you.

01:16:39.168 --> 01:16:42.329
I tried, but I can't forget her.

01:16:43.297 --> 01:16:44.957
But don't you worry.

01:16:45.341 --> 01:16:47.084
You'll find your guy.

01:16:47.760 --> 01:16:49.670
You're a nice girl, Lucy.

01:16:52.431 --> 01:16:53.623
Goodnight.

01:16:53.723 --> 01:16:55.341
Oh, you bad boy.

01:16:55.850 --> 01:16:58.344
Now, I won't wash my cheek for a year.

01:16:58.978 --> 01:17:00.346
Goodnight.

01:17:23.668 --> 01:17:25.327
"A Day In New York.

01:17:26.170 --> 01:17:27.871
"A comedy in three acts."

01:24:49.993 --> 01:24:51.278
Hey, Gabe!

01:24:51.495 --> 01:24:52.562
Hello, Chip.

01:24:52.662 --> 01:24:55.106
I got kind of worried
that you wouldn't come back.

01:24:55.206 --> 01:24:57.116
Thanks, Chip. I'm okay.

01:24:58.459 --> 01:25:01.120
I know how tough
you're takin' this, Gabe.

01:25:01.295 --> 01:25:04.206
I know you know. That's why I love you.

01:25:05.424 --> 01:25:06.708
Come on.

01:25:12.681 --> 01:25:16.418
When I danced in Imperial Palace
before Czar, he wept...

01:25:16.518 --> 01:25:20.588
tears streaming on floor.
I had to do next number in galoshes.

01:25:20.688 --> 01:25:22.590
- Madame Dilyovska.
- Yes, what is it?

01:25:22.690 --> 01:25:24.091
Miss Smith's young friend.

01:25:24.191 --> 01:25:25.801
- Where is she?
- Who?

01:25:25.901 --> 01:25:29.888
Ivy Smith. She had to go to a big society
party. Maybe you know where she is.

01:25:29.988 --> 01:25:34.601
Big society party! This party is at
Coney Island, the playground of the rich.

01:25:34.701 --> 01:25:37.395
- Coney Island!
- Yes, at Tilyou Avenue and the Boardwalk.

01:25:37.495 --> 01:25:38.521
I know where she is.

01:25:38.621 --> 01:25:40.398
- What's she doing there?
- I don't know.

01:25:40.498 --> 01:25:41.524
Let's go.

01:25:41.624 --> 01:25:44.535
I know the shortest way out.
We'll be there in no time.

01:25:45.044 --> 01:25:47.821
- If I don't get my cab back...
- Look! That's them!

01:25:47.921 --> 01:25:49.281
That's the cab.

01:25:49.381 --> 01:25:50.916
Hey, you, stop!

01:26:01.392 --> 01:26:02.543
Hey, fellows...

01:26:02.643 --> 01:26:04.178
where's the fire?

01:26:05.271 --> 01:26:08.465
We're the fire! Hey, it's them!
They're after us!

01:26:08.565 --> 01:26:09.633
- Who?
- The cops!

01:26:09.733 --> 01:26:11.601
- Hildy, step on it.
- Okay.

01:26:14.404 --> 01:26:17.349
Hildy, they're catching up with us.
I can see their faces.

01:26:17.449 --> 01:26:19.475
It's no fun for them, either.
They can see yours.

01:26:19.575 --> 01:26:21.144
Do you think we can lose them?

01:26:21.244 --> 01:26:24.397
I know a place across the Brooklyn Bridge
where no one'll find us.

01:26:24.497 --> 01:26:26.240
- What is it?
- Brooklyn.

01:26:42.513 --> 01:26:44.506
Get up there. You can see better.

01:26:44.640 --> 01:26:46.091
Are they close?

01:26:46.475 --> 01:26:48.885
Any closer and we'd be chasin' them.

01:26:49.478 --> 01:26:51.046
- You better go faster.
- Hurry.

01:26:51.146 --> 01:26:53.090
- Give her the gun.
- Hold on.

01:26:53.190 --> 01:26:56.885
All police cars in the vicinity. Coming off
the east end of Brooklyn Bridge.

01:26:56.985 --> 01:26:59.312
<i>- Heading east.
- Okay. Let's go.</i>

01:27:04.992 --> 01:27:06.777
We just picked up another one!

01:27:34.936 --> 01:27:37.881
- I bet we're losing 'em.
- They're multiplying like schmos.

01:27:37.981 --> 01:27:39.974
Pull into that fruit stand!

01:27:51.910 --> 01:27:54.612
I wonder who's minding
the police station?

01:28:15.098 --> 01:28:18.918
This is Tilyou Avenue and the Boardwalk.
I wonder what she could be doing here.

01:28:19.018 --> 01:28:21.796
- Doesn't look like a society party to me.
- Shut up, Chip.

01:28:21.896 --> 01:28:24.215
Inside we feature Princess Yvette...

01:28:24.315 --> 01:28:27.176
the girl who picks up the handkerchief
with her teeth.

01:28:27.276 --> 01:28:28.435
Ivy!

01:28:28.944 --> 01:28:30.103
Gabey!

01:28:31.280 --> 01:28:33.648
All right, step up. Step up, folks.

01:28:35.950 --> 01:28:36.601
Ivy!

01:28:36.701 --> 01:28:40.021
Keep away from me! Keep away from me!
Now you know everything.

01:28:40.121 --> 01:28:43.616
Here I am, Miss Turnstiles,
the famous celebrity.

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:45.860
This is my big society party.

01:28:45.960 --> 01:28:48.195
Why are you here?
You're not in the blue book.

01:28:48.295 --> 01:28:51.365
Why did you leave me?
I thought I'd never see you again!

01:28:51.465 --> 01:28:54.284
I had to come to work. I work here.
That's what I do.

01:28:54.384 --> 01:28:56.620
I'm a kootch dancer.
I have to work because...

01:28:56.720 --> 01:29:00.290
I owe Madame Dilyovska money
for my lessons, and I have to pay her.

01:29:00.390 --> 01:29:02.291
Excuse me, I have to go on now.

01:29:02.391 --> 01:29:06.387
Ivy, I don't care about any of that.
I don't care what you do.

01:29:06.645 --> 01:29:09.757
All I care about is
that I've found you again.

01:29:09.857 --> 01:29:13.893
Ivy, I thought I'd lost you forever.
Why did you run away?

01:29:15.153 --> 01:29:19.190
Because I couldn't tell you about this.
I lied to you so much.

01:29:19.699 --> 01:29:22.693
Did you think that would have made
any difference?

01:29:22.868 --> 01:29:25.195
And Madame Dilyovska threatened...

01:29:25.496 --> 01:29:28.865
to write what I was doing
to my parents in Meadowville.

01:29:28.999 --> 01:29:30.409
Meadowville?

01:29:32.169 --> 01:29:33.870
Meadowville, Indiana?

01:29:34.421 --> 01:29:39.041
Yes, I'm from there, and I had Miss Hodges
for American history, too.

01:29:40.176 --> 01:29:41.544
Holy smoke!

01:29:41.928 --> 01:29:43.913
Did you hear? She's from Meadowville!

01:29:44.013 --> 01:29:45.923
- No!
- That explains everything.

01:29:50.102 --> 01:29:51.962
- The cops!
- Ivy. You're on.

01:29:52.062 --> 01:29:55.306
- Where am I gonna hide?
- Where have I heard that before?

01:30:02.321 --> 01:30:04.523
Come on. We'll comb the joint.

01:30:30.722 --> 01:30:32.624
You girls see any sailors back here?

01:30:32.724 --> 01:30:35.802
Sailors? Who'd notice a sailor
with you around?

01:30:36.269 --> 01:30:39.055
- Hey, you're pretty cute.
- So are you.

01:30:39.897 --> 01:30:43.684
Get out there. Make with the wiggles.
We gotta sell some tickets.

01:30:49.239 --> 01:30:52.067
Come on. Follow me.
Dance, dance, dance.

01:31:02.210 --> 01:31:03.953
Come on. This way.

01:31:07.047 --> 01:31:07.907
Sing.

01:31:08.007 --> 01:31:10.709
"Pearl of the Persian Sea,

01:31:12.803 --> 01:31:16.673
"When will you come to me?

01:31:18.308 --> 01:31:22.344
"Across the desert sands

01:31:23.479 --> 01:31:26.473
"I wait with outstretched hands

01:31:28.233 --> 01:31:32.312
"Pearl, pearl of ecstasy"

01:31:37.283 --> 01:31:38.693
Wait for me!

01:32:22.158 --> 01:32:23.776
They're all yours.

01:32:27.538 --> 01:32:31.650
I'm taking you girls to night court.
The rest of you stay here for questioning.

01:32:31.750 --> 01:32:32.901
Where are the boys?

01:32:33.001 --> 01:32:35.362
The Shore Patrol
took 'em back to the ship.

01:32:35.462 --> 01:32:37.864
- But they didn't do anything.
- You can't do that.

01:32:37.964 --> 01:32:41.367
- We haven't even said goodbye to them.
- Little one, don't get upset.

01:32:41.467 --> 01:32:44.962
Just a minute. We got a right to know
what the charges are.

01:32:45.471 --> 01:32:48.382
- You want to know what the charges are?
- Yeah.

01:32:48.849 --> 01:32:51.259
Well, first of all, speeding...

01:32:51.768 --> 01:32:54.888
stealing a taxicab,
destroying a dinosaur.

01:32:55.021 --> 01:32:57.674
In general, disturbing the peace
of our fair city.

01:32:57.774 --> 01:33:00.551
For that, you separate three sailors
and their girls...

01:33:00.651 --> 01:33:03.095
without allowing them a goodbye kiss?

01:33:03.195 --> 01:33:07.524
For that, you throw three kids
on a one-day pass in the brig? Speeding.

01:33:07.783 --> 01:33:10.561
Ivy, tell them why we were speeding.

01:33:10.661 --> 01:33:13.480
Well, Gabey thought he'd never
see me again.

01:33:13.580 --> 01:33:14.773
There, there.

01:33:14.873 --> 01:33:16.566
And your dinosaur.

01:33:16.666 --> 01:33:20.236
Why, Professor, you ought to feel proud
about that dinosaur.

01:33:20.336 --> 01:33:23.990
You ought to feel proud that three sailors
from the United States Navy...

01:33:24.090 --> 01:33:26.784
got off the ship for one day,
and what did they do?

01:33:26.884 --> 01:33:30.954
Were they thirsty for hard liquor? No.
They were thirsty for culture.

01:33:31.054 --> 01:33:33.373
Were they running after girls? No.

01:33:33.473 --> 01:33:36.718
They came running to the museum
to see your dinosaur.

01:33:36.851 --> 01:33:40.763
For months out at sea they were dreaming
about your dinosaur.

01:33:40.897 --> 01:33:45.134
Is it any wonder that seeing it face to face,
overcome by emotion...

01:33:45.234 --> 01:33:48.053
that one of them fell against it
and broke it a little?

01:33:48.153 --> 01:33:50.806
I'll bet if that dinosaur could speak,
he'd say...

01:33:50.906 --> 01:33:55.818
what any public-spirited citizen would,
"For the Navy, anytime."

01:33:57.495 --> 01:34:01.524
And the cab. We didn't steal it.
It was my last fare for the day.

01:34:01.624 --> 01:34:06.745
And the biggest fare this cab company
has ever had: $287.50

01:34:07.129 --> 01:34:10.282
And why did I keep this fare all day,
ladies and gentlemen?

01:34:10.382 --> 01:34:13.626
Because I know my duty toward
the servicemen.

01:34:16.388 --> 01:34:17.997
There was this one...

01:34:18.097 --> 01:34:20.591
He was just a little fella.

01:34:21.058 --> 01:34:25.763
A skinny, little runt. He kept pestering me
and following me around.

01:34:26.063 --> 01:34:30.976
I couldn't shake him off. And, finally,
he kind of got under my skin.

01:34:31.735 --> 01:34:33.428
You would have done the same.

01:34:33.528 --> 01:34:37.940
He wanted to see the beautiful sights
of our beautiful city of New York.

01:34:38.575 --> 01:34:40.484
And I showed him plenty.

01:34:40.743 --> 01:34:44.397
And what do you think these boys
think now of our New York hospitality?

01:34:44.497 --> 01:34:46.065
Where's our civic pride?

01:34:46.165 --> 01:34:48.609
We should have hugged them
to our bosoms and said:

01:34:48.709 --> 01:34:51.328
"Boys, the town is yours."

01:34:57.217 --> 01:34:58.993
How about the speeding?

01:34:59.093 --> 01:35:01.704
As a matter of fact,
they weren't doing much over 35.

01:35:01.804 --> 01:35:05.924
- They were crawling at a snail's pace.
- They were practically going backwards.

01:35:07.726 --> 01:35:09.086
Just a minute.

01:35:09.186 --> 01:35:13.715
Folks, it's 5:15, and these kids
have just got time enough...

01:35:13.815 --> 01:35:17.427
to get down to the ship
and say goodbye to the fellas.

01:35:17.527 --> 01:35:21.355
Now, I want to see some action,
and I'm gonna start it.

01:35:21.781 --> 01:35:23.065
Come on.

01:35:27.411 --> 01:35:30.322
"Hooray for the Red, White and Blue

01:35:30.455 --> 01:35:33.033
"Say hooray for the Red, White and Blue"

01:35:40.923 --> 01:35:49.640
"I feel like I'm not out of bed yet

01:36:03.402 --> 01:36:07.180
"The sun is warm

01:36:07.698 --> 01:36:13.018
"But my blanket's warmer

01:36:14.104 --> 01:36:16.080
"Sleep

01:36:16.748 --> 01:36:24.466
"Sleep in your lady's arms"

01:36:26.590 --> 01:36:28.641
Hey, come on!

01:36:46.692 --> 01:36:49.153
- "New York, New York
- New York, New York

01:36:49.253 --> 01:36:51.262
"New York, New York

01:36:51.363 --> 01:36:53.940
"It's a wonderful town

01:36:54.407 --> 01:36:56.859
"New York, New York's
A wonderful town..."

01:36:57.305 --> 01:37:03.301
