00:02.872 --> 00:02.954
(ominous music)

00:43.119 --> 00:45.911
(people shouting)

00:56.424 --> 00:57.256
- Gareth?

00:57.300 --> 01:00.217
(suspenseful music)

01:11.771 --> 01:12.562
Gareth?

01:13.773 --> 01:14.564
Gareth?

01:16.484 --> 01:17.400
I know it's you.

01:17.444 --> 01:19.902
(creepy music)

01:25.076 --> 01:27.242
My call time is in two hours!

01:28.912 --> 01:30.162
What do you think you're doing?

01:30.205 --> 01:33.081
(mysterious music)

01:35.419 --> 01:37.294
I'm not having this
conversation again.

01:37.338 --> 01:38.503
Go on, get out.

01:38.547 --> 01:41.089
(shadowy music)

01:44.470 --> 01:46.594
You're pathetic, you know that?

01:49.724 --> 01:51.474
It was a mutually
beneficial arrangement.

01:51.517 --> 01:52.808
It's business.

01:52.852 --> 01:54.477
You of all people
should've known that.

01:54.520 --> 01:56.979
(wicked music)

02:05.823 --> 02:06.614
Gareth.

02:07.575 --> 02:08.615
(glass shattering)

02:08.658 --> 02:09.407
Gareth!

02:11.703 --> 02:12.535
Gareth!

02:12.579 --> 02:15.205
(dramatic music)

02:16.875 --> 02:17.707
Oh my god.

02:17.751 --> 02:20.668
(menacing music)

02:23.799 --> 02:25.632
I'm sorry, stop!

02:25.675 --> 02:26.591
(Carly sobs)

02:26.635 --> 02:27.926
Stop!

02:27.969 --> 02:30.719
(Carly screams)

02:33.182 --> 02:36.058
(suspicious music)

02:50.950 --> 02:51.614
- [Adrienne] Mr. Baskin,

02:53.326 --> 02:55.660
Hollywood's not standing for
that kind of behavior anymore.

02:55.703 --> 02:58.204
- It's what I do, okay?

02:58.248 --> 03:00.832
I appreciate beautiful things,
beautiful women, you know.

03:02.710 --> 03:05.753
If they got offended,
I promoted them.

03:05.797 --> 03:07.088
That's a win-win, right?

03:07.132 --> 03:08.714
I mean, why can't
we just say that?

03:10.718 --> 03:12.093
- [Adrienne] Because
that's basically just hush.

03:12.137 --> 03:12.884
- Whatever.

03:14.430 --> 03:16.054
(crunching)

03:16.098 --> 03:17.347
Okay.

03:18.851 --> 03:19.975
Why don't we announce a
big donation to Hands Off?

03:21.645 --> 03:23.603
- That's a hash tag.

03:23.647 --> 03:25.147
The foundation is
Speak Out Safe.

03:25.190 --> 03:25.856
- Why don't we launch

03:27.151 --> 03:29.943
an anti sexual harassment
program online?

03:29.987 --> 03:31.153
- They already have one.

03:34.949 --> 03:35.739
- You know what?

03:37.243 --> 03:39.910
I don't hear any good
ideas coming from you.

03:39.954 --> 03:40.703
- All right.

03:42.415 --> 03:43.873
Tell the truth.

03:43.916 --> 03:45.416
Apologize.

03:45.460 --> 03:46.167
- That's a great start.

03:46.210 --> 03:47.126
What else you got?

03:48.379 --> 03:48.419
- Listen, I think
maybe you're looking

03:49.255 --> 03:49.837
for a different perspective.

03:49.881 --> 03:50.838
- Absolutely not.

03:50.882 --> 03:53.174
You, you're perfect.

03:53.217 --> 03:54.758
You're young, you're hungry,

03:54.802 --> 03:55.550
I'll say it,

03:56.678 --> 03:58.553
attractive, you know.

03:58.597 --> 03:59.596
If you fix this,

04:01.016 --> 04:02.640
I'll give you all my PR
work for years to come.

04:02.684 --> 04:03.725
Huh?
- That is a

04:03.768 --> 04:06.269
very generous offer, Mr. Baskin,

04:06.313 --> 04:08.730
but I started my own firm so
that I could choose my clients,

04:08.773 --> 04:10.815
clients that I would
be proud to represent.

04:13.195 --> 04:15.778
- Come on. (laughs)

04:15.822 --> 04:17.279
Don't you feel the rapport
here a little bit, you know?

04:17.323 --> 04:18.780
I mean, the connection?

04:19.783 --> 04:21.783
- No, not really.

04:23.787 --> 04:26.121
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have another meeting.

04:27.416 --> 04:29.708
- All right, how about
I triple your rate?

04:29.752 --> 04:31.710
- It's not always about
money, Mr. Baskin.

04:31.754 --> 04:32.794
- Well you know what?

04:34.548 --> 04:35.964
Your agency's probably gonna
tank in the next month anyway.

04:36.008 --> 04:36.798
Loser.

04:39.761 --> 04:40.468
- [Mina] Where's mommy?

04:41.846 --> 04:43.137
- [Adrienne] Oh Mina,
you know where she is.

04:43.181 --> 04:44.013
- [Mina] The gallery.

04:45.141 --> 04:45.681
- [Adrienne] Anyway,
how was school?

04:45.725 --> 04:46.849
- [Mina] Bad.

04:46.893 --> 04:47.725
- [Adrienne] Aw,
honey, why's that?

04:49.354 --> 04:50.728
- Juan didn't choose me for
his soccer team at lunch!

04:50.772 --> 04:52.563
Are boys always jerks?

04:52.607 --> 04:53.648
- No!

04:54.984 --> 04:57.193
Sometimes they grow
up to be idiots.

04:57.237 --> 04:58.694
(Mina laughs)

04:58.738 --> 05:01.321
- Auntie Adrienne, why
can't I go to mom's show?

05:01.365 --> 05:03.323
I've been so good.

05:03.367 --> 05:06.076
- Oh honey, it's got
nothing to do with that.

05:06.119 --> 05:07.118
You're perfect.

05:08.580 --> 05:09.955
Trust me, it's just gonna
be a bunch of old people

05:09.998 --> 05:12.332
standing around doing
boring old people stuff.

05:12.376 --> 05:13.875
- I don't care.

05:13.919 --> 05:14.543
I want to go.

05:15.420 --> 05:17.087
And anyways, you're not old.

05:17.130 --> 05:19.130
- I put the whole
thing together.

05:19.174 --> 05:20.632
I have to support her, you know.

05:23.803 --> 05:24.510
- [Mina] I guess.

05:26.222 --> 05:28.889
- But I have hired the best
caterers in the entire city,

05:28.933 --> 05:31.892
and they make these
amazing mini cheesecakes.

05:31.936 --> 05:34.019
I'm gonna bring you home more
than you can eat in a week.

05:34.063 --> 05:35.563
No, in a month.

05:35.606 --> 05:36.814
- Or a year!

05:36.857 --> 05:37.940
- Done!

05:37.984 --> 05:40.734
- You're the best aunt ever!

05:40.778 --> 05:42.735
- I kind of am, aren't I?

05:42.779 --> 05:46.614
(Mina and Adrienne laughing)

05:48.827 --> 05:51.786
- [Ramona] Mm mm, darling,
this is a fantastic opening

05:51.830 --> 05:53.037
you've thrown for Emily,

05:54.666 --> 05:56.541
but what if nobody
buys anything?

05:56.585 --> 05:58.251
Is she gonna be
able to handle it?

05:58.295 --> 06:00.545
She could have
another breakdown.

06:00.589 --> 06:02.672
- [Adrienne] Have a
little faith, Ramona.

06:02.716 --> 06:03.423
Whatever happens,

06:04.925 --> 06:05.465
we'll get through it
together like we always do.

06:06.802 --> 06:07.426
- [Ramona] Well, she
does have your genes.

06:07.469 --> 06:08.635
- Mona, look around.

06:08.679 --> 06:10.387
Everybody loves it.

06:10.431 --> 06:12.139
Oh, meatballs.

06:12.182 --> 06:14.182
No, thank you though.

06:14.226 --> 06:16.977
- Honestly, this
soiree makes me miss

06:17.021 --> 06:18.979
having you work for me.

06:19.023 --> 06:21.023
- Remember that when I come
crawling back for my old job.

06:21.066 --> 06:22.190
- Oh stop it.

06:23.277 --> 06:25.651
You were born to
run your own shop.

06:25.695 --> 06:27.111
- We need to talk.

06:27.155 --> 06:27.862
- Emily, I am so sorry,

06:29.240 --> 06:29.447
but look, it's only
been a couple of hours,

06:30.199 --> 06:30.531
and I have always said,

06:31.492 --> 06:32.867
your work, it's very specific.

06:32.910 --> 06:33.659
- Specific?

06:33.703 --> 06:34.869
- This is all a process.

06:34.912 --> 06:36.621
- Well you should've warned me.

06:36.664 --> 06:37.663
This is your fault.

06:37.707 --> 06:38.623
- Wait a minute, what?

06:41.919 --> 06:42.668
- Gotcha.

06:44.672 --> 06:46.631
I sold my very last piece.

06:46.674 --> 06:47.672
(Ramona and Emily laughing)

06:47.716 --> 06:49.049
- I am going to kill you.

06:49.092 --> 06:50.175
Come here.

06:50.218 --> 06:51.426
Amazing.

06:51.470 --> 06:52.636
- Those two trophy
wives over there

06:52.679 --> 06:54.346
actually got into a bidding war.

06:54.389 --> 06:55.639
- Wow.
- Of course they did.

06:55.682 --> 06:56.640
Congratulations.

06:56.683 --> 06:57.390
- Thank you.

06:58.477 --> 06:58.892
And seriously,
thank you so much.

06:59.603 --> 07:00.685
I mean, this is all you.

07:00.729 --> 07:01.519
- No, stop it.

07:02.939 --> 07:03.688
Go talk to that man over
there with the fedora.

07:03.732 --> 07:05.565
He writes for the Times.

07:05.609 --> 07:06.941
- Seriously, can't you
just let loose with me

07:06.985 --> 07:07.817
one night, please?

07:07.861 --> 07:10.194
- I will, I will,

07:10.237 --> 07:11.737
after you do the
rounds one more time.

07:11.781 --> 07:13.113
Now go.

07:13.157 --> 07:14.615
- Go on, I got this.

07:14.659 --> 07:15.574
- Fine.

07:17.703 --> 07:19.078
(phone dings)

07:19.121 --> 07:21.163
- I deserve this.

07:21.207 --> 07:21.997
- Oh wow.

07:22.958 --> 07:23.749
- What?

07:25.461 --> 07:26.710
- Adrienne, Carly Nicks is dead.

07:26.754 --> 07:29.088
- Oh no no, that's
just an internet rumor.

07:29.131 --> 07:29.755
- No, they've confirmed it.

07:30.965 --> 07:31.255
They found her in
her home, strangled.

07:31.883 --> 07:32.632
- Oh my god, what?

07:32.676 --> 07:33.883
According to who?

07:33.927 --> 07:35.468
- It's on TMI Today.

07:35.512 --> 07:36.177
- [Adrienne] What?

07:37.764 --> 07:39.472
- Carly Nicks was sitting
comfortably on the A list,

07:39.516 --> 07:42.809
with an Oscar nom expected for
her role as a deaf activist,

07:42.852 --> 07:46.521
but early this morning, Carly
Nicks was found strangled

07:46.564 --> 07:48.272
in her home.

07:48.316 --> 07:51.234
What kind of monster
would take the life

07:51.277 --> 07:53.276
of America's sweetheart?

07:53.362 --> 07:54.111
Who?

07:55.030 --> 07:56.780
This guy.

07:56.824 --> 07:59.950
Carly's estranged
hubby, Gareth Nicks,

07:59.993 --> 08:02.828
who is currently playing
the role of an innocent man,

08:02.871 --> 08:04.413
another assured flop.

08:05.708 --> 08:07.874
However, Gareth's
manager, Phil Navarro,

08:07.918 --> 08:12.212
claims he was with the washed-up
has-been the entire night,

08:12.256 --> 08:14.046
to which I say

08:14.090 --> 08:17.675
sure he was, Phil.

08:17.719 --> 08:19.635
This is TMI Today

08:19.679 --> 08:22.680
where too much information
is just enough.

08:25.560 --> 08:26.892
- Are you okay?

08:28.855 --> 08:30.354
- Yeah.

08:30.398 --> 08:31.063
Yeah, of course.

08:32.150 --> 08:33.315
It's just it's
been a long night.

08:36.069 --> 08:38.903
- [Nikki] Carly's estranged
hubby, Gareth Nicks,

08:38.947 --> 08:41.448
whose last two action flicks,

08:41.491 --> 08:44.325
well, flickered out.

08:44.369 --> 08:46.870
However, Gareth's
manager, Phil--

08:46.913 --> 08:48.747
- I can't watch this anymore.

08:48.790 --> 08:49.456
I'm going to bed.

08:50.333 --> 08:50.832
- How could Ramona not know

08:52.169 --> 08:53.168
that you and Gareth
used to date in college?

08:53.211 --> 08:54.669
You're not hiding it that well.

08:54.713 --> 08:56.003
- I need to take this down.

08:56.046 --> 08:57.421
- Ah, sorry.

08:57.465 --> 08:59.298
The internet's forever.

08:59.341 --> 09:00.591
- Ramona would've
just pressured me

09:00.634 --> 09:01.759
to bring him in as a client.

09:02.928 --> 09:04.386
We were young.

09:04.430 --> 09:05.679
It wasn't that serious.

09:05.723 --> 09:07.514
- Uh, excuse me, three
years is serious,

09:07.558 --> 09:09.808
and you were crazy about him.

09:09.852 --> 09:11.643
- How do you even remember?

09:11.687 --> 09:14.188
You were a self-involved
16-year-old.

09:14.231 --> 09:16.148
- Well I'm still self-involved.

09:16.192 --> 09:18.649
Doesn't mean I
don't pay attention.

09:18.693 --> 09:20.193
You broke up with him, right?

09:20.236 --> 09:21.027
- Yeah.

09:23.907 --> 09:25.406
It was that year.

09:26.618 --> 09:28.034
I didn't want him
staying with me

09:28.077 --> 09:29.577
just because he
felt sorry for me.

09:31.873 --> 09:33.664
- Is there something
you're not telling me?

09:34.709 --> 09:35.458
Well Hollywood's a small place.

09:36.628 --> 09:37.460
You guys must've
bumped into each other.

09:38.796 --> 09:40.170
- We saw each other
for coffee a few times.

09:41.048 --> 09:42.714
It was always awkward.

09:42.758 --> 09:44.549
- Why, because you
were scared of him?

09:44.593 --> 09:45.509
- No.

09:45.552 --> 09:48.303
(tentative music)

09:51.183 --> 09:53.350
Because I broke his heart.

10:00.108 --> 10:01.565
Good morning.
- Mm.

10:01.609 --> 10:02.775
- Where's mommy?

10:02.819 --> 10:03.609
- Sleeping.

10:05.363 --> 10:07.905
Did you know that koala bears
are actually really mean?

10:09.242 --> 10:12.576
- Well, cute isn't
always kind, young lady.

10:12.620 --> 10:14.662
- You promised me cheesecake.

10:14.705 --> 10:15.329
- I'll make it up to you.

10:16.791 --> 10:17.289
I will bring you something
home tonight, okay?

10:18.459 --> 10:19.583
- In that case I'd
rather have flan.

10:19.627 --> 10:21.835
- Do you even know what flan is?

10:21.878 --> 10:23.670
- Pudding in the
shape of a turtle.

10:23.713 --> 10:25.630
- (laughs) You are strange.

10:25.674 --> 10:27.841
- So, you know who's
really strange?

10:27.884 --> 10:28.842
- Who?

10:28.885 --> 10:30.051
- Juan.

10:30.095 --> 10:31.636
- Mm.

10:31.680 --> 10:34.013
You kind of like
this Juan, don't you?

10:34.057 --> 10:35.306
- No, gross.

10:35.350 --> 10:36.975
Boys are disgusting!

10:37.018 --> 10:38.518
Plus, I'm way too young.

10:38.562 --> 10:39.686
- Good girl.

10:39.729 --> 10:41.271
Have a good day.

10:41.314 --> 10:42.605
- Don't forget my flan.

10:42.649 --> 10:43.647
- I won't.

10:45.860 --> 10:47.734
- [Nikki] Gareth Nicks,
still a person of interest,

10:47.778 --> 10:49.403
seems to be laying low lately.

10:49.446 --> 10:51.905
Hm, why could that be?

10:51.949 --> 10:54.616
Stay tuned, because this'll
only get juicier, people.

10:56.787 --> 10:57.995
- Ugh, that was my turn.

11:01.542 --> 11:02.666
Hey.

11:02.710 --> 11:04.418
- It's incredible.

11:04.461 --> 11:05.459
- [Adrienne] What is?

11:06.796 --> 11:09.589
- That Gareth Nicks could do it.

11:09.632 --> 11:11.674
- Hey, let's, let's
talk about you

11:11.718 --> 11:13.676
and why you're thinking
of changing PR firms.

11:13.720 --> 11:16.220
- You don't actually
buy his alibi, do you?

11:16.264 --> 11:19.140
- Well I don't have any reason
to believe that he's lying.

11:20.184 --> 11:21.893
- Phil Navarro.

11:21.936 --> 11:24.478
You know he pretended to be
from Texas for a whole month

11:24.522 --> 11:26.646
when he was trying to sign me?

11:26.690 --> 11:27.397
- Did he?

11:27.441 --> 11:28.940
- Yeah.

11:28.984 --> 11:30.817
- Well, look.

11:30.861 --> 11:33.320
I think that I could
be a huge asset to you.

11:33.363 --> 11:35.196
Now you would be my
first country music star,

11:35.240 --> 11:36.114
but regardless--

11:36.158 --> 11:36.865
- Do you have any snacks?

11:38.035 --> 11:38.450
I'm sorry, I'm not
trying to be rude.

11:39.578 --> 11:40.577
It's just I'm coming
off this cleanse

11:41.955 --> 11:43.663
and I feel like my whole
body is eating itself.

11:47.501 --> 11:49.335
- I had some peanuts, but...

11:52.340 --> 11:53.714
I will see what I can find.

11:56.177 --> 11:57.176
I'll be right back.

11:57.219 --> 11:57.968
- Thanks.

you've reached the offices

12:24.955 --> 12:26.371
of Adrienne Kleiner.

12:26.414 --> 12:27.580
Please leave a message
and I'll get back to you

12:27.624 --> 12:29.207
as soon as possible.

12:29.250 --> 12:30.749
Thank you.

12:30.793 --> 12:31.541
- Adrienne!

12:32.544 --> 12:33.794
Phil Navarro.

12:33.837 --> 12:34.711
We need to talk.

12:35.965 --> 12:37.339
In person if we can.

12:38.425 --> 12:39.174
It's urgent.

12:40.719 --> 12:42.344
It's about Gareth Nicks.

12:43.764 --> 12:44.554
Thanks.

12:48.978 --> 12:51.687
(majestic music)

13:14.835 --> 13:18.336
(moves into eerie music)

13:39.191 --> 13:40.107
Hey!

13:40.151 --> 13:42.192
(sharp thudding)

13:42.236 --> 13:44.862
(dramatic music)

13:46.866 --> 13:49.658

14:02.130 --> 14:05.131
(suspenseful music)

14:38.999 --> 14:41.707
(Adrienne gasps)

14:44.879 --> 14:45.711
- Gareth?

14:47.298 --> 14:48.089
What?

14:48.132 --> 14:49.465
- Yeah.

14:49.509 --> 14:50.883
How'd you recognize me?

14:50.927 --> 14:52.802
- You have worn
that exact outfit

14:52.845 --> 14:54.804
in like the last
four of your films.

14:54.847 --> 14:56.388
- Oh, so you watch my movies?

14:56.432 --> 14:57.640
- Gareth, honestly,
I'm exhausted.

14:57.683 --> 14:58.557
- No no, I'm sorry.

14:59.727 --> 14:59.809
Listen, I'm sorry
about the whole...

15:01.353 --> 15:01.518
I was just, I was just
waiting for you to get home

15:02.896 --> 15:03.603
and, and then you did
and I froze, you know.

15:04.689 --> 15:06.272
- That was really creepy.

15:06.316 --> 15:08.525
- That's not the impression
I wanted to make after

15:09.528 --> 15:10.568
that many years.

15:12.322 --> 15:13.321
- Why are you here?

15:15.075 --> 15:15.990
- Well actually my manager was
gonna call, you know, Phil,

15:17.702 --> 15:18.952
but, uh, I think it'd be better
if we talked face to face.

15:23.499 --> 15:24.456
You know, I'm sorry.

15:25.417 --> 15:26.333
I should go.

15:28.003 --> 15:29.169
- Gareth, do you realize that
every tabloid in Hollywood

15:29.213 --> 15:30.796
is hunting for you right now?

15:30.840 --> 15:32.506
You can't be out like this.

15:32.550 --> 15:34.716
- (laughs) Yeah, hence my lame

15:34.760 --> 15:36.718
and completely useless disguise.

15:36.762 --> 15:38.303
- Gareth.

15:38.347 --> 15:39.179
- Five minutes.

15:39.932 --> 15:41.557
Please.

15:41.600 --> 15:42.516
It's important.

15:48.523 --> 15:49.564
- Five minutes.

15:51.693 --> 15:53.734
Go around the back.

15:53.778 --> 15:55.611
I don't want you waking
up my sister and niece.

15:58.575 --> 16:00.199
Come on, Gareth.

16:00.243 --> 16:01.826
You know everyone
is gonna expect

16:01.870 --> 16:03.119
your manager to lie for you.

16:03.163 --> 16:04.787
- Exactly.

16:04.831 --> 16:07.747
In the court of public
opinion, I'm already convicted.

16:07.791 --> 16:11.168
I need a solid PR campaign
to revise the narrative.

16:11.211 --> 16:12.544
- Oh no, no.

16:12.588 --> 16:14.713
Gareth, please, don't.

16:16.592 --> 16:17.424
Well,

16:19.011 --> 16:21.553
look, if I do choose
to represent you,

16:21.597 --> 16:23.346
and that is a big if,

16:24.224 --> 16:26.308
you need to level with me.

16:26.351 --> 16:27.683
- Do you need me
to pinky promise?

16:27.727 --> 16:28.475
- Don't.

16:28.519 --> 16:29.310
Look.

16:30.271 --> 16:30.811
I am never gonna lie for you.

16:32.857 --> 16:37.443
All I do is tell the truth so
that it is fully understood.

16:37.486 --> 16:38.277
- Deal.

16:44.160 --> 16:46.285
- All right, let's start again.

16:46.329 --> 16:47.620
Why are you here?

16:48.788 --> 16:50.747
- Because no one else
will return my calls.

16:52.417 --> 16:53.124
- That's honest.

16:54.085 --> 16:54.709
- I didn't kill her, Adrienne.

16:56.296 --> 16:58.254
You know me, and you know
I'm telling you the truth.

16:59.716 --> 17:00.548
I need you.

17:05.388 --> 17:06.054
- [Emily] I have coffee ready.

17:07.224 --> 17:08.139
Now tell me what
happened with Gareth.

17:09.266 --> 17:10.474
- [Adrienne] Just a minute.

17:12.061 --> 17:14.311
- Did he lose it when
you told him to get out?

17:16.523 --> 17:18.607
Wait, you don't think
he's innocent, do you?

17:20.569 --> 17:23.320
- Yeah, I believe that you're
innocent until proven guilty.

17:23.364 --> 17:25.030
- Didn't you start your own firm

17:25.074 --> 17:27.199
so you'd never have
to work with creeps?

17:27.243 --> 17:28.283
- Among other things.

17:28.327 --> 17:29.534
- So, okay, why?

17:30.870 --> 17:32.995
Are you still hung up
on him or something?

17:33.039 --> 17:33.746
- Please.

17:34.707 --> 17:34.872
- Well it's not like you've had

17:36.459 --> 17:37.291
a slough of serious boyfriends
since you guys broke up.

17:37.335 --> 17:38.834
- Maybe I don't want a slough.

17:38.878 --> 17:40.836
- Oh you don't
even date anymore.

17:40.880 --> 17:42.004
- Why would I have
the time to date?

17:43.466 --> 17:44.257
I barely have time to
have dinner with you guys.

17:44.300 --> 17:45.716
- Yeah, that's a choice.

17:45.760 --> 17:47.927
- Yeah, it's me choosing
to pay our mortgage, Em.

17:49.097 --> 17:51.514
- Yeah, and what would
I know about that?

17:56.645 --> 17:57.435
- I'm sorry.

17:58.689 --> 17:59.562
I don't want to fight.

18:00.649 --> 18:02.649
I get it, you're
worried about me.

18:03.610 --> 18:04.609
I know.

18:06.947 --> 18:08.154
- People change, sis.

18:08.198 --> 18:09.072
- Not that much.

18:09.116 --> 18:10.448
- Well I did.

18:12.828 --> 18:15.411
Or do you still think I'm
about to fall apart again?

18:16.372 --> 18:17.579
- No.

18:17.623 --> 18:18.956
No, absolutely not.

18:20.251 --> 18:22.668
Just like you needed
me to believe in you,

18:24.755 --> 18:26.171
I'm choosing to believe in him.

18:29.719 --> 18:30.551
And he needs me.

18:43.940 --> 18:44.230
- [Assistant] Phil
Navarro Talent Management.

18:45.650 --> 18:46.899

Kleiner for Phil Navarro.

18:46.943 --> 18:47.942
- [Assistant] Hi, Miss Kleiner.

18:47.986 --> 18:49.027
- He left a message?

18:50.613 --> 18:51.070
- [Assistant] Yes, Mr.
Navarro's expecting your call.

18:52.032 --> 18:52.697
He's working from home today.

18:52.741 --> 18:54.449
- Right.

18:54.492 --> 18:56.575
- [Assistant] Okay, let
me get an address for you

18:56.618 --> 18:57.743

18:57.786 --> 18:58.493

- Uh, just leave word that
I'm gonna drop by at 3:00.

19:02.082 --> 19:03.749
Have him call me if
that's a problem.

19:34.447 --> 19:35.738
It's Adrienne Kleiner.

19:35.782 --> 19:37.656
I'm sorry, I was here
a little bit early.

19:37.700 --> 19:38.574
I just thought...

19:39.826 --> 19:40.825
(Adrienne gasps)

19:40.869 --> 19:44.204
(terror-stricken music)

be all, Miss Kleiner.

20:04.308 --> 20:05.849
- Thank you for your statement.

20:07.603 --> 20:08.852
- Can I go?

20:08.896 --> 20:10.020
- Of course, of course.

20:10.898 --> 20:12.815
Um, we'll, we'll call you

20:12.858 --> 20:16.026
if we have anymore
questions, all right?

20:17.780 --> 20:19.571
Everything okay?

20:19.615 --> 20:20.406
- Yeah.

20:20.449 --> 20:22.990
(worried music)

20:36.756 --> 20:38.131
- Adrienne, wait up.

20:39.509 --> 20:40.758
Are you all right?

20:40.802 --> 20:41.509
How did you get away?

20:41.553 --> 20:42.718
Did he hurt you?

20:42.762 --> 20:43.594
- What?

20:43.638 --> 20:46.304
No, I just found him.

20:46.348 --> 20:47.722
How are you even here?

20:47.766 --> 20:49.141
- I have my sources.

20:49.184 --> 20:49.850
Lots of them.

20:51.186 --> 20:52.269
Word is he was desperate
to talk to you.

20:52.312 --> 20:53.103
Why?

20:53.147 --> 20:53.937
- No comment.

20:53.981 --> 20:56.982
- Look, I can play nice.

20:57.025 --> 20:58.733
Okay, I know your reputation.

20:58.777 --> 21:00.902
I know you're one
of the good ones,

21:00.946 --> 21:04.948
which is why we're gonna
pretend you were never here.

21:04.992 --> 21:05.781
- Thank you.

21:07.243 --> 21:10.661
- As long as you
drop Gareth Nicks.

21:10.705 --> 21:12.621
I'm making it my
business to sink him

21:12.665 --> 21:14.957
and anyone who helps him.

21:15.001 --> 21:16.167
Understand?

21:16.210 --> 21:18.252
- What has he ever done to you?

21:18.296 --> 21:19.420
- Nothing.

21:19.464 --> 21:20.504
This is Hollywood, honey.

21:20.548 --> 21:21.630
He's ratings gold.

21:21.674 --> 21:23.591
And don't pretend.

21:23.634 --> 21:25.926
You're in the game
just like I am.

21:27.554 --> 21:28.845
- I may be nice,

21:29.806 --> 21:31.681
but I do not scare easily.

21:31.725 --> 21:35.602
- (laughs) That's only because
I haven't said boo yet.

21:35.645 --> 21:38.730
(unfriendly music)

21:43.737 --> 21:45.778
- [Adrienne] I have
got nothing to hide.

21:45.822 --> 21:48.906
- One segment about Adrienne
Kleiner the killer lover

21:48.949 --> 21:51.700
and your life becomes
very complicated.

21:51.744 --> 21:53.702
- No, Gareth has an alibi.

21:56.040 --> 21:56.830
Had one.

21:56.874 --> 21:58.707
- Exactly.

21:58.751 --> 21:59.583
You know, maybe
Phil knew the truth

22:01.253 --> 22:02.544
and Gareth didn't think that
he could keep a secret, so--

22:02.588 --> 22:03.378
- Maybe.

22:05.424 --> 22:07.466
No, maybe not!

22:07.510 --> 22:10.218
- Regardless, this doesn't
bode well for anyone,

22:10.261 --> 22:11.552
you especially.

22:11.596 --> 22:12.512
- Ramona, come on!

22:13.848 --> 22:14.597
You have repped way
worse people than this.

22:15.934 --> 22:18.017
- Yes, and I had the
funds to defend myself

22:18.061 --> 22:20.561
if the story became about me.

22:20.605 --> 22:21.729
- Point taken.
- Yeah.

22:23.483 --> 22:26.234
Look, if you have to do this,

22:26.277 --> 22:27.818
just promise me
you'll be discrete.

22:29.531 --> 22:30.571
- I'm well aware
of the potential--

22:30.615 --> 22:32.489

22:32.533 --> 22:33.698
That's a voice mail.

22:38.789 --> 22:40.789
I'm actually at your office.

22:40.832 --> 22:42.457
I need to talk to
you about Gareth.

22:43.585 --> 22:45.168
- What's going on?

22:45.212 --> 22:46.795
- Someone's just
shown up at my office.

22:46.838 --> 22:48.880
They have information
about Gareth.

22:48.924 --> 22:51.091
- And the plot thickens.

22:51.134 --> 22:52.259
- I'll talk to you later.

22:53.636 --> 22:54.718
- Hey, be careful.

22:54.762 --> 22:57.638
(foreboding music)

23:07.024 --> 23:08.524
- Hi, I'm Ian.

23:12.029 --> 23:13.654
So you're the one that got away.

23:15.574 --> 23:16.364
- Excuse me?

23:18.493 --> 23:20.535
- Gareth, that's what he
always used to say about you.

23:23.498 --> 23:25.206
- Are you sure he
was talking about me?

23:25.292 --> 23:26.708
- Oh, 100%.

23:26.751 --> 23:28.209
You look even
prettier in person.

23:30.505 --> 23:31.588
- Wow.

23:34.217 --> 23:35.507
Thank you.

23:35.551 --> 23:37.759
Um, okay, wow.

23:37.803 --> 23:38.885
Please, take a seat.

23:38.929 --> 23:40.679
- Oh, yeah.

23:40.723 --> 23:42.764
- Tell me, how do
you know Gareth?

23:42.808 --> 23:44.141
- Yeah, ah.

23:44.184 --> 23:45.517
Sorry.

23:45.561 --> 23:48.687
Um, so I've, I've
known Gareth for years.

23:48.731 --> 23:51.815
I've, I've been his
stunt double, uh,

23:52.985 --> 23:54.610
- Whoa, that is quite a while.

23:54.653 --> 23:55.819
- Yeah.

23:55.863 --> 23:58.154
Yeah, it's been a long time,

23:58.197 --> 24:00.531
long enough for me to
know that, you know,

24:00.575 --> 24:03.701
Gareth would never harm Carly.

24:06.205 --> 24:07.204
- Yeah, I know.

24:12.045 --> 24:12.793
How would you feel about

24:13.921 --> 24:15.713
talking to Nikki
Leone about Gareth?

24:15.757 --> 24:17.214
- Who is she?

24:17.258 --> 24:18.049
- Really?

24:19.092 --> 24:19.883
- What?

24:20.719 --> 24:21.593
- Never mind.

24:23.680 --> 24:25.347
She's the host of TMI Today.

24:25.390 --> 24:27.265
It's a celebrity gossip show.

24:27.309 --> 24:30.727
She has made it her mission
in life to bury Gareth.

24:30.771 --> 24:32.354
- Why?

24:32.397 --> 24:33.647
- You don't want to know.

24:35.400 --> 24:37.067
How about you just say to her
basically what you told me,

24:37.110 --> 24:40.861
that Gareth was nothing
but kind to Carly?

24:40.905 --> 24:41.612
Let's just stress that

24:42.948 --> 24:44.448
Gareth really wanted
to get back with Carly,

24:44.492 --> 24:47.117
but not in a stalkery way,
if you know what I mean.

24:48.120 --> 24:49.286
- Yeah.

24:49.330 --> 24:50.663
- Yeah?
- Yeah, no.

24:50.706 --> 24:51.622
Yeah, I can do that.

24:52.541 --> 24:53.582
- Great.

24:53.626 --> 24:54.500
Okay.

24:54.543 --> 24:55.668
Thank you.

24:55.711 --> 24:56.585
- It was great.

24:56.629 --> 24:58.420
Really great meeting you.

24:58.464 --> 24:59.380
- You too.

24:59.423 --> 25:02.090
(touching music)

25:09.683 --> 25:10.682
Bye.

25:10.725 --> 25:11.641
- [Ian] Bye.

25:11.685 --> 25:16.479
(ponderous music)

25:21.695 --> 25:24.486
(phone vibrating)

25:35.916 --> 25:40.252
- Turns out Gareth and Carly
were headed for splitsville,

25:40.295 --> 25:42.754
and a source close
to the washed-up star

25:42.798 --> 25:45.631
told me that Gareth
was heartbroken

25:45.675 --> 25:49.635
and ready to do anything
to make her stay.

25:49.679 --> 25:53.723
And now enraged die-hard
Carly Nicks fans

25:53.766 --> 25:55.057
have stormed his home.

25:56.060 --> 25:58.227
How did they know
where he lived?

25:58.271 --> 25:59.979
This girl isn't telling.

26:01.149 --> 26:03.065
Gareth, darling,

26:04.193 --> 26:05.942
you probably should
just fess up.

26:07.154 --> 26:10.196
He'd be much safer
in a prison cell.

26:10.240 --> 26:13.408
This is TMI Today where
too much information--

26:13.452 --> 26:15.618
- No, what have I done?

26:15.662 --> 26:16.870
- [Emily] What have you done?

26:18.081 --> 26:18.955
- [Adrienne] I sent
Ian to tell Nikki

26:20.542 --> 26:21.207
that Gareth wanted to get
back together with Carly.

26:21.251 --> 26:22.041
- Right.

26:23.003 --> 26:25.545
- And now I've made it worse!

26:25.589 --> 26:26.838
Much worse!

26:27.715 --> 26:31.383
- Well, maybe this was a sign.

26:32.803 --> 26:34.511
- What do you mean?

26:34.555 --> 26:36.263
- That taking on
Gareth was a mistake.

26:39.435 --> 26:40.642
- Oh, man.

26:40.686 --> 26:43.228
(ominous music)

26:49.027 --> 26:51.694
(drill whirring)

27:19.598 --> 27:20.472
Gareth?

27:23.977 --> 27:24.768
- Hey.

27:24.812 --> 27:25.602
- Hey.

27:28.023 --> 27:29.731
Isn't that Gareth's car?

27:29.775 --> 27:31.857
- Actually, Gareth caught
me eyeing his on set,

27:31.901 --> 27:32.775
and the next day I rolled up

27:34.111 --> 27:34.568
and that was parked
in front of my trailer

27:35.446 --> 27:35.986
with a giant bow around it.

27:36.030 --> 27:37.404
- What?

27:37.490 --> 27:38.489
Wow.

27:39.826 --> 27:40.699
Next time you should
compliment his house.

27:42.703 --> 27:44.328
How do you know where I live?

27:44.372 --> 27:45.120
- Gareth.

27:47.875 --> 27:49.375
- Not entirely appropriate.

27:49.418 --> 27:50.876
- Uh, no, please, don't be mad.

27:50.920 --> 27:52.795
I just wanted to
apologize in person

27:52.839 --> 27:55.380
because I think I got a little
nervous during that interview

27:55.423 --> 27:56.756
and I may have said
the wrong thing.

27:56.800 --> 27:58.341
- Oh no, you did nothing wrong.

27:58.385 --> 27:59.175
It was my idea.

27:59.219 --> 28:01.052
My bad idea.

28:01.096 --> 28:04.180
- No, that, that's
not true at all.

28:04.224 --> 28:05.473
- I don't know.

28:07.102 --> 28:09.018
Maybe I'm just not as good
at this as I thought I was.

28:09.062 --> 28:09.686
- All right, you know what?

28:10.772 --> 28:11.855
I think someone
needs a pep talk.

28:11.898 --> 28:13.189
How about I take
you out to dinner?

28:14.608 --> 28:15.732
- I would love that.

28:17.236 --> 28:20.195
But I really have to
put out this fire first.

28:20.239 --> 28:22.406
But you're welcome to
come in for coffee.

28:22.449 --> 28:24.616
- Uh, uh, you know what?

28:24.660 --> 28:27.661
I'm, I got myself in
enough trouble already.

28:27.705 --> 28:29.121
How about just give me a ring
if you need anything, okay?

28:29.164 --> 28:29.955
- Yeah.

28:31.667 --> 28:32.749
See ya.

28:32.793 --> 28:33.542
- [Ian] All right, bye.

28:33.586 --> 28:36.586
(perplexed music)

28:47.557 --> 28:48.639
- God.

28:50.476 --> 28:51.976
Gareth, you could
get a gardener.

28:52.937 --> 28:53.769
Shit.

28:54.606 --> 28:55.521
Oh man.

28:55.565 --> 28:58.565
(uncertain music)

28:59.860 --> 29:01.192
Oh, wow.

29:05.115 --> 29:05.989
All right.

29:06.033 --> 29:08.783
(crowd screaming)

29:24.884 --> 29:26.550
- [Gareth] It's about time.

29:26.594 --> 29:27.801
- Oh jeez.

29:29.305 --> 29:30.721
Yeah, well it's not easy
walking like a mile uphill

29:30.765 --> 29:31.931
to sneak around back.

29:31.974 --> 29:32.598
- Well I didn't want you to wade

29:33.517 --> 29:34.308
through the crazies out front.

29:35.269 --> 29:35.976
Let's talk inside.

29:37.647 --> 29:38.187
Somebody was flying a drone
an hour ago and woke me up.

29:38.230 --> 29:38.938
- What?

29:38.981 --> 29:39.688
Woke you up?

29:40.649 --> 29:41.105
It's like 1:00 in the afternoon.

29:42.233 --> 29:42.607
- Yeah, what's there
to wake up for?

29:45.946 --> 29:46.611
I don't understand.

29:47.739 --> 29:48.613
- I lined up another
PR firm for you,

29:48.657 --> 29:49.614
which I have hand-selected.

29:49.658 --> 29:50.782
- Of course you have.

29:50.825 --> 29:52.283
- They deal with
major corporations

29:52.327 --> 29:54.535
facing nasty public lawsuits.

29:54.579 --> 29:55.328
- Oh, like when a
chemical company

29:55.372 --> 29:56.287
gives a whole town asthma.

29:56.331 --> 29:57.121
Great.

29:59.459 --> 30:00.750
- I am out of my
depth here, Gareth.

30:00.794 --> 30:02.542
- Or you just want
off a sinking ship

30:02.586 --> 30:03.835
that could tarnish your
stellar reputation.

30:03.879 --> 30:05.462
- Gareth, I tried.

30:06.632 --> 30:08.215
- You tried?

30:08.258 --> 30:08.924
That's Adrienne, folks.

30:08.968 --> 30:09.800
She tries.

30:09.843 --> 30:11.343
Give her a gold star.

30:11.387 --> 30:12.844
(glass shatters)
(Adrienne gasps)

30:12.888 --> 30:15.639
(malicious music)

30:17.059 --> 30:17.808
You didn't deserve that.

30:17.851 --> 30:20.268
I'm sorry, it's...

30:20.312 --> 30:22.354
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

30:22.398 --> 30:23.688
I just, I just,

30:23.731 --> 30:24.689
I haven't been sleeping.

30:24.732 --> 30:26.691
I, I'm stuck in my own house.

30:26.734 --> 30:27.733
I'm going a little nuts.

30:29.654 --> 30:32.196
I know you're doing
everything you can.

30:32.240 --> 30:33.322
Hey!

30:33.366 --> 30:34.156
Hey!

30:34.200 --> 30:35.616
Get off my property!

30:35.660 --> 30:37.076
That's it, cops said
they couldn't do anything

30:37.120 --> 30:38.536
until they trespassed
on my property.

30:38.579 --> 30:39.245
Where's my phone?

30:40.164 --> 30:40.413
- You don't have a landline?

30:40.957 --> 30:41.455
- What am I, 80?

30:42.291 --> 30:42.498
I'm gonna check upstairs.

30:43.251 --> 30:43.290
Can you check my car?

30:44.419 --> 30:44.542
It's in the garage,
it's unlocked.

30:47.629 --> 30:48.712
- Sure.

30:58.390 --> 30:59.806
(locks clicking)

30:59.850 --> 31:02.267
(engine cranks)

31:02.352 --> 31:03.184
Weird.

31:03.228 --> 31:05.562
(eerie music)

31:15.990 --> 31:16.822
Gareth!

31:18.200 --> 31:20.534
(Adrienne sniffs)

31:20.578 --> 31:22.786
(Adrienne coughs)

31:22.872 --> 31:23.620
God!

31:26.042 --> 31:27.082
Gareth!

31:27.126 --> 31:29.459
(labored breathing)

31:29.502 --> 31:30.543
Gareth!

31:32.422 --> 31:33.713
Oh god!

31:33.757 --> 31:35.715
(labored breathing)

31:35.759 --> 31:36.466
(car horn honks)

31:36.509 --> 31:38.176
Gareth!

31:38.219 --> 31:40.887
(car horn honks)

31:53.859 --> 31:55.650
(Adrienne coughs)

31:55.694 --> 31:56.485
- Okay?

31:57.821 --> 31:58.987
- Where am I?

31:59.031 --> 31:59.821
- You're at my place.

31:59.865 --> 32:02.074
Here, drink this.

32:02.117 --> 32:03.700
- What happened?

32:03.744 --> 32:06.411
- Well, somebody rigged
my car to fill with gas

32:06.455 --> 32:08.413
while simultaneously
locking you inside.

32:09.458 --> 32:10.248
I'm assuming it
was meant for me,

32:11.918 --> 32:12.875
given there's a mob of Carly
Nicks fans on my front lawn

32:12.919 --> 32:13.876
who'd prefer I was dead.

32:15.963 --> 32:17.713
Half the window is
still in my hand.

32:18.841 --> 32:20.925
- Where are the police?

32:20.968 --> 32:22.510
Why am I not in a hospital?

32:22.553 --> 32:24.887
- So I was about to call
911, but you were breathing,

32:24.931 --> 32:26.180
so I decided to--

32:26.224 --> 32:27.181
- I could've died.

32:28.392 --> 32:28.432
- [Gareth] Yeah, but
the internet said

32:29.310 --> 32:29.350
as long as you were breathing

32:30.520 --> 32:30.559
and I could get you out of--
- Really?

32:32.020 --> 32:32.977
You went on WebMD for 10
minutes and you're a doctor now?

32:33.021 --> 32:34.354
- I'm a murderer, Adrienne.

32:37.109 --> 32:38.983
No no no no no.

32:39.027 --> 32:41.152
According to those people
and half the world,

32:41.196 --> 32:42.862
thanks to Nikki
Leone and TMI Today,

32:42.906 --> 32:44.030
I killed my wife.

32:45.909 --> 32:47.575
Do you understand?

32:47.619 --> 32:48.326
What do you think
is gonna happen

32:49.996 --> 32:51.246
when they find out another
woman almost died in my house?

32:53.291 --> 32:54.665
- I get it.

32:54.708 --> 32:55.415
I get it.

32:58.087 --> 32:59.586
- I am sorry.

32:59.630 --> 33:01.880
I am so sorry.

33:01.924 --> 33:04.049
I just, I didn't
know what to do.

33:04.093 --> 33:04.925
You're okay, right?

33:07.930 --> 33:08.762
- Yeah.

33:11.433 --> 33:12.266
Thank you.

33:13.727 --> 33:14.518
- Please.

33:14.562 --> 33:16.978
(gentle music)

33:19.732 --> 33:21.816
And on another
note, you're fired.

33:21.860 --> 33:23.276
I just can't let
something happen to you.

33:23.319 --> 33:25.695
- I quit already, remember?

33:25.738 --> 33:28.573
- You tried to quit,
but now I'm firing you.

33:28.616 --> 33:29.448
- All right then.

33:33.830 --> 33:34.954
What are you gonna do?

33:36.331 --> 33:38.290
I mean, you can't stay here.

33:38.333 --> 33:40.167
- I already booked a
suite at the Rembrandt.

33:40.210 --> 33:41.835
- Which will be fine

33:41.879 --> 33:44.754
until the concierge
calls Nikki Leone.

33:44.798 --> 33:45.630
- Fine, you're rehired.

33:45.674 --> 33:46.423
What do I do?

33:47.593 --> 33:48.425
- Uh,

33:51.013 --> 33:52.345
just stay with me.

33:52.389 --> 33:53.638
- Stay with you?

33:53.682 --> 33:55.432
- Temporarily.

33:55.475 --> 33:58.058
Just until all of
this blows over.

33:58.936 --> 34:00.728
- Doesn't Emily live with you?

34:00.771 --> 34:02.813
- And her daughter, Mina, yeah.

34:04.275 --> 34:06.066
- And you're sure
this is a good idea?

34:07.820 --> 34:09.320
- Don't worry, all right.

34:11.741 --> 34:12.489
It'll be fine.

34:13.826 --> 34:16.035
- [Emily] What the
hell were you thinking?

34:16.078 --> 34:16.952
- [Adrienne] It's temporary!

34:16.996 --> 34:18.037
- Yeah, of course it is,

34:18.080 --> 34:18.746
because any second now

34:20.540 --> 34:20.788
the cops are gonna break down
the door and drag him away!

34:21.750 --> 34:21.789
- He's not safe at his house!

34:22.375 --> 34:22.749
- Not my problem!

34:24.294 --> 34:24.417
- I would never do anything
to jeopardize you two!

34:24.878 --> 34:25.251
- Oh yeah?

34:25.962 --> 34:26.336
Yeah, well you just did!

34:27.088 --> 34:27.420
- He's staying, Emily!

34:28.048 --> 34:28.213
This is my house!

34:29.382 --> 34:30.423
- Oh yeah, thanks
for the reminder.

34:30.467 --> 34:31.466
- Hey Emily.

34:31.509 --> 34:32.258
- Really?

34:33.762 --> 34:34.552
- Been a while.

34:35.639 --> 34:37.055
- Look, Gareth, I just really--

34:37.098 --> 34:38.932
- Look, I thought it
was a terrible idea too,

34:38.975 --> 34:40.933
but your sister wouldn't budge.

34:40.976 --> 34:42.476
- What happened to your hand?

34:44.230 --> 34:44.978
- Nothing.

34:45.940 --> 34:45.979
I just cut it making a sandwich.

34:46.607 --> 34:47.731
Not very eventful.

34:49.443 --> 34:50.234
- Yeah, I bet.

34:51.403 --> 34:54.154
I, I, I can't, I gotta go.

34:56.867 --> 34:58.033
- [Mina] Is mommy mad?

34:58.953 --> 35:00.577
- No, she'll be fine, sweetie.

35:02.372 --> 35:03.829
I promise.

35:03.873 --> 35:05.539
- Okay.

35:05.583 --> 35:08.125
He's Rolo, did you know?

35:08.169 --> 35:10.795
- I didn't think anyone
actually saw that movie.

35:10.838 --> 35:12.964
- The wizard that
moved to the suburbs?

35:13.007 --> 35:15.633
Yeah, it's in, what,
like your top five?

35:15.677 --> 35:16.425
- My top one.

35:17.804 --> 35:19.929
- Oh, number one.

35:19.973 --> 35:20.680
- Mm.

35:21.641 --> 35:21.722
- Hey Mina, how would you feel

35:22.809 --> 35:23.266
if Rolo stayed
with us for a bit?

35:23.309 --> 35:24.057
- Really?

35:24.851 --> 35:26.643
- Yeah, you bet.

35:26.687 --> 35:27.394
- Yes!

35:28.230 --> 35:28.853
Want to come see my room?

35:29.690 --> 35:30.939
- Uh, I don't know, can I?

35:32.192 --> 35:34.901
Or is it so messy I'll
need a cleaning spell?

35:34.945 --> 35:38.321
- (laughs) A cleaning
spell, those don't exist.

35:40.450 --> 35:41.866
Okay, I'll go clean my room.

35:43.620 --> 35:45.744
(Gareth laughs)

35:45.788 --> 35:46.537
- Well done.

35:48.082 --> 35:51.000
- Hey, how about I make
dinner for you guys tonight?

35:51.043 --> 35:53.836
My carbonara might even
thaw out your sister.

35:53.879 --> 35:56.171
- Sure, but I've got plans.

35:56.215 --> 35:57.256
- Do you?

35:57.300 --> 35:58.090
- Yeah.

35:59.552 --> 36:00.384
You know the guy.

36:02.305 --> 36:03.304
Ian.

36:03.347 --> 36:04.805
- Ian?

36:04.849 --> 36:06.515
Coulter?

36:06.558 --> 36:07.265
Really?

36:08.101 --> 36:08.641
- What, you got an issue?

36:09.811 --> 36:11.060
- No no no no no,
he's a solid guy.

36:12.772 --> 36:14.981
He's a magician when it comes
to cars, guns, and stunts.

36:15.025 --> 36:16.441
- Oh cool, I'll
keep that in mind

36:16.484 --> 36:18.776
next time I need help
busting through a window.

36:22.991 --> 36:24.157
Why don't you try and
whip up that pasta

36:24.200 --> 36:25.199
and win over my sister?

36:25.243 --> 36:26.993
- Oh, all right, no pressure.

36:27.037 --> 36:29.411
- Oh come on, you're an actor.

36:29.455 --> 36:31.163
Just pretend to be someone

36:31.206 --> 36:32.873
she doesn't want to
kick out of the house.

36:32.916 --> 36:37.753
(Gareth laughs)
(affectionate music)

36:40.007 --> 36:42.257
(moves into misty music)

36:42.301 --> 36:45.552
(knocking on the door)

36:55.855 --> 36:56.979
Hey.

36:57.023 --> 36:58.981
- Oh, I, uh, got you something.

36:59.025 --> 36:59.940
- Aw, thank you.

36:59.984 --> 37:00.733
They're beautiful.

37:00.777 --> 37:01.525
- [Ian] Thanks.

37:02.904 --> 37:04.779
- Hey, I just have
to go get my purse.

37:04.822 --> 37:05.821
Can you wait here one sec?

37:05.865 --> 37:06.989
- [Ian] Yes.

37:07.033 --> 37:07.698
- Okay, I'll be right back.

37:07.742 --> 37:08.491
- Okay.
- Okay.

37:12.829 --> 37:15.080
- Here we go.
- I want a lot.

37:15.123 --> 37:16.456
- [Gareth] Okay,
here we go, a lot.

37:16.500 --> 37:17.874
Are you ready?

37:17.918 --> 37:19.918
Rolo's magic pasta.

37:19.961 --> 37:22.379
- Whoa.
- That's enough.

37:22.422 --> 37:23.922
- [Mina] More!

37:23.965 --> 37:28.843
(dishes clinking)
(foreboding music)

37:29.763 --> 37:30.804
- Ian!
- Gareth.

37:31.765 --> 37:32.805
- What's going on?

37:32.848 --> 37:34.431
- [Ian] Hey, guys.

37:34.475 --> 37:36.308
- Adrienne is letting
me crash here.

37:36.352 --> 37:38.602
It got a little
weird at my place.

37:38.646 --> 37:40.896
- Oh, you're,
you're staying here?

37:40.940 --> 37:42.523
- Yeah, crazy, huh?

37:42.566 --> 37:43.816
- Yeah, not everyone's
thrilled about it.

37:43.859 --> 37:44.900
- I am.

37:46.404 --> 37:47.945
- Although if everything
you cook tastes like this.

37:47.988 --> 37:48.904
- Better.

37:48.948 --> 37:49.613
- [Emily] Sure.

37:50.783 --> 37:50.906
- Hey, you guys
could always eat in.

37:51.450 --> 37:52.157
I made plenty.

37:52.201 --> 37:53.825
- Uh, that's okay.

37:53.868 --> 37:55.576
I made reservations.

37:55.620 --> 37:56.786
- She made reservations.

37:59.707 --> 38:00.498
- Next time.

38:01.459 --> 38:02.333
- Yeah, for sure.

38:02.377 --> 38:04.043
- Hey, we should catch up.

38:04.087 --> 38:05.461
- It was really good to see you.

38:07.549 --> 38:08.965
- Hey Em, do you mind

38:09.008 --> 38:11.259
putting those flowers
in a vase for me?

38:11.302 --> 38:12.885
- Yeah, sure.

38:12.929 --> 38:14.011
- Thank you.

38:14.055 --> 38:15.512
Bye, guys.

38:15.556 --> 38:16.346
- Enjoy.

38:18.892 --> 38:22.269
- Hey pal, have
her back by 11:00.

38:22.312 --> 38:24.062
- I will be home when I please.

38:24.106 --> 38:25.897
- Oh, (laughs) she's the boss.

38:27.818 --> 38:28.817
- Is there bacon in this?

38:28.861 --> 38:29.776
I love bacon.

38:31.029 --> 38:31.361
- Well then yeah,
there's bacon in it.

38:31.405 --> 38:32.112
- Yes!

38:36.493 --> 38:38.242
- [Ian] Hey, was that awkward?

38:38.286 --> 38:39.326
- No.

38:39.370 --> 38:40.786
No, we're ancient history.

38:42.331 --> 38:44.081
Why, was it
uncomfortable for you?

38:44.125 --> 38:46.959
- No, no, no, not at all.

38:47.003 --> 38:48.210
- I'm sorry, I didn't realize

38:48.254 --> 38:49.795
that you were
gonna come in and--

38:49.839 --> 38:51.839
- We're good, honestly.

38:51.883 --> 38:52.631
- Okay.

38:54.302 --> 38:55.426
- You know, I wanted to take
you somewhere before dinner.

38:55.470 --> 38:56.218
Do we have time?

38:57.263 --> 38:58.303
- Uh, yeah.

38:58.346 --> 39:00.263
Reservations aren't until 8:00.

39:00.307 --> 39:03.183
- All right, but it's, it's
not for the faint of heart.

39:03.226 --> 39:04.684
- Sounds like a challenge.

39:05.896 --> 39:06.686
- You up for it?

39:10.901 --> 39:11.941
- Why not?

39:12.819 --> 39:14.402
- [Ian] Game on.

39:14.446 --> 39:15.778
It's gonna be a good time.

39:16.865 --> 39:17.989
- [Adrienne] Good time, huh?

39:18.033 --> 39:18.698
- [Ian] Mm-hm.

39:19.950 --> 39:20.908
- [Adrienne] Good
time with my stuntman.

39:20.951 --> 39:21.742
- [Ian] Mm-hm.

39:21.785 --> 39:24.620
(foreboding music)

39:28.709 --> 39:29.833
- [Adrienne] What is that?

39:31.295 --> 39:31.960
- [Ian] I've done this a
thousand times, trust me.

39:32.004 --> 39:34.880
(untrusting music)

39:43.556 --> 39:44.388
- Are we almost there?

39:44.432 --> 39:45.431
- Ah!

39:45.475 --> 39:46.265
Mm.

39:47.185 --> 39:48.017
- Hey, are you all right?

39:48.061 --> 39:48.851
- Yeah, no, I'm fine.

39:49.938 --> 39:50.603
It's just 20 years
of stunt work,

39:51.814 --> 39:51.938
that's what it'll
do to you. (laughs)

39:53.316 --> 39:54.857
My knee is practically
titanium at this point.

39:54.901 --> 39:56.943
- Have you seen a specialist?

39:56.986 --> 39:59.320
- After a while they just
prescribe you more painkillers.

39:59.364 --> 40:00.154
I'll live.

40:03.116 --> 40:04.866
Come on, it's just,
it's right over here.

40:04.910 --> 40:07.619
(wondering music)

40:12.834 --> 40:14.417
- It is beautiful.

40:17.214 --> 40:19.005
- Yeah, top of the world.

40:20.968 --> 40:22.259
You know,

40:23.887 --> 40:25.261
I always told Gareth that he
should take Carly up here.

40:25.304 --> 40:26.720
- What, with his
fear of heights?

40:26.764 --> 40:27.429
Uh-uh.
(Ian laughs)

40:28.432 --> 40:28.556
- [Ian] You knew
about that, huh?

40:28.891 --> 40:29.348
- Yeah.

40:30.685 --> 40:31.684
- You know, when he
finished The Dark Cult,

40:31.727 --> 40:33.185
he drove for two straight days

40:33.229 --> 40:35.104
to avoid flying home from set.

40:35.147 --> 40:36.021
- What?

40:37.567 --> 40:39.984
That is even more dangerous,
statistically speaking.

40:40.027 --> 40:41.819
- Carly, she used
to fly everywhere.

40:41.862 --> 40:42.653
It drove him nuts!

40:42.697 --> 40:43.487
- I bet.

40:47.075 --> 40:50.535
- What do you think
happened with her, honestly?

40:50.579 --> 40:51.619
- Some disturbed fan.

40:53.582 --> 40:54.872
- You know, you're
one of the few people

40:54.916 --> 40:55.873
that believe that he's innocent.

40:55.917 --> 40:56.791
Why?

40:58.169 --> 41:00.003
- Because whoever did
that to Carly is evil.

41:00.046 --> 41:01.337
Gareth isn't evil.

41:03.341 --> 41:04.882
- You seem certain about that.

41:05.969 --> 41:06.759
- You know, he
would've stuck by me

41:08.053 --> 41:08.760
during the most
difficult year in my life

41:08.804 --> 41:09.845
if I had let him.

41:12.349 --> 41:13.765
- Yep.

41:13.809 --> 41:14.558
That's Gareth.

41:19.315 --> 41:20.188
- Can I trust you?

41:21.817 --> 41:22.816
- Yes, no, of course.

41:24.486 --> 41:25.944
- Someone is trying to kill him.

41:26.905 --> 41:28.904
- What, who?

41:28.948 --> 41:29.864
- They rigged his car.

41:31.576 --> 41:32.908
They tried to make it look
like he had committed suicide.

41:32.952 --> 41:33.993
- Okay, that's crazy.

41:34.037 --> 41:34.910
- I know, right?

41:36.164 --> 41:36.871
I went into his car
to get his cellphone

41:36.914 --> 41:38.831
and I got trapped inside.

41:38.875 --> 41:40.791
I almost died.

41:40.835 --> 41:41.917
- Okay, maybe it's too dangerous

41:41.961 --> 41:43.044
for you to be around Gareth.

41:43.087 --> 41:44.712
Maybe you just need to--

41:44.756 --> 41:46.964
- Gareth's the only
reason that I'm alive.

41:47.008 --> 41:48.299
He pulled me out.

41:48.343 --> 41:51.301
(questioning music)

41:57.517 --> 41:58.308
What's wrong?

41:59.978 --> 42:00.852
- I'm sorry, it's,

42:02.939 --> 42:05.482
it's just I lost
someone a few years ago,

42:05.525 --> 42:06.566
someone very special.

42:08.487 --> 42:09.527
- I am so sorry.

42:12.865 --> 42:14.490
My mom passed away
when I was 20.

42:16.035 --> 42:18.744
I know it's not the same, but...

42:20.164 --> 42:21.955
- It casts a dark
shadow, don't it?

42:21.999 --> 42:23.957
- It really affected Emily.

42:26.212 --> 42:31.006
She's always had issues, but
it just made it so much worse.

42:31.717 --> 42:32.758
- Drugs?

42:32.801 --> 42:33.841
- No.

42:35.887 --> 42:37.845
Her brain wasn't wired right.

42:39.224 --> 42:42.850
She fought it with
meds, everything.

42:42.894 --> 42:45.895
(sensitive music)

42:47.148 --> 42:48.272
Having Mina helped.

42:52.445 --> 42:56.363
But geez, it has been
a long, difficult road

42:56.407 --> 42:57.906
to get her back on solid ground.

43:00.828 --> 43:01.910
- She's lucky to have you.

43:03.539 --> 43:04.579
- Thank you.

43:05.958 --> 43:07.958
But with everything that
we have been through,

43:12.089 --> 43:13.839
I feel like I'm the lucky one.

43:13.882 --> 43:16.841
(sentimental music)

43:20.972 --> 43:22.263
- Gareth was right about you.

43:26.102 --> 43:27.810
You are the one that got away.

43:27.854 --> 43:30.271
(hushed music)

43:56.715 --> 43:57.756
- Hey.

43:58.632 --> 43:59.381
- [Gareth] Hey.

44:01.135 --> 44:02.801
- How was your night?

44:02.845 --> 44:04.428
- Hey, for old times sake.

44:04.472 --> 44:06.889
- [Adrienne] For old times sake.

44:06.932 --> 44:08.390
So, what have you been up to?

44:11.145 --> 44:12.311
- I've just been sitting here

44:12.354 --> 44:14.688
regretting every
decision I've ever made.

44:14.732 --> 44:16.774
- Oh come on.

44:16.817 --> 44:20.401
I would say those decisions
led you to an incredible life.

44:21.821 --> 44:24.030
And they got you Carly.

44:25.867 --> 44:26.699
- True.

44:28.661 --> 44:31.496
But if I'm being honest,
she wasn't always a picnic.

44:34.501 --> 44:37.877
- Was it hard watching her
become more and more successful

44:37.921 --> 44:38.836
while you are struggling?

44:38.880 --> 44:39.796
- Actually, no.

44:41.049 --> 44:41.088
I mean, that's what
everybody thinks,

44:42.090 --> 44:44.174
but, uh, I've had
a blessed life.

44:44.218 --> 44:46.176
It was her turn, I get it.

44:46.220 --> 44:48.094
- Well so, what was the problem?

44:50.182 --> 44:51.640
- She'd been cheating on me.

44:52.601 --> 44:53.433
- Oh.

44:54.478 --> 44:55.560
Geez, I'm,

44:55.604 --> 44:56.394
I'm sorry.

44:58.482 --> 45:00.065
- She eventually fessed up,

45:00.108 --> 45:02.359
and I never figured
out who the guy was.

45:03.694 --> 45:04.860
When we decided to reconcile,

45:04.904 --> 45:06.612
she broke it off with him.

45:06.656 --> 45:08.781
- Gareth, Carly has a jilted ex

45:08.825 --> 45:10.491
who has ample reason to have--

45:10.535 --> 45:11.242
- No.

45:12.161 --> 45:12.201
- This could exonerate you!

45:13.496 --> 45:14.036
- I'm not gonna smear
her to save my own butt.

45:15.122 --> 45:16.080
- You hired me to
do a job, right?

45:17.708 --> 45:18.916
I'm telling you, you don't
have the luxury to do that.

45:26.716 --> 45:27.841
- You know, after
Emily put Mina to bed,

45:27.884 --> 45:29.843
we had a chance to talk.

45:29.886 --> 45:30.885
- About what?

45:32.222 --> 45:33.763
- About the year we broke up.

45:35.433 --> 45:36.474
About your mom.

45:37.519 --> 45:38.893
About Emily's problems.

45:42.065 --> 45:43.690
Why did you keep that from me?

45:44.818 --> 45:47.067
- You were on your
way to a new life.

45:47.111 --> 45:49.278
- A new life that was
supposed to include you.

45:54.869 --> 45:55.951
- My mom was dying.

45:57.204 --> 45:58.829
My sister was off her meds.

45:58.873 --> 46:00.122
I was in college.

46:01.625 --> 46:03.500
I'm allowed to have
made a few mistakes.

46:04.753 --> 46:06.336
- So dumping me was a mistake?

46:06.380 --> 46:09.130
(emotional music)

46:11.634 --> 46:13.384
- All right, I have
to be up at 5:00.

46:16.389 --> 46:17.179
- Good night.

46:18.683 --> 46:19.515
- Night.

46:20.268 --> 46:22.727
(gentle music)

46:39.703 --> 46:41.119
Hey, Mina.

46:41.163 --> 46:42.704
- Hi.

46:42.748 --> 46:43.496
- How was school?

46:44.958 --> 46:46.207
- You're late.

46:46.251 --> 46:48.668
- 15 minutes tops.

46:48.712 --> 46:49.628
Will you forgive me?

46:51.047 --> 46:51.837
- Forgiven.

46:53.883 --> 46:54.965
Guess what?

46:55.009 --> 46:56.050
- What?

46:57.595 --> 46:58.636
- I told everyone that Rolo
was staying at our house

46:58.679 --> 47:00.888
and no one believed me.

47:00.932 --> 47:02.681
Juan called me a liar,

47:02.725 --> 47:05.976
so I said that he'd be at
our play date on Saturday.

47:07.897 --> 47:08.729
- Honey.

47:11.609 --> 47:12.649
You, me, and your mom

47:13.985 --> 47:15.485
were gonna keep that
between us, remember?

47:15.528 --> 47:19.238
- I know, it was just too
exciting to keep a secret.

47:19.282 --> 47:21.532
And people shouldn't be
keeping secrets anyways.

47:21.576 --> 47:22.367
It's rude.

47:23.703 --> 47:25.203
- True.

47:25.246 --> 47:26.329
- [Mina] So he can come?

47:30.293 --> 47:31.501
- Let's get ice cream.

47:31.544 --> 47:32.335
- Yes!

47:42.388 --> 47:45.555
- [Ramona] Well, that's a
mess of your own making.

47:45.599 --> 47:46.473
- What would you do?

47:48.519 --> 47:50.811
- [Ramona] I'd ask my former
boss to help save the day

47:50.854 --> 47:51.603
because she just--

47:51.647 --> 47:52.688
- So help me.

47:52.731 --> 47:54.647
Come on, I am not in the mood.

47:54.691 --> 47:56.023
- Okay, relax.

47:56.067 --> 47:57.525
I went along my secret grapevine

47:57.568 --> 48:00.111
and I, uh, found this
ripe little number.

48:01.698 --> 48:02.405
- I don't get it.

48:03.324 --> 48:03.781
- [Ramona] Just press play.

48:09.872 --> 48:11.747
- Ian!
- Oh my god.

48:11.791 --> 48:12.373
- Come on buddy, I got you.
- Gareth.

48:13.459 --> 48:13.749
- [Gareth] Come
on, stay with me!

48:15.003 --> 48:15.793
- Where is this from?

48:17.170 --> 48:17.544
- It's from a
behind-the-scenes documentary

48:18.505 --> 48:19.295
from Gareth's movie Overdrive.

48:19.339 --> 48:20.922
- He risked his life!

48:20.966 --> 48:22.799
- And someone who risks
his life like that

48:22.843 --> 48:24.551
for another human being,

48:24.594 --> 48:25.927
they don't kill their wife.

48:27.305 --> 48:29.931
- Why has this not
come out earlier?

48:29.975 --> 48:31.641
- A second stunt driver
died in the accident.

48:31.685 --> 48:32.684
The studio buried the story.

48:34.354 --> 48:35.520
This was pre TMI Today, when
you could actually do that.

48:36.815 --> 48:38.564
- This is huge.

48:38.607 --> 48:40.065
- Yeah.

48:40.109 --> 48:40.858
So use it.

48:42.028 --> 48:42.735
Or don't use it.

48:43.696 --> 48:44.111
I'm gonna leave it up to you.

48:47.158 --> 48:48.907
- I owe you one.

48:48.951 --> 48:51.035
- Just get through all
this craziness with Gareth,

48:51.078 --> 48:52.745
then back to
building your dreams,

48:52.788 --> 48:53.871
and then we'll be even.

49:06.468 --> 49:07.341
- [Ian] Hey.

49:08.636 --> 49:08.676
- [Adrienne] Hey,
thanks for meeting me.

49:09.387 --> 49:09.635
- Yeah, what's going on?

49:10.513 --> 49:11.471
- What is this?

49:12.932 --> 49:14.140
- Where'd you get this?

49:17.687 --> 49:20.396
- Why didn't you tell me
that Gareth saved your life?

49:21.857 --> 49:22.939
I'm not mad.

49:24.068 --> 49:25.984
I just,

49:26.028 --> 49:27.652
I don't understand.

49:30.074 --> 49:31.865
- Well you remember how I
said that I lost someone?

49:35.454 --> 49:37.370
- She was the one that
died in the crash?

49:38.457 --> 49:40.665
- Her name was Diana.

49:40.709 --> 49:42.958
- Oh, Ian, I am so sorry.

49:45.046 --> 49:46.253
I don't have to use this.

49:46.297 --> 49:47.713
- No, no, it's okay.

49:48.841 --> 49:51.175
Diana would've wanted that.

49:51.219 --> 49:52.843
- Are you sure?

49:52.887 --> 49:54.261
- Of course.

49:54.305 --> 49:56.013
And it's for Gareth.

49:56.057 --> 49:57.056
We have to.

49:57.100 --> 49:59.683
(sweet music)

50:01.854 --> 50:03.812
(kissing)

50:05.190 --> 50:06.022
- Thanks.

50:08.068 --> 50:09.359
- [Ian] Whatever I can do.

50:10.737 --> 50:13.488
(veiled music)

50:18.537 --> 50:19.452
- Hey.
- Hey.

50:19.496 --> 50:20.954
- Hey, where's Gareth?

50:20.997 --> 50:22.747
- Oh, Mina asked
him to tuck her in.

50:22.791 --> 50:23.873
- And he did?

50:23.917 --> 50:25.374
- You don't say
no to my daughter.

50:25.417 --> 50:26.166
You know that.

50:33.968 --> 50:35.968
- And we'll read more tomorrow.

50:36.011 --> 50:37.344
- One more chapter.

50:37.388 --> 50:39.012
- It's already way
past your bedtime.

50:39.056 --> 50:40.514
- I'm not tired.

50:40.558 --> 50:41.932
- How about a night nap spell?

50:41.976 --> 50:42.766
- No.

50:44.812 --> 50:45.644
- What's up?

50:47.355 --> 50:48.396
- I told all my friends

50:49.732 --> 50:50.982
that Rolo was going to
be at our play date,

50:51.025 --> 50:52.984
and I had no idea
it was a secret

50:53.027 --> 50:54.735
that you were staying with us.

50:54.779 --> 50:56.821
- Mm, that stinks.

50:56.865 --> 50:59.365
- And now they all
think I'm a liar.

50:59.409 --> 51:00.324
- That's not okay.

51:02.078 --> 51:04.620
Maybe Rolo can do
something about that.

51:04.664 --> 51:06.706
After all, he does
have magic on his side.

51:06.749 --> 51:07.956
- Really?

51:09.459 --> 51:13.044
- No promises, but if you
try to get some shuteye,

51:13.088 --> 51:14.087
I'll try to make
something happen.

51:16.967 --> 51:17.799
- Deal.

51:17.843 --> 51:20.510
(gentle music)

51:25.851 --> 51:26.933
- Hey.

51:29.854 --> 51:30.769
- Hi.

51:30.813 --> 51:31.770
Auntie Adrienne.

51:31.814 --> 51:32.897
- Can I borrow him?

51:34.859 --> 51:36.859
- Yeah, we're good.

51:36.903 --> 51:38.694
(Gareth and Adrienne laughing)

51:38.738 --> 51:39.904
- Night, Mina.

51:42.658 --> 51:43.782
- Thank you.

51:43.826 --> 51:44.950
Night.

51:44.994 --> 51:49.455
- [Gareth] Good night.

51:49.498 --> 51:52.207
Come on buddy, I got you!

51:52.250 --> 51:52.957
Ian!

51:53.919 --> 51:55.501
- This makes you a hero, Gareth.

51:55.545 --> 51:56.377
- Diana still died.

51:58.340 --> 51:59.964
- That wasn't your fault,

52:00.008 --> 52:02.425
and the public will
see it that way.

52:02.469 --> 52:03.676
- That's like using the
second worst day of my life

52:03.720 --> 52:05.136
to make the worst one better.

52:06.348 --> 52:07.597
- It's not ideal.

52:07.641 --> 52:08.306
I get that.

52:09.517 --> 52:09.557
- [Ian] And what if
that gets twisted

52:10.268 --> 52:11.184
into something negative?

52:11.228 --> 52:12.226
- How?

52:13.896 --> 52:16.104
You pulled a man out of a
burning car at your own peril.

52:18.359 --> 52:20.817
Unless there's something
you're not telling me.

52:24.573 --> 52:26.031
Is there?

52:26.075 --> 52:27.282
- No, no no no.

52:27.326 --> 52:28.325
Of course not.

52:31.163 --> 52:32.329
Why would I lie to you?

52:34.666 --> 52:35.456
- All right.

52:38.253 --> 52:39.001
I am gonna make sure

52:40.505 --> 52:42.171
Nikki Leone gets her dirty
little fingers on this.

52:44.884 --> 52:48.552
- A source on set the
day of his big save

52:48.596 --> 52:53.307
tells TMI Today that Gareth
Nicks overruled safety experts,

52:53.351 --> 52:55.892
insisting the
stunt be performed.

52:55.936 --> 52:58.186
What's even more interesting,

52:58.230 --> 53:02.732
Gareth was widely rumored to
be sleeping with Diana Hilzer,

53:02.776 --> 53:06.653
the stuntwoman who burned
to death in that crash.

53:06.697 --> 53:08.530
Coincidence?

53:08.573 --> 53:12.409
Or does Gareth simply dispose
of women who try to leave him?

53:13.287 --> 53:14.786
This is TMI Today,

53:14.830 --> 53:17.454
where too much information
is just enough.

53:17.498 --> 53:18.789
- He lied to me!

53:18.833 --> 53:20.624
- Those are just rumors.

53:20.668 --> 53:22.584
- You knew about that?

53:22.628 --> 53:23.460
- Of course I did.

53:23.504 --> 53:24.753
Everyone did.

53:24.797 --> 53:26.755
But no one believed them.

53:26.799 --> 53:27.548
Least of all me.

53:28.926 --> 53:29.216
Look, Gareth would never
do something like that.

53:29.760 --> 53:30.217
It's ridiculous.

53:31.304 --> 53:32.803
- But you're 100% sure

53:32.847 --> 53:34.638
he wasn't having an
affair with Diana?

53:34.682 --> 53:36.223
- You think I'd still
be friends with him?

53:36.267 --> 53:38.516
That'd make me pretty
pathetic, wouldn't it?

53:38.560 --> 53:41.394
- Did he pressure
you to do the stunt?

53:41.438 --> 53:43.479
- Adrienne, Gareth
saved my life.

53:43.523 --> 53:45.023
He chose my life over Diana's

53:45.066 --> 53:46.357
and I can't blame him for that.

53:47.986 --> 53:50.445
- No, but you can resent him.

53:50.488 --> 53:51.779
- It was my call, okay.

53:51.823 --> 53:53.489
I chose to do the stunt.

53:53.533 --> 53:55.158
I lost the love of my life.

53:55.201 --> 53:56.492
And I took the blame for it.

53:56.536 --> 53:57.577
Thanks for reminding me!

53:59.164 --> 54:00.829
- I'm sorry, it's just...

54:01.790 --> 54:02.539
I never--

54:03.959 --> 54:04.124
- No one would hire me
in this town after that

54:04.793 --> 54:05.208
except for Gareth.

54:05.878 --> 54:06.293
He saved my career.

54:07.046 --> 54:08.253
- Yeah, I realize that.

54:08.297 --> 54:10.422
It's just, look,
something is off here.

54:10.466 --> 54:11.465
- What, what, what?

54:11.508 --> 54:12.215
What's off?

54:12.259 --> 54:13.175
What's off?

54:14.511 --> 54:15.469
What the hell do you
want from me, dammit?

54:15.512 --> 54:17.137
What?

54:17.181 --> 54:18.430
- Geez.

54:18.474 --> 54:20.223
You two are more
alike than I thought.

54:21.601 --> 54:22.516
- Adrienne!

54:23.770 --> 54:25.102
Adrienne, I'm sorry, please!

54:25.146 --> 54:27.813
(troubled music)

54:46.375 --> 54:47.832
- I can handle those.

54:47.876 --> 54:48.625
- It's fine.

54:50.379 --> 54:51.795
- You saw the show?

54:51.838 --> 54:53.380
- Good guess.

54:53.423 --> 54:56.007
Do you even know
why I'm helping you?

54:56.051 --> 54:57.634
- I know you don't want anyone
to know you're helping me.

54:57.677 --> 54:58.802
- That's right.

55:00.180 --> 55:01.638
I have a business to run
and a family to feed.

55:03.100 --> 55:04.139
But I'm still here, aren't I?

55:05.851 --> 55:07.267
- I appreciate everything
you're doing for me, Adrienne.

55:07.311 --> 55:08.060
- Really?

55:09.980 --> 55:13.107
Did I not ask you
very specifically

55:13.150 --> 55:15.275
if there was something
that I should know?

55:17.321 --> 55:18.153
- I'm sorry.

55:19.865 --> 55:22.950
I just, I couldn't
admit those things.

55:23.953 --> 55:24.910
Especially to you.

55:26.204 --> 55:27.412
- So it's true.

55:30.417 --> 55:31.499
All of it?

55:31.543 --> 55:32.125
- Can you let me explain?

55:33.086 --> 55:34.043
- It's a little late for that.

55:34.087 --> 55:35.461
I'm going to bed.

55:35.505 --> 55:37.797
Put those away in the morning.

55:41.636 --> 55:44.387
(creepy music)

56:33.477 --> 56:37.270
(moves into suspenseful music)

56:46.656 --> 56:49.616
(labored breathing)

57:51.343 --> 57:52.425
Okay.

57:52.469 --> 57:54.803
(scary music)

58:04.522 --> 58:06.855
(rustling)

58:29.754 --> 58:31.254
(Adrienne screams)

58:31.298 --> 58:32.213
- [Gareth] Oh, Jesus!

58:32.257 --> 58:33.298
- Gareth?

58:33.341 --> 58:34.799
- Don't do that!

58:34.843 --> 58:35.425
- [Adrienne] What is that?

58:36.886 --> 58:36.926
- What, I thought I heard
someone in the house!

58:37.804 --> 58:37.927
- [Adrienne] You have a gun?

58:38.679 --> 58:38.719
- For protection, yeah.

58:39.430 --> 58:39.511
I've got a license.

58:40.472 --> 58:40.512
- How long have you had that?

58:41.307 --> 58:41.346
- [Gareth] For years, why?

58:42.600 --> 58:44.266
- There is a child in
this house, Gareth!

58:44.310 --> 58:45.267
What if Mina found it?

58:45.311 --> 58:46.768
- I've got a trigger lock.

58:48.188 --> 58:49.688
- Oh wow.

58:49.732 --> 58:50.522
- Hey.

58:50.566 --> 58:51.315
Hey!

58:52.234 --> 58:52.274
I understand that you're upset,

58:53.485 --> 58:53.650
but it's not like
I'm being paranoid!

58:54.903 --> 58:55.110
Someone was actually
trying to kill me!

58:55.863 --> 58:56.653
- Yeah, I realize that.

58:57.906 --> 58:59.323
I was the one who
almost died, remember?

59:00.408 --> 59:02.533
- Look, I promise
I'll get rid of it.

59:02.577 --> 59:03.326
- No.

59:04.454 --> 59:06.370
This is way too much for me.

59:08.541 --> 59:11.083
You're gonna have to find
some other place to stay.

59:16.382 --> 59:17.465
I want you gone by tomorrow.

59:17.508 --> 59:20.301
(ominous music)

1:00:21.695 --> 1:00:23.027
You know, I think your
daughter has a crush on Juan.

1:00:23.071 --> 1:00:24.737
- [Emily] (laughs) I know.

1:00:24.781 --> 1:00:26.446
Wait, how many kids are there?

1:00:26.490 --> 1:00:27.406
- [Adrienne] Four.

1:00:27.449 --> 1:00:28.448
- Okay.

1:00:28.492 --> 1:00:29.157
No no no no no no!

1:00:30.327 --> 1:00:30.909
- What, a little
sugar won't kill them.

1:00:32.454 --> 1:00:32.786
- Well if there are cookies,
why eat anything else?

1:00:33.414 --> 1:00:35.664
(phone vibrating)

1:00:47.719 --> 1:00:49.885
(typing)

1:00:55.309 --> 1:00:56.100
What is it?

1:00:56.144 --> 1:00:56.892
- Uh, nothing.

1:00:57.937 --> 1:01:00.354
- Okay, well, I am hiding these.

1:01:03.234 --> 1:01:06.193
(doorbell rings)

1:01:07.947 --> 1:01:10.071
(typing)

1:01:12.367 --> 1:01:13.199
- Coming!

1:01:17.247 --> 1:01:18.288
Hi!

1:01:18.331 --> 1:01:19.330
- [Kids] Hi!

1:01:19.499 --> 1:01:20.039
- Where's Mina?

1:01:20.917 --> 1:01:21.416
- She will be down in a sec.

1:01:21.460 --> 1:01:22.208
- [Simone] Okay.

1:01:22.252 --> 1:01:23.209
- Hi, Juan.

1:01:23.253 --> 1:01:24.043
- Hi.

1:01:24.087 --> 1:01:25.378
- [Simone] Mina!

1:01:25.422 --> 1:01:27.088
- Hi, guys!

1:01:27.132 --> 1:01:30.008
(moms chatting)

1:01:30.050 --> 1:01:33.135
- [Simone] Come on,
come on, let's go!

1:01:33.179 --> 1:01:35.512
(eerie music)

1:01:37.558 --> 1:01:38.974
- [Adrienne] I'll
be there in a sec.

1:01:39.018 --> 1:01:40.434
- [Ramona] Okay.

1:01:40.478 --> 1:01:42.478
- Do you guys ever call?

1:01:42.521 --> 1:01:44.354
- I was debating about
whether to say anything.

1:01:44.398 --> 1:01:45.022
- [Adrienne] Say what?

1:01:45.941 --> 1:01:46.190
- Gareth, he's acting weird,

1:01:47.151 --> 1:01:47.691
especially about you and Carly.

1:01:54.032 --> 1:01:55.448
- How so?

1:01:55.492 --> 1:01:57.617
- He keeps confusing you two.

1:01:57.660 --> 1:01:58.743
- I don't understand.

1:02:00.246 --> 1:02:00.369
- He keeps swapping your
names out for each other,

1:02:01.915 --> 1:02:03.247
like, "I can't believe
anyone would hurt Adrienne,"

1:02:03.291 --> 1:02:05.208
or, "Carly's so nice to
let me stay at her house."

1:02:05.251 --> 1:02:06.667
It's weird.

1:02:06.711 --> 1:02:09.003
- He's not staying here anymore.

1:02:09.047 --> 1:02:09.837
I kicked him out.

1:02:11.424 --> 1:02:12.548
- Really?

1:02:12.592 --> 1:02:13.381
When?

1:02:13.425 --> 1:02:14.424
- Last night.

1:02:15.719 --> 1:02:16.510
- Well it's, it's
probably for the best.

1:02:17.513 --> 1:02:19.513
I know he's not right.

1:02:19.556 --> 1:02:21.973
- I don't know, I, I thought
that I could help him.

1:02:22.810 --> 1:02:23.892
- You have helped him.

1:02:25.395 --> 1:02:27.562
Look, he's a big boy, he
can take care of himself.

1:02:31.318 --> 1:02:33.193
- Well I've gotta...

1:02:33.237 --> 1:02:35.110
- Just know that
I'm here for you.

1:02:35.154 --> 1:02:38.030
(suspicious music)

1:02:47.333 --> 1:02:49.083
- That didn't even make it in!

1:02:49.126 --> 1:02:50.417
- It did too!

1:02:50.461 --> 1:02:52.044
- I'm totally
gonna win this one.

1:02:52.088 --> 1:02:53.003
- I'm bored!

1:02:54.131 --> 1:02:54.213
When is Rolo coming?
- Yeah, Rolo!

1:02:54.924 --> 1:02:56.130
- He's gonna be here.

1:02:56.174 --> 1:02:57.340
- Two in one!
- No he's not,

1:02:57.384 --> 1:02:58.883
because he's not even real!

1:02:58.927 --> 1:02:59.884
- Be quiet, Juan.

1:02:59.928 --> 1:03:00.552
- [Hunter] Yeah, be quiet.

1:03:01.805 --> 1:03:03.137
- Rolo is a sorcerer
and you're stupid.

1:03:03.181 --> 1:03:05.223
- [Gareth] Hello!

1:03:05.267 --> 1:03:06.391
- [Mina] Rolo!

1:03:07.394 --> 1:03:08.852
(Mina squeals)

1:03:08.895 --> 1:03:10.270
- Hello, Mina.
- I told you!

1:03:10.313 --> 1:03:11.729
- [Gareth] How's my
newest apprentice?

1:03:11.773 --> 1:03:13.064
- Good!
- Mina, have you been working

1:03:13.108 --> 1:03:14.983
on your lightning spell?
- Yes!

1:03:15.026 --> 1:03:17.026
- Are there any other
young sorcerers among you?

1:03:17.070 --> 1:03:19.111
- Oh, me, me!
- Come on, you guys!

1:03:19.154 --> 1:03:20.279
(kids laughing)

1:03:20.322 --> 1:03:21.822
- Hey.

1:03:21.866 --> 1:03:22.614
- [Gareth] Hi.

1:03:22.658 --> 1:03:23.574
- [Adrienne] Rolo.

1:03:23.617 --> 1:03:24.241
- Aunt Adrienne, look who came!

1:03:25.327 --> 1:03:26.702
- At the behest
of sorceress Mina,

1:03:26.745 --> 1:03:27.703
I'm here to find out,

1:03:29.123 --> 1:03:29.997
are there any other young
sorcerers among you?

1:03:30.040 --> 1:03:31.832
- Me, me!
- Me me me me!

1:03:31.876 --> 1:03:34.376
- You, over there.
- Aw.

1:03:34.420 --> 1:03:36.378
- Me?
- Lucky Juan.

1:03:36.422 --> 1:03:38.338
- I've heard quite
a lot about you.

1:03:39.257 --> 1:03:40.256
- Bad things?

1:03:42.427 --> 1:03:44.051
- [Ramona] Everything
okay up there?

1:03:44.095 --> 1:03:46.053
- Uh, yeah, Ramona,
everything's fine!

1:03:46.097 --> 1:03:48.389
Just a bit of roughhousing!

1:03:48.433 --> 1:03:49.765
All right kids,
play date's over.

1:03:49.809 --> 1:03:51.267
Everybody out.

1:03:51.311 --> 1:03:54.145
- Aw, Auntie Adrienne,
that's not fair!

1:03:54.188 --> 1:03:56.480
- Downstairs,
downstairs, come on, out.

1:03:56.524 --> 1:03:58.399
- Please!
- But Auntie Adrienne!

1:03:58.443 --> 1:04:02.485
- Everyone downstairs.
(Mina groans)

1:04:02.529 --> 1:04:04.446
What are you doing here?

1:04:04.489 --> 1:04:05.447
- I promised her.

1:04:23.466 --> 1:04:25.549
I know it was a risk.

1:04:25.593 --> 1:04:28.385
I figured if the parents
were downstairs...

1:04:28.429 --> 1:04:29.178
- Come on, Gareth.

1:04:29.221 --> 1:04:30.554
That was irresponsible.

1:04:30.598 --> 1:04:32.556
- I know, I know.

1:04:32.600 --> 1:04:33.349
Sorry.

1:04:36.729 --> 1:04:37.561
- But

1:04:41.317 --> 1:04:43.566
I have never seen Mina so happy.

1:04:44.819 --> 1:04:46.569
Oh, and the look on Juan's face!

1:04:46.613 --> 1:04:50.365
(Gareth and Adrienne laughing)

1:04:51.534 --> 1:04:52.325
- I needed that.

1:04:55.497 --> 1:04:57.705
Do you know how long it's been
since I made anyone happy?

1:04:59.459 --> 1:05:00.458
- Well I'm glad,

1:05:01.795 --> 1:05:03.962
but I'm still gonna have
to ask you to leave.

1:05:05.422 --> 1:05:07.381
I'm sorry, I know
you understand.

1:05:08.384 --> 1:05:09.883
- Of course I do.

1:05:12.888 --> 1:05:15.263
- There are times
when I see the Gareth

1:05:15.307 --> 1:05:17.224
that I knew in college, then--

1:05:17.267 --> 1:05:18.809
- Hey.

1:05:18.852 --> 1:05:19.726
I get it, I get it.

1:05:21.522 --> 1:05:22.646
We can't work together.

1:05:24.316 --> 1:05:25.399
- We can't.

1:05:28.236 --> 1:05:30.403
But I may still
have one last move.

1:05:31.948 --> 1:05:32.697
We'll see.

1:05:34.409 --> 1:05:36.200
- Adrienne, I don't
want you to do anything

1:05:36.244 --> 1:05:37.326
that's gonna put you at risk.

1:05:37.370 --> 1:05:38.244
- I can't help it.

1:05:39.455 --> 1:05:40.705
It's who I am.

1:05:40.748 --> 1:05:43.457
(emotional music)

1:05:49.297 --> 1:05:50.213
Where will you go?

1:05:52.259 --> 1:05:53.174
- I'll be fine.

1:05:53.218 --> 1:05:55.927
(somber music)

1:06:00.851 --> 1:06:04.436
(engine cranking)

1:06:04.479 --> 1:06:07.230
- [Adrienne] Ramona, someone
has information about Carly.

1:06:07.274 --> 1:06:08.440
- [Ramona] Who?

1:06:08.483 --> 1:06:10.399
- Well, they wouldn't say.

1:06:10.443 --> 1:06:12.985
But apparently it's
information about Carly

1:06:13.029 --> 1:06:14.361
that hasn't gone public yet.

1:06:17.033 --> 1:06:18.866
- Tell me that you're not
meeting some deep throat

1:06:18.909 --> 1:06:20.409
in some parking garage.

1:06:20.453 --> 1:06:22.327
- Very funny.

1:06:22.371 --> 1:06:23.245
No.

1:06:24.415 --> 1:06:24.455
No, they want to
meet at a restaurant

1:06:25.207 --> 1:06:25.789
20 minutes from Malibu.

1:06:26.876 --> 1:06:27.916
- I'm going with you.

1:06:28.961 --> 1:06:29.877
- Seriously?

1:06:29.920 --> 1:06:31.210
- No arguments.

1:06:37.469 --> 1:06:38.634
We're early, for Pete's sake.

1:06:38.678 --> 1:06:39.844
What is the rush?

1:06:41.598 --> 1:06:43.681
- This guy has been riding me
for like the last two miles.

1:06:43.725 --> 1:06:47.769
Don't freak out, but it looks
exactly like Gareth's SUV.

1:06:47.812 --> 1:06:48.352
- [Ramona] You're kidding me.

1:06:48.396 --> 1:06:49.520
- Or Ian's.

1:06:51.066 --> 1:06:51.980
- Are you kidding me?

1:06:52.024 --> 1:06:53.356
- They drive the same car.

1:06:54.485 --> 1:06:55.192
- Okay, great.

1:06:56.070 --> 1:06:56.276
I am not gonna be collateral

1:06:57.446 --> 1:06:57.486
in your little
love triangle here.

1:06:58.113 --> 1:06:58.653
(car horn honking)

1:06:58.697 --> 1:07:00.238
- Whoa.

1:07:00.282 --> 1:07:02.866
(engine revving)

1:07:02.910 --> 1:07:05.786
(car horn honking)

1:07:07.748 --> 1:07:09.331
- Whoa.

1:07:09.374 --> 1:07:10.373
Whoa, whoa whoa whoa!

1:07:10.417 --> 1:07:11.583
- [Adrienne] What is going--

1:07:11.627 --> 1:07:13.126
- [Ramona] I, I don't know.

1:07:13.170 --> 1:07:15.461
(car horn honking)
(Adrienne screams)

1:07:15.505 --> 1:07:16.045
- No no no no no no no!

1:07:16.089 --> 1:07:18.422
(crashing)

1:07:20.885 --> 1:07:23.010
- [Mina] Is Auntie Adrienne
going to be all right?

1:07:23.054 --> 1:07:26.764
- [Emily] Yeah, she's
gonna be fine, honey.

1:07:26.808 --> 1:07:28.224
- Look, I think she's waking up.

1:07:28.267 --> 1:07:30.601
- I think you're right.

1:07:30.645 --> 1:07:32.645
There she is.

1:07:33.898 --> 1:07:37.357
So, apparently you're
indestructible.

1:07:37.400 --> 1:07:40.193
No internal bleeding,
no broken bones.

1:07:40.237 --> 1:07:41.820
Just a minor concussion.

1:07:43.240 --> 1:07:44.239
- Where's Ramona?

1:07:44.282 --> 1:07:45.698
- Ah ah ah, don't you move.

1:07:45.826 --> 1:07:47.033
I'll find out, okay?

1:07:49.454 --> 1:07:51.204
- If you get band-aids,
can I have some?

1:07:51.248 --> 1:07:51.996
- Mina.

1:07:52.040 --> 1:07:52.747
- What?

1:07:54.084 --> 1:07:55.542
- Mommy can take you
to the nurse's station.

1:07:55.585 --> 1:07:58.210
I'm sure they have plenty.

1:07:58.254 --> 1:07:59.419
- Can we, please?

1:08:00.506 --> 1:08:01.505
- I'll be right back.

1:08:03.217 --> 1:08:05.175
I love you, sis.

1:08:05.219 --> 1:08:06.301
- Love you.

1:08:06.345 --> 1:08:08.804
(veiled music)

1:08:18.148 --> 1:08:20.565
(Adrienne grunts)

1:08:30.869 --> 1:08:33.202
Nurse, excuse me?

1:08:37.792 --> 1:08:38.791
Simone?

1:08:40.085 --> 1:08:41.084
Hey, Simone?

1:08:45.841 --> 1:08:46.715
Hey, honey?

1:08:48.552 --> 1:08:50.719
Is your mom in there?

1:08:50.762 --> 1:08:52.721
- She's sleeping.

1:08:52.764 --> 1:08:55.265
But she won't wake up,

1:08:55.309 --> 1:08:56.516
even when I ask her to.

1:08:59.396 --> 1:09:00.853
- Honey, she will wake up.

1:09:01.856 --> 1:09:02.813
She'll be all right.

1:09:02.857 --> 1:09:04.315
She'll wake up.

1:09:04.358 --> 1:09:05.232
- You promise?

1:09:06.736 --> 1:09:07.651
- I promise.

1:09:12.617 --> 1:09:15.326
(elevator dings)

1:09:18.122 --> 1:09:20.247
- Hey.

1:09:20.291 --> 1:09:20.873
I got here as fast as I could.

1:09:21.751 --> 1:09:21.790
- What are you doing here?

1:09:22.459 --> 1:09:22.498
- I had to see you.

1:09:23.251 --> 1:09:23.291
What did the doctors say?

1:09:24.002 --> 1:09:25.376
- Ramona is in a coma.

1:09:25.420 --> 1:09:26.169
- Oh my god, I'm so sorry.

1:09:26.213 --> 1:09:28.087
- Why?

1:09:28.131 --> 1:09:28.796
- What are you talking about?

1:09:30.508 --> 1:09:30.548
- [Detective Phelps] Miss
Kleiner, it's Detective Phelps.

1:09:31.384 --> 1:09:31.966
May I come in?
- Come in!

1:09:39.935 --> 1:09:41.142
- Hi.

1:09:41.186 --> 1:09:41.726
- [Detective Phelps]
Detective Phelps.

1:09:42.604 --> 1:09:43.436
We spoke at Phil Navarro's.

1:09:43.480 --> 1:09:44.519
- [Adrienne] I remember.

1:09:45.481 --> 1:09:47.272
- How are you feeling?

1:09:47.316 --> 1:09:49.775
- Like I was just
in a car crash.

1:09:49.818 --> 1:09:50.984
Did you find the driver yet?

1:09:52.029 --> 1:09:53.362
- Not yet, but we're on it.

1:09:53.405 --> 1:09:54.238
I assure you.

1:09:56.033 --> 1:09:56.698
Let me ask you a question.

1:09:58.452 --> 1:10:00.869
Uh, where were you headed when,
uh, the collision occurred?

1:10:02.122 --> 1:10:02.746
- Earlier that morning,

1:10:04.041 --> 1:10:04.581
someone had text me
about Carly's murder

1:10:05.333 --> 1:10:06.499
from an unknown number.

1:10:08.461 --> 1:10:09.627
We were gonna meet them at a
restaurant north of Malibu.

1:10:11.214 --> 1:10:13.130
- And you trusted that they
were, uh, telling the truth?

1:10:13.174 --> 1:10:16.801
- Yeah, they knew that Carly
had been cheating on Gareth.

1:10:16.844 --> 1:10:18.427
Gareth and I are the only people

1:10:18.471 --> 1:10:21.597
who could possibly
have known that.

1:10:21.641 --> 1:10:22.265
- [Detective
Phelps] Why is that?

1:10:23.768 --> 1:10:24.600
- Because Gareth had just
told me a few days ago,

1:10:26.229 --> 1:10:28.270
and I am assuming it wasn't
Carly that was texting me,

1:10:28.397 --> 1:10:29.729
clearly.

1:10:29.773 --> 1:10:30.522
- Right.

1:10:32.317 --> 1:10:33.858
- You know what I think?

1:10:33.902 --> 1:10:35.735
I think that they
were gonna tell me

1:10:35.779 --> 1:10:37.237
that Carly's lover murdered her.

1:10:38.865 --> 1:10:40.657
- We've already
looked into that.

1:10:40.701 --> 1:10:41.700
- And?

1:10:44.413 --> 1:10:46.162
It's confidential.

1:10:46.206 --> 1:10:47.455
- [Detective Phelps]
Yeah, for the time being.

1:10:48.624 --> 1:10:51.333
- All I know is
the car that hit us

1:10:51.377 --> 1:10:54.420
is the exact model that
Gareth Nicks drives.

1:10:54.505 --> 1:10:57.423
It had been tailgating us
for miles before it hit us.

1:10:57.466 --> 1:10:59.550
- [Patient] Wait, I know you!

1:10:59.593 --> 1:11:00.384
- Sh!

1:11:01.637 --> 1:11:02.052
- I will not be
shushed, young man!

1:11:04.056 --> 1:11:06.056
- How about this?

1:11:06.100 --> 1:11:07.474
- [Patient] Ah, keep 'em coming!

1:11:08.477 --> 1:11:10.476
Yeah, oh boy! (laughs)

1:11:10.520 --> 1:11:13.396
Thank you! (laughs)

1:11:13.440 --> 1:11:14.731
- Interesting.

1:11:17.402 --> 1:11:20.320
So uh, Gareth Nicks, huh?

1:11:20.363 --> 1:11:21.237
- Uh-huh.

1:11:21.281 --> 1:11:22.655
- Well, that's a start.

1:11:23.533 --> 1:11:25.158
Any idea where he is?

1:11:25.201 --> 1:11:25.533
- Hiding.

1:11:28.872 --> 1:11:30.580
- Of course, right.

1:11:30.623 --> 1:11:32.998
Well, if you see him,
you'll call us, right?

1:11:34.043 --> 1:11:35.042
- You can count on it.

1:11:40.841 --> 1:11:42.341
Gareth.

1:11:43.844 --> 1:11:44.593
Gareth.

1:11:46.138 --> 1:11:46.803
Gareth!

1:11:48.515 --> 1:11:49.765
- A gift from Rolo!

1:11:56.773 --> 1:11:59.315
- Hey Adrienne, we're home.

1:11:59.359 --> 1:12:02.151
Oh my god, is that
who I think it is?

1:12:03.529 --> 1:12:04.612
- Hey!

1:12:04.655 --> 1:12:06.113
- It's Ian!

1:12:06.157 --> 1:12:07.990
What is he doing here?

1:12:08.034 --> 1:12:09.825
Did you, did you tell
him to come here?

1:12:10.995 --> 1:12:11.786
- Of course not.

1:12:14.748 --> 1:12:16.122
- Emily!

1:12:17.834 --> 1:12:20.502
Listen, I just, I'd like
to talk to Adrienne.

1:12:20.545 --> 1:12:22.420
- Look, Ian, it's
really not a great time.

1:12:22.464 --> 1:12:22.879
- [Ian] I just need
to talk to Adrienne.

1:12:23.924 --> 1:12:24.464
- Auntie Adrienne,
what's going on?

1:12:25.884 --> 1:12:25.924
- It's about Gareth, okay?
- Don't worry.

1:12:27.094 --> 1:12:27.425
- [Emily] And FYI,
you're trespassing.

1:12:29.012 --> 1:12:29.427
- It's about Gareth.
- Everything will be okay.

1:12:30.138 --> 1:12:30.595
- All right, Adrienne.

1:12:30.806 --> 1:12:31.513
- Ian.

1:12:31.556 --> 1:12:32.847
- [Ian] Are you okay?

1:12:32.891 --> 1:12:33.848
- Ian, what do you want?

1:12:33.892 --> 1:12:35.183
- [Ian] Look, it's about Gareth.

1:12:35.226 --> 1:12:36.183
He came to my house last night.

1:12:36.227 --> 1:12:37.059
He was, he was spiraling,

1:12:38.479 --> 1:12:39.812
and I think this time
he's out of control.

1:12:39.855 --> 1:12:40.854
- He's a big boy.

1:12:40.898 --> 1:12:41.772
You said it yourself.

1:12:43.567 --> 1:12:43.899
- Yes, I know, but he came
to my house last night.

1:12:45.778 --> 1:12:47.027
His car was demolished, the
entire back end demolished.

1:12:47.071 --> 1:12:47.861
- Enough!

1:12:47.905 --> 1:12:49.238
- Em, wait, let him finish.

1:12:50.032 --> 1:12:51.532
- Thank you.

1:12:51.575 --> 1:12:52.449
Thank you.

1:12:52.493 --> 1:12:53.826
Look, he's done this before.

1:12:53.869 --> 1:12:55.911
He's gotten plastered,
he's come to my place,

1:12:55.955 --> 1:12:57.078
his car is totaled,

1:12:57.122 --> 1:12:57.703
he brings it to my place,

1:12:59.290 --> 1:12:59.539
I got a guy that can repair it

1:13:00.708 --> 1:13:01.457
and he takes care
of it discreetly.

1:13:01.501 --> 1:13:02.291
All right?

1:13:02.335 --> 1:13:03.668
But I swear

1:13:05.338 --> 1:13:06.504
he's done this before, and
last night he did it again.

1:13:06.548 --> 1:13:07.713
- Last night?

1:13:07.757 --> 1:13:08.798
- Yes, last night.

1:13:10.635 --> 1:13:13.511
- All right.

1:13:13.555 --> 1:13:16.013
All right, Ian, I'm gonna
have to ask you to leave.

1:13:16.057 --> 1:13:17.890
- Okay, okay, I'm going,

1:13:17.934 --> 1:13:20.517
but please, Adrienne,
stay away from Gareth.

1:13:20.561 --> 1:13:22.811
I'm convinced now
that he's dangerous.

1:13:25.441 --> 1:13:26.481
Please.

1:13:26.525 --> 1:13:29.151
(suspicious music)

1:13:34.908 --> 1:13:37.701
- I hired Marsh and Marsh.

1:13:40.329 --> 1:13:42.121
From the looks of your
face, you haven't seen it?

1:13:42.165 --> 1:13:42.913
- What?

1:13:45.001 --> 1:13:46.917
- You should've told me.

1:13:46.961 --> 1:13:49.211
- Gareth Nicks struck
again last night

1:13:49.255 --> 1:13:52.423
as he's suspected
of ramming his SUV

1:13:52.508 --> 1:13:55.885
into the car of his PR
rep, Adrienne Kleiner,

1:13:55.928 --> 1:13:59.805
and her mentor, the
legendary Ramona Woodbury.

1:14:00.766 --> 1:14:03.057
Ramona is in a coma.

1:14:03.101 --> 1:14:05.894
Adrienne's status
is unconfirmed.

1:14:05.937 --> 1:14:10.773
But as it turns out, Adrienne
was more than his rep.

1:14:11.443 --> 1:14:14.360
The two were
college sweethearts,

1:14:14.404 --> 1:14:17.655
reunited after Carly's death.

1:14:17.699 --> 1:14:20.825
And apparently, the
two shacked up together

1:14:20.869 --> 1:14:23.744
less than a week
after the murder.

1:14:23.787 --> 1:14:26.747
Can you say pure evil?

1:14:26.790 --> 1:14:28.707
And why did Adrienne
think she'd fare

1:14:28.751 --> 1:14:30.167
any better than his wife

1:14:30.211 --> 1:14:32.961
or that poor stuntwoman?

1:14:33.005 --> 1:14:36.632
When you try to charm a
snake, you just might get bit,

1:14:37.676 --> 1:14:38.509
Adrienne.

1:14:39.678 --> 1:14:40.719
This has been TMI.

1:14:41.847 --> 1:14:43.639
- True or false?

1:14:46.351 --> 1:14:47.016
- It's true.

1:14:48.436 --> 1:14:49.644
All of it.

1:14:49.687 --> 1:14:51.437
- Why didn't you tell
me he was your client?

1:14:51.481 --> 1:14:52.939
It's not like it never came up.

1:14:52.982 --> 1:14:54.482
- You're right, I should have.

1:14:54.526 --> 1:14:57.818
- Look, this wasn't an
easy decision for me.

1:14:57.862 --> 1:14:58.945
I really like you.

1:15:00.448 --> 1:15:03.741
It's just I gotta be
able to trust you.

1:15:05.577 --> 1:15:06.243
- I get it.

1:15:08.580 --> 1:15:11.831
- I gotta ask you,
why did you help him?

1:15:11.875 --> 1:15:14.334
I mean, when the rest of
the world knew he did it?

1:15:15.712 --> 1:15:16.795
- History.

1:15:21.176 --> 1:15:22.342
We had history.

1:15:30.601 --> 1:15:31.850
- You loved him.

1:15:31.894 --> 1:15:32.977
- Oh boy.

1:15:35.523 --> 1:15:37.398
Yeah, at one point.

1:15:37.441 --> 1:15:38.899
And I don't know, maybe,

1:15:40.778 --> 1:15:42.820
but there was something else,

1:15:42.863 --> 1:15:45.072
something that I can't explain.

1:15:45.116 --> 1:15:46.907
- Well, what is it?

1:15:49.202 --> 1:15:51.869
- This stays here, you promise?

1:15:51.913 --> 1:15:53.413
- Promise.

1:15:53.456 --> 1:15:55.456
- Someone tried to kill Gareth.

1:15:55.500 --> 1:15:57.083
- You know this for sure?

1:15:57.127 --> 1:15:57.792
- I was there.

1:15:58.712 --> 1:15:59.669
You see, they had rigged his car

1:15:59.713 --> 1:16:01.671
to be like this,
this death trap,

1:16:01.715 --> 1:16:03.506
but I was the one
that got trapped,

1:16:03.550 --> 1:16:04.632
and Gareth,

1:16:06.428 --> 1:16:08.011
he saved my life.

1:16:09.598 --> 1:16:11.305
- Wow.

1:16:11.348 --> 1:16:12.764
I didn't see that one coming.

1:16:14.476 --> 1:16:15.976
Wait a minute.

1:16:16.020 --> 1:16:18.103
Why keep that a secret?

1:16:18.147 --> 1:16:20.439
I mean, isn't that all
the proof you would need?

1:16:22.443 --> 1:16:23.150
- You're right.

1:16:24.778 --> 1:16:26.653
Okay.

1:16:26.697 --> 1:16:27.487
Thank you!

1:16:30.367 --> 1:16:32.450
Thank you.

1:17:22.875 --> 1:17:23.707
- Sleeping.

1:17:24.919 --> 1:17:26.919
- Can I come inside?

1:17:26.962 --> 1:17:27.878
- Sure.

1:17:28.089 --> 1:17:30.964
(menacing music)

1:18:05.582 --> 1:18:06.873
- Em, Mina!

1:18:06.917 --> 1:18:09.501
(shocked music)

1:18:11.547 --> 1:18:12.421
Emily?

1:18:12.464 --> 1:18:15.382
(suspenseful music)

1:18:23.558 --> 1:18:24.181
Mina!

1:18:24.225 --> 1:18:26.934
(perplexed music)

1:18:35.528 --> 1:18:36.360
What?

1:18:37.864 --> 1:18:40.196
"It's time for us to
be together at last.

1:18:40.240 --> 1:18:41.531
"Meet me at my house
tonight at midnight.

1:18:41.575 --> 1:18:42.407
"Alone.

1:18:43.869 --> 1:18:46.619
"Please don't be upset
but I took Emily.

1:18:46.663 --> 1:18:49.831
"Consider her collateral in
case you decide not to come.

1:18:49.875 --> 1:18:51.916
"Undying love, Gareth."

1:18:53.253 --> 1:18:54.210
- Auntie Adrienne?

1:18:54.254 --> 1:18:55.003
- Mina!

1:18:58.633 --> 1:18:59.883
Are you okay?

1:18:59.926 --> 1:19:01.217
Where were you?

1:19:01.261 --> 1:19:03.177
- He told me to
hide in the closet.

1:19:03.220 --> 1:19:03.886
- [Adrienne] Who did?

1:19:03.929 --> 1:19:04.636
- Gareth.

1:19:06.307 --> 1:19:08.390
He told me not to come out
unless you or mommy got me.

1:19:08.434 --> 1:19:09.391
- What?

1:19:09.435 --> 1:19:10.684
- Where is she?

1:19:10.770 --> 1:19:11.977
- She

1:19:13.147 --> 1:19:13.687
had to go out.

1:19:14.857 --> 1:19:16.440
Honey, how would you feel

1:19:16.484 --> 1:19:17.524
about staying the
night at Simone's?

1:19:17.568 --> 1:19:19.067
- Is something wrong?

1:19:20.696 --> 1:19:23.321
- I am gonna make
everything all right.

1:19:23.364 --> 1:19:24.280
I promise!

1:19:25.867 --> 1:19:26.824
Come on.

1:19:26.910 --> 1:19:29.368
(serious music)

1:19:47.513 --> 1:19:50.514
(knocking on door)

1:19:50.557 --> 1:19:51.348
Ian?

1:19:51.391 --> 1:19:52.265
What are you doing?

1:19:52.309 --> 1:19:53.600
- Adrienne, get inside.

1:19:53.644 --> 1:19:55.310
- [Adrienne] Ian!

1:19:55.354 --> 1:19:56.394
- [Gareth] Adrienne, help!

1:19:56.438 --> 1:19:57.437
- [Ian] You're alone?

1:19:58.732 --> 1:19:58.814
- [Adrienne] Yeah, but
Gareth left a note!

1:19:59.733 --> 1:19:59.773
- You need to come in here.

1:20:00.400 --> 1:20:00.440
Just listen to me!

1:20:01.109 --> 1:20:01.274
(muffled screaming)

1:20:02.152 --> 1:20:02.692
You just need to listen to me.

1:20:02.736 --> 1:20:04.402
- Oh my god.

1:20:04.446 --> 1:20:07.279
Gareth.

1:20:07.323 --> 1:20:08.364
Emily!

1:20:09.367 --> 1:20:10.241
Oh my god!

1:20:10.284 --> 1:20:11.200
- Gareth drugged her.

1:20:12.370 --> 1:20:13.244
- Why?
- No!

1:20:13.287 --> 1:20:14.495
- I was worried about you.

1:20:14.539 --> 1:20:15.412
I went to your house.

1:20:15.456 --> 1:20:16.539
I walked up to the front door,

1:20:16.582 --> 1:20:19.124
and I saw this bastard

1:20:19.335 --> 1:20:22.503
carrying Emily's limp
body in his arms.

1:20:22.547 --> 1:20:24.797
I thought she was
dead, Adrienne.

1:20:24.841 --> 1:20:26.924
- Why wouldn't
you stop him, Ian?

1:20:26.968 --> 1:20:28.341
- I thought you
were in the house.

1:20:28.385 --> 1:20:29.384
I went in there
searching for you.

1:20:29.427 --> 1:20:30.260
I looked everywhere!

1:20:31.346 --> 1:20:31.386
I thought that he
killed you too!

1:20:32.639 --> 1:20:35.265
And then I found the
note and I came here.

1:20:35.308 --> 1:20:36.641
I tried to warn you, Adrienne.

1:20:36.685 --> 1:20:38.351
I tried to warn you.

1:20:41.231 --> 1:20:42.397
- Ian.

1:20:44.943 --> 1:20:46.359
I am so sorry.

1:20:46.403 --> 1:20:48.695
(tense music)

1:20:54.243 --> 1:20:55.534
Ian.

1:20:55.578 --> 1:21:00.080
(Gareth grunts)
(suspenseful music)

1:21:01.625 --> 1:21:03.458
I'm calling the police.

1:21:03.502 --> 1:21:04.501
- No, wait!
(muffled screaming)

1:21:04.545 --> 1:21:05.294
No no no, wait wait.

1:21:05.337 --> 1:21:06.378
No, you can't, okay?

1:21:07.464 --> 1:21:08.547
No, he's gonna
blame it all on me.

1:21:08.591 --> 1:21:09.631
- I will tell the truth!

1:21:09.675 --> 1:21:12.758
- No, no, you can't do that.

1:21:12.802 --> 1:21:13.467
Okay, it'll be his
word against mine.

1:21:13.511 --> 1:21:14.510
No, you can't.

1:21:15.847 --> 1:21:17.513
- Well then what can I do?

1:21:19.350 --> 1:21:21.642
Look, I just want
this all to end.

1:21:21.686 --> 1:21:24.312
(twisted music)

1:21:28.359 --> 1:21:30.401
(muffled screaming)

1:21:30.445 --> 1:21:31.693
- Adrienne, no!
- Adrienne.

1:21:34.406 --> 1:21:35.405
- What?

1:21:36.867 --> 1:21:38.658
- Look, it'll be self-defense.

1:21:38.702 --> 1:21:40.452
I'll be your witness.

1:21:40.537 --> 1:21:41.286
- No.

1:21:42.456 --> 1:21:43.788
- Adrienne.
- No!

1:21:43.832 --> 1:21:45.332
- Look at what he did to Emily.

1:21:46.335 --> 1:21:47.500
- [Gareth] I didn't do that!

1:21:48.795 --> 1:21:50.670
- Ramona may never wake up.

1:21:51.840 --> 1:21:54.340
Adrienne, if I didn't stop him,

1:21:55.509 --> 1:21:57.009
he would've killed
you right here.

1:21:57.053 --> 1:21:58.802
- No!
- Adrienne!

1:21:58.846 --> 1:22:00.429
He's a murderer!
- No!

1:22:00.473 --> 1:22:02.139
- [Gareth] I wouldn't
do that to you!

1:22:02.183 --> 1:22:03.182
- What are you waiting for?

1:22:06.437 --> 1:22:07.144
- I'm sorry.

1:22:08.814 --> 1:22:09.855
- Do it!

1:22:09.899 --> 1:22:12.524
(dramatic music)

1:22:16.071 --> 1:22:19.072
(muffled screaming)

1:22:20.742 --> 1:22:21.574
God!

1:22:23.119 --> 1:22:24.535
You know, I am so disappointed!

1:22:25.747 --> 1:22:28.247
I thought there was
something between us.

1:22:29.793 --> 1:22:31.918
Ah, but you know, I was
just probably being naive,

1:22:31.962 --> 1:22:32.418
like always.

1:22:35.382 --> 1:22:36.713
(Adrienne screams)

1:22:36.757 --> 1:22:39.341
(muffled screaming)

1:22:39.385 --> 1:22:40.467
- What?

1:22:40.511 --> 1:22:41.385
Oh my god.

1:22:41.428 --> 1:22:42.219
- Aw.

1:22:43.055 --> 1:22:45.305
Yeah, it was a test.

1:22:45.349 --> 1:22:46.431
And guess what?

1:22:46.475 --> 1:22:47.224
You failed.

1:22:48.394 --> 1:22:49.351
- [Gareth] Run!

1:22:49.395 --> 1:22:50.560
Run now!

1:22:50.604 --> 1:22:52.729
- He stole the love of my life.

1:22:53.774 --> 1:22:57.733
All Diana wanted to
do was please him.

1:22:57.777 --> 1:22:59.986
Yeah, that's why she did
that impossible stunt.

1:23:01.990 --> 1:23:04.407
And who got the blame
for it, huh, who, who?

1:23:05.576 --> 1:23:07.368
Yep, not this guy.

1:23:07.412 --> 1:23:10.538
Then, you know, Carly, she
started flirting with me.

1:23:10.581 --> 1:23:12.581
Yeah, well, anyway, Gareth,

1:23:12.625 --> 1:23:15.084
uh, you know, I just
figured tit for tat.

1:23:15.128 --> 1:23:16.627
- You killed Carly!
- So you killed her?

1:23:16.671 --> 1:23:17.336
(muffled screaming)

1:23:17.380 --> 1:23:18.962
You killed Carly?

1:23:19.006 --> 1:23:19.587
- What do you
think you're doing?

1:23:20.799 --> 1:23:21.006
- [Ian] Yes, Adrienne,
I killed Carly.

1:23:21.550 --> 1:23:22.257
(Gareth screams)

1:23:23.552 --> 1:23:23.591
- [Carly] I'm not having
this conversation.

1:23:24.678 --> 1:23:24.718
- [Ian] Now he
knows what it's like

1:23:26.054 --> 1:23:26.636
to lose someone you love
and get blamed for it!

1:23:28.890 --> 1:23:30.265
- [Adrienne] And
Phil Navarro too?

1:23:30.308 --> 1:23:31.307
- Oh.

1:23:31.351 --> 1:23:32.517
(Gareth screams)

1:23:32.561 --> 1:23:35.103
No choice, a loose end.
(sharp thudding)

1:23:35.147 --> 1:23:35.770
(Gareth screams)

1:23:37.065 --> 1:23:37.397
Fortunately, Nikki
Leone came to the rescue

1:23:38.692 --> 1:23:40.524
and pinned another
murder on my old friend.

1:23:40.568 --> 1:23:43.235
You know, if Gareth had just
gotten in the car that night

1:23:43.279 --> 1:23:44.236
instead of you,

1:23:45.865 --> 1:23:46.947
it all would've been wrapped
up in a tight little bow.

1:23:48.284 --> 1:23:49.450
And then there was you.

1:23:50.286 --> 1:23:51.118
You.

1:23:51.162 --> 1:23:51.827
(car horn honking)

1:23:52.788 --> 1:23:53.037
All you wanted to do was just

1:23:53.914 --> 1:23:55.122
(crashing)
protect him,

1:23:55.166 --> 1:23:57.249
save his name, clear
his reputation!

1:23:58.169 --> 1:23:59.710
- But why seduce me?

1:24:00.629 --> 1:24:01.336
- Adrienne!

1:24:03.590 --> 1:24:04.505
Isn't it obvious?

1:24:04.549 --> 1:24:06.466
Trust, loyalty.

1:24:06.509 --> 1:24:08.760
You know, I wanted you to
believe me, not this guy.

1:24:15.310 --> 1:24:18.186
- I never really
trusted you, Ian.

1:24:19.481 --> 1:24:21.481
- What are you talking about?

1:24:21.524 --> 1:24:22.815
- Gareth's SUV,

1:24:24.651 --> 1:24:26.526
it never left his garage.

1:24:26.570 --> 1:24:28.320
It didn't even have
a scratch on it.

1:24:29.323 --> 1:24:30.155
The note,

1:24:31.283 --> 1:24:33.241
maybe the guy that
I thought I knew

1:24:34.286 --> 1:24:35.368
really did lose his mind.

1:24:38.499 --> 1:24:41.124
Do you have any idea
how many love letters

1:24:41.168 --> 1:24:43.376
Gareth wrote to me when
we were still together?

1:24:43.420 --> 1:24:46.087
Letters that I've still
kept all these years later.

1:24:48.424 --> 1:24:50.633
Gareth wrote in all caps, Ian.

1:24:52.553 --> 1:24:54.178
It's all those little details.

1:24:55.932 --> 1:25:00.768
So I called Nikki Leone,
told her everything,

1:25:00.812 --> 1:25:02.728
knowing that she would
jump at the chance to cover

1:25:02.772 --> 1:25:04.563
the final chapter

1:25:04.607 --> 1:25:07.857
in Hollywood's most
talked-about murder mystery,

1:25:07.901 --> 1:25:08.817
live.

1:25:11.780 --> 1:25:15.323
Say hello to Nikki Leone
and her 50 million fans.

1:25:19.246 --> 1:25:20.662
We're live, remember.

1:25:21.498 --> 1:25:23.289
Don't get shy on me.

1:25:24.376 --> 1:25:25.208
- No.

1:25:27.212 --> 1:25:29.753
(sirens wailing)

1:25:29.797 --> 1:25:31.505
(Gareth shouts)
(body thuds)

1:25:31.549 --> 1:25:32.756
(sirens wailing)
(tires squealing)

1:25:32.800 --> 1:25:34.424
(punching)
(grunting)

1:25:34.468 --> 1:25:36.969
(Gareth groans)

1:25:38.389 --> 1:25:39.471
- Police!

1:25:41.684 --> 1:25:42.391
- Okay.

1:25:44.520 --> 1:25:45.310
- You're fine, you're fine.

1:25:45.437 --> 1:25:48.147
(troubled music)

1:25:49.399 --> 1:25:51.315
(Ian grunts)

1:25:51.359 --> 1:25:52.358
- Emily.

1:25:52.402 --> 1:25:54.735
(weighty music)
