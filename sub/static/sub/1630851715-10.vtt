34:50.175 --> 34:51.524
I KILLED SOMEONE.

34:51.567 --> 34:54.179
POISON IVY KILLED SOMEONE,

34:54.222 --> 34:56.050
AND NOW SHE'S GONE.

34:57.312 --> 34:59.140
AND MARY'S BACK.

35:01.882 --> 35:03.362
YEAH.

35:18.377 --> 35:22.120
YOU CAME BACK TO GOTHAM
BECAUSE YOU CARE ABOUT HER.

35:22.163 --> 35:23.817
I'M SORRY. WHO ARE
WE TALKING ABOUT?

35:23.860 --> 35:26.950

A PART OF YOU LOVED

35:26.994 --> 35:28.909
EVERY SECOND OF IT,

35:28.952 --> 35:30.345
YOU STILL FEEL GUILTY
FOR CHANGING HER

35:30.389 --> 35:33.479

WITH THE MAYOR
FOR MY FREEDOM.

35:45.969 --> 35:49.103
