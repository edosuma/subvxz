00:01.201 --> 00:03.503
Please. Oh, please, please, please, please.

00:03.504 --> 00:04.471
No.

00:04.471 --> 00:06.005
How many times do I have to tell you

00:06.006 --> 00:08.674
I will not flamenco dance
at the coffee house.

00:08.675 --> 00:10.776
But I need an act to fill
up my Friday night showcase.

00:10.777 --> 00:12.812
And when you twirl
in your red ruffled skirt

00:12.813 --> 00:15.014
you look so Rico Suave.

00:15.015 --> 00:16.949
Sorry, seĂąorita, but I quit flamenco

00:16.950 --> 00:20.052
when Queen Isabella caught me
fandangoing with Ferdinand.

00:20.053 --> 00:22.288
All right, how about a hula?

00:22.289 --> 00:23.456
A hora?

00:23.457 --> 00:24.624
A Mexican hat dance?

00:24.625 --> 00:27.126
I'll slip a flask of tequila
in your sombrero.

00:27.127 --> 00:29.495
I'm late for my gamma ray graduate seminar.

00:29.496 --> 00:31.764
Find another sucker.

00:33.000 --> 00:34.133

00:38.238 --> 00:39.172

00:39.173 --> 00:41.307
You are not singing at the coffee house.

00:41.308 --> 00:42.441
Okay.

00:42.442 --> 00:44.310
How about comedy? How about juggling?

00:44.311 --> 00:45.511
How about putting a sock in it?

00:45.512 --> 00:46.579
That's it.

00:46.580 --> 00:47.847
I'll be a mime.

00:47.848 --> 00:50.616
Want to see me do my "trapped in a box"?

00:50.617 --> 00:53.219
I thought you'd never ask.

Roxie, what are you doing here?

01:41.868 --> 01:43.936
Metabolizing glucose.

01:43.937 --> 01:45.571
I didn't know you were into journalism.

01:45.572 --> 01:47.907
Well, maybe if we ever
had a real conversation.

01:47.908 --> 01:49.742
Why spoil what works?

01:49.743 --> 01:52.845
I have to get over this whole
functional behavior kick.

01:52.846 --> 01:54.347
So what do you want to do
for the school paper?

01:54.348 --> 01:55.514
The same kind of hard-hitting reporting

01:55.515 --> 01:57.016
I did for my high school newspaper.

01:57.017 --> 01:58.618
I did an expose on two seniors

01:58.619 --> 02:00.753
that turned out to be white supremacists.

02:00.754 --> 02:02.922
Oh, well, I uncovered a car-jacking ring

02:02.923 --> 02:04.056
that was working football games.

02:04.057 --> 02:06.959
And I busted the cafeteria
for selling expired yogurt.

02:06.960 --> 02:08.060
Expired yogurt?

02:08.061 --> 02:09.362
Yeah, have you ever tasted a carton

02:09.363 --> 02:10.795
of moldy strawberry peach?

02:10.797 --> 02:13.332
Everybody sit down so we can get started.

02:14.268 --> 02:16.469
Okay, you're all here
because you want to write

02:16.470 --> 02:17.603
for the Adams Advocate.

02:17.604 --> 02:18.771
If you want to write

02:18.772 --> 02:20.606
you have to bring me stories

02:20.607 --> 02:22.642
that are provocative and different.

02:22.643 --> 02:25.211
Most of you will just be
pestering small businesses

02:25.212 --> 02:26.412
to buy ad space.

02:26.413 --> 02:27.713
I didn't come to college

02:27.714 --> 02:29.849
to solicit nail salons and pizza joints.

02:29.850 --> 02:33.119
I didn't fight the war on yogurt
to wind up with a desk job.

02:33.120 --> 02:36.489
The two of you are already
planning your first article.

02:36.490 --> 02:38.491
Why don't you chatterboxes team up?

02:38.492 --> 02:40.292
Actually, I prefer to write solo.

02:40.293 --> 02:41.927
I prefer she write solo, too.

02:41.928 --> 02:44.363
Everyone will be writing with a partner.

02:44.364 --> 02:45.098
The two best stories

02:45.099 --> 02:47.099
go in the paper.

02:47.100 --> 02:49.502
The rest will go in the trash.

02:49.503 --> 02:50.803
Well, if it's any consolation

02:50.804 --> 02:53.572
I heard that Woodward didn't
like working with Bernstein.

02:53.573 --> 02:55.841
It's not consolation whatsoever.

02:56.811 --> 02:58.044
( bongos playing )

02:58.045 --> 03:02.348
The endless cycle of naked
truth spins yellow.

03:02.349 --> 03:03.482
Madness!

03:03.483 --> 03:06.352
It's like crazy, man.

03:06.353 --> 03:08.688
Salem, what are you doing here?

03:08.689 --> 03:09.989
Auditioning.

03:09.990 --> 03:12.091
I can't have cats in the coffee house.

03:12.092 --> 03:13.993
But I'm a hep cat.

03:13.994 --> 03:16.429
I hang out in the coffee
houses all the time.

03:16.430 --> 03:18.030
You dig?

03:20.200 --> 03:22.868
That's deep, daddy-o.

03:24.705 --> 03:25.971
Okay, here's our article.

03:25.972 --> 03:27.873
We go to the Adams College Arts Festival

03:27.874 --> 03:29.241
and we interview one of the potters.

03:29.242 --> 03:31.944
There's a news flash-- clay.

03:31.945 --> 03:33.379
Right.

03:33.380 --> 03:34.480
Okay, how about this?

03:34.481 --> 03:37.116
We do a story on the lack
of public transportation.

03:37.117 --> 03:38.085
I mean, there are never enough buses

03:38.086 --> 03:41.320
to get the students
from campus to downtown.

03:41.321 --> 03:43.923
Listen to me-- I'm pitching
a story about buses.

03:43.924 --> 03:45.257
I've got it.

03:45.258 --> 03:47.426
The pervasive paranoia and depression

03:47.427 --> 03:48.594
in American society

03:48.595 --> 03:50.730
vis-a-vis the end of human existence

03:50.731 --> 03:51.997
as we know it.

03:51.998 --> 03:53.999
Too light and bubbly.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.135
Hilda: Mr. Wayne Newton, please.

03:56.136 --> 03:59.872
Hilda of Hilda's Coffee House.

03:59.873 --> 04:01.240
Yes, I'll hold.

04:01.241 --> 04:03.109
Danke schoen.

04:03.244 --> 04:04.643
This is going to be so fabulous.

04:04.644 --> 04:07.980
Everybody loves Wayne Newton.

04:07.981 --> 04:11.117
What do you mean he's out of town...
forever?

04:11.118 --> 04:12.818
You tell that pompadoured lounge lizard

04:12.819 --> 04:14.487
that he is no Paul Anka.

04:14.488 --> 04:16.622
And that I'm never having his baby.

04:18.190 --> 04:19.059
Who am I going to get now?

04:19.060 --> 04:20.493
( Salem meows )

04:20.494 --> 04:22.828
âŞ I'm the cat in the tutti-frutti hat âŞ

04:22.829 --> 04:25.464
âŞ All the pretty
senoritas go for that âŞ

04:25.465 --> 04:27.166
♪ Ay-yi-yi-yi-yi... ♪

04:27.167 --> 04:29.668
( with Cuban accent ): Lucy,
how many times I have to tell you--

04:29.669 --> 04:31.103
you can't be in the show.

04:31.104 --> 04:33.506
( imitating Lucy ): But, Ricky!

04:33.507 --> 04:34.540
Salem, you really think

04:34.541 --> 04:36.008
college girls are going to go for cats

04:36.009 --> 04:37.643
in South American drag?

04:37.644 --> 04:39.278
I do all right.

04:39.279 --> 04:40.279
Now be honest--

04:40.280 --> 04:43.082
am I any worse than the other
acts you saw today?

04:43.083 --> 04:44.817
No, and you were definitely better

04:44.818 --> 04:46.452
than the gangsta gynecologist

04:46.453 --> 04:48.020
but I still can't book you.

04:48.021 --> 04:49.688
Don't want to book me.

04:49.689 --> 04:51.290
Don't split hairs, okay?

04:51.291 --> 04:54.460
I still have a headache
from Notorious G.Y.N.

04:55.296 --> 04:57.630
Aunt Zelda, Roxie and I have
to write a hot article

04:57.631 --> 04:58.465
for the Adams Advocate.

04:58.465 --> 04:59.432
Any ideas?

04:59.432 --> 05:00.200
As a matter of fact

05:00.201 --> 05:01.801
I just heard something very exciting.

05:01.802 --> 05:03.002
I knew you'd be a big help.

05:03.003 --> 05:04.403
New measurements of deuterium

05:04.404 --> 05:05.838
at the center of the Milky Way

05:05.839 --> 05:08.440
confirm theoretical models that deuterium

05:08.441 --> 05:10.009
a heavy isotope of hydrogen

05:10.010 --> 05:12.311
containing one proton and one neutron

05:12.312 --> 05:14.713
is primordial.

05:14.714 --> 05:17.283
That's been done to death.

05:18.186 --> 05:19.618
So what did your aunt say?

05:19.619 --> 05:22.454
Let's just be glad we're
not in her Physics class.

05:22.455 --> 05:24.123
Let's face it, we have no story.

05:24.124 --> 05:25.758
We're never going to get on the paper.

05:25.759 --> 05:27.126
Okay, Bye.

05:27.127 --> 05:27.561
Out of my way.

05:27.562 --> 05:29.295
I am late for something important.

05:29.296 --> 05:30.030
Let me guess--

05:30.031 --> 05:32.531
emergency mustache bleaching?

05:32.532 --> 05:33.732
Don't be ridiculous.

05:34.067 --> 05:35.067
Pumpkin facial.

05:35.635 --> 05:36.203
All the rushees

05:36.204 --> 05:38.270
in my sorority are giving
them to the actives.

05:38.271 --> 05:40.406
Then they're polishing our pearls.

05:40.407 --> 05:42.808
Don't you hate being saddled with a brain?

05:42.809 --> 05:43.176
Wait a minute.

05:43.177 --> 05:44.810
That's it. That's our article.

05:44.811 --> 05:45.579
Smart people?

05:45.580 --> 05:47.112
No, no, no, no. Sororities.

05:47.113 --> 05:48.048
Shallow people.

05:48.049 --> 05:49.348
Right. And yet most girls

05:49.349 --> 05:51.684
would do anything to join a sorority.

05:51.685 --> 05:54.186
Why would shallow people
want to connect so badly

05:54.187 --> 05:55.554
with other shallow people?

05:55.555 --> 05:57.590
We'll ask Morgan the next time we see her.

05:57.591 --> 05:58.458
You don't get it.

05:58.459 --> 06:02.458
Our story is-- "Sorority
Girls-- Society's Lost Souls."

06:03.029 --> 06:06.432
Pampered... pearls... pathetic.

06:06.433 --> 06:07.499
I like it.

06:07.500 --> 06:07.934
Thank you.

06:07.935 --> 06:09.335
Here's what I propose.

06:09.336 --> 06:11.003
We get the scoop by going undercover

06:11.004 --> 06:13.172
as sorority rushees.

06:13.173 --> 06:15.241
Me in a sweater set and pleated skirt?

06:15.242 --> 06:17.610
I can't think of anything more ridiculous.

06:19.412 --> 06:22.615
Don't you dare tell anyone you
ever saw me in a sweater set.

06:22.616 --> 06:25.351
Okay, but it's going to cost you.

06:25.352 --> 06:27.119
Cute outfit.

06:27.120 --> 06:29.922
Great. They think I'm one of them.

06:29.923 --> 06:31.724
Good. Now let's see
if we can sound like them.

06:31.725 --> 06:33.058
Talk about your summer.

06:33.059 --> 06:34.526
I got Lyme disease.

06:34.527 --> 06:35.995
We're gonna have to work on that.

06:36.063 --> 06:39.632
Hi. I'm Mindy Shivley,
Rush Chairman for Mu Pi.

06:40.034 --> 06:41.066

06:41.067 --> 06:42.902
Hi. I'm Roxie. This is Sabrina

06:42.903 --> 06:43.637
We're so incredibly excited

06:43.638 --> 06:45.070
to be here and meet you

06:45.071 --> 06:46.672
and meet everybody and say hello

06:46.673 --> 06:48.941
and see the house and rush,
and gosh, it's all so exciting.

06:48.942 --> 06:50.409
I don't know what to say.

06:50.410 --> 06:52.278
Uh, maybe you should take it down a notch.

06:52.279 --> 06:54.747
( chimes )

06:54.748 --> 06:56.048
Hey, Sabrina.

06:56.049 --> 06:57.883
I'm glad you decided to rush.

06:57.884 --> 06:59.318
Oh, what are you doing here?

06:59.319 --> 07:02.488
Believe me, I'm asking
myself the same question.

07:02.489 --> 07:03.589
What she means is, she can't wait

07:03.590 --> 07:06.292
for the first pajama party.

07:06.293 --> 07:08.193
Could I please have everyone's attention?

07:08.194 --> 07:10.529
I'd like to welcome all the rushees.

07:10.530 --> 07:11.697
That's us. Look alive.

07:11.698 --> 07:13.165
And a special thanks

07:13.166 --> 07:13.934
to Hope and Bethany

07:13.935 --> 07:15.334
for providing these delicious

07:15.335 --> 07:18.570
but oh-so-naughty cinnamon snaps.

07:18.906 --> 07:20.272
Ooh, suck-ups.

07:20.273 --> 07:21.440
Why didn't we think of that?

07:21.441 --> 07:23.342
And now, to get us into the Mu Pi spirit

07:23.343 --> 07:25.811
why don't we all sing the Mu Pi song?

07:25.812 --> 07:27.346
I'd rather have a colonoscopy.

07:27.347 --> 07:29.815
I think they save that for the big
Spring Mixer.

07:30.584 --> 07:34.520

I'm putting you in Friday night at 9:15.

07:51.304 --> 07:52.438
Maybe 9:20.

07:52.439 --> 07:55.107
It depends when the Israeli guy
finishes reading Jabberwocky.

07:55.108 --> 07:57.276
That's great, but I can't agree to anything

07:57.277 --> 07:59.044
until you talk to my agent.

07:59.680 --> 08:02.448
Salem Saberhagen, C.A.T.?

08:02.449 --> 08:04.316
"Creative Acts and Talent."

08:04.317 --> 08:05.784
He's handling a lot of performers

08:05.785 --> 08:06.986
from the other realm.

08:06.987 --> 08:08.954
Salem is a convicted felon.

08:08.955 --> 08:10.489
He can't be an agent.

08:10.490 --> 08:12.324
Well, I suppose he could.

08:12.325 --> 08:14.560
I really think Salem's going
to boost my career.

08:14.561 --> 08:17.129
Maybe you'll be the next Morty Ponder?

08:17.130 --> 08:17.797
Who?

08:17.798 --> 08:19.264
Exactly.

08:20.034 --> 08:21.567
These cinnamon snaps are awesome.

08:21.568 --> 08:22.701
Enough with the cookies.

08:22.702 --> 08:24.103
We've got an article to write.

08:24.104 --> 08:25.537
Let's go expose some airheads.

08:25.538 --> 08:26.605
Let's do sound check.

08:26.606 --> 08:28.440
Testing one, two, three.

08:28.441 --> 08:29.708
Four, five six.

08:29.709 --> 08:30.709
We're live.

08:30.710 --> 08:32.244
Victoria's got a new secret.

08:32.245 --> 08:32.979
Let's split up.

08:32.979 --> 08:33.712
Roger that.

08:33.714 --> 08:36.248
But lets meet at the cinnamon
snaps in an hour.

08:36.249 --> 08:39.118
Will you stop with the cinnamon snaps?

08:41.121 --> 08:43.022
Hi. I'm Sabrina.

08:43.023 --> 08:43.823
I'm Lynn.

08:43.823 --> 08:45.824
Are you as excited as I am
at rushing Mu Pi?

08:45.825 --> 08:46.760
Ecstatic.

08:46.761 --> 08:48.427
I hear more Mu Pi's graduate

08:48.428 --> 08:51.630
with engagement rings than any other house.

08:51.631 --> 08:53.232
That's why you're here?

08:53.233 --> 08:54.433
To meet a husband?

08:54.434 --> 08:56.301
Yeah, aren't you?

08:56.302 --> 08:58.837
No. My education comes first.

08:58.838 --> 08:59.806
I want to do well in school

08:59.807 --> 09:01.240
so I can have a successful career.

09:01.241 --> 09:02.908
Which will make you even more attractive

09:02.909 --> 09:04.510
to your future husband.

09:04.511 --> 09:06.412
I don't mean to sound judgmental

09:06.413 --> 09:09.181
but isn't that a little shallow?

09:10.784 --> 09:11.984
So, long story short--

09:11.985 --> 09:13.652
my parents and I argued all year

09:13.653 --> 09:15.320
about which Mercedes they should buy me.

09:15.321 --> 09:17.089
I'm sure you can relate.

09:17.090 --> 09:18.757
Actually, I'm on a scholarship.

09:18.758 --> 09:20.125
I live at home and take the bus

09:20.126 --> 09:21.226
which isn't bad

09:21.227 --> 09:23.362
but sometimes there's a bus shortage.

09:23.363 --> 09:24.897
Bus shortage?

09:24.898 --> 09:28.898
A smart person would have
written an article about that.

09:29.135 --> 09:30.736
So what are you looking forward to most

09:30.737 --> 09:32.037
about being a Mu Pi?

09:32.038 --> 09:33.806
Like, doing your toenails
with the other girls

09:33.807 --> 09:35.741
or highlighting each other's hair?

09:35.742 --> 09:37.176
Actually, I want to get involved

09:37.177 --> 09:39.611
in their Volunteer America program.

09:39.612 --> 09:41.847
Oh, where you volunteer to give manicures

09:41.848 --> 09:43.415
to the less fortunate?

09:43.416 --> 09:47.416
Um, no, where they feed
the homeless and read to the blind.

09:48.054 --> 09:50.189
I was afraid of that.

09:50.190 --> 09:51.690
So you're into horses?

09:51.691 --> 09:52.825
There's a surprise.

09:52.826 --> 09:54.893
I'll bet you've got the boots, the jodhpurs

09:54.894 --> 09:56.595
and that little whippy thing.

09:56.596 --> 09:59.698
No, I intern doing
equestrian riding therapy

09:59.699 --> 10:02.067
for disabled children.

10:02.068 --> 10:04.670
But you wear a silly bonnet, right?

10:04.671 --> 10:05.904
Come on...

10:05.905 --> 10:07.206
give me something.

10:07.207 --> 10:09.975
I've got nothing here.

10:12.912 --> 10:14.279
Boy, are we out of luck.

10:14.280 --> 10:15.280
Tell me about it.

10:15.281 --> 10:16.882
This is the last cinnamon snap

10:16.883 --> 10:19.017
and Bethany is not parting
with that recipe.

10:19.018 --> 10:20.652
I'm talking about the story.

10:20.653 --> 10:21.387
We don't have one.

10:21.388 --> 10:22.721
These girls are great.

10:22.722 --> 10:24.490
What they do is great.

10:24.491 --> 10:26.225
So we'll do a different story.

10:26.226 --> 10:27.726
We'll write about how nice and sweet

10:27.727 --> 10:29.328
these sorority girls really are.

10:29.329 --> 10:31.630
I'd rather solicit pizza parlors.

10:31.631 --> 10:33.632
You may get your wish.

10:35.768 --> 10:36.736
It was nice meeting you, two.

10:36.737 --> 10:38.470
I guess I'll see you
both on Thursday night.

10:38.471 --> 10:39.771
Oh, what's Thursday night?

10:39.772 --> 10:41.507
Study night. We meet here at 8:00.

10:41.508 --> 10:42.275
How precious.

10:42.276 --> 10:43.909
We all get together and do our homework.

10:43.910 --> 10:46.478
Oh not quite. we all get together
and do the senior's homework.

10:46.479 --> 10:48.714
What? Isn't that cheating?

10:48.715 --> 10:51.116
If you don't do it, you
don't get into Mu Pi.

10:51.117 --> 10:54.319
Bye.

10:54.320 --> 10:57.456
I think we got our story.

11:00.960 --> 11:03.929
A homework cheating ring?
This is big.

11:03.930 --> 11:06.365
This is really big-- like really,
really, really, really big.

11:06.366 --> 11:09.468
FYI, when we write the article,
I'm in charge of adjectives.

11:09.469 --> 11:11.503
This is huge. We're talking
front-page stuff here.

11:11.504 --> 11:12.771
I mean, with this article

11:12.772 --> 11:14.740
we could change the course of history.

11:14.741 --> 11:17.242
Newsman: It's News On the March.

11:17.243 --> 11:20.112
World menace taken down!

11:20.514 --> 11:23.048
Sabrina Spellman and Roxie
King win the Pulitzer Prize

11:23.049 --> 11:26.185
for blowing the lid
off decades-old cheating ring.

11:26.186 --> 11:27.653
We caught these dames red-handed.

11:27.654 --> 11:29.655
It's bye-bye, Mu Pi.

11:29.656 --> 11:32.057
Say, fellas, get a load of these gams.

11:32.426 --> 11:34.426
Roxie: Sabrina, is there
any particular reason

11:34.427 --> 11:36.028
you're showing me your thighs?

11:36.029 --> 11:39.598
Oh, uh... yeah, I've been working
out a lot lately.

11:39.599 --> 11:41.366
Let's start working
out our plan to bust Mu Pi.

11:41.367 --> 11:43.302
All we have now is hearsay.

11:43.303 --> 11:45.003
True. We will not be able to write word one

11:45.004 --> 11:48.273
until we have evidence,
witnesses and quotes.

11:48.274 --> 11:49.441
So our mission on Thursday

11:49.442 --> 11:51.176
is to come back and gather
all the hard facts.

11:51.177 --> 11:53.011
Yeah. We'll call on the boys
from the precinct.

11:53.012 --> 11:54.379
We'll throw these peaches in a paddy wagon

11:54.380 --> 11:56.815
and you and I'll put on the Ritz
and paint this town red.

11:56.816 --> 11:58.483
I'll tell you what-- I'll do the writing

11:58.484 --> 12:00.586
you jitterbug for the troops.

12:01.488 --> 12:04.790
Hilda, sweetheart, I love
you, you know that

12:04.791 --> 12:07.292
but I only have so much wiggle
room on this guitarist.

12:07.293 --> 12:09.795
I'm getting pressured from all sides.

12:09.796 --> 12:10.929
What sides?!

12:10.930 --> 12:12.664
It's you and a couple of business cards

12:12.665 --> 12:14.566
you printed up at Kinko's.

12:14.567 --> 12:16.034
Why do you even want to be an agent anyway?

12:16.035 --> 12:17.469
You wouldn't let me perform

12:17.470 --> 12:20.038
so now I have to sponge
off the talent of others.

12:20.039 --> 12:22.741
My client gets ten grand
a night, take it or leave it.

12:22.742 --> 12:24.309
It's a showcase.

12:24.310 --> 12:27.512
Performers work for tips!
Okay!

12:27.513 --> 12:29.715
300 bucks and pound of lox.

12:29.716 --> 12:32.718
Two bucks and a can of Starkist,
and that is my final offer.

12:32.719 --> 12:35.821
Shh! I'm on the phone with the coast.

12:35.822 --> 12:39.091
Jeffrey! Steven? David?!

12:39.092 --> 12:43.528
I can't believe I got all three of you
boychicks on the line!

12:43.529 --> 12:44.663
There's no one on the line.

12:44.664 --> 12:46.765
At the end of the day,
who's going to remember?

12:46.766 --> 12:49.001
I will. I have had it with you!

12:49.002 --> 12:50.269
I've had it with you!

12:50.270 --> 12:52.204
I've had it with both of you.

12:52.205 --> 12:52.739
This has gone on

12:52.740 --> 12:54.206
long enough.

12:54.207 --> 12:55.907
Okay, here's the deal.

12:55.908 --> 12:58.010
Your guitarist gets ten bucks a show.

12:58.011 --> 13:00.245
Salem gets a fish stick.

13:00.246 --> 13:02.547
If it's a packed house,
a side of tartar sauce.

13:02.548 --> 13:03.216
Fine.

13:03.217 --> 13:05.751
All right. Let's close this thing.

13:05.752 --> 13:08.987
I've got a lunch with the Budweiser ferret.

13:13.660 --> 13:14.960
Did you put in fresh batteries?

13:14.961 --> 13:16.962
Yeah, I'm packing two Ds, and believe me

13:16.963 --> 13:19.131
that is the first time I've ever said that.

13:19.132 --> 13:20.799
Hey, Sabrina. Hey, Roxie.

13:20.800 --> 13:22.067
Welcome to study night.

13:22.068 --> 13:23.135
Here are your assignments.

13:23.136 --> 13:24.770
Sabrina, you're going to be
doing Karen's homework.

13:24.771 --> 13:26.672
Roxie, you're going to be doing mine.

13:26.673 --> 13:28.674
But I don't know anything
about the Punic Wars.

13:28.675 --> 13:29.841
Neither do I.

13:29.842 --> 13:31.443
That's why we keep a comprehensive file

13:31.444 --> 13:33.312
of all the papers ever written at Adams.

13:33.313 --> 13:35.847
Um, so what you're saying, Mindy T.
Sheibley

13:35.848 --> 13:39.084
is that in order for us
to become Mu Pi members

13:39.085 --> 13:41.620
( clicking ) we have to do your...

13:41.621 --> 13:43.322
What's that?
What?

13:43.323 --> 13:46.258
That clicking-- it sounds
like it's coming from your top.

13:46.259 --> 13:50.262
Uh, it is... coming from my top... jaw.

13:50.263 --> 13:51.730
I have click-jaw.

13:51.731 --> 13:54.299
In high school, they used
to call me "Click-jaw McGraw."

13:56.169 --> 13:58.704
Now, back to us doing... your homework.

13:58.705 --> 14:01.473
Yeah, Mindy T. Sheibley. Oh!

14:01.474 --> 14:02.941
What is this?

14:02.942 --> 14:04.476
Oh! Oh, my gosh!

14:04.477 --> 14:05.644
My pacemaker fell out.

14:05.645 --> 14:08.213
I am so suing that heart surgeon.

14:08.214 --> 14:09.381
It's a tape recorder.

14:09.382 --> 14:11.183
What are you doing with a tape recorder?

14:11.184 --> 14:12.051
That's a very good question.

14:12.052 --> 14:14.019
And she has a very good answer.

14:14.020 --> 14:16.154
Yeah, I do. I use it...

14:16.155 --> 14:18.824
uh, you know, in my classes
to tape my lectures.

14:18.825 --> 14:21.426
It's so small and comfortable,
I almost forget I'm wearing it.

14:21.427 --> 14:22.661
Hey, Felice, look at this.

14:22.662 --> 14:24.396
I-I know it looks strange, but...

14:24.397 --> 14:26.898
Oh, that is so adorable.

14:26.899 --> 14:28.266
Strangely adorable.

14:28.267 --> 14:29.868
I love it.

14:29.869 --> 14:31.370
And it goes with your shoes.

14:31.371 --> 14:33.438
And you never want to break up a set.

14:33.439 --> 14:34.473
Now, can you please give it back to her?

14:34.474 --> 14:36.341
Sure, right after I show it to Bethany.

14:36.342 --> 14:37.709
Check it out!

14:37.710 --> 14:40.078
Excuse me. I need that back.

14:40.079 --> 14:42.013
You know, it's not a toy.

14:42.014 --> 14:44.349
Okay, family heirloom.

14:44.350 --> 14:45.051
It's very fragile.

14:45.052 --> 14:47.786
Oh, I have to have one of these.

14:47.787 --> 14:48.388
Where's the "play" button?

14:48.389 --> 14:49.389
I want to hear how it sounds.

14:49.390 --> 14:50.589
Oh, no, you don't.

14:50.590 --> 14:52.124
Why not?
Because...

14:52.125 --> 14:53.092
Tell them, Roxie.

14:53.093 --> 14:54.726
Because if you hear what it sounds like

14:54.727 --> 14:57.462
you won't be surprised later
when you get your own.

14:57.463 --> 14:59.431
Excuse us.

14:59.432 --> 15:00.732
That was close.

15:00.733 --> 15:01.800
Are you securely fastened now?

15:01.801 --> 15:03.735
Yeah. Ready for takeoff.

15:04.204 --> 15:05.804
Hey, Lynn. Hi, Nancy.

15:05.805 --> 15:07.672
Sabrina.
How's it going?

15:07.673 --> 15:09.741
Oh, not so great-- can
you believe these girls

15:09.742 --> 15:12.511
expect us to do their homework?
It's a drag.

15:12.512 --> 15:14.045
But if we want in, we have no choice.

15:14.046 --> 15:15.447
Well, we could join a different sorority

15:15.448 --> 15:18.517
or not join one at all.
I have to join.

15:18.518 --> 15:21.353
It's the one chance I'll ever
have in life to fit in.

15:21.354 --> 15:22.587
Four generations of women

15:22.588 --> 15:24.389
in my family have been Mu Pi's.

15:24.390 --> 15:26.591
If I don't join, I'll be the black sheep.

15:26.592 --> 15:29.094
So is it fair to say
that the Mu Pi sorority

15:29.095 --> 15:31.530
is taking advantage
of your family pressure, Lynn

15:31.531 --> 15:34.866
and your total lack of self-esteem, Nancy?

15:34.867 --> 15:36.234
Well, you don't have to put it like that.

15:36.235 --> 15:38.603
Well, I just feel like doing
the Mu Pi sisters' homework

15:38.604 --> 15:41.473
is not only wrong but completely unethical.

15:41.474 --> 15:43.942
I guess, but on the upside

15:43.943 --> 15:45.410
the house does do a lot of positive work

15:45.411 --> 15:46.478
in the community.

15:46.479 --> 15:47.113
Plus, we get to make

15:47.114 --> 15:50.348
a lot of really good
friends, like you and Roxie.

15:50.349 --> 15:52.217
Me and Roxie?
Yeah.

15:52.218 --> 15:55.754
We would never have met you guys
if we hadn't decided to rush.

15:55.755 --> 15:57.322
You're really nice.

15:57.323 --> 15:59.057
I mean, you're super-nice.

15:59.058 --> 16:03.094
Thanks. I think the "super" part
might be pushing it, but...

16:03.095 --> 16:03.729
Well, you know

16:03.730 --> 16:05.330
we better get started on this homework.

16:05.331 --> 16:08.099
With any luck, I'll have time to do my own.

16:09.735 --> 16:11.136
Well, I've got all I need.

16:11.137 --> 16:13.805
Mu Pi is going to fry.

16:17.877 --> 16:20.479
This is definitely going
to put us on staff.

16:20.480 --> 16:23.849
We'll be editors by the end of the year.

16:24.551 --> 16:27.752
I don't want to write this story.

16:27.753 --> 16:29.354
What are you talking about?

16:29.355 --> 16:30.522
Well, a lot of people could get hurt

16:30.523 --> 16:31.857
or kicked out of college.

16:31.858 --> 16:34.726
I didn't hot-wire my bra so you
could back out at the last minute.

16:34.727 --> 16:36.261
This is journalism-- you write the truth

16:36.262 --> 16:37.829
and let the chips fall where they may.

16:37.830 --> 16:40.465
But what if the chips destroy somebody?

16:40.466 --> 16:41.700
I think I'm beginning to understand

16:41.701 --> 16:43.735
who Sabrina Spellman is.

16:43.736 --> 16:45.403
You can't handle the truth!

16:45.404 --> 16:47.205
I can handle the truth!

16:47.206 --> 16:48.840
I just can't handle the guilt.

16:49.710 --> 16:51.176
Roxie, We have to consider
the ramifications.

16:51.177 --> 16:53.278
These girls could get thrown out of school

16:53.279 --> 16:54.746
then their parents may
never talk to them again

16:54.747 --> 16:55.881
and then what's going
to happen to the kids?

16:55.882 --> 16:58.850
I mean, you saw Girl,
Interrupted-- murder, mayhem

16:58.851 --> 17:00.886
major box office disappointment.

17:00.887 --> 17:03.188
I'm sure there's a valid
point in there somewhere.

17:03.189 --> 17:05.423
On the other hand, if we want
to be responsible journalists

17:05.424 --> 17:06.625
we have to make the tough calls.

17:06.626 --> 17:08.693
Whatever call we make,
we better do it fast.

17:08.694 --> 17:09.694
We've got a deadline.

17:09.694 --> 17:10.762
But if we don't write the article

17:10.762 --> 17:13.064
we could wake up one day with no careers

17:13.065 --> 17:14.900
living in lousy apartments
and kick ourselves

17:14.901 --> 17:17.167
for not taking advantage
of a great opportunity.

17:17.169 --> 17:18.703
Ultimately, we have to ask ourselves

17:18.704 --> 17:21.373
what do we want to be,
compassionate but broke

17:21.374 --> 17:25.310
or gutsy, living in penthouses
overlooking Central Park?

17:25.310 --> 17:29.314
Are we writing the article or not?
Yes or no?

17:29.315 --> 17:31.149
Ask me in an hour.

17:36.589 --> 17:37.456
Sabrina: "Any way you slice it

17:37.457 --> 17:38.757
"the Mu Pi cheating scandal

17:38.758 --> 17:41.192
"taints not only the sorority itself

17:41.193 --> 17:42.627
"but the entire Greek system.

17:42.628 --> 17:43.828
"It is incumbent upon us

17:43.829 --> 17:45.564
"to abolish these outdated hazing practices

17:45.565 --> 17:48.433
and return the true spirit
of sisterhood to our sororities."

17:48.434 --> 17:50.235
Brilliant. That's what we're handing in.

17:50.236 --> 17:51.703
I think we made the right decision.

17:51.704 --> 17:55.273
And if you change your mind,
I've got it on tape.

17:55.274 --> 17:57.342
Hi.

17:59.912 --> 18:02.380
You came home just to eat my breakfast?

18:02.381 --> 18:06.051
That and I'm looking for someone
to write my paper on Hemingway.

18:06.052 --> 18:10.255
What is there to say
about a model-turned-actress?

18:10.256 --> 18:12.891
I'm pretty sure they meant Ernest.

18:12.892 --> 18:14.659
What happened? I thought
your little Mu Pi lackeys

18:14.660 --> 18:16.561
were handling your academic needs.

18:16.562 --> 18:19.731
Oh, didn't you hear? Some
Goody Two-shoes named Lynn

18:19.732 --> 18:21.399
rallied all the other rushees

18:21.400 --> 18:23.935
to take a stand against the homework thing.

18:23.936 --> 18:25.070
They're not doing it.

18:25.071 --> 18:26.638
You're kidding!

18:26.639 --> 18:30.375
The Boston Times... does not kid.

18:30.376 --> 18:32.777
Somebody obviously talked.

18:32.778 --> 18:35.080
I'm glad you two weren't involved.

18:36.716 --> 18:38.550
Oh, by the way, next time

18:38.551 --> 18:41.620
don't get powdered-- it
sticks to my lip gloss.

18:43.489 --> 18:45.690
"Cheating scandal exposed
at Adams sorority.

18:45.691 --> 18:48.827
Rushees launch protest
and stand up for themselves."

18:48.828 --> 18:50.095
Let me see that.

18:50.096 --> 18:51.063
Do you know why the women of Mu Pi

18:51.064 --> 18:52.464
stood up for themselves?

18:52.465 --> 18:55.800
Because of me, Sabrina Spellman.
I made an impact.

18:55.801 --> 18:58.370
I reached out to those girls,
and I touched their lives.

18:58.371 --> 18:59.938
You touched my life, too.

18:59.939 --> 19:00.840
I did? How?

19:00.841 --> 19:02.107
Thanks to you, I've got no story.

19:02.108 --> 19:04.909
The Boston Times scooped us,
and now we've got nothing.

19:04.945 --> 19:06.277
Wow, you're right.

19:06.278 --> 19:07.746
Um, what should we do?

19:07.747 --> 19:09.014
Sabrina, you should have thought about that

19:09.015 --> 19:11.149
before you took all night
to make up your mind.

19:11.150 --> 19:12.717
If we had come right home
and written the story

19:12.718 --> 19:14.152
we would've made last night's deadline

19:14.153 --> 19:15.453
and scooped the Times.

19:15.454 --> 19:17.222
Is that all that you care about, the glory?

19:17.223 --> 19:19.124
I don't want glory; I just want credit

19:19.125 --> 19:20.759
for the work that I put in.

19:20.760 --> 19:23.194
You have the credit-- the credit is knowing

19:23.195 --> 19:25.363
in your heart you made a difference.

19:25.364 --> 19:26.132
Let me ask you something.

19:26.133 --> 19:28.800
When you wrote those hard-hitting
stories in high school

19:28.801 --> 19:30.268
what was the point?

19:30.269 --> 19:31.469
To nail the white supremacists

19:31.470 --> 19:33.872
or to get your name on the front page?

19:34.874 --> 19:38.874
Okay. Maybe it's good
that they did the right thing

19:39.812 --> 19:42.213
and that we're the ones that inspired them.

19:42.214 --> 19:45.116
I think in the long run, we're going
to be very proud of what we did.

19:45.117 --> 19:46.117
I hate it when you're right.

19:46.118 --> 19:47.819
I love it when I'm right.

19:47.820 --> 19:49.354
And one good thing did come out of this.

19:49.355 --> 19:52.023
If you mention cinnamon snaps
again, I'll wring your neck.

19:52.024 --> 19:53.491
What I was going to say was

19:53.492 --> 19:57.595
that we discovered the two of us
make a pretty good team.

19:57.596 --> 20:00.265
Yeah, I guess we do.

20:00.266 --> 20:03.301
Unfortunately, we still have no story.

20:03.302 --> 20:04.869
Well, I'll tell you what we do have:

20:04.870 --> 20:06.905
two plaid skirts we'll never wear again;

20:06.906 --> 20:08.406
two stretched-out bras;

20:08.407 --> 20:10.475
and, uh, the recipe for those things

20:10.476 --> 20:12.644
I'm not supposed to mention.

20:19.752 --> 20:22.487
Hey. Great news.

20:22.488 --> 20:24.689
You're looking at Sabrina
Spellman, college reporter.

20:24.690 --> 20:25.924
Roxie and I made the paper!

20:25.925 --> 20:27.425
That's fantastic, honey.

20:27.426 --> 20:29.027
What'd you end up writing about?

20:29.028 --> 20:30.428
We did an entertainment review.

20:30.429 --> 20:33.231
The journalism teacher said she loved
it's hard-hitting honesty.

20:33.232 --> 20:34.232
Well, that's wonderful.

20:34.233 --> 20:35.467
What's wonderful?

20:35.468 --> 20:37.502
Uh, nothing you'd be interested in.

20:37.503 --> 20:39.671
Well, let me see.

20:39.672 --> 20:40.639
( gasps )

20:40.640 --> 20:43.575
I see the name Sabrina in a byline.

20:43.576 --> 20:47.712
"Coffeehouse Showcase--
Grounds For Staying Home.

20:47.713 --> 20:48.780
"Every Friday night

to the tone-deaf singing ferret."

21:00.326 --> 21:01.160
Thank you.

21:01.161 --> 21:03.294
The kid was just nervous.

21:03.295 --> 21:05.530
It was his first time on stage.

21:05.531 --> 21:07.899
I can't believe you trashed my showcase.

21:07.900 --> 21:09.000
How could you do this to me?

21:09.001 --> 21:10.902
You've ruined my reputation.

21:10.903 --> 21:12.203
Keep reading.

21:12.204 --> 21:14.305
"Although the talent was subpar

21:14.306 --> 21:16.741

21:22.014 --> 21:24.149
Sabrina, this is great. Did you read this?

21:24.150 --> 21:25.450
Yeah, I wrote it.

21:25.451 --> 21:27.853
Charming to the last drop
but one bean short of a pound.
