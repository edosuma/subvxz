WEBVTT

00:01.152 --> 00:03.187
So, do you recognize any of these men?

00:03.222 --> 00:04.751
I was hiding in the bathroom stall,

00:04.786 --> 00:05.863
so I didn't see his face.

00:05.898 --> 00:07.318
But I heard him.

00:07.353 --> 00:09.220
He was singing along
to the music at the bar.

00:09.255 --> 00:10.366
Do you remember what he was singing?

00:10.401 --> 00:12.599
I think it was that song,
"I Want It That Way."

00:12.634 --> 00:14.911
Backstreet Boys. I'm familiar. Okay.

00:15.418 --> 00:17.194
Number one, could you
please sing the opening

00:17.229 --> 00:18.362
to "I Want It That Way"?

00:18.397 --> 00:19.373
Really?

00:20.099 --> 00:21.307
Okay.

00:22.250 --> 00:23.917
? You are... ?

00:24.508 --> 00:27.254
? My fire ?

00:27.870 --> 00:29.140
Number two, keep it going.

00:29.175 --> 00:33.395
? The one... desire ?

00:33.430 --> 00:35.613
- Number three.
- ? Believe... ?

00:35.648 --> 00:37.581
? When I say ?

00:37.616 --> 00:38.950
Number four.

00:38.985 --> 00:42.353
? I want it that way ?

00:42.388 --> 00:43.955
? Tell me why! ?

00:43.990 --> 00:47.325
? Ain't nothing but a heartache ?

00:47.360 --> 00:49.093
? Tell me why! ?

00:49.128 --> 00:52.563
? Ain't nothing but a mistake ?

00:52.598 --> 00:54.256
? Now number five ?

00:54.291 --> 00:57.293
? I never want to hear you say ?

00:57.328 --> 01:02.398
- Whoo!
- ? I want it that way ?

01:02.433 --> 01:04.641
Ah, chills! Literal chills.

01:04.677 --> 01:07.036
It was number five.
Number five killed my brother.

01:07.071 --> 01:08.537
Oh, my God, I forgot about that part.

01:29.791 --> 01:32.193
Hey, it's time. You ready? You excited?

01:32.228 --> 01:34.130
Yes, I can't believe it's
finally gonna happen.

01:34.165 --> 01:36.889
Aw, you guys are gonna have
sex for the first time.

01:36.924 --> 01:40.310
I'll have you know Amy
and I do sex 24-sevs, 369.

01:40.693 --> 01:41.946
Oh no, I grossly overcompensated

01:41.981 --> 01:43.080
and now it seems like we have problems.

01:43.115 --> 01:44.322
- You done?
- Mm-hmm.

01:44.357 --> 01:46.384
Great. Jake's sister is
flying in from Dallas,

01:46.419 --> 01:47.685
and we're picking her up at the airport.

01:47.720 --> 01:49.186
- You have a sister?
- Half-sister.

01:49.221 --> 01:50.988
Turns out that my slutty pilot dad

01:51.023 --> 01:53.190
made daughters is several
major airline hubs.

01:53.414 --> 01:57.528
ATL and EWR didn't respond when
I reached out, but DFW is DTM.

01:57.563 --> 01:59.463
Down to meet. Well, we should get going.

01:59.498 --> 02:02.110
Her flight's gonna land soon,
but wish me luck.

02:02.145 --> 02:03.480
I'm about to be a brother.

02:04.570 --> 02:06.037
Captain Holt, I need a...

02:06.072 --> 02:07.438
what's going on?

02:07.473 --> 02:09.306
My doctor said I should be more active,

02:09.341 --> 02:12.109
but my squash club recently
transitioned to racquetball.

02:12.144 --> 02:13.544
Since I'm not a dope-smoking hooligan,

02:13.579 --> 02:14.945
I decided to quit.

02:15.112 --> 02:16.246
Boyle is teaching me yoga.

02:16.281 --> 02:17.582
Genevieve got me into it.

02:17.617 --> 02:18.682
You can't believe
how many different ways

02:18.717 --> 02:21.218
I can wrap my legs around her. Six!

02:21.253 --> 02:22.686
Captain, if you wanted to be healthier,

02:22.721 --> 02:24.837
why not come to me? I'm ripped as hell.

02:24.872 --> 02:27.925
Sarge, health is about
flexibility and peace of mind

02:27.960 --> 02:30.829
and bone strength, not
building vanity muscles.

02:30.864 --> 02:33.207
Vanity muscles? I use all of these.

02:33.242 --> 02:34.842
Really? Even the large neck ones?

02:34.877 --> 02:36.779
They help me sleep upright on airplanes!

02:36.814 --> 02:38.388
Well, there's no reason to be defensive,

02:38.423 --> 02:40.544
just because you don't have
the bone strength of a yogi.

02:40.579 --> 02:42.840
We all have our thing. You're a muscler,

02:42.875 --> 02:43.923
I'm a boner.

02:45.071 --> 02:46.410
Terry can do yoga.

02:46.445 --> 02:48.045
Terry is a yoga beast.

02:48.452 --> 02:49.947
Watch. Give me a yoga to do.

02:49.982 --> 02:51.982
Ah, well, we're in warrior pose now,

02:52.017 --> 02:54.285
but I suppose for you we can
start in child's pose.

02:54.320 --> 02:55.908
Terry is not a child!

02:55.943 --> 02:58.622
Terry is a warrior.

02:58.657 --> 02:59.929
And...

03:02.094 --> 03:04.228
That didn't sound good.
Are you okay, Jeffords?

03:04.452 --> 03:05.715
I'm fine.

03:06.165 --> 03:08.501
Now, if you'll excuse me,

03:08.536 --> 03:10.967
I'm going to walk out of here normally

03:11.202 --> 03:13.604
using my trademark tiny steps.

03:13.639 --> 03:14.672
Okay?

03:17.009 --> 03:18.476
What you looking at?

03:18.511 --> 03:21.145
Did the Kanye West cannibalism
story finally break?

03:21.180 --> 03:22.480
- What? Is that a thing?
- Yeah.

03:22.515 --> 03:24.181
He eats tiny little bites of people

03:24.216 --> 03:26.016
when he hugs them goodbye.

03:26.051 --> 03:28.319
I tipped off Page Six, I don't
know why they're sitting on it.

03:28.354 --> 03:29.651
Just looking on a dating app.

03:29.686 --> 03:31.689
Weird. Lame. Gross.

03:31.724 --> 03:33.529
Dumb. Freak. Loser.

03:33.564 --> 03:35.111
Perv. Toothy. Mouthy.

03:35.146 --> 03:36.694
- Well, what happened to Becky?
- Who?

03:36.729 --> 03:38.647
The girl you were seeing
whose name you wouldn't tell us

03:38.682 --> 03:40.238
so we just started calling her Becky.

03:40.273 --> 03:42.023
Becky and I broke up.
She ate soup too much.

03:42.058 --> 03:43.566
- What, like every day?
- It happened twice.

03:43.601 --> 03:45.309
Okay, well, listen, you're in luck.

03:45.344 --> 03:47.678
Because I have the perfect girl for you,

03:47.713 --> 03:49.213
and I'm actually texting
with her right now.

03:49.248 --> 03:51.130
No. You are terrible at setting me up.

03:51.165 --> 03:52.408
Remember that dork, Justin?

03:52.443 --> 03:53.743
He was a tattoo artist,

03:53.778 --> 03:56.046
- and he rode a motorcycle.
- A Yamaha.

03:56.081 --> 03:57.814
He might as well have picked me
up in a station wagon.

03:57.849 --> 03:59.750
You know what, men are
difficult because they're all

03:59.785 --> 04:02.419
secretly monsters, but now
that I know you're bi,

04:02.454 --> 04:04.858
that changes everything.
I know so many great women.

04:04.893 --> 04:07.098
I'm sorry. I just don't think
this is something you're good at.

04:07.133 --> 04:09.927
What? The only thing
I'm not good at is modesty,

04:09.962 --> 04:11.795
because I'm great at it.

04:12.931 --> 04:14.698
Okay, according to the flight board,

04:14.733 --> 04:16.065
she should be here any minute.

04:16.101 --> 04:18.769
I love watching a "TBD"
turn into a gate num.

04:18.803 --> 04:20.370
What's wrong?

04:20.404 --> 04:21.971
- Why do you look like that?
- I'm so nervous.

04:22.007 --> 04:23.836
My hands are shaking and
my butt is hella sweaty.

04:23.871 --> 04:25.157
I totally understand.

04:25.192 --> 04:27.778
I freaked out when I met my
pen pal from Thailand, Mongkut.

04:27.813 --> 04:29.012
But everything worked out, right?

04:29.047 --> 04:30.367
You and Mongkut are
lifelong friends now.

04:30.402 --> 04:32.649
No, Mongkut turned out to
be a 45-year-old prisoner.

04:32.684 --> 04:33.784
It was a really awkward trip.

04:33.819 --> 04:36.820
That sounds horrible. Amy,
what if this is a Mongkut situation?

04:36.855 --> 04:38.413
Oh no, that pen pal service
is shut down.

04:38.448 --> 04:40.724
This is your sister.
It's gonna be great.

04:40.759 --> 04:43.051
You just have to relax and be yourself.

04:43.086 --> 04:44.820
But what if myself isn't
good enough, you know?

04:44.855 --> 04:46.421
What if I'm the Mongkut?

04:46.456 --> 04:47.923
- Jake...
- Right. You're right.

04:47.958 --> 04:49.658
It's gonna be great.
Just got to stay positive.

04:49.693 --> 04:51.335
We're gonna see each other
from across the room,

04:51.370 --> 04:53.136
we'll lock eyes, I'll say "noice,"

04:53.171 --> 04:55.505
she'll say "toit,"
and then six months later,

04:55.540 --> 04:56.540
we'll be on "The Amazing Race" together.

04:56.575 --> 04:57.541
Jake?

04:57.576 --> 04:59.776
Ka... oh, no.

04:59.811 --> 05:01.645
It's me, Kate. Give me a hug.

05:01.680 --> 05:04.041
- Stand down, ma'am.
- Back off, dude!

05:04.076 --> 05:05.815
- That's my brother!
- Oh, no.

05:06.350 --> 05:07.983
It's a Mongkut situation.

05:11.462 --> 05:13.187
So, this is awkward,

05:13.222 --> 05:14.355
but we should probably address

05:14.390 --> 05:16.357
- the elephant in the room.
- Right.

05:16.392 --> 05:18.459
Are we doing table apps or solo apps?

05:18.494 --> 05:20.227
Uh, table apps and lots of them.

05:20.262 --> 05:22.263
If it is fried, it must be tried.

05:22.298 --> 05:24.265
- Johnny Cochran.
- I remember when he said that.

05:24.300 --> 05:25.766
- Jake.
- Right.

05:26.087 --> 05:28.636
So, what I actually meant was,

05:29.084 --> 05:30.404
we should probably talk about the whole

05:30.439 --> 05:32.406
handcuffs at the airport thing.

05:32.441 --> 05:33.840
I know. I'm so sorry.

05:33.862 --> 05:35.309
That was a really bad first impression.

05:35.344 --> 05:36.777
It's just, I was on the plane

05:36.812 --> 05:38.212
and started to get really nervous

05:38.247 --> 05:39.747
about meeting you for the first time.

05:39.782 --> 05:41.087
I was nervous to meet you too.

05:41.122 --> 05:42.384
My butt got hella sweaty.

05:42.419 --> 05:44.025
- I told Amy. You can ask her.
- Please don't.

05:44.060 --> 05:46.978
So I went to the bathroom and
started vaping to calm down.

05:47.013 --> 05:49.290
Then this weird-ass lady comes
up to me, and I'm like,

05:49.325 --> 05:51.260
bitch, you're trying to tell me
your kid doesn't like the smell

05:51.295 --> 05:52.967
of cotton candy?

05:53.002 --> 05:54.336
Right, but the only thing I don't get

05:54.371 --> 05:56.105
is why they would
handcuff you for vaping.

05:56.140 --> 05:57.474
Because they're the worst!

05:57.509 --> 05:58.865
Yeah, Amy, 'cause they're the worst.

05:58.900 --> 06:00.833
Also, I slapped a stewardess,

06:01.042 --> 06:02.249
real hard.

06:03.272 --> 06:04.539
With my fist.

06:04.574 --> 06:05.597
Oh.

06:05.741 --> 06:08.208
So they were not the worst.

06:08.243 --> 06:09.576
Oh, my God, are you mad at me?

06:09.611 --> 06:12.879
Oh, no, I messed this up.
I am so sorry, Jake.

06:12.914 --> 06:14.548
I really wanted this trip to go well

06:14.583 --> 06:16.217
and was looking forward to
finally having a brother

06:16.252 --> 06:17.720
for the first time.

06:17.755 --> 06:19.556
You know what, I'm just...
I think I'm just gonna leave.

06:19.591 --> 06:21.158
No, don't leave, okay?

06:21.193 --> 06:22.694
It's fine. I get it.

06:22.729 --> 06:24.564
It's so crazy that we're
finally meeting each other.

06:24.599 --> 06:26.711
So just forget about the plane.
That's ancient history.

06:26.746 --> 06:27.795
- Really?
- Yes.

06:27.830 --> 06:29.229
This trip was about us
getting to know each other,

06:29.264 --> 06:30.831
- so let's do that.
- Okay.

06:30.866 --> 06:32.166
What's your favorite scene
in "Die Hard"?

06:32.201 --> 06:33.469
Die what?

06:33.504 --> 06:34.870
It's okay. It's okay.

06:35.037 --> 06:37.133
Um, when was the last time
you saw your dad?

06:37.168 --> 06:39.979
I mean, I've only ever
met him like nine times.

06:40.014 --> 06:42.652
Ten if you count the time
he sent his co-pilot Steve

06:42.687 --> 06:44.311
to hang out with me, 'cause
he was too hungover.

06:44.346 --> 06:46.313
I remember Steve.
He taught me how to shave.

06:46.348 --> 06:47.957
- He taught me how to shave.
- Where?

06:47.992 --> 06:50.517
- Steve was the best.
- Freakin' Steve.

06:55.257 --> 06:56.423
Jeffords, what are you still doing here?

06:56.458 --> 06:58.156
You're clearly injured. Go home.

06:58.191 --> 07:00.992
I'm totally fine. Here. I can prove it.

07:09.346 --> 07:11.338
I'm fine. See?

07:11.776 --> 07:13.710
You can't have thought
that went well for you.

07:13.745 --> 07:16.577
It's okay, Sarge. Just admit
you can't handle yoga.

07:16.612 --> 07:17.977
I can handle it fine.

07:18.012 --> 07:20.542
I'm just a little sore from my
real workouts.

07:20.577 --> 07:22.979
With weights. Now, I've got work to do.

07:23.540 --> 07:25.675
Oops.

07:25.710 --> 07:27.576
Dropped my phone. You know what?

07:27.824 --> 07:29.292
My contract is up.

07:29.327 --> 07:31.161
It's time for an upgrade anyway.

07:35.798 --> 07:36.797
- Scully?
- Huh?

07:36.832 --> 07:38.231
Where's your secret nap room?

07:38.266 --> 07:39.499
I don't know what you're talking about.

07:40.155 --> 07:42.180
Help me! Please!

07:44.632 --> 07:46.072
Couch. Space heater.

07:46.107 --> 07:48.108
We soundproof for maximum privacy.

07:48.143 --> 07:50.209
And there's sodas and candy
in the mini fridge.

07:50.244 --> 07:53.013
- This room's a little small.
- We had a big nap room,

07:53.048 --> 07:55.615
and you gave it to Gina to pump
breast milk in, remember?!

07:55.650 --> 07:56.850
Sorry, Scully.

07:56.885 --> 07:58.185
You tell anyone about this place,

07:58.220 --> 08:00.987
I will burn your life to the ground.

08:01.022 --> 08:03.522
Oh, and there's a spray if you fart.

08:04.292 --> 08:05.992
Okay, that is nothing.

08:06.027 --> 08:08.028
The one parent-teacher
conference my dad went to,

08:08.063 --> 08:10.897
he had sex with my teacher
on top of the diorama I made

08:10.932 --> 08:12.299
of the first Thanksgiving.

08:12.334 --> 08:14.267
Oh, no, he ruined all your hard work.

08:14.302 --> 08:16.036
Oh, not really, it was just
a bunch of Smurfs on a plate.

08:16.071 --> 08:17.571
- Oh.
- He came to visit once,

08:17.606 --> 08:20.140
and hooked up with my mom's
entire book club.

08:20.175 --> 08:22.175
She can't see a copy of
"A Prayer For Owen Meany"

08:22.210 --> 08:23.555
without fully weeping.

08:23.591 --> 08:24.590
I don't know what that is.

08:24.626 --> 08:25.992
But enough about our dad.

08:26.028 --> 08:27.195
- What's going on in your life?
- Honestly,

08:27.231 --> 08:28.197
it's been a tough year.

08:28.233 --> 08:29.733
I lost my job,

08:29.769 --> 08:31.936
love of my life Kurt
just broke up with me.

08:31.972 --> 08:33.205
Oh, hey, Amy has seven brothers.

08:33.241 --> 08:34.506
Maybe you could date one of them.

08:34.543 --> 08:35.976
Oh, snap. I'm down to clown.

08:36.011 --> 08:37.812
Which one has the best body?

08:37.958 --> 08:39.826
- Uhhh...
- Tony.

08:39.861 --> 08:41.695
Right? It's very clearly Tony.

08:41.730 --> 08:42.962
I don't know why she hesitated.

08:42.998 --> 08:45.031
- Tony got bod.
- Tony it is.

08:45.066 --> 08:47.033
Anyway, that's my boring life in Dallas.

08:47.068 --> 08:49.669
But I'm here now, and I want
to see the real New York.

08:49.704 --> 08:50.904
Let's like...

08:50.939 --> 08:52.305
Walk across the Brooklyn Bridge?

08:52.340 --> 08:53.773
Get tanked at the Times
Square Olive Garden.

08:53.808 --> 08:55.242
And get our pictures taken
with a human statue.

08:55.277 --> 08:57.210
Right. The real New York.

08:57.245 --> 08:59.880
- Whenever you're ready.
- Hey, let me get dinner.

08:59.915 --> 09:01.114
I had like ten more drinks
than you guys.

09:01.149 --> 09:02.782
- Oh, are you sure?
- Mm-hmm.

09:02.817 --> 09:05.318
Wow, that is so sweet,
and totally unneces...

09:05.353 --> 09:06.987
- what are you doing?
- Life hack.

09:07.022 --> 09:08.855
Hey, there's glass in my food!

09:08.890 --> 09:10.023
Oh, my God oh my God,
oh my God oh my God...

09:10.058 --> 09:11.691
What kind of restaurant is this?!

09:12.727 --> 09:14.561
Where's Holt? He told me
to come in here.

09:14.596 --> 09:16.229
Nope. That was me.

09:16.264 --> 09:18.565
I've been recording his voice
for the past two years,

09:18.600 --> 09:20.333
and now I have a soundboard
where I can make him say

09:20.368 --> 09:22.545
anything I want. Check it out.

09:22.581 --> 09:28.240
Diaz. I. Need. To. See. You.
In. The. Briefing. Room. Now.

09:28.276 --> 09:29.976
Pretty cool, right? Watch this.

09:30.011 --> 09:31.845
Milk. Milk. Lemonade.

09:31.880 --> 09:34.781
Around. The. Corner. Fudge. Is. Made.

09:34.816 --> 09:36.216
- That is amazing.
- Isn't it?

09:36.251 --> 09:37.651
- What do you want?
- To find you love.

09:37.686 --> 09:38.952
- Ugh.
- Come on!

09:38.987 --> 09:41.121
Check it out: Dannika, 34.

09:41.156 --> 09:43.123
- The only female trader...
- Pass.

09:43.158 --> 09:44.724
Finance people are the worst.

09:44.759 --> 09:46.626
Okay, well, take a gander at Jessica,

09:46.661 --> 09:48.695
professional stuntwoman

09:48.730 --> 09:51.364
just back from a surf trip in Bali...

09:51.399 --> 09:53.133
Pass. People who surf
never shut up about it.

09:53.168 --> 09:55.302
Kinda true. You know who
doesn't surf? Gabrielle.

09:55.337 --> 09:57.737
- I'm out.
- Come on, Rosa.

09:57.772 --> 09:59.806
Give me a shot. If I mess it up, fine.

09:59.841 --> 10:01.341
I'll drop it, and I'll
never bring it up again.

10:01.376 --> 10:03.643
Fine. One date. That's all you get.

10:03.678 --> 10:06.279
- That's all I need.
- Hey. Diaz.

10:06.314 --> 10:08.682
Enjoy. Having. Sexual. Fun.

10:08.717 --> 10:11.017
With. Linetti's. Lesbian. Friend.

10:11.052 --> 10:13.787
Get. Some. Get. Some. Get. Some.

10:13.822 --> 10:16.723
So, your sister's a bit of a nightmare.

10:16.758 --> 10:18.858
I wouldn't say that. I mean,
at most, she's a daymare.

10:18.893 --> 10:20.694
- Those are so much scarier.
- Yeah.

10:20.729 --> 10:22.157
She put glass in her food, Jake.

10:22.193 --> 10:23.330
She's a con-woman.

10:23.365 --> 10:24.640
Look, she's a survivor.

10:24.676 --> 10:26.109
She's had a really hard life.

10:26.234 --> 10:28.101
And I thought it bad 'cause I
would only see my dad

10:28.136 --> 10:29.869
for like an afternoon once a year,

10:29.904 --> 10:32.906
but compared to her, I was
a real DJ Tanner. "Full House."

10:32.941 --> 10:35.627
- Her dad was always around.
- Yeah, I've seen "Full House."

10:35.663 --> 10:38.144
Look, I'm sorry she's
not what you expected.

10:38.179 --> 10:39.679
She is a lot.

10:39.714 --> 10:41.781
But she's my sister. And she's young,

10:41.816 --> 10:43.416
and she just got out
of a really bad breakup...

10:43.451 --> 10:45.118
Whoo!

10:46.354 --> 10:47.571
She's home.

10:47.607 --> 10:49.674
Kate! Are you okay?

10:49.858 --> 10:51.191
Sounds like you're breaking stuff.

10:51.226 --> 10:53.793
Hey! I'm sorry, were we being too loud?

10:53.828 --> 10:56.062
- We?
- Oh, hey. I'm William.

10:56.097 --> 10:57.631
I thought you just wanted a picture.

10:57.666 --> 11:00.667
Oh, we took a lot
of pictures. Get in here!

11:00.702 --> 11:02.869
- Oh, no, he's my brother.
- That doesn't bother me.

11:02.904 --> 11:04.070
Okay, I'm going to bed.

11:04.105 --> 11:05.750
Okay.

11:06.174 --> 11:07.490
Time to go home.

11:10.445 --> 11:12.813
Oh, no. Terry can't move.

11:13.048 --> 11:14.799
Terry needs help.

11:15.283 --> 11:17.617
Hel...

11:20.355 --> 11:23.823
Ugh, there are silver
butt prints everywhere.

11:23.858 --> 11:26.393
Why did he need to paint
his butt? He wears pants.

11:26.428 --> 11:28.028
Look, I'm sorry about all this.

11:28.063 --> 11:29.229
I really thought she
was gonna be like me.

11:29.264 --> 11:31.798
But scamming restaurants and
hooking up with street performers,

11:31.833 --> 11:33.166
she is 100% my dad.

11:33.201 --> 11:34.734
Look, it's a two-day trip.

11:34.769 --> 11:36.770
We just need to survive
the next 18 hours.

11:36.805 --> 11:38.772
- Sure, sure.
- And, you know, I sat through

11:38.807 --> 11:40.407
a whole play once, so I can
get through anything.

11:40.442 --> 11:42.175
I took you to that play,
and you said you loved it.

11:42.210 --> 11:43.810
- Because I did.
- Well,

11:43.845 --> 11:46.079
55 minutes in the shower
and that silver paint

11:46.114 --> 11:48.415
- will not come off.
- Gross.

11:48.450 --> 11:50.350
Anyway, my astrologer
is always telling me

11:50.385 --> 11:51.818
everything happens for a reason,

11:51.853 --> 11:53.720
and I'm like, then why did Kurt dump me?

11:53.755 --> 11:55.021
But now I know why.

11:55.223 --> 11:57.057
So I would leave Dallas
and move to New York

11:57.092 --> 11:58.591
to be near you!

11:58.626 --> 12:00.794
Whoa, really? I mean, that's great,

12:00.829 --> 12:02.328
but, you know, it's so expensive here.

12:02.363 --> 12:03.643
I'll be fine.

12:03.679 --> 12:05.765
I got a head full of dreams,
and a pocket full of glass.

12:05.800 --> 12:08.635
I'm a New Yorker now. Fuggedabout it!

12:08.670 --> 12:10.303
Yes.

12:10.807 --> 12:12.106
Forget about it.

12:15.621 --> 12:17.522
Babe. What are we gonna do?

12:17.557 --> 12:18.990
My sister cannot move here.

12:19.025 --> 12:21.113
I'll just tell her it's a bad
idea, and she shouldn't do it.

12:21.149 --> 12:22.848
Ugh, but I'm the only family she has.

12:22.884 --> 12:24.184
I don't want to hurt her feelings

12:24.220 --> 12:25.353
and send her into a downward spiral.

12:25.389 --> 12:26.955
She slept with a tin man, Jake.

12:26.991 --> 12:28.091
I don't think the spiral goes
any further down.

12:28.127 --> 12:29.393
Right. Wait, I've got it.

12:29.429 --> 12:31.658
The only reason Kate wants to move here
is because Kurt dumped her,

12:31.694 --> 12:33.157
but what if we can get him
to take her back?

12:33.193 --> 12:35.002
Then she would definitely
want to stay in Dallas!

12:35.038 --> 12:38.007
Ooh, that's smart, but what
if he's a rational person

12:38.043 --> 12:39.610
and he doesn't want to be
with her anymore?

12:39.645 --> 12:41.345
Not a problem.
I found his Facebook page.

12:41.380 --> 12:43.180
He just posted a black and
white photo of a dead flower

12:43.215 --> 12:44.348
with the hashtags "my heart,"
"Kate forever"

12:44.383 --> 12:46.050
and "love is dead."

12:46.085 --> 12:47.648
- He misses her for some reason.
- Amy, this is it.

12:47.684 --> 12:49.181
He clearly already wants
to get back together.

12:49.217 --> 12:51.122
All we have to do is convince
him to fly here.

12:51.157 --> 12:52.431
- Jake, this might work.
- Yes!

12:52.467 --> 12:53.967
But are we actually gonna do this?

12:54.003 --> 12:55.880
Are we really going to fly
a man to New York City

12:55.916 --> 12:57.650
just to ensure that my new
sister doesn't move here?

12:57.686 --> 12:59.043
Hey, Amy, do you have
a morning-after pill

12:59.079 --> 13:01.613
I could bomb? I will get you back.

13:01.649 --> 13:03.586
Use. My. Miles.

13:03.987 --> 13:05.613
Boyle, have you seen Sergeant Jeffords?

13:05.649 --> 13:08.592
Oh, do you mean Sore-gent Jeff-hurts?

13:08.628 --> 13:10.016
He didn't make it home
last night, Boyle.

13:10.052 --> 13:12.211
- Oh, no. I'm so sorry.
- You should be.

13:12.247 --> 13:13.606
He could be in grave danger,

13:13.642 --> 13:15.042
and you just flippantly
called him Sore-gent.

13:15.078 --> 13:17.480
Oh, my God. I'm the worst.
Who does that?

13:17.516 --> 13:19.998
Well, his car's still here, so I don't
think he ever left the building.

13:20.034 --> 13:21.523
- He's probably fine.
- What?

13:21.559 --> 13:23.226
Then why did you make me feel so bad?

13:23.262 --> 13:24.580
To teach you a lesson about

13:24.616 --> 13:26.549
about the destructive power of wordplay.

13:26.585 --> 13:28.534
Now, where could he be?

13:32.264 --> 13:33.597
Why are we going home?

13:33.632 --> 13:35.599
We haven't even done
the "Sex and the City" tour.

13:35.634 --> 13:37.004
Oh, my gosh, I am such a

13:37.040 --> 13:39.236
"that one who fell through
the sidewalk hole."

13:39.271 --> 13:41.572
Yeah, you totally are.
We're just so excited

13:41.607 --> 13:42.643
you're moving here, we thought,

13:42.679 --> 13:45.217
why not go straight home
and celebrate at exactly 8:00?

13:45.253 --> 13:46.719
- Kate.
- Kurt?

13:46.755 --> 13:49.056
- Kurt? The Kurt?
- What?! Oh, my God,

13:49.092 --> 13:50.525
what are the chances?

13:50.561 --> 13:52.581
Kate, you didn't tell us
how handsome Kurt is.

13:52.617 --> 13:53.883
I love your...

13:54.153 --> 13:55.453
jean shorts.

13:55.488 --> 13:57.488
Babe, breaking up with you

13:57.523 --> 13:59.369
was the biggest mistake of my life.

13:59.405 --> 14:01.926
It was? Oh, my God, he flew all the way

14:01.961 --> 14:04.562
to New York to tell me that.
That's so romantic.

14:04.597 --> 14:05.946
It's beautiful, really.

14:05.993 --> 14:07.282
You're not even allowed
to leave the state.

14:07.318 --> 14:08.307
- What's that now?
- One more time?

14:08.343 --> 14:10.137
You think I'm gonna let
my skank parole officer

14:10.173 --> 14:11.539
stand in the way of true love?

14:11.575 --> 14:12.641
Kurt!

14:14.139 --> 14:15.585
He seems like a cool guy.

14:16.173 --> 14:17.673
Jeffords isn't in the evidence locker.

14:17.709 --> 14:18.783
He's not in the file room, either.

14:18.819 --> 14:20.976
I mean, there's nowhere
left to hide. I'm worried.

14:21.012 --> 14:24.247
Actually, I think I know where he is.

14:24.313 --> 14:26.947
I could take you there, but
you need to wear blindfolds.

14:26.983 --> 14:28.292
- No.
- Okay.

14:28.328 --> 14:30.295
I guess he'll just die in
Supply Closet F, then.

14:30.331 --> 14:31.631
He's in Supply Closet F!

14:31.667 --> 14:32.727
Great work.

14:33.492 --> 14:36.227
I'm sorry. I feel so stupid.

14:36.262 --> 14:39.196
Oh, it's okay. They tricked you somehow.

14:39.231 --> 14:41.209
I still love you, buddy.

14:43.806 --> 14:46.504
- Oh, thank God, you found me!
- Jeffords, are you okay?

14:46.539 --> 14:48.372
Charles was right.
I couldn't handle yoga.

14:48.407 --> 14:49.557
Well, we're here to help.

14:49.593 --> 14:51.374
I'll get a couple officers
to help lift you up.

14:51.410 --> 14:53.609
No need. I can handle this.

14:53.645 --> 14:55.111
Charles, there's no way you can lift me.

14:55.147 --> 14:57.248
Yoga's given me great
bone strength, Terry.

14:57.284 --> 14:59.036
So get ready...

14:59.629 --> 15:01.596
you're about to enter the bone zone.

15:01.632 --> 15:03.232
- Not a thing.
- Shhh.

15:03.556 --> 15:05.289
? Joe Cocker's "Up Where We Belong" ?

15:05.324 --> 15:08.859
? Love lift us up where we belong ?

15:10.529 --> 15:13.130
? Where the eagles cry ?

15:13.585 --> 15:16.847
? On a mountain high ?

15:17.275 --> 15:21.005
Rosa, I want to introduce you
to my friend Trishelle.

15:21.040 --> 15:22.373
- Hi.
- Sparks.

15:22.408 --> 15:24.408
Well, I'm gonna take off.
You two have fun.

15:24.443 --> 15:25.936
Get. Some.

15:26.256 --> 15:27.889
I made a mobile version.

15:27.925 --> 15:29.559
So, what are you drinking?

15:29.595 --> 15:30.730
I'll have a margarita.

15:30.766 --> 15:32.349
But, like, a skinny margarita.

15:32.384 --> 15:36.153
So, like, tequila, lime,
and a tiny splash of agave.

15:36.188 --> 15:38.455
- Mm. I refuse to order that.
- You don't have to.

15:38.490 --> 15:40.391
I heard her. What do you want?

15:40.426 --> 15:42.716
Just take your cheapest whisky
and pour it into your nearest glass.

15:42.752 --> 15:44.929
- That's a drink.
- So, with this diet

15:44.964 --> 15:48.198
that I'm on, you can eat
anything that's clear.

15:48.233 --> 15:50.301
- Mm.
- Like rice noodles,

15:50.336 --> 15:51.835
pineapple gummi bears...

15:51.870 --> 15:53.571
So Kurt and I talked,

15:53.606 --> 15:57.007
and I'm sorry, Jake, I know
I said I'd stay in New York,

15:57.042 --> 15:59.009
but I can't give up on this guy.

15:59.044 --> 16:00.878
Especially not after he
flew out here for me.

16:00.913 --> 16:03.744
Well, sounds like the universe just
really wants you to be in Dallas.

16:03.780 --> 16:05.960
But on a personal note,
it is such a bummer.

16:05.996 --> 16:07.263
I just missed her so much.

16:07.453 --> 16:08.919
And so do the kids.

16:08.954 --> 16:10.020
Oh, you have kids?

16:10.055 --> 16:11.244
Kurt has six.

16:11.590 --> 16:13.223
Who's watching them now?

16:13.258 --> 16:14.572
- The state.
- Oh, fun.

16:14.608 --> 16:16.776
We're getting to know Kurt.

16:17.096 --> 16:19.363
Ooh, hey, sorry, the door was unlocked,

16:19.398 --> 16:20.598
so I opened it. Is Kate here?

16:20.633 --> 16:22.166
Oh, hey.

16:22.201 --> 16:23.757
I think I left my wallet
in your couch bed.

16:23.793 --> 16:25.026
Uh, have you seen it?

16:25.062 --> 16:26.702
- It's silver.
- Babe, who is this?

16:26.738 --> 16:27.865
- Babe?
- That's William.

16:27.901 --> 16:29.768
He is a human statue I know.

16:29.804 --> 16:31.037
Yeah, it's not really a
good time right now, William.

16:31.073 --> 16:32.373
We don't have your wallet. Bye.

16:32.409 --> 16:34.876
Did you have sex with this silver man?

16:34.912 --> 16:36.813
- Did you cheat on me?
- We were broken up.

16:36.849 --> 16:39.282
And you cheated on me like
ten times when we were dating.

16:39.318 --> 16:40.918
'Cause you were sad all the time.

16:40.953 --> 16:42.920
- 'Cause my mom died.
- Oh, no.

16:42.955 --> 16:44.421
- In March.
- That's so recent.

16:44.456 --> 16:46.357
Fine. I'm sorry, Kurt. I'm sorry.

16:46.392 --> 16:48.292
What? No, don't apologize to this guy.

16:48.327 --> 16:50.194
- He's a dick.
- Excuse me?

16:50.229 --> 16:51.562
You're not good enough for my sister.

16:51.597 --> 16:53.364
I didn't realize you were this tall.

16:53.399 --> 16:55.399
Kurt. She's not going anywhere with you.

16:55.434 --> 16:57.534
Take your jean shorts
and the butt that's in them

16:57.569 --> 16:59.269
and get out of my apartment.

16:59.304 --> 17:01.038
What the hell, man? You're
the one who flew me out here

17:01.073 --> 17:02.840
and begged me to bring her
back to Dallas.

17:02.875 --> 17:04.207
- Just...
- Kate!

17:05.477 --> 17:06.526
Tsk.

17:06.981 --> 17:08.692
You begged him to get rid of me?

17:08.728 --> 17:09.961
Uh...

17:10.249 --> 17:11.973
Hey!

17:13.007 --> 17:14.729
Found my wallet.

17:27.633 --> 17:29.104
Thanks, guys.

17:29.501 --> 17:31.138
Have a blessed day.

17:36.797 --> 17:38.343
So he was a robot man.

17:42.416 --> 17:43.716
So you were trying to get rid of me?

17:43.751 --> 17:45.447
I mean... Yeah, kinda.

17:45.483 --> 17:47.409
But I also just told off Kurt
for being a jerk to you,

17:47.445 --> 17:49.145
so who's to say which thing
we should focus on?

17:49.255 --> 17:50.955
Anyways, let's go to Olive
Garden and get tanked.

17:50.990 --> 17:53.424
No, I won't, because
that place is for family.

17:53.459 --> 17:54.458
Ah, that stings.

17:54.493 --> 17:56.105
Look, we're still family.

17:56.141 --> 17:57.560
I just didn't think you
should be moving to New York.

17:57.596 --> 17:58.967
The whole plan seemed a little...

17:59.549 --> 18:00.682
how do I put this delicately...

18:00.718 --> 18:01.698
psychotic.

18:01.734 --> 18:03.701
I didn't ask you to be a part
of my life, Jake.

18:03.736 --> 18:04.822
You asked me.

18:04.858 --> 18:06.636
I was perfectly happy in Dallas

18:06.672 --> 18:09.273
with no dad and a dead mom,

18:09.308 --> 18:11.068
being walked all over
by Kurt and his kids.

18:11.104 --> 18:12.643
That doesn't sound like
a great situation.

18:12.678 --> 18:14.378
Yeah, it's bad, okay?!

18:14.413 --> 18:16.580
Which is why when I got
a call out of the blue

18:16.615 --> 18:18.449
that I had a brother who
wanted to meet me,

18:18.484 --> 18:20.317
I got a little excited. I'm so sorry.

18:20.352 --> 18:22.686
I was excited too, but we
don't know each other.

18:22.721 --> 18:24.288
You shouldn't move here just for me.

18:24.323 --> 18:25.723
Don't worry. I'm going back to Dallas.

18:25.758 --> 18:27.493
You won't ever have to see me again.

18:27.793 --> 18:29.960
Until, that is, I'm on "The Voice,"

18:29.995 --> 18:34.965
at point, you'll see me...
? Everywhere! ?

18:35.000 --> 18:37.067
- Oh.
- Oh you don't like my singing?

18:37.102 --> 18:39.936
Well, good, because that
is the last time you get it,

18:40.072 --> 18:47.490
? For freeeeeeee! ?

18:49.982 --> 18:51.649
She's gonna do bad on "The Voice."

18:52.070 --> 18:54.385
So, how'd it go last night?

18:54.420 --> 18:57.388
- Worst date I've ever been on.
- Oh, no, that sucks.

18:57.423 --> 18:59.390
Then why are you coming in
to work so late?

18:59.425 --> 19:02.126
It's almost like you
spent the night somewhere.

19:02.161 --> 19:04.495
I don't know, like,
maybe the bartender's?

19:04.530 --> 19:05.869
Wait, what? How do you know that?

19:05.905 --> 19:07.939
Because Aubrey is my friend,

19:07.982 --> 19:10.183
and she was the real set-up all along.

19:10.219 --> 19:12.052
No, no, no, no, no.

19:12.088 --> 19:14.627
Yes, I knew you'd reject
whoever I put in front of you.

19:14.690 --> 19:16.707
I mean, Trishelle was just a decoy.

19:16.742 --> 19:21.245
And you fell for it hook, line,
and skinny margarita.

19:21.280 --> 19:23.147
Nicely done. Aubrey is great.

19:23.182 --> 19:24.415
We're going to dinner again tonight.

19:24.450 --> 19:26.083
- Whoo!
- I owe you an apology.

19:26.118 --> 19:27.318
You're a great matchmaker.

19:27.353 --> 19:28.652
Thank you. And you know what?

19:28.687 --> 19:30.694
I'm just glad that you found the courage

19:31.023 --> 19:32.523
to tell me how great I am.

19:32.558 --> 19:33.669
It means so much.

19:33.705 --> 19:36.473
- Whatever.
- Have a fun night.

19:36.529 --> 19:37.983
This is not on us.

19:38.019 --> 19:39.597
I mean, it was crazy for her
to think moving to New York

19:39.632 --> 19:40.664
was a good idea, right?

19:40.699 --> 19:42.500
Yes, it was unrealistic.

19:42.535 --> 19:45.069
Just like Mongkut thinking
a ten-year-old American girl

19:45.104 --> 19:48.023
would pay his bail and help him
seek vengeance on his brother.

19:48.059 --> 19:49.264
You know, when I'm not
distracted by this,

19:49.300 --> 19:51.029
I'd really love to hear
the full Mongkut story.

19:51.065 --> 19:52.331
- It gets dark.
- Yup.

19:52.367 --> 19:54.788
Look, your sister is a lot to take.

19:54.824 --> 19:56.180
You shouldn't feel bad

19:56.215 --> 19:57.615
that you don't want
her around constantly.

19:57.650 --> 19:59.083
Right? I mean, we can
have a relationship

19:59.118 --> 20:00.751
and still live in separate cities.

20:00.786 --> 20:02.180
I'd love to see her, like,

20:02.388 --> 20:05.113
once a year for an afternoon, or...

20:06.158 --> 20:07.591
- Oh, crap.
- What?

20:07.626 --> 20:09.593
Oh, something just dawned on you.

20:09.628 --> 20:11.160
Yeah, I got to go to the airport.

20:13.287 --> 20:16.700
This is ridiculous.
Listen, the choice is yours.

20:16.735 --> 20:19.436
Lawsuit, or upgrade me
to business class.

20:19.471 --> 20:21.472
- Ball's in your court, pal!
- Hey!

20:21.507 --> 20:23.607
Kate, officers, what's going on here?

20:23.642 --> 20:25.576
This woman said she cut her
hand on a ticketing kiosk,

20:25.611 --> 20:27.678
but somebody saw her pull out
a bag of glass.

20:27.713 --> 20:29.680
That's my healing glass, and legally,

20:29.715 --> 20:32.016
you can't ask about it.
What kind of airport is this?

20:32.051 --> 20:33.953
Okay, I'm with the NYPD.
I got it from here.

20:34.153 --> 20:35.632
Thanks, guys.

20:36.155 --> 20:37.755
- What do you want?
- To apologize.

20:37.790 --> 20:39.690
Look, I was trying to get rid of you.

20:39.725 --> 20:42.293
Because you're a little bit
of a mess, kinda like dad.

20:42.328 --> 20:45.029
- Oh, I'm definitely a mess.
- But I was being like dad too.

20:45.064 --> 20:46.463
I was trying to have
a relationship with you,

20:46.498 --> 20:48.165
completely on my own terms.

20:48.200 --> 20:50.000
And we both know from
personal experience,

20:50.035 --> 20:51.969
that's a really crappy way
to treat a family member.

20:52.004 --> 20:53.404
It is.

20:53.439 --> 20:55.172
Thank you for saying that, Jake.

20:56.015 --> 20:58.542
And yes, I accept your
invitation to move in with you.

20:58.956 --> 21:01.111
- Oh. Um...
- I'm joking.

21:01.146 --> 21:03.380
I'm going back to Dallas. Don't worry.

21:04.064 --> 21:05.819
But maybe we can keep in touch.

21:06.256 --> 21:07.704
I would really like that.

21:08.053 --> 21:10.174
Man, I was worried you were
never gonna want to see me again.

21:10.210 --> 21:12.790
Are you kidding? The way you
stood up for me with Kurt,

21:13.107 --> 21:14.841
you're a great big brother.

21:15.724 --> 21:18.268
And I have so many other enemies.

21:18.597 --> 21:20.264
- You're gonna be real busy.
- Oh.

21:20.299 --> 21:22.919
Anyway, I should go. My plane's leaving.
Come here.

21:25.776 --> 21:27.746
- Noice.
- Toit.

21:29.441 --> 21:31.041
All right, sis, have a safe flight.

21:31.076 --> 21:34.111
- No vaping.
- ? No promises! ?

21:34.446 --> 21:35.946
She is bad at singing.
