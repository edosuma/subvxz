00:01.602 --> 00:04.705
My name is Lena Grisky
and I go to the best
ballet school in the world.

00:04.738 --> 00:06.072
I have a secret.

00:06.106 --> 00:07.774
I'm a time traveler from 1905

00:07.808 --> 00:10.544
and my boyfriend Henri
is doing everything he can
to get me home.

(Lena) Previously...

00:47.514 --> 00:50.116
<i>This may sound crazy</i>
<i>but I'm pretty sure</i>
<i>Henri was at the Garnier!</i>

00:50.150 --> 00:50.817
Henri?

00:50.851 --> 00:52.285
Lena?
What was that mate?

00:52.318 --> 00:54.855
<i>(Lena) But for now I have</i>
<i>to focus on the mid-season</i>
<i>showcase.</i>

00:54.888 --> 00:56.422
Are you super excited?

00:56.456 --> 00:57.591
There's so much pressure...

00:57.624 --> 00:59.425
I'm Lena's understudy?

00:59.459 --> 01:01.427
You're not still mad
I'm Max's understudy?

01:01.461 --> 01:04.230
I don't like you and I've told
you this a thousand times!

01:04.264 --> 01:05.632
But it's totally worth it!

01:06.266 --> 01:07.300
You're gonna be fine.

01:14.440 --> 01:17.711
♪ Come hell or high water ♪

01:17.744 --> 01:22.716
This is it. My last
chance to dance
on this stage is now.

01:22.749 --> 01:26.520
If I go back to 1905,
it's all over...

01:28.922 --> 01:31.692
It's over. No more ballet.

01:39.933 --> 01:43.336
Only the best survive. If you're
not up for it, then leave.

01:43.770 --> 01:45.305
She'll never keep up.

01:48.208 --> 01:49.776
You ready, chica?

01:50.410 --> 01:52.412
Rehearsal's about to start.

01:52.445 --> 01:54.480
Oh my gosh.

01:54.515 --> 01:56.482
Of course, yes, sorry.

01:56.517 --> 01:58.719
(classical music plays)

02:10.664 --> 02:15.335
(Ms Carré) Must I remind you
that you're representing
the Paris Opera Ballet School?

02:16.336 --> 02:18.605
This is the mid-season showcase.

02:18.639 --> 02:21.742
Very important people
will be in attendance.

02:21.775 --> 02:23.243
Am I clear?

02:31.818 --> 02:33.720
Be prepared.

02:33.754 --> 02:37.357
My bet is Little Miss Perfect
cracks under the pressure.
(chuckles)

02:38.525 --> 02:39.826
(Max) Lena!

02:39.860 --> 02:41.227
Hey, Lena!

02:42.529 --> 02:43.964
What was that?

02:43.997 --> 02:46.432
This has to be perfect.

02:46.466 --> 02:49.670
I can't mess it up again.
This could be my only chance.

02:49.903 --> 02:51.237
I agree.

02:51.271 --> 02:54.608
And Thea,
she really doesn't like me.

02:55.308 --> 02:58.879
You know I think she'd be
perfectly happy to see me fail
so she can take over the role.

02:58.912 --> 03:02.415
And did you see the look on
Ms Carré's face when she said
"very important people"?

03:02.448 --> 03:04.551
Talk about pressure!

03:04.585 --> 03:06.587
Wow. Okay. Hold up.

03:07.554 --> 03:11.758
What is going on with you?
Lena, you know this part
perfectly.

03:12.025 --> 03:14.861
What has gotten you all
in your head all of a sudden?

03:21.034 --> 03:23.737
Apparently I've just completely
forgotten how to dance!

03:25.972 --> 03:27.808
So fix it.

03:28.809 --> 03:30.877
Is there anything else?

03:33.346 --> 03:35.749
Fine. Don't tell me.

03:35.782 --> 03:37.951
You know there's always
something with you, Lena.

03:39.920 --> 03:41.421
(scoffs)

03:44.024 --> 03:48.829
(Ms Carré) Let's go
through the music
and focus on the arms.

03:48.862 --> 03:51.431
(Ms Carré continues in the
background)
(Lena sighs)

03:53.433 --> 03:56.637
I'm guessing you saw
my tour de force performance?

03:56.670 --> 04:00.406
Well... I was gonna say
it wasn't that bad,

04:00.440 --> 04:03.910
but it kinda was. Sorry.

04:03.944 --> 04:05.378
(Lena chuckles)

04:07.313 --> 04:08.649
I totally messed up.

04:09.482 --> 04:11.785
Like... what does Jeff say?
"Epic."

04:11.818 --> 04:14.788
(Ines scoffs)
Yeah. It was epic.

04:16.389 --> 04:17.758
I can't focus.

04:19.459 --> 04:21.995
I just know that Henri was here
and I missed him.

04:23.764 --> 04:25.766
What if he never comes back?

04:26.833 --> 04:29.469
What if that was
our only chance?

04:29.503 --> 04:33.974
On a molecular level,
considering the idea of passing
through one gravitational field

04:34.007 --> 04:36.476
to the other...
No. (chuckles)

04:36.510 --> 04:40.480
Please. I am begging you
to speak in a language
that I can understand.

04:40.514 --> 04:42.115
Okay.

04:42.148 --> 04:46.086
There is no way Henri was here
if what happened to you
is the basis of my theory.

04:46.119 --> 04:48.054
But I could feel him.

04:49.489 --> 04:54.561
Oh, and what about the letter
with my name on it
in his handwriting?

04:54.595 --> 04:57.497
It wasn't in the brick,
it was on the floor, backstage!

04:57.531 --> 05:01.367
The one that said "Dear Leng?"
No, Lena. I don't think so.

05:01.401 --> 05:03.504
It's mathematically impractical.

05:03.537 --> 05:05.438
Impossible, in fact.

05:06.507 --> 05:07.874
But what about my feelings?

05:08.542 --> 05:11.645
Feelings are unreliable
and unstable.

05:11.678 --> 05:13.413
I work with numbers.

05:13.446 --> 05:16.517
But...
No... Lena, no!

05:16.550 --> 05:19.085
OK.
Focus on the dance.

05:19.586 --> 05:20.987
Look at Thea...

05:22.055 --> 05:24.024
(Ms Carré) Nice, Thea.
(Lena) She's amazing.

05:24.057 --> 05:25.592
(Ines) She's alright.

05:26.827 --> 05:28.461
You're better.

05:28.494 --> 05:30.096
Thanks.
(chuckles)

05:30.130 --> 05:31.965
That's really nice.

05:34.701 --> 05:36.570
I just really want this moment.

05:37.037 --> 05:39.740
I think I might be back
in 1905 soon.

05:39.773 --> 05:42.709
And I don't think my mother was
joking when she said "no more
ballet."

05:42.743 --> 05:46.680
Lena. Snap out of it.
You'll be alright.

05:47.881 --> 05:49.349
Yes.

05:50.784 --> 05:53.520
Okay but just what if...
The Garnier goes on fire?

05:53.554 --> 05:55.722
Or we're abducted by aliens?

05:55.756 --> 05:57.423
Is this your version
of a pep talk?

05:57.457 --> 05:58.925
Hm-hm, do you like it?

05:58.959 --> 06:00.894
No. It's terrible.
(Ines laughs)

06:04.765 --> 06:06.499
(Ms Carré) Students...

06:12.606 --> 06:15.942
(ticking clock,
magical tinkling)

06:18.945 --> 06:21.047
Thanks to you, we have nothing.

06:21.081 --> 06:22.749
No girl.

06:22.783 --> 06:24.150
No timepiece.

06:24.184 --> 06:28.855
And now the port-a-portal is
dead, so there's no way
to time travel.

06:28.889 --> 06:31.024
Yeah. Thanks, guys.

06:31.057 --> 06:33.193
Hey, no problem.
You're welcome.

06:33.226 --> 06:35.028
(video game noises)

06:35.061 --> 06:37.831
What is the matter with you two?
What happened to the plan?

06:37.864 --> 06:41.434
I stuck to the plan! Clive's the
one who got sidetracked
by all the shiny toys.

06:41.467 --> 06:43.169
You said you were happy
without Frank. Remember?

06:43.704 --> 06:45.772
(Clive) You said
"let's run wild
like authorities".

06:45.806 --> 06:49.710
No. I said "let's run wild
in the absence of authority".

06:51.111 --> 06:52.913
That's a lot of words, Pinky.

06:54.147 --> 06:57.851
Yeah. Well, that worked
really well for you, didn't it?

06:57.884 --> 06:59.152
Yes.
No.

07:00.887 --> 07:01.988
You're both fired.

07:02.989 --> 07:04.525
What about you?

07:04.558 --> 07:07.994
If you hadn't run off,
we wouldn't have spent
so much time trying to find you.

07:08.028 --> 07:11.064
Then we would have found
the timepiece and the girl!

07:11.698 --> 07:14.935
Stop calling her "the girl".
Her name is Lena!

07:14.968 --> 07:16.570
Wow.
(loud beeping noise)

07:16.603 --> 07:17.904
What is that noise?
Yesss!

07:19.506 --> 07:21.542
I just cleared level six!

07:21.575 --> 07:22.843
Wow. (chuckles)

07:23.544 --> 07:25.245
Good job, Clive.
Thank you.

07:25.278 --> 07:28.782
Have you guys seen this?
He brought it back
from the future!

07:30.651 --> 07:34.220
I bet you can't clear level six.

07:36.823 --> 07:38.625
I can clear anything.

07:38.659 --> 07:39.926
Give me that.

07:39.960 --> 07:41.461
(Henri) I bet you can't.

07:42.128 --> 07:44.197
Clive is really good
at this game.

07:44.631 --> 07:47.033
Well... Watch me.

07:47.067 --> 07:50.804
Around the quicksand mate!
Ahhh, tough break. My turn.

07:54.107 --> 07:57.578
Pinky, go left.
Yeah, go left. Let's go left.

07:57.611 --> 07:59.780
I'm going left!
No, my left, your right!

07:59.813 --> 08:02.082
My left is your left!
Is it?

08:04.050 --> 08:05.819
Watch out for him,
watch out for him.

08:05.852 --> 08:07.020
Dodge the wizard.

08:07.788 --> 08:08.955
Aah, you got him.

08:14.294 --> 08:16.630
(car horns honking)

08:17.698 --> 08:19.666
As if I should be
Lena's understudy.

08:20.066 --> 08:22.268
(Thea) This whole thing
is a travesty.

08:22.302 --> 08:24.871
Hey, I'm just happy
to be dancing.

08:24.905 --> 08:27.608
I owe this whole
understudy thing to L.

08:27.641 --> 08:30.243
Don't tell me you're still
buying into that
doe-eyed act of hers.

08:31.111 --> 08:33.647
It's not an act.
L's a sweetheart.

08:34.848 --> 08:36.282
Look at Dash.

08:36.316 --> 08:37.718
(Ms Carré) And lift.

08:39.052 --> 08:41.622
He's giving me the battle stare.
Forget Dash.

08:42.055 --> 08:44.090
Understudies do go on stage,
you know.

08:44.658 --> 08:45.992
Anything could happen.

08:47.127 --> 08:49.129
Like anything.

08:50.964 --> 08:52.666
Turn... Up.

08:52.699 --> 08:55.869
Shoulders. Shoulders. Again.

08:55.902 --> 08:57.938
And around...

08:57.971 --> 09:00.273
I don't like
where this is heading.

09:00.306 --> 09:01.808
An injury...

09:02.943 --> 09:04.277
A bad fall...

09:04.310 --> 09:06.913
You're not thinking
of doing anything?

09:07.147 --> 09:10.951
I mean, you wouldn't...
you know...

09:10.984 --> 09:14.187
sabotage Lena, would you?

09:15.021 --> 09:17.591
Oh, Jeffrey.
Don't be so "dramatique".

09:26.667 --> 09:29.269
That was satisfactory, Jeffrey.

09:31.204 --> 09:33.006
We just got in the game.

09:34.107 --> 09:35.642
What game?

09:35.942 --> 09:37.944
(whispers) Yo, T, what game?

09:40.313 --> 09:43.083
Let's take fifteen.

09:51.024 --> 09:55.228
That's weird, we never break
during the final rehearsal.

09:59.766 --> 10:02.102
Can we practice the lift?
Or maybe go from the top?

10:02.135 --> 10:04.905
Here. Right now.
Until it's perfect. Yeah?

10:04.938 --> 10:07.608
We can make it perfect
in fifteen minutes, right?

10:08.208 --> 10:10.243
So, which one is it?
From the top, or the lift?

10:10.276 --> 10:11.645
The lift.

10:23.223 --> 10:27.060
You look like you want to use
the destroyer deluxe on me
to eliminate me from existence.

10:27.093 --> 10:30.831
Sort of.
Put both hands on my hips.

10:30.864 --> 10:32.432
Bro, if you think
I can lift you...

10:32.465 --> 10:35.869
Zip. I just want to show you
how to distribute your weight.

10:39.039 --> 10:40.941
Now, put everything on the left.

10:42.909 --> 10:44.177
Plant your feet.

10:44.911 --> 10:48.849
Now, square off your hips.

10:50.250 --> 10:51.351
Huh.

10:51.952 --> 10:53.319
Thanks, man.

10:59.926 --> 11:02.295
Thought you were
gonna stay mad forever.
Whatever.

11:04.264 --> 11:08.835
You can't really break
the La Fée Tree Bond.
It's for life.

11:08.869 --> 11:10.971
Does that go for me too?

11:11.004 --> 11:13.406
Or are you still mad about
what I said in the tunnel?

11:15.075 --> 11:16.276
We'll see...

11:22.282 --> 11:24.885
Okay! Uhm...
Let's take five.

11:24.918 --> 11:26.386
Five more times?

11:26.419 --> 11:28.789
Five lifts?
Five more perfect run-throughs?

11:28.822 --> 11:31.424
I'm taking five.
As in minutes.

11:40.300 --> 11:43.837
(Ms Carré) Lena, Max,
Thea, Jeffrey. Step forward.

11:45.906 --> 11:48.308
My nerves are making me dizzy.

11:48.341 --> 11:52.212
(Ms Carré) Each pair
will perform the piece.
At the same time.

11:53.880 --> 11:55.181
(whispers) Great.

11:55.215 --> 11:58.484
Now we have to audition
to get our parts back.

11:58.519 --> 12:00.887
You better nail it this time.

12:08.962 --> 12:12.866
(classical music plays)

12:57.277 --> 13:00.246
Those pirouettes were brilliant!
Good adjustment!

13:00.280 --> 13:01.848
Lena. Maximus.

13:02.382 --> 13:04.284
(Ms Carré)
This is the mid-season show

13:04.317 --> 13:07.187
and you've done nothing
but underwhelm me.

13:07.220 --> 13:09.489
I'm very disappointed in you.

13:10.524 --> 13:15.796
I simply cannot risk the
reputation of the Paris Opera
Ballet School.

13:15.996 --> 13:19.900
I have no choice but to give
the roles to your understudies,

13:19.933 --> 13:21.568
Thea and Jeff.

13:23.637 --> 13:27.941
(Lena sighs disappointedly)

13:33.013 --> 13:34.214
(Max) Hey.

13:44.991 --> 13:46.527
You may never speak to me again.

13:47.994 --> 13:50.230
Or dance with me.
Or even look at me.

13:51.397 --> 13:53.033
I'm considering it.

13:56.269 --> 13:57.871
I'm so sorry.

13:58.238 --> 13:59.940
It's all my fault.

14:00.273 --> 14:04.277
Yeah, it is. I don't lose
my part to an understudy.

14:07.213 --> 14:11.251
I'll go to Ms Carré
and insist that we never
be paired together again.

14:13.286 --> 14:14.521
(Max) Lena!

14:17.490 --> 14:20.126
You didn't do it on purpose.

14:24.197 --> 14:27.433
I really am so sorry.

14:29.970 --> 14:31.672
You need my "chill method".

14:31.705 --> 14:32.706
What?

14:32.739 --> 14:36.610
No. No method is gonna fix
the mess I've made.

14:36.643 --> 14:38.612
Oh yeah, there is!
There's one, I promise you.

14:38.645 --> 14:41.582
You see. It's official.
It's chill o'clock.

14:41.615 --> 14:45.986
It's time for you to experience
my tried-and-tested
anti-anxiety method.

14:46.987 --> 14:51.057
I use it sometimes,
when things aren't going
the way I want them too.

14:52.425 --> 14:53.627
Come on.

14:59.232 --> 15:01.401
Nothing's gonna get fixed
if you're standing there.

15:01.735 --> 15:04.304
(laughs)

15:15.248 --> 15:17.250
Even your walk is tense.

15:18.519 --> 15:21.421
It's just that I don't deserve
to chill ever again
in my entire life!

15:21.454 --> 15:23.690
Alright, you know what, stop.

15:23.724 --> 15:25.091
Close your eyes.

15:25.358 --> 15:26.126
Do it!

15:27.493 --> 15:29.029
Breathe.

15:30.396 --> 15:32.065
I'm breathing.

15:32.999 --> 15:35.268
Doesn't sound like it to me.
How would you know?

15:35.301 --> 15:38.004
Are you in my lungs?
Shh. Now shake it out.

15:38.672 --> 15:41.041
What?
Come on. Shake it out.

15:41.074 --> 15:42.208
Shake what out?

15:44.444 --> 15:47.147
Stop it. Stop it!
People are looking.

15:47.180 --> 15:49.616
So? Who cares?
Come on. Shake it out.

15:52.686 --> 15:54.521
Ugh! Lame.

15:55.421 --> 15:56.590
Again.

15:59.292 --> 16:00.761
Lena, that's even more lame!

16:00.794 --> 16:04.364
I don't understand the purpose.
That's the whole point.

16:05.398 --> 16:06.967
Come on, shake it out!

16:08.602 --> 16:11.304
(Lena squeals and laughs)

16:14.240 --> 16:19.279
Everybody in Paris, know that
today is the day Lena Grisky
finally let go of the rope.

16:19.312 --> 16:21.414
Maybe you can chill after all.

16:23.216 --> 16:24.150
(Lena giggles)

16:33.627 --> 16:35.662
Will you stop thinking about it?

16:37.698 --> 16:39.666
You mess up. You move on.

16:39.700 --> 16:41.802
Come on, Lena,
I thought we were past this.

16:41.835 --> 16:44.304
How can you be so calm?

16:44.337 --> 16:49.442
Well... I could storm
into Ms Carré's office
and demand our parts back.

16:49.475 --> 16:53.146
I could flip a table.
Oh, I could burst into tears.

16:54.214 --> 16:55.415
Thank you.

16:58.552 --> 17:01.287
Don't think I didn't notice
you were about to cry.

17:02.422 --> 17:05.559
I so totally wasn't.
(scoffs)

17:07.528 --> 17:09.630
Fine.

17:09.663 --> 17:11.031
Okay.

17:11.665 --> 17:13.399
You win.

17:13.433 --> 17:15.468
We will chill.

17:23.677 --> 17:29.049
Jeffrey, what is wrong with you?
(sighs)

17:29.249 --> 17:30.483
Where do you think you're going?

17:30.517 --> 17:34.254
Into battle. I'm going to be the
Sergeant and destroy the aliens.

17:36.690 --> 17:38.358
(Jeff sighs)
It's a video game.

17:38.391 --> 17:39.793
I need to play it, right now.

17:41.294 --> 17:43.429
I mean, who are all of these
very important people coming
to the show?!

17:43.697 --> 17:45.632
You'll be fine. Hear me?

17:45.666 --> 17:47.467
Fine.
(grunts)

17:47.500 --> 17:49.069
Whoa!
I'm so sorry.

17:49.803 --> 17:50.837
He's scared.

17:50.871 --> 17:53.640
And I'm the one in the corps?
Like that's fair.

17:58.545 --> 18:01.848
(horse hooves clattering)

18:09.255 --> 18:12.593
There are wanted posters of me
in every window of every shop!

18:12.626 --> 18:14.728
You mean like this one?

18:14.761 --> 18:17.163
You're meant to be on my side.

18:17.197 --> 18:19.733
I am!
That's why I took it down.

18:19.766 --> 18:22.536
But Princess Alexandra
is not messing around.

18:22.569 --> 18:24.538
She's got everyone
looking for you.

18:25.271 --> 18:26.840
I've got to get Lena back now.

18:27.273 --> 18:29.643
It's only a matter of time
before the Time Collectors
realize

18:29.676 --> 18:30.877
I'm not actually
working with them.

18:30.911 --> 18:32.513
So what are you
going to do, exactly?

18:32.779 --> 18:35.448
We've managed
to build a port-a-portal.

18:35.481 --> 18:38.719
We just don't have enough power
to keep it running long enough.

18:41.354 --> 18:43.624
That's because
it was made in the future.

18:43.924 --> 18:46.827
We don't have
that kind of electricity yet,
as far as I know.

18:46.860 --> 18:50.230
The tools used to make this
are not even invented yet.

18:50.864 --> 18:55.602
It doesn't have to be big,
but you need something
with a little power.

18:55.636 --> 18:57.337
You are a genius!

18:58.572 --> 19:01.274
I've got a plan. And it's
going to work this time!

19:11.484 --> 19:14.220
(Lena laughs)
What?

19:14.621 --> 19:16.189
What?

19:20.393 --> 19:22.195
Well, I must say...
(Max laughs)

19:23.429 --> 19:27.634
I feel sufficiently chilled.
(laughs) Good.

19:28.835 --> 19:30.604
Now what?

19:30.637 --> 19:33.273
Now we take back what's
ours.
(Lena giggles)

19:33.774 --> 19:35.275
Oh yeah?

19:35.308 --> 19:39.212
Yeah. We're nog losing our parts
to our understudies.
That's not happening.

19:39.245 --> 19:40.614
Oh, thank goodness.

19:40.647 --> 19:43.617
I thought you'd gone
stark raving mad.

19:43.650 --> 19:45.652
Are you kidding me?
This is a big deal!

19:45.686 --> 19:48.789
Are you kidding me?
This is a huge deal.

19:48.822 --> 19:53.760
We just needed a "chill out
time" before we strategize
a plan to conquer the enemy.

19:53.794 --> 19:56.429
Okay. You need to get
this melon off your face.

19:56.462 --> 19:58.799
(laughs)
Have you looked in a mirror?
(screams)

20:01.367 --> 20:02.703
(both laugh)

20:02.936 --> 20:04.738
(video game sounds)

20:08.675 --> 20:10.511
(Jeff) Come on.
Hey.

20:10.544 --> 20:11.712
Hey.

20:12.378 --> 20:13.847
You need to pull yourself
together.

20:13.880 --> 20:16.850
(grunts) Not you again.
What's that supposed to mean?

20:16.883 --> 20:19.753
I mean, I just need a place
to settle my nerves.

20:19.786 --> 20:21.387
Like Lena does on the roof.

20:21.421 --> 20:24.357
What do you mean
about Lena on the roof?

20:24.390 --> 20:26.492
You know,
she chills on the Garnier roof.

20:26.527 --> 20:29.763
She's always writing by that
brick when she needs to get away

20:29.796 --> 20:30.564
and right now,
I need to get away.

20:32.833 --> 20:35.435
I'll meet you in the studio
in an hour. And Jeffrey?

20:35.468 --> 20:36.436
Sort yourself out.

20:40.440 --> 20:41.742
(kids giggle)

20:44.410 --> 20:46.613
No! I'm winning! No.

20:54.655 --> 20:55.989
(Lena) Thank you.

20:56.723 --> 20:59.292
Today was exactly what I needed.

21:00.326 --> 21:03.630
I know it must sound crazy,
but I just want the chance

21:03.664 --> 21:04.831
to dance that piece
at the Garnier,

21:06.499 --> 21:07.901
in case it's the last time.

21:10.070 --> 21:11.304
Why do you keep saying that?

21:14.808 --> 21:15.842
Things happen.

21:15.876 --> 21:19.012
I mean, you never know
what's around the corner.

21:21.414 --> 21:24.317
Well, what if it's not
the last time?

21:24.350 --> 21:27.487
What if we go on
to make Company and I,

21:27.521 --> 21:30.056
the greatest choreographer
in the world, of course,

21:30.090 --> 21:33.393
goes on to create a ballet
just for you?

21:33.426 --> 21:35.495
But you're right. We don't know
what's around the corner.

21:35.529 --> 21:38.665
So we should dance.
Right here. Right now

21:38.699 --> 21:40.801
(Lena giggles)

21:40.834 --> 21:42.669
But there's people watching!

21:42.703 --> 21:44.037
And we don't have any music.

21:46.940 --> 21:50.476
(classical music starts playing)

21:54.848 --> 21:56.717
(Max) There she is,
right on time.

21:57.718 --> 21:58.719
Let's dance.

22:34.788 --> 22:36.823
(crowd applaud)
Thank you.

22:53.073 --> 22:54.808
(ticking and magical
tinkling noises)

23:00.446 --> 23:03.917
Careful... Careful...
Clive, shut up!

23:03.950 --> 23:06.086
(video game noises)

23:06.987 --> 23:09.790
Go! Go! Go!
Yes! I'm so close!

23:09.823 --> 23:10.924
Hey, it's two out of three!

23:10.957 --> 23:12.959
I went up the ladder and
conquered the Mushroom World!

23:12.993 --> 23:16.129
And I got the super bonus!!
Forget all that!

23:16.162 --> 23:18.999
This is what we need
to get the portal to work!

23:19.866 --> 23:24.805
The portal plans came from
the future so this might be
the secret.

23:25.872 --> 23:28.208
I have no idea how to do it,

23:28.241 --> 23:31.712
but if there's someone
that does, it's you.

23:34.948 --> 23:36.182
Hand it over.

23:37.250 --> 23:39.953
Hey! Don't wreck
my fun new game!

23:39.986 --> 23:42.556
Try to keep up, Clive.
We use this one
to get to the future,

23:42.589 --> 23:46.426
then we can get you another
one. Another ten, if you want!

23:46.760 --> 23:49.663
Ten games?
(chuckles)

23:49.696 --> 23:51.064
That would be heaven.

23:53.033 --> 23:54.801
Are you okay, Clive?

24:02.509 --> 24:03.810
(Lena) It was not!

24:03.844 --> 24:05.111
(Ines) Sounds like a date to me.

24:05.145 --> 24:06.880
(Lena) It was for school!
(Ines) Hm-hm.

24:06.913 --> 24:09.950
Seriously. We're going to win
our parts back.

24:09.983 --> 24:11.084
(scoffs)

24:11.117 --> 24:13.587
We just have to convince
Ms Carré to give us a chance.

24:14.087 --> 24:15.556
(Lena) Oh, there she is!

24:15.589 --> 24:17.991
Ms Carré!
Whoa, dude... are you serious?

24:18.024 --> 24:20.260
You can't just ask her
for your part back.

24:20.293 --> 24:23.496
Trust me.
Max and I worked it out.

24:23.530 --> 24:25.265
Ines is right.
Wait, what?

24:25.298 --> 24:27.568
Trust me, chica.

24:27.601 --> 24:29.503
(Ms Carré)
I've had a change of heart.

24:29.536 --> 24:32.472
Thea, Jeffrey, thank you
for doing an excellent job
of filling in.

24:34.140 --> 24:36.877
But Lena and Maximus
will be performing

24:36.910 --> 24:41.582
at the mid-season showcase
as planned.
(Lena gasps)

24:41.615 --> 24:43.884
(Ms Carré) Let's get started.
From the top.

24:46.186 --> 24:51.091
But how did you...?
I told you the chill method
works every time.

24:51.124 --> 24:54.194
(Max) And I knew Ms Carré
was watching us out there.

24:59.866 --> 25:03.870
Lena ruins everything.

25:03.904 --> 25:05.972
Hey, it's okay.

25:06.006 --> 25:08.542
It's theirs,
and they're awesome.

25:08.575 --> 25:12.879
We're gonna be cool
about this, right?

25:12.913 --> 25:15.281
This isn't over.

25:18.652 --> 25:19.986
(sighs)

25:22.322 --> 25:23.690
Come on.

25:32.098 --> 25:37.904
Anyways, when I finally relaxed,
it just flowed.

25:37.938 --> 25:40.073
I wonder why
Ms Carré changed her mind.

25:40.106 --> 25:41.942
Does it really matter?

25:41.975 --> 25:43.744
I guess not.

25:43.777 --> 25:45.912
It was a great day.
Good.

25:46.179 --> 25:49.282
And I'm glad it took your mind
off Henri for a change.

25:50.951 --> 25:54.087
Oh no... I didn't think
about Henri all afternoon!

25:55.088 --> 25:56.957
Does that make me
a horrible person?

25:58.091 --> 26:01.695
I feel awful.
No, Lena, it's a good thing.

26:01.728 --> 26:03.196
You need a break sometimes.

26:03.830 --> 26:06.299
Okay? (chuckles)

26:06.867 --> 26:10.571
What have you turned me into?
(laughs)

26:25.652 --> 26:27.287
Where's that brick?

26:28.922 --> 26:30.256
Aha.

26:40.433 --> 26:44.270
"Dear Lena..." Jackpot.

26:44.304 --> 26:47.040
"I have a plan, but I need you
to follow these instructions
carefully,

26:47.073 --> 26:49.409
even if they don't make sense.

26:49.442 --> 26:52.846
Just know, that tomorrow night
I'm coming for you."
