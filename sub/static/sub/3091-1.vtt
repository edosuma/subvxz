The first time we met.

52:41.659 --> 52:42.700
By the river.

52:44.411 --> 52:46.162
You were standing at the edge,

52:46.997 --> 52:48.706
and feigning undressing.

52:51.168 --> 52:52.627
You were about to drown.

52:54.213 --> 52:56.422
I swim better than you.

53:02.138 --> 53:03.930
And if we went back to our room?

53:07.601 --> 53:09.144
Don't forget your promise.

53:11.105 --> 53:11.938
Which one?

53:14.900 --> 53:16.234
The golden deer.

Upon awaking, Belle went
exploring the castle,

53:57.109 --> 54:00.195
determined to unravel
the mysteries of the Beast.

54:00.654 --> 54:02.363
She became lost in a labyrinth

54:02.573 --> 54:04.824
of corridors and
ramshackle passageways,

54:05.034 --> 54:06.576
with, a tall times,

54:06.785 --> 54:09.495
the eerie sensation
of being followed.

A dance.

It's Belle's ghost
come to haunt us,

1:08:23.266 --> 1:08:24.683
all red and bloody.

1:08:24.934 --> 1:08:26.852
It's not a dream,

1:08:27.854 --> 1:08:28.812
It is me.

1:08:31.649 --> 1:08:33.108
Even dead she's prettier

1:08:33.318 --> 1:08:35.194
Kook at her,
she's so thin!

1:08:35.570 --> 1:08:37.488
I want you to know
I love you forever.

1:08:37.697 --> 1:08:40.491
We too, dear heart. We're

She made me take your room.

1:08:43.870 --> 1:08:44.912
I knew it!

1:08:45.246 --> 1:08:46.455

1:08:52.545 --> 1:08:55.506
He's so sad since you left,
he won't wake up anymore.

1:09:01.638 --> 1:09:02.930
What is that dress?

1:09:10.063 --> 1:09:11.271
Father?

1:09:17.070 --> 1:09:18.028
It's me.

1:09:19.197 --> 1:09:20.030
Belle.

1:09:22.367 --> 1:09:23.534
And I'm here.

1:09:27.956 --> 1:09:29.790
Come back to life,
dear father.

1:09:32.252 --> 1:09:33.585
If only for me.

1:09:37.006 --> 1:09:40.217
Father!

1:09:50.770 --> 1:09:52.479
Have you ever seen
a stone this big?

1:09:54.315 --> 1:09:56.150
You remember the cases father
brought from the castle?

1:09:56.359 --> 1:09:57.526
Oh no, not that!
I forbid you!

1:09:57.735 --> 1:09:58.986
It's our only chance,
Tristan.

1:09:59.195 --> 1:10:00.696
As long as I live,
you will not pass this door.

1:10:40.737 --> 1:10:42.362
Evening...

1:10:55.168 --> 1:10:57.211
Mystery...

1:11:01.674 --> 1:11:03.008
Dreams...

1:11:03.384 --> 1:11:04.760
Mystery...

1:11:05.470 --> 1:11:07.012
Do you see me...

1:11:09.599 --> 1:11:10.641
Hear me...

1:11:10.975 --> 1:11:11.892
Belle...

1:11:31.537 --> 1:11:32.829
that glossy coat.

1:11:34.207 --> 1:11:36.083
I can nearly smell her.

1:11:36.292 --> 1:11:37.459
Her time has come.

1:11:38.169 --> 1:11:39.628
She's mine, alright?

1:14:09.153 --> 1:14:12.114
I am the Nymph of the Forest.

1:14:15.284 --> 1:14:18.495
I had the right to take
human form.

1:14:20.415 --> 1:14:23.458
I wanted to feel
what humans call love.

1:14:27.880 --> 1:14:29.673
And then you came along,

1:14:29.882 --> 1:14:30.966
my prince.

1:14:31.676 --> 1:14:32.759
Forgive me.

1:14:43.062 --> 1:14:44.479
Father!

1:14:49.193 --> 1:14:51.027
God of the Forest.

1:14:53.906 --> 1:14:55.699
Spare my beloved.

1:14:57.410 --> 1:15:00.662
He has cherished your daughter
with eternal love.

1:15:01.873 --> 1:15:02.789
Father!

1:15:03.708 --> 1:15:04.958
Spare him.

1:15:45.666 --> 1:15:48.376
A terrifying voice
came from the sky:

1:15:48.586 --> 1:15:51.838
"For having killed my daughter,
I shall make a beast of you.

1:15:52.048 --> 1:15:54.216
"Only a woman may save you.

1:15:54.509 --> 1:15:56.885
"But where is the one
that would love you?

1:15:57.678 --> 1:15:59.804
"Be cursed for eternity."

1:16:17.281 --> 1:16:18.865
You're betraying Belle.

1:16:20.409 --> 1:16:21.409
I'm saving us.

1:16:21.786 --> 1:16:23.161
She'll understand.

1:16:24.038 --> 1:16:24.829
You'd give your right arm

1:16:25.039 --> 1:16:26.498
for another brother than me,
wouldn't you?

1:16:36.259 --> 1:16:38.718
What are we doing here,
little bunny?

1:16:38.928 --> 1:16:41.638
We were supposed to be meeting
at your country shack.

1:16:41.889 --> 1:16:42.806
Look.

1:16:43.015 --> 1:16:45.809
How handsome my men are
to meet your sisters.

1:16:48.771 --> 1:16:50.063
I'll make a deal with you.

1:16:50.273 --> 1:16:52.023
No more deals for you.

1:16:52.400 --> 1:16:54.234
I've been far too patient.

1:16:55.736 --> 1:16:56.861
Look at this.

1:16:58.698 --> 1:17:00.615
It's from an abandoned castle.
If I take you there,

1:17:00.825 --> 1:17:03.410
you get the rest of the treasure
and we're quits.

1:17:08.708 --> 1:17:11.251
And rocks like this,
how many you say?

1:17:11.460 --> 1:17:12.586
Cases packed.

1:17:15.006 --> 1:17:16.798
No games, little bunny.

1:17:17.049 --> 1:17:19.217
It's your last chance, huh?

1:17:20.094 --> 1:17:21.428
Tell your men to follow me.

1:17:24.557 --> 1:17:25.724
Do as he says!

1:17:32.690 --> 1:17:34.316
"More than life itself."

1:17:46.078 --> 1:17:48.163
As he galloped along
the magic path,

1:17:48.372 --> 1:17:50.665
Perducas imagined a treasure
awaiting him.

1:17:50.875 --> 1:17:52.500
He cursed his men

1:17:52.710 --> 1:17:54.961
for having to share the bounty.

1:17:55.171 --> 1:17:57.047
He looked at Astrid,
and wondered

1:17:57.256 --> 1:17:59.090
if he preferred love to riches.

1:17:59.342 --> 1:18:01.551
At times,
the minds of men are troubled

1:18:01.969 --> 1:18:03.345
their creed vanishes,

1:18:03.554 --> 1:18:04.679
leaving only doubt.

1:18:04.889 --> 1:18:08.975
Meanwhile, Belle relived a tale
of the Prince becoming beast,

1:18:09.185 --> 1:18:11.770
till it woke her
in a chilling cry.

1:18:38.547 --> 1:18:39.714
Father!

1:18:44.804 --> 1:18:45.929
My child.

1:18:48.265 --> 1:18:49.474
Oh, father!

1:18:50.601 --> 1:18:52.227
I missed you so much.

1:18:54.188 --> 1:18:54.813
Belle!

1:18:57.066 --> 1:18:57.816
Father?

1:18:58.317 --> 1:18:59.275
Oh Heavens!

1:18:59.652 --> 1:19:01.361
Anne, Clotilde!

1:19:01.904 --> 1:19:03.446
Father has come to!

1:19:04.240 --> 1:19:05.990
I was so afraid!

1:19:08.202 --> 1:19:10.161
Something about you has changed.

1:19:10.913 --> 1:19:12.163
Your look.

1:19:14.625 --> 1:19:15.709
Your voice, too.

1:19:16.585 --> 1:19:18.044
I can't stay, father.

1:19:19.797 --> 1:19:21.256
I have to go back there.

1:19:28.597 --> 1:19:29.931
Look who is back from the dead!

1:19:30.141 --> 1:19:31.850
The happiest day of our lives!

1:19:33.978 --> 1:19:38.148
You girls are mad!
Oh, you're crushing me!

1:19:51.704 --> 1:19:52.620
Whoa!

1:20:08.471 --> 1:20:10.388
What are you feeling?

1:20:10.973 --> 1:20:12.056
Danger.

1:20:12.349 --> 1:20:14.601
I feel it. Everywhere.

1:20:21.567 --> 1:20:23.193
Just how we like it.

1:20:27.531 --> 1:20:28.448
Let's go.

1:20:28.866 --> 1:20:31.201
You three, go out west.

1:20:31.911 --> 1:20:34.704
The rest of you,
take the east flank.

1:20:35.247 --> 1:20:38.666
You, little bunnies,
go in front of me.

1:21:35.015 --> 1:21:37.058
Heavenly Astrid...

1:21:39.895 --> 1:21:41.312
Enough fear...

1:21:41.522 --> 1:21:42.856
Enough bloodshed...

1:21:43.190 --> 1:21:44.941
With all your strength,

1:21:45.150 --> 1:21:46.651
save your lover...
