22:51.256 --> 22:53.958
Not only do I have the fuel
of Kenny Powers inside of me,

22:53.992 --> 22:57.328

25:02.055 --> 25:04.223
It's a funny thing, Kenny.

25:04.257 --> 25:06.692
The VIN number on your truck,
matches Shane's VIN number.

25:08.661 --> 25:10.061
You don't even like him.

25:10.095 --> 25:12.063

When I unzipped my
pants and slipped my...

27:00.839 --> 27:03.808
Pixie stick into her
Barbie dream house.

27:03.842 --> 27:06.811
I thought I would blow
my Big League Chew.
