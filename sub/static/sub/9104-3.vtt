&lrm;Guess who's on a photo shoot in the park?

02:02.240 --> 02:05.320
&lrm;Now? Adrien is in the park right now?

02:05.480 --> 02:06.920
&lrm;As we speak.

02:07.080 --> 02:10.000
&lrm;Oh gosh. What...
&lrm;What am I going to say to him?

02:10.160 --> 02:11.640
&lrm;The same thing as usual...

02:11.800 --> 02:14.960
&lrm;-I... I.... Wh...
&lrm;-Stop it.

02:16.120 --> 02:17.680
&lrm;Who's she?

02:18.640 --> 02:21.320
&lrm;I forgot about this little detail.

02:21.480 --> 02:23.120
&lrm;And who's she?

02:23.280 --> 02:26.800
&lrm;Manon, my mom's friend's daughter.
&lrm;I'm babysitting all day.

02:26.960 --> 02:28.920
&lrm;[she gasps]
&lrm;Oh no, I can't go out.

02:29.080 --> 02:31.960
&lrm;Let me guess,
&lrm;another you-couldn't-say-no favor?

02:32.120 --> 02:33.800
&lrm;No... I just couldn't...

02:34.240 --> 02:36.120
&lrm;say... no.

02:36.520 --> 02:39.880
&lrm;Look, no problem.
&lrm;I'll look after your little detail.

02:40.040 --> 02:41.760
&lrm;[Manon giggles]

02:41.920 --> 02:44.120
&lrm;Thanks, but I'm responsible for her.

02:44.480 --> 02:47.080
&lrm;Besides, I couldn't do that to you,
&lrm;she's...

02:47.800 --> 02:48.920
&lrm;an absolute angel.

02:49.080 --> 02:50.480
&lrm;[crashing]

&lrm;[crashing and giggling continues]

03:02.240 --> 03:04.000
&lrm;You're a pushover, Marinette.

03:04.160 --> 03:06.320
&lrm;I babysit my sisters all the time,

03:06.480 --> 03:09.040
&lrm;which makes me an expert
&lrm;in dealing with "angels".

03:09.200 --> 03:11.080
&lrm;Who are you anyway?

03:11.560 --> 03:14.840
&lrm;I'm a mythical unicorn
&lrm;from the world of Reespa,

03:15.000 --> 03:17.560
&lrm;disguised
&lrm;as a totally fabulous human girl.

03:17.720 --> 03:22.160
&lrm;I grant magical wishes
&lrm;but only to little monkeys who behave.

03:22.320 --> 03:24.760
&lrm;[she giggles] No you're not...

03:25.320 --> 03:26.480
&lrm;are you?

&lrm;OK, let's all go to the park.

03:33.080 --> 03:34.760
&lrm;[Manon] Yay.

03:34.920 --> 03:36.760
&lrm;[cheerfully] OK.

03:38.880 --> 03:40.800
<i>&lrm;This is the moment we've been waiting for!</i>

<i>&lrm;And the new Kidz Plus Weathergirl is...</i>

03:46.840 --> 03:48.080
<i>&lrm;Mireille!</i>

03:48.240 --> 03:50.160
&lrm;[cheers and applause]

03:50.480 --> 03:52.760
&lrm;She crushed you. Better luck next time.

03:52.920 --> 03:54.000
&lrm;[she groans]

03:54.280 --> 03:58.040
&lrm;What's the big deal?
&lrm;You only lost by half a million votes.

03:58.400 --> 04:00.240
&lrm;[evil voice]
&lrm;The vibrations are so strong...

04:00.360 --> 04:03.680
&lrm;I can feel
&lrm;the imminent anger and sadness...

04:03.800 --> 04:06.240
&lrm;the moment of weakness of my next victim,

04:06.800 --> 04:09.200
&lrm;such easy prey for my Akuma.

04:22.840 --> 04:24.120
&lrm;[angry sighs]

04:24.280 --> 04:25.400
&lrm;[elevator beeps]

04:25.560 --> 04:26.960
&lrm;[sobbing]

04:29.760 --> 04:31.360
&lrm;[angrily] I should have won.

04:31.520 --> 04:34.280
&lrm;I had the talent, the star looks,
&lrm;everything!

04:34.440 --> 04:36.600
&lrm;But she took everything away from me.

04:36.760 --> 04:38.400
&lrm;They took everything away from me!

04:38.600 --> 04:41.720
&lrm;[fizzing]

04:44.320 --> 04:46.120
&lrm;[she squeals]

04:50.240 --> 04:52.320
&lrm;[evil voice] So correct you are.

04:52.480 --> 04:54.400
&lrm;You should have won, yes.

04:54.840 --> 04:57.040
&lrm;[angrily] I should have won, yes!

&lrm;I am Hawk Moth.

04:59.960 --> 05:04.120
&lrm;I give you the power to seek revenge
&lrm;on them as my Weathergirl.

05:04.400 --> 05:06.920
&lrm;All you have to do
&lrm;is bring me the Miraculous.

05:07.080 --> 05:08.560
&lrm;Can you do that?

05:09.120 --> 05:10.200
&lrm;Yes.

05:10.360 --> 05:11.760
&lrm;That's my Weathergirl.

05:12.360 --> 05:16.160
&lrm;Show the world
&lrm;who the best Weathergirl really is.

05:18.200 --> 05:19.160
&lrm;[camera clicks]

05:25.280 --> 05:27.680
&lrm;Come on.
&lrm;We'll stroll over there, real cool,

05:27.840 --> 05:30.120
&lrm;as if we just happened to be passing by.

05:30.280 --> 05:31.960
&lrm;-Then what?
&lrm;-Then...

05:32.120 --> 05:35.320
&lrm;I'll invite him for a smoothie
&lrm;after the shoot.

05:35.480 --> 05:38.560
&lrm;Then, we'll get married
&lrm;and live in a beautiful house,

05:38.720 --> 05:41.840
&lrm;have kids, a dog, maybe a cat...
&lrm;No, forget the cat.

05:42.000 --> 05:43.600
&lrm;A hamster, I love hamsters.

05:44.080 --> 05:45.040
&lrm;[she giggles]

05:45.200 --> 05:49.480
&lrm;Let's start with "passing by"
&lrm;and see if we can get to that smoothie.

05:49.640 --> 05:50.960
&lrm;[she giggles]

05:51.120 --> 05:52.280
&lrm;Magnifico, super.

05:52.440 --> 05:54.480
&lrm;I want to see hunger in your eyes.

05:56.040 --> 05:59.520
&lrm;[Marinette]
&lrm;Remember... cool, just be cool.

06:00.880 --> 06:03.280
&lrm;[Alya] We couldn't be more invisible.

06:03.440 --> 06:05.000

&lrm;Did you see that? He waved at me.

06:14.880 --> 06:16.280
&lrm;Yeah, I saw it too.

06:16.400 --> 06:18.960
&lrm;Pretty normal
&lrm;since we're in the same class.

06:19.120 --> 06:21.080

&lrm;But what about Adrien?

07:26.920 --> 07:29.200

&lrm;For all of you who voted for Mireille,

07:36.440 --> 07:38.480
&lrm;I'd advise you to move indoors.

07:38.640 --> 07:41.000
&lrm;It's going to get very blustery.

07:41.480 --> 07:43.880

&lrm;You don't know how to control her anyway.

09:23.160 --> 09:25.840
&lrm;No way! Marinette's my babysitter.

10:00.040 --> 10:03.160
&lrm;Tikki, spots on! Yeah!

10:17.320 --> 10:18.720
&lrm;[crowd screams]

10:18.880 --> 10:19.720
&lrm;[explosions]

10:20.200 --> 10:21.400
&lrm;Help!

10:21.800 --> 10:22.720
&lrm;[he gasps]

10:22.880 --> 10:24.160
&lrm;[explosions]

10:25.400 --> 10:26.920
&lrm;Plagg? Plagg!

10:27.120 --> 10:29.480
&lrm;I'm not here. I'm sleeping.

10:31.280 --> 10:32.640
&lrm;[excited cry]

10:33.680 --> 10:35.200
&lrm;[he sighs]

10:35.360 --> 10:38.720
&lrm;For your information,
&lrm;I can smell camembert in my sleep.

10:38.880 --> 10:40.560
&lrm;It's one of my many talents.

10:40.720 --> 10:43.000
&lrm;Great, but there's no time
&lrm;to talk cheese.

10:43.240 --> 10:44.880
&lrm;Plagg, claws out!

11:03.760 --> 11:06.440
&lrm;Why did I leave Manon?
&lrm;I should have never done that.

11:06.800 --> 11:10.360
&lrm;No, Alya's right.
&lrm;She's in good hands. I must trust her.

11:10.640 --> 11:12.200
&lrm;I'll get you out of here!

11:13.080 --> 11:16.640
&lrm;Let's wire-cut this icy cake.

11:19.760 --> 11:21.000
&lrm;[she groans]

11:21.400 --> 11:23.960
&lrm;Or not... On to plan B.

11:24.120 --> 11:26.080
&lrm;Don't worry. It will be OK.

11:26.480 --> 11:27.920
&lrm;Where's Marinette?

11:28.080 --> 11:29.640
&lrm;She hasn't forgotten you, Manon.

11:29.800 --> 11:31.640
&lrm;How did you know my name?

11:32.480 --> 11:34.000
&lrm;I... I... Marinette told me.

11:34.160 --> 11:35.560
&lrm;She's coming right back, OK?

11:37.240 --> 11:38.480
&lrm;[Ladybug chuckles]

11:41.160 --> 11:42.520
&lrm;[explosions]

11:43.040 --> 11:43.960
&lrm;Hey, Ice Queen.

11:44.120 --> 11:45.600
&lrm;What's with all the terrorizing?

11:45.760 --> 11:47.560
&lrm;Why don't you pick on someone
&lrm;your own temperature?

11:47.840 --> 11:51.160
&lrm;My name is not Ice Queen,
&lrm;it's Stormy Weather!

11:51.800 --> 11:55.760
&lrm;Listen, I'm feline
&lrm;more generous than usual, today.

11:55.960 --> 11:58.320
&lrm;So cool down, and we'll call it quits. 'K?

11:59.280 --> 12:00.400
&lrm;[blustering wind]

12:00.600 --> 12:03.280
&lrm;[Cat Noir yells]

12:03.440 --> 12:04.640
&lrm;[groaning]

12:06.360 --> 12:09.000
&lrm;I thought cats
&lrm;always landed on their feet.

12:09.320 --> 12:11.720
&lrm;Why thanks, M'Ladybug,
&lrm;but I had it covered.

12:11.880 --> 12:13.000
&lrm;[she gasps]

12:13.160 --> 12:16.600
&lrm;No time for your childish charm,
&lrm;Cat Noir, but you're welcome.

12:16.760 --> 12:20.560
&lrm;We should be expecting lightning storms,
&lrm;like, right now!

12:20.720 --> 12:23.400
&lrm;[zapping]

12:23.560 --> 12:28.280
&lrm;[thunder rumbles]

12:28.440 --> 12:29.680
&lrm;[they scream]

12:30.520 --> 12:31.680
&lrm;[exploding]

12:32.000 --> 12:33.760
&lrm;[they groan]

12:33.920 --> 12:35.120
&lrm;[they gasp]

12:38.760 --> 12:41.360
&lrm;You've just won yourself a catfight.

12:42.880 --> 12:44.320
&lrm;Black Ice!

12:49.520 --> 12:51.520
&lrm;[car alarms bleep]
&lrm;[she screams]

12:55.200 --> 12:56.400
&lrm;Gotcha!

12:58.360 --> 12:59.320
&lrm;[she gasps]

13:00.160 --> 13:01.680
&lrm;[she groans]

13:02.240 --> 13:05.120
&lrm;[blustering wind continues]
&lrm;[car alarms bleep]

13:05.280 --> 13:08.280
&lrm;[car alarms bleep]
&lrm;[crashing]

13:09.080 --> 13:10.400
&lrm;[zapping]
&lrm;[explosion]

13:14.280 --> 13:17.440
&lrm;A little Cat Noir
&lrm;will take the wind out of her sails.

13:17.920 --> 13:18.960
&lrm;[he groans]

13:19.120 --> 13:21.840
&lrm;Wow, kitty-kitty, think before you leap.

13:22.560 --> 13:24.880
&lrm;-You've got a plan?
&lrm;-Just follow my lead.

13:35.280 --> 13:36.760
&lrm;Not you again.

13:37.680 --> 13:40.400
&lrm;[blustering wind]
&lrm;[they scream]

13:40.560 --> 13:42.200
&lrm;[screaming]

13:43.400 --> 13:44.760
&lrm;[they groan]

13:45.320 --> 13:48.720
&lrm;[crashing]
&lrm;[panting]

13:55.920 --> 13:57.480
&lrm;[bus bell rings]

14:02.240 --> 14:03.160
&lrm;[crashing]

14:03.320 --> 14:06.000
&lrm;[bus bell dies out]

14:08.000 --> 14:10.200
&lrm;[he groans]
&lrm;[she giggles]

14:12.160 --> 14:13.680
&lrm;[Alya sings] Lemonade crunchy ice,

14:13.840 --> 14:15.840
&lrm;hit it once, hit it twice. Freeze!

14:17.040 --> 14:19.360
&lrm;Hey, no fair. You always win...

14:19.520 --> 14:20.840
&lrm;[ice cracks]

14:21.320 --> 14:22.560
&lrm;What was that?

14:22.880 --> 14:23.720
&lrm;It's...

14:24.640 --> 14:27.960
&lrm;It's the big Goblin King.
&lrm;He ate too much and split his shirt.

14:28.080 --> 14:29.800
&lrm;[she roars]

14:29.920 --> 14:31.320
&lrm;[giggling]

14:31.680 --> 14:34.040
&lrm;[rumbling]

14:35.040 --> 14:36.560
&lrm;Wanna hear a story?

14:39.720 --> 14:43.800
&lrm;You've shown them all
&lrm;who the real winner is, my Weathergirl,

14:43.920 --> 14:48.160
&lrm;but now is the time for you
&lrm;to fulfil your part of the agreement,

14:48.320 --> 14:50.000
&lrm;and here's my plan.

14:53.640 --> 14:55.080
&lrm;Maybe she's got anger issues.

14:56.000 --> 14:57.800
&lrm;Or she failed her driving test.

14:58.080 --> 14:59.760
<i>&lrm;Hello, viewers.</i>

15:00.240 --> 15:03.880
<i>&lrm;Here's the latest forecast</i>
<i>&lrm;for this first day of summer.</i>

15:04.400 --> 15:07.120
<i>&lrm;Looks like Mother Nature</i>
<i>&lrm;had a change in plans.</i>

15:07.280 --> 15:09.960
<i>&lrm;Summer vacation is officially over.</i>

15:10.120 --> 15:12.800
&lrm;Already?
&lrm;But I look so good in a swimsuit.

15:14.240 --> 15:15.920
&lrm;The cat suit will do, thanks.

15:16.080 --> 15:18.320
&lrm;At least now we know where to find her.

15:18.600 --> 15:22.040
<i>&lrm;Prepare for the worst weather ever</i>
<i>&lrm;with 10 ft. snowdrifts.</i>

15:22.640 --> 15:24.720
&lrm;Hey. That girl reminds me of someone.

15:24.880 --> 15:27.600
&lrm;It's her.
&lrm;The Akuma must be in her parasol.

15:28.760 --> 15:33.160
<i>&lrm;In Stormy Weather's world,</i>
<i>&lrm;it's Winter Wonderland, forever!</i>

15:33.320 --> 15:34.600
&lrm;[they roar]

15:37.560 --> 15:38.760
&lrm;It's a recording.

15:38.920 --> 15:40.520
&lrm;[cackling]

15:41.560 --> 15:42.600
&lrm;[zapping]

15:43.560 --> 15:44.840
&lrm;[they gasp]

15:50.000 --> 15:52.720
&lrm;This is all going
&lrm;wonderfully according to plan.

15:52.880 --> 15:55.480
&lrm;Soon their Miraculous will be mine.

15:55.640 --> 15:57.440
&lrm;[Hawk Moth] Bring them to me!

15:57.760 --> 15:59.560
&lrm;[cackling]

15:59.720 --> 16:01.960
&lrm;[Cat Noir]
&lrm;Frosty the Snowgirl's getting away.

16:02.600 --> 16:04.120
&lrm;Do I hear a damsel in distress?

16:04.280 --> 16:06.200
&lrm;[Ladybug]
&lrm;Some of us don't have night vision.

16:06.360 --> 16:08.360
&lrm;No need to bug out. Just trust me.

16:08.720 --> 16:12.160
&lrm;Then the cyclops monster picked
&lrm;the princess up and said,

16:12.280 --> 16:13.960
&lrm;"Look into my eye."

16:14.400 --> 16:15.360
&lrm;[Manon giggles]

16:15.520 --> 16:18.320
&lrm;Then she stuck a finger right in it.

16:18.640 --> 16:21.280
&lrm;As soon as she took a bite
&lrm;of the cursed potato,

16:21.400 --> 16:25.000
&lrm;the poor princess
&lrm;fell into a deep, deep sleep.

16:25.160 --> 16:27.200
&lrm;[creaking]
&lrm;[they gasp]

16:28.400 --> 16:30.360
&lrm;[fearfully] Hurry up, Ladybug.

16:34.560 --> 16:36.920
&lrm;[Ladybug] OK, I think I can manage to...

16:37.080 --> 16:38.120
&lrm;[Cat Noir] Duck!

16:38.600 --> 16:40.840
&lrm;[Ladybug]
&lrm;I'll follow your lead on this one

16:43.600 --> 16:45.840
&lrm;[cackling]

16:46.000 --> 16:49.320
&lrm;You airheads, you fell right into my trap.

16:57.880 --> 17:01.560
&lrm;The time is now. Bring me the Miraculous!

17:02.080 --> 17:05.440
&lrm;There's no way out! Party's over, fools.

17:05.599 --> 17:06.720
&lrm;We're just...

17:07.400 --> 17:08.480
&lrm;[he chuckles]

17:08.640 --> 17:10.760
&lrm;We're just getting started, Stormy.

17:11.079 --> 17:13.119
&lrm;Lucky charm!

17:18.520 --> 17:21.560
&lrm;A bath towel? What do I do with this?

17:21.680 --> 17:25.240
&lrm;Great. We're about to be obliterated
&lrm;but... at least we'll be dry.

17:25.359 --> 17:27.400
&lrm;Just hold your whiskers.

17:30.400 --> 17:31.400
&lrm;Hey!

17:39.120 --> 17:43.080
&lrm;So what's the plan?
&lrm;My arm's starting to get cramp.

17:54.080 --> 17:56.040
&lrm;See that sign? Check it out.

17:56.200 --> 17:57.480
&lrm;Alright!

17:57.760 --> 17:59.520
&lrm;Cataclysm!

18:04.120 --> 18:05.280
&lrm;Hey, Coldilocks,

18:05.520 --> 18:07.040
&lrm;is that all you've got?

18:47.160 --> 18:49.720
&lrm;[she squeals]

18:57.640 --> 18:59.760
&lrm;Get out of here, you nasty bug.

19:01.640 --> 19:03.960
&lrm;No more evil-doing for you, little Akuma.

19:07.360 --> 19:09.960
&lrm;Time to de-evilize!

19:12.720 --> 19:13.960
&lrm;Gotcha.

19:14.840 --> 19:17.000
&lrm;Bye-bye, little butterfly.

19:17.760 --> 19:19.360
&lrm;Miraculous, Ladybug!

19:19.520 --> 19:20.920
&lrm;[sparkling]

19:21.080 --> 19:23.040
&lrm;[whooshing]
&lrm;[sparkling]

19:31.640 --> 19:33.520
&lrm;[hissing]

19:33.680 --> 19:36.480
&lrm;And after defeating
&lrm;the three-headed dragon...

19:36.640 --> 19:38.080
&lrm;with taekwondo...

19:38.240 --> 19:40.560
&lrm;the princess kissed
&lrm;her Prince Charming and...

19:40.720 --> 19:42.480
&lrm;They lived happily ever after?

19:42.600 --> 19:43.760
&lrm;[hesitantly] Sure...

19:43.880 --> 19:48.400
&lrm;until they had little monkeys
&lrm;like you who drove them crazy.

19:48.520 --> 19:49.360
&lrm;[Manon chuckles]

19:52.000 --> 19:53.720
&lrm;[she gasps] What am I doing up here?

19:53.840 --> 19:55.240
&lrm;[together] Pound it.

19:55.920 --> 19:58.920
&lrm;Someday, your Miraculous will be all mine.

19:59.080 --> 20:03.400
&lrm;I don't care how many enemies I need
&lrm;to throw at you to win,

20:03.560 --> 20:05.160
&lrm;but I will be victorious!

20:09.400 --> 20:10.360
&lrm;[panting]

20:10.480 --> 20:13.920
&lrm;Hey, there's the photographer
&lrm;and Adrien waiting for you.

20:14.200 --> 20:15.800
&lrm;It's not too late?

20:15.960 --> 20:17.120
&lrm;Come on, Marinette,

20:17.280 --> 20:19.840
&lrm;you saved Manon
&lrm;and the whole world for that matter.

20:20.000 --> 20:21.040
&lrm;Have some fun.

20:21.200 --> 20:22.480
&lrm;[Manon] Marinette!

20:23.280 --> 20:25.200
&lrm;[giggling]

20:25.560 --> 20:27.600
&lrm;I know what your secret is.

20:28.000 --> 20:30.080
&lrm;Wh... What secret?

20:30.240 --> 20:32.440
&lrm;Ladybug is your best friend.

20:32.600 --> 20:35.680
&lrm;That's how you always know
&lrm;what the other one's gonna do.

20:35.840 --> 20:37.160
&lrm;[relieved sigh]

20:40.080 --> 20:42.560
&lrm;Can I have a lollipop? Can I?

20:42.720 --> 20:45.520
&lrm;-Can I? Can I?
&lrm;-No, Manon. I've something to do.

20:45.680 --> 20:47.440
&lrm;Alya, you'll watch her, yeah?

20:49.880 --> 20:51.840
&lrm;I'm ready for the photo shoot.

20:52.000 --> 20:54.800
&lrm;Wait. Who iz zat... angel?

20:58.720 --> 21:01.760
&lrm;[photographer giggles] Angel... magnifico.

21:03.000 --> 21:04.480
&lrm;[Marinette sighs]

21:04.640 --> 21:07.000
&lrm;[photographer giggles]
