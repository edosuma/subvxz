00:02.001 --> 00:05.546
[Tool Clicking] [Frank] You gotta
be careful of the wire, Charlie.

00:05.631 --> 00:07.799
[Charlie] I'm not gonna pinch the wire.
I know what I'm doing.

00:07.925 --> 00:10.009
'Cause then the brake lights don't work.
I know what I'm doing.

00:10.135 --> 00:12.637
Make sure it's on tight.
It's on as tight as it's gonna get!

00:12.721 --> 00:14.180
Okay. All right.
It's on good and tight.

00:14.264 --> 00:16.181
Hey, Dennis, I think we should
get, like, a G.P.S. System,

00:16.308 --> 00:19.185
'cause these maps are from, like, the '70s, dude.
G.P.S. System? Oh, hell, no!

00:19.311 --> 00:21.229
No? That's gonna ruin the
road trip experience.

00:21.313 --> 00:25.191
We gotta go do this old school, baby.
Maps, fresh cigarettes, fresh coffee,

00:25.317 --> 00:27.694
cooking out on the grill, sleeping
in sleeping bags. Old school.

00:27.820 --> 00:29.278
Old school, baby!
I'm into that!

00:29.405 --> 00:30.488
Campfire.
Let's do old school!

00:30.614 --> 00:31.781
Old school, yeah!
Oh, shit. [Horn Honks]

00:31.865 --> 00:34.367
- Oh, shit.
- Who is that? That Sweet Dee?

00:34.493 --> 00:36.160
That's Dee.
That's Sweet Dee.

00:36.245 --> 00:37.578
Oh, goddamn it.
What is that car?

00:37.663 --> 00:39.247
What is she doing here?
[Charlie] What car is that?

00:39.331 --> 00:41.249
Ah, shit. Okay, don't- don't-
Just don't say anything.

00:41.375 --> 00:43.584
Hey, guys. What's with the trailer?
[Mac] Hey.

00:43.669 --> 00:45.545
None of your business.
What are you doing here so early?

00:45.629 --> 00:48.548
- Why are you at work early? - I woke up early
this morning and went and bought a new car.

00:48.632 --> 00:50.007
It's pretty sweet.
Where you guys going?

00:50.092 --> 00:52.760
- We're going to the Grand Canyon.
- Goddamn it, Frank!

00:52.845 --> 00:54.804
- Really? - Frank wants to
see it before he dies, so...

00:54.888 --> 00:57.890
Yeah, what happened was he told us
about a road trip. We got all excited.

00:57.975 --> 00:59.892
We got up super early
and we packed the car...

01:00.018 --> 01:03.312
- and were hoping to get out of here before your bus arrived.
- You were just gonna ditch me?

01:03.397 --> 01:05.440
Nah, it's cool.
I'm gonna stick around.

01:05.566 --> 01:07.734
Yeah. Charlie's too scared. Yeah.
He's never left Philly before.

01:07.818 --> 01:09.861
I'm not scared!
I just haven't left Philly.

01:09.987 --> 01:11.779
Why leave Philly, you know?
He's frightened.

01:11.864 --> 01:13.322
- I want to go.
- No, you're not going.

01:13.407 --> 01:15.032
You can't come
'cause it'll take forever.

01:15.117 --> 01:17.201
Yeah, and you're gonna have to pee every
five minutes. It's gonna be stupid.

01:17.286 --> 01:18.953
I'm not gonna get stuck
behind with Charlie.

01:19.037 --> 01:21.748
Wait a second! If you go, I'm gonna
be all by myself in the bar.

01:21.832 --> 01:24.751
That's messed up, guys. I mean, that's
more change than, like, even if I went.

01:24.835 --> 01:27.044
- You know what? Maybe I should go.
- Great. We're all in.

01:27.171 --> 01:29.213
It's gonna be packed in the car!
No, we're not all in.

01:29.298 --> 01:32.133
- Yeah, we're going.
- We're going on a road trip, baby!

01:32.217 --> 01:34.677
Why did you have to buy
a new car today of all days?

01:34.762 --> 01:36.554
I'll go get my stuff.

02:09.670 --> 02:11.464
[Dee] I can't believe you've never
been out of Philly, Charlie.

02:11.590 --> 02:14.050
Yeah, man. What the hell?
I've never done a lot of things.

02:14.176 --> 02:17.386
What else have you not done, bro?
Uh, I've never eaten a pear.

02:17.513 --> 02:19.847
What? How is that possible?
Seriously.

02:19.973 --> 02:22.558
Really? Pears weird me out, dude.
Where do you start with a pear?

02:22.684 --> 02:25.102
The top, the bottom?
What do you mean, where do you start?

02:25.187 --> 02:27.104
Just bite into it. It's a fruit.
You just start it.

02:27.189 --> 02:29.273
Really? You just bite it?
It's a weird-looking thing.

02:29.358 --> 02:31.400
Okay, you know what?
Pull over. I'm getting this kid a pear.

02:31.527 --> 02:33.778
No, no. No pulling over!
We've got a schedule. Yeah, no, no.

02:33.862 --> 02:35.613
I would love to take a quick leak.
Are you serious?

02:35.697 --> 02:36.823
Oh, Deandra!
We just left!

02:36.907 --> 02:38.407
That's what
I was worried about.

02:38.492 --> 02:40.576
And it can't just be any pear, dude.
It's gotta be a fresh one.

02:40.702 --> 02:42.411
Let's go to the Italian market.
Oh, okay.

02:42.538 --> 02:44.580
Hey-oh! The Italian market
is way out of our way.

02:44.706 --> 02:46.165
Nah.
Dennis, do you have to smoke?

02:46.250 --> 02:47.959
It's coming right back
in through my window.

02:48.043 --> 02:50.294
Roll your window up then,
Dee, 'cause I'm a-smoking.

02:50.379 --> 02:52.088
The window needs to be
down for the fresh air.

02:52.214 --> 02:54.131
Hey, I've never had
blueberries either. What?

02:54.216 --> 02:55.967
What are you talking about?
That's crazy!

02:56.051 --> 02:58.427
That is completely insane.
We're definitely going to the Italian market.

02:58.554 --> 03:00.304
Dennis, let's go.
You believe this guy? Jesus!

03:00.389 --> 03:01.931
- What guy?
- Guy on the bike.

03:02.015 --> 03:03.516
He's taking up
the whole goddamn road.

03:03.600 --> 03:06.435
Ride on the sidewalk if you're
gonna ride a bike, asshole!

03:06.520 --> 03:08.187
[Honking] What was that?

03:08.313 --> 03:10.189
He flicked you off, dude.
Is that what that was?

03:10.315 --> 03:11.774
He flicked you off, man.
Son of a bitch.

03:11.900 --> 03:13.985
Real chip on his shoulder, huh?
You wanna egg him?

03:14.069 --> 03:15.945
Yeah, I wanna egg him.
You got eggs?

03:16.071 --> 03:18.072
No. That would have been good though.
That would've been good, man.

03:18.156 --> 03:20.992
You know what? I'm gonna fire a beer
across his bow. Ruffle his feathers.

03:21.118 --> 03:23.035
Yeah, give him a good scare?
Yeah, man.

03:23.161 --> 03:25.413
[Dee] Yeah. Jerk.
Get up real close to him.

03:25.497 --> 03:27.707
Hey, asshole.
Ooh!

03:27.791 --> 03:29.625
Oh, shit!

03:31.503 --> 03:33.337
[All] Oh!

03:33.463 --> 03:35.506
Shit!
I hit him! I hit him!

03:35.591 --> 03:37.592
You hit him in the back of the head!
I didn't mean to.

03:37.676 --> 03:39.969
- That is not how I expected
that to go at all. - Is he okay?

03:40.053 --> 03:42.221
- Did we kill him?
- I don't know. Oh, he's getting up.

03:42.347 --> 03:44.181
[Frank] He's moving, he's moving.
[Mac] Yeah, he's getting up.

03:44.308 --> 03:46.183
Thank God, dude. God.
Should we help him out?

03:46.310 --> 03:48.603
[Mac] And he's getting something out of his bag.
[Dennis] What's he getting?

03:48.729 --> 03:51.772
It's a pipe. It's a pipe?
Go, go, go, go, go!

03:51.857 --> 03:54.650
- [Dee] Go, go, go, go!
- [All Shouting At Once]

03:54.735 --> 03:57.278
What's wrong with your tires?
The car's scraping.

03:57.362 --> 03:59.947
[Charlie] All right, get back to the bar.
Get back to the bar.

04:01.825 --> 04:03.826
Damn it!

04:05.037 --> 04:06.871
Goddamn it!
Shit!

04:06.997 --> 04:09.457
These tires are completely destroyed.
Ah, shit!

04:09.541 --> 04:11.751
I'm just gonna pop inside
real quick, take a quick squirt.

04:11.877 --> 04:14.420
Unbelievable. How about we put a
couple of doughnuts on there?

04:14.504 --> 04:17.548
Oh, right, Frank. We're gonna go to
the Grand Canyon on spare tires.

04:17.632 --> 04:21.886
Uh, plus there's a good deal of
mountain bike in your axle here, bro.

04:22.012 --> 04:24.764
[Dennis] Seriously, dude? Yeah.
We're talking structural damage down there.

04:24.848 --> 04:26.515
There's leakage.
Things are sparking.

04:26.642 --> 04:29.518
All right. Well, road trip's off.
No, no, no, no, no.

04:29.603 --> 04:33.397
Road trip's not off.
I have a good idea.

04:45.077 --> 04:46.243
Not bad, right?
Nah.

04:46.370 --> 04:48.245
It's kinda nice.
Lot of leg room.

04:48.372 --> 04:50.289
It's a smooth ride.
You guys got a lot of room back there?

04:50.415 --> 04:52.416
Oh, yeah. We got easy
access to the beers too.

04:52.542 --> 04:54.418
I mean, that's a good touch.
New car smell.

04:54.544 --> 04:56.796
Mmm. How do you get that in a used car?
What is that?

04:56.880 --> 04:58.297
It's a spray.
Yeah, it's a spray.

04:58.382 --> 04:59.757
Oh, yeah.
It's nice.

04:59.883 --> 05:01.801
I enjoy it, man.
I'm glad that they did that. It's nice.

05:01.885 --> 05:04.720
I wish that this light would hurry up and change.
That's the only thing. Uh-oh!

05:04.805 --> 05:08.516
- Hey! Hey, you bastards!
- [All Groan]

05:08.642 --> 05:10.768
You jerks! Hey! Hey!
[Dennis] Ah, here we go.

05:10.894 --> 05:13.145
Goddamn it! Get out!
[Charlie] All right.

05:13.271 --> 05:15.690
All right, all right, all right.
It's my car. I'm driving. Get out!

05:15.816 --> 05:17.316
I got window!
Get out!

05:17.401 --> 05:18.567
[Charlie]
You call window, Frank?

05:18.652 --> 05:20.236
You jerks!
I got window.

05:20.362 --> 05:22.947
[Dee] You guys are dicks.
It took you long enough.

05:23.073 --> 05:25.241
You were taking forever!
Did you still want to go?

05:25.325 --> 05:27.743
Shut up! It's really cramped
back here with this cooler.

05:27.828 --> 05:29.745
Why don't you put
the cooler in the trailer?

05:29.830 --> 05:33.082
Because then, Dee, we're gonna have to pull
over every single time we want a beer.

05:33.166 --> 05:35.710
That new car smell is starting to give me a headache.
Dennis, give me a cigarette.

05:35.836 --> 05:37.211
You want a cigarette?
Yeah.

05:37.295 --> 05:39.255
I'm gonna have one too.
Do you guys have to smoke in here?

05:39.339 --> 05:41.257
Yeah- Well, your car reeks, Dee, so-
[Blows Raspberry]

05:41.341 --> 05:43.050
God, dude, this thing
is so heavy!

05:43.176 --> 05:44.760
I'm gonna get a blood clot
with this thing! Oh, my God!

05:44.845 --> 05:46.387
Why don't you put it
in the trailer?

05:46.513 --> 05:49.432
Why don't I put you in the trailer?
Good one, Charlie.

05:49.516 --> 05:51.726
That's actually not a bad idea.
I wouldn't mind riding back there.

05:51.852 --> 05:54.228
There's a hell of a lot more room.
I'm done with that.

05:54.312 --> 05:56.397
[Both Exclaim] [Dee] Oh, come on!

05:56.523 --> 05:59.525
Oh, it's in my- Get it!
You're gonna burn a hole in the new upholstery!

05:59.609 --> 06:01.944
It's not new upholstery.
What makes you think it's new upholstery?

06:02.070 --> 06:03.654
Did you get it?
Oh, yeah!

06:03.780 --> 06:05.489
This sucks! Deandra, pull over.
This is terrible.

06:05.615 --> 06:07.324
I wanna go in the back with Dennis.
Yeah.

06:07.451 --> 06:10.619
You guys ride in back, and we'll- Yeah.
We'll go in the back.

06:14.583 --> 06:16.834
Mmm. This is more like it,
huh, Frank?

06:16.918 --> 06:18.627
Got a lot of room back here.

06:18.712 --> 06:22.006
It's muggy back here. Muggy.
My glands are starting to swell up.

06:22.132 --> 06:24.884
Yeah. Well, maybe we crack
that door a little bit.

06:24.968 --> 06:27.178
What? And go flying out at the first corner?
I don't think so, buddy.

06:27.262 --> 06:29.096
Well, just to crack it-
just a little bit.

06:29.181 --> 06:30.598
- You want to crack it?
- Yeah, we'll crack it.

06:30.682 --> 06:33.434
- Crack it.
- Whoa. It's hard to stand up back here.

06:33.518 --> 06:36.687
Furniture is what we need.
We'll pick some up at the Italian market.

06:36.772 --> 06:38.981
When's the last time you saw
furniture in an Italian market?

06:39.107 --> 06:41.400
Those people will sell you anything.
They'll sell you their children. They don't care.

06:41.485 --> 06:43.736
- Provolone and salami.
- They sell everything at the Italian market.

06:43.820 --> 06:46.072
These people are like
descendants of Gypsies.

06:46.156 --> 06:48.407
They come in. They sell their shit.
They bang each other.

06:48.492 --> 06:51.577
I don't know what they do, but you get
to haggle with them. It's a lot of fun.

06:51.661 --> 06:55.039
- In the meantime, I'll prop this beer
bottle under the door. - All right.

06:55.123 --> 06:59.043
That's good.
[Groans] Yeah.

06:59.169 --> 07:00.711
Uh-
There we go.

07:00.837 --> 07:04.131
Perfect. Now, the weight of the door
will keep the beer bottle in place.

07:04.216 --> 07:06.509
Good.

07:06.635 --> 07:09.053
Nice, huh? Move over a little bit.
Let me sit on the cooler.

07:12.015 --> 07:14.517
Goddamn it!

07:14.601 --> 07:18.062
All right, now this I can get into.
You know? A little space back here.

07:18.146 --> 07:20.898
You guys want to listen to some tunes?
Got some CDs from Dennis here.

07:21.024 --> 07:24.693
Hate to break it to you, but there's no
CD player in here. Are you shitting me?

07:24.820 --> 07:27.029
No. Why would you buy a
car with no CD player?

07:27.155 --> 07:29.698
Because the guy knocked 50 bucks off.
So you had the option?

07:29.825 --> 07:32.201
Yeah, I had the option! Oh, my God!
And you went with the tape deck?

07:32.327 --> 07:34.036
Yes, I did, Charlie!
That is so cheap, Dee!

07:34.162 --> 07:36.956
You're cheap! Why did you buy this
crappy little car in the first place?

07:37.040 --> 07:40.042
Because you guys rammed my last
one into a wall! That's why.

07:40.127 --> 07:42.044
Whatever.
What tapes do you have?

07:42.129 --> 07:44.296
Tapes?
Who has tapes anymore?

07:44.381 --> 07:47.341
I would've thought that you would've
at least made a mix for the road trip.

07:47.425 --> 07:49.677
You didn't invite me
on your road trip!

07:49.761 --> 07:51.637
You don't keep
a good mix tape in your car?

07:51.763 --> 07:53.556
I just bought the car this morning, Charlie!
Okay! All right!

07:53.682 --> 07:55.724
Are you going to yell the whole
way there, Dee? Jesus Christ.

07:55.851 --> 07:57.726
Just shut up and turn the radio on.
Yeah, put the radio on.

07:57.853 --> 07:59.645
Just turn the radio on!

I'm trying.

08:01.690 --> 08:04.483
The antenna is probably broken on this piece of shit car!
It's static. Find a station.

08:04.609 --> 08:06.485
You're a piece of shit...
car. Wait a second.

08:06.611 --> 08:08.904
There's a tape right down here, I think.
You got a tape?

08:09.030 --> 08:10.573
Yeah, it's under the seat.
Give it to me. Gimme.

08:10.699 --> 08:12.241
It's jammed in the corner of the seat.
Give it to me.

08:12.367 --> 08:14.785
I'm trying to give it- Gimme, gimme,
gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme,

08:14.911 --> 08:16.871

08:30.135 --> 08:31.760
Yeah.
Quickly.

08:38.476 --> 08:41.061
All right, I'm gonna run to the
ladies' room for two seconds.

08:41.188 --> 08:44.063
I'm gonna take my keys in case
you jerks try anything. Really?

08:44.149 --> 08:47.651
All right, Charlie. Get ready to scratch
two things off of your bucket list.

08:47.736 --> 08:50.154
Oh, I don't have a bucket list,
dude, 'cause I'm not dying.

08:50.238 --> 08:52.573
Everybody's dying, bitch.
Let's get you some fruit.

08:52.657 --> 08:55.034
Guys, we're gonna go grab some
furniture to throw in the back.

08:55.118 --> 08:57.203
Ten minutes. That's all.
And we meet back here.

08:57.329 --> 08:59.705
Well, yeah. But get a good deal.
I mean, talk to the guy. Barter.

08:59.831 --> 09:01.540
There's no rush, right?
Ten. Ten minutes.

09:01.666 --> 09:04.210
Have fun, man. Have fun.
Uh, I've never had a strawberry either.

09:04.294 --> 09:06.378
That's astounding.

09:06.463 --> 09:08.380
Oh, Charlie,
I'm excited for you, bro.

09:08.465 --> 09:10.174
Hey!
Pears.

09:10.300 --> 09:12.343
Nice! Yes. One of nature's
most delectable fruits.

09:12.469 --> 09:14.011
Mmm. Mm-hmm.
Excuse me, sir.

09:14.137 --> 09:16.055
How much for this?
Those are 50 cents.

09:16.139 --> 09:18.891
Well, I won't pay full price.
So I'll give you a dime.

09:19.017 --> 09:21.310
They're 50 cents, buddy. Very well.
I'll drop you a quarter.

09:21.436 --> 09:23.062
No.
Okay. Thirty-five cents.

09:23.146 --> 09:25.439
I don't have time for this friggin' shit.
Give me the 35.

09:25.523 --> 09:27.399
Hey, yeah!
Nice, man.

09:27.484 --> 09:28.734
I talked you down.
Good barter.

09:28.818 --> 09:29.902
There you go.
Good barter.

09:29.986 --> 09:31.445
All right, Bozo. Thank you.

09:31.571 --> 09:34.323
I'm calling a lot of people Bozo now.
It's like my new thing. Dude.

09:34.449 --> 09:36.450
Chomp into it. Yeah.
Just bite it?

09:36.576 --> 09:39.370
Okay. Like a piece of fruit.
You would bite into it...

09:39.454 --> 09:42.081
[Groans] Tastes like sand.

09:42.165 --> 09:43.374
Like sand?

09:43.458 --> 09:45.876
Oh, that-
that pear's not ripe, dude.

09:46.002 --> 09:48.587
Ah. He burned us.
Gypsy son of a bitch burned us.

09:48.672 --> 09:51.632
Excuse me, sir?
What are you doing to my friend, Bozo?

09:51.758 --> 09:54.301
You burned us. It's dry.
You picked it out.

09:54.386 --> 09:58.347
Well, let's not get into a whole "who picked out what.
" I want my 35 cents back.

09:58.431 --> 10:00.933
- Charlie, give him the pear.
- I can't. I just ate it.

10:01.059 --> 10:04.436
The whole thing?
Yeah. It was pretty gross.

10:04.521 --> 10:06.313
The stem and then-
and the core?

10:06.398 --> 10:07.940
You didn't tell me not
to eat the stem, dude!

10:08.066 --> 10:10.651
Did you eat the stickers that are all over it?
Yeah, it was gross!

10:10.735 --> 10:12.569
Of course it's gross!
It's a sticker, bro!

10:12.696 --> 10:15.281
I eat stickers all the time, dude!
Oh, my God.

10:15.365 --> 10:18.284
This whole thing is a disaster.
I'm going back to the car.

10:18.410 --> 10:20.619
Come on. Let's go. I don't know.
They got a lot of good stuff here.

10:20.704 --> 10:22.329
I like the rocking chair.
Very nice.

10:22.414 --> 10:24.748
But I do like those wicker chairs.
They might be more forgiving on my bottom.

10:24.874 --> 10:26.750
Good. It's a tough decision though.
I don't know.

10:26.876 --> 10:29.461
Well, make one, Den.
Make one, please. Make a decision?

10:29.546 --> 10:32.631
Um, sir? Hi. We're interested
in these wicker chairs,

10:32.716 --> 10:34.925
but we're totally unwilling
to pay full price for them, so...

10:35.051 --> 10:36.969
You're gonna barter with the guy?
Yeah.

10:37.053 --> 10:40.014
We're not gonna barter with him.
We're not bartering. We'll pay full price.

10:40.098 --> 10:41.515
Get the wicker chairs.
No, no, no, no, no. Frank.

10:41.599 --> 10:43.517
Come on. The Gypsy wants to barter.
Let's barter with him.

10:43.643 --> 10:46.145
We don't have time to barter.
All right. We'll pay full price for...

10:46.229 --> 10:48.147
Whoa.
Is that a French press?

10:48.231 --> 10:50.024
Sir, how much for that
fine-looking French press?

10:50.108 --> 10:52.276
We don't need
a French press, Dennis.

10:52.402 --> 10:54.820
What, do you expect me to drink gas station
coffee all the way to the Grand Canyon?

10:54.904 --> 10:58.157
I don't think so, asshole. Sir, the man
will pay full price for the French press,

10:58.241 --> 11:01.744
or I will, however, be willing to
barter with you for a very long time.

11:01.828 --> 11:03.412
- Full price.
- Great!

11:03.496 --> 11:05.205
Hey, you guys seen anybody
selling cassette tapes?

11:05.290 --> 11:07.708
Deandra, what the hell are you doing?
What are you drinking?

11:07.792 --> 11:10.753
It's an energy drink. You guys are drinking beer.
I gotta tweak on something.

11:10.879 --> 11:13.839
You're gonna be pissing
every 15 feet. Nah!

11:13.923 --> 11:16.592
I know what I'm doing.
I'm buying you a piss jar. Ooh!

11:16.676 --> 11:18.635
Hold on a second.
I think I see some tapes down there.

11:18.762 --> 11:21.388
I'm gonna go barter with that guy.
Barter with the Gypsy.

11:21.473 --> 11:24.725
Dude, I'm telling you, it's black to yellow.
And no one ever uses...

11:24.851 --> 11:27.394
Black to yellow? No, dude. It's blue to something.
You never let me do this, okay?

11:27.520 --> 11:29.104
And hurry up, man.
It's blue to something.

11:29.189 --> 11:31.774
Just use the black to yellow, and
the car will start. Oh, shit!

11:31.858 --> 11:34.109
You guys, check it out.
I found this Soul Asylum tape,

11:34.194 --> 11:36.904
and I totally talked the guy down
to, like, half the asking price.

11:37.030 --> 11:38.822
Yeah.
Oh, goddamn it!

11:38.907 --> 11:40.783
Yeah. There was a bunch
of wires hanging down,

11:40.909 --> 11:43.285
and I was trying to put them back
up into- Shut up! Just shut up!

11:43.370 --> 11:44.995
Here's your piss jar.

11:45.080 --> 11:47.748
Yo, Frank, I'm gonna hop in the back with Dennis.
You want to switch with me?

11:47.874 --> 11:51.085
Switch-ola? They're gonna argue the whole way.
I don't wanna listen to it.

11:51.211 --> 11:53.962
No, I don't like it in there anyway.
All right.

11:55.924 --> 11:59.093
- Hey, you want a cup of joe, my man?
- Oh, yeah, definitely, dude.

11:59.219 --> 12:02.513
I got a pipin'-hot one ready for you right now.
Hook me up, bro.

12:02.639 --> 12:04.723
Hook me up!
All right. [Laughs]

12:04.808 --> 12:07.893
That's a pretty sweet duct tape rig
you got going on the door, man.

12:07.977 --> 12:10.104
[Dennis] You like that? Taped the chairs
down too, so they don't slide any.

12:10.188 --> 12:12.689
I know, but you stopped at the grill,
and that's got me confused.

12:12.774 --> 12:15.692
- Ran out of tape actually. - Oh, right.
It's not gonna slide through the crack?

12:15.819 --> 12:18.946
It won't because I measured the crack, and the
crack is smaller than the height of the grill.

12:19.030 --> 12:20.823
- We are all hooked up here, dude.
- Mmm.

12:20.949 --> 12:25.536
Now, are you nervous at all about leaving Philly?
Like, is anything bad gonna happen?

12:25.620 --> 12:28.914
[Chuckles] I don't think so, man.
I'm excited about it.

12:28.998 --> 12:31.667
I've just never been outside of Philly.
I don't know what people are like.

12:31.751 --> 12:34.503
- Well, people are people.
- Nobody's gonna be, like, a dick?

12:34.587 --> 12:36.588
There are probably gonna be some
dicks out there. Yeah, sure.

12:36.714 --> 12:40.342
But I'll be there. I'll back you up, man.
Hey, thanks, man.

12:40.468 --> 12:43.554
I tell you what will help. Shotgun a beer?
That'll calm my nerves.

12:43.680 --> 12:46.014
It sure will.
Let's do that.

12:53.314 --> 12:55.232
[Mac] I'm bored.
[Dee] Yeah.

12:55.316 --> 12:58.444
Let's play a drinking game.
Name all 50 states. Drink while you think.

12:58.528 --> 13:00.404
That's gonna suck.
I'm not drinking.

13:00.530 --> 13:03.365
Frank, will you drive for a little bit?
I've been drinking all day.

13:03.491 --> 13:06.368
[Mutters] Fine.
Uh, go. Maine.

13:06.494 --> 13:07.911
Uh, New Hampshire.
Vermont.

13:08.037 --> 13:09.329
Philly.
North Virginia.

13:09.456 --> 13:11.331
South Virginia.
East Virginia.

13:11.458 --> 13:13.917
Uh, South Virginia.
Did I say that already? Yes.

13:14.043 --> 13:16.044
Are you guys shitting me?
Shit. All right. Start over.

13:16.129 --> 13:18.046
No, I'm not gonna start over.
I was right. The game sucks.

13:18.131 --> 13:19.840
It's the drinking
that's the amusing part.

13:22.969 --> 13:25.387
I got an idea.

13:26.848 --> 13:29.266
Georgia. That's six.

13:29.350 --> 13:33.187
Oh. I was gonna-
No.

13:33.271 --> 13:35.564
[Laughs] Jesus Christ.

13:35.648 --> 13:40.319
You guys are gonna be hammered before
I'm finished naming the East Coast.

13:40.445 --> 13:43.113
Bro, I gotta cook up some hot dogs, man.
All right.

13:43.198 --> 13:45.115
I got a proposition for you, man.
Check this out.

13:45.200 --> 13:47.618
What do you say we smash
these wicker chairs to bits,

13:47.702 --> 13:50.078
put them in the middle
of the U-Haul- which is metal...

13:50.163 --> 13:52.164
and we burn the wicker chairs
and cook the hot dogs on that?

13:52.248 --> 13:54.958
What do you mean?
Cook the hot dogs over the fire?

13:55.043 --> 13:58.170
And then we'll get some new wicker chairs
next time we're at a Gypsy hangout spot.

13:58.254 --> 14:00.672
Okay. You think we're gonna be
going to a lot of those?

14:00.798 --> 14:04.343
'Cause I feel like I already dodged a
bullet once today. What do you mean?

14:04.469 --> 14:08.889
Well, I mean, you know, Gypsies- I don't
want anyone shrinking my head and shit.

14:08.973 --> 14:11.099
Yeah. Yeah.
Well, first of all,

14:11.184 --> 14:13.101
it was not Gypsies ever
that did that.

14:13.186 --> 14:15.103
That's sort of
a witch doctor thing.

14:15.188 --> 14:18.232
But either way, neither one
of them can shrink heads.

14:18.358 --> 14:22.569
Let's burn the chairs. All right.
A couple hot dogs will calm me down.

14:22.695 --> 14:25.572
Thanks for driving.
I really appreciate the ride.

14:25.657 --> 14:27.741
Yeah.

14:27.825 --> 14:30.744
[Slurring] So you're
headed to Hollywood, huh?

14:30.828 --> 14:32.913
Yeah.

14:32.997 --> 14:35.415
Oh, my God.

14:35.500 --> 14:38.168
Oh, my God. You're running
away from home, aren't you?

14:38.253 --> 14:41.088
Um, yeah, maybe.
Kinda.

14:41.172 --> 14:43.757
Oh, no, no, no.

14:43.841 --> 14:47.594
Sweet baby, they are gonna
eat you alive in Hollywood.

14:47.679 --> 14:50.389
[Gasps] Oh, you're definitely
gonna end up doing gay porn...

14:50.515 --> 14:53.308
with this tiny little
body of yours. No.

14:53.393 --> 14:55.936
Oh, man, kid.

14:56.020 --> 14:58.021
I'll be fine.

14:58.106 --> 15:00.440
I've actually got an uncle
out there that's...

15:00.525 --> 15:03.735
Shh.

15:05.154 --> 15:07.656
I got something you need
to hear about.

15:08.992 --> 15:11.201
Hold on a second.

15:11.327 --> 15:16.331
[Cassette Clicks] [Soul Asylum] # Just
easier than dealin' with the pain #

15:16.416 --> 15:19.751
[With Cassette] # Runaway
train never comin' back #

15:19.836 --> 15:23.589
# Wrong way on a one-way track #.

15:23.673 --> 15:28.093
Right. I've actually got this
uncle out there that said that...

15:28.177 --> 15:32.306
# Seems like I'm neither
here nor there #

15:32.390 --> 15:36.268
# Runaway train
tearin' up the- the track #

15:36.352 --> 15:40.272
# Runaway train
tearin' up the track #

15:40.356 --> 15:44.776
## [Continues] [Slurring] Shit.

15:44.861 --> 15:48.113
[Gasps] What is that?

15:48.197 --> 15:50.449
Is that piss? Is that piss?

15:50.575 --> 15:53.243
Pull over! You might as well pull over.
He's just gonna keep yelling.

15:53.328 --> 15:55.245
Pull over, you little dick!

15:55.330 --> 15:56.747
[Groans] Stop the car!

15:56.873 --> 15:58.123
Piss!
You know what?

15:58.207 --> 16:00.876
Jesus Christ, Dee!
I'm covered in piss!

16:00.960 --> 16:02.878
Well, maybe you shouldn't
have had your window down!

16:02.962 --> 16:05.505
Maybe you shouldn't be throwing
jars of pee out the window!

16:05.632 --> 16:07.799
Maybe I should, maybe I shouldn't.
It's up for debate. You shouldn't!

16:07.884 --> 16:09.676
Hey, what the hell is that?

16:10.720 --> 16:13.055
[Mac Coughs, Spits] Oh!

16:13.139 --> 16:15.891
Oh! Oh.
[Coughing]

16:19.145 --> 16:21.063
Holy shit!

16:27.487 --> 16:31.573
Damn. It's dark, and we haven't
even left Philly yet. [Coughing]

16:31.658 --> 16:34.409
I'm so sorry, dude.
I don't know what happened, man.

16:34.494 --> 16:38.121
It's like, we lit the chairs, and there must've
been a glaze on the wicker or something.

16:38.247 --> 16:40.248
Yeah. 'Cause, like, we
passed out instantly.

16:40.333 --> 16:43.710
- Some sort of a poison glaze.
- What are we, 20 minutes away from the bar?

16:43.795 --> 16:46.338
Yeah, we're close.
I use this gas station all the time.

16:46.422 --> 16:49.299
Sorry. Took a little longer than I thought.
There was a line for the bathroom.

16:49.384 --> 16:51.885
Hey-oh! Check out this couch
I found by the Dumpster.

16:52.011 --> 16:54.262
Toss it in. Nice.
Got it, buddy.

16:54.347 --> 16:57.182
Wait. What's the plan here?
You guys are still gonna ride in the back?

16:57.266 --> 16:58.850
Oh, yeah.
I sure as shit am, dude.

16:58.935 --> 17:00.936
You're not gonna get the smell of
piss out of that car for weeks.

17:01.062 --> 17:03.647
Yeah, it's pretty bad.
I'm in. Me too.

17:03.731 --> 17:05.691
You guys getting in too?
All right, let's do it.

17:05.775 --> 17:07.693
All right, whatever.
[Coughing]

17:07.777 --> 17:09.694
Have fun in the death trap!

17:09.779 --> 17:11.696
I guess I'm riding with you, bro.

17:11.781 --> 17:15.409
Hey, you're not gonna
sing to me, are you?

17:15.492 --> 17:17.411
I might.

17:17.494 --> 17:20.204
[Sighs] All right.

17:22.040 --> 17:25.042
Hey, you know, Dee, I didn't
want to say anything back there,

17:25.127 --> 17:27.045
'cause I didn't want to be
rude to the kid,

17:27.130 --> 17:29.381
but you really gotta be careful
just picking up hitchhikers.

17:29.465 --> 17:32.384
I know. But that kid was, like, really
young and sweet and innocent-looking.

17:32.468 --> 17:34.553
Right. But those are the ones
you gotta watch out for.

17:34.637 --> 17:36.555
Those are the most
dangerous hitchhikers...

17:36.639 --> 17:39.850
the ones that lure you into thinking
they're sane by acting like normal people.

17:39.934 --> 17:42.394
They act like they're normal
and then they carve you up.

17:42.478 --> 17:45.230
No way. Wasn't gonna happen.
I had my eyes on him the whole time.

17:45.314 --> 17:47.733
See, I've always got an "A,"
"B" and a "C" strike plan...

17:47.817 --> 17:50.026
to get us out of any potentially
life-threatening situation.

17:50.111 --> 17:52.028
Yeah. He probably just carved up
his mother and father,

17:52.155 --> 17:53.655
and he's running away on the road.
That's right.

17:53.740 --> 17:56.575
Could be, Frank. All I'm saying is
that I'm ready for any situation.

17:56.659 --> 17:59.369
- And that's why you're all safe
as long as I'm around. - Uh-huh.

17:59.454 --> 18:01.371
Yeah. I did an ocular pat-down
and I cleared him.

18:01.497 --> 18:03.248
Say what?
I'm sorry?

18:03.332 --> 18:05.375
I'm saying that I did an ocular
assessment of the situation,

18:05.460 --> 18:07.961
garnered that he was not a security
risk, and I cleared him for passage.

18:08.045 --> 18:09.546
[Chuckling]
"Ocular pat-down"!

18:09.630 --> 18:11.214
What in the hell
are you talking about?

18:11.299 --> 18:14.050
I'm talking about breaking down
the security situation,

18:14.135 --> 18:16.678
clearing an individual
and making it safe for passage.

18:18.598 --> 18:23.810
Well, how exactly do you view yourself
within the context of our group?

18:24.979 --> 18:26.980
The sheriff of Paddy's.

18:27.064 --> 18:28.982
Well, I can't have this
conversation right now.

18:29.066 --> 18:30.734
The sheriff of Paddy's?
Can you move?

18:30.818 --> 18:32.319
I want to unfold this thing.
I'm gonna pass out.

18:32.403 --> 18:34.988
Got a long trip ahead of us.
Careful.

18:35.072 --> 18:36.823
[Frank] I got it.

18:36.824 --> 18:36.990
[Frank] I got it.

18:37.074 --> 18:39.242
[Birds Chirping]

18:39.327 --> 18:42.954

18:43.039 --> 18:46.458
[Muttering Continues]

18:46.584 --> 18:50.003
[Grumbles]
Aah! Aah!

18:50.087 --> 18:52.130
Get off me, dude!

18:53.341 --> 18:55.342
Are we moving?

18:55.468 --> 18:57.469
I think we're stopped.
Dee, what time is it? What?

18:57.553 --> 18:59.429
Hmm?

18:59.555 --> 19:02.140
7:00 a.m. 7:00 a.m.?
Shit, we've been driving all night.

19:02.266 --> 19:04.267
We're not moving, are we?
No.

19:04.393 --> 19:06.269
Whoa. Shit.
You think we're, like, halfway there?

19:06.395 --> 19:08.021
Where do you think we are?
I wonder how far we got.

19:08.105 --> 19:10.065
[Mac] I wonder if we're like...

19:12.777 --> 19:16.154
What the hell is this?
[Frank Groans]

19:16.239 --> 19:19.199
- Oh, are we back at Paddy's?
- Wait. Where the hell is my car?

19:19.283 --> 19:20.742
Oh, goddamn!

19:20.868 --> 19:22.619
Shit balls!
What's going on?

19:23.830 --> 19:24.830
[Gasps]

19:24.914 --> 19:27.290
[Yawns] Hey, you guys are back!

19:27.375 --> 19:30.919
- How was the Grand Canyon?
- What the hell happened to my car, Charlie?

19:31.003 --> 19:34.047
I don't know. Last thing I remember,
uh, we were at the gas station.

19:34.131 --> 19:37.217
And then you guys hopped in back, and I
hopped in front with the hitchhiker.

19:37.301 --> 19:40.554
Then I got freaked out about leaving Philly,
so I asked him if he'd drop me off back here.

19:40.638 --> 19:44.057
And he said he'd take you guys to the Grand Canyon,
and then I drank all night and passed out.

19:44.141 --> 19:47.018
And then you guys were getting here now,
so I figured- Did you go and come back?

19:47.103 --> 19:49.020
He didn't take us
to the Grand Canyon.

19:49.105 --> 19:51.022
He detached the trailer
and stole my car!

19:51.148 --> 19:52.858
Really?
Yeah!

19:52.942 --> 19:55.402
The weird thing is that Mac had already
cleared him as a security risk.

19:55.486 --> 19:57.863
Did an ocular pat-down on him.
Amazing, right?

19:57.947 --> 19:59.573
- You cleared him, Mac?
- I cleared him.

19:59.699 --> 20:01.116
Goddamn it!
I thought he was clear!

20:01.242 --> 20:03.076
He wasn't clear! I'm calling the cops.
He was clear.

20:03.160 --> 20:05.453
I thought Mac cleared him.
I didn't think there'd be a problem.

20:05.580 --> 20:07.581
I don't know how- I kinda had
a good time on the trip.

20:07.665 --> 20:10.208
Looking on the bright side
of things. All right?

20:10.334 --> 20:12.586
Let's drink some beers, man.
I'm hungover as shit. Absolutely, man.

20:12.670 --> 20:16.131
- Little hair of the dog. - That was the closest
I ever got to being out of Philly, man.

20:16.215 --> 20:17.841
All right, cheers.
Cheers, you guys.

20:17.967 --> 20:19.259
Texas. Oops.
State game?

20:19.343 --> 20:20.760
Ohio.
Rhode Island.

20:20.845 --> 20:22.762
Nice.
Uh, Detroit.

20:22.847 --> 20:24.514
Nope.
That's not a state. Drink.

20:24.640 --> 20:27.309
Milwaukee!
Jesus H. Christ.
